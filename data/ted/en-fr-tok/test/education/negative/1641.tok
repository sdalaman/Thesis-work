so	i	'd	like	to	start	by	focusing	on	the	world	's	most	dangerous	animal	.
now	,	when	you	talk	about	dangerous	animals	,	most	people	might	think	of	lions	or	tigers	or	sharks	.
but	of	course	the	most	dangerous	animal	is	the	mosquito	.
the	mosquito	has	killed	more	humans	than	any	other	creature	in	human	history	.
in	fact	,	probably	adding	them	all	together	,	the	mosquito	has	killed	more	humans	.
and	the	mosquito	has	killed	more	humans	than	wars	and	plague	.
and	you	would	think	,	would	you	not	,	that	with	all	our	science	,	with	all	our	advances	in	society	,	with	better	towns	,	better	civilizations	,	better	sanitation	,	wealth	,	that	we	would	get	better	at	controlling	mosquitos	,	and	hence	reduce	this	disease	.
and	that	's	not	really	the	case	.
if	it	was	the	case	,	we	would	n't	have	between	200	and	300	million	cases	of	malaria	every	year	,	and	we	would	n't	have	a	million	and	a	half	deaths	from	malaria	,	and	we	would	n't	have	a	disease	that	was	relatively	unknown	50	years	ago	now	suddenly	turned	into	the	largest	mosquito	-	borne	virus	threat	that	we	have	,	and	that	's	called	dengue	fever	.
so	50	years	ago	,	pretty	much	no	one	had	heard	of	it	,	no	one	certainly	in	the	european	environment	.
but	dengue	fever	now	,	according	to	the	world	health	organization	,	infects	between	50	and	100	million	people	every	year	,	so	that	's	equivalent	to	the	whole	of	the	population	of	the	u.k.	being	infected	every	year	.
other	estimates	put	that	number	at	roughly	double	that	number	of	infections	.
and	dengue	fever	has	grown	in	speed	quite	phenomenally	.
in	the	last	50	years	,	the	incidence	of	dengue	has	grown	thirtyfold	.
now	let	me	tell	you	a	little	bit	about	what	dengue	fever	is	,	for	those	who	do	n't	know	.
now	let	's	assume	you	go	on	holiday	.
let	's	assume	you	go	to	the	caribbean	,	or	you	might	go	to	mexico	.	you	might	go	to	latin	america	,	asia	,	africa	,	anywhere	in	saudi	arabia	.
you	might	go	to	india	,	the	far	east	.
it	does	n't	really	matter	.	it	's	the	same	mosquito	,	and	it	's	the	same	disease	.	you	're	at	risk	.
and	let	's	assume	you	're	bitten	by	a	mosquito	that	's	carrying	that	virus	.
well	,	you	could	develop	flu	-	like	symptoms	.
they	could	be	quite	mild	.
you	could	develop	nausea	,	headache	,	and	you	could	actually	feel	like	your	bones	are	breaking	.
and	that	's	the	nickname	given	to	this	disease	.
it	's	called	breakbone	fever	,	because	that	's	how	you	can	feel	.
now	the	odd	thing	is	,	is	that	once	you	've	been	bitten	by	this	mosquito	,	and	you	've	had	this	disease	,	your	body	develops	antibodies	,	so	if	you	're	bitten	again	with	that	strain	,	it	does	n't	affect	you	.
but	it	's	not	one	virus	,	it	's	four	,	and	the	same	protection	that	gives	you	the	antibodies	and	protects	you	from	the	same	virus	that	you	had	before	actually	makes	you	much	more	susceptible	to	the	other	three	.
so	the	next	time	you	get	dengue	fever	,	if	it	's	a	different	strain	,	you	're	more	susceptible	,	you	're	likely	to	get	worse	symptoms	,	and	you	're	more	likely	to	get	the	more	severe	forms	,	hemorrhagic	fever	or	shock	syndrome	.
so	you	do	n't	want	dengue	once	,	and	you	certainly	do	n't	want	it	again	.
so	why	is	it	spreading	so	fast	?
and	the	answer	is	this	thing	.
this	is	aedes	aegypti	.
now	this	is	a	mosquito	that	came	,	like	its	name	suggests	,	out	of	north	africa	,	and	it	's	spread	round	the	world	.
now	,	in	fact	,	a	single	mosquito	will	only	travel	about	200	yards	in	its	entire	life	.	they	do	n't	travel	very	far	.
what	they	're	very	good	at	doing	is	hitchhiking	,	particularly	the	eggs	.
they	will	lay	their	eggs	in	clear	water	,	any	pool	,	any	puddle	,	any	birdbath	,	any	flower	pot	,	anywhere	there	's	clear	water	,	they	'll	lay	their	eggs	,	and	if	that	clear	water	is	near	freight	,	it	's	near	a	port	,	if	it	's	anywhere	near	transport	,	those	eggs	will	then	get	transported	around	the	world	.
and	that	's	what	's	happened	.	mankind	has	transported	these	eggs	all	the	way	around	the	world	,	and	these	insects	have	infested	over	100	countries	,	and	there	's	now	2.5	billion	people	living	in	countries	where	this	mosquito	resides	.
to	give	you	just	a	couple	of	examples	how	fast	this	has	happened	,	in	the	mid	-	'70s	,	brazil	declared	,	``	we	have	no	aedes	aegypti	,	``	and	currently	they	spend	about	a	billion	dollars	now	a	year	trying	to	get	rid	of	it	,	trying	to	control	it	,	just	one	species	of	mosquito	.
two	days	ago	,	or	yesterday	,	i	ca	n't	remember	which	,	i	saw	a	reuters	report	that	said	madeira	had	had	their	first	cases	of	dengue	,	about	52	cases	,	with	about	400	probable	cases	.
that	's	two	days	ago	.
interestingly	,	madeira	first	got	the	insect	in	2005	,	and	here	we	are	,	a	few	years	later	,	first	cases	of	dengue	.
so	the	one	thing	you	'll	find	is	that	where	the	mosquito	goes	,	dengue	will	follow	.
once	you	've	got	the	mosquito	in	your	area	,	anyone	coming	into	that	area	with	dengue	,	mosquito	will	bite	them	,	mosquito	will	bite	somewhere	else	,	somewhere	else	,	somewhere	else	,	and	you	'll	get	an	epidemic	.
so	we	must	be	good	at	killing	mosquitos	.
i	mean	,	that	ca	n't	be	very	difficult	.
well	,	there	's	two	principle	ways	.
the	first	way	is	that	you	use	larvicides	.
you	use	chemicals	.	you	put	them	into	water	where	they	breed	.
now	in	an	urban	environment	,	that	's	extraordinarily	difficult	.
you	've	got	to	get	your	chemical	into	every	puddle	,	every	birdbath	,	every	tree	trunk	.
it	's	just	not	practical	.
the	second	way	you	can	do	it	is	actually	trying	to	kill	the	insects	as	they	fly	around	.
this	is	a	picture	of	fogging	.
here	what	someone	is	doing	is	mixing	up	chemical	in	a	smoke	and	basically	spreading	that	through	the	environment	.
you	could	do	the	same	with	a	space	spray	.
this	is	really	unpleasant	stuff	,	and	if	it	was	any	good	,	we	would	n't	have	this	massive	increase	in	mosquitos	and	we	would	n't	have	this	massive	increase	in	dengue	fever	.
so	it	's	not	very	effective	,	but	it	's	probably	the	best	thing	we	've	got	at	the	moment	.
having	said	that	,	actually	,	your	best	form	of	protection	and	my	best	form	of	protection	is	a	long	-	sleeve	shirt	and	a	little	bit	of	deet	to	go	with	it	.
so	let	's	start	again	.	let	's	design	a	product	,	right	from	the	word	go	,	and	decide	what	we	want	.
well	we	clearly	need	something	that	is	effective	at	reducing	the	mosquito	population	.
there	's	no	point	in	just	killing	the	odd	mosquito	here	and	there	.
we	want	something	that	gets	that	population	right	the	way	down	so	it	ca	n't	get	the	disease	transmission	.
clearly	the	product	you	've	got	has	got	to	be	safe	to	humans	.	we	are	going	to	use	it	in	and	around	humans	.
it	has	to	be	safe	.
we	do	n't	want	to	have	a	lasting	impact	on	the	environment	.
we	do	n't	want	to	do	anything	that	you	ca	n't	undo	.
maybe	a	better	product	comes	along	in	20	,	30	years	.
fine	.	we	do	n't	want	a	lasting	environmental	impact	.
we	want	something	that	's	relatively	cheap	,	or	cost	-	effective	,	because	there	's	an	awful	lot	of	countries	involved	,	and	some	of	them	are	emerging	markets	,	some	of	them	emerging	countries	,	low	-	income	.
and	finally	,	you	want	something	that	's	species	-	specific	.
you	want	to	get	rid	of	this	mosquito	that	spreads	dengue	,	but	you	do	n't	really	want	to	get	all	the	other	insects	.
some	are	quite	beneficial	.	some	are	important	to	your	ecosystem	.
this	one	's	not	.	it	's	invaded	you	.
but	you	do	n't	want	to	get	all	of	the	insects	.
you	just	want	to	get	this	one	.
and	most	of	the	time	,	you	'll	find	this	insect	lives	in	and	around	your	home	,	so	this	--	whatever	we	do	has	got	to	get	to	that	insect	.
it	's	got	to	get	into	people	's	houses	,	into	the	bedrooms	,	into	the	kitchens	.
now	there	are	two	features	of	mosquito	biology	that	really	help	us	in	this	project	,	and	that	is	,	firstly	,	males	do	n't	bite	.
it	's	only	the	female	mosquito	that	will	actually	bite	you	.
the	male	ca	n't	bite	you	,	wo	n't	bite	you	,	does	n't	have	the	mouth	parts	to	bite	you	.
it	's	just	the	female	.
and	the	second	is	a	phenomenon	that	males	are	very	,	very	good	at	finding	females	.
if	there	's	a	male	mosquito	that	you	release	,	and	if	there	's	a	female	around	,	that	male	will	find	the	female	.
so	basically	,	we	've	used	those	two	factors	.
so	here	's	a	typical	situation	,	male	meets	female	,	lots	of	offspring	.
a	single	female	will	lay	about	up	to	100	eggs	at	a	time	,	up	to	about	500	in	her	lifetime	.
now	if	that	male	is	carrying	a	gene	which	causes	the	death	of	the	offspring	,	then	the	offspring	do	n't	survive	,	and	instead	of	having	500	mosquitos	running	around	,	you	have	none	.
and	if	you	can	put	more	,	i	'll	call	them	sterile	,	that	the	offspring	will	actually	die	at	different	stages	,	but	i	'll	call	them	sterile	for	now	.
if	you	put	more	sterile	males	out	into	the	environment	,	then	the	females	are	more	likely	to	find	a	sterile	male	than	a	fertile	one	,	and	you	will	bring	that	population	down	.
so	the	males	will	go	out	,	they	'll	look	for	females	,	they	'll	mate	.	if	they	mate	successfully	,	then	no	offspring	.
if	they	do	n't	find	a	female	,	then	they	'll	die	anyway	.
they	only	live	a	few	days	.
and	that	's	exactly	where	we	are	.
so	this	is	technology	that	was	developed	in	oxford	university	a	few	years	ago	.
the	company	itself	,	oxitec	,	we	've	been	working	for	the	last	10	years	,	very	much	on	a	sort	of	similar	development	pathway	that	you	'd	get	with	a	pharmaceutical	company	.
so	about	10	years	of	internal	evaluation	,	testing	,	to	get	this	to	a	state	where	we	think	it	's	actually	ready	.
and	then	we	've	gone	out	into	the	big	outdoors	,	always	with	local	community	consent	,	always	with	the	necessary	permits	.
so	we	've	done	field	trials	now	in	the	cayman	islands	,	a	small	one	in	malaysia	,	and	two	more	now	in	brazil	.
and	what	's	the	result	?
well	,	the	result	has	been	very	good	.
in	about	four	months	of	release	,	we	've	brought	that	population	of	mosquitos	--	in	most	cases	we	're	dealing	with	villages	here	of	about	2,000	,	3,000	people	,	that	sort	of	size	,	starting	small	--	we	've	taken	that	mosquito	population	down	by	about	85	percent	in	about	four	months	.
and	in	fact	,	the	numbers	after	that	get	,	those	get	very	difficult	to	count	,	because	there	just	are	n't	any	left	.
so	that	's	been	what	we	've	seen	in	cayman	,	it	's	been	what	we	've	seen	in	brazil	in	those	trials	.
and	now	what	we	're	doing	is	we	're	going	through	a	process	to	scale	up	to	a	town	of	about	50,000	,	so	we	can	see	this	work	at	big	scale	.
and	we	've	got	a	production	unit	in	oxford	,	or	just	south	of	oxford	,	where	we	actually	produce	these	mosquitos	.
we	can	produce	them	,	in	a	space	a	bit	more	than	this	red	carpet	,	i	can	produce	about	20	million	a	week	.
we	can	transport	them	around	the	world	.
it	's	not	very	expensive	,	because	it	's	a	coffee	cup	--	something	the	size	of	a	coffee	cup	will	hold	about	three	million	eggs	.
so	freight	costs	are	n't	our	biggest	problem	.
so	we	've	got	that	.	you	could	call	it	a	mosquito	factory	.
and	for	brazil	,	where	we	've	been	doing	some	trials	,	the	brazilian	government	themselves	have	now	built	their	own	mosquito	factory	,	far	bigger	than	ours	,	and	we	'll	use	that	for	scaling	up	in	brazil	.
there	you	are	.	we	've	sent	mosquito	eggs	.
we	've	separated	the	males	from	the	females	.
the	males	have	been	put	in	little	pots	and	the	truck	is	going	down	the	road	and	they	are	releasing	males	as	they	go	.
it	's	actually	a	little	bit	more	precise	than	that	.
you	want	to	release	them	so	that	you	get	good	coverage	of	your	area	.
so	you	take	a	google	map	,	you	divide	it	up	,	work	out	how	far	they	can	fly	,	and	make	sure	you	're	releasing	such	that	you	get	coverage	of	the	area	,	and	then	you	go	back	,	and	within	a	very	short	space	of	time	,	you	're	bringing	that	population	right	the	way	down	.
we	've	also	done	this	in	agriculture	.
we	've	got	several	different	species	of	agriculture	coming	along	,	and	i	'm	hoping	that	soon	we	'll	be	able	to	get	some	funding	together	so	we	can	get	back	and	start	looking	at	malaria	.
so	that	's	where	we	stand	at	the	moment	,	and	i	've	just	got	a	few	final	thoughts	,	which	is	that	this	is	another	way	in	which	biology	is	now	coming	in	to	supplement	chemistry	in	some	of	our	societal	advances	in	this	area	,	and	these	biological	approaches	are	coming	in	in	very	different	forms	,	and	when	you	think	about	genetic	engineering	,	we	've	now	got	enzymes	for	industrial	processing	,	enzymes	,	genetically	engineered	enzymes	in	food	.
we	have	g.m	.	crops	,	we	have	pharmaceuticals	,	we	have	new	vaccines	,	all	using	roughly	the	same	technology	,	but	with	very	different	outcomes	.
and	i	'm	in	favor	,	actually	.	of	course	i	am	.
i	'm	in	favor	of	particularly	where	the	older	technologies	do	n't	work	well	or	have	become	unacceptable	.
and	although	the	techniques	are	similar	,	the	outcomes	are	very	,	very	different	,	and	if	you	take	our	approach	,	for	example	,	and	you	compare	it	to	,	say	,	g.m	.	crops	,	both	techniques	are	trying	to	produce	a	massive	benefit	.
both	have	a	side	benefit	,	which	is	that	we	reduce	pesticide	use	tremendously	.
but	whereas	a	g.m	.	crop	is	trying	to	protect	the	plant	,	for	example	,	and	give	it	an	advantage	,	what	we	're	actually	doing	is	taking	the	mosquito	and	giving	it	the	biggest	disadvantage	it	can	possibly	have	,	rendering	it	unable	to	reproduce	effectively	.
so	for	the	mosquito	,	it	's	a	dead	end	.
thank	you	very	much	.
