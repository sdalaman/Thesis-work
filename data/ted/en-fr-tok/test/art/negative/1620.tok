hi	.	i	'm	here	to	talk	about	congestion	,	namely	road	congestion	.
road	congestion	is	a	pervasive	phenomenon	.
it	exists	in	basically	all	of	the	cities	all	around	the	world	,	which	is	a	little	bit	surprising	when	you	think	about	it	.
i	mean	,	think	about	how	different	cities	are	,	actually	.
i	mean	,	you	have	the	typical	european	cities	,	with	a	dense	urban	core	,	good	public	transportation	mostly	,	not	a	lot	of	road	capacity	.
but	then	,	on	the	other	hand	,	you	have	the	american	cities	.
it	's	moving	by	itself	,	okay	.	anyway	,	the	american	cities	:	lots	of	roads	dispersed	over	large	areas	,	almost	no	public	transportation	.
and	then	you	have	the	emerging	world	cities	,	with	a	mixed	variety	of	vehicles	,	mixed	land	-	use	patterns	,	also	rather	dispersed	but	often	with	a	very	dense	urban	core	.
and	traffic	planners	all	around	the	world	have	tried	lots	of	different	measures	:	dense	cities	or	dispersed	cities	,	lots	of	roads	or	lots	of	public	transport	or	lots	of	bike	lanes	or	more	information	,	or	lots	of	different	things	,	but	nothing	seems	to	work	.
but	all	of	these	attempts	have	one	thing	in	common	.
they	're	basically	attempts	at	figuring	out	what	people	should	do	instead	of	rush	hour	car	driving	.
they	're	essentially	,	to	a	point	,	attempts	at	planning	what	other	people	should	do	,	planning	their	life	for	them	.
now	,	planning	a	complex	social	system	is	a	very	hard	thing	to	do	,	and	let	me	tell	you	a	story	.
back	in	1989	,	when	the	berlin	wall	fell	,	an	urban	planner	in	london	got	a	phone	call	from	a	colleague	in	moscow	saying	,	basically	,	``	hi	,	this	is	vladimir	.	i	'd	like	to	know	,	who	's	in	charge	of	london	's	bread	supply	?	``	and	the	urban	planner	in	london	goes	,	``	what	do	you	mean	,	who	's	in	charge	of	london	's	--
i	mean	,	no	one	is	in	charge	.	``
``	oh	,	but	surely	someone	must	be	in	charge	.
i	mean	,	it	's	a	very	complicated	system	.	someone	must	control	all	of	this	.	``
``	no	.	no	.	no	one	is	in	charge	.
i	mean	,	it	basically	--	i	have	n't	really	thought	of	it	.
it	basically	organizes	itself	.	``
it	organizes	itself	.
that	's	an	example	of	a	complex	social	system
which	has	the	ability	of	self	-	organizing	,	and	this	is	a	very	deep	insight	.
when	you	try	to	solve	really	complex	social	problems	,	the	right	thing	to	do	is	most	of	the	time	to	create	the	incentives	.
you	do	n't	plan	the	details	,	and	people	will	figure	out	what	to	do	,	how	to	adapt	to	this	new	framework	.
and	let	's	now	look	at	how	we	can	use	this	insight	to	combat	road	congestion	.
this	is	a	map	of	stockholm	,	my	hometown	.
now	,	stockholm	is	a	medium	-	sized	city	,	roughly	two	million	people	,	but	stockholm	also	has	lots	of	water	and	lots	of	water	means	lots	of	bridges	--	narrow	bridges	,	old	bridges	--	which	means	lots	of	road	congestion	.
and	these	red	dots	show	the	most	congested	parts	,	which	are	the	bridges	that	lead	into	the	inner	city	.
and	then	someone	came	up	with	the	idea	that	,	apart	from	good	public	transport	,	apart	from	spending	money	on	roads	,	let	's	try	to	charge	drivers	one	or	two	euros	at	these	bottlenecks	.
now	,	one	or	two	euros	,	that	is	n't	really	a	lot	of	money	,	i	mean	compared	to	parking	charges	and	running	costs	,	etc	.	,	so	you	would	probably	expect	that	car	drivers	would	n't	really	react	to	this	fairly	small	charge	.
you	would	be	wrong	.
one	or	two	euros	was	enough	to	make	20	percent	of	cars	disappear	from	rush	hours	.
now	,	20	percent	,	well	,	that	's	a	fairly	huge	figure	,	you	might	think	,	but	you	've	still	got	80	percent	left	of	the	problem	,	right	?
because	you	still	have	80	percent	of	the	traffic	.
now	,	that	's	also	wrong	,	because	traffic	happens	to	be	a	nonlinear	phenomenon	,	meaning	that	once	you	reach	above	a	certain	capacity	threshold	then	congestion	starts	to	increase	really	,	really	rapidly	.
but	fortunately	,	it	also	works	the	other	way	around	.
if	you	can	reduce	traffic	even	somewhat	,	then	congestion	will	go	down	much	faster	than	you	might	think	.
now	,	congestion	charges	were	introduced	in	stockholm	on	january	3	,	2006	,	and	the	first	picture	here	is	a	picture	of	stockholm	,	one	of	the	typical	streets	,	january	2	.
the	first	day	with	the	congestion	charges	looked	like	this	.
this	is	what	happens	when	you	take	away	20	percent	of	the	cars	from	the	streets	.
you	really	reduce	congestion	quite	substantially	.
but	,	well	,	as	i	said	,	i	mean	,	car	drivers	adapt	,	right	?
so	after	a	while	they	would	all	come	back	because	they	have	sort	of	gotten	used	to	charges	.
wrong	again	.	it	's	now	six	and	a	half	years	ago	since	the	congestion	charges	were	introduced	in	stockholm	,	and	we	basically	have	the	same	low	traffic	levels	still	.
but	you	see	,	there	's	an	interesting	gap	here	in	the	time	series	in	2007	.
well	,	the	thing	is	that	,	the	congestion	charges	,	they	were	introduced	first	as	a	trial	,	so	they	were	introduced	in	january	and	then	abolished	again	at	the	end	of	july	,	followed	by	a	referendum	,	and	then	they	were	reintroduced	again	in	2007	,	which	of	course	was	a	wonderful	scientific	opportunity	.
i	mean	,	this	was	a	really	fun	experiment	to	start	with	,	and	we	actually	got	to	do	it	twice	.
and	personally	,	i	would	like	to	do	this	every	once	a	year	or	so	,	but	they	wo	n't	let	me	do	that	.
but	it	was	fun	anyway	.
so	,	we	followed	up	.	what	happened	?
this	is	the	last	day	with	the	congestion	charges	,	july	31	,	and	you	see	the	same	street	but	now	it	's	summer	,	and	summer	in	stockholm	is	a	very	nice	and	light	time	of	the	year	,	and	the	first	day	without	the	congestion	charges	looked	like	this	.
all	the	cars	were	back	again	,	and	you	even	have	to	admire	the	car	drivers	.	they	adapt	so	extremely	quickly	.
the	first	day	they	all	came	back	.
and	this	effect	hanged	on	.	so	2007	figures	looked	like	this	.
now	these	traffic	figures	are	really	exciting	and	a	little	bit	surprising	and	very	useful	to	know	,	but	i	would	say	that	the	most	surprising	slide	here	i	'm	going	to	show	you	today	is	not	this	one	.	it	's	this	one	.
this	shows	public	support	for	congestion	pricing	of	stockholm	,	and	you	see	that	when	congestion	pricing	were	introduced	in	the	beginning	of	spring	2006	,	people	were	fiercely	against	it	.
seventy	percent	of	the	population	did	n't	want	this	.
but	what	happened	when	the	congestion	charges	were	there	is	not	what	you	would	expect	,	that	people	hated	it	more	and	more	.
no	,	on	the	contrary	,	they	changed	,	up	to	a	point	where	we	now	have	70	percent	support	for	keeping	the	charges	,	meaning	that	--	i	mean	,	let	me	repeat	that	:	70	percent	of	the	population	in	stockholm	want	to	keep	a	price	for	something	that	used	to	be	free	.
okay	.	so	why	can	that	be	?	why	is	that	?
well	,	think	about	it	this	way	.	who	changed	?
i	mean	,	the	20	percent	of	the	car	drivers	that	disappeared	,	surely	they	must	be	discontent	in	a	way	.
and	where	did	they	go	?	if	we	can	understand	this	,	then	maybe	we	can	figure	out	how	people	can	be	so	happy	with	this	.
well	,	so	we	did	this	huge	interview	survey	with	lots	of	travel	services	,	and	tried	to	figure	out	who	changed	,	and	where	did	they	go	?
and	it	turned	out	that	they	do	n't	know	themselves	.
for	some	reason	,	the	car	drivers	are	--	they	are	confident	they	actually	drive	the	same	way	that	they	used	to	do	.
and	why	is	that	?	it	's	because	that	travel	patterns	are	much	less	stable	than	you	might	think	.
each	day	,	people	make	new	decisions	,	and	people	change	and	the	world	changes	around	them	,	and	each	day	all	of	these	decisions	are	sort	of	nudged	ever	so	slightly	away	from	rush	hour	car	driving	in	a	way	that	people	do	n't	even	notice	.
they	're	not	even	aware	of	this	themselves	.
and	the	other	question	,	who	changed	their	mind	?
who	changed	their	opinion	,	and	why	?
so	we	did	another	interview	survey	,	tried	to	figure	out	why	people	changed	their	mind	,	and	what	type	of	group	changed	their	minds	?
and	after	analyzing	the	answers	,	it	turned	out	that	more	than	half	of	them	believe	that	they	have	n't	changed	their	minds	.
they	're	actually	confident	that	they	have	liked	congestion	pricing	all	along	.
which	means	that	we	are	now	in	a	position	where	we	have	reduced	traffic	across	this	toll	cordon	with	20	percent	,	and	reduced	congestion	by	enormous	numbers	,	and	people	are	n't	even	aware	that	they	have	changed	,	and	they	honestly	believe	that	they	have	liked	this	all	along	.
this	is	the	power	of	nudges	when	trying	to	solve	complex	social	problems	,	and	when	you	do	that	,	you	should	n't	try	to	tell	people	how	to	adapt	.
you	should	just	nudge	them	in	the	right	direction	.
and	if	you	do	it	right	,	people	will	actually	embrace	the	change	,	and	if	you	do	it	right	,	people	will	actually	even	like	it	.
thank	you	.
