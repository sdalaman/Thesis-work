in	system	d	,	this	is	a	store	,	and	what	i	mean	by	that	is	that	this	is	a	photograph	i	took	in	makoko	,	shantytown	in	lagos	,	nigeria	.
it	's	built	over	the	lagoon	,	and	there	are	no	streets	where	there	can	be	stores	to	shop	,	and	so	the	store	comes	to	you	.
and	in	the	same	community	,	this	is	business	synergy	.
this	is	the	boat	that	that	lady	was	paddling	around	in	,	and	this	artisan	makes	the	boat	and	the	paddles	and	sells	directly	to	the	people	who	need	the	boat	and	the	paddles	.
and	this	is	a	global	business	.
ogandiro	smokes	fish	in	makoko	in	lagos	,	and	i	asked	her	,	``	where	does	the	fish	come	from	?	``
and	i	thought	she	'd	say	,	``	oh	,	you	know	,	up	the	lagoon	somewhere	,	or	maybe	across	africa	,	``
but	you	'll	be	happy	to	know	she	said	it	came	from	here	,	it	comes	from	the	north	sea	.
it	's	caught	here	,	frozen	,	shipped	down	to	lagos	,	smoked	,	and	sold	for	a	tiny	increment	of	profit	on	the	streets	of	lagos	.
and	this	is	a	business	incubator	.
this	is	olusosun	dump	,	the	largest	garbage	dump	in	lagos	,	and	2,000	people	work	here	,	and	i	found	this	out	from	this	fellow	,	andrew	saboru	.
andrew	spent	16	years	scavenging	materials	on	the	dump	,	earned	enough	money	to	turn	himself	into	a	contract	scaler	,	which	meant	he	carried	a	scale	and	went	around	and	weighed	all	the	materials	that	people	had	scavenged	from	the	dump	.	now	he	's	a	scrap	dealer	.
that	's	his	little	depot	behind	him	,	and	he	earns	twice	the	nigerian	minimum	wage	.
this	is	a	shopping	mall	.
this	is	oshodi	market	in	lagos	.
jorge	luis	borges	had	a	story	called	``	the	aleph	,	``	and	the	aleph	is	a	point	in	the	world	where	absolutely	everything	exists	,	and	for	me	,	this	image	is	a	point	in	the	world	where	absolutely	everything	exists	.
so	,	what	am	i	talking	about	when	i	talk	about	system	d	?
it	's	traditionally	called	the	informal	economy	,	the	underground	economy	,	the	black	market	.
i	do	n't	conceive	of	it	that	way	.
i	think	it	's	really	important	to	understand	that	something	like	this	is	totally	open	.	it	's	right	there	for	you	to	find	.
all	of	this	is	happening	openly	,	and	aboveboard	.
there	's	nothing	underground	about	it	.
it	's	our	prejudgment	that	it	's	underground	.
i	've	pirated	the	term	system	d	from	the	former	french	colonies	.
there	's	a	word	in	french	that	is	débrouillardise	,	that	means	to	be	self	-	reliant	,	and	the	former	french	colonies	have	turned	that	into	system	d	for	the	economy	of	self	-	reliance	,	or	the	diy	economy	.
but	governments	hate	the	diy	economy	,	and	that	's	why	--	i	took	this	picture	in	2007	,	and	this	is	the	same	market	in	2009	--	and	i	think	,	when	the	organizers	of	this	conference	were	talking	about	radical	openness	,	they	did	n't	mean	that	the	streets	should	be	open	and	the	people	should	be	gone	.
i	think	what	we	have	is	a	pickle	problem	.
i	had	a	friend	who	worked	at	a	pickle	factory	,
and	the	cucumbers	would	come	flying	down	this	conveyer	belt	,	and	his	job	was	to	pick	off	the	ones	that	did	n't	look	so	good	and	throw	them	in	the	bin	labeled	``	relish	``	where	they	'd	be	crushed	and	mixed	with	vinegar	and	used	for	other	kinds	of	profit	.
this	is	the	pickle	economy	.
we	're	all	focusing	on	--	this	is	a	statistic	from	earlier	this	month	in	the	financial	times	--	we	're	all	focusing	on	the	luxury	economy	.
it	's	worth	1.5	trillion	dollars	every	year	,	and	that	's	a	vast	amount	of	money	,	right	?
that	's	three	times	the	gross	domestic	product	of	switzerland	.
so	it	's	vast	.	but	it	should	come	with	an	asterisk	,	and	the	asterisk	is	that	it	excludes	two	thirds	of	the	workers	of	the	world	.
1.8	billion	people	around	the	world	work	in	the	economy	that	is	unregulated	and	informal	.
that	's	a	huge	number	,	and	what	does	that	mean	?
well	,	it	means	if	it	were	united	in	a	single	political	system	,	one	country	,	call	it	``	the	united	street	sellers	republic	,	``	the	u.s.s.r.	,	or	``	bazaaristan	,	``	it	would	be	worth	10	trillion	dollars	every	year	,	and	that	would	make	it	the	second	largest	economy	in	the	world	,	after	the	united	states	.
and	given	that	projections	are	that	the	bulk	of	economic	growth	over	the	next	15	years	will	come	from	emerging	economies	in	the	developing	world	,	it	could	easily	overtake	the	united	states	and	become	the	largest	economy	in	the	world	.
so	the	implications	of	that	are	vast	,	because	it	means	that	this	is	where	employment	is	--	1.8	billion	people	--	and	this	is	where	we	can	create	a	more	egalitarian	world	,	because	people	are	actually	able	to	earn	money	and	live	and	thrive	,	as	andrew	saboru	did	.
big	businesses	have	recognized	this	,	and	what	's	fascinating	about	this	slide	,	it	's	not	that	the	guys	can	carry	boxes	on	their	heads	and	run	around	without	dropping	them	off	.	it	's	that	the	gala	sausage	roll	is	a	product	that	's	made	by	a	global	company	called	uac	foods	that	's	active	throughout	africa	and	the	middle	east	,	but	the	gala	sausage	roll	is	not	sold	in	stores	.
uac	foods	has	recognized	that	it	wo	n't	sell	if	it	's	in	stores	.	it	's	only	sold	by	a	phalanx	of	street	hawkers	who	run	around	the	streets	of	lagos	at	bus	stations	and	in	traffic	jams	and	sell	it	as	a	snack	,	and	it	's	been	sold	that	way	for	40	years	.
it	's	a	business	plan	for	a	corporation	.
and	it	's	not	just	in	africa	.
here	's	mr.	clean	looking	amorously	at	all	the	other	procter	&	gamble	products	,	and	procter	&	gamble	,	you	know	,	the	statistic	always	cited	is	that	wal	-	mart	is	their	largest	customer	,	and	it	's	true	,	as	one	store	,	wal	-	mart	buys	15	percent	,	thus	15	percent	of	procter	&	gamble	's	business	is	with	wal	-	mart	,	but	their	largest	market	segment	is	something	that	they	call	``	high	frequency	stores	,	``	which	is	all	these	tiny	kiosks	and	the	lady	in	the	canoe	and	all	these	other	businesses	that	exist	in	system	d	,	the	informal	economy	,	and	procter	&	gamble	makes	20	percent	of	its	money	from	that	market	segment	,	and	it	's	the	only	market	segment	that	's	growing	.
so	procter	&	gamble	says	,	``	we	do	n't	care	whether	a	store	is	incorporated	or	registered	or	anything	like	that	.
we	want	our	products	in	that	store	.	``
and	then	there	's	mobile	phones	.
this	is	an	ad	for	mtn	,	which	is	a	south	african	multinational	active	in	about	25	countries	,	and	when	they	came	into	nigeria	--	nigeria	is	the	big	dog	in	africa	.
one	in	seven	africans	is	a	nigerian	,	and	so	everyone	wants	in	to	the	mobile	phone	market
in	nigeria	.	and	when	mtn	came	in	,	they	wanted	to	sell	the	mobile	service	like	i	get	in	the	united	states	or	like	people	get	here	in	the	u.k.	or	in	europe	--	expensive	monthly	plans	,	you	get	a	phone	,	you	pay	overages	,	you	're	killed	with	fees	--	and	their	plan	crashed	and	burned	.
and	they	went	back	to	the	drawing	board	,	and	they	retooled	,	and	they	came	up	with	another	plan	:	we	do	n't	sell	you	the	phone	,	we	do	n't	sell	you	the	monthly	plan	.
we	only	sell	you	airtime	.
and	where	's	the	airtime	sold	?
it	's	sold	at	umbrella	stands	all	over	the	streets	,	where	people	are	unregistered	,	unlicensed	,	but	mtn	makes	most	of	its	profits	,	perhaps	90	percent	of	its	profits	,	from	selling	through	system	d	,	the	informal	economy	.
and	where	do	the	phones	come	from	?
well	,	they	come	from	here	.	this	is	in	guangzhou	,	china	,	and	if	you	go	upstairs	in	this	rather	sleepy	looking	electronics	mall	,	you	find	the	guangzhou	dashatou	second	-	hand	trade	center	,
and	if	you	go	in	there	,	you	follow	the	guys	with	the	muscles	who	are	carrying	the	boxes	,	and	where	are	they	going	?
they	're	going	to	eddy	in	lagos	.
now	,	most	of	the	phones	there	are	not	second	-	hand	at	all	.
the	name	is	a	misnomer	.
most	of	them	are	pirated	.	they	have	the	name	brand	on	them	,	but	they	're	not	manufactured	by	the	name	brand	.
now	,	are	there	downsides	to	that	?
well	,	i	guess	.	you	know	,	china	has	no	--	--	no	intellectual	property	,	right	?
versace	without	the	vowels	.
zhuomani	instead	of	armani	.
s.	guuuci	,	and	--	all	around	the	world	this	is	how	products	are	being	distributed	,	so	,	for	instance	,	in	one	street	market	on	rua	25	de	março	in	são	paulo	,	brazil	,	you	can	buy	fake	designer	glasses	.
you	can	buy	cloned	cologne	.
you	can	buy	pirated	dvds	,	of	course	.
you	can	buy	new	york	yankees	caps	in	all	sorts	of	unauthorized	patterns	.
you	can	buy	cuecas	baratas	,	designer	underwear	that	is	n't	really	manufactured	by	a	designer	,	and	even	pirated	evangelical	mixtapes	.
now	,	businesses	tend	to	complain	about	this	,	and	their	,	they	,	i	do	n't	want	to	take	away	from	their	entire	validity	of	complaining	about	it	,	but	i	did	ask	a	major	sneaker	manufacturer	earlier	this	year	what	they	thought	about	piracy	,
and	they	told	me	,	``	well	,	you	ca	n't	quote	me	on	this	,	because	if	you	quote	me	on	this	,	i	have	to	kill	you	,	``	but	they	use	piracy	as	market	research	.
the	sneaker	manufacturer	told	me	that	if	they	find	that	pumas	are	being	pirated	,	or	adidas	are	being	pirated	and	their	sneakers	are	n't	being	pirated	,	they	know	they	've	done	something	wrong	.
so	it	's	very	important	to	them	to	track	piracy	exactly	because	of	this	,	and	the	people	who	are	buying	,	the	pirates	,	are	not	their	customers	anyway	,	because	their	customers	want	the	real	deal	.
now	,	there	's	another	problem	.
this	is	a	real	street	sign	in	lagos	,	nigeria	.
all	of	system	d	really	does	n't	pay	taxes	,	right	?
and	when	i	think	about	that	,	first	of	all	i	think	that	government	is	a	social	contract	between	the	people	and	the	government	,	and	if	the	government	is	n't	transparent	,	then	the	people	are	n't	going	to	be	transparent	either	,
but	also	that	we	're	blaming	the	little	guy	who	does	n't	pay	his	taxes	,	and	we	're	not	recognizing	that	everyone	's	fudging	things	all	over	the	world	,	including	some	extremely	respected	businesses	,	and	i	'll	give	you	one	example	.
there	was	one	company	that	paid	4,000	bribes	in	the	first	decade	of	this	millennium	,	and	a	million	dollars	in	bribes	every	business	day	,	right	?
all	over	the	world	.	and	that	company	was	the	big	german	electronics	giant	siemens	.
so	this	goes	on	in	the	formal	economy	as	well	as	the	informal	economy	,	so	it	's	wrong	of	us	to	blame	--	and	i	'm	not	singling	out	siemens	,	i	'm	saying	everyone	does	it	.	okay	?
i	just	want	to	end	by	saying	that	if	adam	smith	had	framed	out	a	theory	of	the	flea	market	instead	of	the	free	market	,	what	would	be	sum	of	the	principles	?
first	,	it	would	be	to	understand	that	it	could	be	considered	a	cooperative	,	and	this	is	a	thought	from	the	brazilian	legal	scholar	roberto	mangabeira	unger	.
cooperative	development	is	a	way	forward	.
secondly	,	from	the	[	austrian	]	anarchist	philosopher	paul	feyerabend	,	facts	are	relative	,	and	what	is	a	massive	right	of	self	-	reliance	to	a	nigerian	businessperson	is	considered	unauthorized	and	horrible	to	other	people	,	and	we	have	to	recognize	that	there	are	differences	in	how	people	define	things	and	what	their	facts	are	.
and	third	is	,	and	i	'm	taking	this	from	the	great	american	beat	poet	allen	ginsberg	,	that	alternate	economies	barter	and	different	kinds	of	currency	,	alternate	currencies	are	also	very	important	,	and	he	talked	about	buying	what	he	needed	just	with	his	good	looks	.
and	so	i	just	want	to	leave	you	there	,	and	say	that	this	economy	is	a	tremendous	force	for	global	development	and	we	need	to	think	about	it	that	way	.
thank	you	very	much	.
