i	'm	going	to	talk	about	the	power	of	a	word	:	jihad	.	to	the	vast	majority	of	practicing	muslims	,	jihad	is	an	internal	struggle	for	the	faith	.
it	is	a	struggle	within	,	a	struggle	against	vice	,	sin	,	temptation	,	lust	,	greed	.
it	is	a	struggle	to	try	and	live	a	life	that	is	set	by	the	moral	codes	written	in	the	koran	.
in	that	original	idea	,	the	concept	of	jihad	is	as	important	to	muslims	as	the	idea	of	grace	is	to	christians	.
it	's	a	very	powerful	word	,	jihad	,	if	you	look	at	it	in	that	respect	,	and	there	's	a	certain	almost	mystical	resonance	to	it	.
and	that	's	the	reason	why	,	for	hundreds	of	years	,	muslims	everywhere	have	named	their	children	jihad	,	their	daughters	as	much	as	their	sons	,	in	the	same	way	that	,	say	,	christians	name	their	daughters	grace	,	and	hindus	,	my	people	,	name	our	daughters	bhakti	,	which	means	,	in	sanskrit	,	spiritual	worship	.
but	there	have	always	been	,	in	islam	,	a	small	group	,	a	minority	,	who	believe	that	jihad	is	not	only	an	internal	struggle	but	also	an	external	struggle	against	forces	that	would	threaten	the	faith	,	or	the	faithul	.
and	some	of	these	people	believe	that	in	that	struggle	,	it	is	sometimes	okay	to	take	up	arms	.
and	so	the	thousands	of	young	muslim	men	who	flocked	to	afghanistan	in	the	1980s	to	fight	against	the	soviet	occupation	of	a	muslim	country	,	in	their	minds	they	were	fighting	a	jihad	,	they	were	doing	jihad	,	and	they	named	themselves	the	mujahideen	,	which	is	a	word	that	comes	from	the	same	root	as	jihad	.
and	we	forget	this	now	,	but	back	then	the	mujahideen	were	celebrated	in	this	country	,	in	america	.
we	thought	of	them	as	holy	warriors	who	were	taking	the	good	fight	to	the	ungodly	communists	.
america	gave	them	weapons	,	gave	them	money	,	gave	them	support	,	encouragement	.
but	within	that	group	,	a	tiny	,	smaller	group	,	a	minority	within	a	minority	within	a	minority	,	were	coming	up	with	a	new	and	dangerous	conception	of	jihad	,	and	in	time	this	group	would	come	to	be	led	by	osama	bin	laden	,	and	he	refined	the	idea	.
his	idea	of	jihad	was	a	global	war	of	terror	,	primarily	targeted	at	the	far	enemy	,	at	the	crusaders	from	the	west	,	against	america	.
and	the	things	he	did	in	the	pursuit	of	this	jihad	were	so	horrendous	,	so	monstrous	,	and	had	such	great	impact	,	that	his	definition	was	the	one	that	stuck	,	not	just	here	in	the	west	.
we	did	n't	know	any	better	.	we	did	n't	pause	to	ask	.
we	just	assumed	that	if	this	insane	man	and	his	psychopathic	followers	were	calling	what	they	did	jihad	,	then	that	's	what	jihad	must	mean	.
but	it	was	n't	just	us	.	even	in	the	muslim	world	,	his	definition	of	jihad	began	to	gain	acceptance	.
a	year	ago	i	was	in	tunis	,	and	i	met	the	imam	of	a	very	small	mosque	,	an	old	man	.
fifteen	years	ago	,	he	named	his	granddaughter	jihad	,	after	the	old	meaning	.	he	hoped	that	a	name	like	that	would	inspire	her	to	live	a	spiritual	life	.
but	he	told	me	that	after	9/11	,	he	began	to	have	second	thoughts	.
he	worried	that	if	he	called	her	by	that	name	,	especially	outdoors	,	outside	in	public	,	he	might	be	seen	as	endorsing	bin	laden	's	idea	of	jihad	.
on	fridays	in	his	mosque	,	he	gave	sermons	trying	to	reclaim	the	meaning	of	the	word	,	but	his	congregants	,	the	people	who	came	to	his	mosque	,	they	had	seen	the	videos	.	they	had	seen	pictures	of	the	planes	going	into	the	towers	,	the	towers	coming	down	.
they	had	heard	bin	laden	say	that	that	was	jihad	,	and	claimed	victory	for	it	.	and	so	the	old	imam	worried	that	his	words	were	falling	on	deaf	ears	.	no	one	was	paying	attention	.
he	was	wrong	.	some	people	were	paying	attention	,	but	for	the	wrong	reasons	.
the	united	states	,	at	this	point	,	was	putting	pressure	on	all	its	arab	allies	,	including	tunisia	,	to	stamp	out	extremism	in	their	societies	,	and	this	imam	found	himself	suddenly	in	the	crosshairs	of	the	tunisian	intelligence	service	.
they	had	never	paid	him	any	attention	before	--	old	man	,	small	mosque	--	but	now	they	began	to	pay	visits	,	and	sometimes	they	would	drag	him	in	for	questions	,	and	always	the	same	question	:	``	why	did	you	name	your	granddaughter	jihad	?
why	do	you	keep	using	the	word	jihad	in	your	friday	sermons	?
do	you	hate	americans	?
what	is	your	connection	to	osama	bin	laden	?	``
so	to	the	tunisian	intelligence	agency	,	and	organizations	like	it	all	over	the	arab	world	,	jihad	equaled	extremism	,	bin	laden	's	definition	had	become	institutionalized	.
that	was	the	power	of	that	word	that	he	was	able	to	do	.
and	it	filled	this	old	imam	,	it	filled	him	with	great	sadness	.
he	told	me	that	,	of	bin	laden	's	many	crimes	,	this	was	,	in	his	mind	,	one	that	did	n't	get	enough	attention	,	that	he	took	this	word	,	this	beautiful	idea	.
he	did	n't	so	much	appropriate	it	as	kidnapped	it	and	debased	it	and	corrupted	it	and	turned	it	into	something	it	was	never	meant	to	be	,	and	then	persuaded	all	of	us	that	it	always	was	a	global	jihad	.
but	the	good	news	is	that	the	global	jihad	is	almost	over	,	as	bin	laden	defined	it	.
it	was	dying	well	before	he	did	,	and	now	it	's	on	its	last	legs	.
opinion	polls	from	all	over	the	muslim	world	show	that	there	is	very	little	interest	among	muslims	in	a	global	holy	war	against	the	west	,	against	the	far	enemy	.
the	supply	of	young	men	willing	to	fight	and	die	for	this	cause	is	dwindling	.
the	supply	of	money	--	just	as	important	,	more	important	perhaps	--	the	supply	of	money	to	this	activity	is	also	dwindling	.
the	wealthy	fanatics	who	were	previously	sponsoring	this	kind	of	activity	are	now	less	generous	.
what	does	that	mean	for	us	in	the	west	?
does	it	mean	we	can	break	out	the	champagne	,	wash	our	hands	of	it	,	disengage	,	sleep	easy	at	night	?
no	.	disengagement	is	not	an	option	,	because	if	you	let	local	jihad	survive	,	it	becomes	international	jihad	.
and	so	there	's	now	a	lot	of	different	violent	jihads	all	over	the	world	.
in	somalia	,	in	mali	,	in	nigeria	,	in	iraq	,	in	afghanistan	,	pakistan	,	there	are	groups	that	claim	to	be	the	inheritors	of	the	legacy	of	osama	bin	laden	.
they	use	his	rhetoric	.
they	even	use	the	brand	name	he	created	for	his	jihad	.
so	there	is	now	an	al	qaeda	in	the	islamic	maghreb	,	there	's	an	al	qaeda	in	the	arabian	peninsula	,	there	is	an	al	qaeda	in	mesopotamia	.
there	are	other	groups	--	in	nigeria	,	boko	haram	,	in	somalia	,	al	shabaab	--	and	they	all	pay	homage	to	osama	bin	laden	.
but	if	you	look	closely	,	they	're	not	fighting	a	global	jihad	.
they	're	fighting	battles	over	much	narrower	issues	.
usually	it	has	to	do	with	ethnicity	or	race	or	sectarianism	,	or	it	's	a	power	struggle	.
more	often	than	not	,	it	's	a	power	struggle	in	one	country	,	or	even	a	small	region	within	one	country	.
occasionally	they	will	go	across	a	border	,	from	iraq	to	syria	,	from	mali	to	algeria	,	from	somalia	to	kenya	,	but	they	're	not	fighting	a	global	jihad	against	some	far	enemy	.
but	that	does	n't	mean	that	we	can	relax	.
i	was	in	yemen	recently	,	where	--	it	's	the	home	of	the	last	al	qaeda	franchise	that	still	aspires	to	attack	america	,	attack	the	west	.
it	's	old	school	al	qaeda	.
you	may	remember	these	guys	.
they	are	the	ones	who	tried	to	send	the	underwear	bomber	here	,	and	they	were	using	the	internet	to	try	and	instigate	violence	among	american	muslims	.
but	they	have	been	distracted	recently	.
last	year	,	they	took	control	over	a	portion	of	southern	yemen	,	and	ran	it	,	taliban	-	style	.
and	then	the	yemeni	military	got	its	act	together	,	and	ordinary	people	rose	up	against	these	guys	and	drove	them	out	,	and	since	then	,	most	of	their	activities	,	most	of	their	attacks	have	been	directed	at	yemenis	.
so	i	think	we	've	come	to	a	point	now	where	we	can	say	that	,	just	like	all	politics	,	all	jihad	is	local	.
but	that	's	still	not	reason	for	us	to	disengage	,	because	we	've	seen	that	movie	before	,	in	afghanistan	.
when	those	mujahideen	defeated	the	soviet	union	,	we	disengaged	.
and	even	before	the	fizz	had	gone	out	of	our	celebratory	champagne	,	the	taliban	had	taken	over	in	kabul	,	and	we	said	,	``	local	jihad	,	not	our	problem	.	``
and	then	the	taliban	gave	the	keys	of	kandahar	to	osama	bin	laden	.	he	made	it	our	problem	.
local	jihad	,	if	you	ignore	it	,	becomes	global	jihad	again	.
the	good	news	is	that	it	does	n't	have	to	be	.
we	know	how	to	fight	it	now	.
we	have	the	tools	.	we	have	the	knowhow	,	and	we	can	take	the	lessons	we	've	learned	from	the	fight	against	global	jihad	,	the	victory	against	global	jihad	,	and	apply	those	to	local	jihad	.
what	are	those	lessons	?	we	know	who	killed	bin	laden	:	seal	team	six	.
do	we	know	,	do	we	understand	,	who	killed	bin	ladenism	?
who	ended	the	global	jihad	?
there	lie	the	answers	to	the	solution	to	local	jihad	.
who	killed	bin	ladenism	?	let	's	start	with	bin	laden	himself	.
he	probably	thought	9/11	was	his	greatest	achievement	.
in	reality	,	it	was	the	beginning	of	the	end	for	him	.
he	killed	3,000	innocent	people	,	and	that	filled	the	muslim	world	with	horror	and	revulsion	,	and	what	that	meant	was	that	his	idea	of	jihad	could	never	become	mainstream	.
he	condemned	himself	to	operating	on	the	lunatic	fringes	of	his	own	community	.
9/11	did	n't	empower	him	;	it	doomed	him	.
who	killed	bin	ladenism	?	abu	musab	al-zarqawi	killed	it	.
he	was	the	especially	sadistic	head	of	al	qaeda	in	iraq	who	sent	hundreds	of	suicide	bombers	to	attack	not	americans	but	iraqis	.	muslims	.	sunni	as	well	as	shiites	.
any	claim	that	al	qaeda	had	to	being	protectors	of	islam	against	the	western	crusaders	was	drowned	in	the	blood	of	iraqi	muslims	.
who	killed	osama	bin	laden	?	the	seal	team	six	.
who	killed	bin	ladenism	?	al	jazeera	did	,
al	jazeera	and	half	a	dozen	other	satellite	news	stations	in	arabic	,	because	they	circumvented	the	old	,	state	-	owned	television	stations	in	a	lot	of	these	countries	which	were	designed	to	keep	information	from	people	.
al	jazeera	brought	information	to	them	,	showed	them	what	was	being	said	and	done	in	the	name	of	their	religion	,	exposed	the	hypocrisy	of	osama	bin	laden	and	al	qaeda	,	and	allowed	them	,	gave	them	the	information	that	allowed	them	to	come	to	their	own	conclusions	.	who	killed	bin	ladenism	?	the	arab	spring	did	,	because	it	showed	a	way	for	young	muslims	to	bring	about	change	in	a	manner	that	osama	bin	laden	,	with	his	limited	imagination	,	could	never	have	conceived	.
who	defeated	the	global	jihad	?	the	american	military	did	,	the	american	soldiers	did	,	with	their	allies	,	fighting	in	faraway	battlefields	.
and	perhaps	,	a	time	will	come	when	they	get	the	rightful	credit	for	it	.
so	all	these	factors	,	and	many	more	besides	,	we	do	n't	even	fully	understand	some	of	them	yet	,	these	came	together	to	defeat	a	monstrosity	as	big	as	bin	ladenism	,	the	global	jihad	,	you	needed	this	group	effort	.
now	,	not	all	of	these	things	will	work	in	local	jihad	.
the	american	military	is	not	going	to	march	into	nigeria	to	take	on	boko	haram	,	and	it	's	unlikely	that	seal	team	six	will	rappel	into	the	homes	of	al	shabaab	's	leaders	and	take	them	out	.
but	many	of	these	other	factors	that	were	in	play	are	now	even	stronger	than	before	.	half	the	work	is	already	done	.
we	do	n't	have	to	reinvent	the	wheel	.
the	notion	of	violent	jihad	in	which	more	muslims	are	killed	than	any	other	kind	of	people	is	already	thoroughly	discredited	.
we	do	n't	have	to	go	back	to	that	.
satellite	television	and	the	internet	are	informing	and	empowering	young	muslims	in	exciting	new	ways	.
and	the	arab	spring	has	produced	governments	,	many	of	them	islamist	governments	,	who	know	that	,	for	their	own	self	-	preservation	,	they	need	to	take	on	the	extremists	in	their	midsts	.
we	do	n't	need	to	persuade	them	,	but	we	do	need	to	help	them	,	because	they	have	n't	really	come	to	this	place	before	.
the	good	news	,	again	,	is	that	a	lot	of	the	things	they	need	we	already	have	,	and	we	are	very	good	at	giving	:	economic	assistance	,	not	just	money	,	but	expertise	,	technology	,	knowhow	,	private	investment	,	fair	terms	of	trade	,	medicine	,	education	,	technical	support	for	training	for	their	police	forces	to	become	more	effective	,	for	their	anti	-	terror	forces	to	become	more	efficient	.
we	've	got	plenty	of	these	things	.
some	of	the	other	things	that	they	need	we	're	not	very	good	at	giving	.	maybe	nobody	is	.
time	,	patience	,	subtlety	,	understanding	--	these	are	harder	to	give	.
i	live	in	new	york	now	.	just	this	week	,	posters	have	gone	up	in	subway	stations	in	new	york	that	describe	jihad	as	savage	.
but	in	all	the	many	years	that	i	have	covered	the	middle	east	,	i	have	never	been	as	optimistic	as	i	am	today	that	the	gap	between	the	muslim	world	and	the	west	is	narrowing	fast	,	and	one	of	the	many	reasons	for	my	optimism	is	that	,	because	i	know	there	are	millions	,	hundreds	of	millions	of	people	,	muslims	like	that	old	imam	in	tunis	,	who	are	reclaiming	this	word	and	restoring	to	its	original	,	beautiful	purpose	.
bin	laden	is	dead	.	bin	ladenism	has	been	defeated	.
his	definition	of	jihad	can	now	be	expunged	.
to	that	jihad	we	can	say	,	``	goodbye	.	good	riddance	.	``
to	the	real	jihad	we	can	say	,	``	welcome	back	.	good	luck	.	``
thank	you	.
