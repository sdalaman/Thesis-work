so	let	me	start	by	taking	you	back	,	back	into	the	mists	of	your	memory	to	perhaps	the	most	anticipated	year	in	your	life	,	but	certainly	the	most	anticipated	year	in	all	human	history	:	the	year	2000	.	remember	that	?
y	2k	,	the	dotcom	bubble	,	stressing	about	whose	party	you	're	going	to	go	to	as	the	clock	strikes	midnight	,	before	the	champagne	goes	flat	,	and	then	there	's	that	inchoate	yearning	that	was	felt	,	i	think	,	by	many	,	that	the	millennium	,	that	the	year	2000	,	should	mean	more	,	more	than	just	a	two	and	some	zeroes	.
well	,	amazingly	,	for	once	,	our	world	leaders	actually	lived	up	to	that	millennium	moment	and	back	in	2000	agreed	to	some	pretty	extraordinary	stuff	:	visionary	,	measurable	,	long	-	term	targets	called	the	millennium	development	goals	.	now	,	i	'm	sure	you	all	keep	a	copy	of	the	goals	under	your	pillow	,	or	by	the	bedside	table	,	but	just	in	case	you	do	n't	,	and	your	memory	needs	some	jogging	,	the	deal	agreed	then	goes	like	this	:	developing	countries	promised	to	at	least	halve	extreme	poverty	,	hunger	and	deaths	from	disease	,	alongside	some	other	targets	,	by	2015	,	and	developed	nations	promised	to	help	them	get	that	done	by	dropping	debts	,	increasing	smart	aid	,	and	trade	reform	.
well	,	we	're	approaching	2015	,	so	we	'd	better	assess	,	how	are	we	doing	on	these	goals	?
but	we	've	also	got	to	decide	,	do	we	like	such	global	goals	?
some	people	do	n't	.	and	if	we	like	them	,	we	've	got	to	decide	what	we	want	to	do	on	these	goals	going	forward	.
what	does	the	world	want	to	do	together	?
we	've	got	to	decide	a	process	by	which	we	decide	.
well	,	i	definitely	think	these	goals	are	worth	building	on	and	seeing	through	,	and	here	's	just	a	few	reasons	why	.
incredible	partnerships	between	the	private	sector	,	political	leaders	,	philanthropists	and	amazing	grassroots	activists	across	the	developing	world	,	but	also	250,000	people	marched	in	the	streets	of	edinburgh	outside	this	very	building	for	make	poverty	history	.
all	together	,	they	achieved	these	results	:	increased	the	number	of	people	on	anti	-	retrovirals	,	life	-	saving	anti	-	aids	drugs	;	nearly	halved	deaths	from	malaria	;	vaccinated	so	many	that	5.4	million	lives	will	be	saved	.
and	combined	,	this	is	going	to	result	in	two	million	fewer	children	dying	every	year	,	last	year	,	than	in	the	year	2000	.
that	's	5,000	fewer	kids	dying	every	day	,	ten	times	you	lot	not	dead	every	day	,	because	of	all	of	these	partnerships	.
so	i	think	this	is	amazing	living	proof	of	progress	that	more	people	should	know	about	,	but	the	challenge	of	communicating	this	kind	of	good	news	is	probably	the	subject	of	a	different	tedtalk	.
anyway	,	for	now	,	anyone	involved	in	getting	these	results	,	thank	you	.	i	think	this	proved	these	goals	are	worth	it	.
but	there	's	still	a	lot	of	unfinished	business	.
still	,	7.6	million	children	die	every	year	of	preventable	,	treatable	diseases	,	and	178	million	kids	are	malnourished	to	the	point	of	stunting	,	a	horrible	term	which	means	physical	and	cognitive	lifelong	impairment	.
so	there	's	plainly	a	lot	more	to	do	on	the	goals	we	've	got	.
but	then	,	a	lot	of	people	think	there	are	things	that	should	have	been	in	the	original	package	that	were	n't	agreed	back	then	that	should	now	be	included	,	like	sustainable	development	targets	,	natural	resource	governance	targets	,	access	to	opportunity	,	to	knowledge	,	equity	,	fighting	corruption	.
all	of	this	is	measurable	and	could	be	in	the	new	goals	.
but	the	key	thing	here	is	,	what	do	you	think	should	be	in	the	new	goals	?
what	do	you	want	?
are	you	annoyed	that	i	did	n't	talk	about	gender	equality	or	education	?
should	those	be	in	the	new	package	of	goals	?
and	quite	frankly	,	that	's	a	good	question	,	but	there	's	going	to	be	some	tough	tradeoffs	and	choices	here	,	so	you	want	to	hope	that	the	process	by	which	the	world	decides	these	new	goals	is	going	to	be	legitimate	,	right	?
well	,	as	we	gather	here	in	edinburgh	,	technocrats	appointed	by	the	u.n.	and	certain	governments	,	with	the	best	intentions	,	are	busying	themselves	designing	a	new	package	of	goals	,	and	currently	they	're	doing	that	through	pretty	much	the	same	old	late	-	20th	-	century	,	top	-	down	,	elite	,	closed	process	.
but	,	of	course	,	since	then	,	the	web	and	mobile	telephony	,	along	with	ubiquitous	reality	tv	formats	have	spread	all	around	the	world	.
so	what	we	'd	like	to	propose	is	that	we	use	them	to	involve	people	from	all	around	the	world	in	an	historic	first	:	the	world	's	first	truly	global	poll	and	consultation	,	where	everyone	everywhere	has	an	equal	voice	for	the	very	first	time	.
i	mean	,	would	n't	it	be	a	huge	historic	missed	opportunity	not	to	do	this	,	given	that	we	can	?
there	's	hundreds	of	billions	of	your	aid	dollars	at	stake	,	tens	of	millions	of	lives	,	or	deaths	,	at	stake	,	and	,	i	'd	argue	,	the	security	and	future	of	you	and	your	family	is	also	at	stake	.
so	,	if	you	're	with	me	,	i	'd	say	there	's	three	essential	steps	in	this	crowdsourcing	campaign	:	collecting	,	connecting	and	committing	.
so	first	of	all	,	we	've	got	to	ground	this	campaign	in	core	polling	data	.
let	's	go	into	every	country	that	will	let	us	in	,	ask	1,001	people	what	they	want	the	new	goals	to	be	,	making	special	efforts	to	reach	the	poorest	,	those	without	access	to	modern	technology	,	and	let	's	make	sure	that	their	views	are	at	the	center	of	the	goals	going	forward	.
then	,	we	've	got	to	commission	a	baseline	survey	to	make	sure	we	can	monitor	and	progress	the	goals	going	forward	.	the	original	goals	did	n't	really	have	good	baseline	survey	data	,	and	we	're	going	to	need	the	help	of	big	data	through	all	of	this	process	to	make	sure	we	can	really	monitor	the	progress	.
and	then	we	've	got	to	connect	with	the	big	crowd	.
now	here	,	we	see	the	role	for	an	unprecedented	coalition	of	social	media	giants	and	upstarts	,	telecoms	companies	,	reality	tv	show	formats	,	gaming	companies	,	telecoms	,	all	of	them	together	in	kind	of	their	``	we	are	the	world	``	moment	.
could	they	come	together	and	help	the	millennium	development	goals	get	rebranded	into	the	millennial	generation	's	goals	?
and	if	just	five	percent	of	the	five	billion	plus	who	are	currently	connected	made	a	comment	,	and	that	comment	turned	into	a	commitment	,	we	could	crowdsource	a	force	of	300	million	people	around	the	world	to	help	see	these	goals	through	.
if	we	have	this	collected	data	,	and	this	connected	crowd	,	based	upon	our	experience	of	campaigning	and	getting	world	leaders	to	commit	,	i	think	world	leaders	will	commit	to	most	of	the	crowdsourced	recommendations	.
but	the	question	really	is	,	through	this	process	will	we	all	have	become	committed	?
and	if	we	are	,	are	we	ready	to	iterate	,	monitor	and	provide	feedback	,	make	sure	these	promises	are	really	delivering	results	?
well	,	there	's	some	fantastic	examples	here	to	scale	up	,	mostly	piloted	within	africa	,	actually	.
there	's	open	data	kenya	,	which	geocodes	and	crowdsources	information	about	where	projects	are	,	are	they	delivering	results	.
often	,	they	're	not	in	the	right	place	.
and	ushahidi	,	which	means	``	witness	``	in	swahili	,	which	geocodes	and	crowdsources	information	in	complex	emergencies	to	help	target	responses	.
this	is	some	of	the	most	exciting	stuff	in	development	and	democracy	,	where	citizens	on	the	edge	of	a	network	are	helping	to	force	open	the	process	to	make	sure	that	the	big	global	aid	promises	and	vague	stuff	up	at	the	top	really	delivers	for	people	at	a	grassroots	level	and	inverts	that	pyramid	.
this	openness	,	this	forcing	openness	,	is	key	,	and	if	it	was	n't	entirely	transparent	already	,	i	should	be	open	:	i	've	got	a	completely	transparent	agenda	.
long	-	term	trends	suggest	that	this	century	is	going	to	be	a	tough	place	to	live	,	with	population	increases	,	consumption	patterns	increasing	,	and	conflict	over	scarce	natural	resources	.
and	look	at	the	state	of	global	politics	today	.
look	at	the	rio	earth	summit	that	happened	just	last	week	,	or	the	mexican	g	20	,	also	last	week	.
both	,	if	we	're	honest	,	a	bust	.
our	world	leaders	,	our	global	politics	,	currently	ca	n't	get	it	done	.
they	need	our	help	.	they	need	the	cavalry	,	and	the	cavalry	's	not	going	to	come	from	mars	.
it	's	got	to	come	from	us	,	and	i	see	this	process	of	deciding	democratically	in	a	bottom	-	up	fashion	what	the	world	wants	to	work	on	together	as	one	vital	means	by	which	we	can	crowdsource	the	force	to	really	build	that	constituency	that	's	going	to	reinvigorate	global	governance	in	the	21st	century	.
i	started	in	2000	.	let	me	finish	in	2030	.
many	people	made	fun	of	a	big	campaign	a	few	years	ago	we	had	called	make	poverty	history	.
it	was	a	naive	thought	in	many	people	's	minds	,	and	it	's	true	,	it	was	just	a	t	-	shirt	slogan	that	worked	for	the	moment	.	but	look	.
the	empirical	condition	of	living	under	a	dollar	and	25	is	trending	down	,	and	look	where	it	gets	to	by	2030	.
it	's	getting	near	zero	.
now	sure	,	progress	in	china	and	india	and	poverty	reduction	there	was	key	to	that	,	but	recently	also	in	africa	,	poverty	rates	are	being	reduced	.
it	will	get	harder	as	we	get	towards	zero	,	as	the	poor	will	be	increasingly	located	in	post	-	conflict	,	fragile	states	,	or	maybe	in	middle	income	states	where	they	do	n't	really	care	about	the	marginalized	.
but	i	'm	confident	,	with	the	right	kind	of	political	campaigning	and	creative	and	technological	innovation	combined	working	together	more	and	more	as	one	,	i	think	we	can	get	this	and	other	goals	done	.
thank	you	.
chris	anderson	:	jamie	,	here	's	the	puzzle	to	me	.
if	there	was	an	incident	today	where	a	hundred	kids	died	in	some	tragedy	or	where	,	say	,	a	hundred	kids	were	kidnapped	and	then	rescued	by	special	forces	,	i	mean	,	it	would	be	all	over	the	news	for	a	week	,	right	?
you	just	put	up	,	just	as	one	of	your	numbers	there	,	that	5,000	--	is	that	the	number	?
jamie	drummond	:	fewer	children	every	day	.
ca	:	five	thousand	fewer	children	dying	every	day	.
i	mean	,	it	dwarfs	,	dwarfs	everything	that	is	actually	on	our	news	agenda	,	and	it	's	invisible	.
this	must	drive	you	crazy	.
jd	:	it	does	,	and	we	're	having	a	huge	debate	in	this	country	about	aid	levels	,	for	example	,	and	aid	alone	is	not	the	whole	solution	.	nobody	thinks	it	is	.
but	,	you	know	,	if	people	saw	the	results	of	this	smart	aid	,	i	mean	,	they	'd	be	going	crazy	for	it	.
i	wish	the	250,000	people	who	really	did	march	outside	this	very	building	knew	these	results	.
right	now	they	do	n't	,	and	it	would	be	great	to	find	a	way	to	better	communicate	it	,	because	we	have	not	.
creatively	,	we	've	failed	to	communicate	this	success	so	far	.
if	those	kinds	of	efforts	just	could	multiply	their	voice	and	amplify	it	at	the	key	moments	,	i	know	for	a	fact	we	'd	get	better	policy	.
the	mexican	g	20	need	not	have	been	a	bust	.
rio	,	if	anyone	cares	about	the	environment	,	need	not	have	been	a	bust	,	okay	?
but	these	conferences	are	going	on	,	and	i	know	people	get	skeptical	and	cynical	about	the	big	global	summits	and	the	promises	and	their	never	being	kept	,	but	actually	,	the	bits	that	are	,	are	making	a	difference	,	and	what	the	politicians	need	is	more	permission	from	the	public	.
ca	:	but	you	have	n't	fully	worked	out	the	web	mechanisms	,	etc	.	by	which	this	might	happen	.
i	mean	,	if	the	people	here	who	've	had	experience	using	open	platforms	,	you	're	interested	to	talk	with	them	this	week	and	try	to	take	this	forward	.
jd	:	absolutely	.	ca	:	all	right	,	well	i	must	say	,	if	this	conference	led	in	some	way	to	advancing	that	idea	,	that	's	a	huge	idea	,	and	if	you	carry	that	forward	,	that	is	really	awesome	,	so	thank	you	.	jd	:	i	'd	love	your	help	.
ca	:	thank	you	,	thank	you	.
