over	the	past	six	months	,	i	've	spent	my	time
traveling	.	i	think	i	've	done	60,000	miles	,	but	without	leaving	my	desk	.
and	the	reason	i	can	do	that	is	because	i	'm	actually	two	people	.
i	look	like	one	person	but	i	'm	two	people	.	i	'm	eddie	who	is	here	,	and	at	the	same	time	,	my	alter	ego	is	a	big	green	boxy	avatar	nicknamed	cyber	frank	.
so	that	's	what	i	spend	my	time	doing	.	i	'd	like	to	start	,	if	it	's	possible	,	with	a	test	,	because	i	do	business	stuff	,	so	it	's	important	that	we	focus	on	outcomes	.
and	then	i	struggled	,	because	i	was	thinking	to	myself	,	``	what	should	i	talk	?	what	should	i	do	?	it	's	a	ted	audience	.
it	's	got	to	be	stretching	.	how	am	i	going	to	make	--	?	``	so	i	just	hope	i	've	got	the	level	of	difficulty	right	.
so	let	's	just	walk	our	way	through	this	.
please	could	you	work	this	through	with	me	?	you	can	shout	out	the	answer	if	you	like	.
the	question	is	,	which	of	these	horizontal	lines	is	longer	?
the	answer	is	?
audience	:	the	same	.	eddie	obeng	:	the	same	.	no	,	they	're	not	the	same	.
they	're	not	the	same	.	the	top	one	is	10	percent	longer	than	the	bottom	one	.
so	why	did	you	tell	me	they	were	the	same	?	do	you	remember	when	we	were	kids	at	school	,	about	that	big	,	they	played	the	same	trick	on	us	?
it	was	to	teach	us	parallax	.	do	you	remember	?
and	you	got	,	you	said	,	``	it	's	the	same	!	``	and	you	got	it	wrong	.
you	remember	?	and	you	learned	the	answer	,	and	you	've	carried	this	answer	in	your	head	for	10	,	20	,	30	,	40	years	:
the	answer	is	the	same	.	the	answer	is	the	same	.	so	when	you	're	asked	what	the	lengths	are	,	you	say	they	're	the	same	,	but	they	're	not	the	same	,	because	i	've	changed	it	.
and	this	is	what	i	'm	trying	to	explain	has	happened	to	us	in	the	21st	century	.
somebody	or	something	has	changed	the	rules	about	how	our	world	works	.
when	i	'm	joking	,	i	try	and	explain	it	happened	at	midnight	,	you	see	,	while	we	were	asleep	,	but	it	was	midnight	15	years	ago	.	okay	?
you	did	n't	notice	it	?	but	basically	,	what	they	do	is	,	they	switched	all	the	rules	round	,	so	that	the	way	to	successfully	run	a	business	,	an	organization	,	or	even	a	country	,	has	been	deleted	,	flipped	,	and	it	's	a	completely	new	--	you	think	i	'm	joking	,	do	n't	you	--	there	's	a	completely	new	set	of	rules	in	operation	.
did	you	notice	that	?	i	mean	,	you	missed	this	one	.
you	probably	--	no	,	you	did	n't	.	okay	.
my	simple	idea	is	that	what	's	happened	is	,	the	real	21st	century	around	us	is	n't	so	obvious	to	us	,	so	instead	we	spend	our	time	responding	rationally	to	a	world	which	we	understand	and	recognize	,	but	which	no	longer	exists	.
you	do	n't	believe	me	,	do	you	?	okay	.
so	let	me	take	you	on	a	little	journey	of	many	of	the	things	i	do	n't	understand	.
if	you	search	amazon	for	the	word	``	creativity	,	``	you	'll	discover	something	like	90,000	books	.
if	you	go	on	google	and	you	look	for	``	innovation	+	creativity	,	``	you	get	30	million	hits	.	if	you	add	the	word	``	consultants	,	``	it	doubles	to	60	million	.
are	you	with	me	?	and	yet	,	statistically	,	what	you	discover	is	that	about	one	in	100,000	ideas	is	found	making	money	or	delivering	benefits	two	years	after	its	inception	.
it	makes	no	sense	.	companies	make	their	expensive	executives	spend	ages	carefully	preparing	forecasts	and	budgets	which	are	obsolete	or	need	changing	before	they	can	be	published	.
how	is	that	possible	?	if	you	look	at	the	visions	we	have	,	the	visions	of	how	we	're	going	to	change	the	world	,	the	key	thing	is	implementation	.	we	have	the	vision	.
we	've	got	to	make	it	happen	.
we	've	spent	decades	professionalizing	implementation	.
people	are	supposed	to	be	good	at	making	stuff	happen	.
however	,	if	i	use	as	an	example	a	family	of	five	going	on	holiday	,	if	you	can	imagine	this	,	all	the	way	from	london	all	the	way	across	to	hong	kong	,	what	i	want	you	to	think	about	is	their	budget	is	only	3,000	pounds	of	expenses	.
what	actually	happens	is	,	if	i	compare	this	to	the	average	real	project	,	average	real	successful	project	,	the	family	actually	end	up	in	makassar	,	south	sulawesi	,	at	a	cost	of	4,000	pounds	,	whilst	leaving	two	of	the	children	behind	.
what	i	'm	trying	to	explain	to	you	is	,	there	are	things	which	do	n't	make	sense	to	us	.
it	gets	even	worse	than	that	.	let	me	just	walk	you	through	this	one	.
this	is	a	quote	,	and	i	'll	just	pick	words	out	of	it	.
it	says	--	i	'll	put	on	the	voice	--	``	in	summary	,	your	majesty	,	the	failure	to	foresee	the	timing	,	extent	and	severity	of	the	crisis	was	due	to	the	lack	of	creativity	and	the	number	of	bright	minds	,	``	or	something	like	that	.
this	was	a	group	of	eminent	economists	apologizing	to	the	queen	of	england	when	she	asked	the	question	,	``	why	did	no	one	tell	us	that	the	crisis	was	coming	?	``	i	'll	never	get	my	knighthood	.	i	'll	never	get	my	knighthood	.
that	's	not	the	important	point	.	the	thing	you	have	to	remember	is	,	these	are	eminent	economists	,	some	of	the	smartest	people	on	the	planet	.	do	you	see	the	challenge	?
it	's	scary	.	my	friend	and	mentor	,	tim	brown	of	ideo	,	he	explains	that	design	must	get	big	,	and	he	's	right	.
he	wisely	explains	this	to	us	.	he	says	design	thinking	must	tackle	big	systems	for	the	challenges	we	have	.
he	's	absolutely	right	.
and	then	i	ask	myself	,	``	why	was	it	ever	small	?	``	is	n't	it	weird	?	you	know	,	if	collaboration	is	so	cool	,	is	cross	-	functional	working	is	so	amazing	,	why	did	we	build	these	huge	hierarchies	?	what	's	going	on	?
you	see	,	i	think	what	's	happened	,	perhaps	,	is	that	we	've	not	noticed	that	change	i	described	earlier	.
what	we	do	know	is	that	the	world	has	accelerated	.
cyberspace	moves	everything	at	the	speed	of	light	.
technology	accelerates	things	exponentially	.
so	if	this	is	now	,	and	that	's	the	past	,	and	we	start	thinking	about	change	,	you	know	,	all	governments	are	seeking	change	,	you	're	here	seeking	change	,	everybody	's	after	change	,	it	's	really	cool	.
so	what	happens	is	,	we	get	this	wonderful	whooshing	acceleration	and	change	.
the	speed	is	accelerating	.	that	's	not	the	only	thing	.
at	the	same	time	,	as	we	've	done	that	,	we	've	done	something	really	weird	.
we	've	doubled	the	population	in	40	years	,	put	half	of	them	in	cities	,	then	connected	them	all	up	so	they	can	interact	.
the	density	of	the	interaction	of	human	beings	is	amazing	.
there	are	charts	which	show	all	these	movements	of	information	.	that	density	of	information	is	amazing	.
and	then	we	've	done	a	third	thing	.
you	know	,	for	those	of	you	who	have	as	an	office	a	little	desk	underneath	the	stairs	,	and	you	say	,	well	this	is	my	little	desk	under	the	stairs	,	no	!	you	are	sitting	at	the	headquarters	of	a	global	corporation	if	you	're	connected	to	the	internet	.
what	's	happened	is	,	we	've	changed	the	scale	.
size	and	scale	are	no	longer	the	same	.
and	then	add	to	that	,	every	time	you	tweet	,	over	a	third	of	your	followers	follow	from	a	country	which	is	not	your	own	.
global	is	the	new	scale	.	we	know	that	.
and	so	people	say	things	like	,	``	the	world	is	now	a	turbulent	place	.	``	have	you	heard	them	saying	things	like	that	?
and	they	use	it	as	a	metaphor	.	have	you	come	across	this	?
and	they	think	it	's	a	metaphor	,	but	this	is	not	a	metaphor	.
it	's	reality	.	as	a	young	engineering	student	,	i	remember	going	to	a	demonstration	where	they	basically	,	the	demonstrator	did	something	quite	intriguing	.
what	he	did	was	,	he	got	a	transparent	pipe	--	have	you	seen	this	demonstration	before	?	--	he	attached	it	to	a	tap	.	so	effectively	what	you	had	was	,	you	had	a	situation	where	--	i	'll	try	and	draw	the	tap	and	the	pipe	,	actually	i	'll	skip	the	tap	.	the	taps	are	hard	.
okay	?	so	i	'll	write	the	word	``	tap	.	``	is	that	okay	?	it	's	a	tap	.
okay	,	so	he	attaches	it	to	a	transparent	pipe	,	and	he	turns	the	water	on	.
and	he	says	,	do	you	notice	anything	?	and	the	water	is	whooshing	down	this	pipe	.
i	mean	,	this	is	not	exciting	stuff	.	are	you	with	me	?
so	the	water	goes	up	.	he	turns	it	back	down	.	great	.
and	he	says	,	``	anything	you	notice	?	``	no	.	then	he	sticks	a	needle	into	the	pipe	,	and	he	connects	this	to	a	container	,	and	he	fills	the	container	up	with	green	ink	.	you	with	me	?
so	guess	what	happens	?	a	thin	green	line	comes	out	as	it	flows	down	the	pipe	.	it	's	not	that	interesting	.
and	then	he	turns	the	water	up	a	bit	,	so	it	starts	coming	back	in	.	and	nothing	changes	.
so	he	's	changing	the	flow	of	the	water	,	but	it	's	just	a	boring	green	line	.
he	adds	some	more	.	he	adds	some	more	.	and	then	something	weird	happens	.
there	's	this	little	flicker	,	and	then	as	he	turns	it	ever	so	slightly	more	,	the	whole	of	that	green	line	disappears	,	and	instead	there	are	these	little	sort	of	inky	dust	devils	close	to	the	needle	.
they	're	called	eddies	.	not	me	.	and	they	're	violently	dispersing	the	ink	so	that	it	actually	gets	diluted	out	,	and	the	color	's	gone	.
what	's	happened	in	this	world	of	pipe	is	somebody	has	flipped	it	.	they	've	changed	the	rules	from	laminar	to	turbulent	.
all	the	rules	are	gone	.	in	that	environment	,	instantly	,	all	the	possibilities	which	turbulence	brings	are	available	,	and	it	's	not	the	same	as	laminar	.
and	if	we	did	n't	have	that	green	ink	,	you	'd	never	notice	.
and	i	think	this	is	our	challenge	,	because	somebody	has	actually	increased	--	and	it	's	probably	you	guys	with	all	your	tech	and	stuff	--	the	speed	,	the	scale	and	the	density	of	interaction	.
now	how	do	we	cope	and	deal	with	that	?
well	,	we	could	just	call	it	turbulence	,	or	we	could	try	and	learn	.
yes	,	learn	,	but	i	know	you	guys	grew	up	in	the	days	when	there	were	actually	these	things	called	correct	answers	,	because	of	the	answer	you	gave	me	to	the	horizontal	line	puzzle	,	and	you	believe	it	will	last	forever	.
so	i	'll	put	a	little	line	up	here	which	represents	learning	,	and	that	's	how	we	used	to	do	it	.	we	could	see	things	,	understand	them	,	take	the	time	to	put	them	into	practice	.
out	here	is	the	world	.	now	,	what	's	happened	to	our	pace
of	learning	as	the	world	has	accelerated	?	well	,	if	you	work	for	a	corporation	,	you	'll	discover	it	's	quite	difficult	to	work	on	stuff	which	your	boss	does	n't	approve	of	,	is	n't	in	the	strategy	,	and	anyway	,	you	've	got	to	go	through	your	monthly	meetings	.
if	you	work	in	an	institution	,	one	day	you	will	get	them	to	make	that	decision	.
and	if	you	work	in	a	market	where	people	believe	in	cycles	,	it	's	even	funnier	,	because	you	have	to	wait	all	the	way	for	the	cycle	to	fail	before	you	go	,	``	there	's	something	wrong	.	``	you	with	me	?
so	it	's	likely	that	the	line	,	in	terms	of	learning	,	is	pretty	flat	.
you	with	me	?	this	point	over	here	,	the	point	at	which	the	lines	cross	over	,	the	pace	of	change	overtakes	the	pace	of	learning	,	and	for	me	,	that	is	what	i	was	describing	when	i	was	telling	you	about	midnight	.
so	what	does	it	do	to	us	?	well	,	it	completely	transforms	what	we	have	to	do	,	many	mistakes	we	make	.	we	solve	last	year	's	problems	without	thinking	about	the	future	.	if	you	try	and	think	about	it	,	the	things	you	're	solving	now	,	what	problems	are	they	going	to	bring	in	the	future	?
if	you	have	n't	understood	the	world	you	're	living	in	,	it	's	almost	impossible	to	be	absolutely	certain	that	what	you	're	going	to	deliver	fits	.
i	'll	give	you	an	example	,	a	quick	one	.	creativity	and	ideas	,	i	mentioned	that	earlier	.	all	the	ceos	around	me	,	my	clients	,	they	want	innovation	,	so	they	seek	innovation	.	they	say	to	people	,	``	take	risks	and	be	creative	!	``	but	unfortunately	the	words	get	transformed	as	they	travel	through	the	air	.
entering	their	ears	,	what	they	hear	is	,	``	do	crazy	things	and	then	i	'll	fire	you	.	``	why	?	because	--
why	?	because	in	the	old	world	,	okay	,	in	the	old	world	,	over	here	,	getting	stuff	wrong	was	unacceptable	.
if	you	got	something	wrong	,	you	'd	failed	.	how	should	you	be	treated	?
well	,	harshly	,	because	you	could	have	asked	somebody	who	had	experience	.
so	we	learned	the	answer	and	we	carried	this	in	our	heads	for	20	,	30	years	,	are	you	with	me	?
the	answer	is	,	do	n't	do	things	which	are	different	.
and	then	suddenly	we	tell	them	to	and	it	does	n't	work	.
you	see	,	in	reality	,	there	are	two	ways	you	can	fail	in	our	new	world	.
one	,	you	're	doing	something	that	you	should	follow	a	procedure	to	,	and	it	's	a	very	difficult	thing	,	you	're	sloppy	,	you	get	it	wrong	.	how	should	you	be	treated	?	you	should	probably	be	fired	.
on	the	other	hand	,	you	're	doing	something	new	,	no	one	's	ever	done	before	,	you	get	it	completely	wrong	.	how	should	you	be	treated	?
well	,	free	pizzas	!	you	should	be	treated	better	than	the	people	who	succeed	.
it	's	called	smart	failure	.	why	?	because	you	ca	n't	put	it	on	your	c.v	.
so	what	i	want	to	leave	you	,	then	,	is	with	the	explanation	of	why	i	actually	traveled	60,000	miles	from	my	desk	.
when	i	realized	the	power	of	this	new	world	,	i	quit	my	safe	teaching	job	,	and	set	up	a	virtual	business	school	,	the	first	in	the	world	,	in	order	to	teach	people	how	to	make	this	happen	,	and	i	used	some	of	my	learnings	about	some	of	the	rules	which	i	'd	learned	on	myself	.
if	you	're	interested	,	worldaftermidnight.com	,	you	'll	find	out	more	,	but	i	've	applied	them	to	myself	for	over	a	decade	,	and	i	'm	still	here	,	and	i	still	have	my	house	,	and	the	most	important	thing	is	,	i	hope	i	've	done	enough	to	inject	a	little	green	ink	into	your	lives	,	so	that	when	you	go	away	and	you	're	making	your	next	absolutely	sensible	and	rational	decision	,	you	'll	take	some	time	to	think	,	``	hmm	,	i	wonder	whether	this	also	makes	sense	in	our	new	world	after	midnight	.	``	thank	you	very	much	.
thank	you	,	thank	you	.
