good	morning	.	so	magic	is	an	excellent	way	for	staying	ahead	of	the	reality	curve	,	to	make	possible	today	what	science	will	make	a	reality	tomorrow	.
as	a	cyber	-	magician	,	i	combine	elements	of	illusion	and	science	to	give	us	a	feel	of	how	future	technologies	might	be	experienced	.
you	've	probably	all	heard	of	google	's	project	glass	.
it	's	new	technology	.	you	look	through	them	and	the	world	you	see	is	augmented	with	data	:	names	of	places	,	monuments	,	buildings	,	maybe	one	day	even	the	names	of	the	strangers	that	pass	you	on	the	street	.
so	these	are	my	illusion	glasses	.
they	're	a	little	bigger	.	they	're	a	prototype	.
and	when	you	look	through	them	,	you	get	a	glimpse	into	the	mind	of	the	cyber	-	illusionist	.
let	me	show	you	what	i	mean	.
all	we	need	is	a	playing	card	.	any	card	will	do	.
like	this	.	and	let	me	mark	it	so	we	can	recognize	it	when	we	see	it	again	.
all	right	.	very	significant	mark	.
and	let	's	put	it	back	into	the	deck	,	somewhere	in	the	middle	,	and	let	's	get	started	.
voice	:	system	ready	.	acquiring	image	.
marco	tempest	:	for	those	of	you	who	do	n't	play	cards	,	a	deck	of	cards	is	made	up	of	four	different	suits	:	hearts	,	clubs	,	diamonds	and	spades	.
the	cards	are	amongst	the	oldest	of	symbols	,	and	have	been	interpreted	in	many	different	ways	.
now	,	some	say	that	the	four	suits	represent	the	four	seasons	.
there	's	spring	,	summer	,	autumn	and	â		
voice	:	my	favorite	season	is	winter	.	mt	:	well	yeah	,	mine	too	.
winter	is	like	magic	.	it	's	a	time	of	change	,	when	warmth	turns	to	cold	,	water	turns	to	snow	,	and	then	it	all	disappears	.
there	are	13	cards	in	each	suit	.
voice	:	each	card	represents	a	phase	of	the	13	lunar	cycles	.
mt	:	so	over	here	is	low	tide	,	and	over	here	is	high	tide	,	and	in	the	middle	is	the	moon	.
voice	:	the	moon	is	one	of	the	most	potent	symbols	of	magic	.
mt	:	there	are	two	colors	in	a	deck	of	cards	.
there	is	the	color	red	and	the	color	black	,	representing	the	constant	change	from	day	to	night	.
voice	:	marco	,	i	did	not	know	you	could	do	that	.
mt	:	and	is	it	a	coincidence	that	there	are	52	cards	in	a	deck	of	cards	,	just	as	there	are	52	weeks	in	a	year	?
voice	:	if	you	total	all	the	spots	on	a	deck	of	cards	,	the	result	is	365	.
mt	:	oh	,	365	,	the	number	of	days	in	a	year	,	the	number	of	days	between	each	birthday	.
make	a	wish	.
voice	:	do	n't	tell	,	or	it	wo	n't	come	true	.
mt	:	well	,	as	a	matter	of	fact	,	it	was	on	my	sixth	birthday	that	i	received	my	first	deck	of	cards	,	and	ever	since	that	day	,	i	have	traveled	around	the	world	performing	magic	for	boys	and	girls	,	men	and	women	,	husbands	and	wives	,	even	kings	and	queens	.
voice	:	and	who	are	these	?	mt	:	ah	,	mischief	-	makers	.	watch	.
wake	up	.
joker	:	whoa	.	mt	:	are	you	ready	for	your	party	piece	?
joker	:	ready	!	mt	:	let	me	see	what	you	've	got	.
joker	:	presenting	my	pogo	stick	.	mt	:	ah	.	watch	out	.
joker	:	whoa	,	whoa	,	whoa	,	oh	!
mt	:	but	today	,	i	am	performing	for	a	different	kind	of	audience	.
i	'm	performing	for	you	.
voice	:	signed	card	detected	.	mt	:	well	,	sometimes	people	ask	me	how	do	you	become	a	magician	?	is	it	a	9	-	to	-	5	job	?
of	course	not	!	you	've	got	to	practice	24/7	.
i	do	n't	literally	mean	24	hours	,	seven	days	a	week	.
24/7	is	a	little	bit	of	an	exaggeration	,	but	it	does	take	practice	.	now	,	some	people	will	say	,	well	,	magic	,	that	must	be	the	work	of	some	evil	supernatural	force	.
whoa	.
well	,	to	this	,	i	just	say	,	no	no	.
actually	,	in	german	,	it	's	nein	nein	.
magic	is	n't	that	intense	.	i	have	to	warn	you	,	though	,
if	you	ever	play	with	someone	who	deals	cards	like	this	,	do	n't	play	for	money	.
voice	:	why	not	?	that	's	a	very	good	hand	.
the	odds	of	getting	it	are	4,165	to	one	.
mt	:	yeah	,	but	i	guess	my	hand	is	better	.	we	beat	the	odds	.
voice	:	i	think	you	got	your	birthday	wish	.	mt	:	and	that	actually	leaves	me	with	the	last	,	and	most	important	card	of	all	:	the	one	with	this	very	significant	mark	on	it	.
and	unlike	anything	else	we	've	just	seen	,	virtual	or	not	.	voice	:	signed	card	detected	.
digital	mt	:	this	is	without	a	question	the	real	thing	.
mt	:	bye	bye	.
thank	you	.
thank	you	very	much	.
