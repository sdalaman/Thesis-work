beau	lotto	:	so	,	this	game	is	very	simple	.
all	you	have	to	do	is	read	what	you	see	.	right	?
so	,	i	'm	going	to	count	to	you	,	so	we	do	n't	all	do	it	together	.
okay	,	one	,	two	,	three	.	audience	:	can	you	read	this	?
bl	:	amazing	.	what	about	this	one	?	one	,	two	,	three	.	audience	:	you	are	not	reading	this	.
bl	:	all	right	.	one	,	two	,	three	.
if	you	were	portuguese	,	right	?	how	about	this	one	?	one	,	two	,	three	.
audience	:	what	are	you	reading	?
bl	:	what	are	you	reading	?	there	are	no	words	there	.
i	said	,	read	what	you	're	seeing	.	right	?
it	literally	says	,	``	wat	ar	ou	rea	in	?	``	right	?
that	's	what	you	should	have	said	.	right	?	why	is	this	?
it	's	because	perception	is	grounded	in	our	experience	.
right	?	the	brain	takes	meaningless	information	and	makes	meaning	out	of	it	,	which	means	we	never	see	what	's	there	,	we	never	see	information	,	we	only	ever	see	what	was	useful	to	see	in	the	past	.
all	right	?	which	means	,	when	it	comes	to	perception	,	we	're	all	like	this	frog	.
right	?	it	's	getting	information	.	it	's	generating	behavior	that	's	useful	.
man	:	ow	!	ow	!
bl	:	and	sometimes	,	when	things	do	n't	go	our	way	,	we	get	a	little	bit	annoyed	,	right	?
but	we	're	talking	about	perception	here	,	right	?
and	perception	underpins	everything	we	think	,	we	know	,	we	believe	,	our	hopes	,	our	dreams	,	the	clothes	we	wear	,	falling	in	love	,	everything	begins	with	perception	.
now	if	perception	is	grounded	in	our	history	,	it	means	we	're	only	ever	responding	according	to	what	we	've	done	before	.
but	actually	,	it	's	a	tremendous	problem	,	because	how	can	we	ever	see	differently	?
now	,	i	want	to	tell	you	a	story	about	seeing	differently	,	and	all	new	perceptions	begin	in	the	same	way	.
they	begin	with	a	question	.
the	problem	with	questions	is	they	create	uncertainty	.
now	,	uncertainty	is	a	very	bad	thing	.	it	's	evolutionarily	a	bad	thing	.	if	you	're	not	sure	that	's	a	predator	,	it	's	too	late	.
okay	?
even	seasickness	is	a	consequence	of	uncertainty	.	right	?	if	you	go	down	below	on	a	boat	,	your	inner	ears	are	you	telling	you	you	're	moving	.	your	eyes	,	because	it	's	moving	in	register	with	the	boat	,	say	i	'm	standing	still	.
your	brain	can	not	deal	with	the	uncertainty	of	that	information	,	and	it	gets	ill	.
the	question	``	why	?	``	is	one	of	the	most	dangerous	things	you	can	do	,	because	it	takes	you	into	uncertainty	.
and	yet	,	the	irony	is	,	the	only	way	we	can	ever	do	anything	new	is	to	step	into	that	space	.
so	how	can	we	ever	do	anything	new	?	well	fortunately	,	evolution	has	given	us	an	answer	,	right	?
and	it	enables	us	to	address	even	the	most	difficult	they	're	the	ones	that	question	the	things	we	think	to	be	true	already	.	right	?
it	's	easy	to	ask	questions	about	how	did	life	begin	,	or	what	extends	beyond	the	universe	,	but	to	question	what	you	think	to	be	true	already	is	really	stepping	into	that	space	.
so	what	is	evolution	's	answer	to	the	problem	of	uncertainty	?
it	's	play	.
now	play	is	not	simply	a	process	.	experts	in	play	will	tell	you	that	actually	it	's	a	way	of	being	.
play	is	one	of	the	only	human	endeavors	where	uncertainty	is	actually	celebrated	.	uncertainty	is	what	makes	play	fun	.
right	?	it	's	adaptable	to	change	.	right	?	it	opens	possibility	,	and	it	's	cooperative	.	it	's	actually	how	we	do	our	social	bonding	,	and	it	's	intrinsically	motivated	.	what	that	means	is	that	we	play	to	play	.	play	is	its	own	reward	.
now	if	you	look	at	these	five	ways	of	being	,	these	are	the	exact	same	ways	of	being	you	need	in	order	to	be	a	good	scientist	.
science	is	not	defined	by	the	method	section	of	a	paper	.
it	's	actually	a	way	of	being	,	which	is	here	,	and	this	is	true	for	anything	that	is	creative	.
so	if	you	add	rules	to	play	,	you	have	a	game	.
that	's	actually	what	an	experiment	is	.
so	armed	with	these	two	ideas	,	that	science	is	a	way	of	being	and	experiments	are	play	,	we	asked	,	can	anyone	become	a	scientist	?
and	who	better	to	ask	than	25	eight	-	to	10	-	year	-	old	children	?
because	they	're	experts	in	play	.	so	i	took	my	bee	arena	down	to	a	small	school	in	devon	,	and	the	aim	of	this	was	to	not	just	get	the	kids	to	see	science	differently	,	but	,	through	the	process	of	science	,	to	see	themselves	differently	.	right	?
the	first	step	was	to	ask	a	question	.
now	,	i	should	say	that	we	did	n't	get	funding	for	this	study	because	the	scientists	said	small	children	could	n't	make	a	useful	contribution	to	science	,	and	the	teachers	said	kids	could	n't	do	it	.
so	we	did	it	anyway	.	right	?	of	course	.
so	,	here	are	some	of	the	questions	.	i	put	them	in	small	print	so	you	would	n't	bother	reading	it	.	point	is	that	five	of	the	questions	that	the	kids	came	up	with	were	actually	the	basis	of	science	publication	the	last	five	to	15	years	.	right	?
so	they	were	asking	questions	that	were	significant	to	expert	scientists	.
now	here	,	i	want	to	share	the	stage	with	someone	quite	special	.	right	?
she	was	one	of	the	young	people	who	was	involved	in	this	study	,	and	she	's	now	one	of	the	youngest	published	scientists	in	the	world	.	right	?	she	will	now	,	once	she	comes	onto	stage	,	will	be	the	youngest	person	to	ever	speak	at	ted	.	right	?
now	,	science	and	asking	questions	is	about	courage	.
now	she	is	the	personification	of	courage	,	because	she	's	going	to	stand	up	here	and	talk	to	you	all	.
so	amy	,	would	you	please	come	up	?
so	amy	's	going	to	help	me	tell	the	story	of	what	we	call	the	blackawton	bees	project	,	and	first	she	's	going	to	tell	you	the	question	that	they	came	up	with	.	so	go	ahead	,	amy	.
amy	o'toole	:	thank	you	,	beau	.	we	thought	that	it	was	easy	to	see	the	link	between	humans	and	apes	in	the	way	that	we	think	,	because	we	look	alike	.
but	we	wondered	if	there	's	a	possible	link	with	other	animals	.	it	'd	be	amazing	if	humans	and	bees	thought	similar	,	since	they	seem	so	different	from	us	.
so	we	asked	if	humans	and	bees	might	solve	complex	problems	in	the	same	way	.
really	,	we	wanted	to	know	if	bees	can	also	adapt	themselves	to	new	situations	using	previously	learned	rules	and	conditions	.	so	what	if	bees	can	think	like	us	?
well	,	it	'd	be	amazing	,	since	we	're	talking	about	an	insect	with	only	one	million	brain	cells	.
but	it	actually	makes	a	lot	of	sense	they	should	,	because	bees	,	like	us	,	can	recognize	a	good	flower	regardless	of	the	time	of	day	,	the	light	,	the	weather	,	or	from	any	angle	they	approach	it	from	.
bl	:	so	the	next	step	was	to	design	an	experiment	,	which	is	a	game	.	so	the	kids	went	off	and	they	designed	this	experiment	,	and	so	--	well	,	game	--	and	so	,	amy	,	can	you	tell	us	what	the	game	was	,	and	the	puzzle	that	you	set	the	bees	?
ao	:	the	puzzle	we	came	up	with	was	an	if	-	then	rule	.
we	asked	the	bees	to	learn	not	just	to	go	to	a	certain	color	,	but	to	a	certain	color	flower	only	when	it	's	in	a	certain	pattern	.
they	were	only	rewarded	if	they	went	to	the	yellow	flowers	if	the	yellow	flowers	were	surrounded	by	the	blue	,	or	if	the	blue	flowers	were	surrounded	by	the	yellow	.
now	there	's	a	number	of	different	rules	the	bees	can	learn	to	solve	this	puzzle	.	the	interesting	question	is	,	which	?
what	was	really	exciting	about	this	project	was	we	,	and	beau	,	had	no	idea	whether	it	would	work	.
it	was	completely	new	,	and	no	one	had	done	it	before	,	including	adults	.
bl	:	including	the	teachers	,	and	that	was	really	hard	for	the	teachers	.
it	's	easy	for	a	scientist	to	go	in	and	not	have	a	clue	what	he	's	doing	,	because	that	's	what	we	do	in	the	lab	,	but	for	a	teacher	not	to	know	what	's	going	to	happen	at	the	end	of	the	day	--	so	much	of	the	credit	goes	to	dave	strudwick	,	who	was	the	collaborator	on	this	project	.	okay	?
so	i	'm	not	going	to	go	through	the	whole	details	of	the	study	because	actually	you	can	read	about	it	,	but	the	next	step	is	observation	.	so	here	are	some	of	the	students	doing	the	observations	.	they	're	recording	the	data	of	where	the	bees	fly	.
dave	strudwick	:	so	what	we	're	going	to	do	--	student	:	5c	.
dave	strudwick	:	is	she	still	going	up	here	?	student	:	yeah	.
dave	strudwick	:	so	you	keep	track	of	each	.	student	:	henry	,	can	you	help	me	here	?
bl	:	``	can	you	help	me	,	henry	?	``	what	good	scientist	says	that	,	right	?
student	:	there	's	two	up	there	.
and	three	in	here	.
bl	:	right	?	so	we	've	got	our	observations	.	we	've	got	our	data	.
they	do	the	simple	mathematics	,	averaging	,	etc	.	,	etc	.
and	now	we	want	to	share	.	that	's	the	next	step	.
so	we	're	going	to	write	this	up	and	try	to	submit	this
for	publication	.	right	?	so	we	have	to	write	it	up	.
so	we	go	,	of	course	,	to	the	pub	.	all	right	?
the	one	on	the	left	is	mine	,	okay	?
now	,	i	tell	them	,	a	paper	has	four	different	sections	:	an	introduction	,	a	methods	,	a	results	,	a	discussion	.
the	introduction	says	,	what	's	the	question	and	why	?
methods	,	what	did	you	do	?	results	,	what	was	the	observation	?
and	the	discussion	is	,	who	cares	?	right	?
that	's	a	science	paper	,	basically	.
so	the	kids	give	me	the	words	,	right	?	i	put	it	into	a	narrative	,	which	means	that	this	paper	is	written	in	kidspeak	.
it	's	not	written	by	me	.	it	's	written	by	amy	and	the	other	students	in	the	class	.	as	a	consequence	,	this	science	paper	begins	,	``	once	upon	a	time	...	``	the	results	section	,	it	says	:	``	training	phase	,	the	puzzle	...	duh	duh	duuuuuhhh	.	``	right	?
and	the	methods	,	it	says	,	``	then	we	put	the	bees	into	the	fridge	,	``	smiley	face	.	right	?
this	is	a	science	paper	.	we	're	going	to	try	to	get	it	published	.
so	here	's	the	title	page	.	we	have	a	number	of	authors	there	.
all	the	ones	in	bold	are	eight	to	10	years	old	.
the	first	author	is	blackawton	primary	school	,	because	if	it	were	ever	referenced	,	it	would	be	``	blackawton	et	al	,	``	and	not	one	individual	.	so	we	submit	it	to	a	public	access	journal	,	and	it	says	this	.	it	said	many	things	,	but	it	said	this	.
``	i	'm	afraid	the	paper	fails	our	initial	quality	control	checks	in	several	different	ways	.	``	in	other	words	,	it	starts	off	``	once	upon	a	time	,	``	the	figures	are	in	crayon	,	etc	.
so	we	said	,	we	'll	get	it	reviewed	.	so	i	sent	it	to	dale	purves	,	who	is	at	the	national	academy	of	science	,	one	of	the	leading	neuroscientists	in	the	world	,	and	he	says	,	``	this	is	the	most	original	science	paper	i	have	ever	read	``	--	--	``	and	it	certainly	deserves	wide	exposure	.	``	larry	maloney	,	expert	in	vision	,	says	,	``	the	paper	is	magnificent	.
the	work	would	be	publishable	if	done	by	adults	.	``	so	what	did	we	do	?	we	send	it	back	to	the	editor	.
they	say	no	.
so	we	asked	larry	and	natalie	hempel	to	write	a	commentary	situating	the	findings	for	scientists	,	right	,	putting	in	the	references	,	and	we	submit	it	to	biology	letters	.
and	there	,	it	was	reviewed	by	five	independent	referees	,	and	it	was	published	.	okay	?
it	took	four	months	to	do	the	science	,	two	years	to	get	it	published	.
typical	science	,	actually	,	right	?	so	this	makes	amy	and	her	friends	the	youngest	published	scientists	in	the	world	.
what	was	the	feedback	like	?
well	,	it	was	published	two	days	before	christmas	,	downloaded	30,000	times	in	the	first	day	,	right	?
it	was	the	editors	'	choice	in	science	,	which	is	a	top	science	magazine	.
it	's	forever	freely	accessible	by	biology	letters	.
it	's	the	only	paper	that	will	ever	be	freely	accessible	by	this	journal	.
last	year	,	it	was	the	second	-	most	downloaded	paper	by	biology	letters	,	and	the	feedback	from	not	just	scientists	and	teachers	but	the	public	as	well	.
and	i	'll	just	read	one	.
``	i	have	read	'	blackawton	bees	'	recently	.	i	do	n't	have	words	to	explain	exactly	how	i	am	feeling	right	now	.
what	you	guys	have	done	is	real	,	true	and	amazing	.
curiosity	,	interest	,	innocence	and	zeal	are	the	most	basic	and	most	important	things	to	do	science	.
who	else	can	have	these	qualities	more	than	children	?
please	congratulate	your	children	's	team	from	my	side	.	``	so	i	'd	like	to	conclude	with	a	physical	metaphor	.
can	i	do	it	on	you	?
oh	yeah	,	yeah	,	yeah	,	come	on	.	yeah	yeah	.	okay	.
now	,	science	is	about	taking	risks	,	so	this	is	an	incredible	risk	,	right	?
for	me	,	not	for	him	.	right	?	because	we	've	only	done	this	once	before	.
and	you	like	technology	,	right	?
shimon	schocken	:	right	,	but	i	like	myself	.
bl	:	this	is	the	epitome	of	technology	.	right	.	okay	.
now	...
okay	.
now	,	we	're	going	to	do	a	little	demonstration	,	right	?
you	have	to	close	your	eyes	,	and	you	have	to	point	where	you	hear	me	clapping	.	all	right	?
okay	,	how	about	if	everyone	over	there	shouts	.	one	,	two	,	three	?
audience	:	brilliant	.	now	,	open	your	eyes	.	we	'll	do	it	one	more	time	.
everyone	over	there	shout	.
where	's	the	sound	coming	from	?
thank	you	very	much	.
what	's	the	point	?	the	point	is	what	science	does	for	us	.
right	?	we	normally	walk	through	life	responding	,	but	if	we	ever	want	to	do	anything	different	,	we	have	to	step	into	uncertainty	.	when	he	opened	his	eyes	,	he	was	able	to	see	the	world	in	a	new	way	.
that	's	what	science	offers	us	.	it	offers	the	possibility	to	step	on	uncertainty	through	the	process	of	play	,	right	?
now	,	true	science	education	i	think	should	be	about	giving	people	a	voice	and	enabling	to	express	that	voice	,	so	i	've	asked	amy	to	be	the	last	voice	in	this	short	story	.
so	,	amy	?
ao	:	this	project	was	really	exciting	for	me	,	because	it	brought	the	process	of	discovery	to	life	,	and	it	showed	me	that	anyone	,	and	i	mean	anyone	,	has	the	potential	to	discover	something	new	,	and	that	a	small	question	can	lead	into	a	big	discovery	.
changing	the	way	a	person	thinks	about	something	can	be	easy	or	hard	.	it	all	depends	on	the	way	the	person	feels	about	change	.
but	changing	the	way	i	thought	about	science	was	surprisingly	easy	.	once	we	played	the	games	and	then	started	to	think	about	the	puzzle	,	i	then	realized	that	science	is	n't	just	a	boring	subject	,	and	that	anyone	can	discover	something	new	.
you	just	need	an	opportunity	.	my	opportunity	came	in	the	form	of	beau	,	and	the	blackawton	bee	project	.
thank	you	.	bl	:	thank	you	very	much	.
