so	i	tried	to	do	a	small	good	thing	for	my	wife	.
it	makes	me	to	stand	here	,	the	fame	,	the	money	i	got	out	of	it	.
so	what	i	did	,	i	'd	gone	back	to	my	early	marriage	days	.
what	you	did	in	the	early	marriage	days	,	you	tried	to	impress	your	wife	.	i	did	the	same	.
on	that	occasion	,	i	found	my	wife	carrying	something	like	this	.
i	saw	.	``	what	is	that	?	``	i	asked	.
my	wife	replied	,	``	none	of	your	business	.	``
then	,	being	her	husband	,	i	ran	behind	her	and	saw	she	had	a	nasty	rag	cloth	.
i	do	n't	even	use	that	cloth	to	clean	my	two	-	wheeler	.
then	i	understood	this	--	adapting	that	unhygienic	method	to	manage	her	period	days	.
then	i	immediately	asked	her	,	why	are	you	[	using	]	that	unhygienic	method	?
she	replied	,	i	also	know	about	[	sanitary	pads	]	,	but	myself	and	my	sisters	,	if	they	start	using	that	,	we	have	to	cut	our	family	milk	budget	.
then	i	was	shocked	.	what	is	the	connection	between	using	a	sanitary	pad	and	a	milk	budget	?
and	it	's	called	affordability	.
i	tried	to	impress	my	new	wife	by	offering	her	a	packet	of	sanitary	pads	.
i	went	to	a	local	shop	,	i	tried	to	buy	her	a	sanitary	pad	packet	.
that	fellow	looks	left	and	right	,	and	spreads	a	newspaper	,	rolls	it	into	the	newspaper	,	gives	it	to	me	like	a	banned	item	,	something	like	that	.
i	do	n't	know	why	.	i	did	not	ask	for	a	condom	.
then	i	took	that	pad	.	i	want	to	see	that	.	what	is	inside	it	?
the	very	first	time	,	at	the	age	of	29	,	that	day	i	am	touching	the	sanitary	pad	,	first	ever	.
i	must	know	:	how	many	of	the	guys	here	have	touched	a	sanitary	pad	?
they	are	not	going	to	touch	that	,	because	it	's	not	your	matter	.
then	i	thought	to	myself	,	white	substance	,	made	of	cotton	--
oh	my	god	,	that	guy	is	just	using	a	penny	value	of	raw	material	--	inside	they	are	selling	for	pounds	,	dollars	.
why	not	make	a	local	sanitary	pad	for	my	new	wife	?
that	's	how	all	this	started	,	but	after	making	a	sanitary	pad	,	where	can	i	check	it	?
it	's	not	like	i	can	just	check	it	in	the	lab	.
i	need	a	woman	volunteer	.	where	can	i	get	one	in	india	?
even	in	bangalore	you	wo	n't	get	[	one	]	,	in	india	.
so	only	problem	:	the	only	available	victim	is	my	wife	.
then	i	made	a	sanitary	pad	and	handed	it	to	shanti	--	my	wife	's	name	is	shanti	.
``	close	your	eyes	.	whatever	i	give	,	it	will	be	not	a	diamond	pendant	not	a	diamond	ring	,	even	a	chocolate	,	i	will	give	you	a	surprise	with	a	lot	of	tinsel	paper	rolled	up	with	it	.
close	your	eyes	.	``
because	i	tried	to	make	it	intimate	.
because	it	's	an	arranged	marriage	,	not	a	love	marriage	.
so	one	day	she	said	,	openly	,	i	'm	not	going	to	support	this	research	.
then	other	victims	,	they	got	into	my	sisters	.
but	even	sisters	,	wives	,	they	're	not	ready	to	support	in	the	research	.
that	's	why	i	am	always	jealous	with	the	saints	in	india	.
they	are	having	a	lot	of	women	volunteers	around	them	.
why	i	am	not	getting	[	any	]	?
you	know	,	without	them	even	calling	,	they	'll	get	a	lot	of	women	volunteers	.
then	i	used	,	tried	to	use	the	medical	college	girls	.
they	also	refused	.	finally	,	i	decide	,	use	sanitary	pad	myself	.
now	i	am	having	a	title	like	the	first	man	to	set	foot	on	the	moon	.
armstrong	.	then	tenzing	[	and	]	hillary	,	in	everest	,
like	that	muruganantham	is	the	first	man	wore	a	sanitary	pad	across	the	globe	.
i	wore	a	sanitary	pad	.	i	filled	animal	blood	in	a	football	bottle	,	i	tied	it	up	here	,	there	is	a	tube	going	into	my	panties	,	while	i	'm	walking	,	while	i	'm	cycling	,	i	made	a	press	,	doses	of	blood	will	go	there	.
that	makes	me	bow	down	to	any	woman	in	front	of	me	to	give	full	respect	.	that	five	days	i	'll	never	forget	--
the	messy	days	,	the	lousy	days	,	that	wetness	.
my	god	,	it	's	unbelievable	.
but	here	the	problem	is	,	one	company	is	making	napkin
out	of	cotton	.	it	is	working	well	.
but	i	am	also	trying	to	make	sanitary	pad	with	the	good	cotton	.	it	's	not	working	.
that	makes	me	to	want	to	refuse	to	continue	this	research	and	research	and	research	.
you	need	first	funds	.
not	only	financial	crises	,	but	because	of	the	sanitary	pad	research	,	i	come	through	all	sorts	of	problems	,	including	a	divorce	notice	from	my	wife	.
why	is	this	?	i	used	medical	college	girls	.
she	suspects	i	am	using	as	a	trump	card	to	run	behind	medical	college	girls	.
finally	,	i	came	to	know	it	is	a	special	cellulose	derived	from	a	pinewood	,	but	even	after	that	,	you	need	a	multimillion	-	dollar	plant	like	this	to	process	that	material	.	again	,	a	stop	-	up	.
then	i	spend	another	four	years	to	create	my	own	machine	tools	,	a	simple	machine	tool	like	this	.
in	this	machine	,	any	rural	woman	can	apply	the	same	raw	materials	that	they	are	processing	in	the	multinational	plant	,	anyone	can	make	a	world	-	class	napkin	at	your	dining	hall	.
that	is	my	invention	.
so	after	that	,	what	i	did	,	usually	if	anyone	got	a	patent	or	an	invention	,	immediately	you	want	to	make	,	convert	into	this	.
i	never	did	this	.	i	dropped	it	just	like	this	,	because	you	do	this	,	if	anyone	runs	after	money	,	their	life	will	not	[	have	]	any	beauty	.	it	is	boredom	.
a	lot	of	people	making	a	lot	of	money	,	billion	,	billions	of	dollars	accumulating	.
why	are	they	coming	for	,	finally	,	for	philanthropy	?
why	the	need	for	accumulating	money	,	then	doing	philanthropy	?
what	if	one	decided	to	start	philanthropy	from	the	day	one	?
that	's	why	i	am	giving	this	machine	only	in	rural	india	,	for	rural	women	,	because	in	india	,	[	you	'll	be	]	surprised	,	only	two	percent	of	women	are	using	sanitary	pads	.	the	rest	,	they	're	using	a	rag	cloth	,	a	leaf	,	husk	,	[	saw	]	dust	,	everything	except	sanitary	pads	.
it	is	the	same	in	the	21st	century	.	that	's	why	i	am	going	to	decide	to	give	this	machine	only	for	poor	women	across	india	.
so	far	,	630	installations	happened	in	23	states	in	six	other	countries	.
now	i	'm	on	my	seventh	year	sustaining	against	multinational	,	transnational	giants	--	makes	all	mba	students	a	question	mark	.
a	school	dropout	from	coimbatore	,	how	he	is	able	to	sustaining	?
that	makes	me	a	visiting	professor	and	guest	lecturer	in	all	iims	.	play	video	one	.
arunachalam	muruganantham	:	the	thing	i	saw	in	my	wife	's	hand	,	``	why	are	you	using	that	nasty	cloth	?	``
she	replied	immediately	,	``	i	know	about	napkins	,	but	if	i	start	using	napkins	,	then	we	have	to	cut	our	family	milk	budget	.	``
why	not	make	myself	a	low	-	cost	napkin	?
so	i	decided	i	'm	going	to	sell	this	new	machine	only	for	women	self	help	groups	.
that	is	my	idea	.
am	:	and	previously	,	you	need	a	multimillion	investment	for	machine	and	all	.	now	,	any	rural	woman	can	.
they	are	performing	puja	.
:	you	just	think	,	competing	giants	,	even	from	harvard	,	oxford	,	is	difficult	.
i	make	a	rural	woman	to	compete	with	multinationals	.
i	'm	sustaining	on	seventh	year	.
already	600	installations	.	what	is	my	mission	?
i	'm	going	to	make	india	[	into	]	a	100	-	percent	-	sanitary	-	napkin	-	using	country	in	my	lifetime	.
in	this	way	i	'm	going	to	provide	not	less	than	a	million	rural	employment	that	i	'm	going	to	create	.
that	's	why	i	'm	not	running	after	this	bloody	money	.
i	'm	doing	something	serious	.
if	you	chase	a	girl	,	the	girl	wo	n't	like	you	.
do	your	job	simply	,	the	girl	will	chase	you	.
like	that	,	i	never	chased	mahalakshmi	.
mahalakshmi	is	chasing	me	,	i	am	keeping	in	the	back	pocket	.
not	in	front	pocket	.	i	'm	a	back	pocket	man	.
that	's	all	.	a	school	dropout	saw	your	problem	in	the	society	of	not	using	sanitary	pad	.
i	am	becoming	a	solution	provider	.	i	'm	very	happy	.
i	do	n't	want	to	make	this	as	a	corporate	entity	.
i	want	to	make	this	as	a	local	sanitary	pad	movement	across	the	globe	.	that	's	why	i	put	all	the	details	on	public	domain	like	an	open	software	.
now	110	countries	are	accessing	it	.	okay	?
so	i	classify	the	people	into	three	:	uneducated	,	little	educated	,	surplus	educated	.
little	educated	,	done	this	.	surplus	educated	,	what	are	you	going	to	do	for	the	society	?
thank	you	very	much	.	bye	!
