in	oxford	in	the	1950s	,	there	was	a	fantastic	doctor	,	who	was	very	unusual	,	named	alice	stewart	.
and	alice	was	unusual	partly	because	,	of	course	,	she	was	a	woman	,	which	was	pretty	rare	in	the	1950s	.
and	she	was	brilliant	,	she	was	one	of	the	,	at	the	time	,	the	youngest	fellow	to	be	elected	to	the	royal	college	of	physicians	.
she	was	unusual	too	because	she	continued	to	work	after	she	got	married	,	after	she	had	kids	,	and	even	after	she	got	divorced	and	was	a	single	parent	,	she	continued	her	medical	work	.
and	she	was	unusual	because	she	was	really	interested	in	a	new	science	,	the	emerging	field	of	epidemiology	,	the	study	of	patterns	in	disease	.
but	like	every	scientist	,	she	appreciated	that	to	make	her	mark	,	what	she	needed	to	do	was	find	a	hard	problem	and	solve	it	.
the	hard	problem	that	alice	chose	was	the	rising	incidence	of	childhood	cancers	.
most	disease	is	correlated	with	poverty	,	but	in	the	case	of	childhood	cancers	,	the	children	who	were	dying	seemed	mostly	to	come	from	affluent	families	.
so	,	what	,	she	wanted	to	know	,	could	explain	this	anomaly	?
now	,	alice	had	trouble	getting	funding	for	her	research	.
in	the	end	,	she	got	just	1,000	pounds	from	the	lady	tata	memorial	prize	.
and	that	meant	she	knew	she	only	had	one	shot	at	collecting	her	data	.
now	,	she	had	no	idea	what	to	look	for	.
this	really	was	a	needle	in	a	haystack	sort	of	search	,	so	she	asked	everything	she	could	think	of	.
had	the	children	eaten	boiled	sweets	?
had	they	consumed	colored	drinks	?
did	they	eat	fish	and	chips	?
did	they	have	indoor	or	outdoor	plumbing	?
what	time	of	life	had	they	started	school	?
and	when	her	carbon	copied	questionnaire	started	to	come	back	,	one	thing	and	one	thing	only	jumped	out	with	the	statistical	clarity	of	a	kind	that	most	scientists	can	only	dream	of	.
the	children	who	had	died	had	had	mothers	who	had	been	x	-	rayed	when	pregnant	.
now	that	finding	flew	in	the	face	of	conventional	wisdom	.
conventional	wisdom	held	that	everything	was	safe	up	to	a	point	,	a	threshold	.
it	flew	in	the	face	of	conventional	wisdom	,	which	was	huge	enthusiasm	for	the	cool	new	technology	of	that	age	,	which	was	the	x	-	ray	machine	.
and	it	flew	in	the	face	of	doctors	'	idea	of	themselves	,	which	was	as	people	who	helped	patients	,	they	did	n't	harm	them	.
nevertheless	,	alice	stewart	rushed	to	publish	her	preliminary	findings	in	the	lancet	in	1956	.
people	got	very	excited	,	there	was	talk	of	the	nobel	prize	,	and	alice	really	was	in	a	big	hurry	to	try	to	study	all	the	cases	of	childhood	cancer	she	could	find	before	they	disappeared	.
in	fact	,	she	need	not	have	hurried	.
it	was	fully	25	years	before	the	british	and	medical	--	british	and	american	medical	establishments	abandoned	the	practice	of	x	-	raying	pregnant	women	.
the	data	was	out	there	,	it	was	open	,	it	was	freely	available	,	but	nobody	wanted	to	know	.
a	child	a	week	was	dying	,	but	nothing	changed	.
openness	alone	ca	n't	drive	change	.
so	for	25	years	alice	stewart	had	a	very	big	fight	on	her	hands	.
so	,	how	did	she	know	that	she	was	right	?
well	,	she	had	a	fantastic	model	for	thinking	.
she	worked	with	a	statistician	named	george	kneale	,	and	george	was	pretty	much	everything	that	alice	was	n't	.
so	,	alice	was	very	outgoing	and	sociable	,	and	george	was	a	recluse	.
alice	was	very	warm	,	very	empathetic	with	her	patients	.
george	frankly	preferred	numbers	to	people	.
but	he	said	this	fantastic	thing	about	their	working	relationship	.
he	said	,	``	my	job	is	to	prove	dr.	stewart	wrong	.	``	he	actively	sought	disconfirmation	.
different	ways	of	looking	at	her	models	,	at	her	statistics	,	different	ways	of	crunching	the	data	in	order	to	disprove	her	.
he	saw	his	job	as	creating	conflict	around	her	theories	.
because	it	was	only	by	not	being	able	to	prove	that	she	was	wrong	,	that	george	could	give	alice	the	confidence	she	needed	to	know	that	she	was	right	.
it	's	a	fantastic	model	of	collaboration	--	thinking	partners	who	are	n't	echo	chambers	.
i	wonder	how	many	of	us	have	,	or	dare	to	have	,	such	collaborators	.
alice	and	george	were	very	good	at	conflict	.
they	saw	it	as	thinking	.
so	what	does	that	kind	of	constructive	conflict	require	?
well	,	first	of	all	,	it	requires	that	we	find	people	who	are	very	different	from	ourselves	.
that	means	we	have	to	resist	the	neurobiological	drive	,	which	means	that	we	really	prefer	people	mostly	like	ourselves	,	and	it	means	we	have	to	seek	out	people	with	different	backgrounds	,	different	disciplines	,	different	ways	of	thinking	and	different	experience	,	and	find	ways	to	engage	with	them	.
that	requires	a	lot	of	patience	and	a	lot	of	energy	.
and	the	more	i	've	thought	about	this	,	the	more	i	think	,	really	,	that	that	's	a	kind	of	love	.
because	you	simply	wo	n't	commit	that	kind	of	energy	and	time	if	you	do	n't	really	care	.
and	it	also	means	that	we	have	to	be	prepared	to	change	our	minds	.
alice	's	daughter	told	me	that	every	time	alice	went	head	-	to	-	head	with	a	fellow	scientist	,	they	made	her	think	and	think	and	think	again	.
``	my	mother	,	``	she	said	,	``	my	mother	did	n't	enjoy	a	fight	,	but	she	was	really	good	at	them	.	``
so	it	's	one	thing	to	do	that	in	a	one	-	to	-	one	relationship	.
but	it	strikes	me	that	the	biggest	problems	we	face	,	many	of	the	biggest	disasters	that	we	've	experienced	,	mostly	have	n't	come	from	individuals	,	they	've	come	from	organizations	,	some	of	them	bigger	than	countries	,	many	of	them	capable	of	affecting	hundreds	,	thousands	,	even	millions	of	lives	.
so	how	do	organizations	think	?
well	,	for	the	most	part	,	they	do	n't	.
and	that	is	n't	because	they	do	n't	want	to	,	it	's	really	because	they	ca	n't	.
and	they	ca	n't	because	the	people	inside	of	them	are	too	afraid	of	conflict	.
in	surveys	of	european	and	american	executives	,	fully	85	percent	of	them	acknowledged	that	they	had	issues	or	concerns	at	work	that	they	were	afraid	to	raise	.
afraid	of	the	conflict	that	that	would	provoke	,	afraid	to	get	embroiled	in	arguments	that	they	did	not	know	how	to	manage	,	and	felt	that	they	were	bound	to	lose	.
eighty	-	five	percent	is	a	really	big	number	.
it	means	that	organizations	mostly	ca	n't	do	what	george	and	alice	so	triumphantly	did	.
they	ca	n't	think	together	.
and	it	means	that	people	like	many	of	us	,	who	have	run	organizations	,	and	gone	out	of	our	way	to	try	to	find	the	very	best	people	we	can	,	mostly	fail	to	get	the	best	out	of	them	.
so	how	do	we	develop	the	skills	that	we	need	?
because	it	does	take	skill	and	practice	,	too	.
if	we	are	n't	going	to	be	afraid	of	conflict	,	we	have	to	see	it	as	thinking	,	and	then	we	have	to	get	really	good	at	it	.
so	,	recently	,	i	worked	with	an	executive	named	joe	,	and	joe	worked	for	a	medical	device	company	.
and	joe	was	very	worried	about	the	device	that	he	was	working	on	.
he	thought	that	it	was	too	complicated	and	he	thought	that	its	complexity	created	margins	of	error	that	could	really	hurt	people	.
he	was	afraid	of	doing	damage	to	the	patients	he	was	trying	to	help	.
but	when	he	looked	around	his	organization	,	nobody	else	seemed	to	be	at	all	worried	.
so	,	he	did	n't	really	want	to	say	anything	.
after	all	,	maybe	they	knew	something	he	did	n't	.
maybe	he	'd	look	stupid	.
but	he	kept	worrying	about	it	,	and	he	worried	about	it	so	much	that	he	got	to	the	point	where	he	thought	the	only	thing	he	could	do	was	leave	a	job	he	loved	.
in	the	end	,	joe	and	i	found	a	way	for	him	to	raise	his	concerns	.
and	what	happened	then	is	what	almost	always	happens	in	this	situation	.
it	turned	out	everybody	had	exactly	the	same	questions	and	doubts	.
so	now	joe	had	allies	.	they	could	think	together	.
and	yes	,	there	was	a	lot	of	conflict	and	debate	and	argument	,	but	that	allowed	everyone	around	the	table	to	be	creative	,	to	solve	the	problem	,	and	to	change	the	device	.
joe	was	what	a	lot	of	people	might	think	of	as	a	whistle	-	blower	,	except	that	like	almost	all	whistle	-	blowers	,	he	was	n't	a	crank	at	all	,	he	was	passionately	devoted	to	the	organization	and	the	higher	purposes	that	that	organization	served	.
but	he	had	been	so	afraid	of	conflict	,	until	finally	he	became	more	afraid	of	the	silence	.
and	when	he	dared	to	speak	,	he	discovered	much	more	inside	himself	and	much	more	give	in	the	system	than	he	had	ever	imagined	.
and	his	colleagues	do	n't	think	of	him	as	a	crank	.
they	think	of	him	as	a	leader	.
so	,	how	do	we	have	these	conversations	more	easily	and	more	often	?
well	,	the	university	of	delft	requires	that	its	phd	students	have	to	submit	five	statements	that	they	're	prepared	to	defend	.
it	does	n't	really	matter	what	the	statements	are	about	,	what	matters	is	that	the	candidates	are	willing	and	able	to	stand	up	to	authority	.
i	think	it	's	a	fantastic	system	,	but	i	think	leaving	it	to	phd	candidates	is	far	too	few	people	,	and	way	too	late	in	life	.
i	think	we	need	to	be	teaching	these	skills	to	kids	and	adults	at	every	stage	of	their	development	,	if	we	want	to	have	thinking	organizations	and	a	thinking	society	.
the	fact	is	that	most	of	the	biggest	catastrophes	that	we	've	witnessed	rarely	come	from	information	that	is	secret	or	hidden	.
it	comes	from	information	that	is	freely	available	and	out	there	,	but	that	we	are	willfully	blind	to	,	because	we	ca	n't	handle	,	do	n't	want	to	handle	,	the	conflict	that	it	provokes	.
but	when	we	dare	to	break	that	silence	,	or	when	we	dare	to	see	,	and	we	create	conflict	,	we	enable	ourselves	and	the	people	around	us	to	do	our	very	best	thinking	.
open	information	is	fantastic	,	open	networks	are	essential	.
but	the	truth	wo	n't	set	us	free	until	we	develop	the	skills	and	the	habit	and	the	talent	and	the	moral	courage	to	use	it	.
openness	is	n't	the	end	.
it	's	the	beginning	.
