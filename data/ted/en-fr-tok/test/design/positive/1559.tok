i	thought	i	would	start	with	a	very	brief	history	of	cities	.
settlements	typically	began	with	people	clustered	around	a	well	,	and	the	size	of	that	settlement	was	roughly	the	distance	you	could	walk	with	a	pot	of	water	on	your	head	.
in	fact	,	if	you	fly	over	germany	,	for	example	,	and	you	look	down	and	you	see	these	hundreds	of	little	villages	,	they	're	all	about	a	mile	apart	.
you	needed	easy	access	to	the	fields	.
and	for	hundreds	,	even	thousands	of	years	,	the	home	was	really	the	center	of	life	.
life	was	very	small	for	most	people	.
it	was	the	center	of	entertainment	,	of	energy	production	,	of	work	,	the	center	of	health	care	.
that	's	where	babies	were	born	and	people	died	.
then	,	with	industrialization	,	everything	started	to	become	centralized	.
you	had	dirty	factories	that	were	moved	to	the	outskirts	of	cities	.
production	was	centralized	in	assembly	plants	.
you	had	centralized	energy	production	.
learning	took	place	in	schools	.	health	care	took	place	in	hospitals	.
and	then	you	had	networks	that	developed	.
you	had	water	,	sewer	networks	that	allowed	for	this	kind	of	unchecked	expansion	.
you	had	separated	functions	,	increasingly	.
you	had	rail	networks	that	connected	residential	,	industrial	,	commercial	areas	.	you	had	auto	networks	.
in	fact	,	the	model	was	really	,	give	everybody	a	car	,	build	roads	to	everything	,	and	give	people	a	place	to	park	when	they	get	there	.	it	was	not	a	very	functional	model	.
and	we	still	live	in	that	world	,	and	this	is	what	we	end	up	with	.
so	you	have	the	sprawl	of	la	,	the	sprawl	of	mexico	city	.
you	have	these	unbelievable	new	cities	in	china	which	you	might	call	tower	sprawl	.
they	're	all	building	cities	on	the	model	that	we	invented	in	the	'50s	and	'60s	,	which	is	really	obsolete	,	i	would	argue	,	and	there	are	hundreds	and	hundreds	of	new	cities	that	are	being	planned	all	over	the	world	.
in	china	alone	,	300	million	people	,	some	say	400	million	people	,	will	move	to	the	city	over	the	next	15	years	.
that	means	building	the	entire	,	the	equivalent	of	the	entire	built	infrastructure	of	the	u.s.	in	15	years	.
imagine	that	.
and	we	should	all	care	about	this	whether	you	live	in	cities	or	not	.
cities	will	account	for	90	percent	of	the	population	growth	,	80	percent	of	the	global	co	2	,	75	percent	of	energy	use	,	but	at	the	same	time	it	's	where	people	want	to	be	,	increasingly	.
more	than	half	the	people	now	in	the	world	live	in	cities	,	and	that	will	just	continue	to	escalate	.	cities	are	places	of	celebration	,	personal	expression	.
you	have	the	flash	mobs	of	pillow	fights	that	--	i	've	been	to	a	couple	.	they	're	quite	fun	.
you	have	--	cities	are	where	most	of	the	wealth	is	created	,	and	particularly	in	the	developing	world	,	it	's	where	women	find	opportunities	.	that	's
a	lot	of	the	reason	why	cities	are	growing	very	quickly	.
now	there	's	some	trends	that	will	impact	cities	.
first	of	all	,	work	is	becoming	distributed	and	mobile	.
the	office	building	is	basically	obsolete	for	doing	private	work	.
the	home	,	once	again	,	because	of	distributed	computation	--	communication	,	is	becoming	a	center	of	life	,	so	it	's	a	center	of	production	and	learning	and	shopping	and	health	care	and	all	of	these	things	that	we	used	to	think	of	as	taking	place	outside	of	the	home	.
and	increasingly	,	everything	that	people	buy	,	every	consumer	product	,	in	one	way	or	another	,	can	be	personalized	.
and	that	's	a	very	important	trend	to	think	about	.
so	this	is	my	image	of	the	city	of	the	future	.
in	that	it	's	a	place	for	people	,	you	know	.
maybe	not	the	way	people	dress	,	but	--	you	know	,	the	question	now	is	,	how	can	we	have	all	the	good	things	that	we	identify	with	cities	without	all	the	bad	things	?
this	is	bangalore	.	it	took	me	a	couple	of	hours	to	get	a	few	miles	in	bangalore	last	year	.
so	with	cities	,	you	also	have	congestion	and	pollution	and	disease	and	all	these	negative	things	.
how	can	we	have	the	good	stuff	without	the	bad	?
so	we	went	back	and	started	looking	at	the	great	cities	that	evolved	before	the	cars	.
paris	was	a	series	of	these	little	villages	that	came	together	,	and	you	still	see	that	structure	today	.
the	20	arrondissements	of	paris	are	these	little	neighborhoods	.
most	of	what	people	need	in	life	can	be	within	a	five	-	or	10	-	minute	walk	.
and	if	you	look	at	the	data	,	when	you	have	that	kind	of	a	structure	,	you	get	a	very	even	distribution	of	the	shops	and	the	physicians	and	the	pharmacies	and	the	cafes	in	paris	.
and	then	you	look	at	cities	that	evolved	after	the	automobile	,	and	it	's	not	that	kind	of	a	pattern	.
there	's	very	little	that	's	within	a	five	minute	walk	of	most	areas	of	places	like	pittsburgh	.
not	to	pick	on	pittsburgh	,	but	most	american	cities	really	have	evolved	this	way	.
so	we	said	,	we	'll	,	let	's	look	at	new	cities	,	and	we	're	involved	in	a	couple	of	new	city	projects	in	china	.
so	we	said	,	let	's	start	with	that	neighborhood	cell	.
we	think	of	it	as	a	compact	urban	cell	.
so	provide	most	of	what	most	people	want	within	that	20	-	minute	walk	.
this	can	also	be	a	resilient	electrical	microgrid	,	community	heating	,	power	,	communication	networks	,	etc	.	,	can	be	concentrated	there	.
stewart	brand	would	put	a	micro	-	nuclear	reactor	right	in	the	center	,	probably	.
and	he	might	be	right	.
and	then	we	can	form	,	in	effect	,	a	mesh	network	.
it	's	something	of	an	internet	typology	pattern	,	so	you	can	have	a	series	of	these	neighborhoods	.
you	can	dial	up	the	density	--	about	20,000	people	per	cell	if	it	's	cambridge	.	go	up	to	50,000	if	it	's	manhattan	density	.	you	connect	everything	with	mass	transit	and	you	provide	most	of	what	most	people	need	within	that	neighborhood	.
you	can	begin	to	develop	a	whole	typology	of	streetscapes	and	the	vehicles	that	can	go	on	them	.	i	wo	n't	go	through	all	of	them	.	i	'll	just	show	one	.
this	is	boulder	.	it	's	a	great	example	of	kind	of	a	mobility	parkway	,	a	superhighway	for	joggers	and	bicyclists	where	you	can	go	from	one	end	of	the	city	to	the	other	without	crossing	the	street	,	and	they	also	have	bike	-	sharing	,	which	i	'll	get	into	in	a	minute	.
this	is	even	a	more	interesting	solution	in	seoul	,	korea	.
they	took	the	elevated	highway	,	they	got	rid	of	it	,	they	reclaimed	the	street	,	the	river	down	below	,	below	the	street	,	and	you	can	go	from	one	end	of	seoul	to	the	other	without	crossing	a	pathway	for	cars	.
the	highline	in	manhattan	is	very	similar	.
you	have	these	rapidly	emerging	bike	lanes	all	over	the	world	.	i	lived	in	manhattan	for	15	years	.
i	went	back	a	couple	of	weekends	ago	,	took	this	photograph	of	these	fabulous	new	bike	lanes	that	they	have	installed	.
they	're	still	not	to	where	copenhagen	is	,	where	something	like	42	percent	of	the	trips	within	the	city	are	by	bicycle	.	it	's	mostly	just	because	they	have	fantastic	infrastructure	there	.
we	actually	did	exactly	the	wrong	thing	in	boston	.
we	--	the	big	dig	--	so	we	got	rid	of	the	highway	but	we	created	a	traffic	island	and	it	's	certainly	not	a	mobility	pathway	for	anything	other	than	cars	.
mobility	on	demand	is	something	we	've	been	thinking	about	,	so	we	think	we	need	an	ecosystem	of	these	shared	-	use	vehicles	connected	to	mass	transit	.
these	are	some	of	the	vehicles	that	we	've	been	working	on	.
but	shared	use	is	really	key	.	if	you	share	a	vehicle	,	you	can	have	at	least	four	people	use	one	vehicle	,	as	opposed	to	one	.
we	have	hubway	here	in	boston	,	the	v√©lib	'	system	in	paris	.
we	've	been	developing	at	the	media	lab	this	little	city	car	that	is	optimized	for	shared	use	in	cities	.
we	got	rid	of	all	the	useless	things	like	engines	and	transmissions	.	we	moved	everything	to	the	wheels	,	so	you	have	the	drive	motor	,	the	steering	motor	,	the	breaking	all	in	the	wheel	.
that	left	the	chassis	unencumbered	,	so	you	can	do	things	like	fold	,	so	you	can	fold	this	little	vehicle	up	to	occupy	a	tiny	little	footprint	.
this	was	a	video	that	was	on	european	television	last	week	showing	the	spanish	minister	of	industry	driving	this	little	vehicle	,	and	when	it	's	folded	,	it	can	spin	.
you	do	n't	need	reverse	.	you	do	n't	need	parallel	parking	.
you	just	spin	and	go	directly	in	.	so	we	've	been	working	with	a	company	to	commercialize	this	.	my	phd	student	ryan	chin	presented	these	early	ideas	two	years	ago	at	a	tedx	conference	.
so	what	's	interesting	is	,	then	if	you	begin	to	add	new	things	to	it	,	like	autonomy	,	you	get	out	of	the	car	,	you	park	at	your	destination	,	you	pat	it	on	the	butt	,	it	goes	and	it	parks	itself	,	it	charges	itself	,	and	you	can	get	something	like	seven	times	as	many	vehicles	in	a	given	area	as	conventional	cars	,	and	we	think	this	is	the	future	.	actually	we	could	do	this	today	.
it	's	not	really	a	problem	.
we	can	combine	shared	use	and	folding	and	autonomy	and	we	get	something	like	28	times	the	land	utilization	with	that	kind	of	strategy	.
one	of	our	graduate	students	then	says	,	well	,	how	does	a	driverless	car	communicate	with	pedestrians	?
you	have	nobody	to	make	eye	contact	with	.
you	do	n't	know	if	it	's	going	to	run	you	over	.
so	he	's	developing	strategies	so	the	vehicle	can	communicate	with	pedestrians	,	so	--	so	the	headlights	are	eyeballs	,	the	pupils	can	dilate	,	we	have	directional	audio	,	we	can	throw	sound	directly	at	people	.
what	i	love	about	this	project	is	he	solved	a	problem	that	has	n't	,	that	does	n't	exist	yet	,	so	--	we	also	think	that	we	can	democratize	access	to	bike	lanes	.
you	know	,	bike	lanes	are	mostly	used	by	young	guys	in	stretchy	pants	,	you	know	.	so	--
we	think	we	can	develop	a	vehicle	that	operates	on	bike	lanes	,	accessible	to	elderly	and	disabled	,	women	in	skirts	,	businesspeople	,	and	address	the	issues	of	energy	congestion	,	mobility	,	aging	and	obesity	simultaneously	.	that	's	our	challenge	.
this	is	an	early	design	for	this	little	three	-	wheel	,	it	's	an	electronic	bike	.	you	have	to	pedal	to	operate	it	in	a	bike	lane	,	but	if	you	're	an	older	person	,	that	's	a	switch	.	if	you	're	a	healthy	person	,	you	might	have	to	work	really	hard	to	go	fast	.
you	can	dial	in	40	calories	going	into	work	and	500	going	home	,	when	you	can	take	a	shower	.
we	hope	to	have	that	built	this	fall	.
housing	is	another	area	where	we	can	really	improve	.
mayor	menino	in	boston	says	lack	of	affordable	housing	for	young	people	is	one	of	the	biggest	problems	the	city	faces	.
developers	say	,	okay	,	we	'll	build	little	teeny	apartments	.
people	say	,	we	do	n't	really	want	to	live	in	a	little	teeny	conventional	apartment	.
so	we	're	saying	let	's	build	a	standardized	chassis	,	much	like	our	car	.	let	's	bring	advanced	technology	into	the	apartment	,	technology	-	enabled	infill	,	give	people	the	tools	within	this	open	-	loft	chassis	to	go	through	a	process	of	defining	what	their	needs	and	values	and	activities	are	,	and	then	a	matching	algorithm	will	match	a	unique	assembly	of	integrated	infill	components	,	furniture	,	and	cabinetry	,	that	are	personalized	to	that	individual	,	and	they	give	them	the	tools	to	go	through	the	process	and	to	refine	it	,	and	it	's	something	like	working	with	an	architect	,	where	the	dialogue	starts	when	you	give	an	alternative	to	a	person	to	react	to	.
now	,	the	most	interesting	implementation	of	that	for	us	is	when	you	can	begin	to	have	robotic	walls	,	so	your	space	can	convert	from	exercise	to	a	workplace	,	if	you	run	a	virtual	company	.
you	have	guests	over	,	you	have	two	guestrooms	that	are	developed	.
you	have	a	conventional	one	-	bedroom	arrangement	when	you	need	it	.	maybe	that	's	most	of	the	time	.
you	have	a	dinner	party	.	the	table	folds	out	to	fit	16	people	in	otherwise	a	conventional	one	-	bedroom	,	or	maybe	you	want	a	dance	studio	.
i	mean	,	architects	have	been	thinking	about	these	ideas
for	a	long	time	.	what	we	need	to	do	now	,	develop	things	that	can	scale	to	those	300	million	chinese	people	that	would	like	to	live	in	the	city	,	and	very	comfortably	.
we	think	we	can	make	a	very	small	apartment	that	functions	as	if	it	's	twice	as	big	by	utilizing	these	strategies	.	i	do	n't	believe	in	smart	homes	.
that	's	sort	of	a	bogus	concept	.
i	think	you	have	to	build	dumb	homes	and	put	smart	stuff	in	it	.
and	so	we	've	been	working	on	a	chassis	of	the	wall	itself	.
you	know	,	standardized	platform	with	the	motors	and	the	battery	when	it	operates	,	little	solenoids	that	will	lock	it	in	place	and	get	low	-	voltage	power	.
we	think	this	can	all	be	standardized	,	and	then	people	can	personalize	the	stuff	that	goes	into	that	wall	,	and	like	the	car	,	we	can	integrate	all	kinds	of	sensing	to	be	aware	of	human	activity	,	so	if	there	's	a	baby	or	a	puppy	in	the	way	,	you	wo	n't	have	a	problem	.
so	the	developers	say	,	well	this	is	great	.	okay	,	so	if	we	have	a	conventional	building	,	we	have	a	fixed	envelope	,	maybe	we	can	put	in	14	units	.
if	they	function	as	if	they	're	twice	as	big	,	we	can	get	28	units	in	.
that	means	twice	as	much	parking	,	though	.
parking	's	really	expensive	.	it	's	about	70,000	dollars	per	space	to	build	a	conventional	parking	spot	inside	a	building	.
so	if	you	can	have	folding	and	autonomy	,	you	can	do	that	in	one	seventh	of	the	space	.
that	goes	down	to	10,000	dollars	per	car	,	just	for	the	cost	of	the	parking	.
you	add	shared	use	,	and	you	can	even	go	further	.
we	can	also	integrate	all	kinds	of	advanced	technology	through	this	process	.	there	's	a	path	to	market	for	innovative	companies	to	bring	technology	into	the	home	.
in	this	case	,	a	project	we	're	doing	with	siemens	,	we	have	sensors	on	all	the	furniture	,	all	the	infill	,	that	understands	where	people	are	and	what	they	're	doing	.
blue	light	is	very	efficient	,	so	we	have	these	tunable	24	-	bit	led	lighting	fixtures	.
it	recognizes	where	the	person	is	,	what	they	're	doing	,	fills	out	the	light	when	necessary	to	full	spectrum	white	light	,	and	saves	maybe	30	,	40	percent	in	energy	consumption	,	we	think	,	over	even	conventional	state	-	of	-	the	-	art	lighting	systems	.
this	just	shows	you	the	data	that	comes	from	the	sensors	that	are	embedded	in	the	furniture	.
we	do	n't	really	believe	in	cameras	to	do	things	in	homes	.
we	think	these	little	wireless	sensors	are	more	effective	.
we	think	we	can	also	personalize	sunlight	.
that	's	sort	of	the	ultimate	personalization	in	some	ways	.
so	we	,	we	've	looked	at	articulating	mirrors	of	the	facade	that	can	throw	shafts	of	sunlight	anywhere	into	the	space	,	therefore	allowing	you	to	shade	most	of	the	glass	on	a	hot	day	like	today	.
in	this	case	,	she	picks	up	her	phone	,	she	can	map	food	preparation	at	the	kitchen	island	to	a	particular	location	of	sunlight	.	an	algorithm	will	keep	it	in	that	location	as	long	as	she	's	engaged	in	that	activity	.
this	can	be	combined	with	led	lighting	as	well	.
we	think	workplaces	should	be	shared	.
i	mean	,	this	is	really	the	workplace	of	the	future	,	i	think	.
this	is	starbucks	,	you	know	.
maybe	a	third	--	and	you	see	everybody	has	their	back	to	the	wall	and	they	have	food	and	coffee	down	the	way	and	they	're	in	their	own	little	personal	bubble	.
we	need	shared	spaces	for	interaction	and	collaboration	.
we	're	not	doing	a	very	good	job	with	that	.
at	the	cambridge	innovation	center	,	you	can	have	shared	desks	.	i	've	spent	a	lot	of	time	in	finland	at	the	design	factory	of	aalto	university	,	where	the	they	have	a	shared	shop	and	shared	fablab	,	shared	quiet	spaces	,	electronics	spaces	,	recreation	places	.
we	think	ultimately	all	of	this	stuff	can	come	together	,	a	new	model	for	mobility	,	a	new	model	for	housing	,	a	new	model	for	how	we	live	and	work	,	a	path	to	market	for	advanced	technologies	,	but	in	the	end	the	main	thing	we	need	to	focus	on	are	people	.	cities	are	all	about	people	.
they	're	places	for	people	.
there	's	no	reason	why	we	ca	n't	dramatically	improve	the	livability	and	creativity	of	cities	like	they	've	done	in	melbourne	with	the	laneways	while	at	the	same	time	dramatically	reducing	co	2	and	energy	.
it	's	a	global	imperative	.	we	have	to	get	this	right	.
thank	you	.
