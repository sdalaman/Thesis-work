now	,	if	president	obama	invited	me	to	be	the	next	czar	of	mathematics	,	then	i	would	have	a	suggestion	for	him	that	i	think	would	vastly	improve	the	mathematics	education	in	this	country	.
and	it	would	be	easy	to	implement	and	inexpensive	.
the	mathematics	curriculum	that	we	have	is	based	on	a	foundation	of	arithmetic	and	algebra	.
and	everything	we	learn	after	that	is	building	up	towards	one	subject	.
and	at	top	of	that	pyramid	,	it	's	calculus	.
and	i	'm	here	to	say	that	i	think	that	that	is	the	wrong	summit	of	the	pyramid	...
that	the	correct	summit	--	that	all	of	our	students	,	every	high	school	graduate	should	know	--	should	be	statistics	:	probability	and	statistics	.
i	mean	,	do	n't	get	me	wrong	.	calculus	is	an	important	subject	.
it	's	one	of	the	great	products	of	the	human	mind	.
the	laws	of	nature	are	written	in	the	language	of	calculus	.
and	every	student	who	studies	math	,	science	,	engineering	,	economics	,	they	should	definitely	learn	calculus	by	the	end	of	their	freshman	year	of	college	.
but	i	'm	here	to	say	,	as	a	professor	of	mathematics	,	that	very	few	people	actually	use	calculus	in	a	conscious	,	meaningful	way	,	in	their	day	-	to	-	day	lives	.
on	the	other	hand	,	statistics	--	that	's	a	subject	that	you	could	,	and	should	,	use	on	daily	basis	.	right	?
it	's	risk	.	it	's	reward	.	it	's	randomness	.
it	's	understanding	data	.
i	think	if	our	students	,	if	our	high	school	students	--	if	all	of	the	american	citizens	--	knew	about	probability	and	statistics	,	we	would	n't	be	in	the	economic	mess	that	we	're	in	today	.
not	only	--	thank	you	--	not	only	that	...
but	if	it	's	taught	properly	,	it	can	be	a	lot	of	fun	.
i	mean	,	probability	and	statistics	,	it	's	the	mathematics	of	games	and	gambling	.
it	's	analyzing	trends	.	it	's	predicting	the	future	.
look	,	the	world	has	changed	from	analog	to	digital	.
and	it	's	time	for	our	mathematics	curriculum	to	change	from	analog	to	digital	,
from	the	more	classical	,	continuous	mathematics	,	to	the	more	modern	,	discrete	mathematics	--
the	mathematics	of	uncertainty	,	of	randomness	,	of	data	--	that	being	probability	and	statistics	.
in	summary	,	instead	of	our	students	learning	about	the	techniques	of	calculus	,	i	think	it	would	be	far	more	significant	if	all	of	them	knew	what	two	standard	deviations	from	the	mean	means	.	and	i	mean	it	.
thank	you	very	much	.
