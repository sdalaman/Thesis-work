18	minutes	is	an	absolutely	brutal	time	limit	,	so	i	'm	going	to	dive	straight	in	,	right	at	the	point	where	i	get	this	thing	to	work	.
here	we	go	.	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	five	different	things	.
i	'm	going	to	talk	about	why	defeating	aging	is	desirable	.
i	'm	going	to	talk	about	why	we	have	to	get	our	shit	together	,	and	actually	talk	about	this	a	bit	more	than	we	do	.
i	'm	going	to	talk	about	feasibility	as	well	,	of	course	.
i	'm	going	to	talk	about	why	we	are	so	fatalistic	about	doing	anything	about	aging	.
and	then	i	'm	going	spend	perhaps	the	second	half	of	the	talk	talking	about	,	you	know	,	how	we	might	actually	be	able	to	prove	that	fatalism	is	wrong	,	namely	,	by	actually	doing	something	about	it	.
i	'm	going	to	do	that	in	two	steps	.
the	first	one	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	is	how	to	get	from	a	relatively	modest	amount	of	life	extension	--	which	i	'm	going	to	define	as	30	years	,	applied	to	people	who	are	already	in	middle	-	age	when	you	start	--	to	a	point	which	can	genuinely	be	called	defeating	aging	.
namely	,	essentially	an	elimination	of	the	relationship	between	how	old	you	are	and	how	likely	you	are	to	die	in	the	next	year	--	or	indeed	,	to	get	sick	in	the	first	place	.
and	of	course	,	the	last	thing	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	is	how	to	reach	that	intermediate	step	,	that	point	of	maybe	30	years	life	extension	.
so	i	'm	going	to	start	with	why	we	should	.
now	,	i	want	to	ask	a	question	.
hands	up	:	anyone	in	the	audience	who	is	in	favor	of	malaria	?
that	was	easy	.	ok	.
ok	.	hands	up	:	anyone	in	the	audience	who	's	not	sure	whether	malaria	is	a	good	thing	or	a	bad	thing	?
ok	.	so	we	all	think	malaria	is	a	bad	thing	.
that	's	very	good	news	,	because	i	thought	that	was	what	the	answer	would	be	.
now	the	thing	is	,	i	would	like	to	put	it	to	you	that	the	main	reason	why	we	think	that	malaria	is	a	bad	thing	is	because	of	a	characteristic	of	malaria	that	it	shares	with	aging	.
and	here	is	that	characteristic	.
the	only	real	difference	is	that	aging	kills	considerably	more	people	than	malaria	does	.
now	,	i	like	in	an	audience	,	in	britain	especially	,	to	talk	about	the	comparison	with	foxhunting	,	which	is	something	that	was	banned	after	a	long	struggle	,	by	the	government	not	very	many	months	ago	.
i	mean	,	i	know	i	'm	with	a	sympathetic	audience	here	,	but	,	as	we	know	,	a	lot	of	people	are	not	entirely	persuaded	by	this	logic	.
and	this	is	actually	a	rather	good	comparison	,	it	seems	to	me	.
you	know	,	a	lot	of	people	said	,	``	well	,	you	know	,	city	boys	have	no	business	telling	us	rural	types	what	to	do	with	our	time	.
it	's	a	traditional	part	of	the	way	of	life	,	and	we	should	be	allowed	to	carry	on	doing	it	.
it	's	ecologically	sound	;	it	stops	the	population	explosion	of	foxes	.	``
but	ultimately	,	the	government	prevailed	in	the	end	,	because	the	majority	of	the	british	public	,	and	certainly	the	majority	of	members	of	parliament	,	came	to	the	conclusion	that	it	was	really	something	that	should	not	be	tolerated	in	a	civilized	society	.
and	i	think	that	human	aging	shares	all	of	these	characteristics	in	spades	.
what	part	of	this	do	people	not	understand	?
it	's	not	just	about	life	,	of	course	--	--	it	's	about	healthy	life	,	you	know	--	getting	frail	and	miserable	and	dependent	is	no	fun	,	whether	or	not	dying	may	be	fun	.
so	really	,	this	is	how	i	would	like	to	describe	it	.
it	's	a	global	trance	.
these	are	the	sorts	of	unbelievable	excuses	that	people	give	for	aging	.
and	,	i	mean	,	ok	,	i	'm	not	actually	saying	that	these	excuses	are	completely	valueless	.
there	are	some	good	points	to	be	made	here	,
things	that	we	ought	to	be	thinking	about	,	forward	planning	so	that	nothing	goes	too	--	well	,	so	that	we	minimize	the	turbulence	when	we	actually	figure	out	how	to	fix	aging	.
but	these	are	completely	crazy	,	when	you	actually	remember	your	sense	of	proportion	.
you	know	,	these	are	arguments	;	these	are	things	that	would	be	legitimate	to	be	concerned	about	.
but	the	question	is	,	are	they	so	dangerous	--	these	risks	of	doing	something	about	aging	--	that	they	outweigh	the	downside	of	doing	the	opposite	,	namely	,	leaving	aging	as	it	is	?
are	these	so	bad	that	they	outweigh	condemning	100,000	people	a	day	to	an	unnecessarily	early	death	?
you	know	,	if	you	have	n't	got	an	argument	that	's	that	strong	,	then	just	do	n't	waste	my	time	,	is	what	i	say	.
now	,	there	is	one	argument	that	some	people	do	think	really	is	that	strong	,	and	here	it	is	.
people	worry	about	overpopulation	;	they	say	,	``	well	,	if	we	fix	aging	,	no	one	's	going	to	die	to	speak	of	,	or	at	least	the	death	toll	is	going	to	be	much	lower	,	only	from	crossing	st.	giles	carelessly	.
and	therefore	,	we	're	not	going	to	be	able	to	have	many	kids	,	and	kids	are	really	important	to	most	people	.	``
and	that	's	true	.
and	you	know	,	a	lot	of	people	try	to	fudge	this	question	,	and	give	answers	like	this	.
i	do	n't	agree	with	those	answers	.	i	think	they	basically	do	n't	work	.
i	think	it	's	true	,	that	we	will	face	a	dilemma	in	this	respect	.
we	will	have	to	decide	whether	to	have	a	low	birth	rate	,	or	a	high	death	rate	.
a	high	death	rate	will	,	of	course	,	arise	from	simply	rejecting	these	therapies	,	in	favor	of	carrying	on	having	a	lot	of	kids	.
and	,	i	say	that	that	's	fine	--	the	future	of	humanity	is	entitled	to	make	that	choice	.
what	's	not	fine	is	for	us	to	make	that	choice	on	behalf	of	the	future	.
if	we	vacillate	,	hesitate	,	and	do	not	actually	develop	these	therapies	,	then	we	are	condemning	a	whole	cohort	of	people	--	who	would	have	been	young	enough	and	healthy	enough	to	benefit	from	those	therapies	,	but	will	not	be	,	because	we	have	n't	developed	them	as	quickly	as	we	could	--	we	'll	be	denying	those	people	an	indefinite	life	span	,	and	i	consider	that	that	is	immoral	.
that	's	my	answer	to	the	overpopulation	question	.
right	.	so	the	next	thing	is	,	now	why	should	we	get	a	little	bit	more	active	on	this	?
and	the	fundamental	answer	is	that	the	pro	-	aging	trance	is	not	as	dumb	as	it	looks	.
it	's	actually	a	sensible	way	of	coping	with	the	inevitability	of	aging	.
aging	is	ghastly	,	but	it	's	inevitable	,	so	,	you	know	,	we	've	got	to	find	some	way	to	put	it	out	of	our	minds	,	and	it	's	rational	to	do	anything	that	we	might	want	to	do	,	to	do	that	.
like	,	for	example	,	making	up	these	ridiculous	reasons	why	aging	is	actually	a	good	thing	after	all	.
but	of	course	,	that	only	works	when	we	have	both	of	these	components	.
and	as	soon	as	the	inevitability	bit	becomes	a	little	bit	unclear	--	and	we	might	be	in	range	of	doing	something	about	aging	--	this	becomes	part	of	the	problem	.
this	pro	-	aging	trance	is	what	stops	us	from	agitating	about	these	things	.
and	that	's	why	we	have	to	really	talk	about	this	a	lot	--	in	order	to	get	people	's	attention	,	and	make	people	realize	that	they	are	in	a	trance	in	this	regard	.
so	that	's	all	i	'm	going	to	say	about	that	.
i	'm	now	going	to	talk	about	feasibility	.
and	the	fundamental	reason	,	i	think	,	why	we	feel	that	aging	is	inevitable	is	summed	up	in	a	definition	of	aging	that	i	'm	giving	here	.
a	very	simple	definition	.
aging	is	a	side	effect	of	being	alive	in	the	first	place	,	which	is	to	say	,	metabolism	.
this	is	not	a	completely	tautological	statement	;	it	's	a	reasonable	statement	.
aging	is	basically	a	process	that	happens	to	inanimate	objects	like	cars	,	and	it	also	happens	to	us	,	despite	the	fact	that	we	have	a	lot	of	clever	self	-	repair	mechanisms	,	because	those	self	-	repair	mechanisms	are	not	perfect	.
so	basically	,	metabolism	,	which	is	defined	as	basically	everything	that	keeps	us	alive	from	one	day	to	the	next	,	has	side	effects	.
those	side	effects	accumulate	and	eventually	cause	pathology	.
that	's	a	fine	definition	.	so	we	can	put	it	this	way	:	we	can	say	that	,	you	know	,	we	have	this	chain	of	events	.
and	there	are	really	two	games	in	town	,	according	to	most	people	,	with	regard	to	postponing	aging	.	they	're	what	i	'm	calling	here	the	``	gerontology	approach	``	and	the	``	geriatrics	approach	.	``
the	geriatrician	will	intervene	late	in	the	day	,	when	pathology	is	becoming	evident	,	and	the	geriatrician	will	try	and	hold	back	the	sands	of	time	,	and	stop	the	accumulation	of	side	effects	from	causing	the	pathology	quite	so	soon	.
of	course	,	it	's	a	very	short	-	term	-	ist	strategy	;	it	's	a	losing	battle	,	because	the	things	that	are	causing	the	pathology	are	becoming	more	abundant	as	time	goes	on	.
the	gerontology	approach	looks	much	more	promising	on	the	surface	,	because	,	you	know	,	prevention	is	better	than	cure	.
but	unfortunately	the	thing	is	that	we	do	n't	understand	metabolism	very	well	.
in	fact	,	we	have	a	pitifully	poor	understanding	of	how	organisms	work	--	even	cells	we	're	not	really	too	good	on	yet	.
we	've	discovered	things	like	,	for	example	,	rna	interference	only	a	few	years	ago	,	and	this	is	a	really	fundamental	component	of	how	cells	work	.
basically	,	gerontology	is	a	fine	approach	in	the	end	,	but	it	is	not	an	approach	whose	time	has	come	when	we	're	talking	about	intervention	.
so	then	,	what	do	we	do	about	that	?
i	mean	,	that	's	a	fine	logic	,	that	sounds	pretty	convincing	,	pretty	ironclad	,	does	n't	it	?
but	it	is	n't	.
before	i	tell	you	why	it	is	n't	,	i	'm	going	to	go	a	little	bit	into	what	i	'm	calling	step	two	.
just	suppose	,	as	i	said	,	that	we	do	acquire	--	the	ability	to	confer	30	extra	years	of	healthy	life	on	people	who	are	already	in	middle	age	,	let	's	say	55	.
i	'm	going	to	call	that	``	robust	human	rejuvenation	.	``	ok	.
what	would	that	actually	mean	for	how	long	people	of	various	ages	today	--	or	equivalently	,	of	various	ages	at	the	time	that	these	therapies	arrive	--	would	actually	live	?
in	order	to	answer	that	question	--	you	might	think	it	's	simple	,	but	it	's	not	simple	.
we	ca	n't	just	say	,	``	well	,	if	they	're	young	enough	to	benefit	from	these	therapies	,	then	they	'll	live	30	years	longer	.	``
that	's	the	wrong	answer	.
and	the	reason	it	's	the	wrong	answer	is	because	of	progress	.
there	are	two	sorts	of	technological	progress	really	,	for	this	purpose	.
there	are	fundamental	,	major	breakthroughs	,	and	there	are	incremental	refinements	of	those	breakthroughs	.
now	,	they	differ	a	great	deal	in	terms	of	the	predictability	of	time	frames	.
fundamental	breakthroughs	:	very	hard	to	predict	how	long	it	's	going	to	take	to	make	a	fundamental	breakthrough	.
it	was	a	very	long	time	ago	that	we	decided	that	flying	would	be	fun	,	and	it	took	us	until	1903	to	actually	work	out	how	to	do	it	.
but	after	that	,	things	were	pretty	steady	and	pretty	uniform	.	i	think	this	is	a	reasonable	sequence	of	events	that	happened	in	the	progression	of	the	technology	of	powered	flight	.
we	can	think	,	really	,	that	each	one	is	sort	of	beyond	the	imagination	of	the	inventor	of	the	previous	one	,	if	you	like	.
the	incremental	advances	have	added	up	to	something	which	is	not	incremental	anymore	.
this	is	the	sort	of	thing	you	see	after	a	fundamental	breakthrough	.
and	you	see	it	in	all	sorts	of	technologies	.
computers	:	you	can	look	at	a	more	or	less	parallel	time	line	,	happening	of	course	a	bit	later	.
you	can	look	at	medical	care	.	i	mean	,	hygiene	,	vaccines	,	antibiotics	--	you	know	,	the	same	sort	of	time	frame	.
so	i	think	that	actually	step	two	,	that	i	called	a	step	a	moment	ago	,	is	n't	a	step	at	all	.
that	in	fact	,	the	people	who	are	young	enough	to	benefit	from	these	first	therapies	that	give	this	moderate	amount	of	life	extension	,	even	though	those	people	are	already	middle	-	aged	when	the	therapies	arrive	,	will	be	at	some	sort	of	cusp	.
they	will	mostly	survive	long	enough	to	receive	improved	treatments	that	will	give	them	a	further	30	or	maybe	50	years	.
in	other	words	,	they	will	be	staying	ahead	of	the	game	.
the	therapies	will	be	improving	faster	than	the	remaining	imperfections	in	the	therapies	are	catching	up	with	us	.
this	is	a	very	important	point	for	me	to	get	across	.
because	,	you	know	,	most	people	,	when	they	hear	that	i	predict	that	a	lot	of	people	alive	today	are	going	to	live	to	1,000	or	more	,	they	think	that	i	'm	saying	that	we	're	going	to	invent	therapies	in	the	next	few	decades	that	are	so	thoroughly	eliminating	aging	that	those	therapies	will	let	us	live	to	1,000	or	more	.
i	'm	not	saying	that	at	all	.
i	'm	saying	that	the	rate	of	improvement	of	those	therapies	will	be	enough	.
they	'll	never	be	perfect	,	but	we	'll	be	able	to	fix	the	things	that	200	-	year	-	olds	die	of	,	before	we	have	any	200	-	year	-	olds	.	and	the	same	for	300	and	400	and	so	on	.
i	decided	to	give	this	a	little	name	,	which	is	``	longevity	escape	velocity	.	``
well	,	it	seems	to	get	the	point	across	.
so	,	these	trajectories	here	are	basically	how	we	would	expect	people	to	live	,	in	terms	of	remaining	life	expectancy	,	as	measured	by	their	health	,	for	given	ages	that	they	were	at	the	time	that	these	therapies	arrive	.
if	you	're	already	100	,	or	even	if	you	're	80	--	and	an	average	80	-	year	-	old	,	we	probably	ca	n't	do	a	lot	for	you	with	these	therapies	,	because	you	're	too	close	to	death	's	door	for	the	really	initial	,	experimental	therapies	to	be	good	enough	for	you	.
you	wo	n't	be	able	to	withstand	them	.
but	if	you	're	only	50	,	then	there	's	a	chance	that	you	might	be	able	to	pull	out	of	the	dive	and	,	you	know	--	--	eventually	get	through	this
and	start	becoming	biologically	younger	in	a	meaningful	sense	,	in	terms	of	your	youthfulness	,	both	physical	and	mental	,	and	in	terms	of	your	risk	of	death	from	age	-	related	causes	.
and	of	course	,	if	you	're	a	bit	younger	than	that	,	then	you	're	never	really	even	going	to	get	near	to	being	fragile	enough	to	die	of	age	-	related	causes	.
so	this	is	a	genuine	conclusion	that	i	come	to	,	that	the	first	150	-	year	-	old	--	we	do	n't	know	how	old	that	person	is	today	,	because	we	do	n't	know	how	long	it	's	going	to	take	to	get	these	first	-	generation	therapies	.
but	irrespective	of	that	age	,	i	'm	claiming	that	the	first	person	to	live	to	1,000	--	subject	of	course	,	to	,	you	know	,	global	catastrophes	--	is	actually	,	probably	,	only	about	10	years	younger	than	the	first	150	-	year	-	old	.
and	that	's	quite	a	thought	.
alright	,	so	finally	i	'm	going	to	spend	the	rest	of	the	talk	,	my	last	seven	-	and	-	a	-	half	minutes	,	on	step	one	;	namely	,	how	do	we	actually	get	to	this	moderate	amount	of	life	extension	that	will	allow	us	to	get	to	escape	velocity	?
and	in	order	to	do	that	,	i	need	to	talk	about	mice	a	little	bit	.
i	have	a	corresponding	milestone	to	robust	human	rejuvenation	.
i	'm	calling	it	``	robust	mouse	rejuvenation	,	``	not	very	imaginatively	.
and	this	is	what	it	is	.
i	say	we	're	going	to	take	a	long	-	lived	strain	of	mouse	,	which	basically	means	mice	that	live	about	three	years	on	average	.
we	do	exactly	nothing	to	them	until	they	're	already	two	years	old	.
and	then	we	do	a	whole	bunch	of	stuff	to	them	,
and	with	those	therapies	,	we	get	them	to	live	,	on	average	,	to	their	fifth	birthday	.
so	,	in	other	words	,	we	add	two	years	--	we	treble	their	remaining	lifespan	,	starting	from	the	point	that	we	started	the	therapies	.
the	question	then	is	,	what	would	that	actually	mean	for	the	time	frame	until	we	get	to	the	milestone	i	talked	about	earlier	for	humans	?
which	we	can	now	,	as	i	've	explained	,	equivalently	call	either	robust	human	rejuvenation	or	longevity	escape	velocity	.
secondly	,	what	does	it	mean	for	the	public	's	perception	of	how	long	it	's	going	to	take	for	us	to	get	to	those	things	,	starting	from	the	time	we	get	the	mice	?
and	thirdly	,	the	question	is	,	what	will	it	do	to	actually	how	much	people	want	it	?
and	it	seems	to	me	that	the	first	question	is	entirely	a	biology	question	,	and	it	's	extremely	hard	to	answer	.
one	has	to	be	very	speculative	,	and	many	of	my	colleagues	would	say	that	we	should	not	do	this	speculation	,	that	we	should	simply	keep	our	counsel	until	we	know	more	.
i	say	that	's	nonsense	.
i	say	we	absolutely	are	irresponsible	if	we	stay	silent	on	this	.
we	need	to	give	our	best	guess	as	to	the	time	frame	,	in	order	to	give	people	a	sense	of	proportion	so	that	they	can	assess	their	priorities	.
so	,	i	say	that	we	have	a	50/50	chance	of	reaching	this	rhr	milestone	,	robust	human	rejuvenation	,	within	15	years	from	the	point	that	we	get	to	robust	mouse	rejuvenation	.
15	years	from	the	robust	mouse	.
the	public	's	perception	will	probably	be	somewhat	better	than	that	.
the	public	tends	to	underestimate	how	difficult	scientific	things	are	.
so	they	'll	probably	think	it	's	five	years	away	.
they	'll	be	wrong	,	but	that	actually	wo	n't	matter	too	much	.
and	finally	,	of	course	,	i	think	it	's	fair	to	say	that	a	large	part	of	the	reason	why	the	public	is	so	ambivalent	about	aging	now	is	the	global	trance	i	spoke	about	earlier	,	the	coping	strategy	.
that	will	be	history	at	this	point	,	because	it	will	no	longer	be	possible	to	believe	that	aging	is	inevitable	in	humans	,	since	it	's	been	postponed	so	very	effectively	in	mice	.
so	we	're	likely	to	end	up	with	a	very	strong	change	in	people	's	attitudes	,	and	of	course	that	has	enormous	implications	.
so	in	order	to	tell	you	now	how	we	're	going	to	get	these	mice	,	i	'm	going	to	add	a	little	bit	to	my	description	of	aging	.
i	'm	going	to	use	this	word	``	damage	``	to	denote	these	intermediate	things	that	are	caused	by	metabolism	and	that	eventually	cause	pathology	.
because	the	critical	thing	about	this	is	that	even	though	the	damage	only	eventually	causes	pathology	,	the	damage	itself	is	caused	ongoing	-	ly	throughout	life	,	starting	before	we	're	born	.
but	it	is	not	part	of	metabolism	itself	.
and	this	turns	out	to	be	useful	.
because	we	can	re	-	draw	our	original	diagram	this	way	.
we	can	say	that	,	fundamentally	,	the	difference	between	gerontology	and	geriatrics	is	that	gerontology	tries	to	inhibit	the	rate	at	which	metabolism	lays	down	this	damage	.
and	i	'm	going	to	explain	exactly	what	damage	is	in	concrete	biological	terms	in	a	moment	.
and	geriatricians	try	to	hold	back	the	sands	of	time	by	stopping	the	damage	converting	into	pathology	.
and	the	reason	it	's	a	losing	battle	is	because	the	damage	is	continuing	to	accumulate	.
so	there	's	a	third	approach	,	if	we	look	at	it	this	way	.
we	can	call	it	the	``	engineering	approach	,	``	and	i	claim	that	the	engineering	approach	is	within	range	.
the	engineering	approach	does	not	intervene	in	any	processes	.
it	does	not	intervene	in	this	process	or	this	one	.
and	that	's	good	because	it	means	that	it	's	not	a	losing	battle	,	and	it	's	something	that	we	are	within	range	of	being	able	to	do	,	because	it	does	n't	involve	improving	on	evolution	.
the	engineering	approach	simply	says	,	``	let	's	go	and	periodically	repair	all	of	these	various	types	of	damage	--	not	necessarily	repair	them	completely	,	but	repair	them	quite	a	lot	,	so	that	we	keep	the	level	of	damage	down	below	the	threshold	that	must	exist	,	that	causes	it	to	be	pathogenic	.	``
we	know	that	this	threshold	exists	,	because	we	do	n't	get	age	-	related	diseases	until	we	're	in	middle	age	,	even	though	the	damage	has	been	accumulating	since	before	we	were	born	.
why	do	i	say	that	we	're	in	range	?	well	,	this	is	basically	it	.
the	point	about	this	slide	is	actually	the	bottom	.
if	we	try	to	say	which	bits	of	metabolism	are	important	for	aging	,	we	will	be	here	all	night	,	because	basically	all	of	metabolism	is	important	for	aging	in	one	way	or	another	.
this	list	is	just	for	illustration	;	it	is	incomplete	.
the	list	on	the	right	is	also	incomplete	.
it	's	a	list	of	types	of	pathology	that	are	age	-	related	,	and	it	's	just	an	incomplete	list	.
but	i	would	like	to	claim	to	you	that	this	list	in	the	middle	is	actually	complete	--	this	is	the	list	of	types	of	thing	that	qualify	as	damage	,	side	effects	of	metabolism	that	cause	pathology	in	the	end	,	or	that	might	cause	pathology	.
and	there	are	only	seven	of	them	.
they	're	categories	of	things	,	of	course	,	but	there	's	only	seven	of	them	.
cell	loss	,	mutations	in	chromosomes	,	mutations	in	the	mitochondria	and	so	on	.
first	of	all	,	i	'd	like	to	give	you	an	argument	for	why	that	list	is	complete	.
of	course	one	can	make	a	biological	argument	.
one	can	say	,	``	ok	,	what	are	we	made	of	?	``
we	're	made	of	cells	and	stuff	between	cells	.
what	can	damage	accumulate	in	?
the	answer	is	:	long	-	lived	molecules	,	because	if	a	short	-	lived	molecule	undergoes	damage	,	but	then	the	molecule	is	destroyed	--	like	by	a	protein	being	destroyed	by	proteolysis	--	then	the	damage	is	gone	,	too	.
it	's	got	to	be	long	-	lived	molecules	.
so	,	these	seven	things	were	all	under	discussion	in	gerontology	a	long	time	ago	and	that	is	pretty	good	news	,	because	it	means	that	,	you	know	,	we	've	come	a	long	way	in	biology	in	these	20	years	,	so	the	fact	that	we	have	n't	extended	this	list	is	a	pretty	good	indication	that	there	's	no	extension	to	be	done	.
however	,	it	's	better	than	that	;	we	actually	know	how	to	fix	them	all	,	in	mice	,	in	principle	--	and	what	i	mean	by	in	principle	is	,	we	probably	can	actually	implement	these	fixes	within	a	decade	.
some	of	them	are	partially	implemented	already	,	the	ones	at	the	top	.
i	have	n't	got	time	to	go	through	them	at	all	,	but	my	conclusion	is	that	,	if	we	can	actually	get	suitable	funding	for	this	,	then	we	can	probably	develop	robust	mouse	rejuvenation	in	only	10	years	,	but	we	do	need	to	get	serious	about	it	.
we	do	need	to	really	start	trying	.
so	of	course	,	there	are	some	biologists	in	the	audience	,	and	i	want	to	give	some	answers	to	some	of	the	questions	that	you	may	have	.
but	fundamentally	you	have	to	go	and	read	this	stuff	.	i	've	published	a	great	deal	on	this	;	i	cite	the	experimental	work	on	which	my	optimism	is	based	,	and	there	's	quite	a	lot	of	detail	there	.
the	detail	is	what	makes	me	confident	of	my	rather	aggressive	time	frames	that	i	'm	predicting	here	.
so	if	you	think	that	i	'm	wrong	,	you	'd	better	damn	well	go	and	find	out	why	you	think	i	'm	wrong	.
and	of	course	the	main	thing	is	that	you	should	n't	trust	people	who	call	themselves	gerontologists	because	,	as	with	any	radical	departure	from	previous	thinking	within	a	particular	field	,	you	know	,	you	expect	people	in	the	mainstream	to	be	a	bit	resistant	and	not	really	to	take	it	seriously	.
so	,	you	know	,	you	've	got	to	actually	do	your	homework	,	in	order	to	understand	whether	this	is	true	.
and	we	'll	just	end	with	a	few	things	.
one	thing	is	,	you	know	,	you	'll	be	hearing	from	a	guy	in	the	next	session	who	said	some	time	ago	that	he	could	sequence	the	human	genome	in	half	no	time	,	and	everyone	said	,	``	well	,	it	's	obviously	impossible	.	``
and	you	know	what	happened	.
so	,	you	know	,	this	does	happen	.
we	have	various	strategies	--	there	's	the	methuselah	mouse	prize	,	which	is	basically	an	incentive	to	innovate	,	and	to	do	what	you	think	is	going	to	work	,	and	you	get	money	for	it	if	you	win	.
there	's	a	proposal	to	actually	put	together	an	institute	.
this	is	what	's	going	to	take	a	bit	of	money	.
but	,	i	mean	,	look	--	how	long	does	it	take	to	spend	that	on	the	war	in	iraq	?
not	very	long	.	ok	.
it	's	got	to	be	philanthropic	,	because	profits	distract	biotech	,	but	it	's	basically	got	a	90	percent	chance	,	i	think	,	of	succeeding	in	this	.
and	i	think	we	know	how	to	do	it	.	and	i	'll	stop	there	.
thank	you	.
chris	anderson	:	ok	.	i	do	n't	know	if	there	's	going	to	be	any	questions	but	i	thought	i	would	give	people	the	chance	.
audience	:	since	you	've	been	talking	about	aging	and	trying	to	defeat	it	,	why	is	it	that	you	make	yourself	appear	like	an	old	man	?
ag	:	because	i	am	an	old	man	.	i	am	actually	158	.
audience	:	species	on	this	planet	have	evolved	with	immune	systems	to	fight	off	all	the	diseases	so	that	individuals	live	long	enough	to	procreate	.
however	,	as	far	as	i	know	,	all	the	species	have	evolved	to	actually	die	,	so	when	cells	divide	,	the	telomerase	get	shorter	,	and	eventually	species	die	.
so	,	why	does	--	evolution	has	--	seems	to	have	selected	against	immortality	,	when	it	is	so	advantageous	,	or	is	evolution	just	incomplete	?
ag	:	brilliant	.	thank	you	for	asking	a	question	that	i	can	answer	with	an	uncontroversial	answer	.
i	'm	going	to	tell	you	the	genuine	mainstream	answer	to	your	question	,	which	i	happen	to	agree	with	,
which	is	that	,	no	,	aging	is	not	a	product	of	selection	,	evolution	;	[	aging	]	is	simply	a	product	of	evolutionary	neglect	.
in	other	words	,	we	have	aging	because	it	's	hard	work	not	to	have	aging	;	you	need	more	genetic	pathways	,	more	sophistication	in	your	genes	in	order	to	age	more	slowly	,	and	that	carries	on	being	true	the	longer	you	push	it	out	.
so	,	to	the	extent	that	evolution	does	n't	matter	,	does	n't	care	whether	genes	are	passed	on	by	individuals	,	living	a	long	time	or	by	procreation	,	there	's	a	certain	amount	of	modulation	of	that	,	which	is	why	different	species	have	different	lifespans	,	but	that	's	why	there	are	no	immortal	species	.
ca	:	the	genes	do	n't	care	but	we	do	?
ag	:	that	's	right	.
audience	:	hello	.	i	read	somewhere	that	in	the	last	20	years	,	the	average	lifespan	of	basically	anyone	on	the	planet	has	grown	by	10	years	.
if	i	project	that	,	that	would	make	me	think	that	i	would	live	until	120	if	i	do	n't	crash	on	my	motorbike	.
that	means	that	i	'm	one	of	your	subjects	to	become	a	1,000	-	year	-	old	?
ag	:	if	you	lose	a	bit	of	weight	.
your	numbers	are	a	bit	out	.
the	standard	numbers	are	that	lifespans	have	been	growing	at	between	one	and	two	years	per	decade	.
so	,	it	's	not	quite	as	good	as	you	might	think	,	you	might	hope	.
but	i	intend	to	move	it	up	to	one	year	per	year	as	soon	as	possible	.
audience	:	i	was	told	that	many	of	the	brain	cells	we	have	as	adults	are	actually	in	the	human	embryo	,	and	that	the	brain	cells	last	80	years	or	so	.
if	that	is	indeed	true	,	biologically	are	there	implications	in	the	world	of	rejuvenation	?
if	there	are	cells	in	my	body	that	live	all	80	years	,	as	opposed	to	a	typical	,	you	know	,	couple	of	months	?
ag	:	there	are	technical	implications	certainly	.
basically	what	we	need	to	do	is	replace	cells	in	those	few	areas	of	the	brain	that	lose	cells	at	a	respectable	rate	,	especially	neurons	,	but	we	do	n't	want	to	replace	them	any	faster	than	that	--	or	not	much	faster	anyway	,	because	replacing	them	too	fast	would	degrade	cognitive	function	.
what	i	said	about	there	being	no	non	-	aging	species	earlier	on	was	a	little	bit	of	an	oversimplification	.
there	are	species	that	have	no	aging	--	hydra	for	example	--	but	they	do	it	by	not	having	a	nervous	system	--	and	not	having	any	tissues	in	fact	that	rely	for	their	function	on	very	long	-	lived	cells	.
