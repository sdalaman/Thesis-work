a	month	ago	today	i	stood	there	:
90	degrees	south	,	the	top	of	the	bottom	of	the	world	,	the	geographic	south	pole	.
and	i	stood	there	beside	two	very	good	friends	of	mine	,	richard	weber	and	kevin	vallely	.
together	we	had	just	broken	the	world	speed	record	for	a	trek	to	the	south	pole	.
it	took	us	33	days	,	23	hours	and	55	minutes	to	get	there	.
we	shaved	five	days	off	the	previous	best	time	.
and	in	the	process	,	i	became	the	first	person	in	history	to	make	the	entire	650	-	mile	journey	,	from	hercules	inlet	to	south	pole	,	solely	on	feet	,	without	skis	.
now	,	many	of	you	are	probably	saying	,	``	wait	a	sec	,	is	this	tough	to	do	?	``
imagine	,	if	you	will	,	dragging	a	sled	,	as	you	just	saw	in	that	video	clip	,	with	170	pounds	of	gear	,	in	it	everything	you	need	to	survive	on	your	antarctic	trek	.
it	's	going	to	be	40	below	,	every	single	day	.
you	'll	be	in	a	massive	headwind	.
and	at	some	point	you	're	going	to	have	to	cross	these	cracks	in	the	ice	,	these	crevasses	.
some	of	them	have	a	very	precarious	thin	footbridge	underneath	them	that	could	give	way	at	a	moment	's	notice	,	taking	your	sled	,	you	,	into	the	abyss	,	never	to	be	seen	again	.
the	punchline	to	your	journey	?	look	at	the	horizon	.
yes	,	it	's	uphill	the	entire	way	,
because	the	south	pole	is	at	10,000	feet	,
and	you	're	starting	at	sea	level	.
our	journey	did	not	,	in	fact	,	begin	at	hercules	inlet	,	where	frozen	ocean	meets	the	land	of	antarctica	.
it	began	a	little	less	than	two	years	ago	.
a	couple	of	buddies	of	mine	and	i	had	finished	a	111	-	day	run	across	the	entire	sahara	desert	.
and	while	we	were	there	we	learned	the	seriousness	of	the	water	crisis	in	northern	africa	.
we	also	learned	that	many	of	the	issues	facing	the	people	of	northern	africa	affected	young	people	the	most	.
i	came	home	to	my	wife	after	111	days	of	running	in	the	sand	,
and	i	said	,	``	you	know	,	there	's	no	doubt	if	this	bozo	can	get	across	the	desert	,	we	are	capable	of	doing	anything	we	set	our	minds	to	.	``
but	if	i	'm	going	to	continue	doing	these	adventures	,	there	has	to	be	a	reason	for	me	to	do	them	beyond	just	getting	there	.
around	that	time	i	met	an	extraordinary	human	being	,	peter	thum	,	who	inspired	me	with	his	actions	.
he	's	trying	to	find	and	solve	water	issues	,	the	crisis	around	the	world	.
his	dedication	inspired	me	to	come	up	with	this	expedition	:
a	run	to	the	south	pole	where	,	with	an	interactive	website	,	i	will	be	able	to	bring	young	people	,	students	and	teachers	from	around	the	world	on	board	the	expedition	with	me	,	as	active	members	.
so	we	would	have	a	live	website	,	that	every	single	day	of	the	33	days	,	we	would	be	blogging	,	telling	stories	of	,	you	know	,	depleted	ozone	forcing	us	to	cover	our	faces	,	or	we	will	burn	.
crossing	miles	and	miles	of	sastrugi	--	frozen	ice	snowdrifts	that	could	be	hip	-	deep	.
i	'm	telling	you	,	crossing	these	things	with	170	-	pound	sled	,	that	sled	may	as	well	have	weighed	1,700	pounds	,	because	that	's	what	it	felt	like	.
we	were	blogging	to	this	live	website	daily	to	these	students	that	were	tracking	us	as	well	,	about	10	-	hour	trekking	days	,	15	-	hour	trekking	days	,	sometimes	20	hours	of	trekking	daily	to	meet	our	goal	.
we	'd	catch	cat	-	naps	at	40	below	on	our	sled	,	incidentally	.
in	turn	,	students	,	people	from	around	the	world	,	would	ask	us	questions	.
young	people	would	ask	the	most	amazing	questions	.
one	of	my	favorite	:	it	's	40	below	,	you	've	got	to	go	to	the	bathroom	,	where	are	you	going	to	go	and	how	are	you	going	to	do	it	?
i	'm	not	going	to	answer	that	.	but	i	will	answer	some	of	the	more	popular	questions	.
where	do	you	sleep	?	we	slept	in	a	tent	that	was	very	low	to	the	ground	,
because	the	winds	on	antarctica	were	so	extreme	,	it	would	blow	anything	else	away	.
what	do	you	eat	?	one	of	my	favorite	dishes	on	expedition	:	butter	and	bacon	.	it	's	about	a	million	calories	.
we	were	burning	about	8,500	a	day	,
so	we	needed	it	.
how	many	batteries	do	you	carry	for	all	the	equipment	that	you	have	?
virtually	none	.	all	of	our	equipment	,	including	film	equipment	,	was	charged	by	the	sun	.
and	do	you	get	along	?	i	certainly	hope	so	,
because	at	some	point	or	another	on	this	expedition	,	one	of	your	teammates	is	going	to	have	to	take	a	very	big	needle	,	and	put	it	in	an	infected	blister	,	and	drain	it	for	you	.
but	seriously	,	seriously	,	we	did	get	along	,
because	we	had	a	common	goal	of	wanting	to	inspire	these	young	people	.
they	were	our	teammates	!	they	were	inspiring	us	.
the	stories	we	were	hearing	got	us	to	the	south	pole	.
the	website	worked	brilliantly	as	a	two	-	way	street	of	communication	.
young	people	in	northern	canada	,	kids	in	an	elementary	school	,	dragging	sleds	across	the	school	-	yard	,	pretending	they	were	richard	,	ray	and	kevin	.	amazing	.
we	arrived	at	the	south	pole	.	we	huddled	into	that	tent	,	45	below	that	day	,	i	'll	never	forget	it	.
we	looked	at	each	other	with	these	looks	of	disbelief	at	what	we	had	just	completed	.
and	i	remember	looking	at	the	guys	thinking	,	``	what	do	i	take	from	this	journey	?	``	you	know	?	seriously	.
that	i	'm	this	uber	-	endurance	guy	?
as	i	stand	here	today	talking	to	you	guys	,	i	've	been	running	for	the	grand	sum	of	five	years	.
and	a	year	before	that	i	was	a	pack	-	a	-	day	smoker	,	living	a	very	sedentary	lifestyle	.
what	i	take	from	this	journey	,	from	my	journeys	,	is	that	,	in	fact	,	within	every	fiber	of	my	belief	standing	here	,	i	know	that	we	can	make	the	impossible	possible	.
i	'm	learning	this	at	40	.
can	you	imagine	?	seriously	,	can	you	imagine	?
i	'm	learning	this	at	40	years	of	age	.
imagine	being	13	years	old	,	hearing	those	words	,	and	believing	it	.
thank	you	very	much	.	thank	you	.
