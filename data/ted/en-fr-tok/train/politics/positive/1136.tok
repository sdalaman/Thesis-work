phyllis	rodriguez	:	we	are	here	today	because	of	the	fact	that	we	have	what	most	people	consider	an	unusual	friendship	.
and	it	is	.
and	yet	,	it	feels	natural	to	us	now	.
i	first	learned	that	my	son	had	been	in	the	world	trade	center	on	the	morning	of	september	11th	,	2001	.
we	did	n't	know	if	he	had	perished	yet	until	36	hours	later	.
at	the	time	,	we	knew	that	it	was	political	.
we	were	afraid	of	what	our	country	was	going	to	do	in	the	name	of	our	son	--	my	husband	,	orlando	,	and	i	and	our	family	.
and	when	i	saw	it	--	and	yet	,	through	the	shock	,	the	terrible	shock	,	and	the	terrible	explosion	in	our	lives	,	literally	,	we	were	not	vengeful	.
and	a	couple	of	weeks	later	when	zacarias	moussaoui	was	indicted	on	six	counts	of	conspiracy	to	commit	terrorism	,	and	the	u.s.	government	called	for	a	death	penalty	for	him	,	if	convicted	,	my	husband	and	i	spoke	out	in	opposition	to	that	,	publicly	.	through	that	and	through	human	rights	groups	,	we	were	brought	together	with	several	other	victims	'	families	.	when	i	saw	aicha	in	the	media	,	coming	over	when	her	son	was	indicted	,	and	i	thought	,	``	what	a	brave	woman	.	someday	i	want	to	meet	that	woman	when	i	'm	stronger	.	``
i	was	still	in	deep	grief	;	i	knew	i	did	n't	have	the	strength	.
i	knew	i	would	find	her	someday	,	or	we	would	find	each	other	.
because	,	when	people	heard	that	my	son	was	a	victim	,	i	got	immediate	sympathy	.
but	when	people	learned	what	her	son	was	accused	of	,	she	did	n't	get	that	sympathy	.
but	her	suffering	is	equal	to	mine	.
so	we	met	in	november	2002	,
and	aicha	will	now	tell	you	how	that	came	about	.
aicha	el-wafi	:	good	afternoon	,	ladies	and	gentlemen	.
i	am	the	mother	of	zacarias	moussaoui	.
and	i	asked	the	organization	of	human	rights	to	put	me	in	touch	with	the	parents	of	the	victims	.
so	they	introduced	me	to	five	families	.
and	i	saw	phyllis	,	and	i	watched	her	.
she	was	the	only	mother	in	the	group	.
the	others	were	brothers	,	sisters	.
and	i	saw	in	her	eyes	that	she	was	a	mother	,	just	like	me	.
i	suffered	a	lot	as	a	mother	.
i	was	married	when	i	was	14	.
i	lost	a	child	when	i	was	15	,	a	second	child	when	i	was	16	.
so	the	story	with	zacarias	was	too	much	really	.
and	i	still	suffer	,	because	my	son	is	like	he	's	buried	alive	.
i	know	she	really	cried	for	her	son	.
but	she	knows	where	he	is	.
my	son	,	i	do	n't	know	where	he	is	.
i	do	n't	know	if	he	's	alive	.	i	do	n't	know	if	he	's	tortured	.
i	do	n't	know	what	happened	to	him	.
so	that	's	why	i	decided	to	tell	my	story	,	so	that	my	suffering	is	something	positive	for	other	women	.
for	all	the	women	,	all	the	mothers	that	give	life	,	you	can	give	back	,	you	can	change	.
it	's	up	to	us	women	,	because	we	are	women	,	because	we	love	our	children	.
we	must	be	hand	-	in	-	hand	and	do	something	together	.
it	's	not	against	women	,	it	's	for	us	,	for	us	women	,	for	our	children	.
i	talk	against	violence	,	against	terrorism	.
i	go	to	schools	to	talk	to	young	,	muslim	girls	so	they	do	n't	accept	to	be	married	against	their	will	very	young	.
so	if	i	can	save	one	of	the	young	girls	,	and	avoid	that	they	get	married	and	suffer	as	much	as	i	did	,	well	this	is	something	good	.
this	is	why	i	'm	here	in	front	of	you	.
pr	:	i	would	like	to	say	that	i	have	learned	so	much	from	aicha	,	starting	with	that	day	we	had	our	very	first	meeting	with	other	family	members	--	which	was	a	very	private	meeting	with	security	,	because	it	was	november	2002	,	and	,	frankly	,	we	were	afraid	of	the	super	-	patriotism	of	that	time	in	the	country	--	those	of	us	family	members	.
but	we	were	all	so	nervous	.
``	why	does	she	want	to	meet	us	?	``	and	then	she	was	nervous	.
``	why	did	we	want	to	meet	her	?	``	what	did	we	want	from	each	other	?
before	we	knew	each	others	'	names	,	or	anything	,	we	had	embraced	and	wept	.	then	we	sat	in	a	circle	with	support	,	with	help	,	from	people	experienced	in	this	kind	of	reconciliation	.
and	aicha	started	,	and	she	said	,	``	i	do	n't	know	if	my	son	is	guilty	or	innocent	,	but	i	want	to	tell	you	how	sorry	i	am	for	what	happened	to	your	families	.
i	know	what	it	is	to	suffer	,	and	i	feel	that	if	there	is	a	crime	,	a	person	should	be	tried	fairly	and	punished	.	``
but	she	reached	out	to	us	in	that	way	,
and	it	was	,	i	'd	like	to	say	,	it	was	an	ice	-	breaker	.
and	what	happened	then	is	we	all	told	our	stories	,	and	we	all	connected	as	human	beings	.
by	the	end	of	the	afternoon	--	it	was	about	three	hours	after	lunch	--	we	'd	felt	as	if	we	'd	known	each	other	forever	.
now	what	i	learned	from	her	,	is	a	woman	,	not	only	who	could	be	so	generous	under	these	present	circumstances	and	what	it	was	then	,	and	what	was	being	done	to	her	son	,	but	the	life	she	's	had	.
i	never	had	met	someone	with	such	a	hard	life	,	from	such	a	totally	different	culture	and	environment	from	my	own	.
and	i	feel	that	we	have	a	special	connection	,	which	i	value	very	much	.
and	i	think	it	's	all	about	being	afraid	of	the	other	,
but	making	that	step	and	then	realizing	,	``	hey	,	this	was	n't	so	hard	.
who	else	can	i	meet	that	i	do	n't	know	,	or	that	i	'm	so	different	from	?	``
so	,	aicha	,	do	you	have	a	couple	of	words	for	conclusion	?
because	our	time	is	up	.
aw	:	i	wanted	to	say	that	we	have	to	try	to	know	other	people	,	the	other	.
you	have	to	be	generous	,	and	your	hearts	must	be	generous	,	your	mind	must	be	generous	.
you	must	be	tolerant	.
you	have	to	fight	against	violence	.
and	i	hope	that	someday	we	'll	all	live	together	in	peace	and	respecting	each	other	.
this	is	what	i	wanted	to	say	.
