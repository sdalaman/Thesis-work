good	afternoon	.
if	you	have	followed	diplomatic	news	in	the	past	weeks	,	you	may	have	heard	of	a	kind	of	crisis	between	china	and	the	u.s.	regarding	cyberattacks	against	the	american	company	google	.
many	things	have	been	said	about	this	.	some	people	have	called	a	cyberwar	what	may	actually	be	just	a	spy	operation	--	and	obviously	,	a	quite	mishandled	one	.
however	,	this	episode	reveals	the	growing	anxiety	in	the	western	world	regarding	these	emerging	cyber	weapons	.
it	so	happens	that	these	weapons	are	dangerous	.	they	're	of	a	new	nature	:	they	could	lead	the	world	into	a	digital	conflict	that	could	turn	into	an	armed	struggle	.
these	virtual	weapons	can	also	destroy	the	physical	world	.
in	1982	,	in	the	middle	of	the	cold	war	in	soviet	siberia	,	a	pipeline	exploded	with	a	burst	of	3	kilotons	,	the	equivalent	of	a	fourth	of	the	hiroshima	bomb	.
now	we	know	today	--	this	was	revealed	by	thomas	reed	,	ronald	reagan	's	former	u.s.	air	force	secretary	--	this	explosion	was	actually	the	result	of	a	cia	sabotage	operation	,	in	which	they	had	managed	to	infiltrate	the	it	management	systems	of	that	pipeline	.
more	recently	,	the	u.s.	government	revealed	that	in	september	2008	,	more	than	3	million	people	in	the	state	of	espirito	santo	in	brazil	were	plunged	into	darkness	,	victims	of	a	blackmail	operation	from	cyber	pirates	.
even	more	worrying	for	the	americans	,	in	december	2008	the	holiest	of	holies	,	the	it	systems	of	centcom	,	the	central	command	managing	the	wars	in	iraq	and	afghanistan	,	may	have	been	infiltrated	by	hackers	who	used	these	:	plain	but	infected	usb	keys	.	and	with	these	keys	,	they	may	have	been	able	to	get	inside	centcom	's	systems	,	to	see	and	hear	everything	,	and	maybe	even	infect	some	of	them	.
as	a	result	,	the	americans	take	the	threat	very	seriously	.	i	'll	quote	general	james	cartwright	,	vice	chairman	of	the	joint	chiefs	of	staff	,	who	says	in	a	report	to	congress	that	cyberattacks	could	be	as	powerful	as	weapons	of	mass	destruction	.
moreover	,	the	americans	have	decided	to	spend	over	30	billion	dollars	in	the	next	five	years	to	build	up	their	cyberwar	capabilities	.
and	across	the	world	today	,	we	see	a	sort	of	cyber	arms	race	,	with	cyberwar	units	built	up	by	countries	like	north	korea	or	even	iran	.
yet	,	what	you	'll	never	hear	from	spokespeople	from	the	pentagon	or	the	french	department	of	defence	is	that	the	question	is	n't	really	who	's	the	enemy	,	but	actually	the	very	nature	of	cyber	weapons	.
and	to	understand	why	,	we	must	look	at	how	,	through	the	ages	,	military	technologies	have	maintained	or	destroyed	world	peace	.
for	example	,	if	we	'd	had	tedxparis	350	years	ago	,	we	would	have	talked	about	the	military	innovation	of	the	day	--	the	massive	vauban	-	style	fortifications	--	and	we	could	have	predicted	a	period	of	stability	in	the	world	or	in	europe	.	which	was	indeed	the	case	in	europe	between	1650	and	1750	.
similarly	,	if	we	'd	had	this	talk	30	or	40	years	ago	,	we	would	have	seen	how	the	rise	of	nuclear	weapons	,	and	the	threat	of	mutually	assured	destruction	they	imply	,	prevents	a	direct	fight	between	the	two	superpowers	.
however	,	if	we	'd	had	this	talk	60	years	ago	,	we	would	have	seen	how	the	emergence	of	new	aircraft	and	tank	technologies	,	which	give	the	advantage	to	the	attacker	,	make	the	blitzkrieg	doctrine	very	credible	and	thus	create	the	possibility	of	war	in	europe	.
so	military	technologies	can	influence	the	course	of	the	world	,	can	make	or	break	world	peace	--	and	there	lies	the	issue	with	cyber	weapons	.
the	first	issue	:	imagine	a	potential	enemy	announcing	they	're	building	a	cyberwar	unit	,	but	only	for	their	country	's	defense	.
okay	,	but	what	distinguishes	it	from	an	offensive	unit	?
it	gets	even	more	complicated	when	the	doctrines	of	use	become	ambiguous	.
just	3	years	ago	,	both	the	u.s.	and	france	were	saying	they	were	investing	militarily	in	cyberspace	,	strictly	to	defend	their	it	systems	.
but	today	both	countries	say	the	best	defense	is	to	attack	.
and	so	,	they	're	joining	china	,	whose	doctrine	of	use	for	15	years	has	been	both	defensive	and	offensive	.
the	second	issue	:	your	country	could	be	under	cyberattack	with	entire	regions	plunged	into	total	darkness	,	and	you	may	not	even	know	who	's	attacking	you	.
cyber	weapons	have	this	peculiar	feature	:	they	can	be	used	without	leaving	traces	.
this	gives	a	tremendous	advantage	to	the	attacker	,
because	the	defender	does	n't	know	who	to	fight	back	against	.
and	if	the	defender	retaliates	against	the	wrong	adversary	,	they	risk	making	one	more	enemy	and	ending	up	diplomatically	isolated	.
this	issue	is	n't	just	theoretical	.
in	may	2007	,	estonia	was	the	victim	of	cyberattacks	,	that	damaged	its	communication	and	banking	systems	.
estonia	accused	russia	.
but	nato	,	though	it	defends	estonia	,	reacted	very	prudently	.	why	?
because	nato	could	n't	be	100	%	sure	that	the	kremlin	was	indeed	behind	these	attacks	.
so	to	sum	up	,	on	the	one	hand	,	when	a	possible	enemy	announces	they	're	building	a	cyberwar	unit	,	you	do	n't	know	whether	it	's	for	attack	or	defense	.	on	the	other	hand	,	we	know	that	these	weapons	give	an	advantage	to	attacking	.
in	a	major	article	published	in	1978	,	professor	robert	jervis	of	columbia	university	in	new	york	described	a	model	to	understand	how	conflicts	could	arise	.
in	this	context	,	when	you	do	n't	know	if	the	potential	enemy	is	preparing	for	defense	or	attack	,	and	if	the	weapons	give	an	advantage	to	attacking	,	then	this	environment	is	most	likely	to	spark	a	conflict	.
this	is	the	environment	that	's	being	created	by	cyber	weapons	today	,	and	historically	it	was	the	environment	in	europe	at	the	onset	of	world	war	i	.
so	cyber	weapons	are	dangerous	by	nature	,	but	in	addition	,	they	're	emerging	in	a	much	more	unstable	environment	.
if	you	remember	the	cold	war	,	it	was	a	very	hard	game	,	but	a	stable	one	played	only	by	two	players	,	which	allowed	for	some	coordination	between	the	two	superpowers	.
today	we	're	moving	to	a	multipolar	world	in	which	coordination	is	much	more	complicated	,	as	we	have	seen	at	copenhagen	.	and	this	coordination	may	become	even	trickier	with	the	introduction	of	cyber	weapons	.
why	?	because	no	nation	knows	for	sure	whether	its	neighbor	is	about	to	attack	.
so	nations	may	live	under	the	threat	of	what	nobel	prize	winner	thomas	schelling	called	the	``	reciprocal	fear	of	surprise	attack	,	``	as	i	do	n't	know	if	my	neighbor	is	about	to	attack	me	or	not	--	i	may	never	know	--	so	i	might	take	the	upper	hand	and	attack	first	.
just	last	week	,	in	a	new	york	times	article	dated	january	26	,	2010	,	it	was	revealed	for	the	first	time	that	officials	at	the	national	security	agency	were	considering	the	possibility	of	preemptive	attacks	in	cases	where	the	u.s.	was	about	to	be	cyberattacked	.
and	these	preemptive	attacks	might	not	just	remain	in	cyberspace	.
in	may	2009	,	general	kevin	chilton	,	commander	of	the	u.s.	nuclear	forces	,	stated	that	in	the	event	of	cyberattacks	against	the	u.s.	,	all	options	would	be	on	the	table	.
cyber	weapons	do	not	replace	conventional	or	nuclear	weapons	--
they	just	add	a	new	layer	to	the	existing	system	of	terror	.
but	in	doing	so	,	they	also	add	their	own	risk	of	triggering	a	conflict	--	as	we	've	just	seen	,	a	very	important	risk	--	and	a	risk	we	may	have	to	confront	with	a	collective	security	solution	which	includes	all	of	us	:	european	allies	,	nato	members	,	our	american	friends	and	allies	,	our	other	western	allies	,	and	maybe	,	by	forcing	their	hand	a	little	,	our	russian	and	chinese	partners	.
the	information	technologies	joÃ«l	de	rosnay	was	talking	about	,	which	were	historically	born	from	military	research	,	are	today	on	the	verge	of	developing	an	offensive	capability	of	destruction	,	which	could	tomorrow	,	if	we	're	not	careful	,	completely	destroy	world	peace	.
