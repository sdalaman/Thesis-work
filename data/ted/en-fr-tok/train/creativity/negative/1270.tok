i	was	offered	a	position	as	associate	professor	of	medicine	and	chief	of	scientific	visualization	at	yale	university	in	the	department	of	medicine	.
and	my	job	was	to	write	many	of	the	algorithms	and	code	for	nasa	to	do	virtual	surgery	in	preparation	for	the	astronauts	going	into	deep	spaceflight	,	so	they	could	be	kept	in	robotic	pods	.
one	of	the	fascinating	things	about	what	we	were	actually	working	on	is	that	we	were	seeing	,	using	new	kinds	of	scanning	technologies	,	things	that	had	just	never	been	seen	before	--	i	mean	,	not	only	in	disease	management	,	but	also	things	that	allowed	us	to	see	things	about	the	body	that	just	made	you	marvel	.
i	remember	one	of	the	first	times	we	were	looking	at	collagen	.
and	your	entire	body	,	everything	--	your	hair	,	skin	,	bone	,	nails	--	everything	is	made	of	collagen	.
and	it	's	a	kind	of	rope	-	like	structure	that	twirls	and	swirls	like	this	.
and	the	only	place	that	collagen	changes	its	structure	is	in	the	cornea	of	your	eye	.
in	your	eye	,	it	becomes	a	grid	formation	,	and	therefore	,	it	becomes	transparent	,	as	opposed	to	opaque	.
so	perfectly	organized	a	structure	,	it	was	hard	not	to	attribute	divinity	to	it	.
because	we	kept	on	seeing	this	over	and	over	and	over	again	in	different	parts	of	the	body	.
one	of	the	opportunities	i	had	was	one	person	was	working	on	a	really	interesting	micromagnetic	resonance	imaging	machine	with	the	nih	.
and	what	we	were	going	to	do	was	scan	a	new	project	on	the	development	of	the	fetus	from	conception	to	birth	using	these	kinds	of	new	technologies	.
so	i	wrote	the	algorithms	in	code	,	and	he	built	the	hardware	--	paul	lauterbur	--	then	went	onto	win	the	nobel	prize	for	inventing	the	mri	.
i	got	the	data	.
and	i	'm	going	to	show	you	a	sample	of	the	piece	,	``	from	conception	to	birth	.	``
video	text	:	``	from	conception	to	birth	``	oocyte	sperm	egg	inseminated	24	hours	:	baby	's	first	division	the	fertilized	ovum	divides	a	few	hours	after	fusion	...	and	divides	anew	every	12	to	15	hours	.
early	embryo	yolk	sack	still	feeding	baby	.
25	days	:	heart	chamber	developing	32	days	:	arms	&	hands	are	developing	36	days	:	beginning	of	the	primitive	vertabrae	these	weeks	are	the	period	of	the	most	rapid	development	of	the	fetus	.
if	the	fetus	continues	to	grow	at	this	speed	for	the	entire	nine	months	,	it	would	be	1.5	tons	at	birth	.
45	days	embryo	's	heart	is	beating	twice	as	fast	as	the	mother	's	.
51	days	52	days	:	developing	retina	,	nose	and	fingers	the	fetus	'	continual	movement	in	the	womb	is	necessary	for	muscular	and	skeletal	growth	.
12	weeks	:	indifferent	penis	--	girl	or	boy	yet	to	be	determined	8	months	delivery	:	the	expulsion	stage	the	moment	of	birth	alexander	tsiaras	:	thank	you	.
but	as	you	can	see	,	when	you	actually	start	working	on	this	data	,	it	's	pretty	spectacular	.
and	as	we	kept	on	scanning	more	and	more	,	working	on	this	project	,	looking	at	these	two	simple	cells	that	have	this	kind	of	unbelievable	machinery	that	will	become	the	magic	of	you	.
and	as	we	kept	on	working	on	this	data	,	looking	at	small	clusters	of	the	body	,	these	little	pieces	of	tissue	that	were	a	trophoblast	coming	off	of	a	blastocyst	,	all	of	a	sudden	burrowing	itself	into	the	side	of	the	uterus	,	saying	,	``	i	'm	here	to	stay	.	``
all	of	a	sudden	having	conversation	and	communications	with	the	estrogens	,	the	progesterones	,	saying	,	``	i	'm	here	to	stay	,	plant	me	,	``	building	this	incredible	trilinear	fetus	that	becomes	,	within	44	days	,	something	that	you	can	recognize	,	and	then	at	nine	weeks	is	really	kind	of	a	little	human	being	.
the	marvel	of	this	information	:	how	do	we	actually	have	this	biological	mechanism	inside	our	body	to	actually	see	this	information	?
i	'm	going	to	show	you	something	pretty	unique	.
here	's	a	human	heart	at	25	[	weeks	]	.
it	's	just	basically	two	strands	.
and	like	this	magnificent	origami	,	cells	are	developing	at	one	million	cells	per	second	at	four	weeks	,	as	it	's	just	folding	on	itself	.
within	five	weeks	,	you	can	start	to	see	the	early	atrium	and	the	early	ventricles	.
six	weeks	,	these	folds	are	now	beginning	with	the	papilla	on	the	inside	of	the	heart	actually	being	able	to	pull	down	each	one	of	those	valves	in	your	heart	until	you	get	a	mature	heart	--	and	then	basically	the	development	of	the	entire	human	body	.
the	magic	of	the	mechanisms	inside	each	genetic	structure	saying	exactly	where	that	nerve	cell	should	go	--	the	complexity	of	these	mathematical	models	of	how	these	things	are	indeed	done	are	beyond	human	comprehension	.
even	though	i	am	a	mathematician	,	i	look	at	this	with	marvel	of	how	do	these	instruction	sets	not	make	these	mistakes	as	they	build	what	is	us	?
it	's	a	mystery	,	it	's	magic	,	it	's	divinity	.
then	you	start	to	take	a	look	at	adult	life	.
take	a	look	at	this	little	tuft	of	capillaries	.
it	's	just	a	tiny	sub	-	substructure	,	microscopic	.
but	basically	by	the	time	you	're	nine	months	and	you	're	given	birth	,	you	have	almost	60,000	miles	of	vessels	inside	your	body	.
i	mean	,	and	only	one	mile	is	visible	.
59,999	miles	that	are	basically	bringing	nutrients	and	taking	waste	away	.
the	complexity	of	building	that	within	a	single	system	is	,	again	,	beyond	any	comprehension	or	any	existing	mathematics	today	.
and	that	instruction	set	,	from	the	brain	to	every	other	part	of	the	body	--	look	at	the	complexity	of	the	folding	.
where	does	this	intelligence	of	knowing	that	a	fold	can	actually	hold	more	information	,	so	as	you	actually	watch	the	baby	's	brain	grow	--	and	this	is	one	of	the	things	that	we	're	doing	right	now	.
we	're	actually	doing	the	launch	of	two	new	studies	of	actually	scanning	babies	'	brains	from	the	moment	they	're	born	.
every	six	months	until	they	're	six	years	old	--	we	're	going	to	be	doing	actually	to	about	250	children	--	watching	exactly	how	the	gyri	and	the	sulci	of	the	brains	fold	to	see	how	this	magnificent	development	actually	turns	into	memories	and	the	marvel	that	is	us	.
and	it	's	not	just	our	own	existence	,	but	how	does	the	woman	's	body	understand	to	have	genetic	structure	that	not	only	builds	her	own	,	but	then	has	the	understanding	that	allows	her	to	become	a	walking	immunological	,	cardiovascular	system	that	basically	is	a	mobile	system	that	can	actually	nurture	,	treat	this	child	with	a	kind	of	marvel	that	is	beyond	,	again	,	our	comprehension	--	the	magic	that	is	existence	,	that	is	us	?
thank	you	.
