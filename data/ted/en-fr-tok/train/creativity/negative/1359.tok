i	would	like	to	talk	to	you	about	why	many	e-health	projects	fail	.
and	i	really	think	that	the	most	important	thing	of	it	is	that	we	stopped	listening	to	patients	.
and	one	of	the	things	we	did	at	_UNK_	university	is	we	appointed	a	chief	listening	officer	.
not	in	a	very	scientific	way	--	she	puts	up	a	little	cup	of	coffee	or	cup	of	tea	and	asks	patients	,	family	,	relatives	,	``	what	's	up	?
how	could	we	help	you	?	``	and	we	think	,	we	like	to	think	,	that	this	is	one	of	the	major	problems	why	all	--	maybe	not	all	--	but	most	of	the	e-health	projects	fail	,	since	we	stopped	listening	.
this	is	my	wifi	scale	.	it	's	a	very	simple	thing	.
it	's	got	one	knob	,	on	/	off	.
and	every	morning	i	hop	on	it	.
and	yes	,	i	've	got	a	challenge	,	as	you	might	see	.
and	i	put	my	challenge	on	95	kg	.
but	the	thing	is	that	it	's	made	this	simple	that	whenever	i	hop	on	,	it	sends	my	data	through	google	health	as	well	.
and	it	's	collected	by	my	general	practitioner	as	well	,	so	he	can	see	what	's	my	problem	in	weight	,	not	on	the	very	moment	that	i	need	_UNK_	support	or	something	like	it	,	but	also	looking	backward	.
but	there	's	another	thing	.
as	some	of	you	might	know	,	i	've	got	more	than	4,000	followers	on	twitter	.
so	every	morning	i	hop	on	my	wifi	scale	and	before	i	'm	in	my	car	,	people	start	talking	to	me	,	``	i	think	you	need	a	light	lunch	today	,	lucien	.	``	but	that	's	the	nicest	thing	that	could	happen	,	since	this	is	peer	pressure	,	peer	pressure	used	to	help	patients	--	since	this	could	be	used	for	obesity	,	it	could	be	used	to	stop	smoking	in	patients	.
but	on	the	other	hand	,	it	also	could	be	used	to	get	people	from	out	of	their	chairs	and	try	to	work	together	in	some	kind	of	gaming	activity	to	get	more	control	of	their	health	.
as	of	next	week	,	it	will	soon	be	available	.
there	will	be	this	little	blood	pressure	meter	connected	to	an	iphone	or	something	or	other	.
and	people	will	be	able	,	from	their	homes	,	to	take	their	blood	pressure	,	send	it	into	their	doctor	and	eventually	share	it	with	others	,	for	instance	,	for	over	a	hundred	dollars	.
and	this	is	the	point	where	patients	get	into	position	and	can	collect	,	not	only	their	own	control	again	,	be	captain	of	their	own	ship	,	but	also	can	help	us	in	health	care	due	to	the	challenges	that	we	face	,	like	health	care	cost	explosion	,	doubled	demand	and	things	like	that	.
make	techniques	that	are	easy	to	use	and	start	with	this	to	embrace	patients	in	the	team	.
and	you	can	do	this	with	techniques	like	this	,	but	also	by	crowd	-	sourcing	.
and	one	of	the	things	we	did	i	would	like	to	share	with	you	introduced	by	a	little	video	.
we	've	all	got	navigation	controls	in	our	car	.
we	maybe	even	[	have	]	it	in	our	cellphone	.
we	know	perfectly	where	all	the	atms	are	about	the	city	of	maastricht	.
the	other	thing	is	we	know	where	all	the	gas	stations	are	.
and	sure	,	we	could	find	fast	food	chains	.
but	where	would	be	the	nearest	aed	to	help	this	patient	?
we	asked	around	and	nobody	knew	.
nobody	knew	where	the	nearest	life	-	saving	aed	was	to	be	obtained	right	now	.
so	what	we	did	,	we	crowdsourced	the	netherlands	.
we	set	up	a	website	and	asked	the	crowd	,	``	if	you	see	an	aed	,	please	submit	it	,	tell	us	where	it	is	,	tell	us	when	it	's	open	,	``	since	sometimes	in	office	hours	sometimes	it	's	closed	,	of	course	.
and	over	10,000	aeds	already	in	the	netherlands	already	have	been	submitted	.
the	next	step	we	took	was	to	find	the	applications	for	it	.
and	we	built	an	ipad	application	.
we	made	an	application	for	_UNK_	,	augmented	reality	,	to	find	these	aeds	.
and	whenever	you	are	in	a	city	like	maastricht	and	somebody	collapses	,	you	can	use	your	iphone	,	and	within	the	next	weeks	also	run	your	microsoft	cellphone	,	to	find	the	nearest	aed	which	can	save	lives	.
and	as	of	today	,	we	would	like	to	introduce	this	,	not	only	as	aed	_UNK_	,	which	is	what	the	product	is	called	,	but	also	aed	_UNK_	.
and	we	would	like	to	start	this	on	a	worldwide	level	.
and	[	we	're	]	asking	all	of	our	colleagues	in	the	rest	of	the	world	,	colleague	universities	,	to	help	us	to	find	and	work	and	act	like	a	hub	to	crowd	-	source	all	these	aeds	all	around	the	world	.
that	whenever	you	're	on	holiday	and	somebody	collapses	,	might	it	be	your	own	relative	or	someone	just	in	front	of	you	,	you	can	find	this	.
the	other	thing	we	would	like	to	ask	is	of	companies	also	all	over	the	world	that	will	be	able	to	help	us	_UNK_	these	aeds	.
these	might	be	courier	services	or	cable	guys	for	instance	,	just	to	see	whether	the	aed	that	's	submitted	still	is	in	place	.
so	please	help	us	on	this	one	and	try	to	make	not	only	health	a	little	bit	better	,	but	take	control	of	it	.
thank	you	.
