i	'll	tell	you	a	little	bit	about	irrational	behavior	.
not	yours	,	of	course	--	other	people	's	.
so	after	being	at	mit	for	a	few	years	,	i	realized	that	writing	academic	papers	is	not	that	exciting	.
you	know	,	i	do	n't	know	how	many	of	those	you	read	,
but	it	's	not	fun	to	read	and	often	not	fun	to	write	--
even	worse	to	write	.
so	i	decided	to	try	and	write	something	more	fun	.
and	i	came	up	with	an	idea	that	i	will	write	a	cookbook	.
and	the	title	for	my	cookbook	was	going	to	be	``	dining	without	crumbs	:	the	art	of	eating	over	the	sink	.	``
and	it	was	going	to	be	a	look	at	life	through	the	kitchen	.
and	i	was	quite	excited	about	this	.	i	was	going	to	talk	a	little	bit	about	research	,	a	little	bit	about	the	kitchen	.
you	know	,	we	do	so	much	in	the	kitchen	i	thought	this	would	be	interesting	.
and	i	wrote	a	couple	of	chapters	.
and	i	took	it	to	mit	press	and	they	said	,	``	cute	,	but	not	for	us	.	go	and	find	somebody	else	.	``
i	tried	other	people	and	everybody	said	the	same	thing	,	``	cute	.	not	for	us	.	``
until	somebody	said	,	``	look	,	if	you	're	serious	about	this	,	you	first	have	to	write	a	book	about	your	research	.	you	have	to	publish	something	,
and	then	you	'll	get	the	opportunity	to	write	something	else	.
if	you	really	want	to	do	it	you	have	to	do	it	.	``
so	i	said	,	``	you	know	,	i	really	do	n't	want	to	write	about	my	research	.
i	do	this	all	day	long	.	i	want	to	write	something	else	.
something	a	bit	more	free	,	less	constrained	.	``
and	this	person	was	very	forceful	and	said	,	``	look	.	that	's	the	only	way	you	'll	ever	do	it	.	``
so	i	said	,	``	okay	,	if	i	have	to	do	it	--	``	i	had	a	sabbatical	.	i	said	,	``	i	'll	write	about	my	research	if	there	is	no	other	way	.	and	then	i	'll	get	to	do	my	cookbook	.	``
so	i	wrote	a	book	on	my	research	.
and	it	turned	out	to	be	quite	fun	in	two	ways	.
first	of	all	,	i	enjoyed	writing	.
but	the	more	interesting	thing	was	that	i	started	learning	from	people	.
it	's	a	fantastic	time	to	write	,
because	there	is	so	much	feedback	you	can	get	from	people	.
people	write	me	about	their	personal	experience	,	and	about	their	examples	,	and	what	they	disagree	,	and	nuances	.
and	even	being	here	--	i	mean	the	last	few	days	,	i	've	known	really	heights	of	obsessive	behavior	i	never	thought	about	.
which	i	think	is	just	fascinating	.
i	will	tell	you	a	little	bit	about	irrational	behavior	.
and	i	want	to	start	by	giving	you	some	examples	of	visual	illusion	as	a	metaphor	for	rationality	.
so	think	about	these	two	tables	.
and	you	must	have	seen	this	illusion	.
if	i	asked	you	what	's	longer	,	the	vertical	line	on	the	table	on	the	left	,	or	the	horizontal	line	on	the	table	on	the	right	?
which	one	seems	longer	?
can	anybody	see	anything	but	the	left	one	being	longer	?
no	,	right	?	it	's	impossible	.
but	the	nice	thing	about	visual	illusion	is	we	can	easily	demonstrate	mistakes	.
so	i	can	put	some	lines	on	;	it	does	n't	help	.
i	can	animate	the	lines	.	and	to	the	extent	you	believe	i	did	n't	shrink	the	lines	,	which	i	did	n't	,	i	've	proven	to	you	that	your	eyes	were	deceiving	you	.
now	,	the	interesting	thing	about	this	is	when	i	take	the	lines	away	,	it	's	as	if	you	have	n't	learned	anything	in	the	last	minute	.
you	ca	n't	look	at	this	and	say	,	``	okay	now	i	see	reality	as	it	is	.	``
right	?	it	's	impossible	to	overcome	this	sense	that	this	is	indeed	longer	.
our	intuition	is	really	fooling	us	in	a	repeatable	,	predictable	,	consistent	way	.
and	there	is	almost	nothing	we	can	do	about	it	,	aside	from	taking	a	ruler	and	starting	to	measure	it	.
here	is	another	one	--	this	is	one	of	my	favorite	illusions	.
what	do	you	see	the	color	that	top	arrow	is	pointing	to	?
brown	.	thank	you	.
the	bottom	one	?	yellow	.
turns	out	they	're	identical	.
can	anybody	see	them	as	identical	?
very	very	hard	.
i	can	cover	the	rest	of	the	cube	up	.	and	if	i	cover	the	rest	of	the	cube	you	can	see	that	they	are	identical	.
and	if	you	do	n't	believe	me	you	can	get	the	slide	later	and	do	some	arts	and	crafts	and	see	that	they	're	identical	.
but	again	it	's	the	same	story	that	if	we	take	the	background	away	,	the	illusion	comes	back	.	right	.
there	is	no	way	for	us	not	to	see	this	illusion	.
i	guess	maybe	if	you	're	colorblind	i	do	n't	think	you	can	see	that	.
i	want	you	to	think	about	illusion	as	a	metaphor	.
vision	is	one	of	the	best	things	we	do	.
we	have	a	huge	part	of	our	brain	dedicated	to	vision	--	bigger	than	dedicated	to	anything	else	.
we	do	more	vision	more	hours	of	the	day	than	we	do	anything	else	.
and	we	are	evolutionarily	designed	to	do	vision	.
and	if	we	have	these	predictable	repeatable	mistakes	in	vision	,	which	we	're	so	good	at	,	what	's	the	chance	that	we	do	n't	make	even	more	mistakes	in	something	we	're	not	as	good	at	--
for	example	,	financial	decision	making	:
something	we	do	n't	have	an	evolutionary	reason	to	do	,	we	do	n't	have	a	specialized	part	of	the	brain	,	and	we	do	n't	do	that	many	hours	of	the	day	.
and	the	argument	is	in	those	cases	it	might	be	the	issue	that	we	actually	make	many	more	mistakes
and	,	worse	,	not	have	an	easy	way	to	see	them	.
because	in	visual	illusions	we	can	easily	demonstrate	the	mistakes	;
in	cognitive	illusion	it	's	much	,	much	harder	to	demonstrate	to	people	the	mistakes	.
so	i	want	to	show	you	some	cognitive	illusions	,	or	decision	-	making	illusions	,	in	the	same	way	.
and	this	is	one	of	my	favorite	plots	in	social	sciences	.
it	's	from	a	paper	by	johnson	and	goldstein	.
and	it	basically	shows	the	percentage	of	people	who	indicated	they	would	be	interested	in	giving	their	organs	to	donation	.
and	these	are	different	countries	in	europe	.	and	you	basically	see	two	types	of	countries	:
countries	on	the	right	,	that	seem	to	be	giving	a	lot	;	and	countries	on	the	left	that	seem	to	giving	very	little	,	or	much	less	.
the	question	is	,	why	?	why	do	some	countries	give	a	lot	and	some	countries	give	a	little	?
when	you	ask	people	this	question	,	they	usually	think	that	it	has	to	be	something	about	culture	.
right	?	how	much	do	you	care	about	people	?
giving	your	organs	to	somebody	else	is	probably	about	how	much	you	care	about	society	,	how	linked	you	are	.
or	maybe	it	is	about	religion	.
but	,	if	you	look	at	this	plot	,	you	can	see	that	countries	that	we	think	about	as	very	similar	actually	exhibit	very	different	behavior	.
for	example	,	sweden	is	all	the	way	on	the	right	,	and	denmark	,	that	we	think	is	culturally	very	similar	,	is	all	the	way	on	the	left	.
germany	is	on	the	left	.	and	austria	is	on	the	right	.
the	netherlands	is	on	the	left	.	and	belgium	is	on	the	right	.
and	finally	,	depending	on	your	particular	version	of	european	similarity	,	you	can	think	about	the	u.	k	and	france	as	either	similar	culturally	or	not	.
but	it	turns	out	that	from	organ	donation	they	are	very	different	.
by	the	way	,	the	netherlands	is	an	interesting	story	.
you	see	the	netherlands	is	kind	of	the	biggest	of	the	small	group	.
turns	out	that	they	got	to	28	percent	after	mailing	every	household	in	the	country	a	letter	begging	people	to	join	this	organ	donation	program	.
you	know	the	expression	,	``	begging	only	gets	you	so	far	``	?
it	's	28	percent	in	organ	donation	.
but	whatever	the	countries	on	the	right	are	doing	they	are	doing	a	much	better	job	than	begging	.
so	what	are	they	doing	?
turns	out	the	secret	has	to	do	with	a	form	at	the	dmv	.
and	here	is	the	story	.	the	countries	on	the	left	have	a	form	at	the	dmv	that	looks	something	like	this	.	check	the	box	below	if	you	want	to	participate	in	the	organ	donor	program	.
and	what	happens	?
people	do	n't	check	,	and	they	do	n't	join	.
the	countries	on	the	right	,	the	ones	that	give	a	lot	,	have	a	slightly	different	form	.
it	says	check	the	box	below	if	you	do	n't	want	to	participate	.
interestingly	enough	,	when	people	get	this	,	they	again	do	n't	check	--	but	now	they	join	.
now	think	about	what	this	means	.
we	wake	up	in	the	morning	and	we	feel	we	make	decisions	.
we	wake	up	in	the	morning	and	we	open	the	closet
and	we	feel	that	we	decide	what	to	wear	.
and	we	open	the	refrigerator	and	we	feel	that	we	decide	what	to	eat	.
what	this	is	actually	saying	is	that	much	of	these	decisions	are	not	residing	within	us	.
they	are	residing	in	the	person	who	is	designing	that	form	.
when	you	walk	into	the	dmv	,	the	person	who	designed	the	form	will	have	a	huge	influence	on	what	you	'll	end	up	doing	.
now	it	's	also	very	hard	to	intuit	these	results	.	think	about	it	for	yourself	.
how	many	of	you	believe	that	if	you	went	to	renew	your	license	tomorrow	,	and	you	went	to	the	dmv	,	and	you	would	encounter	one	of	these	forms	,	that	it	would	actually	change	your	own	behavior	?
very	,	very	hard	to	think	that	you	will	influence	us	.
we	can	say	,	``	oh	,	these	funny	europeans	,	of	course	it	would	influence	them	.	``
but	when	it	comes	to	us	,	we	have	such	a	feeling	that	we	are	at	the	driver	's	seat	,	we	have	such	a	feeling	that	we	are	in	control	,	and	we	are	making	the	decision	,	that	it	's	very	hard	to	even	accept	the	idea	that	we	actually	have	an	illusion	of	making	a	decision	,	rather	than	an	actual	decision	.
now	,	you	might	say	,	``	these	are	decisions	we	do	n't	care	about	.	``
in	fact	,	by	definition	,	these	are	decisions	about	something	that	will	happen	to	us	after	we	die	.
how	could	we	care	about	something	less	than	something	that	happens	after	we	die	?
so	a	standard	economist	,	someone	who	believes	in	rationality	,	would	say	,	``	you	know	what	?	the	cost	of	lifting	the	pencil	and	marking	a	v	is	higher	than	the	possible	benefit	of	the	decision	,
so	that	's	why	we	get	this	effect	.	``
but	,	in	fact	,	it	's	not	because	it	's	easy	.
it	's	not	because	it	's	trivial	.	it	's	not	because	we	do	n't	care	.
it	's	the	opposite	.	it	's	because	we	care	.
it	's	difficult	and	it	's	complex	.	and	it	's	so	complex	that	we	do	n't	know	what	to	do	.
and	because	we	have	no	idea	what	to	do	we	just	pick	whatever	it	was	that	was	chosen	for	us	.
i	'll	give	you	one	more	example	for	this	.
this	is	from	a	paper	by	redelmeier	and	schaefer	.
and	they	said	,	``	well	,	this	effect	also	happens	to	experts	,	people	who	are	well	-	paid	,	experts	in	their	decisions	,	do	it	a	lot	.	``
and	they	basically	took	a	group	of	physicians	.	and	they	presented	to	them	a	case	study	of	a	patient	.
here	is	a	patient	.	he	is	a	67	-	year	-	old	farmer	.
he	's	been	suffering	from	a	right	hip	pain	for	a	while	.
and	then	they	said	to	the	physician	,	``	you	decided	a	few	weeks	ago	that	nothing	is	working	for	this	patient	.
all	these	medications	,	nothing	seems	to	be	working	.
so	you	refer	the	patient	to	hip	replacement	therapy	.
hip	replacement	.	okay	?	``
so	the	patient	is	on	a	path	to	have	his	hip	replaced	.
and	then	they	said	to	half	the	physicians	,	they	said	,	``	yesterday	you	reviewed	the	patient	's	case	and	you	realized	that	you	forgot	to	try	one	medication	.
you	did	not	try	ibuprofen	.
what	do	you	do	?	do	you	pull	the	patient	back	and	try	ibuprofen	?
or	do	you	let	them	go	and	have	hip	replacement	?	``
well	the	good	news	is	that	most	physicians	in	this	case	decided	to	pull	the	patient	and	try	the	ibuprofen	.
very	good	for	the	physicians	.
the	other	group	of	the	physicians	,	they	said	,	``	yesterday	when	you	reviewed	the	case	you	discovered	there	were	two	medications	you	did	n't	try	out	yet	,	ibuprofen	and	piroxicam	.	``
and	they	said	,	``	you	have	two	medications	you	did	n't	try	out	yet	.	what	do	you	do	?
you	let	them	go	.	or	you	pull	them	back	.
and	if	you	pull	them	back	do	you	try	ibuprofen	or	piroxicam	?	which	one	?	``
now	think	of	it	.	this	decision	makes	it	as	easy	to	let	the	patient	continue	with	hip	replacement	.	but	pulling	them	back	,	all	of	the	sudden	becomes	more	complex	.
there	is	one	more	decision	.
what	happens	now	?
majority	of	the	physicians	now	choose	to	let	the	patient	go	to	hip	replacement	.
i	hope	this	worries	you	,	by	the	way	--	when	you	go	to	see	your	physician	.
the	thing	is	is	that	no	physician	would	ever	say	,	``	piroxicam	,	ibuprofen	,	hip	replacement	.
let	's	go	for	hip	replacement	.	``
but	the	moment	you	set	this	as	the	default	it	has	a	huge	power	over	whatever	people	end	up	doing	.
i	'll	give	you	a	couple	of	more	examples	on	irrational	decision	-	making	.
imagine	i	give	you	a	choice	.	do	you	want	to	go	for	a	weekend	to	rome	?
all	expenses	paid	:	hotel	,	transportation	,	food	,	breakfast	,	a	continental	breakfast	,	everything	.
or	a	weekend	in	paris	?
now	,	a	weekend	in	paris	,	a	weekend	in	rome	,	these	are	different	things	;
they	have	different	food	,	different	culture	,	different	art	.
now	imagine	i	added	a	choice	to	the	set	that	nobody	wanted	.
imagine	i	said	,	``	a	weekend	in	rome	,	a	weekend	in	paris	,	or	having	your	car	stolen	?	``
it	's	a	funny	idea	,	because	why	would	having	your	car	stolen	,	in	this	set	,	influence	anything	?
but	what	if	the	option	to	have	your	car	stolen	was	not	exactly	like	this	.
what	if	it	was	a	trip	to	rome	,	all	expenses	paid	,	transportation	,	breakfast	,	but	does	n't	include	coffee	in	the	morning	.
if	you	want	coffee	you	have	to	pay	for	it	yourself	.	it	's	two	euros	50	.
now	in	some	ways	,	given	that	you	can	have	rome	with	coffee	,	why	would	you	possibly	want	rome	without	coffee	?
it	's	like	having	your	car	stolen	.	it	's	an	inferior	option	.
but	guess	what	happened	.	the	moment	you	add	rome	without	coffee	,	rome	with	coffee	becomes	more	popular	.	and	people	choose	it	.
the	fact	that	you	have	rome	without	coffee	makes	rome	with	coffee	look	superior	,
and	not	just	to	rome	without	coffee	--	even	superior	to	paris	.
here	are	two	examples	of	this	principle	.
this	was	an	ad	from	the	economist	a	few	years	ago	that	gave	us	three	choices	.	an	online	subscription	for	59	dollars	.	a	print	subscription	for	_UNK_	or	you	could	get	both	for	125	.
now	i	looked	at	this	and	i	called	up	the	economist	.
and	i	tried	to	figure	out	what	were	they	thinking	.
and	they	passed	me	from	one	person	to	another	to	another	,	until	eventually	i	got	to	a	person	who	was	in	charge	of	the	website	.
and	i	called	them	up	.	and	they	went	to	check	what	was	going	on	.
the	next	thing	i	know	,	the	ad	is	gone	.	and	no	explanation	.
so	i	decided	to	do	the	experiment	that	i	would	have	loved	the	economist	to	do	with	me	.
i	took	this	and	i	gave	it	to	100	mit	students	.
i	said	,	``	what	would	you	choose	?	``
these	are	the	market	share	.	most	people	wanted	the	combo	deal	.
thankfully	nobody	wanted	the	dominated	option	.	that	means	our	students	can	read	.
but	now	if	you	have	an	option	that	nobody	wants	,	you	can	take	it	off	.	right	?
so	i	printed	another	version	of	this	,	where	i	eliminated	the	middle	option	.
i	gave	it	to	another	100	students	.	here	is	what	happens	.
now	the	most	popular	option	became	the	least	popular	.	and	the	least	popular	became	the	most	popular	.
what	was	happening	was	the	option	that	was	useless	,	in	the	middle	,	was	useless	in	the	sense	that	nobody	wanted	it	.
but	it	was	n't	useless	in	the	sense	that	it	helped	people	figure	out	what	they	wanted	.
in	fact	,	relative	to	the	option	in	the	middle	,	which	was	get	only	the	print	for	125	,	the	print	and	web	for	125	looked	like	a	fantastic	deal	.	and	as	a	consequence	,	people	chose	it	.
the	general	idea	here	,	by	the	way	,	is	that	we	actually	do	n't	know	our	preferences	that	well	.
and	because	we	do	n't	know	our	preferences	that	well	we	're	susceptible	to	all	of	these	influences	from	the	external	forces	:
the	defaults	,	the	particular	options	that	are	presented	to	us	,	and	so	on	.
one	more	example	of	this	.	people	believe	that	when	we	deal	with	physical	attraction	,	we	see	somebody	,	and	we	know	immediately	whether	we	like	them	or	not	,
attracted	or	not	.
which	is	why	we	have	these	four	-	minute	dates	.
so	i	decided	to	do	this	experiment	with	people	.
i	'll	show	you	graphic	images	of	people	--	not	real	people	.	the	experiment	was	with	people	.
i	showed	some	people	a	picture	of	tom	,	and	a	picture	of	jerry	.
i	said	``	who	do	you	want	to	date	?	tom	or	jerry	?	``
but	for	half	the	people	i	added	an	ugly	version	of	jerry	.
i	took	photoshop	and	i	made	jerry	slightly	less	attractive	.
the	other	people	,	i	added	an	ugly	version	of	tom	.
and	the	question	was	,	will	ugly	jerry	and	ugly	tom	help	their	respective	,	more	attractive	brothers	?
the	answer	was	absolutely	yes	.
when	ugly	jerry	was	around	,	jerry	was	popular	.	when	ugly	tom	was	around	,	tom	was	popular	.
this	of	course	has	two	very	clear	implications	for	life	in	general	.
if	you	ever	go	bar	hopping	,	who	do	you	want	to	take	with	you	?
you	want	a	slightly	uglier	version	of	yourself	.
similar	.	similar	...	but	slightly	uglier	.
the	second	point	,	or	course	,	is	that	if	somebody	else	invites	you	,	you	know	how	they	think	about	you	.
now	you	're	getting	it	.	what	is	the	general	point	?
the	general	point	is	that	when	we	think	about	economics	we	have	this	beautiful	view	of	human	nature	.
``	what	a	piece	of	work	is	man	!	how	noble	in	reason	!	``
we	have	this	view	of	ourselves	,	of	others	.
the	behavioral	economics	perspective	is	slightly	less	generous	to	people	.
in	fact	in	medical	terms	,	that	's	our	view	.
but	there	is	a	silver	lining	.
the	silver	lining	is	,	i	think	,	kind	of	the	reason	that	behavioral	economics	is	interesting	and	exciting	.
are	we	superman	?	or	are	we	homer	simpson	?
when	it	comes	to	building	the	physical	world	,	we	kind	of	understand	our	limitations	.
we	build	steps	.	and	we	build	these	things	that	not	everybody	can	use	obviously	.
we	understand	our	limitations	,	and	we	build	around	it	.
but	for	some	reason	when	it	comes	to	the	mental	world	,	when	we	design	things	like	healthcare	and	retirement	and	stockmarkets	,	we	somehow	forget	the	idea	that	we	are	limited	.
i	think	that	if	we	understood	our	cognitive	limitations	in	the	same	way	that	we	understand	our	physical	limitations	,	even	though	they	do	n't	stare	us	in	the	face	in	the	same	way	,	we	could	design	a	better	world	.
and	that	,	i	think	,	is	the	hope	of	this	thing	.
thank	you	very	much	.
