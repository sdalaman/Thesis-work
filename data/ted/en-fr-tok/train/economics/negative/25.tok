i	'm	rich	baraniuk	.
and	what	i	'd	like	to	talk	a	little	bit	about	today	are	some	ideas	that	i	think	have	just	tremendous	resonance	with	all	the	things	that	have	been	talked	about	the	last	two	days	.
in	fact	,	so	many	different	points	of	resonance	that	it	's	going	to	be	difficult	to	bring	them	all	up	,	but	i	'll	try	to	do	my	best	.
does	anybody	remember	these	?
ok	,	so	these	are	lp	records	and	they	've	been	replaced	,	right	?
they	've	been	swept	away	over	the	last	two	decades	by	these	types	of	world	-	flattening	digitization	technologies	,	right	?
and	i	think	it	was	best	witnessed	when	thomas	was	playing	the	music	as	we	came	in	the	room	today	.
what	's	happened	in	the	music	world	is	there	's	a	culture	or	an	ecosystem	that	's	been	created	that	,	if	you	take	some	words	from	apple	,	the	catchphrase	that	we	create	,	rip	,	mix	and	burn	.
what	i	mean	by	that	is	that	anyone	in	the	world	is	free	and	allowed	to	create	new	music	and	musical	ideas	.
anyone	in	the	world	is	allowed	to	rip	or	copy	musical	ideas	,	use	them	in	innovative	ways	.
anyone	is	allowed	to	mix	them	in	different	types	of	ways	,	draw	connections	between	musical	ideas	and	people	can	burn	them	or	create	final	products	and	continue	the	circle	.
and	what	that	's	done	is	it	's	created	,	like	i	said	,	a	vibrant	community	that	's	very	inclusive	with	people	continually	working	to	connect	musical	ideas	,	innovate	them	and	keep	things	constantly	up	to	date	.
today	's	hit	single	is	not	last	year	's	hit	single	.
but	,	i	'm	not	here	to	talk	about	music	today	.
i	'm	here	to	talk	about	books	.
in	particular	,	textbooks	and	the	kind	of	educational	materials	that	we	use	every	day	in	school	.
has	anyone	here	ever	been	to	school	?
ok	,	does	anybody	realize	there	's	a	crisis	in	our	schools	,	around	the	world	?
ok	,	i	'm	not	going	to	spend	too	much	time	on	that	,	but	what	i	want	to	talk	about	is	some	of	the	disconnects	that	appear	when	an	author	publishes	a	book	that	in	fact	,	the	publishing	process	--	just	because	of	the	fact	that	it	's	complicated	,	it	's	heavy	,	books	are	expensive	--	creates	a	sort	of	a	wall	between	authors	of	books	and	the	ultimate	users	of	books	,	be	they	teachers	,	students	or	just	general	readers	.
and	this	is	even	more	true	if	you	happen	to	speak	a	language	other	than	one	of	the	world	's	major	languages	,	and	especially	english	.
and	i	'm	going	to	call	these	people	below	the	barrier	shut	-	outs	,	because	they	're	really	shut	out	of	the	process	of	being	able	to	share	their	knowledge	with	the	world	.
and	so	what	i	want	to	talk	about	today	is	trying	to	take	these	ideas	that	we	've	seen	in	the	musical	culture	and	try	to	bring	these	towards	reinventing	the	way	we	think	about	writing	books	,	using	them	and	teaching	from	them	.
so	,	that	's	what	i	'd	like	to	talk	about	and	really	,	how	do	we	get	from	where	we	are	now	to	where	we	need	to	go	?
so	,	the	first	thing	i	'd	like	you	to	do	is	a	little	thought	experiment	.
so	,	imagine	taking	all	the	world	's	books	.
ok	,	everybody	imagine	books	and	imagine	just	tearing	out	the	pages	.
so	,	liberating	these	pages	and	imagine	digitizing	them	and	then	storing	them	in	a	vast	,	interconnected	,	global	repository	.
think	of	it	as	a	massive	itunes	for	book	type	content	.
and	then	take	that	material	and	imagine	making	it	all	open	,	so	that	people	can	modify	it	,	play	with	it	,	improve	it	.
imagine	making	it	free	,	so	that	anyone	in	the	world	can	have	access	to	all	of	this	knowledge	,	and	imagine	using	information	technology	so	that	you	can	update	this	content	,	improve	it	,	play	with	it	,	on	a	timescale	that	's	more	on	the	order	of	seconds	instead	of	years	.
instead	of	editions	coming	out	every	two	years	,	of	a	book	,	imagine	it	coming	out	every	25	seconds	.
so	,	imagine	we	could	do	that	and	imagine	we	could	put	people	into	this	.
so	that	we	could	truly	build	an	ecosystem	with	not	just	authors	,	but	all	the	people	who	could	be	or	want	to	be	authors	in	all	the	different	languages	of	the	world	,	and	i	think	if	you	could	do	this	,	it	would	be	called	,	well	,	i	'm	just	going	to	refer	to	it	as	a	knowledge	ecosystem	.
so	,	really	,	this	is	the	dream	and	in	a	sense	what	you	can	think	of	it	is	we	are	trying	to	enable	anyone	in	the	world	,	i	mean	anyone	in	the	world	,	to	be	their	own	educational	dj	,
creating	educational	materials	,	sharing	them	with	the	world	,	constantly	innovating	on	them	.	so	,	this	is	the	dream	.
in	fact	,	this	dream	is	actually	being	realized	.
over	the	last	six	-	and	-	a	-	half	years	,	we	've	been	working	really	hard	at	rice	university	on	a	project	called	connexions	,	and	so	what	i	'd	like	to	do	for	the	rest	of	the	talk	is	just	tell	you	a	little	bit	about	what	people	are	doing	with	connexions	,	which	you	can	kind	of	think	of	as	the	counterpoint	to	nicholas	negroponte	's	talk	yesterday	,	where	they	're	working	on	the	hardware	of	bringing	education	to	the	world	.
we	're	working	on	the	open	-	source	tools	and	the	content	.
so	,	that	's	sort	of	to	put	it	in	perspective	here	.
so	,	create	.	so	what	are	some	of	the	people	that	are	using	these	kind	of	tools	?
well	,	the	first	thing	is	there	's	a	community	of	engineering	professors	,	from	cambridge	to	kyoto	,	who	are	developing	engineering	content	in	electrical	engineering	to	develop	what	you	can	think	of	as	a	massive	,	super	textbook	that	covers	the	entire	area	of	electrical	engineering	--	and	not	only	that	,	it	can	be	customized	for	use	in	each	of	their	own	individual	institutions	.
if	people	like	kitty	jones	--	right	,	a	shut	-	out	--	a	private	music	teacher	and	mom	from	champagne	,	illinois	,	who	wanted	to	share	her	fantastic	music	content	with	the	world	,	on	how	to	teach	kids	how	to	play	music	.
her	material	is	now	used	over	600,000	times	per	month	.
tremendous	,	tremendous	use	.
in	fact	,	a	lot	of	this	use	coming	from	unites	states	,	k	-	through	-	12	schools	because	anyone	who	's	involved	in	a	school	scale	back	,	the	first	thing	that	's	cut	is	the	music	curriculum	and	so	this	is	just	indicating	the	tremendous	thirst	for	this	kind	of	open	,	free	content	.
a	lot	of	teachers	are	using	this	stuff	.	ok	,	what	about	ripping	?
what	about	copying	,	reusing	,	right	?
a	team	of	volunteers	at	the	university	of	texas	el	paso	,	graduate	students	translating	this	engineering	super	textbook	ideas	and	within	about	a	week	,	having	this	be	some	of	our	most	popular	material	in	widespread	use	all	over	latin	america	and	in	particular	in	mexico	,	because	of	the	open	extensible	nature	of	this	.
people	,	volunteers	and	even	companies	that	are	translating	material	into	asian	languages	like	chinese	,	japanese	and	thai	,	to	spread	the	knowledge	even	further	.
ok	,	what	about	people	who	are	mixing	?	what	does	``	mixing	``	mean	?
``	mixing	``	means	building	customized	courses	,	means	building	customized	books	.
companies	like	national	instruments	,	who	are	embedding	very	powerful	,	interactive	simulations	into	the	materials	,	so	that	we	can	go	way	beyond	our	regular	kind	of	textbook	to	an	experience	that	all	the	teaching	materials	are	things	you	can	actually	interact	with	and	play	around	with	and	actually	learn	as	you	do	.
we	've	been	working	with	teachers	without	borders	who	are	very	interested	in	mixing	our	materials	.
they	're	going	to	be	using	connexions	as	their	platform	to	develop	and	deliver	teaching	materials	for	teaching	teachers	how	to	teach	in	84	countries	that	are	around	the	world	.
twb	is	currently	in	iraq	training	20,000	teachers	supported	by	usaid	and	to	them	,	this	idea	of	being	able	to	remix	and	customize	to	the	local	context	is	extraordinarily	important	,	because	just	providing	free	content	to	people	has	actually	been	likened	by	people	in	the	developing	world	to	a	kind	of	cultural	imperialism	,	that	if	you	do	n't	empower	people	with	the	ability	to	re	-	contextualize	the	material	,	translate	it	into	their	own	language	and	take	ownership	of	it	,	it	's	not	good	.
ok	,	other	organizations	we	've	been	working	with	,	uc	merced	,	people	know	about	uc	merced	.
it	's	a	new	university	in	california	,	in	the	central	valley	,	working	very	closely	with	community	colleges	.
they	're	actually	developing	a	lot	of	their	science	and	engineering	curriculum	to	spread	widely	around	the	world	in	our	system	and	they	're	also	trying	to	develop	all	of	their	software	tools	completely	open	-	source	.
we	've	been	working	with	amd	,	which	has	a	project	called	50	by	'15	,	which	is	trying	to	bring	internet	connectivity	to	50	percent	of	the	world	's	population	by	2015	.
we	're	going	to	be	providing	content	to	them	in	a	whole	range	of	different	languages	.	and	we	've	also	been	working	with	a	number	of	other	organizations	.
in	particular	,	a	bunch	of	the	projects	that	are	funded	by	hewlett	foundation	,	who	have	taken	a	real	leadership	role	in	this	area	of	open	content	.
ok	,	burn	,	i	think	this	is	sort	of	,	quite	interesting	.
``	burn	``	is	the	idea	of	trying	to	create	the	physical	instantiation	of	one	of	these	courses	.	and	i	think	a	lot	of	you	received	,	i	think	all	of	you	received	one	of	these	music	books	in	your	gift	pack	.
a	little	present	for	you	.
just	to	tell	you	quickly	about	it	:	this	is	an	engineering	textbook	.
it	's	about	300	pages	long	,	hardbound	.
this	costs	,	anybody	guess	?
how	much	would	it	cost	in	a	bookstore	?
audience	:	65	dollars	.
richard	baraniuk	:	this	costs	22	dollars	to	the	student	.
why	does	it	cost	22	dollars	?
because	it	's	published	on	demand	and	it	's	developed	from	this	repository	of	open	materials	.
if	this	book	were	to	be	published	by	a	regular	publisher	,	it	would	cost	at	least	122	dollars	.
so	what	we	're	seeing	is	moving	this	burning	or	publication	process	from	the	regular	sort	of	single	-	authored	book	towards	community	-	authored	materials	that	are	modular	,	that	are	customized	to	each	individual	class	and	published	on	demand	very	inexpensively	,	either	pushed	out	through	amazon	,	or	published	directly	through	an	on	-	demand	press	,	like	coop	.
and	i	think	that	this	is	an	extraordinarily	interesting	area	because	there	is	tremendous	area	under	this	long	tail	in	publishing	.
we	're	not	talking	about	the	harry	potter	end	,	right	at	the	left	side	.
we	're	talking	about	books	on	hyper	geometric	partial	differential	equations	.
right	,	books	that	might	sell	100	copies	a	year	,	1,000	copies	a	year	.
there	is	tremendous	sustaining	revenue	under	this	long	tail	to	sustain	open	projects	like	ours	,	but	also	to	sustain	this	new	emergence	of	on	-	demand	publishers	,	like	coop	,	who	produced	these	two	books	.	and	i	think	one	of	the	things	that	you	should	take	away	from	this	talk	,	is	that	there	's	an	impending	cut	-	out	-	the	-	middle	-	man	,	disintermediation	,	that	's	going	to	be	happening	in	the	publishing	industry	,	and	it	's	going	to	reach	a	crescendo	over	the	next	few	years	,	and	i	think	that	it	's	for	our	benefit	,	really	,	and	for	the	world	's	benefit	.
ok	,	so	what	are	the	enablers	?
what	's	really	making	all	of	this	happen	?
there	's	tons	of	technology	,	and	the	only	piece	of	technology	that	i	really	want	to	talk	about	is	xml	.
how	many	people	know	about	xml	?
oh	,	great	,	so	it	's	the	future	of	the	web	,	right	?
it	's	semantic	representation	of	comment	,	content	,	and	what	you	can	really	think	of	xml	in	this	case	,	is	it	's	the	packaging	that	we	're	putting	around	these	pages	.
remember	we	took	the	book	,	tore	the	pages	out	?
well	,	what	the	xml	is	going	to	do	is	it	's	going	to	turn	those	pages	into	lego	blocks	.
xml	are	the	nubs	on	the	lego	that	allow	us	to	combine	the	content	together	in	myriad	different	ways	,	and	it	provides	us	a	framework	to	share	content	.
so	,	it	lets	you	take	this	ecosystem	in	its	primordial	state	,	right	,	of	all	this	content	,	all	the	pages	you	've	torn	out	of	books	,	and	create	highly	sophisticated	learning	machines	:
books	,	courses	,	course	packs	.
it	gives	you	the	ability	to	personalize	the	learning	experience	to	each	individual	student	,	so	that	every	student	can	have	a	book	or	a	course	that	's	customized	to	their	learning	style	,	their	context	,	their	language	and	the	things	that	excite	them	.
it	lets	you	reuse	the	same	materials	in	multiple	different	ways	and	surprising	new	ways	.
it	lets	you	interconnect	ideas	indicating	how	fields	relate	to	each	other	,	and	i	'll	just	give	you	my	personal	story	.
we	came	up	with	this	six	-	and	-	a	-	half	years	ago	because	i	teach	the	stuff	in	the	red	box	.
and	my	day	job	,	as	chris	said	,	i	'm	an	electrical	engineering	professor	.
i	teach	signal	processing	and	my	challenge	was	to	show	that	this	math	--	wow	,	about	half	of	you	have	already	fallen	asleep	just	looking	at	the	equation	--	but	this	seemingly	dry	math	is	actually	the	center	of	this	tremendously	powerful	web	that	links	technology	--	that	links	really	cool	applications	like	music	synthesizers	to	tremendous	economic	opportunities	,	but	also	governed	by	intellectual	property	.
and	the	thing	that	i	realized	is	there	was	no	way	that	i	,	as	an	engineer	,	could	write	this	book	that	would	get	all	of	this	across	.
we	needed	a	community	to	do	it	and	we	needed	new	tools	to	be	able	to	interconnect	these	ideas	,	and	i	think	that	really	,	in	a	sense	,	what	we	're	trying	to	do	is	make	minsky	's	dream	come	to	a	reality	,	where	you	can	imagine	all	the	books	in	a	library	actually	starting	to	talk	to	each	other	.	and	people	who	are	teachers	out	here	,	whoever	taught	,	you	know	this	--
it	's	the	interconnections	between	ideas	that	teaching	is	really	all	about	.
ok	,	back	to	math	.	imagine	this	is	possible	--
that	every	single	equation	that	you	click	on	in	one	of	your	new	e-texts	is	something	that	you	're	going	to	be	able	to	explore	and	experiment	with	.
so	imagine	your	kid	's	algebra	textbook	in	seventh	grade	.
you	can	click	on	every	single	equation	and	bring	up	a	little	tool	to	be	able	to	experiment	with	it	,	tinker	with	it	,	understand	it	,	because	we	really	do	n't	understand	until	we	do	.
the	same	type	of	mark	-	up	,	like	mathml	,	for	chemistry	.
imagine	chemistry	textbooks	that	actually	understand	the	structure	of	how	molecules	are	formed	.
imagine	music	xml	that	actually	lets	you	delve	into	the	semantic	structure	of	music	,	play	with	it	,	understand	it	.
it	's	no	wonder	that	everybody	's	getting	into	it	,	right	?
even	the	three	wise	men	.
ok	,	the	second	big	enabler	,	and	this	is	where	i	told	a	big	lie	.
the	second	big	enabler	is	intellectual	property	,	because	in	fact	i	got	up	here	and	i	talked	about	how	great	the	music	culture	is	.
we	can	share	and	rip	,	mix	and	burn	,	but	in	fact	that	's	all	illegal	.
and	we	would	be	accused	of	pirates	for	doing	that	,	because	this	music	has	been	propertized	.
it	's	now	owned	,	right	,	much	of	it	by	big	industries	.
so	,	really	,	the	key	thing	here	is	we	ca	n't	let	this	happen	.
we	ca	n't	let	this	napster	thing	happen	here	.	so	,	what	we	have	to	do	is	get	it	right	from	the	very	beginning	and	what	we	have	to	do	is	find	an	intellectual	property	framework	that	makes	sharing	safe	,	and	makes	it	easily	understandable	,	and	the	inspiration	here	is	taken	from	open	-	source	software	,	things	like	linux	and	the	gpl	.
and	the	ideas	,	the	creative	commons	licenses	.
how	many	people	have	heard	of	creative	commons	?
if	you	have	not	,	you	must	learn	about	it	.	creativecommons.org	.
at	the	bottom	of	every	piece	of	material	in	connexions	and	in	lots	of	other	projects	,	you	can	find	their	logo	.
clicking	on	that	logo	takes	you	to	an	absolute	no	-	nonsense	,	human	-	readable	document	,	a	deed	,	that	tells	you	exactly	what	you	can	do	with	this	content	.
in	fact	,	you	're	free	to	share	it	,	to	do	all	of	these	things	,	to	copy	it	,	to	change	it	,	even	to	make	commercial	use	of	it	as	long	as	you	attribute	the	author	.
because	in	academic	publishing	and	much	of	educational	publishing	,	it	's	really	this	idea	of	sharing	knowledge	and	making	impact	that	's	why	people	write	,	not	necessarily	making	bucks	.
we	're	not	talking	about	harry	potter	,	right	?	we	're	at	the	long	tail	end	here	.
behind	that	is	the	legal	code	,	so	if	you	want	to	very	carefully	construct	it	,	and	creative	commons	is	taking	off	--
over	43	million	things	out	there	,	licensed	with	a	creative	commons	license	.
not	just	text	,	but	music	,	images	,	video	,	and	there	's	actually	a	tremendous	uptake	of	the	number	of	people	that	are	actually	licensing	music	to	make	it	free	for	people	who	do	this	whole	idea	of	re	-	sampling	,	rip	,	mixing	,	burning	and	sharing	.
so	i	'd	like	to	conclude	with	just	the	last	few	points	.
so	,	we	've	built	this	idea	of	a	commons	.	people	are	using	it	.
we	get	over	500,000	unique	visitors	per	month	,	just	to	our	particular	site	.
mit	open	courseware	,	which	is	another	large	open	-	content	site	,	gets	a	similar	number	of	hits	,	but	how	do	we	protect	this	?
how	do	we	protect	it	into	the	future	?	and	the	first	thing	that	people	are	probably	thinking	is	quality	control	,	right	?
because	we	're	saying	that	anybody	can	contribute	things	to	this	commons	.	anybody	can	contribute	anything	.	so	that	could	be	a	problem	.
it	did	n't	take	long	until	people	started	contributing	materials	,	for	example	,	on	lingerie	,	which	is	actually	a	pretty	good	module	.
the	only	problem	is	it	's	plagiarized	from	a	major	french	feminist	journal	,	and	when	you	go	to	the	supposed	course	website	,	it	points	to	a	lingerie	-	selling	website	.
this	is	a	little	bit	of	a	problem	,	so	we	clearly	need	some	kind	of	idea	of	quality	control	,	and	this	is	really	where	the	idea	of	review	and	peer	review	comes	in	.
ok	,	you	come	to	ted	.	why	do	you	come	to	ted	?
because	chris	and	his	team	have	ensured	that	things	are	very	,	very	high	quality	,	right	,	and	so	we	need	to	be	able	to	do	the	same	thing	.
and	we	need	to	be	able	to	design	structures	and	what	we	're	doing	is	designing	social	software	to	enable	anyone	to	build	their	own	peer	review	process	,	and	we	call	these	things	``	lenses	.	``	and	basically	what	they	allow	is	anyone	out	there	to	develop	their	own	peer	review	process	,	so	that	they	can	focus	on	the	content	in	the	repository	that	they	think	is	really	important	and	you	can	think	of	ted	as	a	potential	lens	.
so	i	'd	just	like	to	end	by	saying	,	you	can	really	view	this	as	a	call	to	action	.
connexions	and	open	content	is	all	about	sharing	knowledge	.
all	of	you	here	are	tremendously	imbued	with	tremendous	amounts	of	knowledge	and	what	i	'd	like	to	do	is	invite	each	and	every	one	of	you	to	contribute	to	this	project	and	other	projects	of	its	type	,	because	i	think	together	we	can	truly	change	the	landscape	of	education	and	educational	publishing	.
so	,	thanks	very	much	.
