ok	.	we	've	heard	a	lot	of	people	speak	at	this	conference	about	the	power	of	the	human	mind	.
and	what	i	'd	like	to	do	today	is	give	you	a	vivid	example	of	how	that	power	can	be	unleashed	when	someone	is	in	a	survival	situation	,	how	the	will	to	survive	can	bring	that	out	in	people	.
this	is	an	incident	which	occurred	on	mount	everest	;
it	was	the	worst	disaster	in	the	history	of	everest	.
and	when	it	occurred	,	i	was	the	only	doctor	on	the	mountain	.
so	i	'll	take	you	through	that	and	we	'll	see	what	it	's	like	when	someone	really	summons	the	will	to	survive	.
ok	,	this	is	mount	everest	.
it	's	29,035	feet	high	.
i	've	been	there	six	times	:	four	times	i	did	work	with	national	geographic	,	making	tectonic	plate	measurements	;
twice	,	i	went	with	nasa	doing	remote	sensing	devices	.
it	was	on	my	fourth	trip	to	everest	that	a	comet	passed	over	the	mountain	.	hyakutake	.
and	the	sherpas	told	us	then	that	was	a	very	bad	omen	,	and	we	should	have	listened	to	them	.
everest	is	an	extreme	environment	.
there	's	only	one	-	third	as	much	oxygen	at	the	summit	as	there	is	at	sea	level	.
near	the	summit	,	temperatures	can	be	40	degrees	below	zero	.
you	can	have	winds	20	to	40	miles	an	hour	.
it	's	actually	a	wind	-	chill	factor	which	is	lower	than	a	summer	day	on	mars	.
i	remember	one	time	being	up	near	the	summit	,
i	reached	into	my	down	jacket	for	a	drink	from	my	water	bottle	,	inside	my	down	jacket	,	only	to	discover	that	the	water	was	already	frozen	solid	.
that	gives	you	an	idea	of	just	how	severe	things	are	near	the	summit	.
ok	,	this	is	the	route	up	everest	.
it	starts	at	base	camp	,	at	17,500	feet	.
camp	one	,	2,000	feet	higher	.
camp	two	,	another	2,000	feet	higher	up	,	what	's	called	the	western	cwm	.
campthree	is	at	the	base	of	lhotse	,	which	is	the	fourth	highest	mountain	in	the	world	,	but	it	's	dwarfed	by	everest	.
and	then	camp	four	is	the	highest	camp	;
that	's	3,000	feet	short	of	the	summit	.
this	is	a	view	of	base	camp	.
this	is	pitched	on	a	glacier	at	17,500	feet	.
it	's	the	highest	point	you	can	bring	your	yaks	before	you	have	to	unload	.
and	this	is	what	they	unloaded	for	me	:
i	had	four	yak	loads	of	medical	supplies	,	which	are	dumped	in	a	tent	,
and	here	i	am	trying	to	arrange	things	.
this	was	our	expedition	.
it	was	a	national	geographic	expedition	,	but	it	was	organized	by	the	explorers	club	.
there	were	three	other	expeditions	on	the	mountain	,	an	american	team	,	a	new	zealand	team	and	an	imax	team	.
and	,	after	actually	two	months	of	preparation	,	we	built	our	camps	all	the	way	up	the	mountain	.
this	is	a	view	looking	up	the	icefall	,
the	first	2,000	feet	of	the	climb	up	from	base	camp	.
and	here	's	a	picture	in	the	icefall	;
it	's	a	waterfall	,	but	it	's	frozen	,	but	it	moves	very	slowly	,	and	it	actually	changes	every	day	.
when	you	're	in	it	,	you	're	like	a	rat	in	a	maze	;	you	ca	n't	even	see	over	the	top	.
this	is	near	the	top	of	the	icefall	.
you	want	to	climb	through	at	night	when	the	ice	is	frozen	.
that	way	,	it	's	less	likely	to	tumble	down	on	you	.
these	are	some	climbers	reaching	the	top	of	the	icefall	just	at	sun	-	up	.	this	is	me	crossing	a	crevasse	.
we	cross	on	aluminum	ladders	with	safety	ropes	attached	.
that	's	another	crevasse	.
some	of	these	things	are	10	stories	deep	or	more	,	and	one	of	my	climbing	friends	says	that	the	reason	we	actually	climb	at	night	is	because	if	we	ever	saw	the	bottom	of	what	we	're	climbing	over	,	we	would	never	do	it	.
okay	.	this	is	camp	one	.
it	's	the	first	flat	spot	you	can	reach	after	you	get	up	to	the	top	of	the	icefall	.
and	from	there	we	climb	up	to	camp	two	,
which	is	sort	of	the	foreground	.
these	are	climbers	moving	up	the	lhotse	face	,	that	mountain	toward	camp	three	.
they	're	on	fixed	ropes	here	.
a	fall	here	,	if	you	were	n't	roped	in	,	would	be	5,000	feet	down	.
this	is	a	view	taken	from	camp	three	.
you	can	see	the	lhotse	face	is	in	profile	,
it	's	about	a	45	degree	angle	.	it	takes	two	days	to	climb	it	,
so	you	put	the	camp	halfway	through	.
if	you	notice	,	the	summit	of	everest	is	black	.
there	's	no	ice	over	it	.
and	that	's	because	everest	is	so	high	,	it	's	in	the	jet	stream	,	and	winds	are	constantly	scouring	the	face	,	so	no	snow	gets	to	accumulate	.
what	looks	like	a	cloud	behind	the	summit	ridge	is	actually	snow	being	blown	off	the	summit	.
this	is	on	the	way	up	from	camp	three	to	camp	four	,	moving	in	,	up	through	the	clouds	.
and	this	is	at	camp	four	.
once	you	get	to	camp	four	,	you	have	maybe	24	hours	to	decide	if	you	're	going	to	go	for	the	summit	or	not	.
everybody	's	on	oxygen	,	your	supplies	are	limited	,	and	you	either	have	to	go	up	or	go	down	,	make	that	decision	very	quickly	.
this	is	a	picture	of	rob	hall	.
he	was	the	leader	of	the	new	zealand	team	.
this	is	a	radio	he	used	later	to	call	his	wife	that	i	'll	tell	you	about	.
these	are	some	climbers	waiting	to	go	to	the	summit	.
they	're	up	at	camp	four	,	and	you	can	see	that	there	's	wind	blowing	off	the	summit	.
this	is	not	good	weather	to	climb	in	,	so	the	climbers	are	just	waiting	,	hoping	that	the	wind	's	going	to	die	down	.
and	,	in	fact	,	the	wind	does	die	down	at	night	.
it	becomes	very	calm	,	there	's	no	wind	at	all	.
this	looks	like	a	good	chance	to	go	for	the	summit	.
so	here	are	some	climbers	starting	out	for	the	summit	on	what	's	called	the	triangular	face	.
it	's	the	first	part	of	climb	.
it	's	done	in	the	dark	,	because	it	's	actually	less	steep	than	what	comes	next	,	and	you	can	gain	daylight	hours	if	you	do	this	in	the	dark	.
so	that	's	what	happened	.
the	climbers	got	on	the	southeast	ridge	.
this	is	the	view	looking	at	the	southeast	ridge	.
the	summit	would	be	in	the	foreground	.
from	here	,	it	's	about	1,500	feet	up	at	a	30	-	degree	angle	to	the	summit	.
but	what	happened	that	year	was	the	wind	suddenly	and	unexpectedly	picked	up	.
a	storm	blew	in	that	no	one	was	anticipating	.
you	can	see	here	some	ferocious	winds	blowing	snow	way	high	off	the	summit	.
and	there	were	climbers	on	that	summit	ridge	.
this	is	a	picture	of	me	in	that	area	taken	a	year	before	,	and	you	can	see	i	've	got	an	oxygen	mask	on	with	a	rebreather	.
i	have	an	oxygen	hose	connected	here	.
you	can	see	on	this	climber	,	we	have	two	oxygen	tanks	in	the	backpack	--	little	titanium	tanks	,	very	lightweight	--
and	we	're	not	carrying	much	else	.
this	is	all	you	've	got	.	you	're	very	exposed	on	the	summit	ridge	.
ok	,	this	is	a	view	taken	on	the	summit	ridge	itself	.
this	is	on	the	way	toward	the	summit	,	on	that	1,500	-	foot	bridge	.
all	the	climbers	here	are	climbing	unroped	,	and	the	reason	is	because	the	drop	off	is	so	sheer	on	either	side	that	if	you	were	roped	to	somebody	,	you	'd	wind	up	just	pulling	them	off	with	you	.
so	each	person	climbs	individually	.
and	it	's	not	a	straight	path	at	all	,
it	's	very	difficult	climbing	,	and	there	's	always	the	risk	of	falling	on	either	side	.
if	you	fall	to	your	left	,	you	're	going	to	fall	8,000	feet	into	nepal	;
if	you	fall	to	your	right	,	you	're	going	to	fall	12,000	feet	into	tibet	.
so	it	's	probably	better	to	fall	into	tibet
because	you	'll	live	longer	.
but	,	either	way	,	you	fall	for	the	rest	of	your	life	.
ok	.	those	climbers	were	up	near	the	summit	,	along	that	summit	ridge	that	you	see	up	there	,	and	i	was	down	here	in	camp	three	.
my	expedition	was	down	in	camp	three	,	while	these	guys	were	up	there	in	the	storm	.
the	storm	was	so	fierce	that	we	had	to	lay	,
fully	dressed	,	fully	equipped	,	laid	out	on	the	tent	floor	to	stop	the	tent	from	blowing	off	the	mountain	.
it	was	the	worst	winds	i	've	ever	seen	.
and	the	climbers	up	on	the	ridge	were	that	much	higher	,	2,000	feet	higher	,	and	completely	exposed	to	the	elements	.
we	were	in	radio	contact	with	some	of	them	.
this	is	a	view	taken	along	the	summit	ridge	.
rob	hall	,	we	heard	by	radio	,	was	up	here	,	at	this	point	in	the	storm	with	doug	hansen	.
and	we	heard	that	rob	was	ok	,	but	doug	was	too	weak	to	come	down	.
he	was	exhausted	,	and	rob	was	staying	with	him	.
we	also	got	some	bad	news	in	the	storm	that	beck	weathers	,	another	climber	,	had	collapsed	in	the	snow	and	was	dead	.
there	were	still	18	other	climbers	that	we	were	n't	aware	of	their	condition	.
they	were	lost	.	there	was	total	confusion	on	the	mountain	;
all	the	stories	were	confusing	,	most	of	them	were	conflicting	.
we	really	had	no	idea	what	was	going	on	during	that	storm	.
we	were	just	hunkered	down	in	our	tents	at	camp	three	.
our	two	strongest	climbers	,	todd	burleson	and	pete	athans	,	decided	to	go	up	to	try	to	rescue	who	they	could	even	though	there	was	a	ferocious	storm	going	.
they	tried	to	radio	a	message	to	rob	hall	,	who	was	a	superb	climber	stuck	,	sort	of	,	with	a	weak	climber	up	near	the	summit	.
i	expected	them	to	say	to	rob	,	``	hold	on	.	we	're	coming	.	``
but	in	fact	,	what	they	said	was	,	``	leave	doug	and	come	down	yourself	.
there	's	no	chance	of	saving	him	,	and	just	try	to	save	yourself	at	this	point	.	``
and	rob	got	that	message	,	but	his	answer	was	,	``	we	're	both	listening	.	``
todd	and	pete	got	up	to	the	summit	ridge	,	up	in	here	,	and	it	was	a	scene	of	complete	chaos	up	there	.
but	they	did	what	they	could	to	stabilize	the	people	.
i	gave	them	radio	advice	from	camp	three	,	and	we	sent	down	the	climbers	that	could	make	it	down	under	their	own	power	.
the	ones	that	could	n't	we	just	sort	of	decided	to	leave	up	at	camp	four	.
so	the	climbers	were	coming	down	along	this	route	.
this	is	taken	from	camp	three	,	where	i	was	.
and	they	all	came	by	me	so	i	could	take	a	look	at	them	and	see	what	i	could	do	for	them	,	which	is	really	not	much	,	because	camp	three	is	a	little	notch	cut	in	the	ice	in	the	middle	of	a	45	-	degree	angle	.
you	can	barely	stand	outside	the	tent	.
it	's	really	cold	;	it	's	24,000	feet	.
the	only	supplies	i	had	at	that	altitude	were	two	plastic	bags	with	preloaded	syringes	of	painkiller	and	steroids	.
so	,	as	the	climbers	came	by	me	,	i	sort	of	assessed	whether	or	not	they	were	in	condition	to	continue	on	further	down	.
the	ones	that	were	n't	that	lucid	or	were	not	that	well	coordinated	,	i	would	give	an	injection	of	steroids	to	try	to	give	them	some	period	of	lucidity	and	coordination	where	they	could	then	work	their	way	further	down	the	mountain	.
it	's	so	awkward	to	work	up	there	that	sometimes	i	even	gave	the	injections	right	through	their	clothes	.
it	was	just	too	hard	to	maneuver	any	other	way	up	there	.
while	i	was	taking	care	of	them	,	we	got	more	news	about	rob	hall	.
there	was	no	way	we	could	get	up	high	enough	to	rescue	him	.
he	called	in	to	say	that	he	was	alone	now	.
apparently	,	doug	had	died	higher	up	on	the	mountain	.
but	rob	was	now	too	weak	to	come	down	himself	,	and	with	the	fierce	winds	and	up	at	that	altitude	,	he	was	just	beyond	rescue	and	he	knew	it	.
at	that	point	,	he	asked	to	be	paged	into	his	wife	.
he	was	carrying	a	radio	.
his	wife	was	home	in	new	zealand	,	seven	months	pregnant	with	their	first	child	,
and	rob	asked	to	be	patched	into	her	.	that	was	done	,
and	rob	and	his	wife	had	their	last	conversation	.
they	picked	the	name	for	their	baby	.
rob	then	signed	off	,	and	that	was	the	last	we	ever	heard	of	him	.
i	was	faced	with	treating	a	lot	of	critically	ill	patients	at	24,000	feet	,	which	was	an	impossibility	.
so	what	we	did	was	,	we	got	the	victims	down	to	21,000	feet	,	where	it	was	easier	for	me	to	treat	them	.
this	was	my	medical	kit	.
it	's	a	tackle	box	filled	with	medical	supplies	.
this	is	what	i	carried	up	the	mountain	.
i	had	more	supplies	lower	down	,	which	i	asked	to	be	brought	up	to	meet	me	at	the	lower	camp	.
and	this	was	scene	at	the	lower	camp	.
the	survivors	came	in	one	by	one	.
some	of	them	were	hypothermic	,	some	of	them	were	frostbitten	,	some	were	both	.
what	we	did	was	try	to	warm	them	up	as	best	we	could	,	put	oxygen	on	them	and	try	to	revive	them	,	which	is	difficult	to	do	at	21,000	feet	,	when	the	tent	is	freezing	.
this	is	some	severe	frostbite	on	the	feet	,	severe	frostbite	on	the	nose	.
this	climber	was	snow	blind	.
as	i	was	taking	care	of	these	climbers	,	we	got	a	startling	experience	.
out	of	nowhere	,	beck	weathers	,	who	we	had	already	been	told	was	dead	,	stumbled	into	the	tent	,	just	like	a	mummy	,	he	walked	into	the	tent	.
i	expected	him	to	be	incoherent	,	but	,	in	fact	,	he	walked	into	the	tent	and	said	to	me	,	``	hi	,	ken	.	where	should	i	sit	?	``
and	then	he	said	,	``	do	you	accept	my	health	insurance	?	``
he	really	said	that	.
so	he	was	completely	lucid	,	but	he	was	very	severely	frostbitten	.
you	can	see	his	hand	is	completely	white	;	his	face	,	his	nose	,	is	burned	.
first	,	it	turns	white	,	and	then	when	it	's	completed	necrosis	,	it	turns	black	,	and	then	it	falls	off	.
it	's	the	last	stage	,	just	like	a	scar	.
so	,	as	i	was	taking	care	of	beck	,	he	related	what	had	been	going	on	up	there	.
he	said	he	had	gotten	lost	in	the	storm	,	collapsed	in	the	snow	,	and	just	laid	there	,	unable	to	move	.
some	climbers	had	come	by	and	looked	at	him	,	and	he	heard	them	say	,	``	he	's	dead	.	``
but	beck	was	n't	dead	;	he	heard	that	,	but	he	was	completely	unable	to	move	.
he	was	in	some	sort	of	catatonic	state	where	he	could	be	aware	of	his	surroundings	,	but	could	n't	even	blink	to	indicate	that	he	was	alive	.
so	the	climbers	passed	him	by	,	and	beck	lay	there	for	a	day	,	a	night	and	another	day	,	in	the	snow	.
and	then	he	said	to	himself	,	``	i	do	n't	want	to	die	.
i	have	a	family	to	come	back	to	.	``
and	the	thoughts	of	his	family	,	his	kids	and	his	wife	,	generated	enough	energy	,	enough	motivation	in	him	,	so	that	he	actually	got	up	.
after	laying	in	the	snow	that	long	a	time	,	he	got	up	and	found	his	way	back	to	the	camp	.
and	beck	told	me	that	story	very	quietly	,	but	i	was	absolutely	stunned	by	it	.
i	could	n't	imagine	anybody	laying	in	the	snow	that	long	a	time	and	then	getting	up	.
he	apparently	reversed	an	irreversible	hypothermia	.
and	i	can	only	try	to	speculate	on	how	he	did	it	.
so	,	what	if	we	had	beck	hooked	up	to	a	spect	scan	,	something	that	could	actually	measure	brain	function	?
just	very	simply	,	the	three	parts	of	the	brain	:	the	frontal	lobe	,	where	you	focus	your	attention	and	concentration	;	you	have	the	temporal	lobe	,	where	you	form	images	and	keep	memories	;	and	the	posterior	part	of	your	brain	,	which	contains	the	cerebellum	,	which	controls	motion	;	and	the	brain	stem	,	where	you	have	your	basic	maintenance	functions	,	like	heartbeat	and	respiration	.
so	let	's	take	a	cut	through	the	brain	here	,	and	imagine	that	beck	was	hooked	up	to	a	spect	scan	.	this	measures	dynamic	blood	flow	and	therefore	energy	flow	within	the	brain	.
so	you	have	the	prefrontal	cortex	here	,	lighting	up	in	red	.
this	is	a	pretty	evenly	distributed	scan	.
you	have	the	middle	area	,	where	the	temporal	lobe	might	be	,	in	here	,	and	the	posterior	portion	,	where	the	maintenance	functions	are	in	the	back	.
this	is	a	roughly	normal	scan	,	showing	equal	distribution	of	energy	.
now	,	you	go	to	this	one	and	you	see	how	much	more	the	frontal	lobes	are	lighting	up	.
this	might	be	what	beck	would	be	experiencing	when	he	realizes	he	's	in	danger	.
he	's	focusing	all	his	attention	on	getting	himself	out	of	trouble	.
these	parts	of	the	brain	are	quieting	down	.	he	's	not	thinking	about	his	family	or	anybody	else	at	this	point	,	and	he	's	working	pretty	hard	.
he	's	trying	to	get	his	muscles	going	and	get	out	of	this	.
ok	,	but	he	's	losing	ground	here	.
he	's	running	out	of	energy	.
it	's	too	cold	;	he	ca	n't	keep	his	metabolic	fires	going	,
and	,	you	see	,	there	's	no	more	red	here	;
his	brain	is	quieting	down	.
he	's	collapsed	in	the	snow	here	.	everything	is	quiet	,
there	's	very	little	red	anywhere	.
beck	is	powering	down	.
he	's	dying	.
you	go	on	to	the	next	scan	,	but	,	in	beck	's	case	,	you	can	see	that	the	middle	part	of	his	brain	is	beginning	to	light	up	again	.
he	's	beginning	to	think	about	his	family	.
he	's	beginning	to	have	images	that	are	motivating	him	to	get	up	.
he	's	developing	energy	in	this	area	through	thought	.
and	this	is	how	he	's	going	to	turn	thought	back	into	action	.
this	part	of	the	brain	is	called	the	anterior	cingulate	gyrus	.
it	's	an	area	in	which	a	lot	of	neuroscientists	believe	the	seat	of	will	exists	.
this	is	where	people	make	decisions	,	where	they	develop	willpower	.
and	,	you	can	see	,	there	's	an	energy	flow	going	from	the	mid	portion	of	his	brain	,	where	he	's	got	images	of	his	family	,	into	this	area	,	which	is	powering	his	will	.
okay	.	this	is	getting	stronger	and	stronger	to	the	point	where	it	's	actually	going	to	be	a	motivating	factor	.
he	's	going	to	develop	enough	energy	in	that	area	--	after	a	day	,	a	night	and	a	day	--	to	actually	motivate	himself	to	get	up	.
and	you	can	see	here	,	he	's	starting	to	get	more	energy	into	the	frontal	lobe	.
he	's	beginning	to	focus	,	he	can	concentrate	now	.
he	's	thinking	about	what	he	's	got	to	do	to	save	himself	.
so	this	energy	has	been	transmitted	up	toward	the	front	of	his	brain	,	and	it	's	getting	quieter	down	here	,	but	he	's	using	this	energy	to	think	about	what	he	has	to	do	to	get	himself	going	.
and	then	,	that	energy	is	sort	of	spreading	throughout	his	thought	areas	.
he	's	not	thinking	about	his	family	now	,	and	he	's	getting	himself	motivated	.
this	is	the	posterior	part	,	where	his	muscles	are	going	to	be	moving	,	and	he	's	going	to	be	pacing	himself	.
his	heart	and	lungs	are	going	to	pick	up	speed	.
so	this	is	what	i	can	speculate	might	have	been	going	on	had	we	been	able	to	do	a	spect	scan	on	beck	during	this	survival	epic	.
so	here	i	am	taking	care	of	beck	at	21,000	feet	,	and	i	felt	what	i	was	doing	was	completely	trivial	compared	to	what	he	had	done	for	himself	.
it	just	shows	you	what	the	power	of	the	mind	can	do	.
he	was	critically	ill	,	there	were	other	critically	ill	patients	;
luckily	,	we	were	able	to	get	a	helicopter	in	to	rescue	these	guys	.
a	helicopter	came	in	at	21,000	feet	and	carried	out	the	highest	helicopter	rescue	in	history	.
it	was	able	to	land	on	the	ice	,	take	away	beck	and	the	other	survivors	,	one	by	one	,	and	get	them	off	to	kathmandu	in	a	clinic	before	we	even	got	back	to	base	camp	.
this	is	a	scene	at	base	camp	,	at	one	of	the	camps	where	some	of	the	climbers	were	lost	.
and	we	had	a	memorial	service	there	a	few	days	later	.
these	are	serphas	lighting	juniper	branches	.
they	believe	juniper	smoke	is	holy	.
and	the	climbers	stood	around	on	the	high	rocks	and	spoke	of	the	climbers	who	were	lost	up	near	the	summit	,	turning	to	the	mountain	,	actually	,	to	talk	to	them	directly	.
there	were	five	climbers	lost	here	.
this	was	scott	fischer	,	rob	hall	,	andy	harris	,	doug	hansen	and	yasuko	namba	.
and	one	more	climber	should	have	died	that	day	,	but	did	n't	,	and	that	's	beck	weathers	.
he	was	able	to	survive	because	he	was	able	to	generate	that	incredible	willpower	,	he	was	able	to	use	all	the	power	of	his	mind	to	save	himself	.
these	are	tibetan	prayer	flags	.
these	sherpas	believe	that	if	you	write	prayers	on	these	flags	,
the	message	will	be	carried	up	to	the	gods	,	and	that	year	,	beck	's	message	was	answered	.
thank	you	.
