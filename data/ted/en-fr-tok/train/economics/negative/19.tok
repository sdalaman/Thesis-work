i	do	n't	know	about	you	,	but	i	have	n't	quite	figured	out	exactly	what	technology	means	in	my	life	.
i	've	spent	the	past	year	thinking	about	what	it	really	should	be	about	.
should	i	be	pro	-	technology	?	should	i	embrace	it	full	arms	?
should	i	be	wary	?	like	you	,	i	'm	very	tempted	by	the	latest	thing	.
but	at	the	other	hand	,	a	couple	of	years	ago	i	gave	up	all	of	my	possessions	,	sold	all	my	technology	--	except	for	a	bicycle	--	and	rode	across	3,000	miles	on	the	u.s.	back	roads	under	the	power	of	my	one	body	,	fuelled	mostly	by	twinkies	and	junk	food	.
and	i	've	since	then	tried	to	keep	technology	at	arm	's	length	in	many	ways	,	so	it	does	n't	master	my	life	.
at	the	same	time	,	i	run	a	website	on	cool	tools	,	where	i	issue	a	daily	obsession	of	the	latest	things	in	technology	.	so	i	'm	still	perplexed	about	what	the	true	meaning	of	technology	is	as	it	relates	to	humanity	,	as	it	relates	to	nature	,	as	it	relates	to	the	spiritual	.
and	i	'm	not	even	sure	we	know	what	technology	is	.
and	one	definition	of	technology	is	that	which	is	first	recorded	.
this	is	the	first	example	of	the	modern	use	of	technology	that	i	can	find	.
it	was	the	suggested	syllabus	for	dealing	with	the	applied	arts	and	science	at	cambridge	university	in	1829	.
before	that	,	obviously	,	technology	did	n't	exist	.	but	obviously	it	did	.
i	like	one	of	the	definitions	that	alan	kay	has	for	technology	.
he	says	technology	is	anything	that	was	invented	after	you	were	born	.
so	it	sums	up	a	lot	of	what	we	're	talking	about	.
danny	hillis	actually	has	an	update	on	that	--
he	says	technology	is	anything	that	does	n't	quite	work	yet	.
which	also	,	i	think	,	gets	into	a	little	bit	of	our	current	idea	.
but	i	was	interested	in	another	definition	of	technology	.
something	,	again	,	that	went	back	to	something	more	fundamental	.
something	that	was	deeper	.	and	as	i	struggled	to	understand	that	,	i	came	up	with	a	way	of	framing	the	question	that	seemed	to	work	for	me	in	my	investigations	.
and	i	'm	,	this	morning	,	going	to	talk	about	this	for	the	first	time	.
so	this	is	a	very	rough	attempt	to	think	out	loud	.
the	question	that	i	came	up	with	was	this	question	:	what	does	technology	want	?	and	by	that	,	i	do	n't	mean	,	does	it	want	chocolate	or	vanilla	?	by	what	it	wants	,	i	mean	,	what	are	its	inherent	trends	and	biases	?
what	are	its	tendencies	over	time	?	one	way	to	think	about	this	is	thinking	about	biological	organisms	,	which	we	've	heard	a	lot	about	.
and	the	trick	that	richard	dawkins	does	,	which	is	to	say	,	to	look	at	them	as	simply	as	genes	,	as	vehicles	for	genes	.
so	he	's	saying	,	what	do	genes	want	?	the	selfish	gene	.
and	i	'm	applying	a	similar	trick	to	say	,	what	if	we	looked	at	the	universe	in	our	culture	through	the	eyes	of	technology	?	what	does	technology	want	?
obviously	,	this	in	an	incomplete	question	,	just	as	looking	at	an	organism	as	only	a	gene	is	an	incomplete	way	of	looking	at	it	.
but	it	's	still	very	,	very	productive	.	so	i	'm	attempting	to	say	,	if	we	take	technology	's	view	of	the	world	,	what	does	it	want	?
and	i	think	once	we	ask	that	question	we	have	to	go	back	,	actually	,	to	life	.	because	obviously	,	if	we	keep	extending	the	origins	of	technology	far	back	,	i	think	we	come	back	to	life	at	some	point	.
so	that	's	where	i	want	to	begin	my	little	exploration	,	is	in	life	.
and	like	you	heard	from	the	previous	speakers	,	we	do	n't	really	know	what	life	there	is	on	earth	right	now	.
we	have	really	no	idea	.
craig	venter	's	tremendous	and	brilliant	attempt	to	dna	sequence	things	in	the	ocean	is	great	.
brian	farrell	's	work	is	all	part	of	this	agenda	to	try	and	actually	discover	all	the	species	on	earth	.
and	one	of	the	things	that	we	should	do	is	just	make	a	grid	of	the	globe	and	randomly	go	and	inspect	all	the	places	that	the	grid	intersects	,	just	to	see	what	's	on	life	.	and	if	we	did	that	with	our	little	martian	probe	,	which	we	have	not	done	on	earth	,	we	would	begin	to	see	some	incredible	species	.
this	is	not	on	another	planet	.	these	are	things	that	are	hidden	away	on	our	planet	.
this	is	an	ant	that	stores	its	colleagues	'	honey	in	its	abdomen	.
each	one	of	these	organisms	that	we	've	described	--	that	you	've	seen	from	jamie	and	others	,	these	magnificent	things	--	what	they	're	doing	,	each	one	of	them	,	is	they	're	hacking	the	rules	of	life	.
i	ca	n't	think	of	a	single	general	principle	of	biology	that	does	not	have	an	exception	somewhere	by	some	organism	.
every	single	thing	that	we	can	think	of	--	and	if	you	heard	olivia	's	talk	about	the	sexual	habits	,	you	'll	realize	that	there	is	n't	anything	we	can	say	that	's	true	for	all	life	,
because	every	single	one	of	them	is	hacking	something	about	it	.
this	is	a	solar	-	powered	sea	slug	.	it	's	a	nudibranch	that	has	incorporated	chloroplast	inside	it	to	drive	its	energy	.
this	is	another	version	of	that	.	this	is	a	sea	dragon	,	and	the	one	on	the	bottom	,	the	blue	one	,	is	a	juvenile	that	has	not	yet	swallowed	the	acid	,	has	not	yet	taken	in	the	brown	-	green	algae	pond	scum	into	its	body	to	give	it	energy	.
these	are	hacks	,	and	if	we	looked	at	the	general	shape	of	the	approaches	to	hacking	life	there	are	,	current	consensus	,	six	kingdoms	.	six	different	broad	approaches	:	the	plants	,	the	animals	,	the	fungi	,	the	protests	--	the	little	things	--	the	bacteria	and	the	archaea	bacteria	.	the	archaeas	.
those	are	the	general	approaches	to	life	.	that	's	one	way	to	look	at	life	on	earth	today	.
but	a	more	interesting	way	,	the	current	way	to	take	the	long	view	,	is	to	look	at	it	in	an	evolutionary	perspective	.
and	here	we	have	a	view	of	evolution	where	rather	than	having	evolution	go	over	the	linear	time	,	we	have	it	coming	out	from	the	center	.
so	in	the	center	is	the	most	primitive	,	and	this	is	a	genealogical	chart	of	all	life	on	earth	.	this	is	all	the	same	six	kingdoms	.
you	see	4,000	representative	species	,	and	you	can	see	where	we	are	.
but	what	i	like	about	this	is	it	shows	that	every	living	organism	on	earth	today	is	equally	evolved	.
those	fungi	and	bacteria	are	as	highly	evolved	as	humans	.
they	've	been	around	just	as	long	and	gone	through	just	the	same	kind	of	trial	and	error	to	get	here	.
but	we	see	that	each	one	of	these	is	actually	hacking	,	and	has	a	different	way	of	finding	out	how	to	do	life	.
and	if	we	take	the	long	-	term	trends	of	life	,	if	we	begin	to	say	,	what	does	evolution	want	?	there	's	several	things	that	we	see	.
one	of	the	things	about	evolution	is	that	nowhere	on	earth	have	we	ever	been	where	we	do	n't	find	life	.
we	find	life	at	the	bottom	of	every	long	-	term	,	long	-	distance	drilling	core	into	the	center	of	rock	that	we	bring	up	--	and	there	's	bacteria	in	the	pores	of	that	rock	.
and	wherever	life	is	,	it	never	retreats	.	it	's	ubiquitous	and	it	wants	to	be	more	.
more	and	more	of	the	inert	matter	of	the	globe	is	being	touched	and	animated	by	life	.
the	second	thing	is	is	we	see	diversity	.	we	also	see	specialization	.
we	see	the	movement	from	a	general	-	purpose	cell	to	the	more	specific	and	specialized	.
and	we	see	a	drift	towards	complexity	that	's	very	intuitive	.
and	actually	,	we	have	current	data	that	does	show	that	there	is	an	actual	drift	towards	complexity	over	time	.
and	the	last	thing	,	i	bring	back	this	nudibranch	.
one	of	the	things	we	see	about	life	is	that	it	moves	from	the	inner	to	increasing	sociability	.	and	by	that	it	means	that	there	is	more	and	more	of	life	whose	entire	environment	is	other	life	.
like	those	chloroplast	cells	--	they	're	completely	surrounded	by	other	life	.
they	never	touch	the	inner	matter	.	there	is	more	and	more	co	-	evolution	.
and	so	the	general	,	long	-	term	trends	of	evolution	are	roughly	these	five	:	ubiquity	,	diversity	,	specialization	,	complexity	and	socialization	.	now	,	i	took	that	and	said	,	ok	,	what	are	the	long	-	term	trends	in	technology	?	and	again	,	my	question	is	,	what	does	technology	want	?	and	so	,	remarkably	,	i	discovered	that	there	's	also	a	drift	toward	specialization	.
that	we	see	there	's	a	general	hammer	,	and	hammers	become	more	and	more	specific	over	time	.
there	's	obviously	diversity	.	huge	numbers	of	things	.
this	is	all	the	contents	of	a	japanese	home	.
i	actually	had	my	daughter	--	gave	her	a	tally	counter	,	and	i	gave	her	an	assignment	last	summer	to	go	around	and	count	the	number	of	species	of	technology	in	our	household	.
and	it	came	up	with	6,000	different	species	of	products	.
i	did	some	research	and	found	out	that	the	king	of	england	,	henry	viii	,	had	only	about	7,000	items	in	his	household	.
and	he	was	the	king	of	england	,	and	that	was	the	entire	wealth	of	england	at	the	time	.
so	we	're	seeing	huge	numbers	of	diversity	in	the	kinds	of	things	.
this	is	a	scene	from	star	wars	where	the	3po	comes	out	and	he	sees	machines	making	machines	.	how	depraved	!
well	,	this	is	actually	what	we	're	headed	towards	:	world	machines	.
and	the	technology	is	only	being	thrown	out	by	other	technologies	.
most	machines	will	only	ever	be	in	contact	with	other	technology	and	not	non	-	technology	,	or	even	life	.
and	thirdly	,	the	idea	that	machines	are	becoming	biological	and	complex	is	at	this	point	a	cliche	.	and	i	'm	happy	to	say	,	i	was	partly	responsible	for	that	cliche	that	machines	are	becoming	biological	,	but	that	's	pretty	evident	.
so	the	major	trends	in	technology	evolution	actually	are	the	same	as	in	biological	evolution	.	the	same	drives	that	we	see	towards	ubiquity	,	towards	diversity	,	towards	socialization	,	towards	complexity	.	that	is	maybe	not	a	big	surprise	because	if	we	map	out	,	say	,	the	evolution	of	armor	,	you	can	actually	follow	a	sort	of	an	evolutionary	-	type	cladistic	tree	.
i	suggest	that	,	in	fact	,	technology	is	the	seventh	kingdom	of	life	.
that	its	operations	and	how	it	works	is	so	similar	that	we	can	think	of	it	as	the	seventh	kingdom	.
and	so	it	would	be	sort	of	approximately	up	there	,	coming	out	of	the	animal	kingdom	.	and	if	we	were	to	do	that	,	we	would	find	out	--	we	could	actually	approach	technology	in	this	way	.
this	is	niles	eldredge	.	he	was	the	co	-	developer	with	stephen	jay	gould	of	the	theory	of	punctuated	equilibrium	.
but	as	a	sideline	,	he	happens	to	collect	cornets	.
he	has	one	of	the	world	's	largest	collections	--	about	500	of	them	.
and	he	has	decided	to	treat	them	as	if	they	were	trilobites	,	or	snails	,	and	to	do	a	morphological	analysis	,	and	try	to	derive	their	genealogical	history	over	time	.
this	is	his	chart	,	which	is	not	quite	published	yet	.
but	the	most	interesting	aspect	about	this	is	that	if	you	look	at	those	red	lines	at	the	bottom	,	those	indicate	basically	a	parentage	of	a	type	of	cornet	that	was	no	longer	made	.	that	does	not	happen	in	biology	.
when	something	is	extinct	,	you	ca	n't	have	it	as	your	parent	.
but	that	does	happen	in	technology	.	and	it	turns	out	that	that	's	so	distinctive	that	you	can	actually	look	at	this	tree	,	and	you	can	actually	use	it	to	determine	that	this	is	a	technological	system	versus	a	biological	system	.
in	fact	,	this	idea	of	resurrecting	the	whole	idea	is	so	important	that	i	began	to	think	about	what	happens	with	old	technology	.
and	it	turns	out	that	,	in	fact	,	technologies	do	n't	die	.
so	i	suggested	this	to	an	historian	of	science	,	and	he	said	,	``	well	,	what	about	,	you	know	,	come	on	,	what	about	steam	cars	?
they	're	not	around	anymore	.	``	well	actually	,	they	are	.
in	fact	,	they	're	so	around	that	you	can	buy	new	parts	for	a	stanley	steam	automobile	.
and	this	is	a	website	of	a	guy	who	's	selling	brand	new	parts	for	the	stanley	automobile	.	and	the	thing	that	i	liked	is	sort	of	this	one	-	click	,	add	-	to	-	your	-	cart	button	--	--	for	buying	steam	valves	.	i	mean	,	it	was	just	--	it	was	really	there	.
and	so	,	i	began	to	think	about	,	well	,	maybe	that	's	just	a	random	sample	.
maybe	i	should	do	this	sort	of	in	a	more	conservative	way	.
so	i	took	the	great	big	1895	montgomery	ward	's	catalog	and	i	randomly	went	through	it	.	and	i	took	a	page	--	not	quite	a	random	page	--	i	took	a	page	that	was	actually	more	difficult	than	others	because	lots	of	the	pages	are	filled	with	things	that	are	still	being	made	.	but	i	took	this	page	and	i	said	,	how	many	of	these	things	are	still	being	made	?	and	not	antiques	.	i	want	to	know	how	many	of	these	things	are	still	in	production	.
and	the	answer	is	:	all	of	them	.
all	of	them	are	still	being	produced	.	so	you	've	got	corn	shellers	.
i	do	n't	know	who	needs	a	corn	sheller	.
be	it	corn	shellers	--	you	've	got	ploughs	;	you	've	got	fan	mills	;	all	these	things	--	and	these	are	not	,	again	,	antiques	.	these	are	--	you	can	order	these	.	you	can	go	to	the	web	and	you	can	buy	them	now	,	brand	-	new	made	.	so	in	a	certain	sense	,	technologies	do	n't	die	.
in	fact	,	you	can	buy	,	for	50	bucks	,	a	stone	-	age	knife	made	exactly	the	same	way	that	they	were	made	10,000	years	ago	.
it	's	short	,	bone	handle	,	50	bucks	.	and	in	fact	,	what	's	important	is	that	this	information	actually	never	died	out	.
it	's	not	just	that	it	was	resurrected	.	it	's	continued	all	along	.
and	in	papua	new	guinea	,	they	were	making	stone	axes	until	two	decades	ago	,	just	as	a	course	of	practical	matters	.
even	when	we	try	to	get	rid	of	a	technology	,	it	's	actually	very	hard	.
so	we	've	all	heard	about	the	amish	giving	up	cars	.
we	've	heard	about	the	japanese	giving	up	guns	.
we	've	heard	about	this	and	that	.	but	i	actually	went	back	and	took	what	i	could	find	,	the	examples	in	history	where	there	have	been	prohibitions	against	technology	,	and	then	i	tried	to	find	out	when	they	came	back	in	,	because	they	always	came	back	in	.	and	it	turns	out	that	the	time	,	the	duration	of	when	they	were	outlawed	and	prohibited	,	is	decreasing	over	time	.	and	that	basically	,	you	can	delay	technology	,	but	you	ca	n't	kill	it	.	so	this	makes	sense	,	because	in	a	certain	sense	what	culture	is	,	is	the	accumulation	of	ideas	.
that	's	what	it	's	for	.	it	's	so	that	ideas	do	n't	die	out	.
and	when	we	take	that	,	we	take	this	idea	of	what	culture	is	doing	and	add	it	to	what	the	long	-	term	trajectory	--	again	,	in	life	's	evolution	--	we	find	that	each	case	--	each	of	the	major	transitions	in	life	--	what	they	're	really	about	is	accelerating	and	changing	the	way	in	which	evolution	happens	.
they	're	actually	changing	the	way	in	which	ideas	are	generated	.
so	all	these	steps	in	evolution	are	increasing	,	basically	,	the	evolution	of	evolvability	.
so	what	's	happening	over	time	in	life	is	that	the	ways	in	which	you	generate	these	new	ideas	,	these	new	hacks	,	are	increasing	.	and	the	real	tricks	are	ways	in	which	you	kind	of	explore	the	way	of	exploring	.
and	then	what	we	see	in	the	singularity	,	that	prophesized	by	kurzweil	and	others	--	his	idea	that	technology	is	accelerating	evolution	.
it	's	accelerating	the	way	in	which	we	search	for	ideas	.
so	if	you	have	life	hacking	--	life	means	hacking	,	the	game	of	survival	--	then	evolution	is	a	way	to	extend	the	game	by	changing	the	rules	of	the	game	.
and	what	technology	is	really	about	is	better	ways	to	evolve	.
that	is	what	we	call	an	``	infinite	game	.	``
that	's	the	definition	of	``	infinite	game	.	``	a	finite	game	is	play	to	win	,	and	an	infinite	game	is	played	to	keep	playing	.
and	i	believe	that	technology	is	actually	a	cosmic	force	.
the	origins	of	technology	was	not	in	1829	,	but	was	actually	at	the	beginning	of	the	big	bang	,	and	at	that	moment	the	entire	huge	billions	of	stars	in	the	universe	were	compressed	.	the	entire	universe	was	compressed	into	a	little	quantum	dot	,	and	it	was	so	tight	in	there	,	there	was	no	room	for	any	difference	at	all	.
that	's	the	definition	.	there	was	no	temperature	.
there	was	no	difference	whatsoever	.	and	at	the	big	bang	,	what	it	expanded	was	the	potential	for	difference	.
so	as	it	expands	and	as	things	expand	what	we	have	is	the	potential	for	differences	,	diversity	,	options	,	choices	,	opportunities	,	possibilities	and	freedoms	.
those	are	all	basically	the	same	thing	.
and	those	are	the	things	that	technology	brings	us	.
that	's	what	technology	is	bringing	us	:	choices	,	possibilities	,	freedoms	.
that	's	what	it	's	about	.	it	's	this	expansion	of	room	to	make	differences	.
and	so	a	hammer	,	when	we	grab	a	hammer	,	that	's	what	we	're	grabbing	.
and	that	's	why	we	continue	to	grab	technology	--	because	we	want	those	things	.	those	things	are	good	.
differences	,	freedom	,	choices	,	possibilities	.
and	each	time	we	make	a	new	opportunity	place	,	we	're	allowing	a	platform	to	make	new	ones	.
and	i	think	it	's	really	important	.	because	if	you	can	imagine	mozart	before	the	technology	of	the	piano	was	invented	--	what	a	loss	to	society	there	would	be	.
imagine	van	gogh	being	born	before	the	technologies	of	cheap	oil	paints	.
imagine	hitchcock	before	the	technologies	of	film	.
somewhere	,	today	,	there	are	millions	of	young	children	being	born	whose	technology	of	self	-	expression	has	not	yet	been	invented	.
we	have	a	moral	obligation	to	invent	technology	so	that	every	person	on	the	globe	has	the	potential	to	realize	their	true	difference	.
we	want	a	trillion	zillion	species	of	one	individuals	.
that	's	what	technology	really	wants	.
i	'm	going	to	skip	through	some	of	the	objections	because	i	do	n't	have	answers	to	why	there	's	deforestation	.	i	do	n't	have	an	answer	to	the	fact	that	there	seem	to	be	bad	technologies	.	i	do	n't	have	an	answer	to	how	this	impacts	on	our	dignity	,	other	than	to	suggest	that	maybe	the	seventh	kingdom	,	because	it	's	so	close	to	what	life	is	about	,	maybe	we	can	bring	it	back	and	have	it	help	us	monitor	life	.
maybe	in	some	ways	the	fact	that	what	we	're	trying	to	do	with	technology	is	find	a	good	home	for	it	.
it	's	a	terrible	thing	to	spray	ddt	on	cotton	fields	,	but	it	's	a	really	good	thing	to	use	to	eliminate	millions	of	cases	of	death	due	to	malaria	in	a	small	village	.
our	humanity	is	actually	defined	by	technology	.
all	the	things	that	we	think	that	we	really	like	about	humanity	is	being	driven	by	technology	.	this	is	the	infinite	game	.
that	's	what	we	're	talking	about	.
you	see	,	technology	is	a	way	to	evolve	the	evolution	.
it	's	a	way	to	explore	possibilities	and	opportunities	and	create	more	.
and	it	's	actually	a	way	of	playing	the	game	,	of	playing	all	the	games	.
that	's	what	technology	wants	.
and	so	when	i	think	about	what	technology	wants	,	i	think	that	it	has	to	do	with	the	fact	that	every	person	here	--	and	i	really	believe	this	--	every	person	here	has	an	assignment	.	and	your	assignment	is	to	spend	your	life	discovering	what	your	assignment	is	.
that	recursive	nature	is	the	infinite	game	.
and	if	you	play	that	well	,	you	'll	have	other	people	involved	,	so	even	that	game	extends	and	continues	even	when	you	're	gone	.
that	is	the	infinite	game	.	and	what	technology	is	is	the	medium	in	which	we	play	that	infinite	game	.
and	so	i	think	that	we	should	embrace	technology	because	it	is	an	essential	part	of	our	journey	in	finding	out	who	we	are	.
thank	you	.
