every	year	in	the	united	states	alone	,	2,077,000	couples	make	a	legal	and	spiritual	decision	to	spend	the	rest	of	their	lives	together	...
and	not	to	have	sex	with	anyone	else	,	ever	.
he	buys	a	ring	,	she	buys	a	dress	.
they	go	shopping	for	all	sorts	of	things	.
she	takes	him	to	arthur	murray	for	ballroom	dancing	lessons	.
and	the	big	day	comes	.
and	they	'll	stand	before	god	and	family	and	some	guy	her	dad	once	did	business	with	,	and	they	'll	vow	that	nothing	,	not	abject	poverty	,	not	life	-	threatening	illness	,	not	complete	and	utter	misery	will	ever	put	the	tiniest	damper	on	their	eternal	love	and	devotion	.
these	optimistic	young	bastards	promise	to	honor	and	cherish	each	other	through	hot	flashes	and	mid	-	life	crises	and	a	cumulative	50	-	lb	.	weight	gain	,	until	that	far	-	off	day	when	one	of	them	is	finally	able	to	rest	in	peace	.
you	know	,	because	they	ca	n't	hear	the	snoring	anymore	.
and	then	they	'll	get	stupid	drunk	and	smash	cake	in	each	others	'	faces	and	do	the	``	macarena	,	``	and	we	'll	be	there	showering	them	with	towels	and	toasters	and	drinking	their	free	booze	and	throwing	birdseed	at	them	every	single	time	--	even	though	we	know	,	statistically	,	half	of	them	will	be	divorced	within	a	decade	.
of	course	,	the	other	half	wo	n't	,	right	?
they	'll	keep	forgetting	anniversaries	and	arguing	about	where	to	spend	holidays	and	debating	which	way	the	toilet	paper	should	come	off	of	the	roll	.
and	some	of	them	will	even	still	be	enjoying	each	others	'	company	when	neither	of	them	can	chew	solid	food	anymore	.
and	researchers	want	to	know	why	.
i	mean	,	look	,	it	does	n't	take	a	double	-	blind	,	placebo	-	controlled	study	to	figure	out	what	makes	a	marriage	not	work	.
disrespect	,	boredom	,	too	much	time	on	facebook	,	having	sex	with	other	people	.
but	you	can	have	the	exact	opposite	of	all	of	those	things	--	respect	,	excitement	,	a	broken	internet	connection	,	mind	-	numbing	monogamy	--	and	the	thing	still	can	go	to	hell	in	a	hand	basket	.
so	what	's	going	on	when	it	does	n't	?
what	do	the	folks	who	make	it	all	the	way	to	side	-	by	-	side	burial	plots	have	in	common	?
what	are	they	doing	right	?
what	can	we	learn	from	them	?
and	if	you	're	still	happily	sleeping	solo	,	why	should	you	stop	what	you	're	doing	and	make	it	your	life	's	work	to	find	that	one	special	person	that	you	can	annoy	for	the	rest	of	your	life	?
well	researchers	spend	billions	of	your	tax	dollars	trying	to	figure	that	out	.
they	stalk	blissful	couples	and	they	study	their	every	move	and	mannerism	.
and	they	try	to	pinpoint	what	it	is	that	sets	them	apart	from	their	miserable	neighbors	and	friends	.
and	it	turns	out	,	the	success	stories	share	a	few	similarities	,	actually	,	beyond	they	do	n't	have	sex	with	other	people	.
for	instance	,	in	the	happiest	marriages	,	the	wife	is	thinner	and	better	looking	than	the	husband	.
obvious	,	right	.
it	's	obvious	that	this	leads	to	marital	bliss	because	,	women	,	we	care	a	great	deal	about	being	thin	and	good	looking	,	whereas	men	mostly	care	about	sex	...
ideally	with	women	who	are	thinner	and	better	looking	than	they	are	.
the	beauty	of	this	research	though	is	that	no	one	is	suggesting	that	women	have	to	be	thin	to	be	happy	;	we	just	have	to	be	thinner	than	our	partners	.
so	instead	of	all	that	laborious	dieting	and	exercising	,	we	just	need	to	wait	for	them	to	get	fat	,	maybe	bake	a	few	pies	.
this	is	good	information	to	have	,	and	it	's	not	that	complicated	.
research	also	suggests	that	the	happiest	couples	are	the	ones	that	focus	on	the	positives	.
for	example	,	the	happy	wife	.
instead	of	pointing	out	her	husband	's	growing	gut	or	suggesting	he	go	for	a	run	,	she	might	say	,	``	wow	,	honey	,	thank	you	for	going	out	of	your	way	to	make	me	relatively	thinner	.	``	these	are	couples	who	can	find	good	in	any	situation	.
``	yeah	,	it	was	devastating	when	we	lost	everything	in	that	fire	,	but	it	's	kind	of	nice	sleeping	out	here	under	the	stars	,	and	it	's	a	good	thing	you	've	got	all	that	body	fat	to	keep	us	warm	.	``	one	of	my	favorite	studies	found	that	the	more	willing	a	husband	is	to	do	house	work	,	the	more	attractive	his	wife	will	find	him	.
because	we	needed	a	study	to	tell	us	this	.
but	here	's	what	's	going	on	here	.
the	more	attractive	she	finds	him	,	the	more	sex	they	have	;	the	more	sex	they	have	,	the	nicer	he	is	to	her	;	the	nicer	he	is	to	her	,	the	less	she	nags	him	about	leaving	wet	towels	on	the	bed	--	and	ultimately	,	they	live	happily	ever	after	.
in	other	words	,	men	,	you	might	want	to	pick	it	up	a	notch	in	the	domestic	department	.
here	's	an	interesting	one	.
one	study	found	that	people	who	smile	in	childhood	photographs	are	less	likely	to	get	a	divorce	.
this	is	an	actual	study	,	and	let	me	clarify	.
the	researchers	were	not	looking	at	documented	self	-	reports	of	childhood	happiness	or	even	studying	old	journals	.
the	data	were	based	entirely	on	whether	people	looked	happy	in	these	early	pictures	.
now	i	do	n't	know	how	old	all	of	you	are	,	but	when	i	was	a	kid	,	your	parents	took	pictures	with	a	special	kind	of	camera	that	held	something	called	film	,	and	,	by	god	,	film	was	expensive	.
they	did	n't	take	300	shots	of	you	in	that	rapid	-	fire	digital	video	mode	and	then	pick	out	the	nicest	,	smileyest	one	for	the	christmas	card	.
oh	no	.
they	dressed	you	up	,	they	lined	you	up	,	and	you	smiled	for	the	fucking	camera	like	they	told	you	to	or	you	could	kiss	your	birthday	party	goodbye	.
but	still	,	i	have	a	huge	pile	of	fake	happy	childhood	pictures	and	i	'm	glad	they	make	me	less	likely	than	some	people	to	get	a	divorce	.
so	what	else	can	you	do	to	safeguard	your	marriage	?
do	not	win	an	oscar	for	best	actress	.
i	'm	serious	.
bettie	davis	,	joan	crawford	,	hallie	berry	,	hillary	swank	,	sandra	bullock	,	reese	witherspoon	,	all	of	them	single	soon	after	taking	home	that	statue	.
they	actually	call	it	the	oscar	curse	.
it	is	the	marriage	kiss	of	death	and	something	that	should	be	avoided	.
and	it	's	not	just	successfully	starring	in	films	that	's	dangerous	.
it	turns	out	,	merely	watching	a	romantic	comedy	causes	relationship	satisfaction	to	plummet	.
apparently	,	the	bitter	realization	that	maybe	it	could	happen	to	us	,	but	it	obviously	has	n't	and	it	probably	never	will	,	makes	our	lives	seem	unbearably	grim	in	comparison	.
and	theoretically	,	i	suppose	if	we	opt	for	a	film	where	someone	gets	brutally	murdered	or	dies	in	a	fiery	car	crash	,	we	are	more	likely	to	walk	out	of	that	theater	feeling	like	we	've	got	it	pretty	good	.
drinking	alcohol	,	it	seems	,	is	bad	for	your	marriage	.
yeah	.
i	ca	n't	tell	you	anymore	about	that	one	because	i	stopped	reading	it	at	the	headline	.
but	here	's	a	scary	one	:	divorce	is	contagious	.
that	's	right	--	when	you	have	a	close	couple	friend	split	up	,	it	increases	your	chances	of	getting	a	divorce	by	75	percent	.
now	i	have	to	say	,	i	do	n't	get	this	one	at	all	.
my	husband	and	i	have	watched	quite	a	few	friends	divide	their	assets	and	then	struggle	with	being	our	age	and	single	in	an	age	of	sexting	and	viagra	and	eharmony	.
and	i	'm	thinking	they	've	done	more	for	my	marriage	than	a	lifetime	of	therapy	ever	could	.
so	now	you	may	be	wondering	,	why	does	anyone	get	married	ever	?
well	the	u.s.	federal	government	counts	more	than	a	thousand	legal	benefits	to	being	someone	's	spouse	--	a	list	that	includes	visitation	rights	in	jail	,	but	hopefully	you	'll	never	need	that	one	.
but	beyond	the	profound	federal	perks	,	married	people	make	more	money	.
we	're	healthier	,	physically	and	emotionally	.
we	produce	happier	,	more	stable	and	more	successful	kids	.
we	have	more	sex	than	our	supposedly	swinging	single	friends	--	believe	it	or	not	.
we	even	live	longer	,	which	is	a	pretty	compelling	argument	for	marrying	someone	you	like	a	lot	in	the	first	place	.
now	if	you	're	not	currently	experiencing	the	joy	of	the	joint	tax	return	,	i	ca	n't	tell	you	how	to	find	a	chore	-	loving	person	of	the	approximately	ideal	size	and	attractiveness	who	prefers	horror	movies	and	does	n't	have	a	lot	of	friends	hovering	on	the	brink	of	divorce	,	but	i	can	only	encourage	you	to	try	,	because	the	benefits	,	as	i	've	pointed	out	,	are	significant	.
the	bottom	line	is	,	whether	you	're	in	it	or	you	're	searching	for	it	,	i	believe	marriage	is	an	institution	worth	pursuing	and	protecting	.
so	i	hope	you	'll	use	the	information	i	've	given	you	today	to	weigh	your	personal	strengths	against	your	own	risk	factors	.
for	instance	,	in	my	marriage	,	i	'd	say	i	'm	doing	okay	.
one	the	one	hand	,	i	have	a	husband	who	's	annoyingly	lean	and	incredibly	handsome	.
so	i	'm	obviously	going	to	need	fatten	him	up	.
and	like	i	said	,	we	have	those	divorced	friends	who	may	secretly	or	subconsciously	be	trying	to	break	us	up	.
so	we	have	to	keep	an	eye	on	that	.
and	we	do	like	a	cocktail	or	two	.
on	the	other	hand	,	i	have	the	fake	happy	picture	thing	.
and	also	,	my	husband	does	a	lot	around	the	house	,	and	would	happily	never	see	another	romantic	comedy	as	long	as	he	lives	.
so	i	've	got	all	those	things	going	for	me	.
but	just	in	case	,	i	plan	to	work	extra	hard	to	not	win	an	oscar	anytime	soon	.
and	for	the	good	of	your	relationships	,	i	would	encourage	you	to	do	the	same	.
i	'll	see	you	at	the	bar	.
