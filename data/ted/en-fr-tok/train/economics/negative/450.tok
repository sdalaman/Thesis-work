right	when	i	was	15	was	when	i	first	got	interested	in	solar	energy	.
my	family	had	moved	from	fort	lee	,	new	jersey	to	california	,	and	we	moved	from	the	snow	to	lots	of	heat	,	and	gas	lines	.
there	was	gas	rationing	in	1973	.
the	energy	crisis	was	in	full	bore	.	i	started	reading	popular	science	magazine	,	and	i	got	really	excited	about	the	potential	of	solar	energy	to	try	and	solve	that	crisis	.
i	had	just	taken	trigonometry	in	high	school	,	i	learned	about	the	parabola	and	how	it	could	concentrate	rays	of	light	to	a	single	focus	.
that	got	me	very	excited	.
and	i	really	felt	that	there	would	be	potential	to	build	some	kind	of	thing	that	could	concentrate	light	.
so	,	i	started	this	company	called	solar	devices	.
and	this	was	a	company	where	i	built	parabolas	,	i	took	metal	shop	,	and	i	remember	walking	into	metal	shop	building	parabolas	and	stirling	engines	.
and	i	was	building	this	stirling	engine	over	on	the	lathe	,	and	all	the	biker	guys	--	motorcycle	guys	--	came	over	and	said	,	``	you	're	building	a	bong	,	are	n't	you	?	``
and	i	said	,	``	no	,	it	's	a	stirling	engine	.	it	really	is	.	``
but	they	did	n't	believe	me	.
i	sold	the	plans	for	this	engine	and	for	this	dish	in	the	back	of	popular	science	magazine	,	for	four	dollars	each	.
and	i	earned	enough	money	to	pay	for	my	first	year	of	caltech	.
it	was	a	really	big	excitement	for	me	to	get	into	caltech	.
and	my	first	year	at	caltech	,	i	continued	the	business	.
but	then	,	in	the	second	year	of	caltech	,	they	started	grading	.
the	whole	first	year	was	pass	/	fail	,	but	the	second	year	was	graded	.
i	was	n't	able	to	keep	up	with	the	business	,	and	i	ended	up	with	a	25	-	year	detour	.
my	dream	had	been	to	convert	solar	energy	at	a	very	practical	cost	,	but	then	i	had	this	big	detour	.
first	,	the	coursework	at	caltech	.
then	,	when	i	graduated	from	caltech	,	the	ibm	p.c	.	came	out	,	and	i	got	addicted	to	the	ibm	p.c	.	in	1981	.
and	then	in	1983	,	lotus	1-2-3	came	out	,	and	i	was	completely	blown	away	by	lotus	1-2-3	.
i	began	operating	my	business	with	1-2-3	,	began	writing	add	-	ins	for	1-2-3	,	wrote	a	natural	language	interface	to	1-2-3	.
i	started	an	educational	software	company	after	i	joined	lotus	,	and	then	i	started	idealab	so	i	could	have	a	roof	under	which	i	could	build	multiple	companies	in	succession
then	,	much	much	later	--	in	2000	,	very	recently	--	the	new	california	energy	crisis	--	or	what	was	purported	to	be	a	big	energy	crisis	--	was	coming	.
and	i	was	trying	to	figure	if	there	was	some	way	we	could	build	something	that	would	capitalize	on	that	and	try	and	get	people	back	-	up	energy	,	in	case	the	crisis	really	came	.
and	i	started	looking	at	how	we	could	build	battery	back	-	up	systems	that	could	give	people	five	hours	,	10	hours	,	maybe	even	a	full	day	,	or	three	days	'	worth	of	back	-	up	power	.
i	'm	glad	you	heard	earlier	today	,	batteries	are	unbelievably	energy	--	lack	of	density	compared	to	fuel	.
so	much	more	energy	can	be	stored	with	fuel	than	with	batteries	.
you	'd	have	to	fill	your	entire	parking	space	of	one	garage	space	just	to	give	yourself	four	hours	of	battery	back	-	up	.
and	i	concluded	,	after	researching	every	other	technology	that	we	could	deploy	for	storing	energy	--	flywheels	,	different	formulations	of	batteries	--	it	just	was	n't	practical	to	store	energy	.
so	what	about	making	energy	?
maybe	we	could	make	energy	.
i	tried	to	figure	out	--	maybe	solar	's	become	attractive	.
it	's	been	25	years	since	i	was	doing	this	,	let	me	go	back	and	look	at	what	's	been	happening	with	solar	cells	.
and	the	price	had	gone	down	from	10	dollars	a	watt	to	about	four	or	five	dollars	a	watt	,	but	it	stabilized	.
and	it	really	needed	to	get	much	lower	than	that	to	be	cost	effective	.
i	studied	all	the	new	things	that	had	happened	in	solar	cells	,	and	was	trying	to	look	for	ways	we	could	innovate	and	make	solar	cells	more	inexpensively	.
there	are	a	lot	of	new	things	that	are	happening	to	do	that	,	but	fundamentally	the	process	requires	a	tremendous	amount	of	energy	.
some	people	even	say	it	takes	more	energy	to	make	a	solar	cell	than	it	will	give	out	in	its	entire	life	.
hopefully	,	if	we	can	reduce	the	amount	of	energy	it	takes	to	make	the	cells	,	that	will	become	more	practical	.
but	right	now	,	you	pretty	much	have	to	take	silicon	,	put	it	in	an	oven	at	1600	degrees	fahrenheit	for	17	hours	,	to	make	the	cells	.
a	lot	of	people	are	working	on	things	to	try	and	reduce	that	,	but	i	did	n't	have	anything	to	contribute	in	that	area	.
so	i	tried	to	figure	out	what	other	way	could	we	try	and	make	cost	-	effective	solar	electricity	.
so	i	thought	of	an	idea	--	what	if	we	collect	the	sun	with	a	large	reflector	--
like	i	had	been	thinking	about	way	back	when	,	when	i	was	in	high	school	--
but	maybe	with	modern	technology	we	could	make	a	cheaper	,	large	collector	,	concentrate	it	to	a	small	converter	,	and	then	the	conversion	device	would	n't	have	to	be	as	expensive	,	because	it	's	much	smaller	,	rather	than	solar	cells	,	which	have	to	be	covering	the	entire	surface	area	that	you	want	to	gather	sun	from	.
this	seemed	practical	now	,	because	a	lot	of	new	technologies	had	come	in	the	25	years	since	i	had	last	looked	at	it	.
first	of	all	,	there	was	a	lot	of	new	manufacturing	techniques	,	not	to	mention	really	cheap	miniature	motors	--	brushless	motors	,	servo	motors	,	stepper	motors	,	that	are	used	in	printers	and	scanners	and	things	like	that	.
so	,	that	's	a	breakthrough	.
of	course	,	inexpensive	microprocessors	and	then	a	very	important	breakthrough	--	genetic	algorithms	.
i	'll	be	very	short	on	genetic	algorithms	.
it	's	a	powerful	way	of	solving	intractable	problems	using	natural	selection	.
you	take	a	problem	that	you	ca	n't	solve	with	a	pure	mathematical	answer	,	you	build	an	evolutionary	system	to	try	multiple	tries	at	guessing	,	you	add	sex	--	where	you	take	half	of	one	solution	and	half	of	another	and	then	make	new	mutations	--	and	you	use	natural	selection	to	kill	off	not	as	good	solutions	.
usually	,	with	a	genetic	algorithm	on	a	computer	today	,	with	a	three	gigahertz	processor	you	can	solve	many	,	many	formerly	intractable	problems	in	just	a	matter	of	minutes	.
we	tried	to	come	up	with	a	way	to	use	genetic	algorithms	to	create	a	new	type	of	concentrator	.
and	i	'll	show	you	what	we	came	up	with	.
traditionally	,	concentrators	look	like	this	.
those	shapes	are	parabolas	.
they	take	all	the	parallel	incoming	rays	and	focus	it	to	a	single	spot	.
they	have	to	track	the	sun	,	because	they	have	to	be	pointing	directly	at	the	sun	.
they	usually	have	about	a	one	degree	acceptance	angle	,
meaning	once	they	're	more	than	about	a	degree	off	,	none	of	the	sunlight	rays	will	hit	the	focus	.
so	we	tried	to	come	up	with	a	way	of	making	a	non	-	tracking	collector	,	a	collector	that	would	gather	much	more	than	one	degree	of	light	,	with	no	moving	parts	.
so	we	created	this	genetic	algorithm	to	try	this	out	,	we	made	a	model	in	xl	of	a	multi	-	surface	reflector	,	and	an	amazing	thing	evolved	,	literally	evolved	,	from	trying	a	billion	cycles	,	a	billion	different	attempts	,	with	a	fitness	function	that	defined	how	can	you	collect	the	most	light	,	from	the	most	angles	,	over	a	day	,	from	the	sun	.
and	this	is	the	shape	that	evolved	.
it	's	this	non	-	tracking	collector	with	these	six	tuba	-	like	horns	,	and	each	of	them	collect	light	in	the	following	way	--	if	the	sunlight	strikes	right	here	,	it	might	bounce	right	to	the	center	,	the	hot	spot	,	directly	,	but	if	the	sun	is	off	-	axis	and	comes	from	the	side	,	it	might	hit	two	places	and	take	two	bounces	.
so	for	direct	light	,	it	takes	only	one	bounce	,	for	off	-	axis	light	it	might	take	two	,	and	for	extreme	off	-	axis	,	it	might	take	three	.
your	efficiency	goes	down	with	more	bounces	,	because	you	lose	about	10	percent	with	each	bounce	,
but	this	allowed	us	to	collect	light	from	a	plus	or	minus	25	degree	angle	.
so	,	about	two	and	a	half	hours	of	the	day	we	could	collect	with	a	stationary	component	.
solar	cells	collect	light	for	four	and	a	half	hours	though	.
on	an	average	adjusted	day	,	a	solar	cell	--
because	the	sun	's	moving	across	the	sky	,	the	solar	cell	is	going	down	with	a	sine	wave	function	of	performance	at	the	off	-	axis	angles	.
it	collects	about	four	and	a	half	average	hours	of	sunlight	a	day	.
so	,	even	this	,	although	it	was	great	with	no	moving	parts	--	we	could	achieve	high	temperatures	--	was	n't	enough	.
we	needed	to	beat	solar	cells	.
so	we	took	a	look	at	another	idea	.
we	looked	at	a	way	to	break	up	a	parabola	into	individual	petals	that	would	track	.
so	what	you	see	here	is	12	separate	petals	,	that	each	could	be	controlled	with	individual	microprocessors	that	would	only	cost	a	dollar	.
you	can	buy	a	two	megahertz	microprocessor	for	a	dollar	now	.
and	you	can	buy	stepper	motors	that	pretty	much	never	wear	out	because	they	have	no	brushes	,	for	a	dollar	.
we	can	control	all	12	of	these	petals	for	under	50	dollars	and	what	this	would	allow	us	to	do	is	not	have	to	move	the	focus	any	more	,	but	only	move	the	petals	.
the	whole	system	would	have	a	much	lower	profile	,	but	also	we	could	gather	sunlight	for	six	and	a	half	to	seven	hours	a	day	.
now	that	we	have	concentrated	sunlight	,	what	are	we	going	to	put	at	the	center	to	convert	sunlight	to	electricity	?
so	we	tried	to	look	at	all	the	different	heat	engines	that	have	been	used	in	history	to	try	and	convert	sunlight	to	electricity	,	or	heat	to	electricity	.
and	one	of	the	great	ones	of	all	time	,	james	watt	's	steam	engine	of	1788	was	a	major	,	major	breakthrough	.
james	watt	did	n't	actually	invent	the	steam	engine	,	he	just	refined	it	.
but	,	his	refinements	were	incredible	.
he	added	new	linear	motion	guides	to	the	pistons	,	he	added	a	condenser	to	cool	the	steam	outside	the	cylinder	,	he	made	the	engine	double	-	acting	so	it	had	double	the	power	.
those	were	major	breakthroughs	.
i	mean	,	all	of	the	improvements	he	made	--
and	it	's	justifiable	that	our	measure	of	energy	,	the	watt	,	today	is	named	after	him	.
so	we	looked	at	this	engine	,	and	this	had	some	potential	.
steam	engines	are	dangerous	,	and	they	had	tremendous	impact	on	the	world	,	as	you	know	--	industrial	revolution	and	ships	and	locomotives	.
but	they	're	usually	good	to	be	large	,	so	they	're	not	good	for	distributed	power	generation	.
but	they	're	also	very	high	pressure	,	so	they	're	dangerous	.
another	type	of	engine	is	the	hot	air	engine	.
and	the	hot	air	engine	also	was	not	invented	by	robert	stirling	,	but	robert	stirling	came	along	in	1816	and	radically	improved	it	.
this	engine	,	because	it	was	so	interesting	--	it	only	worked	on	air	,	no	steam	--	has	led	to	hundreds	of	creative	designs	over	the	years	that	use	the	stirling	engine	principle	.
but	after	the	stirling	engine	,	otto	came	along	,	and	also	,	he	did	n't	invent	the	internal	combustion	engine	,	he	just	refined	it	.
he	showed	it	in	paris	in	1867	,	and	it	was	a	major	achievement	because	it	brought	the	power	density	of	the	engine	way	up	.
you	could	now	get	a	lot	more	power	in	a	lot	smaller	space	,	and	that	allowed	the	engine	to	be	used	for	mobile	applications	.
so	,	once	you	have	mobility	,	now	you	're	making	a	lot	of	engines	because	you	've	got	lots	of	units	,	as	opposed	to	steam	ships	or	big	factories	where	you	're	not	making	as	many	units	,	so	this	was	the	engine	that	ended	up	benefiting	from	mass	production	where	all	the	other	engines	did	n't	benefit	.
so	,	because	it	went	into	mass	production	,	costs	were	reduced	,	100	years	of	refinement	,	emissions	were	reduced	,	tremendous	production	value	.
there	have	been	hundreds	of	millions	of	internal	combustion	engines	built	,	compared	to	thousands	of	stirling	engines	built	.
and	not	nearly	as	many	small	steam	engines	being	built	anymore	,	only	large	ones	for	big	operations	.
so	after	looking	at	these	three	,	and	47	others	,	we	concluded	that	the	stirling	engine	would	be	the	best	one	to	use	.
i	want	to	give	you	a	brief	explanation	of	how	we	looked	at	it	and	how	it	works	.
so	we	tried	to	look	at	the	stirling	engine	in	a	new	way	,	because	it	was	practical	--	weight	no	longer	mattered	for	our	application
the	internal	combustion	engine	took	off	because	weight	mattered	because	you	were	moving	around	.
but	if	you	're	trying	to	generate	solar	energy	in	a	static	place	the	weight	does	n't	matter	so	much	.
the	other	thing	we	discovered	is	that	efficiency	does	n't	matter	so	much	if	your	energy	source	is	free	.
normally	,	efficiency	is	crucial	because	the	fuel	cost	of	your	engine	over	its	life	dwarfs	the	cost	of	the	engine	.
but	if	your	fuel	source	is	free	,	then	the	only	thing	that	matters	is	the	up	-	front	capital	cost	of	the	engine	.
so	you	do	n't	want	to	optimize	for	efficiency	,	you	want	to	optimize	for	power	per	dollar	.
so	using	that	new	twist	,	with	the	new	criteria	,	we	thought	we	could	re	-	look	at	the	stirling	engine	,	and	also	bring	genetic	algorithms	in	.
basically	,	robert	stirling	did	n't	have	gordon	moore	before	him	to	get	us	three	gigahertz	of	processor	power	.
so	we	took	the	same	genetic	algorithm	that	we	used	earlier	to	make	that	concentrator	,	which	did	n't	work	out	for	us	,	to	optimize	the	stirling	engine	,	and	make	its	design	sizes	and	all	of	its	dimensions	the	exact	optimum	to	get	the	most	power	per	dollar	,	irrespective	of	weight	,	irrespective	of	size	,	to	get	the	most	conversion	of	solar	energy	,	because	the	sun	is	free	.
and	that	's	the	process	we	took	--	let	me	show	you	how	the	engine	works	.
the	simplest	heat	engine	,	or	hot	air	engine	,	of	all	time	would	be	this	--	take	a	box	,	a	steel	canister	,	with	a	piston	.
put	a	flame	under	it	,	the	piston	moves	up	.
take	it	off	the	flame	and	pour	water	on	it	,	or	let	it	cool	down	,	the	piston	moves	down	.
that	's	a	heat	engine	.
that	's	basically	the	most	fundamental	heat	engine	you	could	possibly	have	.
the	problem	is	the	efficiency	is	one	hundredth	of	one	percent	,	because	you	're	heating	all	the	metal	of	the	chamber	and	then	cooling	all	the	metal	of	the	chamber	each	time	.
and	you	're	only	getting	power	from	the	air	that	's	heating	at	the	same	time	,	but	you	're	wasting	all	the	energy	heating	the	metal	and	cooling	the	metal	.
so	someone	came	up	with	a	very	clever	idea	,
to	--	instead	of	heating	the	whole	cylinder	and	cooling	the	whole	cylinder	,	what	about	if	you	put	a	displacer	inside	--	a	little	thing	that	shuttles	the	air	back	and	forth	.
you	move	that	up	and	down	with	a	little	bit	of	energy	but	now	you	're	only	shifting	the	air	down	to	the	hot	end	and	up	to	the	cold	end	,	down	to	the	hot	end	and	up	to	the	cold	end	.
so	,	now	you	're	not	alternately	heating	and	cooling	the	metal	,	you	're	just	alternately	heating	and	cooling	the	air	.
that	allows	you	to	get	the	efficiency	up	from	a	hundredth	of	a	percent	to	about	two	percent	.
and	then	robert	stirling	came	along	with	this	genius	idea	,	which	was	,	well	i	'm	still	not	heating	the	metal	now	,	with	this	kind	of	engine	,	but	i	'm	still	reheating	all	the	air	.
i	'm	still	heating	the	air	every	time	and	cooling	the	air	every	time	.
what	about	if	i	put	a	thermal	sponge	in	the	middle	,	in	the	passageway	between	where	the	air	has	to	move	between	hot	and	cold	?
so	he	made	fine	wires	,	and	cracked	glass	,	and	all	different	kinds	of	materials	to	be	a	heat	sponge	.
so	when	the	air	pushes	up	to	go	from	the	hot	end	to	the	cold	end	,	it	puts	some	heat	into	the	sponge	.
and	then	when	the	air	comes	back	after	it	's	been	cooled	it	picks	up	that	heat	again	.
so	you	're	reusing	your	energy	five	or	six	times	,	and	that	brings	the	efficiency	up	between	30	and	40	percent
it	's	a	little	known	,	but	brilliant	,	genius	invention	of	robert	stirling	that	takes	the	hot	air	engine	from	being	somewhat	impractical	--	like	i	found	out	when	i	made	the	real	simple	version	in	high	school	--	to	very	potentially	possible	,	once	you	get	the	efficiency	up	,	if	you	can	design	this	to	be	low	enough	cost	.
so	we	really	set	out	on	a	path	to	try	and	make	the	lowest	cost	possible	.
we	built	a	huge	mathematical	model	of	how	a	stirling	engine	works	.
we	applied	the	genetic	algorithm	.
we	got	the	results	from	that	for	the	optimal	engine	.
we	built	engines	--	so	we	built	100	different	engines	over	the	last	two	years	.
we	measured	each	one	,	we	readjusted	the	model	to	what	we	measured	,	and	then	we	led	that	to	the	current	prototype	.
it	led	to	a	very	compact	,	inexpensive	engine	,	and	this	is	what	the	engine	looks	like	.
let	me	show	you	what	it	looks	like	in	real	life	.
so	this	is	the	engine	.
it	's	just	a	small	cylinder	down	here	which	holds	the	generator	inside	and	all	the	linkage	and	it	's	the	hot	cap	--	the	hot	cylinder	on	the	top	--	this	part	gets	hot	,	this	part	is	cool	,	and	electricity	comes	out	.
the	exact	converse	is	also	true	.
if	you	put	electricity	in	,	this	will	get	hot	and	this	will	get	cold	,	you	get	refrigeration	.
so	it	's	a	complete	reversible	cycle	,	a	very	efficient	cycle	,	and	quite	a	simple	thing	to	make	.
so	now	you	put	the	two	things	together	.
so	you	have	the	engine	,	now	what	if	you	combine	the	petals	and	the	engine	in	the	center	?
the	petals	track	and	the	engine	gets	the	concentrated	sunlight	,	take	that	heat	and	turn	it	into	electricity	.
this	is	what	the	first	prototype	of	our	system	looked	like	together	with	the	petals	and	the	engine	in	the	center	.
this	is	being	run	out	in	the	sun	,	and	now	i	want	to	show	you	what	the	actual	thing	looks	like	.
thank	you	.
so	this	is	a	unit	with	the	12	petals
these	petals	cost	about	a	dollar	each	--	they	're	lightweight	,	injection	molded	plastic	,	aluminized	.
the	mechanism	to	control	each	petal	is	below	there	with	a	microprocessor	on	each	one	.
there	are	thermocouples	on	the	engine	--	little	sensors	that	detect	the	heat	when	the	sunlight	strikes	them	.
each	petal	adjusts	itself	separately	to	keep	the	highest	temperature	on	it	.
when	the	sun	comes	out	in	the	morning	,	the	petals	will	seek	the	sun	,	find	it	by	searching	for	the	highest	temperature
about	a	minute	and	a	half	or	two	minutes	after	the	rays	are	striking	the	hot	cap	the	engine	will	be	warm	enough	to	start	and	then	the	engine	will	generate	electricity	for	about	six	and	a	half	hours	a	day	--	six	and	a	half	to	seven	hours	as	the	sun	moves	across	the	sky
a	critical	part	that	we	can	take	advantage	of	is	that	we	have	these	inexpensive	microprocessors	and	each	one	of	these	petals	are	autonomous	,	and	each	one	of	these	petals	figures	out	where	the	sun	is	with	no	user	set	-	up	.
so	you	do	n't	have	to	tell	what	latitude	,	longitude	you	're	at	,	you	do	n't	have	to	tell	what	your	roof	slope	angle	is	,	you	do	n't	have	to	tell	what	orientation	.
it	does	n't	really	care	.
what	it	does	is	it	searches	to	find	the	hottest	spot	,	it	searches	again	a	half	an	hour	later	,	it	searches	again	a	day	later	,	it	searches	again	a	month	later	.
it	basically	figures	out	where	on	earth	you	are	by	watching	the	direction	the	sun	moves	,	so	you	do	n't	have	to	actually	enter	anything	about	that	.
the	way	the	unit	works	is	,	when	the	sun	comes	out	the	engine	will	start	and	you	get	power	out	here	.
we	have	a.c.	and	d.c.	,	get	12	volts	d.c.	,	so	that	could	be	used	for	certain	applications	.
we	have	an	inverter	in	there	,	so	you	get	117	volts	a.c.	and	you	also	get	hot	water	.
the	hot	water	's	optional	.
you	do	n't	have	to	use	the	hot	water	,	it	will	cool	itself	.
but	you	can	use	it	to	optionally	heat	hot	water	and	that	brings	the	efficiency	up	even	higher	because	some	of	the	heat	that	you	would	normally	be	rejecting	,	you	can	now	use	as	useful	energy	,	whether	it	's	for	a	pool	or	hot	water	.
let	me	show	you	a	quick	movie	of	what	this	looks	like	running	.
so	this	is	the	first	test	where	we	took	it	outside	and	each	of	the	petals	were	individually	seeking	.
and	what	they	do	is	step	,	very	coarsely	at	first	,	and	then	very	finely	afterward	.
once	they	get	a	temperature	reading	on	the	thermocouple	indicating	they	found	the	sun	,	then	they	slow	down	and	do	a	fine	search	,	then	all	the	petals	will	move	into	position	,	and	then	the	engine	will	start	.
so	,	we	've	been	working	on	this	for	the	last	two	years	.
we	're	very	excited	about	the	progress	,	we	do	have	a	very	long	way	to	go	though	still	,	and	let	me	tell	you	a	little	bit	more	about	that	.
this	is	how	we	envision	it	would	be	in	a	residential	installation	:	you	'd	probably	have	more	than	one	unit	on	your	roof	.
it	could	be	on	your	roof	,	or	in	your	backyard	,	or	somewhere	else	.
you	do	n't	have	to	have	enough	units	to	power	your	entire	house	,	you	just	save	money	with	each	incremental	one	you	add	.
so	you	're	still	using	the	grid	potentially	,	in	this	type	of	application	,	to	be	your	back	-	up	supply	--	of	course	,	you	ca	n't	use	these	at	night	,	and	you	ca	n't	use	these	on	cloudy	days	.
but	by	reducing	your	energy	use	,	pretty	much	at	the	peak	times	--	usually	when	you	have	you	air	conditioning	on	,	or	other	times	like	that	--	this	generates	the	peak	power	at	the	peak	usage	time	,	so	it	's	very	complementary	in	that	sense	.
this	is	how	we	would	envision	a	residential	application	.
we	also	think	there	's	very	big	potential	for	energy	farms	,	especially	in	remote	land	where	there	happens	to	be	a	lot	of	sun	.
it	's	a	really	good	combination	of	those	two	factors	.
it	turns	out	there	's	a	lot	of	powerful	sun	all	around	the	world	,	obviously	,	but	in	special	places	where	it	happens	to	be	relatively	inexpensive	to	place	these	and	also	in	many	more	places	where	there	is	high	wind	power	.
so	an	example	of	that	is	,	here	's	the	map	of	the	united	states	.
pretty	much	everywhere	that	's	not	green	or	blue	is	a	really	ideal	place	,	but	even	the	green	or	blue	areas	are	good	,	just	not	as	good	as	the	places	that	are	red	,	orange	and	yellow	.
but	the	hot	sport	right	around	las	vegas	and	death	valley	and	that	area	is	very	,	very	good	.
and	all	this	does	is	affect	the	payback	period	,	it	does	n't	mean	that	you	could	n't	use	solar	energy	;	you	could	use	solar	energy	anywhere	on	earth	.
it	just	affects	the	payback	period	if	you	're	comparing	to	grid	-	supplied	electricity	.
but	if	you	do	n't	have	grid	-	supplied	electricity	,	then	the	whole	question	of	payback	is	a	different	one	entirely	.
it	's	just	how	many	watts	do	you	get	per	dollar	,	and	how	could	you	benefit	from	that	using	that	power	to	change	your	life	in	some	way	.
this	is	the	map	of	the	united	states	.
this	is	the	map	of	the	whole	earth
and	again	,	you	can	see	a	huge	swathe	in	the	middle	of	pretty	much	where	a	large	part	of	the	population	is	,	there	's	tremendous	chances	for	solar	energy	.
and	of	course	,	look	at	africa	.
it	's	just	unbelievable	what	the	potential	is	to	take	advantage	of	solar	energy	there	,	and	i	'm	really	excited	to	talk	more	about	finding	ways	we	can	help	with	that	.
so	,	in	conclusion	,	i	would	say	my	journey	has	shown	me	that	you	can	revisit	old	ideas	in	a	new	light	,	and	sometimes	ideas	that	have	been	discarded	in	the	past	can	be	practical	now	if	you	apply	some	new	technology	or	new	twists	.
we	believe	we	're	getting	very	close	to	something	practical	and	affordable	.
our	short	-	term	goal	for	this	is	to	be	half	the	price	of	solar	cells	and	our	longer	-	term	goal	is	to	be	less	than	a	five	-	year	payback	.
and	at	less	than	a	five	-	year	payback	,	all	of	a	sudden	this	becomes	very	economic
so	you	do	n't	have	to	just	want	to	have	a	feel	-	good	attitude	about	energy	to	want	to	have	one	of	these	.
it	just	makes	economic	sense	.
right	now	,	solar	paybacks	are	between	30	and	50	years	.
if	you	get	it	down	below	five	years	then	it	becomes	almost	a	no	-	brainer	because	the	interest	to	own	it	--	someone	else	will	finance	it	for	you	and	you	can	just	make	money	,	basically	from	day	one	.
so	that	's	our	real	powerful	goal	that	we	're	really	shooting	for	in	the	company	.
two	other	things	that	i	learned	that	were	very	surprising	to	me	--	one	was	how	casual	we	are	about	energy	.
i	was	walking	from	the	elevator	over	here	,	and	even	just	looking	at	the	stage	right	now	--	so	there	's	probably	20	500	watt	lights	right	now	.
there	's	10,000	watts	of	light	pouring	on	the	stage	,	one	horsepower	is	756	watts	,	at	full	power	.
so	there	's	basically	15	horses	running	at	full	speed	just	to	keep	the	stage	lit	.
not	to	mention	the	200	horses	that	are	probably	running	right	now	to	keep	the	airconditioning	going	.
and	it	's	just	amazing	,	walk	in	the	elevator	and	there	's	lights	on	in	the	elevator	.
of	course	,	now	i	'm	very	sensitive	at	home	when	we	leave	the	lights	on	by	mistake	.
but	,	everywhere	around	us	we	have	insatiable	use	for	energy	because	it	's	so	cheap	.
and	it	's	cheap	because	we	've	been	subsidized	by	energy	that	's	been	concentrated	by	the	sun	.
basically	,	oil	is	solar	energy	concentrate	.
it	's	been	pounded	for	a	billion	years	with	a	lot	of	energy	to	make	it	have	all	that	energy	contained	in	it	.
and	we	do	n't	have	a	birthright	to	just	use	that	up	as	fast	as	we	are	,	i	think	.
and	it	would	be	great	if	we	could	find	a	way	to	make	our	energy	usage	renewable	,	where	as	we	're	using	the	energy	we	're	creating	it	at	the	same	pace	,	and	i	really	hope	we	can	get	there	.
thank	you	very	much	,	you	've	been	a	great	audience	.
