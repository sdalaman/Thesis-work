why	do	so	many	people	reach	success	and	then	fail	?
one	of	the	big	reasons	is	,	we	think	success	is	a	one	-	way	street	.
so	we	do	everything	that	leads	up	to	success	,
but	then	we	get	there	.	we	figure	we	've	made	it	,	we	sit	back	in	our	comfort	zone	,	and	we	actually	stop	doing	everything	that	made	us	successful	.
and	it	does	n't	take	long	to	go	downhill	.
and	i	can	tell	you	this	happens	,
because	it	happened	to	me	.
reaching	success	,	i	worked	hard	,	i	pushed	myself	.
but	then	i	stopped	,	because	i	figured	,	``	oh	,	you	know	,	i	made	it	.
i	can	just	sit	back	and	relax	.	``
reaching	success	,	i	always	tried	to	improve	and	do	good	work	.
but	then	i	stopped	because	i	figured	,	``	hey	,	i	'm	good	enough	.
i	do	n't	need	to	improve	any	more	.	``
reaching	success	,	i	was	pretty	good	at	coming	up	with	good	ideas	.
because	i	did	all	these	simple	things	that	led	to	ideas	.
but	then	i	stopped	,	because	i	figured	i	was	this	hot	-	shot	guy	and	i	should	n't	have	to	work	at	ideas	,	they	should	just	come	like	magic	.
and	the	only	thing	that	came	was	creative	block	.
i	could	n't	come	up	with	any	ideas	.
reaching	success	,	i	always	focused	on	clients	and	projects	,	and	ignored	the	money	.	then	all	this	money	started	pouring	in	.
and	i	got	distracted	by	it	.
and	suddenly	i	was	on	the	phone	to	my	stockbroker	and	my	real	estate	agent	,	when	i	should	have	been	talking	to	my	clients	.
and	reaching	success	,	i	always	did	what	i	loved	.
but	then	i	got	into	stuff	that	i	did	n't	love	,	like	management	.	i	am	the	world	's	worst	manager	,
but	i	figured	i	should	be	doing	it	,	because	i	was	,	after	all	,	the	president	of	the	company	.
well	,	soon	a	black	cloud	formed	over	my	head	and	here	i	was	,	outwardly	very	successful	,	but	inwardly	very	depressed	.
but	i	'm	a	guy	;	i	knew	how	to	fix	it	.
i	bought	a	fast	car	.
it	did	n't	help	.
i	was	faster	but	just	as	depressed	.
so	i	went	to	my	doctor	.	i	said	,	``	doc	,	i	can	buy	anything	i	want	.	but	i	'm	not	happy	.	i	'm	depressed	.
it	's	true	what	they	say	,	and	i	did	n't	believe	it	until	it	happened	to	me	.
but	money	ca	n't	buy	happiness	.	``
he	said	,	``	no	.	but	it	can	buy	prozac	.	``
and	he	put	me	on	anti	-	depressants	.
and	yeah	,	the	black	cloud	faded	a	little	bit	,	but	so	did	all	the	work	,
because	i	was	just	floating	along	.	i	could	n't	care	less	if	clients	ever	called	.
and	clients	did	n't	call	.
because	they	could	see	i	was	no	longer	serving	them	,	i	was	only	serving	myself	.
so	they	took	their	money	and	their	projects	to	others	who	would	serve	them	better	.
well	,	it	did	n't	take	long	for	business	to	drop	like	a	rock	.
my	partner	and	i	,	thom	,	we	had	to	let	all	our	employees	go	.
it	was	down	to	just	the	two	of	us	,	and	we	were	about	to	go	under	.
and	that	was	great	.
because	with	no	employees	,	there	was	nobody	for	me	to	manage	.
so	i	went	back	to	doing	the	projects	i	loved	.
i	had	fun	again	,	i	worked	harder	and	,	to	cut	a	long	story	short	,	did	all	the	things	that	took	me	back	up	to	success	.
but	it	was	n't	a	quick	trip	.
it	took	seven	years	.
but	in	the	end	,	business	grew	bigger	than	ever	.
and	when	i	went	back	to	following	these	eight	principles	,	the	black	cloud	over	my	head	disappeared	altogether	.
and	i	woke	up	one	day	and	i	said	,	``	i	do	n't	need	prozac	anymore	.	``
and	i	threw	it	away	and	have	n't	needed	it	since	.
i	learned	that	success	is	n't	a	one	-	way	street	.
it	does	n't	look	like	this	;	it	really	looks	more	like	this	.
it	's	a	continuous	journey	.
and	if	we	want	to	avoid	``	success	-	to	-	failure	-	syndrome	,	``
we	just	keep	following	these	eight	principles	,
because	that	is	not	only	how	we	achieve	success	,	it	's	how	we	sustain	it	.
so	here	is	to	your	continued	success	.
