i	am	honored	to	be	here	,	and	i	'm	honored	to	talk	about	this	topic	,	which	i	think	is	of	grave	importance	.
we	've	been	talking	a	lot	about	the	horrific	impacts	of	plastic	on	the	planet	and	on	other	species	,	but	plastic	hurts	people	too	,	especially	poor	people	.
and	both	in	the	production	of	plastic	,	the	use	of	plastic	and	the	disposal	of	plastic	,	the	people	who	have	the	bull	's	-	eye	on	their	foreheads	are	poor	people	.
people	got	very	upset	when	the	bp	oil	spill	happened	for	very	good	reason	.
people	thought	about	,	``	oh	,	my	god	.
this	is	terrible	,	this	oil	--	it	's	in	the	water	.
it	's	going	to	destroy	the	living	systems	there	.
people	are	going	to	be	hurt	.
this	is	a	terrible	thing	,	that	the	oil	is	going	to	hurt	the	people	in	the	gulf	.	``
what	people	do	n't	think	about	is	:	what	if	the	oil	had	made	it	safely	to	shore	?
what	if	the	oil	actually	got	where	it	was	trying	to	go	?
not	only	would	it	have	been	burned	in	engines	and	added	to	global	warming	,	but	there	's	a	place	called	``	cancer	alley	,	``	and	the	reason	it	's	called	``	cancer	alley	``	is	because	the	petrochemical	industry	takes	that	oil	and	turns	it	into	plastic	and	,	in	the	process	,	kills	people	.
it	shortens	the	lives	of	the	people	who	live	there	in	the	gulf	.
so	oil	and	petrochemicals	are	not	just	a	problem	where	there	's	a	spill	;	they	're	a	problem	where	there	's	not	.
and	what	we	do	n't	often	appreciate	is	the	price	that	poor	people	pay	for	us	to	have	these	disposable	products	.
the	other	thing	that	we	do	n't	often	appreciate	is	it	's	not	just	at	the	point	of	production	that	poor	people	suffer	.
poor	people	also	suffer	at	the	point	of	use	.
those	of	us	who	earn	a	certain	income	level	,	we	have	something	called	choice	.
the	reason	why	you	want	to	work	hard	and	have	a	job	and	not	be	poor	and	broke	is	so	you	can	have	choices	,	economic	choices	.
we	actually	get	a	chance	to	choose	not	to	use	products	that	have	dangerous	,	poisonous	plastic	in	them	.
other	people	who	are	poor	do	n't	have	those	choices	.
so	low	-	income	people	often	are	the	ones	who	are	buying	the	products	that	have	those	dangerous	chemicals	in	them	that	their	children	are	using	.
those	are	the	people	who	wind	up	actually	ingesting	a	disproportionate	amount	of	this	poisonous	plastic	and	using	it	.
and	people	say	,	``	well	,	they	should	just	buy	a	different	product	.	``
well	,	the	problem	with	being	poor	is	you	do	n't	have	those	choices	.
you	often	have	to	buy	the	cheapest	products	.
the	cheapest	products	are	often	the	most	dangerous	.
and	if	that	were	n't	bad	enough	,	if	it	was	n't	just	the	production	of	plastic	that	's	giving	people	cancer	in	places	like	``	cancer	alley	``	and	shortening	lives	and	hurting	poor	kids	at	the	point	of	use	,	at	the	point	of	disposal	,	once	again	,	it	's	poor	people	who	bear	the	burden	.
often	,	we	think	we	're	doing	a	good	thing	.
you	're	in	your	office	,	and	you	're	drinking	your	bottled	water	,	or	whatever	it	is	,	and	you	think	to	yourself	,	``	hey	,	i	'm	going	to	throw	this	away	.
no	,	i	'm	going	to	be	virtuous	.
i	'm	going	to	put	it	in	the	blue	bin	.	``
you	think	,	``	i	put	mine	in	the	blue	bin	,	``
and	then	you	look	at	your	colleague	and	say	,	``	why	,	you	cretin	.
you	put	yours	in	the	white	bin	.	``
and	we	use	that	as	a	moral	tickle	.
we	feel	so	good	about	ourselves	.
maybe	i	'll	feel	good	myself	.
not	you	,	but	i	feel	this	way	.
and	so	we	kind	of	have	this	kind	of	moral	feel	-	good	moment	.
but	if	we	were	to	be	able	to	follow	that	little	bottle	on	its	journey	,	we	would	be	shocked	to	discover	that	,	all	too	often	,	that	bottle	is	going	to	be	put	on	a	boat	,
it	's	going	to	go	all	the	way	across	the	ocean	at	some	expense	,
and	it	's	going	to	wind	up	in	a	developing	country	--	often	china	.
i	think	in	our	minds	we	imagine	somebody	's	going	to	take	the	little	bottle	,	say	,	``	oh	,	little	bottle	.	we	're	so	happy	to	see	you	,	little	bottle	.	``
``	you	've	served	so	well	.	``
he	's	given	a	little	bottle	massage	,	a	little	bottle	medal	.
and	say	,	``	what	would	you	like	to	do	next	?	``
the	little	bottle	says	,	``	i	just	do	n't	know	.	``
but	that	's	not	actually	what	happens	.
that	bottle	winds	up	getting	burned	.
recycling	of	plastic	in	many	developing	countries	means	the	incineration	of	the	plastic	,	the	burning	of	the	plastic	,	which	releases	incredible	toxic	chemicals	and	,	once	again	,	kills	people	.
and	so	poor	people	who	are	making	these	products	in	petrochemical	centers	like	``	cancer	alley	,	``	poor	people	who	are	consuming	these	products	disproportionately	,	and	then	poor	people	,	who	even	at	the	tail	end	of	the	recycling	are	having	their	lives	shortened	,	are	all	being	harmed	greatly	by	this	addiction	that	we	have	to	disposability	.
now	you	think	to	yourself	--	because	i	know	how	you	are	--	you	say	,	``	that	sure	is	terrible	for	those	poor	people	.
it	's	just	awful	,	those	poor	people	.
i	hope	someone	does	something	to	help	them	.	``
but	what	we	do	n't	understand	is	--	is	,	here	we	are	in	los	angeles	.
we	worked	very	hard	to	get	the	smog	reduction	happening	here	in	los	angeles	.
but	guess	what	?
because	they	're	doing	so	much	dirty	production	in	asia	now	,	because	the	environmental	laws	do	n't	protect	the	people	in	asia	now	,	almost	all	of	the	clean	air	gains	and	the	toxic	air	gains	that	we	've	achieved	here	in	california	have	been	wiped	out	by	dirty	air	coming	over	from	asia	.
so	,	we	all	are	being	hit	.	we	all	are	being	impacted	.
it	's	just	the	poor	people	get	hit	first	and	worst	.
but	the	dirty	production	,	the	burning	of	toxins	,	the	lack	of	environmental	standards	in	asia	is	actually	creating	so	much	dirty	air	pollution	it	's	coming	across	the	ocean	and	has	erased	our	gains	here	in	california	.
we	're	back	where	we	were	in	the	1970s	.
and	so	we	're	on	one	planet	,	and	we	have	to	be	able	to	get	to	the	root	of	these	problems	.
well	the	root	of	this	problem	,	in	my	view	,	is	the	idea	of	disposability	itself	.
you	see	,	if	you	understand	the	link	between	what	we	're	doing	to	poison	and	pollute	the	planet	and	what	we	're	doing	to	poor	people	,	you	arrive	at	a	very	troubling	,	but	also	very	helpful	,	insight	:	in	order	to	trash	the	planet	,	you	have	to	trash	people	.
but	if	you	create	a	world	where	you	do	n't	trash	people	,	you	ca	n't	trash	the	planet	.
so	now	we	are	at	a	moment	where	the	coming	together	of	social	justice	as	an	idea	and	ecology	as	an	idea	,	we	finally	can	now	see	that	they	are	really	,	at	the	end	of	the	day	,	one	idea	.
and	it	's	the	idea	that	we	do	n't	have	disposable	anything	.
we	do	n't	have	disposable	resources	.
we	do	n't	have	disposable	species	.
and	we	do	n't	have	disposable	people	either	.
we	do	n't	have	a	throwaway	planet	,	and	we	do	n't	have	throwaway	children	--	it	's	all	precious	.
and	as	we	all	begin	to	come	back	to	that	basic	understanding	,	new	opportunities	for	action	begin	to	emerge	.
biomimicry	,	which	is	something	that	is	an	emerging	science	,	winds	up	being	a	very	important	social	justice	idea	.
people	who	are	just	learning	about	this	stuff	,	biomimicry	means	respecting	the	wisdom	of	all	species	.
democracy	,	by	the	way	,	means	respecting	the	wisdom	of	all	people	--	and	we	'll	get	to	that	.
but	biomimicry	means	respecting	the	wisdom	of	all	species	.
it	turns	out	we	're	a	pretty	clever	species	.
this	big	cortex	,	or	whatever	,	we	're	pretty	proud	of	ourselves	.
but	if	we	want	to	make	something	hard	,	we	come	up	,	``	i	know	,	i	'm	going	to	make	a	hard	substance	.
i	know	,	i	'm	going	to	get	vacuums	and	furnaces	and	drag	stuff	out	of	the	ground	and	get	things	hot	and	poison	and	pollute	,	but	i	got	this	hard	thing	.
i	'm	so	clever	,	``
and	you	look	behind	you	,	and	there	's	destruction	all	around	you	.
but	guess	what	?	you	're	so	clever	,	but	you	're	not	as	clever	as	a	clam	.
a	clamshell	's	hard	.
there	's	no	vacuums	.	there	's	no	big	furnaces	.	there	's	no	poison	.	there	's	no	pollution	.
it	turns	out	that	our	other	species	has	figured	out	a	long	time	ago	how	to	create	many	of	the	things	that	we	need	using	biological	processes	that	nature	knows	how	to	use	well	.
well	that	insight	of	biomimicry	,	of	our	scientists	finally	realizing	that	we	have	as	much	to	learn	from	other	species	.	i	do	n't	mean	taking	a	mouse	and	sticking	it	with	stuff	.
i	do	n't	mean	looking	at	it	from	that	way	--	abusing	the	little	species	.	i	mean	actually	respecting	them	,	respecting	what	they	've	achieved	.
that	's	called	biomimicry	,	and	that	opens	the	door	to	zero	waste	production	,	zero	pollution	production	--	that	we	could	actually	enjoy	a	high	quality	of	life	,	a	high	standard	of	living	without	trashing	the	planet	.
well	that	idea	of	biomimicry	,	respecting	the	wisdom	of	all	species	,	combined	with	the	idea	of	democracy	and	social	justice	,	respecting	the	wisdom	and	the	worth	of	all	people	,	would	give	us	a	different	society	.
we	would	have	a	different	economy	.
we	would	have	a	green	society	that	dr.	king	would	be	proud	of	.
that	should	be	the	goal	.
and	the	way	that	we	get	there	is	to	first	of	all	recognize	that	the	idea	of	disposability	not	only	hurts	the	species	we	've	talked	about	,	but	it	even	corrupts	our	own	society	.
we	're	so	proud	to	live	here	in	california	.
we	just	had	this	vote	,	and	everybody	's	like	,	``	well	,	not	in	our	state	.
i	do	n't	know	what	those	other	states	were	doing	.	``
just	so	proud	.
and	,	yeah	,	i	'm	proud	,	too	.
but	california	,	though	we	lead	the	world	in	some	of	the	green	stuff	,	we	also	,	unfortunately	,	lead	the	world	in	some	of	the	gulag	stuff	.
california	has	one	of	the	highest	incarceration	rates	of	all	the	50	states	.
we	have	a	moral	challenge	in	this	moment	.
we	are	passionate	about	rescuing	some	dead	materials	from	the	landfill	,	but	sometimes	not	as	passionate	about	rescuing	living	beings	,	living	people	.
and	i	would	say	that	we	live	in	a	country	--	five	percent	of	the	world	's	population	,	25	percent	of	the	greenhouse	gases	,	but	also	25	percent	of	the	world	's	prisoners	.
one	out	of	every	four	people	locked	up	anywhere	in	the	world	is	locked	up	right	here	in	the	united	states	.
so	that	is	consistent	with	this	idea	that	disposability	is	something	we	believe	in	.
and	yet	,	as	a	movement	that	has	to	broaden	its	constituency	,	that	has	to	grow	,	that	has	to	reach	out	beyond	our	natural	comfort	zone	,	one	of	the	challenges	to	the	success	of	this	movement	,	of	getting	rid	of	things	like	plastic	and	helping	the	economy	shift	,	is	people	look	at	our	movement	with	some	suspicion	.
and	they	ask	a	question	,	and	the	question	is	:	how	can	these	people	be	so	passionate	?
a	poor	person	,	a	low	-	income	person	,	somebody	in	``	cancer	alley	,	``	somebody	in	watts	,	somebody	in	harlem	,	somebody	on	an	indian	reservation	,	might	say	to	themselves	,	and	rightfully	so	,	``	how	can	these	people	be	so	passionate	about	making	sure	that	a	plastic	bottle	has	a	second	chance	in	life	,	or	an	aluminum	can	has	a	second	chance	,	and	yet	,	when	my	child	gets	in	trouble	and	goes	to	prison	,	he	does	n't	get	a	second	chance	?	``
how	can	this	movement	be	so	passionate	about	saying	we	do	n't	have	throwaway	stuff	,	no	throwaway	dead	materials	,	and	yet	accept	throwaway	lives	and	throwaway	communities	like	``	cancer	alley	?	``
and	so	we	now	get	a	chance	to	be	truly	proud	of	this	movement	.
when	we	take	on	topics	like	this	,	it	gives	us	that	extra	call	to	reach	out	to	other	movements	and	to	become	more	inclusive	and	to	grow	,
and	we	can	finally	get	out	of	this	crazy	dilemma	that	we	've	been	in	.
most	of	you	are	good	,	softhearted	people	.
when	you	were	younger	,	you	cared	about	the	whole	world	,	and	at	some	point	somebody	said	you	had	to	pick	an	issue	,	you	had	to	boil	your	love	down	to	an	issue	.
ca	n't	love	the	whole	world	--	you	've	got	to	work	on	trees	,	or	you	've	got	to	work	on	immigration	.
you	've	got	to	shrink	it	down	and	be	about	one	issue	.
and	really	,	they	fundamentally	told	you	,	``	are	you	going	to	hug	a	tree	,	or	are	you	going	to	hug	a	child	?	pick	.
are	you	going	to	hug	a	tree	,	or	are	you	going	to	hug	a	child	?	pick	.	``
well	,	when	you	start	working	on	issues	like	plastic	,	you	realize	that	the	whole	thing	is	connected	,	and	luckily	most	of	us	are	blessed	to	have	two	arms	.
we	can	hug	both	.
thank	you	very	much	.
