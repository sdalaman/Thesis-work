i	was	asked	by	wilsonart	international	,	a	plastic	laminate	company	,	which	is	the	largest	plastic	laminate	company	in	the	world	--	they	asked	me	to	design	a	trade	show	booth	for	exhibition	at	the	international	contemporary	furniture	fair	in	new	york	,	in	2000	.
so	looking	at	their	three	main	markets	for	their	product	which	were	basically	transportation	design	,	interiors	and	furniture	,	we	came	up	with	the	solution	of	taking	an	old	airstream	trailer	and	gutting	it	,	and	trying	to	portray	laminate	,	and	a	trailer	,	in	kind	of	a	fresh	,	new	contemporary	look	.
when	this	trailer	showed	up	at	my	shop	in	berkeley	,	i	'd	actually	never	stepped	foot	in	an	airstream	trailer	,	or	any	other	trailer	.
so	i	can	be	somebody	that	can	look	at	this	in	a	totally	fresh	perspective	and	see	if	i	can	optimize	it	in	its	most	idealistic	fashion	.
i	decided	i	had	to	do	some	research	and	really	figure	out	what	had	gone	wrong	somewhere	along	the	history	of	airstream	.
what	i	discovered	in	these	interiors	is	that	there	was	a	disconnect	between	the	exterior	shell	and	the	interior	architecture	of	the	pieces	.
in	that	the	shell	was	originally	conceived	as	a	lightweight	,	modern	,	futuristic	,	high	-	tech	pod	for	hurtling	down	the	freeway	,	and
the	interiors	were	completely	out	of	sync	with	that	.
in	fact	it	appeared	like	they	referenced	a	mountain	cabin	.
that	seemed	really	like	a	crisis	to	me	,	that	they	had	never	been	able	to	develop	a	vocabulary	about	escape	,	and	about	travel	,	and	modernity	in	this	trailer	that	was	consistent	with	the	shell	.
we	really	needed	to	do	some	archeology	in	the	trailer	itself	to	figure	out	what	's	authentic	in	an	airstream	trailer	,	and	what	feels	like	it	has	true	purpose	and	utility	.
we	stripped	out	all	the	vinyl	and	zolatone	paint	that	was	covering	up	this	just	fantastic	aluminum	shell	.
we	took	off	all	the	visible	hardware	and	trim	that	was	kind	of	doing	the	country	cabin	thing	.
i	literally	drew	on	the	walls	of	the	trailer	,	mocked	it	up	in	cardboard	,	we	'd	come	in	and	cut	,	decide	things	were	wrong	,	pull	it	out	,	put	it	back	in	.
the	main	goal	was	to	smooth	out	the	interior	,	and	begin	to	speak	about	motion	,	and	mobility	,	and	independence	.
the	biggest	difficulty	on	one	of	these	trailers	is	that	when	you	're	designing	there	's	actually	no	logical	place	to	stop	and	start	materials	because	of	the	continuous	form	of	the	trailer	.
there	's	no	such	things	as	two	walls	and	a	ceiling	coming	together	,	where	you	can	change	materials	and	shapes	.
so	that	became	a	challenge	.
compounding	that	,	the	material	of	choice	,	laminate	,	that	i	was	trying	to	highlight	,	only	bends	in	two	dimensions	.
it	's	a	compound	curve	interior	.
what	i	had	to	devise	was	a	way	of	fooling	the	eye	into	believing	that	all	these	panels	are	curved	with	the	shell	.
what	i	came	up	with	was	a	series	of	second	skins	that	basically	float	over	the	aluminum	shell	.
and	what	i	was	trying	to	do	there	was	direct	your	eye	in	the	space	,	so	that	you	would	perceive	the	geometry	in	a	different	way	,	and	that	the	casework	would	n't	break	up	the	space	.
they	also	gave	us	a	way	to	run	power	and	rewire	the	trailer	without	tearing	out	the	skin	,
so	they	function	as	an	electrical	chase	.
that	's	the	trailer	,	pretty	much	finished	.
that	trailer	led	to	another	commission	,	to	participate	in	whats	called	tokyo	designers	block	.
its	a	week	of	furniture	design	events	in	tokyo	,	in	october	.
teruo	kurosaki	,	who	owns	a	furniture	company	called	idee	,	he	asked	me	to	ship	him	two	trailers	to	tokyo	.
he	said	one	he	would	like	to	make	a	real	trailer	,	functioning	,	and	we	would	sell	that	one	.
trailer	number	two	,	you	have	a	blank	slate	,	you	can	to	anything	you	want	.
we	came	up	with	a	fantasy	scenario	of	a	dj	traveling	around	the	states	,	that	would	collect	records	and	go	on	tours	.
this	trailer	housed	two	turntables	,	mixer	,	wet	bar	,	fridge	,	integrated	sound	system	.
it	's	got	a	huge	couch	,	fits	quite	a	few	people	,	and	basically	we	'd	had	a	great	time	with	this	.
and	so	in	this	trailer	i	took	it	upon	myself	to	think	about	travel	,	and	escape	,	in	an	idiosyncratic	sense	.
a	lot	of	these	ideas	migrated	into	the	production	trailers	for	airstream	.
this	brings	us	up	to	the	time	that	i	started	consulting	to	airstream	.
they	came	to	me	and	said	,	``	well	,	what	can	we	do	to	freshen	this	thing	up	?
and	do	you	think	kids	,	you	know	,	skateboarders	,	surfers	,	rock	climbers	,	would	use	these	things	?	``
and	i	said	,	``	well	,	not	in	that	interior	.	``
anyway	,	i	went	out	to	airstream	about	six	times	during	the	process	of	building	this	prototype	,	and	it	's	called	the	bambi	prototype	.
i	thought	,	``	finally	,	oh	yeah	great	,	big	company	,	i	'm	gon	na	work	with	somebody	with	money	for	tooling	and	molding	.	``
and	i	walked	in	their	prototype	facility	,	and	it	's	exactly	like	my	shop	,	only	bigger	--	same	tools	,	same	things	.
so	the	problem	became	--	and	they	set	this	dilemma	to	me	--	that	you	have	to	design	the	interior	using	only	our	existing	technology	,	and	there	's	no	money	for	tooling	or	molding	.
the	trailers	themselves	are	actually	hand	-	built	.
all	the	casework	is	hand	-	scribed	in	,	uniquely	,	so	you	ca	n't	just	cut	100	parts	for	100	trailers	,	you	have	to	cut	them	big	,	and	every	single	one	is	hand	-	fit	.
they	did	n't	want	to	go	to	a	componentized	system	.
and	there	it	is	,	that	's	the	bambi	16	.
