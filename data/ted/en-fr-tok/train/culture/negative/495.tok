i	'm	the	weekly	tech	critic	for	the	new	york	times	.
i	review	gadgets	and	stuff	.
and	mostly	what	good	dads	should	be	doing	this	time	of	year	is	nestling	with	their	kids	and	decorating	the	christmas	tree	.
what	i	'm	mostly	doing	this	year	is	going	on	cable	tv	and	answering	the	same	question	:	``	what	are	the	tech	trends	for	next	year	?	``
and	i	'm	like	,	``	did	n't	we	just	go	through	this	last	year	?	``
but	i	'm	going	to	pick	the	one	that	interests	me	most	,	and	that	is	the	completed	marriage	of	the	cell	phone	and	the	internet	.
you	know	,	i	found	that	volcano	on	google	images	,	not	realizing	how	much	it	makes	me	look	like	the	cover	of	dianetics	.	anyway	,	this	all	started	a	few	years	ago	,	when	they	started	carrying	your	voice	over	the	internet	rather	than	over	a	phone	line	,
and	we	've	come	a	long	way	since	that	.
but	that	was	interesting	in	itself	.	this	is	companies	like	vonage	.
basically	you	take	an	ordinary	telephone	,	you	plug	it	into	this	little	box	that	they	give	you	and	the	box	plugs	into	your	cable	modem	.
now	,	it	works	just	like	a	regular	phone	.
so	you	can	pick	up	the	phone	,	you	hear	a	dial	tone	,	but	its	just	a	fake	-	out	.	it	's	a	wav	file	of	a	dial	tone	,	just	to	reassure	you	that	the	world	has	n't	ended	.
it	could	be	anything	.	it	could	be	salsa	music	or	a	comedy	routine	--	it	does	n't	matter	.
the	little	box	has	your	phone	number	.
so	that	's	really	cool	--	you	can	take	it	to	london	or	siberia	,	and	your	next	door	neighbor	can	dial	your	home	number	and	your	phone	will	ring	,	because	it	's	got	everything	in	the	box	.
they	've	got	every	feature	known	to	man	in	there	,	because	adding	a	new	feature	is	just	software	.
and	as	a	result	of	voice	over	ip	--	i	hate	that	term	--	voice	over	internet	--	land	-	line	home	-	phone	service	has	gone	down	30	percent	in	the	last	three	years	.
i	mean	,	no	self	-	respecting	college	kid	has	home	phone	service	anymore	.
this	is	what	college	kids	are	more	likely	to	have	.	it	's	the	most	popular	voip	service	in	the	world	:	it	's	skype	.
it	's	a	free	program	you	download	for	your	mac	or	pc	,	and	you	make	free	phone	calls	anywhere	in	the	world
the	downside	is	that	you	have	to	wear	a	headset	like	a	nerd	.
it	's	not	your	phone	--	it	's	your	computer	.
but	nonetheless	,	if	you	're	a	college	kid	and	you	have	no	money	,	believe	me	,	this	is	better	than	trying	to	use	your	cellphone	.
it	's	really	cute	seeing	middle	-	aged	people	like	me	,	try	out	skype	for	the	first	time	,	which	is	usually	when	their	kid	goes	away	for	a	semester	abroad	.
they	do	n't	want	to	pay	the	international	fees	,	so	they	're	like	,	``	timmy	!	is	that	you	?	``
it	's	really	cute	.
but	i	--	at	least	it	was	when	i	did	it	--	i	think	where	voip	is	really	going	to	get	interesting	is	when	they	start	putting	it	on	cell	phones	.
imagine	if	you	had	an	ordinary	cell	phone	,	and	any	time	you	were	in	a	wireless	hotspot	--	free	calls	anywhere	in	the	world	,	never	pay	the	cellular	company	a	nickel	.
it	'd	be	really	,	really	cool	--	and	yet	,	even	though	the	technology	for	this	has	been	available	for	five	years	,	incredibly	,	the	number	of	standard	cellphones	offered	by	us	carriers	with	free	voip	is	zero	!
i	ca	n't	figure	out	why	!
actually	,	i	need	to	update	that	.	there	's	one	now	.
and	it	's	so	interesting	that	i	thought	i	would	tell	you	about	it	.
it	comes	from	t	-	mobile	.
and	i	am	not	paid	by	t	-	mobile	.
i	'm	not	plugging	t	-	mobile	.
the	new	york	times	has	very	rigid	policies	about	that	.
ever	since	that	jayson	blair	jerk	ruined	it	for	all	of	us	.
basically	,	the	reason	you	have	n't	heard	about	this	program	is	because	it	was	introduced	last	year	on	june	29	.
does	anyone	remember	what	else	happened	on	june	29	last	year	?
it	was	the	iphone	.	the	iphone	came	out	that	day	.
i	'm	like	,	can	you	imagine	being	the	t	-	mobile	pr	lady	?	you	know	?
``	hi	,	we	have	an	announcement	to	--	wah	!	!	!	``	but	it	's	actually	really	,	really	cool	.	you	have	a	choice	of	phones	,	and	we	're	not	talking	smartphones	--	ordinary	phones	,	including	a	blackberry	,	that	have	wi	-	fi	.
the	deal	is	,	any	time	you	're	in	a	wi	-	fi	hotspot	,	all	your	calls	are	free	.
and	when	you	're	out	of	the	hotspot	,	you	're	on	the	regular	cellular	network	.
you	're	thinking	,	``	well	,	how	often	am	i	in	a	hotspot	?	``
the	answer	is	,	``	all	the	time	!	``
because	they	give	you	a	regular	wireless	router	that	works	with	the	phone	,	for	your	house	.
which	is	really	ingenious	,	because	we	all	know	that	t	-	mobile	is	the	most	pathetic	carrier	.	they	have	coverage	like	the	size	of	my	thumbnail	.
but	it	's	a	hundred	million	dollars	to	put	up	one	of	those	towers	.	right	?
they	do	n't	have	that	kind	of	money	.	instead	they	give	each	of	us	a	seven	-	dollar	-	and	-	95	-	cent	box	.	they	're	like	a	stealth	tower	installation	program	.
we	're	putting	it	in	our	homes	for	them	!
anyway	,	they	have	wi	-	fi	phones	in	europe	.
but	the	thing	that	t	-	mobile	did	that	nobody	's	done	before	is	,	when	you	're	on	a	call	an	you	move	from	wi	-	fi	into	cellular	range	,	the	call	is	handed	off	in	mid	-	syllable	,	seamlessly	.	i	'll	show	you	the	advanced	technologies	we	use	at	the	new	york	times	to	test	this	gear	.
this	is	me	with	a	camcorder	on	a	phone	going	like	this	.
as	i	walk	out	of	the	house	from	my	wi	-	fi	hotspot	into	the	cellular	network	on	a	call	with	my	wife	--
look	at	the	upper	left	.	that	's	the	wi	-	fi	signal	.
:	jennifer	pogue	:	hello	?
david	pogue	:	hi	babes	,	it	's	me	.
jp	:	oh	,	hi	darling	,	how	are	you	?
dp	:	you	're	on	wi	-	fi	.	how	does	it	sound	?
jp	:	oh	,	it	sounds	pretty	good	.
now	,	i	'm	leaving	the	house	.	dp	:	i	'm	going	for	a	walk	--	do	you	mind	?
jp	:	no	not	at	all	.	i	'm	having	a	great	day	with	the	kids	.
dp	:	what	are	you	guys	doing	?
right	there	!
it	just	changed	to	the	cellular	tower	in	mid	-	call	.
i	do	n't	know	why	my	wife	says	i	never	listen	to	her	.	i	do	n't	get	that	.
the	bottom	line	is	that	the	boundaries	,	because	of	the	internet	plus	cellphone	,	are	melting	.
the	cool	thing	about	the	t	-	mobile	phones	is	that	although	switching	technologies	is	very	advanced	,	the	billing	technology	has	not	caught	up	.
so	what	i	mean	is	that	you	can	start	a	call	in	your	house	in	the	wi	-	fi	hotspot	,	you	can	get	in	your	car	and	talk	until	the	battery	's	dead	--	which	would	be	like	10	minutes	--	and	the	call	will	continue	to	be	free	.
because	they	do	n't	,	they	have	n't	--	well	,	no	,	wait	!	not	so	fast	.
it	also	works	the	other	way	.
so	if	you	start	a	call	on	your	cellular	network	and	you	come	home	,	you	keep	being	billed	.
which	is	why	most	people	with	this	service	get	into	the	habit	of	saying	,	``	hey	,	i	just	got	home	.	can	i	call	you	right	back	?	``
now	you	get	it	.
it	's	also	true	that	if	you	use	one	of	these	phones	overseas	,	it	does	n't	know	what	internet	hotspot	you	're	in	.
on	the	internet	nobody	knows	you	're	a	dog	,
right	?	nobody	knows	you	're	in	pakistan	.
you	can	make	free	unlimited	calls	home	to	the	us	with	these	phones	.	so	,	very	,	very	interesting	.
this	is	another	favorite	of	mine	.
does	anyone	here	have	a	working	cellphone	that	's	on	,	with	coverage	,	who	can	make	a	call	right	now	without	a	lot	of	fussing	?
ok	.	would	you	call	me	please	right	now	?	[	phone	number	given	.	]
and	do	n't	you	all	call	me	at	three	a.m.	asking	me	to	fix	your	printer	.
i	have	two	cellphones	,	so	this	going	to	be	very	odd	,	if	it	works	.
i	should	know	not	to	do	technology	demos	in	front	of	an	audience	.	it	's	just	,	like	,	absurd	.
this	one	is	going	off	.	and	--	oh	,	i	have	the	ringer	off	.	tsh	!	great	.
anyway	,	this	one	is	also	going	off	.	so	they	're	both	ringing	at	the	same	time	.
excuse	me	one	second	.
hello	?
oh	.	where	are	you	calling	from	?
no	,	no	just	kidding	.	there	he	is	.	thank	you	very	much	for	doing	that	.
i	did	n't	even	know	it	was	you	--	i	was	looking	at	this	guy	.
oh	great	!	yeah	.	yeah	you	can	all	stop	calling	now	!
all	right	!	we	've	made	the	point	.
all	right	.	ringer	off	.	everyone	wants	in	on	the	action	.
so	this	is	grand	central	at	work	--	it	's	a	--	oh	,	for	gods	sake	!	i	have	your	numbers	now	!
you	will	pay	.
grand	central	is	this	really	brilliant	idea	where	they	give	you	a	new	phone	number	,	and	then	at	that	point	one	phone	number	rings	all	your	phones	at	once	.
your	home	phone	,	your	work	phone	,	your	cellphone	,	your	yacht	phone
.
the	beauty	of	that	is	you	never	miss	a	call	.
i	know	a	lot	of	you	are	like	,	``	ooh	,	i	do	n't	want	to	be	reached	at	any	hour	.	``
but	the	beauty	is	it	's	all	going	through	the	internet	,
so	you	get	all	of	these	really	cool	features	--	like	you	can	say	,	i	want	these	people	to	be	able	to	call	me	only	during	these	hours	.	and	i	want	these	people	to	hear	this	greeting	,	``	hi	boss	,	i	'm	out	making	us	both	some	money	.	leave	a	message	.	``
and	then	your	wife	calls	,	and	,	``	hi	honey	,	leave	me	a	message	.	``
very	,	very	customizable	.
google	bought	it	,	and	they	've	been	working	on	it	for	a	year	.
they	're	supposed	to	come	out	with	it	very	shortly	in	a	public	method	.
by	the	way	,	this	is	something	that	really	bothers	me	.
i	do	n't	know	if	you	realize	this	.	when	you	call	411	on	your	cellphone	,	they	charge	you	two	bucks	.
did	you	know	that	?	it	's	an	outrage	.
i	actually	got	a	photograph	of	the	verizon	employee	right	there	.
i	'm	going	to	tell	you	how	to	avoid	that	now	.
what	you	're	going	to	use	is	google	cellular	.
it	's	totally	free	--	there	's	not	even	ads	.
if	you	know	how	to	send	a	text	message	,	you	can	get	the	same	information	for	free	.
i	'm	about	to	change	your	life	.	so	here	's	me	doing	it	.
you	send	a	text	message	to	the	word	``	google	,	``	which	turns	out	to	be	46645	.	leave	off	the	last	``	e	``	for	savings	.
anyway	,	so	lets	say	you	need	a	drugstore	near	chicago	.
you	type	``	pharmacy	chicago	,	``	or	the	zip	code	.
you	hit	send	,	and	in	five	seconds	,	they	will	send	you	back	the	two	closest	drugstores	,	complete	with	name	address	and	phone	number	.
here	it	comes	.
and	it	's	already	written	down	--	so	,	like	,	if	you	're	driving	,	you	do	n't	have	to	do	one	of	these	things	,	``	uh	huh	,	uh	huh	,	uh	huh	.	``
it	works	with	weather	,	too	.
you	can	say	``	weather	,	``	and	the	name	of	the	city	you	're	going	to	travel	to	.
and	then	in	five	seconds	,	they	send	you	back	the	complete	weather	forecast	for	that	town	.
shortly	i	'll	tell	you	why	i	was	in	milan	.
here	we	go	.	and	those	are	just	the	beginning	.
these	are	all	the	different	things	that	you	can	text	to	google	and	they	will	--
yeah	!	you	're	all	trying	to	write	this	down	.
that	's	cute	.	i	do	have	an	email	address	.	you	can	just	ask	me	.
it	's	absolutely	phenomenal	.	the	only	downside	is	that	it	requires	you	to	know	how	to	text	--
send	a	text	message	.	nobody	over	40	knows	how	to	do	that	.
so	i	'm	going	to	teach	you	something	even	better	.
this	is	called	google	info	.
they	've	just	launched	this	voice	-	activated	version	of	the	same	thing	.
it	's	speech	recognition	like	you	've	never	heard	before	.
so	lets	say	i	'm	in	monterey	,
and	i	want	what	?
i	want	to	find	what	?	bagels	.	ok	.
google	:	say	the	business	and	the	city	and	state	.
dp	:	bagels	,	monterey	,	california	.
i	got	the	chinese	line	.
google	:	bagels	,	monterey	,	california	.
top	eight	results	:	number	one	,
bagel	bakery	on	el	dorado	street	.
to	select	number	one	,	you	can	press	one	or	say	``	number	one	.	``
number	two	:	bagel	bakery	,	commissary	department	.
number	two	.	number	two	.	two	.
why	do	i	listen	to	people	in	the	audience	?
well	anyway	--	oh	!	here	we	go	!
google	:	...	commissary	department	on	mcclellan	avenue	,	monterey	.
i	'll	connect	you	,	or	say	``	details	,	``	or	``	go	back	.	``
dp	:	he	's	connecting	me	!	he	does	n't	even	tell	me	the	phone	number	.
he	's	just	connecting	me	directly	.	it	's	like	having	a	personal	valet	.
google	:	hold	on	.
dp	:	hi	,	could	i	have	400	with	a	schmear	?
no	,	no	,	no	--	just	kidding	,	no	no	.
so	anyway	,	you	never	even	find	out	the	number	.
it	's	just	so	amazing	.
and	it	has	incredible	,	incredible	accuracy	.
this	is	even	more	amazing	.	put	this	in	your	speed	dial	.
this	you	can	ask	by	voice	any	question	.
who	won	the	1958	world	series	?
what	's	the	recipe	for	a	certain	cocktail	?
it	's	absolutely	amazing	--	and	they	text	you	back	the	answer	.
i	tried	this	this	morning	just	to	make	sure	it	's	still	alive	.
``	which	actors	have	played	james	bond	?	``
they	text	me	back	this	:	``	sean	connery	,	george	lazenby	,	roger	moore	,	timothy	dalton	,	pierce	brosnan	,	daniel	craig	.	``
right	!	and	then	i	was	trying	to	pretend	i	was	like	a	valley	girl	.	i	'm	like	,	``	what	's	the	word	that	means	you	know	,	like	,	when	the	sun	,	the	moon	and	the	earth	are	,	like	,	all	in	a	line	?	``
just	to	see	how	the	recognition	was	.
they	texted	me	back	,	``	it	's	called	a	syzygy	.	``
which	i	knew	,	because	it	's	the	word	that	won	me	the	ohio	spelling	bee	in	1976	.
you	know	,	there	's	a	lot	of	people	wondering	,	``	how	on	earth	are	they	going	to	make	money	doing	this	?	``	and	the	answer	is	:	look	at	the	last	line	.
they	put	this	teeny	-	weeny	little	ad	,	about	10	characters	long	.
and	a	lot	of	people	also	want	to	know	,	``	how	does	it	work	?
how	can	it	be	so	good	?	it	's	as	though	there	is	a	human	being	on	the	other	end	of	the	line	.	``
because	there	is	one	!
they	have	10,000	people	who	are	being	paid	20	cents	per	answer	.
as	you	can	imagine	,	it	's	college	kids	and	old	people	.
that	's	who	can	afford	to	do	that	.
but	it	's	a	human	being	on	the	line	.	and	it	's	gotten	me	out	of	so	many	tough	positions	like	,	``	when	's	the	last	flight	out	of	chicago	?	``
you	know	.	it	's	just	absolutely	amazing	.
another	thing	that	really	bothers	me	about	cell	phones	today	--	this	is	probably	my	biggest	pet	peeve	in	all	of	technology	.	when	i	call	to	leave	you	a	message	,	i	get	15	seconds	of	instructions	from	a	third	-	grade	teacher	on	ambien	!
``	to	page	this	person	...	``
page	?	what	is	this	,	1975	?
nobody	has	pagers	anymore	.
``	you	may	begin	speaking	at	the	tone	.
when	you	have	finished	recording	,	you	may	hang	up	.	``	no	!
and	then	it	gets	worse	:	when	i	call	to	retrieve	my	messages	,	first	of	all	:	``	you	have	87	messages	.
to	listen	to	your	messages	...	``
why	else	am	i	calling	?
of	course	i	want	to	listen	to	the	messages	!
oh	!	you	all	have	cell	phones	too	.
so	last	year	i	went	to	milan	,	italy	,
and	i	got	to	speak	to	an	audience	of	cellular	executives	from	200	countries	around	the	world	.
and	i	said	as	a	joke	--	as	a	joke	,	i	said	,	``	i	did	the	math	.	verizon	has	70	million	customers	.
if	you	check	your	voicemail	twice	a	day	,	that	's	100	million	dollars	a	year	.
i	bet	you	guys	are	doing	this	just	to	run	up	our	airtime	,	are	n't	you	?	``
no	chuckle	.	they	're	like	this	--
where	is	the	outrage	,	people	?	rise	up	!
sorry	.	i	'm	not	bitter	.
so	now	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	how	to	get	out	of	that	.
there	are	these	services	that	transcribe	your	voicemail	into	text	.	and	they	send	it	either	to	your	email	or	as	text	messages	to	your	phone	.
it	is	a	life	-	changer	.
and	by	the	way	,	they	do	n't	always	get	the	words	right	,	because	it	's	over	the	phone	and	all	that	.
so	they	attach	the	audio	file	at	the	bottom	of	the	email	so	you	can	listen	to	double	-	check	.
the	services	are	called	things	like	spinvox	,	phonetag	--	this	is	the	one	i	use	--	callwave	.	a	lot	of	people	say	,	``	how	are	they	doing	this	?
i	do	n't	really	want	people	listening	in	to	my	calls	.	``
the	executives	at	these	companies	told	me	,	``	well	we	use	a	proprietary	b	-	to	-	b	,	best	-	of	-	breed	,	peer	-	to	-	peer	soluti	--	``	you	know	.
i	think	basically	it	's	like	these	guys	in	india	with	headsets	,	you	know	,	listening	in	.
the	reason	i	think	that	is	that
on	the	first	day	i	tried	one	of	these	services	,	i	got	two	voicemail	messages	.	one	was	from	a	guy	named	michael	stevenson	,	which	should	n't	be	that	hard	to	transcribe	,	and	it	was	misspelled	.
the	other	was	from	my	video	producer	at	the	times	,	whose	name	is	vijaiy	singh	,	with	the	silent	'	h	'	.	nailed	that	one	.
so	you	be	the	judge	.
anyway	,	this	service	,	callwave	,	promises	that	it	's	all	software	--	nobody	is	listening	to	your	messages	.
and	they	also	promise	that	they	're	going	to	transcribe	only	the	gist	of	your	messages	.
so	i	thought	i	'd	see	how	that	goes	.
this	is	me	testing	it	out	.
:	hello	,	this	is	michael	.
hope	you	're	doing	well	.	i	'm	fine	here	.	everything	's	good	.
hey	,	i	was	walking	along	the	street	and	the	sky	was	blue	.
and	your	daughter	broke	her	leg	at	soccer	practice	.
i	'm	going	to	have	a	sandwich	for	lunch	.
she	's	in	room	--	emergency	room	53w	.
ok	,	talk	to	you	later	--	bye	.
i	love	my	job	.
so	a	couple	minutes	later	,	this	i	got	by	email	.
it	's	a	very	good	transcription	.	but	a	couple	minutes	after	that	,	i	got	the	text	message	version	.	now	remember	,	a	text	message	can	only	be	160	characters	long	.
so	it	had	better	be	the	gist	of	the	gist	,	right	?
i	'm	not	kidding	you	.	the	message	said	,	``	was	walking	along	the	street	``	and	``	sky	was	blue	``	and	``	emergency	``	!
what	the	f	--	?
well	i	guess	that	was	the	gist	.
and	lastly	,	i	just	have	to	talk	about	this	one	.
this	is	my	favorite	of	all	time	.	it	's	called	popularitydialer.com	.
basically	,	you	're	going	to	go	on	some	iffy	date	,	or	a	potentially	bad	meeting	.
so	you	go	and	you	type	in	your	phone	number	,	and	at	the	exact	minute	where	you	want	to	be	called	--
and	at	that	moment	your	phone	will	ring	.
and	you	're	like	,	``	i	'm	sorry	.	i	've	got	to	take	this	.	``
the	really	beautiful	thing	is	,	you	know	how	when	somebody	's	sitting	next	to	you	,	sometimes	they	can	sort	of	hear	a	little	bit	of	the	caller	.
so	they	give	you	a	choice	of	what	you	want	to	hear	on	the	other	end	.
here	's	the	girlfriend	.
phone	:	hey	you	,	what	's	going	on	?
dp	:	i	'm	kinda	,	like	,	giving	a	talk	right	now	.
phone	:	well	,	that	's	good	.
dp	:	what	are	you	doing	?
phone	:	i	was	just	wondering	what	you	were	up	to	.
dp	:	right	,	i	ca	n't	really	talk	right	now	.
this	is	the	--	i	love	this	--	the	boss	call	.
phone	:	hey	,	this	is	mr.	johnson	calling	from	the	office	.
dp	:	oh	,	hi	,	sir	.
phone	:	did	you	complete	that	thing	about	a	month	ago	?	that	photocopier	training	?
dp	:	oh	--	sorry	i	forgot	.
phone	:	yeah	,	well	so	when	was	the	last	time	you	used	the	photocopier	?
dp	:	it	was	like	three	weeks	ago	.
phone	:	well	,	i	do	n't	know	if	you	heard	,	you	might	have	heard	from	lenny	,	but	--	i	think	the	biggest	change	when	internet	met	phone	was	with	the	iphone	.
not	my	finest	moment	in	new	york	times	journalism	.
it	was	when	in	the	fall	of	2006	,	i	explained	why	apple	would	never	do	a	cellphone	.
i	looked	like	a	moron	.	however	,	my	logic	was	good	,
because	--	i	do	n't	know	if	you	realize	this	,	but	--	until	the	iphone	came	along	,	the	carriers	--	verizon	,	at	&	t	,	cingular	--	held	veto	power	over	every	aspect	of	every	design	of	every	phone	.
i	know	the	people	who	worked	on	the	treo	.
they	went	around	to	these	carriers	and	said	,	``	look	at	these	cool	features	.	``	and	verizon	is	like	,	``	hmm	,	no	.
i	do	n't	think	so	.	``
it	was	not	very	conducive	to	innovation	.
what	i	did	n't	anticipate	was	that	steve	jobs	went	around	and	said	,	``	tell	you	what	--	i	'll	give	you	a	five	-	year	exclusive	if	you	'll	let	me	design	this	phone	in	peace	--	and	you	wo	n't	even	see	it	till	it	's	done	.	``
actually	,	even	so	,	he	was	turned	down	by	verizon	and	others	.
finally	cingular	said	ok	.
i	'm	going	to	talk	about	the	effect	of	the	iphone	.
please	do	n't	corner	me	at	the	party	tonight	and	go	,	``	what	are	you	?	an	apple	fan	boy	?	``
-	you	know	.	i	'm	not	.
you	can	see	what	i	said	about	it	.	it	's	a	flawed	masterpiece	.
it	's	got	bad	things	and	good	things	.	lets	all	acknowledge	that	right	now	.
but	it	did	change	a	few	things	.	the	first	thing	it	changed
was	that	all	those	carriers	saw	that	they	sold	10	million	of	these	things	in	a	year	.	and	they	said	,	``	oh	my	gosh	,	maybe	we	've	been	doing	it	wrong	.
maybe	we	should	let	phone	designers	design	the	phones	.	``
another	thing	was	that	it	let	10	million	people	,	for	the	first	time	,	experience	being	online	all	the	time	.
not	using	these	60	-	dollar	-	a	-	month	cellular	cards	for	their	laptops	.
i	do	n't	understand	why	we	're	not	there	yet	.
when	i	'm	an	old	man	,	i	'm	going	to	tell	my	grandchildren	,	``	when	i	was	your	age	,	if	i	wanted	to	check	my	email	,	i	used	to	drive	around	town	looking	for	a	coffee	shop	.	i	did	!	``
``	we	had	wireless	base	stations	that	could	broadcast	--	yay	,	about	150	feet	across	.	``
it	's	absurd	.	we	have	power	outlets	in	every	room	of	every	building	.	we	have	running	water	.
what	's	the	problem	?
anyway	--	but	this	teaches	people	what	it	's	like	.
you	have	to	go	to	youtube	and	type	in	``	iphone	shuffle	.	``
this	guy	did	a	mock	video	of	one	that	's	one	inch	square	,	like	the	real	ipod	shuffle	.
it	's	like	,	``	it	only	has	one	button	.
touch	it	and	it	dials	a	number	at	random	.	``
``	who	the	hell	is	this	?	``
but	the	other	thing	it	did	is	it	opened	up	this	idea	of	an	app	store	.
it	downloads	right	to	the	phone	.
and	you	can	use	the	tilt	sensor	to	steer	this	car	using	this	game	.
these	programs	can	use	all	the	components	of	the	iphone	--	the	touch	screen	.
this	is	the	etch	-	a	-	sketch	program	--	the	theme	of	eg	2008	.
you	know	how	you	erase	it	?
of	course	.	you	shake	it	.
right	,	of	course	.	we	shake	it	to	erase	,	like	this	.
they	have	10,000	of	these	programs	.
this	is	the	translator	program	.	they	have	every	language	in	the	world	.
you	type	in	what	you	want	,	and	it	gives	you	the	translation	.
this	is	amazing	.	this	is	midomi	.
a	song	is	running	through	your	head	--
you	sing	it	into	the	thing	:	do	do	do	do	do	,	da	da	da	da	da	da	,	da	dum	...
ok	,	you	tap	,	``	done	``	and	it	will	find	out	the	song	and	play	it	for	you	.
i	know	.	it	's	insane	,	right	?
this	is	pandora	.	free	internet	radio	.	not	just	free	internet	radio	--
you	type	in	a	band	or	a	song	name	.
it	will	immediately	play	you	that	song	or	that	band	.
it	has	a	thumbs	-	up	and	a	thumbs	-	down	.	you	say	if	you	like	this	song	or	not	.
if	you	like	it	,	it	tries	another	song	on	you	from	a	different	band	,	with	the	same	instrumentation	,	vocals	,	theme	and	tempo	.
if	you	like	that	one	,	or	do	n't	like	it	,	you	do	thumbs	-	up	and	thumbs	-	down	.	over	time	it	tailors	the	songs	so	that	it	completely	stops	playing	bad	songs	.	it	eventually	only	plays	songs	you	like	.
this	is	urbanspoon	.	you	're	in	a	city	.	it	knows	from	gps	where	you	're	standing	.
you	want	to	find	a	place	to	eat	.	you	shake	it	.
it	proposes	a	restaurant	.
it	gives	you	the	price	,	and	the	location	and	ratings	.
video	:	i	'm	not	going	all	the	way	to	flushing	.
anyway	,	just	amazing	,	amazing	things	.
of	course	,	its	not	just	about	the	iphone	.
the	iphone	broke	the	dyke	,	the	wall	.
but	now	it	's	everybody	else	.	so	google	has	done	their	own	android	operating	system	that	will	soon	be	on	handsets	--	phones	from	34	companies	.
touch	screen	--	very	,	very	nice	.
also	with	its	own	app	store	,	where	you	can	download	programs	.	this	is	amazing	.	in	the	wake	of	all	this	,	verizon	,	the	most	calcified	,	corporate	,	conservative	carrier	of	all	,	said	,	``	you	can	use	any	phone	you	want	on	our	network	.	``
i	love	the	wired	headline	:	pigs	fly	,	hell	freezes	over	and	verizon	opens	up	its	network	--	no	.	really	.
so	everything	is	changing	.	we	've	entered	a	new	world	of	innovation	,	where	the	cell	phone	becomes	your	laptop	,	customized	the	way	you	want	it	.
every	cell	phone	is	unique	.	there	is	software	that	you	can	add	on	.
can	i	do	one	more	one	-	minute	song	?	thank	you	.
just	to	round	it	up	--	this	is	the	new	apple	power	music	stand	.
it	's	only	three	pounds	,	or	12	if	you	install	microsoft	office	.	sorry	,	that	was	mean	.
this	is	a	song	i	did	for	the	new	york	times	website	as	a	music	video	.
ladies	and	gentlemen	,	for	seven	blissful	hours	it	was	the	number	one	video	on	youtube	.
and	now	the	end	is	near	.	i	'm	sick	to	death	of	this	old	cell	phone	.	bad	sound	,	the	signal	's	weak	,	the	software	stinks	.
a	made	-	in	-	hell	phone	.
i	've	heard	there	's	something	new	--	a	million	times	more	rad	than	my	phone	.
i	too	will	join	the	cult	.
i	want	an	iphone	.
concerns	--	i	have	a	few	.	it	's	got	some	flaws	;	we	may	just	face	it	.
no	keys	,	no	memory	card	,	the	battery	's	sealed	--	you	ca	n't	replace	it	.
but	god	,	this	thing	is	sweet	.
a	multitouch	,	ipod	,	wi	-	fi	phone	.
you	had	me	from	,	``	hello	.	``
i	want	an	iphone	.
i	want	to	touch	its	precious	screen	.
i	want	to	wipe	the	smudges	clean	.
i	want	my	friends	to	look	and	drool	.
i	want	to	say	,	``	look	--	now	i	'm	cool	``
i	stood	in	line	and	i	'll	get	mine	.
i	want	an	iphone	.
for	what	is	a	man	?
what	has	he	got	?	if	not	iphone	,	then	he	's	got	squat	.
it	's	all	the	things	a	phone	should	be	.
who	cares	if	it	's	at	&	t	?
i	took	a	stand	,	paid	half	a	grand	!
and	i	got	an	iphone	!
thank	you	.	thank	you	very	much	.
