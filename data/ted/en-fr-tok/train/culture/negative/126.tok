i	'd	like	to	start	tonight	by	something	completely	different	,	asking	you	to	join	me	by	stepping	off	the	land	and	jumping	into	the	open	ocean	for	a	moment	.
90	percent	of	the	living	space	on	the	planet	is	in	the	open	ocean	,	and	it	's	where	life	--	the	title	of	our	seminar	tonight	--	it	's	where	life	began	.
and	it	's	a	lively	and	a	lovely	place	,	but	we	're	rapidly	changing	the	oceans	with	our	--	not	only	with	our	overfishing	,	our	irresponsible	fishing	,	our	adding	of	pollutants	like	fertilizer	from	our	cropland	,
but	also	,	most	recently	,	with	climate	change	,	and	steve	schneider	,	i	'm	sure	,	will	be	going	into	greater	detail	on	this	.
now	,	as	we	continue	to	tinker	with	the	oceans	,	more	and	more	reports	are	predicting	that	the	kinds	of	seas	that	we	're	creating	will	be	conducive	to	low	-	energy	type	of	animals	,	like	jellyfish	and	bacteria	.
and	this	might	be	the	kind	of	seas	we	're	headed	for	.
now	jellyfish	are	strangely	hypnotic	and	beautiful	,	and	you	'll	see	lots	of	gorgeous	ones	at	the	aquarium	on	friday	,	but	they	sting	like	hell	,	and	jellyfish	sushi	and	sashimi	is	just	not	going	to	fill	you	up	.
about	100	grams	of	jellyfish	equals	four	calories	.
so	it	may	be	good	for	the	waistline	,	but	it	probably	wo	n't	keep	you	satiated	for	very	long	.
and	a	sea	that	's	just	filled	and	teeming	with	jellyfish	is	n't	very	good	for	all	the	other	creatures	that	live	in	the	oceans	,	that	is	,	unless	you	eat	jellyfish	.
and	this	is	this	voracious	predator	launching	a	sneak	attack	on	this	poor	little	unsuspecting	jellyfish	there	,	a	by	-	the	-	wind	sailor	.
and	that	predator	is	the	giant	ocean	sunfish	,	the	mola	mola	,	whose	primary	prey	are	jellyfish	.
this	animal	is	in	``	the	guinness	world	book	of	records	``	for	being	the	world	's	heaviest	bony	fish	.
it	reaches	up	to	almost	5,000	pounds	--	on	a	diet	of	jellyfish	,	primarily	.
and	i	think	it	's	kind	of	a	nice	little	cosmological	convergence	here	that	the	mola	mola	--	its	common	name	is	sunfish	--	that	its	favorite	food	is	the	moon	jelly	.
so	it	's	kind	of	nice	,	the	sun	and	the	moon	getting	together	this	way	,	even	if	one	is	eating	the	other	.
now	this	is	typically	how	you	see	sunfish	,	this	is	where	they	get	their	common	name	.
they	like	to	sunbathe	,	ca	n't	blame	them	.
they	just	lay	out	on	the	surface	of	the	sea	and	most	people	think	they	're	sick	or	lazy	,	but	that	's	a	typical	behavior	,
they	lie	out	and	bask	on	the	surface	.
their	other	name	,	mola	mola	,	is	--	it	sounds	hawaiian	,	but	it	's	actually	latin	for	millstone	,	and	that	's	attributable	to	their	roundish	,	very	bizarre	,	cut	-	off	shape	.
it	's	as	if	,	as	they	were	growing	,	they	just	forgot	the	tail	part	.	and	that	's	actually	what	drew	me	to	the	mola	in	the	first	place	,	was	this	terribly	bizarre	shape	.
you	know	,	you	look	at	sharks	,	and	they	're	streamlined	,	and	they	're	sleek	,	and	you	look	at	tuna	,	and	they	're	like	torpedoes	--	they	just	give	away	their	agenda	.	they	're	about	migration	and	strength	,	and	then	you	look	at	the	sunfish	.
and	this	is	just	so	elegantly	mysterious	,	it	's	just	--	it	really	kind	of	holds	its	cards	a	lot	tighter	than	say	,	a	tuna	.
so	i	was	just	intrigued	with	what	--	you	know	,	what	is	this	animal	's	story	?
well	,	as	with	anything	in	biology	,	nothing	really	makes	sense	except	in	the	light	of	evolution	.
the	mola	's	no	exception	.
they	appeared	shortly	after	the	dinosaurs	disappeared	,	65	million	years	ago	,	at	a	time	when	whales	still	had	legs	,	and	they	come	from	a	rebellious	little	puffer	fish	faction	--	oblige	me	a	little	kipling	-	esque	storytelling	here	.
of	course	evolution	is	somewhat	random	,	and	you	know	,	about	55	million	years	ago	there	was	this	rebellious	little	puffer	fish	faction	that	said	,	oh	,	the	heck	with	the	coral	reefs	--	we	're	going	to	head	to	the	high	seas	.
and	lots	of	generations	,	lots	of	tweaking	and	torquing	,	and	we	turn	our	puffer	into	the	mola	.
you	know	,	if	you	give	mother	nature	enough	time	,	that	is	what	she	will	produce	.
they	look	--	maybe	they	look	kind	of	prehistoric	and	unfinished	,	abridged	perhaps	,	but	in	fact	,	in	fact	they	are	the	--	they	vie	for	the	top	position	of	the	most	evolutionarily	-	derived	fish	in	the	sea	,	right	up	there	with	flat	fish	.
they	're	--	every	single	thing	about	that	fish	has	been	changed	.
and	in	terms	of	fishes	--	fishes	appeared	500	million	years	ago	,	and	they	're	pretty	modern	,	just	50	million	years	ago	,	so	--	so	interestingly	,	they	give	away	their	ancestry	as	they	develop	.
they	start	as	little	eggs	,	and	they	're	in	``	the	guinness	world	book	of	records	``	again	for	having	the	most	number	of	eggs	of	any	vertebrate	on	the	planet	.
a	single	four	-	foot	female	had	300	million	eggs	,	can	carry	300	million	eggs	in	her	ovaries	--	imagine	--	and	they	get	to	be	over	10	feet	long	.	imagine	what	a	10	foot	one	has	.
and	from	that	little	egg	,	they	pass	through	this	spiky	little	porcupine	fish	stage	,	reminiscent	of	their	ancestry	,	and	develop	--	this	is	their	little	adolescent	stage	.
they	school	as	adolescents	,	and	become	behemoth	loners	as	adults	.
that	's	a	little	diver	up	there	in	the	corner	.
they	're	in	``	the	guinness	world	book	of	records	``	again	for	being	the	vertebrate	growth	champion	of	the	world	.
from	their	little	hatching	size	of	their	egg	,	into	their	little	larval	stage	till	they	reach	adulthood	,	they	put	on	600	million	times	an	increase	in	weight	.
600	million	.	now	imagine	if	you	gave	birth	to	a	little	baby	,	and	you	had	to	feed	this	thing	.
that	would	mean	that	your	child	,	you	would	expect	it	to	gain	the	weight	of	six	titanics	.
now	i	do	n't	know	how	you	'd	feed	a	child	like	that	but	--
we	do	n't	know	how	fast	the	molas	grow	in	the	wild	,	but	captive	growth	studies	at	the	monterey	bay	aquarium	--	one	of	the	first	places	to	have	them	in	captivity	--	they	had	one	that	gained	800	lbs	in	14	months	.
i	said	,	now	,	that	's	a	true	american	.
so	being	a	loner	is	a	great	thing	,	especially	in	today	's	seas	,	because	schooling	used	to	be	salvation	for	fishes	,	but	it	's	suicide	for	fishes	now	.
but	unfortunately	molas	,	even	though	they	do	n't	school	,	they	still	get	caught	in	nets	as	by	-	catch	.
if	we	're	going	to	save	the	world	from	total	jellyfish	domination	,	then	we	've	got	to	figure	out	what	the	jellyfish	predators	--	how	they	live	their	lives	,	like	the	mola	.
and	unfortunately	,	they	make	up	a	large	portion	of	the	california	by	-	catch	--	up	to	26	percent	of	the	drift	net	.
and	in	the	mediterranean	,	in	the	swordfish	net	fisheries	,	they	make	up	up	to	90	percent	.
so	we	've	got	to	figure	out	how	they	're	living	their	lives	.
and	how	do	you	do	that	?
how	do	you	do	that	with	an	animal	--	very	few	places	in	the	world	.
this	is	an	open	ocean	creature	.	it	knows	no	boundaries	--	it	does	n't	go	to	land	.
how	do	you	get	insight	?
how	do	you	seduce	an	open	ocean	creature	like	that	to	spill	its	secrets	?
well	,	there	's	some	great	new	technology	that	has	just	recently	become	available	,	and	it	's	just	a	boon	for	getting	insight	into	open	ocean	animals	.
and	it	's	pictured	right	here	,	that	little	tag	up	there	.
that	little	tag	can	record	temperature	,	depth	and	light	intensity	,	which	is	correlated	with	time	,	and	from	that	we	can	get	locations	.
and	it	can	record	this	data	for	up	to	two	years	,	and	keep	it	in	that	tag	,	release	at	a	pre	-	programmed	time	,	float	to	the	surface	,	upload	all	that	data	,	that	whole	travelogue	,	to	satellite	,	which	relays	it	directly	to	our	computers	,	and	we	've	got	that	whole	dataset	.	and	we	did	n't	even	have	--	we	just	had	to	tag	the	animal	and	then	we	went	home	and	you	know	,	sat	at	our	desks	.
so	the	great	thing	about	the	mola	is	that	when	we	put	the	tag	on	them	--	if	you	look	up	here	--	that	's	streaming	off	,	that	's	right	where	we	put	the	tag	.
and	it	just	so	happens	that	's	a	parasite	hanging	off	the	mola	.
molas	are	infamous	for	carrying	tons	of	parasites	.
they	're	just	parasite	hotels	;	even	their	parasites	have	parasites	.
i	think	donne	wrote	a	poem	about	that	.
but	they	have	40	genera	of	parasites	,	and	so	we	figured	just	one	more	parasite	wo	n't	be	too	much	of	a	problem	.
and	they	happen	to	be	a	very	good	vehicle	for	carrying	oceanographic	equipment	.
they	do	n't	seem	to	mind	,	so	far	.
so	what	are	we	trying	to	find	out	?	we	're	focusing	on	the	pacific	.
we	're	tagging	on	the	california	coast	,	and	we	're	tagging	over	in	taiwan	and	japan	.
and	we	're	interested	in	how	these	animals	are	using	the	currents	,	using	temperature	,	using	the	open	ocean	,	to	live	their	lives	.
we	'd	love	to	tag	in	monterey	.
monterey	is	one	of	the	few	places	in	the	world	where	molas	come	in	large	numbers	.
not	this	time	of	year	--	it	's	more	around	october	.
and	we	'd	love	to	tag	here	--	this	is	an	aerial	shot	of	monterey	--	but	unfortunately	,	the	molas	here	end	up	looking	like	this
because	another	one	of	our	locals	really	likes	molas	but	in	the	wrong	way	.
the	california	sea	lion	takes	the	molas	as	soon	as	they	come	into	the	bay	,	rips	off	their	fins	,	fashions	them	into	the	ultimate	frisbee	,	mola	style	,	and	then	tosses	them	back	and	forth	.
and	i	'm	not	exaggerating	,	it	is	just	--	and	sometimes	they	do	n't	eat	them	,	it	's	just	spiteful	.
and	you	know	,	the	locals	think	it	's	terrible	behavior	,	it	's	just	horrible	watching	this	happen	,	day	after	day	.
the	poor	little	molas	coming	in	,	getting	ripped	to	shreds	,
so	we	head	down	south	,	to	san	diego	.
not	so	many	california	sea	lions	down	there	.
and	the	molas	there	,	you	can	find	them	with	a	spotter	plane	very	easily	,	and	they	like	to	hang	out	under	floating	rafts	of	kelp	.
and	under	those	kelps	--	this	is	why	the	molas	come	there	because	it	's	spa	time	for	the	molas	there	.
as	soon	as	they	get	under	those	rafts	of	kelp	,	the	exfoliating	cleaner	fish	come	.
and	they	come	and	give	the	molas	--	you	can	see	they	strike	this	funny	little	position	that	says	,	``	i	'm	not	threatening	,	but	i	need	a	massage	.	``
and	they	'll	put	their	fins	out	and	their	eyes	go	in	the	back	of	their	head	,	and	the	fish	come	up	and	they	just	clean	,	clean	,	clean	--	because	the	molas	,	you	know	,	there	's	just	a	smorgasbord	of	parasites	.
and	it	's	also	a	great	place	to	go	down	south	because	the	water	's	warmer	,	and	the	molas	are	kind	of	friendly	down	there	.
i	mean	what	other	kind	of	fish	,	if	you	approach	it	right	,	will	say	,	``	okay	,	scratch	me	right	there	.	``
you	truly	can	swim	up	to	a	mola	--	they	're	very	gentle	--	and	if	you	approach	them	right	,	you	can	give	them	a	scratch	and	they	enjoy	it	.
so	we	've	also	tagged	one	part	of	the	pacific	;	we	've	gone	over	to	another	part	of	the	pacific	,	and	we	've	tagged	in	taiwan	,	and	we	tagged	in	japan	.
and	over	in	these	places	,	the	molas	are	caught	in	set	nets	that	line	these	countries	.
and	they	're	not	thrown	back	as	by	-	catch	,	they	're	eaten	.
we	were	served	a	nine	-	course	meal	of	mola	after	we	tagged	.
well	,	not	the	one	we	tagged	!
and	everything	from	the	kidney	,	to	the	testes	,	to	the	back	bone	,	to	the	fin	muscle	to	--	i	think	that	ís	pretty	much	the	whole	fish	--	is	eaten	.
so	the	hardest	part	of	tagging	,	now	,	is	after	you	put	that	tag	on	,	you	have	to	wait	,	months	.
and	you	're	just	wondering	,	oh	,	i	hope	the	fish	is	safe	,	i	hope	,	i	hope	it	's	going	to	be	able	to	actually	live	its	life	out	during	the	course	that	the	tag	is	recording	.
the	tags	cost	3500	dollars	each	,	and	then	satellite	time	is	another	500	dollars	,	so	you	're	like	,	oh	,	i	hope	the	tag	is	okay	.
and	so	the	waiting	is	really	the	hardest	part	.
i	'm	going	to	show	you	our	latest	dataset	.
and	it	has	n't	been	published	,	so	it	's	totally	privy	information	just	for	ted	.
and	in	showing	you	this	,	you	know	,	when	we	're	looking	at	this	data	,	we	're	thinking	,	oh	do	these	animals	,	do	they	cross	the	equator	?
do	they	go	from	one	side	of	the	pacific	to	the	other	?
and	we	found	that	they	kind	of	are	homebodies	.
they	're	not	big	migrators	.	this	is	their	track	:	we	deployed	the	tag	off	of	tokyo	,	and	the	mola	in	one	month	kind	of	got	into	the	kuroshio	current	off	of	japan	and	foraged	there	.
and	after	four	months	,	went	up	,	you	know	,	off	of	the	north	part	of	japan	.
and	that	's	kind	of	their	home	range	.
now	that	's	important	,	though	,	because	if	there	's	a	lot	of	fishing	pressure	,	that	population	does	n't	get	replenished	.
so	that	's	a	very	important	piece	of	data	.
but	also	what	's	important	is	that	they	're	not	slacker	,	lazy	fish	.
they	're	super	industrious	.
and	this	is	a	day	in	the	life	of	a	mola	,	and	if	we	--	they	're	up	and	down	,	and	up	and	down	,	and	up	and	down	,	and	up	and	up	and	down	,	up	to	40	times	a	day	.
as	the	sun	comes	up	,	you	see	in	the	blue	,	they	start	their	dive	.
down	--	and	as	the	sun	gets	brighter	they	go	a	little	deeper	,	little	deeper	.
they	plumb	the	depths	down	to	600	meters	,	in	temperatures	to	one	degree	centigrade	,	and	this	is	why	you	see	them	on	the	surface	--	it	's	so	cold	down	there	.
they	've	got	to	come	up	,	warm	,	get	that	solar	power	,	and	then	plunge	back	into	the	depths	,	and	go	up	and	down	and	up	and	down	.
and	they	're	hitting	a	layer	down	there	;	it	's	called	the	deep	scattering	layer	--	which	a	whole	variety	of	food	's	in	that	layer	.
so	rather	than	just	being	some	sunbathing	slacker	,	they	're	really	very	industrious	fish	that	dance	this	wild	dance	between	the	surface	and	the	bottom	and	through	temperature	.
we	see	the	same	pattern	--	now	with	these	tags	we	're	seeing	a	similar	pattern	for	swordfishes	,	manta	rays	,	tunas	,	a	real	three	-	dimensional	play	.
this	is	part	of	a	much	larger	program	called	the	census	of	marine	life	,	where	they	're	going	to	be	tagging	all	over	the	world	and	the	mola	's	going	to	enter	into	that	.
and	what	's	exciting	--	you	all	travel	,	and	you	know	the	best	thing	about	traveling	is	to	be	able	to	find	the	locals	,	and	to	find	the	great	places	by	getting	the	local	knowledge	.
well	now	with	the	census	of	marine	life	,	we	'll	be	able	to	sidle	up	to	all	the	locals	and	explore	90	percent	of	our	living	space	,	with	local	knowledge	.
it	's	never	--	it	's	really	never	been	a	more	exciting	,	or	a	vital	time	,	to	be	a	biologist	.
which	brings	me	to	my	last	point	,	and	what	i	think	is	kind	of	the	most	fun	.
i	set	up	a	website	because	i	was	getting	so	many	questions	about	molas	and	sunfish	.
and	so	i	just	figured	i	'd	have	the	questions	answered	,	and	i	'd	be	able	to	thank	my	funders	,	like	national	geographic	and	lindbergh	.
but	people	would	write	into	the	site	with	all	sorts	of	,	all	sorts	of	stories	about	these	animals	and	wanting	to	help	me	get	samples	for	genetic	analysis	.
and	what	i	found	most	exciting	is	that	everyone	had	a	shared	--	a	shared	love	and	an	interest	in	the	oceans	.
i	was	getting	reports	from	catholic	nuns	,	jewish	rabbis	,	muslims	,	christians	--	everybody	writing	in	,	united	by	their	love	of	life	.
and	to	me	that	--	i	do	n't	think	i	could	say	it	any	better	than	the	immortal	bard	himself	:	``	one	touch	of	nature	makes	the	whole	world	kin	.	``
and	sure	,	it	may	be	just	one	big	old	silly	fish	,	but	it	's	helping	.	if	it	's	helping	to	unite	the	world	,	i	think	it	's	definitely	the	fish	of	the	future	.
