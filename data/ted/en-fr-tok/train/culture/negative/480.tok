the	new	me	is	beauty	.
yeah	,	people	used	to	say	,	``	norman	's	ok	,	but	if	you	followed	what	he	said	,	everything	would	be	usable	but	it	would	be	ugly	.	``
well	,	i	did	n't	have	that	in	mind	,	so	...
this	is	neat	.
thank	you	for	setting	up	my	display	.
i	mean	,	it	's	just	wonderful	.
and	i	have	n't	the	slightest	idea	of	what	it	does	or	what	it	's	good	for	,	but	i	want	it	.
and	that	's	my	new	life	.
my	new	life	is	trying	to	understand	what	beauty	is	about	,	and	``	pretty	,	``	and	``	emotions	.	``
the	new	me	is	all	about	making	things	kind	of	neat	and	fun	.
and	so	this	is	a	philippe	starck	juicer	,	produced	by	alessi	.
it	's	just	neat	;	it	's	fun	.	it	's	so	much	fun	i	have	it	in	my	house	--	but	i	have	it	in	the	entryway	,	i	do	n't	use	it	to	make	juice	.
in	fact	,	i	bought	the	gold	-	plated	special	edition	and	it	comes	with	a	little	slip	of	paper	that	says	,	``	do	n't	use	this	juicer	to	make	juice	.	``
the	acid	will	ruin	the	gold	plating	.
so	actually	,	i	took	a	carton	of	orange	juice	and	i	poured	it	in	the	glass	to	take	this	picture	.
beneath	it	is	a	wonderful	knife	.
it	's	a	global	cutting	knife	made	in	japan	.
first	of	all	,	look	at	the	shape	--	it	's	just	wonderful	to	look	at	.
second	of	all	,	it	's	really	beautifully	balanced	:	it	holds	well	,	it	feels	well	.
and	third	of	all	,	it	's	so	sharp	,	it	just	cuts	.
it	's	a	delight	to	use	.
and	so	it	's	got	everything	,	right	?
it	's	beautiful	and	it	's	functional	.
and	i	can	tell	you	stories	about	it	,	which	makes	it	reflective	,	and	so	you	'll	see	i	have	a	theory	of	emotion	.
and	those	are	the	three	components	.
hiroshi	ishii	and	his	group	at	the	mit	media	lab	took	a	ping	-	pong	table	and	placed	a	projector	above	it	,	and	on	the	ping	-	pong	table	they	projected	an	image	of	water	with	fish	swimming	in	it	.
and	as	you	play	ping	-	pong	,	whenever	the	ball	hits	part	of	the	table	,	the	ripples	spread	out	and	the	fish	run	away	.
but	of	course	,	then	the	ball	hits	the	other	side	,	the	ripples	hit	the	--	poor	fish	,	they	ca	n't	find	any	peace	and	quiet	.
is	that	a	good	way	to	play	ping	-	pong	?
no	.	but	is	it	fun	?
yeah	!	yeah	.
or	look	at	google	.
if	you	type	in	,	oh	say	,	``	emotion	and	design	,	``	you	get	10	pages	of	results	.
so	google	just	took	their	logo	and	they	spread	it	out	.
instead	of	saying	,	``	you	got	73,000	results	.
this	is	one	through	20.	next	,	``	they	just	give	you	as	many	o	's	as	there	are	pages	.
it	's	really	simple	and	subtle	.
i	bet	a	lot	of	you	have	seen	it	and	never	noticed	it	.
that	's	the	subconscious	mind	that	sort	of	notices	it	--	it	probably	is	kind	of	pleasant	and	you	did	n't	know	why	.
and	it	's	just	clever	.
and	of	course	,	what	's	especially	good	is	,	if	you	type	``	design	and	emotion	,	``	the	first	response	out	of	those	10	pages	is	my	website	.
now	,	the	weird	thing	is	google	lies	,	because	if	i	type	``	design	and	emotion	,	``	it	says	,	``	you	do	n't	need	the	'	and	.	'	we	do	it	anyway	.	``	so	,	ok	.	so	i	type	``	design	emotion	``	and	my	website	was	n't	first	again	.
it	was	third	.
oh	well	,	different	story	.
there	was	this	wonderful	review	in	the	new	york	times	about	the	mini	cooper	automobile	.
it	said	,	``	you	know	,	this	is	a	car	that	has	lots	of	faults	.
buy	it	anyway	.
it	's	so	much	fun	to	drive	.	``
and	if	you	look	at	the	inside	of	the	car	--	i	mean	,	i	loved	it	,	i	wanted	to	see	it	,	i	rented	it	,	this	is	me	taking	a	picture	while	my	son	is	driving	--	and	the	inside	of	the	car	,	the	whole	design	is	fun	.
it	's	round	,	it	's	neat	.
the	controls	work	wonderfully	.
so	that	's	my	new	life	;	it	's	all	about	fun	.
i	really	have	the	feeling	that	pleasant	things	work	better	,	and	that	never	made	any	sense	to	me	until	i	finally	figured	out	--	look	...
i	'm	going	to	put	a	plank	on	the	ground	.
so	,	imagine	i	have	a	plank	about	two	feet	wide	and	30	feet	long
and	i	'm	going	to	walk	on	it	,	and	you	see	i	can	walk	on	it	without	looking	,
i	can	go	back	and	forth	and	i	can	jump	up	and	down	.
no	problem	.
now	i	'm	going	to	put	the	plank	300	feet	in	the	air	--
and	i	'm	not	going	to	go	near	it	,	thank	you	.
intense	fear	paralyzes	you	.
it	actually	affects	the	way	the	brain	works	.
so	,	paul	saffo	,	before	his	talk	said	that	he	did	n't	really	have	it	down	until	just	a	few	days	or	hours	before	the	talk	,	and	that	anxiety	was	really	helpful	in	causing	him	to	focus	.	that	's	what	fear	and	anxiety	does	;	it	causes	you	to	be	--	what	's	called	depth	-	first	processing	--	to	focus	,	not	be	distracted	.	and	i	could	n't	force	myself	across	that	.
now	some	people	can	--	circus	workers	,	steel	workers	.
but	it	really	changes	the	way	you	think	.
and	then	,	a	psychologist	,	alice	isen	,	did	this	wonderful	experiment	.
she	brought	students	in	to	solve	problems	.
so	,	she	'd	bring	people	into	the	room	,	and	there	'd	be	a	string	hanging	down	here	and	a	string	hanging	down	here	.	it	was	an	empty	room	,	except	for	a	table	with	a	bunch	of	crap	on	it	--	some	papers	and	scissors	and	stuff	.
and	she	'd	bring	them	in	,	and	she	'd	say	,	``	this	is	an	iq	test	and	it	determines	how	well	you	do	in	life	.
would	you	tie	those	two	strings	together	?	``
so	they	'd	take	one	string	and	they	'd	pull	it	over	here	and	they	could	n't	reach	the	other	string	.
still	ca	n't	reach	it	.
and	,	basically	,	none	of	them	could	solve	it	.
you	bring	in	a	second	group	of	people	,	and	you	say	,	``	oh	,	before	we	start	,	i	got	this	box	of	candy	,	and	i	do	n't	eat	candy	.
would	you	like	the	box	of	candy	?	``
and	turns	out	they	liked	it	,	and	it	made	them	happy	--
not	very	happy	,	but	a	little	bit	of	happy	.
and	guess	what	--	they	solved	the	problem	.
and	it	turns	out	that	when	you	're	anxious	you	squirt	neural	transmitters	in	the	brain	,	which	focuses	you	makes	you	depth	-	first	.	and	when	you	're	happy	--	what	we	call	positive	valence	--	you	squirt	dopamine	into	the	prefrontal	lobes	,	which	makes	you	a	breadth	-	first	problem	solver	:	you	're	more	susceptible	to	interruption	;	you	do	out	-	of	-	the	-	box	thinking	.
that	's	what	brainstorming	is	about	,	right	?
with	brainstorming	we	make	you	happy	,	we	play	games	,	and	we	say	,	``	no	criticism	,	``	and	you	get	all	these	weird	,	neat	ideas	.	but	in	fact	,	if	that	's	how	you	always	were	you	'd	never	get	any	work	done	because	you	'd	be	working	along	and	say	,	``	oh	,	i	got	a	new	way	of	doing	it	.	``
so	to	get	work	done	,	you	've	got	to	set	a	deadline	,	right	?
you	've	got	be	anxious	.
the	brain	works	differently	if	you	're	happy	.	things	work	better	because	you	're	more	creative	.	you	get	a	little	problem	,	you	say	,	``	ah	,	i	'll	figure	it	out	.	``
no	big	deal	.
there	's	something	i	call	the	visceral	level	of	processing	,	and	there	will	be	visceral	-	level	design	.
biology	--	we	have	co	-	adapted	through	biology	to	like	bright	colors	.
that	's	especially	good	that	mammals	and	primates	like	fruits	and	bright	plants	,	because	you	eat	the	fruit	and	you	thereby	spread	the	seed	.
there	's	an	amazing	amount	of	stuff	that	's	built	into	the	brain	.
we	dislike	bitter	tastes	,	we	dislike	loud	sounds	,	we	dislike	hot	temperatures	,	cold	temperatures	.
we	dislike	scolding	voices	.	we	dislike	frowning	faces	;	we	like	symmetrical	faces	,	etc	.	,	etc	.
so	that	's	the	visceral	level	.	in	design	,	you	can	express	visceral	in	lots	of	ways	,	like	the	choice	of	type	fonts	and	the	red	for	hot	,	exciting	.
or	the	1963	jaguar	:
it	's	actually	a	crummy	car	,	falls	apart	all	the	time	,	but	the	owners	love	it	.
and	it	's	beautiful	--	it	's	in	the	museum	of	modern	art	.
a	water	bottle	:
you	buy	it	because	of	the	bottle	,	not	because	of	the	water	.
and	when	people	are	finished	,	they	do	n't	throw	it	away	.	they	keep	it	for	--	you	know	,	it	's	like	the	old	wine	bottles	,	you	keep	it	for	decoration	or	maybe	fill	it	with	water	again	,	which	proves	it	's	not	the	water	.
it	's	all	about	the	visceral	experience	.
the	middle	level	of	processing	is	the	behavioral	level	and	that	's	actually	where	most	of	our	stuff	gets	done	.
visceral	is	subconscious	,	you	're	unaware	of	it	.	behavioral	is	subconscious	,	you	're	unaware	of	it	.
almost	everything	we	do	is	subconscious	.
i	'm	walking	around	the	stage	--	i	'm	not	attending	to	the	control	of	my	legs	.
i	'm	doing	a	lot	;	most	of	my	talk	is	subconscious	;	it	has	been	rehearsed	and	thought	about	a	lot	.
most	of	what	we	do	is	subconscious	.
automatic	behavior	--	skilled	behavior	--	is	subconscious	,	controlled	by	the	behavioral	side	.
and	behavioral	design	is	all	about	feeling	in	control	,	which	includes	usability	,	understanding	--	but	also	the	feel	and	heft	.
that	's	why	the	global	knives	are	so	neat	.	they	're	so	nicely	balanced	,	so	sharp	,	that	you	really	feel	you	're	in	control	of	the	cutting	.
or	,	just	driving	a	high	-	performance	sports	car	over	a	demanding	curb	--	again	,	feeling	that	you	are	in	complete	control	of	the	environment	.
or	the	sensual	feeling	.
this	is	a	kohler	shower	,	a	waterfall	shower	,	and	actually	,	all	those	knobs	beneath	are	also	showerheads	.
it	will	squirt	you	all	around	and	you	can	stay	in	that	shower	for	hours	--
and	not	waste	water	,	by	the	way	,	because	it	recirculates	the	same	dirty	water	.
or	this	--	this	is	a	really	neat	teapot	i	found	at	high	tea	at	the	four	seasons	hotel	in	chicago	.
it	's	a	ronnefeldt	tilting	teapot	.
that	's	kind	of	what	the	teapot	looks	like	but	the	way	you	use	it	is	you	lay	it	on	its	back	,	and	you	put	tea	in	,	and	then	you	fill	it	with	water	.	the	water	then	seeps	over	the	tea	.
and	the	tea	is	sitting	in	this	stuff	to	the	right	--	the	tea	is	to	the	right	of	this	line	.
there	's	a	little	ledge	inside	,	so	the	tea	is	sitting	there	and	the	water	is	filling	it	up	like	that	.
and	when	the	tea	is	ready	,	or	almost	ready	,	you	tilt	it	.
and	that	means	the	tea	is	partially	covered	while	it	completes	the	brewing	.
and	when	it	's	finished	,	you	put	it	vertically	,	and	now	the	tea	is	--	you	remember	--	above	this	line	and	the	water	only	comes	to	here	--	and	so	it	keeps	the	tea	out	.	on	top	of	that	,	it	communicates	,	which	is	what	emotion	does	.
emotion	is	all	about	acting	;	emotion	is	really	about	acting	.
it	's	being	safe	in	the	world	.
cognition	is	about	understanding	the	world	,	emotion	is	about	interpreting	it	--	saying	good	,	bad	,	safe	,	dangerous	,	and	getting	us	ready	to	act	,	which	is	why	the	muscles	tense	or	relax	.
and	that	's	why	we	can	tell	the	emotion	of	somebody	else	--	because	their	muscles	are	acting	,	subconsciously	,	except	that	we	've	evolved	to	make	the	facial	muscles	really	rich	with	emotion	.
well	,	this	has	emotions	if	you	like	,	because	it	signals	the	waiter	that	,	``	hey	,	i	'm	finished	.	see	--	upright	.	``
and	the	waiter	can	come	by	and	say	,	``	would	you	like	more	water	?	``
it	's	kind	of	neat	.	what	a	wonderful	design	.
and	the	third	level	is	reflective	,	which	is	,	if	you	like	the	superego	,	it	's	a	little	part	of	the	brain	that	has	no	control	over	what	you	do	,	no	control	over	the	--	does	n't	see	the	senses	,	does	n't	control	the	muscles	.
it	looks	over	what	's	going	on	.
it	's	that	little	voice	in	your	head	that	's	watching	and	saying	,	``	that	's	good	.	that	's	bad	.	``
or	,	``	why	are	you	doing	that	?	i	do	n't	understand	.	``
it	's	that	little	voice	in	your	head	that	's	the	seat	of	consciousness	.
here	's	a	great	reflective	product	.
owners	of	the	hummer	have	said	,	``	you	know	i	've	owned	many	cars	in	my	life	--	all	sorts	of	exotic	cars	,	but	never	have	i	had	a	car	that	attracted	so	much	attention	.	``
it	's	about	attention	.	it	's	about	their	image	,	not	about	the	car	.
if	you	want	a	more	positive	model	--	this	is	the	gm	car	.
and	the	reason	you	might	buy	it	now	is	because	you	care	about	the	environment	.
and	you	'll	buy	it	to	protect	the	environment	,	even	though	the	first	few	cars	are	going	to	be	really	expensive	and	not	perfected	.
but	that	's	reflective	design	as	well	.
or	an	expensive	watch	,	so	you	can	impress	people	--	``	oh	gee	,	i	did	n't	know	you	had	that	watch	.	``
as	opposed	to	this	one	,	which	is	a	pure	behavioral	watch	,	which	probably	keeps	better	time	than	the	$	13,000	watch	i	just	showed	you	.
but	it	's	ugly	.
this	is	a	clear	don	norman	watch	.
and	what	's	neat	is	sometimes	you	pit	one	emotion	against	the	other	,	the	visceral	fear	of	falling	against	the	reflective	state	saying	,	``	it	's	ok	.	it	's	ok	.	it	's	safe	.	it	's	safe	.	``
if	that	amusement	park	were	rusty	and	falling	apart	,	you	'd	never	go	on	the	ride	.
so	,	it	's	pitting	one	against	the	other	.
the	other	neat	thing	...	so	jake	cress	is	this	furniture	maker	,	and	he	makes	this	unbelievable	set	of	furniture	.
and	this	is	his	chair	with	claw	,	and	the	poor	little	chair	has	lost	its	ball	and	it	's	trying	to	get	it	back	before	anybody	notices	.
and	what	's	so	neat	about	it	is	how	you	accept	that	story	.
and	that	's	what	's	nice	about	emotion	.
so	that	's	the	new	me	.
i	'm	only	saying	positive	things	from	now	on	.
