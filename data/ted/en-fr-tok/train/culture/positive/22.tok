hey	,	i	am	michael	shermer	,	the	director	of	the	skeptics	society	,	the	publisher	of	``	skeptic	``	magazine	.
we	investigate	claims	of	the	paranormal	,	pseudo	-	science	,	and	fringe	groups	and	cults	and	claims	of	all	kinds	between	--	science	and	pseudo	-	science	and	non	-	science	and	junk	science	,	voodoo	science	,	pathological	science	,	bad	science	,	non	-	science	and	plain	old	nonsense	.
and	unless	you	've	been	on	mars	recently	,	you	know	there	's	a	lot	of	that	out	there	.
some	people	call	us	debunkers	,	which	is	kind	of	a	negative	term	.
but	let	's	face	it	--	there	's	a	lot	of	bunk	,	and	we	are	like	the	bunko	squads	of	the	police	departments	out	there	,	flushing	out	.
well	,	we	're	sort	of	like	the	ralph	naders	of	bad	ideas	--	trying	to	replace	bad	ideas	with	good	ideas	.
i	'll	show	you	an	example	of	a	bad	idea	.
i	brought	this	with	me	.
this	was	given	to	us	by	nbc	dateline	to	test	.
it	's	the	--	it	's	produced	by	the	quadro	corporation	of	west	virginia	.
it	's	called	the	quadro	2000	dowser	rod	.
this	was	being	sold	to	high	school	administrators	for	900	dollars	a	piece	.
it	's	a	piece	of	plastic	with	a	radio	shack	antenna	attached	to	it	.
you	could	dowse	for	all	sorts	of	things	,	but	this	particular	one	was	built	to	dowse	for	marijuana	in	students	'	lockers	.
so	the	way	it	works	is	,	you	go	down	the	hallway	and	you	see	if	it	tilts	toward	a	particular	locker	,	and	then	you	open	the	locker	.
so	it	looks	something	like	this	.
i	'll	show	you	.
no	,	it	--	well	,	it	has	kind	of	a	right	-	leaning	bias	.
so	,	i	'll	show	--	well	,	this	is	science	,	so	we	'll	do	a	controlled	experiment	.
it	'll	go	this	way	for	sure	.
sir	,	you	want	to	empty	your	pockets	.	please	,	sir	?
so	the	question	was	,	can	it	actually	find	marijuana	in	students	'	lockers	?
and	the	answer	is	,	if	you	open	enough	of	them	,	yes	.
but	in	science	,	we	have	to	keep	track	of	the	misses	,	not	just	the	hits	.
and	that	's	probably	the	key	lesson	to	my	short	talk	here	,	is	that	this	is	how	psychics	work	,	astrologers	,	and	tarot	card	readers	and	so	on	.
people	remember	the	hits	;	they	forget	the	misses	.
in	science	we	have	to	keep	the	whole	database	,	and	look	to	see	if	the	number	of	hits	somehow	stands	out	from	the	total	number	that	you	would	expect	by	chance	.
in	this	case	,	we	tested	it	.
we	had	two	opaque	boxes	:	one	with	government	-	approved	thc	marijuana	,	and	one	with	nothing	.
and	it	got	it	50	percent	of	the	time	--
which	is	exactly	what	you	'd	expect	with	a	coin	flip	model	.
so	that	's	just	a	fun	little	example	here	of	the	sorts	of	things	we	do	.
``	skeptic	``	is	the	quarterly	publication	.
each	one	has	a	particular	theme	,	like	this	one	is	on	the	future	of	intelligence	.
are	people	getting	smarter	or	dumber	?
i	have	an	opinion	of	this	myself	because	of	the	business	i	'm	in	,
but	,	in	fact	,	people	,	it	turns	out	,	are	getting	smarter	.
three	iq	points	per	10	years	,	going	up	.
sort	of	an	interesting	thing	.
with	science	,	do	n't	think	of	skepticism	as	a	thing	or	even	science	as	a	thing	.
are	science	and	religion	compatible	?
it	's	like	,	are	science	and	plumbing	compatible	?
these	--	they	're	just	two	different	things	.
science	is	not	a	thing	.	it	's	a	verb	.
it	's	a	way	of	thinking	about	things	.
it	's	a	way	of	looking	for	natural	explanations	for	all	phenomena	.
i	mean	,	what	's	more	likely	:	that	extraterrestrial	intelligences	or	multi	-	dimensional	beings	travel	across	the	vast	distances	of	interstellar	space	to	leave	a	crop	circle	in	farmer	bob	's	field	in	puckerbrush	,	kansas	to	promote	skeptic.com	,	our	webpage	?
or	is	it	more	likely	that	a	reader	of	``	skeptic	``	did	this	with	photoshop	?
and	in	all	cases	we	have	to	ask	--	what	's	the	more	likely	explanation	?
and	before	we	say	something	is	out	of	this	world	,	we	should	first	make	sure	that	it	's	not	in	this	world	.
what	's	more	likely	--	that	arnold	had	a	little	extraterrestrial	help	in	his	run	for	the	governorship	?
or	that	the	``	world	weekly	news	``	makes	stuff	up	?
and	part	of	that	--	the	same	theme	is	expressed	nicely	here	in	this	sidney	harris	cartoon	.
for	those	of	you	in	the	back	,	it	says	here	:	``	then	a	miracle	occurs	.
i	think	you	need	to	be	more	explicit	here	in	step	two	.	``
this	single	slide	completely	dismantles	the	intelligent	design	arguments	.
there	's	nothing	more	to	it	than	that	.
you	can	say	a	miracle	occurs	.
it	's	just	that	it	does	n't	explain	anything	.
it	does	n't	offer	anything	.	there	's	nothing	to	test	.
it	's	the	end	of	the	conversation	for	intelligent	design	creationists	.
whereas	--	and	it	's	true	,	scientists	sometimes	throw	terms	out	as	linguistic	place	fillers	--	dark	energy	or	dark	matter	or	something	like	that	--
until	we	figure	out	what	it	is	,	we	'll	just	call	it	this	--
it	's	the	beginning	of	the	causal	chain	for	science	.
for	intelligent	design	creationists	,	it	's	the	end	of	the	chain	.
so	again	,	we	can	ask	this	:	what	's	more	likely	?	are	ufos	alien	spaceships	or	perceptual	cognitive	mistakes	--	or	even	fakes	?
this	is	a	ufo	shot	from	my	house	in	altadena	,	california	,	looking	down	over	pasadena	.
and	if	it	looks	a	lot	like	a	buick	hubcap	,	it	's	because	it	is	.
you	do	n't	even	need	photoshop	;	you	do	n't	need	high	-	tech	equipment	;	you	do	n't	need	computers	.
this	was	shot	with	a	throwaway	kodak	instamatic	camera	.
you	just	have	somebody	off	on	the	side	with	a	hubcap	ready	to	go	.
camera	's	ready	--	that	's	it	.
so	,	although	it	's	possible	that	most	of	these	things	are	fake	or	illusions	or	so	on	and	that	some	of	them	are	real	,	it	's	more	likely	that	all	of	them	are	fake	,	like	the	crop	circles	.
on	a	more	serious	note	,	in	all	of	science	we	're	looking	for	a	balance	between	data	and	theory	.
in	the	case	of	galileo	,	he	had	two	problems	when	he	turned	his	telescope	to	saturn	.
first	of	all	,	there	was	no	theory	of	planetary	rings	.
and	second	of	all	,	his	data	was	grainy	and	fuzzy	,	and	he	could	n't	quite	make	out	what	it	was	he	was	looking	at	.
so	he	wrote	that	he	had	seen	--	``	i	have	observed	that	the	furthest	planet	has	three	bodies	.	``
and	this	is	what	he	ended	up	concluding	that	he	saw	.
so	without	a	theory	of	planetary	rings	and	with	only	grainy	data	,	you	ca	n't	have	a	good	theory	.
and	it	was	n't	solved	until	1655	.
this	is	christiaan	huygens	's	book	in	which	he	cataloged	all	the	mistakes	that	people	made	in	trying	to	figure	out	what	was	going	on	with	saturn	.
it	was	n't	till	--	huygens	had	two	things	.
he	had	a	good	theory	of	planetary	rings	and	how	the	solar	system	operated	.
and	then	,	he	had	better	telescopic	,	more	fine	-	grain	data	in	which	he	could	figure	out	that	as	the	earth	is	going	around	faster	--	according	to	kepler	's	laws	--	than	saturn	,	then	we	catch	up	with	it	.
and	we	see	the	angles	of	the	rings	at	different	angles	,	there	.
and	that	,	in	fact	,	turns	out	to	be	true	.
the	problems	with	having	a	theory	is	that	your	theory	may	be	loaded	with	cognitive	biases	.	so	one	of	the	problems	of	explaining	why	people	believe	weird	things	is	that	we	have	things	on	a	simple	level	.
and	then	i	'll	go	to	more	serious	ones	.
like	,	we	have	a	tendency	to	see	faces	.
this	is	the	face	on	mars	,	which	was	--	in	1976	,	where	there	was	a	whole	movement	to	get	nasa	to	photograph	that	area	because	people	thought	this	was	monumental	architecture	made	by	martians	.
well	,	it	turns	out	--	here	's	the	close	-	up	of	it	from	2001	.
if	you	squint	,	you	can	still	see	the	face	.
and	when	you	're	squinting	,	what	you	're	doing	is	you	're	turning	that	from	fine	-	grain	to	coarse	-	grain	.
and	so	,	you	're	reducing	the	quality	of	your	data	.
and	if	i	did	n't	tell	you	what	to	look	for	,	you	'd	still	see	the	face	,	because	we	're	programmed	by	evolution	to	see	faces	.
faces	are	important	for	us	socially	.
and	,	of	course	,	happy	faces	.
faces	of	all	kinds	are	easy	to	see	.
you	can	see	the	happy	face	on	mars	,	there	.
if	astronomers	were	frogs	perhaps	they	'd	see	kermit	the	frog	.
do	you	see	him	there	?
little	froggy	legs	.
or	if	geologists	were	elephants	?
religious	iconography	.
discovered	by	a	tennessee	baker	in	1996	.
he	charged	five	bucks	a	head	to	come	see	the	nun	bun	till	he	got	a	cease	-	and	-	desist	from	mother	teresa	's	lawyer	.
here	's	our	lady	of	guadalupe	and	our	lady	of	watsonville	,	just	down	the	street	,
or	is	it	up	the	street	from	here	?
tree	bark	is	particularly	good	because	it	's	nice	and	grainy	,	branchy	,	black	-	and	-	white	splotchy	and	you	can	get	the	pattern	-	seeking	--	humans	are	pattern	-	seeking	animals	.
here	's	the	virgin	mary	on	the	side	of	a	glass	window	in	sao	paulo	.
now	,	here	's	the	virgin	mary	made	her	appearance	on	a	cheese	sandwich	--	which	i	got	to	actually	hold	in	a	las	vegas	casino	,	of	course	,	this	being	america	.
this	casino	paid	28,500	dollars	on	ebay	for	the	cheese	sandwich	.
but	who	does	it	really	look	like	,	the	virgin	mary	?
it	has	that	sort	of	puckered	lips	,	1940s	-	era	look	.
virgin	mary	in	clearwater	,	florida	.
i	actually	went	to	see	this	one	.
there	was	a	lot	of	people	there	--	the	faithful	come	to	be	in	their	--	wheelchairs	and	crutches	,	and	so	on	.
and	we	went	down	,	investigated	.
just	to	give	you	a	size	--	that	's	dawkins	,	me	and	the	amazing	randi	,	next	to	this	two	,	two	and	a	half	story	size	image	.
all	these	candles	,	so	many	thousands	of	candles	people	had	lit	in	tribute	to	this	.
so	we	walked	around	the	backside	,	just	to	see	what	was	going	on	here	,	where	--	it	turns	out	wherever	there	's	a	sprinkler	head	and	a	palm	tree	,	you	get	the	effect	.
here	's	the	virgin	mary	on	the	backside	,	which	they	started	to	wipe	off	.
i	guess	you	can	only	have	one	miracle	per	building	.
so	is	it	really	a	miracle	of	mary	,	or	is	it	a	miracle	of	marge	?
and	then	i	'm	going	to	finish	up	with	another	example	of	this	with	audio	--	auditory	illusions	.
there	is	this	film	,	``	white	noise	,	``	with	michael	keaton	about	the	dead	talking	back	to	us	.
by	the	way	,	this	whole	business	of	talking	to	the	dead	,	it	's	not	that	big	a	deal	.
anybody	can	do	it	,	turns	out	.
it	's	getting	the	dead	to	talk	back	that	's	the	really	hard	part	.
in	this	case	,	supposedly	,	these	messages	are	hidden	in	electronic	phenomena	.
there	's	a	reversespeech.com	web	page	from	which	i	downloaded	this	stuff	.
here	is	the	forward	--	this	is	the	most	famous	one	of	all	of	these	.
here	's	the	forward	version	of	the	very	famous	song	.
boy	,	could	n't	you	just	listen	to	that	all	day	?
all	right	,	here	it	is	backwards	,	and	see	if	you	can	hear	the	hidden	messages	that	are	supposedly	in	there	.
what	did	you	get	?
audience	:	``	satan	.	``	michael	shermer	:	``	satan	?	``	ok	,	well	,	at	least	we	got	``	satan	.	``
now	,	i	'll	prime	your	auditory	part	of	your	brain	to	tell	you	what	you	're	supposed	to	hear	,	and	then	hear	it	again	.
you	ca	n't	miss	it	when	i	tell	you	what	's	there	.
all	right	,	i	'm	going	to	just	end	with	a	positive	,	nice	,	little	story	about	--	the	skeptics	is	a	nonprofit	educational	organization	.
we	're	always	looking	for	little	,	good	things	that	people	do	.
and	in	england	,	there	's	a	pop	singer	.
very	--	one	of	the	top	popular	singers	in	england	today	,	katie	melua	.
and	she	wrote	a	beautiful	song	.
it	was	in	the	top	five	in	2005	,	called	,	``	nine	million	bicycles	in	beijing	.	``
it	's	a	love	story	--	she	's	sort	of	the	norah	jones	of	the	u.k.	--	about	how	she	much	loves	her	guy	,	and	compared	to	nine	million	bicycles	,	and	so	forth	.
and	she	has	this	one	passage	here	.
♫	we	are	12	billion	light	-	years	from	the	edge	♫	♫	that	's	a	guess	♫	♫	no	one	can	ever	say	it	's	true	♫	♫	but	i	know	that	i	will	always	be	with	you	♫	well	,	that	's	nice	.
at	least	she	got	it	close	.	in	america	it	would	be	,	``	we	're	6,000	light	years	from	the	edge	.	``
but	my	friend	,	simon	singh	,	the	particle	physicist	now	turned	science	educator	,	and	he	wrote	the	book	``	the	big	bang	,	``	and	so	on	.
he	uses	every	chance	he	gets	to	promote	good	science	.
and	so	,	he	wrote	an	op	-	ed	piece	in	``	the	guardian	``	about	katie	's	song	,	in	which	he	said	,	well	,	we	know	exactly	how	old	,	how	far	from	the	edge	.
you	know	,	it	's	12	--	it	's	13.7	billion	light	years	,	and	it	's	not	a	guess	.
we	know	within	precise	error	bars	there	how	close	it	is	.
and	so	,	we	can	say	,	although	not	absolutely	true	,	that	it	's	pretty	close	to	being	true	.
and	,	to	his	credit	,	katie	called	him	up	after	this	op	-	ed	piece	came	out	.
and	said	,	``	i	'm	so	embarrassed	.
i	was	a	member	of	the	astronomy	club	,	and	i	should	have	known	better	.	``
and	she	re	-	cut	the	song	.
so	i	'll	end	with	the	new	version	.
♫	we	are	13.7	billion	light	years	♫	♫	from	the	edge	of	the	observable	universe	♫	♫	that	's	a	good	estimate	with	well	-	defined	error	bars	♫	♫	and	with	the	available	information	♫	♫	i	predict	that	i	will	always	be	with	you	♫	how	cool	is	that	?
