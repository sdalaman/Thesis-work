the	key	question	is	,	``	when	are	we	going	to	get	fusion	?	``
it	's	really	been	a	long	time	since	we	've	known	about	fusion	.
we	've	known	about	fusion	since	1920	,	when	sir	arthur	stanley	eddington	and	the	british	association	for	the	advancement	of	science	conjectured	that	that	's	why	the	sun	shines	.
i	've	always	been	very	worried	about	resource	.
i	do	n't	know	about	you	,	but	when	my	mother	gave	me	food	,	i	always	sorted	the	ones	i	disliked	from	the	ones	i	liked	.
and	i	ate	the	disliked	ones	first	,	because	the	ones	you	like	,	you	want	to	save	.
and	as	a	child	you	're	always	worried	about	resource	.
and	once	it	was	sort	of	explained	to	me	how	fast	we	were	using	up	the	world	's	resources	,	i	got	very	upset	,	about	as	upset	as	i	did	when	i	realized	that	the	earth	will	only	last	about	five	billion	years	before	it	's	swallowed	by	the	sun	.
big	events	in	my	life	,
a	strange	child	.
energy	,	at	the	moment	,	is	dominated	by	resource	.
the	countries	that	make	a	lot	of	money	out	of	energy	have	something	underneath	them	.
coal	-	powered	industrial	revolution	in	this	country	--	oil	,	gas	,	sorry	.
gas	,	i	'm	probably	the	only	person	who	really	enjoys	it	when	mister	putin	turns	off	the	gas	tap	,	because	my	budget	goes	up	.
we	're	really	dominated	now	by	those	things	that	we	're	using	up	faster	and	faster	and	faster	.
and	as	we	try	to	lift	billions	of	people	out	of	poverty	in	the	third	world	,	in	the	developing	world	,	we	're	using	energy	faster	and	faster	.
and	those	resources	are	going	away	.
and	the	way	we	'll	make	energy	in	the	future	is	not	from	resource	,	it	's	really	from	knowledge	.
if	you	look	50	years	into	the	future	,	the	way	we	probably	will	be	making	energy	is	probably	one	of	these	three	,	with	some	wind	,	with	some	other	things	,	but	these	are	going	to	be	the	base	load	energy	drivers	.
solar	can	do	it	,	and	we	certainly	have	to	develop	solar	.	but	we	have	a	lot	of	knowledge	to	gain	before	we	can	make	solar	the	base	load	energy	supply	for	the	world	.
fission	.
our	government	is	going	to	put	in	six	new	nuclear	power	stations	.
they	're	going	to	put	in	six	new	nuclear	power	stations	,	and	probably	more	after	that	.
china	is	building	nuclear	power	stations	.	everybody	is	.	because	they	know	that	that	is	one	sure	way	to	do	carbon	-	free	energy	.
but	if	you	wanted	to	know	what	the	perfect	energy	source	is	,	the	perfect	energy	source	is	one	that	does	n't	take	up	much	space	,	has	a	virtually	inexhaustible	supply	,	is	safe	,	does	n't	put	any	carbon	into	the	atmosphere	,	does	n't	leave	any	long	-	lived	radioactive	waste	:	it	's	fusion	.
but	there	is	a	catch	.	of	course	there	is	always	a	catch	in	these	cases	.
fusion	is	very	hard	to	do	.
we	've	been	trying	for	50	years	.
okay	.	what	is	fusion	?	here	comes	the	nuclear	physics	.
and	sorry	about	that	,	but	this	is	what	turns	me	on	.
i	was	a	strange	child	.
nuclear	energy	comes	for	a	simple	reason	.
the	most	stable	nucleus	is	iron	,	right	in	the	middle	of	the	periodic	table	.
it	's	a	medium	-	sized	nucleus	.
and	you	want	to	go	towards	iron	if	you	want	to	get	energy	.
so	,	uranium	,	which	is	very	big	,	wants	to	split	.	but	small	atoms	want	to	join	together	,	small	nuclei	want	to	join	together	to	make	bigger	ones	to	go	towards	iron	.
and	you	can	get	energy	out	this	way	.
and	indeed	that	's	exactly	what	stars	do	.
in	the	middle	of	stars	,	you	're	joining	hydrogen	together	to	make	helium	and	then	helium	together	to	make	carbon	,	to	make	oxygen	,	all	the	things	that	you	're	made	of	are	made	in	the	middle	of	stars	.
but	it	's	a	hard	process	to	do	because	,	as	you	know	,	the	middle	of	a	star	is	quite	hot	,	almost	by	definition	.
and	there	is	one	reaction	that	's	probably	the	easiest	fusion	reaction	to	do	.
it	's	between	two	isotopes	of	hydrogen	,	two	kinds	of	hydrogen	:	deuterium	,	which	is	heavy	hydrogen	,	which	you	can	get	from	seawater	,	and	tritium	which	is	super	-	heavy	hydrogen	.
these	two	nuclei	,	when	they	're	far	apart	,	are	charged	.
and	you	push	them	together	and	they	repel	.
but	when	you	get	them	close	enough	,	something	called	the	strong	force	starts	to	act	and	pulls	them	together	.
so	,	most	of	the	time	they	repel	.	you	get	them	closer	and	closer	and	closer	and	then	at	some	point	the	strong	force	grips	them	together	.
for	a	moment	they	become	helium	5	,	because	they	've	got	five	particles	inside	them	.
so	,	that	's	that	process	there	.	deuterium	and	tritium	goes	together	makes	helium	5	.
helium	splits	out	,	and	a	neutron	comes	out	and	lots	of	energy	comes	out	.
if	you	can	get	something	to	about	150	million	degrees	,	things	will	be	rattling	around	so	fast	that	every	time	they	collide	in	just	the	right	configuration	,	this	will	happen	,	and	it	will	release	energy	.
and	that	energy	is	what	powers	fusion	.
and	it	's	this	reaction	that	we	want	to	do	.
there	is	one	trickiness	about	this	reaction	.
well	,	there	is	a	trickiness	that	you	have	to	make	it	150	million	degrees	,	but	there	is	a	trickiness	about	the	reaction	yet	.
it	's	pretty	hot	.
the	trickiness	about	the	reaction	is	that	tritium	does	n't	exist	in	nature	.
you	have	to	make	it	from	something	else	.
and	you	make	if	from	lithium	.	that	reaction	at	the	bottom	,	that	's	lithium	6	,	plus	a	neutron	,	will	give	you	more	helium	,	plus	tritium	.
and	that	's	the	way	you	make	your	tritium	.
but	fortunately	,	if	you	can	do	this	fusion	reaction	,	you	've	got	a	neutron	,	so	you	can	make	that	happen	.
now	,	why	the	hell	would	we	bother	to	do	this	?
this	is	basically	why	we	would	bother	to	do	it	.
if	you	just	plot	how	much	fuel	we	've	got	left	,	in	units	of	present	world	consumption	.
and	as	you	go	across	there	you	see	a	few	tens	of	years	of	oil	--	the	blue	line	,	by	the	way	,	is	the	lowest	estimate	of	existing	resources	.	and	the	yellow	line	is	the	most	optimistic	estimate	.
and	as	you	go	across	there	you	will	see	that	we	've	got	a	few	tens	of	years	,	and	perhaps	100	years	of	fossil	fuels	left	.
and	god	knows	we	do	n't	really	want	to	burn	all	of	it	,	because	it	will	make	an	awful	lot	of	carbon	in	the	air	.
and	then	we	get	to	uranium	.
and	with	current	reactor	technology	we	really	do	n't	have	very	much	uranium	.
and	we	will	have	to	extract	uranium	from	sea	water	,	which	is	the	yellow	line	,	to	make	conventional	nuclear	power	stations	actually	do	very	much	for	us	.
this	is	a	bit	shocking	,	because	in	fact	our	government	is	relying	on	that	for	us	to	meet	kyoto	,	and	do	all	those	kind	of	things	.
to	go	any	further	you	would	have	to	have	breeder	technology	.
and	breeder	technology	is	fast	breeders	.	and	that	's	pretty	dangerous	.
the	big	thing	,	on	the	right	,	is	the	lithium	we	have	in	the	world	.
and	lithium	is	in	sea	water	.	that	's	the	yellow	line	.
and	we	have	30	million	years	worth	of	fusion	fuel	in	sea	water	.
everybody	can	get	it	.	that	's	why	we	want	to	do	fusion	.
is	it	cost	-	competitive	?
we	make	estimates	of	what	we	think	it	would	cost	to	actually	make	a	fusion	power	plant	.
and	we	get	within	about	the	same	price	as	current	electricity	.
so	,	how	would	we	make	it	?
we	have	to	hold	something	at	150	million	degrees	.
and	,	in	fact	,	we	've	done	this	.
we	hold	it	with	a	magnetic	field	.
and	inside	it	,	right	in	the	middle	of	this	toroidal	shape	,	doughnut	shape	,	right	in	the	middle	is	150	million	degrees	.
it	boils	away	in	the	middle	at	150	million	degrees	.
and	in	fact	we	can	make	fusion	happen	.
and	just	down	the	road	,	this	is	jet	.
it	's	the	only	machine	in	the	world	that	's	actually	done	fusion	.
when	people	say	fusion	is	30	years	away	,	and	always	will	be	,	i	say	,	``	yeah	,	but	we	've	actually	done	it	.	``	right	?
we	can	do	fusion	.	in	the	center	of	this	device	we	made	16	megawatts	of	fusion	power	in	1997	.
and	in	2013	we	're	going	to	fire	it	up	again	and	break	all	those	records	.	but	that	's	not	really	fusion	power	.	that	's	just	making	some	fusion	happen	.
we	've	got	to	take	that	,	we	've	got	to	make	that	into	a	fusion	reactor	.	because	we	want	30	million	years	worth	of	fusion	power	for	the	earth	.
this	is	the	device	we	're	building	now	.
it	gets	very	expensive	to	do	this	research	.
it	turns	out	you	ca	n't	do	fusion	on	a	table	top	despite	all	that	cold	fusion	nonsense	.	right	?
you	ca	n't	.	you	have	to	do	it	in	a	very	big	device	.
more	than	half	the	world	's	population	is	involved	in	building	this	device	in	southern	france	,	which	is	a	nice	place	to	put	an	experiment	.
seven	nations	are	involved	in	building	this	.
it	's	going	to	cost	us	10	billion	.	and	we	'll	produce	half	a	gigawatt	of	fusion	power	.	but	that	's	not	electricity	yet	.
we	have	to	get	to	this	.
we	have	to	get	to	a	power	plant	.
we	have	to	start	putting	electricity	on	the	grid	in	this	very	complex	technology	.
and	i	'd	really	like	it	to	happen	a	lot	faster	than	it	is	.	but	at	the	moment	,	all	we	can	imagine	is	sometime	in	the	2030s	.
i	wish	this	were	different	.	we	really	need	it	now	.
we	're	going	to	have	a	problem	with	power	in	the	next	five	years	in	this	country	.
so	2030	looks	like	an	infinity	away	.	but	we	ca	n't	abandon	it	now	;	we	have	to	push	forward	,	get	fusion	to	happen	.
i	wish	we	had	more	money	,	i	wish	we	had	more	resources	.
but	this	is	what	we	're	aiming	at	,	sometime	in	the	2030s	--	real	electric	power	from	fusion	.	thank	you	very	much	.
