now	this	is	a	very	un	-	ted	-	like	thing	to	do	,	but	let	's	kick	off	the	afternoon	with	a	message	from	a	mystery	sponsor	.
anonymous	:	dear	fox	news	,	it	has	come	to	our	unfortunate	attention	that	both	the	name	and	nature	of	anonymous	has	been	ravaged	.
we	are	everyone	.	we	are	no	one	.
we	are	anonymous	.	we	are	legion	.
we	do	not	forgive	.	we	do	not	forget	.
we	are	but	the	base	of	chaos	.
misha	glenny	:	anonymous	,	ladies	and	gentlemen	--	a	sophisticated	group	of	politically	motivated	hackers	who	have	emerged	in	2011	.
and	they	're	pretty	scary	.
you	never	know	when	they	're	going	to	attack	next	,	who	or	what	the	consequences	will	be	.
but	interestingly	,	they	have	a	sense	of	humor	.
these	guys	hacked	into	fox	news	'	twitter	account	to	announce	president	obama	's	assassination	.
now	you	can	imagine	the	panic	that	would	have	generated	in	the	newsroom	at	fox	.
``	what	do	we	do	now	?
put	on	a	black	armband	,	or	crack	open	the	champagne	?	``
and	of	course	,	who	could	escape	the	irony	of	a	member	of	rupert	murdoch	's	news	corp.	being	a	victim	of	hacking	for	a	change	.
sometimes	you	turn	on	the	news	and	you	say	,	``	is	there	anyone	left	to	hack	?	``
sony	playstation	network	--	done	,	the	government	of	turkey	--	tick	,	britain	's	serious	organized	crime	agency	--	a	breeze	,	the	cia	--	falling	off	a	log	.
in	fact	,	a	friend	of	mine	from	the	security	industry	told	me	the	other	day	that	there	are	two	types	of	companies	in	the	world	:	those	that	know	they	've	been	hacked	,	and	those	that	do	n't	.
i	mean	three	companies	providing	cybersecurity	services	to	the	fbi	have	been	hacked	.
is	nothing	sacred	anymore	,	for	heaven	's	sake	?
anyway	,	this	mysterious	group	anonymous	--	and	they	would	say	this	themselves	--	they	are	providing	a	service	by	demonstrating	how	useless	companies	are	at	protecting	our	data	.
but	there	is	also	a	very	serious	aspect	to	anonymous	--	they	are	ideologically	driven	.
they	claim	that	they	are	battling	a	dastardly	conspiracy	.
they	say	that	governments	are	trying	to	take	over	the	internet	and	control	it	,	and	that	they	,	anonymous	,	are	the	authentic	voice	of	resistance	--	be	it	against	middle	eastern	dictatorships	,	against	global	media	corporations	,	or	against	intelligence	agencies	,	or	whoever	it	is	.
and	their	politics	are	not	entirely	unattractive	.
okay	,	they	're	a	little	inchoate	.
there	's	a	strong	whiff	of	half	-	baked	anarchism	about	them	.
but	one	thing	is	true	:	we	are	at	the	beginning	of	a	mighty	struggle	for	control	of	the	internet	.
the	web	links	everything	,	and	very	soon	it	will	mediate	most	human	activity	.
because	the	internet	has	fashioned	a	new	and	complicated	environment	for	an	old	-	age	dilemma	that	pits	the	demands	of	security	with	the	desire	for	freedom	.
now	this	is	a	very	complicated	struggle	.
and	unfortunately	,	for	mortals	like	you	and	me	,	we	probably	ca	n't	understand	it	very	well	.
nonetheless	,	in	an	unexpected	attack	of	hubris	a	couple	of	years	ago	,	i	decided	i	would	try	and	do	that	.
and	i	sort	of	get	it	.
these	were	the	various	things	that	i	was	looking	at	as	i	was	trying	to	understand	it	.
but	in	order	to	try	and	explain	the	whole	thing	,	i	would	need	another	18	minutes	or	so	to	do	it	,	so	you	're	just	going	to	have	to	take	it	on	trust	from	me	on	this	occasion	,	and	let	me	assure	you	that	all	of	these	issues	are	involved	in	cybersecurity	and	control	of	the	internet	one	way	or	the	other	,	but	in	a	configuration	that	even	stephen	hawking	would	probably	have	difficulty	trying	to	get	his	head	around	.
so	there	you	are	.
and	as	you	see	,	in	the	middle	,	there	is	our	old	friend	,	the	hacker	.
the	hacker	is	absolutely	central	to	many	of	the	political	,	social	and	economic	issues	affecting	the	net	.
and	so	i	thought	to	myself	,	``	well	,	these	are	the	guys	who	i	want	to	talk	to	.	``
and	what	do	you	know	,	nobody	else	does	talk	to	the	hackers	.
they	're	completely	anonymous	,	as	it	were	.
so	despite	the	fact	that	we	are	beginning	to	pour	billions	,	hundreds	of	billions	of	dollars	,	into	cybersecurity	--	for	the	most	extraordinary	technical	solutions	--	no	one	wants	to	talk	to	these	guys	,	the	hackers	,	who	are	doing	everything	.
instead	,	we	prefer	these	really	dazzling	technological	solutions	,	which	cost	a	huge	amount	of	money	.
and	so	nothing	is	going	into	the	hackers	.
well	,	i	say	nothing	,	but	actually	there	is	one	teeny	weeny	little	research	unit	in	turin	,	italy	called	the	hackers	profiling	project	.
and	they	are	doing	some	fantastic	research	into	the	characteristics	,	into	the	abilities	and	the	socialization	of	hackers	.
but	because	they	're	a	u.n.	operation	,	maybe	that	's	why	governments	and	corporations	are	not	that	interested	in	them	.
because	it	's	a	u.n.	operation	,	of	course	,	it	lacks	funding	.
but	i	think	they	're	doing	very	important	work	.
because	where	we	have	a	surplus	of	technology	in	the	cybersecurity	industry	,	we	have	a	definite	lack	of	--	call	me	old	-	fashioned	--	human	intelligence	.
now	,	so	far	i	've	mentioned	the	hackers	anonymous	who	are	a	politically	motivated	hacking	group	.
of	course	,	the	criminal	justice	system	treats	them	as	common	old	garden	criminals	.
but	interestingly	,	anonymous	does	not	make	use	of	its	hacked	information	for	financial	gain	.
but	what	about	the	real	cybercriminals	?
well	real	organized	crime	on	the	internet	goes	back	about	10	years	when	a	group	of	gifted	ukrainian	hackers	developed	a	website	,	which	led	to	the	industrialization	of	cybercrime	.
welcome	to	the	now	forgotten	realm	of	carderplanet	.
this	is	how	they	were	advertising	themselves	a	decade	ago	on	the	net	.
now	carderplanet	was	very	interesting	.
cybercriminals	would	go	there	to	buy	and	sell	stolen	credit	card	details	,	to	exchange	information	about	new	malware	that	was	out	there	.
and	remember	,	this	is	a	time	when	we	're	seeing	for	the	first	time	so	-	called	off	-	the	-	shelf	malware	.
this	is	ready	for	use	,	out	-	of	-	the	-	box	stuff	,	which	you	can	deploy	even	if	you	're	not	a	terribly	sophisticated	hacker	.
and	so	carderplanet	became	a	sort	of	supermarket	for	cybercriminals	.
and	its	creators	were	incredibly	smart	and	entrepreneurial	,	because	they	were	faced	with	one	enormous	challenge	as	cybercriminals	.
and	that	challenge	is	:	how	do	you	do	business	,	how	do	you	trust	somebody	on	the	web	who	you	want	to	do	business	with	when	you	know	that	they	're	a	criminal	?
it	's	axiomatic	that	they	're	dodgy	,	and	they	're	going	to	want	to	try	and	rip	you	off	.
so	the	family	,	as	the	inner	core	of	carderplanet	was	known	,	came	up	with	this	brilliant	idea	called	the	escrow	system	.
they	appointed	an	officer	who	would	mediate	between	the	vendor	and	the	purchaser	.
the	vendor	,	say	,	had	stolen	credit	card	details	;	the	purchaser	wanted	to	get	a	hold	of	them	.
the	purchaser	would	send	the	administrative	officer	some	dollars	digitally	,	and	the	vendor	would	sell	the	stolen	credit	card	details	.
and	the	officer	would	then	verify	if	the	stolen	credit	card	worked	.
and	if	they	did	,	he	then	passed	on	the	money	to	the	vendor	and	the	stolen	credit	card	details	to	the	purchaser	.
and	it	was	this	which	completely	revolutionized	cybercrime	on	the	web	.
and	after	that	,	it	just	went	wild	.
we	had	a	champagne	decade	for	people	who	we	know	as	carders	.
now	i	spoke	to	one	of	these	carders	who	we	'll	call	redbrigade	--	although	that	was	n't	even	his	proper	nickname	--	but	i	promised	i	would	n't	reveal	who	he	was	.
and	he	explained	to	me	how	in	2003	and	2004	he	would	go	on	sprees	in	new	york	,	taking	out	$	10,000	from	an	atm	here	,	$	30,000	from	an	atm	there	,	using	cloned	credit	cards	.
he	was	making	,	on	average	a	week	,	$	150,000	--	tax	free	of	course	.
and	he	said	that	he	had	so	much	money	stashed	in	his	upper	-	east	side	apartment	at	one	point	that	he	just	did	n't	know	what	to	do	with	it	and	actually	fell	into	a	depression	.
but	that	's	a	slightly	different	story	,	which	i	wo	n't	go	into	now	.
now	the	interesting	thing	about	redbrigade	is	that	he	was	n't	an	advanced	hacker	.
he	sort	of	understood	the	technology	,	and	he	realized	that	security	was	very	important	if	you	were	going	to	be	a	carder	,	but	he	did	n't	spend	his	days	and	nights	bent	over	a	computer	,	eating	pizza	,	drinking	coke	and	that	sort	of	thing	.
he	was	out	there	on	the	town	having	a	fab	time	enjoying	the	high	life	.
and	this	is	because	hackers	are	only	one	element	in	a	cybercriminal	enterprise	.
and	often	they	're	the	most	vulnerable	element	of	all	.
and	i	want	to	explain	this	to	you	by	introducing	you	to	six	characters	who	i	met	while	i	was	doing	this	research	.
dimitry	golubov	,	aka	script	--	born	in	odessa	,	ukraine	in	1982	.
now	he	developed	his	social	and	moral	compass	on	the	black	sea	port	during	the	1990s	.
this	was	a	sink	-	or	-	swim	environment	where	involvement	in	criminal	or	corrupt	activities	was	entirely	necessary
if	you	wanted	to	survive	.
as	an	accomplished	computer	user	,	what	dimitry	did	was	to	transfer	the	gangster	capitalism	of	his	hometown	onto	the	worldwide	web	.
and	he	did	a	great	job	in	it	.
you	have	to	understand	though	that	from	his	ninth	birthday	,	the	only	environment	he	knew	was	gangsterism	.
he	knew	no	other	way	of	making	a	living	and	making	money	.
then	we	have	renukanth	subramaniam	,	aka	jilsi	--	founder	of	darkmarket	,	born	in	colombo	,	sri	lanka	.
as	an	eight	year	-	old	,	he	and	his	parents	fled	the	sri	lankan	capital	because	singhalese	mobs	were	roaming	the	city	,	looking	for	tamils	like	renu	to	murder	.
at	11	,	he	was	interrogated	by	the	sri	lankan	military	,	accused	of	being	a	terrorist	,	and	his	parents	sent	him	on	his	own	to	britain	as	a	refugee	seeking	political	asylum	.
at	13	,	with	only	little	english	and	being	bullied	at	school	,	he	escaped	into	a	world	of	computers	where	he	showed	great	technical	ability	,	but	he	was	soon	being	seduced	by	people	on	the	internet	.
he	was	convicted	of	mortgage	and	credit	card	fraud	,	and	he	will	be	released	from	wormwood	scrubs	jail	in	london	in	2012	.
matrix001	,	who	was	an	administrator	at	darkmarket	.
born	in	southern	germany	to	a	stable	and	well	-	respected	middle	class	family	,	his	obsession	with	gaming	as	a	teenager	led	him	to	hacking	.
and	he	was	soon	controlling	huge	servers	around	the	world	where	he	stored	his	games	that	he	had	cracked	and	pirated	.
his	slide	into	criminality	was	incremental	.
and	when	he	finally	woke	up	to	his	situation	and	understood	the	implications	,	he	was	already	in	too	deep	.
max	vision	,	aka	iceman	--	mastermind	of	cardersmarket	.
born	in	meridian	,	idaho	.
max	vision	was	one	of	the	best	penetration	testers	working	out	of	santa	clara	,	california	in	the	late	90s	for	private	companies	and	voluntarily	for	the	fbi	.
now	in	the	late	1990s	,	he	discovered	a	vulnerability	on	all	u.s.	government	networks	,	and	he	went	in	and	patched	it	up	--	because	this	included	nuclear	research	facilities	--	sparing	the	american	government	a	huge	security	embarrassment	.
but	also	,	because	he	was	an	inveterate	hacker	,	he	left	a	tiny	digital	wormhole	through	which	he	alone	could	crawl	.
but	this	was	spotted	by	an	eagle	-	eye	investigator	,	and	he	was	convicted	.
at	his	open	prison	,	he	came	under	the	influence	of	financial	fraudsters	,	and	those	financial	fraudsters	persuaded	him	to	work	for	them	on	his	release	.
and	this	man	with	a	planetary	-	sized	brain	is	now	serving	a	13	-	year	sentence	in	california	.
adewale	taiwo	,	aka	feddybb	--	master	bank	account	cracker	from	abuja	in	nigeria	.
he	set	up	his	prosaically	entitled	newsgroup	,	bankfrauds	@	yahoo.co.uk	before	arriving	in	britain	in	2005	to	take	a	masters	in	chemical	engineering	at	manchester	university	.
he	impressed	in	the	private	sector	,	developing	chemical	applications	for	the	oil	industry	while	simultaneously	running	a	worldwide	bank	and	credit	card	fraud	operation	that	was	worth	millions	until	his	arrest	in	2008	.
and	then	finally	,	cagatay	evyapan	,	aka	cha0	--	one	of	the	most	remarkable	hackers	ever	,	from	ankara	in	turkey	.
he	combined	the	tremendous	skills	of	a	geek	with	the	suave	social	engineering	skills	of	the	master	criminal	.
one	of	the	smartest	people	i	've	ever	met	.
he	also	had	the	most	effective	virtual	private	network	security	arrangement	the	police	have	ever	encountered	amongst	global	cybercriminals	.
now	the	important	thing	about	all	of	these	people	is	they	share	certain	characteristics	despite	the	fact	that	they	come	from	very	different	environments	.
they	are	all	people	who	learned	their	hacking	skills	in	their	early	to	mid	-	teens	.
they	are	all	people	who	demonstrate	advanced	ability	in	maths	and	the	sciences	.
remember	that	,	when	they	developed	those	hacking	skills	,	their	moral	compass	had	not	yet	developed	.
and	most	of	them	,	with	the	exception	of	script	and	cha0	,	they	did	not	demonstrate	any	real	social	skills	in	the	outside	world	--	only	on	the	web	.
and	the	other	thing	is	the	high	incidence	of	hackers	like	these	who	have	characteristics	which	are	consistent	with	asperger	's	syndrome	.
now	i	discussed	this	with	professor	simon	baron	-	cohen	who	's	the	professor	of	developmental	psychopathology	at	cambridge	.
and	he	has	done	path	-	breaking	work	on	autism	and	confirmed	,	also	for	the	authorities	here	,	that	gary	mckinnon	--	who	is	wanted	by	the	united	states	for	hacking	into	the	pentagon	--	suffers	from	asperger	's	and	a	secondary	condition	of	depression	.
and	baron	-	cohen	explained	that	certain	disabilities	can	manifest	themselves	in	the	hacking	and	computing	world	as	tremendous	skills	,	and	that	we	should	not	be	throwing	in	jail	people	who	have	such	disabilities	and	skills	because	they	have	lost	their	way	socially	or	been	duped	.
now	i	think	we	're	missing	a	trick	here	,	because	i	do	n't	think	people	like	max	vision	should	be	in	jail	.
and	let	me	be	blunt	about	this	.
in	china	,	in	russia	and	in	loads	of	other	countries	that	are	developing	cyber	-	offensive	capabilities	,	this	is	exactly	what	they	are	doing	.
they	are	recruiting	hackers	both	before	and	after	they	become	involved	in	criminal	and	industrial	espionage	activities	--	are	mobilizing	them	on	behalf	of	the	state	.
we	need	to	engage	and	find	ways	of	offering	guidance	to	these	young	people	,
because	they	are	a	remarkable	breed	.
and	if	we	rely	,	as	we	do	at	the	moment	,	solely	on	the	criminal	justice	system	and	the	threat	of	punitive	sentences	,	we	will	be	nurturing	a	monster	we	can	not	tame	.
thank	you	very	much	for	listening	.
chris	anderson	:	so	your	idea	worth	spreading	is	hire	hackers	.
how	would	someone	get	over	that	kind	of	fear	that	the	hacker	they	hire	might	preserve	that	little	teensy	wormhole	?
mg	:	i	think	to	an	extent	,	you	have	to	understand	that	it	's	axiomatic	among	hackers	that	they	do	that	.
they	're	just	relentless	and	obsessive	about	what	they	do	.
but	all	of	the	people	who	i	've	spoken	to	who	have	fallen	foul	of	the	law	,	they	have	all	said	,	``	please	,	please	give	us	a	chance	to	work	in	the	legitimate	industry	.
we	just	never	knew	how	to	get	there	,	what	we	were	doing	.
we	want	to	work	with	you	.	``
