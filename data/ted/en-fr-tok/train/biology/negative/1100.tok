if	i	should	have	a	daughter	,	instead	of	``	mom	,	``	she	's	gon	na	call	me	``	point	b	,	``	because	that	way	she	knows	that	no	matter	what	happens	,	at	least	she	can	always	find	her	way	to	me	.
and	i	'm	going	to	paint	solar	systems	on	the	backs	of	her	hands	so	she	has	to	learn	the	entire	universe	before	she	can	say	,	``	oh	,	i	know	that	like	the	back	of	my	hand	.	``
and	she	's	going	to	learn	that	this	life	will	hit	you	hard	in	the	face	,	wait	for	you	to	get	back	up	just	so	it	can	kick	you	in	the	stomach	.
but	getting	the	wind	knocked	out	of	you	is	the	only	way	to	remind	your	lungs	how	much	they	like	the	taste	of	air	.
there	is	hurt	,	here	,	that	can	not	be	fixed	by	band	-	aids	or	poetry	.
so	the	first	time	she	realizes	that	wonder	woman	is	n't	coming	,	i	'll	make	sure	she	knows	she	does	n't	have	to	wear	the	cape	all	by	herself
because	no	matter	how	wide	you	stretch	your	fingers	,	your	hands	will	always	be	too	small	to	catch	all	the	pain	you	want	to	heal	.
believe	me	,	i	've	tried	.
``	and	,	baby	,	``	i	'll	tell	her	,	do	n't	keep	your	nose	up	in	the	air	like	that	.	i	know	that	trick	;	i	've	done	it	a	million	times	.
you	're	just	smelling	for	smoke	so	you	can	follow	the	trail	back	to	a	burning	house	,	so	you	can	find	the	boy	who	lost	everything	in	the	fire	to	see	if	you	can	save	him	.
or	else	find	the	boy	who	lit	the	fire	in	the	first	place	,	to	see	if	you	can	change	him	.	``
but	i	know	she	will	anyway	,	so	instead	i	'll	always	keep	an	extra	supply	of	chocolate	and	rain	boots	nearby	,	because	there	is	no	heartbreak	that	chocolate	ca	n't	fix	.
okay	,	there	's	a	few	heartbreaks	that	chocolate	ca	n't	fix	.
but	that	's	what	the	rain	boots	are	for	,
because	rain	will	wash	away	everything	,	if	you	let	it	.
i	want	her	to	look	at	the	world	through	the	underside	of	a	glass	-	bottom	boat	,	to	look	through	a	microscope	at	the	galaxies	that	exist	on	the	pinpoint	of	a	human	mind	,	because	that	's	the	way	my	mom	taught	me	.
that	there	'll	be	days	like	this	.
♫	there	'll	be	days	like	this	,	my	momma	said	.	♫	when	you	open	your	hands	to	catch	and	wind	up	with	only	blisters	and	bruises	;	when	you	step	out	of	the	phone	booth	and	try	to	fly	and	the	very	people	you	want	to	save	are	the	ones	standing	on	your	cape	;	when	your	boots	will	fill	with	rain	,	and	you	'll	be	up	to	your	knees	in	disappointment	.
and	those	are	the	very	days	you	have	all	the	more	reason	to	say	thank	you	.
because	there	's	nothing	more	beautiful	than	the	way	the	ocean	refuses	to	stop	kissing	the	shoreline	,	no	matter	how	many	times	it	's	sent	away	.
you	will	put	the	wind	in	winsome	,	lose	some	.
you	will	put	the	star	in	starting	over	,	and	over	.
and	no	matter	how	many	land	mines	erupt	in	a	minute	,	be	sure	your	mind	lands	on	the	beauty	of	this	funny	place	called	life	.
and	yes	,	on	a	scale	from	one	to	over	-	trusting	,	i	am	pretty	damn	naive	.
but	i	want	her	to	know	that	this	world	is	made	out	of	sugar	.
it	can	crumble	so	easily	,	but	do	n't	be	afraid	to	stick	your	tongue	out	and	taste	it	.
``	baby	,	``	i	'll	tell	her	,	``	remember	,	your	momma	is	a	worrier	,	and	your	poppa	is	a	warrior	,	and	you	are	the	girl	with	small	hands	and	big	eyes	who	never	stops	asking	for	more	.	``
remember	that	good	things	come	in	threes	and	so	do	bad	things	.
and	always	apologize	when	you	've	done	something	wrong	,
but	do	n't	you	ever	apologize	for	the	way	your	eyes	refuse	to	stop	shining	.
your	voice	is	small	,	but	do	n't	ever	stop	singing	.
and	when	they	finally	hand	you	heartache	,	when	they	slip	war	and	hatred	under	your	door	and	offer	you	handouts	on	street	-	corners	of	cynicism	and	defeat	,	you	tell	them	that	they	really	ought	to	meet	your	mother	.
thank	you	.	thank	you	.
thank	you	.
thanks	.
thank	you	.
all	right	,	so	i	want	you	to	take	a	moment	,	and	i	want	you	to	think	of	three	things	that	you	know	to	be	true	.
they	can	be	about	whatever	you	want	--	technology	,	entertainment	,	design	,	your	family	,	what	you	had	for	breakfast	.
the	only	rule	is	do	n't	think	too	hard	.
okay	,	ready	?	go	.
okay	.
so	here	are	three	things	i	know	to	be	true	.
i	know	that	jean	-	luc	godard	was	right	when	he	said	that	,	``	a	good	story	has	a	beginning	,	a	middle	and	an	end	,	although	not	necessarily	in	that	order	.	``
i	know	that	i	'm	incredibly	nervous	and	excited	to	be	up	here	,	which	is	greatly	inhibiting	my	ability	to	keep	it	cool	.
and	i	know	that	i	have	been	waiting	all	week	to	tell	this	joke	.
why	was	the	scarecrow	invited	to	ted	?
because	he	was	out	standing	in	his	field	.
i	'm	sorry	.
okay	,	so	these	are	three	things	i	know	to	be	true	.
but	there	are	plenty	of	things	i	have	trouble	understanding	.
so	i	write	poems	to	figure	things	out	.
sometimes	the	only	way	i	know	how	to	work	through	something	is	by	writing	a	poem	.
and	sometimes	i	get	to	the	end	of	the	poem	and	look	back	and	go	,	``	oh	,	that	's	what	this	is	all	about	,	``
and	sometimes	i	get	to	the	end	of	the	poem	and	have	n't	solved	anything	,	but	at	least	i	have	a	new	poem	out	of	it	.
spoken	word	poetry	is	the	art	of	performance	poetry	.
i	tell	people	it	involves	creating	poetry	that	does	n't	just	want	to	sit	on	paper	,	that	something	about	it	demands	it	be	heard	out	loud	or	witnessed	in	person	.
when	i	was	a	freshman	in	high	school	,	i	was	a	live	wire	of	nervous	hormones	.
and	i	was	underdeveloped	and	over	-	excitable	.
and	despite	my	fear	of	ever	being	looked	at	for	too	long	,	i	was	fascinated	by	the	idea	of	spoken	word	poetry	.
i	felt	that	my	two	secret	loves	,	poetry	and	theatre	,	had	come	together	,	had	a	baby	,	a	baby	i	needed	to	get	to	know	.
so	i	decided	to	give	it	a	try	.
my	first	spoken	word	poem	,	packed	with	all	the	wisdom	of	a	14	-	year	-	old	,	was	about	the	injustice	of	being	seen	as	unfeminine	.
the	poem	was	very	indignant	,	and	mainly	exaggerated	,	but	the	only	spoken	word	poetry	that	i	had	seen	up	until	that	point	was	mainly	indignant	,	so	i	thought	that	that	's	what	was	expected	of	me	.
the	first	time	that	i	performed	,	the	audience	of	teenagers	hooted	and	hollered	their	sympathy	,	and	when	i	came	off	the	stage	i	was	shaking	.
i	felt	this	tap	on	my	shoulder	,	and	i	turned	around	to	see	this	giant	girl	in	a	hoodie	sweatshirt	emerge	from	the	crowd	.
she	was	maybe	eight	feet	tall	and	looked	like	she	could	beat	me	up	with	one	hand	,	but	instead	she	just	nodded	at	me	and	said	,	``	hey	,	i	really	felt	that	.	thanks	.	``
and	lightning	struck	.
i	was	hooked	.
i	discovered	this	bar	on	manhattan	's	lower	east	side	that	hosted	a	weekly	poetry	open	mic	,	and	my	bewildered	,	but	supportive	,	parents	took	me	to	soak	in	every	ounce	of	spoken	word	that	i	could	.
i	was	the	youngest	by	at	least	a	decade	,	but	somehow	the	poets	at	the	bowery	poetry	club	did	n't	seem	bothered	by	the	14	-	year	-	old	wandering	about	--	if	fact	,	they	welcomed	me	.
and	it	was	here	,	listening	to	these	poets	share	their	stories	,	that	i	learned	that	spoken	word	poetry	did	n't	have	to	be	indignant	,	it	could	be	fun	or	painful	or	serious	or	silly	.
the	bowery	poetry	club	became	my	classroom	and	my	home	,
and	the	poets	who	performed	encouraged	me	to	share	my	stories	as	well	.
never	mind	the	fact	that	i	was	14	--	they	told	me	,	``	write	about	being	14.	``
so	i	did	and	stood	amazed	every	week	when	these	brilliant	,	grown	-	up	poets	laughed	with	me	and	groaned	their	sympathy	and	clapped	and	told	me	,	``	hey	,	i	really	felt	that	too	.	``
now	i	can	divide	my	spoken	word	journey	into	three	steps	.
step	one	was	the	moment	i	said	,	``	i	can	.	i	can	do	this	.	``
and	that	was	thanks	to	a	girl	in	a	hoodie	.
step	two	was	the	moment	i	said	,	``	i	will	.	i	will	continue	.
i	love	spoken	word	.	i	will	keep	coming	back	week	after	week	.	``
and	step	three	began	when	i	realized	that	i	did	n't	have	to	write	poems	that	were	indignant	,	if	that	's	not	what	i	was	.
there	were	things	that	were	specific	to	me	,	and	the	more	that	i	focused	on	those	things	,	the	weirder	my	poetry	got	,	but	the	more	that	it	felt	like	mine	.
it	's	not	just	the	adage	``	write	what	you	know	.	``	it	's	about	gathering	up	all	of	the	knowledge	and	experience	you	've	collected	up	to	now	to	help	you	dive	into	the	things	you	do	n't	know	.
i	use	poetry	to	help	me	work	through	what	i	do	n't	understand	,	but	i	show	up	to	each	new	poem	with	a	backpack	full	of	everywhere	else	that	i	've	been	.
when	i	got	to	university	,	i	met	a	fellow	poet	who	shared	my	belief	in	the	magic	of	spoken	word	poetry	.
and	actually	,	phil	kaye	and	i	coincidentally	also	share	the	same	last	name	.
when	i	was	in	high	school	i	had	created	project	v.o.i.c.e	.
as	a	way	to	encourage	my	friends	to	do	spoken	word	with	me	.
but	phil	and	i	decided	to	reinvent	project	v.o.i.c.e	.	--	this	time	changing	the	mission	to	using	spoken	word	poetry	as	a	way	to	entertain	,	educate	and	inspire	.
we	stayed	full	-	time	students	,	but	in	between	we	traveled	,	performing	and	teaching	nine	-	year	-	olds	to	mfa	candidates	,	from	california	to	indiana	to	india	to	a	public	high	school	just	up	the	street	from	campus	.
and	we	saw	over	and	over	the	way	that	spoken	word	poetry	cracks	open	locks	.
but	it	turns	out	sometimes	,	poetry	can	be	really	scary	.
turns	out	sometimes	,	you	have	to	trick	teenagers	into	writing	poetry	.
so	i	came	up	with	lists	.	everyone	can	write	lists	.
and	the	first	list	that	i	assign	is	``	10	things	i	know	to	be	true	.	``
and	here	's	what	happens	,	and	here	's	what	you	would	discover	too	if	we	all	started	sharing	our	lists	out	loud	.
at	a	certain	point	,	you	would	realize	that	someone	has	the	exact	same	thing	,	or	one	thing	very	similar	,	to	something	on	your	list	.
and	then	someone	else	has	something	the	complete	opposite	of	yours	.
third	,	someone	has	something	you	've	never	even	heard	of	before	.
and	fourth	,	someone	has	something	you	thought	you	knew	everything	about	,	but	they	're	introducing	a	new	angle	of	looking	at	it	.
and	i	tell	people	that	this	is	where	great	stories	start	from	--	these	four	intersections	of	what	you	're	passionate	about	and	what	others	might	be	invested	in	.
and	most	people	respond	really	well	to	this	exercise	.
but	one	of	my	students	,	a	freshman	named	charlotte	,	was	not	convinced	.
charlotte	was	very	good	at	writing	lists	,	but	she	refused	to	write	any	poems	.
``	miss	,	``	she	'd	say	,	``	i	'm	just	not	interesting	.
i	do	n't	have	anything	interesting	to	say	.	``
so	i	assigned	her	list	after	list	,	and	one	day	i	assigned	the	list	``	10	things	i	should	have	learned	by	now	.	``
number	three	on	charlotte	's	list	was	,	``	i	should	have	learned	not	to	crush	on	guys	three	times	my	age	.	``
i	asked	her	what	that	meant	,	and	she	said	,	``	miss	,	it	's	kind	of	a	long	story	.	``
and	i	said	,	``	charlotte	,	it	sounds	pretty	interesting	to	me	.	``
and	so	she	wrote	her	first	poem	,	a	love	poem	unlike	any	i	had	ever	heard	before	.
and	the	poem	began	,	``	anderson	cooper	is	a	gorgeous	man	.	``
``	did	you	see	him	on	60	minutes	,	racing	michael	phelps	in	a	pool	--	nothing	but	swim	trunks	on	--	diving	in	the	water	,	determined	to	beat	this	swimming	champion	?
after	the	race	,	he	tossed	his	wet	,	cloud	-	white	hair	and	said	,	'	you	're	a	god	.	'	no	,	anderson	,	you	're	the	god	.	``
now	i	know	that	the	number	one	rule	to	being	cool	is	to	seem	unfazed	,	to	never	admit	that	anything	scares	you	or	impresses	you	or	excites	you	.
somebody	once	told	me	it	's	like	walking	through	life	like	this	.
you	protect	yourself	from	all	the	unexpected	miseries	or	hurt	that	might	show	up	.
but	i	try	to	walk	through	life	like	this	.
and	yes	,	that	means	catching	all	of	those	miseries	and	hurt	,	but	it	also	means	that	when	beautiful	,	amazing	things	just	fall	out	of	the	sky	,	i	'm	ready	to	catch	them	.
i	use	spoken	word	to	help	my	students	rediscover	wonder	,	to	fight	their	instincts	to	be	cool	and	unfazed	and	,	instead	,	actively	pursue	being	engaged	with	what	goes	on	around	them	,	so	that	they	can	reinterpret	and	create	something	from	it	.
it	's	not	that	i	think	that	spoken	word	poetry	is	the	ideal	art	form	.
i	'm	always	trying	to	find	the	best	way	to	tell	each	story	.
i	write	musicals	;	i	make	short	films	alongside	my	poems	.
but	i	teach	spoken	word	poetry	because	it	's	accessible	.
not	everyone	can	read	music	or	owns	a	camera	,	but	everyone	can	communicate	in	some	way	,	and	everyone	has	stories	that	the	rest	of	us	can	learn	from	.
plus	,	spoken	word	poetry	allows	for	immediate	connections	.
it	's	not	uncommon	for	people	to	feel	like	they	're	alone	or	that	nobody	understands	them	,	but	spoken	word	teaches	that	if	you	have	the	ability	to	express	yourself	and	the	courage	to	present	those	stories	and	opinions	,	you	could	be	rewarded	with	a	room	full	of	your	peers	,	or	your	community	,	who	will	listen	.
and	maybe	even	a	giant	girl	in	a	hoodie	will	connect	with	what	you	've	shared	.
and	that	is	an	amazing	realization	to	have	,	especially	when	you	're	14	.
plus	,	now	with	youtube	,	that	connection	's	not	even	limited	to	the	room	we	're	in	.
i	'm	so	lucky	that	there	's	this	archive	of	performances	that	i	can	share	with	my	students	.
it	allows	for	even	more	opportunities	for	them	to	find	a	poet	or	a	poem	that	they	connect	to	.
it	is	tempting	--	once	you	've	figured	this	out	--	it	is	tempting	to	keep	writing	the	same	poem	,	or	keep	telling	the	same	story	,	over	and	over	,	once	you	've	figured	out	that	it	will	gain	you	applause	.
it	's	not	enough	to	just	teach	that	you	can	express	yourself	.	you	have	to	grow	and	explore	and	take	risks	and	challenge	yourself	.
and	that	is	step	three	:	infusing	the	work	you	're	doing	with	the	specific	things	that	make	you	you	,	even	while	those	things	are	always	changing	.
because	step	three	never	ends	.
but	you	do	n't	get	to	start	on	step	three	,	until	you	take	step	one	first	:	i	can	.
i	travel	a	lot	while	i	'm	teaching	,	and	i	do	n't	always	get	to	watch	all	of	my	students	reach	their	step	three	,	but	i	was	very	lucky	with	charlotte	,	that	i	got	to	watch	her	journey	unfold	the	way	it	did	.
i	watched	her	realize	that	,	by	putting	the	things	that	she	knows	to	be	true	into	the	work	she	's	doing	,	she	can	create	poems	that	only	charlotte	can	write	--	about	eyeballs	and	elevators	and	dora	the	explorer	.
and	i	'm	trying	to	tell	stories	only	i	can	tell	--	like	this	story	.
i	spent	a	lot	of	time	thinking	about	the	best	way	to	tell	this	story	,	and	i	wondered	if	the	best	way	was	going	to	be	a	powerpoint	or	a	short	film	--	and	where	exactly	was	the	beginning	or	the	middle	or	the	end	?
and	i	wondered	whether	i	'd	get	to	the	end	of	this	talk	and	finally	have	figured	it	all	out	,	or	not	.
and	i	always	thought	that	my	beginning	was	at	the	bowery	poetry	club	,	but	it	's	possible	that	it	was	much	earlier	.
in	preparing	for	ted	,	i	discovered	this	diary	page	in	an	old	journal	.
i	think	december	54th	was	probably	supposed	to	be	24th	.
it	's	clear	that	when	i	was	a	child	,	i	definitely	walked	through	life	like	this	.
i	think	that	we	all	did	.
i	would	like	to	help	others	rediscover	that	wonder	--	to	want	to	engage	with	it	,	to	want	to	learn	,	to	want	to	share	what	they	've	learned	,	what	they	've	figured	out	to	be	true	and	what	they	're	still	figuring	out	.
so	i	'd	like	to	close	with	this	poem	.
when	they	bombed	hiroshima	,	the	explosion	formed	a	mini	-	supernova	so	every	living	animal	,	human	or	plant	that	received	direct	contact	with	the	rays	from	that	sun	was	instantly	turned	to	ash	.
and	what	was	left	of	the	city	soon	followed	.
the	long	-	lasting	damage	of	nuclear	radiation	caused	an	entire	city	and	its	population	to	turn	into	powder	.
when	i	was	born	,	my	mom	says	i	looked	around	the	whole	hospital	room	with	a	stare	that	said	,	``	this	?	i	've	done	this	before	.	``
she	says	i	have	old	eyes	.
when	my	grandpa	genji	died	,	i	was	only	five	years	old	,	but	i	took	my	mom	by	the	hand	and	told	her	,	``	do	n't	worry	,	he	'll	come	back	as	a	baby	.	``
and	yet	,	for	someone	who	's	apparently	done	this	already	,	i	still	have	n't	figured	anything	out	yet	.
my	knees	still	buckle	every	time	i	get	on	a	stage	.
my	self	-	confidence	can	be	measured	out	in	teaspoons	mixed	into	my	poetry	,	and	it	still	always	tastes	funny	in	my	mouth	.
but	in	hiroshima	,	some	people	were	wiped	clean	away	,	leaving	only	a	wristwatch	or	a	diary	page	.
so	no	matter	that	i	have	inhibitions	to	fill	all	my	pockets	,
i	keep	trying	,	hoping	that	one	day	i	'll	write	a	poem	i	can	be	proud	to	let	sit	in	a	museum	exhibit	as	the	only	proof	i	existed	.
my	parents	named	me	sarah	,	which	is	a	biblical	name	.
in	the	original	story	,	god	told	sarah	she	could	do	something	impossible	and	she	laughed	,	because	the	first	sarah	,	she	did	n't	know	what	to	do	with	impossible	.
and	me	?	well	,	neither	do	i	,	but	i	see	the	impossible	every	day	.
impossible	is	trying	to	connect	in	this	world	,	trying	to	hold	onto	others	while	things	are	blowing	up	around	you	,	knowing	that	while	you	're	speaking	,	they	are	n't	just	waiting	for	their	turn	to	talk	--	they	hear	you	.
they	feel	exactly	what	you	feel	at	the	same	time	that	you	feel	it	.
it	's	what	i	strive	for	every	time	i	open	my	mouth	--	that	impossible	connection	.
there	's	this	piece	of	wall	in	hiroshima	that	was	completely	burnt	black	by	the	radiation	.
but	on	the	front	step	,	a	person	who	was	sitting	there	blocked	the	rays	from	hitting	the	stone	.
the	only	thing	left	now	is	a	permanent	shadow	of	positive	light	.
after	the	a	-	bomb	,	specialists	said	it	would	take	75	years	for	the	radiation	-	damaged	soil	of	hiroshima	city	to	ever	grow	anything	again	.
but	that	spring	,	there	were	new	buds	popping	up	from	the	earth	.
when	i	meet	you	,	in	that	moment	,	i	'm	no	longer	a	part	of	your	future	.
i	start	quickly	becoming	part	of	your	past	.
but	in	that	instant	,	i	get	to	share	your	present	.
and	you	,	you	get	to	share	mine	.
and	that	is	the	greatest	present	of	all	.
so	if	you	tell	me	i	can	do	the	impossible	,	i	'll	probably	laugh	at	you	.
i	do	n't	know	if	i	can	change	the	world	yet	,	because	i	do	n't	know	that	much	about	it	--	and	i	do	n't	know	that	much	about	reincarnation	either	,	but	if	you	make	me	laugh	hard	enough	,	sometimes	i	forget	what	century	i	'm	in	.
this	is	n't	my	first	time	here	.	this	is	n't	my	last	time	here	.
these	are	n't	the	last	words	i	'll	share	.
but	just	in	case	,	i	'm	trying	my	hardest	to	get	it	right	this	time	around	.
thank	you	.
thank	you	.
thank	you	.
