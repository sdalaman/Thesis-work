i	'll	just	start	talking	about	the	17th	century	.
i	hope	nobody	finds	that	offensive	.
i	--	you	know	,	when	i	--	after	i	had	invented	pcr	,	i	kind	of	needed	a	change	.
and	i	moved	down	to	la	jolla	and	learned	how	to	surf	.
and	i	started	living	down	there	on	the	beach	for	a	long	time	.
and	when	surfers	are	out	waiting	for	waves	,	you	probably	wonder	,	if	you	've	never	been	out	there	,	what	are	they	doing	?
you	know	,	sometimes	there	's	a	10-	,	15	-	minute	break	out	there	when	you	're	waiting	for	a	wave	to	come	in	.
they	usually	talk	about	the	17th	century	.
you	know	,	they	get	a	real	bad	rap	in	the	world	.
people	think	they	're	sort	of	lowbrows	.
one	day	,	somebody	suggested	i	read	this	book	.
it	was	called	--	it	was	called	``	the	air	pump	,	``	or	something	like	``	the	leviathan	and	the	air	pump	.	``
it	was	a	real	weird	book	about	the	17th	century	.
and	i	realized	,	the	roots	of	the	way	i	sort	of	thought	was	just	the	only	natural	way	to	think	about	things	.
that	--	you	know	,	i	was	born	thinking	about	things	that	way	,	and	i	had	always	been	like	a	little	scientist	guy	.
and	when	i	went	to	find	out	something	,	i	used	scientific	methods	.	i	was	n't	real	surprised	,	you	know	,	when	they	first	told	me	how	--	how	you	were	supposed	to	do	science	,	because	i	'd	already	been	doing	it	for	fun	and	whatever	.
but	it	did	n't	--	it	never	occurred	to	me	that	it	had	to	be	invented	and	that	it	had	been	invented	only	350	years	ago	.
you	know	,	it	was	--	like	it	happened	in	england	,	and	germany	,	and	italy	sort	of	all	at	the	same	time	.
and	the	story	of	that	,	i	thought	,	was	really	fascinating	.
so	i	'm	going	to	talk	a	little	bit	about	that	,	and	what	exactly	is	it	that	scientists	are	supposed	to	do	.
and	it	's	,	it	's	a	kind	of	--	you	know	,	charles	i	got	beheaded	somewhere	early	in	the	17th	century	.
and	the	english	set	up	cromwell	and	a	whole	bunch	of	republicans	or	whatever	,	and	not	the	kind	of	republicans	we	had	.
they	changed	the	government	,	and	it	did	n't	work	.
and	charles	ii	,	the	son	,	was	finally	put	back	on	the	throne	of	england	.
he	was	really	nervous	,	because	his	dad	had	been	,	you	know	,	beheaded	for	being	the	king	of	england	and	he	was	nervous	about	the	fact	that	conversations	that	got	going	in	,	like	,	bars	and	stuff	would	turn	to	--	this	is	kind	of	--	it	's	hard	to	believe	,	but	people	in	the	17th	century	in	england	were	starting	to	talk	about	,	you	know	,	philosophy	and	stuff	in	bars	.
they	did	n't	have	tv	screens	,	and	they	did	n't	have	any	football	games	to	watch	.
and	they	would	get	really	pissy	,	and	all	of	a	sudden	people	would	spill	out	into	the	street	and	fight	about	issues	like	whether	or	not	it	was	okay	if	robert	boyle	made	a	device	called	the	vacuum	pump	.
now	,	boyle	was	a	friend	of	charles	ii	.	he	was	a	christian	guy	during	the	weekends	,	but	during	the	week	he	was	a	scientist	.
which	was	--	back	then	it	was	sort	of	,	you	know	,	well	,	you	know	--	if	you	made	this	thing	--	he	made	this	little	device	,	like	kind	of	like	a	bicycle	pump	in	reverse	that	could	suck	all	the	air	out	of	--	you	know	what	a	bell	jar	is	?	one	of	these	things	,	you	pick	it	up	,	put	it	down	,	and	it	's	got	a	seal	,	and	you	can	see	inside	of	it	,	so	you	can	see	what	's	going	on	inside	this	thing	.
but	what	he	was	trying	to	do	was	to	pump	all	the	air	out	of	there	,	and	see	what	would	happen	inside	there	.
i	mean	,	the	first	--	i	think	one	of	the	first	experiments	he	did	was	he	put	a	bird	in	there	.
and	people	in	the	17th	century	,	they	did	n't	really	understand	the	same	way	we	do	about	you	know	,	this	stuff	is	a	bunch	of	different	kinds	of	molecules	,	and	we	breathe	it	in	for	a	purpose	and	all	that	.
i	mean	,	fish	do	n't	know	much	about	water	,	and	people	did	n't	know	much	about	air	.
but	both	started	exploring	it	.
one	thing	,	he	put	a	bird	in	there	,	and	he	pumped	all	the	air	out	,	and	the	bird	died	.	so	he	said	,	hmm	...
he	said	--	he	called	what	he	'd	done	as	making	--	they	did	n't	call	it	a	vacuum	pump	at	the	time	.
now	you	call	it	a	vacuum	pump	;	he	called	it	a	vacuum	.
right	?	and	immediately	,	he	got	into	trouble	with	the	local	clergy	who	said	,	you	ca	n't	make	a	vacuum	.
ah	,	uh	--	aristotle	said	that	nature	abhors	one	.
i	think	it	was	a	poor	translation	,	probably	,	but	people	relied	on	authorities	like	that	.
and	you	know	,	boyle	says	,	well	,	shit	.
i	make	them	all	the	time	.
i	mean	,	whatever	that	is	that	kills	the	bird	--	and	i	'm	calling	it	a	vacuum	.
and	the	religious	people	said	that	if	god	wanted	you	to	make	--	i	mean	,	god	is	everywhere	,	that	was	one	of	their	rules	,	is	god	is	everywhere	.
and	a	vacuum	--	there	's	nothing	in	a	vacuum	,	so	you	've	--	god	could	n't	be	in	there	.
so	therefore	the	church	said	that	you	ca	n't	make	a	vacuum	,	you	know	.
and	boyle	said	,	bullshit	.
i	mean	,	you	want	to	call	it	godless	,	you	know	,	you	call	it	godless	.
but	that	's	not	my	job	.	i	'm	not	into	that	.
i	do	that	on	the	weekend	.	and	like	--	what	i	'm	trying	to	do	is	figure	out	what	happens	when	you	suck	everything	out	of	a	compartment	.
and	he	did	all	these	cute	little	experiments	.
like	he	did	one	with	--	he	had	a	little	wheel	,	like	a	fan	,	that	was	sort	of	loosely	attached	,	so	it	could	spin	by	itself	.
he	had	another	fan	opposed	to	it	that	he	had	like	a	--	i	mean	,	the	way	i	would	have	done	this	would	be	,	like	,	a	rubber	band	,	and	,	you	know	,	around	a	tinker	toy	kind	of	fan	.
i	know	exactly	how	he	did	it	;	i	've	seen	the	drawings	.
it	's	two	fans	,	one	which	he	could	turn	from	outside	after	he	got	the	vacuum	established	,	and	he	discovered	that	if	he	pulled	all	the	air	out	of	it	,	the	one	fan	would	no	longer	turn	the	other	one	,	right	?
something	was	missing	,	you	know	.	i	mean	,	these	are	--	it	's	kind	of	weird	to	think	that	someone	had	to	do	an	experiment	to	show	that	,	but	that	was	what	was	going	on	at	the	time	.
and	like	,	there	was	big	arguments	about	it	in	the	--	you	know	,	the	gin	houses	and	in	the	coffee	shops	and	stuff	.
and	charles	started	not	liking	that	.
charles	ii	was	kind	of	saying	,	you	know	,	you	should	keep	that	--	let	's	make	a	place	where	you	can	do	this	stuff	where	people	do	n't	get	so	--	you	know	,	we	do	n't	want	the	--	we	do	n't	want	to	get	the	people	mad	at	me	again	.	and	so	--	because	when	they	started	talking	about	religion	and	science	and	stuff	like	that	,	that	's	when	it	had	sort	of	gotten	his	father	in	trouble	.
and	so	,	charles	said	,	i	'm	going	to	put	up	the	money	give	you	guys	a	building	,	come	here	and	you	can	meet	in	the	building	,	but	just	do	n't	talk	about	religion	in	there	.
and	that	was	fine	with	boyle	.
he	said	,	ok	,	we	're	going	to	start	having	these	meetings	.
and	anybody	who	wants	to	do	science	is	--	this	is	about	the	time	that	isaac	newton	was	starting	to	whip	out	a	lot	of	really	interesting	things	.
and	there	was	all	kind	of	people	that	would	come	to	the	royal	society	,	they	called	it	.	you	had	to	be	dressed	up	pretty	well	.
it	was	n't	like	a	ted	conference	.
that	was	the	only	criteria	,	was	that	you	be	--	you	looked	like	a	gentleman	,	and	they	'd	let	anybody	could	come	.
you	did	n't	have	to	be	a	member	then	.
and	so	,	they	would	come	in	and	you	would	do	--	anybody	that	was	going	to	show	an	experiment	,	which	was	kind	of	a	new	word	at	the	time	,	demonstrate	some	principle	,	they	had	to	do	it	on	stage	,	where	everybody	could	see	it	.
so	they	were	--	the	really	important	part	of	this	was	,	you	were	not	supposed	to	talk	about	final	causes	,	for	instance	.
and	god	was	out	of	the	picture	.
the	actual	nature	of	reality	was	not	at	issue	.
you	're	not	supposed	to	talk	about	the	absolute	nature	of	anything	.
you	were	not	supposed	to	talk	about	anything	that	you	could	n't	demonstrate	.
so	if	somebody	could	see	it	,	you	could	say	,	here	's	how	the	machine	works	,	here	's	what	we	do	,	and	then	here	's	what	happens	.
and	seeing	what	happens	,	it	was	ok	to	generalize	,	and	say	,	i	'm	sure	that	this	will	happen	anytime	we	make	one	of	these	things	.
and	so	you	can	start	making	up	some	rules	.
you	say	,	anytime	you	have	a	vacuum	state	,	you	will	discover	that	one	wheel	will	not	turn	another	one	,	if	the	only	connection	between	them	is	whatever	was	there	before	the	vacuum	.	that	kind	of	thing	.
candles	ca	n't	burn	in	a	vacuum	,	therefore	,	probably	sparklers	would	n't	either	.
it	's	not	clear	;	actually	sparklers	will	,	but	they	did	n't	know	that	.	they	did	n't	have	sparklers	.	but	,	they	--	--	you	can	make	up	rules	,	but	they	have	to	relate	only	to	the	things	that	you	've	been	able	to	demonstrate	.
and	most	the	demonstrations	had	to	do	with	visuals	.	like	if	you	do	an	experiment	on	stage	,	and	nobody	can	see	it	,	they	can	just	hear	it	,	they	would	probably	think	you	were	freaky	.
i	mean	,	reality	is	what	you	can	see	.
that	was	n't	an	explicit	rule	in	the	meeting	,	but	i	'm	sure	that	was	part	of	it	,	you	know	.	if	people	hear	voices	,	and	they	ca	n't	see	and	associate	it	with	somebody	,	that	person	's	probably	not	there	.
but	the	general	idea	that	you	could	only	--	you	could	only	really	talk	about	things	in	that	place	that	had	some	kind	of	experimental	basis	.
it	did	n't	matter	what	thomas	hobbes	,	who	was	a	local	philosopher	,	said	about	it	,	you	know	,	because	you	were	n't	going	to	be	talking	final	causes	.
what	's	happening	here	,	in	the	middle	of	the	17th	century	,	was	that	what	became	my	field	--	science	,	experimental	science	--	was	pulling	itself	away	,	and	it	was	in	a	physical	way	,	because	we	're	going	to	do	it	in	this	room	over	here	,	but	it	was	also	what	--	it	was	an	amazing	thing	that	happened	.
science	had	been	all	interlocked	with	theology	,	and	philosophy	,	and	--	and	--	and	mathematics	,	which	is	really	not	science	.
but	experimental	science	had	been	tied	up	with	all	those	things	.
and	the	mathematics	part	and	the	experimental	science	part	was	pulling	away	from	philosophy	.
and	--	things	--	we	never	looked	back	.
it	's	been	so	cool	since	then	.
i	mean	,	it	just	--	it	just	--	untangled	a	thing	that	was	really	impeding	technology	from	being	developed	.
and	,	i	mean	,	everybody	in	this	room	--	now	,	this	is	350	short	years	ago	.
remember	,	that	's	a	short	time	.
it	was	300,000	,	probably	,	years	ago	that	most	of	us	,	the	ancestors	of	most	of	us	in	this	room	came	up	out	of	africa	and	turned	to	the	left	.
you	know	,	the	ones	that	turned	to	the	right	,	there	are	some	of	those	in	the	japanese	translation	.
but	that	happened	very	--	a	long	time	ago	compared	to	350	short	years	ago	.
but	in	that	350	years	,	the	place	has	just	undergone	a	lot	of	changes	.
in	fact	,	everybody	in	this	room	probably	,	especially	if	you	picked	up	your	bag	--	some	of	you	,	i	know	,	did	n't	pick	up	your	bags	--	but	if	you	picked	up	your	bag	,	everybody	in	this	room	has	got	in	their	pocket	,	or	back	in	their	room	,	something	that	350	years	ago	,	kings	would	have	gone	to	war	to	have	.
i	mean	,	if	you	can	think	how	important	--	if	you	have	a	gps	system	and	there	are	no	satellites	,	it	's	not	going	to	be	much	use	.	but	,	like	--	but	,	you	know	,	if	somebody	had	a	gps	system	in	the	17th	century	some	king	would	have	gotten	together	an	army	and	gone	to	get	it	,	you	know	.	if	that	person	--	audience	:	for	the	teddy	bear	?	the	teddy	bear	?
kary	mullis	:	they	might	have	done	it	for	the	teddy	bear	,	yeah	.
but	--	all	of	us	own	stuff	.
i	mean	,	individuals	own	things	that	kings	would	have	definitely	gone	to	war	to	get	.
and	this	is	just	350	years	.
not	a	whole	lot	of	people	doing	this	stuff	.
you	know	,	the	important	people	--	you	can	almost	read	about	their	lives	,	about	all	the	really	important	people	that	made	advances	,	you	know	.
and	,	i	mean	--	this	kind	of	stuff	,	you	know	,	all	this	stuff	came	from	that	separation	of	this	little	sort	of	thing	that	we	do	--	now	i	,	when	i	was	a	boy	was	born	sort	of	with	this	idea	that	if	you	want	to	know	something	--	you	know	,	maybe	it	's	because	my	old	man	was	gone	a	lot	,	and	my	mother	did	n't	really	know	much	science	,	but	i	thought	if	you	want	to	know	something	about	stuff	,	you	do	it	--	you	make	an	experiment	,	you	know	.
you	get	--	you	get	,	like	--	i	just	had	a	natural	feeling	for	science	and	setting	up	experiments	.	i	thought	that	was	the	way	everybody	had	always	thought	.
i	thought	that	anybody	with	any	brains	will	do	it	that	way	.
it	is	n't	true	.	i	mean	,	there	's	a	lot	of	people	--	you	know	,	i	was	one	of	those	scientists	that	was	--	got	into	trouble	the	other	night	at	dinner	because	of	the	post	-	modernism	thing	.
and	i	did	n't	mean	,	you	know	--	where	is	that	lady	?
audience	:	here	.
km	:	i	mean	,	i	did	n't	really	think	of	that	as	an	argument	so	much	as	just	a	lively	discussion	.
i	did	n't	take	it	personally	,	but	--	i	just	--	i	had	--	i	naively	had	thought	,	until	this	surfing	experience	started	me	into	the	17th	century	,	i	'd	thought	that	's	just	the	way	people	thought	,	and	everybody	did	,	and	they	recognized	reality	by	what	they	could	see	or	touch	or	feel	or	hear	.
at	any	rate	,	when	i	was	a	boy	,	i	,	like	,	for	instance	,	i	had	this	--	i	got	this	little	book	from	fort	sill	,	oklahoma	--	this	is	about	the	time	that	george	dyson	's	dad	was	starting	to	blow	nuclear	--	thinking	about	blowing	up	nuclear	rockets	and	stuff	.
i	was	thinking	about	making	my	own	little	rockets	.
and	i	knew	that	frogs	--	little	frogs	--	had	aspirations	of	space	travel	,	just	like	people	.	and	i	--	i	was	looking	for	a	--	a	propulsion	system	that	would	like	,	make	a	rocket	,	like	,	maybe	about	four	feet	high	go	up	a	couple	of	miles	.
and	,	i	mean	,	that	was	my	sort	of	goal	.
i	wanted	it	to	go	out	of	sight	and	then	i	wanted	this	little	parachute	to	come	back	with	the	frog	in	it	.	and	--	i	--	i	--	i	got	this	book	from	fort	sill	,	oklahoma	,	where	there	's	a	missile	base	.
they	send	it	out	for	amateur	rocketeers	,	and	it	said	in	there	do	not	ever	heat	a	mixture	of	potassium	perchlorate	and	sugar	.
you	know	,	that	's	what	you	call	a	lead	.	you	sort	of	--	now	you	say	,	well	,	let	's	see	if	i	can	get	hold	of	some	potassium	chlorate	and	sugar	,	perchlorate	and	sugar	,	and	heat	it	;	it	would	be	interesting	to	see	what	it	is	they	do	n't	want	me	to	do	,	and	what	it	is	going	to	--	and	how	is	it	going	to	work	.
and	we	did	n't	have	--	like	,	my	mother	presided	over	the	back	yard	from	an	upstairs	window	,	where	she	would	be	ironing	or	something	like	that	.
and	she	was	usually	just	sort	of	keeping	an	eye	on	,	and	if	there	was	any	puffs	of	smoke	out	there	,	she	'd	lean	out	and	admonish	us	all	not	to	blow	our	eyes	out	.	that	was	her	--	you	know	,	that	was	kind	of	the	worst	thing	that	could	happen	to	us	.
that	's	why	i	thought	,	as	long	as	i	do	n't	blow	my	eyes	out	...
i	may	not	care	about	the	fact	that	it	's	prohibited	from	heating	this	solution	.
i	'm	going	to	do	it	carefully	,	but	i	'll	do	it	.
it	's	like	anything	else	that	's	prohibited	:	you	do	it	behind	the	garage	.
so	,	i	went	to	the	drug	store	and	i	tried	to	buy	some	potassium	perchlorate	and	it	was	n't	unreasonable	then	for	a	kid	to	walk	into	a	drug	store	and	buy	chemicals	.
nowadays	,	it	's	no	ma'am	,	check	your	shoes	.	and	like	--	but	then	it	was	n't	--	they	did	n't	have	any	,	but	the	guy	had	--	i	said	,	what	kind	of	salts	or	potassium	do	you	have	?	you	know	.
and	he	had	potassium	nitrate	.
and	i	said	,	that	might	do	the	same	thing	,	whatever	it	is	.
i	'm	sure	it	's	got	to	do	with	rockets	or	it	would	n't	be	in	that	manual	.
and	so	i	--	i	did	some	experiments	.
you	know	,	i	started	off	with	little	tiny	amounts	of	potassium	nitrate	and	sugar	,	which	was	readily	available	,	and	i	mixed	it	in	different	proportions	,	and	i	tried	to	light	it	on	fire	.
just	to	see	what	would	happen	,	if	you	mixed	it	together	.	and	it	--	they	burned	.
it	burned	kind	of	slow	,	but	it	made	a	nice	smell	,	compared	to	other	rocket	fuels	i	had	tried	,	that	all	had	sulfur	in	them	.
and	,	it	smelt	like	burnt	candy	.
and	then	i	tried	the	melting	business	,	and	i	melted	it	.
and	then	it	melted	into	a	little	sort	of	syrupy	liquid	,	brown	.
and	then	it	cooled	down	to	a	brick	-	hard	substance	,	that	when	you	lit	that	,	it	went	off	like	a	bat	.
i	mean	,	the	little	bowl	of	that	stuff	that	had	cooled	down	--	you	'd	light	it	,	and	it	would	just	start	dancing	around	the	yard	.
and	i	said	,	there	is	a	way	to	get	a	frog	up	to	where	he	wants	to	go	.
so	i	started	developing	--	you	know	,	george	's	dad	had	a	lot	of	help	.	i	just	had	my	brother	.
but	i	--	it	took	me	about	--	it	took	me	about	,	i	'd	say	,	six	months	to	finally	figure	out	all	the	little	things	.
there	's	a	lot	of	little	things	involved	in	making	a	rocket	that	it	will	actually	work	,	even	after	you	have	the	fuel	.
but	you	do	it	,	by	--	what	i	just	--	you	know	,	you	do	experiments	,	and	you	write	down	things	sometimes	,	you	make	observations	,	you	know	.
and	then	you	slowly	build	up	a	theory	of	how	this	stuff	works	.
and	it	was	--	i	was	following	all	the	rules	.
i	did	n't	know	what	the	rules	were	,	i	'm	a	natural	born	scientist	,	i	guess	,	or	some	kind	of	a	throwback	to	the	17th	century	,	whatever	.
but	at	any	rate	,	we	finally	did	have	a	device	that	would	reproduceably	put	a	frog	out	of	sight	and	get	him	back	alive	.
and	we	had	not	--	i	mean	,	we	were	n't	frightened	by	it	.
we	should	have	been	,	because	it	made	a	lot	of	smoke	and	it	made	a	lot	of	noise	,	and	it	was	powerful	,	you	know	.
and	once	in	a	while	,	they	would	blow	up	.
but	i	was	n't	worried	,	by	the	way	,	about	,	you	know	,	the	explosion	causing	the	destruction	of	the	planet	.
i	had	n't	heard	about	the	10	ways	that	we	should	be	afraid	of	the	--	by	the	way	,	i	could	have	thought	,	i	'd	better	not	do	this	because	they	say	not	to	,	you	know	.
and	i	'd	better	get	permission	from	the	government	.
if	i	'd	have	waited	around	for	that	,	i	would	have	never	--	the	frog	would	have	died	,	you	know	.
at	any	rate	,	i	bring	it	up	because	it	's	a	good	story	,	and	he	said	,	tell	personal	things	,	you	know	,	and	that	's	a	personal	--	i	was	going	to	tell	you	about	the	first	night	that	i	met	my	wife	,	but	that	would	be	too	personal	,	would	n't	it	.
so	,	so	i	've	got	something	else	that	's	not	personal	.
but	that	...	process	is	what	i	think	of	as	science	,	see	,	where	you	start	with	some	idea	,	and	then	instead	of	,	like	,	looking	up	,	every	authority	that	you	've	ever	heard	of	i	--	sometimes	you	do	that	,	if	you	're	going	to	write	a	paper	later	,	you	want	to	figure	out	who	else	has	worked	on	it	.
but	in	the	actual	process	,	you	get	an	idea	--	like	,	when	i	got	the	idea	one	night	that	i	could	amplify	dna	with	two	oligonucleotides	,	and	i	could	make	lots	of	copies	of	some	little	piece	of	dna	,	you	know	,	the	thinking	for	that	was	about	20	minutes	while	i	was	driving	my	car	,	and	then	instead	of	going	--	i	went	back	and	i	did	talk	to	people	about	it	,	but	if	i	'd	listened	to	what	i	heard	from	all	my	friends	who	were	molecular	biologists	--	i	would	have	abandoned	it	.
you	know	,	if	i	had	gone	back	looking	for	an	authority	figure	who	could	tell	me	if	it	would	work	or	not	,	he	would	have	said	,	no	,	it	probably	wo	n't	.
because	the	results	of	it	were	so	spectacular	that	if	it	worked	it	was	going	to	change	everybody	's	goddamn	way	of	doing	molecular	biology	.
nobody	wants	a	chemist	to	come	in	and	poke	around	in	their	stuff	like	that	and	change	things	.
but	if	you	go	to	authority	,	and	you	always	do	n't	--	you	do	n't	always	get	the	right	answer	,	see	.
but	i	knew	,	you	'd	go	into	the	lab	and	you	'd	try	to	make	it	work	yourself	.	and	then	you	're	the	authority	,	and	you	can	say	,	i	know	it	works	,	because	right	there	in	that	tube	is	where	it	happened	,	and	here	,	on	this	gel	,	there	's	a	little	band	there	that	i	know	that	's	dna	,	and	that	's	the	dna	i	wanted	to	amplify	,	so	there	!	so	it	does	work	.
you	know	,	that	's	how	you	do	science	.
and	then	you	say	,	well	,	what	can	make	it	work	better	?
and	then	you	figure	out	better	and	better	ways	to	do	it	.
but	you	always	work	from	,	from	like	,	facts	that	you	have	made	available	to	you	by	doing	experiments	:	things	that	you	could	do	on	a	stage	.
and	no	tricky	shit	behind	the	thing	.	i	mean	,	it	's	all	--	you	've	got	to	be	very	honest	with	what	you	're	doing	if	it	really	is	going	to	work	.
i	mean	,	you	ca	n't	make	up	results	,	and	then	do	another	experiment	based	on	that	one	.
so	you	have	to	be	honest	.
and	i	'm	basically	honest	.
i	have	a	fairly	bad	memory	,	and	dishonesty	would	always	get	me	in	trouble	,	if	i	,	like	--	so	i	've	just	sort	of	been	naturally	honest	and	naturally	inquisitive	,	and	that	sort	of	leads	to	that	kind	of	science	.
now	,	let	's	see	...
i	've	got	another	five	minutes	,	right	?
ok	.	all	scientists	are	n't	like	that	.
you	know	--	and	there	is	a	lot	--	there	is	a	lot	--	a	lot	has	been	going	on	since	isaac	newton	and	all	that	stuff	happened	.
one	of	the	things	that	happened	right	around	world	war	ii	in	that	same	time	period	before	,	and	as	sure	as	hell	afterwards	,	government	got	--	realized	that	scientists	are	n't	strange	dudes	that	,	you	know	,	hide	in	ivory	towers	and	do	ridiculous	things	with	test	tube	.
scientists	,	you	know	,	made	world	war	ii	as	we	know	it	quite	possible	.
they	made	faster	things	.
they	made	bigger	guns	to	shoot	them	down	with	.
you	know	,	they	made	drugs	to	give	the	pilots	if	they	were	broken	up	in	the	process	.	they	made	all	kinds	of	--	and	then	finally	one	giant	bomb	to	end	the	whole	thing	,	right	?
and	everybody	stepped	back	a	little	and	said	,	you	know	,	we	ought	to	invest	in	this	shit	,	because	whoever	has	got	the	most	of	these	people	working	in	the	places	is	going	to	have	a	dominant	position	,	at	least	in	the	military	,	and	probably	in	all	kind	of	economic	ways	.
and	they	got	involved	in	it	,	and	the	scientific	and	industrial	establishment	was	born	,	and	out	of	that	came	a	lot	of	scientists	who	were	in	there	for	the	money	,	you	know	,	because	it	was	suddenly	available	.
and	they	were	n't	the	curious	little	boys	that	liked	to	put	frogs	up	in	the	air	.
they	were	the	same	people	that	later	went	in	to	medical	school	,	you	know	,	because	there	was	money	in	it	,	you	know	.	i	mean	,	later	,	then	they	all	got	into	business	--	i	mean	,	there	are	waves	of	--	going	into	your	high	school	,	person	saying	,	you	want	to	be	rich	,	you	know	,	be	a	scientist	.	you	know	,	not	anymore	.
you	want	to	be	rich	,	you	be	a	businessman	.
but	a	lot	of	people	got	in	it	for	the	money	and	the	power	and	the	travel	.
that	's	back	when	travel	was	easy	.
and	those	people	do	n't	think	--	they	do	n't	--	they	do	n't	always	tell	you	the	truth	,	you	know	.
there	is	nothing	in	their	contract	,	in	fact	,	that	makes	it	to	their	advantage	always	,	to	tell	you	the	truth	.
and	the	people	i	'm	talking	about	are	people	that	like	--	they	say	that	they	're	a	member	of	the	committee	called	,	say	,	the	inter	-	governmental	panel	on	climate	change	.
and	they	--	and	they	have	these	big	meetings	where	they	try	to	figure	out	how	we	're	going	to	--	how	we	're	going	to	continually	prove	that	the	planet	is	getting	warmer	,	when	that	's	actually	contrary	to	most	people	's	sensations	.
i	mean	,	if	you	actually	measure	the	temperature	over	a	period	--	i	mean	,	the	temperature	has	been	measured	now	pretty	carefully	for	about	50	,	60	years	--	longer	than	that	it	's	been	measured	,	but	in	really	nice	,	precise	ways	,	and	records	have	been	kept	for	50	or	60	years	,	and	in	fact	,	the	temperature	had	n't	really	gone	up	.
it	's	like	,	the	average	temperature	has	gone	up	a	tiny	little	bit	,	because	the	nighttime	temperatures	at	the	weather	stations	have	come	up	just	a	little	bit	.
but	there	's	a	good	explanation	for	that	.
and	it	's	that	the	weather	stations	are	all	built	outside	of	town	,	where	the	airport	was	,	and	now	the	town	's	moved	out	there	,	there	's	concrete	all	around	and	they	call	it	the	skyline	effect	.
and	most	responsible	people	that	measure	temperatures	realize	you	have	to	shield	your	measuring	device	from	that	.
and	even	then	,	you	know	,	because	the	buildings	get	warm	in	the	daytime	,	and	they	keep	it	a	little	warmer	at	night	.
so	the	temperature	has	been	,	sort	of	,	inching	up	.
it	should	have	been	.	but	not	a	lot	.	not	like	,	you	know	--	the	first	guy	--	the	first	guy	that	got	the	idea	that	we	're	going	to	fry	ourselves	here	,	actually	,	he	did	n't	think	of	it	that	way	.
his	name	was	sven	arrhenius	.	he	was	swedish	,	and	he	said	,	if	you	double	the	co	2	level	in	the	atmosphere	,	which	he	thought	might	--	this	is	in	1900	--	the	temperature	ought	to	go	up	about	5.5	degrees	,	he	calculated	.
he	was	thinking	of	the	earth	as	,	kind	of	like	,	you	know	,	like	a	completely	insulated	thing	with	no	stuff	in	it	,	really	,	just	energy	coming	down	,	energy	leaving	.
and	so	he	came	up	with	this	theory	,	and	he	said	,	this	will	be	cool	,	because	it	'll	be	a	longer	growing	season	in	sweden	,	you	know	,	and	the	surfers	liked	it	,	the	surfers	thought	,	that	's	a	cool	idea	,	because	it	's	pretty	cold	in	the	ocean	sometimes	,	and	--	but	a	lot	of	other	people	later	on	started	thinking	it	would	be	bad	,	you	know	.
but	nobody	actually	demonstrated	it	,	right	?
i	mean	,	the	temperature	as	measured	--	and	you	can	find	this	on	our	wonderful	internet	,	you	just	go	and	look	for	all	nasas	records	,	and	all	the	weather	bureau	's	records	,	and	you	'll	look	at	it	yourself	,	and	you	'll	see	,	the	temperature	has	just	--	the	nighttime	temperature	measured	on	the	surface	of	the	planet	has	gone	up	a	tiny	little	bit	.
so	if	you	just	average	that	and	the	daytime	temperature	,	it	looks	like	it	went	up	about	.7	degrees	in	this	century	.
but	in	fact	,	it	was	just	coming	up	--	it	was	the	nighttime	;	the	daytime	temperatures	did	n't	go	up	.
so	--	and	arrhenius	'	theory	--	and	all	the	global	warmers	think	--	they	would	say	,	yeah	,	it	should	go	up	in	the	daytime	,	too	,	if	it	's	the	greenhouse	effect	.
now	,	people	like	things	that	have	,	like	,	names	like	that	,	that	they	can	envision	it	,	right	?	i	mean	--	but	people	do	n't	like	things	like	this	,	so	--	most	--	i	mean	,	you	do	n't	get	all	excited	about	things	like	the	actual	evidence	,	you	know	,	which	would	be	evidence	for	strengthening	of	the	tropical	circulation	in	the	1990s	.
it	's	a	paper	that	came	out	in	february	,	and	most	of	you	probably	had	n't	heard	about	it	.
``	evidence	for	large	decadal	variability	in	the	tropical	mean	radiative	energy	budget	.	``
excuse	me	.	those	papers	were	published	by	nasa	,	and	some	scientists	at	columbia	,	and	viliki	and	a	whole	bunch	of	people	,	princeton	.
and	those	two	papers	came	out	in	science	magazine	,	february	the	first	,	and	these	--	the	conclusion	in	both	of	these	papers	,	and	in	also	the	science	editor	's	,	like	,	descriptions	of	these	papers	,	for	,	you	know	,	for	the	quickie	,	is	that	our	theories	about	global	warming	are	completely	wrong	.	i	mean	,	what	these	guys	were	doing	,	and	this	is	what	--	the	nasa	people	have	been	saying	this	for	a	long	time	.
they	say	,	if	you	measure	the	temperature	of	the	atmosphere	,	it	is	n't	going	up	--	it	's	not	going	up	at	all	.	we	've	doing	it	very	carefully	now	for	20	years	,	from	satellites	,	and	it	is	n't	going	up	.	and	in	this	paper	,	they	show	something	much	more	striking	,	and	that	was	that	they	did	what	they	call	a	radiation	--	and	i	'm	not	going	to	go	into	the	details	of	it	,	actually	it	's	quite	complicated	,	but	it	is	n't	as	complicated	as	they	might	make	you	think	it	is	by	the	words	they	use	in	those	papers	.	if	you	really	get	down	to	it	,	they	say	,	the	sun	puts	out	a	certain	amount	of	energy	--	we	know	how	much	that	is	--	it	falls	on	the	earth	,	the	earth	gives	back	a	certain	amount	.
when	it	gets	warm	it	generates	--	it	makes	redder	energy	--	i	mean	,	like	infra	-	red	,
like	something	that	's	warm	gives	off	infra	-	red	.
the	whole	business	of	the	global	warming	--	trash	,	really	,	is	that	--	if	the	--	if	there	's	too	much	co	2	in	the	atmosphere	,	the	heat	that	's	trying	to	escape	wo	n't	be	able	to	get	out	.	but	the	heat	coming	from	the	sun	,	which	is	mostly	down	in	the	--	it	's	like	350	nanometers	,	which	is	where	it	's	centered	--	that	goes	right	through	co	2	.
so	you	still	get	heated	,	but	you	do	n't	dissipate	any	.
well	,	these	guys	measured	all	of	those	things	.
i	mean	,	you	can	talk	about	that	stuff	,	and	you	can	write	these	large	reports	,	and	you	can	get	government	money	to	do	it	,	but	these	--	they	actually	measured	it	,	and	it	turns	out	that	in	the	last	10	years	--	that	's	why	they	say	``	decadal	``	there	--
that	the	energy	--	that	the	level	of	what	they	call	``	imbalance	``	has	been	way	the	hell	over	what	was	expected	.
like	,	the	amount	of	imbalance	--	meaning	,	heat	's	coming	in	and	it	's	not	going	out	that	you	would	get	from	having	double	the	co	2	,	which	we	're	not	anywhere	near	that	,	by	the	way	.
but	if	we	did	,	in	2025	or	something	,	have	double	the	co	2	as	we	had	in	1900	,	they	say	it	would	be	increase	the	energy	budget	by	about	--	in	other	words	,	one	watt	per	square	centimeter	more	would	be	coming	in	than	going	out	.
so	the	planet	should	get	warmer	.
well	,	they	found	out	in	this	study	--	these	two	studies	by	two	different	teams	--	that	five	and	a	half	watts	per	square	meter	had	been	coming	in	from	1998	,	1999	,	and	the	place	did	n't	get	warmer	.
so	the	theory	's	kaput	--	it	's	nothing	.
these	papers	should	have	been	called	,	``	the	end	to	the	global	warming	fiasco	,	``	you	know	.
they	're	concerned	,	and	you	can	tell	they	have	very	guarded	conclusions	in	these	papers	,	because	they	're	talking	about	big	laboratories	that	are	funded	by	lots	of	money	and	by	scared	people	.
you	know	,	if	they	said	,	you	know	what	?
there	is	n't	a	problem	with	global	warming	any	longer	,	so	we	can	--	you	know	,	they	're	funding	.
and	if	you	start	a	grant	request	with	something	like	that	,	and	say	,	global	warming	obviously	had	n't	happened	...
if	they	--	if	they	--	if	they	actually	--	if	they	actually	said	that	,	i	'm	getting	out	.
i	'll	stand	up	too	,	and	--	they	have	to	say	that	.
they	had	to	be	very	cautious	.
but	what	i	'm	saying	is	,	you	can	be	delighted	,	because	the	editor	of	science	,	who	is	no	dummy	,	and	both	of	these	fairly	professional	--	really	professional	teams	,	have	really	come	to	the	same	conclusion	and	in	the	bottom	lines	in	their	papers	they	have	to	say	,	what	this	means	is	,	that	what	we	've	been	thinking	,	was	the	global	circulation	model	that	we	predict	that	the	earth	is	going	to	get	overheated	that	it	's	all	wrong	.	it	's	wrong	by	a	large	factor	.
it	's	not	by	a	small	one	.	they	just	--
they	just	misinterpreted	the	fact	that	the	earth	--	there	's	obviously	some	mechanisms	going	on	that	nobody	knew	about	,	because	the	heat	's	coming	in	and	it	is	n't	getting	warmer	.
so	the	planet	is	a	pretty	amazing	thing	,	you	know	,	it	's	big	and	horrible	--	and	big	and	wonderful	,	and	it	does	all	kinds	of	things	we	do	n't	know	anything	about	.
so	i	mean	,	the	reason	i	put	those	things	all	together	,	ok	,	here	's	the	way	you	're	supposed	to	do	science	--	some	science	is	done	for	other	reasons	,	and	just	curiosity	.
and	there	's	a	lot	of	things	like	global	warming	,	and	ozone	hole	and	you	know	,	a	whole	bunch	of	scientific	public	issues	,	that	if	you	're	interested	in	them	,	then	you	have	to	get	down	the	details	,	and	read	the	papers	called	,	``	large	decadal	variability	in	the	...	``
you	have	to	figure	out	what	all	those	words	mean	.
and	if	you	just	listen	to	the	guys	who	are	hyping	those	issues	,	and	making	a	lot	of	money	out	of	it	,	you	'll	be	misinformed	,	and	you	'll	be	worrying	about	the	wrong	things	.
remember	the	10	things	that	are	going	to	get	you	.	the	--	one	of	them	--	and	the	asteroids	is	the	one	i	really	agree	with	there	.	i	mean	,	you	've	got	to	watch	out	for	asteroids	.	ok	,	thank	you	for	having	me	here	.
