delighted	to	be	here	and	to	talk	to	you	about	a	subject	dear	to	my	heart	,	which	is	beauty	.
i	do	the	philosophy	of	art	,	aesthetics	,	actually	,	for	a	living	.
i	try	to	figure	out	intellectually	,	philosophically	,	psychologically	,	what	the	experience	of	beauty	is	,	what	sensibly	can	be	said	about	it	and	how	people	go	off	the	rails	in	trying	to	understand	it	.
now	this	is	an	extremely	complicated	subject	,	in	part	because	the	things	that	we	call	beautiful	are	so	different	.
i	mean	just	think	of	the	sheer	variety	--	a	baby	's	face	,	berlioz	's	``	harold	in	italy	,	``	movies	like	``	the	wizard	of	oz	``	or	the	plays	of	chekhov	,	a	central	california	landscape	,	a	hokusai	view	of	mt	.	fuji	,	``	der	rosenkavalier	,	``	a	stunning	match	-	winning	goal	in	a	world	cup	soccer	match	,	van	gogh	's	``	starry	night	,	``	a	jane	austen	novel	,	fred	astaire	dancing	across	the	screen	.
this	brief	list	includes	human	beings	,	natural	landforms	,	works	of	art	and	skilled	human	actions	.
an	account	that	explains	the	presence	of	beauty	in	everything	on	this	list	is	not	going	to	be	easy	.
i	can	,	however	,	give	you	at	least	a	taste	of	what	i	regard	as	the	most	powerful	theory	of	beauty	we	yet	have	.
and	we	get	it	not	from	a	philosopher	of	art	,	not	from	a	postmodern	art	theorist	or	a	bigwig	art	critic	.
no	,	this	theory	comes	from	an	expert	on	barnacles	and	worms	and	pigeon	breeding	,
and	you	know	who	i	mean	:	charles	darwin	.
of	course	,	a	lot	of	people	think	they	already	know	the	proper	answer	to	the	question	,	``	what	is	beauty	?	``
it	's	in	the	eye	of	the	beholder	.
it	's	whatever	moves	you	personally	.
or	,	as	some	people	,	especially	academics	prefer	,	beauty	is	in	the	culturally	conditioned	eye	of	the	beholder	.
people	agree	that	paintings	or	movies	or	music	are	beautiful	because	their	cultures	determine	a	uniformity	of	aesthetic	taste	.
taste	for	both	natural	beauty	and	for	the	arts	travel	across	cultures	with	great	ease	.
beethoven	is	adored	in	japan	.
peruvians	love	japanese	woodblock	prints	.
inca	sculptures	are	regarded	as	treasures	in	british	museums	,	while	shakespeare	is	translated	into	every	major	language	of	the	earth	.
or	just	think	about	american	jazz	or	american	movies	--	they	go	everywhere	.
there	are	many	differences	among	the	arts	,	but	there	are	also	universal	,	cross	-	cultural	aesthetic	pleasures	and	values	.
how	can	we	explain	this	universality	?
the	best	answer	lies	in	trying	to	reconstruct	a	darwinian	evolutionary	history	of	our	artistic	and	aesthetic	tastes	.
we	need	to	reverse	-	engineer	our	present	artistic	tastes	and	preferences	and	explain	how	they	came	to	be	engraved	in	our	minds
by	the	actions	of	both	our	prehistoric	,	largely	pleistocene	environments	,	where	we	became	fully	human	,	but	also	by	the	social	situations	in	which	we	evolved	.
this	reverse	engineering	can	also	enlist	help	from	the	human	record	preserved	in	prehistory	.
i	mean	fossils	,	cave	paintings	and	so	forth	.
and	it	should	take	into	account	what	we	know	of	the	aesthetic	interests	of	isolated	hunter	-	gatherer	bands	that	survived	into	the	19th	and	the	20th	centuries	.
now	,	i	personally	have	no	doubt	whatsoever	that	the	experience	of	beauty	,	with	its	emotional	intensity	and	pleasure	,	belongs	to	our	evolved	human	psychology	.
the	experience	of	beauty	is	one	component	in	a	whole	series	of	darwinian	adaptations	.
beauty	is	an	adaptive	effect	,	which	we	extend	and	intensify	in	the	creation	and	enjoyment	of	works	of	art	and	entertainment	.
as	many	of	you	will	know	,	evolution	operates	by	two	main	primary	mechanisms	.
the	first	of	these	is	natural	selection	--	that	's	random	mutation	and	selective	retention	--	along	with	our	basic	anatomy	and	physiology	--	the	evolution	of	the	pancreas	or	the	eye	or	the	fingernails	.
natural	selection	also	explains	many	basic	revulsions	,	such	as	the	horrid	smell	of	rotting	meat	,	or	fears	,	such	as	the	fear	of	snakes	or	standing	close	to	the	edge	of	a	cliff	.
natural	selection	also	explains	pleasures	--	sexual	pleasure	,	our	liking	for	sweet	,	fat	and	proteins	,	which	in	turn	explains	a	lot	of	popular	foods	,	from	ripe	fruits	through	chocolate	malts	and	barbecued	ribs	.
the	other	great	principle	of	evolution	is	sexual	selection	,	and	it	operates	very	differently	.
the	peacock	's	magnificent	tail	is	the	most	famous	example	of	this	.
it	did	not	evolve	for	natural	survival	.
in	fact	,	it	goes	against	natural	survival	.
no	,	the	peacock	's	tail	results	from	the	mating	choices	made	by	peahens	.
it	's	quite	a	familiar	story	.
it	's	women	who	actually	push	history	forward	.
darwin	himself	,	by	the	way	,	had	no	doubts	that	the	peacock	's	tail	was	beautiful	in	the	eyes	of	the	peahen	.
he	actually	used	that	word	.
now	,	keeping	these	ideas	firmly	in	mind	,	we	can	say	that	the	experience	of	beauty	is	one	of	the	ways	that	evolution	has	of	arousing	and	sustaining	interest	or	fascination	,	even	obsession	,	in	order	to	encourage	us	toward	making	the	most	adaptive	decisions	for	survival	and	reproduction	.
beauty	is	nature	's	way	of	acting	at	a	distance	,	so	to	speak	.
i	mean	,	you	ca	n't	expect	to	eat	an	adaptively	beneficial	landscape	.
it	would	hardly	do	to	eat	your	baby	or	your	lover	.
so	evolution	's	trick	is	to	make	them	beautiful	,	to	have	them	exert	a	kind	of	magnetism	to	give	you	the	pleasure	of	simply	looking	at	them	.
consider	briefly	an	important	source	of	aesthetic	pleasure	,	the	magnetic	pull	of	beautiful	landscapes	.
people	in	very	different	cultures	all	over	the	world	tend	to	like	a	particular	kind	of	landscape	,	a	landscape	that	just	happens	to	be	similar	to	the	pleistocene	savannas	where	we	evolved	.
this	landscape	shows	up	today	on	calendars	,	on	postcards	,	in	the	design	of	golf	courses	and	public	parks	and	in	gold	-	framed	pictures	that	hang	in	living	rooms	from	new	york	to	new	zealand	.
it	's	a	kind	of	hudson	river	school	landscape	featuring	open	spaces	of	low	grasses	interspersed	with	copses	of	trees	.
the	trees	,	by	the	way	,	are	often	preferred	if	they	fork	near	the	ground	,	that	is	to	say	,	if	they	're	trees	you	could	scramble	up	if	you	were	in	a	tight	fix	.
the	landscape	shows	the	presence	of	water	directly	in	view	,	or	evidence	of	water	in	a	bluish	distance	,	indications	of	animal	or	bird	life	as	well	as	diverse	greenery	and	finally	--	get	this	--	a	path	or	a	road	,	perhaps	a	riverbank	or	a	shoreline	,	that	extends	into	the	distance	,	almost	inviting	you	to	follow	it	.
this	landscape	type	is	regarded	as	beautiful	,	even	by	people	in	countries	that	do	n't	have	it	.
the	ideal	savanna	landscape	is	one	of	the	clearest	examples	where	human	beings	everywhere	find	beauty	in	similar	visual	experience	.
but	,	someone	might	argue	,	that	's	natural	beauty	.
how	about	artistic	beauty	?
is	n't	that	exhaustively	cultural	?
no	,	i	do	n't	think	it	is	.
and	once	again	,	i	'd	like	to	look	back	to	prehistory	to	say	something	about	it	.
it	is	widely	assumed	that	the	earliest	human	artworks	are	the	stupendously	skillful	cave	paintings	that	we	all	know	from	lascaux	and	chauvet	.
chauvet	caves	are	about	32,000	years	old	,	along	with	a	few	small	,	realistic	sculptures	of	women	and	animals	from	the	same	period	.
but	artistic	and	decorative	skills	are	actually	much	older	than	that	.	beautiful	shell	necklaces	that	look	like	something	you	'd	see	at	an	arts	and	crafts	fair	,	as	well	as	ochre	body	paint	,	have	been	found	from	around	100,000	years	ago	.
but	the	most	intriguing	prehistoric	artifacts	are	older	even	than	this	.
i	have	in	mind	the	so	-	called	acheulian	hand	axes	.
the	oldest	stone	tools	are	choppers	from	the	olduvai	gorge	in	east	africa	.
they	go	back	about	two	-	and	-	a	-	half	-	million	years	.
these	crude	tools	were	around	for	thousands	of	centuries	,	until	around	1.4	million	years	ago	when	homo	erectus	started	shaping	single	,	thin	stone	blades	,	sometimes	rounded	ovals	,	but	often	in	what	are	to	our	eyes	an	arresting	,	symmetrical	pointed	leaf	or	teardrop	form	.
these	acheulian	hand	axes	--	they	're	named	after	st.	acheul	in	france	,	where	finds	were	made	in	19th	century	--	have	been	unearthed	in	their	thousands	,	scattered	across	asia	,	europe	and	africa	,	almost	everywhere	homo	erectus	and	homo	ergaster	roamed	.
now	,	the	sheer	numbers	of	these	hand	axes	shows	that	they	ca	n't	have	been	made	for	butchering	animals	.
and	the	plot	really	thickens	when	you	realize	that	,	unlike	other	pleistocene	tools	,	the	hand	axes	often	exhibit	no	evidence	of	wear	on	their	delicate	blade	edges	.
and	some	,	in	any	event	,	are	too	big	to	use	for	butchery	.
their	symmetry	,	their	attractive	materials	and	,	above	all	,	their	meticulous	workmanship	are	simply	quite	beautiful	to	our	eyes	,	even	today	.
so	what	were	these	ancient	--	i	mean	,	they	're	ancient	,	they	're	foreign	,	but	they	're	at	the	same	time	somehow	familiar	.
what	were	these	artifacts	for	?
the	best	available	answer	is	that	they	were	literally	the	earliest	known	works	of	art	,	practical	tools	transformed	into	captivating	aesthetic	objects	,	contemplated	both	for	their	elegant	shape	and	their	virtuoso	craftsmanship	.
hand	axes	mark	an	evolutionary	advance	in	human	history	--	tools	fashioned	to	function	as	what	darwinians	call	``	fitness	signals	``	--	that	is	to	say	,	displays	that	are	performances	like	the	peacock	's	tail	,	except	that	,	unlike	hair	and	feathers	,	the	hand	axes	are	consciously	cleverly	crafted	.
competently	made	hand	axes	indicated	desirable	personal	qualities	--	intelligence	,	fine	motor	control	,	planning	ability	,	conscientiousness	and	sometimes	access	to	rare	materials	.
over	tens	of	thousands	of	generations	,	such	skills	increased	the	status	of	those	who	displayed	them	and	gained	a	reproductive	advantage	over	the	less	capable	.
you	know	,	it	's	an	old	line	,	but	it	has	been	shown	to	work	--	``	why	do	n't	you	come	up	to	my	cave	,	so	i	can	show	you	my	hand	axes	?	``	except	,	of	course	,	what	's	interesting	about	this	is	that	we	ca	n't	be	sure	how	that	idea	was	conveyed	,	because	the	homo	erectus	that	made	these	objects	did	not	have	language	.
it	's	hard	to	grasp	,	but	it	's	an	incredible	fact	.
this	object	was	made	by	a	hominid	ancestor	,	homo	erectus	or	homo	ergaster	,	between	50,000	and	100,000	years	before	language	.
stretching	over	a	million	years	,	the	hand	axe	tradition	is	the	longest	artistic	tradition	in	human	and	proto	-	human	history	.
by	the	end	of	the	hand	axe	epic	,	homo	sapiens	--	as	they	were	then	called	,	finally	--	were	doubtless	finding	new	ways	to	amuse	and	amaze	each	other	by	,	who	knows	,	telling	jokes	,	storytelling	,	dancing	,	or	hairstyling	.
yes	,	hairstyling	--	i	insist	on	that	.
for	us	moderns	,	virtuoso	technique	is	used	to	create	imaginary	worlds	in	fiction	and	in	movies	,	to	express	intense	emotions	with	music	,	painting	and	dance	.
but	still	,	one	fundamental	trait	of	the	ancestral	personality	persists	in	our	aesthetic	cravings	:	the	beauty	we	find	in	skilled	performances	.
from	lascaux	to	the	louvre	to	carnegie	hall	,	human	beings	have	a	permanent	innate	taste	for	virtuoso	displays	in	the	arts	.
we	find	beauty	in	something	done	well	.
so	the	next	time	you	pass	a	jewelry	shop	window	displaying	a	beautifully	cut	teardrop	-	shaped	stone	,	do	n't	be	so	sure	it	's	just	your	culture	telling	you	that	that	sparkling	jewel	is	beautiful	.
your	distant	ancestors	loved	that	shape	and	found	beauty	in	the	skill	needed	to	make	it	,	even	before	they	could	put	their	love	into	words	.
is	beauty	in	the	eye	of	the	beholder	?
no	,	it	's	deep	in	our	minds	.
it	's	a	gift	handed	down	from	the	intelligent	skills	and	rich	emotional	lives	of	our	most	ancient	ancestors	.
our	powerful	reaction	to	images	,	to	the	expression	of	emotion	in	art	,	to	the	beauty	of	music	,	to	the	night	sky	,	will	be	with	us	and	our	descendants	for	as	long	as	the	human	race	exists	.
