there	's	currently	over	a	thousand	tedtalks	on	the	ted	website	.
and	i	guess	many	of	you	here	think	that	this	is	quite	fantastic	--	except	for	me	.	i	do	n't	agree	with	this	.
i	think	we	have	a	situation	here	.
because	if	you	think	about	it	,	1,000	tedtalks	,	that	's	over	1,000	ideas	worth	spreading	.
how	on	earth	are	you	going	to	spread	a	thousand	ideas	?
even	if	you	just	try	to	get	all	of	those	ideas	into	your	head	by	watching	all	those	thousand	ted	videos	,	it	would	actually	currently	take	you	over	250	hours	to	do	so	.
and	i	did	a	little	calculation	of	this	.
the	damage	to	the	economy	for	each	one	who	does	this	is	around	$	15,000	.
so	having	seen	this	danger	to	the	economy	,	i	thought	,	we	need	to	find	a	solution	to	this	problem	.
here	's	my	approach	to	it	all	.
if	you	look	at	the	current	situation	,	you	have	a	thousand	tedtalks	.
each	of	those	tedtalks	has	an	average	length	of	about	2,300	words	.
now	take	this	together	and	you	end	up	with	2.3	million	words	of	tedtalks	,	which	is	about	three	bibles	-	worth	of	content	.
the	obvious	question	here	is	,	does	a	tedtalk	really	need	2,300	words	?
is	n't	there	something	shorter	?
i	mean	,	if	you	have	an	idea	worth	spreading	,	surely	you	can	put	it	into	something	shorter	than	2,300	words	.
the	only	question	is	,	how	short	can	you	get	?
what	's	the	minimum	amount	of	words	you	would	need	to	do	a	tedtalk	?
while	i	was	pondering	this	question	,	i	came	across	this	urban	legend	about	ernest	hemingway	,	who	allegedly	said	that	these	six	words	here	:	``	for	sale	:	baby	shoes	,	never	worn	,	``	were	the	best	novel	he	had	ever	written	.
and	i	also	encountered	a	project	called	six	-	word	memoirs	where	people	were	asked	,	take	your	whole	life	and	please	sum	this	up	into	six	words	,	such	as	these	here	:	``	found	true	love	,	married	someone	else	.	``	or	``	living	in	existential	vacuum	;	it	sucks	.	``	i	actually	like	that	one	.
so	if	a	novel	can	be	put	into	six	words	and	a	whole	memoir	can	be	put	into	six	words	,	you	do	n't	need	more	than	six	words	for	a	tedtalk	.
we	could	have	been	done	by	lunch	here	.
i	mean	...
and	if	you	did	this	for	all	thousand	tedtalks	,	you	would	get	from	2.3	million	words	down	to	6,000	.
so	i	thought	this	was	quite	worthwhile	.
so	i	started	asking	all	my	friends	,	please	take	your	favorite	tedtalk	and	put	that	into	six	words	.
so	here	are	some	of	the	results	that	i	received	.	i	think	they	're	quite	nice	.
for	example	,	dan	pink	's	talk	on	motivation	,	which	was	pretty	good	if	you	have	n't	seen	it	:	``	drop	carrot	.	drop	stick	.	bring	meaning	.	``	it	's	what	he	's	basically	talking	about	in	those	18	and	a	half	minutes	.
or	some	even	included	references	to	the	speakers	,	such	as	nathan	myhrvold	's	speaking	style	,	or	the	one	of	tim	ferriss	,	which	might	be	considered	a	bit	strenuous	at	times	.
the	challenge	here	is	,	if	i	try	to	systematically	do	this	,	i	would	probably	end	up	with	a	lot	of	summaries	,	but	not	with	many	friends	in	the	end	.
so	i	had	to	find	a	different	method	,	preferably	involving	total	strangers	.
and	luckily	there	's	a	website	for	that	called	mechanical	turk	,	which	is	a	website	where	you	can	post	tasks	that	you	do	n't	want	to	do	yourself	,	such	as	``	please	summarize	this	text	for	me	in	six	words	.	``
and	i	did	n't	allow	any	low	-	cost	countries	to	work	on	this	,	but	i	found	out	i	could	get	a	six	-	word	summary	for	just	10	cents	,	which	i	think	is	a	pretty	good	price	.
even	then	,	unfortunately	,	it	's	not	possible	to	summarize	each	tedtalk	individually	.
because	if	you	do	the	math	,	you	have	a	thousand	tedtalks	,	the	pay	10	cents	each	;	you	have	to	do	more	than	one	summary	for	each	of	those	talks	,	because	some	of	them	will	probably	be	,	or	are	,	really	bad	.
so	i	would	end	up	paying	hundreds	of	dollars	.
so	i	thought	of	a	different	way	by	thinking	,	well	,	the	talks	revolve	around	certain	themes	.
so	what	if	i	do	n't	let	people	summarize	individual	tedtalks	to	six	words	,	but	give	them	10	tedtalks	at	the	same	time	and	say	,	``	please	do	a	six	-	word	summary	for	that	one	.	``	i	would	cut	my	costs	by	90	percent	.
so	for	$	60	,	i	could	summarize	a	thousand	tedtalks	into	just	600	summaries	,	which	would	actually	be	quite	nice	.
now	some	of	you	might	actually	right	now	be	thinking	,	it	's	downright	crazy	to	have	10	tedtalks	summarized	into	just	six	words	.
but	it	's	actually	not	,	because	there	's	an	example	by	statistics	professor	,	hans	rosling	.
i	guess	many	of	you	have	seen	one	or	more	of	his	talks	.
he	's	got	eight	talks	online	,	and	those	talks	can	basically	be	summed	up	into	just	four	words	,	because	that	's	all	he	's	basically	showing	us	,	our	intuition	is	really	bad	.
he	always	proves	us	wrong	.
so	people	on	the	internet	,	some	did	n't	do	so	well	.
i	mean	,	when	i	asked	them	to	summarize	the	10	tedtalks	at	the	same	time	,	some	took	the	easy	route	out	.
they	just	had	some	general	comment	.
there	were	others	,	and	i	found	this	quite	cheeky	.	they	used	their	six	words	to	talk	back	to	me	and	ask	me	if	i	'd	been	too	much	on	google	lately	.
and	finally	also	,	i	never	understood	this	,	some	people	really	came	up	with	their	own	version	of	the	truth	.
i	do	n't	know	any	tedtalk	that	contains	this	.
but	,	oh	well	.	in	the	end	,	however	,	and	this	is	really	amazing	,	for	each	of	those	10	tedtalk	clusters	that	i	submitted	,	i	actually	received	meaningful	summaries	.
here	are	some	of	my	favorites	.
for	example	,	for	all	the	tedtalks	around	food	,	someone	summed	this	up	into	:	``	food	shaping	body	,	brains	and	environment	,	``	which	i	think	is	pretty	good	.
or	happiness	:	``	striving	toward	happiness	=	moving	toward	unhappiness	.	``
so	here	i	was	.
i	had	started	out	with	a	thousand	tedtalks	and	i	had	600	six	-	word	summaries	for	those	.
actually	it	sounded	nice	in	the	beginning	,	but	when	you	look	at	600	summaries	,	it	's	quite	a	lot	.
it	's	a	huge	list	.
so	i	thought	,	i	probably	have	to	take	this	one	step	further	here	and	create	summaries	of	the	summaries	--	and	this	is	exactly	what	i	did	.
so	i	took	the	600	summaries	that	i	had	,	put	them	into	nine	groups	according	to	the	ratings	that	the	talks	had	originally	received	on	ted.com	and	asked	people	to	do	summaries	of	those	.
again	,	there	were	some	misunderstandings	.
for	example	,	when	i	had	a	cluster	of	all	the	beautiful	talks	,	someone	thought	i	was	just	trying	to	find	the	ultimate	pick	-	up	line	.
but	in	the	end	,	amazingly	,	again	,	people	were	able	to	do	it	.
for	example	,	all	the	courageous	tedtalks	:	``	people	dying	,	``	or	``	people	suffering	,	``	was	also	one	,	``	with	easy	solutions	around	.	``
or	the	recipe	for	the	ultimate	jaw	-	dropping	tedtalk	:	``	flickr	photos	of	intergalactic	classical	composer	.	``
i	mean	that	's	the	essence	of	it	all	.
now	i	had	my	nine	groups	,	but	,	i	mean	,	it	's	already	quite	a	reduction	.
but	of	course	,	once	you	are	that	far	,	you	're	not	really	satisfied	.
i	wanted	to	go	all	the	way	,	all	the	way	down	the	distillery	,	starting	out	with	a	thousand	tedtalks	.
i	wanted	to	have	a	thousand	tedtalks	summarized	into	just	six	words	--	which	would	be	a	99.9997	percent	reduction	in	content	.
and	i	would	only	pay	$	99.50	--	so	stay	even	below	a	hundred	dollars	for	it	.
so	i	had	50	overall	summaries	done	.
this	time	i	paid	25	cents	because	i	thought	the	task	was	a	bit	harder	.
and	unfortunately	when	i	first	received	the	answers	--	and	here	you	'll	see	six	of	the	answers	--	i	was	a	bit	disappointed	.
because	i	think	you	'll	agree	,	they	all	summarize	some	aspect	of	ted	,	but	to	me	they	felt	a	bit	bland	,	or	they	just	had	a	certain	aspect	of	ted	in	them	.
so	i	was	almost	ready	to	give	up	when	one	night	i	played	around	with	these	sentences	and	found	out	that	there	's	actually	a	beautiful	solution	in	here	.
so	here	it	is	,	a	crowd	-	sourced	,	six	-	word	summary	of	a	thousand	tedtalks	at	the	value	of	$	99.50	:	``	why	the	worry	?	i	'd	rather	wonder	.	``	thank	you	very	much	.
