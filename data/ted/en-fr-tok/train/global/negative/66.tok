good	morning	.	how	are	you	?	it	's	been	great	,	has	n't	it	?
i	've	been	blown	away	by	the	whole	thing	.
in	fact	,	i	'm	leaving	.
there	have	been	three	themes	,	have	n't	there	,	running	through	the	conference	,	which	are	relevant	to	what	i	want	to	talk	about	.
one	is	the	extraordinary	evidence	of	human	creativity	in	all	of	the	presentations	that	we	've	had	and	in	all	of	the	people	here	.	just	the	variety	of	it	and	the	range	of	it	.	the	second	is	that	it	's	put	us	in	a	place	where	we	have	no	idea	what	's	going	to	happen	,	in	terms	of	the	future	.	no	idea	how	this	may	play	out	.
i	have	an	interest	in	education	--	actually	,	what	i	find	is	everybody	has	an	interest	in	education	.
do	n't	you	?	i	find	this	very	interesting	.
if	you	're	at	a	dinner	party	,	and	you	say	you	work	in	education	--	actually	,	you	're	not	often	at	dinner	parties	,	frankly	,	if	you	work	in	education	.
you	're	not	asked	.
and	you	're	never	asked	back	,	curiously	.	that	's	strange	to	me	.
but	if	you	are	,	and	you	say	to	somebody	,	you	know	,	they	say	,	``	what	do	you	do	?	``
and	you	say	you	work	in	education	,	you	can	see	the	blood	run	from	their	face	.	they	're	like	,	``	oh	my	god	,	``	you	know	,	``	why	me	?	my	one	night	out	all	week	.	``
but	if	you	ask	about	their	education	,	they	pin	you	to	the	wall	.	because	it	's	one	of	those	things	that	goes	deep	with	people	,	am	i	right	?
like	religion	,	and	money	and	other	things	.
i	have	a	big	interest	in	education	,	and	i	think	we	all	do	.
we	have	a	huge	vested	interest	in	it	,	partly	because	it	's	education	that	's	meant	to	take	us	into	this	future	that	we	ca	n't	grasp	.
if	you	think	of	it	,	children	starting	school	this	year	will	be	retiring	in	2065	.	nobody	has	a	clue	--	despite	all	the	expertise	that	's	been	on	parade	for	the	past	four	days	--	what	the	world	will	look	like	in	five	years	'	time	.	and	yet	we	're	meant	to	be	educating	them	for	it	.	so	the	unpredictability	,	i	think	,	is	extraordinary	.
and	the	third	part	of	this	is	that	we	've	all	agreed	,	nonetheless	,	on	the	really	extraordinary	capacities	that	children	have	--	their	capacities	for	innovation	.	i	mean	,	sirena	last	night	was	a	marvel	,	was	n't	she	?	just	seeing	what	she	could	do	.
and	she	's	exceptional	,	but	i	think	she	's	not	,	so	to	speak	,	exceptional	in	the	whole	of	childhood	.
what	you	have	there	is	a	person	of	extraordinary	dedication	who	found	a	talent	.	and	my	contention	is	,	all	kids	have	tremendous	talents	.
and	we	squander	them	,	pretty	ruthlessly	.
so	i	want	to	talk	about	education	and	i	want	to	talk	about	creativity	.	my	contention	is	that	creativity	now	is	as	important	in	education	as	literacy	,	and	we	should	treat	it	with	the	same	status	.
thank	you	.	that	was	it	,	by	the	way	.
thank	you	very	much	.	so	,	15	minutes	left	.
well	,	i	was	born	...	no	.
i	heard	a	great	story	recently	--	i	love	telling	it	--	of	a	little	girl	who	was	in	a	drawing	lesson	.	she	was	six	and	she	was	at	the	back	,	drawing	,	and	the	teacher	said	this	little	girl	hardly	ever	paid	attention	,	and	in	this	drawing	lesson	she	did	.
the	teacher	was	fascinated	and	she	went	over	to	her	and	she	said	,	``	what	are	you	drawing	?	``
and	the	girl	said	,	``	i	'm	drawing	a	picture	of	god	.	``
and	the	teacher	said	,	``	but	nobody	knows	what	god	looks	like	.	``
and	the	girl	said	,	``	they	will	in	a	minute	.	``
when	my	son	was	four	in	england	--	actually	he	was	four	everywhere	,	to	be	honest	.
if	we	're	being	strict	about	it	,	wherever	he	went	,	he	was	four	that	year	.
he	was	in	the	nativity	play	.
do	you	remember	the	story	?	no	,	it	was	big	.
it	was	a	big	story	.	mel	gibson	did	the	sequel	.
you	may	have	seen	it	:	``	nativity	ii	.	``	but	james	got	the	part	of	joseph	,	which	we	were	thrilled	about	.
we	considered	this	to	be	one	of	the	lead	parts	.
we	had	the	place	crammed	full	of	agents	in	t	-	shirts	:	``	james	robinson	is	joseph	!	``
he	did	n't	have	to	speak	,	but	you	know	the	bit	where	the	three	kings	come	in	.	they	come	in	bearing	gifts	,	and	they	bring	gold	,	frankincense	and	myrhh	.
this	really	happened	.	we	were	sitting	there	and	i	think	they	just	went	out	of	sequence	,	because	we	talked	to	the	little	boy	afterward	and	we	said	,	``	you	ok	with	that	?	``	and	he	said	,	``	yeah	,	why	?	was	that	wrong	?	``
they	just	switched	,	that	was	it	.
anyway	,	the	three	boys	came	in	--	four	-	year	-	olds	with	tea	towels	on	their	heads	--	and	they	put	these	boxes	down	,	and	the	first	boy	said	,	``	i	bring	you	gold	.	``
and	the	second	boy	said	,	``	i	bring	you	myrhh	.	``
and	the	third	boy	said	,	``	frank	sent	this	.	``	what	these	things	have	in	common	is	that	kids	will	take	a	chance	.
if	they	do	n't	know	,	they	'll	have	a	go	.
am	i	right	?	they	're	not	frightened	of	being	wrong	.
now	,	i	do	n't	mean	to	say	that	being	wrong	is	the	same	thing	as	being	creative	.
what	we	do	know	is	,	if	you	're	not	prepared	to	be	wrong	,	you	'll	never	come	up	with	anything	original	--
if	you	're	not	prepared	to	be	wrong	.	and	by	the	time	they	get	to	be	adults	,	most	kids	have	lost	that	capacity	.
they	have	become	frightened	of	being	wrong	.
and	we	run	our	companies	like	this	,	by	the	way	.
we	stigmatize	mistakes	.	and	we	're	now	running	national	education	systems	where	mistakes	are	the	worst	thing	you	can	make	.
and	the	result	is	that	we	are	educating	people	out	of	their	creative	capacities	.	picasso	once	said	this	--	he	said	that	all	children	are	born	artists	.
the	problem	is	to	remain	an	artist	as	we	grow	up	.	i	believe	this	passionately	,	that	we	do	n't	grow	into	creativity	,
we	grow	out	of	it	.	or	rather	,	we	get	educated	out	if	it	.
so	why	is	this	?
i	lived	in	stratford	-	on	-	avon	until	about	five	years	ago	.
in	fact	,	we	moved	from	stratford	to	los	angeles	.
so	you	can	imagine	what	a	seamless	transition	that	was	.
actually	,	we	lived	in	a	place	called	snitterfield	,	just	outside	stratford	,	which	is	where	shakespeare	's	father	was	born	.	are	you	struck	by	a	new	thought	?	i	was	.
you	do	n't	think	of	shakespeare	having	a	father	,	do	you	?
do	you	?	because	you	do	n't	think	of	shakespeare	being	a	child	,	do	you	?
shakespeare	being	seven	?	i	never	thought	of	it	.	i	mean	,	he	was	seven	at	some	point	.	he	was	in	somebody	's	english	class	,	was	n't	he	?	how	annoying	would	that	be	?
``	must	try	harder	.	``	being	sent	to	bed	by	his	dad	,	you	know	,	to	shakespeare	,	``	go	to	bed	,	now	,	``
to	william	shakespeare	,	``	and	put	the	pencil	down	.
and	stop	speaking	like	that	.	it	's	confusing	everybody	.	``
anyway	,	we	moved	from	stratford	to	los	angeles	,	and	i	just	want	to	say	a	word	about	the	transition	,	actually	.
my	son	did	n't	want	to	come	.
i	've	got	two	kids	.	he	's	21	now	;	my	daughter	's	16	.
he	did	n't	want	to	come	to	los	angeles	.	he	loved	it	,	but	he	had	a	girlfriend	in	england	.	this	was	the	love	of	his	life	,	sarah	.
he	'd	known	her	for	a	month	.
mind	you	,	they	'd	had	their	fourth	anniversary	,	because	it	's	a	long	time	when	you	're	16	.
anyway	,	he	was	really	upset	on	the	plane	,	and	he	said	,	``	i	'll	never	find	another	girl	like	sarah	.	``
and	we	were	rather	pleased	about	that	,	frankly	,	because	she	was	the	main	reason	we	were	leaving	the	country	.
but	something	strikes	you	when	you	move	to	america	and	when	you	travel	around	the	world	:	every	education	system	on	earth	has	the	same	hierarchy	of	subjects	.
every	one	.	does	n't	matter	where	you	go	.
you	'd	think	it	would	be	otherwise	,	but	it	is	n't	.
at	the	top	are	mathematics	and	languages	,	then	the	humanities	,	and	the	bottom	are	the	arts	.
everywhere	on	earth	.
and	in	pretty	much	every	system	too	,	there	's	a	hierarchy	within	the	arts	.
art	and	music	are	normally	given	a	higher	status	in	schools	than	drama	and	dance	.	there	is	n't	an	education	system	on	the	planet	that	teaches	dance	everyday	to	children	the	way	we	teach	them	mathematics	.	why	?
why	not	?	i	think	this	is	rather	important	.
i	think	math	is	very	important	,	but	so	is	dance	.
children	dance	all	the	time	if	they	're	allowed	to	,	we	all	do	.
we	all	have	bodies	,	do	n't	we	?	did	i	miss	a	meeting	?
truthfully	,	what	happens	is	,	as	children	grow	up	,	we	start	to	educate	them	progressively	from	the	waist	up	.	and	then	we	focus	on	their	heads	.
and	slightly	to	one	side	.
if	you	were	to	visit	education	,	as	an	alien	,	and	say	``	what	's	it	for	,	public	education	?	``
i	think	you	'd	have	to	conclude	--	if	you	look	at	the	output	,	who	really	succeeds	by	this	,	who	does	everything	that	they	should	,	who	gets	all	the	brownie	points	,	who	are	the	winners	--	i	think	you	'd	have	to	conclude	the	whole	purpose	of	public	education	throughout	the	world	is	to	produce	university	professors	.	is	n't	it	?
they	're	the	people	who	come	out	the	top	.
and	i	used	to	be	one	,	so	there	.
and	i	like	university	professors	,	but	you	know	,	we	should	n't	hold	them	up	as	the	high	-	water	mark	of	all	human	achievement	.
they	're	just	a	form	of	life	,	another	form	of	life	.	but	they	're	rather	curious	,	and	i	say	this	out	of	affection	for	them	.
there	's	something	curious	about	professors	in	my	experience	--	not	all	of	them	,	but	typically	--	they	live	in	their	heads	.
they	live	up	there	,	and	slightly	to	one	side	.
they	're	disembodied	,	you	know	,	in	a	kind	of	literal	way	.
they	look	upon	their	body	as	a	form	of	transport	for	their	heads	,	do	n't	they	?
it	's	a	way	of	getting	their	head	to	meetings	.
if	you	want	real	evidence	of	out	-	of	-	body	experiences	,	by	the	way	,	get	yourself	along	to	a	residential	conference	of	senior	academics	,	and	pop	into	the	discotheque	on	the	final	night	.
and	there	you	will	see	it	--	grown	men	and	women	writhing	uncontrollably	,	off	the	beat	,	waiting	until	it	ends	so	they	can	go	home	and	write	a	paper	about	it	.
now	our	education	system	is	predicated	on	the	idea	of	academic	ability	.
and	there	's	a	reason	.
the	whole	system	was	invented	--	around	the	world	,	there	were	no	public	systems	of	education	,	really	,	before	the	19th	century	.
they	all	came	into	being	to	meet	the	needs	of	industrialism	.
so	the	hierarchy	is	rooted	on	two	ideas	.
number	one	,	that	the	most	useful	subjects	for	work	are	at	the	top	.	so	you	were	probably	steered	benignly	away	from	things	at	school	when	you	were	a	kid	,	things	you	liked	,	on	the	grounds	that	you	would	never	get	a	job	doing	that	.	is	that	right	?
do	n't	do	music	,	you	're	not	going	to	be	a	musician	;	do	n't	do	art	,	you	wo	n't	be	an	artist	.
benign	advice	--	now	,	profoundly	mistaken	.	the	whole	world	is	engulfed	in	a	revolution	.
and	the	second	is	academic	ability	,	which	has	really	come	to	dominate	our	view	of	intelligence	,	because	the	universities	designed	the	system	in	their	image	.
if	you	think	of	it	,	the	whole	system	of	public	education	around	the	world	is	a	protracted	process	of	university	entrance	.
and	the	consequence	is	that	many	highly	talented	,	brilliant	,	creative	people	think	they	're	not	,	because	the	thing	they	were	good	at	at	school	was	n't	valued	,	or	was	actually	stigmatized	.
and	i	think	we	ca	n't	afford	to	go	on	that	way	.
in	the	next	30	years	,	according	to	unesco	,	more	people	worldwide	will	be	graduating	through	education	than	since	the	beginning	of	history	.
more	people	,	and	it	's	the	combination	of	all	the	things	we	've	talked	about	--	technology	and	its	transformation	effect	on	work	,	and	demography	and	the	huge	explosion	in	population	.
suddenly	,	degrees	are	n't	worth	anything	.	is	n't	that	true	?
when	i	was	a	student	,	if	you	had	a	degree	,	you	had	a	job	.
if	you	did	n't	have	a	job	it	's	because	you	did	n't	want	one	.
and	i	did	n't	want	one	,	frankly	.
but	now	kids	with	degrees	are	often	heading	home	to	carry	on	playing	video	games	,	because	you	need	an	ma	where	the	previous	job	required	a	ba	,	and	now	you	need	a	phd	for	the	other	.
it	's	a	process	of	academic	inflation	.
and	it	indicates	the	whole	structure	of	education	is	shifting	beneath	our	feet	.	we	need	to	radically	rethink	our	view	of	intelligence	.
we	know	three	things	about	intelligence	.
one	,	it	's	diverse	.	we	think	about	the	world	in	all	the	ways	that	we	experience	it	.	we	think	visually	,	we	think	in	sound	,	we	think	kinesthetically	.	we	think	in	abstract	terms	,	we	think	in	movement	.
secondly	,	intelligence	is	dynamic	.
if	you	look	at	the	interactions	of	a	human	brain	,	as	we	heard	yesterday	from	a	number	of	presentations	,	intelligence	is	wonderfully	interactive	.
the	brain	is	n't	divided	into	compartments	.
in	fact	,	creativity	--	which	i	define	as	the	process	of	having	original	ideas	that	have	value	--	more	often	than	not	comes	about	through	the	interaction	of	different	disciplinary	ways	of	seeing	things	.
the	brain	is	intentionally	--	by	the	way	,	there	's	a	shaft	of	nerves	that	joins	the	two	halves	of	the	brain	called	the	corpus	callosum	.	it	's	thicker	in	women	.
following	off	from	helen	yesterday	,	i	think	this	is	probably	why	women	are	better	at	multi	-	tasking	.
because	you	are	,	are	n't	you	?
there	's	a	raft	of	research	,	but	i	know	it	from	my	personal	life	.
if	my	wife	is	cooking	a	meal	at	home	--	which	is	not	often	,	thankfully	.
but	you	know	,	she	's	doing	--	no	,	she	's	good	at	some	things	--	but	if	she	's	cooking	,	you	know	,	she	's	dealing	with	people	on	the	phone	,	she	's	talking	to	the	kids	,	she	's	painting	the	ceiling	,	she	's	doing	open	-	heart	surgery	over	here	.
if	i	'm	cooking	,	the	door	is	shut	,	the	kids	are	out	,	the	phone	's	on	the	hook	,	if	she	comes	in	i	get	annoyed	.
i	say	,	``	terry	,	please	,	i	'm	trying	to	fry	an	egg	in	here	.	give	me	a	break	.	``
actually	,	you	know	that	old	philosophical	thing	,	if	a	tree	falls	in	a	forest	and	nobody	hears	it	,	did	it	happen	?	remember	that	old	chestnut	?
i	saw	a	great	t	-	shirt	really	recently	which	said	,	``	if	a	man	speaks	his	mind	in	a	forest	,	and	no	woman	hears	him	,	is	he	still	wrong	?	``
and	the	third	thing	about	intelligence	is	,	it	's	distinct	.	i	'm	doing	a	new	book	at	the	moment	called	``	epiphany	,	``	which	is	based	on	a	series	of	interviews	with	people	about	how	they	discovered
their	talent	.	i	'm	fascinated	by	how	people	got	to	be	there	.
it	's	really	prompted	by	a	conversation	i	had	with	a	wonderful	woman	who	maybe	most	people	have	never	heard	of	;	she	's	called	gillian	lynne	--	have	you	heard	of	her	?	some	have	.	she	's	a	choreographer	and	everybody	knows	her	work	.
she	did	``	cats	``	and	``	phantom	of	the	opera	.	``	she	's	wonderful	.	i	used	to	be	on	the	board	of	the	royal	ballet	in	england	,	as	you	can	see	.
anyway	,	gillian	and	i	had	lunch	one	day	and	i	said	,	``	gillian	,	how	'd	you	get	to	be	a	dancer	?	``	and	she	said	it	was	interesting	;	when	she	was	at	school	,	she	was	really	hopeless	.	and	the	school	,	in	the	'30s	,	wrote	to	her	parents	and	said	,	``	we	think	gillian	has	a	learning	disorder	.	``	she	could	n't	concentrate	;	she	was	fidgeting	.	i	think	now	they	'd	say	she	had	adhd	.	would	n't	you	?	but	this	was	the	1930s	,	and	adhd	had	n't	been	invented	at	this	point	.
it	was	n't	an	available	condition	.
people	were	n't	aware	they	could	have	that	.
anyway	,	she	went	to	see	this	specialist	.	so	,	this	oak	-	paneled	room	,
and	she	was	there	with	her	mother	,	and	she	was	led	and	sat	on	this	chair	at	the	end	,	and	she	sat	on	her	hands	for	20	minutes	while	this	man	talked	to	her	mother	about	all	the	problems	gillian	was	having	at	school	.	and	at	the	end	of	it	--	because	she	was	disturbing	people	;	her	homework	was	always	late	;	and	so	on	,	little	kid	of	eight	--	in	the	end	,	the	doctor	went	and	sat	next	to	gillian	and	said	,	``	gillian	,	i	've	listened	to	all	these	things	that	your	mother	's	told	me	,	and	i	need	to	speak	to	her	privately	.	``	he	said	,	``	wait	here	.	we	'll	be	back	;	we	wo	n't	be	very	long	,	``
and	they	went	and	left	her	.
but	as	they	went	out	the	room	,	he	turned	on	the	radio	that	was	sitting	on	his	desk	.	and	when	they	got	out	the	room	,	he	said	to	her	mother	,	``	just	stand	and	watch	her	.	``	and	the	minute	they	left	the	room	,	she	said	,	she	was	on	her	feet	,	moving	to	the	music	.
and	they	watched	for	a	few	minutes	and	he	turned	to	her	mother	and	said	,	``	mrs.	lynne	,	gillian	is	n't	sick	;	she	's	a	dancer	.
take	her	to	a	dance	school	.	``
i	said	,	``	what	happened	?	``
she	said	,	``	she	did	.	i	ca	n't	tell	you	how	wonderful	it	was	.
we	walked	in	this	room	and	it	was	full	of	people	like	me	.	people	who	could	n't	sit	still	.	people	who	had	to	move	to	think	.	``	who	had	to	move	to	think	.
they	did	ballet	;	they	did	tap	;	they	did	jazz	;	they	did	modern	;	they	did	contemporary	.
she	was	eventually	auditioned	for	the	royal	ballet	school	;	she	became	a	soloist	;	she	had	a	wonderful	career	at	the	royal	ballet	.	she	eventually	graduated	from	the	royal	ballet	school	and	founded	her	own	company	--	the	gillian	lynne	dance	company	--	met	andrew	lloyd	weber	.	she	's	been	responsible	for	some	of	the	most	successful	musical	theater	productions	in	history	;	she	's	given	pleasure	to	millions	;	and	she	's	a	multi	-	millionaire	.	somebody	else	might	have	put	her	on	medication	and	told	her	to	calm	down	.
now	,	i	think	...	what	i	think	it	comes	to	is	this	:	al	gore	spoke	the	other	night	about	ecology	and	the	revolution	that	was	triggered	by	rachel	carson	.
i	believe	our	only	hope	for	the	future	is	to	adopt	a	new	conception	of	human	ecology	,	one	in	which	we	start	to	reconstitute	our	conception	of	the	richness	of	human	capacity	.
our	education	system	has	mined	our	minds	in	the	way	that	we	strip	-	mine	the	earth	:	for	a	particular	commodity	.
and	for	the	future	,	it	wo	n't	serve	us	.
we	have	to	rethink	the	fundamental	principles	on	which	we	're	educating	our	children	.	there	was	a	wonderful	quote	by	jonas	salk	,	who	said	,	``	if	all	the	insects	were	to	disappear	from	the	earth	,	within	50	years	all	life	on	earth	would	end	.
if	all	human	beings	disappeared	from	the	earth	,	within	50	years	all	forms	of	life	would	flourish	.	``
and	he	's	right	.
what	ted	celebrates	is	the	gift	of	the	human	imagination	.
we	have	to	be	careful	now	that	we	use	this	gift	wisely	and	that	we	avert	some	of	the	scenarios	that	we	've	talked	about	.	and	the	only	way	we	'll	do	it	is	by	seeing	our	creative	capacities	for	the	richness	they	are	and	seeing	our	children	for	the	hope	that	they	are	.	and	our	task	is	to	educate	their	whole	being	,	so	they	can	face	this	future	.
by	the	way	--	we	may	not	see	this	future	,	but	they	will	.	and	our	job	is	to	help	them	make	something	of	it	.	thank	you	very	much	.
