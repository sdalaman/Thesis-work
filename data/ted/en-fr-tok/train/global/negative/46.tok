thank	you	.
thank	you	very	much	.
like	the	speaker	before	me	,	i	am	--	that	's	the	ted	virgin	,	i	guess	--	i	'm	also	the	first	time	here	,	and	i	do	n't	know	what	to	say	.
i	'm	really	happy	that	mr.	anderson	invited	me	.
i	'm	really	grateful	that	i	get	a	chance	to	play	for	everyone	.
and	the	song	that	i	just	played	was	by	j√≥zef	hofmann	.
it	's	called	``	kaleidoscope	.	``
and	hofmann	is	a	polish	pianist	and	composer	of	the	late	19th	century	,
and	he	's	widely	considered	one	of	the	greatest	pianists	of	all	time	.
i	have	another	piece	that	i	'd	like	to	play	for	you	.
it	's	called	``	abegg	variations	,	``	by	robert	schumann	,	a	german	19th	century	composer	.
the	name	``	abegg	``	--	``	abegg	``	is	actually	a	-	b	-	e	-	g	-	g	,	and	that	's	the	main	theme	in	the	melody	.
that	comes	from	the	last	name	of	one	of	schumann	's	female	friends	.
but	he	wrote	that	for	his	wife	.
so	,	actually	,	if	you	listen	carefully	,	there	's	supposed	to	be	five	variations	on	this	abegg	theme	.
it	's	written	around	1834	,	so	,	even	though	it	's	old	,	i	hope	you	like	it	.
now	comes	the	part	that	i	hate	.
well	,	because	mr.	anderson	told	me	that	this	session	is	called	``	sync	and	flow	,	``	i	was	wondering	,	``	what	do	i	know	that	these	geniuses	do	n't	?	``
so	,	i	'll	talk	about	musical	composition	,	even	though	i	do	n't	know	where	to	start	.
how	do	i	compose	?
i	think	yamaha	does	a	really	good	job	of	teaching	us	how	to	compose	.
what	i	do	first	is	,	i	make	a	lot	of	little	musical	ideas	--	you	can	just	improvise	here	at	the	piano	--	and	i	choose	one	of	those	to	become	my	main	theme	,	my	main	melody	,	like	the	abegg	that	you	just	heard	.
and	once	i	choose	my	main	theme	i	have	to	decide	,	out	of	all	the	styles	in	music	,	what	kind	of	style	do	i	want	?
and	this	year	i	composed	a	romantic	style	.
so	,	for	inspiration	i	listened	to	liszt	and	tchaikovsky	and	all	the	great	romantic	composers	.
next	,	i	make	the	structure	of	the	entire	piece	with	my	teachers	.
they	help	me	plan	out	the	whole	piece	,	and	then	the	hard	part	is	filling	it	in	with	musical	ideas	,	because	then	you	have	to	think	.
and	then	,	when	the	piece	takes	somewhat	of	a	solified	form	--	solidified	,	excuse	me	--	solidified	form	,	you	're	supposed	to	actually	polish	the	piece	,	polish	the	details	,	and	then	polish	the	overall	performance	of	the	composition	.
and	another	thing	that	i	enjoy	doing	is	drawing	--	drawing	,	because	i	like	to	draw	,	you	know	,	japanese	anime	art	.
i	think	that	's	a	craze	among	teens	right	now	.
and	once	i	realized	it	,	there	's	a	parallel	between	creating	music	and	creating	art	,	because	for	your	motive	or	your	little	initial	idea	for	your	drawing	,	it	's	your	character	--	you	want	to	decide	who	do	you	want	to	draw	,	or	if	you	want	to	draw	an	original	character	.
and	then	you	want	to	decide	,	how	are	you	going	to	draw	the	character	?
like	,	am	i	going	to	use	one	page	?
am	i	going	to	draw	it	on	the	computer	?
am	i	going	to	use	a	two	-	page	spread	like	a	comic	book	for	more	grandiose	effect	,	i	guess	?
and	then	you	have	to	do	the	initial	sketch	of	the	character	,	which	is	like	your	structure	of	a	piece	,	and	then	you	add	pen	and	pencil	and	whatever	details	that	you	need	--	that	's	polishing	the	drawing	.
and	another	thing	that	both	of	these	have	in	common	is	your	state	of	mind	,	because	i	do	n't	--	i	'm	one	of	those	teenagers	that	are	really	easily	distracted	,	so	if	i	'm	trying	to	do	homework	,	if	i	'm	trying	to	do	homework	and	i	do	n't	feel	like	it	,	i	'll	try	to	draw	or	,	you	know	,	waste	my	time	.
and	then	what	happens	is	,	sometimes	i	absolutely	ca	n't	draw	or	i	ca	n't	compose	at	all	,	and	then	it	's	like	there	's	too	much	on	your	mind	.
you	ca	n't	focus	on	what	you	're	supposed	to	do	.
and	sometimes	,	if	you	manage	to	use	your	time	wisely	and	work	on	it	,	you	'll	get	something	out	of	it	,	but	it	does	n't	come	naturally	.
what	happens	is	,	if	something	magical	happens	,	if	something	natural	happens	to	you	,	you	're	able	to	produce	all	this	beautiful	stuff	instantly	,	and	then	that	's	what	i	consider	``	flow	,	``	because	that	's	when	everything	clicks	and	you	're	able	to	do	anything	.
you	feel	like	you	're	on	top	of	your	game	and	you	can	do	anything	you	want	.
i	'm	not	going	to	play	my	own	composition	today	because	,	although	i	did	finish	it	,	it	's	way	too	long	.
instead	,	i	'd	like	to	try	something	called	``	improvisation	.	``
i	have	here	seven	note	cards	,	one	with	each	note	of	the	musical	alphabet	,	and	i	'd	like	someone	to	come	up	here	and	choose	five	--
anyone	to	come	up	here	and	choose	five	--
and	then	i	can	make	it	into	some	sort	of	melody	and	i	'll	improvise	it	.
wow	,	a	volunteer	,	yay	!
nice	to	meet	you	.
goldie	hawn	:	thank	you	.	choose	five	?
jennifer	lin	:	yes	,	five	cards	.	any	five	cards	.
gh	:	ok	.	one	.	two	.	three	.
oh	,	d	and	f	--	too	familiar	.
jl	:	one	more	.
gh	:	ok	,	e	for	effort	.
jl	:	would	you	mind	reading	them	out	in	the	order	that	you	chose	them	?
gh	:	ok	.	c	,	g	,	b	,	a	and	e	.
jl	:	thank	you	very	much	.
gh	:	you	're	welcome	.	and	what	about	these	?
jl	:	i	wo	n't	use	them	.	thank	you	.
now	,	she	chose	c	,	g	,	b	,	a	,	e	.
i	'm	going	to	try	to	put	that	in	some	sort	of	order	.
ok	,	that	's	nice	.
so	,	i	'm	going	to	have	a	moment	to	think	,	and	i	'll	try	to	make	something	out	of	it	.
the	next	song	,	or	the	encore	,	that	i	'm	going	to	play	is	called	``	bumble	boogie	,	``	by	jack	fina	.
