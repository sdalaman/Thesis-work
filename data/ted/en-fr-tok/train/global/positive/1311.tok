i	've	been	in	afghanistan	for	21	years	.
i	work	for	the	red	cross	and	i	'm	a	physical	therapist	.
my	job	is	to	make	arms	and	legs	--	well	it	's	not	completely	true	.
we	do	more	than	that	.
we	provide	the	patients	,	the	afghan	disabled	,	first	with	the	physical	rehabilitation	then	with	the	social	reintegration	.
it	's	a	very	logical	plan	,	but	it	was	not	always	like	this	.
for	many	years	,	we	were	just	providing	them	with	artificial	limbs	.
it	took	quite	many	years	for	the	program	to	become	what	it	is	now	.
today	,	i	would	like	to	tell	you	a	story	,	the	story	of	a	big	change	,	and	the	story	of	the	people	who	made	this	change	possible	.
i	arrived	in	afghanistan	in	1990	to	work	in	a	hospital	for	war	victims	.
and	then	,	not	only	for	war	victims	,	but	it	was	for	any	kind	of	patient	.
i	was	also	working	in	the	orthopedic	center	,	we	call	it	.
this	is	the	place	where	we	make	the	legs	.
at	that	time	i	found	myself	in	a	strange	situation	.
i	felt	not	quite	ready	for	that	job	.
there	was	so	much	to	learn	.
there	were	so	many	things	new	to	me	.
but	it	was	a	terrific	job	.
but	as	soon	as	the	fighting	intensified	,	the	physical	rehabilitation	was	suspended	.
there	were	many	other	things	to	do	.
so	the	orthopedic	center	was	closed	because	physical	rehabilitation	was	not	considered	a	priority	.
it	was	a	strange	sensation	.
anyway	,	you	know	every	time	i	make	this	speech	--	it	's	not	the	first	time	--	but	it	's	an	emotion	.
it	's	something	that	comes	out	from	the	past	.
it	's	21	years	,	but	they	are	still	all	there	.
anyway	,	in	1992	,	the	mujahideen	took	all	afghanistan	.
and	the	orthopedic	center	was	closed	.
i	was	assigned	to	work	for	the	homeless	,	for	the	internally	displaced	people	.
but	one	day	,	something	happened	.
i	was	coming	back	from	a	big	food	distribution	in	a	mosque	where	tens	and	tens	of	people	were	squatting	in	terrible	conditions	.
i	wanted	to	go	home	.	i	was	driving	.
you	know	,	when	you	want	to	forget	,	you	do	n't	want	to	see	things	,	so	you	just	want	to	go	to	your	room	,	to	lock	yourself	inside	and	say	,	``	that	's	enough	.	``
a	bomb	fell	not	far	from	my	car	--	well	,	far	enough	,	but	big	noise	.
and	everybody	disappeared	from	the	street	.
the	cars	disappeared	as	well	.
i	ducked	.
and	only	one	figure	remained	in	the	middle	of	the	road	.
it	was	a	man	in	a	wheelchair	desperately	trying	to	move	away	.
well	i	'm	not	a	particularly	brave	person	,	i	have	to	confess	it	,	but	i	could	not	just	ignore	him	.
so	i	stopped	the	car	and	i	went	to	help	.
the	man	was	without	legs	and	only	with	one	arm	.
behind	him	there	was	a	child	,	his	son	,	red	in	the	face	in	an	effort	to	push	the	father	.
so	i	took	him	into	a	safe	place	.
and	i	ask	,	``	what	are	you	doing	out	in	the	street	in	this	situation	?	``	``	i	work	,	``	he	said	.
i	wondered	,	what	work	?
and	then	i	ask	an	even	more	stupid	question	:	``	why	do	n't	you	have	the	prostheses	?
why	do	n't	you	have	the	artificial	legs	?	``	and	he	said	,	``	the	red	cross	has	closed	.	``	well	without	thinking	,	i	told	him	``	come	tomorrow	.
we	will	provide	you	with	a	pair	of	legs	.	``	the	man	,	his	name	was	mahmoud	,	and	the	child	,	whose	name	was	rafi	,	left	.
and	then	i	said	,	``	oh	,	my	god	.	what	did	i	say	?
the	center	is	closed	,	no	staff	around	.
maybe	the	machinery	is	broken	.
who	is	going	to	make	the	legs	for	him	?	``	so	i	hoped	that	he	would	not	come	.
this	is	the	streets	of	kabul	in	those	days	.
so	i	said	,	``	well	i	will	give	him	some	money	.	``	and	so	the	following	day	,	i	went	to	the	orthopedic	center	.
and	i	spoke	with	a	gatekeeper	.
i	was	ready	to	tell	him	,	``	listen	,	if	someone	such	-	and	-	such	comes	tomorrow	,	please	tell	him	that	it	was	a	mistake	.
nothing	can	be	done	.
give	him	some	money	.	``	but	mahmoud	and	his	son	were	already	there	.
and	they	were	not	alone	.
there	were	15	,	maybe	20	,	people	like	him	waiting	.
and	there	was	some	staff	too	.
among	them	there	was	my	right	-	hand	man	,	najmuddin	.
and	the	gatekeeper	told	me	,	``	they	come	everyday	to	see	if	the	center	will	open	.	``	i	said	,	``	no	.
we	have	to	go	away	.	we	can	not	stay	here	.	``	they	were	bombing	--	not	very	close	--	but	you	could	hear	the	noise	of	the	bombs	.
so	,	``	we	can	not	stay	here	,	it	's	dangerous	.
it	's	not	a	priority	.	``	but	najmuddin	told	me	,	``	listen	now	,	we	're	here	.	``	at	least	we	can	start	repairing	the	prostheses	,	the	broken	prostheses	of	the	people	and	maybe	try	to	do	something	for	people	like	mahmoud	.	``
i	said	,	``	no	,	please	.	we	can	not	do	that	.
it	's	really	dangerous	.
we	have	other	things	to	do	.	``	but	they	insisted	.
when	you	have	20	people	in	front	of	you	,	looking	at	you	and	you	are	the	one	who	has	to	decide	...
so	we	started	doing	some	repairs	.
also	one	of	the	physical	therapists	reported	that	mahmoud	could	be	provided	with	a	leg	,	but	not	immediately	.
the	legs	were	swollen	and	the	knees	were	stiff	,	so	he	needed	a	long	preparation	.
believe	me	,	i	was	worried	because	i	was	breaking	the	rules	.
i	was	doing	something	that	i	was	not	supposed	to	do	.
in	the	evening	,	i	went	to	speak	with	the	bosses	at	the	headquarters	,	and	i	told	them	--	i	lied	--	i	told	them	,	``	listen	,	we	are	going	to	start	a	couple	of	hours	per	day	,	just	a	few	repairs	.	``	maybe	some	of	them	are	here	now	.
so	we	started	.
i	was	working	,	i	was	going	everyday	to	work	for	the	homeless	.
and	najmuddin	was	staying	there	,	doing	everything	and	reporting	on	the	patients	.
he	was	telling	me	,	``	patients	are	coming	.	``	we	knew	that	many	more	patients	could	not	come	,	prevented	by	the	fighting	.
but	people	were	coming	.
and	mahmoud	was	coming	every	day	.
and	slowly	,	slowly	week	after	week	his	legs	were	improving	.
the	stump	or	cast	prosthesis	was	made	,	and	he	was	starting	the	real	physical	rehabilitation	.
he	was	coming	every	day	,	crossing	the	front	line	.
a	couple	of	times	i	crossed	the	front	line	in	the	very	place	where	mahmoud	and	his	son	were	crossing	.
i	tell	you	,	it	was	something	so	sinister	that	i	was	astonished	he	could	do	it	every	day	.
but	finally	,	the	great	day	arrived	.
mahmoud	was	going	to	be	discharged	with	his	new	legs	.
it	was	april	,	i	remember	,	a	very	beautiful	day	.
april	in	kabul	is	beautiful	,	full	of	roses	,	full	of	flowers	.
we	could	not	possibly	stay	indoors	,	with	all	these	sandbags	at	the	windows	.
very	sad	,	dark	.
so	we	chose	a	small	spot	in	the	garden	.
and	mahmoud	put	on	his	prostheses	,	the	other	patients	did	the	same	,	and	they	started	practicing	for	the	last	time	before	being	discharged	.
suddenly	,	they	started	fighting	.
two	groups	of	mujahideen	started	fighting	.
we	could	hear	in	the	air	the	bullets	passing	.
so	we	dashed	,	all	of	us	,	towards	the	shelter	.
mahmoud	grabbed	his	son	,	i	grabbed	someone	else	.
everybody	was	grabbing	something	.	and	we	ran	.
you	know	,	50	meters	can	be	a	long	distance	if	you	are	totally	exposed	,	but	we	managed	to	reach	the	shelter	.
inside	,	all	of	us	panting	,	i	sat	a	moment	and	i	heard	rafi	telling	his	father	,	``	father	,	you	can	run	faster	than	me	.	``	and	mahmoud	,	``	of	course	i	can	.
i	can	run	,	and	now	you	can	go	to	school	.
no	need	of	staying	with	me	all	the	day	pushing	my	wheelchair	.	``	later	on	,	we	took	them	home	.
and	i	will	never	forget	mahmoud	and	his	son	walking	together	pushing	the	empty	wheelchair	.
and	then	i	understood	,	physical	rehabilitation	is	a	priority	.
dignity	can	not	wait	for	better	times	.
from	that	day	on	,	we	never	closed	a	single	day	.
well	sometimes	we	were	suspended	for	a	few	hours	,	but	we	never	,	we	never	closed	it	again	.
i	met	mahmoud	one	year	later	.
he	was	in	good	shape	--	a	bit	thinner	.
he	needed	to	change	his	prostheses	--	a	new	pair	of	prostheses	.
i	asked	about	his	son	.
he	told	me	,	``	he	's	at	school	.	he	'd	doing	quite	well	.	``	but	i	understood	he	wanted	to	tell	me	something	.
so	i	asked	him	,	``	what	is	that	?	``	he	was	sweating	.
he	was	clearly	embarrassed	.
and	he	was	standing	in	front	of	me	,	his	head	down	.
he	said	,	``	you	have	taught	me	to	walk	.
thank	you	very	much	.
now	help	me	not	to	be	a	beggar	anymore	.	``	that	was	the	job	.
``	my	children	are	growing	.	i	feel	ashamed	.
i	do	n't	want	them	to	be	teased	at	school	by	the	other	students	.	``	i	said	,	``	okay	.	``
i	thought	,	how	much	money	do	i	have	in	my	pocket	?
just	to	give	him	some	money	.
it	was	the	easiest	way	.
he	read	my	mind	,	and	he	said	,	``	i	ask	for	a	job	.	``	and	then	he	added	something	i	will	never	forget	for	the	rest	of	my	life	.
he	said	,	``	i	am	a	scrap	of	a	man	,	but	if	you	help	me	,	i	'm	ready	to	do	anything	,	even	if	i	have	to	crawl	on	the	ground	.	``	and	then	he	sat	down	.
i	sat	down	too	with	goosebumps	everywhere	.
legless	,	with	only	one	arm	,	illiterate	,	unskilled	--	what	job	for	him	?
najmuddin	told	me	,	``	well	we	have	a	vacancy	in	the	carpentry	shop	.	``	``	what	?	``	i	said	,	``	stop	.	``	``	well	yes	,	we	need	to	increase	the	production	of	feet	.
we	need	to	employ	someone	to	glue	and	to	screw	the	sole	of	the	feet	.
we	need	to	increase	the	production	.	``	``	excuse	me	?	``	i	could	not	believe	.
and	then	he	said	,	``	no	,	we	can	modify	the	workbench	maybe	to	put	a	special	stool	,	a	special	anvil	,	special	vice	,	and	maybe	an	electric	screwdriver	.	``	i	said	,	``	listen	,	it	's	insane	.
and	it	's	even	cruel	to	think	of	anything	like	this	.
that	's	a	production	line	and	a	very	fast	one	.
it	's	cruel	to	offer	him	a	job	knowing	that	he	's	going	to	fail	.	``	but	with	najmuddin	,	we	can	not	discuss	.
so	the	only	things	i	could	manage	to	obtain	was	a	kind	of	a	compromise	.
only	one	week	--	one	week	try	and	not	a	single	day	more	.
one	week	later	,	mahmoud	was	the	fastest	in	the	production	line	.
i	told	najmuddin	,	``	that	's	a	trick	.
i	ca	n't	believe	it	.	``	the	production	was	up	20	percent	.
``	it	's	a	trick	,	it	's	a	trick	,	``	i	said	.	and	then	i	asked	for	verification	.
it	was	true	.
the	comment	of	najmuddin	was	mahmoud	has	something	to	prove	.
i	understood	that	i	was	wrong	again	.
mahmoud	had	looked	taller	.
i	remember	him	sitting	behind	the	workbench	smiling	.
he	was	a	new	man	,	taller	again	.
of	course	,	i	understood	that	what	made	him	stand	tall	--	yeah	they	were	the	legs	,	thank	you	very	much	--	but	as	a	first	step	,	it	was	the	dignity	.
he	has	regained	his	full	dignity	thanks	to	that	job	.
so	of	course	,	i	understood	.
and	then	we	started	a	new	policy	--	a	new	policy	completely	different	.
we	decided	to	employ	as	many	disabled	as	possible	to	train	them	in	any	possible	job	.
it	became	a	policy	of	``	positive	discrimination	,	``	we	call	it	now	.
and	you	know	what	?
it	's	good	for	everybody	.
everybody	benefits	from	that	--	those	employed	,	of	course	,	because	they	get	a	job	and	dignity	.
but	also	for	the	newcomers	.
they	are	7,000	every	year	--	people	coming	for	the	first	time	.
and	you	should	see	the	faces	of	these	people	when	they	realize	that	those	assisting	them	are	like	them	.
sometimes	you	see	them	,	they	look	,	``	oh	.	``
and	you	see	the	faces	.
and	then	the	surprise	turns	into	hope	.
and	it	's	easy	for	me	as	well	to	train	someone	who	has	already	passed	through	the	experience	of	disability	.
poof	,	they	learn	much	faster	--	the	motivation	,	the	empathy	they	can	establish	with	the	patient	is	completely	different	,	completely	.
scraps	of	men	do	not	exist	.
people	like	mahmoud	are	agents	of	change	.
and	when	you	start	changing	,	you	can	not	stop	.
so	employing	people	,	yes	,	but	also	we	started	programming	projects	of	microfinance	,	education	.
and	when	you	start	,	you	can	not	stop	.
so	you	do	vocational	training	,	home	education	for	those	who	can	not	go	to	school	.
physical	therapies	can	be	done	,	not	only	in	the	orthopedic	center	,	but	also	in	the	houses	of	the	people	.
there	is	always	a	better	way	to	do	things	.
that	's	najmuddin	,	the	one	with	the	white	coat	.
terrible	najmuddin	,	is	that	one	.
i	have	learned	a	lot	from	people	like	najmuddin	,	mahmoud	,	rafi	.
they	are	my	teachers	.
i	have	a	wish	,	a	big	wish	,	that	this	way	of	working	,	this	way	of	thinking	,	is	going	to	be	implemented	in	other	countries	.
there	are	plenty	of	countries	at	war	like	afghanistan	.
it	is	possible	and	it	is	not	difficult	.
all	we	have	to	do	is	to	listen	to	the	people	that	we	are	supposed	assist	,	to	make	them	part	of	the	decision	-	making	process	and	then	,	of	course	,	to	adapt	.
this	is	my	big	wish	.
well	do	n't	think	that	the	changes	in	afghanistan	are	over	;	not	at	all	.	we	are	going	on	.
recently	we	have	just	started	a	program	,	a	sport	program	--	basketball	for	wheelchair	users	.
we	transport	the	wheelchairs	everywhere	.
we	have	several	teams	in	the	main	part	of	afghanistan	.
at	the	beginning	,	when	anajulina	told	me	,	``	we	would	like	to	start	it	,	``	i	hesitated	.
i	said	,	``	no	,	``	you	can	imagine	.
i	said	,	``	no	,	no	,	no	,	no	,	we	ca	n't	.	``	and	then	i	asked	the	usual	question	:	``	is	it	a	priority	?
is	it	really	necessary	?	``	well	now	you	should	see	me	.
i	never	miss	a	single	training	session	.
the	night	before	a	match	i	'm	very	nervous	.
and	you	should	see	me	during	the	match	.
i	shout	like	a	true	italian	.
what	's	next	?	what	is	going	to	be	the	next	change	?
well	i	do	n't	know	yet	,	but	i	'm	sure	najmuddin	and	his	friends	,	they	have	it	already	in	mind	.
that	was	my	story	.	thank	you	very	much	.
