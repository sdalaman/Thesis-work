three	years	ago	,	i	got	a	phone	call	,	based	on	an	earlier	film	i	had	made	,	with	an	offer	to	embed	the	new	hampshire	national	guard	.
my	idea	--	and	literally	,	i	woke	up	in	the	middle	of	the	night	,	and	we	've	all	have	those	moments	.	you	know	,	you	go	to	sleep	--
i	was	excited	,	with	this	phone	call	.
i	was	thinking	,	i	just	finished	making	another	film	about	world	war	ii	vets	,	and	i	realized	i	'd	gotten	to	know	their	stories	,	and	i	realized	this	was	a	once	-	in	-	a	-	lifetime	opportunity	to	tell	a	warrior	's	story	as	it	unfolded	.
so	i	went	to	bed	that	night	pretty	excited	.
not	sure	of	all	the	details	,	but	excited	.
it	was	n't	at	four	in	the	morning	,	but	it	was	closer	to	midnight	.
woke	straight	up	.	wide	-	awake	as	could	be	.
and	i	had	this	idea	:	what	if	i	could	,	in	effect	,	virtually	embed	,
and	create	a	permeable	relationship	with	the	soldiers	?
to	tell	the	story	from	the	inside	out	,	versus	the	outside	in	?
so	,	i	called	back	major	heilshorn	,	who	's	the	public	affairs	officer	of	the	new	hampshire	national	guard	.
and	he	knew	me	,	so	i	was	like	,	``	greg	?	``
he	's	like	,	``	yes	,	deborah	?	``
told	him	my	idea	,	and	you	know	,	he	is	one	of	the	bravest	men	in	the	world	,	as	is	general	blair	,	who	,	in	the	end	,	gave	me	permission	to	try	this	experiment	.
within	10	days	,	i	was	down	at	fort	dix	.
he	gave	me	my	pick	of	units	.
i	picked	one	unit	--	charlie	company	,	third	of	the	172nd	,	they	're	mountain	infantry	--	for	two	reasons	.
one	,	they	're	infantry	.
number	two	,	they	were	going	to	be	based	at	lsa	anaconda	,	so	i	knew	they	would	have	internet	access	.
the	caveat	for	my	access	was	i	had	to	get	the	soldiers	to	volunteer	.
this	was	a	big	thing	that
i	think	when	major	h	told	me	,	i	was	n't	really	totally	gathering	what	that	would	mean	.
so	what	that	meant	was	,	when	i	went	down	to	fort	dix	,	i	had	to	hop	out	in	front	of	180	guys	and	tell	them	of	my	vision	.
you	can	imagine	the	hailstorm	of	questions	i	got	.
the	opening	one	was	,	``	what	the	fuck	do	you	know	about	the	national	guard	?	``
i	started	with	the	1607	massachusetts	bay	colony	pequot	indian	wars	.
gave	them	about	a	nine	minute	response	,	and	there	we	went	.
so	,	i	'd	like	to	show	the	clip	of	the	film	.
it	's	our	trailer	,	because	i	know	,	obviously	you	guys	are	busy	,	many	of	you	may	not	have	had	a	chance	to	see	it	.
so	,	i	want	to	show	the	trailer	,	and	then	i	'm	going	to	take	apart	one	scene	in	detail	.
if	we	could	roll	?
stephen	pink	:	this	is	sergeant	stephen	pink	.
michael	moriarty	:	specialist	michael	moriarty	.
zack	bazzi	:	do	i	really	want	to	go	?	probably	not	.
soldier	:	we	're	not	supposed	to	talk	to	the	media	.
sp	:	i	'm	not	the	media	,	dammit	!
mm	:	the	day	is	here	.	life	will	change	.
voice	:	the	real	deal	,	man	!	narrator	:	you	ready	?
soldier	:	bring	it	on	!	narrator	:	you	ready	?	voice	2	:	iraq	,	here	we	come	!
zb	:	every	soldier	eventually	wants	to	go	in	combat	.
it	's	natural	instinct	.
sp	:	if	you	let	fear	get	to	you	,	then	you	're	not	going	to	be	doing	your	job	.
mm	:	every	single	time	you	go	out	there	,	there	's	attacks	.
it	's	unbelievable	.
zb	:	hey	,	nestor	,	your	ass	crack	is	right	in	my	face	.
soldiers	:	iv	!	are	we	on	fire	?	iv	!
man	down	!	man	down	!
mm	:	keep	going	,	brother	.	you	wan	na	play	?
michael	moriarty	's	wife	:	it	's	really	hard	for	him	to	not	have	his	dad	.
mm	:	this	little	kid	is	in	the	middle	of	a	war	zone	.
stephen	pink	's	girlfriend	:	in	the	beginning	,	he	's	like	,	``	write	something	dirty	!	``
george	w.	bush	:	the	world	's	newest	democracy	.
mm	:	they	're	shooting	at	me	.
sp	:	you	do	n't	put	150,000	troops	in	there	,	and	say	we	're	there	to	create	democracy	.
soldier	:	we	've	got	a	drive	through	window	at	burger	king	now	.
sp	:	we	're	here	to	create	money	.
mm	:	i	support	george	bush	.	we	're	not	there	for	the	oil	.
jon	baril	:	the	worst	thing	in	my	life	.
sp	:	baril	,	do	n't	look	at	it	,	bud	.
michael	moriarty	's	wife	:	he	's	not	the	same	person	anymore	.
mm	:	i	will	not	go	back	.
kevin	shangraw	:	the	iraqi	people	are	who	we	are	there	to	help	--	and	we	just	killed	one	.
soldiers	:	sergeant	smith	is	down	!	sergeant	smith	is	down	?
there	they	are	!	right	there	!	fire	,	fire	!
jb	:	it	'll	be	a	better	country	in	20	years	,	'	cause	we	were	there	.	i	hope	.
deborah	scranton	:	thank	you	.
one	of	the	things	i	'd	like	to	talk	to	you	about	is	having	a	conversation	about	something	that	is	difficult	to	talk	about	.
and	i	'd	like	to	relate	an	experience	i	had	here	at	ted	.
i	do	n't	know	how	many	of	you	might	imagine	it	,	but	there	's	actually	a	tedster	who	recently	got	back	from	iraq	.
paul	?	come	on	,	stand	up	.
this	is	paul	anthony	.
he	served	--	--	with	the	marines	,	and	i	want	to	tell	you	a	little	,	brief	story	.
we	were	one	of	the	lucky	ones	to	get	in	the	class	with	the	sony	cameras	and	the	vista	software	.
right	?	and	we	started	talking	.
people	will	see	my	tag	,	and	they	'll	see	``	the	war	tapes	,	``	and	then	we	'll	start	talking	about	war	.
we	got	in	a	conversation	with	some	other	people	in	the	class	,	and	it	went	on	and	on	.
i	mean	,	we	were	there	for	an	hour	,	talking	.
and	it	really	highlighted	something	that	i	would	like	to	ask	you	guys	to	think	about	and	hopefully	to	help	with	,
which	is	,	i	think	a	lot	of	us	are	very	afraid	to	have	conversations	about	war	,	and	about	politics	.
and	really	--	because	maybe	we	're	going	to	disagree	.
maybe	it	's	going	to	get	uncomfortable	.
how	do	we	open	it	up	to	really	be	able	to	have	a	conversation	?
and	you	know	,	paul	was	talking	,	and	he	then	turned	to	constance	and	said	,	``	you	know	,	i	would	n't	have	this	conversation	if	she	were	n't	here	,	because	i	know	she	has	my	back	.	``
and	i	want	to	say	,	i	was	nervous	.
because	i	'm	used	to	doing	q	&	as	.
i	really	related	to	what	james	was	saying	yesterday	,	because	i	'm	behind	the	camera	.
you	know	,	i	can	answer	questions	about	my	movie	,	but	for	me	to	come	up	and	talk	for	18	minutes	is	a	really	long	time	.
so	,	i	wanted	to	say	,	paul	,	i	'm	happy	you	're	here	,	because	i	know	you	have	my	back	.
this	film	was	not	about	the	internet	,	but	it	could	not	have	been	made	without	it	.
the	guys	'	tapes	on	average	took	two	weeks	to	get	from	iraq	to	me	.
in	the	meantime	,	the	soldiers	--	we	would	email	and	im	.
i	did	n't	save	all	of	them	,	because	i	did	n't	realize	at	the	beginning	that	it	would	be	something	that	i	would	want	to	keep	track	of	.
but	there	were	3,211	emails	and	ims	and	text	messages	that	i	was	able	to	save	.
the	reason	i	quantify	that	is	because	we	really	embarked	on	this	as	a	mutual	journey	to	really	get	inside	of	it	.
so	i	wanted	to	show	you	a	clip	,	and	then	i	was	going	tell	you	a	little	bit	of	how	it	got	put	together	.
if	we	could	roll	the	clip	.
sp	:	today	is	sport	.	[	unclear	]	radio	:	[	unclear	]	christian	soldiers	.
sp	:	we	like	to	give	these	insurgents	a	fair	chance	.
so	,	what	we	do	,	we	ride	with	the	windows	down	.
because	,	you	know	,	we	obviously	have	the	advantage	.	i	'm	just	kidding	.
we	do	n't	fucking	ride	with	the	goddam	windows	down	.
it	's	not	true	.	very	unsafe	.
whoa	.
soldier	:	right	there	.
sp	:	all	right	,	let	's	get	over	to	that	site	.
be	advised	,	we	're	leaving	taji	right	now	.
we	believe	that	the	blast	was	right	outside	the	gate	of	taji	,	we	're	heading	to	that	location	now	.
soldier	:	that	's	a	fucking	car	bomb	!
soldier	:	motherfuckers	!
soldiers	:	get	your	vest	on	!
hey	,	get	over	the	fucking	--	yeah	,	yeah	.
any	one	-	four	elements	get	to	the	gate	!
sp	:	sheriff	one	-	six	,	or	any	one	-	four	elements	,	we	need	you	at	the	gate	of	taji	right	now	,	over	.
soldier	:	i	'll	walk	you	through	it	.
sp	:	stay	low	.	head	over	to	the	right	.
get	your	bag	,	get	your	bag	!
sp	:	it	was	mass	casualties	.
probably	20	dead	,	at	least	20	or	30	wounded	iraqis	.
sp	:	it	just	looked	like	,	you	know	,	someone	had	thrown	a	quarter	through	a	guy	,	and	it	was	just	like	--	there	was	no	blood	coming	from	the	shrapnel	wounds	.
everything	was	cauterized	,	and	it	was	just	like	there	was	a	void	going	through	the	body	.
this	is	the	scene	north	.
they	just	removed	a	burnt	body	,	or	half	a	body	from	here	.
i	do	n't	think	there	was	anything	left	from	his	abdominal	down	.
this	is	blood	.
and	you	know	,	you	walk	,	and	you	hear	the	pieces	of	skin	.	and	that	's	it	,	that	's	all	that	's	left	.	i	remember	giving	three	ivs	,	bandaging	several	wounded	.
soldiers	sitting	in	the	corner	of	a	sandbag	wall	,	shaking	and	screaming	.
medics	who	were	terrified	and	could	n't	perform	.
i	later	heard	that	iraqi	casualties	were	not	to	be	treated	in	taji	.
they	can	work	on	the	post	for	pennies	,	but	ca	n't	die	there	.
they	've	got	to	die	outside	.
if	one	of	those	incompetent	medical	officers	told	me	to	stop	treatment	,	i	would	've	slit	his	throat	right	there	.
21:00	hours	,	and	it	's	just	our	squad	going	through	today	's	events	in	our	heads	,	whether	we	want	to	or	not	.
news	anchor	:	more	violence	in	iraq	.
twin	suicide	car	bombings	killed	eight	iraqis	and	wounded	dozens	more	near	a	coalition	base	north	of	baghdad	.
sp	:	we	made	the	news	.
i	feel	exploited	and	proud	at	the	same	time	.
i	've	lost	all	faith	in	the	media	--	a	hapless	joke	i	would	much	rather	laugh	at	than	become	a	part	of	.
i	should	really	thank	god	for	saving	my	lucky	ass	.
i	'll	do	that	,	then	i	'm	gon	na	jerk	off	.
because	these	pages	smell	like	linds	,	and	there	wo	n't	be	any	time	for	jerking	off	tomorrow	.
another	mission	at	06:00	.
ds	:	now	--	--	thanks	.
when	i	said	earlier	,	to	try	and	tell	a	story	from	the	inside	out	,	versus	the	outside	in	--	part	of	what	chris	said	so	eloquently	in	his	introduction	--	is	this	melding	.
it	's	a	new	way	of	trying	to	make	a	documentary	.
when	i	met	the	guys	,	and	10	of	them	agreed	to	take	cameras	--
in	total	,	21	ended	up	filming	.
five	soldiers	filmed	the	entire	time	.
there	are	three	featured	in	the	film	.
the	way	i	learned	about	taji	was	steve	pink	sent	me	an	email	,	and	in	it	,	attached	a	photo	of	that	burned	body	out	at	the	car	.
and	the	tone	from	the	email	was	,	you	know	,	it	had	been	a	very	bad	day	,	obviously	.
and	i	saw	in	my	im	window	that	mike	moriarty	was	at	the	base	.
so	,	i	pinged	mike	and	i	said	,	``	mike	,	can	you	please	go	get	that	interview	with	pink	?	``
because	the	thing	that	very	often	is	missing	is	,	in	the	military	what	they	call	``	hot	wash	.	``
it	's	that	immediate	interview	after	something	immediately	happens	,	you	know	.
and	if	you	let	time	go	by	,	it	kind	of	softens	and	smooths	the	edges	.
and	for	me	,	i	really	wanted	that	.
so	,	in	order	to	get	the	intimacy	,	to	share	that	experience	with	you	,	the	guys	--	the	two	most	popular	mounts	--	there	was	a	camera	on	the	turret	,	the	gun	turret	,	and	then	on	the	dashboard	of	the	humvee	.
most	of	the	humvees	,	we	ended	up	mounting	two	cameras	in	them	.
so	you	get	to	experience	that	in	real	time	,	right	?
the	interview	that	you	see	is	the	one	that	mike	went	and	did	within	24	hours	of	that	episode	happening	.
steve	pink	reading	his	journal	happened	five	months	after	he	came	home	.
i	knew	about	that	journal	,	but	it	was	very	,	very	private	.
and	you	know	,	you	earn	someone	's	trust	,	especially	in	doc	filmmaking	,	through	your	relationship	.
so	,	it	was	n't	until	five	months	after	he	was	home	that	he	would	read	that	journal	.
now	,	the	news	footage	i	put	in	there	to	try	to	show	--	you	know	,	i	think	mainstream	media	tries	to	do	the	best	they	can	in	the	format	that	they	have	.
but	the	thing	that	i	know	you	all	have	heard	a	lot	of	times	,	american	soldiers	saying	,	``	why	do	n't	they	talk	about	the	good	stuff	that	we	do	?	``
ok	,	this	is	a	perfect	example	.
pink	's	squad	and	another	squad	spent	their	entire	day	outside	the	wire	.
they	did	n't	have	to	go	outside	the	wire	.
there	were	not	americans	hurt	out	there	.
they	spent	their	entire	day	outside	the	wire	trying	to	save	iraqi	lives	--	the	iraqis	who	work	on	the	post	.
so	,	when	you	may	hear	soldiers	complaining	,	that	's	what	they	're	talking	about	,	you	know	?
and	i	think	it	's	such	an	amazing	gift	that	they	would	share	this	as	a	way	of	bridging	.
and	when	i	talk	about	that	polarity	i	get	at	so	many	different	q	&	as	,	and	people	are	really	opinionated	.
but	it	seems	like	people	do	n't	want	to	hear	so	much	,
or	listen	,	or	try	to	have	an	exchange	.
and	i	'm	as	fiery	as	the	next	person	,	but	i	really	think	--	you	know	,	different	speakers	have	talked	about	their	concern	for	the	world	,	and	my	concern	is	that	we	have	to	have	these	conversations	.
and	we	have	to	be	able	to	go	into	scary	places	where	we	may	,	you	know	,	we	think	we	know	.
but	we	just	have	to	leave	that	little	bit	of	openness	,	to	know	.
there	's	such	a	disconnect	.
and	for	me	,	it	's	trying	to	bridge	that	disconnect	.
i	'll	share	one	story	.
i	get	--	i	'm	often	asked	,	you	know	,	for	me	,	what	have	been	some	of	the	special	moments	from	having	worked	on	this	film	.
and	at	screenings	,	inevitably	--	you	know	,	as	i	'm	sure	all	of	you	obviously	do	speaking	stuff	--	usually	you	have	people	who	hang	around	and	want	to	ask	you	more	questions	.
and	usually	,	the	first	questions	are	,	``	oh	,	what	kind	of	cameras	did	you	use	?	``
or	you	know	,	these	things	.
but	there	's	always	a	few	guys	,	almost	always	,	who	are	the	last	ones	.
and	i	've	learned	over	time	that	those	are	always	the	soldiers	.
and	they	wait	until	pretty	much	everybody	's	gone	.
and	for	me	,	one	of	the	most	profound	stories	someone	shared	with	me	,	that	then	became	my	story	,	was	--	for	those	of	you	who	have	n't	seen	the	film	,	and	it	's	not	a	spoiler	--	it	's	very	common	there	are	a	lot	of	civilian	accidents	,	where	people	get	in	front	of	humvees	and	they	get	killed	.
in	this	film	,	there	is	a	scene	where	an	iraqi	woman	is	killed	.
a	soldier	came	up	to	me	and	stood	,	you	know	really	,	pretty	close	,	a	foot	away	from	me	.
he	's	a	big	guy	.
and	he	looked	at	me	,	and	i	smiled	,	and	then	i	saw	the	tears	start	welling	up	in	his	eyes	.
and	he	was	n't	going	to	blink	.
and	he	said	,	``	my	gunner	was	throwing	candy	.	``
and	i	knew	what	he	was	going	to	say	.
the	gunner	was	throwing	candy	.
they	used	to	throw	candy	to	the	kids	.
kids	got	too	close	,	very	often	.
and	he	said	,	``	i	killed	a	child	.
and	i	'm	a	father	.	i	have	children	.
i	have	n't	been	able	to	tell	my	wife	.
i	'm	afraid	she	's	going	to	think	i	'm	a	monster	.	``
i	hugged	him	,	of	course	,	and	i	said	,	you	know	,	``	it	's	going	to	be	ok	.	``
and	he	said	,	``	i	'm	going	to	bring	her	to	see	your	film	.
and	then	i	'm	going	to	tell	her	.	``
so	when	i	talk	about	a	disconnect	,	it	's	not	only	for	maybe	those	people	who	do	n't	know	a	soldier	,
which	there	obviously	are	.	you	know	,	these	days	,
it	's	not	like	world	war	ii	,	where	there	was	a	war	front	and	a	home	front	,	and	everybody	seemed	involved	.
you	can	go	for	days	here	and	not	feel	like	there	's	a	war	going	on	.
and	often	,	i	'll	hear	people	say	,	who	maybe	know	that	i	did	this	film	,	and	they	say	,	``	oh	,	you	know	,	i	'm	against	the	war	,	but	i	support	the	soldiers	.	``
and	i	've	started	to	ask	them	,	``	well	,	that	's	nice	.	what	are	you	doing	?
are	you	volunteering	at	a	va	?
you	go	and	see	anybody	?
do	you	,	if	you	find	out	your	neighbor	's	been	,	do	you	spend	some	time	?
not	necessarily	ask	questions	,	but	see	if	they	want	to	talk	?
do	you	give	money	to	any	of	the	charities	?	``
you	know	,	obviously	,	like	dean	kamen	's	working	on	that	amazing	thing	,	but	there	's	charities	where	you	can	sponsor	computers	for	wounded	soldiers	.
i	think	,	i	challenge	us	to	say	--	to	operationalize	those	terms	,	when	we	say	we	support	someone	,	you	know	?
are	you	a	friend	to	them	?
do	you	really	care	?
and	i	would	just	say	it	's	my	hope	,	and	i	would	ask	you	guys	to	please	,	you	know	,	reach	out	a	hand	.
and	really	do	give	them	a	hug	.
thank	you	.
