i	got	a	visit	almost	exactly	a	year	ago	,	a	little	over	a	year	ago	,	from	a	very	senior	person	at	the	department	of	defense	.
came	to	see	me	and	said	,	``	1,600	of	the	kids	that	we	've	sent	out	have	come	back	missing	at	least	one	full	arm	.
whole	arm	.	shoulder	disarticulation	.
and	we	're	doing	the	same	thing	we	did	for	--	more	or	less	,	that	we	've	done	since	the	civil	war	,	a	stick	and	a	hook	.
and	they	deserve	more	than	that	.	``
and	literally	,	this	guy	sat	in	my	office	in	new	hampshire	and	said	,	``	i	want	you	to	give	me	something	that	we	can	put	on	these	kids	that	'll	pick	up	a	raisin	or	a	grape	off	a	table	,	they	'll	be	able	to	put	it	in	their	mouth	without	destroying	either	one	,	and	they	'll	be	able	to	know	the	difference	without	looking	at	it	.	``
you	know	,	had	efferent	,	afferent	,	and	haptic	response	.
he	finishes	explaining	that	,	and	i	'm	waiting	for	the	big	300	pound	paper	proposal	,
and	he	said	,	``	that	's	what	i	want	from	you	.	``
i	said	,	``	look	,	you	're	nuts	.	that	technology	's	just	not	available	right	now	.
and	it	ca	n't	be	done	.
not	in	an	envelope	of	a	human	arm	,	with	21	degrees	of	freedom	,	from	your	shoulder	to	your	fingertips	.	``
he	said	,	``	about	two	dozen	of	these	1,600	kids	have	come	back	bilateral	.
you	think	it	's	bad	to	lose	one	arm	?
that	's	an	inconvenience	compared	to	having	both	of	them	gone	.	``
i	got	a	day	job	,	and	my	nights	and	weekends	are	already	filled	up	with	things	like	,	let	's	supply	water	to	the	world	,	and	power	to	the	world	,	and	educate	all	the	kids	,	which	,	chris	,	i	will	not	talk	about	.	i	do	n't	need	another	mission	.
i	keep	thinking	about	these	kids	with	no	arms	.
he	says	to	me	,	``	we	've	done	some	work	around	the	country	.
we	've	got	some	pretty	amazing	neurology	and	other	people	.	``
i	said	,	``	i	'll	take	a	field	trip	,	i	'll	go	see	what	you	got	.	``
over	the	next	month	i	visited	lots	of	places	,	some	out	here	,	around	the	country	,	found	the	best	of	the	best	.
i	went	down	to	washington	.	i	saw	these	guys	,	and	said	,	``	i	did	what	you	asked	me	.	i	looked	at	what	's	out	there	.
i	still	think	you	're	nuts	.	but	not	as	nuts	as	i	thought	.	``
i	put	a	team	together	,	a	little	over	13	months	ago	,	got	up	to	20	some	-	odd	people	.
we	said	,	we	're	going	to	build	a	device	that	does	what	he	wants	.
we	have	14	out	of	the	21	degrees	of	freedom	;	you	do	n't	need	the	ones	in	the	last	two	fingers	.
we	put	this	thing	together	.
a	couple	of	weeks	ago	we	took	it	down	to	walter	reed	,	which	is	unfortunately	more	in	the	news	these	days	.
we	showed	it	to	a	bunch	of	guys	.
one	guy	who	described	himself	as	being	lucky	,	because	he	lost	his	left	arm	,	and	he	's	a	righty	.
he	sat	at	a	table	with	seven	or	eight	of	these	other	guys	.
said	he	was	lucky	,	because	he	had	his	good	arm	,	and	then	he	pushed	himself	back	from	the	table	.	he	had	no	legs	.
these	kids	have	attitudes	that	you	just	ca	n't	believe	.
so	i	'm	going	to	show	you	now	,	without	the	skin	on	it	,	a	30	-	second	piece	,	and	then	i	'm	done	.
but	understand	what	you	're	looking	at	we	made	small	enough	to	fit	on	a	50th	percentile	female	,	so	that	we	could	put	it	in	any	of	these	people	.
it	's	going	to	go	inside	something	that	we	use	in	cat	scans	and	mris	of	whatever	is	their	good	arm	,	to	make	silicon	rubber	,	then	coat	it	,	and	paint	it	in	3d	--	exact	mirror	image	of	their	other	limb	.
so	,	you	wo	n't	see	all	the	really	cool	stuff	that	's	in	this	series	elastic	set	of	14	actuators	,	each	one	which	has	its	own	capability	to	sense	temperature	and	pressure	.
it	also	has	a	pneumatic	cuff	that	holds	it	on	,	so	the	more	they	put	themselves	under	load	,	the	more	it	attaches	.
they	take	the	load	off	,	and	it	becomes	,	again	,	compliant	.
i	'm	going	to	show	you	a	guy	doing	a	couple	of	simple	things	with	this	that	we	demonstrated	in	washington	.	can	we	look	at	this	thing	?
watch	the	fingers	grab	.	the	thumb	comes	up	.	wrist	.
this	weighs	6.9	pounds	.
going	to	scratch	his	nose	.
it	's	got	14	active	degrees	of	freedom	.
now	he	's	going	to	pick	up	a	pen	with	his	opposed	thumb	and	index	finger	.
now	he	's	going	to	put	that	down	,	pick	up	a	piece	of	paper	,	rotate	all	the	degrees	of	freedom	in	his	hand	and	wrist	,	and	read	it	.
