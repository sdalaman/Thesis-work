about	a	year	ago	,	i	asked	myself	a	question	:	``	knowing	what	i	know	,	why	am	i	not	a	vegetarian	?	``
after	all	,	i	'm	one	of	the	green	guys	:
i	grew	up	with	hippie	parents	in	a	log	cabin	.
i	started	a	site	called	treehugger	--
i	care	about	this	stuff	.
i	knew	that	eating	a	mere	hamburger	a	day	can	increase	my	risk	of	dying	by	a	third	.
cruelty	:	i	knew	that	the	10	billion	animals	we	raise	each	year	for	meat	are	raised	in	factory	farm	conditions	that	we	,	hypocritically	,	would	n't	even	consider	for	our	own	cats	,	dogs	and	other	pets	.
environmentally	,	meat	,	amazingly	,	causes	more	emissions	than	all	of	transportation	combined	:	cars	,	trains	,	planes	,	buses	,	boats	,	all	of	it	.
and	beef	production	uses	100	times	the	water	that	most	vegetables	do	.
i	also	knew	that	i	'm	not	alone	.
we	as	a	society	are	eating	twice	as	much	meat	as	we	did	in	the	50s	.
so	what	was	once	the	special	little	side	treat	now	is	the	main	,	much	more	regular	.
so	really	,	any	of	these	angles	should	have	been	enough	to	convince	me	to	go	vegetarian	.
yet	,	there	i	was	--	chk	,	chk	,	chk	--	tucking	into	a	big	old	steak	.
so	why	was	i	stalling	?
i	realized	that	what	i	was	being	pitched	was	a	binary	solution	.
it	was	either	you	're	a	meat	eater	or	you	're	a	vegetarian	,
and	i	guess	i	just	was	n't	quite	ready	.
imagine	your	last	hamburger	.
so	my	common	sense	,	my	good	intentions	,	were	in	conflict	with	my	taste	buds	.
and	i	'd	commit	to	doing	it	later	,
and	not	surprisingly	,	later	never	came	.
sound	familiar	?
so	i	wondered	,	might	there	be	a	third	solution	?
and	i	thought	about	it	,	and	i	came	up	with	one	.
i	've	been	doing	it	for	the	last	year	,	and	it	's	great	.
it	's	called	weekday	veg	.
the	name	says	it	all	:
nothing	with	a	face	monday	through	friday	.
on	the	weekend	,	your	choice	.
simple	.
if	you	want	to	take	it	to	the	next	level	,	remember	,	the	major	culprits	in	terms	of	environmental	damage	and	health	are	red	and	processed	meats	.
so	you	want	to	swap	those	out	with	some	good	,	sustainably	harvested	fish	.
it	's	structured	,	so	it	ends	up	being	simple	to	remember	,
and	it	's	okay	to	break	it	here	and	there	.
after	all	,	cutting	five	days	a	week	is	cutting	70	percent	of	your	meat	intake	.
the	program	has	been	great	,	weekday	veg	.
my	footprint	's	smaller	,	i	'm	lessening	pollution	,
i	feel	better	about	the	animals	,
i	'm	even	saving	money	.
best	of	all	,	i	'm	healthier	,	i	know	that	i	'm	going	to	live	longer	,	and	i	've	even	lost	a	little	weight	.
so	,	please	ask	yourselves	,	for	your	health	,	for	your	pocketbook	,	for	the	environment	,	for	the	animals	:	what	's	stopping	you	from	giving	weekday	veg	a	shot	?
after	all	,	if	all	of	us	ate	half	as	much	meat	,	it	would	be	like	half	of	us	were	vegetarians	.
thank	you	.
