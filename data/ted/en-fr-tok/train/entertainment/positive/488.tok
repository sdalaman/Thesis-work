about	four	years	ago	,	the	new	yorker	published	an	article	about	a	cache	of	dodo	bones	that	was	found	in	a	pit	on	the	island	of	mauritius	.
now	,	the	island	of	mauritius	is	a	small	island	off	the	east	coast	of	madagascar	in	the	indian	ocean	,	and	it	is	the	place	where	the	dodo	bird	was	discovered	and	extinguished	,	all	within	about	150	years	.
everyone	was	very	excited	about	this	archaeological	find	,	because	it	meant	that	they	might	finally	be	able	to	assemble	a	single	dodo	skeleton	.
see	,	while	museums	all	over	the	world	have	dodo	skeletons	in	their	collection	,	nobody	--	not	even	the	actual	natural	history	museum	on	the	island	of	mauritius	--	has	a	skeleton	that	's	made	from	the	bones	of	a	single	dodo	.
well	,	this	is	n't	exactly	true	.
the	fact	is	,	is	that	the	british	museum	had	a	complete	specimen	of	a	dodo	in	their	collection	up	until	the	18th	century	--	it	was	actually	mummified	,	skin	and	all	--	but	in	a	fit	of	space	-	saving	zeal	,	they	actually	cut	off	the	head	and	they	cut	off	the	feet	and	they	burned	the	rest	in	a	bonfire	.
if	you	go	look	at	their	website	today	,	they	'll	actually	list	these	specimens	,	saying	,	the	rest	was	lost	in	a	fire	.
not	quite	the	whole	truth	.	anyway	.
the	frontispiece	of	this	article	was	this	photo	,	and	i	'm	one	of	the	people	that	thinks	that	tina	brown	was	great	for	bringing	photos	to	the	new	yorker	,	because	this	photo	completely	rocked	my	world	.
i	became	obsessed	with	the	object	--	not	just	the	beautiful	photograph	itself	,	the	wire	you	can	see	on	the	beak	there	that	the	conservator	used	to	put	this	skeleton	together	--	there	's	an	entire	story	here	.
and	i	thought	to	myself	,	would	n't	it	be	great	if	i	had	my	own	dodo	skeleton	?
i	want	to	point	out	here	at	this	point	that	i	've	spent	my	life	obsessed	by	objects	and	the	stories	that	they	tell	,	and	this	was	the	very	latest	one	.
so	i	began	looking	around	for	--	to	see	if	anyone	sold	a	kit	,	some	kind	of	model	that	i	could	get	,	and	i	found	lots	of	reference	material	,	lots	of	lovely	pictures	.	no	dice	:	no	dodo	skeleton	for	me	.	but	the	damage	had	been	done	.
i	had	saved	a	few	hundred	photos	of	dodo	skeletons	into	my	``	creative	projects	``	folder	--	it	's	a	repository	for	my	brain	,	everything	that	i	could	possibly	be	interested	in	.
any	time	i	have	an	internet	connection	,	there	's	a	sluice	of	stuff	moving	into	there	,	everything	from	beautiful	rings	to	cockpit	photos	.
the	key	that	the	marquis	du	lafayette	sent	to	george	washington	to	celebrate	the	storming	of	the	bastille	.
russian	nuclear	launch	key	:
the	one	on	the	top	is	the	picture	of	the	one	i	found	on	ebay	;	the	one	on	the	bottom	is	the	one	i	made	for	myself	,	because	i	could	n't	afford	the	one	on	ebay	.
storm	trooper	costumes	.	maps	of	middle	earth	--	that	's	one	i	hand	-	drew	myself	.	there	's	the	dodo	skeleton	folder	.
this	folder	has	17,000	photos	--	over	20	gigabytes	of	information	--	and	it	's	growing	constantly	.
and	one	day	,	a	couple	of	weeks	later	,	it	might	have	been	maybe	a	year	later	,	i	was	in	the	art	store	with	my	kids	,	and	i	was	buying	some	clay	tools	--	we	were	going	to	have	a	craft	day	.
i	bought	some	super	sculpeys	,	some	armature	wire	,	some	various	materials	.
and	i	looked	down	at	this	sculpey	,	and	i	thought	,	maybe	,
yeah	,	maybe	i	could	make	my	own	dodo	skull	.
i	should	point	out	at	this	time	--	i	'm	not	a	sculptor	;
i	'm	a	hard	-	edged	model	maker	.
you	give	me	a	drawing	,	you	give	me	a	prop	to	replicate	,	you	give	me	a	crane	,	scaffolding	,	parts	from	``	star	wars	``	--	especially	parts	from	``	star	wars	``	--	i	can	do	this	stuff	all	day	long	.
it	's	exactly	how	i	made	my	living	for	15	years	.
but	you	give	me	something	like	this	--	my	friend	mike	murnane	sculpted	this	;	it	's	a	maquette	for	``	star	wars	,	episode	two	``	--	this	is	not	my	thing	--	this	is	something	other	people	do	--	dragons	,	soft	things	.
however	,	i	felt	like	i	had	looked	at	enough	photos	of	dodo	skulls	to	actually	be	able	to	understand	the	topology	and	perhaps	replicate	it	--	i	mean	,	it	could	n't	be	that	difficult	.
so	,	i	started	looking	at	the	best	photos	i	could	find	.
i	grabbed	all	the	reference	,	and	i	found	this	lovely	piece	of	reference	.
this	is	someone	selling	this	on	ebay	;	it	was	clearly	a	woman	's	hand	,	hopefully	a	woman	's	hand	.
assuming	it	was	roughly	the	size	of	my	wife	's	hand	,	i	made	some	measurements	of	her	thumb	,	and	i	scaled	them	out	to	the	size	of	the	skull	.
i	blew	it	up	to	the	actual	size	,	and	i	began	using	that	,	along	with	all	the	other	reference	that	i	had	,	comparing	it	to	it	as	size	reference	for	figuring	out	exactly	how	big	the	beak	should	be	,	exactly	how	long	,	etc	.
and	over	a	few	hours	,	i	eventually	achieved	what	was	actually	a	pretty	reasonable	dodo	skull	.	and	i	did	n't	mean	to	continue	,	i	--	it	's	kind	of	like	,	you	know	,	you	can	only	clean	a	super	messy	room	by	picking	up	one	thing	at	a	time	;	you	ca	n't	think	about	the	totality	.
i	was	n't	thinking	about	a	dodo	skeleton	;	i	just	noticed	that	as	i	finished	this	skull	,	the	armature	wire	that	i	had	been	used	to	holding	it	up	was	sticking	out	of	the	back	just	where	a	spine	would	be	.
and	one	of	the	other	things	i	'd	been	interested	in	and	obsessed	with	over	the	years	is	spines	and	skeletons	,	having	collected	a	couple	of	hundred	.
i	actually	understood	the	mechanics	of	vertebrae	enough	to	kind	of	start	to	imitate	them	.
and	so	button	by	button	,	vertebrae	by	vertebrae	,	i	built	my	way	down	.
and	actually	,	by	the	end	of	the	day	,	i	had	a	reasonable	skull	,	a	moderately	good	vertebrae	and	half	of	a	pelvis	.
and	again	,	i	kept	on	going	,	looking	for	more	reference	,	every	bit	of	reference	i	could	find	--	drawings	,	beautiful	photos	.
this	guy	--	i	love	this	guy	!	he	put	a	dodo	leg	bones	on	a	scanner	with	a	ruler	.
this	is	the	kind	of	accuracy	that	i	wanted	,	and	i	replicated	every	last	bone	and	put	it	in	.
and	after	about	six	weeks	,	i	finished	,	painted	,	mounted	my	own	dodo	skeleton	.
you	can	see	that	i	even	made	a	museum	label	for	it	that	includes	a	brief	history	of	the	dodo	.
and	tap	plastics	made	me	--	although	i	did	n't	photograph	it	--	a	museum	vitrine	.
i	do	n't	have	the	room	for	this	in	my	house	,	but	i	had	to	finish	what	i	had	started	.
and	this	actually	represented	kind	of	a	sea	change	to	me	.
again	,	like	i	said	,	my	life	has	been	about	being	fascinated	by	objects	and	the	stories	that	they	tell	,	and	also	making	them	for	myself	,	obtaining	them	,	appreciating	them	and	diving	into	them	.
and	in	this	folder	,	``	creative	projects	,	``	there	are	tons	of	projects	that	i	'm	currently	working	on	,	projects	that	i	've	already	worked	on	,	things	that	i	might	want	to	work	on	some	day	,	and	things	that	i	may	just	want	to	find	and	buy	and	have	and	look	at	and	touch	.
but	now	there	was	potentially	this	new	category	of	things	that	i	could	sculpt	that	was	different	,	that	i	--	you	know	,	i	have	my	own	r	2d2	,	but	that	's	--	honestly	,	relative	to	sculpting	,	to	me	,	that	's	easy	.
and	so	i	went	back	and	looked	through	my	``	creative	projects	``	folder	,	and	i	happened	across	the	maltese	falcon	.
now	,	this	is	funny	for	me	:	to	fall	in	love	with	an	object	from	a	hammett	novel	,	because	if	it	's	true	that	the	world	is	divided	into	two	types	of	people	,	chandler	people	and	hammett	people	,	i	am	absolutely	a	chandler	person	.
but	in	this	case	,	it	's	not	about	the	author	,	it	's	not	about	the	book	or	the	movie	or	the	story	,	it	's	about	the	object	in	and	of	itself	.
and	in	this	case	,	this	object	is	--	plays	on	a	host	of	levels	.
first	of	all	,	there	's	the	object	in	the	world	.
this	is	the	``	kniphausen	hawk	.	``
it	is	a	ceremonial	pouring	vessel	made	around	1700	for	a	swedish	count	,	and	it	is	very	likely	the	object	from	which	hammett	drew	his	inspiration	for	the	maltese	falcon	.
then	there	is	the	fictional	bird	,	the	one	that	hammett	created	for	the	book	.
built	out	of	words	,	it	is	the	engine	that	drives	the	plot	of	his	book	and	also	the	movie	,	in	which	another	object	is	created	:	a	prop	that	has	to	represent	the	thing	that	hammett	created	out	of	words	,	inspired	by	the	kniphausen	hawk	,	and	this	represents	the	falcon	in	the	movie	.
and	then	there	is	this	fourth	level	,	which	is	a	whole	new	object	in	the	world	:	the	prop	made	for	the	movie	,	the	representative	of	the	thing	,	becomes	,	in	its	own	right	,	a	whole	other	thing	,
a	whole	new	object	of	desire	.
and	so	now	it	was	time	to	do	some	research	.
i	actually	had	done	some	research	a	few	years	before	--	it	's	why	the	folder	was	there	.
i	'd	bought	a	replica	,	a	really	crappy	replica	,	of	the	maltese	falcon	on	ebay	,	and	had	downloaded	enough	pictures	to	actually	have	some	reasonable	reference	.
but	i	discovered	,	in	researching	further	,	really	wanting	precise	reference	,	that	one	of	the	original	lead	birds	had	been	sold	at	christie	's	in	1994	,	and	so	i	contacted	an	antiquarian	bookseller	who	had	the	original	christie	's	catalogue	,	and	in	it	i	found	this	magnificent	picture	,	which	included	a	size	reference	.
i	was	able	to	scan	the	picture	,	blow	it	up	to	exactly	full	size	.
i	found	other	reference	.	avi	[	ara	]	chekmayan	,	a	new	jersey	editor	,	actually	found	this	resin	maltese	falcon	at	a	flea	market	in	1991	,	although	it	took	him	five	years	to	authenticate	this	bird	to	the	auctioneers	'	specifications	,	because	there	was	a	lot	of	controversy	about	it	.
it	was	made	out	of	resin	,	which	was	n't	a	common	material	for	movie	props	about	the	time	the	movie	was	made	.
it	's	funny	to	me	that	it	took	a	while	to	authenticate	it	,	because	i	can	see	it	compared	to	this	thing	,	and	i	can	tell	you	--	it	's	real	,	it	's	the	real	thing	,
it	's	made	from	the	exact	same	mold	that	this	one	is	.
in	this	one	,	because	the	auction	was	actually	so	controversial	,	profiles	in	history	,	the	auction	house	that	sold	this	--	i	think	in	1995	for	about	100,000	dollars	--	they	actually	included	--	you	can	see	here	on	the	bottom	--	not	just	a	front	elevation	,	but	also	a	side	,	rear	and	other	side	elevation	.
so	now	,	i	had	all	the	topology	i	needed	to	replicate	the	maltese	falcon	.
what	do	they	do	,	how	do	you	start	something	like	that	?	i	really	do	n't	know	.
so	what	i	did	was	,	again	,	like	i	did	with	the	dodo	skull	,	i	blew	all	my	reference	up	to	full	size	,	and	then	i	began	cutting	out	the	negatives	and	using	those	templates	as	shape	references	.
so	i	took	sculpey	,	and	i	built	a	big	block	of	it	,	and	i	passed	it	through	until	,	you	know	,	i	got	the	right	profiles	.
and	then	slowly	,	feather	by	feather	,	detail	by	detail	,	i	worked	out	and	achieved	--	working	in	front	of	the	television	and	super	sculpey	--	here	's	me	sitting	next	to	my	wife	--	it	's	the	only	picture	i	took	of	the	entire	process	.
as	i	moved	through	,	i	achieved	a	very	reasonable	facsimile	of	the	maltese	falcon	.	but	again	,	i	am	not	a	sculptor	,	and	so	i	do	n't	know	a	lot	of	the	tricks	,	like	,	i	do	n't	know	how	my	friend	mike	gets	beautiful	,	shiny	surfaces	with	his	sculpey	;	i	certainly	was	n't	able	to	get	it	.
so	,	i	went	down	to	my	shop	,	and	i	molded	it	and	i	cast	it	in	resin	,	because	in	the	resin	,	then	,	i	could	absolutely	get	the	glass	smooth	finished	.
now	there	's	a	lot	of	ways	to	fill	and	get	yourself	a	nice	smooth	finish	.
my	preference	is	about	70	coats	of	this	--	matte	black	auto	primer	.	i	spray	it	on	for	about	three	or	four	days	,	it	drips	to	hell	,	but	it	allows	me	a	really	,	really	nice	gentle	sanding	surface	and	i	can	get	it	glass	-	smooth	.
oh	,	finishing	up	with	triple	-	zero	steel	wool	.
now	,	the	great	thing	about	getting	it	to	this	point	was	that	because	in	the	movie	,	when	they	finally	bring	out	the	bird	at	the	end	,	and	they	place	it	on	the	table	,	they	actually	spin	it	.
so	i	was	able	to	actually	screen	-	shot	and	freeze	-	frame	to	make	sure	.
and	i	'm	following	all	the	light	kicks	on	this	thing	and	making	sure	that	as	i	'm	holding	the	light	in	the	same	position	,	i	'm	getting	the	same	type	of	reflection	on	it	--	that	's	the	level	of	detail	i	'm	going	into	this	thing	.
i	ended	up	with	this	:	my	maltese	falcon	.
and	it	's	beautiful	.	and	i	can	state	with	authority	at	this	point	in	time	,	when	i	'd	finished	it	,	of	all	of	the	replicas	out	there	--	and	there	is	a	few	--	this	is	by	far	the	most	accurate	representation	of	the	original	maltese	falcon	than	anyone	has	sculpted	.	now	the	original	one	,	i	should	tell	you	,
is	sculpted	by	a	guy	named	fred	sexton	.
this	is	where	it	gets	weird	.
fred	sexton	was	a	friend	of	this	guy	,	george	hodel	.
terrifying	guy	--	agreed	by	many	to	be	the	killer	of	the	black	dahlia	.
now	,	james	ellroy	believes	that	fred	sexton	,	the	sculptor	of	the	maltese	falcon	,	killed	james	elroy	's	mother	.
i	'll	go	you	one	stranger	than	that	:	in	1974	,	during	the	production	of	a	weird	comedy	sequel	to	``	the	maltese	falcon	,	``	called	``	the	black	bird	,	``	starring	george	segal	,	the	los	angeles	county	museum	of	art	had	a	plaster	original	of	the	maltese	falcon	--	one	of	the	original	six	plasters	,	i	think	,	made	for	the	movie	--	stolen	out	of	the	museum	.	a	lot	of	people	thought	it	was	a	publicity	stunt	for	the	movie	.
john	's	grill	,	which	actually	is	seen	briefly	in	``	the	maltese	falcon	,	``	is	still	a	viable	san	francisco	eatery	,	counted	amongst	its	regular	customers	elisha	cook	,	who	played	wilmer	cook	in	the	movie	,	and	he	gave	them	one	of	his	original	plasters	of	the	maltese	falcon	.	and	they	had	it	in	their	cabinet	for	about	15	years	,	until	it	got	stolen	in	january	of	2007	.
it	would	seem	that	the	object	of	desire	only	comes	into	its	own	by	disappearing	repeatedly	.
so	here	i	had	this	falcon	,	and	it	was	lovely	.	it	looked	really	great	,	the	light	worked	on	it	really	well	,	it	was	better	than	anything	that	i	could	achieve	or	obtain	out	in	the	world	.
but	there	was	a	problem	.	and	the	problem	was	that	:	i	wanted	the	entirety	of	the	object	,	i	wanted	the	weight	behind	the	object	.
this	thing	was	made	of	resin	and	it	was	too	light	.
there	's	this	group	online	that	i	frequent	.
it	's	a	group	of	prop	crazies	just	like	me	called	the	replica	props	forum	,	and	it	's	people	who	trade	,	make	and	travel	in	information	about	movie	props	.
and	it	turned	out	that	one	of	the	guys	there	,	a	friend	of	mine	that	i	never	actually	met	,	but	befriended	through	some	prop	deals	,	was	the	manager	of	a	local	foundry	.
he	took	my	master	falcon	pattern	,	he	actually	did	lost	wax	casting	in	bronze	for	me	,	and	this	is	the	bronze	i	got	back	.
and	this	is	,	after	some	acid	etching	,	the	one	that	i	ended	up	with	.
and	this	thing	,	it	's	deeply	,	deeply	satisfying	to	me	.
here	,	i	'm	going	to	put	it	out	there	,	later	on	tonight	,	and
i	want	you	to	pick	it	up	and	handle	it	.
you	want	to	know	how	obsessed	i	am	.	this	project	's	only	for	me	,	and	yet	i	went	so	far	as	to	buy	on	ebay	a	1941	chinese	san	francisco	-	based	newspaper	,	in	order	so	that	the	bird	could	properly	be	wrapped	...
like	it	is	in	the	movie	.
yeah	,	i	know	!
there	you	can	see	,	it	's	weighing	in	at	27	and	a	half	pounds	.
that	's	half	the	weight	of	my	dog	,	huxley	.
but	there	's	a	problem	.
now	,	here	's	the	most	recent	progression	of	falcons	.
on	the	far	left	is	a	piece	of	crap	--	a	replica	i	bought	on	ebay	.
there	's	my	somewhat	ruined	sculpey	falcon	,	because	i	had	to	get	it	back	out	of	the	mold	.	there	's	my	first	casting	,	there	's	my	master	and	there	's	my	bronze	.
there	's	a	thing	that	happens	when	you	mold	and	cast	things	,	which	is	that	every	time	you	throw	it	into	silicone	and	cast	it	in	resin	,	you	lose	a	little	bit	of	volume	,	you	lose	a	little	bit	of	size	.
and	when	i	held	my	bronze	one	up	against	my	sculpey	one	,	it	was	shorter	by	three	-	quarters	of	an	inch	.
yeah	,	no	,	really	,	this	was	like	aah	--	why	did	n't	i	remember	this	?
why	did	n't	i	start	and	make	it	bigger	?
so	what	do	i	do	?	i	figure	i	have	two	options	.
one	,	i	can	fire	a	freaking	laser	at	it	,	which	i	have	already	done	,	to	do	a	3d	scan	--	there	's	a	3d	scan	of	this	falcon	.
i	had	figured	out	the	exact	amount	of	shrinkage	i	achieved	going	from	a	wax	master	to	a	bronze	master	and	blown	this	up	big	enough	to	make	which	i	will	polish	,	then	i	will	send	to	the	mold	maker	and	then	i	will	have	it	done	in	bronze	.	or	:	there	are	several	people	who	own	originals	,	and	i	have	been	attempting	to	contact	them	and	reach	them	,	hoping	that	they	will	let	me	spend	a	few	minutes	in	the	presence	of	one	of	the	real	birds	,	maybe	to	take	a	picture	,	or	even	to	pull	out	the	hand	-	held	laser	scanner	that	i	happen	to	own	that	fits	inside	a	cereal	box	,	and	could	maybe	,	without	even	touching	their	bird	,	i	swear	,	get	a	perfect	3d	scan	.	and	i	'm	even	willing	to	sign	pages	saying	that	i	'll	never	let	anyone	else	have	it	,	except	for	me	in	my	office	,	i	promise	.
i	'll	give	them	one	if	they	want	it	.
and	then	,	maybe	,	then	i	'll	achieve	the	end	of	this	exercise	.
but	really	,	if	we	're	all	going	to	be	honest	with	ourselves	,	i	have	to	admit	that	achieving	the	end	of	the	exercise	was	never	the	point	of	the	exercise	to	begin	with	,	was	it	.
thank	you	.
