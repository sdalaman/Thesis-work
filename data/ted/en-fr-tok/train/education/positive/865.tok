i	was	here	four	years	ago	,	and	i	remember	,	at	the	time	,	that	the	talks	were	n't	put	online	.	i	think	they	were	given	to	tedsters	in	a	box	,	a	box	set	of	dvds	,	which	they	put	on	their	shelves	,	where	they	are	now	.
and	actually	,	chris	called	me	a	week	after	i	'd	given	my	talk	and	he	said	,	``	we	're	going	to	start	putting	them	online	.
can	we	put	yours	online	?	``	and	i	said	,	``	sure	.	``
and	four	years	later	,	as	i	said	,	it	's	been	seen	by	four	...
well	,	it	's	been	downloaded	four	million	times	.
so	i	suppose	you	could	multiply	that	by	20	or	something	to	get	the	number	of	people	who	've	seen	it	.
and	,	as	chris	says	,	there	is	a	hunger	for	videos	of	me	.
...	do	n't	you	feel	?
so	,	this	whole	event	has	been	an	elaborate	build	-	up	to	me	doing	another	one	for	you	,	so	here	it	is	.
al	gore	spoke	at	the	ted	conference	i	spoke	at	four	years	ago	and	talked	about	the	climate	crisis	.
and	i	referenced	that	at	the	end	of	my	last	talk	.
so	i	want	to	pick	up	from	there	because	i	only	had	18	minutes	,	frankly	.
so	,	as	i	was	saying	...
you	see	,	he	's	right	.
i	mean	,	there	is	a	major	climate	crisis	,	obviously	,
and	i	think	if	people	do	n't	believe	it	,	they	should	get	out	more	.	but	i	believe	there	's	a	second	climate	crisis	,	which	is	as	severe	,	which	has	the	same	origins	,	and	that	we	have	to	deal	with	with	the	same	urgency	.
and	i	mean	by	this	--	and	you	may	say	,	by	the	way	,	``	look	,	i	'm	good	.	i	have	one	climate	crisis	;	i	do	n't	really	need	the	second	one	.	``
but	this	is	a	crisis	of	,	not	natural	resources	--	though	i	believe	that	's	true	--	but	a	crisis	of	human	resources	.
i	believe	fundamentally	,	as	many	speakers	have	said	during	the	past	few	days	,	that	we	make	very	poor	use	of	our	talents	.
very	many	people	go	through	their	whole	lives	having	no	real	sense	of	what	their	talents	may	be	,	or	if	they	have	any	to	speak	of	.
i	meet	all	kinds	of	people	who	do	n't	think	they	're	really	good	at	anything	.
actually	,	i	kind	of	divide	the	world	into	two	groups	now	.
jeremy	bentham	,	the	great	utilitarian	philosopher	,	once	spiked	this	argument	.	he	said	,	``	there	are	two	types	of	people	in	this	world	:	those	who	divide	the	world	into	two	types	and	those	who	do	not	.	``
well	,	i	do	.
i	meet	all	kinds	of	people	who	do	n't	enjoy	what	they	do	.
they	simply	go	through	their	lives	getting	on	with	it	.
they	get	no	great	pleasure	from	what	they	do	.
they	endure	it	rather	than	enjoy	it	and	wait	for	the	weekend	.
but	i	also	meet	people	who	love	what	they	do	and	could	n't	imagine	doing	anything	else	.
if	you	said	to	them	,	``	do	n't	do	this	anymore	,	``	they	'd	wonder	what	you	were	talking	about	.
because	it	is	n't	what	they	do	,	it	's	who	they	are	.	they	say	,	``	but	this	is	me	,	you	know	.
it	would	be	foolish	for	me	to	abandon	this	,	because	it	speaks	to	my	most	authentic	self	.	``
and	it	's	not	true	of	enough	people	.
in	fact	,	on	the	contrary	,	i	think	it	's	still	true	of	a	minority	of	people	.
i	think	there	are	many	possible	explanations	for	it	.
and	high	among	them	is	education	,	because	education	,	in	a	way	,	dislocates	very	many	people	from	their	natural	talents	.
and	human	resources	are	like	natural	resources	;	they	're	often	buried	deep	.
you	have	to	go	looking	for	them	,
they	're	not	just	lying	around	on	the	surface	.
you	have	to	create	the	circumstances	where	they	show	themselves	.
and	you	might	imagine	education	would	be	the	way	that	happens	,
but	too	often	it	's	not	.
every	education	system	in	the	world	is	being	reformed	at	the	moment	and	it	's	not	enough	.
reform	is	no	use	anymore	,	because	that	's	simply	improving	a	broken	model	.
what	we	need	--	and	the	word	's	been	used	many	times	during	the	course	of	the	past	few	days	--	is	not	evolution	,	but	a	revolution	in	education	.
this	has	to	be	transformed	into	something	else	.
one	of	the	real	challenges	is	to	innovate	fundamentally	in	education	.
innovation	is	hard	because	it	means	doing	something	that	people	do	n't	find	very	easy	,	for	the	most	part	.
it	means	challenging	what	we	take	for	granted	,	things	that	we	think	are	obvious	.
the	great	problem	for	reform	or	transformation	is	the	tyranny	of	common	sense	;	things	that	people	think	,	``	well	,	it	ca	n't	be	done	any	other	way	because	that	's	the	way	it	's	done	.	``
i	came	across	a	great	quote	recently	from	abraham	lincoln	,	who	i	thought	you	'd	be	pleased	to	have	quoted	at	this	point	.
he	said	this	in	december	1862	to	the	second	annual	meeting	of	congress	.
i	ought	to	explain	that	i	have	no	idea	what	was	happening	at	the	time	.
we	do	n't	teach	american	history	in	britain	.
we	suppress	it	.	you	know	,	this	is	our	policy	.
so	,	no	doubt	,	something	fascinating	was	happening	in	december	1862	,	which	the	americans	among	us	will	be	aware	of	.
but	he	said	this	:	``	the	dogmas	of	the	quiet	past	are	inadequate	to	the	stormy	present	.
the	occasion	is	piled	high	with	difficulty	,	and	we	must	rise	with	the	occasion	.	``
i	love	that	.
not	rise	to	it	,	rise	with	it	.
``	as	our	case	is	new	,	so	we	must	think	anew	and	act	anew	.	we	must	disenthrall	ourselves	,	and	then	we	shall	save	our	country	.	``
i	love	that	word	,	``	disenthrall	.	``	you	know	what	it	means	?
that	there	are	ideas	that	all	of	us	are	enthralled	to	,	which	we	simply	take	for	granted	as	the	natural	order	of	things	,	the	way	things	are	.
and	many	of	our	ideas	have	been	formed	,	not	to	meet	the	circumstances	of	this	century	,	but	to	cope	with	the	circumstances	of	previous	centuries	.
but	our	minds	are	still	hypnotized	by	them	,
and	we	have	to	disenthrall	ourselves	of	some	of	them	.
now	,	doing	this	is	easier	said	than	done	.
it	's	very	hard	to	know	,	by	the	way	,	what	it	is	you	take	for	granted	.
and	the	reason	is	that	you	take	it	for	granted	.
so	let	me	ask	you	something	you	may	take	for	granted	.
how	many	of	you	here	are	over	the	age	of	25	?
that	's	not	what	i	think	you	take	for	granted	,
i	'm	sure	you	're	familiar	with	that	already	.
are	there	any	people	here	under	the	age	of	25	?
great	.	now	,	those	over	25	,	could	you	put	your	hands	up	if	you	're	wearing	your	wristwatch	?
now	that	's	a	great	deal	of	us	,	is	n't	it	?
ask	a	room	full	of	teenagers	the	same	thing	.
teenagers	do	not	wear	wristwatches	.
i	do	n't	mean	they	ca	n't	or	they	're	not	allowed	to	,	they	just	often	choose	not	to	.
and	the	reason	is	,	you	see	,	that	we	were	brought	up	in	a	pre	-	digital	culture	,	those	of	us	over	25	.
and	so	for	us	,	if	you	want	to	know	the	time	you	have	to	wear	something	to	tell	it	.
kids	now	live	in	a	world	which	is	digitized	,	and	the	time	,	for	them	,	is	everywhere	.
they	see	no	reason	to	do	this	.
and	by	the	way	,	you	do	n't	need	to	do	it	either	;	it	's	just	that	you	've	always	done	it	and	you	carry	on	doing	it	.
my	daughter	never	wears	a	watch	,	my	daughter	kate	,	who	's	20	.
she	does	n't	see	the	point	.
as	she	says	,	``	it	's	a	single	function	device	.	``
``	like	,	how	lame	is	that	?	``
and	i	say	,	``	no	,	no	,	it	tells	the	date	as	well	.	``
``	it	has	multiple	functions	.	``
but	,	you	see	,	there	are	things	we	're	enthralled	to	in	education	.
let	me	give	you	a	couple	of	examples	.
one	of	them	is	the	idea	of	linearity	:	that	it	starts	here	and	you	go	through	a	track	and	if	you	do	everything	right	,	you	will	end	up	set	for	the	rest	of	your	life	.
everybody	who	's	spoken	at	ted	has	told	us	implicitly	,	or	sometimes	explicitly	,	a	different	story	:	that	life	is	not	linear	;	it	's	organic	.
we	create	our	lives	symbiotically	as	we	explore	our	talents	in	relation	to	the	circumstances	they	help	to	create	for	us	.	but	,	you	know	,	we	have	become	obsessed	with	this	linear	narrative	.
and	probably	the	pinnacle	for	education	is	getting	you	to	college	.
i	think	we	are	obsessed	with	getting	people	to	college	.	certain	sorts	of	college	.
i	do	n't	mean	you	should	n't	go	to	college	,	but	not	everybody	needs	to	go	and	not	everybody	needs	to	go	now	.
maybe	they	go	later	,	not	right	away	.
and	i	was	up	in	san	francisco	a	while	ago	doing	a	book	signing	.
there	was	this	guy	buying	a	book	,	he	was	in	his	30s	.
and	i	said	,	``	what	do	you	do	?	``
and	he	said	,	``	i	'm	a	fireman	.	``
and	i	said	,	``	how	long	have	you	been	a	fireman	?	``
he	said	,	``	always	.	i	've	always	been	a	fireman	.	``
and	i	said	,	``	well	,	when	did	you	decide	?	``
he	said	,	``	as	a	kid	.	``	he	said	,	``	actually	,	it	was	a	problem	for	me	at	school	,	because	at	school	,	everybody	wanted	to	be	a	fireman	.	``
he	said	,	``	but	i	wanted	to	be	a	fireman	.	``
and	he	said	,	``	when	i	got	to	the	senior	year	of	school	,	my	teachers	did	n't	take	it	seriously	.
this	one	teacher	did	n't	take	it	seriously	.
he	said	i	was	throwing	my	life	away	if	that	's	all	i	chose	to	do	with	it	;	that	i	should	go	to	college	,	i	should	become	a	professional	person	,	that	i	had	great	potential	and	i	was	wasting	my	talent	to	do	that	.	``
and	he	said	,	``	it	was	humiliating	because	he	said	it	in	front	of	the	whole	class	and	i	really	felt	dreadful	.
but	it	's	what	i	wanted	,	and	as	soon	as	i	left	school	,	i	applied	to	the	fire	service	and	i	was	accepted	.	``
and	he	said	,	``	you	know	,	i	was	thinking	about	that	guy	recently	,	just	a	few	minutes	ago	when	you	were	speaking	,	about	this	teacher	,	``
he	said	,	``	because	six	months	ago	,	i	saved	his	life	.	``
he	said	,	``	he	was	in	a	car	wreck	,	and	i	pulled	him	out	,	gave	him	cpr	,	and	i	saved	his	wife	's	life	as	well	.	``
he	said	,	``	i	think	he	thinks	better	of	me	now	.	``
you	know	,	to	me	,	human	communities	depend	upon	a	diversity	of	talent	,	not	a	singular	conception	of	ability	.
and	at	the	heart	of	our	challenges	--	at	the	heart	of	the	challenge	is	to	reconstitute	our	sense	of	ability	and	of	intelligence	.
this	linearity	thing	is	a	problem	.
when	i	arrived	in	l.a.	about	nine	years	ago	,	i	came	across	a	policy	statement	--	very	well	-	intentioned	--	which	said	,	``	college	begins	in	kindergarten	.	``
no	,	it	does	n't	.
it	does	n't	.
if	we	had	time	,	i	could	go	into	this	,	but	we	do	n't	.
kindergarten	begins	in	kindergarten	.
a	friend	of	mine	once	said	,	``	you	know	,	a	three	year	-	old	is	not	half	a	six	year	-	old	.	``
they	're	three	.
but	as	we	just	heard	in	this	last	session	,	there	's	such	competition	now	to	get	into	kindergarten	--	to	get	to	the	right	kindergarten	--	that	people	are	being	interviewed	for	it	at	three	.
kids	sitting	in	front	of	unimpressed	panels	,	you	know	,	with	their	resumes	,	flipping	through	and	saying	,	``	well	,	this	is	it	?	``
``	you	've	been	around	for	36	months	,	and	this	is	it	?	``
``	you	've	achieved	nothing	--	commit	.
spent	the	first	six	months	breastfeeding	,	the	way	i	can	see	it	.	``
see	,	it	's	outrageous	as	a	conception	,	but	it	[	unclear	]	.
the	other	big	issue	is	conformity	.
we	have	built	our	education	systems	on	the	model	of	fast	food	.
this	is	something	jamie	oliver	talked	about	the	other	day	.
you	know	there	are	two	models	of	quality	assurance	in	catering	.
one	is	fast	food	,	where	everything	is	standardized	.
the	other	are	things	like	zagat	and	michelin	restaurants	,	where	everything	is	not	standardized	,	they	're	customized	to	local	circumstances	.
and	we	have	sold	ourselves	into	a	fast	food	model	of	education	,
and	it	's	impoverishing	our	spirit	and	our	energies	as	much	as	fast	food	is	depleting	our	physical	bodies	.
i	think	we	have	to	recognize	a	couple	of	things	here	.
one	is	that	human	talent	is	tremendously	diverse	.
people	have	very	different	aptitudes	.
i	worked	out	recently	that	i	was	given	a	guitar	as	a	kid	at	about	the	same	time	that	eric	clapton	got	his	first	guitar	.
you	know	,	it	worked	out	for	eric	,	that	's	all	i	'm	saying	.
in	a	way	,	it	did	not	for	me	.
i	could	not	get	this	thing	to	work	no	matter	how	often	or	how	hard	i	blew	into	it	.
it	just	would	n't	work	.
but	it	's	not	only	about	that	.
it	's	about	passion	.
often	,	people	are	good	at	things	they	do	n't	really	care	for	.
it	's	about	passion	,	and	what	excites	our	spirit	and	our	energy	.
and	if	you	're	doing	the	thing	that	you	love	to	do	,	that	you	're	good	at	,	time	takes	a	different	course	entirely	.
my	wife	's	just	finished	writing	a	novel	,	and	i	think	it	's	a	great	book	,	but	she	disappears	for	hours	on	end	.
you	know	this	,	if	you	're	doing	something	you	love	,	an	hour	feels	like	five	minutes	.
if	you	're	doing	something	that	does	n't	resonate	with	your	spirit	,	five	minutes	feels	like	an	hour	.
and	the	reason	so	many	people	are	opting	out	of	education	is	because	it	does	n't	feed	their	spirit	,	it	does	n't	feed	their	energy	or	their	passion	.
so	i	think	we	have	to	change	metaphors	.
we	have	to	go	from	what	is	essentially	an	industrial	model	of	education	,	a	manufacturing	model	,	which	is	based	on	linearity	and	conformity	and	batching	people	.
we	have	to	move	to	a	model	that	is	based	more	on	principles	of	agriculture	.
we	have	to	recognize	that	human	flourishing	is	not	a	mechanical	process	;	it	's	an	organic	process	.
and	you	can	not	predict	the	outcome	of	human	development	.	all	you	can	do	,	like	a	farmer	,	is	create	the	conditions	under	which	they	will	begin	to	flourish	.
so	when	we	look	at	reforming	education	and	transforming	it	,	it	is	n't	like	cloning	a	system	.
there	are	great	ones	,	like	kipp	's	;	it	's	a	great	system	.
there	are	many	great	models	.
it	's	about	customizing	to	your	circumstances	and	personalizing	education	to	the	people	you	're	actually	teaching	.	and	doing	that	,	i	think	,	is	the	answer	to	the	future	because	it	's	not	about	scaling	a	new	solution	;	it	's	about	creating	a	movement	in	education	in	which	people	develop	their	own	solutions	,	but	with	external	support	based	on	a	personalized	curriculum	.
now	in	this	room	,	there	are	people	who	represent	extraordinary	resources	in	business	,	in	multimedia	,	in	the	internet	.
these	technologies	,	combined	with	the	extraordinary	talents	of	teachers	,	provide	an	opportunity	to	revolutionize	education	.
and	i	urge	you	to	get	involved	in	it	because	it	's	vital	,	not	just	to	ourselves	,	but	to	the	future	of	our	children	.
but	we	have	to	change	from	the	industrial	model	to	an	agricultural	model	,	where	each	school	can	be	flourishing	tomorrow	.
that	's	where	children	experience	life	.
or	at	home	,	if	that	's	where	they	choose	to	be	educated	with	their	families	or	their	friends	.
there	's	been	a	lot	of	talk	about	dreams	over	the	course	of	this	few	days	.
and	i	wanted	to	just	very	quickly	...	i	was	very	struck	by	natalie	merchant	's	songs	last	night	,	recovering	old	poems	.
i	wanted	to	read	you	a	quick	,	very	short	poem	from	w.	b.	yeats	,	who	some	of	you	may	know	.
he	wrote	this	to	his	love	,	maud	gonne	,	and	he	was	bewailing	the	fact	that	he	could	n't	really	give	her	what	he	thought	she	wanted	from	him	.	and	he	says	,	``	i	've	got	something	else	,	but	it	may	not	be	for	you	.	``
he	says	this	:	``	had	i	the	heavens	'	embroidered	cloths	,	enwrought	with	gold	and	silver	light	,	the	blue	and	the	dim	and	the	dark	cloths	of	night	and	light	and	the	half	-	light	,	i	would	spread	the	cloths	under	your	feet	:	but	i	,	being	poor	,	have	only	my	dreams	;	i	have	spread	my	dreams	under	your	feet	;	tread	softly	because	you	tread	on	my	dreams	.	``
and	every	day	,	everywhere	,	our	children	spread	their	dreams	beneath	our	feet	.
and	we	should	tread	softly	.
thank	you	.
thank	you	very	much	.
