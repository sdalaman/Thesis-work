host	:	folks	,	you	've	just	met	claron	mcfadden	.
she	is	a	world	-	class	soprano	singer	who	studied	in	rochester	,	new	york	.
her	celebrated	operatic	roles	are	numerous	and	varied	.
in	august	2007	,	claron	was	awarded	the	amsterdam	prize	for	the	arts	,	winning	praise	for	her	brilliance	,	her	amazing	and	extensively	wide	repertoire	and	her	vivid	stage	personality	.
please	welcome	claron	mcfadden	.
claron	mcfadden	:	the	human	voice	:	mysterious	,	spontaneous	,	primal	.
for	me	,	the	human	voice	is	the	vessel	on	which	all	emotions	travel	--	except	perhaps	jealousy	.
and	the	breath	,	the	breath	is	the	captain	of	that	vessel	.
a	child	is	born	,	takes	its	first	breath	--	and	we	behold	the	wondrous	beauty	of	vocal	expression	--	mysterious	,	spontaneous	and	primal	.
a	few	years	ago	,	i	did	a	meditation	retreat	in	thailand	.
i	wanted	a	place	that	i	would	have	total	silence	and	total	solitude	.
i	spent	two	weeks	at	this	retreat	in	my	own	little	hut	--	no	music	,	no	nothing	,	sounds	of	nature	--	trying	to	find	the	essence	of	concentration	,	being	in	the	moment	.
on	my	last	day	,	the	woman	who	looked	after	the	place	,	she	came	and	we	spoke	for	a	minute	,	and	then	she	said	to	me	,	``	would	you	sing	something	for	me	?	``
and	i	thought	,	but	this	is	a	place	of	total	quiet	and	silence	.	i	ca	n't	make	noise	.
she	said	,	``	please	,	sing	for	me	.	``
so	i	closed	my	eyes	,	i	took	breath	and	the	first	thing	that	came	up	and	out	was	``	summertime	,	``	porgy	and	bess	.
♫	summertime	and	the	living	is	easy	♫	♫	fish	are	jumping	and	the	cotton	is	high	♫	♫	oh	,	your	daddy	's	rich	and	your	ma	is	good	-	looking	♫	♫	so	hush	little	baby	♫	♫	do	n't	you	cry	♫	and	i	opened	my	eyes	,	and	i	saw	that	she	had	her	eyes	closed	.
and	after	a	moment	,	she	opened	her	eyes	and	she	looked	at	me	and	she	said	,	``	it	's	like	meditation	.	``
and	in	that	moment	i	understood	that	everything	i	had	gone	to	thailand	to	look	for	,	to	search	for	,	i	had	it	already	in	my	singing	--	the	calm	,	but	alertness	,	the	focus	,	but	awareness	,	and	being	totally	in	the	moment	.
when	you	're	totally	in	the	moment	,	when	i	'm	totally	in	the	moment	,	the	vessel	of	expression	is	open	.
the	emotions	can	flow	from	me	to	you	and	back	.
extremely	profound	experience	.
there	's	a	piece	by	a	composer	,	an	american	composer	called	john	cage	.
it	's	called	``	aria	.	``
it	was	written	for	an	amazing	singer	called	cathy	berberian	.	and	the	thing	about	this	piece	that	's	so	special	--	if	you	see	it	behind	me	--	it	's	not	notated	in	any	way	.
no	notes	,	no	flats	,	no	sharps	.
but	it	's	a	kind	of	structure	,	and	the	singer	within	this	structure	has	total	freedom	to	be	creative	,	spontaneous	.
for	example	,	there	are	different	colors	and	each	color	gets	a	different	type	of	singing	--	pop	,	country	and	western	,	opera	,	jazz	--	and	you	just	have	to	be	consistent	with	that	color	.
you	see	there	are	different	lines	:	you	choose	in	your	own	tempo	in	your	own	way	to	follow	the	line	,	but	you	must	respect	it	,	more	or	less	.
and	these	little	dots	,	these	represent	a	sort	of	sound	that	's	not	a	vocal	,	not	a	lyrical	way	of	expressing	the	voice	.
using	the	body	--	it	could	be	sneezing	,	it	could	be	coughing	,	it	could	be	animals	--	exactly	--	clapping	,	whatever	.
and	there	's	different	text	.
there	's	armenian	,	russian	,	french	,	english	,	italian	.
so	within	this	structure	one	is	free	.
to	me	,	this	piece	is	an	ode	to	the	voice	because	it	's	mysterious	--	as	we	can	see	--	it	's	quite	spontaneous	,	and	it	's	primal	.
so	i	would	like	to	share	this	piece	with	you	.
it	's	``	aria	``	of	john	cage	.
