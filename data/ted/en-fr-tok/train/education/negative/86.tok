on	september	10	,	the	morning	of	my	seventh	birthday	,	i	came	downstairs	to	the	kitchen	,	where	my	mother	was	washing	the	dishes	and	my	father	was	reading	the	paper	or	something	,	and	i	sort	of	presented	myself	to	them	in	the	doorway	,	and	they	said	,	``	hey	,	happy	birthday	!	``	and	i	said	,	``	i	'm	seven	.	``
and	my	father	smiled	and	said	,	``	well	,	you	know	what	that	means	,	do	n't	you	?	``
and	i	said	,	``	yeah	,	that	i	'm	going	to	have	a	party	and	a	cake	and	get	a	lot	of	presents	?	``	and	my	dad	said	,	``	well	,	yes	.	but	,	more	importantly	,	being	seven	means	that	you	've	reached	the	age	of	reason	,	and	you	're	now	capable	of	committing	any	and	all	sins	against	god	and	man	.	``
now	,	i	had	heard	this	phrase	,	``	age	of	reason	,	``	before	.	sister	mary	kevin	had	been	bandying	it	about	my	second	-	grade	class	at	school	.	but	when	she	said	it	,	the	phrase	seemed	all	caught	up	in	the	excitement	of	preparations	for	our	first	communion	and	our	first	confession	,	and	everybody	knew	that	was	really	all	about	the	white	dress	and	the	white	veil	,	and	anyway	,	i	had	n't	really	paid	all	that	much	attention	to	that	phrase	,	``	age	of	reason	.	``	so	,	i	said	,	``	yeah	,	yeah	,	age	of	reason	.	what	does	that	mean	again	?	``
and	my	dad	said	,	``	well	,	we	believe	in	the	catholic	church	that	god	knows	that	little	kids	do	n't	know	the	difference	between	right	and	wrong	,	but	when	you	're	seven	,	you	're	old	enough	to	know	better	.
so	,	you	've	grown	up	,	and	reached	the	age	of	reason	,	and	now	god	will	start	keeping	notes	on	you	and	begin	your	permanent	record	.	``
and	i	said	,	``	oh	.	wait	a	minute	.	you	mean	all	that	time	,	up	till	today	,	all	that	time	i	was	so	good	,	god	did	n't	notice	it	?	``
and	my	mom	said	,	``	well	,	i	noticed	it	.	``	and	i	thought	,	``	how	could	i	not	have	known	this	before	?
how	could	it	not	have	sunk	in	when	they	'd	been	telling	me	?
all	that	being	good	and	no	real	credit	for	it	.
and	,	worst	of	all	,	how	could	i	not	have	realized	this	very	important	information	until	the	very	day	that	it	was	basically	useless	to	me	?	``	so	i	said	,	``	well	,	mom	and	dad	,	what	about	santa	claus	?
i	mean	,	santa	claus	knows	if	you	're	naughty	or	nice	,	right	?	``
and	my	dad	said	,	``	yeah	,	but	,	honey	,	i	think	that	's	technically	just	between	thanksgiving	and	christmas	.	``
and	my	mother	said	,	``	oh	,	bob	,	stop	it	.	let	's	just	tell	her	.
i	mean	,	she	's	seven	.	julie	,	there	is	no	santa	claus	.	``
now	,	this	was	actually	not	that	upsetting	to	me	.
my	parents	had	this	whole	elaborate	story	about	santa	claus	:	how	they	had	talked	to	santa	claus	himself	and	agreed	that	instead	of	santa	delivering	our	presents	over	the	night	of	christmas	eve	,	like	he	did	for	every	other	family	who	got	to	open	their	surprises	first	thing	christmas	morning	,	our	family	would	give	santa	more	time	.	santa	would	come	to	our	house	while	we	were	at	nine	o'clock	high	mass	on	christmas	morning	,	but	only	if	all	of	us	kids	did	not	make	a	fuss	.	which	made	me	very	suspicious	.
it	was	pretty	obvious	that	it	was	really	our	parents	giving	us	the	presents	.
i	mean	,	my	dad	had	a	very	distinctive	wrapping	style	,	and	my	mother	's	handwriting	was	so	close	to	santa	's	.
plus	,	why	would	santa	save	time	by	having	to	loop	back	to	our	house	after	he	'd	gone	to	everybody	else	's	?
there	's	only	one	obvious	conclusion	to	reach	from	this	mountain	of	evidence	:	our	family	was	too	strange	and	weird	for	even	santa	claus	to	come	visit	,	and	my	poor	parents	were	trying	to	protect	us	from	the	embarrassment	,	this	humiliation	of	rejection	by	santa	,	who	was	jolly	--	but	,	let	's	face	it	,	he	was	also	very	judgmental	.
so	,	to	find	out	that	there	was	no	santa	claus	at	all	was	actually	sort	of	a	relief	.
i	left	the	kitchen	not	really	in	shock	about	santa	,	but	rather	i	was	just	dumbfounded	about	how	i	could	have	missed	this	whole	age	of	reason	thing	.
it	was	too	late	for	me	,	but	maybe	i	could	help	someone	else	,	someone	who	could	use	the	information	.
they	had	to	fit	two	criteria	:	they	had	to	be	old	enough	to	be	able	to	understand	the	whole	concept	of	the	age	of	reason	,	and	not	yet	seven	.
the	answer	was	clear	:	my	brother	bill	.	he	was	six	.
well	,	i	finally	found	bill	about	a	block	away	from	our	house	at	this	public	school	playground	.	it	was	a	saturday	,	and	he	was	all	by	himself	,	just	kicking	a	ball	against	the	side	of	a	wall	.
i	ran	up	to	him	and	said	,	``	bill	!
i	just	realized	that	the	age	of	reason	starts	when	you	turn	seven	,	and	then	you	're	capable	of	committing	any	and	all	sins	against	god	and	man	.	``	and	bill	said	,	``	so	?	``	and	then	i	said	,	``	so	,	you	're	six	.	you	have	a	whole	year	to	do	anything	you	want	to	and	god	wo	n't	notice	it	.	``	and	he	said	,	``	so	?	``	and	i	said	,	``	so	?	so	everything	!	``	and	i	turned	to	run	.	i	was	so	angry	with	him	.	but	when	i	got	to	the	top	of	the	steps	,	i	turned	around	dramatically	and	said	,	``	oh	,	by	the	way	,	bill	,	there	is	no	santa	claus	.	``	now	,	i	did	n't	know	it	at	the	time	,	but	i	really	was	n't	turning	seven	on	september	10	.
for	my	13th	birthday	,	i	planned	a	slumber	party	with	all	of	my	girlfriends	,	but	a	couple	of	weeks	beforehand	my	mother	took	me	aside	and	said	,	``	i	need	to	speak	to	you	privately	.
september	10	is	not	your	birthday	.	it	's	october	10.	``	and	i	said	,	``	what	?	``
and	she	said	,	``	listen	.	the	cut	-	off	date	to	start	kindergarten	was	september	15.	``	``	so	,	i	told	them	that	your	birthday	was	on	september	10	,	and	then	i	was	n't	sure	that	you	were	n't	just	going	to	go	blab	it	all	over	the	place	,	so	i	started	to	tell	you	your	birthday	was	september	10	.
but	,	julie	,	you	were	so	ready	to	start	school	,	honey	.	you	were	so	ready	.	``	i	thought	about	it	,	and	when	i	was	four	,	i	was	already	the	oldest	of	four	children	,	and	my	mother	even	had	another	child	to	come	,	so	what	i	think	she	understandably	really	meant	was	that	she	was	so	ready	,	she	was	so	ready	.	then	she	said	,	``	do	n't	worry	,	julie	,	every	year	on	october	10	when	it	was	your	birthday	but	you	did	n't	realize	it	,	i	made	sure	that	you	ate	a	piece	of	cake	that	day	.	``
which	was	comforting	,	but	troubling	.
my	mother	had	been	celebrating	my	birthday	with	me	,	without	me	.
what	was	so	upsetting	about	this	new	piece	of	information	was	not	that	i	was	going	to	have	to	change	the	date	of	my	slumber	party	with	all	of	my	girlfriends	,	what	was	most	upsetting	was	that	this	meant	that	i	was	not	a	virgo	.
i	had	a	huge	virgo	poster	in	my	bedroom	,	and	i	read	my	horoscope	every	single	day	,	and	it	was	so	totally	me	.
and	this	meant	that	i	was	a	libra	?
so	,	i	took	the	bus	downtown	to	get	the	new	libra	poster	.
the	virgo	poster	is	a	picture	of	a	beautiful	woman	with	long	hair	,	sort	of	lounging	by	some	water	,	but	the	libra	poster	is	just	a	huge	scale	.
this	was	around	the	time	that	i	started	filling	out	physically	,	and	i	was	filling	out	a	lot	more	than	a	lot	of	the	other	girls	,	and	,	frankly	,	the	whole	idea	that	my	astrological	sign	was	a	scale	just	seemed	ominous	and	depressing	.
but	i	got	the	new	libra	poster	,	and	i	started	to	read	my	new	libra	horoscope	,	and	i	was	astonished	to	find	that	it	was	also	totally	me	.	it	was	n't	until	years	later	,	looking	back	on	this	whole	age	-	of	-	reason	/	change	-	of	-	birthday	thing	,	that	it	dawned	on	me	:	i	was	n't	turning	seven	when	i	thought	i	turned	seven	.	i	had	a	whole	other	month	to	do	anything	i	wanted	to	before	god	started	keeping	tabs	on	me	.
oh	,	life	can	be	so	cruel	.
one	day	,	two	mormon	missionaries	came	to	my	door	.
now	,	i	just	live	off	a	main	thoroughfare	in	los	angeles	,	and	my	block	is	--	well	,	it	's	a	natural	beginning	for	people	who	are	peddling	things	door	to	door	.
sometimes	i	get	little	old	ladies	from	the	seventh	day	adventist	church	showing	me	these	cartoon	pictures	of	heaven	.
and	sometimes	i	get	teenagers	who	promise	me	that	they	wo	n't	join	a	gang	and	just	start	robbing	people	if	i	only	buy	some	magazine	subscriptions	from	them	.
so	,	normally	i	just	ignore	the	doorbell	,	but	on	this	day	i	answered	.
and	there	stood	two	boys	,	each	about	19	,	in	white	starched	short	-	sleeved	shirts	,	and	they	had	little	name	tags	that	identified	them	as	official	representatives	of	the	church	of	jesus	christ	of	latter	-	day	saints	,
and	they	said	they	had	a	message	for	me	from	god	.
i	said	,	``	a	message	for	me	?	from	god	?	``	and	they	said	,	``	yes	.	``
now	,	i	was	raised	in	the	pacific	northwest	,	around	a	lot	of	church	of	latter	-	day	saints	people	and	,	you	know	,	i	've	worked	with	them	and	even	dated	them	,
but	i	never	really	knew	the	doctrine	or	what	they	said	to	people	when	they	were	out	on	a	mission	,	and	i	guess	i	was	,	sort	of	,	curious	,	so	i	said	,	``	well	,	please	,	come	in	.	``	and	they	looked	really	happy	,	because	i	do	n't	think	this	happens	to	them	all	that	often	.
and	i	sat	them	down	,	and	i	got	them	glasses	of	water	--	ok	,	i	got	it	.	i	got	them	glasses	of	water	.
do	n't	touch	my	hair	,	that	's	the	thing	.
you	ca	n't	put	a	video	of	myself	in	front	of	me	and	expect	me	not	to	fix	my	hair	.
ok	.	so	i	sat	them	down	and	i	got	them	glasses	of	water	,	and	after	niceties	they	said	,	``	do	you	believe	that	god	loves	you	with	all	his	heart	?	``
and	i	thought	,	``	well	,	of	course	i	believe	in	god	,	but	,	you	know	,	i	do	n't	like	that	word	,	heart	,	because	it	anthropomorphizes	god	,	and	i	do	n't	like	the	word	,	'	his	,	'	either	,	because	that	sexualizes	god	.	``	but	i	did	n't	want	to	argue	semantics	with	these	boys	,	so	after	a	very	long	,	uncomfortable	pause	,	i	said	``	yes	,	yes	,	i	do	.	i	feel	very	loved	.	``
and	they	looked	at	each	other	and	smiled	,	like	that	was	the	right	answer	.	and	then	they	said	,	``	do	you	believe	that	we	're	all	brothers	and	sisters	on	this	planet	?	``
and	i	said	,	``	yes	,	i	do	.	yes	,	i	do	.	``	and	i	was	so	relieved	that	it	was	a	question	i	could	answer	so	quickly	.
and	they	said	,	``	well	,	then	we	have	a	story	to	tell	you	.	``
and	they	told	me	this	story	all	about	this	guy	named	lehi	,	who	lived	in	jerusalem	in	600	bc	.
now	,	apparently	in	jerusalem	in	600	bc	,	everyone	was	completely	bad	and	evil	.	every	single	one	of	them	:	man	,	woman	,	child	,	infant	,	fetus	.
and	god	came	to	lehi	and	said	to	him	,	``	put	your	family	on	a	boat	and	i	will	lead	you	out	of	here	.	``	and	god	did	lead	them	.
he	led	them	to	america	.
i	said	,	``	america	?	from	jerusalem	to	america	by	boat	in	600	bc	?	``
and	they	said	,	``	yes	.	``
then	they	told	me	how	lehi	and	his	descendants	reproduced	and	reproduced	,	and	over	the	course	of	600	years	there	were	two	great	races	of	them	,	the	nephites	and	the	lamanites	,	and	the	nephites	were	totally	,	totally	good	--	each	and	every	one	of	them	--	and	the	lamanites	were	totally	bad	and	evil	--
every	single	one	of	them	just	bad	to	the	bone	.
then	,	after	jesus	died	on	the	cross	for	our	sins	,	on	his	way	up	to	heaven	he	stopped	by	america	and	visited	the	nephites	.
and	he	told	them	that	if	they	all	remained	totally	,	totally	good	--	each	and	every	one	of	them	--	they	would	win	the	war	against	the	evil	lamanites	.
but	apparently	somebody	blew	it	,	because	the	lamanites	were	able	to	kill	all	the	nephites	.
all	but	one	guy	,	this	guy	named	mormon	,	who	managed	to	survive	by	hiding	in	the	woods	.
and	he	made	sure	this	whole	story	was	written	down	in	reformed	egyptian	hieroglyphics	chiseled	onto	gold	plates	,	which	he	then	buried	near	palmyra	,	new	york	.
i	said	,	``	what	happened	to	the	lamanites	?	``
and	they	said	,	``	well	,	they	became	our	native	americans	here	in	the	u.s.	``	and	i	said	,	``	so	,	you	believe	the	native	americans	are	descended	from	a	people	who	were	totally	evil	?	``	and	they	said	,	``	yes	.	``
then	they	told	me	how	this	guy	named	joseph	smith	found	those	buried	gold	plates	right	in	his	backyard	,	and	he	also	found	this	magic	stone	back	there	that	he	put	into	his	hat	to	translate	the	gold	plates	from	the	reformed	egyptian	into	english	.
well	,	at	this	point	i	just	wanted	to	give	these	two	boys	some	advice	about	their	pitch	.
i	wanted	to	say	,	``	ok	,	do	n't	start	with	this	story	.	``	i	mean	,	even	the	scientologists	know	to	start	with	a	personality	test	before	they	start	--	--	telling	people	all	about	xenu	,	the	evil	intergalactic	overlord	.
well	,	then	they	said	,	``	do	you	believe	that	god	speaks	to	us	through	his	righteous	prophets	?	``	and	i	said	,	``	no	,	i	do	n't	.	``
because	i	was	,	sort	of	,	upset	about	this	lamanite	story	and	this	crazy	gold	plate	story	,	but	the	truth	was	,	i	had	n't	really	thought	this	through	,	so	i	backpedaled	a	little	and	i	said	,	``	well	,	what	exactly	do	you	mean	by	righteous	?
and	what	do	you	mean	by	prophets	?	like	,	could	the	prophets	be	women	?	``
and	they	said	,	``	no.	``	and	i	said	,	``	why	?	``	and	they	said	,	``	well	,	it	's	because	god	gave	women	a	gift	that	is	so	spectacular	,	it	is	so	wonderful	,	that	the	only	gift	he	had	left	over	to	give	men	was	the	gift	of	prophecy	.	``
what	is	this	wonderful	gift	god	gave	women	,	i	wondered	?
maybe	their	greater	ability	to	cooperate	and	adapt	?
women	's	longer	lifespan	?	the	fact	that	women	tend	to	be	much	less	violent	than	men	?	but	,	no	,	it	was	n't	any	of	these	gifts	.
they	said	,	``	well	,	it	's	her	ability	to	bear	children	.	``
i	said	,	``	oh	,	come	on	.	i	mean	,	even	if	women	tried	to	have	a	baby	every	single	year	from	the	time	they	were	15	to	the	time	they	were	45	,	assuming	they	did	n't	die	from	exhaustion	,	it	still	seems	like	some	women	would	have	some	time	left	over	to	hear	the	word	of	god	.	``	and	they	said	,	``	no.	``
well	,	then	they	did	n't	look	so	fresh	-	faced	and	cute	to	me	any	more	,	but	they	had	more	to	say	.
they	said	,	``	well	,	we	also	believe	that	if	you	're	a	mormon	and	if	you	're	in	good	standing	with	the	church	,	when	you	die	you	get	to	go	to	heaven	and	be	with	your	family	for	all	eternity	.	``	and	i	said	,	``	oh	,	dear	--	--	that	would	n't	be	such	a	good	incentive	for	me	.	``
and	they	said	,	``	oh	--	hey	,	well	,	we	also	believe	that	when	you	go	to	heaven	you	get	your	body	restored	to	you	in	its	best	original	state	.
like	,	if	you	'd	lost	a	leg	,	well	,	you	get	it	back	.
or	,	if	you	'd	gone	blind	,	you	could	see	.	``
i	said	,	``	oh	--	now	,	i	do	n't	have	a	uterus	because	i	had	cancer	a	few	years	ago	.	so	,	does	this	mean	that	if	i	went	to	heaven	i	would	get	my	old	uterus	back	?	``	and	they	said	,	``	sure	.	``	and	i	said	,	``	i	do	n't	want	it	back	.	i	'm	happy	without	it	.	``	gosh	.
what	if	you	had	a	nose	job	and	you	liked	it	?
would	god	force	you	to	get	your	old	nose	back	?
well	,	then	they	gave	me	this	book	of	mormon	,	and	they	told	me	to	read	this	chapter	and	that	chapter	,	and	they	said	they	'd	come	back	some	day	and	check	in	on	me	,
and	i	think	i	said	something	like	,	``	please	do	n't	hurry	,	``	or	maybe	it	was	just	,	``	please	do	n't	,	``	and	they	were	gone	.
ok	,	so	,	i	initially	felt	really	superior	to	these	boys	,	and	smug	in	my	more	conventional	faith	.	but	then	,	the	more	i	thought	about	it	,	the	more	i	had	to	be	honest	with	myself	.
if	someone	came	to	my	door	and	i	was	hearing	catholic	theology	and	dogma	for	the	very	first	time	,	and	they	said	,	``	we	believe	that	god	impregnated	a	very	young	girl	without	the	use	of	intercourse	,	and	the	fact	that	she	was	a	virgin	is	maniacally	important	to	us	--	--	and	she	had	a	baby	,	and	that	's	the	son	of	god	,	``	i	mean	,	i	would	think	that	's	equally	ridiculous	.
i	'm	just	so	used	to	that	story	.
so	,	i	could	n't	let	myself	feel	condescending	towards	these	boys	.
but	the	question	they	asked	me	when	they	first	arrived	really	stuck	in	my	head	:	did	i	believe	that	god	loved	me	with	all	his	heart	?
because	i	was	n't	exactly	sure	how	i	felt	about	that	question	.	now	,	if	they	'd	asked	me	,	do	you	feel	that	god	loves	you	with	all	his	heart	?
well	,	that	would	have	been	much	different	,	i	think	i	would	have	instantly	answered	,	``	yes	,	yes	,	i	feel	it	all	the	time	.	i	feel	god	's	love	when	i	'm	hurt	and	confused	,	and	i	feel	consoled	and	cared	for	.	i	take	shelter	in	god	's	love	when	i	do	n't	understand	why	tragedy	hits	,	and	i	feel	god	's	love	when	i	look	with	gratitude	at	all	the	beauty	i	see	.	``	but	since	they	asked	me	that	question	with	the	word	believe	in	it	,	somehow	it	was	all	different	,	because	i	was	n't	exactly	sure	if	i	believed	what	i	so	clearly	felt	.
