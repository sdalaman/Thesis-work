so	i	am	a	surgeon	who	studies	creativity	,	and	i	have	never	had	a	patient	tell	me	that	``	i	really	want	you	to	be	creative	during	surgery	,	``
and	so	i	guess	there	's	a	little	bit	of	irony	to	it	.
i	will	say	though	that	,	after	having	done	surgery	a	lot	,	it	's	somewhat	similar	to	playing	a	musical	instrument	.
and	for	me	,	this	sort	of	deep	and	enduring	fascination	with	sound	is	what	led	me	to	both	be	a	surgeon	and	also	to	study	the	science	of	sound	,	particularly	music	.
and	so	i	'm	going	to	try	to	talk	to	you	over	the	next	few	minutes	about	my	career	in	terms	of	how	i	'm	able	to	actually	try	to	study	music	and	really	try	to	grapple	with	all	these	questions	of	how	the	brain	is	able	to	be	creative	.
i	've	done	most	of	this	work	at	johns	hopkins	university	,
but	also	at	the	national	institute	of	health	where	i	was	previously	.
i	'm	going	to	go	over	some	science	experiments	and	try	to	cover	three	musical	experiments	.
i	'm	going	to	start	off	by	playing	a	video	for	you	.
and	this	video	is	a	video	of	keith	jarrett	,	who	's	a	well	-	known	jazz	improviser	and	probably	the	most	well	-	known	,	iconic	example	of	someone	who	takes	improvisation	to	a	really	higher	level	.
and	he	'll	improvise	entire	concerts	off	the	top	of	his	head	,	and	he	'll	never	play	it	exactly	the	same	way	again	,
and	so	,	as	a	form	of	intense	creativity	,	i	think	this	is	a	great	example	.
and	so	why	do	n't	we	go	and	click	the	video	.
it	's	really	a	remarkable	,	awesome	thing	that	happens	there	.
i	've	always	--	just	as	a	listener	,	as	just	a	fan	--	i	listen	to	that	,	and	i	'm	just	astounded	.
i	think	--	how	can	this	possibly	be	?
how	can	the	brain	generate	that	much	information	,	that	much	music	,	spontaneously	?
and	so	i	set	out	with	this	concept	,	scientifically	,	that	artistic	creativity	,	it	's	magical	,	but	it	's	not	magic	,
meaning	that	it	's	a	product	of	the	brain	.
there	's	not	too	many	brain	-	dead	people	creating	art	.
and	so	with	this	notion	that	artistic	creativity	is	in	fact	a	neurologic	product	,	i	took	this	thesis	that	we	could	study	it	just	like	we	study	any	other	complex	neurologic	process	.
and	i	think	there	's	some	sub	-	questions	there	that	i	put	there	.
is	it	truly	possible	to	study	creativity	scientifically	?
and	i	think	that	's	a	good	question	.
and	i	'll	tell	you	that	most	scientific	studies	of	music	,	they	're	very	dense	,
and	when	you	actually	go	through	them	,	it	's	very	hard	to	recognize	the	music	in	it	.
in	fact	,	they	seem	to	be	very	unmusical	entirely	and	to	miss	the	whole	point	of	the	music	.
and	so	it	brings	the	second	question	:	why	should	scientists	study	creativity	?
maybe	we	're	not	the	right	people	to	do	it	.
well	it	may	be	,	but	i	will	say	that	,	from	a	scientific	perspective	--	we	talked	a	lot	about	innovation	today	--	the	science	of	innovation	,	how	much	we	understand	about	how	the	brain	is	able	to	innovate	is	in	its	infancy	,
and	truly	,	we	know	very	little	about	how	we	are	able	to	be	creative	.
and	so	i	think	that	we	're	going	to	see	over	the	next	10	,	20	,	30	years	a	real	science	of	creativity	that	's	burgeoning	and	is	going	to	flourish	.
because	we	now	have	new	methods	that	can	enable	us	to	take	this	process	of	something	like	this	,	complex	jazz	improvisation	,	and	study	it	rigorously	.
and	so	it	gets	down	to	the	brain	.
and	so	all	of	us	have	this	remarkable	brain	,	which	is	poorly	understood	to	say	the	least	.
i	think	that	neuroscientists	have	many	more	questions	than	answers	,
and	i	myself	,	i	'm	not	going	to	give	you	many	answers	today	,	just	ask	a	lot	of	questions	.
and	fundamentally	that	's	what	i	do	in	my	lab	.
i	ask	questions	about	what	is	this	brain	doing	to	enable	us	to	do	this	.
this	is	the	main	method	that	i	use	.	this	is	called	functional	mri	.	if	you	've	been	in	an	mri	scanner	,	it	's	very	much	the	same	,	but	this	one	is	outfitted	in	a	special	way	to	not	just	take	pictures	of	your	brain	,	but	to	also	take	pictures	of	active	areas	of	the	brain	.
now	the	way	that	's	done	is	by	the	following	.
there	's	something	called	bold	imaging	,	which	is	blood	oxygen	level	dependent	imaging	.
now	when	you	're	in	an	fmri	scanner	,	you	're	in	a	big	magnet	that	's	aligning	your	molecules	in	certain	areas	.
when	an	area	of	the	brain	is	active	,	meaning	a	neural	area	is	active	,	it	gets	blood	flow	shunted	to	that	area	.
that	blood	flow	causes	an	increase	in	local	blood	to	that	area	with	a	deoxyhemoglobin	change	in	concentration	.
deoxyhemoglobin	can	be	detected	by	mri	,	whereas	oxyhemoglobin	ca	n't	.
so	through	this	method	of	inference	--	and	we	're	measuring	blood	flow	,	not	neural	activity	--	we	say	that	an	area	of	the	brain	that	's	getting	more	blood	was	active	during	a	particular	task	,
and	that	's	the	crux	of	how	fmri	works	.
and	it	's	been	used	since	the	'90s	to	study	really	complex	processes	.
now	i	'm	going	to	review	a	study	that	i	did	,	which	was	jazz	in	an	fmri	scanner	.	and	this	was	done	with	a	colleague	of	mine	,	alan	braun	,	at	the	nih	.
this	is	a	short	video	of	how	we	did	this	project	.	charles	limb	:	this	is	a	plastic	midi	piano	keyboard	that	we	use	for	the	jazz	experiments	.
and	it	's	a	35	-	key	keyboard	that	is	designed	to	fit	both	inside	the	scanner	,	be	magnetically	safe	,	have	minimal	interference	that	would	contribute	to	any	artifact	and	have	this	cushion	so	that	it	can	rest	on	the	players	'	legs	while	they	're	lying	down	in	the	scanner	,	playing	on	their	back	.
and	it	works	like	this	--	this	does	n't	actually	produce	any	sound	.
it	sends	out	what	's	called	a	midi	signal	--	or	a	musical	instrument	digital	interface	--	through	these	wires	into	the	box	and	then	the	computer	,	which	then	trigger	high	-	quality	piano	samples	like	this	.
cl	:	okay	,	so	it	works	.
and	so	through	this	piano	keyboard	,	we	now	have	the	means	to	take	a	musical	process	and	study	it	.
so	what	do	you	do	now	that	you	have	this	cool	piano	keyboard	?
you	ca	n't	just	sort	of	--	``	it	's	great	we	've	got	this	keyboard	.	``
we	actually	have	to	come	up	with	a	scientific	experiment	.
and	so	the	experiment	really	rests	on	the	following	:
what	happens	in	the	brain	during	something	that	's	memorized	and	over	-	learned	,	and	what	happens	in	the	brain	during	something	that	is	spontaneously	generated	,	or	improvised	,	in	a	way	that	's	matched	motorically	and	in	terms	of	lower	-	level	sensory	motor	features	?
and	so	,	i	have	here	what	we	call	the	``	paradigms	.	``
there	's	a	scale	paradigm	,	which	is	just	playing	a	scale	up	and	down	,	memorized	.
and	then	there	's	improvising	on	a	scale	--	quarter	notes	,	metronome	,	right	hand	--	scientifically	very	safe	,	but	musically	really	boring	.
and	then	there	's	the	bottom	one	,	which	is	called	the	jazz	paradigm	.
and	so	what	we	did	was	we	brought	professional	jazz	players	to	the	nih	,	and	we	had	them	memorize	this	piece	of	music	on	the	left	,	the	lower	-	left	--	which	is	what	you	heard	me	playing	--	and	then	we	had	them	improvise	to	the	same	exact	chord	changes	.
and	if	you	can	hit	that	lower	-	right	sound	icon	,	that	's	an	example	of	what	was	recorded	in	the	scanner	.
so	in	the	end	,	it	's	not	the	most	natural	environment	,	but	they	're	able	to	play	real	music	.
and	i	've	listened	to	that	solo	200	times	,	and	i	still	like	it	.
and	the	musicians	,	they	were	comfortable	in	the	end	.
and	so	we	first	measured	the	number	of	notes	.
were	they	in	fact	just	playing	a	lot	more	notes	when	they	were	improvising	?
that	was	not	what	was	going	on	.
and	then	we	looked	at	the	brain	activity	.
i	'm	going	to	try	to	condense	this	for	you	.
these	are	contrast	maps	that	are	showing	subtractions	between	what	changes	when	you	're	improvising	versus	when	you	're	doing	something	memorized	.
in	red	is	an	area	that	active	in	the	prefrontal	cortex	,	the	frontal	lobe	of	the	brain	,
and	in	blue	is	this	area	that	was	deactivated	.
and	so	we	had	this	focal	area	called	the	medial	prefrontal	cortex	that	went	way	up	in	activity	.
we	had	this	broad	patch	of	area	called	the	lateral	prefrontal	cortex	that	went	way	down	in	activity	,	and	i	'll	summarize	that	for	you	here	.
now	these	are	multifunctional	areas	of	the	brain	.
as	i	like	to	say	,	these	are	not	the	``	jazz	areas	``	of	the	brain	.
they	do	a	whole	host	of	things	that	have	to	do	with	self	-	reflection	,	introspection	,	working	memory	and	so	forth	.
really	,	consciousness	is	seated	in	the	frontal	lobe	.
but	we	have	this	combination	of	an	area	that	's	thought	to	be	involved	in	self	-	monitoring	,	turning	off	,	and	this	area	that	's	thought	to	be	autobiographical	,	or	self	-	expressive	,	turning	on	.
and	we	think	,	at	least	in	this	preliminary	--	it	's	one	study	;	it	's	probably	wrong	,
but	it	's	one	study	--
we	think	that	at	least	a	reasonable	hypothesis	is	that	,	to	be	creative	,	you	have	to	have	this	weird	dissociation	in	your	frontal	lobe	.
one	area	turns	on	,	and	a	big	area	shuts	off	,	so	that	you	're	not	inhibited	,	so	that	you	're	willing	to	make	mistakes	,	so	that	you	're	not	constantly	shutting	down	all	of	these	new	generative	impulses	.
now	a	lot	of	people	know	that	music	is	not	always	a	solo	activity	--	sometimes	it	's	done	communicatively	.
and	so	the	next	question	was	:	what	happens	when	musicians	are	trading	back	and	forth	,	something	called	``	trading	fours	,	``	which	is	something	they	do	normally	in	a	jazz	experiment	?
so	this	is	a	twelve	-	bar	blues	.
and	i	've	broken	it	down	into	four	-	bar	groups	here	,	so	you	would	know	how	you	would	trade	.
now	what	we	did	was	we	brought	a	musician	into	the	scanner	--	same	way	--	had	them	memorize	this	melody	and	then	had	another	musician	out	in	the	control	room	trading	back	and	forth	interactively	.
so	this	is	a	musician	,	mike	pope	,	one	of	the	world	's	best	bassists	and	a	fantastic	piano	player	.
so	he	's	now	playing	the	piece	that	we	just	saw	just	a	little	better	than	i	wrote	it	.
cl	:	mike	,	come	on	in	.	mike	pope	:	may	the	force	be	with	you	.
nurse	:	nothing	's	in	your	pockets	,	right	mike	?
mp	:	nope	.	nothing	's	in	my	pockets	.	nurse	:	okay	.
cl	:	you	have	to	have	the	right	attitude	to	agree	to	it	.
it	's	kind	of	fun	actually	.
and	so	now	we	're	playing	back	and	forth	.
he	's	in	there	.	you	can	see	his	legs	up	there	.
and	then	i	'm	in	the	control	room	here	,	playing	back	and	forth	.
mike	pope	:	this	is	a	pretty	good	representation	of	what	it	's	like	.
and	it	's	good	that	it	's	not	too	quick	.
the	fact	that	we	do	it	over	and	over	again	lets	you	acclimate	to	your	surroundings	.
so	the	hardest	thing	for	me	was	the	kinesthetic	thing	,	of	looking	at	my	hands	through	two	mirrors	,	laying	on	my	back	and	not	able	to	move	at	all	except	for	my	hand	.
that	was	challenging	.
but	again	,	there	were	moments	,	for	sure	,	there	were	moments	of	real	,	honest	-	to	-	god	musical	interplay	,	for	sure	.
cl	:	at	this	point	,	i	'll	take	a	few	moments	.
and	so	what	you	're	seeing	here	--	and	i	'm	doing	a	cardinal	sin	in	science	,	which	is	to	show	you	preliminary	data	.
this	is	one	subject	's	data	.
this	is	,	in	fact	,	mike	pope	's	data	.
so	what	am	i	showing	you	here	?
when	he	was	trading	fours	with	me	,	improvising	versus	memorized	,	his	language	areas	lit	up	,	his	broca	's	area	,	which	is	inferior	frontal	gyrus	on	the	left	.
he	actually	had	it	also	homologous	on	the	right	.
this	is	an	area	thought	to	be	involved	in	expressive	communication	.
this	whole	notion	that	music	is	a	language	--	well	maybe	there	's	a	neurologic	basis	to	it	in	fact	after	all	,	and	we	can	see	it	when	two	musicians	are	having	a	musical	conversation	.
and	so	we	've	done	this	actually	on	eight	subjects	now	,	and	we	're	just	getting	all	the	data	together	,
so	hopefully	we	'll	have	something	to	say	about	it	meaningfully	.
now	when	i	think	about	improvisation	and	the	language	,	well	what	's	next	?
rap	,	of	course	,	rap	--	free	-	style	.
and	so	i	've	always	been	fascinated	by	free	-	style	.
and	let	's	go	ahead	and	play	this	video	here	.
mos	def	:	♫	...	brown	skin	i	be	,	standing	five	-	ten	i	be	♫	♫	rockin	'	it	when	i	be	,	in	your	vicinity	♫	♫	whole	-	style	synergy	,	recognize	symmetry	♫	♫	go	and	try	to	injure	me	,	broke	'	em	down	chemically	♫	♫	ai	n't	the	number	10	mc	,	talk	about	how	been	i	be	♫	♫	styled	it	like	kennedy	,	late	like	a	10	to	three	♫	♫	when	i	say	when	i	be	,	girls	say	bend	that	key	cut	♫	cl	:	and	so	there	's	a	lot	of	analogy	between	what	takes	place	in	free	-	style	rap	and	jazz	.
there	are	,	in	fact	,	a	lot	of	correlations	between	the	two	forms	of	music	i	think	in	different	time	periods	.
in	a	lot	a	ways	,	rap	serves	the	same	social	function	that	jazz	used	to	serve	.
so	how	do	you	study	rap	scientifically	?
and	my	colleagues	kind	of	think	i	'm	crazy	,	but	i	think	it	's	very	viable	.
and	so	this	is	what	you	do	:	you	have	a	free	-	style	artist	come	in	and	memorize	a	rap	that	you	write	for	them	,	that	they	've	never	heard	before	,	and	then	you	have	them	free	-	style	.
so	i	told	my	lab	members	that	i	would	rap	for	ted	,
and	they	said	,	``	no	,	you	wo	n't	.	``
and	then	i	thought	--	but	here	's	the	thing	.
with	this	big	screen	,	you	can	all	rap	with	me	.	okay	?
so	what	we	had	them	do	was	memorize	this	lower	-	left	sound	icon	,	please	.
this	is	the	control	condition	.	this	is	what	they	memorized	.
computer	:	♫	memory	,	thump	.	♫	cl	:	♫	thump	of	the	beat	in	a	known	repeat	♫	♫	rhythm	and	rhyme	,	they	make	me	complete	♫	♫	the	climb	is	sublime	when	i	'm	on	the	mic	♫	♫	spittin	'	rhymes	that	hit	you	like	a	lightning	strike	♫	♫	i	search	for	the	truth	in	this	eternal	quest	♫	♫	my	passion	's	not	fashion	,	you	can	see	how	i	'm	dressed	♫	♫	psychopathic	words	in	my	head	appear	♫	♫	whisper	these	lyrics	only	i	can	hear	♫	♫	the	art	of	discovering	and	that	which	is	hovering	♫	♫	inside	the	mind	of	those	unconfined	♫	♫	all	of	these	words	keep	pouring	out	like	rain	♫	♫	i	need	a	mad	scientist	to	check	my	brain	♫	i	guarantee	you	that	will	never	happen	again	.
so	now	,	what	's	great	about	these	free	-	stylers	,	they	will	get	cued	different	words	.
they	do	n't	know	what	's	coming	,	but	they	'll	hear	something	off	the	cuff	.
go	ahead	and	hit	that	right	sound	icon	.
they	are	going	to	be	cued	these	three	square	words	:	``	like	,	``	``	not	``	and	``	head	.	``
he	does	n't	know	what	's	coming	.
free	-	styler	:	♫	i	'm	like	some	kind	of	[	unclear	]	♫	♫	[	unclear	]	extraterrestrial	,	celestial	scene	♫	♫	back	in	the	days	,	i	used	to	sit	in	pyramids	and	meditate	♫	♫	with	two	microphones	hovering	over	my	head	♫	♫	see	if	i	could	still	listen	,	spittin	'	off	the	sound	♫	♫	see	what	you	grinning	♫	♫	i	teach	the	children	in	the	back	of	the	classroom	♫	♫	about	the	message	of	apocalyptical	♫	♫	not	really	though	,	'	cause	i	've	got	to	keep	it	simple	♫	♫	[	unclear	]	instrumental	♫	♫	detrimental	playing	super	mario	♫	♫	[	unclear	]	boxes	[	unclear	]	hip	hop	♫	cl	:	so	again	,	it	's	an	incredible	thing	that	's	taking	place	.
it	's	doing	something	that	,	neurologically	,	is	remarkable	.
whether	or	not	you	like	the	music	is	irrelevant	.
creatively	speaking	,	it	's	just	a	phenomenal	thing	.
this	is	a	short	video	of	how	we	actually	do	this	in	a	scanner	.
cl	:	we	're	here	with	emmanuel	.
cl	:	that	was	recorded	in	the	scanner	,	by	the	way	.	cl	:	that	's	emmanuel	in	the	scanner	.
he	's	just	memorized	a	rhyme	for	us	.
emmanuel	:	♫	top	of	the	beat	with	no	repeat	♫	♫	rhythm	and	rhyme	make	me	complete	♫	♫	climb	is	sublime	when	i	'm	on	the	mic	♫	♫	spittin	'	rhymes	that	'll	hit	you	like	a	lightning	strike	♫	♫	i	search	for	the	truth	in	this	eternal	quest	♫	♫	i	'm	passing	on	fashion	;	you	can	see	how	i	'm	dressed	♫	cl	:	okay	.	so	i	'm	going	to	stop	that	there	.	so	what	do	we	see	in	his	brain	?
well	,	this	is	actually	four	rappers	'	brains	.
and	what	we	see	,	we	do	see	language	areas	lighting	up	,	but	then	--	eyes	closed	--	when	you	are	free	-	styling	versus	memorizing	,	you	've	got	major	visual	areas	lighting	up	.
you	've	got	major	cerebellar	activity	,	which	is	involved	in	motor	coordination	.
you	have	heightened	brain	activity	when	you	're	doing	a	comparable	task	,	when	that	one	task	is	creative	and	the	other	task	is	memorized	.
it	's	very	preliminary	,	but	i	think	it	's	kind	of	cool	.
so	just	to	conclude	,	we	've	got	a	lot	of	questions	to	ask	,
and	like	i	said	,	we	'll	ask	questions	here	,	not	answer	them	.
but	we	want	to	get	at	the	root	of	what	is	creative	genius	,	neurologically	,
and	i	think	,	with	these	methods	,	we	're	getting	close	to	being	there	.
and	i	think	hopefully	in	the	next	10	,	20	years	you	'll	actually	see	real	,	meaningful	studies	that	say	science	has	to	catch	up	to	art	,	and	maybe	we	're	starting	now	to	get	there	.
and	so	i	want	to	thank	you	for	your	time	.	i	appreciate	it	.
