my	journey	to	become	a	polar	specialist	,	photographing	,	specializing	in	the	polar	regions	,	began	when	i	was	four	years	old	,	when	my	family	moved	from	southern	canada	to	northern	baffin	island	,	up	by	greenland	.
there	we	lived	with	the	inuit
in	the	tiny	inuit	community	of	200	inuit	people	,	where	[	we	]	were	one	of	three	non	-	inuit	families	.
and	in	this	community	,	we	did	n't	have	a	television	;	we	did	n't	have	computers	,	obviously	,	radio	.
we	did	n't	even	have	a	telephone	.
all	of	my	time	was	spent	outside	with	the	inuit	,	playing	.
the	snow	and	the	ice	were	my	sandbox	,	and	the	inuit	were	my	teachers	.
and	that	's	where	i	became	truly	obsessed	with	this	polar	realm	.
and	i	knew	someday	that	i	was	going	to	do	something	that	had	to	do	with	trying	to	share	news	about	it	and	protect	it	.
i	'd	like	to	share	with	you	,	for	just	two	minutes	only	,	some	images	,	a	cross	-	section	of	my	work	,	to	the	beautiful	music	by	brandi	carlile	,	``	have	you	ever	.	``
i	do	n't	know	why	national	geographic	has	done	this	,	they	've	never	done	this	before	,	but	they	're	allowing	me	to	show	you	a	few	images	from	a	coverage	that	i	've	just	completed	that	is	not	published	yet	.
national	geographic	does	n't	do	this	,
so	i	'm	very	excited	to	be	able	to	share	this	with	you	.
and	what	these	images	are	--	you	'll	see	them	at	the	start	of	the	slide	show	--	there	's	only	about	four	images	--	but	it	's	of	a	little	bear	that	lives	in	the	great	bear	rainforest	.
it	's	pure	white	,	but	it	's	not	a	polar	bear	.
it	's	a	spirit	bear	,	or	a	kermode	bear	.
there	are	only	200	of	these	bears	left	.
they	're	more	rare	than	the	panda	bear	.
i	sat	there	on	the	river	for	two	months	without	seeing	one	.
i	thought	,	my	career	's	over	.
i	proposed	this	stupid	story	to	national	geographic	.
what	in	the	heck	was	i	thinking	?
so	i	had	two	months	to	sit	there	and	figure	out	different	ways	of	what	i	was	going	to	do	in	my	next	life	,	after	i	was	a	photographer	,	because	they	were	going	to	fire	me	.
because	national	geographic	is	a	magazine	;	they	remind	us	all	the	time	:	they	publish	pictures	,	not	excuses	.
and	after	two	months	of	sitting	there	--	one	day	,	thinking	that	it	was	all	over	,	this	incredible	big	white	male	came	down	,	right	beside	me	,	three	feet	away	from	me	,	and	he	went	down	and	grabbed	a	fish	and	went	off	in	the	forest	and	ate	it	.
and	then	i	spent	the	entire	day	living	my	childhood	dream	of	walking	around	with	this	bear	through	the	forest	.
he	went	through	this	old	-	growth	forest	and	sat	up	beside	this	400	-	year	-	old	culturally	modified	tree	and	went	to	sleep	.
and	i	actually	got	to	sleep	within	three	feet	of	him	,	just	in	the	forest	,	and	photograph	him	.
so	i	'm	very	excited	to	be	able	to	show	you	those	images	and	a	cross	-	section	of	my	work	that	i	've	done	on	the	polar	regions	.
please	enjoy	.

thank	you	very	much	.	i	appreciate	it	.
we	're	inundated	with	news	all	the	time	that	the	sea	ice	is	disappearing	and	it	's	at	its	lowest	level	.
and	in	fact	,	scientists	were	originally	saying	sea	ice	is	going	to	disappear	in	the	next	hundred	years	,	then	they	said	50	years	.
now	they	're	saying	the	sea	ice	in	the	arctic	,	the	summertime	extent	is	going	to	be	gone	in	the	next	four	to	10	years	.
and	what	does	that	mean	?
after	a	while	of	reading	this	in	the	news	,	it	just	becomes	news	.
you	glaze	over	with	it	.
and	what	i	'm	trying	to	do	with	my	work	is	put	faces	to	this	.
and	i	want	people	to	understand	and	get	the	concept	that	,	if	we	lose	ice	,	we	stand	to	lose	an	entire	ecosystem	.
projections	are	that	we	could	lose	polar	bears	;	they	could	become	extinct	in	the	next	50	to	100	years	.
and	there	's	no	better	,	sexier	,	more	beautiful	,	charismatic	megafauna	species	for	me	to	hang	my	campaign	on	.
polar	bears	are	amazing	hunters	.
this	was	a	bear	i	sat	with	for	a	while	on	the	shores	.
there	was	no	ice	around	.
but	this	glacier	caved	into	the	water	and	a	seal	got	on	it	.
and	this	bear	swam	out	to	that	seal	--	800	lb	.	bearded	seal	--	grabbed	it	,	swam	back	and	ate	it	.
and	he	was	so	full	,	he	was	so	happy	and	so	fat	eating	this	seal	,	that	,	as	i	approached	him	--	about	20	feet	away	--	to	get	this	picture	,	his	only	defense	was	to	keep	eating	more	seal	.
and	as	he	ate	,	he	was	so	full	--	he	probably	had	about	200	lbs	of	meat	in	his	belly	--	and	as	he	ate	inside	one	side	of	his	mouth	,	he	was	regurgitating	out	the	other	side	of	his	mouth	.	so	as	long	as	these	bears	have	any	bit	of	ice	they	will	survive	,	but	it	's	the	ice	that	's	disappearing	.
we	're	finding	more	and	more	dead	bears	in	the	arctic	.
when	i	worked	on	polar	bears	as	a	biologist	20	years	ago	,	we	never	found	dead	bears	.
and	in	the	last	four	or	five	years	,	we	're	finding	dead	bears	popping	up	all	over	the	place	.
we	're	seeing	them	in	the	beaufort	sea	,	floating	in	the	open	ocean	where	the	ice	has	melted	out	.
i	found	a	couple	in	norway	last	year	.	we	're	seeing	them	on	the	ice	.
these	bears	are	already	showing	signs	of	the	stress	of	disappearing	ice	.
here	's	a	mother	and	her	two	year	-	old	cub	were	traveling	on	a	ship	a	hundred	miles	offshore	in	the	middle	of	nowhere	,	and	they	're	riding	on	this	big	piece	of	glacier	ice	,	which	is	great	for	them	;	they	're	safe	at	this	point	.
they	're	not	going	to	die	of	hypothermia	.
they	're	going	to	get	to	land	.
but	unfortunately	,	95	percent	of	the	glaciers	in	the	arctic	are	also	receding	right	now	to	the	point	that	the	ice	is	ending	up	on	land	and	not	injecting	any	ice	back	into	the	ecosystem	.
these	ringed	seals	,	these	are	the	``	fatsicles	``	of	the	arctic	.
these	little	,	fat	dumplings	,	150	-	pound	bundles	of	blubber	are	the	mainstay	of	the	polar	bear	.
and	they	're	not	like	the	harbor	seals	that	you	have	here	.
these	ringed	seals	also	live	out	their	entire	life	cycle	associated	and	connected	to	sea	ice	.
they	give	birth	inside	the	ice	,	and	they	feed	on	the	arctic	cod	that	live	under	the	ice	.
and	here	's	a	picture	of	sick	ice	.
this	is	a	piece	of	multi	-	year	ice	that	's	12	years	old	.
and	what	scientists	did	n't	predict	is	that	,	as	this	ice	melts	,	these	big	pockets	of	black	water	are	forming	and	they	're	grabbing	the	sun	's	energy	and	accelerating	the	melting	process	.
and	here	we	are	diving	in	the	beaufort	sea	.
the	visibility	's	600	ft.	;	we	're	on	our	safety	lines	;	the	ice	is	moving	all	over	the	place	.
i	wish	i	could	spend	half	an	hour	telling	you	about	how	we	almost	died	on	this	dive	.
but	what	's	important	in	this	picture	is	that	you	have	a	piece	of	multi	-	year	ice	,	that	big	chunk	of	ice	up	in	the	corner	.
in	that	one	single	piece	of	ice	,	you	have	300	species	of	microorganisms	.
and	in	the	spring	,	when	the	sun	returns	to	the	ice	,	it	forms	the	phytoplankton	,	grows	under	that	ice	,	and	then	you	get	bigger	sheets	of	seaweed	,	and	then	you	get	the	zoo	plankton	feeding	on	all	that	life	.
so	really	what	the	ice	does	is	it	acts	like	a	garden	.
it	acts	like	the	soil	in	a	garden	.	it	's	an	inverted	garden	.
losing	that	ice	is	like	losing	the	soil	in	a	garden	.
here	's	me	in	my	office	.
i	hope	you	appreciate	yours	.
this	is	after	an	hour	under	the	ice	.
i	ca	n't	feel	my	lips	;	my	face	is	frozen	;	i	ca	n't	feel	my	hands	;	i	ca	n't	feel	my	feet	.
and	i	've	come	up	,	and	all	i	wanted	to	do	was	get	out	of	the	water	.
after	an	hour	in	these	conditions	,	it	's	so	extreme	that	,	when	i	go	down	,	almost	every	dive	i	vomit	into	my	regulator	because	my	body	ca	n't	deal	with	the	stress	of	the	cold	on	my	head	.
and	so	i	'm	just	so	happy	that	the	dive	is	over	.
i	get	to	hand	my	camera	to	my	assistant	,	and	i	'm	looking	up	at	him	,	and	i	'm	going	,	``	woo	.	woo	.	woo	.	``	which	means	,	``	take	my	camera	.	``	and	he	thinks	i	'm	saying	,	``	take	my	picture	.	``	so	we	had	this	little	communication	breakdown	.
but	it	's	worth	it	.
i	'm	going	to	show	you	pictures	of	beluga	whales	,	bowhead	whales	,	and	narwhals	,	and	polar	bears	,	and	leopard	seals	today	,	but	this	picture	right	here	means	more	to	me	than	any	other	i	've	ever	made	.
i	dropped	down	in	this	ice	hole	,	just	through	that	hole	that	you	just	saw	,	and	i	looked	up	under	the	underside	of	the	ice	,	and	i	was	dizzy	;	i	thought	i	had	vertigo	.
i	got	very	nervous	--	no	rope	,	no	safety	line	,	the	whole	world	is	moving	around	me	--	and	i	thought	,	``	i	'm	in	trouble	.	``	but	what	happened	is	that	the	entire	underside	was	full	of	these	billions	of	amphipods	and	copepods	moving	around	and	feeding	on	the	underside	of	the	ice	,	giving	birth	and	living	out	their	entire	life	cycle	.
this	is	the	foundation	of	the	whole	food	chain	in	the	arctic	,	right	here	.
and	when	you	have	low	productivity	in	this	,	in	ice	,	the	productivity	in	copepods	go	down	.
this	is	a	bowhead	whale	.
supposedly	,	science	is	stating	that	it	could	be	the	oldest	living	animal	on	earth	right	now	.
this	very	whale	right	here	could	be	over	250	years	old	.
this	whale	could	have	been	born	around	the	start	of	the	industrial	revolution	.
it	could	have	survived	150	years	of	whaling	.
and	now	its	biggest	threat	is	the	disappearance	of	ice	in	the	north	because	of	the	lives	that	we	're	leading	in	the	south	.
narwhals	,	these	majestic	narwhals	with	their	eight	-	foot	long	ivory	tusks	,	do	n't	have	to	be	here	;	they	could	be	out	on	the	open	water	.
but	they	're	forcing	themselves	to	come	up	in	these	tiny	little	ice	holes	where	they	can	breathe	,	catch	a	breath	,	because	right	under	that	ice	are	all	the	swarms	of	cod	.
and	the	cod	are	there	because	they	are	feeding	on	all	the	copepods	and	amphipods	.
alright	,	my	favorite	part	.
when	i	'm	on	my	deathbed	,	i	'm	going	to	remember	one	story	more	than	any	other	.
even	though	that	spirit	bear	moment	was	powerful	,	i	do	n't	think	i	'll	ever	have	another	experience	like	i	did	with	these	leopard	seals	.
leopard	seals	,	since	the	time	of	shackleton	,	have	had	a	bad	reputation	.
they	've	got	that	wryly	smile	on	their	mouth	.
they	've	got	those	black	sinister	eyes	and	those	spots	on	their	body	.
they	look	positively	prehistoric	and	a	bit	scary	.
and	tragically	in	[	2003	]	,	a	scientist	was	taken	down	and	drowned	,	and	she	was	being	consumed	by	a	leopard	seal	.
and	people	were	like	,	``	we	knew	they	were	vicious	.	we	knew	they	were	.	``	and	so	people	love	to	form	their	opinions	.
and	that	's	when	i	got	a	story	idea	:	i	want	to	go	to	antarctica	,	get	in	the	water	with	as	many	leopard	seals	as	i	possibly	can	and	give	them	a	fair	shake	--	find	out	if	they	really	are	these	vicious	animals	,	or	if	they	're	misunderstood	.
so	this	is	that	story	.
oh	,	and	they	also	happen	to	eat	happy	feet	.
as	a	species	,	as	humans	,	we	like	to	say	penguins	are	really	cute	,	therefore	,	leopard	seals	eat	them	,	so	leopard	seals	are	ugly	and	bad	.
it	does	n't	work	that	way	.
the	penguin	does	n't	know	it	's	cute	,
and	the	leopard	seal	does	n't	know	it	's	kind	of	big	and	monstrous	.
this	is	just	the	food	chain	unfolding	.
they	're	also	big	.
they	're	not	these	little	harbor	seals	.
they	are	12	ft.	long	,	a	thousand	pounds	.
and	they	're	also	curiously	aggressive	.
you	get	12	tourists	packed	into	a	zodiac	,	floating	in	these	icy	waters	,	and	a	leopard	seal	comes	up	and	bites	the	pontoon	.
the	boat	starts	to	sink	,	they	race	back	to	the	ship	and	get	to	go	home	and	tell	the	stories	of	how	they	got	attacked	.
all	the	leopard	seal	was	doing	--	it	's	just	biting	a	balloon	.
it	just	sees	this	big	balloon	in	the	ocean	--	it	does	n't	have	hands	--	it	's	going	to	take	a	little	bite	,	the	boat	pops	,	and	off	they	go	.
so	after	five	days	of	crossing	the	drake	passage	--	is	n't	that	beautiful	.
after	five	days	of	crossing	the	drake	passage	,	we	have	finally	arrived	at	antarctica	.
i	'm	with	my	swedish	assistant	and	guide	.
his	name	is	goran	ehlme	from	sweden	--	goran	.
and	he	has	a	lot	of	experience	with	leopard	seals	.	i	have	never	seen	one	.
so	we	come	around	the	cove	in	our	little	zodiac	boat	,	and	there	's	this	monstrous	leopard	seal	.
and	even	in	his	voice	,	he	goes	,	``	that	's	a	bloody	big	seal	,	ya	.	``	and	this	seal	is	taking	this	penguin	by	the	head	,	and	it	's	flipping	it	back	and	forth	.
and	what	it	's	trying	to	do	is	turn	that	penguin	inside	-	out	,	so	it	can	eat	the	meat	off	the	bones	,	and	then	it	goes	off	and	gets	another	one	.
and	so	this	leopard	seal	grabbed	another	penguin	,	came	under	the	boat	,	the	zodiac	,	starting	hitting	the	hull	of	the	boat	.
and	we	're	trying	to	not	fall	in	the	water	.
and	we	sit	down	,	and	that	's	when	goran	said	to	me	,	``	this	is	a	good	seal	,	ya	.
it	's	time	for	you	to	get	in	the	water	.	``	and	i	looked	at	goran	,	and	i	said	to	him	,	``	forget	that	.	``	but	i	think	i	probably	used	a	different	word	starting	with	the	letter	f	.
but	he	was	right	.
he	scolded	me	out	,	and	said	,	``	this	is	why	we	're	here	.
and	you	purposed	this	stupid	story	to	national	geographic	.
and	now	you	've	got	to	deliver	.
and	you	ca	n't	publish	excuses	.	``	so	i	had	such	dry	mouth	--	probably	not	as	bad	as	now	--	but	i	had	such	,	such	dry	mouth	.
and	my	legs	were	just	trembling	.	i	could	n't	feel	my	legs	.
i	put	my	flippers	on	.	i	could	barely	part	my	lips	.
i	put	my	snorkel	in	my	mouth	,	and	i	rolled	over	the	side	of	the	zodiac	into	the	water	.
and	this	was	the	first	thing	she	did	.
she	came	racing	up	to	me	,	engulfed	my	whole	camera	--	and	her	teeth	are	up	here	and	down	here	--	but	goran	,	before	i	had	gotten	in	the	water	,	had	given	me	amazing	advice	.
he	said	,	``	if	you	get	scared	,	you	close	your	eyes	,	ya	,	and	she	'll	go	away	.	``	so	that	's	all	i	had	to	work	with	at	that	point	.
but	i	just	started	to	shoot	these	pictures	.
so	she	did	this	threat	display	for	a	few	minutes	,	and	then	the	most	amazing	thing	happened	--	she	totally	relaxed	.
she	went	off	,	she	got	a	penguin	.
she	stopped	about	10	feet	away	from	me	,	and	she	sat	there	with	this	penguin	,	the	penguin	's	flapping	,	and	she	let	's	it	go	.
the	penguin	swims	toward	me	,	takes	off	.
she	grabs	another	one	.	she	does	this	over	and	over	.
and	it	dawned	on	me	that	she	's	trying	to	feed	me	a	penguin	.
why	else	would	she	release	these	penguins	at	me	?
and	after	she	did	this	four	or	five	times	,	she	swam	by	me	with	this	dejected	look	on	her	face	.
you	do	n't	want	to	be	too	anthropomorphic	,	but	i	swear	that	she	looked	at	me	like	,	``	this	useless	predator	's	going	to	starve	in	my	ocean	.	``	so	realizing	i	could	n't	catch	swimming	penguins	,	she	'd	get	these	other	penguins	and	bring	them	slowly	towards	me	,	bobbing	like	this	,	and	she	'd	let	them	go	.
this	did	n't	work	.
i	was	laughing	so	hard	and	so	emotional	that	my	mask	was	flooding	,	because	i	was	crying	underwater	,	just	because	it	was	so	amazing	.
and	so	that	did	n't	work	.
so	then	she	'd	get	another	penguin	and	try	this	ballet	-	like	sexy	display	sliding	down	this	iceberg	like	this	.
and	she	would	sort	of	bring	them	over	to	me	and	offer	it	to	me	.
this	went	on	for	four	days	.
this	just	did	n't	happen	a	couple	of	times	.
and	then	so	she	realized	i	could	n't	catch	live	ones	,	so	she	brought	me	dead	penguins	.
now	i	've	got	four	or	five	penguins	floating	around	my	head	,	and	i	'm	just	sitting	there	shooting	away	.
and	she	would	often	stop	and	have	this	dejected	look	on	her	face	like	,	``	are	you	for	real	?	``	because	she	ca	n't	believe	i	ca	n't	eat	this	penguin	.
because	in	her	world	,	you	're	either	breeding	or	you	're	eating	--	and	i	'm	not	breeding	,	so	...
and	then	that	was	n't	enough	;	she	started	to	flip	penguins	onto	my	head	.
she	was	trying	to	force	-	feed	me	.	she	's	pushing	me	around	.
she	's	trying	to	force	-	feed	my	camera	,	which	is	every	photographer	's	dream	.
and	she	would	get	frustrated	;	she	'd	blow	bubbles	in	my	face	.
she	would	,	i	think	,	let	me	know	that	i	was	going	to	starve	.
but	yet	she	did	n't	stop	.
she	would	not	stop	trying	to	feed	me	penguins	.
and	on	the	last	day	with	this	female	where	i	thought	i	had	pushed	her	too	far	,	i	got	nervous	because	she	came	up	to	me	,	she	rolled	over	on	her	back	,	and	she	did	this	deep	,	guttural	jackhammer	sound	,	this	gokgokgokgok	.
and	i	thought	,	she	's	about	to	bite	.
she	's	about	to	let	me	know	she	's	too	frustrated	with	me	.
what	had	happened	was	another	seal	had	snuck	in	behind	me	,	and	she	did	that	to	threat	display	.
she	chased	that	big	seal	away	,	went	and	got	its	penguin	and	brought	it	to	me	.
that	was	n't	the	only	seal	i	got	in	the	water	with	.
i	got	in	the	water	with	30	other	leopard	seals	,	and	i	never	once	had	a	scary	encounter	.
they	are	the	most	remarkable	animals	i	've	ever	worked	with	,
and	the	same	with	polar	bears	.
and	just	like	the	polar	bears	,	these	animals	depend	on	an	icy	environment	.
i	get	emotional	.	sorry	.
it	's	a	story	that	lives	deep	in	my	heart	,	and	i	'm	proud	to	share	this	with	you	.
and	i	'm	so	passionate	about	it	.
anybody	want	to	come	with	me	to	antarctica	or	the	arctic	,	i	'll	take	you	;	let	's	go	.
we	've	got	to	get	the	story	out	now	.	thank	you	very	much	.
thank	you	.
thank	you	.
thank	you	.	thanks	very	much	.
thank	you	.
