thank	you	.	thank	you	very	much	.
that	was	whistling	.
i	'm	trying	to	do	this	in	english	.
what	is	a	chubby	,	curly	-	haired	guy	from	holland	--	why	is	he	whistling	?
well	actually	,	i	've	[	been	]	whistling	since	the	age	of	four	,	about	four	.
my	dad	was	always	whistling	around	the	house	,	and	i	just	thought	that	's	part	of	communication	in	my	family	.
so	i	whistled	along	with	him	.
and	actually	,	till	i	was	34	,	i	always	annoyed	and	irritated	people	with	whistling	,
because	,	to	be	honest	,	my	whistling	is	a	kind	of	deviant	behavior	.
i	whistled	alone	.	i	whistled	in	the	classroom	.	i	whistled	on	[	my	]	bike	.	i	whistled	everywhere	.
and	i	also	whistled	at	a	christmas	eve	party	with	my	family	-	in	-	law	.
and	they	had	some	,	in	my	opinion	,	terrible	christmas	music	.
and	when	i	hear	music	that	i	do	n't	like	,	i	try	to	make	it	better	.
so	``	rudolph	the	red	-	nosed	reindeer	``	--	you	know	it	?
but	it	can	also	sound	like	this	.
but	during	a	christmas	party	--	at	dinner	actually	--	it	's	very	annoying	.
so	my	sister	-	in	-	law	asked	me	a	few	times	,	``	please	stop	whistling	.	``
and	i	just	could	n't	.
and	at	one	point	--	and	i	had	some	wine	,	i	have	to	admit	that	--	at	one	point	i	said	,	``	if	there	was	a	contest	,	i	would	join	.	``
and	two	weeks	later	i	received	a	text	message	:	``	you	're	going	to	america	.	``
so	,	okay	,	i	'm	going	to	america	.
i	would	love	to	,	but	why	?
so	i	immediately	called	her	up	,	of	course	.
she	googled	,	and	she	found	this	world	whistling	championship	in	america	,	of	course	.
she	did	n't	expect	me	to	go	there	.
and	i	would	have	lost	my	face	.
i	do	n't	know	if	that	's	correct	english	.
but	the	dutch	people	here	will	understand	what	i	mean	.
i	lost	my	face	.
and	she	thought	,	``	he	will	never	go	there	.	``
but	actually	i	did	.
so	i	went	to	louisburg	,	north	carolina	,	southeast	united	states	,
and	i	entered	the	world	of	whistling	.
and	i	also	entered	the	world	championship	,	and	i	won	there	in	2004	.
that	was	great	fun	,	of	course	.
and	to	defend	my	title	--	like	judokas	do	and	sportsmen	--	i	thought	,	well	let	's	go	back	in	2005	,	and	i	won	again	.
then	i	could	n't	participate	for	a	few	years	.
and	in	2008	i	entered	again	in	japan	,	tokyo	,	and	i	won	again	.
so	what	happened	now	is	i	'm	standing	here	in	rotterdam	,	in	the	beautiful	city	,	on	a	big	stage	,	and	i	'm	talking	about	whistling	.
and	actually	i	earn	my	money	whistling	at	the	moment	.
so	i	quit	my	day	job	as	a	nurse	.
and	i	try	to	live	my	dream	--	well	,	actually	,	it	was	never	my	dream	,	but	it	sounds	so	good	.
okay	,	i	'm	not	the	only	one	whistling	here	.
you	say	,	``	huh	,	what	do	you	mean	?	``
well	actually	,	you	are	going	to	whistle	along	.
and	then	always	the	same	thing	happens	:	people	are	watching	each	other	and	think	,	``	oh	,	my	god	.
why	?	can	i	go	away	?	``
no	,	you	ca	n't	.
actually	it	's	very	simple	.
the	track	that	i	will	whistle	is	called	``	fÃªte	de	la	belle	.	``
it	's	about	80	minutes	long	.
no	,	no	,	no	.	it	's	four	minutes	long	.
and	i	want	to	first	rehearse	with	you	your	whistling	.
so	i	whistle	the	tone	.
sorry	.	i	forgot	one	thing	.
you	whistle	the	same	tone	as	me	.
i	heard	a	wide	variety	of	tones	.
this	is	very	promising	.
this	is	very	promising	.
i	'll	ask	the	technicians	to	start	the	music	.
and	if	it	's	started	,	i	just	point	where	you	whistle	along	,
and	we	will	see	what	happens	.
oh	,	hah	.
i	'm	so	sorry	,	technicians	.
i	'm	so	used	to	that	.
i	start	it	myself	.
okay	,	here	it	is	.
okay	.	it	's	easy	,	is	n't	it	?
now	comes	the	solo	.	i	propose	i	do	that	myself	.
max	westerman	:	geert	chatrou	,	the	world	champion	[	of	]	whistling	.
