so	i	'm	going	to	talk	today	about	collecting	stories	in	some	unconventional	ways	.
this	is	a	picture	of	me	from	a	very	awkward	stage	in	my	life	.
you	might	enjoy	the	awkwardly	tight	,	cut	-	off	pajama	bottoms	with	balloons	.
anyway	,	it	was	a	time	when	i	was	mainly	interested	in	collecting	imaginary	stories	.
so	this	is	a	picture	of	me	holding	one	of	the	first	watercolor	paintings	i	ever	made	.
and	recently	i	've	been	much	more	interested	in	collecting	stories	from	reality	--	so	,	real	stories	.
and	specifically	,	i	'm	interested	in	collecting	my	own	stories	,	stories	from	the	internet	,	and	then	recently	,	stories	from	life	,	which	is	kind	of	a	new	area	of	work	that	i	've	been	doing	recently	.
so	i	'll	be	talking	about	each	of	those	today	.
so	,	first	of	all	,	my	own	stories	.	these	are	two	of	my	sketchbooks	.
i	have	many	of	these	books	,	and	i	've	been	keeping	them	for	about	the	last	eight	or	nine	years	.
they	accompany	me	wherever	i	go	in	my	life	,	and	i	fill	them	with	all	sorts	of	things	,	records	of	my	lived	experience	:
so	watercolor	paintings	,	drawings	of	what	i	see	,	dead	flowers	,	dead	insects	,	pasted	ticket	stubs	,	rusting	coins	,	business	cards	,	writings	.
and	in	these	books	,	you	can	find	these	short	,	little	glimpses	of	moments	and	experiences	and	people	that	i	meet	.
and	,	you	know	,	after	keeping	these	books	for	a	number	of	years	,	i	started	to	become	very	interested	in	collecting	not	only	my	own	personal	artifacts	,	but	also	the	artifacts	of	other	people	.
so	,	i	started	collecting	found	objects	.
this	is	a	photograph	i	found	lying	in	a	gutter	in	new	york	city	about	10	years	ago	.
on	the	front	,	you	can	see	the	tattered	black	-	and	-	white	photo	of	a	woman	's	face	,	and	on	the	back	it	says	,	``	to	judy	,	the	girl	with	the	bill	bailey	voice	.	have	fun	in	whatever	you	do	.	``
and	i	really	loved	this	idea	of	the	partial	glimpse	into	somebody	's	life	.	as	opposed	to	knowing	the	whole	story	,	just	knowing	a	little	bit	of	the	story	,	and	then	letting	your	own	mind	fill	in	the	rest	.
and	that	idea	of	a	partial	glimpse	is	something	that	will	come	back	in	a	lot	of	the	work	i	'll	be	showing	later	today	.
so	,	around	this	time	i	was	studying	computer	science	at	princeton	university	,	and	i	noticed	that	it	was	suddenly	possible	to	collect	these	sorts	of	personal	artifacts	,	not	just	from	street	corners	,	but	also	from	the	internet	.
and	that	suddenly	,	people	,	en	masse	,	were	leaving	scores	and	scores	of	digital	footprints	online	that	told	stories	of	their	private	lives	.
blog	posts	,	photographs	,	thoughts	,	feelings	,	opinions	,	all	of	these	things	were	being	expressed	by	people	online	,	and	leaving	behind	trails	.
so	,	i	started	to	write	computer	programs	that	study	very	,	very	large	sets	of	these	online	footprints	.
one	such	project	is	about	a	year	and	a	half	old	.
it	's	called	``	we	feel	fine	.	``
this	is	a	project	that	scans	the	world	's	newly	posted	blog	entries	every	two	or	three	minutes	,	searching	for	occurrences	of	the	phrases	``	i	feel	``	and	``	i	am	feeling	.	``	and	when	it	finds	one	of	those	phrases	,	it	grabs	the	full	sentence	up	to	the	period	and	also	tries	to	identify	demographic	information	about	the	author	.
so	,	their	gender	,	their	age	,	their	geographic	location	and	what	the	weather	conditions	were	like	when	they	wrote	that	sentence	.
it	collects	about	20,000	such	sentences	a	day	and	it	's	been	running	for	about	a	year	and	a	half	,	having	collected	over	10	and	a	half	million	feelings	now	.
this	is	,	then	,	how	they	're	presented	.
these	dots	here	represent	some	of	the	english	-	speaking	world	's	feelings	from	the	last	few	hours	,
each	dot	being	a	single	sentence	stated	by	a	single	blogger	.
and	the	color	of	each	dot	corresponds	to	the	type	of	feeling	inside	,	so	the	bright	ones	are	happy	,	and	the	dark	ones	are	sad	.
and	the	diameter	of	each	dot	corresponds	to	the	length	of	the	sentence	inside	.
so	the	small	ones	are	short	,	and	the	bigger	ones	are	longer	.
``	i	feel	fine	with	the	body	i	'm	in	,	there	'll	be	no	easy	excuse	for	why	i	still	feel	uncomfortable	being	close	to	my	boyfriend	,	``	from	a	twenty	-	two	-	year	-	old	in	japan	.
``	i	got	this	on	some	trading	locally	,	but	really	do	n't	feel	like	screwing	with	wiring	and	crap	.	``
also	,	some	of	the	feelings	contain	photographs	in	the	blog	posts	.	and	when	that	happens	,	these	montage	compositions	are	automatically	created	,	which	consist	of	the	sentence	and	images	being	combined	.
and	any	of	these	can	be	opened	up	to	reveal	the	sentence	inside	.
``	i	feel	good	.	``
``	i	feel	rough	now	,	and	i	probably	gained	100,000	pounds	,	but	it	was	worth	it	.	``
``	i	love	how	they	were	able	to	preserve	most	in	everything	that	makes	you	feel	close	to	nature	--	butterflies	,	man	-	made	forests	,	limestone	caves	and	hey	,	even	a	huge	python	.	``
so	the	next	movement	is	called	mobs	.
this	provides	a	slightly	more	statistical	look	at	things	.
this	is	showing	the	world	's	most	common	feelings	overall	right	now	,	dominated	by	better	,	then	bad	,	then	good	,	then	guilty	,	and	so	on	.
weather	causes	the	feelings	to	assume	the	physical	traits	of	the	weather	they	represent	.	so	the	sunny	ones	swirl	around	,	the	cloudy	ones	float	along	,	the	rainy	ones	fall	down	,	and	the	snowy	ones	flutter	to	the	ground	.
you	can	also	stop	a	raindrop	and	open	the	feeling	inside	.
finally	,	location	causes	the	feelings	to	move	to	their	spots	on	a	world	map	,	giving	you	a	sense	of	their	geographic	distribution	.
so	i	'll	show	you	now	some	of	my	favorite	montages	from	``	we	feel	fine	.	``
these	are	the	images	that	are	automatically	constructed	.
``	i	feel	like	i	'm	diagonally	parked	in	a	parallel	universe	.	``
``	i	've	kissed	numerous	other	boys	and	it	has	n't	felt	good	,	the	kisses	felt	messy	and	wrong	,	but	kissing	lucas	feels	beautiful	and	almost	spiritual	.	``
``	i	can	feel	my	cancer	grow	.	``
``	i	feel	pretty	.	``
``	i	feel	skinny	,	but	i	'm	not	.	``
``	i	'm	23	,	and	a	recovering	meth	and	heroin	addict	,	and	feel	absolutely	blessed	to	still	be	alive	.	``
``	i	ca	n't	wait	to	see	them	racing	for	the	first	time	at	daytona	next	month	,	because	i	feel	the	need	for	speed	.	``
``	i	feel	sassy	.	``
``	i	feel	so	sexy	in	this	new	wig	.	``
as	you	can	see	,	``	we	feel	fine	``	collects	very	,	very	small	-	scale	personal	stories	.
sometimes	,	stories	as	short	as	two	or	three	words	.
so	,	really	even	challenging	the	notion	of	what	can	be	considered	a	story	.
and	recently	,	i	've	become	interested	in	diving	much	more	deeply	into	a	single	story	.
and	that	's	led	me	to	doing	some	work	with	the	physical	world	,	not	with	the	internet	,	and	only	using	the	internet	at	the	very	last	moment	,	as	a	presentation	medium	.
so	these	are	some	newer	projects	that	actually	are	n't	even	launched	publicly	yet	.
the	first	such	one	is	called	``	the	whale	hunt	.	``	last	may	,	i	spent	nine	days	living	up	in	barrow	,	alaska	,	the	northernmost	settlement	in	the	united	states	,	with	a	family	of	inupiat	eskimos	,	documenting	their	annual	spring	whale	hunt	.
this	is	the	whaling	camp	here	,	we	're	about	six	miles	from	shore	,	camping	on	five	and	a	half	feet	of	thick	,	frozen	pack	ice	.
and	that	water	that	you	see	there	is	the	open	lead	,	and	through	that	lead	,	bowhead	whales	migrate	north	each	springtime	.
and	the	eskimo	community	basically	camps	out	on	the	edge	of	the	ice	here	,	waits	for	a	whale	to	come	close	enough	to	attack	.	and	when	it	does	,	it	throws	a	harpoon	at	it	,	and	then	hauls	the	whale	up	under	the	ice	,	and	cuts	it	up	.
and	that	would	provide	the	community	's	food	supply	for	a	long	time	.
so	i	went	up	there	,	and	i	lived	with	these	guys	out	in	their	whaling	camp	here	,	and	photographed	the	entire	experience	,	beginning	with	the	taxi	ride	to	newark	airport	in	new	york	,	and	ending	with	the	butchering	of	the	second	whale	,	seven	and	a	half	days	later	.
i	photographed	that	entire	experience	at	five	-	minute	intervals	.
so	every	five	minutes	,	i	took	a	photograph	.
when	i	was	awake	,	with	the	camera	around	my	neck	.	when	i	was	sleeping	,	with	a	tripod	and	a	timer	.
and	then	in	moments	of	high	adrenaline	,	like	when	something	exciting	was	happening	,	i	would	up	that	photographic	frequency	to	as	many	as	37	photographs	in	five	minutes	.
so	what	this	created	was	a	photographic	heartbeat	that	sped	up	and	slowed	down	,	more	or	less	matching	the	changing	pace	of	my	own	heartbeat	.
that	was	the	first	concept	here	.
the	second	concept	was	to	use	this	experience	to	think	about	the	fundamental	components	of	any	story	.
what	are	the	things	that	make	up	a	story	?
so	,	stories	have	characters	.	stories	have	concepts	.
stories	take	place	in	a	certain	area	.	they	have	contexts	.
they	have	colors	.	what	do	they	look	like	?
they	have	time	.	when	did	it	take	place	?	dates	--	when	did	it	occur	?
and	in	the	case	of	the	whale	hunt	,	also	this	idea	of	an	excitement	level	.
the	thing	about	stories	,	though	,	in	most	of	the	existing	mediums	that	we	're	accustomed	to	--	things	like	novels	,	radio	,	photographs	,	movies	,	even	lectures	like	this	one	--	we	're	very	accustomed	to	this	idea	of	the	narrator	or	the	camera	position	,
some	kind	of	omniscient	,	external	body	through	whose	eyes	you	see	the	story	.
we	're	very	used	to	this	.
but	if	you	think	about	real	life	,	it	's	not	like	that	at	all	.
i	mean	,	in	real	life	,	things	are	much	more	nuanced	and	complex	,	and	there	's	all	of	these	overlapping	stories	intersecting	and	touching	each	other	.
and	so	i	thought	it	would	be	interesting	to	build	a	framework	to	surface	those	types	of	stories	.	so	,	in	the	case	of	``	the	whale	hunt	,	``	how	could	we	extract	something	like	the	story	of	simeon	and	crawford	,	involving	the	concepts	of	wildlife	,	tools	and	blood	,	taking	place	on	the	arctic	ocean	,	dominated	by	the	color	red	,	happening	around	10	a.m.	on	may	3	,	with	an	excitement	level	of	high	?
so	,	how	to	extract	this	order	of	narrative	from	this	larger	story	?
i	built	a	web	interface	for	viewing	``	the	whale	hunt	``	that	attempts	to	do	just	this	.
so	these	are	all	3,214	pictures	taken	up	there	.
this	is	my	studio	in	brooklyn	.	this	is	the	arctic	ocean	,	and	the	butchering	of	the	second	whale	,	seven	days	later	.
you	can	start	to	see	some	of	the	story	here	,	told	by	color	.
so	this	red	strip	signifies	the	color	of	the	wallpaper	in	the	basement	apartment	where	i	was	staying	.
and	things	go	white	as	we	move	out	onto	the	arctic	ocean	.
introduction	of	red	down	here	,	when	whales	are	being	cut	up	.
you	can	see	a	timeline	,	showing	you	the	exciting	moments	throughout	the	story	.
these	are	organized	chronologically	.
wheel	provides	a	slightly	more	playful	version	of	the	same	,	so	these	are	also	all	the	photographs	organized	chronologically	.
and	any	of	these	can	be	clicked	,	and	then	the	narrative	is	entered	at	that	position	.
so	here	i	am	sleeping	on	the	airplane	heading	up	to	alaska	.
that	's	``	moby	dick	.	``
this	is	the	food	we	ate	.
this	is	in	the	patkotak	's	family	living	room	in	their	house	in	barrow	.	the	boxed	wine	they	served	us	.
cigarette	break	outside	--	i	do	n't	smoke	.
this	is	a	really	exciting	sequence	of	me	sleeping	.
this	is	out	at	whale	camp	,	on	the	arctic	ocean	.
this	graph	that	i	'm	clicking	down	here	is	meant	to	be	reminiscent	of	a	medical	heartbeat	graph	,	showing	the	exciting	moments	of	adrenaline	.
this	is	the	ice	starting	to	freeze	over	.	the	snow	fence	they	built	.
and	so	what	i	'll	show	you	now	is	the	ability	to	pull	out	sub	-	stories	.
so	,	here	you	see	the	cast	.	these	are	all	of	the	people	in	``	the	whale	hunt	``	and	the	two	whales	that	were	killed	down	here	.
and	we	could	do	something	as	arbitrary	as	,	say	,	extract	the	story	of	rony	,	involving	the	concepts	of	blood	and	whales	and	tools	,	taking	place	on	the	arctic	ocean	,	at	ahkivgaq	camp	,	with	the	heartbeat	level	of	fast	.
and	now	we	've	whittled	down	that	whole	story	to	just	29	matching	photographs	,	and	then	we	can	enter	the	narrative	at	that	position	.
and	you	can	see	rony	cutting	up	the	whale	here	.
these	whales	are	about	40	feet	long	,	and	weighing	over	40	tons	.	and	they	provide	the	food	source	for	the	community	for	much	of	the	year	.
skipping	ahead	a	bit	more	here	,	this	is	rony	on	the	whale	carcass	.
they	use	no	chainsaws	or	anything	;	it	's	entirely	just	blades	,	and	an	incredibly	efficient	process	.
this	is	the	guys	on	the	rope	,	pulling	open	the	carcass	.
this	is	the	muktuk	,	or	the	blubber	,	all	lined	up	for	community	distribution	.
it	's	baleen	.	moving	on	.
so	what	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	about	next	is	a	very	new	thing	.	it	's	not	even	a	project	yet	.
so	,	just	yesterday	,	i	flew	in	here	from	singapore	,	and	before	that	,	i	was	spending	two	weeks	in	bhutan	,	the	small	himalayan	kingdom	nestled	between	tibet	and	india	.
and	i	was	doing	a	project	there	about	happiness	,	interviewing	a	lot	of	local	people	.
so	bhutan	has	this	really	wacky	thing	where	they	base	most	of	their	high	-	level	governmental	decisions	around	the	concept	of	gross	national	happiness	instead	of	gross	domestic	product	,	and	they	've	been	doing	this	since	the	'70s	.
and	it	leads	to	just	a	completely	different	value	system	.
it	's	an	incredibly	non	-	materialistic	culture	,	where	people	do	n't	have	a	lot	,	but	they	're	incredibly	happy	.
so	i	went	around	and	i	talked	to	people	about	some	of	these	ideas	.
so	,	i	did	a	number	of	things	.	i	asked	people	a	number	of	set	questions	,	and	took	a	number	of	set	photographs	,	and	interviewed	them	with	audio	,	and	also	took	pictures	.
i	would	start	by	asking	people	to	rate	their	happiness	between	one	and	10	,	which	is	kind	of	inherently	absurd	.
and	then	when	they	answered	,	i	would	inflate	that	number	of	balloons	and	give	them	that	number	of	balloons	to	hold	.
so	,	you	have	some	really	happy	person	holding	10	balloons	,	and	some	really	sad	soul	holding	one	balloon	.
but	you	know	,	even	holding	one	balloon	is	like	,	kind	of	happy	.
and	then	i	would	ask	them	a	number	of	questions	like	what	was	the	happiest	day	in	their	life	,	what	makes	them	happy	.
and	then	finally	,	i	would	ask	them	to	make	a	wish	.
and	when	they	made	a	wish	,	i	would	write	their	wish	onto	one	of	the	balloons	and	take	a	picture	of	them	holding	it	.
so	i	'm	going	to	show	you	now	just	a	few	brief	snippets	of	some	of	the	interviews	that	i	did	,	some	of	the	people	i	spoke	with	.
this	is	an	11	-	year	-	old	student	.
he	was	playing	cops	and	robbers	with	his	friends	,	running	around	town	,	and	they	all	had	plastic	toy	guns	.
his	wish	was	to	become	a	police	officer	.
he	was	getting	started	early	.	those	were	his	hands	.
i	took	pictures	of	everybody	's	hands	,	because	i	think	you	can	often	tell	a	lot	about	somebody	from	how	their	hands	look	.	i	took	a	portrait	of	everybody	,	and	asked	everybody	to	make	a	funny	face	.
a	17	-	year	-	old	student	.	her	wish	was	to	have	been	born	a	boy	.
she	thinks	that	women	have	a	pretty	tough	go	of	things	in	bhutan	,	and	it	's	a	lot	easier	if	you	're	a	boy	.
a	28	-	year	-	old	cell	phone	shop	owner	.
if	you	knew	what	paro	looked	like	,	you	'd	understand	how	amazing	it	is	that	there	's	a	cell	phone	shop	there	.
he	wanted	to	help	poor	people	.
a	53	-	year	-	old	farmer	.	she	was	chaffing	wheat	,	and	that	pile	of	wheat	behind	her	had	taken	her	about	a	week	to	make	.
she	wanted	to	keep	farming	until	she	dies	.
you	can	really	start	to	see	the	stories	told	by	the	hands	here	.
she	was	wearing	this	silver	ring	that	had	the	word	``	love	``	engraved	on	it	,	and	she	'd	found	it	in	the	road	somewhere	.
a	16	-	year	-	old	quarry	worker	.
this	guy	was	breaking	rocks	with	a	hammer	in	the	hot	sunlight	,	but	he	just	wanted	to	spend	his	life	as	a	farmer	.
a	21	-	year	-	old	monk	.	he	was	very	happy	.
he	wanted	to	live	a	long	life	at	the	monastery	.
he	had	this	amazing	series	of	hairs	growing	out	of	a	mole	on	the	left	side	of	his	face	,	which	i	'm	told	is	very	good	luck	.
he	was	kind	of	too	shy	to	make	a	funny	face	.
a	16	-	year	-	old	student	.
she	wanted	to	become	an	independent	woman	.
i	asked	her	about	that	,	and	she	said	she	meant	that	she	does	n't	want	to	be	married	,	because	,	in	her	opinion	,	when	you	get	married	in	bhutan	as	a	woman	,	your	chances	to	live	an	independent	life	kind	of	end	,	and	so	she	had	no	interest	in	that	.
a	24	-	year	-	old	truck	driver	.
there	are	these	terrifyingly	huge	indian	trucks	that	come	careening	around	one	-	lane	roads	with	two	-	lane	traffic	,	with	3,000	-	foot	drop	-	offs	right	next	to	the	road	,	and	he	was	driving	one	of	these	trucks	.
but	all	he	wanted	was	to	just	live	a	comfortable	life	,	like	other	people	.
a	24	-	year	-	old	road	sweeper	.	i	caught	her	on	her	lunch	break	.
she	'd	built	a	little	fire	to	keep	warm	,	right	next	to	the	road	.
her	wish	was	to	marry	someone	with	a	car	.
she	wanted	a	change	in	her	life	.
she	lives	in	a	little	worker	's	camp	right	next	to	the	road	,	and	she	wanted	a	different	lot	on	things	.
an	81	-	year	-	old	itinerant	farmer	.
i	saw	this	guy	on	the	side	of	the	road	,	and	he	actually	does	n't	have	a	home	.
he	travels	from	farm	to	farm	each	day	trying	to	find	work	,	and	then	he	tries	to	sleep	at	whatever	farm	he	gets	work	at	.
so	his	wish	was	to	come	with	me	,	so	that	he	had	somewhere	to	live	.
he	had	this	amazing	knife	that	he	pulled	out	of	his	gho	and	started	brandishing	when	i	asked	him	to	make	a	funny	face	.
it	was	all	good	-	natured	.
a	10	-	year	-	old	.
he	wanted	to	join	a	school	and	learn	to	read	,	but	his	parents	did	n't	have	enough	money	to	send	him	to	school	.
he	was	eating	this	orange	,	sugary	candy	that	he	kept	dipping	his	fingers	into	,	and	since	there	was	so	much	saliva	on	his	hands	,	this	orange	paste	started	to	form	on	his	palms	.
a	37	-	year	-	old	road	worker	.
one	of	the	more	touchy	political	subjects	in	bhutan	is	the	use	of	indian	cheap	labor	that	they	import	from	india	to	build	the	roads	,	and	then	they	send	these	people	home	once	the	roads	are	built	.
so	these	guys	were	in	a	worker	's	gang	mixing	up	asphalt	one	morning	on	the	side	of	the	highway	.
his	wish	was	to	make	some	money	and	open	a	store	.
a	75	-	year	-	old	farmer	.	she	was	selling	oranges	on	the	side	of	the	road	.
i	asked	her	about	her	wish	,	and	she	said	,	``	you	know	,	maybe	i	'll	live	,	maybe	i	'll	die	,	but	i	do	n't	have	a	wish	.	``
she	was	chewing	betel	nut	,	which	caused	her	teeth	over	the	years	to	turn	very	red	.
finally	,	this	is	a	26	-	year	-	old	nun	i	spoke	to	.
her	wish	was	to	make	a	pilgrimage	to	tibet	.
i	asked	her	how	long	she	planned	to	live	in	the	nunnery	and	she	said	,	``	well	,	you	know	,	of	course	,	it	's	impermanent	,	but	my	plan	is	to	live	here	until	i	'm	30	,	and	then	enter	a	hermitage	.	``
and	i	said	,	``	you	mean	,	like	a	cave	?	``	and	she	said	,	``	yeah	,	like	a	cave	.	``
and	i	said	,	``	wow	,	and	how	long	will	you	live	in	the	cave	?	``
and	she	said	,	``	well	,	you	know	,	i	think	i	'd	kind	of	like	to	live	my	whole	life	in	the	cave	.	``
i	just	thought	that	was	amazing	.	i	mean	,	she	spoke	in	a	way	--	with	amazing	english	,	and	amazing	humor	,	and	amazing	laughter	--	that	made	her	seem	like	somebody	i	could	have	bumped	into	on	the	streets	of	new	york	,	or	in	vermont	,	where	i	'm	from	.
but	here	she	had	been	living	in	a	nunnery	for	the	last	seven	years	.
i	asked	her	a	little	bit	more	about	the	cave	and	what	she	planned	would	happen	once	she	went	there	,	you	know	.
what	if	she	saw	the	truth	after	just	one	year	,	what	would	she	do	for	the	next	35	years	in	her	life	?
and	this	is	what	she	said	.
woman	:	i	think	i	'm	going	to	stay	for	35.	maybe	--	maybe	i	'll	die	.
jonathan	harris	:	maybe	you	'll	die	?	woman	:	yes	.
jh	:	10	years	?	woman	:	yes	,	yes	.	jh	:	10	years	,	that	's	a	long	time	.
woman	:	yes	,	not	maybe	one	,	10	years	,	maybe	i	can	die	within	one	year	,	or	something	like	that	.
jh	:	are	you	hoping	to	?
woman	:	ah	,	because	you	know	,	it	's	impermanent	.
jh	:	yeah	,	but	--	yeah	,	ok	.	do	you	hope	--	would	you	prefer	to	live	in	the	cave	for	40	years	,	or	to	live	for	one	year	?
woman	:	but	i	prefer	for	maybe	40	to	50	.
jh	:	40	to	50	?	yeah	.
woman	:	yes	.	from	then	,	i	'm	going	to	the	heaven	.
jh	:	well	,	i	wish	you	the	best	of	luck	with	it	.
woman	:	thank	you	.
jh	:	i	hope	it	's	everything	that	you	hope	it	will	be	.
so	thank	you	again	,	so	much	.
woman	:	you	're	most	welcome	.
jh	:	so	if	you	caught	that	,	she	said	she	hoped	to	die	when	she	was	around	40.	that	was	enough	life	for	her	.
so	,	the	last	thing	we	did	,	very	quickly	,	is	i	took	all	those	wish	balloons	--	there	were	117	interviews	,	117	wishes	--	and	i	brought	them	up	to	a	place	called	dochula	,	which	is	a	mountain	pass	in	bhutan	,	at	10,300	feet	,	one	of	the	more	sacred	places	in	bhutan	.
and	up	there	,	there	are	thousands	of	prayer	flags	that	people	have	spread	out	over	the	years	.
and	we	re	-	inflated	all	of	the	balloons	,	put	them	up	on	a	string	,	and	hung	them	up	there	among	the	prayer	flags	.
and	they	're	actually	still	flying	up	there	today	.
so	if	any	of	you	have	any	bhutan	travel	plans	in	the	near	future	,	you	can	go	check	these	out	.	here	are	some	images	from	that	.
we	said	a	buddhist	prayer	so	that	all	these	wishes	could	come	true	.
you	can	start	to	see	some	familiar	balloons	here	.
``	to	make	some	money	and	to	open	a	store	``	was	the	indian	road	worker	.
thanks	very	much	.
