over	the	last	13	years	--	one	,	three	,	13	years	--	i	've	been	part	of	an	exceptional	team	at	insightec	in	israel	and	partners	around	the	world	for	taking	this	idea	,	this	concept	,	noninvasive	surgery	,	from	the	research	lab	to	routine	clinical	use	.
and	this	is	what	i	'll	tell	you	about	.
13	years	--	for	some	of	you	,	you	can	empathize	with	that	number	.
for	me	,	today	,	on	this	date	,	it	's	like	a	second	bar	mitzvah	experience	.
so	this	dream	is	really	enabled	by	the	convergence	of	two	known	technologies	.
one	is	the	focused	ultrasound	,	and	the	other	one	is	the	vision	-	enabled	magnetic	resonance	imaging	.
so	let	's	first	talk	about	focused	ultrasound	.
and	i	hold	in	my	hand	a	tissue	-	mimicking	phantom	.
it	is	made	out	of	silicon	.
it	is	transparent	,	made	just	for	you	.
so	you	see	,	it	's	all	intact	,	completely	transparent	.
i	'll	take	you	now	to	the	acoustic	lab	.
you	see	the	phantom	within	the	aquarium	.
this	is	a	setup	i	put	in	a	physics	lab	.
on	the	right	-	hand	side	,	you	see	an	ultrasonic	transducer	.
so	the	ultrasonic	transducer	emits	basically	an	ultrasonic	beam	that	focuses	inside	the	phantom	.
okay	,	when	you	hear	the	click	,	this	is	when	the	energy	starts	to	emit	and	you	see	a	little	lesion	form	inside	the	phantom	.
okay	,	so	everything	around	it	is	whole	and	intact	.
it	's	just	a	lesion	formed	inside	.
so	think	about	,	this	is	in	your	brain	.
we	need	to	reach	a	target	inside	the	brain	.
we	can	do	it	without	harming	any	tissue	.
so	this	is	,	i	think	,	the	first	kosher	hippocratic	surgical	system	.
okay	,	so	let	's	talk	a	little	bit	about	ultrasound	,	the	force	of	ultrasound	.
you	know	all	about	imaging	,	right	,	ultrasound	imaging	.
and	you	know	also	about	lithotripsy	--	breaking	kidney	stones	.
but	ultrasound	can	be	shaped	to	be	anything	in	between	,	because	it	's	a	mechanical	force	.
basically	,	it	's	a	force	acting	on	a	tissue	that	it	transverses	.
so	you	can	change	the	intensity	,	the	frequency	,	the	duration	,	the	pulse	shape	of	the	ultrasound	to	create	anything	from	an	airbrush	to	a	hammer	.
and	i	am	going	to	show	you	multiple	applications	in	the	medical	field	that	can	be	enabled	just	by	focusing	,	physically	focusing	.
so	this	idea	of	harnessing	focused	ultrasound	to	treat	lesions	in	the	brain	is	not	new	at	all	.
when	i	was	born	,	this	idea	was	already	conceived	by	pioneers	such	as	the	fry	brothers	and	lars	leksell	,	who	is	know	actually	as	the	inventor	of	the	gammaknife	.
but	you	may	not	know	that	he	tried	to	perform	lobotomies	in	the	brain	,	noninvasively	,	with	focused	ultrasound	in	the	'50s	.
he	failed	,	so	he	then	invented	the	gammaknife	.
and	it	makes	you	ponder	why	those	pioneers	failed	.
and	there	was	something	fundamental	that	they	were	missing	.
they	were	missing	the	vision	.
it	was	n't	until	the	invention	of	the	mr	and	really	the	integration	of	mr	with	focused	ultrasound	that	we	could	get	the	feedback	--	both	the	anatomical	and	the	physiological	in	order	to	have	a	completely	noninvasive	,	closed	-	loop	surgical	procedure	.
so	this	is	how	it	looks	,	you	know	,	the	operating	room	of	the	future	today	.
this	is	an	mr	suite	with	a	focused	ultrasound	system	.
and	i	will	give	you	several	examples	.
so	the	first	one	is	in	the	brain	.
one	of	the	neurological	conditions	that	can	be	treated	with	focused	ultrasound	are	movement	disorders	,	like	parkinson	's	or	essential	tremor	.
what	is	typical	to	those	conditions	,	to	essential	tremor	for	example	,	is	inability	to	drink	or	eat	cereal	or	soup	without	spilling	everything	all	over	you	,	or	write	legibly	so	people	can	understand	it	,	and	be	really	independent	in	your	life	without	the	help	of	others	.
so	i	'd	like	you	to	meet	john	.
john	is	a	retired	professor	of	history	from	virginia	.
so	he	suffered	from	essential	tremor	for	many	years	.
and	medication	did	n't	help	him	anymore	.
and	many	of	those	patients	refused	to	undergo	surgery	to	have	people	cut	into	their	brain	.
and	about	four	or	five	months	ago	,	he	underwent	an	experimental	procedure	.
it	is	approved	under	an	fdaide	at	the	university	of	virginia	in	charlottesville
using	focused	ultrasound	to	ablate	a	point	in	his	thalamus	.
and	this	is	his	handwriting	.
``	on	june	20th	,	``	if	you	can	read	it	,	``	2011	.	``
this	is	his	handwriting	on	the	morning	of	the	treatment	before	going	into	the	mr
so	now	i	'll	take	you	through	[	what	]	a	typical	procedure	like	that	looks	like	,	[	what	]	noninvasive	surgery	looks	like	.
so	we	put	the	patient	on	the	mr	table	.
we	attach	a	transducer	,	in	this	case	,	to	the	brain	,	but	if	it	will	be	a	different	organ	,	it	will	be	a	different	transducer	attached	to	the	patient	.
and	the	physician	will	then	take	a	regular	mr	scan	.
and	the	objective	of	that	?
i	do	n't	have	a	pointer	here	,	but	you	see	the	green	,	sort	of	rectangle	or	trapezoid	?
this	is	the	sort	of	general	area	of	the	treatment	.
it	's	a	safety	boundary	around	the	target	.
it	's	a	target	in	the	thalamus	.
so	once	those	pictures	are	acquired	and	the	physician	has	drawn	all	the	necessary	safety	limits	and	so	on	,	he	selects	basically	a	point	--	you	see	the	round	point	in	the	middle	where	the	cursor	is	--	and	he	presses	this	blue	button	called	``	sonicate	.	``
we	call	this	instance	of	injecting	the	energy	,	the	only	handwork	the	physician	does	here	is	moving	a	mouse	.
this	is	the	only	device	he	needs	in	this	treatment	.
so	he	presses	``	sonicate	,	``	and	this	is	what	happens	.
you	see	the	transducer	,	the	light	blue	.
there	's	water	in	between	the	skull	and	the	transducer	.
and	it	does	this	burst	of	energy	.
it	elevates	the	temperature	.
we	first	need	to	verify	that	we	are	on	target	.
so	the	first	sonication	is	at	lower	energy	.
it	does	n't	do	any	damage	,	but	it	elevates	the	temperature	by	a	few	degrees	.
and	one	of	the	unique	capabilities	that	we	leverage	with	the	mr	is	the	ability	to	measure	temperature	noninvasively	.
this	is	really	a	unique	capability	of	the	mr	.
it	is	not	being	used	in	regular	diagnostic	imaging	.
but	here	we	can	get	both	the	anatomical	imaging	and	the	temperature	maps	in	real	time	.
and	you	can	see	the	points	there	on	the	graph	.
the	temperature	was	raised	to	43	degrees	c	temporarily	.
this	does	n't	cause	any	damage	.
but	the	point	is	we	are	right	on	target	.
so	once	the	physician	verifies	that	the	focus	spot	is	on	the	target	he	has	chosen	,	then	we	move	to	perform	a	full	-	energy	ablation	like	you	see	here	.
and	you	see	the	temperature	rises	to	like	55	to	60	degrees	c	.
if	you	do	it	for	more	than	a	second	,	it	's	enough	to	basically	destroy	the	proteins	of	the	cells	.
this	is	the	outcome	from	a	patient	perspective	--	same	day	after	the	treatment	.
this	is	an	immediate	relief	.
thank	you	.
john	is	one	of	[	about	]	a	dozen	very	heroic	,	courageous	people	who	volunteered	for	the	study	.
and	you	have	to	understand	what	is	in	people	's	mind	when	they	are	willing	to	take	the	risk	.
and	this	is	a	quote	from	john	after	he	wrote	it	.
he	said	,	``	miraculous	.	``
and	his	wife	said	,	``	this	is	the	happiest	moment	of	my	life	.	``
and	you	wonder	why	.
i	mean	,	one	of	the	messages	i	like	to	carry	over	is	,	what	about	defending	quality	of	life	?
i	mean	,	those	people	lose	their	independence	.
they	are	dependent	on	others	.
and	john	today	is	fully	independent	.
he	returned	to	a	normal	life	routine	.
and	he	also	plays	golf	,	like	you	do	in	virginia	when	you	are	retired	.
okay	,	so	you	can	see	here	the	spot	.
it	's	like	three	millimeters	in	the	middle	of	the	brain	.
there	's	no	damage	outside	.
he	suffers	from	no	neurodeficit	.
there	's	no	recovery	needed	,	no	nothing	.
he	's	back	to	his	normal	life	.
let	's	move	now	to	a	more	painful	subject	.
pain	is	something	that	can	make	your	life	miserable	.
and	people	are	suffering	from	all	kinds	of	pain	like	neuropathic	pain	,	lower	-	back	pain	and	cancer	pain	from	bone	metastases	,	when	the	metastases	get	to	your	bones	,	sometimes	they	are	very	painful	.
all	those	i	've	indicated	have	already	been	shown	to	be	successfully	treated	by	focused	ultrasound	relieving	the	pain	,	again	,	very	fast	.
and	i	would	like	to	tell	you	about	pj	.
he	's	a	78	year	-	old	farmer	who	suffered	from	--	how	should	i	say	it	?	--	it	's	called	pain	in	the	butt	.
he	had	metastases	in	his	right	buttock	,	and	he	could	n't	sit	even	with	medication	.
he	had	to	forgo	all	the	farm	activities	.
he	was	treated	with	radiation	therapy	,	state	-	of	-	the	-	art	radiation	therapy	,	but	it	did	n't	help	.
many	patients	like	that	favor	radiation	therapy	.
and	again	,	he	volunteered	to	a	pivotal	study	that	we	ran	worldwide	,	also	in	the	u.s.	and	his	wife	actually	took	him	.
they	drove	like	three	hours	from	their	farm	to	the	hospital	.
he	had	to	sit	on	a	cushion	,	stand	still	,	not	move	,	because	it	was	very	painful	.
he	took	the	treatment	,	and	on	the	way	back	,	he	drove	the	truck	by	himself	.
so	again	,	this	is	an	immediate	relief	.
and	you	have	to	understand	what	those	people	feel	and	what	their	family	experiences	when	it	happens	.
he	returned	again	to	his	daily	routine	on	the	farm	.
he	rides	his	tractor	.
he	rides	his	horse	to	their	mountain	cabin	regularly	.
and	he	has	been	very	happy	.
but	now	,	you	ask	me	,	but	what	about	war	,	the	war	on	cancer	?
show	us	some	primary	cancer	.
what	can	be	done	there	?
so	i	have	good	news	and	bad	news	.
the	good	news	:	there	's	a	lot	that	can	be	done	.
and	it	has	been	shown	actually	outside	of	the	u.s	.
and	doing	that	in	the	u.s.	is	very	painful	.
i	do	n't	see	,	without	this	nation	taking	it	as	some	collective	will	or	something	that	is	a	national	goal	to	make	that	happen	,	it	will	not	happen	.
and	it	's	not	just	because	of	regulation	;	it	's	because	of	the	amount	of	money	needed	under	the	current	evidence	-	based	medicine	and	the	size	of	trials	and	so	on
to	make	it	happen	.
so	the	first	two	applications	are	breast	cancer	and	prostate	cancer	.
they	were	the	first	to	be	treated	by	focused	ultrasound	.
and	we	have	better	-	than	-	surgery	results	in	breasts	.
but	i	have	a	message	for	the	men	here	.
we	heard	here	yesterday	quyen	talking	about	the	adverse	event	trait	in	prostate	cancer	.
there	is	a	unique	opportunity	now	with	focused	ultrasound	guided	by	mr	,	because	we	can	actually	think	about	prostate	lumpectomy	--	treating	just	the	focal	lesion	and	not	removing	the	whole	gland	,	and	by	that	,	avoiding	all	the	issues	with	potency	and	incontinence	.
well	,	there	are	other	cancer	tumors	in	the	abdomen	--	quite	lethal	,	very	lethal	actually	--	pancreas	,	liver	,	kidney	.
the	challenge	there	with	a	breathing	and	awake	patient	--	and	in	all	our	treatments	,	the	patient	is	awake	and	conscious	and	speaks	with	the	physician	--	is	you	have	to	teach	the	mr	some	tricks	how	to	do	it	in	real	time	.
and	this	will	take	time	.
this	will	take	two	years	.
but	i	have	now	a	message	to	the	ladies	.
and	this	is	,	in	2004	,	the	fda	has	approved	mr	-	guided	focused	ultrasounds	for	the	treatment	of	symptomatic	uterine	fibroids	.
women	suffer	from	that	disease	.
all	those	tumors	have	heavy	bleeding	during	periods	,	abdominal	pressure	,	back	pain	,	frequent	urination	.
and	sometimes	,	they	can	not	even	conceive	and	become	pregnant	because	of	the	fibroid	.
this	is	frances	.
she	was	diagnosed	with	a	grapefruit	-	sized	fibroid	.
this	is	a	big	fibroid	.
she	was	offered	a	hysterectomy	,	but	this	is	an	inconceivable	proposition	for	someone	who	wants	to	keep	her	pregnancy	option	.
so	she	elected	to	undergo	a	focused	ultrasound	procedure	in	2008	.
and	in	2010	,	she	became	a	first	-	time	mother	to	a	healthy	baby	.
so	new	life	was	born	.
so	in	conclusion	,	i	'd	like	to	leave	you	with	actually	four	messages	.
one	is	,	think	about	the	amount	of	suffering	that	is	saved	from	patients	undergoing	noninvasive	surgery	,	and	also	the	economical	and	emotional	burden	removed	from	their	families	and	communities	and	the	society	at	large	--	and	i	think	also	from	their	physicians	,	by	the	way	.
and	the	other	thing	i	would	like	you	to	think	about	is	the	new	type	of	relationship	between	physician	and	patients
when	you	have	a	patient	on	the	table	[	who	]	is	awake	and	can	even	monitor	the	treatment	.
in	all	our	treatments	,	the	patient	holds	a	stop	sonication	button	.
he	can	stop	the	surgery	at	any	moment	.
and	with	that	note	,	i	would	like	to	thank	you	for	listening	.
