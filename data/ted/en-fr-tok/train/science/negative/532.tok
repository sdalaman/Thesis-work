we	look	around	the	media	,	as	we	see	on	the	news	from	iraq	,	afghanistan	,	sierra	leone	,	and	the	conflict	seems	incomprehensible	to	us	.
and	that	's	certainly	how	it	seemed	to	me	when	i	started	this	project	.
but	as	a	physicist	,	i	thought	,	well	if	you	give	me	some	data	,	i	could	maybe	understand	this	.	you	know	,	give	us	a	go	.
so	as	a	naive	new	zealander	i	thought	,	well	i	'll	go	to	the	pentagon	.
can	you	get	me	some	information	?
no	.	so	i	had	to	think	a	little	harder	.
and	i	was	watching	the	news	one	night	in	oxford	.
and	i	looked	down	at	the	chattering	heads	on	my	channel	of	choice	.
and	i	saw	that	there	was	information	there	.
there	was	data	within	the	streams	of	news	that	we	consume	.
all	this	noise	around	us	actually	has	information	.
so	what	i	started	thinking	was	,	perhaps	there	is	something	like	open	source	intelligence	here	.
if	we	can	get	enough	of	these	streams	of	information	together	,	we	can	perhaps	start	to	understand	the	war	.
so	this	is	exactly	what	i	did	.	we	started	bringing	a	team	together	,	an	interdisciplinary	team	of	scientists	,	of	economists	,	mathematicians	.
we	brought	these	guys	together	and	we	started	to	try	and	solve	this	.
we	did	it	in	three	steps	.
the	first	step	we	did	was	to	collect	.	we	did	130	different	sources	of	information	--	from	ngo	reports	to	newspapers	and	cable	news	.
we	brought	this	raw	data	in	and	we	filtered	it	.
we	extracted	the	key	bits	on	information	to	build	the	database	.
that	database	contained	the	timing	of	attacks	,	the	location	,	the	size	and	the	weapons	used	.
it	's	all	in	the	streams	of	information	we	consume	daily	,	we	just	have	to	know	how	to	pull	it	out	.
and	once	we	had	this	we	could	start	doing	some	cool	stuff	.
what	if	we	were	to	look	at	the	distribution	of	the	sizes	of	attacks	?
what	would	that	tell	us	?
so	we	started	doing	this	.	and	you	can	see	here	on	the	horizontal	axis	you	've	got	the	number	of	people	killed	in	an	attack	or	the	size	of	the	attack	.
and	on	the	vertical	axis	you	've	got	the	number	of	attacks	.
so	we	plot	data	for	sample	on	this	.
you	see	some	sort	of	random	distribution	--	perhaps	67	attacks	,	one	person	was	killed	,	or	47	attacks	where	seven	people	were	killed	.
we	did	this	exact	same	thing	for	iraq	.
and	we	did	n't	know	,	for	iraq	what	we	were	going	to	find	.
it	turns	out	what	we	found	was	pretty	surprising	.
you	take	all	of	the	conflict	,	all	of	the	chaos	,	all	of	the	noise	,	and	out	of	that	comes	this	precise	mathematical	distribution	of	the	way	attacks	are	ordered	in	this	conflict	.
this	blew	our	mind	.
why	should	a	conflict	like	iraq	have	this	as	its	fundamental	signature	?
why	should	there	be	order	in	war	?
we	did	n't	really	understand	that	.
we	thought	maybe	there	is	something	special	about	iraq	.
so	we	looked	at	a	few	more	conflicts	.
we	looked	at	colombia	,	we	looked	at	afghanistan	,	and	we	looked	at	senegal	.
and	the	same	pattern	emerged	in	each	conflict	.
this	was	n't	supposed	to	happen	.
these	are	different	wars	,	with	different	religious	factions	,	different	political	factions	,	and	different	socioeconomic	problems	.
and	yet	the	fundamental	patterns	underlying	them	are	the	same	.
so	we	went	a	little	wider	.
we	looked	around	the	world	at	all	the	data	we	could	get	our	hands	on	.
from	peru	to	indonesia	,	we	studied	this	same	pattern	again	.
and	we	found	that	not	only	were	the	distributions	these	straight	lines	,	but	the	slope	of	these	lines	,	they	clustered	around	this	value	of	alpha	equals	2.5	.
and	we	could	generate	an	equation	that	could	predict	the	likelihood	of	an	attack	.
what	we	're	saying	here	is	the	probability	of	an	attack	killing	x	number	of	people	in	a	country	like	iraq	is	equal	to	a	constant	,	times	the	size	of	that	attack	,	raised	to	the	power	of	negative	alpha	.
and	negative	alpha	is	the	slope	of	that	line	i	showed	you	before	.
so	what	?
this	is	data	,	statistics	.	what	does	it	tell	us	about	these	conflicts	?
that	was	a	challenge	we	had	to	face	as	physicists	.
how	do	we	explain	this	?
and	what	we	really	found	was	that	alpha	,	if	we	think	about	it	,	is	the	organizational	structure	of	the	insurgency	.
alpha	is	the	distribution	of	the	sizes	of	attacks	,	which	is	really	the	distribution	of	the	group	strength	carrying	out	the	attacks	.
so	we	look	at	a	process	of	group	dynamics	:	coalescence	and	fragmentation	,
groups	coming	together	,	groups	breaking	apart	.
and	we	start	running	the	numbers	on	this	.	can	we	simulate	it	?
can	we	create	the	kind	of	patterns	that	we	're	seeing	in	places	like	iraq	?
turns	out	we	kind	of	do	a	reasonable	job	.
we	can	run	these	simulations	.
we	can	recreate	this	using	a	process	of	group	dynamics	to	explain	the	patterns	that	we	see	all	around	the	conflicts	around	the	world	.
so	what	's	going	on	?
why	should	these	different	--	seemingly	different	conflicts	have	the	same	patterns	?
now	what	i	believe	is	going	on	is	that	the	insurgent	forces	,	they	evolve	over	time	.	they	adapt	.
and	it	turns	out	there	is	only	one	solution	to	fight	a	much	stronger	enemy	.
and	if	you	do	n't	find	that	solution	as	an	insurgent	force	,	you	do	n't	exist	.
so	every	insurgent	force	that	is	ongoing	,	every	conflict	that	is	ongoing	,	it	's	going	to	look	something	like	this	.
and	that	is	what	we	think	is	happening	.
taking	it	forward	,	how	do	we	change	it	?
how	do	we	end	a	war	like	iraq	?
what	does	it	look	like	?
alpha	is	the	structure	.	it	's	got	a	stable	state	at	2.5	.
this	is	what	wars	look	like	when	they	continue	.
we	've	got	to	change	that	.
we	can	push	it	up	:
the	forces	become	more	fragmented	;
there	is	more	of	them	,	but	they	are	weaker	.
or	we	push	it	down	:
they	're	more	robust	;	there	is	less	groups	;
but	perhaps	you	can	sit	and	talk	to	them	.
so	this	graph	here	,	i	'm	going	to	show	you	now	.
no	one	has	seen	this	before	.	this	is	literally	stuff	that	we	've	come	through	last	week	.
and	we	see	the	evolution	of	alpha	through	time	.
we	see	it	start	.	and	we	see	it	grow	up	to	the	stable	state	the	wars	around	the	world	look	like	.
and	it	stays	there	through	the	invasion	of	fallujah	until	the	samarra	bombings	in	the	iraqi	elections	of	'06	.
and	the	system	gets	perturbed	.	it	moves	upwards	to	a	fragmented	state	.
this	is	when	the	surge	happens	.
and	depending	on	who	you	ask	,	the	surge	was	supposed	to	push	it	up	even	further	.
the	opposite	happened	.
the	groups	became	stronger	.
they	became	more	robust	.
and	so	i	'm	thinking	,	right	,	great	,	it	's	going	to	keep	going	down	.
we	can	talk	to	them	.	we	can	get	a	solution	.	the	opposite	happened	.
it	's	moved	up	again	.	the	groups	are	more	fragmented	.
and	this	tells	me	one	of	two	things	.
either	we	're	back	where	we	started	and	the	surge	has	had	no	effect	;
or	finally	the	groups	have	been	fragmented	to	the	extent	that	we	can	start	to	think	about	maybe	moving	out	.
i	do	n't	know	what	the	answer	is	to	that	.
but	i	know	that	we	should	be	looking	at	the	structure	of	the	insurgency	to	answer	that	question	.
thank	you	.
