i	was	thinking	about	my	place	in	the	universe	,	and	about	my	first	thought	about	what	infinity	might	mean	,	when	i	was	a	child	.
and	i	thought	that	if	time	could	reach	forwards	and	backwards	infinitely	,	does	n't	that	mean	that	every	point	in	time	is	really	infinitely	small	,	and	therefore	somewhat	meaningless	.
so	we	do	n't	really	have	a	place	in	the	universe	,	as	far	as	on	a	time	line	.
but	nothing	else	does	either	.
therefore	every	moment	really	is	the	most	important	moment	that	's	ever	happened	,	including	this	moment	right	now	.
and	so	therefore	this	music	you	're	about	to	hear	is	maybe	the	most	important	music	you	'll	ever	hear	in	your	life	.
thank	you	.
for	those	of	you	who	i	'll	be	fortunate	enough	to	meet	afterwards	,	you	could	please	refrain	from	saying	,	``	oh	my	god	,	you	're	so	much	shorter	in	real	life	.	``
because	it	's	like	the	stage	is	an	optical	illusion	,
for	some	reason	.
somewhat	like	the	curving	of	the	universe	.
i	do	n't	know	what	it	is	.	i	get	asked	in	interviews	a	lot	,	``	my	god	,	you	're	guitars	are	so	gigantic	!	``
``	you	must	get	them	custom	made	--	special	,	humongous	guitars	.	``
thank	you	very	much	.
