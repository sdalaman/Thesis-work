good	evening	.
we	are	in	this	wonderful	open	-	air	amphitheater	and	we	are	enjoying	ourselves	in	that	mild	evening	temperature	tonight	,	but	when	qatar	will	host	the	football	world	cup	10	years	from	now	,	2022	,	we	already	heard	it	will	be	in	the	hot	,	very	hot	and	sunny	summer	months	of	june	and	july	.
and	when	qatar	has	been	assigned	to	the	world	cup	all	,	many	people	around	the	world	have	been	wondering	,	how	would	it	be	possible	that	football	players	show	spectacular	football	,	run	around	in	this	desert	climate	?	how	would	it	be	possible	that	spectators	sit	,	enjoy	themselves	in	open	-	air	stadia	in	this	hot	environment	?
together	with	the	architects	of	albert	speer	&	partner	,	our	engineers	from	transsolar	have	been	supporting	,	have	been	developing	open	-	air	stadia	based	on	100	percent	solar	power	,	on	100	percent	solar	cooling	.
let	me	tell	you	about	that	,	but	let	me	start	with	comfort	.
let	me	start	with	the	aspect	of	comfort	,	because	many	people	are	confusing	ambient	temperature	with	thermal	comfort	.
we	are	used	to	looking	at	charts	like	that	,	and	you	see	this	red	line	showing	the	air	temperature	in	june	and	july	,	and	yes	,	that	's	right	,	it	's	picking	up	to	45	degrees	c	.
it	's	actually	very	hot	.
but	air	temperature	is	not	the	full	set	of	climatic	parameters	which	define	comfort	.
let	me	show	you	analysis	a	colleague	of	mine	did	looking	on	different	football	,	world	cups	,	olympic	games	around	the	world	,	looking	on	the	comfort	and	analyzing	the	comfort	people	have	perceived	at	these	different	sport	activities	,	and	let	me	start	with	mexico	.
mexico	temperature	has	been	,	air	temperature	has	been	something	between	15	,	up	to	30	degrees	c	,	and	people	enjoyed	themselves	.
it	was	a	very	comfortable	game	in	mexico	city	.	have	a	look	.
orlando	,	same	kind	of	stadium	,	open	-	air	stadium	.	people	have	been	sitting	in	the	strong	sun	,	in	the	very	high	humidity	in	the	afternoon	,	and	they
did	not	enjoy	.	it	was	not	comfortable	.
the	air	temperature	was	not	too	high	,	but	it	was	not	comfortable	during	these	games	.
what	about	seoul	?	seoul	,	because	of	broadcast	rights	,	all	the	games	have	been	in	the	late
afternoon	.	sun	has	already	been	set	,	so	the	games	have	been	perceived	as	comfortable	.
what	about	athens	?	mediterranean	climate	,	but	in	the	sun	it	was	not	comfortable	.	they	did	n't	perceive	comfort	.
and	we	know	that	from	spain	,	we	know	that	``	sol	y	sombra	.	``
if	you	have	a	ticket	,	and	you	get	a	ticket	for	the	shade	,	you	pay	more	,	because	you	're	in	a	more	comfortable	environment	.
what	about	beijing	?
it	's	again	,	sun	in	the	day	and	high	humidity	,	and	it	was	not	comfortable	.
so	if	i	overlay	,	and	if	you	overlay	all	these	comfort	envelopes	,	what	we	see	is	,	in	all	these	places	,	air	temperature	has	been	ranging	something	from	25	to	35	,	and	if	you	go	on	the	line	,	30	,	of	30	degrees	c	ambient	temperatures	.	if	you	go	along	that	line	you	see	there	has	been	all	kind	of	comfort	,	all	kinds	of	perceived	outdoor	comfort	,	ranging	from	very	comfortable	to	very	uncomfortable	.
so	why	is	that	?
this	is	because	there	are	more	parameters	influencing	our	thermal	comfort	,	which	is	the	sun	,	the	direct	sun	,	the	diffuse	sun	,	which	is	wind	,	strong	wind	,	mild	wind	,	which	is	air	humidity	,	which	is	the	radiant	temperature	of	the	surroundings	where	we	are	in	.
and	this	is	air	temperature	.
all	these	parameters	go	into	the	comfort	feeling	of	our	human	body	,	and	scientists	have	developed	a	parameter	,	which	is	the	perceived	temperature	,	where	all	these	parameters	go	in	and	help	designers	to	understand	which	is	the	driving	parameter	that	i	feel	comfort	or	that	i	do	n't	feel	comfort	.
which	is	the	driving	parameter	which	gives	me	a	perceived	temperature	?	and	these	parameters	,	these	climatic	parameters	are	related	to	the	human	metabolism	.
because	of	our	metabolism	,	we	as	human	beings	,	we	produce	heat	.
i	'm	excited	,	i	'm	talking	to	you	,	i	'm	probably	producing	150	watts	at	the	moment	.	you	are	sitting	,	you	are	relaxed	,	you	're	looking	at	me	.	it	's	probably	100	watts	each	person	is	producing	,	and	we	need	to	get	rid	of	that	energy	.	i	need	,	with	my	body	,	to	get	rid	of	the	energy	,	and	the	harder	it	is	for	myself	,	for	my	body	,	to	get	rid	of	the	energy	,	the	less	comfort	i	feel	.
that	's	it	.	and	if	i	do	n't	get	rid	of	the	energy	,	i	will	die	.
if	we	overlay	what	happens	during	the	football	world	cup	,	what	will	happen	in	june	,	july	,	we	will	see	,	yes	,	air	temperature	will	be	much	higher	,	but	because	the	games	and	the	plays	will	be	in	the	afternoon	,	it	's	probably	the	same	comfort	rating	we	've	found	in	other	places	which	has	perceived	as	non	-	comfortable	.
so	we	sat	together	with	a	team	which	prepared	the	bid	book	,	or	goal	,	that	we	said	,	let	's	aim	for	perceived	temperature	,	for	outdoor	comfort	in	this	range	,	which	is	perceived	with	a	temperature	of	32	degrees	celsius	perceived	temperature	,	which	is	extremely	comfortable	.
people	would	feel	really	fine	in	an	open	outdoor	environment	.
but	what	does	it	mean	?
if	we	just	look	on	what	happens	,	we	see	,	temperature	's	too	high	.
if	we	apply	the	best	architectural	design	,	climate	engineering	design	,	we	wo	n't	get	much	better	.
so	we	need	to	do	something	active	.
we	need	,	for	instance	,	to	bring	in	radiant	cooling	technology	,	and	we	need	to	combine	this	with	so	-	called	soft	conditioning	.
and	how	does	it	look	like	in	a	stadium	?
so	the	stadium	has	a	few	elements	which	create	that
outdoor	comfort	.	first	of	all	,	it	's	shading	.	it	needs	to	protect	where	the	people	are	sitting	against	strong	and	warm	wind	.
but	that	's	not	all	what	we	need
to	do	.	we	need	to	use	active	systems	.
instead	of	blowing	a	hurricane	of	chilled	air	through	the	stadium	,	we	can	use	radiant	cooling	technologies	,	like	a	floor	heating	system	where	water	pipes	are	embedded	in	the	floor	.
and	just	by	using	cold	water	going	through	the	water	pipes	,	you	can	release	the	heat	which	is	absorbed	during	the	day	in	the	stadium	,	so	you	can	create	that	comfort	,	and	then	by	adding	dry	air	instead	of	down	-	chilled	air	,	the	spectators	and	the	football	players	can	adjust	to	their	individual	comfort	needs	,	to	their	individual	energy	balance	.
they	can	adjust	and	find	their	comfort	they	need	to	find	.
there	are	12	stadia	probably	to	come	,	but	there	are	32	training	pitches	where	all	the	individual	countries	are	going	to	train	.
we	applied	the	same	concept	:	shading	of	the	training	pitch	,	using	a	shelter	against	wind	,	then	using	the	grass	.
natural	-	watered	lawn	is	a	very	good	cooling	source	stabilizing	temperature	,	and	using	dehumidified	air	to	create	comfort	.
but	even	the	best	passive	design	would	n't	help	.
we	need	active	system	.
and	how	do	we	do	that	?
our	idea	for	the	bid	was	100	percent	solar	cooling	,	based	on	the	idea	that	we	use	the	roof	of	the	stadia	,	we	cover	the	roofs	of	the	stadia	with	pv	systems	.
we	do	n't	borrow	any	energy	from	history	.
we	are	not	using	fossil	energies	.
we	are	not	borrowing	energy	from	our	neighbors	.
we	're	using	energy	we	can	harvest	on	our	roofs	,	and	also	on	the	training	pitches	,	which	will	be	covered	with	large	,	flexible	membranes	,	and	we	will	see	in	the	next	years	an	industry	coming	up	with	flexible	photovoltaics	,	giving	the	possibilities	of	shading	against	strong	sun	and	producing	electric	energy	in	the	same	time	.
and	this	energy	now	is	harvested	throughout	the	year	,	sent	into	the	grid	,	is	replacing	fossils	in	the	grid	,	and	when	i	need	it	for	the	cooling	,	i	take	it	back	from	the	grid	and	i	use	the	solar	energy	which	i	have	brought	to	the	grid	back	when	i	need	it	for	the	solar	cooling	.
and	i	can	do	that	in	the	first	year	and	i	can	balance	that	in	the	next	10	,	and	the	next	20	years	,	this	energy	,	which	is	necessary	to	condition	a	world	cup	in	qatar	,	the	next	20	years	,	this	energy	goes	into	the	grid	of	qatar	.
so	this	--	thank	you	very	much	.
this	is	not	only	useful	for	stadia	.	we	can	use	that	also	in	open	-	air	places	and	streets	,	and	we	've	been	working	on	the	city	of	the	future	in	masdar	,	which	is	in	the	united	emirates	,	abu	dhabi	.
and	i	had	the	pleasure	to	work	on	the	central	plaza	.
and	the	same	idea	to	use	there	,	to	create	outdoor	conditions	which	are	perceived	as	comfortable	.	people	enjoy	going	there	instead	of	going	into	a	shopping	mall	,	which	is	chilled	down	and	which	is	cooled	.	we	wanted	to	create	an	outdoor	space	which	is	so	comfortable	that	people	can	go	there	in	the	early	afternoon	,	even	in	these	sunny	and	hot	summer	months	,	and	they	can	enjoy	and	meet	there	with	their	families	.
and	the	same	concept	:	shade	against	the	sun	,	shade	against	the	wind	,	and	use	,	use	and	take	advantage	of	the	sun	you	can	harvest	on	your	footprint	.
and	these	beautiful	umbrellas	.
so	i	'd	like	to	encourage	you	to	pay	attention	to	your	thermal	comfort	,	to	your	thermal	environment	,	tonight	and	tomorrow	,	and	if	you	'd	like	to	learn	more	about	that	,	i	invite	you	to	go	to	our	website	.
we	uploaded	a	very	simple	perceived	temperature	calculator	where	you	can	check	out	about	your	outdoor	comfort	.
and	i	also	hope	that	you	share	the	idea	that	if	engineers	and	designers	can	use	all	these	different	climatic	parameters	,	it	will	be	possible	to	create	really	good	and	comfortable	outdoor	conditions	,	to	change	our	thermal	perception	that	we	feel	comfortable	in	an	outdoor	environment	,	and	we	can	do	that	with	the	best	passive	design	,	but	also	using	the	energy	source	of	the	site	in	qatar	which	is	the	sun	.
thank	you	very	much	.
shukran	.
