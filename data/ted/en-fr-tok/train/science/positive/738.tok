i	am	going	to	be	talking	about	secrets	.
obviously	the	best	way	to	divulge	a	secret	is	to	tell	someone	to	not	say	anything	about	it	.
secrets	.	i	'm	using	powerpoint	this	year	just	because	,	you	know	,	i	'm	into	the	ted	thing	.
and	when	you	use	these	things	you	do	n't	have	to	go	like	that	.
you	just	press	it	.
oh	,	man	.	um	,	yes	.
yes	.	i	'm	sure	!	just	change	it	!
is	bill	gates	here	?
change	it	!	come	on	!	what	?
ah	!	okay	.
that	's	not	my	slides	,	but	it	's	okay	.
as	you	can	see	,	these	are	all	maps	.
and	maps	are	important	devices	for	transferring	information	,	especially	if	you	have	human	cognitive	ability	.
we	can	see	that	all	formulas	are	really	maps	.
now	,	as	humans	,	we	make	maps	of	places	that	we	seldom	even	go	,
which	seems	a	little	wasteful	of	time	.
this	,	of	course	,	is	a	map	of	the	moon	.
there	're	some	very	delightful	names	.
tranquilacalitis	,	[	unclear	]	.	my	favorite	is	frigoris	.
what	are	these	people	thinking	?	frigoris	?
what	the	frigoris	you	doing	?	names	are	important	.
frigoris	?	this	is	the	moon	.	people	could	live	there	one	day	.
i	'll	meet	you	at	frigoris	.	no	.	i	do	n't	think	so	.
there	we	see	mars	,	again	with	various	names	.
and	this	is	all	done	,	by	the	way	,	by	the	international	astronomical	union	.
this	is	an	actual	group	of	people	that	sit	around	naming	planetary	objects	.
this	is	from	their	actual	book	.
these	are	some	of	the	names	that	they	have	chosen	,	ladies	and	gentlemen	.
i	'll	go	through	a	little	of	them	.	bolotnitsa	.
that	,	of	course	,	is	the	slavic	swamp	mermaid	.
now	i	think	the	whole	concept	of	a	mermaid	does	n't	really	blend	into	the	swamp	feel	.
``	oh	look	!	mermaid	come	out	of	swamp	.	oh	boy	!
it	's	time	for	bolotnitsa	!	``	djabran	fluctus	.
if	that	do	n't	flow	off	the	tongue	,	what	does	?
i	mean	kids	are	studying	this	stuff	and	they	've	got	the	word	``	fluctus	``	up	there	.	that	's	wrong	.
one	dyslexic	kid	and	he	could	be	ruining	his	life	.
``	it	fluctus	up	,	mama	.	``
hikuleo	fluctus	.
that	's	a	little	more	flowing	.	hikuleo	sounds	like	a	kind	of	a	leonardo	dicaprio	17	syllable	thing	.
and	that	's	the	tonga	underworld	.
and	one	of	my	favorites	is	the	itoki	fluctus	,	who	is	the	nicaraguan	goddess	of	insects	,	stars	,	and	planets	.
now	,	if	you	're	a	goddess	of	stars	and	planets	would	n't	you	relegate	insects	to	somebody	else	?
``	no	,	no	,	really	,	i	'm	so	busy	with	the	stars	.
would	you	mind	taking	the	insects	?	thank	you	darling	.
oh	take	the	spiders	too	.	i	know	they	're	not	insects	,	but	i	do	n't	care	.
monkeys	,	chimps	,	just	get	rid	of	the	hairy	creatures	.	``	now	,	we	're	going	to	be	going	to	mars	one	day	.	and	when	we	do	,	it	's	going	to	be	unfair	for	the	people	that	are	living	there	to	have	to	live	with	these	ridiculous	names	.
so	,	you	'll	be	on	mars	,	and	you	're	at	hellespointica	depressio	which	has	got	to	be	a	really	``	up	``	place	.
yeah	,	i	'm	at	the	depressio	,	and	i	want	to	get	over	to	amazonis	so	i	plug	it	into	the	mars	map	,	and	click	the	button	and	there	's	my	directions	.
i	go	to	chrysokeras	.
left	to	the	thymiamata	.
then	to	niliacus	lacus	,	which	is	not	a	bad	name	.
niliacus	lacus	,	try	to	get	the	practice	,	slick	-	a	-	tick	-	a	-	bacus	.
that	's	a	cool	name	.	i	will	say	that	.
so	,	i	hold	back	a	little	of	my	venom	for	these	astronomical	misnomers	.
and	then	of	course	arnon	to	thoth	.
and	of	course	there	will	be	advertisements	.
this	is	from	their	rule	book	,	the	international	astronomical	union	.
and	you	know	they	're	international	because	they	put	it	``	en	francais	``	as	well	.
l'union	astronomique	internationale	,	for	those	of	you	who	do	n't	speak	french	.
i	thought	i	'd	translate	for	you	.
from	the	rulebook	:	nomenclature	is	a	tool	.
the	first	consideration	,	make	it	clear	,	simple	and	unambiguous	.
and	i	think	that	djabran	fluctus	,	that	fits	that	mode	.
that	's	simple	,	the	goddess	of	goats	,	very	simple	.
djabran	fluctus	.
``	now	,	frank	is	this	clear	to	you	,	djabran	fluctus	?	``
``	yeah	,	that	's	the	goat	goddess	right	?	the	abacazanian	?
it	's	clear	to	me	.	``
``	listen	,	i	'm	going	back	to	the	swamp	mermaid	.	can	you	call	me	in	a	little	while	?	``
also	,	from	the	actual	document	i	highlighted	a	part	i	thought	may	be	of	interest	.
anyone	can	suggest	changing	a	name	.
so	,	i	look	to	you	,	fellow	member	of	the	earth	community	.
we	've	got	to	change	this	stuff	up	fast	.
so	,	these	are	actual	names	of	people	that	work	there	.
i	did	some	more	investigation	.
these	are	more	people	working	for	this	group	.
and	,	as	you	can	see	,	they	do	n't	use	their	first	names	.
these	are	people	naming	planets	,	and	they	wo	n't	use	their	first	names	.
something	is	askew	here	.
is	it	because	his	name	is	really	jupiter	blunck	?
is	that	ganymede	andromeda	burba	?
is	that	mars	ya	marov	?
i	do	n't	know	.	but	it	's	investigative	material	,	no	doubt	.
there	are	some	mapping	people	who	do	use	their	names	.
witness	please	,	eugene	shoemaker	,	who	,	diligently	,	from	a	young	boy	decided	he	wanted	to	make	maps	of	celestial	bodies	.
must	have	been	a	very	interesting	day	in	the	shoemaker	house	.
``	mom	,	i	want	to	make	maps	.	``
``	that	's	wonderful	eugene	.	you	could	make	maps	of	toronto	.	``
``	no	,	i	want	to	make	maps	of	planets	.	``
``	yeah	,	go	to	your	room	.	``
martians	,	venusians	,	jovians	.
we	have	names	for	places	where	people	do	n't	exist	.
that	seems	a	little	silly	to	me	.
there	are	no	jovians	.
getting	back	to	my	premise	,	i	used	stamps	,	by	the	way	,	because	you	do	n't	have	to	pay	anybody	for	the	rights	.
there	is	obviously	einstein	,	niels	bohr	,	de	fermat	's	last	theorem	,	and	i	'm	not	sure	whether	that	's	james	coburn	or	richard	harris	.
it	's	definitely	one	of	the	two	.	i	'm	not	really	clear	which	one	.
but	obviously	the	point	is	that	numbers	are	maps	.
and	within	numbers	,	is	there	an	underlying	secret	to	the	universe	?
that	is	the	premise	of	this	particular	presentation	.
by	the	way	,	that	's	a	natural	picture	of	saturn	,	no	adjustments	.	i	mean	that	's	just	beautiful	.
so	beautiful	that	i	will	even	give	up	a	laugh	to	explain	my	love	of	this	particular	planet	,	and	the	day	saturday	,	named	after	it	,	wonderfully	.
so	,	formulas	relate	number	to	form	.
that	's	euler	,	his	formula	was	one	of	the	inspirations	that	lead	to	the	beginning	of	string	theory	which	is	kind	of	cool	,	not	that	funny	,	but	it	is	cool	.
he	was	also	famous	for	having	no	body	.
which	a	lot	of	you	are	like	,	``	how	did	he	figure	that	out	?	``
he	's	got	no	body	,	no	man	,	just	a	head	floating	high	.
here	comes	euler	.
and	that	's	an	icosahedron	,	which	is	one	of	the	five	sacred	solids	,	very	important	shapes	.
you	see	the	icosahedron	again	.
the	dodecahedron	,	it	's	dual	.
there	is	a	dodecahedron	which	i	had	to	do	in	my	room	last	night	.
the	five	sacred	solids	,	as	you	can	see	there	.
which	is	not	to	be	confused	with	the	five	sacred	salads	.
blue	cheese	,	ranch	,	oil	and	vinegar	,	thousand	islands	and	house	.
i	suggest	the	house	.
the	reality	,	now	here	is	something	important	.
what	's	important	about	this	is	these	shapes	are	duals	of	each	other	.
and	you	can	see	how	the	icosahedron	withdraws	into	the	dodecahedron	and	then	they	just	merge	into	each	other	.
so	,	the	whole	concept	of	branes	in	the	universe	,	if	the	universe	is	shaped	like	a	dodecahedron	this	is	a	very	good	map	of	what	could	possibly	be	.
and	that	is	,	of	course	,	what	we	are	here	to	talk	about	.
what	a	coincidence	!
october	9th	,	in	france	,	jean	-	pierre	luminet	said	that	the	universe	is	probably	shaped	like	a	dodecahedron	,	based	on	information	that	they	got	from	this	probe	.
this	would	be	a	normal	wave	pattern	.
but	what	they	're	seeing	,	way	out	there	in	the	far	reaches	of	the	microwave	background	,	is	this	kind	of	odd	undulation	.
it	does	n't	plug	in	to	what	they	suspected	a	flat	universe	would	be	.
so	,	you	can	kind	of	get	an	idea	from	this	extrapolating	that	back	under	this	huge	picture	,	so	we	get	this	idea	of	what	the	primal	universe	looked	like	.
and	judging	from	this	,	it	looks	a	little	like	a	cheeseburger	.
so	,	i	'm	thinking	the	universe	is	either	a	dodecahedron	or	a	cheeseburger	.
and	for	me	,	that	's	a	win	-	win	.
everybody	goes	,	i	'm	happy	.
better	really	hurry	up	.
i	just	threw	this	in	because	as	important	as	all	of	our	intellectual	abilities	are	,	without	heart	and	without	love	it	's	just	--	it	's	all	meaningless	.	and	that	,	to	me	,	is	really	beautiful	.
except	for	that	creepy	guy	in	the	background	.
getting	back	to	the	point	of	my	particular	presentation	,	kepler	,	one	of	my	great	heroes	,	who	realized	that	these	five	solids	,	which	i	spoke	of	earlier	,	were	related	somehow	to	the	planets	,	but	he	could	n't	prove	it	.	it	freaked	him	out	.
but	it	did	lead	to	newton	discovering	gravity	.
so	,	maps	of	things	leading	to	organized	understandings	of	the	universe	in	which	we	emerge	.	now	this	is	isaac	from	a	vietnamese	stamp	.
i	am	not	suggesting	at	all	that	my	vietnamese	brothers	and	sisters	could	maybe	use	a	little	art	class	here	and	there	.	but	...
that	's	not	a	good	picture	.
not	a	good	picture	.	now	,	my	friends	in	the	island	of	nevis	are	a	little	better	.	look	at	that	!	that	's	isaac	newton	.
that	guy	is	rockin	'	.
what	a	handsome	cat	.
once	again	,	nicaragua	let	me	down	.
and	copernicus	looks	like	johnny	carson	,	which	is	really	weird	.
i	do	n't	get	that	at	all	.
once	again	,	these	guys	rock	it	out	.
isaac	is	kickin	'	ass	.	man	,	he	looks	like	a	rock	star	.
this	is	freaky	is	a	major	way	.
this	is	sierra	leone	.
they	got	little	babies	in	there	,	floating	in	there	.
man	.	i	do	n't	really	need	to	comment	on	this	.	but	i	did	n't	know	that	isaac	newton	was	in	the	moody	blues	.	did	you	?
when	did	this	happen	?
it	's	a	different	kind	of	course	.	and	they	've	got	five	apples	?
i	mean	these	guys	are	extrapolating	in	realms	that	are	not	necessarily	valid	.
although	five	is	a	good	number	,	of	course	.
ecuador	,	my	friend	kepler	,	as	you	can	see	,	they	call	him	juan	.
juan	?	no	!	johannes	,	not	juan	.
it	was	n't	carlos	chaplain	.	it	's	wrong	.
ren√©	descartes	,	of	course	.	once	again	these	grenada	people	,	this	is	like	way	too	sick	for	anybody	's	imagination	.
he	's	all	murky	.	there	is	little	kids	leaning	on	his	leg	,	little	ghosts	flying	around	.	we	got	ta	clean	this	stuff	up	fast	,	ladies	and	gentlemen	.
this	is	,	of	course	,	the	cartesian	coordinates	.
once	again	,	that	's	sierra	leone	.
this	is	again	,	indicating	how	numbers	relate	to	space	relate	to	form	,	maps	of	the	universe	.
because	that	's	why	we	're	here	,	really	,	i	think	to	figure	stuff	out	and	to	love	each	other	.
descartes	.
before	the	horse	.
now	,	monaco	took	descartes	,	and	just	flipped	him	around	.
now	,	monaco	is	problematic	for	me	,	and	i	'll	show	you	why	.
here	is	a	map	.	all	they	have	is	a	casino	on	it	.
and	why	franklin	delano	roosevelt	is	on	their	map	i	do	n't	even	want	to	hazard	a	guess	.
but	i	'd	say	he	'd	been	to	hellespointica	depressio	recently	.
this	is	the	flag	of	monaco	.	ladies	and	gentlemen	,	the	flag	of	indonesia	.	please	examine	.
not	sure	how	this	came	to	be	,	but	it	's	not	right	.
in	monaco	,	``	no	,	what	are	you	talking	about	?
they	are	so	different	.
look	,	ours	is	more	red	,	it	's	longer	.
they	stole	our	flag	!	they	stole	our	flag	!	``	bode	's	law	was	n't	even	his	law	.	it	was	a	guy	named	titus	.
and	the	reason	i	just	bring	this	up	because	it	is	a	law	that	does	n't	really	work	.
that	's	jude	law	and	some	of	his	films	recently	did	n't	work	.
just	a	correlation	that	indicates	how	things	are	misinterpreted	.
and	i	wonder	if	the	photographer	said	,	``	okay	,	jude	,	could	you	touch	your	tooth	?	that	's	good	.	``	just	a	tip	,	if	you	're	being	photographed	for	press	pictures	,	do	n't	touch	your	teeth	.
prime	numbers	,	gauss	,	one	of	my	favorites	.
golden	section	,	i	've	been	obsessed	with	this	thing	since	before	i	was	born	.
i	know	that	scares	a	lot	of	you	,	but	that	was	my	purpose	entirely	.
there	we	can	see	fibonacci	numbers	related	to	the	golden	section	,	because	fibonacci	and	golden	section	relate	to	the	unfolding	of	the	measured	meter	of	matter	,	as	i	refer	to	it	.
if	fibonacci	had	been	on	paxil	,	that	would	be	the	fibonacci	series	.
``	ten	milligram	,	20	milligram	.	``
``	leonardo	,	dinner	's	ready	,	put	down	those	books	and	take	your	pills	.	``
``	yes	,	mama	.	``
alright	where	is	this	going	?	that	's	a	good	question	.
here	is	the	premise	that	i	began	27	years	ago	.
if	numbers	can	express	the	laws	of	this	incredible	universe	that	we	live	,	i	reason	,	through	some	sort	of	reverse	engineering	,	we	could	extrapolate	from	them	some	basic	structural	element	of	this	universe	.
and	that	's	what	i	did	.	twenty	-	seven	years	ago	i	started	working	on	this	.
and	i	tried	to	build	a	particle	accelerator	.
and	that	did	n't	work	out	well	.
so	,	then	i	thought	a	calculator	is	a	metaphor	.
i	can	just	divide	numbers	,	that	's	like	atom	smashing	.
that	's	what	i	did	.	that	's	how	i	found	moleeds	.
moleeds	are	what	i	believe	the	thing	that	will	allow	string	theory	to	be	proved	.
they	are	the	nodes	on	the	string	,	patterns	and	relationships	,	27	,	37	.
that	was	the	first	chart	i	came	up	with	.
you	can	see	,	even	if	you	do	n't	go	for	the	numbers	,	the	beauty	of	the	symmetry	.
the	numbers	from	one	to	36	,	divided	into	six	groups	.
symmetry	,	pairs	.
every	top	adds	up	to	37	.
bottom	,	all	74	.
there	is	so	many	intricate	relationships	that	i	'm	not	going	to	go	there	now	,	because	you	would	say	,	``	hey	,	go	back	to	the	fluctus	part	.	``
circle	of	fifths	,	acoustic	harmony	,	geometric	symmetry	.
i	knew	those	two	were	related	.
once	again	,	the	cartesian	kind	of	cross	-	over	.
so	,	i	said	if	i	'm	going	to	put	a	circle	,	see	what	kind	of	patterns	i	get	,	boom	,	the	red	system	.
look	at	that	.	you	ca	n't	just	make	this	stuff	up	,	ladies	and	gentlemen	.
you	ca	n't	just	go	around	going	,	``	oh	,	i	'm	going	to	put	some	triangles	in	a	circle	and	they	're	going	to	be	symmetrical	.	and	they	're	all	going	to	add	up	,	and	it	's	going	to	be	,	oh	yeah	,	i	figured	that	out	.	``
this	is	beyond	anything	anybody	could	just	make	up	.
there	is	the	orange	system	.
and	you	'll	see	over	here	,	these	are	multiples	of	the	number	27	.
and	they	recapitulate	that	shape	,	even	though	that	's	a	circle	of	nine	and	that	's	a	circle	of	36.	it	's	nuts	.
that	's	the	green	system	.	it	all	folds	in	half	on	the	green	system	,	right	between	18	and	19	.
the	blue	system	.	the	violet	.	it	's	all	there	.
look	at	that	!	i	mean	you	can	not	make	that	stuff	up	.
that	just	does	n't	fall	out	of	a	tree	,	ladies	and	gentlemen	.
twenty	-	seven	years	of	my	life	!
and	i	'm	presenting	it	here	at	ted	.	why	?
because	this	is	the	place	if	aliens	land	,	i	hope	they	come	here	.
``	we	are	going	to	destroy	the	earth	.	hmmm	...	maybe	not	.	``
in	this	last	year	i	have	found	these	subsequent	systems	which	allow	for	the	mathematic	possibilities	of	the	calabi	-	yau	manifolds	in	a	way	that	does	n't	necessitate	these	little	hidden	dimensions	.
which	works	mathematically	,	but	it	just	does	n't	seem	god	-	like	to	me	.
it	just	seems	like	it	's	not	sexy	and	elegant	,	it	's	hidden	.
i	do	n't	want	hidden	,	i	want	to	see	it	.
i	found	other	pairs	all	have	symmetry	,	even	though	,	unlike	the	master	one	,	their	symmetry	is	split	.
unbelievable	.	this	is	like	crazy	.
am	i	the	only	one	that	sees	this	?
you	know	,	i	did	n't	just	draw	this	in	a	day	,	by	the	way	.
you	know	,	try	making	some	charts	like	this	at	home	.
you	got	ta	be	accurate	!	there	's	measurement	involved	,	increments	.
these	are	maps	,	by	the	way	.
not	stamps	,	but	one	day	.
okay	,	i	'm	getting	to	the	punch	.	golden	ratio	,	it	's	crazy	.
and	look	at	this	,	built	within	it	is	the	golden	ratio	.
i	start	looking	at	that	,	and	look	at	them	again	.
they	start	looking	like	planets	.
i	go	to	jpl	.
i	look	at	the	orbits	of	the	planets	.
i	find	18	examples	of	it	in	our	solar	system	.
i	never	told	anybody	.	this	is	the	first	thing	.	this	could	be	history	.
kepler	was	right	.
eighteen	and	19	,	the	middle	of	the	moleeds	,	0.618	is	the	golden	section	.	multiply	them	together	,	18.618	x	19.618	is	365.247	.
which	is	.005	different	from	the	number	of	days	in	a	year	.
hey	,	you	ca	n't	make	this	up	.
thank	you	very	much	.
thank	you	.
thank	you	.
