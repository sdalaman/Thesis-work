the	world	is	changing	with	really	remarkable	speed	.
if	you	look	at	the	chart	at	the	top	here	,	you	'll	see	that	in	2025	,	these	goldman	sachs	projections	suggest	that	the	chinese	economy	will	be	almost	the	same	size	as	the	american	economy	.
and	if	you	look	at	the	chart	for	2050	,	it	's	projected	that	the	chinese	economy	will	be	twice	the	size	of	the	american	economy	,	and	the	indian	economy	will	be	almost	the	same	size	as	the	american	economy	.
and	we	should	bear	in	mind	here	that	these	projections	were	drawn	up	before	the	western	financial	crisis	.
a	couple	of	weeks	ago	,	i	was	looking	at	the	latest	projection	by	bnp	paribas	for	when	china	will	have	a	larger	economy	than	the	united	states	.
goldman	sachs	projected	2027	.
the	post	-	crisis	projection	is	2020	.
that	's	just	a	decade	away	.
china	is	going	to	change	the	world	in	two	fundamental	respects	.
first	of	all	,	it	's	a	huge	developing	country	with	a	population	of	1.3	billion	people	,	which	has	been	growing	for	over	30	years	at	around	10	percent	a	year	.
and	within	a	decade	,	it	will	have	the	largest	economy	in	the	world	.
never	before	in	the	modern	era	has	the	largest	economy	in	the	world	been	that	of	a	developing	country	,	rather	than	a	developed	country	.
secondly	,	for	the	first	time	in	the	modern	era	,	the	dominant	country	in	the	world	--	which	i	think	is	what	china	will	become	--	will	be	not	from	the	west	and	from	very	,	very	different	civilizational	roots	.
now	,	i	know	it	's	a	widespread	assumption	in	the	west	that	as	countries	modernize	,	they	also	westernize	.
this	is	an	illusion	.
it	's	an	assumption	that	modernity	is	a	product	simply	of	competition	,	markets	and	technology	.
it	is	not	.	it	is	also	shaped	equally	by	history	and	culture	.
china	is	not	like	the	west	,	and	it	will	not	become	like	the	west	.
it	will	remain	in	very	fundamental	respects	very	different	.
now	the	big	question	here	is	obviously	,	how	do	we	make	sense	of	china	?
how	do	we	try	to	understand	what	china	is	?
and	the	problem	we	have	in	the	west	at	the	moment	,	by	and	large	,	is	that	the	conventional	approach	is	that	we	understand	it	really	in	western	terms	,	using	western	ideas	.
we	ca	n't	.
now	i	want	to	offer	you	three	building	blocks	for	trying	to	understand	what	china	is	like	,	just	as	a	beginning	.
the	first	is	this	:	that	china	is	not	really	a	nation	-	state	.
okay	,	it	's	called	itself	a	nation	-	state	for	the	last	hundred	years	,	but	everyone	who	knows	anything	about	china	knows	it	's	a	lot	older	than	this	.
this	was	what	china	looked	like	with	the	victory	of	the	qin	dynasty	in	221	b.c	.	at	the	end	of	the	warring	-	state	period	--
the	birth	of	modern	china	.
and	you	can	see	it	against	the	boundaries	of	modern	china	.
or	immediately	afterward	,	the	han	dynasty	,	still	2,000	years	ago	.
and	you	can	see	already	it	occupies	most	of	what	we	now	know	as	eastern	china	,	which	is	where	the	vast	majority	of	chinese	lived	then	and	live	now	.
now	what	is	extraordinary	about	this	is	,	what	gives	china	its	sense	of	being	china	,	what	gives	the	chinese	the	sense	of	what	it	is	to	be	chinese	,	comes	not	from	the	last	hundred	years	,	not	from	the	nation	-	state	period	,	which	is	what	happened	in	the	west	,	but	from	the	period	,	if	you	like	,	of	the	civilization	-	state	.
i	'm	thinking	here	,	for	example	,	of	customs	like	ancestral	worship	,	of	a	very	distinctive	notion	of	the	state	,	likewise	,	a	very	distinctive	notion	of	the	family	,	social	relationships	like	guanxi	,	confucian	values	and	so	on	.
these	are	all	things	that	come	from	the	period	of	the	civilization	-	state	.
in	other	words	,	china	,	unlike	the	western	states	and	most	countries	in	the	world	,	is	shaped	by	its	sense	of	civilization	,	its	existence	as	a	civilization	-	state	,	rather	than	as	a	nation	-	state	.
and	there	's	one	other	thing	to	add	to	this	,	and	that	is	this	:	of	course	we	know	china	's	big	,	huge	,	demographically	and	geographically	,	with	a	population	of	1.3	billion	people	.
what	we	often	are	n't	really	aware	of	is	the	fact	that	china	is	extremely	diverse	and	very	pluralistic	,	and	in	many	ways	very	decentralized	.
you	ca	n't	run	a	place	on	this	scale	simply	from	beijing	,	even	though	we	think	this	to	be	the	case	.
it	's	never	been	the	case	.
so	this	is	china	,	a	civilization	-	state	,	rather	than	a	nation	-	state	.
and	what	does	it	mean	?
well	,	i	think	it	has	all	sorts	of	profound	implications	.
i	'll	give	you	two	quick	ones	.
the	first	is	that	the	most	important	political	value	for	the	chinese	is	unity	,	is	the	maintenance	of	chinese	civilization	.
you	know	,	2,000	years	ago	,	europe	:	breakdown	--	the	fragmentation	of	the	holy	roman	empire	.
it	divided	,	and	it	's	remained	divided	ever	since	.
china	,	over	the	same	time	period	,	went	in	exactly	the	opposite	direction	,	very	painfully	holding	this	huge	civilization	,	civilization	-	state	,	together	.
the	second	is	maybe	more	prosaic	,	which	is	hong	kong	.
do	you	remember	the	handover	of	hong	kong	by	britain	to	china	in	1997	?
you	may	remember	what	the	chinese	constitutional	proposition	was	.	one	country	,	two	systems	.
and	i	'll	lay	a	wager	that	barely	anyone	in	the	west	believed	them	.
``	window	dressing	.
when	china	gets	its	hands	on	hong	kong	,	that	wo	n't	be	the	case	.	``	thirteen	years	on	,	the	political	and	legal	system	in	hong	kong	is	as	different	now	as	it	was	in	1997	.
we	were	wrong	.	why	were	we	wrong	?
we	were	wrong	because	we	thought	,	naturally	enough	,	in	nation	-	state	ways	.
think	of	german	unification	,	1990	.
what	happened	?
well	,	basically	the	east	was	swallowed	by	the	west	.
one	nation	,	one	system	.
that	is	the	nation	-	state	mentality	.
but	you	ca	n't	run	a	country	like	china	,	a	civilization	-	state	,	on	the	basis	of	one	civilization	,	one	system	.
it	does	n't	work	.
so	actually	the	response	of	china	to	the	question	of	hong	kong	--	as	it	will	be	to	the	question	of	taiwan	--	was	a	natural	response	:	one	civilization	,	many	systems	.
let	me	offer	you	another	building	block	to	try	and	understand	china	--	maybe	not	sort	of	a	comfortable	one	.
the	chinese	have	a	very	,	very	different	conception	of	race	to	most	other	countries	.
do	you	know	,	of	the	1.3	billion	chinese	,	over	90	percent	of	them	think	they	belong	to	the	same	race	,	the	han	?
now	,	this	is	completely	different	from	the	world	's	[	other	]	most	populous	countries	.
india	,	the	united	states	,	indonesia	,	brazil	--	all	of	them	are	multiracial	.
the	chinese	do	n't	feel	like	that	.
china	is	only	multiracial	really	at	the	margins	.
so	the	question	is	,	why	?
well	the	reason	,	i	think	,	essentially	is	,	again	,	back	to	the	civilization	-	state	.
a	history	of	at	least	2,000	years	,	a	history	of	conquest	,	occupation	,	absorption	,	assimilation	and	so	on	,
led	to	the	process	by	which	,	over	time	,	this	notion	of	the	han	emerged	--	of	course	,	nurtured	by	a	growing	and	very	powerful	sense	of	cultural	identity	.
now	the	great	advantage	of	this	historical	experience	has	been	that	,	without	the	han	,	china	could	never	have	held	together	.
the	han	identity	has	been	the	cement	which	has	held	this	country	together	.
the	great	disadvantage	of	it	is	that	the	han	have	a	very	weak	conception	of	cultural	difference	.
they	really	believe	in	their	own	superiority	,	and	they	are	disrespectful	of	those	who	are	not	.
hence	their	attitude	,	for	example	,	to	the	uyghurs	and	to	the	tibetans	.
or	let	me	give	you	my	third	building	block	,	the	chinese	state	.
now	the	relationship	between	the	state	and	society	in	china	is	very	different	from	that	in	the	west	.
now	we	in	the	west	overwhelmingly	seem	to	think	--	in	these	days	at	least	--	that	the	authority	and	legitimacy	of	the	state	is	a	function	of	democracy	.
the	problem	with	this	proposition	is	that	the	chinese	state	enjoys	more	legitimacy	and	more	authority	amongst	the	chinese	than	is	true	with	any	western	state	.
and	the	reason	for	this	is	because	--
well	,	there	are	two	reasons	,	i	think	.
and	it	's	obviously	got	nothing	to	do	with	democracy	,	because	in	our	terms	the	chinese	certainly	do	n't	have	a	democracy	.
and	the	reason	for	this	is	,	firstly	,	because	the	state	in	china	is	given	a	very	special	--	it	enjoys	a	very	special	significance	as	the	representative	,	the	embodiment	and	the	guardian	of	chinese	civilization	,	of	the	civilization	-	state	.
this	is	as	close	as	china	gets	to	a	kind	of	spiritual	role	.
and	the	second	reason	is	because	,	whereas	in	europe	and	north	america	,	the	state	's	power	is	continuously	challenged	--	i	mean	in	the	european	tradition	,	historically	against	the	church	,	against	other	sectors	of	the	aristocracy	,	against	merchants	and	so	on	--	for	1,000	years	,	the	power	of	the	chinese	state	has	not	been	challenged	.
it	's	had	no	serious	rivals	.
so	you	can	see	that	the	way	in	which	power	has	been	constructed	in	china	is	very	different	from	our	experience	in	western	history	.
the	result	,	by	the	way	,	is	that	the	chinese	have	a	very	different	view	of	the	state	.
whereas	we	tend	to	view	it	as	an	intruder	,	a	stranger	,	certainly	an	organ	whose	powers	need	to	be	limited	or	defined	and	constrained	,	the	chinese	do	n't	see	the	state	like	that	at	all	.
the	chinese	view	the	state	as	an	intimate	--	not	just	as	an	intimate	actually	,	as	a	member	of	the	family	--	not	just	in	fact	as	a	member	of	the	family	,	but	as	the	head	of	the	family	,	the	patriarch	of	the	family	.
this	is	the	chinese	view	of	the	state	--	very	,	very	different	to	ours	.
it	's	embedded	in	society	in	a	different	kind	of	way	to	what	is	the	case	in	the	west	.
and	i	would	suggest	to	you	that	actually	what	we	are	dealing	with	here	,	in	the	chinese	context	,	is	a	new	kind	of	paradigm	,	which	is	different	from	anything	we	've	had	to	think	about	in	the	past	.
know	that	china	believes	in	the	market	and	the	state	.
i	mean	,	adam	smith	,	already	writing	in	the	late	18th	century	,	said	,	``	the	chinese	market	is	larger	and	more	developed	and	more	sophisticated	than	anything	in	europe	.	``	and	,	apart	from	the	mao	period	,	that	has	remained	more	or	less	the	case	ever	since	.
but	this	is	combined	with	an	extremely	strong	and	ubiquitous	state	.
the	state	is	everywhere	in	china	.	i	mean	,	it	's	leading	firms	--	many	of	them	are	still	publicly	owned	.	private	firms	,	however	large	they	are	,	like	lenovo	,	depend	in	many	ways	on	state	patronage	.	targets	for	the	economy	and	so	on
are	set	by	the	state	.
and	the	state	,	of	course	,	its	authority	flows	into	lots	of	other	areas	--
as	we	are	familiar	with	--	with	something	like	the	one	-	child	policy	.
moreover	,	this	is	a	very	old	state	tradition	,	a	very	old	tradition	of	statecraft	.
i	mean	,	if	you	want	an	illustration	of	this	,	the	great	wall	is	one	.
but	this	is	another	,	this	is	the	grand	canal	,	which	was	constructed	in	the	first	instance	in	the	fifth	century	b.c	.
and	was	finally	completed	in	the	seventh	century	a.d	.
it	went	for	1,114	miles	,	linking	beijing	with	hangzhou	and	shanghai	.
so	there	's	a	long	history	of	extraordinary	state	infrastructural	projects	in	china	,	which	i	suppose	helps	us	to	explain	what	we	see	today	,	which	is	something	like	the	three	gorges	dam	and	many	other	expressions	of	state	competence	within	china	.
so	there	we	have	three	building	blocks	for	trying	to	understand	the	difference	that	is	china	--	the	civilization	-	state	,	the	notion	of	race	and	the	nature	of	the	state	and	its	relationship	to	society	.
and	yet	we	still	insist	,	by	and	large	,	in	thinking	that	we	can	understand	china	by	simply	drawing	on	western	experience	,	looking	at	it	through	western	eyes	,	using	western	concepts	.
if	you	want	to	know	why	we	unerringly	seem	to	get	china	wrong	--	our	predictions	about	what	's	going	to	happen	to	china	are	incorrect	--	this	is	the	reason	.
unfortunately	,	i	think	,	i	have	to	say	that	i	think	attitude	towards	china	is	that	of	a	kind	of	little	westerner	mentality	.
it	's	kind	of	arrogant	.
it	's	arrogant	in	the	sense	that	we	think	that	we	are	best	,	and	therefore	we	have	the	universal	measure	.
and	secondly	,	it	's	ignorant	.
we	refuse	to	really	address	the	issue	of	difference	.
you	know	,	there	's	a	very	interesting	passage	in	a	book	by	paul	cohen	,	the	american	historian	.
and	paul	cohen	argues	that	the	west	thinks	of	itself	as	probably	the	most	cosmopolitan	of	all	cultures	.
but	it	's	not	.
in	many	ways	,	it	's	the	most	parochial	,	because	for	200	years	,	the	west	has	been	so	dominant	in	the	world	that	it	's	not	really	needed	to	understand	other	cultures	,	other	civilizations	.
because	,	at	the	end	of	the	day	,	it	could	,	if	necessary	by	force	,	get	its	own	way	.
whereas	those	cultures	--	virtually	the	rest	of	the	world	,	in	fact	,	which	have	been	in	a	far	weaker	position	,	vis	-	a	-	vis	the	west	--	have	been	thereby	forced	to	understand	the	west	,	because	of	the	west	's	presence	in	those	societies	.
and	therefore	,	they	are	,	as	a	result	,	more	cosmopolitan	in	many	ways	than	the	west	.
i	mean	,	take	the	question	of	east	asia	.	east	asia	:	japan	,	korea	,	china	,	etc	.	--	a	third	of	the	world	's	population	lives	there	.	now	the	largest	economic	region	in	the	world	.
and	i	'll	tell	you	now	,	that	east	asianers	,	people	from	east	asia	,	are	far	more	knowledgeable	about	the	west	than	the	west	is	about	east	asia	.
now	this	point	is	very	germane	,	i	'm	afraid	,	to	the	present	.
because	what	's	happening	?	back	to	that	chart	at	the	beginning	,	the	goldman	sachs	chart	.
what	is	happening	is	that	,	very	rapidly	in	historical	terms	,	the	world	is	being	driven	and	shaped	,	not	by	the	old	developed	countries	,	but	by	the	developing	world	.
we	've	seen	this	in	terms	of	the	g	20	usurping	very	rapidly	the	position	of	the	g	7	,	or	the	g	8	.
and	there	are	two	consequences	of	this	.
first	,	the	west	is	rapidly	losing	its	influence	in	the	world	.
there	was	a	dramatic	illustration	of	this	actually	a	year	ago	--	copenhagen	,	climate	change	conference	.
europe	was	not	at	the	final	negotiating	table	.
when	did	that	last	happen	?
i	would	wager	it	was	probably	about	200	years	ago	.
and	that	is	what	is	going	to	happen	in	the	future	.
and	the	second	implication	is	that	the	world	will	inevitably	,	as	a	consequence	,	become	increasingly	unfamiliar	to	us	,	because	it	'll	be	shaped	by	cultures	and	experiences	and	histories	that	we	are	not	really	familiar	with	,	or	conversant	with	.
and	at	last	,	i	'm	afraid	--	take	europe	;	america	is	slightly	different	--	but	europeans	by	and	large	,	i	have	to	say	,	are	ignorant	,	are	unaware	about	the	way	the	world	is	changing	.
some	people	--	i	've	got	an	english	friend	in	china	,	and	he	said	,	``	the	continent	is	sleepwalking	into	oblivion	.	``	well	,	maybe	that	's	true	,	maybe	that	's	an	exaggeration	.
but	there	's	another	problem	which	goes	along	with	this	--	that	europe	is	increasingly	out	of	touch	with	the	world	--	and	that	is	a	sort	of	loss	of	a	sense	of	the	future	.
i	mean	,	europe	once	,	of	course	,	once	commanded	the	future	in	its	confidence	.
take	the	19th	century	,	for	example	.
but	this	,	alas	,	is	no	longer	true	.
if	you	want	to	feel	the	future	,	if	you	want	to	taste	the	future	,	try	china	--	there	's	old	confucius	.
this	is	a	railway	station	the	likes	of	which	you	've	never	seen	before	.
it	does	n't	even	look	like	a	railway	station	.
this	is	the	new	guangzhou	railway	station	for	the	high	-	speed	trains	.
china	already	has	a	bigger	network	than	any	other	country	in	the	world	and	will	soon	have	more	than	all	the	rest	of	the	world	put	together	.
or	take	this	:	now	this	is	an	idea	,	but	it	's	an	idea	to	be	tried	out	shortly	in	a	suburb	of	beijing	.
here	you	have	a	megabus	,	on	the	upper	deck	carries	about	2,000	people	.
it	travels	on	rails	down	a	suburban	road	,	and	the	cars	travel	underneath	it	.
and	it	does	speeds	of	up	to	about	100	miles	an	hour	.
now	this	is	the	way	things	are	going	to	move	,	because	china	has	a	very	specific	problem	,	which	is	different	from	europe	and	different	from	the	united	states	:
china	has	huge	numbers	of	people	and	no	space	.
so	this	is	a	solution	to	a	situation	where	china	's	going	to	have	many	,	many	,	many	cities	over	20	million	people	.
okay	,	so	how	would	i	like	to	finish	?	well	,	what	should	our	attitude	be	towards	this	world	that	we	see	very	rapidly	developing	before	us	?
i	think	there	will	be	good	things	about	it	and	there	will	be	bad	things	about	it	.
but	i	want	to	argue	,	above	all	,	a	big	-	picture	positive	for	this	world	.
for	200	years	,	the	world	was	essentially	governed	by	a	fragment	of	the	human	population	.
that	's	what	europe	and	north	america	represented	.
the	arrival	of	countries	like	china	and	india	--	between	them	38	percent	of	the	world	's	population	--	and	others	like	indonesia	and	brazil	and	so	on	,
represent	the	most	important	single	act	of	democratization	in	the	last	200	years	.
civilizations	and	cultures	,	which	had	been	ignored	,	which	had	no	voice	,	which	were	not	listened	to	,	which	were	not	known	about	,	will	have	a	different	sort	of	representation	in	this	world	.
as	humanists	,	we	must	welcome	,	surely	,	this	transformation	,
and	we	will	have	to	learn	about	these	civilizations	.
this	big	ship	here	was	the	one	sailed	in	by	zheng	he	in	the	early	15th	century	on	his	great	voyages	around	the	south	china	sea	,	the	east	china	sea	and	across	the	indian	ocean	to	east	africa	.
the	little	boat	in	front	of	it	was	the	one	in	which	,	80	years	later	,	christopher	columbus	crossed	the	atlantic	.
or	,	look	carefully	at	this	silk	scroll	made	by	zhuzhou	in	1368	.
i	think	they	're	playing	golf	.
christ	,	the	chinese	even	invented	golf	.
welcome	to	the	future	.	thank	you	.
