there	's	an	ancient	and	universal	concept	that	words	have	power	,	that	spells	exist	,	and	that	if	we	could	only	pronounce	the	right	words	,	then	--	whooosh	--	you	know	,	an	avalanche	would	come	and	wipe	out	the	hobbits	,	right	?	so	this	is	a	very	attractive	idea	because	we	're	very	lazy	,	like	the	sorcerer	's	apprentice	,	or	the	world	's	greatest	computer	programmer	.
and	so	this	idea	has	a	lot	of	traction	with	us	.
we	love	the	idea	that	words	,	when	pronounced	--	they	're	just	little	more	than	pure	information	,	but	they	evoke	some	physical	action	in	the	real	world	that	helps	us	do	work	.
and	so	,	of	course	,	with	lots	of	programmable	computers	and	robots	around	this	is	an	easy	thing	to	picture	.
so	how	many	of	you	know	what	i	'm	talking	about	?
raise	your	right	hand	.	ok	.	how	many	of	you	do	n't	know	what	i	'm	talking	about	?	raise	your	left	hand	.
so	that	's	great	.	so	that	was	too	easy	.
you	guys	have	very	insecure	computers	,	ok	?
so	now	,	the	thing	is	that	this	is	a	different	kind	of	spell	.
this	is	a	computer	program	made	of	zeros	and	ones	.
it	can	be	pronounced	on	a	computer	.	it	does	something	like	this	.
the	important	thing	is	we	can	write	it	in	a	high	-	level	language	.
a	computer	magician	can	write	this	thing	.
it	can	be	compiled	into	this	--	into	zeros	and	ones	--	and	pronounced	by	a	computer	.
and	that	's	what	makes	computers	powerful	:	these	high	-	level	languages	that	can	be	compiled	.
and	so	,	i	'm	here	to	tell	you	,	you	do	n't	need	a	computer	to	actually	have	a	spell	.	in	fact	,	what	you	can	do	at	the	molecular	level	is	that	if	you	encode	information	--	you	encode	a	spell	or	program	as	molecules	--	then	physics	can	actually	directly	interpret	that	information	and	run	a	program	.	that	's	what	happens	in	proteins	.
when	this	amino	acid	sequence	gets	pronounced	as	atoms	,	these	little	letters	are	sticky	for	each	other	.
it	collapses	into	a	three	-	dimensional	shape	that	turns	it	into	a	nanomachine	that	actually	cuts	dna	.
and	the	interesting	thing	is	that	if	you	change	the	sequence	,	you	change	the	three	-	dimensional	folding	.
you	get	now	a	dna	stapler	instead	.	these	are	the	kind	of	molecular	programs	that	we	want	to	be	able	to	write	,	but	the	problem	is	,	we	do	n't	know	the	machine	language	of	proteins	.	we	do	n't	have	a	compiler	for	proteins	.
so	i	've	joined	a	growing	band	of	people	that	try	to	make	molecular	spells	using	dna	.	we	use	dna	because	it	's	cheaper	.
it	's	easier	to	handle	.	it	's	something	that	we	understand	really	well	.
we	understand	it	so	well	,	in	fact	,	that	we	think	we	can	actually	write	programming	languages	for	dna	and	have	molecular	compilers	.
so	then	,	we	think	we	can	do	that	.	and	my	first	question	doing	this	--	or	one	of	my	questions	doing	this	--	was	how	can	you	make	an	arbitrary	shape	or	pattern	out	of	dna	?	and	i	decided	to	use	a	type	of	dna	origami	,	where	you	take	a	long	strand	of	dna	and	fold	it	into	whatever	shape	or	pattern	you	might	want	.
so	here	's	a	shape	.	i	actually	spent	about	a	year	in	my	home	,	in	my	underwear	,	coding	,	like	linus	[	torvalds	]	,	in	that	picture	before	.
and	this	program	takes	a	shape	,	spits	out	250	dna	sequences	.
these	short	dna	sequences	are	what	are	going	to	fold	the	long	strand	into	this	shape	that	we	want	to	make	.	so	you	send	an	e-mail	with	these	sequences	in	it	to	a	company	,	and	what	it	does	--	the	company	pronounces	them	on	a	dna	synthesizer	.
it	's	a	machine	about	the	size	of	a	photocopier	.	and	what	happens	is	,
they	take	your	e-mail	and	every	letter	in	your	e-mail	,	they	replace	with	30	-	atom	cluster	--	one	for	each	letter	,	a	,	t	,	c	,	and	g	in	dna	.	they	string	them	up	in	the	right	sequence	,	and	then	they	send	them	back	to	you	via	fedex	.
so	you	get	250	of	these	in	the	mail	in	little	tubes	.
i	mix	them	together	,	add	a	little	bit	of	salt	water	,	and	then	add	this	long	strand	i	was	telling	you	about	,	that	i	've	stolen	from	a	virus	.	and	then	what	happens	is	,	you	heat	this	whole	thing	up	to	about	boiling	.	you	cool	it	down	to	room	temperature	,	and	as	you	do	,	what	happens	is	those	short	strands	,	they	do	the	following	thing	:	each	one	of	them	binds	that	long	strand	in	one	place	,	and	then	has	a	second	half	that	binds	that	long	strand	in	a	distant	place	,	and	brings	those	two	parts	of	the	long	strand	close	together	so	that	they	stick	together	.
and	so	the	net	effect	of	all	250	of	these	strands	is	to	fold	the	long	strand	into	the	shape	that	you	're	looking	for	.	it	'll	approximate	that	shape	.	we	do	this	for	real	in	the	test	tube	.
in	each	little	drop	of	water	you	get	50	billion	of	these	guys	.
you	can	look	with	a	microscope	and	see	them	on	a	surface	.
and	the	neat	thing	is	that	if	you	change	the	sequence	and	change	the	spell	,	you	just	change	the	sequence	of	the	staples	.
you	can	make	a	molecule	that	looks	like	this	,	and	,	you	know	,	he	likes	to	hang	out	with	his	buddies	,	right	.
and	a	lot	of	them	are	actually	pretty	good	.
if	you	change	the	spell	again	,	you	change	the	sequence	again	.
you	get	really	nice	130	nanometer	triangles	.	if	you	do	it	again	,	you	can	get	arbitrary	patterns	.	so	on	a	rectangle	you	can	paint	patterns	of	north	and	south	america	,	or	the	words	,	``	dna	.	``
so	that	's	dna	origami	.	that	's	one	way	.	there	are	many	ways	of	casting	molecular	spells	using	dna	.
what	we	really	want	to	do	in	the	end	is	learn	how	to	program	self	-	assembly	so	that	we	can	build	anything	,	right	?
we	want	to	be	able	to	build	technological	artifacts	that	are	maybe	good	for	the	world	.	we	want	to	learn	how	to	build	biological	artifacts	,	like	people	and	whales	and	trees	.
and	if	it	's	the	case	that	we	can	reach	that	level	of	complexity	,	if	our	ability	to	program	molecules	gets	to	be	that	good	,	then	that	will	truly	be	magic	.	thank	you	very	much	.
