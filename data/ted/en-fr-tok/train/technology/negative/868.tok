today	,	i	want	you	to	look	at	children	who	become	suicide	bombers	through	a	completely	different	lens	.
in	2009	,	there	were	500	bomb	blasts	across	pakistan	.
i	spent	the	year	working	with	children	who	were	training	to	become	suicide	bombers	and	with	taliban	recruiters	,	trying	to	understand	how	the	taliban	were	converting	these	children	into	live	ammunition	and	why	these	children	were	actively	signing	up	to	their	cause	.
i	want	you	to	watch	a	short	video	from	my	latest	documentary	film	,	``	children	of	the	taliban	.	``
the	taliban	now	run	their	own	schools	.
they	target	poor	families	and	convince	the	parents	to	send	their	children	.
in	return	,	they	provide	free	food	and	shelter	and	sometimes	pay	the	families	a	monthly	stipend	.
we	've	obtained	a	propaganda	video	made	by	the	taliban	.
young	boys	are	taught	justifications	for	suicide	attacks	and	the	execution	of	spies	.
i	made	contact	with	a	child	from	swat	who	studied	in	a	madrassa	like	this	.
hazrat	ali	is	from	a	poor	farming	family	in	swat	.
he	joined	the	taliban	a	year	ago	when	he	was	13	.
how	do	the	taliban	in	your	area	get	people	to	join	them	?
hazrat	ali	:	they	first	call	us	to	the	mosque	and	preach	to	us	.
then	they	take	us	to	a	madrassa	and	teach	us	things	from	the	koran	.
sharmeen	obaid	chinoy	:	he	tells	me	that	children	are	then	given	months	of	military	training	.
ha	:	they	teach	us	to	use	machine	guns	,	kalashnikov	,	rocket	launchers	,	grenades	,	bombs	.
they	ask	us	to	use	them	only	against	the	infidels	.
then	they	teach	us	to	do	a	suicide	attack	.
soc	:	would	you	like	to	carry	out	a	suicide	attack	?
ha	:	if	god	gives	me	strength	.
soc	:	i	,	in	my	research	,	have	seen	that	the	taliban	have	perfected	the	way	in	which	they	recruit	and	train	children	,
and	i	think	it	's	a	five	-	step	process	.
step	one	is	that	the	taliban	prey	on	families	that	are	large	,	that	are	poor	,	that	live	in	rural	areas	.
they	separate	the	parents	from	the	children	by	promising	to	provide	food	,	clothing	,	shelter	to	these	children	.
then	they	ship	them	off	,	hundreds	of	miles	away	to	hard	-	line	schools	that	run	along	the	taliban	agenda	.
step	two	:
they	teach	the	children	the	koran	,	which	is	islam	's	holiest	book	,	in	arabic	,	a	language	these	children	do	not	understand	and	can	not	speak	.
they	rely	very	heavily	on	teachers	,	who	i	have	personally	seen	distort	the	message	to	these	children	as	and	when	it	suits	their	purpose	to	.
these	children	are	explicitly	forbidden	from	reading	newspapers	,	listening	to	radio	,	reading	any	books	that	the	teachers	do	not	prescribe	them	.
if	any	child	is	found	violating	these	rules	,	he	is	severely	reprimanded	.
effectively	,	the	taliban	create	a	complete	blackout	of	any	other	source	of	information	for	these	children	.
step	three	:	the	taliban	want	these	children	to	hate	the	world	that	they	currently	live	in	.
so	they	beat	these	children	--
i	have	seen	it	;
they	feed	them	twice	a	day	dried	bread	and	water	;
they	rarely	allow	them	to	play	games	;
they	tell	them	that	,	for	eight	hours	at	a	time	,	all	they	have	to	do	is	read	the	koran	.
the	children	are	virtual	prisoners	;
they	can	not	leave	,	they	can	not	go	home	.
their	parents	are	so	poor	,	they	have	no	resources	to	get	them	back	.
step	four	:	the	older	members	of	the	taliban	,	the	fighters	,	start	talking	to	the	younger	boys	about	the	glories	of	martyrdom	.
they	talk	to	them	about	how	when	they	die	,	they	will	be	received	up	with	lakes	of	honey	and	milk	,	how	there	will	be	72	virgins	waiting	for	them	in	paradise	,	how	there	will	be	unlimited	food	,	and	how	this	glory	is	going	to	propel	them	to	become	heroes	in	their	neighborhoods	.
effectively	,	this	is	the	brainwashing	process	that	has	begun	.
step	five	:	i	believe	the	taliban	have	one	of	the	most	effective	means	of	propaganda	.
their	videos	that	they	use	are	intercut	with	photographs	of	men	and	women	and	children	dying	in	iraq	and	afghanistan	and	in	pakistan	.
and	the	basic	message	is	that	the	western	powers	do	not	care	about	civilian	deaths	,	so	those	people	who	live	in	areas	and	support	governments	that	work	with	western	powers	are	fair	game	.
that	's	why	pakistani	civilians	,	over	6,000	of	whom	have	been	killed	in	the	last	two	years	alone	,	are	fair	game	.
now	these	children	are	primed	to	become	suicide	bombers	.
they	're	ready	to	go	out	and	fight	because	they	've	been	told	that	this	is	effectively	their	only	way	to	glorify	islam	.
i	want	you	to	watch	another	excerpt	from	the	film	.
this	boy	is	called	zenola	.
he	blew	himself	up	,	killing	six	.
this	boy	is	called	sadik	.
he	killed	22	.
this	boy	is	called	messoud	.
he	killed	28	.
the	taliban	are	running	suicide	schools	,	preparing	a	generation	of	boys	for	atrocities	against	civilians	.
do	you	want	to	carry	out	a	suicide	attack	?
boy	:	i	would	love	to	.
but	only	if	i	get	permission	from	my	dad	.
when	i	look	at	suicide	bombers	younger	than	me	,	or	my	age	,	i	get	so	inspired	by	their	terrific	attacks	.
soc	:	what	blessing	would	you	get	from	carrying	out	a	suicide	attack	?
boy	:	on	the	day	of	judgment	,	god	will	ask	me	,	``	why	did	you	do	that	?	``
i	will	answer	,	``	my	lord	!	only	to	make	you	happy	!
i	have	laid	down	my	life	fighting	the	infidels	.	``
then	god	will	look	at	my	intention	.
if	my	intention	was	to	eradicate	evil	for	islam	,	then	i	will	be	rewarded	with	paradise	.
singer	:	♫	on	the	day	of	judgment	♫	♫	my	god	will	call	me	♫	♫	my	body	will	be	put	back	together	♫	♫	and	god	will	ask	me	why	i	did	this	♫	soc	:	i	leave	you	all	with	this	thought	:
if	you	grew	up	in	these	circumstances	,	faced	with	these	choices	,	would	you	choose	to	live	in	this	world	or	in	the	glorious	afterlife	?
as	one	taliban	recruiter	told	me	,	``	there	will	always	be	sacrificial	lambs	in	this	war	.	``
thank	you	.
