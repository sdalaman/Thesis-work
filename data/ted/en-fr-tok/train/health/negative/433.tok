this	is	a	wheat	bread	,	a	whole	wheat	bread	,	and	it	's	made	with	a	new	technique	that	i	've	been	playing	around	with	,	and	developing	and	writing	about	which	,	for	lack	of	a	better	name	,	we	call	the	epoxy	method	.
and	i	call	it	an	epoxy	method	because	--	it	's	not	very	appetizing	.	i	understand	that	--	but	--	but	if	you	think	about	epoxy	,	what	's	epoxy	?
it	's	two	resins	that	are	,	sort	of	,	in	and	of	themselves	--	neither	of	which	can	make	glue	,	but	when	you	put	the	two	together	,	something	happens	.	a	bond	takes	place	,	and	you	get	this	very	strong	,	powerful	adhesive	.
well	,	in	this	technique	,	what	i	've	tried	to	do	is	kind	of	gather	all	of	the	knowledge	that	the	bread	-	baking	world	,	the	artisan	bread	-	baking	community	,	has	been	trying	to	accumulate	over	the	last	20	years	or	so	--	since	we	've	been	engaged	in	a	bread	renaissance	in	america	--	and	put	it	together	to	come	up	with	a	method	that	would	help	to	take	whole	-	grain	breads	.
and	let	's	face	it	,	everyone	's	trying	to	move	towards	whole	grains	.
we	finally	,	after	40	years	of	knowing	that	wholegrain	was	a	healthier	option	,	we	're	finally	getting	to	the	point	where	we	actually	are	tipping	over	and	attempting	to	actually	eat	them	.
the	challenge	,	though	,	for	a	wholegrain	baker	is	,	you	know	,	how	do	you	make	it	taste	good	?
because	whole	grain	--	it	's	easy	with	white	flour	to	make	a	good	-	tasting	bread	.	white	flour	is	sweet	.
it	's	mainly	starch	,	and	starch	,	when	you	break	it	down	--	what	is	starch	?	it	's	--	thank	you	--	sugar	,	yes	.
so	a	baker	,	and	a	good	baker	,	knows	how	to	pull	or	draw	forth	the	inherent	sugar	trapped	in	the	starch	.
with	whole	grain	bread	,	you	have	other	obstacles	.
you	've	got	bran	,	which	is	probably	the	healthiest	part	of	the	bread	for	us	,	or	the	fiber	for	us	because	it	is	just	loaded	with	fiber	,
for	the	bran	is	fiber	.
it	's	got	germ	.	those	are	the	good	things	,	but	those	are	n't	the	tastiest	parts	of	the	wheat	.
so	whole	grain	breads	historically	have	had	sort	of	this	onus	of	being	health	food	breads	,
and	people	do	n't	like	to	eat	,	quote	,	health	food	.	they	like	to	eat	healthy	and	healthily	,	but	when	we	think	of	something	as	a	health	food	,	we	think	of	it	as	something	we	eat	out	of	obligation	,	not	out	of	passion	and	love	for	the	flavor	.
and	ultimately	,	the	challenge	of	the	baker	,	the	challenge	of	every	culinary	student	,	of	every	chef	,	is	to	deliver	flavor	.
flavor	is	king	.	flavor	rules	.
i	call	it	the	flavor	rule	.	flavor	rules	.
and	--	and
you	can	get	somebody	to	eat	something	that	's	good	for	them	once	,	but	they	wo	n't	eat	it	again	if	they	do	n't	like	it	,	right	?
so	,	this	is	the	challenge	for	this	bread	.
we	're	going	to	try	this	at	lunch	,	and	i	'll	explain	a	bit	more	about	it	,	but	it	's	made	not	only	with	two	types	of	pre	-	doughs	--
this	attempt	,	again	,	at	bringing	out	flavor	is	to	make	a	piece	of	dough	the	day	before	that	is	not	leavened	.
it	's	just	dough	that	is	wet	.
it	's	hydrated	dough	we	call	``	the	soaker	``	--	that	helps	to	start	enzyme	activity	.
and	enzymes	are	the	secret	,	kind	of	,	ingredient	in	dough	that	brings	out	flavor	.
it	starts	to	release	the	sugars	trapped	in	the	starch	.
that	's	what	enzymes	are	doing	.
and	so	,	if	we	can	release	some	of	those	,	they	become	accessible	to	us	in	our	palate	.
they	become	accessible	to	the	yeast	as	food	.
they	become	accessible	to	the	oven	for	caramelization	to	give	us	a	beautiful	crust	.
the	other	pre	-	dough	that	we	make	is	fermented	--	our	pre	-	ferment	.
and	it	's	made	--	it	can	be	a	sourdough	starter	,	or	what	we	call	a	``	biga	``	or	any	other	kind	of	pre	-	fermented	dough	with	a	little	yeast	in	it	,
and	that	starts	to	develop	flavor	also	.
and	on	day	two	,	we	put	those	two	pieces	together	.	that	's	the	epoxy	.
and	we	're	hoping	that	,	sort	of	,	the	enzyme	piece	of	dough	becomes	the	fuel	pack	for	the	leavened	piece	of	dough	,
and	when	we	put	them	together	and	add	the	final	ingredients	,	we	can	create	a	bread	that	does	evoke	the	full	potential	of	flavor	trapped	in	the	grain	.
that	's	the	challenge	.	okay	,	so	,	now	,	what	we	--
in	the	journey	of	wheat	,	let	's	go	back	and	look	at	these	12	stages	.
i	'm	going	to	go	through	them	very	quickly	and	then	revisit	them	.
okay	,	we	're	going	to	start	with	the	first	stage	.
and	this	is	what	every	student	has	to	begin	with	.
everyone	who	works	in	the	culinary	world	knows	that	the	first	stage	of	cooking	is	``	mise	en	place	,	``
which	is	just	a	french	way	of	saying	,	``	get	organized	.	``
everything	in	its	place	.	first	stage	.
so	in	baking	we	call	it	scaling	--	weighing	out	the	ingredients	.
stage	two	is	mixing	.	we	take	the	ingredients	and	we	mix	them	.
we	have	to	develop	the	gluten	.
there	's	no	gluten	in	flour	.	there	's	only	the	potential	for	gluten	.
here	's	another	kind	of	prefiguring	of	epoxy	because	we	've	got	glutenin	and	gliadin	,
neither	of	which	are	strong	enough	to	make	a	good	bread	.	but	when	they	get	hydrated	and	they	bond	to	each	other	,	they	create	a	stronger	molecule	,	a	stronger	protein	we	call	gluten	.
and	so	we	,	in	the	mixing	process	,	have	to	develop	the	gluten	,	we	have	to	activate	the	leaven	or	the	yeast	,	and	we	have	to	essentially	distribute	all	the	ingredients	evenly	.
then	we	get	into	fermentation	,	the	third	stage	,	which	is	really	where	the	flavor	develops	.
the	yeast	comes	alive	and	starts	eating	the	sugars	,	creating	carbon	dioxide	and	alcohol	--
essentially	it	's	burping	and	sweating	,	which	is	what	bread	is	.	it	's	yeast	burps	and	sweat	.
and	somehow	,	this	is	transformed	--	the	yeast	burps	and	sweats	are	later	transformed	--	and	this	is	really	getting	to	the	heart	of	what	makes	bread	so	special	is	that	it	is	a	transformational	food	,
and	we	're	going	to	explore	that	in	a	minute	.	but	then	,	quickly	through	the	next	few	stages	.
we	,	after	it	's	fermented	and	it	's	developed	,	started	to	develop	flavor	and	character	,	we	divide	it	into	smaller	units	.
and	then	we	take	those	units	and	we	shape	them	.	we	give	them	a	little	pre	-	shape	,	usually	a	round	or	a	little	torpedo	shape	,	sometimes	.
that	's	called	``	rounding	.	``
and	there	's	a	short	rest	period	.	it	can	be	for	a	few	seconds	.
it	can	be	for	20	or	30	minutes	.	we	call	that	resting	or	benching	.
then	we	go	into	final	shaping	,	``	panning	``	--	which	means	putting	the	shaped	loaf	on	a	pan	.
this	takes	a	second	,	but	it	's	a	distinctive	stage	.
it	can	be	in	a	basket	.	it	can	be	in	a	loaf	pan	,	but	we	pan	it	.
and	then	,	stage	nine	.
the	fermentation	which	started	at	stage	three	is	continuing	through	all	these	other	stages	.	again	,	developing	more	flavor	.
the	final	fermentation	takes	place	in	stage	nine	.
we	call	it	``	proofing	.	``
proofing	means	to	prove	that	the	dough	is	alive	.
and	at	stage	nine	we	get	the	dough	to	the	final	shape	,	and	it	goes	into	the	oven	--	stage	10	.
three	transformations	take	place	in	the	oven	.
the	sugars	in	the	dough	caramelize	in	the	crust	.
they	give	us	that	beautiful	brown	crust	.
only	the	crust	can	caramelize	.	it	's	the	only	place	that	gets	hot	enough	.
inside	,	the	proteins	--	this	gluten	--	coagulates	.
when	it	gets	to	about	160	degrees	,	the	proteins	all	line	up	and	they	create	structure	,	the	gluten	structure	--	what	ultimately	we	will	call	the	crumb	of	the	bread	.
and	the	starches	,	when	they	reach	about	180	degrees	,	gelatinize	.
and	gelatinization	is	yet	another	oven	transformation	.
coagulation	,	caramelization	and	gelatinization	--
when	the	starch	is	thick	and	they	absorb	all	the	moisture	that	's	around	them	,	they	--	they	kind	of	swell	,	and	then	they	burst	.
and	they	burst	,	and	they	spill	their	guts	into	the	bread	.
so	basically	now	we	're	eating	yeast	sweats	--	sweat	,	burps	and	starch	guts	.
again	,	transformed	in	stage	10	in	the	oven	because	what	went	into	the	oven	as	dough	comes	out	in	stage	11	as	bread	.
and	stage	11	,	we	call	it	cooling	--	because	we	never	really	eat	the	bread	right	away	.
there	's	a	little	carry	-	over	baking	.
the	proteins	have	to	set	up	,	strengthen	and	firm	up	.
and	then	we	have	stage	12	,	which	the	textbooks	call	``	packaging	,	``	but	my	students	call	``	eating	.	``
and	so	,	we	're	going	to	be	on	our	own	journey	today	from	wheat	to	eat	,	and	in	a	few	minutes	we	will	try	this	,	and	see	if	we	have	succeeded	in	fulfilling	this	baker	's	mission	of	pulling	out	flavor	.
but	i	want	to	go	back	now	and	revisit	these	steps	,	and	talk	about	it	from	the	standpoint	of	transformation	,	because	i	really	believe	that	all	things	can	be	understood	--
and	this	is	not	my	own	idea	.	this	goes	back	to	the	scholastics	and	to	the	ancients	--	that	all	things	can	be	understood	on	four	levels	:	the	literal	,	the	metaphoric	or	poetic	level	,	the	political	or	ethical	level	.	and	ultimately	,	the	mystical	or	sometimes	called	the	``	anagogical	``	level	.
it	's	hard	to	get	to	those	levels	unless	you	go	through	the	literal	.
in	fact	,	dante	says	you	ca	n't	understand	the	three	deeper	levels	unless	you	first	understand	the	literal	level	,
so	that	's	why	we	're	talking	literally	about	bread	.
from	the	standpoint	of	connections	to	possibly	a	deeper	level	--	all	in	my	quest	for	answering	the	question	,	``	what	is	it	about	bread	that	's	so	special	?	``
and	fulfilling	this	mission	of	evoking	the	full	potential	of	flavor	.
because	what	happens	is	,	bread	begins	as	wheat	or	any	other	grain	.
but	what	's	wheat	?	wheat	is	a	grass	that	grows	in	the	field	.
and	,	like	all	grasses	,	at	a	certain	point	it	puts	out	seeds	.
and	we	harvest	those	seeds	,	and	those	are	the	wheat	kernels	.
now	,	in	order	to	harvest	it	--	i	mean	,	what	's	harvesting	?
it	's	just	a	euphemism	for	killing	,	right	?
i	mean	,	that	's	what	's	harvest	--	we	say	we	harvest	the	pig	,	you	know	?
yes	,	we	slaughter	,	you	know	.	yes	,	that	's	life	.
we	harvest	the	wheat	,	and	in	harvesting	it	,	we	kill	it	.
now	,	wheat	is	alive	,	and	as	we	harvest	it	,	it	gives	up	its	seeds	.
now	,	at	least	with	seeds	we	have	the	potential	for	future	life	.
we	can	plant	those	in	the	ground	.	and	we	save	some	of	those	for	the	next	generation	.
but	most	of	those	seeds	get	crushed	and	turned	into	flour	.
and	at	that	point	,	the	wheat	has	suffered	the	ultimate	indignity	.
it	's	not	only	been	killed	,	but	it	's	been	denied	any	potential	for	creating	future	life	.
so	we	turn	it	into	flour	.
so	as	i	said	,	i	think	bread	is	a	transformational	food	.
the	first	transformation	--	and	,	by	the	way	,	the	definition	of	transformation	for	me	is	a	radical	change	from	one	thing	into	something	else	.
o.k	.	?	radical	,	not	subtle	.
not	like	hot	water	made	cold	,	or	cold	water	turned	hot	,	but	water	boiled	off	and	becoming	steam	.
that	's	a	transformation	,	two	different	things	.
well	,	in	this	case	,	the	first	transformation	is	alive	to	dead	.
i	'd	call	that	radical	.
so	,	we	've	got	now	this	flour	.
and	what	do	we	do	?	we	add	some	water	.
in	stage	one	,	we	weigh	it	.
in	stage	two	,	we	add	water	and	salt	to	it	,	mix	it	together	,	and	we	create	something	that	we	call	``	clay	.	``
it	's	like	clay	.
and	we	infuse	that	clay	with	an	ingredient	that	we	call	``	leaven	.	``
in	this	case	,	it	's	yeast	,	but	yeast	is	leaven	.	what	does	leaven	mean	?
leaven	comes	from	the	root	word	that	means	enliven	--	to	vivify	,	to	bring	to	life	.
by	the	way	,	what	's	the	hebrew	word	for	clay	?	adam	.
you	see	,	the	baker	,	in	this	moment	,	has	become	,	in	a	sense	,	sort	of	,	the	god	of	his	dough	,	you	know	,	and	his	dough	,	well	,	while	it	's	not	an	intelligent	life	form	,	is	now	alive	.
and	we	know	it	's	alive	because	in	stage	three	,	it	grows	.	growth	is	the	proof	of	life	.
and	while	it	's	growing	,	all	these	literal	transformations	are	taking	place	.
enzymes	are	breaking	forth	sugars	.
yeast	is	eating	sugar	and	turning	it	into	carbon	dioxide	and	alcohol	.
bacteria	is	in	there	,	eating	the	same	sugars	,	turning	them	into	acids	.
in	other	words	,	personality	and	character	's	being	developed	in	this	dough	under	the	watchful	gaze	of	the	baker	.
and	the	baker	's	choices	all	along	the	way	determine	the	outcome	of	the	product	.
a	subtle	change	in	temperature	--	a	subtle	change	in	time	--	it	's	all	about	a	balancing	act	between	time	,	temperature	and	ingredients	.	that	's	the	art	of	baking	.
so	all	these	things	are	determined	by	the	baker	,	and	the	bread	goes	through	some	stages	,	and	characters	develop	.
and	then	we	divide	it	,	and	this	one	big	piece	of	dough	is	divided	into	smaller	units	,	and	each	of	those	units	are	given	shape	by	the	baker	.
and	as	they	're	shaped	,	they	're	raised	again	,	all	along	proving	that	they	're	alive	,	and	developing	character	.
and	at	stage	10	,	we	take	it	to	the	oven	.
it	's	still	dough	.	nobody	eats	bread	dough	--
a	few	people	do	,	i	think	,	but	not	too	many	.
i	've	met	some	dough	eaters	,	but	--	it	's	not	the	staff	of	life	,	right	?	bread	is	the	staff	of	life	.
but	dough	is	what	we	're	working	with	,	and	we	take	that	dough	to	the	oven	,
and	it	goes	into	the	oven	.	as	soon	as	the	interior	temperature	of	that	dough	crosses	the	threshold	of	140	degrees	,	it	passes	what	we	call	the	``	thermal	death	point	.	``
students	love	that	tdp	.	they	think	it	's	the	name	of	a	video	game	.	but	it	's	the	thermal	death	point	--	all	life	ceases	there	.
the	yeast	,	whose	mission	it	has	been	up	till	now	to	raise	the	dough	,	to	enliven	it	,	to	vivify	it	,	in	order	to	complete	its	mission	,	which	is	also	to	turn	this	dough	into	bread	,	has	to	give	up	its	life	.
so	you	see	the	symbolism	at	work	?	it	's	starting	to	come	forth	a	little	bit	,	you	know	.
it	's	starting	to	make	sense	to	me	--	what	goes	in	is	dough	,	what	comes	out	is	bread	--	or	it	goes	in	alive	,	comes	out	dead	.
third	transformation	.	first	transformation	,	alive	to	dead	.
second	transformation	,	dead	brought	back	to	life	.
third	transformation	,	alive	to	dead	--
but	dough	to	bread	.
or	another	analogy	would	be	,	a	caterpillar	has	been	turned	into	a	butterfly	.
and	it	's	what	comes	out	of	the	oven	that	is	what	we	call	the	staff	of	life	.
this	is	the	product	that	everyone	in	the	world	eats	,	that	is	so	difficult	to	give	up	.
it	's	so	deeply	embedded	in	our	psyches	that	bread	is	used	as	a	symbol	for	life	.
it	's	used	as	a	symbol	for	transformation	.
and	so	,	as	we	get	to	stage	12	and	we	partake	of	that	,	again	completing	the	life	cycle	,	you	know	,	we	have	a	chance	to	essentially	ingest	that	--
it	nurtures	us	,	and	we	continue	to	carry	on	and	have	opportunities	to	ponder	things	like	this	.
so	this	is	what	i	've	learned	from	bread	.
this	is	what	bread	has	taught	me	in	my	journey	.
and	what	we	're	going	to	attempt	to	do	with	this	bread	here	,	again	,	is	to	use	,	in	addition	to	everything	we	talked	about	,	this	bread	we	're	going	to	call	``	spent	grain	bread	``	because	,	as	you	know	,	bread	-	making	is	very	similar	to	beer	-	making	.
beer	is	basically	liquid	bread	,	or	bread	is	solid	beer	.
and	--
they	--	they	're	invented	around	the	same	time	.	i	think	beer	came	first	.
and	the	egyptian	who	was	tending	the	beer	fell	asleep	in	the	hot	,	egyptian	sun	,	and	it	turned	into	bread	.
but	we	've	got	this	bread	,	and	what	i	did	here	is	to	try	to	,	again	,	evoke	even	more	flavor	from	this	grain	,	was	we	've	added	into	it	the	spent	grain	from	beer	-	making	.
and	if	you	make	this	bread	,	you	can	use	any	kind	of	spent	grain	from	any	type	of	beer	.
i	like	dark	spent	grain	.	today	we	're	using	a	light	spent	grain	that	's	actually	from	,	like	,	some	kind	of	a	lager	of	some	sort	--	a	light	lager	or	an	ale	--	that	is	wheat	and	barley	that	's	been	toasted	.
in	other	words	,	the	beer	-	maker	knows	also	how	to	evoke	flavor	from	the	grains	by	using	sprouting	and	malting	and	roasting	.
we	're	going	to	take	some	of	that	,	and	put	it	into	the	bread	.
so	now	we	not	only	have	a	high	-	fiber	bread	,	but	now	fiber	on	top	of	fiber	.	and	so	this	is	,	again	,	hopefully	not	only	a	healthy	bread	,	but	a	bread	that	you	will	enjoy	.
so	,	if	i	,	kind	of	,	break	this	bread	,	maybe	we	can	share	this	now	a	little	bit	here	.
we	'll	start	a	little	piece	here	,
and	i	'm	going	to	take	a	little	piece	here	--
i	think	i	'd	better	taste	it	myself	before	you	have	it	at	lunch	.
i	'll	leave	you	with	what	i	call	the	baker	's	blessing	.
may	your	crust	be	crisp	,	and	your	bread	always	rise	.
thank	you	.
