i	'm	a	filmmaker	.
for	the	last	8	years	,	i	have	dedicated	my	life	to	documenting	the	work	of	israelis	and	palestinians	who	are	trying	to	end	the	conflict	using	peaceful	means	.
when	i	travel	with	my	work	across	europe	and	the	united	states	,	one	question	always	comes	up	:	where	is	the	palestinian	gandhi	?
why	are	n't	palestinians	using	nonviolent	resistance	?
the	challenge	i	face	when	i	hear	this	question	is	that	often	i	have	just	returned	from	the	middle	east	where	i	spent	my	time	filming	dozens	of	palestinians	who	are	using	nonviolence	to	defend	their	lands	and	water	resources	from	israeli	soldiers	and	settlers	.
these	leaders	are	trying	to	forge	a	massive	national	nonviolent	movement	to	end	the	occupation	and	build	peace	in	the	region	.
yet	,	most	of	you	have	probably	never	heard	about	them	.
this	divide	between	what	's	happening	on	the	ground	and	perceptions	abroad	is	one	of	the	key	reasons	why	we	do	n't	have	yet	a	palestinian	peaceful	resistance	movement	that	has	been	successful	.
so	i	'm	here	today	to	talk	about	the	power	of	attention	,	the	power	of	your	attention	,	and	the	emergence	and	development	of	nonviolent	movements	in	the	west	bank	,	gaza	and	elsewhere	--	but	today	,	my	case	study	is	going	to	be	palestine	.
i	believe	that	what	's	mostly	missing	for	nonviolence	to	grow	is	not	for	palestinians	to	start	adopting	nonviolence	,	but	for	us	to	start	paying	attention	to	those	who	already	are	.
allow	me	to	illustrate	this	point	by	taking	you	to	this	village	called	budrus	.
about	seven	years	ago	,	they	faced	extinction	,	because	israel	announced	it	would	build	a	separation	barrier	,	and	part	of	this	barrier	would	be	built	on	top	of	the	village	.	they	would	lose	40	percent	of	their	land	and	be	surrounded	,	so	they	would	lose	free	access	to	the	rest	of	the	west	bank	.
through	inspired	local	leadership	,	they	launched	a	peaceful	resistance	campaign	to	stop	that	from	happening	.
let	me	show	you	some	brief	clips	,	so	you	have	a	sense	for	what	that	actually	looked	like	on	the	ground	.
palestinian	woman	:	we	were	told	the	wall	would	separate	palestine	from	israel	.
here	in	budrus	,	we	realized	the	wall	would	steal	our	land	.
israeli	man	:	the	fence	has	,	in	fact	,	created	a	solution	to	terror	.
man	:	today	you	're	invited	to	a	peaceful	march	.
you	are	joined	by	dozens	of	your	israeli	brothers	and	sisters	.
israeli	activist	:	nothing	scares	the	army	more	than	nonviolent	opposition	.
woman	:	we	saw	the	men	trying	to	push	the	soldiers	,	but	none	of	them	could	do	that	.
but	i	think	the	girls	could	do	it	.
fatah	party	member	:	we	must	empty	our	minds	of	traditional	thinking	.
hamas	party	member	:	we	were	in	complete	harmony	,	and	we	wanted	to	spread	it	to	all	of	palestine	.
chanting	:	one	united	nation	.
fatah	,	hamas	and	the	popular	front	!
news	anchor	:	the	clashes	over	the	fence	continue	.
reporter	:	israeli	border	police	were	sent	to	disperse	the	crowd	.
they	were	allowed	to	use	any	force	necessary	.
man	:	these	are	live	bullets	.
it	's	like	fallujah	.	shooting	everywhere	.
israeli	activist	:	i	was	sure	we	were	all	going	to	die	.
but	there	were	others	around	me	who	were	n't	even	cowering	.
israeli	soldier	:	a	nonviolent	protest	is	not	going	to	stop	the	[	unclear	]	.
protester	:	this	is	a	peaceful	march	.
there	is	no	need	to	use	violence	.
chanting	:	we	can	do	it	!	we	can	do	it	!
we	can	do	it	!
julia	bacha	:	when	i	first	heard	about	the	story	of	budrus	,	i	was	surprised	that	the	international	media	had	failed	to	cover	the	extraordinary	set	of	events	that	happened	seven	years	ago	,	in	2003	.
what	was	even	more	surprising	was	the	fact	that	budrus	was	successful	.
the	residents	,	after	10	months	of	peaceful	resistance	,	convinced	the	israeli	government	to	move	the	route	of	the	barrier	off	their	lands	and	to	the	green	line	,	which	is	the	internationally	recognized	boundary	between	israel	and	the	palestinian	territories	.
the	resistance	in	budrus	has	since	spread	to	villages	across	the	west	bank	and	to	palestinian	neighborhoods	in	jerusalem	.
yet	the	media	remains	mostly	silent	on	these	stories	.
this	silence	carries	profound	consequences	for	the	likelihood	that	nonviolence	can	grow	,	or	even	survive	,	in	palestine	.
violent	resistance	and	nonviolent	resistance	share	one	very	important	thing	in	common	;	they	are	both	a	form	of	theater	seeking	an	audience	to	their	cause	.
if	violent	actors	are	the	only	ones	constantly	getting	front	-	page	covers	and	attracting	international	attention	to	the	palestinian	issue	,	it	becomes	very	hard	for	nonviolent	leaders	to	make	the	case	to	their	communities	that	civil	disobedience	is	a	viable	option	in	addressing	their	plight	.
the	power	of	attention	is	probably	going	to	come	as	no	surprise	to	the	parents	in	the	room	.
the	surest	way	to	make	your	child	throw	increasingly	louder	tantrums	is	by	giving	him	attention	the	first	time	he	throws	a	fit	.
the	tantrum	will	become	what	childhood	psychologists	call	a	functional	behavior	,	since	the	child	has	learned	that	he	can	get	parental	attention	out	of	it	.
parents	can	incentivize	or	disincentivize	behavior	simply	by	giving	or	withdrawing	attention	to	their	children	.
but	that	's	true	for	adults	too	.
in	fact	,	the	behavior	of	entire	communities	and	countries	can	be	influenced	,	depending	on	where	the	international	community	chooses	to	focus	its	attention	.
i	believe	that	at	the	core	of	ending	the	conflict	in	the	middle	east	and	bringing	peace	is	for	us	to	transform	nonviolence	into	a	functional	behavior	by	giving	a	lot	more	attention	to	the	nonviolent	leaders	on	the	ground	today	.
in	the	course	of	taking	my	film	to	villages	in	the	west	bank	,	in	gaza	and	in	east	jerusalem	,	i	have	seen	the	impact	that	even	one	documentary	film	can	have	in	influencing	the	transformation	.
in	a	village	called	wallajeh	,	which	sits	very	close	to	jerusalem	,	the	community	was	facing	a	very	similar	plight	to	budrus	.
they	were	going	to	be	surrounded	,	lose	a	lot	of	their	lands	and	not	have	freedom	of	access	,	either	to	the	west	bank	or	jerusalem	.
they	had	been	using	nonviolence	for	about	two	years	but	had	grown	disenchanted	since	nobody	was	paying	attention	.
so	we	organized	a	screening	.
a	week	later	,	they	held	the	most	well	-	attended	and	disciplined	demonstration	to	date	.
the	organizers	say	that	the	villagers	,	upon	seeing	the	story	of	budrus	documented	in	a	film	,	felt	that	there	were	indeed	people	following	what	they	were	doing	,	that	people	cared	.
so	they	kept	on	going	.
on	the	israeli	side	,	there	is	a	new	peace	movement	called	solidariot	,	which	means	solidarity	in	hebrew	.
the	leaders	of	this	movement	have	been	using	budrus	as	one	of	their	primary	recruiting	tools	.
they	report	that	israelis	who	had	never	been	active	before	,	upon	seeing	the	film	,	understand	the	power	of	nonviolence	and	start	joining	their	activities	.
the	examples	of	wallajeh	and	the	solidariot	movement	show	that	even	a	small	-	budget	independent	film	can	play	a	role	in	transforming	nonviolence	into	a	functional	behavior	.
now	imagine	the	power	that	big	media	players	could	have	if	they	started	covering	the	weekly	nonviolent	demonstrations	happening	in	villages	like	bil'in	,	ni'lin	,	wallajeh	,	in	jerusalem	neighborhoods	like	sheikh	jarrah	and	silwan	--	the	nonviolent	leaders	would	become	more	visible	,	valued	and	effective	in	their	work	.
i	believe	that	the	most	important	thing	is	to	understand	that	if	we	do	n't	pay	attention	to	these	efforts	,	they	are	invisible	,	and	it	's	as	if	they	never	happened	.
but	i	have	seen	first	hand	that	if	we	do	,	they	will	multiply	.
if	they	multiply	,	their	influence	will	grow	in	the	overall	israeli	-	palestinian	conflict	.
and	theirs	is	the	kind	of	influence	that	can	finally	unblock	the	situation	.
these	leaders	have	proven	that	nonviolence	works	in	places	like	budrus	.
let	's	give	them	attention	so	they	can	prove	it	works	everywhere	.
thank	you	.
