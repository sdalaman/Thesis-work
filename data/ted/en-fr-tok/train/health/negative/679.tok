i	'm	going	to	talk	about	compassion	and	the	golden	rule	from	a	secular	perspective	and	even	from	a	kind	of	scientific	perspective	.
i	'm	going	to	try	to	give	you	a	little	bit	of	a	natural	history	of	compassion	and	the	golden	rule	.
so	,	i	'm	going	to	be	sometimes	using	kind	of	clinical	language	,	and	so	it	's	not	going	to	sound	as	warm	and	fuzzy	as	your	average	compassion	talk	.
i	want	to	warn	you	about	that	.
so	,	i	do	want	to	say	,	at	the	outset	,	that	i	think	compassion	's	great	.
the	golden	rule	is	great	.	i	'm	a	big	supporter	of	both	.
and	i	think	it	's	great	that	the	leaders	of	the	religions	of	the	world	are	affirming	compassion	and	the	golden	rule	as	fundamental	principles	that	are	integral	to	their	faiths	.
at	the	same	time	,	i	think	religions	do	n't	deserve	all	the	credit	.
i	think	nature	gave	them	a	helping	hand	here	.
i	'm	going	to	argue	tonight	that	compassion	and	the	golden	rule	are	,	in	a	certain	sense	,	built	into	human	nature	.
but	i	'm	also	going	to	argue	that	once	you	understand	the	sense	in	which	they	are	built	into	human	nature	,	you	realize	that	just	affirming	compassion	,	and	affirming	the	golden	rule	,	is	really	not	enough	.
there	's	a	lot	of	work	to	be	done	after	that	.
ok	so	,	a	quick	natural	history	,	first	of	compassion	.
in	the	beginning	,	there	was	compassion	,	and	i	mean	not	just	when	human	beings	first	showed	up	,	but	actually	even	before	that	.
i	think	it	's	probably	the	case	that	,	in	the	human	evolutionary	lineage	,	even	before	there	were	homo	sapiens	,	feelings	like	compassion	and	love	and	sympathy	had	earned	their	way	into	the	gene	pool	,	and	biologists	have	a	pretty	clear	idea	of	how	this	first	happened	.
it	happened	through	a	principle	known	as	kin	selection	.
and	the	basic	idea	of	kin	selection	is	that	,	if	an	animal	feels	compassion	for	a	close	relative	,	and	this	compassion	leads	the	animal	to	help	the	relative	,	then	,	in	the	end	,	the	compassion	actually	winds	up	helping	the	genes	underlying	the	compassion	itself	.
so	,	from	a	biologist	's	point	of	view	,	compassion	is	actually	a	gene	's	way	of	helping	itself	.	ok	.
i	warned	you	this	was	not	going	to	be	very	warm	and	fuzzy	.
i	'll	get	there	--	i	hope	to	get	a	little	fuzzier	.
this	does	n't	bother	me	so	much	,	that	the	underlying	darwinian	rationale	of	compassion	is	kind	of	self	-	serving	at	the	genetic	level	.
actually	,	i	think	the	bad	news	about	kin	selection	is	just	that	it	means	that	this	kind	of	compassion	is	naturally	deployed	only	within	the	family	.
that	's	the	bad	news	.	the	good	news	is	compassion	is	natural	.
the	bad	news	is	that	this	kin	selected	compassion	is	naturally	confined	to	the	family	.
now	,	there	's	more	good	news	that	came	along	later	in	evolution	,	a	second	kind	of	evolutionary	logic	.
biologists	call	that	``	reciprocal	altruism	.	``	ok	.
and	there	,	the	basic	idea	is	that	compassion	leads	you	to	do	good	things	for	people	who	then	will	return	the	favor	.
again	,	i	know	this	is	not	as	inspiring	a	notion	of	compassion	as	you	may	have	heard	in	the	past	,	but	from	a	biologist	's	point	of	view	,	this	reciprocal	altruism	kind	of	compassion	is	ultimately	self	-	serving	too	.
it	's	not	that	people	think	that	,	when	they	feel	the	compassion	.
it	's	not	consciously	self	-	serving	,	but	to	a	biologist	,	that	's	the	logic	.
and	so	,	you	wind	up	most	easily	extending	compassion	to	friends	and	allies	.
i	'm	sure	a	lot	of	you	,	if	a	close	friend	has	something	really	terrible	happen	to	them	,	you	feel	really	bad	.
but	if	you	read	in	the	newspaper	that	something	really	horrible	happened	to	somebody	you	've	never	heard	of	,	you	can	probably	live	with	that	.
that	's	just	human	nature	.
so	,	it	's	another	good	news	/	bad	news	story	.
it	's	good	that	compassion	was	extended	beyond	the	family	by	this	kind	of	evolutionary	logic	.
the	bad	news	is	this	does	n't	bring	us	universal	compassion	by	itself	.
so	,	there	's	still	work	to	be	done	.
now	,	there	's	one	other	result	of	this	dynamic	called	reciprocal	altruism	,	which	i	think	is	kind	of	good	news	,	which	is	that	the	way	that	this	is	played	out	in	the	human	species	,	it	has	given	people	an	intuitive	appreciation	of	the	golden	rule	.
i	do	n't	quite	mean	that	the	golden	rule	itself	is	written	in	our	genes	,	but	you	can	go	to	a	hunter	gatherer	society	that	has	had	no	exposure	to	any	of	the	great	religious	traditions	,	no	exposure	to	ethical	philosophy	,	and	you	'll	find	,	if	you	spend	time	with	these	people	,	that	,	basically	,	they	believe	that	one	good	turn	deserves	another	,	and	that	bad	deeds	should	be	punished	.
and	evolutionary	psychologists	think	that	these	intuitions	have	a	basis	in	the	genes	.
so	,	they	do	understand	that	if	you	want	to	be	treated	well	,	you	treat	other	people	well	.
and	it	's	good	to	treat	other	people	well	.
that	's	close	to	being	a	kind	of	built	-	in	intuition	.
so	,	that	's	good	news	.	now	,	if	you	've	been	paying	attention	,	you	're	probably	anticipating	that	there	's	bad	news	here	;	we	still	are	n't	to	universal	love	,	and	it	's	true	because	,	although	an	appreciation	of	the	golden	rule	is	natural	,	it	's	also	natural	to	carve	out	exceptions	to	the	golden	rule	.
i	mean	,	for	example	,	none	of	us	,	probably	,	want	to	go	to	prison	,	but	we	all	think	that	there	are	some	people	who	should	go	to	prison	.	right	?
so	,	we	think	we	should	treat	them	differently	than	we	would	want	to	be	treated	.
now	,	we	have	a	rationale	for	that	.
we	say	they	did	these	bad	things	that	make	it	just	that	they	should	go	to	prison	.
none	of	us	really	extends	the	golden	rule	in	truly	diffuse	and	universal	fashion	.
we	have	the	capacity	to	carve	out	exceptions	,	put	people	in	a	special	category	.
and	the	problem	is	that	--	although	in	the	case	of	sending	people	to	prison	,	you	have	this	impartial	judiciary	determining	who	gets	excluded	from	the	golden	rule	--	that	in	everyday	life	,	the	way	we	all	make	these	decisions	about	who	we	're	not	going	to	extend	the	golden	rule	to	,	is	we	use	a	much	rougher	and	readier	formula	.	basically	it	's	just	like	,	if	you	're	my	enemy	,	if	you	're	my	rival	--	if	you	're	not	my	friend	,	if	you	're	not	in	my	family	--	i	'm	much	less	inclined	to	apply	the	golden	rule	to	you	.
we	all	do	that	,	and	you	see	it	all	over	the	world	.
you	see	it	in	the	middle	east	:
people	who	,	from	gaza	,	are	firing	missiles	at	israel	.
they	would	n't	want	to	have	missiles	fired	at	them	,	but	they	say	,	``	well	,	but	the	israelis	,	or	some	of	them	have	done	things	that	put	them	in	a	special	category	.	``
the	israelis	would	not	want	to	have	an	economic	blockade	imposed	on	them	,	but	they	impose	one	on	gaza	,	and	they	say	,	``	well	,	the	palestinians	,	or	some	of	them	,	have	brought	this	on	themselves	.	``
so	,	it	's	these	exclusions	to	the	golden	rule	that	amount	to	a	lot	of	the	world	's	trouble	.
and	it	's	natural	to	do	that	.
so	,	the	fact	that	the	golden	rule	is	in	some	sense	built	in	to	us	is	not	,	by	itself	,	going	to	bring	us	universal	love	.
it	's	not	going	to	save	the	world	.	now	,	there	's	one	piece	of	good	news	i	have	that	may	save	the	world	.	okay	.
are	you	on	the	edges	of	your	seats	here	?
good	,	because	before	i	tell	you	about	that	good	news	,	i	'm	going	to	have	to	take	a	little	excursion	through	some	academic	terrain	.
so	,	i	hope	i	've	got	your	attention	with	this	promise	of	good	news	that	may	save	the	world	.
it	's	this	non	-	zero	-	sumness	stuff	you	just	heard	a	little	bit	about	.
it	's	just	a	quick	introduction	to	game	theory	.
this	wo	n't	hurt	.	okay	.
it	's	about	zero	-	sum	and	non	-	zero	-	sum	games	.
if	you	ask	what	kind	of	a	situation	is	conducive	to	people	becoming	friends	and	allies	,	the	technical	answer	is	a	non	-	zero	-	sum	situation	.
and	if	you	ask	what	kind	of	situation	is	conducive	to	people	defining	people	as	enemies	,	it	's	a	zero	-	sum	situation	.
so	,	what	do	those	terms	mean	?
basically	,	a	zero	-	sum	game	is	the	kind	you	're	used	to	in	sports	,	where	there	's	a	winner	and	a	loser	.
so	,	their	fortunes	add	up	to	zero	.
so	,	in	tennis	,	every	point	is	either	good	for	you	and	bad	for	the	other	person	,	or	good	for	them	,	bad	for	you	.
either	way	,	your	fortunes	add	up	to	zero	.	that	's	a	zero	-	sum	game	.
now	,	if	you	're	playing	doubles	,	then	the	person	on	your	side	of	the	net	is	in	a	non	-	zero	-	sum	relationship	with	you	,	because	every	point	is	either	good	for	both	of	you	--	positive	,	win	-	win	--	or	bad	for	both	of	you	,	it	's	lose	-	lose	.
that	's	a	non	-	zero	-	sum	game	.
and	in	real	life	,	there	are	lots	of	non	-	zero	-	sum	games	.
in	the	realm	of	economics	,	say	,	if	you	buy	something	:	that	means	you	'd	rather	have	the	merchandise	than	the	money	,	but	the	merchant	would	rather	have	the	money	than	the	merchandise	.
you	both	feel	you	've	won	.
in	a	war	,	two	allies	are	playing	a	non	-	zero	-	sum	game	.
it	's	going	to	either	be	win	-	win	or	lose	-	lose	for	them	.
so	,	there	are	lots	of	non	-	zero	-	sum	games	in	real	life	.
and	you	could	basically	reformulate	what	i	said	earlier	,	about	how	compassion	is	deployed	and	the	golden	rule	is	deployed	,	by	just	saying	,	well	,	compassion	most	naturally	flows	along	non	-	zero	-	sum	channels	where	people	perceive	themselves	as	being	in	a	potentially	win	-	win	situation	with	some	of	their	friends	or	allies	.
the	deployment	of	the	golden	rule	most	naturally	happens	along	these	non	-	zero	-	sum	channels	.
so	,	kind	of	webs	of	non	-	zero	-	sumness	are	where	you	would	expect	compassion	and	the	golden	rule	to	kind	of	work	their	magic	.
with	zero	-	sum	channels	you	would	expect	something	else	.
okay	.	so	,	now	you	're	ready	for	the	good	news	that	i	said	might	save	the	world	.
and	now	i	can	admit	that	it	might	not	too	,	now	that	i	've	held	your	attention	for	three	minutes	of	technical	stuff	.
but	it	may	.	and	the	good	news	is	that	history	has	naturally	expanded	these	webs	of	non	-	zero	-	sumness	,	these	webs	that	can	be	these	channels	for	compassion	.
you	can	go	back	all	the	way	to	the	stone	age	:	technological	evolution	--	roads	,	the	wheel	,	writing	,	a	lot	of	transportation	and	communication	technologies	--	has	just	inexorably	made	it	so	that	more	people	can	be	in	more	non	-	zero	-	sum	relationships	with	more	and	more	people	at	greater	and	greater	distances	.
that	's	the	story	of	civilization	.
it	's	why	social	organization	has	grown	from	the	hunter	-	gatherer	village	to	the	ancient	state	,	the	empire	,	and	now	here	we	are	in	a	globalized	world	.
and	the	story	of	globalization	is	largely	a	story	of	non	-	zero	-	sumness	.
you	've	probably	heard	the	term	``	interdependence	``	applied	to	the	modern	world	.	well	,	that	's	just	another	term	for	non	-	zero	-	sum	.
if	your	fortunes	are	interdependent	with	somebody	,	then	you	live	in	a	non	-	zero	-	sum	relationship	with	them	.
and	you	see	this	all	the	time	in	the	modern	world	.
you	saw	it	with	the	recent	economic	crash	,	where	bad	things	happen	in	the	economy	--	bad	for	everybody	,	for	much	of	the	world	.
good	things	happen	,	and	it	's	good	for	much	of	the	world	.
and	,	you	know	,	i	'm	happy	to	say	,	i	think	there	's	really	evidence	that	this	non	-	zero	-	sum	kind	of	connection	can	expand	the	moral	compass	.
i	mean	,	if	you	look	at	the	american	attitudes	toward	japanese	during	world	war	ii	--	look	at	the	depictions	of	japanese	in	the	american	media	as	just	about	subhuman	,	and	look	at	the	fact	that	we	dropped	atomic	bombs	,	really	without	giving	it	much	of	a	thought	--
and	you	compare	that	to	the	attitude	now	,	i	think	part	of	that	is	due	to	a	kind	of	economic	interdependence	.
any	form	of	interdependence	,	or	non	-	zero	-	sum	relationship	forces	you	to	acknowledge	the	humanity	of	people	.
so	,	i	think	that	's	good	.
and	the	world	is	full	of	non	-	zero	-	sum	dynamics	.
environmental	problems	,	in	many	ways	,	put	us	all	in	the	same	boat	.
and	there	are	non	-	zero	-	sum	relationships	that	maybe	people	are	n't	aware	of	.
for	example	,	probably	a	lot	of	american	christians	do	n't	think	of	themselves	as	being	in	a	non	-	zero	-	sum	relationship	with	muslims	halfway	around	the	world	,	but	they	really	are	,	because	if	these	muslims	become	happier	and	happier	with	their	place	in	the	world	and	feel	that	they	have	a	place	in	it	,	that	's	good	for	americans	,	because	there	will	be	fewer	terrorists	to	threaten	american	security	.
if	they	get	less	and	less	happy	,	that	will	be	bad	for	americans	.
so	,	there	's	plenty	of	non	-	zero	-	sumness	.
and	so	,	the	question	is	:	if	there	's	so	much	non	-	zero	-	sumness	,	why	has	the	world	not	yet	been	suffused	in	love	,	peace	,	and	understanding	?
the	answer	's	complicated	.	it	's	the	occasion	for	a	whole	other	talk	.	certainly	,	a	couple	of	things	are	that	,	first	of	all	,	there	are	a	lot	of	zero	-	sum	situations	in	the	world	.
and	also	,	sometimes	people	do	n't	recognize	the	non	-	zero	-	sum	dynamics	in	the	world	.
in	both	of	these	areas	,	i	think	politicians	can	play	a	role	.
this	is	n't	only	about	religion	.
i	think	politicians	can	help	foster	non	-	zero	-	sum	relationships	,	economic	engagement	is	generally	better	than	blockades	and	so	on	,	in	this	regard	.
and	politicians	can	be	aware	,	and	should	be	aware	that	,
when	people	around	the	world	are	looking	at	them	,	are	looking	at	their	nation	and	picking	up	their	cues	for	whether	they	are	in	a	zero	-	sum	or	a	non	-	zero	-	sum	relationship	with	a	nation	--
like	,	say	,	america	,	or	any	other	nation	--	human	psychology	is	such	that	they	use	cues	like	:	do	we	feel	we	're	being	respected	?
because	,	you	know	,	historically	,	if	you	're	not	being	respected	,	you	're	probably	not	going	to	wind	up	in	a	non	-	zero	-	sum	,	mutually	profitable	relationship	with	people	.
so	,	we	need	to	be	aware	of	what	kind	of	signals	we	're	sending	out	.
and	some	of	this	,	again	,	is	in	the	realm	of	political	work	.
if	there	's	one	thing	i	can	encourage	everyone	to	do	,	politicians	,	religious	leaders	,	and	us	,	it	would	be	what	i	call	``	expanding	the	moral	imagination	``	--
that	is	to	say	,	your	ability	to	put	yourself	in	the	shoes	of	people	in	very	different	circumstances	.
this	is	not	the	same	as	compassion	,	but	it	's	conducive	to	compassion	.	it	opens	the	channels	for	compassion	.
and	i	'm	afraid	we	have	another	good	news	/	bad	news	story	,	which	is	that	the	moral	imagination	is	part	of	human	nature	.
that	's	good	,	but	again	we	tend	to	deploy	it	selectively	.
once	we	define	somebody	as	an	enemy	,	we	have	trouble	putting	ourselves	in	their	shoes	,	just	naturally	.
so	,	if	you	want	to	take	a	particularly	hard	case	for	an	american	:	somebody	in	iran	who	is	burning	an	american	flag	,	and	you	see	them	on	tv	.
well	,	the	average	american	is	going	to	resist	the	moral	exercise	of	putting	themselves	in	that	person	's	head	and	is	going	to	resist	the	idea	that	they	have	much	in	common	with	that	person	.
and	if	you	tell	them	,	``	well	,	they	think	america	disrespects	them	and	even	wants	to	dominate	them	,	and	they	hate	america	.
has	there	ever	been	somebody	who	disrespected	you	so	much	that	you	kind	of	hated	them	briefly	``	?
you	know	,	they	'll	resist	that	comparison	and	that	's	natural	,	that	's	human	.
and	,	similarly	,	the	person	in	iran	:	when	you	try	to	humanize	somebody	in	america	who	said	that	islam	is	evil	,
they	'll	have	trouble	with	that	.
so	,	it	's	a	very	difficult	thing	to	get	people	to	expand	the	moral	imagination	to	a	place	it	does	n't	naturally	go	.
i	think	it	's	worth	the	trouble	because	,	again	,	it	just	helps	us	to	understand	.	if	you	want	to	reduce	the	number	of	people	who	are	burning	flags	,	it	helps	to	understand	what	makes	them	do	it	.
and	i	think	it	's	good	moral	exercise	.
i	would	say	here	is	where	religious	leaders	come	in	,	because	religious	leaders	are	good	at	reframing	issues	for	people	,	at	harnessing	the	emotional	centers	of	the	brain	to	get	people	to	alter	their	awareness	and	reframe	the	way	they	think	.
i	mean	,	religious	leaders	are	kind	of	in	the	inspiration	business	.
it	's	their	great	calling	right	now	,	to	get	people	all	around	the	world	better	at	expanding	their	moral	imaginations	,	appreciating	that	in	so	many	ways	they	're	in	the	same	boat	.
i	would	just	sum	up	the	way	things	look	,	at	least	from	this	secular	perspective	,	as	far	as	compassion	and	the	golden	rule	go	,	by	saying	that	it	's	good	news	that	compassion	and	the	golden	rule	are	in	some	sense	built	into	human	nature	.
it	's	unfortunate	that	they	tend	to	be	selectively	deployed	.
and	it	's	going	to	take	real	work	to	change	that	.
but	,	nobody	ever	said	that	doing	god	's	work	was	going	to	be	easy	.	thanks	.
