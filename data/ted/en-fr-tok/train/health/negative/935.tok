i	was	one	of	the	founding	members	of	the	axis	of	evil	comedy	tour	.
the	other	founding	members	included	ahmed	ahmed	,	who	is	an	egyptian	-	american	,	who	actually	had	the	idea	to	go	to	the	middle	east	and	try	it	out	.
before	we	went	out	as	a	tour	,	he	went	out	solo	and	did	it	first	.
then	there	was	aron	kader	,	who	was	the	palestinian	-	american	.
and	then	there	was	me	,	the	iranian	-	american	of	the	group	.
now	,	being	iranian	-	american	presents	its	own	set	of	problems	,	as	you	know	.
those	two	countries	are	n't	getting	along	these	days	.
so	it	causes	a	lot	of	inner	conflict	,	you	know	,	like	part	of	me	likes	me	,	part	of	me	hates	me	.
part	of	me	thinks	i	should	have	a	nuclear	program	,	the	other	part	thinks	i	ca	n't	be	trusted	with	one	.
these	are	dilemmas	i	have	every	day	.
but	i	was	born	in	iran	;	i	'm	now	an	american	citizen	,	which	means	i	have	the	american	passport	,	which	means	i	can	travel	.
because	if	you	only	have	the	iranian	passport	,	you	're	kind	of	limited	to	the	countries	you	can	go	to	with	open	arms	,	you	know	--	syria	,	venezuela	,	north	korea	.
so	anyone	who	's	gotten	their	passport	in	america	will	tell	you	,	when	you	get	your	passport	,	it	still	says	what	country	you	were	born	in	.
so	i	remember	getting	my	american	passport	.
i	was	like	,	``	woohoo	!	i	'm	going	to	travel	.	``
and	i	opened	it	up	,	it	said	,	``	born	in	iran	.	``	i	'm	like	,	``	oh	,	come	on	,	man	.	``
``	i	'm	trying	to	go	places	.	``
but	what	's	interesting	is	,	i	've	never	had	trouble	traveling	in	any	other	western	countries	with	my	american	passport	,	even	though	it	says	,	``	born	in	iran	.	``	no	problems	.
where	i	've	had	some	problems	is	some	of	the	arab	countries	,	because	i	guess	some	of	the	arab	countries	are	n't	getting	along	with	iran	either	.
and	so	i	was	in	kuwait	recently	,	doing	a	comedy	show	with	some	other	american	comedians	.
they	all	went	through	,	and	then	the	border	patrol	saw	my	american	passport	.
``	ah	ha	!	american	,	great	.	``
then	he	opened	it	up	.	``	born	in	iran	?	wait	.	``
and	he	started	asking	me	questions	.
he	said	,	``	what	is	your	father	's	name	?	``
i	said	,	``	well	,	he	's	passed	away	,	but	his	name	was	khosro	.	``
he	goes	,	``	what	is	your	grandfather	's	name	?	``
i	said	,	``	he	passed	away	a	long	time	ago	.
his	name	was	jabbar	.	``
he	says	,	``	you	wait	.	i	'll	be	back	,	``	and	he	walked	away	.
and	i	started	freaking	out	,	because	i	do	n't	know	what	kind	of	crap	my	grandfather	was	into	.
thought	the	guy	was	going	to	come	back	and	be	like	,	``	we	've	been	looking	for	you	for	200	years	.	``
``	your	grandfather	has	a	parking	violation	.	it	's	way	overdue	.
you	owe	us	two	billion	dollars	.	``
but	as	you	can	see	,	when	i	talk	,	i	speak	with	an	american	accent	,	which	you	would	think	as	an	iranian	-	american	actor	,	i	should	be	able	to	play	any	part	,	good	,	bad	,	what	have	you	.
but	a	lot	of	times	in	hollywood	,	when	casting	directors	find	out	you	're	of	middle	eastern	descent	,	they	go	,	``	oh	,	you	're	iranian	.	great	.
can	you	say	'	i	will	kill	you	in	the	name	of	allah	?	'	``	``	i	could	say	that	,	but	what	if	i	were	to	say	,	'	hello	.	i	'm	your	doctor	?	'	``
they	go	,	``	great	.	and	then	you	hijack	the	hospital	.	``
like	i	think	you	're	missing	the	point	here	.
do	n't	get	me	wrong	,	i	do	n't	mind	playing	bad	guys	.
i	want	to	play	a	bad	guy	.	i	want	to	rob	a	bank	.
i	want	to	rob	a	bank	in	a	film	.	i	want	to	rob	a	bank	in	a	film	,	but	do	it	with	a	gun	,	with	a	gun	,	not	with	a	bomb	strapped	around	me	,	right	.
because	i	imagine	the	director	:	``	maz	,	i	think	your	character	would	rob	the	bank	with	a	bomb	around	him	.	``
``	why	would	i	do	that	?
if	i	want	the	money	,	why	would	i	kill	myself	?	``
right	.
``	gim	me	all	your	money	,	or	i	'll	blow	myself	up	.	``
``	well	,	then	blow	yourself	up	.
just	do	it	outside	,	please	.	``
but	the	fact	is	,	there	's	good	people	everywhere	.
that	's	what	i	try	and	show	in	my	stand	-	up	.	there	's	good	people	everywhere	.
all	it	takes	in	one	person	to	mess	it	up	.	like	a	couple	months	ago	in	times	square	in	new	york	,	there	was	this	pakistani	muslim	guy	who	tried	to	blow	up	a	car	bomb	.
now	,	i	happened	to	be	in	times	square	that	night	doing	a	comedy	show	.
and	a	few	months	before	that	,	there	was	a	white	american	guy	in	austin	,	texas	who	flew	his	airplane	into	the	irs	building	,	and	i	happened	to	be	in	austin	that	day	doing	a	stand	-	up	comedy	show	.
now	i	'll	tell	you	,	as	a	middle	eastern	male	,	when	you	show	up	around	a	lot	of	these	activities	,	you	start	feeling	guilty	at	one	point	.
i	was	watching	the	news	.	i	'm	like	,	``	am	i	involved	in	this	crap	?	``
``	i	did	n't	get	the	memo	.	what	's	going	on	?	``
but	what	was	interesting	was	,	the	pakistani	muslim	guy	--	see	he	gives	a	bad	name	to	muslims	and	middle	easterners	and	pakistanis	from	all	over	the	world	.
and	one	thing	that	happened	there	was	also	the	pakistani	taliban	took	credit	for	that	failed	car	bombing	.
my	question	is	:	why	would	you	take	credit	for	a	failed	car	bombing	?
``	we	just	wanted	to	say	we	tried	.	``
``	and	furthermore	,	it	is	the	thought	that	counts	.	``
``	and	in	conclusion	,	win	some	,	lose	some	.	``
but	what	happened	was	,	when	the	white	guy	flew	his	plane	into	the	building	,	i	know	all	my	middle	eastern	and	muslim	friends	in	the	states	were	watching	tv	,	going	,	``	please	,	do	n't	be	middle	eastern	.
do	n't	be	hassan	.	do	n't	be	hussein	.	``
and	the	name	came	out	jack	.	i	'm	like	,	``	woooo	!
that	's	not	one	of	us	.	``
but	i	kept	watching	the	news	in	case	they	came	back	,	they	were	like	,	``	before	he	did	it	,	he	converted	to	islam	.	``
``	damn	it	!	why	jack	?	why	?	``
but	the	fact	is	,	i	've	been	lucky	to	get	a	chance	to	perform	all	over	the	world	,	and	i	did	a	lot	of	shows	in	the	middle	east	.
i	just	did	a	seven	-	country	solo	tour	.
i	was	in	oman	,	and	i	was	in	saudi	arabia	.
i	was	in	dubai	.
and	it	's	great	,	there	's	good	people	everywhere	.
and	you	learn	great	things	about	these	places	.
i	encourage	people	always	to	go	visit	these	places	.
for	example	,	dubai	--	cool	place	.
they	're	obsessed	with	having	the	biggest	,	tallest	,	longest	,	as	we	all	know	.
they	have	a	mall	there	,	the	dubai	mall	.
it	is	so	big	,	they	have	taxis	in	the	mall	.
i	was	walking	.	i	heard	``	beep	,	beep	.	``
i	'm	like	,	``	what	are	you	doing	here	?	``
he	goes	,	``	i	'm	going	to	the	zara	store	.	it	's	three	miles	away	.
and	what	's	crazy	--	there	's	a	recession	going	on	,	even	in	dubai	,	but	you	would	n't	know	by	the	prices	.
like	in	the	dubai	mall	,	they	sell	frozen	yogurt	by	the	gram	.
it	's	like	a	drug	deal	.
i	was	walking	by	.	the	guy	goes	,	``	psst	.	habibi	,	my	friend	.	``
``	you	want	some	frozen	yogurt	?
come	here	.	come	here	.	come	here	.
i	have	one	gram	,	five	gram	,	10	gram	.	how	many	gram	do	you	want	?	``
i	bought	five	grams	.	10	dollars	.	10	dollars	!	i	said	,	``	what	's	in	this	?	``
he	's	like	,	``	good	stuff	,	man	.	columbian	.	top	of	the	line	.	top	of	the	line	.	``	the	other	thing	you	learn	sometimes	when	you	travel	to	these	countries	in	the	middle	east	,	sometimes	in	latin	american	countries	,	south	american	countries	--	a	lot	of	times	when	they	build	stuff	,	there	's	no	rules	and	regulations	.
for	example	,	i	took	my	two	year	-	old	son	to	the	playground	at	the	dubai	mall	.
and	i	've	taken	my	two	year	-	old	son	to	playgrounds	all	over	the	united	states	.
and	when	you	put	your	two	year	-	old	on	a	slide	in	the	united	states	,	they	put	something	on	the	slide	to	slow	the	kid	down	as	he	comes	down	the	slide	.
not	in	the	middle	east	.
i	put	my	two	year	-	old	on	the	slide	;	he	went	frrmrmm	!	he	took	off	.	i	went	down	.	i	go	,	``	where	's	my	son	?	``
``	on	the	third	floor	,	sir	.	on	the	third	floor	.	``
``	you	take	a	taxi	.	you	go	to	zara	.	make	a	left	.	``
``	try	the	yogurt	.	it	's	very	good	.	little	expensive	.	``
but	one	of	the	things	i	try	to	do	with	my	stand	-	up	is	to	break	stereotypes	.
and	i	've	been	guilty	of	stereotyping	as	well	.
i	was	in	dubai	.	and	there	's	a	lot	of	indians	who	work	in	dubai	.
and	they	do	n't	get	paid	that	well	.
and	i	got	it	in	my	head	that	all	the	indians	there	must	be	workers	.
and	i	forgot	there	's	obviously	successful	indians	in	dubai	as	well	.
i	was	doing	a	show	,	and	they	said	,	``	we	're	going	to	send	a	driver	to	pick	you	up	.	``
so	i	went	down	to	the	lobby	,	and	i	saw	this	indian	guy	.
i	go	,	``	he	's	got	to	be	my	driver	.	``
because	he	was	standing	there	in	like	a	cheap	suit	,	thin	mustache	,	staring	at	me	.
so	i	went	over	,	``	excuse	me	,	sir	,	are	you	my	driver	?	``
he	goes	,	``	no	,	sir	.	i	own	the	hotel	.	``
i	go	,	``	i	'm	sorry	.	then	why	were	you	staring	at	me	?	``
he	goes	,	``	i	thought	you	were	my	driver	.	``
i	'll	leave	you	guys	with	this	:	i	try	,	with	my	stand	-	up	,	to	break	stereotypes	,	present	middle	easterners	in	a	positive	light	--	muslims	in	a	positive	light	--	and	i	hope	that	in	the	coming	years	,	more	film	and	television	programs	come	out	of	hollywood	presenting	us	in	a	positive	light	.
who	knows	,	maybe	one	day	we	'll	even	have	our	own	james	bond	,	right	.
``	my	name	is	bond	,	jamal	bond	.	``
til	then	,	i	'll	keep	telling	jokes	.	i	hope	you	keep	laughing	.
