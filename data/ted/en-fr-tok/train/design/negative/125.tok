i	do	two	things	:	i	design	mobile	computers	and	i	study	brains	.
and	today	's	talk	is	about	brains	and	,	yay	,	somewhere	i	have	a	brain	fan	out	there	.
i	'm	going	to	,	if	i	can	have	my	first	slide	up	here	,	and	you	'll	see	the	title	of	my	talk	and	my	two	affiliations	.
so	what	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	is	why	we	do	n't	have	a	good	brain	theory	,	why	it	is	important	that	we	should	develop	one	and	what	we	can	do	about	it	.
and	i	'll	try	to	do	all	that	in	20	minutes	.	i	have	two	affiliations	.
most	of	you	know	me	from	my	palm	and	handspring	days	,	but	i	also	run	a	nonprofit	scientific	research	institute	called	the	redwood	neuroscience	institute	in	menlo	park	,	and	we	study	theoretical	neuroscience	,	and	we	study	how	the	neocortex	works	.
i	'm	going	to	talk	all	about	that	.
i	have	one	slide	on	my	other	life	,	the	computer	life	,	and	that	's	the	slide	here	.
these	are	some	of	the	products	i	've	worked	on	over	the	last	20	years	,	starting	back	from	the	very	original	laptop	to	some	of	the	first	tablet	computers	and	so	on	,	and	ending	up	most	recently	with	the	treo	,	and	we	're	continuing	to	do	this	.
and	i	've	done	this	because	i	really	believe	that	mobile	computing	is	the	future	of	personal	computing	,	and	i	'm	trying	to	make	the	world	a	little	bit	better	by	working	on	these	things	.
but	this	was	,	i	have	to	admit	,	all	an	accident	.
i	really	did	n't	want	to	do	any	of	these	products	and	very	early	in	my	career	i	decided	i	was	not	going	to	be	in	the	computer	industry	.
and	before	i	tell	you	about	that	,	i	just	have	to	tell	you	this	one	little	picture	of	graffiti	there	i	picked	off	the	web	the	other	day	.
i	was	looking	for	a	picture	of	graffiti	,	little	text	input	language	,	and	i	found	the	website	dedicated	to	teachers	who	want	to	make	these	,	you	know	,	the	script	writing	things	across	the	top	of	their	blackboard	,	and	they	had	added	graffiti	to	it	,	and	i	'm	sorry	about	that	.
so	what	happened	was	,	when	i	was	young	and	got	out	of	engineering	school	at	cornell	in	'79	,	i	decided	--	i	went	to	work	for	intel	and
i	was	in	the	computer	industry	--	and	three	months	into	that	,	i	fell	in	love	with	something	else	,	and	i	said	,	``	i	made	the	wrong	career	choice	here	,	``	and	i	fell	in	love	with	brains	.
this	is	not	a	real	brain	.	this	is	a	picture	of	one	,	a	line	drawing	.
but	i	do	n't	remember	exactly	how	it	happened	,	but	i	have	one	recollection	,	which	was	pretty	strong	in	my	mind	.
in	september	1979	,	scientific	american	came	out	with	a	single	topic	issue	about	the	brain	.	and	it	was	quite	good	.
it	was	one	of	the	best	issues	ever	.	and	they	talked	about	the	neuron	and	development	and	disease	and	vision	and	all	the	things	you	might	want	to	know	about	brains	.	it	was	really	quite	impressive	.
and	one	might	have	the	impression	that	we	really	knew	a	lot	about	brains	.
but	the	last	article	in	that	issue	was	written	by	francis	crick	of	dna	fame	.
today	is	,	i	think	,	the	50th	anniversary	of	the	discovery	of	dna	.
and	he	wrote	a	story	basically	saying	,	well	,	this	is	all	well	and	good	,	but	you	know	what	,	we	do	n't	know	diddley	squat	about	brains	and	no	one	has	a	clue	how	these	things	work	,	so	do	n't	believe	what	anyone	tells	you	.
this	is	a	quote	from	that	article	.	he	said	,	``	what	is	conspicuously	lacking	,	``	he	's	a	very	proper	british	gentleman	so	,	``	what	is	conspicuously	lacking	is	a	broad	framework	of	ideas	in	which	to	interpret	these	different	approaches	.	``
i	thought	the	word	framework	was	great	.
he	did	n't	say	we	did	n't	even	have	a	theory	.	he	says	,	we	do	n't	even	know	how	to	begin	to	think	about	it	--	we	do	n't	even	have	a	framework	.
we	are	in	the	pre	-	paradigm	days	,	if	you	want	to	use	thomas	kuhn	.
and	so	i	fell	in	love	with	this	,	and	said	look	,	we	have	all	this	knowledge	about	brains	.	how	hard	can	it	be	?
and	this	is	something	we	can	work	on	my	lifetime	.	i	felt	i	could	make	a	difference	,	and	so	i	tried	to	get	out	of	the	computer	business	,	into	the	brain	business	.
first	,	i	went	to	mit	,	the	ai	lab	was	there	,	and	i	said	,	well	,	i	want	to	build	intelligent	machines	,	too	,	but	the	way	i	want	to	do	it	is	to	study	how	brains	work	first	.
and	they	said	,	oh	,	you	do	n't	need	to	do	that	.
we	're	just	going	to	program	computers	;	that	's	all	we	need	to	do	.
and	i	said	,	no	,	you	really	ought	to	study	brains	.	they	said	,	oh	,	you	know	,	you	're	wrong	.	and	i	said	,	no	,	you	're	wrong	,	and	i	did	n't	get	in	.
but	i	was	a	little	disappointed	--	pretty	young	--	but	i	went	back	again	a	few	years	later	and	this	time	was	in	california	,	and	i	went	to	berkeley	.
and	i	said	,	i	'll	go	in	from	the	biological	side	.
so	i	got	in	--	in	the	ph.d.	program	in	biophysics	,	and	i	was	,	all	right	,
i	'm	studying	brains	now	,	and	i	said	,	well	,	i	want	to	study	theory	.
and	they	said	,	oh	no	,	you	ca	n't	study	theory	about	brains	.
that	's	not	something	you	do	.	you	ca	n't	get	funded	for	that	.
and	as	a	graduate	student	,	you	ca	n't	do	that	.	so	i	said	,	oh	my	gosh	.
i	was	very	depressed	.	i	said	,	but	i	can	make	a	difference	in	this	field	.
so	what	i	did	is	i	went	back	in	the	computer	industry	and	said	,	well	,	i	'll	have	to	work	here	for	a	while	,	do	something	.
that	's	when	i	designed	all	those	computer	products	.
and	i	said	,	i	want	to	do	this	for	four	years	,	make	some	money	,	like	i	was	having	a	family	,	and	i	would	mature	a	bit	,	and	maybe	the	business	of	neuroscience	would	mature	a	bit	.
well	,	it	took	longer	than	four	years	.	it	's	been	about	16	years	.
but	i	'm	doing	it	now	,	and	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	about	it	.
so	why	should	we	have	a	good	brain	theory	?
well	,	there	's	lots	of	reasons	people	do	science	.
one	is	--	the	most	basic	one	is	--	people	like	to	know	things	.
we	're	curious	,	and	we	just	go	out	and	get	knowledge	,	you	know	?
why	do	we	study	ants	?	well	,	it	's	interesting	.
maybe	we	'll	learn	something	really	useful	about	it	,	but	it	's	interesting	and	fascinating	.
but	sometimes	,	a	science	has	some	other	attributes	which	makes	it	really	,	really	interesting	.
sometimes	a	science	will	tell	something	about	ourselves	,	it	'll	tell	us	who	we	are	.
rarely	,	you	know	:	evolution	did	this	and	copernicus	did	this	,	where	we	have	a	new	understanding	of	who	we	are	.
and	after	all	,	we	are	our	brains	.	my	brain	is	talking	to	your	brain	.
our	bodies	are	hanging	along	for	the	ride	,	but	my	brain	is	talking	to	your	brain	.
and	if	we	want	to	understand	who	we	are	and	how	we	feel	and	perceive	,	we	really	understand	what	brains	are	.
another	thing	is	sometimes	science	leads	to	really	big	societal	benefits	and	technologies	,	or	businesses	,	or	whatever	,	that	come	out	of	it	.	and	this	is	one	,	too	,	because	when	we	understand	how	brains	work	,	we	're	going	to	be	able	to	build	intelligent	machines	,	and	i	think	that	's	actually	a	good	thing	on	the	whole	,	and	it	's	going	to	have	tremendous	benefits	to	society	,	just	like	a	fundamental	technology	.
so	why	do	n't	we	have	a	good	theory	of	brains	?
and	people	have	been	working	on	it	for	100	years	.
well	,	let	's	first	take	a	look	at	what	normal	science	looks	like	.
this	is	normal	science	.
normal	science	is	a	nice	balance	between	theory	and	experimentalists	.
and	so	the	theorist	guys	say	,	well	,	i	think	this	is	what	's	going	on	,	and	the	experimentalist	says	,	no	,	you	're	wrong	.
and	it	goes	back	and	forth	,	you	know	?
this	works	in	physics	.	this	works	in	geology	.	but	if	this	is	normal	science	,	what	does	neuroscience	look	like	?	this	is	what	neuroscience	looks	like	.
we	have	this	mountain	of	data	,	which	is	anatomy	,	physiology	and	behavior	.
you	ca	n't	imagine	how	much	detail	we	know	about	brains	.
there	were	28,000	people	who	went	to	the	neuroscience	conference	this	year	,	and	every	one	of	them	is	doing	research	in	brains	.
a	lot	of	data	.	but	there	's	no	theory	.	there	's	a	little	,	wimpy	box	on	top	there	.
and	theory	has	not	played	a	role	in	any	sort	of	grand	way	in	the	neurosciences	.
and	it	's	a	real	shame	.	now	why	has	this	come	about	?
if	you	ask	neuroscientists	,	why	is	this	the	state	of	affair	,	they	'll	first	of	all	admit	it	.	but	if	you	ask	them	,	they	'll	say	,	well	,	there	's	various	reasons	we	do	n't	have	a	good	brain	theory	.
some	people	say	,	well	,	we	do	n't	still	have	enough	data	,	we	need	to	get	more	information	,	there	's	all	these	things	we	do	n't	know	.
well	,	i	just	told	you	there	's	so	much	data	coming	out	your	ears	.
we	have	so	much	information	,	we	do	n't	even	know	how	to	begin	to	organize	it	.
what	good	is	more	going	to	do	?
maybe	we	'll	be	lucky	and	discover	some	magic	thing	,	but	i	do	n't	think	so	.
this	is	actually	a	symptom	of	the	fact	that	we	just	do	n't	have	a	theory	.
we	do	n't	need	more	data	--	we	need	a	good	theory	about	it	.
another	one	is	sometimes	people	say	,	well	,	brains	are	so	complex	,	it	'll	take	another	50	years	.
i	even	think	chris	said	something	like	this	yesterday	.
i	'm	not	sure	what	you	said	,	chris	,	but	something	like	,	well	,	it	's	one	of	the	most	complicated	things	in	the	universe	.	that	's	not	true	.
you	're	more	complicated	than	your	brain	.	you	've	got	a	brain	.
and	it	's	also	,	although	the	brain	looks	very	complicated	,	things	look	complicated	until	you	understand	them	.
that	's	always	been	the	case	.	and	so	all	we	can	say	,	well	,	my	neocortex	,	which	is	the	part	of	the	brain	i	'm	interested	in	,	has	30	billion	cells	.
but	,	you	know	what	?	it	's	very	,	very	regular	.
in	fact	,	it	looks	like	it	's	the	same	thing	repeated	over	and	over	and	over	again	.
it	's	not	as	complex	as	it	looks	.	that	's	not	the	issue	.
some	people	say	,	brains	ca	n't	understand	brains	.
very	zen	-	like	.	whoo	.
you	know	,	it	sounds	good	,	but	why	?	i	mean	,	what	's	the	point	?
it	's	just	a	bunch	of	cells	.	you	understand	your	liver	.
it	's	got	a	lot	of	cells	in	it	too	,	right	?
so	,	you	know	,	i	do	n't	think	there	's	anything	to	that	.
and	finally	,	some	people	say	,	well	,	you	know	,	i	do	n't	feel	like	a	bunch	of	cells	,	you	know	.	i	'm	conscious	.
i	've	got	this	experience	,	i	'm	in	the	world	,	you	know	.
i	ca	n't	be	just	a	bunch	of	cells	.	well	,	you	know	,
people	used	to	believe	there	was	a	life	force	to	be	living	,	and	we	now	know	that	's	really	not	true	at	all	.
and	there	's	really	no	evidence	that	says	--	well	,	other	than	people	just	have	disbelief	that	cells	can	do	what	they	do	.
and	so	,	if	some	people	have	fallen	into	the	pit	of	metaphysical	dualism	,	some	really	smart	people	,	too	,	but	we	can	reject	all	that	.
no	,	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	there	's	something	else	,	and	it	's	really	fundamental	,	and	this	is	what	it	is	:	there	's	another	reason	why	we	do	n't	have	a	good	brain	theory	,	and	it	's	because	we	have	an	intuitive	,	strongly	-	held	,	but	incorrect	assumption	that	has	prevented	us	from	seeing	the	answer	.
there	's	something	we	believe	that	just	,	it	's	obvious	,	but	it	's	wrong	.
now	,	there	's	a	history	of	this	in	science	and	before	i	tell	you	what	it	is	,	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	a	bit	about	the	history	of	it	in	science	.
you	look	at	some	other	scientific	revolutions	,	and	this	case	,	i	'm	talking	about	the	solar	system	,	that	's	copernicus	,	darwin	's	evolution	,	and	tectonic	plates	,	that	's	wegener	.
they	all	have	a	lot	in	common	with	brain	science	.
first	of	all	,	they	had	a	lot	of	unexplained	data	.	a	lot	of	it	.
but	it	got	more	manageable	once	they	had	a	theory	.
the	best	minds	were	stumped	--	really	,	really	smart	people	.
we	're	not	smarter	now	than	they	were	then	.
it	just	turns	out	it	's	really	hard	to	think	of	things	,	but	once	you	've	thought	of	them	,	it	's	kind	of	easy	to	understand	it	.
my	daughters	understood	these	three	theories	in	their	basic	framework	by	the	time	they	were	in	kindergarten	.
and	now	it	's	not	that	hard	,	you	know	,	here	's	the	apple	,	here	's	the	orange	,	you	know	,	the	earth	goes	around	,	that	kind	of	stuff	.
finally	,	another	thing	is	the	answer	was	there	all	along	,	but	we	kind	of	ignored	it	because	of	this	obvious	thing	,	and	that	's	the	thing	.
it	was	an	intuitive	,	strong	-	held	belief	that	was	wrong	.
in	the	case	of	the	solar	system	,	the	idea	that	the	earth	is	spinning	and	the	surface	of	the	earth	is	going	like	a	thousand	miles	an	hour	,	and	the	earth	is	going	through	the	solar	system	about	a	million	miles	an	hour	.
this	is	lunacy	.	we	all	know	the	earth	is	n't	moving	.
do	you	feel	like	you	're	moving	a	thousand	miles	an	hour	?
of	course	not	.	you	know	,	and	someone	who	said	,	well	,	it	was	spinning	around	in	space	and	it	's	so	huge	,	they	would	lock	you	up	,	and	that	's	what	they	did	back	then	.
so	it	was	intuitive	and	obvious	.	now	what	about	evolution	?
evolution	's	the	same	thing	.	we	taught	our	kids	,	well	,	the	bible	says	,	you	know	,	god	created	all	these	species	,	cats	are	cats	,	dogs	are	dogs	,	people	are	people	,	plants	are	plants	,	they	do	n't	change	.
noah	put	them	on	the	ark	in	that	order	,	blah	,	blah	,	blah	.	and	,	you	know	,
the	fact	is	,	if	you	believe	in	evolution	,	we	all	have	a	common	ancestor	,	and	we	all	have	a	common	ancestry	with	the	plant	in	the	lobby	.
this	is	what	evolution	tells	us	.	and	,	it	's	true	.	it	's	kind	of	unbelievable	.
and	the	same	thing	about	tectonic	plates	,	you	know	?
all	the	mountains	and	the	continents	are	kind	of	floating	around	on	top	of	the	earth	,	you	know	?	it	's	like	,	it	does	n't	make	any	sense	.
so	what	is	the	intuitive	,	but	incorrect	assumption	,	that	's	kept	us	from	understanding	brains	?
now	i	'm	going	to	tell	it	to	you	,	and	it	's	going	to	seem	obvious	that	that	is	correct	,	and	that	's	the	point	,	right	?	then	i	'm	going	to	have	to	make	an	argument	why	you	're	incorrect	about	the	other	assumption	.
the	intuitive	but	obvious	thing	is	that	somehow	intelligence	is	defined	by	behavior	,	that	we	are	intelligent	because	of	the	way	that	we	do	things	and	the	way	we	behave	intelligently	,	and	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	that	's	wrong	.
what	it	is	is	intelligence	is	defined	by	prediction	.
and	i	'm	going	to	work	you	through	this	in	a	few	slides	here	,	give	you	an	example	of	what	this	means	.	here	's	a	system	.
engineers	like	to	look	at	systems	like	this	.	scientists	like	to	look	at	systems	like	this	.
they	say	,	well	,	we	have	a	thing	in	a	box	,	and	we	have	its	inputs	and	its	outputs	.
the	ai	people	said	,	well	,	the	thing	in	the	box	is	a	programmable	computer	because	that	's	equivalent	to	a	brain	,	and	we	'll	feed	it	some	inputs	and	we	'll	get	it	to	do	something	,	have	some	behavior	.
and	alan	turing	defined	the	turing	test	,	which	is	essentially	saying	,	we	'll	know	if	something	's	intelligent	if	it	behaves	identical	to	a	human	.
a	behavioral	metric	of	what	intelligence	is	,	and	this	has	stuck	in	our	minds	for	a	long	period	of	time	.
reality	though	,	i	call	it	real	intelligence	.
real	intelligence	is	built	on	something	else	.
we	experience	the	world	through	a	sequence	of	patterns	,	and	we	store	them	,	and	we	recall	them	.	and	when	we	recall	them	,	we	match	them	up	against	reality	,	and	we	're	making	predictions	all	the	time	.
it	's	an	eternal	metric	.	there	's	an	eternal	metric	about	us	sort	of	saying	,	do	we	understand	the	world	?	am	i	making	predictions	?	and	so	on	.
you	're	all	being	intelligent	right	now	,	but	you	're	not	doing	anything	.
maybe	you	're	scratching	yourself	,	or	picking	your	nose	,	i	do	n't	know	,	but	you	're	not	doing	anything	right	now	,	but	you	're	being	intelligent	;	you	're	understanding	what	i	'm	saying	.
because	you	're	intelligent	and	you	speak	english	,	you	know	what	word	is	at	the	end	of	this	--
sentence	.
the	word	came	into	you	,	and	you	're	making	these	predictions	all	the	time	.
and	then	,	what	i	'm	saying	is	,	is	that	the	eternal	prediction	is	the	output	in	the	neocortex	.
and	that	somehow	,	prediction	leads	to	intelligent	behavior	.
and	here	's	how	that	happens	.	let	's	start	with	a	non	-	intelligent	brain	.
well	i	'll	argue	a	non	-	intelligent	brain	,	we	got	hold	of	an	old	brain	,	and	we	're	going	to	say	it	's	like	a	non	-	mammal	,	like	a	reptile	,	so	i	'll	say	,	an	alligator	;	we	have	an	alligator	.
and	the	alligator	has	some	very	sophisticated	senses	.
it	's	got	good	eyes	and	ears	and	touch	senses	and	so	on	,	a	mouth	and	a	nose	.	it	has	very	complex	behavior	.
it	can	run	and	hide	.	it	has	fears	and	emotions	.	it	can	eat	you	,	you	know	.
it	can	attack	.	it	can	do	all	kinds	of	stuff	.
but	we	do	n't	consider	the	alligator	very	intelligent	,	not	like	in	a	human	sort	of	way	.
but	it	has	all	this	complex	behavior	already	.
now	,	in	evolution	,	what	happened	?
first	thing	that	happened	in	evolution	with	mammals	,	we	started	to	develop	a	thing	called	the	neocortex	.
and	i	'm	going	to	represent	the	neocortex	here	,	by	this	box	that	's	sticking	on	top	of	the	old	brain	.
neocortex	means	new	layer	.	it	is	a	new	layer	on	top	of	your	brain	.
if	you	do	n't	know	it	,	it	's	the	wrinkly	thing	on	the	top	of	your	head	that	,	it	's	got	wrinkly	because	it	got	shoved	in	there	and	does	n't	fit	.
no	,	really	,	that	's	what	it	is	.	it	's	about	the	size	of	a	table	napkin	.
and	it	does	n't	fit	,	so	it	gets	all	wrinkly	.	now	look	at	how	i	've	drawn	this	here	.
the	old	brain	is	still	there	.	you	still	have	that	alligator	brain	.
you	do	.	it	's	your	emotional	brain	.
it	's	all	those	things	,	and	all	those	gut	reactions	you	have	.
and	on	top	of	it	,	we	have	this	memory	system	called	the	neocortex	.
and	the	memory	system	is	sitting	over	the	sensory	part	of	the	brain	.
and	so	as	the	sensory	input	comes	in	and	feeds	from	the	old	brain	,	it	also	goes	up	into	the	neocortex	.	and	the	neocortex	is	just	memorizing	.
it	's	sitting	there	saying	,	ah	,	i	'm	going	to	memorize	all	the	things	that	are	going	on	:	where	i	've	been	,	people	i	've	seen	,	things	i	've	heard	,	and	so	on	.
and	in	the	future	,	when	it	sees	something	similar	to	that	again	,	so	in	a	similar	environment	,	or	the	exact	same	environment	,	it	'll	play	it	back	.	it	'll	start	playing	it	back	.
oh	,	i	've	been	here	before	.	and	when	you	've	been	here	before	,	this	happened	next	.	it	allows	you	to	predict	the	future	.
it	allows	you	to	,	literally	it	feeds	back	the	signals	into	your	brain	;	they	'll	let	you	see	what	's	going	to	happen	next	,	will	let	you	hear	the	word	``	sentence	``	before	i	said	it	.
and	it	's	this	feeding	back	into	the	old	brain	that	'll	allow	you	to	make	very	more	intelligent	decisions	.
this	is	the	most	important	slide	of	my	talk	,	so	i	'll	dwell	on	it	a	little	bit	.
and	so	,	all	the	time	you	say	,	oh	,	i	can	predict	the	things	.
and	if	you	're	a	rat	and	you	go	through	a	maze	,	and	then	you	learn	the	maze	,	the	next	time	you	're	in	a	maze	,	you	have	the	same	behavior	,	but	all	of	a	sudden	,	you	're	smarter	because	you	say	,	oh	,	i	recognize	this	maze	,	i	know	which	way	to	go	,	i	've	been	here	before	,	i	can	envision	the	future	.	and	that	's	what	it	's	doing	.
in	humans	--	by	the	way	,	this	is	true	for	all	mammals	;
it	's	true	for	other	mammals	--	and	in	humans	,	it	got	a	lot	worse	.
in	humans	,	we	actually	developed	the	front	part	of	the	neocortex	called	the	anterior	part	of	the	neocortex	.	and	nature	did	a	little	trick	.
it	copied	the	posterior	part	,	the	back	part	,	which	is	sensory	,	and	put	it	in	the	front	part	.
and	humans	uniquely	have	the	same	mechanism	on	the	front	,	but	we	use	it	for	motor	control	.
so	we	are	now	able	to	make	very	sophisticated	motor	planning	,	things	like	that	.
i	do	n't	have	time	to	get	into	all	this	,	but	if	you	want	to	understand	how	a	brain	works	,	you	have	to	understand	how	the	first	part	of	the	mammalian	neocortex	works	,	how	it	is	we	store	patterns	and	make	predictions	.
so	let	me	give	you	a	few	examples	of	predictions	.
i	already	said	the	word	``	sentence	.	``	in	music	,	if	you	've	heard	a	song	before	,	if	you	heard	jill	sing	those	songs	before	,	when	she	sings	them	,	the	next	note	pops	into	your	head	already	--	you	anticipate	it	as	you	're	going	.	if	it	was	an	album	of	music	,	the	end	of	one	album	,	the	next	song	pops	into	your	head	.
and	these	things	happen	all	the	time	.	you	're	making	these	predictions	.
i	have	this	thing	called	the	altered	door	thought	experiment	.	and	the	altered	door	thought	experiment	says	,	you	have	a	door	at	home	,	and	when	you	're	here	,	i	'm	changing	it	,	i	've	got	a	guy	back	at	your	house	right	now	,	moving	the	door	around	,	and	they	're	going	to	take	your	doorknob	and	move	it	over	two	inches	.
and	when	you	go	home	tonight	,	you	're	going	to	put	your	hand	out	there	,	and	you	're	going	to	reach	for	the	doorknob	and	you	're	going	to	notice	it	's	in	the	wrong	spot	,	and	you	'll	go	,	whoa	,	something	happened	.
it	may	take	a	second	to	figure	out	what	it	was	,	but	something	happened	.
now	i	could	change	your	doorknob	in	other	ways	.
i	can	make	it	larger	or	smaller	,	i	can	change	its	brass	to	silver	,	i	could	make	it	a	lever	.	i	can	change	your	door	,	put	colors	on	;	i	can	put	windows	in	.	i	can	change	a	thousand	things	about	your	door	,	and	in	the	two	seconds	you	take	to	open	your	door	,	you	're	going	to	notice	that	something	has	changed	.
now	,	the	engineering	approach	to	this	,	the	ai	approach	to	this	,	is	to	build	a	door	database	.	it	has	all	the	door	attributes	.
and	as	you	go	up	to	the	door	,	you	know	,	let	's	check	them	off	one	at	time	.
door	,	door	,	door	,	you	know	,	color	,	you	know	what	i	'm	saying	.
we	do	n't	do	that	.	your	brain	does	n't	do	that	.
what	your	brain	is	doing	is	making	constant	predictions	all	the	time	about	what	is	going	to	happen	in	your	environment	.
as	i	put	my	hand	on	this	table	,	i	expect	to	feel	it	stop	.
when	i	walk	,	every	step	,	if	i	missed	it	by	an	eighth	of	an	inch	,	i	'll	know	something	has	changed	.
you	're	constantly	making	predictions	about	your	environment	.
i	'll	talk	about	vision	here	briefly	.	this	is	a	picture	of	a	woman	.
and	when	you	look	at	people	,	your	eyes	are	caught	over	at	two	to	three	times	a	second	.
you	're	not	aware	of	this	,	but	your	eyes	are	always	moving	.
and	so	when	you	look	at	someone	's	face	,	you	'd	typically	go	from	eye	to	eye	to	eye	to	nose	to	mouth	.
now	,	when	your	eye	moves	from	eye	to	eye	,	if	there	was	something	else	there	like	,	a	nose	,	you	'd	see	a	nose	where	an	eye	is	supposed	to	be	,	and	you	'd	go	,	oh	shit	,	you	know	--
there	's	something	wrong	about	this	person	.
and	that	's	because	you	're	making	a	prediction	.
it	's	not	like	you	just	look	over	there	and	say	,	what	am	i	seeing	now	?
a	nose	,	that	's	okay	.	no	,	you	have	an	expectation	of	what	you	're	going	to	see	.
every	single	moment	.	and	finally	,	let	's	think	about	how	we	test	intelligence	.
we	test	it	by	prediction	.	what	is	the	next	word	in	this	,	you	know	?
this	is	to	this	as	this	is	to	this	.	what	is	the	next	number	in	this	sentence	?
here	's	three	visions	of	an	object	.
what	's	the	fourth	one	?	that	's	how	we	test	it	.	it	's	all	about	prediction	.
so	what	is	the	recipe	for	brain	theory	?
first	of	all	,	we	have	to	have	the	right	framework	.
and	the	framework	is	a	memory	framework	,	not	a	computation	or	behavior	framework	.	it	's	a	memory	framework	.
how	do	you	store	and	recall	these	sequences	or	patterns	?	it	's	spatio	-	temporal	patterns	.
then	,	if	in	that	framework	,	you	take	a	bunch	of	theoreticians	.
now	biologists	generally	are	not	good	theoreticians	.
it	's	not	always	true	,	but	in	general	,	there	's	not	a	good	history	of	theory	in	biology	.
so	i	found	the	best	people	to	work	with	are	physicists	,	engineers	and	mathematicians	,	who	tend	to	think	algorithmically	.
then	they	have	to	learn	the	anatomy	,	and	they	've	got	to	learn	the	physiology	.
you	have	to	make	these	theories	very	realistic	in	anatomical	terms	.
anyone	who	gets	up	and	tells	you	their	theory	about	how	the	brain	works	and	does	n't	tell	you	exactly	how	it	's	working	in	the	brain	and	how	the	wiring	works	in	the	brain	,	it	is	not	a	theory	.
and	that	's	what	we	're	doing	at	the	redwood	neuroscience	institute	.
i	would	love	to	have	more	time	to	tell	you	we	're	making	fantastic	progress	in	this	thing	,	and	i	expect	to	be	back	up	on	this	stage	,	maybe	this	will	be	some	other	time	in	the	not	too	distant	future	and	tell	you	about	it	.
i	'm	really	,	really	excited	.	this	is	not	going	to	take	50	years	at	all	.
so	what	will	brain	theory	look	like	?
first	of	all	,	it	's	going	to	be	a	theory	about	memory	.
not	like	computer	memory	.	it	's	not	at	all	like	computer	memory	.
it	's	very	,	very	different	.	and	it	's	a	memory	of	these	very	high	-	dimensional	patterns	,	like	the	things	that	come	from	your	eyes	.
it	's	also	memory	of	sequences	.
you	can	not	learn	or	recall	anything	outside	of	a	sequence	.
a	song	must	be	heard	in	sequence	over	time	,	and	you	must	play	it	back	in	sequence	over	time	.
and	these	sequences	are	auto	-	associatively	recalled	,	so	if	i	see	something	,	i	hear	something	,	it	reminds	me	of	it	,	and	then	it	plays	back	automatically	.
it	's	an	automatic	playback	.	and	prediction	of	future	inputs	is	the	desired	output	.
and	as	i	said	,	the	theory	must	be	biologically	accurate	,	it	must	be	testable	,	and	you	must	be	able	to	build	it	.
if	you	do	n't	build	it	,	you	do	n't	understand	it	.	so	,	one	more	slide	here	.
what	is	this	going	to	result	in	?	are	we	going	to	really	build	intelligent	machines	?
absolutely	.	and	it	's	going	to	be	different	than	people	think	.
no	doubt	that	it	's	going	to	happen	,	in	my	mind	.
first	of	all	,	it	's	going	to	be	built	up	,	we	're	going	to	build	the	stuff	out	of	silicon	.
the	same	techniques	we	use	for	building	silicon	computer	memories	,	we	can	use	for	here	.
but	they	're	very	different	types	of	memories	.
and	we	're	going	to	attach	these	memories	to	sensors	,	and	the	sensors	will	experience	real	-	live	,	real	-	world	data	,	and	these	things	are	going	to	learn	about	their	environment	.
now	it	's	very	unlikely	the	first	things	you	're	going	to	see	are	like	robots	.
not	that	robots	are	n't	useful	and	people	can	build	robots	.
but	the	robotics	part	is	the	hardest	part	.	that	's	the	old	brain	.	that	's	really	hard	.
the	new	brain	is	actually	kind	of	easier	than	the	old	brain	.
so	the	first	thing	we	're	going	to	do	are	the	things	that	do	n't	require	a	lot	of	robotics	.
so	you	're	not	going	to	see	c	-	3po	.
you	're	going	to	more	see	things	like	,	you	know	,	intelligent	cars	that	really	understand	what	traffic	is	and	what	driving	is	and	have	learned	that	certain	types	of	cars	with	the	blinkers	on	for	half	a	minute	probably	are	n't	going	to	turn	,	things	like	that	.
we	can	also	do	intelligent	security	systems	.
anywhere	where	we	're	basically	using	our	brain	,	but	not	doing	a	lot	of	mechanics	.
those	are	the	things	that	are	going	to	happen	first	.
but	ultimately	,	the	world	's	the	limit	here	.
i	do	n't	know	how	this	is	going	to	turn	out	.
i	know	a	lot	of	people	who	invented	the	microprocessor	and	if	you	talk	to	them	,	they	knew	what	they	were	doing	was	really	significant	,	but	they	did	n't	really	know	what	was	going	to	happen	.
they	could	n't	anticipate	cell	phones	and	the	internet	and	all	this	kind	of	stuff	.
they	just	knew	like	,	hey	,	they	were	going	to	build	calculators	and	traffic	light	controllers	.	but	it	's	going	to	be	big	.
in	the	same	way	,	this	is	like	brain	science	and	these	memories	are	going	to	be	a	very	fundamental	technology	,	and	it	's	going	to	lead	to	very	unbelievable	changes	in	the	next	100	years	.
and	i	'm	most	excited	about	how	we	're	going	to	use	them	in	science	.
so	i	think	that	's	all	my	time	,	i	'm	over	it	,	and	i	'm	going	to	end	my	talk	right	there	.
