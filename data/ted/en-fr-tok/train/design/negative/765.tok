sadly	,	in	the	next	18	minutes	when	i	do	our	chat	,	four	americans	that	are	alive	will	be	dead	from	the	food	that	they	eat	.
my	name	's	jamie	oliver	.	i	'm	34	years	old	.
i	'm	from	essex	in	england	and	for	the	last	seven	years	i	've	worked	fairly	tirelessly	to	save	lives	in	my	own	way	.
i	'm	not	a	doctor	;
i	'm	a	chef	,	i	do	n't	have	expensive	equipment	or	medicine	.
i	use	information	,	education	.
i	profoundly	believe	that	the	power	of	food	has	a	primal	place	in	our	homes	that	binds	us	to	the	best	bits	of	life	.
we	have	an	awful	,	awful	reality	right	now	.
america	,	you	're	at	the	top	of	your	game	.
this	is	one	of	the	most	unhealthy	countries	in	the	world	.
can	i	please	just	see	a	raise	of	hands	for	how	many	of	you	have	children	in	this	room	today	?
please	put	your	hands	up	.
aunties	,	uncles	,	you	can	continue	to
put	your	hands	up	,	aunties	and	uncles	as	well	.
most	of	you	.	ok	.
we	,	the	adults	of	the	last	four	generations	,	have	blessed	our	children	with	the	destiny	of	a	shorter	lifespan	than	their	own	parents	.
your	child	will	live	a	life	ten	years	younger	than	you	because	of	the	landscape	of	food	that	we	've	built	around	them	.
two	-	thirds	of	this	room	,	today	,	in	america	,	are	statistically	overweight	or	obese	.
you	lot	,	you	're	all	right	,	but	we	'll	get	you	eventually	,	do	n't	worry	.
right	?
the	statistics	of	bad	health	are	clear	,	very	clear	.
we	spend	our	lives	being	paranoid	about	death	,	murder	,	homicide	,	you	name	it	;	it	's	on	the	front	page	of	every	paper	,	cnn	.
look	at	homicide	at	the	bottom	,	for	god	's	sake	.
right	?
every	single	one	of	those	in	the	red	is	a	diet	-	related	disease	.
any	doctor	,	any	specialist	will	tell	you	that	.
fact	:	diet	-	related	disease	is	the	biggest	killer	in	the	united	states	,	right	now	,	here	today	.
this	is	a	global	problem	.
it	's	a	catastrophe	.
it	's	sweeping	the	world	.
england	is	right	behind	you	,	as	usual	.
i	know	they	were	close	,	but	not	that	close	.
we	need	a	revolution	.
mexico	,	australia	,	germany	,	india	,	china	,	all	have	massive	problems	of	obesity	and	bad	health	.
think	about	smoking	.
it	costs	way	less	than	obesity	now	.
obesity	costs	you	americans	10	percent	of	your	healthcare	bills	,
150	billion	dollars	a	year	.
in	10	years	,	it	's	set	to	double	:
300	billion	dollars	a	year	.
and	let	's	be	honest	,	guys	,	you	ai	n't	got	that	cash	.
i	came	here	to	start	a	food	revolution	that	i	so	profoundly	believe	in	.
we	need	it	.	the	time	is	now	.
we	're	in	a	tipping	-	point	moment	.
i	've	been	doing	this	for	seven	years	.
i	've	been	trying	in	america	for	seven	years	.
now	is	the	time	when	it	's	ripe	--	ripe	for	the	picking	.
i	went	to	the	eye	of	the	storm	.
i	went	to	west	virginia	,	the	most	unhealthy	state	in	america	.
or	it	was	last	year	.
we	've	got	a	new	one	this	year	,	but	we	'll	work	on	that	next	season	.
huntington	,	west	virginia	.
beautiful	town	.
i	wanted	to	put	heart	and	soul	and	people	,	your	public	,	around	the	statistics	that	we	've	become	so	used	to	.
i	want	to	introduce	you	to	some	of	the	people	that	i	care	about	:
your	public	,	your	children	.
i	want	to	show	a	picture	of	my	friend	brittany	.
she	's	16	years	old	.
she	's	got	six	years	to	live	because	of	the	food	that	she	's	eaten	.
she	's	the	third	generation	of	americans	that	has	n't	grown	up	within	a	food	environment	where	they	've	been	taught	to	cook	at	home	or	in	school	,	or	her	mom	,	or	her	mom	's	mom	.
she	has	six	years	to	live	.
she	's	eating	her	liver	to	death	.
stacy	,	the	edwards	family	.
this	is	a	normal	family	,	guys	.
stacy	does	her	best	,	but	she	's	third	-	generation	as	well	;	she	was	never	taught	to	cook	at	home	or	in	school	.
the	family	's	obese	.
justin	here	,	12	years	old	,
he	's	350	pounds	.
he	gets	bullied	,	for	god	's	sake	.
the	daughter	there	,	katie	,	she	's	four	years	old	.
she	's	obese	before	she	even	gets	to	primary	school	.
marissa	,	she	's	all	right	,	she	's	one	of	your	lot	.
but	you	know	what	?	her	father	,	who	was	obese	,	died	in	her	arms	,
and	then	the	second	most	important	man	in	her	life	,	her	uncle	,	died	of	obesity	,
and	now	her	step	-	dad	is	obese	.
you	see	,	the	thing	is	obesity	and	diet	-	related	disease	does	n't	just	hurt	the	people	that	have	it	;	it	's	all	of	their	friends	,	families	,	brothers	,	sisters	.
pastor	steve	:
an	inspirational	man	,	one	of	my	early	allies	in	huntington	,	west	virginia	.
he	's	at	the	sharp	knife	-	edge	of	this	problem	.
he	has	to	bury	the	people	,	ok	?
and	he	's	fed	up	with	it	.	he	's	fed	up	with	burying	his	friends	,	his	family	,	his	community	.
come	winter	,	three	times	as	many	people	die	.
he	's	sick	of	it	.
this	is	preventable	disease	.	waste	of	life	.
by	the	way	,	this	is	what	they	get	buried	in	.
we	're	not	geared	up	to	do	this	.
ca	n't	even	get	them	out	the	door	--	and	i	'm	being	serious	--
ca	n't	even	get	them	there	.	forklift	.
ok	,	i	see	it	as	a	triangle	,	ok	?
this	is	our	landscape	of	food	.
i	need	you	to	understand	it	.
you	've	probably	heard	all	this	before	,	but	let	's	just	go	back	over	it	.
over	the	last	30	years	,	what	's	happened	that	's	ripped	the	heart	out	of	this	country	?
let	's	be	frank	and	honest	:
well	,	modern	-	day	life	.
let	's	start	with	the	main	street	.	fast	food	has	taken	over	the	whole	country	;	we	know	that	.
the	big	brands	are	some	of	the	most	important	powers	,	powerful	powers	,	in	this	country	.
supermarkets	as	well	.
big	companies	.	big	companies	.
thirty	years	ago	,	most	of	the	food	was	largely	local	and	largely	fresh	.
now	it	's	largely	processed	and	full	of	all	sorts	of	additives	,	extra	ingredients	,	and	you	know	the	rest	of	the	story	.
portion	size	is	obviously	a	massive	,	massive	problem	.
labeling	is	a	massive	problem	.
the	labeling	in	this	country	is	a	disgrace	.
they	want	to	be	self	--	they	want	to	self	-	police	themselves	.
the	industry	wants	to	self	-	police	themselves	.
what	,	in	this	kind	of	climate	?	they	do	n't	deserve	it	.
how	can	you	say	something	is	low	-	fat	when	it	's	full	of	so	much	sugar	?
home	.	the	biggest	problem	with	the	home	is	that	used	to	be	the	heart	of	passing	on	food	,	food	culture	,
what	made	our	society	.
that	ai	n't	happening	anymore	.
and	you	know	,	as	we	go	to	work	and	as	life	changes	,	and	as	life	always	evolves	,	we	kind	of	have	to	look	at	it	holistically	--	step	back	for	a	moment	,	and	re	-	address	the	balance	.
it	ai	n't	happening	,	has	n't	happened	for	30	years	,	ok	?
i	want	to	show	you	a	situation	that	is	very	normal	right	now	;	the	edwards	family	.
jamie	oliver	:	let	's	have	a	talk	.
this	stuff	goes	through	you	and	your	family	's	body	every	week	.
and	i	need	you	to	know	that	this	is	going	to	kill	your	children	early	.
how	are	you	feeling	?
stacy	:	just	feeling	really	sad	and	depressed	right	now	.
but	,	you	know	,	i	want	my	kids	to	succeed	in	life	and	this	is	n't	going	to	get	them	there	.
but	i	'm	killing	them	.
jo	:	yes	you	are	.	you	are	.
but	we	can	stop	that	.
normal	.	let	's	get	on	schools	,	something	that	i	'm	fairly	much	a	specialist	in	.
ok	,	school	.
what	is	school	?	who	invented	it	?	what	's	the	purpose	of	school	?
school	was	always	invented	to	arm	us	with	the	tools	to	make	us	creative	,	do	wonderful	things	,	make	us	earn	a	living	,	etc	.	,	etc	.	,	etc	.
you	know	,	it	's	been	kind	of	in	this	sort	of	tight	box	for	a	long	,	long	time	.
ok	?
but	we	have	n't	really	evolved	it	to	deal	with	the	health	catastrophes	of	america	,	ok	?
school	food	is	something	that	most	kids	--	31	million	a	day	,	actually	--	have	twice	a	day	,	more	than	often	,	breakfast	and	lunch	,	180	days	of	the	year	.
so	you	could	say	that	school	food	is	quite	important	,	really	,	judging	the	circumstances	.
before	i	crack	into	my	rant	,	which	i	'm	sure	you	're	waiting	for	...	i	need	to	say	one	thing	,	and	it	's	so	important	in	hopefully	the	magic	that	happens	and	unfolds	in	the	next	three	months	.
the	lunch	ladies	,	the	lunch	cooks	of	america	--	i	offer	myself	as	their	ambassador	.
i	'm	not	slacking	them	off	.
they	're	doing	the	best	they	can	do	.
they	're	doing	their	best	.
but	they	're	doing	what	they	're	told	,	and	what	they	're	being	told	to	do	is	wrong	.
the	system	is	highly	run	by	accountants	;
there	's	not	enough	,	or	any	,	food	-	knowledgeable	people	in	the	business	.
there	's	a	problem	:
if	you	're	not	a	food	expert	,	and	you	've	got	tight	budgets	and	it	's	getting	tighter	,	then	you	ca	n't	be	creative	,	you	ca	n't	duck	and	dive	and	write	different	things	around	things	.
if	you	're	an	accountant	,	and	a	box	-	ticker	,	the	only	thing	you	can	do	in	these	circumstances	is	buy	cheaper	shit	.
now	,	the	reality	is	,	the	food	that	your	kids	get	every	day	is	fast	food	,	it	's	highly	processed	,	there	's	not	enough	fresh	food	in	there	at	all	.
you	know	,	the	amount	of	additives	,	e	numbers	,	ingredients	you	would	n't	believe	--	there	's	not	enough	veggies	at	all	.	french	fries	are	considered	a	vegetable	.
pizza	for	breakfast	.	they	do	n't	even	get	given	crockery	.
knives	and	forks	?	no	,	they	're	too	dangerous	.
they	have	scissors	in	the	classroom	,	but	knives	and	forks	?	no	.
and	the	way	i	look	at	it	is	:	if	you	do	n't	have	knives	and	forks	in	your	school	,	you	're	purely	endorsing	,	from	a	state	level	,	fast	food	,	because	it	's	handheld	.
and	yes	,	by	the	way	,	it	is	fast	food	:	it	's	sloppy	joes	,	it	's	burgers	,	it	's	wieners	,	it	's	pizzas	,	it	's	all	of	that	stuff	.
ten	percent	of	what	we	spend	on	healthcare	,	as	i	said	earlier	,	is	on	obesity	,	and	it	's	going	to	double	.
we	're	not	teaching	our	kids	.
there	's	no	statutory	right	to	teach	kids	about	food	,	elementary	or	secondary	school	.	ok	?
we	do	n't	teach	kids	about	food	.	right	?
and	this	is	a	little	clip	from	an	elementary	school	,	which	is	very	common	in	england	.
video	:	who	knows	what	this	is	?
child	:	potatoes	.	jamie	oliver	:	potato	?	so	,	you	think	these	are	potatoes	?
do	you	know	what	that	is	?
do	you	know	what	that	is	?	child	:	broccoli	?
jo	:	what	about	this	?	our	good	old	friend	.
do	you	know	what	this	is	,	honey	?	child	:	celery	.
jo	:	no	.	what	do	you	think	this	is	?	child	:	onion	.	jo	:	onion	?	no	.
jamie	oliver	:	immediately	you	get	a	really	clear	sense	of	:	do	the	kids	know	anything	about	where	food	comes	from	?
video	:	jo	:	who	knows	what	that	is	?	child	:	uh	,	pear	?
jo	:	what	do	you	think	this	is	?	child	:	i	do	n't	know	.
jo	:	if	the	kids	do	n't	know	what	stuff	is	,	then	they	will	never	eat	it	.
jo	:	normal	.	england	and	america	,
england	and	america	.
guess	what	fixed	that	.	guess	what	fixed	that	:
two	one	-	hour	sessions	.
we	've	got	to	start	teaching	our	kids	about	food	in	schools	,	period	.
i	want	to	tell	you	about	something	,	i	want	to	tell	you	about	something	that	kind	of	epitomizes	the	trouble	that	we	're	in	,	guys	.	ok	?
i	want	to	talk	about	something	so	basic	as	milk	.
every	kid	has	the	right	to	milk	at	school	.
your	kids	will	be	having	milk	at	school	,	breakfast	and	lunch	.	right	?
they	'll	be	having	two	bottles	.	ok	?
and	most	kids	do	.
but	milk	ai	n't	good	enough	anymore	.	because	someone	at	the	milk	board	,	right	--	and	do	n't	get	me	wrong	,	i	support	milk	--	but	someone	at	the	milk	board	probably	paid	a	lot	of	money	for	some	geezer	to	work	out	that	if	you	put	loads	of	flavorings	and	colorings	and	sugar	in	milk	,	right	,	more	kids	will	drink	it	.	yeah	.
and	obviously	now	that	's	going	to	catch	on	.
the	apple	board	is	going	to	work	out	that	if	they	make	toffee	apples	they	'll	eat	more	apples	as	well	.
do	you	know	what	i	mean	?
for	me	,	there	ai	n't	no	need	to	flavor	the	milk	.
okay	?	there	's	sugar	in	everything	.
i	know	the	ins	and	outs	of	those	ingredients	.
it	's	in	everything	.	even	the	milk	has	n't	escaped	the	kind	of	modern	-	day	problems	.
there	's	our	milk	.	there	's	our	carton	.
in	that	is	nearly	as	much	sugar	as	one	of	your	favorite	cans	of	fizzy	pop	,
and	they	are	having	two	a	day	.
so	,	let	me	just	show	you	.
we	've	got	one	kid	,	here	,	having	,	you	know	,	eight	tablespoons	of	sugar	a	day	.
you	know	,	there	's	your	week	.
there	's	your	month	.
and	i	've	taken	the	liberty	of	putting	in	just	the	five	years	of	elementary	school	sugar	,	just	from	milk	.
now	,	i	do	n't	know	about	you	guys	,	but	judging	the	circumstances	,	right	,	any	judge	in	the	whole	world	,	would	look	at	the	statistics	and	the	evidence	,	and	they	would	find	any	government	of	old	guilty	of	child	abuse	.	that	's	my	belief	.
now	,	if	i	came	up	here	,	and	i	wish	i	could	come	up	here	today	and	hang	a	cure	for	aids	or	cancer	,	you	'd	be	fighting	and	scrambling	to	get	to	me	.
this	,	all	this	bad	news	,	is	preventable	.
that	's	the	good	news	.
it	's	very	,	very	preventable	.
so	,	let	's	just	think	about	,	we	got	a	problem	here	,	we	need	to	reboot	.
okay	so	,	in	my	world	,	what	do	we	need	to	do	?
here	is	the	thing	,	right	,
it	can	not	just	come	from	one	source	.
to	reboot	and	make	real	tangible	change	,	real	change	,	so	that	i	could	look	you	in	the	white	of	the	eyes	and	say	,	``	in	10	years	time	,	the	history	of	your	children	's	lives	,	happiness	--	and	let	's	not	forget	,	you	're	clever	if	you	eat	well	,	you	know	you	're	going	to	live	longer	--	all	of	that	stuff	,	it	will	look	different	.	ok	?	``	so	,	supermarkets	.
where	else	do	you	shop	so	religiously	?	week	in	,	week	out	.
how	much	money	do	you	spend	,	in	your	life	,	in	a	supermarket	?
love	them	.	they	just	sell	us	what	we	want	.	all	right	.
they	owe	us	,	to	put	a	food	ambassador	in	every	major	supermarket	.
they	need	to	help	us	shop	.	they	need	to	show	us	how	to	cook	quick	,	tasty	,	seasonal	meals	for	people	that	are	busy	.
this	is	not	expensive	.
it	is	done	in	some	,	and	it	needs	to	be	done	across	the	board	in	america	soon	,	and	quick	.
the	big	brands	,	you	know	,	the	food	brands	,	need	to	put	food	education	at	the	heart	of	their	businesses	.
i	know	,	easier	said	than	done	.
it	's	the	future	.	it	's	the	only	way	.
fast	food	.	with	the	fast	-	food	industry	you	know	,	it	's	very	competitive	.
i	've	had	loads	of	secret	papers	and	dealings	with	fast	food	restaurants	.
i	know	how	they	do	it	.
i	mean	basically	they	've	weaned	us	on	to	these	hits	of	sugar	,	salt	and	fat	,	and	x	,	y	,	and	z	,
and	everyone	loves	them	.	right	?
so	,	these	guys	are	going	to	be	part	of	the	solution	.
but	we	need	to	get	the	government	to	work	with	all	of	the	fast	food	purveyors	and	the	restaurant	industry	,
and	over	a	five	,	six	,	seven	year	period	wean	of	us	off	the	extreme	amounts	of	fat	,	sugar	,	fat	and	all	the	other	non	-	food	ingredients	.
now	,	also	,	back	to	the	sort	of	big	brands	:	labeling	,	i	said	earlier	,	is	an	absolute	farce
and	has	got	to	be	sorted	.
ok	,	school	.
obviously	in	schools	we	owe	it	to	them	to	make	sure	those	180	days	of	the	year	,	from	that	little	precious	age	of	four	,	til	18	,	20	,	24	,	whatever	,	they	need	to	be	cooked	proper	,	fresh	food	from	local	growers	on	site	.	ok	?
there	needs	to	be	a	new	standard	of	fresh	,	proper	food	for	your	children	.	yeah	?
under	the	circumstances	,	it	's	profoundly	important	that	every	single	american	child	leaves	school	knowing	how	to	cook	10	recipes	that	will	save	their	life	.
life	skills	.
that	means	that	they	can	be	students	,	young	parents	,	and	be	able	to	sort	of	duck	and	dive	around	the	basics	of	cooking	,	no	matter	what	recession	hits	them	next	time	.	if	you	can	cook	,	recession	money	does	n't	matter	.
if	you	can	cook	,	time	does	n't	matter	.
the	workplace	,	we	have	n't	really	talked	about	it	.
you	know	,	it	's	now	time	for	corporate	responsibility	to	really	look	at	what	they	feed	or	make	available	to	their	staff	.
the	staff	are	the	moms	and	dads	of	america	's	children	.
marissa	,	her	father	died	in	her	hand	,	i	think	she	'd	be	quite	happy	if	corporate	america	could	start	feeding	their	staff	properly	.
definitely	they	should	n't	be	left	out	.
let	's	go	back	to	the	home	.
now	,	look	,	if	we	do	all	this	stuff	,	and	we	can	,	it	's	so	achievable	.	you	can	care	and	be	commercial	.
absolutely	.
but	the	home	needs	to	start	passing	on	cooking	again	,	for	sure	.
for	sure	,	pass	it	on	as	a	philosophy	.
and	for	me	it	's	quite	romantic	,	but	it	's	about	if	one	person	teaches	three	people	how	to	cook	something	,	and	they	teach	three	of	their	mates	,	that	only	has	to	repeat	itself	25	times	,	and	that	's	the	whole	population	of	america	.
romantic	,	yes	,	but	most	importantly	,	it	's	about	trying	to	get	people	to	realize	that	every	one	of	your	individual	efforts	makes	a	difference	.
we	've	got	to	put	back	what	's	been	lost	.
huntington	kitchen	.	huntington	,	where	i	made	this	program	,	you	know	,	we	've	got	this	prime	-	time	program	that	hopefully	will	inspire	people	to	really	get	on	this	change	.
i	truly	believe	that	change	will	happen	.
huntington	's	kitchen	.	i	work	with	a	community	.
i	worked	in	the	schools	.	i	found	local	sustainable	funding	to	get	every	single	school	in	the	area	,	from	the	junk	,	onto	the	fresh	food	:
six	-	and	-	a	-	half	grand	per	school	.
that	's	all	it	takes	,	six	-	and	-	a	-	half	grand	per	school	.
the	kitchen	is	25	grand	a	month	.	okay	?
this	can	do	5,000	people	a	year	,	which	is	10	percent	of	their	population	,
and	it	's	people	on	people	.
you	know	,	it	's	local	cooks	teaching	local	people	.
it	's	free	cooking	lessons	,	guys	,	free	cooking	lessons	in	the	main	street	.
this	is	real	,	tangible	change	,	real	,	tangible	change	.
around	america	,	if	we	just	look	back	now	,	there	is	plenty	of	wonderful	things	going	on	.
there	is	plenty	of	beautiful	things	going	on	.	there	are	angels	around	america	doing	great	things	in	schools	--	farm	-	to	-	school	set	-	ups	,	garden	set	-	ups	,	education	--
there	are	amazing	people	doing	this	already	.
the	problem	is	they	all	want	to	roll	out	what	they	're	doing	to	the	next	school	,	and	the	next	,
but	there	's	no	cash	.
we	need	to	recognize	the	experts	and	the	angels	quickly	,	identify	them	,	and	allow	them	to	easily	find	the	resource	to	keep	rolling	out	what	they	're	already	doing	,	and	doing	well	.
businesses	of	america	need	to	support	mrs.	obama	to	do	the	things	that	she	wants	to	do	.
and	look	,	i	know	it	's	weird	having	an	english	person	standing	here	before	you	talking	about	all	this	.
all	i	can	say	is	:	i	care	.	i	'm	a	father	,
and	i	love	this	country	,
and	i	believe	truly	,	actually	,	that	if	change	can	be	made	in	this	country	,	beautiful	things	will	happen	around	the	world	.	if	america	does	it	,	i	believe	other	people	will	follow	.
it	's	incredibly	important	.
when	i	was	in	huntington	,	trying	to	get	a	few	things	to	work	when	they	were	n't	,	i	thought	``	if	i	had	a	magic	wand	,	what	would	i	do	?	``	and	i	thought	,	``	you	know	what	?
i	'd	just	love	to	be	put	in	front	of	some	of	the	most	amazing	movers	and	shakers	in	america	.	``
and	a	month	later	,	ted	phoned	me	up	and	gave	me	this	award	.
i	'm	here	.
so	,	my	wish	.
dyslexic	,	so	i	'm	a	bit	slow	.
my	wish	is	for	you	to	help	a	strong	,	sustainable	movement	to	educate	every	child	about	food	,	to	inspire	families	to	cook	again	,	and	to	empower	people	everywhere	to	fight	obesity	.
thank	you	.
