i	'm	here	because	i	have	a	very	important	message	:
i	think	we	have	found
the	most	important	factor	for	success	.
and	it	was	found	close	to	here	,	stanford	.
psychology	professor	took	kids	that	were	four	years	old
and	put	them	in	a	room	all	by	themselves	.
and	he	would	tell	the	child	,	a	four	-	year	-	old	kid	,
``	johnny	,	i	am	going	to	leave	you	here	with	a	marshmallow
for	15	minutes	.
if	,	after	i	come	back	,	this	marshmallow	is	here	,	you	will	get	another	one	.	so	you	will	have	two	.	``	to	tell	a	four	-	year	-	old	kid	to	wait	15	minutes	for	something	that	they	like	,	is	equivalent	to	telling	us	,	``	we	'll	bring	you	coffee	in	two	hours	.	``	exact	equivalent	.
so	what	happened	when	the	professor	left	the	room	?
as	soon	as	the	door	closed	...
two	out	of	three	ate	the	marshmallow	.
five	seconds	,	10	seconds	,	40	seconds	,	50	seconds	,	two	minutes	,	four	minutes	,	eight	minutes	.
some	lasted	14	-	and	-	a	-	half	minutes	.
could	n't	do	it	.	could	not	wait	.
what	's	interesting	is	that	one	out	of	three	would	look	at	the	marshmallow	and	go	like	this	...
would	look	at	it	.
put	it	back	.
they	would	walk	around	.	they	would	play	with	their	skirts	and	pants	.
that	child	already	,	at	four	,	understood	the	most	important	principle	for	success	,
which	is	the	ability	to	delay	gratification	.
self	-	discipline	:	the	most	important	factor	for	success	.
15	years	later	,	14	or	15	years	later	,
follow	-	up	study	.
what	did	they	find	?
they	went	to	look	for	these	kids	who	were	now	18	and	19	.
and	they	found	that	100	percent	of	the	children	that	had	not	eaten	the	marshmallow	were	successful	.
they	had	good	grades	.	they	were	doing	wonderful	.
they	were	happy	.	they	had	their	plans	.
they	had	good	relationships	with	the	teachers	,	students	.
they	were	doing	fine	.
a	great	percentage	of	the	kids	that	ate	the	marshmallow	,	they	were	in	trouble	.
they	did	not	make	it	to	university	.
they	had	bad	grades	.	some	of	them	dropped	out	.
a	few	were	still	there	with	bad	grades	.
a	few	had	good	grades	.
i	had	a	question	in	my	mind	:	would	hispanic	kids
react	the	same	way	as	the	american	kids	?
so	i	went	to	colombia	.	and	i	reproduced	the	experiment	.
and	it	was	very	funny	.	i	used	four	,	five	and	six	years	old	kids	.
and	let	me	show	you	what	happened	.
so	what	happened	in	colombia	?
hispanic	kids	,	two	out	of	three	ate	the	marshmallow	;
one	out	of	three	did	not	.
this	little	girl	was	interesting	;
she	ate	the	inside	of	the	marshmallow	.
in	other	words	,	she	wanted	us	to	think	that	she	had	not	eaten	it	,	so	she	would	get	two	.
but	she	ate	it	.
so	we	know	she	'll	be	successful	.	but	we	have	to	watch	her	.
she	should	not	go	into	banking	,	for	example	,
or	work	at	a	cash	register	.
but	she	will	be	successful	.
and	this	applies	for	everything	.	even	in	sales	.
the	sales	person	that	--
the	customer	says	,	``	i	want	that	.	``	and	the	person	says	,	``	okay	,	here	you	are	.	``
that	person	ate	the	marshmallow	.
if	the	sales	person	says	,	``	wait	a	second	.	let	me	ask	you	a	few	questions	to	see	if	this	is	a	good	choice	.	``	then	you	sell	a	lot	more	.
so	this	has	applications	in	all	walks	of	life	.
i	end	with	--	the	koreans	did	this	.	you	know	what	?	this	is	so	good	that	we	want	a	marshmallow	book	for	children	.
we	did	one	for	children	.	and	now	it	is	all	over	korea	.
they	are	teaching	these	kids	exactly	this	principle	.
and	we	need	to	learn	that	principle	here	in	the	states	,
because	we	have	a	big	debt	.
we	are	eating	more	marshmallows	than	we	are	producing	.
thank	you	so	much	.
