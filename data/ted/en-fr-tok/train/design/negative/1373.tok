i	'm	going	to	speak	about	a	tiny	,	little	idea	.
and	this	is	about	shifting	baseline	.
and	because	the	idea	can	be	explained	in	one	minute	,	i	will	tell	you	three	stories	before	to	fill	in	the	time	.
and	the	first	story	is	about	charles	darwin	,	one	of	my	heroes	.
and	he	was	here	,	as	you	well	know	,	in	'35	.
and	you	'd	think	he	was	chasing	finches	,	but	he	was	n't	.
he	was	actually	collecting	fish	.
and	he	described	one	of	them	as	very	``	common	.	``
this	was	the	_UNK_	grouper	.	a	big	fishery	was	run	on	it	until	the	'80s	.
now	the	fish	is	on	the	iucn	red	list	.
now	this	story	,	we	have	heard	it	lots	of	times	on	galapagos	and	other	places	,	so	there	is	nothing	particular	about	it	.
but	the	point	is	,	we	still	come	to	galapagos	.
we	still	think	it	is	pristine	.
the	brochures	still	say	it	is	untouched	.
so	what	happens	here	?
the	second	story	,	also	to	illustrate	another	concept	,	is	called	shifting	waistline	.
because	i	was	there	in	'71	,	studying	a	lagoon	in	west	africa	.
i	was	there	because	i	grew	up	in	europe	and	i	wanted	later	to	work	in	africa	.
and	i	thought	i	could	blend	in	.
and	i	got	a	big	sunburn	,	and	i	was	convinced	that	i	was	really	not	from	there	.
this	was	my	first	sunburn	.
and	the	lagoon	was	surrounded	by	palm	trees	,	as	you	can	see	,	and	a	few	mangrove	.
and	it	had	tilapia	about	20	centimeters	,	a	species	of	tilapia	called	_UNK_	tilapia	.
and	the	fisheries	for	this	tilapia	sustained	lots	of	fish	and	they	had	a	good	time	and	they	earned	more	than	average	in	ghana	.
when	i	went	there	27	years	later	,	the	fish	had	shrunk	to	half	of	their	size	.
they	were	maturing	at	five	centimeters	.
they	had	been	pushed	genetically	.
there	were	still	fishes	.
they	were	still	kind	of	happy	.
and	the	fish	also	were	happy	to	be	there	.
so	nothing	has	changed	,	but	everything	has	changed	.
my	third	little	story	is	that	i	was	an	_UNK_	in	the	introduction	of	trawling	in	southeast	asia	.	in	the	'70s	--	well	,	beginning	in	the	'60s	--	europe	did	lots	of	development	projects	.
fish	development	meant	imposing	on	countries	that	had	already	100,000	fishers	to	impose	on	them	industrial	fishing	.
and	this	boat	,	quite	ugly	,	is	called	the	_UNK_	4	.
and	i	went	sailing	on	it	,	and	we	did	surveys	throughout	the	southern	south	china	sea	and	especially	the	java	sea	.
and	what	we	caught	,	we	did	n't	have	words	for	it	.
what	we	caught	,	i	know	now	,	is	the	bottom	of	the	sea	.
and	90	percent	of	our	catch	were	sponges	,	other	animals	that	are	fixed	on	the	bottom	.
and	actually	most	of	the	fish	,	they	are	a	little	spot	on	the	debris	,	the	piles	of	debris	,	were	coral	reef	fish	.
essentially	the	bottom	of	the	sea	came	onto	the	deck	and	then	was	thrown	down	.
and	these	pictures	are	extraordinary	because	this	transition	is	very	rapid	.
within	a	year	,	you	do	a	survey	and	then	commercial	fishing	begins	.
the	bottom	is	transformed	from	,	in	this	case	,	a	hard	bottom	or	soft	coral	into	a	muddy	mess	.
this	is	a	dead	turtle	.
they	were	not	eaten	,	they	were	thrown	away	because	they	were	dead	.
and	one	time	we	caught	a	live	one	.
it	was	not	drowned	yet	.
and	then	they	wanted	to	kill	it	because	it	was	good	to	eat	.
this	mountain	of	debris	is	actually	collected	by	fishers	every	time	they	go	into	an	area	that	's	never	been	fished	.
but	it	's	not	documented	.
we	transform	the	world	,	but	we	do	n't	remember	it	.
we	adjust	our	baseline	to	the	new	level	,	and	we	do	n't	recall	what	was	there	.
if	you	generalize	this	,	something	like	this	happens	.
you	have	on	the	y	axis	some	good	thing	:	biodiversity	,	numbers	of	orca	,	the	_UNK_	of	your	country	,	the	water	supply	.
and	over	time	it	changes	--
it	changes	because	people	do	things	,	or	naturally	.
every	generation	will	use	the	images	that	they	got	at	the	beginning	of	their	conscious	lives	as	a	standard	and	will	extrapolate	forward	.
and	the	difference	then	,	they	perceive	as	a	loss	.
but	they	do	n't	perceive	what	happened	before	as	a	loss	.
you	can	have	a	succession	of	changes	.
at	the	end	you	want	to	sustain	miserable	leftovers	.
and	that	,	to	a	large	extent	,	is	what	we	want	to	do	now	.
we	want	to	sustain	things	that	are	gone	or	things	that	are	not	the	way	they	were	.
now	one	should	think	this	problem	affected	people	certainly	when	in	predatory	societies	,	they	killed	animals	and	they	did	n't	know	they	had	done	so	after	a	few	generations	.
because	,	obviously	,	an	animal	that	is	very	abundant	,	before	it	gets	extinct	,	it	becomes	rare	.
so	you	do	n't	lose	abundant	animals	.
you	always	lose	rare	animals	.
and	therefore	they	're	not	perceived	as	a	big	loss	.
over	time	,	we	concentrate	on	large	animals	,	and	in	a	sea	that	means	the	big	fish	.
they	become	rarer	because	we	fish	them	.
over	time	we	have	a	few	fish	left	and	we	think	this	is	the	baseline	.
and	the	question	is	,	why	do	people	accept	this	?
well	because	they	do	n't	know	that	it	was	different	.
and	in	fact	,	lots	of	people	,	scientists	,	will	contest	that	it	was	really	different	.
and	they	will	contest	this	because	the	evidence	presented	in	an	earlier	mode	is	not	in	the	way	they	would	like	the	evidence	presented	.
for	example	,	the	anecdote	that	some	present	,	as	captain	so	-	and	-	so	observed	lots	of	fish	in	this	area	can	not	be	used	or	is	usually	not	utilized	by	fishery	scientists	,	because	it	's	not	``	scientific	.	``
so	you	have	a	situation	where	people	do	n't	know	the	past	,	even	though	we	live	in	literate	societies	,	because	they	do	n't	trust	the	sources	of	the	past	.
and	hence	,	the	enormous	role	that	a	marine	protected	area	can	play	.
because	with	marine	protected	areas	,	we	actually	recreate	the	past	.
we	recreate	the	past	that	people	can	not	conceive	because	the	baseline	has	shifted	and	is	extremely	low	.
that	is	for	people	who	can	see	a	marine	protected	area	and	who	can	benefit	from	the	insight	that	it	provides	,	which	enables	them	to	reset	their	baseline	.
how	about	the	people	who	ca	n't	do	that	because	they	have	no	access	--	the	people	in	the	midwest	for	example	?
there	i	think	that	the	arts	and	film	can	perhaps	fill	the	gap	,	and	simulation	.
this	is	a	simulation	of	chesapeake	bay	.
there	were	gray	whales	in	chesapeake	bay	a	long	time	ago	--	500	years	ago	.
and	you	will	have	noticed	that	the	hues	and	tones	are	like	``	avatar	.	``
and	if	you	think	about	``	avatar	,	``	if	you	think	of	why	people	were	so	touched	by	it	--	never	mind	the	_UNK_	story	--	why	so	touched	by	the	imagery	?
because	it	evokes	something	that	in	a	sense	has	been	lost	.
and	so	my	recommendation	,	it	's	the	only	one	i	will	provide	,	is	for	cameron	to	do	``	avatar	ii	``	underwater	.
thank	you	very	much	.
