this	is	very	strange	for	me	,	because	i	'm	not	used	to	doing	this	:
i	usually	stand	on	the	other	side	of	the	light	,	and	now	i	'm	feeling	the	pressure	i	put	other	people	into	.	and	it	's	hard	...
the	previous	speaker	has	,	i	think	,	really	painted	a	very	good	background	as	to	the	impulse	behind	my	work	and	what	drives	me	,	and	my	sense	of	loss	,	and	trying	to	find	the	answer	to	the	big	questions	.
but	this	,	for	me	,	i	mean	,	coming	here	to	do	this	,	feels	like	--	there	's	this	sculptor	that	i	like	very	much	,	giacometti	,	who	after	many	years	of	living	in	france	--	and	learning	,	you	know	,	studying	and	working	--	he	returned	home	and	he	was	asked	,	what	did	you	produce	?
what	have	you	done	with	so	many	years	of	being	away	?
and	he	sort	of	,	he	showed	a	handful	of	figurines	.
and	obviously	they	were	,	``	is	this	what	you	spent	years	doing	?
and	we	expected	huge	masterpieces	!	``
but	what	struck	me	is	the	understanding	that	in	those	little	pieces	was	the	culmination	of	a	man	's	life	,	search	,	thought	,	everything	--
just	in	a	reduced	,	small	version	.
in	a	way	,	i	feel	like	that	.
i	feel	like	i	'm	coming	home	to	talk	about	what	i	've	been	away	doing	for	20	years	.
and	i	will	start	with	a	brief	taster	of	what	i	've	been	about	:
a	handful	of	films	--	nothing	much	,	two	feature	films	and	a	handful	of	short	films	.
so	,	we	'll	go	with	the	first	piece	.
court	:	sleep	.	court	:	where	?	woman	:	nigeria	.	court	:	never	.	could	n't	afford	it	.	boy	:	what	do	you	do	all	day	?
marcus	:	read	.
boy	:	do	n't	you	get	bored	?
and	how	come	you	ai	n't	got	a	job	anyway	?
marcus	:	i	am	retired	.
boy	:	so	?
marcus	:	so	i	've	done	my	bit	for	queen	and	country	,	now	i	work	for	myself	.
boy	:	no	,	now	you	sit	around	like	a	bum	all	day	.
marcus	:	because	i	do	what	i	like	?
boy	:	look	man	,	reading	do	n't	feed	no	one	.
and	it	particularly	do	n't	feed	your	spliff	habit	.
marcus	:	it	feeds	my	mind	and	my	soul	.
boy	:	arguing	with	you	is	a	waste	of	time	,	marcus	.
marcus	:	you	're	a	rapper	,	am	i	right	?
boy	:	yeah	.
marcus	:	a	modern	day	poet	.
boy	:	yeah	,	you	could	say	that	.
marcus	:	so	what	do	you	talk	about	?
boy	:	what	's	that	supposed	to	mean	?
marcus	:	simple	.	what	do	you	rap	about	?
boy	:	reality	,	man	.
marcus	:	whose	reality	?
boy	:	my	fuckin	'	reality	.
marcus	:	tell	me	about	your	reality	.
boy	:	racism	,	oppression	,	people	like	me	not	getting	a	break	in	life	.
marcus	:	so	what	solutions	do	you	offer	?	i	mean	,	the	job	of	a	poet	is	not	just	--
boy	:	man	,	fight	the	power	!	simple	:	blow	the	motherfuckers	out	of	the	sky	.
marcus	:	with	an	ak	-	47	?
boy	:	man	,	if	i	had	one	,	too	fuckin	'	right	.
marcus	:	and	how	many	soldiers	have	you	recruited	to	fight	this	war	with	you	?
boy	:	oh	,	marcus	,	you	know	what	i	mean	.
marcus	:	when	a	man	resorts	to	profanities	,	it	's	a	sure	sign	of	his	inability	to	express	himself	.
boy	:	see	man	,	you	're	just	taking	the	piss	out	of	me	now	.
marcus	:	the	panthers	.
boy	:	panthers	?
ass	kickin	'	guys	who	were	fed	up	with	all	that	white	supremacist	,	powers	-	that	-	be	bullshit	,	and	just	went	in	there	and	kicked	everybody	's	arse	.
fuckin	'	wicked	,	man	.	i	saw	the	movie	.	bad	!	what	?
épuise	,	right	?	woman	1	:	yes	.	let	's	go	.	w	1	:	they	suck	.	dream	about	bullshit	.	newton	aduaka	:	thank	you	.	the	first	clip	,	really	,	is	totally	trying	to	capture	what	cinema	is	for	me	,	and	where	i	'm	coming	from	in	terms	of	cinema	.
the	first	piece	was	,	really	,	there	's	a	young	woman	talking	about	nigeria	,	that	she	has	a	feeling	she	'll	be	happy	there	.
these	are	the	sentiments	of	someone	that	's	been	away	from	home	.	and	that	was	something	that	i	went	through	,	you	know	,	and	i	'm	still	going	through	.
i	've	not	been	home	for	quite	a	while	,	for	about	five	years	now	.
i	've	been	away	20	years	in	total	.
and	so	it	's	really	--	it	's	really	how	suddenly	,	you	know	,	this	was	made	in	1997	,	which	is	the	time	of	abacha	--	the	military	dictatorship	,	the	worst	part	of	nigerian	history	,	this	post	-	colonial	history	.
so	,	for	this	girl	to	have	these	dreams	is	simply	how	we	preserve	a	sense	of	what	home	is	.
how	--	and	it	's	sort	of	,	perhaps	romantic	,	but	i	think	beautiful	,	because	you	just	need	something	to	hold	on	to	,	especially	in	a	society	where	you	feel	alienated	.
which	takes	us	to	the	next	piece	,	where	the	young	man	talks	about	lack	of	opportunity	:	living	as	a	black	person	in	europe	,
the	glass	ceiling	that	we	all	know	about	,	that	we	all	talk	about	,
and	his	reality	.
again	,	this	was	my	--	this	was	me	talking	about	--	this	was	,	again	,	the	time	of	multiculturalism	in	the	united	kingdom	,	and	there	was	this	buzzword	--	and	it	was	trying	to	say	,	what	exactly	does	this	multiculturalism	mean	in	the	real	lives	of	people	?
and	what	would	a	child	--	what	does	a	child	like	jamie	--	the	young	boy	--	think	,	i	mean	,	with	all	this	anger	that	's	built	up	inside	of	him	?	what	happens	with	that	?
what	,	of	course	,	happens	with	that	is	violence	,	which	we	see	when	we	talk	about	the	ghettos	and	we	talk	about	,	you	know	,	south	central	l.a.	and	this	kind	of	stuff	,
and	which	eventually	,	when	channeled	,	becomes	,	you	know	,	evolves	and	manifests	itself	as	riots	--	like	the	one	in	france	two	years	ago	,	where	i	live	,	which	shocked	everybody	,	because	everyone	thought	,	``	oh	well	,	france	is	a	liberal	society	.	``
but	i	lived	in	england	for	18	years	.	i	've	lived	in	france	for	about	four	,	and	i	feel	actually	thrown	back	20	years	,	living	in	france	.
and	then	,	the	third	piece	.	the	third	piece	for	me	is	the	question	:	what	is	cinema	to	you	?	what	do	you	do	with	cinema	?
there	's	a	young	director	,	hollywood	director	,	with	his	friends	--	fellow	filmmakers	--	talking	about	what	cinema	means	.
i	suppose	that	will	take	me	to	my	last	piece	--	what	cinema	means	for	me	.
my	life	started	as	a	--	i	started	life	in	1966	,	a	few	months	before	the	biafran	,	which	lasted	for	three	years	and	it	was	three	years	of	war	.
so	that	whole	thing	,	that	whole	childhood	echoes	and	takes	me	into	the	next	piece	.
voice	:	onicha	,	off	to	school	with	your	brother	.
onicha	:	yes	,	mama	.
commander	:	soldiers	,	you	are	going	to	fight	a	battle	,	so	you	must	get	ready	and	willing	to	die	.
you	must	get	--	?
child	soldiers	:	ready	and	willing	to	die	.
c	:	success	,	the	change	is	only	coming	through	the	barrel	of	the	gun	.
cs	:	the	barrel	of	the	gun	!
c	:	this	is	the	gun	.
cs	:	this	is	the	gun	.
c	:	this	is	an	ak	-	47	rifle	.	this	is	your	life	.
this	is	your	life	.	this	is	...	this	is	...	this	is	your	life	.
ezra	:	they	give	us	the	special	drugs	.	we	call	it	bubbles	.
amphetamines	.
soldiers	:	rain	come	,	sun	come	,	soldier	man	dey	go	.
i	say	rain	come	,	sun	come	,	soldier	man	dey	go	.
we	went	from	one	village	to	another	--	three	villages	.
i	do	n't	remember	how	we	got	there	.
witness	:	we	walked	and	walked	for	two	days	.
we	did	n't	eat	.
there	was	no	food	,	just	little	rice	.
without	food	--	i	was	sick	.
the	injection	made	us	not	to	have	mind	.
god	will	forgive	us	.
he	knows	we	did	not	know	.	we	did	not	know	!
committee	chairman	:	do	you	remember	january	6th	,	1999	?
ezra	:	i	do	n't	remember	.
various	voices	:	you	will	die	!	you	will	die	!
onicha	:	ezra	!
various	voices	:	♫	we	do	n't	need	no	more	trouble	♫	♫	no	more	trouble	♫	they	killed	my	mother	.
the	mende	sons	of	bastards	.
who	is	she	?
me	.
why	you	giving	these	to	me	?
so	you	can	stop	staring	at	me	.
my	story	is	a	little	bit	complicated	.
i	'm	interested	.
mariam	is	pregnant	.
you	know	what	you	are	?	a	crocodile	.
big	mouth	.	short	legs	.
in	front	of	rufus	you	are	ezra	the	coward	.
he	's	not	taking	care	of	his	troops	.
troop	,	pay	your	last	honor	.	salute	.
open	your	eyes	,	ezra	.
a	blind	man	can	see	that	the	diamonds	end	up	in	his	pocket	.
♫	we	do	n't	need	no	more	trouble	♫	get	that	idiot	out	!
i	take	you	are	preparing	a	major	attack	?
this	must	be	the	mine	.
your	girl	is	here	.
well	done	,	well	done	.
that	is	what	you	are	here	for	,	no	?
you	are	planning	to	go	back	to	fight	are	you	?
♫	we	do	n't	need	no	more	trouble	♫	♫	no	more	trouble	♫	♫	we	do	n't	need	no	more	trouble	♫	♫	no	more	trouble	.	♫	wake	up	!	everybody	wake	up	.	road	block	!
♫	we	do	n't	need	no	more	...	♫	committee	chairman	:	we	hope	that	,	with	your	help	and	the	help	of	others	,	that	this	commission	will	go	a	long	way	towards	understanding	the	causes	of	the	rebel	war	.
more	than	that	,	begin	a	healing	process	and	finally	to	--	as	an	act	of	closure	to	a	terrible	period	in	this	country	's	history	.
the	beginning	of	hope	.
mr.	ezra	gelehun	,	please	stand	.
state	your	name	and	age	for	the	commission	.
ezra	:	my	name	is	ezra	gelehun	.
i	am	15	or	16.	i	do	n't	remember	.
ask	my	sister	,	she	is	the	witch	,	she	knows	everything	.
cc	:	mr.	gelehun	,	i	'd	like	to	remind	you	you	're	not	on	trial	here	for	any	crimes	you	committed	.
e	:	we	were	fighting	for	our	freedom	.
if	killing	in	a	war	is	a	crime	,	then	you	have	to	charge	every	soldier	in	the	world	.
war	is	a	crime	,	yes	,	but	i	did	not	start	it	.
you	too	are	a	retired	general	,	not	so	?
cc	:	yes	,	correct	.
e	:	so	you	too	must	stand	trial	then	.
our	government	was	corrupt	.
lack	of	education	was	their	way	to	control	power	.
if	i	may	ask	,	do	you	pay	for	school	in	your	country	?
e	:	you	are	richer	than	us	.
but	we	pay	for	school	.
your	country	talks	about	democracy	,
but	you	support	corrupt	governments	like	my	own	.
why	?	because	you	want	our	diamond	.
ask	if	anyone	in	this	room	have	ever	seen	real	diamond	before	?
no	.
cc	:	mr.	gelehun	,	i	'd	like	to	remind	you	,	you	're	not	on	trial	here	today	.
you	are	not	on	trial	.
e	:	then	let	me	go	.
cc	:	i	ca	n't	do	that	,	son	.
e	:	so	you	are	a	liar	.
na	:	thank	you	.	just	very	quickly	to	say	that	my	point	really	here	,	is	that	while	we	're	making	all	these	huge	advancements	,	what	we	're	doing	,	which	for	me	,	you	know	,	i	think	we	should	--	africa	should	move	forward	,	but	we	should	remember	,	so	we	do	not	go	back	here	again	.
thank	you	.
emeka	okafor	:	thank	you	,	newton	.
one	of	the	themes	that	comes	through	very	strongly	in	the	piece	we	just	watched	is	this	sense	of	the	psychological	trauma	of	the	young	that	have	to	play	this	role	of	being	child	soldiers	.
and	considering	where	you	are	coming	from	,	and	when	we	consider	the	extent	to	which	it	's	not	taken	as	seriously	as	it	should	be	,	what	would	you	have	to	say	about	that	?
na	:	in	the	process	of	my	research	,	i	actually	spent	a	bit	of	time	in	sierra	leone	researching	this	.
and	i	remember	i	met	a	lot	of	child	soldiers	--	ex	-	combatants	,	as	they	like	to	be	called	.
i	met	psychosocial	workers	who	worked	with	them	.	i	met	psychiatrists	who	spent	time	with	them	,	aid	workers	,	ngos	,	the	whole	lot	.
but	i	remember	on	the	flight	back	on	my	last	trip	,	i	remember	breaking	down	in	tears	and	thinking	to	myself	,	if	any	kid	in	the	west	,	in	the	western	world	,	went	through	a	day	of	what	any	of	those	kids	have	gone	through	,	they	will	be	in	therapy	for	the	rest	of	their	natural	lives	.
so	for	me	,	the	thought	that	we	have	all	these	children	--	it	's	a	generation	,	we	have	a	whole	generation	of	children	--	who	have	been	put	through	so	much	psychological	trauma	or	damage	,
and	africa	has	to	live	with	that	.
but	i	'm	just	saying	to	factor	that	in	,	factor	that	in	with	all	this	great	advancement	,	all	this	pronouncement	of	great	achievement	.
that	's	really	my	thinking	.
eo	:	well	,	we	thank	you	again	for	coming	to	the	ted	stage	.
that	was	a	very	moving	piece	.
na	:	thank	you	.
eo	:	thank	you	.
