i	get	asked	a	lot	what	the	difference	between	my	work	is	and	typical	pentagon	long	-	range	strategic	planners	.
and	the	answer	i	like	to	offer	is	what	they	typically	do	is	they	think	about	the	future	of	wars	in	the	context	of	war	.
and	what	i	've	spent	15	years	doing	in	this	business	--	and	it	's	taken	me	almost	14	to	figure	it	out	--	is	i	think	about	the	future	of	wars	in	the	context	of	everything	else	.
so	i	tend	to	specialize	on	the	scene	between	war	and	peace	.
the	material	i	'm	going	to	show	you	is	one	idea	from	a	book
with	a	lot	of	ideas	.
it	's	the	one	that	takes	me	around	the	world	right	now	interacting	with	foreign	militaries	quite	a	bit	.
the	material	was	generated	in	two	years	of	work	i	did	for	the	secretary	of	defense	,	thinking	about	a	new	national	grand	strategy	for	the	united	states	.
i	'm	going	to	present	a	problem	and	try	to	give	you	an	answer	.
here	's	my	favorite	bonehead	concept	from	the	1990s	in	the	pentagon	:	the	theory	of	anti	-	access	,	area	-	denial	asymmetrical	strategies	.
why	do	we	call	it	that	?
because	it	's	got	all	those	a	's	lined	up	i	guess	.
this	is	gobbledygook	for	if	the	united	states	fights	somebody	we	're	going	to	be	huge	.	they	're	going	to	be	small	.
and	if	they	try	to	fight	us	in	the	traditional	,	straight	-	up	manner	we	're	going	to	kick	their	ass	,	which	is	why	people	do	n't	try	to	do	that	any	more	.
i	met	the	last	air	force	general	who	had	actually	shot	down	an	enemy	plane	in	combat	.
he	's	now	a	one	star	general	.
that	's	how	distant	we	are	from	even	meeting	an	air	force	willing	to	fly	against	ours	.
so	that	overmatched	capability	creates	problems	--	catastrophic	successes	the	white	house	calls	them	.
and	we	're	trying	to	figure	that	out	,	because	it	is	an	amazing	capability	.
the	question	is	,	what	's	the	good	you	can	do	with	it	?
ok	?
the	theory	of	anti	-	access	,	area	-	denial	asymmetrical	strategies	--	gobbledygook	that	we	sell	to	congress	,	because	if	we	just	told	them	we	can	kick	anybody	's	asses	they	would	n't	buy	us	all	the	stuff	we	want	.
so	we	say	,	area	-	denial	,	anti	-	access	asymmetrical	strategies	and	their	eyes	glaze	over	.
and	they	say	,	``	will	you	build	it	in	my	district	?	``
here	's	my	parody	and	it	ai	n't	much	of	one	.
let	's	talk	about	a	battle	space	.	i	do	n't	know	,	taiwan	straits	2025	.
let	's	talk	about	an	enemy	embedded	within	that	battle	space	.
i	do	n't	know	,	the	million	man	swim	.
the	united	states	has	to	access	that	battle	space	instantaneously	.
they	throw	up	anti	-	access	,	area	-	denial	asymmetrical	strategies	.
a	banana	peel	on	the	tarmac	.
trojan	horses	on	our	computer	networks	reveal	all	our	achilles	'	heels	instantly	.
we	say	,	``	china	,	it	's	yours	.	``
prometheus	approach	,	largely	a	geographic	definition	,	focuses	almost	exclusively	on	the	start	of	conflict	.
we	field	the	first	-	half	team	in	a	league	that	insists	on	keeping	score	until	the	end	of	the	game	.
that	's	the	problem	.
we	can	run	the	score	up	against	anybody	,	and	then	get	our	asses	kicked	in	the	second	half	--	what	they	call	fourth	generation	warfare	.
here	's	the	way	i	like	to	describe	it	instead	.
there	is	no	battle	space	the	u.s.	military	can	not	access	.
they	said	we	could	n't	do	afghanistan	.	we	did	it	with	ease	.
they	said	we	could	n't	do	iraq	.
we	did	it	with	150	combat	casualties	in	six	weeks	.
we	did	it	so	fast	we	were	n't	prepared	for	their	collapse	.
there	is	nobody	we	ca	n't	take	down	.
the	question	is	,	what	do	you	do	with	the	power	?
so	there	's	no	trouble	accessing	battle	spaces	.
what	we	have	trouble	accessing	is	the	transition	space	that	must	naturally	follow	,	and	creating	the	peace	space	that	allows	us	to	move	on	.
problem	is	,	the	defense	department	over	here	beats	the	hell	out	of	you	.
the	state	department	over	here	says	,	``	come	on	boy	,	i	know	you	can	make	it	.	``	and	that	poor	country	runs	off	that	ledge	,	does	that	cartoon	thing	and	then	drops	.
this	is	not	about	overwhelming	force	,	but	proportional	force	.
it	's	about	non	-	lethal	technologies	,	because	if	you	fire	real	ammo	into	a	crowd	of	women	and	children	rioting	you	're	going	to	lose	friends	very	quickly	.
this	is	not	about	projecting	power	,	but	about	staying	power	,	which	is	about	legitimacy	with	the	locals	.
who	do	you	access	in	this	transition	space	?
you	have	to	create	internal	partners	.	you	have	to	access	coalition	partners	.
we	asked	the	indians	for	17,000	peace	keepers	.
i	know	their	senior	leadership	,	they	wanted	to	give	it	to	us	.
but	they	said	to	us	,	``	you	know	what	?
in	that	transition	space	you	're	mostly	hat	not	enough	cattle	.
we	do	n't	think	you	can	pull	it	off	,	we	're	not	going	to	give	you	our	17,000	peace	keepers	for	fodder	.	``
we	asked	the	russians	for	40,000	.
they	said	no	.
i	was	in	china	in	august	,	i	said	,	``	you	should	have	50,000	peace	keepers	in	iraq	.	it	's	your	oil	,	not	ours	.	``	which	is	the	truth	.	it	's	their	oil	.
and	the	chinese	said	to	me	,	``	dr.	barnett	,	you	're	absolutely	right	.
in	a	perfect	world	we	'd	have	50,000	there	.
but	it	's	not	a	perfect	world	,	and	your	administration	is	n't	getting	us	any	closer	.	``	but	we	have	trouble	accessing	our	outcomes	.
we	lucked	out	,	frankly	,	on	the	selection	.
we	face	different	opponents	across	these	three	.
and	it	's	time	to	start	admitting	you	ca	n't	ask	the	same	19	-	year	-	old	to	do	it	all	,	day	in	and	day	out	.
it	's	just	too	damn	hard	.
we	have	an	unparalleled	capacity	to	wage	war	.
we	do	n't	do	the	everything	else	so	well	.
frankly	,	we	do	it	better	than	anybody	and	we	still	suck	at	it	.
we	have	a	brilliant	secretary	of	war	.
we	do	n't	have	a	secretary	of	everything	else	.
because	if	we	did	,	that	guy	would	be	in	front	of	the	senate	,	still	testifying	over	abu	ghraib	.
the	problem	is	he	does	n't	exist	.
there	is	no	secretary	of	everything	else	.
i	think	we	have	an	unparalleled	capacity	to	wage	war	.
i	call	that	the	leviathan	force	.
what	we	need	to	build	is	a	force	for	the	everything	else	.	i	call	them	the	system	administrators	.
what	i	think	this	really	represents	is	lack	of	an	a	to	z	rule	set	for	the	world	as	a	whole	for	processing	politically	bankrupt	states	.
we	have	one	for	processing	economically	bankrupt	states	.
it	's	the	imf	sovereign	bankruptcy	plan	,	ok	?
we	argue	about	it	every	time	we	use	it	.
argentina	just	went	through	it	,	broke	a	lot	of	rules	.
they	got	out	on	the	far	end	,	we	said	,	``	fine	,	do	n't	worry	about	it	.	``
it	's	transparent	.	a	certain	amount	of	certainty	gives	the	sense	of	a	non	-	zero	outcome	.
we	do	n't	have	one	for	processing	politically	bankrupt	states	that	,	frankly	,	everybody	wants	gone	.
like	saddam	,	like	mugabe	,	like	kim	jong	-	il	--	people	who	kill	in	hundreds	of	thousands	or	millions	.
like	the	250,000	dead	so	far	in	sudan	.
what	would	an	a	to	z	system	look	like	?
i	'm	going	to	distinguish	between	what	i	call	front	half	and	back	half	.
and	let	's	call	this	red	line	,	i	do	n't	know	,	mission	accomplished	.
what	we	have	extant	right	now	,	at	the	beginning	of	this	system	,	is	the	u.n.	security	council	as	a	grand	jury	.
what	can	they	do	?
they	can	indict	your	ass	.
they	can	debate	it	.	they	can	write	it	on	a	piece	of	paper	.	they	can	put	it	in	an	envelope	and	mail	it	to	you	,
and	then	say	in	no	uncertain	terms	,	``	please	cut	that	out	.	``
that	gets	you	about	four	million	dead	in	central	africa	over	the	1990s	.
that	gets	you	250,000	dead	in	the	sudan	in	the	last	15	months	.
everybody	's	got	to	answer	their	grandchildren	some	day	what	you	did	about	the	holocaust	in	africa	,
and	you	better	have	an	answer	.
we	do	n't	have	anything	to	translate	that	will	into	action	.
what	we	do	have	is	the	u.s.	-	enabled	leviathan	force	that	says	,	``	you	want	me	to	take	that	guy	down	?	i	'll	take	that	guy	down	.
i	'll	do	it	on	tuesday	.	it	will	cost	you	20	billion	dollars	.	``	but	here	's	the	deal	.
as	soon	as	i	ca	n't	find	anybody	else	to	air	out	,	i	leave	the	scene	immediately	.
that	's	called	the	powell	doctrine	.
way	downstream	we	have	the	international	criminal	court	.
they	love	to	put	them	on	trial	.	they	've	got	milosevic	right	now	.
what	are	we	missing	?
a	functioning	executive	that	will	translate	will	into	action	,
because	we	do	n't	have	it	.	every	time	we	lead	one	of	these	efforts	we	have	to	whip	ourselves	into	this	imminent	threat	thing	.
we	have	n't	faced	an	imminent	threat	since	the	cuban	missile	crisis	in	1962	.
but	we	use	this	language	from	a	bygone	era	to	scare	ourselves	into	doing	something	because	we	're	a	democracy	and	that	's	what	it	takes	.
and	if	that	does	n't	work	we	scream	,	``	he	's	got	a	gun	!	``	just	as	we	rush	in	.
and	then	we	look	over	the	body	and	we	find	an	old	cigarette	lighter	and	we	say	,	``	jesus	,	it	was	dark	.	``	do	you	want	to	do	it	,	france	?
france	says	,	``	no	,	but	i	do	like	to	criticize	you	after	the	fact	.	``	what	we	need	downstream	is	a	great	power	enabled	--	what	i	call	that	sys	admin	force	.
we	should	have	had	250,000	troops	streaming	into	iraq	on	the	heels	of	that	leviathan	sweeping	towards	baghdad	.
what	do	you	get	then	?
no	looting	,	no	military	disappearing	,	no	arms	disappearing	,	no	ammo	disappearing	,	no	muqtada	al-sadr	--	i	'm	wrecking	his	bones	--	no	insurgency	.
talk	to	anybody	who	was	over	there	in	the	first	six	months	.
we	had	six	months	to	feel	the	lob	,	to	get	the	job	done	,	and	we	dicked	around	for	six	months	.
and	then	they	turned	on	us	.
why	?	because	they	just	got	fed	up	.
they	saw	what	we	did	to	saddam	.
they	said	,	``	you	're	that	powerful	,	you	can	resurrect	this	country	.
you	're	america	.	``	what	we	need	is	an	international	reconstruction	fund	--
sebastian	mallaby	,	washington	post	,	great	idea	.
model	on	the	imf	.
instead	of	passing	the	hat	each	time	,	ok	?
where	are	we	going	to	find	this	guy	?	g	20	,	that	's	easy	.
check	out	their	agenda	since	9/11	.
all	security	dominated	.
they	're	going	to	decide	up	front	how	the	money	gets	spent
just	like	in	the	imf	.
you	vote	according	to	how	much	money	you	put	in	the	kitty	.
here	's	my	challenge	to	the	defense	department	.
you	've	got	to	build	this	force	.	you	've	got	to	seed	this	force	.	you	've	got	to	track	coalition	partners	.	create	a	record	of	success	.
you	will	get	this	model	.
you	tell	me	it	's	too	hard	to	do	.
i	'll	walk	this	dog	right	through	that	six	part	series	on	the	balkans	.
we	did	it	just	like	that	.
i	'm	talking	about	regularizing	it	,	making	it	transparent	.
would	you	like	mugabe	gone	?
would	you	like	kim	jong	-	il	,	who	's	killed	about	two	million	people	,	would	you	like	him	gone	?
would	you	like	a	better	system	?
this	is	why	it	matters	to	the	military	.
they	've	been	experiencing	an	identity	crisis	since	the	end	of	the	cold	war	.
i	'm	not	talking	about	the	difference	between	reality	and	desire	,	which	i	can	do	because	i	'm	not	inside	the	beltway	.
i	'm	talking	about	the	1990s	.
the	berlin	wall	falls	.	we	do	desert	storm	.
the	split	starts	to	emerge	between	those	in	the	military	who	see	a	future	they	can	live	with	,	and	those	who	see	a	future	that	starts	to	scare	them	,
like	the	u.s.	submarine	community	,	which	watches	the	soviet	navy	disappear	overnight	.
ah	!
so	they	start	moving	from	reality	towards	desire	and	they	create	their	own	special	language	to	describe	their	voyage	of	self	-	discovery	and	self	-	actualization	.
the	problem	is	you	need	a	big	,	sexy	opponent	to	fight	against	.
and	if	you	ca	n't	find	one	you	've	got	to	make	one	up	.
china	,	all	grown	up	,	going	to	be	a	looker	!
the	rest	of	the	military	got	dragged	down	into	the	muck	across	the	1990s
and	they	developed	this	very	derisive	term	to	describe	it	:	military	operations	other	than	war	.
i	ask	you	,	who	joins	the	military	to	do	things	other	than	war	?
actually	,	most	of	them	.
jessica	lynch	never	planned	on	shooting	back	.
most	of	them	do	n't	pick	up	a	rifle	.
i	maintain	this	is	code	inside	the	army	for	,	``	we	do	n't	want	to	do	this	.	``
they	spent	the	1990s	working	the	messy	scene	between	globalized	parts	of	the	world
what	i	call	the	core	and	the	gap	.
the	clinton	administration	was	n't	interested	in	running	this	.
for	eight	years	,	after	screwing	up	the	relationship	on	day	one	--	inauguration	day	with	gays	in	the	military	--	which	was	deft	.
so	we	were	home	alone	for	eight	years	.
and	what	did	we	do	home	alone	?
we	bought	one	military	and	we	operated	another	.
it	's	like	the	guy	who	goes	to	the	doctor	and	says	,	``	doctor	,	it	hurts	when	i	do	this	.	``	the	doctor	says	,	``	stop	doing	that	you	idiot	.	``	i	used	to	give	this	brief	inside	the	pentagon	in	the	early	1990s	.
i	'd	say	,	``	you	're	buying	one	military	and	you	're	operating	another	,
and	eventually	it	's	going	to	hurt	.	it	's	wrong	.
bad	pentagon	,	bad	!	``	and	they	'd	say	,	``	dr.	barnett	,	you	are	so	right	.
can	you	come	back	next	year	and	remind	us	again	?	``	some	people	say	9/11	heals	the	rift	--	jerks	the	long	-	term	transformation	gurus	out	of	their	30,000	foot	view	of	history	,	drags	them	down	in	to	the	muck	and	says	,	``	you	want	a	networked	opponent	?
i	've	got	one	,	he	's	everywhere	,	go	find	him	.	``
it	elevates	mootw	--	how	we	pronounce	that	acronym	--	from	crap	to	grand	strategy	,	because	that	's	how	you	're	going	to	shrink	that	gap	.
some	people	put	these	two	things	together	and	they	call	it	empire	,	which	i	think	is	a	boneheaded	concept	.
empire	is	about	the	enforcement	of	not	just	minimal	rule	sets	,	which	you	can	not	do	,	but	maximum	rule	sets	which	you	must	do	.
it	's	not	our	system	of	governance	.
never	how	we	've	sought	to	interact	with	the	outside	world	.
i	prefer	that	phrase	system	administration	.
we	enforce	the	minimal	rule	sets	for	maintaining	connectivity	to	the	global	economy	.
certain	bad	things	you	can	not	do	.
how	this	impacts	the	way	we	think	about	the	future	of	war	.
this	is	a	concept	which	gets	me	vilified	throughout	the	pentagon	.
it	makes	me	very	popular	as	well	.
everybody	's	got	an	opinion	.
going	back	to	the	beginning	of	our	country	--	historically	,	defenses	meant	protection	of	the	homeland	.
security	has	meant	everything	else	.
written	into	our	constitution	,	two	different	forces	,	two	different	functions	.
raise	an	army	when	you	need	it	,	and	maintain	a	navy	for	day	-	to	-	day	connectivity	.
a	department	of	war	,	a	department	of	everything	else	.
a	big	stick	,	a	baton	stick	.
can	of	whup	ass	,	the	networking	force	.
in	1947	we	merged	these	two	things	together	in	the	defense	department	.
our	long	-	term	rationale	becomes	,	we	're	involved	in	a	hair	trigger	stand	off	with	the	soviets	.
to	attack	america	is	to	risk	blowing	up	the	world	.
we	connected	national	security	to	international	security	with	about	a	seven	minute	time	delay	.
that	's	not	our	problem	now	.
they	can	kill	three	million	in	chicago	tomorrow	and	we	do	n't	go	to	the	mattresses	with	nukes	.
that	's	the	scary	part	.
the	question	is	how	do	we	reconnect	american	national	security	with	global	security	to	make	the	world	a	lot	more	comfortable	,	and	to	embed	and	contextualize	our	employment	of	force	around	the	planet	?
what	's	happened	since	is	that	bifurcation	i	described	.
we	talked	about	this	going	all	the	way	back	to	the	end	of	the	cold	war	.
let	's	have	a	department	of	war	,	and	a	department	of	something	else	.
some	people	say	,	``	hell	,	9/11	did	it	for	you	.	``
now	we	've	got	a	home	game	and	an	away	game	.
the	department	of	homeland	security	is	a	strategic	feel	good	measure	.
it	's	going	to	be	the	department	of	agriculture	for	the	21st	century	.
tsa	--	thousands	standing	around	.
just	be	grateful	robert	reed	did	n't	shove	that	bomb	up	his	ass	.
because	we	'd	all	be	gay	then	.
i	supported	the	war	in	iraq	.
he	was	a	bad	guy	with	multiple	priors	.
it	's	not	like	we	had	to	find	him	actually	killing	somebody	live	to	arrest	him	.
i	knew	we	'd	kick	ass	in	the	war	with	the	leviathan	force	.
i	knew	we	'd	have	a	hard	time	with	what	followed	.
but	i	know	this	organization	does	n't	change	until	it	experiences	failure	.
what	do	i	mean	by	these	two	different	forces	?
this	is	the	hobbesian	force	.
i	love	this	force	.	i	do	n't	want	to	see	it	go	.	that	plus	nukes	rules	out	great	power	war	.
this	is	the	military	the	rest	of	the	world	wants	us	to	build	.
it	's	why	i	travel	all	over	the	world	talking	to	foreign	militaries	.
what	does	this	mean	?
it	means	you	've	got	to	stop	pretending	you	can	do	these	two	very	disparate	skill	sets	with	the	same	19	-	year	-	old	.
switching	back	,	morning	,	afternoon	,	evening	,	morning	,	afternoon	,	evening	.
handing	out	aid	,	shooting	back	,	handing	out	aid	,	shooting	back	.
it	's	too	much	.
the	19	-	year	-	olds	get	tired	from	the	switching	,	ok	?
that	force	on	the	left	,	you	can	train	a	19	-	year	-	old	to	do	that	.
that	force	on	the	right	is	more	like	a	40	-	year	-	old	cop	.
you	need	the	experience	.
what	does	this	mean	in	terms	of	operations	?
the	rule	is	going	to	be	this	.
that	sys	admin	force	is	the	force	that	never	comes	home	,	does	most	of	your	work	.
you	break	out	that	leviathan	force	only	every	so	often	.
but	here	's	the	promise	you	make	to	the	american	public	,	to	your	own	people	,	to	the	world	.
you	break	out	that	leviathan	force	,	you	promise	,	you	guarantee	that	you	're	going	to	mount	one	hell	of	a	--	immediately	--	follow	-	on	sys	admin	effort	.
do	n't	plan	for	the	war	unless	you	plan	to	win	the	peace	.
other	differences	.	leviathan	traditional	partners	,	they	all	look	like	the	brits	and	their	former	colonies	.
including	us	,	i	would	remind	you	.
the	rest	--	wider	array	of	partners	.
international	organizations	,	non	-	governmental	organizations	,	private	voluntary	organizations	,	contractors	.
you	're	not	going	to	get	away	from	that	.
leviathan	force	,	it	's	all	about	joint	operations	between	the	military	services	.
we	're	done	with	that	.
what	we	need	to	do	is	inter	-	agency	operations	,	which	frankly	condi	rice	was	in	charge	of	.
and	i	'm	amazed	nobody	asked	her	that	question	when	she	was	confirmed	.
i	call	the	leviathan	force	your	dad	's	military	.
i	like	them	young	,	male	,	unmarried	,	slightly	pissed	off	.
i	call	the	sys	admin	force	your	mom	's	military	.
it	's	everything	the	man	's	military	hates	.
gender	balanced	much	more	,	older	,	educated	,	married	with	children	.
the	force	on	the	left	,	up	or	out	.
the	force	on	the	right	,	in	and	out	.
the	force	on	the	left	respects	posse	comitatus	restrictions	on	the	use	of	force	inside	the	u.s	.
the	force	on	the	right	's	going	to	obliterate	it	.
that	's	where	the	national	guard	's	going	to	be	.
the	force	on	the	left	is	never	coming	under	the	purview	of	the	international	criminal	court	.
sys	admin	force	has	to	.
different	definitions	of	network	centricity	.
one	takes	down	networks	,	one	puts	them	up	.
and	you	've	got	to	wage	war	here	in	such	a	way	to	facilitate	that	.
do	we	need	a	bigger	budget	?
do	we	need	a	draft	to	pull	this	off	?
absolutely	not	.
i	've	been	told	by	the	revolution	of	military	affairs	crowd	for	years	,	we	can	do	it	faster	,	cheaper	,	smaller	,	just	as	lethal	.
i	say	,	``	great	,	i	'm	going	to	take	the	sys	admin	budget	out	of	your	hide	.	``	here	's	the	larger	point	.
you	're	going	to	build	the	sys	admin	force	inside	the	u.s.	military	first	.
but	ultimately	you	're	going	to	civilianize	it	,	probably	two	thirds	.
inter	agency	-	ize	it	,	internationalize	it	.
so	yes	,	it	begins	inside	the	pentagon	,	but	over	time	it	's	going	to	cross	that	river	.
i	have	been	to	the	mountain	top	.	i	can	see	the	future	.
i	may	not	live	long	enough	to	get	you	there	,	but	it	's	going	to	happen	.
we	're	going	to	have	a	department	of	something	else	between	war	and	peace	.
last	slide	.
who	gets	custody	of	the	kids	?
this	is	where	the	marines	in	the	audience	get	kind	of	tense	.
and	this	is	when	they	think	about	beating	the	crap	out	of	me	after	the	talk	.
read	max	boon	.
this	is	the	history	of	the	marines	--	small	wars	,	small	arms	.
the	marines	are	like	my	west	highland	terrier	.
they	get	up	every	morning	,	they	want	to	dig	a	hole	and	they	want	to	kill	something	.
i	do	n't	want	my	marines	handing	out	aid	.	i	want	them	to	be	marines	.
that	's	what	keeps	the	sys	admin	force	from	being	a	pussy	force	.
it	keeps	it	from	being	the	u.n	.
you	shoot	at	these	people	the	marines	are	going	to	come	over	and	kill	you	.
department	of	navy	,	strategic	subs	go	this	way	,	surface	combatants	are	over	there	,	and	the	news	is	they	may	actually	be	that	small	.
i	call	it	the	smart	dust	navy	.
i	tell	young	officers	,	``	you	may	command	500	ships	in	your	career	.	bad	news	is	they	may	not	have	anybody	on	them	.	``
carriers	go	both	ways	because	they	're	a	swing	asset	.
you	'll	see	the	pattern	--	airborne	,	just	like	carriers	.
armor	goes	this	way	.
here	's	the	dirty	secret	of	the	air	force	,	you	can	win	by	bombing	.
but	you	need	lots	of	these	guys	on	the	ground	to	win	the	peace	.
shinseki	was	right	with	the	argument	.
air	force	,	strategic	airlift	goes	both	ways	.
bombers	,	fighters	go	over	here	.
special	operations	command	down	at	tampa	.
trigger	-	pullers	go	this	way	.
civil	affairs	,	that	bastard	child	,	comes	over	here	.
return	to	the	army	.
the	point	about	the	trigger	-	pullers	and	special	operations	command	.
no	off	season	,	these	guys	are	always	active	.
they	drop	in	,	do	their	business	,	disappear	.
see	me	now	.	do	n't	talk	about	it	later	.
i	was	never	here	.
the	world	is	my	playground	.
i	want	to	keep	trigger	-	pullers	trigger	-	happy	.
i	want	the	rules	to	be	as	loose	as	possible	.
because	when	the	thing	gets	prevented	in	chicago	with	the	three	million	dead	that	perverts	our	political	system	beyond	all	recognition	,	these	are	the	guys	who	are	going	to	kill	them	first	.
so	it	's	better	off	to	have	them	make	some	mistakes	along	the	way	than	to	see	that	.
reserve	component	--	national	guard	reserves	overwhelmingly	sys	admin	.
how	are	you	going	to	get	them	to	work	for	this	force	?
most	firemen	in	this	country	do	it	for	free	.
this	is	not	about	money	.
this	is	about	being	up	front	with	these	guys	and	gals	.
last	point	,	intelligence	community	--	the	muscle	and	the	defense	agencies	go	this	way	.
what	should	be	the	cia	,	open	,	analytical	,	open	source	should	come	over	here	.
the	information	you	need	to	do	this	is	not	secret	.
it	's	not	secret	.
read	that	great	piece	in	the	new	yorker	about	how	our	echo	boomers	,	19	to	25	,	over	in	iraq	taught	each	other	how	to	do	sys	admin	work	,	over	the	internet	in	chat	rooms	.
they	said	,	``	al	qaeda	could	be	listening	.	``	they	said	,	``	well	,	jesus	,	they	already	know	this	stuff	.	``	take	a	gift	in	the	left	hand	.
these	are	the	sunglasses	that	do	n't	scare	people	,	simple	stuff	.
censors	and	transparency	,	the	overheads	go	in	both	directions	.
thanks	.
