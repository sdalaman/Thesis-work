i	'm	a	writer	and	a	journalist	,	and	i	'm	also	an	insanely	curious	person	,
so	in	22	years	as	a	journalist	,	i	've	learned	how	to	do	a	lot	of	new	things	.
and	three	years	ago	,	one	of	the	things	i	learned	how	to	do	was	to	become	invisible	.
i	became	one	of	the	working	homeless	.
i	quit	my	job	as	a	newspaper	editor	after	my	father	died	in	february	of	that	same	year	,	and	decided	to	travel	.
his	death	hit	me	pretty	hard	.
and	there	were	a	lot	of	things	that	i	wanted	to	feel	and	deal	with	while	i	was	doing	that	.
i	've	camped	my	whole	life	.	and	i	decided	that	living	in	a	van	for	a	year	to	do	this	would	be	like	one	long	camping	trip	.
so	i	packed	my	cat	,	my	rottweiler	and	my	camping	gear	into	a	1975	chevy	van	,	and	drove	off	into	the	sunset	,	having	fully	failed	to	realize	three	critical	things	.
one	:	that	society	equates	living	in	a	permanent	structure	,	even	a	shack	,	with	having	value	as	a	person	.
two	:	i	failed	to	realize	how	quickly	the	negative	perceptions	of	other	people	can	impact	our	reality	,	if	we	let	it	.
three	:	i	failed	to	realize	that	homelessness	is	an	attitude	,	not	a	lifestyle	.
at	first	,	living	in	the	van	was	great	.
i	showered	in	campgrounds	.	i	ate	out	regularly	.
and	i	had	time	to	relax	and	to	grieve	.
but	then	the	anger	and	the	depression	about	my	father	's	death	set	in	.	my	freelance	job	ended	.	and	i	had	to	get	a	full	-	time	job	to	pay	the	bills	.
what	had	been	a	really	mild	spring	turned	into	a	miserably	hot	summer	.
and	it	became	impossible	to	park	anywhere	--	--	without	being	very	obvious	that	i	had	a	cat	and	a	dog	with	me	,	and	it	was	really	hot	.
the	cat	came	and	went	through	an	open	window	in	the	van	.
the	doggy	went	into	doggy	day	care	.
and	i	sweated	.
whenever	i	could	,	i	used	employee	showers	in	office	buildings	and	truck	stops	.	or	i	washed	up	in	public	rest	rooms	.
nighttime	temperatures	in	the	van	rarely	dropped	below	80	degrees	fahrenheit	,	making	it	difficult	or	impossible	to	sleep	.
food	rotted	in	the	heat	.
ice	in	my	ice	chest	melted	within	hours	,	and	it	was	pretty	miserable	.
i	could	n't	afford	to	find	an	apartment	,	or	could	n't	afford	an	apartment	that	would	allow	me	to	have	the	rottweiler	and	the	cat	.
and	i	refused	to	give	them	up	,
so	i	stayed	in	the	van	.
and	when	the	heat	made	me	too	sick	to	walk	the	50	feet	to	the	public	restroom	outside	my	van	at	night	,	i	used	a	bucket	and	a	trash	bag	as	a	toilet	.
when	winter	weather	set	in	,	the	temperatures	dropped	below	freezing	.	and	they	stayed	there	.
and	i	faced	a	whole	new	set	of	challenges	.
i	parked	a	different	place	every	night	so	i	would	avoid	being	noticed	and	hassled	by	the	police	.
i	did	n't	always	succeed	.
but	i	felt	out	of	control	of	my	life	.
and	i	do	n't	know	when	or	how	it	happened	,	but	the	speed	at	which	i	went	from	being	a	talented	writer	and	journalist	to	being	a	homeless	woman	,	living	in	a	van	,	took	my	breath	away	.
i	had	n't	changed	.	my	i.q	.	had	n't	dropped	.
my	talent	,	my	integrity	,	my	values	,	everything	about	me	remained	the	same	.
but	i	had	changed	somehow	.
i	spiraled	deeper	and	deeper	into	a	depression	.
and	eventually	someone	referred	me	to	a	homeless	health	clinic	.
and	i	went	.	i	had	n't	bathed	in	three	days	.
i	was	as	smelly	and	as	depressed	as	anyone	in	line	.
i	just	was	n't	drunk	or	high	.
and	when	several	of	the	homeless	men	realized	that	,	including	a	former	university	professor	,	they	said	,	``	you	are	n't	homeless	.	why	are	you	really	here	?	``
other	homeless	people	did	n't	see	me	as	homeless	,	but	i	did	.
then	the	professor	listened	to	my	story	and	he	said	,	``	you	have	a	job	.	you	have	hope	.
the	real	homeless	do	n't	have	hope	.	``
a	reaction	to	the	medication	the	clinic	gave	me	for	my	depression	left	me	suicidal	.	and	i	remember	thinking	,	``	if	i	killed	myself	,	no	one	would	notice	.	``
a	friend	told	me	,	shortly	after	that	,	that	she	had	heard	that	tim	russert	,	a	nationally	renowned	journalist	,	had	been	talking	about	me	on	national	t.v	.
an	essay	i	'd	written	about	my	father	,	the	year	before	he	died	,	was	in	tim	's	new	book	.
and	he	was	doing	the	talk	show	circuit	.	and	he	was	talking	about	my	writing	.
and	when	i	realized	that	tim	russert	,	former	moderator	of	``	meet	the	press	,	``	was	talking	about	my	writing	,	while	i	was	living	in	a	van	in	a	wal	-	mart	parking	lot	,	i	started	laughing	.
you	should	too	.
i	started	laughing	because	it	got	to	the	point	where	,	was	i	a	writer	,	or	was	i	a	homeless	woman	?
so	i	went	in	the	bookstore	.	and	i	found	tim	's	book	.
and	i	stood	there	.	and	i	reread	my	essay	.
and	i	cried	.
because	i	was	a	writer	.
i	was	a	writer	.
shortly	after	that	i	moved	back	to	tennessee	.
i	alternated	between	living	in	a	van	and	couch	surfing	with	friends	.
and	i	started	writing	again	.
by	the	summer	of	the	following	year	i	was	a	working	journalist	.
i	was	winning	awards	.	i	was	living	in	my	own	apartment	.
i	was	no	longer	homeless	.
and	i	was	no	longer	invisible	.
thousands	of	people	work	full	and	part	-	time	jobs	,	and	live	in	their	cars	.
but	society	continues	to	stigmatize	and	criminalize	living	in	your	vehicle	or	on	the	streets	.
so	the	homeless	,	the	working	homeless	,	primarily	remain	invisible	.
but	if	you	ever	meet	one	,	engage	them	,	encourage	them	,	and	offer	them	hope	.
the	human	spirit	can	overcome	anything	if	it	has	hope	.
and	i	'm	not	here	to	be	the	poster	girl	for	the	homeless	.
i	'm	not	here	to	encourage	you	to	give	money	to	the	next	panhandler	you	meet	.
but	i	am	here	to	tell	you	that	,	based	on	my	experience	,	people	are	not	where	they	live	,	where	they	sleep	,	or	what	their	life	situation	is	at	any	given	time	.
three	years	ago	i	was	living	in	a	van	in	a	wal	-	mart	parking	lot	,
and	today	i	'm	speaking	at	ted	.
hope	always	,	always	finds	a	way	.	thank	you	.
