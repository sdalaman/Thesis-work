the filmmaker georges méliès was first a magician .
now movies proved to be the ultimate medium for magic .
with complete control of everything the audience can see , moviemakers had developed an arsenal of techniques to further their deceptions .
motion pictures are themselves an illusion of life , produced by the sequential projection of still frames , and they astonished the lumière brothers ' early audiences .
even today 's sophisticated moviegoers still lose themselves to the screen , and filmmakers leverage this separation from reality to great effect .
now imaginative people have been having fun with this for over 400 years .
giambattista della porta , a neapolitan scholar in the 16th century , examined and studied the natural world and saw how it could be manipulated .
playing with the world , and our perception of it , really is the essence of visual effects .
so digging deeper into this with the science and technology council of the academy of motion picture arts and sciences reveals some truth behind the trickery .
visual effects are based on the principles of all illusions : assumption , things are as we know them ; presumption , things will behave as we expect ; and context in reality , our knowledge of the world as we know it , such as scale .
now a fourth factor really becomes an obsession , which is , never betray the illusion .
and that last point has made visual effects a constant quest for perfection .
so from the hand - cranked jump cut early days of cinema to last sunday 's oscar winner , what follows are some steps and a few repeats in the evolution of visual effects .
i hope you will enjoy .
