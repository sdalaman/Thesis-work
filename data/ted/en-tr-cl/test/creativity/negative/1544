this story starts : i was at a friend 's house , and she had on her shelf a copy of the dsm manual , which is the manual of mental disorders .
it lists every known mental disorder .
and it used to be , back in the '50s , a very slim pamphlet .
and then it got bigger and bigger and bigger , and now it 's 886 pages long .
and it lists currently 374 mental disorders .
so i was leafing through it , wondering if i had any mental disorders , and it turns out i 've got 12 .
i 've got generalized anxiety disorder , which is a given .
i 've got nightmare disorder , which is categorized if you have recurrent dreams of being pursued or declared a failure -- and all my dreams involve people chasing me down the street going , " you 're a failure . "
i 've got parent - child relational problems , which i blame my parents for .
i 'm kidding . i 'm not kidding .
i 'm kidding .
and i 've got malingering .
and i think it 's actually quite rare to have both malingering and generalized anxiety disorder , because malingering tends to make me feel very anxious .
anyway i was looking through this book , wondering if i was much crazier than i thought i was , or maybe it 's not a good idea to diagnose yourself with a mental disorder if you 're not a trained professional , or maybe the psychiatry profession has a strange desire to label what 's essentially normal human behavior as a mental disorder .
i did n't know which of these things was true , but i thought it was kind of interesting .
and i thought maybe i should meet a critic of psychiatry to get their view .
which is how i ended up having lunch with the scientologists .
it was a man called brian who runs a crack team of scientologists who are determined to destroy psychiatry wherever it lies .
they 're called the cchr .
and i said to him , " can you prove to me that psychiatry is a pseudo - science that ca n't be trusted ? "
and he said , " yes , we can prove it to you . "
and i said , " how ? "
and he said , " we 're going to introduce you to tony . "
and i said , " who 's tony ? "
and he said , " tony 's in broadmoor . "
now broadmoor is broadmoor hospital .
it used to be known as the broadmoor asylum for the criminally insane .
it 's where they send the serial killers and the people who ca n't help themselves .
and i said to brian , " what did tony do ? "
and he said , " hardly anything .
he beat someone up or something , and he decided to fake madness to get out of a prison sentence .
but he faked it too well , and now he 's stuck in broadmoor and nobody will believe he 's sane .
do you want us to try and get you into broadmoor to meet tony ? "
so i said , " yes , please . "
so i got the train to broadmoor .
i began to yawn uncontrollably around kempton park , which apparently is what dogs also do when anxious -- they yawn uncontrollably .
and we got to broadmoor .
and i got taken through gate after gate after gate after gate into the wellness center , which is where you get to meet the patients .
it looks like a giant hampton inn .
it 's all peach and pine and calming colors .
and the only bold colors are the reds of the panic buttons .
and the patients started drifting in .
and they were quite overweight and wearing sweatpants and quite docile looking .
and brian the scientologist whispered to me , " they 're medicated , " which to the scientologists is like the worst evil in the world , but i 'm thinking it 's probably a good idea .
and then brian said , " here 's tony . "
and a man was walking in .
and he was n't overweight , he was in very good physical shape .
and he was n't wearing sweatpants , he was wearing a pinstriped suit .
and he had his arm outstretched like someone out of the apprentice .
he looked like a man who wanted to wear an outfit that would convince me that he was very sane .
and he sat down .
and i said , " so is it true that you faked your way in here ? "
and he said , " yep . yep . absolutely . i beat someone up when i was 17 .
and i was in prison awaiting trial , and my cellmate said to me , ' you know what you have to do ?
fake madness .
tell them you 're mad . you 'll get sent to some cushy hospital .
nurses will bring you pizzas .
you 'll have your own playstation . ' " so i said , " well how did you do it ? "
he said , " i asked to see the prison psychiatrist .
and i 'd just seen a film called ' crash ' in which people get sexual pleasure from crashing cars into walls .
so i said to the psychiatrist , ' i get sexual pleasure from crashing cars into walls . ' " and i said , " what else ? "
he said , " oh , yeah . i told the psychiatrist that i wanted to watch women as they died because it would make me feel more normal . "
and i said , " where 'd you get that from ? "
he said , " oh , from a biography of ted bundy that they had at the prison library . "
anyway he faked madness too well , he said .
and they did n't send him to some cushy hospital .
they sent him to broadmoor .
and the minute he got there , he said he took one look at the place , asked to see the psychiatrist , said , " there 's been a terrible misunderstanding .
i 'm not mentally ill. "
i said , " how long have you been here for ? "
he said , " well , if i 'd just done my time in prison for the original crime , i 'd have got five years .
i 've been in broadmoor for 12 years . "
tony said that it 's a lot harder to convince people you 're sane than it is to convince them you 're crazy .
he said , " i thought the best way to seem normal would be to talk to people normally about normal things like football or what 's on tv .
i subscribe to new scientist , and recently it had an article about how the u.s. army was training bumblebees to sniff out explosives .
so i said to a nurse , ' did you know that the u.s. army is training bumblebees to sniff out explosives ? ' when i read my medical notes , i saw they 'd written : ' believes bees can sniff out explosives . ' " he said , " you know , they 're always looking out for non - verbal clues to my mental state .
but how do you sit in a sane way ?
how do you cross your legs in a sane way ?
it 's just impossible . "
and when tony said that to me , i thought to myself , " am i sitting like a journalist ?
am i crossing my legs like a journalist ? "
he said , " you know , i 've got the stockwell strangler on one side of me and i 've got the ' tiptoe through the tulips ' rapist on the other side of me .
so i tend to stay in my room a lot because i find them quite frightening .
and they take that as a sign of madness .
they say it proves that i 'm aloof and grandiose . "
so only in broadmoor would not wanting to hang out with serial killers be a sign of madness .
anyway he seemed completely normal to me -- but what did i know ?
and when i got home i emailed his clinician , anthony maden .
i said , " what 's the story ? "
and he said , " yep . we accept that tony faked madness to get out of a prison sentence because his hallucinations that had seemed quite clich√© to begin with just vanished the minute he got to broadmoor .
however , we have assessed him .
and we have determined that what he is is a psychopath . "
and in fact , faking madness is exactly the kind of cunning and manipulative act of a psychopath .
it 's on the checklist : cunning and manipulative .
so faking your brain going wrong is evidence that your brain has gone wrong .
and i spoke to other experts , and they said the pinstriped suit -- classic psychopath .
speaks to items one and two on the checklist -- glibness , superficial charm and grandiose sense of self - worth .
and i said , " well , what , he did n't want to hang out with the other patients ? "
classic psychopath -- it speaks to grandiosity and also lack of empathy .
so all the things that had seemed most normal about tony was evidence , according to his clinician , that he was mad in this new way .
he was a psychopath .
and his clinician said to me , " if you want to know more about psychopaths , you can go on a psychopath spotting course run by robert hare who invented the psychopath checklist . "
so i did .
i went on a psychopath spotting course , and i am now a certified -- and i have to say , extremely adept -- psychopath spotter .
so here 's the statistics : one in a hundred regular people is a psychopath .
so there 's 1,500 people in his room .
fifteen of you are psychopaths .
although that figure rises to four percent of ceo 's and business leaders .
so i think there 's a very good chance there 's about 30 or 40 psychopaths in this room .
it could be carnage by the end of the night .
hare said the reason why is because capitalism at its most ruthless rewards psychopathic behavior -- the lack of empathy , the glibness , cunning , manipulative .
in fact , capitalism , perhaps at its most remorseless , is a physical manifestation of psychopathy .
it 's like a form of psychopathy that 's come down to affect us all .
and hare said to me , " you know what ? forget about some guy at broadmoor who may or may not have faked madness .
who cares ? that 's not a big story .
the big story , " he said , " is corporate psychopathy .
you want to go and interview yourself some corporate psychopaths . "
so i gave it a try . i wrote to the enron people .
i said , " could i come and interview you in prison to find out it you 're psychopaths ? "
and they did n't reply .
so i changed tack .
i emailed " chainsaw al " dunlap , the asset stripper from the 1990s .
he would come into failing businesses and close down 30 percent of the workforce , just turn american towns into ghost towns .
and i emailed him and i said , " i believe you may have a very special brain anomaly that makes you special and interested in the predatory spirit and fearless .
can i come and interview you about your special brain anomaly ? "
and he said , " come on over . "
so i went to al dunlap 's grand florida mansion that was filled with sculptures of predatory animals .
there were lions and tigers .
he was taking me through the garden .
there were falcons and eagles .
he was saying to me , " over there you 've got sharks . "
he was saying this in a less effeminate way .
" you 've got more sharks and you 've got tigers . "
it was like narnia .
and then we went into his kitchen .
now al dunlap would be brought in to save failing companies .
he 'd close down 30 percent of the workforce .
and he 'd quite often fire people with a joke .
for instance , one famous story about him , somebody came up to him and said , " i 've just bought myself a new car . "
and he said , " you may have a new car , but i 'll tell you what you do n't have , a job . "
so in his kitchen -- he was standing there with his wife , judy , and his bodyguard sean -- and i said , " you know how i said in my email that you might have a special brain anomaly that makes you special ? "
he said , " yeah , it 's an amazing theory .
it 's like star trek . you 're going where no man has gone before . "
and i said , " well , some psychologists might say that this makes you ... " and he said , " what ? "
and i said , " a psychopath . "
and i said , " i 've got a list of psychopathic traits in my pocket .
can i go through them with you ? "
and he looked intrigued despite himself , and he said , " okay , go on . "
and i said , " okay . grandiose sense of self - worth . "
which , i have to say , would have been hard for him to deny because he was standing underneath a giant oil painting of himself .
he said , " well , you 've got to believe in you ! "
and i said , " manipulative . "
he said , " that 's leadership . "
and i said , " shallow affect : an inability to experience a range of emotions . "
he said , " who wants to be weighed down by some nonsense emotions ? "
so he was going down the psychopathic checklist , basically turning it into " who moved my cheese ? "
but i did notice something happening to me the day i was with al dunlap .
whenever he said anything to me that was kind of normal -- like he said no to juvenile delinquency .
he said he got accepted into west point , and they do n't let delinquents in west point .
he said no to many short - term marital relationships .
he 's only ever been married twice .
admittedly , his first wife cited in her divorce papers that he once threatened her with a knife and said he always wondered what human flesh tasted like , but people say stupid things to each other in bad marriages in the heat of an argument and his second marriage has lasted 41 years .
so whenever he said anything to me that just seemed kind of non - psychopathic , i thought to myself , well i 'm not going to put that in my book .
and then i realized that becoming a psychopath spotter had turned me a little bit psychopathic .
because i was desperate to shove him in a box marked psychopath .
i was desperate to define him by his maddest edges .
and i realized , oh my god . this is what i 've been doing for 20 years .
it 's what all journalists do .
we travel across the world with our notepads in our hands , and we wait for the gems .
and the gems are always the outermost aspects of our interviewee 's personality .
and we stitch them together like medieval monks .
and we leave the normal stuff on the floor .
and this is a country that over - diagnoses certain mental disorders hugely .
childhood bipolar -- children as young as four are being labeled bipolar because they have temper tantrums , which scores them high on their bipolar checklist .
when i got back to london , tony phoned me .
he said , " why have n't you been returning my calls ? "
i said , " well they say that you 're a psychopath . "
and he said , " i 'm not a psychopath . "
he said , " you know what , one of the items on the checklist is lack of remorse , but another item on the checklist is cunning , manipulative .
so when you say you feel remorse for your crime , they say , ' typical of the psychopath to cunningly say he feels remorse when he does n't . ' it 's like witchcraft . they turn everything upside - down . "
he said , " i 've got a tribunal coming up .
will you come to it ? "
so i said okay .
so i went to his tribunal .
and after 14 years in broadmoor , they let him go .
they decided that he should n't be held indefinitely because he scores high on a checklist that might mean that he would have a greater than average chance of recidivism .
so they let him go .
and outside in the corridor he said to me , " you know what , jon ?
everyone 's a bit psychopathic . "
he said , " you are . i am. well obviously i am. "
i said , " what are you going to do now ? "
he said , " i 'm going to go to belgium because there 's a woman there that i fancy .
but she 's married , so i 'm going to have to get her split up from her husband . "
anyway , that was two years ago , and that 's where my book ended .
and for the last 20 months everything was fine .
nothing bad happened .
he was living with a girl outside london .
he was , according to brian the scientologist , making up for lost time -- which i know sounds ominous , but is n't necessarily ominous .
unfortunately , after 20 months , he did go back to jail for a month .
he got into a fracas in a bar , he called it -- ended up going to jail for a month , which i know is bad , but at least a month implies that whatever the fracas was , it was n't too bad .
and then he phoned me .
and you know what , i think it 's right that tony is out .
because you should n't define people by their maddest edges .
and what tony is , is he 's a semi - psychopath .
he 's a gray area in a world that does n't like gray areas .
but the gray areas are where you find the complexity , it 's where you find the humanity and it 's where you find the truth .
and tony said to me , " jon , could i buy you a drink in a bar ?
i just want to thank you for everything you 've done for me . "
and i did n't go . what would you have done ?
thank you .
