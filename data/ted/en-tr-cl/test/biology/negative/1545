newscaster : there 's a large path of destruction here in town .
... hit here pulling trees from the ground , shattering windows , taking the roofs off of homes .
caitria o'neill : that was me in front of our house in monson , massachusetts last june .
after an ef 3 tornado ripped straight through our town and took parts of our roof off , i decided to stay in massachusetts instead of pursuing the master 's program i had moved my boxes home that afternoon for .
morgan o'neill : so , on june 1st we were n't disaster experts , but on june 3rd we started faking it .
this experience changed our lives .
and now we 're trying to change the experience .
co : so tornadoes do n't happen in massachusetts .
and i was cleverly standing in the front yard when one came over the hill .
after a lamppost flew by , my family and i sprinted into the basement .
trees were thrown against the house , the windows exploded .
when we finally got out the back door , transformers were burning in the street .
mo : so i was here in boston .
i 'm a phd student at mit , and i happen to study atmospheric science .
actually it gets weirder .
so i was in the museum of science at the time the tornado hit , playing with the tornado display .
so i missed her call .
so i get the call from caitria , i hear the news , and i start tracking the radar online to call the family back when another supercell was forming in their area .
and i drove home late that night with batteries and ice .
we live across the street from an historic church that had lost its very iconic steeple in the storm .
it had become a community gathering place overnight .
the town hall and the police department had also suffered direct hits , and so people wanting to help or needing information went to the church .
co : we walked up to the church because we heard that they had hot meals , but when we arrived we found problems .
there were a couple large , sweaty men with chainsaws standing in the center of the church , but nobody knew where to send them because no one knew the extent of the damage yet .
and as we watched , they became frustrated and left to go find somebody to help on their own .
mo : so we started organizing .
why ? it had to be done . we found pastor bob and offered to give the response some infrastructure .
and then armed with just two laptops and one aircard , co : that was a tornado , and everyone 's heading to the church to drop things off and volunteer .
mo : everyone 's donating clothing .
we should really inventory the donations that are piling up here .
co : yeah , and we need a hotline . can you make a google voice number ?
mo : yeah , sure . and we need to tell people what not to bring .
i 'll make a facebook account . can you print fliers for the neighborhoods ?
co : yeah , but we do n't even know what houses are accepting help at this point .
we need to canvas and send out volunteers .
mo : we need to tell people what not to bring .
hey , there 's a news truck . i 'll tell them .
co : you got my number off the news ?
we do n't need any more freezers .
mo : the insurance wo n't cover it ? you need a crew to tar your roof ? co : six packs of juice boxes arriving in one hour ?
together : someone get me post - its !
co : and then the rest of the community figured out that we had answers .
mo : i can donate three water heaters , but someone needs to come pick them up .
co : my car is in my living room .
mo : my boyscout troop would like to rebuild 12 mailboxes .
co : the puppy 's missing , and insurance just does n't cover the chimneys .
mo : my church group of 50 would like housing and meals for a week co : you sent me to that place on washington street yesterday , and now i 'm covered in poison ivy .
so this is what filled our days .
we had to learn how to answer questions quickly and to solve problems in about a minute or less , because otherwise something more urgent would come up , and it just would n't get done .
mo : we did n't get our authority from the board of selectmen or the emergency management director or the united way .
we just started answering questions and making decisions because someone , anyone , had to .
and why not me ? i 'm a campaign organizer .
i 'm good at facebook .
and there 's two of me .
co : the point is , if there 's a flood or a fire or a hurricane , you , or somebody like you , are going to step up and start organizing things .
the other point is that it is hard .
mo : lying on the ground after another 17 - hour day , caitria and i would empty our pockets and try to place dozens of scraps of paper into context -- all bits of information that had to be remembered and matched in order to help someone .
after another day and a shower at the shelter , we realized it should n't be this hard .
co : in a country like ours where we breathe wi - fi , leveraging technology for a faster recovery should be a no - brainer .
systems like the ones that we were creating on the fly could exist ahead of time .
and if some community member is in this organizing position in every area after every disaster , these tools should exist .
mo : so we decided to build them -- a recovery in a box , something that could be deployed after every disaster by any local organizer .
co : i decided to stay in the country , give up the master 's in moscow and to work full - time to make this happen .
in the course of the past year , we 've become experts in the field of community - powered disaster recovery .
and there are three main problems that we 've observed with the way things work currently .
mo : the tools . large aid organizations are exceptional at bringing massive resources to bear after a disaster , but they often fulfill very specific missions and then they leave .
this leaves local residents to deal with the thousands of spontaneous volunteers , thousands of donations , and all with no training and no tools .
so they use post - its or excel or facebook .
but none of these tools allow you to value high - priority information amidst all of the photos and well wishes .
co : the timing .
disaster relief is essentially a backwards political campaign .
in a political campaign , you start with no interest and no capacity to turn that into action .
you build both gradually until a moment of peak mobilization at the time of the election .
in a disaster , however , you start with all of the interest and none of the capacity .
and you 've only got about seven days to capture 50 percent of all of the web searches that will ever be made to help your area .
then some sporting event happens , and you 've got only the resources that you 've collected thus far to meet the next five years of recovery needs .
this is the slide for katrina .
this is the curve for joplin .
and this is the curve for the dallas tornadoes in april where we deployed software .
there 's a gap here .
affected households have to wait for the insurance adjuster to visit before they can start accepting help on their properties .
and you 've only got about four days of interest in dallas .
mo : data .
data is inherently unsexy , but it can jumpstart an area 's recovery .
fema and the state will pay 85 percent of the cost of a federally declared disaster , leaving the town to pay last 15 percent of the bill .
now that expense can be huge , but if the town can mobilize x amount of volunteers for y hours , the dollar value of that labor used goes toward the town 's contribution .
but who knows that ?
now try to imagine the sinking feeling you get when you 've just sent out 2,000 volunteers and you ca n't prove it .
co : these are three problems with a common solution .
if we can get the right tools at the right time to the people who will inevitably step up and start putting their communities back together , we can create new standards in disaster recovery .
mo : we needed canvasing tools , donations databasing , needs reporting , remote volunteer access , all in an easy - to - use website .
co : and we needed help .
alvin , our software engineer and cofounder , has built these tools .
chris and bill have volunteered their time to use operations and partnerships .
and we 've been flying into disaster areas since this past january , setting up software , training residents and licensing the software to areas that are preparing for disasters .
mo : one of our first launches was after the dallas tornadoes this past april .
we flew into a town that had a static outdated website and a frenetic facebook feed trying to structure the response .
and we launched our platform .
all of the interest came in the first four days , but by the time they lost the news cycle , that 's when the needs came in , yet they had this massive resource of what people were able to give and they 've been able to meet the needs of their residents .
co : so it 's working , but it could be better .
emergency preparedness is a big deal in disaster recovery because it makes towns safer and more resilient .
imagine if we could have these systems ready to go in a place before a disaster .
so that 's what we 're working on .
we 're working on getting the software to places so people expect it , so people know how to use it and so it can be filled ahead of time with that microinformation that drives recovery .
mo : it 's not rocket science .
these tools are obvious and people want them .
in our hometown , we trained a half - dozen residents to run these web tools on their own .
because caitria and i live here in boston .
they took to it immediately , and now they are forces of nature .
there are over three volunteer groups working almost every day , and have been since june 1st of last year , to make sure that these residents get what they need and get back in their homes .
they have hotlines and spreadsheets and data .
co : and that makes a difference .
june 1st this year marked the one - year anniversary of the monson tornado .
and our community 's never been more connected or more empowered .
we 've been able to see the same transformation in texas and in alabama .
because it does n't take harvard or mit to fly in and fix problems after a disaster , it takes a local .
no matter how good an aid organization is at what they do , they eventually have to go home .
but if you give locals the tools , if you show them what they can do to recover , they become experts .
mo : all right . let 's go .
