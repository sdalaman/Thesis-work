today , i 'm going to talk to you about sketching electronics .
i 'm , among several other things , an electrical engineer , and that means that i spend a good amount of time designing and building new pieces of technology , and more specifically designing and building electronics .
and what i 've found is that the process of designing and building electronics is problematic in all sorts of ways .
so it 's a really slow process , it 's really expensive , and the outcome of that process , namely electronic circuit boards , are limited in all sorts of kind of interesting ways .
so they 're really small , generally , they 're square and flat and hard , and frankly , most of them just are n't very attractive , and so my team and i have been thinking of ways to really change and mix up the process and the outcome of designing electronics .
and so what if you could design and build electronics like this ? so what if you could do it extremely quickly , extremely inexpensively , and maybe more interestingly , really fluidly and expressively and even improvisationally ?
would n't that be so cool , and that would n't that open up all sorts of new possibilities ?
i 'm going to share with you two projects that are investigations along these lines , and we 'll start with this one .
magnetic electronic pieces and ferrous paper .
a conductive pen from the lewis lab at uiuc .
sticker templates .
speed x 4 .
making a switch .
music : dj shadow .
adding some intelligence with a microcontroller .
sketching an interface .
pretty cool , huh ? we think so .
so now that we developed these tools and found these materials that let us do these things , we started to realize that , essentially , anything that we can do with paper , anything that we can do with a piece of paper and a pen we can now do with electronics .
so the next project that i want to show you is kind of a deeper exploration of that possibility .
and i 'll kind of let it speak for itself .
so the next step for us in this process is now to find a way to let all of you build things like this , and so the way that we 're approaching that is by teaching workshops to people where we explain how they can use these kinds of tools , and then also working to get the tools and the materials and techniques out into the real world in a variety of ways .
and so sometime soon , you 'll be able to play and build and sketch with electronics in this fundamentally new way .
so thank you very much .
