chris anderson : you guys were amazing .
that 's amazing .
you just do n't hear that every day .
usman , the official story is that you learned to play the guitar by watching jimmy page on youtube .
usman riaz : yes , that was the first one . and then i -- that was the first thing i learned , and then i started progressing to other things .
and i started watching kaki king a lot , and she would always cite preston reed as a big influence , so then i started watching his videos , and it 's very surreal right now to be -- ca : was that piece just now , that was one of his songs that you learned , or how did that happen ?
ur : i 'd never learned it before , but he told me that we would be playing that on stage , so i was familiar with it , so that 's why i had so much more fun learning it .
and it finally happened , so ...
ca : preston , from your point of view , i mean , you invented this like 20 years ago , right ?
how does it feel to see someone like this come along taking your art and doing so much with it ?
preston reed : it 's mind - blowing , and i feel really proud , really honored .
and he 's a wonderful musician , so it 's cool .
ca : i guess , i do n't think there is like a one - minute other piece you guys can do ?
can you ? do you jam ? do you have anything else ?
pr : we have n't prepared anything .
ca : there is n't . i 'll tell you what .
if you have another 30 or 40 seconds , and you have another 30 or 40 seconds , and we just see that , i just think -- i can feel it . we want to hear a little more .
and if it goes horribly wrong , no worries .
