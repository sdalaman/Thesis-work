so i grew up in limpopo , on the border of limpopo and mpumalanga , a little town called motetema .
water and electricity supply are as unpredictable as the weather , and growing up in these tough situations , at the age of 17 , i was relaxing with a couple of friends of mine in winter , and we were sunbathing .
the limpopo sun gets really hot in winter .
so as we were sunbathing , my best friend next to me says , " man , why does n't somebody invent something that you can just put on your skin and then you do n't have to bathe ? "
and i sat , and i was like , " man , i would buy that , eh ? "
so i went home , and i did a little research , and i found some very shocking statistics .
over 2.5 billion people in the world today do not have proper access to water and sanitation .
four hundred and fifty million of them are in africa , and five million of them are in south africa .
various diseases thrive in this environment , the most drastic of which is called trachoma .
trachoma is an infection of the eye due to dirt getting into your eye . multiple infections of trachoma can leave you permanently blind .
the disease leaves eight million people permanently blind each and every year . the shocking part about it is that to avoid being infected with trachoma , all you have to do is wash your face : no medicine , no pills , no injections .
so after seeing these shocking statistics , i thought to myself , " okay , even if i 'm not just doing it for myself and the fact that i do n't want to bathe , i at least need to do it to try to save the world . "
so with my trusty little steed , my nokia 6234 cell phone -- i did n't have a laptop , i did n't have internet much , except for the 20 - rand - an - hour internet cafe -- i did research on wikipedia , on google , about lotions , creams , the compositions , the melting points , the toxicities -- i did high school science -- and i wrote down a little formula on a piece of paper , and it looked like the kfc special spice , you know ?
so i was like , okay , so we 've got the formula ready .
now we need to get this thing into practice .
fast forward four years later , after having written a 40 - page business plan on the cell phone , having written my patent on the cell phone , i 'm the youngest patent - holder in the country , and -- -- i ca n't say any more than that .
i had invented drybath , the world 's first bath - substituting lotion .
you literally put it on your skin , and you do n't have to bathe .
so after having tried to make it work in high school with the limited resources i had , i went to university , met a few people , got it into practice , and we have a fully functioning product that 's ready to go to the market . it 's actually available on the market .
so we learned a few lessons in commercializing and making drybath available .
one of the things we learned was that poor communities do n't buy products in bulk .
they buy products on demand . a person in alex does n't buy a box of cigarettes . they buy one cigarette each day , even though it 's more expensive .
so we packaged drybath in these innovative little sachets .
you just snap them in half , and you squeeze it out .
and the cool part is , one sachet substitutes one bath for five rand .
after creating that model , we also learned a lot in terms of implementing the product .
we realized that even rich kids from the suburbs really want drybath .
at least once a week .
anyway , we realized that we could save 80 million liters of water on average each time they skipped a bath , and also we would save two hours a day for kids who are in rural areas , two hours more for school , two hours more for homework , two hours more to just be a kid .
after seeing that global impact , we narrowed it down to our key value proposition , which was cleanliness and convenience .
drybath is a rich man 's convenience and a poor man 's lifesaver .
having put the product into practice , we are actually now on the verge of selling the product onto a multinational to take it to the retail market , and one question i have for the audience today is , on the gravel roads of limpopo , with an allowance of 50 rand a week , i came up with a way for the world not to bathe .
what 's stopping you ?
i 'm not done yet . i 'm not done yet .
and another key thing that i learned a lot throughout this whole process , last year google named me as one of the brightest young minds in the world .
i 'm also currently the best student entrepreneur in the world , the first african to get that accolade , and one thing that really puzzles me is , i did all of this just because i did n't want to bathe . thank you .
