i 'm a gamer , so i like to have goals .
i like special missions and secret objectives .
so here 's my special mission for this talk : i 'm going to try to increase the life span of every single person in this room by seven and a half minutes .
literally , you will live seven and half minutes longer than you would have otherwise , just because you watched this talk .
okay , some of you are looking a little bit skeptical .
that 's okay , because check it out -- i have math to prove that it is possible .
and it wo n't make a lot of sense now .
i 'll explain it all later , just pay attention to the number at the bottom : plus - 7.68245837 minutes that will be my gift to you if i 'm successful in my mission .
now , you have a secret mission too .
your mission is to figure out how you want to spend your extra seven and a half minutes .
and i think you should do something unusual with them , because these are bonus minutes . you were n't going to have them anyway .
now , because i 'm a game designer , you might be thinking to yourself , i know what she wants us to do with those minutes , she wants us to spend them playing games .
now this is a totally reasonable assumption , given that i have made quite a habit of encouraging people to spend more time playing games .
for example , in my first tedtalk , i did propose that we should spend 21 billion hours a week as a planet playing video games .
now , 21 billion hours , it 's a lot of time .
it 's so much time , in fact , that the number one unsolicited comment that i have heard from people all over the world since i gave that talk , is this : jane , games are great and all , but on your deathbed , are you really going to wish you spent more time playing angry birds ?
this idea is so pervasive -- that games are a waste of time that we will come to regret -- that i hear it literally everywhere i go .
for example , true story : just a few weeks ago , this cab driver , upon finding out that a friend and i were in town for a game developer 's conference , turned around and said -- and i quote -- " i hate games . waste of life . imagine getting to the end of your life and regretting all that time . "
now , i want to take this problem seriously .
i mean , i want games to be a force for good in the world .
i do n't want gamers to regret the time they spent playing , time that i encouraged them to spend .
so i have been thinking about this question a lot lately .
when we 're on our deathbeds , will we regret the time we spent playing games ?
now , this may surprise you , but it turns out there is actually some scientific research on this question .
it 's true . hospice workers , the people who take care of us at the end of our lives , recently issued a report on the most frequently expressed regrets that people say when they are literally on their deathbeds .
and that 's what i want to share with you today -- the top five regrets of the dying .
number one : i wish i had n't worked so hard .
number two : i wish i had stayed in touch with my friends .
number three : i wish i had let myself be happier .
number four : i wish i 'd had the courage to express my true self .
and number five : i wish i 'd lived a life true to my dreams , instead of what others expected of me .
now , as far as i know , no one ever told one of the hospice workers , i wish i 'd spent more time playing video games , but when i hear these top five regrets of the dying , i ca n't help but hear five deep human cravings that games actually help us fulfill .
for example , i wish i had n't worked so hard .
for many people , this means , i wish i 'd spent more time with my family , with my kids when they were growing up .
well , we know that playing games together has tremendous family benefits .
a recent study from brigham young university school of family life reported that parents who spend more time playing video games with their kids have much stronger real - life relationships with them .
i wish i 'd stayed in touch with my friends .
well , hundreds of millions of people use social games like farmville or words with friends to stay in daily contact with real - life friends and family .
a recent study from [ university of michigan ] showed that these games are incredibly powerful relationship - management tools .
they help us stay connected with people in our social network that we would otherwise grow distant from , if we were n't playing games together .
i wish i 'd let myself be happier .
well , here i ca n't help but think of the groundbreaking clinical trials recently conducted at east carolina university that showed that online games can outperform pharmaceuticals for treating clinical anxiety and depression .
just 30 minutes of online game play a day was enough to create dramatic boosts in mood and long - term increases in happiness .
i wish i 'd had the courage to express my true self .
well , avatars are a way to express our true selves , our most heroic , idealized version of who we might become .
you can see that in this alter ego portrait by robbie cooper of a gamer with his avatar .
and stanford university has been doing research for five years now to document how playing a game with an idealized avatar changes how we think and act in real life , making us more courageous , more ambitious , more committed to our goals .
i wish i 'd led a life true to my dreams , and not what others expected of me .
are games doing this yet ? i 'm not sure , so i 've left a question mark , a super mario question mark .
and we 're going to come back to this one .
but in the mean time , perhaps you 're wondering , who is this game designer to be talking to us about deathbed regrets ?
and it 's true , i 've never worked in a hospice , i 've never been on my deathbed .
but recently i did spend three months in bed , wanting to die .
really wanting to die .
now let me tell you that story .
it started two years ago , when i hit my head and got a concussion .
now the concussion did n't heal properly , and after 30 days i was left with symptoms like nonstop headaches , nausea , vertigo , memory loss , mental fog .
my doctor told me that in order to heal my brain , i had to rest it .
so i had to avoid everything that triggered my symptoms .
for me that meant no reading , no writing , no video games , no work or email , no running , no alcohol , no caffeine .
in other words -- and i think you see where this is going -- no reason to live .
of course it 's meant to be funny , but in all seriousness , suicidal ideation is quite common with traumatic brain injuries .
it happens to one in three , and it happened to me .
my brain started telling me , jane , you want to die .
it said , you 're never going to get better .
it said , the pain will never end .
and these voices became so persistent and so persuasive that i started to legitimately fear for my life , which is the time that i said to myself after 34 days -- and i will never forget this moment -- i said , i am either going to kill myself or i 'm going to turn this into a game .
now , why a game ?
i knew from researching the psychology of games for more than a decade that when we play a game -- and this is in the scientific literature -- we tackle tough challenges with more creativity , more determination , more optimism , and we 're more likely to reach out to others for help .
and i wanted to bring these gamer traits to my real - life challenge , so i created a role - playing recovery game called jane the concussion slayer .
now this became my new secret identity , and the first thing i did as a slayer was call my twin sister -- i have an identical twin sister named kelly -- and tell her , i 'm playing a game to heal my brain , and i want you to play with me .
this was an easier way to ask for help .
she became my first ally in the game , my husband kiyash joined next , and together we identified and battled the bad guys .
now this was anything that could trigger my symptoms and therefore slow down the healing process , things like bright lights and crowded spaces .
we also collected and activated power - ups .
this was anything i could do on even my worst day to feel just a little bit good , just a little bit productive .
things like cuddling my dog for 10 minutes , or getting out of bed and walking around the block just once .
now the game was that simple : adopt a secret identity , recruit your allies , battle the bad guys , activate the power - ups .
but even with a game so simple , within just a couple days of starting to play , that fog of depression and anxiety went away . it just vanished . it felt like a miracle .
now it was n't a miracle cure for the headaches or the cognitive symptoms .
that lasted for more than a year , and it was the hardest year of my life by far .
but even when i still had the symptoms , even while i was still in pain , i stopped suffering .
now what happened next with the game surprised me .
i put up some blog posts and videos online , explaining how to play .
but not everybody has a concussion , obviously , not everyone wants to be " the slayer , " so i renamed the game superbetter .
and soon i started hearing from people all over the world who were adopting their own secret identity , recruiting their own allies , and they were getting " super better " facing challenges like cancer and chronic pain , depression and crohn 's disease .
even people were playing it for terminal diagnoses like als .
and i could tell from their messages and their videos that the game was helping them in the same ways that it helped me .
they talked about feeling stronger and braver .
they talked about feeling better understood by their friends and family .
and they even talked about feeling happier , even though they were in pain , even though they were tackling the toughest challenge of their lives .
now at the time , i 'm thinking to myself , what is going on here ?
i mean , how could a game so trivial intervene so powerfully in such serious , and in some cases life - and - death , circumstances ?
i mean , if it had n't worked for me , there 's no way i would have believed it was possible .
well , it turns out there 's some science here too .
some people get stronger and happier after a traumatic event .
and that 's what was happening to us .
the game was helping us experience what scientists call post - traumatic growth , which is not something we usually hear about .
we usually hear about post - traumatic stress disorder .
but scientists now know that a traumatic event does n't doom us to suffer indefinitely .
instead , we can use it as a springboard to unleash our best qualities and lead happier lives .
here are the top five things that people with post - traumatic growth say : my priorities have changed . i 'm not afraid to do what makes me happy .
i feel closer to my friends and family .
i understand myself better . i know who i really am now .
i have a new sense of meaning and purpose in my life .
i 'm better able to focus on my goals and dreams .
now , does this sound familiar ?
it should , because the top five traits of post - traumatic growth are essentially the direct opposite of the top five regrets of the dying .
now this is interesting , right ?
it seems that somehow , a traumatic event can unlock our ability to lead a life with fewer regrets .
but how does it work ?
how do you get from trauma to growth ?
or better yet , is there a way to get all the benefits of post - traumatic growth without the trauma , without having to hit your head in the first place ?
that would be good , right ?
i wanted to understand the phenomenon better , so i devoured the scientific literature , and here 's what i learned .
there are four kinds of strength , or resilience , that contribute to post - traumatic growth , and there are scientifically validated activities that you can do every day to build up these four kinds of resilience , and you do n't need a trauma to do it .
now , i could tell you what these four types of strength are , but i 'd rather you experience them firsthand .
i 'd rather we all start building them up together right now .
so here 's what we 're going to do .
we 're going to play a quick game together .
this is where you earn those seven and a half minutes of bonus life that i promised you earlier .
all you have to do is successfully complete the first four superbetter quests .
and i feel like you can do it . i have confidence in you .
so , everybody ready ? this is your first quest . here we go .
pick one : stand up and take three steps , or make your hands into fists , raise them over your head as high as you can for five seconds . go !
all right , i like the people doing both . you are overachievers .
very good .
well done , everyone . now that is worth plus - one physical resilience , which means that your body can withstand more stress and heal itself faster .
now we know from the research that the number one thing you can do to boost your physical resilience is to not sit still .
that 's all it takes .
every single second that you are not sitting still , you are actively improving the health of your heart , and your lungs and brains .
everybody ready for your next quest ?
i want you to snap your fingers exactly 50 times , or count backwards from 100 by seven , like this : 100 , 93 ...
go !
do n't give up .
do n't let the people counting down from 100 interfere with your counting to 50 .
nice . wow . that 's the first time i 've ever seen that .
bonus physical resilience . well done , everyone .
now that 's worth plus - one mental resilience , which means you have more mental focus , more discipline , determination and willpower .
we know from the scientific research that willpower actually works like a muscle .
it gets stronger the more you exercise it .
so tackling a tiny challenge without giving up , even one as absurd as snapping your fingers exactly 50 times or counting backwards from 100 by seven is actually a scientifically validated way to boost your willpower .
so good job . quest number three .
pick one : now because of the room we 're in , fate 's really determined this for you , but here are the two options .
if you 're inside , find a window and look out of it .
if you 're outside , find a window and look in .
or do a quick youtube or google image search for " baby [ your favorite animal . ] " now , you could do this on your phones , or you could just shout out some baby animals , i 'm going to find some and put them on the screen for us .
so , what do we want to see ?
sloth , giraffe , elephant , snake . okay , let 's see what we got .
baby dolphin and baby llamas . everybody look .
got that ?
okay , one more . baby elephant .
we 're clapping for that ?
that 's amazing .
all right , now what we 're just feeling there is plus - one emotional resilience , which means you have the ability to provoke powerful , positive emotions like curiosity or love , which we feel when we look at baby animals , when you need them most .
and here 's a secret from the scientific literature for you .
if you can manage to experience three positive emotions for every one negative emotion over the course of an hour , a day , a week , you dramatically improve your health and your ability to successfully tackle any problem you 're facing .
and this is called the three - to - one positive emotion ratio .
it 's my favorite superbetter trick , so keep it up .
all right , pick one , last quest : shake someone 's hand for six seconds , or send someone a quick thank you by text , email , facebook or twitter . go !
looking good , looking good .
nice , nice .
keep it up . i love it !
all right , everybody , that is plus - one social resilience , which means you actually get more strength from your friends , your neighbors , your family , your community .
now , a great way to boost social resilience is gratitude .
touch is even better .
here 's one more secret for you : shaking someone 's hand for six seconds dramatically raises the level of oxytocin in your bloodstream , now that 's the trust hormone .
that means that all of you who just shook hands are biochemically primed to like and want to help each other .
this will linger during the break , so take advantage of the networking opportunities .
okay , well you have successfully completed your four quests , so let 's see if i 've successfully completed my mission to give you seven and a half minutes of bonus life .
and here 's where i get to share one more little bit of science with you .
it turns out that people who regularly boost these four types of resilience -- physical , mental , emotional and social -- live 10 years longer than everyone else .
so this is true .
if you are regularly achieving the three - to - one positive emotion ratio , if you are never sitting still for more than an hour at a time , if you are reaching out to one person you care about every single day , if you are tackling tiny goals to boost your willpower , you will live 10 years longer than everyone else , and here 's where that math i showed you earlier comes in .
so , the average life expectancy in the u.s. and the u.k. is 78.1 years , but we know from more than 1,000 peer - reviewed scientific studies that you can add 10 years of life to that by boosting your four types of resilience .
so every single year that you are boosting your four types of resilience , you 're actually earning .128 more years of life or 46 more days of life , or 67,298 more minutes of life , which means every single day , you are earning 184 minutes of life , or every single hour that you are boosting your four types of resilience , like we just did together , you are earning 7.68245837 more minutes of life .
congratulations , those seven and a half minutes are all yours . you totally earned them .
yeah ! awesome .
wait , wait , wait .
you still have your special mission , your secret mission .
how are you going to spend these seven and a half minutes of bonus life ?
well , here 's my suggestion .
these seven and a half bonus minutes are kind of like genie 's wishes .
you can use your first wish to wish for a million more wishes .
pretty clever , right ?
so , if you spend these seven and a half minutes today doing something that makes you happy , or that gets you physically active , or puts you in touch with someone you care about , or even just tackling a tiny challenge , you are going to boost your resilience , so you 're going to earn more minutes .
and the good news is , you can keep going like that .
every hour of the day , every day of your life , all the way to your deathbed , which will now be 10 years later than it would have otherwise .
and when you get there , more than likely , you will not have any of those top five regrets , because you will have built up the strength and resilience to lead a life truer to your dreams .
and with 10 extra years , you might even have enough time to play a few more games .
thank you .
