angella ahn : thank you .
thank you so much .
we are so honored to be here at tedwomen , sharing our music with you .
what an exciting and inspiring event .
what you just heard is " skylife " by david balakrishnan .
we want to play you one more selection .
it 's by astor piazzolla , an argentine composer .
and we talk about different ideas -- he had this idea that he thought music should be from the heart .
this was in the middle of the 20th century when music from the heart , beautiful music , was n't the most popular thing in the classical music world .
it was more atonal and twelve - tone .
and he insisted on beautiful music .
so this is " oblivion " by astor piazzolla .
thank you .
