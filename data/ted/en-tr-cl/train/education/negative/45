hi everyone . i 'm sirena .
i 'm 11 years old and from connecticut .
well , i 'm not really sure why i 'm here .
i mean , what does this have to do with technology , entertainment and design ?
well , i count my ipod , cellphone and computer as technology but this has nothing to do with that .
so i did a little research on it .
well , this is what i found .
of course , i hope i can memorize it .
the violin is basically made of a wood box and four main strings .
by playing the string , the string vibrates and produces a sound wave .
sound passes through a piece of wood called a bridge and goes down to the wood box and gets amplified but ... let me think .
okay . on the other hand by placing your finger in a different position on the fingerboard it changes the string length , that changes the frequency of the sound wave .
oh , my gosh !
okay . this is sort of a technology but i can call it a 16th - century technology .
but actually , the most fascinating thing that i found was that even the audio system or wave transmission nowadays are still basically based on the same principle of producing and projecting sound .
is n't that cool ?
design -- i love its design .
i remember when i was little my mom asked me , would you like to play the violin or the piano ?
i looked at that giant monster and said to myself -- i am not going to lock myself on that bench the whole day .
this is small and lightweight .
i can play from standing , sitting or walking .
and you know what ?
the best of all is that if i do n't want to practice , i can hide it .
the violin is very beautiful .
some people relate it as the shape of a lady but , whether you like it or not , it 's been so for more than 400 years , unlike modern stuff that easily looks dated .
but i think it 's very personal and unique that , although each violin looks pretty similar , that no two violins sound the same .
even from the same maker or based on the same model .
entertainment -- i love the entertainment , but actually , the instrument itself is n't very entertaining .
i mean , when i first got my violin and tried to play around , it was actually , really bad because it did n't sound like the way i 'd heard from other kids -- so horrible and so scratchy -- so it was n't entertaining at all .
but besides , my brother found this very funny .
yuk , yuk , yuk .
a few years later i heard a joke about the greatest violinist , jascha heifetz .
after mr. heifetz 's concert a lady came over and complimented , " oh , mr. heifetz , your violin sounded so great tonight . "
and mr. heifetz was a very cool person , so he picked up his violin and said , " funny , i do n't hear anything . "
and now , i realize that as the musician , we human beings , we have a great mind , artistic heart and skill that can change the 16th - century technology and a legendary design to a wonderful entertainment .
now , i know why i 'm here .
at first i thought i was just going to be here to perform , but unexpectedly , i learned and enjoyed much more .
but ... although some of them were quite up there for me .
like the multi - dimension stuff .
i mean , honestly , i 'd be happy enough if i can actually get my two dimension correct in school .
but actually , the most impressive thing to me is that ... well , actually , i would also like to stand this for all children is to say , thank you , to all adults for actually caring for us a lot and to make our future world much better .
thank you .
