thank you very much .
now , i 've got a story for you .
when i arrived off the plane , after a very long journey from the west of england , my computer , my beloved laptop , had gone mad , and had -- oh ! -- a bit like that ! -- and the display on it -- anyway , the whole thing had burst .
and i went to the it guys here and a gentleman mended my computer , and then he said , " what are you doing here ? "
and i said " i 'm playing the cello and i 'm doing a bit of singing , " and he said , " oh , i sort of play the cello as well . "
and i said , " do you really ? "
anyway , so you 're in for a treat , because he 's fantastic , and his name 's mark .
i am also joined by my partner in crime , thomas dolby .
this song is called " farther than the sun. "
♫ strung in the wind i called you ♫ ♫ but you did not hear ... ♫ ♫ and you 're a plant that needs poor soil ♫ ♫ and i have treated you too well ♫ ♫ to give up flowers ... ♫ ♫ oh , i have been too rich for you ... ♫ ♫ farther than the sun from me ♫ ♫ farther than i 'd have you be ♫ ♫ and i go north , i get so cold ♫ ♫ my heart is lava under stone ♫ ♫ you are not worthy ♫ ♫ you are not worthy ... ♫ ♫ with your calculating eyes ♫ ♫ spinning figures ♫ ♫ you cannot see me ♫ ♫ you cannot see me ... ♫ ♫ and if i tell myself enough ♫ ♫ i 'll believe it ♫ ♫ you are not worthy ♫ ♫ the sea , it freezes over ... ♫ ♫ to trap the light ♫ ♫ and i 'm in love with being in love ♫ ♫ and you were never quite the one ♫ ♫ in gerda 's eyes ♫ ♫ fragments of what you 've become ♫ ♫ and all the moths that fly at night ♫ ♫ believe electric light is bright ♫ ♫ you are not worthy ♫ ♫ you are not worthy ♫ ♫ with your calculating eyes ♫ ♫ spinning figures ♫ ♫ you cannot see me , no ♫ ♫ and if i tell myself enough ♫ ♫ i 'll believe it ♫ ♫ you are not worthy ♫ ♫ farther than the sun from me ♫ ♫ farther than i 'd have you be ♫ ♫ and i go north , i get so cold ♫ ♫ my heart is lava under stone ♫ ♫ you are not worthy ♫ ♫ you are not worthy ♫ ♫ with your calculating eyes ♫ ♫ spinning figures ♫ ♫ you cannot see me , no ... ♫ ♫ and if i tell myself enough , i 'll believe it ♫ thank you very much .
