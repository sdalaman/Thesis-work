you 've all seen lots of articles on climate change , and here 's yet another new york times article , just like every other darn one you 've seen .
it says all the same stuff as all the other ones you 've seen .
it even has the same amount of headline as all the other ones you 've seen .
what 's unusual about this one , maybe , is that it 's from 1953 .
and the reason i 'm saying this is that you may have the idea this problem is relatively recent .
that people have just sort of figured out about it , and now with kyoto and the governator and people beginning to actually do something , we may be on the road to a solution .
the fact is -- uh - uh .
we 've known about this problem for 50 years , depending on how you count it .
we have talked about it endlessly over the last decade or so .
and we 've accomplished close to zip .
this is the growth rate of co 2 in the atmosphere .
you 've seen this in various forms , but maybe you have n't seen this one .
what this shows is that the rate of growth of our emissions is accelerating .
and that it 's accelerating even faster than what we thought was the worst case just a few years back .
so that red line there was something that a lot of skeptics said the environmentalists only put in the projections to make the projections look as bad as possible , that emissions would never grow as fast as that red line .
but in fact , they 're growing faster .
here 's some data from actually just 10 days ago , which shows this year 's minimum of the arctic sea ice , and it 's the lowest by far .
and the rate at which the arctic sea ice is going away is a lot quicker than models .
so despite all sorts of experts like me flying around the planet and burning jet fuel , and politicians signing treaties -- in fact , you could argue the net effect of all this has been negative , because it 's just consumed a lot of jet fuel .
no , no ! in terms of what we really need to do to put the brakes on this very high inertial thing -- our big economy -- we 've really hardly started .
really , we 're doing this , basically . really , not very much .
i do n't want to depress you too much .
the problem is absolutely soluble , and even soluble in a way that 's reasonably cheap .
cheap meaning sort of the cost of the military , not the cost of medical care .
cheap meaning a few percent of gdp .
no , this is really important to have this sense of scale .
so the problem is soluble , and the way we should go about solving it is , say , dealing with electricity production , which causes something like 43 - or - so percent and rising of co 2 emissions .
and we could do that by perfectly sensible things like conservation , and wind power , nuclear power and coal to co 2 capture , which are all things that are ready for giant scale deployment , and work .
all we lack is the action to actually spend the money to put those into place .
instead , we spend our time talking .
but nevertheless , that 's not what i 'm going to talk to you about tonight .
what i 'm going to talk to you about tonight is stuff we might do if we did nothing .
and it 's this stuff in the middle here , which is what you do if you do n't stop the emissions quickly enough .
and you need to deal -- somehow break the link between human actions that change climate , and the climate change itself . and that 's particularly important because , of course , while we can adapt to climate change -- and it 's important to be honest here , there will be some benefits to climate change .
oh , yes , i think it 's bad . i 've spent my whole life working to stop it .
but one of the reasons it 's politically hard is there are winners and losers -- not all losers .
but , of course , the natural world , polar bears .
i spent time skiing across the sea ice for weeks at a time in the high arctic .
they will completely lose .
and there 's no adaption .
so this problem is absolutely soluble .
this geo - engineering idea , in it 's simplest form , is basically the following .
you could put signed particles , say sulfuric acid particles -- sulfates -- into the upper atmosphere , the stratosphere , where they 'd reflect away sunlight and cool the planet .
and i know for certain that that will work .
not that there are n't side effects , but i know for certain it will work .
and the reason is , it 's been done .
and it was done not by us , not by me , but by nature .
here 's mount pinatubo in the early '90s . that put a whole bunch of sulfur in the stratosphere with a sort of atomic bomb - like cloud .
the result of that was pretty dramatic .
after that , and some previous volcanoes we have , you see a quite dramatic cooling of the atmosphere .
so this lower bar is the upper atmosphere , the stratosphere , and it heats up after these volcanoes .
but you 'll notice that in the upper bar , which is the lower atmosphere and the surface , it cools down because we shielded the atmosphere a little bit .
there 's no big mystery about it .
there 's lots of mystery in the details , and there 's some bad side effects , like it partially destroys the ozone layer -- and i 'll get to that in a minute .
but it clearly cools down .
and one other thing : it 's fast .
it 's really important to say . so much of the other things that we ought to do , like slowing emissions , are intrinsically slow , because it takes time to build all the hardware we need to reduce emissions .
and not only that , when you cut emissions , you do n't cut concentrations , because concentrations , the amount of co 2 in the air , is the sum of emissions over time .
so you ca n't step on the brakes very quickly .
but if you do this , it 's quick .
and there are times you might like to do something quick .
another thing you might wonder about is , does it work ?
can you shade some sunlight and effectively compensate for the added co 2 , and produce a climate sort of back to what it was originally ?
and the answer seems to be yes .
so here are the graphs you 've seen lots of times before .
that 's what the world looks like , under one particular climate model 's view , with twice the amount of co 2 in the air .
the lower graph is with twice the amount of co 2 and 1.8 percent less sunlight , and you 're back to the original climate .
and this graph from ken caldeira . it 's important to say came , because ken -- at a meeting that i believe marty hoffart was also at in the mid - '90s -- ken and i stood up at the back of the meeting and said , " geo - engineering wo n't work . "
and to the person who was promoting it said , " the atmosphere 's much more complicated . "
gave a bunch of physical reasons why it would n't do a very good compensation .
ken went and ran his models , and found that it did .
this topic is also old .
that report that landed on president johnson 's desk when i was two years old -- 1965 .
that report , in fact , which had all the modern climate science -- the only thing they talked about doing was geo - engineering .
it did n't even talk about cutting emissions , which is an incredible shift in our thinking about this problem .
i 'm not saying we should n't cut emissions .
we should , but it made exactly this point .
so , in a sense , there 's not much new .
the one new thing is this essay .
so i should say , i guess , that since the time of that original president johnson report , and the various reports of the u.s. national academy -- 1977 , 1982 , 1990 -- people always talked about this idea .
not as something that was foolproof , but as an idea to think about .
but when climate became , politically , a hot topic -- if i may make the pun -- in the last 15 years , this became so un - pc , we could n't talk about it .
it just sunk below the surface . we were n't allowed to speak about it .
but in the last year , paul crutzen published this essay saying roughly what 's all been said before : that maybe , given our very slow rate of progress in solving this problem and the uncertain impacts , we should think about things like this .
he said roughly what 's been said before .
the big deal was he happened to have won the nobel prize for ozone chemistry .
and so people took him seriously when he said we should think about this , even though there will be some ozone impacts .
and in fact , he had some ideas to make them go away .
there was all sorts of press coverage , all over the world , going right down to " dr. strangelove saves the earth , " from the economist .
and that got me thinking . i 've worked on this topic on and off , but not so much technically . and i was actually lying in bed thinking one night .
and i thought about this child 's toy -- hence , the title of my talk -- and i wondered if you could use the same physics that makes that thing spin ' round in the child 's radiometer , to levitate particles into the upper atmosphere and make them stay there .
one of the problems with sulfates is they fall out quickly .
the other problem is they 're right in the ozone layer , and i 'd prefer them above the ozone layer .
and it turns out , i woke up the next morning , and i started to calculate this .
it was very hard to calculate from first principles . i was stumped .
but then i found out that there were all sorts of papers already published that addressed this topic because it happens already in the natural atmosphere .
so it seems there are already fine particles that are levitated up to what we call the mesosphere , about 100 kilometers up , that already have this effect .
i 'll tell you very quickly how the effect works .
there are a lot of fun complexities that i 'd love to spend the whole evening on , but i wo n't .
but let 's say you have sunlight hitting some particle and it 's unevenly heated .
so the side facing the sun is warmer ; the side away , cooler .
gas molecules that bounce off the warm side bounce away with some extra velocity because it 's warm .
and so you see a net force away from the sun.
that 's called the photophoretic force .
there are a bunch of other versions of it that i and some collaborators have thought about how to exploit .
and of course , we may be wrong -- this has n't all been peer reviewed , we 're in the middle of thinking about it -- but so far , it seems good .
but it looks like we could achieve long atmospheric lifetimes -- much longer than before -- because they 're levitated .
we can move things out of the stratosphere into the mesosphere , in principle solving the ozone problem .
i 'm sure there will be other problems that arise .
finally , we could make the particles migrate to over the poles , so we could arrange the climate engineering so it really focused on the poles .
which would have minimal bad impacts in the middle of the planet , where we live , and do the maximum job of what we might need to do , which is cooling the poles in case of planetary emergency , if you like .
this is a new idea that 's crept up that may be , essentially , a cleverer idea than putting sulfates in .
whether this idea is right or some other idea is right , i think it 's almost certain we will eventually think of cleverer things to do than just putting sulfur in .
that if engineers and scientists really turned their minds to this , it 's amazing how we can affect the planet .
the one thing about this is it gives us extraordinary leverage .
this improved science and engineering will , whether we like it or not , give us more and more leverage to affect the planet , to control the planet , to give us weather and climate control -- not because we plan it , not because we want it , just because science delivers it to us bit by bit , with better knowledge of the way the system works and better engineering tools to effect it .
now , suppose that space aliens arrived .
maybe they 're going to land at the u.n. headquarters down the road here , or maybe they 'll pick a smarter spot -- but suppose they arrive and they give you a box .
and the box has two knobs .
one knob is the knob for controlling global temperature .
maybe another knob is a knob for controlling co 2 concentrations .
you might imagine that we would fight wars over that box .
because we have no way to agree about where to set the knobs .
we have no global governance .
and different people will have different places they want it set .
now , i do n't think that 's going to happen . it 's not very likely .
but we 're building that box .
the scientists and engineers of the world are building it piece by piece , in their labs .
even when they 're doing it for other reasons .
even when they 're thinking they 're just working on protecting the environment .
they have no interest in crazy ideas like engineering the whole planet .
they develop science that makes it easier and easier to do .
and so i guess my view on this is not that i want to do it -- i do not -- but that we should move this out of the shadows and talk about it seriously .
because sooner or later , we 'll be confronted with decisions about this , and it 's better if we think hard about it , even if we want to think hard about reasons why we should never do it .
i 'll give you two different ways to think about this problem that are the beginning of my thinking about how to think about it .
but what we need is not just a few oddballs like me thinking about this .
we need a broader debate .
a debate that involves musicians , scientists , philosophers , writers , who get engaged with this question about climate engineering and think seriously about what its implications are .
so here 's one way to think about it , which is that we just do this instead of cutting emissions because it 's cheaper .
i guess the thing i have n't said about this is , it is absurdly cheap .
it 's conceivable that , say , using the sulfates method or this method i 've come up with , you could create an ice age at a cost of .001 percent of gdp .
it 's very cheap . we have a lot of leverage .
it 's not a good idea , but it 's just important .
i 'll tell you how big the lever is : the lever is that big .
and that calculation is n't much in dispute .
you might argue about the sanity of it , but the leverage is real .
so because of this , we could deal with the problem simply by stopping reducing emissions , and just as the concentrations go up , we can increase the amount of geo - engineering .
i do n't think anybody takes that seriously .
because under this scenario , we walk further and further away from the current climate .
we have all sorts of other problems , like ocean acidification that come from co 2 in the atmosphere , anyway .
nobody but maybe one or two very odd folks really suggest this .
but here 's a case which is harder to reject .
let 's say that we do n't do geo - engineering , we do what we ought to do , which is get serious about cutting emissions .
but we do n't really know how quickly we have to cut them .
there 's a lot of uncertainty about exactly how much climate change is too much .
so let 's say that we work hard , and we actually do n't just tap the brakes , but we step hard on the brakes and really reduce emissions and eventually reduce concentrations .
and maybe someday -- like 2075 , october 23 -- we finally reach that glorious day where concentrations have peaked and are rolling down the other side .
and we have global celebrations , and we 've actually started to -- you know , we 've seen the worst of it .
but maybe on that day we also find that the greenland ice sheet is really melting unacceptably fast , fast enough to put meters of sea level on the oceans in the next 100 years , and remove some of the biggest cities from the map .
that 's an absolutely possible scenario .
we might decide at that point that even though geo - engineering was uncertain and morally unhappy , that it 's a lot better than not geo - engineering .
and that 's a very different way to look at the problem .
it 's using this as risk control , not instead of action .
it 's saying that you do some geo - engineering for a little while to take the worst of the heat off , not that you 'd use it as a substitute for action .
but there is a problem with that view .
and the problem is the following : knowledge that geo - engineering is possible makes the climate impacts look less fearsome , and that makes a weaker commitment to cutting emissions today .
this is what economists call a moral hazard .
and that 's one of the fundamental reasons that this problem is so hard to talk about , and , in general , i think it 's the underlying reason that it 's been politically unacceptable to talk about this .
but you do n't make good policy by hiding things in a drawer .
i 'll leave you with three questions , and then one final quote .
should we do serious research on this topic ?
should we have a national research program that looks at this ?
not just at how you would do it better , but also what all the risks and downsides of it are .
right now , you have a few enthusiasts talking about it , some in a positive side , some in a negative side -- but that 's a dangerous state to be in because there 's very little depth of knowledge on this topic .
a very small amount of money would get us some .
many of us -- maybe now me -- think we should do that .
but i have a lot of reservations .
my reservations are principally about the moral hazard problem , and i do n't really know how we can best avoid the moral hazard .
i think there is a serious problem : as you talk about this , people begin to think they do n't need to work so hard to cut emissions .
another thing is , maybe we need a treaty .
a treaty that decides who gets to do this .
right now we may think of a big , rich country like the u.s. doing this .
but it might well be that , in fact , if china wakes up in 2030 and realizes that the climate impacts are just unacceptable , they may not be very interested in our moral conversations about how to do this , and they may just decide they 'd really rather have a geo - engineered world than a non - geo - engineered world .
and we 'll have no international mechanism to figure out who makes the decision .
so here 's one last thought , which was said much , much better 25 years ago in the u.s. national academy report than i can say today .
and i think it really summarizes where we are here .
that the co 2 problem , the climate problem that we 've heard about , is driving lots of things -- innovations in the energy technologies that will reduce emissions -- but also , i think , inevitably , it will drive us towards thinking about climate and weather control , whether we like it or not .
and it 's time to begin thinking about it , even if the reason we 're thinking about it is to construct arguments for why we should n't do it .
thank you very much .
