i	thought	if	i	 skip 	 ped 	 	it	might	help	my	 nerve 	 s 	 	,	but	i	'm	 actual 	 ly 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	 paradox 	 ical 	 	 re 	 action 	 	to	that	,	so	that	was	a	bad	idea	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	i	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 de 	 light 	 ed 	 	to	 receiv 	 e 	 	the	 invit 	 ation 	 	to	present	to	you	some	of	my	music	and	some	of	my	work	 a 	 s 	 	a	 compose 	 r 	 	,	 pre 	 sum 	 ably 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 appeal 	 s 	 	to	my	well	-	known	and	abundant	 nar 	 cis 	 s 	 ism 	 	.
and	i	'm	not	 kid 	 d 	 ing 	 	,	i	just	think	we	should	just	say	that	and	move	forward	.
so	,	but	the	thing	is	,	a	dilemma	 quick 	 ly 	 	 a 	 rose 	 	,	and	that	is	that	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 bor 	 ed 	 	with	music	,	and	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 bor 	 ed 	 	with	the	role	of	the	 compose 	 r 	 	,	and	so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	put	that	idea	,	 bore 	 dom 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	focus	of	my	 present 	 ation 	 	to	you	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	i	'm	going	to	share	my	music	with	you	,	but	i	hope	that	i	'm	going	to	do	so	in	a	way	that	 tell 	 s 	 	a	story	,	 tell 	 s 	 	a	story	about	how	i	used	 bore 	 dom 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	catalyst	for	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	and	 invent 	 ion 	 	,	and	how	 bore 	 dom 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 force 	 d 	 	me	to	change	the	fundamental	question	that	i	was	 ask 	 ing 	 	in	my	discipline	,	and	how	 bore 	 dom 	 	 al 	 so 	 	,	in	a	sense	,	 push 	 ed 	 	me	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	taking	on	 role 	 s 	 	beyond	the	sort	of	most	 tradition 	 al 	 	,	narrow	definition	of	a	 compose 	 r 	 	.
what	i	'd	like	to	do	 to 	 day 	 	is	to	start	with	an	excerpt	of	a	piece	of	music	at	the	piano	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	i	wrote	that	.
no	,	it	's	not	--	oh	,	why	thank	you	.
no	,	no	,	i	did	n't	write	that	.
in	fact	,	that	was	a	piece	by	beethoven	,	and	so	i	was	not	 function 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 compose 	 r 	 	.
just	now	i	was	 function 	 ing 	 	in	the	role	of	the	interpreter	,	and	there	i	am	,	interpreter	.
so	,	an	interpreter	of	what	?	of	a	piece	of	music	,	right	?
but	we	can	ask	the	question	,	``	but	is	it	music	?	``	and	i	say	 th 	 is 	 	 rhetoric 	 ally 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	course	by	just	about	any	standard	we	would	have	to	concede	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	of	course	,	a	piece	of	music	,	but	i	put	 th 	 is 	 	here	now	 be 	 cause 	 	,	just	to	set	it	in	your	 brain 	 s 	 	for	the	moment	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	going	to	return	to	 th 	 is 	 	question	.
it	's	going	to	be	a	kind	of	a	 refr 	 ain 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	go	through	the	 present 	 ation 	 	.
so	here	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	piece	of	music	by	beethoven	,	and	my	problem	with	it	is	,	it	's	 bor 	 ing 	 	.
i	mean	,	you	--	i	'm	just	like	,	a	hush	,	huh	--	it	's	like	--	it	's	beethoven	,	how	can	you	say	that	?
no	,	well	,	i	do	n't	know	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	familiar	to	me	.
i	had	to	practice	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	kid	,	and	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	sick	of	it	.	so	--	i	would	,	so	what	i	might	like	to	try	to	do	is	to	change	it	,	to	transform	it	in	some	ways	,	to	 personal 	 ize 	 	it	,	so	i	might	take	the	 open 	 ing 	 	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	idea	--	and	then	i	might	 substitut 	 e 	 	--	and	then	i	might	 improv 	 ise 	 	on	that	 melo 	 dy 	 	that	 go 	 es 	 	forward	from	there	--	so	that	might	be	the	kind	of	thing	--	why	thank	you	.
that	would	be	the	kind	of	thing	that	i	would	do	,	and	it	's	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	better	than	the	beethoven	.
in	fact	,	i	think	it	's	not	better	than	it	.	the	thing	is	--	--
it	's	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	me	.	it	's	less	 bor 	 ing 	 	for	me	.
i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 lean 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	me	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	have	to	think	about	what	 decision 	 s 	 	i	'm	going	to	make	on	the	fly	 a 	 s 	 	that	beethoven	text	is	running	in	time	through	my	head	and	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	what	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 transform 	 ations 	 	i	'm	going	to	make	to	it	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 engag 	 ing 	 	enterprise	for	me	,	and	i	've	 re 	 ally 	 	 lean 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	that	first	person	 pro 	 no 	 un 	 	thing	there	,	and	now	my	face	 appear 	 s 	 	twice	,	so	i	think	we	can	agree	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	solipsistic	enterprise	.
but	it	's	an	 engag 	 ing 	 	one	,	and	it	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	me	for	a	while	,	but	then	i	get	 bor 	 ed 	 	with	it	,	and	by	it	,	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	mean	,	the	piano	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 th 	 is 	 	familiar	instrument	,	it	's	timbral	range	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	 compress 	 ed 	 	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	when	you	play	on	the	 key 	 board 	 	,	and	if	you	're	not	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	it	after	you	've	lit	it	on	fire	or	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	,	you	know	.
it	 get 	 s 	 	a	little	bit	 bor 	 ing 	 	,	and	so	 pre 	 tty 	 	soon	i	go	through	other	 instrument 	 s 	 	,	they	 be 	 come 	 	familiar	,	and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	i	find	 my 	 self 	 	 design 	 ing 	 	and	 construct 	 ing 	 	my	own	instrument	,	and	i	 br 	 ought 	 	one	with	me	 to 	 day 	 	,	and	i	thought	i	would	play	a	little	bit	on	it	for	you	so	you	can	hear	what	it	 sound 	 s 	 	like	.
you	got	ta	have	doorstops	,	that	's	 import 	 ant 	 	.
i	've	got	 comb 	 s 	 	.	they	're	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 comb 	 s 	 	that	i	own	.
they	're	all	 mount 	 ed 	 	on	my	 instrument 	 s 	 	.
i	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.	i	can	play	with	a	 viol 	 in 	 	bow	.	i	do	n't	have	to	use	the	 chop 	 stick 	 s 	 	.
so	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	sound	.
and	with	a	bank	of	live	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	,	i	can	change	the	 sound 	 s 	 	 radical 	 ly 	 	.
like	that	,	and	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	so	forth	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 give 	 s 	 	you	a	little	bit	of	an	idea	of	the	sound	world	of	 th 	 is 	 	instrument	,	which	i	think	is	 quit 	 e 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	and	it	 put 	 s 	 	me	in	the	role	of	the	inventor	,	and	the	nice	thing	about	--	 th 	 is 	 	instrument	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	mouseketeer	...
and	the	cool	thing	about	it	is	i	'm	the	world	's	 great 	 est 	 	mouseketeer	player	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
so	in	that	regard	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	privileges	of	 be 	 ing 	 	,	and	here	's	 an 	 other 	 	role	,	the	inventor	,	and	by	the	way	,	when	i	told	you	that	i	'm	the	world	's	 great 	 est 	 	,	if	you	're	 keep 	 ing 	 	score	,	we	've	had	 nar 	 cis 	 s 	 ism 	 	and	 so 	 lips 	 ism 	 	and	now	a	 health 	 y 	 	dose	of	egocentricism	.
i	know	some	of	you	are	just	,	you	know	,	 bing 	 o 	 	!	or	,	i	do	n't	know	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 enjoy 	 able 	 	role	.
i	should	concede	 al 	 so 	 	that	i	'm	the	world	's	worst	mouseketeer	player	,	and	it	was	 th 	 is 	 	 distinct 	 ion 	 	that	i	was	most	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	when	i	was	on	that	prior	side	of	the	 ten 	 ure 	 	divide	.
i	'm	glad	i	'm	past	that	.	we	're	not	going	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	that	.
i	'm	 cry 	 ing 	 	on	the	 in 	 side 	 	.	there	are	still	 scar 	 s 	 	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	but	i	guess	my	point	is	that	all	of	these	 enterprise 	 s 	 	are	 engag 	 ing 	 	to	me	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 multi 	 plicit 	 y 	 	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	i	've	 present 	 ed 	 	them	to	you	 to 	 day 	 	,	they	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 so 	 lit 	 ary 	 	 enterprise 	 s 	 	,	and	so	 pre 	 tty 	 	soon	i	want	to	 commun 	 e 	 	with	other	people	,	and	so	i	'm	 de 	 light 	 ed 	 	that	in	fact	i	get	to	compose	 work 	 s 	 	for	them	.
i	get	to	write	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	for	soloists	and	i	get	to	work	with	one	person	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	full	 orchestra 	 s 	 	,	and	i	work	with	a	lot	of	people	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	,	the	role	 creative 	 ly 	 	for	which	i	'm	 prob 	 ably 	 	best	known	 professional 	 ly 	 	.
now	,	some	of	my	 score 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 compose 	 r 	 	look	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	 other 	 s 	 	look	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	some	look	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	i	make	all	of	these	by	hand	,	and	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 ted 	 ious 	 	.
it	 take 	 s 	 	a	long	,	long	time	to	make	these	 score 	 s 	 	,	and	right	now	i	'm	 work 	 ing 	 	on	a	piece	that	's	180	 page 	 s 	 	in	length	,	and	it	's	just	a	big	chunk	of	my	life	,	and	i	'm	just	 pull 	 ing 	 	out	hair	.
i	have	a	lot	of	it	,	and	that	's	a	good	thing	i	suppose	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 get 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 bor 	 ing 	 	and	 re 	 ally 	 	 tire 	 some 	 	for	me	,	so	after	a	while	the	process	of	notating	is	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 bor 	 ing 	 	,	but	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	want	the	 not 	 ation 	 	to	be	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	and	so	that	's	 push 	 ed 	 	me	to	do	other	 project 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	excerpt	from	a	score	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	metaphysics	of	 not 	 ation 	 	.	``
the	full	score	is	72	feet	wide	.
it	's	a	bunch	of	crazy	pictographic	 not 	 ation 	 	.
let	's	zoom	in	on	one	section	of	it	right	here	.	you	can	see	it	's	 ra 	 ther 	 	 detail 	 ed 	 	.	i	do	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	with	 draft 	 ing 	 	 template 	 s 	 	,	with	straight	 edge 	 s 	 	,	with	french	 curv 	 es 	 	,	and	by	 free 	 hand 	 	,	and	the	72	feet	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	split	 in 	 to 	 	12	six	-	foot	-	wide	 pan 	 el 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 install 	 ed 	 	around	the	cantor	 art 	 s 	 	center	museum	lobby	 balc 	 ony 	 	,	and	it	 appear 	 ed 	 	for	one	year	in	the	museum	,	and	 dur 	 ing 	 	that	year	,	it	was	 experience 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	visual	art	most	of	the	week	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	in	these	 picture 	 s 	 	,	on	fridays	,	from	noon	til	one	,	and	 on 	 ly 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	that	time	,	 vari 	 ous 	 	 perform 	 ers 	 	came	and	 interpret 	 ed 	 	these	strange	and	 un 	 defined 	 	pictographic	glyphs	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	experience	for	me	.
it	was	 grat 	 ifying 	 	 musical 	 ly 	 	,	but	i	think	the	more	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	is	it	was	 excit 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	got	to	take	on	 an 	 other 	 	role	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 give 	 n 	 	that	it	 appear 	 ed 	 	in	a	museum	,	and	that	is	 a 	 s 	 	visual	artist	.
we	're	going	to	fill	up	the	whole	thing	,	do	n't	worry	.
i	am	multitudes	.
would	say	,	like	,	``	oh	,	you	're	 be 	 ing 	 	a	dilettante	,	``	and	 may 	 be 	 	that	's	true	.	i	can	understand	how	,	i	mean	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	do	n't	have	a	 ped 	 igree 	 	in	visual	art	and	i	do	n't	have	any	training	,	but	it	's	just	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	 a 	 s 	 	an	 extens 	 ion 	 	of	my	 com 	 position 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	 extens 	 ion 	 	of	a	kind	of	creative	impulse	.
i	can	understand	the	question	,	 th 	 ough 	 	.	``	but	is	it	music	?	``	i	mean	,	there	's	not	any	 tradition 	 al 	 	 not 	 ation 	 	.
i	can	 al 	 so 	 	understand	that	sort	of	 im 	 plicit 	 	 critic 	 ism 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	piece	,	``	s	-	tog	,	``	which	i	made	when	i	was	living	in	copenhagen	.
i	took	the	copenhagen	 sub 	 way 	 	map	and	i	 re 	 named 	 	all	the	 station 	 s 	 	to	abstract	musical	provocations	,	and	the	 player 	 s 	 	,	who	are	 synchron 	 ized 	 	with	 stop 	 watch 	 es 	 	,	follow	the	 time 	 table 	 s 	 	,	which	are	 list 	 ed 	 	in	 minute 	 s 	 	past	the	hour	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	case	of	 actual 	 ly 	 	 adapt 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	,	or	 may 	 be 	 	 steal 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	,	and	then	 turn 	 ing 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	musical	 not 	 ation 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	 adapt 	 ation 	 	would	be	 th 	 is 	 	piece	.
i	took	the	idea	of	the	 wrist 	 watch 	 	,	and	i	 turn 	 ed 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	musical	score	.
i	made	my	own	 face 	 s 	 	,	and	had	a	company	 fabric 	 ate 	 	them	,	and	the	 player 	 s 	 	follow	these	 score 	 s 	 	.
they	follow	the	second	 hand 	 s 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	they	pass	over	the	 vari 	 ous 	 	 symbol 	 s 	 	,	the	 player 	 s 	 	respond	 musical 	 ly 	 	.
here	's	 an 	 other 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	from	 an 	 other 	 	piece	,	and	then	 it 	 s 	 	 real 	 ization 	 	.
so	in	these	two	 cap 	 a 	 cities 	 	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 scavenge 	 r 	 	,	in	the	sense	of	taking	,	like	,	the	 sub 	 way 	 	map	,	right	,	or	 th 	 ie 	 f 	 	 may 	 be 	 	,	and	i	've	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 design 	 er 	 	,	in	the	case	of	making	the	 wrist 	 watch 	 es 	 	.
and	once	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	for	me	,	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	role	that	i	like	to	take	on	is	that	of	the	performance	artist	.
some	of	my	 piece 	 s 	 	have	these	kind	of	weird	theatric	 element 	 s 	 	,	and	i	often	perform	them	.	i	want	to	show	you	a	clip	from	a	piece	 call 	 ed 	 	``	echolalia	.	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 perform 	 ed 	 	by	brian	mcwhorter	,	who	is	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 perform 	 er 	 	.
let	's	watch	a	little	bit	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	 pleas 	 e 	 	notice	the	 instrument 	 ation 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	i	hear	you	 we 	 re 	 	 laugh 	 ing 	 	 nervous 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	you	too	could	hear	that	the	drill	was	a	little	bit	sharp	,	the	 in 	 ton 	 ation 	 	was	a	little	 question 	 able 	 	.
let	's	watch	just	 an 	 other 	 	clip	.
you	can	see	the	mayhem	 continu 	 es 	 	,	and	there	's	,	you	know	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	no	clarinets	and	 trump 	 et 	 s 	 	and	 flut 	 es 	 	and	 viol 	 in 	 s 	 	.	here	's	a	piece	that	 ha 	 s 	 	an	even	more	 un 	 usual 	 	,	more	peculiar	 instrument 	 ation 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	``	tlön	,	``	for	three	 conductor 	 s 	 	and	no	 player 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	based	on	the	experience	of	 actual 	 ly 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	two	people	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	 virul 	 ent 	 	argument	in	sign	language	,	which	 produce 	 d 	 	no	 decibel 	 s 	 	to	speak	of	,	but	affectively	,	 psycho 	 logically 	 	,	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	loud	experience	.
so	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	i	get	it	,	with	,	like	,	the	weird	 appli 	 ance 	 s 	 	and	then	the	total	 ab 	 s 	 ence 	 	of	 convention 	 al 	 	 instrument 	 s 	 	and	 th 	 is 	 	glut	of	 conductor 	 s 	 	,	people	might	,	you	know	,	wonder	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	``	is	 th 	 is 	 	music	?	``	but	let	's	move	on	to	a	piece	where	 clear 	 ly 	 	i	'm	 behav 	 ing 	 	 my 	 self 	 	,	and	that	is	my	``	 concert 	 o 	 	for	orchestra	.	``
you	're	going	to	notice	a	lot	of	 convention 	 al 	 	 instrument 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	clip	.
 th 	 is 	 	,	in	fact	,	is	not	the	title	of	 th 	 is 	 	piece	.	i	was	a	bit	 mis 	 ch 	 iev 	 ous 	 	.	in	fact	,	to	make	it	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	i	put	a	space	right	in	here	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	actual	title	of	the	piece	.
let	's	 continu 	 e 	 	with	that	same	excerpt	.
it	's	better	with	a	florist	,	right	?
or	at	 l 	 east 	 	it	's	less	 bor 	 ing 	 	.	let	's	watch	a	couple	more	 clip 	 s 	 	.
so	with	all	these	theatric	 element 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 push 	 es 	 	me	in	 an 	 other 	 	role	,	and	that	would	be	,	possibly	,	the	dramaturge	.
i	was	 play 	 ing 	 	nice	.	i	had	to	write	the	orchestra	bits	,	right	?
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?	but	then	there	was	 th 	 is 	 	other	stuff	,	right	?
there	was	the	florist	,	and	i	can	understand	that	,	once	 aga 	 in 	 	,	we	're	 put 	 ting 	 	pressure	on	the	 onto 	 logy 	 	of	music	 a 	 s 	 	we	know	it	 convention 	 ally 	 	,	but	let	's	look	at	one	last	piece	 to 	 day 	 	i	'm	going	to	share	with	you	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	be	a	piece	 call 	 ed 	 	``	aphasia	,	``	and	it	's	for	hand	 gest 	 ures 	 	 synchron 	 ized 	 	to	sound	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 invit 	 es 	 	yet	 an 	 other 	 	role	,	and	final	one	i	'll	share	with	you	,	which	is	that	of	the	 choreograph 	 er 	 	.
and	the	score	for	the	piece	 look 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	it	 instruct 	 s 	 	me	,	the	 perform 	 er 	 	,	to	make	 vari 	 ous 	 	hand	 gest 	 ures 	 	at	 ver 	 y 	 	specific	 time 	 s 	 	 synchron 	 ized 	 	with	an	audio	tape	,	and	that	audio	tape	is	made	up	 exclusive 	 ly 	 	of	vocal	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
i	 record 	 ed 	 	an	awesome	 s 	 ing 	 er 	 	,	and	i	took	the	sound	of	his	voice	in	my	computer	,	and	i	 warp 	 ed 	 	it	in	 count 	 less 	 	ways	to	come	up	with	the	 sound 	 track 	 	that	you	're	about	to	hear	.
and	i	'll	perform	just	an	excerpt	of	``	aphasia	``	for	you	here	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
so	that	 give 	 s 	 	you	a	little	taste	of	that	piece	.
 yea 	 h 	 	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	that	's	kind	of	weird	stuff	.
is	it	music	?	here	's	how	i	want	to	conclude	.
i	've	 decide 	 d 	 	,	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	wrong	question	,	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	the	 import 	 ant 	 	question	.
the	 import 	 ant 	 	question	is	,	``	is	it	 interest 	 ing 	 	?	``	and	i	follow	 th 	 is 	 	question	,	not	 worry 	 ing 	 	about	``	is	it	music	?	``	not	 worry 	 ing 	 	about	the	definition	of	the	thing	that	i	'm	making	.
i	allow	my	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	to	push	me	in	 direction 	 s 	 	that	are	 simpl 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	me	,	and	i	do	n't	worry	about	the	likeness	of	the	result	to	some	 not 	 ion 	 	,	some	paradigm	,	of	what	music	 com 	 position 	 	is	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	,	and	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 urge 	 d 	 	me	,	in	a	sense	,	to	take	on	a	whole	bunch	of	different	 role 	 s 	 	,	and	so	what	i	want	you	to	think	about	is	,	to	what	 ex 	 tent 	 	might	you	change	the	fundamental	question	in	your	discipline	,	and	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	i	'm	going	to	put	one	extra	little	 foot 	 note 	 	in	here	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	like	,	i	 real 	 ized 	 	i	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	some	 psycho 	 logical 	 	 defect 	 s 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	,	and	we	 al 	 so 	 	,	 a 	 long 	 	the	way	,	had	a	fair	amount	of	 obsess 	 ive 	 	behavior	,	and	there	was	some	 delusion 	 al 	 	behavior	and	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	,	and	here	i	think	we	could	say	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	argument	for	self	-	 loath 	 ing 	 	and	a	kind	of	 schizo 	 phrenia 	 	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	in	the	popular	use	of	the	term	,	and	i	 re 	 ally 	 	mean	dissociative	 ident 	 ity 	 	 dis 	 order 	 	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	 de 	 spite 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 peril 	 s 	 	,	i	would	urge	you	to	think	about	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	that	you	might	take	on	 role 	 s 	 	in	your	own	work	,	 whet 	 her 	 	they	are	 neighbor 	 ing 	 	or	far	-	 f 	 lung 	 	from	your	professional	definition	.
and	with	that	,	i	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
