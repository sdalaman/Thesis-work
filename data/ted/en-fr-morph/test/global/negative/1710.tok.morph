so	i	'll	be	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	success	of	my	campus	,	the	university	of	maryland	,	baltimore	 count 	 y 	 	,	umbc	,	in	 educ 	 ating 	 	 student 	 s 	 	of	all	 type 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 art 	 s 	 	and	 human 	 ities 	 	and	the	science	and	 engineer 	 ing 	 	 area 	 s 	 	.	what	 make 	 s 	 	our	story	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	is	that	we	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	so	much	from	a	group	of	 student 	 s 	 	who	are	 typical 	 ly 	 	not	at	the	top	of	the	academic	 lad 	 der 	 	--	 student 	 s 	 	of	color	,	 student 	 s 	 	 under 	 represent 	 ed 	 	in	 select 	 ed 	 	 area 	 s 	 	.
and	what	 make 	 s 	 	the	story	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 un 	 ique 	 	is	that	we	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	how	to	help	african	-	american	 student 	 s 	 	,	latino	 student 	 s 	 	,	 student 	 s 	 	from	low	-	income	 back 	 ground 	 s 	 	,	to	 be 	 come 	 	some	of	the	best	in	the	world	in	science	and	 engineer 	 ing 	 	.
and	so	i	begin	with	a	story	about	my	 child 	 hood 	 	.
we	all	are	 product 	 s 	 	of	our	 child 	 hood 	 	 experience 	 s 	 	.
it	's	hard	for	me	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	50	 year 	 s 	 	since	i	had	the	experience	of	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 n 	 in 	 th 	 	grade	kid	in	birmingham	,	alabama	,	a	kid	who	 love 	 d 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	a	's	,	a	kid	who	 love 	 d 	 	math	,	who	 love 	 d 	 	to	read	,	a	kid	who	would	say	to	the	teacher	--	when	the	teacher	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	here	are	10	 problem 	 s 	 	,	``	to	the	class	,	 th 	 is 	 	little	fat	kid	would	say	,	``	give	us	10	more	.	``	and	the	whole	class	would	say	,	``	shut	up	,	freeman	.	``
and	there	was	a	 design 	 ated 	 	 kick 	 er 	 	every	day	.
and	so	i	was	 al 	 ways 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	question	:	``	well	how	could	we	get	more	 kid 	 s 	 	to	 re 	 ally 	 	love	to	learn	?	``	and	 amaz 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	one	week	in	church	,	when	i	 re 	 ally 	 	did	n't	want	to	be	there	and	i	was	in	the	back	of	the	room	 be 	 ing 	 	 placate 	 d 	 	by	 do 	 ing 	 	math	 problem 	 s 	 	,	i	heard	 th 	 is 	 	man	say	 th 	 is 	 	:	``	if	we	can	get	the	children	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 peace 	 ful 	 	 demonst 	 ration 	 	here	in	birmingham	,	we	can	show	america	that	even	children	know	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	right	and	wrong	and	that	children	 re 	 ally 	 	do	want	to	get	the	best	possible	education	.	``	and	i	 look 	 ed 	 	up	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	who	is	that	man	?	``	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	his	name	was	dr.	martin	luther	king	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	to	my	 parent 	 s 	 	,	``	i	've	got	to	go	.
i	want	to	go	.	i	want	to	be	a	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	.	``	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 absolute 	 ly 	 	not	.	``
and	we	had	a	rough	go	of	it	.
and	at	that	time	,	 quit 	 e 	 	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	you	 re 	 ally 	 	did	not	talk	back	to	your	 parent 	 s 	 	.
and	 some 	 how 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	,	you	 guy 	 s 	 	are	hypocrites	.
you	make	me	go	to	 th 	 is 	 	.	you	make	me	listen	.
the	man	 want 	 s 	 	me	to	go	,	and	now	you	say	no.	``	and	they	thought	about	it	all	night	.
and	they	came	 in 	 to 	 	my	room	the	next	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
they	had	not	slept	.
they	had	 be 	 en 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	 cry 	 ing 	 	and	 pray 	 ing 	 	and	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	will	we	let	our	12	-	year	-	old	 particip 	 ate 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	march	and	 prob 	 ably 	 	have	to	go	to	jail	?	``	and	they	 decide 	 d 	 	to	do	it	.
and	when	they	came	in	to	tell	me	,	i	was	at	first	 el 	 ated 	 	.
and	then	all	of	a	sudden	i	 beg 	 an 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	 dog 	 s 	 	and	the	fire	 hose 	 s 	 	,	and	i	got	 re 	 ally 	 	 scar 	 ed 	 	,	i	 re 	 ally 	 	did	.
and	one	of	the	 point 	 s 	 	i	make	to	people	all	the	time	is	that	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	when	people	do	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 courage 	 ous 	 	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	mean	that	they	're	that	 courage 	 ous 	 	.
it	 simpl 	 y 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	they	 believ 	 e 	 	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	do	it	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	a	better	education	.
i	did	not	want	to	have	to	have	hand	-	me	-	down	 book 	 s 	 	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	know	that	the	school	i	 attend 	 ed 	 	not	 on 	 ly 	 	had	good	 teacher 	 s 	 	,	but	the	 resource 	 s 	 	we	 need 	 ed 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	that	experience	,	in	the	middle	of	the	week	,	while	i	was	there	in	jail	,	dr.	king	came	and	 s 	 aid 	 	with	our	 parent 	 s 	 	,	``	what	you	children	do	 th 	 is 	 	day	will	have	an	impact	on	children	who	have	not	 be 	 en 	 	born	.	``	i	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 real 	 ized 	 	that	two	-	 third 	 s 	 	of	americans	 to 	 day 	 	had	not	 be 	 en 	 	born	at	the	time	of	1963	.
and	so	for	them	,	when	they	hear	about	the	children	's	crusade	in	birmingham	,	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	,	if	they	see	it	on	tv	,	it	's	like	our	looking	at	the	1863	``	lincoln	``	movie	:	it	's	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
and	the	real	question	is	,	what	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	did	we	learn	?
well	 amaz 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	for	me	was	 th 	 is 	 	:	that	children	can	be	 empower 	 ed 	 	to	take	 owner 	 ship 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	education	.
they	can	be	taught	to	be	passionate	about	 want 	 ing 	 	to	learn	and	to	love	the	idea	of	 ask 	 ing 	 	 question 	 s 	 	.
and	so	it	is	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	significant	that	the	university	i	now	lead	,	the	university	of	maryland	,	baltimore	 count 	 y 	 	,	umbc	,	was	 found 	 ed 	 	the	 ver 	 y 	 	year	i	went	to	jail	with	dr.	king	,	in	1963	.
and	what	made	that	 institution 	 al 	 	 found 	 ing 	 	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	is	that	maryland	is	the	south	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	know	,	and	,	 quit 	 e 	 	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	it	was	the	first	university	in	our	state	 found 	 ed 	 	at	a	time	when	 student 	 s 	 	of	all	 race 	 s 	 	could	go	there	.
and	so	we	had	black	and	white	 student 	 s 	 	and	 other 	 s 	 	who	 beg 	 an 	 	to	attend	.
and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	for	50	 year 	 s 	 	an	experiment	.
the	experiment	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	is	it	possible	to	have	 institution 	 s 	 	in	our	country	,	 un 	 ive 	 rs 	 ities 	 	,	where	people	from	all	 back 	 ground 	 s 	 	can	come	and	learn	and	learn	to	work	together	and	learn	to	 be 	 come 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	and	to	support	each	other	in	that	experience	?
now	what	is	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	about	that	experience	for	me	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	we	found	that	we	could	do	a	lot	in	the	 art 	 s 	 	and	 human 	 ities 	 	and	social	 science 	 s 	 	.
and	so	we	 beg 	 an 	 	to	work	on	that	,	for	 year 	 s 	 	in	the	'60s	.
and	we	 produce 	 d 	 	a	number	of	people	in	law	,	all	the	way	to	the	 human 	 ities 	 	.
we	 produce 	 d 	 	great	 artist 	 s 	 	.	beckett	is	our	muse	.
a	lot	of	our	 student 	 s 	 	get	 in 	 to 	 	theater	.
it	's	great	work	.
the	problem	that	we	 face 	 d 	 	was	the	same	problem	america	 continu 	 es 	 	to	face	--	that	 student 	 s 	 	in	the	 science 	 s 	 	and	 engineer 	 ing 	 	,	black	 student 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	not	 succeed 	 ing 	 	.
but	when	i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	data	,	what	i	found	was	that	,	 quit 	 e 	 	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	 student 	 s 	 	in	general	,	large	 number 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	not	making	it	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	that	,	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	that	would	help	,	first	of	all	,	the	group	at	the	bottom	,	african	-	american	 student 	 s 	 	,	and	then	hispanic	 student 	 s 	 	.
and	robert	and	jane	meyerhoff	,	 philanthro 	 pist 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	'd	like	to	help	.	``	robert	meyerhoff	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	why	is	it	that	 every 	 thing 	 	i	see	on	tv	about	black	 boy 	 s 	 	,	if	it	's	not	about	 basket 	 ball 	 	,	is	not	positive	?
i	'd	like	to	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	,	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	positive	.	``	we	married	 t 	 hose 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	,	and	we	 create 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	meyerhoff	 scholar 	 s 	 	program	.
and	what	is	significant	about	the	program	is	that	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	a	number	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	the	question	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	how	is	it	that	now	we	lead	the	country	in	producing	african	-	americans	who	go	on	to	complete	ph.d.	's	in	science	and	 engineer 	 ing 	 	and	m.d	.	/	ph.d.	's	?
that	's	a	big	deal	.	give	me	a	hand	for	that	.	that	's	a	big	deal	.
that	's	a	big	deal	.	it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	.
you	see	,	most	people	do	n't	 real 	 ize 	 	that	it	's	not	just	 minor 	 ities 	 	who	do	n't	do	well	in	science	and	 engineer 	 ing 	 	.
 quit 	 e 	 	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	you	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	americans	.
if	you	do	n't	know	it	,	while	20	percent	of	 black 	 s 	 	and	hispanics	who	begin	with	a	major	in	science	and	 engineer 	 ing 	 	will	 actual 	 ly 	 	graduate	in	science	and	 engineer 	 ing 	 	,	 on 	 ly 	 	32	percent	of	 white 	 s 	 	who	begin	with	 major 	 s 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 area 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	succeed	and	graduate	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 area 	 s 	 	,	and	 on 	 ly 	 	42	percent	of	asian	-	americans	.
and	so	,	the	real	question	is	,	what	is	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	?
well	a	part	of	it	,	of	course	,	is	k	-	12	.
we	need	to	 strength 	 en 	 	k	-	12	.
but	the	other	part	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	with	the	culture	of	science	and	 engineer 	 ing 	 	on	our	 campus 	 es 	 	.
 whet 	 her 	 	you	know	it	or	not	,	large	 number 	 s 	 	of	 student 	 s 	 	with	high	 s 	 at 	 	's	and	large	 number 	 s 	 	of	a.p	.	 credit 	 s 	 	who	go	to	the	most	 pre 	 stig 	 ious 	 	 un 	 ive 	 rs 	 ities 	 	in	our	country	begin	in	pre	-	med	or	pre	-	 engineer 	 ing 	 	and	 engineer 	 ing 	 	,	and	they	end	up	changing	 the 	 ir 	 	 major 	 s 	 	.
and	the	number	one	reason	,	we	find	,	 quit 	 e 	 	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	is	they	did	not	do	well	in	first	year	science	 course 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	we	call	first	year	science	and	 engineer 	 ing 	 	,	 typical 	 ly 	 	around	america	,	weed	-	out	 course 	 s 	 	or	 bar 	 rier 	 	 course 	 s 	 	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	in	 th 	 is 	 	audience	know	 some 	 body 	 	who	 start 	 ed 	 	off	in	pre	-	med	or	 engineer 	 ing 	 	and	 change 	 d 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	major	 with 	 in 	 	a	year	or	two	?
it	's	an	american	 challeng 	 e 	 	.	half	of	you	in	the	room	.
i	know	.	i	know	.	i	know	.
and	what	is	 interest 	 ing 	 	about	that	is	that	so	 man 	 y 	 	 student 	 s 	 	are	smart	and	can	do	it	.
we	need	to	find	ways	of	making	it	happen	.
so	what	are	the	four	 thing 	 s 	 	we	did	to	help	 minor 	 ity 	 	 student 	 s 	 	that	now	are	 help 	 ing 	 	 student 	 s 	 	in	general	?
number	one	:	high	 expect 	 ations 	 	.
it	 take 	 s 	 	an	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	the	academic	 pre 	 par 	 ation 	 	of	 student 	 s 	 	--	 the 	 ir 	 	 grade 	 s 	 	,	the	rigor	of	the	course	work	,	 the 	 ir 	 	test	-	taking	 skill 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	attitude	,	the	fire	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 bel 	 ly 	 	,	the	 pass 	 ion 	 	for	the	work	,	to	make	it	.
and	so	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	to	help	 student 	 s 	 	 prep 	 are 	 	to	be	in	that	position	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
but	 equal 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	it	 take 	 s 	 	an	 understand 	 ing 	 	that	it	's	hard	work	that	 make 	 s 	 	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
i	do	n't	care	how	smart	you	are	or	how	smart	you	think	you	are	.
smart	 simpl 	 y 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	you	're	ready	to	learn	.
you	're	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	 learn 	 ing 	 	and	you	want	to	ask	good	 question 	 s 	 	.
i.	i.	rabi	,	a	 no 	 bel 	 	laureate	,	 s 	 aid 	 	that	when	he	was	growing	up	in	new	york	,	all	of	his	 friend 	 s 	 	'	 parent 	 s 	 	would	ask	them	``	what	did	you	learn	in	school	?	``	at	the	end	of	a	day	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	in	contrast	,	his	jewish	mother	would	say	,	``	izzy	,	did	you	ask	a	good	question	 to 	 day 	 	?	``	and	so	high	 expect 	 ations 	 	have	to	do	with	curiosity	and	 encourag 	 ing 	 	young	people	to	be	 cur 	 ious 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	 t 	 hose 	 	high	 expect 	 ations 	 	,	we	 beg 	 an 	 	to	find	 student 	 s 	 	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	work	with	to	see	what	could	we	do	to	help	them	,	not	 simpl 	 y 	 	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	in	science	and	 engineer 	 ing 	 	,	but	to	 be 	 come 	 	the	 ver 	 y 	 	best	,	to	excel	.
 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	:	one	young	man	who	 earn 	 ed 	 	a	c	in	the	first	course	and	 want 	 ed 	 	to	go	on	to	med	school	,	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	need	to	have	you	retake	the	course	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	need	a	strong	 found 	 ation 	 	if	you	're	going	to	move	to	the	next	level	.	``	every	 found 	 ation 	 	 make 	 s 	 	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	the	next	level	.
he	retook	the	course	.
that	young	man	went	on	to	graduate	from	umbc	,	to	 be 	 come 	 	the	first	black	to	get	the	m.d	.	/	ph.d.	from	the	university	of	pennsylvania	.
he	now	 work 	 s 	 	at	harvard	.
nice	story	.	give	him	a	hand	for	that	too	.
 second 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	not	about	test	 score 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	.
test	 score 	 s 	 	are	 import 	 ant 	 	,	but	they	're	not	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	.
one	young	woman	had	great	 grade 	 s 	 	,	but	test	 score 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	not	 a 	 s 	 	high	.
but	she	had	a	factor	that	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
she	never	 mis 	 s 	 ed 	 	a	day	of	school	,	k	-	12	.
there	was	fire	in	that	 bel 	 ly 	 	.
that	young	woman	went	on	,	and	she	is	 to 	 day 	 	with	an	m.d	.	/	ph.d.	from	hopkins	.
she	's	on	the	 facul 	 ty 	 	,	 ten 	 ure 	 	track	in	 psych 	 iatry 	 	,	ph.d.	in	 neuro 	 science 	 	.
she	and	her	 advise 	 r 	 	have	a	patent	on	a	second	use	of	viagra	for	diabetes	 patient 	 s 	 	.
big	hand	for	her	.	big	hand	for	her	.
and	so	high	 expect 	 ations 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
 second 	 ly 	 	,	the	idea	of	building	community	among	the	 student 	 s 	 	.
you	all	know	that	so	often	in	science	and	 engineer 	 ing 	 	we	tend	to	think	 cut 	 throat 	 	.
 student 	 s 	 	are	not	taught	to	work	in	 group 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	what	we	work	to	do	with	that	group	to	get	them	to	understand	each	other	,	to	build	trust	among	them	,	to	support	each	other	,	to	learn	how	to	ask	good	 question 	 s 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	to	learn	how	to	explain	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	with	 clar 	 ity 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	know	,	it	's	one	thing	to	earn	an	a	 your 	 self 	 	,	it	's	 an 	 other 	 	thing	to	help	 some 	 one 	 	else	do	well	.
and	so	to	feel	that	sense	of	 respons 	 ibility 	 	 make 	 s 	 	all	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	the	world	.
so	building	community	among	 t 	 hose 	 	 student 	 s 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
third	,	the	idea	of	,	it	 take 	 s 	 	 research 	 ers 	 	to	produce	 research 	 ers 	 	.
 whet 	 her 	 	you	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 artist 	 s 	 	producing	 artist 	 s 	 	or	you	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	people	 get 	 ting 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	social	 science 	 s 	 	,	 what 	 ever 	 	the	discipline	--	and	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	in	science	and	 engineer 	 ing 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	in	art	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	--	you	need	 scientist 	 s 	 	to	pull	the	 student 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	work	.
and	so	our	 student 	 s 	 	are	 work 	 ing 	 	in	 lab 	 s 	 	 regular 	 ly 	 	.
and	one	great	 ex 	 ample 	 	that	you	'll	appreciate	:	 dur 	 ing 	 	a	snowstorm	in	baltimore	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,
the	guy	on	our	campus	with	 th 	 is 	 	howard	hughes	medical	institute	grant	 liter 	 ally 	 	came	back	to	work	in	his	lab	after	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 day 	 s 	 	,	and	all	these	 student 	 s 	 	had	 re 	 fused 	 	to	 leav 	 e 	 	the	lab	.
they	had	food	they	had	 pack 	 ed 	 	out	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	in	the	lab	 work 	 ing 	 	,	and	they	saw	the	work	,	not	 a 	 s 	 	 school 	 work 	 	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
they	 k 	 new 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 aid 	 s 	 	research	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	looking	at	 th 	 is 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	protein	design	.
and	what	was	 interest 	 ing 	 	was	each	one	of	them	focused	on	that	work	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	get	any	better	than	that	.	``	and	then	 final 	 ly 	 	,	if	you	've	got	the	community	and	you	've	got	the	high	 expect 	 ations 	 	and	you	've	got	 research 	 ers 	 	producing	 research 	 ers 	 	,	you	have	to	have	people	who	are	 will 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 facul 	 ty 	 	to	get	 involve 	 d 	 	with	 t 	 hose 	 	 student 	 s 	 	,	even	in	the	 class 	 room 	 	.
i	'll	never	forget	a	 facul 	 ty 	 	member	 call 	 ing 	 	the	staff	and	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	i	've	got	 th 	 is 	 	young	man	in	class	,	a	young	black	guy	,
and	he	 seem 	 s 	 	like	he	's	just	not	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	the	work	.
he	's	not	taking	 note 	 s 	 	.	we	need	to	talk	to	him	.	``	what	was	significant	was	that	the	 facul 	 ty 	 	member	was	 observ 	 ing 	 	every	student	to	understand	who	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	and	who	was	not	and	was	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	let	me	see	how	i	can	work	with	them	.
let	me	get	the	staff	to	help	me	out	.	``	it	was	that	 connect 	 ing 	 	.
that	young	man	 to 	 day 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 facul 	 ty 	 	member	m.d	.	/	ph.d.	in	neuroengineering	at	 du 	 ke 	 	.	give	him	a	big	hand	for	that	.
and	so	the	 sign 	 ific 	 ance 	 	is	that	we	have	now	 develop 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	model	that	is	 help 	 ing 	 	us	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 final 	 ly 	 	with	 evalu 	 ation 	 	,	 assess 	 ing 	 	what	 work 	 s 	 	.
and	what	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	was	that	we	 need 	 ed 	 	to	think	about	 re 	 design 	 ing 	 	 course 	 s 	 	.
and	so	we	 re 	 designed 	 	 chemist 	 ry 	 	,	we	 re 	 designed 	 	physics	.
but	now	we	are	looking	at	 re 	 design 	 ing 	 	the	 human 	 ities 	 	and	social	 science 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	so	 man 	 y 	 	 student 	 s 	 	are	 bor 	 ed 	 	in	class	.
do	you	know	that	?
 man 	 y 	 	 student 	 s 	 	,	k	-	12	and	in	 un 	 ive 	 rs 	 ities 	 	,	do	n't	want	to	just	 s 	 it 	 	there	and	listen	to	 some 	 body 	 	talk	.
they	need	to	be	 engag 	 ed 	 	.
and	so	we	have	 d 	 one 	 	--	if	you	look	at	our	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	at	the	 chemist 	 ry 	 	 discover 	 y 	 	center	,	you	'll	see	people	coming	from	all	over	the	country	to	look	at	how	we	are	 re 	 design 	 ing 	 	 course 	 s 	 	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	an	 emphas 	 is 	 	on	 collabor 	 ation 	 	,	use	of	technology	,	using	 problem 	 s 	 	out	of	our	 bio 	 tech 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	on	our	campus	,	and	not	giving	 student 	 s 	 	the	 the 	 ories 	 	,	but	 hav 	 ing 	 	them	struggle	with	 t 	 hose 	 	 the 	 ories 	 	.
and	it	's	 work 	 ing 	 	so	well	that	 through 	 out 	 	our	university	system	in	maryland	,	more	and	more	 course 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 re 	 designed 	 	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	academic	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
and	what	 do 	 es 	 	all	of	that	mean	?
it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	now	,	not	just	in	science	and	 engineer 	 ing 	 	,	we	now	have	 program 	 s 	 	in	the	 art 	 s 	 	,	in	the	 human 	 ities 	 	,	in	the	social	 science 	 s 	 	,	in	teacher	education	,	even	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	for	women	in	i.t	.
if	you	do	n't	know	it	,	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	79	-	percent	decline	in	the	number	of	women	 major 	 ing 	 	in	computer	science	just	since	2000	.
and	what	i	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	is	that	what	will	make	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	will	be	building	community	among	 student 	 s 	 	,	 tell 	 ing 	 	young	women	,	young	 minor 	 ity 	 	 student 	 s 	 	and	 student 	 s 	 	in	general	,	you	can	do	 th 	 is 	 	work	.
and	most	 import 	 ant 	 	,	giving	them	a	chance	to	build	that	community	with	 facul 	 ty 	 	 pull 	 ing 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	the	work	and	our	 assess 	 ing 	 	what	 work 	 s 	 	and	what	 do 	 es 	 	not	work	.
most	 import 	 ant 	 	,	if	a	student	 ha 	 s 	 	a	sense	of	self	,	it	is	 amaz 	 ing 	 	how	the	 dream 	 s 	 	and	the	 value 	 s 	 	can	make	all	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	the	world	.
when	i	was	a	12	-	year	-	old	child	in	the	jail	in	birmingham	,	i	 ke 	 pt 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	i	wonder	what	my	future	could	be	.	``	i	had	no	idea	that	it	was	possible	for	 th 	 is 	 	little	black	boy	in	birmingham	to	one	day	be	 p 	 resident 	 	of	a	university	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 student 	 s 	 	from	150	 count 	 ries 	 	,	where	 student 	 s 	 	are	not	there	just	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	,	where	they	love	 learn 	 ing 	 	,	where	they	enjoy	 be 	 ing 	 	the	best	,	where	they	will	one	day	change	the	world	.
aristotle	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	excellence	is	never	an	accident	.
it	is	the	result	of	high	 intent 	 ion 	 	,	 since 	 re 	 	effort	and	intelligent	 exec 	 ution 	 	.
it	 represent 	 s 	 	the	 wise 	 st 	 	option	among	 man 	 y 	 	 alter 	 native 	 s 	 	.	``
and	then	he	 s 	 aid 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 give 	 s 	 	me	 goose 	 bump 	 s 	 	.
