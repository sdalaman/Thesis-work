we	live	in	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 bus 	 y 	 	world	.
the	pace	of	life	is	often	 fr 	 antic 	 	,	our	 mind 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 ways 	 	 bus 	 y 	 	,	and	we	're	 al 	 ways 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	.
so	with	that	in	mind	,	i	'd	like	you	just	to	take	a	moment	to	think	,	when	did	you	last	take	any	time	to	do	 noth 	 ing 	 	?
just	10	 minute 	 s 	 	,	 un 	 disturb 	 ed 	 	?
and	when	i	say	 noth 	 ing 	 	,	i	do	mean	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
so	that	's	no	 email 	 ing 	 	,	 text 	 ing 	 	,	no	 inter 	 net 	 	,	no	tv	,	no	 chat 	 ting 	 	,	no	eating	,	no	 read 	 ing 	 	,	not	even	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	 re 	 mini 	 s 	 c 	 ing 	 	about	the	past	or	 plan 	 ning 	 	for	the	future	.
 simpl 	 y 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
i	see	a	lot	of	 ver 	 y 	 	blank	 face 	 s 	 	.
my	 think 	 ing 	 	is	,	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	have	to	go	a	long	way	back	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	thing	,	right	?
we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	our	mind	.
the	mind	,	our	most	 valu 	 able 	 	and	precious	resource	,	through	which	we	experience	every	single	moment	of	our	life	,	the	mind	that	we	 re 	 ly 	 	 up 	 on 	 	to	be	happy	,	content	,	 emotion 	 ally 	 	 s 	 table 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	,	and	at	the	same	time	to	be	kind	and	 thought 	 ful 	 	and	 consider 	 ate 	 	in	our	 relationship 	 s 	 	with	 other 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	same	mind	that	we	depend	 up 	 on 	 	to	be	focused	,	creative	,	 spontane 	 ous 	 	,	and	to	perform	at	our	 ver 	 y 	 	best	in	 every 	 thing 	 	that	we	do	.
and	yet	,	we	do	n't	take	any	time	out	to	look	after	it	.
in	fact	,	we	 s 	 pend 	 	more	time	looking	after	our	 car 	 s 	 	,	our	 clothe 	 s 	 	and	our	hair	than	we
--	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	not	our	hair	,	but	you	see	where	i	'm	going	.
the	result	,	of	course	,	is	that	we	get	 stress 	 ed 	 	.
you	know	,	the	mind	whizzes	away	like	a	 wash 	 ing 	 	machine	going	round	and	round	,	 lot 	 s 	 	of	difficult	,	 con 	 fusing 	 	 emotion 	 s 	 	,	and	we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	know	how	to	deal	with	that	,
and	the	 s 	 ad 	 	fact	is	that	we	are	so	 distract 	 ed 	 	that	we	're	no	 long 	 er 	 	present	in	the	world	in	which	we	live	.
we	 mis 	 s 	 	out	on	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	most	 import 	 ant 	 	to	us	,
and	the	crazy	thing	is	that	 every 	 body 	 	just	 assum 	 es 	 	,	well	,	that	's	the	way	life	is	,	so	we	've	just	kind	of	got	to	get	on	with	it	.
that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	not	how	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	.
so	i	was	about	11	when	i	went	 a 	 long 	 	to	my	first	 medit 	 ation 	 	class	.
and	trust	me	,	it	had	all	the	 stereo 	 type 	 s 	 	that	you	can	imagine	,	the	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	cross	-	legged	on	the	floor	,	the	incense	,	the	 herb 	 al 	 	tea	,	the	 veget 	 arian 	 s 	 	,	the	whole	deal	,
but	my	mom	was	going	and	i	was	 intrigu 	 ed 	 	,	so	i	went	 a 	 long 	 	with	her	.
i	'd	 al 	 so 	 	 s 	 een 	 	a	few	 k 	 ung 	 	fu	 movie 	 s 	 	,	and	 secret 	 ly 	 	i	kind	of	thought	i	might	be	able	to	learn	how	to	fly	,
but	i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	young	at	the	time	.
now	 a 	 s 	 	i	was	there	,	i	guess	,	like	a	lot	of	people	,	i	 assum 	 ed 	 	that	it	was	just	an	 aspir 	 in 	 	for	the	mind	.
you	get	 stress 	 ed 	 	,	you	do	some	 medit 	 ation 	 	.
i	had	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	thought	that	it	could	be	sort	of	 prevent 	 ative 	 	in	nature	,	 un 	 til 	 	i	was	about	20	,	when	a	number	of	 thing 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	my	life	in	 quit 	 e 	 	quick	 success 	 ion 	 	,
 re 	 ally 	 	serious	 thing 	 s 	 	which	just	 flip 	 ped 	 	my	life	 up 	 side 	 	down	and	all	of	a	sudden	i	was	 in 	 un 	 d 	 ated 	 	with	 thought 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 un 	 d 	 ated 	 	with	difficult	 emotion 	 s 	 	that	i	did	n't	know	how	to	cope	with	.
every	time	i	sort	of	 push 	 ed 	 	one	down	,	 an 	 other 	 	one	would	just	sort	of	pop	back	up	 aga 	 in 	 	.
it	was	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 stress 	 ful 	 	time	.
i	guess	we	all	deal	with	stress	in	different	ways	.
some	people	will	bury	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	work	,	 grat 	 e 	 ful 	 	for	the	 distract 	 ion 	 	.
 other 	 s 	 	will	turn	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	family	,	looking	for	support	.
some	people	hit	the	bottle	,	start	taking	 medic 	 ation 	 	.
my	own	way	of	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	it	was	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	monk	.
so	i	quit	my	degree	,	i	headed	off	to	the	himalayas	,	i	 be 	 came 	 	a	monk	,	and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	 medit 	 ation 	 	.
people	often	ask	me	what	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	that	time	.
well	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	it	 change 	 d 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
let	's	face	it	,	 be 	 coming 	 	a	 celib 	 ate 	 	monk	is	going	to	change	a	number	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
but	it	was	more	than	that	.
it	taught	me	--	it	 g 	 ave 	 	me	a	 great 	 er 	 	 appreci 	 ation 	 	,	an	 understand 	 ing 	 	for	the	present	moment	.
by	that	i	mean	not	 be 	 ing 	 	lost	in	thought	,	not	 be 	 ing 	 	 distract 	 ed 	 	,	not	 be 	 ing 	 	 overwhelm 	 ed 	 	by	difficult	 emotion 	 s 	 	,	but	 in 	 stead 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	how	to	be	in	the	here	and	now	,	how	to	be	 mind 	 ful 	 	,	how	to	be	present	.
i	think	the	present	moment	is	so	 under 	 rated 	 	.
it	 sound 	 s 	 	so	 ordin 	 ary 	 	,	and	yet	we	 s 	 pend 	 	so	little	time	in	the	present	moment	that	it	's	 any 	 thing 	 	but	 ordin 	 ary 	 	.
there	was	a	research	paper	that	came	out	of	harvard	,	just	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	that	 s 	 aid 	 	on	average	our	 mind 	 s 	 	are	lost	in	thought	 al 	 most 	 	47	percent	of	the	time	.
forty	-	seven	percent	.
at	the	same	time	,	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	constant	mind	-	 wander 	 ing 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	a	direct	cause	of	 un 	 happiness 	 	.
now	we	're	not	here	for	that	long	 any 	 way 	 	,	but	to	 s 	 pend 	 	 al 	 most 	 	half	of	our	life	lost	in	thought	and	 potential 	 ly 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 un 	 happy 	 	,	dunno	,	it	just	kind	of	 seem 	 s 	 	tragic	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	when	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	we	can	do	about	it	,
when	there	's	a	positive	,	practical	,	 achiev 	 able 	 	,	 scientific 	 ally 	 	proven	 techni 	 que 	 	which	 allow 	 s 	 	our	mind	to	be	more	 health 	 y 	 	,	to	be	more	 mind 	 ful 	 	and	less	 distract 	 ed 	 	.
and	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	of	it	is	that	even	 th 	 ough 	 	it	need	 on 	 ly 	 	take	about	10	 minute 	 s 	 	a	day	,	it	 impact 	 s 	 	our	entire	life	.
but	we	need	to	know	how	to	do	it	.
we	need	an	 exercis 	 e 	 	.	we	need	a	 frame 	 work 	 	to	learn	how	to	be	more	 mind 	 ful 	 	.
that	's	 essential 	 ly 	 	what	 medit 	 ation 	 	is	.	it	's	familiarizing	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	with	the	present	moment	.
but	we	 al 	 so 	 	need	to	know	how	to	approach	it	in	the	right	way	to	get	the	best	from	it	.
and	that	's	what	these	are	for	,	in	case	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	 wonder 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	most	people	 assum 	 e 	 	that	 medit 	 ation 	 	is	all	about	 stop 	 ping 	 	 thought 	 s 	 	,	 get 	 ting 	 	rid	of	 emotion 	 s 	 	,	 some 	 how 	 	 controll 	 ing 	 	the	mind	,	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	different	from	that	.
it	's	more	about	 step 	 ping 	 	back	,	 see 	 ing 	 	the	thought	 clear 	 ly 	 	,	 witness 	 ing 	 	it	coming	and	going	,	 emotion 	 s 	 	coming	and	going	 with 	 out 	 	judgment	,	but	with	a	 relax 	 ed 	 	,	focused	mind	.
so	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	right	now	,	if	i	focus	too	much	on	the	 ball 	 s 	 	,	then	there	's	no	way	that	i	can	relax	and	talk	to	you	at	the	same	time	.
 equal 	 ly 	 	,	if	i	relax	too	much	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	you	,	then	there	's	no	way	i	can	focus	on	the	 ball 	 s 	 	.	i	'm	going	to	drop	them	.
now	in	life	,	and	in	 medit 	 ation 	 	,	there	'll	be	 time 	 s 	 	when	the	focus	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	little	bit	too	 intens 	 e 	 	,	and	life	 start 	 s 	 	to	feel	a	bit	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	way	to	live	life	,	when	you	get	 th 	 is 	 	tight	and	 stress 	 ed 	 	.
at	other	 time 	 s 	 	,	we	might	take	our	foot	off	the	gas	a	little	bit	too	much	,	and	 thing 	 s 	 	just	 be 	 come 	 	a	sort	of	little	bit	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
of	course	in	 medit 	 ation 	 	--	--	we	're	going	to	end	up	 fall 	 ing 	 	 a 	 sleep 	 	.
so	we	're	looking	for	a	balance	,	a	focused	 relax 	 ation 	 	where	we	can	allow	 thought 	 s 	 	to	come	and	go	 with 	 out 	 	all	the	usual	 involve 	 ment 	 	.
now	,	what	 usual 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	when	we	're	 learn 	 ing 	 	to	be	 mind 	 ful 	 	is	that	we	get	 distract 	 ed 	 	by	a	thought	.
let	's	say	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 anx 	 ious 	 	thought	.
so	 every 	 thing 	 	's	going	fine	,	and	then	we	see	the	 anx 	 ious 	 	thought	,	and	it	's	like	,	``	oh	,	did	n't	 real 	 ize 	 	i	was	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	that	.	``
you	go	back	to	it	,	repeat	it	.	``	oh	,	i	am	 worri 	 ed 	 	.
oh	,	i	 re 	 ally 	 	am	 worri 	 ed 	 	.	 w 	 ow 	 	,	there	's	so	much	 anxie 	 ty 	 	.	``
and	before	we	know	it	,	right	,	we	're	 anx 	 ious 	 	about	 feel 	 ing 	 	 anx 	 ious 	 	.
you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	crazy	.	we	do	 th 	 is 	 	all	the	time	,	even	on	an	 every 	 day 	 	level	.
if	you	think	about	the	last	time	,	i	dunno	,	you	had	a	wobbly	tooth	.
you	know	it	's	wobbly	,	and	you	know	that	it	 hurt 	 s 	 	.
but	what	do	you	do	every	20	,	30	 second 	 s 	 	?
it	 do 	 es 	 	hurt	.	and	we	reinforce	the	 story 	 line 	 	,	right	?
and	we	just	keep	 tell 	 ing 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	and	we	do	it	all	the	time	.	and	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	in	 learn 	 ing 	 	to	watch	the	mind	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	that	we	can	start	to	let	go	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 story 	 lines 	 	and	 pattern 	 s 	 	of	mind	.
but	when	you	 s 	 it 	 	down	and	you	watch	the	mind	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	,	you	might	see	 man 	 y 	 	different	 pattern 	 s 	 	.
you	might	find	a	mind	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 rest 	 less 	 	and	--	the	whole	time	.
do	n't	be	 surprise 	 d 	 	if	you	feel	a	bit	 agit 	 ated 	 	in	your	body	when	you	 s 	 it 	 	down	to	do	 noth 	 ing 	 	and	your	mind	 feel 	 s 	 	like	that	.
you	might	find	a	mind	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	dull	and	 bor 	 ing 	 	,	and	it	's	just	,	 al 	 most 	 	 mechanic 	 al 	 	,
it	just	 seem 	 s 	 	it	's	 a 	 s 	 	if	you	're	 get 	 ting 	 	up	,	going	to	work	,	eat	,	sleep	,	get	up	,	work	.
or	it	might	just	be	that	one	little	 nag 	 ging 	 	thought	that	just	 go 	 es 	 	round	and	round	and	round	your	mind	.
well	,	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	,	 medit 	 ation 	 	 off 	 ers 	 	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	,	the	potential	to	step	back	and	to	get	a	different	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	to	see	that	 thing 	 s 	 	are	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	appear	.
we	ca	n't	change	every	little	thing	that	 happen 	 s 	 	to	us	in	life	,	but	we	can	change	the	way	that	we	experience	it	.
that	's	the	potential	of	 medit 	 ation 	 	,	of	 mind 	 fulness 	 	.
you	do	n't	have	to	burn	any	incense	,	and	you	 definite 	 ly 	 	do	n't	have	to	 s 	 it 	 	on	the	floor	.
all	you	need	to	do	is	to	take	10	 minute 	 s 	 	out	a	day	to	step	back	,	to	 familiar 	 ize 	 	 your 	 self 	 	with	the	present	moment	so	that	you	get	to	experience	a	 great 	 er 	 	sense	of	focus	,	calm	and	 clar 	 ity 	 	in	your	life	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
