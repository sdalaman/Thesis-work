the	will	to	live	life	 different 	 ly 	 	can	start	in	some	of	the	most	 un 	 usual 	 	 place 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	where	i	come	from	,	todmorden	.
it	's	a	market	town	in	the	north	of	england	,	15,000	people	,	between	leeds	and	manchester	,	 fair 	 ly 	 	normal	market	town	.
it	used	to	look	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	now	it	's	more	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	with	fruit	and	 ve 	 g 	 	and	 herb 	 s 	 	 sprout 	 ing 	 	up	all	over	the	place	.
we	call	it	 propag 	 and 	 a 	 	 garden 	 ing 	 	.
corner	row	 rail 	 way 	 	,	station	car	park	,	front	of	a	health	center	,	people	's	front	 garden 	 s 	 	,	and	even	in	front	of	the	police	station	.
we	've	got	 ed 	 ible 	 	 can 	 al 	 	towpaths	,	and	we	've	got	 sprout 	 ing 	 	 cemet 	 eries 	 	.
the	 s 	 oil 	 	is	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	good	.
we	've	even	 invent 	 ed 	 	a	new	form	of	 tour 	 ism 	 	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	 veget 	 able 	 	 tour 	 ism 	 	,	and	 believ 	 e 	 	it	or	not	,	people	come	from	all	over	the	world	to	poke	around	in	our	raised	 bed 	 s 	 	,	even	when	there	's	not	much	growing	.
but	it	 start 	 s 	 	a	conversation	.
and	,	you	know	,	we	're	not	 do 	 ing 	 	it	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	 bor 	 ed 	 	.
we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	 be 	 cause 	 	we	want	to	start	a	revolution	.
we	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	answer	 th 	 is 	 	simple	question	:	can	you	find	a	 un 	 ifying 	 	language	that	 cut 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	age	and	income	and	culture	that	will	help	people	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	find	a	new	way	of	living	,	see	 space 	 s 	 	around	them	 different 	 ly 	 	,	think	about	the	 resource 	 s 	 	they	use	 different 	 ly 	 	,	interact	 different 	 ly 	 	?
can	we	find	that	language	?
and	then	,	can	we	replicate	 t 	 hose 	 	 action 	 s 	 	?
and	the	answer	would	appear	to	be	 y 	 es 	 	,	and	the	language	would	appear	to	be	food	.
so	,	three	and	a	half	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	a	few	of	us	 s 	 at 	 	around	a	kitchen	table	and	we	just	 invent 	 ed 	 	the	whole	thing	.
we	came	up	with	a	 re 	 ally 	 	simple	game	plan	that	we	put	to	a	public	 meet 	 ing 	 	.
we	did	not	consult	.	we	did	not	write	a	report	.
 en 	 ough 	 	of	all	that	.
and	we	 s 	 aid 	 	to	that	public	 meet 	 ing 	 	in	todmorden	,	look	,	let	's	imagine	that	our	town	is	focused	around	three	 plate 	 s 	 	:	a	community	plate	,	the	way	we	live	our	 every 	 day 	 	 live 	 s 	 	;	a	 learn 	 ing 	 	plate	,	what	we	teach	our	 kid 	 s 	 	in	school	and	what	new	 skill 	 s 	 	we	share	 among 	 st 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	;	and	business	,	what	we	do	with	the	pound	in	our	pocket	and	which	 business 	 es 	 	we	 choos 	 e 	 	to	support	.
now	,	let	's	imagine	 t 	 hose 	 	 plate 	 s 	 	 agit 	 ated 	 	with	community	 action 	 s 	 	around	food	.
if	we	start	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	community	 plate 	 s 	 	 s 	 pinning 	 	,	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	great	,	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 start 	 s 	 	to	empower	people	,	but	if	we	can	then	spin	that	community	plate	with	the	 learn 	 ing 	 	plate	,	and	then	spin	it	with	the	business	plate	,	we	've	got	a	real	show	there	,	we	've	got	some	action	theater	.
we	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	build	 resili 	 ence 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
we	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	 re 	 invent 	 	community	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	and	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	it	all	 with 	 out 	 	a	 flip 	 ping 	 	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	document	.
we	've	not	 ask 	 ed 	 	 any 	 body 	 	's	 per 	 mission 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	're	just	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
and	we	are	 certain 	 ly 	 	not	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	that	check	to	drop	through	the	letterbox	before	we	start	,	and	most	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	of	all	,	we	are	not	 daunt 	 ed 	 	by	the	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	 argument 	 s 	 	that	say	,	``	these	small	 action 	 s 	 	are	 meaning 	 less 	 	in	the	face	of	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	's	 problem 	 s 	 	,	``	 be 	 cause 	 	i	have	 s 	 een 	 	the	power	of	small	 action 	 s 	 	,	and	it	is	awesome	.
so	,	back	to	the	public	 meet 	 ing 	 	.
we	put	that	 pro 	 position 	 	to	the	 meet 	 ing 	 	,	two	 second 	 s 	 	,	and	then	the	room	 explode 	 d 	 	.
i	have	never	,	ever	 experience 	 d 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	like	that	in	my	life	.
and	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	the	same	in	every	single	room	,	in	every	town	that	we	've	ever	told	our	story	.
people	are	ready	and	respond	to	the	story	of	food	.
they	want	positive	 action 	 s 	 	they	can	engage	in	,	and	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 bone 	 s 	 	,	they	know	it	's	time	to	take	personal	 respons 	 ibility 	 	and	invest	in	more	 kind 	 ness 	 	to	each	other	and	to	the	environment	.
and	since	we	had	that	 meet 	 ing 	 	three	and	a	half	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	heck	of	a	roller	 coast 	 er 	 	.
we	 start 	 ed 	 	with	a	seed	swap	,	 re 	 ally 	 	simple	stuff	,	and	then	we	took	an	area	of	land	,	a	strip	on	the	side	of	our	main	road	,	which	was	a	dog	toilet	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	and	we	 turn 	 ed 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 love 	 ly 	 	herb	garden	.
we	took	the	corner	of	the	car	park	in	the	station	that	you	saw	,	and	we	made	 veget 	 able 	 	 bed 	 s 	 	for	 every 	 body 	 	to	share	and	pick	from	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
we	went	to	the	 doctor 	 s 	 	.	we	've	just	had	a	6	-	million	-	pound	health	center	built	in	todmorden	,	and	for	some	reason	that	i	can	not	 com 	 prehend 	 	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 surround 	 ed 	 	by	 prick 	 ly 	 	 plant 	 s 	 	.
so	we	went	to	the	 doctor 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	would	you	mind	us	taking	them	up	?	``	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 absolute 	 ly 	 	fine	,	 provide 	 d 	 	you	get	 plan 	 ning 	 	 per 	 mission 	 	and	you	do	it	in	latin	and	you	do	it	in	 trip 	 lic 	 ate 	 	,	``	so	we	did	--	--	and	now	there	are	fruit	 tree 	 s 	 	and	 bush 	 es 	 	and	 herb 	 s 	 	and	 veget 	 able 	 s 	 	around	that	doctor	's	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	.
and	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	other	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	,	like	the	corn	that	was	in	front	of	the	police	station	,	and	the	old	people	's	home	that	we	've	 plant 	 ed 	 	it	with	food	that	they	can	pick	and	grow	.
but	it	is	n't	just	about	growing	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	all	are	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	 jig 	 saw 	 	.
it	's	about	taking	 t 	 hose 	 	 art 	 istic 	 	people	in	your	community	and	 do 	 ing 	 	some	fabulous	 design 	 s 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	raised	 bed 	 s 	 	to	explain	to	people	what	's	growing	there	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	so	 man 	 y 	 	people	that	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 recogn 	 ize 	 	a	 veget 	 able 	 	 un 	 less 	 	it	's	in	a	bit	of	plastic	with	a	bit	of	an	 instruct 	 ion 	 	 pack 	 et 	 	on	the	top	.
so	we	have	some	people	who	designed	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	``	if	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	do	n't	pick	it	,	but	if	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	help	 your 	 self 	 	.	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	about	sharing	and	 invest 	 ing 	 	in	 kind 	 ness 	 	.
and	for	 t 	 hose 	 	people	that	do	n't	want	to	do	either	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	they	can	cook	,	so	we	pick	them	 season 	 ally 	 	and	then	we	go	on	the	street	,	or	in	the	pub	,	or	in	the	church	,	or	 where 	 ver 	 	people	are	living	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	about	us	going	to	the	people	and	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	we	are	all	part	of	the	local	food	 jig 	 saw 	 	,	we	are	all	part	of	a	solution	.	``	and	then	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	know	we	've	got	 veget 	 able 	 	 tourist 	 s 	 	and	we	love	them	to	bits	and	they	're	 absolute 	 ly 	 	fantastic	,	we	thought	,	what	could	we	do	to	give	them	an	even	better	experience	?
so	we	 invent 	 ed 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	,	of	course	,	the	 in 	 credible 	 	 ed 	 ible 	 	green	route	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	route	of	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	 garden 	 s 	 	,	and	 ed 	 ible 	 	towpaths	,	and	bee	-	friendly	 s 	 ites 	 	,	and	the	story	of	 pollinat 	 ors 	 	,	and	it	's	a	route	that	we	designed	that	 take 	 s 	 	people	through	the	whole	of	our	town	,	past	our	 cafe 	 s 	 	and	our	small	 shop 	 s 	 	,	through	our	market	,	not	just	to	and	fro	from	the	 super 	 market 	 	,
and	we	're	 hop 	 ing 	 	that	,	in	changing	people	's	footfall	around	our	town	,	we	're	 al 	 so 	 	changing	 the 	 ir 	 	behavior	.
and	then	there	's	the	second	plate	,	the	 learn 	 ing 	 	plate	.
well	,	we	're	in	 partner 	 ship 	 	with	a	high	school	.
we	've	 create 	 d 	 	a	company	.	we	are	 design 	 ing 	 	and	building	an	 aquaponic 	 s 	 	unit	in	some	land	that	was	spare	at	the	back	of	the	high	school	,	like	you	do	,	and	now	we	're	going	to	be	growing	fish	and	 veget 	 able 	 s 	 	in	an	 orc 	 hard 	 	with	bees	,
and	the	 kid 	 s 	 	are	 help 	 ing 	 	us	build	that	,
and	the	 kid 	 s 	 	are	on	the	board	,	and	 be 	 cause 	 	the	community	was	 re 	 ally 	 	keen	on	 work 	 ing 	 	with	the	high	school	,	the	high	school	is	now	 teach 	 ing 	 	 agricultur 	 e 	 	,
and	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 teach 	 ing 	 	 agricultur 	 e 	 	,	we	 start 	 ed 	 	to	think	,	how	could	we	then	get	 t 	 hose 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	that	never	had	a	 qual 	 ification 	 	before	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	but	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	growing	,	how	can	we	give	them	some	more	experience	?
so	we	got	some	land	that	was	 don 	 ated 	 	by	a	local	garden	center	.
it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 mud 	 dy 	 	,	but	in	a	 tru 	 ly 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	way	,	 total 	 ly 	 	voluntary	-	led	,	we	have	 turn 	 ed 	 	that	 in 	 to 	 	a	market	garden	training	center	,
and	that	is	polytunnels	and	raised	 bed 	 s 	 	and	all	the	 thing 	 s 	 	you	need	to	get	the	 s 	 oil 	 	under	your	 finger 	 s 	 	and	think	 may 	 be 	 	there	's	a	job	in	 th 	 is 	 	for	me	in	the	future	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	that	,	some	local	 academic 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	,	we	could	help	design	a	commercial	 horti 	 culture 	 	course	for	you	.
there	's	not	one	that	we	know	of	.	``
so	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	that	,	and	we	're	going	to	launch	it	 lat 	 er 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	,
and	it	's	all	an	experiment	,	and	it	's	all	voluntary	.
and	then	there	's	the	third	plate	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	walk	through	an	 ed 	 ible 	 	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	,	and	if	you	're	 learn 	 ing 	 	new	 skill 	 s 	 	,	and	if	you	start	to	get	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	what	's	growing	 season 	 ally 	 	,	you	might	just	want	to	 s 	 pend 	 	more	of	your	own	money	in	support	of	local	 produce 	 rs 	 	,	not	just	 ve 	 g 	 	,	but	meat	and	cheese	and	beer	and	 what 	 ever 	 	else	it	might	be	.
but	then	,	we	're	just	a	community	group	,	you	know	.
we	're	just	all	 volunteer 	 s 	 	.	what	could	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	?
so	we	did	some	 re 	 ally 	 	simple	 thing 	 s 	 	.
we	fundraised	,	we	got	some	blackboards	,	we	put	``	 in 	 credible 	 	 ed 	 ible 	 	``	on	the	top	,	we	 g 	 ave 	 	it	every	market	 trade 	 r 	 	that	was	selling	 local 	 ly 	 	,	and	they	 s 	 crib 	 bled 	 	on	what	they	 we 	 re 	 	selling	in	any	one	week	.
 re 	 ally 	 	popular	.	people	congregated	around	it	.
 sale 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	up	.
and	then	,	we	had	a	chat	with	the	 farm 	 ers 	 	,	and	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	serious	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	``	but	they	did	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	us	,	so	we	thought	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	what	should	we	do	?	i	know	.	if	we	can	create	a	campaign	around	one	product	and	show	them	there	is	local	 loyal 	 ty 	 	to	that	product	,	 may 	 be 	 	they	'll	change	 the 	 ir 	 	mind	and	see	we	're	serious	.
so	we	 launch 	 ed 	 	a	campaign	--	 be 	 cause 	 	it	just	 amuse 	 s 	 	me	--	 call 	 ed 	 	every	egg	 matter 	 s 	 	.
and	what	we	did	was	we	put	people	on	our	egg	map	.
it	's	a	 styl 	 ized 	 	map	of	togmorden	.
 any 	 body 	 	that	's	selling	 the 	 ir 	 	excess	 egg 	 s 	 	at	the	garden	gate	,	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 legal 	 ly 	 	,	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 neighbor 	 s 	 	,	we	've	 s 	 tuck 	 	on	there	.	we	 start 	 ed 	 	with	four	,	and	we	've	now	got	64	on	,	and	the	result	of	that	was	that	people	 we 	 re 	 	then	going	 in 	 to 	 	 shop 	 s 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	for	a	local	todmorden	egg	,	and	the	result	of	that	was	,	some	 farm 	 ers 	 	upped	the	amount	of	 flock 	 s 	 	they	got	of	free	range	 bird 	 s 	 	,	and	then	they	went	on	to	meat	 bird 	 s 	 	,
and	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	these	are	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	small	 step 	 s 	 	,	that	increasing	local	economic	confidence	is	 start 	 ing 	 	to	play	out	in	a	number	of	ways	,
and	we	now	have	 farm 	 ers 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	cheese
and	they	've	upped	 the 	 ir 	 	 flock 	 s 	 	and	rare	breed	 pig 	 s 	 	,	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	pasties	and	pies	and	 thing 	 s 	 	that	they	would	have	never	 d 	 one 	 	before	.
we	've	got	increasing	market	 stall 	 s 	 	selling	local	food	,
and	in	a	survey	that	local	 student 	 s 	 	did	for	us	,	49	percent	of	all	food	 trade 	 rs 	 	in	that	town	 s 	 aid 	 	that	 the 	 ir 	 	bottom	line	had	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	what	we	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	.
and	we	're	just	 volunteer 	 s 	 	and	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	an	experiment	.
now	,	 non 	 e 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	rocket	science	.
it	 certain 	 ly 	 	is	not	clever	,	and	it	's	not	original	.
but	it	is	 join 	 ed 	 	up	,	and	it	is	inclusive	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	 move 	 ment 	 	for	 t 	 hose 	 	people	that	are	going	to	sort	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	out	 any 	 way 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 move 	 ment 	 	for	 every 	 one 	 	.
we	have	a	 mot 	 to 	 	:	if	you	eat	,	you	're	in	.
 a 	 cross 	 	age	,	 a 	 cross 	 	income	,	 a 	 cross 	 	culture	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	a	roller	 coast 	 er 	 	experience	,	but	going	back	to	that	first	question	that	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	is	it	 replica 	 ble 	 	?	 yea 	 h 	 	.	it	most	 certain 	 ly 	 	is	 replica 	 ble 	 	.
more	than	30	 town 	 s 	 	in	england	now	are	 s 	 pinning 	 	the	 in 	 credible 	 	 ed 	 ible 	 	plate	.
 which 	 ever 	 	way	they	want	to	do	it	,	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 vol 	 ition 	 	,	they	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 live 	 s 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	,
and	 world 	 wide 	 	,	we	've	got	 commun 	 ities 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	america	and	japan	--	it	's	 in 	 credible 	 	,	is	n't	it	?	i	mean	,
america	and	japan	and	new	zealand	.
people	after	the	 earth 	 quake 	 	in	new	zealand	 visit 	 ed 	 	us	in	order	to	 in 	 corporate 	 	some	of	 th 	 is 	 	public	spiritedness	around	local	growing	 in 	 to 	 	the	heart	of	christchurch	.
and	 non 	 e 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 take 	 s 	 	more	money	and	 non 	 e 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 demand 	 s 	 	a	 bureau 	 cracy 	 	,	but	it	 do 	 es 	 	demand	that	you	think	 thing 	 s 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	and	you	are	prepared	to	bend	 budget 	 s 	 	and	work	 program 	 s 	 	in	order	to	create	that	 support 	 ive 	 	 frame 	 work 	 	that	 commun 	 ities 	 	can	 bounc 	 e 	 	off	.
and	there	's	some	great	 idea 	 s 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	in	our	patch	.
our	local	 author 	 ity 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	to	make	 every 	 where 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	 ed 	 ible 	 	,	and	in	support	of	that	have	 decide 	 d 	 	to	do	two	 thing 	 s 	 	.
first	,	they	're	going	to	create	an	asset	register	of	spare	land	that	they	've	got	,	put	it	in	a	food	bank	so	that	 commun 	 ities 	 	can	use	that	 where 	 ver 	 	they	live	,	and	they	're	going	to	 under 	 pin 	 	that	with	a	 licens 	 e 	 	.
and	then	they	've	 s 	 aid 	 	to	every	single	one	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 work 	 force 	 	,	if	you	can	,	help	 t 	 hose 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	grow	,	and	help	them	to	maintain	 the 	 ir 	 	 space 	 s 	 	.
 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	 action 	 s 	 	on	the	ground	from	local	government	.	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	mainstreamed	.
