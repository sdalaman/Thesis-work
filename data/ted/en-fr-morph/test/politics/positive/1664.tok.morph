in	my	previous	life	,	i	was	an	artist	.
i	still	paint	.	i	love	art	.
i	love	the	joy	that	color	can	give	to	our	 live 	 s 	 	and	to	our	 commun 	 ities 	 	,	and	i	try	to	 br 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	of	the	artist	in	me	in	my	 politic 	 s 	 	,	and	i	see	part	of	my	job	 to 	 day 	 	,	the	reason	for	 be 	 ing 	 	here	,	not	just	to	campaign	for	my	party	,	but	for	 politic 	 s 	 	,	and	the	role	it	can	play	for	the	better	in	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
for	11	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	was	mayor	of	tirana	,	our	capital	.
we	 face 	 d 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 challeng 	 es 	 	.
art	was	part	of	the	answer	,	and	my	name	,	in	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	was	linked	with	two	 thing 	 s 	 	:	 demo 	 lit 	 ion 	 	of	 il 	 legal 	 	 construction 	 s 	 	in	order	to	get	public	space	back	,	and	use	of	 color 	 s 	 	in	order	to	 rev 	 ive 	 	the	hope	that	had	 be 	 en 	 	lost	in	my	city	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	use	of	 color 	 s 	 	was	not	just	an	 art 	 istic 	 	act	.
 ra 	 ther 	 	,	it	was	a	form	of	 politic 	 al 	 	action	in	a	 con 	 text 	 	when	the	city	budget	i	had	 avail 	 able 	 	after	 be 	 ing 	 	 elect 	 ed 	 	 amount 	 ed 	 	to	zero	 com 	 ma 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	.
when	we	 paint 	 ed 	 	the	first	building	,	by	 splash 	 ing 	 	a	 radi 	 ant 	 	 o 	 range 	 	on	the	 som 	 ber 	 	gray	of	a	facade	,	 some 	 thing 	 	 un 	 imagin 	 able 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
there	was	a	traffic	jam	and	a	crowd	of	people	 gather 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	if	it	 we 	 re 	 	the	location	of	some	spectacular	accident	,	or	the	sudden	 sight 	 ing 	 	of	a	 visit 	 ing 	 	pop	star	.
the	french	e.u	.	official	in	charge	of	the	 fund 	 ing 	 	 rush 	 ed 	 	to	block	the	 paint 	 ing 	 	.
he	 screech 	 ed 	 	that	he	would	block	the	 fin 	 anc 	 ing 	 	.
``	but	why	?	``	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	him	.
``	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 color 	 s 	 	you	have	 order 	 ed 	 	do	not	meet	european	 standard 	 s 	 	,	``	he	 re 	 plied 	 	.
``	well	,	``	i	told	him	,	``	the	 surround 	 ing 	 s 	 	do	not	meet	european	 standard 	 s 	 	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	what	we	want	,	but	we	will	 choos 	 e 	 	the	 color 	 s 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	we	want	.
and	if	you	do	not	let	us	 continu 	 e 	 	with	our	work	,	i	will	hold	a	press	 con 	 ference 	 	here	,	right	now	,	right	in	 th 	 is 	 	road	,	and	we	will	tell	people	that	you	look	to	me	just	like	the	 censor 	 s 	 	of	the	 social 	 ist 	 	 real 	 ism 	 	era	.	``
then	he	was	kind	of	 trouble 	 d 	 	,	and	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	for	a	 com 	 promise 	 	.
but	i	told	him	no	,	i	'm	sorry	,	 com 	 promise 	 	in	 color 	 s 	 	is	gray	,	and	we	have	 en 	 ough 	 	gray	to	last	us	a	 life 	 time 	 	.
so	it	's	time	for	change	.
the	 rehabilit 	 ation 	 	of	public	 space 	 s 	 	 re 	 viv 	 ed 	 	the	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	 belong 	 ing 	 	to	a	city	that	people	lost	.
the	 pri 	 de 	 	of	people	about	 the 	 ir 	 	own	place	of	living	,	and	there	 we 	 re 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	that	had	 be 	 en 	 	buried	deep	for	 year 	 s 	 	under	the	 fur 	 y 	 	of	the	 il 	 legal 	 	,	 bar 	 bar 	 ic 	 	 construction 	 s 	 	that	 sp 	 rang 	 	up	in	the	public	space	.
and	when	 color 	 s 	 	came	out	 every 	 where 	 	,	a	mood	of	change	 start 	 ed 	 	 transform 	 ing 	 	the	spirit	of	people	.
big	noise	raised	up	:	``	what	is	 th 	 is 	 	?	what	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	?
what	are	 color 	 s 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	to	us	?	``
and	we	made	a	poll	,	the	most	 fasci 	 nating 	 	poll	i	've	 s 	 een 	 	in	my	life	.
we	 ask 	 ed 	 	people	,	``	do	you	want	 th 	 is 	 	action	,	and	to	have	 building 	 s 	 	 paint 	 ed 	 	like	that	?	``
and	then	the	second	question	was	,	``	do	you	want	it	to	stop	or	do	you	want	it	to	 continu 	 e 	 	?	``
to	the	first	question	,	63	percent	of	people	 s 	 aid 	 	 y 	 es 	 	,	we	like	it	.
thirty	-	seven	 s 	 aid 	 	no	,	we	do	n't	like	it	.
but	to	the	second	question	,	half	of	them	that	did	n't	like	it	,	they	 want 	 ed 	 	it	to	 continu 	 e 	 	.
so	we	 notice 	 d 	 	change	.
people	 start 	 ed 	 	to	drop	less	litter	in	the	 street 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 start 	 ed 	 	to	pay	 tax 	 es 	 	,	 start 	 ed 	 	to	feel	 some 	 thing 	 	they	had	 for 	 gotten 	 	,	and	 beaut 	 y 	 	was	 act 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 guard 	 s 	 man 	 	where	municipal	police	,	or	the	state	 it 	 self 	 	,	 we 	 re 	 	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	.
one	day	i	remember	 walk 	 ing 	 	 a 	 long 	 	a	street	that	had	just	 be 	 en 	 	 color 	 ed 	 	,	and	where	we	 we 	 re 	 	in	the	process	of	 plant 	 ing 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	,	when	i	saw	a	 shop 	 keeper 	 	and	his	wife	 put 	 ting 	 	a	glass	facade	to	 the 	 ir 	 	shop	.	they	had	 throw 	 n 	 	the	old	 shut 	 ter 	 	in	the	garbage	 collect 	 ion 	 	place	.
``	why	did	you	throw	away	the	 shut 	 ter 	 s 	 	?	``	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	him	.
``	well	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	street	is	 safe 	 r 	 	now	,	``	they	 answer 	 ed 	 	.
``	 safe 	 r 	 	?	why	?	they	have	 post 	 ed 	 	more	 police 	 men 	 	here	?	``
``	come	on	,	man	!	what	 police 	 men 	 	?
you	can	see	it	for	 your 	 self 	 	.	there	are	 color 	 s 	 	,	 street 	 light 	 s 	 	,	new	 pave 	 ment 	 	with	no	 pot 	 hole 	 s 	 	,	 tree 	 s 	 	.	so	it	's	 beaut 	 iful 	 	;	it	's	safe	.	``
and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	it	was	 beaut 	 y 	 	that	was	giving	people	 th 	 is 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 protect 	 ed 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	not	a	 mis 	 place 	 d 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	.
crime	did	fall	.
the	 free 	 dom 	 	that	was	won	in	1990	 br 	 ought 	 	about	a	state	of	 anarch 	 y 	 	in	the	city	,	while	the	 bar 	 bar 	 ism 	 	of	the	'90s	 br 	 ought 	 	about	a	loss	of	hope	for	the	city	.
the	paint	on	the	 wall 	 s 	 	did	not	feed	children	,	nor	did	it	tend	the	sick	or	 educ 	 ate 	 	the	 ignor 	 ant 	 	,	but	it	 g 	 ave 	 	hope	and	light	,	and	 help 	 ed 	 	to	make	people	see	there	could	be	a	different	way	of	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	a	different	spirit	,	a	different	feel	to	our	 live 	 s 	 	,	and	that	if	we	 br 	 ought 	 	the	same	energy	and	hope	to	our	 politic 	 s 	 	,	we	could	build	a	better	life	for	each	other	and	for	our	country	.
we	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	123,000	 ton 	 s 	 	of	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	from	the	 river 	 bank 	 s 	 	.
we	 demolish 	 ed 	 	more	than	5,000	 il 	 legal 	 	 building 	 s 	 	all	over	the	city	,	up	to	eight	 st 	 ories 	 	high	,	the	 tall 	 est 	 	of	them	.
we	 plant 	 ed 	 	55,000	 tree 	 s 	 	and	 bush 	 es 	 	in	the	 street 	 s 	 	.
we	 establish 	 ed 	 	a	green	tax	,	and	then	 every 	 body 	 	 accept 	 ed 	 	it	and	all	 business 	 men 	 	paid	it	 regular 	 ly 	 	.
by	 mean 	 s 	 	of	open	 com 	 petition 	 s 	 	,	we	 manage 	 d 	 	to	recruit	in	our	 administr 	 ation 	 	 man 	 y 	 	young	people	,	and	we	thus	 manage 	 d 	 	to	build	a	de	-	 politic 	 ized 	 	public	institution	where	men	and	women	 we 	 re 	 	 equal 	 ly 	 	 represent 	 ed 	 	.

when	i	told	the	world	bank	 director 	 s 	 	that	i	 want 	 ed 	 	them	to	finance	a	project	to	build	a	model	 re 	 ception 	 	hall	for	 citizen 	 s 	 	 precise 	 ly 	 	in	order	to	fight	 en 	 demic 	 	 dai 	 ly 	 	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	,	they	did	not	understand	me	.
but	people	 we 	 re 	 	 wait 	 ing 	 	in	long	 queue 	 s 	 	under	 s 	 un 	 	and	under	rain	in	order	to	get	a	certificate	or	just	a	simple	answer	from	two	 tin 	 y 	 	 window 	 s 	 	of	two	metal	 kiosk 	 s 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 pay 	 ing 	 	in	order	to	skip	the	queue	,	the	long	queue	.
the	 re 	 ply 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 request 	 s 	 	was	met	by	a	voice	coming	from	 th 	 is 	 	dark	hole	,	and	,	on	the	other	hand	,	a	 myster 	 ious 	 	hand	coming	out	to	take	 the 	 ir 	 	 document 	 s 	 	while	 search 	 ing 	 	through	old	 document 	 s 	 	for	the	bribe	.
we	could	change	the	 in 	 visible 	 	clerks	 with 	 in 	 	the	 kiosk 	 s 	 	,	every	week	,	but	we	could	not	change	 th 	 is 	 	corrupt	practice	.
``	i	'm	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	,	``	i	told	a	german	official	with	the	world	bank	,	``	that	it	would	be	 im 	 possible 	 	for	them	to	be	 bribe 	 d 	 	if	they	 work 	 ed 	 	in	germany	,	in	a	german	 administr 	 ation 	 	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	i	am	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	that	if	you	put	german	 official 	 s 	 	from	the	german	 administr 	 ation 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 hole 	 s 	 	,	they	would	be	 bribe 	 d 	 	just	the	same	.	``

we	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	the	 kiosk 	 s 	 	.
we	built	the	bright	new	 re 	 ception 	 	hall	that	made	people	,	tirana	 citizen 	 s 	 	,	think	they	had	 travel 	 ed 	 	 a 	 broad 	 	when	they	 enter 	 ed 	 	to	make	 the 	 ir 	 	 request 	 s 	 	.
we	 create 	 d 	 	an	 on 	 line 	 	system	of	control	and	so	 speed 	 ed 	 	up	all	the	 process 	 es 	 	.
