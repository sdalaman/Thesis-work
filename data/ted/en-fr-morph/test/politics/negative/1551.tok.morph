i	'm	going	to	tell	you	about	why	i	 be 	 came 	 	a	 sculpt 	 or 	 	,	and	you	may	think	that	 sculpt 	 ors 	 	,	well	,	they	deal	with	meta	,	they	deal	with	 object 	 s 	 	,	they	deal	with	bodies	,	but	i	think	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	what	i	care	about	most	is	making	space	,	and	that	's	what	i	've	 call 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	talk	:	making	space	.
space	that	 exist 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	us	,	and	 with 	 out 	 	us	.
so	,	when	i	was	a	child	,	i	do	n't	know	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	grew	up	in	the	'50s	,	but	i	was	 s 	 ent 	 	 up 	 stair 	 s 	 	for	an	 enforce 	 d 	 	rest	.
it	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	idea	.	i	mean	,	after	lunch	,	you	're	,	you	know	,	you	're	six	,	and	you	want	to	go	and	climb	a	tree	.
but	i	had	to	go	 up 	 stair 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 tin 	 y 	 	little	room	that	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	made	out	of	an	old	 balc 	 ony 	 	,	so	it	was	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	hot	,	small	and	light	,	and	i	had	to	lie	there	.	it	was	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	.
but	 any 	 way 	 	,	for	some	reason	,	i	 promise 	 d 	 	 my 	 self 	 	that	i	was	n't	going	to	move	,	that	i	was	going	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	thing	that	 mum 	 my 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	me	to	do	.
and	there	i	was	,	 ly 	 ing 	 	there	in	 th 	 is 	 	 tin 	 y 	 	space	,	hot	,	dark	,	 clau 	 stro 	 phobic 	 	,	matchbox	-	sized	,	 be 	 hind 	 	my	 eye 	 s 	 	,	but	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	weird	,	like	,	after	 th 	 is 	 	went	on	for	 day 	 s 	 	,	 week 	 s 	 	,	 month 	 s 	 	,	that	space	would	get	 big 	 ger 	 	and	 dark 	 er 	 	and	 cool 	 er 	 	 un 	 til 	 	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	forward	to	that	half	an	hour	of	 enforce 	 d 	 	immobility	and	rest	,	and	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	forward	to	going	to	that	place	of	 dark 	 ness 	 	.
do	you	mind	if	we	do	 some 	 thing 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	?
can	we	all	just	close	our	 eye 	 s 	 	for	a	minute	?
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	going	to	be	 freak 	 y 	 	.
it	is	n't	some	cultic	thing	.
it	's	just	,	it	's	just	,	i	just	would	like	us	all	to	go	there	.
so	i	'm	going	to	do	it	too	.	we	'll	all	be	there	together	.
so	close	your	 eye 	 s 	 	for	a	minute	.
here	we	are	,	in	a	space	,	the	 subject 	 ive 	 	,	 collect 	 ive 	 	space	of	the	 dark 	 ness 	 	of	the	body	.
i	think	of	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	place	of	 imagin 	 ation 	 	,	of	potential	,	but	what	are	 it 	 s 	 	 qual 	 ities 	 	?
it	is	objectless	.	there	are	no	 thing 	 s 	 	in	it	.
it	is	 dimension 	 less 	 	.	it	is	 limit 	 less 	 	.
it	is	 end 	 less 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	open	your	 eye 	 s 	 	.
that	's	the	space	that	i	think	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	--	which	is	a	bit	of	a	paradox	,	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	that	is	about	making	material	 pro 	 position 	 s 	 	--	but	i	think	that	's	the	space	that	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	can	connect	us	with	.
so	,	imagine	we	're	in	the	middle	of	america	.
you	're	 a 	 sleep 	 	.	you	wake	up	,	and	 with 	 out 	 	 lift 	 ing 	 	your	head	from	the	earth	on	your	 sleep 	 ing 	 	bag	,	you	can	see	for	70	 mile 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	dry	lake	bed	.
i	was	young	.	i	'd	just	 finish 	 ed 	 	art	school	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	that	was	 work 	 ing 	 	 direct 	 ly 	 	with	the	world	,	 direct 	 ly 	 	with	place	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	place	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	a	place	where	you	could	imagine	that	you	 we 	 re 	 	the	first	person	to	be	there	.
it	was	a	place	where	 noth 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	had	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	bear	with	me	.
i	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	a	hand	-	sized	stone	,	threw	it	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	i	was	able	,	it	was	about	22	 meter 	 s 	 	.
i	then	 clear 	 ed 	 	all	the	 stone 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	that	 radi 	 us 	 	and	made	a	pile	.
and	that	was	the	pile	,	by	the	way	.
and	then	,	i	stood	on	the	pile	,	and	threw	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 rock 	 s 	 	out	 aga 	 in 	 	,	and	here	is	 re 	 arrange 	 d 	 	desert	.
you	could	say	,	well	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	look	 ver 	 y 	 	different	from	when	he	 start 	 ed 	 	.
what	's	all	the	 fu 	 s 	 s 	 	about	?
in	fact	,	chris	was	 worri 	 ed 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	look	,	do	n't	show	them	that	slide	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	just	going	to	think	you	're	 an 	 other 	 	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	crazy	modern	 artist 	 s 	 	who	 do 	 es 	 	n't	do	much	.
but	the	fact	is	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	evidence	of	a	living	body	on	other	bodies	,	 rock 	 s 	 	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	the	subject	of	 geo 	 logical 	 	 form 	 ation 	 	,	 ero 	 s 	 ion 	 	,	the	action	of	time	on	 object 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	place	,	in	a	way	,	that	i	just	would	like	you	to	,	in	a	way	,	look	at	 different 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	event	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	it	,	a	human	event	,	and	in	general	,	it	just	 ask 	 s 	 	us	to	look	 aga 	 in 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	world	,	so	different	from	,	in	a	way	,	the	world	that	we	have	 be 	 en 	 	sharing	with	each	other	,	the	 techno 	 logical 	 	world	,	to	look	 aga 	 in 	 	at	the	 element 	 al 	 	world	.
the	 element 	 al 	 	world	that	we	all	live	in	is	that	space	that	we	all	 visit 	 ed 	 	together	,	the	 dark 	 ness 	 	of	the	body	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	start	 aga 	 in 	 	with	that	environment	,	the	environment	of	the	 intima 	 te 	 	,	 subject 	 ive 	 	space	that	each	of	us	 live 	 s 	 	in	,	but	from	the	other	side	of	 appear 	 ance 	 	.
so	here	is	a	 dai 	 ly 	 	activity	of	the	studio	.
you	can	see	i	do	n't	do	much	.	i	'm	just	 stand 	 ing 	 	there	,	 aga 	 in 	 	with	my	 eye 	 s 	 	closed	,	and	other	people	are	 mold 	 ing 	 	me	,	evidential	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	indexical	register	of	a	lived	moment	of	a	body	in	time	.
can	we	map	that	space	,	using	the	language	of	 neutrino 	 s 	 	or	 cosm 	 ic 	 	 ray 	 s 	 	,	taking	the	bounding	condition	of	the	body	 a 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	limit	,	but	in	complete	 revers 	 al 	 	of	,	in	a	way	,	the	most	 tradition 	 al 	 	greek	idea	of	 point 	 ing 	 	?
in	the	old	 day 	 s 	 	they	used	to	take	a	lump	of	pentelic	 mar 	 ble 	 	and	drill	from	the	surface	in	order	to	identify	the	skin	,	the	 appear 	 ance 	 	,	what	aristotle	defined	 a 	 s 	 	the	 distinct 	 ion 	 	between	 sub 	 stance 	 	and	 appear 	 ance 	 	,	the	thing	that	 make 	 s 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	visible	,	but	here	we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	from	the	other	side	.
or	can	we	do	it	 a 	 s 	 	an	exclusive	membrane	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	lead	case	made	around	the	space	that	my	body	occupied	,	but	it	's	now	void	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	work	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 learn 	 ing 	 	to	see	.	``	it	's	a	bit	of	,	well	,	we	could	call	it	night	,	we	could	call	it	the	96	percent	of	 gravit 	 y 	 	that	we	do	n't	know	about	,	dark	matter	,	 place 	 d 	 	in	space	,	 any 	 way 	 	,	 an 	 other 	 	version	of	a	human	space	in	space	at	large	,	but	i	do	n't	know	if	you	can	see	,	the	 eye 	 s 	 	are	 indic 	 ated 	 	,	they	're	closed	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 learn 	 ing 	 	to	see	``	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	about	an	object	that	 hope 	 fully 	 	 work 	 s 	 	 re 	 flex 	 ively 	 	and	 talk 	 s 	 	about	that	vision	or	 connect 	 ion 	 	with	the	 dark 	 ness 	 	of	the	body	that	i	see	 a 	 s 	 	a	space	of	potential	.
can	we	do	it	 an 	 other 	 	way	,	using	the	language	of	 particle 	 s 	 	around	a	nucleus	,	and	talk	about	the	body	 a 	 s 	 	an	energy	center	?
