so	i	'd	like	to	start	by	 focus 	 ing 	 	on	the	world	's	most	 danger 	 ous 	 	animal	.
now	,	when	you	talk	about	 danger 	 ous 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	,	most	people	might	think	of	 lion 	 s 	 	or	 tiger 	 s 	 	or	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	.
but	of	course	the	most	 danger 	 ous 	 	animal	is	the	mosquito	.
the	mosquito	 ha 	 s 	 	 kill 	 ed 	 	more	 human 	 s 	 	than	any	other	creature	in	human	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
in	fact	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	 add 	 ing 	 	them	all	together	,	the	mosquito	 ha 	 s 	 	 kill 	 ed 	 	more	 human 	 s 	 	.
and	the	mosquito	 ha 	 s 	 	 kill 	 ed 	 	more	 human 	 s 	 	than	 war 	 s 	 	and	plague	.
and	you	would	think	,	would	you	not	,	that	with	all	our	science	,	with	all	our	 advance 	 s 	 	in	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	with	better	 town 	 s 	 	,	better	 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	,	better	 sanit 	 ation 	 	,	wealth	,	that	we	would	get	better	at	 controll 	 ing 	 	 mosquito 	 s 	 	,	and	 h 	 ence 	 	 reduc 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	disease	.
and	that	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	the	case	.
if	it	was	the	case	,	we	would	n't	have	between	200	and	300	million	 case 	 s 	 	of	malaria	every	year	,	and	we	would	n't	have	a	million	and	a	half	 death 	 s 	 	from	malaria	,	and	we	would	n't	have	a	disease	that	was	 relat 	 ively 	 	 un 	 known 	 	50	 year 	 s 	 	ago	now	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	largest	mosquito	-	borne	virus	threat	that	we	have	,	and	that	's	 call 	 ed 	 	dengue	 f 	 ever 	 	.
so	50	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	no	one	had	heard	of	it	,	no	one	 certain 	 ly 	 	in	the	european	environment	.
but	dengue	 f 	 ever 	 	now	,	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	the	world	health	 organ 	 ization 	 	,	 infect 	 s 	 	between	50	and	100	million	people	every	year	,	so	that	's	 equi 	 valent 	 	to	the	whole	of	the	population	of	the	u.k.	 be 	 ing 	 	 infect 	 ed 	 	every	year	.
other	 estimate 	 s 	 	put	that	number	at	 rough 	 ly 	 	double	that	number	of	 infect 	 ions 	 	.
and	dengue	 f 	 ever 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	grown	in	speed	 quit 	 e 	 	 phenomen 	 ally 	 	.
in	the	last	50	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	incidence	of	dengue	 ha 	 s 	 	grown	thirtyfold	.
now	let	me	tell	you	a	little	bit	about	what	dengue	 f 	 ever 	 	is	,	for	 t 	 hose 	 	who	do	n't	know	.
now	let	's	 assum 	 e 	 	you	go	on	 holi 	 day 	 	.
let	's	 assum 	 e 	 	you	go	to	the	caribbean	,	or	you	might	go	to	mexico	.	you	might	go	to	latin	america	,	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	,	africa	,	 any 	 where 	 	in	saudi	arabia	.
you	might	go	to	india	,	the	far	east	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	matter	.	it	's	the	same	mosquito	,	and	it	's	the	same	disease	.	you	're	at	risk	.
and	let	's	 assum 	 e 	 	you	're	bitten	by	a	mosquito	that	's	 carry 	 ing 	 	that	virus	.
well	,	you	could	develop	flu	-	like	 symptom 	 s 	 	.
they	could	be	 quit 	 e 	 	mild	.
you	could	develop	 nause 	 a 	 	,	 head 	 ache 	 	,	and	you	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	feel	like	your	 bone 	 s 	 	are	 break 	 ing 	 	.
and	that	's	the	 nick 	 name 	 	 give 	 n 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	disease	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	breakbone	 f 	 ever 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	how	you	can	feel	.
now	the	odd	thing	is	,	is	that	once	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	bitten	by	 th 	 is 	 	mosquito	,	and	you	've	had	 th 	 is 	 	disease	,	your	body	 develop 	 s 	 	 anti 	 bodies 	 	,	so	if	you	're	bitten	 aga 	 in 	 	with	that	 s 	 train 	 	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	affect	you	.
but	it	's	not	one	virus	,	it	's	four	,	and	the	same	 protect 	 ion 	 	that	 give 	 s 	 	you	the	 anti 	 bodies 	 	and	 protect 	 s 	 	you	from	the	same	virus	that	you	had	before	 actual 	 ly 	 	 make 	 s 	 	you	much	more	susceptible	to	the	other	three	.
so	the	next	time	you	get	dengue	 f 	 ever 	 	,	if	it	's	a	different	 s 	 train 	 	,	you	're	more	susceptible	,	you	're	 like 	 ly 	 	to	get	 wo 	 rse 	 	 symptom 	 s 	 	,	and	you	're	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	get	the	more	severe	 form 	 s 	 	,	 hemorrh 	 agic 	 	 f 	 ever 	 	or	shock	syndrome	.
so	you	do	n't	want	dengue	once	,	and	you	 certain 	 ly 	 	do	n't	want	it	 aga 	 in 	 	.
so	why	is	it	 spread 	 ing 	 	so	fast	?
and	the	answer	is	 th 	 is 	 	thing	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	aedes	aegypti	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	mosquito	that	came	,	like	 it 	 s 	 	name	 suggest 	 s 	 	,	out	of	north	africa	,	and	it	's	spread	round	the	world	.
now	,	in	fact	,	a	single	mosquito	will	 on 	 ly 	 	travel	about	200	 yard 	 s 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	entire	life	.	they	do	n't	travel	 ver 	 y 	 	far	.
what	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	good	at	 do 	 ing 	 	is	 hitch 	 hik 	 ing 	 	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	the	 egg 	 s 	 	.
they	will	lay	 the 	 ir 	 	 egg 	 s 	 	in	clear	water	,	any	pool	,	any	 pudd 	 le 	 	,	any	birdbath	,	any	flower	pot	,	 any 	 where 	 	there	's	clear	water	,	they	'll	lay	 the 	 ir 	 	 egg 	 s 	 	,	and	if	that	clear	water	is	near	 fr 	 eight 	 	,	it	's	near	a	port	,	if	it	's	 any 	 where 	 	near	transport	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 egg 	 s 	 	will	then	get	 transport 	 ed 	 	around	the	world	.
and	that	's	what	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	.	 man 	 kind 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 transport 	 ed 	 	these	 egg 	 s 	 	all	the	way	around	the	world	,	and	these	 insect 	 s 	 	have	 in 	 fest 	 ed 	 	over	100	 count 	 ries 	 	,	and	there	's	now	2.5	billion	people	living	in	 count 	 ries 	 	where	 th 	 is 	 	mosquito	 re 	 side 	 s 	 	.
to	give	you	just	a	couple	of	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	how	fast	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	in	the	mid	-	'70s	,	brazil	 declare 	 d 	 	,	``	we	have	no	aedes	aegypti	,	``	and	 current 	 ly 	 	they	 s 	 pend 	 	about	a	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	now	a	year	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	rid	of	it	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	control	it	,	just	one	species	of	mosquito	.
two	 day 	 s 	 	ago	,	or	 yester 	 day 	 	,	i	ca	n't	remember	which	,	i	saw	a	reuters	report	that	 s 	 aid 	 	madeira	had	had	 the 	 ir 	 	first	 case 	 s 	 	of	dengue	,	about	52	 case 	 s 	 	,	with	about	400	 prob 	 able 	 	 case 	 s 	 	.
that	's	two	 day 	 s 	 	ago	.
 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	madeira	first	got	the	insect	in	2005	,	and	here	we	are	,	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	first	 case 	 s 	 	of	dengue	.
so	the	one	thing	you	'll	find	is	that	where	the	mosquito	 go 	 es 	 	,	dengue	will	follow	.
once	you	've	got	the	mosquito	in	your	area	,	 any 	 one 	 	coming	 in 	 to 	 	that	area	with	dengue	,	mosquito	will	bite	them	,	mosquito	will	bite	 some 	 where 	 	else	,	 some 	 where 	 	else	,	 some 	 where 	 	else	,	and	you	'll	get	an	 epi 	 demic 	 	.
so	we	must	be	good	at	 kill 	 ing 	 	 mosquito 	 s 	 	.
i	mean	,	that	ca	n't	be	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	.
well	,	there	's	two	principle	ways	.
the	first	way	is	that	you	use	larvicides	.
you	use	 chemical 	 s 	 	.	you	put	them	 in 	 to 	 	water	where	they	breed	.
now	in	an	urban	environment	,	that	's	 extra 	 ordinari 	 ly 	 	difficult	.
you	've	got	to	get	your	chemical	 in 	 to 	 	every	 pudd 	 le 	 	,	every	birdbath	,	every	tree	trunk	.
it	's	just	not	practical	.
the	second	way	you	can	do	it	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	kill	the	 insect 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	fly	around	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	of	fogging	.
here	what	 some 	 one 	 	is	 do 	 ing 	 	is	 mix 	 ing 	 	up	chemical	in	a	smoke	and	 bas 	 ically 	 	 spread 	 ing 	 	that	through	the	environment	.
you	could	do	the	same	with	a	space	spray	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 un 	 pleas 	 ant 	 	stuff	,	and	if	it	was	any	good	,	we	would	n't	have	 th 	 is 	 	massive	 in 	 crease 	 	in	 mosquito 	 s 	 	and	we	would	n't	have	 th 	 is 	 	massive	 in 	 crease 	 	in	dengue	 f 	 ever 	 	.
so	it	's	not	 ver 	 y 	 	effective	,	but	it	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	best	thing	we	've	got	at	the	moment	.
 hav 	 ing 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	that	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	your	best	form	of	 protect 	 ion 	 	and	my	best	form	of	 protect 	 ion 	 	is	a	long	-	sleeve	shirt	and	a	little	bit	of	deet	to	go	with	it	.
so	let	's	start	 aga 	 in 	 	.	let	's	design	a	product	,	right	from	the	word	go	,	and	decide	what	we	want	.
well	we	 clear 	 ly 	 	need	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	effective	at	 reduc 	 ing 	 	the	mosquito	population	.
there	's	no	point	in	just	 kill 	 ing 	 	the	odd	mosquito	here	and	there	.
we	want	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 get 	 s 	 	that	population	right	the	way	down	so	it	ca	n't	get	the	disease	 trans 	 mission 	 	.
 clear 	 ly 	 	the	product	you	've	got	 ha 	 s 	 	got	to	be	safe	to	 human 	 s 	 	.	we	are	going	to	use	it	in	and	around	 human 	 s 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	safe	.
we	do	n't	want	to	have	a	 last 	 ing 	 	impact	on	the	environment	.
we	do	n't	want	to	do	 any 	 thing 	 	that	you	ca	n't	 un 	 do 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	a	better	product	 come 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	in	20	,	30	 year 	 s 	 	.
fine	.	we	do	n't	want	a	 last 	 ing 	 	 environment 	 al 	 	impact	.
we	want	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	 relat 	 ively 	 	cheap	,	or	cost	-	effective	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	an	awful	lot	of	 count 	 ries 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	,	and	some	of	them	are	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	 market 	 s 	 	,	some	of	them	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	low	-	income	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	you	want	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	species	-	specific	.
you	want	to	get	rid	of	 th 	 is 	 	mosquito	that	 spread 	 s 	 	dengue	,	but	you	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	get	all	the	other	 insect 	 s 	 	.
some	are	 quit 	 e 	 	 benefici 	 al 	 	.	some	are	 import 	 ant 	 	to	your	 eco 	 system 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	one	's	not	.	it	's	 invad 	 ed 	 	you	.
but	you	do	n't	want	to	get	all	of	the	 insect 	 s 	 	.
you	just	want	to	get	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
and	most	of	the	time	,	you	'll	find	 th 	 is 	 	insect	 live 	 s 	 	in	and	around	your	home	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	--	 what 	 ever 	 	we	do	 ha 	 s 	 	got	to	get	to	that	insect	.
it	's	got	to	get	 in 	 to 	 	people	's	 house 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 to 	 	the	 bed 	 rooms 	 	,	 in 	 to 	 	the	 kitchen 	 s 	 	.
now	there	are	two	 feature 	 s 	 	of	mosquito	biology	that	 re 	 ally 	 	help	us	in	 th 	 is 	 	project	,	and	that	is	,	 first 	 ly 	 	,	 male 	 s 	 	do	n't	bite	.
it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	the	female	mosquito	that	will	 actual 	 ly 	 	bite	you	.
the	male	ca	n't	bite	you	,	wo	n't	bite	you	,	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	the	mouth	 part 	 s 	 	to	bite	you	.
it	's	just	the	female	.
and	the	second	is	a	 phenomen 	 on 	 	that	 male 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	good	at	 find 	 ing 	 	 female 	 s 	 	.
if	there	's	a	male	mosquito	that	you	 re 	 lease 	 	,	and	if	there	's	a	female	around	,	that	male	will	find	the	female	.
so	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	we	've	used	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 factor 	 s 	 	.
so	here	's	a	typical	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	male	 meet 	 s 	 	female	,	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 off 	 spring 	 	.
a	single	female	will	lay	about	up	to	100	 egg 	 s 	 	at	a	time	,	up	to	about	500	in	her	 life 	 time 	 	.
now	if	that	male	is	 carry 	 ing 	 	a	gene	which	 cause 	 s 	 	the	death	of	the	 off 	 spring 	 	,	then	the	 off 	 spring 	 	do	n't	 surviv 	 e 	 	,	and	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	500	 mosquito 	 s 	 	running	around	,	you	have	 non 	 e 	 	.
and	if	you	can	put	more	,	i	'll	call	them	 steril 	 e 	 	,	that	the	 off 	 spring 	 	will	 actual 	 ly 	 	die	at	different	 stage 	 s 	 	,	but	i	'll	call	them	 steril 	 e 	 	for	now	.
if	you	put	more	 steril 	 e 	 	 male 	 s 	 	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	environment	,	then	the	 female 	 s 	 	are	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	find	a	 steril 	 e 	 	male	than	a	 fertil 	 e 	 	one	,	and	you	will	 br 	 ing 	 	that	population	down	.
so	the	 male 	 s 	 	will	go	out	,	they	'll	look	for	 female 	 s 	 	,	they	'll	mate	.	if	they	mate	 success 	 fully 	 	,	then	no	 off 	 spring 	 	.
if	they	do	n't	find	a	female	,	then	they	'll	die	 any 	 way 	 	.
they	 on 	 ly 	 	live	a	few	 day 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	where	we	are	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	technology	that	was	 develop 	 ed 	 	in	oxford	university	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
the	company	 it 	 self 	 	,	oxitec	,	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	for	the	last	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	much	on	a	sort	of	similar	 develop 	 ment 	 	 path 	 way 	 	that	you	'd	get	with	a	pharmaceutical	company	.
so	about	10	 year 	 s 	 	of	internal	 evalu 	 ation 	 	,	 test 	 ing 	 	,	to	get	 th 	 is 	 	to	a	state	where	we	think	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	ready	.
and	then	we	've	gone	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	big	 out 	 door 	 s 	 	,	 al 	 ways 	 	with	local	community	consent	,	 al 	 ways 	 	with	the	 necess 	 ary 	 	 permit 	 s 	 	.
so	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	field	 trial 	 s 	 	now	in	the	cayman	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	,	a	small	one	in	malaysia	,	and	two	more	now	in	brazil	.
and	what	's	the	result	?
well	,	the	result	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	good	.
in	about	four	 month 	 s 	 	of	 re 	 lease 	 	,	we	've	 br 	 ought 	 	that	population	of	 mosquito 	 s 	 	--	in	most	 case 	 s 	 	we	're	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	 village 	 s 	 	here	of	about	2,000	,	3,000	people	,	that	sort	of	 s 	 ize 	 	,	 start 	 ing 	 	small	--	we	've	taken	that	mosquito	population	down	by	about	85	percent	in	about	four	 month 	 s 	 	.
and	in	fact	,	the	 number 	 s 	 	after	that	get	,	 t 	 hose 	 	get	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	to	count	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	just	are	n't	any	left	.
so	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	what	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	in	cayman	,	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	what	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	in	brazil	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 trial 	 s 	 	.
and	now	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	is	we	're	going	through	a	process	to	scale	up	to	a	town	of	about	50,000	,	so	we	can	see	 th 	 is 	 	work	at	big	scale	.
and	we	've	got	a	production	unit	in	oxford	,	or	just	south	of	oxford	,	where	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	produce	these	 mosquito 	 s 	 	.
we	can	produce	them	,	in	a	space	a	bit	more	than	 th 	 is 	 	red	carpet	,	i	can	produce	about	20	million	a	week	.
we	can	transport	them	around	the	world	.
it	's	not	 ver 	 y 	 	expensive	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	a	coffee	cup	--	 some 	 thing 	 	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	coffee	cup	will	hold	about	three	million	 egg 	 s 	 	.
so	 fr 	 eight 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	are	n't	our	 big 	 gest 	 	problem	.
so	we	've	got	that	.	you	could	call	it	a	mosquito	 factor 	 y 	 	.
and	for	brazil	,	where	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	some	 trial 	 s 	 	,	the	brazilian	government	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	have	now	built	 the 	 ir 	 	own	mosquito	 factor 	 y 	 	,	far	 big 	 ger 	 	than	 our 	 s 	 	,	and	we	'll	use	that	for	 scal 	 ing 	 	up	in	brazil	.
there	you	are	.	we	've	 s 	 ent 	 	mosquito	 egg 	 s 	 	.
we	've	 separat 	 ed 	 	the	 male 	 s 	 	from	the	 female 	 s 	 	.
the	 male 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	put	in	little	 pot 	 s 	 	and	the	truck	is	going	down	the	road	and	they	are	 re 	 leas 	 ing 	 	 male 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	go	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	little	bit	more	precise	than	that	.
you	want	to	 re 	 lease 	 	them	so	that	you	get	good	 cover 	 age 	 	of	your	area	.
so	you	take	a	google	map	,	you	divide	it	up	,	work	out	how	far	they	can	fly	,	and	make	 s 	 ure 	 	you	're	 re 	 leas 	 ing 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	that	you	get	 cover 	 age 	 	of	the	area	,	and	then	you	go	back	,	and	 with 	 in 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	short	space	of	time	,	you	're	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	that	population	right	the	way	down	.
we	've	 al 	 so 	 	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	 agricultur 	 e 	 	.
we	've	got	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	different	species	of	 agricultur 	 e 	 	coming	 a 	 long 	 	,	and	i	'm	 hop 	 ing 	 	that	soon	we	'll	be	able	to	get	some	 fund 	 ing 	 	together	so	we	can	get	back	and	start	looking	at	malaria	.
so	that	's	where	we	stand	at	the	moment	,	and	i	've	just	got	a	few	final	 thought 	 s 	 	,	which	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	way	in	which	biology	is	now	coming	in	to	supplement	 chemist 	 ry 	 	in	some	of	our	 socie 	 tal 	 	 advance 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	area	,	and	these	 bio 	 logical 	 	 approach 	 es 	 	are	coming	in	in	 ver 	 y 	 	different	 form 	 s 	 	,	and	when	you	think	about	genetic	 engineer 	 ing 	 	,	we	've	now	got	 enzyme 	 s 	 	for	industrial	 process 	 ing 	 	,	 enzyme 	 s 	 	,	 genetic 	 ally 	 	engineered	 enzyme 	 s 	 	in	food	.
we	have	g.m	.	 crop 	 s 	 	,	we	have	 pharmaceutical 	 s 	 	,	we	have	new	 vaccin 	 es 	 	,	all	using	 rough 	 ly 	 	the	same	technology	,	but	with	 ver 	 y 	 	different	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'm	in	favor	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	.	of	course	i	am	.
i	'm	in	favor	of	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	where	the	 old 	 er 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	do	n't	work	well	or	have	 be 	 come 	 	 un 	 accept 	 able 	 	.
and	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	the	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	are	similar	,	the	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	different	,	and	if	you	take	our	approach	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	and	you	 compar 	 e 	 	it	to	,	say	,	g.m	.	 crop 	 s 	 	,	both	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	produce	a	massive	benefit	.
both	have	a	side	benefit	,	which	is	that	we	 reduc 	 e 	 	 pest 	 icide 	 	use	 tremendous 	 ly 	 	.
but	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	a	g.m	.	crop	is	 try 	 ing 	 	to	protect	the	plant	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	and	give	it	an	advantage	,	what	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	is	taking	the	mosquito	and	giving	it	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 dis 	 advantage 	 	it	can	possibly	have	,	 render 	 ing 	 	it	 un 	 able 	 	to	 re 	 produce 	 	 effective 	 ly 	 	.
so	for	the	mosquito	,	it	's	a	dead	end	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
