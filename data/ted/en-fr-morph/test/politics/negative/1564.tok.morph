it	's	time	to	start	 design 	 ing 	 	for	our	 ear 	 s 	 	.
 architect 	 s 	 	and	 design 	 ers 	 	tend	to	focus	 exclusive 	 ly 	 	on	these	.
they	use	these	to	design	with	and	they	design	for	them	,	which	is	why	we	end	up	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	 restaurant 	 s 	 	that	look	like	 th 	 is 	 	--	--	and	sound	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	 shout 	 ing 	 	from	a	foot	away	to	try	and	be	heard	by	our	 d 	 inner 	 	companion	,	or	why	we	get	on	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	--	--	which	cost	200	million	 pound 	 s 	 	,	with	 some 	 body 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	through	an	old	-	 fashion 	 ed 	 	 tele 	 phone 	 	 hand 	 set 	 	on	a	cheap	stereo	system	,	making	us	jump	out	of	our	 skin 	 s 	 	.
we	're	 design 	 ing 	 	 environment 	 s 	 	that	make	us	crazy	.
and	it	's	not	just	our	quality	of	life	which	 suffer 	 s 	 	.
it	's	our	health	,	our	social	behavior	,	and	our	 product 	 ivity 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
how	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	work	?	well	,	two	ways	.
first	of	all	,	 ambi 	 ence 	 	.	i	have	a	whole	tedtalk	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
sound	 affect 	 s 	 	us	 physiologic 	 ally 	 	,	 psycho 	 logically 	 	,	 cognitive 	 ly 	 	and	 behavior 	 ally 	 	all	the	time	.
the	sound	around	us	is	 affect 	 ing 	 	us	even	 th 	 ough 	 	we	're	not	conscious	of	it	.
there	's	a	second	way	 th 	 ough 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
that	's	 inter 	 ference 	 	.	communication	 requir 	 es 	 	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	and	 receiv 	 ing 	 	,	and	i	have	 an 	 other 	 	whole	tedtalk	about	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	conscious	 listen 	 ing 	 	,	but	i	can	 s 	 end 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	i	like	,	and	you	can	be	 brilli 	 ant 	 	conscious	 listen 	 ers 	 	.
if	the	space	i	'm	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	it	in	is	not	effective	,	that	communication	ca	n't	happen	.
 space 	 s 	 	tend	to	include	noise	and	 acoustic 	 s 	 	.
a	room	like	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 acoustic 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	one	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 acoustic 	 s 	 	.
 man 	 y 	 	rooms	are	not	so	good	.
let	me	give	you	some	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	from	a	couple	of	 area 	 s 	 	which	i	think	we	all	care	about	:	health	and	education	.	when	i	was	 visit 	 ing 	 	my	 terminal 	 ly 	 	ill	father	in	a	hospital	,	i	was	 ask 	 ing 	 	 my 	 self 	 	,	how	 do 	 es 	 	 any 	 body 	 	get	well	in	a	place	that	 sound 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	?
hospital	sound	is	 get 	 ting 	 	 wo 	 rse 	 	all	the	time	.
noise	 level 	 s 	 	in	 hospital 	 s 	 	have	 double 	 d 	 	in	the	last	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 affect 	 s 	 	not	just	the	 patient 	 s 	 	but	 al 	 so 	 	the	people	 work 	 ing 	 	there	.
i	think	we	would	like	for	 dispens 	 ing 	 	 error 	 s 	 	to	be	zero	,	would	n't	we	?	and	yet	,	 a 	 s 	 	noise	 level 	 s 	 	go	up	,	so	do	the	 error 	 s 	 	in	 dispens 	 ing 	 	made	by	the	staff	in	 hospital 	 s 	 	.
most	of	all	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	it	 affect 	 s 	 	the	 patient 	 s 	 	,	and	that	could	be	you	,	it	could	be	me	.
sleep	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 cruci 	 al 	 	for	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	.
it	's	when	we	 re 	 generate 	 	,	when	we	 re 	 build 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	and	with	 threaten 	 ing 	 	noise	like	 th 	 is 	 	going	on	,	your	body	,	even	if	you	are	able	to	sleep	,	your	body	is	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	,	``	i	'm	under	threat	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 danger 	 ous 	 	.	``	and	the	quality	of	sleep	is	 de 	 grad 	 ed 	 	,	and	so	is	our	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	.
there	are	just	huge	 benefit 	 s 	 	to	come	from	 design 	 ing 	 	for	the	 ear 	 s 	 	in	our	health	care	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	area	i	intend	to	take	on	 th 	 is 	 	year	.
education	.
when	i	see	a	 class 	 room 	 	that	 look 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	can	you	imagine	how	 th 	 is 	 	 sound 	 s 	 	?
i	am	 force 	 d 	 	to	ask	 my 	 self 	 	a	question	.
now	,	that	's	a	little	 un 	 fair 	 	.	some	of	my	best	 friend 	 s 	 	are	 architect 	 s 	 	.	and	they	 definite 	 ly 	 	do	have	 ear 	 s 	 	.
but	i	think	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	they	do	n't	use	them	when	they	're	 design 	 ing 	 	 building 	 s 	 	.	here	's	a	case	in	point	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	32	-	million	-	pound	 flag 	 ship 	 	academy	school	which	was	built	 quit 	 e 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	in	the	u.k.	and	designed	by	one	of	britain	's	top	 architect 	 s 	 	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	it	was	designed	like	a	corporate	 head 	 quarter 	 s 	 	,	with	a	vast	central	 at 	 rium 	 	and	 class 	 rooms 	 	 lead 	 ing 	 	off	it	with	no	back	 wall 	 s 	 	at	all	.
the	children	could	n't	hear	 the 	 ir 	 	 teacher 	 s 	 	.
they	had	to	go	back	in	and	 s 	 pend 	 	600,000	 pound 	 s 	 	 put 	 ting 	 	the	 wall 	 s 	 	in	.	let	's	stop	 th 	 is 	 	 mad 	 ness 	 	of	open	plan	 class 	 rooms 	 	right	now	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	.
it	's	not	just	these	modern	 building 	 s 	 	which	suffer	.
old	-	 fashion 	 ed 	 	 class 	 rooms 	 	suffer	too	.
a	 stud 	 y 	 	in	florida	just	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	found	that	if	you	're	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	where	 th 	 is 	 	photograph	was	taken	in	the	 class 	 room 	 	,	row	four	,	speech	 intellig 	 ibility 	 	is	just	50	percent	.
children	are	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	one	word	in	two	.
now	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	they	 on 	 ly 	 	get	half	 the 	 ir 	 	education	,	but	it	 do 	 es 	 	mean	they	have	to	work	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	join	the	 dot 	 s 	 	and	understand	what	's	going	on	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 affect 	 ed 	 	 massive 	 ly 	 	by	 reverbe 	 ration 	 	time	,	how	 reverbe 	 rant 	 	a	room	is	.
in	a	 class 	 room 	 	with	a	 reverbe 	 ration 	 	time	of	1.2	 second 	 s 	 	,	which	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	common	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	 sound 	 s 	 	like	.
not	so	good	,	is	it	?
if	you	take	that	1.2	 second 	 s 	 	down	to	0.4	 second 	 s 	 	by	 install 	 ing 	 	acoustic	 treat 	 ments 	 	,	sound	 absorb 	 ing 	 	 material 	 s 	 	and	so	forth	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	you	get	.
voice	:	in	language	,	 infinite 	 ly 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 word 	 s 	 	can	be	written	with	a	small	set	of	 letter 	 s 	 	.	in	arithmetic	,	 infinite 	 ly 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 number 	 s 	 	can	be	 compose 	 d 	 	from	just	a	few	 digit 	 s 	 	with	the	help	of	the	simple	zero	.
julian	 treasu 	 re 	 	:	what	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
now	that	education	you	would	 receiv 	 e 	 	,	and	 thank 	 s 	 	to	the	british	 acoustic 	 ian 	 	adrian	james	for	 t 	 hose 	 	 simul 	 ations 	 	.	the	signal	was	the	same	,	the	 back 	 ground 	 	noise	was	the	same	.
all	that	 change 	 d 	 	was	the	 acoustic 	 s 	 	of	the	 class 	 room 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
if	education	can	be	 like 	 ned 	 	to	 water 	 ing 	 	a	garden	,	which	is	a	fair	metaphor	,	 s 	 ad 	 ly 	 	,	much	of	the	water	is	 evapo 	 rating 	 	before	it	 reach 	 es 	 	the	 flower 	 s 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	for	some	 group 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	with	 hear 	 ing 	 	 impair 	 ment 	 	.
now	that	's	not	just	deaf	children	.	that	could	be	any	child	who	's	got	a	cold	,	glue	ear	,	an	ear	 infect 	 ion 	 	,	even	hay	 f 	 ever 	 	.	on	a	 give 	 n 	 	day	,	one	in	eight	children	fall	 in 	 to 	 	that	group	,	on	any	 give 	 n 	 	day	.
then	you	have	children	for	whom	english	is	a	second	language	,	or	 what 	 ever 	 	they	're	 be 	 ing 	 	taught	in	is	a	second	language	.
in	the	u.k.	,	that	's	more	than	10	percent	of	the	school	population	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	after	susan	cain	's	 wonder 	 ful 	 	tedtalk	in	february	,	we	know	that	 introvert 	 s 	 	find	it	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	to	 re 	 late 	 	when	they	're	in	a	noisy	environment	 do 	 ing 	 	group	work	.
add	 t 	 hose 	 	up	.	that	is	a	lot	of	children	who	are	not	 receiv 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	education	 proper 	 ly 	 	.
it	's	not	just	the	children	who	are	 affect 	 ed 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	in	germany	found	the	average	noise	level	in	 class 	 rooms 	 	is	65	 decibel 	 s 	 	.
i	have	to	 re 	 ally 	 	raise	my	voice	to	talk	over	65	 decibel 	 s 	 	of	sound	,	and	 teacher 	 s 	 	are	not	just	raising	 the 	 ir 	 	 voice 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	chart	 map 	 s 	 	the	teacher	's	heart	rate	against	the	noise	level	.
noise	 go 	 es 	 	up	,	heart	rate	 go 	 es 	 	up	.
that	is	not	good	for	you	.
in	fact	,	65	 decibel 	 s 	 	is	the	 ver 	 y 	 	level	at	which	 th 	 is 	 	big	survey	of	all	the	evidence	on	noise	and	health	found	that	,	that	is	the	threshold	for	the	danger	of	 myo 	 car 	 dial 	 	 in 	 far 	 ction 	 	.
to	you	and	me	,	that	's	a	heart	attack	.
it	may	not	be	 push 	 ing 	 	the	boat	out	too	far	to	suggest	that	 man 	 y 	 	 teacher 	 s 	 	are	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	significant	life	 expect 	 ancy 	 	by	 teach 	 ing 	 	in	 environment 	 s 	 	like	that	day	after	day	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	it	cost	to	treat	a	 class 	 room 	 	down	to	that	0.4	-	second	 reverbe 	 ration 	 	time	?
two	and	a	half	thousand	 pound 	 s 	 	.
and	the	essex	 stud 	 y 	 	which	 ha 	 s 	 	just	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	in	the	u.k.	,	which	 incident 	 ally 	 	 show 	 ed 	 	that	when	you	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	do	not	just	make	a	room	that	's	 suit 	 able 	 	for	 hear 	 ing 	 	-	 impair 	 ed 	 	children	,	you	make	a	room	where	behavior	 improve 	 s 	 	,	and	 result 	 s 	 	improve	 significant 	 ly 	 	,
 th 	 is 	 	found	that	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	a	child	out	of	area	to	a	school	that	 do 	 es 	 	have	 s 	 uch 	 	a	room	,	if	you	do	n't	have	one	,	 cost 	 s 	 	90,000	 pound 	 s 	 	a	year	.
i	think	the	 economic 	 s 	 	are	 pre 	 tty 	 	clear	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	'm	glad	that	debate	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	just	 moderate 	 d 	 	a	major	 con 	 ference 	 	in	london	a	few	 week 	 s 	 	ago	 call 	 ed 	 	sound	education	,	which	 br 	 ought 	 	together	top	 acoustic 	 ians 	 	,	government	people	,	 teacher 	 s 	 	,	and	so	forth	.
we	're	at	last	 start 	 ing 	 	to	debate	 th 	 is 	 	issue	,	and	the	 benefit 	 s 	 	that	are	 avail 	 able 	 	for	 design 	 ing 	 	for	the	 ear 	 s 	 	in	education	,	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	.
out	of	that	 con 	 ference 	 	,	 incident 	 ally 	 	,	 al 	 so 	 	came	a	free	app	which	is	designed	to	help	children	 stud 	 y 	 	if	they	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	work	at	home	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	in	a	noisy	kitchen	.
and	that	's	free	out	of	that	 con 	 ference 	 	.
let	's	 broad 	 en 	 	the	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	a	little	bit	and	look	at	cities	.
we	have	urban	 plan 	 ner 	 s 	 	.
where	are	the	urban	sound	 plan 	 ner 	 s 	 	?
i	do	n't	know	of	one	in	the	world	,	and	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	is	there	to	transform	our	experience	in	our	cities	.
the	world	health	 organ 	 ization 	 	 estimate 	 s 	 	that	a	quarter	of	europe	's	population	is	 hav 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	sleep	 de 	 grad 	 ed 	 	by	noise	in	cities	.	we	can	do	better	than	that	.
and	in	our	 off 	 ice 	 s 	 	,	we	 s 	 pend 	 	a	lot	of	time	at	work	.
where	are	the	 off 	 ice 	 	sound	 plan 	 ner 	 s 	 	?
people	who	say	,	do	n't	 s 	 it 	 	that	team	next	to	 th 	 is 	 	team	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	like	noise	and	they	need	quiet	.
or	who	say	,	do	n't	 s 	 pend 	 	all	your	budget	on	a	huge	screen	in	the	 con 	 ference 	 	room	,	and	then	place	one	 tin 	 y 	 	 micro 	 phone 	 	in	the	middle	of	a	table	for	30	people	.
if	you	can	hear	me	,	you	can	understand	me	 with 	 out 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	me	.	if	you	can	see	me	 with 	 out 	 	 hear 	 ing 	 	me	,	that	 do 	 es 	 	not	work	.
so	 off 	 ice 	 	sound	is	a	huge	area	,	and	 incident 	 ally 	 	,	noise	in	 off 	 ice 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 show 	 n 	 	to	make	people	less	 help 	 ful 	 	,	less	enjoy	 the 	 ir 	 	 team 	 work 	 	,	and	less	productive	at	work	.
 final 	 ly 	 	,	we	have	 home 	 s 	 	.	we	use	 in 	 terior 	 	 design 	 ers 	 	.
where	are	the	 in 	 terior 	 	sound	 design 	 ers 	 	?
 he 	 y 	 	,	let	's	all	be	 in 	 terior 	 	sound	 design 	 ers 	 	,	take	on	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	our	rooms	and	 design 	 ing 	 	sound	that	's	effective	and	appropriate	.
my	friend	richard	mazuch	,	an	architect	in	london	,	 co 	 in 	 ed 	 	the	phrase	``	 in 	 visible 	 	 architect 	 ure 	 	.	``
i	love	that	phrase	.
it	's	about	 design 	 ing 	 	,	not	 appear 	 ance 	 	,	but	experience	,	so	that	we	have	 space 	 s 	 	that	sound	 a 	 s 	 	good	 a 	 s 	 	they	look	,	that	are	fit	for	purpose	,	that	improve	our	quality	of	life	,	our	health	and	well	 be 	 ing 	 	,	our	social	behavior	and	our	 product 	 ivity 	 	.
it	's	time	to	start	 design 	 ing 	 	for	the	 ear 	 s 	 	.
thank	you	.
