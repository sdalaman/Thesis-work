the	job	of	 un 	 cover 	 ing 	 	the	global	food	waste	scandal	 start 	 ed 	 	for	me	when	i	was	15	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
i	 b 	 ought 	 	some	 pig 	 s 	 	.	i	was	living	in	sussex	.
and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	feed	them	in	the	most	 tradition 	 al 	 	and	 environment 	 ally 	 	friendly	way	.
i	went	to	my	school	kitchen	,	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	give	me	the	 scrap 	 s 	 	that	my	school	 friend 	 s 	 	have	 turn 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 nose 	 s 	 	up	at	.	``	i	went	to	the	local	 bake 	 r 	 	and	took	 the 	 ir 	 	 s 	 tale 	 	bread	.
i	went	to	the	local	greengrocer	,	and	i	went	to	a	 farm 	 er 	 	who	was	 throw 	 ing 	 	away	 potato 	 es 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	the	wrong	shape	or	 s 	 ize 	 	for	 super 	 market 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	great	.	my	 pig 	 s 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	that	food	waste	 in 	 to 	 	 delic 	 ious 	 	pork	.	i	 s 	 old 	 	that	pork	to	my	school	 friend 	 s 	 	'	 parent 	 s 	 	,	and	i	made	a	good	pocket	money	 add 	 ition 	 	to	my	 teen 	 age 	 	 allow 	 ance 	 	.
but	i	 notice 	 d 	 	that	most	of	the	food	that	i	was	giving	my	 pig 	 s 	 	was	in	fact	fit	for	human	consumption	,	and	that	i	was	 on 	 ly 	 	 scratch 	 ing 	 	the	surface	,	and	that	right	the	way	up	the	food	supply	chain	,	in	 super 	 market 	 s 	 	,	greengrocers	,	 bake 	 rs 	 	,	in	our	 home 	 s 	 	,	in	 factor 	 ies 	 	and	 farm 	 s 	 	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 hemorrh 	 aging 	 	out	food	.
 super 	 market 	 s 	 	did	n't	even	want	to	talk	to	me	about	how	much	food	they	 we 	 re 	 	 was 	 ting 	 	.
i	'd	 be 	 en 	 	round	the	back	.	i	'd	 s 	 een 	 	 bin 	 s 	 	full	of	food	 be 	 ing 	 	 lock 	 ed 	 	and	then	 truck 	 ed 	 	off	to	 land 	 fill 	 	 s 	 ites 	 	,	and	i	thought	,	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	more	 sens 	 ible 	 	to	do	with	food	than	waste	it	.
one	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	when	i	was	 feed 	 ing 	 	my	 pig 	 s 	 	,	i	 notice 	 d 	 	a	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	tasty	-	looking	 s 	 un 	 	-	dried	tomato	loaf	that	used	to	crop	up	from	time	to	time	.
i	 grab 	 bed 	 	hold	of	it	,	 s 	 at 	 	down	,	and	ate	my	 break 	 fast 	 	with	my	 pig 	 s 	 	.
that	was	the	first	act	of	what	i	 lat 	 er 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	to	call	freeganism	,	 re 	 ally 	 	an	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	of	the	 in 	 justice 	 	of	food	waste	,	and	the	 pro 	 vision 	 	of	the	solution	to	food	waste	,	which	is	 simpl 	 y 	 	to	 s 	 it 	 	down	and	eat	food	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 throw 	 ing 	 	it	away	.
that	 be 	 came 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 we 	 re 	 	,	a	way	of	 confront 	 ing 	 	large	 business 	 es 	 	in	the	business	of	 was 	 ting 	 	food	,	and	 ex 	 posing 	 	,	most	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	to	the	public	,	that	when	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	food	 be 	 ing 	 	 throw 	 n 	 	away	,	we	're	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 rot 	 ten 	 	stuff	,	we	're	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	stuff	that	's	beyond	the	pale	.
we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	good	,	fresh	food	that	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 waste 	 d 	 	on	a	colossal	scale	.
 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	i	set	about	writing	my	book	,	 re 	 ally 	 	to	 demonst 	 rate 	 	the	 ex 	 tent 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	problem
on	a	global	scale	.	what	 th 	 is 	 	 show 	 s 	 	is	a	nation	-	by	-	nation	 break 	 down 	 	of	the	 like 	 ly 	 	level	of	food	waste	in	each	country	in	the	world	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	 empir 	 ical 	 	data	,	good	,	hard	 stat 	 s 	 	,	do	n't	exist	,
and	 there 	 fore 	 	to	prove	my	point	,	i	first	of	all	had	to	find	some	 pr 	 oxy 	 	way	of	 un 	 cover 	 ing 	 	how	much	food	was	 be 	 ing 	 	 waste 	 d 	 	.
so	i	took	the	food	supply	of	every	single	country	and	i	 compar 	 ed 	 	it	to	what	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 like 	 ly 	 	to	be	 be 	 ing 	 	 consum 	 ed 	 	in	each	country	.
that	's	based	on	diet	 in 	 take 	 	 survey 	 s 	 	,	it	's	based	on	 level 	 s 	 	of	 obes 	 ity 	 	,	it	's	based	on	a	range	of	 factor 	 s 	 	that	 give 	 s 	 	you	an	approximate	guess	 a 	 s 	 	to	how	much	food	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	 in 	 to 	 	people	's	 mouth 	 s 	 	.
that	black	line	in	the	middle	of	that	table	is	the	 like 	 ly 	 	level	of	consumption	with	an	 allow 	 ance 	 	for	certain	 level 	 s 	 	of	 inevit 	 able 	 	waste	.
there	will	 al 	 ways 	 	be	waste	.	i	'm	not	that	 un 	 realistic 	 	that	i	think	we	can	live	in	a	waste	-	free	world	.
but	that	black	line	 show 	 s 	 	what	a	food	supply	should	be	in	a	country	if	they	allow	for	a	good	,	 s 	 table 	 	,	secure	,	 nutrition 	 al 	 	diet	for	every	person	in	that	country	.
any	dot	above	that	line	,	and	you	'll	 quick 	 ly 	 	notice	that	that	 include 	 s 	 	most	 count 	 ries 	 	in	the	world	,	 represent 	 s 	 	 un 	 necess 	 ary 	 	 sur 	 plus 	 	,	and	is	 like 	 ly 	 	to	reflect	 level 	 s 	 	of	waste	in	each	country	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	country	 get 	 s 	 	 rich 	 er 	 	,	it	 invest 	 s 	 	more	and	more	in	 get 	 ting 	 	more	and	more	 sur 	 plus 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 shop 	 s 	 	and	 restaurant 	 s 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	most	european	and	north	american	 count 	 ries 	 	fall	between	150	and	200	percent	of	the	 nutrition 	 al 	 	 requir 	 ement 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 population 	 s 	 	.
so	a	country	like	america	 ha 	 s 	 	twice	 a 	 s 	 	much	food	on	 it 	 s 	 	shop	 shelv 	 es 	 	and	in	 it 	 s 	 	 restaurant 	 s 	 	than	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 requir 	 ed 	 	to	feed	the	american	people	.
but	the	thing	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 truck 	 	me	,	when	i	 plot 	 ted 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	data	,	and	it	was	a	lot	of	 number 	 s 	 	,	was	that	you	can	see	how	it	 level 	 s 	 	off	.
 count 	 ries 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	shoot	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	that	150	mark	,	and	then	they	level	off	,	and	they	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	go	on	 ris 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	might	expect	.
so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	 un 	 pack 	 	that	data	a	little	bit	further	to	see	if	that	was	true	or	false	.
and	that	's	what	i	came	up	with	.
if	you	include	not	just	the	food	that	 end 	 s 	 	up	in	 shop 	 s 	 	and	 restaurant 	 s 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	the	food	that	people	feed	to	 live 	 stock 	 	,	the	 ma 	 ize 	 	,	the	 so 	 y 	 	,	the	wheat	,	that	 human 	 s 	 	could	eat	but	 choos 	 e 	 	to	 fat 	 ten 	 	 live 	 stock 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	to	produce	increasing	 amount 	 s 	 	of	meat	and	 dai 	 ry 	 	 product 	 s 	 	,	what	you	find	is	that	most	rich	 count 	 ries 	 	have	between	three	and	four	 time 	 s 	 	the	amount	of	food	that	 the 	 ir 	 	population	 need 	 s 	 	to	feed	 it 	 self 	 	.
a	country	like	america	 ha 	 s 	 	four	 time 	 s 	 	the	amount	of	food	that	it	 need 	 s 	 	.
when	people	talk	about	the	need	to	 in 	 crease 	 	global	food	production	to	feed	 t 	 hose 	 	nine	billion	people	that	are	 expect 	 ed 	 	on	the	planet	by	2050	,	i	 al 	 ways 	 	think	of	these	 graph 	 s 	 	.
the	fact	is	,	we	have	an	enormous	 buff 	 er 	 	in	rich	 count 	 ries 	 	between	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	 hung 	 er 	 	.
we	've	never	had	 s 	 uch 	 	 gar 	 gantuan 	 	 sur 	 plus 	 es 	 	before	.
in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	great	success	story	of	human	 civil 	 ization 	 	,	of	the	 agricultur 	 al 	 	 sur 	 plus 	 es 	 	that	we	set	out	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	12,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
it	is	a	success	story	.	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	success	story	.
but	what	we	have	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	now	is	that	we	are	 reach 	 ing 	 	the	 eco 	 logical 	 	 limit 	 s 	 	that	our	planet	can	bear	,	and	when	we	chop	down	 forest 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	are	every	day	,	to	grow	more	and	more	food	,	when	we	 ex 	 tract 	 	water	from	 deple 	 ting 	 	water	 re 	 serve 	 s 	 	,	when	we	emit	fossil	fuel	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	in	the	quest	to	grow	more	and	more	food	,	and	then	we	throw	away	so	much	of	it	,	we	have	to	think	about	what	we	can	start	saving	.
and	 yester 	 day 	 	,	i	went	to	one	of	the	local	 super 	 market 	 s 	 	that	i	often	visit	to	inspect	,	if	you	like	,	what	they	're	 throw 	 ing 	 	away	.
i	found	 quit 	 e 	 	a	few	 pack 	 et 	 s 	 	of	biscuits	 among 	 st 	 	all	the	fruit	and	 veget 	 able 	 s 	 	and	 every 	 thing 	 	else	that	was	in	there	.
and	i	thought	,	well	 th 	 is 	 	could	serve	 a 	 s 	 	a	symbol	for	 to 	 day 	 	.
so	i	want	you	to	imagine	that	these	nine	biscuits	that	i	found	in	the	bin	represent	the	global	food	supply	,
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?	we	start	out	with	nine	.
that	's	what	's	in	 field 	 s 	 	around	the	world	every	single	year	.
the	first	biscuit	we	're	going	to	lose	before	we	even	 leav 	 e 	 	the	farm	.
that	's	a	problem	 prim 	 arily 	 	 associate 	 d 	 	with	 develop 	 ing 	 	work	 agricultur 	 e 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	a	lack	of	 infra 	 structure 	 	,	 refrige 	 ration 	 	,	pasteurization	,	grain	 store 	 s 	 	,	even	 bas 	 ic 	 	fruit	crates	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 
that	food	 go 	 es 	 	to	waste	before	it	even	 leav 	 es 	 	the	 field 	 s 	 	.
the	next	three	biscuits	are	the	 food 	 s 	 	that	we	decide	to	feed	to	 live 	 stock 	 	,	the	 ma 	 ize 	 	,	the	wheat	and	the	soya	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	our	 beast 	 s 	 	are	 in 	 efficient 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	,	and	they	turn	two	-	 third 	 s 	 	of	that	 in 	 to 	 	 fec 	 es 	 	and	heat	,
so	we	've	lost	 t 	 hose 	 	two	,	and	we	've	 on 	 ly 	 	 ke 	 pt 	 	 th 	 is 	 	one	in	meat	and	 dai 	 ry 	 	 product 	 s 	 	.
two	more	we	're	going	to	throw	away	 direct 	 ly 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 bin 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	most	of	us	think	of	when	we	think	of	food	waste	,	what	 end 	 s 	 	up	in	the	garbage	,	what	 end 	 s 	 	up	in	 super 	 market 	 	 bin 	 s 	 	,	what	 end 	 s 	 	up	in	restaurant	 bin 	 s 	 	.	we	've	lost	 an 	 other 	 	two	,	and	we	've	left	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	with	just	four	biscuits	to	feed	on	.
that	is	not	a	superlatively	efficient	use	of	global	 resource 	 s 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	when	you	think	of	the	billion	 hung 	 ry 	 	people	that	exist	 al 	 ready 	 	in	the	world	.
 hav 	 ing 	 	gone	through	the	data	,	i	then	 need 	 ed 	 	to	 demonst 	 rate 	 	where	that	food	 end 	 s 	 	up	.
where	 do 	 es 	 	it	end	up	?	we	're	used	to	 see 	 ing 	 	the	stuff
on	our	 plate 	 s 	 	,	but	what	about	all	the	stuff	that	 go 	 es 	 	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	in	between	?
 super 	 market 	 s 	 	are	an	easy	place	to	start	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	result	of	my	hobby	,	which	is	 un 	 official 	 	bin	inspections	.
strange	you	might	think	,	but	if	we	could	 re 	 ly 	 	on	 corporation 	 s 	 	to	tell	us	what	they	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	in	the	back	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 store 	 s 	 	,	we	would	n't	need	to	go	 sneak 	 ing 	 	around	the	back	,	 open 	 ing 	 	up	 bin 	 s 	 	and	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	look	at	what	's	 in 	 side 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	you	can	see	more	or	less	on	every	street	corner	in	britain	,	in	europe	,	in	north	america	.
it	 represent 	 s 	 	a	colossal	waste	of	food	,	but	what	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	whilst	i	was	writing	my	book	was	that	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	evident	abundance	of	waste	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	tip	of	the	 ice 	 berg 	 	.
when	you	start	going	up	the	supply	chain	,	you	find	where	the	real	food	waste	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	on	a	 gar 	 gantuan 	 	scale	.
can	i	have	a	show	of	 hand 	 s 	 	if	you	have	a	loaf	of	 slice 	 d 	 	bread	in	your	house	?
who	 live 	 s 	 	in	a	 house 	 hold 	 	where	that	crust	--	that	slice	at	the	first	and	last	end	of	each	loaf	--	who	 live 	 s 	 	in	a	 house 	 hold 	 	where	it	 do 	 es 	 	get	eaten	?
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	most	people	,	not	 every 	 one 	 	,	but	most	people	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	i	'm	glad	to	say	,	what	i	see	 a 	 cross 	 	the	world	,
and	yet	 ha 	 s 	 	 any 	 one 	 	 s 	 een 	 	a	 super 	 market 	 	or	sandwich	shop	 any 	 where 	 	in	the	world	that	 serve 	 s 	 	 sandwich 	 es 	 	with	 crust 	 s 	 	on	it	?
i	 certain 	 ly 	 	have	n't	.
so	i	 ke 	 pt 	 	on	 think 	 ing 	 	,	where	do	 t 	 hose 	 	 crust 	 s 	 	go	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	answer	,	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	:	13,000	 slice 	 s 	 	of	fresh	bread	coming	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	one	single	 factor 	 y 	 	every	single	day	,	day	-	fresh	bread	.
in	the	same	year	that	i	 visit 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 factor 	 y 	 	,	i	went	to	pakistan	,	where	people	in	2008	 we 	 re 	 	going	 hung 	 ry 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	a	 squeez 	 e 	 	on	global	food	 suppli 	 es 	 	.
we	 con 	 tribute 	 	to	that	 squeez 	 e 	 	by	 deposit 	 ing 	 	food	in	 bin 	 s 	 	here	in	britain	and	 else 	 where 	 	in	the	world	.	we	take	food

go	one	step	up	,	and	you	get	to	 farm 	 ers 	 	,	who	throw	away	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	a	third	or	even	more	of	 the 	 ir 	 	harvest	 be 	 cause 	 	of	cosmetic	 standard 	 s 	 	.

the	one	in	the	middle	,	on	my	kitchen	table	.	not	much	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
the	one	on	the	right	i	 treat 	 ed 	 	like	cut	 flower 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	living	organism	,	cut	the	slice	off	,	 s 	 tuck 	 	it	in	a	vase	of	water	,	it	was	all	right	for	 an 	 other 	 	two	 week 	 s 	 	after	 th 	 is 	 	.
some	food	waste	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	will	 inevit 	 ably 	 	arise	,	so	the	question	is	,	what	is	the	best	thing	to	do	with	it	?
i	 answer 	 ed 	 	that	question	when	i	was	15	.
in	fact	,	 human 	 s 	 	 answer 	 ed 	 	that	question	6,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	:	we	 domestic 	 ated 	 	 pig 	 s 	 	to	turn	food	waste	back	 in 	 to 	 	food	.
and	yet	,	in	europe	,	that	practice	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 il 	 legal 	 	since	2001	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	the	foot	-	and	-	mouth	 out 	 break 	 	.
it	's	 un 	 scientific 	 	.	it	's	 un 	 necess 	 ary 	 	.
if	you	cook	food	for	 pig 	 s 	 	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	if	you	cook	food	for	 human 	 s 	 	,	it	is	 render 	 ed 	 	safe	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	massive	saving	of	 resource 	 s 	 	.
at	the	moment	,	europe	 depend 	 s 	 	on	 import 	 ing 	 	 million 	 s 	 	of	 ton 	 s 	 	of	 so 	 y 	 	from	south	america	,	where	 it 	 s 	 	production	 con 	 tribute 	 s 	 	to	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	,	to	 de 	 forest 	 ation 	 	,	to	 bio 	 divers 	 ity 	 	loss	,	to	feed	 live 	 stock 	 	here	in	europe	.
at	the	same	time	we	throw	away	 million 	 s 	 	of	 ton 	 s 	 	of	food	waste	which	we	could	and	should	be	 feed 	 ing 	 	them	.
if	we	did	that	,	and	fed	it	to	 pig 	 s 	 	,	we	would	 s 	 ave 	 	that	amount	of	carbon	.
if	we	feed	our	food	waste	which	is	the	current	government	 favor 	 ite 	 	way	of	 get 	 ting 	 	rid	of	food	waste	,	to	anaerobic	 digest 	 ion 	 	,	which	 turn 	 s 	 	food	waste	 in 	 to 	 	gas	to	produce	 electric 	 ity 	 	,	you	 s 	 ave 	 	a	 pal 	 try 	 	448	 kilo 	 gram 	 s 	 	of	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	per	ton	of	food	waste	.	it	's	much	better	to	feed	it	to	 pig 	 s 	 	.
we	 k 	 new 	 	that	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	war	.
a	silver	lining	:	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 kick 	 ed 	 	off	 global 	 ly 	 	,	the	quest	to	tackle	food	waste	.
 feed 	 ing 	 	the	5,000	is	an	event	i	first	 organize 	 d 	 	in	2009	.
we	fed	5,000	people	all	on	food	that	 other 	 wise 	 	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	 waste 	 d 	 	.
since	then	,	it	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	in	london	,	it	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	 inter 	 national 	 ly 	 	,	and	 a 	 cross 	 	the	country	.
it	's	a	way	of	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	coming	together	to	 celebr 	 ate 	 	food	,	to	say	the	best	thing	to	do	with	food	is	to	eat	and	enjoy	it	,	and	to	stop	 was 	 ting 	 	it	.
for	the	sake	of	the	planet	we	live	on	,	for	the	sake	of	our	children	,	for	the	sake	of	all	the	other	 organism 	 s 	 	that	share	our	planet	with	us	,	we	are	a	terrestrial	animal	,	and	we	depend	on	our	land
for	food	.	at	the	moment	,	we	are	 trash 	 ing 	 	our	land	to	grow	food	that	no	one	eats	.
stop	 was 	 ting 	 	food	.	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
