when	i	was	14	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	i	had	low	self	-	esteem	.
i	felt	i	was	not	 talent 	 ed 	 	at	 any 	 thing 	 	.
one	day	,	i	 b 	 ought 	 	a	yo	-	yo	.
when	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	my	first	trick	,	it	 look 	 ed 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.	i	could	n't	even	do	the	 simpl 	 est 	 	trick	,
but	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	natural	for	me	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	not	 d 	 extr 	 ous 	 	,	and	 hat 	 ed 	 	all	 s 	 port 	 s 	 	.
but	after	one	week	of	 p 	 rac 	 tic 	 ing 	 	,	my	 throw 	 s 	 	 be 	 came 	 	more	like	 th 	 is 	 	.	a	bit	better	.
i	thought	,	the	yo	-	yo	is	 some 	 thing 	 	for	me	to	be	good	at	,	for	the	first	time	in	my	life	.	i	found	my	 pass 	 ion 	 	.
i	was	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	all	my	time	 p 	 rac 	 tic 	 ing 	 	.
it	took	me	 hour 	 s 	 	and	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	to	build	my	 skill 	 s 	 	up	to	the	next	level	.
and	then	,	four	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	when	i	was	18	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	i	was	 stand 	 ing 	 	 on 	 stage 	 	at	the	world	yo	-	yo	contest	.
and	i	won	.
i	was	so	 excit 	 ed 	 	.	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	i	did	it	!	i	 be 	 came 	 	a	hero	.
i	may	get	 man 	 y 	 	 sponsor 	 s 	 	,	a	lot	of	money	,	 ton 	 s 	 	of	 interview 	 s 	 	,	and	be	on	tv	!	``	i	thought	.	but	after	coming	back	to	japan	,	 total 	 ly 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	 change 	 d 	 	in	my	life	.
i	 real 	 ized 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	did	n't	value	my	 pass 	 ion 	 	.
so	i	went	back	to	my	college	and	 be 	 came 	 	a	typical	japanese	 work 	 er 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 system 	 s 	 	engineer	.
i	felt	my	 pass 	 ion 	 	,	heart	and	soul	,	had	left	my	body	.
i	felt	i	was	not	 al 	 ive 	 	 any 	 more 	 	.
so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	consider	what	i	should	do	,	and	i	thought	,	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	make	my	performance	better	,	and	to	show	 on 	 stage 	 	how	spectacular	the	yo	-	yo	could	be	to	change	the	public	's	image	of	the	yo	-	yo	.
so	i	quit	my	company	and	 start 	 ed 	 	a	 care 	 er 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	professional	 perform 	 er 	 	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	learn	classic	ballet	,	jazz	dance	,	 acrobatic 	 s 	 	and	other	 thing 	 s 	 	to	make	my	performance	better	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	these	 effort 	 s 	 	,	and	the	help	of	 man 	 y 	 	 other 	 s 	 	,	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
i	won	the	world	yo	-	yo	contest	 aga 	 in 	 	in	the	 art 	 istic 	 	performance	division	.
i	 pass 	 ed 	 	an	audition	for	cirque	du	soleil	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	i	am	 stand 	 ing 	 	on	the	ted	stage	with	the	yo	-	yo	in	front	of	you	.
what	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	the	yo	-	yo	is	,	if	i	make	 en 	 ough 	 	effort	with	huge	 pass 	 ion 	 	,	there	is	no	 im 	 possible 	 	.
could	you	let	me	share	my	 pass 	 ion 	 	with	you	through	my	performance	?
