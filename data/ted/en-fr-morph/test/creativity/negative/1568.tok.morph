it	's	a	great	time	to	be	a	 mole 	 cular 	 	biologist	.	 read 	 ing 	 	and	writing	dna	code	is	 get 	 ting 	 	 eas 	 ier 	 	and	 cheap 	 er 	 	.
by	the	end	of	 th 	 is 	 	year	,	we	'll	be	able	to	sequence	the	three	million	bits	of	information	in	your	genome	in	less	than	a	day	and	for	less	than	1,000	 eur 	 os 	 	.
 bio 	 tech 	 	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	most	 power 	 ful 	 	and	the	 fast 	 est 	 	-	growing	technology	sector	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	the	power	,	 potential 	 ly 	 	,	to	replace	our	fossil	 fuel 	 s 	 	,	to	 revolution 	 ize 	 	medicine	,	and	to	touch	every	 a 	 spect 	 	of	our	 dai 	 ly 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
so	who	 get 	 s 	 	to	do	it	?
i	think	we	'd	all	be	 pre 	 tty 	 	 comfort 	 able 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	guy	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
but	what	about
that	guy	?	in	2009	,	i	first	heard	about	diybio	.
it	's	a	 move 	 ment 	 	that	--	it	 advoc 	 ates 	 	making	 bio 	 technology 	 	 access 	 ible 	 	to	 every 	 one 	 	,	not	just	 scientist 	 s 	 	and	people	in	government	 lab 	 s 	 	.
the	idea	is	that	if	you	open	up	the	science	and	you	allow	 divers 	 e 	 	 group 	 s 	 	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	,	it	could	 re 	 ally 	 	 stimul 	 ate 	 	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
 put 	 ting 	 	technology	in	the	 hand 	 s 	 	of	the	end	user	is	 usual 	 ly 	 	a	good	idea	 be 	 cause 	 	they	've	got	the	best	idea	of	what	 the 	 ir 	 	 need 	 s 	 	are	.
and	here	's	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	technology	coming	down	the	road	,	all	these	 associate 	 d 	 	social	,	moral	,	 ethic 	 al 	 	 question 	 s 	 	,	and	we	 scientist 	 s 	 	are	just	 lous 	 y 	 	at	 explain 	 ing 	 	to	the	public	just	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	it	is	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 lab 	 s 	 	.
so	would	n't	it	be	nice	if	there	was	a	place	in	your	local	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	where	you	could	go	and	learn	about	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	,	do	it	 hand 	 s 	 	-	on	?
i	thought	so	.
so	,	three	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	got	together	with	some	 friend 	 s 	 	of	mine	who	had	similar	 aspir 	 ations 	 	and	we	 found 	 ed 	 	genspace	.
it	's	a	 non 	 profit 	 	,	a	community	 bio 	 tech 	 	lab	in	brooklyn	,	new	york	,
and	the	idea	was	people	could	come	,	they	could	take	 class 	 es 	 	and	putter	around	in	the	lab	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	open	,	friendly	atmosphere	.
 non 	 e 	 	of	my	previous	experience	prepared	me	for	what	came	next	.	can	you	guess	?
the	press	 start 	 ed 	 	 call 	 ing 	 	us	.
and	the	more	we	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	how	great	it	was	to	 in 	 crease 	 	science	 liter 	 acy 	 	,	the	more	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	talk	about	us	creating	the	next	frankenstein	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	,	for	the	next	six	 month 	 s 	 	,	when	you	googled	my	name	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 get 	 ting 	 	my	scientific	 paper 	 s 	 	,	you	got	 th 	 is 	 	.
[	``	am	i	a	biohazard	?	``	]	it	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	 depress 	 ing 	 	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	that	got	us	through	that	period	was	that	we	 k 	 new 	 	that	all	over	the	world	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	other	people	that	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	the	same	thing	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 open 	 ing 	 	biohacker	 space 	 s 	 	,	and	some	of	them	 we 	 re 	 	facing	much	 great 	 er 	 	 challeng 	 es 	 	than	we	did	,
more	 regulat 	 ions 	 	,	less	 resource 	 s 	 	.
but	now	,	three	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	here	's	where	we	stand	.
it	's	a	 vib 	 rant 	 	,	global	community	of	 hack 	 er 	 space 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
these	are	some	of	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 one 	 s 	 	,	and	there	are	 other 	 s 	 	 open 	 ing 	 	every	day	.
there	's	one	 prob 	 ably 	 	going	to	open	up	in	moscow	,	one	in	south	korea	,	and	the	cool	thing	is	they	each	have	 the 	 ir 	 	own	individual	flavor	that	grew	out	of	the	community	they	came	out	of	.
let	me	take	you	on	a	little	tour	.
biohackers	work	 al 	 one 	 	.
we	work	in	 group 	 s 	 	,	in	big	cities	--	--	and	in	small	 village 	 s 	 	.
we	reverse	engineer	lab	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	.
we	 genetic 	 ally 	 	engineer	bacteria	.
we	hack	 hard 	 ware 	 	,	 soft 	 ware 	 	,	 wet 	 ware 	 	,	and	,	of	course	,	the	code	of	life	.
we	like	to	build	 thing 	 s 	 	.
then	we	like	to	take	 thing 	 s 	 	 a 	 part 	 	.
we	make	 thing 	 s 	 	grow	.
we	make	 thing 	 s 	 	glow	.
and	we	make	 cell 	 s 	 	dance	.
the	spirit	of	these	 lab 	 s 	 	,	it	's	open	,	it	's	positive	,	but	,	you	know	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	when	people	think	of	us	,	the	first	thing	that	 come 	 s 	 	to	mind	is	bio	-	 safe 	 ty 	 	,	bio	-	security	,	all	the	dark	side	stuff	.
i	'm	not	going	to	 minim 	 ize 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 concern 	 s 	 	.
any	 power 	 ful 	 	technology	is	 inherent 	 ly 	 	dual	use	,	and	,	you	know	,	you	get	 some 	 thing 	 	like	synthetic	biology	,	nanobiotechnology	,	it	 re 	 ally 	 	compels	you	,	you	have	to	look	at	both	the	amateur	 group 	 s 	 	but	 al 	 so 	 	the	professional	 group 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	have	better	 infra 	 structure 	 	,	they	have	better	 facil 	 ities 	 	,	and	they	have	access	to	 pathogen 	 s 	 	.
so	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	did	just	that	,	and	they	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 issue 	 d 	 	a	report	on	 th 	 is 	 	whole	area	,	and	what	they	 conclude 	 d 	 	was	the	power	of	 th 	 is 	 	technology	for	positive	was	much	 great 	 er 	 	than	the	risk	for	negative	,
and	they	even	 look 	 ed 	 	 specific 	 ally 	 	at	the	diybio	community	,	and	they	 not 	 ed 	 	,	not	 surprising 	 ly 	 	,	that	the	press	had	a	 tend 	 ency 	 	to	 consist 	 ent 	 ly 	 	 over 	 estimate 	 	our	 cap 	 abilities 	 	and	 under 	 estimate 	 	our	 ethic 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	matter	of	fact	,	diy	people	from	all	over	the	world	,	america	,	europe	,	got	together	last	year	,	and	we	hammered	out	a	common	code	of	 ethic 	 s 	 	.
that	's	a	lot	more	than	 convention 	 al 	 	science	 ha 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	.
now	,	we	follow	state	and	local	 regulat 	 ions 	 	.	we	 dispos 	 e 	 	of	our	waste	 proper 	 ly 	 	,	we	follow	 safe 	 ty 	 	 procedure 	 s 	 	,	we	do	n't	work	with	 pathogen 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	if	you	're	 work 	 ing 	 	with	a	pathogen	,	you	're	not	part	of	the	biohacker	community	,	you	're	part	of	the	 bio 	 terrorist 	 	community	,	i	'm	sorry	.
and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	people	ask	me	,	``	well	,	what	about	an	accident	?	``
well	,	 work 	 ing 	 	with	the	safe	 organism 	 s 	 	that	we	 normal 	 ly 	 	work	with	,	the	chance	of	an	accident	 happen 	 ing 	 	with	 some 	 body 	 	 accident 	 ally 	 	creating	,	like	,	some	sort	of	superbug	,	that	's	 liter 	 ally 	 	about	 a 	 s 	 	 prob 	 able 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	snowstorm	in	the	middle	of	the	sahara	desert	.
now	,	it	could	happen	,	but	i	'm	not	going	to	plan	my	life	around	it	.
i	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	 chose 	 n 	 	to	take	a	different	kind	of	risk	.
i	 sign 	 ed 	 	up	for	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	personal	genome	project	.
it	's	a	 stud 	 y 	 	at	harvard	where	,	at	the	end	of	the	 stud 	 y 	 	,	they	're	going	to	take	my	entire	genomic	sequence	,	all	of	my	medical	information	,	and	my	 ident 	 ity 	 	,	and	they	're	going	to	post	it	 on 	 line 	 	for	 every 	 one 	 	to	see	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	a	lot	of	 risk 	 s 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	that	they	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	 inform 	 ed 	 	consent	 port 	 ion 	 	.
the	one	i	 like 	 d 	 	the	best	is	,	 some 	 one 	 	could	download	my	sequence	,	go	back	to	the	lab	,	synthesize	some	fake	ellen	dna	,	and	plant	it	at	a	crime	scene	.
but	like	diybio	,	the	positive	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	and	the	potential	for	good	for	a	 stud 	 y 	 	like	that	far	 outweigh 	 s 	 	the	risk	.
now	,	you	might	be	 ask 	 ing 	 	 your 	 self 	 	,	``	well	,	you	know	,	what	would	i	do	in	a	biolab	?	``	well	,	it	was	n't	that	long	ago	we	 we 	 re 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	,	``	well	,	what	would	 any 	 one 	 	do	with	a	personal	computer	?	``
so	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	is	just	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
we	're	 on 	 ly 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	just	the	tip	of	the	dna	 ice 	 berg 	 	.
let	me	show	you	what	you	could	do	right	now	.
a	biohacker	in	germany	,	a	journalist	,	 want 	 ed 	 	to	know	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	dog	was	 leav 	 ing 	 	little	 present 	 s 	 	on	his	street	?
 y 	 ep 	 	,	you	 guess 	 ed 	 	it	.	he	threw	tennis	 ball 	 s 	 	to	all	the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	 dog 	 s 	 	,	 analyz 	 ed 	 	the	saliva	,	identified	the	dog	,	and	 confront 	 ed 	 	the	dog	owner	.
i	 discover 	 ed 	 	an	invasive	species	in	my	own	 back 	 yard 	 	.
 look 	 ed 	 	like	a	ladybug	,	right	?
it	 actual 	 ly 	 	is	a	japanese	beetle	.
and	the	same	kind	of	technology	--	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	dna	barcoding	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	--	you	can	use	it	to	check	if	your	caviar	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 bel 	 uga 	 	,	if	that	sushi	is	 re 	 ally 	 	tuna	,	or	if	that	goat	cheese	that	you	paid	so	much	for	is	 re 	 ally 	 	goat	's	.
in	a	biohacker	space	,	you	can	 analyz 	 e 	 	your	genome	for	 mutation 	 s 	 	.
you	can	 analyz 	 e 	 	your	 break 	 fast 	 	 ce 	 real 	 	for	gmo	's	,	and	you	can	explore	your	 ance 	 stry 	 	.
you	can	 s 	 end 	 	weather	 balloon 	 s 	 	up	 in 	 to 	 	the	 strato 	 sphere 	 	,	collect	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	,	see	what	's	up	there	.
you	can	make	a	biocensor	out	of	 y 	 east 	 	to	detect	 pollutant 	 s 	 	in	water	.
you	can	make	some	sort	of	a	 bio 	 fuel 	 	cell	.	you	can	do	a	lot	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
you	can	 al 	 so 	 	do	an	art	science	project	.	some	of	these	are	 re 	 ally 	 	spectacular	,	and	they	look	at	social	,	 eco 	 logical 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	from	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	.
some	people	ask	me	,	well	,	why	am	i	 involve 	 d 	 	?
i	could	have	a	 perfect 	 ly 	 	good	 care 	 er 	 	in	 main 	 stream 	 	science	.
the	thing	is	,	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	in	these	 lab 	 s 	 	that	they	have	to	 off 	 er 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	that	you	ca	n't	find	 any 	 where 	 	else	.
there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	sacred	about	a	space	where	you	can	work	on	a	project	,	and	you	do	n't	have	to	 just 	 ify 	 	to	 any 	 one 	 	that	it	's	going	to	make	a	lot	of	money	,	that	it	's	going	to	 s 	 ave 	 	 man 	 kind 	 	,	or	even	that	it	's	 feas 	 ible 	 	.
it	just	 ha 	 s 	 	to	follow	 safe 	 ty 	 	 guide 	 lines 	 	.
if	you	had	 space 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	all	over	the	world	,	it	could	 re 	 ally 	 	change	the	 per 	 ception 	 	of	who	's	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	do	 bio 	 tech 	 	.
it	's	 space 	 s 	 	like	these	that	 spawn 	 ed 	 	personal	computing	.
why	not	personal	 bio 	 tech 	 	?
if	 every 	 one 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	got	 involve 	 d 	 	,	who	 know 	 s 	 	what	we	could	do	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	 s 	 uch 	 	a	new	area	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	we	say	back	in	brooklyn	,	you	ai	n't	 s 	 een 	 	nothin	'	yet	.
