i	want	you	to	imagine	 th 	 is 	 	for	a	moment	.	two	men	,	rahul	and	rajiv	,	living	in	the	same	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	,	from	the	same	 education 	 al 	 	 back 	 ground 	 	,	similar	occupation	,	and	they	both	turn	up	at	 the 	 ir 	 	local	accident	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	 complain 	 ing 	 	of	 a 	 cute 	 	chest	pain	.
rahul	is	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	a	cardiac	procedure	,	but	rajiv	is	 s 	 ent 	 	home	.
what	might	explain	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	the	experience	of	these	two	 near 	 ly 	 	 ident 	 ical 	 	men	?
rajiv	 suffer 	 s 	 	from	a	mental	 ill 	 ness 	 	.
the	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	the	quality	of	medical	care	 receiv 	 ed 	 	by	people	with	mental	 ill 	 ness 	 	is	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	why	they	live	 short 	 er 	 	 live 	 s 	 	than	people	 with 	 out 	 	mental	 ill 	 ness 	 	.
even	in	the	best	-	 resource 	 d 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	in	the	world	,	 th 	 is 	 	life	 expect 	 ancy 	 	gap	is	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	20	 year 	 s 	 	.
in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	of	the	world	,	 th 	 is 	 	gap	is	even	 large 	 r 	 	.
but	of	course	,	mental	 ill 	 ness 	 es 	 	can	kill	in	more	direct	ways	 a 	 s 	 	well	.	the	most	obvious	 ex 	 ample 	 	is	 su 	 icide 	 	.
it	might	surprise	some	of	you	here	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	did	me	,	when	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	 su 	 icide 	 	is	at	the	top	of	the	list	of	the	 lead 	 ing 	 	 cause 	 s 	 	of	death	in	young	people	in	all	 count 	 ries 	 	in	the	world	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	the	 poor 	 est 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	of	the	world	.
but	beyond	the	impact	of	a	health	condition	on	life	 expect 	 ancy 	 	,	we	're	 al 	 so 	 	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	the	quality	of	life	lived	.
now	,	in	order	for	us	to	examine	the	 over 	 all 	 	impact	of	a	health	condition	both	on	life	 expect 	 ancy 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	on	the	quality	of	life	lived	,	we	need	to	use	a	metric	 call 	 ed 	 	the	daly	,	which	 stand 	 s 	 	for	a	 dis 	 ability 	 	-	 adjust 	 ed 	 	life	year	.	now	when	we	do	that	,	we	discover	some	 start 	 ling 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	about	mental	 ill 	 ness 	 	from	a	global	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	.
we	discover	that	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	mental	 ill 	 ness 	 es 	 	are	 among 	 st 	 	the	 lead 	 ing 	 	 cause 	 s 	 	of	 dis 	 ability 	 	around	the	world	.
 depress 	 ion 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	is	the	third	-	 lead 	 ing 	 	cause	of	 dis 	 ability 	 	,	 a 	 long 	 side 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 dia 	 rrhea 	 	and	 pneumo 	 nia 	 	in	children	.
when	you	put	all	the	mental	 ill 	 ness 	 es 	 	together	,	they	account	for	 rough 	 ly 	 	15	percent	of	the	total	global	burden	of	disease	.
 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	mental	 ill 	 ness 	 es 	 	are	 al 	 so 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 dam 	 aging 	 	to	people	's	 live 	 s 	 	,	but	beyond	just	the	burden	of	disease	,	let	us	consider	the	absolute	 number 	 s 	 	.
the	world	health	 organ 	 ization 	 	 estimate 	 s 	 	that	there	are	 near 	 ly 	 	four	to	five	hundred	million	people	living	on	our	 tin 	 y 	 	planet	who	are	 affect 	 ed 	 	by	a	mental	 ill 	 ness 	 	.
now	some	of	you	here	look	a	bit	 astonish 	 ed 	 	by	that	number	,	but	consider	for	a	moment	the	 in 	 credible 	 	 divers 	 ity 	 	of	mental	 ill 	 ness 	 es 	 	,	from	 aut 	 ism 	 	and	intellectual	 dis 	 ability 	 	in	 child 	 hood 	 	,	through	to	 depress 	 ion 	 	and	 anxie 	 ty 	 	,	 sub 	 stance 	 	 mis 	 use 	 	and	 psycho 	 sis 	 	in	 adult 	 hood 	 	,	all	the	way	through	to	 de 	 ment 	 ia 	 	in	old	age	,	and	i	'm	 pre 	 tty 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	that	each	and	every	one	us	present	here	 to 	 day 	 	can	think	of	at	 l 	 east 	 	one	person	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	one	person	,	who	's	 affect 	 ed 	 	by	mental	 ill 	 ness 	 	in	our	most	 intima 	 te 	 	social	 network 	 s 	 	.
i	see	some	 nod 	 d 	 ing 	 	 head 	 s 	 	there	.
but	beyond	the	 stagger 	 ing 	 	 number 	 s 	 	,	what	's	 tru 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	from	a	global	health	point	of	view	,	what	's	 tru 	 ly 	 	 worry 	 ing 	 	from	a	global	health	point	of	view	,	is	that	the	vast	 major 	 ity 	 	of	these	 affect 	 ed 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	do	not	 receiv 	 e 	 	the	care	that	we	know	can	transform	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	,	and	remember	,	we	do	have	 ro 	 bust 	 	evidence	that	a	range	of	 intervention 	 s 	 	,	 medicine 	 s 	 	,	 psycho 	 logical 	 	 intervention 	 s 	 	,	and	social	 intervention 	 s 	 	,	can	make	a	vast	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
and	yet	,	even	in	the	best	-	 resource 	 d 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	here	in	europe	,	 rough 	 ly 	 	50	percent	of	 affect 	 ed 	 	people	do	n't	 receiv 	 e 	 	these	 intervention 	 s 	 	.
in	the	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 count 	 ries 	 	i	work	in	,	that	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	 treat 	 ment 	 	gap	 approach 	 es 	 	an	 astonish 	 ing 	 	90	percent	.
it	is	n't	surprising	,	then	,	that	if	you	should	speak	to	 any 	 one 	 	 affect 	 ed 	 	by	a	mental	 ill 	 ness 	 	,	the	 chance 	 s 	 	are	that	you	will	hear	 st 	 ories 	 	of	 hid 	 den 	 	 suffer 	 ing 	 	,	shame	and	 discrimi 	 nation 	 	in	 near 	 ly 	 	every	sector	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
but	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	most	 heart 	 break 	 ing 	 	of	all	are	the	 st 	 ories 	 	of	the	abuse	of	even	the	most	 bas 	 ic 	 	human	 right 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	young	woman	 show 	 n 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	image	here	that	are	 play 	 ed 	 	out	every	day	,	 s 	 ad 	 ly 	 	,	even	in	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 institution 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	built	to	care	for	people	with	mental	 ill 	 ness 	 es 	 	,	the	mental	 hospital 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 justice 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	driven	my	mission	to	try	to	do	a	little	bit	to	transform	the	 live 	 s 	 	of	people	 affect 	 ed 	 	by	mental	 ill 	 ness 	 	,	and	a	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	critical	action	that	i	focused	on	is	to	bridge	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	between	the	knowledge	we	have	that	can	transform	 live 	 s 	 	,	the	knowledge	of	effective	 treat 	 ments 	 	,	and	how	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	use	that	knowledge	in	the	 every 	 day 	 	world	.
and	an	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 challeng 	 e 	 	that	i	've	had	to	face	is	the	great	 short 	 age 	 	of	mental	health	 professional 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 psychiatrist 	 s 	 	and	 psycho 	 logists 	 	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	.
now	i	trained	in	medicine	in	india	,	and	after	that	i	chose	 psych 	 iatry 	 	 a 	 s 	 	my	 special 	 ty 	 	,	much	to	the	 dis 	 may 	 	of	my	mother	and	all	my	family	 member 	 s 	 	who	kind	of	thought	 neuro 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	would	be	a	more	 respect 	 able 	 	option	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 brilli 	 ant 	 	son	.
any	case	,	i	went	on	,	i	soldiered	on	with	 psych 	 iatry 	 	,	and	found	 my 	 self 	 	training	in	britain	in	some	of	the	best	 hospital 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	.	i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 privilege 	 d 	 	.
i	 work 	 ed 	 	in	a	team	of	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 talent 	 ed 	 	,	 com 	 passionate 	 	,	but	most	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	 high 	 ly 	 	trained	,	 special 	 ized 	 	mental	health	 professional 	 s 	 	.
soon	after	my	training	,	i	found	 my 	 self 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	first	in	zimbabwe	and	then	in	india	,	and	i	was	 confront 	 ed 	 	by	an	 al 	 together 	 	new	 re 	 ality 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	 re 	 ality 	 	of	a	world	in	which	there	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 most 	 	no	mental	health	 professional 	 s 	 	at	all	.
in	zimbabwe	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	just	about	a	dozen	 psychiatrist 	 s 	 	,	most	of	whom	lived	and	 work 	 ed 	 	in	harare	city	,	 leav 	 ing 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	a	couple	to	address	the	mental	health	care	 need 	 s 	 	of	nine	million	people	living	in	the	 country 	 side 	 	.
in	india	,	i	found	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	was	not	a	lot	better	.
to	give	you	a	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	if	i	had	to	 transl 	 ate 	 	the	proportion	of	 psychiatrist 	 s 	 	in	the	population	that	one	might	see	in	britain	to	india	,	one	might	expect	 rough 	 ly 	 	150,000	 psychiatrist 	 s 	 	in	india	.
in	 re 	 ality 	 	,	take	a	guess	.
the	actual	number	is	about	3,000	,	about	two	percent	of	that	number	.
it	 be 	 came 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	 ap 	 parent 	 	to	me	that	i	could	n't	follow	the	 sort 	 s 	 	of	mental	health	care	 model 	 s 	 	that	i	had	 be 	 en 	 	trained	in	,	one	that	 reli 	 ed 	 	 heav 	 ily 	 	on	 special 	 ized 	 	,	expensive	mental	health	 professional 	 s 	 	to	provide	mental	health	care	in	 count 	 ries 	 	like	india	and	zimbabwe	.
i	had	to	think	out	of	the	box	about	some	other	model	of	care	.
it	was	then	that	i	came	 a 	 cross 	 	these	 book 	 s 	 	,	and	in	these	 book 	 s 	 	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	the	idea	of	task	shifting	in	global	health	.
the	idea	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	simple	.	the	idea	is	,	when	you	're	short	of	 special 	 ized 	 	health	care	 professional 	 s 	 	,	use	 who 	 ever 	 	is	 avail 	 able 	 	in	the	community	,	train	them	to	provide	a	range	of	health	care	 intervention 	 s 	 	,	and	in	these	 book 	 s 	 	i	read	inspiring	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	how	 ordin 	 ary 	 	people	had	 be 	 en 	 	trained	to	deliver	 bab 	 ies 	 	,	 diagnos 	 e 	 	and	treat	early	 pneumo 	 nia 	 	,	to	great	effect	.
and	it	 s 	 truck 	 	me	that	if	you	could	train	 ordin 	 ary 	 	people	to	deliver	 s 	 uch 	 	complex	health	care	 intervention 	 s 	 	,	then	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	they	could	 al 	 so 	 	do	the	same	with	mental	health	care	.
well	 to 	 day 	 	,	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	 pleas 	 ed 	 	to	report	to	you	that	there	have	 be 	 en 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 experiment 	 s 	 	in	task	shifting	in	mental	health	care	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	over	the	past	decade	,	and	i	want	to	share	with	you	the	 find 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	three	 part 	 icular 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	all	three	of	which	focused	on	 depress 	 ion 	 	,	the	most	common	of	all	mental	 ill 	 ness 	 es 	 	.
in	 r 	 ural 	 	uganda	,	paul	bolton	and	his	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	,	using	 village 	 rs 	 	,	 demonst 	 rated 	 	that	they	could	deliver	 inter 	 personal 	 	 psycho 	 therapy 	 	for	 depress 	 ion 	 	and	,	using	a	 random 	 ized 	 	control	design	,	 show 	 ed 	 	that	90	percent	of	the	people	 receiv 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	intervention	 re 	 cover 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	 rough 	 ly 	 	40	percent	in	the	 compar 	 ison 	 	 village 	 s 	 	.
 similar 	 ly 	 	,	using	a	 random 	 ized 	 	control	trial	in	 r 	 ural 	 	pakistan	,	atif	rahman	and	his	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	 show 	 ed 	 	that	 lad 	 y 	 	health	 visit 	 ors 	 	,	who	are	community	 ma 	 ternal 	 	health	 work 	 ers 	 	in	pakistan	's	health	care	system	,	could	deliver	cognitive	behavior	therapy	for	 mother 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	 depress 	 ed 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	 show 	 ing 	 	 dramat 	 ic 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	in	the	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	rates	.	 rough 	 ly 	 	75	percent	of	 mother 	 s 	 	 re 	 cover 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	about	45	percent	in	the	 compar 	 ison 	 	 village 	 s 	 	.
and	in	my	own	trial	in	goa	,	in	india	,	we	 aga 	 in 	 	 show 	 ed 	 	that	lay	 counsel 	 ors 	 	drawn	from	local	 commun 	 ities 	 	could	be	trained	to	deliver	 psycho 	 social 	 	 intervention 	 s 	 	for	 depress 	 ion 	 	,	 anxie 	 ty 	 	,	 lead 	 ing 	 	to	70	percent	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	rates	 a 	 s 	 	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	50	percent	in	the	 compar 	 ison 	 	 prim 	 ary 	 	health	 center 	 s 	 	.
now	,	if	i	had	to	draw	together	all	these	different	 experiment 	 s 	 	in	task	shifting	,	and	there	have	of	course	 be 	 en 	 	 man 	 y 	 	other	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	,	and	try	and	identify	what	are	the	key	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	we	can	learn	that	 make 	 s 	 	for	a	 success 	 ful 	 	task	shifting	operation	,	i	have	 co 	 in 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	acronym	,	sundar	.
what	sundar	 stand 	 s 	 	for	,	in	hindi	,	is	``	 attract 	 ive 	 	.	``
it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	that	there	are	five	key	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	that	i	've	 show 	 n 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	slide	that	are	 critical 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	for	effective	task	shifting	.
the	first	is	that	we	need	to	 simpl 	 ify 	 	the	 mess 	 age 	 	that	we	're	using	,	 strip 	 ping 	 	away	all	the	 jar 	 gon 	 	that	medicine	 ha 	 s 	 	 invent 	 ed 	 	around	 it 	 self 	 	.
we	need	to	 un 	 pack 	 	complex	health	care	 intervention 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 small 	 er 	 	 component 	 s 	 	that	can	be	more	 eas 	 ily 	 	 transfer 	 red 	 	to	less	-	trained	 individual 	 s 	 	.
we	need	to	deliver	health	care	,	not	in	large	 institution 	 s 	 	,	but	close	to	people	's	 home 	 s 	 	,	and	we	need	to	deliver	health	care	using	 who 	 ever 	 	is	 avail 	 able 	 	and	 afford 	 able 	 	in	our	local	 commun 	 ities 	 	.
and	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	we	need	to	reallocate	the	few	 special 	 ists 	 	who	are	 avail 	 able 	 	to	perform	 role 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	-	building	and	 super 	 vision 	 	.
now	for	me	,	task	shifting	is	an	idea	with	 tru 	 ly 	 	global	 sign 	 ific 	 ance 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	even	 th 	 ough 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 arise 	 n 	 	out	of	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	of	the	lack	of	 resource 	 s 	 	that	you	find	in	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	i	think	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	 sign 	 ific 	 ance 	 	for	better	-	 resource 	 d 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.	why	is	that	?
well	,	in	part	,	 be 	 cause 	 	health	care	in	the	 develop 	 ed 	 	world	,	the	health	care	 cost 	 s 	 	in	the	[	 develop 	 ed 	 	]	world	,	are	 rapid 	 ly 	 	 spiral 	 ing 	 	out	of	control	,	and	a	huge	chunk	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	are	human	resource	 cost 	 s 	 	.
but	 equal 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	health	care	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	so	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 professional 	 ized 	 	that	it	's	 be 	 come 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	remote	and	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	from	local	 commun 	 ities 	 	.
for	me	,	what	's	 tru 	 ly 	 	sundar	about	the	idea	of	task	shifting	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	is	n't	that	it	 simpl 	 y 	 	 make 	 s 	 	health	care	more	 access 	 ible 	 	and	 afford 	 able 	 	but	that	it	is	 al 	 so 	 	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	 empower 	 ing 	 	.
it	 empower 	 s 	 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	people	to	be	more	effective	in	 car 	 ing 	 	for	the	health	of	 other 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	community	,	and	in	 do 	 ing 	 	so	,	to	 be 	 come 	 	better	 guard 	 ians 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	health	.	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	for	me	,	task	shifting	is	the	ultimate	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	the	 democrat 	 ization 	 	of	medical	knowledge	,	and	 there 	 fore 	 	,	medical	power	.
just	over	30	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	the	 nation 	 s 	 	of	the	world	 assemble 	 d 	 	at	 al 	 ma 	 	-	ata	and	made	 th 	 is 	 	 icon 	 ic 	 	 decla 	 ration 	 	.
well	,	i	think	all	of	you	can	guess	that	12	 year 	 s 	 	on	,	we	're	still	 no 	 where 	 	near	that	goal	.
still	,	 to 	 day 	 	,	 arm 	 ed 	 	with	that	knowledge	that	 ordin 	 ary 	 	people	in	the	community	can	be	trained	and	,	with	sufficient	 super 	 vision 	 	and	support	,	can	deliver	a	range	of	health	care	 intervention 	 s 	 	 effective 	 ly 	 	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	that	promise	is	 with 	 in 	 	reach	now	.
 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	to	implement	the	slogan	of	health	for	all	,	we	will	need	to	involve	all	in	that	 part 	 icular 	 	journey	,	and	in	the	case	of	mental	health	,	in	 part 	 icular 	 	we	would	need	to	involve	people	who	are	 affect 	 ed 	 	by	mental	 ill 	 ness 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 care 	 giver 	 s 	 	.
it	is	for	 th 	 is 	 	reason	that	,	some	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	the	 move 	 ment 	 	for	global	mental	health	was	 found 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	sort	of	a	virtual	platform	 up 	 on 	 	which	 professional 	 s 	 	like	 my 	 self 	 	and	people	 affect 	 ed 	 	by	mental	 ill 	 ness 	 	could	stand	together	,	shoulder	-	to	-	shoulder	,	and	 advoc 	 ate 	 	for	the	 right 	 s 	 	of	people	with	mental	 ill 	 ness 	 	to	 receiv 	 e 	 	the	care	that	we	know	can	transform	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	,	and	to	live	a	life	with	dignity	.
and	in	 clo 	 s 	 ing 	 	,	when	you	have	a	moment	of	peace	or	quiet	in	these	 ver 	 y 	 	 bus 	 y 	 	few	 day 	 s 	 	or	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	spare	a	thought	for	that	person	you	thought	about	who	 ha 	 s 	 	a	mental	 ill 	 ness 	 	,	or	 person 	 s 	 	that	you	thought	about	who	have	mental	 ill 	 ness 	 	,	and	 da 	 re 	 	to	care	for	them	.	thank	you	.
