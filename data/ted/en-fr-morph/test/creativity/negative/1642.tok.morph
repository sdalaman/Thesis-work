so	if	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	 follow 	 ing 	 	the	news	,	you	've	heard	that	there	's	a	pack	of	giant	 a 	 steroid 	 s 	 	headed	for	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	all	 schedule 	 d 	 	to	strike	 with 	 in 	 	the	next	50	 year 	 s 	 	.
now	i	do	n't	mean	actual	 a 	 steroid 	 s 	 	made	of	rock	and	metal	.
that	 actual 	 ly 	 	would	n't	be	 s 	 uch 	 	a	problem	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	we	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	all	going	to	die	,	we	would	put	 a 	 side 	 	our	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	,	we	'd	 s 	 pend 	 	 what 	 ever 	 	it	took	,	and	we	'd	find	a	way	to	deflect	them	.
i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	about	 threat 	 s 	 	that	are	headed	our	way	,	but	they	're	 wrap 	 ped 	 	in	a	special	energy	field	that	polarizes	us	,	and	 there 	 fore 	 	 paralyze 	 s 	 	us	.
last	march	,	i	went	to	the	ted	 con 	 ference 	 	,	and	i	saw	jim	hansen	speak	,	the	nasa	scientist	who	first	raised	the	alarm	about	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	in	the	1980s	,	and	it	 seem 	 s 	 	that	the	 predict 	 ions 	 	he	made	back	then	are	coming	true	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	where	we	're	headed	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	global	temperature	 rise 	 s 	 	,	and	if	we	keep	on	going	the	way	we	're	going	,	we	get	a	four	-	or	five	-	degree	-	 cent 	 i 	 grade 	 	temperature	rise	by	the	end	of	 th 	 is 	 	century	.
hansen	 say 	 s 	 	we	can	expect	about	a	five	-	meter	rise	in	sea	 level 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	a	five	-	meter	rise	in	sea	 level 	 s 	 	would	look	like	.
low	-	 ly 	 ing 	 	cities	all	around	the	world	will	disappear	 with 	 in 	 	the	 life 	 time 	 	of	children	born	 to 	 day 	 	.
hansen	closed	his	talk	by	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	imagine	a	giant	 a 	 steroid 	 	on	a	collision	course	with	earth	.
that	is	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	what	we	face	now	.
yet	we	 di 	 ther 	 	,	taking	no	action	to	deflect	the	 a 	 steroid 	 	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	the	 long 	 er 	 	we	wait	,	the	more	difficult	and	expensive	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	.	``	of	course	,	the	left	 want 	 s 	 	to	take	action	,	but	the	right	 deni 	 es 	 	that	there	's	any	problem	.
all	right	,	so	i	go	back	from	ted	,	and	then	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	week	,	i	'm	 invit 	 ed 	 	to	a	 d 	 inner 	 	party	in	washington	,	d.c.	,	where	i	know	that	i	'll	be	 meet 	 ing 	 	a	number	of	 conserv 	 ative 	 	 intellectual 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	yuval	levin	,	and	to	 prep 	 are 	 	for	the	 meet 	 ing 	 	,	i	read	 th 	 is 	 	article	by	levin	in	national	 af 	 fair 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	``	beyond	the	 wel 	 fare 	 	state	.	``
levin	 write 	 s 	 	that	all	over	the	world	,	 nation 	 s 	 	are	coming	to	 term 	 s 	 	with	the	fact	that	the	social	 democrat 	 ic 	 	 wel 	 fare 	 	state	is	 turn 	 ing 	 	out	to	be	 un 	 ten 	 able 	 	and	 un 	 afford 	 able 	 	,	dependent	 up 	 on 	 	 dub 	 ious 	 	 economic 	 s 	 	and	the	 demo 	 graphic 	 	model	of	a	 by 	 gone 	 	era	.
all	right	,	now	 th 	 is 	 	might	not	sound	 a 	 s 	 	 scar 	 y 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	 a 	 steroid 	 	,	but	look	at	these	 graph 	 s 	 	that	levin	 show 	 ed 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	graph	 show 	 s 	 	the	national	debt	 a 	 s 	 	a	 percent 	 age 	 	of	america	's	gdp	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	you	see	,	if	you	go	all	the	way	back	to	the	 found 	 ing 	 	,	we	 borrow 	 ed 	 	a	lot	of	money	to	fight	the	 revolution 	 ary 	 	war	.
 war 	 s 	 	are	expensive	.	but	then	we	'd	pay	it	off	,	pay	it	off	,	pay	it	off	,	and	then	,	oh	,	what	's	 th 	 is 	 	?	the	civil	war	.	even	more	expensive	.
borrow	a	lot	of	money	,	pay	it	off	,	pay	it	off	,	pay	it	off	,	get	down	to	near	zero	,	and	bang	!	--	world	war	i	.
once	 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	same	process	 repeat 	 s 	 	.
now	then	we	get	the	great	 depress 	 ion 	 	and	world	war	ii	.	we	rise	to	an	astronomical	level	,	around	118	percent	of	gdp	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 un 	 sustain 	 able 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
but	we	pay	it	off	,	pay	it	off	,	pay	it	off	,	and	then	,	what	's	 th 	 is 	 	?
why	 ha 	 s 	 	it	 be 	 en 	 	 ris 	 ing 	 	since	the	'70s	?
it	's	 part 	 ly 	 	due	to	tax	 cut 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	unfunded	,	but	it	's	due	 prim 	 arily 	 	to	the	rise	of	entitlement	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	medicare	.
we	're	 approach 	 ing 	 	the	 level 	 s 	 	of	 indebted 	 ness 	 	we	had	at	world	war	ii	,	and	the	baby	 boom 	 ers 	 	have	n't	even	 retire 	 d 	 	yet	,	and	when	they	do	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	will	happen	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	data	from	the	 congress 	 ional 	 	budget	 off 	 ice 	 	 show 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	most	realistic	 fore 	 cast 	 	of	what	would	happen	if	current	 situ 	 ations 	 	and	 expect 	 ations 	 	and	 trend 	 s 	 	are	 extend 	 ed 	 	.
all	right	,	now	what	you	might	notice	is	that	these	two	 graph 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ident 	 ical 	 	,	not	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	x	-	and	y	-	 axe 	 s 	 	,	or	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	data	they	present	,	but	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	moral	and	 politic 	 al 	 	 implic 	 ations 	 	,	they	say	the	same	thing	.
let	me	 transl 	 ate 	 	for	you	.
``	we	are	 doom 	 ed 	 	 un 	 less 	 	we	start	 act 	 ing 	 	now	.
what	's	wrong	with	you	people	on	the	other	side	in	the	other	party	?
ca	n't	you	see	 re 	 ality 	 	?	if	you	wo	n't	help	,	then	get	the	hell	out	of	the	way	.	``	we	can	deflect	both	of	these	 a 	 steroid 	 s 	 	.
these	 problem 	 s 	 	are	both	 technical 	 ly 	 	 so 	 lv 	 able 	 	.
our	problem	and	our	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	is	that	in	these	hyper	-	partisan	 time 	 s 	 	,	the	mere	fact	that	one	side	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	look	,	there	's	an	 a 	 steroid 	 	,	``	 mean 	 s 	 	that	the	other	side	's	going	to	say	,	``	huh	?	what	?
no	,	i	'm	not	even	going	to	look	up	.	no.	``	to	understand	why	 th 	 is 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	to	us	,	and	what	we	can	do	about	it	,	we	need	to	learn	more	about	moral	 psycho 	 logy 	 	.
so	i	'm	a	social	 psycho 	 logist 	 	,	and	i	 stud 	 y 	 	 moral 	 ity 	 	,	and	one	of	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 principle 	 s 	 	of	 moral 	 ity 	 	is	that	 moral 	 ity 	 	 bind 	 s 	 	and	 blind 	 s 	 	.
it	 bind 	 s 	 	us	 in 	 to 	 	 team 	 s 	 	that	circle	around	sacred	 value 	 s 	 	but	 there 	 by 	 	 make 	 s 	 	us	go	blind	to	 object 	 ive 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	.
think	of	it	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
large	-	scale	 co 	 operation 	 	is	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	rare	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	.
there	are	 on 	 ly 	 	a	few	species	that	can	do	it	.
that	's	a	 bee 	 hive 	 	.	that	's	a	 ter 	 mite 	 	mound	,	a	giant	 ter 	 mite 	 	mound	.
and	when	you	find	 th 	 is 	 	in	other	 animal 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 al 	 ways 	 	the	same	story	.
they	're	 al 	 ways 	 	all	 s 	 i 	 bling 	 s 	 	who	are	children	of	a	single	 que 	 en 	 	,	so	they	're	all	in	the	same	boat	.
they	rise	or	fall	,	they	live	or	die	,	 a 	 s 	 	one	.
there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	one	species	on	the	planet	that	can	do	 th 	 is 	 	 with 	 out 	 	kinship	,	and	that	,	of	course	,	is	us	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 re 	 construction 	 	of	ancient	babylon	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	tenochtitlan	.
now	how	did	we	do	 th 	 is 	 	?	how	did	we	go	from	 be 	 ing 	 	hunter	-	 gatherer 	 s 	 	10,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	to	building	these	 gig 	 antic 	 	cities	in	just	a	few	thousand	 year 	 s 	 	?
it	's	 miracul 	 ous 	 	,	and	part	of	the	 explan 	 ation 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	ability	to	circle	around	sacred	 value 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	see	,	 temple 	 s 	 	and	 god 	 s 	 	play	a	big	role	in	all	ancient	 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	image	of	muslims	 circl 	 ing 	 	the	kaaba	in	mecca	.
it	's	a	sacred	rock	,	and	when	people	circle	 some 	 thing 	 	together	,	they	 un 	 ite 	 	,	they	can	trust	each	other	,	they	 be 	 come 	 	one	.
it	's	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	you	're	moving	an	 electric 	 al 	 	wire	through	a	 magnet 	 ic 	 	field	that	 generate 	 s 	 	current	.
when	people	circle	together	,	they	generate	a	current	.
we	love	to	circle	around	 thing 	 s 	 	.	we	circle	around	 flag 	 s 	 	,	and	then	we	can	trust	each	other	.
we	can	fight	 a 	 s 	 	a	team	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	unit	.
but	even	 a 	 s 	 	 moral 	 ity 	 	 bind 	 s 	 	people	together	 in 	 to 	 	a	unit	,	 in 	 to 	 	a	team	,	the	 circl 	 ing 	 	 blind 	 s 	 	them	.
it	 cause 	 s 	 	them	to	distort	 re 	 ality 	 	.
we	begin	 separat 	 ing 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	good	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	 e 	 vil 	 	.
now	that	process	 feel 	 s 	 	great	.	it	 feel 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 satisfy 	 ing 	 	.
but	it	is	a	gross	 distort 	 ion 	 	of	 re 	 ality 	 	.
you	can	see	the	moral	 electro 	 magnet 	 	 oper 	 ating 	 	in	the	u.s.	congress	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	graph	that	 show 	 s 	 	the	degree	to	which	 vot 	 ing 	 	in	congress	 fall 	 s 	 	 strict 	 ly 	 	 a 	 long 	 	the	left	-	right	axis	,	so	that	if	you	know	how	liberal	or	 conserv 	 ative 	 	 some 	 one 	 	is	,	you	know	 exact 	 ly 	 	how	they	 vot 	 ed 	 	on	all	the	major	 issue 	 s 	 	.
and	what	you	can	see	is	that	,	in	the	 decade 	 s 	 	after	the	civil	war	,	congress	was	 extra 	 ordinari 	 ly 	 	 polar 	 ized 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	would	expect	,	about	 a 	 s 	 	high	 a 	 s 	 	can	be	.
but	then	,	after	world	war	i	,	 thing 	 s 	 	 drop 	 ped 	 	,	and	we	get	 th 	 is 	 	 historic 	 ally 	 	low	level	of	 polar 	 ization 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	 gold 	 en 	 	age	of	bipartisanship	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	 part 	 ies 	 	'	ability	to	work	together	and	solve	grand	national	 problem 	 s 	 	.
but	in	the	1980s	and	'90s	,	the	 electro 	 magnet 	 	 turn 	 s 	 	back	on	.
 polar 	 ization 	 	 rise 	 s 	 	.
it	used	to	be	that	 conserv 	 ative 	 s 	 	and	 moderate 	 s 	 	and	 liberal 	 s 	 	could	all	work	together	in	congress	.
they	could	 re 	 arrange 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	form	 bi 	 partisan 	 	 commit 	 tee 	 s 	 	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	the	moral	 electro 	 magnet 	 	got	 crank 	 ed 	 	up	,	the	force	field	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	,	 democrat 	 s 	 	and	republicans	 we 	 re 	 	 pull 	 ed 	 	 a 	 part 	 	.
it	 be 	 came 	 	much	 hard 	 er 	 	for	them	to	 social 	 ize 	 	,	much	 hard 	 er 	 	for	them	to	cooperate	.
 ret 	 ir 	 ing 	 	 member 	 s 	 	 now 	 a 	 day 	 s 	 	say	that	it	's	 be 	 come 	 	like	gang	 war 	 fare 	 	.
did	 any 	 body 	 	notice	that	in	two	of	the	three	 debate 	 s 	 	,	obama	 wo 	 re 	 	a	blue	tie	and	romney	 wo 	 re 	 	a	red	tie	?
do	you	know	why	they	do	 th 	 is 	 	?
it	's	so	that	the	 blood 	 s 	 	and	the	crips	will	know	which	side	to	vote	for	.
the	 polar 	 ization 	 	is	 strong 	 est 	 	among	our	 politic 	 al 	 	 elite 	 s 	 	.
 no 	 body 	 	 doubt 	 s 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	washington	.
but	for	a	while	,	there	was	some	doubt	 a 	 s 	 	to	 whet 	 her 	 	it	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	among	the	people	.
well	,	in	the	last	12	 year 	 s 	 	it	's	 be 	 come 	 	much	more	 ap 	 parent 	 	that	it	is	.
so	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	data	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	from	the	american	national	 election 	 s 	 	survey	.
and	what	they	do	on	that	survey	is	they	ask	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	a	 feel 	 ing 	 	 thermo 	 meter 	 	rating	.
so	,	how	warm	or	cold	do	you	feel	about	,	you	know	,	native	americans	,	or	the	 militar 	 y 	 	,	the	republican	party	,	the	 democrat 	 ic 	 	party	,	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 group 	 s 	 	in	american	life	.
the	blue	line	 show 	 s 	 	how	warmly	 democrat 	 s 	 	feel	about	 democrat 	 s 	 	,	and	they	like	them	.
you	know	,	 rating 	 s 	 	in	the	70s	on	a	100	-	point	scale	.
republicans	like	republicans	.	that	's	not	a	surprise	.
but	when	you	look	at	cross	-	party	 rating 	 s 	 	,	you	find	,	well	,	that	it	's	lower	,	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	when	i	first	saw	 th 	 is 	 	data	,	i	was	 surprise 	 d 	 	.
that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	not	so	bad	.	if	you	go	back	to	the	carter	and	even	reagan	 administr 	 ations 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	rating	the	other	party	43	,	45.	it	's	not	 terr 	 ible 	 	.
it	 drift 	 s 	 	 down 	 ward 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	,	but	now	look	what	 happen 	 s 	 	under	george	w.	bush	and	obama	.
it	 plummet 	 s 	 	.	 some 	 thing 	 	is	going	on	here	.
the	moral	 electro 	 magnet 	 	is	 turn 	 ing 	 	back	on	,	and	 now 	 a 	 day 	 s 	 	,	just	 ver 	 y 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	 democrat 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 dis 	 like 	 	republicans	.
republicans	 re 	 ally 	 	 dis 	 like 	 	the	 democrat 	 s 	 	.	we	're	changing	.
it	's	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	the	moral	 electro 	 magnet 	 	is	 affect 	 ing 	 	us	too	.
it	's	like	put	out	in	the	two	 ocean 	 s 	 	and	it	's	 pull 	 ing 	 	the	whole	country	 a 	 part 	 	,	 pull 	 ing 	 	left	and	right	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 territ 	 ories 	 	like	the	 blood 	 s 	 	and	the	crips	.
now	,	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	why	 th 	 is 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	to	us	,	and	 man 	 y 	 	of	them	we	can	not	reverse	.
we	will	never	 aga 	 in 	 	have	a	 politic 	 al 	 	class	that	was	 for 	 ged 	 	by	the	experience	of	 fight 	 ing 	 	together	in	world	war	ii	against	a	common	 ene 	 my 	 	.
we	will	never	 aga 	 in 	 	have	just	three	 tele 	 vision 	 	 network 	 s 	 	,	all	of	which	are	 relat 	 ively 	 	centrist	.
and	we	will	never	 aga 	 in 	 	have	a	large	group	of	 conserv 	 ative 	 	southern	 democrat 	 s 	 	and	liberal	 north 	 ern 	 	republicans	making	it	easy	,	making	there	be	a	lot	of	 over 	 lap 	 	for	 bi 	 partisan 	 	 co 	 operation 	 	.
so	for	a	lot	of	 reason 	 s 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 decade 	 s 	 	after	the	second	world	war	 we 	 re 	 	an	 historic 	 ally 	 	anomalous	time	.
we	will	never	get	back	to	 t 	 hose 	 	low	 level 	 s 	 	of	 polar 	 ization 	 	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	.
but	there	's	a	lot	that	we	can	do	.	there	are	 dozen 	 s 	 	and	 dozen 	 s 	 	of	 reform 	 s 	 	we	can	do	that	will	make	 thing 	 s 	 	better	,	 be 	 cause 	 	a	lot	of	our	 dy 	 s 	 function 	 	can	be	 trac 	 ed 	 	 direct 	 ly 	 	to	 thing 	 s 	 	that	congress	did	to	 it 	 self 	 	in	the	1990s	that	 create 	 d 	 	a	much	more	 polar 	 ized 	 	and	 dy 	 s 	 functional 	 	institution	.
these	 change 	 s 	 	are	 detail 	 ed 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	 book 	 s 	 	.
these	are	two	that	i	 strong 	 ly 	 	recommend	,	and	they	list	a	whole	bunch	of	 reform 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	just	going	to	group	them	 in 	 to 	 	three	broad	 class 	 es 	 	here	.
so	if	you	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	problem	of	a	 dy 	 s 	 functional 	 	,	hyper	-	 polar 	 ized 	 	institution	,	well	,	the	first	step	is	,	do	what	you	can	so	that	 few 	 er 	 	hyper	-	partisans	get	 elect 	 ed 	 	in	the	first	place	,	and	when	you	have	closed	party	 prim 	 aries 	 	,	and	 on 	 ly 	 	the	most	 commit 	 ted 	 	republicans	and	 democrat 	 s 	 	are	 vot 	 ing 	 	,	you	're	nominating	and	 select 	 ing 	 	the	most	 extrem 	 e 	 	hyper	-	partisans	.
so	open	 prim 	 aries 	 	would	make	that	problem	much	,	much	less	severe	.
but	the	problem	is	n't	 prim 	 arily 	 	that	we	're	electing	bad	people	to	congress	.
from	my	experience	,	and	from	what	i	've	heard	from	 congress 	 ional 	 	 insid 	 ers 	 	,	most	of	the	people	going	to	congress	are	good	,	hard	-	 work 	 ing 	 	,	intelligent	people	who	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	solve	 problem 	 s 	 	,	but	once	they	get	there	,	they	find	that	they	are	 force 	 d 	 	to	play	a	game	that	 reward 	 s 	 	hyper	-	 partisan 	 ship 	 	and	that	punishes	 in 	 dependent 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	.
you	step	out	of	line	,	you	get	 punish 	 ed 	 	.
so	there	are	a	lot	of	 reform 	 s 	 	we	could	do	that	will	 counter 	 act 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	``	 citizen 	 s 	 	 unit 	 ed 	 	``	 rul 	 ing 	 	is	a	disaster	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 mean 	 s 	 	there	's	like	a	money	gun	 aim 	 ed 	 	at	your	head	,	and	if	you	step	out	of	line	,	if	you	try	to	reach	 a 	 cross 	 	the	aisle	,	there	's	a	ton	of	money	 wait 	 ing 	 	to	be	 give 	 n 	 	to	your	opponent	to	make	 every 	 body 	 	think	that	you	are	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	person	through	negative	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	.
but	the	third	class	of	 reform 	 s 	 	is	that	we	've	got	to	change	the	nature	of	social	 relationship 	 s 	 	in	congress	.
the	 politic 	 ians 	 	i	've	met	are	 general 	 ly 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 extrovert 	 ed 	 	,	friendly	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 social 	 ly 	 	 skill 	 ful 	 	people	,	and	that	's	the	nature	of	 politic 	 s 	 	.	you	've	got	to	make	 relationship 	 s 	 	,	make	 deal 	 s 	 	,	you	've	got	to	cajole	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	,	flatter	,	you	've	got	to	use	your	personal	 skill 	 s 	 	,	and	that	's	the	way	 politic 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	.
but	 begin 	 ning 	 	in	the	1990s	,	first	the	house	of	 represent 	 ative 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 legisl 	 ative 	 	calendar	so	that	all	business	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	 d 	 one 	 	in	the	middle	of	the	week	.
 now 	 a 	 day 	 s 	 	,	congressmen	fly	in	on	tuesday	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	they	do	battle	for	two	 day 	 s 	 	,	then	they	fly	home	thursday	afternoon	.
they	do	n't	move	 the 	 ir 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	to	the	 di 	 strict 	 	.
they	do	n't	meet	each	other	's	 spouse 	 s 	 	or	children	.
there	's	no	more	relationship	there	.
and	 try 	 ing 	 	to	run	congress	 with 	 out 	 	human	 relationship 	 s 	 	is	like	 try 	 ing 	 	to	run	a	car	 with 	 out 	 	motor	oil	.
should	we	be	 surprise 	 d 	 	when	the	whole	thing	 freeze 	 s 	 	up	and	 descend 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 para 	 lysis 	 	and	 polar 	 ization 	 	?
a	simple	change	to	the	 legisl 	 ative 	 	calendar	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	business	stretch	out	for	three	 week 	 s 	 	and	then	they	get	a	week	off	to	go	home	,	that	would	change	the	fundamental	 relationship 	 s 	 	in	congress	.
so	there	's	a	lot	we	can	do	,	but	who	's	going	to	push	them	to	do	it	?
there	are	a	number	of	 group 	 s 	 	that	are	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
no	 label 	 s 	 	and	common	cause	,	i	think	,	have	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 idea 	 s 	 	for	 change 	 s 	 	we	need	to	do	to	make	our	 demo 	 cracy 	 	more	 respons 	 ive 	 	and	our	congress	more	effective	.
but	i	'd	like	to	supplement	 the 	 ir 	 	work	with	a	little	 psycho 	 logical 	 	trick	,	and	the	trick	is	 th 	 is 	 	.
 noth 	 ing 	 	 pull 	 s 	 	people	together	like	a	common	threat	or	a	common	attack	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	an	attack	from	a	foreign	 ene 	 my 	 	,	 un 	 less 	 	of	course	that	threat	 hit 	 s 	 	on	our	 polar 	 ized 	 	 psycho 	 logy 	 	,	in	which	case	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	before	,	it	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	pull	us	 a 	 part 	 	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	a	single	threat	can	polarize	us	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	saw	.
but	what	if	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	we	face	is	not	a	single	threat	but	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	more	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	where	there	's	just	so	much	stuff	coming	in	,	it	's	just	,	``	start	 shoot 	 ing 	 	,	come	on	,	 every 	 body 	 	,	we	've	got	to	just	work	together	,	just	start	 shoot 	 ing 	 	.	``	 be 	 cause 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	we	do	face	 th 	 is 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	where	we	are	 a 	 s 	 	a	country	.
so	here	's	 an 	 other 	 	 a 	 steroid 	 	.
we	've	all	 s 	 een 	 	 version 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	graph	,	right	,	which	 show 	 s 	 	the	 change 	 s 	 	in	wealth	since	1979	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	 al 	 most 	 	all	the	 gain 	 s 	 	in	wealth	have	gone	to	the	top	20	percent	,	and	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	the	top	one	percent	.
 ris 	 ing 	 	 ine 	 quality 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	is	 associate 	 d 	 	with	so	 man 	 y 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	for	a	 demo 	 cracy 	 	.
 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	,	it	 destroy 	 s 	 	our	ability	to	trust	each	other	,	to	feel	that	we	're	all	in	the	same	boat	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	obvious	we	're	not	.
some	of	us	are	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	safe	and	sound	in	 gig 	 antic 	 	private	 yacht 	 s 	 	.
other	people	are	 cl 	 ing 	 ing 	 	to	a	piece	of	driftwood	.
we	're	not	all	in	the	same	boat	,	and	that	 mean 	 s 	 	 no 	 body 	 	's	 will 	 ing 	 	to	sacrifice	for	the	common	good	.
the	left	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 cream 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 steroid 	 	for	30	 year 	 s 	 	now	,	and	the	right	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	huh	,	what	?	hmm	?	no	problem	.	no	problem	.	``	now	,	why	is	that	 happen 	 ing 	 	to	us	?	why	is	the	 ine 	 quality 	 	 ris 	 ing 	 	?
well	,	one	of	the	largest	 cause 	 s 	 	,	after	 global 	 ization 	 	,	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	fourth	 a 	 steroid 	 	,	 ris 	 ing 	 	non	-	marital	 birth 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	graph	 show 	 s 	 	the	 stead 	 y 	 	rise	of	out	-	of	-	 wed 	 lock 	 	 birth 	 s 	 	since	the	1960s	.
most	hispanic	and	black	children	are	now	born	to	 un 	 married 	 	 mother 	 s 	 	.
 white 	 s 	 	are	headed	that	way	too	.
 with 	 in 	 	a	decade	or	two	,	most	american	children	will	be	born	 in 	 to 	 	 home 	 s 	 	with	no	father	.
 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	there	's	much	less	money	coming	 in 	 to 	 	the	house	.
but	it	's	not	just	money	.	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 st 	 ability 	 	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	 cha 	 os 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	know	from	 work 	 ing 	 	with	street	children	in	brazil	,	mom	's	boyfriend	is	often	a	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	person	for	 kid 	 s 	 	.
now	the	right	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 cream 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 steroid 	 	since	the	1960s	,	and	the	left	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	it	's	not	a	problem	.	it	's	not	a	problem	.	``	the	left	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 reluct 	 ant 	 	to	say	that	marriage	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	good	for	women	and	for	children	.
now	let	me	be	clear	.	i	'm	not	 b 	 lam 	 ing 	 	the	women	here	.
i	'm	 actual 	 ly 	 	more	critical	of	the	men	who	wo	n't	take	 respons 	 ibility 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	own	children	and	of	an	economic	system	that	 make 	 s 	 	it	difficult	for	 man 	 y 	 	men	to	earn	 en 	 ough 	 	money	to	support	 t 	 hose 	 	children	.
but	even	if	you	blame	 no 	 body 	 	,	it	still	is	a	national	problem	,	and	one	side	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	more	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	it	than	the	other	.
the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	 final 	 ly 	 	 notice 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 steroid 	 	with	a	front	-	page	story	last	july	 show 	 ing 	 	how	the	decline	of	marriage	 con 	 tribute 	 s 	 	to	 ine 	 quality 	 	.
we	are	 be 	 coming 	 	a	nation	of	just	two	 class 	 es 	 	.
when	americans	go	to	college	and	marry	each	other	,	they	have	 ver 	 y 	 	low	divorce	rates	.
they	earn	a	lot	of	money	,	they	invest	that	money	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	,	some	of	them	 be 	 come 	 	tiger	 mother 	 s 	 	,	the	 kid 	 s 	 	rise	to	 the 	 ir 	 	full	potential	,	and	the	 kid 	 s 	 	go	on	to	 be 	 come 	 	the	top	two	lines	in	 th 	 is 	 	graph	.
and	then	there	's	 every 	 body 	 	else	:	the	children	who	do	n't	benefit	from	a	 s 	 table 	 	marriage	,	who	do	n't	have	 a 	 s 	 	much	 invest 	 ed 	 	in	them	,	who	do	n't	grow	up	in	a	 s 	 table 	 	environment	,	and	who	go	on	to	 be 	 come 	 	the	bottom	three	lines	in	that	graph	.
so	once	 aga 	 in 	 	,	we	see	that	these	two	 graph 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	the	same	thing	.
 a 	 s 	 	before	,	we	've	got	a	problem	,	we	've	got	to	start	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	've	got	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	,	and	what	's	wrong	with	you	people	that	you	do	n't	see	my	threat	?
but	if	 every 	 body 	 	could	just	take	off	 the 	 ir 	 	partisan	blinders	,	we	'd	see	that	these	two	 problem 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	are	best	 address 	 ed 	 	together	.
 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	 re 	 ally 	 	care	about	income	 ine 	 quality 	 	,	you	might	want	to	talk	to	some	 evangel 	 ical 	 	christian	 group 	 s 	 	that	are	 work 	 ing 	 	on	ways	to	promote	marriage	.
but	then	you	're	going	to	run	 s 	 mack 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	problem	that	women	do	n't	 general 	 ly 	 	want	to	marry	 some 	 one 	 	who	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	a	job	.
so	if	you	 re 	 ally 	 	care	about	 strength 	 en 	 ing 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	,	you	might	want	to	talk	to	some	liberal	 group 	 s 	 	who	are	 work 	 ing 	 	on	promoting	 education 	 al 	 	 e 	 quality 	 	,	who	are	 work 	 ing 	 	on	raising	the	 minim 	 um 	 	wage	,	who	are	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 find 	 ing 	 	ways	to	stop	so	 man 	 y 	 	men	from	 be 	 ing 	 	 suck 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	criminal	justice	system	and	taken	out	of	the	marriage	market	for	 the 	 ir 	 	whole	 live 	 s 	 	.
so	to	conclude	,	there	are	at	 l 	 east 	 	four	 a 	 steroid 	 s 	 	headed	our	way	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	can	see	all	four	?
 pleas 	 e 	 	raise	your	hand	right	now	if	you	're	 will 	 ing 	 	to	admit	that	all	four	of	these	are	national	 problem 	 s 	 	.
 pleas 	 e 	 	raise	your	 hand 	 s 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	 al 	 most 	 	all	of	you	.
well	,	 congratula 	 tions 	 	,	you	 guy 	 s 	 	are	the	 inaugu 	 ral 	 	 member 	 s 	 	of	the	 a 	 steroid 	 s 	 	club	,	which	is	a	club	for	all	americans	who	are	 will 	 ing 	 	to	admit	that	the	other	side	 actual 	 ly 	 	might	have	a	point	.
in	the	 a 	 steroid 	 s 	 	club	,	we	do	n't	start	by	looking	for	common	ground	.
common	ground	is	often	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	find	.
no	,	we	start	by	looking	for	common	 threat 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	common	 threat 	 s 	 	make	common	ground	.
now	,	am	i	 be 	 ing 	 	naive	?	is	it	naive	to	think	that	people	could	ever	lay	down	 the 	 ir 	 	 s 	 word 	 s 	 	,	and	left	and	right	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	work	together	?
i	do	n't	think	so	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 happen 	 s 	 	,	not	all	that	often	,	but	there	are	a	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	that	point	the	way	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	we	can	do	.
 be 	 cause 	 	americans	on	both	 side 	 s 	 	care	about	the	decline	in	civility	,	and	they	've	 form 	 ed 	 	 dozen 	 s 	 	of	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	,	at	the	national	level	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	down	to	 man 	 y 	 	local	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	to	the	village	square	in	tallahassee	,	florida	,	which	tries	to	 br 	 ing 	 	state	 lead 	 ers 	 	together	to	help	facilitate	that	sort	of	 work 	 ing 	 	together	human	relationship	that	's	 necess 	 ary 	 	to	solve	florida	's	 problem 	 s 	 	.
americans	on	both	 side 	 s 	 	care	about	global	poverty	and	 aid 	 s 	 	,	and	on	so	 man 	 y 	 	 human 	 itarian 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	,	 liberal 	 s 	 	and	evangelicals	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	natural	 al 	 lies 	 	,	and	at	 time 	 s 	 	they	 re 	 ally 	 	have	 work 	 ed 	 	together	to	solve	these	 problem 	 s 	 	.
and	most	 surprising 	 ly 	 	to	me	,	they	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	can	even	see	eye	to	eye	on	criminal	justice	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	the	 incarce 	 ration 	 	rate	,	the	 pri 	 son 	 	population	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	 ha 	 s 	 	quadrupled	since	1980	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	social	disaster	,	and	 liberal 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
the	southern	poverty	law	center	is	often	 fight 	 ing 	 	the	 pri 	 son 	 	-	industrial	complex	,	 fight 	 ing 	 	to	prevent	a	system	that	's	just	 suck 	 ing 	 	in	more	and	more	poor	young	men	.
but	are	 conserv 	 ative 	 s 	 	happy	about	 th 	 is 	 	?
well	,	grover	norquist	is	n't	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	system	 cost 	 s 	 	an	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	amount	of	money	.
and	so	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 pri 	 son 	 	-	industrial	complex	is	bankrupting	our	 state 	 s 	 	and	corroding	our	 soul 	 s 	 	,	 group 	 s 	 	of	 fisc 	 al 	 	 conserv 	 ative 	 s 	 	and	christian	 conserv 	 ative 	 s 	 	have	come	together	to	form	a	group	 call 	 ed 	 	right	on	crime	.
and	at	 time 	 s 	 	they	have	 work 	 ed 	 	with	the	southern	poverty	law	center	to	 oppos 	 e 	 	the	building	of	new	 pri 	 son 	 s 	 	and	to	work	for	 reform 	 s 	 	that	will	make	the	justice	system	more	efficient	and	more	 human 	 e 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	possible	.	we	can	do	it	.
let	us	 there 	 fore 	 	go	to	battle	 station 	 s 	 	,	not	to	fight	each	other	,	but	to	begin	 deflect 	 ing 	 	these	 in 	 coming 	 	 a 	 steroid 	 s 	 	.
and	let	our	first	mission	be	to	press	congress	to	reform	 it 	 self 	 	,	before	it	's	too	late	for	our	nation	.
thank	you	.
