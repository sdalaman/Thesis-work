for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	i	do	n't	know	if	you	heard	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	a	little	while	ago	in	the	u.s.	there	was	a	muslim	family	 walk 	 ing 	 	down	the	aisle	of	an	 air 	 plane 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	 safe 	 st 	 	place	to	 s 	 it 	 	on	the	plane	.
some	 passenger 	 s 	 	 over 	 heard 	 	them	,	 some 	 how 	 	 mis 	 construe 	 d 	 	that	 a 	 s 	 	terrorist	talk	,	got	them	 kick 	 ed 	 	off	the	plane	.
it	was	a	family	,	a	mother	,	father	,	child	,	 walk 	 ing 	 	down	the	aisle	,	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	 s 	 eating 	 	.	now	 a 	 s 	 	a	middle	eastern	male	,	i	know	there	's	certain	 thing 	 s 	 	i	'm	not	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	say	on	an	 air 	 plane 	 	in	the	u.s.	,	right	?
