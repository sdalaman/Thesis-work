the	kind	of	 neuro 	 science 	 	that	i	do	and	my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	do	is	 al 	 most 	 	like	the	weatherman	.
we	are	 al 	 ways 	 	chasing	 storm 	 s 	 	.
we	want	to	see	and	measure	 storm 	 s 	 	--	 brain 	 storm 	 s 	 	,	that	is	.
and	we	all	talk	about	 brain 	 storm 	 s 	 	in	our	 dai 	 ly 	 	 live 	 s 	 	,	but	we	 rare 	 ly 	 	see	or	listen	to	one	.
so	i	 al 	 ways 	 	like	to	start	these	 talk 	 s 	 	by	 actual 	 ly 	 	 introduc 	 ing 	 	you	to	one	of	them	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	the	first	time	we	 record 	 ed 	 	more	than	one	 neuro 	 n 	 	--	a	hundred	brain	 cell 	 s 	 	 simultaneous 	 ly 	 	--	we	could	measure	the	 electric 	 al 	 	 spark 	 s 	 	of	a	hundred	 cell 	 s 	 	in	the	same	animal	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	image	we	got	,	the	first	10	 second 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 record 	 ing 	 	.
so	we	got	a	little	 snip 	 pet 	 	of	a	thought	,	and	we	could	see	it	in	front	of	us	.
i	 al 	 ways 	 	tell	the	 student 	 s 	 	that	we	could	 al 	 so 	 	call	 neuro 	 scientist 	 s 	 	some	sort	of	astronomer	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	are	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	a	system	that	is	 on 	 ly 	 	 compar 	 able 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	number	of	 cell 	 s 	 	to	the	number	of	 galax 	 ies 	 	that	we	have	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
and	here	we	are	,	out	of	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 neuro 	 ns 	 	,	just	 record 	 ing 	 	,	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	a	hundred	.
we	are	 do 	 ing 	 	a	thousand	now	.
and	we	hope	to	understand	 some 	 thing 	 	fundamental	about	our	human	nature	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	if	you	do	n't	know	yet	,	 every 	 thing 	 	that	we	use	to	define	what	human	nature	is	 come 	 s 	 	from	these	 storm 	 s 	 	,	 come 	 s 	 	from	these	 storm 	 s 	 	that	roll	over	the	 hill 	 s 	 	and	 val 	 ley 	 s 	 	of	our	 brain 	 s 	 	and	define	our	 memor 	 ies 	 	,	our	 belief 	 s 	 	,	our	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	our	 plan 	 s 	 	for	the	future	.
 every 	 thing 	 	that	we	ever	do	,	 every 	 thing 	 	that	every	human	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	 d 	 one 	 	,	do	or	will	do	,	 requir 	 es 	 	the	toil	of	 population 	 s 	 	of	 neuro 	 ns 	 	producing	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 storm 	 s 	 	.
and	the	sound	of	a	 brain 	 storm 	 	,	if	you	've	never	heard	one	,	is	 some 	 what 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
you	can	put	it	 loud 	 er 	 	if	you	can	.
my	son	 call 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	``	making	 pop 	 corn 	 	while	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	a	 bad 	 ly 	 	-	tuned	 a.m 	 . 	 	station	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	brain	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	you	route	these	 electric 	 al 	 	 storm 	 s 	 	to	a	 loud 	 speaker 	 	and	you	listen	to	a	hundred	brain	 cell 	 s 	 	 fir 	 ing 	 	,	your	brain	will	sound	like	 th 	 is 	 	--	my	brain	,	any	brain	.
and	what	we	want	to	do	 a 	 s 	 	 neuro 	 scientist 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	time	is	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	listen	to	these	 sym 	 phon 	 ies 	 	,	these	brain	 sym 	 phon 	 ies 	 	,	and	try	to	 ex 	 tract 	 	from	them	the	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	they	carry	.
in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	about	12	 year 	 s 	 	ago	we	 create 	 d 	 	a	 pre 	 par 	 ation 	 	that	we	named	brain	-	machine	 inter 	 face 	 s 	 	.
and	you	have	a	scheme	here	that	 de 	 scribe 	 s 	 	how	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
the	idea	is	,	let	's	have	some	 sensor 	 s 	 	that	listen	to	these	 storm 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 electric 	 al 	 	 fir 	 ing 	 	,	and	see	if	you	can	,	in	the	same	time	that	it	 take 	 s 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	storm	to	 leav 	 e 	 	the	brain	and	reach	the	 leg 	 s 	 	or	the	 arm 	 s 	 	of	an	animal	--	about	half	a	second	--	let	's	see	if	we	can	read	these	 signal 	 s 	 	,	 ex 	 tract 	 	the	motor	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	that	are	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	in	it	,	 transl 	 ate 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	digital	 command 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 end 	 	it	to	an	artificial	 de 	 vice 	 	that	will	 re 	 produce 	 	the	voluntary	motor	wheel	of	that	brain	in	real	time	.
and	see	if	we	can	measure	how	well	we	can	 transl 	 ate 	 	that	 mess 	 age 	 	when	we	 compar 	 e 	 	to	the	way	the	body	 do 	 es 	 	that	.
and	if	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	provide	 feed 	 back 	 	,	 sensor 	 y 	 	 signal 	 s 	 	that	go	back	from	 th 	 is 	 	robotic	,	 mechanic 	 al 	 	,	 computation 	 al 	 	actuator	that	is	now	under	the	control	of	the	brain	,	back	to	the	brain	,	how	the	brain	 deal 	 s 	 	with	that	,	of	 receiv 	 ing 	 	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	from	an	artificial	piece	of	 machine 	 ry 	 	.
and	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	we	did	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
we	 start 	 ed 	 	with	a	 super 	 star 	 	monkey	 call 	 ed 	 	aurora	that	 be 	 came 	 	one	of	the	 super 	 star 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	field	.
and	aurora	 like 	 d 	 	to	play	video	 game 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	here	,	she	 like 	 s 	 	to	use	a	 joy 	 stick 	 	,	like	any	one	of	us	,	any	of	our	 kid 	 s 	 	,	to	play	 th 	 is 	 	game	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	a	good	 prim 	 ate 	 	,	she	even	tries	to	cheat	before	she	 get 	 s 	 	the	right	answer	.
so	even	before	a	target	 appear 	 s 	 	that	she	's	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	cross	with	the	cursor	that	she	's	 controll 	 ing 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	 joy 	 stick 	 	,	aurora	is	 try 	 ing 	 	to	find	the	target	,	no	matter	where	it	is	.
and	if	she	's	 do 	 ing 	 	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	every	time	she	 cross 	 es 	 	that	target	with	the	little	cursor	,	she	 get 	 s 	 	a	drop	of	brazilian	 o 	 range 	 	juice	.
and	i	can	tell	you	,	any	monkey	will	do	 any 	 thing 	 	for	you	if	you	get	a	little	drop	of	brazilian	 o 	 range 	 	juice	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	any	 prim 	 ate 	 	will	do	that	.
think	about	that	.
well	,	while	aurora	was	 play 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	game	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	saw	,	and	 do 	 ing 	 	a	thousand	 trial 	 s 	 	a	day	and	 get 	 ting 	 	97	percent	correct	and	350	milliliters	of	 o 	 range 	 	juice	,	we	are	 record 	 ing 	 	the	 brain 	 storm 	 s 	 	that	are	 produce 	 d 	 	in	her	head	and	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	them	to	a	robotic	arm	that	was	 learn 	 ing 	 	to	 re 	 produce 	 	the	 move 	 ments 	 	that	aurora	was	making	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	idea	was	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	turn	on	 th 	 is 	 	brain	-	machine	 inter 	 face 	 	and	have	aurora	play	the	game	just	by	 think 	 ing 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	 inter 	 ference 	 	of	her	body	.
her	 brain 	 storm 	 s 	 	would	control	an	arm	that	would	move	the	cursor	and	cross	the	target	.
and	to	our	shock	,	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	aurora	did	.
she	 play 	 ed 	 	the	game	 with 	 out 	 	moving	her	body	.
so	every	 tra 	 ject 	 ory 	 	that	you	see	of	the	cursor	now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	exact	first	moment	she	got	that	.
that	's	the	exact	first	moment	a	brain	 intent 	 ion 	 	was	 liberate 	 d 	 	from	the	physical	 domain 	 s 	 	of	a	body	of	a	 prim 	 ate 	 	and	could	act	 out 	 side 	 	,	in	that	 out 	 side 	 	world	,	just	by	 controll 	 ing 	 	an	artificial	 de 	 vice 	 	.
and	aurora	 ke 	 pt 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	the	game	,	 ke 	 pt 	 	 find 	 ing 	 	the	little	target	and	 get 	 ting 	 	the	 o 	 range 	 	juice	that	she	 want 	 ed 	 	to	get	,	that	she	craved	for	.
well	,	she	did	that	 be 	 cause 	 	she	,	at	that	time	,	had	 acquir 	 ed 	 	a	new	arm	.
the	robotic	arm	that	you	see	moving	here	30	 day 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	after	the	first	video	that	i	 show 	 ed 	 	to	you	,	is	under	the	control	of	aurora	's	brain	and	is	moving	the	cursor	to	get	to	the	target	.
and	aurora	now	 know 	 s 	 	that	she	can	play	the	game	with	 th 	 is 	 	robotic	arm	,	but	she	 ha 	 s 	 	not	lost	the	ability	to	use	her	 bio 	 logical 	 	 arm 	 s 	 	to	do	what	she	 pleas 	 es 	 	.
she	can	scratch	her	back	,	she	can	scratch	one	of	us	,	she	can	play	 an 	 other 	 	game	.
by	all	 purpose 	 s 	 	and	 mean 	 s 	 	,	aurora	's	brain	 ha 	 s 	 	 incorpo 	 rated 	 	that	artificial	 de 	 vice 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	 extens 	 ion 	 	of	her	body	.
the	model	of	the	self	that	aurora	had	in	her	mind	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 expand 	 ed 	 	to	get	one	more	arm	.
well	,	we	did	that	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
just	fast	forward	10	 year 	 s 	 	.
just	last	year	we	 real 	 ized 	 	that	you	do	n't	even	need	to	have	a	robotic	 de 	 vice 	 	.
you	can	just	build	a	 computation 	 al 	 	body	,	an	avatar	,	a	monkey	avatar	.
and	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	use	it	for	our	 monkey 	 s 	 	to	either	interact	with	them	,	or	you	can	train	them	to	 assum 	 e 	 	in	a	virtual	world	the	first	-	person	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	of	that	avatar	and	use	her	brain	activity	to	control	the	 move 	 ments 	 	of	the	avatar	's	 arm 	 s 	 	or	 leg 	 s 	 	.
and	what	we	did	 bas 	 ically 	 	was	to	train	the	 animal 	 s 	 	to	learn	how	to	control	these	 avatar 	 s 	 	and	explore	 object 	 s 	 	that	appear	in	the	virtual	world	.
and	these	 object 	 s 	 	are	 visual 	 ly 	 	 ident 	 ical 	 	,	but	when	the	avatar	 cross 	 es 	 	the	surface	of	these	 object 	 s 	 	,	they	 s 	 end 	 	an	 electric 	 al 	 	 mess 	 age 	 	that	is	 proportion 	 al 	 	to	the	microtactile	 text 	 ure 	 	of	the	object	that	 go 	 es 	 	back	 direct 	 ly 	 	to	the	monkey	's	brain	,	 inform 	 ing 	 	the	brain	what	it	is	the	avatar	is	 touch 	 ing 	 	.
and	in	just	four	 week 	 s 	 	,	the	brain	 learn 	 s 	 	to	process	 th 	 is 	 	new	 sens 	 ation 	 	and	 acquir 	 es 	 	a	new	 sensor 	 y 	 	 path 	 way 	 	--	like	a	new	sense	.
and	you	 tru 	 ly 	 	liberate	the	brain	now	 be 	 cause 	 	you	are	 allow 	 ing 	 	the	brain	to	 s 	 end 	 	motor	 command 	 s 	 	to	move	 th 	 is 	 	avatar	.
and	the	 feed 	 back 	 	that	 come 	 s 	 	from	the	avatar	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 process 	 ed 	 	 direct 	 ly 	 	by	the	brain	 with 	 out 	 	the	 inter 	 ference 	 	of	the	skin	.
so	what	you	see	here	is	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	design	of	the	task	.
you	're	going	to	see	an	animal	 bas 	 ically 	 	 touch 	 ing 	 	these	three	 target 	 s 	 	.
and	he	 ha 	 s 	 	to	select	one	 be 	 cause 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	one	 car 	 ries 	 	the	reward	,	the	 o 	 range 	 	juice	that	they	want	to	get	.
and	he	 ha 	 s 	 	to	select	it	by	touch	using	a	virtual	arm	,	an	arm	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	exist	.
and	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	they	do	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	complete	 liber 	 ation 	 	of	the	brain	from	the	physical	 constraint 	 s 	 	of	the	body	and	the	motor	in	a	 per 	 cept 	 ual 	 	task	.
the	animal	is	 controll 	 ing 	 	the	avatar	to	touch	the	 target 	 s 	 	.
and	he	's	 sens 	 ing 	 	the	 text 	 ure 	 	by	 receiv 	 ing 	 	an	 electric 	 al 	 	 mess 	 age 	 	 direct 	 ly 	 	in	the	brain	.
and	the	brain	is	 dec 	 id 	 ing 	 	what	is	the	 text 	 ure 	 	 associate 	 d 	 	with	the	reward	.
the	 legend 	 s 	 	that	you	see	in	the	movie	do	n't	appear	for	the	monkey	.
and	by	the	way	,	they	do	n't	read	english	 any 	 way 	 	,	so	they	are	here	just	for	you	to	know	that	the	correct	target	is	shifting	position	.
and	yet	,	they	can	find	them	by	 tact 	 ile 	 	 discrimi 	 nation 	 	,	and	they	can	press	it	and	select	it	.
so	when	we	look	at	the	 brain 	 s 	 	of	these	 animal 	 s 	 	,	on	the	top	 pan 	 el 	 	you	see	the	 align 	 ment 	 	of	125	 cell 	 s 	 	 show 	 ing 	 	what	 happen 	 s 	 	with	the	brain	activity	,	the	 electric 	 al 	 	 storm 	 s 	 	,	of	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 ample 	 	of	 neuro 	 ns 	 	in	the	brain	when	the	animal	is	using	a	 joy 	 stick 	 	.
and	that	's	a	picture	that	every	neurophysiologist	 know 	 s 	 	.
the	 bas 	 ic 	 	 align 	 ment 	 	 show 	 s 	 	that	these	 cell 	 s 	 	are	 cod 	 ing 	 	for	all	possible	 direction 	 s 	 	.
the	bottom	picture	is	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	the	body	 stop 	 s 	 	moving	and	the	animal	 start 	 s 	 	 controll 	 ing 	 	either	a	robotic	 de 	 vice 	 	or	a	 computation 	 al 	 	avatar	.
 a 	 s 	 	fast	 a 	 s 	 	we	can	 re 	 set 	 	our	 computer 	 s 	 	,	the	brain	activity	 shift 	 s 	 	to	start	 represent 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	new	tool	,	 a 	 s 	 	if	 th 	 is 	 	too	was	a	part	of	that	 prim 	 ate 	 	's	body	.
the	brain	is	assimilating	that	too	,	 a 	 s 	 	fast	 a 	 s 	 	we	can	measure	.
so	that	 suggest 	 s 	 	to	us	that	our	sense	of	self	 do 	 es 	 	not	end	at	the	last	layer	of	the	epithelium	of	our	bodies	,	but	it	 end 	 s 	 	at	the	last	layer	of	 electron 	 s 	 	of	the	 tool 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 command 	 ing 	 	with	our	 brain 	 s 	 	.
our	 viol 	 in 	 s 	 	,	our	 car 	 s 	 	,	our	 bi 	 cycle 	 s 	 	,	our	soccer	 ball 	 s 	 	,	our	 cloth 	 ing 	 	--	they	all	 be 	 come 	 	assimilated	by	 th 	 is 	 	 vor 	 acious 	 	,	 amaz 	 ing 	 	,	dynamic	system	 call 	 ed 	 	the	brain	.
how	far	can	we	take	it	?
well	,	in	an	experiment	that	we	ran	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	we	took	 th 	 is 	 	to	the	limit	.
we	had	an	animal	running	on	a	 tread 	 mill 	 	at	 du 	 ke 	 	university	on	the	east	coast	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	producing	the	 brain 	 storm 	 s 	 	 necess 	 ary 	 	to	move	.
and	we	had	a	robotic	 de 	 vice 	 	,	a	 human 	 oid 	 	robot	,	in	kyoto	,	japan	at	atr	 labor 	 ator 	 ies 	 	that	was	 dream 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	entire	life	to	be	controlled	by	a	brain	,	a	human	brain	,	or	a	 prim 	 ate 	 	brain	.
what	 happen 	 s 	 	here	is	that	the	brain	activity	that	generated	the	 move 	 ments 	 	in	the	monkey	was	 transmit 	 ted 	 	to	japan	and	made	 th 	 is 	 	robot	walk	while	 foot 	 age 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 walk 	 ing 	 	was	 s 	 ent 	 	back	to	 du 	 ke 	 	,	so	that	the	monkey	could	see	the	 leg 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	robot	 walk 	 ing 	 	in	front	of	her	.
so	she	could	be	 reward 	 ed 	 	,	not	by	what	her	body	was	 do 	 ing 	 	but	for	every	correct	step	of	the	robot	on	the	other	side	of	the	planet	controlled	by	her	brain	activity	.
funny	thing	,	that	round	trip	around	the	 glob 	 e 	 	took	20	 milli 	 second 	 s 	 	less	than	it	 take 	 s 	 	for	that	 brain 	 storm 	 	to	 leav 	 e 	 	 it 	 s 	 	head	,	the	head	of	the	monkey	,	and	reach	 it 	 s 	 	own	muscle	.
the	monkey	was	moving	a	robot	that	was	six	 time 	 s 	 	 big 	 ger 	 	,	 a 	 cross 	 	the	planet	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	 experiment 	 s 	 	in	which	that	robot	was	able	to	walk	 autonomous 	 ly 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	cb	1	 fulfill 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	dream	in	japan	under	the	control	of	the	brain	activity	of	a	 prim 	 ate 	 	.
so	where	are	we	taking	all	 th 	 is 	 	?
what	are	we	going	to	do	with	all	 th 	 is 	 	research	,	 be 	 side 	 s 	 	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	the	 proper 	 ties 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	dynamic	 uni 	 verse 	 	that	we	have	between	our	 ear 	 s 	 	?
well	the	idea	is	to	take	all	 th 	 is 	 	knowledge	and	technology	and	try	to	 re 	 store 	 	one	of	the	most	severe	 neuro 	 logical 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	that	we	have	in	the	world	.
 million 	 s 	 	of	people	have	lost	the	ability	to	 transl 	 ate 	 	these	 brain 	 storm 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	action	,	 in 	 to 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	.
 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 brain 	 s 	 	 continu 	 e 	 	to	produce	 t 	 hose 	 	 storm 	 s 	 	and	code	for	 move 	 ments 	 	,	they	can	not	cross	a	 bar 	 rier 	 	that	was	 create 	 d 	 	by	a	 les 	 ion 	 	on	the	 spin 	 al 	 	cord	.
so	our	idea	is	to	create	a	bypass	,	is	to	use	these	brain	-	machine	 inter 	 face 	 s 	 	to	read	these	 signal 	 s 	 	,	 large 	 r 	 	-	scale	 brain 	 storm 	 s 	 	that	contain	the	 desir 	 e 	 	to	move	 aga 	 in 	 	,	bypass	the	 les 	 ion 	 	using	 computation 	 al 	 	microengineering	and	 s 	 end 	 	it	to	a	new	body	,	a	whole	body	 call 	 ed 	 	an	exoskeleton	,	a	whole	robotic	suit	that	will	 be 	 come 	 	the	new	body	of	these	 patient 	 s 	 	.
and	you	can	see	an	image	 produce 	 d 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 sort 	 ium 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 non 	 profit 	 	 con 	 sort 	 ium 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	walk	 aga 	 in 	 	project	that	is	 put 	 ting 	 	together	 scientist 	 s 	 	from	europe	,	from	here	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	and	in	brazil	together	to	work	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	 th 	 is 	 	new	body	built	--	a	body	that	we	 believ 	 e 	 	,	through	the	same	plastic	 mechan 	 ism 	 s 	 	that	allow	aurora	and	other	 monkey 	 s 	 	to	use	these	 tool 	 s 	 	through	a	brain	-	machine	 inter 	 face 	 	and	that	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	 in 	 corporate 	 	the	 tool 	 s 	 	that	we	produce	and	use	in	our	 dai 	 ly 	 	life	.
 th 	 is 	 	same	 mechan 	 ism 	 	,	we	hope	,	will	allow	these	 patient 	 s 	 	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	to	imagine	 aga 	 in 	 	the	 move 	 ments 	 	that	they	want	to	make	and	 transl 	 ate 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	 move 	 ments 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	new	body	,	but	for	 th 	 is 	 	body	to	be	assimilated	 a 	 s 	 	the	new	body	that	the	brain	 control 	 s 	 	.
so	i	was	told	about	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	that	 th 	 is 	 	would	never	happen	,	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	close	to	 im 	 possible 	 	.
and	i	can	 on 	 ly 	 	tell	you	that	 a 	 s 	 	a	scientist	,	i	grew	up	in	southern	brazil	in	the	mid	-	'60s	 watch 	 ing 	 	a	few	crazy	 guy 	 s 	 	 tell 	 ing 	 	[	us	]	that	they	would	go	to	the	moon	.
and	i	was	five	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	and	i	never	 under 	 stood 	 	why	nasa	did	n't	hire	 cap 	 tain 	 	kirk	and	spock	to	do	the	job	;	after	all	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 profici 	 ent 	 	--	but	just	 see 	 ing 	 	that	 a 	 s 	 	a	kid	made	me	 believ 	 e 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	my	 grand 	 mother 	 	used	to	tell	me	,	that	``	 im 	 possible 	 	is	just	the	possible	that	 some 	 one 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	not	put	in	 en 	 ough 	 	effort	to	make	it	come	true	.	``	so	they	told	me	that	it	's	 im 	 possible 	 	to	make	 some 	 one 	 	walk	.
i	think	i	'm	going	to	follow	my	 grand 	 mother 	 	's	 ad 	 vice 	 	.
