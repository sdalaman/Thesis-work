 organ 	 ic 	 	 chemist 	 s 	 	make	 molecule 	 s 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	 molecule 	 s 	 	,	by	 chop 	 ping 	 	up	a	big	molecule	 in 	 to 	 	small	 molecule 	 s 	 	and	reverse	 engineer 	 ing 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	a	chemist	,	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	ask	my	research	group	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	is	,	could	we	make	a	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	universal	 chemist 	 ry 	 	set	?
in	 es 	 s 	 ence 	 	,	could	we	``	app	``	 chemist 	 ry 	 	?
now	what	would	 th 	 is 	 	mean	,	and	how	would	we	do	it	?
we	took	a	3d	 print 	 er 	 	and	we	 start 	 ed 	 	to	print	our	 beak 	 ers 	 	and	our	test	 tube 	 s 	 	on	one	side	and	then	print	the	molecule	at	the	same	time	on	the	other	side	and	combine	them	together	in	what	we	call	 re 	 action 	 ware 	 	.
and	so	by	 print 	 ing 	 	the	vessel	and	 do 	 ing 	 	the	 chemist 	 ry 	 	at	the	same	time	,	we	may	start	to	access	 th 	 is 	 	universal	 tool 	 kit 	 	of	 chemist 	 ry 	 	.
now	what	could	 th 	 is 	 	mean	?
well	if	we	can	embed	 bio 	 logical 	 	and	chemical	 network 	 s 	 	like	a	search	engine	,	so	if	you	have	a	cell	that	's	ill	that	you	need	to	cure	or	bacteria	that	you	want	to	kill	,	if	you	have	 th 	 is 	 	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	in	your	 de 	 vice 	 	at	the	same	time	,	and	you	do	the	 chemist 	 ry 	 	,	you	may	be	able	to	make	 drug 	 s 	 	in	a	new	way	.	so	how	are	we	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	lab	?
well	it	 requir 	 es 	 	 soft 	 ware 	 	,	it	 requir 	 es 	 	 hard 	 ware 	 	and	it	 requir 	 es 	 	chemical	 ink 	 s 	 	.
and	so	the	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	bit	is	,	the	idea	is	that	we	want	to	have	a	universal	set	of	 ink 	 s 	 	that	we	put	out	with	the	 print 	 er 	 	,	and	you	download	the	 blue 	 print 	 	,	the	 organ 	 ic 	 	 chemist 	 ry 	 	for	that	molecule	and	you	make	it	in	the	 de 	 vice 	 	.
and	so	you	can	make	your	molecule	in	the	 print 	 er 	 	using	 th 	 is 	 	 soft 	 ware 	 	.
so	what	could	 th 	 is 	 	mean	?
well	,	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	it	could	mean	that	you	could	print	your	own	medicine	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	in	the	lab	at	the	moment	.	but	to	take	baby	 step 	 s 	 	to	get	there	,	first	of	all	we	want	to	look	at	drug	design	and	production	,	or	drug	 discover 	 y 	 	and	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	if	we	can	 manufactur 	 e 	 	it	after	we	've	 discover 	 ed 	 	it	,	we	could	deploy	it	 any 	 where 	 	.
you	do	n't	need	to	go	to	the	chemist	 any 	 more 	 	.
we	can	print	 drug 	 s 	 	at	point	of	need	.
we	can	download	new	 diagnos 	 tics 	 	.
say	a	new	super	bug	 ha 	 s 	 	 emerge 	 d 	 	.
you	put	it	in	your	search	engine	,	and	you	create	the	drug	to	treat	the	threat	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 allow 	 s 	 	you	on	-	the	-	fly	 mole 	 cular 	 	 assem 	 bly 	 	.
but	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	for	me	the	core	bit	going	 in 	 to 	 	the	future	is	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	taking	your	own	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	,	with	your	 gene 	 s 	 	and	your	environment	,	and	you	print	your	own	personal	medicine	.
and	if	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	seem	 fanci 	 ful 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	where	do	you	think	we	're	going	to	go	?
well	,	you	're	going	to	have	your	own	personal	matter	 fabric 	 ator 	 	.
