 every 	 thing 	 	is	 cover 	 ed 	 	in	 in 	 visible 	 	 eco 	 system 	 s 	 	made	of	 tin 	 y 	 	 life 	 form 	 s 	 	:	bacteria	,	viruses	and	fungi	.
our	 desk 	 s 	 	,	our	 computer 	 s 	 	,	our	 pencil 	 s 	 	,	our	 building 	 s 	 	all	harbor	resident	 micro 	 bi 	 al 	 	 land 	 scapes 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	we	design	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	we	could	be	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 design 	 ing 	 	these	 in 	 visible 	 	 world 	 s 	 	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	how	they	interact	with	our	personal	 eco 	 system 	 s 	 	.
our	bodies	are	home	to	 trillion 	 s 	 	of	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	,	and	these	 creature 	 s 	 	define	who	we	are	.
the	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	in	your	gut	can	influence	your	weight	and	your	 mood 	 s 	 	.	the	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	on	your	skin	can	help	boost	your	 immun 	 e 	 	system	.
the	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	in	your	mouth	can	 fresh 	 en 	 	your	breath	,	or	not	,	and	the	key	thing	is	that	our	personal	 eco 	 system 	 s 	 	interact	with	 eco 	 system 	 s 	 	on	 every 	 thing 	 	we	touch	.
so	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	when	you	touch	a	pencil	,	 micro 	 bi 	 al 	 	 ex 	 change 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	.
if	we	can	design	the	 in 	 visible 	 	 eco 	 system 	 s 	 	in	our	 surround 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 open 	 s 	 	a	path	to	 in 	 flu 	 encing 	 	our	health	in	unprecedented	ways	.
i	get	 ask 	 ed 	 	all	of	the	time	from	people	,	``	is	it	possible	to	 re 	 ally 	 	design	 micro 	 bi 	 al 	 	 eco 	 system 	 s 	 	?	``
and	i	 believ 	 e 	 	the	answer	is	 y 	 es 	 	.
i	think	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	right	now	,	but	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	 un 	 conscious 	 ly 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	share	data	with	you	from	one	 a 	 spect 	 	of	my	research	focused	on	 architect 	 ure 	 	that	 demonst 	 rates 	 	how	,	through	both	conscious	and	 un 	 conscious 	 	design	,	we	're	 impact 	 ing 	 	these	 in 	 visible 	 	 world 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	lillis	business	complex	at	the	university	of	oregon	,	and	i	 work 	 ed 	 	with	a	team	of	 architect 	 s 	 	and	 biologist 	 s 	 	to	 s 	 ample 	 	over	300	rooms	in	 th 	 is 	 	building	.
we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	get	 some 	 thing 	 	like	a	fossil	record	of	the	building	,	and	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	 s 	 ampl 	 ed 	 	dust	.
from	the	dust	,	we	 pull 	 ed 	 	out	bacterial	 cell 	 s 	 	,	broke	them	open	,	and	 compar 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	gene	 sequence 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	people	in	my	group	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	 vacuum 	 ing 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	project	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	of	tim	,	who	,	right	when	i	 snap 	 ped 	 	 th 	 is 	 	picture	,	 re 	 minded 	 	me	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	jessica	,	the	last	lab	group	i	 work 	 ed 	 	in	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	 field 	 work 	 	in	the	costa	rican	 rain 	 forest 	 	,	and	 thing 	 s 	 	have	 change 	 d 	 	 dramat 	 ically 	 	for	me	.	``
so	i	'm	going	to	show	you	now	first	what	we	found	in	the	 off 	 ice 	 s 	 	,	and	we	're	going	to	look	at	the	data	through	a	 visual 	 ization 	 	tool	that	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	in	 partner 	 ship 	 	with	autodesk	.
the	way	that	you	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	data	is	,	first	,	look	around	the	 out 	 side 	 	of	the	circle	.
you	'll	see	broad	bacterial	 group 	 s 	 	,	and	if	you	look	at	the	shape	of	 th 	 is 	 	pink	lobe	,	it	 tell 	 s 	 	you	 some 	 thing 	 	about	the	 relat 	 ive 	 	abundance	of	each	group	.
so	at	12	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	,	you	'll	see	that	 off 	 ice 	 s 	 	have	a	lot	of	alphaproteobacteria	,	and	at	one	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	you	'll	see	that	bacilli	are	 relat 	 ively 	 	rare	.
let	's	take	a	look	at	what	's	going	on	in	different	space	 type 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	building	.
if	you	look	 in 	 side 	 	the	restrooms	,	they	all	have	 re 	 ally 	 	similar	 eco 	 system 	 s 	 	,	and	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	to	look	 in 	 side 	 	the	 class 	 rooms 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 al 	 so 	 	have	similar	 eco 	 system 	 s 	 	.
but	if	you	look	 a 	 cross 	 	these	space	 type 	 s 	 	,	you	can	see	that	they	're	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	different	from	one	 an 	 other 	 	.
i	like	to	think	of	 bath 	 rooms 	 	like	a	 tropic 	 al 	 	 rain 	 forest 	 	.
i	told	tim	,	``	if	you	could	just	see	the	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	,	it	's	kind	of	like	 be 	 ing 	 	in	costa	rica	.	kind	of	.	``
and	i	 al 	 so 	 	like	to	think	of	 off 	 ice 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 temper 	 ate 	 	 grass 	 land 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	is	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	one	for	 design 	 ers 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	can	 br 	 ing 	 	on	 principle 	 s 	 	of	 eco 	 logy 	 	,	and	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	principle	of	 eco 	 logy 	 	is	 dispers 	 al 	 	,	the	way	 organism 	 s 	 	move	around	.
we	know	that	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	are	 dispers 	 ed 	 	around	by	people	and	by	air	.
so	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	thing	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	in	 th 	 is 	 	building	was	look	at	the	air	system	.
 mechanic 	 al 	 	 engineer 	 s 	 	design	air	 hand 	 ling 	 	 unit 	 s 	 	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	people	are	 comfort 	 able 	 	,	that	the	air	flow	and	temperature	is	just	right	.
they	do	 th 	 is 	 	using	 principle 	 s 	 	of	physics	and	 chemist 	 ry 	 	,	but	they	could	 al 	 so 	 	be	using	biology	.
if	you	look	at	the	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	in	one	of	the	air	 hand 	 ling 	 	 unit 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	building	,	you	'll	see	that	they	're	all	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	to	one	 an 	 other 	 	.
and	if	you	 compar 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	to	the	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	in	a	different	air	 hand 	 ling 	 	unit	,	you	'll	see	that	they	're	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	different	.
the	rooms	in	 th 	 is 	 	building	are	like	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	in	an	 arch 	 ipelago 	 	,	and	what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	is	that	 mechanic 	 al 	 	 engineer 	 s 	 	are	like	eco	-	 engineer 	 s 	 	,	and	they	have	the	ability	to	structure	biomes	in	 th 	 is 	 	building	the	way	that	they	want	to	.
 an 	 other 	 	facet	of	how	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	get	around	is	by	people	,	and	 design 	 ers 	 	often	cluster	rooms	together	to	facilitate	 interact 	 ions 	 	among	people	,	or	the	sharing	of	 idea 	 s 	 	,	like	in	 lab 	 s 	 	and	in	 off 	 ice 	 s 	 	.
 give 	 n 	 	that	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	travel	around	with	people	,	you	might	expect	to	see	rooms	that	are	close	together	have	 re 	 ally 	 	similar	biomes	.
and	that	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	we	found	.
if	you	look	at	 class 	 rooms 	 	right	 ad 	 ja 	 cent 	 	to	one	 an 	 other 	 	,	they	have	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	 eco 	 system 	 s 	 	,	but	if	you	go	to	an	 off 	 ice 	 	that	is	a	 far 	 ther 	 	 walk 	 ing 	 	distance	away	,	the	 eco 	 system 	 	is	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	different	.
and	when	i	see	the	power	that	 dispers 	 al 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	on	these	 bio 	 geo 	 graphic 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	,	it	 make 	 s 	 	me	think	that	it	's	possible	to	tackle	 re 	 ally 	 	 challeng 	 ing 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	,	like	hospital	-	 acquir 	 ed 	 	 infect 	 ions 	 	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	got	to	be	,	in	part	,	a	building	 eco 	 logy 	 	problem	.
all	right	,	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	one	more	story	about	 th 	 is 	 	building	.
i	am	 collabor 	 ating 	 	with	charlie	 brow 	 n 	 	.
he	's	an	architect	,	and	charlie	is	 deep 	 ly 	 	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	global	climate	change	.
he	's	 dedicate 	 d 	 	his	life	to	 sustain 	 able 	 	design	.
when	he	met	me	and	 real 	 ized 	 	that	it	was	possible	for	him	to	 stud 	 y 	 	in	a	 quant 	 itative 	 	way	how	his	design	 choice 	 s 	 	 impact 	 ed 	 	the	 eco 	 logy 	 	and	biology	of	 th 	 is 	 	building	,	he	got	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 add 	 ed 	 	a	new	dimension	to	what	he	did	.
he	went	from	 think 	 ing 	 	just	about	energy	to	 al 	 so 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	to	think	about	human	health	.
he	 help 	 ed 	 	design	some	of	the	air	 hand 	 ling 	 	 system 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	building	and	the	way	it	was	 ventil 	 ated 	 	.
so	what	i	'm	first	going	to	show	you	is	air	that	we	 s 	 ampl 	 ed 	 	 out 	 side 	 	of	the	building	.
what	you	're	looking	at	is	a	signature	of	bacterial	 commun 	 ities 	 	in	the	 out 	 door 	 	air	,	and	how	they	vary	over	time	.
next	i	'm	going	to	show	you	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	when	we	 experiment 	 ally 	 	 manipul 	 ated 	 	 class 	 rooms 	 	.
we	 block 	 ed 	 	them	off	at	night	so	that	they	got	no	 ventil 	 ation 	 	.
a	lot	of	 building 	 s 	 	are	 oper 	 ated 	 	 th 	 is 	 	way	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	where	you	work	,	and	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	do	 th 	 is 	 	to	 s 	 ave 	 	money	on	 the 	 ir 	 	energy	bill	.
what	we	found	is	that	these	rooms	 remain 	 ed 	 	 relat 	 ively 	 	 stag 	 nant 	 	 un 	 til 	 	saturday	,	when	we	 open 	 ed 	 	the	 vent 	 s 	 	up	 aga 	 in 	 	.
when	you	 walk 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	rooms	,	they	 smell 	 ed 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	,	and	our	data	 suggest 	 s 	 	that	it	had	 some 	 thing 	 	to	do	with	 leav 	 ing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	the	 air 	 borne 	 	bacterial	soup	from	people	the	day	before	.
contrast	 th 	 is 	 	to	rooms	that	 we 	 re 	 	designed	using	a	 sustain 	 able 	 	 pass 	 ive 	 	design	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	where	air	came	in	from	the	 out 	 side 	 	through	louvers	.
in	these	rooms	,	the	air	 track 	 ed 	 	the	 out 	 door 	 	air	 relat 	 ively 	 	well	,	and	when	charlie	saw	 th 	 is 	 	,	he	got	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	.
he	felt	like	he	had	made	a	good	choice	with	the	design	process	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	both	energy	efficient	and	it	 wash 	 ed 	 	away	the	building	's	resident	 micro 	 bi 	 al 	 	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	.
the	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	that	i	just	 g 	 ave 	 	you	are	about	 architect 	 ure 	 	,	but	they	're	relevant	to	the	design	of	 any 	 thing 	 	.
imagine	 design 	 ing 	 	with	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	that	we	want	in	a	plane	or	on	a	phone	.
there	's	a	new	 micro 	 be 	 	,	i	just	 discover 	 ed 	 	it	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	blis	,	and	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 show 	 n 	 	to	both	ward	off	 pathogen 	 s 	 	and	give	you	good	breath	.
would	n't	it	be	awesome	if	we	all	had	blis	on	our	 phone 	 s 	 	?
a	conscious	approach	to	design	,	i	'm	 call 	 ing 	 	it	bioinformed	design	,	and	i	think	it	's	possible	.
thank	you	.
