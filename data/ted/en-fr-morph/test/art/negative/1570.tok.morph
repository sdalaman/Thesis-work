so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	 grand 	 father 	 	,	salman	schocken	,	who	was	born	 in 	 to 	 	a	poor	and	 un 	 educated 	 	family	with	six	children	to	feed	,	and	when	he	was	14	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	he	was	 force 	 d 	 	to	drop	out	of	school	in	order	to	help	put	bread	on	the	table	.	he	never	went	back	to	school	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	he	went	on	to	build	a	glittering	empire	of	 depart 	 ment 	 	 store 	 s 	 	.
salman	was	the	 consum 	 mate 	 	 perfect 	 ion 	 ist 	 	,	and	every	one	of	his	 store 	 s 	 	was	a	jewel	of	bauhaus	 architect 	 ure 	 	.
he	was	 al 	 so 	 	the	ultimate	self	-	 learn 	 er 	 	,	and	like	 every 	 thing 	 	else	,	he	did	it	in	grand	style	.
he	 surround 	 ed 	 	 him 	 self 	 	with	an	entourage	of	young	,	 un 	 known 	 	 scholar 	 s 	 	like	martin	buber	and	shai	agnon	and	franz	kafka	,	and	he	paid	each	one	of	them	a	 month 	 ly 	 	 s 	 al 	 ary 	 	so	that	they	could	write	in	peace	.
and	yet	,	in	the	late	'30s	,	salman	saw	what	's	coming	.
he	 fl 	 ed 	 	germany	,	together	with	his	family	,	 leav 	 ing 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	else	 be 	 hind 	 	.
his	 depart 	 ment 	 	 store 	 s 	 	 confisc 	 ated 	 	,	he	 s 	 pent 	 	the	rest	of	his	life	in	a	 relent 	 less 	 	 pur 	 suit 	 	of	art	and	culture	.	 th 	 is 	 	high	school	 drop 	 out 	 	 di 	 ed 	 	at	the	age	of	82	,	a	 for 	 mid 	 able 	 	intellectual	,	 co 	 founder 	 	and	first	ceo	of	the	hebrew	university	of	jerusalem	,	and	founder	of	schocken	 book 	 s 	 	,	an	acclaimed	 im 	 print 	 	that	was	 lat 	 er 	 	 acquir 	 ed 	 	by	random	house	.
 s 	 uch 	 	is	the	power	of	self	-	 stud 	 y 	 	.
and	these	are	my	 parent 	 s 	 	.
they	too	did	not	enjoy	the	privilege	of	college	education	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	too	 bus 	 y 	 	building	a	family	and	a	country	.
and	yet	,	just	like	salman	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 life 	 long 	 	,	 ten 	 acious 	 	self	-	 learn 	 ers 	 	,	and	our	home	was	 stack 	 ed 	 	with	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 book 	 s 	 	,	 record 	 s 	 	and	 art 	 work 	 	.
i	remember	 quit 	 e 	 	 vivi 	 d 	 ly 	 	my	father	 tell 	 ing 	 	me	that	when	 every 	 one 	 	in	the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	will	have	a	tv	set	,	then	we	'll	buy	a	normal	f.m	.	radio	.
and	that	's	me	,	i	was	going	to	say	 hold 	 ing 	 	my	first	abacus	,	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	 hold 	 ing 	 	what	my	father	would	consider	an	ample	 substitut 	 e 	 	to	an	ipad	.
so	one	thing	that	i	took	from	home	is	 th 	 is 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	that	 educ 	 ators 	 	do	n't	 necess 	 arily 	 	have	to	teach	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	they	can	provide	an	environment	and	 resource 	 s 	 	that	 teas 	 e 	 	out	your	natural	ability	to	learn	on	your	own	.
self	-	 stud 	 y 	 	,	self	-	exploration	,	self	-	 empower 	 ment 	 	:	these	are	the	 virtue 	 s 	 	of	a	great	education	.
so	i	'd	like	to	share	with	you	a	story	about	a	self	-	 stud 	 y 	 	,	self	-	 empower 	 ing 	 	computer	science	course	that	i	built	,	together	with	my	 brilli 	 ant 	 	 col 	 league 	 	noam	nisan	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	from	the	 picture 	 s 	 	,	both	noam	and	i	had	an	early	 fasci 	 nation 	 	with	first	 principle 	 s 	 	,	and	over	the	 year 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	our	knowledge	of	science	and	technology	 be 	 came 	 	more	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	early	awe	with	the	 bas 	 ic 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 intens 	 ified 	 	.
so	it	's	not	surprising	that	,	about	12	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	when	noam	and	i	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	computer	science	 professor 	 s 	 	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 equal 	 ly 	 	 frust 	 rated 	 	by	the	same	 phenomen 	 on 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	 be 	 came 	 	 increasing 	 ly 	 	more	complex	,	our	 student 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	the	forest	for	the	 tree 	 s 	 	,	and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	it	is	 im 	 possible 	 	to	connect	with	the	soul	of	the	machine	if	you	interact	with	a	black	box	p.c	.	or	a	mac	which	is	 shroud 	 ed 	 	by	 nume 	 r 	 ous 	 	 layer 	 s 	 	of	closed	,	 prop 	 riet 	 ary 	 	 soft 	 ware 	 	.
so	noam	and	i	had	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 sight 	 	that	if	we	want	our	 student 	 s 	 	to	understand	how	 computer 	 s 	 	work	,	and	understand	it	in	the	 mar 	 row 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 bone 	 s 	 	,	then	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	the	best	way	to	go	about	it	is	to	have	them	build	a	complete	,	 work 	 ing 	 	,	general	-	purpose	,	 use 	 ful 	 	computer	,	 hard 	 ware 	 	and	 soft 	 ware 	 	,	from	the	ground	up	,	from	first	 principle 	 s 	 	.
now	,	we	had	to	start	 some 	 where 	 	,	and	so	noam	and	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	base	our	 cat 	 hedral 	 	,	so	to	speak	,	on	the	 simpl 	 est 	 	possible	building	block	,	which	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	nand	.
it	is	 noth 	 ing 	 	more	than	a	trivial	logic	gate	with	four	 in 	 put 	 	-	 out 	 put 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
so	we	now	start	 th 	 is 	 	journey	by	 tell 	 ing 	 	our	 student 	 s 	 	that	god	 g 	 ave 	 	us	nand	--	--	and	told	us	to	build	a	computer	,	and	when	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	how	,	god	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	one	step	at	a	time	.	``	and	then	,	 follow 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 ad 	 vice 	 	,	we	start	with	 th 	 is 	 	 low 	 ly 	 	,	humble	nand	gate	,	and	we	walk	our	 student 	 s 	 	through	an	elaborate	sequence	of	 project 	 s 	 	in	which	they	 gradu 	 ally 	 	build	a	chip	set	,	a	 hard 	 ware 	 	platform	,	an	 assemble 	 r 	 	,	a	virtual	machine	,	a	 bas 	 ic 	 	 oper 	 ating 	 	system	and	a	 compil 	 er 	 	for	a	simple	,	java	-	like	language	that	we	call	``	jack	.	``
the	 student 	 s 	 	 celebr 	 ate 	 	the	end	of	 th 	 is 	 	tour	de	force	by	using	jack	to	write	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	cool	 game 	 s 	 	like	pong	,	snake	and	tetris	.
you	can	imagine	the	tremendous	joy	of	 play 	 ing 	 	with	a	tetris	game	that	you	wrote	in	jack	and	then	 compil 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	machine	language	in	a	 compil 	 er 	 	that	you	wrote	 al 	 so 	 	,	and	then	 see 	 ing 	 	the	result	running	on	a	machine	that	you	built	 start 	 ing 	 	with	 noth 	 ing 	 	more	than	a	few	thousand	nand	 gate 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	tremendous	personal	triumph	of	going	from	first	 principle 	 s 	 	all	the	way	to	a	 fantastic 	 ally 	 	complex	and	 use 	 ful 	 	system	.
noam	and	i	 work 	 ed 	 	five	 year 	 s 	 	to	facilitate	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 cent 	 	and	to	create	the	 tool 	 s 	 	and	 infra 	 structure 	 	that	will	 en 	 able 	 	 student 	 s 	 	to	build	it	in	one	semester	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	great	team	that	 help 	 ed 	 	us	make	it	happen	.	the	trick	was	to	 de 	 compose 	 	the	computer	's	construction	 in 	 to 	 	 nume 	 r 	 ous 	 	stand	-	 al 	 one 	 	 modul 	 es 	 	,	each	of	which	could	be	 individual 	 ly 	 	 spec 	 ified 	 	,	built	and	unit	-	tested	in	 isol 	 ation 	 	from	the	rest	of	the	project	.
and	from	day	one	,	noam	and	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	put	all	these	building	 block 	 s 	 	 free 	 ly 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	in	open	source	on	the	web	.
so	chip	 specific 	 ations 	 	,	apis	,	project	 de 	 script 	 ions 	 	,	 soft 	 ware 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	,	 hard 	 ware 	 	 simul 	 ators 	 	,	cpu	 emul 	 ators 	 	,	 stack 	 s 	 	of	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 slide 	 s 	 	,	 lectur 	 es 	 	--	we	laid	out	 every 	 thing 	 	on	the	web	and	 invit 	 ed 	 	the	world	to	come	over	,	take	 what 	 ever 	 	they	need	,	and	do	 what 	 ever 	 	they	want	with	it	.
and	then	 some 	 thing 	 	 fasci 	 nating 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
the	world	came	.
and	in	short	order	,	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	 we 	 re 	 	building	our	machine	.
and	nand	2tetris	 be 	 came 	 	one	of	the	first	massive	,	open	,	 on 	 line 	 	 course 	 s 	 	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	seven	 year 	 s 	 	ago	we	had	no	idea	that	what	we	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	moocs	.
we	just	 observ 	 ed 	 	how	self	-	 organize 	 d 	 	 course 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	kind	of	 spontane 	 ously 	 	 spawn 	 ing 	 	out	of	our	 material 	 s 	 	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	pramode	c.e	.	,	an	engineer	from	kerala	,	india	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 organize 	 d 	 	 group 	 s 	 	of	self	-	 learn 	 ers 	 	who	build	our	computer	under	his	good	 gui 	 dance 	 	.

the	people	who	are	 attract 	 ed 	 	to	these	 course 	 s 	 	 typical 	 ly 	 	have	a	 hack 	 er 	 	 ment 	 ality 	 	.
they	want	to	figure	out	how	 thing 	 s 	 	work	,	and	they	want	to	do	it	in	 group 	 s 	 	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	 hack 	 ers 	 	club	in	washington	,	d.c.	,	that	uses	our	 material 	 s 	 	to	 off 	 er 	 	community	 course 	 s 	 	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	these	 material 	 s 	 	are	 wide 	 ly 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	and	open	-	source	,	different	people	take	them	to	 ver 	 y 	 	different	and	 un 	 predict 	 able 	 	 direction 	 s 	 	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	yu	fangmin	,	from	guangzhou	,	 ha 	 s 	 	used	fpga	technology	to	build	our	computer	and	show	 other 	 s 	 	how	to	do	the	same	using	a	video	clip	,	and	ben	craddock	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	nice	computer	game	that	 un 	 fold 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	our	cpu	 architect 	 ure 	 	,	which	is	 quit 	 e 	 	a	complex	3d	maze	that	ben	 develop 	 ed 	 	using	the	minecraft	3d	 simul 	 ator 	 	engine	.
the	minecraft	community	went	 banana 	 s 	 	over	 th 	 is 	 	project	,	and	ben	 be 	 came 	 	an	instant	media	 celebr 	 ity 	 	.
and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	for	 quit 	 e 	 	a	few	people	,	taking	 th 	 is 	 	nand	2tetris	 pil 	 grim 	 age 	 	,	if	you	will	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	life	-	changing	experience	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	take	dan	 round 	 s 	 	,	who	is	a	music	and	math	major	from	east	lansing	,	michigan	.
a	few	 week 	 s 	 	ago	,	dan	 post 	 ed 	 	a	 vict 	 or 	 ious 	 	post	on	our	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	and	i	'd	like	to	read	it	to	you	.
so	here	's	what	dan	 s 	 aid 	 	.
``	i	did	the	 course 	 work 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 understand 	 ing 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	is	 import 	 ant 	 	to	me	,	just	like	 liter 	 acy 	 	and	numeracy	,	and	i	made	it	through	.	i	never	 work 	 ed 	 	 hard 	 er 	 	on	 any 	 thing 	 	,	never	 be 	 en 	 	 challeng 	 ed 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	degree	.
but	 give 	 n 	 	what	i	now	feel	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 do 	 ing 	 	,	i	would	 certain 	 ly 	 	do	it	 aga 	 in 	 	.
to	 any 	 one 	 	 consider 	 ing 	 	nand	2tetris	,	it	's	a	tough	journey	,	but	you	'll	be	 pro 	 found 	 ly 	 	 change 	 d 	 	.	``
so	dan	 demonst 	 rates 	 	the	 man 	 y 	 	self	-	 learn 	 ers 	 	who	take	 th 	 is 	 	course	off	the	web	,	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 tract 	 ion 	 	,	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 initi 	 ative 	 	,	and	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	these	people	can	not	care	less	about	 grade 	 s 	 	.
they	are	 do 	 ing 	 	it	 be 	 cause 	 	of	one	 motiv 	 ation 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	.
they	have	a	tremendous	 pass 	 ion 	 	to	learn	.
and	with	that	in	mind	,	i	'd	like	to	say	a	few	 word 	 s 	 	about	 tradition 	 al 	 	college	 grad 	 ing 	 	.
i	'm	sick	of	it	.
we	are	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	 grade 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	are	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	data	,	and	yet	 grad 	 ing 	 	 take 	 s 	 	away	all	the	 f 	 un 	 	from	 fail 	 ing 	 	,	and	a	huge	part	of	education	is	about	 fail 	 ing 	 	.
courage	,	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	churchill	,	is	the	ability	to	go	from	one	defeat	to	 an 	 other 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	 ent 	 husiasm 	 	.
and	[	joyce	]	 s 	 aid 	 	that	 mistak 	 es 	 	are	the	 port 	 al 	 s 	 	of	 discover 	 y 	 	.
and	yet	we	do	n't	 toler 	 ate 	 	 mistak 	 es 	 	,	and	we	worship	 grade 	 s 	 	.
so	we	collect	your	b	 plus 	 es 	 	and	your	a	 minus 	 es 	 	and	we	 aggreg 	 ate 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	a	number	like	3.4	,	which	is	 s 	 tamped 	 	on	your	 fore 	 head 	 	and	 sum 	 s 	 	up	who	you	are	.
well	,	in	my	opinion	,	we	went	too	far	with	 th 	 is 	 	 non 	 sense 	 	,	and	 grad 	 ing 	 	 be 	 came 	 	 de 	 grad 	 ing 	 	.
so	with	that	,	i	'd	like	to	say	a	few	 word 	 s 	 	about	 up 	 grad 	 ing 	 	,	and	share	with	you	a	 glimps 	 e 	 	from	my	current	project	,	which	is	different	from	the	previous	one	,	but	it	 share 	 s 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	of	self	-	 learn 	 ing 	 	,	 learn 	 ing 	 	by	 do 	 ing 	 	,	self	-	exploration	and	community	-	building	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	project	 deal 	 s 	 	with	k	-	12	math	education	,	 begin 	 ning 	 	with	early	age	math	,	and	we	do	it	on	 table 	 ts 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 believ 	 e 	 	that	math	,	like	 any 	 thing 	 	else	,	should	be	taught	 hand 	 s 	 	on	.
so	here	's	what	we	do	.	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	we	 develop 	 ed 	 	 nume 	 r 	 ous 	 	mobile	 app 	 s 	 	,	every	one	of	them	 explain 	 ing 	 	a	 part 	 icular 	 	 con 	 cept 	 	in	math	.
so	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	let	's	take	area	.
when	you	deal	with	a	 con 	 cept 	 	like	area	--	well	,	we	 al 	 so 	 	provide	a	set	of	 tool 	 s 	 	that	the	child	is	 invit 	 ed 	 	to	experiment	with	in	order	to	learn	.
so	if	area	is	what	 interest 	 s 	 	us	,	then	one	thing	which	is	natural	to	do	is	to	tile	the	area	of	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	shape	and	 simpl 	 y 	 	count	how	 man 	 y 	 	 tile 	 s 	 	it	 take 	 s 	 	to	cover	it	 complete 	 ly 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	little	 exercis 	 e 	 	here	 give 	 s 	 	you	a	first	good	 in 	 sight 	 	of	the	 not 	 ion 	 	of	area	.
moving	 a 	 long 	 	,	what	about	the	area	of	 th 	 is 	 	figure	?
well	,	if	you	try	to	tile	it	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	too	well	,	 do 	 es 	 	it	.
so	 in 	 stead 	 	,	you	can	experiment	with	these	different	 tool 	 s 	 	here	by	some	process	of	 guide 	 d 	 	trial	and	error	,	and	at	some	point	you	will	discover	that	one	thing	that	you	can	do	among	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	legitimate	 transform 	 ations 	 	is	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	one	.	you	can	cut	the	figure	,	you	can	 re 	 arrange 	 	the	 part 	 s 	 	,	you	can	glue	them	and	then	proceed	to	tile	just	like	we	did	before	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	 transform 	 ation 	 	did	not	change	the	area	of	the	original	figure	,	so	a	six	-	year	-	old	who	 play 	 s 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	just	 discover 	 ed 	 	a	clever	algorithm	to	compute	the	area	of	any	 give 	 n 	 	 parallel 	 ogram 	 	.
we	do	n't	replace	 teacher 	 s 	 	,	by	the	way	.
we	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 teacher 	 s 	 	should	be	 empower 	 ed 	 	,	not	 replace 	 d 	 	.
moving	 a 	 long 	 	,	what	about	the	area	of	a	triangle	?
so	after	some	 guide 	 d 	 	trial	and	error	,	the	child	will	discover	,	with	or	 with 	 out 	 	help	,	that	he	or	she	can	 duplic 	 ate 	 	the	original	figure	and	then	take	the	result	,	 trans 	 pose 	 	it	,	glue	it	to	the	original	and	then	proceed	[	with	]	what	we	did	before	:	cut	,	 re 	 arrange 	 	,	paste	--	 oop 	 s 	 	--	paste	and	glue	,	and	tile	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	 transform 	 ation 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 double 	 d 	 	the	area	of	the	original	figure	,	and	 there 	 fore 	 	we	have	just	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	the	area	of	the	triangle	 equal 	 s 	 	the	area	of	 th 	 is 	 	 rect 	 angle 	 	 divid 	 ed 	 	by	two	.
but	we	 discover 	 ed 	 	it	by	self	-	exploration	.
so	,	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	 learn 	 ing 	 	some	 use 	 ful 	 	 geo 	 metry 	 	,	the	child	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	to	some	 pre 	 tty 	 	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	science	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	,	like	 r 	 eduction 	 	,	which	is	the	art	of	 transform 	 ing 	 	a	complex	problem	 in 	 to 	 	a	simple	one	,	or	 general 	 ization 	 	,	which	is	at	the	heart	of	any	scientific	discipline	,	or	the	fact	that	some	 proper 	 ties 	 	are	invariant	under	some	 transform 	 ations 	 	.
and	all	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	a	 ver 	 y 	 	young	child	can	pick	up	using	 s 	 uch 	 	mobile	 app 	 s 	 	.
so	 present 	 ly 	 	,	we	are	 do 	 ing 	 	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	:	first	of	all	,	we	are	 de 	 com 	 posing 	 	the	k	-	12	math	curriculum	 in 	 to 	 	 nume 	 r 	 ous 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 app 	 s 	 	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	we	can	not	do	it	on	our	own	,	we	've	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 f 	 ancy 	 	 author 	 ing 	 	tool	that	any	author	,	any	parent	or	 actual 	 ly 	 	 any 	 one 	 	who	 ha 	 s 	 	an	interest	in	math	education	,	can	use	 th 	 is 	 	 author 	 ing 	 	tool	to	develop	similar	 app 	 s 	 	on	 table 	 ts 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 programm 	 ing 	 	.
