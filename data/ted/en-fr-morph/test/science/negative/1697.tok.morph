in	1991	i	had	 may 	 be 	 	the	most	 pro 	 found 	 	and	 transform 	 ative 	 	experience	of	my	life	.
i	was	in	the	third	year	of	my	seven	-	year	 under 	 graduate 	 	degree	.
i	took	a	couple	 vict 	 ory 	 	 lap 	 s 	 	in	there	.
and	i	was	on	a	college	choir	tour	up	in	 north 	 ern 	 	california	,	and	we	had	 stop 	 ped 	 	for	the	day	after	all	day	on	the	bus	,	and	we	 we 	 re 	 	 relax 	 ing 	 	next	to	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 idy 	 llic 	 	lake	in	the	 mountain 	 s 	 	.
and	there	 we 	 re 	 	 cricket 	 s 	 	and	 bird 	 s 	 	and	 frog 	 s 	 	making	noise	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	we	 s 	 at 	 	there	,	over	the	 mountain 	 s 	 	coming	in
from	the	north	 we 	 re 	 	these	steven	spielbergian	 cloud 	 s 	 	 roll 	 ing 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	us	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	the	 cloud 	 s 	 	got	about	 half 	 way 	 	over	the	 val 	 ley 	 	,	so	help	me	god	,	every	single	animal	in	that	place	 stop 	 ped 	 	making	noise	at	the	same	time	.
 th 	 is 	 	electric	hush	,	 a 	 s 	 	if	they	could	sense	what	was	about	to	happen	.
and	then	the	 cloud 	 s 	 	came	over	us	,	and	then	,	boom	!	 th 	 is 	 	massive	 thunder 	 clap 	 	,	and	 sheet 	 s 	 	of	rain	.
it	was	just	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	,	and	when	i	came	back	home	i	found	a	poem	by	the	mexican	poet	octavio	paz	,	and	 decide 	 d 	 	to	set	it	to	music	,	a	piece	for	choir	 call 	 ed 	 	``	cloudburst	,	``	which	is	the	piece	that	we	'll	perform	for	you	in	just	a	moment	.
now	fast	forward	to	just	three	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	we	released	to	youtube	 th 	 is 	 	,	the	virtual	choir	project	,	185	 s 	 ing 	 ers 	 	from	12	different	 count 	 ries 	 	.
you	can	see	my	little	video	there	 conduct 	 ing 	 	these	people	,	 al 	 one 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	dorm	rooms	or	in	 the 	 ir 	 	living	rooms	at	home	.
two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	on	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	stage	,	we	 premiere 	 d 	 	virtual	choir	2	,	2,052	 s 	 ing 	 ers 	 	from	58	different	 count 	 ries 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	time	 perform 	 ing 	 	a	piece	that	i	had	written	 call 	 ed 	 	``	sleep	.	``
and	then	just	last	spring	we	released	virtual	choir	3	,	``	water	night	,	``	 an 	 other 	 	piece	that	i	had	written	,	 th 	 is 	 	time	 near 	 ly 	 	4,000	 s 	 ing 	 ers 	 	from	73	different	 count 	 ries 	 	.
and	when	i	was	 s 	 peaking 	 	to	chris	about	the	future	of	virtual	choir	and	where	we	might	be	able	to	take	 th 	 is 	 	,	he	 challeng 	 ed 	 	me	to	push	the	technology	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	we	possibly	could	.
could	we	do	 th 	 is 	 	all	in	real	time	?
could	we	have	people	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	together	in	real	time	?
and	with	the	help	of	skype	,	that	is	what	we	are	going	to	attempt	 to 	 day 	 	.
now	,	we	'll	perform	``	cloudburst	``	for	you	.
the	first	half	will	be	 perform 	 ed 	 	by	the	live	 s 	 ing 	 ers 	 	here	on	stage	.
i	'm	 join 	 ed 	 	by	 s 	 ing 	 ers 	 	from	cal	state	long	beach	,	cal	state	fullerton	and	 river 	 side 	 	community	college	,	some	of	the	best	amateur	 choir 	 s 	 	in	the	country	,	and	--	--	and	in	the	second	half	of	the	piece	,	the	virtual	choir	will	join	us	,	30	different	 s 	 ing 	 ers 	 	from	30	different	 count 	 ries 	 	.
now	,	we	've	 push 	 ed 	 	the	technology	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	it	can	go	,	but	there	's	still	less	than	a	second	of	 lat 	 ency 	 	,	but	in	musical	 term 	 s 	 	,	that	's	a	 life 	 time 	 	.
we	deal	in	 milli 	 second 	 s 	 	.
so	what	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	is	,	i	've	 adapt 	 ed 	 	``	cloudburst	``	so	that	it	 embrace 	 s 	 	the	 lat 	 ency 	 	and	the	 perform 	 ers 	 	 s 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 lat 	 ency 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 try 	 ing 	 	to	be	 exact 	 ly 	 	together	.
so	with	deep	 humil 	 ity 	 	,	and	for	your	approval	,	we	present	``	cloudburst	.	``
