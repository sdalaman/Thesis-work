there	's	a	group	of	people	in	kenya	.
people	cross	 ocean 	 s 	 	to	go	see	them	.
these	people	are	tall	.
they	jump	high	.	they	wear	red	.
and	they	kill	 lion 	 s 	 	.
you	might	be	 wonder 	 ing 	 	,	who	are	these	people	?
these	are	the	maasais	.
and	you	know	what	's	cool	?	i	'm	 actual 	 ly 	 	one	of	them	.
the	maasais	,	the	 boy 	 s 	 	are	 br 	 ought 	 	up	to	be	 warrior 	 s 	 	.
the	 girl 	 s 	 	are	 br 	 ought 	 	up	to	be	 mother 	 s 	 	.
when	i	was	five	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	i	found	out	that	i	was	 engag 	 ed 	 	to	be	married	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	i	 reach 	 ed 	 	puberty	.
my	mother	,	my	 grand 	 mother 	 	,	my	 aunt 	 ies 	 	,	they	 constant 	 ly 	 	 re 	 minded 	 	me	that	your	husband	just	 pass 	 ed 	 	by	.
cool	,	 yea 	 h 	 	?
and	 every 	 thing 	 	i	had	to	do	from	that	moment	was	to	 prep 	 are 	 	me	to	be	a	perfect	woman	at	age	12	.
my	day	 start 	 ed 	 	at	5	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	 milk 	 ing 	 	the	 cow 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 weep 	 ing 	 	the	house	,	 cook 	 ing 	 	for	my	 s 	 i 	 bling 	 s 	 	,	 collect 	 ing 	 	water	,	 fire 	 wood 	 	.
i	did	 every 	 thing 	 	that	i	 need 	 ed 	 	to	do	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	perfect	wife	.
i	went	to	school	not	 be 	 cause 	 	the	maasais	'	women	or	 girl 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	school	.
it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	my	mother	was	 deni 	 ed 	 	an	education	,	and	she	 constant 	 ly 	 	 re 	 minded 	 	me	and	my	 s 	 i 	 bling 	 s 	 	that	she	never	 want 	 ed 	 	us	to	live	the	life	she	was	living	.
why	did	she	say	that	?
my	father	 work 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 police 	 man 	 	in	the	city	.
he	came	home	once	a	year	.
we	did	n't	see	him	for	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	even	two	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	 when 	 ever 	 	he	came	home	,	it	was	a	different	case	.	my	mother	 work 	 ed 	 	hard	in	the	farm	to	grow	 crop 	 s 	 	so	that	we	can	eat	.
she	 rear 	 ed 	 	the	 cow 	 s 	 	and	the	 goat 	 s 	 	so	that	she	can	care	for	us	.
but	when	my	father	came	,	he	would	sell	the	 cow 	 s 	 	,	he	would	sell	the	 product 	 s 	 	we	had	,	and	he	went	and	 d 	 rank 	 	with	his	 friend 	 s 	 	in	the	 bar 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	my	mother	was	a	woman	,	she	was	not	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	own	any	 proper 	 ty 	 	,	and	by	default	,	 every 	 thing 	 	in	my	family	 any 	 way 	 	 belong 	 s 	 	to	my	father	,	so	he	had	the	right	.
and	if	my	mother	ever	 question 	 ed 	 	him	,	he	beat	her	,	 abuse 	 d 	 	her	,	and	 re 	 ally 	 	it	was	difficult	.
when	i	went	to	school	,	i	had	a	dream	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	teacher	.
 teacher 	 s 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	nice	.
they	wear	nice	 dress 	 es 	 	,	high	-	heeled	 shoe 	 s 	 	.
i	found	out	 lat 	 er 	 	that	they	are	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	,	but	i	 admire 	 d 	 	it	.
but	most	of	all	,	the	teacher	was	just	writing	on	the	board	--	not	hard	work	,	that	's	what	i	thought	,	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	what	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	in	the	farm	.
so	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	teacher	.
i	 work 	 ed 	 	hard	in	school	,	but	when	i	was	in	eighth	grade	,	it	was	a	 determi 	 ning 	 	factor	.
in	our	tradition	,	there	is	a	 ce 	 re 	 mon 	 y 	 	that	 girl 	 s 	 	have	to	 under 	 go 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	women	,	and	it	's	a	rite	of	 pass 	 age 	 	to	 woman 	 hood 	 	.
and	then	i	was	just	 finish 	 ing 	 	my	eighth	grade	,	and	that	was	a	 transit 	 ion 	 	for	me	to	go	to	high	school	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	the	 cross 	 road 	 	.
once	i	go	through	 th 	 is 	 	tradition	,	i	was	going	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	wife	.
well	,	my	dream	of	 be 	 coming 	 	a	teacher	will	not	come	to	pass	.
so	i	 talk 	 ed 	 	--	i	had	to	come	up	with	a	plan	to	figure	these	 thing 	 s 	 	out	.
i	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	my	father	.	i	did	 some 	 thing 	 	that	most	 girl 	 s 	 	have	never	 d 	 one 	 	.
i	told	my	father	,	``	i	will	 on 	 ly 	 	go	through	 th 	 is 	 	 ce 	 re 	 mon 	 y 	 	if	you	let	me	go	back	to	school	.	``
the	reason	why	,	if	i	ran	away	,	my	father	will	have	a	stigma	,	people	will	be	 call 	 ing 	 	him	the	father	of	that	girl	who	did	n't	go	through	the	 ce 	 re 	 mon 	 y 	 	.
it	was	a	 shame 	 ful 	 	thing	for	him	to	carry	the	rest	of	his	life	.
so	he	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	.	``	well	,	``	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,
you	'll	go	to	school	after	the	 ce 	 re 	 mon 	 y 	 	.	``
i	did	.	the	 ce 	 re 	 mon 	 y 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
it	's	a	whole	week	long	of	 excit 	 ement 	 	.
it	's	a	 ce 	 re 	 mon 	 y 	 	.	people	are	 enjoy 	 ing 	 	it	.
and	the	day	before	the	actual	 ce 	 re 	 mon 	 y 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 danc 	 ing 	 	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	 excit 	 ement 	 	,	and	through	all	the	night	we	did	not	sleep	.
the	actual	day	came	,	and	we	 walk 	 ed 	 	out	of	the	house	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 danc 	 ing 	 	in	.	 y 	 es 	 	,	we	 danc 	 ed 	 	and	 danc 	 ed 	 	.
we	 walk 	 ed 	 	out	to	the	 court 	 yard 	 	,	and	there	 we 	 re 	 	a	bunch	of	people	 wait 	 ing 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	all	in	a	circle	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	we	 danc 	 ed 	 	and	 danc 	 ed 	 	,	and	we	 approach 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	circle	of	women	,	men	,	women	,	children	,	 every 	 body 	 	was	there	.
there	was	a	woman	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	the	middle	of	it	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	woman	was	 wait 	 ing 	 	to	hold	us	.	i	was	the	first	.	there	 we 	 re 	 	my	 sister 	 s 	 	and	a	couple	of	other	 girl 	 s 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	i	 approach 	 ed 	 	her	,	she	 look 	 ed 	 	at	me	,	and	i	 s 	 at 	 	down	.
and	i	 s 	 at 	 	down	,	and	i	 open 	 ed 	 	my	 leg 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	 open 	 ed 	 	my	leg	,	 an 	 other 	 	woman	came	,
and	 th 	 is 	 	woman	was	 carry 	 ing 	 	a	knife	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	she	carried	the	knife	,	she	 walk 	 ed 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	me	and	she	held	the	clitoris	,	and	she	cut	it	off	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	can	imagine	,	i	bled	.	i	bled	.
after	 ble 	 ed 	 ing 	 	for	a	while	,	i	 faint 	 ed 	 	 there 	 after 	 	.
it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	so	 man 	 y 	 	 girl 	 s 	 	--	i	'm	 luck 	 y 	 	,	i	never	 di 	 ed 	 	--	but	 man 	 y 	 	die	.
it	's	 practice 	 d 	 	,	it	's	no	 an 	 est 	 hesia 	 	,	it	's	a	 rust 	 y 	 	old	knife	,	and	it	was	difficult	.
i	was	 luck 	 y 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	one	,	 al 	 so 	 	,	my	mom	did	 some 	 thing 	 	that	most	women	do	n't	do	.
three	 day 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	after	 every 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	left	the	home	,	my	mom	went	and	 br 	 ought 	 	a	nurse	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	taken	care	of	.
three	 week 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	i	was	 heal 	 ed 	 	,	and	i	was	back	in	high	school	.
i	was	so	 determine 	 d 	 	to	be	a	teacher	now	so	that	i	could	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	my	family	.
well	,	while	i	was	in	high	school	,	 some 	 thing 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
i	met	a	young	 gentle 	 man 	 	from	our	village	who	had	 be 	 en 	 	to	the	university	of	oregon	.
 th 	 is 	 	man	was	 wear 	 ing 	 	a	white	t	-	shirt	,	 jean 	 s 	 	,	camera	,	white	 sneak 	 ers 	 	--	and	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	white	 sneak 	 ers 	 	.
there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	about	 clothe 	 s 	 	,	i	think	,	and	 shoe 	 s 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 sneak 	 ers 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	in	a	village	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	even	have	 pav 	 ed 	 	 road 	 s 	 	.	it	was	 quit 	 e 	 	 attract 	 ive 	 	.
i	told	him	,	``	well	,	i	want	to	go	to	where	you	are	,	``	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	man	 look 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	,	and	i	 admire 	 d 	 	that	.
and	he	told	me	,	``	well	,	what	do	you	mean	,	you	want	to	go	?
do	n't	you	have	a	husband	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	you	?	``
and	i	told	him	,	``	do	n't	worry	about	that	part	.
just	tell	me	how	to	get	there	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	 gentle 	 man 	 	,	he	 help 	 ed 	 	me	.
while	i	was	in	high	school	 al 	 so 	 	,	my	dad	was	sick	.
he	got	a	stroke	,	and	he	was	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	sick	,	so	he	 re 	 ally 	 	could	n't	tell	me	what	to	do	next	.
but	the	problem	is	,	my	father	is	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	father	i	have	.
 every 	 body 	 	who	is	my	dad	's	age	,	male	in	the	community	,	is	my	father	by	default	--	my	 uncle 	 s 	 	,	all	of	them	--	and	they	 dict 	 ate 	 	what	my	future	is	.
so	the	news	came	,	i	 appli 	 ed 	 	to	school	and	i	was	 accept 	 ed 	 	to	randolph	-	macon	woman	's	college	in	lynchburg	,	virginia	,	and	i	could	n't	come	 with 	 out 	 	the	support	of	the	village	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 need 	 ed 	 	to	raise	money	to	buy	the	air	ticket	.
i	got	a	 scholar 	 ship 	 	but	i	 need 	 ed 	 	to	get	 my 	 self 	 	here	.
but	i	 need 	 ed 	 	the	support	of	the	village	,	and	here	 aga 	 in 	 	,	when	the	men	heard	,	and	the	people	heard	that	a	woman	had	gotten	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	go	to	school	,	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	a	lost	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	should	have	 be 	 en 	 	 give 	 n 	 	to	a	boy	.	we	ca	n't	do	 th 	 is 	 	.	``
so	i	went	back	and	i	had	to	go	back	to	the	tradition	.
there	's	a	belief	among	our	people	that	 morn 	 ing 	 	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	good	news	.
so	i	had	to	come	up	with	 some 	 thing 	 	to	do	with	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	good	news	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
and	in	the	village	 al 	 so 	 	,	there	is	one	chief	,	an	elder	,	who	if	he	 say 	 s 	 	 y 	 es 	 	,	 every 	 body 	 	will	follow	him	.
so	i	went	to	him	 ver 	 y 	 	early	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	 s 	 un 	 	rose	.
the	first	thing	he	 s 	 ees 	 	when	he	 open 	 s 	 	his	door	is	,	it	's	me	.
``	my	child	,	what	are	you	 do 	 ing 	 	here	?	``
``	well	,	dad	,	i	need	help	.	can	you	support	me	to	go	to	america	?	``
i	 promise 	 d 	 	him	that	i	would	be	the	best	girl	,	i	will	come	back	,	 any 	 thing 	 	they	 want 	 ed 	 	after	that	,	i	will	do	it	for	them	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	but	i	ca	n't	do	it	 al 	 one 	 	.	``
he	 g 	 ave 	 	me	a	list	of	 an 	 other 	 	15	men	that	i	went	--	16	more	men	--	every	single	 morn 	 ing 	 	i	went	and	 visit 	 ed 	 	them	.
they	all	came	together	.
the	village	,	the	women	,	the	men	,	 every 	 body 	 	came	together	to	support	me	to	come	to	get	an	education	.
i	 arriv 	 ed 	 	in	america	.	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	imagine	,	what	did	i	find	?
i	found	snow	!
i	found	wal	-	marts	,	vacuum	 clean 	 ers 	 	,	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	food	in	the	cafeteria	.
i	was	in	a	land	of	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	.
i	 enjoy 	 ed 	 	 my 	 self 	 	,	but	 dur 	 ing 	 	that	moment	while	i	was	here	,	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	a	lot	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
i	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	that	 ce 	 re 	 mon 	 y 	 	that	i	went	through	when	i	was	13	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	it	was	 call 	 ed 	 	female	genital	 mut 	 il 	 ation 	 	.
i	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	it	was	against	the	law	in	kenya	.
i	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	i	did	not	have	to	trade	part	of	my	body	to	get	an	education	.	i	had	a	right	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	we	speak	right	now	,	three	million	 girl 	 s 	 	in	africa	are	at	risk	of	going	through	 th 	 is 	 	 mut 	 il 	 ation 	 	.
i	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	my	mom	had	a	right	to	own	 proper 	 ty 	 	.
i	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	she	did	not	have	to	be	 abuse 	 d 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	she	is	a	woman	.
 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	made	me	 ang 	 ry 	 	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	went	back	,	every	time	i	went	,	i	found	that	my	 neighbor 	 s 	 	'	 girl 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	married	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 mutilate 	 d 	 	,	and	here	,	after	i	 graduate 	 d 	 	from	here	,	i	 work 	 ed 	 	at	the	u.n.	,	i	went	back	to	school	to	get	my	graduate	work	,	the	constant	cry	of	these	 girl 	 s 	 	was	in	my	face	.
i	had	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	went	back	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	the	men	,	to	the	village	,	and	 mother 	 s 	 	,	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	want	to	give	back	the	way	i	had	 promise 	 d 	 	you	that	i	would	come	back	and	help	you	.	what	do	you	need	?	``
 a 	 s 	 	i	spoke	to	the	women	,	they	told	me	,	``	you	know	what	we	need	?	we	 re 	 ally 	 	need	a	school	for	 girl 	 s 	 	.	``
 be 	 cause 	 	there	had	not	 be 	 en 	 	any	school	for	 girl 	 s 	 	.
and	the	reason	they	 want 	 ed 	 	the	school	for	 girl 	 s 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	when	a	girl	is	 rap 	 ed 	 	when	she	's	 walk 	 ing 	 	to	school	,	the	mother	is	 blame 	 d 	 	for	that	.	if	she	got	 pregn 	 ant 	 	before	she	got	married	,	the	mother	is	 blame 	 d 	 	for	that	,	and	she	's	 punish 	 ed 	 	.
she	's	 beat 	 en 	 	.
they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	put	our	 girl 	 s 	 	in	a	safe	place	.	``
 a 	 s 	 	we	 move 	 d 	 	,	and	i	went	to	talk	to	the	 father 	 s 	 	,	the	 father 	 s 	 	,	of	course	,	you	can	imagine	what	they	 s 	 aid 	 	:	``	we	want	a	school	for	 boy 	 s 	 	.	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	there	are	a	couple	of	men	from	my	village	who	have	 be 	 en 	 	out	and	they	have	gotten	an	education	.
why	ca	n't	they	build	a	school	for	 boy 	 s 	 	,	and	i	'll	build	a	school	for	 girl 	 s 	 	?	``
that	made	sense	.	and	they	 agree 	 d 	 	.
and	i	told	them	,	i	 want 	 ed 	 	them	to	show	me	a	sign	of	 commit 	 ment 	 	.
and	they	did	.	they	 don 	 ated 	 	land	where	we	built	the	 girl 	 s 	 	'	school	.	we	have	.
i	want	you	to	meet	one	of	the	 girl 	 s 	 	in	that	school	.
angeline	came	to	 app 	 ly 	 	for	the	school	,	and	she	did	not	meet	any	 cri 	 ter 	 ia 	 	that	we	had	.
she	's	an	orphan	.	 y 	 es 	 	,	we	could	have	taken	her	for	that	.
but	she	was	 old 	 er 	 	.	she	was	12	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	and	we	 we 	 re 	 	taking	 girl 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	in	fourth	grade	.
angeline	had	 be 	 en 	 	moving	from	one	place	--	 be 	 cause 	 	she	's	an	orphan	,	she	 ha 	 s 	 	no	mother	,	she	 ha 	 s 	 	no	father	--	moving	from	one	 grand 	 mother 	 	's	house	to	 an 	 other 	 	one	,	from	 aunt 	 ies 	 	to	 aunt 	 ies 	 	.	she	had	no	 st 	 ability 	 	in	her	life	.
and	i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	her	,	i	remember	that	day	,	and	i	saw	 some 	 thing 	 	beyond	what	i	was	 see 	 ing 	 	in	angeline	.
and	 y 	 es 	 	,	she	was	 old 	 er 	 	to	be	in	fourth	grade	.
we	 g 	 ave 	 	her	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	come	to	the	class	.
five	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	that	is	angeline	.
a	 transform 	 ation 	 	had	 beg 	 un 	 	in	her	life	.
angeline	 want 	 s 	 	to	be	a	pilot	so	she	can	fly	around	the	world	and	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
she	was	not	the	top	student	when	we	took	her	.
now	she	's	the	best	student	,	not	just	in	our	school	,	but	in	the	entire	division	that	we	are	in	.
that	's	sharon	.	that	's	five	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
that	's	evelyn	.	five	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	that	is	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	that	we	are	making	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	new	dawn	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	my	school	,	a	new	 begin 	 ning 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	we	speak	right	now	,	125	 girl 	 s 	 	will	never	be	 mutilate 	 d 	 	.
one	hundred	twenty	-	five	 girl 	 s 	 	will	not	be	married	when	they	're	12	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
one	hundred	twenty	-	five	 girl 	 s 	 	are	creating	and	 achiev 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 dream 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	thing	that	we	are	 do 	 ing 	 	,	giving	them	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	where	they	can	rise	.
 a 	 s 	 	we	speak	right	now	,	women	are	not	 be 	 ing 	 	 beat 	 en 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 revolution 	 s 	 	we	've	 start 	 ed 	 	in	our	community	.
i	want	to	 challeng 	 e 	 	you	 to 	 day 	 	.
