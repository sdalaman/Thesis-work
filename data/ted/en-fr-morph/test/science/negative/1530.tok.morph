good	afternoon	.
i	am	not	a	 farm 	 er 	 	.
i	'm	not	.	i	'm	a	parent	,	i	'm	a	resident	and	i	'm	a	teacher	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	world	.
and	 a 	 long 	 	the	way	i	've	 start 	 ed 	 	 not 	 ic 	 ing 	 	--	i	'm	on	my	third	generation	of	 kid 	 s 	 	--	that	they	're	 get 	 ting 	 	 big 	 ger 	 	.
they	're	 get 	 ting 	 	 sick 	 er 	 	.
in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	these	 complex 	 ities 	 	,	i	just	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	70	percent	of	the	 kid 	 s 	 	that	i	see	who	are	 label 	 ed 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	 dis 	 able 	 d 	 	would	not	have	 be 	 en 	 	had	they	had	proper	 pre 	 natal 	 	nutrition	.
the	 real 	 ities 	 	of	my	community	are	simple	.	they	look	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 kid 	 s 	 	should	not	have	to	grow	up	and	look	at	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	 job 	 s 	 	 continu 	 e 	 	to	 leav 	 e 	 	my	community	,	and	energy	 continu 	 es 	 	to	come	in	,	be	 export 	 ed 	 	in	,	it	's	no	wonder	that	 re 	 ally 	 	some	people	refer	to	the	south	bronx	 a 	 s 	 	a	desert	.
but	i	'm	the	 old 	 est 	 	sixth	 grad 	 er 	 	you	'll	ever	meet	,	so	i	get	up	every	day	with	 th 	 is 	 	tremendous	amount	of	 ent 	 husiasm 	 	that	i	'm	 hop 	 ing 	 	to	share	with	you	all	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	with	that	note	,	i	come	to	you	with	 th 	 is 	 	belief	that	 kid 	 s 	 	should	not	have	to	 leav 	 e 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	to	live	,	learn	and	earn	in	a	better	one	.
so	i	'm	here	to	tell	you	a	story	about	me	and	 th 	 is 	 	wall	that	i	met	 out 	 side 	 	,	which	i	'm	now	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	 in 	 side 	 	.
and	it	 start 	 s 	 	with	three	people	.
the	crazy	teacher	--	that	's	me	on	the	left	,	i	dress	up	 pre 	 tty 	 	,	thank	you	,	my	wife	,	i	love	you	for	 get 	 ting 	 	a	good	suit	--	my	passionate	borough	 p 	 resident 	 	and	a	guy	named	george	irwin	from	green	living	 techno 	 logies 	 	who	 help 	 ed 	 	me	with	my	class	and	 help 	 ed 	 	me	get	 involve 	 d 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	 patent 	 ed 	 	technology	.
but	it	all	 start 	 s 	 	with	 seed 	 s 	 	in	 class 	 rooms 	 	,	in	my	place	,	which	 look 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	i	'm	here	 to 	 day 	 	 hop 	 ing 	 	that	my	reach	will	exceed	my	grasp	.
and	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	what	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	about	.
and	it	 start 	 s 	 	with	 in 	 credible 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	who	come	early	and	stay	late	.
all	of	my	 kid 	 s 	 	are	either	iep	or	ell	 learn 	 ers 	 	,	most	come	with	a	lot	of	handicaps	,	most	are	 home 	 less 	 	and	 man 	 y 	 	are	in	foster	care	.
 al 	 most 	 	all	of	my	 kid 	 s 	 	live	 be 	 low 	 	poverty	.
but	with	 t 	 hose 	 	 seed 	 s 	 	,	from	day	one	,	we	are	growing	in	my	 class 	 room 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	in	my	 class 	 room 	 	.
and	you	see	how	attentive	these	 kid 	 s 	 	are	to	these	 seed 	 s 	 	.
and	then	you	notice	that	 t 	 hose 	 	 seed 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 farm 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	bronx	that	look	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	 aga 	 in 	 	,	i	am	not	a	 farm 	 er 	 	.	i	'm	a	teacher	.
and	i	do	n't	like	weeding	,	and	i	do	n't	like	back	-	 break 	 ing 	 	labor	.
so	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	figure	out	how	i	could	get	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	success	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	small	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	 br 	 ing 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	my	 class 	 room 	 	so	that	 handicap 	 ped 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	could	do	it	,	 kid 	 s 	 	who	did	n't	want	to	be	 out 	 side 	 	could	do	it	,	and	 every 	 one 	 	could	have	access	.
so	i	 call 	 ed 	 	george	irwin	,	and	what	do	you	know	?
he	came	to	my	class	and	we	built	an	 in 	 door 	 	 ed 	 ible 	 	wall	.
and	what	we	do	is	we	partner	it	with	authentic	 learn 	 ing 	 	 experience 	 s 	 	,	private	-	based	 learn 	 ing 	 	.
and	lo	and	 be 	 hold 	 	,	we	 g 	 ave 	 	birth	to	the	first	 ed 	 ible 	 	wall	in	new	york	city	.
so	if	you	're	 hung 	 ry 	 	,	get	up	and	eat	.
you	can	do	it	right	now	.	my	 kid 	 s 	 	play	cow	all	the	time	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?	but	we	 we 	 re 	 	just	 get 	 ting 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	,	the	 kid 	 s 	 	 love 	 d 	 	the	technology	,	so	we	 call 	 ed 	 	up	george	and	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	got	ta	learn	more	!	``
now	,	mayor	bloomberg	,	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	,	we	no	 long 	 er 	 	need	work	 permit 	 s 	 	,	which	 come 	 s 	 	with	 slice 	 s 	 	and	 bond 	 ed 	 	 contract 	 ors 	 	--	we	're	 avail 	 able 	 	for	you	--	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	go	to	boston	.
and	my	 kid 	 s 	 	,	from	the	 poor 	 est 	 	 congress 	 ional 	 	 di 	 strict 	 	in	america	,	 be 	 came 	 	the	first	to	install	a	green	wall	,	designed	by	a	computer	,	with	real	-	live	 learn 	 ing 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	,	21	 st 	 ories 	 	up	--	if	you	're	going	to	go	visit	it	,	it	's	on	top	of	the	john	hancock	building	.
but	 close 	 r 	 	to	home	,	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 install 	 ing 	 	these	 wall 	 s 	 	in	 school 	 s 	 	that	look	like	 th 	 is 	 	with	 light 	 ing 	 	like	that	,	real	led	stuff	,	21st	-	century	technology	.
and	what	do	you	know	?	we	made	21st	century	money	,	and	that	was	 ground 	 break 	 ing 	 	.	 w 	 ow 	 	!
 th 	 is 	 	is	my	harvest	,	people	.
and	what	do	you	do	with	 th 	 is 	 	food	?	you	cook	it	!
and	 t 	 hose 	 	are	my	 heir 	 loom 	 	 student 	 s 	 	making	 heir 	 loom 	 	sauce	,	with	plastic	 for 	 k 	 s 	 	,	and	we	get	it	 in 	 to 	 	the	cafeteria	,	and	we	grow	stuff	and	we	feed	our	 teacher 	 s 	 	.
and	that	is	the	 young 	 est 	 	 national 	 ly 	 	 cert 	 ified 	 	 work 	 force 	 	in	america	with	our	bronx	borough	 p 	 resident 	 	.
and	what	'd	we	do	then	?	well	,	i	met	nice	people	like	you	,	and	they	 invit 	 ed 	 	us	to	the	hamptons	.
so	i	call	 th 	 is 	 	``	from	south	bronx	to	southampton	.	``
and	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 put 	 ting 	 	in	 roof 	 s 	 	that	look	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	we	came	in	from	destitute	 neighbor 	 hood 	 s 	 	to	start	building	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	 w 	 ow 	 	!	people	 notice 	 d 	 	.
and	so	we	got	 invit 	 ed 	 	back	 th 	 is 	 	past	summer	,	and	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 move 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	hamptons	,	payed	3,500	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	week	for	a	house	,	and	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	how	to	surf	.
and	when	you	can	do	stuff	like	 th 	 is 	 	--	these	are	my	 kid 	 s 	 	 put 	 ting 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	technology	,	and	when	you	can	build	a	roof	that	 look 	 s 	 	like	that	on	a	house	that	 look 	 s 	 	like	that	with	sedum	that	 look 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	new	green	graffiti	.
so	,	you	may	wonder	what	 do 	 es 	 	a	wall	like	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	do	for	 kid 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 side 	 s 	 	changing	 land 	 scapes 	 	and	 mind 	 set 	 s 	 	?
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	what	it	 do 	 es 	 	.
it	 get 	 s 	 	me	to	meet	 in 	 credible 	 	 contract 	 ors 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	jim	ellenberger	from	ellenberger	 service 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	true	triple	bottom	line	.
 be 	 cause 	 	jim	 real 	 ized 	 	that	these	 kid 	 s 	 	,	my	future	 farm 	 ers 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	had	the	 skill 	 s 	 	he	 need 	 ed 	 	to	build	 afford 	 able 	 	housing	for	new	yorkers	,	right	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	my	 kid 	 s 	 	are	 do 	 ing 	 	,	making	living	wage	.
now	,	if	you	're	like	me	,	you	live	in	a	building	,	there	are	seven	 guy 	 s 	 	out	of	work	looking	to	manage	a	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
i	do	n't	have	it	.	but	if	you	need	a	toilet	 fix 	 ed 	 	or	,	you	know	,	some	 shelv 	 ing 	 	,	i	got	ta	wait	six	 month 	 s 	 	for	an	appointment	with	 some 	 one 	 	who	 drive 	 s 	 	a	much	 nic 	 er 	 	car	than	me	.
that	's	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
but	my	 kid 	 s 	 	are	now	 licens 	 ed 	 	and	 bond 	 ed 	 	in	trade	.
and	that	's	my	first	student	to	open	up	,	the	first	in	his	family	to	have	a	bank	account	.
 th 	 is 	 	 im 	 migrant 	 	student	is	the	first	one	in	his	family	to	use	an	atm	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	true	triple	bottom	line	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	can	take	 neighbor 	 hood 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 abandon 	 ed 	 	and	destitute	and	turn	them	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	with	 in 	 terior 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 w 	 ow 	 	!	people	 notice 	 d 	 	.	and	notice	they	did	.
so	cnn	 call 	 ed 	 	,	and	we	 we 	 re 	 	 de 	 light 	 ed 	 	to	have	them	come	to	our	 farm 	 er 	 	's	market	.
and	then	when	rockefeller	center	 s 	 aid 	 	,	nbc	,	could	you	put	 th 	 is 	 	thing	up	on	the	 wall 	 s 	 	?	we	 we 	 re 	 	 de 	 light 	 ed 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	show	you	,	when	 kid 	 s 	 	from	the	 poor 	 est 	 	 congress 	 ional 	 	 di 	 strict 	 	in	america	can	build	a	30	-	foot	by	15	-	foot	wall	,	design	it	,	plant	it	and	install	it	in	the	heart	of	new	york	city	,	that	's	a	true	``	sí	 s 	 e 	 	puede	``	moment	.
 re 	 ally 	 	scholastic	,	if	you	ask	me	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	getty	image	.
that	's	a	picture	i	took	of	my	bronx	borough	 p 	 resident 	 	,	 address 	 ing 	 	my	 kid 	 s 	 	in	his	house	,	not	the	jailhouse	,	making	them	feel	a	part	of	it	.
that	's	our	state	senator	gustavo	rivera	and	bob	bieder	,	coming	to	my	 class 	 room 	 	to	make	my	 kid 	 s 	 	feel	 import 	 ant 	 	.
and	when	the	bronx	borough	 p 	 resident 	 	 show 	 s 	 	up	and	the	state	senator	 come 	 s 	 	to	our	class	,	 believ 	 e 	 	you	me	,	the	bronx	can	change	 attitude 	 s 	 	now	.
we	are	 poise 	 d 	 	,	ready	,	 will 	 ing 	 	and	able	to	export	our	talent	and	 divers 	 ity 	 	in	ways	we	've	never	even	 imagin 	 ed 	 	.
and	when	the	local	senator	 get 	 s 	 	on	the	scale	in	public	and	 say 	 s 	 	he	's	got	to	lose	weight	,	so	do	i	!
and	i	tell	you	what	,	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	it	and	so	are	the	 kid 	 s 	 	.
