what	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	,	right	now	,	at	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	moment	,	is	 kill 	 ing 	 	you	.
more	than	 car 	 s 	 	or	the	 inter 	 net 	 	or	even	that	little	mobile	 de 	 vice 	 	we	keep	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	,	the	technology	you	're	using	the	most	 al 	 most 	 	every	day	is	 th 	 is 	 	,	your	tush	.
 now 	 a 	 day 	 s 	 	people	are	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	9.3	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	,	which	is	more	than	we	're	 sleep 	 ing 	 	,	at	7.7	 hour 	 s 	 	.
 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	is	so	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 pre 	 valent 	 	,	we	do	n't	even	question	how	much	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	,	and	 be 	 cause 	 	 every 	 one 	 	else	is	 do 	 ing 	 	it	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	even	occur	to	us	that	it	's	not	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
in	that	way	,	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	the	 smok 	 ing 	 	of	our	generation	.
of	course	there	's	health	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	,	 scar 	 y 	 	 one 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 side 	 s 	 	the	waist	.
 thing 	 s 	 	like	breast	cancer	and	colon	cancer	are	 direct 	 ly 	 	 ti 	 ed 	 	to	our	lack	of	physical	[	activity	]	,
ten	percent	in	fact	,	on	both	of	 t 	 hose 	 	.
six	percent	for	heart	disease	,	seven	percent	for	type	2	diabetes	,	which	is	what	my	father	 di 	 ed 	 	of	.
now	,	any	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 stat 	 s 	 	should	 con 	 vince 	 	each	of	us	to	get	off	our	duff	more	,	but	if	you	're	 any 	 thing 	 	like	me	,	it	wo	n't	.
what	did	get	me	moving	was	a	social	 interact 	 ion 	 	.
 some 	 one 	 	 invit 	 ed 	 	me	to	a	 meet 	 ing 	 	,	but	could	n't	manage	to	fit	me	in	to	a	regular	sort	of	 con 	 ference 	 	room	 meet 	 ing 	 	,	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	have	to	walk	my	 dog 	 s 	 	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	.	could	you	come	then	?	``	it	 seem 	 ed 	 	kind	of	odd	to	do	,	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	that	first	 meet 	 ing 	 	,	i	remember	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	i	have	to	be	the	one	to	ask	the	next	question	,	``	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 k 	 new 	 	i	was	going	to	huff	and	puff	 dur 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	conversation	.
and	yet	,	i	've	taken	that	idea	and	made	it	my	own	.
so	 in 	 stead 	 	of	going	to	coffee	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	or	fluorescent	-	lit	 con 	 ference 	 	room	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	i	ask	people	to	go	on	a	 walk 	 ing 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 	,	to	the	tune	of	20	to	30	 mile 	 s 	 	a	week	.
it	's	 change 	 d 	 	my	life	.
but	before	that	,	what	 actual 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	was	,	i	used	to	think	about	it	 a 	 s 	 	,	you	could	take	care	of	your	health	,	or	you	could	take	care	of	 oblig 	 ations 	 	,	and	one	 al 	 ways 	 	came	at	the	cost	of	the	other	.
so	now	,	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	hundred	of	these	 walk 	 ing 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	i	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	a	few	 thing 	 s 	 	.
first	,	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	thing	about	 actual 	 ly 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	out	of	the	box	that	 lead 	 s 	 	to	out	-	of	-	the	-	box	 think 	 ing 	 	.
 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	nature	or	the	 exercis 	 e 	 	 it 	 self 	 	,	it	 certain 	 ly 	 	 work 	 s 	 	.
and	second	,	and	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	more	 reflect 	 ive 	 	one	,	is	just	about	how	much	each	of	us	can	hold	 problem 	 s 	 	in	 op 	 position 	 	when	they	're	 re 	 ally 	 	not	that	way	.
and	if	we	're	going	to	solve	 problem 	 s 	 	and	look	at	the	world	 re 	 ally 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	in	 govern 	 ance 	 	or	business	or	 environment 	 al 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	,	job	creation	,	 may 	 be 	 	we	can	think	about	how	to	 re 	 frame 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	both	 thing 	 s 	 	be	true	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	when	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	walk	-	and	-	talk	idea	that	 thing 	 s 	 	 be 	 came 	 	 do 	 able 	 	and	 sustain 	 able 	 	and	 vi 	 able 	 	.
so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	talk	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	tush	,	so	i	'll	end	with	the	bottom	line	,	which	is	,	walk	and	talk	.
walk	the	talk	.
you	'll	be	 surprise 	 d 	 	at	how	fresh	air	 drive 	 s 	 	fresh	 think 	 ing 	 	,	and	in	the	way	that	you	do	,	you	'll	 br 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	your	life	an	 entire 	 ly 	 	new	set	of	 idea 	 s 	 	.
thank	you	.
