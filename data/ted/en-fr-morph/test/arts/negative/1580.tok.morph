over	the	past	six	 month 	 s 	 	,	i	've	 s 	 pent 	 	my	time
 travel 	 ing 	 	.	i	think	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	60,000	 mile 	 s 	 	,	but	 with 	 out 	 	 leav 	 ing 	 	my	desk	.
and	the	reason	i	can	do	that	is	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	 actual 	 ly 	 	two	people	.
i	look	like	one	person	but	i	'm	two	people	.	i	'm	eddie	who	is	here	,	and	at	the	same	time	,	my	alter	ego	is	a	big	green	 box 	 y 	 	avatar	 nick 	 named 	 	cyber	frank	.
so	that	's	what	i	 s 	 pend 	 	my	time	 do 	 ing 	 	.	i	'd	like	to	start	,	if	it	's	possible	,	with	a	test	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	do	business	stuff	,	so	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	that	we	focus	on	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	.
and	then	i	 struggle 	 d 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	``	what	should	i	talk	?	what	should	i	do	?	it	's	a	ted	audience	.
it	's	got	to	be	 stretch 	 ing 	 	.	how	am	i	going	to	make	--	?	``	so	i	just	hope	i	've	got	the	level	of	 difficult 	 y 	 	right	.
so	let	's	just	walk	our	way	through	 th 	 is 	 	.
 pleas 	 e 	 	could	you	work	 th 	 is 	 	through	with	me	?	you	can	shout	out	the	answer	if	you	like	.
the	question	is	,	which	of	these	 horizon 	 tal 	 	lines	is	 long 	 er 	 	?
the	answer	is	?
audience	:	the	same	.	eddie	obeng	:	the	same	.	no	,	they	're	not	the	same	.
they	're	not	the	same	.	the	top	one	is	10	percent	 long 	 er 	 	than	the	bottom	one	.
so	why	did	you	tell	me	they	 we 	 re 	 	the	same	?	do	you	remember	when	we	 we 	 re 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	at	school	,	about	that	big	,	they	 play 	 ed 	 	the	same	trick	on	us	?
it	was	to	teach	us	parallax	.	do	you	remember	?
and	you	got	,	you	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	it	's	the	same	!	``	and	you	got	it	wrong	.
you	remember	?	and	you	 learn 	 ed 	 	the	answer	,	and	you	've	carried	 th 	 is 	 	answer	in	your	head	for	10	,	20	,	30	,	40	 year 	 s 	 	:
the	answer	is	the	same	.	the	answer	is	the	same	.	so	when	you	're	 ask 	 ed 	 	what	the	 length 	 s 	 	are	,	you	say	they	're	the	same	,	but	they	're	not	the	same	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	've	 change 	 d 	 	it	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	explain	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	us	in	the	21st	century	.
 some 	 body 	 	or	 some 	 thing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	the	 rule 	 s 	 	about	how	our	world	 work 	 s 	 	.
when	i	'm	 jok 	 ing 	 	,	i	try	and	explain	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	at	 mid 	 night 	 	,	you	see	,	while	we	 we 	 re 	 	 a 	 sleep 	 	,	but	it	was	 mid 	 night 	 	15	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
you	did	n't	notice	it	?	but	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	what	they	do	is	,	they	 s 	 witch 	 ed 	 	all	the	 rule 	 s 	 	round	,	so	that	the	way	to	 success 	 fully 	 	run	a	business	,	an	 organ 	 ization 	 	,	or	even	a	country	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 delet 	 ed 	 	,	 flip 	 ped 	 	,	and	it	's	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	new	--	you	think	i	'm	 jok 	 ing 	 	,	do	n't	you	--	there	's	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	new	set	of	 rule 	 s 	 	in	operation	.
did	you	notice	that	?	i	mean	,	you	 mis 	 s 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
you	 prob 	 ably 	 	--	no	,	you	did	n't	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
my	simple	idea	is	that	what	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	is	,	the	real	21st	century	around	us	is	n't	so	obvious	to	us	,	so	 in 	 stead 	 	we	 s 	 pend 	 	our	time	 respond 	 ing 	 	 ration 	 ally 	 	to	a	world	which	we	understand	and	 recogn 	 ize 	 	,	but	which	no	 long 	 er 	 	 exist 	 s 	 	.
you	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	me	,	do	you	?	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
so	let	me	take	you	on	a	little	journey	of	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	i	do	n't	understand	.
if	you	search	amazon	for	the	word	``	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	,	``	you	'll	discover	 some 	 thing 	 	like	90,000	 book 	 s 	 	.
if	you	go	on	google	and	you	look	for	``	 innov 	 ation 	 	+	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	,	``	you	get	30	million	 hit 	 s 	 	.	if	you	add	the	word	``	 consult 	 ants 	 	,	``	it	 double 	 s 	 	to	60	million	.
are	you	with	me	?	and	yet	,	 statistic 	 ally 	 	,	what	you	discover	is	that	about	one	in	100,000	 idea 	 s 	 	is	found	making	money	or	 deliver 	 ing 	 	 benefit 	 s 	 	two	 year 	 s 	 	after	 it 	 s 	 	 in 	 ception 	 	.
it	 make 	 s 	 	no	sense	.	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	make	 the 	 ir 	 	expensive	 ex 	 ecutive 	 s 	 	 s 	 pend 	 	 age 	 s 	 	 care 	 fully 	 	 pre 	 par 	 ing 	 	 fore 	 cast 	 s 	 	and	 budget 	 s 	 	which	are	 obsolet 	 e 	 	or	need	changing	before	they	can	be	 publish 	 ed 	 	.
how	is	that	possible	?	if	you	look	at	the	 vision 	 s 	 	we	have	,	the	 vision 	 s 	 	of	how	we	're	going	to	change	the	world	,	the	key	thing	is	 implement 	 ation 	 	.	we	have	the	vision	.
we	've	got	to	make	it	happen	.
we	've	 s 	 pent 	 	 decade 	 s 	 	professionalizing	 implement 	 ation 	 	.
people	are	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	good	at	making	stuff	happen	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	if	i	use	 a 	 s 	 	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	a	family	of	five	going	on	 holi 	 day 	 	,	if	you	can	imagine	 th 	 is 	 	,	all	the	way	from	london	all	the	way	 a 	 cross 	 	to	hong	kong	,	what	i	want	you	to	think	about	is	 the 	 ir 	 	budget	is	 on 	 ly 	 	3,000	 pound 	 s 	 	of	 expense 	 s 	 	.
what	 actual 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	is	,	if	i	 compar 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	to	the	average	real	project	,	average	real	 success 	 ful 	 	project	,	the	family	 actual 	 ly 	 	end	up	in	makassar	,	south	sulawesi	,	at	a	cost	of	4,000	 pound 	 s 	 	,	whilst	 leav 	 ing 	 	two	of	the	children	 be 	 hind 	 	.
what	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	explain	to	you	is	,	there	are	 thing 	 s 	 	which	do	n't	make	sense	to	us	.
it	 get 	 s 	 	even	 wo 	 rse 	 	than	that	.	let	me	just	walk	you	through	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	quote	,	and	i	'll	just	pick	 word 	 s 	 	out	of	it	.
it	 say 	 s 	 	--	i	'll	put	on	the	voice	--	``	in	 summ 	 ary 	 	,	your	 majes 	 ty 	 	,	the	failure	to	foresee	the	 tim 	 ing 	 	,	 ex 	 tent 	 	and	 s 	 ever 	 ity 	 	of	the	crisis	was	due	to	the	lack	of	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	and	the	number	of	bright	 mind 	 s 	 	,	``	or	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	group	of	eminent	 economist 	 s 	 	 apolog 	 izing 	 	to	the	 que 	 en 	 	of	england	when	she	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	question	,	``	why	did	no	one	tell	us	that	the	crisis	was	coming	?	``	i	'll	never	get	my	 k 	 night 	 hood 	 	.	i	'll	never	get	my	 k 	 night 	 hood 	 	.
that	's	not	the	 import 	 ant 	 	point	.	the	thing	you	have	to	remember	is	,	these	are	eminent	 economist 	 s 	 	,	some	of	the	 smart 	 est 	 	people	on	the	planet	.	do	you	see	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	?
it	's	 scar 	 y 	 	.	my	friend	and	mentor	,	tim	 brow 	 n 	 	of	ideo	,	he	 explain 	 s 	 	that	design	must	get	big	,	and	he	's	right	.
he	 wise 	 ly 	 	 explain 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	to	us	.	he	 say 	 s 	 	design	 think 	 ing 	 	must	tackle	big	 system 	 s 	 	for	the	 challeng 	 es 	 	we	have	.
he	's	 absolute 	 ly 	 	right	.
and	then	i	ask	 my 	 self 	 	,	``	why	was	it	ever	small	?	``	is	n't	it	weird	?	you	know	,	if	 collabor 	 ation 	 	is	so	cool	,	is	cross	-	functional	 work 	 ing 	 	is	so	 amaz 	 ing 	 	,	why	did	we	build	these	huge	 hierarch 	 ies 	 	?	what	's	going	on	?
you	see	,	i	think	what	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	is	that	we	've	not	 notice 	 d 	 	that	change	i	 de 	 scribed 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	.
what	we	do	know	is	that	the	world	 ha 	 s 	 	 accele 	 rated 	 	.
 cyber 	 space 	 	 move 	 s 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	at	the	speed	of	light	.
technology	 accele 	 rates 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 exponential 	 ly 	 	.
so	if	 th 	 is 	 	is	now	,	and	that	's	the	past	,	and	we	start	 think 	 ing 	 	about	change	,	you	know	,	all	 government 	 s 	 	are	seeking	change	,	you	're	here	seeking	change	,	 every 	 body 	 	's	after	change	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	.
so	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	,	we	get	 th 	 is 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	whooshing	 accele 	 ration 	 	and	change	.
the	speed	is	 accele 	 rating 	 	.	that	's	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	.
at	the	same	time	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	that	,	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	weird	.
we	've	 double 	 d 	 	the	population	in	40	 year 	 s 	 	,	put	half	of	them	in	cities	,	then	 connect 	 ed 	 	them	all	up	so	they	can	interact	.
the	density	of	the	 interact 	 ion 	 	of	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	is	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
there	are	 chart 	 s 	 	which	show	all	these	 move 	 ments 	 	of	information	.	that	density	of	information	is	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
and	then	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	a	third	thing	.
you	know	,	for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	have	 a 	 s 	 	an	 off 	 ice 	 	a	little	desk	 under 	 neath 	 	the	 stair 	 s 	 	,	and	you	say	,	well	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	little	desk	under	the	 stair 	 s 	 	,	no	!	you	are	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	at	the	 head 	 quarter 	 s 	 	of	a	global	corporation	if	you	're	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
what	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	is	,	we	've	 change 	 d 	 	the	scale	.
 s 	 ize 	 	and	scale	are	no	 long 	 er 	 	the	same	.
and	then	add	to	that	,	every	time	you	tweet	,	over	a	third	of	your	 follow 	 ers 	 	follow	from	a	country	which	is	not	your	own	.
global	is	the	new	scale	.	we	know	that	.
and	so	people	say	 thing 	 s 	 	like	,	``	the	world	is	now	a	 turbul 	 ent 	 	place	.	``	have	you	heard	them	 say 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	?
and	they	use	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	metaphor	.	have	you	come	 a 	 cross 	 	 th 	 is 	 	?
and	they	think	it	's	a	metaphor	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	metaphor	.
it	's	 re 	 ality 	 	.	 a 	 s 	 	a	young	 engineer 	 ing 	 	student	,	i	remember	going	to	a	 demonst 	 ration 	 	where	they	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	the	 demonst 	 rator 	 	did	 some 	 thing 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 intrigu 	 ing 	 	.
what	he	did	was	,	he	got	a	 trans 	 parent 	 	pipe	--	have	you	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 demonst 	 ration 	 	before	?	--	he	 attach 	 ed 	 	it	to	a	tap	.	so	 effective 	 ly 	 	what	you	had	was	,	you	had	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	where	--	i	'll	try	and	draw	the	tap	and	the	pipe	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	i	'll	skip	the	tap	.	the	 tap 	 s 	 	are	hard	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?	so	i	'll	write	the	word	``	tap	.	``	is	that	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?	it	's	a	tap	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	he	 attach 	 es 	 	it	to	a	 trans 	 parent 	 	pipe	,	and	he	 turn 	 s 	 	the	water	on	.
and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	do	you	notice	 any 	 thing 	 	?	and	the	water	is	whooshing	down	 th 	 is 	 	pipe	.
i	mean	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 excit 	 ing 	 	stuff	.	are	you	with	me	?
so	the	water	 go 	 es 	 	up	.	he	 turn 	 s 	 	it	back	down	.	great	.
and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 any 	 thing 	 	you	notice	?	``	no	.	then	he	 stick 	 s 	 	a	needle	 in 	 to 	 	the	pipe	,	and	he	 connect 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	to	a	 contain 	 er 	 	,	and	he	 fill 	 s 	 	the	 contain 	 er 	 	up	with	green	ink	.	you	with	me	?
so	guess	what	 happen 	 s 	 	?	a	thin	green	line	 come 	 s 	 	out	 a 	 s 	 	it	 flow 	 s 	 	down	the	pipe	.	it	's	not	that	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
and	then	he	 turn 	 s 	 	the	water	up	a	bit	,	so	it	 start 	 s 	 	coming	back	in	.	and	 noth 	 ing 	 	 change 	 s 	 	.
so	he	's	changing	the	flow	of	the	water	,	but	it	's	just	a	 bor 	 ing 	 	green	line	.
he	 add 	 s 	 	some	more	.	he	 add 	 s 	 	some	more	.	and	then	 some 	 thing 	 	weird	 happen 	 s 	 	.
there	's	 th 	 is 	 	little	flicker	,	and	then	 a 	 s 	 	he	 turn 	 s 	 	it	ever	so	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	more	,	the	whole	of	that	green	line	 disappear 	 s 	 	,	and	 in 	 stead 	 	there	are	these	little	sort	of	inky	dust	 devil 	 s 	 	close	to	the	needle	.
they	're	 call 	 ed 	 	 ed 	 dies 	 	.	not	me	.	and	they	're	 violent 	 ly 	 	 dispers 	 ing 	 	the	ink	so	that	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 get 	 s 	 	 di 	 lute 	 d 	 	out	,	and	the	color	's	gone	.
what	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	world	of	pipe	is	 some 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 flip 	 ped 	 	it	.	they	've	 change 	 d 	 	the	 rule 	 s 	 	from	 lam 	 in 	 ar 	 	to	 turbul 	 ent 	 	.
all	the	 rule 	 s 	 	are	gone	.	in	that	environment	,	 instant 	 ly 	 	,	all	the	 possibil 	 ities 	 	which	 turbul 	 ence 	 	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	are	 avail 	 able 	 	,	and	it	's	not	the	same	 a 	 s 	 	 lam 	 in 	 ar 	 	.
and	if	we	did	n't	have	that	green	ink	,	you	'd	never	notice	.
and	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	our	 challeng 	 e 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 some 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	--	and	it	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	you	 guy 	 s 	 	with	all	your	tech	and	stuff	--	the	speed	,	the	scale	and	the	density	of	 interact 	 ion 	 	.
now	how	do	we	cope	and	deal	with	that	?
well	,	we	could	just	call	it	 turbul 	 ence 	 	,	or	we	could	try	and	learn	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	learn	,	but	i	know	you	 guy 	 s 	 	grew	up	in	the	 day 	 s 	 	when	there	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	correct	 answer 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	answer	you	 g 	 ave 	 	me	to	the	 horizon 	 tal 	 	line	 puzzl 	 e 	 	,	and	you	 believ 	 e 	 	it	will	last	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
so	i	'll	put	a	little	line	up	here	which	 represent 	 s 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	,	and	that	's	how	we	used	to	do	it	.	we	could	see	 thing 	 s 	 	,	understand	them	,	take	the	time	to	put	them	 in 	 to 	 	practice	.
out	here	is	the	world	.	now	,	what	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	our	pace
of	 learn 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	world	 ha 	 s 	 	 accele 	 rated 	 	?	well	,	if	you	work	for	a	corporation	,	you	'll	discover	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	difficult	to	work	on	stuff	which	your	 bo 	 s 	 s 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 ap 	 prove 	 	of	,	is	n't	in	the	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	,	and	 any 	 way 	 	,	you	've	got	to	go	through	your	 month 	 ly 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
if	you	work	in	an	institution	,	one	day	you	will	get	them	to	make	that	decision	.
and	if	you	work	in	a	market	where	people	 believ 	 e 	 	in	 cycle 	 s 	 	,	it	's	even	 funni 	 er 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	have	to	wait	all	the	way	for	the	cycle	to	fail	before	you	go	,	``	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	wrong	.	``	you	with	me	?
so	it	's	 like 	 ly 	 	that	the	line	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 learn 	 ing 	 	,	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	flat	.
you	with	me	?	 th 	 is 	 	point	over	here	,	the	point	at	which	the	lines	cross	over	,	the	pace	of	change	overtakes	the	pace	of	 learn 	 ing 	 	,	and	for	me	,	that	is	what	i	was	 de 	 s 	 crib 	 ing 	 	when	i	was	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	about	 mid 	 night 	 	.
so	what	 do 	 es 	 	it	do	to	us	?	well	,	it	 complete 	 ly 	 	 transform 	 s 	 	what	we	have	to	do	,	 man 	 y 	 	 mistak 	 es 	 	we	make	.	we	solve	last	year	's	 problem 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	future	.	if	you	try	and	think	about	it	,	the	 thing 	 s 	 	you	're	solving	now	,	what	 problem 	 s 	 	are	they	going	to	 br 	 ing 	 	in	the	future	?
if	you	have	n't	 under 	 stood 	 	the	world	you	're	living	in	,	it	's	 al 	 most 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	to	be	 absolute 	 ly 	 	certain	that	what	you	're	going	to	deliver	 fit 	 s 	 	.
i	'll	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	a	quick	one	.	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	and	 idea 	 s 	 	,	i	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	that	 ear 	 lier 	 	.	all	the	ceos	around	me	,	my	 client 	 s 	 	,	they	want	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	so	they	seek	 innov 	 ation 	 	.	they	say	to	people	,	``	take	 risk 	 s 	 	and	be	creative	!	``	but	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	the	 word 	 s 	 	get	 transform 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	travel	through	the	air	.
 enter 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 ear 	 s 	 	,	what	they	hear	is	,	``	do	crazy	 thing 	 s 	 	and	then	i	'll	fire	you	.	``	why	?	 be 	 cause 	 	--
why	?	 be 	 cause 	 	in	the	old	world	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	in	the	old	world	,	over	here	,	 get 	 ting 	 	stuff	wrong	was	 un 	 accept 	 able 	 	.
if	you	got	 some 	 thing 	 	wrong	,	you	'd	 fail 	 ed 	 	.	how	should	you	be	 treat 	 ed 	 	?
well	,	harshly	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	could	have	 ask 	 ed 	 	 some 	 body 	 	who	had	experience	.

the	answer	is	,	do	n't	do	 thing 	 s 	 	which	are	different	.
and	then	 sudden 	 ly 	 	we	tell	them	to	and	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	.
you	see	,	in	 re 	 ality 	 	,	there	are	two	ways	you	can	fail	in	our	new	world	.
one	,	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	you	should	follow	a	procedure	to	,	and	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	thing	,	you	're	 slop 	 py 	 	,	you	get	it	wrong	.	how	should	you	be	 treat 	 ed 	 	?	you	should	 prob 	 ably 	 	be	 fire 	 d 	 	.
on	the	other	hand	,	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	new	,	no	one	's	ever	 d 	 one 	 	before	,	you	get	it	 complete 	 ly 	 	wrong	.	how	should	you	be	 treat 	 ed 	 	?
well	,	free	 pizza 	 s 	 	!	you	should	be	 treat 	 ed 	 	better	than	the	people	who	succeed	.
