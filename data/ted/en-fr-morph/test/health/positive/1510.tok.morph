so	let	me	start	by	taking	you	back	,	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	mists	of	your	 memor 	 y 	 	to	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	the	most	 anticip 	 ated 	 	year	in	your	life	,	but	 certain 	 ly 	 	the	most	 anticip 	 ated 	 	year	in	all	human	 histo 	 ry 	 	:	the	year	2000	.	remember	that	?
y	2k	,	the	 dot 	 com 	 	bubble	,	 stress 	 ing 	 	about	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	party	you	're	going	to	go	to	 a 	 s 	 	the	clock	 strike 	 s 	 	 mid 	 night 	 	,	before	the	 champ 	 agne 	 	 go 	 es 	 	flat	,	and	then	there	's	that	 inch 	 o 	 ate 	 	 year 	 ning 	 	that	was	felt	,	i	think	,	by	 man 	 y 	 	,	that	the	 mill 	 e 	 nnium 	 	,	that	the	year	2000	,	should	mean	more	,	more	than	just	a	two	and	some	 zero 	 es 	 	.
well	,	 amaz 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	for	once	,	our	world	 lead 	 ers 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	lived	up	to	that	 mill 	 e 	 nnium 	 	moment	and	back	in	2000	 agree 	 d 	 	to	some	 pre 	 tty 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	stuff	:	 vision 	 ary 	 	,	 measur 	 able 	 	,	long	-	term	 target 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 mill 	 e 	 nnium 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	 goal 	 s 	 	.	now	,	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	you	all	keep	a	copy	of	the	 goal 	 s 	 	under	your	 pil 	 low 	 	,	or	by	the	 bed 	 side 	 	table	,	but	just	in	case	you	do	n't	,	and	your	 memor 	 y 	 	 need 	 s 	 	some	 jog 	 ging 	 	,	the	deal	 agree 	 d 	 	then	 go 	 es 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	:	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	 promise 	 d 	 	to	at	 l 	 east 	 	 halv 	 e 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 	poverty	,	 hung 	 er 	 	and	 death 	 s 	 	from	disease	,	 a 	 long 	 side 	 	some	other	 target 	 s 	 	,	by	2015	,	and	 develop 	 ed 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	 promise 	 d 	 	to	help	them	get	that	 d 	 one 	 	by	dropping	 debt 	 s 	 	,	increasing	smart	aid	,	and	trade	reform	.
well	,	we	're	 approach 	 ing 	 	2015	,	so	we	'd	better	assess	,	how	are	we	 do 	 ing 	 	on	these	 goal 	 s 	 	?
but	we	've	 al 	 so 	 	got	to	decide	,	do	we	like	 s 	 uch 	 	global	 goal 	 s 	 	?
some	people	do	n't	.	and	if	we	like	them	,	we	've	got	to	decide	what	we	want	to	do	on	these	 goal 	 s 	 	going	forward	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	the	world	want	to	do	together	?
we	've	got	to	decide	a	process	by	which	we	decide	.
well	,	i	 definite 	 ly 	 	think	these	 goal 	 s 	 	are	worth	building	on	and	 see 	 ing 	 	through	,	and	here	's	just	a	few	 reason 	 s 	 	why	.
 in 	 credible 	 	 partner 	 ship 	 s 	 	between	the	private	sector	,	 politic 	 al 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	,	 philanthro 	 pist 	 s 	 	and	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 grass 	 root 	 s 	 	 activist 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	250,000	people	 march 	 ed 	 	in	the	 street 	 s 	 	of	edinburgh	 out 	 side 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	building	for	make	poverty	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
all	together	,	they	 achiev 	 ed 	 	these	 result 	 s 	 	:	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	the	number	of	people	on	anti	-	retrovirals	,	life	-	saving	anti	-	 aid 	 s 	 	 drug 	 s 	 	;	 near 	 ly 	 	 halv 	 ed 	 	 death 	 s 	 	from	malaria	;	 vaccin 	 ated 	 	so	 man 	 y 	 	that	5.4	million	 live 	 s 	 	will	be	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	.
and	 combine 	 d 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	result	in	two	million	 few 	 er 	 	children	 dy 	 ing 	 	every	year	,	last	year	,	than	in	the	year	2000	.
that	's	5,000	 few 	 er 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	 dy 	 ing 	 	every	day	,	ten	 time 	 s 	 	you	lot	not	dead	every	day	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	all	of	these	 partner 	 ship 	 s 	 	.
so	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	 amaz 	 ing 	 	living	proof	of	progress	that	more	people	should	know	about	,	but	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	of	 commun 	 ic 	 ating 	 	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	good	news	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	subject	of	a	different	tedtalk	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	for	now	,	 any 	 one 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 get 	 ting 	 	these	 result 	 s 	 	,	thank	you	.	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	 prov 	 ed 	 	these	 goal 	 s 	 	are	worth	it	.
but	there	's	still	a	lot	of	 un 	 finish 	 ed 	 	business	.
still	,	7.6	million	children	die	every	year	of	 prevent 	 able 	 	,	 treat 	 able 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	,	and	178	million	 kid 	 s 	 	are	 mal 	 nourish 	 ed 	 	to	the	point	of	 stunt 	 ing 	 	,	a	 horr 	 ible 	 	term	which	 mean 	 s 	 	physical	and	cognitive	 life 	 long 	 	 impair 	 ment 	 	.
so	there	's	 plain 	 ly 	 	a	lot	more	to	do	on	the	 goal 	 s 	 	we	've	got	.
but	then	,	a	lot	of	people	think	there	are	 thing 	 s 	 	that	should	have	 be 	 en 	 	in	the	original	package	that	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 agree 	 d 	 	back	then	that	should	now	be	 include 	 d 	 	,	like	 sustain 	 able 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	 target 	 s 	 	,	natural	resource	 govern 	 ance 	 	 target 	 s 	 	,	access	to	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	,	to	knowledge	,	 equ 	 ity 	 	,	 fight 	 ing 	 	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	.
all	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	 measur 	 able 	 	and	could	be	in	the	new	 goal 	 s 	 	.
but	the	key	thing	here	is	,	what	do	you	think	should	be	in	the	new	 goal 	 s 	 	?
what	do	you	want	?
are	you	 annoy 	 ed 	 	that	i	did	n't	talk	about	gender	 e 	 quality 	 	or	education	?
should	 t 	 hose 	 	be	in	the	new	package	of	 goal 	 s 	 	?
and	 quit 	 e 	 	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	that	's	a	good	question	,	but	there	's	going	to	be	some	tough	tradeoffs	and	 choice 	 s 	 	here	,	so	you	want	to	hope	that	the	process	by	which	the	world	 decide 	 s 	 	these	new	 goal 	 s 	 	is	going	to	be	legitimate	,	right	?
well	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	gather	here	in	edinburgh	,	technocrats	 ap 	 point 	 ed 	 	by	the	u.n.	and	certain	 government 	 s 	 	,	with	the	best	 intent 	 ions 	 	,	are	busying	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 design 	 ing 	 	a	new	package	of	 goal 	 s 	 	,	and	 current 	 ly 	 	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	that	through	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	the	same	old	late	-	20th	-	century	,	top	-	down	,	elite	,	closed	process	.
but	,	of	course	,	since	then	,	the	web	and	mobile	 tele 	 phony 	 	,	 a 	 long 	 	with	 ubiqu 	 it 	 ous 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	tv	 format 	 s 	 	have	spread	all	around	the	world	.
so	what	we	'd	like	to	 pro 	 pose 	 	is	that	we	use	them	to	involve	people	from	all	around	the	world	in	an	historic	first	:	the	world	's	first	 tru 	 ly 	 	global	poll	and	 consult 	 ation 	 	,	where	 every 	 one 	 	 every 	 where 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	an	equal	voice	for	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	time	.
i	mean	,	would	n't	it	be	a	huge	historic	 mis 	 s 	 ed 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	not	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	 give 	 n 	 	that	we	can	?
there	's	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 billion 	 s 	 	of	your	aid	 dollar 	 s 	 	at	 s 	 take 	 	,	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	 live 	 s 	 	,	or	 death 	 s 	 	,	at	 s 	 take 	 	,	and	,	i	'd	 argu 	 e 	 	,	the	security	and	future	of	you	and	your	family	is	 al 	 so 	 	at	 s 	 take 	 	.
so	,	if	you	're	with	me	,	i	'd	say	there	's	three	essential	 step 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 crowd 	 sourcing 	 	campaign	:	 collect 	 ing 	 	,	 connect 	 ing 	 	and	 commit 	 ting 	 	.
so	first	of	all	,	we	've	got	to	ground	 th 	 is 	 	campaign	in	core	 poll 	 ing 	 	data	.
let	's	go	 in 	 to 	 	every	country	that	will	let	us	in	,	ask	1,001	people	what	they	want	the	new	 goal 	 s 	 	to	be	,	making	special	 effort 	 s 	 	to	reach	the	 poor 	 est 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 with 	 out 	 	access	to	modern	technology	,	and	let	's	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	 the 	 ir 	 	 view 	 s 	 	are	at	the	center	of	the	 goal 	 s 	 	going	forward	.
then	,	we	've	got	to	commission	a	 base 	 line 	 	survey	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	we	can	monitor	and	progress	the	 goal 	 s 	 	going	forward	.	the	original	 goal 	 s 	 	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	have	good	 base 	 line 	 	survey	data	,	and	we	're	going	to	need	the	help	of	big	data	through	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	process	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	we	can	 re 	 ally 	 	monitor	the	progress	.
and	then	we	've	got	to	connect	with	the	big	crowd	.
now	here	,	we	see	the	role	for	an	unprecedented	 coal 	 ition 	 	of	social	media	 giant 	 s 	 	and	upstarts	,	 tele 	 com 	 s 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	,	 re 	 ality 	 	tv	show	 format 	 s 	 	,	 gam 	 ing 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	,	 tele 	 com 	 s 	 	,	all	of	them	together	in	kind	of	 the 	 ir 	 	``	we	are	the	world	``	moment	.
could	they	come	together	and	help	the	 mill 	 e 	 nnium 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	 goal 	 s 	 	get	 re 	 brand 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 millennia 	 l 	 	generation	's	 goal 	 s 	 	?
and	if	just	five	percent	of	the	five	billion	plus	who	are	 current 	 ly 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	made	a	comment	,	and	that	comment	 turn 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 commit 	 ment 	 	,	we	could	 crowd 	 source 	 	a	force	of	300	million	people	around	the	world	to	help	see	these	 goal 	 s 	 	through	.
if	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	 collect 	 ed 	 	data	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	crowd	,	based	 up 	 on 	 	our	experience	of	 campaign 	 ing 	 	and	 get 	 ting 	 	world	 lead 	 ers 	 	to	commit	,	i	think	world	 lead 	 ers 	 	will	commit	to	most	of	the	 crowd 	 sourced 	 	 recommend 	 ations 	 	.
but	the	question	 re 	 ally 	 	is	,	through	 th 	 is 	 	process	will	we	all	have	 be 	 come 	 	 commit 	 ted 	 	?
and	if	we	are	,	are	we	ready	to	iterate	,	monitor	and	provide	 feed 	 back 	 	,	make	 s 	 ure 	 	these	 promise 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 deliver 	 ing 	 	 result 	 s 	 	?
well	,	there	's	some	fantastic	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	here	to	scale	up	,	 most 	 ly 	 	 pilot 	 ed 	 	 with 	 in 	 	africa	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
there	's	open	data	kenya	,	which	geocodes	and	crowdsources	information	about	where	 project 	 s 	 	are	,	are	they	 deliver 	 ing 	 	 result 	 s 	 	.
often	,	they	're	not	in	the	right	place	.
and	ushahidi	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	``	witness	``	in	swahili	,	which	geocodes	and	crowdsources	information	in	complex	 emerge 	 ncies 	 	to	help	target	 respons 	 es 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	some	of	the	most	 excit 	 ing 	 	stuff	in	 develop 	 ment 	 	and	 demo 	 cracy 	 	,	where	 citizen 	 s 	 	on	the	edge	of	a	network	are	 help 	 ing 	 	to	force	open	the	process	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	the	big	global	aid	 promise 	 s 	 	and	vague	stuff	up	at	the	top	 re 	 ally 	 	 deliver 	 s 	 	for	people	at	a	 grass 	 root 	 s 	 	level	and	inverts	that	pyramid	.
 th 	 is 	 	 open 	 ness 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	forcing	 open 	 ness 	 	,	is	key	,	and	if	it	was	n't	 entire 	 ly 	 	 trans 	 parent 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	,	i	should	be	open	:	i	've	got	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	 trans 	 parent 	 	agenda	.
long	-	term	 trend 	 s 	 	suggest	that	 th 	 is 	 	century	is	going	to	be	a	tough	place	to	live	,	with	population	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	,	consumption	 pattern 	 s 	 	increasing	,	and	conflict	over	scarce	natural	 resource 	 s 	 	.
and	look	at	the	state	of	global	 politic 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
look	at	the	rio	earth	 summ 	 it 	 	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	just	last	week	,	or	the	mexican	g	20	,	 al 	 so 	 	last	week	.
both	,	if	we	're	honest	,	a	bust	.
our	world	 lead 	 ers 	 	,	our	global	 politic 	 s 	 	,	 current 	 ly 	 	ca	n't	get	it	 d 	 one 	 	.
they	need	our	help	.	they	need	the	cavalry	,	and	the	cavalry	's	not	going	to	come	from	mars	.
it	's	got	to	come	from	us	,	and	i	see	 th 	 is 	 	process	of	 dec 	 id 	 ing 	 	 democrat 	 ically 	 	in	a	bottom	-	up	fashion	what	the	world	 want 	 s 	 	to	work	on	together	 a 	 s 	 	one	vital	 mean 	 s 	 	by	which	we	can	 crowd 	 source 	 	the	force	to	 re 	 ally 	 	build	that	 constit 	 uency 	 	that	's	going	to	reinvigorate	global	 govern 	 ance 	 	in	the	21st	century	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	in	2000	.	let	me	finish	in	2030	.
 man 	 y 	 	people	made	 f 	 un 	 	of	a	big	campaign	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	we	had	 call 	 ed 	 	make	poverty	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
it	was	a	naive	thought	in	 man 	 y 	 	people	's	 mind 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	true	,	it	was	just	a	t	-	shirt	slogan	that	 work 	 ed 	 	for	the	moment	.	but	look	.
the	 empir 	 ical 	 	condition	of	living	under	a	dollar	and	25	is	 trend 	 ing 	 	down	,	and	look	where	it	 get 	 s 	 	to	by	2030	.
it	's	 get 	 ting 	 	near	zero	.
now	 s 	 ure 	 	,	progress	in	 chin 	 a 	 	and	india	and	poverty	 r 	 eduction 	 	there	was	key	to	that	,	but	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 al 	 so 	 	in	africa	,	poverty	rates	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 reduc 	 ed 	 	.
it	will	get	 hard 	 er 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	get	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	zero	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	poor	will	be	 increasing 	 ly 	 	 locate 	 d 	 	in	post	-	conflict	,	fragile	 state 	 s 	 	,	or	 may 	 be 	 	in	middle	income	 state 	 s 	 	where	they	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	care	about	the	 marginal 	 ized 	 	.
but	i	'm	confident	,	with	the	right	kind	of	 politic 	 al 	 	 campaign 	 ing 	 	and	creative	and	 techno 	 logical 	 	 innov 	 ation 	 	 combine 	 d 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	together	more	and	more	 a 	 s 	 	one	,	i	think	we	can	get	 th 	 is 	 	and	other	 goal 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	.
thank	you	.
chris	anderson	:	jamie	,	here	's	the	 puzzl 	 e 	 	to	me	.
if	there	was	an	incident	 to 	 day 	 	where	a	hundred	 kid 	 s 	 	 di 	 ed 	 	in	some	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	or	where	,	say	,	a	hundred	 kid 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 kidnap 	 ped 	 	and	then	 rescu 	 ed 	 	by	special	 force 	 s 	 	,	i	mean	,	it	would	be	all	over	the	news	for	a	week	,	right	?
you	just	put	up	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	one	of	your	 number 	 s 	 	there	,	that	5,000	--	is	that	the	number	?
jamie	drummond	:	 few 	 er 	 	children	every	day	.
ca	:	five	thousand	 few 	 er 	 	children	 dy 	 ing 	 	every	day	.
i	mean	,	it	 dwarf 	 s 	 	,	 dwarf 	 s 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	that	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	on	our	news	agenda	,	and	it	's	 in 	 visible 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	must	drive	you	crazy	.
jd	:	it	 do 	 es 	 	,	and	we	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	huge	debate	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	about	aid	 level 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	and	aid	 al 	 one 	 	is	not	the	whole	solution	.	 no 	 body 	 	 think 	 s 	 	it	is	.
but	,	you	know	,	if	people	saw	the	 result 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	smart	aid	,	i	mean	,	they	'd	be	going	crazy	for	it	.
i	wish	the	250,000	people	who	 re 	 ally 	 	did	march	 out 	 side 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	building	 k 	 new 	 	these	 result 	 s 	 	.
right	now	they	do	n't	,	and	it	would	be	great	to	find	a	way	to	better	communicate	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	not	.
 creative 	 ly 	 	,	we	've	 fail 	 ed 	 	to	communicate	 th 	 is 	 	success	so	far	.
if	 t 	 hose 	 	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 effort 	 s 	 	just	could	 multi 	 ply 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	voice	and	 ampl 	 ify 	 	it	at	the	key	 moment 	 s 	 	,	i	know	for	a	fact	we	'd	get	better	policy	.
the	mexican	g	20	need	not	have	 be 	 en 	 	a	bust	.
rio	,	if	 any 	 one 	 	 care 	 s 	 	about	the	environment	,	need	not	have	 be 	 en 	 	a	bust	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
but	these	 con 	 ference 	 s 	 	are	going	on	,	and	i	know	people	get	 skeptic 	 al 	 	and	 cynic 	 al 	 	about	the	big	global	summits	and	the	 promise 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	never	 be 	 ing 	 	 ke 	 pt 	 	,	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	the	bits	that	are	,	are	making	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	,	and	what	the	 politic 	 ians 	 	need	is	more	 per 	 mission 	 	from	the	public	.
ca	:	but	you	have	n't	fully	 work 	 ed 	 	out	the	web	 mechan 	 ism 	 s 	 	,	etc	.	by	which	 th 	 is 	 	might	happen	.
i	mean	,	if	the	people	here	who	've	had	experience	using	open	 platform 	 s 	 	,	you	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	to	talk	with	them	 th 	 is 	 	week	and	try	to	take	 th 	 is 	 	forward	.
jd	:	 absolute 	 ly 	 	.	ca	:	all	right	,	well	i	must	say	,	if	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	led	in	some	way	to	 advanc 	 ing 	 	that	idea	,	that	's	a	huge	idea	,	and	if	you	carry	that	forward	,	that	is	 re 	 ally 	 	awesome	,	so	thank	you	.	jd	:	i	'd	love	your	help	.
