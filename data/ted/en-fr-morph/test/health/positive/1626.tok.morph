i	'd	like	to	show	you	a	video	of	some	of	the	 model 	 s 	 	i	work	with	.
they	're	all	the	perfect	 s 	 ize 	 	,	and	they	do	n't	have	an	ounce	of	fat	.
did	i	 ment 	 ion 	 	they	're	 gorge 	 ous 	 	?
and	they	're	scientific	 model 	 s 	 	?
 a 	 s 	 	you	might	have	 guess 	 ed 	 	,	i	'm	a	tissue	engineer	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	video	of	some	of	the	 beat 	 ing 	 	heart	that	i	've	engineered	in	the	lab	.
and	one	day	we	hope	that	these	 tissue 	 s 	 	can	serve	 a 	 s 	 	 re 	 placement 	 	 part 	 s 	 	for	the	human	body	.
but	what	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	about	 to 	 day 	 	is	how	these	 tissue 	 s 	 	make	awesome	 model 	 s 	 	.
well	,	let	's	think	about	the	drug	 screen 	 ing 	 	process	for	a	moment	.
you	go	from	drug	 formula 	 tion 	 	,	lab	 test 	 ing 	 	,	animal	 test 	 ing 	 	,	and	then	 clinic 	 al 	 	 trial 	 s 	 	,	which	you	might	call	human	 test 	 ing 	 	,	before	the	 drug 	 s 	 	get	to	market	.
it	 cost 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	money	,	a	lot	of	time	,	and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	even	when	a	drug	 hit 	 s 	 	the	market	,	it	 act 	 s 	 	in	an	 un 	 predict 	 able 	 	way	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	 hurt 	 s 	 	people	.
and	the	 lat 	 er 	 	it	 fail 	 s 	 	,	the	 wo 	 rse 	 	the	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	.
it	all	 boil 	 s 	 	down	to	two	 issue 	 s 	 	.	one	,	 human 	 s 	 	are	not	 rat 	 s 	 	,	and	two	,	 de 	 spite 	 	our	 in 	 credible 	 	 similar 	 ities 	 	to	one	 an 	 other 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 tin 	 y 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	between	you	and	i	have	huge	 impact 	 s 	 	with	how	we	 metabol 	 ize 	 	 drug 	 s 	 	and	how	 t 	 hose 	 	 drug 	 s 	 	affect	us	.
so	what	if	we	had	better	 model 	 s 	 	in	the	lab	that	could	not	 on 	 ly 	 	mimic	us	better	than	 rat 	 s 	 	but	 al 	 so 	 	reflect	our	 divers 	 ity 	 	?
let	's	see	how	we	can	do	it	with	tissue	 engineer 	 ing 	 	.
one	of	the	key	 techno 	 logies 	 	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	is	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	induced	 pluri 	 potent 	 	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	in	japan	 pre 	 tty 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	induced	 pluri 	 potent 	 	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	.
they	're	a	lot	like	 embryo 	 nic 	 	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	 ex 	 cept 	 	 with 	 out 	 	the	 contr 	 over 	 s 	 y 	 	.
we	induce	 cell 	 s 	 	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	say	,	skin	 cell 	 s 	 	,	by	 add 	 ing 	 	a	few	 gene 	 s 	 	to	them	,	 cultur 	 ing 	 	them	,	and	then	 harvest 	 ing 	 	them	.
so	they	're	skin	 cell 	 s 	 	that	can	be	 trick 	 ed 	 	,	kind	of	like	cellular	amnesia	,	 in 	 to 	 	an	 embryo 	 nic 	 	state	.
so	 with 	 out 	 	the	 contr 	 over 	 s 	 y 	 	,	that	's	cool	thing	number	one	.
cool	thing	number	two	,	you	can	grow	any	type	of	tissue
out	of	them	:	brain	,	heart	,	liver	,	you	get	the	picture	,	but	out	of	your	 cell 	 s 	 	.
so	we	can	make	a	model	of	your	heart	,	your	brain	on	a	chip	.
generating	 tissue 	 s 	 	of	 predict 	 able 	 	density	and	behavior	is	the	second	piece	,	and	will	be	 re 	 ally 	 	key	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	these	 model 	 s 	 	to	be	 adopt 	 ed 	 	for	drug	 discover 	 y 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	schematic	of	a	 bio 	 reactor 	 	we	're	 develop 	 ing 	 	in	our	lab	to	help	engineer	 tissue 	 s 	 	in	a	more	modular	,	 scal 	 able 	 	way	.
going	forward	,	imagine	a	 massive 	 ly 	 	parallel	version	of	 th 	 is 	 	with	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 piece 	 s 	 	of	human	tissue	.
it	would	be	like	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	 clinic 	 al 	 	trial	on	a	chip	.
but	 an 	 other 	 	thing	about	these	induced	 pluri 	 potent 	 	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	is	that	if	we	take	some	skin	 cell 	 s 	 	,	let	's	say	,	from	people	with	a	genetic	disease	and	we	engineer	 tissue 	 s 	 	out	of	them	,	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	use	tissue	-	 engineer 	 ing 	 	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	to	generate	 model 	 s 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	in	the	lab	.
here	's	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	from	kevin	eggan	's	lab	at	harvard	.
he	generated	 neuro 	 ns 	 	from	these	induced	 pluri 	 potent 	 	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	from	 patient 	 s 	 	who	have	lou	gehrig	's	disease	,	and	he	 different 	 iated 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	 neuro 	 ns 	 	,	and	what	's	 amaz 	 ing 	 	is	that	these	 neuro 	 ns 	 	 al 	 so 	 	show	 symptom 	 s 	 	of	the	disease	.
so	with	disease	 model 	 s 	 	like	these	,	we	can	fight	back	 fast 	 er 	 	than	ever	before	and	understand	the	disease	better	than	ever	before	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	discover	 drug 	 s 	 	even	 fast 	 er 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	patient	-	specific	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	engineered	from	 some 	 one 	 	with	 ret 	 initi 	 s 	 	 pigment 	 osa 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 de 	 generation 	 	of	the	retina	.
it	's	a	disease	that	 run 	 s 	 	in	my	family	,	and	we	 re 	 ally 	 	hope	that	 cell 	 s 	 	like	these	will	help	us	find	a	cure	.
so	some	people	think	that	these	 model 	 s 	 	sound	well	and	good	,	but	ask	,	``	well	,	are	these	 re 	 ally 	 	 a 	 s 	 	good	 a 	 s 	 	the	rat	?	``
the	rat	is	an	entire	organism	,	after	all	,
with	 interact 	 ing 	 	 network 	 s 	 	of	 organ 	 s 	 	.
a	drug	for	the	heart	can	get	 metabol 	 ized 	 	in	the	liver	,	and	some	of	the	 by 	 product 	 s 	 	may	be	 store 	 d 	 	in	the	fat	.
do	n't	you	 mis 	 s 	 	all	that	with	these	tissue	-	engineered	 model 	 s 	 	?
well	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	trend	in	the	field	.
by	 comb 	 in 	 ing 	 	tissue	 engineer 	 ing 	 	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	with	 micro 	 fluid 	 ic 	 s 	 	,	the	field	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 evolv 	 ing 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	just	that	,	a	model	of	the	entire	 eco 	 system 	 	of	the	body	,	complete	with	 multi 	 ple 	 	organ	 system 	 s 	 	to	be	able	to	test	how	a	drug	you	might	take	for	your	blood	pressure	might	affect	your	liver	or	an	 anti 	 depress 	 ant 	 	might	affect	your	heart	.
these	 system 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	to	build	,	but	we	're	just	 start 	 ing 	 	to	be	able	to	get	there	,	and	so	,	watch	out	.
but	that	's	not	even	all	of	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	once	a	drug	is	approved	,	tissue	 engineer 	 ing 	 	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	help	us	develop	more	 personal 	 ized 	 	 treat 	 ments 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	that	you	might	care	about	 some 	 day 	 	,	and	i	hope	you	never	do	,
 be 	 cause 	 	imagine	if	you	ever	get	that	call	that	 give 	 s 	 	you	that	bad	news	that	you	might	have	cancer	.
would	n't	you	 ra 	 ther 	 	test	to	see	if	 t 	 hose 	 	cancer	 drug 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	from	karen	burg	's	lab	,	where	they	're	using	 ink 	 jet 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	to	print	breast	cancer	 cell 	 s 	 	and	 stud 	 y 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 progress 	 ions 	 	and	 treat 	 ments 	 	.
and	some	of	our	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	at	tufts	are	 mix 	 ing 	 	 model 	 s 	 	like	these	with	tissue	-	engineered	bone	to	see	how	cancer	might	spread	from	one	part	of	the	body	to	the	next	,	and	you	can	imagine	 t 	 hose 	 	 kind 	 s 	 	of	multi	-	tissue	 chip 	 s 	 	to	be	the	next	generation	of	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 stud 	 ies 	 	.
and	so	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	 model 	 s 	 	that	we	've	just	 discuss 	 ed 	 	,	you	can	see	,	going	forward	,	that	tissue	 engineer 	 ing 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 poise 	 d 	 	to	help	 revolution 	 ize 	 	drug	 screen 	 ing 	 	at	every	single	step	of	the	path	:	disease	 model 	 s 	 	making	for	better	drug	 formula 	 tions 	 	,	 massive 	 ly 	 	parallel	human	tissue	 model 	 s 	 	 help 	 ing 	 	to	 revolution 	 ize 	 	lab	 test 	 ing 	 	,	 reduc 	 e 	 	animal	 test 	 ing 	 	and	human	 test 	 ing 	 	in	 clinic 	 al 	 	 trial 	 s 	 	,	and	 individual 	 ized 	 	 ther 	 a 	 pies 	 	that	disrupt	what	we	even	consider	to	be	a	market	at	all	.
 essential 	 ly 	 	,	we	're	 dramat 	 ically 	 	 speed 	 ing 	 	up	that	 feed 	 back 	 	between	 develop 	 ing 	 	a	molecule	and	 learn 	 ing 	 	about	how	it	 act 	 s 	 	in	the	human	body	.
our	process	for	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	 essential 	 ly 	 	 transform 	 ing 	 	 bio 	 technology 	 	and	 pharmaco 	 logy 	 	 in 	 to 	 	an	information	technology	,	 help 	 ing 	 	us	discover	and	evaluate	 drug 	 s 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	,	more	 cheap 	 ly 	 	and	more	 effective 	 ly 	 	.
it	 give 	 s 	 	new	meaning	to	 model 	 s 	 	against	animal	 test 	 ing 	 	,	 do 	 es 	 	n't	it	?
thank	you	.
