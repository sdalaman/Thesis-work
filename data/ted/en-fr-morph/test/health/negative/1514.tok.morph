i	want	to	start	on	a	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 som 	 ber 	 	note	.
two	thousand	and	seven	,	five	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	my	wife	 get 	 s 	 	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	with	breast	cancer	,	stage	iib	.
now	,	looking	back	,	the	most	 har 	 row 	 ing 	 	part	of	that	experience	was	not	just	the	hospital	 visit 	 s 	 	--	these	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 pain 	 ful 	 	for	my	wife	,	 understand 	 ably 	 	so	.
it	was	not	even	the	 initi 	 al 	 	shock	of	 know 	 ing 	 	that	she	had	breast	cancer	,	just	39	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	 absolute 	 ly 	 	no	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	cancer	in	her	family	.
the	most	 horr 	 ifying 	 	and	 agon 	 izing 	 	part	of	the	whole	experience	was	we	 we 	 re 	 	making	 decision 	 s 	 	after	 decision 	 s 	 	after	 decision 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	thrust	 up 	 on 	 	us	.
should	it	be	a	 mast 	 ectomy 	 	?	should	it	be	a	 lump 	 ectomy 	 	?
should	it	be	a	more	 aggress 	 ive 	 	form	of	 treat 	 ment 	 	,	 give 	 n 	 	that	it	was	stage	iib	?
with	all	the	side	 effect 	 s 	 	?
or	should	it	be	a	less	 aggress 	 ive 	 	form	of	 treat 	 ment 	 	?
and	these	 we 	 re 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 press 	 ed 	 	 up 	 on 	 	us	by	the	 doctor 	 s 	 	.
now	,	you	could	ask	 th 	 is 	 	question	,	why	 we 	 re 	 	the	 doctor 	 s 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	?
now	,	a	 simpl 	 istic 	 	answer	would	be	,	the	 doctor 	 s 	 	are	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	want	to	protect	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 legal 	 ly 	 	.
i	think	that	is	too	 simpl 	 istic 	 	.
these	are	well	-	meaning	 doctor 	 s 	 	,	some	of	them	have	gone	on	to	 be 	 come 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 friend 	 s 	 	.
they	 prob 	 ably 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	 follow 	 ing 	 	the	 wis 	 dom 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	come	down	the	 age 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 ad 	 age 	 	that	when	you	're	making	 decision 	 s 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 decision 	 s 	 	of	 import 	 ance 	 	,	it	's	best	to	be	in	charge	,	it	's	best	to	be	in	control	,	it	's	best	to	be	in	the	driver	's	seat	.
and	we	 we 	 re 	 	 certain 	 ly 	 	in	the	driver	's	seat	,	making	all	these	 decision 	 s 	 	,	and	let	me	tell	you	,	if	some	of	you	had	 be 	 en 	 	there	,	it	was	a	most	 agon 	 izing 	 	and	 har 	 row 	 ing 	 	experience	.
which	got	me	 think 	 ing 	 	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	is	there	any	 valid 	 ity 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	whole	 ad 	 age 	 	that	when	you	're	making	 decision 	 s 	 	,	it	's	best	to	take	the	driver	's	seat	,	be	in	charge	,	be	in	control	?
or	are	there	 con 	 text 	 s 	 	where	we	're	far	better	off	taking	the	passenger	's	seat	and	have	 some 	 one 	 	else	drive	?
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	a	 trust 	 ed 	 	financial	advisor	,	could	be	a	 trust 	 ed 	 	doctor	,	etc	.
and	since	i	 stud 	 y 	 	human	decision	making	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	i	'm	going	to	run	some	 stud 	 ies 	 	to	find	some	 answer 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'm	going	to	share	one	of	these	 stud 	 ies 	 	with	you	 to 	 day 	 	.
so	,	imagine	that	all	of	you	are	 particip 	 ants 	 	in	the	 stud 	 y 	 	.
i	want	to	tell	you	that	what	you	're	going	to	do	in	the	 stud 	 y 	 	is	you	're	going	to	drink	a	cup	of	tea	.
if	you	're	 wonder 	 ing 	 	why	,	i	'll	tell	you	why	in	a	few	 second 	 s 	 	from	now	.
you	are	going	to	solve	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 puzzl 	 es 	 	,	and	i	'm	going	to	show	you	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	these	 puzzl 	 es 	 	 moment 	 arily 	 	.
and	the	more	 puzzl 	 es 	 	you	solve	,	the	 great 	 er 	 	the	 chance 	 s 	 	that	you	'll	win	some	 prize 	 s 	 	.
now	,	why	do	you	have	to	 consum 	 e 	 	the	tea	?
why	?	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 make 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	sense	.
in	order	to	solve	these	 puzzl 	 es 	 	 effective 	 ly 	 	,	if	you	think	about	it	,	your	mind	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	in	two	 state 	 s 	 	 simultaneous 	 ly 	 	.
right	?	it	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	alert	,	for	which	 c 	 affe 	 ine 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	good	.
 simultaneous 	 ly 	 	,	it	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	calm	.
not	 agit 	 ated 	 	,	calm	.	for	which	chamomile	is	 ver 	 y 	 	good	.
now	 come 	 s 	 	the	between	-	 subject 	 s 	 	design	,	the	ab	design	,	the	ab	 test 	 ing 	 	.
so	what	i	'm	going	to	do	is	 random 	 ly 	 	assign	you	to	one	of	two	 group 	 s 	 	.
so	imagine	that	there	is	an	 imagin 	 ary 	 	line	out	here	,	so	 every 	 one 	 	here	will	be	group	a	,	 every 	 one 	 	out	here	will	be	group	b	.
now	,	for	you	 folk 	 s 	 	,	what	i	'm	going	to	do	is	i	'm	going	to	show	you	these	two	teas	,	and	i	'm	 ask 	 ing 	 	you	,	i	'll	go	 a 	 head 	 	and	ask	you	,	to	 choos 	 e 	 	your	tea	.	so	you	can	 choos 	 e 	 	which	of	the	two	tea	you	want	.
you	can	decide	,	what	is	your	mental	state	:	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	i	'm	going	to	 choos 	 e 	 	the	caffeinated	tea	,	i	'm	going	to	 choos 	 e 	 	the	chamomile	tea	.
so	you	're	going	to	be	in	charge	,	you	're	going	to	be	in	control	,	you	're	going	to	be	in	the	driver	's	seat	.
you	 folk 	 s 	 	,	i	'm	going	to	show	you	these	two	teas	,	but	you	do	n't	have	a	choice	.
i	'm	going	to	give	you	one	of	these	two	teas	,	and	keep	in	mind	,	i	'm	going	to	pick	one	of	these	two	teas	at	random	for	you	.
and	you	know	that	.
so	if	you	think	about	it	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 extrem 	 e 	 	case	scenario	,	 be 	 cause 	 	in	the	real	world	,	 when 	 ever 	 	you	are	taking	passenger	's	seat	,	 ver 	 y 	 	often	the	driver	is	going	to	be	 some 	 one 	 	you	trust	,	an	expert	,	etc	.	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 extrem 	 e 	 	case	scenario	.
now	,	you	're	all	going	to	 consum 	 e 	 	the	tea	.
so	imagine	that	you	are	taking	the	tea	now	,	we	'll	wait	for	you	to	finish	the	tea	.
we	'll	give	 an 	 other 	 	five	 minute 	 s 	 	for	the	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 	to	have	 it 	 s 	 	 effect 	 s 	 	.
now	you	're	going	to	have	30	 minute 	 s 	 	to	solve	15	 puzzl 	 es 	 	.
here	's	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	the	 puzzl 	 e 	 	you	're	going	to	solve	.
 any 	 one 	 	in	the	audience	want	to	take	a	stab	?
baba	shiv	:	 who 	 a 	 	!
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	that	's	cool	.
 yea 	 h 	 	,	so	what	we	do	if	we	had	you	,	who	will	get	the	answer	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 particip 	 ant 	 	,	we	would	have	 calibrate 	 d 	 	the	 difficult 	 y 	 	level	of	the	 puzzl 	 es 	 	to	your	 expert 	 ise 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	want	these	 puzzl 	 es 	 	to	be	difficult	.
these	are	 trick 	 y 	 	 puzzl 	 es 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	your	first	instinct	is	to	say	``	tulip	,	``	and	then	you	have	to	unstick	 your 	 self 	 	.
right	?	so	these	have	 be 	 en 	 	 calibrate 	 d 	 	to	your	level	of	 expert 	 ise 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	want	 th 	 is 	 	to	be	difficult	,	and	i	'll	tell	you	why	 moment 	 arily 	 	.
now	,	here	's	 an 	 other 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
 any 	 one 	 	?	it	's	much	more	difficult	.
bs	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	 w 	 ow 	 	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
so	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 aga 	 in 	 	difficult	.
you	will	say	``	kambar	,	``	then	you	will	have	to	go	,	``	maker	,	``	and	all	that	,	and	then	you	can	unstick	 your 	 self 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	you	have	30	 minute 	 s 	 	now	to	solve	these	15	 puzzl 	 es 	 	.
now	,	the	question	we	're	 ask 	 ing 	 	here	is	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	 out 	 come 	 	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	number	of	 puzzl 	 es 	 	 solve 	 d 	 	,	will	you	in	the	driver	's	seat	end	up	solving	more	 puzzl 	 es 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	are	in	control	,	you	could	decide	which	tea	you	will	 choos 	 e 	 	,	or	would	you	be	better	off	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	number	of	 puzzl 	 es 	 	 solve 	 d 	 	?
and	systemically	what	we	will	show	,	 a 	 cross 	 	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 stud 	 ies 	 	,	is	that	you	,	the	 passenger 	 s 	 	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	the	tea	was	 pick 	 ed 	 	for	you	at	random	,	will	end	up	solving	more	 puzzl 	 es 	 	than	you	,	the	 driver 	 s 	 	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	 observ 	 e 	 	 an 	 other 	 	thing	,	and	that	is	,	you	 folk 	 s 	 	not	 on 	 ly 	 	are	solving	 few 	 er 	 	 puzzl 	 es 	 	,	you	're	 al 	 so 	 	 put 	 ting 	 	less	juice	 in 	 to 	 	the	task	.
less	effort	,	you	're	less	 persist 	 ent 	 	,	and	so	on	.
how	do	you	know	that	?
well	we	have	two	 object 	 ive 	 	 measure 	 s 	 	.
one	is	,	what	is	the	time	,	on	average	,	you	're	taking	in	 attempt 	 ing 	 	to	solve	these	 puzzl 	 es 	 	?
you	will	 s 	 pend 	 	less	time	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	you	.
second	,	you	have	30	 minute 	 s 	 	to	solve	these	,	are	you	taking	the	entire	30	 minute 	 s 	 	,	or	are	you	giving	up	before	the	30	 minute 	 s 	 	elapse	?
you	will	be	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	give	up	before	the	30	 minute 	 s 	 	elapse	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	you	.
so	,	you	're	 put 	 ting 	 	in	less	juice	,	and	 there 	 fore 	 	the	 out 	 come 	 	:	 few 	 er 	 	 puzzl 	 es 	 	 solve 	 d 	 	.
now	,	that	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	us	now	to	,	why	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	happen	?
and	under	what	 situ 	 ations 	 	,	when	would	we	see	 th 	 is 	 	pattern	of	 result 	 s 	 	where	the	passenger	is	going	to	show	better	,	more	 favor 	 able 	 	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	the	driver	?
it	all	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	with	when	you	face	what	i	call	the	inca	.
it	's	an	acronym	that	 stand 	 s 	 	for	the	nature	of	the	 feed 	 back 	 	you	're	 get 	 ting 	 	after	you	've	made	the	decision	.
so	,	if	you	think	about	it	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	 puzzl 	 e 	 	task	,	it	could	happen	in	 invest 	 ing 	 	in	the	stock	market	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 volatil 	 e 	 	out	there	,	it	could	be	the	medical	 situ 	 ation 	 	--	the	 feed 	 back 	 	here	is	 im 	 mediate 	 	.
you	know	the	 feed 	 back 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	you	're	solving	the	 puzzl 	 es 	 	or	not	.
right	?	second	,	it	is	negative	.
remember	,	the	deck	was	 stack 	 ed 	 	against	you	.
in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	 difficult 	 y 	 	level	of	these	 puzzl 	 es 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	can	happen	in	the	medical	domain	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	early	on	in	the	 treat 	 ment 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	are	negative	,	the	 feed 	 back 	 	,	before	 thing 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	positive	.
right	?	it	can	happen	in	the	stock	market	.
 volatil 	 e 	 	stock	market	,	 get 	 ting 	 	negative	 feed 	 back 	 	that	's	 al 	 so 	 	 im 	 mediate 	 	.
and	the	 feed 	 back 	 	in	all	these	 case 	 s 	 	is	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	.
it	's	not	 ambigu 	 ous 	 	;	you	know	if	you	've	 solve 	 d 	 	the	 puzzl 	 es 	 	or	not	.
now	,	the	 add 	 ed 	 	one	,	 a 	 part 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	 immedi 	 acy 	 	,	negative	,	 th 	 is 	 	concreteness	,	now	you	have	a	sense	of	 age 	 ncy 	 	.
you	 we 	 re 	 	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	your	decision	.
so	what	do	you	do	?
you	focus	on	the	 fore 	 gone 	 	option	.
you	say	,	you	know	what	?	i	should	have	 chose 	 n 	 	the	other	tea	.
that	 cast 	 s 	 	your	decision	in	doubt	,	 reduc 	 es 	 	the	confidence	you	have	in	the	decision	,	 reduc 	 es 	 	the	confidence	you	have	in	the	performance	,	the	performance	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	solving	the	 puzzl 	 es 	 	.
and	 there 	 fore 	 	less	juice	 in 	 to 	 	the	task	,	 few 	 er 	 	 puzzl 	 es 	 	 solve 	 d 	 	,	a	less	 favor 	 able 	 	 out 	 come 	 	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	you	 folk 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	can	happen	in	the	medical	domain	,	if	you	think	about	it	.
right	?	a	patient	in	the	driver	's	seat	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
less	juice	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	 keep 	 ing 	 	 her 	 self 	 	or	 him 	 self 	 	less	 physical 	 ly 	 	fit	,	 physical 	 ly 	 	active	to	 ha 	 sten 	 	the	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	process	,	which	is	what	is	often	 advoc 	 ated 	 	.	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	would	n't	do	that	.
and	 there 	 fore 	 	,	there	are	 time 	 s 	 	when	you	're	facing	the	inca	,	when	the	 feed 	 back 	 	is	going	to	be	 im 	 mediate 	 	,	negative	,	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	,	and	you	have	the	sense	of	 age 	 ncy 	 	,	where	you	're	far	better	off	taking	the	passenger	's	seat	and	have	 some 	 one 	 	else	drive	.
now	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	off	on	the	 som 	 ber 	 	note	.
i	want	to	finish	up	on	a	more	 up 	 beat 	 	note	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	now	 be 	 en 	 	five	 year 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	more	than	five	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	the	good	news	,	thank	god	,	is	that	the	cancer	is	still	in	 re 	 mission 	 	.
so	it	all	 end 	 s 	 	well	,	but	one	thing	i	did	n't	 ment 	 ion 	 	was	that	 ver 	 y 	 	early	on	 in 	 to 	 	her	 treat 	 ment 	 	,	my	wife	and	i	 decide 	 d 	 	that	we	will	take	the	passenger	's	seat	.
and	that	made	so	much	of	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	peace	of	mind	that	came	with	that	,	we	could	focus	on	her	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	.
we	let	the	 doctor 	 s 	 	make	all	the	 decision 	 s 	 	,	take	the	driver	's	seat	.
thank	you	.
