i	was	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	with	my	 girl 	 s 	 	,	and	joy	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	dang	,	i	wish	he	'd	get	off	my	back	.
my	 d 	 addy 	 	,	he	 call 	 s 	 	me	all	the	time	.	``	``	 luck 	 y 	 	for	you	he	 call 	 s 	 	at	all	,	``	 s 	 aid 	 	 ja 	 s 	 mine 	 	.	``	i	have	n't	heard	from	my	dad	in	 year 	 s 	 	.	``	at	 th 	 is 	 	moment	,	i	 k 	 new 	 	the	 girl 	 s 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	a	way	to	connect	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 father 	 s 	 	.
at	camp	 div 	 a 	 	,	my	non	-	profit	 organ 	 ization 	 	,	we	have	these	 type 	 s 	 	of	 conversation 	 s 	 	all	the	time	 a 	 s 	 	a	way	to	help	 girl 	 s 	 	of	african	 d 	 escent 	 	 prep 	 are 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 pass 	 age 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 woman 	 hood 	 	.
these	 girl 	 s 	 	just	 need 	 ed 	 	a	way	to	 invit 	 e 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 father 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 term 	 s 	 	.
so	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	 girl 	 s 	 	,	``	how	can	we	help	other	 girl 	 s 	 	develop	 health 	 y 	 	 relationship 	 s 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 father 	 s 	 	?	``	``	let	's	have	a	dance	,	``	one	girl	 shout 	 ed 	 	,	and	all	the	 girl 	 s 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	 back 	 ed 	 	her	up	.
they	 start 	 ed 	 	 dream 	 ing 	 	about	the	 decor 	 ations 	 	,	 invit 	 ations 	 	,	the	 dress 	 es 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	wear	,	and	what	 the 	 ir 	 	 father 	 s 	 	could	and	could	not	wear	.
it	was	off	and	running	before	i	could	even	blink	my	 eye 	 s 	 	,	but	even	if	i	could	have	 s 	 low 	 ed 	 	down	 t 	 hose 	 	 girl 	 s 	 	,	i	would	n't	have	,	 be 	 cause 	 	one	thing	that	i	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	over	a	decade	of	 work 	 ing 	 	with	 girl 	 s 	 	is	that	they	 al 	 ready 	 	know	what	they	need	.
the	 wis 	 dom 	 	 live 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	of	them	.
 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	they	have	 infra 	 structure 	 	,	mentorship	and	 resource 	 s 	 	,	they	can	build	what	they	need	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	,	but	to	 thriv 	 e 	 	.
so	we	had	a	dance	,	and	 girl 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 father 	 s 	 	came	in	multitudes	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 dress 	 ed 	 	to	the	nines	.
they	 act 	 ed 	 	sweet	.
they	 act 	 ed 	 	 s 	 il 	 ly 	 	.
they	 re 	 ally 	 	 enjoy 	 ed 	 	each	other	's	company	.
it	was	a	huge	success	.
and	the	 girl 	 s 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	to	make	it	an	annual	event	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	the	 season 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	,	and	it	was	time	to	plan	the	dance	 aga 	 in 	 	,	one	girl	named	brianna	spoke	up	,	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	my	dad	ca	n't	come	to	the	dance	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	whole	thing	is	making	me	 s 	 ad 	 	.	``	``	why	not	?	``	the	 girl 	 s 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	.
``	 be 	 cause 	 	he	's	in	jail	,	``	she	 brave 	 ly 	 	admitted	.
``	well	,	can	he	just	get	out	for	a	day	?	``	one	of	the	 girl 	 s 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	.
``	and	come	in	 s 	 hack 	 les 	 	?
that	's	 wo 	 rse 	 	than	not	 hav 	 ing 	 	him	here	at	all	.	``	at	 th 	 is 	 	moment	,	i	saw	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	for	the	 girl 	 s 	 	to	rise	to	the	occasion	and	to	 be 	 come 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	heroes	.
so	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	``	what	do	you	think	we	should	do	about	 th 	 is 	 	?
we	want	every	girl	to	experience	the	dance	,	right	?	``	so	the	 girl 	 s 	 	thought	for	a	moment	,	and	one	girl	 suggest 	 ed 	 	,	``	why	do	n't	we	just	take	the	dance	in	the	jail	?	``	most	of	the	 girl 	 s 	 	 doubt 	 ed 	 	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	that	,	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	are	you	crazy	?
who	is	going	to	allow	a	bunch	of	little	 girl 	 s 	 	,	 dress 	 ed 	 	up	--	``	``	--	to	come	 in 	 side 	 	a	jail	and	dance	with	 the 	 ir 	 	daddies	in	spongebob	 suit 	 s 	 	?	``	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	what	they	 call 	 ed 	 	them	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 girl 	 s 	 	,	well	,	well	,	you	never	know	 un 	 less 	 	you	ask	.	``	so	a	letter	was	written	to	the	richmond	city	sheriff	,	 sign 	 ed 	 	 collect 	 ively 	 	by	each	girl	,	and	i	would	have	to	say	,	he	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	special	sheriff	.
he	 contact 	 ed 	 	me	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 when 	 ever 	 	there	is	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	 in 	 side 	 	,	his	 door 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 ways 	 	open	.
 be 	 cause 	 	one	thing	he	did	know	,	that	when	 father 	 s 	 	are	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	children	,	it	is	less	 like 	 ly 	 	that	they	will	return	.
so	,	16	 in 	 mate 	 s 	 	and	18	 girl 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 invit 	 ed 	 	.
the	 girl 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 dress 	 ed 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	sunday	best	,	and	the	 father 	 s 	 	 trade 	 d 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	yellow	and	blue	jumpsuits	for	 shirt 	 s 	 	and	ties	.
they	 hugg 	 ed 	 	.
they	 share 	 d 	 	a	full	catered	meal	of	chicken	and	fish	.
they	 laugh 	 ed 	 	together	.
it	was	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
the	 father 	 s 	 	and	 daughter 	 s 	 	even	 experience 	 d 	 	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	have	a	physical	 connect 	 ion 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	a	lot	of	them	did	n't	even	have	for	a	while	.
 father 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	in	a	space	where	they	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	make	 the 	 ir 	 	 daughter 	 s 	 	play	,	and	pull	out	her	chair	and	extend	his	hand	for	a	dance	.
even	the	 guard 	 s 	 	 cri 	 ed 	 	.
but	after	the	dance	,	we	all	 real 	 ized 	 	that	dad	still	would	be	in	jail	.
so	we	 need 	 ed 	 	to	create	 some 	 thing 	 	that	they	could	take	with	them	.
so	we	 br 	 ought 	 	in	flip	 cam 	 s 	 	,	and	we	had	them	look	at	the	flip	 cam 	 s 	 	and	just	interview	each	other	--	 the 	 ir 	 	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 thought 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	going	to	be	used	 a 	 s 	 	a	touchstone	so	when	they	 start 	 ed 	 	to	 mis 	 s 	 	each	other	and	feel	 dis 	 connect 	 ed 	 	,	they	could	 re 	 connect 	 	through	 th 	 is 	 	image	.
i	'll	never	forget	that	one	girl	 look 	 ed 	 	in	her	father	's	 eye 	 s 	 	with	that	camera	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 d 	 addy 	 	,	when	you	look	at	me	,	what	do	you	see	?	``	 be 	 cause 	 	our	daddies	are	our	 mirror 	 s 	 	that	we	reflect	back	on	when	we	decide	about	what	type	of	man	we	deserve	,	and	how	they	see	us	for	the	rest	of	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
i	know	that	 ver 	 y 	 	well	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	one	of	the	 luck 	 y 	 	 girl 	 s 	 	.
i	have	had	my	father	in	my	life	 al 	 ways 	 	.
he	's	even	here	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	that	is	why	it	is	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	special	for	me	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	these	 girl 	 s 	 	are	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 father 	 s 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	who	are	 separat 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 barb 	 ed 	 	 wire 	 s 	 	and	metal	 door 	 s 	 	.
we	have	just	 create 	 d 	 	a	form	for	 girl 	 s 	 	who	have	heavy	 question 	 s 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	heart	to	be	in	a	position	to	ask	 the 	 ir 	 	 father 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 question 	 s 	 	and	 give 	 n 	 	the	 father 	 s 	 	the	 free 	 dom 	 	to	answer	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	know	that	the	 father 	 s 	 	are	even	 leav 	 ing 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	one	thought	:	what	type	of	woman	am	i	 pre 	 par 	 ing 	 	to	put	in	the	world	?
 be 	 cause 	 	a	father	is	 lock 	 ed 	 	in	 do 	 es 	 	not	mean	he	should	be	 lock 	 ed 	 	out	of	his	daughter	's	life	.
