i	've	 al 	 ways 	 	written	 prim 	 arily 	 	about	 architect 	 ure 	 	,	about	 building 	 s 	 	,	and	writing	about	 architect 	 ure 	 	is	based	on	certain	 assumption 	 s 	 	.
an	architect	 design 	 s 	 	a	building	,	and	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	place	,	or	 man 	 y 	 	 architect 	 s 	 	design	 man 	 y 	 	 building 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	city	,	and	 regard 	 less 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	mix	of	 force 	 s 	 	of	 politic 	 s 	 	and	culture	and	 economic 	 s 	 	that	 shape 	 s 	 	these	 place 	 s 	 	,	at	the	end	of	the	day	,	you	can	go
and	you	can	visit	them	.	you	can	walk	around	them	.
you	can	smell	them	.	you	can	get	a	feel	for	them	.
you	can	experience	 the 	 ir 	 	sense	of	place	.
but	what	was	 s 	 tri 	 king 	 	to	me	over	the	last	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 year 	 s 	 	was	that	less	and	less	was	i	going	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	world	,	and	more	and	more	,	i	was	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	front	of	my	computer	screen	.
and	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	since	about	2007	,	when	i	got	an	iphone	,	i	was	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	front	of	my	screen	all	day	,	but	i	was	 al 	 so 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	up	at	the	end	of	the	day	and	looking	at	 th 	 is 	 	little	screen	that	i	carried	in	my	pocket	.
and	what	was	surprising	to	me	was	how	 quick 	 ly 	 	my	relationship	to	the	physical	world	had	 change 	 d 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	short	period	of	time	,	you	know	,	 whet 	 her 	 	you	call	it	the	last	15	 year 	 s 	 	or	so	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 on 	 line 	 	,	or	the	last	,	you	know	,	four	or	five	 year 	 s 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 on 	 line 	 	all	the	time	,	our	relationship	to	our	 surround 	 ing 	 s 	 	had	 change 	 d 	 	in	that	our	attention	is	 constant 	 ly 	 	 divid 	 ed 	 	.	you	know	,
we	're	both	looking	 in 	 side 	 	the	 screen 	 s 	 	and	we	're	looking	out	in	the	world	around	us	.
and	what	was	even	more	 s 	 tri 	 king 	 	to	me	,	and	what	i	 re 	 ally 	 	got	hung	up	on	,	was	that	the	world	 in 	 side 	 	the	screen	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	have	no	physical	 re 	 ality 	 	of	 it 	 s 	 	own	.
if	you	went	and	 look 	 ed 	 	for	 image 	 s 	 	of	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	all	that	you	found	,	 th 	 is 	 	famous	image	by	opte	of	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	kind	of	 milk 	 y 	 	way	,	 th 	 is 	 	infinite	expanse	where	we	do	n't	seem	to	be	 any 	 where 	 	on	it	.
we	can	never	seem	to	grasp	it	in	 it 	 s 	 	 total 	 ity 	 	.
it	's	 al 	 ways 	 	 re 	 minded 	 	me	of	the	apollo	image	of	the	earth	,	the	blue	 mar 	 ble 	 	picture	,	and	it	's	 similar 	 ly 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	to	suggest	,	i	think	,	that	we	ca	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	understand	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	whole	.
we	're	 al 	 ways 	 	sort	of	small	in	the	face	of	 it 	 s 	 	expanse	.
so	if	there	was	 th 	 is 	 	world	and	 th 	 is 	 	screen	,	and	if	there	was	the	physical	world	around	me	,	i	could	n't	ever	get	them	together	in	the	same	place	.
and	then	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.	my	 inter 	 net 	 	broke	one	day	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 occasion 	 ally 	 	 do 	 es 	 	,	and	the	cable	guy	came	to	fix	it	,	and	he	 start 	 ed 	 	with	the	 dust 	 y 	 	 c 	 lump 	 	of	 cable 	 s 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	the	couch	,	and	he	 follow 	 ed 	 	it	to	the	front	of	my	building	and	 in 	 to 	 	the	 base 	 ment 	 	and	out	to	the	back	yard	,	and	there	was	 th 	 is 	 	big	jumble	of	 cable 	 s 	 	against	the	wall	.
and	then	he	saw	a	squirrel	running	 a 	 long 	 	the	wire	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	there	's	your	problem	.
a	squirrel	is	 chew 	 ing 	 	on	your	 inter 	 net 	 	.	``
and	 th 	 is 	 	 seem 	 ed 	 	 astound 	 ing 	 	.	the	 inter 	 net 	 	is
a	 transcend 	 ent 	 	idea	.	it	's	a	set	of	 proto 	 col 	 s 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	from	 shop 	 ping 	 	to	 d 	 ating 	 	to	 revolution 	 s 	 	.	it	was	unequivocally	not	 some 	 thing 	 	a	squirrel	could	chew	on	.
but	that	in	fact	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	be	the	case	.
a	squirrel	had	in	fact	 chew 	 ed 	 	on	my	 inter 	 net 	 	.
and	then	i	got	 th 	 is 	 	image	in	my	head	of	what	would	happen	if	you	 yank 	 ed 	 	the	wire	from	the	wall	and	if	you	 start 	 ed 	 	to	follow	it	.	where	would	it	go	?
was	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	place	that	you	could	visit	?
could	i	go	there	?	who	would	i	meet	?
you	know	,	was	there	 some 	 thing 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	out	there	?
and	the	answer	,	by	all	 account 	 s 	 	,	was	no	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	black	box	with	a	red	light	on	it	,	 a 	 s 	 	 represent 	 ed 	 	in	the	sitcom	``	the	it	crowd	.	``	 normal 	 ly 	 	it	 live 	 s 	 	on	the	top	of	big	ben	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	where	you	get	the	best	 re 	 ception 	 	,	but	they	had	 negoti 	 ated 	 	that	 the 	 ir 	 	 col 	 league 	 	could	borrow	it	for	the	afternoon	to	use	in	an	 off 	 ice 	 	 present 	 ation 	 	.
the	 elder 	 s 	 	of	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 will 	 ing 	 	to	part	with	it	for	a	short	while	,	and	she	 look 	 s 	 	at	it	and	she	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 inter 	 net 	 	?	the	whole	 inter 	 net 	 	?	is	it	heavy	?	``	they	say	,	``	of	course	not	,	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	weigh	 any 	 thing 	 	.	``	and	i	was	 embarrass 	 ed 	 	.	i	was	looking	for	 th 	 is 	 	thing	that	 on 	 ly 	 	 fool 	 s 	 	seem	to	look	for	.
the	 inter 	 net 	 	was	that	 a 	 morpho 	 us 	 	blob	,	or	it	was	a	 s 	 il 	 ly 	 	black	box	with	a	 blink 	 ing 	 	red	light	on	it	.
it	was	n't	a	real	world	out	there	.
but	,	in	fact	,	it	is	.	there	is	a	real	world	of	the	 inter 	 net 	 	out	there	,	and	that	's	what	i	 s 	 pent 	 	about	two	 year 	 s 	 	 visit 	 ing 	 	,	these	 place 	 s 	 	of	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.	i	was	in	large	data	 center 	 s 	 	that	use	 a 	 s 	 	much	power	 a 	 s 	 	the	cities	in	which	they	 s 	 it 	 	,	and	i	 visit 	 ed 	 	 place 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	60	hudson	street	in	new	york	,	which	is	one	of	the	 building 	 s 	 	in	the	world	,	one	of	a	 ver 	 y 	 	short	list	of	 building 	 s 	 	,	about	a	dozen	 building 	 s 	 	,	where	more	 network 	 s 	 	of	the	 inter 	 net 	 	connect	to	each	other	than	 any 	 where 	 	else	.
and	that	 connect 	 ion 	 	is	an	unequivocally	physical	process	.
it	's	about	the	 route 	 r 	 	of	one	network	,	a	facebook	or	a	google	or	a	b.t	.	or	a	comcast	or	a	time	warner	,	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	,	 connect 	 ing 	 	with	 usual 	 ly 	 	a	yellow	fiber	-	optic	cable	up	 in 	 to 	 	the	 ceil 	 ing 	 	and	down	 in 	 to 	 	the	 route 	 r 	 	of	 an 	 other 	 	network	,	and	that	's	unequivocally	physical	,	and	it	's	 surprising 	 ly 	 	 intima 	 te 	 	.
a	building	like	60	hudson	,	and	a	dozen	or	so	 other 	 s 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	10	 time 	 s 	 	more	 network 	 s 	 	 connect 	 ing 	 	 with 	 in 	 	it	than	the	next	tier	of	 building 	 s 	 	.
there	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	short	list	of	these	 place 	 s 	 	.
and	60	hudson	in	 part 	 icular 	 	is	 interest 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	home	to	about	a	half	a	dozen	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 network 	 s 	 	,	which	are	the	 network 	 s 	 	which	serve	the	 under 	 sea 	 	 cable 	 s 	 	that	travel	 under 	 neath 	 	the	ocean	that	connect	europe	and	america	and	connect	all	of	us	.
and	it	's	 t 	 hose 	 	 cable 	 s 	 	in	 part 	 icular 	 	that	i	want	to	focus	on	.
if	the	 inter 	 net 	 	is	a	global	 phenomen 	 on 	 	,	if	we	live	in	a	global	village	,	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	there	are	 cable 	 s 	 	 under 	 neath 	 	the	ocean	,	 cable 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	in	 th 	 is 	 	dimension	,	they	are	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	small	.
you	can	you	hold	them	in	your	hand	.	they	're	like	a	garden	hose	.
but	in	the	other	dimension	they	are	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	expansive	,	 a 	 s 	 	expansive	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	imagine	.
they	stretch	 a 	 cross 	 	the	ocean	.	they	're	three	or	five
or	eight	thousand	 mile 	 s 	 	in	length	,	and	if	the	material	science	and	the	 computation 	 al 	 	technology	is	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	,	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	physical	process	is	 shock 	 ing 	 ly 	 	simple	.	light	 go 	 es 	 	in	on	one	end	of	the	ocean	and	 come 	 s 	 	out	on	the	other	,	and	it	 usual 	 ly 	 	 come 	 s 	 	from	a	building	 call 	 ed 	 	a	 land 	 ing 	 	station	that	's	often	 tuck 	 ed 	 	away	inconspicuously	in	a	little	seaside	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	,	and	there	are	amplifiers	that	 s 	 it 	 	on	the	ocean	floor	that	look	kind	of	like	 blue 	 fin 	 	tuna	,	and	every	50	 mile 	 s 	 	they	 ampl 	 ify 	 	the	signal	,	and	since	the	rate	of	 trans 	 mission 	 	is	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	fast	,	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	unit	is	a	10	-	gigabit	-	per	-	second	 wave 	 length 	 	of	light	,	 may 	 be 	 	a	thousand	 time 	 s 	 	your	own	 connect 	 ion 	 	,	or	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 carry 	 ing 	 	10,000	video	 stream 	 s 	 	,	but	not	 on 	 ly 	 	that	,	but	you	'll	put	not	just	one	 wave 	 length 	 	of	light	through	one	of	the	 fiber 	 s 	 	,	but	you	'll	put	 may 	 be 	 	50	or	60	or	70	different	 wave 	 length 	 s 	 	or	 color 	 s 	 	of	light	through	a	single	fiber	,	and	then	you	'll	have	 may 	 be 	 	eight	 fiber 	 s 	 	in	a	cable	,	four	going	in	each	direction	.
and	they	're	 tin 	 y 	 	.	they	're	the	 thick 	 ness 	 	of	a	hair	.
and	then	they	connect	to	the	continent	 some 	 where 	 	.
they	connect	in	a	 man 	 hole 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.	 liter 	 ally 	 	,
 th 	 is 	 	is	where	the	5,000	-	mile	cable	 plug 	 s 	 	in	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	in	halifax	,	a	cable	that	 stretch 	 es 	 	from	halifax	to	ireland	.
and	the	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	is	changing	.	three	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,
when	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	there	was	one	cable	down	the	western	coast	of	africa	,	 represent 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	map	by	steve	song	 a 	 s 	 	that	thin	black	line	.
now	there	are	six	 cable 	 s 	 	and	more	coming	,	three	down	each	coast	.
 be 	 cause 	 	once	a	country	 get 	 s 	 	 plug 	 ged 	 	in	by	one	cable	,	they	 real 	 ize 	 	that	it	's	not	 en 	 ough 	 	.	if	they	're	going	to	build	an	industry	around	it	,	they	need	to	know	that	 the 	 ir 	 	 connect 	 ion 	 	is	n't	 ten 	 uous 	 	but	permanent	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	a	cable	 break 	 s 	 	,	you	have	to	 s 	 end 	 	a	ship	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	water	,	throw	a	 grappl 	 ing 	 	hook	over	the	side	,	pick	it	up	,	find	the	other	end	,	and	then	fuse	the	two	 end 	 s 	 	back	together	and	then	dump	it	over	.
it	's	an	 intens 	 e 	 ly 	 	,	 intens 	 e 	 ly 	 	physical	process	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	friend	simon	cooper	,	who	 un 	 til 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	for	tata	 communication 	 s 	 	,	the	 communication 	 s 	 	wing	of	tata	,	the	big	indian	industrial	conglomerate	.
and	i	've	never	met	him	.	we	've	 on 	 ly 	 	 communicate 	 d 	 	via	 th 	 is 	 	 tele 	 presence 	 	system	,	which	 al 	 ways 	 	 make 	 s 	 	me	think	of	him	 a 	 s 	 	the	man	 in 	 side 	 	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
and	he	is	english	.	the	 under 	 sea 	 	cable	industry	is	 dominate 	 d 	 	by	englishmen	,	and	they	all	seem	to	be	42	.
 be 	 cause 	 	they	all	 start 	 ed 	 	at	the	same	time	with	the	boom	about	20	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	tata	had	gotten	 it 	 s 	 	start	 a 	 s 	 	a	 communication 	 s 	 	business	when	they	 b 	 ought 	 	two	 cable 	 s 	 	,	one	 a 	 cross 	 	the	atlantic	and	one	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	,	and	 proceed 	 ed 	 	to	add	 piece 	 s 	 	onto	them	,	 un 	 til 	 	they	had	built	a	belt	around	the	world	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	they	will	 s 	 end 	 	your	bits	to	the	east	or	the	west	.
they	have	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	 liter 	 ally 	 	a	beam	of	light	around	the	world	,	and	if	a	cable	 break 	 s 	 	in	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	,	it	'll	 s 	 end 	 	it	around	the	other	direction	.	and	then	 hav 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	that	,
they	 start 	 ed 	 	to	look	for	 place 	 s 	 	to	wire	next	.
they	 look 	 ed 	 	for	the	unwired	 place 	 s 	 	,	and	that	's	 me 	 ant 	 	north	and	south	,	 prim 	 arily 	 	these	 cable 	 s 	 	to	africa	.
but	what	 amaze 	 s 	 	me	is	simon	's	 in 	 credible 	 	 geo 	 graphic 	 	 imagin 	 ation 	 	.
he	 think 	 s 	 	about	the	world	with	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	 expansive 	 ness 	 	.
and	i	was	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	see	one	of	these	 cable 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	built	.	see	,	you	know	,	all	the	time	 on 	 line 	 	we	experience	these	 fleet 	 ing 	 	 moment 	 s 	 	of	 connect 	 ion 	 	,	these	sort	of	brief	adjacencies	,	a	tweet	or	a	facebook	post	or	an	email	,	and	it	 seem 	 ed 	 	like	there	was	a	physical	 co 	 roll 	 ary 	 	to	that	.
it	 seem 	 ed 	 	like	there	was	a	moment	when	the	continent	was	 be 	 ing 	 	 plug 	 ged 	 	in	,	and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	see	that	.
and	simon	was	 work 	 ing 	 	on	a	new	cable	,	wacs	,	the	west	africa	cable	system	,	that	 stretch 	 ed 	 	from	lisbon	down	the	west	coast	of	africa	,	to	cote	d'ivoire	,	to	ghana	,	to	nigeria	,	to	cameroon	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	there	was	coming	soon	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	the	weather	,	but	he	'd	let	me	know	when	,	and	so	with	about	four	 day 	 s 	 	notice	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	to	go	to	 th 	 is 	 	beach	south	of	lisbon	,	and	a	little	after	9	,	 th 	 is 	 	guy	will	walk	out	of	the	water	.
and	he	'll	be	 carry 	 ing 	 	a	green	nylon	line	,	a	 light 	 weight 	 	line	,	 call 	 ed 	 	a	messenger	line	,	and	that	was	the	first	link	between	sea	and	land	,	 th 	 is 	 	link	that	would	then	be	 leverage 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	9,000	-	mile	path	of	light	.
then	a	 bulldoze 	 r 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	to	pull	the	cable	in	from	 th 	 is 	 	 special 	 ized 	 	cable	 land 	 ing 	 	ship	,	and	it	was	 float 	 ed 	 	on	these	 buoy 	 s 	 	 un 	 til 	 	it	was	in	the	right	place	.
then	you	can	see	the	english	 engineer 	 s 	 	looking	on	.
and	then	,	once	it	was	in	the	right	place	,	he	got	back	in	the	water	 hold 	 ing 	 	a	big	knife	,	and	he	cut	each	buoy	off	,	and	the	buoy	 pop 	 ped 	 	up	 in 	 to 	 	the	air	,	and	the	cable	 drop 	 ped 	 	to	the	sea	floor	,	and	he	did	that	all	the	way	out	to	the	ship	,	and	when	he	got	there	,	they	 g 	 ave 	 	him	a	glass	of	juice	and	a	cookie	,	and	then	he	 jump 	 ed 	 	back	in	,	and	he	swam	back	to	shore	,	and	then	he	lit	a	 cigar 	 ette 	 	.
and	then	once	that	cable	was	on	shore	,	they	 beg 	 an 	 	to	 prep 	 are 	 	to	connect	it	to	the	other	side	,	for	the	cable	that	had	 be 	 en 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	down	from	the	 land 	 ing 	 	station	.
and	first	they	got	it	with	a	hacksaw	,	and	then	they	start	sort	of	 s 	 hav 	 ing 	 	away	at	 th 	 is 	 	plastic	 in 	 terior 	 	with	a	--
sort	of	 work 	 ing 	 	like	 chef 	 s 	 	,	and	then	 final 	 ly 	 	they	're	 work 	 ing 	 	like	 jewel 	 ers 	 	to	get	these	hair	-	thin	 fiber 	 s 	 	to	line	up	with	the	cable	that	had	come	down	,	and	with	 th 	 is 	 	hole	-	punch	machine	they	fuse	it	together	.
and	when	you	see	these	 guy 	 s 	 	going	at	 th 	 is 	 	cable	with	a	hacksaw	,	you	stop	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	cloud	.
it	 start 	 s 	 	to	seem	like	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	physical	thing	.
and	what	 surprise 	 d 	 	me	 a 	 s 	 	well	was	that	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	based	on	the	most	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	technology	,	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	new	thing	,	the	physical	process	 it 	 self 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	around	for	a	long	time	,	and	the	culture	is	the	same	.
you	see	the	local	 labor 	 ers 	 	.	you	see	the	english	engineer	giving	 direction 	 s 	 	in	the	 back 	 ground 	 	.	and	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,
the	 place 	 s 	 	are	the	same	.	these	 cable 	 s 	 	still	connect	these	classic	port	cities	,	 place 	 s 	 	like	lisbon	,	mombasa	,	mumbai	,	singapore	,	new	york	.
and	then	the	process	on	shore	 take 	 s 	 	around	three	or	four	 day 	 s 	 	,	and	then	,	when	it	's	 d 	 one 	 	,	they	put	the	 man 	 hole 	 	cover	back	on	top	,	and	they	push	the	sand	over	that	,	and	we	all	forget	about	it	.
and	it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	that	we	talk	a	lot	about	the	cloud	,	but	every	time	we	put	 some 	 thing 	 	on	the	cloud	,	we	give	up	some	 respons 	 ibility 	 	for	it	.
we	are	less	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	it	.	we	let	other	people	worry	about	it	.
and	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	seem	right	.
there	's	a	great	neal	stephenson	line	where	he	 say 	 s 	 	that	wired	people	should	know	 some 	 thing 	 	about	 wire 	 s 	 	.
and	we	should	know	,	i	think	,	we	should	know	where	our	 inter 	 net 	 	 come 	 s 	 	from	,	and	we	should	know	what	it	is	that	 physical 	 ly 	 	,	 physical 	 ly 	 	 connect 	 s 	 	us	all	.
thank	you	.
