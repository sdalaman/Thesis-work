i	have	to	say	that	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	glad	to	be	here	.
i	understand	we	have	over	80	 count 	 ries 	 	here	,	so	that	's	a	whole	new	paradigm	for	me	to	speak	to	all	of	these	 count 	 ries 	 	.
in	each	country	,	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	you	have	 th 	 is 	 	thing	 call 	 ed 	 	the	parent	-	teacher	 con 	 ference 	 	.
do	you	know	about	the	parent	-	teacher	 con 	 ference 	 	?
not	the	 one 	 s 	 	for	your	 kid 	 s 	 	,	but	the	one	you	had	 a 	 s 	 	a	child	,	where	your	 parent 	 s 	 	come	to	school	and	your	teacher	 talk 	 s 	 	to	your	 parent 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	a	little	bit	awkward	.
well	,	i	remember	in	third	grade	,	i	had	 th 	 is 	 	moment	where	my	father	,	who	never	 take 	 s 	 	off	from	work	,	he	's	a	 classic 	 al 	 	blue	collar	,	a	 work 	 ing 	 	-	class	 im 	 migrant 	 	person	,	going	to	school	to	see	his	son	,	how	he	's	 do 	 ing 	 	,	and	the	teacher	 s 	 aid 	 	to	him	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	,	john	is	good	at	math	and	art	.	``
and	he	kind	of	 nod 	 d 	 ed 	 	,	you	know	?
the	next	day	i	saw	him	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	a	 custom 	 er 	 	at	our	 to 	 fu 	 	store	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	,	john	's	good	at	math	.	``
and	that	 al 	 ways 	 	 s 	 tuck 	 	with	me	all	my	life	.
why	did	n't	dad	say	art	?	why	was	n't	it	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
why	?	it	 be 	 came 	 	a	question	my	entire	life	,	and	that	's	all	right	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	good	at	math	 me 	 ant 	 	he	 b 	 ought 	 	me	a	computer	,	and	some	of	you	remember	 th 	 is 	 	computer	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	my	first	computer	.
who	had	an	apple	ii	?	apple	ii	 user 	 s 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	cool	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	remember	,	the	apple	ii	did	 noth 	 ing 	 	at	all	.
you	'd	plug	it	in	,	you	'd	type	in	it	and	green	text	would	come	out	.
it	would	say	you	're	wrong	most	of	the	time	.
that	was	the	computer	we	 k 	 new 	 	.
that	computer	is	a	computer	that	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	about	going	to	mit	,	my	father	's	dream	.	and	at	mit	,	 how 	 ever 	 	,	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	about	the	computer	at	all	 level 	 s 	 	,	and	after	,	i	went	to	art	school	to	get	away	from	 computer 	 s 	 	,	and	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	think	about	the	computer	 a 	 s 	 	more	of	a	spiritual	space	of	 think 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	was	 influence 	 d 	 	by	performance	art	--
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	20	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.	i	made	a	computer	out	of	people	.
it	was	 call 	 ed 	 	the	human	powered	computer	experiment	.
i	have	a	power	 manage 	 r 	 	,	mouse	driver	,	 memor 	 y 	 	,	etc	.	,	and	i	built	 th 	 is 	 	in	kyoto	,	the	old	capital	of	japan	.
it	's	a	room	broken	in	two	 halv 	 es 	 	.
i	've	 turn 	 ed 	 	the	computer	on	,	and	these	 assist 	 ants 	 	are	placing	a	giant	 flop 	 py 	 	 dis 	 k 	 	built	out	of	 card 	 board 	 	,	and	it	's	put	 in 	 to 	 	the	computer	.
and	the	 flop 	 py 	 	 dis 	 k 	 	drive	person	 wear 	 s 	 	it	.
she	 find 	 s 	 	the	first	sector	on	the	 dis 	 k 	 	,	and	 take 	 s 	 	data	off	the	 dis 	 k 	 	and	 pass 	 es 	 	it	off	to	,	of	course	,	the	bus	.
so	the	bus	 diligent 	 ly 	 	 car 	 ries 	 	the	data	 in 	 to 	 	the	computer	to	the	 memor 	 y 	 	,	to	the	cpu	,	the	vram	,	etc	.	,	and	it	's	an	actual	 work 	 ing 	 	computer	.	that	's	a	bus	,	 re 	 ally 	 	.
and	it	 look 	 s 	 	kind	of	fast	.	that	's	a	mouse	driver	,	where	it	's	xy	.
it	 look 	 s 	 	like	it	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	kind	of	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	but	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 low 	 	computer	,	and	when	i	 real 	 ized 	 	how	 s 	 low 	 	 th 	 is 	 	computer	was	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	how	fast	a	computer	is	,	it	made	me	wonder	about	 computer 	 s 	 	and	technology	in	general	.
and	so	i	'm	going	to	talk	 to 	 day 	 	about	four	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	.
the	first	three	 thing 	 s 	 	are	about	how	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 cur 	 ious 	 	about	technology	,	design	and	art	,	and	how	they	intersect	,	how	they	 over 	 lap 	 	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	a	 top 	 ic 	 	that	i	've	taken	on	since	four	 year 	 s 	 	ago	i	 be 	 came 	 	the	 p 	 resident 	 	and	i	'll	talk	about	how	i	've	 look 	 ed 	 	to	combine	these	four	 area 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	kind	of	a	synthesis	,	a	kind	of	experiment	.
so	 start 	 ing 	 	from	technology	,	technology	is	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	thing	.
when	that	apple	ii	came	out	,	it	 re 	 ally 	 	could	do	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
it	could	show	text	and	after	we	 wait 	 ed 	 	a	bit	,	we	had	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 image 	 s 	 	.
remember	when	 image 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	first	possible	with	a	computer	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 gorge 	 ous 	 	,	full	-	color	 image 	 s 	 	?
and	then	after	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	got	cd	-	quality	sound	.
it	was	 in 	 credible 	 	.	you	could	listen	to	sound	on	the	computer	.
and	then	 movie 	 s 	 	,	via	cd	-	rom	.	it	was	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
remember	that	 excit 	 ement 	 	?
and	then	the	 brow 	 s 	 er 	 	 appear 	 ed 	 	.	the	 brow 	 s 	 er 	 	was	great	,	but	the	 brow 	 s 	 er 	 	was	 ver 	 y 	 	primitive	,	 ver 	 y 	 	narrow	 band 	 width 	 	.
text	first	,	then	 image 	 s 	 	,	we	 wait 	 ed 	 	,	cd	-	quality	sound	over	the	net	,	then	 movie 	 s 	 	over	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.	kind	of	 in 	 credible 	 	.
and	then	the	mobile	phone	 occur 	 red 	 	,	text	,	 image 	 s 	 	,	audio	,	video	.	and	now	we	have	iphone	,	ipad	,	android	,	with	text	,	video	,	audio	,	etc	.
you	see	 th 	 is 	 	little	pattern	here	?
we	're	kind	of	 s 	 tuck 	 	in	a	loop	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	sense	of	 possibil 	 ity 	 	from	computing	is	 some 	 thing 	 	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 question 	 ing 	 	for	the	last	10	or	so	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	have	 look 	 ed 	 	to	design	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	understand	most	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	to	understand	design	with	our	technology	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	 pass 	 ion 	 	of	mine	.
and	i	have	a	small	experiment	to	give	you	a	quick	design	 less 	 on 	 	.
 design 	 ers 	 	talk	about	the	relationship	between	form	and	content	,	content	and	form	.	now	what	 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	?
well	,	content	is	the	word	up	there	:	fear	.	it	's	a	four	-	letter	word	.	it	's	a	kind	of	a	bad	 feel 	 ing 	 	word	,	fear	.
fear	is	set	in	light	helvetica	,	so	it	's	not	too	 stress 	 ful 	 	,	and	if	you	set	it	in	ultra	light	helvetica	,	it	's	like	,	``	oh	,	fear	,	who	 care 	 s 	 	?	``	right	?
you	take	the	same	ultra	light	helvetica	and	make	it	big	,	and	like	,	 who 	 a 	 	,	that	 hurt 	 s 	 	.	fear	.
so	you	can	see	how	you	change	the	scale	,	you	change
the	form	.	content	is	the	same	,	but	you	feel	 different 	 ly 	 	.
you	change	the	 type 	 face 	 	to	,	like	,	 th 	 is 	 	 type 	 face 	 	,	and	it	's	kind	of	funny	.	it	's	like	pirate	 type 	 face 	 	,	like	 cap 	 tain 	 	jack	 sp 	 arrow 	 	 type 	 face 	 	.	arr	!	fear	!
like	,	aww	,	that	's	not	 fear 	 ful 	 	.	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	funny	.
or	fear	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	kind	of	a	 night 	 club 	 	 type 	 face 	 	.	like	,	we	got	ta	go	to	fear	.
it	's	,	like	,	 amaz 	 ing 	 	,	right	?
it	just	 change 	 s 	 	the	same	content	.
or	you	make	it	--	the	 letter 	 s 	 	are	 separat 	 ed 	 	 a 	 part 	 	,	they	're	 huddl 	 ed 	 	together	like	on	the	deck	of	the	 titan 	 ic 	 	,	and	you	feel	sorry	for	the	 letter 	 s 	 	,	like	,	i	feel	the	fear	.
you	feel	for	them	.
or	you	change	the	 type 	 face 	 	to	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 class 	 y 	 	.	it	's	like	that	expensive	restaurant	,	fear	.
i	can	never	get	in	there	.
it	's	just	 amaz 	 ing 	 	,	fear	.	but	that	's	form	,	content	.
if	you	just	change	one	letter	in	that	content	,	you	get	a	much	better	word	,	much	better	content	:	free	.
``	free	``	is	a	great	word	.	you	can	serve	it	 al 	 most 	 	any	way	.
free	bold	 feel 	 s 	 	like	mandela	free	.
it	's	like	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	i	can	be	free	.
free	even	light	 feel 	 s 	 	kind	of	like	,	ah	,	i	can	breathe	in	free	.
it	 feel 	 s 	 	great	.	or	even	free	spread	out	,	it	's	like	,	ah	,	i	can	breathe	in	free	,	so	 eas 	 ily 	 	.
and	i	can	add	in	a	blue	 grad 	 ient 	 	and	a	dove	,	and	i	have	,	like	,	don	draper	free	.
so	you	see	that	--	form	,	content	,	design	,	it	 work 	 s 	 	that	way	.
it	's	a	 power 	 ful 	 	thing	.	it	's	like	magic	,	 al 	 most 	 	,	like	the	 magic 	 ians 	 	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	at	ted	.	it	's	magic	.
design	 do 	 es 	 	that	.
and	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 cur 	 ious 	 	about	how	design	and	technology	intersect	,	and	i	'm	going	to	show	you	some	old	work	i	never	 re 	 ally 	 	show	 any 	 more 	 	,	to	give	you	a	sense	of	what	i	used	to	do	.
so	--	 yea 	 h 	 	.
so	i	made	a	lot	of	work	in	the	'90s	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	square	that	 respond 	 s 	 	to	sound	.
people	ask	me	why	i	made	that	.	it	's	not	clear	.
but	i	thought	it	'd	be	neat	for	the	square	to	respond	to	me	,	and	my	 kid 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	small	then	,	and	my	 kid 	 s 	 	would	play	with	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	like	,	``	aaah	,	``	you	know	,	they	would	say	,	``	 d 	 addy 	 	,	aaah	,	aaah	.	``	you	know	,	like	that	.
we	'd	go	to	a	computer	store	,	and	they	'd	do	the	same	thing	.
and	they	'd	say	,	``	 d 	 addy 	 	,	why	 do 	 es 	 	n't	the	computer	respond	to	sound	?	``	and	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	at	the	time	i	was	 wonder 	 ing 	 	why	 do 	 es 	 	n't	the	computer	respond	to	sound	?
so	i	made	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	an	experiment	at	the	time	.
and	then	i	 s 	 pent 	 	a	lot	of	time	in	the	space	of	 inter 	 active 	 	 graphic 	 s 	 	and	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	i	 stop 	 ped 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	it	 be 	 cause 	 	my	 student 	 s 	 	at	mit	got	so	much	better	than	 my 	 self 	 	,	so	i	had	to	hang	up	my	mouse	.
but	in	'96	,	i	made	my	last	piece	.	it	was	in	black	and	white	,	monochrome	,	fully	monochrome	,	all	in	integer	 mathematic 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	tap	,	type	,	write	.	``
it	's	 pay 	 ing 	 	a	tribute	to	the	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 type 	 writer 	 	that	my	mother	used	to	type	on	all	the	time	 a 	 s 	 	a	legal	 secret 	 ary 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	10	 vari 	 ations 	 	.
there	's	a	shift	.
ten	 vari 	 ations 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	like	,	spin	the	letter	around	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	,	like	,	a	ring	of	 letter 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	20	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	so	it	's	kind	of	a	--
let	's	see	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	--
i	love	the	french	film	``	the	red	balloon	.	``
great	movie	,	right	?	i	love	that	movie	.	so	,
 th 	 is 	 	is	sort	of	like	a	play	on	that	.
it	's	 peace 	 ful 	 	,	like	that	.
i	'll	show	 th 	 is 	 	last	one	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	about	balance	,	you	know	.
it	's	kind	of	 stress 	 ful 	 	 ty 	 ping 	 	out	,	so	if	you	type	on	 th 	 is 	 	 key 	 board 	 	,	you	can	,	like	,	balance	it	out	.
if	you	hit	g	,	life	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	i	 al 	 ways 	 	say	,	``	hit	g	,	and	it	's	going	to	be	all	right	.
thank	you	.
thank	you	.
so	that	was	20	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	i	was	 al 	 ways 	 	on	the	 per 	 iph 	 ery 	 	of	art	.
by	 be 	 ing 	 	 p 	 resident 	 	of	risd	i	've	gone	deep	 in 	 to 	 	art	,	and	art	is	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	thing	,	fine	art	,	 pur 	 e 	 	art	.
you	know	,	when	people	say	,	``	i	do	n't	get	art	.	i	do	n't	get	it	at	all	.	``	that	 mean 	 s 	 	art	is	 work 	 ing 	 	,	you	know	?
it	's	like	,	art	is	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	 enigma 	 tic 	 	,	so	when	you	say	,	like	,	``	i	do	n't	get	it	,	``	like	,	oh	,	that	's	great	.
art	 do 	 es 	 	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	art	is	about	 ask 	 ing 	 	 question 	 s 	 	,	 question 	 s 	 	that	may	not	be	answerable	.
at	risd	,	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 facil 	 ity 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	edna	lawrence	nature	lab	.	it	 ha 	 s 	 	80,000	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	animal	,	bone	,	mineral	,	 plant 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	in	rhode	 is 	 land 	 	,	if	an	animal	 get 	 s 	 	hit	on	the	road	,	they	call	us	up	and	we	pick	it	up	and	stuff	it	.
and	why	do	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	 facil 	 ity 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	at	risd	,	you	have	to	look	at	the	actual	animal	,	the	object	,	to	understand	 it 	 s 	 	volume	,	to	perceive	it	.
at	risd	,	you	're	not	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	draw	from	an	image	.
and	 man 	 y 	 	people	ask	me	,	john	,	could	n't	you	just
 digit 	 ize 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	?	make	it	all	digital	?	would	n't	it	be	better	?
and	i	often	say	,	well	,	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	good	to	how	 thing 	 s 	 
used	to	be	 d 	 one 	 	.	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	different	about	it	,	 some 	 thing 	 	we	should	figure	out	what	is	good	about	how	we	did	it	,	even	in	 th 	 is 	 	new	era	.
and	i	have	a	good	friend	,	he	's	a	new	media	artist	named	tota	hasegawa	.	he	's	based	in	london	,	no	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	it	's	in	tokyo	,	but	when	he	was	based	in	london	,	he	had	a	game
with	his	wife	.	he	would	go	to	 anti 	 que 	 	 shop 	 s 	 	,	and	the	game	was	 a 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	:	when	we	look	at	an	 anti 	 que 	 	we	want	,	we	'll	ask	the	 shop 	 keeper 	 	for	the	story	 be 	 hind 	 	the	 anti 	 que 	 	,	and	if	it	's	a	good	story	,	we	'll	buy	it	.
so	they	'd	go	to	an	 anti 	 que 	 	shop	,	and	they	'd	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	cup	,	and	they	'd	say	,	``	tell	us	about	 th 	 is 	 	cup	.	``
and	the	 shop 	 keeper 	 	would	say	,	``	it	's	old	.	``
``	tell	us	more	.	``	``	oh	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	old	.	``
and	he	saw	,	over	and	over	,	the	 anti 	 que 	 	's	value	was	all	about	it	 be 	 ing 	 	old	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	a	new	media	artist	,	he	 reflect 	 ed 	 	,	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	you	know	,	i	've	 s 	 pent 	 	my	whole	 care 	 er 	 	making	new	media	art	.
people	say	,	``	 w 	 ow 	 	,	your	art	,	what	is	it	?	``	it	's	new	media	.
and	he	 real 	 ized 	 	,	it	is	n't	about	old	or	new	.
it	's	about	 some 	 thing 	 	in	between	.
it	is	n't	about	``	old	,	``	the	dirt	,	``	new	,	``	the	cloud	.	it	's	about	what	is	good	.
a	combination	of	the	cloud	and	the	dirt	is	where	the	action	is	at	.
you	see	it	in	all	 interest 	 ing 	 	art	 to 	 day 	 	,	in	all	 interest 	 ing 	 	 business 	 es 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.	how	we	combine
 t 	 hose 	 	two	together	to	make	good	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
so	art	 make 	 s 	 	 question 	 s 	 	,	and	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	 ask 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	 question 	 s 	 	.
we	are	n't	 function 	 ing 	 	so	 eas 	 ily 	 	 any 	 more 	 	.
we	are	n't	a	simple	 author 	 itarian 	 	regime	 any 	 more 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 author 	 itarianism 	 	,	i	was	in	russia	one	time	 travel 	 ing 	 	in	st.	petersburg	,	at	a	national	monument	,	and	i	saw	 th 	 is 	 	sign	that	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	do	not	walk	on	the	grass	,	``	and	i	thought	,	oh	,	i	mean	,	i	speak	english	,	and	you	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	single	me	out	.	that	's	not	fair	.
but	i	found	a	sign	for	russian	-	 s 	 peaking 	 	people	,	and	it	was	the	best	sign	ever	to	say	no	.
it	was	like	,	``	no	 swimm 	 ing 	 	,	no	 hik 	 ing 	 	,	no	 any 	 thing 	 	.	``
my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 one 	 s 	 	are	``	no	 plant 	 s 	 	.	``	why	would	you	 br 	 ing 	 	a	plant	to	a	national	monument	?	i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	.	and	 al 	 so 	 	``	no	love	.	``
so	that	is	 author 	 itarianism 	 	.
and	what	is	that	,	 structural 	 ly 	 	?
it	's	a	 hierarch 	 y 	 	.	we	all	know	that	a	 hierarch 	 y 	 	is	how	we	run	 man 	 y 	 	 system 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	we	know	,	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 disrupt 	 ed 	 	.
it	is	now	a	network	 in 	 stead 	 	of	a	perfect	tree	.
it	's	a	heterarchy	 in 	 stead 	 	of	a	 hierarch 	 y 	 	.	and	that	's	kind	of	awkward	.
and	so	 to 	 day 	 	,	 lead 	 ers 	 	are	 face 	 d 	 	with	how	to	lead	 different 	 ly 	 	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	work	i	did	with	my	 col 	 league 	 	becky	bermont	on	creative	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	.	what	can	we	learn	from	 artist 	 s 	 	and	 design 	 ers 	 	for	how	to	lead	?
 be 	 cause 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	 sense 	 s 	 	,	a	regular	 lead 	 er 	 	 love 	 s 	 	to	avoid	 mistak 	 es 	 	.
 some 	 one 	 	who	's	creative	 actual 	 ly 	 	 love 	 s 	 	to	learn	from	 mistak 	 es 	 	.
a	 tradition 	 al 	 	 lead 	 er 	 	is	 al 	 ways 	 	 want 	 ing 	 	to	be	right	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	a	creative	 lead 	 er 	 	 hope 	 s 	 	to	be	right	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	frame	is	 import 	 ant 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	complex	,	 ambigu 	 ous 	 	space	,	and	 artist 	 s 	 	and	 design 	 ers 	 	have	a	lot	to	teach	us	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	.
and	i	had	a	show	in	london	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	where	my	 friend 	 s 	 	 invit 	 ed 	 	me	to	come	to	london	for	four	 day 	 s 	 	to	 s 	 it 	 	in	a	 sand 	 box 	 	,	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	great	.
and	so	i	 s 	 at 	 	in	a	 sand 	 box 	 	for	four	 day 	 s 	 	straight	,	six	 hour 	 s 	 	every	day	,	six	-	minute	 appointment 	 s 	 	with	 any 	 one 	 	in	london	,	and	that	was	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	.
but	i	would	listen	to	people	,	hear	 the 	 ir 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	,	draw	in	the	sand	,	try	to	figure	 thing 	 s 	 	out	,	and	it	was	kind	of	hard	to	figure	out	what	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	.
you	know	?	it	's	all	these	one	-	on	-	one	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	for	like	four	 day 	 s 	 	.
and	it	felt	kind	of	like	 be 	 ing 	 	 p 	 resident 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
i	was	like	,	``	oh	,	 th 	 is 	 	my	job	.	 p 	 resident 	 	.	i	do	a	lot	of	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	you	know	?	``
and	by	the	end	of	the	experience	,	i	 real 	 ized 	 	why	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	,	what	we	do	is	we	connect	 im 	 prob 	 able 	 	 connect 	 ions 	 	and	hope	 some 	 thing 	 	will	happen	,	and	in	that	room	i	found	so	 man 	 y 	 	 connect 	 ions 	 	between	people	 a 	 cross 	 	all	of	london	,	and	so	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	,	 connect 	 ing 	 	people	,	is	the	great	question	 to 	 day 	 	.
 whet 	 her 	 	you	're	in	the	 hierarch 	 y 	 	or	the	heterarchy	,	it	's	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	design	 challeng 	 e 	 	.
and	one	thing	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	is	 do 	 ing 	 	some	research	on	 system 	 s 	 	that	can	combine	technology	and	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	with	an	art	and	design	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	.
let	me	show	you	 some 	 thing 	 	i	have	n't	 show 	 n 	 	 any 	 where 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
so	what	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	is	a	kind	of	a	sketch	,	an	application	sketch	i	wrote	in	python	.	you	know	how	there	's	photoshop	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	powershop	,	and	the	way	it	 work 	 s 	 	is	imagine	an	 organ 	 ization 	 	.	you	know	,	the	ceo	is	n't	ever
at	the	top	.	the	ceo	's	at	the	center	of	the	 organ 	 ization 	 	.
there	may	be	different	 sub 	 division 	 s 	 	in	the	 organ 	 ization 	 	,	and	you	might	want	to	look	 in 	 to 	 	different	 area 	 s 	 	.	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,
green	are	 area 	 s 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	well	,	red	are	 area 	 s 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 poor 	 ly 	 	.
you	know	,	how	do	you	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	 lead 	 er 	 	,	 s 	 can 	 	,	connect	,	make	 thing 	 s 	 	happen	?	so	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	you	might	open	up	a	 distribut 	 ion 	 	here	and	find	the	different	 sub 	 division 	 s 	 	in	there	,	and	know	that	you	know	 some 	 one 	 	in	eco	,	over	here	,	and	these	people	here	are	in	eco	,	the	people	you	might	engage	with	 a 	 s 	 	ceo	,	people	going	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 hierarch 	 y 	 	.
and	part	of	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	of	the	ceo	is	to	find	 connect 	 ions 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	 area 	 s 	 	,	and	so	you	might	look	in	r	&	d	,	and	here	you	see	one	person	who	 cross 	 es 	 	the	two	 area 	 s 	 	of	interest	,	and	it	's	a	person	 import 	 ant 	 	to	engage	.
so	you	might	want	to	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	get	a	 head 	 s 	 	-	up	 dis 	 play 	 	on	how	you	're	 interact 	 ing 	 	with	them	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	 coffee 	 s 	 	do	you	have	?
how	often	are	you	 call 	 ing 	 	them	,	 email 	 ing 	 	them	?
what	is	the	 ten 	 or 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	email	?	how	is	it	 work 	 ing 	 	out	?
 lead 	 ers 	 	might	be	able	to	use	these	 system 	 s 	 	to	better	 regulat 	 e 	 	how	they	work	 in 	 side 	 	the	heterarchy	.
you	can	 al 	 so 	 	imagine	using	technology	like	from	luminoso	,	the	 guy 	 s 	 	from	cambridge	who	 we 	 re 	 	looking	at	deep
text	analysis	.	what	is	the	 ten 	 or 	 	of	your	 communication 	 s 	 	?
so	these	kind	of	 system 	 s 	 	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	are	 import 	 ant 	 	.
they	're	 target 	 ed 	 	social	media	 system 	 s 	 	around	 lead 	 ers 	 	.
and	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	will	 on 	 ly 	 	begin	to	grow	 a 	 s 	 	more	 lead 	 ers 	 	enter	the	space	of	art	and	design	,	 be 	 cause 	 	art	and	design	lets	you	think	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	find	different	 system 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,
and	i	've	just	 beg 	 un 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	so	i	'm	glad	to	share	that	with	you	.
so	in	 clo 	 s 	 ing 	 	,	i	want	to	thank	all	of	you
for	your	attention	.	 thank 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
