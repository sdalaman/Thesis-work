on	my	desk	in	my	 off 	 ice 	 	,	i	keep	a	small	clay	pot	that	i	made	in	college	.	it	's	raku	,	which	is	a	kind	of	 potter 	 y 	 	that	 beg 	 an 	 	in	japan	centuries	ago	 a 	 s 	 	a	way	of	making	 bowl 	 s 	 	for	the	japanese	tea	 ce 	 re 	 mon 	 y 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	one	is	more	than	400	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
each	one	was	 pinch 	 ed 	 	or	 carv 	 ed 	 	out	of	a	ball	of	clay	,	and	it	was	the	 im 	 perfect 	 ions 	 	that	people	 cher 	 ish 	 ed 	 	.
 every 	 day 	 	 pot 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	cup	take	eight	to	10	 hour 	 s 	 	to	fire	.
i	just	took	 th 	 is 	 	out	of	the	kiln	last	week	,	and	the	kiln	 it 	 self 	 	 take 	 s 	 	 an 	 other 	 	day	or	two	to	cool	down	,	but	raku
is	 re 	 ally 	 	fast	.	you	do	it	 out 	 side 	 	,	and	you	take	the	kiln
up	to	temperature	.	in	15	 minute 	 s 	 	,	it	 go 	 es 	 	to	1,500	 degree 	 s 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	you	see	that	the	 glaz 	 e 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 melt 	 ed 	 	 in 	 side 	 	,	you	can	see	that	faint	 she 	 en 	 	,	you	turn	the	kiln	off	,	and	you	reach	in	with	these	long	metal	tongs	,	you	grab	the	pot	,	and	in	japan	,	 th 	 is 	 	red	-	hot	pot	would	be	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	 immers 	 ed 	 	in	a	solution	of	green	tea	,	and	you	can	imagine	what	that	 s 	 team 	 	would	smell	like	.
but	here	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	we	ramp	up	the	drama	a	little	bit	,	and	we	drop	our	 pot 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 saw 	 dust 	 	,	which	 catch 	 es 	 	on	fire	,	and	you	take	a	garbage	pail	,	and	you	put	it	on	top	,	and	smoke	 start 	 s 	 	 pour 	 ing 	 	out	.
i	would	come	home	with	my	 clothe 	 s 	 	reeking	of	woodsmoke	.
i	love	raku	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 allow 	 s 	 	me	to	play	with	the	 element 	 s 	 	.
i	can	shape	a	pot	out	of	clay	and	 choos 	 e 	 	a	 glaz 	 e 	 	,	but	then	i	have	to	let	it	go	to	the	fire	and	the	smoke	,	and	what	's	 wonder 	 ful 	 	is	the	 surprise 	 s 	 	that	happen	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	crackle	pattern	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 stress 	 ful 	 	on	these	 pot 	 s 	 	.	they	go	from	1,500	 degree 	 s 	 	to	room	temperature	in	the	space	of	just	a	minute	.
raku	is	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	metaphor	for	the	process	of	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	.
i	find	in	so	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	tension	between	what	i	can	control	and	what	i	have	to	let	go	 happen 	 s 	 	all	the	time	,	 whet 	 her 	 	i	'm	creating	a	new	radio	show	or	just	at	home	 negoti 	 ating 	 	with	my	 teen 	 age 	 	 son 	 s 	 	.
when	i	 s 	 at 	 	down	to	write	a	book	about	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	,	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	the	 step 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 revers 	 ed 	 	.
i	had	to	let	go	at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	and	i	had	to	 immers 	 e 	 	 my 	 self 	 	in	the	 st 	 ories 	 	of	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 artist 	 s 	 	and	 writer 	 s 	 	and	 music 	 ians 	 	and	 film 	 makers 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	i	 listen 	 ed 	 	to	these	 st 	 ories 	 	,	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	 grow 	 s 	 	out	of	 every 	 day 	 	 experience 	 s 	 	more	often	than	you	might	think	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 lett 	 ing 	 	go	.
it	was	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	break	,	but	that	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	that	's	part	of	the	 lett 	 ing 	 	go	,	is	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	it	 happen 	 s 	 	and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 grow 	 s 	 	from	the	broken	 place 	 s 	 	.
the	best	way	to	learn	about	 any 	 thing 	 	is	through	 st 	 ories 	 	,	and	so	i	want	to	tell	you	a	story	about	work	and	play	and	about	four	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	of	life	that	we	need	to	embrace	in	order	for	our	own	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	to	flourish	.
the	first	embrace	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	think	,	``	oh	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	,	``	but	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 hard 	 er 	 	,	and	that	's	 pay 	 ing 	 	attention	to	the	world	around	us	.
so	 man 	 y 	 	 artist 	 s 	 	speak	about	 need 	 ing 	 	to	be	open	,	to	embrace	experience	,	and	that	's	hard	to	do	when	you	have	a	 light 	 ed 	 	 rect 	 angle 	 	in	your	pocket	that	 take 	 s 	 	all	of	your	focus	.
the	 film 	 maker 	 	mira	nair	 speak 	 s 	 	about	growing	up	in	a	small	town	in	india	.	 it 	 s 	 	name	is	bhubaneswar	,	and	here	's	a	picture	of	one	of	the	 temple 	 s 	 	in	her	town	.
mira	nair	:	in	 th 	 is 	 	little	town	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	like	2,000	 temple 	 s 	 	.
we	 play 	 ed 	 	cricket	all	the	time	.	we	kind	of	grew	up	in	the	 rub 	 ble 	 	.	the	major	thing	that	inspired	me	,	that	led	me	on	 th 	 is 	 	path	,	that	made	me	a	 film 	 maker 	 	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	was	 travel 	 ing 	 	folk	theater	that	would	come	through	the	town	and	i	would	go	off	and	see	these	great	 battle 	 s 	 	of	good	and	 e 	 vil 	 	by	two	people	in	a	school	field	with	no	 prop 	 s 	 	but	with	a	lot	of	,	you	know	,	 pass 	 ion 	 	,	and	 hash 	 ish 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	and	it	was	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
you	know	,	the	folk	 tale 	 s 	 	of	mahabharata	and	ramayana	,	the	two	holy	 book 	 s 	 	,	the	 epic 	 s 	 	that	 every 	 thing 	 	 come 	 s 	 	out	of
in	india	,	they	say	.	after	 see 	 ing 	 	that	jatra	,	the	folk	theater	,	i	 k 	 new 	 	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	get	on	,	you	know	,	and	perform	.
julie	burstein	:	is	n't	that	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	story	?
you	can	see	the	sort	of	break	in	the	 every 	 day 	 	.
there	they	are	in	the	school	 field 	 s 	 	,	but	it	's	good	and	 e 	 vil 	 	,	and	 pass 	 ion 	 	and	 hash 	 ish 	 	.	and	mira	nair	was	a	young	girl	with	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	other	people	 watch 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	performance	,	but	she	was	ready	.	she	was	ready	to	open	up	to	what	it	 spark 	 ed 	 	in	her	,	and	it	led	her	,	 a 	 s 	 	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	down	 th 	 is 	 	path	to	 be 	 come 	 	an	 a 	 ward 	 	-	winning	 film 	 maker 	 	.
so	 be 	 ing 	 	open	for	that	experience	that	might	change	you	is	the	first	thing	we	need	to	embrace	.

it	's	from	1656	,	and	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	las	meninas	,	``	and	it	's	the	picture	of	a	little	 prince 	 s 	 s 	 	and	her	 lad 	 ies 	 	-	in	-	 wait 	 ing 	 	,	and	if	you	look	over	that	little	blonde	 prince 	 s 	 s 	 	's	shoulder	,	you	'll	see	a	mirror	,	and	 reflect 	 ed 	 	in	it	are	her	 parent 	 s 	 	,	the	king	and	 que 	 en 	 	of	spain	,	who	would	be	 stand 	 ing 	 	where	you	might	stand	to	look	at	the	picture	.
 a 	 s 	 	he	often	did	,	velázquez	put	 him 	 self 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 	too	.
he	's	 stand 	 ing 	 	on	the	left	with	his	 paint 	 brush 	 	in	one	hand	and	his	 pal 	 ette 	 	in	the	other	.
richard	serra	:	i	was	 stand 	 ing 	 	there	looking	at	it	,	and	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	velázquez	was	looking	at	me	,	and	i	thought	,	``	oh	.	i	'm	the	subject	of	the	 paint 	 ing 	 	.	``
and	i	thought	,	``	i	'm	not	going	to	be	able	to	do	that	 paint 	 ing 	 	.	``
i	was	to	the	point	where	i	was	using	a	 stop 	 watch 	 	and	 paint 	 ing 	 	 square 	 s 	 	out	of	 random 	 ness 	 	,	and	i	was	n't	 get 	 ting 	 	 any 	 where 	 	.	so	i	went	back	and	 dump 	 ed 	 	all	my	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	in	the	arno	,	and	i	thought	,	i	'm	going	to	just	start	 play 	 ing 	 	around	.
jb	:	richard	serra	 say 	 s 	 	that	so	nonchalantly	,	you	might
have	 mis 	 s 	 ed 	 	it	.	he	went	and	saw	 th 	 is 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 	by	a	guy	who	'd	 be 	 en 	 	dead	for	300	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	 real 	 ized 	 	,	``	i	ca	n't	do	that	,	``	and	so	richard	serra	went	back	to	his	studio	in	florence	,	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	all	of	his	work	up	to	that	point	,	and	threw	it	in	a	river	.
richard	serra	let	go	of	 paint 	 ing 	 	at	that	moment	,	but	he	did	n't	let	go	of	art	.	he	 move 	 d 	 	to	new	york	city	,	and	he	put	together	a	list	of	 verb 	 s 	 	--	to	roll	,	to	crease	,	to	fold	--
more	than	a	hundred	of	them	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	he	just	 start 	 ed 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	around	.	he	did	these	 thing 	 s 	 	to	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	material	.	he	would	take	a	huge	sheet	of	lead	and	roll	it	up	and	 un 	 roll 	 	it	.	he	would	do	the	same	thing	to	rubber	,	and	when	he	got	to	the	direction	``	to	lift	,	``	he	 create 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	which	is	in	the	museum	of	modern	art	.
richard	serra	had	to	let	go	of	 paint 	 ing 	 	in	order	to	embark	on	 th 	 is 	 	 play 	 ful 	 	exploration	that	led	him	to	the	work	that	he	's	known	for	 to 	 day 	 	:	huge	 curv 	 es 	 	of	steel	that	 requir 	 e 	 	our	time	and	motion	to	experience	.	in	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	,	richard	serra	is	able	to	do	what	he	could	n't	do	in	 paint 	 ing 	 	.
he	 make 	 s 	 	us	the	subject	of	his	art	.

there	's	a	fourth	embrace	,	and	it	's	the	 hard 	 est 	 	.
it	's	the	embrace	of	loss	,	the	 old 	 est 	 	and	most	constant	of	human	 experience 	 s 	 	.
in	order	to	create	,	we	have	to	stand	in	that	space	between	what	we	see	in	the	world	and	what	we	hope	for	,	looking	 square 	 ly 	 	at	 reject 	 ion 	 	,	at	 heart 	 break 	 	,	at	war	,	at	death	.
that	's	a	tough	space	to	stand	in	.

i	mean	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	 afternoon 	 s 	 	i	was	down	there	,	and	the	light	 go 	 es 	 	pink	and	there	's	a	 mis 	 t 	 	in	the	air	and	you	're	 stand 	 ing 	 	in	the	 rub 	 ble 	 	,	and	i	found	 my 	 self 	 	 recogn 	 izing 	 	both	the	inherent	 beaut 	 y 	 	of	nature	and	the	fact	that	nature	,	 a 	 s 	 	time	,	is	 era 	 s 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	wound	.
time	is	 un 	 stop 	 p 	 able 	 	,	and	it	 transform 	 s 	 	the	event	.
it	 get 	 s 	 	further	and	further	away	from	the	day	,	and	light	and	 season 	 s 	 	temper	it	in	some	way	,
and	it	's	not	that	i	'm	a	romantic	.	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	a	 re 	 alist 	 	.
the	 re 	 ality 	 	is	,	there	's	the	woolworth	building	in	a	veil	of	smoke	from	the	 s 	 ite 	 	,	but	it	's	now	like	a	scrim	 a 	 cross 	 	a	theater	,	and	it	's	 turn 	 ing 	 	pink	,	you	know	,	and	down	 be 	 low 	 	there	are	 hose 	 s 	 	 spray 	 ing 	 	,	and	the	 light 	 s 	 	have	come	on	for	the	 even 	 ing 	 	,	and	the	water	is	 turn 	 ing 	 	acid	green	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 so 	 d 	 ium 	 	 lamp 	 s 	 	are	on	,	and	i	'm	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	my	god	,	who	could	dream	 th 	 is 	 	up	?	``	but	the	fact	is	,	i	'm	there	,	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	that	,	you	have	to	take	a	picture	.
jb	:	you	have	to	take	a	picture	.	that	sense	of	 urge 	 ncy 	 	,	of	the	need	to	get	to	work	,	is	so	 power 	 ful 	 	in	joel	's	story	.
when	i	saw	joel	meyerowitz	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	i	told	him	how	much	i	 admire 	 d 	 	his	passionate	obstinacy	,	his	 determi 	 nation 	 	to	push	through	all	the	 bureaucrat 	 ic 	 	red	tape	to	get	to	work	,	and	he	 laugh 	 ed 	 	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'm	 s 	 tub 	 born 	 	,	but	i	think	what	's	more	 import 	 ant 	 	is	my	passionate	 optim 	 ism 	 	.	``
the	first	time	i	told	these	 st 	 ories 	 	,	a	man	in	the	audience	raised	his	hand	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	all	these	 artist 	 s 	 	talk	about	 the 	 ir 	 	work	,	not	 the 	 ir 	 	art	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	got	me	 think 	 ing 	 	about	my	work	and	where	the	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	is	there	,
and	i	'm	not	an	artist	.	``	he	's	right	.	we	all	 wrestl 	 e 	 	with	experience	and	 challeng 	 e 	 	,	 limit 	 s 	 	and	loss	.
 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	is	essential	to	all	of	us	,	 whet 	 her 	 	we	're	 scientist 	 s 	 	or	 teacher 	 s 	 	,	 parent 	 s 	 	or	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	.
i	want	to	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	 an 	 other 	 	image	of	a	japanese	tea	bowl	.	 th 	 is 	 	one
is	at	the	 free 	 r 	 	 gall 	 ery 	 	in	washington	,	d.c	.
it	's	more	than	a	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	old	and	you	can	still	see	the	fingermarks	where	the	potter	 pinch 	 ed 	 	it	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	 al 	 so 	 	see	,	 th 	 is 	 	one	did	break	at	some	point	in	 it 	 s 	 	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	.
but	the	person	who	put	it	back	together	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 hid 	 ing 	 	the	 crack 	 s 	 	,	 decide 	 d 	 	to	 emphas 	 ize 	 	them	,	using	gold	lacquer	to	repair	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	bowl	is	more	 beaut 	 iful 	 	now	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	 be 	 en 	 	broken	,	than	it	was	when	it	was	first	made	,	and	we	can	look	at	 t 	 hose 	 	 crack 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	tell	the	story	that	we	all	live	,	of	the	cycle	of	creation	and	 destruct 	 ion 	 	,	of	control	and	 lett 	 ing 	 	go	,	of	 pick 	 ing 	 	up	the	 piece 	 s 	 	and	making	 some 	 thing 	 	new	.
thank	you	.
