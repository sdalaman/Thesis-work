fifteen	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	it	was	 wide 	 ly 	 	 assum 	 ed 	 	that	the	vast	 major 	 ity 	 	of	brain	 develop 	 ment 	 	 take 	 s 	 	place	in	the	first	few	 year 	 s 	 	of	life	.
back	then	,	15	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	we	did	n't	have	the	ability	to	look	 in 	 side 	 	the	living	human	brain	and	track	 develop 	 ment 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 life 	 span 	 	.
in	the	past	decade	or	so	,	 main 	 ly 	 	due	to	 advance 	 s 	 	in	brain	 im 	 aging 	 	technology	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 magnet 	 ic 	 	 reson 	 ance 	 	 im 	 aging 	 	,	or	mri	,	 neuro 	 scientist 	 s 	 	have	 start 	 ed 	 	to	look	 in 	 side 	 	the	living	human	brain	of	all	 age 	 s 	 	,	and	to	track	 change 	 s 	 	in	brain	structure	and	brain	function	,	so	we	use	structural	mri	if	you	'd	like	to	take	a	 snap 	 shot 	 	,	a	photograph	,	at	 re 	 ally 	 	high	 re 	 solution 	 	of	the	 in 	 side 	 	of	the	living	human	brain	,	and	we	can	ask	 question 	 s 	 	like	,	how	much	gray	matter	 do 	 es 	 	the	brain	contain	,	and	how	 do 	 es 	 	that	change	with	age	?
and	we	 al 	 so 	 	use	functional	mri	,	 call 	 ed 	 	fmri	,	to	take	a	video	,	a	movie	,	of	brain	activity	when	 particip 	 ants 	 	are	taking	part	in	some	kind	of	task	like	 think 	 ing 	 	or	 feel 	 ing 	 	or	 per 	 ceiv 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	.
so	 man 	 y 	 	 lab 	 s 	 	around	the	world	are	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	research	,	and	we	now	have	a	 re 	 ally 	 	rich	and	 detail 	 ed 	 	picture	of	how	the	living	human	brain	 develop 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	picture	 ha 	 s 	 	 radical 	 ly 	 	 change 	 d 	 	the	way	we	think	about	human	brain	 develop 	 ment 	 	by	 reveal 	 ing 	 	that	it	's	not	all	over	in	early	 child 	 hood 	 	,	and	 in 	 stead 	 	,	the	brain	 continu 	 es 	 	to	develop	right	 through 	 out 	 	adolescence	and	 in 	 to 	 	the	'20s	and	'30s	.
so	adolescence	is	defined	 a 	 s 	 	the	period	of	life	that	 start 	 s 	 	with	the	 bio 	 logical 	 	,	hormonal	,	physical	 change 	 s 	 	of	puberty	and	 end 	 s 	 	at	the	age	at	which	an	individual	 attain 	 s 	 	a	 s 	 table 	 	,	 in 	 dependent 	 	role	in	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
it	can	go	on	a	long	time	.
one	of	the	brain	 region 	 s 	 	that	 change 	 s 	 	most	 dramat 	 ically 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	adolescence	is	 call 	 ed 	 	 pre 	 frontal 	 	cortex	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	model	of	the	human	brain	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 pre 	 frontal 	 	cortex	,	right	at	the	front	.
 pre 	 frontal 	 	cortex	is	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	brain	area	.
it	's	 proportion 	 ally 	 	much	 big 	 ger 	 	in	 human 	 s 	 	than	in	any	other	species	,	and	it	's	 involve 	 d 	 	in	a	whole	range	of	high	level	cognitive	 function 	 s 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	like	decision	-	making	,	 plan 	 ning 	 	,	 plan 	 ning 	 	what	you	're	going	to	do	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	or	next	week	or	next	year	,	 inhibit 	 ing 	 	 in 	 appropriate 	 	behavior	,	so	 stop 	 ping 	 	 your 	 self 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	rude	or	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	stupid	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	social	 interact 	 ion 	 	,	 understand 	 ing 	 	other	people	,	and	self	-	 aware 	 ness 	 	.
so	mri	 stud 	 ies 	 	looking	at	the	 develop 	 ment 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	region	have	 show 	 n 	 	that	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 under 	 go 	 es 	 	 dramat 	 ic 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	period	of	adolescence	.
so	if	you	look	at	gray	matter	volume	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	gray	matter	volume	 a 	 cross 	 	age	from	age	four	to	22	 year 	 s 	 	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	 child 	 hood 	 	,	which	is	what	you	can	see
on	 th 	 is 	 	graph	.	it	 peak 	 s 	 	in	early	adolescence	.
the	 arrow 	 s 	 	 indic 	 ate 	 	peak	gray	matter	volume	in	 pre 	 frontal 	 	cortex	.	you	can	see	that	that	peak	 happen 	 s 	 	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	in	 boy 	 s 	 	 relat 	 ive 	 	to	 girl 	 s 	 	,	and	that	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 boy 	 s 	 	go	through	puberty	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	than	 girl 	 s 	 	on	average	,	and	then	 dur 	 ing 	 	adolescence	,	there	's	a	significant	decline	in	gray	matter	volume	in	 pre 	 frontal 	 	cortex	.
now	that	might	sound	bad	,	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 develop 	 mental 	 	process	,	 be 	 cause 	 	gray	matter	 contain 	 s 	 	cell	bodies	and	 connect 	 ions 	 	between	 cell 	 s 	 	,	the	 synapse 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	decline	in	gray	matter	volume	 dur 	 ing 	 	 pre 	 frontal 	 	cortex	is	thought	to	correspond	to	 syn 	 apt 	 ic 	 	pruning	,	the	 elimi 	 nation 	 	of	 un 	 want 	 ed 	 	 synapse 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	process	.	it	's	 part 	 ly 	 	dependent	on	the	environment	that	the	animal	or	the	human	is	in	,
and	the	 synapse 	 s 	 	that	are	 be 	 ing 	 	used	are	 strength 	 ened 	 	,	and	 synapse 	 s 	 	that	are	n't	 be 	 ing 	 	used	in	that	 part 	 icular 	 	environment	are	pruned	away	.
you	can	think	of	it	a	bit	like	pruning	a	 rose 	 bush 	 	.
you	prune	away	the	 weak 	 er 	 	 branch 	 es 	 	so	that	the	 remain 	 ing 	 	,	 import 	 ant 	 	 branch 	 es 	 	,	can	grow	 strong 	 er 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	process	,	which	 effective 	 ly 	 	fine	-	 tune 	 s 	 	brain	tissue	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	the	species	-	specific	environment	,	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	 pre 	 frontal 	 	cortex	and	in	other	brain	 region 	 s 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	period	of	human	adolescence	.
so	a	second	line	of	 inquir 	 y 	 	that	we	use	to	track	 change 	 s 	 	in	the	adolescent	brain	is	using	functional	mri	to	look	at	 change 	 s 	 	in	brain	activity	 a 	 cross 	 	age	.
so	i	'll	just	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	from	my	lab	.
so	in	my	lab	,	we	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	social	brain	,	that	is	the	network	of	brain	 region 	 s 	 	that	we	use	to	understand	other	people	and	to	interact	with	other	people	.
so	i	like	to	show	a	photograph	of	a	soccer	game	to	 illustr 	 ate 	 	two	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	of	how	your	social	 brain 	 s 	 	work	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	soccer	game	.
michael	owen	 ha 	 s 	 	just	 mis 	 s 	 ed 	 	a	goal	,	and	he	's	 ly 	 ing 	 	on	the	ground	,	and	the	first	 a 	 spect 	 	of	the	social	brain	that	 th 	 is 	 	picture	 re 	 ally 	 	 nice 	 ly 	 	 illustr 	 ates 	 	is	how	 autom 	 atic 	 	and	 instinct 	 ive 	 	social	 emotion 	 al 	 	 respons 	 es 	 	are	,
so	 with 	 in 	 	a	split	second	of	michael	owen	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	goal	,	 every 	 one 	 	is	 do 	 ing 	 	the	same	thing	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 arm 	 s 	 	and	the	same	thing	with	 the 	 ir 	 	face	,	even	michael	owen	 a 	 s 	 	he	 slide 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	the	grass	,	is	 do 	 ing 	 	the	same	thing	with	his	 arm 	 s 	 	,	and	 pre 	 sum 	 ably 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	similar	 fa 	 cial 	 	 express 	 ion 	 	,	and	the	 on 	 ly 	 	people	who	do	n't	are	the	 guy 	 s 	 	in	yellow	at	the	back	--	--	and	i	think	they	're	on	the	wrong	end	of	the	 stad 	 ium 	 	,	and	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	 an 	 other 	 	social	 emotion 	 al 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	that	we	all	 instant 	 ly 	 	 recogn 	 ize 	 	,	and	that	's	the	second	 a 	 spect 	 	of	the	social	brain	that	 th 	 is 	 	picture	 re 	 ally 	 	 nice 	 ly 	 	 illustr 	 ates 	 	,	how	good	we	are	at	 read 	 ing 	 	other	people	's	behavior	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 action 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 gest 	 ures 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 fa 	 cial 	 	 express 	 ions 	 	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	 emotion 	 s 	 	and	mental	 state 	 s 	 	.
so	you	do	n't	have	to	ask	any	of	these	 guy 	 s 	 	.
you	have	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	idea	of	what	they	're	 feel 	 ing 	 	and	 think 	 ing 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	precise	moment	in	time	.
so	that	's	what	we	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	looking	at	in	my	lab	.
so	in	my	lab	,	we	 br 	 ing 	 	 adolescent 	 s 	 	and	 adult 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	lab	to	have	a	brain	 s 	 can 	 	,	we	give	them	some	kind	of	task	that	 involve 	 s 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	other	people	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 mind 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	mental	 state 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 emotion 	 s 	 	,	and	one	of	the	 find 	 ing 	 s 	 	that	we	've	found	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 time 	 s 	 	now	,	 a 	 s 	 	have	other	 lab 	 s 	 	around	the	world	,	is	part	of	the	 pre 	 frontal 	 	cortex	 call 	 ed 	 	 media 	 l 	 	 pre 	 frontal 	 	cortex	,	which	is	 show 	 n 	 	in	blue	on	the	slide	,	and	it	's	right	in	the	middle	of	 pre 	 frontal 	 	cortex	in	the	 mid 	 line 	 	of	your	head	.
 th 	 is 	 	region	is	more	active	in	 adolescent 	 s 	 	when	they	make	these	social	 decision 	 s 	 	and	think	about	other	people
than	it	is	in	 adult 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	meta	-	analysis	of	nine	different	 stud 	 ies 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	area	from	 lab 	 s 	 	around	the	world	,	and	they	all	show	the	same	thing	,	that	activity	in	 th 	 is 	 	 media 	 l 	 	 pre 	 frontal 	 	cortex	area	 de 	 crease 	 s 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	period	of	adolescence	.
and	we	think	that	might	be	 be 	 cause 	 	 adolescent 	 s 	 	and	 adult 	 s 	 	use	a	different	mental	approach	,	a	different	cognitive	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	,	to	make	social	 decision 	 s 	 	,
and	one	way	of	looking	at	that	is	to	do	 behavior 	 al 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	 where 	 by 	 	we	 br 	 ing 	 	people	 in 	 to 	 	the	lab	and	we	give	them	some	kind	of	 behavior 	 al 	 	task	,	and	i	'll	just	give	you
 an 	 other 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	the	kind	of	task	that	we	use	in	my	lab	.
so	imagine	that	you	're	the	 particip 	 ant 	 	in	one	of	our
 experiment 	 s 	 	.	you	come	 in 	 to 	 	the	lab	,	you	see	 th 	 is 	 	 computer 	 ized 	 	task	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	task	,	you	see	a	set	of	 shelv 	 es 	 	.
now	,	there	are	 object 	 s 	 	on	these	 shelv 	 es 	 	,	on	some	of	them	,	and	you	'll	notice	there	's	a	guy	 stand 	 ing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	the	set	of	 shelv 	 es 	 	,	and	there	are	some	 object 	 s 	 	that	he	ca	n't	see	.
they	're	 oc 	 clud 	 ed 	 	,	from	his	point	of	view	,	with	a	kind	of	gray	piece	of	wood	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	same	set	of	 shelv 	 es 	 	from	his	point	of	view	.
notice	that	there	are	 on 	 ly 	 	some	 object 	 s 	 	that	he	can	see	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	more	 object 	 s 	 	that	you	can	see	.
now	your	task	is	to	move	 object 	 s 	 	around	.
the	director	,	 stand 	 ing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	the	set	of	 shelv 	 es 	 	,	is	going	to	direct	you	to	move	 object 	 s 	 	around	,	but	remember	,	he	's	not	going	to	ask	you	to	move	 object 	 s 	 
that	he	ca	n't	see	.	 th 	 is 	 	 introduc 	 es 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	condition	 where 	 by 	 	there	's	a	kind	of	conflict	between	your	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	and	the	director	's	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	.
so	imagine	he	 tell 	 s 	 	you	to	move	the	top	truck	left	.
there	are	three	 truck 	 s 	 	there	.	you	're	going	to	 instinct 	 ively 	 	go	for	the	white	truck	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	the	top	truck	from	your	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	but	then	you	have	to	remember	,	``	oh	,	he	ca	n't	see	that	truck	,	so	he	must	mean	me	to	move	the	blue	truck	,	``	which	is	the	top	truck
from	his	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	.	now	 believ 	 e 	 	it	or	not	,	normal	,	 health 	 y 	 	,	intelligent	 adult 	 s 	 	like	you	make	 error 	 s 	 	about	50	percent	of	the	time	on	that	kind	of	trial	.
they	move	the	white	truck	 in 	 stead 	 	of	the	blue	truck	.
so	we	give	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	task	to	 adolescent 	 s 	 	and	 adult 	 s 	 	,	and	we	 al 	 so 	 	have	a	control	condition	where	there	's	no	director	and	 in 	 stead 	 	we	give	people	a	rule	.
we	tell	them	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	we	're	going	to	do	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	thing	but	 th 	 is 	 	time	there	's	no	director	.	 in 	 stead 	 	you	've	got	to
 ignor 	 e 	 	 object 	 s 	 	with	the	dark	gray	 back 	 ground 	 	.
you	'll	see	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	condition	,	 on 	 ly 	 	in	the	no	-	director	condition	they	just	have	to	remember	to	 app 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 some 	 what 	 	 arbitr 	 ary 	 	rule	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	in	the	director	condition	,	they	have	to	remember	to	take	 in 	 to 	 	account	the	director	's	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	in	order	to	guide	 the 	 ir 	 	 on 	 going 	 	behavior	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	if	i	just	show	you	the	 percent 	 age 	 	 error 	 s 	 	in	a	large	 develop 	 mental 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	we	did	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	in	a	 stud 	 y 	 	ranging	from	age	seven	to	 adult 	 hood 	 	,	and	what	you	're	going	to	see	is	the	 percent 	 age 	 	 error 	 s 	 	in	the	adult	group	in	both	 condition 	 s 	 	,
so	the	gray	is	the	director	condition	,	and	you	see	that	our	intelligent	 adult 	 s 	 	are	making	 error 	 s 	 	about	50	percent	of	the	time	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	they	make	far	 few 	 er 	 	 error 	 s 	 	when	there	's	no	director	present	,	when	they	just	have	to	remember	that	rule	of	 ignor 	 ing 	 	the	gray	 back 	 ground 	 	.
 develop 	 ment 	 ally 	 	,	these	two	 condition 	 s 	 	develop	in	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	way	.	between	late	 child 	 hood 	 	and	mid	-	adolescence	,	there	's	an	 improve 	 ment 	 	,	in	other	 word 	 s 	 	a	 r 	 eduction 	 	of	 error 	 s 	 	,	in	both	of	these	 trial 	 s 	 	,	in	both	of	these	 condition 	 s 	 	.
but	it	's	when	you	 compar 	 e 	 	the	last	two	 group 	 s 	 	,	the	mid	-	adolescent	group	and	the	adult	group	where	 thing 	 s 	 	get	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	,	there	is	no	 continu 	 ed 	 	 improve 	 ment 	 	in	the	no	-	director	condition	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	you	need	to	do	in	order	to	remember	the	rule	and	 app 	 ly 	 	it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	fully	 develop 	 ed 	 	by	mid	-	adolescence	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	in	contrast	,	if	you	look	at	the	last	two	gray	 bar 	 s 	 	,	there	's	still	a	significant	 improve 	 ment 	 	in	the	director	condition	between	mid	-	adolescence	and	 adult 	 hood 	 	,	and	what	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	is	that	the	ability	to	take	 in 	 to 	 	account	 some 	 one 	 	else	's	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	in	order	to	guide	 on 	 going 	 	behavior	,	which	is	 some 	 thing 	 	,	by	the	way	,	that	we	do	in	 every 	 day 	 	life	all	the	time	,	is	still	 develop 	 ing 	 	in	mid	-	to	-	late	adolescence	.
so	if	you	have	a	 teen 	 age 	 	son	or	a	daughter	and	you	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	think	they	have	 problem 	 s 	 	taking	other	people	's
 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 s 	 	,	you	're	right	.	they	do	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	why	.
so	we	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	laugh	about	 teenager 	 s 	 	.
they	're	 paro 	 di 	 ed 	 	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	even	demonized	in	the	media	for	 the 	 ir 	 	kind	of	typical	 teen 	 age 	 	behavior	.	they	take	 risk 	 s 	 	,	they	're	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	moody	,	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	self	-	conscious	.
i	have	a	 re 	 ally 	 	nice	anecdote	from	a	friend	of	mine	who	 s 	 aid 	 	that	the	thing	he	 notice 	 d 	 	most	about	his	 teen 	 age 	 	 daughter 	 s 	 	before	and	after	puberty	was	 the 	 ir 	 	level	of	 embarrass 	 ment 	 	in	front	of	him	.
so	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	before	puberty	,	if	my	two	 daughter 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 mess 	 ing 	 	around	in	a	shop	,	i	'd	say	,	'	 he 	 y 	 	,	stop	 mess 	 ing 	 	around	and	i	'll	 s 	 ing 	 	your	 favor 	 ite 	 	song	,	'	and	 instant 	 ly 	 	they	'd	stop	 mess 	 ing 	 	around	and	he	'd	 s 	 ing 	 
 the 	 ir 	 	 favor 	 ite 	 	song	.	after	puberty	,	that	 be 	 came 	 	the	threat	.
the	 ver 	 y 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	dad	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	in	public	was	 en 	 ough 	 	to	make	them	 behav 	 e 	 	.
so	people	often	ask	,	``	well	,	is	adolescence	a	kind	of	 re 	 cent 	 	 phenomen 	 on 	 	?
is	it	 some 	 thing 	 	we	've	 invent 	 ed 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	in	the	west	?	``	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	the	answer	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	not	.	there	are	 lot 	 s 	 
of	 de 	 script 	 ions 	 	of	adolescence	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	that	sound	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	to	the	 de 	 script 	 ions 	 	we	use	 to 	 day 	 	.
so	there	's	a	famous	quote	by	shakespeare	from	``	the	winter	's	tale	``	where	he	 de 	 scribe 	 s 	 	adolescence	 a 	 s 	 	 follow 	 s 	 	:	``	i	would	there	 we 	 re 	 	no	age	between	ten	and	three	-	and	-	twenty	,	or	that	youth	would	sleep	out	the	rest	;	for	there	is	 noth 	 ing 	 	in	the	between	but	 get 	 ting 	 	wenches	with	child	,	wronging	the	ancientry	,	 steal 	 ing 	 	,	 fight 	 ing 	 	.	``
he	then	 go 	 es 	 	on	to	say	,	``	 hav 	 ing 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	that	,	would	any	but	these	 boil 	 ed 	 	 brain 	 s 	 	of	 nine 	 teen 	 	and	two	-	and	-	twenty	hunt	in	 th 	 is 	 	weather	?	``	so	 al 	 most 	 	400	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	shakespeare	was	portraying	 adolescent 	 s 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	light	to	the	light	that	we	 port 	 ray 	 	them	in	 to 	 day 	 	,	but	 to 	 day 	 	we	try	to	understand	 the 	 ir 	 	behavior	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	 change 	 s 	 	that	are	going	on	in	 the 	 ir 	 	brain	.
so	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	take	risk	-	taking	.	we	know	that	 adolescent 	 s 	 	have	a	 tend 	 ency 	 	to	take	 risk 	 s 	 	.	they	do	.
they	take	more	 risk 	 s 	 	than	children	or	 adult 	 s 	 	,	and	they	are	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	prone	to	taking	 risk 	 s 	 	when	they	're	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	.	there	's	an	 import 	 ant 	 	drive	to	 be 	 come 	 	 in 	 dependent 	 	from	one	's	 parent 	 s 	 	and	to	impress	one	's	 friend 	 s 	 	in	adolescence	.
but	now	we	try	to	understand	that	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	 develop 	 ment 	 	of	a	part	of	 the 	 ir 	 	brain	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 limb 	 ic 	 	system	,
so	i	'm	going	to	show	you	the	 limb 	 ic 	 	system	in	red	in	the	slide	 be 	 hind 	 	me	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	brain	.
so	the	 limb 	 ic 	 	system	is	right	deep	 in 	 side 	 	the	brain	,	and	it	's	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 thing 	 s 	 	like	emotion	 process 	 ing 	 	and	reward	 process 	 ing 	 	.	it	 give 	 s 	 	you	the	 reward 	 ing 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	out	of	 do 	 ing 	 	 f 	 un 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	taking	 risk 	 s 	 	.
it	 give 	 s 	 	you	the	kick	out	of	taking	 risk 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	region	,	the	 region 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	 limb 	 ic 	 	system	,	have	 be 	 en 	 	found	to	be	hypersensitive	to	the	 reward 	 ing 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	risk	-	taking	in	 adolescent 	 s 	 	 compar 	 ed 	 	with	 adult 	 s 	 	,
and	at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	same	time	,	the	 pre 	 frontal 	 	cortex	,	which	you	can	see	in	blue	in	the	slide	here	,	which	 stop 	 s 	 	us	taking	 excess 	 ive 	 	 risk 	 s 	 	,	is	still	 ver 	 y 	 	much	in	 develop 	 ment 	 	in	 adolescent 	 s 	 	.
so	brain	research	 ha 	 s 	 	 show 	 n 	 	that	the	adolescent	brain	 under 	 go 	 es 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 pro 	 found 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 implic 	 ations 	 	for	education	,	for	 rehabilit 	 ation 	 	,
and	intervention	.	the	environment	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 teach 	 ing 	 	,	can	and	 do 	 es 	 	shape	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	adolescent	brain	,	and	yet	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	 relat 	 ively 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	that	we	have	 be 	 en 	 	 routine 	 ly 	 	 educ 	 ating 	 	 teenager 	 s 	 	in	the	west	.
all	four	of	my	 grand 	 parent 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	left	school	in	 the 	 ir 	 	early	adolescence	.	they	had	no	choice	.
and	that	's	still	the	case	for	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 teenager 	 s 	 	around	the	world	 to 	 day 	 	.	forty	percent	of	 teenager 	 s 	 	do	n't	have	access	to	 second 	 ary 	 	school	education	.
and	yet	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	period	of	life	where	the	brain	is	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 adapt 	 able 	 	and	 malle 	 able 	 	.
it	's	a	fantastic	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	for	 learn 	 ing 	 	and	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	.
so	what	's	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 s 	 een 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	problem	with	 adolescent 	 s 	 	--	 height 	 ened 	 	risk	-	taking	,	poor	impulse	control	,	self	-	 conscious 	 ness 	 	--	should	n't	be	 stigma 	 t 	 ized 	 	.
it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 reflect 	 s 	 	 change 	 s 	 	in	the	brain	that	provide	an	 excel 	 lent 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	for	education
