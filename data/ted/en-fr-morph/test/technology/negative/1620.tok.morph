hi	.	i	'm	here	to	talk	about	 con 	 gest 	 ion 	 	,	 name 	 ly 	 	road	 con 	 gest 	 ion 	 	.
road	 con 	 gest 	 ion 	 	is	a	pervasive	 phenomen 	 on 	 	.
it	 exist 	 s 	 	in	 bas 	 ically 	 	all	of	the	cities	all	around	the	world	,	which	is	a	little	bit	surprising	when	you	think	about	it	.
i	mean	,	think	about	how	different	cities	are	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
i	mean	,	you	have	the	typical	european	cities	,	with	a	dense	urban	core	,	good	public	 transport 	 ation 	 	 most 	 ly 	 	,	not	a	lot	of	road	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	.
but	then	,	on	the	other	hand	,	you	have	the	american	cities	.
it	's	moving	by	 it 	 self 	 	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	 any 	 way 	 	,	the	american	cities	:	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 road 	 s 	 	 dispers 	 ed 	 	over	large	 area 	 s 	 	,	 al 	 most 	 	no	public	 transport 	 ation 	 	.
and	then	you	have	the	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	world	cities	,	with	a	 mix 	 ed 	 	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 vehicle 	 s 	 	,	 mix 	 ed 	 	land	-	use	 pattern 	 s 	 	,	 al 	 so 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	 dispers 	 ed 	 	but	often	with	a	 ver 	 y 	 	dense	urban	core	.
and	traffic	 plan 	 ner 	 s 	 	all	around	the	world	have	 tri 	 ed 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	different	 measure 	 s 	 	:	dense	cities	or	 dispers 	 ed 	 	cities	,	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 road 	 s 	 	or	 lot 	 s 	 	of	public	transport	or	 lot 	 s 	 	of	bike	 lane 	 s 	 	or	more	information	,	or	 lot 	 s 	 	of	different	 thing 	 s 	 	,	but	 noth 	 ing 	 	 seem 	 s 	 	to	work	.
but	all	of	these	 attempt 	 s 	 	have	one	thing	in	common	.
they	're	 bas 	 ically 	 	 attempt 	 s 	 	at	 figur 	 ing 	 	out	what	people	should	do	 in 	 stead 	 	of	rush	hour	car	 driv 	 ing 	 	.
they	're	 essential 	 ly 	 	,	to	a	point	,	 attempt 	 s 	 	at	 plan 	 ning 	 	what	other	people	should	do	,	 plan 	 ning 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	life	for	them	.
now	,	 plan 	 ning 	 	a	complex	social	system	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	thing	to	do	,	and	let	me	tell	you	a	story	.
back	in	1989	,	when	the	berlin	wall	fell	,	an	urban	 plan 	 ner 	 	in	london	got	a	phone	call	from	a	 col 	 league 	 	in	moscow	 say 	 ing 	 	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	``	hi	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	vladimir	.	i	'd	like	to	know	,	who	's	in	charge	of	london	's	bread	supply	?	``	and	the	urban	 plan 	 ner 	 	in	london	 go 	 es 	 	,	``	what	do	you	mean	,	who	's	in	charge	of	london	's	--
i	mean	,	no	one	is	in	charge	.	``
``	oh	,	but	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	 some 	 one 	 	must	be	in	charge	.
i	mean	,	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	system	.	 some 	 one 	 	must	control	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	.	``
``	no	.	no	.	no	one	is	in	charge	.
i	mean	,	it	 bas 	 ically 	 	--	i	have	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	thought	of	it	.
it	 bas 	 ically 	 	 organize 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	.	``
it	 organize 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	.
that	's	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	a	complex	social	system
which	 ha 	 s 	 	the	ability	of	self	-	 organ 	 izing 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	deep	 in 	 sight 	 	.
when	you	try	to	solve	 re 	 ally 	 	complex	social	 problem 	 s 	 	,	the	right	thing	to	do	is	most	of	the	time	to	create	the	 incentive 	 s 	 	.
you	do	n't	plan	the	 detail 	 s 	 	,	and	people	will	figure	out	what	to	do	,	how	to	adapt	to	 th 	 is 	 	new	 frame 	 work 	 	.
and	let	's	now	look	at	how	we	can	use	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 sight 	 	to	combat	road	 con 	 gest 	 ion 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	map	of	stockholm	,	my	 home 	 town 	 	.
now	,	stockholm	is	a	medium	-	sized	city	,	 rough 	 ly 	 	two	million	people	,	but	stockholm	 al 	 so 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	water	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	water	 mean 	 s 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 bridge 	 s 	 	--	narrow	 bridge 	 s 	 	,	old	 bridge 	 s 	 	--	which	 mean 	 s 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	road	 con 	 gest 	 ion 	 	.
and	these	red	 dot 	 s 	 	show	the	most	 con 	 gest 	 ed 	 	 part 	 s 	 	,	which	are	the	 bridge 	 s 	 	that	lead	 in 	 to 	 	the	inner	city	.
and	then	 some 	 one 	 	came	up	with	the	idea	that	,	 a 	 part 	 	from	good	public	transport	,	 a 	 part 	 	from	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	money	on	 road 	 s 	 	,	let	's	try	to	charge	 driver 	 s 	 	one	or	two	 eur 	 os 	 	at	these	 bottle 	 neck 	 s 	 	.
now	,	one	or	two	 eur 	 os 	 	,	that	is	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	a	lot	of	money	,	i	mean	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	 park 	 ing 	 	 charge 	 s 	 	and	running	 cost 	 s 	 	,	etc	.	,	so	you	would	 prob 	 ably 	 	expect	that	car	 driver 	 s 	 	would	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	react	to	 th 	 is 	 	 fair 	 ly 	 	small	charge	.
you	would	be	wrong	.
one	or	two	 eur 	 os 	 	was	 en 	 ough 	 	to	make	20	percent	of	 car 	 s 	 	disappear	from	rush	 hour 	 s 	 	.
now	,	20	percent	,	well	,	that	's	a	 fair 	 ly 	 	huge	figure	,	you	might	think	,	but	you	've	still	got	80	percent	left	of	the	problem	,	right	?
 be 	 cause 	 	you	still	have	80	percent	of	the	traffic	.
now	,	that	's	 al 	 so 	 	wrong	,	 be 	 cause 	 	traffic	 happen 	 s 	 	to	be	a	 non 	 linear 	 	 phenomen 	 on 	 	,	meaning	that	once	you	reach	above	a	certain	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	threshold	then	 con 	 gest 	 ion 	 	 start 	 s 	 	to	 in 	 crease 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	.
but	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	it	 al 	 so 	 	 work 	 s 	 	the	other	way	around	.
if	you	can	 reduc 	 e 	 	traffic	even	 some 	 what 	 	,	then	 con 	 gest 	 ion 	 	will	go	down	much	 fast 	 er 	 	than	you	might	think	.
now	,	 con 	 gest 	 ion 	 	 charge 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 introduc 	 ed 	 	in	stockholm	on	january	3	,	2006	,	and	the	first	picture	here	is	a	picture	of	stockholm	,	one	of	the	typical	 street 	 s 	 	,	january	2	.
the	first	day	with	the	 con 	 gest 	 ion 	 	 charge 	 s 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	you	take	away	20	percent	of	the	 car 	 s 	 	from	the	 street 	 s 	 	.
you	 re 	 ally 	 	 reduc 	 e 	 	 con 	 gest 	 ion 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 sub 	 stantial 	 ly 	 	.
but	,	well	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	i	mean	,	car	 driver 	 s 	 	adapt	,	right	?
so	after	a	while	they	would	all	come	back	 be 	 cause 	 	they	have	sort	of	gotten	used	to	 charge 	 s 	 	.
wrong	 aga 	 in 	 	.	it	's	now	six	and	a	half	 year 	 s 	 	ago	since	the	 con 	 gest 	 ion 	 	 charge 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 introduc 	 ed 	 	in	stockholm	,	and	we	 bas 	 ically 	 	have	the	same	low	traffic	 level 	 s 	 	still	.
but	you	see	,	there	's	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	gap	here	in	the	time	 s 	 eries 	 	in	2007	.
well	,	the	thing	is	that	,	the	 con 	 gest 	 ion 	 	 charge 	 s 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 introduc 	 ed 	 	first	 a 	 s 	 	a	trial	,	so	they	 we 	 re 	 	 introduc 	 ed 	 	in	january	and	then	 abolish 	 ed 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	at	the	end	of	july	,	 follow 	 ed 	 	by	a	 refer 	 end 	 um 	 	,	and	then	they	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 introduc 	 ed 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	in	2007	,	which	of	course	was	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	scientific	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
i	mean	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 f 	 un 	 	experiment	to	start	with	,	and	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	got	to	do	it	twice	.
and	 personal 	 ly 	 	,	i	would	like	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	every	once	a	year	or	so	,	but	they	wo	n't	let	me	do	that	.
but	it	was	 f 	 un 	 	 any 	 way 	 	.
so	,	we	 follow 	 ed 	 	up	.	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	last	day	with	the	 con 	 gest 	 ion 	 	 charge 	 s 	 	,	july	31	,	and	you	see	the	same	street	but	now	it	's	summer	,	and	summer	in	stockholm	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	nice	and	light	time	of	the	year	,	and	the	first	day	 with 	 out 	 	the	 con 	 gest 	 ion 	 	 charge 	 s 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
all	the	 car 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	back	 aga 	 in 	 	,	and	you	even	have	to	admire	the	car	 driver 	 s 	 	.	they	adapt	so	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
the	first	day	they	all	came	back	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	effect	 hang 	 ed 	 	on	.	so	2007	 figure 	 s 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
now	these	traffic	 figure 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	and	a	little	bit	surprising	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	to	know	,	but	i	would	say	that	the	most	surprising	slide	here	i	'm	going	to	show	you	 to 	 day 	 	is	not	 th 	 is 	 	one	.	it	's	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
 th 	 is 	 	 show 	 s 	 	public	support	for	 con 	 gest 	 ion 	 	 pric 	 ing 	 	of	stockholm	,	and	you	see	that	when	 con 	 gest 	 ion 	 	 pric 	 ing 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 introduc 	 ed 	 	in	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	spring	2006	,	people	 we 	 re 	 	 fierce 	 ly 	 	against	it	.
seventy	percent	of	the	population	did	n't	want	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	when	the	 con 	 gest 	 ion 	 	 charge 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	there	is	not	what	you	would	expect	,	that	people	 hat 	 ed 	 	it	more	and	more	.
no	,	on	the	 contr 	 ary 	 	,	they	 change 	 d 	 	,	up	to	a	point	where	we	now	have	70	percent	support	for	 keep 	 ing 	 	the	 charge 	 s 	 	,	meaning	that	--	i	mean	,	let	me	repeat	that	:	70	percent	of	the	population	in	stockholm	want	to	keep	a	price	for	 some 	 thing 	 	that	used	to	be	free	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	so	why	can	that	be	?	why	is	that	?
well	,	think	about	it	 th 	 is 	 	way	.	who	 change 	 d 	 	?
i	mean	,	the	20	percent	of	the	car	 driver 	 s 	 	that	 disappear 	 ed 	 	,	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	they	must	be	 dis 	 content 	 	in	a	way	.
and	where	did	they	go	?	if	we	can	understand	 th 	 is 	 	,	then	 may 	 be 	 	we	can	figure	out	how	people	can	be	so	happy	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
well	,	so	we	did	 th 	 is 	 	huge	interview	survey	with	 lot 	 s 	 	of	travel	 service 	 s 	 	,	and	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	figure	out	who	 change 	 d 	 	,	and	where	did	they	go	?
and	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	that	they	do	n't	know	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
for	some	reason	,	the	car	 driver 	 s 	 	are	--	they	are	confident	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	drive	the	same	way	that	they	used	to	do	.
and	why	is	that	?	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	that	travel	 pattern 	 s 	 	are	much	less	 s 	 table 	 	than	you	might	think	.
each	day	,	people	make	new	 decision 	 s 	 	,	and	people	change	and	the	world	 change 	 s 	 	around	them	,	and	each	day	all	of	these	 decision 	 s 	 	are	sort	of	 nudge 	 d 	 	ever	so	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	away	from	rush	hour	car	 driv 	 ing 	 	in	a	way	that	people	do	n't	even	notice	.
they	're	not	even	aware	of	 th 	 is 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
and	the	other	question	,	who	 change 	 d 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	mind	?
who	 change 	 d 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	opinion	,	and	why	?
so	we	did	 an 	 other 	 	interview	survey	,	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	figure	out	why	people	 change 	 d 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	mind	,	and	what	type	of	group	 change 	 d 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 mind 	 s 	 	?
and	after	 analyz 	 ing 	 	the	 answer 	 s 	 	,	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	that	more	than	half	of	them	 believ 	 e 	 	that	they	have	n't	 change 	 d 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 mind 	 s 	 	.
they	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	confident	that	they	have	 like 	 d 	 	 con 	 gest 	 ion 	 	 pric 	 ing 	 	all	 a 	 long 	 	.
which	 mean 	 s 	 	that	we	are	now	in	a	position	where	we	have	 reduc 	 ed 	 	traffic	 a 	 cross 	 	 th 	 is 	 	toll	 cord 	 on 	 	with	20	percent	,	and	 reduc 	 ed 	 	 con 	 gest 	 ion 	 	by	enormous	 number 	 s 	 	,	and	people	are	n't	even	aware	that	they	have	 change 	 d 	 	,	and	they	 honest 	 ly 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	they	have	 like 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	all	 a 	 long 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	power	of	 nudge 	 s 	 	when	 try 	 ing 	 	to	solve	complex	social	 problem 	 s 	 	,	and	when	you	do	that	,	you	should	n't	try	to	tell	people	how	to	adapt	.
you	should	just	nudge	them	in	the	right	direction	.
and	if	you	do	it	right	,	people	will	 actual 	 ly 	 	embrace	the	change	,	and	if	you	do	it	right	,	people	will	 actual 	 ly 	 	even	like	it	.
thank	you	.
