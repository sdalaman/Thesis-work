 th 	 is 	 	is	poo	,	and	what	i	want	to	do	 to 	 day 	 	is	share	my	 pass 	 ion 	 	for	poo	with	you	,	which	might	be	 quit 	 e 	 	difficult	,	but	i	think	what	you	might	find	more	 fasci 	 nating 	 	is	the	way	these	small	 animal 	 s 	 	deal	with	poo	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	animal	here	 ha 	 s 	 	got	a	brain	about	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	grain	of	rice	,	and	yet	it	can	do	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	and	i	could	n't	possibly	entertain	the	idea	of	 do 	 ing 	 	.
and	 bas 	 ically 	 	it	's	all	 evolv 	 ed 	 	to	handle	 it 	 s 	 	food	source	,	which	is	dung	.
so	the	question	is	,	where	do	we	start	 th 	 is 	 	story	?
and	it	 seem 	 s 	 	appropriate	to	start	at	the	end	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	waste	product	that	 come 	 s 	 	out	of	other	 animal 	 s 	 	,	but	it	still	 contain 	 s 	 	 nutrient 	 s 	 	and	there	are	sufficient	 nutrient 	 s 	 	in	there	for	dung	 beetle 	 s 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	to	make	a	living	,	and	so	dung	 beetle 	 s 	 	eat	dung	,	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 larva 	 e 	 	are	 al 	 so 	 	dung	-	 feed 	 ers 	 	.
they	are	grown	 complete 	 ly 	 	in	a	ball	of	dung	.
 with 	 in 	 	south	africa	,	we	've	got	about	800	species	of	dung	 beetle 	 s 	 	,	in	africa	we	've	got	2,000	species	of	dung	 beetle 	 s 	 	,	and	in	the	world	we	have	about	6,000	species	of	dung	 beetle 	 s 	 	.
so	,	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	dung	 beetle 	 s 	 	,	dung	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	.
 un 	 less 	 	you	're	prepared	to	get	dung	under	your	 finger 	 nail 	 s 	 	and	root	through	the	dung	 it 	 self 	 	,	you	'll	never	see	90	percent	of	the	dung	beetle	species	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	go	 direct 	 ly 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	dung	,	straight	down	 be 	 low 	 	it	,	and	then	they	shuttle	back	and	forth	between	the	dung	at	the	 s 	 oil 	 	surface	and	a	nest	they	make	 under 	 ground 	 	.
so	the	question	is	,	how	do	they	deal	with	 th 	 is 	 	material	?
and	most	dung	 beetle 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	wrap	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	package	of	some	sort	.
ten	percent	of	the	species	 actual 	 ly 	 	make	a	ball	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	ball	they	roll	away	from	the	dung	source	,	 usual 	 ly 	 	bury	it	at	a	remote	place	away	from	the	dung	source	,	and	they	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	behavior	by	which	they	are	able	to	roll	 the 	 ir 	 	 ball 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	proud	owner	of	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	dung	ball	.
you	can	see	it	's	a	male	 be 	 cause 	 	he	's	got	a	little	hair	on	the	back	of	his	 leg 	 s 	 	there	,	and	he	's	 clear 	 ly 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 pleas 	 ed 	 	about	what	he	's	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	on	there	.
and	then	he	's	about	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	victim	of	a	 vic 	 ious 	 	 s 	 mash 	 	-	and	-	grab	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	clear	 indic 	 ation 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 valu 	 able 	 	resource	.
and	so	 valu 	 able 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	have	to	be	 look 	 ed 	 	after	and	 guard 	 ed 	 	in	a	 part 	 icular 	 	way	,	and	we	think	the	reason	they	roll	the	 ball 	 s 	 	away	is	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 com 	 petition 	 	that	is	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 get 	 ting 	 	hold	of	that	dung	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	dung	pat	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	well	,	it	was	a	dung	pat	15	 minute 	 s 	 	before	 th 	 is 	 	photograph	was	taken	,	and	we	think	it	's	the	 intens 	 e 	 	 com 	 petition 	 	that	 make 	 s 	 	the	 beetle 	 s 	 	so	well	-	 adapt 	 ed 	 	to	 roll 	 ing 	 	 ball 	 s 	 	of	dung	.
so	what	you	've	got	to	imagine	here	is	 th 	 is 	 	animal	here	moving	 a 	 cross 	 	the	african	veld	.
 it 	 s 	 	head	is	down	.	it	's	 walk 	 ing 	 	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	.
it	's	the	most	bizarre	way	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	transport	your	food	in	any	 part 	 icular 	 	direction	,	and	at	the	same	time	it	's	got	to	deal	with	the	heat	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	africa	.	it	's	hot	.
so	what	i	want	to	share	with	you	now	are	some	of	the	 experiment 	 s 	 	that	 my 	 self 	 	and	my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	have	used	to	investigate	how	dung	 beetle 	 s 	 	deal	with	these	 problem 	 s 	 	.
so	watch	 th 	 is 	 	beetle	,	and	there	's	two	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	would	like	you	to	be	aware	of	.
the	first	is	how	it	 deal 	 s 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	obstacle	that	we	've	put	in	 it 	 s 	 	way	.	see	,	look	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	a	little	dance	,	and	then	it	 car 	 ries 	 	on	in	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	direction	that	it	took	in	the	first	place	.
a	little	dance	,	and	then	 head 	 s 	 	off	in	a	 part 	 icular 	 	direction	.
so	 clear 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	animal	 know 	 s 	 	where	it	's	going	and	it	 know 	 s 	 	where	it	 want 	 s 	 	to	go	,	and	that	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	think	about	it	,	you	're	at	the	dung	pile	,	you	've	got	 th 	 is 	 	great	big	pie	that	you	want	to	get	away	from	 every 	 body 	 	else	,	and	the	 quick 	 est 	 	way	to	do	it	is	in	a	straight	line	.
so	we	 g 	 ave 	 	them	some	more	 task 	 s 	 	to	deal	with	,	and	what	we	did	here	is	we	 turn 	 ed 	 	the	world	under	 the 	 ir 	 	feet	.	and	watch	 it 	 s 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	animal	 ha 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	the	whole	world	 turn 	 ed 	 	under	 it 	 s 	 	feet	.	it	's	 turn 	 ed 	 	by	90	 degree 	 s 	 	.
but	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	flinch	.	it	 know 	 s 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	where	it	 want 	 s 	 	to	go	,	and	it	 head 	 s 	 	off	in	that	 part 	 icular 	 	direction	.
so	our	next	question	then	was	,	how	are	they	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	?
what	are	they	 do 	 ing 	 	?	and	there	was	a	cue	that	was	 avail 	 able 	 	to	us	.
it	was	that	every	now	and	then	they	'd	climb	on	top	of	the	ball	and	they	'd	take	a	look	at	the	world	around	them	.
and	what	do	you	think	they	could	be	looking	at	 a 	 s 	 	they	climb	on	top	of	the	ball	?
what	are	the	obvious	 cue 	 s 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	animal	could	use	to	direct	 it 	 s 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	?	and	the	most	obvious	one	is	to	look	at	the	sky	,	and	so	we	thought	,	now	what	could	they	be	looking	at	in	the	sky	?
and	the	obvious	thing	to	look	at	is	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
so	a	classic	experiment	here	,	in	that	what	we	did	was	we	 move 	 d 	 	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
what	we	're	going	to	do	now	is	 sha 	 de 	 	the	 s 	 un 	 	with	a	board	and	then	move	the	 s 	 un 	 	with	a	mirror	to	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	position	.
and	look	at	what	the	beetle	 do 	 es 	 	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	a	little	double	dance	,	and	then	it	 head 	 s 	 	back	in	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	direction	it	went	in	the	first	place	.
what	 happen 	 s 	 	now	?	so	 clear 	 ly 	 	they	're	looking	at	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
the	 s 	 un 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	cue	in	the	sky	for	them	.
the	thing	is	the	 s 	 un 	 	is	not	 al 	 ways 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	to	you	,	 be 	 cause 	 	at	 s 	 un 	 set 	 	it	 disappear 	 s 	 	 be 	 low 	 	the	horizon	.
what	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	the	sky	here	is	that	there	's	a	great	big	pattern	of	 polar 	 ized 	 	light	in	the	sky	that	you	and	i	ca	n't	see	.	it	's	the	way	our	 eye 	 s 	 	are	built	.
but	the	 s 	 un 	 	is	at	the	horizon	over	here	and	we	know	that	when	the	 s 	 un 	 	is	at	the	horizon	,	say	it	's	over	on	 th 	 is 	 	side	,	there	is	a	north	-	south	,	a	huge	 path 	 way 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	sky	of	 polar 	 ized 	 	light	that	we	ca	n't	see	that	the	 beetle 	 s 	 	can	see	.
so	how	do	we	test	that	?	well	,	that	's	easy	.
what	we	do	is	we	get	a	great	big	 polar 	 ization 	 	filter	,	pop	the	beetle	 under 	 neath 	 	it	,	and	the	filter	is	at	right	 angle 	 s 	 	to	the	 polar 	 ization 	 	pattern	of	the	sky	.
the	beetle	 come 	 s 	 	out	from	 under 	 neath 	 	the	filter	and	it	 do 	 es 	 	a	right	-	hand	turn	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 come 	 s 	 	back	under	the	sky	that	it	was	 original 	 ly 	 	orientated	to	and	then	reorientates	 it 	 self 	 	back	to	the	direction	it	was	 original 	 ly 	 	going	in	.
so	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 beetle 	 s 	 	can	see	 polar 	 ized 	 	light	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	what	we	've	got	so	far	is	,	what	are	 beetle 	 s 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	?	they	're	 roll 	 ing 	 	 ball 	 s 	 	.
how	are	they	 do 	 ing 	 	it	?	well	,	they	're	 roll 	 ing 	 	them	in	a	straight	line	.
how	are	they	 maintain 	 ing 	 	it	in	a	 part 	 icular 	 	straight	line	?
well	,	they	're	looking	at	 ce 	 les 	 tial 	 	 cue 	 s 	 	in	the	sky	,	some	of	which	you	and	i	ca	n't	see	.
but	how	do	they	pick	up	 t 	 hose 	 	 ce 	 les 	 tial 	 	 cue 	 s 	 	?
that	was	what	was	of	interest	to	us	next	.
and	it	was	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	little	behavior	,	the	dance	,	that	we	thought	was	 import 	 ant 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	look	,	it	 take 	 s 	 	a	pause	every	now	and	then	,	and	then	 head 	 s 	 	off	in	the	direction	that	it	 want 	 s 	 	to	go	in	.
so	what	are	they	 do 	 ing 	 	when	they	do	 th 	 is 	 	dance	?
how	far	can	we	push	them	before	they	will	reorientate	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	?
and	in	 th 	 is 	 	experiment	here	,	what	we	did	was	we	 force 	 d 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	a	channel	,	and	you	can	see	he	was	n't	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 force 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	channel	,	and	we	 gradu 	 ally 	 	 dis 	 place 	 d 	 	the	beetle	by	180	 degree 	 s 	 	 un 	 til 	 	 th 	 is 	 	individual	 end 	 s 	 	up	going	in	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	direction	that	it	 want 	 ed 	 	to	go	in	,	in	the	first	place	.
and	let	's	see	what	his	 re 	 action 	 	is	 a 	 s 	 	he	's	headed	through	90	 degree 	 s 	 	here	,	and	now	he	's	going	to	--	when	he	 end 	 s 	 	up	down	here	,	he	's	going	to	be	180	 degree 	 s 	 	in	the	wrong	direction	.
and	see	what	his	 respons 	 e 	 	is	.
he	 do 	 es 	 	a	little	dance	,	he	 turn 	 s 	 	around	,	and	 head 	 s 	 	back	in	 th 	 is 	 	.	he	 know 	 s 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	where	he	's	going	.
he	 know 	 s 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	the	problem	is	,	and	he	 know 	 s 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	how	to	deal	with	it	,	and	the	dance	is	 th 	 is 	 	 transit 	 ion 	 	behavior	that	 allow 	 s 	 	them	to	reorientate	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
so	that	's	the	dance	,	but	after	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	the	african	bush	 watch 	 ing 	 	dung	 beetle 	 s 	 	on	nice	hot	 day 	 s 	 	,	we	 notice 	 d 	 	that	there	was	 an 	 other 	 	behavior	 associate 	 d 	 	with	the	dance	behavior	.
every	now	and	then	,	when	they	climb	on	top	of	the	ball	,	they	wipe	 the 	 ir 	 	face	.
and	you	see	him	do	it	 aga 	 in 	 	.
now	we	thought	,	now	what	could	be	going	on	here	?
 clear 	 ly 	 	the	ground	is	 ver 	 y 	 	hot	,	and	when	the	ground	is	hot	,	they	dance	more	often	,	and	when	they	do	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	dance	,	they	wipe	the	bottom	of	 the 	 ir 	 	face	.
and	we	thought	that	it	could	be	a	thermoregulatory	behavior	.
we	thought	that	 may 	 be 	 	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	is	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	off	the	hot	 s 	 oil 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	 s 	 pit 	 ting 	 	onto	 the 	 ir 	 	face	to	cool	 the 	 ir 	 	head	down	.
so	what	we	did	was	design	a	couple	of	 arena 	 s 	 	.
one	was	hot	,	one	was	cold	.
we	 s 	 had 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	one	.	we	left	that	one	hot	.
and	then	what	we	did	was	we	 film 	 ed 	 	them	with	a	thermal	camera	.
so	what	you	're	looking	at	here	is	a	heat	image	of	the	system	,	and	what	you	can	see	here	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	from	the	poo	is	a	cool	dung	ball	.
so	the	truth	is	,	if	you	look	at	the	temperature	over	here	,	dung	is	cool	.
so	all	we	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	here	is	 compar 	 ing 	 	the	temperature	of	the	beetle	against	the	 back 	 ground 	 	.
so	the	 back 	 ground 	 	here	is	around	about	50	 degree 	 s 	 	 cent 	 i 	 grade 	 	.
the	beetle	 it 	 self 	 	and	the	ball	are	 prob 	 ably 	 	around	about	30	to	35	 degree 	 s 	 	 cent 	 i 	 grade 	 	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	great	big	ball	of	ice	cream	that	 th 	 is 	 	beetle	is	now	 transport 	 ing 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	hot	veld	.
it	is	n't	 climb 	 ing 	 	.	it	is	n't	 danc 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 it 	 s 	 	body	temperature	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 relat 	 ively 	 	low	.
it	's	about	the	same	 a 	 s 	 	 your 	 s 	 	and	mine	.
and	what	's	of	interest	here	is	that	little	brain	is	 quit 	 e 	 	cool	.
but	if	we	contrast	now	what	 happen 	 s 	 	in	a	hot	environment	,	look	at	the	temperature	of	the	 s 	 oil 	 	.
it	's	up	around	55	to	60	 degree 	 s 	 	 cent 	 i 	 grade 	 	.
watch	how	often	the	beetle	 dance 	 s 	 	.
and	look	at	 it 	 s 	 	front	 leg 	 s 	 	.	they	're	roaringly	hot	.
so	the	ball	 leav 	 es 	 	a	little	thermal	shadow	,	and	the	beetle	 climb 	 s 	 	on	top	of	the	ball	and	 wipe 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	face	,	and	all	the	time	it	's	 try 	 ing 	 	to	cool	 it 	 self 	 	down	,	we	think	,	and	avoid	the	hot	sand	that	it	's	 walk 	 ing 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	.
and	what	we	did	then	was	put	little	 boot 	 s 	 	on	these	 leg 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	way	to	test	if	the	 leg 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 sens 	 ing 	 	the	temperature	of	the	 s 	 oil 	 	.
and	if	you	look	over	here	,	with	 boot 	 s 	 	they	climb	onto	the	ball	far	less	often	when	they	had	no	 boot 	 s 	 	on	.
so	we	 de 	 scribed 	 	these	 a 	 s 	 	cool	 boot 	 s 	 	.
it	was	a	 dent 	 al 	 	 com 	 pound 	 	that	we	used	to	make	these	 boot 	 s 	 	.
and	we	 al 	 so 	 	 cool 	 ed 	 	down	the	dung	ball	,	so	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	put	the	ball	in	the	 f 	 ridge 	 	,	 g 	 ave 	 	them	a	nice	cool	dung	ball	,	and	they	 climb 	 ed 	 	onto	that	ball	far	less	often	than	when	they	had	a	hot	ball	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	stilting	.	it	's	a	thermal	behavior	that	you	and	i	do	if	we	cross	the	beach	,	we	jump	onto	a	 to 	 wel 	 	,	 some 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 to 	 wel 	 	--	``	sorry	,	i	've	 jump 	 ed 	 	onto	your	 to 	 wel 	 	.	``	--	and	then	you	scuttle	 a 	 cross 	 	onto	 some 	 body 	 	else	's	 to 	 wel 	 	,	and	that	way	you	do	n't	burn	your	feet	.
and	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	the	 beetle 	 s 	 	are	 do 	 ing 	 	here	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	there	's	one	more	story	i	'd	like	to	share	with	you	,	and	that	's	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	species	.
it	's	from	a	 gen 	 us 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	pachysoma	.
there	are	13	species	in	the	 gen 	 us 	 	,	and	they	have	a	 part 	 icular 	 	behavior	that	i	think	you	will	find	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	dung	beetle	.	watch	what	he	's	 do 	 ing 	 	.
can	you	spot	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	?
they	do	n't	 normal 	 ly 	 	go	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	.	it	's	in	 s 	 low 	 	motion	.
but	it	's	 walk 	 ing 	 	 forward 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	taking	a	pellet	of	dry	dung	with	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	different	species	in	the	same	 gen 	 us 	 	but	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	 for 	 aging 	 	behavior	.
there	's	one	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	 a 	 spect 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	dung	beetle	's	behavior	that	we	found	 quit 	 e 	 	 fasci 	 nating 	 	,	and	that	's	that	it	 for 	 age 	 s 	 	and	 pro 	 vision 	 s 	 	a	nest	.
so	watch	 th 	 is 	 	individual	here	,	and	what	he	's	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	is	set	up	a	nest	.
and	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	like	 th 	 is 	 	first	position	,	but	he	 come 	 s 	 	up	with	a	second	position	,	and	about	50	 minute 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	that	nest	is	 finish 	 ed 	 	,	and	he	 head 	 s 	 	off	to	 for 	 age 	 	and	 pro 	 vision 	 	at	a	pile	of	dry	dung	 pel 	 lets 	 	.
and	what	i	want	you	to	notice	is	the	 out 	 ward 	 	path	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	the	homeward	path	,	and	 compar 	 e 	 	the	two	.
and	by	and	large	,	you	'll	see	that	the	homeward	path	is	far	more	direct	than	the	 out 	 ward 	 	path	.
on	the	 out 	 ward 	 	path	,	he	's	 al 	 ways 	 	on	the	 look 	 out 	 	for	a	new	blob	of	dung	.
on	the	way	home	,	he	 know 	 s 	 	where	home	is	,	and	he	 want 	 s 	 	to	go	straight	to	it	.
the	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	here	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	one	-	way	trip	,	 a 	 s 	 	in	most	dung	 beetle 	 s 	 	.	the	trip	here	is	 repeat 	 ed 	 	back	and	forth	between	a	 pro 	 vision 	 ing 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	and	a	nest	 s 	 ite 	 	.
and	watch	,	you	're	going	to	see	 an 	 other 	 	south	african	crime	taking	place	right	now	.
and	his	neighbor	 steal 	 s 	 	one	of	his	dung	 pel 	 lets 	 	.
so	what	we	're	looking	at	here	is	a	behavior	 call 	 ed 	 	path	 integ 	 ration 	 	.
and	what	's	taking	place	is	that	the	beetle	 ha 	 s 	 	got	a	home	spot	,	it	 go 	 es 	 	out	on	a	 con 	 volu 	 ted 	 	path	looking	for	food	,	and	then	when	it	 find 	 s 	 	food	,	it	 head 	 s 	 	straight	home	.	it	 know 	 s 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	where	 it 	 s 	 	home	is	.
now	there	's	two	ways	it	could	be	 do 	 ing 	 	that	,	and	we	can	test	that	by	 dis 	 placing 	 	the	beetle	to	a	new	position	when	it	's	at	the	 for 	 aging 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
if	it	's	using	landmarks	,	it	will	find	 it 	 s 	 	home	.	if	it	is	using	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	path	 integ 	 ration 	 	,	it	will	not	find	 it 	 s 	 	home	.	it	will	 arriv 	 e 	 	at	the	wrong	spot	,	and	what	it	's	 do 	 ing 	 	here	if	it	's	using	path	 integ 	 ration 	 	is	it	's	 count 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 step 	 s 	 	or	 measur 	 ing 	 	the	distance	out	in	 th 	 is 	 	direction	.
it	 know 	 s 	 	the	 bear 	 ing 	 	home	,	and	it	 know 	 s 	 	it	should	be	in	that	direction	.
if	you	 dis 	 place 	 	it	,	it	 end 	 s 	 	up	in	the	wrong	place	.
so	let	's	see	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	we	put	 th 	 is 	 	beetle	to	the	test	with	a	similar	experiment	.
so	here	's	our	 cunn 	 ing 	 	 experiment 	 er 	 	.
he	displaces	the	beetle	,	and	now	we	have	to	see	what	is	going	to	take	place	.
what	we	've	got	is	a	burrow	.	that	's	where	the	 for 	 age 	 	was	.
the	 for 	 age 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 dis 	 place 	 d 	 	to	a	new	position	.
if	he	's	using	 land 	 mark 	 	 orient 	 ation 	 	,	he	should	be	able	to	find	the	burrow	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	'll	be	able	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	the	landmarks	around	it	.
if	he	's	using	path	 integ 	 ration 	 	,	then	it	should	end	up	in	the	wrong	spot	over	here	.
so	let	's	watch	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	we	put	the	beetle	through	the	whole	test	.
so	there	he	is	there	.
he	's	about	to	head	home	,	and	look	what	 happen 	 s 	 	.
shame	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	a	clue	.
it	 start 	 s 	 	to	search	for	 it 	 s 	 	house	in	the	right	distance	away	from	the	food	,	but	it	is	 clear 	 ly 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	lost	.
so	we	know	now	that	 th 	 is 	 	animal	uses	path	 integ 	 ration 	 	to	find	 it 	 s 	 	way	around	,	and	the	callous	 experiment 	 er 	 	 lead 	 s 	 	it	top	left	and	 leav 	 es 	 	it	.
so	what	we	're	looking	at	here	are	a	group	of	 animal 	 s 	 	that	use	a	compass	,	and	they	use	the	 s 	 un 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	compass	to	find	 the 	 ir 	 	way	around	,	and	they	have	some	sort	of	system	for	 measur 	 ing 	 	that	distance	,	and	we	know	that	these	species	here	 actual 	 ly 	 	count	the	 step 	 s 	 	.	that	's	what	they	use	 a 	 s 	 	an	odometer	,	a	step	-	 count 	 ing 	 	system	,	to	find	 the 	 ir 	 	way	back	home	.
we	do	n't	know	yet	what	dung	 beetle 	 s 	 	use	.
so	what	have	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	these	 animal 	 s 	 	with	a	brain	that	's	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	grain	of	rice	?
well	,	we	know	that	they	can	roll	 ball 	 s 	 	in	a	straight	line	using	 ce 	 les 	 tial 	 	 cue 	 s 	 	.
we	know	that	the	dance	behavior	is	an	 orient 	 ation 	 	behavior	and	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	 thermo 	 regulat 	 ion 	 	behavior	,	and	we	 al 	 so 	 	know	that	they	use	a	path	 integ 	 ration 	 	system	for	 find 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	way	home	.
so	for	a	small	animal	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	a	 fair 	 ly 	 	 revolt 	 ing 	 	 sub 	 stance 	 	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	learn	an	awful	lot	from	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 behavior 	 s 	 	that	you	and	i	could	n't	possibly	do	.
thank	you	.
