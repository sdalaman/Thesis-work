in	oxford	in	the	1950s	,	there	was	a	fantastic	doctor	,	who	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 usual 	 	,	named	alice	stewart	.
and	alice	was	 un 	 usual 	 	 part 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	,	of	course	,	she	was	a	woman	,	which	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	rare	in	the	1950s	.
and	she	was	 brilli 	 ant 	 	,	she	was	one	of	the	,	at	the	time	,	the	 young 	 est 	 	fellow	to	be	 elect 	 ed 	 	to	the	royal	college	of	 physician 	 s 	 	.
she	was	 un 	 usual 	 	too	 be 	 cause 	 	she	 continu 	 ed 	 	to	work	after	she	got	married	,	after	she	had	 kid 	 s 	 	,	and	even	after	she	got	 divorce 	 d 	 	and	was	a	single	parent	,	she	 continu 	 ed 	 	her	medical	work	.
and	she	was	 un 	 usual 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	she	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	a	new	science	,	the	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	field	of	 epidemio 	 logy 	 	,	the	 stud 	 y 	 	of	 pattern 	 s 	 	in	disease	.
but	like	every	scientist	,	she	 appreciate 	 d 	 	that	to	make	her	mark	,	what	she	 need 	 ed 	 	to	do	was	find	a	hard	problem	and	solve	it	.
the	hard	problem	that	alice	chose	was	the	 ris 	 ing 	 	incidence	of	 child 	 hood 	 	 cancer 	 s 	 	.
most	disease	is	 correlate 	 d 	 	with	poverty	,	but	in	the	case	of	 child 	 hood 	 	 cancer 	 s 	 	,	the	children	who	 we 	 re 	 	 dy 	 ing 	 	 seem 	 ed 	 	 most 	 ly 	 	to	come	from	 af 	 fluent 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	.
so	,	what	,	she	 want 	 ed 	 	to	know	,	could	explain	 th 	 is 	 	 anomal 	 y 	 	?
now	,	alice	had	trouble	 get 	 ting 	 	 fund 	 ing 	 	for	her	research	.
in	the	end	,	she	got	just	1,000	 pound 	 s 	 	from	the	 lad 	 y 	 	tata	memorial	prize	.
and	that	 me 	 ant 	 	she	 k 	 new 	 	she	 on 	 ly 	 	had	one	shot	at	 collect 	 ing 	 	her	data	.
now	,	she	had	no	idea	what	to	look	for	.
 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	was	a	needle	in	a	haystack	sort	of	search	,	so	she	 ask 	 ed 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	she	could	think	of	.
had	the	children	eaten	 boil 	 ed 	 	 sweet 	 s 	 	?
had	they	 consum 	 ed 	 	 color 	 ed 	 	 drink 	 s 	 	?
did	they	eat	fish	and	 chip 	 s 	 	?
did	they	have	 in 	 door 	 	or	 out 	 door 	 	 plumb 	 ing 	 	?
what	time	of	life	had	they	 start 	 ed 	 	school	?
and	when	her	carbon	 cop 	 ied 	 	 question 	 naire 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	to	come	back	,	one	thing	and	one	thing	 on 	 ly 	 	 jump 	 ed 	 	out	with	the	 statistic 	 al 	 	 clar 	 ity 	 	of	a	kind	that	most	 scientist 	 s 	 	can	 on 	 ly 	 	dream	of	.
the	children	who	had	 di 	 ed 	 	had	had	 mother 	 s 	 	who	had	 be 	 en 	 	x	-	rayed	when	 pregn 	 ant 	 	.
now	that	 find 	 ing 	 	flew	in	the	face	of	 convention 	 al 	 	 wis 	 dom 	 	.
 convention 	 al 	 	 wis 	 dom 	 	held	that	 every 	 thing 	 	was	safe	up	to	a	point	,	a	threshold	.
it	flew	in	the	face	of	 convention 	 al 	 	 wis 	 dom 	 	,	which	was	huge	 ent 	 husiasm 	 	for	the	cool	new	technology	of	that	age	,	which	was	the	x	-	ray	machine	.
and	it	flew	in	the	face	of	 doctor 	 s 	 	'	idea	of	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	which	was	 a 	 s 	 	people	who	 help 	 ed 	 	 patient 	 s 	 	,	they	did	n't	harm	them	.
 never 	 the 	 less 	 	,	alice	stewart	 rush 	 ed 	 	to	publish	her	 pre 	 liminary 	 	 find 	 ing 	 s 	 	in	the	 lance 	 t 	 	in	1956	.
people	got	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	,	there	was	talk	of	the	 no 	 bel 	 	prize	,	and	alice	 re 	 ally 	 	was	in	a	big	 hur 	 ry 	 	to	try	to	 stud 	 y 	 	all	the	 case 	 s 	 	of	 child 	 hood 	 	cancer	she	could	find	before	they	 disappear 	 ed 	 	.
in	fact	,	she	need	not	have	hurried	.
it	was	fully	25	 year 	 s 	 	before	the	british	and	medical	--	british	and	american	medical	establishments	 abandon 	 ed 	 	the	practice	of	x	-	raying	 pregn 	 ant 	 	women	.
the	data	was	out	there	,	it	was	open	,	it	was	 free 	 ly 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	,	but	 no 	 body 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	know	.
a	child	a	week	was	 dy 	 ing 	 	,	but	 noth 	 ing 	 	 change 	 d 	 	.
 open 	 ness 	 	 al 	 one 	 	ca	n't	drive	change	.
so	for	25	 year 	 s 	 	alice	stewart	had	a	 ver 	 y 	 	big	fight	on	her	 hand 	 s 	 	.
so	,	how	did	she	know	that	she	was	right	?
well	,	she	had	a	fantastic	model	for	 think 	 ing 	 	.
she	 work 	 ed 	 	with	a	 statistic 	 ian 	 	named	george	kneale	,	and	george	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 every 	 thing 	 	that	alice	was	n't	.
so	,	alice	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 out 	 going 	 	and	 soci 	 able 	 	,	and	george	was	a	 reclus 	 e 	 	.
alice	was	 ver 	 y 	 	warm	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 em 	 pathetic 	 	with	her	 patient 	 s 	 	.
george	 frank 	 ly 	 	 prefer 	 red 	 	 number 	 s 	 	to	people	.
but	he	 s 	 aid 	 	 th 	 is 	 	fantastic	thing	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	relationship	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	my	job	is	to	prove	dr.	stewart	wrong	.	``	he	 active 	 ly 	 	 s 	 ought 	 	disconfirmation	.
different	ways	of	looking	at	her	 model 	 s 	 	,	at	her	 statistic 	 s 	 	,	different	ways	of	crunching	the	data	in	order	to	 dis 	 prove 	 	her	.
he	saw	his	job	 a 	 s 	 	creating	conflict	around	her	 the 	 ories 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	 on 	 ly 	 	by	not	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	prove	that	she	was	wrong	,	that	george	could	give	alice	the	confidence	she	 need 	 ed 	 	to	know	that	she	was	right	.
it	's	a	fantastic	model	of	 collabor 	 ation 	 	--	 think 	 ing 	 	 partner 	 s 	 	who	are	n't	echo	 chamber 	 s 	 	.
i	wonder	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	us	have	,	or	 da 	 re 	 	to	have	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 collabor 	 ators 	 	.
alice	and	george	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	good	at	conflict	.
they	saw	it	 a 	 s 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	.
so	what	 do 	 es 	 	that	kind	of	 construct 	 ive 	 	conflict	 requir 	 e 	 	?
well	,	first	of	all	,	it	 requir 	 es 	 	that	we	find	people	who	are	 ver 	 y 	 	different	from	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	we	have	to	resist	the	 neuro 	 bio 	 logical 	 	drive	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	that	we	 re 	 ally 	 	prefer	people	 most 	 ly 	 	like	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	and	it	 mean 	 s 	 	we	have	to	seek	out	people	with	different	 back 	 ground 	 s 	 	,	different	 discipline 	 s 	 	,	different	ways	of	 think 	 ing 	 	and	different	experience	,	and	find	ways	to	engage	with	them	.
that	 requir 	 es 	 	a	lot	of	patience	and	a	lot	of	energy	.
and	the	more	i	've	thought	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	the	more	i	think	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	that	that	's	a	kind	of	love	.
 be 	 cause 	 	you	 simpl 	 y 	 	wo	n't	commit	that	kind	of	energy	and	time	if	you	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	care	.
and	it	 al 	 so 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	we	have	to	be	prepared	to	change	our	 mind 	 s 	 	.
alice	's	daughter	told	me	that	every	time	alice	went	head	-	to	-	head	with	a	fellow	scientist	,	they	made	her	think	and	think	and	think	 aga 	 in 	 	.
``	my	mother	,	``	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	my	mother	did	n't	enjoy	a	fight	,	but	she	was	 re 	 ally 	 	good	at	them	.	``
so	it	's	one	thing	to	do	that	in	a	one	-	to	-	one	relationship	.
but	it	 strike 	 s 	 	me	that	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	we	face	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 disaster 	 s 	 	that	we	've	 experience 	 d 	 	,	 most 	 ly 	 	have	n't	come	from	 individual 	 s 	 	,	they	've	come	from	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	,	some	of	them	 big 	 ger 	 	than	 count 	 ries 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	them	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 affect 	 ing 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	,	 thousand 	 s 	 	,	even	 million 	 s 	 	of	 live 	 s 	 	.
so	how	do	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	think	?
well	,	for	the	most	part	,	they	do	n't	.
and	that	is	n't	 be 	 cause 	 	they	do	n't	want	to	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	ca	n't	.
and	they	ca	n't	 be 	 cause 	 	the	people	 in 	 side 	 	of	them	are	too	 af 	 raid 	 	of	conflict	.
in	 survey 	 s 	 	of	european	and	american	 ex 	 ecutive 	 s 	 	,	fully	85	percent	of	them	 acknowledg 	 ed 	 	that	they	had	 issue 	 s 	 	or	 concern 	 s 	 	at	work	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	 af 	 raid 	 	to	raise	.
 af 	 raid 	 	of	the	conflict	that	that	would	 provok 	 e 	 	,	 af 	 raid 	 	to	get	 em 	 broil 	 ed 	 	in	 argument 	 s 	 	that	they	did	not	know	how	to	manage	,	and	felt	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	bound	to	lose	.
 eight 	 y 	 	-	five	percent	is	a	 re 	 ally 	 	big	number	.
it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	 most 	 ly 	 	ca	n't	do	what	george	and	alice	so	triumphantly	did	.
they	ca	n't	think	together	.
and	it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	people	like	 man 	 y 	 	of	us	,	who	have	run	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	,	and	gone	out	of	our	way	to	try	to	find	the	 ver 	 y 	 	best	people	we	can	,	 most 	 ly 	 	fail	to	get	the	best	out	of	them	.
so	how	do	we	develop	the	 skill 	 s 	 	that	we	need	?
 be 	 cause 	 	it	 do 	 es 	 	take	skill	and	practice	,	too	.
if	we	are	n't	going	to	be	 af 	 raid 	 	of	conflict	,	we	have	to	see	it	 a 	 s 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	,	and	then	we	have	to	get	 re 	 ally 	 	good	at	it	.
so	,	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	i	 work 	 ed 	 	with	an	 ex 	 ecutive 	 	named	joe	,	and	joe	 work 	 ed 	 	for	a	medical	 de 	 vice 	 	company	.
and	joe	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	the	 de 	 vice 	 	that	he	was	 work 	 ing 	 	on	.
he	thought	that	it	was	too	 complic 	 ated 	 	and	he	thought	that	 it 	 s 	 	 complex 	 ity 	 	 create 	 d 	 	 margin 	 s 	 	of	error	that	could	 re 	 ally 	 	hurt	people	.
he	was	 af 	 raid 	 	of	 do 	 ing 	 	damage	to	the	 patient 	 s 	 	he	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	help	.
but	when	he	 look 	 ed 	 	around	his	 organ 	 ization 	 	,	 no 	 body 	 	else	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	be	at	all	 worri 	 ed 	 	.
so	,	he	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	say	 any 	 thing 	 	.
after	all	,	 may 	 be 	 	they	 k 	 new 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	he	did	n't	.
 may 	 be 	 	he	'd	look	stupid	.
but	he	 ke 	 pt 	 	 worry 	 ing 	 	about	it	,	and	he	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	it	so	much	that	he	got	to	the	point	where	he	thought	the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	he	could	do	was	 leav 	 e 	 	a	job	he	 love 	 d 	 	.
in	the	end	,	joe	and	i	found	a	way	for	him	to	raise	his	 concern 	 s 	 	.
and	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	then	is	what	 al 	 most 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	 every 	 body 	 	had	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	 question 	 s 	 	and	 doubt 	 s 	 	.
so	now	joe	had	 al 	 lies 	 	.	they	could	think	together	.
and	 y 	 es 	 	,	there	was	a	lot	of	conflict	and	debate	and	argument	,	but	that	 allow 	 ed 	 	 every 	 one 	 	around	the	table	to	be	creative	,	to	solve	the	problem	,	and	to	change	the	 de 	 vice 	 	.
joe	was	what	a	lot	of	people	might	think	of	 a 	 s 	 	a	 whistl 	 e 	 	-	 blow 	 er 	 	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	that	like	 al 	 most 	 	all	 whistl 	 e 	 	-	 blow 	 ers 	 	,	he	was	n't	a	crank	at	all	,	he	was	 passionate 	 ly 	 	 devote 	 d 	 	to	the	 organ 	 ization 	 	and	the	 high 	 er 	 	 purpose 	 s 	 	that	that	 organ 	 ization 	 	 serv 	 ed 	 	.
but	he	had	 be 	 en 	 	so	 af 	 raid 	 	of	conflict	,	 un 	 til 	 	 final 	 ly 	 	he	 be 	 came 	 	more	 af 	 raid 	 	of	the	silence	.
and	when	he	 da 	 red 	 	to	speak	,	he	 discover 	 ed 	 	much	more	 in 	 side 	 	 him 	 self 	 	and	much	more	give	in	the	system	than	he	had	ever	 imagin 	 ed 	 	.
and	his	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	do	n't	think	of	him	 a 	 s 	 	a	crank	.
they	think	of	him	 a 	 s 	 	a	 lead 	 er 	 	.
so	,	how	do	we	have	these	 conversation 	 s 	 	more	 eas 	 ily 	 	and	more	often	?
well	,	the	university	of	delft	 requir 	 es 	 	that	 it 	 s 	 	phd	 student 	 s 	 	have	to	submit	five	 state 	 ments 	 	that	they	're	prepared	to	defend	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	matter	what	the	 state 	 ments 	 	are	about	,	what	 matter 	 s 	 	is	that	the	 candid 	 ates 	 	are	 will 	 ing 	 	and	able	to	stand	up	to	 author 	 ity 	 	.
i	think	it	's	a	fantastic	system	,	but	i	think	 leav 	 ing 	 	it	to	phd	 candid 	 ates 	 	is	far	too	few	people	,	and	way	too	late	in	life	.
i	think	we	need	to	be	 teach 	 ing 	 	these	 skill 	 s 	 	to	 kid 	 s 	 	and	 adult 	 s 	 	at	every	stage	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	,	if	we	want	to	have	 think 	 ing 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	and	a	 think 	 ing 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
the	fact	is	that	most	of	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 catastroph 	 es 	 	that	we	've	 witness 	 ed 	 	 rare 	 ly 	 	come	from	information	that	is	secret	or	 hid 	 den 	 	.
it	 come 	 s 	 	from	information	that	is	 free 	 ly 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	and	out	there	,	but	that	we	are	willfully	blind	to	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	ca	n't	handle	,	do	n't	want	to	handle	,	the	conflict	that	it	provokes	.
but	when	we	 da 	 re 	 	to	break	that	silence	,	or	when	we	 da 	 re 	 	to	see	,	and	we	create	conflict	,	we	 en 	 able 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	the	people	around	us	to	do	our	 ver 	 y 	 	best	 think 	 ing 	 	.
open	information	is	fantastic	,	open	 network 	 s 	 	are	essential	.
but	the	truth	wo	n't	set	us	free	 un 	 til 	 	we	develop	the	 skill 	 s 	 	and	the	habit	and	the	talent	and	the	moral	courage	to	use	it	.
 open 	 ness 	 	is	n't	the	end	.
it	's	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
