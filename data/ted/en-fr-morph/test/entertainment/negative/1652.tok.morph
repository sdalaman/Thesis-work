so	i	want	to	talk	to	you	about	two	 thing 	 s 	 	 to 	 night 	 	.
number	one	:	 teach 	 ing 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	and	 do 	 ing 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	.
and	second	,	that	language	is	one	of	the	most	 pro 	 found 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 separat 	 e 	 	us	all	over	the	world	.
and	in	my	little	corner	of	the	world	,	these	two	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	related	,	and	i	want	to	tell	you	how	 to 	 night 	 	.
now	,	 no 	 body 	 	 want 	 s 	 	an	operation	.
who	here	 ha 	 s 	 	had	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	?
did	you	want	it	?
keep	your	 hand 	 s 	 	up	if	you	 want 	 ed 	 	an	operation	.
 no 	 body 	 	 want 	 s 	 	an	operation	.
in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	 no 	 body 	 	 want 	 s 	 	an	operation	with	 tool 	 s 	 	like	these	through	large	 incision 	 s 	 	that	cause	a	lot	of	pain	,	that	cause	a	lot	of	time	out	of	work	or	out	of	school	,	that	 leav 	 e 	 	a	big	scar	.
but	if	you	have	to	have	an	operation	,	what	you	 re 	 ally 	 	want	is	a	 minimal 	 ly 	 	invasive	operation	.
that	's	what	i	want	to	talk	to	you	about	 to 	 night 	 	--	how	 do 	 ing 	 	and	 teach 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	type	of	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	led	us	on	a	search	for	a	better	universal	 transl 	 ator 	 	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	type	of	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	is	hard	,	and	it	 start 	 s 	 	by	 put 	 ting 	 	people	to	sleep	,	 put 	 ting 	 	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	abdomen	,	 blow 	 ing 	 	them	up	like	a	balloon	,	 stick 	 ing 	 	one	of	these	sharp	 point 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	abdomen	--	it	's	 danger 	 ous 	 	stuff	--	and	taking	 instrument 	 s 	 	and	 watch 	 ing 	 	it	on	a	tv	screen	.
so	let	's	see	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 gall 	 bladder 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	.
we	perform	a	million	of	these	a	year	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 al 	 one 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	real	thing	.	there	's	no	blood	.
and	you	can	see	how	focused	the	 surgeon 	 s 	 	are	,	how	much	 concent 	 ration 	 	it	 take 	 s 	 	.
you	can	see	it	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 face 	 s 	 	.
it	's	hard	to	teach	,	and	it	's	not	all	that	easy	to	learn	.
we	do	about	five	million	of	these	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	and	 may 	 be 	 	20	million	of	these	 world 	 wide 	 	.
all	right	,	you	've	all	heard	the	term	:	``	he	's	a	born	surgeon	.	``	let	me	tell	you	,	 surgeon 	 s 	 	are	not	born	.
 surgeon 	 s 	 	are	not	made	either	.	there	are	no	little	 tank 	 s 	 	where	we	're	making	 surgeon 	 s 	 	.
 surgeon 	 s 	 	are	trained	one	step	at	a	time	.
it	 start 	 s 	 	with	a	 found 	 ation 	 	,	 bas 	 ic 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	.
we	build	on	that	and	we	take	people	,	 hope 	 fully 	 	,	to	the	 oper 	 ating 	 	room	where	they	learn	to	be	an	 assist 	 ant 	 	.
then	we	teach	them	to	be	a	surgeon	in	training	.
and	when	they	do	all	of	that	for	about	five	 year 	 s 	 	,	they	get	the	 cove 	 ted 	 	board	 cert 	 ification 	 	.
if	you	need	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	,	you	want	to	be	 oper 	 ated 	 	on	by	a	board	-	 cert 	 ified 	 	surgeon	.
you	get	your	board	certificate	,	and	you	can	go	out	 in 	 to 	 	practice	.
and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	if	you	're	 luck 	 y 	 	,	you	 achiev 	 e 	 	 master 	 y 	 	.
now	that	 found 	 ation 	 	is	so	 import 	 ant 	 	that	a	number	of	us	from	the	largest	general	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 age 	 s 	 	,	 start 	 ed 	 	in	the	late	1990s	a	training	program	that	would	assure	that	every	surgeon	who	 practice 	 s 	 	 minimal 	 ly 	 	invasive	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	would	have	a	strong	 found 	 ation 	 	of	knowledge	and	 skill 	 s 	 	 necess 	 ary 	 	to	go	on	and	do	 procedure 	 s 	 	.
now	the	science	 be 	 hind 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	so	potent	that	it	 be 	 came 	 	 requir 	 ed 	 	by	the	american	board	of	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	in	order	for	a	young	surgeon	to	 be 	 come 	 	board	 cert 	 ified 	 	.
it	's	not	a	 lectur 	 e 	 	,	it	's	not	a	course	,	it	's	all	of	that	plus	a	high	-	 s 	 take 	 s 	 	 assess 	 ment 	 	.
it	's	hard	.
now	just	 th 	 is 	 	past	year	,	one	of	our	 partner 	 s 	 	,	the	american	college	of	 surgeon 	 s 	 	,	 team 	 ed 	 	up	with	us	to	make	an	 announce 	 ment 	 	that	all	 surgeon 	 s 	 	should	be	fls	-	 cert 	 ified 	 	before	they	do	 minimal 	 ly 	 	invasive	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	.
and	are	we	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	just	people	here	in	the	u.s.	and	canada	?
no	,	we	just	 s 	 aid 	 	all	 surgeon 	 s 	 	.
so	to	lift	 th 	 is 	 	education	and	training	 world 	 wide 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	large	task	,	 some 	 thing 	 	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	 personal 	 ly 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	 a 	 s 	 	we	travel	around	the	world	.	 s 	 age 	 s 	 	 do 	 es 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	all	over	the	world	,	 teach 	 ing 	 	and	 educ 	 ating 	 	 surgeon 	 s 	 	.
so	we	have	a	problem	,	and	one	of	the	 problem 	 s 	 	is	distance	.
we	ca	n't	travel	 every 	 where 	 	.
we	need	to	make	the	world	a	 small 	 er 	 	place	.
and	i	think	that	we	can	develop	some	 tool 	 s 	 	to	do	so	.
and	one	of	the	 tool 	 s 	 	i	like	 personal 	 ly 	 	is	using	video	.
so	i	was	inspired	by	a	friend	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	allan	okrainec	from	toronto	.
and	he	 prov 	 ed 	 	that	you	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	teach	people	to	do	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	using	video	 confer 	 encing 	 	.
so	here	's	allan	 teach 	 ing 	 	an	english	-	 s 	 peaking 	 	surgeon	in	africa	these	 bas 	 ic 	 	fundamental	 skill 	 s 	 	 necess 	 ary 	 	to	do	 minimal 	 ly 	 	invasive	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	.
 ver 	 y 	 	inspiring	.
but	for	 th 	 is 	 	examination	,	which	is	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	,	we	have	a	problem	.
even	people	who	say	they	speak	english	,	 on 	 ly 	 	14	percent	pass	.
 be 	 cause 	 	for	them	it	's	not	a	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	test	,	it	's	an	english	test	.
let	me	 br 	 ing 	 	it	to	you	 local 	 ly 	 	.
i	work	at	the	cambridge	hospital	.
it	's	the	 prim 	 ary 	 	harvard	medical	school	 teach 	 ing 	 	 facil 	 ity 	 	.	we	have	more	than	100	 transl 	 ators 	 	 cover 	 ing 	 	63	 language 	 s 	 	,	and	we	 s 	 pend 	 	 million 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	just	in	our	little	hospital	.
it	's	a	big	labor	-	intensive	effort	.
if	you	think	about	the	 world 	 wide 	 	burden	of	 try 	 ing 	 	to	talk	to	your	 patient 	 s 	 	--	not	just	 teach 	 ing 	 	 surgeon 	 s 	 	,	just	 try 	 ing 	 	to	talk	to	your	 patient 	 s 	 	--	there	are	n't	 en 	 ough 	 	 transl 	 ators 	 	in	the	world	.
we	need	to	employ	technology	to	assist	us	in	 th 	 is 	 	quest	.
at	our	hospital	we	see	 every 	 body 	 	from	harvard	 professor 	 s 	 	to	people	who	just	got	here	last	week	.
and	you	have	no	idea	how	hard	it	is	to	talk	to	 some 	 body 	 	or	take	care	of	 some 	 body 	 	you	ca	n't	talk	to	.
and	there	is	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	a	 transl 	 ator 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	.
so	we	need	 tool 	 s 	 	.
we	need	a	universal	 transl 	 ator 	 	.
one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	want	to	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	 a 	 s 	 	you	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	talk	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	talk	is	not	just	about	us	 preach 	 ing 	 	to	the	world	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	about	setting	up	a	 dial 	 ogue 	 	.
we	have	a	lot	to	learn	.
here	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	we	 s 	 pend 	 	more	money	per	person	for	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	that	are	not	better	than	 man 	 y 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	in	the	world	.
 may 	 be 	 	we	have	 some 	 thing 	 	to	learn	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
so	i	'm	passionate	about	 teach 	 ing 	 	these	fls	 skill 	 s 	 	all	over	the	world	.
 th 	 is 	 	past	year	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	in	latin	america	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	in	 chin 	 a 	 	,	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	 fundamental 	 s 	 	of	laparoscopic	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	.
and	 every 	 where 	 	i	go	the	 bar 	 rier 	 	is	:	``	we	want	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	we	need	it	in	our	language	.	``	so	here	's	what	we	think	we	want	to	do	:	imagine	giving	a	 lectur 	 e 	 	and	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	talk	to	people	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	native	language	 simultaneous 	 ly 	 	.
i	want	to	talk	to	the	people	in	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	,	latin	america	,	africa	,	europe	 seam 	 lessly 	 	,	 accurate 	 ly 	 	and	in	a	cost	-	effective	fashion	using	technology	.
and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	bi	-	 direction 	 al 	 	.
they	have	to	be	able	to	teach	us	 some 	 thing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
it	's	a	big	task	.
so	we	 look 	 ed 	 	for	a	universal	 transl 	 ator 	 	;	i	thought	there	would	be	one	out	there	.
your	 web 	 page 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 transl 	 ation 	 	,	your	 cell 	 phone 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 transl 	 ation 	 	,	but	 noth 	 ing 	 	that	's	good	 en 	 ough 	 	to	teach	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	need	a	 lexic 	 on 	 	.	what	is	a	 lexic 	 on 	 	?
a	 lexic 	 on 	 	is	a	body	of	 word 	 s 	 	that	 de 	 scribe 	 s 	 	a	domain	.
i	need	to	have	a	health	care	 lexic 	 on 	 	.
and	in	that	i	need	a	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	 lexic 	 on 	 	.
that	's	a	tall	order	.	we	have	to	work	at	it	.
so	let	me	show	you	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	research	--	ca	n't	buy	it	.
we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	with	the	 folk 	 s 	 	at	ibm	research	from	the	 access 	 ibility 	 	center	to	string	together	 techno 	 logies 	 	to	work	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	universal	 transl 	 ator 	 	.
it	 start 	 s 	 	with	a	 frame 	 work 	 	system	where	when	the	surgeon	 deliver 	 s 	 	the	 lectur 	 e 	 	using	a	 frame 	 work 	 	of	captioning	technology	,	we	then	add	 an 	 other 	 	technology	to	do	video	 confer 	 encing 	 	.
but	we	do	n't	have	the	 word 	 s 	 	yet	,	so	we	add	a	third	technology	.
and	now	we	've	got	the	 word 	 s 	 	,	and	we	can	 app 	 ly 	 	the	special	sauce	:	the	 transl 	 ation 	 	.
we	get	the	 word 	 s 	 	up	in	a	window	and	then	 app 	 ly 	 	the	magic	.
we	work	with	a	fourth	technology	.
and	we	 current 	 ly 	 	have	access	to	eleven	language	 pair 	 s 	 	.
more	to	come	 a 	 s 	 	we	think	about	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	the	world	a	 small 	 er 	 	place	.
and	i	'd	like	to	show	you	our	prototype	of	 string 	 ing 	 	all	of	these	 techno 	 logies 	 	that	do	n't	 necess 	 arily 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	talk	to	each	other	to	 be 	 come 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	.
 nar 	 rator 	 	:	 fundamental 	 s 	 	of	laparoscopic	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	.
 modul 	 e 	 	five	:	manual	 skill 	 s 	 	practice	.
 student 	 s 	 	may	 dis 	 play 	 	 cap 	 tions 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	native	language	.
steven	schwaitzberg	:	if	you	're	in	latin	america	,	you	click	the	``	i	want	it	in	spanish	``	button	and	out	it	 come 	 s 	 	in	real	time	in	spanish	.
but	if	you	happen	to	be	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	beijing	at	the	same	time	,	by	using	technology	in	a	 construct 	 ive 	 	fashion	,	you	could	get	it	in	mandarin	or	you	could	get	it	in	russian	--	on	and	on	and	on	,	 simultaneous 	 ly 	 	 with 	 out 	 	the	use	of	human	 transl 	 ators 	 	.
but	that	's	the	 lectur 	 es 	 	.
if	you	remember	what	i	told	you	about	fls	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	it	's	knowledge	and	 skill 	 s 	 	.
the	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	an	operation	between	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 success 	 fully 	 	and	not	may	be	moving	your	hand	 th 	 is 	 	much	.
so	we	're	going	to	take	it	one	step	further	;	we	've	 br 	 ought 	 	my	friend	allan	back	.
allan	okrainec	:	 to 	 day 	 	we	're	going	to	practice	 sutur 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	how	you	hold	the	needle	.
grab	the	needle	at	the	tip	.
it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	be	accurate	.
aim	for	the	black	 dot 	 s 	 	.
orient	your	loop	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
now	go	 a 	 head 	 	and	cut	.
 ver 	 y 	 	good	oscar	.	i	'll	see	you	next	week	.
ss	:	so	that	's	what	we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	on	in	our	quest	for	the	universal	 transl 	 ator 	 	.
we	want	it	to	be	bi	-	 direction 	 al 	 	.
we	have	a	need	to	learn	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	to	teach	.
i	can	think	of	a	million	uses	for	a	tool	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	we	think	about	 intersect 	 ing 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	--	 every 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	cell	phone	with	a	camera	--	we	could	use	 th 	 is 	 	 every 	 where 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	be	health	care	,	patient	care	,	 engineer 	 ing 	 	,	law	,	 confer 	 encing 	 	,	 transl 	 ating 	 	 video 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ubiqu 	 it 	 ous 	 	tool	.
in	order	to	break	down	our	 bar 	 rier 	 s 	 	,	we	have	to	learn	to	talk	to	people	,	to	demand	that	people	work	on	 transl 	 ation 	 	.
we	need	it	for	our	 every 	 day 	 	life	,	in	order	to	make	the	world	a	 small 	 er 	 	place	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
