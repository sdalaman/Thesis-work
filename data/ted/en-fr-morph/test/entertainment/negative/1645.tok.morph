i	'd	like	to	share	with	you	the	story	of	one	of	my	 patient 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	celine	.
celine	is	a	 house 	 wife 	 	and	 live 	 s 	 	in	a	 r 	 ural 	 	 di 	 strict 	 	of	cameroon	in	west	central	africa	.	six	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	at	the	time	of	her	hiv	 diagnos 	 is 	 	,	she	was	 recruit 	 ed 	 	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	in	the	 clinic 	 al 	 	trial	which	was	running	in	her	health	 di 	 strict 	 	at	the	time	.
when	i	first	met	celine	,	a	little	over	a	year	ago	,	she	had	gone	for	18	 month 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	any	 anti 	 retroviral 	 	therapy	,	and	she	was	 ver 	 y 	 	ill	.
she	told	me	that	she	 stop 	 ped 	 	coming	to	the	clinic	when	the	trial	 end 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	she	had	no	money	for	the	bus	fare	and	was	too	ill	to	walk	the	35	-	kilometer	distance	.
now	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	 clinic 	 al 	 	trial	,	she	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 give 	 n 	 	all	her	 anti 	 retroviral 	 	 drug 	 s 	 	free	of	charge	,	and	her	 transport 	 ation 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	 cover 	 ed 	 	by	the	research	 fund 	 s 	 	.
all	of	these	 end 	 ed 	 	once	the	trial	was	 complete 	 d 	 	,	 leav 	 ing 	 	celine	with	no	 alter 	 native 	 s 	 	.	she	was	 un 	 able 	 	to	tell	me	the	 name 	 s 	 	of	the	 drug 	 s 	 	she	'd	 receiv 	 ed 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	trial	,	or	even	what	the	trial	had	 be 	 en 	 	about	.
i	did	n't	 both 	 er 	 	to	ask	her	what	the	 result 	 s 	 	of	the	trial	 we 	 re 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 seem 	 ed 	 	obvious	to	me	that	she	would	have	no	clue	.
yet	what	 puzzl 	 ed 	 	me	most	was	celine	had	 give 	 n 	 	her	 inform 	 ed 	 	consent	to	be	a	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	trial	,	yet	she	 clear 	 ly 	 	did	not	understand	the	 implic 	 ations 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 particip 	 ant 	 	or	what	would	happen	to	her	once	the	trial	had	 be 	 en 	 	 complete 	 d 	 	.
now	,	i	have	 share 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	story	with	you	 a 	 s 	 	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	what	can	happen	to	 particip 	 ants 	 	in	the	 clinic 	 al 	 	trial	when	it	is	 poor 	 ly 	 	 conduct 	 ed 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	trial	 yield 	 ed 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	 result 	 s 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	it	even	got	 publish 	 ed 	 	in	a	high	-	profile	scientific	journal	.
 may 	 be 	 	it	would	inform	 clinic 	 ians 	 	around	the	world	on	how	to	improve	on	the	 clinic 	 al 	 	management	of	hiv	 patient 	 s 	 	.
but	it	would	have	 d 	 one 	 	so	at	a	price	to	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 patient 	 s 	 	who	,	like	celine	,	 we 	 re 	 	left	to	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	once	the	research	had	 be 	 en 	 	 complete 	 d 	 	.
i	do	not	stand	here	 to 	 day 	 	to	suggest	in	any	way	that	 conduct 	 ing 	 	hiv	 clinic 	 al 	 	 trial 	 s 	 	in	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	is	bad	.
on	the	 contr 	 ary 	 	,	 clinic 	 al 	 	 trial 	 s 	 	are	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	,	and	are	much	 need 	 ed 	 	to	address	the	burden	of	disease	in	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	the	 in 	 equal 	 ities 	 	that	exist	between	 rich 	 er 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	and	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 fund 	 ing 	 	pose	a	real	risk	for	 exploit 	 ation 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	in	the	 con 	 text 	 	of	 external 	 ly 	 	-	funded	research	.
 s 	 ad 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	the	fact	 remain 	 s 	 	that	a	lot	of	the	 stud 	 ies 	 	that	are	 conduct 	 ed 	 	in	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	could	never	be	 author 	 ized 	 	in	the	 rich 	 er 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	which	fund	the	research	.
i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	you	must	be	 ask 	 ing 	 	 your 	 s 	 elves 	 	what	 make 	 s 	 	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	in	sub	-	saharan	africa	,	so	 attract 	 ive 	 	for	these	hiv	 clinic 	 al 	 	 trial 	 s 	 	?
well	,	in	order	for	a	 clinic 	 al 	 	trial	to	generate	valid	and	 wide 	 ly 	 	 appli 	 cable 	 	 result 	 s 	 	,	they	need	to	be	 conduct 	 ed 	 	with	large	 number 	 s 	 	of	 stud 	 y 	 	 particip 	 ants 	 	and	 prefer 	 ably 	 	on	a	population	with	a	high	incidence	of	new	hiv	 infect 	 ions 	 	.
sub	-	saharan	africa	 large 	 ly 	 	 fit 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	,	with	22	million	people	living	with	hiv	,	an	 estimate 	 d 	 	70	percent	of	the	30	million	people	who	are	 infect 	 ed 	 	 world 	 wide 	 	.
 al 	 so 	 	,	research	 with 	 in 	 	the	continent	is	a	lot	 eas 	 ier 	 	to	conduct	due	to	 wide 	 spread 	 	poverty	,	 en 	 demic 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	and	 in 	 ad 	 equate 	 	health	care	 system 	 s 	 	.
a	 clinic 	 al 	 	trial	that	is	 consider 	 ed 	 	to	be	 potential 	 ly 	 	 benefici 	 al 	 	to	the	population	is	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	be	 author 	 ized 	 	,	and	in	the	 ab 	 s 	 ence 	 	of	good	health	care	 system 	 s 	 	,	 al 	 most 	 	any	 off 	 er 	 	of	medical	 assist 	 ance 	 	is	 accept 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	better	than	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
even	more	 problem 	 atic 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	include	lower	risk	of	 litig 	 ation 	 	,	less	 rigor 	 ous 	 	 ethic 	 al 	 	 review 	 s 	 	,	and	 population 	 s 	 	that	are	 will 	 ing 	 	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	in	 al 	 most 	 	any	 stud 	 y 	 	that	 hint 	 s 	 	at	a	cure	.
 a 	 s 	 	 fund 	 ing 	 	for	hiv	research	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	in	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	and	 ethic 	 al 	 	review	in	 rich 	 er 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	 be 	 come 	 	more	strict	,	you	can	see	why	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 text 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 attract 	 ive 	 	.
the	high	 pre 	 valence 	 	of	hiv	 drive 	 s 	 	 research 	 ers 	 	to	conduct	research	that	is	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 scientific 	 ally 	 	 accept 	 able 	 	but	on	 man 	 y 	 	 level 	 s 	 	 ethic 	 ally 	 	 question 	 able 	 	.
how	then	can	we	ensure	that	,	in	our	search	for	the	cure	,	we	do	not	take	an	 un 	 fair 	 	advantage	of	 t 	 hose 	 	who	are	 al 	 ready 	 	most	 affect 	 ed 	 	by	the	 pan 	 demic 	 	?
i	 invit 	 e 	 	you	to	consider	four	 area 	 s 	 	i	think	we	can	focus	on	in	order	to	improve	the	way	in	which	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 d 	 one 	 	.
the	first	of	these	is	 inform 	 ed 	 	consent	.
now	,	in	order	for	a	 clinic 	 al 	 	trial	to	be	 consider 	 ed 	 	 ethic 	 ally 	 	 accept 	 able 	 	,	 particip 	 ants 	 	must	be	 give 	 n 	 	the	relevant	information	in	a	way	in	which	they	can	understand	,	and	must	 free 	 ly 	 	consent	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	in	the	trial	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	in	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	where	a	lot	of	 particip 	 ants 	 	consent	to	research	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 believ 	 e 	 	it	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	in	which	they	can	 receiv 	 e 	 	medical	care	or	other	 benefit 	 s 	 	.
consent	 procedure 	 s 	 	that	are	used	in	 rich 	 er 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	are	often	 in 	 appropriate 	 	or	 in 	 effective 	 	in	a	lot	of	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	it	is	 counter 	 intuitive 	 	to	have	an	illiterate	 stud 	 y 	 	 particip 	 ant 	 	,	like	celine	,	sign	a	 length 	 y 	 	consent	form	that	they	are	 un 	 able 	 	to	read	,	let	 al 	 one 	 	understand	.
local	 commun 	 ities 	 	need	to	be	more	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 establish 	 ing 	 	the	 cri 	 ter 	 ia 	 	for	 recruit 	 ing 	 	 particip 	 ants 	 	in	 clinic 	 al 	 	 trial 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	the	 incentive 	 s 	 	for	 particip 	 ation 	 	.
the	information	in	these	 trial 	 s 	 	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 give 	 n 	 	to	the	potential	 particip 	 ants 	 	in	 linguist 	 ically 	 	and	 cultural 	 ly 	 	 accept 	 able 	 	 format 	 s 	 	.
the	second	point	i	would	like	for	you	to	consider	is	the	standard	of	care	that	is	 provide 	 d 	 	to	 particip 	 ants 	 	 with 	 in 	 	any	 clinic 	 al 	 	trial	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	subject	to	a	lot	of	debate	and	 contr 	 over 	 s 	 y 	 	.	should	the	control	group	in	the	 clinic 	 al 	 	trial	be	 give 	 n 	 	the	best	current	 treat 	 ment 	 	which	is	 avail 	 able 	 	 any 	 where 	 	in	the	world	?
or	should	they	be	 give 	 n 	 	an	 alter 	 native 	 	standard	of	care	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	best	current	 treat 	 ment 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	in	the	country	in	which	the	research	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 conduct 	 ed 	 	?
is	it	fair	to	evaluate	a	 treat 	 ment 	 	regimen	which	may	not	be	 afford 	 able 	 	or	 access 	 ible 	 	to	the	 stud 	 y 	 	 particip 	 ants 	 	once	the	research	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 complete 	 d 	 	?
now	,	in	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	where	the	best	current	 treat 	 ment 	 	is	 in 	 expensive 	 	and	simple	to	deliver	,	the	answer	is	 straight 	 forward 	 	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	the	best	current	 treat 	 ment 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	 any 	 where 	 	in	the	world	is	often	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	to	provide	in	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	.
it	is	 import 	 ant 	 	to	assess	the	potential	 risk 	 s 	 	and	 benefit 	 s 	 	of	the	standard	of	care	which	is	to	be	 provide 	 d 	 	to	 particip 	 ants 	 	in	any	 clinic 	 al 	 	trial	,	and	establish	one	which	is	relevant	for	the	 con 	 text 	 	of	the	 stud 	 y 	 	and	most	 benefici 	 al 	 	for	the	 particip 	 ants 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	 stud 	 y 	 	.
that	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	us	to	the	third	point	i	want	you	think	about	:	the	 ethic 	 al 	 	review	of	research	.
an	effective	system	for	 review 	 ing 	 	the	 ethic 	 al 	 	suitability	of	 clinic 	 al 	 	 trial 	 s 	 	is	primordial	to	 safe 	 guard 	 	 particip 	 ants 	 	 with 	 in 	 	any	 clinic 	 al 	 	trial	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	often	 lack 	 ing 	 	or	 in 	 efficient 	 	in	a	lot	of	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	.
local	 government 	 s 	 	need	to	set	up	effective	 system 	 s 	 	for	 review 	 ing 	 	the	 ethic 	 al 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	around	the	 clinic 	 al 	 	 trial 	 s 	 	which	are	 author 	 ized 	 	in	different	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	and	they	need	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	by	setting	up	 ethic 	 al 	 	review	 commit 	 tee 	 s 	 	that	are	 in 	 dependent 	 	of	the	government	and	research	 sponsor 	 s 	 	.
public	 account 	 ability 	 	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 promote 	 d 	 	through	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	and	 in 	 dependent 	 	review	by	nongovernmental	and	 inter 	 national 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	appropriate	.
the	final	point	i	would	like	for	you	to	consider	 to 	 night 	 	is	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	 particip 	 ants 	 	in	the	 clinic 	 al 	 	trial	once	the	research	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 complete 	 d 	 	.
i	think	it	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	wrong	for	research	to	begin	in	the	first	place	 with 	 out 	 	a	clear	plan	for	what	would	happen	to	the	 particip 	 ants 	 	once	the	trial	 ha 	 s 	 	 end 	 ed 	 	.
now	,	 research 	 ers 	 	need	to	make	every	effort	to	ensure	that	an	intervention	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 show 	 n 	 	to	be	 benefici 	 al 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	a	 clinic 	 al 	 	trial	is	 access 	 ible 	 	to	the	 particip 	 ants 	 	of	the	trial	once	the	trial	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 complete 	 d 	 	.
in	 add 	 ition 	 	,	they	should	be	able	to	consider	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	 introduc 	 ing 	 	and	 maintain 	 ing 	 	effective	 treat 	 ments 	 	in	the	 wide 	 r 	 	community	once	the	trial	 end 	 s 	 	.
if	,	for	any	reason	,	they	feel	that	 th 	 is 	 	might	not	be	possible	,	then	i	think	they	should	have	to	 ethic 	 ally 	 	 just 	 ify 	 	why	the	 clinic 	 al 	 	trial	should	be	 conduct 	 ed 	 	in	the	first	place	.
now	,	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	for	celine	,	our	 meet 	 ing 	 	did	not	end	in	my	 off 	 ice 	 	.
i	was	able	to	get	her	 enroll 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	free	hiv	 treat 	 ment 	 	program	 close 	 r 	 	to	her	home	,	and	with	a	support	group	to	help	her	cope	.
her	story	 ha 	 s 	 	a	positive	 end 	 ing 	 	,	but	there	are	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 other 	 s 	 	in	similar	 situ 	 ations 	 	who	are	much	less	fortunate	.
 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	she	may	not	know	 th 	 is 	 	,	my	 en 	 counter 	 	with	celine	 ha 	 s 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	 change 	 d 	 	the	way	in	which	i	view	hiv	 clinic 	 al 	 	 trial 	 s 	 	in	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	and	made	me	even	more	 determine 	 d 	 	to	be	part	of	the	 move 	 ment 	 	to	change	the	way	in	which	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 d 	 one 	 	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	every	single	person	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	me	 to 	 night 	 	can	be	part	of	that	change	.
if	you	are	a	 research 	 er 	 	,	i	hold	you	to	a	 high 	 er 	 	standard	of	moral	 con 	 science 	 	,	to	remain	 ethic 	 al 	 	in	your	research	,	and	not	 com 	 promise 	 	human	 wel 	 fare 	 	in	your	search	for	 answer 	 s 	 	.
if	you	work	for	a	 fund 	 ing 	 	 age 	 ncy 	 	or	pharmaceutical	company	,	i	 challeng 	 e 	 	you	to	hold	your	 employ 	 ers 	 	to	fund	research	that	is	 ethic 	 ally 	 	sound	.
if	you	come	from	a	 develop 	 ing 	 	country	like	 my 	 self 	 	,	i	urge	you	to	hold	your	government	to	a	more	thorough	review	of	the	 clinic 	 al 	 	 trial 	 s 	 	which	are	 author 	 ized 	 	in	your	country	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	there	is	a	need	for	us	to	find	a	cure	for	hiv	,	to	find	an	effective	 vaccin 	 e 	 	for	malaria	,	to	find	a	 diagnos 	 tic 	 	tool	that	 work 	 s 	 	for	t.b	.	,	but	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	we	owe	it	to	 t 	 hose 	 	who	 will 	 ing 	 ly 	 	and	 self 	 lessly 	 	consent	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	in	these	 clinic 	 al 	 	 trial 	 s 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	in	a	 human 	 e 	 	way	.
thank	you	.
