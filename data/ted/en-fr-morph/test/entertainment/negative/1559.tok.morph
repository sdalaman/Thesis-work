i	thought	i	would	start	with	a	 ver 	 y 	 	brief	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	cities	.
 settle 	 ments 	 	 typical 	 ly 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	with	people	 cluster 	 ed 	 	around	a	well	,	and	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	that	 settle 	 ment 	 	was	 rough 	 ly 	 	the	distance	you	could	walk	with	a	pot	of	water	on	your	head	.
in	fact	,	if	you	fly	over	germany	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	and	you	look	down	and	you	see	these	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	little	 village 	 s 	 	,	they	're	all	about	a	mile	 a 	 part 	 	.
you	 need 	 ed 	 	easy	access	to	the	 field 	 s 	 	.
and	for	 hundred 	 s 	 	,	even	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	home	was	 re 	 ally 	 	the	center	of	life	.
life	was	 ver 	 y 	 	small	for	most	people	.
it	was	the	center	of	 entertain 	 ment 	 	,	of	energy	production	,	of	work	,	the	center	of	health	care	.
that	's	where	 bab 	 ies 	 	 we 	 re 	 	born	and	people	 di 	 ed 	 	.
then	,	with	 industrial 	 ization 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	 central 	 ized 	 	.
you	had	 dirt 	 y 	 	 factor 	 ies 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 move 	 d 	 	to	the	 out 	 skirt 	 s 	 	of	cities	.
production	was	 central 	 ized 	 	in	 assem 	 bly 	 	 plant 	 s 	 	.
you	had	 central 	 ized 	 	energy	production	.
 learn 	 ing 	 	took	place	in	 school 	 s 	 	.	health	care	took	place	in	 hospital 	 s 	 	.
and	then	you	had	 network 	 s 	 	that	 develop 	 ed 	 	.
you	had	water	,	 sew 	 er 	 	 network 	 s 	 	that	 allow 	 ed 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 un 	 check 	 ed 	 	expansion	.
you	had	 separat 	 ed 	 	 function 	 s 	 	,	 increasing 	 ly 	 	.
you	had	rail	 network 	 s 	 	that	 connect 	 ed 	 	 resident 	 ial 	 	,	industrial	,	commercial	 area 	 s 	 	.	you	had	auto	 network 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	the	model	was	 re 	 ally 	 	,	give	 every 	 body 	 	a	car	,	build	 road 	 s 	 	to	 every 	 thing 	 	,	and	give	people	a	place	to	park	when	they	get	there	.	it	was	not	a	 ver 	 y 	 	functional	model	.
and	we	still	live	in	that	world	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	end	up	with	.
so	you	have	the	sprawl	of	la	,	the	sprawl	of	mexico	city	.
you	have	these	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	new	cities	in	 chin 	 a 	 	which	you	might	call	tower	sprawl	.
they	're	all	building	cities	on	the	model	that	we	 invent 	 ed 	 	in	the	'50s	and	'60s	,	which	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 obsolet 	 e 	 	,	i	would	 argu 	 e 	 	,	and	there	are	 hundred 	 s 	 	and	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	new	cities	that	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 plan 	 ned 	 	all	over	the	world	.
in	 chin 	 a 	 	 al 	 one 	 	,	300	million	people	,	some	say	400	million	people	,	will	move	to	the	city	over	the	next	15	 year 	 s 	 	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	building	the	entire	,	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	the	entire	built	 infra 	 structure 	 	of	the	u.s.	in	15	 year 	 s 	 	.
imagine	that	.
and	we	should	all	care	about	 th 	 is 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	you	live	in	cities	or	not	.
cities	will	account	for	90	percent	of	the	population	growth	,	80	percent	of	the	global	co	2	,	75	percent	of	energy	use	,	but	at	the	same	time	it	's	where	people	want	to	be	,	 increasing 	 ly 	 	.
more	than	half	the	people	now	in	the	world	live	in	cities	,	and	that	will	just	 continu 	 e 	 	to	 escal 	 ate 	 	.	cities	are	 place 	 s 	 	of	 celebr 	 ation 	 	,	personal	 express 	 ion 	 	.
you	have	the	flash	 mob 	 s 	 	of	 pil 	 low 	 	 fight 	 s 	 	that	--	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	to	a	couple	.	they	're	 quit 	 e 	 	 f 	 un 	 	.
you	have	--	cities	are	where	most	of	the	wealth	is	 create 	 d 	 	,	and	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	,	it	's	where	women	find	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	.	that	's
a	lot	of	the	reason	why	cities	are	growing	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
now	there	's	some	 trend 	 s 	 	that	will	impact	cities	.
first	of	all	,	work	is	 be 	 coming 	 	 distribut 	 ed 	 	and	mobile	.
the	 off 	 ice 	 	building	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	 obsolet 	 e 	 	for	 do 	 ing 	 	private	work	.
the	home	,	once	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 distribut 	 ed 	 	computation	--	communication	,	is	 be 	 coming 	 	a	center	of	life	,	so	it	's	a	center	of	production	and	 learn 	 ing 	 	and	 shop 	 ping 	 	and	health	care	and	all	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	used	to	think	of	 a 	 s 	 	taking	place	 out 	 side 	 	of	the	home	.
and	 increasing 	 ly 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	that	people	buy	,	every	consumer	product	,	in	one	way	or	 an 	 other 	 	,	can	be	 personal 	 ized 	 	.
and	that	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	trend	to	think	about	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	image	of	the	city	of	the	future	.
in	that	it	's	a	place	for	people	,	you	know	.
 may 	 be 	 	not	the	way	people	dress	,	but	--	you	know	,	the	question	now	is	,	how	can	we	have	all	the	good	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	identify	with	cities	 with 	 out 	 	all	the	bad	 thing 	 s 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	bangalore	.	it	took	me	a	couple	of	 hour 	 s 	 	to	get	a	few	 mile 	 s 	 	in	bangalore	last	year	.
so	with	cities	,	you	 al 	 so 	 	have	 con 	 gest 	 ion 	 	and	 poll 	 ution 	 	and	disease	and	all	these	negative	 thing 	 s 	 	.
how	can	we	have	the	good	stuff	 with 	 out 	 	the	bad	?
so	we	went	back	and	 start 	 ed 	 	looking	at	the	great	cities	that	 evolv 	 ed 	 	before	the	 car 	 s 	 	.
paris	was	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	these	little	 village 	 s 	 	that	came	together	,	and	you	still	see	that	structure	 to 	 day 	 	.
the	20	arrondissements	of	paris	are	these	little	 neighbor 	 hood 	 s 	 	.
most	of	what	people	need	in	life	can	be	 with 	 in 	 	a	five	-	or	10	-	minute	walk	.
and	if	you	look	at	the	data	,	when	you	have	that	kind	of	a	structure	,	you	get	a	 ver 	 y 	 	even	 distribut 	 ion 	 	of	the	 shop 	 s 	 	and	the	 physician 	 s 	 	and	the	pharmacies	and	the	 cafe 	 s 	 	in	paris	.
and	then	you	look	at	cities	that	 evolv 	 ed 	 	after	the	 auto 	 mobile 	 	,	and	it	's	not	that	kind	of	a	pattern	.
there	's	 ver 	 y 	 	little	that	's	 with 	 in 	 	a	five	minute	walk	of	most	 area 	 s 	 	of	 place 	 s 	 	like	pittsburgh	.
not	to	pick	on	pittsburgh	,	but	most	american	cities	 re 	 ally 	 	have	 evolv 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
so	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	we	'll	,	let	's	look	at	new	cities	,	and	we	're	 involve 	 d 	 	in	a	couple	of	new	city	 project 	 s 	 	in	 chin 	 a 	 	.
so	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	let	's	start	with	that	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	cell	.
we	think	of	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	compact	urban	cell	.
so	provide	most	of	what	most	people	want	 with 	 in 	 	that	20	-	minute	walk	.
 th 	 is 	 	can	 al 	 so 	 	be	a	 resili 	 ent 	 	 electric 	 al 	 	microgrid	,	community	 heat 	 ing 	 	,	power	,	communication	 network 	 s 	 	,	etc	.	,	can	be	 concent 	 rated 	 	there	.
stewart	brand	would	put	a	micro	-	nuclear	reactor	right	in	the	center	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	.
and	he	might	be	right	.
and	then	we	can	form	,	in	effect	,	a	mesh	network	.
it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	of	an	 inter 	 net 	 	 typo 	 logy 	 	pattern	,	so	you	can	have	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	these	 neighbor 	 hood 	 s 	 	.
you	can	dial	up	the	density	--	about	20,000	people	per	cell	if	it	's	cambridge	.	go	up	to	50,000	if	it	's	manhattan	density	.	you	connect	 every 	 thing 	 	with	mass	transit	and	you	provide	most	of	what	most	people	need	 with 	 in 	 	that	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	.
you	can	begin	to	develop	a	whole	 typo 	 logy 	 	of	streetscapes	and	the	 vehicle 	 s 	 	that	can	go	on	them	.	i	wo	n't	go	through	all	of	them	.	i	'll	just	show	one	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	boulder	.	it	's	a	great	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	kind	of	a	 mobil 	 ity 	 	parkway	,	a	superhighway	for	 jog 	 gers 	 	and	bicyclists	where	you	can	go	from	one	end	of	the	city	to	the	other	 with 	 out 	 	 cross 	 ing 	 	the	street	,	and	they	 al 	 so 	 	have	bike	-	sharing	,	which	i	'll	get	 in 	 to 	 	in	a	minute	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	even	a	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	solution	in	seoul	,	korea	.
they	took	the	 elev 	 ated 	 	 high 	 way 	 	,	they	got	rid	of	it	,	they	 re 	 claim 	 ed 	 	the	street	,	the	river	down	 be 	 low 	 	,	 be 	 low 	 	the	street	,	and	you	can	go	from	one	end	of	seoul	to	the	other	 with 	 out 	 	 cross 	 ing 	 	a	 path 	 way 	 	for	 car 	 s 	 	.
the	highline	in	manhattan	is	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	.
you	have	these	 rapid 	 ly 	 	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	bike	 lane 	 s 	 	all	over	the	world	.	i	lived	in	manhattan	for	15	 year 	 s 	 	.
i	went	back	a	couple	of	 week 	 end 	 s 	 	ago	,	took	 th 	 is 	 	photograph	of	these	fabulous	new	bike	 lane 	 s 	 	that	they	have	 install 	 ed 	 	.
they	're	still	not	to	where	copenhagen	is	,	where	 some 	 thing 	 	like	42	percent	of	the	 trip 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	city	are	by	 bi 	 cycle 	 	.	it	's	 most 	 ly 	 	just	 be 	 cause 	 	they	have	fantastic	 infra 	 structure 	 	there	.
we	 actual 	 ly 	 	did	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	wrong	thing	in	boston	.
we	--	the	big	dig	--	so	we	got	rid	of	the	 high 	 way 	 	but	we	 create 	 d 	 	a	traffic	 is 	 land 	 	and	it	's	 certain 	 ly 	 	not	a	 mobil 	 ity 	 	 path 	 way 	 	for	 any 	 thing 	 	other	than	 car 	 s 	 	.
 mobil 	 ity 	 	on	demand	is	 some 	 thing 	 	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	,	so	we	think	we	need	an	 eco 	 system 	 	of	these	 share 	 d 	 	-	use	 vehicle 	 s 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	mass	transit	.
these	are	some	of	the	 vehicle 	 s 	 	that	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	.
but	 share 	 d 	 	use	is	 re 	 ally 	 	key	.	if	you	share	a	vehicle	,	you	can	have	at	 l 	 east 	 	four	people	use	one	vehicle	,	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	one	.
we	have	hubway	here	in	boston	,	the	v√©lib	'	system	in	paris	.
we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 develop 	 ing 	 	at	the	media	lab	 th 	 is 	 	little	city	car	that	is	 optimize 	 d 	 	for	 share 	 d 	 	use	in	cities	.
we	got	rid	of	all	the	 use 	 less 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 engine 	 s 	 	and	 trans 	 mission 	 s 	 	.	we	 move 	 d 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	to	the	 wheel 	 s 	 	,	so	you	have	the	drive	motor	,	the	 steer 	 ing 	 	motor	,	the	 break 	 ing 	 	all	in	the	wheel	.
that	left	the	 cha 	 s 	 sis 	 	unencumbered	,	so	you	can	do	 thing 	 s 	 	like	fold	,	so	you	can	fold	 th 	 is 	 	little	vehicle	up	to	occupy	a	 tin 	 y 	 	little	 foot 	 print 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	video	that	was	on	european	 tele 	 vision 	 	last	week	 show 	 ing 	 	the	spanish	 mini 	 ster 	 	of	industry	 driv 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	little	vehicle	,	and	when	it	's	 fold 	 ed 	 	,	it	can	spin	.
you	do	n't	need	reverse	.	you	do	n't	need	parallel	 park 	 ing 	 	.
you	just	spin	and	go	 direct 	 ly 	 	in	.	so	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	with	a	company	to	commercialize	 th 	 is 	 	.	my	phd	student	ryan	chin	 present 	 ed 	 	these	early	 idea 	 s 	 	two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	at	a	 ted 	 x 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	.
so	what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	,	then	if	you	begin	to	add	new	 thing 	 s 	 	to	it	,	like	 auto 	 nomy 	 	,	you	get	out	of	the	car	,	you	park	at	your	destination	,	you	pat	it	on	the	butt	,	it	 go 	 es 	 	and	it	 park 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	,	it	 charge 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	,	and	you	can	get	 some 	 thing 	 	like	seven	 time 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 vehicle 	 s 	 	in	a	 give 	 n 	 	area	 a 	 s 	 	 convention 	 al 	 	 car 	 s 	 	,	and	we	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	future	.	 actual 	 ly 	 	we	could	do	 th 	 is 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
it	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	a	problem	.
we	can	combine	 share 	 d 	 	use	and	 fold 	 ing 	 	and	 auto 	 nomy 	 	and	we	get	 some 	 thing 	 	like	28	 time 	 s 	 	the	land	utilization	with	that	kind	of	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	.
one	of	our	graduate	 student 	 s 	 	then	 say 	 s 	 	,	well	,	how	 do 	 es 	 	a	 driver 	 less 	 	car	communicate	with	 pedestrian 	 s 	 	?
you	have	 no 	 body 	 	to	make	eye	contact	with	.
you	do	n't	know	if	it	's	going	to	run	you	over	.
so	he	's	 develop 	 ing 	 	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	so	the	vehicle	can	communicate	with	 pedestrian 	 s 	 	,	so	--	so	the	 head 	 light 	 s 	 	are	 eye 	 ball 	 s 	 	,	the	 pupil 	 s 	 	can	dilate	,	we	have	 direction 	 al 	 	audio	,	we	can	throw	sound	 direct 	 ly 	 	at	people	.
what	i	love	about	 th 	 is 	 	project	is	he	 solve 	 d 	 	a	problem	that	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	,	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	exist	yet	,	so	--	we	 al 	 so 	 	think	that	we	can	 democrat 	 ize 	 	access	to	bike	 lane 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	bike	 lane 	 s 	 	are	 most 	 ly 	 	used	by	young	 guy 	 s 	 	in	 stretch 	 y 	 	pants	,	you	know	.	so	--
we	think	we	can	develop	a	vehicle	that	 oper 	 ates 	 	on	bike	 lane 	 s 	 	,	 access 	 ible 	 	to	 elder 	 ly 	 	and	 dis 	 able 	 d 	 	,	women	in	 skirt 	 s 	 	,	 business 	 people 	 	,	and	address	the	 issue 	 s 	 	of	energy	 con 	 gest 	 ion 	 	,	 mobil 	 ity 	 	,	aging	and	 obes 	 ity 	 	 simultaneous 	 ly 	 	.	that	's	our	 challeng 	 e 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	early	design	for	 th 	 is 	 	little	three	-	wheel	,	it	's	an	 electron 	 ic 	 	bike	.	you	have	to	 ped 	 al 	 	to	 oper 	 ate 	 	it	in	a	bike	lane	,	but	if	you	're	an	 old 	 er 	 	person	,	that	's	a	 s 	 witch 	 	.	if	you	're	a	 health 	 y 	 	person	,	you	might	have	to	work	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	to	go	fast	.
you	can	dial	in	40	 calorie 	 s 	 	going	 in 	 to 	 	work	and	500	going	home	,	when	you	can	take	a	shower	.
we	hope	to	have	that	built	 th 	 is 	 	fall	.
housing	is	 an 	 other 	 	area	where	we	can	 re 	 ally 	 	improve	.
mayor	menino	in	boston	 say 	 s 	 	lack	of	 afford 	 able 	 	housing	for	young	people	is	one	of	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	the	city	 face 	 s 	 	.
 develop 	 ers 	 	say	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	we	'll	build	little	 teen 	 y 	 	 a 	 part 	 ments 	 	.
people	say	,	we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	live	in	a	little	 teen 	 y 	 	 convention 	 al 	 	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	.
so	we	're	 say 	 ing 	 	let	's	build	a	 standard 	 ized 	 	 cha 	 s 	 sis 	 	,	much	like	our	car	.	let	's	 br 	 ing 	 	 advance 	 d 	 	technology	 in 	 to 	 	the	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	,	technology	-	enabled	 in 	 fill 	 	,	give	people	the	 tool 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	 th 	 is 	 	open	-	loft	 cha 	 s 	 sis 	 	to	go	through	a	process	of	 defi 	 ning 	 	what	 the 	 ir 	 	 need 	 s 	 	and	 value 	 s 	 	and	 activ 	 ities 	 	are	,	and	then	a	 match 	 ing 	 	algorithm	will	match	a	 un 	 ique 	 	 assem 	 bly 	 	of	 integrate 	 d 	 	 in 	 fill 	 	 component 	 s 	 	,	furniture	,	and	cabinetry	,	that	are	 personal 	 ized 	 	to	that	individual	,	and	they	give	them	the	 tool 	 s 	 	to	go	through	the	process	and	to	refine	it	,	and	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 work 	 ing 	 	with	an	architect	,	where	the	 dial 	 ogue 	 	 start 	 s 	 	when	you	give	an	 alter 	 native 	 	to	a	person	to	react	to	.
now	,	the	most	 interest 	 ing 	 	 implement 	 ation 	 	of	that	for	us	is	when	you	can	begin	to	have	robotic	 wall 	 s 	 	,	so	your	space	can	convert	from	 exercis 	 e 	 	to	a	 work 	 place 	 	,	if	you	run	a	virtual	company	.
you	have	 guest 	 s 	 	over	,	you	have	two	guestrooms	that	are	 develop 	 ed 	 	.
you	have	a	 convention 	 al 	 	one	-	 bed 	 room 	 	 arrange 	 ment 	 	when	you	need	it	.	 may 	 be 	 	that	's	most	of	the	time	.
you	have	a	 d 	 inner 	 	party	.	the	table	 fold 	 s 	 	out	to	fit	16	people	in	 other 	 wise 	 	a	 convention 	 al 	 	one	-	 bed 	 room 	 	,	or	 may 	 be 	 	you	want	a	dance	studio	.
i	mean	,	 architect 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	these	 idea 	 s 	 
for	a	long	time	.	what	we	need	to	do	now	,	develop	 thing 	 s 	 	that	can	scale	to	 t 	 hose 	 	300	million	chinese	people	that	would	like	to	live	in	the	city	,	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 comfort 	 ably 	 	.
we	think	we	can	make	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	that	 function 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	if	it	's	twice	 a 	 s 	 	big	by	 util 	 izing 	 	these	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	.	i	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	in	smart	 home 	 s 	 	.
that	's	sort	of	a	 bog 	 us 	 	 con 	 cept 	 	.
i	think	you	have	to	build	dumb	 home 	 s 	 	and	put	smart	stuff	in	it	.
and	so	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	a	 cha 	 s 	 sis 	 	of	the	wall	 it 	 self 	 	.
you	know	,	 standard 	 ized 	 	platform	with	the	 motor 	 s 	 	and	the	 batt 	 ery 	 	when	it	 oper 	 ates 	 	,	little	 sole 	 noids 	 	that	will	lock	it	in	place	and	get	low	-	 volt 	 age 	 	power	.
we	think	 th 	 is 	 	can	all	be	 standard 	 ized 	 	,	and	then	people	can	 personal 	 ize 	 	the	stuff	that	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	that	wall	,	and	like	the	car	,	we	can	integrate	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 sens 	 ing 	 	to	be	aware	of	human	activity	,	so	if	there	's	a	baby	or	a	puppy	in	the	way	,	you	wo	n't	have	a	problem	.
so	the	 develop 	 ers 	 	say	,	well	 th 	 is 	 	is	great	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	if	we	have	a	 convention 	 al 	 	building	,	we	have	a	 fix 	 ed 	 	 envelop 	 e 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	we	can	put	in	14	 unit 	 s 	 	.
if	they	function	 a 	 s 	 	if	they	're	twice	 a 	 s 	 	big	,	we	can	get	28	 unit 	 s 	 	in	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	twice	 a 	 s 	 	much	 park 	 ing 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	.
 park 	 ing 	 	's	 re 	 ally 	 	expensive	.	it	's	about	70,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	per	space	to	build	a	 convention 	 al 	 	 park 	 ing 	 	spot	 in 	 side 	 	a	building	.
so	if	you	can	have	 fold 	 ing 	 	and	 auto 	 nomy 	 	,	you	can	do	that	in	one	 seven 	 th 	 	of	the	space	.
that	 go 	 es 	 	down	to	10,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	per	car	,	just	for	the	cost	of	the	 park 	 ing 	 	.
you	add	 share 	 d 	 	use	,	and	you	can	even	go	further	.
we	can	 al 	 so 	 	integrate	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 advance 	 d 	 	technology	through	 th 	 is 	 	process	.	there	's	a	path	to	market	for	 innov 	 ative 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	technology	 in 	 to 	 	the	home	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	a	project	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	with	siemens	,	we	have	 sensor 	 s 	 	on	all	the	furniture	,	all	the	 in 	 fill 	 	,	that	 understand 	 s 	 	where	people	are	and	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	.
blue	light	is	 ver 	 y 	 	efficient	,	so	we	have	these	tunable	24	-	bit	led	 light 	 ing 	 	fixtures	.
it	 recogn 	 ize 	 s 	 	where	the	person	is	,	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	,	 fill 	 s 	 	out	the	light	when	 necess 	 ary 	 	to	full	spectrum	white	light	,	and	 s 	 ave 	 s 	 	 may 	 be 	 	30	,	40	percent	in	energy	consumption	,	we	think	,	over	even	 convention 	 al 	 	state	-	of	-	the	-	art	 light 	 ing 	 	 system 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	just	 show 	 s 	 	you	the	data	that	 come 	 s 	 	from	the	 sensor 	 s 	 	that	are	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	in	the	furniture	.
we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	in	 camera 	 s 	 	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	in	 home 	 s 	 	.
we	think	these	little	 wire 	 less 	 	 sensor 	 s 	 	are	more	effective	.
we	think	we	can	 al 	 so 	 	 personal 	 ize 	 	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	.
that	's	sort	of	the	ultimate	 personal 	 ization 	 	in	some	ways	.
so	we	,	we	've	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 articul 	 ating 	 	 mirror 	 s 	 	of	the	facade	that	can	throw	 shaft 	 s 	 	of	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	 any 	 where 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	space	,	 there 	 fore 	 	 allow 	 ing 	 	you	to	 sha 	 de 	 	most	of	the	glass	on	a	hot	day	like	 to 	 day 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	she	 pick 	 s 	 	up	her	phone	,	she	can	map	food	 pre 	 par 	 ation 	 	at	the	kitchen	 is 	 land 	 	to	a	 part 	 icular 	 	location	of	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	.	an	algorithm	will	keep	it	in	that	location	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	she	's	 engag 	 ed 	 	in	that	activity	.
 th 	 is 	 	can	be	 combine 	 d 	 	with	led	 light 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
we	think	 work 	 place 	 s 	 	should	be	 share 	 d 	 	.
i	mean	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	the	 work 	 place 	 	of	the	future	,	i	think	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	starbucks	,	you	know	.
 may 	 be 	 	a	third	--	and	you	see	 every 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	back	to	the	wall	and	they	have	food	and	coffee	down	the	way	and	they	're	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	little	personal	bubble	.
we	need	 share 	 d 	 	 space 	 s 	 	for	 interact 	 ion 	 	and	 collabor 	 ation 	 	.
we	're	not	 do 	 ing 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	job	with	that	.
at	the	cambridge	 innov 	 ation 	 	center	,	you	can	have	 share 	 d 	 	 desk 	 s 	 	.	i	've	 s 	 pent 	 	a	lot	of	time	in	finland	at	the	design	 factor 	 y 	 	of	aalto	university	,	where	the	they	have	a	 share 	 d 	 	shop	and	 share 	 d 	 	fablab	,	 share 	 d 	 	quiet	 space 	 s 	 	,	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	 space 	 s 	 	,	 re 	 creation 	 	 place 	 s 	 	.
we	think	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	can	come	together	,	a	new	model	for	 mobil 	 ity 	 	,	a	new	model	for	housing	,	a	new	model	for	how	we	live	and	work	,	a	path	to	market	for	 advance 	 d 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	but	in	the	end	the	main	thing	we	need	to	focus	on	are	people	.	cities	are	all	about	people	.
they	're	 place 	 s 	 	for	people	.
there	's	no	reason	why	we	ca	n't	 dramat 	 ically 	 	improve	the	livability	and	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	of	cities	like	they	've	 d 	 one 	 	in	melbourne	with	the	laneways	while	at	the	same	time	 dramat 	 ically 	 	 reduc 	 ing 	 	co	2	and	energy	.
it	's	a	global	 imper 	 ative 	 	.	we	have	to	get	 th 	 is 	 	right	.
thank	you	.
