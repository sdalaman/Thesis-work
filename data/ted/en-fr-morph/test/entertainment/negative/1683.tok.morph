the	most	massive	tsunami	perfect	storm	is	 bear 	 ing 	 	down	 up 	 on 	 	us	.
 th 	 is 	 	perfect	storm	is	 mount 	 ing 	 	a	grim	 re 	 ality 	 	,	 increasing 	 ly 	 	grim	 re 	 ality 	 	,	and	we	are	facing	that	 re 	 ality 	 	with	the	full	belief	that	we	can	solve	our	 problem 	 s 	 	with	technology	,	and	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 understand 	 able 	 	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	perfect	storm	that	we	are	facing	is	the	result	of	our	 ris 	 ing 	 	population	,	 ris 	 ing 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	10	billion	people	,	land	that	is	 turn 	 ing 	 	to	desert	,	and	,	of	course	,	climate	change	.
now	there	's	no	question	about	it	at	all	:	we	will	 on 	 ly 	 	solve	the	problem	of	 re 	 placing 	 	fossil	 fuel 	 s 	 	with	technology	.
but	fossil	 fuel 	 s 	 	--	carbon	,	coal	and	gas	--	are	by	no	 mean 	 s 	 	the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	that	is	 caus 	 ing 	 	climate	change	.
 desert 	 ification 	 	is	a	 f 	 ancy 	 	word	for	land	that	is	 turn 	 ing 	 	to	desert	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	when	we	create	too	much	bare	ground	.
there	's	no	other	cause	.
and	i	intend	to	focus	on	most	of	the	world	's	land	that	is	 turn 	 ing 	 	to	desert	.
but	i	have	for	you	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 mess 	 age 	 	that	 off 	 ers 	 	more	hope	than	you	can	imagine	.
we	have	 environment 	 s 	 	where	 hu 	 mid 	 ity 	 	is	 guarantee 	 d 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	year	.
on	 t 	 hose 	 	,	it	is	 al 	 most 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	to	create	vast	 area 	 s 	 	of	bare	ground	.
no	matter	what	you	do	,	nature	 cover 	 s 	 	it	up	so	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
and	we	have	 environment 	 s 	 	where	we	have	 month 	 s 	 	of	 hu 	 mid 	 ity 	 	 follow 	 ed 	 	by	 month 	 s 	 	of	 dry 	 ness 	 	,	and	that	is	where	 desert 	 ification 	 	is	 occur 	 ring 	 	.
 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	with	space	technology	now	,	we	can	look	at	it	from	space	,	and	when	we	do	,	you	can	see	the	 proportion 	 s 	 	 fair 	 ly 	 	well	.
 general 	 ly 	 	,	what	you	see	in	green	is	not	 desert 	 ifying 	 	,	and	what	you	see	in	 brow 	 n 	 	is	,	and	these	are	by	far	the	 great 	 est 	 	 area 	 s 	 	of	the	earth	.
about	two	 third 	 s 	 	,	i	would	guess	,	of	the	world	is	 desert 	 ifying 	 	.
i	took	 th 	 is 	 	picture	in	the	tihamah	desert	while	25	 millimeter 	 s 	 	--	that	's	an	inch	of	rain	--	was	 fall 	 ing 	 	.
think	of	it	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 drum 	 s 	 	of	water	,	each	 contain 	 ing 	 	200	 liter 	 s 	 	.
over	1,000	 drum 	 s 	 	of	water	fell	on	every	hectare	of	that	land	that	day	.
the	next	day	,	the	land	 look 	 ed 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
where	had	that	water	gone	?
some	of	it	ran	off	 a 	 s 	 	 flood 	 ing 	 	,	but	most	of	the	water	that	 soak 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 s 	 oil 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	 evapo 	 rated 	 	out	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 exact 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	 do 	 es 	 	in	your	garden	if	you	 leav 	 e 	 	the	 s 	 oil 	 	 un 	 cover 	 ed 	 	.
now	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	fate	of	water	and	carbon	are	 ti 	 ed 	 	to	 s 	 oil 	 	 organ 	 ic 	 	matter	,	when	we	damage	 s 	 oil 	 s 	 	,	you	give	off	carbon	.
carbon	 go 	 es 	 	back	to	the	atmosphere	.
now	you	're	told	over	and	over	,	 repeat 	 ed 	 ly 	 	,	that	 desert 	 ification 	 	is	 on 	 ly 	 	 occur 	 ring 	 	in	 ari 	 d 	 	and	semi	-	 ari 	 d 	 	 area 	 s 	 	of	the	world	,	and	that	tall	 grass 	 land 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	one	in	high	 rain 	 fall 	 	are	of	no	 con 	 sequence 	 	.
but	if	you	do	not	look	at	 grass 	 land 	 s 	 	but	look	down	 in 	 to 	 	them	,	you	find	that	most	of	the	 s 	 oil 	 	in	that	 grass 	 land 	 	that	you	've	just	 s 	 een 	 	is	bare	and	 cover 	 ed 	 	with	a	crust	of	 al 	 ga 	 e 	 	,	 lead 	 ing 	 	to	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	 run 	 off 	 	and	 evapo 	 ration 	 	.
that	is	the	cancer	of	 desert 	 ification 	 	that	we	do	not	 recogn 	 ize 	 	till	 it 	 s 	 	terminal	form	.
now	we	know	that	 desert 	 ification 	 	is	 caus 	 ed 	 	by	 live 	 stock 	 	,	 most 	 ly 	 	cattle	,	sheep	and	 goat 	 s 	 	,	 over 	 grazing 	 	the	 plant 	 s 	 	,	 leav 	 ing 	 	the	 s 	 oil 	 	bare	and	giving	off	 m 	 ethane 	 	.
 al 	 most 	 	 every 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	from	 no 	 bel 	 	 laureate 	 s 	 	to	golf	 cad 	 dies 	 	,	or	was	taught	it	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	was	.
now	,	the	 environment 	 s 	 	like	you	see	here	,	 dust 	 y 	 	 environment 	 s 	 	in	africa	where	i	grew	up	,	and	i	 love 	 d 	 	 wild 	 life 	 	,	and	so	i	grew	up	 hat 	 ing 	 	 live 	 stock 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	damage	they	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	.
and	then	my	university	education	 a 	 s 	 	an	ecologist	 reinforce 	 d 	 	my	 belief 	 s 	 	.
well	,	i	have	news	for	you	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	once	just	 a 	 s 	 	certain	that	the	world	was	flat	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	wrong	then	,	and	we	are	wrong	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	i	want	to	 invit 	 e 	 	you	now	to	come	 a 	 long 	 	on	my	journey	of	 re 	 education 	 	and	 discover 	 y 	 	.
when	i	was	a	young	man	,	a	young	biologist	in	africa	,	i	was	 involve 	 d 	 	in	setting	 a 	 side 	 	 marvel 	 ous 	 	 area 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	future	national	 park 	 s 	 	.
now	no	 soon 	 er 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	was	in	the	1950s	--	and	no	 soon 	 er 	 	did	we	 re 	 move 	 	the	 hunt 	 ing 	 	,	drum	-	 beat 	 ing 	 	people	to	protect	the	 animal 	 s 	 	,	then	the	land	 beg 	 an 	 	to	 deterio 	 rate 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	see	in	 th 	 is 	 	park	that	we	 form 	 ed 	 	.
now	,	no	 live 	 stock 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	,	but	 suspect 	 ing 	 	that	we	had	too	 man 	 y 	 	 elephant 	 s 	 	now	,	i	did	the	research	and	i	 prov 	 ed 	 	we	had	too	 man 	 y 	 	,	and	i	 recommend 	 ed 	 	that	we	would	have	to	 reduc 	 e 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 number 	 s 	 	and	 br 	 ing 	 	them	down	to	a	level	that	the	land	could	sustain	.
now	,	that	was	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	decision	for	me	to	have	to	make	,	and	it	was	 politic 	 al 	 	 dynam 	 ite 	 	,	 frank 	 ly 	 	.
so	our	government	 form 	 ed 	 	a	team	of	 expert 	 s 	 	to	evaluate	my	research	.
they	did	.	they	 agree 	 d 	 	with	me	,	and	over	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	shot	40,000	 elephant 	 s 	 	to	try	to	stop	the	damage	.
and	it	got	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	not	better	.
loving	 elephant 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	i	do	,	that	was	the	 s 	 add 	 est 	 	and	 great 	 est 	 	 bl 	 under 	 	of	my	life	,	and	i	will	carry	that	to	my	grave	.
one	good	thing	did	come	out	of	it	.
it	made	me	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 determine 	 d 	 	to	devote	my	life	to	 find 	 ing 	 	 solution 	 s 	 	.
when	i	came	to	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	i	got	a	shock	,	to	find	national	 park 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	one	 desert 	 ifying 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 bad 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	in	africa	.
and	there	'd	 be 	 en 	 	no	 live 	 stock 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	land	for	over	70	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	i	found	that	american	 scientist 	 s 	 	had	no	 explan 	 ation 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	 ex 	 cept 	 	that	it	is	 ari 	 d 	 	and	natural	.
so	i	then	 beg 	 an 	 	looking	at	all	the	research	 plot 	 s 	 	i	could	over	the	whole	of	the	western	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	where	cattle	had	 be 	 en 	 	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	to	prove	that	it	would	stop	 desert 	 ification 	 	,	but	i	found	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	see	on	 th 	 is 	 	research	station	,	where	 th 	 is 	 	 grass 	 land 	 	that	was	green	in	1961	,	by	2002	had	 change 	 d 	 	to	that	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
and	the	 author 	 s 	 	of	the	position	paper	on	climate	change	from	which	i	 obtain 	 ed 	 	these	 picture 	 s 	 	 attribut 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	change	to	``	 un 	 known 	 	 process 	 es 	 	.	``
 clear 	 ly 	 	,	we	have	never	 under 	 stood 	 	what	is	 caus 	 ing 	 	 desert 	 ification 	 	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 destroy 	 ed 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	and	now	 threaten 	 s 	 	us	 global 	 ly 	 	.
we	have	never	 under 	 stood 	 	it	.
take	one	square	meter	of	 s 	 oil 	 	and	make	it	bare	like	 th 	 is 	 	is	down	here	,	and	i	promise	you	,	you	will	find	it	much	 cold 	 er 	 	at	dawn	and	much	 hot 	 ter 	 	at	 mid 	 day 	 	than	that	same	piece	of	ground	if	it	's	just	 cover 	 ed 	 	with	litter	,	plant	litter	.
you	have	 change 	 d 	 	the	 micro 	 climate 	 	.
now	,	by	the	time	you	are	 do 	 ing 	 	that	and	increasing	 great 	 ly 	 	the	 percent 	 age 	 	of	bare	ground	on	more	than	half	the	world	's	land	,	you	are	changing	 macro 	 climate 	 	.
but	we	have	just	 simpl 	 y 	 	not	 under 	 stood 	 	why	was	it	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	happen	10,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	?
why	 ha 	 s 	 	it	 accele 	 rated 	 	 late 	 ly 	 	?
we	had	no	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	that	.
what	we	had	 fail 	 ed 	 	to	understand	was	that	these	 season 	 al 	 	 hu 	 mid 	 ity 	 	 environment 	 s 	 	of	the	world	,	the	 s 	 oil 	 	and	the	 veget 	 ation 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	with	 ver 	 y 	 	large	 number 	 s 	 	of	grazing	 animal 	 s 	 	,	and	that	these	grazing	 animal 	 s 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	with	ferocious	pack	-	 hunt 	 ing 	 	 predator 	 s 	 	.
now	,	the	main	defense	against	pack	-	 hunt 	 ing 	 	 predator 	 s 	 	is	to	get	 in 	 to 	 	 herd 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 large 	 r 	 	the	herd	,	the	 safe 	 r 	 	the	 individual 	 s 	 	.
now	,	large	 herd 	 s 	 	dung	and	 urin 	 ate 	 	all	over	 the 	 ir 	 	own	food	,	and	they	have	to	keep	moving	,	and	it	was	that	 move 	 ment 	 	that	 prevent 	 ed 	 	the	 over 	 grazing 	 	of	 plant 	 s 	 	,	while	the	 period 	 ic 	 	 tramp 	 ling 	 	 ensure 	 d 	 	good	cover	of	the	 s 	 oil 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	see	where	a	herd	 ha 	 s 	 	 pass 	 ed 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	picture	is	a	typical	 season 	 al 	 	 grass 	 land 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	just	come	through	four	 month 	 s 	 	of	rain	,	and	it	's	now	going	 in 	 to 	 	eight	 month 	 s 	 	of	dry	season	.
and	watch	the	change	 a 	 s 	 	it	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	long	dry	season	.
now	,	all	of	that	grass	you	see	 above 	 ground 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	decay	 bio 	 logically 	 	before	the	next	growing	season	,	and	if	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	,	the	 grass 	 land 	 	and	the	 s 	 oil 	 	begin	to	die	.
now	,	if	it	 do 	 es 	 	not	decay	 bio 	 logically 	 	,	it	 shift 	 s 	 	to	 oxid 	 ation 	 	,	which	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 low 	 	process	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 mother 	 s 	 	and	 kill 	 s 	 	 grass 	 es 	 	,	 lead 	 ing 	 	to	a	shift	to	 wood 	 y 	 	 veget 	 ation 	 	and	bare	 s 	 oil 	 	,	 re 	 leas 	 ing 	 	carbon	.
to	prevent	that	,	we	have	 tradition 	 ally 	 	used	fire	.
but	fire	 al 	 so 	 	 leav 	 es 	 	the	 s 	 oil 	 	bare	,	 re 	 leas 	 ing 	 	carbon	,	and	 wo 	 rse 	 	than	that	,	 burn 	 ing 	 	one	hectare	of	 grass 	 land 	 	 give 	 s 	 	off	more	,	and	more	 dam 	 aging 	 	,	 pollutant 	 s 	 	than	6,000	 car 	 s 	 	.
and	we	are	 burn 	 ing 	 	in	africa	,	every	single	year	,	more	than	one	billion	 hectare 	 s 	 	of	 grass 	 land 	 s 	 	,	and	 al 	 most 	 	 no 	 body 	 	is	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	it	.
we	 just 	 ify 	 	the	 burn 	 ing 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 do 	 es 	 	 re 	 move 	 	the	dead	material	and	it	 allow 	 s 	 	the	 plant 	 s 	 	to	grow	.
now	,	looking	at	 th 	 is 	 	 grass 	 land 	 	of	 our 	 s 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	dry	,	what	could	we	do	to	keep	that	 health 	 y 	 	?
and	bear	in	mind	,	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	of	most	of	the	world	's	land	now	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?	we	can	not	 reduc 	 e 	 	animal	 number 	 s 	 	to	rest	it	more	 with 	 out 	 	 caus 	 ing 	 	 desert 	 ification 	 	and	climate	change	.
we	can	not	burn	it	 with 	 out 	 	 caus 	 ing 	 	 desert 	 ification 	 	and	climate	change	.
what	are	we	going	to	do	?
there	is	 on 	 ly 	 	one	option	,	i	'll	repeat	to	you	,	 on 	 ly 	 	one	option	left	to	 climato 	 logists 	 	and	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	and	that	is	to	do	the	 un 	 think 	 able 	 	,	and	to	use	 live 	 stock 	 	,	 bunch 	 ed 	 	and	moving	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 pr 	 oxy 	 	for	 form 	 er 	 	 herd 	 s 	 	and	 predator 	 s 	 	,	and	mimic	nature	.
there	is	no	other	 alter 	 native 	 	left	to	 man 	 kind 	 	.
so	let	's	do	that	.
so	on	 th 	 is 	 	bit	of	 grass 	 land 	 	,	we	'll	do	it	,	but	just	in	the	 fore 	 ground 	 	.
we	'll	impact	it	 ver 	 y 	 	 heav 	 ily 	 	with	cattle	to	mimic	nature	,	and	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	so	,	and	look	at	that	.
all	of	that	grass	is	now	 cover 	 ing 	 	the	 s 	 oil 	 	 a 	 s 	 	dung	,	 urin 	 e 	 	and	litter	or	mulch	,	 a 	 s 	 	every	one	of	the	 garden 	 ers 	 	 among 	 st 	 	you	would	understand	,	and	that	 s 	 oil 	 	is	ready	to	absorb	and	hold	the	rain	,	to	store	carbon	,	and	to	break	down	 m 	 ethane 	 	.
and	we	did	that	,	 with 	 out 	 	using	fire	to	damage	the	 s 	 oil 	 	,	and	the	 plant 	 s 	 	are	free	to	grow	.
when	i	first	 real 	 ized 	 	that	we	had	no	option	 a 	 s 	 	 scientist 	 s 	 	but	to	use	much	-	 vil 	 ified 	 	 live 	 stock 	 	to	address	climate	change	and	 desert 	 ification 	 	,	i	was	 face 	 d 	 	with	a	real	dilemma	.
how	 we 	 re 	 	we	to	do	it	?
we	'd	had	10,000	 year 	 s 	 	of	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 knowledge 	 able 	 	 pastor 	 alist 	 s 	 	 bunch 	 ing 	 	and	moving	 the 	 ir 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	,	but	they	had	 create 	 d 	 	the	great	 man 	 made 	 	 desert 	 s 	 	of	the	world	.
then	we	'd	had	100	 year 	 s 	 	of	modern	rain	science	,	and	that	had	 accele 	 rated 	 	 desert 	 ification 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	first	 discover 	 ed 	 	in	africa	and	then	 confirm 	 ed 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	you	see	in	 th 	 is 	 	picture	of	land	 manage 	 d 	 	by	the	federal	government	.
 clear 	 ly 	 	more	was	 need 	 ed 	 	than	 bunch 	 ing 	 	and	moving	the	 animal 	 s 	 	,	and	 human 	 s 	 	,	over	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	had	never	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	deal	with	nature	's	 complex 	 ity 	 	.
but	we	 biologist 	 s 	 	and	 ecologist 	 s 	 	had	never	 tackle 	 d 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	complex	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 re 	 invent 	 	the	wheel	,	i	 beg 	 an 	 	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	other	 profession 	 s 	 	to	see	if	 any 	 body 	 	had	.
and	i	found	there	 we 	 re 	 	 plan 	 ning 	 	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	that	i	could	take	and	adapt	to	our	 bio 	 logical 	 	need	,	and	from	 t 	 hose 	 	i	 develop 	 ed 	 	what	we	call	 hol 	 istic 	 	management	and	 plan 	 ned 	 	grazing	,	a	 plan 	 ning 	 	process	,	and	that	 do 	 es 	 	address	all	of	nature	's	 complex 	 ity 	 	and	our	social	,	 environment 	 al 	 	,	economic	 complex 	 ity 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	we	have	young	women	like	 th 	 is 	 	one	 teach 	 ing 	 	 village 	 s 	 	in	africa	how	to	put	 the 	 ir 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	together	 in 	 to 	 	 large 	 r 	 	 herd 	 s 	 	,	plan	 the 	 ir 	 	grazing	to	mimic	nature	,	and	where	we	have	them	hold	 the 	 ir 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	 over 	 night 	 	--	we	run	them	in	a	predator	-	friendly	manner	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	a	lot	of	 land 	 s 	 	,	and	so	on	--	and	where	they	do	 th 	 is 	 	and	hold	them	 over 	 night 	 	to	 prep 	 are 	 	the	crop	 field 	 s 	 	,	we	are	 get 	 ting 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	great	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	in	crop	yield	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
let	's	look	at	some	 result 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	land	close	to	land	that	we	manage	in	zimbabwe	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	just	come	through	four	 month 	 s 	 	of	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 rain 	 s 	 	it	got	that	year	,	and	it	's	going	 in 	 to 	 	the	long	dry	season	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	all	of	that	rain	,	 al 	 most 	 	of	all	it	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 evapo 	 rated 	 	from	the	 s 	 oil 	 	surface	.
 the 	 ir 	 	river	is	dry	 de 	 spite 	 	the	rain	just	 hav 	 ing 	 	 end 	 ed 	 	,	and	we	have	150,000	people	on	 al 	 most 	 	permanent	food	aid	.
now	let	's	go	to	our	land	 near 	 by 	 	on	the	same	day	,	with	the	same	 rain 	 fall 	 	,	and	look	at	that	.
our	river	is	 flow 	 ing 	 	and	 health 	 y 	 	and	clean	.
it	's	fine	.
the	production	of	grass	,	 shrub 	 s 	 	,	 tree 	 s 	 	,	 wild 	 life 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	is	now	more	productive	,	and	we	have	 virtual 	 ly 	 	no	fear	of	dry	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	we	did	that	by	increasing	the	cattle	and	 goat 	 s 	 	400	percent	,	 plan 	 ning 	 	the	grazing	to	mimic	nature	and	integrate	them	with	all	the	 elephant 	 s 	 	,	buffalo	,	giraffe	and	other	 animal 	 s 	 	that	we	have	.
but	before	we	 beg 	 an 	 	,	our	land	 look 	 ed 	 	like	that	.
 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	was	bare	and	 ero 	 d 	 ing 	 	for	over	30	 year 	 s 	 	 regard 	 less 	 	of	what	rain	we	got	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?	watch	the	 mark 	 ed 	 	tree	and	see	the	change	 a 	 s 	 	we	use	 live 	 stock 	 	to	mimic	nature	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	 an 	 other 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	where	it	had	 be 	 en 	 	bare	and	 ero 	 d 	 ing 	 	,	and	at	the	base	of	the	 mark 	 ed 	 	small	tree	,	we	had	lost	over	30	 centimeter 	 s 	 	of	 s 	 oil 	 	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	watch	the	change	just	using	 live 	 stock 	 	to	mimic	nature	.
and	there	are	 fall 	 en 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	in	there	now	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	better	land	is	now	 attract 	 ing 	 	 elephant 	 s 	 	,	etc	.
 th 	 is 	 	land	in	mexico	was	in	 terr 	 ible 	 	condition	,	and	i	've	had	to	mark	the	hill	 be 	 cause 	 	the	change	is	so	 pro 	 found 	 	.
i	 beg 	 an 	 	 help 	 ing 	 	a	family	in	the	karoo	desert	in	the	1970s	turn	the	desert	that	you	see	on	the	right	there	back	to	 grass 	 land 	 	,	and	 thank 	 fully 	 	,	now	 the 	 ir 	 	 grand 	 children 	 	are	on	the	land	with	hope	for	the	future	.
and	look	at	the	 amaz 	 ing 	 	change	in	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	where	that	 gull 	 y 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	 heal 	 ed 	 	using	 noth 	 ing 	 	but	 live 	 stock 	 	 mimic 	 king 	 	nature	,	and	once	more	,	we	have	the	third	generation	of	that	family	on	that	land	with	 the 	 ir 	 	flag	still	 fly 	 ing 	 	.
the	vast	 grass 	 land 	 s 	 	of	patagonia	are	 turn 	 ing 	 	to	desert	 a 	 s 	 	you	see	here	.
the	man	in	the	middle	is	an	argentinian	 research 	 er 	 	,	and	he	 ha 	 s 	 	 document 	 ed 	 	the	 stead 	 y 	 	decline	of	that	land	over	the	 year 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	 ke 	 pt 	 	 reduc 	 ing 	 	sheep	 number 	 s 	 	.
they	put	25,000	sheep	in	one	flock	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 mimic 	 king 	 	nature	now	with	 plan 	 ned 	 	grazing	,	and	they	have	 document 	 ed 	 	a	50	-	percent	 in 	 crease 	 	in	the	production	of	the	land	in	the	first	year	.
we	now	have	in	the	violent	horn	of	africa	 pastor 	 alist 	 s 	 	 plan 	 ning 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	grazing	to	mimic	nature	and	 open 	 ly 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	it	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	hope	they	have	of	saving	 the 	 ir 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	and	saving	 the 	 ir 	 	culture	.
ninety	-	five	percent	of	that	land	can	 on 	 ly 	 	feed	people	from	 animal 	 s 	 	.
i	 re 	 mind 	 	you	that	i	am	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	most	of	the	world	's	land	here	that	 control 	 s 	 	our	fate	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	the	most	violent	region	of	the	world	,	where	 on 	 ly 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	can	feed	people	from	about	95	percent	of	the	land	.
what	we	are	 do 	 ing 	 	 global 	 ly 	 	is	 caus 	 ing 	 	climate	change	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	fossil	 fuel 	 s 	 	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	more	than	fossil	 fuel 	 s 	 	.
but	 wo 	 rse 	 	than	that	,	it	is	 caus 	 ing 	 	 hung 	 er 	 	,	poverty	,	violence	,	social	 break 	 down 	 	and	war	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	i	am	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	you	,	 million 	 s 	 	of	men	,	women	and	children	are	 suffer 	 ing 	 	and	 dy 	 ing 	 	.
and	if	 th 	 is 	 	 continu 	 es 	 	,	we	are	 un 	 like 	 ly 	 	to	be	able	to	stop	the	climate	changing	,	even	after	we	have	 eliminate 	 d 	 	the	use	of	fossil	 fuel 	 s 	 	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	i	've	 show 	 n 	 	you	how	we	can	work	with	nature	at	 ver 	 y 	 	low	cost	to	reverse	all	 th 	 is 	 	.
we	are	 al 	 ready 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	so	on	about	15	million	 hectare 	 s 	 	on	five	 continent 	 s 	 	,	and	people	who	understand	far	more	about	carbon	than	i	do	 calcul 	 ate 	 	that	,	for	 illustr 	 ative 	 	 purpose 	 s 	 	,	if	we	do	what	i	am	 show 	 ing 	 	you	here	,	we	can	take	 en 	 ough 	 	carbon	out	of	the	atmosphere	and	 safe 	 ly 	 	store	it	in	the	 grass 	 land 	 	 s 	 oil 	 s 	 	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	if	we	just	do	that	on	about	half	the	world	's	 grass 	 land 	 s 	 	that	i	've	 show 	 n 	 	you	,	we	can	take	us	back	to	pre	-	industrial	 level 	 s 	 	,	while	 feed 	 ing 	 	people	.
i	can	think	of	 al 	 most 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	that	 off 	 ers 	 	more	hope	for	our	planet	,	for	your	children	,	and	 the 	 ir 	 	children	,	and	all	of	 human 	 ity 	 	.
thank	you	.

chris	anderson	:	thank	you	.	i	have	,	and	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	 every 	 one 	 	here	 ha 	 s 	 	,	a	)	a	hundred	 question 	 s 	 	,	b	)	 want 	 s 	 	to	hug	you	.
i	'm	just	going	to	ask	you	one	quick	question	.
when	you	first	start	 th 	 is 	 	and	you	 br 	 ing 	 	in	a	flock	of	 animal 	 s 	 	,	it	's	desert	.	what	do	they	eat	?	how	 do 	 es 	 	that	part	work	?
how	do	you	start	?
allan	 savor 	 y 	 	:	well	,	we	have	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	for	a	long	time	,	and	the	 on 	 ly 	 	time	we	have	ever	had	to	provide	any	feed	is	 dur 	 ing 	 	mine	 re 	 clam 	 ation 	 	,	where	it	's	100	percent	bare	.
but	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	we	took	the	worst	land	in	zimbabwe	,	where	i	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	a	gbp	5	note	in	a	hundred	-	mile	drive	if	 some 	 body 	 	could	find	one	grass	in	a	hundred	-	mile	drive	,	and	on	that	,	we	 treble 	 d 	 	the	 stock 	 ing 	 	rate	,	the	number	of	 animal 	 s 	 	,	in	the	first	year	with	no	 feed 	 ing 	 	,	just	by	the	 move 	 ment 	 	,	 mimic 	 king 	 	nature	,	and	using	a	sigmoid	 curv 	 e 	 	,	that	principle	.
it	's	a	little	bit	technical	to	explain	here	,	but	just	that	.
ca	:	well	,	i	would	love	to	--	i	mean	,	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	and	 import 	 ant 	 	idea	.
the	best	people	on	our	blog	are	going	to	come	and	talk	to	you	and	try	and	--	i	want	to	get	more	on	 th 	 is 	 	that	we	could	share	 a 	 long 	 	with	the	talk	.	 a 	 s 	 	:	 wonder 	 ful 	 	.
ca	:	that	is	an	 astonish 	 ing 	 	talk	,	 tru 	 ly 	 	an	 astonish 	 ing 	 	talk	,	and	i	think	you	heard	that	we	all	are	 cheer 	 ing 	 	you	on	your	way	.
thank	you	so	much	.	 a 	 s 	 	:	well	,	thank	you	.	thank	you	.	thank	you	,	chris	.
