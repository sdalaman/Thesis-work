i	'm	going	to	tell	you	about	an	 affli 	 ction 	 	i	suffer	from	.
and	i	have	a	funny	 feel 	 ing 	 	that	 quit 	 e 	 	a	few	of	you	suffer	from	it	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
when	i	'm	 walk 	 ing 	 	around	an	art	 gall 	 ery 	 	,	rooms	and	rooms	full	of	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	after	about	15	or	20	 minute 	 s 	 	,	i	 real 	 ize 	 	i	'm	not	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	not	 connect 	 ing 	 	to	them	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	i	'm	 think 	 ing 	 	about	that	cup	of	coffee	i	 desperate 	 ly 	 	need	to	wake	me	up	.
i	'm	 suffer 	 ing 	 	from	 gall 	 ery 	 	fatigue	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	out	there	suffer	from	--	 y 	 es 	 	.	ha	ha	,	ha	ha	!
now	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	you	might	last	 long 	 er 	 	than	20	 minute 	 s 	 	,	or	even	 short 	 er 	 	,	but	i	think	we	all	suffer	from	it	.	and	do	you	have	the	 ac 	 company 	 ing 	 	guilt	?
for	me	,	i	look	at	the	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	on	the	wall	and	i	think	,	 some 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	to	put	them	there	,	 think 	 s 	 	they	're	good	 en 	 ough 	 	to	be	on	that	wall	,	but	i	do	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	see	it	.
in	fact	,	most	of	the	time	i	do	n't	see	it	.
and	i	 leav 	 e 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 un 	 happy 	 	.
i	feel	 guilt 	 y 	 	and	 un 	 happy 	 	with	 my 	 self 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 think 	 ing 	 	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	wrong	with	the	 paint 	 ing 	 	,	i	think	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	wrong	with	me	.
and	that	's	not	a	good	experience	,	to	 leav 	 e 	 	a	 gall 	 ery 	 	like	that	.
the	thing	is	,	i	think	we	should	give	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	a	break	.
if	you	think	about	going	 in 	 to 	 	a	restaurant	,	when	you	look	at	the	menu	,	are	you	 expect 	 ed 	 	to	order	every	single	thing	on	the	menu	?
no	!	you	select	.
if	you	go	 in 	 to 	 	a	 depart 	 ment 	 	store	to	buy	a	shirt	,	are	you	going	to	try	on	every	single	shirt	and	want	every	single	shirt	?
of	course	not	,	you	can	be	 select 	 ive 	 	.	it	's	 expect 	 ed 	 	.
how	come	,	then	,	it	's	not	so	 expect 	 ed 	 	to	be	 select 	 ive 	 	when	we	go	to	an	art	 gall 	 ery 	 	?
why	are	we	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	have	a	 connect 	 ion 	 	with	every	single	 paint 	 ing 	 	?
well	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	take	a	different	approach	.
and	there	's	two	 thing 	 s 	 	i	do	:	when	i	go	 in 	 to 	 	a	 gall 	 ery 	 	,	first	of	all	,	i	go	 quit 	 e 	 	fast	,	and	i	look	at	 every 	 thing 	 	,	and	i	 pin 	 point 	 	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	make	me	 s 	 low 	 	down	for	some	reason	or	other	.
i	do	n't	even	know	why	they	make	me	 s 	 low 	 	down	,	but	 some 	 thing 	 	 pull 	 s 	 	me	like	a	magnet	and	then	i	 ignor 	 e 	 	all	the	 other 	 s 	 	,	and	i	just	go	to	that	 paint 	 ing 	 	.
so	it	's	the	first	thing	i	do	is	,	i	do	my	own	 cur 	 ation 	 	.
i	 choos 	 e 	 	a	 paint 	 ing 	 	.	it	might	just	be	one	 paint 	 ing 	 	in	50	.
and	then	the	second	thing	i	do	is	i	stand	in	front	of	that	 paint 	 ing 	 	,	and	i	tell	 my 	 self 	 	a	story	about	it	.
why	a	story	?	well	,	i	think	that	we	are	wired	,	our	dna	 tell 	 s 	 	us	to	tell	 st 	 ories 	 	.
we	tell	 st 	 ories 	 	all	the	time	about	 every 	 thing 	 	,	and	i	think	we	do	it	 be 	 cause 	 	the	world	is	kind	of	a	crazy	,	chaotic	place	,	and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	,	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	sense	of	the	world	a	little	bit	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	some	order	to	it	.
why	not	 app 	 ly 	 	that	to	our	looking	at	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	?
so	i	now	have	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	restaurant	menu	 visit 	 ing 	 	of	art	 gall 	 eries 	 	.
there	are	three	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	i	'm	going	to	show	you	now
that	are	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	that	made	me	stop	in	my	 track 	 s 	 	and	want	to	tell	 st 	 ories 	 	about	them	.
the	first	one	 need 	 s 	 	little	 introduc 	 tion 	 	--	``	girl	with	a	pearl	 ear 	 ring 	 	``	by	johannes	vermeer	,	17th	-	century	dutch	 paint 	 er 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	most	 glor 	 ious 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 	.
i	first	saw	it	when	i	was	19	,	and	i	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	went	out	and	got	a	 post 	 er 	 	of	it	,	and	in	fact	i	still	have	that	 post 	 er 	 	.	30	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	it	's	 hang 	 ing 	 	in	my	house	.
it	's	 accompani 	 ed 	 	me	 every 	 where 	 	i	've	gone	,	i	never	tire	of	looking	at	her	.
what	made	me	stop	in	my	 track 	 s 	 	about	her	to	begin	with	was	just	the	 gorge 	 ous 	 	 color 	 s 	 	he	uses	and	the	light	 fall 	 ing 	 	on	her	face	.
but	i	think	what	's	 ke 	 pt 	 	me	still	coming	back	year	after	year	is	 an 	 other 	 	thing	,	and	that	is	the	look	on	her	face	,	the	 conflict 	 ed 	 	look	on	her	face	.
i	ca	n't	tell	if	she	's	happy	or	 s 	 ad 	 	,	and	i	change	my	mind	all	the	time	.
so	that	 keep 	 s 	 	me	coming	back	.
one	day	,	16	 year 	 s 	 	after	i	had	 th 	 is 	 	 post 	 er 	 	on	my	wall	,	i	lay	in	bed	and	 look 	 ed 	 	at	her	,	and	i	 sudden 	 ly 	 	thought	,	i	wonder	what	the	 paint 	 er 	 	did	to	her	to	make	her	look	like	that	.
and	it	was	the	first	time	i	'd	ever	thought	that	the	 express 	 ion 	 	on	her	face	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 reflect 	 ing 	 	how	she	 feel 	 s 	 	about	him	.
 al 	 ways 	 	before	i	'd	thought	of	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	portrait	of	a	girl	.
now	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	think	of	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	portrait	of	a	relationship	.
and	i	thought	,	well	,	what	is	that	relationship	?
so	i	went	to	find	out	.	i	did	some	research	and	 discover 	 ed 	 	,	we	have	no	idea	who	she	is	.
in	fact	,	we	do	n't	know	who	any	of	the	 model 	 s 	 	in	any	of	vermeer	's	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	are	,	and	we	know	 ver 	 y 	 	little	about	vermeer	 him 	 self 	 	.
which	made	me	go	,	``	yippee	!	``	i	can	do	 what 	 ever 	 	i	want	,	i	can	come	up	with	 what 	 ever 	 	story	i	want	to	.
so	here	's	how	i	came	up	with	the	story	.
first	of	all	,	i	thought	,	i	've	got	to	get	her	 in 	 to 	 	the	house	.
how	 do 	 es 	 	vermeer	know	her	?
well	,	there	've	 be 	 en 	 	 suggest 	 ions 	 	that	she	is	his	12	-	year	-	old	daughter	.
the	daughter	at	the	time	was	12	when	he	 paint 	 ed 	 	the	 paint 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	thought	,	no	,	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 intima 	 te 	 	look	,	but	it	's	not	a	look	a	daughter	 give 	 s 	 	her	father	.
for	one	thing	,	in	dutch	 paint 	 ing 	 	of	the	time	,	if	a	woman	's	mouth	was	open	,	it	was	 indic 	 ating 	 	sexual	 avail 	 ability 	 	.
it	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	 in 	 appropriate 	 	for	vermeer	to	paint	his	daughter	like	that	.
so	it	's	not	his	daughter	,	but	it	's	 some 	 body 	 	close	to	him	,	 physical 	 ly 	 	close	to	him	.
well	,	who	else	would	be	in	the	house	?
a	 serv 	 ant 	 	,	a	 love 	 ly 	 	 serv 	 ant 	 	.
so	,	she	's	in	the	house	.
how	do	we	get	her	 in 	 to 	 	the	studio	?
we	do	n't	know	 ver 	 y 	 	much	about	vermeer	,	but	the	little	bits	that	we	do	know	,	one	thing	we	know	is	that	he	married	a	catholic	woman	,	they	lived	with	her	mother	in	a	house	where	he	had	his	own	room	where	he	--	his	studio	.	he	 al 	 so 	 	had	11	children	.
it	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	a	chaotic	,	noisy	 house 	 hold 	 	.
and	if	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	vermeer	's	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	before	,	you	know	that	they	're	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	calm	and	quiet	.
how	 do 	 es 	 	a	 paint 	 er 	 	paint	 s 	 uch 	 	calm	,	quiet	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	with	11	 kid 	 s 	 	around	?
well	,	he	 compartment 	 al 	 ize 	 s 	 	his	life	.
he	 get 	 s 	 	to	his	studio	,	and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 no 	 body 	 	 come 	 s 	 	in	here	.
not	the	wife	,	not	the	 kid 	 s 	 	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	the	maid	can	come	in	and	clean	.	``	she	's	in	the	studio	.	he	's	got	her	in	the	studio	,	they	're	together	.
and	he	 decide 	 s 	 	to	paint	her	.
he	 ha 	 s 	 	her	wear	 ver 	 y 	 	plain	 clothe 	 s 	 	.
now	,	all	of	the	women	,	or	most	of	the	women	in	vermeer	's	other	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	 wo 	 re 	 	 vel 	 vet 	 	,	silk	,	fur	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 sum 	 pt 	 uous 	 	 material 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	plain	;	the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	that	is	n't	plain	is	her	pearl	 ear 	 ring 	 	.
now	,	if	she	's	a	 serv 	 ant 	 	,	there	is	no	way	she	could	afford	a	pair	of	pearl	 ear 	 ring 	 s 	 	.
so	 t 	 hose 	 	are	not	her	pearl	 ear 	 ring 	 s 	 	.	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	are	they	?
we	happen	to	know	,	there	's	a	list	of	catharina	,	the	wife	's	 clothe 	 s 	 	.
 among 	 st 	 	them	a	yellow	coat	with	white	fur	,	a	yellow	and	black	 bod 	 ice 	 	,	and	you	see	these	 clothe 	 s 	 	on	 lot 	 s 	 	of	other	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	different	women	in	the	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	vermeer	's	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
so	 clear 	 ly 	 	,	her	 clothe 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	lent	to	 vari 	 ous 	 	different	women	.
it	's	not	 s 	 uch 	 	a	leap	of	faith	to	take	that	that	pearl	 ear 	 ring 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 belong 	 s 	 	to	his	wife	.
so	we	've	got	all	the	 element 	 s 	 	for	our	story	.
she	's	in	the	studio	with	him	for	a	long	time	.
these	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	took	a	long	time	to	make	.
they	would	have	 s 	 pent 	 	the	time	 al 	 one 	 	,	all	that	time	.
she	's	 wear 	 ing 	 	his	wife	's	pearl	 ear 	 ring 	 	.
she	's	 gorge 	 ous 	 	.	she	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 love 	 s 	 	him	.	she	's	 conflict 	 ed 	 	.
and	 do 	 es 	 	the	wife	know	?	 may 	 be 	 	not	.
and	if	she	 do 	 es 	 	n't	,	well	--	that	's	the	story	.
the	next	 paint 	 ing 	 	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	boy	building	a	house	of	 card 	 s 	 	``	by	chardin	.
he	's	an	18th	-	century	french	 paint 	 er 	 	best	known	for	his	still	 life 	 s 	 	,	but	he	did	 occasion 	 ally 	 	paint	people	.
and	in	fact	,	he	 paint 	 ed 	 	four	 version 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 	,	different	 boy 	 s 	 	building	 house 	 s 	 	of	 card 	 s 	 	,	all	 concent 	 rated 	 	.
i	like	 th 	 is 	 	version	the	best	,	 be 	 cause 	 	some	of	the	 boy 	 s 	 	are	 old 	 er 	 	and	some	are	 young 	 er 	 	,	and	to	me	,	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	like	goldilocks	's	 por 	 ridge 	 	,	is	just	right	.
he	's	not	 quit 	 e 	 	a	child	,	and	he	's	not	 quit 	 e 	 	a	man	.
he	's	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 balanc 	 ed 	 	between	 innoc 	 ence 	 	and	experience	,	and	that	made	me	stop	in	my	 track 	 s 	 	in	front	of	 th 	 is 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	his	face	.	it	's	like	a	vermeer	 paint 	 ing 	 	a	bit	.
the	light	 come 	 s 	 	in	from	the	left	,	his	face	is	 bath 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 glow 	 ing 	 	light	.	it	's	right	in	the	center	of	the	 paint 	 ing 	 	,	and	you	look	at	it	,	and	i	found	that	when	i	was	looking	at	it	,	i	was	 stand 	 ing 	 	there	going	,	``	look	at	me	.	 pleas 	 e 	 	look	at	me	.	``	and	he	did	n't	look	at	me	.	he	was	still	looking	at	his	 card 	 s 	 	,	and	that	's	one	of	the	 s 	 e 	 duct 	 ive 	 	 element 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 	is	,	he	's	so	focused	on	what	he	's	 do 	 ing 	 	that	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	look	at	us	.
and	that	is	,	to	me	,	the	sign	of	a	 master 	 piece 	 	,	of	a	 paint 	 ing 	 	when	there	's	a	lack	of	 re 	 solution 	 	.
he	's	never	going	to	look	at	me	.
so	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	of	a	story	where	,	if	i	'm	in	 th 	 is 	 	position	,	who	could	be	there	looking	at	him	?
not	the	 paint 	 er 	 	,	i	do	n't	want	to	think	about	the	 paint 	 er 	 	.
i	'm	 think 	 ing 	 	of	an	 old 	 er 	 	version	of	 him 	 self 	 	.
he	's	a	man	,	a	 serv 	 ant 	 	,	an	 old 	 er 	 	 serv 	 ant 	 	looking	at	 th 	 is 	 	 young 	 er 	 	 serv 	 ant 	 	,	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	look	at	me	.	i	want	to	 war 	 n 	 	you	about	what	you	're	about	to	go	through	.	 pleas 	 e 	 	look	at	me	.	``	and	he	never	 do 	 es 	 	.
and	that	lack	of	 re 	 solution 	 	,	the	lack	of	 re 	 solution 	 	in	``	girl	with	a	pearl	 ear 	 ring 	 	``	--	we	do	n't	know	if	she	's	happy	or	 s 	 ad 	 	.
i	've	written	an	entire	novel	about	her	,	and	i	still	do	n't	know	if	she	's	happy	or	 s 	 ad 	 	.
 aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	back	to	the	 paint 	 ing 	 	,	looking	for	the	answer	,	looking	for	the	story	to	fill	in	that	gap	.
and	we	may	make	a	story	,	and	it	 sati 	 s 	 fi 	 es 	 	us	 moment 	 arily 	 	,	but	not	 re 	 ally 	 	,	and	we	come	back	 aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	.
the	last	 paint 	 ing 	 	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 anonym 	 ous 	 	``	by	 anonym 	 ous 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	tudor	portrait	 b 	 ought 	 	by	the	national	portrait	 gall 	 ery 	 	.
they	thought	it	was	a	man	named	 s 	 ir 	 	thomas	overbury	,	and	then	they	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	it	was	n't	him	,	and	they	have	no	idea	who	it	is	.
now	,	in	the	national	portrait	 gall 	 ery 	 	,	if	you	do	n't	know	the	 bio 	 graphy 	 	of	the	 paint 	 ing 	 	,	it	's	kind	of	 use 	 less 	 	to	you	.
they	ca	n't	hang	it	on	the	wall	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	do	n't	know	who	he	is	.
so	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	orphan	 s 	 pend 	 s 	 	most	of	his	time	in	 s 	 to 	 rage 	 	,	 a 	 long 	 	with	 quit 	 e 	 	a	number	of	other	 orphan 	 s 	 	,	some	of	them	some	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 	made	me	stop	in	my	 track 	 s 	 	for	three	 reason 	 s 	 	:
one	is	the	 dis 	 connect 	 ion 	 	between	his	mouth	that	's	 smil 	 ing 	 	and	his	 eye 	 s 	 	that	are	 wist 	 ful 	 	.
he	's	not	happy	,	and	why	is	n't	he	happy	?
the	second	thing	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 attract 	 ed 	 	me	 we 	 re 	 	his	bright	red	 cheek 	 s 	 	.
he	is	 blush 	 ing 	 	.	he	's	 blush 	 ing 	 	for	his	portrait	 be 	 ing 	 	made	!
 th 	 is 	 	must	be	a	guy	who	 blush 	 es 	 	all	the	time	.
what	is	he	 think 	 ing 	 	about	that	's	making	him	blush	?
the	third	thing	that	made	me	stop	in	my	 track 	 s 	 	is	his	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 gorge 	 ous 	 	 double 	 t 	 	.	silk	,	gray	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 button 	 s 	 	.
and	you	know	what	it	 make 	 s 	 	me	think	of	,	is	it	's	sort	of	snug	and	 puff 	 y 	 	;	it	's	like	a	 du 	 vet 	 	spread	over	a	bed	.
i	 ke 	 pt 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	of	 bed 	 s 	 	and	red	 cheek 	 s 	 	,	and	of	course	i	 ke 	 pt 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	of	 s 	 ex 	 	when	i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	him	,	and	i	thought	,	is	that	what	he	's	 think 	 ing 	 	about	?
and	i	thought	,	if	i	'm	going	to	make	a	story	,	what	's	the	last	thing	i	'm	going	to	put	in	there	?
well	,	what	would	a	tudor	 gentle 	 man 	 	be	 pre 	 occupied 	 	with	?
and	i	thought	,	well	,	henry	viii	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
he	'd	be	 pre 	 occupied 	 	with	his	 inherit 	 ance 	 	,	with	his	heir	.
who	is	going	to	inherit	his	name	and	his	fortune	?
you	put	all	 t 	 hose 	 	together	,	and	you	've	got	your	story	to	fill	in	that	gap	that	 make 	 s 	 	you	keep	coming	back	.
now	,	here	's	the	story	.
it	's	short	.
``	 ros 	 y 	 	``	i	am	still	 wear 	 ing 	 	the	white	 broc 	 ade 	 	 double 	 t 	 	caroline	 g 	 ave 	 	me	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	plain	high	collar	,	 detach 	 able 	 	 sleeve 	 s 	 	and	 intric 	 ate 	 	 button 	 s 	 	of	 twist 	 ed 	 	silk	 th 	 read 	 	,	set	close	together	so	that	the	fit	is	snug	.
the	 double 	 t 	 	 make 	 s 	 	me	think	of	a	 cover 	 let 	 	on	the	vast	bed	.
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	that	was	the	 intent 	 ion 	 	.
