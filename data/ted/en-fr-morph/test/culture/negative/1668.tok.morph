but	 th 	 is 	 	is	different	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	coming	from	the	heart	of	finance	.
the	first	quote	is	from	jean	-	claude	trichet	when	he	was	 govern 	 or 	 	of	the	european	central	bank	.
the	second	quote	is	from	the	head	of	the	u.k.	financial	 service 	 s 	 	 author 	 ity 	 	.
are	these	people	implying	that	we	do	n't	understand	the	economic	 system 	 s 	 	that	drive	our	modern	 socie 	 ties 	 	?
it	 get 	 s 	 	 wo 	 rse 	 	.
``	we	 s 	 pend 	 	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	the	 origin 	 s 	 	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	while	we	still	do	n't	understand	the	 condition 	 s 	 	for	a	 s 	 table 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	a	 function 	 ing 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	or	peace	.	``	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	here	?	how	can	 th 	 is 	 	be	possible	?

 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	the	answer	is	 y 	 es 	 	.
but	there	's	an	 intrigu 	 ing 	 	solution	which	is	coming	from	what	is	known	 a 	 s 	 	the	science	of	 complex 	 ity 	 	.
to	explain	what	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	and	what	 th 	 is 	 	thing	is	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	let	me	 quick 	 ly 	 	take	a	couple	of	 step 	 s 	 	back	.
i	 end 	 ed 	 	up	in	physics	by	accident	.
it	was	a	random	 en 	 counter 	 	when	i	was	young	,	and	since	then	,	i	've	often	 wonder 	 ed 	 	about	the	 amaz 	 ing 	 	success	of	physics	in	 de 	 s 	 crib 	 ing 	 	the	 re 	 ality 	 	we	wake	up	in	every	day	.
in	a	 nut 	 shell 	 	,	you	can	think	of	physics	 a 	 s 	 	 follow 	 s 	 	.	so	you	take	a	chunk	of	 re 	 ality 	 	you	want	to	understand	and	you	 transl 	 ate 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	 mathematic 	 s 	 	.
you	encode	it	 in 	 to 	 	 equ 	 ations 	 	.
then	 predict 	 ions 	 	can	be	made	and	tested	.
we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	 work 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	no	one	 re 	 ally 	 	 know 	 s 	 	why	the	 thought 	 s 	 	in	our	 head 	 s 	 	should	 actual 	 ly 	 	 re 	 late 	 	to	the	fundamental	 work 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
 de 	 spite 	 	the	success	,	physics	 ha 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 limit 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	dirk	helbing	 point 	 ed 	 	out	in	the	last	quote	,	we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	understand	the	 complex 	 ity 	 	that	 relat 	 es 	 	to	us	,	that	 surround 	 s 	 	us	.
 th 	 is 	 	paradox	is	what	got	me	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	complex	 system 	 s 	 	.
so	these	are	 system 	 s 	 	which	are	made	up	of	 man 	 y 	 	 interconnect 	 ed 	 	or	 interact 	 ing 	 	 part 	 s 	 	:	 s 	 warm 	 s 	 	of	 bird 	 s 	 	or	fish	,	ant	 colon 	 ies 	 	,	 eco 	 system 	 s 	 	,	 brain 	 s 	 	,	financial	 market 	 s 	 	.
these	are	just	a	few	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	complex	 system 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	map	 in 	 to 	 	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 equ 	 ations 	 	,	so	the	usual	physics	approach	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	work	here	.
so	what	do	we	know	about	complex	 system 	 s 	 	?
well	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	what	 look 	 s 	 	like	complex	behavior	from	the	 out 	 side 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	result	of	a	few	simple	 rule 	 s 	 	of	 interact 	 ion 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	you	can	forget	about	the	 equ 	 ations 	 	and	just	start	to	understand	the	system	by	looking	at	the	 interact 	 ions 	 	,	so	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	forget	about	the	 equ 	 ations 	 	and	you	just	start	to	look	at	the	 interact 	 ions 	 	.
and	it	 get 	 s 	 	even	better	,	 be 	 cause 	 	most	complex	 system 	 s 	 	have	 th 	 is 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 proper 	 ty 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	emergence	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	the	system	 a 	 s 	 	a	whole	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 start 	 s 	 	to	show	a	behavior	which	can	not	be	 under 	 stood 	 	or	 predict 	 ed 	 	by	looking	at	the	 component 	 s 	 	of	the	system	.
so	the	whole	is	 liter 	 ally 	 	more	than	the	sum	of	 it 	 s 	 	 part 	 s 	 	.
and	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	you	can	forget	about	the	individual	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	system	,	how	complex	they	are	.
so	if	it	's	a	cell	or	a	 ter 	 mite 	 	or	a	bird	,	you	just	focus	on	the	 rule 	 s 	 	of	 interact 	 ion 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	result	,	 network 	 s 	 	are	ideal	 represent 	 ations 	 	of	complex	 system 	 s 	 	.
the	 nod 	 es 	 	in	the	network	are	the	system	's	 component 	 s 	 	and	the	 link 	 s 	 	are	 give 	 n 	 	by	the	 interact 	 ions 	 	.
so	what	 equ 	 ations 	 	are	for	physics	,	complex	 network 	 s 	 	are	for	the	 stud 	 y 	 	of	complex	 system 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	approach	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 success 	 fully 	 	 appli 	 ed 	 	to	 man 	 y 	 	complex	 system 	 s 	 	in	physics	,	biology	,	computer	science	,	the	social	 science 	 s 	 	,	but	what	about	 economic 	 s 	 	?
where	are	economic	 network 	 s 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	surprising	and	prominent	gap	in	the	 liter 	 ature 	 	.
the	 stud 	 y 	 	we	 publish 	 ed 	 	last	year	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	network	of	global	corporate	control	``	was	the	first	 extens 	 ive 	 	analysis	of	economic	 network 	 s 	 	.
the	 stud 	 y 	 	went	viral	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	and	it	 attract 	 ed 	 	a	lot	of	attention	from	the	 inter 	 national 	 	media	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 quit 	 e 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	why	did	no	one	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	before	?
similar	data	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	around	for	 quit 	 e 	 	some	time	.
what	we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	in	detail	was	 owner 	 ship 	 	 network 	 s 	 	.
so	here	the	 nod 	 es 	 	are	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	,	people	,	 government 	 s 	 	,	 found 	 ations 	 	,	etc	.
and	the	 link 	 s 	 	represent	the	shareholding	 relation 	 s 	 	,	so	 share 	 holder 	 	a	 ha 	 s 	 	x	percent	of	the	 share 	 s 	 	in	company	b	.
and	we	 al 	 so 	 	assign	a	value	to	the	company	 give 	 n 	 	by	the	 oper 	 ating 	 	revenue	.
so	 owner 	 ship 	 	 network 	 s 	 	reveal	the	 pattern 	 s 	 	of	shareholding	 relation 	 s 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	little	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	you	can	see	a	few	financial	 institution 	 s 	 	with	some	of	the	 man 	 y 	 	 link 	 s 	 	 high 	 light 	 ed 	 	.
now	you	may	think	that	no	one	's	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	before	 be 	 cause 	 	 owner 	 ship 	 	 network 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 bor 	 ing 	 	to	 stud 	 y 	 	.
well	,	 a 	 s 	 	 owner 	 ship 	 	is	related	to	control	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 hall 	 	explain	 lat 	 er 	 	,	looking	at	 owner 	 ship 	 	 network 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	can	give	you	 answer 	 s 	 	to	 question 	 s 	 	like	,	who	are	the	key	 player 	 s 	 	?
how	are	they	 organize 	 d 	 	?	are	they	 isolate 	 d 	 	?
are	they	 interconnect 	 ed 	 	?
and	what	is	the	 over 	 all 	 	 distribut 	 ion 	 	of	control	?	in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	who	 control 	 s 	 	the	world	?
i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	question	.
and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 implic 	 ations 	 	for	 system 	 ic 	 	risk	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	measure	of	how	 vulner 	 able 	 	a	system	is	 over 	 all 	 	.
a	high	degree	of	 interconnect 	 ivity 	 	can	be	bad	for	 st 	 ability 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	then	the	stress	can	spread	through	the	system	like	an	 epi 	 demic 	 	.
 scientist 	 s 	 	have	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 critic 	 ized 	 	 economist 	 s 	 	who	 believ 	 e 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	and	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	are	more	 import 	 ant 	 	than	 empir 	 ical 	 	data	,	 be 	 cause 	 	a	foundational	 guide 	 line 	 	in	science	is	:	let	the	data	speak	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	let	's	do	that	.
so	we	 start 	 ed 	 	with	a	 data 	 base 	 	 contain 	 ing 	 	13	million	 owner 	 ship 	 	 relation 	 s 	 	from	2007	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	lot	of	data	,	and	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	find	out	who	 rule 	 s 	 	the	world	,	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	focus	on	 trans 	 national 	 	 corporation 	 s 	 	,	or	tncs	for	short	.
these	are	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	that	 oper 	 ate 	 	in	more	than	one	country	,	and	we	found	43,000	.
in	the	next	step	,	we	built	the	network	around	these	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	,	so	we	took	all	the	tncs	'	 share 	 holder 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 share 	 holder 	 s 	 	'	 share 	 holder 	 s 	 	,	etc	.	,	all	the	way	 up 	 stream 	 	,	and	we	did	the	same	 down 	 stream 	 	,	and	 end 	 ed 	 	up	with	a	network	 contain 	 ing 	 	600,000	 nod 	 es 	 	and	one	million	 link 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	tnc	network	which	we	 analyz 	 ed 	 	.
and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	be	 structure 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 follow 	 s 	 	.
so	you	have	a	 per 	 iph 	 ery 	 	and	a	center	which	 contain 	 s 	 	about	75	percent	of	all	the	 player 	 s 	 	,	and	in	the	center	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	 tin 	 y 	 	but	 domin 	 ant 	 	core	which	is	made	up	of	 high 	 ly 	 	 interconnect 	 ed 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.
to	give	you	a	better	picture	,	think	about	a	 metro 	 politan 	 	area	.
so	you	have	the	 suburb 	 s 	 	and	the	 per 	 iph 	 ery 	 	,	you	have	a	center	like	a	financial	 di 	 strict 	 	,	then	the	core	will	be	 some 	 thing 	 	like	the	 tall 	 est 	 	high	rise	building	in	the	center	.
and	we	 al 	 ready 	 	see	 sign 	 s 	 	of	 organ 	 ization 	 	going	on	here	.
thirty	-	six	percent	of	the	tncs	are	in	the	core	 on 	 ly 	 	,	but	they	make	up	95	percent	of	the	total	 oper 	 ating 	 	revenue	of	all	tncs	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	now	we	 analyz 	 ed 	 	the	structure	,	so	how	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 late 	 	to	the	control	?
well	,	 owner 	 ship 	 	 give 	 s 	 	 vot 	 ing 	 	 right 	 s 	 	to	 share 	 holder 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	normal	 not 	 ion 	 	of	control	.
and	there	are	different	 model 	 s 	 	which	allow	you	to	compute	the	control	you	get	from	 owner 	 ship 	 	.
if	you	have	more	than	50	percent	of	the	 share 	 s 	 	in	a	company	,	you	get	control	,	but	 usual 	 ly 	 	it	 depend 	 s 	 	on	the	 relat 	 ive 	 	 distribut 	 ion 	 	of	 share 	 s 	 	.
and	the	network	 re 	 ally 	 	 matter 	 s 	 	.
about	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	mr.	tronchetti	provera	had	 owner 	 ship 	 	and	control	in	a	small	company	,	which	had	 owner 	 ship 	 	and	control	in	a	 big 	 ger 	 	company	.
you	get	the	idea	.
 th 	 is 	 	 end 	 ed 	 	up	giving	him	control	in	 tele 	 com 	 	italia	with	a	leverage	of	26	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	,	with	each	euro	he	 invest 	 ed 	 	,	he	was	able	to	move	26	 eur 	 os 	 	of	market	value	through	the	chain	of	 owner 	 ship 	 	 relation 	 s 	 	.
now	what	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 compute 	 d 	 	in	our	 stud 	 y 	 	was	the	control	over	the	tncs	'	value	.
 th 	 is 	 	 allow 	 ed 	 	us	to	assign	a	degree	of	influence	to	each	 share 	 holder 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	much	in	the	sense	of	max	weber	's	idea	of	potential	power	,	which	is	the	 prob 	 ability 	 	of	 im 	 posing 	 	one	's	own	will	 de 	 spite 	 	the	 op 	 position 	 	of	 other 	 s 	 	.
if	you	want	to	compute	the	flow	in	an	 owner 	 ship 	 	network	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	you	have	to	do	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	not	that	hard	to	understand	.
let	me	explain	by	giving	you	 th 	 is 	 	 analog 	 y 	 	.
so	think	about	water	 flow 	 ing 	 	in	 pipe 	 s 	 	where	the	 pipe 	 s 	 	have	different	 thick 	 ness 	 	.
so	 similar 	 ly 	 	,	the	control	is	 flow 	 ing 	 	in	the	 owner 	 ship 	 	 network 	 s 	 	and	is	 accumul 	 ating 	 	at	the	 nod 	 es 	 	.
so	what	did	we	find	after	computing	all	 th 	 is 	 	network	control	?
well	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	the	737	top	 share 	 holder 	 s 	 	have	the	potential	to	 collect 	 ively 	 	control	80	percent	of	the	tncs	'	value	.
now	remember	,	we	 start 	 ed 	 	out	with	600,000	 nod 	 es 	 	,	so	these	737	top	 player 	 s 	 	make	up	a	bit	more	than	0.1	percent	.
they	're	 most 	 ly 	 	financial	 institution 	 s 	 	in	the	u.s.	and	the	u.k	.
and	it	 get 	 s 	 	even	more	 extrem 	 e 	 	.
there	are	146	top	 player 	 s 	 	in	the	core	,	and	they	together	have	the	potential	to	 collect 	 ively 	 	control	40	percent	of	the	tncs	'	value	.
what	should	you	take	home	from	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	?
well	,	the	high	degree	of	control	you	saw	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 	by	any	standard	.
the	high	degree	of	 interconnect 	 ivity 	 	of	the	top	 player 	 s 	 	in	the	core	could	pose	a	significant	 system 	 ic 	 	risk	to	the	global	 eco 	 nomy 	 	and	we	could	 eas 	 ily 	 	 re 	 produce 	 	the	tnc	network	with	a	few	simple	 rule 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	 it 	 s 	 	structure	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	result	of	self	-	 organ 	 ization 	 	.
it	's	an	 emerge 	 nt 	 	 proper 	 ty 	 	which	 depend 	 s 	 	on	the	 rule 	 s 	 	of	 interact 	 ion 	 	in	the	system	,	so	it	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	not	the	result	of	a	top	-	down	approach	like	a	global	 conspi 	 racy 	 	.
our	 stud 	 y 	 	``	is	an	impression	of	the	moon	's	surface	.
it	's	not	a	street	map	.	``	so	you	should	take	the	exact	 number 	 s 	 	in	our	 stud 	 y 	 	with	a	grain	of	salt	,	yet	it	``	 g 	 ave 	 	us	a	 tan 	 tal 	 izing 	 	 glimps 	 e 	 	of	a	brave	new	world	of	finance	.	``	we	hope	to	have	 open 	 ed 	 	the	door	for	more	 s 	 uch 	 	research	in	 th 	 is 	 	direction	,	so	the	 remain 	 ing 	 	 un 	 known 	 	 terra 	 in 	 	will	be	 chart 	 ed 	 	in	the	future	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	.
we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	the	emergence	of	long	-	term	and	 high 	 ly 	 	-	funded	 program 	 s 	 	which	aim	at	 understand 	 ing 	 	our	 network 	 ed 	 	world	from	a	 complex 	 ity 	 	point	of	view	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	journey	 ha 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	just	 beg 	 un 	 	,	so	we	will	have	to	wait	before	we	see	the	first	 result 	 s 	 	.
now	there	is	still	a	big	problem	,	in	my	opinion	.
 idea 	 s 	 	 relat 	 ing 	 	to	finance	,	 economic 	 s 	 	,	 politic 	 s 	 	,	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	are	 ver 	 y 	 	often	 tain 	 ted 	 	by	people	's	personal	 ideo 	 logies 	 	.
i	 re 	 ally 	 	hope	that	 th 	 is 	 	 complex 	 ity 	 	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	 allow 	 s 	 	for	some	common	ground	to	be	found	.
it	would	be	 re 	 ally 	 	great	if	it	 ha 	 s 	 	the	power	to	help	end	the	 grid 	 lock 	 	 create 	 d 	 	by	 conflict 	 ing 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	,	which	 appear 	 s 	 	to	be	 para 	 ly 	 z 	 ing 	 	our	 global 	 ized 	 	world	.
 re 	 ality 	 	is	so	complex	,	we	need	to	move	away	from	dogma	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	my	own	personal	 ideo 	 logy 	 	.
thank	you	.
