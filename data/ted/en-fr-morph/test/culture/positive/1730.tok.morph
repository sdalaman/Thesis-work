all	right	,	so	let	's	take	four	 subject 	 s 	 	that	 obvious 	 ly 	 	go	together	:	big	data	,	 tattoo 	 s 	 	,	 im 	 mortal 	 ity 	 	and	the	greeks	.
right	?
now	,	the	issue	about	 tattoo 	 s 	 	is	that	,	 with 	 out 	 	a	word	,	 tattoo 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	do	shout	.
[	 beaut 	 iful 	 	]	[	 intrigu 	 ing 	 	]	so	you	do	n't	have	to	say	a	lot	.
[	allegiance	]	[	 ver 	 y 	 	 intima 	 te 	 	]	[	serious	 mistak 	 es 	 	]	and	 tattoo 	 s 	 	tell	you	a	lot	of	 st 	 ories 	 	.
if	i	can	ask	an	 in 	 discreet 	 	question	,	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	have	 tattoo 	 s 	 	?
a	few	,	but	not	most	.
what	 happen 	 s 	 	if	facebook	,	google	,	twitter	,	linkedin	,	cell	 phone 	 s 	 	,	gps	,	 four 	 square 	 	,	yelp	,	travel	advisor	,	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	you	deal	with	every	day	turn	out	to	be	 electron 	 ic 	 	 tattoo 	 s 	 	?
and	what	if	they	provide	 a 	 s 	 	much	information	about	who	and	what	you	are	 a 	 s 	 	any	tattoo	ever	would	?
what	's	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 happen 	 ing 	 	over	the	past	few	 decade 	 s 	 	is	the	kind	of	 cover 	 age 	 	that	you	had	 a 	 s 	 	a	head	of	state	or	 a 	 s 	 	a	great	 celebr 	 ity 	 	is	now	 be 	 ing 	 	 appli 	 ed 	 	to	you	every	day	by	all	these	people	who	are	 tweet 	 ing 	 	,	 b 	 logging 	 	,	 follow 	 ing 	 	you	,	 watch 	 ing 	 	your	credit	 score 	 s 	 	and	what	you	do	to	 your 	 self 	 	.
and	 electron 	 ic 	 	 tattoo 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	shout	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	of	the	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	of	that	,	it	's	 get 	 ting 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	to	hide	from	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	,	among	other	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	not	just	the	 electron 	 ic 	 	 tattoo 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 fa 	 cial 	 	 re 	 cognition 	 	that	's	 get 	 ting 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	good	.
so	you	can	take	a	picture	with	an	iphone	and	get	all	the	 name 	 s 	 	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	it	 do 	 es 	 	make	 mistak 	 es 	 	.
but	that	 mean 	 s 	 	you	can	take	a	typical	bar	scene	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	take	a	picture	,	say	,	of	 th 	 is 	 	guy	right	here	,	get	the	name	,	and	download	all	the	 record 	 s 	 	before	you	utter	a	word	or	speak	to	 some 	 body 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 every 	 body 	 	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	be	 absolute 	 ly 	 	plastered	by	 electron 	 ic 	 	 tattoo 	 s 	 	.
and	so	there	's	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	like	face.com	that	now	have	about	18	billion	 face 	 s 	 	 on 	 line 	 	.
here	's	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	company	.
[	company	 s 	 old 	 	to	facebook	,	june	18	,	2012	...	]	there	are	other	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	that	will	place	a	camera	like	 th 	 is 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	facebook	--	they	take	your	picture	,	they	tie	it	to	the	social	media	,	they	figure	out	you	 re 	 ally 	 	like	to	wear	black	 dress 	 es 	 	,	so	 may 	 be 	 	the	person	in	the	store	 come 	 s 	 	up	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	we	've	got	five	black	 dress 	 es 	 	that	would	just	look	great	on	you	.	``	so	what	if	andy	was	wrong	?
here	's	andy	's	 theor 	 y 	 	.
[	in	the	future	,	 every 	 body 	 	will	be	world	famous	for	15	 minute 	 s 	 	.	]	what	if	we	flip	 th 	 is 	 	?
what	if	you	're	 on 	 ly 	 	going	to	be	 anonym 	 ous 	 	for	15	 minute 	 s 	 	?
well	,	then	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 electron 	 ic 	 	 tattoo 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	all	of	you	and	all	of	us	are	 ver 	 y 	 	close	to	 im 	 mortal 	 ity 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	these	 tattoo 	 s 	 	will	live	far	 long 	 er 	 	than	our	bodies	will	.
and	if	that	's	true	,	then	what	we	want	to	do	is	we	want	to	go	through	four	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	from	the	greeks	and	one	 less 	 on 	 	from	a	latin	american	.
why	the	greeks	?
well	,	the	greeks	thought	about	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	 god 	 s 	 	and	 human 	 s 	 	and	 im 	 mortal 	 ity 	 	mix	for	a	long	time	.
so	 less 	 on 	 	number	one	:	sisyphus	.
remember	?	he	did	a	 horr 	 ible 	 	thing	,	 condemn 	 ed 	 	for	all	time	to	roll	 th 	 is 	 	rock	up	,	it	would	roll	back	down	,	roll	back	up	,	roll	back	down	.
it	's	a	little	like	your	reputation	.
once	you	get	that	 electron 	 ic 	 	tattoo	,	you	're	going	to	be	 roll 	 ing 	 	up	and	down	for	a	long	time	,	so	 a 	 s 	 	you	go	through	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	,	just	be	 care 	 ful 	 	what	you	post	.
myth	number	two	:	orpheus	,	 wonder 	 ful 	 	guy	,	 charm 	 ing 	 	to	be	around	,	great	partier	,	great	 s 	 ing 	 er 	 	,	 lose 	 s 	 	his	 be 	 love 	 d 	 	,	charms	his	way	 in 	 to 	 	the	 under 	 world 	 	,	 on 	 ly 	 	person	to	charm	his	way	 in 	 to 	 	the	 under 	 world 	 	,	charms	the	 god 	 s 	 	of	the	 under 	 world 	 	,	they	 re 	 lease 	 	his	 beaut 	 y 	 	on	the	condition	he	never	look	at	her	 un 	 til 	 	they	're	out	.
so	he	's	 walk 	 ing 	 	out	and	 walk 	 ing 	 	out	and	 walk 	 ing 	 	out	and	he	just	ca	n't	resist	.	he	 look 	 s 	 	at	her	,	 lose 	 s 	 	her	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
with	all	 th 	 is 	 	data	out	here	,	it	might	be	a	good	idea	not	to	look	too	far	 in 	 to 	 	the	past	of	 t 	 hose 	 	you	love	.
 less 	 on 	 	number	three	:	atalanta	.
 great 	 est 	 	runner	.	she	would	 challeng 	 e 	 	 any 	 body 	 	.
if	you	won	,	she	would	marry	you	.
if	you	lost	,	you	 di 	 ed 	 	.
how	did	hippomenes	beat	her	?
well	,	he	had	all	these	 wonder 	 ful 	 	little	 gold 	 en 	 	 apple 	 s 	 	,	and	she	'd	run	 a 	 head 	 	,	and	he	'd	roll	a	little	 gold 	 en 	 	apple	.
she	'd	run	 a 	 head 	 	,	and	he	'd	roll	a	little	 gold 	 en 	 	apple	.
she	 ke 	 pt 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 distract 	 ed 	 	.	he	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	won	the	race	.
just	remember	the	purpose	 a 	 s 	 	all	these	little	 gold 	 en 	 	 apple 	 s 	 	come	and	reach	you	and	you	want	to	post	about	them	or	tweet	about	them	or	 s 	 end 	 	a	late	-	night	 mess 	 age 	 	.
and	then	,	of	course	,	there	's	narcissus	.
 no 	 body 	 	here	would	ever	be	 accus 	 ed 	 	or	be	familiar	with	narcissus	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	about	narcissus	,	just	do	n't	fall	in	love	with	your	own	 reflect 	 ion 	 	.
last	 less 	 on 	 	,	from	a	latin	american	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	great	poet	jorge	luis	borges	.
when	he	was	 threaten 	 ed 	 	by	the	thugs	of	the	argentine	 militar 	 y 	 	junta	,	he	came	back	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	oh	,	come	on	,	how	else	can	you	threaten	,	other	than	with	death	?	``	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	,	the	original	thing	,	would	be	to	threaten	 some 	 body 	 	with	 im 	 mortal 	 ity 	 	.
and	that	,	of	course	,	is	what	we	are	all	now	 threaten 	 ed 	 	with	 to 	 day 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 electron 	 ic 	 	 tattoo 	 s 	 	.
thank	you	.
