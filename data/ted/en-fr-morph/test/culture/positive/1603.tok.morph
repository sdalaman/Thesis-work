i	was	one	of	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	in	college	who	had	a	reason	to	go	to	the	p.o	.	box	at	the	end	of	the	day	,	and	that	was	 main 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	my	mother	 ha 	 s 	 	never	 believ 	 ed 	 	in	email	,	in	facebook	,	in	 text 	 ing 	 	or	cell	 phone 	 s 	 	in	general	.
and	so	while	other	 kid 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	bbm	-	ing	 the 	 ir 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	,	i	was	 liter 	 ally 	 	 wait 	 ing 	 	by	the	 mail 	 box 	 	to	get	a	letter	from	home	to	see	how	the	 week 	 end 	 	had	gone	,	which	was	a	little	 frust 	 rating 	 	when	grandma	was	in	the	hospital	,	but	i	was	just	looking	for	some	sort	of	 s 	 crib 	 ble 	 	,	some	 un 	 kempt 	 	 cur 	 s 	 ive 	 	from	my	mother	.
and	so	when	i	 move 	 d 	 	to	new	york	city	after	college	and	got	 complete 	 ly 	 	 suck 	 er 	 	-	 punch 	 ed 	 	in	the	face	by	 depress 	 ion 	 	,	i	did	the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	i	could	think	of	at	the	time	.	i	wrote	 t 	 hose 	 	same	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 letter 	 s 	 	that	my	mother	had	written	me
for	 strange 	 rs 	 	,	and	 tuck 	 ed 	 	them	all	 through 	 out 	 	the	city	,	 dozen 	 s 	 	and	 dozen 	 s 	 	of	them	.	i	left	them	 every 	 where 	 	,
in	 cafe 	 s 	 	and	in	 lib 	 r 	 aries 	 	,	at	the	u.n.	,	 every 	 where 	 	.
i	 blog 	 ged 	 	about	 t 	 hose 	 	 letter 	 s 	 	and	the	 day 	 s 	 	when	they	 we 	 re 	 	 necess 	 ary 	 	,	and	i	posed	a	kind	of	crazy	promise	to	the	 inter 	 net 	 	:	that	if	you	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	for	a	hand	-	written	letter	,	i	would	write	you	one	,	no	 question 	 s 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	.
 over 	 night 	 	,	my	 in 	 box 	 	 morph 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	harbor	of	 heart 	 break 	 	--	a	single	mother	in	sacramento	,	a	girl	 be 	 ing 	 	 bull 	 ied 	 	in	 r 	 ural 	 	kansas	,	all	 ask 	 ing 	 	me	,	a	22	-	year	-	old	girl	who	 bare 	 ly 	 	even	 k 	 new 	 	her	own	coffee	order	,	to	write	them	a	love	letter	and	give	them	a	reason	to	wait	by	the	 mail 	 box 	 	.
well	,	 to 	 day 	 	i	fuel	a	global	 organ 	 ization 	 	that	is	 fuel 	 ed 	 	by	 t 	 hose 	 	 trip 	 s 	 	to	the	 mail 	 box 	 	,	 fuel 	 ed 	 	by	the	ways	in	which	we	can	harness	social	media	like	never	before	to	write	and	mail	 strange 	 rs 	 	 letter 	 s 	 	when	they	need	them	most	,	but	most	of	all	,	 fuel 	 ed 	 	by	crates	of	mail	like	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	my	 trust 	 y 	 	mail	 crat 	 e 	 	,	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	the	scriptings	of	 ordin 	 ary 	 	people	,	 strange 	 rs 	 	writing	 letter 	 s 	 	to	other	 strange 	 rs 	 	not	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	ever	going	to	meet	and	laugh	over	a	cup	of	coffee	,	but	 be 	 cause 	 	they	have	found	one	 an 	 other 	 	by	way	of	letter	-	writing	.
but	,	you	know	,	the	thing	that	 al 	 ways 	 	 get 	 s 	 	me	about	these	 letter 	 s 	 	is	that	most	of	them	have	 be 	 en 	 	written	by	people	that	have	never	known	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 love 	 d 	 	on	a	piece	of	paper	.
they	could	not	tell	you	about	the	ink	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	love	 letter 	 s 	 	.
they	're	the	 one 	 s 	 	from	my	generation	,	the	 one 	 s 	 	of	us	that	have	grown	up	 in 	 to 	 	a	world	where	 every 	 thing 	 	is	 paper 	 less 	 	,	and	where	some	of	our	best	 conversation 	 s 	 	have	 happen 	 ed 	 	 up 	 on 	 	a	screen	.
we	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	to	 di 	 ary 	 	our	pain	onto	facebook	,	and	we	speak	 swift 	 ly 	 	in	140	 character 	 s 	 	or	less	.
but	what	if	it	's	not	about	efficiency	 th 	 is 	 	time	?
i	was	on	the	 sub 	 way 	 	 yester 	 day 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	mail	 crat 	 e 	 	,	which	is	a	conversation	 start 	 er 	 	,	let	me	tell	you	.	if	you	ever	need	one	,	just	carry	one	of	these	.	and	a	man	just	 star 	 ed 	 	at	me	,	and	he	was	like	,	``	well	,	why	do	n't	you	use	the	 inter 	 net 	 	?	``
and	i	thought	,	``	well	,	 s 	 ir 	 	,	i	am	not	a	strategist	,	nor	am	i	 special 	 ist 	 	.	i	am	 mere 	 ly 	 	a	 story 	 teller 	 	.	``
and	so	i	could	tell	you	about	a	woman	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	husband	 ha 	 s 	 	just	come	home	from	afghanistan	,	and	she	is	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	hard	time	 un 	 earth 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	thing	 call 	 ed 	 	conversation	,	and	so	she	 tuck 	 s 	 	love	 letter 	 s 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	house	 a 	 s 	 	a	way	to	say	,	``	come	back	to	me	.
find	me	when	you	can	.	``
or	a	girl	who	 decide 	 s 	 	that	she	is	going	to	 leav 	 e 	 	love	 letter 	 s 	 	around	her	campus	in	dubuque	,	iowa	,	 on 	 ly 	 	to	find	her	 effort 	 s 	 	ripple	-	 effect 	 ed 	 	the	next	day	when	she	 walk 	 s 	 	out	onto	the	quad	and	 find 	 s 	 	love	 letter 	 s 	 	 hang 	 ing 	 	from	the	 tree 	 s 	 	,	 tuck 	 ed 	 	in	the	 bush 	 es 	 	and	the	 bench 	 es 	 	.
or	the	man	who	 decide 	 s 	 	that	he	is	going	to	take	his	life	,	uses	facebook	 a 	 s 	 	a	way	to	say	 good 	 bye 	 	to	 friend 	 s 	 	and	family	.
well	,	 to 	 night 	 	he	 sleep 	 s 	 	 safe 	 ly 	 	with	a	stack	of	 letter 	 s 	 	just	like	 th 	 is 	 	one	 tuck 	 ed 	 	 be 	 neath 	 	his	 pil 	 low 	 	,	 script 	 ed 	 	by	 strange 	 rs 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	there	for	him	when	.
these	are	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 st 	 ories 	 	that	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	me	that	letter	-	writing	will	never	 aga 	 in 	 	need	to	flip	back	her	hair	and	talk	about	efficiency	,	 be 	 cause 	 	she	is	an	art	form	now	,
all	the	 part 	 s 	 	of	her	,	the	 sign 	 ing 	 	,	the	 script 	 ing 	 	,	the	 mail 	 ing 	 	,	the	 doodle 	 s 	 	in	the	 margin 	 s 	 	.	the	mere	fact	that	 some 	 body 	 	would	even	just	 s 	 it 	 	down	,	pull	out	a	piece	of	paper	and	think	about	 some 	 one 	 	the	whole	way	through	,	with	an	 intent 	 ion 	 	that	is	so	much	 hard 	 er 	 	to	 un 	 earth 	 	when	the	 brow 	 s 	 er 	 	is	up	and	the	iphone	is	 ping 	 ing 	 	and	we	've	got	six	 conversation 	 s 	 	 roll 	 ing 	 	in	at	once	,	that	is	an	art	form	that	 do 	 es 	 	not	fall	down	to	the	 golia 	 th 	 	of	``	get	 fast 	 er 	 	,	``	no	matter	how	 man 	 y 	 	social	 network 	 s 	 	we	might	join	.
we	still	clutch	close	these	 letter 	 s 	 	to	our	chest	,	to	the	 word 	 s 	 	that	speak	 loud 	 er 	 	than	loud	,	when	we	turn	 page 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 pal 	 ette 	 s 	 	to	say	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	have	 need 	 ed 	 	to	say	,	the	 word 	 s 	 	that	we	have	 need 	 ed 	 	to	write	,	to	 sister 	 s 	 	and	 brother 	 s 	 	and	even	to	 strange 	 rs 	 	,	for	far	too	long	.
thank	you	.
