so	,	 embryo 	 nic 	 	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	.
they	are	our	body	's	own	repair	 kit 	 s 	 	,	and	they	're	 pluri 	 potent 	 	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	they	can	morph	 in 	 to 	 	all	of	the	 cell 	 s 	 	in	our	bodies	.
soon	,	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	will	be	able	to	use	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	to	replace	 cell 	 s 	 	that	are	 damage 	 d 	 	or	 disease 	 d 	 	.
but	that	's	not	what	i	want	to	talk	to	you	about	,	 be 	 cause 	 	right	now	there	are	some	 re 	 ally 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	are	 do 	 ing 	 	with	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	that	are	 complete 	 ly 	 	changing	the	way	we	look	and	model	disease	,	our	ability	to	understand	why	we	get	sick	,	and	even	develop	 drug 	 s 	 	.
i	 tru 	 ly 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	stem	cell	research	is	going	to	allow	our	children	to	look	at	alzheimer	's	and	diabetes	and	other	major	 disease 	 s 	 	the	way	we	view	 poli 	 o 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	which	is	 a 	 s 	 	a	 prevent 	 able 	 	disease	.
so	here	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	field	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	enormous	hope	for	 human 	 ity 	 	,	but	much	like	ivf	over	35	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 un 	 til 	 	the	birth	of	a	 health 	 y 	 	baby	,	louise	,	 th 	 is 	 	field	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	under	siege	 politic 	 ally 	 	and	 financial 	 ly 	 	.
critical	research	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 challeng 	 ed 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 support 	 ed 	 	,	and	we	saw	that	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	essential	to	have	private	safe	 have 	 n 	 	 labor 	 ator 	 ies 	 	where	 th 	 is 	 	work	could	be	 advance 	 d 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 inter 	 ference 	 	.
and	so	,	in	2005	,	we	 start 	 ed 	 	the	new	york	stem	cell	 found 	 ation 	 	 labor 	 atory 	 	so	that	we	would	have	a	small	 organ 	 ization 	 	that	could	do	 th 	 is 	 	work	and	support	it	.
what	we	saw	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	is	the	world	of	both	medical	research	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 develop 	 ing 	 	 drug 	 s 	 	and	 treat 	 ments 	 	,	is	 dominate 	 d 	 	by	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	would	expect	,	large	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	,	but	in	a	new	field	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	large	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	have	trouble	 get 	 ting 	 	out	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	way	,	and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	they	ca	n't	ask	the	right	 question 	 s 	 	,	and	there	is	an	enormous	gap	that	's	just	gotten	 large 	 r 	 	between	academic	research	on	the	one	hand	and	pharmaceutical	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	and	biotechs	that	are	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	 deliver 	 ing 	 	all	of	our	 drug 	 s 	 	and	 man 	 y 	 	of	our	 treat 	 ments 	 	,	and	so	we	 k 	 new 	 	that	to	 re 	 ally 	 	 accele 	 rate 	 	 cure 	 s 	 	and	 ther 	 a 	 pies 	 	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	have	to	address	 th 	 is 	 	with	two	 thing 	 s 	 	:	new	 techno 	 logies 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	a	new	research	model	.
 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	do	n't	close	that	gap	,	you	 re 	 ally 	 	are	 exact 	 ly 	 	where	we	are	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	that	's	what	i	want	to	focus	on	.
we	've	 s 	 pent 	 	the	last	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	 ponder 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	making	a	list	of	the	different	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	had	to	do	,	and	so	we	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	new	technology	,	it	's	 soft 	 ware 	 	and	 hard 	 ware 	 	,	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	can	generate	 thousand 	 s 	 	and	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 genetic 	 ally 	 	 divers 	 e 	 	stem	cell	lines	to	create	a	global	array	,	 essential 	 ly 	 	 avatar 	 s 	 	of	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
and	we	did	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	think	that	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	to	allow	us	to	 real 	 ize 	 	the	potential	,	the	promise	,	of	all	of	the	 s 	 equ 	 encing 	 	of	the	human	genome	,	but	it	's	going	to	allow	us	,	in	 do 	 ing 	 	that	,	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	 clinic 	 al 	 	 trial 	 s 	 	in	a	dish	with	human	 cell 	 s 	 	,	not	animal	 cell 	 s 	 	,	to	generate	 drug 	 s 	 	and	 treat 	 ments 	 	that	are	much	more	effective	,	much	 safe 	 r 	 	,	much	 fast 	 er 	 	,	and	at	a	much	lower	cost	.
so	let	me	put	that	in	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	for	you	and	give	you	some	 con 	 text 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	new	field	.
in	1998	,	human	 embryo 	 nic 	 	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	first	identified	,	and	just	nine	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	a	group	of	 scientist 	 s 	 	in	japan	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	take	skin	 cell 	 s 	 	and	 re 	 program 	 	them	with	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	viruses	to	create	a	kind	of	 pluri 	 potent 	 	stem	cell	 call 	 ed 	 	an	induced	 pluri 	 potent 	 	stem	cell	,	or	what	we	refer	to	 a 	 s 	 	an	ips	cell	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	 re 	 ally 	 	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	advance	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	these	 cell 	 s 	 	are	not	human	 embryo 	 nic 	 	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	,	which	still	remain	the	gold	standard	,	they	are	 terr 	 ific 	 	to	use	for	 model 	 ing 	 	disease	and	 potential 	 ly 	 	for	drug	 discover 	 y 	 	.
so	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	in	2008	,	one	of	our	 scientist 	 s 	 	built	on	that	research	.	he	took	skin	 bio 	 psies 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	time	from	people	who	had	a	disease	,	als	,	or	 a 	 s 	 	you	call	it	in	the	u.k.	,	motor	 neuro 	 n 	 	disease	.
he	 turn 	 ed 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	the	ips	 cell 	 s 	 	that	i	've	just	told	you	about	,	and	then	he	 turn 	 ed 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	ips	 cell 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	motor	 neuro 	 ns 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 dy 	 ing 	 	in	the	disease	.
so	 bas 	 ically 	 	what	he	did	was	to	take	a	 health 	 y 	 	cell	and	turn	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	sick	cell	,	and	he	 recapitulate 	 d 	 	the	disease	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	in	the	dish	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	was	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	the	first	time	that	we	had	a	model	of	a	disease	from	a	living	patient	in	living	human	 cell 	 s 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	he	 watch 	 ed 	 	the	disease	 un 	 fold 	 	,	he	was	able	to	discover	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	motor	 neuro 	 ns 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 dy 	 ing 	 	in	the	disease	in	a	different	way	than	the	field	had	 previous 	 ly 	 	thought	.	there	was	 an 	 other 	 	kind	of	cell	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	was	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	out	a	toxin	and	 con 	 trib 	 uting 	 	to	the	death	of	these	motor	 neuro 	 ns 	 	,	and	you	 simpl 	 y 	 	could	n't	see	it	 un 	 til 	 	you	had	the	human	model	.
so	you	could	 re 	 ally 	 	say	that	 research 	 ers 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	the	cause	of	disease	 with 	 out 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	have	human	stem	cell	 model 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	much	like	 invest 	 igator 	 s 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	what	had	gone	 terr 	 ibly 	 	wrong	in	a	plane	crash	 with 	 out 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	black	box	,	or	a	flight	 record 	 er 	 	.
they	could	hypothesize	about	what	had	gone	wrong	,	but	they	 re 	 ally 	 	had	no	way	of	 know 	 ing 	 	what	led	to	the	 terr 	 ible 	 	 event 	 s 	 	.
and	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	have	 give 	 n 	 	us	the	black	box	for	 disease 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	an	unprecedented	window	.
it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	can	recapitulate	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	in	a	dish	,	you	can	see	what	 begin 	 s 	 	to	go	wrong	in	the	cellular	conversation	well	before	you	would	ever	see	 symptom 	 s 	 	appear	in	a	patient	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 open 	 s 	 	up	the	ability	,	which	 hope 	 fully 	 	will	 be 	 come 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	routine	in	the	near	term	,	of	using	human	 cell 	 s 	 	to	test	for	 drug 	 s 	 	.
right	now	,	the	way	we	test	for	 drug 	 s 	 	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	 problem 	 atic 	 	.
to	 br 	 ing 	 	a	 success 	 ful 	 	drug	to	market	,	it	 take 	 s 	 	,	on	average	,	13	 year 	 s 	 	--	that	's	one	drug	--	with	a	 s 	 un 	 k 	 	cost	of	4	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	and	 on 	 ly 	 	one	percent	of	the	 drug 	 s 	 	that	start	down	that	road	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	to	get	there	.
you	ca	n't	imagine	other	 business 	 es 	 	that	you	would	think	of	going	 in 	 to 	 	that	have	these	kind	of	 number 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	business	model	.
but	it	is	 re 	 ally 	 	a	 wo 	 rse 	 	social	model	 be 	 cause 	 	of	what	's	 involve 	 d 	 	and	the	cost	to	all	of	us	.
so	the	way	we	develop	 drug 	 s 	 	now	is	by	 test 	 ing 	 	promising	 com 	 pound 	 s 	 	on	--	we	did	n't	have	disease	 model 	 ing 	 	with	human	 cell 	 s 	 	,	so	we	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 test 	 ing 	 	them	on	 cell 	 s 	 	of	 mic 	 e 	 	or	other	 creature 	 s 	 	or	 cell 	 s 	 	that	we	engineer	,	but	they	do	n't	have	the	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	of	the	 disease 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	cure	.
you	know	,	we	're	not	 mic 	 e 	 	,	and	you	ca	n't	go	 in 	 to 	 	a	living	person	with	an	 ill 	 ness 	 	and	just	pull	out	a	few	brain	 cell 	 s 	 	or	cardiac	 cell 	 s 	 	and	then	start	 fool 	 ing 	 	around	in	a	lab	to	test	for	,	you	know	,	a	promising	drug	.
but	what	you	can	do	with	human	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	,	now	,	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	create	 avatar 	 s 	 	,	and	you	can	create	the	 cell 	 s 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	the	live	motor	 neuro 	 ns 	 	or	the	 beat 	 ing 	 	cardiac	 cell 	 s 	 	or	liver	 cell 	 s 	 	or	other	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 cell 	 s 	 	,	and	you	can	test	for	 drug 	 s 	 	,	promising	 com 	 pound 	 s 	 	,	on	the	actual	 cell 	 s 	 	that	you	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	affect	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	now	,	and	it	's	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	,	and	you	're	going	to	know	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	the	 ver 	 y 	 	early	 stage 	 s 	 	of	 do 	 ing 	 	your	assay	 develop 	 ment 	 	and	your	 test 	 ing 	 	,	you	're	not	going	to	have	to	wait	13	 year 	 s 	 	 un 	 til 	 	you	've	 br 	 ought 	 	a	drug	to	market	,	 on 	 ly 	 	to	find	out	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	,	or	even	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	 harm 	 s 	 	people	.
but	it	is	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	just	to	look	at	the	 cell 	 s 	 	from	a	few	people	or	a	small	group	of	people	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	to	step	back	.
we	've	got	to	look	at	the	big	picture	.
look	around	 th 	 is 	 	room	.	we	are	all	different	,	and	a	disease	that	i	might	have	,	if	i	had	alzheimer	's	disease	or	parkinson	's	disease	,	it	 prob 	 ably 	 	would	affect	me	 different 	 ly 	 	than	if	one	of	you	had	that	disease	,	and	if	we	both	had	parkinson	's	disease	,	and	we	took	the	same	 medic 	 ation 	 	,	but	we	had	different	genetic	 make 	 up 	 	,	we	 prob 	 ably 	 	would	have	a	different	result	,	and	it	could	well	be	that	a	drug	that	 work 	 ed 	 	 wonder 	 fully 	 	for	me	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 in 	 effective 	 	for	you	,	and	 similar 	 ly 	 	,	it	could	be	that	a	drug	that	is	 harm 	 ful 	 	for	you	is	safe	for	me	,	and	,	you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	 seem 	 s 	 	 total 	 ly 	 	obvious	,	but	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	it	is	not	the	way	that	the	pharmaceutical	industry	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 develop 	 ing 	 	 drug 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	now	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	had	the	 tool 	 s 	 	.
and	so	we	need	to	move	away	from	 th 	 is 	 	one	-	 s 	 ize 	 	-	 fit 	 s 	 	-	all	model	.
the	way	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 develop 	 ing 	 	 drug 	 s 	 	is	 essential 	 ly 	 	like	going	 in 	 to 	 	a	shoe	store	,	no	one	 ask 	 s 	 	you	what	 s 	 ize 	 	you	are	,	or	if	you	're	going	 danc 	 ing 	 	or	 hik 	 ing 	 	.
they	just	say	,	``	well	,	you	have	feet	,	here	are	your	 shoe 	 s 	 	.	``	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	with	 shoe 	 s 	 	,	and	our	bodies	are	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	more	 complic 	 ated 	 	than	just	our	feet	.
so	we	 re 	 ally 	 	have	to	change	 th 	 is 	 	.
there	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 ad 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	last	decade	.
there	's	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	drug	,	and	a	class	of	 drug 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	but	the	 part 	 icular 	 	drug	was	vioxx	,	and	for	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	 suffer 	 ing 	 	from	severe	 art 	 hritis 	 	pain	,	the	drug	was	an	absolute	 life 	 saver 	 	,	but	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	for	 an 	 other 	 	 sub 	 set 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	people	,	they	 suffer 	 ed 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	severe	heart	side	 effect 	 s 	 	,	and	for	a	 sub 	 set 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	people	,	the	side	 effect 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	so	severe	,	the	cardiac	side	 effect 	 s 	 	,	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	fatal	.
but	imagine	a	different	scenario	,	where	we	could	have	had	an	array	,	a	 genetic 	 ally 	 	 divers 	 e 	 	array	,	of	cardiac	 cell 	 s 	 	,	and	we	could	have	 actual 	 ly 	 	tested	that	drug	,	vioxx	,	in	 pe 	 tri 	 	 dish 	 es 	 	,	and	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	,	well	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	people	with	 th 	 is 	 	genetic	type	are	going	to	have	cardiac	side	 effect 	 s 	 	,	people	with	these	genetic	 sub 	 group 	 s 	 	or	genetic	 shoe 	 s 	 	 s 	 ize 	 s 	 	,	about	25,000	of	them	,	are	not	going	to	have	any	 problem 	 s 	 	.
the	people	for	whom	it	was	a	 life 	 saver 	 	could	have	still	taken	 the 	 ir 	 	medicine	.
the	people	for	whom	it	was	a	disaster	,	or	fatal	,	would	never	have	 be 	 en 	 	 give 	 n 	 	it	,	and	you	can	imagine	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	 out 	 come 	 	for	the	company	,	who	had	to	withdraw	the	drug	.
so	that	is	 terr 	 ific 	 	,	and	we	thought	,	all	right	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	solve	 th 	 is 	 	problem	,	 clear 	 ly 	 	we	have	to	think	about	 genetic 	 s 	 	,	we	have	to	think	about	human	 test 	 ing 	 	,	but	there	's	a	fundamental	problem	,	 be 	 cause 	 	right	now	,	stem	cell	lines	,	 a 	 s 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	are	,	and	lines	are	just	 group 	 s 	 	of	 cell 	 s 	 	,	they	are	made	by	hand	,	one	at	a	time	,	and	it	 take 	 s 	 	a	couple	of	 month 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 scal 	 able 	 	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	when	you	do	 thing 	 s 	 	by	hand	,	even	in	the	best	 labor 	 ator 	 ies 	 	,	you	have	 vari 	 ations 	 	in	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	,	and	you	need	to	know	,	if	you	're	making	a	drug	,	that	the	 aspir 	 in 	 	you	're	going	to	take	out	of	the	bottle	on	monday	is	the	same	 a 	 s 	 	the	 aspir 	 in 	 	that	's	going	to	come	out	of	the	bottle	on	wednesday	.
so	we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	we	thought	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	 artisan 	 al 	 	is	 wonder 	 ful 	 	in	,	you	know	,	your	 cloth 	 ing 	 	and	your	bread	and	 craft 	 s 	 	,	but	 artisan 	 al 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	is	n't	going	to	work	in	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	,	so	we	have	to	deal	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	even	with	that	,	there	still	was	 an 	 other 	 	big	hurdle	,	and	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	us	back	to	the	mapping	of	the	human	genome	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	all	different	.
we	know	from	the	 s 	 equ 	 encing 	 	of	the	human	genome	that	it	's	 show 	 n 	 	us	all	of	the	a	's	,	c	's	,	g	's	and	t	's	that	make	up	our	genetic	code	,	but	that	code	,	by	 it 	 self 	 	,	our	dna	,	is	like	looking	at	the	 one 	 s 	 	and	 zero 	 es 	 	of	the	computer	code	 with 	 out 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	computer	that	can	read	it	.
it	's	like	 hav 	 ing 	 	an	app	 with 	 out 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	 smart 	 phone 	 	.
we	 need 	 ed 	 	to	have	a	way	of	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	the	biology	to	that	 in 	 credible 	 	data	,	and	the	way	to	do	that	was	to	find	a	stand	-	in	,	a	 bio 	 logical 	 	stand	-	in	,	that	could	contain	all	of	the	genetic	information	,	but	have	it	be	 array 	 ed 	 	in	 s 	 uch 	 	a	way	 a 	 s 	 	it	could	be	read	together	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	create	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	avatar	.
we	need	to	have	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	from	all	the	genetic	sub	-	 type 	 s 	 	that	represent	who	we	are	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	've	built	.
it	's	an	 autom 	 ated 	 	robotic	technology	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	produce	 thousand 	 s 	 	and	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	stem	cell	lines	.	it	's	 genetic 	 ally 	 	 array 	 ed 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	 massive 	 ly 	 	parallel	 process 	 ing 	 	 cap 	 ability 	 	,	and	it	's	going	to	change	the	way	 drug 	 s 	 	are	 discover 	 ed 	 	,	we	hope	,	and	i	think	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	what	's	going	to	happen	is	that	we	're	going	to	want	to	re	-	screen	 drug 	 s 	 	,	on	 array 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	that	 al 	 ready 	 	exist	,	all	of	the	 drug 	 s 	 	that	 current 	 ly 	 	exist	,	and	in	the	future	,	you	're	going	to	be	taking	 drug 	 s 	 	and	 treat 	 ments 	 	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	tested	for	side	 effect 	 s 	 	on	all	of	the	relevant	 cell 	 s 	 	,	on	brain	 cell 	 s 	 	and	heart	 cell 	 s 	 	and	liver	 cell 	 s 	 	.
it	 re 	 ally 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	us	to	the	threshold	of	 personal 	 ized 	 	medicine	.
it	's	here	now	,	and	in	our	family	,	my	son	 ha 	 s 	 	type	1	diabetes	,	which	is	still	an	 incur 	 able 	 	disease	,	and	i	lost	my	 parent 	 s 	 	to	heart	disease	and	cancer	,	but	i	think	that	my	story	 prob 	 ably 	 	 sound 	 s 	 	familiar	to	you	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 prob 	 ably 	 	a	version	of	it	is	your	story	.
