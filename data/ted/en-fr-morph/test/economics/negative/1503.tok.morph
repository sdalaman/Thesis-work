i	'm	going	to	start	with	a	little	story	.
so	,	i	grew	up	in	 th 	 is 	 	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	.	when	i	was	15	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	i	went	from	 be 	 ing 	 	what	i	think	was	a	 s 	 trapping 	 	young	athlete	,	over	four	 month 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	 was 	 ting 	 	away	 un 	 til 	 	i	was	 bas 	 ically 	 	a	famine	victim	with	an	 un 	 que 	 nch 	 able 	 	thirst	.
i	had	 bas 	 ically 	 	 digest 	 ed 	 	away	my	body	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	all	came	to	a	head	when	i	was	on	a	 back 	 pack 	 ing 	 	trip	,	my	first	one	ever	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	on	old	rag	mountain	in	west	virginia	,	and	was	 put 	 ting 	 	my	face	 in 	 to 	 	puddles	of	water	and	 drink 	 ing 	 	like	a	dog	.
that	night	,	i	was	taken	 in 	 to 	 	the	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	room	and	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	type	1	diabetic	in	full	-	blown	ketoacidosis	.
and	i	 re 	 cover 	 ed 	 	,	 thank 	 s 	 	to	the	 miracle 	 s 	 	of	modern	medicine	,	insulin	and	other	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	 gain 	 ed 	 	all	my	weight	back	and	more	.
and	 some 	 thing 	 	festered	 in 	 side 	 	me	after	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
what	i	thought	about	was	,	what	 caus 	 ed 	 	the	diabetes	?
you	see	,	diabetes	is	an	 auto 	 immun 	 e 	 	disease	where	your	body	 fight 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	,	and	at	the	time	people	thought	that	 some 	 how 	 	 may 	 be 	 	 expo 	 s 	 ure 	 	to	a	pathogen	had	 trigger 	 ed 	 	my	 immun 	 e 	 	system	to	fight	the	pathogen	and	then	kill	the	 cell 	 s 	 	that	make	insulin	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	thought	for	a	long	period	of	time	,	and	that	's	in	fact	what	medicine	and	people	have	focused	on	 quit 	 e 	 	a	bit	,	the	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	that	do	bad	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	where	i	need	my	 assist 	 ant 	 	here	now	.
you	may	 recogn 	 ize 	 	her	.
so	,	i	went	 yester 	 day 	 	,	i	 apolog 	 ize 	 	,	i	 skip 	 ped 	 	a	few	of	the	 talk 	 s 	 	,	and	i	went	over	to	the	national	academy	of	 science 	 s 	 	building	,	and	they	sell	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	,	giant	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	.
and	here	we	go	!
so	you	have	caught	 fl 	 esh 	 	-	eating	disease	if	you	caught	that	one	.
i	got	ta	get	back	out	my	 base 	 ball 	 	ability	here	.
so	,	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	or	not	 surprising 	 ly 	 	,	most	of	the	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	they	sell	at	the	national	academy	building	are	 pathogen 	 s 	 	.
 every 	 body 	 	 focus 	 es 	 	on	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	kill	us	,	and	that	's	what	i	was	 focus 	 ing 	 	on	.
and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	we	are	 cover 	 ed 	 	in	a	cloud	of	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	us	good	much	of	the	time	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 kill 	 ing 	 	us	.
and	so	,	we	've	known	about	 th 	 is 	 	for	some	period	of	time	.
people	have	used	 micro 	 scope 	 s 	 	to	look	at	the	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	that	cover	us	,	i	know	you	're	not	 pay 	 ing 	 	attention	to	me	,	but	...
the	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	that	cover	us	.
and	if	you	look	at	them	in	the	 micro 	 scope 	 	,	you	can	see	that	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	10	 time 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	of	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	on	us	 a 	 s 	 	we	have	human	 cell 	 s 	 	.
there	's	more	mass	in	the	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	than	the	mass	of	our	brain	.
we	are	 liter 	 ally 	 	a	 tee 	 ming 	 	 eco 	 system 	 	of	 micro 	 organism 	 s 	 	.
and	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	if	you	want	to	learn	about	the	 micro 	 organism 	 s 	 	,	just	looking	at	them	in	a	 micro 	 scope 	 	is	not	sufficient	.
and	so	we	just	heard	about	the	dna	 s 	 equ 	 encing 	 	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	one	of	the	best	ways	to	look	at	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	and	to	understand	them	is	to	look	at	 the 	 ir 	 	dna	.
and	that	's	what	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	for	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	using	dna	 s 	 equ 	 encing 	 	,	 collect 	 ing 	 	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	from	 vari 	 ous 	 	 place 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	the	human	body	,	 read 	 ing 	 	the	dna	sequence	and	then	using	that	dna	 s 	 equ 	 encing 	 	to	tell	us	about	the	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	that	are	in	a	 part 	 icular 	 	place	.
and	what	's	 amaz 	 ing 	 	,	when	you	use	 th 	 is 	 	technology	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	looking	at	 human 	 s 	 	,	we	're	not	just	 cover 	 ed 	 	in	a	sea	of	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	.
there	are	 thousand 	 s 	 	 up 	 on 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	on	us	.
we	have	 million 	 s 	 	of	 gene 	 s 	 	of	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	in	our	human	microbiome	 cover 	 ing 	 	us	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	 micro 	 bi 	 al 	 	 divers 	 ity 	 	 differ 	 s 	 	between	people	,	and	what	people	have	 be 	 en 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	in	the	last	10	,	 may 	 be 	 	15	 year 	 s 	 	is	,	 may 	 be 	 	these	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 micro 	 bi 	 al 	 	cloud	in	and	on	us	,	and	the	 vari 	 ation 	 	between	us	,	may	be	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	some	of	the	health	and	 ill 	 ness 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	between	us	.
and	that	 come 	 s 	 	back	to	the	diabetes	story	i	was	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	people	now	think	that	one	of	the	 trigger 	 s 	 	for	type	1	diabetes	is	not	 fight 	 ing 	 	a	pathogen	,	but	is	in	fact	 try 	 ing 	 	to	--	miscommunicating	with	the	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	that	live	in	and	on	you	.
and	 some 	 how 	 	 may 	 be 	 	the	 micro 	 bi 	 al 	 	community	that	's	in	and	on	me	got	off	,	and	then	 th 	 is 	 	 trigger 	 ed 	 	some	sort	of	 immun 	 e 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	and	led	to	me	 kill 	 ing 	 	the	 cell 	 s 	 	that	make	insulin	in	my	body	.
and	so	what	i	want	to	tell	you	about	for	a	few	 minute 	 s 	 	is	,	what	people	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	using	dna	 s 	 equ 	 encing 	 	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	to	 stud 	 y 	 	the	 micro 	 bi 	 al 	 	cloud	that	 live 	 s 	 	in	and	on	us	.
and	i	want	to	tell	you	a	story	about	a	personal	project	.
my	first	personal	experience	with	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	the	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	on	the	human	body	 actual 	 ly 	 	came	from	a	talk	that	i	 g 	 ave 	 	,	right	around	the	corner	from	here	at	georgetown	.
i	 g 	 ave 	 	a	talk	,	and	a	family	friend	who	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	be	the	dean	of	georgetown	medical	school	was	at	the	talk	,	and	came	up	to	me	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	a	 stud 	 y 	 	of	ileal	 transplant 	 s 	 	in	people	.
and	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	look	at	the	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	after	the	 transplant 	 s 	 	.
and	so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	a	 collabor 	 ation 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	person	,	michael	zasloff	and	thomas	fishbein	,	to	look	at	the	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	that	 colon 	 ized 	 	these	ilea	after	they	 we 	 re 	 	 transplant 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	recipient	.
and	i	can	tell	you	all	the	 detail 	 s 	 	about	the	 micro 	 bi 	 al 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	that	we	did	there	,	but	the	reason	i	want	to	tell	you	 th 	 is 	 	story	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 tri 	 king 	 	that	they	did	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	project	.
they	take	the	donor	ileum	,	which	is	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	from	a	donor	and	they	have	a	recipient	who	might	have	a	problem	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 micro 	 bi 	 al 	 	community	,	say	crohn	's	disease	,	and	they	 steril 	 ized 	 	the	donor	ileum	.
 clean 	 ed 	 	out	all	the	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	,	and	then	put	it	in	the	recipient	.
they	did	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	was	common	practice	in	medicine	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	it	was	obvious	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	not	a	good	idea	.
and	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	in	the	course	of	 th 	 is 	 	project	,	the	transplant	 surgeon 	 s 	 	and	the	other	people	 decide 	 d 	 	,	forget	common	practice	.	we	have	to	 s 	 witch 	 	.
so	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 witch 	 ed 	 	to	 leav 	 ing 	 	some	of	the	 micro 	 bi 	 al 	 	community	in	the	ileum	.	they	 leav 	 e 	 	the	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	with	the	donor	,	and	 theoretic 	 ally 	 	that	might	help	the	people	who	are	 receiv 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	ileal	transplant	.
and	so	,	people	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 stud 	 y 	 	that	i	did	now	.
in	the	last	few	 year 	 s 	 	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	great	expansion	in	using	dna	technology	to	 stud 	 y 	 	the	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	in	and	on	people	.
there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	human	microbiome	project	that	's	going	on	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	and	metahit	going	on	in	europe	,	and	a	lot	of	other	 project 	 s 	 	.
and	when	people	have	 d 	 one 	 	a	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 stud 	 ies 	 	,	they	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	,	when	a	baby	is	born	,	 dur 	 ing 	 	vaginal	 deliver 	 y 	 	you	get	 colon 	 ized 	 	by	the	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	from	your	mother	.
there	are	risk	 factor 	 s 	 	 associate 	 d 	 	with	cesarean	 section 	 s 	 	,	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	risk	 factor 	 s 	 	may	be	due	to	mis	-	 colon 	 ization 	 	when	you	carve	a	baby	out	of	 it 	 s 	 	mother	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 be 	 ing 	 	 deliver 	 ed 	 	through	the	birth	 can 	 al 	 	.
and	a	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	other	 stud 	 ies 	 	have	 show 	 n 	 	that	the	 micro 	 bi 	 al 	 	community	that	 live 	 s 	 	in	and	on	us	 help 	 s 	 	in	 develop 	 ment 	 	of	the	 immun 	 e 	 	system	,	 help 	 s 	 	in	 fight 	 ing 	 	off	 pathogen 	 s 	 	,	 help 	 s 	 	in	our	 metabol 	 ism 	 	,	and	 determi 	 ning 	 	our	 metabol 	 ic 	 	rate	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	 determine 	 s 	 	our	odor	,	and	may	even	shape	our	behavior	in	a	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	ways	.
and	so	,	these	 stud 	 ies 	 	have	 document 	 ed 	 	or	 suggest 	 ed 	 	out	of	a	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 import 	 ant 	 	 function 	 s 	 	for	the	 micro 	 bi 	 al 	 	community	,	 th 	 is 	 	cloud	,	the	non	-	 pathogen 	 s 	 	that	live	in	and	on	us	.
and	one	area	that	i	think	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	which	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	may	have	now	that	we	've	 throw 	 n 	 	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	crowd	,	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	would	call	``	germophobia	.	``	so	people	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 clean 	 lines 	 s 	 	,	right	?
we	have	 anti 	 biotic 	 s 	 	in	our	kitchen	 counter 	 s 	 	,	people	are	 wash 	 ing 	 	every	part	of	them	all	of	the	time	,	we	pump	 anti 	 biotic 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	our	food	,	 in 	 to 	 	our	 commun 	 ities 	 	,	we	take	 anti 	 biotic 	 s 	 	 excess 	 ively 	 	.
and	 kill 	 ing 	 	 pathogen 	 s 	 	is	a	good	thing	if	you	're	sick	,	but	we	should	understand	that	when	we	pump	 chemical 	 s 	 	and	 anti 	 biotic 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	our	world	,	that	we	're	 al 	 so 	 	 kill 	 ing 	 	the	cloud	of	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	that	live	in	and	on	us	.
and	 excess 	 ive 	 	use	of	 anti 	 biotic 	 s 	 	,	in	 part 	 icular 	 	in	children	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 show 	 n 	 	to	be	 associate 	 d 	 	with	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	risk	 factor 	 s 	 	for	 obes 	 ity 	 	,	for	 auto 	 immun 	 e 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	,	for	a	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 problem 	 s 	 	that	are	 prob 	 ably 	 	due	to	 disrupt 	 ion 	 	of	the	 micro 	 bi 	 al 	 	community	.
so	the	 micro 	 bi 	 al 	 	community	can	go	wrong	 whet 	 her 	 	we	want	it	to	or	not	,	or	we	can	kill	it	with	 anti 	 biotic 	 s 	 	,	but	what	can	we	do	to	 re 	 store 	 	it	?
i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	here	have	heard	about	probiotics	.
probiotics	are	one	thing	that	you	can	try	and	do	to	 re 	 store 	 	the	 micro 	 bi 	 al 	 	community	that	is	in	and	on	you	.
and	they	 definite 	 ly 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 show 	 n 	 	to	be	effective	in	some	 case 	 s 	 	.
there	's	a	project	going	on	at	uc	davis	where	people	are	using	probiotics	to	try	and	treat	,	prevent	,	necrotizing	enterocolitis	in	 pre 	 mature 	 	 infant 	 s 	 	.
 pre 	 mature 	 	 infant 	 s 	 	have	real	 problem 	 s 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 micro 	 bi 	 al 	 	community	.
and	it	may	be	that	probiotics	can	help	prevent	the	 develop 	 ment 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 horr 	 ible 	 	necrotizing	enterocolitis	in	these	 pre 	 mature 	 	 infant 	 s 	 	.
but	probiotics	are	sort	of	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	solution	.
most	of	the	 pill 	 s 	 	that	you	can	take	or	the	yogurts	that	you	can	eat	have	one	or	two	species	in	them	,	 may 	 be 	 	five	species	in	them	,	and	the	human	community	is	 thousand 	 s 	 	 up 	 on 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	species	.
so	what	can	we	do	to	 re 	 store 	 	our	 micro 	 bi 	 al 	 	community	when	we	have	 thousand 	 s 	 	and	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	species	on	us	?
well	,	one	thing	that	 animal 	 s 	 	seem	to	do	is	,	they	eat	poo	--	coprophagia	.
and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	 man 	 y 	 	 veterin 	 arian 	 s 	 	,	old	school	 veterin 	 arian 	 s 	 	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	have	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	``	poo	tea	,	``	not	booty	,	but	poo	tea	,	to	treat	colic	and	other	 ail 	 ments 	 	in	 horse 	 s 	 	and	 cow 	 s 	 	and	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	,	where	you	make	tea	from	the	poo	from	a	 health 	 y 	 	individual	animal	and	you	feed	it	to	a	sick	animal	.
 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	,	 un 	 less 	 	you	have	a	fistulated	cow	with	a	big	hole	in	 it 	 s 	 	side	,	and	you	can	put	your	hand	 in 	 to 	 	 it 	 s 	 	rumen	,	it	's	hard	to	imagine	that	the	 deliver 	 y 	 	of	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	 direct 	 ly 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	mouth	and	through	the	entire	top	of	the	 digest 	 ive 	 	tract	is	the	best	 deliver 	 y 	 	system	,	so	you	may	have	heard	in	people	they	are	now	 do 	 ing 	 	 fec 	 al 	 	 transplant 	 s 	 	,	where	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 deliver 	 ing 	 	a	couple	of	 pro 	 biotic 	 	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	through	the	mouth	,	they	are	 deliver 	 ing 	 	a	community	of	probiotics	,	a	community	of	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	from	a	 health 	 y 	 	donor	,	through	the	other	end	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	effective	in	 fight 	 ing 	 	certain	intransigent	 infect 	 ious 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	like	clostridium	difficile	 infect 	 ions 	 	that	can	stay	with	people	for	 year 	 s 	 	and	 year 	 s 	 	and	 year 	 s 	 	.
 transplant 	 s 	 	of	the	 fec 	 es 	 	,	of	the	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	from	the	 fec 	 es 	 	,	from	a	 health 	 y 	 	donor	 ha 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 show 	 n 	 	to	cure	 system 	 ic 	 	c.	dif	 infect 	 ions 	 	in	some	people	.
now	what	these	 transplant 	 s 	 	,	these	 fec 	 al 	 	 transplant 	 s 	 	,	or	the	poo	tea	suggest	to	me	,	and	 man 	 y 	 	other	people	have	come	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	same	idea	,	is	that	the	 micro 	 bi 	 al 	 	community	in	and	on	us	,	it	's	an	organ	.
we	should	view	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	 function 	 ing 	 	organ	,	part	of	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
we	should	treat	it	 care 	 fully 	 	and	with	respect	,	and	we	do	not	want	to	mess	with	it	,	say	by	c	-	 section 	 s 	 	or	by	 anti 	 biotic 	 s 	 	or	 excess 	 ive 	 	 clean 	 lines 	 s 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	some	real	good	justification	.
and	what	the	dna	 s 	 equ 	 encing 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	are	 allow 	 ing 	 	people	to	do	now	is	do	 detail 	 ed 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	of	,	say	,	100	 patient 	 s 	 	who	have	crohn	's	disease	and	100	people	who	do	n't	have	crohn	's	disease	.
or	100	people	who	took	 anti 	 biotic 	 s 	 	when	they	 we 	 re 	 	little	,	and	100	people	who	did	not	take	 anti 	 biotic 	 s 	 	.
and	we	can	now	start	to	 compar 	 e 	 	the	community	of	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 gene 	 s 	 	and	see	if	there	are	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	.
and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	we	may	be	able	to	understand	if	they	're	not	just	correlative	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	,	but	 caus 	 ative 	 	.
 stud 	 ies 	 	in	model	 system 	 s 	 	like	mouse	and	other	 animal 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 so 	 	 help 	 ing 	 	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	people	are	now	using	these	 techno 	 logies 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	've	gotten	 ver 	 y 	 	cheap	,	to	 stud 	 y 	 	the	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	in	and	on	a	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	people	.
so	,	in	 wrap 	 ping 	 	up	,	what	i	want	to	tell	you	about	is	,	i	did	n't	tell	you	a	part	of	the	story	of	coming	down	with	diabetes	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	my	father	was	an	m.d	.	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	 stud 	 ied 	 	 hormone 	 s 	 	.	i	told	him	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	that	i	was	 tire 	 d 	 	,	 thirst 	 y 	 	,	not	 feel 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	good	.
and	he	shrugged	it	off	,	i	think	he	either	thought	i	was	just	 complain 	 ing 	 	a	lot	,	or	it	was	the	typical	m.d.	``	 noth 	 ing 	 	can	be	wrong	with	my	children	.	``	we	even	went	to	the	 inter 	 national 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	of	endocrinology	 meet 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	family	in	quebec	.
and	i	was	 get 	 ting 	 	up	every	five	 minute 	 s 	 	to	 pe 	 e 	 	,	and	 drink 	 ing 	 	 every 	 body 	 	's	water	at	the	table	,	and	i	think	they	all	thought	i	was	a	druggie	.
but	the	reason	i	'm	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	the	medical	community	,	my	father	 a 	 s 	 	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	see	what	's	right	in	front	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	.
the	 micro 	 bi 	 al 	 	cloud	,	it	is	right	in	front	of	us	.
we	ca	n't	see	it	most	of	the	time	.	it	's	 in 	 visible 	 	.
they	're	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	.	they	're	 tin 	 y 	 	.
but	we	can	see	them	through	 the 	 ir 	 	dna	,	we	can	see	them	through	the	 effect 	 s 	 	that	they	have	on	people	.
and	what	we	need	now	is	to	start	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	 micro 	 bi 	 al 	 	community	in	the	 con 	 text 	 	of	 every 	 thing 	 	in	human	medicine	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	that	it	 affect 	 s 	 	every	part	of	us	,	but	it	might	.
what	we	need	is	a	full	field	guide	to	the	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	that	live	in	and	on	people	,	so	that	we	can	understand	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	to	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
we	are	them	.	they	are	us	.
thank	you	.
