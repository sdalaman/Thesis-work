all	you	have	to	do	is	read	what	you	see	.	right	?
so	,	i	'm	going	to	count	to	you	,	so	we	do	n't	all	do	it	together	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	one	,	two	,	three	.	audience	:	can	you	read	 th 	 is 	 	?

audience	:	what	are	you	 read 	 ing 	 	?
bl	:	what	are	you	 read 	 ing 	 	?	there	are	no	 word 	 s 	 	there	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	read	what	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	.	right	?
it	 liter 	 ally 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	wat	ar	ou	rea	in	?	``	right	?
that	's	what	you	should	have	 s 	 aid 	 	.	right	?	why	is	 th 	 is 	 	?
it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	 per 	 ception 	 	is	 ground 	 ed 	 	in	our	experience	.
right	?	the	brain	 take 	 s 	 	 meaning 	 less 	 	information	and	 make 	 s 	 	meaning	out	of	it	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	we	never	see	what	's	there	,	we	never	see	information	,	we	 on 	 ly 	 	ever	see	what	was	 use 	 ful 	 	to	see	in	the	past	.
all	right	?	which	 mean 	 s 	 	,	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	 per 	 ception 	 	,	we	're	all	like	 th 	 is 	 	frog	.
right	?	it	's	 get 	 ting 	 	information	.	it	's	generating	behavior	that	's	 use 	 ful 	 	.
man	:	ow	!	ow	!
bl	:	and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	when	 thing 	 s 	 	do	n't	go	our	way	,	we	get	a	little	bit	 annoy 	 ed 	 	,	right	?
but	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 per 	 ception 	 	here	,	right	?
and	 per 	 ception 	 	 under 	 pin 	 s 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	we	think	,	we	know	,	we	 believ 	 e 	 	,	our	 hope 	 s 	 	,	our	 dream 	 s 	 	,	the	 clothe 	 s 	 	we	wear	,	 fall 	 ing 	 	in	love	,	 every 	 thing 	 	 begin 	 s 	 	with	 per 	 ception 	 	.
now	if	 per 	 ception 	 	is	 ground 	 ed 	 	in	our	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	it	 mean 	 s 	 	we	're	 on 	 ly 	 	ever	 respond 	 ing 	 	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	what	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	before	.
but	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	a	tremendous	problem	,	 be 	 cause 	 	how	can	we	ever	see	 different 	 ly 	 	?
now	,	i	want	to	tell	you	a	story	about	 see 	 ing 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	,	and	all	new	 per 	 ception 	 s 	 	begin	in	the	same	way	.
they	begin	with	a	question	.
the	problem	with	 question 	 s 	 	is	they	create	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	.
now	,	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	bad	thing	.	it	's	 evolution 	 arily 	 	a	bad	thing	.	if	you	're	not	 s 	 ure 	 	that	's	a	predator	,	it	's	too	late	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
even	seasickness	is	a	 con 	 sequence 	 	of	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	.	right	?	if	you	go	down	 be 	 low 	 	on	a	boat	,	your	inner	 ear 	 s 	 	are	you	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	you	're	moving	.	your	 eye 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	moving	in	register	with	the	boat	,	say	i	'm	 stand 	 ing 	 	still	.
your	brain	can	not	deal	with	the	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	of	that	information	,	and	it	 get 	 s 	 	ill	.
the	question	``	why	?	``	is	one	of	the	most	 danger 	 ous 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	you	can	do	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 take 	 s 	 	you	 in 	 to 	 	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	.
and	yet	,	the	 iron 	 y 	 	is	,	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	we	can	ever	do	 any 	 thing 	 	new	is	to	step	 in 	 to 	 	that	space	.
so	how	can	we	ever	do	 any 	 thing 	 	new	?	well	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	evolution	 ha 	 s 	 	 give 	 n 	 	us	an	answer	,	right	?
and	it	 en 	 able 	 s 	 	us	to	address	even	the	most	difficult	they	're	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	question	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	think	to	be	true	 al 	 ready 	 	.	right	?
it	's	easy	to	ask	 question 	 s 	 	about	how	did	life	begin	,	or	what	 extend 	 s 	 	beyond	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	but	to	question	what	you	think	to	be	true	 al 	 ready 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 step 	 ping 	 	 in 	 to 	 	that	space	.
so	what	is	evolution	's	answer	to	the	problem	of	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	?
it	's	play	.
now	play	is	not	 simpl 	 y 	 	a	process	.	 expert 	 s 	 	in	play	will	tell	you	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	it	's	a	way	of	 be 	 ing 	 	.
play	is	one	of	the	 on 	 ly 	 	human	 endeavor 	 s 	 	where	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 celebr 	 ated 	 	.	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	is	what	 make 	 s 	 	play	 f 	 un 	 	.
right	?	it	's	 adapt 	 able 	 	to	change	.	right	?	it	 open 	 s 	 	 possibil 	 ity 	 	,	and	it	's	 co 	 operative 	 	.	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	how	we	do	our	social	 bond 	 ing 	 	,	and	it	's	 intrinsic 	 ally 	 	 motiv 	 ated 	 	.	what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	is	that	we	play	to	play	.	play	is	 it 	 s 	 	own	reward	.
now	if	you	look	at	these	five	ways	of	 be 	 ing 	 	,	these	are	the	exact	same	ways	of	 be 	 ing 	 	you	need	in	order	to	be	a	good	scientist	.
science	is	not	defined	by	the	method	section	of	a	paper	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	way	of	 be 	 ing 	 	,	which	is	here	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	true	for	 any 	 thing 	 	that	is	creative	.
so	if	you	add	 rule 	 s 	 	to	play	,	you	have	a	game	.
that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	what	an	experiment	is	.
so	 arm 	 ed 	 	with	these	two	 idea 	 s 	 	,	that	science	is	a	way	of	 be 	 ing 	 	and	 experiment 	 s 	 	are	play	,	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	can	 any 	 one 	 	 be 	 come 	 	a	scientist	?
and	who	better	to	ask	than	25	eight	-	to	10	-	year	-	old	children	?
 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 expert 	 s 	 	in	play	.	so	i	took	my	bee	arena	down	to	a	small	school	in	devon	,	and	the	aim	of	 th 	 is 	 	was	to	not	just	get	the	 kid 	 s 	 	to	see	science	 different 	 ly 	 	,	but	,	through	the	process	of	science	,	to	see	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	.	right	?
the	first	step	was	to	ask	a	question	.
now	,	i	should	say	that	we	did	n't	get	 fund 	 ing 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 scientist 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	small	children	could	n't	make	a	 use 	 ful 	 	 con 	 trib 	 ution 	 	to	science	,	and	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	could	n't	do	it	.
so	we	did	it	 any 	 way 	 	.	right	?	of	course	.
so	,	here	are	some	of	the	 question 	 s 	 	.	i	put	them	in	small	print	so	you	would	n't	 both 	 er 	 	 read 	 ing 	 	it	.	point	is	that	five	of	the	 question 	 s 	 	that	the	 kid 	 s 	 	came	up	with	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	science	 public 	 ation 	 	the	last	five	to	15	 year 	 s 	 	.	right	?
so	they	 we 	 re 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	 question 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	significant	to	expert	 scientist 	 s 	 	.
now	here	,	i	want	to	share	the	stage	with	 some 	 one 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	special	.	right	?
she	was	one	of	the	young	people	who	was	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	,	and	she	's	now	one	of	the	 young 	 est 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	 scientist 	 s 	 	in	the	world	.	right	?	she	will	now	,	once	she	 come 	 s 	 	onto	stage	,	will	be	the	 young 	 est 	 	person	to	ever	speak	at	ted	.	right	?
now	,	science	and	 ask 	 ing 	 	 question 	 s 	 	is	about	courage	.
now	she	is	the	personification	of	courage	,	 be 	 cause 	 	she	's	going	to	stand	up	here	and	talk	to	you	all	.
so	amy	,	would	you	 pleas 	 e 	 	come	up	?
so	amy	's	going	to	help	me	tell	the	story	of	what	we	call	the	blackawton	bees	project	,	and	first	she	's	going	to	tell	you	the	question	that	they	came	up	with	.	so	go	 a 	 head 	 	,	amy	.
amy	o'toole	:	thank	you	,	beau	.	we	thought	that	it	was	easy	to	see	the	link	between	 human 	 s 	 	and	 ape 	 s 	 	in	the	way	that	we	think	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	look	 a 	 like 	 	.
but	we	 wonder 	 ed 	 	if	there	's	a	possible	link	with	other	 animal 	 s 	 	.	it	'd	be	 amaz 	 ing 	 	if	 human 	 s 	 	and	bees	thought	similar	,	since	they	seem	so	different	from	us	.
so	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	if	 human 	 s 	 	and	bees	might	solve	complex	 problem 	 s 	 	in	the	same	way	.
 re 	 ally 	 	,	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	know	if	bees	can	 al 	 so 	 	adapt	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	new	 situ 	 ations 	 	using	 previous 	 ly 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	 rule 	 s 	 	and	 condition 	 s 	 	.	so	what	if	bees	can	think	like	us	?
well	,	it	'd	be	 amaz 	 ing 	 	,	since	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	an	insect	with	 on 	 ly 	 	one	million	brain	 cell 	 s 	 	.
but	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 make 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	sense	they	should	,	 be 	 cause 	 	bees	,	like	us	,	can	 recogn 	 ize 	 	a	good	flower	 regard 	 less 	 	of	the	time	of	day	,	the	light	,	the	weather	,	or	from	any	angle	they	approach	it	from	.
bl	:	so	the	next	step	was	to	design	an	experiment	,	which	is	a	game	.	so	the	 kid 	 s 	 	went	off	and	they	designed	 th 	 is 	 	experiment	,	and	so	--	well	,	game	--	and	so	,	amy	,	can	you	tell	us	what	the	game	was	,	and	the	 puzzl 	 e 	 	that	you	set	the	bees	?
ao	:	the	 puzzl 	 e 	 	we	came	up	with	was	an	if	-	then	rule	.
we	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	bees	to	learn	not	just	to	go	to	a	certain	color	,	but	to	a	certain	color	flower	 on 	 ly 	 	when	it	's	in	a	certain	pattern	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 reward 	 ed 	 	if	they	went	to	the	yellow	 flower 	 s 	 	if	the	yellow	 flower 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 surround 	 ed 	 	by	the	blue	,	or	if	the	blue	 flower 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 surround 	 ed 	 	by	the	yellow	.
now	there	's	a	number	of	different	 rule 	 s 	 	the	bees	can	learn	to	solve	 th 	 is 	 	 puzzl 	 e 	 	.	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	question	is	,	which	?
what	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	project	was	we	,	and	beau	,	had	no	idea	 whet 	 her 	 	it	would	work	.
it	was	 complete 	 ly 	 	new	,	and	no	one	had	 d 	 one 	 	it	before	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 adult 	 s 	 	.
bl	:	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	,	and	that	was	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	for	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	.
it	's	easy	for	a	scientist	to	go	in	and	not	have	a	clue	what	he	's	 do 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	what	we	do	in	the	lab	,	but	for	a	teacher	not	to	know	what	's	going	to	happen	at	the	end	of	the	day	--	so	much	of	the	credit	 go 	 es 	 	to	dave	strudwick	,	who	was	the	 collabor 	 ator 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	project	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
so	i	'm	not	going	to	go	through	the	whole	 detail 	 s 	 	of	the	 stud 	 y 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	you	can	read	about	it	,	but	the	next	step	is	 observ 	 ation 	 	.	so	here	are	some	of	the	 student 	 s 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	the	 observ 	 ations 	 	.	they	're	 record 	 ing 	 	the	data	of	where	the	bees	fly	.
dave	strudwick	:	so	what	we	're	going	to	do	--	student	:	5c	.
dave	strudwick	:	is	she	still	going	up	here	?	student	:	 yea 	 h 	 	.
dave	strudwick	:	so	you	keep	track	of	each	.	student	:	henry	,	can	you	help	me	here	?
bl	:	``	can	you	help	me	,	henry	?	``	what	good	scientist	 say 	 s 	 	that	,	right	?
student	:	there	's	two	up	there	.
and	three	in	here	.
bl	:	right	?	so	we	've	got	our	 observ 	 ations 	 	.	we	've	got	our	data	.
they	do	the	simple	 mathematic 	 s 	 	,	 ave 	 rag 	 ing 	 	,	etc	.	,	etc	.
and	now	we	want	to	share	.	that	's	the	next	step	.
so	we	're	going	to	write	 th 	 is 	 	up	and	try	to	submit	 th 	 is 	 
for	 public 	 ation 	 	.	right	?	so	we	have	to	write	it	up	.
so	we	go	,	of	course	,	to	the	pub	.	all	right	?
the	one	on	the	left	is	mine	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
now	,	i	tell	them	,	a	paper	 ha 	 s 	 	four	different	 section 	 s 	 	:	an	 introduc 	 tion 	 	,	a	 method 	 s 	 	,	a	 result 	 s 	 	,	a	 discuss 	 ion 	 	.
the	 introduc 	 tion 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	what	's	the	question	and	why	?
 method 	 s 	 	,	what	did	you	do	?	 result 	 s 	 	,	what	was	the	 observ 	 ation 	 	?
and	the	 discuss 	 ion 	 	is	,	who	 care 	 s 	 	?	right	?
that	's	a	science	paper	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	.
so	the	 kid 	 s 	 	give	me	the	 word 	 s 	 	,	right	?	i	put	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	narrative	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	paper	is	written	in	kidspeak	.
it	's	not	written	by	me	.	it	's	written	by	amy	and	the	other	 student 	 s 	 	in	the	class	.	 a 	 s 	 	a	 con 	 sequence 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	science	paper	 begin 	 s 	 	,	``	once	 up 	 on 	 	a	time	...	``	the	 result 	 s 	 	section	,	it	 say 	 s 	 	:	``	training	phase	,	the	 puzzl 	 e 	 	...	 d 	 uh 	 	 d 	 uh 	 	duuuuuhhh	.	``	right	?
and	the	 method 	 s 	 	,	it	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	then	we	put	the	bees	 in 	 to 	 	the	 f 	 ridge 	 	,	``	smiley	face	.	right	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	science	paper	.	we	're	going	to	try	to	get	it	 publish 	 ed 	 	.
so	here	's	the	title	page	.	we	have	a	number	of	 author 	 s 	 	there	.
all	the	 one 	 s 	 	in	bold	are	eight	to	10	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
the	first	author	is	blackawton	 prim 	 ary 	 	school	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	it	 we 	 re 	 	ever	 re 	 ference 	 d 	 	,	it	would	be	``	blackawton	et	al	,	``	and	not	one	individual	.	so	we	submit	it	to	a	public	access	journal	,	and	it	 say 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.	it	 s 	 aid 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	but	it	 s 	 aid 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
``	i	'm	 af 	 raid 	 	the	paper	 fail 	 s 	 	our	 initi 	 al 	 	quality	control	 check 	 s 	 	in	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	different	ways	.	``	in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	it	 start 	 s 	 	off	``	once	 up 	 on 	 	a	time	,	``	the	 figure 	 s 	 	are	in	 cray 	 on 	 	,	etc	.
so	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	we	'll	get	it	 review 	 ed 	 	.	so	i	 s 	 ent 	 	it	to	dale	purves	,	who	is	at	the	national	academy	of	science	,	one	of	the	 lead 	 ing 	 	 neuro 	 scientist 	 s 	 	in	the	world	,	and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	most	original	science	paper	i	have	ever	read	``	--	--	``	and	it	 certain 	 ly 	 	 deserve 	 s 	 	wide	 expo 	 s 	 ure 	 	.	``	larry	maloney	,	expert	in	vision	,	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	the	paper	is	 magnific 	 ent 	 	.
the	work	would	be	publishable	if	 d 	 one 	 	by	 adult 	 s 	 	.	``	so	what	did	we	do	?	we	 s 	 end 	 	it	back	to	the	editor	.
they	say	no	.
so	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	larry	and	natalie	hempel	to	write	a	 comment 	 ary 	 	situating	the	 find 	 ing 	 s 	 	for	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	right	,	 put 	 ting 	 	in	the	 re 	 ference 	 s 	 	,	and	we	submit	it	to	biology	 letter 	 s 	 	.
and	there	,	it	was	 review 	 ed 	 	by	five	 in 	 dependent 	 	 refer 	 ees 	 	,	and	it	was	 publish 	 ed 	 	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
it	took	four	 month 	 s 	 	to	do	the	science	,	two	 year 	 s 	 	to	get	it	 publish 	 ed 	 	.
typical	science	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	right	?	so	 th 	 is 	 	 make 	 s 	 	amy	and	her	 friend 	 s 	 	the	 young 	 est 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	 scientist 	 s 	 	in	the	world	.
what	was	the	 feed 	 back 	 	like	?
well	,	it	was	 publish 	 ed 	 	two	 day 	 s 	 	before	christmas	,	 download 	 ed 	 	30,000	 time 	 s 	 	in	the	first	day	,	right	?
it	was	the	 editor 	 s 	 	'	choice	in	science	,	which	is	a	top	science	magazine	.
it	's	 fore 	 ver 	 	 free 	 ly 	 	 access 	 ible 	 	by	biology	 letter 	 s 	 	.
it	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	paper	that	will	ever	be	 free 	 ly 	 	 access 	 ible 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	journal	.
last	year	,	it	was	the	second	-	most	 download 	 ed 	 	paper	by	biology	 letter 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 feed 	 back 	 	from	not	just	 scientist 	 s 	 	and	 teacher 	 s 	 	but	the	public	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
and	i	'll	just	read	one	.

now	,	science	is	about	taking	 risk 	 s 	 	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 in 	 credible 	 	risk	,	right	?
for	me	,	not	for	him	.	right	?	 be 	 cause 	 	we	've	 on 	 ly 	 	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	once	before	.
and	you	like	technology	,	right	?
shimon	schocken	:	right	,	but	i	like	 my 	 self 	 	.
bl	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 epit 	 ome 	 	of	technology	.	right	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
now	...
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
now	,	we	're	going	to	do	a	little	 demonst 	 ration 	 	,	right	?
you	have	to	close	your	 eye 	 s 	 	,	and	you	have	to	point	where	you	hear	me	 clap 	 ping 	 	.	all	right	?
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	how	about	if	 every 	 one 	 	over	there	 shout 	 s 	 	.	one	,	two	,	three	?
audience	:	 brilli 	 ant 	 	.	now	,	open	your	 eye 	 s 	 	.	we	'll	do	it	one	more	time	.
 every 	 one 	 	over	there	shout	.
where	's	the	sound	coming	from	?
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
what	's	the	point	?	the	point	is	what	science	 do 	 es 	 	for	us	.
right	?	we	 normal 	 ly 	 	walk	through	life	 respond 	 ing 	 	,	but	if	we	ever	want	to	do	 any 	 thing 	 	different	,	we	have	to	step	 in 	 to 	 	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	.	when	he	 open 	 ed 	 	his	 eye 	 s 	 	,	he	was	able	to	see	the	world	in	a	new	way	.
that	's	what	science	 off 	 ers 	 	us	.	it	 off 	 ers 	 	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	to	step	on	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	through	the	process	of	play	,	right	?
now	,	true	science	education	i	think	should	be	about	giving	people	a	voice	and	 enabl 	 ing 	 	to	express	that	voice	,	so	i	've	 ask 	 ed 	 	amy	to	be	the	last	voice	in	 th 	 is 	 	short	story	.
so	,	amy	?
ao	:	 th 	 is 	 	project	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	for	me	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 br 	 ought 	 	the	process	of	 discover 	 y 	 	to	life	,	and	it	 show 	 ed 	 	me	that	 any 	 one 	 	,	and	i	mean	 any 	 one 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	the	potential	to	discover	 some 	 thing 	 	new	,	and	that	a	small	question	can	lead	 in 	 to 	 	a	big	 discover 	 y 	 	.
changing	the	way	a	person	 think 	 s 	 	about	 some 	 thing 	 	can	be	easy	or	hard	.	it	all	 depend 	 s 	 	on	the	way	the	person	 feel 	 s 	 	about	change	.
but	changing	the	way	i	thought	about	science	was	 surprising 	 ly 	 	easy	.	once	we	 play 	 ed 	 	the	 game 	 s 	 	and	then	 start 	 ed 	 	to	think	about	the	 puzzl 	 e 	 	,	i	then	 real 	 ized 	 	that	science	is	n't	just	a	 bor 	 ing 	 	subject	,	and	that	 any 	 one 	 	can	discover	 some 	 thing 	 	new	.
you	just	need	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.	my	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	came	in	the	form	of	beau	,	and	the	blackawton	bee	project	.
thank	you	.	bl	:	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
