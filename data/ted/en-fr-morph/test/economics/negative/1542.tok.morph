in	half	a	century	of	 try 	 ing 	 	to	help	prevent	 war 	 s 	 	,	there	's	one	question	that	never	 leav 	 es 	 	me	:	how	do	we	deal	with	 extrem 	 e 	 	violence	 with 	 out 	 	using	force	in	return	?
when	you	're	 face 	 d 	 	with	 brutal 	 ity 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	a	child	facing	a	 bull 	 y 	 	on	a	 play 	 ground 	 	or	domestic	violence	--	or	,	on	the	 street 	 s 	 	of	syria	 to 	 day 	 	,	facing	 tank 	 s 	 	and	shrapnel	,	what	's	the	most	effective	thing	to	do	?
fight	back	?	give	in	?
use	more	force	?
 th 	 is 	 	question	:	``	how	do	i	deal	with	a	 bull 	 y 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 be 	 coming 	 	a	thug	in	return	?	``	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	with	me	ever	since	i	was	a	child	.
i	remember	i	was	about	13	,	 glu 	 ed 	 	to	a	 grain 	 y 	 	black	and	white	 tele 	 vision 	 	in	my	 parent 	 s 	 	'	living	room	 a 	 s 	 	soviet	 tank 	 s 	 	 roll 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	budapest	,	and	 kid 	 s 	 	not	much	 old 	 er 	 	than	me	 we 	 re 	 	 throw 	 ing 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	at	the	 tank 	 s 	 	and	 get 	 ting 	 	mown	down	.
and	i	 rush 	 ed 	 	 up 	 stair 	 s 	 	and	 start 	 ed 	 	 pack 	 ing 	 	my	 suit 	 case 	 	.
and	my	mother	came	up	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	on	earth	are	you	 do 	 ing 	 	?	``	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'm	going	to	budapest	.	``	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	on	earth	for	?	``	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 kid 	 s 	 	are	 get 	 ting 	 	 kill 	 ed 	 	there	.
there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	 terr 	 ible 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	.	``	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	do	n't	be	so	 s 	 il 	 ly 	 	.	``	and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	cry	.
and	she	got	it	,	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	i	see	it	's	serious	.
you	're	much	too	young	to	help	.
you	need	training	.	i	'll	help	you	.
but	just	 un 	 pack 	 	your	 suit 	 case 	 	.	``	and	so	i	got	some	training	and	went	and	 work 	 ed 	 	in	africa	 dur 	 ing 	 	most	of	my	20s	.
but	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	what	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	to	know	i	could	n't	get	from	training	 course 	 s 	 	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	understand	how	violence	,	how	 oppress 	 ion 	 	,	 work 	 s 	 	.
and	what	i	've	 discover 	 ed 	 	since	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	 bull 	 ies 	 	use	violence	in	three	ways	.
they	use	 politic 	 al 	 	violence	to	 intimid 	 ate 	 	,	physical	violence	to	 terror 	 ize 	 	and	mental	or	 emotion 	 al 	 	violence	to	 under 	 mine 	 	.
and	 on 	 ly 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 rare 	 ly 	 	in	 ver 	 y 	 	few	 case 	 s 	 	 do 	 es 	 	it	work	to	use	more	violence	.
nelson	mandela	went	to	jail	 believ 	 ing 	 	in	violence	,	and	27	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	he	and	his	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	had	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	and	 care 	 fully 	 	 hon 	 ed 	 	the	 skill 	 s 	 	,	the	 in 	 credible 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	,	that	they	 need 	 ed 	 	to	turn	one	of	the	most	 vic 	 ious 	 	 government 	 s 	 	the	world	 ha 	 s 	 	known	 in 	 to 	 	a	 demo 	 cracy 	 	.
and	they	did	it	in	a	total	devotion	to	non	-	violence	.
they	 real 	 ized 	 	that	using	force	against	force	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	.
so	what	 do 	 es 	 	work	?
over	time	i	've	 collect 	 ed 	 	about	a	half	-	dozen	 method 	 s 	 	that	do	work	--	of	course	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	more	--	that	do	work	and	that	are	effective	.
and	the	first	is	that	the	change	that	 ha 	 s 	 	to	take	place	 ha 	 s 	 	to	take	place	here	,	 in 	 side 	 	me	.
it	's	my	 respons 	 e 	 	,	my	attitude	,	to	 oppress 	 ion 	 	that	i	've	got	control	over	,	and	that	i	can	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	.
and	what	i	need	to	develop	is	self	-	knowledge	to	do	that	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	i	need	to	know	how	i	tick	,	when	i	collapse	,	where	my	 for 	 mid 	 able 	 	 point 	 s 	 	are	,	where	my	 weak 	 er 	 	 point 	 s 	 	are	.
when	do	i	give	in	?
what	will	i	stand	up	for	?
and	 medit 	 ation 	 	or	self	-	 inspect 	 ion 	 	is	one	of	the	ways	--	 aga 	 in 	 	it	's	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	one	--	it	's	one	of	the	ways	of	 gain 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	inner	power	.
and	my	 hero 	 ine 	 	here	--	like	satish	's	--	is	aung	san	suu	kyi	in	burma	.
she	was	 lead 	 ing 	 	a	group	of	 student 	 s 	 	on	a	protest	in	the	 street 	 s 	 	of	rangoon	.
they	came	around	a	corner	 face 	 d 	 	with	a	row	of	machine	 gun 	 s 	 	.
and	she	 real 	 ized 	 	straight	away	that	the	 soldier 	 s 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 finger 	 s 	 	 sha 	 king 	 	on	the	 trigger 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	more	 scar 	 ed 	 	than	the	student	 protest 	 ers 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	her	.
but	she	told	the	 student 	 s 	 	to	 s 	 it 	 	down	.
and	she	 walk 	 ed 	 	forward	with	 s 	 uch 	 	calm	and	 s 	 uch 	 	 clar 	 ity 	 	and	 s 	 uch 	 	total	lack	of	fear	that	she	could	walk	right	up	to	the	first	gun	,	put	her	hand	on	it	and	lower	it	.
and	no	one	got	 kill 	 ed 	 	.
so	that	's	what	the	 master 	 y 	 	of	fear	can	do	--	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 face 	 d 	 	with	machine	 gun 	 s 	 	,	but	if	you	meet	a	knife	fight	in	the	street	.
but	we	have	to	practice	.
so	what	about	our	fear	?
i	have	a	little	 man 	 tra 	 	.
my	fear	 grow 	 s 	 	fat	on	the	energy	i	feed	it	.
and	if	it	 grow 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	big	it	 prob 	 ably 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	.
so	we	all	know	the	three	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	syndrome	,	when	 some 	 thing 	 	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	 worry 	 ing 	 	about	 wake 	 s 	 	you	up	--	i	see	a	lot	of	people	--	and	for	an	hour	you	 to 	 s 	 s 	 	and	turn	,	it	 get 	 s 	 	 wo 	 rse 	 	and	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	and	by	four	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	you	're	pinned	to	the	 pil 	 low 	 	by	a	 mon 	 ster 	 	 th 	 is 	 	big	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	to	do	is	to	get	up	,	make	a	cup	of	tea	and	 s 	 it 	 	down	with	the	fear	like	a	child	 be 	 side 	 	you	.
you	're	the	adult	.
the	fear	is	the	child	.
and	you	talk	to	the	fear	and	you	ask	it	what	it	 want 	 s 	 	,	what	it	 need 	 s 	 	.
how	can	 th 	 is 	 	be	made	better	?
how	can	the	child	feel	 strong 	 er 	 	?
and	you	make	a	plan	.
and	you	say	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	now	we	're	going	back	to	sleep	.
half	-	past	seven	,	we	're	 get 	 ting 	 	up	and	that	's	what	we	're	going	to	do	.	``
i	had	one	of	these	3	 a.m 	 . 	 	 episode 	 s 	 	on	sunday	--	 paralyze 	 d 	 	with	fear	at	coming	to	talk	to	you	.
so	i	did	the	thing	.
i	got	up	,	made	the	cup	of	tea	,	 s 	 at 	 	down	with	it	,	did	it	all	and	i	'm	here	--	still	 part 	 ly 	 	 paralyze 	 d 	 	,	but	i	'm	here	.
so	that	's	fear	.	what	about	anger	?
 where 	 ver 	 	there	is	 in 	 justice 	 	there	's	anger	.
but	anger	is	like	 gas 	 o 	 line 	 	,	and	if	you	spray	it	around	and	 some 	 body 	 	 light 	 s 	 	a	match	,	you	've	got	an	inferno	.
but	anger	 a 	 s 	 	an	engine	--	in	an	engine	--	is	 power 	 ful 	 	.
if	we	can	put	our	anger	 in 	 side 	 	an	engine	,	it	can	drive	us	forward	,	it	can	get	us	through	the	 dread 	 ful 	 	 moment 	 s 	 	and	it	can	give	us	real	inner	power	.
and	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	my	work	with	nuclear	weapon	policy	-	makers	.
 be 	 cause 	 	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	i	was	so	 out 	 rag 	 ed 	 	at	the	 danger 	 s 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 ex 	 posing 	 	us	to	that	i	just	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 argu 	 e 	 	and	blame	and	make	them	wrong	.
 total 	 ly 	 	 in 	 effective 	 	.
in	order	to	develop	a	 dial 	 ogue 	 	for	change	we	have	to	deal	with	our	anger	.
it	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	to	be	 ang 	 ry 	 	with	the	thing	--	the	nuclear	 weapon 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	--	but	it	is	 hope 	 less 	 	to	be	 ang 	 ry 	 	with	the	people	.
they	are	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	just	like	us	.
and	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	what	they	think	is	best	.
and	that	's	the	 bas 	 is 	 	on	which	we	have	to	talk	with	them	.
so	that	's	the	third	one	,	anger	.
and	it	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	me	to	the	crux	of	what	's	going	on	,	or	what	i	perceive	 a 	 s 	 	going	on	,	in	the	world	 to 	 day 	 	,	which	is	that	last	century	was	top	-	down	power	.
it	was	still	 government 	 s 	 	 tell 	 ing 	 	people	what	to	do	.
 th 	 is 	 	century	there	's	a	shift	.
it	's	bottom	-	up	or	 grass 	 root 	 s 	 	power	.
it	's	like	 mushroom 	 s 	 	coming	through	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	.
it	's	people	 join 	 ing 	 	up	with	people	,	 a 	 s 	 	bundy	just	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 mile 	 s 	 	away	to	 br 	 ing 	 	about	change	.
and	peace	direct	 spot 	 ted 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	early	on	that	local	people	in	 area 	 s 	 	of	 ver 	 y 	 	hot	conflict	know	what	to	do	.
they	know	best	what	to	do	.
so	peace	direct	 get 	 s 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	them	to	do	that	.
and	the	kind	of	thing	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	is	demobilizing	militias	,	 re 	 building 	 	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	,	resettling	 refuge 	 es 	 	,	even	 liber 	 ating 	 	child	 soldier 	 s 	 	.
and	they	have	to	risk	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	 al 	 most 	 	every	day	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	what	they	've	 real 	 ized 	 	is	that	using	violence	in	the	 situ 	 ations 	 	they	 oper 	 ate 	 	in	is	not	 on 	 ly 	 	less	 human 	 e 	 	,	but	it	's	less	effective	than	using	 method 	 s 	 	that	connect	people	with	people	,	that	 re 	 build 	 	.
and	i	think	that	the	u.s.	 militar 	 y 	 	is	 final 	 ly 	 	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	get	 th 	 is 	 	.
up	to	now	 the 	 ir 	 	counter	-	 terror 	 ism 	 	policy	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	to	kill	 insurgent 	 s 	 	at	 al 	 most 	 	any	cost	,	and	if	 civil 	 ians 	 	get	in	the	way	,	that	's	written	 a 	 s 	 	``	 col 	 lateral 	 	damage	.	``
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	so	infuriating	and	 humil 	 i 	 ating 	 	for	the	population	of	afghanistan	,	that	it	 make 	 s 	 	the	 recruit 	 ment 	 	for	al-qaeda	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	,	when	people	are	so	disgusted	by	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	the	 burn 	 ing 	 	of	the	koran	.
so	the	training	of	the	 troop 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	change	.
and	i	think	there	are	 sign 	 s 	 	that	it	is	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	change	.
the	british	 militar 	 y 	 	have	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	much	better	at	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	there	is	one	 magnific 	 ent 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	for	them	to	take	 the 	 ir 	 	cue	from	,	and	that	's	a	 brilli 	 ant 	 	u.s.	lieutenant	colonel	 call 	 ed 	 	chris	hughes	.
and	he	was	 lead 	 ing 	 	his	men	down	the	 street 	 s 	 	of	najaf	--	in	 ir 	 aq 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	and	 sudden 	 ly 	 	people	 we 	 re 	 	 pour 	 ing 	 	out	of	the	 house 	 s 	 	on	either	side	of	the	road	,	 s 	 cream 	 ing 	 	,	 yell 	 ing 	 	,	 fur 	 iously 	 	 ang 	 ry 	 	,	and	 surround 	 ed 	 	these	 ver 	 y 	 	young	 troop 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	 terr 	 ified 	 	,	did	n't	know	what	was	going	on	,	could	n't	speak	arabic	.
and	chris	hughes	strode	 in 	 to 	 	the	middle	of	the	throng	with	his	weapon	above	his	head	,	 point 	 ing 	 	at	the	ground	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	kneel	.	``	and	these	huge	 soldier 	 s 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 back 	 pack 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	body	 arm 	 or 	 	,	wobbled	to	the	ground	.
and	complete	silence	fell	.
and	after	about	two	 minute 	 s 	 	,	 every 	 body 	 	 move 	 d 	 	 a 	 side 	 	and	went	home	.
now	that	to	me	is	 wis 	 dom 	 	in	action	.
in	the	moment	,	that	's	what	he	did	.
and	it	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	 every 	 where 	 	now	.
you	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	me	?
have	you	 ask 	 ed 	 	 your 	 s 	 elves 	 	why	and	how	so	 man 	 y 	 	 dictator 	 ship 	 s 	 	have	 collapse 	 d 	 	over	the	last	30	 year 	 s 	 	?
 dictator 	 ship 	 s 	 	in	czechoslovakia	,	east	germany	,	estonia	,	latvia	,	lithuania	,	mali	,	madagascar	,	poland	,	the	philippines	,	serbia	,	slovenia	,	i	could	go	on	,	and	now	tunisia	and	egypt	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	just	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
a	lot	of	it	is	due	to	a	book	written	by	an	80	-	year	-	old	man	in	boston	,	gene	sharp	.
he	wrote	a	book	 call 	 ed 	 	``	from	 dictator 	 ship 	 	to	 demo 	 cracy 	 	``	with	81	 method 	 o 	 logies 	 	for	non	-	violent	 resist 	 ance 	 	.
and	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 transl 	 ated 	 	 in 	 to 	 	26	 language 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 flow 	 n 	 	around	the	world	.
and	it	's	 be 	 ing 	 	used	by	young	people	and	 old 	 er 	 	people	 every 	 where 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 work 	 s 	 	and	it	's	effective	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 give 	 s 	 	me	hope	--	not	just	hope	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 make 	 s 	 	me	feel	 ver 	 y 	 	positive	right	now	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 final 	 ly 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	are	 get 	 ting 	 	it	.
we	're	 get 	 ting 	 	practical	,	 do 	 able 	 	 method 	 o 	 logies 	 	to	answer	my	question	:	how	do	we	deal	with	a	 bull 	 y 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 be 	 coming 	 	a	thug	?
we	're	using	the	kind	of	 skill 	 s 	 	that	i	've	 out 	 lined 	 	:	inner	power	--	the	 develop 	 ment 	 	of	inner	power	--	through	self	-	knowledge	,	 recogn 	 izing 	 	and	 work 	 ing 	 	with	our	fear	,	using	anger	 a 	 s 	 	a	fuel	,	 co 	 oper 	 ating 	 	with	 other 	 s 	 	,	 band 	 ing 	 	together	with	 other 	 s 	 	,	courage	,	and	most	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	 commit 	 ment 	 	to	active	non	-	violence	.
now	i	do	n't	just	 believ 	 e 	 	in	non	-	violence	.
i	do	n't	have	to	 believ 	 e 	 	in	it	.
i	see	evidence	 every 	 where 	 	of	how	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
and	i	see	that	we	,	 ordin 	 ary 	 	people	,	can	do	what	aung	san	suu	kyi	and	ghandi	and	mandela	did	.
we	can	 br 	 ing 	 	to	an	end	the	 blood 	 iest 	 	century	that	 human 	 ity 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	known	.
and	we	can	organize	to	 over 	 come 	 	 oppress 	 ion 	 	by	 open 	 ing 	 	our	 heart 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 strength 	 en 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	 re 	 solve 	 	.
