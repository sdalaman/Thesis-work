i	'm	going	to	talk	about	the	strategizing	brain	.
we	're	going	to	use	an	 un 	 usual 	 	combination	of	 tool 	 s 	 	from	game	 theor 	 y 	 	and	 neuro 	 science 	 	to	understand	how	people	interact	 social 	 ly 	 	when	value	is	on	the	line	.
so	game	 theor 	 y 	 	is	a	branch	of	,	 original 	 ly 	 	,	 appli 	 ed 	 	 mathematic 	 s 	 	,	used	 most 	 ly 	 	in	 economic 	 s 	 	and	 politic 	 al 	 	science	,	a	little	bit	in	biology	,	that	 give 	 s 	 	us	a	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 tax 	 o 	 nomy 	 	of	social	life	and	it	 predict 	 s 	 	what	people	are	 like 	 ly 	 	to	do	and	 believ 	 e 	 	 other 	 s 	 	will	do	in	 case 	 s 	 	where	 every 	 one 	 	's	 action 	 s 	 	affect	 every 	 one 	 	else	.
that	's	a	lot	of	 thing 	 s 	 	:	 com 	 petition 	 	,	 co 	 operation 	 	,	 bar 	 gain 	 ing 	 	,	 game 	 s 	 	like	hide	-	and	-	seek	,	and	 poke 	 r 	 	.
here	's	a	simple	game	to	get	us	 start 	 ed 	 	.
 every 	 one 	 	 choos 	 es 	 	a	number	from	zero	to	100	,	we	're	going	to	compute	the	average	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 number 	 s 	 	,	and	 who 	 ever 	 	's	 close 	 st 	 	to	two	-	 third 	 s 	 	of	the	average	 win 	 s 	 	a	 fix 	 ed 	 	prize	.
so	you	want	to	be	a	little	bit	 be 	 low 	 	the	average	number	,	but	not	too	far	 be 	 low 	 	,	and	 every 	 one 	 	else	 want 	 s 	 	to	be	a	little	bit	 be 	 low 	 	the	average	number	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
think	about	what	you	might	pick	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 to 	 y 	 	model	of	 some 	 thing 	 	like	selling	in	the	stock	market	 dur 	 ing 	 	a	 ris 	 ing 	 	market	.	right	?
you	do	n't	want	to	sell	too	early	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	 mis 	 s 	 	out	on	 profit 	 s 	 	,	but	you	do	n't	want	to	wait	too	late	to	when	 every 	 one 	 	else	 sell 	 s 	 	,	 trigger 	 ing 	 	a	crash	.
you	want	to	be	a	little	bit	 a 	 head 	 	of	the	 com 	 petition 	 	,	but	not	too	far	 a 	 head 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	here	's	two	 the 	 ories 	 	about	how	people	might	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	then	we	'll	see	some	data	.
some	of	these	will	sound	familiar	 be 	 cause 	 	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	are	 think 	 ing 	 	that	way	.	i	'm	using	my	brain	 theor 	 y 	 	to	see	.
a	lot	of	people	say	,	``	i	 re 	 ally 	 	do	n't	know	what	people	are	going	to	pick	,	so	i	think	the	average	will	be	50.	``	they	're	not	 be 	 ing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 strat 	 egic 	 	at	all	.
``	and	i	'll	pick	two	-	 third 	 s 	 	of	50.	that	's	33.	``	that	's	a	start	.
other	people	who	are	a	little	more	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	,	using	more	 work 	 ing 	 	 memor 	 y 	 	,	say	,	``	i	think	people	will	pick	33	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	going	to	pick	a	 respons 	 e 	 	to	50	,	and	so	i	'll	pick	22	,	which	is	two	-	 third 	 s 	 	of	33.	``
they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	one	extra	step	of	 think 	 ing 	 	,	two	 step 	 s 	 	.
that	's	better	.	and	of	course	,	in	principle	,	you	could	do	three	,	four	or	more	,	but	it	 start 	 s 	 	to	get	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	.
just	like	in	language	and	other	 domain 	 s 	 	,	we	know	that	it	's	hard	for	people	to	parse	 ver 	 y 	 	complex	 sentence 	 s 	 	with	a	kind	of	 recur 	 s 	 ive 	 	structure	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	a	cognitive	 hierarch 	 y 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	,	by	the	way	.
it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	've	 work 	 ed 	 	on	and	a	few	other	people	,	and	it	 indic 	 ates 	 	a	kind	of	 hierarch 	 y 	 	 a 	 long 	 	with	some	 assumption 	 s 	 	about	how	 man 	 y 	 	people	stop	at	different	 step 	 s 	 	and	how	the	 step 	 s 	 	of	 think 	 ing 	 	are	 affect 	 ed 	 	by	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	 vari 	 able 	 s 	 	and	 vari 	 ant 	 	people	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	'll	see	in	a	minute	.
a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	 theor 	 y 	 	,	a	much	more	popular	one	,	and	an	 old 	 er 	 	one	,	due	 large 	 ly 	 	to	john	nash	of	``	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	mind	``	fame	,	is	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	equilibrium	analysis	.
so	if	you	've	ever	taken	a	game	 theor 	 y 	 	course	at	any	level	,	you	will	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	a	little	bit	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
an	equilibrium	is	a	 mathematic 	 al 	 	state	in	which	 every 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	 every 	 one 	 	else	will	do	.
it	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	 con 	 cept 	 	,	but	 behavior 	 ally 	 	,	it	may	not	 exact 	 ly 	 	explain	what	people	do	the	first	time	they	play	these	 type 	 s 	 	of	economic	 game 	 s 	 	or	in	 situ 	 ations 	 	in	the	 out 	 side 	 	world	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	the	equilibrium	 make 	 s 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	bold	 predict 	 ion 	 	,	which	is	 every 	 one 	 	 want 	 s 	 	to	be	 be 	 low 	 	 every 	 one 	 	else	,	 there 	 fore 	 	they	'll	play	zero	.
let	's	see	what	 happen 	 s 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	experiment	's	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	.
some	of	the	 ear 	 liest 	 	 one 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 d 	 one 	 	in	the	'90s	by	me	and	rosemarie	nagel	and	 other 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	data	set	of	9,000	people	who	wrote	in	to	three	 news 	 paper 	 s 	 	and	 magazine 	 s 	 	that	had	a	contest	.
the	contest	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 s 	 end 	 	in	your	 number 	 s 	 	and	 who 	 ever 	 	is	close	to	two	-	 third 	 s 	 	of	the	average	will	win	a	big	prize	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	there	's	so	much	data	here	,	you	can	see	the	 spike 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 vis 	 ibly 	 	.
there	's	a	spike	at	33.	 t 	 hose 	 	are	people	 do 	 ing 	 	one	step	.
there	is	 an 	 other 	 	spike	visible	at	22	.
and	notice	,	by	the	way	,	that	most	people	pick	 number 	 s 	 	right	around	there	.
they	do	n't	 necess 	 arily 	 	pick	 exact 	 ly 	 	33	and	22	.
there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	a	little	bit	noisy	around	it	.
but	you	can	see	 t 	 hose 	 	 spike 	 s 	 	,	and	they	're	there	.
there	's	 an 	 other 	 	group	of	people	who	seem	to	have	a	firm	grip	on	equilibrium	analysis	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 pick 	 ing 	 	zero	or	one	.
but	they	lose	,	right	?
 be 	 cause 	 	 pick 	 ing 	 	a	number	that	low	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	bad	choice	if	other	people	are	n't	 do 	 ing 	 	equilibrium	analysis	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
so	they	're	smart	,	but	poor	.
where	are	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	the	brain	?
one	 stud 	 y 	 	by	coricelli	and	nagel	 give 	 s 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	sharp	,	 interest 	 ing 	 	answer	.
so	they	had	people	play	 th 	 is 	 	game	while	they	 we 	 re 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 can 	 ned 	 	in	an	fmri	,	and	two	 condition 	 s 	 	:	in	some	 trial 	 s 	 	,	they	're	told	you	're	 play 	 ing 	 	 an 	 other 	 	person	who	's	 play 	 ing 	 	right	now	and	we	're	going	to	match	up	your	behavior	at	the	end	and	pay	you	if	you	win	.
in	the	other	 trial 	 s 	 	,	they	're	told	,	you	're	 play 	 ing 	 	a	computer	.
they	're	just	 choos 	 ing 	 	 random 	 ly 	 	.
so	what	you	see	here	is	a	 subtract 	 ion 	 	of	 area 	 s 	 	in	which	there	's	more	brain	activity	when	you	're	 play 	 ing 	 	people	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	 play 	 ing 	 	the	computer	.
and	you	see	activity	in	some	 region 	 s 	 	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	 media 	 l 	 	 pre 	 frontal 	 	cortex	,	dorsomedial	,	 how 	 ever 	 	,	up	here	,	ventromedial	 pre 	 frontal 	 	cortex	,	 an 	 terior 	 	 c 	 ing 	 ulate 	 	,	an	area	that	's	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 type 	 s 	 	of	conflict	 re 	 solution 	 	,	like	if	you	're	 play 	 ing 	 	``	simon	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	and	 al 	 so 	 	the	right	and	left	temporoparietal	junction	.
and	these	are	all	 area 	 s 	 	which	are	 fair 	 ly 	 	 reli 	 ably 	 	known	to	be	part	of	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	a	``	 theor 	 y 	 	of	mind	``	circuit	,	or	``	mentalizing	circuit	.	``
that	is	,	it	's	a	circuit	that	's	used	to	imagine	what	other	people	might	do	.
so	these	 we 	 re 	 	some	of	the	first	 stud 	 ies 	 	to	see	 th 	 is 	 	 ti 	 ed 	 	in	to	game	 theor 	 y 	 	.
what	 happen 	 s 	 	with	these	one	-	and	two	-	step	 type 	 s 	 	?
so	we	 class 	 ify 	 	people	by	what	they	 pick 	 ed 	 	,	and	then	we	look	at	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	 play 	 ing 	 	 human 	 s 	 	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	,	which	brain	 area 	 s 	 	are	 different 	 i 	 ally 	 	active	.
on	the	top	you	see	the	one	-	step	 player 	 s 	 	.
there	's	 al 	 most 	 	no	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
the	reason	is	,	they	're	 treat 	 ing 	 	other	people	like	a	computer	,	and	the	brain	is	too	.
the	bottom	 player 	 s 	 	,	you	see	all	the	activity	in	dorsomedial	pfc	.
so	we	know	that	 t 	 hose 	 	two	-	step	 player 	 s 	 	are	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	.
now	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	to	step	back	and	say	,	``	what	can	we	do	with	 th 	 is 	 	information	?	``	you	might	be	able	to	look	at	brain	activity	and	say	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	person	's	going	to	be	a	good	 poke 	 r 	 	player	,	``	or	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	person	's	 social 	 ly 	 	naive	,	``	and	we	might	 al 	 so 	 	be	able	to	 stud 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 develop 	 ment 	 	of	adolescent	 brain 	 s 	 	once	we	have	an	idea	of	where	 th 	 is 	 	 circuit 	 ry 	 	 exist 	 s 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	get	ready	.
i	'm	saving	you	some	brain	activity	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	do	n't	need	to	use	your	hair	 detect 	 or 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	.
you	should	use	 t 	 hose 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	to	think	 care 	 fully 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	game	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 bar 	 gain 	 ing 	 	game	.
two	 player 	 s 	 	who	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 can 	 ned 	 	using	eeg	 electro 	 de 	 s 	 	are	going	to	 bar 	 gain 	 	over	one	to	six	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
if	they	can	do	it	in	10	 second 	 s 	 	,	they	're	going	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	earn	that	money	.
if	10	 second 	 s 	 	 go 	 es 	 	by	and	they	have	n't	made	a	deal	,	they	get	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
that	's	kind	of	a	 mistak 	 e 	 	together	.
the	twist	is	that	one	player	,	on	the	left	,	is	 inform 	 ed 	 	about	how	much	on	each	trial	there	is	.
they	play	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 trial 	 s 	 	with	different	 amount 	 s 	 	each	time	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	they	know	there	's	four	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
the	 un 	 inform 	 ed 	 	player	 do 	 es 	 	n't	know	,	but	they	know	that	the	 inform 	 ed 	 	player	 know 	 s 	 	.
so	the	 un 	 inform 	 ed 	 	player	's	 challeng 	 e 	 	is	to	say	,	``	is	 th 	 is 	 	guy	 re 	 ally 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	fair	or	are	they	giving	me	a	 ver 	 y 	 	low	 off 	 er 	 	in	order	to	get	me	to	think	that	there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	one	or	two	 dollar 	 s 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	to	split	?	``	in	which	case	they	might	reject	it	and	not	come	to	a	deal	.
so	there	's	some	tension	here	between	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	the	most	money	but	 try 	 ing 	 	to	goad	the	other	player	 in 	 to 	 	giving	you	more	.
and	the	way	they	 bar 	 gain 	 	is	to	point	on	a	number	line	that	 go 	 es 	 	from	zero	to	six	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	and	they	're	 bar 	 gain 	 ing 	 	over	how	much	the	 un 	 inform 	 ed 	 	player	 get 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 inform 	 ed 	 	player	's	going	to	get	the	rest	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	like	a	management	-	labor	 negoti 	 ation 	 	in	which	the	 work 	 ers 	 	do	n't	know	how	much	 profit 	 s 	 	the	 private 	 ly 	 	held	company	 ha 	 s 	 	,	right	,	and	they	want	to	 may 	 be 	 	hold	out	for	more	money	,	but	the	company	might	want	to	create	the	impression	that	there	's	 ver 	 y 	 	little	to	split	:	``	i	'm	giving	you	the	most	that	i	can	.	``	first	some	behavior	.	so	a	bunch	of	the	subject	 pair 	 s 	 	,	they	play	face	to	face	.
we	have	some	other	data	where	they	play	 a 	 cross 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	.
that	's	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	might	imagine	.
but	a	bunch	of	the	face	-	to	-	face	 pair 	 s 	 	agree	to	divide	the	money	 even 	 ly 	 	every	single	time	.
 bor 	 ing 	 	.	it	's	just	not	 interest 	 ing 	 	 neural 	 ly 	 	.
it	's	good	for	them	.	they	make	a	lot	of	money	.
but	we	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	,	can	we	say	 some 	 thing 	 	about	when	 disagree 	 ments 	 	occur	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	do	n't	occur	?
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	other	group	of	 subject 	 s 	 	who	often	disagree	.
so	they	have	a	chance	of	--	they	bicker	and	disagree	and	end	up	with	less	money	.
they	might	be	eligible	to	be	on	``	real	 house 	 wives 	 	,	``	the	tv	show	.
you	see	on	the	left	,	when	the	amount	to	divide	is	one	,	two	or	three	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	they	disagree	about	half	the	time	,	and	when	the	amount	is	four	,	five	,	six	,	they	agree	 quit 	 e 	 	often	.
 th 	 is 	 	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	be	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	 predict 	 ed 	 	by	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	type	of	game	 theor 	 y 	 	you	should	come	to	graduate	school	at	caltech	and	learn	about	.
it	's	a	little	too	 complic 	 ated 	 	to	explain	right	now	,	but	the	 theor 	 y 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	you	that	 th 	 is 	 	shape	kind	of	should	occur	.
your	 intuit 	 ion 	 	might	tell	you	that	too	.
now	i	'm	going	to	show	you	the	 result 	 s 	 	from	the	eeg	 record 	 ing 	 	.
 ver 	 y 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	.	the	right	brain	schematic	is	the	 un 	 inform 	 ed 	 	person	,	and	the	left	is	the	 inform 	 ed 	 	.
remember	that	we	 s 	 can 	 ned 	 	both	 brain 	 s 	 	at	the	same	time	,	so	we	can	ask	about	time	-	synced	activity	in	similar	or	different	 area 	 s 	 	 simultaneous 	 ly 	 	,	just	like	if	you	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 stud 	 y 	 	a	conversation	and	you	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 canning 	 	two	people	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	each	other
and	you	'd	expect	common	activity	in	language	 region 	 s 	 	when	they	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	kind	of	 listen 	 ing 	 	and	 commun 	 ic 	 ating 	 	.
so	the	 arrow 	 s 	 	connect	 region 	 s 	 	that	are	active	at	the	same	time	,	and	the	direction	of	the	 arrow 	 s 	 	 flow 	 s 	 	from	the	region	that	's	active	first	in	time	,	and	the	arrowhead	 go 	 es 	 	to	the	region	that	's	active	 lat 	 er 	 	.
so	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	if	you	look	 care 	 fully 	 	,	most	of	the	 arrow 	 s 	 	flow	from	right	to	left	.
that	is	,	it	 look 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	if	the	 un 	 inform 	 ed 	 	brain	activity	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	first	,	and	then	it	's	 follow 	 ed 	 	by	activity	in	the	 inform 	 ed 	 	brain	.
and	by	the	way	,	these	 we 	 re 	 	 trial 	 s 	 	where	 the 	 ir 	 	 deal 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	made	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	from	the	first	two	 second 	 s 	 	.
we	have	n't	 finish 	 ed 	 	 analyz 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	data	,	so	we	're	still	 peek 	 ing 	 	in	,	but	the	hope	is	that	we	can	say	 some 	 thing 	 	in	the	first	couple	of	 second 	 s 	 	about	 whet 	 her 	 	they	'll	make	a	deal	or	not	,
which	could	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	in	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 avoid 	 ing 	 	 litig 	 ation 	 	and	 ug 	 ly 	 	 divorce 	 s 	 	and	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	.
 t 	 hose 	 	are	all	 case 	 s 	 	in	which	a	lot	of	value	is	lost	by	delay	and	 strike 	 s 	 	.
here	's	the	case	where	the	 disagree 	 ments 	 	occur	.
you	can	see	it	 look 	 s 	 	different	than	the	one	before	.
there	's	a	lot	more	 arrow 	 s 	 	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	the	 brain 	 s 	 	are	synced	up	more	 close 	 ly 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	simultaneous	activity	,	and	the	 arrow 	 s 	 	flow	 clear 	 ly 	 	from	left	to	right	.
that	is	,	the	 inform 	 ed 	 	brain	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	 dec 	 id 	 ing 	 	,	``	we	're	 prob 	 ably 	 	not	going	to	make	a	deal	here	.	``	and	then	 lat 	 er 	 	there	's	activity	in	the	 un 	 inform 	 ed 	 	brain	.
next	i	'm	going	to	 introduc 	 e 	 	you	to	some	 relat 	 ive 	 s 	 	.
they	're	 hair 	 y 	 	,	 smell 	 y 	 	,	fast	and	strong	.
you	might	be	 think 	 ing 	 	back	to	your	last	 thank 	 s 	 giving 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	if	you	had	a	chimpanzee	with	you	.
charles	darwin	and	i	and	you	broke	off	from	the	family	tree	from	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	about	five	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
they	're	still	our	 close 	 st 	 	genetic	kin	.
we	share	98.8	percent	of	the	 gene 	 s 	 	.
we	share	more	 gene 	 s 	 	with	them	than	 zebra 	 s 	 	do	with	 horse 	 s 	 	.
and	we	're	 al 	 so 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 close 	 st 	 	cousin	.
they	have	more	genetic	relation	to	us	than	to	 gorilla 	 s 	 	.
so	how	 human 	 s 	 	and	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	 behav 	 e 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	might	tell	us	a	lot	about	brain	evolution	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 memor 	 y 	 	test	from	nagoya	,	japan	,	 prim 	 ate 	 	research	institute	,	where	they	've	 d 	 one 	 	a	lot	of	 th 	 is 	 	research	.
 th 	 is 	 	 go 	 es 	 	back	 quit 	 e 	 	a	ways	.	they	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 work 	 ing 	 	 memor 	 y 	 	.
they	're	going	to	see	200	 milli 	 second 	 s 	 	'	 expo 	 s 	 ure 	 	--	that	's	fast	,	that	's	eight	movie	 frame 	 s 	 	--	of	 number 	 s 	 	one	,	two	,	three	,	four	,	five	.
then	they	disappear	and	they	're	 replace 	 d 	 	by	 square 	 s 	 	,	and	they	have	to	press	the	 square 	 s 	 	that	correspond	to	the	 number 	 s 	 	from	low	to	high	to	get	an	apple	reward	.
let	's	see	how	they	can	do	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	young	chimp	.	the	young	 one 	 s 	 	are	better	than	the	old	 one 	 s 	 	,	just	like	 human 	 s 	 	.
and	they	're	 high 	 ly 	 	 experience 	 d 	 	,	so	they	've	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	and	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	time	.
 obvious 	 ly 	 	there	's	a	big	training	effect	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	imagine	.
you	can	see	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	blasé	and	kind	of	 effort 	 less 	 	.
not	 on 	 ly 	 	can	they	do	it	 ver 	 y 	 	well	,	they	do	it	in	a	sort	of	 laz 	 y 	 	way	.
right	?	who	 think 	 s 	 	you	could	beat	the	 chimp 	 s 	 	?
wrong	.
we	can	try	.	we	'll	try	.	 may 	 be 	 	we	'll	try	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	the	next	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	i	'm	going	to	go	 quick 	 ly 	 	through	is	based	on	an	idea	of	tetsuro	matsuzawa	.
he	had	a	bold	idea	that	--	what	he	 call 	 ed 	 	the	cognitive	trade	-	off	 hypo 	 thesis 	 	.
we	know	 chimp 	 s 	 	are	 fast 	 er 	 	and	 strong 	 er 	 	.
they	're	 al 	 so 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	 stat 	 us 	 	.
his	thought	was	,	 may 	 be 	 	they	've	 preserve 	 d 	 	brain	 activ 	 ities 	 	and	they	practice	them	in	 develop 	 ment 	 	that	are	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	them	to	 negoti 	 ate 	 	 stat 	 us 	 	and	to	win	,	which	is	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 strat 	 egic 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	 com 	 petition 	 	.
so	we	're	going	to	check	that	out	by	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	 chimp 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	play	a	game	by	 touch 	 ing 	 	two	touch	 screen 	 s 	 	.
the	 chimp 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 interact 	 ing 	 	with	each	other	through	the	 computer 	 s 	 	.
they	're	going	to	press	left	or	right	.
one	chimp	is	 call 	 ed 	 	a	matcher	.
they	win	if	they	press	left	,	left	,	like	a	seeker	 find 	 ing 	 	 some 	 one 	 	in	hide	-	and	-	seek	,	or	right	,	right	.
the	mismatcher	 want 	 s 	 	to	 mis 	 match 	 	.
they	want	to	press	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	screen	of	the	chimp	.
and	the	 reward 	 s 	 	are	apple	cube	 reward 	 s 	 	.
so	here	's	how	game	 theor 	 ists 	 	look	at	these	data	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	graph	of	the	 percent 	 age 	 	of	 time 	 s 	 	the	matcher	 pick 	 ed 	 	right	on	the	x	-	axis	,	and	the	 percent 	 age 	 	of	 time 	 s 	 	they	 predict 	 ed 	 	right	by	the	mismatcher	on	the	y	-	axis	.
so	a	point	here	is	the	behavior	by	a	pair	of	 player 	 s 	 	,	one	 try 	 ing 	 	to	match	,	one	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 mis 	 match 	 	.
the	ne	square	in	the	middle	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	ne	,	ch	and	qre	--	 t 	 hose 	 	are	three	different	 the 	 ories 	 	of	nash	equilibrium	,	and	 other 	 s 	 	,	 tell 	 s 	 	you	what	the	 theor 	 y 	 	 predict 	 s 	 	,	which	is	that	they	should	match	50-50	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	play	left	too	much	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	i	can	exploit	that	if	i	'm	the	mismatcher	by	then	 play 	 ing 	 	right	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	the	 chimp 	 s 	 	,	each	chimp	is	one	triangle	,	are	 circle 	 d 	 	around	,	 hover 	 ing 	 	around	that	 predict 	 ion 	 	.
now	we	move	the	payoffs	.
we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	to	make	the	left	,	left	 pay 	 off 	 	for	the	matcher	a	little	bit	 high 	 er 	 	.
now	they	get	three	apple	 cube 	 s 	 	.
game	 theoretic 	 ally 	 	,	that	should	 actual 	 ly 	 	make	the	mismatcher	's	behavior	shift	,	 be 	 cause 	 	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	,	the	mismatcher	will	think	,	oh	,	 th 	 is 	 	guy	's	going	to	go	for	the	big	reward	,	and	so	i	'm	going	to	go	to	the	right	,	make	 s 	 ure 	 	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	get	it	.	and	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	 the 	 ir 	 	behavior	 move 	 s 	 	up	in	the	direction	of	 th 	 is 	 	change	in	the	nash	equilibrium	.
 final 	 ly 	 	,	we	 change 	 d 	 	the	payoffs	one	more	time	.
now	it	's	four	apple	 cube 	 s 	 	,	and	 the 	 ir 	 	behavior	 aga 	 in 	 	 move 	 s 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	nash	equilibrium	.
it	's	sprinkled	around	,	but	if	you	average	the	 chimp 	 s 	 	out	,	they	're	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	close	,	 with 	 in 	 	.01	.
they	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 close 	 r 	 	than	any	species	we	've	 observ 	 ed 	 	.
what	about	 human 	 s 	 	?	you	think	you	're	 smart 	 er 	 	than	a	chimpanzee	?
here	's	two	human	 group 	 s 	 	in	green	and	blue	.
they	're	 close 	 r 	 	to	50-50	.	they	're	not	 respond 	 ing 	 	to	payoffs	 a 	 s 	 	 close 	 ly 	 	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	if	you	 stud 	 y 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	in	the	game	,	they	are	n't	 a 	 s 	 	sensitive	to	previous	 reward 	 s 	 	.
the	 chimp 	 s 	 	are	 play 	 ing 	 	better	than	the	 human 	 s 	 	,	better	in	the	sense	of	adhering	to	game	 theor 	 y 	 	.
and	these	are	two	different	 group 	 s 	 	of	 human 	 s 	 	from	japan	and	africa	.	they	replicate	 quit 	 e 	 	 nice 	 ly 	 	.
 non 	 e 	 	of	them	are	close	to	where	the	 chimp 	 s 	 	are	.
so	here	are	some	 thing 	 s 	 	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
people	seem	to	do	a	 limit 	 ed 	 	amount	of	 strat 	 egic 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	using	 theor 	 y 	 	of	mind	.
we	have	some	 pre 	 liminary 	 	evidence	from	 bar 	 gain 	 ing 	 	that	early	 war 	 ning 	 	 sign 	 s 	 	in	the	brain	might	be	used	to	predict	 whet 	 her 	 	there	will	be	a	bad	 disagree 	 ment 	 	that	 cost 	 s 	 	money	,	and	 chimp 	 s 	 	are	better	 competitor 	 s 	 	than	 human 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 judg 	 ed 	 	by	game	 theor 	 y 	 	.
thank	you	.
