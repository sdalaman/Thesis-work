i	'm	going	to	talk	about	the	power	of	a	word	:	jihad	.	to	the	vast	 major 	 ity 	 	of	 p 	 rac 	 tic 	 ing 	 	muslims	,	jihad	is	an	internal	struggle	for	the	faith	.
it	is	a	struggle	 with 	 in 	 	,	a	struggle	against	vice	,	 s 	 in 	 	,	 tempt 	 ation 	 	,	lust	,	greed	.
it	is	a	struggle	to	try	and	live	a	life	that	is	set	by	the	moral	 code 	 s 	 	written	in	the	koran	.
in	that	original	idea	,	the	 con 	 cept 	 	of	jihad	is	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	muslims	 a 	 s 	 	the	idea	of	grace	is	to	christians	.
it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	word	,	jihad	,	if	you	look	at	it	in	that	respect	,	and	there	's	a	certain	 al 	 most 	 	 mystic 	 al 	 	 reson 	 ance 	 	to	it	.
and	that	's	the	reason	why	,	for	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	muslims	 every 	 where 	 	have	named	 the 	 ir 	 	children	jihad	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 daughter 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 son 	 s 	 	,	in	the	same	way	that	,	say	,	christians	name	 the 	 ir 	 	 daughter 	 s 	 	grace	,	and	hindus	,	my	people	,	name	our	 daughter 	 s 	 	bhakti	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	,	in	sanskrit	,	spiritual	worship	.
but	there	have	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	,	in	islam	,	a	small	group	,	a	 minor 	 ity 	 	,	who	 believ 	 e 	 	that	jihad	is	not	 on 	 ly 	 	an	internal	struggle	but	 al 	 so 	 	an	external	struggle	against	 force 	 s 	 	that	would	threaten	the	faith	,	or	the	faithul	.
and	some	of	these	people	 believ 	 e 	 	that	in	that	struggle	,	it	is	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	to	take	up	 arm 	 s 	 	.
and	so	the	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	young	muslim	men	who	 flock 	 ed 	 	to	afghanistan	in	the	1980s	to	fight	against	the	soviet	occupation	of	a	muslim	country	,	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 mind 	 s 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 fight 	 ing 	 	a	jihad	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	jihad	,	and	they	named	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	the	mujahideen	,	which	is	a	word	that	 come 	 s 	 	from	the	same	root	 a 	 s 	 	jihad	.
and	we	forget	 th 	 is 	 	now	,	but	back	then	the	mujahideen	 we 	 re 	 	 celebr 	 ated 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	,	in	america	.
we	thought	of	them	 a 	 s 	 	holy	 warrior 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	taking	the	good	fight	to	the	ungodly	communists	.
america	 g 	 ave 	 	them	 weapon 	 s 	 	,	 g 	 ave 	 	them	money	,	 g 	 ave 	 	them	support	,	 encourag 	 ement 	 	.
but	 with 	 in 	 	that	group	,	a	 tin 	 y 	 	,	 small 	 er 	 	group	,	a	 minor 	 ity 	 	 with 	 in 	 	a	 minor 	 ity 	 	 with 	 in 	 	a	 minor 	 ity 	 	,	 we 	 re 	 	coming	up	with	a	new	and	 danger 	 ous 	 	conception	of	jihad	,	and	in	time	 th 	 is 	 	group	would	come	to	be	led	by	osama	bin	laden	,	and	he	 refine 	 d 	 	the	idea	.
his	idea	of	jihad	was	a	global	war	of	terror	,	 prim 	 arily 	 	 target 	 ed 	 	at	the	far	 ene 	 my 	 	,	at	the	crusaders	from	the	west	,	against	america	.
and	the	 thing 	 s 	 	he	did	in	the	 pur 	 suit 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	jihad	 we 	 re 	 	so	 horr 	 end 	 ous 	 	,	so	 monstr 	 ous 	 	,	and	had	 s 	 uch 	 	great	impact	,	that	his	definition	was	the	one	that	 s 	 tuck 	 	,	not	just	here	in	the	west	.
we	did	n't	know	any	better	.	we	did	n't	pause	to	ask	.
we	just	 assum 	 ed 	 	that	if	 th 	 is 	 	 insan 	 e 	 	man	and	his	 psychopath 	 ic 	 	 follow 	 ers 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 call 	 ing 	 	what	they	did	jihad	,	then	that	's	what	jihad	must	mean	.
but	it	was	n't	just	us	.	even	in	the	muslim	world	,	his	definition	of	jihad	 beg 	 an 	 	to	gain	 accept 	 ance 	 	.
a	year	ago	i	was	in	tunis	,	and	i	met	the	imam	of	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	mosque	,	an	old	man	.
fifteen	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	he	named	his	 grand 	 daughter 	 	jihad	,	after	the	old	meaning	.	he	 hop 	 ed 	 	that	a	name	like	that	would	inspire	her	to	live	a	spiritual	life	.
but	he	told	me	that	after	9/11	,	he	 beg 	 an 	 	to	have	second	 thought 	 s 	 	.
he	 worri 	 ed 	 	that	if	he	 call 	 ed 	 	her	by	that	name	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 out 	 door 	 s 	 	,	 out 	 side 	 	in	public	,	he	might	be	 s 	 een 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 end 	 ors 	 ing 	 	bin	laden	's	idea	of	jihad	.
on	fridays	in	his	mosque	,	he	 g 	 ave 	 	 sermon 	 s 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 re 	 claim 	 	the	meaning	of	the	word	,	but	his	congregants	,	the	people	who	came	to	his	mosque	,	they	had	 s 	 een 	 	the	 video 	 s 	 	.	they	had	 s 	 een 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	of	the	 plane 	 s 	 	going	 in 	 to 	 	the	 tower 	 s 	 	,	the	 tower 	 s 	 	coming	down	.
they	had	heard	bin	laden	say	that	that	was	jihad	,	and	 claim 	 ed 	 	 vict 	 ory 	 	for	it	.	and	so	the	old	imam	 worri 	 ed 	 	that	his	 word 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 fall 	 ing 	 	on	deaf	 ear 	 s 	 	.	no	one	was	 pay 	 ing 	 	attention	.
he	was	wrong	.	some	people	 we 	 re 	 	 pay 	 ing 	 	attention	,	but	for	the	wrong	 reason 	 s 	 	.
the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	was	 put 	 ting 	 	pressure	on	all	 it 	 s 	 	arab	 al 	 lies 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	tunisia	,	to	stamp	out	 extrem 	 ism 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	imam	found	 him 	 self 	 	 sudden 	 ly 	 	in	the	crosshairs	of	the	tunisian	 intellig 	 ence 	 	service	.
they	had	never	paid	him	any	attention	before	--	old	man	,	small	mosque	--	but	now	they	 beg 	 an 	 	to	pay	 visit 	 s 	 	,	and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	they	would	drag	him	in	for	 question 	 s 	 	,	and	 al 	 ways 	 	the	same	question	:	``	why	did	you	name	your	 grand 	 daughter 	 	jihad	?
why	do	you	keep	using	the	word	jihad	in	your	friday	 sermon 	 s 	 	?
do	you	hate	americans	?
what	is	your	 connect 	 ion 	 	to	osama	bin	laden	?	``
so	to	the	tunisian	 intellig 	 ence 	 	 age 	 ncy 	 	,	and	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	like	it	all	over	the	arab	world	,	jihad	 equal 	 ed 	 	 extrem 	 ism 	 	,	bin	laden	's	definition	had	 be 	 come 	 	 institution 	 al 	 ized 	 	.
that	was	the	power	of	that	word	that	he	was	able	to	do	.
and	it	 fill 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	old	imam	,	it	 fill 	 ed 	 	him	with	great	 s 	 ad 	 ness 	 	.
he	told	me	that	,	of	bin	laden	's	 man 	 y 	 	 crime 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	,	in	his	mind	,	one	that	did	n't	get	 en 	 ough 	 	attention	,	that	he	took	 th 	 is 	 	word	,	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	idea	.
he	did	n't	so	much	appropriate	it	 a 	 s 	 	 kidnap 	 ped 	 	it	and	 de 	 based 	 	it	and	 corrupt 	 ed 	 	it	and	 turn 	 ed 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	it	was	never	 me 	 ant 	 	to	be	,	and	then	 persuad 	 ed 	 	all	of	us	that	it	 al 	 ways 	 	was	a	global	jihad	.
but	the	good	news	is	that	the	global	jihad	is	 al 	 most 	 	over	,	 a 	 s 	 	bin	laden	defined	it	.
it	was	 dy 	 ing 	 	well	before	he	did	,	and	now	it	's	on	 it 	 s 	 	last	 leg 	 s 	 	.
opinion	 poll 	 s 	 	from	all	over	the	muslim	world	show	that	there	is	 ver 	 y 	 	little	interest	among	muslims	in	a	global	holy	war	against	the	west	,	against	the	far	 ene 	 my 	 	.
the	supply	of	young	men	 will 	 ing 	 	to	fight	and	die	for	 th 	 is 	 	cause	is	 dwindl 	 ing 	 	.
the	supply	of	money	--	just	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	more	 import 	 ant 	 	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	--	the	supply	of	money	to	 th 	 is 	 	activity	is	 al 	 so 	 	 dwindl 	 ing 	 	.
the	 wealth 	 y 	 	 fanatic 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	 previous 	 ly 	 	 sponsor 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	activity	are	now	less	 gen 	 er 	 ous 	 	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	for	us	in	the	west	?
 do 	 es 	 	it	mean	we	can	break	out	the	 champ 	 agne 	 	,	wash	our	 hand 	 s 	 	of	it	,	disengage	,	sleep	easy	at	night	?
no	.	 dis 	 engage 	 ment 	 	is	not	an	option	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	let	local	jihad	 surviv 	 e 	 	,	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 inter 	 national 	 	jihad	.
and	so	there	's	now	a	lot	of	different	violent	jihads	all	over	the	world	.
in	somalia	,	in	mali	,	in	nigeria	,	in	 ir 	 aq 	 	,	in	afghanistan	,	pakistan	,	there	are	 group 	 s 	 	that	claim	to	be	the	inheritors	of	the	 leg 	 acy 	 	of	osama	bin	laden	.
they	use	his	rhetoric	.
they	even	use	the	brand	name	he	 create 	 d 	 	for	his	jihad	.
so	there	is	now	an	al	qaeda	in	the	islamic	maghreb	,	there	's	an	al	qaeda	in	the	arabian	 pen 	 insula 	 	,	there	is	an	al	qaeda	in	mesopotamia	.
there	are	other	 group 	 s 	 	--	in	nigeria	,	boko	haram	,	in	somalia	,	al	shabaab	--	and	they	all	pay	 hom 	 age 	 	to	osama	bin	laden	.
but	if	you	look	 close 	 ly 	 	,	they	're	not	 fight 	 ing 	 	a	global	jihad	.
they	're	 fight 	 ing 	 	 battle 	 s 	 	over	much	 narrow 	 er 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	.
 usual 	 ly 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	with	 ethnic 	 ity 	 	or	race	or	sectarianism	,	or	it	's	a	power	struggle	.
more	often	than	not	,	it	's	a	power	struggle	in	one	country	,	or	even	a	small	region	 with 	 in 	 	one	country	.
 occasion 	 ally 	 	they	will	go	 a 	 cross 	 	a	border	,	from	 ir 	 aq 	 	to	syria	,	from	mali	to	algeria	,	from	somalia	to	kenya	,	but	they	're	not	 fight 	 ing 	 	a	global	jihad	against	some	far	 ene 	 my 	 	.
but	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	that	we	can	relax	.
i	was	in	yemen	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	where	--	it	's	the	home	of	the	last	al	qaeda	franchise	that	still	aspires	to	attack	america	,	attack	the	west	.
it	's	old	school	al	qaeda	.
you	may	remember	these	 guy 	 s 	 	.
they	are	the	 one 	 s 	 	who	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	 s 	 end 	 	the	 under 	 wear 	 	 bomb 	 er 	 	here	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	using	the	 inter 	 net 	 	to	try	and	 in 	 stig 	 ate 	 	violence	among	american	muslims	.
but	they	have	 be 	 en 	 	 distract 	 ed 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	.
last	year	,	they	took	control	over	a	 port 	 ion 	 	of	southern	yemen	,	and	ran	it	,	taliban	-	style	.
and	then	the	yemeni	 militar 	 y 	 	got	 it 	 s 	 	act	together	,	and	 ordin 	 ary 	 	people	rose	up	against	these	 guy 	 s 	 	and	drove	them	out	,	and	since	then	,	most	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 activ 	 ities 	 	,	most	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 attack 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 direct 	 ed 	 	at	yemenis	.
so	i	think	we	've	come	to	a	point	now	where	we	can	say	that	,	just	like	all	 politic 	 s 	 	,	all	jihad	is	local	.
but	that	's	still	not	reason	for	us	to	disengage	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	that	movie	before	,	in	afghanistan	.
when	 t 	 hose 	 	mujahideen	 defeat 	 ed 	 	the	soviet	 un 	 ion 	 	,	we	 dis 	 engag 	 ed 	 	.
and	even	before	the	fizz	had	gone	out	of	our	 celebr 	 atory 	 	 champ 	 agne 	 	,	the	taliban	had	taken	over	in	kabul	,	and	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	local	jihad	,	not	our	problem	.	``
and	then	the	taliban	 g 	 ave 	 	the	 key 	 s 	 	of	kandahar	to	osama	bin	laden	.	he	made	it	our	problem	.
local	jihad	,	if	you	 ignor 	 e 	 	it	,	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	global	jihad	 aga 	 in 	 	.
the	good	news	is	that	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	to	be	.
we	know	how	to	fight	it	now	.
we	have	the	 tool 	 s 	 	.	we	have	the	knowhow	,	and	we	can	take	the	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	we	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	the	fight	against	global	jihad	,	the	 vict 	 ory 	 	against	global	jihad	,	and	 app 	 ly 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	to	local	jihad	.
what	are	 t 	 hose 	 	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	?	we	know	who	 kill 	 ed 	 	bin	laden	:	seal	team	six	.
do	we	know	,	do	we	understand	,	who	 kill 	 ed 	 	bin	ladenism	?
who	 end 	 ed 	 	the	global	jihad	?
there	lie	the	 answer 	 s 	 	to	the	solution	to	local	jihad	.
who	 kill 	 ed 	 	bin	ladenism	?	let	's	start	with	bin	laden	 him 	 self 	 	.
he	 prob 	 ably 	 	thought	9/11	was	his	 great 	 est 	 	 achiev 	 ement 	 	.
in	 re 	 ality 	 	,	it	was	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	end	for	him	.

he	 condemn 	 ed 	 	 him 	 self 	 	to	 oper 	 ating 	 	on	the	 lun 	 atic 	 	 fringe 	 s 	 	of	his	own	community	.
9/11	did	n't	empower	him	;	it	 doom 	 ed 	 	him	.
who	 kill 	 ed 	 	bin	ladenism	?	abu	musab	al-zarqawi	 kill 	 ed 	 	it	.
he	was	the	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 s 	 ad 	 istic 	 	head	of	al	qaeda	in	 ir 	 aq 	 	who	 s 	 ent 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 su 	 icide 	 	 bomb 	 ers 	 	to	attack	not	americans	but	iraqis	.	muslims	.	sunni	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	shiites	.
any	claim	that	al	qaeda	had	to	 be 	 ing 	 	 protect 	 ors 	 	of	islam	against	the	western	crusaders	was	 drown 	 ed 	 	in	the	blood	of	iraqi	muslims	.
who	 kill 	 ed 	 	osama	bin	laden	?	the	seal	team	six	.
who	 kill 	 ed 	 	bin	ladenism	?	al	jazeera	did	,
al	jazeera	and	half	a	dozen	other	satellite	news	 station 	 s 	 	in	arabic	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	circumvented	the	old	,	state	-	owned	 tele 	 vision 	 	 station 	 s 	 	in	a	lot	of	these	 count 	 ries 	 	which	 we 	 re 	 	designed	to	keep	information	from	people	.

who	 defeat 	 ed 	 	the	global	jihad	?	the	american	 militar 	 y 	 	did	,	the	american	 soldier 	 s 	 	did	,	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 al 	 lies 	 	,	 fight 	 ing 	 	in	faraway	 battle 	 field 	 s 	 	.
and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	a	time	will	come	when	they	get	the	 right 	 ful 	 	credit	for	it	.
so	all	these	 factor 	 s 	 	,	and	 man 	 y 	 	more	 be 	 side 	 s 	 	,	we	do	n't	even	fully	understand	some	of	them	yet	,	these	came	together	to	defeat	a	monstrosity	 a 	 s 	 	big	 a 	 s 	 	bin	ladenism	,	the	global	jihad	,	you	 need 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	group	effort	.
now	,	not	all	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	will	work	in	local	jihad	.
the	american	 militar 	 y 	 	is	not	going	to	march	 in 	 to 	 	nigeria	to	take	on	boko	haram	,	and	it	's	 un 	 like 	 ly 	 	that	seal	team	six	will	rappel	 in 	 to 	 	the	 home 	 s 	 	of	al	shabaab	's	 lead 	 ers 	 	and	take	them	out	.
but	 man 	 y 	 	of	these	other	 factor 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	in	play	are	now	even	 strong 	 er 	 	than	before	.	half	the	work	is	 al 	 ready 	 	 d 	 one 	 	.
we	do	n't	have	to	 re 	 invent 	 	the	wheel	.
the	 not 	 ion 	 	of	violent	jihad	in	which	more	muslims	are	 kill 	 ed 	 	than	any	other	kind	of	people	is	 al 	 ready 	 	 thorough 	 ly 	 	 dis 	 credit 	 ed 	 	.
we	do	n't	have	to	go	back	to	that	.
satellite	 tele 	 vision 	 	and	the	 inter 	 net 	 	are	 inform 	 ing 	 	and	 empower 	 ing 	 	young	muslims	in	 excit 	 ing 	 	new	ways	.
and	the	arab	spring	 ha 	 s 	 	 produce 	 d 	 	 government 	 s 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	them	islamist	 government 	 s 	 	,	who	know	that	,	for	 the 	 ir 	 	own	self	-	 p 	 reservation 	 	,	they	need	to	take	on	the	 extrem 	 ists 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	midsts	.
we	do	n't	need	to	 persuad 	 e 	 	them	,	but	we	do	need	to	help	them	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	have	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	come	to	 th 	 is 	 	place	before	.
the	good	news	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	is	that	a	lot	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	they	need	we	 al 	 ready 	 	have	,	and	we	are	 ver 	 y 	 	good	at	giving	:	economic	 assist 	 ance 	 	,	not	just	money	,	but	 expert 	 ise 	 	,	technology	,	knowhow	,	private	 invest 	 ment 	 	,	fair	 term 	 s 	 	of	trade	,	medicine	,	education	,	technical	support	for	training	for	 the 	 ir 	 	police	 force 	 s 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	more	effective	,	for	 the 	 ir 	 	anti	-	terror	 force 	 s 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	more	efficient	.
