i	've	 be 	 en 	 	a	journalist	now	since	i	was	about	17	,	and	it	's	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	industry	to	be	in	at	the	moment	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	all	know	,	there	's	a	huge	amount	of	 up 	 heav 	 al 	 	going	on	in	media	,	and	most	of	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	know	 th 	 is 	 	from	the	business	angle	,	which	is	that	the	business	model	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	 screw 	 ed 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	my	 grand 	 father 	 	would	say	,	the	 profit 	 s 	 	have	all	 be 	 en 	 	gobbled	up	by	google	.
so	it	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	time	to	be	a	journalist	,	but	the	 up 	 heav 	 al 	 	that	i	'm	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	is	not	on	the	 out 	 put 	 	side	.
it	's	on	the	 in 	 put 	 	side	.	it	's	concern	with	how	we	get	information	and	how	we	gather	the	news	.
and	that	's	 change 	 d 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	've	had	a	huge	shift	in	the	balance	of	power	from	the	news	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	to	the	audience	.
and	the	audience	for	 s 	 uch 	 	a	long	time	was	in	a	position	where	they	did	n't	have	any	way	of	 affect 	 ing 	 	news	or	making	any	change	.	they	could	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	connect	.
and	that	's	 change 	 d 	 	 irrevoc 	 ably 	 	.
my	first	 connect 	 ion 	 	with	the	news	media	was	in	1984	,	the	bbc	had	a	one	-	day	strike	.
i	was	n't	happy	.	i	was	 ang 	 ry 	 	.	i	could	n't	see	my	 cartoon 	 s 	 	.
so	i	wrote	a	letter	.
and	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	effective	way	of	 end 	 ing 	 	your	hate	mail	:	``	love	markham	,	aged	4.	``	still	 work 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	if	i	had	any	impact	on	the	one	-	day	strike	,	but	what	i	do	know	is	that	it	took	them	three	 week 	 s 	 	to	get	back	to	me	.
and	that	was	the	round	journey	.	it	took	that	long	for	 any 	 one 	 	to	have	any	impact	and	get	some	 feed 	 back 	 	.
and	that	's	 change 	 d 	 	now	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 journalist 	 s 	 	,	we	interact	in	real	time	.	we	're	not	in	a	position	where	the	audience	is	 react 	 ing 	 	to	news	.
we	're	 react 	 ing 	 	to	the	audience	,	and	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 re 	 ly 	 ing 	 	on	them	.
they	're	 help 	 ing 	 	us	find	the	news	.	they	're	 help 	 ing 	 	us	figure	out	what	is	the	best	angle	to	take	and	what	is	the	stuff	that	they	want	to	hear	.
so	it	's	a	real	-	time	thing	.	it	's	much	 quick 	 er 	 	.	it	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	on	a	constant	 bas 	 is 	 	,	and	the	journalist	is	 al 	 ways 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	catch	up	.
to	give	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	how	we	 re 	 ly 	 	on	the	audience	,	on	the	5th	of	september	in	costa	rica	,	an	 earth 	 quake 	 	hit	.
it	was	a	7.6	 magn 	 itude 	 	.	it	was	 fair 	 ly 	 	big	.
and	60	 second 	 s 	 	is	the	amount	of	time	it	took	for	it	to	travel	250	 kilometer 	 s 	 	to	managua	.
so	the	ground	 s 	 hook 	 	in	managua	60	 second 	 s 	 	after	it	hit	the	 epi 	 center 	 	.	thirty	 second 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	the	first	 mess 	 age 	 	went	onto	twitter	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	was	 some 	 one 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	``	temblor	,	``	which	 mean 	 s 	 	 earth 	 quake 	 	.
so	60	 second 	 s 	 	was	how	long	it	took	for	the	physical	 earth 	 quake 	 	to	travel	.
thirty	 second 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	news	of	that	 earth 	 quake 	 	had	 travel 	 ed 	 	all	around	the	world	,	 instant 	 ly 	 	.	 every 	 one 	 	in	the	world	,	 hypothetical 	 ly 	 	,	had	the	potential	to	know	that	an	 earth 	 quake 	 	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	managua	.
and	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	one	person	had	a	 document 	 ary 	 	instinct	,	which	was	to	post	a	 stat 	 us 	 	update	,	which	is	what	we	all	do	now	,	so	if	 some 	 thing 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	,	we	put	our	 stat 	 us 	 	update	,	or	we	post	a	photo	,	we	post	a	video	,	and	it	all	 go 	 es 	 	up	 in 	 to 	 	the	cloud	in	a	constant	stream	.
and	what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	is	just	constant	,	huge	 volume 	 s 	 	of	data	going	up	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 stagger 	 ing 	 	.	when	you	look	at	the	 number 	 s 	 	,	every	minute	there	are	72	more	 hour 	 s 	 	of	video	on	youtube	.
so	that	's	,	every	second	,	more	than	an	hour	of	video	 get 	 s 	 	 upload 	 ed 	 	.
and	in	 photo 	 s 	 	,	instagram	,	58	 photo 	 s 	 	are	 upload 	 ed 	 	to	instagram	a	second	.
more	than	three	and	a	half	thousand	 photo 	 s 	 	go	up	onto	facebook	.
so	by	the	time	i	'm	 finish 	 ed 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	here	,	there	'll	be	864	more	 hour 	 s 	 	of	video	on	youtube	than	there	 we 	 re 	 	when	i	 start 	 ed 	 	,	and	two	and	a	half	million	more	 photo 	 s 	 	on	facebook	and	instagram	than	when	i	 start 	 ed 	 	.
so	it	's	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	position	to	be	in	 a 	 s 	 	a	journalist	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	should	have	access	to	 every 	 thing 	 	.
any	event	that	 happen 	 s 	 	 any 	 where 	 	in	the	world	,	i	should	be	able	to	know	about	it	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 instantaneous 	 ly 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 happen 	 s 	 	,	for	free	.
and	that	 go 	 es 	 	for	every	single	person	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	problem	is	,	when	you	have	that	much	information	,	you	have	to	find	the	good	stuff	,	and	that	can	be	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	difficult	when	you	're	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	 t 	 hose 	 	 volume 	 s 	 	.
and	 no 	 where 	 	was	 th 	 is 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	home	more	than	 dur 	 ing 	 	hurricane	 sand 	 y 	 	.	so	what	you	had	in	hurricane	 sand 	 y 	 	was	a	superstorm	,	the	 like 	 s 	 	of	which	we	had	n't	 s 	 een 	 	for	a	long	time	,	hitting	the	iphone	capital	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	--	--	and	you	got	 volume 	 s 	 	of	media	like	we	'd	never	 s 	 een 	 	before	.
and	that	 me 	 ant 	 	that	 journalist 	 s 	 	had	to	deal	with	 fake 	 s 	 	,	so	we	had	to	deal	with	old	 photo 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	reposted	.
we	had	to	deal	with	composite	 image 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 mer 	 ging 	 	 photo 	 s 	 	from	previous	 storm 	 s 	 	.
we	had	to	deal	with	 image 	 s 	 	from	 film 	 s 	 	like	``	the	day	after	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	.	``	and	we	had	to	deal	with	 image 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	so	realistic	it	was	 near 	 ly 	 	difficult	to	tell	if	they	 we 	 re 	 	real	at	all	.	but	 jok 	 ing 	 	 a 	 side 	 	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	 image 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	one	from	instagram	which	was	 subject 	 ed 	 	to	a	 grill 	 ing 	 	by	 journalist 	 s 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	.	it	was	 filter 	 ed 	 	in	instagram	.
the	 light 	 ing 	 	was	 question 	 ed 	 	.	 every 	 thing 	 	was	 question 	 ed 	 	about	it	.
and	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	true	.	it	was	from	 a 	 venue 	 	c	in	 down 	 town 	 	manhattan	,	which	was	 flood 	 ed 	 	.
and	the	reason	that	they	could	tell	that	it	was	real	was	 be 	 cause 	 	they	could	get	to	the	source	,	and	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	these	 guy 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	new	york	food	 blogger 	 s 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	well	 respect 	 ed 	 	.	they	 we 	 re 	 	known	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	one	was	n't	a	debunk	,	it	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	they	could	prove	.
and	that	was	the	job	of	the	journalist	.	it	was	 filter 	 ing 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	.
and	you	 we 	 re 	 	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	going	and	 find 	 ing 	 	the	information	and	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	it	back	to	the	 read 	 er 	 	,	you	 we 	 re 	 	 hold 	 ing 	 	back	the	stuff	that	was	 potential 	 ly 	 	 dam 	 aging 	 	.
and	 find 	 ing 	 	the	source	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	more	and	more	 import 	 ant 	 	--	 find 	 ing 	 	the	good	source	--	and	twitter	is	where	most	 journalist 	 s 	 	now	go	.
it	's	like	the	de	 fact 	 o 	 	real	-	time	newswire	,	if	you	know	how	to	use	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	is	so	much	on	twitter	.
and	a	good	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	how	 use 	 ful 	 	it	can	be	but	 al 	 so 	 	how	difficult	was	the	egyptian	revolution	in	2011	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	non	-	arabic	speaker	,	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 one 	 	who	was	looking	from	the	 out 	 side 	 	,	from	dublin	,	twitter	 list 	 s 	 	,	and	 list 	 s 	 	of	good	 source 	 s 	 	,	people	we	could	establish	 we 	 re 	 	credible	,	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
and	how	do	you	build	a	list	like	that	from	scratch	?
well	,	it	can	be	 quit 	 e 	 	difficult	,	but	you	have	to	know	what	to	look	for	.
 th 	 is 	 	 visual 	 ization 	 	was	 d 	 one 	 	by	an	italian	academic	.
he	's	 call 	 ed 	 	andr√©	pannison	,	and	he	 bas 	 ically 	 	took	the	twitter	conversation	in	tahrir	square	on	the	day	that	hosni	mubarak	would	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 re 	 sign 	 	,	and	the	 dot 	 s 	 	you	can	see	are	retweets	,	so	when	 some 	 one 	 	retweets	a	 mess 	 age 	 	,	a	 connect 	 ion 	 	is	made	between	two	 dot 	 s 	 	,	and	the	more	 time 	 s 	 	that	 mess 	 age 	 	is	retweeted	by	other	people	,	the	more	you	get	to	see	these	 nod 	 es 	 	,	these	 connect 	 ions 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	made	.
and	it	's	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	way	of	 visual 	 izing 	 	the	conversation	,	but	what	you	get	is	 hint 	 s 	 	at	who	is	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	and	who	is	worth	 invest 	 ig 	 ating 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	the	conversation	grew	and	grew	,	it	 be 	 came 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	huge	,	big	,	 rhythm 	 ic 	 	 point 	 er 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	conversation	.
you	could	find	the	 nod 	 es 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	and	then	you	went	,	and	you	go	,	``	right	,	i	've	got	to	investigate	these	people	.
these	are	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	are	 obvious 	 ly 	 	making	sense	.
let	's	see	who	they	are	.	``	now	in	the	 del 	 uge 	 	of	information	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	the	real	-	time	web	 get 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	for	a	journalist	like	 my 	 self 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	more	 tool 	 s 	 	than	ever	to	do	that	kind	of	investigation	.
and	when	you	start	 dig 	 ging 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 source 	 s 	 	,	you	can	go	further	and	further	than	you	ever	could	before	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	you	come	 a 	 cross 	 	a	piece	of	content	that	is	so	 compel 	 ling 	 	,	you	want	to	use	it	,	you	're	 dy 	 ing 	 	to	use	it	,	but	you	're	not	100	percent	 s 	 ure 	 	if	you	can	 be 	 cause 	 	you	do	n't	know	if	the	source	is	credible	.
you	do	n't	know	if	it	's	a	 scrap 	 e 	 	.	you	do	n't	know	if	it	's	a	re	-	upload	.
and	you	have	to	do	that	 invest 	 ig 	 ative 	 	work	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	video	,	which	i	'm	going	to	let	run	through	,	was	one	we	 discover 	 ed 	 	a	couple	of	 week 	 s 	 	ago	.
video	:	 get 	 ting 	 	real	 wind 	 y 	 	in	just	a	second	.
oh	,	shit	!
markham	nolan	:	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	now	if	you	're	a	news	 produce 	 r 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	you	'd	love	to	run	with	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	gold	.
you	know	?	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	fantastic	 re 	 action 	 	from	 some 	 one 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	genuine	video	that	they	've	shot	in	 the 	 ir 	 	back	garden	.
but	how	do	you	find	if	 th 	 is 	 	person	,	if	it	's	true	,	if	it	's	 fak 	 ed 	 	,	or	if	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	old	and	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	reposted	?
so	we	set	about	going	to	work	on	 th 	 is 	 	video	,	and	the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	that	we	had	to	go	on	was	the	 user 	 name 	 	on	the	youtube	account	.
there	was	 on 	 ly 	 	one	video	 post 	 ed 	 	to	that	account	,	and	the	 user 	 name 	 	was	rita	 k 	 r 	 ill 	 	.
and	we	did	n't	know	if	rita	 exist 	 ed 	 	or	if	it	was	a	fake	name	.
but	we	 start 	 ed 	 	looking	,	and	we	used	free	 inter 	 net 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	to	do	so	.
the	first	one	was	 call 	 ed 	 	spokeo	,	which	 allow 	 ed 	 	us	to	look	for	rita	krills	.	so	we	 look 	 ed 	 	all	over	the	u.s.	we	found	them	in	new	york	,	we	found	them	in	pennsylvania	,	nevada	and	florida	.
so	we	went	and	we	 look 	 ed 	 	for	a	second	free	 inter 	 net 	 	tool	 call 	 ed 	 	wolfram	alpha	,	and	we	 check 	 ed 	 	the	weather	 report 	 s 	 	for	the	day	in	which	 th 	 is 	 	video	had	 be 	 en 	 	 upload 	 ed 	 	,	and	when	we	went	through	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 vari 	 ous 	 	cities	,	we	found	that	in	florida	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	thunderstorms	and	rain	on	the	day	.
so	we	went	to	the	white	 page 	 s 	 	,	and	we	found	,	we	 look 	 ed 	 	through	the	rita	krills	in	the	 phone 	 book 	 	,	and	we	 look 	 ed 	 	through	a	couple	of	different	 address 	 es 	 	,	and	that	took	us	to	google	 map 	 s 	 	,	where	we	found	a	house	.
and	we	found	a	house	with	a	 swimm 	 ing 	 	pool	that	 look 	 ed 	 	 remark 	 ably 	 	like	rita	's	.	so	we	went	back	to	the	video	,	and	we	had	to	look	for	 clue 	 s 	 	that	we	could	cross	-	 re 	 ference 	 	.
so	if	you	look	in	the	video	,	there	's	the	big	 um 	 br 	 ella 	 	,	there	's	a	white	lilo	in	the	pool	,	there	are	some	 un 	 usual 	 ly 	 	 round 	 ed 	 	 edge 	 s 	 	in	the	 swimm 	 ing 	 	pool	,	and	there	's	two	 tree 	 s 	 	in	the	 back 	 ground 	 	.
and	we	went	back	to	google	 map 	 s 	 	,	and	we	 look 	 ed 	 	a	little	bit	 close 	 r 	 	,	and	 s 	 ure 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	there	's	the	white	lilo	,	there	are	the	two	 tree 	 s 	 	,	there	's	the	 um 	 br 	 ella 	 	.	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 fold 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	photo	.
little	bit	of	 trick 	 ery 	 	.	and	there	are	the	 round 	 ed 	 	 edge 	 s 	 	on	the	 swimm 	 ing 	 	pool	.
so	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	call	rita	,	clear	the	video	,	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	it	had	 be 	 en 	 	shot	,	and	then	our	 client 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 de 	 light 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	run	it	 with 	 out 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 worri 	 ed 	 	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	the	search	for	truth	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	is	a	little	bit	less	flippant	,	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	much	 great 	 er 	 	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	.
syria	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	for	us	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 obvious 	 ly 	 	a	lot	of	the	time	you	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	debunk	stuff	that	can	be	 potential 	 ly 	 	war	crime	evidence	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	youtube	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 re 	 posit 	 ory 	 	of	information	about	what	's	going	on	in	the	world	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	video	,	i	'm	not	going	to	show	you	the	whole	thing	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	gruesome	,	but	you	'll	hear	some	of	the	 sound 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	from	hama	.	video	:	and	what	 th 	 is 	 	video	 show 	 s 	 	,	when	you	watch	the	whole	thing	through	,	is	 blood 	 y 	 	bodies	 be 	 ing 	 	taken	out	of	a	 pick 	 up 	 	truck	and	 throw 	 n 	 	off	a	bridge	.
the	 al 	 leg 	 ations 	 	 we 	 re 	 	that	these	 guy 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	muslim	brotherhood	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 throw 	 ing 	 	syrian	 arm 	 y 	 	 officer 	 s 	 	'	bodies	off	the	bridge	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	cursing	and	using	 blasphem 	 ous 	 	language	,	and	there	 we 	 re 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	counterclaims	about	who	they	 we 	 re 	 	,	and	 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	they	 we 	 re 	 	what	the	video	 s 	 aid 	 	it	was	.
so	we	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	some	 source 	 s 	 	in	hama	who	we	had	 be 	 en 	 	back	and	forth	with	on	twitter	,	and	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	the	bridge	was	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	us	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	 some 	 thing 	 	we	could	identify	.
three	different	 source 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	three	different	 thing 	 s 	 	about	the	bridge	.
they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	one	,	the	bridge	 do 	 es 	 	n't	exist	.
 an 	 other 	 	one	 s 	 aid 	 	the	bridge	 do 	 es 	 	exist	,	but	it	's	not	in	hama	.	it	's	 some 	 where 	 	else	.
and	the	third	one	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	think	the	bridge	 do 	 es 	 	exist	,	but	the	dam	 up 	 stream 	 	of	the	bridge	was	closed	,	so	the	river	should	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	dry	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	sense	.	``
so	that	was	the	 on 	 ly 	 	one	that	 g 	 ave 	 	us	a	clue	.
we	 look 	 ed 	 	through	the	video	for	other	 clue 	 s 	 	.
we	saw	the	 distinct 	 ive 	 	railings	,	which	we	could	use	.
we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	curbs	.	the	curbs	 we 	 re 	 	 throw 	 ing 	 	 shadow 	 s 	 	south	,	so	we	could	tell	the	bridge	was	running	east	-	west	 a 	 cross 	 	the	river	.
it	had	black	-	and	-	white	curbs	.
 a 	 s 	 	we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	river	 it 	 self 	 	,	you	could	see	there	's	a	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	stone	on	the	west	side	.	there	's	a	cloud	of	blood	.
that	's	blood	in	the	river	.	so	the	river	is	 flow 	 ing 	 	south	to	north	.	that	's	what	that	 tell 	 s 	 	me	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	look	away	from	the	bridge	,	there	's	a	divot	on	the	left	-	hand	side	of	the	bank	,	and	the	river	 narrow 	 s 	 	.
so	onto	google	 map 	 s 	 	we	go	,	and	we	start	looking	through	 liter 	 ally 	 	every	single	bridge	.
we	go	to	the	dam	that	we	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	,	we	start	just	 liter 	 ally 	 	going	through	every	time	that	road	 cross 	 es 	 	the	river	,	 cross 	 ing 	 	off	the	 bridge 	 s 	 	that	do	n't	match	.
we	're	looking	for	one	that	 cross 	 es 	 	east	-	west	.
and	we	get	to	hama	.	we	get	all	the	way	from	the	dam	to	hama	and	there	's	no	bridge	.
so	we	go	a	bit	further	.	we	 s 	 witch 	 	to	the	satellite	view	,	and	we	find	 an 	 other 	 	bridge	,	and	 every 	 thing 	 	 start 	 s 	 	to	line	up	.
the	bridge	 look 	 s 	 	like	it	's	 cross 	 ing 	 	the	river	east	to	west	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	could	be	our	bridge	.	and	we	zoom	right	in	.
we	start	to	see	that	it	's	got	a	 med 	 ian 	 	,	so	it	's	a	two	-	lane	bridge	.
and	it	's	got	the	black	-	and	-	white	curbs	that	we	saw	in	the	video	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	we	click	through	it	,	you	can	see	 some 	 one 	 	's	 upload 	 ed 	 	 photo 	 s 	 	to	go	with	the	map	,	which	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 hand 	 y 	 	,	so	we	click	 in 	 to 	 	the	 photo 	 s 	 	.	and	the	 photo 	 s 	 	start	 show 	 ing 	 	us	more	detail	that	we	can	cross	-	 re 	 ference 	 	with	the	video	.
the	first	thing	that	we	see	is	we	see	black	-	and	-	white	curbing	,	which	is	 hand 	 y 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	that	before	.
we	see	the	 distinct 	 ive 	 	railing	that	we	saw	the	 guy 	 s 	 	 throw 	 ing 	 	the	bodies	over	.
and	we	keep	going	through	it	 un 	 til 	 	we	're	certain	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	our	bridge	.
so	what	 do 	 es 	 	that	tell	me	?	i	've	got	to	go	back	now	to	my	three	 source 	 s 	 	and	look	at	what	they	told	me	:	the	one	who	 s 	 aid 	 	the	bridge	did	n't	exist	,	the	one	who	 s 	 aid 	 	the	bridge	was	n't	in	hama	,	and	the	one	guy	who	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	the	bridge	 do 	 es 	 	exist	,	but	i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	about	the	water	 level 	 s 	 	.	``	number	three	is	looking	like	the	most	 truth 	 ful 	 	all	of	a	sudden	,	and	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	find	that	out	using	some	free	 inter 	 net 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	a	 cubic 	 le 	 	in	an	 off 	 ice 	 	in	dublin	in	the	space	of	20	 minute 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	part	of	the	joy	of	 th 	 is 	 	.	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	the	web	is	running	like	a	 tor 	 rent 	 	,	there	's	so	much	information	there	that	it	's	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	hard	to	sift	and	 get 	 ting 	 	 hard 	 er 	 	every	day	,	if	you	use	them	 intelligent 	 ly 	 	,	you	can	find	out	 in 	 credible 	 	information	.
 give 	 n 	 	a	couple	of	 clue 	 s 	 	,	i	could	 prob 	 ably 	 	find	out	a	lot	of	 thing 	 s 	 	about	most	of	you	in	the	audience	that	you	might	not	like	me	 find 	 ing 	 	out	.
but	what	it	 tell 	 s 	 	me	is	that	,	at	a	time	when	there	's	more	--	there	's	a	 great 	 er 	 	abundance	of	information	than	there	ever	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	,	it	's	 hard 	 er 	 	to	filter	,	we	have	 great 	 er 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	.
we	have	free	 inter 	 net 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	that	allow	us	,	help	us	do	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	investigation	.
we	have	 algorithm 	 s 	 	that	are	 smart 	 er 	 	than	ever	before	,	and	 computer 	 s 	 	that	are	 quick 	 er 	 	than	ever	before	.
but	here	's	the	thing	.	 algorithm 	 s 	 	are	 rule 	 s 	 	.	they	're	 bin 	 ary 	 	.
they	're	 y 	 es 	 	or	no	,	they	're	black	or	white	.
truth	is	never	 bin 	 ary 	 	.	truth	is	a	value	.
truth	is	 emotion 	 al 	 	,	it	's	fluid	,	and	above	all	,	it	's	human	.
no	matter	how	quick	we	get	with	 computer 	 s 	 	,	no	matter	how	much	information	we	have	,	you	'll	never	be	able	to	 re 	 move 	 	the	human	from	the	truth	-	seeking	 exercis 	 e 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	in	the	end	,	it	is	a	 un 	 ique 	 ly 	 	human	trait	.
 thank 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
