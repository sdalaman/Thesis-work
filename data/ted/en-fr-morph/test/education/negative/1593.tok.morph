i	'm	here	to	talk	to	you	about	how	 global 	 ized 	 	we	are	,	how	 global 	 ized 	 	we	are	n't	,	and	why	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	accurate	in	making	 t 	 hose 	 	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 assess 	 ments 	 	.
and	the	 lead 	 ing 	 	point	of	view	on	 th 	 is 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	 measur 	 ed 	 	by	number	of	 book 	 s 	 	 s 	 old 	 	,	 ment 	 ions 	 	in	media	,	or	 survey 	 s 	 	that	i	've	run	with	 group 	 s 	 	ranging	from	my	 student 	 s 	 	to	delegates	to	the	world	trade	 organ 	 ization 	 	,	is	 th 	 is 	 	view	that	national	 border 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	do	n't	matter	 ver 	 y 	 	much	 any 	 more 	 	,	cross	-	border	 integ 	 ration 	 	is	close	to	complete	,	and	we	live	in	one	world	.
and	what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	view	is	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	it	's	a	view	that	's	held	by	pro	-	globalizers	like	tom	friedman	,	from	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	book	 th 	 is 	 	quote	is	 obvious 	 ly 	 	excerpted	,	but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	held	by	anti	-	globalizers	,	who	see	 th 	 is 	 	giant	 global 	 ization 	 	tsunami	that	's	about	to	wreck	all	our	 live 	 s 	 	if	it	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 al 	 ready 	 	 d 	 one 	 	so	.
the	other	thing	i	would	add	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	new	view	.
i	'm	a	little	bit	of	an	amateur	historian	,	so	i	've	 s 	 pent 	 	some	time	going	back	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	see	the	first	 ment 	 ion 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	thing	.	and	the	best	,	 ear 	 liest 	 	quote	that	i	could	find	was	one	from	david	livingstone	,	writing	in	the	1850s	about	how	the	 rail 	 road 	 	,	the	 s 	 team 	 	ship	,	and	the	 tele 	 graph 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 integ 	 rating 	 	east	africa	 perfect 	 ly 	 	with	the	rest	of	the	world	.
now	 clear 	 ly 	 	,	david	livingstone	was	a	little	bit	 a 	 head 	 	of	his	time	,	but	it	 do 	 es 	 	seem	 use 	 ful 	 	to	ask	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	``	just	how	global	are	we	?	``	before	we	think	about	where	we	go	from	here	.
so	the	best	way	i	've	found	of	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	people	to	take	 serious 	 ly 	 	the	idea	that	the	world	may	not	be	flat	,	may	not	even	be	close	to	flat	,	is	with	some	data	.
so	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	over	the	last	few	 year 	 s 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 compil 	 ing 	 	data	on	 thing 	 s 	 	that	could	either	happen	 with 	 in 	 	national	 border 	 s 	 	or	 a 	 cross 	 	national	 border 	 s 	 	,	and	i	've	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	cross	-	border	component	 a 	 s 	 	a	 percent 	 age 	 	of	the	total	.
i	'm	not	going	to	present	all	the	data	that	i	have	here	 to 	 day 	 	,	but	let	me	just	give	you	a	few	data	 point 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	talk	a	little	bit	about	one	kind	of	information	flow	,	one	kind	of	flow	of	people	,	one	kind	of	flow	of	capital	,	and	,	of	course	,	trade	in	 product 	 s 	 	and	 service 	 s 	 	.
so	let	's	start	off	with	plain	old	 tele 	 phone 	 	service	.
of	all	the	voice	-	 call 	 ing 	 	 minute 	 s 	 	in	the	world	last	year	,	what	 percent 	 age 	 	do	you	think	 we 	 re 	 	 account 	 ed 	 	for	by	cross	-	border	phone	 call 	 s 	 	?
pick	a	 percent 	 age 	 	in	your	own	mind	.
the	answer	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	be	two	percent	.
if	you	include	 inter 	 net 	 	 tele 	 phony 	 	,	you	might	be	able	to	push	 th 	 is 	 	number	up	to	six	or	seven	percent	,	but	it	's	 no 	 where 	 	near	what	people	tend	to	estimate	.
or	let	's	turn	to	people	moving	 a 	 cross 	 	 border 	 s 	 	.
one	 part 	 icular 	 	thing	we	might	look	at	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	long	-	term	 flow 	 s 	 	of	people	,	is	what	 percent 	 age 	 	of	the	world	's	population	is	 account 	 ed 	 	for	by	first	-	generation	 im 	 migrant 	 s 	 	?
 aga 	 in 	 	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	pick	a	 percent 	 age 	 	.
 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	be	a	little	bit	 high 	 er 	 	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	about	three	percent	.
or	think	of	 invest 	 ment 	 	.	take	all	the	real	 invest 	 ment 	 	that	went	on	in	the	world	in	2010	.
what	 percent 	 age 	 	of	that	was	 account 	 ed 	 	for	by	foreign	direct	 invest 	 ment 	 	?
not	 quit 	 e 	 	ten	percent	.
and	then	 final 	 ly 	 	,	the	one	statistic	that	i	suspect	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	people	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	have	 s 	 een 	 	:	the	export	-	to	-	gdp	ratio	.
if	you	look	at	the	official	 statistic 	 s 	 	,	they	 typical 	 ly 	 	 indic 	 ate 	 	a	little	bit	above	30	percent	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	there	's	a	big	problem	with	the	official	 statistic 	 s 	 	,	in	that	if	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	a	japanese	component	 suppli 	 er 	 	 ship 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	to	 chin 	 a 	 	to	be	put	 in 	 to 	 	an	ipod	,	and	then	the	ipod	 get 	 s 	 	 ship 	 ped 	 	to	the	u.s.	,	that	component	 end 	 s 	 	up	 get 	 ting 	 	 count 	 ed 	 	 multi 	 ple 	 	 time 	 s 	 	.
so	 no 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	how	bad	 th 	 is 	 	bias	with	the	official	 statistic 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	is	,	so	i	thought	i	would	ask	the	person	who	's	 spear 	 head 	 ing 	 	the	effort	to	generate	data	on	 th 	 is 	 	,	pascal	lamy	,	the	director	of	the	world	trade	 organ 	 ization 	 	,
what	his	best	guess	would	be	of	 export 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 percent 	 age 	 	of	gdp	,	 with 	 out 	 	the	double	-	and	triple	-	 count 	 ing 	 	,
and	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 prob 	 ably 	 	a	bit	under	20	percent	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	the	30	percent	-	plus	 number 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	.
so	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	that	if	you	look	at	these	 number 	 s 	 	or	all	the	other	 number 	 s 	 	that	i	talk	about	in	my	book	,	``	world	3.0	,	``	that	we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	far	from	the	no	-	border	effect	 bench 	 mark 	 	,	which	would	 imp 	 ly 	 	internationalization	 level 	 s 	 	of	the	order	of	85	,	90	,	95	percent	.
so	 clear 	 ly 	 	,	apocalyptically	-	minded	 author 	 s 	 	have	 over 	 state 	 d 	 	the	case	.
but	it	's	not	just	the	apocalyptics	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	think	of	them	,	who	are	prone	to	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	overstatement	.
i	've	 al 	 so 	 	 s 	 pent 	 	some	time	 survey 	 ing 	 	 audience 	 s 	 	in	different	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	world	on	what	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	guess	these	 number 	 s 	 	to	be	.
let	me	share	with	you	the	 result 	 s 	 	of	a	survey	that	harvard	business	review	was	kind	 en 	 ough 	 	to	run	of	 it 	 s 	 	 read 	 er 	 ship 	 	 a 	 s 	 	to	what	people	's	 guess 	 es 	 	 a 	 long 	 	these	 dimension 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 we 	 re 	 	.
so	a	couple	of	 observ 	 ations 	 	stand	out	for	me	from	 th 	 is 	 	slide	.
first	of	all	,	there	is	a	 suggest 	 ion 	 	of	some	error	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
second	,	these	are	 pre 	 tty 	 	large	 error 	 s 	 	.	for	four	 quant 	 ities 	 	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	average	value	is	less	than	10	percent	,	you	have	people	 guess 	 ing 	 	three	,	four	 time 	 s 	 	that	level	.
even	 th 	 ough 	 	i	'm	an	economist	,	i	find	that	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	large	error	.
and	third	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	just	 con 	 fin 	 ed 	 	to	the	 read 	 ers 	 	of	the	harvard	business	review	.
i	've	run	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	dozen	 s 	 uch 	 	 survey 	 s 	 	in	different	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	world	,	and	in	all	 case 	 s 	 	 ex 	 cept 	 	one	,	where	a	group	 actual 	 ly 	 	 under 	 estimate 	 d 	 	the	trade	-	to	-	gdp	ratio	,	people	have	 th 	 is 	 	 tend 	 ency 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 over 	 estimation 	 	,	and	so	i	thought	it	 import 	 ant 	 	to	give	a	name	to	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	that	's	what	i	refer	to	 a 	 s 	 	globaloney	,	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	the	dark	blue	 bar 	 s 	 	and	the	light	gray	 bar 	 s 	 	.
 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	,	i	suspect	,	some	of	you	may	still	be	a	little	bit	 skeptic 	 al 	 	of	the	 claim 	 s 	 	,	i	think	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	just	 s 	 pend 	 	a	little	bit	of	time	 think 	 ing 	 	about	why	we	might	be	prone	to	globaloney	.
a	couple	of	different	 reason 	 s 	 	come	to	mind	.
first	of	all	,	there	's	a	real	 d 	 earth 	 	of	data	in	the	debate	.
let	me	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	.	when	i	first	 publish 	 ed 	 	some	of	these	data	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	in	a	magazine	 call 	 ed 	 	foreign	policy	,	one	of	the	people	who	wrote	in	,	not	 entire 	 ly 	 	in	 agree 	 ment 	 	,	was	tom	friedman	.	and	since	my	article	was	titled	``	why	the	world	is	n't	flat	,	``	that	was	n't	too	surprising	.
what	was	 ver 	 y 	 	surprising	to	me	was	tom	's	critique	,	which	was	,	``	ghemawat	's	data	are	narrow	.	``
and	 th 	 is 	 	 caus 	 ed 	 	me	to	scratch	my	head	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 a 	 s 	 	i	went	back	through	his	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	-	hundred	-	page	book	,	i	could	n't	find	a	single	figure	,	chart	,	table	,	 re 	 ference 	 	or	 foot 	 note 	 	.
so	my	point	is	,	i	have	n't	 present 	 ed 	 	a	lot	of	data	here	to	 con 	 vince 	 	you	that	i	'm	right	,	but	i	would	urge	you	to	go	away	and	look	for	your	own	data	to	try	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	assess	 whet 	 her 	 	some	of	these	hand	-	me	-	down	 in 	 sight 	 s 	 	that	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 bombard 	 ed 	 	with	 actual 	 ly 	 	are	correct	.
so	 d 	 earth 	 	of	data	in	the	debate	is	one	reason	.
a	second	reason	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	with	peer	pressure	.
i	remember	,	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	write	my	``	why	the	world	is	n't	flat	``	article	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	 be 	 ing 	 	 interview 	 ed 	 	on	tv	in	mumbai	,	and	the	 interview 	 er 	 	's	first	question	to	me	was	,	``	professor	ghemawat	,	why	do	you	still	 believ 	 e 	 	that	the	world	is	round	?	``	and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 laugh 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	had	n't	come	 a 	 cross 	 	that	 formula 	 tion 	 	before	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	was	 laugh 	 ing 	 	,	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	,	i	 re 	 ally 	 	need	a	more	 cohere 	 nt 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	on	national	tv	.	i	'd	better	write	 some 	 thing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	what	i	ca	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	capture	for	you	was	the	 p 	 ity 	 	and	 dis 	 belief 	 	with	which	the	 interview 	 er 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	her	question	.
the	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	was	,	here	is	 th 	 is 	 	poor	professor	.
he	's	 clear 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	in	a	cave	for	the	last	20,000	 year 	 s 	 	.
he	 re 	 ally 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	no	idea	 a 	 s 	 	to	what	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	on	in	the	world	.
so	try	 th 	 is 	 	out	with	your	 friend 	 s 	 	and	 acquaint 	 ance 	 s 	 	,
if	you	like	.	you	'll	find	that	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	cool	to	talk	about	the	world	 be 	 ing 	 	one	,	etc	.
if	you	raise	 question 	 s 	 	about	that	 formula 	 tion 	 	,	you	 re 	 ally 	 	are	 consider 	 ed 	 	a	bit	of	an	 anti 	 que 	 	.
and	then	the	final	reason	,	which	i	 ment 	 ion 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	to	a	ted	audience	,	with	some	 trepid 	 ation 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	with	what	i	call	``	techno	-	trances	.	``
if	you	listen	to	techno	music	for	long	 period 	 s 	 	of	time	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	to	your	 brain 	 wave 	 	activity	.
 some 	 thing 	 	similar	 seem 	 s 	 	to	happen	with	 exagge 	 rated 	 	 conception 	 s 	 	of	how	technology	is	going	to	 over 	 power 	 	in	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 im 	 mediate 	 	run	all	cultural	 bar 	 rier 	 s 	 	,	all	 politic 	 al 	 	 bar 	 rier 	 s 	 	,	all	 geo 	 graphic 	 	 bar 	 rier 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	i	know	you	are	n't	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	ask	me	 question 	 s 	 	,	but	when	i	get	to	 th 	 is 	 	point	in	my	 lectur 	 e 	 	with	my	 student 	 s 	 	,	 hand 	 s 	 	go	up	,	and	people	ask	me	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	,	but	what	about	facebook	?	``
and	i	got	 th 	 is 	 	question	often	 en 	 ough 	 	that	i	thought	i	'd	better	do	some	research	on	facebook	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	in	some	sense	,	it	's	the	ideal	kind	of	technology	to	think	about	.	 theoretic 	 ally 	 	,	it	 make 	 s 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	easy	to	form	 friend 	 ship 	 s 	 	 half 	 way 	 	around	the	world	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	right	next	door	.
what	 percent 	 age 	 	of	people	's	 friend 	 s 	 	on	facebook	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 locate 	 d 	 	in	 count 	 ries 	 	other	than	where	people	we	're	 analyz 	 ing 	 	are	based	?
the	answer	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	 some 	 where 	 	between	10	to	15	percent	.
non	-	 neglig 	 ible 	 	,	so	we	do	n't	live	in	an	 entire 	 ly 	 	local	or	national	world	,	but	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	far	from	the	95	percent	level	that	you	would	expect	,	and	the	reason	's	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	.
we	do	n't	,	or	i	hope	we	do	n't	,	form	 friend 	 ship 	 s 	 	at	random	on	facebook	.	the	technology	is	 over 	 laid 	 	on	a	pre	-	 exist 	 ing 	 	 m 	 atrix 	 	of	 relationship 	 s 	 	that	we	have	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	 relationship 	 s 	 	are	what	the	technology	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	 dis 	 place 	 	.	 t 	 hose 	 	 relationship 	 s 	 	are	why	we	get	far	 few 	 er 	 	than	95	percent	of	our	 friend 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 locate 	 d 	 	in	 count 	 ries 	 	other	than	where	we	are	.
so	 do 	 es 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	matter	?	or	is	globaloney	just	a	 harm 	 less 	 	way	of	 get 	 ting 	 	people	to	pay	more	attention	to	 global 	 ization 	 	-	related	 issue 	 s 	 	?
i	want	to	suggest	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	globaloney	can	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 harm 	 ful 	 	to	your	health	.
first	of	all	,	 recogn 	 izing 	 	that	the	glass	is	 on 	 ly 	 	10	to	20	percent	full	is	critical	to	 see 	 ing 	 	that	there	might	be	potential	for	 add 	 ition 	 al 	 	 gain 	 s 	 	from	 add 	 ition 	 al 	 	 integ 	 ration 	 	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	if	we	thought	we	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	there	,	there	would	be	no	 part 	 icular 	 	point	to	 push 	 ing 	 	 hard 	 er 	 	.
it	's	a	little	bit	like	,	we	would	n't	be	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	 con 	 ference 	 	on	radical	 open 	 ness 	 	if	we	 al 	 ready 	 	thought	we	 we 	 re 	 	 total 	 ly 	 	open	to	all	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 influence 	 s 	 	that	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	at	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	.
so	 be 	 ing 	 	accurate	about	how	 limit 	 ed 	 	 global 	 ization 	 	 level 	 s 	 	are	is	critical	to	even	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	notice	that	there	might	be	room	for	 some 	 thing 	 	more	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	would	 con 	 tribute 	 	further	to	global	 wel 	 fare 	 	.
which	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	me	to	my	second	point	.
 avoid 	 ing 	 	overstatement	is	 al 	 so 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 help 	 ful 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 reduc 	 es 	 	and	in	some	 case 	 s 	 	even	 reverse 	 s 	 	some	of	the	 fear 	 s 	 	that	people	have	about	 global 	 ization 	 	.
so	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 pend 	 	most	of	my	``	world	3.0	``	book	 work 	 ing 	 	through	a	 lit 	 any 	 	of	market	 failure 	 s 	 	and	 fear 	 s 	 	that	people	have	that	they	worry	 global 	 ization 	 	is	going	to	exacerbate	.
i	'm	 obvious 	 ly 	 	not	going	to	be	able	to	do	that	for	you	 to 	 day 	 	,	so	let	me	just	present	to	you	two	 head 	 lines 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	 illustr 	 ation 	 	of	what	i	have	in	mind	.
think	of	france	and	the	current	debate	about	 im 	 migr 	 ation 	 	.
when	you	ask	people	in	france	what	 percent 	 age 	 	of	the	french	population	is	 im 	 migrant 	 s 	 	,	the	answer	is	about	24	percent	.	that	's	 the 	 ir 	 	guess	.
 may 	 be 	 	 real 	 izing 	 	that	the	number	is	just	eight	percent	might	help	cool	some	of	the	 super 	 heated 	 	rhetoric	that	we	see	around	the	 im 	 migr 	 ation 	 	issue	.
or	to	take	an	even	more	 s 	 tri 	 king 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	when	the	chicago	council	on	foreign	 relation 	 s 	 	did	a	survey	of	americans	,	 ask 	 ing 	 	them	to	guess	what	 percent 	 age 	 	of	the	federal	budget	went	to	foreign	aid	,	the	guess	was	30	percent	,	which	is	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	in	excess	of	the	actual	level	--	--	of	u.s.	 government 	 al 	 	 commit 	 ments 	 	to	federal	aid	.
the	 re 	 assur 	 ing 	 	thing	about	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	survey	was	,	when	it	was	 point 	 ed 	 	out	to	people	how	far	 the 	 ir 	 	 estimate 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	from	the	actual	data	,	some	of	them	--	not	all	of	them	--	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	more	 will 	 ing 	 	to	consider	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	in	foreign	aid	.
so	foreign	aid	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	great	way	of	sort	of	 wrap 	 ping 	 	up	here	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	think	about	it	,	what	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 to 	 day 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	--	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 controversial 	 	 among 	 st 	 	 economist 	 s 	 	--	that	most	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	home	-	 bias 	 ed 	 	.
``	foreign	aid	is	the	most	aid	to	poor	people	,	``	is	about	the	most	home	-	 bias 	 ed 	 	thing	you	can	find	.
if	you	look	at	the	oecd	 count 	 ries 	 	and	how	much	they	 s 	 pend 	 	per	domestic	poor	person	,	and	 compar 	 e 	 	it	with	how	much	they	 s 	 pend 	 	per	poor	person	in	poor	 count 	 ries 	 	,	the	ratio	--	branko	milanovic	at	the	world	bank	did	the	 calcul 	 ations 	 	--	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	be	about	30,000	to	one	.
now	of	course	,	some	of	us	,	if	we	 tru 	 ly 	 	are	 cosmo 	 politan 	 	,	would	like	to	see	that	ratio	 be 	 ing 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	down	to	one	-	is	-	to	-	one	.
i	'd	like	to	make	the	 suggest 	 ion 	 	that	we	do	n't	need	to	aim	for	that	to	make	 sub 	 stantial 	 	progress	from	where	we	are	.
if	we	 simpl 	 y 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	that	ratio	down	to	15,000	to	one	,	we	would	be	 meet 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	aid	 target 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 agree 	 d 	 	at	the	rio	 summ 	 it 	 	20	 year 	 s 	 	ago	that	the	 summ 	 it 	 	that	 end 	 ed 	 	last	week	made	no	further	progress	on	.
so	in	 summ 	 ary 	 	,	while	radical	 open 	 ness 	 	is	great	,	 give 	 n 	 	how	closed	we	are	,	even	 increment 	 al 	 	 open 	 ness 	 	could	make	 thing 	 s 	 
 dramat 	 ically 	 	better	.	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
