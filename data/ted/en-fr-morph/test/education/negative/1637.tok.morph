one	day	in	1819	,	3,000	 mile 	 s 	 	off	the	coast	of	chile	,	in	one	of	the	most	remote	 region 	 s 	 	of	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	ocean	,	20	american	 sail 	 ors 	 	 watch 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	ship	flood	with	 sea 	 water 	 	.
they	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 truck 	 	by	a	 s 	 perm 	 	whale	,	which	had	 rip 	 ped 	 	a	 catastroph 	 ic 	 	hole	in	the	ship	's	hull	.
 a 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	ship	 beg 	 an 	 	to	sink	 be 	 neath 	 	the	 s 	 well 	 s 	 	,	the	men	 huddl 	 ed 	 	together	in	three	small	 whale 	 boat 	 s 	 	.
these	men	 we 	 re 	 	10,000	 mile 	 s 	 	from	home	,	more	than	1,000	 mile 	 s 	 	from	the	 near 	 est 	 	scrap	of	land	.
in	 the 	 ir 	 	small	 boat 	 s 	 	,	they	carried	 on 	 ly 	 	 rud 	 imentary 	 	 navig 	 ation 	 al 	 	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	and	 limit 	 ed 	 	 suppli 	 es 	 	of	food	and	water	.
these	 we 	 re 	 	the	men	of	the	 whale 	 ship 	 	essex	,	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	story	would	 lat 	 er 	 	inspire	 part 	 s 	 	of	``	moby	 d 	 ick 	 	.	``
even	in	 to 	 day 	 	's	world	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	would	be	 re 	 ally 	 	 di 	 re 	 	,	but	think	about	how	much	 wo 	 rse 	 	it	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	then	.
no	one	on	land	had	any	idea	that	 any 	 thing 	 	had	gone	wrong	.
no	search	party	was	coming	to	look	for	these	men	.
so	most	of	us	have	never	 experience 	 d 	 	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 frighten 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	one	in	which	these	 sail 	 ors 	 	found	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	but	we	all	know	what	it	's	like	to	be	 af 	 raid 	 	.
we	know	how	fear	 feel 	 s 	 	,	but	i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	we	 s 	 pend 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	time	 think 	 ing 	 	about	what	our	 fear 	 s 	 	mean	.
 a 	 s 	 	we	grow	up	,	we	're	often	 encourag 	 ed 	 	to	think	of	fear	 a 	 s 	 	a	 weak 	 ness 	 	,	just	 an 	 other 	 	 child 	 ish 	 	thing	to	 dis 	 card 	 	like	baby	 tee 	 th 	 	or	roller	 s 	 k 	 ates 	 	.
and	i	think	it	's	no	accident	that	we	think	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
 neuro 	 scientist 	 s 	 	have	 actual 	 ly 	 	 show 	 n 	 	that	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	are	hard	-	wired	to	be	 optimist 	 s 	 	.
so	 may 	 be 	 	that	's	why	we	think	of	fear	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	danger	in	and	of	 it 	 self 	 	.
``	do	n't	worry	,	``	we	like	to	say	to	one	 an 	 other 	 	.	``	do	n't	panic	.	``	in	english	,	fear	is	 some 	 thing 	 	we	conquer	.
it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	we	fight	.	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	we	 over 	 come 	 	.
but	what	if	we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	fear	in	a	fresh	way	?
what	if	we	thought	of	fear	 a 	 s 	 	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	act	of	the	 imagin 	 ation 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	can	be	 a 	 s 	 	 pro 	 found 	 	and	 in 	 sight 	 ful 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 story 	 tell 	 ing 	 	 it 	 self 	 	?
it	's	 eas 	 iest 	 	to	see	 th 	 is 	 	link	between	fear	and	the	 imagin 	 ation 	 	in	young	children	,	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 fear 	 s 	 	are	often	 extra 	 ordinari 	 ly 	 	 vivi 	 d 	 	.
when	i	was	a	child	,	i	lived	in	california	,	which	is	,	you	know	,	 most 	 ly 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	nice	place	to	live	,	but	for	me	 a 	 s 	 	a	child	,	california	could	 al 	 so 	 	be	a	little	 scar 	 y 	 	.
i	remember	how	 frighten 	 ing 	 	it	was	to	see	the	 chan 	 deli 	 er 	 	that	hung	above	our	 din 	 ing 	 	table	 s 	 wing 	 	back	and	forth	 dur 	 ing 	 	every	minor	 earth 	 quake 	 	,	and	i	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	could	n't	sleep	at	night	,	 terr 	 ified 	 	that	the	big	one	might	strike	while	we	 we 	 re 	 	 sleep 	 ing 	 	.
and	what	we	say	about	 kid 	 s 	 	who	have	 fear 	 s 	 	like	that	is	that	they	have	a	 vivi 	 d 	 	 imagin 	 ation 	 	.
but	at	a	certain	point	,	most	of	us	learn	to	 leav 	 e 	 	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 vision 	 s 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	and	grow	up	.
we	learn	that	there	are	no	 mon 	 sters 	 	 hid 	 ing 	 	under	the	bed	,	and	not	every	 earth 	 quake 	 	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	 building 	 s 	 	down	.
but	 may 	 be 	 	it	's	no	 co 	 incidence 	 	that	some	of	our	most	creative	 mind 	 s 	 	fail	to	 leav 	 e 	 	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 fear 	 s 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 adult 	 s 	 	.
the	same	 in 	 credible 	 	 imagin 	 ations 	 	that	 produce 	 d 	 	``	the	origin	of	species	,	``	``	jane	eyre	``	and	``	the	 rem 	 embr 	 ance 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	past	,	``	 al 	 so 	 	generated	 intens 	 e 	 	 worri 	 es 	 	that	 haunt 	 ed 	 	the	adult	 live 	 s 	 	of	charles	darwin	,	charlotte	brontăť	and	marcel	proust	.
so	the	question	is	,	what	can	the	rest	of	us	learn	about	fear	from	 vision 	 aries 	 	and	young	children	?
well	let	's	return	to	the	year	1819	for	a	moment	,	to	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	facing	the	crew	of	the	 whale 	 ship 	 	essex	.
let	's	take	a	look	at	the	 fear 	 s 	 	that	 the 	 ir 	 	 imagin 	 ations 	 	 we 	 re 	 	generating	 a 	 s 	 	they	 drift 	 ed 	 	in	the	middle	of	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	.
twenty	-	four	 hour 	 s 	 	had	now	 pass 	 ed 	 	since	the	 cap 	 s 	 izing 	 	of	the	ship	.
the	time	had	come	for	the	men	to	make	a	plan	,	but	they	had	 ver 	 y 	 	few	 option 	 s 	 	.
in	his	 fasci 	 nating 	 	account	of	the	disaster	,	nathaniel	philbrick	wrote	that	these	men	 we 	 re 	 	just	about	 a 	 s 	 	far	from	land	 a 	 s 	 	it	was	possible	to	be	 any 	 where 	 	on	earth	.
the	men	 k 	 new 	 	that	the	 near 	 est 	 	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	they	could	reach	 we 	 re 	 	the	marquesas	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	,	1,200	 mile 	 s 	 	away	.
but	they	'd	heard	some	 frighten 	 ing 	 	 rumor 	 s 	 	.
they	'd	 be 	 en 	 	told	that	these	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	,	and	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 other 	 s 	 	 near 	 by 	 	,	 we 	 re 	 	 populate 	 d 	 	by	 cannibal 	 s 	 	.
so	the	men	 picture 	 d 	 	coming	 a 	 shore 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	to	be	 murder 	 ed 	 	and	eaten	for	 d 	 inner 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	possible	destination	was	hawaii	,	but	 give 	 n 	 	the	season	,	the	 cap 	 tain 	 	was	 af 	 raid 	 	they	'd	be	 s 	 truck 	 	by	severe	 storm 	 s 	 	.
now	the	last	option	was	the	 long 	 est 	 	,	and	the	most	difficult	:	to	sail	1,500	 mile 	 s 	 	due	south	in	 hope 	 s 	 	of	 reach 	 ing 	 	a	certain	band	of	 wind 	 s 	 	that	could	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	push	them	 to 	 ward 	 	the	coast	of	south	america	.
but	they	 k 	 new 	 	that	the	 she 	 er 	 	length	of	 th 	 is 	 	journey	would	stretch	 the 	 ir 	 	 suppli 	 es 	 	of	food	and	water	.
to	be	eaten	by	 cannibal 	 s 	 	,	to	be	 batt 	 er 	 ed 	 	by	 storm 	 s 	 	,	to	 starv 	 e 	 	to	death	before	 reach 	 ing 	 	land	.
these	 we 	 re 	 	the	 fear 	 s 	 	that	 danc 	 ed 	 	in	the	 imagin 	 ations 	 	of	these	poor	men	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	,	the	fear	they	chose	to	listen	to	would	govern	 whet 	 her 	 	they	lived	or	 di 	 ed 	 	.
now	we	might	just	 a 	 s 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	call	these	 fear 	 s 	 	by	a	different	name	.
what	if	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 call 	 ing 	 	them	 fear 	 s 	 	,	we	 call 	 ed 	 	them	 st 	 ories 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	what	fear	is	,	if	you	think	about	it	.
it	's	a	kind	of	 un 	 intentional 	 	 story 	 tell 	 ing 	 	that	we	are	all	born	 know 	 ing 	 	how	to	do	.
and	 fear 	 s 	 	and	 story 	 tell 	 ing 	 	have	the	same	 component 	 s 	 	.
they	have	the	same	 architect 	 ure 	 	.
like	all	 st 	 ories 	 	,	 fear 	 s 	 	have	 character 	 s 	 	.
in	our	 fear 	 s 	 	,	the	 character 	 s 	 	are	us	.
 fear 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	have	 plot 	 s 	 	.	they	have	 begin 	 ning 	 s 	 	and	 middle 	 s 	 	and	 end 	 s 	 	.
you	board	the	plane	.	the	plane	 take 	 s 	 	off	.	the	engine	 fail 	 s 	 	.
our	 fear 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	tend	to	contain	 image 	 ry 	 	that	can	be	every	bit	 a 	 s 	 	 vivi 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	what	you	might	find	in	the	 page 	 s 	 	of	a	novel	.
picture	a	cannibal	,	human	 tee 	 th 	 	 sink 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	human	skin	,	human	 fl 	 esh 	 	 roast 	 ing 	 	over	a	fire	.
 fear 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	have	suspense	.
if	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	my	job	 a 	 s 	 	a	 story 	 teller 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	you	should	be	 wonder 	 ing 	 	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	the	men	of	the	 whale 	 ship 	 	essex	.
our	 fear 	 s 	 	 provok 	 e 	 	in	us	a	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	form	of	suspense	.
just	like	all	great	 st 	 ories 	 	,	our	 fear 	 s 	 	focus	our	attention	on	a	question	that	is	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	in	life	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	in	 liter 	 ature 	 	:	what	will	happen	next	?
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	our	 fear 	 s 	 	make	us	think	about	the	future	.
and	 human 	 s 	 	,	by	the	way	,	are	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 creature 	 s 	 	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	future	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	,	of	 project 	 ing 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	forward	in	time	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	mental	time	travel	is	just	one	more	thing	that	 fear 	 s 	 	have	in	common	with	 story 	 tell 	 ing 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	writer	,	i	can	tell	you	that	a	big	part	of	writing	fiction	is	 learn 	 ing 	 	to	predict	how	one	event	in	a	story	will	affect	all	the	other	 event 	 s 	 	,	and	fear	 work 	 s 	 	in	that	same	way	.
in	fear	,	just	like	in	fiction	,	one	thing	 al 	 ways 	 	 lead 	 s 	 	to	 an 	 other 	 	.
when	i	was	writing	my	first	novel	,	``	the	age	of	 miracle 	 s 	 	,	``	i	 s 	 pent 	 	 month 	 s 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	what	would	happen	if	the	 rot 	 ation 	 	of	the	earth	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	to	 s 	 low 	 	down	.
what	would	happen	to	our	 day 	 s 	 	?	what	would	happen	to	our	 crop 	 s 	 	?
what	would	happen	to	our	 mind 	 s 	 	?
and	then	it	was	 on 	 ly 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	that	i	 real 	 ized 	 	how	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	these	 question 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	to	the	 one 	 s 	 	i	used	to	ask	 my 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	child	 frighten 	 ed 	 	in	the	night	.
if	an	 earth 	 quake 	 	 strike 	 s 	 	 to 	 night 	 	,	i	used	to	worry	,	what	will	happen	to	our	house	?	what	will	happen	to	my	family	?	and	the	answer	to	 t 	 hose 	 	 question 	 s 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	took	the	form	of	a	story	.
so	if	we	think	of	our	 fear 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	more	than	just	 fear 	 s 	 	but	 a 	 s 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	,	we	should	think	of	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 author 	 s 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	.
but	just	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	we	need	to	think	of	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 read 	 ers 	 	of	our	 fear 	 s 	 	,	and	how	we	 choos 	 e 	 	to	read	our	 fear 	 s 	 	can	have	a	 pro 	 found 	 	effect	on	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
now	,	some	of	us	 natural 	 ly 	 	read	our	 fear 	 s 	 	more	 close 	 ly 	 	than	 other 	 s 	 	.
i	read	about	a	 stud 	 y 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	of	 success 	 ful 	 	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	,	and	the	author	found	that	these	people	 share 	 d 	 	a	habit	that	he	 call 	 ed 	 	``	productive	 para 	 no 	 ia 	 	,	``	which	 me 	 ant 	 	that	these	people	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 dismiss 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 fear 	 s 	 	,	these	people	read	them	 close 	 ly 	 	,	they	 stud 	 ied 	 	them	,	and	then	they	 transl 	 ated 	 	that	fear	 in 	 to 	 	 pre 	 par 	 ation 	 	and	action	.
so	that	way	,	if	 the 	 ir 	 	worst	 fear 	 s 	 	came	true	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 business 	 es 	 	 we 	 re 	 	ready	.
and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	of	course	,	our	worst	 fear 	 s 	 	do	come	true	.
that	's	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	is	so	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	about	fear	.
once	in	a	while	,	our	 fear 	 s 	 	can	predict	the	future	.
but	we	ca	n't	possibly	 prep 	 are 	 	for	all	of	the	 fear 	 s 	 	that	our	 imagin 	 ations 	 	concoct	.
so	how	can	we	tell	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	the	 fear 	 s 	 	worth	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	and	all	the	 other 	 s 	 	?
i	think	the	end	of	the	story	of	the	 whale 	 ship 	 	essex	 off 	 ers 	 	an	 illumi 	 nating 	 	,	if	tragic	,	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
after	much	 de 	 liber 	 ation 	 	,	the	men	 final 	 ly 	 	made	a	decision	.
 terr 	 ified 	 	of	 cannibal 	 s 	 	,	they	 decide 	 d 	 	to	 for 	 go 	 	the	 close 	 st 	 	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	and	 in 	 stead 	 	 embark 	 ed 	 	on	the	 long 	 er 	 	and	much	more	difficult	route	to	south	america	.
after	more	than	two	 month 	 s 	 	at	sea	,	the	men	ran	out	of	food	 a 	 s 	 	they	 k 	 new 	 	they	might	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	still	 quit 	 e 	 	far	from	land	.
when	the	last	of	the	 surviv 	 ors 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 final 	 ly 	 	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	by	two	 pass 	 ing 	 	 ship 	 s 	 	,	less	than	half	of	the	men	 we 	 re 	 	left	 al 	 ive 	 	,
and	some	of	them	had	 resort 	 ed 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	own	form	of	 cannibal 	 ism 	 	.
herman	melville	,	who	used	 th 	 is 	 	story	 a 	 s 	 	research	for	``	moby	 d 	 ick 	 	,	``	wrote	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	and	from	dry	land	,	quote	,	``	all	the	 suffer 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	these	 mis 	 er 	 able 	 	men	of	the	essex	might	in	all	human	 prob 	 ability 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 avoid 	 ed 	 	had	they	,	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	after	 leav 	 ing 	 	the	wreck	,	 steer 	 ed 	 	straight	for	tahiti	.	but	,	``	 a 	 s 	 	melville	put	it	,	``	they	 dread 	 ed 	 	 cannibal 	 s 	 	.	``	so	the	question	is	,	why	did	these	men	dread	 cannibal 	 s 	 	so	much	more	than	the	 extrem 	 e 	 	 like 	 li 	 hood 	 	of	 starv 	 ation 	 	?
why	 we 	 re 	 	they	 s 	 way 	 ed 	 	by	one	story	so	much	more	than	the	other	?
 look 	 ed 	 	at	from	 th 	 is 	 	angle	,	 the 	 ir 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	story	about	 read 	 ing 	 	.
the	 novel 	 ist 	 	vladimir	nabokov	 s 	 aid 	 	that	the	best	 read 	 er 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	combination	of	two	 ver 	 y 	 	different	 temperament 	 s 	 	,	the	 art 	 istic 	 	and	the	scientific	.
a	good	 read 	 er 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	an	artist	's	 pass 	 ion 	 	,	a	 will 	 ing 	 ness 	 	to	get	caught	up	in	the	story	,	but	just	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	the	 read 	 ers 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 need 	 s 	 	the	 cool 	 ness 	 	of	judgment	of	a	scientist	,	which	 act 	 s 	 	to	temper	and	 complic 	 ate 	 	the	 read 	 er 	 	's	intuitive	 react 	 ions 	 	to	the	story	.
 a 	 s 	 	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	,	the	men	of	the	essex	had	no	trouble	with	the	 art 	 istic 	 	part	.
they	 dream 	 ed 	 	up	a	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 horr 	 ifying 	 	 scenario 	 s 	 	.
the	problem	was	that	they	 listen 	 ed 	 	to	the	wrong	story	.
of	all	the	 narrative 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 fear 	 s 	 	wrote	,	they	 respond 	 ed 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	to	the	most	 lu 	 rid 	 	,	the	most	 vivi 	 d 	 	,	the	one	that	was	 eas 	 iest 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 imagin 	 ations 	 	to	picture	:	 cannibal 	 s 	 	.
but	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	if	they	'd	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	read	 the 	 ir 	 	 fear 	 s 	 	more	like	a	scientist	,	with	more	 cool 	 ness 	 	of	judgment	,	they	would	have	 listen 	 ed 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	to	the	less	violent	but	the	more	 like 	 ly 	 	tale	,	the	story	of	 starv 	 ation 	 	,	and	headed	for	tahiti	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	melville	's	 s 	 ad 	 	 comment 	 ary 	 	 suggest 	 s 	 	.
and	 may 	 be 	 	if	we	all	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	read	our	 fear 	 s 	 	,	we	too	would	be	less	often	 s 	 way 	 ed 	 	by	the	most	 s 	 al 	 acious 	 	among	them	.
 may 	 be 	 	then	we	'd	 s 	 pend 	 	less	time	 worry 	 ing 	 	about	 s 	 erial 	 	 killer 	 s 	 	and	plane	 crash 	 es 	 	,	and	more	time	 concern 	 ed 	 	with	the	 subtle 	 r 	 	and	 s 	 lower 	 	 disaster 	 s 	 	we	face	:	the	silent	 build 	 up 	 	of	 pla 	 que 	 	in	our	 arteri 	 es 	 	,	the	 gradu 	 al 	 	 change 	 s 	 	in	our	climate	.
