so	,	why	 do 	 es 	 	good	 s 	 ex 	 	so	often	 fad 	 e 	 	,	even	for	 couple 	 s 	 	who	 continu 	 e 	 	to	love	each	other	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	ever	?
and	why	 do 	 es 	 	good	 in 	 timacy 	 	not	guarantee	good	 s 	 ex 	 	,	 contr 	 ary 	 	to	popular	belief	?
or	,	the	next	question	would	be	,	can	we	want	what	we	 al 	 ready 	 	have	?
that	's	the	million	-	dollar	question	,	right	?
and	why	is	the	 forbid 	 den 	 	so	 er 	 otic 	 	?
what	is	it	about	transgression	that	 make 	 s 	 	 desir 	 e 	 	so	potent	?
and	why	 do 	 es 	 	 s 	 ex 	 	make	 bab 	 ies 	 	,	and	 bab 	 ies 	 	spell	 er 	 otic 	 	disaster	in	 couple 	 s 	 	?
it	's	kind	of	the	fatal	 er 	 otic 	 	blow	,	is	n't	it	?
and	when	you	love	,	how	 do 	 es 	 	it	feel	?
and	when	you	 desir 	 e 	 	,	how	is	it	different	?
these	are	some	of	the	 question 	 s 	 	that	are	at	the	center	of	my	exploration	on	the	nature	of	 er 	 otic 	 	 desir 	 e 	 	and	 it 	 s 	 	concomitant	 dilemma 	 s 	 	in	modern	love	.
so	i	travel	the	 glob 	 e 	 	,	and	what	i	'm	 not 	 ic 	 ing 	 	is	that	 every 	 where 	 	where	 romantic 	 ism 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 enter 	 ed 	 	,	there	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	a	crisis	of	 desir 	 e 	 	.
a	crisis	of	 desir 	 e 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	in	 own 	 ing 	 	the	 want 	 ing 	 	--	 desir 	 e 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	 express 	 ion 	 	of	our	 individual 	 ity 	 	,	of	our	free	choice	,	of	our	 pre 	 ference 	 s 	 	,	of	our	 ident 	 ity 	 	--	 desir 	 e 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	a	central	 con 	 cept 	 	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	modern	love	and	 individual 	 istic 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	.
you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	time	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 human 	 kind 	 	where	we	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	experience	 sexual 	 ity 	 	in	the	long	term	,	not	 be 	 cause 	 	we	want	14	children	,	for	which	we	need	to	have	even	more	 be 	 cause 	 	 man 	 y 	 	of	them	wo	n't	make	it	,	and	not	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	 exclusive 	 ly 	 	a	woman	's	marital	duty	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	time	that	we	want	 s 	 ex 	 	over	time	about	pleasure	and	 connect 	 ion 	 	that	is	 root 	 ed 	 	in	 desir 	 e 	 	.
so	what	sustains	 desir 	 e 	 	,	and	why	is	it	so	difficult	?
and	at	the	heart	of	 sustain 	 ing 	 	 desir 	 e 	 	in	a	 commit 	 ted 	 	relationship	,	i	think	is	the	 reconcili 	 ation 	 	of	two	fundamental	human	 need 	 s 	 	.
on	the	one	hand	,	our	need	for	security	,	for	 predict 	 ability 	 	,	for	 safe 	 ty 	 	,	for	dependability	,	for	 reli 	 ability 	 	,	for	permanence	--	all	these	 anchor 	 ing 	 	,	 ground 	 ing 	 	 experience 	 s 	 	of	our	 live 	 s 	 	that	we	call	home	.
but	we	 al 	 so 	 	have	an	 equal 	 ly 	 	strong	need	--	men	and	women	--	for	adventure	,	for	 novel 	 ty 	 	,	for	 myster 	 y 	 	,	for	risk	,	for	danger	,	for	the	 un 	 known 	 	,	for	the	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	,	surprise	--	you	get	the	 g 	 ist 	 	--	for	journey	,	for	travel	.
so	 reconcili 	 ng 	 	our	need	for	security	and	our	need	for	adventure	 in 	 to 	 	one	relationship	,	or	what	we	 to 	 day 	 	like	to	call	a	passionate	marriage	,	used	to	be	a	 contradict 	 ion 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	.
marriage	was	an	economic	institution	in	which	you	 we 	 re 	 	 give 	 n 	 	a	 partner 	 ship 	 	for	life	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	children	and	social	 stat 	 us 	 	and	 success 	 ion 	 	and	 companion 	 ship 	 	.
but	now	we	want	our	partner	to	still	give	us	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	but	in	 add 	 ition 	 	i	want	you	to	be	my	best	friend	and	my	 trust 	 ed 	 	confidant	and	my	passionate	lover	to	boot	,	and	we	live	twice	 a 	 s 	 	long	.
so	we	come	to	one	person	,	and	we	 bas 	 ically 	 	are	 ask 	 ing 	 	them	to	give	us	what	once	an	entire	village	used	to	provide	:	give	me	 belong 	 ing 	 	,	give	me	 ident 	 ity 	 	,	give	me	 continu 	 ity 	 	,	but	give	me	 transcend 	 ence 	 	and	 myster 	 y 	 	and	awe	all	in	one	.
give	me	comfort	,	give	me	edge	.
give	me	 novel 	 ty 	 	,	give	me	 familiar 	 ity 	 	.
give	me	 predict 	 ability 	 	,	give	me	surprise	.
and	we	think	it	's	a	 give 	 n 	 	,	and	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	and	 linger 	 ie 	 	are	going	to	 s 	 ave 	 	us	with	that	.
so	now	we	get	to	the	existential	 re 	 ality 	 	of	the	story	,	right	?
 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	,	in	some	way	--	and	i	'll	come	back	to	that	--	but	the	crisis	of	 desir 	 e 	 	is	often	a	crisis	of	the	 imagin 	 ation 	 	.
so	why	 do 	 es 	 	good	 s 	 ex 	 	so	often	 fad 	 e 	 	?
what	is	the	relationship	between	love	and	 desir 	 e 	 	?
how	do	they	 re 	 late 	 	,	and	how	do	they	conflict	?
 be 	 cause 	 	 there 	 in 	 	lies	the	 myster 	 y 	 	of	 er 	 otic 	 ism 	 	.
so	if	there	is	a	verb	,	for	me	,	that	 come 	 s 	 	with	love	,	it	's	``	to	have	.	``
and	if	there	is	a	verb	that	 come 	 s 	 	with	 desir 	 e 	 	,	it	is	``	to	want	.	``
in	love	,	we	want	to	have	,	we	want	to	know	the	 be 	 love 	 d 	 	.
we	want	to	 minim 	 ize 	 	the	distance	.	we	want	to	contract	that	gap	.
we	want	to	 neutral 	 ize 	 	the	 tension 	 s 	 	.	we	want	 close 	 ness 	 	.
but	in	 desir 	 e 	 	,	we	tend	to	not	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	go	back	to	the	 place 	 s 	 	we	've	 al 	 ready 	 	gone	.
 for 	 gone 	 	 con 	 clusion 	 	 do 	 es 	 	not	keep	our	interest	.
in	 desir 	 e 	 	,	we	want	an	other	,	 some 	 body 	 	on	the	other	side	that	we	can	go	visit	,	that	we	can	go	 s 	 pend 	 	some	time	with	,	that	we	can	go	see	what	 go 	 es 	 	on	in	 the 	 ir 	 	red	light	 di 	 strict 	 	.
in	 desir 	 e 	 	,	we	want	a	bridge	to	cross	.
or	in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	i	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	say	,	fire	 need 	 s 	 	air	.
 desir 	 e 	 	 need 	 s 	 	space	.
and	when	it	's	 s 	 aid 	 	like	that	,	it	's	often	 quit 	 e 	 	abstract	.
but	then	i	took	a	question	with	me	.
and	i	've	gone	to	more	than	20	 count 	 ries 	 	in	the	last	few	 year 	 s 	 	with	``	 mat 	 ing 	 	in	 captiv 	 ity 	 	,	``	and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	people	,	when	do	you	find	 your 	 self 	 	most	drawn	to	your	partner	?
not	 attract 	 ed 	 	 sexual 	 ly 	 	,	per	 s 	 e 	 	,	but	most	drawn	.
and	 a 	 cross 	 	culture	,	 a 	 cross 	 	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	and	 a 	 cross 	 	gender	--	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	one	--	there	are	a	few	 answer 	 s 	 	that	just	keep	coming	back	.
so	the	first	group	is	:	i	am	most	drawn	to	my	partner	when	she	is	away	,	when	we	are	 a 	 part 	 	,	when	we	reunite	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	,	when	i	get	back	in	touch	with	my	ability	to	imagine	 my 	 self 	 	with	my	partner	,	when	my	 imagin 	 ation 	 	 come 	 s 	 	back	in	the	picture	,	and	when	i	can	root	it	in	 ab 	 s 	 ence 	 	and	in	 long 	 ing 	 	,	which	is	a	major	component	of	 desir 	 e 	 	.
but	then	the	second	group	is	even	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	:	i	am	most	drawn	to	my	partner	when	i	see	him	in	the	studio	,	when	she	is	 on 	 stage 	 	,	when	he	is	in	his	element	,	when	she	's	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	she	's	passionate	about	,	when	i	see	him	at	a	party	and	other	people	are	 re 	 ally 	 	drawn	to	him	,	when	i	see	her	hold	court	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	,	when	i	look	at	my	partner	 radi 	 ant 	 	and	confident	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	 big 	 gest 	 	turn	-	on	 a 	 cross 	 	the	board	.
 radi 	 ant 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	in	self	-	 sustain 	 ing 	 	.
i	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	person	--	by	the	way	,	in	 desir 	 e 	 	people	 rare 	 ly 	 	talk	about	it	,	when	we	are	 blend 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	one	,	five	 centimeter 	 s 	 	from	each	other	.	i	do	n't	know	in	 inch 	 es 	 	how	much	that	is	.
but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	not	when	the	other	person	is	that	far	 a 	 part 	 	that	you	no	 long 	 er 	 	see	them	.
it	's	when	i	'm	looking	at	my	partner	from	a	 comfort 	 able 	 	distance	,	where	 th 	 is 	 	person	that	is	 al 	 ready 	 	so	familiar	,	so	known	,	is	 moment 	 arily 	 	once	 aga 	 in 	 	 some 	 what 	 	 myster 	 ious 	 	,	 some 	 what 	 	elusive	.
and	in	 th 	 is 	 	space	between	me	and	the	other	lies	the	 er 	 otic 	 	Ã©lan	,	lies	that	 move 	 ment 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	the	other	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	proust	 say 	 s 	 	,	 myster 	 y 	 	is	not	about	 travel 	 ing 	 	to	new	 place 	 s 	 	,	but	it	's	about	looking	with	new	 eye 	 s 	 	.
and	so	,	when	i	see	my	partner	on	his	own	or	her	own	,	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	in	which	they	are	 envelop 	 ed 	 	,	i	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	person	and	i	 moment 	 arily 	 	get	a	shift	in	 per 	 ception 	 	,	and	i	stay	open	to	the	 myster 	 ies 	 	that	are	living	right	next	to	me	.
and	then	,	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	about	the	other	or	 my 	 self 	 	--	it	's	the	same	--	what	is	most	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	that	there	is	no	neediness	in	 desir 	 e 	 	.
 no 	 body 	 	 need 	 s 	 	 any 	 body 	 	.
there	is	no	caretaking	in	 desir 	 e 	 	.
caretaking	is	 might 	 ily 	 	loving	.	it	's	a	 power 	 ful 	 	anti	-	aphrodisiac	.
i	have	yet	to	see	 some 	 body 	 	who	is	so	 turn 	 ed 	 	on	by	 some 	 body 	 	who	 need 	 s 	 	them	.
 want 	 ing 	 	them	is	one	thing	.	 need 	 ing 	 	them	is	a	shutdown	,	and	women	have	known	that	 fore 	 ver 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	that	will	 br 	 ing 	 	up	 parent 	 hood 	 	will	 usual 	 ly 	 	 de 	 crease 	 	the	 er 	 otic 	 	charge	.
for	good	 reason 	 s 	 	,	right	?
and	then	the	third	group	of	 answer 	 s 	 	 usual 	 ly 	 	would	be	when	i	'm	 surprise 	 d 	 	,	when	we	laugh	together	,	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 body 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	in	the	 off 	 ice 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	when	he	's	in	his	tux	,	so	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	you	know	,	it	's	either	the	tux	or	the	 cow 	 boy 	 	 boot 	 s 	 	.
but	 bas 	 ically 	 	it	's	when	there	is	 novel 	 ty 	 	.
but	 novel 	 ty 	 	is	n't	about	new	 position 	 s 	 	.	it	is	n't	a	repertoire	of	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	.
 novel 	 ty 	 	is	,	what	 part 	 s 	 	of	you	do	you	 br 	 ing 	 	out	?
what	 part 	 s 	 	of	you	are	just	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 een 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	in	some	way	one	could	say	 s 	 ex 	 	is	n't	 some 	 thing 	 	you	do	,	eh	?
 s 	 ex 	 	is	a	place	you	go	.	it	's	a	space	you	enter	 in 	 side 	 	 your 	 self 	 	and	with	 an 	 other 	 	,	or	 other 	 s 	 	.
so	where	do	you	go	in	 s 	 ex 	 	?
what	 part 	 s 	 	of	you	do	you	connect	to	?
what	do	you	seek	to	express	there	?
is	it	a	place	for	 transcend 	 ence 	 	and	spiritual	 un 	 ion 	 	?
is	it	a	place	for	naughtiness	and	is	it	a	place	to	be	 safe 	 ly 	 	 aggress 	 ive 	 	?
is	it	a	place	where	you	can	 final 	 ly 	 	surrender	and	not	have	to	take	 respons 	 ibility 	 	for	 every 	 thing 	 	?
is	it	a	place	where	you	can	express	your	 infant 	 ile 	 	 wish 	 es 	 	?
what	 come 	 s 	 	out	there	?	it	's	a	language	.
it	is	n't	just	a	behavior	.
and	it	's	the	 poet 	 ic 	 	of	that	language	that	i	'm	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	,	which	is	why	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	explore	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 cept 	 	of	 er 	 otic 	 	 intellig 	 ence 	 	.
you	know	,	 animal 	 s 	 	have	 s 	 ex 	 	.
it	's	the	pivot	,	it	's	biology	,	it	's	the	natural	instinct	.
we	are	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 one 	 s 	 	who	have	an	 er 	 otic 	 	life	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	that	it	's	 sexual 	 ity 	 	 transform 	 ed 	 	by	the	human	 imagin 	 ation 	 	.
we	are	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 one 	 s 	 	who	can	make	love	for	 hour 	 s 	 	,	have	a	 bli 	 s 	 s 	 ful 	 	time	,	 multi 	 ple 	 	 orgasm 	 s 	 	,	and	touch	 no 	 body 	 	,	just	 be 	 cause 	 	we	can	imagine	it	.
we	can	hint	at	it	.	we	do	n't	even	have	to	do	it	.
we	can	experience	that	 power 	 ful 	 	thing	 call 	 ed 	 	 anticip 	 ation 	 	,	which	is	a	 mort 	 ar 	 	to	 desir 	 e 	 	,	the	ability	to	imagine	it	,	 a 	 s 	 	if	it	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	,	to	experience	it	 a 	 s 	 	if	it	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	,	while	 noth 	 ing 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	and	 every 	 thing 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	at	the	same	time	.
so	when	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	think	about	 er 	 otic 	 ism 	 	,	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	think	about	the	 poet 	 ic 	 s 	 	of	 s 	 ex 	 	,	and	if	i	look	at	it	 a 	 s 	 	an	 intellig 	 ence 	 	,	then	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	you	 cultiv 	 ate 	 	.
what	are	the	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	?	 imagin 	 ation 	 	,	 play 	 fulness 	 	,	 novel 	 ty 	 	,	curiosity	,	 myster 	 y 	 	.
but	the	central	agent	is	 re 	 ally 	 	that	piece	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 imagin 	 ation 	 	.
but	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	for	me	to	begin	to	understand	who	are	the	 couple 	 s 	 	who	have	an	 er 	 otic 	 	spark	,	what	sustains	 desir 	 e 	 	,	i	had	to	go	back	to	the	original	definition	of	 er 	 otic 	 ism 	 	,	the	 mystic 	 al 	 	definition	,	and	i	went	through	it	through	a	 bifurc 	 ation 	 	by	looking	 actual 	 ly 	 	at	trauma	,	which	is	the	other	side	,	and	i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	it	looking	at	the	community	that	i	had	grown	up	in	,	which	was	a	community	in	belgium	,	all	 holo 	 caus 	 t 	 	 surviv 	 ors 	 	,	and	in	my	community	there	 we 	 re 	 	two	 group 	 s 	 	:	 t 	 hose 	 	who	did	n't	die	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	who	came	back	to	life	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	who	did	n't	die	lived	often	 ver 	 y 	 	 tether 	 ed 	 	to	the	ground	,	could	not	experience	pleasure	,	could	not	trust	,	 be 	 cause 	 	when	you	're	 vigil 	 ant 	 	,	 worri 	 ed 	 	,	 anx 	 ious 	 	,	and	 in 	 secure 	 	,	you	ca	n't	lift	your	head	to	go	and	take	off	in	space	and	be	 play 	 ful 	 	and	safe	and	 imagin 	 ative 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	who	came	back	to	life	 we 	 re 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	who	 under 	 stood 	 	the	 er 	 otic 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	antidote	to	death	.
they	 k 	 new 	 	how	to	keep	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 al 	 ive 	 	.
and	when	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	listen	to	the	sexlessness	of	the	 couple 	 s 	 	that	i	work	with	,	i	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	would	hear	people	say	,	``	i	want	more	 s 	 ex 	 	,	``	but	 general 	 ly 	 	people	want	better	 s 	 ex 	 	,	and	better	is	to	 re 	 connect 	 	with	that	quality	of	aliveness	,	of	 vib 	 r 	 ancy 	 	,	of	 renew 	 al 	 	,	of	 vital 	 ity 	 	,	of	 ero 	 s 	 	,	of	energy	that	 s 	 ex 	 	used	to	afford	them	,	or	that	they	've	 hop 	 ed 	 	it	would	afford	them	.
and	so	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	ask	a	different	question	.
``	i	shut	 my 	 self 	 	off	when	.	.	.	``	 beg 	 an 	 	to	be	the	question	.
``	i	turn	off	my	 desir 	 es 	 	when	.	.	.	``	which	is	not	the	same	question	 a 	 s 	 	,	``	what	 turn 	 s 	 	me	of	is	.	.	.	``	and	``	you	turn	me	off	when	.	.	.	``	and	people	 beg 	 an 	 	to	say	,	``	i	turn	 my 	 self 	 	off	when	i	feel	dead	 in 	 side 	 	,	when	i	do	n't	like	my	body	,	when	i	feel	old	,	when	i	have	n't	had	time	for	 my 	 self 	 	,	when	i	have	n't	had	a	chance	to	even	check	in	with	you	,	when	i	do	n't	perform	well	at	work	,	when	i	feel	low	self	esteem	,	when	i	do	n't	have	a	sense	of	self	-	worth	,	when	i	do	n't	feel	like	i	have	a	right	to	want	,	to	take	,	to	 receiv 	 e 	 	pleasure	.	``	and	then	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	ask	the	reverse	question	.
``	i	turn	 my 	 self 	 	on	when	.	.	.	``	 be 	 cause 	 	most	of	the	time	,	people	like	to	ask	the	question	,	``	you	turn	me	on	,	what	 turn 	 s 	 	me	on	,	``	and	i	'm	out	of	the	question	.	you	know	?
now	,	if	you	are	dead	 in 	 side 	 	,	the	other	person	can	do	a	lot	of	 thing 	 s 	 	for	 valent 	 ine 	 	's	.
it	wo	n't	make	a	dent	.	there	is	 no 	 body 	 	at	the	 re 	 ception 	 	desk	.
so	i	turn	 my 	 self 	 	on	when	,	i	turn	my	 desir 	 es 	 	,	i	wake	up	when	...
now	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	paradox	between	love	and	 desir 	 e 	 	,	what	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	so	 puzzl 	 ing 	 	is	that	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	that	nurture	love	--	mutuality	,	 reciproc 	 ity 	 	,	 protect 	 ion 	 	,	worry	,	 respons 	 ibility 	 	for	the	other	--	are	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	that	stifle	 desir 	 e 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 desir 	 e 	 	 come 	 s 	 	with	a	host	of	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	that	are	not	 al 	 ways 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 favor 	 ites 	 	of	love	:	 jealous 	 y 	 	,	possessiveness	,	 aggress 	 ion 	 	,	power	,	 domin 	 ance 	 	,	naughtiness	,	mischief	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	most	of	us	will	get	 turn 	 ed 	 	on	at	night	by	the	 ver 	 y 	 	same	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	will	 demonst 	 rate 	 	against	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	day	.
you	know	,	the	 er 	 otic 	 	mind	is	not	 ver 	 y 	 	 politic 	 ally 	 	correct	.
if	 every 	 body 	 	was	fantasizing	on	a	bed	of	 rose 	 s 	 	,	we	would	n't	be	 hav 	 ing 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 talk 	 s 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	no	,	in	our	mind	up	there	are	a	host	of	 thing 	 s 	 	going	on	that	we	do	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	know	how	to	 br 	 ing 	 	to	the	person	that	we	love	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	think	love	 come 	 s 	 	with	selflessness	and	in	fact	 desir 	 e 	 	 come 	 s 	 	with	a	certain	amount	of	 self 	 ish 	 ness 	 	in	the	best	sense	of	the	word	:	the	ability	to	stay	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	one	's	self	in	the	presence	of	 an 	 other 	 	.
so	i	want	to	draw	that	little	image	for	you	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	need	to	reconcile	these	two	 set 	 s 	 	of	 need 	 s 	 	,	we	are	born	with	that	.	our	need	for	 connect 	 ion 	 	,	our	need	for	 separat 	 e 	 ness 	 	,	or	our	need	for	security	and	adventure	,	or	our	need	for	togetherness	and	for	 auto 	 nomy 	 	,	and	if	you	think	about	the	little	kid	who	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	on	your	lap	and	who	is	 co 	 zi 	 ly 	 	 nest 	 ed 	 	here	and	 ver 	 y 	 	secure	and	 comfort 	 able 	 	,	and	at	some	point	all	of	us	need	to	go	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	world	to	discover	and	to	explore	.
that	's	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	 desir 	 e 	 	,	that	 expl 	 or 	 atory 	 	 need 	 s 	 	curiosity	,	 discover 	 y 	 	.
and	then	at	some	point	they	turn	around	and	they	look	at	you	,	and	if	you	tell	them	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	kiddo	,	the	world	's	a	great	place	.	go	for	it	.
there	's	so	much	 f 	 un 	 	out	there	,	``	then	they	can	turn	away	and	they	can	experience	 connect 	 ion 	 	and	 separat 	 e 	 ness 	 	at	the	same	time	.
they	can	go	off	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 imagin 	 ation 	 	,	off	in	 the 	 ir 	 	body	,	off	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 play 	 fulness 	 	,	all	the	while	 know 	 ing 	 	that	there	's	 some 	 body 	 	when	they	come	back	.
but	if	on	 th 	 is 	 	side	there	is	 some 	 body 	 	who	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	'm	 worri 	 ed 	 	.	i	'm	 anx 	 ious 	 	.	i	'm	 depress 	 ed 	 	.
my	partner	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	taken	care	of	me	in	so	long	.
what	's	so	good	out	there	?	do	n't	we	have	 every 	 thing 	 	you	need	together	,	you	and	i	?	``	then	there	are	a	few	little	 react 	 ions 	 	that	all	of	us	can	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 recogn 	 ize 	 	.
some	of	us	will	come	back	,	came	back	a	long	time	ago	,	and	that	little	child	who	 come 	 s 	 	back	is	the	child	who	will	 for 	 go 	 	a	part	of	 him 	 self 	 	in	order	not	to	lose	the	other	.
i	will	lose	my	 free 	 dom 	 	in	order	not	to	lose	 connect 	 ion 	 	.
and	i	will	learn	to	love	in	a	certain	way	that	will	 be 	 come 	 	burdened	with	extra	worry	and	extra	 respons 	 ibility 	 	and	extra	 protect 	 ion 	 	,	and	i	wo	n't	know	how	to	 leav 	 e 	 	you	in	order	to	go	play	,	in	order	to	go	experience	pleasure	,	in	order	to	discover	,	to	enter	 in 	 side 	 	 my 	 self 	 	.
 transl 	 ate 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 to 	 	adult	language	.
it	 start 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	young	.	it	 continu 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	our	 s 	 ex 	 	 live 	 s 	 	up	to	the	end	.
child	number	two	 come 	 s 	 	back	but	 look 	 s 	 	like	that	over	 the 	 ir 	 	shoulder	all	the	time	.
``	are	you	going	to	be	there	?
are	you	going	to	curse	me	?	are	you	going	to	 s 	 cold 	 	me	?
are	you	going	to	be	 ang 	 ry 	 	with	me	?	``	and	they	may	be	gone	,	but	they	're	never	 re 	 ally 	 	away	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	are	often	the	people	that	will	tell	you	,	in	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	it	was	super	hot	.
 be 	 cause 	 	in	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	the	growing	 in 	 timacy 	 	was	n't	yet	so	strong	that	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	led	to	the	 de 	 crease 	 	of	 desir 	 e 	 	.
the	more	 connect 	 ed 	 	i	 be 	 came 	 	,	the	more	 respons 	 ible 	 	i	felt	,	the	less	i	was	able	to	let	go	in	your	presence	.
the	third	child	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	come	back	.
so	what	 happen 	 s 	 	,	if	you	want	to	sustain	 desir 	 e 	 	,	it	's	that	real	 dialect 	 ic 	 	piece	.
on	the	one	hand	you	want	the	security	in	order	to	be	able	to	go	.
on	the	other	hand	if	you	ca	n't	go	,	you	ca	n't	have	pleasure	,	you	ca	n't	 culmin 	 ate 	 	,	you	do	n't	have	an	orgasm	,	you	do	n't	get	 excit 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	you	 s 	 pend 	 	your	time	in	the	body	and	the	head	of	the	other	and	not	in	your	own	.
so	in	 th 	 is 	 	dilemma	about	 reconcili 	 ng 	 	these	two	 set 	 s 	 	of	fundamental	 need 	 s 	 	,	there	are	a	few	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	've	come	to	understand	 er 	 otic 	 	 couple 	 s 	 	do	.
one	,	they	have	a	lot	of	sexual	 pri 	 vac 	 y 	 	.
they	understand	that	there	is	an	 er 	 otic 	 	space	that	 belong 	 s 	 	to	each	of	them	.
they	 al 	 so 	 	understand	that	 fore 	 play 	 	is	not	 some 	 thing 	 	you	do	five	 minute 	 s 	 	before	the	real	thing	.
 fore 	 play 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 start 	 s 	 	at	the	end	of	the	previous	orgasm	.
they	 al 	 so 	 	understand	that	an	 er 	 otic 	 	space	is	n't	about	,	you	begin	to	stroke	the	other	.
it	's	about	you	create	a	space	where	you	 leav 	 e 	 	management	inc.	,	 may 	 be 	 	where	you	 leav 	 e 	 	the	 ag 	 ile 	 	program	,	and	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	just	enter	that	place	where	you	stop	 be 	 ing 	 	the	good	citizen	who	is	taking	care	of	 thing 	 s 	 	and	 be 	 ing 	 	 respons 	 ible 	 	.
 respons 	 ibility 	 	and	 desir 	 e 	 	just	butt	 head 	 s 	 	.
they	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	do	well	together	.
 er 	 otic 	 	 couple 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	understand	that	 pass 	 ion 	 	 wax 	 es 	 	and	wanes	.
it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	like	the	moon	.	it	 ha 	 s 	 	intermittent	eclipses	.
but	what	they	know	is	they	know	how	to	resurrect	it	.
they	know	how	to	 br 	 ing 	 	it	back	,	and	they	know	how	to	 br 	 ing 	 	it	back	 be 	 cause 	 	they	have	 de 	 myst 	 ified 	 	one	big	myth	,	which	is	the	myth	of	 spontane 	 ity 	 	,	which	is	that	it	's	just	going	to	fall	from	heaven	while	you	're	 fold 	 ing 	 	the	 laundr 	 y 	 	like	a	deus	ex	machina	,	and	in	fact	they	 under 	 stood 	 	that	 what 	 ever 	 	is	going	to	just	happen	in	a	long	-	term	relationship	 al 	 ready 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	.
 commit 	 ted 	 	 s 	 ex 	 	is	 pre 	 meditate 	 d 	 	 s 	 ex 	 	.
it	's	 will 	 ful 	 	.	it	's	intentional	.
it	's	focus	and	presence	.
