 th 	 is 	 	is	about	a	 hid 	 den 	 	corner	of	the	labor	market	.
it	's	the	world	of	people	who	need	to	work	ultra	-	flexibly	,	if	they	're	to	work	at	all	.
so	think	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	of	 some 	 one 	 	who	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 recur 	 ring 	 	but	 un 	 predict 	 able 	 	medical	condition	,	or	 some 	 body 	 	who	's	 car 	 ing 	 	for	a	dependent	adult	,	or	a	parent	with	complex	child	care	 need 	 s 	 	.
 the 	 ir 	 	 avail 	 ability 	 	for	work	can	be	 s 	 uch 	 	that	it	's	,	``	a	few	 hour 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	i	can	work	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	,	but	i	do	n't	know	if	and	when	yet	.	``	and	it	's	 extra 	 ordinari 	 ly 	 	difficult	for	these	people	to	find	the	work	that	they	so	often	need	 ver 	 y 	 	 bad 	 ly 	 	.
which	is	a	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	there	are	 employ 	 ers 	 	who	can	use	 pool 	 s 	 	of	 ver 	 y 	 	 flex 	 ible 	 	local	people	 book 	 ed 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	ad	hoc	around	when	that	person	 want 	 s 	 	to	work	.
imagine	that	you	run	a	cafe	.
it	's	mid	-	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	the	place	is	 fill 	 ing 	 	up	.
you	're	going	to	have	a	 bus 	 y 	 	 lunch 	 time 	 	rush	.
if	you	could	get	two	extra	 work 	 ers 	 	for	90	 minute 	 s 	 	to	start	in	an	hour	's	time	,	you	'd	do	it	,	but	they	'd	have	to	be	 reli 	 able 	 	,	 in 	 duct 	 ed 	 	in	how	your	cafe	 work 	 s 	 	.
they	'd	have	to	be	 avail 	 able 	 	at	 ver 	 y 	 	competitive	rates	.

in	 re 	 ality 	 	,	no	 recruit 	 ment 	 	 age 	 ncy 	 	 want 	 s 	 	to	handle	that	sort	of	business	,	so	you	are	going	to	muddle	by	,	understaffed	.
and	it	's	not	just	caterers	,	it	's	hoteliers	,	it	's	 re 	 tail 	 ers 	 	,	it	's	 any 	 one 	 	who	 provide 	 s 	 	 service 	 s 	 	to	the	public	or	 business 	 es 	 	.

they	do	exist	.	here	's	how	they	work	.
so	in	 th 	 is 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	a	 distribut 	 ion 	 	company	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	we	've	got	a	rush	order	that	we	've	got	to	get	out	of	the	 ware 	 house 	 	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	.

and	they	'll	then	decide	when	to	do	 the 	 ir 	 	street	 interview 	 s 	 	.
but	is	there	more	that	could	be	 d 	 one 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	corner	of	the	labor	market	?
 be 	 cause 	 	right	now	there	are	so	 man 	 y 	 	people	who	need	 what 	 ever 	 	economic	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	they	can	get	.
let	's	make	it	personal	.
imagine	that	a	young	woman	--	base	of	the	economic	pyramid	,	 ver 	 y 	 	little	prospect	of	 get 	 ting 	 	a	job	--	what	economic	activity	could	she	 theoretic 	 ally 	 	engage	in	?
well	,	she	might	be	 will 	 ing 	 	to	work	odd	 hour 	 s 	 	in	a	call	center	,	in	a	 re 	 ception 	 	area	,	in	a	mail	room	.	she	may	be	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	local	 service 	 s 	 	to	her	community	:	 baby 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	,	local	 deliver 	 ies 	 	,	pet	care	.
she	may	have	 possess 	 ions 	 	that	she	would	like	to	trade	at	 time 	 s 	 	she	 do 	 es 	 	n't	need	them	.
so	she	might	have	a	 s 	 of 	 a 	 	bed	in	her	front	room	that	she	would	like	to	let	out	.
she	might	have	a	bike	,	a	video	 game 	 s 	 	 consol 	 e 	 	she	 on 	 ly 	 	uses	 occasion 	 ally 	 	.
and	you	're	 prob 	 ably 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	all	 ver 	 y 	 	web	-	aware	--	 y 	 es 	 	,	and	we	're	in	the	era	of	 collabor 	 ative 	 	consumption	,	so	she	can	go	 on 	 line 	 	and	do	all	 th 	 is 	 	.
she	can	go	to	airbnb	to	list	her	 s 	 of 	 a 	 	bed	,	she	can	go	to	taskrabbit.com	and	say	,	``	i	want	to	do	local	 deliver 	 ies 	 	,	``	and	so	on	.
these	are	good	 s 	 ites 	 	,	but	i	 believ 	 e 	 	we	can	go	a	step	further	.
and	the	key	to	that	is	a	 philosoph 	 y 	 	that	we	call	modern	 market 	 s 	 	for	all	.
 market 	 s 	 	have	 change 	 d 	 	beyond	 re 	 cognition 	 	in	the	last	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	but	 on 	 ly 	 	for	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	at	the	top	of	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
if	you	're	a	wall	street	 trade 	 r 	 	,	you	now	take	it	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	that	you	sell	your	financial	 asset 	 s 	 	in	a	system	of	 market 	 s 	 	that	 ident 	 ifies 	 	the	most	 profit 	 able 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	for	you	in	real	time	,	 execute 	 s 	 	on	that	in	 micro 	 second 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	 bound 	 aries 	 	you	've	set	.
it	 analyz 	 es 	 	supply	and	demand	and	 pric 	 ing 	 	and	 tell 	 s 	 	you	where	your	next	wave	of	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	are	coming	from	.
it	 manage 	 s 	 	counterparty	risk	in	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	ways	.
it	's	all	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	low	 over 	 head 	 	.
what	have	we	 gain 	 ed 	 	at	the	bottom	of	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 market 	 s 	 	in	the	last	20	 year 	 s 	 	?
 bas 	 ically 	 	 class 	 ified 	 	adverts	with	a	search	 facil 	 ity 	 	.
so	why	do	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	 dis 	 par 	 ity 	 	between	these	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	 market 	 s 	 	at	the	top	of	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	that	are	 increasing 	 ly 	 	 suck 	 ing 	 	more	and	more	activity	and	resource	out	of	the	main	 eco 	 nomy 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	rarefied	level	of	 tra 	 d 	 ing 	 	,	and	what	the	rest	of	us	have	?
a	modern	market	is	more	than	a	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	;	it	's	a	web	of	interoperable	 market 	 place 	 s 	 	,	back	 off 	 ice 	 	 mechan 	 ism 	 s 	 	,	 regulat 	 ory 	 	 regime 	 s 	 	,	 settle 	 ment 	 	 mechan 	 ism 	 s 	 	,	 liquid 	 ity 	 	 source 	 s 	 	and	so	on	.
and	when	a	wall	street	 trade 	 r 	 	 come 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	work	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	she	 do 	 es 	 	not	write	a	 list 	 ing 	 	for	every	financial	 deriv 	 ative 	 	she	 want 	 s 	 	to	sell	 to 	 day 	 	and	then	post	that	 list 	 ing 	 	on	 multi 	 ple 	 	 web 	 s 	 ites 	 	and	wait	for	potential	 buy 	 ers 	 	to	get	in	touch	and	start	 negoti 	 ating 	 	the	 term 	 s 	 	on	which	she	might	trade	.
in	the	early	 day 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	modern	 market 	 s 	 	technology	,	the	financial	 institution 	 s 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	out	how	they	could	leverage	 the 	 ir 	 	 buy 	 ing 	 	power	,	 the 	 ir 	 	back	 off 	 ice 	 	 process 	 es 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 relationship 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 network 	 s 	 	to	shape	these	new	 market 	 s 	 	that	would	create	all	 th 	 is 	 	new	activity	.
they	 ask 	 ed 	 	 government 	 s 	 	for	 support 	 ing 	 	 regulat 	 ory 	 	 regime 	 s 	 	,	and	in	a	lot	of	 case 	 s 	 	they	got	it	.
but	 through 	 out 	 	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	there	are	 facil 	 ities 	 	that	could	 like 	 wise 	 	leverage	a	new	generation	of	 market 	 s 	 	for	the	benefit	of	all	of	us	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	 facil 	 ities 	 	--	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 thing 	 s 	 	like	the	 mechan 	 ism 	 s 	 	that	prove	our	 ident 	 ity 	 	,	the	 licens 	 ing 	 	 author 	 ities 	 	that	know	what	each	of	us	is	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	do	 legal 	 ly 	 	at	any	 give 	 n 	 	time	,	the	 process 	 es 	 	by	which	we	 re 	 solve 	 	 disput 	 es 	 	through	official	 channel 	 s 	 	.
these	 mechan 	 ism 	 s 	 	,	these	 facil 	 ities 	 	are	not	in	the	gift	of	craigslist	or	gumtree	or	yahoo	,	they	're	controlled	by	the	state	.
and	the	 policy 	 makers 	 	who	 s 	 it 	 	on	top	of	them	are	,	i	suggest	,	 simpl 	 y 	 	not	 think 	 ing 	 	about	how	 t 	 hose 	 	 facil 	 ities 	 	could	be	used	to	 under 	 pin 	 	a	whole	new	era	of	 market 	 s 	 	.
like	 every 	 one 	 	else	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 policy 	 makers 	 	are	taking	it	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	that	modern	 market 	 s 	 	are	the	preserve	of	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	to	create	them	for	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
suppose	we	 stop 	 ped 	 	taking	that	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	.
suppose	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	the	prime	 mini 	 ster 	 	of	britain	or	the	 p 	 resident 	 	of	the	u.s.	,	or	the	 lead 	 er 	 	of	any	other	 develop 	 ed 	 	nation	,	 wok 	 e 	 	up	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'm	never	going	to	be	able	to	create	all	the	 job 	 s 	 	i	need	in	the	current	climate	.
i	have	got	to	focus	on	 what 	 ever 	 	economic	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	i	can	get	to	my	 citizen 	 s 	 	.
and	for	that	they	have	to	be	able	to	access	state	-	of	-	the	-	art	 market 	 s 	 	.
how	do	i	make	that	happen	?	``	and	i	think	i	can	see	a	few	 eye 	 s 	 	 roll 	 ing 	 	.
 politic 	 ians 	 	in	a	big	,	complex	,	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	i.t	.	project	?
oh	,	that	's	going	to	be	a	disaster	 wait 	 ing 	 	to	happen	.
not	 necess 	 arily 	 	.
there	is	a	 precede 	 nt 	 	for	technology	-	enabled	service	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 initi 	 ated 	 	by	 politic 	 ians 	 	in	 multi 	 ple 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	and	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 huge 	 ly 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	:	national	 lot 	 ter 	 ies 	 	.
let	's	take	britain	 a 	 s 	 	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
our	government	did	n't	design	the	national	 lot 	 ter 	 y 	 	,	it	did	n't	fund	the	national	 lot 	 ter 	 y 	 	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 oper 	 ate 	 	the	national	 lot 	 ter 	 y 	 	.
it	 simpl 	 y 	 	 pass 	 ed 	 	the	national	 lot 	 ter 	 y 	 	act	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 follow 	 ed 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	act	 define 	 s 	 	what	a	national	 lot 	 ter 	 y 	 	will	look	like	.
it	 spec 	 ifies 	 	certain	 benefit 	 s 	 	that	the	state	can	 un 	 ique 	 ly 	 	bestow	on	the	 oper 	 ators 	 	.
and	it	 put 	 s 	 	some	 oblig 	 ations 	 	on	 t 	 hose 	 	 oper 	 ators 	 	.
in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 spread 	 ing 	 	 gam 	 bling 	 	activity	to	the	 masse 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	an	unqualified	success	.
but	let	's	suppose	that	our	aim	is	to	 br 	 ing 	 	new	economic	activity	to	the	base	of	the	pyramid	.
could	we	use	the	same	model	?
i	 believ 	 e 	 	we	could	.
so	imagine	that	 policy 	 makers 	 	 out 	 lined 	 	a	 facil 	 ity 	 	.
let	's	call	it	national	e-markets	,	nems	for	short	.
think	of	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	 regulat 	 ed 	 	public	 util 	 ity 	 	.
so	it	's	on	a	par	with	the	water	supply	or	the	road	network	.
and	it	's	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 market 	 s 	 	for	low	-	level	trade	that	can	be	 fulfill 	 ed 	 	by	a	person	or	a	small	company	.
and	government	 ha 	 s 	 	certain	 benefit 	 s 	 	it	can	 un 	 ique 	 ly 	 	bestow	on	these	 market 	 s 	 	.
it	's	about	public	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	going	through	these	 market 	 s 	 	to	buy	public	 service 	 s 	 	at	the	local	level	.
it	's	about	interfacing	these	 market 	 s 	 	direct	 in 	 to 	 	the	highest	official	 channel 	 s 	 	in	the	land	.
it	's	about	enshrining	government	's	role	 a 	 s 	 	a	 public 	 ist 	 	for	these	 market 	 s 	 	.
it	's	about	deregulating	some	 sector 	 s 	 	so	that	local	people	can	enter	them	.
so	,	taxi	 journey 	 s 	 	might	be	one	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
and	there	are	certain	 oblig 	 ations 	 	that	should	go	with	 t 	 hose 	 	 benefit 	 s 	 	to	be	 place 	 d 	 	on	the	 oper 	 ators 	 	,	and	the	key	one	is	,	of	course	,	that	the	 oper 	 ators 	 	pay	for	 every 	 thing 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	all	the	interfacing	 in 	 to 	 	the	public	sector	.
so	imagine	that	the	 oper 	 ators 	 	make	 the 	 ir 	 	return	by	building	a	 percent 	 age 	 	 mark 	 up 	 	 in 	 to 	 	each	 trans 	 action 	 	.
imagine	that	there	's	a	concession	period	defined	of	 may 	 be 	 	15	 year 	 s 	 	in	which	they	can	take	all	these	 benefit 	 s 	 	and	run	with	them	.
and	imagine	that	the	 con 	 sort 	 ia 	 	who	bid	to	run	it	are	told	,	 who 	 ever 	 	 come 	 s 	 	in	at	the	 low 	 est 	 	 percent 	 age 	 	 mark 	 up 	 	on	each	 trans 	 action 	 	to	fund	the	whole	thing	will	get	the	deal	.
so	government	then	 exit 	 s 	 	the	frame	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	now	in	the	 hand 	 s 	 	of	the	 con 	 sort 	 ium 	 	.
either	they	are	going	to	 un 	 lock 	 	an	awful	lot	of	economic	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	and	make	a	 percent 	 age 	 	on	all	of	it	or	it	's	all	going	to	crash	and	burn	,	which	is	tough	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 share 	 holder 	 s 	 	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 both 	 er 	 	the	taxpayer	 necess 	 arily 	 	.
and	there	would	be	no	 constraint 	 s 	 	on	 alter 	 native 	 	 market 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	would	just	be	one	more	choice	among	 million 	 s 	 	of	 inter 	 net 	 	 forum 	 s 	 	.
but	it	could	be	 ver 	 y 	 	different	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	access	to	 t 	 hose 	 	state	-	 back 	 ed 	 	 facil 	 ities 	 	could	incentivize	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 sort 	 ium 	 	to	 serious 	 ly 	 	invest	in	the	service	.
 be 	 cause 	 	they	would	have	to	get	a	lot	of	these	small	 trans 	 action 	 s 	 	going	to	start	making	 the 	 ir 	 	return	.
so	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 sector 	 s 	 	like	home	hair	care	,	the	hire	of	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	,	farm	work	,	hire	of	 clothe 	 s 	 	even	,	 meal 	 s 	 	 deliver 	 ed 	 	to	your	door	,	 service 	 s 	 	for	 tourist 	 s 	 	,	home	care	.
 th 	 is 	 	would	be	a	world	of	 ver 	 y 	 	small	 trade 	 s 	 	,	but	 ver 	 y 	 	well	-	 inform 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	national	e-markets	will	deliver	data	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	local	person	 potential 	 ly 	 	 dec 	 id 	 ing 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	to	enter	the	 baby 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	market	.
and	they	might	be	aware	that	they	would	have	to	fund	vetting	and	training	if	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	that	market	.
they	'd	have	to	do	 assess 	 ment 	 	 interview 	 s 	 	with	local	 parent 	 s 	 	who	 want 	 ed 	 	a	pool	of	 babysitter 	 s 	 	.
is	it	worth	 the 	 ir 	 	while	?
should	they	be	looking	at	other	 sector 	 s 	 	?
should	they	be	moving	to	 an 	 other 	 	part	of	the	country	where	there	's	a	 short 	 age 	 	of	 babysitter 	 s 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	data	can	 be 	 come 	 	routine	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	data	can	be	used	by	 invest 	 ors 	 	.
so	if	there	's	a	problem	with	a	 short 	 age 	 	of	 babysitter 	 s 	 	in	some	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	country	and	the	problem	is	 no 	 body 	 	can	afford	the	vetting	and	training	,	an	 invest 	 or 	 	can	pay	for	it	and	the	system	will	 tith 	 e 	 	back	the	 enhance 	 d 	 	 earn 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	the	 individual 	 s 	 	for	 may 	 be 	 	the	next	two	 year 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	world	of	 atom 	 ized 	 	 capital 	 ism 	 	.
so	it	's	small	 trade 	 s 	 	by	small	people	,	but	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 inform 	 ed 	 	,	safe	,	convenient	,	low	-	 over 	 head 	 	and	 im 	 mediate 	 	.
