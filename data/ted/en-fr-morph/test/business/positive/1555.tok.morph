in	system	d	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	store	,	and	what	i	mean	by	that	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	photograph	i	took	in	makoko	,	 shanty 	 town 	 	in	lagos	,	nigeria	.
it	's	built	over	the	 lag 	 oon 	 	,	and	there	are	no	 street 	 s 	 	where	there	can	be	 store 	 s 	 	to	shop	,	and	so	the	store	 come 	 s 	 	to	you	.
and	in	the	same	community	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	business	 syn 	 er 	 gy 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	boat	that	that	 lad 	 y 	 	was	 padd 	 ling 	 	around	in	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	artisan	 make 	 s 	 	the	boat	and	the	 padd 	 les 	 	and	 sell 	 s 	 	 direct 	 ly 	 	to	the	people	who	need	the	boat	and	the	 padd 	 les 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	global	business	.
ogandiro	 smoke 	 s 	 	fish	in	makoko	in	lagos	,	and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	her	,	``	where	 do 	 es 	 	the	fish	come	from	?	``
and	i	thought	she	'd	say	,	``	oh	,	you	know	,	up	the	 lag 	 oon 	 	 some 	 where 	 	,	or	 may 	 be 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	africa	,	``
but	you	'll	be	happy	to	know	she	 s 	 aid 	 	it	came	from	here	,	it	 come 	 s 	 	from	the	north	sea	.
it	's	caught	here	,	 froze 	 n 	 	,	 ship 	 ped 	 	down	to	lagos	,	 smok 	 ed 	 	,	and	 s 	 old 	 	for	a	 tin 	 y 	 	increment	of	profit	on	the	 street 	 s 	 	of	lagos	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	business	 incub 	 ator 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	olusosun	dump	,	the	largest	garbage	dump	in	lagos	,	and	2,000	people	work	here	,	and	i	found	 th 	 is 	 	out	from	 th 	 is 	 	fellow	,	andrew	saboru	.

that	's	his	little	 de 	 pot 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	him	,	and	he	 earn 	 s 	 	twice	the	nigerian	 minim 	 um 	 	wage	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 shop 	 ping 	 	mall	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	oshodi	market	in	lagos	.
jorge	luis	borges	had	a	story	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	aleph	,	``	and	the	aleph	is	a	point	in	the	world	where	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	 exist 	 s 	 	,	and	for	me	,	 th 	 is 	 	image	is	a	point	in	the	world	where	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	 exist 	 s 	 	.
so	,	what	am	i	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	when	i	talk	about	system	d	?
it	's	 tradition 	 ally 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 inform 	 al 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	the	 under 	 ground 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	the	black	market	.
i	do	n't	 conceiv 	 e 	 	of	it	that	way	.
i	think	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	understand	that	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	is	 total 	 ly 	 	open	.	it	's	right	there	for	you	to	find	.
all	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	 open 	 ly 	 	,	and	aboveboard	.
there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	 under 	 ground 	 	about	it	.
it	's	our	prejudgment	that	it	's	 under 	 ground 	 	.
i	've	 pirate 	 d 	 	the	term	system	d	from	the	 form 	 er 	 	french	 colon 	 ies 	 	.
there	's	a	word	in	french	that	is	débrouillardise	,	that	 mean 	 s 	 	to	be	self	-	 reli 	 ant 	 	,	and	the	 form 	 er 	 	french	 colon 	 ies 	 	have	 turn 	 ed 	 	that	 in 	 to 	 	system	d	for	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	of	self	-	 reli 	 ance 	 	,	or	the	diy	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
but	 government 	 s 	 	hate	the	diy	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	and	that	's	why	--	i	took	 th 	 is 	 	picture	in	2007	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	same	market	in	2009	--	and	i	think	,	when	the	 organize 	 rs 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	radical	 open 	 ness 	 	,	they	did	n't	mean	that	the	 street 	 s 	 	should	be	open	and	the	people	should	be	gone	.
i	think	what	we	have	is	a	 pick 	 le 	 	problem	.
i	had	a	friend	who	 work 	 ed 	 	at	a	 pick 	 le 	 	 factor 	 y 	 	,
and	the	 cucumber 	 s 	 	would	come	 fly 	 ing 	 	down	 th 	 is 	 	conveyer	belt	,	and	his	job	was	to	pick	off	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	did	n't	look	so	good	and	throw	them	in	the	bin	 label 	 ed 	 	``	relish	``	where	they	'd	be	 crush 	 ed 	 	and	 mix 	 ed 	 	with	 vine 	 gar 	 	and	used	for	other	 kind 	 s 	 	of	profit	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 pick 	 le 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
we	're	all	 focus 	 ing 	 	on	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	statistic	from	 ear 	 lier 	 	 th 	 is 	 	month	in	the	financial	 time 	 s 	 	--	we	're	all	 focus 	 ing 	 	on	the	 luxur 	 y 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
it	's	worth	1.5	trillion	 dollar 	 s 	 	every	year	,	and	that	's	a	vast	amount	of	money	,	right	?
that	's	three	 time 	 s 	 	the	gross	domestic	product	of	switzerland	.
so	it	's	vast	.	but	it	should	come	with	an	asterisk	,	and	the	asterisk	is	that	it	 exclude 	 s 	 	two	 third 	 s 	 	of	the	 work 	 ers 	 	of	the	world	.
1.8	billion	people	around	the	world	work	in	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	that	is	 un 	 regulat 	 ed 	 	and	 inform 	 al 	 	.
that	's	a	huge	number	,	and	what	 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	?
well	,	it	 mean 	 s 	 	if	it	 we 	 re 	 	 unit 	 ed 	 	in	a	single	 politic 	 al 	 	system	,	one	country	,	call	it	``	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	street	sellers	 re 	 public 	 	,	``	the	u.s.s.r.	,	or	``	bazaaristan	,	``	it	would	be	worth	10	trillion	 dollar 	 s 	 	every	year	,	and	that	would	make	it	the	second	largest	 eco 	 nomy 	 	in	the	world	,	after	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
and	 give 	 n 	 	that	 project 	 ions 	 	are	that	the	bulk	of	economic	growth	over	the	next	15	 year 	 s 	 	will	come	from	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	,	it	could	 eas 	 ily 	 	 over 	 take 	 	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	and	 be 	 come 	 	the	largest	 eco 	 nomy 	 	in	the	world	.
so	the	 implic 	 ations 	 	of	that	are	vast	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	 employ 	 ment 	 	is	--	1.8	billion	people	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	we	can	create	a	more	egalitarian	world	,	 be 	 cause 	 	people	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	able	to	earn	money	and	live	and	 thriv 	 e 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	andrew	saboru	did	.
big	 business 	 es 	 	have	 recogn 	 ized 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	what	's	 fasci 	 nating 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	slide	,	it	's	not	that	the	 guy 	 s 	 	can	carry	boxes	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 head 	 s 	 	and	run	around	 with 	 out 	 	dropping	them	off	.	it	's	that	the	gala	sausage	roll	is	a	product	that	's	made	by	a	global	company	 call 	 ed 	 	uac	 food 	 s 	 	that	's	active	 through 	 out 	 	africa	and	the	middle	east	,	but	the	gala	sausage	roll	is	not	 s 	 old 	 	in	 store 	 s 	 	.
uac	 food 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 recogn 	 ized 	 	that	it	wo	n't	sell	if	it	's	in	 store 	 s 	 	.	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	 s 	 old 	 	by	a	 phal 	 anx 	 	of	street	hawkers	who	run	around	the	 street 	 s 	 	of	lagos	at	bus	 station 	 s 	 	and	in	traffic	 jam 	 s 	 	and	sell	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	snack	,	and	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 old 	 	that	way	for	40	 year 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	business	plan	for	a	corporation	.
and	it	's	not	just	in	africa	.
here	's	mr.	clean	looking	amorously	at	all	the	other	procter	&	gamble	 product 	 s 	 	,	and	procter	&	gamble	,	you	know	,	the	statistic	 al 	 ways 	 	 cit 	 ed 	 	is	that	wal	-	mart	is	 the 	 ir 	 	largest	 custom 	 er 	 	,	and	it	's	true	,	 a 	 s 	 	one	store	,	wal	-	mart	 buy 	 s 	 	15	percent	,	thus	15	percent	of	procter	&	gamble	's	business	is	with	wal	-	mart	,	but	 the 	 ir 	 	largest	market	segment	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	they	call	``	high	frequency	 store 	 s 	 	,	``	which	is	all	these	 tin 	 y 	 	 kiosk 	 s 	 	and	the	 lad 	 y 	 	in	the	canoe	and	all	these	other	 business 	 es 	 	that	exist	in	system	d	,	the	 inform 	 al 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	and	procter	&	gamble	 make 	 s 	 	20	percent	of	 it 	 s 	 	money	from	that	market	segment	,	and	it	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	market	segment	that	's	growing	.
so	procter	&	gamble	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	we	do	n't	care	 whet 	 her 	 	a	store	is	 incorpo 	 rated 	 	or	 register 	 ed 	 	or	 any 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
we	want	our	 product 	 s 	 	in	that	store	.	``
and	then	there	's	mobile	 phone 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	ad	for	mtn	,	which	is	a	south	african	 multi 	 national 	 	active	in	about	25	 count 	 ries 	 	,	and	when	they	came	 in 	 to 	 	nigeria	--	nigeria	is	the	big	dog	in	africa	.
one	in	seven	africans	is	a	nigerian	,	and	so	 every 	 one 	 	 want 	 s 	 	in	to	the	mobile	phone	market
in	nigeria	.	and	when	mtn	came	in	,	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	sell	the	mobile	service	like	i	get	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	or	like	people	get	here	in	the	u.k.	or	in	europe	--	expensive	 month 	 ly 	 	 plan 	 s 	 	,	you	get	a	phone	,	you	pay	overages	,	you	're	 kill 	 ed 	 	with	 fee 	 s 	 	--	and	 the 	 ir 	 	plan	 crash 	 ed 	 	and	 burn 	 ed 	 	.
and	they	went	back	to	the	 draw 	 ing 	 	board	,	and	they	retooled	,	and	they	came	up	with	 an 	 other 	 	plan	:	we	do	n't	sell	you	the	phone	,	we	do	n't	sell	you	the	 month 	 ly 	 	plan	.
we	 on 	 ly 	 	sell	you	 air 	 time 	 	.
and	where	's	the	 air 	 time 	 	 s 	 old 	 	?
it	's	 s 	 old 	 	at	 um 	 br 	 ella 	 	 stand 	 s 	 	all	over	the	 street 	 s 	 	,	where	people	are	unregistered	,	unlicensed	,	but	mtn	 make 	 s 	 	most	of	 it 	 s 	 	 profit 	 s 	 	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	90	percent	of	 it 	 s 	 	 profit 	 s 	 	,	from	selling	through	system	d	,	the	 inform 	 al 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
and	where	do	the	 phone 	 s 	 	come	from	?
well	,	they	come	from	here	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	in	guangzhou	,	 chin 	 a 	 	,	and	if	you	go	 up 	 stair 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	 sleep 	 y 	 	looking	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	mall	,	you	find	the	guangzhou	dashatou	second	-	hand	trade	center	,

they	're	going	to	 ed 	 dy 	 	in	lagos	.
now	,	most	of	the	 phone 	 s 	 	there	are	not	second	-	hand	at	all	.
the	name	is	a	misnomer	.
most	of	them	are	 pirate 	 d 	 	.	they	have	the	name	brand	on	them	,	but	they	're	not	 manufactur 	 ed 	 	by	the	name	brand	.
now	,	are	there	 down 	 side 	 s 	 	to	that	?
well	,	i	guess	.	you	know	,	 chin 	 a 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	no	--	--	no	intellectual	 proper 	 ty 	 	,	right	?
versace	 with 	 out 	 	the	vowels	.
zhuomani	 in 	 stead 	 	of	armani	.
s.	guuuci	,	and	--	all	around	the	world	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	 product 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 distribut 	 ed 	 	,	so	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	in	one	street	market	on	rua	25	de	março	in	são	paulo	,	brazil	,	you	can	buy	fake	 design 	 er 	 	 glass 	 es 	 	.
you	can	buy	 clon 	 ed 	 	cologne	.
you	can	buy	 pirate 	 d 	 	dvds	,	of	course	.
you	can	buy	new	york	yankees	 cap 	 s 	 	in	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 un 	 author 	 ized 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	.
you	can	buy	cuecas	baratas	,	 design 	 er 	 	 under 	 wear 	 	that	is	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 manufactur 	 ed 	 	by	a	 design 	 er 	 	,	and	even	 pirate 	 d 	 	 evangel 	 ical 	 	 mix 	 tape 	 s 	 	.
now	,	 business 	 es 	 	tend	to	complain	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	 the 	 ir 	 	,	they	,	i	do	n't	want	to	take	away	from	 the 	 ir 	 	entire	 valid 	 ity 	 	of	 complain 	 ing 	 	about	it	,	but	i	did	ask	a	major	 sneak 	 er 	 	 manufactur 	 er 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	what	they	thought	about	 pi 	 racy 	 	,
and	they	told	me	,	``	well	,	you	ca	n't	quote	me	on	 th 	 is 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	quote	me	on	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	have	to	kill	you	,	``	but	they	use	 pi 	 racy 	 	 a 	 s 	 	market	research	.
the	 sneak 	 er 	 	 manufactur 	 er 	 	told	me	that	if	they	find	that	pumas	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 pirate 	 d 	 	,	or	adidas	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 pirate 	 d 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 sneak 	 ers 	 	are	n't	 be 	 ing 	 	 pirate 	 d 	 	,	they	know	they	've	 d 	 one 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	wrong	.
so	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	them	to	track	 pi 	 racy 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	the	people	who	are	 buy 	 ing 	 	,	the	 pirate 	 s 	 	,	are	not	 the 	 ir 	 	 custom 	 ers 	 	 any 	 way 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 custom 	 ers 	 	want	the	real	deal	.
now	,	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	problem	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	real	street	sign	in	lagos	,	nigeria	.
all	of	system	d	 re 	 ally 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	pay	 tax 	 es 	 	,	right	?
and	when	i	think	about	that	,	first	of	all	i	think	that	government	is	a	social	contract	between	the	people	and	the	government	,	and	if	the	government	is	n't	 trans 	 parent 	 	,	then	the	people	are	n't	going	to	be	 trans 	 parent 	 	either	,
but	 al 	 so 	 	that	we	're	 b 	 lam 	 ing 	 	the	little	guy	who	 do 	 es 	 	n't	pay	his	 tax 	 es 	 	,	and	we	're	not	 recogn 	 izing 	 	that	 every 	 one 	 	's	fudging	 thing 	 s 	 	all	over	the	world	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	some	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 respect 	 ed 	 	 business 	 es 	 	,	and	i	'll	give	you	one	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
there	was	one	company	that	paid	4,000	 bribe 	 s 	 	in	the	first	decade	of	 th 	 is 	 	 mill 	 e 	 nnium 	 	,	and	a	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	 bribe 	 s 	 	every	business	day	,	right	?
all	over	the	world	.	and	that	company	was	the	big	german	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	giant	siemens	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 go 	 es 	 	on	in	the	 form 	 al 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	the	 inform 	 al 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	so	it	's	wrong	of	us	to	blame	--	and	i	'm	not	singling	out	siemens	,	i	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	 every 	 one 	 	 do 	 es 	 	it	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
i	just	want	to	end	by	 say 	 ing 	 	that	if	adam	smith	had	 frame 	 d 	 	out	a	 theor 	 y 	 	of	the	flea	market	 in 	 stead 	 	of	the	free	market	,	what	would	be	sum	of	the	 principle 	 s 	 	?
first	,	it	would	be	to	understand	that	it	could	be	 consider 	 ed 	 	a	 co 	 operative 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	thought	from	the	brazilian	legal	scholar	roberto	mangabeira	unger	.
 co 	 operative 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	is	a	way	forward	.
 second 	 ly 	 	,	from	the	[	austrian	]	anarchist	 philosoph 	 er 	 	paul	feyerabend	,	 fact 	 s 	 	are	 relat 	 ive 	 	,	and	what	is	a	massive	right	of	self	-	 reli 	 ance 	 	to	a	nigerian	 business 	 person 	 	is	 consider 	 ed 	 	 un 	 author 	 ized 	 	and	 horr 	 ible 	 	to	other	people	,	and	we	have	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	that	there	are	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	in	how	people	define	 thing 	 s 	 	and	what	 the 	 ir 	 	 fact 	 s 	 	are	.
and	third	is	,	and	i	'm	taking	 th 	 is 	 	from	the	great	american	beat	poet	allen	ginsberg	,	that	alternate	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	 bar 	 ter 	 	and	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 curr 	 ency 	 	,	alternate	 curr 	 encies 	 	are	 al 	 so 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	and	he	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	 buy 	 ing 	 	what	he	 need 	 ed 	 	just	with	his	good	 look 	 s 	 	.
and	so	i	just	want	to	 leav 	 e 	 	you	there	,	and	say	that	 th 	 is 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	is	a	tremendous	force	for	global	 develop 	 ment 	 	and	we	need	to	think	about	it	that	way	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
