so	,	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	have	ever	gotten	 be 	 hind 	 	the	wheel	of	a	car	when	you	 re 	 ally 	 	should	n't	have	 be 	 en 	 	 driv 	 ing 	 	?
 may 	 be 	 	you	're	out	on	the	road	for	a	long	day	,	and	you	just	 want 	 ed 	 	to	get	home	.
you	 we 	 re 	 	 tire 	 d 	 	,	but	you	felt	you	could	drive	a	few	more	 mile 	 s 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	you	thought	,	i	've	had	less	to	drink	than	 every 	 body 	 	else	,	i	should	be	the	one	to	go	home	.
or	 may 	 be 	 	your	mind	was	just	 entire 	 ly 	 	 else 	 where 	 	.
 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	sound	familiar	to	you	?
now	,	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 situ 	 ations 	 	,	would	n't	it	be	great	if	there	was	a	button	on	your	 dash 	 board 	 	that	you	could	push	,	and	the	car	would	get	you	home	 safe 	 ly 	 	?
now	,	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	the	promise	of	the	self	-	 driv 	 ing 	 	car	,	the	autonomous	vehicle	,	and	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	the	dream	since	at	 l 	 east 	 	1939	,	when	general	 motor 	 s 	 	 show 	 case 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	idea	at	 the 	 ir 	 	futurama	booth	at	the	world	's	fair	.
now	,	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 dream 	 s 	 	that	's	 al 	 ways 	 	 seem 	 ed 	 	about	20	 year 	 s 	 	in	the	future	.
now	,	two	 week 	 s 	 	ago	,	that	dream	took	a	step	forward	,	when	the	state	of	nevada	 grant 	 ed 	 	google	's	self	-	 driv 	 ing 	 	car	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	 licens 	 e 	 	for	an	autonomous	vehicle	,	 clear 	 ly 	 	 establish 	 ing 	 	that	it	's	legal	for	them	to	test	it	on	the	 road 	 s 	 	in	nevada	.
now	,	california	's	 consider 	 ing 	 	similar	 legisl 	 ation 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	would	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	the	autonomous	car	is	not	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	to	stay	in	vegas	.
now	,	in	my	lab	at	stanford	,	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	autonomous	 car 	 s 	 	too	,	but	with	a	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	different	spin	on	 thing 	 s 	 	.	you	see	,	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 develop 	 ing 	 	robotic	race	 car 	 s 	 	,	 car 	 s 	 	that	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	push	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 limit 	 s 	 	of	physical	performance	.
now	,	why	would	we	want	to	do	 s 	 uch 	 	a	thing	?
well	,	there	's	two	 re 	 ally 	 	good	 reason 	 s 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	.
first	,	we	 believ 	 e 	 	that	before	people	turn	over	control	to	an	autonomous	car	,	that	autonomous	car	should	be	at	 l 	 east 	 	 a 	 s 	 	good	 a 	 s 	 	the	 ver 	 y 	 	best	human	 driver 	 s 	 	.
now	,	if	you	're	like	me	,	and	the	other	70	percent	of	the	population	who	know	that	we	are	above	-	average	 driver 	 s 	 	,	you	understand	that	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	high	bar	.
there	's	 an 	 other 	 	reason	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
just	like	race	car	 driver 	 s 	 	can	use	all	of	the	friction	between	the	tire	and	the	road	,	all	of	the	car	's	 cap 	 abilities 	 	to	go	 a 	 s 	 	fast	 a 	 s 	 	possible	,	we	want	to	use	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 cap 	 abilities 	 	to	avoid	any	accident	we	can	.
now	,	you	may	push	the	car	to	the	 limit 	 s 	 	not	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	 driv 	 ing 	 	too	fast	,	but	 be 	 cause 	 	you	've	hit	an	 ic 	 y 	 	patch	of	road	,	 condition 	 s 	 	have	 change 	 d 	 	.
in	 t 	 hose 	 	 situ 	 ations 	 	,	we	want	a	car	that	is	 cap 	 able 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	to	avoid	any	accident	that	can	 physical 	 ly 	 	be	 avoid 	 ed 	 	.
i	must	confess	,	there	's	kind	of	a	third	 motiv 	 ation 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
you	see	,	i	have	a	 pass 	 ion 	 	for	 rac 	 ing 	 	.
in	the	past	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	a	race	car	owner	,	a	crew	chief	and	a	 driv 	 ing 	 	coach	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	 may 	 be 	 	not	at	the	level	that	you	're	 current 	 ly 	 	 expect 	 ing 	 	.
one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	've	 develop 	 ed 	 	in	the	lab	--	we	've	 develop 	 ed 	 	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 vehicle 	 s 	 	--	is	what	we	 believ 	 e 	 	is	the	world	's	first	 autonomous 	 ly 	 	 drift 	 ing 	 	car	.
it	's	 an 	 other 	 	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 categor 	 ies 	 	where	 may 	 be 	 	there	's	not	a	lot	of	 com 	 petition 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	p	1.	it	's	an	 entire 	 ly 	 	student	-	built	electric	vehicle	,	which	through	using	 it 	 s 	 	rear	-	wheel	drive	and	front	-	wheel	steer	-	by	-	wire	can	drift	around	 corner 	 s 	 	.
it	can	get	 side 	 ways 	 	like	a	 r 	 ally 	 	car	driver	,	 al 	 ways 	 	able	to	take	the	tightest	 curv 	 e 	 	,	even	on	 slip 	 per 	 y 	 	,	changing	 surface 	 s 	 	,	never	 s 	 pinning 	 	out	.
we	've	 al 	 so 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	with	volkswagen	 or 	 acle 	 	,	on	shelley	,	an	autonomous	race	car	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 rac 	 ed 	 	at	150	 mile 	 s 	 	an	hour	through	the	bonneville	salt	 flat 	 s 	 	,	gone	around	thunderhill	raceway	park	in	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	the	wind	and	the	rain	,	and	 navig 	 ated 	 	the	153	 turn 	 s 	 	and	12.4	 mile 	 s 	 	of	the	pikes	peak	hill	climb	route	in	colorado	with	 no 	 body 	 	at	the	wheel	.
i	guess	it	 go 	 es 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	that	we	've	had	a	lot	of	 f 	 un 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	in	fact	,	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	else	that	we	've	 develop 	 ed 	 	in	the	process	of	 develop 	 ing 	 	these	autonomous	 car 	 s 	 	.
we	have	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	tremendous	 appreci 	 ation 	 	for	the	 cap 	 abilities 	 	of	human	race	car	 driver 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	we	've	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	question	of	how	well	do	these	 car 	 s 	 	perform	,	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 compar 	 e 	 	them	to	our	human	 counter 	 part 	 s 	 	.
and	we	 discover 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	human	 counter 	 part 	 s 	 	are	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
now	,	we	can	take	a	map	of	a	race	track	,	we	can	take	a	 mathematic 	 al 	 	model	of	a	car	,	and	with	some	iteration	,	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	find	the	 fast 	 est 	 	way	around	that	track	.
we	line	that	up	with	data	that	we	record	from	a	professional	driver	,	and	the	 re 	 semblance 	 	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	there	are	subtle	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	here	,	but	the	human	race	car	driver	is	able	to	go	out	and	drive	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 ly 	 	fast	line	,	 with 	 out 	 	the	benefit	of	an	algorithm	that	 compar 	 es 	 	the	trade	-	off	between	going	 a 	 s 	 	fast	 a 	 s 	 	possible	in	 th 	 is 	 	corner	,	and	 s 	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	little	bit	of	time	off	of	the	straight	over	here	.
not	 on 	 ly 	 	that	,	they	're	able	to	do	it	lap	after	lap	after	lap	.
they	're	able	to	go	out	and	 consist 	 ent 	 ly 	 	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	 push 	 ing 	 	the	car	to	the	 limit 	 s 	 	every	single	time	.
it	's	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	to	watch	.
you	put	them	in	a	new	car	,	and	after	a	few	 lap 	 s 	 	,	they	've	found	the	 fast 	 est 	 	line	in	that	car	,	and	they	're	off	to	the	 race 	 s 	 	.
it	 re 	 ally 	 	 make 	 s 	 	you	think	,	we	'd	love	to	know	what	's	going	on	 in 	 side 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	brain	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	 research 	 ers 	 	,	that	's	what	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	find	out	.
we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	instrument	not	 on 	 ly 	 	the	car	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	the	race	car	driver	,	to	try	to	get	a	 glimps 	 e 	 	 in 	 to 	 	what	was	going	on	in	 the 	 ir 	 	head	 a 	 s 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	dr.	lene	harbott	 app 	 ly 	 ing 	 	 electro 	 de 	 s 	 	to	the	head	of	john	morton	.
john	morton	is	a	 form 	 er 	 	can	-	am	and	imsa	driver	,	who	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	class	champion	at	le	mans	.
fantastic	driver	,	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 will 	 ing 	 	to	put	up	with	graduate	 student 	 s 	 	and	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	research	.
she	's	 put 	 ting 	 	 electro 	 de 	 s 	 	on	his	head	so	that	we	can	monitor	the	 electric 	 al 	 	activity	in	john	's	brain	 a 	 s 	 	he	 race 	 s 	 	around	the	track	.
now	,	 clear 	 ly 	 	we	're	not	going	to	put	a	couple	of	 electro 	 de 	 s 	 	on	his	head	and	understand	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	all	of	his	 thought 	 s 	 	are	on	the	track	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	 neuro 	 scientist 	 s 	 	have	identified	certain	 pattern 	 s 	 	that	let	us	 teas 	 e 	 	out	some	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	the	 rest 	 ing 	 	brain	 tend 	 s 	 	to	generate	a	lot	of	alpha	 wave 	 s 	 	.
in	contrast	,	 the 	 ta 	 	 wave 	 s 	 	are	 associate 	 d 	 	with	a	lot	of	cognitive	activity	,	like	visual	 process 	 ing 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	where	the	driver	is	 think 	 ing 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	a	bit	.
now	,	we	can	measure	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	we	can	look	at	the	 relat 	 ive 	 	power	between	the	 the 	 ta 	 	 wave 	 s 	 	and	the	alpha	 wave 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 give 	 s 	 	us	a	measure	of	mental	 work 	 load 	 	,	how	much	the	driver	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 challeng 	 ed 	 	 cognitive 	 ly 	 	at	any	point	 a 	 long 	 	the	track	.
now	,	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	see	if	we	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	record	 th 	 is 	 	on	the	track	,	so	we	headed	down	south	to	laguna	seca	.
laguna	seca	is	a	 legend 	 ary 	 	raceway	about	 half 	 way 	 	between	salinas	and	monterey	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 curv 	 e 	 	there	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 cork 	 screw 	 	.
now	,	the	 cork 	 screw 	 	is	a	chicane	,	 follow 	 ed 	 	by	a	quick	right	-	 hand 	 ed 	 	turn	 a 	 s 	 	the	road	 drop 	 s 	 	three	 st 	 ories 	 	.
now	,	the	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	for	 driv 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 explain 	 ed 	 	to	me	was	,	you	aim	for	the	bush	in	the	distance	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	the	road	 fall 	 s 	 	away	,	you	 real 	 ize 	 	it	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	top	of	a	tree	.
all	right	,	so	 thank 	 s 	 	to	the	revs	program	at	stanford	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	take	john	there	and	put	him	 be 	 hind 	 	the	wheel	of	a	1960	porsche	abarth	carrera	.
life	is	way	too	short	for	 bor 	 ing 	 	 car 	 s 	 	.
so	,	here	you	see	john	on	the	track	,	he	's	going	up	the	hill	--	oh	!	 some 	 body 	 	 like 	 d 	 	that	--	and	you	can	see	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	his	mental	 work 	 load 	 	--	 measur 	 ing 	 	here	in	the	red	bar	--	you	can	see	his	 action 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	he	 approach 	 es 	 	.
now	watch	,	he	 ha 	 s 	 	to	 down 	 shift 	 	.
and	then	he	 ha 	 s 	 	to	turn	left	.
look	for	the	tree	,	and	down	.
not	 surprising 	 ly 	 	,	you	can	see	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	 challeng 	 ing 	 	task	.
you	can	see	his	mental	 work 	 load 	 	spike	 a 	 s 	 	he	 go 	 es 	 	through	 th 	 is 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	would	expect	with	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 requir 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	level	of	 complex 	 ity 	 	.
but	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	to	look	at	 area 	 s 	 	of	the	track	where	his	mental	 work 	 load 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 in 	 crease 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	take	you	around	now	to	the	other	side	of	the	track	.
turn	three	.	and	john	's	going	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	that	corner	and	the	rear	end	of	the	car	is	going	to	begin	to	slide	out	.
he	's	going	to	have	to	correct	for	that	with	 steer 	 ing 	 	.
so	watch	 a 	 s 	 	john	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	here	.
watch	the	mental	 work 	 load 	 	,	and	watch	the	 steer 	 ing 	 	.
the	car	 begin 	 s 	 	to	slide	out	,	 dramat 	 ic 	 	maneuver	to	correct	it	,	and	no	change	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	in	the	mental	 work 	 load 	 	.
not	a	 challeng 	 ing 	 	task	.
in	fact	,	 entire 	 ly 	 	reflexive	.
now	,	our	data	 process 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	is	still	 pre 	 liminary 	 	,	but	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 seem 	 s 	 	that	these	 phenomen 	 al 	 	 feat 	 s 	 	that	the	race	car	 driver 	 s 	 	are	 perform 	 ing 	 	are	 instinct 	 ive 	 	.
they	are	 thing 	 s 	 	that	they	have	 simpl 	 y 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	to	do	.
it	 requir 	 es 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	little	mental	 work 	 load 	 	for	them	to	perform	these	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 feat 	 s 	 	.
and	 the 	 ir 	 	 action 	 s 	 	are	fantastic	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	you	want	to	do	on	the	 steer 	 ing 	 	wheel	to	catch	the	car	in	 th 	 is 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 give 	 n 	 	us	tremendous	 in 	 sight 	 	and	inspiration	for	our	own	autonomous	 vehicle 	 s 	 	.
we	've	 start 	 ed 	 	to	ask	the	question	:	can	we	make	them	a	little	less	 algorithm 	 ic 	 	and	a	little	more	intuitive	?
can	we	take	 th 	 is 	 	reflexive	action	that	we	see	from	the	 ver 	 y 	 	best	race	car	 driver 	 s 	 	,	 introduc 	 e 	 	it	to	our	 car 	 s 	 	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	even	 in 	 to 	 	a	system	that	could	get	onto	your	car	in	the	future	?
that	would	take	us	a	long	step	 a 	 long 	 	the	road	to	autonomous	 vehicle 	 s 	 	that	drive	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	the	best	 human 	 s 	 	.
but	it	's	made	us	think	a	little	bit	more	 deep 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
do	we	want	 some 	 thing 	 	more	from	our	car	than	to	 simpl 	 y 	 	be	a	 cha 	 uffeur 	 	?
do	we	want	our	car	to	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	be	a	partner	,	a	coach	,	 some 	 one 	 	that	can	use	 the 	 ir 	 	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	to	help	us	reach	our	potential	?
can	,	in	fact	,	the	technology	not	 simpl 	 y 	 	replace	 human 	 s 	 	,	but	allow	us	to	reach	the	level	of	 re 	 flex 	 	and	 intuit 	 ion 	 	that	we	're	all	 cap 	 able 	 	of	?
so	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	move	forward	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 techno 	 logical 	 	future	,	i	want	you	to	just	pause	and	think	of	that	for	a	moment	.
what	is	the	ideal	balance	of	human	and	machine	?
and	 a 	 s 	 	we	think	about	that	,	let	's	take	inspiration	from	the	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 cap 	 abilities 	 	of	the	human	body	and	the	human	mind	.
thank	you	.
