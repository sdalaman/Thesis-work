 th 	 is 	 	is	the	natural	 histo 	 ry 	 	museum	in	rotterdam	,	where	i	work	 a 	 s 	 	a	 cur 	 ator 	 	.
it	's	my	job	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	the	 collect 	 ion 	 	 stay 	 s 	 	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	and	that	it	 grow 	 s 	 	,	and	 bas 	 ically 	 	it	 mean 	 s 	 	i	collect	dead	 animal 	 s 	 	.
back	in	1995	,	we	got	a	new	wing	next	to	the	museum	.
it	was	made	of	glass	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	building	 re 	 ally 	 	 help 	 ed 	 	me	to	do	my	job	good	.
the	building	was	a	true	bird	-	killer	.
you	may	know	that	 bird 	 s 	 	do	n't	understand	the	 con 	 cept 	 	of	glass	.	they	do	n't	see	it	,	so	they	fly	 in 	 to 	 	the	 window 	 s 	 	and	get	 kill 	 ed 	 	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	i	had	to	do	was	go	out	,	pick	them	up	,	and	have	them	 stuff 	 ed 	 	for	the	 collect 	 ion 	 	.
and	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 day 	 s 	 	,	i	 develop 	 ed 	 	an	ear	to	identify	 bird 	 s 	 	just	by	the	sound	of	the	 bang 	 s 	 	they	made	against	the	glass	.
and	it	was	on	june	5	,	1995	,	that	i	heard	a	loud	bang	against	the	glass	that	 change 	 d 	 	my	life	and	 end 	 ed 	 	that	of	a	duck	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	saw	when	i	 look 	 ed 	 	out	of	the	window	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	dead	duck	.	it	flew	against	the	window	.
it	's	 lay 	 ing 	 	dead	on	 it 	 s 	 	 bel 	 ly 	 	.
but	next	to	the	dead	duck	is	a	live	duck	,	and	 pleas 	 e 	 	pay	attention	.
both	are	of	the	male	 s 	 ex 	 	.
and	then	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
the	live	duck	 mount 	 ed 	 	the	dead	duck	,	and	 start 	 ed 	 	to	 copul 	 ate 	 	.
well	,	i	'm	a	biologist	.	i	'm	an	 ornitho 	 logist 	 	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 some 	 thing 	 	's	wrong	here	.	``	one	is	dead	,	one	is	 al 	 ive 	 	.	that	must	be	 necro 	 philia 	 	.
i	look	.	both	are	of	the	male	 s 	 ex 	 	.
 homo 	 sexual 	 	 necro 	 philia 	 	.
so	i	--	i	took	my	camera	,	i	took	my	 note 	 book 	 	,	took	a	chair	,	and	 start 	 ed 	 	to	 observ 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	behavior	.
after	75	 minute 	 s 	 	--	--	i	had	 s 	 een 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	and	i	got	 hung 	 ry 	 	,	and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	go	home	.
so	i	went	out	,	 collect 	 ed 	 	the	duck	,	and	before	i	put	it	in	the	 freeze 	 r 	 	,	i	 check 	 ed 	 	if	the	victim	was	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	of	the	male	 s 	 ex 	 	.
and	here	's	a	rare	picture	of	a	duck	's	penis	,	so	it	was	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	of	the	male	 s 	 ex 	 	.
it	's	a	rare	picture	 be 	 cause 	 	there	are	10,000	species	of	 bird 	 s 	 	and	 on 	 ly 	 	300	possess	a	penis	.
[	the	first	case	of	 homo 	 sexual 	 	 necro 	 philia 	 	in	the	 mall 	 ard 	 	anas	 plat 	 yrhynchos 	 	]	i	 k 	 new 	 	i	'd	 s 	 een 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	special	,	but	it	took	me	six	 year 	 s 	 	to	decide	to	publish	it	.
i	mean	,	it	's	a	nice	 top 	 ic 	 	for	a	 birth 	 day 	 	party	or	at	the	coffee	machine	,	but	to	share	 th 	 is 	 	among	your	 peer 	 s 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	different	.
i	did	n't	have	the	 frame 	 work 	 	.
so	after	six	 year 	 s 	 	,	my	 friend 	 s 	 	and	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	 urge 	 d 	 	me	to	publish	,	so	i	 publish 	 ed 	 	``	the	first	case	of	 homo 	 sexual 	 	 necro 	 philia 	 	in	the	 mall 	 ard 	 	.	``	and	here	's	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
a	is	my	 off 	 ice 	 	,	b	is	the	place	where	the	duck	hit	the	glass	,	and	c	is	from	where	i	 watch 	 ed 	 	it	.
and	here	are	the	 duck 	 s 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	know	,	in	science	,	when	you	write	a	kind	of	special	paper	,	 on 	 ly 	 	six	or	seven	people	read	it	.
but	then	 some 	 thing 	 	good	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
i	got	a	phone	call	from	a	person	 call 	 ed 	 	marc	abrahams	,	and	he	told	me	,	``	you	've	won	a	prize	with	your	duck	paper	:	the	ig	 no 	 bel 	 	prize	.	``	and	the	ig	 no 	 bel 	 	prize	--	--	the	ig	 no 	 bel 	 	prize	 honor 	 s 	 	research	that	first	 make 	 s 	 	people	laugh	,	and	then	 make 	 s 	 	them	think	,	with	the	ultimate	goal	to	make	more	people	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	science	.
that	's	a	good	thing	,	so	i	 accept 	 ed 	 	the	prize	.
i	went	--	let	me	 re 	 mind 	 	you	that	marc	abrahams	did	n't	call	me	from	stockholm	.
he	 call 	 ed 	 	me	from	cambridge	,	massachusetts	.
so	i	 travel 	 ed 	 	to	boston	,	to	cambridge	,	and	i	went	to	 th 	 is 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	ig	 no 	 bel 	 	prize	 ce 	 re 	 mon 	 y 	 	held	at	harvard	university	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 ce 	 re 	 mon 	 y 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	nice	experience	.
real	 no 	 bel 	 	 laureate 	 s 	 	hand	you	the	prize	.
that	's	the	first	thing	.
and	there	are	nine	other	 winner 	 s 	 	who	get	 prize 	 s 	 	.
here	's	one	of	my	fellow	 winner 	 s 	 	.	that	's	charles	paxton	who	won	the	2000	biology	prize	for	his	paper	,	``	 court 	 ship 	 	behavior	of	 ostrich 	 es 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 human 	 s 	 	under	 farm 	 ing 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	in	britain	.	``
and	i	think	there	are	one	or	two	more	ig	 no 	 bel 	 	prize	 winner 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	.

dan	won	his	prize	in	medicine	for	 demonst 	 rating 	 	that	high	-	priced	fake	medicine	 work 	 s 	 	better	than	low	-	priced	fake	medicine	.
so	here	's	my	one	minute	of	fame	,	my	 accept 	 ance 	 	speech	,	and	here	's	the	duck	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 it 	 s 	 	first	time	on	the	u.s.	west	coast	.
i	'm	going	to	pass	it	around	.	 yea 	 h 	 	?
you	can	pass	it	around	.
 pleas 	 e 	 	note	it	's	a	museum	specimen	,	but	there	's	no	chance	you	'll	get	the	 av 	 ian 	 	flu	.
after	winning	 th 	 is 	 	prize	,	my	life	 change 	 d 	 	.
in	the	first	place	,	people	 start 	 ed 	 	to	 s 	 end 	 	me	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	duck	-	related	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	i	got	a	real	nice	 collect 	 ion 	 	.
more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	people	 start 	 ed 	 	to	 s 	 end 	 	me	 the 	 ir 	 	 observ 	 ations 	 	of	 remark 	 able 	 	animal	behavior	,	and	 believ 	 e 	 	me	,	if	there	's	an	animal	 mis 	 behav 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	,	i	know	about	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 mo 	 ose 	 	.
it	's	a	 mo 	 ose 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 copul 	 ate 	 	with	a	 bron 	 ze 	 	statue	of	a	 bi 	 son 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	in	montana	,	2008	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	frog	that	tries	to	 copul 	 ate 	 	with	a	 gold 	 fish 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	netherlands	,	2011	.
these	are	 can 	 e 	 	 to 	 ad 	 s 	 	in	australia	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 road 	 kill 	 	.
 pleas 	 e 	 	note	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	 necro 	 philia 	 	.
it	's	 remark 	 able 	 	:	the	position	.
the	 mission 	 ary 	 	position	is	 ver 	 y 	 	rare	in	the	animal	 king 	 dom 	 	.
these	are	 pigeon 	 s 	 	in	rotterdam	.
barn	 swallow 	 s 	 	in	hong	kong	,	2004	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 tur 	 key 	 	in	wisconsin	on	the	 pre 	 mis 	 es 	 	of	the	ethan	allen	juvenile	 correct 	 ional 	 	institution	.
it	took	all	day	,	and	the	 prisoner 	 s 	 	had	a	great	time	.
so	what	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	mean	?
i	mean	,	the	question	i	ask	 my 	 self 	 	,	why	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	happen	in	nature	?
well	,	what	i	 conclude 	 d 	 	from	 review 	 ing 	 	all	these	 case 	 s 	 	is	that	it	is	 import 	 ant 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	when	death	is	instant	and	in	a	 dramat 	 ic 	 	way	and	in	the	right	position	for	 copul 	 ation 	 	.
at	 l 	 east 	 	,	i	thought	it	was	till	i	got	these	 slide 	 s 	 	.
and	here	you	see	a	dead	duck	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	there	for	three	 day 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	 lay 	 ing 	 	on	 it 	 s 	 	back	.
so	there	 go 	 es 	 	my	 theor 	 y 	 	of	 necro 	 philia 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	the	impact	of	glass	 building 	 s 	 	on	the	life	of	 bird 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	mad	max	,	a	 black 	 bird 	 	who	 live 	 s 	 	in	rotterdam	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	 th 	 is 	 	bird	did	was	fly	against	 th 	 is 	 	window	from	2004	to	2008	,	day	in	and	day	out	.
here	he	 go 	 es 	 	,	and	here	's	a	short	video	.
so	what	 th 	 is 	 	bird	 do 	 es 	 	is	fight	his	own	image	.
he	 s 	 ees 	 	an	 intrud 	 er 	 	in	his	 territ 	 ory 	 	,	and	it	's	coming	all	the	time	and	he	's	there	,	so	there	is	no	end	to	it	.
and	i	thought	,	in	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	--	i	 stud 	 ied 	 	 th 	 is 	 	bird	for	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	--	that	,	well	,	should	n't	the	brain	of	 th 	 is 	 	bird	be	 damage 	 d 	 	?
it	's	not	.	i	show	you	here	some	 slide 	 s 	 	,	some	 frame 	 s 	 	from	the	video	,	and	at	the	last	moment	before	he	 hit 	 s 	 	the	glass	,	he	 put 	 s 	 	his	feet	in	front	,	and	then	he	 bang 	 s 	 	against	the	glass	.
so	i	'll	conclude	to	 invit 	 e 	 	you	all	to	dead	duck	day	.
that	's	on	june	5	every	year	.
at	five	 minute 	 s 	 	to	six	in	the	afternoon	,	we	come	together	at	the	natural	 histo 	 ry 	 	museum	in	rotterdam	,	the	duck	 come 	 s 	 	out	of	the	museum	,	and	we	try	to	discuss	new	ways	to	prevent	 bird 	 s 	 	from	 coll 	 id 	 ing 	 	with	 window 	 s 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	know	,	or	 a 	 s 	 	you	may	not	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	major	 cause 	 s 	 	of	death	for	 bird 	 s 	 	in	the	world	.
in	the	u.s.	 al 	 one 	 	,	a	billion	 bird 	 s 	 	die	in	collision	with	glass	 building 	 s 	 	.
and	when	it	's	over	,	we	go	to	a	chinese	restaurant	and	we	have	a	six	-	course	duck	 d 	 inner 	 	.
so	i	hope	to	see	you	next	year	in	rotterdam	,	the	netherlands	,	for	dead	duck	day	.
thank	you	.
oh	,	sorry	.
may	i	have	my	duck	back	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	?
thank	you	.
