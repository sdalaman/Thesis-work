i	'm	here	to	show	you	how	 some 	 thing 	 	you	ca	n't	see	can	be	so	much	 f 	 un 	 	to	look	at	.
you	're	about	to	experience	a	new	,	 avail 	 able 	 	and	 excit 	 ing 	 	technology	that	's	going	to	make	us	 re 	 think 	 	how	we	 water 	 proof 	 	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
what	i	have	here	is	a	 ci 	 nder 	 	block	that	we	've	 co 	 ated 	 	half	with	a	 nano 	 technology 	 	spray	that	can	be	 appli 	 ed 	 	to	 al 	 most 	 	any	material	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	ultra	-	ever	dry	,	and	when	you	 app 	 ly 	 	it	to	any	material	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 super 	 hydro 	 phobic 	 	shield	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ci 	 nder 	 	block	,	 un 	 co 	 ated 	 	,	and	you	can	see	that	it	's	 por 	 ous 	 	,	it	 absorb 	 s 	 	water	.
not	 any 	 more 	 	.
 por 	 ous 	 	,	 non 	 por 	 ous 	 	.
so	what	's	 super 	 hydro 	 phobic 	 	?
 super 	 hydro 	 phobic 	 	is	how	we	measure	a	drop	of	water	on	a	surface	.
the	 round 	 er 	 	it	is	,	the	more	 hydro 	 phobic 	 	it	is	,	and	if	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	round	,	it	's	 super 	 hydro 	 phobic 	 	.
a	 fresh 	 ly 	 	 wax 	 ed 	 	car	,	the	water	 molecule 	 s 	 	 s 	 lump 	 	to	about	90	 degree 	 s 	 	.
a	 wind 	 shield 	 	 co 	 ating 	 	is	going	to	give	you	about	110	 degree 	 s 	 	.
but	what	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	here	is	160	to	175	 degree 	 s 	 	,	and	 any 	 thing 	 	over	150	is	 super 	 hydro 	 phobic 	 	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	the	 demonst 	 ration 	 	,	what	i	have	is	a	pair	of	 glove 	 s 	 	,	and	we	've	 co 	 ated 	 	one	of	the	 glove 	 s 	 	with	the	 nano 	 technology 	 	 co 	 ating 	 	,	and	let	's	see	if	you	can	tell	which	one	,	and	i	'll	give	you	a	hint	.
did	you	guess	the	one	that	was	dry	?
when	you	have	 nano 	 technology 	 	and	 nano 	 science 	 	,	what	's	 occur 	 red 	 	is	that	we	're	able	to	now	look	at	 atom 	 s 	 	and	 molecule 	 s 	 	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	control	them	for	great	 benefit 	 s 	 	.
and	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	small	here	.
the	way	you	measure	 nano 	 technology 	 	is	in	 nano 	 meter 	 s 	 	,	and	one	 nano 	 meter 	 	is	a	 billion 	 th 	 	of	a	meter	,
and	to	put	some	scale	to	that	,	if	you	had	a	 nano 	 particle 	 	that	was	one	 nano 	 meter 	 	thick	,	and	you	put	it	side	by	side	,	and	you	had	50,000	of	them	,	you	'd	be	the	width	of	a	human	hair	.
so	 ver 	 y 	 	small	,	but	 ver 	 y 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	.
and	it	's	not	just	water	that	 th 	 is 	 	 work 	 s 	 	with	.	it	's	a	lot	of	water	-	based	 material 	 s 	 	like	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	,	water	-	based	paint	,	mud	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	some	 refine 	 d 	 	 oil 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
you	can	see	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
moving	onto	the	next	 demonst 	 ration 	 	,	we	've	taken	a	pane	of	glass	and	we	've	 co 	 ated 	 	the	 out 	 side 	 	of	it	,	we	've	 frame 	 d 	 	it	with	the	 nano 	 technology 	 	 co 	 ating 	 	,	and	we	're	going	to	pour	 th 	 is 	 	green	-	 tin 	 ted 	 	water	 in 	 side 	 	the	middle	,	and	you	're	going	to	see	,	it	's	going	to	spread	out	on	glass	like	you	'd	 normal 	 ly 	 	think	it	would	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	when	it	 hit 	 s 	 	the	 co 	 ating 	 	,	it	 stop 	 s 	 	,	and	i	ca	n't	even	coax	it	to	 leav 	 e 	 	.
it	's	that	 af 	 raid 	 	of	the	water	.
so	what	's	going	on	here	?	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	?
well	,	the	surface	of	the	spray	 co 	 ating 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	 nano 	 particle 	 s 	 	that	form	a	 ver 	 y 	 	rough	and	 cragg 	 ly 	 	surface	.
you	'd	think	it	'd	be	smooth	,	but	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	not	.
and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 inter 	 stit 	 ial 	 	 space 	 s 	 	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	 space 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 long 	 	with	the	 nano 	 particle 	 s 	 	,	reach	up	and	grab	the	air	 molecule 	 s 	 	,	and	cover	the	surface	with	air	.
it	's	an	 um 	 br 	 ella 	 	of	air	all	 a 	 cross 	 	it	,
and	that	layer	of	air	is	what	the	water	 hit 	 s 	 	,	the	mud	 hit 	 s 	 	,	the	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	 hit 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 glide 	 s 	 	right	off	.
so	if	i	put	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 side 	 	 th 	 is 	 	water	here	,	you	can	see	a	silver	 reflect 	 ive 	 	 co 	 ating 	 	around	it	,	and	that	silver	 reflect 	 ive 	 	 co 	 ating 	 	is	the	layer	of	air	that	's	 protect 	 ing 	 	the	water	from	 touch 	 ing 	 	the	 padd 	 le 	 	,	and	it	's	dry	.
so	what	are	the	 application 	 s 	 	?
i	mean	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	right	now	are	 prob 	 ably 	 	going	through	your	head	.
 every 	 one 	 	that	 s 	 ees 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 get 	 s 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	,	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	oh	,	i	could	use	it	for	 th 	 is 	 	and	 th 	 is 	 	and	 th 	 is 	 	.	``	the	 application 	 s 	 	in	a	general	sense	could	be	 any 	 thing 	 	that	's	anti	-	wetting	.	we	've	 certain 	 ly 	 	 s 	 een 	 	that	 to 	 day 	 	.
it	could	be	 any 	 thing 	 	that	's	anti	-	 ic 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	do	n't	have	water	,	you	do	n't	have	ice	.
it	could	be	anti	-	 corros 	 ion 	 	.
no	water	,	no	 corros 	 ion 	 	.
it	could	be	anti	-	bacterial	.
 with 	 out 	 	water	,	the	bacteria	wo	n't	 surviv 	 e 	 	.
and	it	could	be	 thing 	 s 	 	that	need	to	be	self	-	 clean 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
so	imagine	how	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	could	help	 revolution 	 ize 	 	your	field	of	work	.
and	i	'm	going	to	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	one	last	 demonst 	 ration 	 	,	but	before	i	do	that	,	i	would	like	to	say	thank	you	,	and	think	small	.
it	's	going	to	happen	.	wait	for	it	.	wait	for	it	.
