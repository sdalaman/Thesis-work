so	,	before	i	 be 	 came 	 	a	dermatologist	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	in	general	medicine	,	 a 	 s 	 	most	 der 	 ma 	 to 	 logists 	 	do	in	britain	.
at	the	end	of	that	time	,	i	went	off	to	australia	,	about	20	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
what	you	learn	when	you	go	to	australia	is	the	australians	are	 ver 	 y 	 	competitive	.
and	they	are	not	magnanimous	in	 vict 	 ory 	 	.
and	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	a	lot	:	``	you	pommies	,	you	ca	n't	play	cricket	,	 rug 	 by 	 	.	``	i	could	accept	that	.
but	moving	 in 	 to 	 	work	--	and	we	have	each	week	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	a	journal	club	,	when	you	'd	 s 	 it 	 	down	with	the	other	 doctor 	 s 	 	and	you	'd	 stud 	 y 	 	a	scientific	paper	in	relation	to	medicine	.
and	after	week	one	,	it	was	about	 cardio 	 vascular 	 	 mortal 	 ity 	 	,	a	dry	subject	--	how	 man 	 y 	 	people	die	of	heart	disease	,	what	the	rates	are	.
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	competitive	about	 th 	 is 	 	:	``	you	pommies	,	your	rates	of	heart	disease	are	 shock 	 ing 	 	.	``
and	of	course	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	right	.
australians	have	about	a	third	less	heart	disease	than	we	do	--	less	 death 	 s 	 	from	heart	 attack 	 s 	 	,	heart	failure	,	less	 stroke 	 s 	 	--	they	're	 general 	 ly 	 	a	 health 	 ier 	 	bunch	.
and	of	course	they	 s 	 aid 	 	 th 	 is 	 	was	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	fine	moral	 stand 	 ing 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 exercis 	 e 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	australians	and	we	're	weedy	pommies	,	and	so	on	.	but	it	's	not	just	australia	that	 ha 	 s 	 	better	health	than	britain	.
 with 	 in 	 	britain	,	there	is	a	 grad 	 ient 	 	of	health	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	 standard 	 ized 	 	 mortal 	 ity 	 	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	your	 chance 	 s 	 	of	 dy 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	looking	at	data	from	the	paper	about	20	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	but	it	's	true	 to 	 day 	 	.
 compar 	 ing 	 	your	rates	of	 dy 	 ing 	 	50	 degree 	 s 	 	north	--	that	's	the	south	,	that	's	london	and	 place 	 s 	 	--	by	latitude	,	and	55	 degree 	 s 	 	--	the	bad	news	is	that	's	here	,	glasgow	.
i	'm	from	edinburgh	.	 wo 	 rse 	 	news	,	that	's	even	edinburgh	.
so	what	 account 	 s 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	 horr 	 ible 	 	space	here	between	us	up	here	in	southern	scotland	and	the	south	?
now	,	we	know	about	 smok 	 ing 	 	,	deep	-	fried	mars	 bar 	 s 	 	,	 chip 	 s 	 	--	the	glasgow	diet	.
all	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	graph	is	after	taking	 in 	 to 	 	account	all	of	these	known	risk	 factor 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	after	 account 	 ing 	 	for	 smok 	 ing 	 	,	social	class	,	diet	,	all	 t 	 hose 	 	other	known	risk	 factor 	 s 	 	.
we	are	left	with	 th 	 is 	 	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	space	of	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	 death 	 s 	 	the	further	north	you	go	.
now	,	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	,	of	course	,	 come 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	 vita 	 min 	 	d	 ha 	 s 	 	had	a	great	deal	of	press	,	and	a	lot	of	people	get	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	it	.
and	we	need	 vita 	 min 	 	d.	it	's	now	a	 requir 	 ement 	 	that	children	have	a	certain	amount	.
my	 grand 	 mother 	 	grew	up	in	glasgow	,	back	in	the	1920s	and	'30s	when	rickets	was	a	real	problem	and	cod	liver	oil	was	 br 	 ought 	 	in	.
and	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 prevent 	 ed 	 	the	rickets	that	used	to	be	common	in	 th 	 is 	 	city	.
and	i	 a 	 s 	 	a	child	was	fed	cod	liver	oil	by	my	 grand 	 mother 	 	.
i	 distinct 	 ly 	 	--	 no 	 body 	 	forgets	cod	liver	oil	.
but	an	 associ 	 ation 	 	:	the	 high 	 er 	 	people	's	blood	 level 	 s 	 	of	 vita 	 min 	 	d	are	,	the	less	heart	disease	they	have	,	the	less	cancer	.
there	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	a	lot	of	data	 suggest 	 ing 	 	that	 vita 	 min 	 	d	is	 ver 	 y 	 	good	for	you	.
and	it	is	,	to	prevent	rickets	and	so	on	.
but	if	you	give	people	 vita 	 min 	 	d	 supplement 	 s 	 	,	you	do	n't	change	that	high	rate	of	heart	disease	.
and	the	evidence	for	it	 prevent 	 ing 	 	 cancer 	 s 	 	is	not	yet	great	.
so	what	i	'm	going	to	suggest	is	that	 vita 	 min 	 	d	is	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	story	in	town	.
it	's	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	reason	 prevent 	 ing 	 	heart	disease	.
high	 vita 	 min 	 	d	 level 	 s 	 	,	i	think	,	are	a	marker	for	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	 expo 	 s 	 ure 	 	,	and	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	 expo 	 s 	 ure 	 	,	in	 method 	 s 	 	i	'm	going	to	show	,	is	good	for	heart	disease	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	i	came	back	from	australia	,	and	 de 	 spite 	 	the	obvious	 risk 	 s 	 	to	my	health	,	i	 move 	 d 	 	to	aberdeen	.
now	,	in	aberdeen	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	my	dermatology	training	.
but	i	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 came 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	research	,	and	in	 part 	 icular 	 	i	 be 	 came 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 sub 	 stance 	 	,	nitric	oxide	.
now	these	three	 guy 	 s 	 	up	here	,	furchgott	,	ignarro	and	murad	,	won	the	 no 	 bel 	 	prize	for	medicine	back	in	1998	.
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	the	first	people	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	 th 	 is 	 	new	chemical	 transmit 	 ter 	 	,	nitric	oxide	.
what	nitric	oxide	 do 	 es 	 	is	it	dilates	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	,	so	it	 lower 	 s 	 	your	blood	pressure	.
it	 al 	 so 	 	dilates	the	 cor 	 on 	 ary 	 	 arteri 	 es 	 	,	so	it	 stop 	 s 	 	angina	.
and	what	was	 remark 	 able 	 	about	it	was	in	the	past	when	we	think	of	chemical	 messenger 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	body	,	we	thought	of	 complic 	 ated 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	estrogen	and	insulin	,	or	nerve	 trans 	 mission 	 	.
 ver 	 y 	 	complex	 process 	 es 	 	with	 ver 	 y 	 	complex	 chemical 	 s 	 	that	fit	 in 	 to 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	complex	 receptor 	 s 	 	.
and	here	's	 th 	 is 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	simple	molecule	,	a	nitrogen	and	an	oxygen	that	are	 s 	 tuck 	 	together	,	and	yet	these	are	 huge 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	for	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	our	low	blood	pressure	,	for	neurotransmission	,	for	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	but	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 cardio 	 vascular 	 	health	.
and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	research	,	and	we	found	,	 ver 	 y 	 	excitingly	,	that	the	skin	 produce 	 s 	 	nitric	oxide	.
so	it	's	not	just	in	the	 cardio 	 vascular 	 	system	it	 arise 	 s 	 	.
it	 arise 	 s 	 	in	the	skin	.
well	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	found	that	and	 publish 	 ed 	 	that	,	i	thought	,	well	,	what	's	it	 do 	 ing 	 	?
how	do	you	have	low	blood	pressure	in	your	skin	?
it	's	not	the	heart	.	what	do	you	do	?
so	i	went	off	to	the	 state 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	do	if	they	're	going	to	do	research	,	and	i	 s 	 pent 	 	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	in	pittsburgh	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	pittsburgh	.
and	i	was	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	these	 re 	 ally 	 	complex	 system 	 s 	 	.
we	thought	that	 may 	 be 	 	nitric	oxide	 affect 	 ed 	 	cell	death	,	and	how	 cell 	 s 	 	 surviv 	 e 	 	,	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 resist 	 ance 	 	to	other	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	i	first	off	 start 	 ed 	 	work	in	cell	culture	,	growing	 cell 	 s 	 	,	and	then	i	was	using	 knock 	 out 	 	mouse	 model 	 s 	 	--	 mic 	 e 	 	that	could	n't	make	the	gene	.
we	 work 	 ed 	 	out	a	 mechan 	 ism 	 	,	which	--	no	was	 help 	 ing 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	 surviv 	 e 	 	.
and	i	then	 move 	 d 	 	back	to	edinburgh	.
and	in	edinburgh	,	the	 experiment 	 al 	 	animal	we	use	is	the	medical	student	.
it	's	a	species	close	to	human	,	with	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 advantage 	 s 	 	over	 mic 	 e 	 	:	they	're	free	,	you	do	n't	 s 	 have 	 	them	,	they	feed	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	and	 no 	 body 	 	pickets	your	 off 	 ice 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	 s 	 ave 	 	the	lab	medical	student	.	``	so	they	're	 re 	 ally 	 	an	ideal	model	.
but	what	we	found	was	that	we	could	n't	 re 	 produce 	 	in	man	the	data	we	had	 show 	 n 	 	in	 mic 	 e 	 	.
it	 seem 	 ed 	 	we	could	n't	turn	off	the	production	of	nitric	oxide	in	the	skin	of	 human 	 s 	 	.
we	put	on	 cream 	 s 	 	that	 block 	 ed 	 	the	enzyme	that	made	it	,	we	 inject 	 ed 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.	we	could	n't	turn	off	the	nitric	oxide	.
and	the	reason	for	 th 	 is 	 	,	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	,	after	two	or	three	 year 	 s 	 	'	work	,	was	that	in	the	skin	we	have	huge	 store 	 s 	 	not	of	nitric	oxide	,	 be 	 cause 	 	nitric	oxide	is	a	gas	,	and	it	's	released	--	--	and	in	a	few	 second 	 s 	 	it	's	away	,	but	it	can	be	 turn 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	these	 form 	 s 	 	of	nitric	oxide	--	 nitr 	 ate 	 	,	no	3	;	nitrite	,	no	2	;	nitrosothiols	.
and	these	are	more	 s 	 table 	 	,	and	your	skin	 ha 	 s 	 	got	 re 	 ally 	 	large	 store 	 s 	 	of	no	.
and	we	then	thought	to	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	with	 t 	 hose 	 	big	 store 	 s 	 	,	i	wonder	if	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	might	activate	 t 	 hose 	 	 store 	 s 	 	and	 re 	 lease 	 	them	from	the	skin	,	where	the	 store 	 s 	 	are	about	10	 time 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	big	 a 	 s 	 	what	's	in	the	 circul 	 ation 	 	.
could	the	 s 	 un 	 	activate	 t 	 hose 	 	 store 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 circul 	 ation 	 	,	and	there	in	the	 circul 	 ation 	 	do	 it 	 s 	 	good	 thing 	 s 	 	for	your	 cardio 	 vascular 	 	system	?
well	,	i	'm	an	 experiment 	 al 	 	dermatologist	,	so	what	we	did	was	we	thought	we	'd	have	to	 ex 	 pose 	 	our	 experiment 	 al 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	to	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	.
and	so	what	we	did	was	we	took	a	bunch	of	 volunteer 	 s 	 	and	we	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	them	to	 ultra 	 viol 	 et 	 	light	.
so	these	are	kind	of	sunlamps	.
now	,	what	we	 we 	 re 	 	 care 	 ful 	 	to	do	was	,	 vita 	 min 	 	d	is	made	by	 ultra 	 viol 	 et 	 	b	 ray 	 s 	 	and	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 separat 	 e 	 	our	story	from	the	 vita 	 min 	 	d	story	.
so	we	used	 ultra 	 viol 	 et 	 	a	,	which	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	 vita 	 min 	 	d	.
when	we	put	people	under	a	lamp	for	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	about	30	 minute 	 s 	 	of	 s 	 un 	 shine 	 	in	summer	in	edinburgh	,	what	we	 produce 	 d 	 	was	,	we	 produce 	 d 	 	a	rise	in	 circul 	 ating 	 	nitric	oxide	.
so	we	put	 patient 	 s 	 	with	these	 subject 	 s 	 	under	the	uv	,	and	 the 	 ir 	 	no	 level 	 s 	 	do	go	up	,	and	 the 	 ir 	 	blood	pressure	 go 	 es 	 	down	.
not	by	much	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	individual	level	,	but	 en 	 ough 	 	at	a	population	level	to	shift	the	rates	of	heart	disease	in	a	whole	population	.
and	when	we	 s 	 hone 	 	uv	at	them	,	or	when	we	 warm 	 ed 	 	them	up	to	the	same	level	 a 	 s 	 	the	 lamp 	 s 	 	,	but	did	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	let	the	 ray 	 s 	 	hit	the	skin	,	 th 	 is 	 	did	n't	happen	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	a	feature	of	 ultra 	 viol 	 et 	 	 ray 	 s 	 	hitting	the	skin	.
now	,	we	're	still	 collect 	 ing 	 	data	.
a	few	good	 thing 	 s 	 	here	:	 th 	 is 	 	 appear 	 ed 	 	to	be	more	 mark 	 ed 	 	in	 old 	 er 	 	people	.
i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	how	much	.
one	of	the	 subject 	 s 	 	here	was	my	mother	-	in	-	law	,	and	 clear 	 ly 	 	i	do	not	know	her	age	.
but	 certain 	 ly 	 	in	people	 old 	 er 	 	than	my	wife	,	 th 	 is 	 	 appear 	 s 	 	to	be	a	more	 mark 	 ed 	 	effect	.
and	the	other	thing	i	should	 ment 	 ion 	 	was	there	was	no	change	in	 vita 	 min 	 	d	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 separat 	 e 	 	from	 vita 	 min 	 	d	.
so	 vita 	 min 	 	d	is	good	for	you	--	it	 stop 	 s 	 	rickets	,	it	 prevent 	 s 	 	 calc 	 ium 	 	 metabol 	 ism 	 	,	 import 	 ant 	 	stuff	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 separat 	 e 	 	 mechan 	 ism 	 	from	 vita 	 min 	 	d	.
now	,	one	of	the	 problem 	 s 	 	with	looking	at	blood	pressure	is	your	body	 do 	 es 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	it	can	to	keep	your	blood	pressure	at	the	same	place	.
if	your	leg	is	 chop 	 ped 	 	off	and	you	lose	blood	,	your	body	will	 clam 	 p 	 	down	,	 in 	 crease 	 	the	heart	rate	,	do	 every 	 thing 	 	it	can	to	keep	your	blood	pressure	up	.
that	is	an	 absolute 	 ly 	 	fundamental	 physiologic 	 al 	 	principle	.
so	what	we	've	next	 d 	 one 	 	is	we	've	 move 	 d 	 	on	to	looking	at	blood	vessel	dilatation	.
so	we	've	 measur 	 ed 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	 aga 	 in 	 	,	notice	no	tail	and	 hair 	 less 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	medical	student	.
in	the	arm	,	you	can	measure	blood	flow	in	the	arm	by	how	much	it	 s 	 well 	 s 	 	up	 a 	 s 	 	some	blood	 flow 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	it	.
and	what	we	've	 show 	 n 	 	is	that	 do 	 ing 	 	a	 s 	 ham 	 	irradiation	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	thick	line	here	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	 shin 	 ing 	 	uv	on	the	arm	so	it	 warm 	 s 	 	up	but	 keep 	 ing 	 	it	 cover 	 ed 	 	so	the	 ray 	 s 	 	do	n't	hit	the	skin	.
there	is	no	change	in	blood	flow	,	in	dilatation	of	the	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	.
but	the	active	irradiation	,	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	uv	and	for	an	hour	after	it	,	there	is	 dil 	 ation 	 	of	the	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 mechan 	 ism 	 	by	which	you	lower	blood	pressure	,	by	which	you	dilate	the	 cor 	 on 	 ary 	 	 arteri 	 es 	 	 al 	 so 	 	,	to	let	the	blood	be	 suppli 	 ed 	 	with	the	heart	.
so	here	,	further	data	that	 ultra 	 viol 	 et 	 	--	that	's	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	--	 ha 	 s 	 	 benefit 	 s 	 	on	the	blood	flow	and	the	 cardio 	 vascular 	 	system	.
so	we	thought	we	'd	just	kind	of	model	--	different	 amount 	 s 	 	of	uv	hit	different	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	earth	at	different	 time 	 s 	 	of	year	,	so	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	work	out	 t 	 hose 	 	 store 	 s 	 	of	nitric	oxide	--	the	 nitr 	 ates 	 	,	nitrites	,	nitrosothiols	in	the	skin	--	cleave	to	 re 	 lease 	 	no	.
different	 wave 	 length 	 s 	 	of	light	have	different	 activ 	 ities 	 	of	 do 	 ing 	 	that	.
so	you	can	look	at	the	 wave 	 length 	 s 	 	of	light	that	do	that	.
and	you	can	look	--	so	,	if	you	live	on	the	 equ 	 ator 	 	,	the	 s 	 un 	 	 come 	 s 	 	straight	 over 	 head 	 	,	it	 come 	 s 	 	through	a	 ver 	 y 	 	thin	bit	of	atmosphere	.
in	winter	or	summer	,	it	's	the	same	amount	of	light	.
if	you	live	up	here	,	in	summer	the	 s 	 un 	 	is	coming	 fair 	 ly 	 	 direct 	 ly 	 	down	,	but	in	winter	it	's	coming	through	a	huge	amount	of	atmosphere	,	and	much	of	the	 ultra 	 viol 	 et 	 	is	weeded	out	,	and	the	range	of	 wave 	 length 	 s 	 	that	hit	the	earth	are	different	from	summer	to	winter	.
so	what	you	can	do	is	you	can	 multi 	 ply 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	data	by	the	no	that	's	released	and	you	can	 calcul 	 ate 	 	how	much	nitric	oxide	would	be	released	from	the	skin	 in 	 to 	 	the	 circul 	 ation 	 	.
now	,	if	you	're	on	the	 equ 	 ator 	 	here	--	that	's	these	two	lines	here	,	the	red	line	and	the	 pur 	 ple 	 	line	--	the	amount	of	nitric	oxide	that	's	released	is	the	area	under	the	 curv 	 e 	 	,	it	's	the	area	in	 th 	 is 	 	space	here	.
so	if	you	're	on	the	 equ 	 ator 	 	,	december	or	june	,	you	've	got	 masse 	 s 	 	of	no	 be 	 ing 	 	released	from	the	skin	.
so	ventura	is	in	southern	california	.
in	summer	,	you	might	 a 	 s 	 	well	be	at	the	 equ 	 ator 	 	.
it	's	great	.	 lot 	 s 	 	of	no	is	released	.
ventura	mid	-	winter	,	well	,	there	's	still	a	 de 	 cent 	 	amount	.
edinburgh	in	summer	,	the	area	 be 	 neath 	 	the	 curv 	 e 	 	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	,	but	edinburgh	in	winter	,	the	amount	of	no	that	can	be	released	is	next	to	 noth 	 ing 	 	,	 tin 	 y 	 	 amount 	 s 	 	.
so	what	do	we	think	?
we	're	still	 work 	 ing 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	story	,	we	're	still	 develop 	 ing 	 	it	,	we	're	still	 expand 	 ing 	 	it	.
we	think	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
we	think	it	 prob 	 ably 	 	 account 	 s 	 	for	a	lot	of	the	north	-	south	health	divide	 with 	 in 	 	britain	,	it	's	of	relevance	to	us	.
we	think	that	the	skin	--	well	,	we	know	that	the	skin	 ha 	 s 	 	got	 ver 	 y 	 	large	 store 	 s 	 	of	nitric	oxide	 a 	 s 	 	these	 vari 	 ous 	 	other	 form 	 s 	 	.
we	suspect	a	lot	of	these	come	from	diet	,	green	 leaf 	 y 	 	 veget 	 able 	 s 	 	,	beetroot	,	lettuce	 ha 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	these	nitric	 oxide 	 s 	 	that	we	think	go	to	the	skin	.
we	think	they	're	then	 store 	 d 	 	in	the	skin	,	and	we	think	the	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	 re 	 lease 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	where	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 general 	 ly 	 	 benefici 	 al 	 	 effect 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 on 	 going 	 	work	,	but	 der 	 ma 	 to 	 logists 	 	--	i	mean	,	i	'm	a	dermatologist	.
my	day	job	is	 say 	 ing 	 	to	people	,	``	you	've	got	skin	cancer	,	it	's	 caus 	 ed 	 	by	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	,	do	n't	go	in	the	sun.	``	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	think	a	far	more	 import 	 ant 	 	 mess 	 age 	 	is	that	there	are	 benefit 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 risk 	 s 	 	to	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	is	the	major	alterable	risk	factor	for	skin	cancer	,	but	 death 	 s 	 	from	heart	disease	are	a	hundred	 time 	 s 	 	 high 	 er 	 	than	 death 	 s 	 	from	skin	cancer	.
and	i	think	that	we	need	to	be	more	aware	of	,	and	we	need	to	find	the	risk	-	benefit	ratio	.
how	much	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	is	safe	,	and	how	can	we	 fine 	 s 	 s 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	best	for	our	general	health	?
