hi	.	so	i	'd	like	to	talk	a	little	bit	about	the	people	who	make	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	use	every	day	:	our	 shoe 	 s 	 	,	our	 hand 	 bag 	 s 	 	,	our	 computer 	 s 	 	and	cell	 phone 	 s 	 	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	conversation	that	often	 call 	 s 	 	up	a	lot	of	guilt	.
imagine	the	 teen 	 age 	 	farm	girl	who	 make 	 s 	 	less	than	a	dollar	an	hour	 stitch 	 ing 	 	your	running	 shoe 	 s 	 	,	or	the	young	chinese	man	who	 jump 	 s 	 	off	a	 roof 	 top 	 	after	 work 	 ing 	 	 over 	 time 	 	 assem 	 bling 	 	your	ipad	.
we	,	the	 benefici 	 aries 	 	of	 global 	 ization 	 	,	seem	to	exploit	these	 victim 	 s 	 	with	every	purchase	we	make	,	and	the	 in 	 justice 	 	 feel 	 s 	 	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	in	the	 product 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
after	all	,	what	's	wrong	with	a	world	in	which	a	 work 	 er 	 	on	an	iphone	 assem 	 bly 	 	line	ca	n't	even	afford	to	buy	one	?
it	's	taken	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	that	chinese	 factor 	 ies 	 	are	 oppress 	 ive 	 	,	and	that	it	's	our	 desir 	 e 	 	for	cheap	 good 	 s 	 	that	 make 	 s 	 	them	so	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	simple	narrative	equating	western	demand	and	chinese	 suffer 	 ing 	 	is	 appeal 	 ing 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	at	a	time	when	 man 	 y 	 	of	us	 al 	 ready 	 	feel	 guilt 	 y 	 	about	our	impact	on	the	world	,	but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 in 	 accurate 	 	and	 dis 	 respect 	 ful 	 	.
we	must	be	 peculiar 	 ly 	 	self	-	 obsess 	 ed 	 	to	imagine	that	we	have	the	power	to	drive	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	people	on	the	other	side	of	the	world	to	 migr 	 ate 	 	and	suffer	in	 s 	 uch 	 	 terr 	 ible 	 	ways	.
in	fact	,	 chin 	 a 	 	 make 	 s 	 	 good 	 s 	 	for	 market 	 s 	 	all	over	the	world	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	own	,	 thank 	 s 	 	to	a	combination	of	 factor 	 s 	 	:	 it 	 s 	 	low	 cost 	 s 	 	,	 it 	 s 	 	large	and	educated	 work 	 force 	 	,	and	a	 flex 	 ible 	 	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	system	that	 respond 	 s 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	to	market	 demand 	 s 	 	.
by	 focus 	 ing 	 	so	much	on	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	our	 gadget 	 s 	 	,	we	have	 render 	 ed 	 	the	 individual 	 s 	 	on	the	other	end	 in 	 to 	 	 in 	 vis 	 ibility 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 tin 	 y 	 	and	 inter 	 change 	 able 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 part 	 s 	 	of	a	mobile	phone	.
chinese	 work 	 ers 	 	are	not	 force 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 factor 	 ies 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	our	 in 	 sati 	 able 	 	 desir 	 e 	 	for	ipods	.
they	 choos 	 e 	 	to	 leav 	 e 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 home 	 s 	 	in	order	to	earn	money	,	to	learn	new	 skill 	 s 	 	,	and	to	see	the	world	.
in	the	 on 	 going 	 	debate	about	 global 	 ization 	 	,	what	's	 be 	 en 	 	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	is	the	 voice 	 s 	 	of	the	 work 	 ers 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
here	are	a	few	.
bao	yongxiu	:	``	my	mother	 tell 	 s 	 	me	to	come	home	and	get	married	,	but	if	i	marry	now	,	before	i	have	fully	 develop 	 ed 	 	 my 	 self 	 	,	i	can	 on 	 ly 	 	marry	an	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 work 	 er 	 	,	so	i	'm	not	in	a	rush	.	``
chen	ying	:	``	when	i	went	home	for	the	new	year	,	 every 	 one 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	i	had	 change 	 d 	 	.	they	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	,	what	did	you	do	that	you	have	 change 	 d 	 	so	much	?
i	told	them	that	i	 stud 	 ied 	 	and	 work 	 ed 	 	hard	.	if	you	tell	them	more	,	they	wo	n't	understand	 any 	 way 	 	.	``
wu	chunming	:	``	even	if	i	make	a	lot	of	money	,	it	wo	n't	satisfy	me	.
just	to	make	money	is	not	 en 	 ough 	 	meaning	in	life	.	``
xiao	jin	:	``	now	,	after	i	get	off	work	,	i	 stud 	 y 	 	english	,	 be 	 cause 	 	in	the	future	,	our	 custom 	 ers 	 	wo	n't	be	 on 	 ly 	 	chinese	,	so	we	must	learn	more	 language 	 s 	 	.	``
all	of	these	 speaker 	 s 	 	,	by	the	way	,	are	young	women	,	18	or	19	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
so	i	 s 	 pent 	 	two	 year 	 s 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	to	know	 assem 	 bly 	 	line	 work 	 ers 	 	like	these	in	the	south	 chin 	 a 	 	 factor 	 y 	 	city	 call 	 ed 	 	dongguan	.
certain	 subject 	 s 	 	came	up	over	and	over	:	how	much	money	they	made	,	what	kind	of	husband	they	 hop 	 ed 	 	to	marry	,	 whet 	 her 	 	they	should	jump	to	 an 	 other 	 	 factor 	 y 	 	or	stay	where	they	 we 	 re 	 	.
other	 subject 	 s 	 	came	up	 al 	 most 	 	never	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	living	 condition 	 s 	 	that	to	me	 look 	 ed 	 	close	to	 pri 	 son 	 	life	:	10	or	15	 work 	 ers 	 	in	one	room	,	50	people	sharing	a	single	 bath 	 room 	 	,	 day 	 s 	 	and	 night 	 s 	 	 rul 	 ed 	 	by	the	 factor 	 y 	 	clock	.
 every 	 one 	 	they	 k 	 new 	 	lived	in	similar	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	,	and	it	was	still	better	than	the	 dorm 	 it 	 ories 	 	and	 home 	 s 	 	of	 r 	 ural 	 	 chin 	 a 	 	.
the	 work 	 ers 	 	 rare 	 ly 	 	spoke	about	the	 product 	 s 	 	they	made	,	and	they	often	had	great	 difficult 	 y 	 	 explain 	 ing 	 	what	 exact 	 ly 	 	they	did	.
when	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	lu	qingmin	,	the	young	woman	i	got	to	know	best	,	what	 exact 	 ly 	 	she	did	on	the	 factor 	 y 	 	floor	,	she	 s 	 aid 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	to	me	in	chinese	that	 sound 	 ed 	 	like	``	qiu	xi	.	``
 on 	 ly 	 	much	 lat 	 er 	 	did	i	 real 	 ize 	 	that	she	had	 be 	 en 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	``	qc	,	``	or	quality	control	.
she	could	n't	even	tell	me	what	she	did	on	the	 factor 	 y 	 	floor	.
all	she	could	do	was	 par 	 rot 	 	a	garbled	 abbrevi 	 ation 	 	in	a	language	she	did	n't	even	understand	.
karl	marx	saw	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	of	 capital 	 ism 	 	,	the	 alien 	 ation 	 	of	the	 work 	 er 	 	from	the	product	of	his	labor	.
 un 	 like 	 	,	say	,	a	 tradition 	 al 	 	maker	of	 shoe 	 s 	 	or	 cabinet 	 s 	 	,	the	 work 	 er 	 	in	an	industrial	 factor 	 y 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	no	control	,	no	pleasure	,	and	no	true	satisfaction	or	 understand 	 ing 	 	in	her	own	work	.
but	like	so	 man 	 y 	 	 the 	 ories 	 	that	marx	 arriv 	 ed 	 	at	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	the	 read 	 ing 	 	room	of	the	british	museum	,	he	got	 th 	 is 	 	one	wrong	.
just	 be 	 cause 	 	a	person	 s 	 pend 	 s 	 	her	time	making	a	piece	of	 some 	 thing 	 	 do 	 es 	 	not	mean	that	she	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	that	,	a	piece	of	 some 	 thing 	 	.
what	she	 do 	 es 	 	with	the	money	she	 earn 	 s 	 	,	what	she	 learn 	 s 	 	in	that	place	,	and	how	it	 change 	 s 	 	her	,	these	are	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	matter	.
what	a	 factor 	 y 	 	 make 	 s 	 	is	never	the	point	,	and	the	 work 	 ers 	 	could	not	care	less	who	 buy 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 product 	 s 	 	.
 journalist 	 ic 	 	 cover 	 age 	 	of	chinese	 factor 	 ies 	 	,	on	the	other	hand	,	 play 	 s 	 	up	 th 	 is 	 	relationship	between	the	 work 	 ers 	 	and	the	 product 	 s 	 	they	make	.
 man 	 y 	 	 article 	 s 	 	 calcul 	 ate 	 	:	how	long	would	it	take	for	 th 	 is 	 	 work 	 er 	 	to	work	in	order	to	earn	 en 	 ough 	 	money	to	buy	what	he	's	making	?
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	an	entry	-	level	-	line	 assem 	 bly 	 	line	 work 	 er 	 	in	 chin 	 a 	 	in	an	iphone	plant	would	have	to	shell	out	two	and	a	half	 month 	 s 	 	'	 wage 	 s 	 	for	an	iphone	.

for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	i	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	wrote	an	article	in	the	new	yorker	magazine	,	but	i	ca	n't	afford	to	buy	an	ad	in	it	.
but	,	who	 care 	 s 	 	?	i	do	n't	want	an	ad	in	the	new	yorker	,	and	most	of	these	 work 	 ers 	 	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	want	iphones	.
 the 	 ir 	 	 calcul 	 ations 	 	are	different	.
how	long	should	i	stay	in	 th 	 is 	 	 factor 	 y 	 	?
how	much	money	can	i	 s 	 ave 	 	?
how	much	will	it	take	to	buy	an	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	or	a	car	,	to	get	married	,	or	to	put	my	child	through	school	?
the	 work 	 ers 	 	i	got	to	know	had	a	 cur 	 iously 	 	abstract	relationship	with	the	product	of	 the 	 ir 	 	labor	.
about	a	year	after	i	met	lu	qingmin	,	or	min	,	she	 invit 	 ed 	 	me	home	to	her	family	village	for	the	chinese	new	year	.
on	the	train	home	,	she	 g 	 ave 	 	me	a	present	:	a	coach	brand	change	 pur 	 s 	 e 	 	with	 brow 	 n 	 	leather	trim	.
i	 thank 	 ed 	 	her	,	 assum 	 ing 	 	it	was	fake	,	like	 al 	 most 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	else	for	sale	in	dongguan	.
after	we	got	home	,	min	 g 	 ave 	 	her	mother	 an 	 other 	 	present	:	a	pink	dooney	&	bourke	 hand 	 bag 	 	,	and	a	few	 night 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	her	sister	was	 show 	 ing 	 	off	a	maroon	lesportsac	shoulder	bag	.
 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	it	was	 dawn 	 ing 	 	on	me	that	these	 hand 	 bag 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	made	by	 the 	 ir 	 	 factor 	 y 	 	,	and	every	single	one	of	them	was	authentic	.
min	's	sister	 s 	 aid 	 	to	her	 parent 	 s 	 	,	``	in	america	,	 th 	 is 	 	bag	 sell 	 s 	 	for	320	 dollar 	 s 	 	.	``
her	 parent 	 s 	 	,	who	are	both	 farm 	 ers 	 	,	 look 	 ed 	 	on	,	 speech 	 less 	 	.
``	and	that	's	not	all	--	coach	is	coming	out	with	a	new	line	,	2191	,	``	she	 s 	 aid 	 	.	``	one	bag	will	sell	for	6,000	.	``
she	 pause 	 d 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	do	n't	know	if	that	's	6,000	yuan	or	6,000	american	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	but	 any 	 way 	 	,	it	's	6,000	.	``
min	's	sister	's	boyfriend	,	who	had	 travel 	 ed 	 	home	with	her	for	the	new	year	,	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	look	like	it	's	worth	that	much	.	``
min	's	sister	 turn 	 ed 	 	to	him	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	some	people	 actual 	 ly 	 	understand	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.	you	do	n't	understand	shit	.	``
in	min	's	world	,	the	coach	 bag 	 s 	 	had	a	 cur 	 ious 	 	 curr 	 ency 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 exact 	 ly 	 	 worth 	 less 	 	,	but	they	 we 	 re 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	close	to	the	actual	value	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 al 	 most 	 	no	one	they	 k 	 new 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	buy	one	,	or	 k 	 new 	 	how	much	it	was	worth	.
once	,	when	min	's	 old 	 er 	 	sister	's	friend	got	married	,	she	 br 	 ought 	 	a	 hand 	 bag 	 	 a 	 long 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 wed 	 d 	 ing 	 	present	.
 an 	 other 	 	time	,	after	min	had	 al 	 ready 	 	left	the	 hand 	 bag 	 	 factor 	 y 	 	,	her	 young 	 er 	 	sister	came	to	visit	,	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	two	coach	signature	 hand 	 bag 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 gift 	 s 	 	.
i	 look 	 ed 	 	in	the	zippered	pocket	of	one	,	and	i	found	a	 print 	 ed 	 	card	in	english	,	which	read	,	``	an	american	classic	.
in	1941	,	the	 burn 	 ish 	 ed 	 	patina	of	an	all	-	american	 base 	 ball 	 	glove	inspired	the	founder	of	coach	to	create	a	new	 collect 	 ion 	 	of	 hand 	 bag 	 s 	 	from	the	same	luxuriously	soft	 glove 	 d 	 	-	hand	leather	.

they	 we 	 re 	 	fresh	,	functional	,	and	women	 every 	 where 	 
 ador 	 ed 	 	them	.	a	new	american	classic	was	born	.	``
i	wonder	what	karl	marx	would	have	made	of	min	and	her	 sister 	 s 	 	.
 the 	 ir 	 	relationship	with	the	product	of	 the 	 ir 	 	labor	was	more	 complic 	 ated 	 	,	surprising	and	funny	than	he	could	have	 imagin 	 ed 	 	.
and	yet	,	his	view	of	the	world	 persist 	 s 	 	,	and	our	 tend 	 ency 	 	to	see	the	 work 	 ers 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 face 	 less 	 	 masse 	 s 	 	,	to	imagine	that	we	can	know	what	they	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	.
the	first	time	i	met	min	,	she	had	just	 turn 	 ed 	 	18	and	quit	her	first	job	on	the	 assem 	 bly 	 	line	of	an	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	 factor 	 y 	 	.
over	the	next	two	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	 watch 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	she	 s 	 witch 	 ed 	 	 job 	 s 	 	five	 time 	 s 	 	,	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 land 	 ing 	 	a	 luc 	 rative 	 	post	in	the	 pur 	 chasing 	 	 depart 	 ment 	 	of	a	 hard 	 ware 	 	 factor 	 y 	 	.
 lat 	 er 	 	,	she	married	a	fellow	migrant	 work 	 er 	 	,	 move 	 d 	 	with	him	to	his	village	,	 g 	 ave 	 	birth	to	two	 daughter 	 s 	 	,	and	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	money	to	buy	a	 second 	 hand 	 	buick	for	 her 	 self 	 	and	an	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	for	her	 parent 	 s 	 	.

in	a	 re 	 cent 	 	email	to	me	,	she	 explain 	 ed 	 	,	``	a	person	should	have	some	 ambit 	 ion 	 	while	she	is	young	so	that	in	old	age	she	can	look	back	on	her	life	and	feel	that	it	was	not	lived	to	no	purpose	.	``
 a 	 cross 	 	 chin 	 a 	 	,	there	are	150	million	 work 	 ers 	 	like	her	,	one	third	of	them	women	,	who	have	left	 the 	 ir 	 	 village 	 s 	 	to	work	in	the	 factor 	 ies 	 	,	the	 hotel 	 s 	 	,	the	 restaurant 	 s 	 	and	the	construction	 s 	 ites 	 	of	the	big	cities	.
together	,	they	make	up	the	largest	 migr 	 ation 	 	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	and	it	is	 global 	 ization 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	chain	that	 begin 	 s 	 	in	a	chinese	 farm 	 ing 	 	village	and	 end 	 s 	 	with	iphones	in	our	 pocket 	 s 	 	and	nikes	on	our	feet	and	coach	 hand 	 bag 	 s 	 	on	our	 arm 	 s 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	the	way	these	 million 	 s 	 	of	people	work	and	marry	and	live	and	think	.
 ver 	 y 	 	few	of	them	would	want	to	go	back	to	the	way	 thing 	 s 	 	used	to	be	.
when	i	first	went	to	dongguan	,	i	 worri 	 ed 	 	that	it	would	be	 depress 	 ing 	 	to	 s 	 pend 	 	so	much	time	with	 work 	 ers 	 	.

 in 	 stead 	 	,	i	found	young	women	who	 we 	 re 	 	smart	and	funny	and	brave	and	 gen 	 er 	 ous 	 	.
by	 open 	 ing 	 	up	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	to	me	,	they	taught	me	so	much	about	 factor 	 ies 	 	and	about	 chin 	 a 	 	and	about	how	to	live	in	the	world	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	coach	 pur 	 s 	 e 	 	that	min	 g 	 ave 	 	me	on	the	train	home	to	visit	her	family	.

when	you	talk	to	 work 	 ers 	 	,	that	's	what	they	want	.
they	do	not	say	,	``	i	want	better	hot	water	in	the	 shower 	 s 	 	.
i	want	a	 nic 	 er 	 	room	.	i	want	a	tv	set	.	``
i	mean	,	it	would	be	nice	to	have	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	but	that	's	not	why	they	're	in	the	city	,	and	that	's	not	what	they	care	about	.
ca	:	was	there	a	sense	from	them	of	a	narrative	that	 thing 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	kind	of	tough	and	bad	,	or	was	there	a	narrative	of	some	kind	of	level	of	growth	,	that	 thing 	 s 	 	over	time	 we 	 re 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	better	?
lc	:	oh	 definite 	 ly 	 	,	 definite 	 ly 	 	.	i	mean	,	you	know	,	it	was	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 s 	 pent 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	two	 year 	 s 	 	 hang 	 ing 	 	out	in	 th 	 is 	 	city	,	dongguan	,	and	over	that	time	,	you	could	see	immense	change	in	every	person	's	life	:	 up 	 ward 	 	,	 down 	 ward 	 	,	 side 	 ways 	 	,	but	 general 	 ly 	 	 up 	 ward 	 	.
if	you	 s 	 pend 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	time	,	it	's	 up 	 ward 	 	,	and	i	met	people	who	had	 move 	 d 	 	to	the	city	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	who	are	now	 bas 	 ically 	 	urban	middle	class	people	,	so	the	 tra 	 ject 	 ory 	 	is	 definite 	 ly 	 	 up 	 ward 	 	.
it	's	just	hard	to	see	when	you	're	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 suck 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	city	.	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	 every 	 one 	 	's	poor	and	desperate	,	but	that	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	how	it	is	.
 certain 	 ly 	 	,	the	 factor 	 y 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	tough	,	and	it	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	you	or	i	would	want	to	do	,	but	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	where	they	're	coming	from	is	much	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	and	where	they	're	going	is	 hope 	 fully 	 	much	better	,	and	i	just	 want 	 ed 	 	to	give	that	 con 	 text 	 	of	what	's	going	on	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 mind 	 s 	 	,	not	what	 necess 	 arily 	 	is	going	on	in	 your 	 s 	 	.
ca	:	 thank 	 s 	 	so	much	for	your	talk	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
