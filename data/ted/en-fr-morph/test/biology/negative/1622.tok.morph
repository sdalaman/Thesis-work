i	'm	a	 design 	 er 	 	and	an	 educ 	 ator 	 	.
i	'm	a	 multi 	 task 	 ing 	 	person	,	and	i	push	my	 student 	 s 	 	to	fly	through	a	 ver 	 y 	 	creative	,	 multi 	 task 	 ing 	 	design	process	.
but	how	efficient	is	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 multi 	 task 	 ing 	 	?
let	's	consider	for	a	while	the	option	of	monotasking	.
a	couple	of	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
look	at	that	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	my	 multi 	 task 	 ing 	 	activity	result	.
so	 try 	 ing 	 	to	cook	,	 answer 	 ing 	 	the	phone	,	writing	sms	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	 upload 	 ing 	 	some	 picture 	 s 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	awesome	barbecue	.
so	 some 	 one 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	us	the	story	about	supertaskers	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	two	percent	of	people	who	are	able	to	control	 multi 	 task 	 ing 	 	environment	.
but	what	about	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	and	what	about	our	 re 	 ality 	 	?
when	's	the	last	time	you	 re 	 ally 	 	 enjoy 	 ed 	 	just	the	voice	of	your	friend	?
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	project	i	'm	 work 	 ing 	 	on	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	front	 cover 	 s 	 	to	downgrade	our	super	,	hyper	--	to	downgrade	our	super	,	hyper	-	mobile	 phone 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 es 	 s 	 ence 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	function	.
 an 	 other 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	:	have	you	ever	 be 	 en 	 	to	venice	?
how	 beaut 	 iful 	 	it	is	to	lose	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	these	little	 street 	 s 	 	on	the	 is 	 land 	 	.
but	our	 multi 	 task 	 ing 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	different	,	and	full	of	 ton 	 s 	 	of	information	.
so	what	about	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	to	 re 	 discover 	 	our	sense	of	adventure	?
i	know	that	it	could	sound	 pre 	 tty 	 	weird	to	speak	about	mono	when	the	number	of	 possibil 	 ities 	 	is	so	huge	,	but	i	push	you	to	consider	the	option	of	 focus 	 ing 	 	on	just	one	task	,	or	 may 	 be 	 	 turn 	 ing 	 	your	digital	 sense 	 s 	 	 total 	 ly 	 	off	.
so	 now 	 a 	 day 	 s 	 	,	 every 	 one 	 	could	produce	his	mono	product	.
why	not	?	so	find	your	monotask	spot	 with 	 in 	 	the	 multi 	 task 	 ing 	 	world	.
thank	you	.
