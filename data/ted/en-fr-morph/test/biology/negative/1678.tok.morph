what	is	going	to	be	the	future	of	 learn 	 ing 	 	?
i	do	have	a	plan	,	but	in	order	for	me	to	tell	you	what	that	plan	is	,	i	need	to	tell	you	a	little	story	,	which	kind	of	 set 	 s 	 	the	stage	.
i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	look	at	where	did	the	kind	of	 learn 	 ing 	 	we	do	in	 school 	 s 	 	,	where	did	it	come	from	?
and	you	can	look	far	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	past	,	but	if	you	look	at	present	-	day	 school 	 ing 	 	the	way	it	is	,	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	easy	to	figure	out	where	it	came	from	.
it	came	from	about	300	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	it	came	from	the	last	and	the	 big 	 gest 	 	of	the	 empire 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	.	[	``	the	british	empire	``	]	imagine	 try 	 ing 	 	to	run	the	show	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	run	the	entire	planet	,	 with 	 out 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	 tele 	 phone 	 s 	 	,	with	data	 hand 	 written 	 	on	 piece 	 s 	 	of	paper	,	and	 travel 	 ing 	 	by	 ship 	 s 	 	.
but	the	victorians	 actual 	 ly 	 	did	it	.
what	they	did	was	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
they	 create 	 d 	 	a	global	computer	made	up	of	people	.
it	's	still	with	us	 to 	 day 	 	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 bureaucrat 	 ic 	 	 administr 	 ative 	 	machine	.
in	order	to	have	that	machine	running	,	you	need	 lot 	 s 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	people	.
they	made	 an 	 other 	 	machine	to	produce	 t 	 hose 	 	people	:	the	school	.
the	 school 	 s 	 	would	produce	the	people	who	would	then	 be 	 come 	 	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	 bureaucrat 	 ic 	 	 administr 	 ative 	 	machine	.
they	must	be	 ident 	 ical 	 	to	each	other	.
they	must	know	three	 thing 	 s 	 	:	they	must	have	good	 hand 	 writing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	data	is	 hand 	 written 	 	;	they	must	be	able	to	read	;	and	they	must	be	able	to	do	 multi 	 plic 	 ation 	 	,	division	,	 add 	 ition 	 	and	 subtract 	 ion 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	head	.
they	must	be	so	 ident 	 ical 	 	that	you	could	pick	one	up	from	new	zealand	and	ship	them	to	canada	and	he	would	be	 instant 	 ly 	 	functional	.
the	victorians	 we 	 re 	 	great	 engineer 	 s 	 	.
they	engineered	a	system	that	was	so	 ro 	 bust 	 	that	it	's	still	with	us	 to 	 day 	 	,	 continu 	 ously 	 	producing	 ident 	 ical 	 	people	for	a	machine	that	no	 long 	 er 	 	 exist 	 s 	 	.
the	empire	is	gone	,	so	what	are	we	 do 	 ing 	 	with	that	design	that	 produce 	 s 	 	these	 ident 	 ical 	 	people	,	and	what	are	we	going	to	do	next	if	we	ever	are	going	to	do	 any 	 thing 	 	else	with	it	?
[	``	 school 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	know	them	are	 obsolet 	 e 	 	``	]	so	that	's	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	strong	comment	there	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	 school 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	know	them	now	,	they	're	 obsolet 	 e 	 	.
i	'm	not	 say 	 ing 	 	they	're	broken	.
it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	 fashion 	 able 	 	to	say	that	the	education	system	's	broken	.
it	's	not	broken	.	it	's	 wonder 	 fully 	 	 construct 	 ed 	 	.
it	's	just	that	we	do	n't	need	it	 any 	 more 	 	.	it	's	 out 	 d 	 ated 	 	.
what	are	the	kind	of	 job 	 s 	 	that	we	have	 to 	 day 	 	?
well	,	the	clerks	are	the	 computer 	 s 	 	.
they	're	there	in	 thousand 	 s 	 	in	every	 off 	 ice 	 	.
and	you	have	people	who	guide	 t 	 hose 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	to	do	 the 	 ir 	 	 cleric 	 al 	 	 job 	 s 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	people	do	n't	need	to	be	able	to	write	 beaut 	 i 	 fully 	 	by	hand	.
they	do	n't	need	to	be	able	to	 multi 	 ply 	 	 number 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 head 	 s 	 	.
they	do	need	to	be	able	to	read	.
in	fact	,	they	need	to	be	able	to	read	 discern 	 ing 	 ly 	 	.
well	,	that	's	 to 	 day 	 	,	but	we	do	n't	even	know	what	the	 job 	 s 	 	of	the	future	are	going	to	look	like	.
we	know	that	people	will	work	from	 where 	 ver 	 	they	want	,	 when 	 ever 	 	they	want	,	in	 what 	 ever 	 	way	they	want	.
how	is	present	-	day	 school 	 ing 	 	going	to	 prep 	 are 	 	them	for	that	world	?
well	,	i	 bump 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	whole	thing	 complete 	 ly 	 	by	accident	.
i	used	to	teach	people	how	to	write	computer	 program 	 s 	 	in	new	delhi	,	14	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	right	next	to	where	i	used	to	work	,	there	was	a	 s 	 lum 	 	.
and	i	used	to	think	,	how	on	earth	are	 t 	 hose 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	ever	going	to	learn	to	write	computer	 program 	 s 	 	?
or	should	they	not	?
at	the	same	time	,	we	 al 	 so 	 	had	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 parent 	 s 	 	,	rich	people	,	who	had	 computer 	 s 	 	,	and	who	used	to	tell	me	,	``	you	know	,	my	son	,	i	think	he	's	 gift 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 do 	 es 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	with	 computer 	 s 	 	.

what	did	the	poor	do	wrong	?
i	made	a	hole	in	the	 bound 	 ary 	 	wall	of	the	 s 	 lum 	 	next	to	my	 off 	 ice 	 	,	and	 s 	 tuck 	 	a	computer	 in 	 side 	 	it	just	to	see	what	would	happen	if	i	 g 	 ave 	 	a	computer	to	children	who	never	would	have	one	,	did	n't	know	any	english	,	did	n't	know	what	the	 inter 	 net 	 	was	.
the	children	came	running	in	.
it	was	three	feet	off	the	ground	,	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	is	 th 	 is 	 	?	``	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	,	it	's	,	i	do	n't	know	.	``	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	why	have	you	put	it	there	?	``	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	just	like	that	.	``	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	can	we	touch	it	?	``	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	if	you	wish	to	.	``	and	i	went	away	.
about	eight	 hour 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	we	found	them	 brow 	 s 	 ing 	 	and	 teach 	 ing 	 	each	other	how	to	 brow 	 s 	 e 	 	.
so	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	that	's	 im 	 possible 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	--	how	is	it	possible	?	they	do	n't	know	 any 	 thing 	 	.	``	my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	it	's	a	simple	solution	.

so	what	are	 job 	 s 	 	going	to	be	like	?
well	,	we	know	what	they	're	like	 to 	 day 	 	.
what	's	 learn 	 ing 	 	going	to	be	like	?	we	know	what	it	's	like	 to 	 day 	 	,	children	 pour 	 ing 	 	over	with	 the 	 ir 	 	mobile	 phone 	 s 	 	on	the	one	hand	and	then	 reluct 	 ant 	 ly 	 	going	to	school	to	pick	up	 the 	 ir 	 	 book 	 s 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	other	hand	.
what	will	it	be	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	?
could	it	be	that	we	do	n't	need	to	go	to	school	at	all	?
could	it	be	that	,	at	the	point	in	time	when	you	need	to	know	 some 	 thing 	 	,	you	can	find	out	in	two	 minute 	 s 	 	?
could	it	be	--	a	 deva 	 stat 	 ing 	 	question	,	a	question	that	was	 frame 	 d 	 	for	me	by	nicholas	negroponte	--	could	it	be	that	we	are	 head 	 ing 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	or	 may 	 be 	 	in	a	future	where	 know 	 ing 	 	is	 obsolet 	 e 	 	?
but	that	's	 terr 	 ible 	 	.	we	are	homo	 sapien 	 s 	 	.
 know 	 ing 	 	,	that	's	what	 distinguish 	 es 	 	us	from	the	 ape 	 s 	 	.
but	look	at	it	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
it	took	nature	100	million	 year 	 s 	 	to	make	the	ape	stand	up	and	 be 	 come 	 	homo	 sapien 	 s 	 	.
it	took	us	 on 	 ly 	 	10,000	to	make	 know 	 ing 	 	 obsolet 	 e 	 	.
what	an	 achiev 	 ement 	 	that	is	.
but	we	have	to	integrate	that	 in 	 to 	 	our	own	future	.
 encourag 	 ement 	 	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	the	key	.
if	you	look	at	kuppam	,	if	you	look	at	all	of	the	 experiment 	 s 	 	that	i	did	,	it	was	 simpl 	 y 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	 w 	 ow 	 	,	``	 salut 	 ing 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	.
there	is	evidence	from	 neuro 	 science 	 	.
the	 reptil 	 ian 	 	part	of	our	brain	,	which	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	in	the	center	of	our	brain	,	when	it	's	 threaten 	 ed 	 	,	it	 shut 	 s 	 	down	 every 	 thing 	 	else	,	it	 shut 	 s 	 	down	the	 pre 	 frontal 	 	cortex	,	the	 part 	 s 	 	which	learn	,	it	 shut 	 s 	 	all	of	that	down	.
 punish 	 ment 	 	and	 examination 	 s 	 	are	 s 	 een 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 threat 	 s 	 	.
we	take	our	children	,	we	make	them	shut	 the 	 ir 	 	 brain 	 s 	 	down	,	and	then	we	say	,	``	perform	.	``	why	did	they	create	a	system	like	that	?
 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	 need 	 ed 	 	.
there	was	an	age	in	the	age	of	 empire 	 s 	 	when	you	 need 	 ed 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	people	who	can	 surviv 	 e 	 	under	threat	.
when	you	're	 stand 	 ing 	 	in	a	trench	all	 al 	 one 	 	,	if	you	could	have	 surviv 	 ed 	 	,	you	're	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	you	've	 pass 	 ed 	 	.
if	you	did	n't	,	you	 fail 	 ed 	 	.
but	the	age	of	 empire 	 s 	 	is	gone	.
what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	in	our	age	?
we	need	to	shift	that	balance	back	from	threat	to	pleasure	.
i	came	back	to	england	looking	for	british	 grand 	 mother 	 s 	 	.
i	put	out	 notice 	 s 	 	and	 paper 	 s 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	if	you	are	a	british	 grand 	 mother 	 	,	if	you	have	 broad 	 band 	 	and	a	web	camera	,	can	you	give	me	one	hour	of	your	time	per	week	for	free	?
i	got	200	in	the	first	two	 week 	 s 	 	.
i	know	more	british	 grand 	 mother 	 s 	 	than	 any 	 one 	 	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
they	're	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 grann 	 y 	 	cloud	.
the	 grann 	 y 	 	cloud	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
if	there	's	a	child	in	trouble	,	we	beam	a	gran	.
she	 go 	 es 	 	on	over	skype	and	she	 sort 	 s 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	out	.
i	've	 s 	 een 	 	them	do	it	from	a	village	 call 	 ed 	 	diggles	in	 north 	 western 	 	england	,	deep	 in 	 side 	 	a	village	in	tamil	nadu	,	india	,	6,000	 mile 	 s 	 	away	.
she	 do 	 es 	 	it	with	 on 	 ly 	 	one	age	-	old	 gest 	 ure 	 	.
``	shhh	.	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
watch	 th 	 is 	 	.
 grand 	 mother 	 	:	you	ca	n't	catch	me	.	you	say	it	.
you	ca	n't	catch	me	.
children	:	you	ca	n't	catch	me	.
 grand 	 mother 	 	:	i	'm	the	 ging 	 er 	 bread 	 	man	.	children	:	i	'm	the	 ging 	 er 	 bread 	 	man	.
 grand 	 mother 	 	:	well	 d 	 one 	 	!	 ver 	 y 	 	good	.
sm	:	so	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	here	?
i	think	what	we	need	to	look	at	is	we	need	to	look	at	 learn 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	product	of	 education 	 al 	 	self	-	 organ 	 ization 	 	.
if	you	allow	the	 education 	 al 	 	process	to	self	-	organize	,	then	 learn 	 ing 	 	 emerge 	 s 	 	.
it	's	not	about	making	 learn 	 ing 	 	happen	.	it	's	about	 lett 	 ing 	 	it	happen	.
the	teacher	 set 	 s 	 	the	process	in	motion	and	then	she	 stand 	 s 	 	back	in	awe	and	 watch 	 es 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	.
i	think	that	's	what	all	 th 	 is 	 	is	 point 	 ing 	 	at	.
but	how	will	we	know	?	how	will	we	come	to	know	?
well	,	i	intend	to	build	these	self	-	 organize 	 d 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	 environment 	 s 	 	.
they	are	 bas 	 ically 	 	 broad 	 band 	 	,	 collabor 	 ation 	 	and	 encourag 	 ement 	 	put	together	.
i	've	 tri 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 school 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 tri 	 ed 	 	all	over	the	world	,	and	 teacher 	 s 	 	sort	of	stand	back	and	say	,	``	it	just	 happen 	 s 	 	by	 it 	 self 	 	?	``	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	,	it	 happen 	 s 	 	by	 it 	 self 	 	.	``	``	how	did	you	know	that	?	``	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	wo	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	the	children	who	told	me	and	where	they	're	from	.	``	here	's	a	sole	in	action	.
 th 	 is 	 	one	is	in	england	.
he	 maintain 	 s 	 	law	and	order	,	 be 	 cause 	 	remember	,	there	's	no	teacher	around	.
girl	:	the	total	of	 electron 	 s 	 	is	not	equal	to	the	total	number	of	 proton 	 s 	 	--	sm	:	australia	girl	:	--	giving	it	a	net	positive	of	negative	 electric 	 al 	 	charge	.
the	net	charge	on	an	ion	is	equal	to	the	number	of	 proton 	 s 	 	in	the	ion	minus	the	number	of	 electron 	 s 	 	.
sm	:	a	decade	 a 	 head 	 	of	her	time	.
so	 sole 	 s 	 	,	i	think	we	need	a	curriculum	of	big	 question 	 s 	 	.
you	 al 	 ready 	 	heard	about	that	.	you	know	what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	.
there	was	a	time	when	stone	age	men	and	women	used	to	 s 	 it 	 	and	look	up	at	the	sky	and	say	,	``	what	are	 t 	 hose 	 	 twinkl 	 ing 	 	 light 	 s 	 	?	``	they	built	the	first	curriculum	,	but	we	've	lost	sight	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 won 	 dr 	 ous 	 	 question 	 s 	 	.
we	've	 br 	 ought 	 	it	down	to	the	 tan 	 gent 	 	of	an	angle	.
but	that	's	not	sexy	 en 	 ough 	 	.
the	way	you	would	put	it	to	a	nine	-	year	-	old	is	to	say	,	``	if	a	meteorite	was	coming	to	hit	the	earth	,	how	would	you	figure	out	if	it	was	going	to	or	not	?	``	and	if	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	well	,	what	?	how	?	``	you	say	,	``	there	's	a	magic	word	.	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 tan 	 gent 	 	of	an	angle	,	``	and	 leav 	 e 	 	him	 al 	 one 	 	.	he	'll	figure	it	out	.
so	here	are	a	couple	of	 image 	 s 	 	from	 sole 	 s 	 	.
i	've	 tri 	 ed 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	,	 in 	 credible 	 	 question 	 s 	 	--	``	when	did	the	world	begin	?	how	will	it	end	?	``	--	to	nine	-	year	-	olds	.
 th 	 is 	 	one	is	about	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	the	air	we	breathe	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 d 	 one 	 	by	children	 with 	 out 	 	the	help	of	any	teacher	.
the	teacher	 on 	 ly 	 	 raise 	 s 	 	the	question	,	and	then	 stand 	 s 	 	back	and	 admire 	 s 	 	the	answer	.
so	what	's	my	wish	?
my	wish	is	that	we	design	the	future	of	 learn 	 ing 	 	.
we	do	n't	want	to	be	spare	 part 	 s 	 	for	a	great	human	computer	,	do	we	?
so	we	need	to	design	a	future	for	 learn 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	've	got	to	--	hang	on	,	i	've	got	to	get	 th 	 is 	 	 word 	 ing 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	right	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	you	know	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
my	wish	is	to	help	design	a	future	of	 learn 	 ing 	 	by	 support 	 ing 	 	children	all	over	the	world	to	tap	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	wonder	and	 the 	 ir 	 	ability	to	work	together	.
help	me	build	 th 	 is 	 	school	.
it	will	be	 call 	 ed 	 	the	school	in	the	cloud	.
it	will	be	a	school	where	children	go	on	these	intellectual	 adventure 	 s 	 	driven	by	the	big	 question 	 s 	 	which	 the 	 ir 	 	 media 	 tors 	 	put	in	.
the	way	i	want	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	is	to	build	a	 facil 	 ity 	 	where	i	can	 stud 	 y 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	's	a	 facil 	 ity 	 	which	is	 practical 	 ly 	 	 un 	 mann 	 ed 	 	.
there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	one	 grann 	 y 	 	who	 manage 	 s 	 	health	and	 safe 	 ty 	 	.
the	rest	of	it	's	from	the	cloud	.
the	 light 	 s 	 	are	 turn 	 ed 	 	on	and	off	by	the	cloud	,	etc	.	,	etc	.	,	 every 	 thing 	 	's	 d 	 one 	 	from	the	cloud	.
but	i	want	you	for	 an 	 other 	 	purpose	.
you	can	do	self	-	 organize 	 d 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	 environment 	 s 	 	at	home	,	in	the	school	,	 out 	 side 	 	of	school	,	in	 club 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	to	do	.	there	's	a	great	document	 produce 	 d 	 	by	ted	which	 tell 	 s 	 	you	how	to	do	it	.
if	you	would	 pleas 	 e 	 	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	do	it	 a 	 cross 	 	all	five	 continent 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 end 	 	me	the	data	,	then	i	'll	put	it	all	together	,	move	it	 in 	 to 	 	the	school	of	 cloud 	 s 	 	,	and	create	the	future	of	 learn 	 ing 	 	.
that	's	my	wish	.
and	just	one	last	thing	.	i	'll	take	you	to	the	top	of	the	himalayas	.
at	12,000	feet	,	where	the	air	is	thin	,	i	once	built	two	hole	in	the	wall	 computer 	 s 	 	,	and	the	children	 flock 	 ed 	 	there	.
and	there	was	 th 	 is 	 	little	girl	who	was	 follow 	 ing 	 	me	around	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	to	her	,	``	you	know	,	i	want	to	give	a	computer	to	 every 	 body 	 	,	every	child	.
i	do	n't	know	,	what	should	i	do	?	``	and	i	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	take	a	picture	of	her	 quiet 	 ly 	 	.
she	 sudden 	 ly 	 	raised	her	hand	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	``	get	on	with	it	.	``	i	think	it	was	good	 ad 	 vice 	 	.
i	'll	follow	her	 ad 	 vice 	 	.	i	'll	stop	 talk 	 ing 	 	.
thank	you	.	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
thank	you	.	thank	you	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.	 w 	 ow 	 	.
