when	i	was	 consider 	 ing 	 	a	 care 	 er 	 	in	the	art	world	,	i	took	a	course	in	london	,	and	one	of	my	 super 	 visor 	 s 	 	was	 th 	 is 	 	irascible	italian	 call 	 ed 	 	pietro	,	who	 d 	 rank 	 	too	much	,	 smok 	 ed 	 	too	much	and	 s 	 wo 	 re 	 	much	too	much	.
but	he	was	a	passionate	teacher	,	and	i	remember	one	of	our	 ear 	 lier 	 	 class 	 es 	 	with	him	,	he	was	 project 	 ing 	 	 image 	 s 	 	on	the	wall	,	 ask 	 ing 	 	us	to	think	about	them	,	and	he	put	up	an	image	of	a	 paint 	 ing 	 	.
it	was	a	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	with	 figure 	 s 	 	,	semi	-	 dress 	 ed 	 	,	 drink 	 ing 	 	wine	.	there	was	a	 nud 	 e 	 	woman	in	the	lower	 fore 	 ground 	 	,	and	on	the	 hill 	 side 	 	in	the	back	,	there	was	a	figure	of	the	 mytho 	 logical 	 	god	bacchus	,
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	is	 th 	 is 	 	?	``	and	i	--	no	one	else	did	,	so	i	put	up	my	hand	,	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	it	's	a	bacchanal	by	titian	.	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	it	's	a	what	?	``	i	thought	 may 	 be 	 	i	'd	 pronounce 	 d 	 	it	wrong	.
``	it	's	a	bacchanal	by	titian	.	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	it	's	a	what	?	``	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	it	's	a	bacchanal	by	titian	.	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	boneless	bookworm	!
it	's	a	 fuck 	 ing 	 	orgy	!	``	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	he	 s 	 wo 	 re 	 	too	much	.
there	was	an	 import 	 ant 	 	 less 	 on 	 	for	me	in	that	.
pietro	was	suspicious	of	 form 	 al 	 	art	training	,	art	 histo 	 ry 	 	training	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 fear 	 ed 	 	that	it	 fill 	 ed 	 	people	up	with	 jar 	 gon 	 	,	and	then	they	just	 class 	 ified 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	looking	at	them	,	and	he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 re 	 mind 	 	us	that	all	art	was	once	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	,	and	he	 want 	 ed 	 	us	to	use	our	 eye 	 s 	 	,	and	he	was	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 evangel 	 ical 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	 mess 	 age 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	was	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	his	sight	.
he	 want 	 ed 	 	us	to	look	and	ask	 bas 	 ic 	 	 question 	 s 	 	of	 object 	 s 	 	.
what	is	it	?	how	is	it	made	?	why	was	it	made	?
how	is	it	used	?
and	these	 we 	 re 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	to	me	when	i	 sub 	 sequent 	 ly 	 	 be 	 came 	 	a	professional	art	historian	.
my	kind	of	eureka	moment	came	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	when	i	was	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	the	art	of	the	 court 	 s 	 	of	 north 	 ern 	 	europe	,	and	of	course	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	much	 discuss 	 ed 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	the	 sculpt 	 ures 	 	and	the	 architect 	 ure 	 	of	the	day	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	read	 historic 	 al 	 	 document 	 s 	 	and	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	 de 	 script 	 ions 	 	,	i	found	there	was	a	kind	of	a	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	component	,	for	 every 	 where 	 	i	came	 a 	 cross 	 	 de 	 script 	 ions 	 	of	 tape 	 s 	 tries 	 	.
 tape 	 s 	 tries 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 ubiqu 	 it 	 ous 	 	between	the	middle	 age 	 s 	 	and	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	well	 in 	 to 	 	the	18th	century	,	and	it	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	 ap 	 parent 	 	why	.
 tape 	 s 	 tries 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 port 	 able 	 	.	you	could	roll	them	up	,	 s 	 end 	 	them	 a 	 head 	 	of	you	,	and	in	the	time	it	took	to	hang	them	up	,	you	could	transform	a	cold	,	dank	 in 	 terior 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	richly	 color 	 ed 	 	setting	.
 tape 	 s 	 tries 	 	 effective 	 ly 	 	 provide 	 d 	 	a	vast	canvas	on	which	the	 patron 	 s 	 	of	the	day	could	depict	the	heroes	with	whom	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	 associate 	 d 	 	,	or	even	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	and	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	that	,	 tape 	 s 	 tries 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 huge 	 ly 	 	expensive	.
they	 requir 	 ed 	 	 score 	 s 	 	of	 high 	 ly 	 	 skill 	 ed 	 	 weave 	 rs 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	over	 extend 	 ed 	 	 period 	 s 	 	of	time	with	 ver 	 y 	 	expensive	 material 	 s 	 	--	the	wools	,	the	 silk 	 s 	 	,	even	gold	and	silver	 th 	 read 	 	.
so	,	all	in	all	,	in	an	age	when	the	visual	image	of	any	kind	was	rare	,	 tape 	 s 	 tries 	 	 we 	 re 	 	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	potent	form	of	 propag 	 and 	 a 	 	.
well	,	i	 be 	 came 	 	a	 tape 	 stry 	 	historian	.
in	due	course	,	i	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 a 	 s 	 	a	 cur 	 ator 	 	at	the	 metro 	 politan 	 	museum	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	saw	the	met	 a 	 s 	 	one	of	the	few	 place 	 s 	 	where	i	could	organize	 re 	 ally 	 	big	 exhibit 	 ions 	 	about	the	subject	i	 car 	 ed 	 	so	 passionate 	 ly 	 	about	.
and	in	about	1997	,	the	then	-	director	philippe	de	montebello	 g 	 ave 	 	me	the	go	-	 a 	 head 	 	to	organize	an	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	for	2002	.	we	 normal 	 ly 	 	have	these	 ver 	 y 	 	long	lead	-	in	 time 	 s 	 	.
it	was	n't	 straight 	 forward 	 	.	it	's	no	 long 	 er 	 	a	question	of	chucking	a	 tape 	 stry 	 	in	the	back	of	a	car	.
they	have	to	be	wound	on	huge	 roller 	 s 	 	,	 ship 	 ped 	 	in	 over 	 sized 	 	freighters	.
some	of	them	are	so	big	we	had	,	to	get	them	 in 	 to 	 	the	museum	,	we	had	to	take	them	up	the	great	 step 	 s 	 	at	the	front	.
we	thought	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	about	how	to	present	 th 	 is 	 	 un 	 known 	 	subject	to	a	modern	audience	:	the	dark	 color 	 s 	 	to	set	off	the	 color 	 s 	 	that	 remain 	 ed 	 	in	 object 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	often	 fad 	 ed 	 	;	the	placing	of	 light 	 s 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	out	the	silk	and	the	gold	 th 	 read 	 	;	the	 label 	 ing 	 	.
you	know	,	we	live	in	an	age	where	we	are	so	used	to	 tele 	 vision 	 	 image 	 s 	 	and	 photograph 	 s 	 	,	a	one	-	hit	image	.	these	 we 	 re 	 	big	,	complex	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 al 	 most 	 	like	 cartoon 	 s 	 	with	 multi 	 ple 	 	 narrative 	 s 	 	.
we	had	to	draw	our	audience	in	,	get	them	to	 s 	 low 	 	down	,	to	explore	the	 object 	 s 	 	.
there	was	a	lot	of	 skeptic 	 ism 	 	.	on	the	 open 	 ing 	 	night	,	i	 over 	 heard 	 	one	of	the	senior	 member 	 s 	 	of	staff	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	be	a	bomb	.	``	but	in	 re 	 ality 	 	,	in	the	course	of	the	coming	 week 	 s 	 	and	 month 	 s 	 	,	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	came	to	see	the	show	.
the	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	was	designed	to	be	an	experience	,	and	 tape 	 s 	 tries 	 	are	hard	to	 re 	 produce 	 	in	 photograph 	 s 	 	.
so	i	want	you	to	use	your	 imagin 	 ations 	 	,	 think 	 ing 	 	of	these	wall	-	high	 object 	 s 	 	,	some	of	them	10	 meter 	 s 	 	wide	,	 depict 	 ing 	 	lavish	court	 scene 	 s 	 	with	courtiers	and	dandies	who	would	look	 quit 	 e 	 	at	home	in	the	 page 	 s 	 	of	the	fashion	press	 to 	 day 	 	,	thick	 wood 	 s 	 	with	 hunter 	 s 	 	 crash 	 ing 	 	through	the	undergrowth	in	 pur 	 suit 	 	of	wild	boars	and	 de 	 er 	 	,	violent	 battle 	 s 	 	with	 scene 	 s 	 	of	fear	and	 hero 	 ism 	 	.
i	remember	taking	my	son	's	school	class	.	he	was	eight	at	the	time	,	and	all	the	little	 boy 	 s 	 	,	they	kind	of	--	you	know	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	little	 boy 	 s 	 	,	and	then	the	thing	that	caught	 the 	 ir 	 	attention	was	in	one	of	the	 hunt 	 ing 	 	 scene 	 s 	 	there	was	a	dog	 poop 	 ing 	 	in	the	 fore 	 ground 	 	--	--	kind	of	an	in	-	your	-	face	joke	by	the	artist	.
and	you	can	just	imagine	them	.
but	it	 br 	 ought 	 	it	 al 	 ive 	 	to	them	.	i	think	they	 sudden 	 ly 	 	saw	that	these	 we 	 re 	 	n't	just	old	 fad 	 ed 	 	 tape 	 s 	 tries 	 	.
these	 we 	 re 	 	 image 	 s 	 	of	the	world	in	the	past	,	and	that	it	was	the	same	for	our	audience	.
and	for	me	 a 	 s 	 	a	 cur 	 ator 	 	,	i	felt	proud	.	i	felt	i	'd	 shift 	 ed 	 	the	needle	a	little	.
through	 th 	 is 	 	experience	that	could	 on 	 ly 	 	be	 create 	 d 	 	in	a	museum	,	i	'd	 open 	 ed 	 	up	the	 eye 	 s 	 	of	my	audience	--	 historian 	 s 	 	,	 artist 	 s 	 	,	press	,	the	general	public	--	to	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	lost	medium	.
a	few	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	i	was	 invit 	 ed 	 	to	be	the	director	of	the	museum	,	and	after	i	got	over	that	--	``	who	,	me	?	the	 tape 	 stry 	 	geek	?	i	do	n't	wear	a	tie	!	``	--	i	 real 	 ized 	 	the	fact	:	i	 believ 	 e 	 	 passionate 	 ly 	 	in	that	 cur 	 ated 	 	museum	experience	.
we	live	in	an	age	of	 ubiqu 	 it 	 ous 	 	information	,	and	sort	of	``	just	add	water	``	 expert 	 ise 	 	,	but	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	that	 compar 	 es 	 	with	the	 present 	 ation 	 	of	significant	 object 	 s 	 	in	a	well	-	told	narrative	,	what	the	 cur 	 ator 	 	 do 	 es 	 	,	the	 interpret 	 ation 	 	of	a	complex	,	esoteric	subject	,	in	a	way	that	 retain 	 s 	 	the	 integ 	 r 	 ity 	 	of	the	subject	,	that	 make 	 s 	 	it	--	 un 	 pack 	 s 	 	it	for	a	general	audience	.
and	that	,	to	me	,	 to 	 day 	 	,	is	now	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	and	the	 f 	 un 	 	of	my	job	,	 support 	 ing 	 	the	vision	of	my	 cur 	 ators 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	an	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	of	samurai	 s 	 word 	 s 	 	,	early	 by 	 zantine 	 	 artifact 	 s 	 	,	 ren 	 aiss 	 ance 	 	 portrait 	 s 	 	,	or	the	show	we	heard	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	,	the	mcqueen	show	,	with	which	we	 enjoy 	 ed 	 	so	much	success	last	summer	.
that	was	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	case	.
in	the	late	spring	,	early	summer	of	2010	,	 short 	 ly 	 	after	mcqueen	's	 su 	 icide 	 	,	our	 cur 	 ator 	 	of	 cost 	 ume 	 	,	andrew	bolton	,	came	to	see	me	,	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	of	 do 	 ing 	 	a	show	on	mcqueen	,	and	now	is	the	moment	.	we	have	to	,	we	have	to	do	it	fast	.	``	it	was	n't	easy	.	mcqueen	had	 work 	 ed 	 	 through 	 out 	 	his	 care 	 er 	 	with	a	small	team	of	 design 	 ers 	 	and	 manage 	 rs 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 protect 	 ive 	 	of	his	 leg 	 acy 	 	,	but	andrew	went	to	london	and	 work 	 ed 	 	with	them	over	the	summer	and	won	 the 	 ir 	 	confidence	,	and	that	of	the	 design 	 ers 	 	who	 create 	 d 	 	his	 amaz 	 ing 	 	fashion	 show 	 s 	 	,	which	 we 	 re 	 	 work 	 s 	 	of	performance	art	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	right	,	and	we	 proceed 	 ed 	 	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	at	the	museum	,	i	think	,	we	've	never	 d 	 one 	 	before	.
it	was	n't	just	your	standard	 install 	 ation 	 	.
in	fact	,	we	 rip 	 ped 	 	down	the	 gall 	 eries 	 	to	 re 	 create 	 	 entire 	 ly 	 	different	 setting 	 s 	 	,	a	 re 	 creation 	 	of	his	first	studio	,	a	hall	of	 mirror 	 s 	 	,	a	curiosity	box	,	a	sunken	ship	,	a	 burn 	 ed 	 	-	out	 in 	 terior 	 	,	with	 video 	 s 	 	and	 sound 	 track 	 s 	 	that	 rang 	 ed 	 	from	 opera 	 tic 	 	 aria 	 s 	 	to	 pig 	 s 	 	fornicating	.
and	in	 th 	 is 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	setting	,	the	 cost 	 ume 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	like	 act 	 ors 	 	and	 actress 	 es 	 	,	or	living	 sculpt 	 ures 	 	.
it	could	have	 be 	 en 	 	a	train	wreck	.
it	could	have	 look 	 ed 	 	like	shop	 window 	 s 	 	on	fifth	 a 	 venue 	 	at	christmas	,	but	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	way	that	andrew	 connect 	 ed 	 	with	the	mcqueen	team	,	he	was	 channel 	 ing 	 	the	 raw 	 ness 	 	and	the	 brilli 	 ance 	 	of	mcqueen	,	and	the	show	was	 quit 	 e 	 	transcendant	,	and	it	 be 	 came 	 	a	 phenomen 	 on 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	own	right	.
by	the	end	of	the	show	,	we	had	people	queuing	for	four	or	five	 hour 	 s 	 	to	get	 in 	 to 	 	the	show	,	but	no	one	 re 	 ally 	 	 complain 	 ed 	 	.
i	heard	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	,	``	 w 	 ow 	 	,	that	was	worth	it	.
it	was	a	 s 	 uch 	 	a	visceral	,	 e 	 motive 	 	experience	.	``	now	,	i	've	 de 	 scribed 	 	two	 ver 	 y 	 	 immers 	 ive 	 	 exhibit 	 ions 	 	,	but	i	 al 	 so 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 collect 	 ions 	 	,	individual	 object 	 s 	 	,	can	 al 	 so 	 	have	that	same	power	.
the	met	was	set	up	not	 a 	 s 	 	a	museum	of	american	art	,	but	of	an	 ency 	 clo 	 pedic 	 	museum	,	and	 to 	 day 	 	,	140	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	that	vision	is	 a 	 s 	 	 pre 	 scient 	 	 a 	 s 	 	ever	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	of	course	,	we	live	in	a	world	of	crisis	,	of	 challeng 	 e 	 	,	and	we	're	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	to	it	through	the	24/7	 news 	 reel 	 s 	 	.
it	's	in	our	 gall 	 eries 	 	that	we	can	 un 	 pack 	 	the	 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	,	the	 culture 	 s 	 	,	that	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	the	current	 manifest 	 ation 	 	of	.

i	think	for	most	americans	,	knowledge	of	the	islamic	world	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	 s 	 light 	 	before	9/11	,	and	then	it	was	thrust	 up 	 on 	 	us	in	one	of	america	's	 dark 	 est 	 	 hour 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 per 	 ception 	 	was	through	the	 polar 	 ization 	 	of	that	 terr 	 ible 	 	event	.
