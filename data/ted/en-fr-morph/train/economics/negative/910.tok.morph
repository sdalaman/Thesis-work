i	'm	ellen	,	and	i	'm	 total 	 ly 	 	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	food	.
but	i	did	n't	start	out	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	food	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	out	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	global	security	policy	 be 	 cause 	 	i	lived	in	new	york	 dur 	 ing 	 	9/11	,	and	it	was	 obvious 	 ly 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	relevant	thing	.
and	i	got	from	global	security	policy	to	food	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 real 	 ized 	 	when	i	'm	 hung 	 ry 	 	,	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 piss 	 ed 	 	off	,
and	i	'm	 assum 	 ing 	 	that	the	rest	of	the	world	is	too	.
 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	if	you	're	 hung 	 ry 	 	and	your	 kid 	 s 	 	are	 hung 	 ry 	 	and	your	neighbor	's	 kid 	 s 	 	are	 hung 	 ry 	 	and	your	whole	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	is	 hung 	 ry 	 	,	you	're	 pre 	 tty 	 	 ang 	 ry 	 	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	lo	and	 be 	 hold 	 	,	it	 look 	 s 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	like	the	 area 	 s 	 	of	the	world	that	are	 hung 	 ry 	 	are	 al 	 so 	 	the	 area 	 s 	 	of	the	world	that	are	 pre 	 tty 	 	 in 	 secure 	 	.
so	i	took	a	job	at	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	world	food	programme	 a 	 s 	 	a	way	to	try	to	address	these	security	 issue 	 s 	 	through	food	security	 issue 	 s 	 	.
and	while	i	was	there	,	i	came	 a 	 cross 	 	what	i	think	is	the	most	 brilli 	 ant 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 program 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	school	 feed 	 ing 	 	,	and	it	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	simple	idea	to	sort	of	get	in	the	middle	of	the	cycle	of	poverty	and	 hung 	 er 	 	that	 continu 	 es 	 	for	a	lot	of	people	around	the	world	,	and	stop	it	.
by	giving	 kid 	 s 	 	a	free	school	meal	,	it	 get 	 s 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	school	,	which	is	 obvious 	 ly 	 	education	,	the	first	step	out	of	poverty	,
but	it	 al 	 so 	 	 give 	 s 	 	them	the	 micro 	 nutrient 	 s 	 	and	the	 macro 	 nutrient 	 s 	 	they	need	to	 re 	 ally 	 	develop	both	 ment 	 ally 	 	and	 physical 	 ly 	 	.
while	i	was	 work 	 ing 	 	at	the	u.n.	,	i	met	 th 	 is 	 	girl	.	her	name	is	lauren	bush	.
and	she	had	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	awesome	idea	to	sell	the	bag	 call 	 ed 	 	the	``	feed	bag	``	--	which	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 beaut 	 i 	 fully 	 	 iron 	 ic 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	you	can	 s 	 trap 	 	on	the	feed	bag	.
but	each	bag	we	'd	sell	would	provide	a	year	's	worth	of	school	 meal 	 s 	 	for	one	kid	.
it	's	so	simple	,	and	we	thought	,	you	know	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	it	 cost 	 s 	 	between	20	and	50	 buck 	 s 	 	to	provide	school	 feed 	 ing 	 	for	a	year	.
we	could	sell	these	 bag 	 s 	 	and	raise	a	ton	of	money	and	a	ton	of	 aware 	 ness 	 	for	the	world	food	programme	.
but	of	course	,	you	know	at	the	u.n.	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	move	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	,	and	they	 bas 	 ically 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	no	.
and	we	thought	,	god	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 s 	 uch 	 	a	good	idea	and	it	's	going	to	raise	so	much	money	.
so	we	 s 	 aid 	 	screw	it	,	we	'll	just	start	our	own	company	,	which	we	did	three	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
so	that	was	kind	of	my	first	dream	,	was	to	start	 th 	 is 	 	company	 call 	 ed 	 	feed	,
and	here	's	a	 screen 	 shot 	 	of	our	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
we	did	 th 	 is 	 	bag	for	 ha 	 iti 	 	,	and	we	 launch 	 ed 	 	it	just	a	month	after	the	 earth 	 quake 	 	to	provide	school	 meal 	 s 	 	for	 kid 	 s 	 	in	 ha 	 iti 	 	.
so	feed	's	 do 	 ing 	 	great	.	we	've	so	far	 provide 	 d 	 	55	million	 meal 	 s 	 	to	 kid 	 s 	 	around	the	world	by	selling	now	550,000	 bag 	 s 	 	,	a	ton	of	 bag 	 s 	 	,	a	lot	of	 bag 	 s 	 	.
all	 th 	 is 	 	time	you	're	--	when	you	think	about	 hung 	 er 	 	,	it	's	a	hard	thing	to	think	about	,	 be 	 cause 	 	what	we	think	about	is	eating	.
i	think	about	eating	a	lot	,	and	i	 re 	 ally 	 	love	it	.
and	the	thing	that	's	a	little	strange	about	 inter 	 national 	 	 hung 	 er 	 	and	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 inter 	 national 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	is	that	most	people	kind	of	want	to	know	:	``	what	are	you	 do 	 ing 	 	in	america	?	``
``	what	are	you	 do 	 ing 	 	for	america	's	 kid 	 s 	 	?	``
there	's	 definite 	 ly 	 	 hung 	 er 	 	in	america	:	49	million	people	and	 al 	 most 	 	16.7	million	children	.
i	mean	that	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	 dramat 	 ic 	 	for	our	own	country	.
 hung 	 er 	 	 definite 	 ly 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	a	little	bit	different	in	america	than	it	 do 	 es 	 	 inter 	 national 	 ly 	 	,	but	it	's	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	address	 hung 	 er 	 	in	our	own	country	.
but	 obvious 	 ly 	 	the	 big 	 ger 	 	problem	that	we	all	know	about	is	 obes 	 ity 	 	,	and	it	's	 dramat 	 ic 	 	.
the	other	thing	that	's	 dramat 	 ic 	 	is	that	both	 hung 	 er 	 	and	 obes 	 ity 	 	have	 re 	 ally 	 	 ris 	 en 	 	in	the	last	30	 year 	 s 	 	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	 obes 	 ity 	 	's	not	 on 	 ly 	 	an	american	problem	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 spread 	 ing 	 	all	around	the	world	and	 main 	 ly 	 	through	our	kind	of	food	 system 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 export 	 ing 	 	.
the	 number 	 s 	 	are	 pre 	 tty 	 	crazy	.
there	's	a	billion	people	 obes 	 e 	 	or	 over 	 weight 	 	and	a	billion	people	 hung 	 ry 	 	.
so	 t 	 hose 	 	seem	like	two	 bifurc 	 ated 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	,	but	i	kind	of	 start 	 ed 	 	to	think	about	,	you	know	,	what	is	 obes 	 ity 	 	and	 hung 	 er 	 	?	what	are	both	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	about	?
well	,	they	're	both	about	food	.
and	when	you	think	about	food	,	the	 under 	 pinning 	 	of	food	in	both	 case 	 s 	 	is	 potential 	 ly 	 	 problem 	 atic 	 	 agricultur 	 e 	 	.
and	 agricultur 	 e 	 	is	where	food	 come 	 s 	 	from	.
well	,	 agricultur 	 e 	 	in	america	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 con 	 solid 	 ated 	 	,
and	the	 food 	 s 	 	that	are	 produce 	 d 	 	lead	to	the	 food 	 s 	 	that	we	eat	.
well	,	the	 food 	 s 	 	that	are	 produce 	 d 	 	are	,	more	or	less	,	corn	,	 so 	 y 	 	and	wheat	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	that	's	three	-	 quarter 	 s 	 	of	the	food	that	we	're	eating	for	the	most	part	:	 process 	 ed 	 	 food 	 s 	 	and	fast	 food 	 s 	 	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	in	our	 agricultur 	 al 	 	system	,	we	have	n't	 d 	 one 	 	a	good	job	in	the	last	three	 decade 	 s 	 	of	 export 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	around	the	world	.
so	african	 agricultur 	 e 	 	,	which	is	the	place	of	most	 hung 	 er 	 	in	the	world	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 fall 	 en 	 	 precipit 	 ously 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 hung 	 er 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 ris 	 en 	 	.
so	 some 	 how 	 	we	're	not	making	the	connect	between	 export 	 ing 	 	a	good	 agricultur 	 al 	 	system	that	will	help	feed	people	all	around	the	world	.
who	is	 farm 	 ing 	 	them	?	that	's	what	i	was	 wonder 	 ing 	 	.
so	i	went	and	stood	on	a	big	grain	bin	in	the	 mid 	 west 	 	,
and	that	 re 	 ally 	 	did	n't	help	me	understand	 farm 	 ing 	 	,	but	i	think	it	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	picture	.
and	you	know	,	the	 re 	 ality 	 	is	that	between	 farm 	 ers 	 	in	america	,	who	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 quit 	 e 	 	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	when	i	 s 	 pend 	 	time	in	the	 mid 	 west 	 	,	are	 pre 	 tty 	 	large	in	general	.
and	 the 	 ir 	 	 farm 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 so 	 	large	.
but	 farm 	 ers 	 	in	the	rest	of	the	world	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 skin 	 ny 	 	,	and	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 starv 	 ing 	 	.
most	 hung 	 ry 	 	people	in	the	world	are	 sub 	 s 	 ist 	 ence 	 	 farm 	 ers 	 	.
and	most	of	 t 	 hose 	 	people	are	women	--	which	is	a	 total 	 ly 	 	other	 top 	 ic 	 	that	i	wo	n't	get	on	right	now	,	but	i	'd	love	to	do	the	feminist	thing	at	some	point	.
i	think	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	look	at	 agricultur 	 e 	 	from	these	two	 side 	 s 	 	.
there	's	 th 	 is 	 	large	,	 con 	 solid 	 ated 	 	 farm 	 ing 	 	that	's	led	to	what	we	eat	in	america	,
and	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 be 	 en 	 	since	around	1980	,	after	the	oil	crisis	,	when	,	you	know	,	mass	 con 	 solid 	 ation 	 	,	mass	 exo 	 du 	 s 	 	of	small	 farm 	 ers 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	.
and	then	in	the	same	time	period	,	you	know	,	we	've	kind	of	left	africa	's	 farm 	 ers 	 	to	do	 the 	 ir 	 	own	thing	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	what	is	 farm 	 ed 	 	 end 	 s 	 	up	 a 	 s 	 	what	we	eat	.
and	in	america	,	a	lot	of	what	we	eat	 ha 	 s 	 	led	to	 obes 	 ity 	 	and	 ha 	 s 	 	led	to	a	real	change	in	sort	of	what	our	diet	is	in	the	last	30	 year 	 s 	 	.
it	's	crazy	.
a	fifth	of	 kid 	 s 	 	under	two	 drink 	 s 	 	soda	.
 hell 	 o 	 	.	you	do	n't	put	soda	in	 bottle 	 s 	 	.
but	people	do	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	so	cheap	,
and	so	our	whole	food	system	in	the	last	30	 year 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 shift 	 ed 	 	.
i	think	,	you	know	,	it	's	not	just	in	our	own	country	,	but	 re 	 ally 	 	we	're	 export 	 ing 	 	the	system	around	the	world	,
and	when	you	look	at	the	data	of	 l 	 east 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	--	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	in	cities	,	which	are	growing	 re 	 ally 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	--	people	are	eating	american	 process 	 ed 	 	 food 	 s 	 	.
and	in	one	generation	,	they	're	going	from	 hung 	 er 	 	,	and	all	of	the	 detri 	 mental 	 	health	 effect 	 s 	 	of	 hung 	 er 	 	,	to	 obes 	 ity 	 	and	 thing 	 s 	 	like	diabetes	and	heart	disease	in	one	generation	.
so	the	 problem 	 atic 	 	food	system	is	 affect 	 ing 	 	both	 hung 	 er 	 	and	 obes 	 ity 	 	.
not	to	beat	a	dead	horse	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	global	food	system	where	there	's	a	billion	people	 hung 	 ry 	 	and	billion	people	 obes 	 e 	 	.
i	think	that	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	to	look	at	it	.
and	 in 	 stead 	 	of	taking	these	two	 thing 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 bifurc 	 ated 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	that	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 separat 	 e 	 	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	look	at	them	 a 	 s 	 	one	system	.
we	get	a	lot	of	our	food	from	all	around	the	world	,
and	people	from	all	around	the	world	are	 import 	 ing 	 	our	food	system	,
so	it	's	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	relevant	to	start	a	new	way	of	looking	at	it	.
the	thing	is	,	i	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	--	and	the	technology	people	that	are	here	,	which	i	'm	 total 	 ly 	 	not	one	of	them	--	but	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	,	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 take 	 s 	 	30	 year 	 s 	 	for	a	lot	of	 techno 	 logies 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 en 	 demic 	 	to	us	,	like	the	mouse	and	the	 inter 	 net 	 	and	 window 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	there	's	30	-	year	 cycle 	 s 	 	.
i	think	2010	can	be	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	year
 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	the	end	of	the	30	-	year	cycle	,
and	it	's	the	 birth 	 day 	 	of	the	global	food	system	.
so	that	's	the	first	 birth 	 day 	 	i	want	to	talk	about	.
you	know	,	i	think	if	we	 re 	 ally 	 	think	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	last	30	 year 	 s 	 	,	there	's	hope	in	that	.
it	's	the	 thirt 	 ieth 	 	 annivers 	 ary 	 	of	gmo	 crop 	 s 	 	and	the	big	gulp	,	chicken	mcnuggets	,	high	fructose	corn	syrup	,	the	farm	crisis	in	america	and	the	change	in	how	we	've	 address 	 ed 	 	 agricultur 	 e 	 	 inter 	 national 	 ly 	 	.
so	there	's	a	lot	of	 reason 	 s 	 	to	take	 th 	 is 	 	30	-	year	time	period	 a 	 s 	 	sort	of	the	creation	of	 th 	 is 	 	new	food	system	.
i	'm	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	one	who	's	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	whole	30	-	year	thing	.
the	 icon 	 s 	 	like	michael	pollan	and	jamie	oliver	in	his	ted	prize	wish	both	 address 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	last	three	-	decade	time	period	 a 	 s 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	relevant	for	food	system	change	.
well	,	i	 re 	 ally 	 	care	about	1980	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	the	 thirt 	 ieth 	 	 annivers 	 ary 	 	of	me	 th 	 is 	 	year	.
and	so	in	my	 life 	 time 	 	,	a	lot	of	what	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	world	--	and	 be 	 ing 	 	a	person	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	food	--	a	lot	of	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 change 	 d 	 	.
so	my	second	dream	is	that	i	think	we	can	look	to	the	next	30	 year 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	time	to	change	the	food	system	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	we	know	what	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	past	,	so	if	we	start	now	,	and	we	look	at	 techno 	 logies 	 	and	 improve 	 ments 	 	to	the	food	system	long	term	,	we	might	be	able	to	 re 	 create 	 	the	food	system
so	when	i	give	my	next	talk	and	i	'm	60	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	i	'll	be	able	to	say	that	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	success	.
so	i	'm	 announc 	 ing 	 	 to 	 day 	 	the	start	of	a	new	 organ 	 ization 	 	,	or	a	new	fund	 with 	 in 	 	the	feed	 found 	 ation 	 	,	 call 	 ed 	 	the	30	project	.
and	the	30	project	is	 re 	 ally 	 	focused	on	these	long	-	term	 idea 	 s 	 	for	food	system	change	.
and	i	think	by	 align 	 ing 	 	 inter 	 national 	 	 advoc 	 ates 	 	that	are	 address 	 ing 	 	 hung 	 er 	 	and	domestic	 advoc 	 ates 	 	that	are	 address 	 ing 	 	 obes 	 ity 	 	,	we	might	 actual 	 ly 	 	look	for	long	-	term	 solution 	 s 	 	that	will	make	the	food	system	better	for	 every 	 one 	 	.
we	all	tend	to	think	that	these	 system 	 s 	 	are	 quit 	 e 	 	different	,
and	people	 argu 	 e 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	 organ 	 ic 	 	can	feed	the	world	,
but	if	we	take	a	30	-	year	view	,	there	's	more	hope	in	 collabor 	 ative 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	.
so	i	'm	 hop 	 ing 	 	that	by	 connect 	 ing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	disparate	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	like	the	one	campaign	and	 s 	 low 	 	food	,	which	do	n't	seem	right	now	to	have	much	in	common	,	we	can	talk	about	 hol 	 istic 	 	,	long	-	term	,	 system 	 ic 	 	 solution 	 s 	 	that	will	improve	food	for	 every 	 one 	 	.
some	 idea 	 s 	 	i	've	had	is	like	,	look	,	the	 re 	 ality 	 	is	--	 kid 	 s 	 	in	the	south	bronx	need	 apple 	 s 	 	and	 carrot 	 s 	 	and	so	do	 kid 	 s 	 	in	botswana	.
and	how	are	we	going	to	get	 t 	 hose 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 nut 	 rit 	 ious 	 	 food 	 s 	 	?
 an 	 other 	 	thing	that	's	 be 	 come 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	global	is	production	of	meat	and	fish	.
 understand 	 ing 	 	how	to	produce	protein	in	a	way	that	's	 health 	 y 	 	for	the	environment	and	 health 	 y 	 	for	people	will	be	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	address	 thing 	 s 	 	like	climate	change	and	how	we	use	 petro 	 chemical 	 	 fertil 	 izer 	 s 	 	.
and	you	know	,	these	are	 re 	 ally 	 	relevant	 top 	 ic 	 s 	 	that	are	long	term	and	 import 	 ant 	 	for	both	people	in	africa	who	are	small	 farm 	 ers 	 	and	people	in	america	who	are	 farm 	 ers 	 	and	 eater 	 s 	 	.
and	i	 al 	 so 	 	think	that	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 process 	 ed 	 	 food 	 s 	 	in	a	new	way	,	where	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	price	the	negative	 external 	 ities 	 	like	 petro 	 chemical 	 s 	 	and	like	 fertil 	 izer 	 	 run 	 off 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	price	of	a	bag	of	 chip 	 s 	 	.
well	,	if	that	bag	of	 chip 	 s 	 	then	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 inherent 	 ly 	 	more	expensive	than	an	apple	,	then	 may 	 be 	 	it	's	time	for	a	different	sense	of	personal	 respons 	 ibility 	 	in	food	choice	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 choice 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 choice 	 s 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	three	-	 quarter 	 s 	 	of	the	 product 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	made	just	from	corn	,	 so 	 y 	 	and	wheat	.
the	30project.org	is	 launch 	 ed 	 	,	and	i	've	 gather 	 ed 	 	a	 coal 	 ition 	 	of	a	few	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	to	start	.
and	it	'll	be	growing	over	the	next	few	 month 	 s 	 	.
but	i	 re 	 ally 	 	hope	that	you	will	all	think	of	ways	that	you	can	look	long	term	at	 thing 	 s 	 	like	the	food	system	and	make	change	.
