can	i	ask	you	to	 pleas 	 e 	 	recall	a	time	when	you	 re 	 ally 	 	 love 	 d 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	--	a	movie	,	an	 al 	 bum 	 	,	a	song	or	a	book	--	and	you	 recommend 	 ed 	 	it	 whole 	 hearted 	 ly 	 	to	 some 	 one 	 	you	 al 	 so 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 like 	 d 	 	,	and	you	 anticip 	 ated 	 	that	 re 	 action 	 	,	you	 wait 	 ed 	 	for	it	,	and	it	came	back	,	and	the	person	 hat 	 ed 	 	it	?
so	,	by	way	of	 introduc 	 tion 	 	,	that	is	the	exact	same	state	in	which	i	 s 	 pent 	 	every	 work 	 ing 	 	day	of	the	last	six	 year 	 s 	 	.
i	teach	high	school	math	.
i	sell	a	product	to	a	market	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	want	it	,	but	is	 force 	 d 	 	by	law	to	buy	it	.
i	mean	,	it	's	just	a	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	 pro 	 position 	 	.
so	there	's	a	 use 	 ful 	 	 stereo 	 type 	 	about	 student 	 s 	 	that	i	see	,	a	 use 	 ful 	 	 stereo 	 type 	 	about	you	all	.
i	could	give	you	 guy 	 s 	 	an	algebra	-	two	final	 ex 	 am 	 	,	and	i	would	expect	no	 high 	 er 	 	than	a	25	percent	pass	rate	.
and	both	of	these	 fact 	 s 	 	say	less	about	you	or	my	 student 	 s 	 	than	they	do	about	what	we	call	math	education	in	the	u.s.	 to 	 day 	 	.
to	start	with	,	i	'd	like	to	break	math	down	 in 	 to 	 	two	 categor 	 ies 	 	.
one	is	computation	;	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	stuff	you	've	 for 	 gotten 	 	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 factor 	 ing 	 	 quad 	 ratic 	 s 	 	with	 lead 	 ing 	 	 co 	 efficient 	 s 	 	 great 	 er 	 	than	one	.
 th 	 is 	 	stuff	is	 al 	 so 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	easy	to	 re 	 learn 	 	,	 provide 	 d 	 	you	have	a	 re 	 ally 	 	strong	 ground 	 ing 	 	in	 reason 	 ing 	 	.	math	 reason 	 ing 	 	--
we	'll	call	it	the	application	of	math	 process 	 es 	 	to	the	world	around	us	--
 th 	 is 	 	is	hard	to	teach	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	would	love	 student 	 s 	 	to	retain	,	even	if	they	do	n't	go	 in 	 to 	 	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 field 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	,	the	way	we	teach	it	in	the	u.s.	all	but	 ensure 	 s 	 	they	wo	n't	retain	it	.
so	,	i	'd	like	to	talk	about	why	that	is	,	why	that	's	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 calam 	 ity 	 	for	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	what	we	can	do	about	it	and	,	to	close	with	,	why	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	time	to	be	a	math	teacher	.
so	first	,	five	 symptom 	 s 	 	that	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	math	 reason 	 ing 	 	wrong	in	your	 class 	 room 	 	.
one	is	a	lack	of	 initi 	 ative 	 	;	your	 student 	 s 	 	do	n't	self	-	start	.
you	finish	your	 lectur 	 e 	 	block	and	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	you	have	five	 hand 	 s 	 	going	up	 ask 	 ing 	 	you	to	re	-	explain	the	entire	thing	at	 the 	 ir 	 	 desk 	 s 	 	.
 student 	 s 	 	lack	 persever 	 ance 	 	.
they	lack	 re 	 tent 	 ion 	 	;	you	find	 your 	 self 	 	re	-	 explain 	 ing 	 	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	three	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	 whole 	 sale 	 	.
there	's	an	 a 	 version 	 	to	word	 problem 	 s 	 	,	which	 de 	 scribe 	 s 	 	99	percent	of	my	 student 	 s 	 	.
and	then	the	other	one	percent	is	 eager 	 ly 	 	looking	for	the	formula	to	 app 	 ly 	 	in	that	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 destruct 	 ive 	 	.
david	milch	,	creator	of	``	deadwood	``	and	other	 amaz 	 ing 	 	tv	 show 	 s 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	good	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	.
he	 s 	 wo 	 re 	 	off	creating	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	drama	,	 show 	 s 	 	set	in	the	present	day	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	saw	that	when	people	fill	 the 	 ir 	 	mind	with	four	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	of	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	``	two	and	a	half	men	,	``	no	 dis 	 respect 	 	,	it	 shape 	 s 	 	the	neural	 path 	 ways 	 	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	in	 s 	 uch 	 	a	way	that	they	expect	simple	 problem 	 s 	 	.
he	 call 	 ed 	 	it	,	``	an	 im 	 patience 	 	with	 ir 	 re 	 solution 	 	.	``
you	're	 im 	 patient 	 	with	 thing 	 s 	 	that	do	n't	 re 	 solve 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
you	expect	sitcom	-	sized	 problem 	 s 	 	that	wrap	up	in	22	 minute 	 s 	 	,	three	commercial	 break 	 s 	 	and	a	laugh	track	.
and	i	'll	put	it	to	all	of	you	,	what	you	 al 	 ready 	 	know	,	that	no	problem	worth	solving	is	that	simple	.
i	am	 ver 	 y 	 	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	going	to	retire	in	a	world	that	my	 student 	 s 	 	will	run	.
i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	bad	 thing 	 s 	 	to	my	own	future	and	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	when	i	teach	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
i	'm	here	to	tell	you	that	the	way	our	 text 	 book 	 s 	 	--	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	mass	-	 adopt 	 ed 	 	 text 	 book 	 s 	 	--	teach	math	 reason 	 ing 	 	and	patient	problem	solving	,	it	's	 functional 	 ly 	 	 equi 	 valent 	 	to	 turn 	 ing 	 	on	``	two	and	a	half	men	``	and	 call 	 ing 	 	it	a	day	.
in	all	 serious 	 ness 	 	.	here	's	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	from	a	physics	 text 	 book 	 	.
it	 appli 	 es 	 	 equal 	 ly 	 	to	math	.
notice	,	first	of	all	here	,	that	you	have	 exact 	 ly 	 	three	 piece 	 s 	 	of	information	there	,	each	of	which	will	figure	 in 	 to 	 	a	formula	 some 	 where 	 	,	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	which	the	student	will	then	compute	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	in	real	life	.
and	ask	 your 	 self 	 	,	what	problem	have	you	 solve 	 d 	 	,	ever	,	that	was	worth	solving	where	you	 k 	 new 	 	all	of	the	 give 	 n 	 	information	in	advance	;	where	you	did	n't	have	a	 sur 	 plus 	 	of	information	and	you	had	to	filter	it	out	,	or	you	did	n't	have	sufficient	information	and	had	to	go	find	some	.
i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	we	all	agree	that	no	problem	worth	solving	is	like	that	.
and	the	 text 	 book 	 	,	i	think	,	 know 	 s 	 	how	it	's	 ham 	 string 	 ing 	 	 student 	 s 	 
 be 	 cause 	 	,	watch	 th 	 is 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	practice	problem	set	.
when	it	 come 	 s 	 	time	to	do	the	actual	problem	set	,	we	have	 problem 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	right	here	where	we	're	just	 swap 	 ping 	 	out	 number 	 s 	 	and	 tweak 	 ing 	 	the	 con 	 text 	 	a	little	bit	.
and	if	the	student	still	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 recogn 	 ize 	 	the	stamp	 th 	 is 	 	was	 mold 	 ed 	 	from	,	it	 help 	 fully 	 	 explain 	 s 	 	to	you	what	 s 	 ample 	 	problem	you	can	return	to	to	find	the	formula	.
you	could	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	i	mean	 th 	 is 	 	,	pass	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	unit	 with 	 out 	 	 know 	 ing 	 	any	physics	,	just	 know 	 ing 	 	how	to	decode	a	 text 	 book 	 	.	that	's	a	shame	.
so	i	can	 diagnos 	 e 	 	the	problem	a	little	more	 specific 	 ally 	 	in	math	.
here	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	problem	.	i	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	's	about	 defi 	 ning 	 	 steep 	 ness 	 	and	 slop 	 e 	 	using	a	ski	lift	.
but	what	you	have	here	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	four	 separat 	 e 	 	 layer 	 s 	 	,
and	i	'm	 cur 	 ious 	 	which	of	you	can	see	the	four	 separat 	 e 	 	 layer 	 s 	 	and	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	,	how	when	they	're	 compress 	 ed 	 	together	and	 present 	 ed 	 	to	the	student	all	at	once	,	how	that	 create 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 im 	 patient 	 	problem	solving	.
i	'll	define	them	here	:	you	have	the	visual	.
you	 al 	 so 	 	have	the	 mathematic 	 al 	 	structure	,	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 grid 	 s 	 	,	 measure 	 ments 	 	,	 label 	 s 	 	,	 point 	 s 	 	,	 axe 	 s 	 	,	that	sort	of	thing	.
you	have	 sub 	 step 	 s 	 	,	which	all	lead	to	what	we	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	talk	about	:	which	section	is	the	 steep 	 est 	 	.
so	i	hope	you	can	see	.
i	 re 	 ally 	 	hope	you	can	see	how	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	here	is	taking	a	 compel 	 ling 	 	question	,	a	 compel 	 ling 	 	answer	,	but	we	're	 pav 	 ing 	 	a	smooth	,	straight	path	from	one	to	the	other	and	 congratula 	 ting 	 	our	 student 	 s 	 	for	how	well	they	can	step	over	the	small	 crack 	 s 	 	in	the	way	.
that	's	all	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	here	.
so	i	want	to	put	to	you	that	if	we	can	 separat 	 e 	 	these	in	a	different	way	and	build	them	up	with	 student 	 s 	 	,	we	can	have	 every 	 thing 	 	we	're	looking	for	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	patient	problem	solving	.
so	right	here	i	start	with	the	visual	,	and	i	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	ask	the	question	:	which	section	is	the	 steep 	 est 	 	?
and	 th 	 is 	 	 start 	 s 	 	conversation	 be 	 cause 	 	the	visual	is	 create 	 d 	 	in	 s 	 uch 	 	a	way	where	you	can	defend	two	 answer 	 s 	 	.
so	you	get	people	 argu 	 ing 	 	against	each	other	,	friend	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	friend	,	in	 pair 	 s 	 	,	 journal 	 ing 	 	,	 what 	 ever 	 	.
and	then	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	we	 real 	 ize 	 	it	's	 get 	 ting 	 	 annoy 	 ing 	 	to	talk	about	the	 ski 	 er 	 	in	the	lower	left	-	hand	side	of	the	screen	or	the	 ski 	 er 	 	just	above	the	mid	line	.
and	we	 real 	 ize 	 	how	great	would	it	be	if	we	just	had	some	a	,	b	,	c	and	d	 label 	 s 	 	to	talk	about	them	more	 eas 	 ily 	 	.
and	then	 a 	 s 	 	we	start	to	define	what	 do 	 es 	 	 steep 	 ness 	 	mean	,	we	 real 	 ize 	 	it	would	be	nice	to	have	some	 measure 	 ments 	 	to	 re 	 ally 	 	narrow	it	down	,	 specific 	 ally 	 	what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	.
and	then	and	 on 	 ly 	 	then	,	we	throw	down	that	 mathematic 	 al 	 	structure	.
the	math	 serve 	 s 	 	the	conversation	,
the	conversation	 do 	 es 	 	n't	serve	the	math	.
and	at	that	point	,	i	'll	put	it	to	you	that	nine	out	of	10	 class 	 es 	 	are	good	to	go	on	the	whole	 slop 	 e 	 	,	 steep 	 ness 	 	thing	.
but	if	you	need	to	,	your	 student 	 s 	 	can	then	develop	 t 	 hose 	 	 sub 	 step 	 s 	 	together	.
do	you	 guy 	 s 	 	see	how	 th 	 is 	 	,	right	here	,	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	that	--	which	one	 create 	 s 	 	that	patient	problem	solving	,	that	math	 reason 	 ing 	 	?
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	obvious	in	my	practice	,	to	me	.
and	i	'll	yield	the	floor	here	for	a	second	to	einstein	,	who	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	paid	his	 due 	 s 	 	.
he	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	the	 formula 	 tion 	 	of	a	problem	 be 	 ing 	 	so	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	and	yet	in	my	practice	,	in	the	u.s.	here	,	we	just	give	 problem 	 s 	 	to	 student 	 s 	 	;	we	do	n't	involve	them	in	the	 formula 	 tion 	 	of	the	problem	.
so	90	percent	of	what	i	do	with	my	five	 hour 	 s 	 	of	prep	time	per	week	is	to	take	 fair 	 ly 	 	 compel 	 ling 	 	 element 	 s 	 	of	 problem 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	from	my	 text 	 book 	 	and	 re 	 build 	 	them	in	a	way	that	 support 	 s 	 	math	 reason 	 ing 	 	and	patient	problem	solving	.
and	here	's	how	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
i	like	 th 	 is 	 	question	.	it	's	about	a	water	tank	.
the	question	is	:	how	long	will	it	take	you	to	fill	it	up	?
first	 thing 	 s 	 	first	,	we	eliminate	all	the	 sub 	 step 	 s 	 	.
 student 	 s 	 	have	to	develop	 t 	 hose 	 	,
they	have	to	 form 	 ulate 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	.
and	then	notice	that	all	the	information	written	on	there	is	stuff	you	'll	need	.
 non 	 e 	 	of	it	's	a	 distract 	 or 	 	,	so	we	lose	that	.
 student 	 s 	 	need	to	decide	,	``	all	right	,	well	,	 do 	 es 	 	the	height	matter	?	 do 	 es 	 	the	side	of	it	matter	?
 do 	 es 	 	the	color	of	the	 val 	 ve 	 	matter	?	what	 matter 	 s 	 	here	?	``
 s 	 uch 	 	an	 under 	 represent 	 ed 	 	question	in	math	curriculum	.
so	now	we	have	a	water	tank	.
how	long	will	it	take	you	to	fill	it	up	?	and	that	's	it	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	21st	century	and	we	would	love	to	talk	about	the	real	world	on	 it 	 s 	 	own	 term 	 s 	 	,	not	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	line	art	or	clip	art	that	you	so	often	see	in	 text 	 book 	 s 	 	,	we	go	out	and	we	take	a	picture	of	it	.
so	now	we	have	the	real	deal	.
how	long	will	it	take	it	to	fill	it	up	?
and	then	even	better	is	we	take	a	video	,	a	video	of	 some 	 one 	 	 fill 	 ing 	 	it	up	.
and	it	's	 fill 	 ing 	 	up	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	,	 agon 	 izing 	 ly 	 	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	.
it	's	 ted 	 ious 	 	.
 student 	 s 	 	are	looking	at	 the 	 ir 	 	 watch 	 es 	 	,	 roll 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	,	and	they	're	all	 wonder 	 ing 	 	at	some	point	or	 an 	 other 	 	,	``	man	,	how	long	is	it	going	to	take	to	fill	up	?	``
that	's	how	you	know	you	've	 bait 	 ed 	 	the	hook	,	right	?
and	that	question	,	off	 th 	 is 	 	right	here	,	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 f 	 un 	 	for	me	 be 	 cause 	 	,	like	the	intro	,	i	teach	 kid 	 s 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	of	my	 in 	 experience 	 	--	i	teach	the	 kid 	 s 	 	that	are	the	most	 remedi 	 al 	 	,	all	right	?
and	i	've	got	 kid 	 s 	 	who	will	not	join	a	conversation	about	math	 be 	 cause 	 	 some 	 one 	 	else	 ha 	 s 	 	the	formula	;	 some 	 one 	 	else	 know 	 s 	 	how	to	work	the	formula	better	than	me	,
so	i	wo	n't	talk	about	it	.
but	here	,	every	student	is	on	a	level	 play 	 ing 	 	field	of	 intuit 	 ion 	 	.
 every 	 one 	 	's	 fill 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	up	with	water	before	,	so	i	get	 kid 	 s 	 	 answer 	 ing 	 	the	question	,	``	how	long	will	it	take	?	``
i	've	got	 kid 	 s 	 	who	are	 mathematic 	 ally 	 	and	 conversation 	 ally 	 	 intimid 	 ated 	 	 join 	 ing 	 	the	conversation	.
we	put	 name 	 s 	 	on	the	board	,	attach	them	to	 guess 	 es 	 	,	and	 kid 	 s 	 	have	 b 	 ought 	 	in	here	.
and	then	we	follow	the	process	i	've	 de 	 scribed 	 	.
and	the	best	part	here	,	or	one	of	the	better	 part 	 s 	 	is	that	we	do	n't	get	our	answer	from	the	answer	key	in	the	back	of	the	teacher	's	 ed 	 ition 	 	.
we	,	 in 	 stead 	 	,	just	watch	the	end	of	the	movie	.
and	that	's	 terrify 	 ing 	 	,
 be 	 cause 	 	the	 theoretic 	 al 	 	 model 	 s 	 	that	 al 	 ways 	 	work	out	in	the	answer	key	in	the	back	of	a	teacher	's	 ed 	 ition 	 	,	that	's	great	,	but	it	's	 scar 	 y 	 	to	talk	about	 source 	 s 	 	of	error	when	the	 theoretic 	 al 	 	 do 	 es 	 	not	match	up	with	the	practical	.
but	 t 	 hose 	 	 conversation 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	so	 valu 	 able 	 	,	among	the	most	 valu 	 able 	 	.
so	i	'm	here	to	report	some	 re 	 ally 	 	 f 	 un 	 	 game 	 s 	 	with	 student 	 s 	 	who	come	pre	-	 install 	 ed 	 	with	these	viruses	day	one	of	the	class	.
these	are	the	 kid 	 s 	 	who	now	,	one	semester	in	,	i	can	put	 some 	 thing 	 	on	the	board	,	 total 	 ly 	 	new	,	 total 	 ly 	 	foreign	,	and	they	'll	have	a	conversation	about	it	for	three	or	four	 minute 	 s 	 	more	than	they	would	have	at	the	start	of	the	year	,	which	is	just	so	 f 	 un 	 	.
we	're	no	 long 	 er 	 	 a 	 verse 	 	to	word	 problem 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	've	 re 	 defined 	 	what	a	word	problem	is	.
we	're	no	 long 	 er 	 	 intimid 	 ated 	 	by	math	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	 re 	 defi 	 ning 	 	what	math	is	.
 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	lot	of	 f 	 un 	 	.
i	 encourag 	 e 	 	math	 teacher 	 s 	 	i	talk	to	to	use	 multi 	 media 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	the	real	world	 in 	 to 	 	your	 class 	 room 	 	in	high	 re 	 solution 	 	and	full	color	;	to	 encourag 	 e 	 	student	 intuit 	 ion 	 	for	that	level	 play 	 ing 	 	field	;	to	ask	the	 short 	 est 	 	question	you	possibly	can	and	let	 t 	 hose 	 	more	specific	 question 	 s 	 	come	out	in	conversation	;	to	let	 student 	 s 	 	build	the	problem	,	 be 	 cause 	 	einstein	 s 	 aid 	 	so	;	and	to	 final 	 ly 	 	,	in	total	,	just	be	less	 help 	 ful 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 text 	 book 	 	is	 help 	 ing 	 	you	in	all	the	wrong	ways	:
it	's	 buy 	 ing 	 	you	out	of	your	 oblig 	 ation 	 	,	for	patient	problem	solving	and	math	 reason 	 ing 	 	,	to	be	less	 help 	 ful 	 	.
and	why	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	time	to	be	a	math	teacher	right	now	is	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	the	 tool 	 s 	 	to	create	 th 	 is 	 	high	-	quality	curriculum	in	our	front	pocket	.
it	's	 ubiqu 	 it 	 ous 	 	and	 fair 	 ly 	 	cheap	,
and	the	 tool 	 s 	 	to	 distribut 	 e 	 	it	 free 	 ly 	 	under	open	 licens 	 es 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	never	 be 	 en 	 	 cheap 	 er 	 	or	more	 ubiqu 	 it 	 ous 	 	.
i	put	a	video	 s 	 eries 	 	on	my	blog	not	so	long	ago	and	it	got	6,000	 view 	 s 	 	in	two	 week 	 s 	 	.
i	get	 email 	 s 	 	still	from	 teacher 	 s 	 	in	 count 	 ries 	 	i	've	never	 visit 	 ed 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	 w 	 ow 	 	,	 yea 	 h 	 	.	we	had	a	good	conversation	about	that	.
oh	,	and	by	the	way	,	here	's	how	i	made	your	stuff	better	,	``
which	,	 w 	 ow 	 	.	i	put	 th 	 is 	 	problem	on	my	blog	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	:
in	a	 grocer 	 y 	 	store	,	which	line	do	you	get	 in 	 to 	 	,
the	one	that	 ha 	 s 	 	one	cart	and	19	 item 	 s 	 	or	the	line	with	four	 cart 	 s 	 	and	three	,	five	,	two	and	one	 item 	 s 	 	.
and	the	linear	 model 	 ing 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	that	was	some	good	stuff	for	my	 class 	 room 	 	,	but	it	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	got	me	on	``	good	 morn 	 ing 	 	america	``	a	few	 week 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	which	is	just	bizarre	,	right	?
and	from	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	can	 on 	 ly 	 	conclude	that	people	,	not	just	 student 	 s 	 	,	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 hung 	 ry 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	.
math	 make 	 s 	 	sense	of	the	world	.
math	is	the	 vocabul 	 ary 	 	for	your	own	 intuit 	 ion 	 	.
so	i	just	 re 	 ally 	 	 encourag 	 e 	 	you	,	 what 	 ever 	 	your	 s 	 take 	 	is	in	education	--	 whet 	 her 	 	you	're	a	student	,	parent	,	teacher	,	policy	maker	,	 what 	 ever 	 	--	insist	on	better	math	curriculum	.
we	need	more	patient	problem	 solve 	 rs 	 	.	thank	you	.
