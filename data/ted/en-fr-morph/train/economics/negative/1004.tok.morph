i	'm	here	 to 	 day 	 	to	show	my	 photograph 	 s 	 	of	the	lakota	.
 man 	 y 	 	of	you	may	have	heard	of	the	lakota	,	or	at	 l 	 east 	 	the	 large 	 r 	 	group	of	 tribe 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	sioux	.
the	lakota	are	one	of	 man 	 y 	 	 tribe 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 move 	 d 	 	off	 the 	 ir 	 	land	to	prisoner	of	war	 camp 	 s 	 	now	 call 	 ed 	 	 reservation 	 s 	 	.
the	pine	ridge	reservation	,	the	subject	of	 to 	 day 	 	's	slide	show	,	is	 locate 	 d 	 	about	75	 mile 	 s 	 	 south 	 east 	 	of	the	black	 hill 	 s 	 	in	south	dakota	.
it	is	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 refer 	 red 	 	to	 a 	 s 	 	prisoner	of	war	camp	number	334	,	and	it	is	where	the	lakota	now	live	.
now	,	if	any	of	you	have	ever	heard	of	aim	,	the	american	indian	 move 	 ment 	 	,	or	of	russell	 mean 	 s 	 	,	or	leonard	peltier	,	or	of	the	stand	-	off	at	oglala	,	then	you	know	that	pine	ridge	is	ground	zero	for	native	 issue 	 s 	 	in	the	u.s	.
so	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	talk	a	little	bit	 to 	 day 	 	about	my	relationship	with	the	lakota	,	and	that	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	one	for	me	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	if	you	have	n't	 notice 	 d 	 	from	my	skin	color	,	i	'm	white	,	and	that	is	a	huge	 bar 	 rier 	 	on	a	native	reservation	.
you	'll	see	a	lot	of	people	in	my	 photograph 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	and	i	've	 be 	 come 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	close	with	them	,	and	they	've	 welcome 	 d 	 	me	like	family	.
they	've	 call 	 ed 	 	me	``	brother	``	and	``	uncle	``	and	 invit 	 ed 	 	me	 aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	over	five	 year 	 s 	 	.
but	on	pine	ridge	,	i	will	 al 	 ways 	 	be	what	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 was 	 ic 	 hu 	 	,	``	and	``	 was 	 ic 	 hu 	 	``	is	a	lakota	word	that	 mean 	 s 	 	``	non	-	indian	,	``	but	 an 	 other 	 	version	of	 th 	 is 	 	word	 mean 	 s 	 	``	the	one	who	 take 	 s 	 	the	best	meat	for	 him 	 self 	 	.	``
and	that	's	what	i	want	to	focus	on	--	the	one	who	 take 	 s 	 	the	best	part	of	the	meat	.
it	 mean 	 s 	 	 greed 	 y 	 	.
so	take	a	look	around	 th 	 is 	 	 audit 	 orium 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.

and	if	we	look	at	our	 live 	 s 	 	,	we	have	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	taken	the	best	part	of	the	meat	.	so	let	's	look	 to 	 day 	 	at	a	set	of	 photograph 	 s 	 	of	a	people	who	lost	so	that	we	could	gain	,	and	know	that	when	you	see	these	people	's	 face 	 s 	 	that	these	are	not	just	 image 	 s 	 	of	the	lakota	;	they	stand	for	all	 indi 	 genous 	 	people	.
on	 th 	 is 	 	piece	of	paper	is	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	the	way	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	it	from	my	lakota	 friend 	 s 	 	and	family	.

i	'll	begin	in	1824	.
what	is	known	 a 	 s 	 	the	bureau	of	indian	 af 	 fair 	 s 	 	was	 create 	 d 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	war	 depart 	 ment 	 	,	setting	an	early	tone	of	 aggress 	 ion 	 	in	our	 deal 	 ing 	 s 	 	with	the	native	americans	.
1851	:	the	first	 treat 	 y 	 	of	fort	laramie	was	made	,	 clear 	 ly 	 	 mark 	 ing 	 	the	 bound 	 aries 	 	of	the	lakota	nation	.
 accord 	 ing 	 	to	the	 treat 	 y 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 land 	 s 	 	are	a	sovereign	nation	.
if	the	 bound 	 aries 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 treat 	 y 	 	had	held	--	and	there	is	a	legal	 bas 	 is 	 	that	they	should	--	then	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	the	u.s.	would	look	like	 to 	 day 	 	.
10	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	the	homestead	act	,	 sign 	 ed 	 	by	 p 	 resident 	 	lincoln	,	 unleash 	 ed 	 	a	flood	of	white	 settl 	 ers 	 	 in 	 to 	 	native	 land 	 s 	 	.

the	 exec 	 ution 	 	was	 order 	 ed 	 	by	 p 	 resident 	 	lincoln	 on 	 ly 	 	two	 day 	 s 	 	after	he	 sign 	 ed 	 	the	 emancip 	 ation 	 	 pro 	 clam 	 ation 	 	.
1866	:	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	 trans 	 continent 	 al 	 	 rail 	 road 	 	--	a	new	era	.
we	 appropriate 	 d 	 	land	for	 trail 	 s 	 	and	 train 	 s 	 	to	 short 	 cut 	 	through	the	heart	of	the	lakota	nation	.
the	 treat 	 ies 	 	 we 	 re 	 	out	the	window	.
in	 respons 	 e 	 	,	three	 tribe 	 s 	 	led	by	the	lakota	chief	red	cloud	 attack 	 ed 	 	and	 defeat 	 ed 	 	the	u.s.	 arm 	 y 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	over	.
i	want	to	repeat	that	part	.
the	lakota	defeat	the	u.s.	 arm 	 y 	 	.
1868	:	the	second	fort	laramie	 treat 	 y 	 	 clear 	 ly 	 	 guarantee 	 s 	 	the	 sovereign 	 ty 	 	of	the	great	sioux	nation	and	the	lakotas	'	 owner 	 ship 	 	of	the	sacred	black	 hill 	 s 	 	.

we	promise	that	the	powder	river	country	will	 h 	 ence 	 forth 	 	be	closed	to	all	 white 	 s 	 	.
the	 treat 	 y 	 	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	be	a	complete	 vict 	 ory 	 	for	red	cloud	and	the	sioux	.
in	fact	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	war	in	american	 histo 	 ry 	 	in	which	the	government	 negoti 	 ated 	 	a	peace	by	 conce 	 d 	 ing 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	 demand 	 ed 	 	by	the	 ene 	 my 	 	.
1869	:	the	 trans 	 continent 	 al 	 	 rail 	 road 	 	was	 complete 	 d 	 	.

all	western	 in 	 d 	 ians 	 	at	that	point	in	time	 we 	 re 	 	now	 prisoner 	 s 	 	of	war	.
 al 	 so 	 	in	1871	,	we	 end 	 ed 	 	the	time	of	 treat 	 y 	 	-	making	.
the	problem	with	 treat 	 ies 	 	is	they	allow	 tribe 	 s 	 	to	exist	 a 	 s 	 	sovereign	 nation 	 s 	 	,	and	we	ca	n't	have	that	.	we	had	 plan 	 s 	 	.

he	was	 lat 	 er 	 	 kill 	 ed 	 	while	in	 cus 	 to 	 dy 	 	.
1877	is	 al 	 so 	 	the	year	we	found	a	way	to	get	around	the	fort	laramie	 treat 	 ies 	 	.
a	new	 agree 	 ment 	 	was	 present 	 ed 	 	to	sioux	 chief 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 lead 	 ing 	 	men	under	a	campaign	known	 a 	 s 	 	``	sell	or	 starv 	 e 	 	:	``

 t 	 hose 	 	 event 	 s 	 	led	to	a	 domin 	 o 	 	effect	that	 ha 	 s 	 	yet	to	end	.
 a 	 s 	 	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	the	 domin 	 ant 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	may	feel	from	a	massacre	in	1890	,	or	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	broken	 treat 	 ies 	 	150	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	still	have	to	ask	you	the	question	,	how	should	you	feel	about	the	 statistic 	 s 	 	of	 to 	 day 	 	?
what	is	the	 connect 	 ion 	 	between	these	 image 	 s 	 	of	 suffer 	 ing 	 	and	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	that	i	just	read	to	you	?
and	how	much	of	 th 	 is 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	do	you	need	to	own	,	even	?
is	any	of	 th 	 is 	 	your	 respons 	 ibility 	 	 to 	 day 	 	?
i	have	 be 	 en 	 	told	that	there	must	be	 some 	 thing 	 	we	can	do	.
there	must	be	some	call	to	action	.
 be 	 cause 	 	for	so	long	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 stand 	 ing 	 	on	the	 side 	 lines 	 	content	to	be	a	witness	,	just	taking	 photograph 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	solution	 seem 	 s 	 	so	far	in	the	past	,	i	 need 	 ed 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	short	of	a	time	machine	to	access	them	.
the	 suffer 	 ing 	 	of	 indi 	 genous 	 	 people 	 s 	 	is	not	a	simple	issue	to	fix	.
it	's	not	 some 	 thing 	 	 every 	 one 	 	can	get	 be 	 hind 	 	the	way	they	get	 be 	 hind 	 	 help 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 iti 	 	,	or	 end 	 ing 	 	 aid 	 s 	 	,	or	 fight 	 ing 	 	a	famine	.
the	``	fix	,	``	 a 	 s 	 	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	,	may	be	much	more	difficult	for	the	 domin 	 ant 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	than	,	say	,	a	$	50	check	or	a	church	trip	to	paint	some	graffiti	-	 cover 	 ed 	 	 house 	 s 	 	,	or	a	 sub 	 urban 	 	family	 don 	 ating 	 	a	box	of	 clothe 	 s 	 	they	do	n't	even	want	 any 	 more 	 	.
so	where	 do 	 es 	 	that	 leav 	 e 	 	us	?
 shrug 	 ging 	 	our	 shoulder 	 s 	 	in	the	dark	?
the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 continu 	 es 	 	on	a	 dai 	 ly 	 	 bas 	 is 	 	to	 viol 	 ate 	 	the	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	1851	and	1868	fort	laramie	 treat 	 ies 	 	with	the	lakota	.
the	call	to	action	i	 off 	 er 	 	 to 	 day 	 	--	my	ted	wish	--	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	honor	the	 treat 	 ies 	 	.
give	back	the	black	 hill 	 s 	 	.
it	's	not	your	business	what	they	do	with	them	.
