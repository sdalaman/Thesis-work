what	i	'd	like	you	to	do	is	,	just	 re 	 ally 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	is	just	,	sort	of	,	nod	to	the	person	on	your	right	,	and	then	nod	to	the	person	on	your	left	.
now	,	 chance 	 s 	 	are	that	over	the	last	winter	,	if	you	had	 be 	 en 	 	a	 bee 	 hive 	 	,	either	you	or	one	of	the	two	people	you	just	 nod 	 d 	 ed 	 	at	would	have	 di 	 ed 	 	.
now	,	that	's	an	awful	lot	of	bees	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	second	year	in	a	row	we	have	lost	over	30	percent	of	the	 colon 	 ies 	 	,	or	we	estimate	we	've	lost	30	percent	of	the	 colon 	 ies 	 	over	the	winter	.
now	,	that	's	a	lot	,	a	lot	of	bees	,	and	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
and	most	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 loss 	 es 	 	are	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	we	know	.
we	know	that	there	are	these	varroa	 mite 	 s 	 	that	have	 introduc 	 ed 	 	and	 caus 	 ed 	 	a	lot	of	 loss 	 es 	 	,	and	we	 al 	 so 	 	have	 th 	 is 	 	new	 phenomen 	 on 	 	,	which	i	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	last	year	,	 colon 	 y 	 	collapse	 dis 	 order 	 	.
and	here	we	see	a	picture	on	top	of	a	hill	in	central	 val 	 ley 	 	last	december	.
and	 be 	 low 	 	,	you	can	see	all	these	out	 yard 	 s 	 	,	or	 tempor 	 ary 	 	 yard 	 s 	 	,	where	the	 colon 	 ies 	 	are	 br 	 ought 	 	in	 un 	 til 	 	february	,	and	then	they	're	 ship 	 ped 	 	out	to	the	 al 	 mond 	 s 	 	.
and	one	 document 	 ary 	 	writer	,	who	was	here	and	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	two	 month 	 s 	 	after	i	was	here	,	 de 	 scribed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	not	 a 	 s 	 	 bee 	 hive 	 s 	 	but	 a 	 s 	 	a	 grave 	 yard 	 	,	with	these	empty	white	boxes	with	no	bees	left	in	them	.
now	,	i	'm	going	to	sum	up	a	year	's	worth	of	work	in	two	 sentence 	 s 	 	to	say	that	we	have	 be 	 en 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	what	the	cause	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	.
and	what	we	know	is	that	it	's	 a 	 s 	 	if	the	bees	have	caught	a	flu	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	flu	 ha 	 s 	 	 wipe 	 d 	 	through	the	population	of	bees	.
in	some	 case 	 s 	 	,	and	in	fact	in	most	 case 	 s 	 	in	one	year	,	 th 	 is 	 	flu	was	 caus 	 ed 	 	by	a	new	virus	to	us	,	or	 new 	 ly 	 	identified	by	us	,	 call 	 ed 	 	israeli	 a 	 cute 	 	 para 	 lysis 	 	virus	.
it	was	 call 	 ed 	 	that	 be 	 cause 	 	a	guy	in	israel	first	found	it	,	and	he	now	 regret 	 s 	 	 pro 	 found 	 ly 	 	 call 	 ing 	 	it	that	disease	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	of	course	,	there	's	the	 implic 	 ation 	 	.
but	we	think	 th 	 is 	 	virus	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	 ubiqu 	 it 	 ous 	 	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	clear	that	the	bees	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	catch	other	viruses	or	other	 flu 	 s 	 	,	and	so	the	question	we	're	still	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	with	,	and	the	question	that	 keep 	 s 	 	us	up	at	night	,	is	why	have	the	bees	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 be 	 come 	 	so	susceptible	to	 th 	 is 	 	flu	,	and	why	are	they	so	susceptible	to	these	other	 disease 	 s 	 	?
and	we	do	n't	have	the	answer	to	that	yet	,	and	we	 s 	 pend 	 	a	lot	of	time	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	that	out	.
we	think	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	it	's	a	combination	of	 factor 	 s 	 	.
we	know	from	the	work	of	a	 ver 	 y 	 	large	and	dynamic	 work 	 ing 	 	team	that	,	you	know	,	we	're	 find 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	different	 pest 	 icide 	 s 	 	in	the	hive	,	and	 surprising 	 ly 	 	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	the	 health 	 iest 	 	 hive 	 s 	 	have	the	most	 pest 	 icide 	 s 	 	.	and	so	we	discover	all	these	 ver 	 y 	 	strange	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	ca	n't	begin	to	understand	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	 open 	 s 	 	up	the	whole	idea	of	looking	at	 colon 	 y 	 	health	.
now	of	course	,	if	you	lose	a	lot	of	 colon 	 ies 	 	,	 beekee 	 per 	 s 	 	can	replace	them	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
and	that	's	why	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	 re 	 cover 	 	from	a	lot	of	loss	.
if	we	lost	one	in	every	three	 cow 	 s 	 	in	the	winter	,	you	know	,	the	national	guard	would	be	out	.
but	what	 beekee 	 per 	 s 	 	can	do	is	,	if	they	have	one	 surviv 	 ing 	 	 colon 	 y 	 	,	they	can	split	that	 colon 	 y 	 	in	two	.
and	then	the	one	half	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	a	 que 	 en 	 	,	they	can	buy	a	 que 	 en 	 	.
it	 come 	 s 	 	in	the	mail	;	it	can	come	from	australia	or	hawaii	or	florida	,	and	you	can	 introduc 	 e 	 	that	 que 	 en 	 	.
and	in	fact	,	america	was	the	first	country	that	ever	did	mail	-	 deliver 	 y 	 	 que 	 en 	 s 	 	and	in	fact	,	it	's	part	of	the	 post 	 al 	 	code	that	you	have	to	deliver	 que 	 en 	 s 	 	by	mail	in	order	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	we	have	 en 	 ough 	 	bees	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	.
if	you	do	n't	just	want	a	 que 	 en 	 	,	you	can	buy	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	a	three	-	pound	package	of	bees	,	which	 come 	 s 	 	in	the	mail	,	and	of	course	,	the	 post 	 al 	 	 off 	 ice 	 	is	 al 	 ways 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 concern 	 ed 	 	when	they	get	,	you	know	,	your	three	-	pound	 package 	 s 	 	of	bees	.
and	you	can	install	 th 	 is 	 	in	your	hive	and	replace	that	dead	-	out	.
so	it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	 beekee 	 per 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	good	at	 re 	 placing 	 	dead	-	 out 	 s 	 	,	and	so	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	cover	 t 	 hose 	 	 loss 	 es 	 	.
so	even	 th 	 ough 	 	we	've	lost	30	percent	of	the	 colon 	 ies 	 	every	year	,	the	same	number	of	 colon 	 ies 	 	have	 exist 	 ed 	 	in	the	country	,	at	about	2.4	million	 colon 	 ies 	 	.
now	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 loss 	 es 	 	are	tragic	on	 man 	 y 	 	 front 	 s 	 	,	and	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 front 	 s 	 	is	for	the	 beekee 	 per 	 	.
and	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	talk	about	 beekee 	 per 	 s 	 	first	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 beekee 	 per 	 s 	 	are	among	the	most	 fasci 	 nating 	 	people	you	'll	ever	meet	.
if	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	group	of	 beekee 	 per 	 s 	 	,	you	would	have	 every 	 one 	 	from	the	card	-	 carry 	 ing 	 	nra	member	who	's	,	you	know	,	live	free	or	die	,	to	the	,	you	know	,	the	self	-	 express 	 ed 	 	 quirk 	 y 	 	san	francisco	 back 	 yard 	 	pig	 farm 	 er 	 	.
and	you	get	all	of	these	people	in	the	same	room	,	and	they	're	all	 engag 	 ed 	 	and	they	're	 get 	 ting 	 	 a 	 long 	 	,	and	they	're	all	there	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 pass 	 ion 	 	for	bees	.
now	,	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	part	of	that	community	which	are	the	commercial	 beekee 	 per 	 s 	 	,	the	 one 	 s 	 	who	make	 the 	 ir 	 	livelihood	from	 beekee 	 ping 	 	 al 	 one 	 	.
and	these	tend	to	be	some	of	the	most	 in 	 dependent 	 	,	 ten 	 acious 	 	,	intuitive	,	you	know	,	 invent 	 ive 	 	people	you	will	ever	meet	.
they	're	just	 fasci 	 nating 	 	.	and	they	're	like	that	all	over	the	world	.
i	had	the	privilege	of	 work 	 ing 	 	in	 ha 	 iti 	 	just	for	two	 week 	 s 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	.
and	 ha 	 iti 	 	,	if	you	've	ever	 be 	 en 	 	there	,	is	just	a	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	.
i	mean	,	there	may	be	100	 explan 	 ations 	 	for	why	 ha 	 iti 	 	is	the	 imp 	 over 	 ish 	 ed 	 	nation	it	is	,	but	there	is	no	excuse	to	see	that	sort	of	squalor	.
but	you	meet	 th 	 is 	 	 beekee 	 per 	 	,	and	i	met	 th 	 is 	 	 beekee 	 per 	 	here	,	and	he	is	one	of	the	most	 knowledge 	 able 	 	 beekee 	 per 	 s 	 	i	've	ever	met	.
no	 form 	 al 	 	education	,	but	 ver 	 y 	 	 knowledge 	 able 	 	.
we	 need 	 ed 	 	 bees 	 wax 	 	for	a	project	we	 we 	 re 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	;	he	was	so	 cap 	 able 	 	,	he	was	able	to	render	the	 nic 	 est 	 	block	of	 bees 	 wax 	 	i	have	ever	 s 	 een 	 	from	cow	dung	,	tin	 can 	 s 	 	and	his	veil	,	which	he	used	 a 	 s 	 	a	 screen 	 ing 	 	,	right	in	 th 	 is 	 	meadow	.	and	so	that	 ing 	 en 	 u 	 ity 	 	is	inspiring	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	have	dave	hackenberg	,	who	is	the	 post 	 er 	 	child	of	ccd	.
he	's	the	one	who	first	identified	 th 	 is 	 	condition	and	raised	the	alarm	 bell 	 s 	 	.
and	he	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	these	 truck 	 s 	 	,	and	he	's	 move 	 d 	 	these	bees	up	and	down	the	coast	.
and	a	lot	of	people	talk	about	 truck 	 s 	 	and	moving	bees	,	and	that	 be 	 ing 	 	bad	,	but	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	that	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
the	ancient	egyptians	used	to	move	bees	up	and	down	the	nile	on	 raft 	 s 	 	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	a	movable	bee	force	is	not	new	at	all	.
and	one	of	our	real	 worri 	 es 	 	with	 colon 	 y 	 	collapse	 dis 	 order 	 	is	the	fact	that	it	 cost 	 s 	 	so	much	money	to	replace	 t 	 hose 	 	dead	-	out	 colon 	 ies 	 	.
and	you	can	do	that	one	year	in	a	row	,	you	may	be	able	to	do	it	two	 year 	 s 	 	in	a	row	.
but	if	you	're	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	50	percent	to	80	percent	of	your	 colon 	 ies 	 	,	you	ca	n't	 surviv 	 e 	 	three	 year 	 s 	 	in	a	row	.	and	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	segment	of	our	industry	.
and	that	's	 import 	 ant 	 	for	 man 	 y 	 	 front 	 s 	 	,	and	one	of	them	is	 be 	 cause 	 	of	that	culture	that	's	in	 agricultur 	 e 	 	.
and	these	 migr 	 atory 	 	 beekee 	 per 	 s 	 	are	the	last	 nomad 	 s 	 	of	america	.
you	know	,	they	pick	up	 the 	 ir 	 	 hive 	 s 	 	;	they	move	 the 	 ir 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	once	or	twice	in	a	year	.
and	if	you	look	at	florida	,	in	dade	city	,	florida	,	that	's	where	all	the	pennsylvania	 beekee 	 per 	 s 	 	go	.
and	then	20	 mile 	 s 	 	down	the	road	is	groveland	,	and	that	's	where	all	the	wisconsin	 beekee 	 per 	 s 	 	go	.
and	if	you	're	ever	in	central	 val 	 ley 	 	in	february	,	you	go	to	 th 	 is 	 	caf√©	at	10	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	kathy	and	kate	's	.
and	that	's	where	all	the	 beekee 	 per 	 s 	 	come	after	a	night	of	moving	bees	 in 	 to 	 	the	 al 	 mond 	 	 grove 	 s 	 	.
they	all	have	 the 	 ir 	 	 break 	 fast 	 	and	complain	about	 every 	 one 	 	right	there	.	and	it	's	a	great	experience	,	and	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 encourag 	 e 	 	you	to	drop	in	at	that	 din 	 er 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	that	time	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	 quit 	 e 	 	essential	american	experience	.
and	we	see	these	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	,	these	 nomad 	 ic 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	,	you	know	,	father	to	son	,	father	to	son	,	and	these	 guy 	 s 	 	are	 hurt 	 ing 	 	.
and	they	're	not	people	who	like	to	ask	for	help	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	they	are	the	most	 help 	 ful 	 	people	ever	.
if	there	's	one	guy	who	 lose 	 s 	 	all	his	bees	 be 	 cause 	 	of	a	truck	 over 	 haul 	 	,	 every 	 one 	 	 pitch 	 es 	 	in	and	 give 	 s 	 	20	 hive 	 s 	 	to	help	him	replace	 t 	 hose 	 	lost	 colon 	 ies 	 	.
and	so	,	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	dynamic	,	and	i	think	,	historic	and	 excit 	 ing 	 	community	to	be	 involve 	 d 	 	with	.
of	course	,	the	real	 import 	 ance 	 	for	bees	is	not	the	honey	.
and	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	i	 high 	 ly 	 	 encourag 	 e 	 	you	,	all	use	honey	.
i	mean	,	it	's	the	most	 ethic 	 al 	 	 sweet 	 en 	 er 	 	,	and	you	know	,	it	's	a	dynamic	and	 f 	 un 	 	 sweet 	 en 	 er 	 	.
but	we	estimate	that	about	one	in	three	 bite 	 s 	 	of	food	we	eat	is	 direct 	 ly 	 	or	 in 	 direct 	 ly 	 	 pollinat 	 ed 	 	by	 honey 	 bees 	 	.
now	,	i	want	to	just	 illustr 	 ate 	 	that	in	the	fact	that	if	we	look	at	the	 break 	 fast 	 	i	had	 yester 	 day 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	--	a	little	cranberry	juice	,	some	 fruit 	 s 	 	,	some	granola	,	i	should	have	had	whole	wheat	bread	,	i	 real 	 ized 	 	,	but	you	know	,	jam	on	my	wonderbread	,	and	some	coffee	--	and	had	we	taken	out	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	,	--	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	the	 al 	 mond 	 s 	 	i	was	n't	going	to	pick	out	from	the	granola	--	if	we	had	taken	out	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	the	bees	had	 in 	 direct 	 ly 	 	or	 direct 	 ly 	 	 pollinat 	 ed 	 	,	we	would	n't	have	much	on	our	plate	.
so	if	we	did	not	have	bees	,	it	's	not	like	we	would	 starv 	 e 	 	,	but	 clear 	 ly 	 	our	diet	would	be	 diminish 	 ed 	 	.
it	's	 s 	 aid 	 	that	for	bees	,	the	flower	is	the	fountain	of	life	,	and	for	 flower 	 s 	 	bees	are	the	 messenger 	 s 	 	of	love	.
and	that	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	great	 express 	 ion 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	,	bees	are	the	 s 	 ex 	 	 work 	 ers 	 	for	 flower 	 s 	 	.	they	are	,	you	know	--	they	get	paid	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 service 	 s 	 	.
they	get	paid	by	 poll 	 en 	 	and	nectar	,	to	move	that	male	 s 	 perm 	 	,	the	 poll 	 en 	 	,	from	flower	to	flower	.	and	there	are	 flower 	 s 	 	that	are	self	-	 infer 	 tile 	 	.	that	 mean 	 s 	 	they	ca	n't	--	the	 poll 	 en 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	bloom	ca	n't	 fertil 	 ize 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
so	in	an	apple	 orc 	 hard 	 	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	you	'll	have	 row 	 s 	 	of	10	 apple 	 s 	 	of	one	 varie 	 ty 	 	,	and	then	you	have	 an 	 other 	 	apple	tree	that	's	a	different	type	of	 poll 	 en 	 	.
and	bees	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 faith 	 ful 	 	.
when	they	're	out	 pollinat 	 ing 	 	or	 gather 	 ing 	 	 poll 	 en 	 	from	one	flower	,	they	stay	to	that	crop	 exclusive 	 ly 	 	,	in	order	to	help	generate	.
and	of	course	,	they	're	made	to	carry	 th 	 is 	 	 poll 	 en 	 	.
they	build	up	a	static	electric	charge	and	the	 poll 	 en 	 	 jump 	 s 	 	on	them	and	 help 	 s 	 	spread	that	 poll 	 en 	 	from	bloom	to	bloom	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	 honey 	 bees 	 	are	a	 minor 	 ity 	 	.
 honey 	 bees 	 	are	not	native	to	america	;	they	 we 	 re 	 	 introduc 	 ed 	 	with	the	 colonial 	 ists 	 	.
and	there	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	more	species	of	bees	than	there	are	 mammal 	 s 	 	and	 bird 	 s 	 	 combine 	 d 	 	.
in	pennsylvania	 al 	 one 	 	,	we	have	 be 	 en 	 	 survey 	 ing 	 	bees	for	150	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 intens 	 e 	 ly 	 	in	the	last	three	 year 	 s 	 	.
we	have	identified	over	400	species	of	bees	in	pennsylvania	.
thirty	-	two	species	have	not	 be 	 en 	 	identified	or	found	in	the	state	since	1950	.
now	,	that	could	be	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	n't	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 ampl 	 ing 	 	right	,	but	it	 do 	 es 	 	,	i	think	,	suggest	that	 some 	 thing 	 	's	wrong	with	the	 pollinat 	 or 	 	force	.	and	these	bees	are	 fasci 	 nating 	 	.
we	have	 bumble 	 bees 	 	on	the	top	.
and	 bumble 	 bees 	 	are	what	we	call	 eu 	 social 	 	:	they	're	not	 tru 	 ly 	 	social	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	the	 que 	 en 	 	is	,	over	winter	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	have	the	sweat	bees	,	and	these	are	little	 gem 	 s 	 	 fly 	 ing 	 	around	.
they	're	like	 tin 	 y 	 	little	flies	and	they	fly	around	.
and	then	you	have	 an 	 other 	 	type	of	bee	,	which	we	call	 klepto 	 parasit 	 es 	 	,	which	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 f 	 ancy 	 	way	of	 say 	 ing 	 	,	bad	-	minded	,	 murder 	 ing 	 	--	what	's	the	word	i	'm	looking	for	?	 murder 	 ing 	 	--	audience	:	bee	?
dennis	vanengelsdorp	:	bee	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	 thank 	 s 	 	.
what	these	bees	do	is	,	they	 s 	 it 	 	there	.	these	 so 	 lit 	 ary 	 	bees	,	they	drill	a	hole	in	the	ground	or	drill	a	hole	in	a	branch	,	and	they	collect	 poll 	 en 	 	and	make	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	ball	,	and	they	lay	an	egg	on	it	.
well	,	these	bees	hang	out	at	that	hole	,	and	they	wait	for	that	mother	to	fly	away	,	they	go	in	,	eat	the	egg	,	and	lay	 the 	 ir 	 	own	egg	there	.	so	they	do	n't	do	any	work	.
and	so	,	in	fact	,	if	you	know	you	have	these	 klepto 	 parasit 	 ic 	 	bees	,	you	know	that	your	environment	is	 health 	 y 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	top	-	of	-	the	-	food	-	chain	bees	.
and	in	fact	,	there	is	now	a	red	list	of	 pollinat 	 ors 	 	that	we	're	 worri 	 ed 	 	have	 disappear 	 ed 	 	,	and	on	top	of	that	list	are	a	lot	of	these	 klepto 	 parasit 	 es 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	these	 bumble 	 bees 	 	.
and	in	fact	,	if	you	 guy 	 s 	 	live	on	the	west	coast	,	go	to	these	 web 	 s 	 ites 	 	here	,	and	they	're	 re 	 ally 	 	looking	for	people	to	look	for	some	of	these	 bumble 	 bees 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	think	some	have	gone	extinct	.	or	some	,	the	population	 ha 	 s 	 	 decline 	 d 	 	.
and	so	it	's	not	just	 honey 	 bees 	 	that	are	in	trouble	,	but	we	do	n't	understand	these	native	 pollinat 	 ors 	 	or	all	 t 	 hose 	 	other	 part 	 s 	 	of	our	community	.
and	of	course	,	bees	are	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	factor	here	.
there	are	other	 animal 	 s 	 	that	 pollinat 	 e 	 	,	like	 bat 	 s 	 	,	and	 bat 	 s 	 	are	in	trouble	too	.
and	i	'm	glad	i	'm	a	bee	man	and	not	a	bat	man	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	no	money	to	research	the	bat	 problem 	 s 	 	.
and	 bat 	 s 	 	are	 dy 	 ing 	 	at	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	rate	.
white	-	nose	syndrome	 ha 	 s 	 	 wipe 	 d 	 	out	 population 	 s 	 	of	 bat 	 s 	 	.
if	there	's	a	cave	in	new	york	that	had	15,000	 bat 	 s 	 	in	it	,	and	there	are	1,000	left	.	that	's	like	san	francisco	 be 	 coming 	 	the	population	of	half	of	 th 	 is 	 	 count 	 y 	 	in	three	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	so	that	's	 in 	 credible 	 	.	and	there	's	no	money	to	do	that	.	but	i	'm	glad	to	say	that	i	think	we	know	the	cause	of	all	these	 condition 	 s 	 	,	and	that	cause	is	ndd	:	nature	 defici 	 t 	 	 dis 	 order 	 	.
and	that	is	that	i	think	that	what	we	have	in	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	is	,	we	 for 	 got 	 	our	 connect 	 ion 	 	with	nature	.
and	i	think	if	we	 re 	 connect 	 	to	nature	,	we	'll	be	able	to	have	the	 resource 	 s 	 	and	that	interest	to	solve	these	 problem 	 s 	 	.
and	i	think	that	there	is	an	easy	cure	for	ndd	.
and	that	is	,	make	 meadow 	 s 	 	and	not	 lawn 	 s 	 	.
and	i	think	we	have	lost	our	 connect 	 ion 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	way	of	 re 	 connect 	 ing 	 	to	our	environment	.
i	've	had	the	privilege	of	living	by	a	meadow	for	the	last	little	while	,	and	it	is	 terr 	 ibly 	 	 engag 	 ing 	 	.
and	if	we	look	at	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 lawn 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	tragic	.
it	used	to	be	,	two	,	three	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	that	a	lawn	was	a	symbol	of	 pre 	 stig 	 e 	 	,	and	so	it	was	 on 	 ly 	 	the	 ver 	 y 	 	rich	that	could	keep	these	green	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 desert 	 s 	 	:	they	're	 total 	 ly 	 	 steril 	 e 	 	.
americans	 s 	 pent 	 	,	in	2001	--	11	percent	of	all	 pest 	 icide 	 	use	was	 d 	 one 	 	on	 lawn 	 s 	 	.
five	percent	of	our	 green 	 house 	 	 gas 	 es 	 	are	 produce 	 d 	 	by	 mow 	 ing 	 	our	 lawn 	 s 	 	.
and	so	it	's	 in 	 credible 	 	the	amount	of	 resource 	 s 	 	we	've	 s 	 pent 	 	 keep 	 ing 	 	our	 lawn 	 s 	 	,	which	are	these	 use 	 less 	 	 bio 	 system 	 s 	 	.
and	so	we	need	to	 re 	 think 	 	 th 	 is 	 	idea	.
in	fact	,	you	know	,	the	white	house	used	to	have	sheep	in	front	in	order	to	help	fund	the	war	effort	in	world	war	i	,	which	 prob 	 ably 	 	is	not	a	bad	idea	;	it	would	n't	be	a	bad	idea	.
i	want	to	say	 th 	 is 	 	not	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	 oppos 	 ed 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	to	 mow 	 ing 	 	 lawn 	 s 	 	.
i	think	that	there	is	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	some	advantage	to	 keep 	 ing 	 	 lawn 	 s 	 	at	a	 limit 	 ed 	 	scale	,	and	i	think	we	're	 encourag 	 ed 	 	to	do	that	.
but	i	 al 	 so 	 	want	to	reinforce	some	of	the	 idea 	 s 	 	we	've	heard	here	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	meadow	or	living	by	a	meadow	is	 transform 	 ation 	 al 	 	.
that	it	is	 amaz 	 ing 	 	that	 connect 	 ion 	 	we	can	have	with	what	's	there	.
these	 milk 	 weed 	 	 plant 	 s 	 	have	grown	up	in	my	meadow	over	the	last	four	 year 	 s 	 	.	add	to	watch	the	different	 plant 	 s 	 	,	or	 insect 	 s 	 	,	that	come	to	these	 flower 	 s 	 	,	to	watch	that	--	and	we	've	heard	about	,	you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	relationship	you	can	have	with	wine	,	 th 	 is 	 	companion	you	can	have	 a 	 s 	 	it	 mature 	 s 	 	and	 a 	 s 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	these	different	 fragr 	 ance 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	companion	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	relationship	that	never	 d 	 ries 	 	up	.
you	never	run	out	of	that	companion	 a 	 s 	 	you	drink	 th 	 is 	 	wine	,	too	.
and	i	 encourag 	 e 	 	you	to	look	at	that	.
now	,	not	all	of	us	have	 meadow 	 s 	 	,	or	 lawn 	 s 	 	that	we	can	convert	,	and	so	you	can	 al 	 ways 	 	,	of	course	,	grow	a	meadow	in	a	pot	.
bees	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	,	can	be	the	 gate 	 way 	 	to	,	you	know	,	other	 thing 	 s 	 	.
so	i	'm	not	 say 	 ing 	 	that	you	should	plant	a	meadow	of	pot	,	but	a	pot	in	a	meadow	.
but	you	can	 al 	 so 	 	have	 th 	 is 	 	great	community	of	city	or	building	-	top	 beekee 	 per 	 s 	 	,	these	 beekee 	 per 	 s 	 	that	live	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	in	paris	where	these	 beekee 	 per 	 s 	 	live	.
and	 every 	 one 	 	should	open	a	 bee 	 hive 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	the	most	 amaz 	 ing 	 	,	 in 	 credible 	 	thing	.
and	if	we	want	to	cure	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	of	ndd	,	or	nature	 defici 	 t 	 	 dis 	 order 	 	,	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	great	way	of	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
get	a	 bee 	 hive 	 	and	grow	a	meadow	,	and	watch	that	life	come	back	 in 	 to 	 	your	life	.
and	so	with	that	,	i	think	that	what	we	can	do	,	if	we	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	can	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	our	future	--	our	more	perfect	future	--	 include 	 s 	 	 beekee 	 per 	 s 	 	and	it	 include 	 s 	 	bees	and	it	 include 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 meadow 	 s 	 	.
and	that	journey	--	that	journey	of	 transform 	 ation 	 	that	 occur 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	grow	your	meadow	and	 a 	 s 	 	you	keep	your	bees	or	you	watch	 t 	 hose 	 	native	bees	there	--	is	an	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	one	.
and	i	hope	that	you	experience	it	and	i	hope	you	tell	me	about	it	one	day	.
so	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	for	 be 	 ing 	 	here	.	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
