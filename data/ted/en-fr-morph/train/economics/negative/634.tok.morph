the	public	debate	about	 architect 	 ure 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	often	just	 stay 	 s 	 	on	 contempl 	 ating 	 	the	final	result	,	the	 architect 	 ural 	 	object	.
is	the	 lat 	 est 	 	tower	in	london
a	 gh 	 er 	 kin 	 	or	a	sausage	or	a	 s 	 ex 	 	tool	?
so	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	if	we	could	invent	a	format	that	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	tell	the	 st 	 ories 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	the	 project 	 s 	 	,
 may 	 be 	 	 comb 	 in 	 ing 	 	 image 	 s 	 	and	 draw 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	 word 	 s 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	sort	of	tell	 st 	 ories 	 	about	 architect 	 ure 	 	.
and	we	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	we	did	n't	have	to	invent	it	,	it	 al 	 ready 	 	 exist 	 ed 	 	in	the	form	of	a	 com 	 ic 	 	book	.
so	we	 bas 	 ically 	 	 cop 	 ied 	 	the	format	of	the	 com 	 ic 	 	book
to	 actual 	 ly 	 	tell	the	 st 	 ories 	 	of	 be 	 hind 	 	the	 scene 	 s 	 	,	how	our	 project 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	evolve	through	 adapt 	 ation 	 	and	improvisation	.
sort	of	through	the	turmoil	and	the	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	and	the	 incident 	 s 	 	of	the	real	world	.
we	call	 th 	 is 	 	 com 	 ic 	 	book	``	 y 	 es 	 	is	more	,	``
which	is	 obvious 	 ly 	 	a	sort	of	evolution	of	the	 idea 	 s 	 	of	some	of	our	heroes	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	it	's	mies	van	der	rohe	's	less	is	more	.
he	 trigger 	 ed 	 	the	 modern 	 ist 	 	revolution	.
after	him	 follow 	 ed 	 	the	post	-	modern	counter	-	revolution	,
robert	venturi	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	less	is	a	bore	.	``	after	him	,	philip	johnson	sort	of	 introduc 	 ed 	 	you	could	say	 promisc 	 u 	 ity 	 	,	or	at	 l 	 east 	 	 open 	 ness 	 	to	new	 idea 	 s 	 	with	,	``	i	am	a	 who 	 re 	 	.	``
 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	obama	 ha 	 s 	 	 introduc 	 ed 	 	 optim 	 ism 	 	at	a	sort	of	time	of	global	financial	crisis	.
and	what	we	'd	like	to	say	with	``	 y 	 es 	 	is	more	``	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	question	 th 	 is 	 	idea	that	the	 architect 	 ural 	 	avant	-	garde	is	 al 	 most 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 negative 	 ly 	 	defined	,	 a 	 s 	 	who	or	what	we	are	against	.
the	cliche	of	the	radical	architect	is	the	sort	of	 ang 	 ry 	 	young	man	 rebel 	 ling 	 	against	the	 establish 	 ment 	 	.
or	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	the	 mis 	 under 	 stood 	 	 gen 	 ius 	 	,	 frust 	 rated 	 	that	the	world	 do 	 es 	 	n't	fit	in	with	his	or	her	 idea 	 s 	 	.
 ra 	 ther 	 	than	revolution	,	we	're	much	more	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	evolution	,
 th 	 is 	 	idea	that	 thing 	 s 	 	 gradu 	 ally 	 	evolve	by	 adapt 	 ing 	 	and	 improv 	 is 	 ing 	 	to	the	 change 	 s 	 	of	the	world	.
in	fact	,	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	think	that	darwin	is	one	of	the	people	who	best	 explain 	 s 	 	our	design	process	.
his	famous	 evolution 	 ary 	 	tree	could	 al 	 most 	 	be	a	 dia 	 gram 	 	of	the	way	we	work	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	a	project	 evolve 	 s 	 	through	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 generation 	 s 	 	of	design	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
at	each	 meet 	 ing 	 	,	there	's	way	too	 man 	 y 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	.
 on 	 ly 	 	the	best	 one 	 s 	 	can	 surviv 	 e 	 	.
and	through	a	process	of	 architect 	 ural 	 	 s 	 election 	 	,	we	might	 choos 	 e 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	model
or	we	might	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	functional	model	.
we	mate	them	.	they	have	sort	of	 mut 	 ant 	 	 off 	 spring 	 	.
and	through	these	sort	of	 generation 	 s 	 	of	design	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	we	 arriv 	 e 	 	at	a	design	.
a	 ver 	 y 	 	 liter 	 al 	 	way	of	 show 	 ing 	 	it	is	a	project	we	did	for	a	library	and	a	hotel	in	copenhagen	.
the	design	process	was	 re 	 ally 	 	tough	,	 al 	 most 	 	like	a	struggle	for	 surviv 	 al 	 	,
but	 gradu 	 ally 	 	an	idea	 evolv 	 ed 	 	:
 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	idea	of	a	rational	tower	that	 melt 	 s 	 	together	with	the	 surround 	 ing 	 	city	,	sort	of	 expand 	 ing 	 	the	public	space	onto	what	we	refer	to	 a 	 s 	 	a	scandinavian	version	of	the	spanish	 step 	 s 	 	in	rome	,
but	sort	of	public	on	the	 out 	 side 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	on	the	 in 	 side 	 	,	with	the	library	.
but	darwin	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 on 	 ly 	 	explain	the	evolution	of	a	single	idea	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	a	 sub 	 species 	 	 branch 	 es 	 	off	.
and	 quit 	 e 	 	often	we	 s 	 it 	 	in	a	design	 meet 	 ing 	 	and	we	discover	that	there	is	 th 	 is 	 	great	idea	.	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	work	in	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 text 	 	.
but	for	 an 	 other 	 	client	in	 an 	 other 	 	culture	,	it	could	 re 	 ally 	 	be	the	right	answer	to	a	different	question	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	,	we	never	throw	 any 	 thing 	 	out	.
we	keep	our	 off 	 ice 	 	 al 	 most 	 	like	an	 archiv 	 e 	 	of	 architect 	 ural 	 	 bio 	 divers 	 ity 	 	.
you	never	know	when	you	might	need	it	.
and	what	i	'd	like	to	do	now	,	in	an	act	of	warp	-	speed	 story 	 tell 	 ing 	 	,	is	tell	the	story	of	how	two	 project 	 s 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	by	 adapt 	 ing 	 	and	 improv 	 is 	 ing 	 	to	the	 happen 	 stance 	 	of	the	world	.
the	first	story	 start 	 s 	 	last	year	when	we	went	to	shanghai	to	do	the	 com 	 petition 	 	for	the	danish	national	pavilion	for	the	world	expo	in	2010	.
and	we	saw	 th 	 is 	 	guy	,	haibao	.
he	's	the	 m 	 ascot 	 	of	the	expo	,
and	he	 look 	 s 	 	 strange 	 ly 	 	familiar	.
in	fact	he	 look 	 ed 	 	like	a	building	we	had	designed	for	a	hotel	in	the	north	of	sweden	.
when	we	 submit 	 ted 	 	it	for	the	swedish	 com 	 petition 	 	we	thought	it	was	a	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	scheme	,	but	it	did	n't	 exact 	 ly 	 	look	like	 some 	 thing 	 	from	the	north	of	sweden	.
the	swedish	jury	did	n't	think	so	either	.	so	we	lost	.
but	then	we	had	a	 meet 	 ing 	 	with	a	chinese	 business 	 man 	 	who	saw	our	design	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 w 	 ow 	 	,	that	's	the	chinese	character	for	the	word	'	people	.	'	``
so	,	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	you	write	``	people	,	``	 a 	 s 	 	in	the	people	's	 re 	 public 	 	of	 chin 	 a 	 	.
we	even	double	 check 	 ed 	 	.
and	at	the	same	time	,	we	got	 invit 	 ed 	 	to	exhibit	at	the	shanghai	creative	industry	week	.
so	we	thought	like	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	too	much	of	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	,
so	we	 hire 	 d 	 	a	 fe 	 ng 	 	shui	master	.
we	 scale 	 d 	 	the	building	up	three	 time 	 s 	 	to	chinese	 proportion 	 s 	 	,	and	went	to	 chin 	 a 	 	.
so	the	people	's	building	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	 call 	 ed 	 	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	our	two	 interpret 	 ers 	 	,	sort	of	 read 	 ing 	 	the	 architect 	 ure 	 	.
it	went	on	the	cover	of	the	wen	wei	po	 news 	 paper 	 	,
which	got	mr.	liangyu	chen	,	the	mayor	of	shanghai	,	to	visit	the	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	.
and	we	had	the	chance	to	explain	the	project	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	shanghai	is	the	city	in	the	world	with	most	 sky 	 scrap 	 ers 	 	,	``
but	to	him	it	was	 a 	 s 	 	if	the	 connect 	 ion 	 	to	the	 root 	 s 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	cut	over	.
and	with	the	people	's	building	,	he	saw	an	 architect 	 ure 	 	that	could	bridge	the	gap	between	the	ancient	 wis 	 dom 	 	of	 chin 	 a 	 	and	the	 progress 	 ive 	 	future	of	 chin 	 a 	 	.
so	we	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 pro 	 found 	 ly 	 	 agree 	 d 	 	with	him	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	mr.	chen	is	now	in	 pri 	 son 	 	for	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	.
but	like	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	haibao	 look 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	familiar	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	chinese	character	for	``	people	.	``
and	they	chose	 th 	 is 	 	 m 	 ascot 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	theme	of	the	expo	is	``	better	city	,	better	life	.	``
 sustain 	 ability 	 	.
and	we	thought	,	 sustain 	 ability 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	grown	 in 	 to 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	neo	-	protestant	idea	that	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	hurt	in	order	to	do	good	.
you	know	,	you	're	not	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	take	long	,	warm	 shower 	 s 	 	.
you	're	not	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	fly	on	 holi 	 day 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	bad	for	the	environment	.
 gradu 	 ally 	 	,	you	get	 th 	 is 	 	idea	that	 sustain 	 able 	 	life	is	less	 f 	 un 	 	than	normal	life	.
so	we	thought	that	 may 	 be 	 	it	could	be	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	focus	on	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	where	a	 sustain 	 able 	 	city	 actual 	 ly 	 	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	the	quality	of	life	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	what	could	denmark	possibly	show	 chin 	 a 	 	that	would	be	relevant	?
you	know	,	it	's	one	of	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	in	the	world	,	one	of	the	 small 	 est 	 	.
 chin 	 a 	 	 symbol 	 ized 	 	by	the	dragon	.
denmark	,	we	have	a	national	bird	,	the	 s 	 wan 	 	.
 chin 	 a 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	great	 poet 	 s 	 	,
but	we	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	in	the	people	's	 re 	 public 	 	public	school	curriculum	,	they	have	three	 fair 	 y 	 	 tale 	 s 	 	by	an	tu	sheng	,	or	hans	christian	anderson	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	call	him	.
so	that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	all	1.3	billion	chinese	have	grown	up	with	``	the	emperor	's	new	 clothe 	 s 	 	,	``	``	the	 match 	 stick 	 	girl	``	and	``	the	little	 mer 	 maid 	 	.	``
it	's	 al 	 most 	 	like	a	fragment	of	danish	culture	 integrate 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	chinese	culture	.
the	 big 	 gest 	 	tourist	 attract 	 ion 	 	in	 chin 	 a 	 	is	the	great	wall	.
the	great	wall	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	that	can	be	 s 	 een 	 	from	the	moon	.
the	big	tourist	 attract 	 ion 	 	in	denmark	is	the	little	 mer 	 maid 	 	.
that	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	 hard 	 ly 	 	be	 s 	 een 	 	from	the	 can 	 al 	 	 tour 	 s 	 	.
and	it	sort	of	 show 	 s 	 	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	these	two	cities	.
copenhagen	,	shanghai	,	modern	,	european	.
but	then	we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 re 	 cent 	 	urban	 develop 	 ment 	 	,	and	we	 notice 	 d 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	like	a	shanghai	street	,	30	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.	all	 bike 	 s 	 	,	no	 car 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	how	it	 look 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	;	all	traffic	jam	.
 bi 	 cycle 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 come 	 	 forbid 	 den 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 place 	 s 	 	.
 mean 	 while 	 	,	in	copenhagen	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 expand 	 ing 	 	the	 bi 	 cycle 	 	 lane 	 s 	 	.
a	third	of	all	the	people	commute	by	bike	.
we	have	a	free	system	of	 bi 	 cycle 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	city	bike	that	you	can	borrow	if	you	visit	the	city	.
so	we	thought	,	why	do	n't	we	 re 	 introduc 	 e 	 	the	 bi 	 cycle 	 	in	 chin 	 a 	 	?
we	 don 	 ate 	 	1,000	 bike 	 s 	 	to	shanghai	.
so	if	you	come	to	the	expo	,	go	straight	to	the	danish	pavilion	,
get	a	danish	bike	,	and	then	 continu 	 e 	 	on	that	to	visit	the	other	 pavilion 	 s 	 	.
like	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	shanghai	and	copenhagen	are	both	port	cities	,
but	in	copenhagen	the	water	 ha 	 s 	 	gotten	so	clean	that	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	swim	in	it	.
one	of	the	first	 project 	 s 	 	we	ever	did	was	the	harbor	bath	in	copenhagen	,	sort	of	 continu 	 ing 	 	the	public	realm	 in 	 to 	 	the	water	.
so	we	thought	that	these	 expo 	 s 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	often	have	a	lot	of	state	 finance 	 d 	 	 propag 	 and 	 a 	 	,	 image 	 s 	 	,	 state 	 ments 	 	,	but	no	real	experience	.
so	just	like	with	a	bike	,	we	do	n't	talk	about	it	.
you	can	try	it	.
like	with	the	water	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	it	,	we	're	going	to	sail	a	million	 liter 	 s 	 	of	harbor	water	from	copenhagen	to	shanghai	,
so	the	chinese	who	have	the	courage	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	 d 	 ive 	 	in	and	feel	how	clean	it	is	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	where	people	 normal 	 ly 	 	object	that	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	sound	 ver 	 y 	 	 sustain 	 able 	 	to	sail	water	from	copenhagen	to	 chin 	 a 	 	.
but	in	fact	,	the	 contain 	 er 	 	 ship 	 s 	 	go	full	of	 good 	 s 	 	from	 chin 	 a 	 	to	denmark	,
and	then	they	sail	empty	back	.
so	 quit 	 e 	 	often	you	load	water	for	 ball 	 ast 	 	.
so	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	hitch	a	ride	for	free	.
and	in	the	middle	of	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	harbor	bath	,	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	to	put	the	actual	little	 mer 	 maid 	 	.
so	the	real	 mer 	 maid 	 	,	the	real	water	,	and	the	real	 bike 	 s 	 	.
and	when	she	's	gone	,	we	're	going	to	 invit 	 e 	 	a	chinese	artist	to	 re 	 interpret 	 	her	.
the	 architect 	 ure 	 	of	the	pavilion	is	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	loop	of	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	and	 bike 	 s 	 	.
when	you	go	to	the	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	,	you	'll	see	the	 mer 	 maid 	 	and	the	pool	.
you	'll	walk	around	,	start	looking	for	a	 bi 	 cycle 	 	on	the	roof	,	jump	on	your	ride	and	then	 continu 	 e 	 	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	rest	of	the	expo	.
so	when	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	won	the	 com 	 petition 	 	we	had	to	do	an	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	in	 chin 	 a 	 	 explain 	 ing 	 	the	project	.
and	to	our	surprise	we	got	one	of	our	 board 	 s 	 	back	with	 correct 	 ions 	 	from	the	chinese	state	 censor 	 ship 	 	.
the	first	thing	,	the	 chin 	 a 	 	map	 mis 	 s 	 ed 	 	taiwan	.
it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	serious	 politic 	 al 	 	issue	in	 chin 	 a 	 	.	we	will	add	on	.
the	second	thing	,	we	had	 compar 	 ed 	 	the	 s 	 wan 	 	to	the	dragon	,
and	then	the	chinese	state	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	suggest	change	to	 pan 	 da 	 	.	``
so	,	when	it	came	out	in	denmark	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	to	move	our	national	monument	,	the	national	people	's	party	sort	of	 rebel 	 led 	 	against	it	.
they	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	pass	a	law	against	moving	the	 mer 	 maid 	 	.
so	for	the	first	time	,	i	got	 invit 	 ed 	 	to	speak	at	the	national	parliament	.
it	was	kind	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	from	9	to	11	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 discuss 	 ing 	 	the	 bail 	 out 	 	package	--	how	 man 	 y 	 	 billion 	 s 	 	to	invest	in	saving	the	danish	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
and	then	at	11	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	they	 stop 	 ped 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	these	little	 issue 	 s 	 	.
and	then	from	11	to	1	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 deb 	 ating 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	to	 s 	 end 	 	the	 mer 	 maid 	 	to	 chin 	 a 	 	.
but	to	conclude	,	if	you	want	to	see	the	 mer 	 maid 	 	from	may	to	december	next	year	,	do	n't	come	to	copenhagen	,
 be 	 cause 	 	she	's	going	to	be	in	shanghai	.
if	you	do	come	to	copenhagen	,	you	will	 prob 	 ably 	 	see	an	 install 	 ation 	 	by	ai	weiwei	,	the	chinese	artist	.
but	if	the	chinese	government	 inter 	 vene 	 s 	 	,	it	might	even	be	a	 pan 	 da 	 	.
so	the	second	story	that	i	'd	like	to	tell	is	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	 start 	 s 	 	in	my	own	house	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	my	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	view	from	my	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	,
over	the	sort	of	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	of	 tri 	 angular 	 	 balc 	 onies 	 	that	our	client	 call 	 ed 	 	the	leonardo	dicaprio	 balc 	 ony 	 	.
and	they	form	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	 vert 	 ical 	 	 back 	 yard 	 	where	,	on	a	nice	summer	day	,	you	'll	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	 introduc 	 ed 	 	to	all	your	 neighbor 	 s 	 
in	a	 vert 	 ical 	 	 radi 	 us 	 	of	10	 meter 	 s 	 	.
the	house	is	sort	of	a	 distort 	 ion 	 	of	a	square	block	.	 try 	 ing 	 	to	zigzag	it	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	all	of	the	 a 	 part 	 ments 	 	look	at	the	straight	 view 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 in 	 to 	 	each	other	.
 un 	 til 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	view	from	my	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	,
onto	 th 	 is 	 	place	where	our	client	 actual 	 ly 	 	 b 	 ought 	 	the	neighbor	 s 	 ite 	 	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	that	he	was	going	to	do	an	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	block	next	to	a	 park 	 ing 	 	structure	.
and	we	thought	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 do 	 ing 	 	a	 tradition 	 al 	 	stack	of	 a 	 part 	 ments 	 	looking	straight	 in 	 to 	 	a	big	 bor 	 ing 	 	block	of	 car 	 s 	 	,	why	do	n't	we	turn	all	the	 a 	 part 	 ments 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 pent 	 house 	 s 	 	,	put	them	on	a	 pod 	 ium 	 	of	 car 	 s 	 	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	copenhagen	is	 complete 	 ly 	 	flat	,	if	you	want	to	have	a	nice	south	-	facing	 slop 	 e 	 	with	a	view	,	you	 bas 	 ically 	 	have	to	do	it	 your 	 self 	 	.
then	we	sort	of	cut	up	the	volume	,	so	we	would	n't	block	the	view	from	my	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	.
and	 essential 	 ly 	 	the	 park 	 ing 	 	is	sort	of	 occupy 	 ing 	 	the	deep	space	 under 	 neath 	 	the	 a 	 part 	 ments 	 	.	and	up	in	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	you	have	a	single	layer	of	 a 	 part 	 ments 	 	that	combine	all	the	 splendor 	 s 	 	of	a	 sub 	 urban 	 	 life 	 style 	 	,	like	a	house	with	a	garden	with	a	sort	of	 metro 	 politan 	 	view	,	and	a	sort	of	dense	urban	location	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	our	first	 architect 	 ural 	 	model	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 a 	 erial 	 	photo	taken	last	summer	.
and	 essential 	 ly 	 	,	the	 a 	 part 	 ments 	 	cover	the	 park 	 ing 	 	.
they	are	 access 	 ed 	 	through	 th 	 is 	 	diagonal	 elev 	 ator 	 	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	stand	-	up	product	from	switzerland	,
 be 	 cause 	 	in	switzerland	they	have	a	natural	need	for	diagonal	 elev 	 ators 	 	.
and	the	facade	of	the	 park 	 ing 	 	,	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	make	the	 park 	 ing 	 	 natural 	 ly 	 	 ventil 	 ated 	 	,
so	we	 need 	 ed 	 	to	 perfo 	 rate 	 	it	.
and	we	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	by	 controll 	 ing 	 	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	 hole 	 s 	 	,	we	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	turn	the	entire	facade	 in 	 to 	 	a	 gig 	 antic 	 	,	 natural 	 ly 	 	 ventil 	 ated 	 	,	rasterized	image	.
and	since	we	 al 	 ways 	 	refer	to	the	project	 a 	 s 	 	the	mountain	,	we	 commission 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	japanese	himalaya	 photograph 	 er 	 	to	give	us	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	photo	of	mount	everest	,	making	the	entire	building	a	3,000	square	meter	 art 	 work 	 	.
so	if	you	go	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	 park 	 ing 	 	,	 in 	 to 	 	the	 corridor 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 al 	 most 	 	like	 travel 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	parallel	 uni 	 verse 	 	from	 car 	 s 	 	and	 color 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	south	-	facing	urban	 oa 	 sis 	 	.
the	wood	of	your	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	 continu 	 es 	 	 out 	 side 	 	 be 	 coming 	 	the	 facade 	 s 	 	.
if	you	go	even	further	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	green	garden	.
and	all	the	 rain 	 water 	 	that	 drop 	 s 	 	on	the	mountain	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 accumul 	 ated 	 	.
and	there	is	an	 autom 	 atic 	 	 irrig 	 ation 	 	system	that	 make 	 s 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	of	 garden 	 s 	 	,	in	one	or	two	 year 	 s 	 	it	will	sort	of	transform	 in 	 to 	 	a	cambodian	temple	ruin	,	 complete 	 ly 	 	 cover 	 ed 	 	in	green	.
so	,	the	mountain	is	like	our	first	built	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	what	we	like	to	refer	to	 a 	 s 	 	 architect 	 ural 	 	alchemy	.
 th 	 is 	 	idea	that	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	create	,	if	not	gold	,	then	at	 l 	 east 	 	 add 	 ed 	 	value	by	 mix 	 ing 	 	 tradition 	 al 	 	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	,	like	normal	 a 	 part 	 ments 	 	and	normal	 park 	 ing 	 	,	and	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	 actual 	 ly 	 	 off 	 er 	 	people	the	chance	that	they	do	n't	have	to	 choos 	 e 	 	between	a	life	with	a	garden	or	a	life	in	the	city	.
they	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	both	.
 a 	 s 	 	an	architect	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	to	set	the	agenda	.
you	ca	n't	just	say	that	now	i	'd	like	to	do	a	 sustain 	 able 	 	city	in	central	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	,
 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	how	you	get	 commission 	 s 	 	.
you	 al 	 ways 	 	have	to	sort	of	adapt	and	 improv 	 ise 	 	to	the	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	and	 accident 	 s 	 	that	happen	,	and	the	sort	of	turmoil	of	the	world	.
one	last	 ex 	 ample 	 	is	that	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	we	,	like	last	summer	,	we	won	the	 com 	 petition 	 	to	design	a	nordic	national	bank	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	the	director	of	the	bank	when	he	was	still	 smil 	 ing 	 	.
it	was	in	the	middle	of	the	capital	so	we	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	it	was	the	national	bank	of	iceland	.
at	the	same	time	,	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	a	 visit 	 or 	 	--	a	 mini 	 ster 	 	from	azerbaijan	came	to	our	 off 	 ice 	 	.
we	took	him	to	see	the	mountain	.	and	he	got	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	idea	that	you	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	make	 mountain 	 s 	 	out	of	 architect 	 ure 	 	,
 be 	 cause 	 	azerbaijan	is	known	 a 	 s 	 	the	alps	of	central	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	.
so	he	 ask 	 ed 	 	us	if	we	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	imagine	an	urban	master	plan	on	an	 is 	 land 	 	 out 	 side 	 	the	capital	that	would	 re 	 create 	 	the	 s 	 il 	 houette 	 	of	the	seven	most	significant	 mountain 	 s 	 	of	azerbaijan	.
so	we	took	the	commission	.
and	we	made	 th 	 is 	 	small	movie	that	i	'd	like	to	show	.
we	 quit 	 e 	 	often	make	little	 movie 	 s 	 	.
we	 al 	 ways 	 	 argu 	 e 	 	a	lot	about	the	 sound 	 track 	 	,
but	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	easy	to	 choos 	 e 	 	the	song	.
so	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	baku	is	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	 cr 	 escent 	 	 ba 	 y 	 	 overlook 	 ing 	 	the	 is 	 land 	 	of	zira	,	the	 is 	 land 	 	that	we	are	 plan 	 ning 	 	--	 al 	 most 	 	like	the	 dia 	 gram 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	flag	.
and	our	main	idea	was	to	sort	of	 s 	 ample 	 	the	seven	most	significant	 mountain 	 s 	 	of	the	 top 	 ography 	 	of	azerbaijan	and	 re 	 interpret 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	urban	and	 architect 	 ural 	 	 structure 	 s 	 	,	 inhabit 	 able 	 	of	human	life	.
then	we	place	these	 mountain 	 s 	 	on	the	 is 	 land 	 	,	 surround 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	central	green	 val 	 ley 	 	,	 al 	 most 	 	like	a	central	park	.
and	what	 make 	 s 	 	it	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	that	the	 is 	 land 	 	right	now	is	just	a	piece	of	desert	.	it	 ha 	 s 	 	no	 veget 	 ation 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	no	water	.	it	 ha 	 s 	 	no	energy	,	no	 resource 	 s 	 	.
so	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	sort	of	designed	the	entire	 is 	 land 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	single	 eco 	 system 	 	,	 exploit 	 ing 	 	wind	energy	to	drive	the	 de 	 s 	 al 	 in 	 ation 	 	 plant 	 s 	 	,	and	to	use	the	thermal	 proper 	 ties 	 	of	water	to	heat	and	cool	the	 building 	 s 	 	.
and	all	the	sort	of	excess	 fresh 	 water 	 	 waste 	 water 	 	is	 filter 	 ed 	 	 organ 	 ically 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	,	 gradu 	 ally 	 	 transform 	 ing 	 	the	desert	 is 	 land 	 	 in 	 to 	 	sort	of	a	green	,	lush	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	.
so	,	you	can	say	where	an	urban	 develop 	 ment 	 	 normal 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	at	the	expense	of	nature	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	creating	nature	.
and	the	 building 	 s 	 	,	they	do	n't	 on 	 ly 	 	sort	of	invoke	the	 image 	 ry 	 	of	the	 mountain 	 s 	 	,
they	 al 	 so 	 	 oper 	 ate 	 	like	 mountain 	 s 	 	.
they	create	shelter	from	the	wind	.
they	 accumul 	 ate 	 	the	solar	energy	.
they	 accumul 	 ate 	 	the	water	.
so	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	transform	the	entire	 is 	 land 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	single	 eco 	 system 	 	.
so	we	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 present 	 ed 	 	the	master	plan	,
and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	gotten	approved	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	summer	we	are	 start 	 ing 	 	the	construction	 document 	 s 	 	of	the	two	first	 mountain 	 s 	 	,	in	what	's	going	to	be	the	first	carbon	-	neutral	 is 	 land 	 	in	central	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	just	to	round	off	.	so	in	a	way	you	can	see	how	the	mountain	in	copenhagen	sort	of	 evolv 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	seven	 peak 	 s 	 	of	azerbaijan	.
with	a	little	luck	and	some	more	evolution	,	 may 	 be 	 	in	10	 year 	 s 	 	it	could	be	the	five	 mountain 	 s 	 	on	mars	.
thank	you	.
