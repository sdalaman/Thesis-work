or	so	we	should	hope	.
 be 	 cause 	 	that	event	was	the	scientific	revolution	,	ever	since	which	our	knowledge	of	the	physical	world	,	and	of	how	to	adapt	it	to	our	 wish 	 es 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	growing	 relent 	 lessly 	 	.
now	,	what	had	 change 	 d 	 	?
what	 we 	 re 	 	people	now	 do 	 ing 	 	for	the	first	time	that	made	that	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	 stag 	 nation 	 	and	rapid	,	open	-	 end 	 ed 	 	 discover 	 y 	 	?
how	to	make	that	 differ 	 ence 	 	is	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	universal	truth	that	it	is	possible	to	know	.
 worry 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	there	is	no	 con 	 sens 	 us 	 	about	what	it	is	.
so	,	i	'll	tell	you	.
but	i	'll	have	to	 back 	 track 	 	a	little	first	.
before	the	scientific	revolution	,	they	 believ 	 ed 	 	that	 every 	 thing 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	 know 	 able 	 	,	was	 al 	 ready 	 	known	,	 enshrin 	 ed 	 	in	ancient	 writing 	 s 	 	,	 institution 	 s 	 	,	and	in	some	 genuine 	 ly 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	 rule 	 s 	 	of	thumb	--	which	 we 	 re 	 	,	 how 	 ever 	 	,	 en 	 trench 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 dogma 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 long 	 	with	 man 	 y 	 	 false 	 hood 	 s 	 	.
so	they	 believ 	 ed 	 	that	knowledge	came	from	 author 	 ities 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 k 	 new 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	little	.
and	 there 	 fore 	 	progress	 depend 	 ed 	 	on	 learn 	 ing 	 	how	to	reject	the	 author 	 ity 	 	of	 learn 	 ed 	 	men	,	 priest 	 s 	 	,	 tradition 	 s 	 	and	 rul 	 ers 	 	.
which	is	why	the	scientific	revolution	had	to	have	a	 wide 	 r 	 	 con 	 text 	 	.	the	 enlighten 	 ment 	 	,	a	revolution	in	how	people	 s 	 ought 	 	knowledge	,	 try 	 ing 	 	not	to	 re 	 ly 	 	on	 author 	 ity 	 	.
``	take	no	one	's	word	for	it	.	``	but	that	ca	n't	be	what	made	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
 author 	 ities 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	 reject 	 ed 	 	before	,	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	.
and	that	 rare 	 ly 	 	,	if	ever	,	 caus 	 ed 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	like	the	scientific	revolution	.
at	the	time	,	what	they	thought	 distinguish 	 ed 	 	science	was	a	radical	idea	about	 thing 	 s 	 	 un 	 s 	 een 	 	,	known	 a 	 s 	 	 empir 	 ic 	 ism 	 	.
all	knowledge	 deriv 	 es 	 	from	the	 sense 	 s 	 	.
well	,	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	that	that	ca	n't	be	true	.
it	did	help	by	promoting	 observ 	 ation 	 	and	experiment	.
but	,	from	the	 out 	 set 	 	,	it	was	obvious	that	there	was	 some 	 thing 	 	 horr 	 ibly 	 	wrong	with	it	.
knowledge	 come 	 s 	 	from	the	 sense 	 s 	 	.
in	what	language	?	 certain 	 ly 	 	not	the	language	of	 mathematic 	 s 	 	,	in	which	,	galileo	 right 	 ly 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	the	book	of	nature	is	written	.
look	at	the	world	.	you	do	n't	see	 equ 	 ations 	 	 carv 	 ed 	 	on	to	the	 mountain 	 side 	 s 	 	.
if	you	did	,	it	would	be	 be 	 cause 	 	people	had	 carv 	 ed 	 	them	.
by	the	way	,	why	do	n't	we	do	that	?
what	's	wrong	with	us	?
 empir 	 ic 	 ism 	 	is	 in 	 ad 	 equate 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	,	well	,	scientific	 the 	 ories 	 	explain	the	 s 	 een 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	 un 	 s 	 een 	 	.
and	the	 un 	 s 	 een 	 	,	you	have	to	admit	,	 do 	 es 	 	n't	come	to	us	through	the	 sense 	 s 	 	.
we	do	n't	see	 t 	 hose 	 	nuclear	 react 	 ions 	 	in	 star 	 s 	 	.
we	do	n't	see	the	origin	of	species	.
we	do	n't	see	the	 curv 	 ature 	 	of	space	-	time	,	and	other	 uni 	 verse 	 s 	 	.
but	we	know	about	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
how	?
well	,	the	classic	empiricist	answer	is	 indu 	 ction 	 	.
the	 un 	 s 	 een 	 	 resemble 	 s 	 	the	 s 	 een 	 	.	but	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	.
you	know	what	the	 cl 	 inch 	 ing 	 	evidence	was	that	space	-	time	is	 curv 	 ed 	 	?
it	was	a	photograph	,	not	of	space	-	time	,	but	of	an	eclipse	,	with	a	dot	there	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	there	.
and	the	evidence	for	evolution	?
some	 rock 	 s 	 	and	some	 fin 	 ches 	 	.
and	parallel	 uni 	 verse 	 s 	 	?	 aga 	 in 	 	:	 dot 	 s 	 	there	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	there	,	on	a	screen	.
what	we	see	,	in	all	these	 case 	 s 	 	,	 bear 	 s 	 	no	 re 	 semblance 	 	to	the	 re 	 ality 	 	that	we	conclude	is	 respons 	 ible 	 	--	 on 	 ly 	 	a	long	chain	of	 theoretic 	 al 	 	 reason 	 ing 	 	and	 interpret 	 ation 	 	 connect 	 s 	 	them	.
``	ah	!	``	say	 creation 	 ists 	 	.	``	so	you	admit	it	's	all	 interpret 	 ation 	 	.

and	they	do	n't	perceive	even	 t 	 hose 	 	 a 	 s 	 	what	they	 re 	 ally 	 	are	,	 name 	 ly 	 	 electric 	 al 	 	 crack 	 les 	 	.
so	we	perceive	 noth 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	what	it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	.
our	 connect 	 ion 	 	to	 re 	 ality 	 	is	never	just	 per 	 ception 	 	.
it	's	 al 	 ways 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	karl	popper	put	it	,	 theor 	 y 	 	-	laden	.
scientific	knowledge	is	n't	derived	from	 any 	 thing 	 	.
it	's	like	all	knowledge	.	it	's	 con 	 ject 	 ural 	 	,	 guess 	 work 	 	,	tested	by	 observ 	 ation 	 	,	not	derived	from	it	.
so	,	 we 	 re 	 	 test 	 able 	 	 conjecture 	 s 	 	the	great	 innov 	 ation 	 	that	 open 	 ed 	 	the	intellectual	 pri 	 son 	 	 gate 	 s 	 	?
no	.	 contr 	 ary 	 	to	what	's	 usual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 test 	 ability 	 	is	common	,	in	 myth 	 s 	 	and	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	other	irrational	 mode 	 s 	 	of	 think 	 ing 	 	.
any	crank	 claim 	 ing 	 	the	 s 	 un 	 	will	go	out	next	tuesday	 ha 	 s 	 	got	a	 test 	 able 	 	 predict 	 ion 	 	.
consider	the	ancient	greek	myth	 explain 	 ing 	 	 season 	 s 	 	.
hades	,	god	of	the	 under 	 world 	 	,	 kidnap 	 s 	 	persephone	,	the	goddess	of	spring	,	and	 negoti 	 ates 	 	a	 force 	 d 	 	marriage	contract	,	 requir 	 ing 	 	her	to	return	 regular 	 ly 	 	,	and	lets	her	go	.
and	each	year	,	she	is	 magic 	 ally 	 	 compel 	 led 	 	to	return	.
and	her	mother	,	demeter	,	goddess	of	the	earth	,	is	 s 	 ad 	 	,	and	 make 	 s 	 	it	cold	and	 bar 	 ren 	 	.
that	myth	is	 test 	 able 	 	.
if	winter	is	 caus 	 ed 	 	by	demeter	's	 s 	 ad 	 ness 	 	,	then	it	must	happen	 every 	 where 	 	on	earth	 simultaneous 	 ly 	 	.
so	if	the	ancient	greeks	had	 on 	 ly 	 	known	that	australia	is	at	 it 	 s 	 	 warm 	 est 	 	when	demeter	is	at	her	 s 	 add 	 est 	 	,	they	'd	have	known	that	 the 	 ir 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	is	false	.
so	what	was	wrong	with	that	myth	,	and	with	all	pre	-	scientific	 think 	 ing 	 	,	and	what	,	then	,	made	that	 moment 	 ous 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 	?
i	think	there	is	one	thing	you	have	to	care	about	.
and	that	 im 	 plies 	 	 test 	 ability 	 	,	the	scientific	method	,	the	 enlighten 	 ment 	 	,	and	 every 	 thing 	 	.
and	here	is	the	 cruci 	 al 	 	thing	.
there	is	 s 	 uch 	 	a	thing	 a 	 s 	 	a	defect	in	a	story	.
i	do	n't	just	mean	a	logical	defect	.	i	mean	a	bad	 explan 	 ation 	 	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	?	well	,	 explan 	 ation 	 	is	an	 assert 	 ion 	 	about	what	's	there	,	 un 	 s 	 een 	 	,	that	 account 	 s 	 	for	what	's	 s 	 een 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	 explan 	 atory 	 	role	of	persephone	's	marriage	contract	could	be	 play 	 ed 	 	 equal 	 ly 	 	well	by	 infinite 	 ly 	 	 man 	 y 	 	other	ad	hoc	 ent 	 ities 	 	.
why	a	marriage	contract	and	not	any	other	reason	for	regular	annual	action	?
here	is	one	.	persephone	was	n't	released	.
she	 es 	 cap 	 ed 	 	,	and	 return 	 s 	 	every	spring	to	take	 re 	 venge 	 	on	hades	,	with	her	spring	 power 	 s 	 	.
she	 cool 	 s 	 	his	domain	with	spring	air	,	 vent 	 ing 	 	heat	up	to	the	surface	,	creating	summer	.
that	 account 	 s 	 	for	the	same	 phenomen 	 a 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	original	myth	.
it	's	 equal 	 ly 	 	 test 	 able 	 	.
yet	what	it	 assert 	 s 	 	about	 re 	 ality 	 	is	,	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	,	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	.
and	that	is	possible	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 detail 	 s 	 	of	the	original	myth	are	 un 	 related 	 	to	 season 	 s 	 	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	via	the	myth	 it 	 self 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	easy	 vari 	 ability 	 	is	the	sign	of	a	bad	 explan 	 ation 	 	,
 be 	 cause 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	a	functional	reason	to	prefer	one	of	 count 	 less 	 	 vari 	 ants 	 	,	 advoc 	 ating 	 	one	of	them	,	in	 pre 	 ference 	 	to	the	 other 	 s 	 	,	is	irrational	.
so	,	for	the	 es 	 s 	 ence 	 	of	what	 make 	 s 	 	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	to	 en 	 able 	 	progress	,	seek	good	 explan 	 ations 	 	,	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	ca	n't	be	 eas 	 ily 	 	 vari 	 ed 	 	,	while	still	 explain 	 ing 	 	the	 phenomen 	 a 	 	.
now	,	our	current	 explan 	 ation 	 	of	 season 	 s 	 	is	that	the	earth	's	axis	is	 tilt 	 ed 	 	like	that	,	so	each	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	 tilt 	 s 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	the	 s 	 un 	 	for	half	the	year	,	and	away	for	the	other	half	.
better	put	that	up	.
that	's	a	good	 explan 	 ation 	 	:	hard	to	vary	,	 be 	 cause 	 	every	detail	 play 	 s 	 	a	functional	role	.
for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	we	know	,	 in 	 dependent 	 ly 	 	of	 season 	 s 	 	,	that	 surface 	 s 	 	 tilt 	 ed 	 	away	from	 radi 	 ant 	 	heat	are	heated	less	,
and	that	a	 s 	 pinning 	 	sphere	,	in	space	,	 point 	 s 	 	in	a	constant	direction	.
and	the	tilt	 al 	 so 	 	 explain 	 s 	 	the	 s 	 un 	 	's	angle	of	 elev 	 ation 	 	at	different	 time 	 s 	 	of	year	,	and	 predict 	 s 	 	that	the	 season 	 s 	 	will	be	out	of	phase	in	the	two	 hemi 	 sphere 	 s 	 	.
if	they	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 observ 	 ed 	 	in	phase	,	the	 theor 	 y 	 	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	 re 	 fu 	 ted 	 	.
but	now	,	the	fact	that	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	good	 explan 	 ation 	 	,	hard	to	vary	,	 make 	 s 	 	the	 cruci 	 al 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
if	the	ancient	greeks	had	found	out	about	 season 	 s 	 	in	australia	,	they	could	have	 eas 	 ily 	 	 vari 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	myth	to	predict	that	.
for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	when	demeter	is	 up 	 set 	 	,	she	 banish 	 es 	 	heat	from	her	 vic 	 in 	 ity 	 	,	 in 	 to 	 	the	other	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	,	where	it	 make 	 s 	 	summer	.
so	,	 be 	 ing 	 	 prov 	 ed 	 	wrong	by	 observ 	 ation 	 	,	and	changing	 the 	 ir 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	 accord 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	still	would	n't	have	got	the	ancient	greeks	one	 jo 	 t 	 	 close 	 r 	 	to	 understand 	 ing 	 	 season 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 explan 	 ation 	 	was	bad	:	easy	to	vary	.
and	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	when	an	 explan 	 ation 	 	is	good	that	it	even	 matter 	 s 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	 test 	 able 	 	.
if	the	axis	-	tilt	 theor 	 y 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	 re 	 fu 	 ted 	 	,	 it 	 s 	 	 defend 	 ers 	 	would	have	had	 no 	 where 	 	to	go	.
no	 eas 	 ily 	 	 implement 	 ed 	 	change	could	make	that	tilt	cause	the	same	 season 	 s 	 	in	both	 hemi 	 sphere 	 s 	 	.
the	search	for	hard	-	to	-	vary	 explan 	 ations 	 	is	the	origin	of	all	progress	.
it	's	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	 regulat 	 ing 	 	principle	of	the	 enlighten 	 ment 	 	.
so	,	in	science	,	two	false	 approach 	 es 	 	 b 	 light 	 	progress	.
one	is	well	known	:	 un 	 test 	 able 	 	 the 	 ories 	 	.
but	the	more	 import 	 ant 	 	one	is	 explan 	 ation 	 less 	 	 the 	 ories 	 	.
 when 	 ever 	 	you	're	told	that	some	 exist 	 ing 	 	 statistic 	 al 	 	trend	will	 continu 	 e 	 	,	but	you	are	n't	 give 	 n 	 	a	hard	-	to	-	vary	account	of	what	 cause 	 s 	 	that	trend	,	you	're	 be 	 ing 	 	told	a	wizard	did	it	.
