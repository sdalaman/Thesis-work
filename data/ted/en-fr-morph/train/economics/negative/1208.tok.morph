for	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	i	can	remember	,	i	have	felt	a	 ver 	 y 	 	deep	 connect 	 ion 	 	to	 animal 	 s 	 	and	to	the	ocean	.
and	at	 th 	 is 	 	age	,	my	personal	idol	was	 flip 	 per 	 	the	dolphin	.
and	when	i	first	 learn 	 ed 	 	about	 en 	 danger 	 ed 	 	species	,	i	was	 tru 	 ly 	 	 di 	 stress 	 ed 	 	to	know	that	every	day	 animal 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 wipe 	 d 	 	off	the	face	of	 th 	 is 	 	earth	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	to	help	,	but	i	 al 	 ways 	 	 wonder 	 ed 	 	,	what	could	one	person	possibly	do	to	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	?
and	it	would	be	30	 year 	 s 	 	,	but	i	would	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	get	the	answer	to	that	question	.
when	these	 heart 	 break 	 ing 	 	 image 	 s 	 	of	 oil 	 ed 	 	 bird 	 s 	 	 final 	 ly 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	to	emerge	from	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	of	mexico	last	year	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	 horr 	 ific 	 	bp	oil	 s 	 pill 	 	,	a	german	biologist	by	the	name	of	silvia	gaus	was	 quote 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	we	should	just	euthanize	all	 oil 	 ed 	 	 bird 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	have	 show 	 n 	 	that	 few 	 er 	 	than	one	percent	of	them	 surviv 	 e 	 	after	 be 	 ing 	 	released	.	``
and	i	could	not	disagree	more	.
and	in	 add 	 ition 	 	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	every	 oil 	 ed 	 	animal	 deserve 	 s 	 	a	second	chance	at	life	.
and	i	want	to	tell	you	why	i	feel	so	 strong 	 ly 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
on	june	23rd	,	2000	,	a	ship	named	the	 treasu 	 re 	 	 s 	 an 	 k 	 	off	the	coast	of	cape	town	,	south	africa	,	 s 	 pill 	 ing 	 	1,300	 ton 	 s 	 	of	fuel	,	which	 pollute 	 d 	 	the	 habit 	 at 	 s 	 	of	 near 	 ly 	 	half	the	entire	world	population	of	african	 penguin 	 s 	 	.
now	the	ship	 s 	 an 	 k 	 	between	robben	 is 	 land 	 	to	the	south	and	dassen	 is 	 land 	 	to	the	north	.
and	these	are	two	of	the	 penguin 	 s 	 	'	main	 breed 	 ing 	 	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	.
and	 exact 	 ly 	 	six	 year 	 s 	 	and	three	 day 	 s 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	,	on	june	20th	,	1994	,	a	ship	named	the	apollo	sea	 s 	 an 	 k 	 	near	dassen	 is 	 land 	 	,	 oil 	 ing 	 	10,000	 penguin 	 s 	 	--	half	of	which	 di 	 ed 	 	.
now	when	the	 treasu 	 re 	 	 s 	 an 	 k 	 	in	2000	,	it	was	the	height	of	the	best	 breed 	 ing 	 	season	 scientist 	 s 	 	had	ever	 record 	 ed 	 	for	the	african	penguin	--	which	at	the	time	,	was	 list 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 threaten 	 ed 	 	species	.
and	soon	,	 near 	 ly 	 	20,000	 penguin 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 cover 	 ed 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	toxic	oil	.
and	the	local	 sea 	 bird 	 	 rescu 	 e 	 	center	,	named	sanccob	,	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	 launch 	 ed 	 	a	massive	 rescu 	 e 	 	operation	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	soon	would	 be 	 come 	 	the	largest	animal	 rescu 	 e 	 	ever	 under 	 taken 	 	.
now	at	the	time	,	i	was	 work 	 ing 	 	down	the	street	.
i	was	a	penguin	 a 	 quar 	 ist 	 	at	the	new	england	 aqua 	 rium 	 	.
and	 exact 	 ly 	 	11	 year 	 s 	 	ago	 yester 	 day 	 	,	the	phone	rang	in	the	penguin	 off 	 ice 	 	.
and	with	that	call	,	my	life	would	change	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
it	was	estelle	van	der	meer	 call 	 ing 	 	from	sanccob	,	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	 pleas 	 e 	 	come	help	.
we	have	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 oil 	 ed 	 	 penguin 	 s 	 	and	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 will 	 ing 	 	,	but	 complete 	 ly 	 	 in 	 experience 	 d 	 	,	 volunteer 	 s 	 	.
and	we	need	penguin	 expert 	 s 	 	to	come	train	and	supervise	them	.	``
so	two	 day 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	i	was	on	a	plane	headed	for	cape	town	with	a	team	of	penguin	 special 	 ists 	 	.
and	the	scene	 in 	 side 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	building	was	 deva 	 stat 	 ing 	 	and	surreal	.
in	fact	,	 man 	 y 	 	people	 compar 	 ed 	 	it	to	a	war	zone	.
and	last	week	,	a	10	year	-	old	girl	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	,	``	what	did	it	feel	like	when	you	first	 walk 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	that	building	and	saw	so	 man 	 y 	 	 oil 	 ed 	 	 penguin 	 s 	 	?	``
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
i	was	 instant 	 ly 	 	 transport 	 ed 	 	back	to	that	moment	in	time	.
 penguin 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	vocal	 bird 	 s 	 	and	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	noisy	.
and	so	i	 expect 	 ed 	 	to	walk	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	building	and	be	met	with	 th 	 is 	 	 caco 	 phony 	 	of	 hon 	 king 	 	and	 bra 	 y 	 ing 	 	and	 squawk 	 ing 	 	,	but	 in 	 stead 	 	,	when	we	 steppe 	 d 	 	through	 t 	 hose 	 	 door 	 s 	 	and	 in 	 to 	 	the	building	,	it	was	 eer 	 ily 	 	silent	.
so	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	these	 we 	 re 	 	 stress 	 ed 	 	,	sick	,	 trauma 	 t 	 ized 	 	 bird 	 s 	 	.
the	other	thing	that	was	so	 s 	 tri 	 king 	 	was	the	 she 	 er 	 	number	of	 volunteer 	 s 	 	.
up	to	1,000	people	a	day	came	to	the	 rescu 	 e 	 	center	,
and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	over	the	course	of	 th 	 is 	 	 rescu 	 e 	 	,	more	than	12	and	a	half	thousand	 volunteer 	 s 	 	came	from	all	over	the	world	to	cape	town	to	help	 s 	 ave 	 	these	 bird 	 s 	 	.
and	the	 amaz 	 ing 	 	thing	was	that	not	one	of	them	had	to	be	there	--	yet	they	 we 	 re 	 	.
so	for	the	few	of	us	that	 we 	 re 	 	there	in	a	professional	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	volunteer	 respons 	 e 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	animal	crisis	was	 pro 	 found 	 ly 	 	moving	and	awe	-	inspiring	.
so	the	day	after	we	 arriv 	 ed 	 	,	two	of	us	from	the	 aqua 	 rium 	 	 we 	 re 	 	put	in	charge	of	room	two	,
and	room	two	had	more	than	4,000	 oil 	 ed 	 	 penguin 	 s 	 	in	it	.
now	mind	you	,	three	 day 	 s 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	,	we	had	60	 penguin 	 s 	 	under	our	care	,
so	we	 we 	 re 	 	 definite 	 ly 	 	 overwhelm 	 ed 	 	and	just	a	bit	 terr 	 ified 	 	--	at	 l 	 east 	 	i	was	.
 personal 	 ly 	 	,	i	 re 	 ally 	 	did	n't	know	if	i	was	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 hand 	 ling 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 monstr 	 ous 	 	task	.
and	 collect 	 ively 	 	,	we	 re 	 ally 	 	did	n't	know	if	we	could	pull	 th 	 is 	 	off	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	all	 k 	 new 	 	that	just	six	 year 	 s 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	,	half	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 penguin 	 s 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	 oil 	 ed 	 	and	 rescu 	 ed 	 	and	 on 	 ly 	 	half	of	them	had	 surviv 	 ed 	 	.
so	would	it	be	 human 	 ly 	 	possible	to	 s 	 ave 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 oil 	 ed 	 	 penguin 	 s 	 	?
we	just	did	not	know	.
but	what	 g 	 ave 	 	us	hope	 we 	 re 	 	these	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 dedicate 	 d 	 	and	brave	 volunteer 	 s 	 	--	three	of	whom	here	are	force	-	 feed 	 ing 	 	 penguin 	 s 	 	.
and	you	may	notice	they	're	 wear 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	thick	 glove 	 s 	 	.
and	what	you	should	know	about	african	 penguin 	 s 	 	is	that	they	have	razor	-	sharp	 beak 	 s 	 	.	and	before	long	,	our	bodies	 we 	 re 	 	 cover 	 ed 	 	head	to	 to 	 e 	 	with	these	nasty	 wound 	 s 	 	 inflict 	 ed 	 	by	the	 terr 	 ified 	 	 penguin 	 s 	 	.
now	the	day	after	we	 arriv 	 ed 	 	,	a	new	crisis	 beg 	 an 	 	to	 un 	 fold 	 	.
the	oil	 s 	 lick 	 	was	now	moving	north	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	dassen	 is 	 land 	 	,	and	the	 rescu 	 ers 	 	 despair 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 k 	 new 	 	if	the	oil	hit	,	it	would	not	be	possible	to	 rescu 	 e 	 	any	more	 oil 	 ed 	 	 bird 	 s 	 	.
and	there	 re 	 ally 	 	 we 	 re 	 	no	good	 solution 	 s 	 	.
but	then	 final 	 ly 	 	,	one	of	the	 research 	 ers 	 	threw	out	 th 	 is 	 	crazy	idea	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	why	do	n't	we	try	and	collect	the	 bird 	 s 	 	at	the	 great 	 est 	 	risk	of	 get 	 ting 	 	 oil 	 ed 	 	``	--	they	 collect 	 ed 	 	20,000	--	``	and	we	'll	ship	them	500	 mile 	 s 	 	up	the	coast	to	port	elizabeth	in	these	open	air	 truck 	 s 	 	and	 re 	 lease 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	the	clean	 water 	 s 	 	there	and	let	them	swim	back	home	.	``
so	three	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 penguin 	 s 	 	--	peter	,	pamela	and	percy	--	 wo 	 re 	 	satellite	 tag 	 s 	 	,
and	the	 research 	 ers 	 	 cross 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 finger 	 s 	 	and	 hop 	 ed 	 	that	by	the	time	they	got	back	home	,	the	oil	would	be	 clean 	 ed 	 	up	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	.
and	 luck 	 ily 	 	,	the	day	they	 arriv 	 ed 	 	,	it	was	.
so	it	had	 be 	 en 	 	a	huge	gamble	,	but	it	had	paid	off	.
and	so	they	know	now	that	they	can	use	 th 	 is 	 	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	in	future	oil	 s 	 pill 	 s 	 	.
so	in	 wild 	 life 	 	 rescu 	 e 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	in	life	,	we	learn	from	each	previous	experience	,	and	we	learn	from	both	our	 success 	 es 	 	and	our	 failure 	 s 	 	.
and	the	main	thing	 learn 	 ed 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	apollo	sea	 rescu 	 e 	 	in	'94	was	that	most	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 penguin 	 s 	 	had	 di 	 ed 	 	due	to	the	 unwitt 	 ing 	 	use	of	 poor 	 ly 	 	 ventil 	 ated 	 	transport	boxes	and	 truck 	 s 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	they	just	had	not	 be 	 en 	 	prepared	to	deal	with	so	 man 	 y 	 	 oil 	 ed 	 	 penguin 	 s 	 	at	once	.
so	in	these	six	 year 	 s 	 	between	these	two	oil	 s 	 pill 	 s 	 	,	they	built	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	these	well	-	 ventil 	 ated 	 	boxes	,
and	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	,	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	 treasu 	 re 	 	 rescu 	 e 	 	,	just	160	 penguin 	 s 	 	 di 	 ed 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	transport	process	,	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	5,000	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 al 	 one 	 	was	a	huge	 vict 	 ory 	 	.
 some 	 thing 	 	else	 learn 	 ed 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	apollo	 rescu 	 e 	 	was	how	to	train	the	 penguin 	 s 	 	to	take	fish	 free 	 ly 	 	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	,	using	these	training	boxes	.
and	we	used	 th 	 is 	 	 techni 	 que 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	 treasu 	 re 	 	 rescu 	 e 	 	.
but	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	was	 not 	 ed 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	training	process	.
the	first	 penguin 	 s 	 	to	make	that	 transit 	 ion 	 	to	free	 feed 	 ing 	 	 we 	 re 	 	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	had	a	metal	band	on	 the 	 ir 	 	wing	from	the	apollo	sea	 s 	 pill 	 	six	 year 	 s 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	.
so	 penguin 	 s 	 	learn	from	previous	experience	,	too	.
so	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 penguin 	 s 	 	had	to	have	the	oil	 meticulous 	 ly 	 	 clean 	 ed 	 	from	 the 	 ir 	 	bodies	.
and	it	would	take	two	people	at	 l 	 east 	 	an	hour	just	to	clean	one	penguin	.
and	when	you	clean	a	penguin	,	you	first	have	to	spray	it	with	a	degreaser	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	me	to	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	story	from	the	 treasu 	 re 	 	 rescu 	 e 	 	.
about	a	year	prior	to	 th 	 is 	 	oil	 s 	 pill 	 	,	a	17	year	-	old	student	had	 invent 	 ed 	 	a	degreaser	.
and	they	'd	 be 	 en 	 	using	it	at	sanccob	with	great	success	,	so	they	 beg 	 an 	 	using	it	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	 treasu 	 re 	 	 rescu 	 e 	 	.
but	part	way	through	,	they	ran	out	.
so	in	a	panic	,	estelle	from	sanccob	 call 	 ed 	 	the	student	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 pleas 	 e 	 	,	you	have	to	make	more	.	``
so	he	 rac 	 ed 	 	to	the	lab	and	made	 en 	 ough 	 	to	clean	the	rest	of	the	 bird 	 s 	 	.
so	i	just	think	it	is	the	 cool 	 est 	 	thing	that	a	teenager	 invent 	 ed 	 	a	product	that	 help 	 ed 	 	 s 	 ave 	 	the	 live 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 animal 	 s 	 	.
so	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	 t 	 hose 	 	20,000	 oil 	 ed 	 	 penguin 	 s 	 	?
and	was	silvia	gaus	right	?
should	we	 routine 	 ly 	 	euthanize	all	 oil 	 ed 	 	 bird 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	most	of	them	are	going	to	die	 any 	 way 	 	?
well	she	could	not	be	more	wrong	.
after	half	a	million	 hour 	 s 	 	of	 gr 	 uel 	 ing 	 	volunteer	labor	,	more	than	90	percent	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 oil 	 ed 	 	 penguin 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 success 	 fully 	 	 return 	 ed 	 	to	the	wild	.
and	we	know	from	follow	-	up	 stud 	 ies 	 	that	they	have	lived	just	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	never	-	 oil 	 ed 	 	 penguin 	 s 	 	,	and	 br 	 ed 	 	 near 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 success 	 fully 	 	.
and	in	 add 	 ition 	 	,	about	3,000	penguin	 chick 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 rescu 	 ed 	 	and	hand	-	raised	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	we	know	from	long	-	term	 monitor 	 ing 	 	that	more	of	these	hand	-	raised	 chick 	 s 	 	 surviv 	 e 	 	to	 adult 	 hood 	 	and	 breed 	 ing 	 	age	than	do	parent	-	raised	 chick 	 s 	 	.
so	,	 arm 	 ed 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	knowledge	,	sanccob	 ha 	 s 	 	a	chick	-	bolstering	project	.
and	every	year	they	 rescu 	 e 	 	and	raise	 abandon 	 ed 	 	 chick 	 s 	 	,
and	they	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 impress 	 ive 	 	80	percent	success	rate	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 critical 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	,	one	year	ago	,	the	african	penguin	was	 declare 	 d 	 	 en 	 danger 	 ed 	 	.
and	they	could	be	extinct	in	less	than	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	if	we	do	n't	do	 some 	 thing 	 	now	to	protect	them	.
so	what	did	i	learn	from	 th 	 is 	 	 intens 	 e 	 	and	 un 	 forget 	 table 	 	experience	?
 personal 	 ly 	 	,	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	i	am	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 hand 	 ling 	 	so	much	more	than	i	ever	 dream 	 ed 	 	possible	.
and	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	one	person	can	make	a	huge	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
just	look	at	that	17	year	-	old	.
and	when	we	come	together	and	work	 a 	 s 	 	one	,	we	can	 achiev 	 e 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.	and	 tru 	 ly 	 	,	to	be	a	part	of	 some 	 thing 	 	so	much	 large 	 r 	 	than	 your 	 self 	 	is	the	most	 reward 	 ing 	 	experience	you	can	possibly	have	.
so	i	'd	like	to	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	one	final	thought	and	a	 challeng 	 e 	 	,	if	you	will	.
my	mission	 a 	 s 	 	the	penguin	 lad 	 y 	 	is	to	raise	 aware 	 ness 	 	and	 fund 	 ing 	 	to	protect	 penguin 	 s 	 	,	but	why	should	any	of	you	care	about	 penguin 	 s 	 	?
well	,	you	should	care	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	an	 indic 	 ator 	 	species	.
and	 simpl 	 y 	 	put	,	if	 penguin 	 s 	 	are	 dy 	 ing 	 	,	it	 mean 	 s 	 	our	 ocean 	 s 	 	are	 dy 	 ing 	 	,	and	we	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	will	be	 affect 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	sylvia	earle	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	are	our	life	-	support	system	.	``	and	the	two	main	 threat 	 s 	 	to	 penguin 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	are	 over 	 fish 	 ing 	 	and	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	.
and	these	are	two	 thing 	 s 	 	that	each	one	of	us	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	the	power	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	.
so	if	we	each	do	our	part	,	together	,	we	can	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	,	and	we	can	help	keep	 penguin 	 s 	 	from	going	extinct	.
 human 	 s 	 	have	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	the	 great 	 est 	 	threat	to	 penguin 	 s 	 	,	but	we	are	now	 the 	 ir 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	hope	.
thank	you	.
