 tree 	 s 	 	are	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 arena 	 s 	 	for	 discover 	 y 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	tall	 st 	 ature 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	complex	structure	,	the	 bio 	 divers 	 ity 	 	they	foster	and	 the 	 ir 	 	quiet	 beaut 	 y 	 	.
i	used	to	climb	 tree 	 s 	 	for	 f 	 un 	 	all	the	time	and	now	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	grown	-	up	,	i	have	made	my	profession	 understand 	 ing 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	and	 forest 	 s 	 	,	through	the	medium	of	science	.
the	most	 myster 	 ious 	 	part	of	 forest 	 s 	 	is	the	upper	tree	 can 	 opy 	 	.
and	dr.	terry	erwin	,	in	1983	,	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 can 	 opy 	 	,	``	the	last	biotic	 front 	 ier 	 	.	``
i	'd	like	to	take	you	all	on	a	journey	up	to	the	forest	 can 	 opy 	 	,	and	share	with	you	what	 can 	 opy 	 	 research 	 ers 	 	are	 ask 	 ing 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	how	they	're	 commun 	 ic 	 ating 	 	with	other	people	 out 	 side 	 	of	science	.
let	's	start	our	journey	on	the	forest	floor	of	one	of	my	 stud 	 y 	 	 s 	 ites 	 	in	costa	rica	.
 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 over 	 hang 	 ing 	 	 leav 	 es 	 	and	 branch 	 es 	 	,	you	'll	notice	that	the	 under 	 story 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	dark	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	still	.
and	what	i	'd	like	to	do	is	take	you	up	to	the	 can 	 opy 	 	,	not	by	 put 	 ting 	 	all	of	you	 in 	 to 	 	 rope 	 s 	 	and	 harness 	 es 	 	,	but	 ra 	 ther 	 	 show 	 ing 	 	you	a	 ver 	 y 	 	short	clip	from	a	national	 geo 	 graphic 	 	film	 call 	 ed 	 	``	heroes	of	the	high	 front 	 ier 	 	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	was	 film 	 ed 	 	in	monteverde	,	costa	rica	and	i	think	it	 give 	 s 	 	us	the	best	impression	of	what	it	's	like	to	climb	a	giant	 strangle 	 r 	 	fig	.
so	what	you	'll	see	up	there	is	that	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	like	the	atmosphere	of	an	open	field	,	and	there	are	tremendous	 number 	 s 	 	of	 plant 	 s 	 	and	 animal 	 s 	 	that	have	 adapt 	 ed 	 	to	make	 the 	 ir 	 	way	and	 the 	 ir 	 	life	in	the	 can 	 opy 	 	.
common	 group 	 s 	 	,	like	the	 s 	 lo 	 th 	 	here	,	have	clear	 adapt 	 ations 	 	for	forest	 can 	 o 	 pies 	 	,	 hang 	 ing 	 	on	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	 claw 	 s 	 	.
but	i	'd	like	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	to	you	a	more	subtle	kind	of	 divers 	 ity 	 	and	tell	you	about	the	ants	.
there	are	10,000	species	of	ants	that	 tax 	 onomist 	 s 	 	--	people	who	 de 	 scribe 	 	and	name	 animal 	 s 	 	--	have	named	.
4,000	of	 t 	 hose 	 	ants	live	 exclusive 	 ly 	 	in	the	forest	 can 	 opy 	 	.
one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	i	tell	you	about	ants	is	 be 	 cause 	 	of	my	husband	,	who	is	in	fact	an	ant	 tax 	 onomist 	 	and	when	we	got	married	,	he	 promise 	 d 	 	to	name	an	ant	after	me	,	which	he	did	--	procryptocerus	 nal 	 ini 	 	,	a	 can 	 opy 	 	ant	.
we	've	had	two	children	,	august	andrew	and	erika	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	he	named	ants	after	them	.
so	we	may	be	the	 on 	 ly 	 	family	that	 ha 	 s 	 	an	ant	named	after	each	one	of	us	.
but	my	 pass 	 ion 	 	--	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	jack	and	my	children	--	are	the	 plant 	 s 	 	,	the	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	 epiphyte 	 s 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 plant 	 s 	 	that	grow	up	on	 tree 	 s 	 	.	they	do	n't	have	 root 	 s 	 	that	go	 in 	 to 	 	 trunk 	 s 	 	nor	to	the	forest	floor	.
but	 ra 	 ther 	 	,	it	is	 the 	 ir 	 	 leav 	 es 	 	that	are	 adapt 	 ed 	 	to	 inter 	 cept 	 	the	 dis 	 solve 	 d 	 	 nutrient 	 s 	 	that	come	to	them	in	the	form	of	 mis 	 t 	 	and	fog	.
these	 plant 	 s 	 	occur	in	great	 divers 	 ity 	 	,	over	28,000	species	around	the	world	.
they	grow	in	 tropic 	 al 	 	 forest 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	one	and	they	 al 	 so 	 	grow	in	 temper 	 ate 	 	 rain 	 forest 	 s 	 	,	that	we	find	in	washington	state	.
these	 epiphyte 	 s 	 	are	 main 	 ly 	 	 dominate 	 d 	 	by	the	 moss 	 es 	 	.
one	thing	i	want	to	point	out	is	that	 under 	 neath 	 	these	live	 epiphyte 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	they	die	and	 de 	 compose 	 	,	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	construct	an	 ar 	 bore 	 al 	 	 s 	 oil 	 	,	both	in	the	 temper 	 ate 	 	zone	and	in	the	 tropic 	 s 	 	.
and	these	 moss 	 es 	 	,	generated	by	 de 	 com 	 posing 	 	,	are	like	 pe 	 at 	 	moss	in	your	garden	.	they	have	a	tremendous	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	for	 hold 	 ing 	 	on	to	 nutrient 	 s 	 	and	water	.
one	of	the	surprising	 thing 	 s 	 	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	is	that	,	if	you	pull	back	with	me	on	 t 	 hose 	 	 mat 	 s 	 	of	 epiphyte 	 s 	 	,	what	you	'll	find	 under 	 neath 	 	them	are	 connect 	 ions 	 	,	 network 	 s 	 	of	what	we	call	 can 	 opy 	 	 root 	 s 	 	.
these	are	not	epiphyte	 root 	 s 	 	:	these	are	 root 	 s 	 	that	emerge	from	the	trunk	and	branch	of	the	host	 tree 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
and	so	 t 	 hose 	 	 epiphyte 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 pay 	 ing 	 	the	 land 	 lord 	 	a	bit	of	rent	in	 ex 	 change 	 	for	 be 	 ing 	 	 support 	 ed 	 	high	above	the	forest	floor	.
i	was	 interest 	 ed 	 	,	and	my	 can 	 opy 	 	 research 	 er 	 	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	 dynamic 	 s 	 	of	the	 can 	 opy 	 	 plant 	 s 	 	that	live	in	the	forest	.
we	've	 d 	 one 	 	 strip 	 ping 	 	 experiment 	 s 	 	where	we	've	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	 mat 	 s 	 	of	 epiphyte 	 s 	 	and	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	rates	of	 re 	 colon 	 ization 	 	.
we	had	 predict 	 ed 	 	that	they	would	grow	back	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	and	that	they	would	come	in	 encroach 	 ing 	 	from	the	side	.
what	we	found	,	 how 	 ever 	 	,	was	that	they	took	an	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	long	time	--	over	20	 year 	 s 	 	--	to	 re 	 generate 	 	,	 start 	 ing 	 	from	the	bottom	and	growing	up	.
and	even	now	,	after	25	 year 	 s 	 	,	they	're	not	up	there	,	they	have	not	 re 	 colon 	 ized 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	.
and	i	use	 th 	 is 	 	little	image	to	say	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	 moss 	 es 	 	.
if	it	's	gone	,	it	's	gone	,	and	if	you	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	you	might	get	 some 	 thing 	 	growing	back	from	the	bottom	.
so	,	 re 	 colon 	 ization 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 low 	 	.
these	 can 	 opy 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	are	fragile	.
well	,	when	we	look	out	,	you	and	i	,	over	that	 can 	 opy 	 	of	the	 in 	 tact 	 	 prim 	 ary 	 	forest	,	what	we	see	is	 th 	 is 	 	enormous	carpet	of	carbon	.
one	of	the	 challeng 	 es 	 	that	 can 	 opy 	 	 research 	 ers 	 	are	 attack 	 ing 	 	 to 	 day 	 	is	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	the	amount	of	carbon	that	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 sequest 	 er 	 ed 	 	.
we	know	it	's	a	lot	,	but	we	do	not	yet	know	the	 answer 	 s 	 	to	how	much	,	and	by	what	 process 	 es 	 	,	carbon	is	 be 	 ing 	 	taken	out	of	the	atmosphere	,	held	in	 it 	 s 	 	 bio 	 mass 	 	,	and	moving	on	through	the	 eco 	 system 	 	.
so	i	hope	i	've	 show 	 ed 	 	you	that	 can 	 opy 	 	-	dwellers	are	not	just	 in 	 significant 	 	bits	of	green	up	high	in	the	 can 	 opy 	 	that	tarzan	and	jane	 we 	 re 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	,	but	 ra 	 ther 	 	that	they	foster	 bio 	 divers 	 ity 	 	 con 	 tribute 	 	to	 eco 	 system 	 	nutrient	 cycle 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 al 	 so 	 	help	to	keep	our	global	climate	 s 	 table 	 	.
up	in	the	 can 	 opy 	 	,	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	next	to	me	and	you	 turn 	 ed 	 	around	from	 t 	 hose 	 	 prim 	 ary 	 	forest	 eco 	 system 	 s 	 	,	you	would	 al 	 so 	 	see	 scene 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 scene 	 s 	 	of	forest	 destruct 	 ion 	 	,	forest	 harvest 	 ing 	 	and	forest	 fragment 	 ation 	 	,	 there 	 by 	 	making	that	 in 	 tact 	 	 tape 	 stry 	 	of	the	 can 	 opy 	 	 un 	 able 	 	to	function	in	the	 marvel 	 ous 	 	ways	that	it	 ha 	 s 	 	when	it	is	not	 disturb 	 ed 	 	by	 human 	 s 	 	.
i	've	 al 	 so 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	out	on	urban	 place 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	and	thought	about	people	who	are	 dis 	 associate 	 d 	 	from	 tree 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
people	who	grew	up	in	a	place	like	 th 	 is 	 	did	not	have	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	climb	 tree 	 s 	 	and	form	a	relationship	with	 tree 	 s 	 	and	 forest 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	did	when	i	was	a	young	girl	.
 th 	 is 	 	 trouble 	 s 	 	me	.
here	in	2009	,	you	know	,	it	's	not	an	easy	thing	to	be	a	forest	ecologist	,	 grip 	 ping 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	with	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 question 	 s 	 	and	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	how	we	can	answer	them	.
and	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	,	you	know	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	small	 brow 	 n 	 	woman	in	a	little	college	,	in	the	upper	 north 	 west 	 	part	of	our	country	,	far	away	from	the	 area 	 s 	 	of	power	and	money	,	i	 re 	 ally 	 	have	to	ask	 my 	 self 	 	,	``	what	can	i	do	about	 th 	 is 	 	?
how	can	i	 re 	 connect 	 	people	with	 tree 	 s 	 	?	``
well	,	i	think	that	i	can	do	 some 	 thing 	 	.
i	know	that	 a 	 s 	 	a	scientist	,	i	have	information	and	 a 	 s 	 	a	human	 be 	 ing 	 	,	i	can	communicate	with	 any 	 body 	 	,	 in 	 side 	 	or	 out 	 side 	 	of	academia	.
and	so	,	that	's	what	i	've	begin	 do 	 ing 	 	,	and	so	i	'd	like	to	unveil	the	 inter 	 national 	 	 can 	 opy 	 	network	here	.
we	consult	to	the	media	about	 can 	 opy 	 	 question 	 s 	 	;	we	have	a	 can 	 opy 	 	 news 	 letter 	 	;	we	have	an	email	listserv	.	and	so	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	disseminate	information	about	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	the	 can 	 opy 	 	,	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	of	the	 can 	 opy 	 	,	the	 necess 	 ity 	 	of	 in 	 tact 	 	 can 	 o 	 pies 	 	,	to	people	 out 	 side 	 	of	academia	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	 recogn 	 ize 	 	that	a	lot	of	the	 product 	 s 	 	that	we	make	--	 t 	 hose 	 	 video 	 s 	 	and	so	forth	--	you	know	,	they	do	n't	reach	 every 	 body 	 	,	and	so	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 foster 	 ing 	 	 project 	 s 	 	that	reach	people	 out 	 side 	 	of	academia	,	and	 out 	 side 	 	of	the	choir	that	most	 ecologist 	 s 	 	preach	to	.
treetop	barbie	is	a	great	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	that	.
what	we	do	,	my	 student 	 s 	 	in	my	lab	and	i	,	is	we	buy	barbies	from	 good 	 will 	 	and	value	village	,	we	dress	her	in	 clothe 	 s 	 	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	made	by	 seam 	 stress 	 es 	 	and	we	 s 	 end 	 	her	out	with	a	 can 	 opy 	 	 hand 	 book 	 	.
and	my	 feel 	 ing 	 	is	--	thank	you	.

we	've	 al 	 so 	 	made	 partner 	 ship 	 s 	 	with	 artist 	 s 	 	,	with	people	who	understand	and	can	communicate	the	aesthetic	 beaut 	 y 	 	of	 tree 	 s 	 	and	forest	 can 	 o 	 pies 	 	.
and	i	'd	like	to	just	tell	you	one	of	our	 project 	 s 	 	,	which	is	the	generation	of	 can 	 opy 	 	confluences	.
what	i	do	is	i	 br 	 ing 	 	together	 scientist 	 s 	 	and	 artist 	 s 	 	of	all	 kind 	 s 	 	,	and	we	 s 	 pend 	 	a	week	in	the	forest	on	these	little	 platform 	 s 	 	;	and	we	look	at	nature	,	we	look	at	 tree 	 s 	 	,	we	look	at	the	 can 	 opy 	 	,	and	we	communicate	,	and	 ex 	 change 	 	,	and	express	what	we	see	together	.
the	 result 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	fantastic	.
i	'll	just	give	you	a	few	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	fantastic	 install 	 ation 	 	by	bruce	chao	who	is	chair	of	the	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	and	glass	 blow 	 ing 	 	 depart 	 ment 	 	at	rhode	 is 	 land 	 	school	of	design	.
he	saw	 nest 	 s 	 	in	the	 can 	 opy 	 	at	one	of	our	 can 	 opy 	 	confluences	in	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	 north 	 west 	 	,	and	 create 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	.
we	've	had	dance	people	up	in	the	 can 	 opy 	 	.

they	made	a	fabulous	dance	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 bio 	 me 	 	.	``
they	 danc 	 ed 	 	in	the	forest	,	and	we	are	taking	 th 	 is 	 	dance	,	my	scientific	 out 	 reach 	 	 communication 	 s 	 	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	 link 	 ing 	 	up	with	 environment 	 al 	 	 group 	 s 	 	,	to	go	to	different	cities	and	to	perform	the	science	,	the	dance	and	the	 environment 	 al 	 	 out 	 reach 	 	that	we	hope	will	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
we	 br 	 ought 	 	 music 	 ians 	 	to	the	 can 	 opy 	 	,	and	they	made	 the 	 ir 	 	music	--	and	it	's	fantastic	music	.
we	had	 wood 	 en 	 	 flut 	 ists 	 	,	we	had	 obo 	 ists 	 	,	we	had	opera	 s 	 ing 	 ers 	 	,	we	had	guitar	 player 	 s 	 	,	and	we	had	rap	 s 	 ing 	 ers 	 	.
and	i	 br 	 ought 	 	a	little	segment	to	give	you	of	 du 	 ke 	 	brady	's	``	 can 	 opy 	 	rap	.	``
that	's	 du 	 ke 	 	!
 th 	 is 	 	experience	of	 work 	 ing 	 	with	 du 	 ke 	 	 al 	 so 	 	led	me	to	 initi 	 ate 	 	a	program	 call 	 ed 	 	sound	science	.
i	saw	the	power	of	 du 	 ke 	 	's	song	with	urban	youth	--	an	audience	,	you	know	,	i	 a 	 s 	 	a	middle	-	aged	professor	,	i	do	n't	have	a	hope	of	 get 	 ting 	 	to	--	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	convincing	them	of	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	 wild 	 land 	 s 	 	.
so	i	 engag 	 ed 	 	caution	,	 th 	 is 	 	rap	 s 	 ing 	 er 	 	,	with	a	group	of	young	people	from	inner	-	city	tacoma	.
we	went	out	to	the	forest	,	i	would	pick	up	a	branch	,	caution	would	rap	on	it	,	and	 sudden 	 ly 	 	that	branch	was	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	.
and	then	the	 student 	 s 	 	would	come	 in 	 to 	 	our	sound	 studio 	 s 	 	,	they	would	make	 the 	 ir 	 	own	rap	 song 	 s 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 beat 	 s 	 	.
they	 end 	 ed 	 	up	making	a	cd	which	they	took	home	to	 the 	 ir 	 	family	and	 friend 	 s 	 	,	 there 	 by 	 	 express 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 experience 	 s 	 	with	nature	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	medium	.
the	final	project	i	'll	talk	about	is	one	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	close	to	my	heart	,	and	it	 involve 	 s 	 	an	economic	and	social	value	that	is	 associate 	 d 	 	with	 epiph 	 y 	 tic 	 	 plant 	 s 	 	.
in	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	 north 	 west 	 	,	there	's	a	whole	industry	of	moss	-	 harvest 	 ing 	 	from	old	-	growth	 forest 	 s 	 	.
these	 moss 	 es 	 	are	taken	from	the	forest	;	they	're	used	by	the	 flor 	 i 	 culture 	 	industry	,	by	 flor 	 ists 	 	,	to	make	 arrange 	 ments 	 	and	make	 hang 	 ing 	 	 basket 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	265	million	dollar	industry	and	it	's	increasing	 rapid 	 ly 	 	.
if	you	remember	that	bald	guy	,	you	'll	know	that	what	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 strip 	 ped 	 	off	of	these	 trunk 	 s 	 	in	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	 north 	 west 	 	old	-	growth	forest	is	going	to	take	 decade 	 s 	 	and	 decade 	 s 	 	to	come	back	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	whole	industry	is	 un 	 sustain 	 able 	 	.
what	can	i	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	ecologist	,	do	about	that	?
well	,	my	thought	was	that	i	could	learn	how	to	grow	 moss 	 es 	 	,	and	that	way	we	would	n't	have	to	take	them	out	of	the	wild	.
and	i	thought	,	if	i	had	some	 partner 	 s 	 	that	could	help	me	with	 th 	 is 	 	,	that	would	be	great	.
and	so	,	i	thought	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 incarce 	 rated 	 	men	and	women	--	who	do	n't	have	access	to	nature	,	who	often	have	a	lot	of	time	,	they	often	have	space	,	and	you	do	n't	need	any	sharp	 tool 	 s 	 	to	work	with	 moss 	 es 	 	--	would	be	great	 partner 	 s 	 	.
and	they	have	 be 	 come 	 	 excel 	 lent 	 	 partner 	 s 	 	.
the	best	i	can	imagine	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 enthusiast 	 ic 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 enthusiast 	 ic 	 	about	the	work	.	they	 learn 	 ed 	 	how	to	distinguish	different	species	of	 moss 	 es 	 	,	which	,	to	tell	you	the	truth	,	is	a	lot	more	than	my	 under 	 graduate 	 	 student 	 s 	 	at	the	evergreen	college	can	do	.
and	they	 embrace 	 d 	 	the	idea	that	they	could	help	develop	a	research	design	in	order	to	grow	these	 moss 	 es 	 	.
we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 partner 	 s 	 	in	 figur 	 ing 	 	out	which	species	grow	the	 fast 	 est 	 	,	and	i	've	just	 be 	 en 	 	 overwhelm 	 ed 	 	with	how	 success 	 ful 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	 pri 	 son 	 	 ward 	 en 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 enthusiast 	 ic 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	a	science	and	 sustain 	 ability 	 	 semi 	 nar 	 	in	the	 pri 	 son 	 s 	 	.
i	 br 	 ought 	 	my	scientific	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	and	 sustain 	 ability 	 	 practitioner 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 pri 	 son 	 	.	we	 g 	 ave 	 	 talk 	 s 	 	once	a	month	,	and	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 implement 	 ing 	 	some	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 sustain 	 ability 	 	 project 	 s 	 	at	the	 pri 	 son 	 s 	 	--	 organ 	 ic 	 	 garden 	 s 	 	,	worm	culture	,	 recycl 	 ing 	 	,	water	 catch 	 ment 	 	and	 beekee 	 ping 	 	.
our	 lat 	 est 	 	endeavor	,	with	a	grant	from	the	 depart 	 ment 	 	of	 correct 	 ions 	 	at	washington	state	,	they	've	 ask 	 ed 	 	us	to	expand	 th 	 is 	 	program	to	three	more	 pri 	 son 	 s 	 	.
and	our	new	project	is	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	 in 	 mate 	 s 	 	and	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	learn	how	to	raise	the	oregon	 spot 	 ted 	 	frog	which	is	a	 high 	 ly 	 	 en 	 danger 	 ed 	 	 amphi 	 b 	 ian 	 	in	washington	state	and	oregon	.
so	they	will	raise	them	--	in	 captiv 	 ity 	 	,	of	course	--	from	 egg 	 s 	 	to	 tadpole 	 s 	 	and	 on 	 ward 	 	to	 frog 	 s 	 	.
and	they	will	have	the	pleasure	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	them	,	of	 see 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 frog 	 s 	 	that	they	've	raised	from	 egg 	 s 	 	and	 help 	 ed 	 	develop	,	 help 	 ed 	 	nurture	,	move	out	 in 	 to 	 	 protect 	 ed 	 	 wild 	 land 	 s 	 	to	augment	the	number	of	 en 	 danger 	 ed 	 	species	out	there	in	the	wild	.
and	so	,	i	think	for	 man 	 y 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	--	 eco 	 logical 	 	,	social	,	economic	and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	even	spiritual	--	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	tremendous	project	and	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	looking	forward	to	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 my 	 self 	 	and	my	 student 	 s 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	it	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	to	promote	and	teach	other	 scientist 	 s 	 	how	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	are	aware	,	the	world	of	academia	is	a	 ra 	 ther 	 	 in 	 ward 	 	-	looking	one	.
i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	help	 research 	 ers 	 	move	more	 out 	 ward 	 	to	have	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 partner 	 ship 	 s 	 	with	people	 out 	 side 	 	of	the	academic	community	.	and	so	i	'm	 hop 	 ing 	 	that	my	husband	jack	,	the	ant	 tax 	 onomist 	 	,	can	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	work	with	mattel	to	make	 tax 	 onomist 	 	ken	.
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	ben	zander	and	bill	 gate 	 s 	 	could	get	together	and	make	an	opera	about	 aid 	 s 	 	.
or	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	al	gore	and	 natural 	 ly 	 	7	could	make	a	song	about	climate	change	that	would	 re 	 ally 	 	make	you	clap	your	 hand 	 s 	 	.
so	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	it	's	a	little	bit	of	a	 fanta 	 s 	 y 	 	,	i	think	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	 re 	 ality 	 	.
 give 	 n 	 	the	 d 	 ures 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 feel 	 ing 	 	 environment 	 ally 	 	in	these	 time 	 s 	 	,	it	is	time	for	 scientist 	 s 	 	to	reach	 out 	 ward 	 	,	and	time	for	 t 	 hose 	 	 out 	 side 	 	of	science	to	reach	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	academia	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	my	 care 	 er 	 	with	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	the	 myster 	 ies 	 	of	 forest 	 s 	 	with	the	 tool 	 s 	 	of	science	.
by	making	these	 partner 	 ship 	 s 	 	that	i	 de 	 scribed 	 	to	you	,	i	have	 re 	 ally 	 	 open 	 ed 	 	my	mind	and	,	i	have	to	say	,	my	heart	to	have	a	 great 	 er 	 	 understand 	 ing 	 	,	to	make	other	 discover 	 ies 	 	about	nature	and	 my 	 self 	 	.
when	i	look	 in 	 to 	 	my	heart	,	i	see	 tree 	 s 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	an	image	of	a	real	heart	--	there	are	 tree 	 s 	 	in	our	 heart 	 s 	 	,	there	are	 tree 	 s 	 	in	your	 heart 	 s 	 	.
when	we	come	to	understand	nature	,	we	are	 touch 	 ing 	 	the	most	deep	,	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 part 	 s 	 	of	our	self	.
in	these	 partner 	 ship 	 s 	 	,	i	have	 al 	 so 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	people	tend	to	 compartment 	 al 	 ize 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 in 	 to 	 	it	people	,	and	movie	star	people	,	and	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	but	when	we	share	nature	,	when	we	share	our	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 s 	 	about	nature	,	we	find	a	common	 denomi 	 nator 	 	.
 final 	 ly 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	scientist	and	 a 	 s 	 	a	person	and	now	,	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	the	ted	community	,	i	feel	that	i	have	better	 tool 	 s 	 	to	go	out	to	 tree 	 s 	 	,	to	go	out	to	 forest 	 s 	 	,	to	go	out	to	nature	,	to	make	new	 discover 	 ies 	 	about	nature	--	and	about	 human 	 s 	 	'	place	in	nature	 where 	 ver 	 	we	are	and	 whom 	 ever 	 	you	are	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
