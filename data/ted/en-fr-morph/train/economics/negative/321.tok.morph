my	talk	is	``	flapping	 bird 	 s 	 	and	space	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	.	``
and	you	would	think	that	should	have	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	one	 an 	 other 	 	,	but	i	hope	by	the	end	of	these	18	 minute 	 s 	 	,	you	'll	see	a	little	bit	of	a	relation	.
it	ties	to	origami	.	so	let	me	start	.
what	is	origami	?
most	people	think	they	know	what	origami	is	.	it	's	 th 	 is 	 	:	flapping	 bird 	 s 	 	,	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	,	cootie	 catch 	 ers 	 	,	that	sort	of	thing	.
and	that	is	what	origami	used	to	be	.
but	it	's	 be 	 come 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
it	's	 be 	 come 	 	an	art	form	,	a	form	of	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	.
the	common	theme	--	what	 make 	 s 	 	it	origami	--	is	 fold 	 ing 	 	is	how	we	create	the	form	.
you	know	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	old	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	plate	from	1797	.
it	 show 	 s 	 	these	women	 play 	 ing 	 	with	these	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	.
if	you	look	close	,	it	's	 th 	 is 	 	shape	,	 call 	 ed 	 	a	 cr 	 ane 	 	.
every	japanese	kid	 learn 	 s 	 	how	to	fold	that	 cr 	 ane 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	art	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	around	for	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	you	would	think	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	around	that	long	--	so	 restrict 	 ive 	 	,	 fold 	 ing 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	--	 every 	 thing 	 	that	could	be	 d 	 one 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	a	long	time	ago	.
and	that	might	have	 be 	 en 	 	the	case	.
but	in	the	 t 	 went 	 ieth 	 	century	,	a	japanese	 fold 	 er 	 	named	yoshizawa	came	 a 	 long 	 	,	and	he	 create 	 d 	 	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	new	 design 	 s 	 	.
but	even	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	he	 create 	 d 	 	a	language	,	a	way	we	could	communicate	,	a	code	of	 dot 	 s 	 	,	 d 	 ashes 	 	and	 arrow 	 s 	 	.
harkening	back	to	susan	blackmore	's	talk	,	we	now	have	a	 mean 	 s 	 	of	 transmit 	 ting 	 	information	with	 her 	 ed 	 ity 	 	and	 s 	 election 	 	,	and	we	know	where	that	 lead 	 s 	 	.
and	where	it	 ha 	 s 	 	led	in	origami	is	to	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	origami	figure	--	one	sheet	,	no	 cut 	 s 	 	,	 fold 	 ing 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	,	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 fold 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	,	too	,	is	origami	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 show 	 s 	 	where	we	've	gone	in	the	modern	world	.
 natural 	 ism 	 	.	detail	.
you	can	get	 horn 	 s 	 	,	 ant 	 ler 	 s 	 	--	even	,	if	you	look	close	,	 cl 	 oven 	 	 hoo 	 ves 	 	.
and	it	 raise 	 s 	 	a	question	:	what	 change 	 d 	 	?
and	what	 change 	 d 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	you	might	not	have	 expect 	 ed 	 	in	an	art	,	which	is	math	.
that	is	,	people	 appli 	 ed 	 	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 principle 	 s 	 	to	the	art	,	to	discover	the	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	 law 	 s 	 	.
and	that	 lead 	 s 	 	to	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	tool	.
the	secret	to	 product 	 ivity 	 	in	so	 man 	 y 	 	 field 	 s 	 	--	and	in	origami	--	is	 lett 	 ing 	 	dead	people	do	your	work	for	you	.
 be 	 cause 	 	what	you	can	do	is	take	your	problem	,	and	turn	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	problem	that	 some 	 one 	 	else	 ha 	 s 	 	 solve 	 d 	 	,	and	use	 the 	 ir 	 	 solution 	 s 	 	.
and	i	want	to	tell	you	how	we	did	that	in	origami	.
origami	 r 	 evolve 	 s 	 	around	crease	 pattern 	 s 	 	.
the	crease	pattern	 show 	 n 	 	here	is	the	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	 blue 	 print 	 	for	an	origami	figure	.
and	you	ca	n't	just	draw	them	 arbitr 	 arily 	 	.
they	have	to	obey	four	simple	 law 	 s 	 	.
and	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	,	easy	to	understand	.
the	first	law	is	two	-	colorability	.	you	can	color	any	crease	pattern	with	just	two	 color 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	ever	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	same	color	 meet 	 ing 	 	.
the	 direction 	 s 	 	of	the	 fold 	 s 	 	at	any	 vert 	 ex 	 	--	the	number	of	mountain	 fold 	 s 	 	,	the	number	of	 val 	 ley 	 	 fold 	 s 	 	--	 al 	 ways 	 	 differ 	 s 	 	by	two	.	two	more	or	two	less	.
 noth 	 ing 	 	else	.
if	you	look	at	the	 angle 	 s 	 	around	the	fold	,	you	find	that	if	you	number	the	 angle 	 s 	 	in	a	circle	,	all	the	even	-	 number 	 ed 	 	 angle 	 s 	 	add	up	to	a	straight	line	,
all	the	odd	-	 number 	 ed 	 	 angle 	 s 	 	add	up	to	a	straight	line	.
and	if	you	look	at	how	the	 layer 	 s 	 	stack	,	you	'll	find	that	no	matter	how	you	stack	 fold 	 s 	 	and	 sheet 	 s 	 	,	a	sheet	can	never	penetrate	a	fold	.
so	that	's	four	simple	 law 	 s 	 	.	that	's	all	you	need	in	origami	.
all	of	origami	 come 	 s 	 	from	that	.
and	you	'd	think	,	``	can	four	simple	 law 	 s 	 	give	rise	to	that	kind	of	 complex 	 ity 	 	?	``
but	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	the	 law 	 s 	 	of	 quant 	 um 	 	 mechanic 	 s 	 	can	be	written	down	on	a	napkin	,	and	yet	they	govern	all	of	 chemist 	 ry 	 	,	all	of	life	,	all	of	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
if	we	obey	these	 law 	 s 	 	,	we	can	do	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
so	in	origami	,	to	obey	these	 law 	 s 	 	,	we	can	take	simple	 pattern 	 s 	 	--	like	 th 	 is 	 	 repeat 	 ing 	 	pattern	of	 fold 	 s 	 	,	 call 	 ed 	 	 text 	 ures 	 	--	and	by	 it 	 self 	 	it	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
but	if	we	follow	the	 law 	 s 	 	of	origami	,	we	can	put	these	 pattern 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 an 	 other 	 	fold	that	 it 	 self 	 	might	be	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	,
but	when	we	put	it	together	,	we	get	 some 	 thing 	 	a	little	different	.
 th 	 is 	 	fish	,	400	 scale 	 s 	 	--	 aga 	 in 	 	,	it	is	one	 un 	 cut 	 	square	,	 on 	 ly 	 	 fold 	 ing 	 	.
and	if	you	do	n't	want	to	fold	400	 scale 	 s 	 	,	you	can	back	off	and	just	do	a	few	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	add	 plate 	 s 	 	to	the	back	of	a	turtle	,	or	 to 	 es 	 	.
or	you	can	ramp	up	and	go	up	to	50	 star 	 s 	 	on	a	flag	,	with	13	 strip 	 es 	 	.
and	if	you	want	to	go	 re 	 ally 	 	crazy	,	1,000	 scale 	 s 	 	on	a	 rattle 	 snake 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	guy	's	on	 dis 	 play 	 	 down 	 stair 	 s 	 	,	so	take	a	look	if	you	get	a	chance	.
the	most	 power 	 ful 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	in	origami	have	related	to	how	we	get	 part 	 s 	 	of	 creature 	 s 	 	.
and	i	can	put	it	in	 th 	 is 	 	simple	 equ 	 ation 	 	.	we	take	an	idea	,	combine	it	with	a	square	,	and	you	get	an	origami	figure	.
what	 matter 	 s 	 	is	what	we	mean	by	 t 	 hose 	 	 symbol 	 s 	 	.
and	you	might	say	,	``	can	you	 re 	 ally 	 	be	that	specific	?
i	mean	,	a	stag	beetle	--	it	's	got	two	 point 	 s 	 	for	 jaw 	 s 	 	,	it	's	got	 antenna 	 e 	 	.	can	you	be	that	specific	in	the	detail	?	``
and	 yea 	 h 	 	,	you	 re 	 ally 	 	can	.
so	how	do	we	do	that	?	well	,	we	break	it	down	 in 	 to 	 	a	few	 small 	 er 	 	 step 	 s 	 	.
so	let	me	stretch	out	that	 equ 	 ation 	 	.
i	start	with	my	idea	.	i	abstract	it	.
what	's	the	most	abstract	form	?	it	's	a	stick	figure	.
and	from	that	stick	figure	,	i	 some 	 how 	 	have	to	get	to	a	 fold 	 ed 	 	shape	that	 ha 	 s 	 	a	part	for	every	bit	of	the	subject	,
a	flap	for	every	leg	.
and	then	once	i	have	that	 fold 	 ed 	 	shape	that	we	call	the	base	,	you	can	make	the	 leg 	 s 	 	 narrow 	 er 	 	,	you	can	bend	them	,	you	can	turn	it	 in 	 to 	 	the	 finish 	 ed 	 	shape	.
now	the	first	step	,	 pre 	 tty 	 	easy	.
take	an	idea	,	draw	a	stick	figure	.
the	last	step	is	not	so	hard	,	but	that	middle	step	--	going	from	the	abstract	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	to	the	 fold 	 ed 	 	shape	--	that	's	hard	.
but	that	's	the	place	where	the	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	can	get	us	over	the	hump	.
and	i	'm	going	to	show	you	all	how	to	do	that	so	you	can	go	out	of	here	and	fold	 some 	 thing 	 	.
but	we	're	going	to	start	small	.
 th 	 is 	 	base	 ha 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	 flap 	 s 	 	in	it	.
we	're	going	to	learn	how	to	make	one	flap	.
how	would	you	make	a	single	flap	?
take	a	square	.	fold	it	in	half	,	fold	it	in	half	,	fold	it	 aga 	 in 	 	,
 un 	 til 	 	it	 get 	 s 	 	long	and	narrow	,	and	then	we	'll	say	at	the	end	of	that	,	that	's	a	flap	.
i	could	use	that	for	a	leg	,	an	arm	,	 any 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
what	paper	went	 in 	 to 	 	that	flap	?
well	,	if	i	 un 	 fold 	 	it	and	go	back	to	the	crease	pattern	,	you	can	see	that	the	upper	left	corner	of	that	shape	is	the	paper	that	went	 in 	 to 	 	the	flap	.
so	that	's	the	flap	,	and	all	the	rest	of	the	paper	's	left	over	.
i	can	use	it	for	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
well	,	there	are	other	ways	of	making	a	flap	.
there	are	other	 dimension 	 s 	 	for	 flap 	 s 	 	.
if	i	make	the	 flap 	 s 	 	 skin 	 ni 	 er 	 	,	i	can	use	a	bit	less	paper	.
if	i	make	the	flap	 a 	 s 	 	 skin 	 ny 	 	 a 	 s 	 	possible	,	i	get	to	the	limit	of	the	 minim 	 um 	 	amount	of	paper	 need 	 ed 	 	.
and	you	can	see	there	,	it	 need 	 s 	 	a	quarter	-	circle	of	paper	to	make	a	flap	.
there	's	other	ways	of	making	 flap 	 s 	 	.
if	i	put	the	flap	on	the	edge	,	it	uses	a	half	circle	of	paper	.
and	if	i	make	the	flap	from	the	middle	,	it	uses	a	full	circle	.
so	,	no	matter	how	i	make	a	flap	,	it	 need 	 s 	 	some	part	of	a	 circul 	 ar 	 	region	of	paper	.
so	now	we	're	ready	to	scale	up	.
what	if	i	want	to	make	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	 flap 	 s 	 	?
what	do	i	need	?	i	need	a	lot	of	 circle 	 s 	 	.
and	in	the	1990s	,	origami	 artist 	 s 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	these	 principle 	 s 	 	and	 real 	 ized 	 	we	could	make	 arbitr 	 arily 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	 figure 	 s 	 	just	by	 pack 	 ing 	 	 circle 	 s 	 	.
and	here	's	where	the	dead	people	start	to	help	us	out	,
 be 	 cause 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	people	have	 stud 	 ied 	 	the	problem	of	 pack 	 ing 	 	 circle 	 s 	 	.
i	can	 re 	 ly 	 	on	that	vast	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 mathematic 	 ians 	 	and	 artist 	 s 	 	looking	at	 dis 	 c 	 	 pack 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	 arrange 	 ments 	 	.
and	i	can	use	 t 	 hose 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	now	to	create	origami	 shape 	 s 	 	.
so	we	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	these	 rule 	 s 	 	 where 	 by 	 	you	pack	 circle 	 s 	 	,	you	 decor 	 ate 	 	the	 pattern 	 s 	 	of	 circle 	 s 	 	with	lines	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	more	 rule 	 s 	 	.	that	 give 	 s 	 	you	the	 fold 	 s 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	 fold 	 s 	 	fold	 in 	 to 	 	a	base	.	you	shape	the	base	.
you	get	a	 fold 	 ed 	 	shape	--	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	a	 cock 	 roach 	 	.
and	it	's	so	simple	.
it	's	so	simple	that	a	computer	could	do	it	.
and	you	say	,	``	well	,	you	know	,	how	simple	is	that	?	``
but	 computer 	 s 	 	--	you	need	to	be	able	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	in	 ver 	 y 	 	 bas 	 ic 	 	 term 	 s 	 	,	and	with	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	could	.
so	i	wrote	a	computer	program	a	bunch	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	 call 	 ed 	 	treemaker	,	and	you	can	download	it	from	my	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
it	's	free	.	it	 run 	 s 	 	on	all	the	major	 platform 	 s 	 	--	even	 window 	 s 	 	.
and	you	just	draw	a	stick	figure	,	and	it	 calcul 	 ates 	 	the	crease	pattern	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	the	circle	 pack 	 ing 	 	,	 calcul 	 ates 	 	the	crease	pattern	,	and	if	you	use	that	stick	figure	that	i	just	 show 	 ed 	 	--	which	you	can	kind	of	tell	,	it	's	a	 de 	 er 	 	,	it	's	got	 ant 	 ler 	 s 	 	--	you	'll	get	 th 	 is 	 	crease	pattern	.
and	if	you	take	 th 	 is 	 	crease	pattern	,	you	fold	on	the	 dot 	 ted 	 	lines	,	you	'll	get	a	base	that	you	can	then	shape	 in 	 to 	 	a	 de 	 er 	 	,	with	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	crease	pattern	that	you	 want 	 ed 	 	.
and	if	you	want	a	different	 de 	 er 	 	,	not	a	white	-	tailed	 de 	 er 	 	,	but	you	want	a	mule	 de 	 er 	 	,	or	an	 el 	 k 	 	,	you	change	the	 pack 	 ing 	 	,	and	you	can	do	an	 el 	 k 	 	.
or	you	could	do	a	 mo 	 ose 	 	.
or	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	any	other	kind	of	 de 	 er 	 	.
these	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	 revolution 	 ized 	 	 th 	 is 	 	art	.
we	found	we	could	do	 insect 	 s 	 	,	 spider 	 s 	 	,	which	are	close	,	 thing 	 s 	 	with	 leg 	 s 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	with	 leg 	 s 	 	and	 wing 	 s 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	with	 leg 	 s 	 	and	 antenna 	 e 	 	.
and	if	 fold 	 ing 	 	a	single	 pray 	 ing 	 	mantis	from	a	single	 un 	 cut 	 	square	was	n't	 interest 	 ing 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	then	you	could	do	two	 pray 	 ing 	 	 mantis 	 es 	 	from	a	single	 un 	 cut 	 	square	.
she	's	eating	him	.
i	call	it	``	snack	time	.	``
and	you	can	do	more	than	just	 insect 	 s 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	--	you	can	put	 detail 	 s 	 	,	 to 	 es 	 	and	 claw 	 s 	 	.	a	 grizz 	 ly 	 	bear	 ha 	 s 	 	 claw 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	tree	frog	 ha 	 s 	 	 to 	 es 	 	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 lot 	 s 	 	of	people	in	origami	now	put	 to 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 model 	 s 	 	.
 to 	 es 	 	have	 be 	 come 	 	an	origami	meme	,
 be 	 cause 	 	 every 	 one 	 	's	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
you	can	make	 multi 	 ple 	 	 subject 	 s 	 	.
so	these	are	a	couple	of	 instrument 	 alist 	 s 	 	.
the	guitar	player	from	a	single	square	,	the	 bas 	 s 	 	player	from	a	single	square	.
and	if	you	say	,	``	well	,	but	the	guitar	,	 bas 	 s 	 	--	that	's	not	so	hot	.
do	a	little	more	 complic 	 ated 	 	instrument	.	``
well	,	then	you	could	do	an	organ	.
and	what	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 allow 	 ed 	 	is	the	creation	of	origami	-	on	-	demand	.
so	now	people	can	say	,	``	i	want	 exact 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	and	 th 	 is 	 	and	 th 	 is 	 	,	``	and	you	can	go	out	and	fold	it	.
and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	you	create	high	art	,	and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	you	pay	the	 bill 	 s 	 	by	 do 	 ing 	 	some	commercial	work	.
but	i	want	to	show	you	some	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
 every 	 thing 	 	you	'll	see	here	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	the	car	,	is	origami	.
just	to	show	you	,	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	was	 fold 	 ed 	 	paper	.
 computer 	 s 	 	made	 thing 	 s 	 	move	,	but	these	 we 	 re 	 	all	real	,	 fold 	 ed 	 	 object 	 s 	 	that	we	made	.
and	we	can	use	 th 	 is 	 	not	just	for	 visual 	 s 	 	,	but	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	be	 use 	 ful 	 	even	in	the	real	world	.
 surprising 	 ly 	 	,	origami	and	the	 structure 	 s 	 	that	we	've	 develop 	 ed 	 	in	origami	turn	out	to	have	 application 	 s 	 	in	medicine	,	in	science	,	in	space	,	in	the	body	,	consumer	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	and	more	.
and	i	want	to	show	you	some	of	these	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
one	of	the	 ear 	 liest 	 	was	 th 	 is 	 	pattern	,	 th 	 is 	 	 fold 	 ed 	 	pattern	,	 stud 	 ied 	 	by	koryo	miura	,	a	japanese	engineer	.
he	 stud 	 ied 	 	a	 fold 	 ing 	 	pattern	,	and	 real 	 ized 	 	 th 	 is 	 	could	fold	down	 in 	 to 	 	an	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	compact	package	that	had	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 open 	 ing 	 	and	 clo 	 s 	 ing 	 	structure	.
and	he	used	it	to	design	 th 	 is 	 	solar	array	.
it	's	an	artist	's	 rend 	 ition 	 	,	but	it	flew	in	a	japanese	 tele 	 scope 	 	in	1995	.
now	,	there	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	little	origami	in	the	james	webb	space	 tele 	 scope 	 	,	but	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	.
the	 tele 	 scope 	 	,	going	up	in	space	,	it	 un 	 fold 	 s 	 	in	two	 place 	 s 	 	.
it	 fold 	 s 	 	in	 third 	 s 	 	.	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	pattern	--	you	would	n't	even	call	that	origami	.
they	 certain 	 ly 	 	did	n't	need	to	talk	to	origami	 artist 	 s 	 	.
but	if	you	want	to	go	 high 	 er 	 	and	go	 large 	 r 	 	than	 th 	 is 	 	,	then	you	might	need	some	origami	.
 engineer 	 s 	 	at	lawrence	livermore	national	lab	had	an	idea	for	a	 tele 	 scope 	 	much	 large 	 r 	 	.
they	 call 	 ed 	 	it	the	eyeglass	.
the	design	 call 	 ed 	 	for	 geo 	 synchron 	 ous 	 	orbit	25,000	 mile 	 s 	 	up	,	100	-	meter	 dia 	 meter 	 	lens	.
so	,	imagine	a	lens	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	 foot 	 ball 	 	field	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	two	 group 	 s 	 	of	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	:	planetary	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	who	want	to	look	up	,	and	then	other	people	,	who	 want 	 ed 	 	to	look	down	.
 whet 	 her 	 	you	look	up	or	look	down	,	how	do	you	get	it	up	in	space	?	you	've	got	to	get	it	up	there	in	a	rocket	.
and	 rocket 	 s 	 	are	small	.	so	you	have	to	make	it	 small 	 er 	 	.
how	do	you	make	a	large	sheet	of	glass	 small 	 er 	 	?
well	,	about	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	is	to	fold	it	up	 some 	 how 	 	.
so	you	have	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	small	model	.
 fold 	 ed 	 	lens	,	you	divide	up	the	 pan 	 el 	 s 	 	,	you	add	 flex 	 ures 	 	.	but	 th 	 is 	 	pattern	's	not	going	to	work	to	get	 some 	 thing 	 	100	 meter 	 s 	 	down	to	a	few	 meter 	 s 	 	.
so	the	livermore	 engineer 	 s 	 	,	 want 	 ing 	 	to	make	use	of	the	work	of	dead	people	,	or	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	live	 origami 	 st 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	let	's	see	if	 some 	 one 	 	else	is	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	thing	.	``
so	they	 look 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	origami	community	,	we	got	in	touch	with	them	,	and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	with	them	.
and	we	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	pattern	together	that	 scale 	 s 	 	to	 arbitr 	 arily 	 	large	 s 	 ize 	 	,	but	that	 allow 	 s 	 	any	flat	ring	or	 dis 	 c 	 	to	fold	down	 in 	 to 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	neat	,	compact	cylinder	.
and	they	 adopt 	 ed 	 	that	for	 the 	 ir 	 	first	generation	,	which	was	not	100	 meter 	 s 	 	--	it	was	a	five	-	meter	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	five	-	meter	 tele 	 scope 	 	--	 ha 	 s 	 	about	a	quarter	-	mile	 f 	 oc 	 al 	 	length	.
and	it	 work 	 s 	 	 perfect 	 ly 	 	on	 it 	 s 	 	test	range	,	and	it	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	 fold 	 s 	 	up	 in 	 to 	 	a	neat	little	 bundl 	 e 	 	.
now	,	there	is	other	origami	in	space	.
japan	 aero 	 space 	 	[	exploration	]	 age 	 ncy 	 	flew	a	solar	sail	,	and	you	can	see	here	that	the	sail	 expand 	 s 	 	out	,	and	you	can	still	see	the	fold	lines	.
the	problem	that	's	 be 	 ing 	 	 solve 	 d 	 	here	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	big	and	sheet	-	like	at	 it 	 s 	 	destination	,	but	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	small	for	the	journey	.
and	that	 work 	 s 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	you	're	going	 in 	 to 	 	space	,	or	 whet 	 her 	 	you	're	just	going	 in 	 to 	 	a	body	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	is	the	 lat 	 ter 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	heart	 s 	 tent 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	by	zhong	you	at	oxford	university	.
it	 hold 	 s 	 	open	a	 block 	 ed 	 	 art 	 ery 	 	when	it	 get 	 s 	 	to	 it 	 s 	 	destination	,	but	it	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	much	 small 	 er 	 	for	the	trip	there	,	through	your	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 tent 	 	 fold 	 s 	 	down	using	an	origami	pattern	,	based	on	a	model	 call 	 ed 	 	the	water	bomb	base	.
airbag	 design 	 ers 	 	 al 	 so 	 	have	the	problem	of	 get 	 ting 	 	flat	 sheet 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	small	space	.
and	they	want	to	do	 the 	 ir 	 	design	by	 simul 	 ation 	 	.
so	they	need	to	figure	out	how	,	in	a	computer	,	to	flatten	an	airbag	.
and	the	 algorithm 	 s 	 	that	we	 develop 	 ed 	 	to	do	 insect 	 s 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	the	solution	for	 airbag 	 s 	 	to	do	 the 	 ir 	 	 simul 	 ation 	 	.
and	so	they	can	do	a	 simul 	 ation 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	origami	 crease 	 s 	 	 form 	 ing 	 	,	and	now	you	can	see	the	airbag	 infla 	 te 	 	and	find	out	,	 do 	 es 	 	it	work	?
and	that	 lead 	 s 	 	to	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	idea	.
you	know	,	where	did	these	 thing 	 s 	 	come	from	?
well	,	the	heart	 s 	 tent 	 	came	from	that	little	blow	-	up	box	that	you	might	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	in	 element 	 ary 	 	school	.
it	's	the	same	pattern	,	 call 	 ed 	 	the	water	bomb	base	.
the	airbag	-	 flatten 	 ing 	 	algorithm	came	from	all	the	 develop 	 ments 	 	of	circle	 pack 	 ing 	 	and	the	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	that	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	just	to	create	 insect 	 s 	 	--	 thing 	 s 	 	with	 leg 	 s 	 	.
the	thing	is	,	that	 th 	 is 	 	often	 happen 	 s 	 	in	math	and	science	.
when	you	get	math	 involve 	 d 	 	,	 problem 	 s 	 	that	you	solve	for	aesthetic	value	 on 	 ly 	 	,	or	to	create	 some 	 thing 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	turn	around	and	turn	out	to	have	an	application	in	the	real	world	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	weird	and	surprising	 a 	 s 	 	it	may	sound	,	origami	may	 some 	 day 	 	even	 s 	 ave 	 	a	life	.
 thank 	 s 	 	.
