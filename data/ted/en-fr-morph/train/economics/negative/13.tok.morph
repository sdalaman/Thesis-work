when	i	was	14	my	 parent 	 s 	 	 b 	 ought 	 	me	a	 chemist 	 ry 	 	set

so	,	i	made	a	hydrogen	 gene 	 rator 	 	and	i	made	an	oxygen	 gene 	 rator 	 	,
and	i	had	the	two	 pipe 	 s 	 	 lead 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 beak 	 er 	 	and	i	threw	a	match	in	.

richard	saul	wurman	:	 re 	 ally 	 	?

rsw	:	...	huh	.	i	'd	like	to	start	 th 	 is 	 	session	 aga 	 in 	 	.
the	 gentle 	 man 	 	to	my	left	is	the	 ver 	 y 	 	famous	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 over 	 ly 	 	famous	,	frank	gehry	.	and	frank	,	you	've	come	to	a	place	in	your	life	,	which	is	 astonish 	 ing 	 	.	i	mean	it	is	 astonish 	 ing 	 	for	an	artist	,	for	an	architect	,	to	 be 	 come 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	an	icon	and	a	legend	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	time	.	i	mean	you	have	 be 	 come 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	you	can	 gig 	 gle 	 	at	it	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	a	funny	...	you	know	,	it	's	a	strange	thought	,
but	your	building	is	an	icon	--
you	can	draw	a	little	picture	of	that	building	,	it	can	be	used	in	 ad 	 s 	 	--
and	you	've	had	not	rock	star	 stat 	 us 	 	,	but	 celebr 	 ity 	 	 stat 	 us 	 	in	 do 	 ing 	 	what	you	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	for	most	of	your	life	.
and	i	know	the	road	was	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	difficult	.
and	it	did	n't	seem	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	,	that	your	sell	 out 	 s 	 	,	 what 	 ever 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	,	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	big	.
you	 ke 	 pt 	 	moving	 a 	 head 	 	in	a	life	where	you	're	dependent	on	 work 	 ing 	 	for	 some 	 body 	 	.
but	that	's	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	for	a	creative	person	.
a	lot	of	us	work	for	people	;
we	're	in	the	 hand 	 s 	 	of	other	people	.
and	that	's	one	of	the	great	 dilemma 	 s 	 	--	we	're	in	a	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	session	--	it	's	one	of	the	great	 dilemma 	 s 	 	in	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	:	how	to	do	work	that	's	big	 en 	 ough 	 	and	not	sell	out	.
and	you	've	 achiev 	 ed 	 	that
and	that	 make 	 s 	 	your	win	 doub 	 ly 	 	big	,	 trip 	 ly 	 	big	.
it	's	not	 quit 	 e 	 	a	question	but	you	can	comment	on	it	.	it	's	a	big	issue	.
fg	:	well	,	i	've	 al 	 ways 	 	just	...	i	've	never	 re 	 ally 	 	gone	out	looking	for	work	.
i	 al 	 ways 	 	 wait 	 ed 	 	for	it	to	sort	of	hit	me	on	the	head	.
and	when	i	 start 	 ed 	 	out	,	i	thought	that	 architect 	 ure 	 	was	a	service	business	and	that	you	had	to	 pleas 	 e 	 	the	 client 	 s 	 	and	stuff	.
and	i	 real 	 ized 	 	when	i	'd	come	 in 	 to 	 	the	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	with	these	 cor 	 rug 	 ated 	 	metal	and	chain	link	stuff	,	and	people	would	just	look	at	me	like	i	'd	just	 land 	 ed 	 	from	mars	.	but	i	could	n't	do	 any 	 thing 	 	else	.
that	was	my	 respons 	 e 	 	to	the	people	in	the	time	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	it	was	 respond 	 ing 	 	to	 client 	 s 	 	that	i	had	who	did	n't	have	 ver 	 y 	 	much	money	,	so	they	could	n't	afford	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
i	think	it	was	 circum 	 stantial 	 	.
 un 	 til 	 	i	got	to	my	house	,	where	the	client	was	my	wife	.
we	 b 	 ought 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 tin 	 y 	 	little	bungalow	in	santa	monica	and	for	like	50	grand	i	built	a	house	around	it	.	and	a	few	people	got	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	it	.
i	was	 visit 	 ing 	 	with	an	artist	,	michael	heizer	,	out	in	the	desert	near	las	vegas	 some 	 where 	 	.
he	's	building	 th 	 is 	 	huge	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	place	.
and	it	was	late	in	the	 even 	 ing 	 	.	we	'd	had	a	lot	to	drink	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 stand 	 ing 	 	out	in	the	desert	all	 al 	 one 	 	and	,	 think 	 ing 	 	about	my	house	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	did	it	ever	occur	to	you	if	you	built	stuff	more	permanent	,	 some 	 where 	 	in	2000	 year 	 s 	 	 some 	 body 	 	's	going	to	like	it	?	``
so	,	i	thought	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	,	that	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	a	good	idea	.	``
 luck 	 ily 	 	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	get	some	 client 	 s 	 	that	had	a	little	more	money	,	so	the	stuff	was	a	little	more	permanent	.
but	i	just	found	out	the	world	ai	n't	going	to	last	that	long	,
 th 	 is 	 	guy	was	 tell 	 ing 	 	us	the	other	day	.
so	where	do	we	go	now	?
back	to	--	 every 	 thing 	 	's	so	 tempor 	 ary 	 	.
i	do	n't	see	it	the	way	you	 character 	 ized 	 	it	.
for	me	,	every	day	is	a	new	thing	.
i	approach	each	project	with	a	new	 in 	 security 	 	,	 al 	 most 	 	like	the	first	project	i	ever	did	,	and	i	get	the	 sweat 	 s 	 	,	i	go	in	and	start	 work 	 ing 	 	,	i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	where	i	'm	going	--
if	i	 k 	 new 	 	where	i	was	going	,	i	would	n't	do	it	.
when	i	can	predict	or	plan	it	,	i	do	n't	do	it	.	i	 dis 	 card 	 	it	.
so	i	approach	it	with	the	same	 trepid 	 ation 	 	.
 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	over	time	i	have	a	lot	more	confidence	that	it	's	going	to	be	ok	.
i	do	run	a	kind	of	a	business	--
i	've	got	120	people
and	you	've	got	to	pay	them	,
so	there	's	a	lot	of	 respons 	 ibility 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	--
but	the	actual	work	on	the	project	is	with	,	i	think	,	a	 health 	 y 	 	 in 	 security 	 	.
and	like	the	playwright	 s 	 aid 	 	the	other	day	--	i	could	 re 	 late 	 	to	him	:	you	're	not	 s 	 ure 	 	.
when	bilbao	was	 finish 	 ed 	 	and	i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	it	,	i	saw	all	the	 mistak 	 es 	 	,	i	saw	...
they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 mistak 	 es 	 	;
i	saw	 every 	 thing 	 	that	i	would	have	 change 	 d 	 
and	i	was	 embarrass 	 ed 	 	by	it	.
i	felt	an	 embarrass 	 ment 	 	--	``	how	could	i	have	 d 	 one 	 	that	?
how	could	i	have	made	 shape 	 s 	 	like	that	or	 d 	 one 	 	stuff	like	that	?	``
it	's	taken	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 year 	 s 	 	to	now	look	at	it	 detach 	 ed 	 	and	say	--	 a 	 s 	 	you	walk	around	the	corner	and	a	piece	of	it	 work 	 s 	 	with	the	road	and	the	street	,	and	it	 appear 	 s 	 	to	have	a	relationship	--	that	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	like	it	.
rsw	:	what	's	the	 stat 	 us 	 	of	the	new	york	project	?
fg	:	i	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	know	.
tom	krens	came	to	me	with	bilbao	and	 explain 	 ed 	 	it	all	to	me	,	and	i	thought	he	was	nuts	.	i	did	n't	think	he	 k 	 new 	 	what	he	was	 do 	 ing 	 	,
and	he	 pull 	 ed 	 	it	off	.
so	,	i	think	he	's	icarus	and	phoenix	all	in	one	guy	.
he	 get 	 s 	 	up	there	and	then	he	...	 come 	 s 	 	back	up	.
they	're	still	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	it	.
september	11	generated	some	interest	in	moving	it	over	to	ground	zero	,
and	i	'm	 total 	 ly 	 	against	that	.
i	just	feel	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	or	building	 any 	 thing 	 	on	ground	zero
i	think	for	a	long	time	.
rsw	:	the	picture	on	the	screen	,	is	that	disney	?
fg	:	 yea 	 h 	 	.
rsw	:	how	much	further	 a 	 long 	 	is	it	than	that	,	and	when	will	that	be	 finish 	 ed 	 	?
fg	:	that	will	be	 finish 	 ed 	 	in	2003	--	september	,	october	--
and	i	'm	 hop 	 ing 	 	kyu	,	and	herbie	,	and	yo	-	yo	and	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	come	play	with	us	at	that	place	.
 luck 	 ily 	 	,	 to 	 day 	 	most	of	the	people	i	'm	 work 	 ing 	 	with	are	people	i	 re 	 ally 	 	like	.
richard	koshalek	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	one	of	the	main	 reason 	 s 	 	that	disney	hall	came	to	me	.
he	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	 cheer 	 lead 	 er 	 	for	 quit 	 e 	 	a	long	time	.
there	are	n't	 man 	 y 	 	people	around	that	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	with	 architect 	 ure 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 client 	 s 	 	.
if	you	think	about	the	world	,	and	even	just	in	 th 	 is 	 	audience	,	most	of	us	are	 involve 	 d 	 	with	 building 	 s 	 	.
 noth 	 ing 	 	that	you	would	call	 architect 	 ure 	 	,	right	?
and	so	to	find	one	,	a	guy	like	that	,	you	hang	on	to	him	.
he	's	 be 	 come 	 	the	head	of	art	center	,	and	there	's	a	building	by	craig	ellwood	there	.
i	 k 	 new 	 	craig	and	 respect 	 ed 	 	him	.
they	want	to	add	to	it
and	it	's	hard	to	add	to	a	building	like	that	--
it	's	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	 minimal 	 ist 	 	,	black	steel	building	--	and	richard	 want 	 s 	 	to	add	a	library	and	more	student	stuff
and	it	's	a	lot	of	 acre 	 age 	 	.
i	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	him	to	let	me	 br 	 ing 	 	in	 an 	 other 	 	architect	from	portugal	:	alvaro	siza	.	rsw	:	why	did	you	want	that	?
fg	:	i	 k 	 new 	 	you	'd	ask	that	question	.	it	was	intuitive	.	alvaro	siza	grew	up	and	lived	in	portugal	and	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	 consider 	 ed 	 	the	portuguese	main	guy	in	 architect 	 ure 	 	.
i	 visit 	 ed 	 	with	him	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	and	he	 show 	 ed 	 	me	his	early	work	,
and	his	early	work	had	a	 re 	 semblance 	 	to	my	early	work	.
when	i	came	out	of	college	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	try	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	 contextual 	 ly 	 	in	southern	california	,
and	you	got	 in 	 to 	 	the	logic	of	spanish	colonial	tile	 roof 	 s 	 	and	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	.
i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	understand	that	language	 a 	 s 	 	a	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	place	to	jump	off	,
and	there	was	so	much	of	it	 be 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	by	spec	 build 	 ers 	 	and	it	was	 trivial 	 ized 	 	so	much	that	it	was	n't	...	i	just	 stop 	 ped 	 	.
i	mean	,	charlie	moore	did	a	bunch	of	it	,	but	it	did	n't	feel	good	to	me	.
siza	,	on	the	other	hand	,	 continu 	 ed 	 	in	portugal	where	the	real	stuff	was	and	 evolv 	 ed 	 	a	modern	language	that	 relat 	 es 	 	to	that	historic	language	.
and	i	 al 	 ways 	 	felt	that	he	should	come	to	southern	california	and	do	a	building	.
i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	get	him	a	couple	of	 job 	 s 	 	and	they	did	n't	pan	out	.
i	like	the	idea	of	 collabor 	 ation 	 	with	people	like	that	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 push 	 es 	 	you	.
i	've	 d 	 one 	 	it	with	claes	oldenburg	and	with	richard	serra	,	who	 do 	 es 	 	n't	think	 architect 	 ure 	 	is	art	.
did	you	see	that	thing	?
rsw	:	no	.	what	did	he	say	?
fg	:	he	 call 	 s 	 	 architect 	 ure 	 	``	 plumb 	 ing 	 	.	``	fg	:	 any 	 way 	 	,	the	siza	thing	.
it	's	a	 rich 	 er 	 	experience	.
it	must	be	like	that	for	kyu	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	with	 music 	 ians 	 	--
it	's	similar	to	that	i	would	imagine	--
where	you	...	huh	?
audience	:	liquid	 architect 	 ure 	 	.
fg	:	liquid	 architect 	 ure 	 	.
where	you	...	it	's	like	jazz	:	you	 improv 	 ise 	 	,	you	work	together	,	you	play	off	each	other	,	you	make	 some 	 thing 	 	,	they	make	 some 	 thing 	 	.	and	i	think	for	me	,	it	's	a	way	of	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	the	city	and	what	might	happen	in	the	city	.	rsw	:	is	it	going	to	be	near	the	current	campus	?
or	is	it	going	to	be	down	near	...	fg	:	no	,	it	's	near	the	current	campus	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	he	's	that	kind	of	patron	.
it	's	not	his	money	,	of	course	.	rsw	:	what	's	his	schedule	on	that	?
fg	:	i	do	n't	know	.
what	's	the	schedule	,	richard	?
richard	koshalek	:	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	 start 	 s 	 	from	2004	.	fg	:	2004	.
you	can	come	to	the	 open 	 ing 	 	.	i	'll	 invit 	 e 	 	you	.
no	,	but	the	issue	of	city	building	in	 demo 	 cracy 	 	is	 interest 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 create 	 s 	 	 cha 	 os 	 	,	right	?
 every 	 body 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	thing	 make 	 s 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	chaotic	environment	,	and	if	you	can	figure	out	how	to	work	off	each	other	--	if	you	can	get	a	bunch	of	people	who	respect	each	other	's	work	and	play	off	each	other	,	you	might	be	able	to	create	 model 	 s 	 	for	how	to	build	 section 	 s 	 	of	the	city	 with 	 out 	 	 resort 	 ing 	 	to	the	one	architect	.	like	the	rockefeller	center	model	,	which	is	kind	of	from	 an 	 other 	 	era	.
rsw	:	i	found	the	most	 remark 	 able 	 	thing	.
my	 pre 	 conception 	 	of	bilbao	was	 th 	 is 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	building	,	you	go	 in 	 side 	 	and	there	'd	be	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 space 	 s 	 	.
i	'd	 s 	 een 	 	 draw 	 ing 	 s 	 	you	had	 present 	 ed 	 	here	at	ted	.
the	surprise	of	bilbao	was	in	 it 	 s 	 	 con 	 text 	 	to	the	city	.
that	was	the	surprise	of	going	 a 	 cross 	 	the	river	,	of	going	on	the	 high 	 way 	 	around	it	,	of	 walk 	 ing 	 	down	the	street	and	 find 	 ing 	 	it	.
that	was	the	real	surprise	of	bilbao	.
fg	:	but	you	know	,	richard	,	most	 architect 	 s 	 	when	they	present	 the 	 ir 	 	work	--	most	of	the	people	we	know	,	you	get	up	and	you	talk	about	your	work	,	and	it	's	 al 	 most 	 	like	you	tell	 every 	 body 	 	you	're	a	good	guy	by	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	look	,	i	'm	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	the	 con 	 text 	 	,	i	'm	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	the	city	,	i	'm	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	my	client	,	i	worry	about	budget	,	that	i	'm	on	time	.	``
 bl 	 ah 	 	,	 bl 	 ah 	 	,	 bl 	 ah 	 	and	all	that	stuff	.
and	it	's	like	 clean 	 s 	 ing 	 	 your 	 self 	 	so	that	you	can	...	by	 say 	 ing 	 	all	that	,	it	 mean 	 s 	 	your	work	is	good	 some 	 how 	 	.
and	i	think	 every 	 body 	 	--	i	mean	that	should	be	a	matter	of	fact	,	like	 gravit 	 y 	 	.
you	're	not	going	to	defy	 gravit 	 y 	 	.
you	've	got	to	work	with	the	building	 depart 	 ment 	 	.	if	you	do	n't	meet	the	 budget 	 s 	 	,	you	're	not	going	to	get	much	work	.

bilbao	,	i	think	,	 show 	 s 	 	that	you	can	have	that	kind	of	personal	 express 	 ion 	 	and	still	touch	all	the	 base 	 s 	 	that	are	 necess 	 ary 	 	of	fitting	 in 	 to 	 	the	city	.
that	's	what	 re 	 minded 	 	me	of	it	.
and	i	think	that	's	the	issue	,	you	know	;
it	's	the	``	then	what	``	that	most	 client 	 s 	 	who	hire	 architect 	 s 	 	--	most	 client 	 s 	 	are	n't	 hir 	 ing 	 	 architect 	 s 	 	for	that	.
they	're	 hir 	 ing 	 	them	to	get	it	 d 	 one 	 	,	get	it	on	budget	,
be	polite	,
and	they	're	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	out	on	the	real	value	of	an	architect	.
rsw	:	at	a	certain	point	a	number	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	people	--	when	michael	 grave 	 s 	 	was	a	fashion	,	before	 teapot 	 s 	 	...	fg	:	i	did	a	teapot	and	 no 	 body 	 	 b 	 ought 	 	it	.
rsw	:	did	it	leak	?
fg	:	no	.
rsw	:	...	people	 want 	 ed 	 	a	michael	 grave 	 s 	 	building	.
is	that	a	curse	,	that	people	want	a	bilbao	building	?
fg	:	 yea 	 h 	 	.
since	bilbao	 open 	 ed 	 	,	which	is	now	four	,	five	 year 	 s 	 	,	both	krens	and	i	have	 be 	 en 	 	 call 	 ed 	 
with	at	 l 	 east 	 	100	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	--
 chin 	 a 	 	,	brazil	,	other	 part 	 s 	 	of	spain	--
to	come	in	and	do	the	bilbao	effect	.
and	i	've	met	with	some	of	these	people	.
 usual 	 ly 	 	i	say	no	right	away	,	but	some	of	them	come	with	 ped 	 igree 	 	and	they	sound	well	-	intentioned
and	they	get	you	for	at	 l 	 east 	 	one	or	two	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
in	one	case	,	i	flew	all	the	way	to	malaga	with	a	team	 be 	 cause 	 	the	thing	was	 sign 	 ed 	 	with	 seal 	 s 	 	and	 vari 	 ous 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	official	 seal 	 s 	 	from	the	city	,
and	that	they	 want 	 ed 	 	me	to	come	and	do	a	building	in	 the 	 ir 	 	port	.	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	what	kind	of	building	it	was	.
``	when	you	get	here	we	'll	explain	it	.	``	 bl 	 ah 	 	,	 bl 	 ah 	 	,	 bl 	 ah 	 	.
so	four	of	us	went	.
and	they	took	us	--	they	put	us	up	in	a	great	hotel	and	we	 we 	 re 	 	looking	over	the	 ba 	 y 	 	,
and	then	they	took	us	in	a	boat	out	in	the	water	and	 show 	 ed 	 	us	all	these	 sight 	 s 	 	in	the	harbor	.
each	one	was	more	 beaut 	 iful 	 	than	the	other	.
and	then	we	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	have	lunch	with	the	mayor	and	we	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	have	 d 	 inner 	 	with	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	people	in	malaga	.
just	before	going	to	lunch	with	the	mayor	,	we	went	to	the	harbor	 commission 	 er 	 	.
it	was	a	table	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	carpet	and	the	harbor	 commission 	 er 	 	was	here	,	and	i	was	here	,	and	my	 guy 	 s 	 	.
we	 s 	 at 	 	down	,	and	we	had	a	drink	of	water	and	 every 	 body 	 	was	quiet	.
and	the	guy	 look 	 ed 	 	at	me	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	now	what	can	i	do	for	you	,	mr.	gehry	?	``
rsw	:	oh	,	my	god	.
fg	:	so	,	i	got	up	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	to	my	team	,	``	let	's	get	out	of	here	.	``	we	stood	up	,	we	 walk 	 ed 	 	out	.
they	 follow 	 ed 	 	--	the	guy	that	 drag 	 ged 	 	us	there	 follow 	 ed 	 	us	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	mean	you	're	not	going	to	have	lunch	with	the	mayor	?	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	nope	.	``	``	you	're	not	going	to	have	 d 	 inner 	 	at	all	?	``	they	just	 br 	 ought 	 	us	there	to	hustle	 th 	 is 	 	group	,	you	know	,	to	create	a	project	.
and	we	get	a	lot	of	that	.
 luck 	 ily 	 	,	i	'm	old	 en 	 ough 	 	that	i	can	complain	i	ca	n't	travel	.
i	do	n't	have	my	own	plane	yet	.
rsw	:	well	,	i	'm	going	to	wind	 th 	 is 	 	up	and	wind	up	the	 meet 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	long	.
but	let	me	just	say	a	couple	 word 	 s 	 	.
fg	:	can	i	say	 some 	 thing 	 	?
are	you	going	to	talk	about	me	or	you	?
rsw	:	once	a	shit	,	 al 	 ways 	 	a	shit	!
fg	:	 be 	 cause 	 	i	want	to	get	a	 stand 	 ing 	 	 ov 	 ation 	 	like	 every 	 body 	 	,	so	...	rsw	:	you	're	going	to	get	one	!	you	're	going	to	get	one	!
i	'm	going	to	make	it	for	you	!
fg	:	no	,	no	.	wait	a	minute	!
