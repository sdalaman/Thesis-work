 cartoon 	 s 	 	are	 bas 	 ically 	 	short	 st 	 ories 	 	.
i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	find	one	that	did	n't	have	a	whole	lot	of	 word 	 s 	 	.
not	all	of	them	have	happy	 end 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
so	how	did	i	get	 start 	 ed 	 	 cartoon 	 ing 	 	?
i	 doodl 	 ed 	 	a	lot	 a 	 s 	 	a	kid	,	and	if	you	 s 	 pend 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	time	 doodl 	 ing 	 	,	 soon 	 er 	 	or	 lat 	 er 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	:	all	your	 care 	 er 	 	 option 	 s 	 	run	out	.
so	you	have	to	make	a	living	 cartoon 	 ing 	 	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	fell	in	love	with	the	ocean	when	i	was	a	little	boy	,	when	i	was	about	eight	or	nine	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	some	of	my	early	work	.
 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	my	mom	took	the	red	 cray 	 on 	 	away	,	so	it	was	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	.
but	i	'd	like	to	 re 	 lay 	 	to	you	a	 child 	 hood 	 	experience	of	mine	that	 re 	 ally 	 	made	me	see	the	ocean	 different 	 ly 	 	,	and	it	's	 be 	 come 	 	the	 found 	 ation 	 	of	my	work	 be 	 cause 	 	,	i	feel	like	,	if	in	a	day	,	i	can	see	the	ocean	 different 	 ly 	 	,	then	i	can	evoke	that	same	kind	of	change	in	 other 	 s 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	.
before	that	day	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	i	saw	the	ocean	.
it	's	just	a	big	blue	surface	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	the	ocean	since	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	time	.
it	's	a	 myster 	 y 	 	.
there	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	lot	of	 folk 	 lore 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	around	the	ocean	,	 most 	 ly 	 	negative	.
and	that	 prompt 	 ed 	 	people	to	make	 map 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	with	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 wonder 	 ful 	 	detail	on	the	land	,	but	when	you	get	to	the	 water 	 s 	 	edge	,	the	ocean	 look 	 s 	 	like	one	giant	 pudd 	 le 	 	of	blue	paint	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	way	i	saw	the	ocean	at	school	--	 a 	 s 	 	if	to	say	,	``	all	 geo 	 graphy 	 	and	science	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	stop	at	water	's	edge	.
 th 	 is 	 	part	's	not	going	to	be	on	the	test	.	``	but	that	day	i	flew	low	over	the	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	--	it	was	a	family	trip	to	the	caribbean	,	and	i	flew	in	a	small	plane	low	over	the	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	saw	.	i	saw	 hill 	 s 	 	and	 val 	 ley 	 s 	 	.
i	saw	 forest 	 s 	 	and	 meadow 	 s 	 	.
i	saw	 grot 	 to 	 es 	 	and	secret	 garden 	 s 	 	and	 place 	 s 	 	i	'd	love	to	hide	 a 	 s 	 	a	kid	,	if	i	could	 on 	 ly 	 	breathe	 under 	 water 	 	.
and	best	of	all	,	i	saw	the	 animal 	 s 	 	.
i	saw	a	 man 	 ta 	 	ray	that	 look 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	big	 a 	 s 	 	the	plane	i	was	 fly 	 ing 	 	in	.
and	i	flew	over	a	 lag 	 oon 	 	with	a	 s 	 hark 	 	in	it	,	and	that	was	the	day	that	my	 com 	 ic 	 	strip	about	a	 s 	 hark 	 	was	born	.
so	from	that	day	on	,	i	was	an	 ordin 	 ary 	 	kid	 walk 	 ing 	 	around	on	dry	land	,	but	my	head	was	down	there	,	 under 	 water 	 	.
up	 un 	 til 	 	that	day	,	these	 we 	 re 	 	the	 animal 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	most	common	in	my	life	.
these	 we 	 re 	 	the	 one 	 s 	 	i	'd	like	to	draw	--	all	 vari 	 ations 	 	of	four	 leg 	 s 	 	and	fur	.
but	when	you	got	to	the	ocean	,	my	 imagin 	 ation 	 	was	no	 com 	 petition 	 	for	nature	.
every	time	i	'd	come	up	with	a	crazy	cartoon	character	on	the	 draw 	 ing 	 	board	,	i	'd	find	a	critter	in	the	ocean	that	was	even	 crazi 	 er 	 	.
and	the	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	in	scale	between	 th 	 is 	 	 tin 	 y 	 	sea	dragon	and	 th 	 is 	 	enormous	 hump 	 back 	 	whale	was	like	 some 	 thing 	 	out	of	a	science	-	fiction	movie	.
 when 	 ever 	 	i	talk	to	 kid 	 s 	 	,	i	 al 	 ways 	 	like	to	tell	them	,	the	 big 	 gest 	 	animal	that	ever	lived	is	still	 al 	 ive 	 	.
it	's	not	a	dinosaur	;	it	's	a	whale	,	 animal 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	big	 a 	 s 	 	 off 	 ice 	 	 building 	 s 	 	still	 swimm 	 ing 	 	around	out	there	in	our	ocean	.
 s 	 peaking 	 	of	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	are	 bas 	 ically 	 	the	same	fish	they	 we 	 re 	 	300	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
so	if	you	ever	 fanta 	 s 	 ize 	 	about	going	back	in	time	and	 see 	 ing 	 	what	a	dinosaur	 look 	 ed 	 	like	,	that	's	what	a	dinosaur	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
so	you	have	living	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	and	space	 alien 	 s 	 	,	 animal 	 s 	 	that	 evolv 	 ed 	 	in	zero	 gravit 	 y 	 	in	harsh	 condition 	 s 	 	.
it	's	just	 in 	 credible 	 	;	no	hollywood	 design 	 er 	 	could	come	up	with	 some 	 thing 	 	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	than	that	.
or	 th 	 is 	 	 fang 	 tooth 	 	.	the	 particle 	 s 	 	in	the	water	make	it	look	like	it	's	 float 	 ing 	 	in	 out 	 er 	 	space	.
could	you	image	if	we	 look 	 ed 	 	through	the	hubble	 tele 	 scope 	 	and	we	saw	that	?
it	would	start	a	whole	new	space	race	.
but	 in 	 stead 	 	,	we	stick	a	camera	in	the	deep	ocean	,	and	we	see	a	fish	,	and	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	capture	our	 imagin 	 ation 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
we	say	to	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	``	 may 	 be 	 	we	can	make	fish	 stick 	 s 	 	with	it	or	 some 	 thing 	 	.	``
so	,	what	i	'd	like	to	do	now	is	try	a	little	 draw 	 ing 	 	.
so	,	i	'm	going	to	try	to	draw	 th 	 is 	 	 fang 	 tooth 	 	here	.
i	love	to	draw	the	deep	sea	fish	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	so	 ug 	 ly 	 	,	but	 beaut 	 iful 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	way	.
 may 	 be 	 	we	can	give	him	a	little	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nce 	 	here	--	give	him	a	 head 	 light 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	a	brake	light	,	turn	 signal 	 s 	 	.
but	it	's	easy	to	see	why	these	 animal 	 s 	 	make	 s 	 uch 	 	great	cartoon	 character 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 shape 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 ize 	 s 	 	.
so	some	of	them	 actual 	 ly 	 	seem	to	have	 power 	 s 	 	like	 super 	 heroes 	 	in	a	 com 	 ic 	 	book	.
for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	take	these	sea	 turtle 	 s 	 	.
they	kind	of	have	a	sixth	sense	like	 super 	 man 	 	's	x	-	ray	vision	.
they	can	sense	the	 magnet 	 ic 	 	 field 	 s 	 	of	the	earth	.
and	they	can	use	that	sense	to	 navig 	 ate 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 mile 	 s 	 	of	open	ocean	.
i	kind	of	give	my	turtle	 hand 	 s 	 	just	to	make	them	an	 eas 	 ier 	 	cartoon	character	to	work	with	.
or	take	 th 	 is 	 	sea	cucumber	.
it	's	not	an	animal	we	draw	 cartoon 	 s 	 	of	or	draw	at	all	.
he	's	like	an	 under 	 water 	 	spiderman	.
he	 shoot 	 s 	 	out	these	 stick 	 y 	 	 web 	 s 	 	to	entangle	his	 ene 	 my 	 	.
of	course	,	sea	 cucumber 	 s 	 	shoot	them	out	 the 	 ir 	 	 rear 	 s 	 	,	which	,	in	my	opinion	,	 make 	 s 	 	them	much	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	a	 super 	 hero 	 	.
he	ca	n't	spin	a	web	 any 	 time 	 	;	he	's	got	to	pull	his	pants	down	first	.
or	the	 blow 	 fish 	 	.
the	 blow 	 fish 	 	is	like	the	 in 	 credible 	 	hulk	.
it	can	change	 it 	 s 	 	body	 in 	 to 	 	a	big	,	 intimid 	 ating 	 	fish	in	a	matter	of	 second 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	draw	 th 	 is 	 	 blow 	 fish 	 	 un 	 inflated 	 	.
and	then	i	'm	going	to	attempt	 on 	 screen 	 	 anim 	 ation 	 	here	.
let	's	see	.
try	and	 infla 	 te 	 	it	.
``	you	 talk 	 in 	 	'	to	me	?	``	see	,	he	can	 infla 	 te 	 	 him 	 self 	 	when	he	 want 	 s 	 	to	be	 intimid 	 ating 	 	.
or	take	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 word 	 fish 	 	.
could	you	imagine	 be 	 ing 	 	born	with	a	tool	for	a	nose	?
do	you	think	he	 wake 	 s 	 	up	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	 look 	 s 	 	in	the	mirror	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 some 	 body 	 	's	 get 	 ting 	 	 stab 	 bed 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.	``
or	 th 	 is 	 	 lion 	 fish 	 	for	 in 	 stance 	 	.
imagine	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	 friend 	 s 	 	 cover 	 ed 	 	with	razor	-	sharp	 poison 	 ous 	 	 barb 	 s 	 	.
it	's	not	 some 	 thing 	 	you	want	to	put	on	your	facebook	page	,	right	?
my	 character 	 s 	 	are	--	my	lead	character	's	a	 s 	 hark 	 	named	sherman	.
he	's	a	great	white	 s 	 hark 	 	.
and	i	kind	of	broke	the	mold	with	sherman	.
i	did	n't	want	to	go	with	 th 	 is 	 	 ruth 	 less 	 	predator	image	.
he	's	kind	of	just	out	there	making	a	living	.
he	's	sort	of	a	homer	simpson	with	 fin 	 s 	 	.
and	then	his	 side 	 kick 	 	is	a	sea	turtle	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	before	,	named	filmore	.
he	uses	his	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	at	 navig 	 ation 	 	to	wander	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	,	looking	for	a	mate	.
and	he	 do 	 es 	 	manage	to	find	them	,	but	great	 navig 	 ation 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	,	 lous 	 y 	 	pick	-	up	lines	.
he	never	 seem 	 s 	 	to	settle	on	any	 part 	 icular 	 	girl	.
i	have	a	hermit	crab	named	hawthorne	,	who	 do 	 es 	 	n't	get	a	lot	of	respect	 a 	 s 	 	a	hermit	crab	,	so	he	kind	of	 wish 	 es 	 	he	 we 	 re 	 	a	great	white	 s 	 hark 	 	.
and	then	i	'll	 introduc 	 e 	 	you	to	one	more	character	,	 th 	 is 	 	guy	,	ernest	,	who	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	a	juvenile	delinquent	in	a	fish	body	.
so	with	 character 	 s 	 	,	you	can	make	 st 	 ories 	 	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	making	a	story	is	 a 	 s 	 	easy	 a 	 s 	 	 put 	 ting 	 	two	 character 	 s 	 	in	a	room	and	 see 	 ing 	 	what	 happen 	 s 	 	.
so	,	imagine	a	great	white	 s 	 hark 	 	and	a	giant	 s 	 quid 	 	in	the	same	 bath 	 room 	 	.
or	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	i	take	them	to	 place 	 s 	 	that	people	have	never	heard	of	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 under 	 water 	 	.
for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	i	took	them	 ski 	 ing 	 	in	the	mid	-	atlantic	range	,	which	is	 th 	 is 	 	range	of	 mountain 	 s 	 	in	the	middle	of	the	atlantic	.
i	've	taken	them	to	the	sea	of	japan	,	where	they	met	giant	 jelly 	 fish 	 	.
i	've	taken	them	 camp 	 ing 	 	in	the	kelp	 forest 	 s 	 	of	california	.
 th 	 is 	 	next	one	here	,	i	did	a	story	on	the	census	of	marine	life	.
and	that	was	a	lot	of	 f 	 un 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	most	of	you	know	,	it	's	a	real	project	we	've	heard	about	.
but	it	was	a	chance	for	me	to	 introduc 	 e 	 	 read 	 ers 	 	to	a	lot	of	crazy	 under 	 sea 	 	 character 	 s 	 	.
so	we	start	off	the	story	with	ernest	,	who	 volunteer 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	census	taker	.
he	 go 	 es 	 	down	and	he	 meet 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	famous	 angle 	 r 	 fish 	 	.
then	he	 meet 	 s 	 	the	yeti	crab	,	the	famous	vampire	 s 	 quid 	 	--	elusive	,	hard	to	find	--	and	the	dumbo	 oct 	 opus 	 	,	which	 look 	 s 	 	so	much	like	a	cartoon	in	real	life	that	 re 	 ally 	 	did	n't	have	to	change	a	thing	when	i	drew	it	.
i	did	 an 	 other 	 	story	on	marine	 deb 	 ris 	 	.
i	was	 s 	 peaking 	 	to	a	lot	of	my	 friend 	 s 	 	in	the	 conserv 	 ation 	 	business	,	and	they	--	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	,	``	so	what	's	one	issue	you	would	like	 every 	 one 	 	to	know	more	about	?	``
and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	one	friend	of	mine	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	've	got	one	word	for	you	:	plastic	.	``
and	i	told	him	,	``	well	,	i	need	 some 	 thing 	 	a	little	 s 	 ex 	 ier 	 	than	that	.
plastic	just	is	not	going	to	do	it	.	``
we	sort	of	 work 	 ed 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	out	.
he	 want 	 ed 	 	me	to	use	 word 	 s 	 	like	 poly 	 vinyl 	 	chloride	,	which	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	work	in	voice	 balloon 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.
i	could	n't	fit	them	in	.
so	what	i	did	was	i	made	an	adventure	strip	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	bottle	 travel 	 s 	 	a	long	way	.
what	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	tell	 read 	 ers 	 	is	that	plastic	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	go	away	;	it	just	 continu 	 es 	 	to	wash	 down 	 stream 	 	.	and	a	lot	of	it	 end 	 s 	 	up	 wash 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	ocean	,	which	is	a	great	story	if	you	attach	a	couple	 character 	 s 	 	to	it	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	if	they	ca	n't	stand	each	other	,	like	these	two	.
so	,	i	 s 	 ent 	 	them	to	boise	,	idaho	,	where	they	 drop 	 ped 	 	a	plastic	bottle	 in 	 to 	 	the	boise	 sew 	 er 	 	system	.
and	it	 end 	 ed 	 	up	in	the	boise	river	and	then	on	to	the	columbia	river	and	then	to	the	mouth	of	the	columbia	and	to	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	ocean	and	then	on	to	 th 	 is 	 	place	 call 	 ed 	 	the	great	 pac 	 ific 	 	garbage	patch	--	which	is	 th 	 is 	 	giant	 pac 	 ific 	 	 gy 	 re 	 	in	the	north	 pac 	 ific 	 	,	where	a	lot	of	 th 	 is 	 	plastic	 end 	 s 	 	up	 float 	 ing 	 	around	--	and	then	back	onto	the	 lag 	 oon 	 	.
so	that	was	 bas 	 ically 	 	a	 bud 	 dy 	 	story	with	a	plastic	bottle	 follow 	 ing 	 	 a 	 long 	 	.
so	a	lot	of	people	remember	the	plastic	bottle	 any 	 way 	 	,	but	we	 re 	 ally 	 	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	marine	 deb 	 ris 	 	and	plastic	in	the	course	of	that	one	.
the	third	 story 	 line 	 	i	did	about	a	year	and	a	half	ago	was	 prob 	 ably 	 	my	most	difficult	.
it	was	on	 s 	 hark 	 	 fin 	 ning 	 	,	and	i	felt	 re 	 ally 	 	 strong 	 ly 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	issue	.	and	i	felt	like	,	since	my	main	character	was	a	 s 	 hark 	 	,	the	 com 	 ic 	 	strip	was	a	perfect	vehicle	for	 tell 	 ing 	 	the	public	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
now	,	 fin 	 ning 	 	is	the	act	of	taking	a	 s 	 hark 	 	,	cutting	the	 valu 	 able 	 	 fin 	 s 	 	off	and	 throw 	 ing 	 	the	live	animal	back	in	the	water	.
it	's	cruel	,	it	's	 waste 	 ful 	 	.
there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	funny	or	 entertain 	 ing 	 	about	it	,	but	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	take	 th 	 is 	 	issue	on	.
i	had	to	kill	my	main	character	,	who	is	a	 s 	 hark 	 	.
we	start	with	sherman	in	a	chinese	restaurant	,	who	 get 	 s 	 	a	fortune	that	he	's	about	to	get	caught	by	a	 trawl 	 er 	 	,	which	he	 do 	 es 	 	.
and	then	he	dies	.
he	 get 	 s 	 	 fin 	 ned 	 	,	and	then	he	 get 	 s 	 	 throw 	 n 	 	 over 	 board 	 	.
 o 	 sten 	 s 	 ibly 	 	,	he	's	dead	now	.
and	so	i	 kill 	 ed 	 	a	character	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	in	the	 news 	 paper 	 	for	15	 year 	 s 	 	.
so	i	got	a	lot	of	 read 	 er 	 	 feed 	 back 	 	on	that	one	.
 mean 	 while 	 	,	the	other	 character 	 s 	 	are	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 s 	 hark 	 	fin	soup	.
i	do	three	or	four	 strip 	 s 	 	after	that	where	we	explore	the	 fin 	 ning 	 	issue	and	the	 s 	 hark 	 	fin	soup	issue	.
sherman	's	up	in	 s 	 hark 	 	heaven	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	love	about	 com 	 ic 	 	 strip 	 s 	 	,	you	know	.
you	 re 	 ally 	 	do	n't	have	to	worry	about	the	audience	 suspend 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	sense	of	 dis 	 belief 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	,	if	you	start	with	a	 talk 	 ing 	 	 s 	 hark 	 	,	 read 	 ers 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	check	 the 	 ir 	 	 dis 	 belief 	 	at	the	door	.
you	can	kind	of	do	 any 	 thing 	 	.
it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	near	-	death	experience	for	sherman	.
 mean 	 while 	 	,	ernest	 find 	 s 	 	his	 fin 	 s 	 	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
there	was	a	real	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	based	in	 chin 	 a 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 old 	 	 s 	 hark 	 	 fin 	 s 	 	,	so	i	kind	of	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	that	.
and	he	 click 	 s 	 	the	``	buy	now	``	button	.
and	 vo 	 ila 	 	,	next	-	day	air	,	they	show	up	,	and	they	 sur 	 gical 	 ly 	 	 re 	 attach 	 	them	.
i	 end 	 ed 	 	that	 s 	 eries 	 	with	a	kind	of	a	mail	-	in	petition	that	 encourag 	 ed 	 	our	national	marine	 fish 	 ery 	 	service	,	to	force	other	 count 	 ries 	 	to	have	a	 strong 	 er 	 	stance	with	 s 	 hark 	 	management	.
 thank 	 s 	 	.
i	'd	like	to	end	with	a	little	metaphor	here	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	think	of	a	metaphor	to	represent	mission	blue	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	came	up	with	.
imagine	you	're	in	an	enormous	room	,	and	it	's	 a 	 s 	 	dark	 a 	 s 	 	a	cave	.
and	you	can	have	 any 	 thing 	 	in	that	room	,	 any 	 thing 	 	you	want	,	but	you	ca	n't	see	 any 	 thing 	 	.
you	've	 be 	 en 	 	 give 	 n 	 	one	tool	,	a	hammer	.
so	you	wander	around	in	the	 dark 	 ness 	 	,	and	you	bump	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	,	and	it	 feel 	 s 	 	like	it	's	made	of	stone	.
it	's	big	,	it	's	heavy	.	you	ca	n't	carry	it	away	,	so	you	bang	it	with	your	hammer	,	and	you	break	off	a	piece	.
and	you	take	the	piece	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	 day 	 light 	 	.
and	you	see	you	have	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	piece	of	white	 ala 	 ba 	 ster 	 	.
so	you	say	to	 your 	 self 	 	,	``	well	,	that	's	worth	 some 	 thing 	 	.	``
so	you	go	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	room	,	and	you	break	 th 	 is 	 	thing	to	 piece 	 s 	 	,	and	you	haul	it	away	.
and	you	find	other	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	you	break	that	up	,	and	you	haul	 t 	 hose 	 	away	.
and	you	're	 get 	 ting 	 	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	cool	stuff	.
and	you	hear	other	people	 do 	 ing 	 	the	same	thing	.
so	you	get	 th 	 is 	 	sense	of	 urge 	 ncy 	 	,	like	you	need	to	find	 a 	 s 	 	much	stuff	 a 	 s 	 	possible	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	possible	.
and	then	some	 yell 	 s 	 	,	``	stop	!	``
and	they	turn	up	the	 light 	 s 	 	.
and	you	 real 	 ize 	 	where	you	are	;	you	're	in	the	louvre	.
and	you	've	taken	all	 th 	 is 	 	 complex 	 ity 	 	and	 beaut 	 y 	 	,	and	you	've	 turn 	 ed 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	cheap	 commodit 	 y 	 	.
and	that	's	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	with	the	ocean	.
and	part	of	what	mission	blue	is	about	is	 yell 	 ing 	 	,	``	stop	!	``
so	that	each	of	us	--	 explore 	 r 	 	,	scientist	,	 cartoon 	 ist 	 	,	 s 	 ing 	 er 	 	,	chef	--	can	turn	up	the	 light 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	way	.
and	that	's	what	i	hope	my	 com 	 ic 	 	strip	 do 	 es 	 	in	a	small	way	.
that	's	why	i	like	what	i	do	.
