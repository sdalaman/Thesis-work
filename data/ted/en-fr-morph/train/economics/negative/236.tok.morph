hi	.	i	'm	going	to	ask	you	to	raise	your	 arm 	 s 	 	and	wave	back	,	just	the	way	i	am	--	kind	of	a	royal	wave	.
you	can	mimic	what	you	can	see	.
you	can	program	the	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 muscle 	 s 	 	in	your	arm	.
soon	,	you	'll	be	able	to	look	 in 	 side 	 	your	brain	and	program	,	control	the	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	brain	 area 	 s 	 	that	you	see	there	.
i	'm	going	to	tell	you	about	that	technology	.
people	have	 want 	 ed 	 	to	look	 in 	 side 	 	the	human	mind	,	the	human	brain	,	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
well	,	coming	out	of	the	research	 lab 	 s 	 	just	now	,	for	our	generation	,	is	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	to	do	that	.
people	envision	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	.
you	had	to	take	a	 space 	 ship 	 	,	shrink	it	down	,	inject	it	 in 	 to 	 	the	 blood 	 stream 	 	.
it	was	 terr 	 ibly 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
you	could	be	 attack 	 ed 	 	by	white	blood	 cell 	 s 	 	in	the	 arteri 	 es 	 	.
but	now	,	we	have	a	real	technology	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
we	're	going	to	fly	 in 	 to 	 	my	 col 	 league 	 	peter	's	brain	.
we	're	going	to	do	it	non	-	 invasive 	 ly 	 	using	mri	.
we	do	n't	have	to	inject	 any 	 thing 	 	.	we	do	n't	need	 radi 	 ation 	 	.
we	will	be	able	to	fly	 in 	 to 	 	the	anatomy	of	peter	's	brain	--	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	fly	 in 	 to 	 	his	body	--	but	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	we	can	look	 in 	 to 	 	his	mind	.
when	peter	 move 	 s 	 	his	arm	,	that	yellow	spot	you	see	there	is	the	 inter 	 face 	 	to	the	 function 	 ing 	 	of	peter	's	mind	taking	place	.
now	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	before	that	with	 electro 	 de 	 s 	 	you	can	control	robotic	 arm 	 s 	 	,	that	brain	 im 	 aging 	 	and	 scanner 	 s 	 	can	show	you	the	 insid 	 es 	 	of	 brain 	 s 	 	.
what	's	new	is	that	that	process	 ha 	 s 	 	 typical 	 ly 	 	taken	 day 	 s 	 	or	 month 	 s 	 	of	analysis	.
we	've	 collapse 	 d 	 	that	through	technology	to	 milli 	 second 	 s 	 	,
and	that	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	let	peter	to	look	at	his	brain	in	real	time	 a 	 s 	 	he	's	 in 	 side 	 	the	scanner	.
he	can	look	at	these	65,000	 point 	 s 	 	of	 activ 	 ation 	 	per	second	.
if	he	can	see	 th 	 is 	 	pattern	in	his	own	brain	,	he	can	learn	how	to	control	it	.
there	have	 be 	 en 	 	three	ways	to	try	to	impact	the	brain	:	the	therapist	's	couch	,	 pill 	 s 	 	and	the	knife	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	fourth	 alter 	 native 	 	that	you	are	soon	going	to	have	.
we	all	know	that	 a 	 s 	 	we	form	 thought 	 s 	 	,	they	form	deep	 channel 	 s 	 	in	our	 mind 	 s 	 	and	in	our	 brain 	 s 	 	.
chronic	pain	is	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	.	if	you	burn	 your 	 self 	 	,	you	pull	your	hand	away	.
but	if	you	're	still	in	pain	in	six	 month 	 s 	 	'	or	six	 year 	 s 	 	'	time	,	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	these	 circuit 	 s 	 	are	producing	pain	that	's	no	 long 	 er 	 	 help 	 ing 	 	you	.
if	we	can	look	at	the	 activ 	 ation 	 	in	the	brain	that	's	producing	the	pain	,	we	can	form	3d	 model 	 s 	 	and	watch	in	real	time	the	brain	process	information	,	and	then	we	can	select	the	 area 	 s 	 	that	produce	the	pain	.
so	put	your	 arm 	 s 	 	back	up	and	flex	your	bicep	.
now	imagine	that	you	will	soon	be	able	to	look	 in 	 side 	 	your	brain	and	select	brain	 area 	 s 	 	to	do	that	same	thing	.
what	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	here	is	,	we	've	 select 	 ed 	 	the	 path 	 ways 	 	in	the	brain	of	a	chronic	pain	patient	.
 th 	 is 	 	may	shock	you	,	but	we	're	 liter 	 ally 	 	 read 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	person	's	brain	in	real	time	.
they	're	 watch 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	brain	 activ 	 ation 	 	,	and	they	're	 controll 	 ing 	 	the	 path 	 way 	 	that	 produce 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	pain	.
they	're	 learn 	 ing 	 	to	flex	 th 	 is 	 	system	that	 re 	 lease 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 endo 	 genous 	 	 opi 	 ates 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	they	do	it	,	in	the	upper	left	is	a	 dis 	 play 	 	that	's	 yo 	 ked 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	brain	 activ 	 ation 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	pain	 be 	 ing 	 	controlled	.
when	they	control	 the 	 ir 	 	brain	,	they	can	control	 the 	 ir 	 	pain	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 investigation 	 al 	 	technology	,
but	,	in	 clinic 	 al 	 	 trial 	 s 	 	,	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	a	44	to	64	percent	 de 	 crease 	 	in	chronic	pain	 patient 	 s 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	``	the	 m 	 atrix 	 	.	``	you	can	 on 	 ly 	 	do	 th 	 is 	 	to	 your 	 self 	 	.	you	take	control	.
i	've	 s 	 een 	 	 in 	 side 	 	my	brain	.	you	will	too	,	soon	.
when	you	do	,	what	do	you	want	to	control	?
you	will	be	able	to	look	at	all	the	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	that	make	you	 your 	 self 	 	,	all	your	 experience 	 s 	 	.	these	are	some	of	the	 area 	 s 	 	we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 to 	 day 	 	that	i	do	n't	have	time	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	in	detail	.
but	i	want	to	 leav 	 e 	 	with	you	the	big	question	.
we	are	the	first	generation	that	's	going	to	be	able	to	enter	 in 	 to 	 	,	using	 th 	 is 	 	technology	,	the	human	mind	and	brain	.
where	will	we	take	it	?
