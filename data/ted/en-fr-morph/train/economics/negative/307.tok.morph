i	and	my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	art	aron	and	lucy	 brow 	 n 	 	and	 other 	 s 	 	,	have	put	37	people	who	are	 mad 	 ly 	 	in	love	 in 	 to 	 	a	functional	mri	brain	scanner	.
17	who	 we 	 re 	 	 hap 	 pi 	 ly 	 	in	love	,	15	who	had	just	 be 	 en 	 	 dump 	 ed 	 	,	and	we	're	just	 start 	 ing 	 	our	third	experiment	:	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	people	who	report	that	they	're	still	in	love	after	10	to	25	 year 	 s 	 	of	marriage	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	short	story	of	that	research	.
in	the	 jungle 	 s 	 	of	guatemala	,	in	tikal	,	 stand 	 s 	 	a	temple	.
it	was	built	by	the	 grand 	 est 	 	 s 	 un 	 	king	,	of	the	 grand 	 est 	 	city	-	state	,	of	the	 grand 	 est 	 	 civil 	 ization 	 	of	the	americas	,	the	mayas	.
his	name	was	jasaw	chan	k'awiil	.
he	stood	over	six	feet	tall	.
he	lived	 in 	 to 	 	his	80s	,	and	he	was	buried	 be 	 neath 	 	 th 	 is 	 	monument	in	720	ad	.
and	mayan	 in 	 script 	 ions 	 	 pro 	 claim 	 	that	he	was	 deep 	 ly 	 	in	love	with	his	wife	.
so	,	he	built	a	temple	in	her	honor	,	facing	his	.
and	every	spring	and	 aut 	 umn 	 	,	 exact 	 ly 	 	at	the	 equi 	 nox 	 	,	the	 s 	 un 	 	 rise 	 s 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	his	temple	,	and	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 bath 	 es 	 	her	temple	with	his	shadow	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	the	 s 	 un 	 	 set 	 s 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	her	temple	in	the	afternoon	,	it	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 bath 	 es 	 	his	temple	with	her	shadow	.
after	1,300	 year 	 s 	 	,	these	two	 lover 	 s 	 	still	touch	and	kiss	from	 the 	 ir 	 	tomb	.
around	the	world	,	people	love	.
they	 s 	 ing 	 	for	love	,	they	dance	for	love	,	they	compose	 poem 	 s 	 	and	 st 	 ories 	 	about	love	.
they	tell	 myth 	 s 	 	and	 legend 	 s 	 	about	love	.
they	pine	for	love	,	they	live	for	love	,	they	kill	for	love	,	and	they	die	for	love	.
 a 	 s 	 	walt	whitman	once	 s 	 aid 	 	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	oh	,	i	would	 s 	 take 	 	all	for	you	.	``
 anthropo 	 logists 	 	have	found	evidence	of	romantic	love	in	170	 socie 	 ties 	 	.
they	've	never	found	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	that	did	not	have	it	.
but	love	is	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	a	happy	experience	.
in	one	 stud 	 y 	 	of	college	 student 	 s 	 	,	they	 ask 	 ed 	 	a	lot	of	 question 	 s 	 	about	love	,	but	the	two	that	stood	out	to	me	the	most	 we 	 re 	 	,	``	have	you	ever	 be 	 en 	 	 reject 	 ed 	 	by	 some 	 body 	 	who	you	 re 	 ally 	 	 love 	 d 	 	?	``
and	the	second	question	was	,	``	have	you	ever	 dump 	 ed 	 	 some 	 body 	 	who	 re 	 ally 	 	 love 	 d 	 	you	?	``
and	 al 	 most 	 	95	percent	of	both	men	and	women	 s 	 aid 	 	 y 	 es 	 	to	both	.
 al 	 most 	 	 no 	 body 	 	 get 	 s 	 	out	of	love	 al 	 ive 	 	.
so	,	before	i	start	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	about	the	brain	,	i	want	to	read	for	you	what	i	think	is	the	most	 power 	 ful 	 	love	poem	on	earth	.
there	's	other	love	 poem 	 s 	 	that	are	,	of	course	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	good	,	but	i	do	n't	think	 th 	 is 	 	one	can	be	 surpass 	 ed 	 	.
it	was	told	by	an	 anonym 	 ous 	 	kwakiutl	indian	of	southern	alaska	to	a	 mission 	 ary 	 	in	1896	,	and	here	it	is	.
i	've	never	had	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	say	it	before	.
``	fire	 run 	 s 	 	through	my	body	with	the	pain	of	loving	you	.	pain	 run 	 s 	 	through	my	body	with	the	 fire 	 s 	 	of	my	love	for	you	.
pain	like	a	boil	about	to	burst	with	my	love	for	you	,	 consum 	 ed 	 	by	fire	with	my	love	for	you	.	i	remember	what	you	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	.
i	am	 think 	 ing 	 	of	your	love	for	me	.	i	am	torn	by	your	love	for	me	.
pain	and	more	pain	--	where	are	you	going	with	my	love	?
i	am	told	you	will	go	from	here	.
i	am	told	you	will	 leav 	 e 	 	me	here	.
my	body	is	numb	with	grief	.
remember	what	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	my	love	.
 good 	 bye 	 	,	my	love	,	 good 	 bye 	 	.	``
emily	dickinson	once	wrote	,	``	 part 	 ing 	 	is	all	we	need	to	know	of	hell	.	``
how	 man 	 y 	 	people	have	 suffer 	 ed 	 	in	all	the	 million 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	of	human	evolution	?
how	 man 	 y 	 	people	around	the	world	are	 danc 	 ing 	 	with	 el 	 ation 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	minute	?
romantic	love	is	one	of	the	most	 power 	 ful 	 	 sens 	 ations 	 	on	earth	.
so	,	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	look	 in 	 to 	 	the	brain	and	 stud 	 y 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 mad 	 ness 	 	.
our	first	 stud 	 y 	 	of	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	 hap 	 pi 	 ly 	 	in	love	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 wide 	 ly 	 	 public 	 ized 	 	,	so	i	'm	 on 	 ly 	 	going	to	say	a	 ver 	 y 	 	little	about	it	.
we	found	activity	in	a	 tin 	 y 	 	,	little	 factor 	 y 	 	near	the	base	of	the	brain	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 vent 	 ral 	 	 teg 	 mental 	 	area	.
we	found	activity	in	some	 cell 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	a	10	 cell 	 s 	 	,
 cell 	 s 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	make	dopamine	,	a	natural	 stimul 	 ant 	 	,	and	spray	it	to	 man 	 y 	 	brain	 region 	 s 	 	.
 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	part	,	the	vta	,	is	part	of	the	brain	's	reward	system	.
it	's	way	 be 	 low 	 	your	cognitive	 think 	 ing 	 	process	.
it	's	 be 	 low 	 	your	 emotion 	 s 	 	.
it	's	part	of	what	we	call	the	 reptil 	 ian 	 	core	of	the	brain	,	 associate 	 d 	 	with	 want 	 ing 	 	,	with	 motiv 	 ation 	 	,	with	focus	and	with	 crav 	 ing 	 	.
in	fact	,	the	same	brain	region	where	we	found	activity	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	active	 al 	 so 	 	when	you	feel	the	rush	of	 coca 	 ine 	 	.
but	romantic	love	is	much	more	than	a	 coca 	 ine 	 	high	--	at	 l 	 east 	 	you	come	down	from	 coca 	 ine 	 	.
romantic	love	is	an	obsession	.	it	 possess 	 es 	 	you	.
you	lose	your	sense	of	self	.
you	ca	n't	stop	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 an 	 other 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 	.
 some 	 body 	 	is	 camp 	 ing 	 	in	your	head	.
 a 	 s 	 	an	eighth	-	century	japanese	poet	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	my	 long 	 ing 	 	had	no	time	when	it	 cease 	 s 	 	.	``
wild	is	love	.
and	the	obsession	can	get	 wo 	 rse 	 	when	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	 reject 	 ed 	 	.
so	,	right	now	,	lucy	 brow 	 n 	 	and	i	,	the	 neuro 	 scientist 	 	on	our	project	,	are	looking	at	the	data	of	the	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	put	 in 	 to 	 	the	machine	after	they	had	just	 be 	 en 	 	 dump 	 ed 	 	.
it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 put 	 ting 	 	these	people	in	the	machine	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	in	 s 	 uch 	 	bad	shape	.
so	 any 	 way 	 	,	we	found	activity	in	three	brain	 region 	 s 	 	.	we	found	activity	in	the	brain	region	,	in	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	brain	region	 associate 	 d 	 	with	 intens 	 e 	 	romantic	love	.
what	a	bad	deal	.
you	know	,	when	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	 dump 	 ed 	 	,	the	one	thing	you	love	to	do	is	just	forget	about	 th 	 is 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 	,	and	then	go	on	with	your	life	--	but	no	,	you	just	love	them	 hard 	 er 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	the	poet	terence	,	the	roman	poet	once	 s 	 aid 	 	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	the	less	my	hope	,	the	 hot 	 ter 	 	my	love	.	``
and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	we	now	know	why	.
two	thousand	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	we	can	explain	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	brain	.
that	brain	system	--	the	reward	system	for	 want 	 ing 	 	,	for	 motiv 	 ation 	 	,	for	 crav 	 ing 	 	,	for	focus	--	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	more	active	when	you	ca	n't	get	what	you	want	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	life	's	 great 	 est 	 	prize	:	an	appropriate	 mat 	 ing 	 	partner	.
we	found	activity	in	other	brain	 region 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	--	in	a	brain	region	 associate 	 d 	 	with	 calcul 	 ating 	 	 gain 	 s 	 	and	 loss 	 es 	 	.
you	know	,	you	're	 ly 	 ing 	 	there	,	you	're	looking	at	the	picture	,	and	you	're	in	 th 	 is 	 	machine	,	and	you	're	 calcul 	 ating 	 	,	you	know	,	what	went	wrong	.
how	,	you	know	,	what	have	i	lost	?
 a 	 s 	 	a	matter	of	fact	,	lucy	and	i	have	a	little	joke	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	 come 	 s 	 	from	a	david	mamet	play	,	and	there	's	two	con	 artist 	 s 	 	in	the	play	,	and	the	woman	is	 con 	 ning 	 	the	man	,	and	the	man	 look 	 s 	 	at	the	woman	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	oh	,	you	're	a	bad	 p 	 ony 	 	,	i	'm	not	going	to	bet	on	you	.	``
and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	it	's	 th 	 is 	 	part	of	the	brain	,	the	core	of	the	nucleus	 accu 	 mb 	 en 	 s 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	that	is	 be 	 coming 	 	active	 a 	 s 	 	you	're	 measur 	 ing 	 	your	 gain 	 s 	 	and	 loss 	 es 	 	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	the	brain	region	that	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	active	when	you	're	 will 	 ing 	 	to	take	enormous	 risk 	 s 	 	for	huge	 gain 	 s 	 	and	huge	 loss 	 es 	 	.
last	but	not	 l 	 east 	 	,	we	found	activity	in	a	brain	region	 associate 	 d 	 	with	deep	 attach 	 ment 	 	to	 an 	 other 	 	individual	.
no	wonder	people	suffer	around	the	world	,	and	we	have	so	 man 	 y 	 	 crime 	 s 	 	of	 pass 	 ion 	 	.
when	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	 reject 	 ed 	 	in	love	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	are	you	 engulf 	 ed 	 	with	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	romantic	love	,	but	you	're	 feel 	 ing 	 	deep	 attach 	 ment 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	individual	.
 more 	 over 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	brain	circuit	for	reward	is	 work 	 ing 	 	,	and	you	're	 feel 	 ing 	 	 intens 	 e 	 	energy	,	 intens 	 e 	 	focus	,	 intens 	 e 	 	 motiv 	 ation 	 	and	the	 will 	 ing 	 ness 	 	to	risk	it	all	to	win	life	's	 great 	 est 	 	prize	.
so	,	what	have	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	experiment	that	i	would	like	to	tell	the	world	?
 fore 	 most 	 	,	i	have	come	to	think	that	romantic	love	is	a	drive	,	a	 bas 	 ic 	 	 mat 	 ing 	 	drive	.
not	the	 s 	 ex 	 	drive	--	the	 s 	 ex 	 	drive	 get 	 s 	 	you	out	there	,	looking	for	a	whole	range	of	 partner 	 s 	 	.
romantic	love	 en 	 able 	 s 	 	you	to	focus	your	 mat 	 ing 	 	energy	on	just	one	at	a	time	,	 conserv 	 e 	 	your	 mat 	 ing 	 	energy	,	and	start	the	 mat 	 ing 	 	process	with	 th 	 is 	 	single	individual	.
i	think	of	all	the	 poet 	 ry 	 	that	i	've	read	about	romantic	love	,	what	 sum 	 s 	 	it	up	best	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	 s 	 aid 	 	by	plato	,	over	2,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	the	god	of	love	 live 	 s 	 	in	a	state	of	need	.
it	is	a	need	.	it	is	an	urge	.
it	is	a	 home 	 o 	 static 	 	 im 	 balance 	 	.
like	 hung 	 er 	 	and	thirst	,	it	's	 al 	 most 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	to	stamp	out	.	``
i	've	 al 	 so 	 	come	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	romantic	love	is	an	 addict 	 ion 	 	:	a	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 addict 	 ion 	 	when	it	's	going	well	,	and	a	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 horr 	 ible 	 	 addict 	 ion 	 	when	it	's	going	 poor 	 ly 	 	.
and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	all	of	the	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	of	 addict 	 ion 	 	.
you	focus	on	the	person	,	you	 obsess 	 ively 	 	think	about	them	,	you	 crav 	 e 	 	them	,	you	distort	 re 	 ality 	 	,	your	 will 	 ing 	 ness 	 	to	take	enormous	 risk 	 s 	 	to	win	 th 	 is 	 	person	.
and	it	's	got	the	three	main	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	of	 addict 	 ion 	 	:	 toler 	 ance 	 	,	you	need	to	see	them	more	,	and	more	,	and	more	;	 withdraw 	 al 	 s 	 	;	and	last	,	 re 	 lapse 	 	.
i	've	got	a	girlfriend	who	's	just	 get 	 ting 	 	over	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	love	 af 	 fair 	 	.	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	about	eight	 month 	 s 	 	,	she	's	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	feel	better	.
and	she	was	 driv 	 ing 	 	 a 	 long 	 	in	her	car	the	other	day	,	and	 sudden 	 ly 	 	she	heard	a	song	on	the	car	radio	that	 re 	 minded 	 	her	of	 th 	 is 	 	man	.
and	she	--	not	 on 	 ly 	 	did	the	instant	 crav 	 ing 	 	come	back	,	but	she	had	to	pull	over	from	the	side	of	the	road	and	cry	.
so	,	one	thing	i	would	like	the	medical	community	,	and	the	legal	community	,	and	even	the	college	community	,	to	see	if	they	can	understand	,	that	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	romantic	love	is	one	of	the	most	 addict 	 ive 	 	 sub 	 stance 	 s 	 	on	earth	.
i	would	 al 	 so 	 	like	to	tell	the	world	that	 animal 	 s 	 	love	.
there	's	not	an	animal	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	that	will	 copul 	 ate 	 	with	 any 	 thing 	 	that	 come 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	.
too	old	,	too	young	,	too	 scru 	 ffy 	 	,	too	stupid	,	and	they	wo	n't	do	it	.
 un 	 less 	 	you	're	 s 	 tuck 	 	in	a	 labor 	 atory 	 	cage	--	and	you	know	,	if	you	 s 	 pend 	 	your	entire	life	in	a	little	box	,	you	're	not	going	to	be	 a 	 s 	 	 pick 	 y 	 	about	who	you	have	 s 	 ex 	 	with	--	but	i	've	 look 	 ed 	 	in	a	hundred	species	,	and	 every 	 where 	 	in	the	wild	,	 animal 	 s 	 	have	 favor 	 ites 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	matter	of	fact	 etho 	 logists 	 	know	 th 	 is 	 	.
there	are	over	eight	 word 	 s 	 	for	what	they	call	``	animal	 favor 	 it 	 ism 	 	:	``	 select 	 ive 	 	 pro 	 cept 	 ivity 	 	,	mate	choice	,	female	choice	,	sexual	choice	.
and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	there	are	now	three	academic	 article 	 s 	 	in	which	they	've	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	 attract 	 ion 	 	,	which	may	 on 	 ly 	 	last	for	a	second	,	but	it	's	a	definite	 attract 	 ion 	 	,	and	either	 th 	 is 	 	same	brain	region	,	 th 	 is 	 	reward	system	,	or	the	 chemical 	 s 	 	of	that	reward	system	are	 involve 	 d 	 	.
in	fact	,	i	think	animal	 attract 	 ion 	 	can	be	instant	--	you	can	see	an	elephant	 instant 	 ly 	 	go	for	 an 	 other 	 	elephant	.
and	i	think	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	the	origin	of	what	you	and	i	call	``	love	at	first	sight	.	``
people	have	often	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	 whet 	 her 	 	what	i	know	about	love	 ha 	 s 	 	 spoil 	 ed 	 	it	for	me	.
and	i	just	 simpl 	 y 	 	say	,	``	 hard 	 ly 	 	.	``
you	can	know	every	single	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 	in	a	piece	of	chocolate	cake	,	and	then	when	you	 s 	 it 	 	down	and	eat	that	cake	,	you	can	still	feel	that	joy	.
and	 certain 	 ly 	 	,	i	make	all	the	same	 mistak 	 es 	 	that	 every 	 body 	 	else	 do 	 es 	 	too	,	but	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 deepen 	 ed 	 	my	 understand 	 ing 	 	and	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	for	all	human	life	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	matter	of	fact	,	in	new	york	,	i	often	catch	 my 	 self 	 	looking	in	baby	 carriage 	 s 	 	and	 feel 	 ing 	 	a	little	sorry	for	the	 to 	 t 	 	.	and	in	fact	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	i	feel	a	little	sorry	for	the	chicken	on	my	 d 	 inner 	 	plate	,	when	i	think	of	how	 intens 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	brain	system	is	.
our	 new 	 est 	 	experiment	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 hatch 	 ed 	 	by	my	 col 	 league 	 	,	art	aron	--	 put 	 ting 	 	people	who	are	 report 	 ing 	 	that	they	are	still	in	love	,	in	a	long	-	term	relationship	,	 in 	 to 	 	the	functional	mri	.
we	've	put	five	people	in	so	far	,	and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	we	found	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	thing	.	they	're	not	 ly 	 ing 	 	.
the	brain	 area 	 s 	 	 associate 	 d 	 	with	 intens 	 e 	 	romantic	love	still	 be 	 come 	 	active	,	25	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
there	are	still	 man 	 y 	 	 question 	 s 	 	to	be	 answer 	 ed 	 	and	 ask 	 ed 	 	about	romantic	love	.
the	question	that	i	'm	 work 	 ing 	 	on	right	 th 	 is 	 	minute	--	and	i	'm	 on 	 ly 	 	going	to	say	it	for	a	second	,	and	then	end	--	is	,	why	do	you	fall	in	love	with	one	person	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 an 	 other 	 	?
i	never	would	have	even	thought	to	think	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	match.com	,	the	 inter 	 net 	 	-	 d 	 ating 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	came	to	me	three	 year 	 s 	 	ago	and	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	that	question	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	i	do	n't	know	.
i	know	what	 happen 	 s 	 	in	the	brain	,	when	you	do	 be 	 come 	 	in	love	,	but	i	do	n't	know	why	you	fall	in	love	with	one	person	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 an 	 other 	 	.
and	so	,	i	've	 s 	 pent 	 	the	last	three	 year 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	that	you	fall	in	love	with	one	person	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 an 	 other 	 	,	that	 psycho 	 logists 	 	can	tell	you	.
and	we	tend	to	fall	in	love	with	 some 	 body 	 	from	the	same	 socio 	 economic 	 	 back 	 ground 	 	,	the	same	general	level	of	 intellig 	 ence 	 	,	the	same	general	level	of	good	 look 	 s 	 	,	the	same	religious	 value 	 s 	 	.
your	 child 	 hood 	 	 certain 	 ly 	 	 play 	 s 	 	a	role	,	but	 no 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	how	.
and	that	's	about	it	,	that	's	all	they	know	.
no	,	they	've	never	found	the	way	two	 personal 	 ities 	 	fit	together	to	make	a	good	relationship	.
so	,	it	 beg 	 an 	 	to	occur	to	me	that	 may 	 be 	 	your	biology	 pull 	 s 	 	you	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	some	people	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 an 	 other 	 	.
and	i	have	 concoct 	 ed 	 	a	 question 	 naire 	 	to	see	to	what	degree	you	express	dopamine	,	serotonin	,	estrogen	and	testosterone	.
i	think	we	've	 evolv 	 ed 	 	four	 ver 	 y 	 	broad	 personal 	 ity 	 	 type 	 s 	 	 associate 	 d 	 	with	the	 ratio 	 s 	 	of	these	four	 chemical 	 s 	 	in	the	brain	.
and	on	 th 	 is 	 	 d 	 ating 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	that	i	have	 create 	 d 	 	,	 call 	 ed 	 	chemistry.com	,	i	ask	you	first	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 question 	 s 	 	to	see	to	what	degree	you	express	these	 chemical 	 s 	 	,	and	i	'm	 watch 	 ing 	 	who	 choos 	 es 	 	who	to	love	.
and	3.7	million	people	have	taken	the	 question 	 naire 	 	in	america	.	about	600,000	people	have	taken	it	in	33	other	 count 	 ries 	 	.
i	'm	 put 	 ting 	 	the	data	together	now	,	and	at	some	point	--	there	will	 al 	 ways 	 	be	magic	to	love	,	but	i	think	i	will	come	 close 	 r 	 	to	 understand 	 ing 	 	why	it	is	you	can	walk	 in 	 to 	 	a	room	and	 every 	 body 	 	is	from	your	 back 	 ground 	 	,	your	same	general	level	of	 intellig 	 ence 	 	,	your	same	general	level	of	good	 look 	 s 	 	,	and	you	do	n't	feel	 pull 	 ed 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	all	of	them	.
i	think	there	's	biology	to	that	.
i	think	we	're	going	to	end	up	,	in	the	next	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	to	understand	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	brain	 mechan 	 ism 	 s 	 	that	pull	us	to	one	person	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 an 	 other 	 	.
so	,	i	will	close	with	 th 	 is 	 	.	these	are	my	 old 	 er 	 	people	.
faulkner	once	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	the	past	is	not	dead	,	it	's	not	even	the	past	.	``
 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	we	carry	a	lot	of	 lugg 	 age 	 	from	our	 yester 	 year 	 	in	the	human	brain	.
and	so	,	there	's	one	thing	that	 make 	 s 	 	me	pursue	my	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	human	nature	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 mind 	 s 	 	me	of	it	.	these	are	two	women	.
women	tend	to	get	 in 	 timacy 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	than	men	do	.
women	get	 in 	 timacy 	 	from	face	-	to	-	face	 talk 	 ing 	 	.
we	swivel	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	each	other	,	we	do	what	we	call	the	``	 anchor 	 ing 	 	 gaz 	 e 	 	``	and	we	talk	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 in 	 timacy 	 	to	women	.
i	think	it	 come 	 s 	 	from	 million 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	of	 hold 	 ing 	 	that	baby	in	front	of	your	face	,	 ca 	 jol 	 ing 	 	it	,	 reprimand 	 ing 	 	it	,	 educ 	 ating 	 	it	with	 word 	 s 	 	.
men	tend	to	get	 in 	 timacy 	 	from	side	-	by	-	side	 do 	 ing 	 	.	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	one	guy	 look 	 s 	 	up	,	the	other	guy	will	look	away	.
i	think	it	 come 	 s 	 	from	 million 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	of	 stand 	 ing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	that	--	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	the	bush	,	looking	straight	 a 	 head 	 	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	hit	that	buffalo	on	the	head	with	a	rock	.
i	think	,	for	 million 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	men	 face 	 d 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 ene 	 mies 	 	,	they	 s 	 at 	 	side	by	side	with	 friend 	 s 	 	.
so	my	final	 state 	 ment 	 	is	:	love	is	in	us	.
it	's	 deep 	 ly 	 	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	in	the	brain	.
our	 challeng 	 e 	 	is	to	understand	each	other	.	thank	you	.
