so	i	am	a	pediatric	cancer	doctor	and	stem	-	cell	 research 	 er 	 	at	stanford	university	where	my	 clinic 	 al 	 	focus	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	bone	 mar 	 row 	 	 transplant 	 ation 	 	.
now	,	inspired	by	jill	bolte	taylor	last	year	,	i	did	n't	 br 	 ing 	 	a	human	brain	,	but	i	did	 br 	 ing 	 	a	liter	of	bone	 mar 	 row 	 	.
and	bone	 mar 	 row 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	what	we	use	to	 s 	 ave 	 	the	 live 	 s 	 	of	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 patient 	 s 	 	,	most	of	whom	have	 advance 	 d 	 	 malign 	 ancies 	 	like	leukemia	and	 lymph 	 oma 	 	and	some	other	 disease 	 s 	 	.
so	,	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	my	transplant	 fellow 	 ship 	 	at	stanford	.
i	'm	in	the	 oper 	 ating 	 	room	.	we	have	bob	here	,	who	is	a	volunteer	donor	.
we	're	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	his	 mar 	 row 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	country	to	 s 	 ave 	 	the	life	of	a	child	with	leukemia	.
so	 actual 	 ly 	 	how	do	we	harvest	 th 	 is 	 	bone	 mar 	 row 	 	?
well	we	have	a	whole	o.r	.	team	,	general	 an 	 est 	 hesia 	 	,	 nurse 	 s 	 	,	and	 an 	 other 	 	doctor	 a 	 cross 	 	from	me	.
bob	's	on	the	table	,	and	we	take	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	small	needle	,	you	know	,	not	too	big	.
and	the	way	we	do	 th 	 is 	 	is	we	 bas 	 ically 	 	place	 th 	 is 	 	through	the	soft	tissue	,	and	kind	of	punch	it	 in 	 to 	 	the	hard	bone	,	 in 	 to 	 	the	tuchus	--	that	's	a	technical	term	--	and	 aspir 	 ate 	 	about	10	mls	of	bone	 mar 	 row 	 	out	,	each	time	,	with	a	syringe	.
and	hand	it	off	to	the	nurse	.	she	 squirt 	 s 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	tin	.
 hand 	 s 	 	it	back	to	me	.	and	we	do	that	 aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	.
about	200	 time 	 s 	 	 usual 	 ly 	 	.
and	by	the	end	of	 th 	 is 	 	my	arm	is	sore	,	i	've	got	a	 call 	 us 	 	on	my	hand	,
let	 al 	 one 	 	bob	,	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	rear	end	 look 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	more	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	like	swiss	cheese	.
so	i	'm	 think 	 ing 	 	,	you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	procedure	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 change 	 d 	 	in	about	40	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	there	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	a	better	way	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	i	thought	of	a	 minimal 	 ly 	 	invasive	approach	,
and	a	new	 de 	 vice 	 	that	we	call	the	 mar 	 row 	 	 min 	 er 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	it	.
and	the	 mar 	 row 	 	 min 	 er 	 	,	the	way	it	 work 	 s 	 	is	 show 	 n 	 	here	.
our	standard	see	-	through	patient	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	 enter 	 ing 	 	the	bone	 dozen 	 s 	 	of	 time 	 s 	 	,	we	enter	just	once	,	 in 	 to 	 	the	front	of	the	hip	or	the	back	of	the	hip	.	and	we	have	a	 flex 	 ible 	 	,	powered	catheter	with	a	special	wire	loop	tip	that	 stay 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	the	 crunch 	 y 	 	part	of	the	 mar 	 row 	 	and	 follow 	 s 	 	the	 con 	 tour 	 s 	 	of	the	hip	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 move 	 s 	 	around	.
so	it	 en 	 able 	 s 	 	you	to	 ver 	 y 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	 aspir 	 ate 	 	,	or	suck	out	,	rich	bone	 mar 	 row 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	through	one	hole	.
we	can	do	 multi 	 ple 	 	 pass 	 es 	 	through	that	same	entry	.
no	 robot 	 s 	 	 requir 	 ed 	 	.
and	,	so	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	bob	can	just	get	one	 punctu 	 re 	 	,	local	 an 	 est 	 hesia 	 	,	and	do	 th 	 is 	 	harvest	 a 	 s 	 	an	 out 	 patient 	 	.
so	i	did	a	few	 prototype 	 s 	 	.	i	got	a	small	little	grant	at	stanford	.
and	 play 	 ed 	 	around	with	 th 	 is 	 	a	little	bit	.
and	our	team	 member 	 s 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	technology	.
and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	we	got	two	large	 animal 	 s 	 	,	and	pig	 stud 	 ies 	 	.
and	we	found	,	to	our	surprise	,	that	we	not	 on 	 ly 	 	got	bone	 mar 	 row 	 	out	,	but	we	got	10	 time 	 s 	 	the	stem	cell	activity	in	the	 mar 	 row 	 	from	the	 mar 	 row 	 	 min 	 er 	 	,	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	the	normal	 de 	 vice 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	was	just	fda	approved	in	the	last	year	.
here	is	a	live	patient	.	you	can	see	it	 follow 	 ing 	 	the	 flex 	 ible 	 	 curv 	 es 	 	around	.
there	will	be	two	 pass 	 es 	 	here	,	in	the	same	patient	,	from	the	same	hole	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	 d 	 one 	 	under	local	 an 	 est 	 hesia 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	 out 	 patient 	 	.
and	we	got	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	about	three	to	six	 time 	 s 	 	more	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	than	the	standard	approach	 d 	 one 	 	on	the	same	patient	.
so	why	should	you	care	?	bone	 mar 	 row 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	rich	source	of	adult	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	.
you	all	know	about	 embryo 	 nic 	 	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	.
they	've	got	great	potential	but	have	n't	yet	 enter 	 ed 	 	 clinic 	 al 	 	 trial 	 s 	 	.
adult	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	are	 through 	 out 	 	our	body	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	the	blood	-	 form 	 ing 	 	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	in	our	bone	 mar 	 row 	 	,
which	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	using	 a 	 s 	 	a	form	of	stem	-	cell	therapy	for	over	40	 year 	 s 	 	.
in	the	last	decade	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	an	explosion	of	use	of	bone	 mar 	 row 	 	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	to	treat	the	patient	's	other	 disease 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	heart	disease	,	vascular	disease	,	 ortho 	 pedic 	 s 	 	,	tissue	 engineer 	 ing 	 	,	even	in	 neuro 	 logy 	 	to	treat	parkinson	's	and	diabetes	.
we	've	just	come	out	,	we	're	 commercial 	 izing 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	year	,	generation	2.0	of	the	 mar 	 row 	 	 min 	 er 	 	.
the	hope	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	 get 	 s 	 	more	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	out	,	which	 transl 	 ates 	 	to	better	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	.
it	may	 encourag 	 e 	 	more	people	to	sign	up	to	be	potential	live	-	saving	bone	 mar 	 row 	 	 donor 	 s 	 	.
it	may	even	 en 	 able 	 	you	to	bank	your	own	 mar 	 row 	 	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	,	when	you	're	 young 	 er 	 	and	 health 	 ier 	 	,	to	use	in	the	future	should	you	need	it	.
and	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	--	and	here	's	a	picture	of	our	bone	 mar 	 row 	 	transplant	 surviv 	 ors 	 	,	who	come	together	for	a	 re 	 un 	 ion 	 	each	year	at	stanford	.
 hope 	 fully 	 	 th 	 is 	 	technology	will	let	us	have	more	of	these	 surviv 	 ors 	 	in	the	future	.
 thank 	 s 	 	.
