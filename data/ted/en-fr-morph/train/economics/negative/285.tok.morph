 th 	 is 	 	is	a	work	in	process	,	based	on	some	 comment 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	made	at	ted	two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	about	the	need	for	the	 s 	 to 	 rage 	 	of	 vaccin 	 e 	 	.
 nar 	 rator 	 	:	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	,	1.6	billion	people	do	n't	have	access	to	 electric 	 ity 	 	,	 refrige 	 ration 	 	or	 store 	 d 	 	 fuel 	 s 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	problem	.	it	 impact 	 s 	 	:	the	spread	of	disease	,	the	 s 	 to 	 rage 	 	of	food	and	medicine	and	the	quality	of	life	.	so	here	's	the	plan	:	 in 	 expensive 	 	 refrige 	 ration 	 	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	use	 electric 	 ity 	 	,	 pro 	 pane 	 	,	gas	,	 ker 	 os 	 ene 	 	or	 consum 	 able 	 s 	 	.	time	for	some	 thermo 	 dynamic 	 s 	 	.	and	the	story	of	the	intermittent	absorption	 refrige 	 rator 	 	.	adam	grosser	:	so	29	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	had	 th 	 is 	 	thermo	teacher	who	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	absorption	and	 refrige 	 ration 	 	.
it	's	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 s 	 tuck 	 	in	my	head	.
it	was	a	lot	like	the	stirling	engine	:	it	was	cool	,	but	you	did	n't	know	what	to	do	with	it	.
and	it	was	 invent 	 ed 	 	in	1858	,	by	 th 	 is 	 	guy	ferdinand	carre	,	but	he	could	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	build	 any 	 thing 	 	with	it	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 tool 	 s 	 	of	the	time	.
 th 	 is 	 	crazy	canadian	named	powel	crosley	 commercial 	 ized 	 	 th 	 is 	 	thing	 call 	 ed 	 	the	icyball	in	1928	,	and	it	was	a	 re 	 ally 	 	neat	idea	,	and	i	'll	get	to	why	it	did	n't	work	,	but	here	's	how	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
there	's	two	 sphere 	 s 	 	and	they	're	 separat 	 ed 	 	in	distance	.
one	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 work 	 ing 	 	fluid	,	water	and	 ammo 	 nia 	 	,	and	the	other	is	a	 condens 	 er 	 	.
you	heat	up	one	side	,	the	hot	side	.
the	 ammo 	 nia 	 	 evapo 	 rates 	 	and	it	re	-	 condens 	 es 	 	in	the	other	side	.
you	let	it	cool	to	room	temperature	,	and	then	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	 ammo 	 nia 	 	re	-	 evapo 	 rates 	 	and	 combine 	 s 	 	with	the	water	back	on	the	erstwhile	hot	side	,	it	 create 	 s 	 	a	 power 	 ful 	 	 cool 	 ing 	 	effect	.
so	,	it	was	a	great	idea	that	did	n't	work	at	all	:	it	 ble 	 w 	 	up	.
 be 	 cause 	 	using	 ammo 	 nia 	 	you	get	 huge 	 ly 	 	high	 pressure 	 s 	 	if	you	heated	them	wrong	.
it	 top 	 ped 	 	400	psi	.	the	 ammo 	 nia 	 	was	toxic	.	it	 spray 	 ed 	 	 every 	 where 	 	.
but	it	was	kind	of	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	thought	.
so	,	the	great	thing	about	2006	is	there	's	a	lot	of	 re 	 ally 	 	great	 computation 	 al 	 	work	you	can	do	.
so	,	we	got	the	whole	 thermo 	 dynamic 	 s 	 	 depart 	 ment 	 	at	stanford	 involve 	 d 	 	--
a	lot	of	 computation 	 al 	 	fluid	 dynamic 	 s 	 	.
we	 prov 	 ed 	 	that	most	of	the	 ammo 	 nia 	 	 refrige 	 ration 	 	 table 	 s 	 	are	wrong	.
we	found	some	non	-	toxic	refrigerants	that	 work 	 ed 	 	at	 ver 	 y 	 	low	vapor	 pressure 	 s 	 	.
 br 	 ought 	 	in	a	team	from	the	u.k.	--	there	's	a	lot	of	great	 refrige 	 ration 	 	people	,	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	,	in	the	u.k.	--	and	built	a	test	rig	,	and	 prov 	 ed 	 	that	,	in	fact	,	we	could	make	a	low	pressure	,	non	-	toxic	 refrige 	 rator 	 	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	way	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
you	put	it	on	a	 cook 	 ing 	 	fire	.
most	people	have	 cook 	 ing 	 	 fire 	 s 	 	in	the	world	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	camel	dung	or	wood	.
it	 heat 	 s 	 	up	for	about	30	 minute 	 s 	 	,	 cool 	 s 	 	for	an	hour	.
put	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	 contain 	 er 	 	and	it	will	 refrige 	 rate 	 	for	24	 hour 	 s 	 	.
it	 look 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	fifth	prototype	.	it	's	not	 quit 	 e 	 	 d 	 one 	 	.
 weigh 	 s 	 	about	eight	 pound 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	way	it	 work 	 s 	 	.	you	put	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	15	-	liter	vessel	,	about	three	 gallon 	 s 	 	,	and	it	'll	cool	it	down	to	just	above	freezing	--	three	 degree 	 s 	 	above	freezing	--
for	24	 hour 	 s 	 	in	a	30	degree	c	environment	.	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	cheap	.
we	think	we	can	build	these	in	high	 volume 	 s 	 	for	about	25	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	in	low	 volume 	 s 	 	for	about	40	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
and	we	think	we	can	make	 refrige 	 ration 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 every 	 body 	 	can	have	.
thank	you	.
