hawa	abdi	:	 man 	 y 	 	people	--	20	 year 	 s 	 	for	somalia	--	[	 we 	 re 	 	]	 fight 	 ing 	 	.
so	there	was	no	job	,	no	food	.
children	,	most	of	them	,	 be 	 came 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 mal 	 nourish 	 ed 	 	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
deqo	mohamed	:	so	 a 	 s 	 	you	know	,	 al 	 ways 	 	in	a	civil	war	,	the	 one 	 s 	 	 affect 	 ed 	 	most	[	are	]	the	women	and	children	.
so	our	 patient 	 s 	 	are	women	and	children	.
and	they	are	in	our	 back 	 yard 	 	.
it	's	our	home	.	we	welcome	them	.
that	's	the	camp	that	we	have	in	now	90,000	people	,	where	75	percent	of	them	are	women	and	children	.
pat	mitchell	:	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	your	hospital	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 in 	 side 	 	.
ha	:	we	are	 do 	 ing 	 	c	-	 section 	 s 	 	and	different	 operation 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	people	need	some	help	.
there	is	no	government	to	protect	them	.
dm	:	every	 morn 	 ing 	 	we	have	about	400	 patient 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	more	or	less	.
but	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	we	are	 on 	 ly 	 	five	 doctor 	 s 	 	and	16	 nurse 	 s 	 	,	and	we	are	 physical 	 ly 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 exhaust 	 ed 	 	to	see	all	of	them	.
but	we	take	the	severe	 one 	 s 	 	,	and	we	 re 	 schedule 	 	the	other	 one 	 s 	 	the	next	day	.
it	is	 ver 	 y 	 	tough	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	it	's	the	women	who	are	 carry 	 ing 	 	the	children	;	it	's	the	women	who	come	 in 	 to 	 	the	 hospital 	 s 	 	;	it	's	the	women	[	are	]	building	the	 house 	 s 	 	.
that	's	 the 	 ir 	 	house	.
and	we	have	a	school	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	our	bright	--	we	 open 	 ed 	 	[	in	the	]	last	two	 year 	 s 	 	[	an	]	 element 	 ary 	 	school	where	we	have	850	children	,	and	the	 major 	 ity 	 	are	women	and	 girl 	 s 	 	.
pm	:	and	the	 doctor 	 s 	 	have	some	 ver 	 y 	 	big	 rule 	 s 	 	about	who	can	get	 treat 	 ed 	 	at	the	clinic	.
would	you	explain	the	 rule 	 s 	 	for	 ad 	 mission 	 	?
ha	:	the	people	who	are	coming	to	us	,	we	are	 wel 	 coming 	 	.
we	are	sharing	with	them	 what 	 ever 	 	we	have	.
but	there	are	 on 	 ly 	 	two	 rule 	 s 	 	.
first	rule	:	there	is	no	 cl 	 an 	 	 distinguish 	 ed 	 	and	 politic 	 al 	 	division	in	somali	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
[	 whom 	 ever 	 	]	 make 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	we	throw	out	.
the	second	:	no	man	can	beat	his	wife	.
if	he	beat	,	we	will	put	[	him	]	in	jail	,	and	we	will	call	the	 el 	 d 	 est 	 	people	.
 un 	 til 	 	they	identify	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	we	'll	never	 re 	 lease 	 	him	.
that	's	our	two	 rule 	 s 	 	.
the	other	thing	that	i	have	 real 	 ized 	 	,	that	the	woman	is	the	most	strong	person	all	over	the	world	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	last	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	somali	woman	 ha 	 s 	 	stood	up	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	the	 lead 	 ers 	 	,	and	we	are	the	 lead 	 ers 	 	of	our	community	and	the	hope	of	our	future	 generation 	 s 	 	.
we	are	not	just	the	 help 	 less 	 	and	the	 victim 	 s 	 	of	the	civil	war	.
we	can	reconcile	.
we	can	do	 every 	 thing 	 	.
dm	:	 a 	 s 	 	my	mother	 s 	 aid 	 	,	we	are	the	future	hope	,	and	the	men	are	 on 	 ly 	 	 kill 	 ing 	 	in	somalia	.
so	we	came	up	with	these	two	 rule 	 s 	 	.
in	a	camp	with	90,000	people	,	you	have	to	come	up	with	some	 rule 	 s 	 	or	there	is	going	to	be	some	 fight 	 s 	 	.
so	there	is	no	 cl 	 an 	 	division	,	and	no	man	can	beat	his	wife	.
and	we	have	a	little	 s 	 to 	 rage 	 	room	where	we	 convert 	 ed 	 	a	jail	.
so	if	you	beat	your	wife	,	you	're	going	to	be	there	.
so	 empower 	 ing 	 	the	women	and	giving	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	--	we	are	there	for	them	.	they	are	not	 al 	 one 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	.
pm	:	you	're	running	a	medical	clinic	.
it	 br 	 ought 	 	much	,	much	 need 	 ed 	 	medical	care	to	people	who	would	n't	get	it	.
you	're	 al 	 so 	 	running	a	civil	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
you	've	 create 	 d 	 	your	own	 rule 	 s 	 	,	in	which	women	and	children	are	 get 	 ting 	 	a	different	sense	of	security	.
talk	to	me	about	your	decision	,	dr.	abdi	,	and	your	decision	,	dr.	mohamed	,	to	work	together	--	for	you	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	doctor	and	to	work	with	your	mother	in	these	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	.
ha	:	my	age	--	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	born	in	1947	--	we	 we 	 re 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	,	at	that	time	,	government	,	law	and	order	.
but	one	day	,	i	went	to	the	hospital	--	my	mother	was	sick	--	and	i	saw	the	hospital	,	how	they	[	 we 	 re 	 	]	 treat 	 ing 	 	the	 doctor 	 s 	 	,	how	they	[	are	]	 commit 	 ted 	 	to	help	the	sick	people	.
i	 admire 	 d 	 	them	,	and	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	doctor	.
my	mother	 di 	 ed 	 	,	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	when	i	was	12	 year 	 s 	 	[	old	]	.
then	my	father	 allow 	 ed 	 	me	to	proceed	[	with	]	my	hope	.
my	mother	 di 	 ed 	 	in	[	a	]	 gyn 	 eco 	 logy 	 	 complic 	 ation 	 	,	so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	 gyn 	 eco 	 logy 	 	 special 	 ist 	 	.
that	's	why	i	 be 	 came 	 	a	doctor	.
so	dr.	deqo	 ha 	 s 	 	to	explain	.
dm	:	for	me	,	my	mother	was	 pre 	 par 	 ing 	 	[	me	]	when	i	was	a	child	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	doctor	,	but	i	 re 	 ally 	 	did	n't	want	to	.
 may 	 be 	 	i	should	 be 	 come 	 	an	historian	,	or	 may 	 be 	 	a	 report 	 er 	 	.
i	 love 	 d 	 	it	,	but	it	did	n't	work	.
when	the	war	broke	out	--	civil	war	--	i	saw	how	my	mother	was	 help 	 ing 	 	and	how	she	 re 	 ally 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	the	help	,	and	how	the	care	is	essential	to	the	woman	to	be	a	woman	doctor	in	somalia	and	help	the	women	and	children	.
and	i	thought	,	 may 	 be 	 	i	can	be	a	 report 	 er 	 	and	doctor	 gyn 	 ecologist 	 	.
so	i	went	to	russia	,	and	my	mother	 al 	 so 	 	,	[	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	]	time	of	[	the	]	soviet	 un 	 ion 	 	.
so	some	of	our	character	,	 may 	 be 	 	we	will	come	with	a	strong	soviet	 back 	 ground 	 	of	training	.
so	that	's	how	i	 decide 	 d 	 	[	to	do	]	the	same	.
my	sister	was	different	.
she	's	here	.	she	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	doctor	.
she	 graduate 	 d 	 	in	russia	 al 	 so 	 	.
and	to	go	back	and	to	work	with	our	mother	is	just	what	we	saw	in	the	civil	war	--	when	i	was	16	,	and	my	sister	was	11	,	when	the	civil	war	broke	out	.
so	it	was	the	need	and	the	people	we	saw	in	the	early	'90s	--	that	's	what	made	us	go	back	and	work	for	them	.
pm	:	so	what	is	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 challeng 	 e 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	,	mother	and	daughter	,	in	 s 	 uch 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 scar 	 y 	 	 situ 	 ations 	 	?
ha	:	 y 	 es 	 	,	i	was	 work 	 ing 	 	in	a	tough	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
and	when	i	saw	the	people	who	 need 	 ed 	 	me	,	i	was	 stay 	 ing 	 	with	them	to	help	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	[	could	]	do	 some 	 thing 	 	for	them	.
most	people	 fl 	 ed 	 	 a 	 broad 	 	.
but	i	 remain 	 ed 	 	with	 t 	 hose 	 	people	,	and	i	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	--	[	any	]	little	thing	i	[	could	]	do	.
i	 succeed 	 ed 	 	in	my	place	.
now	my	place	is	90,000	people	who	are	 respect 	 ing 	 	each	other	,	who	are	not	 fight 	 ing 	 	.
but	we	try	to	stand	on	our	feet	,	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	,	little	 thing 	 s 	 	,	we	can	for	our	people	.
and	i	'm	 thank 	 ful 	 	for	my	 daughter 	 s 	 	.
when	they	come	to	me	,	they	help	me	to	treat	the	people	,	to	help	.
they	do	 every 	 thing 	 	for	them	.
they	have	 d 	 one 	 	what	i	 desir 	 e 	 	to	do	for	them	.
pm	:	what	's	the	best	part	of	 work 	 ing 	 	with	your	mother	,	and	the	most	 challeng 	 ing 	 	part	for	you	?
dm	:	she	's	 ver 	 y 	 	tough	;	it	's	most	 challeng 	 ing 	 	.
she	 al 	 ways 	 	 expect 	 s 	 	us	to	do	more	.
and	 re 	 ally 	 	when	you	think	[	you	]	can	not	do	it	,	she	will	push	you	,	and	i	can	do	it	.
that	's	the	best	part	.
she	 show 	 s 	 	us	,	 train 	 s 	 	us	how	to	do	and	how	to	be	better	[	people	]	and	how	to	do	long	 hour 	 s 	 	in	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	--	300	 patient 	 s 	 	per	day	,	10	,	20	 s 	 urge 	 ries 	 	,	and	still	you	have	to	manage	the	camp	--	that	's	how	she	 train 	 s 	 	us	.
it	is	not	like	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 off 	 ice 	 s 	 	here	,	20	 patient 	 s 	 	,	you	're	 tire 	 d 	 	.
you	see	300	 patient 	 s 	 	,	20	 s 	 urge 	 ries 	 	and	90,000	people	to	manage	.
pm	:	but	you	do	it	for	good	 reason 	 s 	 	.
wait	.	wait	.
ha	:	thank	you	.	dm	:	thank	you	.
ha	:	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.	dm	:	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
