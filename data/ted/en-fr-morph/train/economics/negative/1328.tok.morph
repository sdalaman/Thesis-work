in	the	1980s	in	the	 commun 	 ist 	 	eastern	germany	,	if	you	owned	a	 type 	 writer 	 	,	you	had	to	register	it	with	the	government	.
you	had	to	register	a	 s 	 ample 	 	sheet	of	text	out	of	the	 type 	 writer 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	 d 	 one 	 	so	the	government	could	track	where	text	was	coming	from	.
if	they	found	a	paper	which	had	the	wrong	kind	of	thought	,	they	could	track	down	who	 create 	 d 	 	that	thought	.
and	we	in	the	west	could	n't	understand	how	 any 	 body 	 	could	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	how	much	 th 	 is 	 	would	restrict	 free 	 dom 	 	of	speech	.
we	would	never	do	that	in	our	own	 count 	 ries 	 	.
but	 to 	 day 	 	in	2011	,	if	you	go	and	buy	a	color	laser	 print 	 er 	 	from	any	major	laser	 print 	 er 	 	 manufactur 	 er 	 	and	print	a	page	,	that	page	will	end	up	 hav 	 ing 	 	 s 	 light 	 	yellow	 dot 	 s 	 	 print 	 ed 	 	on	every	single	page	in	a	pattern	which	 make 	 s 	 	the	page	 un 	 ique 	 	to	you	and	to	your	 print 	 er 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	to	us	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	 no 	 body 	 	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	making	a	 fu 	 s 	 s 	 	about	it	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	the	ways	that	our	own	 government 	 s 	 	are	using	technology	against	us	,	the	 citizen 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	main	three	 source 	 s 	 	of	 on 	 line 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
if	we	take	a	look	at	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	the	 on 	 line 	 	world	,	we	can	group	the	 attack 	 s 	 	based	on	the	attackers	.
we	have	three	main	 group 	 s 	 	.
we	have	 on 	 line 	 	 criminal 	 s 	 	.
like	here	,	we	have	mr.	dimitry	golubov	from	the	city	of	kiev	in	ukraine	.
and	the	 motive 	 s 	 	of	 on 	 line 	 	 criminal 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	to	understand	.
these	 guy 	 s 	 	make	money	.
they	use	 on 	 line 	 	 attack 	 s 	 	to	make	 lot 	 s 	 	of	money	,	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 case 	 s 	 	of	 millionaire 	 s 	 	 on 	 line 	 	,	_UNK_	,	who	made	money	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 attack 	 s 	 	.
here	's	vladimir	_UNK_	form	_UNK_	in	estonia	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	alfred	gonzalez	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	stephen	watt	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	bjorn	sundin	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	matthew	anderson	,	_UNK_	_UNK_	and	so	on	and	so	on	.
these	 guy 	 s 	 	make	 the 	 ir 	 	 fortune 	 s 	 	 on 	 line 	 	,	but	they	make	it	through	the	 il 	 legal 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	of	using	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 bank 	 ing 	 	trojans	to	steal	money	from	our	bank	 account 	 s 	 	while	we	do	 on 	 line 	 	 bank 	 ing 	 	,	or	with	 key 	 loggers 	 	to	collect	our	credit	card	information	while	we	are	 do 	 ing 	 	 on 	 line 	 	 shop 	 ping 	 	from	an	 infect 	 ed 	 	computer	.
the	u.s.	secret	service	,	two	 month 	 s 	 	ago	,	froze	the	swiss	bank	account	of	mr.	sam	jain	right	here	,	and	that	bank	account	had	14.9	million	u.s.	 dollar 	 s 	 	on	it	when	it	was	 froze 	 n 	 	.
mr.	jain	 him 	 self 	 	is	on	the	loose	;	 no 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	where	he	is	.
and	i	claim	it	's	 al 	 ready 	 	 to 	 day 	 	that	it	's	more	 like 	 ly 	 	for	any	of	us	to	 be 	 come 	 	the	victim	of	a	crime	 on 	 line 	 	than	here	in	the	real	world	.
and	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	obvious	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	 on 	 ly 	 	going	to	get	 wo 	 rse 	 	.
in	the	future	,	the	 major 	 ity 	 	of	crime	will	be	 happen 	 ing 	 	 on 	 line 	 	.
the	second	major	group	of	attackers	that	we	are	 watch 	 ing 	 	 to 	 day 	 	are	not	 motiv 	 ated 	 	by	money	.
they	're	 motiv 	 ated 	 	by	 some 	 thing 	 	else	--	 motiv 	 ated 	 	by	 protest 	 s 	 	,	 motiv 	 ated 	 	by	an	opinion	,	 motiv 	 ated 	 	by	the	 laugh 	 s 	 	.
 group 	 s 	 	like	 anonym 	 ous 	 	have	 ris 	 en 	 	up	over	the	last	12	 month 	 s 	 	and	have	 be 	 come 	 	a	major	player	in	the	field	of	 on 	 line 	 	 attack 	 s 	 	.
so	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	three	main	attackers	:	 criminal 	 s 	 	who	do	it	for	the	money	,	_UNK_	like	 anonym 	 ous 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	it	for	the	protest	,	but	then	the	last	group	are	nation	 state 	 s 	 	,	 government 	 s 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	the	 attack 	 s 	 	.
and	then	we	look	at	 case 	 s 	 	like	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	diginotar	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	prime	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	 government 	 s 	 	attack	against	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 citizen 	 s 	 	.
diginotar	is	a	certificate	 author 	 ity 	 	from	the	netherlands	--	or	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	it	was	.
it	was	running	 in 	 to 	 	 bankrupt 	 cy 	 	last	fall	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 hack 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	.
 some 	 body 	 	broke	in	and	they	 hack 	 ed 	 	it	 thorough 	 ly 	 	.
and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	last	week	in	a	 meet 	 ing 	 	with	dutch	government	 represent 	 ative 	 s 	 	,	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	one	of	the	 lead 	 ers 	 	of	the	team	 whet 	 her 	 	he	found	plausible	that	people	 di 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	diginotar	hack	.
and	his	answer	was	 y 	 es 	 	.
so	how	do	people	die	 a 	 s 	 	the	result	of	a	hack	like	 th 	 is 	 	?
well	diginotar	is	a	c.a	.
they	sell	 certificate 	 s 	 	.
what	do	you	do	with	 certificate 	 s 	 	?
well	you	need	a	certificate	if	you	have	a	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	_UNK_	,	ssl	 encrypt 	 ed 	 	 service 	 s 	 	,	 service 	 s 	 	like	gmail	.
now	we	all	,	or	a	big	part	of	us	,	use	gmail	or	one	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 competitor 	 s 	 	,	but	these	 service 	 s 	 	are	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	popular	in	 total 	 itarian 	 	 state 	 s 	 	like	iran	,	where	 dis 	 sidents 	 	use	foreign	 service 	 s 	 	like	gmail	 be 	 cause 	 	they	know	they	are	more	 trust 	 worthy 	 	than	the	local	 service 	 s 	 	and	they	are	 encrypt 	 ed 	 	over	ssl	 connect 	 ions 	 	,	so	the	local	government	ca	n't	snoop	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 discuss 	 ions 	 	.
 ex 	 cept 	 	they	can	if	they	hack	 in 	 to 	 	a	foreign	c.a	.	and	issue	 r 	 ogue 	 	 certificate 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	with	the	case	of	diginotar	.
what	about	arab	spring	and	 thing 	 s 	 	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	in	egypt	?
well	in	egypt	,	the	_UNK_	 loot 	 ed 	 	the	 head 	 quarter 	 s 	 	of	the	egyptian	secret	police	in	april	2011	,	and	when	they	 we 	 re 	 	 loot 	 ing 	 	the	building	they	found	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 paper 	 s 	 	.
among	 t 	 hose 	 	 paper 	 s 	 	,	was	 th 	 is 	 	 bind 	 er 	 	 en 	 titled 	 	``	_UNK_	.	``
and	 with 	 in 	 	that	 bind 	 er 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 note 	 s 	 	from	a	company	based	in	germany	which	had	 s 	 old 	 	the	egyptian	government	a	set	of	 tool 	 s 	 	for	_UNK_	--	and	in	 ver 	 y 	 	large	scale	--	all	the	communication	of	the	 citizen 	 s 	 	of	the	country	.
they	had	 s 	 old 	 	 th 	 is 	 	tool	for	280,000	 eur 	 os 	 	to	the	egyptian	government	.
the	company	 head 	 quarter 	 s 	 	are	right	here	.
so	western	 government 	 s 	 	are	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	 total 	 itarian 	 	 government 	 s 	 	with	 tool 	 s 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	against	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 citizen 	 s 	 	.
but	western	 government 	 s 	 	are	 do 	 ing 	 	it	to	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	in	germany	,	just	a	couple	of	 week 	 s 	 	ago	the	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	state	trojan	was	found	,	which	was	a	trojan	used	by	german	government	 official 	 s 	 	to	investigate	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 citizen 	 s 	 	.
if	you	are	a	suspect	in	a	criminal	case	,	well	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	obvious	,	your	phone	will	be	 ta 	 pped 	 	.
but	 to 	 day 	 	,	it	 go 	 es 	 	beyond	that	.
they	will	tap	your	 inter 	 net 	 	 connect 	 ion 	 	.
they	will	even	use	 tool 	 s 	 	like	state	trojan	to	infect	your	computer	with	a	trojan	,	which	 en 	 able 	 s 	 	them	to	watch	all	your	communication	,	to	listen	to	your	 on 	 line 	 	 discuss 	 ions 	 	,	to	collect	your	 pass 	 word 	 s 	 	.
now	when	we	think	 deep 	 er 	 	about	 thing 	 s 	 	like	these	,	the	obvious	 respons 	 e 	 	from	people	should	be	that	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	that	 sound 	 s 	 	bad	,	but	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	affect	me	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	a	legal	citizen	.
why	should	i	worry	?
 be 	 cause 	 	i	have	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	hide	.	``	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	argument	,	which	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	sense	.
 pri 	 vac 	 y 	 	is	implied	.
 pri 	 vac 	 y 	 	is	not	up	for	 discuss 	 ion 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	question	between	 pri 	 vac 	 y 	 	against	security	.
it	's	a	question	of	 free 	 dom 	 	against	control	.
and	while	we	might	trust	our	 government 	 s 	 	right	now	,	right	here	in	2011	,	any	right	we	give	away	will	be	 give 	 n 	 	away	for	good	.
and	do	we	trust	,	do	we	 blind 	 ly 	 	trust	,	any	future	government	,	a	government	we	might	have	50	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	?
and	these	are	the	 question 	 s 	 	that	we	have	to	worry	about	for	the	next	50	 year 	 s 	 	.
