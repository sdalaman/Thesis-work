i	have	,	like	,	a	thing	about	 sleep 	 ing 	 	.
i	do	n't	sleep	that	much	,	and	i	've	come	to	 th 	 is 	 	thing	about	,	like	,	not	 sleep 	 ing 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	a	great	virtue	,	after	 year 	 s 	 	of	kind	of	 batt 	 ling 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	 detri 	 ment 	 	,	or	 some 	 thing 	 	.
and	now	i	 re 	 ally 	 	like	sort	of	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	up	,	you	know	.
but	for	 year 	 s 	 	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	up	and	i	think	that	,	like	,	my	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	is	 great 	 ly 	 	 motiv 	 ated 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	insomnia	.
i	lie	awake	.	i	think	 thought 	 s 	 	.	i	walk	 aim 	 lessly 	 	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	i	used	to	walk	more	at	night	.
i	walk	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	day	and	i	follow	people	who	i	think	look	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	once	it	was	on	page	six	in	the	post	,	that	i	was	 cruis 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	guy	,	like	,	sort	of	,	 what 	 ever 	 	,	but	i	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	just	 follow 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	he	had	these	 re 	 ally 	 	great	 shoe 	 s 	 	on	.
and	so	i	was	 follow 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	guy	.
and	i	took	a	picture	of	his	 shoe 	 s 	 	,	and	we	 thank 	 ed 	 	each	other	and	just	went	on	our	way	.
but	i	do	that	all	the	time	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	matter	of	fact	,	i	think	a	lot	of	my	design	 idea 	 s 	 	come	from	 mistak 	 es 	 	and	 trick 	 s 	 	of	the	eye	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	feel	like	,	you	know	,	there	are	so	 man 	 y 	 	 image 	 s 	 	out	there	,	so	 man 	 y 	 	 clothe 	 s 	 	out	there	.
and	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 one 	 s 	 	that	look	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	me	are	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	look	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 mistak 	 en 	 	,	of	course	,	or	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	surprising	.
and	often	,	i	'm	 driv 	 ing 	 	in	a	taxi	and	i	see	a	hole	in	a	shirt	,	or	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 look 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	or	 pre 	 tty 	 	or	functional	in	some	way	that	i	'd	never	 s 	 een 	 	happen	before	.
and	so	i	'd	make	the	car	stop	,	and	i	'd	get	out	of	the	car	and	walk	,	and	see	that	in	fact	there	was	n't	a	hole	,	but	it	was	a	trick	of	my	eye	,	it	was	a	shadow	,	you	know	.
or	if	there	was	a	hole	i	'd	think	like	,	oh	damn	,	there	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 some 	 one 	 	thought	of	that	thought	 al 	 ready 	 	.
 some 	 one 	 	made	that	 mistak 	 e 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	so	i	ca	n't	do	it	 any 	 more 	 	.	i	do	n't	know	where	inspiration	 come 	 s 	 	from	.	it	 do 	 es 	 	not	come	for	me	from	research	.
i	do	n't	get	 necess 	 arily 	 	inspired	by	research	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	matter	of	fact	,	one	of	the	most	 f 	 un 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	i	've	ever	,	ever	 d 	 one 	 	in	my	whole	life	,	was	 th 	 is 	 	christmas	season	at	the	guggenheim	in	new	york	.
i	read	``	peter	and	the	wolf	``	with	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	band	from	juilliard	.
and	i	did	like	,	you	know	,	the	 nar 	 rator 	 	,	and	i	read	it	.
and	i	saw	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	smart	critic	who	i	love	.
 th 	 is 	 	woman	,	joan	acocella	,	who	's	a	friend	of	mine	,	and	she	came	 back 	 stage 	 	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	oh	,	you	know	,	isaac	,	did	you	know	that	,	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	stalinism	and	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	,	you	know	,	like	the	'30s	in	russia	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	how	do	i	know	about	stalinism	?
i	know	about	a	wolf	and	a	bird	and	,	you	know	,	he	ate	the	bird	,	and	then	in	the	end	you	hear	,	you	know	,	you	hear	the	bird	 squeak 	 ing 	 	,	or	 some 	 thing 	 	,	you	know	?
so	i	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	know	that	.	i	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	i	do	my	own	kind	of	research	,	you	know	.
if	i	'm	 commission 	 ed 	 	to	do	the	 cost 	 ume 	 s 	 	for	an	18th	-	century	opera	,	or	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	,	i	will	do	a	lot	of	research	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	not	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	what	i	'm	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	do	.
i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	inspired	by	 movie 	 s 	 	.
the	color	of	 movie 	 s 	 	and	the	way	light	 make 	 s 	 	the	 color 	 s 	 	,	light	from	 be 	 hind 	 	the	 project 	 ion 	 	,	or	light	from	the	 project 	 ion 	 	,	 make 	 s 	 	the	 color 	 s 	 	look	so	 im 	 possible 	 	.
and	 any 	 way 	 	,	roll	 th 	 is 	 	little	clip	,	i	'll	just	show	you	.
i	 s 	 it 	 	up	at	night	and	i	watch	 movie 	 s 	 	and	i	watch	women	in	 movie 	 s 	 	a	lot	.
and	i	think	about	,	you	know	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 role 	 s 	 	,	and	about	how	you	have	to	,	like	,	watch	what	your	 daughter 	 s 	 	look	at	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	look	at	the	way	women	are	 port 	 ray 	 ed 	 	all	the	time	.
 whet 	 her 	 	they	're	kind	of	 glor 	 ified 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	,	or	 whet 	 her 	 	they	're	kind	of	,	you	know	,	 iron 	 ically 	 	 glor 	 ified 	 	,
or	 whet 	 her 	 	they	're	,	you	know	,	sort	of	 deni 	 grat 	 ed 	 	,	or	 iron 	 ically 	 	 deni 	 grat 	 ed 	 	.
i	go	back	to	color	all	the	time	.
color	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 motiv 	 ates 	 	me	a	lot	.	it	's	 rare 	 ly 	 	color	that	i	find	in	nature	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	,	you	know	,	 juxta 	 posed 	 	next	to	artificial	color	,	natural	color	is	so	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
so	that	's	what	i	do	.	i	 stud 	 y 	 	color	a	lot	.
but	for	the	most	part	,	i	think	,	like	,	how	can	i	ever	make	 any 	 thing 	 	that	is	 a 	 s 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 a 	 s 	 	that	image	of	natalie	wood	?	how	can	i	ever	make	 any 	 thing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 a 	 s 	 	greta	garbo	?
i	mean	,	that	's	just	not	possible	,	you	know	.
and	so	that	's	what	 make 	 s 	 	me	lie	awake	at	night	,	i	guess	,	you	know	.
i	want	to	show	you	--	i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	like	a	big	--	i	go	to	 astrologer 	 s 	 	and	 ta 	 rot 	 	card	 read 	 ers 	 	often	,	and	that	's	 an 	 other 	 	thing	that	 motiv 	 ates 	 	me	a	lot	.
people	say	,	oh	,	do	that	.	an	astrologer	 tell 	 s 	 	me	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	.
so	i	do	it	.
when	i	was	about	21	,	an	astrologer	told	me	that	i	was	going	to	meet	the	man	of	my	 dream 	 s 	 	,	and	that	his	name	was	going	to	be	eric	,	right	?
so	,	you	know	,	for	 year 	 s 	 	i	would	go	to	 bar 	 s 	 	and	,	sort	of	,	 any 	 one 	 	i	met	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	name	was	eric	i	was	 hump 	 ing 	 	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	,	or	 some 	 thing 	 	.
and	there	 we 	 re 	 	 time 	 s 	 	when	i	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	so	desperate	i	would	just	,	you	know	,	walk	 in 	 to 	 	a	room	and	just	go	like	,	``	eric	!	``
and	 any 	 body 	 	who	would	turn	around	i	would	,	sort	of	,	make	a	 bee 	 line 	 	for	.
and	i	had	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 ta 	 rot 	 	 read 	 ing 	 	a	long	time	ago	.	the	last	card	he	 pull 	 ed 	 	,	which	was	 represent 	 ing 	 	my	 de 	 s 	 tin 	 y 	 	was	 th 	 is 	 	guy	on	like	a	straw	 boat 	 er 	 	with	a	 can 	 e 	 	and	you	know	,	sort	of	 s 	 pat 	 s 	 	and	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	know	,	a	 min 	 st 	 rel 	 	 s 	 ing 	 er 	 	,	right	?
i	want	to	show	you	 th 	 is 	 	clip	 be 	 cause 	 	i	do	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	crazy	thing	where	i	do	a	 ca 	 bar 	 et 	 	act	.
so	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	check	 th 	 is 	 	out	.	 ver 	 y 	 	 embarrass 	 ing 	 	.
:	thank	you	.	we	can	do	 any 	 thing 	 	you	ask	.
the	name	of	the	show	is	based	on	 th 	 is 	 	story	that	i	have	to	tell	you	about	my	mother	.
it	's	sort	of	an	excerpt	from	a	quote	of	 her 	 s 	 	.
i	was	 d 	 ating 	 	 th 	 is 	 	guy	,	right	?	and	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	with	 be 	 ing 	 	happy	,	i	 s 	 wear 	 	.
i	was	 d 	 ating 	 	 th 	 is 	 	guy	and	it	was	going	on	for	about	a	year	,	right	.
and	we	 we 	 re 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	serious	,	so	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	 invit 	 e 	 	them	all	to	 d 	 inner 	 	,	our	 parent 	 s 	 	.
and	we	,	you	know	,	sort	of	 introduc 	 ed 	 	them	to	each	other	.	my	mother	was	,	sort	of	,	 ver 	 y 	 	sensitive	to	his	mother	,	who	it	 seem 	 ed 	 	was	a	little	bit	 skeptic 	 al 	 	about	the	whole	 alter 	 native 	 	 life 	 style 	 	thing	.
you	know	,	 homo 	 sexual 	 ity 	 	,	right	?
so	my	mother	was	a	little	 offend 	 ed 	 	.	she	 turn 	 ed 	 	to	her	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	are	you	 kid 	 d 	 ing 	 	?	they	have	the	 great 	 est 	 	life	together	.
they	eat	out	,	they	see	 show 	 s 	 	.	``
they	eat	out	,	they	see	 show 	 s 	 	.
that	's	the	name	of	the	show	,	they	eat	out	,	they	--	that	's	on	my	 tomb 	 stone 	 	when	i	die	.
``	he	ate	out	,	he	saw	 show 	 s 	 	,	``	right	?
so	in	 edit 	 ing 	 	these	 clip 	 s 	 	,	i	did	n't	have	the	 au 	 da 	 city 	 	to	edit	a	clip	of	me	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	at	joe	's	pub	.
so	you	'll	have	to	,	like	,	go	check	it	out	and	come	see	me	or	 some 	 thing 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 mort 	 ifying 	 	,	and	yet	it	 feel 	 s 	 	...
i	do	n't	know	how	to	put	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	feel	 a 	 s 	 	little	comfort	 a 	 s 	 	possible	is	a	good	thing	,	you	know	.
and	at	 l 	 east 	 	,	you	know	,	in	my	case	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	i	just	do	one	thing	all	the	time	,	i	do	n't	know	,	i	get	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 bor 	 ed 	 	.	i	bore	 ver 	 y 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	.
and	you	know	,	i	do	n't	say	that	i	do	 every 	 thing 	 	well	,	i	just	say	that	i	do	a	lot	of	 thing 	 s 	 	,	that	's	all	.
and	i	kind	of	try	not	to	look	back	,	you	know	.
 ex 	 cept 	 	,	i	guess	,	that	's	what	 stay 	 ing 	 	up	every	night	is	about	.	like	,	looking	back	and	 think 	 ing 	 	,	what	a	fool	you	made	of	 your 	 self 	 	,	you	know	.	but	i	guess	that	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	right	?
 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	do	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	you	get	to	feel	 lous 	 y 	 	about	 every 	 thing 	 	,	and	not	just	one	,	you	know	.
you	do	n't	master	 feel 	 ing 	 	 lous 	 y 	 	about	one	thing	.
 yea 	 h 	 	,	 exact 	 ly 	 	.
i	will	show	you	 th 	 is 	 	next	thing	,	 s 	 peaking 	 	of	 cost 	 ume 	 s 	 	for	 opera 	 s 	 	.
i	do	work	with	different	 choreograph 	 ers 	 	.
i	work	with	twyla	tharp	a	lot	,	and	i	work	with	mark	morris	a	lot	,	who	is	one	of	my	best	 friend 	 s 	 	.
and	i	designed	three	 opera 	 s 	 	with	him	,
and	the	most	 re 	 cent 	 	one	,	``	king	arthur	.	``
i	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 ing 	 rain 	 ed 	 	in	the	dance	world	since	i	was	a	teenager	.
i	went	to	 perform 	 ing 	 	 art 	 s 	 	high	school	,	where	i	was	an	 a 	 ctor 	 	.
and	 man 	 y 	 	of	my	 friend 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	ballet	 danc 	 ers 	 	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	i	do	n't	know	where	inspiration	 come 	 s 	 	from	.	i	do	n't	know	where	it	 come 	 s 	 	from	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	making	 puppet 	 s 	 	when	i	was	a	kid	.
 may 	 be 	 	that	's	where	the	whole	inspiration	thing	 start 	 ed 	 	from	,	 puppet 	 s 	 	,	right	.
and	then	 perform 	 ing 	 	 art 	 s 	 	high	school	.
there	i	was	in	high	school	,	 meet 	 ing 	 	 danc 	 ers 	 	and	 act 	 ing 	 	.
and	 some 	 how 	 	,	from	there	,	i	got	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	design	.
i	went	to	parsons	school	of	design	and	then	i	 beg 	 an 	 	my	 care 	 er 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 design 	 er 	 	.
i	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	think	of	 my 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 design 	 er 	 	,	i	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	think	of	 my 	 self 	 	 necess 	 arily 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	fashion	 design 	 er 	 	.
and	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	i	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	know	what	to	call	 my 	 self 	 	.
i	think	of	 my 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	...	i	do	n't	know	what	i	think	of	 my 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	.
it	's	just	that	.
but	i	must	say	,	 th 	 is 	 	whole	thing	about	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 bor 	 ed 	 	all	the	time	,	that	is	what	--	i	think	that	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	for	a	fashion	 design 	 er 	 	.
you	 al 	 ways 	 	have	to	be	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 bor 	 ed 	 	with	 every 	 thing 	 	.
and	if	you	're	not	,	you	have	to	pretend	to	be	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 bor 	 ed 	 	with	 every 	 thing 	 	.
but	i	am	 re 	 ally 	 	a	little	 bor 	 ed 	 	with	 every 	 thing 	 	.
i	 al 	 ways 	 	say	to	my	partner	,	marisa	gardini	,	who	 book 	 s 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	--	she	 book 	 s 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	and	she	 make 	 s 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	happen	.
and	she	 make 	 s 	 	all	the	 deal 	 s 	 	.
and	i	 al 	 ways 	 	tell	her	that	i	find	 my 	 self 	 	with	a	lot	of	time	on	the	computer	bridge	program	.
too	much	time	on	computer	bridge	,	which	is	,	you	know	,	like	that	's	so	...	 some 	 how 	 	,	like	,	about	ten	 year 	 s 	 	ago	i	thought	that	the	most	 un 	 bor 	 ing 	 	place	in	the	world	would	be	like	a	t.v	.	studio	,	like	for	a	day	show	.	some	kind	of	day	talk	show	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	all	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	love	all	kind	of	in	one	place	.
and	if	you	ever	get	 bor 	 ed 	 	you	can	look	at	 an 	 other 	 	thing	,	and	do	 an 	 other 	 	thing	and	talk	about	it	,	right	?
and	so	i	had	 th 	 is 	 	t.v	.	show	.
and	that	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	big	part	of	my	process	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	could	you	roll	the	clip	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	?

im	:	are	you	 freak 	 ing 	 	out	?	you	look	so	cute	.

im	:	oh	,	it	's	so	fabulous	!
rod	:	flock	of	rosie	.	wooo	!
im	:	so	by	the	way	.	of	all	the	most	 un 	 bor 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	in	the	world	,	right	.
i	mean	,	like	making	 some 	 one 	 	who	's	 al 	 ready 	 	cute	look	 terr 	 ible 	 	like	that	.
that	is	not	 bor 	 ing 	 	.	that	is	 noth 	 ing 	 	if	it	's	not	 bor 	 ing 	 	.	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	read	 th 	 is 	 	great	quote	the	other	day	,	which	was	,	``	style	 make 	 s 	 	you	feel	great	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 take 	 s 	 	your	mind	off	the	fact	that	you	're	going	to	die	.	``	right	?	and	then	i	 real 	 ized 	 	,	that	was	on	my	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	and	then	it	 s 	 aid 	 	,	like	,	you	know	,	the	quote	was	 attribut 	 ed 	 	to	me	and	i	thought	,	oh	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	,	you	know	,	in	an	interview	.
i	 for 	 got 	 	that	i	 s 	 aid 	 	that	.	but	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	true	.
i	want	to	show	you	 th 	 is 	 	last	clip	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	going	to	be	my	last	 good 	 bye 	 	.	i	'll	tell	you	that	i	cook	a	lot	 al 	 so 	 	.	i	love	to	cook	.
and	i	often	look	at	 thing 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	they	're	food	.
like	i	say	,	oh	,	you	know	,	would	you	serve	a	 rot 	 ten 	 	chicken	?
then	how	could	you	serve	,	you	know	,	a	beat	up	old	dress	or	 some 	 thing 	 	.
how	could	you	show	a	beat	up	old	dress	?
i	 al 	 ways 	 	 re 	 late 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	to	kitchen	-	ry	.
and	so	i	think	that	's	what	it	all	 boil 	 s 	 	down	to	.
 every 	 thing 	 	 boil 	 s 	 	down	to	that	.
so	check	 th 	 is 	 	out	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	it	's	the	most	 f 	 un 	 	thing	in	the	world	.
it	's	,	like	,	 th 	 is 	 	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
it	's	got	a	lot	of	different	 thing 	 s 	 	on	it	.
it	's	a	 poly 	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
we	 actual 	 ly 	 	shoot	 segment 	 s 	 	like	t.v	.	show	 segment 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	kind	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	thing	in	the	world	.
and	it	just	 beg 	 an 	 	like	in	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	february	.	so	who	 know 	 s 	 	?
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	i	do	n't	say	it	's	good	,	i	just	think	it	's	not	 bor 	 ing 	 	,	right	?
and	here	is	the	last	bit	.
im	:	i	have	to	tell	you	,	i	make	 butter 	 milk 	 	 pan 	 cake 	 s 	 	or	 butter 	 milk 	 	 wa 	 ff 	 les 	 	all	the	time	.
chef	:	do	you	?
im	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	but	i	can	never	find	 butter 	 milk 	 	,	ever	.
chef	:	oh	.
im	:	you	ca	n't	find	 butter 	 milk 	 	at	citarella	;	you	ca	n't	find	 butter 	 milk 	 	.
chef	:	you	ca	n't	?
im	:	it	's	 al 	 ways 	 	low	-	fat	 butter 	 milk 	 	.
chef	:	no	,	but	that	's	all	it	is	.
im	:	is	that	all	it	is	?
chef	:	oh	,	you	do	n't	know	?	let	me	tell	you	 some 	 thing 	 	.
let	me	tell	you	 some 	 thing 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
im	:	you	know	what	?	stop	 laugh 	 ing 	 	.	it	's	not	funny	.
just	 be 	 cause 	 	i	do	n't	know	that	whole	--	that	there	's	no	 s 	 uch 	 	thing	 a 	 s 	 	whole	 butter 	 milk 	 	.
sorry	,	what	?
chef	:	well	,	here	's	the	deal	.	let	me	tell	you	the	deal	.
in	the	old	 day 	 s 	 	when	they	used	to	make	butter	,	you	know	how	you	make	butter	?
im	:	churns	?
chef	:	for	cream	?
im	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	 exact 	 ly 	 	.
chef	:	so	you	take	heavy	,	high	-	fat	milk	,	which	is	cream	,	and	you	churn	it	 un 	 til 	 	it	 separat 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	these	 cur 	 d 	 s 	 	and	water	.
the	liquid	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	that	clear	liquid	.	if	you	've	ever	 over 	 beat 	 en 	 	your	 whip 	 ped 	 	cream	,	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 butter 	 milk 	 	.
and	that	's	what	it	was	in	the	early	 day 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	what	people	used	for	 ba 	 king 	 	and	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
now	,	the	 butter 	 milk 	 	that	you	get	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	low	-	fat	or	skim	milk	.
im	:	excuse	me	,	i	did	n't	know	.	all	right	?
chef	:	the	reason	he	thought	that	is	 be 	 cause 	 	 butter 	 milk 	 	is	so	 wonder 	 fully 	 	thick	and	 delic 	 ious 	 	.
im	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	it	is	,	 exact 	 ly 	 	.
so	who	would	think	that	it	was	low	-	fat	?
well	,	that	's	it	.	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
