what	i	am	 al 	 ways 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	is	what	 th 	 is 	 	session	is	about	,	which	is	 call 	 ed 	 	 simpl 	 icity 	 	.
and	 al 	 most 	 	,	i	would	 al 	 most 	 	call	it	 be 	 ing 	 	simple	-	minded	,	but	in	the	best	sense	of	the	word	.
i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	two	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 thing 	 s 	 	:	how	to	live	and	how	to	die	,	period	.
that	's	all	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	,	all	day	long	.
and	i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	have	some	 meal 	 s 	 	,	and	have	some	 snack 	 s 	 	,	and	,	you	know	,	and	yell	at	my	children	,	and	do	all	the	normal	 thing 	 s 	 	that	keep	you	 ground 	 ed 	 	.
so	,	i	was	fortunate	 en 	 ough 	 	to	be	born	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 dream 	 y 	 	child	.
my	 old 	 er 	 	sister	was	 bus 	 y 	 	 tor 	 tur 	 ing 	 	my	 parent 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 bus 	 y 	 	 tor 	 tur 	 ing 	 	her	.
i	was	 luck 	 y 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	to	be	 complete 	 ly 	 	 ignor 	 ed 	 	,	which	is	a	fabulous	thing	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	want	to	tell	you	.
so	,	i	was	able	to	 complete 	 ly 	 	 day 	 dream 	 	my	way	through	my	life	.	and	i	 final 	 ly 	 	 day 	 dream 	 ed 	 	my	way	 in 	 to 	 	nyu	,	at	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	time	,	in	1967	,	where	i	met	a	man	who	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	blow	up	the	math	building	of	nyu	.	and	i	was	writing	 terr 	 ible 	 	 poet 	 ry 	 	and	 knit 	 ting 	 	 sweat 	 ers 	 	for	him	.
and	 feminist 	 s 	 	 hat 	 ed 	 	us	,	and	the	whole	thing	was	 wr 	 etch 	 ed 	 	from	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	end	.
but	i	 ke 	 pt 	 	writing	bad	 poet 	 ry 	 	,	and	he	did	n't	blow	up	the	math	building	,	but	he	went	to	cuba	.
but	i	 g 	 ave 	 	him	the	money	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	from	riverdale	so	i	had	more	money	than	he	did	.
and	that	was	a	good	thing	to	help	,	you	know	,	the	cause	.
but	,	then	he	came	back	,	and	 thing 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	and	i	 decide 	 d 	 	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 hat 	 ed 	 	my	writing	,	that	it	was	awful	,	awful	,	 pur 	 ple 	 	 pro 	 s 	 e 	 	.
and	i	 decide 	 d 	 	that	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	tell	--	but	i	still	 want 	 ed 	 	to	tell	a	narrative	story	and	i	still	 want 	 ed 	 	to	tell	my	 st 	 ories 	 	.
so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	that	i	would	start	to	draw	.	how	hard	could	that	be	?
and	so	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	was	that	i	 start 	 ed 	 	just	 be 	 coming 	 	an	 editor 	 ial 	 	 illustr 	 ator 	 	through	,	you	know	,	 she 	 er 	 	 what 	 ever 	 	,	 she 	 er 	 	 ignor 	 ance 	 	.
and	we	 start 	 ed 	 	a	studio	.	well	,	tibor	 re 	 ally 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	the	studio	,	 call 	 ed 	 	m	&	co	.
and	the	 pre 	 mise 	 	of	m	&	co	was	,	we	do	n't	know	 any 	 thing 	 	,	but	that	's	all	right	,	we	're	going	to	do	it	 any 	 way 	 	.	and	 a 	 s 	 	a	matter	of	fact	,	it	's	better	not	to	know	 any 	 thing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	know	too	much	,	you	're	 s 	 ty 	 mi 	 ed 	 	.
so	,	the	 pre 	 mise 	 	in	the	studio	was	,	there	are	no	 bound 	 aries 	 	,	there	is	no	fear	.
and	i	--	and	my	full	-	time	job	,	i	 land 	 ed 	 	the	best	job	on	earth	,	was	to	 day 	 dream 	 	,	and	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	come	up	with	absurd	 idea 	 s 	 	that	--	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	people	there	,	and	it	was	a	team	,	it	was	a	 collect 	 ive 	 	,	it	was	not	just	me	coming	up	with	crazy	 idea 	 s 	 	.
but	the	point	was	that	i	was	there	 a 	 s 	 	 my 	 self 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 dream 	 er 	 	.
and	so	some	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	--	i	mean	,	it	was	a	long	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	m	&	co	,	and	 clear 	 ly 	 	we	 al 	 so 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	to	make	some	money	,	so	we	 decide 	 d 	 	we	would	create	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 product 	 s 	 	.
and	some	of	the	 watch 	 es 	 	there	,	 attempt 	 ing 	 	to	be	 beaut 	 iful 	 	and	 humor 	 ous 	 	--	 may 	 be 	 	not	 attempt 	 ing 	 	,	 hope 	 fully 	 	 succeed 	 ing 	 	.	that	to	be	able	to	talk	about	content	,	to	break	 a 	 part 	 	what	you	 normal 	 ly 	 	expect	,	to	use	humor	and	surprise	,	 e 	 leg 	 ance 	 	and	 human 	 ity 	 	in	your	work	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	us	.
it	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	high	,	it	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 imperson 	 al 	 	time	in	design	and	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	say	,	the	content	is	what	's	 import 	 ant 	 	,	not	the	package	,	not	the	 wrap 	 ping 	 	.
you	 re 	 ally 	 	have	to	be	 journalist 	 s 	 	,	you	have	to	be	 inventor 	 s 	 	,	you	have	to	use	your	 imagin 	 ation 	 	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	than	 any 	 thing 	 	.
so	,	the	good	news	is	that	i	have	a	dog	and	,	 th 	 ough 	 	i	do	n't	know	if	i	 believ 	 e 	 	in	luck	--	i	do	n't	know	what	i	 believ 	 e 	 	in	,	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	question	,	but	i	do	know	that	before	i	go	away	,	i	crank	his	tail	seven	 time 	 s 	 	.
so	,	 when 	 ever 	 	he	 s 	 ees 	 	a	 suit 	 case 	 	in	the	house	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 every 	 body 	 	's	 al 	 ways 	 	,	you	know	,	 leav 	 ing 	 	,	they	're	 al 	 ways 	 	 crank 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	dog	's	tail	,	and	he	 run 	 s 	 	to	the	other	room	.
but	i	am	able	to	make	the	 transit 	 ion 	 	from	 work 	 ing 	 	for	children	and	--	from	 work 	 ing 	 	for	 adult 	 s 	 	to	children	,	and	back	and	forth	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	you	know	,	i	can	say	that	i	'm	 im 	 mature 	 	,	and	in	a	way	,	that	's	true	.
i	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	--	i	mean	,	i	could	tell	you	that	i	did	n't	understand	,	i	'm	not	proud	of	it	,	but	i	did	n't	understand	let	's	say	95	percent	of	the	 talk 	 s 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	.
but	i	have	 be 	 en 	 	taking	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 note 	 s 	 	of	 draw 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	i	have	a	 gorge 	 ous 	 	 on 	 ion 	 	from	murray	gell	-	mann	's	talk	.
and	i	have	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	page	of	 doodle 	 s 	 	from	jonathan	woodham	's	talk	.
so	,	good	 thing 	 s 	 	come	out	of	,	you	know	,	 in 	 comprehens 	 ion 	 	--	--	which	i	will	do	a	 paint 	 ing 	 	of	,	and	then	it	will	end	up	in	my	work	.
so	,	i	'm	open	to	the	 possibil 	 ities 	 	of	not	 know 	 ing 	 	and	 find 	 ing 	 	out	 some 	 thing 	 	new	.
so	,	in	writing	for	children	,	it	 seem 	 s 	 	simple	,	and	it	is	.
you	have	to	 condens 	 e 	 	a	story	 in 	 to 	 	32	 page 	 s 	 	,	 usual 	 ly 	 	.
and	what	you	have	to	do	is	,	you	 re 	 ally 	 	have	to	edit	down	to	what	you	want	to	say	.	and	 hope 	 fully 	 	,	you	're	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	down	to	 kid 	 s 	 	and	you	're	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	in	 s 	 uch 	 	a	way	that	you	,	you	know	,	could	n't	stand	 read 	 ing 	 	it	after	one	time	.
so	,	i	 hope 	 fully 	 	am	writing	,	you	know	,	 book 	 s 	 	that	are	good	for	children	and	for	 adult 	 s 	 	.
but	the	 paint 	 ing 	 	 reflect 	 s 	 	--	i	do	n't	think	 different 	 ly 	 	for	children	than	i	do	for	 adult 	 s 	 	.
i	try	to	use	the	same	kind	of	 imagin 	 ation 	 	,	the	same	kind	of	 whim 	 s 	 y 	 	,	the	same	kind	of	love	of	language	.
so	,	you	know	,	and	i	have	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 wonder 	 ful 	 	-	looking	 friend 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	andrew	gatz	,	and	he	 walk 	 ed 	 	in	through	the	door	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	!	 s 	 it 	 	down	there	.	``	you	know	,	i	take	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 photo 	 s 	 	.
and	the	bertoia	chair	in	the	 back 	 ground 	 	is	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	chair	.
so	,	i	get	to	put	in	all	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	love	.	 hope 	 fully 	 	,	a	 dia 	 log 	 	between	 adult 	 s 	 	and	children	will	happen	on	 man 	 y 	 	different	 level 	 s 	 	,	and	 hope 	 fully 	 	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	humor	will	evolve	.
and	the	 book 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 journal 	 s 	 	of	my	life	.
i	never	--	i	do	n't	like	 plot 	 s 	 	.
i	do	n't	know	what	a	plot	 mean 	 s 	 	.
i	ca	n't	stand	the	idea	of	 any 	 thing 	 	that	 start 	 s 	 	in	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	you	know	,	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	middle	and	end	.	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 care 	 s 	 	me	,	 be 	 cause 	 	my	life	is	too	random	and	too	 con 	 fused 	 	,	and	i	enjoy	it	that	way	.
but	 any 	 way 	 	,	so	we	 we 	 re 	 	in	venice	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	our	room	.	and	i	had	 th 	 is 	 	dream	that	i	was	 wear 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	fantastic	green	gown	,	and	i	was	looking	out	the	window	,	and	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	thing	.
and	so	,	i	was	able	to	put	that	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	story	,	which	is	an	 alpha 	 bet 	 	,	and	 hope 	 fully 	 	go	on	to	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
the	letter	c	had	other	 thing 	 s 	 	in	it	.
i	was	fortunate	 al 	 so 	 	,	to	meet	the	man	who	's	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	on	the	bed	,	 th 	 ough 	 	i	 g 	 ave 	 	him	hair	over	here	and	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	hair	.	well	,	he	 ha 	 s 	 	some	hair	but	--	well	,	he	used	to	have	hair	.
and	with	him	,	i	was	able	to	do	a	project	that	was	 re 	 ally 	 	fantastic	.
i	work	for	the	new	yorker	,	and	i	do	 cover 	 s 	 	,	and	9/11	 happen 	 ed 	 	and	it	was	,	you	know	,	a	complete	and	utter	end	of	the	world	 a 	 s 	 	we	 k 	 new 	 	it	.
and	rick	and	i	 we 	 re 	 	on	our	way	to	a	party	in	the	bronx	,	and	 some 	 body 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	bronxistan	,	and	 some 	 body 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	ferreristan	,	and	we	came	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	new	yorker	cover	,	which	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	--	we	did	n't	know	what	we	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	.	we	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 try 	 ing 	 	to	be	funny	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 try 	 ing 	 	to	be	--	well	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	be	funny	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	that	's	not	true	.
we	 hop 	 ed 	 	we	'd	be	funny	,	but	we	did	n't	know	it	would	be	a	cover	,	and	we	did	n't	know	that	that	image	,	at	the	moment	that	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	would	be	 some 	 thing 	 	that	would	be	so	 wonder 	 ful 	 	for	a	lot	of	people	.
and	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 be 	 came 	 	the	--	i	do	n't	know	,	you	know	,	it	was	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 moment 	 s 	 	people	 start 	 ed 	 	 laugh 	 ing 	 	at	what	was	going	on	.
and	from	,	you	know	,	fattushis	,	to	taxistan	to	,	you	know	,	for	the	fashtoonks	,	botoxia	,	pashmina	,	khlintunisia	,	you	know	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	take	the	city	and	make	 f 	 un 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	foreign	,	who	are	--	what	's	going	on	over	here	?
who	are	these	people	?	what	are	these	 tribe 	 s 	 	?
and	david	remnick	,	who	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	about	it	,	had	one	problem	.	he	did	n't	like	al	zheimers	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	thought	it	would	insult	people	with	alzheimer	's	.
but	you	know	,	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	david	,	who	's	going	to	know	?
they	're	not	.	``
so	it	 stay 	 ed 	 	in	,	and	it	was	,	and	,	you	know	,	it	was	a	good	thing	.
you	know	,	in	the	course	of	my	life	,	i	never	know	what	's	going	to	happen	and	that	's	kind	of	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	part	.
and	we	 we 	 re 	 	on	cape	cod	,	a	place	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	of	great	inspiration	,	and	i	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	 th 	 is 	 	book	,	``	the	 element 	 s 	 	of	style	,	``	at	a	yard	sale	.	and	i	did	n't	--	and	i	'd	never	used	it	in	school	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	too	 bus 	 y 	 	writing	 poem 	 s 	 	,	and	 flu 	 nk 	 ing 	 	out	,	and	i	do	n't	know	what	,	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	 cafe 	 s 	 	.
but	i	 pick 	 ed 	 	it	up	and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 read 	 ing 	 	it	and	i	thought	,	 th 	 is 	 	book	is	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	people	should	know	about	 th 	 is 	 	book	.
so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	it	 need 	 ed 	 	a	few	--	it	 need 	 ed 	 	a	lift	,	it	 need 	 ed 	 	a	few	 illustr 	 ations 	 	.
and	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	i	 call 	 ed 	 	the	,	you	know	,	i	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	the	white	 e 	 state 	 	,	and	what	an	 intersect 	 ion 	 	of	like	,	you	know	,	polish	jew	,	you	know	,	main	wasp	family	.	here	i	am	,	 say 	 ing 	 	,	i	'd	like	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	book	.
and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	 y 	 es 	 	,	and	they	left	me	 complete 	 ly 	 	 al 	 one 	 	,	which	was	a	 gorge 	 ous 	 	,	 wonder 	 ful 	 	thing	.
and	i	took	the	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	that	they	 g 	 ave 	 	,	and	just	did	56	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	i	do	n't	know	if	you	can	read	 th 	 is 	 	.
``	well	,	susan	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	fine	mess	you	are	in	.	``	and	when	you	're	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	 gram 	 mar 	 	,	which	is	,	you	know	,	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	dry	,	e.b	.	white	wrote	 s 	 uch 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	,	 whim 	 s 	 ical 	 	--	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	strunk	--	and	then	you	come	to	the	 rule 	 s 	 	and	,	you	know	,	there	are	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 gram 	 mar 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.	``	do	you	mind	me	 ask 	 ing 	 	a	question	?
