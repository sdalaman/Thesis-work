i	was	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	a	position	 a 	 s 	 	associate	professor	of	medicine	and	chief	of	scientific	 visual 	 ization 	 	at	yale	university	in	the	 depart 	 ment 	 	of	medicine	.
and	my	job	was	to	write	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 algorithm 	 s 	 	and	code	for	nasa	to	do	virtual	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	in	 pre 	 par 	 ation 	 	for	the	 astro 	 nauts 	 	going	 in 	 to 	 	deep	 space 	 flight 	 	,	so	they	could	be	 ke 	 pt 	 	in	robotic	pods	.
one	of	the	 fasci 	 nating 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	about	what	we	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	is	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	,	using	new	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 s 	 canning 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	that	had	just	never	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 een 	 	before	--	i	mean	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	in	disease	management	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 allow 	 ed 	 	us	to	see	 thing 	 s 	 	about	the	body	that	just	made	you	marvel	.
i	remember	one	of	the	first	 time 	 s 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	looking	at	 collage 	 n 	 	.
and	your	entire	body	,	 every 	 thing 	 	--	your	hair	,	skin	,	bone	,	 nail 	 s 	 	--	 every 	 thing 	 	is	made	of	 collage 	 n 	 	.
and	it	's	a	kind	of	rope	-	like	structure	that	 twirl 	 s 	 	and	 swirl 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	the	 on 	 ly 	 	place	that	 collage 	 n 	 	 change 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	structure	is	in	the	 corn 	 e 	 a 	 	of	your	eye	.
in	your	eye	,	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	grid	 form 	 ation 	 	,	and	 there 	 fore 	 	,	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 trans 	 parent 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	 opa 	 que 	 	.
so	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 organize 	 d 	 	a	structure	,	it	was	hard	not	to	 attribut 	 e 	 	 div 	 in 	 ity 	 	to	it	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	 ke 	 pt 	 	on	 see 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	over	and	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	in	different	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	body	.
one	of	the	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	i	had	was	one	person	was	 work 	 ing 	 	on	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 micro 	 magnet 	 ic 	 	 reson 	 ance 	 	 im 	 aging 	 	machine	with	the	nih	.
and	what	we	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	do	was	 s 	 can 	 	a	new	project	on	the	 develop 	 ment 	 	of	the	fetus	from	conception	to	birth	using	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	new	 techno 	 logies 	 	.
so	i	wrote	the	 algorithm 	 s 	 	in	code	,	and	he	built	the	 hard 	 ware 	 	--	paul	lauterbur	--	then	went	onto	win	the	 no 	 bel 	 	prize	for	 invent 	 ing 	 	the	mri	.

i	'm	going	to	show	you	 some 	 thing 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	 un 	 ique 	 	.
here	's	a	human	heart	at	25	[	 week 	 s 	 	]	.
it	's	just	 bas 	 ically 	 	two	 strand 	 s 	 	.

 with 	 in 	 	five	 week 	 s 	 	,	you	can	start	to	see	the	early	 at 	 rium 	 	and	the	early	 ventricle 	 s 	 	.
six	 week 	 s 	 	,	these	 fold 	 s 	 	are	now	 begin 	 ning 	 	with	the	 pa 	 pill 	 a 	 	on	the	 in 	 side 	 	of	the	heart	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	pull	down	each	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 val 	 ves 	 	in	your	heart	 un 	 til 	 	you	get	a	mature	heart	--	and	then	 bas 	 ically 	 	the	 develop 	 ment 	 	of	the	entire	human	body	.
the	magic	of	the	 mechan 	 ism 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	each	genetic	structure	 say 	 ing 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	where	that	nerve	cell	should	go	--	the	 complex 	 ity 	 	of	these	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 model 	 s 	 	of	how	these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	 d 	 one 	 	are	beyond	human	 comprehens 	 ion 	 	.
even	 th 	 ough 	 	i	am	a	 mathematic 	 ian 	 	,	i	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	with	marvel	of	how	do	these	 instruct 	 ion 	 	 set 	 s 	 	not	make	these	 mistak 	 es 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	build	what	is	us	?
it	's	a	 myster 	 y 	 	,	it	's	magic	,	it	's	 div 	 in 	 ity 	 	.
then	you	start	to	take	a	look	at	adult	life	.
take	a	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	little	 tu 	 ft 	 	of	 cap 	 ill 	 aries 	 	.
it	's	just	a	 tin 	 y 	 	sub	-	 sub 	 structure 	 	,	 micro 	 scopic 	 	.
but	 bas 	 ically 	 	by	the	time	you	're	nine	 month 	 s 	 	and	you	're	 give 	 n 	 	birth	,	you	have	 al 	 most 	 	60,000	 mile 	 s 	 	of	 vessel 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	your	body	.
i	mean	,	and	 on 	 ly 	 	one	mile	is	visible	.
59,999	 mile 	 s 	 	that	are	 bas 	 ically 	 	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	 nutrient 	 s 	 	and	taking	waste	away	.
the	 complex 	 ity 	 	of	building	that	 with 	 in 	 	a	single	system	is	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	beyond	any	 comprehens 	 ion 	 	or	any	 exist 	 ing 	 	 mathematic 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	that	 instruct 	 ion 	 	set	,	from	the	brain	to	every	other	part	of	the	body	--	look	at	the	 complex 	 ity 	 	of	the	 fold 	 ing 	 	.
where	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 intellig 	 ence 	 	of	 know 	 ing 	 	that	a	fold	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	hold	more	information	,	so	 a 	 s 	 	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	watch	the	baby	's	brain	grow	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	right	now	.
we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	the	launch	of	two	new	 stud 	 ies 	 	of	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 canning 	 	 bab 	 ies 	 	'	 brain 	 s 	 	from	the	moment	they	're	born	.

and	it	's	not	just	our	own	 exist 	 ence 	 	,	but	how	 do 	 es 	 	the	woman	's	body	understand	to	have	genetic	structure	that	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 build 	 s 	 	her	own	,	but	then	 ha 	 s 	 	the	 understand 	 ing 	 	that	 allow 	 s 	 	her	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	 walk 	 ing 	 	 immuno 	 logical 	 	,	 cardio 	 vascular 	 	system	that	 bas 	 ically 	 	is	a	mobile	system	that	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	nurture	,	treat	 th 	 is 	 	child	with	a	kind	of	marvel	that	is	beyond	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	our	 comprehens 	 ion 	 	--	the	magic	that	is	 exist 	 ence 	 	,	that	is	us	?
