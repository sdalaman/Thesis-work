one	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	in	the	year	1957	,	the	 neuro 	 surgeon 	 	walter	penfield	saw	 him 	 self 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	a	weird	freak	with	huge	 hand 	 s 	 	,	huge	mouth	,	and	a	 tin 	 y 	 	bottom	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	creature	is	the	result	of	the	penfield	research	.
he	named	it	 hom 	 un 	 cul 	 us 	 	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	the	 hom 	 un 	 cul 	 us 	 	is	the	 visual 	 ization 	 	of	a	human	 be 	 ing 	 	where	each	part	of	the	body	is	 proportion 	 al 	 	to	the	surface	it	 take 	 s 	 	in	the	brain	.
so	,	of	course	,	 hom 	 un 	 cul 	 us 	 	is	 definite 	 ly 	 	not	a	freak	.
it	's	you	.	it	's	me	.
it	's	our	 in 	 visible 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 visual 	 ization 	 	could	explain	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	why	 new 	 born 	 s 	 	,	or	 smok 	 ers 	 	,	put	,	 instinct 	 ively 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 finger 	 s 	 	in	the	mouth	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	explain	why	so	 man 	 y 	 	 design 	 ers 	 	remain	 main 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 design 	 ing 	 	 chair 	 s 	 	.
so	 any 	 way 	 	,	even	if	i	do	not	understand	science	 entire 	 ly 	 	,	for	my	design	i	 essential 	 ly 	 	refer	to	it	.
i	'm	 fascinate 	 d 	 	by	 it 	 s 	 	ability	to	 deep 	 ly 	 	investigate	the	human	 be 	 ing 	 	,	 it 	 s 	 	way	of	 work 	 ing 	 	,	 it 	 s 	 	way	of	 feel 	 ing 	 	.
and	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 help 	 s 	 	me	to	understand	how	we	see	,	how	we	hear	,	how	we	breathe	,	how	our	brain	can	inform	or	 mis 	 lead 	 	us	.
it	's	a	great	tool	for	me	to	understand	what	could	be	our	real	 need 	 s 	 	.
 market 	 ing 	 	people	have	never	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	do	that	.
 market 	 ing 	 	 reduc 	 es 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.	 market 	 ing 	 	 simpl 	 ifies 	 	.
 market 	 ing 	 	 create 	 s 	 	user	 group 	 s 	 	.
and	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 mid 	 st 	 	 complex 	 ity 	 	,	 a 	 mid 	 st 	 	 fluctu 	 ation 	 	and	 un 	 ique 	 ness 	 	.
what	could	be	our	real	 need 	 s 	 	?
 may 	 be 	 	the	silence	.
in	our	 dai 	 ly 	 	life	we	are	 continu 	 ously 	 	 disturb 	 ed 	 	by	 aggress 	 ive 	 	 sound 	 s 	 	.
and	you	know	all	 t 	 hose 	 	kind	of	sound	 put 	 s 	 	us	in	a	kind	of	 stress 	 ful 	 	state	,	and	prevent	us	from	 be 	 ing 	 	quiet	and	focused	.
so	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	create	a	kind	of	sound	filter	,	able	to	preserve	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	from	noise	 poll 	 ution 	 	.
but	i	did	n't	want	it	to	make	it	by	 isol 	 ating 	 	people	,	 with 	 out 	 	any	earmuffs	or	 t 	 hose 	 	kind	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
or	 n 	 either 	 	with	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	complex	technology	.
i	just	 want 	 ed 	 	to	,	using	the	 complex 	 ity 	 	and	the	technology	of	the	brain	,	of	the	human	brain	.
so	i	 work 	 ed 	 	with	white	noise	.
d.b	.	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	--
d.b	.	is	the	name	of	the	product	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	a	white	noise	 diffuse 	 r 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	white	noise	.
the	white	noise	is	the	sum	of	all	 fr 	 equ 	 encies 	 	that	are	audible	by	the	human	 be 	 ing 	 	,	 br 	 ought 	 	to	the	same	 intens 	 ity 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	noise	is	like	a	``	 sh 	 hhhh 	 hhhh 	 hhhh 	 	,	``	like	that	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	noise	is	the	most	neutral	.
it	is	the	perfect	sound	for	our	 ear 	 s 	 	and	our	brain	.
so	when	you	hear	 th 	 is 	 	sound	you	feel	like	a	kind	of	shelter	,	 preserve 	 d 	 	from	noise	 poll 	 ution 	 	.
and	when	you	hear	the	white	noise	,	your	brain	is	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	focused	on	it	.	and	do	not	be	 disturb 	 ed 	 	any	more	by	the	other	 aggress 	 ive 	 	sound	.
it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	magic	.
but	it	is	just	physiology	.	it	's	just	in	your	brain	.
and	in	mine	,	i	hope	.
so	in	order	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	white	noise	a	little	bit	active	and	 re 	 active 	 	,	i	create	a	ball	,	a	 roll 	 ing 	 	ball	able	to	 analyz 	 e 	 	and	find	where	 do 	 es 	 	 aggress 	 ive 	 	sound	come	from	,	and	roll	,	at	home	or	at	work	,	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 aggress 	 ive 	 	noise	,	and	 emit 	 s 	 	white	noise	in	order	to	 neutral 	 ize 	 	it	.
it	 work 	 s 	 	.
you	feel	the	effect	of	the	white	noise	?
it	's	too	in	silence	.
if	you	make	some	noise	you	can	feel	the	effect	.
so	even	if	 th 	 is 	 	object	,	even	if	 th 	 is 	 	product	 include 	 s 	 	some	technology	,	it	 include 	 s 	 	some	 speaker 	 s 	 	,	it	 include 	 s 	 	some	 micro 	 phone 	 s 	 	and	some	 electron 	 ic 	 	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	object	is	not	a	 ver 	 y 	 	smart	object	.
and	i	do	n't	want	to	make	a	 ver 	 y 	 	smart	object	.
i	do	n't	want	to	create	a	perfect	object	like	a	perfect	robot	.
i	want	to	create	an	object	like	you	and	me	.
so	,	 definite 	 ly 	 	not	perfect	.
so	imagine	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	you	are	at	home	.
a	loving	 disput 	 e 	 	with	your	girl	or	boyfriend	.
you	shout	.	you	say	,	``	 bl 	 ah 	 	 bl 	 ah 	 	 bl 	 ah 	 	,	 bl 	 ah 	 	 bl 	 ah 	 	 bl 	 ah 	 	.	who	is	 th 	 is 	 	guy	?	``
and	d.b	.	will	 prob 	 ably 	 	roll	 to 	 ward 	 	you	.
and	 turn 	 ing 	 	around	you	is	``	 sh 	 hhhh 	 hhhh 	 hhhh 	 	,	``	like	that	.
 definite 	 ly 	 	not	perfect	.	so	you	would	 prob 	 ably 	 	shut	it	,	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	same	kind	of	approach	,	i	designed	k	.
k	is	a	 day 	 light 	 	 receiv 	 er 	 	 transmit 	 ter 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	object	is	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	 dis 	 play 	 ed 	 	on	your	desk	,	or	on	your	piano	,	where	you	are	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	 s 	 pend 	 	most	of	your	time	in	the	day	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	object	will	be	able	to	know	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	 quant 	 ity 	 	of	light	you	 receiv 	 e 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	day	,	and	able	to	give	you	the	 quant 	 ity 	 	of	light	you	need	.
 th 	 is 	 	object	is	 complete 	 ly 	 	 cover 	 ed 	 	by	fiber	 optical 	 s 	 	.
and	the	idea	of	 t 	 hose 	 	fiber	 optical 	 s 	 	is	to	inform	the	object	,	for	 s 	 ure 	 	,	but	 create 	 s 	 	the	idea	of	an	eye	 sens 	 ibility 	 	of	the	object	.
i	want	,	by	 th 	 is 	 	design	feel	,	when	you	see	it	,	you	see	,	 instinct 	 ively 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	object	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	sensitive	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 re 	 active 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	object	 know 	 s 	 	,	better	than	you	and	 prob 	 ably 	 	before	you	,	what	you	 re 	 ally 	 	need	.
you	have	to	know	that	the	lack	of	 day 	 light 	 	can	 provok 	 e 	 	some	problem	of	energy	,	or	problem	of	 lib 	 ido 	 	.
so	,	a	huge	problem	.
most	of	the	 project 	 s 	 	i	work	on	--	i	live	in	 calib 	 ration 	 	with	 scientist 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	just	a	 design 	 er 	 	.	so	i	need	them	.
so	there	can	be	some	 biologist 	 s 	 	,	 psychiatrist 	 s 	 	,	 mathematic 	 ians 	 	,	and	so	on	.
and	i	submit	them	,	my	 intuit 	 ions 	 	,	my	 hypo 	 thesis 	 	,	my	first	 idea 	 s 	 	.
and	they	react	.	they	told	me	what	is	possible	,	what	is	 im 	 possible 	 	.
and	together	we	improve	the	original	 con 	 cept 	 	.
and	we	build	the	project	to	the	end	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	relationship	between	 design 	 er 	 	and	scientist	 start 	 ed 	 	when	i	was	at	school	.
early	in	my	 stud 	 ies 	 	i	was	a	guinea	pig	for	a	pharmaceutical	industry	.
and	the	 iron 	 y 	 	for	me	was	of	course	,	i	did	n't	do	that	for	the	sake	of	science	progress	.
i	just	do	that	to	make	money	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	project	,	or	 th 	 is 	 	experience	,	make	me	start	a	new	project	on	the	design	of	medicine	.
you	have	to	know	that	 to 	 day 	 	,	 rough 	 ly 	 	one	or	two	every	drug	 pill 	 s 	 	is	not	taken	 correct 	 ly 	 	.
so	even	if	the	active	 constit 	 uent 	 s 	 	in	 pharmaceutical 	 s 	 	made	constant	progress	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 chemist 	 ry 	 	,	target	of	 st 	 ability 	 	,	the	behavior	of	the	 patient 	 s 	 	 go 	 es 	 	more	and	more	 un 	 s 	 table 	 	.
so	we	took	too	 man 	 y 	 	of	them	.
we	took	 ir 	 regular 	 	 do 	 s 	 age 	 	.
we	do	not	follow	 instruct 	 ions 	 	.	and	so	on	.
so	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	create	a	new	kind	of	medicine	,	in	order	to	create	a	new	kind	of	relationship	between	the	patient	and	the	 treat 	 ment 	 	.
so	i	 turn 	 ed 	 	 tradition 	 al 	 	 pill 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	give	you	some	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	one	is	an	 anti 	 biotic 	 	.
and	 it 	 s 	 	purpose	is	to	help	patient	to	go	to	the	end	of	the	 treat 	 ment 	 	.
and	the	 con 	 cept 	 	is	to	create	a	kind	of	 on 	 ion 	 	,	a	kind	of	structure	in	 layer 	 s 	 	.
so	,	you	start	with	the	 dark 	 est 	 	one	.
and	you	are	 help 	 ed 	 	to	 visual 	 ize 	 	the	 dur 	 ation 	 	of	the	 treat 	 ment 	 	.
and	you	are	 help 	 ed 	 	to	 visual 	 ize 	 	the	 de 	 crease 	 	of	the	 infect 	 ion 	 	.
so	the	first	day	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	big	one	.
and	you	have	to	peel	and	eat	one	layer	a	day	.
and	your	 anti 	 biotic 	 	 go 	 es 	 	 small 	 er 	 	and	 clear 	 er 	 	.
and	you	're	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	 we 	 re 	 	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	the	christmas	day	.
and	you	follow	the	 treat 	 ment 	 	like	that	,	to	the	end	of	the	 treat 	 ment 	 	.
and	here	you	can	get	the	white	core	.
and	it	 mean 	 s 	 	,	right	,	you	are	in	the	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	.
thank	you	.
 th 	 is 	 	one	is	a	``	third	lung	,	``	a	pharmaceutical	 de 	 vice 	 	for	long	-	term	asthma	 treat 	 ment 	 
i	designed	to	help	 kid 	 s 	 	to	follow	the	 treat 	 ment 	 	.
so	the	idea	of	 th 	 is 	 	one	is	to	create	a	relationship	between	the	patient	of	the	 treat 	 ment 	 	but	a	relationship	of	 depend 	 ency 	 	.
but	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	it	is	not	the	 medic 	 ation 	 	that	is	dependent	on	the	patient	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	,	the	 kid 	 s 	 	will	feel	the	therapeutic	object	 need 	 s 	 	him	.
so	the	idea	is	,	all	night	long	the	elastic	skin	of	the	third	lung	will	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	 infla 	 te 	 	 it 	 self 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	air	and	 molecule 	 s 	 	,	for	 s 	 ure 	 	.
and	when	the	 kid 	 s 	 	wake	up	,	he	can	see	the	object	 need 	 s 	 	him	.	and	he	take	him	to	his	mouth	,	and	breathe	the	air	it	 contain 	 s 	 	.
so	by	 th 	 is 	 	way	,	the	kid	,	to	take	care	of	 him 	 self 	 	,	is	to	take	care	of	 th 	 is 	 	living	object	.
and	he	 do 	 es 	 	not	feel	 any 	 more 	 	it	's	 re 	 lies 	 	on	asthma	 treat 	 ment 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	asthma	 treat 	 ment 	 	 need 	 s 	 	him	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	guise	of	living	object	approach	,	i	like	the	idea	of	a	kind	of	 in 	 visible 	 	design	,
 a 	 s 	 	if	the	function	of	the	object	 exist 	 s 	 	in	a	kind	of	 in 	 visible 	 	field	just	around	the	 object 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
we	could	talk	about	a	kind	of	soul	,	of	a	ghost	 compel 	 ling 	 	them	.
and	 al 	 most 	 	a	kind	of	 polterge 	 ist 	 	effect	.
so	when	a	 pass 	 ive 	 	object	like	 th 	 is 	 	one	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	 al 	 ive 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	 start 	 ing 	 	to	move	.
and	i	remember	an	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	design	i	made	for	john	maeda	,	and	for	the	 found 	 ation 	 	cartier	in	paris	.
and	john	maeda	was	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	show	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	graphic	 anim 	 ations 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	.
and	my	idea	for	 th 	 is 	 	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	design	was	to	create	a	real	pong	game	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
and	the	idea	was	to	create	some	self	-	moving	 bench 	 es 	 	in	the	main	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	room	.
so	the	living	 bench 	 es 	 	would	be	 exact 	 ly 	 	like	the	ball	.
and	john	was	so	 excit 	 ed 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	idea	.	he	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	let	's	go	.	``
i	remember	the	day	of	the	 open 	 ing 	 	.
i	was	a	little	bit	late	.
when	i	 br 	 ing 	 	the	10	living	and	self	-	moving	 bench 	 es 	 	in	the	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	room	,	john	was	just	 be 	 side 	 	me	,	and	was	like	,	``	hmm	.	hmm	.	``
and	he	told	me	,	after	a	long	silence	,	``	i	wonder	,	mathieu	,	if	people	wo	n't	be	more	 fascinate 	 d 	 	by	your	 bench 	 es 	 	than	by	my	 video 	 s 	 	.	``
it	would	be	a	great	honor	,	a	great	compliment	for	me	,	if	he	had	n't	 decide 	 d 	 	to	take	all	them	off	two	 hour 	 s 	 	before	the	 open 	 ing 	 	.
so	,	huge	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	.
i	guess	you	wo	n't	be	 surprise 	 d 	 	if	i	tell	you	that	pinocchio	is	one	of	my	great	 influence 	 s 	 	.
pinocchio	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	one	of	my	best	design	 product 	 s 	 	,	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	one	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	a	kind	of	object	with	a	 con 	 science 	 	,	able	to	be	 modifi 	 ed 	 	by	 it 	 s 	 	 surround 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	and	able	to	modify	it	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
the	other	great	influence	is	the	mine	's	 can 	 ary 	 	.
in	coal	 mine 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 can 	 ary 	 	was	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	close	to	the	 min 	 ers 	 	.
and	it	was	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	all	day	long	.	and	when	it	 stop 	 s 	 	it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	it	just	 di 	 ed 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 can 	 ary 	 	was	a	living	alarm	,	and	a	 ver 	 y 	 	efficient	one	.
a	 ver 	 y 	 	natural	technology	,	in	order	to	say	to	the	 min 	 ers 	 	,	``	the	air	is	too	bad	.	you	have	to	go	.	it	's	an	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	.	``
so	it	's	,	for	me	,	a	great	product	.
and	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	design	a	kind	of	 can 	 ary 	 	.
andrea	is	one	.
andrea	is	a	living	air	filter	that	 absorb 	 s 	 	toxic	 gas 	 s 	 es 	 	from	air	,	 contami 	 nated 	 	 in 	 door 	 	air	.
so	it	uses	some	 plant 	 s 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	job	,	 select 	 ed 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	gas	-	 filter 	 ing 	 	ability	.
you	have	to	know	,	or	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	know	,	that	 in 	 door 	 	air	 poll 	 ution 	 	is	more	toxic	than	 out 	 door 	 	one	.
so	while	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	you	,	the	 seat 	 s 	 	you	are	 s 	 it 	 	on	are	 current 	 ly 	 	 emit 	 ting 	 	some	 in 	 visible 	 	and	 odor 	 less 	 	toxic	gas	.	sorry	for	that	.
so	you	are	 current 	 ly 	 	 breath 	 ing 	 	 form 	 aldehyde 	 	.
it	's	the	same	for	me	with	the	carpet	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	at	home	.
 be 	 cause 	 	all	the	product	we	get	 constant 	 ly 	 	give	away	the	 volatil 	 e 	 	component	of	which	they	're	made	of	.
so	let	's	have	a	look	at	your	home	.
so	your	 s 	 of 	 a 	 	,	your	plastic	chair	,	your	kid	's	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	give	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 in 	 visible 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	one	is	 ver 	 y 	 	toxic	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	reason	why	i	 create 	 d 	 	,	with	david	edward	,	a	scientist	of	harvard	university	,	an	object	able	to	absorb	the	toxic	 element 	 s 	 	using	 t 	 hose 	 	kind	of	 plant 	 s 	 	.
but	the	idea	is	to	force	the	air	to	go	in	the	effective	part	of	the	 plant 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	 root 	 s 	 	of	the	plant	are	not	 ver 	 y 	 	effective	.
bill	wolverton	from	nasa	 analyz 	 ed 	 	it	 clever 	 ly 	 	in	the	'70s	.
so	the	idea	is	to	create	an	object	able	to	force	the	air	,	and	to	be	in	contact	at	the	right	speed	at	the	right	place	,	in	all	the	effective	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	plant	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	final	object	.
it	will	be	 launch 	 ed 	 	next	september	.
 th 	 is 	 	one	is	kind	of	the	same	approach	 be 	 cause 	 	i	include	,	in	a	product	like	andrea	,	some	 plant 	 s 	 	.
and	in	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	 plant 	 s 	 	are	used	for	the	water	filtration	ability	.
and	it	 include 	 s 	 	some	 fish 	 es 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
but	here	,	 un 	 like 	 	andrea	,	here	are	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	eaten	.
 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	object	is	a	domestic	farm	,	for	 fish 	 es 	 	and	green	.
so	the	idea	of	 th 	 is 	 	object	is	to	be	able	to	get	at	home	 ver 	 y 	 	local	food	.
the	 locavore 	 s 	 	used	to	get	food	taken	in	a	 radi 	 us 	 	of	100	 mile 	 s 	 	.
local	river	is	able	to	provide	you	food	 direct 	 ly 	 	in	your	living	room	.
so	the	principle	of	 th 	 is 	 	object	is	to	create	an	 eco 	 system 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 aquaponic 	 s 	 	.
and	the	 aquaponic 	 s 	 	is	the	 dirt 	 y 	 	water	of	the	fish	,	by	a	water	pump	,	 feed 	 s 	 	the	 plant 	 s 	 	above	.
and	the	 plant 	 s 	 	will	filter	,	by	the	 root 	 s 	 	,	the	 dirt 	 y 	 	water	of	the	fish	.	after	,	it	 go 	 es 	 	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	fish	tank	.
after	that	you	have	two	 option 	 s 	 	.
or	you	 s 	 it 	 	down	in	front	of	it	like	you	would	do	in	front	your	tv	set	.
 amaz 	 ing 	 	channel	.
or	you	start	 fish 	 ing 	 	.
and	you	make	some	 sushi 	 s 	 	with	a	fish	and	the	 aroma 	 tic 	 	 plant 	 s 	 	above	.
 be 	 cause 	 	you	can	grow	some	 potato 	 es 	 	.
no	,	not	 potato 	 es 	 	,	but	 tomato 	 es 	 	,	 aroma 	 tic 	 	 plant 	 s 	 	and	so	on	.
so	now	we	can	breathe	 safe 	 ly 	 	.
now	we	can	eat	local	food	.
now	we	can	be	 treat 	 ed 	 	by	smart	medicine	.
now	we	can	be	well	-	 balanc 	 ed 	 	in	our	 bio 	 rhythm 	 	with	 day 	 light 	 	.
but	it	was	 import 	 ant 	 	to	create	a	perfect	place	,	so	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	,	in	order	to	work	and	create	.
so	i	designed	,	for	an	american	scientist	based	in	paris	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 stimul 	 ative 	 	,	brain	-	 stimul 	 ative 	 	 off 	 ice 	 	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	create	a	perfect	place	where	you	can	work	and	play	,	and	where	your	body	and	your	brain	can	work	together	.
so	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	 off 	 ice 	 	,	you	do	not	work	 any 	 more 	 	at	your	desk	,	like	a	 politic 	 ian 	 	.
your	seat	,	your	sleep	and	your	play	on	a	big	 geo 	 de 	 s 	 ic 	 	 is 	 land 	 	made	of	leather	.
see	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	one	?
in	 th 	 is 	 	 off 	 ice 	 	you	do	not	work	and	write	and	draw	on	a	sheet	of	paper	,	but	you	draw	 direct 	 ly 	 	on	a	kind	of	huge	 white 	 board 	 	cave	,	like	a	 pre 	 historic 	 	scientist	.
so	you	,	like	that	,	can	make	some	 s 	 port 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	your	work	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	 off 	 ice 	 	you	do	not	need	to	go	out	in	order	to	be	in	contact	with	nature	.
you	include	,	 direct 	 ly 	 	,	the	nature	in	the	floor	of	the	 off 	 ice 	 	.	you	can	see	it	there	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	inspiration	image	to	lead	 th 	 is 	 	project	of	the	 off 	 ice 	 	.
it	 re 	 ally 	 	 help 	 ed 	 	me	to	design	it	.
i	never	show	it	to	my	client	.	he	would	be	so	 af 	 raid 	 	.	just	for	my	 work 	 shop 	 	.
i	guess	it	may	be	the	 re 	 venge 	 	of	the	guinea	pig	i	was	.
but	it	's	 may 	 be 	 	the	 convict 	 ion 	 	 a 	 s 	 	monkey	and	 hom 	 un 	 cul 	 us 	 	we	are	.
all	of	us	need	to	be	 consider 	 ed 	 	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	our	real	nature	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
