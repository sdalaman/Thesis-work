for	 year 	 s 	 	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	 frust 	 rated 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	religious	historian	,	i	've	 be 	 come 	 	 a 	 cute 	 ly 	 	aware	of	the	 central 	 ity 	 	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	in	all	the	major	world	 faith 	 s 	 	.
every	single	one	of	them	 ha 	 s 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	version	of	what	's	 be 	 en 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 gold 	 en 	 	rule	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	it	 come 	 s 	 	in	a	positive	version	--	``	 al 	 ways 	 	treat	all	 other 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	'd	like	to	be	 treat 	 ed 	 	 your 	 self 	 	.	``
and	 equal 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	is	the	negative	version	--	``	do	n't	do	to	 other 	 s 	 	what	you	would	not	like	them	to	do	to	you	.	``
look	 in 	 to 	 	your	own	heart	,
discover	what	it	is	that	 give 	 s 	 	you	pain	and	then	 re 	 fuse 	 	,	under	any	 circum 	 stance 	 	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	,	to	inflict	that	pain	on	 any 	 body 	 	else	.
and	people	have	 emphas 	 ized 	 	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	not	just	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 sound 	 s 	 	good	,	but	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
people	have	found	that	when	they	have	 implement 	 ed 	 	the	 gold 	 en 	 	rule	 a 	 s 	 	confucius	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	all	day	and	every	day	,	``	not	just	a	question	of	 do 	 ing 	 	your	good	 de 	 ed 	 	for	the	day	and	then	 return 	 ing 	 	to	a	life	of	greed	and	 egot 	 ism 	 	,	but	to	do	it	all	day	and	every	day	,	you	 dethron 	 e 	 	 your 	 self 	 	from	the	center	of	your	world	,	put	 an 	 other 	 	there	,	and	you	transcend	 your 	 self 	 	.
and	it	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	you	 in 	 to 	 	the	presence	of	what	's	 be 	 en 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	god	,	nirvana	,	rama	,	tao	.
 some 	 thing 	 	that	 go 	 es 	 	beyond	what	we	know	in	our	ego	-	bound	 exist 	 ence 	 	.
that	 th 	 is 	 	was	so	central	to	the	religious	life	.	 be 	 cause 	 	with	a	few	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 exception 	 s 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	often	when	religious	people	come	together	,	religious	 lead 	 ers 	 	come	together	,	they	're	 argu 	 ing 	 	about	 ab 	 s 	 tru 	 s 	 e 	 	 doctri 	 nes 	 	or	 utter 	 ing 	 	a	council	of	hatred	or	 inveigh 	 ing 	 	against	 homo 	 sexual 	 ity 	 	or	 some 	 thing 	 	of	that	sort	.
often	people	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	be	 com 	 passionate 	 	.
i	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	see	when	i	'm	 s 	 peaking 	 	to	a	 congreg 	 ation 	 	of	religious	people	a	sort	of	 mut 	 in 	 ous 	 	 express 	 ion 	 	 cross 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 face 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	people	often	want	to	be	right	 in 	 stead 	 	.
and	that	of	course	 defeat 	 s 	 	the	object	of	the	 exercis 	 e 	 	.
now	why	was	i	so	 grat 	 e 	 ful 	 	to	ted	?
 be 	 cause 	 	they	took	me	 ver 	 y 	 	 gent 	 ly 	 	from	my	book	-	lined	 stud 	 y 	 	and	 br 	 ought 	 	me	 in 	 to 	 	the	21st	century	,
 enabl 	 ing 	 	me	to	speak	to	a	much	,	much	 wide 	 r 	 	audience	than	i	could	have	ever	 conceiv 	 ed 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	feel	an	 urge 	 ncy 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
if	we	do	n't	manage	to	implement	the	 gold 	 en 	 	rule	 global 	 ly 	 	,	so	that	we	treat	all	 people 	 s 	 	,	 where 	 ver 	 	and	 who 	 ever 	 	they	may	be	,	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	i	doubt	that	we	'll	have	a	 vi 	 able 	 	world	to	hand	on	to	the	next	generation	.
the	task	of	our	time	,	one	of	the	great	 task 	 s 	 	of	our	time	,	is	to	build	a	global	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	where	people	can	live	together	in	peace	.
and	the	 relig 	 ions 	 	that	should	be	making	a	major	 con 	 trib 	 ution 	 	are	 in 	 stead 	 	 s 	 een 	 	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	the	problem	.
and	of	course	it	's	not	just	religious	people	who	 believ 	 e 	 	in	the	 gold 	 en 	 	rule	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	source	of	all	 moral 	 ity 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 imagin 	 ative 	 	act	of	 empath 	 y 	 	,	 put 	 ting 	 	 your 	 self 	 	in	the	place	of	 an 	 other 	 	.
and	so	we	have	a	choice	,	it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	.
we	can	either	go	on	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	out	or	 emphas 	 izing 	 	the	 dogma 	 tic 	 	and	 in 	 toler 	 ant 	 	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	of	our	faith	,	or	we	can	go	back	to	the	 rabbi 	 s 	 	.	rabbi	hillel	,	the	 old 	 er 	 	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	of	jesus	,	who	,	when	 ask 	 ed 	 	by	a	pagan	to	sum	up	the	whole	of	jewish	 teach 	 ing 	 	while	he	stood	on	one	leg	,	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	that	which	is	 hate 	 ful 	 	to	you	,	do	not	do	to	your	neighbor	.
that	is	the	torah	and	 every 	 thing 	 	else	is	 on 	 ly 	 	 comment 	 ary 	 	.	``
and	the	 rabbi 	 s 	 	and	the	early	 father 	 s 	 	of	the	church	who	 s 	 aid 	 	that	any	 interpret 	 ation 	 	of	 script 	 ure 	 	that	 br 	 ed 	 	hatred	and	disdain	was	 il 	 legitimate 	 	.
and	we	need	to	 rev 	 ive 	 	that	spirit	.
and	it	's	not	just	going	to	happen	 be 	 cause 	 	a	spirit	of	love	 waft 	 s 	 	us	down	.
we	have	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	happen	,	and	we	can	do	it	with	the	modern	 communication 	 s 	 	that	ted	 ha 	 s 	 	 introduc 	 ed 	 	.
 al 	 ready 	 	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 tremendous 	 ly 	 	 heart 	 ened 	 	at	the	 respons 	 e 	 	of	all	our	 partner 	 s 	 	.
in	singapore	,	we	have	a	group	going	to	use	the	 chart 	 er 	 	to	heal	 division 	 s 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	that	have	 sp 	 rung 	 	up	in	singaporean	 socie 	 ty 	 	,
and	some	 member 	 s 	 	of	the	parliament	want	to	implement	it	 politic 	 ally 	 	.
in	malaysia	,	there	is	going	to	be	an	art	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	in	which	 lead 	 ing 	 	 artist 	 s 	 	are	going	to	be	taking	people	,	young	people	,	and	 show 	 ing 	 	them	that	 compass 	 ion 	 	 al 	 so 	 	lies	at	the	root	of	all	art	.
 through 	 out 	 	europe	,	the	muslim	 commun 	 ities 	 	are	 hold 	 ing 	 	 event 	 s 	 	and	 discuss 	 ions 	 	,	are	 discuss 	 ing 	 	the	 central 	 ity 	 	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	in	islam	and	in	all	 faith 	 s 	 	.
but	it	ca	n't	stop	there	.	it	ca	n't	stop	with	the	launch	.
religious	 teach 	 ing 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	we	've	gone	so	wrong	,	 concent 	 rating 	 	 sole 	 ly 	 	on	 believ 	 ing 	 	 ab 	 s 	 tru 	 s 	 e 	 	 doctri 	 nes 	 	.
religious	 teach 	 ing 	 	must	 al 	 ways 	 	lead	to	action	.
and	i	intend	to	work	on	 th 	 is 	 	till	my	 dy 	 ing 	 	day	.
and	i	want	to	 continu 	 e 	 	with	our	 partner 	 s 	 	to	do	two	 thing 	 s 	 	--	 educ 	 ate 	 	and	 stimul 	 ate 	 	 com 	 passionate 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	.
education	 be 	 cause 	 	we	've	so	 drop 	 ped 	 	out	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
people	often	think	it	 simpl 	 y 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	sorry	for	 some 	 body 	 	.
but	of	course	you	do	n't	understand	 compass 	 ion 	 	if	you	're	just	going	to	think	about	it	.
you	 al 	 so 	 	have	to	do	it	.
i	want	them	to	get	the	media	 involve 	 d 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	media	are	 cruci 	 al 	 	in	 help 	 ing 	 	to	 dis 	 solve 	 	some	of	the	 stereo 	 typical 	 	 view 	 s 	 	we	have	of	other	people	,	which	are	 divid 	 ing 	 	us	from	one	 an 	 other 	 	.
the	same	 appli 	 es 	 	to	 educ 	 ators 	 	.
i	'd	like	youth	to	get	a	sense	of	the	 dynam 	 ism 	 	,	the	dynamic	and	 challeng 	 e 	 	of	a	 com 	 passionate 	 	 life 	 style 	 	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	see	that	it	 demand 	 s 	 	 a 	 cute 	 	 intellig 	 ence 	 	,	not	just	a	 go 	 o 	 ey 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	.
i	'd	like	to	call	 up 	 on 	 	 scholar 	 s 	 	to	explore	the	 com 	 passionate 	 	theme	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	and	in	other	people	's	 tradition 	 s 	 	.	and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	above	all	,	to	 encourag 	 e 	 	a	 sensitiv 	 ity 	 	about	 un 	 com 	 passionate 	 	 s 	 peaking 	 	,
so	that	 be 	 cause 	 	people	have	 th 	 is 	 	 chart 	 er 	 	,	 what 	 ever 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 belief 	 s 	 	or	lack	of	them	,	they	feel	 empower 	 ed 	 	to	 challeng 	 e 	 	 un 	 com 	 passionate 	 	speech	,	 disdain 	 ful 	 	 remark 	 s 	 	from	 the 	 ir 	 	religious	 lead 	 ers 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 politic 	 al 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	,	from	the	 cap 	 tain 	 s 	 	of	industry	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	can	change	the	world	,
we	have	the	ability	.
i	would	never	have	thought	of	 put 	 ting 	 	the	 chart 	 er 	 	 on 	 line 	 	.
i	was	still	 s 	 tuck 	 	in	the	old	world	of	a	whole	bunch	of	 b 	 off 	 in 	 s 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	together	in	a	room	and	 is 	 suing 	 	yet	 an 	 other 	 	 arc 	 ane 	 	 state 	 ment 	 	.
and	ted	 introduc 	 ed 	 	me	to	a	whole	new	way	of	 think 	 ing 	 	and	 present 	 ing 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	that	is	what	is	so	 wonder 	 ful 	 	about	ted	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	all	 th 	 is 	 	 expert 	 ise 	 	,	if	we	 join 	 ed 	 	it	all	together	,	we	could	change	the	world	.
and	of	course	the	 problem 	 s 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	seem	 in 	 super 	 able 	 	.	but	i	'd	just	like	to	quote	,	finish	at	the	end	with	a	 re 	 ference 	 	to	a	british	author	,	an	oxford	author	whom	i	do	n't	quote	 ver 	 y 	 	often	,	c.s	.	lewis	.
but	he	wrote	one	thing	that	 s 	 tuck 	 	in	my	mind	ever	since	i	read	it	when	i	was	a	 school 	 girl 	 	.
it	's	in	his	book	``	the	four	 love 	 s 	 	.	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	that	he	 distinguish 	 ed 	 	between	 er 	 otic 	 	love	,	when	two	people	 gaz 	 e 	 	,	 spell 	 bound 	 	,	 in 	 to 	 	each	other	's	 eye 	 s 	 	.	and	then	he	 compar 	 ed 	 	that	to	 friend 	 ship 	 	,	when	two	people	stand	side	by	side	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 we 	 re 	 	,	shoulder	to	shoulder	,	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	 fix 	 ed 	 	on	a	common	goal	.
we	do	n't	have	to	fall	in	love	with	each	other	,	but	we	can	 be 	 come 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	.
and	i	am	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	.	i	felt	it	 ver 	 y 	 	 strong 	 ly 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	our	little	 de 	 liber 	 ations 	 	at	vevey	,	that	when	people	of	all	different	 persuas 	 ions 	 	come	together	,	 work 	 ing 	 	side	by	side	for	a	common	goal	,	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	melt	away	.
and	we	learn	 am 	 ity 	 	.
and	we	learn	to	live	together	and	to	get	to	know	one	 an 	 other 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
