can	any	of	you	remember	what	you	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	when	you	 we 	 re 	 	17	?
do	you	know	what	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	?
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	a	 bike 	 r 	 	chick	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	race	 car 	 s 	 	,	and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	a	 cow 	 girl 	 	,	and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	mowgli	from	``	the	jungle	book	.	``
 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	all	about	 be 	 ing 	 	free	,	the	wind	in	your	hair	--	just	to	be	free	.
and	on	my	seventeenth	 birth 	 day 	 	,	my	 parent 	 s 	 	,	 know 	 ing 	 	how	much	i	 love 	 d 	 	speed	,	 g 	 ave 	 	me	one	 driv 	 ing 	 	 less 	 on 	 	for	my	seventeenth	 birth 	 day 	 	.
not	that	we	could	have	 afford 	 ed 	 	i	drive	,	but	to	give	me	the	dream	of	 driv 	 ing 	 	.
and	on	my	seventeenth	 birth 	 day 	 	,	i	 accompani 	 ed 	 	my	little	sister	in	complete	 innoc 	 ence 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 al 	 ways 	 	had	all	my	life	--	my	 visual 	 ly 	 	 impair 	 ed 	 	sister	--	to	go	to	see	an	eye	 special 	 ist 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	big	 sister 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 ways 	 	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	support	 the 	 ir 	 	little	 sister 	 s 	 	.
and	my	little	sister	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	a	pilot	--	god	help	her	.
so	i	used	to	get	my	 eye 	 s 	 	tested	just	for	 f 	 un 	 	.
and	on	my	seventeenth	 birth 	 day 	 	,	after	my	fake	eye	 ex 	 am 	 	,	the	eye	 special 	 ist 	 	just	 notice 	 d 	 	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	be	my	 birth 	 day 	 	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	so	what	are	you	going	to	do	to	 celebr 	 ate 	 	?	``
and	i	took	that	 driv 	 ing 	 	 less 	 on 	 	,	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'm	going	to	learn	how	to	drive	.	``
and	then	there	was	a	silence	--	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	awful	 silence 	 s 	 	when	you	know	 some 	 thing 	 	's	wrong	.
and	he	 turn 	 ed 	 	to	my	mother	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	have	n't	told	her	yet	?	``
on	my	seventeenth	 birth 	 day 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	janis	ian	would	best	say	,	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	the	truth	at	17.	i	am	,	and	have	 be 	 en 	 	since	birth	,	 legal 	 ly 	 	blind	.	and	you	know	,	how	on	earth	did	i	get	to	17	and	not	know	that	?
well	,	if	 any 	 body 	 	 say 	 s 	 	country	music	is	n't	 power 	 ful 	 	,	let	me	tell	you	 th 	 is 	 	:	i	got	there	 be 	 cause 	 	my	father	's	 pass 	 ion 	 	for	johnny	cash	and	a	song	,	``	a	boy	named	 s 	 ue 	 	.	``	i	'm	the	 el 	 d 	 est 	 	of	three	.	i	was	born	in	1971	.
and	 ver 	 y 	 	 short 	 ly 	 	after	my	birth	,	my	 parent 	 s 	 	found	out	i	had	a	condition	 call 	 ed 	 	ocular	 al 	 bin 	 ism 	 	.
and	what	the	hell	 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	to	you	?
so	let	me	just	tell	you	,	the	great	part	of	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	?	i	ca	n't	see	 th 	 is 	 	clock	and	i	ca	n't	see	the	 tim 	 ing 	 	,	so	holy	god	,	woohoo	!
i	might	buy	some	more	time	.
but	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	let	me	tell	you	--	i	'm	going	to	come	up	 re 	 ally 	 	close	here	.	do	n't	freak	out	,	pat	.
 he 	 y 	 	.
see	 th 	 is 	 	hand	?
beyond	 th 	 is 	 	hand	is	a	world	of	vaseline	.
every	man	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	even	you	,	steve	,	is	george	clooney	.
and	every	woman	,	you	are	so	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
and	when	i	want	to	look	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	i	step	three	feet	away	from	the	mirror	,	and	i	do	n't	have	to	see	these	lines	 etch 	 ed 	 	in	my	face	from	all	the	 s 	 quint 	 ing 	 	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	all	my	life	from	all	the	dark	 light 	 s 	 	.
the	 re 	 ally 	 	strange	part	is	that	,	at	three	and	a	half	,	just	before	i	was	going	to	school	,	my	 parent 	 s 	 	made	a	bizarre	,	 un 	 usual 	 	and	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	brave	decision	.
no	special	 need 	 s 	 	 school 	 s 	 	.	no	 label 	 s 	 	.
no	 limit 	 ations 	 	.
my	ability	and	my	potential	.
and	they	 decide 	 d 	 	to	tell	me	that	i	could	see	.
so	just	like	johnny	cash	's	 s 	 ue 	 	,	a	boy	 give 	 n 	 	a	girl	's	name	,	i	would	grow	up	and	learn	from	experience	how	to	be	tough	and	how	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	,	when	they	 we 	 re 	 	no	 long 	 er 	 	there	to	protect	me	,	or	just	take	it	all	away	.
but	more	 significant 	 ly 	 	,	they	 g 	 ave 	 	me	the	ability	to	 believ 	 e 	 	,	 total 	 ly 	 	,	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	i	could	.
and	so	when	i	heard	that	eye	 special 	 ist 	 	tell	me	all	the	 thing 	 s 	 	,	a	big	fat	``	no	,	``	 every 	 body 	 	 imagine 	 s 	 	i	was	 deva 	 state 	 d 	 	.
and	do	n't	get	me	wrong	,	 be 	 cause 	 	when	i	first	heard	it	--	 a 	 side 	 	from	the	fact	that	i	thought	he	was	 insan 	 e 	 	--	i	got	that	thump	in	my	chest	,	just	that	``	huh	?	``
but	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	i	 re 	 cover 	 ed 	 	.	it	was	like	that	.
the	first	thing	i	thought	about	was	my	mom	,	who	was	 cry 	 ing 	 	over	 be 	 side 	 	me	.
and	i	 s 	 wear 	 	to	god	,	i	 walk 	 ed 	 	out	of	his	 off 	 ice 	 	,	``	i	will	drive	.	i	will	drive	.
you	're	mad	.	i	'll	drive	.	i	know	i	can	drive	.	``	and	with	the	same	 dog 	 ged 	 	 determi 	 nation 	 	that	my	father	had	 br 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	me	since	i	was	 s 	 uch 	 	a	child	--	he	taught	me	how	to	sail	,	 know 	 ing 	 	i	could	never	see	where	i	was	going	,	i	could	never	see	the	shore	,	and	i	could	n't	see	the	 sail 	 s 	 	,	and	i	could	n't	see	the	destination	.
but	he	told	me	to	 believ 	 e 	 	and	feel	the	wind	in	my	face	.
and	that	wind	in	my	face	made	me	 believ 	 e 	 	that	he	was	mad	and	i	would	drive	.
and	for	the	next	11	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	 s 	 wo 	 re 	 	 no 	 body 	 	would	ever	find	out	that	i	could	n't	see	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	did	n't	want	to	be	a	failure	,	and	i	did	n't	want	to	be	weak	.
and	i	 believ 	 ed 	 	i	could	do	it	.
so	i	 ramm 	 ed 	 	through	life	 a 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	a	casey	can	do	.
and	i	was	an	 archeo 	 logist 	 	,	and	then	i	broke	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	then	i	 manage 	 d 	 	a	restaurant	,	and	then	i	 s 	 lipped 	 	on	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	then	i	was	a	 masse 	 use 	 	.	and	then	i	was	a	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	 garden 	 er 	 	.
and	then	i	went	to	business	school	.
and	you	know	,	 dis 	 able 	 d 	 	people	are	 huge 	 ly 	 	educated	.
and	then	i	went	in	and	i	got	a	global	 consult 	 ing 	 	job	with	accenture	.	and	they	did	n't	even	know	.
and	it	's	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	how	far	belief	can	take	you	.
in	1999	,	two	and	a	half	 year 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	that	job	,	 some 	 thing 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.	 wonder 	 fully 	 	,	my	 eye 	 s 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	,	 en 	 ough 	 	.
and	 tempor 	 arily 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 ly 	 	,	they	 drop 	 ped 	 	.
and	i	'm	in	one	of	the	most	competitive	 environment 	 s 	 	in	the	world	,	where	you	work	hard	,	play	hard	,	you	got	ta	be	the	best	,	you	got	ta	be	the	best	.
and	two	 year 	 s 	 	in	,	i	 re 	 ally 	 	could	see	 ver 	 y 	 	little	.
and	i	found	 my 	 self 	 	in	front	of	an	hr	 manage 	 r 	 	in	1999	,	 say 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	i	never	 imagin 	 ed 	 	that	i	would	say	.
i	was	28	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
i	had	built	a	 person 	 a 	 	all	around	what	i	could	and	could	n't	do	.
and	i	 simpl 	 y 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'm	sorry	.
i	ca	n't	see	,	and	i	need	help	.	``	 ask 	 ing 	 	for	help	can	be	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	difficult	.
and	you	all	know	what	it	is	.	you	do	n't	need	to	have	a	 dis 	 ability 	 	to	know	that	.
we	all	know	how	hard	it	is	to	admit	 weak 	 ness 	 	and	failure	.
and	it	's	 frighten 	 ing 	 	,	is	n't	it	?
but	all	that	belief	had	 fuel 	 ed 	 	me	so	long	.
and	can	i	tell	you	,	 oper 	 ating 	 	in	the	 sight 	 ed 	 	world	when	you	ca	n't	see	,	it	's	kind	of	difficult	--	it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	.
can	i	tell	you	,	 air 	 port 	 s 	 	are	a	disaster	.
oh	,	for	the	love	of	god	.
and	 pleas 	 e 	 	,	any	 design 	 ers 	 	out	there	?
ok	,	 design 	 ers 	 	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	put	up	your	 hand 	 s 	 	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	i	ca	n't	even	see	you	.
i	 al 	 ways 	 	end	up	in	the	 gent 	 s 	 	'	 toilet 	 s 	 	.
and	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	wrong	with	my	sense	of	smell	.
but	can	i	just	tell	you	,	the	little	sign	for	a	 gent 	 s 	 	'	toilet	or	a	 lad 	 ies 	 	'	toilet	is	 determine 	 d 	 	by	a	triangle	.
have	you	ever	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	see	that	if	you	have	vaseline	in	front	of	your	 eye 	 s 	 	?
it	's	 s 	 uch 	 	a	small	thing	,	right	?
and	you	know	how	 exhaust 	 ing 	 	it	can	be	to	try	to	be	perfect	when	you	're	not	,	or	to	be	 some 	 body 	 	that	you	are	n't	?
and	so	after	 admit 	 ting 	 	i	could	n't	see	to	hr	,	they	 s 	 ent 	 	me	off	to	an	eye	 special 	 ist 	 	.
and	i	had	no	idea	that	 th 	 is 	 	man	was	going	to	change	my	life	.
but	before	i	got	to	him	,	i	was	so	lost	.
i	had	no	idea	who	i	was	 any 	 more 	 	.
and	that	eye	 special 	 ist 	 	,	he	did	n't	 both 	 er 	 	 test 	 ing 	 	my	 eye 	 s 	 	.
god	no	,	it	was	therapy	.
and	he	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 question 	 s 	 	,	of	which	 man 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	,	``	why	?
why	are	you	 fight 	 ing 	 	so	hard	not	to	be	 your 	 self 	 	?
and	do	you	love	what	you	do	,	caroline	?	``	and	you	know	,	when	you	go	to	a	global	 consult 	 ing 	 	firm	,	they	put	a	chip	in	your	head	,	and	you	're	like	,	``	i	love	accenture	.	i	love	accenture	.	i	love	my	job	.	i	love	accenture	.
i	love	accenture	.	i	love	accenture	.	i	love	my	job	.	i	love	accenture	.	``	to	 leav 	 e 	 	would	be	failure	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	do	you	love	it	?	``
i	could	n't	even	speak	i	was	so	 choke 	 d 	 	up	.
i	just	was	so	--	how	do	i	tell	him	?
and	then	he	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	``	what	did	you	want	to	be	when	you	 we 	 re 	 	little	?	``
now	listen	,	i	was	n't	going	to	say	to	him	,	``	well	,	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	race	 car 	 s 	 	and	 motor 	 bike 	 s 	 	.	``
 hard 	 ly 	 	appropriate	at	 th 	 is 	 	moment	in	time	.
he	thought	i	was	mad	 en 	 ough 	 	 any 	 way 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	left	his	 off 	 ice 	 	,	he	 call 	 ed 	 	me	back	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	think	it	's	time	.
i	think	it	's	time	to	stop	 fight 	 ing 	 	and	do	 some 	 thing 	 	different	.	``	and	that	door	closed	.
and	that	silence	just	 out 	 side 	 	a	doctor	's	 off 	 ice 	 	,	that	 man 	 y 	 	of	us	know	.
and	my	chest	 ach 	 ed 	 	.
and	i	had	no	idea	where	i	was	going	.	i	had	no	idea	.
but	i	did	know	the	game	was	up	.
and	i	went	home	,	and	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	pain	in	my	chest	 ach 	 ed 	 	so	much	,	i	thought	,	``	i	'll	go	out	for	a	run	.	``
 re 	 ally 	 	not	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 sens 	 ible 	 	thing	to	do	.

i	 al 	 ways 	 	run	it	 perfect 	 ly 	 	fine	.

and	there	was	a	rock	that	i	 al 	 ways 	 	 mis 	 s 	 ed 	 	.
and	i	'd	never	 fall 	 en 	 	on	it	,	never	.
and	there	i	was	 cry 	 ing 	 	away	,	and	 s 	 mash 	 	,	bash	on	my	rock	.

and	i	 ke 	 pt 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	over	and	over	in	my	mind	,	what	had	 happen 	 ed 	 	?	where	did	it	go	wrong	?	why	did	n't	i	understand	?
and	you	know	,	the	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	part	of	it	is	i	just	 simpl 	 y 	 	had	no	 answer 	 s 	 	.	i	had	lost	my	belief	.

and	now	i	had	lost	it	.	and	now	i	 re 	 ally 	 	could	n't	see	.
i	was	 crumple 	 d 	 	.
and	then	i	remember	 think 	 ing 	 	about	that	eye	 special 	 ist 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	me	,	``	what	do	you	want	to	be	?	what	do	you	want	to	be	?

when	i	came	home	off	that	elephant	,	do	you	know	what	the	most	 amaz 	 ing 	 	part	was	?
i	 chuck 	 ed 	 	in	my	job	at	accenture	.
i	left	,	and	i	 be 	 came 	 	a	social	entrepreneur	,	and	i	set	up	an	 organ 	 ization 	 	with	mark	shand	 call 	 ed 	 	elephant	family	,	which	 deal 	 s 	 	with	asian	elephant	 conserv 	 ation 	 	.
and	i	set	up	kanchi	,	 be 	 cause 	 	my	 organ 	 ization 	 	was	 al 	 ways 	 	going	to	be	named	after	my	elephant	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 dis 	 ability 	 	is	like	the	elephant	in	the	room	.
and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	make	you	see	it	in	a	positive	way	--	no	 char 	 ity 	 	,	no	 p 	 ity 	 	.
but	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	work	 on 	 ly 	 	and	 tru 	 ly 	 	with	business	and	media	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	to	 total 	 ly 	 	 re 	 frame 	 	 dis 	 ability 	 	in	a	way	that	was	 excit 	 ing 	 	and	possible	.
it	was	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	.
that	's	what	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	.
and	i	never	thought	about	 no 	 es 	 	 any 	 more 	 	,	or	not	 see 	 ing 	 	,	or	any	of	that	kind	of	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
it	just	 seem 	 ed 	 	that	it	was	possible	.
and	you	know	,	the	 odd 	 est 	 	part	is	,	when	i	was	on	my	way	 travel 	 ing 	 	here	to	ted	,	i	'll	be	honest	,	i	was	 petr 	 ified 	 	.
and	i	speak	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	audience	,	and	what	am	i	 do 	 ing 	 	here	?
but	 a 	 s 	 	i	was	 travel 	 ing 	 	here	,	you	'll	be	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	to	know	,	i	did	use	my	white	symbol	stick	 can 	 e 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	good	to	skip	 queue 	 s 	 	in	the	 air 	 port 	 	.
and	i	got	my	way	here	 be 	 ing 	 	 hap 	 pi 	 ly 	 	proud	that	i	could	n't	see	.
and	the	one	thing	is	that	a	 re 	 ally 	 	good	friend	of	mine	,	he	 text 	 ed 	 	me	on	the	way	over	,	 know 	 ing 	 	i	was	 scar 	 ed 	 	.
even	 th 	 ough 	 	i	present	confident	,	i	was	 scar 	 ed 	 	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	be	you	.	``
and	so	here	i	am	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	me	,	all	of	me	.
and	i	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	,	you	know	what	,	 car 	 s 	 	and	 motor 	 bike 	 s 	 	and	 elephant 	 s 	 	,	that	's	not	 free 	 dom 	 	.
 be 	 ing 	 	 absolute 	 ly 	 	true	to	 your 	 self 	 	is	 free 	 dom 	 	.
and	i	never	 need 	 ed 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	to	see	--	never	.
i	 simpl 	 y 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	vision	and	belief	.
and	if	you	 tru 	 ly 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	--	and	i	mean	 believ 	 e 	 	from	the	bottom	of	your	heart	--	you	can	make	change	happen	.
and	we	need	to	make	it	happen	,	 be 	 cause 	 	every	single	one	of	us	--	woman	,	man	,	 ga 	 y 	 	,	straight	,	 dis 	 able 	 d 	 	,	perfect	,	normal	,	 what 	 ever 	 	--	 every 	 one 	 	of	us	must	be	the	 ver 	 y 	 	best	of	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
i	no	 long 	 er 	 	want	 any 	 body 	 	to	be	 in 	 visible 	 	.
we	all	have	to	be	 include 	 d 	 	.
and	stop	with	the	 label 	 s 	 	,	the	 limit 	 ing 	 	.	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	of	 label 	 s 	 	,
 be 	 cause 	 	we	are	not	jam	 jar 	 s 	 	.	we	are	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	,	different	,	 wonder 	 ful 	 	people	.
thank	you	.
