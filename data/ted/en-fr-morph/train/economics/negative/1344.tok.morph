when	i	was	seven	 year 	 s 	 	old	and	my	sister	was	just	five	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	on	top	of	a	bunk	bed	.
i	was	two	 year 	 s 	 	 old 	 er 	 	than	my	sister	at	the	time	--	i	mean	,	i	'm	two	 year 	 s 	 	 old 	 er 	 	than	her	now	--	but	at	the	time	it	 me 	 ant 	 	she	had	to	do	 every 	 thing 	 	that	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	,	and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	play	war	.
so	we	 we 	 re 	 	up	on	top	of	our	bunk	 bed 	 s 	 	.
and	on	one	side	of	the	bunk	bed	,	i	had	put	out	all	of	my	g.i	.	joe	 soldier 	 s 	 	and	 weapon 	 ry 	 	.
and	on	the	other	side	 we 	 re 	 	all	my	sister	's	my	little	 p 	 onies 	 	ready	for	a	cavalry	charge	.
there	are	 differ 	 ing 	 	 account 	 s 	 	of	what	 actual 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	that	afternoon	,	but	since	my	sister	is	not	here	with	us	 to 	 day 	 	,	let	me	tell	you	the	true	story	--
--	which	is	my	sister	's	a	little	bit	on	the	clumsy	side	.
 some 	 how 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	any	help	or	push	from	her	 old 	 er 	 	brother	at	all	,	 sudden 	 ly 	 	amy	 disappear 	 ed 	 	off	of	the	top	of	the	bunk	bed	and	 land 	 ed 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	crash	on	the	floor	.
now	i	 nervous 	 ly 	 	 peer 	 ed 	 	over	the	side	of	the	bed	to	see	what	had	 be 	 fall 	 en 	 	my	 fall 	 en 	 	sister	and	saw	that	she	had	 land 	 ed 	 	 pain 	 fully 	 	on	her	 hand 	 s 	 	and	 knee 	 s 	 	on	all	 four 	 s 	 	on	the	ground	.
i	was	nervous	 be 	 cause 	 	my	 parent 	 s 	 	had	charged	me	with	making	 s 	 ure 	 	that	my	sister	and	i	 play 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 safe 	 ly 	 	and	 a 	 s 	 	 quiet 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	possible	.
and	 see 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	how	i	had	 accident 	 ally 	 	broken	amy	's	arm	just	one	week	before	...
...	 hero 	 ically 	 	 push 	 ing 	 	her	out	of	the	way	of	an	 on 	 coming 	 	 imagin 	 ary 	 	 snip 	 er 	 	bullet	,	for	which	i	have	yet	to	be	 thank 	 ed 	 	,	i	was	 try 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	hard	 a 	 s 	 	i	could	--	she	did	n't	even	see	it	coming	--	i	was	 try 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	hard	 a 	 s 	 	i	could	to	be	on	my	best	behavior	.
and	i	saw	my	sister	's	face	,	 th 	 is 	 	wail	of	pain	and	 suffer 	 ing 	 	and	surprise	 threaten 	 ing 	 	to	erupt	from	her	mouth	and	 threaten 	 ing 	 	to	wake	my	 parent 	 s 	 	from	the	long	winter	's	nap	for	which	they	had	 settl 	 ed 	 	.
so	i	did	the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	my	little	 fr 	 antic 	 	seven	year	-	old	brain	could	think	to	do	to	 a 	 vert 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	.
and	if	you	have	children	,	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 time 	 s 	 	before	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	amy	,	amy	,	wait	.	do	n't	cry	.	do	n't	cry	.
did	you	see	how	you	 land 	 ed 	 	?
no	human	 land 	 s 	 	on	all	 four 	 s 	 	like	that	.
amy	,	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	you	're	a	 uni 	 corn 	 	.	``	now	that	was	 cheat 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	was	 noth 	 ing 	 	in	the	world	my	sister	would	want	more	than	not	to	be	amy	the	hurt	five	year	-	old	little	sister	,	but	amy	the	special	 uni 	 corn 	 	.
of	course	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	an	option	that	was	open	to	her	brain	at	no	point	in	the	past	.
and	you	could	see	how	my	poor	,	 manipul 	 ated 	 	sister	 face 	 d 	 	conflict	,	 a 	 s 	 	her	little	brain	 attempt 	 ed 	 	to	devote	 resource 	 s 	 	to	 feel 	 ing 	 	the	pain	and	 suffer 	 ing 	 	and	surprise	she	just	 experience 	 d 	 	,	or	 contempl 	 ating 	 	her	new	-	found	 ident 	 ity 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 uni 	 corn 	 	.
and	the	 lat 	 ter 	 	won	out	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	 cry 	 ing 	 	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 ce 	 a 	 s 	 ing 	 	our	play	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 wa 	 king 	 	my	 parent 	 s 	 	,	with	all	the	negative	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	that	would	have	 en 	 su 	 ed 	 	for	me	,	 in 	 stead 	 	a	 s 	 mile 	 	spread	 a 	 cross 	 	her	face	and	she	 scramble 	 d 	 	right	back	up	onto	the	bunk	bed	with	all	the	grace	of	a	baby	 uni 	 corn 	 	...
...	with	one	broken	leg	.
what	we	 s 	 tumble 	 d 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	tender	age	of	just	five	and	seven	--	we	had	no	idea	at	the	time	--	was	 some 	 thing 	 	that	was	going	be	at	the	 van 	 guard 	 	of	a	scientific	revolution	 occur 	 ring 	 	two	 decade 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	in	the	way	that	we	look	at	the	human	brain	.
what	we	had	 s 	 tumble 	 d 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	positive	 psycho 	 logy 	 	,	which	is	the	reason	that	i	'm	here	 to 	 day 	 	and	the	reason	that	i	wake	up	every	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
when	i	first	 start 	 ed 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	research	 out 	 side 	 	of	academia	,	out	with	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	and	 school 	 s 	 	,	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	thing	they	 s 	 aid 	 	to	never	do	is	to	start	your	talk	with	a	graph	.
the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	thing	i	want	to	do	is	start	my	talk	with	a	graph	.
 th 	 is 	 	graph	 look 	 s 	 	 bor 	 ing 	 	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	graph	is	the	reason	i	get	 excit 	 ed 	 	and	wake	up	every	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	graph	 do 	 es 	 	n't	even	mean	 any 	 thing 	 	;	it	's	fake	data	.
what	we	found	is	--	if	i	got	 th 	 is 	 	data	back	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	you	here	in	the	room	,	i	would	be	 thrill 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 clear 	 ly 	 	a	trend	that	's	going	on	there	,	and	that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	i	can	get	 publish 	 ed 	 	,	which	is	all	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 matter 	 s 	 	.
the	fact	that	there	's	one	weird	red	dot	that	's	up	above	the	 curv 	 e 	 	,	there	's	one	 weird 	 o 	 	in	the	room	--	i	know	who	you	are	,	i	saw	you	 ear 	 lier 	 	--	that	's	no	problem	.
that	's	no	problem	,	 a 	 s 	 	most	of	you	know	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	can	just	delete	that	dot	.
i	can	delete	that	dot	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	 clear 	 ly 	 	a	 measure 	 ment 	 	error	.
and	we	know	that	's	a	 measure 	 ment 	 	error	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 mess 	 ing 	 	up	my	data	.
so	one	of	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	 thing 	 s 	 	we	teach	people	in	 economic 	 s 	 	and	 statistic 	 s 	 	and	business	and	 psycho 	 logy 	 	 course 	 s 	 	is	how	,	in	a	 statistic 	 ally 	 	valid	way	,	do	we	eliminate	the	 weird 	 os 	 	.
how	do	we	eliminate	the	 out 	 lier 	 s 	 	so	we	can	find	the	line	of	best	fit	?
which	is	fantastic	if	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	find	out	how	 man 	 y 	 	advil	the	average	person	should	be	taking	--	two	.
but	if	i	'm	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	potential	,	if	i	'm	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	your	potential	,	or	for	happiness	or	 product 	 ivity 	 	or	energy	or	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	,	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	is	we	're	creating	the	cult	of	the	average	with	science	.
if	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	a	question	like	,	``	how	fast	can	a	child	learn	how	to	read	in	a	 class 	 room 	 	?	``	 scientist 	 s 	 	change	the	answer	to	``	how	fast	 do 	 es 	 	the	average	child	learn	how	to	read	in	that	 class 	 room 	 	?	``	and	then	we	tailor	the	class	right	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	average	.
now	if	you	fall	 be 	 low 	 	the	average	on	 th 	 is 	 	 curv 	 e 	 	,	then	 psycho 	 logists 	 	get	 thrill 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	 mean 	 s 	 	you	're	either	 depress 	 ed 	 	or	you	have	a	 dis 	 order 	 	,	or	 hope 	 fully 	 	both	.
we	're	 hop 	 ing 	 	for	both	 be 	 cause 	 	our	business	model	is	,	if	you	come	 in 	 to 	 	a	therapy	session	with	one	problem	,	we	want	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	you	 leav 	 e 	 	 know 	 ing 	 	you	have	10	,	so	you	keep	coming	back	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	.
we	'll	go	back	 in 	 to 	 	your	 child 	 hood 	 	if	 necess 	 ary 	 	,	but	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	what	we	want	to	do	is	make	you	normal	 aga 	 in 	 	.
but	normal	is	 mere 	 ly 	 	average	.
and	what	i	posit	and	what	positive	 psycho 	 logy 	 	 posit 	 s 	 	is	that	if	we	 stud 	 y 	 	what	is	 mere 	 ly 	 	average	,	we	will	remain	 mere 	 ly 	 	average	.
then	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 delet 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	positive	 out 	 lier 	 s 	 	,	what	i	 intentional 	 ly 	 	do	is	come	 in 	 to 	 	a	population	like	 th 	 is 	 	one	and	say	,	why	?
why	is	it	that	some	of	you	are	so	high	above	the	 curv 	 e 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	your	intellectual	ability	,	athletic	ability	,	musical	ability	,	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	,	energy	 level 	 s 	 	,	your	 resili 	 ency 	 	in	the	face	of	 challeng 	 e 	 	,	your	sense	of	humor	?
 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 delet 	 ing 	 	you	,	what	i	want	to	do	is	 stud 	 y 	 	you	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 may 	 be 	 	we	can	 gle 	 an 	 	information	--	not	just	how	to	move	people	up	to	the	average	,	but	how	we	can	move	the	entire	average	up	in	our	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	and	 school 	 s 	 	 world 	 wide 	 	.
the	reason	 th 	 is 	 	graph	is	 import 	 ant 	 	to	me	is	,	when	i	turn	on	the	news	,	it	 seem 	 s 	 	like	the	 major 	 ity 	 	of	the	information	is	not	positive	,	in	fact	it	's	negative	.
most	of	it	's	about	murder	,	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	,	 disease 	 s 	 	,	natural	 disaster 	 s 	 	.
and	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	my	brain	 start 	 s 	 	to	think	that	's	the	accurate	ratio	of	negative	to	positive	in	the	world	.
what	that	's	 do 	 ing 	 	is	creating	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	medical	school	syndrome	--	which	,	if	you	know	people	who	've	 be 	 en 	 	to	medical	school	,	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	first	year	of	medical	training	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	read	through	a	list	of	all	the	 symptom 	 s 	 	and	 disease 	 s 	 	that	could	happen	,	 sudden 	 ly 	 	you	 real 	 ize 	 	you	have	all	of	them	.
i	have	a	brother	in	-	law	named	bobo	--	which	is	a	whole	other	story	.
bobo	married	amy	the	 uni 	 corn 	 	.
bobo	 call 	 ed 	 	me	on	the	phone	from	yale	medical	school	,	and	bobo	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	shawn	,	i	have	 le 	 pro 	 s 	 y 	 	.	``	which	,	even	at	yale	,	is	 extra 	 ordinari 	 ly 	 	rare	.
but	i	had	no	idea	how	to	 consol 	 e 	 	poor	bobo	 be 	 cause 	 	he	had	just	gotten	over	an	entire	week	of	 men 	 o 	 pause 	 	.
see	what	we	're	 find 	 ing 	 	is	it	's	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	the	 re 	 ality 	 	that	 shape 	 s 	 	us	,	but	the	lens	through	which	your	brain	 view 	 s 	 	the	world	that	 shape 	 s 	 	your	 re 	 ality 	 	.
and	if	we	can	change	the	lens	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	can	we	change	your	happiness	,	we	can	change	every	single	 education 	 al 	 	and	business	 out 	 come 	 	at	the	same	time	.
when	i	 appli 	 ed 	 	to	harvard	,	i	 appli 	 ed 	 	on	a	 da 	 re 	 	.
i	did	n't	expect	to	get	in	,	and	my	family	had	no	money	for	college	.
when	i	got	a	 militar 	 y 	 	 scholar 	 ship 	 	two	 week 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	they	 allow 	 ed 	 	me	to	go	.
 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	was	n't	even	a	 possibil 	 ity 	 	 be 	 came 	 	a	 re 	 ality 	 	.
when	i	went	there	,	i	 assum 	 ed 	 	 every 	 one 	 	else	would	see	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	privilege	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	that	they	'd	be	 excit 	 ed 	 	to	be	there	.
even	if	you	're	in	a	 class 	 room 	 	full	of	people	 smart 	 er 	 	than	you	,	you	'd	be	happy	just	to	be	in	that	 class 	 room 	 	,	which	is	what	i	felt	.
but	what	i	found	there	is	,	while	some	people	experience	that	,	when	i	 graduate 	 d 	 	after	my	four	 year 	 s 	 	and	then	 s 	 pent 	 	the	next	eight	 year 	 s 	 	living	in	the	 dorm 	 s 	 	with	the	 student 	 s 	 	--	harvard	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	to	;	i	was	n't	that	guy	.
i	was	an	officer	of	harvard	to	counsel	 student 	 s 	 	through	the	difficult	four	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	what	i	found	in	my	research	and	my	 teach 	 ing 	 	is	that	these	 student 	 s 	 	,	no	matter	how	happy	they	 we 	 re 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	original	success	of	 get 	 ting 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	school	,	two	 week 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 brain 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	focused	,	not	on	the	privilege	of	 be 	 ing 	 	there	,	nor	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 philosoph 	 y 	 	or	 the 	 ir 	 	physics	.
 the 	 ir 	 	brain	was	focused	on	the	 com 	 petition 	 	,	the	 work 	 load 	 	,	the	 hassle 	 s 	 	,	the	 stress 	 es 	 	,	the	 complain 	 ts 	 	.
when	i	first	went	in	there	,	i	 walk 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 fresh 	 men 	 	 din 	 ing 	 	hall	,	which	is	where	my	 friend 	 s 	 	from	waco	,	texas	,	which	is	where	i	grew	up	--	i	know	some	of	you	have	heard	of	it	.	when	they	'd	come	to	visit	me	,	they	'd	look	around	,	they	'd	say	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	 fresh 	 man 	 	 din 	 ing 	 	hall	 look 	 s 	 	like	 some 	 thing 	 	out	of	hogwart	's	from	the	movie	``	harry	potter	,	``	which	it	 do 	 es 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	hogwart	's	from	the	movie	``	harry	potter	``	and	that	's	harvard	.
and	when	they	see	 th 	 is 	 	,	they	say	,	``	shawn	,	why	do	you	waste	your	time	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	happiness	at	harvard	?
 serious 	 ly 	 	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	a	harvard	student	possibly	have	to	be	 un 	 happy 	 	about	?	``	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	 with 	 in 	 	that	question	is	the	key	to	 understand 	 ing 	 	the	science	of	happiness	.
 be 	 cause 	 	what	that	question	 assum 	 es 	 	is	that	our	external	world	is	 predict 	 ive 	 	of	our	happiness	 level 	 s 	 	,	when	in	 re 	 ality 	 	,	if	i	know	 every 	 thing 	 	about	your	external	world	,	i	can	 on 	 ly 	 	predict	10	percent	of	your	long	-	term	happiness	.
90	percent	of	your	long	-	term	happiness	is	 predict 	 ed 	 	not	by	the	external	world	,	but	by	the	way	your	brain	 process 	 es 	 	the	world	.
and	if	we	change	it	,	if	we	change	our	formula	for	happiness	and	success	,	what	we	can	do	is	change	the	way	that	we	can	then	affect	 re 	 ality 	 	.
what	we	found	is	that	 on 	 ly 	 	25	percent	of	job	 success 	 es 	 	are	 predict 	 ed 	 	by	i.q	.
75	percent	of	job	 success 	 es 	 	are	 predict 	 ed 	 	by	your	 optim 	 ism 	 	 level 	 s 	 	,	your	social	support	and	your	ability	to	see	stress	 a 	 s 	 	a	 challeng 	 e 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 a 	 s 	 	a	threat	.
i	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	a	 board 	 ing 	 	school	up	in	new	england	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	most	 pre 	 stig 	 ious 	 	 board 	 ing 	 	school	,	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	 al 	 ready 	 	know	that	.
so	every	year	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	just	 teach 	 ing 	 	our	 student 	 s 	 	,	we	 al 	 so 	 	have	a	 well 	 ness 	 	week	.
and	we	're	so	 excit 	 ed 	 	.	monday	night	we	have	the	world	's	 lead 	 ing 	 	expert	coming	in	to	speak	about	adolescent	 depress 	 ion 	 	.
tuesday	night	it	's	school	violence	and	 bull 	 y 	 ing 	 	.
wednesday	night	is	eating	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	.
thursday	night	is	elicit	drug	use	.
and	friday	night	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	decide	between	 risk 	 y 	 	 s 	 ex 	 	or	happiness	.	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	that	's	most	people	's	friday	 night 	 s 	 	.	``	which	i	'm	glad	you	 like 	 d 	 	,	but	they	did	not	like	that	at	all	.
silence	on	the	phone	.
and	 in 	 to 	 	the	silence	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'd	be	happy	to	speak	at	your	school	,	but	just	so	you	know	,	that	's	not	a	 well 	 ness 	 	week	,	that	's	a	 sick 	 ness 	 	week	.
what	you	've	 d 	 one 	 	is	you	've	 out 	 lined 	 	all	the	negative	 thing 	 s 	 	that	can	happen	,	but	not	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	the	positive	.	``	the	 ab 	 s 	 ence 	 	of	disease	is	not	health	.
here	's	how	we	get	to	health	:	we	need	to	reverse	the	formula	for	happiness	and	success	.
in	the	last	three	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	've	 travel 	 ed 	 	to	45	different	 count 	 ries 	 	,	 work 	 ing 	 	with	 school 	 s 	 	and	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	in	the	 mid 	 st 	 	of	an	economic	 down 	 turn 	 	.
and	what	i	found	is	that	most	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	and	 school 	 s 	 	follow	a	formula	for	success	,	which	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	if	i	work	 hard 	 er 	 	,	i	'll	be	more	 success 	 ful 	 	.
and	if	i	'm	more	 success 	 ful 	 	,	then	i	'll	be	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	.
that	 under 	 gird 	 s 	 	most	of	our	 parent 	 ing 	 	 style 	 s 	 	,	our	 man 	 aging 	 	 style 	 s 	 	,	the	way	that	we	 motiv 	 ate 	 	our	behavior	.
and	the	problem	is	it	's	 scientific 	 ally 	 	broken	and	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	for	two	 reason 	 s 	 	.
first	,	every	time	your	brain	 ha 	 s 	 	a	success	,	you	just	 change 	 d 	 	the	 goal 	 post 	 	of	what	success	 look 	 ed 	 	like	.
you	got	good	 grade 	 s 	 	,	now	you	have	to	get	better	 grade 	 s 	 	,	you	got	 in 	 to 	 	a	good	school	and	after	you	get	 in 	 to 	 	a	better	school	,	you	got	a	good	job	,	now	you	have	to	get	a	better	job	,	you	hit	your	 sale 	 s 	 	target	,	we	're	going	to	change	your	 sale 	 s 	 	target	.
and	if	happiness	is	on	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	side	of	success	,	your	brain	never	 get 	 s 	 	there	.
what	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	is	we	've	 push 	 ed 	 	happiness	over	the	cognitive	horizon	 a 	 s 	 	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
and	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	we	think	we	have	to	be	 success 	 ful 	 	,	then	we	'll	be	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	.
but	the	real	problem	is	our	 brain 	 s 	 	work	in	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	order	.
if	you	can	raise	 some 	 body 	 	's	level	of	 posit 	 ivity 	 	in	the	present	,	then	 the 	 ir 	 	brain	 experience 	 s 	 	what	we	now	call	a	happiness	advantage	,	which	is	your	brain	at	positive	 perform 	 s 	 	 significant 	 ly 	 	better	than	it	 do 	 es 	 	at	negative	,	neutral	or	 stress 	 ed 	 	.
your	 intellig 	 ence 	 	 rise 	 s 	 	,	your	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	 rise 	 s 	 	,	your	energy	 level 	 s 	 	rise	.
in	fact	,	what	we	've	found	is	that	every	single	business	 out 	 come 	 	 improve 	 s 	 	.
your	brain	at	positive	is	31	percent	more	productive	than	your	brain	at	negative	,	neutral	or	 stress 	 ed 	 	.
you	're	37	percent	better	at	 sale 	 s 	 	.
 doctor 	 s 	 	are	19	percent	 fast 	 er 	 	,	more	accurate	at	coming	up	with	the	correct	 diagnos 	 is 	 	when	positive	 in 	 stead 	 	of	negative	,	neutral	or	 stress 	 ed 	 	.
which	 mean 	 s 	 	we	can	reverse	the	formula	.
if	we	can	find	a	way	of	 be 	 coming 	 	positive	in	the	present	,	then	our	 brain 	 s 	 	work	even	more	 success 	 fully 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	're	able	to	work	 hard 	 er 	 	,	 fast 	 er 	 	and	more	 intelligent 	 ly 	 	.
what	we	need	to	be	able	to	do	is	to	reverse	 th 	 is 	 	formula	so	we	can	start	to	see	what	our	 brain 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 cap 	 able 	 	of	.
 be 	 cause 	 	dopamine	,	which	 flood 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	your	system	when	you	're	positive	,	 ha 	 s 	 	two	 function 	 s 	 	.
not	 on 	 ly 	 	 do 	 es 	 	it	make	you	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	on	all	of	the	 learn 	 ing 	 	 center 	 s 	 	in	your	brain	 allow 	 ing 	 	you	to	adapt	to	the	world	in	a	different	way	.
we	've	found	that	there	are	ways	that	you	can	train	your	brain	to	be	able	to	 be 	 come 	 	more	positive	.
in	just	a	two	-	minute	span	of	time	 d 	 one 	 	for	21	 day 	 s 	 	in	a	row	,	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	 re 	 wire 	 	your	brain	,	 allow 	 ing 	 	your	brain	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	work	more	 optimist 	 ically 	 	and	more	 success 	 fully 	 	.
we	've	 d 	 one 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	in	research	now	in	every	single	company	that	i	've	 work 	 ed 	 	with	,	 get 	 ting 	 	them	to	write	down	three	new	 thing 	 s 	 	that	they	're	 grat 	 e 	 ful 	 	for	for	21	 day 	 s 	 	in	a	row	,	three	new	 thing 	 s 	 	each	day	.
and	at	the	end	of	that	,	 the 	 ir 	 	brain	 start 	 s 	 	to	retain	a	pattern	of	 s 	 canning 	 	the	world	,	not	for	the	negative	,	but	for	the	positive	first	.
 journal 	 ing 	 	about	one	positive	experience	you	've	had	over	the	past	24	 hour 	 s 	 	 allow 	 s 	 	your	brain	to	 re 	 live 	 	it	.
 exercis 	 e 	 	 teach 	 es 	 	your	brain	that	your	behavior	 matter 	 s 	 	.
we	find	that	 medit 	 ation 	 	 allow 	 s 	 	your	brain	to	get	over	the	cultural	adhd	that	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	creating	by	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	 multi 	 ple 	 	 task 	 s 	 	at	once	and	 allow 	 s 	 	our	 brain 	 s 	 	to	focus	on	the	task	at	hand	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	random	 act 	 s 	 	of	 kind 	 ness 	 	are	conscious	 act 	 s 	 	of	 kind 	 ness 	 	.
we	get	people	,	when	they	open	up	 the 	 ir 	 	 in 	 box 	 	,	to	write	one	positive	email	 p 	 raising 	 	or	 thank 	 ing 	 	 some 	 body 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	social	support	network	.
and	by	 do 	 ing 	 	these	 activ 	 ities 	 	and	by	training	your	brain	just	like	we	train	our	bodies	,	what	we	've	found	is	we	can	reverse	the	formula	for	happiness	and	success	,	and	in	 do 	 ing 	 	so	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	create	 ripple 	 s 	 	of	 posit 	 ivity 	 	,	but	create	a	real	revolution	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
