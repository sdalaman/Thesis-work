 th 	 is 	 	sound	,	 th 	 is 	 	smell	,	 th 	 is 	 	sight	all	 re 	 mind 	 	me	of	the	 camp 	 fire 	 s 	 	of	my	 child 	 hood 	 	,	when	 any 	 one 	 	could	 be 	 come 	 	a	 story 	 teller 	 	in	front	of	the	 danc 	 ing 	 	 flame 	 s 	 	.
there	was	 th 	 is 	 	 won 	 dr 	 ous 	 	 end 	 ing 	 	when	people	and	fire	fell	 a 	 sleep 	 	 al 	 most 	 	in	 un 	 ison 	 	.
it	was	 dream 	 ing 	 	time	.
now	my	story	 ha 	 s 	 	a	lot	to	do	with	 dream 	 ing 	 	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	i	'm	known	to	make	my	 dream 	 s 	 	come	true	.
last	year	,	i	 create 	 d 	 	a	one	-	man	show	.
for	an	hour	and	a	half	i	 share 	 d 	 	with	the	audience	a	 life 	 time 	 	of	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	,	how	i	pursue	 perfect 	 ion 	 	,	how	i	cheat	the	 im 	 possible 	 	.
and	then	ted	 challeng 	 ed 	 	me	:	``	philippe	,	can	you	shrink	 th 	 is 	 	 life 	 time 	 	to	18	 minute 	 s 	 	?	``	eighteen	 minute 	 s 	 	,	 clear 	 ly 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	.
but	here	i	am	.
one	solution	was	to	 rehears 	 e 	 	a	machine	gun	 deliver 	 y 	 	in	which	every	syllable	,	every	second	will	have	 it 	 s 	 	 import 	 ance 	 	and	hope	to	god	the	audience	will	be	able	to	follow	me	.
no	,	no	,	no	.
no	,	the	best	way	for	me	to	start	is	to	pay	my	 respect 	 s 	 	to	the	 god 	 s 	 	of	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	.
so	 pleas 	 e 	 	join	me	for	a	minute	of	silence	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	i	 cheat 	 ed 	 	,	it	was	a	mere	20	 second 	 s 	 	.
but	 he 	 y 	 	,	we	're	on	ted	time	.
when	i	was	six	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	i	fell	in	love	with	magic	.
for	christmas	i	got	a	magic	box	and	a	 ver 	 y 	 	old	book	on	card	 manipul 	 ation 	 	.
 some 	 how 	 	i	was	more	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 pur 	 e 	 	 manipul 	 ation 	 	than	in	all	the	 s 	 il 	 ly 	 	little	 trick 	 s 	 	in	the	box	.
so	i	 look 	 ed 	 	in	the	book	for	the	most	difficult	move	,	and	it	was	 th 	 is 	 	.
now	i	'm	not	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	share	that	with	you	,	but	i	have	to	show	you	the	card	is	 hid 	 den 	 	in	the	back	of	the	hand	.
now	that	 manipul 	 ation 	 	was	broken	down	 in 	 to 	 	seven	 move 	 s 	 	 de 	 scribed 	 	over	seven	 page 	 s 	 	.
one	,	two	,	three	,	four	,	five	,	six	and	seven	.
and	let	me	show	you	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
the	 card 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 big 	 ger 	 	than	my	 hand 	 s 	 	.
two	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	six	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	i	'm	able	to	do	one	,	two	,	three	,	four	,	five	,	six	,	seven	.
and	i	go	to	see	a	famous	 magic 	 ian 	 	and	 proud 	 ly 	 	ask	him	,	``	well	what	do	you	think	?	``	six	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
the	 magic 	 ian 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	at	me	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	disaster	.
you	can	not	do	that	in	two	 second 	 s 	 	and	have	a	minuscule	part	of	the	card	 show 	 ing 	 	.
for	the	move	to	be	professional	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	less	than	one	second	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	perfect	.	``
two	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	one	--	zoop	.
and	i	'm	not	 cheat 	 ing 	 	.	it	's	in	the	back	.	it	's	perfect	.
 pass 	 ion 	 	is	the	 mot 	 to 	 	of	all	my	 action 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	'm	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	magic	,	 jug 	 gling 	 	is	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	 repeat 	 ed 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	great	way	to	 acquir 	 e 	 	 dexter 	 ity 	 	and	 coordi 	 nation 	 	.
now	i	had	long	 admire 	 d 	 	how	fast	and	 fluid 	 ly 	 	 juggler 	 s 	 	make	 object 	 s 	 	fly	.
so	that	's	it	.	i	'm	14	;	i	'm	 be 	 coming 	 	a	juggler	.
i	befriend	a	young	juggler	in	a	 jug 	 gling 	 	 trou 	 pe 	 	,	and	he	 agree 	 s 	 	to	sell	me	three	 club 	 s 	 	.
but	in	america	you	have	to	explain	.	what	are	 club 	 s 	 	?
 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	golf	.
they	are	 t 	 hose 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	oblong	 object 	 s 	 	,	but	 quit 	 e 	 	difficult	to	make	.
they	have	to	be	 precise 	 ly 	 	lathed	.
oh	,	when	i	was	 buy 	 ing 	 	the	 club 	 s 	 	,	 some 	 how 	 	the	young	juggler	was	 hid 	 ing 	 	from	the	 other 	 s 	 	.
well	i	did	n't	think	much	of	it	at	the	time	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	here	i	was	 progress 	 ing 	 	with	my	new	 club 	 s 	 	.
but	i	could	not	understand	.
i	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	fast	,	but	i	was	not	fluid	at	all	.
the	 club 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 es 	 cap 	 ing 	 	me	at	each	throw	.
and	i	was	 try 	 ing 	 	 constant 	 ly 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	them	back	to	me	.
 un 	 til 	 	one	day	i	 practice 	 d 	 	in	front	of	francis	brunn	,	the	world	's	 great 	 est 	 	juggler	.
and	he	was	 frown 	 ing 	 	.
and	he	 final 	 ly 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	``	can	i	see	 t 	 hose 	 	?	``	so	i	 proud 	 ly 	 	 show 	 ed 	 	him	my	 club 	 s 	 	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	philippe	,	you	have	 be 	 en 	 	had	.
these	are	 reject 	 s 	 	.	they	are	 complete 	 ly 	 	out	of	 align 	 ment 	 	.
they	are	 im 	 possible 	 	to	 jug 	 gle 	 	.	``
 ten 	 a 	 city 	 	is	how	i	 ke 	 pt 	 	at	it	against	all	 odd 	 s 	 	.
so	i	went	to	the	circus	to	see	more	 magic 	 ians 	 	,	more	 juggler 	 s 	 	,	and	i	saw	--	oh	no	,	no	,	no	,	i	did	n't	see	.
it	was	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	;	i	heard	.
i	heard	about	 t 	 hose 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	men	and	women	who	walk	on	thin	air	--	the	high	-	wire	 walk 	 ers 	 	.
now	i	have	 be 	 en 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	with	 rope 	 s 	 	and	 climb 	 ing 	 	all	my	 child 	 hood 	 	,	so	that	's	it	.	i	'm	16	;	i	'm	 be 	 coming 	 	a	wire	 walk 	 er 	 	.
i	found	two	 tree 	 s 	 	--	but	not	any	kind	of	 tree 	 s 	 	,	 tree 	 s 	 	with	character	--	and	then	a	 ver 	 y 	 	long	rope	.
and	i	put	the	rope	around	and	around	and	around	and	around	and	around	till	i	had	no	more	rope	.
now	i	have	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 rope 	 s 	 	parallel	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	get	a	pair	of	 pli 	 ers 	 	and	some	coat	 hang 	 ers 	 	,	and	i	gather	them	together	in	some	kind	of	ropey	path	.
so	i	just	 create 	 d 	 	the	widest	tightrope	in	the	world	.
what	did	i	need	?	i	 need 	 ed 	 	the	widest	 shoe 	 s 	 	in	the	world	.
so	i	found	some	enormous	,	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	,	giant	ski	 boot 	 s 	 	and	then	wobbly	,	wobbly	i	get	on	the	 rope 	 s 	 	.
well	 with 	 in 	 	a	few	 day 	 s 	 	i	'm	able	to	do	one	 cross 	 ing 	 	.
so	i	cut	one	rope	off	.
and	the	next	day	one	rope	off	.
and	a	few	 day 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	i	was	 p 	 rac 	 tic 	 ing 	 	on	a	single	tightrope	.
now	you	can	imagine	at	that	time	i	had	to	 s 	 witch 	 	the	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	 boot 	 s 	 	for	some	 slip 	 per 	 s 	 	.
so	that	is	how	--	in	case	there	are	people	here	in	the	audience	who	would	like	to	try	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	not	to	learn	wire	 walk 	 ing 	 	.
 intuit 	 ion 	 	is	a	tool	essential	in	my	life	.
in	the	 mean 	 time 	 	,	i	am	 be 	 ing 	 	 throw 	 n 	 	out	of	five	different	 school 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	,	i	am	my	own	teacher	,	 progress 	 ing 	 	in	my	new	art	and	 be 	 coming 	 	a	street	juggler	.
on	the	high	wire	,	 with 	 in 	 	 month 	 s 	 	,	i	'm	able	to	master	all	the	 trick 	 s 	 	they	do	in	the	circus	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	i	am	not	satisfied	.
i	was	 start 	 ing 	 	to	invent	my	own	 move 	 s 	 	and	 br 	 ing 	 	them	to	 perfect 	 ion 	 	.
but	 no 	 body 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	hire	me	.
so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 put 	 ting 	 	a	wire	up	in	secret	and	 perform 	 ing 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 per 	 mission 	 	.
notre	dame	,	the	sydney	harbor	bridge	,	the	world	trade	center	.
and	i	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	certitude	,	a	faith	that	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	me	that	i	will	get	 safe 	 ly 	 	to	the	other	side	.
if	not	,	i	will	never	do	that	first	step	.
well	 non 	 e 	 the 	 less 	 	,	on	the	top	of	the	world	trade	center	my	first	step	was	 terrify 	 ing 	 	.
all	of	a	sudden	the	density	of	the	air	is	no	 long 	 er 	 	the	same	.
manhattan	no	 long 	 er 	 	 spread 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 in 	 fin 	 ity 	 	.
the	murmur	of	the	city	 dis 	 solve 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	squall	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 chill 	 ing 	 	power	i	no	 long 	 er 	 	feel	.
i	lift	the	 balanc 	 ing 	 	pole	.	i	approach	the	edge	.
i	step	over	the	beam	.
i	put	my	left	foot	on	the	cable	,	the	weight	of	my	body	raised	on	my	right	leg	 anchor 	 ed 	 	to	the	flank	of	the	building	.
 s 	 hall 	 	i	ever	so	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	shift	my	weight	to	the	left	?
my	right	leg	will	be	unburdened	,	my	right	foot	will	 free 	 ly 	 	meet	the	wire	.
on	one	side	,	a	mass	of	a	mountain	,	a	life	i	know	.
on	the	other	,	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	of	the	 cloud 	 s 	 	,	so	full	of	 un 	 known 	 	we	think	it	's	empty	.
at	my	feet	,	the	path	to	the	north	tower	--	60	 yard 	 s 	 	of	wire	rope	.
it	's	a	straight	line	,	which	 s 	 ag 	 s 	 	,	which	sways	,	which	 vib 	 rates 	 	,	which	 roll 	 s 	 	on	 it 	 self 	 	,	which	is	ice	,	which	is	three	 ton 	 s 	 	tight	,	ready	to	explode	,	ready	to	swallow	me	.
an	inner	howl	assails	me	,	the	wild	 long 	 ing 	 	to	flee	.
but	it	is	too	late	.
the	wire	is	ready	.
 decis 	 ively 	 	my	other	foot	 set 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	onto	the	cable	.
faith	is	what	 replace 	 s 	 	doubt	in	my	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	.
so	after	the	walk	people	ask	me	,	``	how	can	you	top	that	?	``	well	i	did	n't	have	that	problem	.
i	was	not	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 collect 	 ing 	 	the	 gig 	 antic 	 	,	in	 break 	 ing 	 	 record 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	i	put	my	world	trade	center	 cross 	 ing 	 	at	the	same	 art 	 istic 	 	level	 a 	 s 	 	some	of	my	 small 	 er 	 	 walk 	 s 	 	--	or	some	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	type	of	performance	.
let	's	see	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	my	street	 jug 	 gling 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
so	each	time	i	draw	my	circle	of	chalk	on	the	 pave 	 ment 	 	and	enter	 a 	 s 	 	the	 improv 	 is 	 ing 	 	 com 	 ic 	 	silent	character	i	 create 	 d 	 	45	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	am	 a 	 s 	 	happy	 a 	 s 	 	when	i	am	in	the	 cloud 	 s 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	here	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	the	street	.
so	i	can	not	street	 jug 	 gle 	 	here	,	you	understand	.
so	you	do	n't	want	me	to	street	 jug 	 gle 	 	here	,	right	?
you	know	that	,	right	?
you	do	n't	want	me	to	 jug 	 gle 	 	,	right	?
thank	you	.	thank	you	.
each	time	i	street	 jug 	 gle 	 	i	use	improvisation	.
now	improvisation	is	 empower 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 welcome 	 s 	 	the	 un 	 known 	 	.
and	since	what	's	 im 	 possible 	 	is	 al 	 ways 	 	 un 	 known 	 	,	it	 allow 	 s 	 	me	to	 believ 	 e 	 	i	can	cheat	the	 im 	 possible 	 	.
now	i	have	 d 	 one 	 	the	 im 	 possible 	 	not	once	,	but	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	.
so	what	should	i	share	?	oh	,	i	know	.	israel	.
some	 year 	 s 	 	ago	i	was	 invit 	 ed 	 	to	open	the	israel	 fest 	 ival 	 	by	a	high	-	wire	walk	.
and	i	chose	to	put	my	wire	between	the	arab	 quarter 	 s 	 	and	the	jewish	quarter	of	jerusalem	over	the	ben	hinnom	 val 	 ley 	 	.
and	i	thought	it	would	be	 in 	 credible 	 	if	in	the	middle	of	the	wire	i	 stop 	 ped 	 	and	,	like	a	 magic 	 ian 	 	,	i	produce	a	dove	and	 s 	 end 	 	her	in	the	sky	 a 	 s 	 	a	living	symbol	of	peace	.
well	now	i	must	say	,	it	was	a	little	bit	hard	to	find	a	dove	in	israel	,	but	i	got	one	.
and	in	my	hotel	room	,	each	time	i	 practice 	 d 	 	making	it	appear	and	 throw 	 ing 	 	her	in	the	air	,	she	would	graze	the	wall	and	end	up	on	the	bed	.
so	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	now	it	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	the	room	is	too	small	.
i	mean	,	a	bird	 need 	 s 	 	space	to	fly	.
it	will	go	 perfect 	 ly 	 	on	the	day	of	the	walk	.
now	 come 	 s 	 	the	day	of	the	walk	.
 eight 	 y 	 	thousand	people	spread	over	the	entire	 val 	 ley 	 	.
the	mayor	of	jerusalem	,	 ted 	 dy 	 	kollek	,	 come 	 s 	 	to	wish	me	the	best	.
but	he	 seem 	 ed 	 	nervous	.
there	was	tension	in	my	wire	,	but	i	 al 	 so 	 	could	feel	tension	on	the	ground	.
 be 	 cause 	 	all	 t 	 hose 	 	people	 we 	 re 	 	made	up	of	people	who	,	for	the	most	part	,	 consider 	 ed 	 	each	other	 ene 	 mies 	 	.
so	i	start	the	walk	.	 every 	 thing 	 	is	fine	.
i	stop	in	the	middle	.
i	make	the	dove	appear	.
people	applaud	in	 de 	 light 	 	.
and	then	in	the	most	 magnific 	 ent 	 	 gest 	 ure 	 	,	i	 s 	 end 	 	the	bird	of	peace	 in 	 to 	 	the	azure	.
but	the	bird	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 fly 	 ing 	 	away	,	 go 	 es 	 	flop	,	flop	,	flop	and	 land 	 s 	 	on	my	head	.
and	people	 s 	 cream 	 	.
so	i	grab	the	dove	,	and	for	the	second	time	i	 s 	 end 	 	her	in	the	air	.
but	the	dove	,	who	 obvious 	 ly 	 	did	n't	go	to	 fly 	 ing 	 	school	,	 go 	 es 	 	flop	,	flop	,	flop	and	 end 	 s 	 	up	at	the	end	of	my	 balanc 	 ing 	 	pole	.
you	laugh	,	you	laugh	.	but	 he 	 y 	 	.
i	 s 	 it 	 	down	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	.	it	's	a	 re 	 flex 	 	of	wire	 walk 	 ers 	 	.
now	in	the	 mean 	 time 	 	,	the	audience	,	they	go	crazy	.
they	must	think	 th 	 is 	 	guy	with	 th 	 is 	 	dove	,	he	must	have	 s 	 pent 	 	 year 	 s 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	with	him	.
what	a	 gen 	 ius 	 	,	what	a	professional	.
so	i	take	a	bow	.	i	 salut 	 e 	 	with	my	hand	.
and	at	the	end	i	bang	my	hand	against	the	pole	to	 dis 	 lodge 	 	the	bird	.
now	the	dove	,	who	,	now	you	know	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	can	not	fly	,	 do 	 es 	 	for	the	third	time	a	little	flop	,	flop	,	flop	and	 end 	 s 	 	up	on	the	wire	 be 	 hind 	 	me	.
and	the	entire	 val 	 ley 	 	 go 	 es 	 	crazy	.
now	but	hold	on	,	i	'm	not	 finish 	 ed 	 	.
so	now	i	'm	like	50	 yard 	 s 	 	from	my	 arriv 	 al 	 	and	i	'm	 exhaust 	 ed 	 	,	so	my	 step 	 s 	 	are	 s 	 low 	 	.
and	 some 	 thing 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
 some 	 body 	 	 some 	 where 	 	,	a	group	of	people	,	 start 	 s 	 	 clap 	 ping 	 	in	rhythm	with	my	 step 	 s 	 	.
and	 with 	 in 	 	 second 	 s 	 	the	entire	 val 	 ley 	 	is	 applaud 	 ing 	 	in	 un 	 ison 	 	with	each	of	my	 step 	 s 	 	.
but	not	an	 app 	 laus 	 e 	 	of	 de 	 light 	 	like	before	,	an	 app 	 laus 	 e 	 	 encourag 	 ement 	 	.
for	a	moment	,	the	entire	crowd	had	 for 	 gotten 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	.
they	had	 be 	 come 	 	one	,	 push 	 ing 	 	me	to	triumph	.
i	want	you	just	for	a	second	to	experience	 th 	 is 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	human	 sym 	 phony 	 	.
so	let	's	say	i	am	here	and	the	chair	is	my	 arriv 	 al 	 	.
so	i	walk	,	you	clap	,	 every 	 body 	 	in	 un 	 ison 	 	.
so	after	the	walk	,	 ted 	 dy 	 	and	i	 be 	 come 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	.
and	he	 tell 	 s 	 	me	,	he	 ha 	 s 	 	on	his	desk	a	picture	of	me	in	the	middle	of	the	wire	with	a	dove	on	my	head	.
he	did	n't	know	the	true	story	.
and	 when 	 ever 	 	he	's	 daunt 	 ed 	 	by	an	 im 	 possible 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	to	solve	in	 th 	 is 	 	hard	-	to	-	manage	city	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	giving	up	,	he	 look 	 s 	 	at	the	picture	and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	if	philippe	can	do	that	,	i	can	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	``	and	he	 go 	 es 	 	back	to	work	.
inspiration	.
by	inspiring	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	we	inspire	 other 	 s 	 	.
i	will	never	forget	 th 	 is 	 	music	,	and	i	hope	now	 n 	 either 	 	will	you	.
 pleas 	 e 	 	take	 th 	 is 	 	music	with	you	home	,	and	start	 glu 	 ing 	 	 feather 	 s 	 	to	your	 arm 	 s 	 	and	take	off	and	fly	,	and	look	at	the	world	from	a	different	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	.
and	when	you	see	 mountain 	 s 	 	,	remember	 mountain 	 s 	 	can	be	 move 	 d 	 	.
thank	you	.	thank	you	.
