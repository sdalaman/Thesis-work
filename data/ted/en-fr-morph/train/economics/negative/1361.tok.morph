and	there	is	a	major	shift	coming	on	the	horizon	.
the	catalyst	for	 th 	 is 	 	change	was	the	major	 earth 	 quake 	 	that	 s 	 truck 	 	 ha 	 iti 	 	on	the	12th	of	january	in	2010	.

the	 possibil 	 ities 	 	that	new	digital	 techno 	 logies 	 	are	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	can	help	 human 	 itarian 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	ensure	that	people	's	right	to	information	is	met	,	or	that	they	have	 the 	 ir 	 	right	to	communicate	,	but	i	think	in	the	future	,	 human 	 itarian 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	will	 al 	 so 	 	have	to	 anticip 	 ate 	 	the	right	for	people	to	access	critical	communication	 techno 	 logies 	 	in	order	to	ensure	that	 the 	 ir 	 	 voice 	 s 	 	are	heard	,	that	they	're	 tru 	 ly 	 	 particip 	 ating 	 	,	that	they	're	 tru 	 ly 	 	 empower 	 ed 	 	in	the	 human 	 itarian 	 	world	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	the	elusive	ideal	to	ensure	full	 particip 	 ation 	 	of	people	 affect 	 ed 	 	by	 disaster 	 s 	 	in	the	 human 	 itarian 	 	effort	.
we	now	have	the	 tool 	 s 	 	.	we	now	have	the	 possibil 	 ities 	 	.
there	are	no	more	 reason 	 s 	 	not	to	do	it	.
