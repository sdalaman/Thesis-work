in	the	last	50	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	building	the	 suburb 	 s 	 	with	a	lot	of	 un 	 intend 	 ed 	 	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	and	just	present	a	whole	bunch	of	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 project 	 s 	 	that	i	think	give	us	tremendous	 reason 	 s 	 	to	be	 re 	 ally 	 	 optimist 	 ic 	 	that	the	big	design	and	 develop 	 ment 	 	project	of	the	next	50	 year 	 s 	 	is	going	to	be	 retro 	 fitting 	 	suburbia	.
so	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	 re 	 develop 	 ing 	 	 dy 	 ing 	 	 mall 	 s 	 	or	re	-	 inhabit 	 ing 	 	dead	big	-	box	 store 	 s 	 	or	 re 	 construct 	 ing 	 	 wet 	 land 	 s 	 	out	of	 park 	 ing 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	,	i	think	the	fact	is	the	growing	number	of	empty	and	under	-	 perform 	 ing 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 re 	 tail 	 	,	 s 	 ites 	 	 through 	 out 	 	suburbia	 give 	 s 	 	us	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	tremendous	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	take	our	 l 	 east 	 	-	 sustain 	 able 	 	 land 	 scapes 	 	right	now	and	convert	them	 in 	 to 	 	more	 sustain 	 able 	 	 place 	 s 	 	.
and	in	the	process	,	what	that	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	do	is	to	 re 	 direct 	 	a	lot	more	of	our	growth	back	 in 	 to 	 	 exist 	 ing 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	that	could	use	a	boost	,	and	have	the	 infra 	 structure 	 	in	place	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 continu 	 ing 	 	to	tear	down	 tree 	 s 	 	and	to	tear	up	the	green	space	out	at	the	 edge 	 s 	 	.
so	why	is	 th 	 is 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	?
i	think	there	are	any	number	of	 reason 	 s 	 	,
and	i	'm	just	going	to	not	get	 in 	 to 	 	detail	but	 ment 	 ion 	 	a	few	.
just	from	the	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	of	climate	change	,	the	average	urban	 d 	 well 	 er 	 	in	the	u.s	.
 ha 	 s 	 	about	one	-	third	the	carbon	 foot 	 print 	 	of	the	average	 sub 	 urban 	 	 d 	 well 	 er 	 	,	 most 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	suburbanites	drive	a	lot	more	,	and	living	in	 detach 	 ed 	 	 building 	 s 	 	,	you	have	that	much	more	 ex 	 terior 	 	surface	to	leak	energy	out	of	.
so	 strict 	 ly 	 	from	the	cities	are	 al 	 ready 	 	 relat 	 ively 	 	green	.
the	big	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	 reduc 	 e 	 	 green 	 house 	 	gas	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	in	 urban 	 izing 	 	the	 suburb 	 s 	 	.
all	that	 driv 	 ing 	 	that	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	out	in	the	 suburb 	 s 	 	,	we	have	 double 	 d 	 	the	amount	of	 mile 	 s 	 	we	drive	.
it	's	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	our	 depend 	 ence 	 	on	foreign	oil	 de 	 spite 	 	the	 gain 	 s 	 	in	fuel	efficiency	.
we	're	just	 driv 	 ing 	 	so	much	more	;	we	have	n't	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	keep	up	 techno 	 logically 	 	.
public	health	is	 an 	 other 	 	reason	to	consider	 retro 	 fitting 	 	.
 research 	 ers 	 	at	the	cdc	and	other	 place 	 s 	 	have	 increasing 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 link 	 ing 	 	 sub 	 urban 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	with	 s 	 ed 	 ent 	 ary 	 	 life 	 style 	 s 	 	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	linked	then	with	the	 ra 	 ther 	 	 alarm 	 ing 	 	,	growing	rates	of	 obes 	 ity 	 	,	 show 	 n 	 	in	these	 map 	 s 	 	here	,	and	that	 obes 	 ity 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 trigger 	 ing 	 	great	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	in	heart	disease	and	diabetes	to	the	point	where	a	child	born	 to 	 day 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	one	-	in	-	three	chance	of	 develop 	 ing 	 	diabetes	.
and	that	rate	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 escal 	 ating 	 	at	the	same	rate	 a 	 s 	 	children	not	 walk 	 ing 	 	to	school	 any 	 more 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	our	 develop 	 ment 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	.
and	then	there	's	 final 	 ly 	 	--	there	's	the	 afford 	 ability 	 	question	.
i	mean	,	how	 afford 	 able 	 	is	it	to	 continu 	 e 	 	to	live	in	suburbia	with	 ris 	 ing 	 	gas	 price 	 s 	 	?
 sub 	 urban 	 	expansion	to	cheap	land	,	for	the	last	50	 year 	 s 	 	--	you	know	the	cheap	land	out	on	the	edge	--	 ha 	 s 	 	 help 	 ed 	 	 generation 	 s 	 	of	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	enjoy	the	american	dream	.
but	 increasing 	 ly 	 	,	the	 saving 	 s 	 	 promise 	 d 	 	by	drive	-	till	-	you	-	 qual 	 ify 	 	 afford 	 ability 	 	--	which	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	our	model	--	 t 	 hose 	 	 saving 	 s 	 	are	 wipe 	 d 	 	out	when	you	consider	the	 transport 	 ation 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	.
for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	here	in	atlanta	,	about	half	of	 house 	 hold 	 s 	 	make	between	$	20,000	and	$	50,000	a	year	,
and	they	are	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	29	percent	of	 the 	 ir 	 	income	on	housing	and	32	percent	on	 transport 	 ation 	 	.
i	mean	,	that	's	2005	 figure 	 s 	 	.
that	's	before	we	got	up	to	the	four	 buck 	 s 	 	a	gallon	.
you	know	,	 non 	 e 	 	of	us	 re 	 ally 	 	tend	to	do	the	math	on	our	 transport 	 ation 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	,
and	they	're	not	going	down	any	time	soon	.
 whet 	 her 	 	you	love	suburbia	's	 leaf 	 y 	 	 pri 	 vac 	 y 	 	or	you	hate	 it 	 s 	 	 soul 	 less 	 	commercial	 strip 	 s 	 	,	there	are	 reason 	 s 	 	why	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	 retro 	 fit 	 	.
but	is	it	practical	?
i	think	it	is	.
june	williamson	and	i	have	 be 	 en 	 	 research 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 top 	 ic 	 	for	over	a	decade	,
and	we	've	found	over	80	 vari 	 ed 	 	 project 	 s 	 	.
but	that	they	're	 re 	 ally 	 	all	market	driven	,
and	what	's	 driv 	 ing 	 	the	market	in	 part 	 icular 	 	--
number	one	--	is	major	 demo 	 graphic 	 	 shift 	 s 	 	.
we	all	tend	to	think	of	suburbia	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	family	-	focused	place	,
but	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	not	the	case	 any 	 more 	 	.
since	2000	,	 al 	 ready 	 	two	-	 third 	 s 	 	of	 house 	 hold 	 s 	 	in	suburbia	did	not	have	 kid 	 s 	 	in	them	.
we	just	have	n't	caught	up	with	the	actual	 real 	 ities 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
the	 reason 	 s 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	have	a	lot	to	with	the	 domin 	 ance 	 	of	the	two	big	 demo 	 graphic 	 	 group 	 s 	 	right	now	:	the	baby	 boom 	 ers 	 	 ret 	 ir 	 ing 	 	--	and	then	there	's	a	gap	,	generation	x	,	which	is	a	small	generation	.
they	're	still	 hav 	 ing 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	--
but	generation	y	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	even	 start 	 ed 	 	hitting	child	-	 rear 	 ing 	 	age	.
they	're	the	other	big	generation	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	that	,	 demo 	 graph 	 ers 	 	predict	that	through	2025	,	75	to	85	percent	of	new	 house 	 hold 	 s 	 	will	not	have	 kid 	 s 	 	in	them	.
and	the	market	research	,	consumer	research	,	 ask 	 ing 	 	the	 boom 	 ers 	 	and	gen	y	what	it	is	they	would	like	,	what	they	would	like	to	live	in	,	 tell 	 s 	 	us	there	is	going	to	be	a	huge	demand	--	and	we	're	 al 	 ready 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	it	--	for	more	urban	 life 	 style 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	suburbia	.
that	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	the	 boom 	 ers 	 	want	to	be	able	to	age	in	place	,	and	gen	y	would	like	to	live	an	urban	 life 	 style 	 	,	but	most	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 job 	 s 	 	will	 continu 	 e 	 	to	be	out	in	suburbia	.
the	other	big	dynamic	of	change	is	the	 she 	 er 	 	performance	of	underperforming	asphalt	.
now	i	keep	 think 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	would	be	a	great	name	for	an	 in 	 die 	 	rock	band	,
but	 develop 	 ers 	 	 general 	 ly 	 	use	it	to	refer	to	 under 	 used 	 	 park 	 ing 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	--
and	suburbia	is	full	of	them	.
when	the	 post 	 war 	 	 suburb 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	first	built	out	on	the	cheap	land	away	from	 down 	 town 	 	,	it	made	sense	to	just	build	surface	 park 	 ing 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	.
but	 t 	 hose 	 	 s 	 ites 	 	have	now	 be 	 en 	 	 leapfrog 	 ged 	 	and	 leapfrog 	 ged 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	've	just	 continu 	 ed 	 	to	sprawl	,
and	they	now	have	a	 relat 	 ively 	 	central	location	.
it	no	 long 	 er 	 	just	 make 	 s 	 	sense	.
that	land	is	more	 valu 	 able 	 	than	just	surface	 park 	 ing 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	.
it	now	 make 	 s 	 	sense	to	go	back	in	,	build	a	deck	and	build	up	on	 t 	 hose 	 	 s 	 ites 	 	.
so	what	do	you	do	with	a	dead	mall	,	dead	 off 	 ice 	 	park	?
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
in	a	 s 	 low 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	like	 our 	 s 	 	,	re	-	inhabitation	is	one	of	the	more	popular	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	to	be	a	dead	mall	in	st.	louis	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	re	-	 inhabit 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	art	-	space	.
it	's	now	home	to	artist	 studio 	 s 	 	,	theater	 group 	 s 	 	,	dance	 trou 	 pe 	 s 	 	.
it	's	not	 pull 	 ing 	 	in	 a 	 s 	 	much	tax	revenue	 a 	 s 	 	it	once	was	,
but	it	's	 serv 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	community	.
it	's	 keep 	 ing 	 	the	 light 	 s 	 	on	.
it	's	 be 	 coming 	 	,	i	think	,	a	 re 	 ally 	 	great	institution	.
other	 mall 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	re	-	 inhabit 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 nurs 	 ing 	 	 home 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 un 	 ive 	 rs 	 ities 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	all	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 off 	 ice 	 	space	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	found	a	lot	of	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	dead	big	-	box	 store 	 s 	 	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	 convert 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	community	-	 serv 	 ing 	 	uses	 a 	 s 	 	well	--	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 school 	 s 	 	,	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 church 	 es 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 lib 	 r 	 aries 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	little	 grocer 	 y 	 	store	,	a	food	lion	 grocer 	 y 	 	store	,	that	is	now	a	public	library	.
in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	,	i	think	,	 do 	 ing 	 	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 adapt 	 ive 	 	 re 	 use 	 	,	they	 to 	 re 	 	up	some	of	the	 park 	 ing 	 	 space 	 s 	 	,	put	in	bioswales	to	collect	and	clean	the	 run 	 off 	 	,	put	in	a	lot	more	 side 	 walk 	 s 	 	to	connect	to	the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 s 	 	.
and	they	've	made	 th 	 is 	 	,	what	was	just	a	store	 a 	 long 	 	a	commercial	strip	,	 in 	 to 	 	a	community	 gather 	 ing 	 	space	.
 th 	 is 	 	one	is	a	little	l	-	shaped	strip	 shop 	 ping 	 	center	in	phoenix	,	arizona	.
 re 	 ally 	 	all	they	did	was	they	 g 	 ave 	 	it	a	fresh	coat	of	bright	paint	,	a	gourmet	 grocer 	 y 	 	,	and	they	put	up	a	restaurant	in	the	old	post	 off 	 ice 	 	.
never	 under 	 estimate 	 	the	power	of	food	to	turn	a	place	around	and	make	it	a	destination	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	so	 success 	 ful 	 	,	they	've	now	taken	over	the	strip	 a 	 cross 	 	the	street	.
the	real	 e 	 state 	 	 ad 	 s 	 	in	the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	all	 ver 	 y 	 	 proud 	 ly 	 	 pro 	 claim 	 	,	``	 walk 	 ing 	 	distance	to	le	grande	 o 	 range 	 	,	``	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 provide 	 d 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	with	what	 socio 	 logists 	 	like	to	call	``	a	third	place	.	``
if	home	is	the	first	place	and	work	is	the	second	place	,	the	third	place	is	where	you	go	to	hang	out	and	build	community	.
and	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	suburbia	is	 be 	 coming 	 	less	 center 	 ed 	 	on	the	family	,	the	family	 house 	 hold 	 s 	 	,	there	's	a	real	 hung 	 er 	 	for	more	third	 place 	 s 	 	.
so	the	most	 dramat 	 ic 	 	retrofits	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	in	the	next	 categor 	 y 	 	,	the	next	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	:	redevelopment	.
now	,	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	boom	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 dramat 	 ic 	 	redevelopment	 project 	 s 	 	where	the	original	building	was	 scrap 	 ed 	 	to	the	ground	and	then	the	whole	 s 	 ite 	 	was	 re 	 built 	 	at	 significant 	 ly 	 	 great 	 er 	 	density	,	a	sort	of	compact	,	walkable	urban	 neighbor 	 hood 	 s 	 	.
but	some	of	them	have	 be 	 en 	 	much	more	 increment 	 al 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	mashpee	 common 	 s 	 	,	the	 old 	 est 	 	 retro 	 fit 	 	that	we	've	found	.
and	it	's	just	 increment 	 ally 	 	,	over	the	last	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	built	 urban 	 ism 	 	on	top	of	 it 	 s 	 	 park 	 ing 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	.
so	the	black	and	white	photo	 show 	 s 	 	the	simple	60	's	strip	 shop 	 ping 	 	center	.
and	then	the	 map 	 s 	 	above	that	show	 it 	 s 	 	 gradu 	 al 	 	 transform 	 ation 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	compact	,	 mix 	 ed 	 	-	use	new	england	village	,	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 plan 	 s 	 	now	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	approved	for	it	to	connect	to	new	 resident 	 ial 	 	 neighbor 	 hood 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	arterials	and	over	to	the	other	side	.
so	,	you	know	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	it	's	 increment 	 al 	 	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	it	's	all	at	once	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	 in 	 fill 	 	project	on	the	 park 	 ing 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	one	of	an	 off 	 ice 	 	park	 out 	 side 	 	of	washington	d.c	.
when	metrorail	 expand 	 ed 	 	transit	 in 	 to 	 	the	 suburb 	 s 	 	and	 open 	 ed 	 	a	station	 near 	 by 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	the	 owner 	 s 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	to	build	a	new	 park 	 ing 	 	deck	and	then	insert	on	top	of	 the 	 ir 	 	surface	 lot 	 s 	 	and	condo	 building 	 s 	 	,	while	 keep 	 ing 	 	the	 exist 	 ing 	 	 off 	 ice 	 	 building 	 s 	 	.
here	is	the	 s 	 ite 	 	in	1940	:
it	was	just	a	little	farm	in	the	village	of	hyattsville	.
by	1980	,	it	had	 be 	 en 	 	subdivided	 in 	 to 	 	a	big	mall	on	one	side	and	the	 off 	 ice 	 	park	on	the	other
and	then	some	 buff 	 er 	 	 s 	 ites 	 	for	a	library	and	a	church	to	the	far	right	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	the	transit	,	the	main	street	and	the	new	housing	have	all	 be 	 en 	 	built	.
 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	i	expect	that	the	 street 	 s 	 	will	 prob 	 ably 	 	extend	through	a	redevelopment	of	the	mall	.
 plan 	 s 	 	have	 al 	 ready 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 announce 	 d 	 	for	a	lot	of	 t 	 hose 	 	garden	 a 	 part 	 ments 	 	above	the	mall	to	be	redeveloped	.
transit	is	a	big	driver	of	retrofits	.
so	here	's	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
you	can	sort	of	see	the	 funk 	 y 	 	new	condo	 building 	 s 	 	in	between	the	 off 	 ice 	 	 building 	 s 	 	and	the	public	space	and	the	new	main	street	.
 th 	 is 	 	one	is	one	of	my	 favor 	 ites 	 	,	belmar	.
i	think	they	 re 	 ally 	 	built	an	 attract 	 ive 	 	place	here	and	have	just	 employ 	 ed 	 	all	-	green	construction	.
there	's	massive	p.v	.	 array 	 s 	 	on	the	 roof 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	wind	 turbine 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	large	mall	on	a	hundred	-	acre	superblock	.
it	's	now	22	walkable	urban	 block 	 s 	 	with	public	 street 	 s 	 	,	two	public	 park 	 s 	 	,	eight	bus	lines	and	a	range	of	housing	 type 	 s 	 	,
and	so	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 give 	 n 	 	lakewood	,	colorado	the	 down 	 town 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	suburb	never	had	.
here	was	the	mall	in	 it 	 s 	 	 he 	 y 	 day 	 	.
they	had	 the 	 ir 	 	prom	in	the	mall	.	they	 love 	 d 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	mall	.
so	here	's	the	 s 	 ite 	 	in	1975	with	the	mall	.
by	1995	,	the	mall	 ha 	 s 	 	 di 	 ed 	 	.
the	 depart 	 ment 	 	store	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 ke 	 pt 	 	--
and	we	found	 th 	 is 	 	was	true	in	 man 	 y 	 	 case 	 s 	 	.
the	 depart 	 ment 	 	 store 	 s 	 	are	multistory	;	they	're	better	built	.
they	're	easy	to	be	re	-	 adapt 	 ed 	 	.
but	the	one	story	stuff	...
that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
so	here	it	is	at	 project 	 ed 	 	build	-	out	.
 th 	 is 	 	project	,	i	think	,	 ha 	 s 	 	great	 connect 	 ivity 	 	to	the	 exist 	 ing 	 	 neighbor 	 hood 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	1,500	 house 	 hold 	 s 	 	with	the	option	of	a	more	urban	 life 	 style 	 	.
it	's	about	two	-	 third 	 s 	 	built	out	right	now	.
here	's	what	the	new	main	street	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	,
and	it	's	 help 	 ed 	 	to	prompt	--	eight	of	the	13	 region 	 al 	 	 mall 	 s 	 	in	denver	have	now	,	or	have	 announce 	 d 	 	 plan 	 s 	 	to	be	,	retrofitted	.
but	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	note	that	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	 retro 	 fitting 	 	is	not	 occur 	 ring 	 	--	no	,	it	's	 pocket 	 s 	 	of	walkability	on	the	 s 	 ites 	 	of	under	-	 perform 	 ing 	 	 proper 	 ties 	 	.
and	so	it	's	giving	people	more	 choice 	 s 	 	,
but	it	's	not	taking	away	 choice 	 s 	 	.
but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	not	 re 	 ally 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	to	just	create	 pocket 	 s 	 	of	walkability	.
you	want	to	 al 	 so 	 	try	to	get	more	 system 	 ic 	 	 transform 	 ation 	 	.
we	need	to	 al 	 so 	 	 retro 	 fit 	 	the	 corridor 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	retrofitted	in	california	.
they	took	the	commercial	strip	 show 	 n 	 	on	the	black	-	and	-	white	 image 	 s 	 	 be 	 low 	 	,	and	they	built	a	boulevard	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	the	main	street	for	 the 	 ir 	 	town	.
and	it	's	 transform 	 ed 	 	from	 be 	 ing 	 	an	 ug 	 ly 	 	,	 un 	 safe 	 	,	 un 	 desir 	 able 	 	address	,	to	 be 	 coming 	 	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	 attract 	 ive 	 	,	 d 	 ign 	 ified 	 	sort	of	good	address	.
i	mean	now	we	're	 hop 	 ing 	 	we	start	to	see	it	;	they	've	 al 	 ready 	 	built	city	hall	,	 attract 	 ed 	 	two	 hotel 	 s 	 	.
i	could	imagine	 beaut 	 iful 	 	housing	going	up	 a 	 long 	 	there	 with 	 out 	 	 tear 	 ing 	 	down	 an 	 other 	 	tree	.
so	there	's	a	lot	of	great	 thing 	 s 	 	,
but	i	'd	love	to	see	more	 corridor 	 s 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 retro 	 fitting 	 	.
but	densification	is	not	going	to	work	 every 	 where 	 	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	re	-	 green 	 ing 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	the	better	answer	.
there	's	a	lot	to	learn	from	 success 	 ful 	 	landbanking	 program 	 s 	 	in	cities	like	flint	,	michigan	.
there	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	 burg 	 eon 	 ing 	 	 sub 	 urban 	 	 farm 	 ing 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	--	sort	of	 vict 	 ory 	 	 garden 	 s 	 	 meet 	 s 	 	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
but	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	one	of	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	re	-	 green 	 ing 	 	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	is	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	 re 	 store 	 	the	local	 eco 	 logy 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	 out 	 side 	 	of	minneapolis	.
when	the	 shop 	 ping 	 	center	 di 	 ed 	 	,	the	city	 resto 	 red 	 	the	 s 	 ite 	 	's	original	 wet 	 land 	 s 	 	,	creating	lakefront	 proper 	 ty 	 	,	which	then	 attract 	 ed 	 	private	 invest 	 ment 	 	,	the	first	private	 invest 	 ment 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	low	-	income	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	in	over	40	 year 	 s 	 	.
so	they	've	 manage 	 d 	 	to	both	 re 	 store 	 	the	local	 eco 	 logy 	 	and	the	local	 eco 	 nomy 	 	at	the	same	time	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	re	-	 green 	 ing 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
it	 al 	 so 	 	 make 	 s 	 	sense	in	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	 market 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	one	in	seattle	is	on	the	 s 	 ite 	 	of	a	mall	 park 	 ing 	 	lot	 ad 	 ja 	 cent 	 	to	a	new	transit	stop	.
and	the	 wav 	 y 	 	line	is	a	path	 a 	 long 	 side 	 	a	creek	that	 ha 	 s 	 	now	 be 	 en 	 	daylit	.
the	creek	had	 be 	 en 	 	culverted	under	the	 park 	 ing 	 	lot	.
but	daylighting	our	creeks	 re 	 ally 	 	 improve 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	water	quality	and	 con 	 trib 	 ution 	 s 	 	to	 habit 	 at 	 	.
so	i	've	 show 	 n 	 	you	some	of	the	first	generation	of	retrofits	.
what	's	next	?
i	think	we	have	three	 challeng 	 es 	 	for	the	future	.
the	first	is	to	plan	 retro 	 fitting 	 	much	more	systemically	at	the	 metro 	 politan 	 	scale	.
we	need	to	be	able	to	target	which	 area 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	should	be	re	-	greened	.
where	should	we	be	 re 	 develop 	 ing 	 	?
and	where	should	we	be	 encourag 	 ing 	 	re	-	inhabitation	?
these	 slide 	 s 	 	just	show	two	 image 	 s 	 	from	a	 large 	 r 	 	project	that	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	that	for	atlanta	.
i	led	a	team	that	was	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	imagine	atlanta	100	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	.
and	we	chose	to	try	to	reverse	sprawl	through	three	simple	 move 	 s 	 	--	expensive	,	but	simple	.
one	,	in	a	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	,	transit	on	all	major	rail	and	road	 corridor 	 s 	 	.
two	,	in	a	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	,	thousand	foot	buffers	on	all	stream	 corridor 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	little	 extrem 	 e 	 	,	but	we	've	got	a	little	water	problem	.
in	a	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	,	 sub 	 division 	 s 	 	that	 simpl 	 y 	 	end	up	too	close	to	water	or	too	far	from	transit	wo	n't	be	 vi 	 able 	 	.
and	so	we	've	 create 	 d 	 	the	eco	-	acre	transfer	-	to	-	transfer	 develop 	 ment 	 	 right 	 s 	 	to	the	transit	 corridor 	 s 	 	and	allow	the	re	-	 green 	 ing 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 form 	 er 	 	 sub 	 division 	 s 	 	for	food	and	energy	production	.
so	the	second	 challeng 	 e 	 	is	to	improve	the	 architect 	 ural 	 	design	quality	of	the	retrofits	.
and	i	close	with	 th 	 is 	 	image	of	 demo 	 cracy 	 	in	action	:
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	protest	that	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	on	a	 retro 	 fit 	 	in	silver	spring	,	maryland	on	an	 astro 	 turf 	 	town	green	.
now	,	retrofits	are	often	 accus 	 ed 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	faux	 down 	 town 	 s 	 	and	instant	 urban 	 ism 	 	,
and	not	 with 	 out 	 	reason	;	you	do	n't	get	much	more	phony	than	an	 astro 	 turf 	 	town	green	.
i	have	to	say	,	these	are	 ver 	 y 	 	hybrid	 place 	 s 	 	.
they	are	new	but	 try 	 ing 	 	to	look	old	.
they	have	urban	streetscapes	,	but	 sub 	 urban 	 	 park 	 ing 	 	 ratio 	 s 	 	.
 the 	 ir 	 	 population 	 s 	 	are	more	 divers 	 e 	 	than	typical	suburbia	,	but	they	're	less	 divers 	 e 	 	than	cities	.
and	they	are	public	 place 	 s 	 	,	but	that	are	 manage 	 d 	 	by	private	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.
and	just	the	surface	 appear 	 ance 	 	are	often	--	like	the	 astro 	 turf 	 	here	--	they	make	me	 win 	 ce 	 	.
so	,	you	know	,	i	mean	i	'm	glad	that	the	 urban 	 ism 	 	is	 do 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	job	.
the	fact	that	a	protest	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 do 	 es 	 	mean	that	the	 lay 	 out 	 	of	the	 block 	 s 	 	,	the	 street 	 s 	 	and	 block 	 s 	 	,	the	 put 	 ting 	 	in	of	public	space	,	 com 	 promise 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	may	be	,	is	still	a	 re 	 ally 	 	great	thing	.
but	we	've	got	to	get	the	 architect 	 ure 	 	better	.
the	final	 challeng 	 e 	 	is	for	all	of	you	.
i	want	you	to	join	the	protest	and	start	 demand 	 ing 	 	more	 sustain 	 able 	 	 sub 	 urban 	 	 place 	 s 	 	--	more	 sustain 	 able 	 	 place 	 s 	 	,	period	.
but	 cultural 	 ly 	 	,	we	tend	to	think	that	 down 	 town 	 s 	 	should	be	dynamic	,	and	we	expect	that	.
but	we	seem	to	have	an	 expect 	 ation 	 	that	the	 suburb 	 s 	 	should	 fore 	 ver 	 	remain	 froze 	 n 	 	in	 what 	 ever 	 	adolescent	form	they	 we 	 re 	 	first	 give 	 n 	 	birth	to	.
it	's	time	to	let	them	grow	up	,
so	i	want	you	to	all	support	the	 zon 	 ing 	 	 change 	 s 	 	,	the	road	 diet 	 s 	 	,	the	 infra 	 structure 	 	 improve 	 ments 	 	and	the	retrofits	that	are	coming	soon	to	a	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	near	you	.
thank	you	.
