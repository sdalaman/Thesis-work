twenty	-	five	-	and	-	a	-	quarter	 year 	 s 	 	ago	i	read	a	 news 	 paper 	 	article	which	 s 	 aid 	 	that	one	day	 syringe 	 s 	 	would	be	one	of	the	major	 cause 	 s 	 	of	the	spread	of	 aid 	 s 	 	,	the	 trans 	 mission 	 	of	 aid 	 s 	 	.
i	thought	 th 	 is 	 	was	 un 	 accept 	 able 	 	.	so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	it	.
 s 	 ad 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	come	true	.	malaria	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	all	know	,	 kill 	 s 	 	 approximate 	 ly 	 	one	million	people	a	year	.
the	 re 	 use 	 	of	 syringe 	 s 	 	now	 exceed 	 s 	 	that	and	 kill 	 s 	 	1.3	million	people	a	year	.
 th 	 is 	 	young	girl	and	her	friend	that	i	met	in	an	 orphan 	 age 	 	in	delhi	 we 	 re 	 	hiv	positive	from	a	syringe	.
and	what	was	so	 s 	 ad 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	story	was	that	once	 the 	 ir 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	had	found	out	--	and	do	n't	forget	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	took	them	to	the	doctor	--	the	 parent 	 s 	 	threw	them	out	on	the	street	.
and	 h 	 ence 	 	they	 end 	 ed 	 	up	in	an	 orphan 	 age 	 	.
and	it	 come 	 s 	 	from	 situ 	 ations 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	where	you	have	either	 skill 	 ed 	 	or	 un 	 skill 	 ed 	 	 practitioner 	 s 	 	,	 blind 	 ly 	 	giving	an	 inject 	 ion 	 	to	 some 	 one 	 	.
and	the	 inject 	 ion 	 	is	so	 valu 	 able 	 	,	that	the	people	 bas 	 ically 	 	trust	the	doctor	,	 be 	 ing 	 	second	to	god	,	which	i	've	heard	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	,	to	do	the	right	thing	.	but	in	fact	they	're	not	.
and	you	can	understand	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	the	 trans 	 mission 	 	problem	between	people	in	high	-	virus	 area 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	video	we	took	 under 	 cover 	 	,	which	 show 	 s 	 	you	,	over	a	half	an	hour	period	,	a	tray	of	 medicine 	 s 	 	of	42	 vial 	 s 	 	,
which	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 deliver 	 ed 	 	with	 on 	 ly 	 	2	 syringe 	 s 	 	in	a	public	hospital	in	india	.
and	over	the	course	of	half	an	hour	,	not	one	syringe	was	 film 	 ed 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 un 	 wrap 	 ped 	 	.
they	 start 	 ed 	 	with	two	and	they	 end 	 ed 	 	with	two	.
and	you	'll	see	,	just	now	,	a	nurse	coming	back	to	the	tray	,	which	is	 the 	 ir 	 	sort	of	modular	station	,	and	dropping	the	syringe	she	's	just	used	back	in	the	tray	for	it	to	be	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	and	used	 aga 	 in 	 	.
so	you	can	imagine	the	scale	of	 th 	 is 	 	problem	.
and	in	fact	in	india	 al 	 one 	 	,	62	percent	of	all	 inject 	 ions 	 	 give 	 n 	 	are	 un 	 safe 	 	.
these	 kid 	 s 	 	in	pakistan	do	n't	go	to	school	.
they	are	 luck 	 y 	 	.	they	 al 	 ready 	 	have	a	job	.
and	that	job	is	that	they	go	around	and	pick	up	 syringe 	 s 	 	from	the	back	of	 hospital 	 s 	 	,	wash	them	,	and	in	the	course	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 pick 	 ing 	 	them	up	they	 inju 	 re 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
and	then	they	 re 	 package 	 	them	and	sell	them	out	on	 market 	 s 	 	for	 liter 	 ally 	 	more	money	than	a	 steril 	 e 	 	syringe	in	the	first	place	,	which	is	 quit 	 e 	 	bizarre	.
in	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	photo	,	 the 	 ir 	 	father	,	while	we	 we 	 re 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	him	,	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	a	syringe	and	 prick 	 ed 	 	his	finger	--	i	do	n't	know	 whet 	 her 	 	you	can	see	the	drop	of	blood	on	the	end	--	and	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	 whip 	 ped 	 	out	a	box	of	 match 	 es 	 	,	lit	one	,	and	 burn 	 ed 	 	the	blood	off	the	end	of	his	finger	,	giving	me	full	assurance	that	that	was	the	way	that	you	 stop 	 ped 	 	the	 trans 	 mission 	 	of	hiv	.
in	 chin 	 a 	 	,	 recycl 	 ing 	 	is	a	major	issue	.
and	they	are	 collect 	 ed 	 	en	mass	--	you	can	see	the	scale	of	it	here	--	and	 sort 	 ed 	 	out	,	by	hand	,	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	right	 s 	 ize 	 s 	 	,	and	then	put	back	out	on	the	street	.
so	 recycl 	 ing 	 	and	 re 	 use 	 	are	the	major	 issue 	 s 	 	here	.
but	there	was	one	 interest 	 ing 	 	anecdote	that	i	found	in	indonesia	.
in	all	 school 	 s 	 	in	indonesia	,	there	is	 usual 	 ly 	 	a	 to 	 y 	 	seller	in	the	 play 	 ground 	 	.
the	 to 	 y 	 	seller	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	had	 syringe 	 s 	 	,	which	they	 usual 	 ly 	 	do	,	next	door	to	the	 dig 	 gers 	 	,	which	is	 obvious 	 ly 	 	what	you	would	expect	.
and	they	use	them	,	in	the	 break 	 s 	 	,	for	water	 pist 	 ol 	 s 	 	.
they	squirt	them	at	each	other	,	which	is	 love 	 ly 	 	and	 innoc 	 ent 	 	.
and	they	are	 hav 	 ing 	 	great	 f 	 un 	 	.
but	they	 al 	 so 	 	drink	from	them	while	they	're	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 break 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	hot	.
and	they	squirt	the	water	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 mouth 	 s 	 	.
and	these	are	used	with	 trace 	 s 	 	of	blood	visible	.
so	we	need	a	better	product	.	and	we	need	better	information	.
and	i	think	,	if	i	can	just	borrow	 th 	 is 	 	camera	,	i	was	going	to	show	you	my	 invent 	 ion 	 	,	which	i	came	up	with	.
so	,	it	's	a	normal	-	looking	syringe	.
you	load	it	up	in	the	normal	way	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	made	on	 exist 	 ing 	 	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	in	14	 factor 	 ies 	 	that	we	 licens 	 e 	 	.
you	give	the	 inject 	 ion 	 	and	then	put	it	down	.
if	 some 	 one 	 	then	tries	to	 re 	 use 	 	it	,	it	 lock 	 s 	 	and	 break 	 s 	 	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	.	thank	you	.
and	it	 cost 	 s 	 	the	same	 a 	 s 	 	a	normal	syringe	.
and	in	 compar 	 ison 	 	,	a	coca	-	 col 	 a 	 	is	10	 time 	 s 	 	the	price	.
and	that	will	stop	 re 	 using 	 	a	syringe	20	or	30	 time 	 s 	 	.
and	i	have	an	information	 char 	 ity 	 	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	huge	scale	amount	of	work	in	india	.
and	we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	proud	of	giving	information	to	people	,
so	that	little	 kid 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	do	n't	do	stupid	 thing 	 s 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
