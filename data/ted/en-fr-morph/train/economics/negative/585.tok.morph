i	want	to	help	you	re	-	perceive	what	 philanthro 	 py 	 	is	,	what	it	could	be	,	and	what	your	relationship	to	it	is	.
and	in	 do 	 ing 	 	that	,	i	want	to	 off 	 er 	 	you	a	vision	,	an	 imagin 	 ed 	 	future	,	if	you	will	,	of	how	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	poet	seamus	heaney	 ha 	 s 	 	put	it	,	``	once	in	a	 life 	 time 	 	the	 long 	 ed 	 	-	for	 tid 	 al 	 	wave	of	justice	can	rise	up	,	and	hope	and	 histo 	 ry 	 	 rhym 	 e 	 	.	``
i	want	to	start	with	these	word	 pair 	 s 	 	here	.
we	all	know	which	side	of	these	we	'd	like	to	be	on	.
when	 philanthro 	 py 	 	was	 re 	 invent 	 ed 	 	a	century	ago	,	when	the	 found 	 ation 	 	form	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 invent 	 ed 	 	,	they	did	n't	think	of	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	on	the	wrong	side	of	these	either	.
in	fact	they	would	never	have	thought	of	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 a 	 s 	 	closed	and	set	in	 the 	 ir 	 	ways	,	 a 	 s 	 	 s 	 low 	 	to	respond	to	new	 challeng 	 es 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	small	and	risk	-	 a 	 verse 	 	.
and	in	fact	they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	.	they	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 invent 	 ing 	 	 char 	 ity 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 time 	 s 	 	,
what	rockefeller	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	business	of	 benevol 	 ence 	 	.	``
but	by	the	end	of	the	20th	century	,	a	new	generation	of	 critic 	 s 	 	and	 reform 	 ers 	 	had	come	to	see	 philanthro 	 py 	 	just	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
the	thing	to	watch	for	 a 	 s 	 	a	global	 philanthro 	 py 	 	industry	 come 	 s 	 	about	--	and	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	--	is	how	the	 aspir 	 ation 	 	is	to	flip	these	old	 assumption 	 s 	 	,
for	 philanthro 	 py 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	open	and	big	and	fast	and	 connect 	 ed 	 	,	in	service	of	the	long	term	.
 th 	 is 	 	 entrepreneur 	 ial 	 	energy	is	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	from	 man 	 y 	 	 quarter 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	driven	and	 propel 	 led 	 	forward	by	new	 lead 	 ers 	 	,	like	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	people	here	,	by	new	 tool 	 s 	 	,	like	the	 one 	 s 	 	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	here	,	and	by	new	 pressure 	 s 	 	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 follow 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	change	for	 quit 	 e 	 	a	while	now	,	and	 particip 	 ating 	 	in	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	report	is	our	main	public	report	.
what	it	 tell 	 s 	 	is	the	story	of	how	 to 	 day 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	could	be	 a 	 s 	 	historic	 a 	 s 	 	100	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
what	i	want	to	do	is	share	some	of	the	 cool 	 est 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	going	on	with	you	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	do	that	,	i	'm	not	going	to	 d 	 well 	 	much	on	the	 ver 	 y 	 	large	 philanthro 	 py 	 	that	 every 	 body 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	 know 	 s 	 	about	--	the	 gate 	 s 	 	or	the	soros	or	the	google	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	what	i	want	to	do	is	talk	about	the	 philanthro 	 py 	 	of	all	of	us	:
the	 democrat 	 ization 	 	of	 philanthro 	 py 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	moment	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	when	the	average	person	 ha 	 s 	 	more	power	than	at	any	time	.
what	i	'm	going	to	do	is	look	at	five	 categor 	 ies 	 	of	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	each	of	which	 challeng 	 es 	 	an	old	assumption	of	 philanthro 	 py 	 	.
the	first	is	mass	 collabor 	 ation 	 	,	 represent 	 ed 	 	here	by	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	may	surprise	you	.
but	remember	,	 philanthro 	 py 	 	is	about	giving	of	time	and	talent	,	not	just	money	.
clay	shirky	,	that	great	 chronic 	 ler 	 	of	 every 	 thing 	 	 network 	 ed 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 capture 	 d 	 	the	assumption	that	 th 	 is 	 	 challeng 	 es 	 	in	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	way	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	have	lived	in	 th 	 is 	 	world	where	little	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 d 	 one 	 	for	love	and	big	 thing 	 s 	 	for	money	.
now	we	have	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	.
 sudden 	 ly 	 	big	 thing 	 s 	 	can	be	 d 	 one 	 	for	love	.	``	watch	,	 th 	 is 	 	spring	,	for	paul	hawken	's	new	book	--
author	and	entrepreneur	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	may	know	about	.
the	book	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 bless 	 ed 	 	 un 	 rest 	 	.	``
and	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	out	,	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	wiki	 s 	 ites 	 	under	the	label	 wis 	 er 	 	,	are	going	to	launch	at	the	same	time	.
 wis 	 er 	 	 stand 	 s 	 	for	world	index	for	social	and	 environment 	 al 	 	 respons 	 ibility 	 	.
 wis 	 er 	 	 set 	 s 	 	out	to	document	,	link	and	empower	what	paul	 call 	 s 	 	the	largest	 move 	 ment 	 	,	and	 fast 	 est 	 	-	growing	 move 	 ment 	 	in	human	 histo 	 ry 	 	:
 human 	 ity 	 	's	 collect 	 ive 	 	 immun 	 e 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	to	 to 	 day 	 	's	 threat 	 s 	 	.
now	,	all	of	these	big	 thing 	 s 	 	for	love	--	 experiment 	 s 	 	--	are	n't	going	to	take	off	.
but	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	do	are	going	to	be	the	 big 	 gest 	 	,	the	most	open	,	the	 fast 	 est 	 	,	the	most	 connect 	 ed 	 	form	of	 philanthro 	 py 	 	in	human	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
second	 categor 	 y 	 	is	 on 	 line 	 	 philanthro 	 py 	 	 market 	 place 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	,	of	course	,	to	 philanthro 	 py 	 	what	ebay	and	amazon	are	to	commerce	.
think	of	it	 a 	 s 	 	peer	-	to	-	peer	 philanthro 	 py 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 challeng 	 es 	 	yet	 an 	 other 	 	assumption	,	which	is	that	 organize 	 d 	 	 philanthro 	 py 	 	is	 on 	 ly 	 	for	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 wealth 	 y 	 	.
take	a	look	,	if	you	have	n't	,	at	donorschoose	.
omidyar	network	 ha 	 s 	 	made	a	big	 invest 	 ment 	 	in	donorschoose	.
it	's	one	of	the	best	known	of	these	new	 market 	 place 	 s 	 	where	a	donor	can	go	straight	 in 	 to 	 	a	 class 	 room 	 	and	connect	with	what	a	teacher	 say 	 s 	 	they	need	.
take	a	look	at	changing	the	present	,	 start 	 ed 	 	by	a	tedster	,	next	time	you	need	a	 wed 	 d 	 ing 	 	present	or	a	 holi 	 day 	 	present	.
giveindia	is	for	a	whole	country	.
and	it	 go 	 es 	 	on	and	on	.
the	third	 categor 	 y 	 	is	 represent 	 ed 	 	by	warren	buffet	,
which	i	call	 aggreg 	 ated 	 	giving	.
it	's	not	just	that	warren	buffet	was	so	 amaz 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 gen 	 er 	 ous 	 	in	that	historic	act	last	summer	.
it	's	that	he	 challeng 	 ed 	 	 an 	 other 	 	assumption	,	that	every	giver	should	have	his	or	her	own	fund	or	 found 	 ation 	 	.
there	are	now	,	 to 	 day 	 	,	so	 man 	 y 	 	new	 fund 	 s 	 	that	are	 aggreg 	 ating 	 	giving	and	 invest 	 ing 	 	,	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	together	people	around	a	common	goal	,	to	think	 big 	 ger 	 	.
one	of	the	best	known	is	acumen	fund	,	led	by	jacqueline	novogratz	,	a	tedster	who	got	a	big	boost	here	at	ted	.
but	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 other 	 s 	 	:	new	profit	in	cambridge	,	new	school	's	venture	fund	in	silicon	 val 	 ley 	 	,	venture	 philanthro 	 py 	 	 partner 	 s 	 	in	washington	,	global	fund	for	women	in	san	francisco	.
take	a	look	at	these	.
these	 fund 	 s 	 	are	to	 philanthro 	 py 	 	what	venture	capital	,	private	 equ 	 ity 	 	,	and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	mutual	 fund 	 s 	 	are	to	 invest 	 ing 	 	,
but	with	a	twist	--	 be 	 cause 	 	often	a	community	 form 	 s 	 	around	these	 fund 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	at	acumen	and	other	 place 	 s 	 	.
now	,	imagine	for	a	second	these	first	three	 type 	 s 	 	of	 experiment 	 s 	 	:	mass	 collabor 	 ation 	 	,	 on 	 line 	 	 market 	 place 	 s 	 	,	 aggreg 	 ated 	 	giving	.
and	understand	how	they	help	us	re	-	perceive	what	 organize 	 d 	 	 philanthro 	 py 	 	is	.
it	's	not	about	 found 	 ations 	 	 necess 	 arily 	 	;	it	's	about	the	rest	of	us	.
and	imagine	the	mash	-	up	,	if	you	will	,	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	in	the	future	,	when	these	 thing 	 s 	 	come	together	in	the	 experiment 	 s 	 	of	the	future	--	imagine	that	 some 	 body 	 	 put 	 s 	 	up	,	say	,	100	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	for	an	inspiring	goal	--	there	 we 	 re 	 	21	 gift 	 s 	 	of	100	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	or	more	in	the	us	last	year	,	not	out	of	the	question	--	but	 on 	 ly 	 	 put 	 s 	 	it	up	if	it	's	 match 	 ed 	 	by	 million 	 s 	 	of	small	 gift 	 s 	 	from	around	the	 glob 	 e 	 	,
 there 	 by 	 	 engag 	 ing 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	people	,	and	building	 vis 	 ibility 	 	and	 engag 	 ing 	 	people	in	the	goal	that	's	 state 	 d 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	look	 quick 	 ly 	 	at	the	fourth	and	fifth	 categor 	 ies 	 	,	which	are	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	 com 	 petition 	 s 	 	and	social	 invest 	 ing 	 	.
they	're	 bet 	 ting 	 	a	visible	 com 	 petition 	 	,	a	prize	,	can	attract	talent	and	money	to	some	of	the	most	difficult	 issue 	 s 	 	,	and	 there 	 by 	 	speed	the	solution	.
 th 	 is 	 	 tackle 	 s 	 	yet	 an 	 other 	 	assumption	,	that	the	giver	and	the	 organ 	 ization 	 	is	at	the	center	,	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	 put 	 ting 	 	the	problem	at	the	center	.
you	can	look	to	these	 innov 	 ators 	 	to	help	us	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	with	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 requir 	 e 	 	 techno 	 logical 	 	or	scientific	solution	.
that	 leav 	 es 	 	the	final	 categor 	 y 	 	,	social	 invest 	 ing 	 	,	which	is	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 any 	 way 	 	,	the	 big 	 gest 	 	of	them	all	,
 represent 	 ed 	 	here	by	xigi	.	net	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	,	of	course	,	 tackle 	 s 	 	the	 big 	 gest 	 	assumption	of	all	,	that	business	is	business	,	and	 philanthro 	 py 	 	is	the	vehicle	of	people	who	want	to	create	change	in	the	world	.
xigi	is	a	new	community	 s 	 ite 	 	that	's	built	by	the	community	,	 link 	 ing 	 	and	mapping	 th 	 is 	 	new	social	capital	market	.
it	 list 	 s 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	1,000	 ent 	 ities 	 	that	are	 off 	 er 	 ing 	 	debt	and	 equ 	 ity 	 	for	social	enterprise	.
so	we	can	look	to	these	 innov 	 ators 	 	to	help	us	remember	that	if	we	can	leverage	even	a	small	amount	of	the	capital	that	 seek 	 s 	 	a	return	,	the	good	that	can	be	driven	could	be	 astonish 	 ing 	 	.
now	,	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	here	is	that	we	're	not	 think 	 ing 	 	our	way	 in 	 to 	 	a	new	way	of	 act 	 ing 	 	;
we	're	 act 	 ing 	 	our	way	 in 	 to 	 	a	new	way	of	 think 	 ing 	 	.
 philanthro 	 py 	 	is	 re 	 organ 	 izing 	 	 it 	 self 	 	before	our	 ver 	 y 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	.
and	even	 th 	 ough 	 	all	of	the	 experiment 	 s 	 	and	all	of	the	big	 giver 	 s 	 	do	n't	yet	fulfill	 th 	 is 	 	 aspir 	 ation 	 	,	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	new	 zeitge 	 ist 	 	:	open	,	big	,	fast	,	 connect 	 ed 	 	,
and	,	let	us	 al 	 so 	 	hope	,	long	.
we	have	got	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	it	is	going	to	take	a	long	time	to	do	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
if	we	do	n't	develop	the	 stam 	 ina 	 	to	stick	with	 thing 	 s 	 	--	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	you	pick	,	stick	with	it	--	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	is	just	going	to	be	,	you	know	,	a	fad	.
but	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 hope 	 ful 	 	.
and	i	'm	 hope 	 ful 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 philanthro 	 py 	 	that	's	 re 	 organ 	 izing 	 	 it 	 self 	 	,
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	whole	other	 port 	 ions 	 	of	the	social	sector	,	and	of	business	,	that	are	 bus 	 y 	 	 challeng 	 ing 	 	``	business	 a 	 s 	 	usual	.	``
and	 every 	 where 	 	i	go	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	here	at	ted	,	i	feel	that	there	is	a	new	moral	 hung 	 er 	 	that	is	growing	.	what	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	is	people	 re 	 ally 	 	 wrestl 	 ing 	 	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	what	is	 th 	 is 	 	new	thing	that	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
 word 	 s 	 	like	``	 philanthro 	 capital 	 ism 	 	,	``	and	``	natural	 capital 	 ism 	 	,	``	and	``	 philanthro 	 entrepreneur 	 	,	``	and	``	venture	 philanthro 	 py 	 	.	``
we	do	n't	have	a	language	for	it	yet	.
 what 	 ever 	 	we	call	it	,	it	's	new	,	it	's	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	and	i	think	it	's	gong	to	 quit 	 e 	 	significant	.
and	that	's	where	my	 imagin 	 ed 	 	future	 come 	 s 	 	in	,
which	i	am	going	to	call	the	social	 s 	 ing 	 ular 	 ity 	 	.
 man 	 y 	 	of	you	will	 real 	 ize 	 	that	i	'm	 rip 	 ping 	 	a	bit	off	of	the	science	fiction	writer	vernor	vinge	's	 not 	 ion 	 	of	a	 techno 	 logical 	 	 s 	 ing 	 ular 	 ity 	 	,	where	a	number	of	 trend 	 s 	 	 accele 	 rate 	 	and	 converg 	 e 	 	and	come	together	to	create	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	a	 shock 	 ing 	 ly 	 	new	 re 	 ality 	 	.
it	may	be	that	the	social	 s 	 ing 	 ular 	 ity 	 	 a 	 head 	 	is	the	one	that	we	fear	the	most	:
a	 converg 	 ence 	 	of	 catastroph 	 es 	 	,	of	 environment 	 al 	 	degradation	,	of	 weapon 	 s 	 	of	mass	 destruct 	 ion 	 	,	of	 pan 	 demic 	 s 	 	,	of	poverty	.
that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	our	ability	to	confront	the	 problem 	 s 	 	that	we	face	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 ke 	 pt 	 	pace	with	our	ability	to	create	them	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	we	've	heard	here	,	it	is	no	 exagge 	 ration 	 	to	say	that	we	hold	the	future	of	our	 civil 	 ization 	 	in	our	 hand 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	never	before	.
the	question	is	,	is	there	a	positive	social	 s 	 ing 	 ular 	 ity 	 	?
is	there	a	 front 	 ier 	 	for	us	of	how	we	live	together	?
our	future	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	to	be	 imagin 	 ed 	 	.
we	can	create	a	future	where	hope	and	 histo 	 ry 	 	 rhym 	 e 	 	.
but	we	have	a	problem	.
our	experience	to	date	,	both	 individual 	 ly 	 	and	 collect 	 ively 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	prepared	us	for	what	we	're	going	to	need	to	do	,	or	who	we	're	going	to	need	to	be	.
we	are	going	to	need	a	new	generation	of	citizen	 lead 	 ers 	 	 will 	 ing 	 	to	commit	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	growing	and	changing	and	 learn 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	possible	.
that	's	why	i	have	one	last	thing	i	want	to	show	you	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	photograph	taken	about	100	 year 	 s 	 	ago	of	my	 grand 	 father 	 	and	great	-	 grand 	 father 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 news 	 paper 	 	 publish 	 er 	 	and	a	 bank 	 er 	 	.
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	great	community	 lead 	 ers 	 	.
and	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	great	 philanthro 	 pist 	 s 	 	.
i	keep	 th 	 is 	 	photograph	close	by	to	me	--
it	's	in	my	 off 	 ice 	 	--
 be 	 cause 	 	i	've	 al 	 ways 	 	felt	a	 mystic 	 al 	 	 connect 	 ion 	 	to	these	two	men	,	both	of	whom	i	never	 k 	 new 	 	.
and	so	,	in	 the 	 ir 	 	honor	,	i	want	to	 off 	 er 	 	you	 th 	 is 	 	blank	slide	.
and	i	want	you	to	imagine	that	 th 	 is 	 	a	photograph	of	you	.
and	i	want	you	to	think	about	the	community	that	you	want	to	be	part	of	creating	.	 what 	 ever 	 	that	 mean 	 s 	 	to	you	.
and	i	want	you	to	imagine	that	it	's	100	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	,	and	your	 grand 	 child 	 	,	or	great	-	 grand 	 child 	 	,	or	niece	or	nephew	or	god	-	child	,	is	looking	at	 th 	 is 	 	photograph	of	you	.
