i	want	to	talk	to	you	a	little	bit	about	user	-	generated	content	.
i	'm	going	to	tell	you	three	 st 	 ories 	 	on	the	way	to	one	argument	that	's	going	to	tell	you	a	little	bit	about	how	we	open	user	-	generated	content	up	for	business	.	1906	.	 th 	 is 	 	man	,	john	philip	sousa	,	 travel 	 ed 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	place	,	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 cap 	 itol 	 	,	to	talk	about	 th 	 is 	 	technology	,	what	he	 call 	 ed 	 	the	,	quote	,	``	 talk 	 ing 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	.	``	sousa	was	not	a	fan	of	the	 talk 	 ing 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	.
``	these	 talk 	 ing 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	are	going	to	ruin	 art 	 istic 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 
of	music	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	.
when	i	was	a	boy	,	in	front	of	every	house	in	the	summer	 even 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	you	would	find	young	people	together
 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	the	 song 	 s 	 	of	the	day	,	or	the	old	 song 	 s 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	you	hear	these	 infer 	 nal 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	going	night	and	day	.
we	will	not	have	a	vocal	 chor 	 d 	 	left	,	``	sousa	 s 	 aid 	 	.
``	the	vocal	 chor 	 d 	 s 	 	will	be	 eliminate 	 d 	 	by	a	process	of	evolution	 a 	 s 	 	was	the	tail	of	man	when	he	came	from	the	ape	.	``	now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	picture	i	want	you	to	focus	on	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	of	culture	.
we	could	 de 	 scribe 	 	it	using	modern	computer	 term 	 in 	 ology 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	read	-	write	culture	.	it	's	a	culture	where	people	 particip 	 ate 	 	in	the	creation
and	the	re	-	creation	of	 the 	 ir 	 	culture	.	in	that	sense	,	it	's	read	-	write	.
sousa	's	fear	was	that	we	would	lose	that	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	these	,	quote	,	``	 infer 	 nal 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	.	``	they	would	take	it	away	.
and	in	 it 	 s 	 	place	,	we	'd	have	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	of	read	-	write	culture	,	what	we	could	call	read	-	 on 	 ly 	 	culture	.
culture	where	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	was	 consum 	 ed 	 	but	the	consumer	is	not	a	creator	.
a	culture	which	is	top	-	down	,	owned	,	where	the	vocal	 chor 	 d 	 s 	 	of	the	 million 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	lost	.
now	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	look	back	at	the	 t 	 went 	 ieth 	 	century	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	in	what	we	think	of	 a 	 s 	 	the	,	quote	,	``	 develop 	 ed 	 	world	``	--
hard	not	to	conclude	that	sousa	was	right	.
never	before	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	human	culture	had	it	 be 	 en 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 professional 	 ized 	 	,	never	before	 a 	 s 	 	 concent 	 rated 	 	.	never	before	 ha 	 s 	 	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	of	the	 million 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 effective 	 ly 	 	 dis 	 place 	 d 	 	,	and	 dis 	 place 	 d 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	these	,	quote	,	``	 infer 	 nal 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	.	``
the	 t 	 went 	 ieth 	 	century	was	that	century	where	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	for	 t 	 hose 	 	 place 	 s 	 	we	know	the	best	,	culture	 move 	 d 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	read	-	write	to	read	-	 on 	 ly 	 	 exist 	 ence 	 	.
so	,	second	.	land	is	a	kind	of	 proper 	 ty 	 	--
it	is	 proper 	 ty 	 	.	it	's	 protect 	 ed 	 	by	law	.
 a 	 s 	 	lord	blackstone	 de 	 scribed 	 	it	,	land	is	 protect 	 ed 	 	by	trespass	law	,	for	most	of	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	trespass	law	,	by	 pre 	 sum 	 ing 	 	it	 protect 	 s 	 	the	land	all	the	way	down	 be 	 low 	 	and	to	an	 in 	 definite 	 	 ex 	 tent 	 	 up 	 ward 	 	.
now	,	that	was	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	system	for	most	of	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	the	 regulat 	 ion 	 	of	land	,	 un 	 til 	 	 th 	 is 	 	technology	came	 a 	 long 	 	,	and	people	 beg 	 an 	 	to	wonder	,	 we 	 re 	 	these	 instrument 	 s 	 	 trespass 	 ers 	 
 a 	 s 	 	they	flew	over	land	 with 	 out 	 	 clear 	 ing 	 	the	 right 	 s 	 	of	the	 farm 	 s 	 	 be 	 low 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	 travel 	 ed 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	country	?
well	,	in	1945	,	 suprem 	 e 	 	court	got	a	chance	to	address	that	question	.
two	 farm 	 ers 	 	,	thomas	lee	and	tinie	causby	,	who	raised	 chicken 	 s 	 	,	had	a	significant	 complain 	 t 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	these	 techno 	 logies 	 	.	the	 complain 	 t 	 	was	that	 the 	 ir 	 	 chicken 	 s 	 	 follow 	 ed 	 	the	pattern	of	the	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	and	flew	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 wall 	 s 	 	of	the	barn
when	the	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	flew	over	the	land	.
and	so	they	 appeal 	 ed 	 	to	lord	blackstone
to	say	these	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 trespass 	 ing 	 	.
since	time	 im 	 memorial 	 	,	the	law	had	 s 	 aid 	 	,	you	ca	n't	fly	over	the	land	 with 	 out 	 	 per 	 mission 	 	of	the	 land 	 owner 	 	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	flight	must	stop	.
well	,	the	 suprem 	 e 	 	court	 consider 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	100	-	 year 	 s 	 	tradition	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	in	an	opinion	written	by	justice	douglas	,	that	the	causbys	must	lose	.
the	 suprem 	 e 	 	court	 s 	 aid 	 	the	 doctri 	 ne 	 	 protect 	 ing 	 	land	all	the	way	to	the	sky	 ha 	 s 	 	no	place	in	the	modern	world	,	 other 	 wise 	 	every	 trans 	 continent 	 al 	 	flight	would	subject	the	 oper 	 ator 	 	to	 count 	 less 	 	trespass	 suit 	 s 	 	.
common	sense	,	a	rare	idea	in	the	law	,	but	here	it	was	.	common	sense	--
--	 revolt 	 s 	 	at	the	idea	.	common	sense	.
 final 	 ly 	 	.	before	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	the	last	great	terror	to	rain	down	on	the	content	industry	was	a	terror	 create 	 d 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	technology	.	 broad 	 cast 	 ing 	 	:
a	new	way	to	spread	content	,	and	 there 	 fore 	 	a	new	battle	over	the	control	of	the	 business 	 es 	 	that	would	spread	content	.
now	,	at	that	time	,	the	 ent 	 ity 	 	,	the	legal	 cart 	 el 	 	,	that	controlled	the	performance	 right 	 s 	 	for	most	of	the	music	that	would	be	 broad 	 cast 	 
using	these	 techno 	 logies 	 	was	ascap	.
they	had	an	exclusive	 licens 	 e 	 	on	the	most	popular	content	,	and	they	 exercis 	 ed 	 	it	in	a	way	that	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	 demonst 	 rate 	 	to	the	 broad 	 cast 	 ers 	 	who	 re 	 ally 	 	was	in	charge	.
so	,	between	1931	and	1939	,	they	raised	rates	by	some	448	percent	,	 un 	 til 	 	the	 broad 	 cast 	 ers 	 	 final 	 ly 	 	got	together
and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	 en 	 ough 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	in	1939	,	a	lawyer	,	sydney	kaye	,	 start 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 broad 	 cast 	 	music	inc.	we	know	it	 a 	 s 	 	bmi	.
and	bmi	was	much	more	 democrat 	 ic 	 	in	the	art	that	it	would	include	 with 	 in 	 	 it 	 s 	 	repertoire	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	african	american	music	for	the	first	time	in	the	repertoire	.
but	most	 import 	 ant 	 	was	that	bmi	took	public	domain	 work 	 s 	 	and	made	 arrange 	 ments 	 	of	them	,	which	they	 g 	 ave 	 	away	for	free
to	 the 	 ir 	 	 sub 	 scribe 	 rs 	 	.	so	that	in	1940	,	when	ascap	 threaten 	 ed 	 	to	double	 the 	 ir 	 	rates	,	the	 major 	 ity 	 	of	 broad 	 cast 	 ers 	 	 s 	 witch 	 ed 	 	to	bmi	.
now	,	ascap	 s 	 aid 	 	they	did	n't	care	.	the	people	will	revolt	,	they	 predict 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 ver 	 y 	 	best	music	was	no	 long 	 er 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	had	 shift 	 ed 	 	to	the	second	best	public	domain	 provide 	 d 	 	by	bmi	.
well	,	they	did	n't	revolt	,	and	in	1941	,	ascap	 crack 	 ed 	 	.
and	the	 import 	 ant 	 	point	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	is	that	even	 th 	 ough 	 	these	 broad 	 cast 	 ers 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 broad 	 cast 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	you	would	call	second	best	,	that	 com 	 petition 	 	was	 en 	 ough 	 	to	break	,	at	that	time	,	 th 	 is 	 	legal	 cart 	 el 	 	over	access	to	music	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	three	 st 	 ories 	 	.	here	's	the	argument	.
in	my	view	,	the	most	significant	thing	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	about	what	 th 	 is 	 	 inter 	 net 	 	is	 do 	 ing 	 	is	 it 	 s 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	 rev 	 ive 	 	the	read	-	write	culture	that	sousa	 romantic 	 ized 	 	.
digital	technology	is	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	for	the	 re 	 viv 	 al 	 	of	these	vocal	 chor 	 d 	 s 	 	that	he	spoke	so	 passionate 	 ly 	 	to	congress	about	.
user	-	generated	content	,	 spread 	 ing 	 	in	 business 	 es 	 	in	 extra 	 ordinari 	 ly 	 	 valu 	 able 	 	ways	like	these	,
 celebr 	 ating 	 	amateur	culture	.
by	which	i	do	n't	mean	 amateur 	 ish 	 	culture	,
i	mean	culture	where	people	produce	for	the	love	of	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	and	not	for	the	money	.	i	mean	the	culture	that	your	 kid 	 s 	 	are	producing	all	the	time	.
for	when	you	think	of	what	sousa	 romantic 	 ized 	 	in	the	young	people	together	,	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	the	 song 	 s 	 	of	the	day	,	of	the	old	 song 	 s 	 	,	you	should	 recogn 	 ize 	 	what	your	 kid 	 s 	 	are	 do 	 ing 	 	right	now	.	taking	the	 song 	 s 	 	of	the	day	and	the	old	 song 	 s 	 
and	 remix 	 ing 	 	them	to	make	them	 some 	 thing 	 	different	.
it	's	how	they	understand	access	to	 th 	 is 	 	culture	.
so	,	let	's	have	some	 ver 	 y 	 	few	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 
to	get	a	sense	of	what	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	here	.
here	's	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 anim 	 e 	 	music	video	,	first	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	taking	 anim 	 e 	 	 capture 	 d 	 	from	 tele 	 vision 	 
re	-	 edit 	 ed 	 	to	music	 track 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	one	you	should	be	--	confidence	.	jesus	 surviv 	 es 	 	.	do	n't	worry	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	best	.
my	love	...
there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	you	in	my	life	...
the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	that	's	bright	...
my	first	love	...
you	're	every	breath	that	i	take	...
you	're	every	step	i	make	...
and	i	...	.
i	want	to	share	all	my	love	with	you	...
no	one	else	will	do	...
and	your	 eye 	 s 	 	...
they	tell	me	how	much	you	care	...
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	remix	,	right	?
and	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	 emphas 	 ize 	 	that	what	 th 	 is 	 	is	not
is	not	what	we	call	,	quote	,	``	 pi 	 racy 	 	.	``
i	'm	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	nor	 just 	 ifying 	 	people	taking	other	people	's	content	in	 whole 	 sale 	 	and	 distribut 	 ing 	 	it	 with 	 out 	 	the	 per 	 mission 	 	of	the	 copy 	 right 	 	owner	.
i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	people	taking	and	 re 	 creating 	 	using	other	people	's	content	,	using	digital	 techno 	 logies 	 	to	say	 thing 	 s 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	.
now	,	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 
is	not	the	 techni 	 que 	 	that	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	here	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	of	course	,	every	 techni 	 que 	 	that	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	here	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 tele 	 vision 	 	and	film	 produce 	 rs 	 	the	 import 	 ance 	 	is	that	that	 techni 	 que 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 democrat 	 ized 	 	.
it	is	now	 any 	 body 	 	with	access	to	a	$	1,500	computer	who	can	take	 sound 	 s 	 	and	 image 	 s 	 	from	the	culture	around	us
and	use	it	to	say	 thing 	 s 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	.
these	 tool 	 s 	 	of	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	have	 be 	 come 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	of	speech	.
it	is	a	 liter 	 acy 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	generation	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	our	 kid 	 s 	 	speak	.
it	is	how	our	 kid 	 s 	 	think	.	it	is	what	your	 kid 	 s 	 	are	 a 	 s 	 	they	 increasing 	 ly 	 	understand	digital	 techno 	 logies 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	relationship	to	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
now	,	in	 respons 	 e 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	new	use	of	culture	using	digital	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	the	law	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 greet 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	sousa	 re 	 viv 	 al 	 	with	 ver 	 y 	 	much	common	sense	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	the	 architect 	 ure 	 	of	 copy 	 right 	 	law	and	the	 architect 	 ure 	 	of	digital	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	they	interact	,	have	 produce 	 d 	 	the	presumption
that	these	 activ 	 ities 	 	are	 il 	 legal 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	if	 copy 	 right 	 	law	at	 it 	 s 	 	core	 regulat 	 es 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	copies	,	then	in	the	digital	world	the	one	fact	we	ca	n't	 es 	 cape 	 	is	that	every	single	use	of	culture	 produce 	 s 	 	a	copy	.
every	single	use	 there 	 fore 	 	 requir 	 es 	 	 per 	 mission 	 	;
 with 	 out 	 	 per 	 mission 	 	,	you	are	a	 trespass 	 er 	 	.
you	're	a	 trespass 	 er 	 	with	about	 a 	 s 	 	much	sense
 a 	 s 	 	these	people	 we 	 re 	 	 trespass 	 ers 	 	.
common	sense	here	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	not	yet	 revolt 	 ed 	 	in	 respons 	 e 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	that	the	law	 ha 	 s 	 	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	to	these	 form 	 s 	 	of	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	what	we	've	 s 	 een 	 
is	 some 	 thing 	 	much	 wo 	 rse 	 	than	a	revolt	.
there	's	a	growing	 extrem 	 ism 	 	that	 come 	 s 	 	from	both	 side 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	debate	,	in	 respons 	 e 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	conflict	between	the	law	and	the	use	of	these	 techno 	 logies 	 	.
one	side	 build 	 s 	 	new	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	one	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 announce 	 d 	 	that	will	 en 	 able 	 	them	to	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	take	down	from	 s 	 ites 	 	like	youtube	any	content	that	 ha 	 s 	 	any	 copy 	 right 	 ed 	 	content	in	it	,	 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	there	's	a	judgment	of	fair	use	that	might	be	 appli 	 ed 	 	to	the	use	of	that	content	.
and	on	the	other	side	,	among	our	 kid 	 s 	 	,	there	's	a	growing	 copy 	 right 	 	 a 	 bol 	 ition 	 ism 	 	,	a	generation	that	 reject 	 s 	 	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	of	what	 copy 	 right 	 	is	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	do	,	 reject 	 s 	 	 copy 	 right 	 	and	 believ 	 es 	 	that	the	law	is	 noth 	 ing 	 	more	than	an	ass	to	be	 ignor 	 ed 	 	and	to	be	 f 	 ought 	 	at	every	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	possible	.
the	 extrem 	 ism 	 	on	one	side	 be 	 get 	 s 	 	 extrem 	 ism 	 	on	the	other	,	a	fact	we	should	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	over	,	and	both	 extrem 	 es 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	debate	are	just	wrong	.
now	,	the	balance	that	i	try	to	fight	for	,
i	,	 a 	 s 	 	any	good	liberal	,	try	to	fight	for	first
by	looking	to	the	government	.	total	 mistak 	 e 	 	,	right	?
 look 	 ed 	 	first	to	the	 court 	 s 	 	and	the	 legisl 	 ature 	 s 	 	to	try	to	get	them
to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	to	make	the	system	make	more	sense	.
it	 fail 	 ed 	 	 part 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 court 	 s 	 	are	too	 pass 	 ive 	 	,
 part 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 legisl 	 ature 	 s 	 	are	 corrupt 	 ed 	 	,
by	which	i	do	n't	mean	that	there	's	 bribe 	 ry 	 	 oper 	 ating 	 	to	stop	real	change	,	but	more	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	of	influence	that	 govern 	 s 	 	how	congress	 function 	 s 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	 policy 	 makers 	 	here	will	not	understand	 th 	 is 	 
 un 	 til 	 	it	's	too	late	to	fix	it	.
so	,	we	need	 some 	 thing 	 	different	,	we	need	a	different	kind	of	solution	.	and	the	solution	here	,	in	my	view	,	is	a	private	solution	,	a	solution	that	 look 	 s 	 	to	 legal 	 ize 	 	what	it	is	to	be	young	 aga 	 in 	 	,	and	to	 real 	 ize 	 	the	economic	potential	of	that	,	and	that	's	where	the	story	of	bmi	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	relevant	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	bmi	 demonst 	 rated 	 	,	 com 	 petition 	 	here	can	 achiev 	 e 	 	some	form	of	balance	.	the	same	thing	can	happen	now	.
we	do	n't	have	a	public	domain	to	draw	 up 	 on 	 	now	,	so	 in 	 stead 	 	what	we	need	is	two	 type 	 s 	 	of	 change 	 s 	 	.
first	,	that	 artist 	 s 	 	and	 creator 	 s 	 	embrace	the	idea	,	 choos 	 e 	 	that	 the 	 ir 	 	work	be	made	 avail 	 able 	 	more	 free 	 ly 	 	.
so	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	they	can	say	 the 	 ir 	 	work	is	 avail 	 able 	 	 free 	 ly 	 	for	non	-	commercial	,	 th 	 is 	 	amateur	-	type	of	use	,
but	not	 free 	 ly 	 	for	any	commercial	use	.
and	second	,	we	need	the	 business 	 es 	 	that	are	building	out	 th 	 is 	 	read	-	write	culture	to	embrace	 th 	 is 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	 express 	 ly 	 	,	to	 en 	 able 	 	it	,	so	that	 th 	 is 	 	 eco 	 logy 	 	of	free	content	,	or	 free 	 r 	 	content	,	can	grow	on	a	neutral	platform	where	they	both	exist	 simultaneous 	 ly 	 	,	so	that	more	-	free	can	compete	with	less	-	free	,	and	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	develop	the	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	in	that	 com 	 petition 	 	can	teach	one	the	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	of	the	other	.
now	,	i	would	talk	about	one	 part 	 icular 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	plan	that	i	know	 some 	 thing 	 	about	,	but	i	do	n't	want	to	 viol 	 ate 	 	ted	's	first	 command 	 ment 	 	of	selling	,
so	i	'm	not	going	to	talk	about	 th 	 is 	 	at	all	.
i	'm	 in 	 stead 	 	just	going	to	 re 	 mind 	 	you	of	the	point	that	bmi	 teach 	 es 	 	us	.
that	artist	choice	is	the	key	for	new	technology	 hav 	 ing 	 	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	be	open	for	business	,	and	we	need	to	build	artist	choice	here	if	these	new	 techno 	 logies 	 	are	to	have	that	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
but	let	me	end	with	 some 	 thing 	 	i	think	much	more	 import 	 ant 	 	--	much	more	 import 	 ant 	 	than	business	.	it	's	the	point	about	how	 th 	 is 	 	 connect 	 s 	 	to	our	 kid 	 s 	 	.
we	have	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	they	're	different	from	us	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	us	,	right	?
we	made	 mix 	 ed 	 	 tape 	 s 	 	;	they	remix	music	.
we	 watch 	 ed 	 	tv	;	they	make	tv	.
it	is	technology	that	 ha 	 s 	 	made	them	different	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	we	see	what	 th 	 is 	 	technology	can	do	,	we	need	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	you	ca	n't	kill	the	instinct	the	technology	 produce 	 s 	 	.	we	can	 on 	 ly 	 	 criminal 	 ize 	 	it	.
we	ca	n't	stop	our	 kid 	 s 	 	from	using	it	.
we	can	 on 	 ly 	 	drive	it	 under 	 ground 	 	.
we	ca	n't	make	our	 kid 	 s 	 	 pass 	 ive 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.	we	can	 on 	 ly 	 	make	them	,	quote	,	``	 pirate 	 s 	 	.	``	and	is	that	good	?
we	live	in	 th 	 is 	 	weird	time	.	it	's	kind	of	age	of	 prohibit 	 ions 	 	,	where	in	 man 	 y 	 	 area 	 s 	 	of	our	life	,	we	live	life	 constant 	 ly 	 	against	the	law	.
 ordin 	 ary 	 	people	live	life	against	the	law	,
and	that	's	what	i	--	we	are	 do 	 ing 	 	to	our	 kid 	 s 	 	.
they	live	life	 know 	 ing 	 	they	live	it	against	the	law	.
that	 real 	 ization 	 	is	 extra 	 ordinari 	 ly 	 	 corros 	 ive 	 	,
 extra 	 ordinari 	 ly 	 	 corrupt 	 ing 	 	.
and	in	a	 demo 	 cracy 	 	,	we	ought	to	be	able	to	do	better	.
do	better	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	for	them	,	if	not	for	 open 	 ing 	 	for	business	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
