i	want	to	start	off	by	 say 	 ing 	 	,	houston	,	we	have	a	problem	.
we	're	 enter 	 ing 	 	a	second	generation	of	no	progress	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	human	flight	in	space	.	in	fact	,	we	've	 regress 	 ed 	 	.
we	stand	a	 ver 	 y 	 	big	chance	of	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	our	ability	to	inspire	our	youth	to	go	out	and	 continu 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	that	we	 a 	 s 	 	a	species	have	 al 	 ways 	 	 d 	 one 	 	.
and	that	is	,	 instinct 	 ively 	 	we	've	gone	out	and	 climb 	 ed 	 	over	difficult	 place 	 s 	 	,	went	to	more	 hostil 	 e 	 	 place 	 s 	 	,
and	found	out	 lat 	 er 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	to	our	surprise	,	that	that	's	the	reason	we	 surviv 	 ed 	 	.
and	i	feel	 ver 	 y 	 	 strong 	 ly 	 	that	it	's	not	good	 en 	 ough 	 	for	us	to	have	 generation 	 s 	 	of	 kid 	 s 	 	that	think	that	it	's	ok	to	look	forward	to	a	better	version	of	a	cell	phone	with	a	video	in	it	.
they	need	to	look	forward	to	exploration	;	they	need	to	look	forward	to	 colon 	 ization 	 	;	they	need	to	look	forward	to	 break 	 through 	 s 	 	.
we	need	to	inspire	them	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	need	to	lead	us	and	help	us	 surviv 	 e 	 	in	the	future	.
i	'm	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 trouble 	 d 	 	that	what	nasa	's	 do 	 ing 	 	right	now	with	 th 	 is 	 	new	bush	 doctri 	 ne 	 	to	--	for	 th 	 is 	 	next	decade	and	a	half	--	oh	shoot	,	i	 screw 	 ed 	 	up	.
we	have	real	specific	 instruct 	 ions 	 	here	not	to	talk	about	 politic 	 s 	 	.
what	we	're	looking	forward	to	is	--	what	we	're	looking	forward	to	is	not	 on 	 ly 	 	the	inspiration	of	our	children	,
but	the	current	plan	right	now	is	not	 re 	 ally 	 	even	 allow 	 ing 	 	the	most	creative	people	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	--	the	boeing	's	and	lockheed	's	space	 engineer 	 s 	 	--	to	go	out	and	take	 risk 	 s 	 	and	try	new	stuff	.
we	're	going	to	go	back	to	the	moon	...	50	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	?	and	we	're	going	to	do	it	 ver 	 y 	 	 specific 	 ally 	 	 plan 	 ned 	 	to	not	learn	 any 	 thing 	 	new	.
i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 trouble 	 d 	 	by	that	.	but	 any 	 way 	 	that	's	--	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	the	thing	that	i	want	to	share	with	you	 to 	 day 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	is	that	right	back	to	where	we	inspire	people	who	will	be	our	great	 lead 	 ers 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
that	's	the	theme	of	my	next	15	 minute 	 s 	 	here	.
and	i	think	that	the	inspiration	 begin 	 s 	 	when	you	're	 ver 	 y 	 	young	:	three	-	year	-	olds	,	up	to	12-	,	14	-	year	-	olds	.
what	they	look	at	is	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	.
let	's	take	a	 snap 	 shot 	 	at	 av 	 iation 	 	.
and	there	was	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	little	short	four	-	year	time	period	when	 marvel 	 ous 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
it	 start 	 ed 	 	in	1908	,	when	the	wright	 brother 	 s 	 	flew	in	paris	,	and	 every 	 body 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	ooh	,	 he 	 y 	 	,	i	can	do	that	.	``	there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	a	few	people	that	have	 flow 	 n 	 	in	early	1908	.	in	four	 year 	 s 	 	,	39	 count 	 ries 	 	had	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	,	thousand	of	 pilot 	 s 	 	.	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 invent 	 ed 	 	by	natural	 s 	 election 	 	.
now	you	can	say	that	intelligent	design	 design 	 s 	 	our	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	of	 to 	 day 	 	,	but	there	was	no	intelligent	design	 re 	 ally 	 	 design 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	early	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	 prob 	 ably 	 	at	 l 	 east 	 	30,000	different	 thing 	 s 	 	 tri 	 ed 	 	,	and	when	they	crash	and	kill	the	pilot	,	do	n't	try	that	 aga 	 in 	 	.
the	 one 	 s 	 	that	flew	and	 land 	 ed 	 	ok	 be 	 cause 	 	there	 we 	 re 	 	no	trained	 pilot 	 s 	 	who	had	good	 fly 	 ing 	 	 qual 	 ities 	 	by	definition	.
so	we	,	by	making	a	whole	bunch	of	 attempt 	 s 	 	,	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 attempt 	 s 	 	,	in	that	four	-	year	time	period	,	we	 invent 	 ed 	 	the	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	of	the	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	that	we	fly	 to 	 day 	 	.	and	that	's	why	they	're	so	safe	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	 g 	 ave 	 	it	a	lot	of	chance	to	find	what	's	good	.
that	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 happen 	 ed 	 	at	all	in	space	 fly 	 ing 	 	.
there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	two	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	 tri 	 ed 	 	--	two	by	the	u.s.	and	one	by	the	russians	.
well	,	who	was	inspired	 dur 	 ing 	 	that	time	period	?
 av 	 iation 	 	week	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	to	make	a	list	of	who	i	thought	 we 	 re 	 	the	 move 	 rs 	 	and	 shake 	 rs 	 	of	the	first	100	 year 	 s 	 	of	 av 	 iation 	 	.
and	i	wrote	them	down	and	i	found	out	 lat 	 er 	 	that	every	one	of	them	was	a	little	kid	in	that	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 ren 	 aiss 	 ance 	 	of	 av 	 iation 	 	.
well	,	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	when	i	was	a	little	kid	was	--	some	 pre 	 tty 	 	heavy	stuff	too	.
the	jet	age	 start 	 ed 	 	:	the	 mis 	 s 	 ile 	 	age	 start 	 ed 	 	.	von	braun	was	on	there	 show 	 ing 	 	how	to	go	to	mars	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	was	before	sputnik	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	at	a	time	when	mars	was	a	hell	of	a	lot	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	than	it	is	now	.	we	thought	there	'd	be	 animal 	 s 	 	there	;	we	 k 	 new 	 	there	 we 	 re 	 	 plant 	 s 	 	there	;	the	 color 	 s 	 	change	,	right	?
but	,	you	know	,	nasa	 screw 	 ed 	 	that	up	 be 	 cause 	 	they	've	 s 	 ent 	 	these	 robot 	 s 	 	and	they	've	 land 	 ed 	 	it	 on 	 ly 	 	in	the	 desert 	 s 	 	.
if	you	look	at	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	little	black	line	is	 a 	 s 	 	fast	 a 	 s 	 	man	ever	flew	,	and	the	red	line	is	top	-	of	-	the	-	line	 militar 	 y 	 	 fight 	 ers 	 	and	the	blue	line	is	commercial	air	transport	.
you	notice	here	's	a	big	jump	when	i	was	a	little	kid	--	and	i	think	that	had	 some 	 thing 	 	to	do	with	giving	me	the	courage	to	go	out	and	try	 some 	 thing 	 	that	other	people	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	courage	to	try	.
well	,	what	did	i	do	when	i	was	a	kid	?
i	did	n't	do	the	 hot 	 rod 	 s 	 	and	the	 girl 	 s 	 	and	the	 danc 	 ing 	 
and	,	well	,	we	did	n't	have	 drug 	 s 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 day 	 s 	 	.	but	i	did	 com 	 petition 	 	model	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	.
i	 s 	 pent 	 	about	seven	 year 	 s 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	vietnam	war	flight	-	 test 	 ing 	 	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	for	the	air	force	.	and	then	i	went	in	and	i	had	a	lot	of	 f 	 un 	 	building	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	that	people	could	build	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 gar 	 age 	 s 	 	.
and	some	3,000	of	 t 	 hose 	 	are	 fly 	 ing 	 	.	of	course	,	one	of	them	is	around	the	world	voyager	.	i	 found 	 ed 	 	 an 	 other 	 	company	in	'82	,	which	is	my	company	now	.
and	we	have	 develop 	 ed 	 	more	than	one	new	type	of	 air 	 plane 	 	every	year	since	1982	.
and	there	's	a	lot	of	them	that	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	ca	n't	show	you	on	 th 	 is 	 	chart	.
the	most	 impress 	 ive 	 	 air 	 plane 	 	ever	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	was	designed	 on 	 ly 	 	a	dozen	 year 	 s 	 	after	the	first	 operation 	 al 	 	jet	.
 stay 	 ed 	 	in	service	till	it	was	too	 rust 	 y 	 	to	fly	,	taken	out	of	service	.
we	 re 	 treat 	 ed 	 	in	'98	back	to	 some 	 thing 	 	that	was	 develop 	 ed 	 	in	'56	.	what	?
the	most	 impress 	 ive 	 	 space 	 ship 	 	ever	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	was	a	grumman	 lun 	 ar 	 	 land 	 er 	 	.	it	was	a	--	you	know	,	it	 land 	 ed 	 	on	the	moon	,	take	off	of	the	moon	,	did	n't	need	any	maintenance	 guy 	 s 	 	--	that	's	kind	of	cool	.
we	've	lost	that	 cap 	 ability 	 	.	we	 abandon 	 ed 	 	it	in	'72	.
 th 	 is 	 	thing	was	designed	three	 year 	 s 	 	after	gagarin	first	flew	in	space	in	1961	.
three	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	we	ca	n't	do	that	now	.	crazy	.
talk	 ver 	 y 	 	 brief 	 ly 	 	about	 innov 	 ation 	 	 cycle 	 s 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	that	grow	,	have	a	lot	of	activity	;	they	die	out	when	they	're	 replace 	 d 	 	by	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
these	 thing 	 s 	 	tend	to	happen	every	25	 year 	 s 	 	.	40	 year 	 s 	 	long	,	with	an	 over 	 lap 	 	.	you	can	put	that	 state 	 ment 	 	on	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	different	 techno 	 logies 	 	.	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	--
by	the	way	,	the	speed	here	,	excuse	me	,	 high 	 er 	 	-	speed	travel	is	the	title	of	these	 innov 	 ation 	 	 cycle 	 s 	 	.	there	is	 non 	 e 	 	here	.
these	two	new	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	are	the	same	speed	 a 	 s 	 	the	dc	8	that	was	 d 	 one 	 	in	1958	.
here	's	the	 big 	 gie 	 	,	and	that	is	,	you	do	n't	have	 innov 	 ation 	 	 cycle 	 s 	 	if	the	government	 develop 	 s 	 	and	the	government	uses	it	.
you	know	,	a	good	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	of	course	,	is	the	darpa	net	.
 computer 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	used	for	 art 	 ille 	 ry 	 	first	,	then	irs	.
but	when	we	got	it	,	now	you	have	all	the	level	of	activity	,	all	the	benefit	from	it	.	private	sector	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	it	.
keep	that	in	mind	.	i	put	down	 innov 	 ation 	 	--
i	've	 look 	 ed 	 	for	 innov 	 ation 	 	 cycle 	 s 	 	in	space	;	i	found	 non 	 e 	 	.
the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	year	,	 start 	 ing 	 	when	gagarin	went	in	space	,	and	a	few	 week 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	alan	shepherd	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	five	 mann 	 ed 	 	space	 flight 	 s 	 	in	the	world	--	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	year	.
in	2003	,	 every 	 one 	 	that	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 s 	 ent 	 	to	space	was	 kill 	 ed 	 	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	three	or	four	 flight 	 s 	 	in	2003	.
in	2004	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	two	 flight 	 s 	 	:	two	russian	soyuz	 flight 	 s 	 	to	the	 inter 	 national 	 	 mann 	 ed 	 	station	.	and	i	had	to	fly	three	in	mojave	with	my	little	group	of	a	couple	dozen	people	in	order	to	get	to	a	total	of	five	,	which	was	the	number	the	same	year	back	in	1961	.
there	is	no	growth	.	there	's	no	activity	.	there	's	no	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	here	taken	from	spaceshipone	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	here	taken	from	orbit	.
our	goal	is	to	make	it	so	that	you	can	see	 th 	 is 	 	picture	and	 re 	 ally 	 	enjoy	that	.
we	know	how	to	do	it	for	sub	-	orbital	 fly 	 ing 	 	now	,	do	it	safe	 en 	 ough 	 	--	at	 l 	 east 	 	 a 	 s 	 	safe	 a 	 s 	 	the	early	 air 	 lines 	 	--	so	that	can	be	 d 	 one 	 	.
and	i	think	i	want	to	talk	a	little	bit	about	why	we	had	the	courage	to	go	out	and	try	that	 a 	 s 	 	a	small	company	.
well	,	first	of	all	,	what	's	going	to	happen	next	?
the	first	industry	will	be	a	high	volume	,	a	lot	of	 player 	 s 	 	.
there	's	 an 	 other 	 	one	 announce 	 d 	 	just	last	week	.
and	it	will	be	sub	-	orbital	.	and	the	reason	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	sub	-	orbital	is	,	there	is	not	 solution 	 s 	 	for	 ad 	 equate 	 	 safe 	 ty 	 	to	fly	the	public	to	orbit	.	the	 government 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	--	three	 government 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	for	45	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	still	four	percent	of	the	people	that	have	left	the	atmosphere	have	 di 	 ed 	 	.
that	's	--	you	do	n't	want	to	run	a	business	with	that	kind	of	a	 safe 	 ty 	 	record	.
it	'll	be	 ver 	 y 	 	high	volume	;	we	think	100,000	people	will	fly	by	2020	.
i	ca	n't	tell	you	when	 th 	 is 	 	will	start	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	do	n't	want	my	 com 	 petition 	 	to	know	my	schedule	.
but	i	think	once	it	 do 	 es 	 	,	we	will	find	 solution 	 s 	 	,
and	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	you	'll	see	 t 	 hose 	 	resort	 hotel 	 s 	 	in	orbit	.
and	that	real	easy	thing	to	do	,	which	is	a	 s 	 wing 	 	around	the	moon	so	you	have	 th 	 is 	 	cool	view	.	and	that	will	be	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	moon	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	an	atmosphere	--	you	can	do	an	 elli 	 pt 	 ical 	 	orbit	and	 mis 	 s 	 	it	by	10	feet	if	you	want	.
oh	,	it	's	going	to	be	so	much	 f 	 un 	 	.
ok	.	my	 critic 	 s 	 	say	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	rutan	's	just	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	these	 billion 	 aire 	 s 	 	'	money	for	 joy 	 ride 	 s 	 	for	 billion 	 aire 	 s 	 	.
what	's	 th 	 is 	 	?	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	 transport 	 ation 	 	system	;	it	's	just	for	 f 	 un 	 	.	``
and	i	used	to	be	 both 	 er 	 ed 	 	by	that	,	and	then	i	got	to	 think 	 ing 	 	,
well	,	wait	a	minute	.	i	 b 	 ought 	 	my	first	apple	computer	in	1978
and	i	 b 	 ought 	 	it	 be 	 cause 	 	i	could	say	,	``	i	got	a	computer	at	my	house	and	you	do	n't	.
'	what	do	you	use	it	for	?	'	come	over	.	it	 do 	 es 	 	frogger	.	``	ok	.
not	the	bank	's	computer	or	lockheed	's	computer	,	but	the	home	computer	was	for	 game 	 s 	 	.
for	a	whole	decade	it	was	for	 f 	 un 	 	--	we	did	n't	even	know	what	it	was	for	.
but	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	the	fact	that	we	had	 th 	 is 	 	big	industry	,	big	 develop 	 ment 	 	,	big	 improve 	 ment 	 	and	 cap 	 ability 	 	and	so	on	,	and	they	get	out	there	in	 en 	 ough 	 	 home 	 s 	 	--	we	 we 	 re 	 	 rip 	 e 	 	for	a	new	 invent 	 ion 	 	.
and	the	inventor	is	in	 th 	 is 	 	audience	.
al	gore	 invent 	 ed 	 	the	 inter 	 net 	 	and	 be 	 cause 	 	of	that	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	used	for	a	whole	year	--	excuse	me	--	a	whole	decade	for	 f 	 un 	 	,	 be 	 came 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	--	our	commerce	,	our	research	,	our	communication	and	,	if	we	let	the	google	 guy 	 s 	 	think	for	 an 	 other 	 	couple	 week 	 end 	 s 	 	,	we	can	add	a	dozen	more	 thing 	 s 	 	to	the	list	.
and	it	wo	n't	be	 ver 	 y 	 	long	before	you	wo	n't	be	able	to	 con 	 vince 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	that	we	did	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	have	 computer 	 s 	 	in	our	 home 	 s 	 	.
so	 f 	 un 	 	is	 defend 	 able 	 	.
ok	,	i	want	to	show	you	kind	of	a	 bus 	 y 	 	chart	,	but	in	it	is	my	 predict 	 ion 	 	with	what	's	going	to	happen	.
and	in	it	 al 	 so 	 	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	up	 an 	 other 	 	point	,	right	here	.
there	's	a	group	of	people	that	have	come	forward	--	and	you	do	n't	know	all	of	them	--	but	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	have	come	forward	 we 	 re 	 	inspired	 a 	 s 	 	young	children	,	 th 	 is 	 	little	three	-	to	15	-	year	-	old	age	,	by	us	going	to	orbit	and	going	to	the	moon	here	,	right	in	 th 	 is 	 	time	period	.
paul	allen	,	elan	musk	,	richard	branson	,	jeff	bezos	,	the	ansari	family	,	which	is	now	 fund 	 ing 	 	the	russians	'	sub	-	orbital	thing	,	bob	bigelow	,	a	private	space	station	,	and	carmack	.
these	people	are	taking	money	and	 put 	 ting 	 	it	in	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	area	,	and	i	think	it	's	a	lot	better	than	they	put	it	in	an	area	of	a	better	cell	phone	or	 some 	 thing 	 	--	but	they	're	 put 	 ting 	 	it	in	 ver 	 y 	 	--	 area 	 s 	 	and	 th 	 is 	 	will	lead	us	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 cap 	 ability 	 	,	and	it	will	lead	us	 in 	 to 	 	the	next	 re 	 ally 	 	big	thing	and	it	will	allow	us	to	explore	.	and	i	think	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	it	will	allow	us	to	 colon 	 ize 	 	and	to	keep	us	from	going	extinct	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	inspired	by	big	progress	.	but	look	at	the	progress	that	's	going	on	after	that	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	a	couple	of	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	here	.
the	 militar 	 y 	 	 fight 	 ers 	 	had	a	--	highest	-	performance	 militar 	 y 	 	 air 	 plane 	 	was	the	sr	71.	it	went	a	whole	life	cycle	,	got	too	 rust 	 y 	 	to	fly	,
and	was	taken	out	of	service	.	the	concorde	 double 	 d 	 	the	speed	for	 air 	 line 	 	travel	.
it	went	a	whole	life	cycle	 with 	 out 	 	 com 	 petition 	 	,	took	out	of	service	.	and	we	're	 s 	 tuck 	 	back	here	with	the	same	kind	of	 cap 	 ability 	 	for	 militar 	 y 	 	 fight 	 ers 	 	and	commercial	 air 	 line 	 	travel	that	we	had	back	in	the	late	'50s	.
but	 some 	 thing 	 	is	out	there	to	inspire	our	 kid 	 s 	 	now	.
and	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	if	you	've	got	a	baby	now	,	or	if	you	've	got	a	10	-	year	-	old	now	.
what	's	out	there	is	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	going	to	happen	here	.
 relat 	 ively 	 	soon	,	you	'll	be	able	to	buy	a	ticket	and	fly	 high 	 er 	 	and	 fast 	 er 	 	than	the	highest	-	performance	 militar 	 y 	 	 operation 	 al 	 	 air 	 plane 	 	.	it	's	never	 happen 	 ed 	 	before	.
the	fact	that	they	have	 s 	 tuck 	 	here	with	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	performance	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	,	well	,	you	know	,	you	win	the	war	in	12	 minute 	 s 	 	;	why	do	you	need	 some 	 thing 	 	better	?
but	i	think	when	you	 guy 	 s 	 	start	 buy 	 ing 	 	 ticket 	 s 	 	and	 fly 	 ing 	 	sub	-	orbital	 flight 	 s 	 	to	space	,	 ver 	 y 	 	soon	--	wait	a	minute	,	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	here	,	we	'll	have	 militar 	 y 	 	 fight 	 ers 	 	with	sub	-	orbital	 cap 	 ability 	 	,	and	i	think	 ver 	 y 	 	soon	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	about	it	is	the	commercial	 guy 	 s 	 	are	going	to	go	first	.
ok	,	i	look	forward	to	a	new	``	 capital 	 ist 	 	's	space	race	,	``	let	's	call	it	.
you	remember	the	space	race	in	the	'60s	was	for	national	 pre 	 stig 	 e 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	lost	the	first	two	 mile 	 stone 	 s 	 	.
we	did	n't	lose	them	 technical 	 ly 	 	.	the	fact	that	we	had	the	 hard 	 ware 	 	to	put	 some 	 thing 	 	in	orbit	when	we	let	von	braun	fly	it	--
you	can	 argu 	 e 	 	that	's	not	a	technical	loss	.
sputnik	was	n't	a	technical	loss	,	but	it	was	a	 pre 	 stig 	 e 	 	loss	.
america	--	the	world	saw	america	 a 	 s 	 	not	 be 	 ing 	 	the	 lead 	 er 	 	in	technology	,	and	that	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	thing	.
and	then	we	flew	alan	shepherd	 week 	 s 	 	after	gagarin	,	not	 month 	 s 	 	or	 decade 	 s 	 	,	or	 what 	 ever 	 	.	so	we	had	the	 cap 	 ability 	 	.
but	america	lost	.	we	lost	.	and	 be 	 cause 	 	of	that	,	we	made	a	big	jump	to	 re 	 cover 	 	it	.
well	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	here	is	we	've	lost	to	the	russians	on	the	first	couple	of	 mile 	 stone 	 s 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	.
you	can	not	buy	a	ticket	 commercial 	 ly 	 	to	fly	 in 	 to 	 	space	in	america	--
ca	n't	do	it	.	you	can	buy	it	in	russia	.
you	can	fly	with	russian	 hard 	 ware 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 avail 	 able 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	a	russian	space	program	is	 starv 	 ing 	 	,
and	it	's	nice	for	them	to	get	20	million	here	and	there	to	take	one	of	the	 seat 	 s 	 	.
it	's	commercial	.	it	can	be	defined	 a 	 s 	 	space	 tour 	 ism 	 	.	they	are	 al 	 so 	 	 off 	 er 	 ing 	 	a	trip	to	go	on	 th 	 is 	 	whip	around	the	moon	,	like	apollo	8	was	 d 	 one 	 	.
100	million	 buck 	 s 	 	--	 he 	 y 	 	,	i	can	go	to	the	moon	.
but	,	you	know	,	would	you	have	thought	back	in	the	'60s	,	when	the	space	race	was	going	on	,	that	the	first	commercial	 capital 	 ist 	 	-	like	thing	to	do	to	buy	a	ticket	to	go	to	the	moon	would	be	in	russian	 hard 	 ware 	 	?
and	would	you	have	thought	,	would	the	russians	have	thought	,	that	when	they	first	go	to	the	moon	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	 hard 	 ware 	 	,	the	 guy 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	wo	n't	be	russians	?	 may 	 be 	 	it	'll	 prob 	 ably 	 	be	a	japanese	or	an	american	 billion 	 aire 	 	?	well	,	that	's	weird	:	you	know	,	it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	.
but	 any 	 way 	 	,	i	think	we	need	to	beat	them	 aga 	 in 	 	.
i	think	what	we	'll	do	is	we	'll	see	a	 success 	 ful 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	,	private	space	flight	industry	.	 whet 	 her 	 	we	're	first	or	not	 re 	 ally 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	.
the	russians	 actual 	 ly 	 	flew	a	 super 	 sonic 	 	transport	before	the	concorde	.
and	then	they	flew	a	few	 car 	 go 	 	 flight 	 s 	 	,	and	took	it	out	of	service	.
i	think	you	kind	of	see	the	same	kind	of	parallel	when	the	commercial	stuff	is	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	.
ok	,	we	'll	talk	just	a	little	bit	about	commercial	 develop 	 ment 	 	for	human	space	flight	.
 th 	 is 	 	little	thing	 say 	 s 	 	here	:	five	 time 	 s 	 	what	nasa	's	 do 	 ing 	 	by	2020	.	i	want	to	tell	you	,	 al 	 ready 	 	there	's	about	1.5	billion	to	1.7	billion	 invest 	 ment 	 	in	private	space	flight	that	is	not	government	at	all	--	 al 	 ready 	 	,	 world 	 wide 	 	.	if	you	read	--	if	you	google	it	,	you	'll	find	about	half	of	that	money	,	but	there	's	twice	of	that	 be 	 ing 	 	 commit 	 ted 	 	out	there	--	not	 s 	 pent 	 	yet	,	but	 be 	 ing 	 	 commit 	 ted 	 	and	 plan 	 ned 	 	for	the	next	few	 year 	 s 	 	.	 he 	 y 	 	,	that	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	big	.
i	'm	 predict 	 ing 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 profit 	 able 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	industry	is	going	to	be	--	and	it	 certain 	 ly 	 	is	 profit 	 able 	 	when	you	fly	people	at	200,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	on	 some 	 thing 	 	that	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	 oper 	 ate 	 	at	a	tenth	of	that	cost	,	or	less	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 profit 	 able 	 	.
i	predict	,	 al 	 so 	 	,	that	the	 invest 	 ment 	 	that	will	flow	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	will	be	 some 	 where 	 	around	half	of	what	the	u.s.	taxpayer	 s 	 pend 	 s 	 	for	nasa	's	 mann 	 ed 	 	 space 	 craft 	 	work	.
and	every	dollar	that	 flow 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	that	will	be	 s 	 pent 	 	more	 efficient 	 ly 	 	by	a	factor	of	10	to	15.	and	what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	is	before	we	know	it	,	the	progress	in	human	space	flight	,	with	no	taxpayer	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	will	be	at	a	level	of	about	five	 time 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	the	current	nasa	 budget 	 s 	 	for	human	space	flight	.
and	that	is	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	us	.	it	's	private	industry	.
you	should	never	depend	on	the	government	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	stuff	--
and	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	it	for	a	long	time	.	the	naca	,	before	nasa	,	never	 develop 	 ed 	 	an	 air 	 liner 	 	and	never	ran	an	 air 	 line 	 	.
but	nasa	is	 develop 	 ing 	 	the	space	liner	,	 al 	 ways 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	,	and	 run 	 s 	 	the	 on 	 ly 	 	space	line	,	ok	.	and	we	've	 s 	 hi 	 ed 	 	away	from	it	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	 af 	 raid 	 	of	it	.	but	 start 	 ing 	 	back	in	june	of	2004	,	when	i	 show 	 ed 	 	that	a	little	group	out	there	 actual 	 ly 	 	can	do	it	,	can	get	a	start	with	it	,	 every 	 thing 	 	 change 	 d 	 	after	that	time	.
ok	,	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
