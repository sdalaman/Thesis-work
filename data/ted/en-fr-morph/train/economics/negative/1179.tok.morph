my	name	is	emiliano	salinas	and	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	the	role	we	 member 	 s 	 	of	 socie 	 ty 	 	play	in	the	violent	atmosphere	 th 	 is 	 	country	is	living	in	right	now	.
i	was	born	in	1976	.
i	grew	up	in	a	 tradition 	 al 	 	mexican	family	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	child	,	i	had	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	normal	life	:	i	would	go	to	school	,	play	with	my	 friend 	 s 	 	and	 cousin 	 s 	 	.
but	then	my	father	 be 	 came 	 	 p 	 resident 	 	of	mexico	and	my	life	 change 	 d 	 	.
what	i	'm	about	to	say	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	some	of	what	i	'm	about	to	say	,	will	cause	 contr 	 over 	 s 	 y 	 	.
 first 	 ly 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	the	one	who	's	going	to	say	it	.
and	 second 	 ly 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	what	i	'm	going	to	say	is	true	,	and	it	will	make	a	lot	of	people	nervous	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	we	do	n't	want	to	hear	.
but	it	's	 imper 	 ative 	 	that	we	listen	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 un 	 deni 	 able 	 	and	definitive	.
it	will	 al 	 so 	 	make	 member 	 s 	 	of	criminal	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	nervous	for	the	same	 reason 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	talk	about	the	role	we	 member 	 s 	 	of	 socie 	 ty 	 	play	in	 th 	 is 	 	 phenomen 	 on 	 	,	and	about	four	different	 respons 	 e 	 	 level 	 s 	 	we	 citizen 	 s 	 	have	against	violence	.
i	know	 man 	 y 	 	will	find	it	difficult	to	 separat 	 e 	 	the	fact	that	i	'm	carlos	salinas	de	gortari	's	son	from	the	fact	that	i	'm	a	citizen	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	the	country	's	current	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
do	n't	worry	.
it	's	not	 necess 	 ary 	 	for	 understand 	 ing 	 	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	what	i	'm	going	to	say	.
i	think	we	have	a	problem	in	mexico	.
we	have	a	big	problem	.
i	think	there	's	 con 	 sens 	 us 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
no	one	 argu 	 es 	 	--
we	all	agree	there	's	a	problem	.
what	we	do	n't	agree	on	is	what	the	problem	 actual 	 ly 	 	is	.
is	it	the	zetas	?	the	drug	 traffic 	 ker 	 s 	 	?	the	government	?
 corrupt 	 ion 	 	?	poverty	?	or	is	it	 some 	 thing 	 	else	?
i	think	 non 	 e 	 	of	these	is	the	problem	.
i	do	n't	mean	they	do	n't	deserve	attention	.
but	we	wo	n't	be	able	to	take	care	of	any	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	if	we	do	n't	solve	the	real	problem	we	have	in	mexico	first	.
the	real	problem	we	have	is	most	of	us	mexicans	,	we	 believ 	 e 	 	we	are	 victim 	 s 	 	of	our	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	.
we	are	a	country	of	 victim 	 s 	 	.
 historic 	 ally 	 	,	we	've	 al 	 ways 	 	 act 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 victim 	 s 	 	of	 some 	 thing 	 	or	 some 	 body 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 victim 	 s 	 	of	the	spaniards	.
then	we	 we 	 re 	 	 victim 	 s 	 	of	the	french	.
then	we	 we 	 re 	 	 victim 	 s 	 	of	don	porfirio	.
then	we	 we 	 re 	 	 victim 	 s 	 	of	the	pri	.
even	of	salinas	.
and	of	el	peje	.
and	now	of	the	zetas	and	the	 traffic 	 ker 	 s 	 	and	the	 criminal 	 s 	 	and	the	 kidnap 	 per 	 s 	 	...
hold	on	!	wait	a	minute	!
what	if	 non 	 e 	 	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	is	the	problem	?
the	problem	is	not	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	feel	 victim 	 s 	 	of	.
the	problem	is	that	we	play	the	role	of	 victim 	 s 	 	.
we	need	to	open	our	 eye 	 s 	 	and	see	that	we	are	not	 victim 	 s 	 	.
if	 on 	 ly 	 	we	 stop 	 ped 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	like	 victim 	 s 	 	,	if	we	 stop 	 ped 	 	 act 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 victim 	 s 	 	,	our	country	would	change	so	much	!
i	'm	going	to	talk	about	how	to	go	from	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	that	 act 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	victim	of	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	to	a	 respons 	 ible 	 	,	 involve 	 d 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	that	 take 	 s 	 	the	future	of	 it 	 s 	 	country	in	 it 	 s 	 	own	 hand 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	talk	about	four	different	 level 	 s 	 	of	civil	 respons 	 e 	 	against	violence	,	from	 weak 	 est 	 	to	 strong 	 est 	 	.
the	first	level	,	the	 weak 	 est 	 	level	of	civil	 respons 	 e 	 	against	violence	,	is	 deni 	 al 	 	and	 a 	 pathy 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	much	of	mexican	 socie 	 ty 	 	is	in	 deni 	 al 	 	of	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	we	're	going	through	.
we	want	to	go	on	with	our	 dai 	 ly 	 	life	even	 th 	 ough 	 	we	are	not	living	under	normal	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	.
 dai 	 ly 	 	life	in	our	country	is	,	to	say	the	 l 	 east 	 	,	under	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	,	 exception 	 al 	 	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	.
it	's	like	 some 	 one 	 	who	 ha 	 s 	 	a	serious	 ill 	 ness 	 	and	 pretend 	 s 	 	it	's	the	flu	and	it	will	just	go	away	.
we	want	to	pretend	that	mexico	 ha 	 s 	 	the	flu	.
but	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	.
mexico	 ha 	 s 	 	cancer	.
and	if	we	do	n't	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	it	,	the	cancer	will	end	up	 kill 	 ing 	 	it	.
we	need	to	move	mexican	 socie 	 ty 	 	from	 deni 	 al 	 	and	 a 	 pathy 	 	to	the	next	level	of	citizen	 respons 	 e 	 	,	which	is	,	 effective 	 ly 	 	,	 re 	 cognition 	 	.
and	that	 re 	 cognition 	 	will	 s 	 ow 	 	fear	--	 recogn 	 izing 	 	the	 serious 	 ness 	 	of	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
but	,	fear	is	better	than	 a 	 pathy 	 
 be 	 cause 	 	fear	 make 	 s 	 	us	do	 some 	 thing 	 	.
 man 	 y 	 	people	in	mexico	are	 af 	 raid 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 af 	 raid 	 	.
and	we	're	 act 	 ing 	 	out	of	that	fear	.
and	let	me	tell	you	what	the	problem	is	with	 act 	 ing 	 	out	of	fear	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	second	level	of	civil	 respons 	 e 	 	:	fear	.
let	's	think	about	mexican	 street 	 s 	 	:	they	're	 un 	 safe 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	violence	,	so	people	stay	at	home	.
 do 	 es 	 	that	make	 street 	 s 	 	more	or	less	safe	?
less	safe	!
so	 street 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	more	desolate	and	 un 	 safe 	 	,	so	we	stay	home	more	--
which	 make 	 s 	 	 street 	 s 	 	even	more	desolate	and	 un 	 safe 	 	,	and	we	stay	home	even	more	.
 th 	 is 	 	 vic 	 ious 	 	circle	 end 	 s 	 	up	with	the	whole	population	 s 	 tuck 	 	 in 	 side 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 house 	 s 	 	,	 scar 	 ed 	 	to	death	--
even	more	 af 	 raid 	 	than	when	we	 we 	 re 	 	out	on	the	 street 	 s 	 	.
we	need	to	confront	 th 	 is 	 	fear	.
we	need	to	move	mexican	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	the	 member 	 s 	 	of	 socie 	 ty 	 	who	are	at	 th 	 is 	 	level	,	to	the	next	level	,	which	is	action	.
we	need	to	face	our	 fear 	 s 	 	and	take	back	our	 street 	 s 	 	,	our	cities	,	our	 neighbor 	 hood 	 s 	 	.
for	 man 	 y 	 	people	,	 act 	 ing 	 	 involve 	 s 	 	rage	.
we	go	from	fear	to	rage	.
they	say	,	``	i	ca	n't	take	it	 any 	 more 	 	.
let	's	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	it	.	``	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	sensitive	figure	--	35	public	 ly 	 nch 	 ing 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 record 	 ed 	 	so	far	in	2010	in	mexico	.
 usual 	 ly 	 	it	's	one	or	two	a	year	.
now	we	're	 ex 	 peri 	 encing 	 	one	every	week	.
 th 	 is 	 	 show 	 s 	 	that	 socie 	 ty 	 	is	desperate	and	it	's	taking	the	law	 in 	 to 	 	 it 	 s 	 	own	 hand 	 s 	 	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	violent	action	--	 th 	 ough 	 	action	is	better	than	no	action	--	but	taking	part	in	it	 on 	 ly 	 	 dis 	 guise 	 s 	 	violence	.
if	i	'm	violent	with	you	and	you	respond	with	violence	,	you	 be 	 come 	 	part	of	the	violence	and	you	just	 dis 	 guise 	 	my	violence	.
so	civil	action	is	vital	,	but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	vital	to	take	people	who	are	at	the	level	of	rage	and	violent	action	to	the	next	level	,	which	is	non	-	violent	action	.
it	's	 pac 	 ific 	 	,	 coordinate 	 d 	 	civil	action	,	which	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	 pass 	 ive 	 	action	.
it	 mean 	 s 	 	it	's	 determine 	 d 	 	and	effective	,	but	not	violent	.
there	are	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	action	in	mexico	.
two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	in	galena	city	,	chihuahua	,	a	member	of	the	community	was	 kidnap 	 ped 	 	,	eric	le	barón	.
his	 brother 	 s 	 	,	benjamín	and	julián	,	got	together	with	the	rest	of	the	community	to	think	of	the	best	course	of	action	:	to	pay	the	 ran 	 som 	 	,	to	take	up	 arm 	 s 	 	and	go	after	the	 kidnap 	 per 	 s 	 	or	to	ask	the	government	for	help	.
in	the	end	,	benjamín	and	julián	 decide 	 d 	 	the	best	thing	they	could	do	was	to	organize	the	community	and	act	together	.
so	what	did	they	do	?
they	 mobilize 	 d 	 	the	whole	community	of	le	barón	to	go	to	chihuahua	,	where	they	 organize 	 d 	 	a	 s 	 it 	 	-	in	in	the	central	park	of	the	city	.
they	 s 	 ent 	 	a	 mess 	 age 	 	to	the	 kidnap 	 per 	 s 	 	:	``	if	you	want	your	 ran 	 som 	 	come	and	get	it	.
we	'll	be	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	you	right	here	.	``
they	 stay 	 ed 	 	there	.
seven	 day 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	eric	was	set	free	and	was	able	to	return	home	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	what	an	 organize 	 d 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	can	do	,	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	that	 act 	 s 	 	.
of	course	,	 criminal 	 s 	 	can	respond	.
and	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	they	did	.
on	july	7th	,	2009	,	benjamín	le	barón	was	 murder 	 ed 	 	.
but	julián	le	barón	 keep 	 s 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	and	he	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 mobil 	 izing 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	in	chihuahua	for	over	a	year	.
and	for	over	a	year	he	 ha 	 s 	 	known	that	a	price	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	put	on	his	head	.
but	he	 keep 	 s 	 	 fight 	 ing 	 	.
he	 keep 	 s 	 	 organ 	 izing 	 	.
he	 keep 	 s 	 	 mobil 	 izing 	 	.
these	 hero 	 ic 	 	 act 	 s 	 	are	present	all	over	the	country	.
with	a	thousand	juliáns	 work 	 ing 	 	together	,	mexico	would	be	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	country	.
and	they	're	out	there	!
they	just	have	to	raise	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	.
i	was	born	in	mexico	,	i	grew	up	in	mexico	and	 a 	 long 	 	the	way	,	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	to	love	mexico	.
i	think	 any 	 one 	 	who	 ha 	 s 	 	 steppe 	 d 	 	foot	on	 th 	 is 	 	land	--	not	to	 ment 	 ion 	 	all	mexican	people	--	will	agree	that	it	's	not	difficult	to	love	mexico	.
i	've	 travel 	 ed 	 	a	lot	and	 no 	 where 	 	else	have	i	found	the	 pass 	 ion 	 	mexicans	have	.
that	devotion	we	feel	for	the	national	 foot 	 ball 	 	team	.
that	devotion	we	show	in	 help 	 ing 	 	 victim 	 s 	 	of	 disaster 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 earth 	 quake 	 	in	1985	or	 th 	 is 	 	year	's	 flood 	 s 	 	.
the	 pass 	 ion 	 	with	which	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	the	national	 ant 	 hem 	 	since	we	 we 	 re 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	.
when	we	thought	masiosare	was	the	strange	 ene 	 my 	 	,	and	we	 s 	 ang 	 	,	with	a	 child 	 like 	 	heart	,	``	a	soldier	in	each	son	.	``
i	think	the	 big 	 gest 	 	insult	,	the	worst	way	you	can	offend	a	mexican	is	to	insult	 the 	 ir 	 	mother	.
a	mother	is	the	most	sacred	thing	in	life	.
mexico	is	our	mother	and	 to 	 day 	 	she	 cri 	 es 	 	out	for	her	children	.
we	are	going	through	the	 dark 	 est 	 	moment	in	our	 re 	 cent 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
our	mother	,	mexico	,	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 viol 	 ated 	 	before	our	 ver 	 y 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	.
what	are	we	going	to	do	?
masiosare	,	the	strange	 ene 	 my 	 	,	is	here	.
where	is	the	soldier	in	each	son	?
mahatma	gandhi	,	one	of	the	 great 	 est 	 	civil	 fight 	 ers 	 	of	all	time	,	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	be	the	change	you	wish	to	see	in	the	world	.	``
 to 	 day 	 	in	mexico	we	're	 ask 	 ing 	 	for	gandhis	.
we	need	ghandis	.
we	need	men	and	women	who	love	mexico	and	who	are	 will 	 ing 	 	to	take	action	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	call	for	every	true	mexican	to	join	 th 	 is 	 	 initi 	 ative 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	call	so	that	every	single	thing	we	love	about	mexico	--	the	 fest 	 ival 	 s 	 	,	the	 market 	 s 	 	,	the	 restaurant 	 s 	 	,	the	 cant 	 ina 	 s 	 	,	the	tequila	,	the	 mar 	 iachis 	 	,	the	serenades	,	the	posadas	,	el	grito	,	the	day	of	the	dead	,	san	miguel	,	the	joy	,	the	 pass 	 ion 	 	for	life	,	the	fight	and	 every 	 thing 	 	it	 mean 	 s 	 	to	be	mexican	--	 do 	 es 	 	n't	disappear	from	 th 	 is 	 	world	.
we	're	facing	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	opponent	.
but	we	are	 man 	 y 	 	more	.
they	can	take	a	man	's	life	.
 any 	 one 	 	can	kill	me	,	or	you	,	or	you	.
but	no	one	can	kill	the	spirit	of	true	mexicans	.
the	battle	is	won	,	but	we	still	have	to	fight	it	.
2000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	the	roman	poet	juvenal	 s 	 aid 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 to 	 day 	 	 echo 	 es 	 	in	the	heart	of	every	true	mexican	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	count	it	the	 great 	 est 	 	 s 	 in 	 	to	prefer	life	to	honor	,	and	for	the	sake	of	living	to	lose	what	 make 	 s 	 	life	worth	living	.	``	thank	you	.
