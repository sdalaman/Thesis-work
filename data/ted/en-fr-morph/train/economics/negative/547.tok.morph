that	culprit	is	business	and	industry	,

i	once	told	a	fortune	magazine	writer	that	 some 	 day 	 	people	like	me	would	go	to	jail	.
and	that	 be 	 came 	 	the	 head 	 line 	 	of	a	fortune	article	.
they	went	on	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	me	 a 	 s 	 	america	's	 green 	 est 	 	ceo	.
from	 plunder 	 er 	 	to	 re 	 cover 	 ing 	 	 plunder 	 er 	 	,	to	america	's	 green 	 est 	 	ceo	in	five	 year 	 s 	 	--
that	,	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	was	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	 s 	 ad 	 	 comment 	 ary 	 	on	american	ceos	in	1999	.
 ask 	 ed 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	in	the	canadian	 document 	 ary 	 	,	``	the	corporation	,	``	what	i	 me 	 ant 	 	by	the	``	go	to	jail	``	remark	,	i	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	that	 t 	 heft 	 	is	a	crime	.
and	 t 	 heft 	 	of	our	children	's	future	would	 some 	 day 	 	be	a	crime	.
but	i	 real 	 ized 	 	,	for	that	to	be	true	--	for	 t 	 heft 	 	of	our	children	's	future	to	be	a	crime	--	there	must	be	a	clear	,	 demonst 	 r 	 able 	 	 alter 	 native 	 	to	the	take	-	make	-	waste	industrial	system	that	so	 dominate 	 s 	 	our	 civil 	 ization 	 	,	and	is	the	major	culprit	,	 steal 	 ing 	 	our	children	's	future	,	by	 dig 	 ging 	 	up	the	earth	and	 convert 	 ing 	 	it	to	 product 	 s 	 	that	 quick 	 ly 	 	 be 	 come 	 	waste	in	a	 land 	 fill 	 	or	an	 inciner 	 ator 	 	--
in	short	,	 dig 	 ging 	 	up	the	earth	and	 convert 	 ing 	 	it	to	 poll 	 ution 	 	.
 accord 	 ing 	 	to	paul	and	anne	ehrlich	and	a	well	-	known	 environment 	 al 	 	impact	 equ 	 ation 	 	,	impact	--	a	bad	thing	--	is	the	product	of	population	,	 af 	 flu 	 ence 	 	and	technology	.
that	is	,	impact	is	generated	by	people	,	what	they	 consum 	 e 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 af 	 flu 	 ence 	 	,	and	how	it	is	 produce 	 d 	 	.
and	 th 	 ough 	 	the	 equ 	 ation 	 	is	 large 	 ly 	 	 subject 	 ive 	 	,	you	can	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 quant 	 ify 	 	people	,	and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 quant 	 ify 	 	 af 	 flu 	 ence 	 	,	but	technology	is	 a 	 bus 	 ive 	 	in	too	 man 	 y 	 	ways	to	 quant 	 ify 	 	.
so	the	 equ 	 ation 	 	is	conceptual	.
still	it	 work 	 s 	 	to	help	us	understand	the	problem	.
so	we	set	out	at	 inter 	 face 	 	,	in	1994	,	to	create	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	:	to	transform	the	way	we	made	carpet	,
a	petroleum	-	intensive	product	for	 material 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	energy	,
and	to	transform	our	 techno 	 logies 	 	so	they	 diminish 	 ed 	 	 environment 	 al 	 	impact	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 multi 	 plied 	 	it	.
paul	and	anne	ehrlich	's	 environment 	 al 	 	impact	 equ 	 ation 	 	:	i	is	equal	to	p	 time 	 s 	 	a	 time 	 s 	 	t	:
population	,	 af 	 flu 	 ence 	 	and	technology	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	 inter 	 face 	 	to	 re 	 write 	 	that	 equ 	 ation 	 	so	that	it	read	i	 equal 	 s 	 	p	 time 	 s 	 	a	 divid 	 ed 	 	by	t	.
now	,	the	 mathematic 	 ally 	 	-	minded	will	see	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	that	t	in	the	 nume 	 rator 	 	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	impact	--	a	bad	thing	--
but	t	in	the	 denomi 	 nator 	 	 de 	 crease 	 s 	 	impact	.
so	i	ask	,	``	what	would	move	t	,	technology	,	from	the	 nume 	 rator 	 	--	call	it	t	1	--	where	it	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	impact	,	to	the	 denomi 	 nator 	 	--	call	it	t	2	--	where	it	 reduc 	 es 	 	impact	?
i	thought	about	the	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	of	first	industrial	revolution	,	t	1	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	 practice 	 d 	 	it	at	 inter 	 face 	 	,	and	it	had	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	.
 extr 	 active 	 	:	taking	raw	 material 	 s 	 	from	the	earth	.
linear	:	take	,	make	,	waste	.
powered	by	fossil	fuel	-	derived	energy	.
 waste 	 ful 	 	:	 a 	 bus 	 ive 	 	and	focused	on	labor	 product 	 ivity 	 	.
more	carpet	per	man	-	hour	.
 think 	 ing 	 	it	through	,	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 attribut 	 es 	 	must	be	 change 	 d 	 	to	move	t	to	the	 denomi 	 nator 	 	.
in	the	new	industrial	revolution	 extr 	 active 	 	must	be	 replace 	 d 	 	by	 renew 	 able 	 	;	linear	by	 cycl 	 ical 	 	;	fossil	fuel	energy	by	 renew 	 able 	 	energy	,	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	;
 waste 	 ful 	 	by	waste	-	free	;
and	 a 	 bus 	 ive 	 	by	benign	;
and	labor	 product 	 ivity 	 	by	resource	 product 	 ivity 	 	.
and	i	 reason 	 ed 	 	that	if	we	could	make	 t 	 hose 	 	 transform 	 ative 	 	 change 	 s 	 	,	and	get	rid	of	t	1	 al 	 together 	 	,	we	could	 reduc 	 e 	 	our	impact	to	zero	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	our	impact	on	the	climate	.
and	that	 be 	 came 	 	the	 inter 	 face 	 	plan	in	1995	,
and	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	the	plan	ever	since	.
we	have	 measur 	 ed 	 	our	progress	 ver 	 y 	 	 rigor 	 ously 	 	.
so	i	can	tell	you	how	far	we	have	come	in	the	 en 	 suing 	 	12	 year 	 s 	 	.
net	 green 	 house 	 	gas	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	down	82	percent	in	absolute	 ton 	 n 	 age 	 	.
over	the	same	span	of	time	 sale 	 s 	 	have	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	by	two	-	 third 	 s 	 	and	 profit 	 s 	 	have	 double 	 d 	 	.
so	an	82	percent	absolute	 r 	 eduction 	 	 transl 	 ates 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	90	percent	 r 	 eduction 	 	in	 green 	 house 	 	gas	 intens 	 ity 	 	 relat 	 ive 	 	to	 sale 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 magn 	 itude 	 	of	the	 r 	 eduction 	 	the	entire	global	 techno 	 sphere 	 	must	 real 	 ize 	 	by	2050	to	avoid	 catastroph 	 ic 	 	climate	 disrupt 	 ion 	 	--
so	the	 scientist 	 s 	 	are	 tell 	 ing 	 	us	.
fossil	fuel	 us 	 age 	 	is	down	60	percent	per	unit	of	production	,	due	to	efficiencies	in	 renew 	 able 	 s 	 	.
the	 cheap 	 est 	 	,	most	secure	barrel	of	oil	there	is	is	the	one	not	used	through	efficiencies	.
water	 us 	 age 	 	is	down	75	percent	in	our	 world 	 wide 	 	carpet	tile	business	.
down	40	percent	in	our	 broad 	 loom 	 	carpet	business	,	which	we	 acquir 	 ed 	 	in	1993	right	here	in	california	,	city	of	industry	,	where	water	is	so	precious	.
 renew 	 able 	 	or	 recycl 	 able 	 	 material 	 s 	 	are	25	percent	of	the	total	,	and	growing	 rapid 	 ly 	 	.
 renew 	 able 	 	energy	is	27	percent	of	our	total	,	going	for	100	percent	.
we	have	 divert 	 ed 	 	148	million	 pound 	 s 	 	--	that	's	74,000	 ton 	 s 	 	--	of	used	carpet	from	 land 	 fill 	 s 	 	,

 t 	 hose 	 	new	 cycl 	 ical 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	have	 con 	 tribute 	 d 	 	 might 	 ily 	 	to	the	fact	that	we	have	 produce 	 d 	 	and	 s 	 old 	 	85	million	square	 yard 	 s 	 	of	climate	-	neutral	carpet	since	2004	,

 in 	 dependent 	 	third	-	party	 cert 	 ified 	 	.
we	call	it	cool	carpet	.
and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	 power 	 ful 	 	 market 	 place 	 	 different 	 i 	 ator 	 	,	increasing	 sale 	 s 	 	and	 profit 	 s 	 	.

it	is	practical	,	and	 pre 	 tty 	 	too	.
we	reckon	that	we	are	a	bit	over	 half 	 way 	 	to	our	goal	:	zero	impact	,	zero	 foot 	 print 	 	.
we	've	set	2020	 a 	 s 	 	our	target	year	for	zero	,	for	 reach 	 ing 	 	the	top	,	the	 summ 	 it 	 	of	mount	 sustain 	 ability 	 	.
we	call	 th 	 is 	 	mission	zero	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	facet	:
we	have	found	mission	zero	to	be	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	good	for	business	.
a	better	business	model	,
a	better	way	to	 big 	 ger 	 	 profit 	 s 	 	.
here	is	the	business	case	for	 sustain 	 ability 	 	.
from	real	life	experience	,	 cost 	 s 	 	are	down	,	not	up	,	 reflect 	 ing 	 	some	400	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	of	 avoid 	 ed 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	in	 pur 	 suit 	 	of	zero	waste	--

 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	paid	all	the	 cost 	 s 	 	for	the	 transform 	 ation 	 	of	 inter 	 face 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 dis 	 pel 	 s 	 	a	myth	too	,	 th 	 is 	 	false	choice	between	the	environment	and	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
our	 product 	 s 	 	are	the	best	they	've	ever	 be 	 en 	 	,	inspired	by	design	for	 sustain 	 ability 	 	,	an	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	 well 	 spring 	 	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	.

what	else	is	there	?	it	is	a	better	business	model	.
and	here	is	our	14	-	year	record	of	 sale 	 s 	 	and	 profit 	 s 	 	.
there	is	a	dip	there	,	from	2001	to	2003	:	a	dip	when	our	 sale 	 s 	 	,	over	a	three	-	year	period	,	 we 	 re 	 	down	17	percent	.
but	the	 market 	 place 	 	was	down	36	percent	.
we	 liter 	 ally 	 	 gain 	 ed 	 	market	share	.
we	might	not	have	 surviv 	 ed 	 	that	 recess 	 ion 	 	but	for	the	 advantage 	 s 	 	of	 sustain 	 ability 	 	.
if	every	business	 we 	 re 	 	 pur 	 suing 	 	 inter 	 face 	 	 plan 	 s 	 	,	would	that	solve	all	our	 problem 	 s 	 	?
i	do	n't	think	so	.
