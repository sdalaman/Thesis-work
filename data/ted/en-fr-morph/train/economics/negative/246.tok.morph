the	first	idea	i	'd	like	to	suggest	is	that	we	all	love	music	a	great	deal	.	it	 mean 	 s 	 	a	lot	to	us	.
but	music	is	even	more	 power 	 ful 	 	if	you	do	n't	just	listen	to	it	,	but	you	make	it	 your 	 self 	 	.
so	,	that	's	my	first	idea	.	and	we	all	know	about	the	mozart	effect	--	the	idea	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	around	for	the	last	five	to	10	 year 	 s 	 	--	that	just	by	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	music	or	by	 play 	 ing 	 	music	to	your	baby	[	in	 ut 	 ero 	 	]	,	that	it	'll	raise	our	iq	 point 	 s 	 	10	,	20	,	30	percent	.
great	idea	,	but	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	at	all	.
so	,	you	ca	n't	just	listen	to	music	,	you	have	to	make	it	 some 	 how 	 	.
and	i	'd	add	to	that	,	that	it	's	not	just	making	it	,	but	 every 	 body 	 	,	each	of	us	,	 every 	 body 	 	in	the	world	 ha 	 s 	 	the	power	to	create	and	be	part	of	music	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	dynamic	way	,	and	that	's	one	of	the	main	 part 	 s 	 	of	my	work	.
so	,	with	the	mit	media	lab	,	for	 quit 	 e 	 	a	while	now	,	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 engag 	 ed 	 	in	a	field	 call 	 ed 	 	active	music	.
what	are	all	the	possible	ways	that	we	can	think	of	to	get	 every 	 body 	 	in	the	middle	of	a	musical	experience	,	not	just	 listen 	 ing 	 	,	but	making	music	?
and	we	 start 	 ed 	 	by	making	 instrument 	 s 	 	for	some	of	the	world	's	 great 	 est 	 	 perform 	 ers 	 	--	we	call	these	hyperinstruments	--	for	yo	-	yo	ma	,	peter	gabriel	,	prince	,	 orchestra 	 s 	 	,	rock	 band 	 s 	 	.	 instrument 	 s 	 	where	they	're	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 sensor 	 s 	 	built	right	 in 	 to 	 	the	instrument	,	so	the	instrument	 know 	 s 	 	how	it	's	 be 	 ing 	 	 play 	 ed 	 	.
and	just	by	changing	the	 interpret 	 ation 	 	and	the	 feel 	 ing 	 	,	i	can	turn	my	cello	 in 	 to 	 	a	voice	,	or	 in 	 to 	 	a	whole	orchestra	,	or	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 no 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	heard	before	.
when	we	 start 	 ed 	 	making	these	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	,	why	ca	n't	we	make	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 instrument 	 s 	 	like	that	for	 every 	 body 	 	,	people	who	are	n't	fantastic	yo	-	yo	mas	or	 prince 	 s 	 	?
so	,	we	've	made	a	whole	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 instrument 	 s 	 	.
one	of	the	largest	 collect 	 ions 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	brain	opera	.
it	's	a	whole	orchestra	of	about	100	 instrument 	 s 	 	,	all	designed	for	 any 	 body 	 	to	play	using	natural	skill	.
so	,	you	can	play	a	video	game	,	drive	through	a	piece	of	music	,	use	your	body	 gest 	 ure 	 	to	control	huge	 masse 	 s 	 	of	sound	,	touch	a	special	surface	to	make	 melo 	 dies 	 	,	use	your	voice	to	make	a	whole	aura	.
and	when	we	make	the	brain	opera	,	we	 invit 	 e 	 	the	public	to	come	in	,	to	try	these	 instrument 	 s 	 	and	then	 collabor 	 ate 	 	with	us	to	help	make	each	performance	of	the	brain	opera	.
we	 tour 	 ed 	 	that	for	a	long	time	.	it	is	now	 permanent 	 ly 	 	in	vienna	,	where	we	built	a	museum	around	it	.
and	that	led	to	 some 	 thing 	 	which	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	do	know	.
guitar	hero	came	out	of	our	lab	,	and	my	two	 teen 	 age 	 	 daughter 	 s 	 	and	most	of	the	 student 	 s 	 	at	the	mit	media	lab	are	proof	that	if	you	make	the	right	kind	of	 inter 	 face 	 	,	people	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 be 	 ing 	 	in	the	middle	of	a	piece	of	music	,	and	 play 	 ing 	 	it	over	and	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	.
so	,	the	model	 work 	 s 	 	,	but	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	the	tip	of	the	 ice 	 berg 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	my	second	idea	is	that	it	's	not	 en 	 ough 	 	just	to	want	to	make	music	in	 some 	 thing 	 	like	guitar	hero	.
and	music	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 f 	 un 	 	,	but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 transform 	 ative 	 	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
music	can	change	your	life	,	more	than	 al 	 most 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	.
it	can	change	the	way	you	communicate	with	 other 	 s 	 	,	it	can	change	your	body	,	it	can	change	your	mind	.	so	,	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	go	to	the	next	step	of	how	you	build	on	top	of	 some 	 thing 	 	like	guitar	hero	.
we	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	education	.	we	have	a	long	-	term	project	 call 	 ed 	 	 to 	 y 	 	 sym 	 phony 	 	,	where	we	make	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 instrument 	 s 	 	that	are	 al 	 so 	 	 addict 	 ive 	 	,	but	for	little	 kid 	 s 	 	,	so	the	 kid 	 s 	 	will	fall	in	love	with	making	music	,	want	to	 s 	 pend 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	time	 do 	 ing 	 	it	,	and	then	will	demand	to	know	how	it	 work 	 s 	 	,	how	to	make	more	,	how	to	create	.	so	,	we	make	squeezy	 instrument 	 s 	 	,	like	these	music	 shape 	 rs 	 	that	measure	the	 electric 	 ity 	 	in	your	 finger 	 s 	 	,	beatbugs	that	let	you	tap	in	 rhythm 	 s 	 	--	they	gather	your	rhythm	,	and	like	hot	potato	,	you	 s 	 end 	 	your	rhythm	to	your	 friend 	 s 	 	,	who	then	have	to	 imit 	 ate 	 	or	respond	to	what	your	 do 	 ing 	 	--	and	a	 soft 	 ware 	 	package	 call 	 ed 	 	hyperscore	,	which	lets	 any 	 body 	 	use	lines	and	color	to	make	 quit 	 e 	 	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	music	.	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	easy	to	use	,	but	once	you	use	it	,	you	can	go	 quit 	 e 	 	deep	--	music	in	any	style	.	and	then	,	by	 press 	 ing 	 	a	button	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	music	 not 	 ation 	 	so	that	live	 music 	 ians 	 	can	play	your	 piece 	 s 	 	.
we	've	had	good	 en 	 ough 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	 effect 	 s 	 	with	 kid 	 s 	 	around	the	world	,	and	now	people	of	all	 age 	 s 	 	,	using	hyperscore	.
so	,	we	've	gotten	more	and	more	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	using	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	creative	 activ 	 ities 	 	in	a	much	 broad 	 er 	 	 con 	 text 	 	,	for	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	people	who	do	n't	 usual 	 ly 	 	have	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	make	music	.
so	,	one	of	the	growing	 field 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	on	at	the	media	lab	right	now	is	music	,	mind	and	health	.
a	lot	of	you	have	 prob 	 ably 	 	 s 	 een 	 	oliver	 s 	 ack 	 s 	 	'	 wonder 	 ful 	 	new	book	 call 	 ed 	 	``	musicophilia	``	.	it	's	on	sale	in	the	 book 	 store 	 	.	it	's	a	great	book	.
if	you	have	n't	 s 	 een 	 	it	,	it	's	worth	 read 	 ing 	 	.	he	's	a	pianist	 him 	 self 	 	,	and	he	 detail 	 s 	 	his	whole	 care 	 er 	 	of	looking	at	and	 observ 	 ing 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	 effect 	 s 	 	that	music	 ha 	 s 	 	had	on	 people 	 s 	 	'	 live 	 s 	 	in	 un 	 usual 	 	 situ 	 ations 	 	.
so	we	know	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	that	music	is	 al 	 most 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	the	last	thing	that	people	with	 advance 	 d 	 	alzheimer	's	can	still	respond	to	.
 may 	 be 	 	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	have	 notice 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	with	 love 	 d 	 	 one 	 s 	 	,	you	can	find	 some 	 body 	 	who	ca	n't	 recogn 	 ize 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	face	in	the	mirror	,	or	ca	n't	tell	 any 	 one 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	family	,	but	you	can	still	find	a	 s 	 hard 	 	of	music	that	that	person	will	jump	out	of	the	chair	and	start	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	.	and	with	that
you	can	 br 	 ing 	 	back	 part 	 s 	 	of	people	's	 memor 	 ies 	 	and	 personal 	 ities 	 	.
music	is	the	best	way	to	 re 	 store 	 	speech	to	people	who	have	lost	it	through	 stroke 	 s 	 	,	 move 	 ment 	 	to	people	with	parkinson	's	disease	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	for	 depress 	 ion 	 	,	 schizo 	 phrenia 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
so	,	we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 understand 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	 principle 	 s 	 	and	then	building	 activ 	 ities 	 	which	will	let	music	 re 	 ally 	 	improve	people	's	health	.
and	we	do	 th 	 is 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	.	we	work	with	 man 	 y 	 	different	 hospital 	 s 	 	.
one	of	them	is	right	near	boston	,	 call 	 ed 	 	tewksbury	hospital	.
it	's	a	long	-	term	state	hospital	,	where	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 year 	 s 	 	ago	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	with	hyperscore	and	 patient 	 s 	 	with	physical	and	mental	 dis 	 abilities 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	a	central	part	of	the	 treat 	 ment 	 	at	tewksbury	hospital	,	so	 every 	 body 	 	there	clamors	to	work	on	musical	 activ 	 ities 	 	.
it	's	the	activity	that	 seem 	 s 	 	to	 accele 	 rate 	 	people	's	 treat 	 ment 	 	the	most
and	it	 al 	 so 	 	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	the	entire	hospital	together	 a 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	musical	community	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	show	you	a	quick	video	of	some	of	 th 	 is 	 	work	before	i	go	on	.
video	:	they	're	 manipul 	 ating 	 	each	other	's	 rhythm 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	real	experience	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	to	learn	how	to	play	and	listen	to	 rhythm 	 s 	 	,	but	to	train	your	musical	 memor 	 y 	 	and	 play 	 ing 	 	music	in	a	group	.
to	get	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	on	music	,	to	shape	it	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	change	it	,	to	experiment	with	it	,	to	make	 the 	 ir 	 	own	music	.
so	hyperscore	lets	you	start	from	scratch	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
 every 	 body 	 	can	experience	music	in	a	 pro 	 found 	 	way	,	we	just	have	to	make	different	 tool 	 s 	 	.
the	third	idea	i	want	to	share	with	you	is	that	music	,	 paradox 	 ically 	 	,	i	think	even	more	than	 word 	 s 	 	,	is	one	of	the	 ver 	 y 	 	best	ways	we	have	of	 show 	 ing 	 	who	we	 re 	 ally 	 	are	.	i	love	giving	 talk 	 s 	 	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	 strange 	 ly 	 	i	feel	more	nervous	giving	 talk 	 s 	 	than	 play 	 ing 	 	music	.
if	i	 we 	 re 	 	here	 play 	 ing 	 	cello	,	or	 play 	 ing 	 	on	a	synth	,	or	sharing	my	music	with	you	,	i	'd	be	able	to	show	 thing 	 s 	 	about	 my 	 self 	 	that	i	ca	n't	tell	you	in	 word 	 s 	 	,	more	personal	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 deep 	 er 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
i	think	that	's	true	for	 man 	 y 	 	of	us	,	and	i	want	to	give	you	two	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	how	music	is	one	of	the	most	 power 	 ful 	 	 inter 	 face 	 s 	 	we	have	,	from	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	the	 out 	 side 	 	world	.
the	first	is	a	 re 	 ally 	 	crazy	project	that	we	're	building	right	now	,	 call 	 ed 	 	death	and	the	 power 	 s 	 	.	and	it	's	a	big	opera	,	one	of	the	 large 	 r 	 	opera	 project 	 s 	 	going	on	in	the	world	right	now	.
and	it	's	about	a	man	,	rich	,	 success 	 ful 	 	,	 power 	 ful 	 	,	who	 want 	 s 	 	to	live	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
so	,	he	 figure 	 s 	 	out	a	way	to	download	 him 	 self 	 	 in 	 to 	 	his	environment	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 book 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	guy	 want 	 s 	 	to	live	 fore 	 ver 	 	,	he	 download 	 s 	 	 him 	 self 	 	 in 	 to 	 	his	environment	.
the	main	 s 	 ing 	 er 	 	 disappear 	 s 	 	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	opera	and	the	entire	stage	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	the	main	character	.	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	his	 leg 	 acy 	 	.
and	the	opera	is	about	what	we	can	share	,	what	we	can	pass	on	to	 other 	 s 	 	,	to	the	people	we	love	,	and	what	we	ca	n't	.
every	object	in	the	opera	 come 	 s 	 	 al 	 ive 	 	and	is	a	 gig 	 antic 	 	music	instrument	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	 chan 	 deli 	 er 	 	.	it	 take 	 s 	 	up	the	whole	stage	.	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	 chan 	 deli 	 er 	 	,	but	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	robotic	music	instrument	.
so	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	in	 th 	 is 	 	prototype	,	 gig 	 antic 	 	piano	 string 	 s 	 	,	each	string	is	controlled	with	a	little	robotic	element	--	either	little	bows	that	stroke	the	 string 	 s 	 	,	propellers	that	tickle	the	 string 	 s 	 	,	acoustic	 signal 	 s 	 	that	 vib 	 rate 	 	the	 string 	 s 	 	.	we	 al 	 so 	 	have	an	 arm 	 y 	 	of	 robot 	 s 	 	on	stage	.
these	 robot 	 s 	 	are	the	kind	of	the	 inter 	 media 	 ry 	 	between	the	main	character	,	simon	 power 	 s 	 	,	and	his	family	.	there	are	a	whole	 s 	 eries 	 	of	them	,	kind	of	like	a	greek	 chor 	 us 	 	.
they	 observ 	 e 	 	the	action	.	we	've	designed	these	square	 robot 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 test 	 ing 	 	right	now	at	mit	 call 	 ed 	 	operabots	.	these	operabots	follow	my	music	.
they	follow	the	 character 	 s 	 	.	they	're	smart	 en 	 ough 	 	,	we	hope	,	not	to	bump	 in 	 to 	 	each	other	.	they	go	off	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	.
and	then	they	can	 al 	 so 	 	,	when	you	snap	,	line	up	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	way	you	'd	like	to	.
even	 th 	 ough 	 	they	're	 cube 	 s 	 	,	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	a	lot	of	 personal 	 ity 	 	.
the	largest	set	piece	in	the	opera	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	system	.	it	's	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 book 	 s 	 	.
every	single	book	is	robotic	,	so	they	all	move	,	they	all	make	sound	,	and	when	you	put	them	all	together	,	they	turn	 in 	 to 	 	these	 wall 	 s 	 	,	which	have	the	 gest 	 ure 	 	and	the	 personal 	 ity 	 	of	simon	 power 	 s 	 	.	so	he	's	 disappear 	 ed 	 	,	but	the	whole	physical	environment	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	person	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	how	he	's	 chose 	 n 	 	to	represent	 him 	 self 	 	.
the	 book 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	have	high	-	 pack 	 ed 	 	leds	on	the	 spin 	 es 	 	.	so	it	's	all	 dis 	 play 	 	.
and	here	's	the	great	baritone	james	maddalena	 a 	 s 	 	he	 enter 	 s 	 	the	system	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	sneak	 pre 	 view 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 premiere 	 s 	 	in	monaco	--	it	's	in	september	2009	.	if	by	any	chance	you	ca	n't	make	it	,	 an 	 other 	 	idea	with	 th 	 is 	 	project	--	here	's	 th 	 is 	 	guy	building	his	 leg 	 acy 	 	through	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 usual 	 	form	,	through	music	and	through	the	environment	.
but	we	're	 al 	 so 	 	making	 th 	 is 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	both	 on 	 line 	 	and	in	public	 space 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	way	of	each	of	us	to	use	music	and	 image 	 s 	 	from	our	 live 	 s 	 	to	make	our	own	 leg 	 acy 	 	or	to	make	a	 leg 	 acy 	 	of	 some 	 one 	 	we	love	.
so	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	grand	opera	,	 th 	 is 	 	opera	will	turn	 in 	 to 	 	what	we	're	 think 	 ing 	 	of	 a 	 s 	 	personal	opera	.
and	,	if	you	're	going	to	make	a	personal	opera	,	what	about	a	personal	instrument	?
 every 	 thing 	 	i	've	 show 	 n 	 	you	so	far	--	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	a	hyper	-	cello	for	yo	-	yo	ma	or	squeezy	 to 	 y 	 	for	a	child	--	the	 instrument 	 s 	 	 stay 	 ed 	 	the	same	and	are	 valu 	 able 	 	for	a	certain	class	of	person	:	a	 virtuos 	 o 	 	,	a	child	.
but	what	if	i	could	make	an	instrument	that	could	be	 adapt 	 ed 	 	to	the	way	i	 personal 	 ly 	 	 behav 	 e 	 	,	to	the	way	my	 hand 	 s 	 	work	,	to	what	i	do	 ver 	 y 	 	 skill 	 fully 	 	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	to	what	i	do	n't	do	so	 skill 	 fully 	 	?
i	think	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	future	of	 inter 	 face 	 	,	it	's	the	future	of	music	,	the	future	of	 instrument 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'd	like	now	to	 invit 	 e 	 	two	 ver 	 y 	 	special	people	on	the	stage	,	so	that	i	can	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	what	personal	 instrument 	 s 	 	might	be	like	.
so	,	can	you	give	a	hand	to	adam	boulanger	,	ph.d.	student	from	the	mit	media	lab	,	and	dan	ellsey	.	dan	,	 thank 	 s 	 	to	ted	and	to	 bombard 	 ier 	 	flexjet	,	dan	is	here	with	us	 to 	 day 	 	all	the	way	from	tewksbury	.	he	's	a	resident	at	tewksbury	hospital	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	by	far	the	 far 	 th 	 est 	 	he	's	 s 	 tray 	 ed 	 	from	tewksbury	hospital	,	i	can	tell	you	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	's	 motiv 	 ated 	 	to	meet	with	you	 to 	 day 	 	and	show	you	his	own	music	.
so	,	first	of	all	,	dan	,	do	you	want	to	say	hi	to	 every 	 one 	 	and	tell	 every 	 one 	 	who	you	are	?
dan	ellsey	:	 hell 	 o 	 	.	my	name	is	dan	ellsey	.	i	am	34	 year 	 s 	 	old	and	i	have	cerebral	 pal 	 s 	 y 	 	.
i	have	 al 	 ways 	 	 love 	 d 	 	music	and	i	am	 excit 	 ed 	 	to	be	able	to	conduct	my	own	music	with	 th 	 is 	 	new	 soft 	 ware 	 	.
tod	machover	:	and	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	to	have	you	here	,	 re 	 ally 	 	dan	.
so	we	met	dan	about	three	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	three	and	a	half	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	when	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	at	tewksbury	.	 every 	 body 	 	we	met	there	was	fantastic	,	did	fantastic	music	.	dan	had	never	made	music	before	,	and	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	he	was	 re 	 ally 	 	fantastic	at	it	.	he	's	a	born	 compose 	 r 	 	.
he	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 hy 	 	,	too	.
so	,	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	he	's	a	fantastic	 compose 	 r 	 	,	and	over	the	last	few	 year 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	constant	 collabor 	 ator 	 	of	 our 	 s 	 	.	he	 ha 	 s 	 	made	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 piece 	 s 	 	.
he	 make 	 s 	 	his	own	cds	.	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	he	is	 quit 	 e 	 	well	known	in	the	boston	area	--	 mentor 	 s 	 	people	at	the	hospital	and	children	,	 local 	 ly 	 	,	in	how	to	make	 the 	 ir 	 	own	music	.
and	i	'll	let	adam	tell	you	.	so	,	adam	is	a	ph.d.	student	at	mit	,	an	expert	in	music	technology	and	medicine	.	and	adam	and	dan	have	 be 	 come 	 	close	 collabor 	 ators 	 	.
what	adam	's	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	for	 th 	 is 	 	last	period	is	not	 on 	 ly 	 	how	to	have	dan	be	able	 eas 	 ily 	 	to	make	his	own	 piece 	 s 	 	,	but	how	he	can	perform	his	piece	using	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	personal	instrument	.
so	,	you	want	to	say	a	little	bit	about	how	you	 guy 	 s 	 	work	?
adam	boulanger	:	 y 	 es 	 	.	so	,	tod	and	i	 enter 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 discuss 	 ion 	 	 follow 	 ing 	 	the	tewksbury	work	and	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	about	how	dan	is	an	 express 	 ive 	 	person	,	and	he	's	an	intelligent	and	creative	person	.	and	it	's	in	his	face	,	it	's	in	his	 breath 	 ing 	 	,	it	's	in	his	 eye 	 s 	 	.	how	come	he	ca	n't	perform	one	of	his	 piece 	 s 	 	of	music	?	that	's	our	 respons 	 ibility 	 	,	and	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	sense	.
so	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 develop 	 ing 	 	a	technology	that	will	allow	him	with	nuance	,	with	 pre 	 cis 	 ion 	 	,	with	control	,	and	 de 	 spite 	 	his	physical	 dis 	 ability 	 	,	to	be	able	to	do	that	,	to	be	able	to	perform	his	piece	of	music	.
so	,	the	process	and	the	technology	--	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	first	we	 need 	 ed 	 	an	 engineer 	 ing 	 	solution	.	so	,	you	know	,
we	have	a	firewire	camera	,	it	 look 	 ed 	 	at	an	 infra 	 red 	 	 point 	 er 	 	.
we	went	with	the	type	of	 gest 	 ure 	 	metaphor	that	dan	was	 al 	 ready 	 	used	to	with	his	 s 	 peaking 	 	 controll 	 er 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	 l 	 east 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	part	of	the	work	,	you	know	,	the	design	process	.	we	 need 	 ed 	 	an	 in 	 put 	 	;	we	 need 	 ed 	 	 continu 	 ous 	 	 track 	 ing 	 	;
in	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	,	we	look	at	the	 type 	 s 	 	of	 shape 	 s 	 	he	's	making	.
but	,	then	was	the	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 a 	 spect 	 	of	the	work	,	 follow 	 ing 	 	the	 engineer 	 ing 	 	part	,	where	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	we	're	 cod 	 ing 	 	over	dan	's	shoulder	at	the	hospital	 extens 	 ively 	 	to	figure	out	,	you	know	,	how	 do 	 es 	 	dan	move	?
what	's	 use 	 ful 	 	to	him	 a 	 s 	 	an	 express 	 ive 	 	motion	?
you	know	,	what	's	his	metaphor	for	performance	?
what	 type 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	 do 	 es 	 	he	find	 import 	 ant 	 	to	control	and	convey	in	a	piece	of	music	?
so	all	the	parameter	fitting	,	and	 re 	 ally 	 	the	technology	was	 stretch 	 ed 	 	at	that	point	to	fit	just	dan	.
and	,	you	know	,	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	shift	.	it	's	not	that	our	 techno 	 logies 	 	--	they	provide	access	,	they	allow	us	to	create	 piece 	 s 	 	of	creative	work	.
but	what	about	 express 	 ion 	 	?	what	about	that	moment	when	an	artist	 deliver 	 s 	 
that	piece	of	work	?	you	know	,	do	our	 techno 	 logies 	 	allow	us	to	express	?
do	they	provide	structure	for	us	to	do	that	?	and	,	you	know	,	that	's	a	personal	relationship	to	 express 	 ion 	 	that	is	 lack 	 ing 	 	in	the	 techno 	 logical 	 	sphere	.	so	,	you	know	,
with	dan	,	we	 need 	 ed 	 	a	new	design	process	,	a	new	 engineer 	 ing 	 	process	to	sort	of	discover	his	 move 	 ment 	 	and	his	path	to	 express 	 ion 	 	that	allow	him	to	perform	.
and	so	that	's	what	we	'll	do	 to 	 day 	 	.
tm	:	so	let	's	do	it	.	so	dan	do	you	want	to	tell	 every 	 one 	 	about	what	you	're	going	to	play	now	?
de	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	``	my	eagle	song	.	``
tm	:	so	dan	is	going	to	play	a	piece	of	his	,	 call 	 ed 	 	``	my	eagle	song	``	.
in	fact	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	score	for	dan	's	piece	,	 complete 	 ly 	 	 compose 	 d 	 	by	dan	in	hyperscore	.
so	he	can	use	his	 infra 	 red 	 	 track 	 er 	 	to	go	 direct 	 ly 	 	 in 	 to 	 	hyperscore	.
he	's	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	fast	at	it	,	too	,	 fast 	 er 	 	than	i	am	,	in	fact	.
tm	:	he	's	 re 	 ally 	 	modest	,	too	.
so	he	can	go	in	hyperscore	.	you	start	out	by	making	 melo 	 dies 	 	and	 rhythm 	 s 	 	.
he	can	place	 t 	 hose 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	where	he	 want 	 s 	 	.
each	one	 get 	 s 	 	a	color	.	he	 go 	 es 	 	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	 com 	 position 	 	window	,	 draw 	 s 	 	the	lines	,	 place 	 s 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	the	way	he	 want 	 s 	 	to	.	looking	at	the	hyperscore	,	you	can	see	it	 al 	 so 	 	,	you	can	see	where	the	 section 	 s 	 	are	,	 some 	 thing 	 	might	 continu 	 e 	 	for	a	while	,	change	,	get	 re 	 ally 	 	crazy	and	then	end	up	with	a	big	bang	at	the	end	.
so	that	's	the	way	he	made	his	piece	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	adam	 say 	 s 	 	,	we	then	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	the	best	way	to	have	him	perform	his	piece	.
it	's	going	to	be	 look 	 ed 	 	at	by	 th 	 is 	 	camera	,	 analyz 	 e 	 	his	 move 	 ments 	 	,	it	's	going	to	let	dan	 br 	 ing 	 	out	all	the	different	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	of	his	music	that	he	 want 	 s 	 	to	.
and	you	're	 al 	 so 	 	going	to	notice	a	visual	on	the	screen	.
we	 ask 	 ed 	 	one	of	our	 student 	 s 	 	to	look	at	what	the	camera	is	 measur 	 ing 	 	.
but	 in 	 stead 	 	of	making	it	 ver 	 y 	 	 liter 	 al 	 	,	 show 	 ing 	 	you	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	camera	 trac 	 ing 	 	,	we	 turn 	 ed 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	graphic	that	 show 	 s 	 	you	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	,	and	 show 	 s 	 	the	way	it	's	 be 	 ing 	 	 analyz 	 ed 	 	.
i	think	it	 give 	 s 	 	an	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	how	we	're	 pick 	 ing 	 	out	 move 	 ment 	 	from	what	dan	's	 do 	 ing 	 	,	but	i	think	it	will	 al 	 so 	 	show	you	,	if	you	look	at	that	 move 	 ment 	 	,	that	when	dan	 make 	 s 	 	music	,	his	 motion 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 purpose 	 ful 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	precise	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 discipline 	 d 	 	and	they	're	 al 	 so 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
so	,	in	 hear 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	piece	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	before	,	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	is	the	music	's	great	,	and	it	'll	show	you	who	dan	is	.
so	,	are	we	ready	adam	?
ab	:	 yea 	 h 	 	.
tm	:	ok	,	now	dan	will	play	his	piece	``	my	eagle	song	``	for	you	.
tm	:	bravo	.
