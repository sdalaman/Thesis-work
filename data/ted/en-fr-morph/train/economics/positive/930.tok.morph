the	global	 challeng 	 e 	 	that	i	want	to	talk	to	you	about	 to 	 day 	 	 rare 	 ly 	 	 make 	 s 	 	the	front	 page 	 s 	 	.
it	,	 how 	 ever 	 	,	is	enormous	in	both	scale	and	 import 	 ance 	 	.
look	,	you	all	are	 ver 	 y 	 	well	 travel 	 ed 	 	;	 th 	 is 	 	is	tedglobal	after	all	.
but	i	do	hope	to	take	you	to	some	 place 	 s 	 	you	've	never	 be 	 en 	 	to	before	.
so	,	let	's	start	off	in	 chin 	 a 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	photo	was	taken	two	 week 	 s 	 	ago	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	one	 indic 	 ation 	 	is	that	little	boy	on	my	husband	's	 shoulder 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	just	 graduate 	 d 	 	from	high	school	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	tiananmen	square	.
 man 	 y 	 	of	you	have	 be 	 en 	 	there	.	it	's	not	the	real	 chin 	 a 	 	.
let	me	take	you	to	the	real	 chin 	 a 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	in	the	dabian	 mountain 	 s 	 	in	the	remote	part	of	hubei	 pro 	 vince 	 	in	central	 chin 	 a 	 	.
dai	manju	is	13	 year 	 s 	 	old	at	the	time	the	story	 start 	 s 	 	.
she	 live 	 s 	 	with	her	 parent 	 s 	 	,	her	two	 brother 	 s 	 	and	her	great	-	aunt	.
they	have	a	hut	that	 ha 	 s 	 	no	 electric 	 ity 	 	,	no	running	water	,	no	 wrist 	 watch 	 	,	no	 bi 	 cycle 	 	.
and	they	share	 th 	 is 	 	great	splendor	with	a	 ver 	 y 	 	large	pig	.
dai	manju	was	in	sixth	grade	when	her	 parent 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	're	going	to	pull	you	out	of	school	 be 	 cause 	 	the	13	-	dollar	school	 fee 	 s 	 	are	too	much	for	us	.
you	're	going	to	be	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	the	rest	of	your	life	in	the	rice	 padd 	 ies 	 	.
why	would	we	waste	 th 	 is 	 	money	on	you	?	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	 girl 	 s 	 	in	remote	 area 	 s 	 	.
 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	dai	manju	was	the	best	pupil	in	her	grade	.
she	still	made	the	two	-	hour	trek	to	the	 school 	 house 	 	and	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	catch	every	little	bit	of	information	that	 seep 	 ed 	 	out	of	the	 door 	 s 	 	.
we	wrote	about	her	in	the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	.
we	got	a	flood	of	 don 	 ations 	 	--	 most 	 ly 	 	13	-	dollar	 check 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	 read 	 ers 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 gen 	 er 	 ous 	 	in	 tin 	 y 	 	 amount 	 s 	 
but	then	,	we	got	a	money	transfer	for	$	10,000	--	 re 	 ally 	 	nice	guy	.
we	 turn 	 ed 	 	the	money	over	to	that	man	there	,	the	principal	of	the	school	.
he	was	 de 	 light 	 ed 	 	.
he	thought	,	``	oh	,	i	can	renovate	the	school	.
i	can	give	 scholar 	 ship 	 s 	 	to	all	the	 girl 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	if	they	work	hard	and	stay	in	school	.
so	dai	manju	 bas 	 ically 	 	 finish 	 ed 	 	out	middle	school	.
she	went	to	high	school	.
she	went	to	 voc 	 ation 	 al 	 	school	for	 account 	 ing 	 	.
she	 scout 	 ed 	 	for	 job 	 s 	 	down	in	guangdong	 pro 	 vince 	 	in	the	south	.
she	found	a	job	,	she	 scout 	 ed 	 	for	 job 	 s 	 	for	her	 class 	 mate 	 s 	 	and	her	 friend 	 s 	 	.
she	 s 	 ent 	 	money	back	to	her	family	.
they	built	a	new	house	,	 th 	 is 	 	time	with	running	water	,	 electric 	 ity 	 	,	a	 bi 	 cycle 	 	,	no	pig	.
what	we	saw	was	a	natural	experiment	.
it	is	rare	to	get	an	 exo 	 genous 	 	 invest 	 ment 	 	in	 girl 	 s 	 	'	education	.
and	over	the	 year 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	 follow 	 ed 	 	dai	manju	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	see	that	she	was	able	to	move	out	of	a	 vic 	 ious 	 	cycle	and	 in 	 to 	 	a	virtuous	cycle	.
she	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 change 	 d 	 	her	own	dynamic	,	she	 change 	 d 	 	her	 house 	 hold 	 	,	she	 change 	 d 	 	her	family	,	her	village	.
the	village	 be 	 came 	 	a	real	 stand 	 out 	 	.
of	course	,	most	of	 chin 	 a 	 	was	 flourish 	 ing 	 	at	the	time	,	but	they	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	get	a	road	built	to	link	them	up	to	the	rest	of	 chin 	 a 	 	.
and	that	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	me	to	my	first	major	of	two	 ten 	 et 	 s 	 	of	``	half	the	sky	.	``
and	that	is	that	the	central	moral	 challeng 	 e 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	century	is	gender	 in 	 equ 	 ity 	 	.
in	the	19th	century	,	it	was	 slave 	 ry 	 	.
in	the	20th	century	,	it	was	 total 	 itarianism 	 	.
the	cause	of	our	time	is	the	 brutal 	 ity 	 	that	so	 man 	 y 	 	people	face	around	the	world	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	gender	.
so	some	of	you	may	be	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	 go 	 sh 	 	,	that	's	 hyper 	 bo 	 le 	 	.
she	's	 exagge 	 rating 	 	.	``	well	,	let	me	ask	you	 th 	 is 	 	question	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	think	there	are	more	 male 	 s 	 	or	more	 female 	 s 	 	in	the	world	?
let	me	take	a	poll	.	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	think	there	are	more	 male 	 s 	 	in	the	world	?
 hand 	 s 	 	up	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	think	--	a	few	--	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	there	are	more	 female 	 s 	 	in	the	world	?
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	most	of	you	.
well	,	you	know	 th 	 is 	 	 lat 	 ter 	 	group	,	you	're	wrong	.
there	are	,	true	 en 	 ough 	 	,	in	europe	and	the	west	,	when	women	and	men	have	equal	access	to	food	and	health	care	,	there	are	more	women	,	we	live	 long 	 er 	 	.
but	in	most	of	the	rest	of	the	world	,	that	's	not	the	case	.
in	fact	,	 demo 	 graph 	 ers 	 	have	 show 	 n 	 	that	there	are	 any 	 where 	 	between	60	million	and	100	million	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	 female 	 s 	 	in	the	current	population	.
and	,	you	know	,	it	 happen 	 s 	 	for	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	.
for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	in	the	last	half	-	century	,	more	 girl 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 discriminate 	 d 	 	to	death	than	all	the	people	 kill 	 ed 	 	on	all	the	 battle 	 field 	 s 	 	in	the	20th	century	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 son 	 ogram 	 	.
 girl 	 s 	 	get	 abort 	 ed 	 	before	they	're	even	born	when	there	are	scarce	 resource 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	girl	here	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	is	in	a	 feed 	 ing 	 	center	in	ethiopia	.
the	entire	center	was	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	 girl 	 s 	 	like	her	.
what	's	 remark 	 able 	 	is	that	her	 brother 	 s 	 	,	in	the	same	family	,	 we 	 re 	 	 total 	 ly 	 	fine	.
in	india	,	in	the	first	year	of	life	,	from	zero	to	one	,	boy	and	girl	 bab 	 ies 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	 surviv 	 e 	 	at	the	same	rate	 be 	 cause 	 	they	depend	 up 	 on 	 	the	breast	,	and	the	breast	 show 	 s 	 	no	son	 pre 	 ference 	 	.
from	one	to	five	,	 girl 	 s 	 	die	at	a	50	percent	 high 	 er 	 	 mortal 	 ity 	 	rate	than	 boy 	 s 	 	,	in	all	of	india	.
the	second	 ten 	 et 	 	of	``	half	the	sky	``	is	that	,	let	's	put	 a 	 side 	 	the	 moral 	 ity 	 	of	all	the	right	and	wrong	of	it	all	,
and	just	on	a	 pur 	 e 	 ly 	 	practical	level	,	we	think	that	one	of	the	best	ways	to	fight	poverty	and	to	fight	 terror 	 ism 	 	is	to	 educ 	 ate 	 	 girl 	 s 	 	and	to	 br 	 ing 	 	women	 in 	 to 	 	the	 form 	 al 	 	labor	force	.
poverty	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	.
there	are	three	 reason 	 s 	 	why	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	case	.
for	one	,	 over 	 population 	 	is	one	of	the	 persist 	 ent 	 	 cause 	 s 	 	of	poverty	.
and	you	know	,	when	you	 educ 	 ate 	 	a	boy	,	his	family	 tend 	 s 	 	to	have	 few 	 er 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	,	but	 on 	 ly 	 	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	.
when	you	 educ 	 ate 	 	a	girl	,	she	 tend 	 s 	 	to	have	 significant 	 ly 	 	 few 	 er 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	.
the	second	reason	is	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	with	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	kind	of	like	the	 dirt 	 y 	 	,	little	secret	of	poverty	,	which	is	that	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	do	poor	people	take	in	 ver 	 y 	 	little	income	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	,	the	income	that	they	take	in	,	they	do	n't	 s 	 pend 	 	it	 ver 	 y 	 	 wise 	 ly 	 	,
and	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	most	of	that	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	is	 d 	 one 	 	by	men	.
so	research	 ha 	 s 	 	 show 	 n 	 	,	if	you	look	at	people	who	live	under	two	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	day	--	one	metric	of	poverty	--	two	percent	of	that	take	-	home	pay	 go 	 es 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	basket	here	,	in	education	.
20	percent	 go 	 es 	 	to	a	basket	that	is	a	combination	of	alcohol	,	tobacco	,	 sugar 	 y 	 	 drink 	 s 	 	--	and	 pro 	 stit 	 ution 	 	and	 fest 	 ival 	 s 	 	.
if	you	just	take	four	 percent 	 age 	 	 point 	 s 	 	and	put	it	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	basket	,	you	would	have	a	 transform 	 ative 	 	effect	.
the	last	reason	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	with	women	 be 	 ing 	 	part	of	the	solution	,	not	the	problem	.
you	need	to	use	scarce	 resource 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	waste	of	 resource 	 s 	 	if	you	do	n't	use	 some 	 one 	 	like	dai	manju	.
bill	 gate 	 s 	 	put	it	 ver 	 y 	 	well	when	he	was	 travel 	 ing 	 	through	saudi	arabia	.
he	was	 s 	 peaking 	 	to	an	audience	much	like	 your 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	two	-	 third 	 s 	 	of	the	way	there	was	a	 bar 	 rier 	 	.
on	 th 	 is 	 	side	was	men	,	and	then	the	 bar 	 rier 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	side	was	women	.
and	 some 	 one 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	side	of	the	room	got	up	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	mr.	 gate 	 s 	 	,	we	have	here	 a 	 s 	 	our	goal	in	saudi	arabia	to	be	one	of	the	top	10	 count 	 ries 	 	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	technology	.
do	you	think	we	'll	make	it	?	``	so	bill	 gate 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	he	was	 star 	 ing 	 	out	at	the	audience	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	if	you	're	not	fully	 util 	 izing 	 	half	the	 resource 	 s 	 	in	your	country	,	there	is	no	way	you	will	get	 any 	 where 	 	near	the	top	10.	``	so	here	is	bill	of	arabia	.
so	what	would	some	of	the	specific	 challeng 	 es 	 	look	like	?
i	would	say	,	on	the	top	of	the	agenda	is	 s 	 ex 	 	 traffic 	 king 	 	.
and	i	'll	just	say	two	 thing 	 s 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
the	 slave 	 ry 	 	at	the	peak	of	the	slave	trade	in	the	1780s	:	there	 we 	 re 	 	about	80,000	 slave 	 s 	 	 transport 	 ed 	 	from	africa	to	the	new	world	.
now	,	modern	 slave 	 ry 	 	:	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	state	 depart 	 ment 	 	rough	 statistic 	 s 	 	,	there	are	about	800,000	--	10	 time 	 s 	 	the	number	--	that	are	 traffic 	 ked 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	 inter 	 national 	 	 border 	 s 	 	.
and	that	 do 	 es 	 	not	even	include	 t 	 hose 	 	that	are	 traffic 	 ked 	 	 with 	 in 	 	country	 border 	 s 	 	,	which	is	a	 sub 	 stantial 	 	 port 	 ion 	 	.
and	if	you	look	at	 an 	 other 	 	factor	,	 an 	 other 	 	contrast	,	a	slave	back	then	is	worth	about	$	40,000	in	 to 	 day 	 	's	money	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	you	can	buy	a	girl	 traffic 	 ked 	 	for	a	few	hundred	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	she	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	more	 dispos 	 able 	 	.
but	you	know	,	there	is	progress	 be 	 ing 	 	made	in	 place 	 s 	 	like	cambodia	and	thailand	.
we	do	n't	have	to	expect	a	world	where	 girl 	 s 	 	are	 b 	 ought 	 	and	 s 	 old 	 	or	 kill 	 ed 	 	.
the	second	item	on	the	agenda	is	 ma 	 ternal 	 	 mortal 	 ity 	 	.
you	know	,	 child 	 birth 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	part	of	the	world	is	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	event	.
in	niger	,	one	in	seven	women	can	expect	to	die	 dur 	 ing 	 	 child 	 birth 	 	.
around	the	world	,	one	woman	dies	every	minute	and	a	half	from	 child 	 birth 	 	.
you	know	,	it	's	not	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	we	do	n't	have	the	 techno 	 logical 	 	solution	,	but	these	women	have	three	 strike 	 s 	 	against	them	:	they	are	poor	,	they	are	 r 	 ural 	 	and	they	are	female	.
you	know	,	for	every	woman	who	 do 	 es 	 	die	,	there	are	20	who	 surviv 	 e 	 	but	end	up	with	an	 in 	 jury 	 	.
and	the	most	 deva 	 stat 	 ing 	 	 in 	 jury 	 	is	obstetric	 fist 	 ula 	 	.
it	's	a	 tear 	 ing 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	 obstruct 	 ed 	 	labor	that	 leav 	 es 	 	a	woman	 in 	 continent 	 	.
let	me	tell	you	about	mahabuba	.
she	 live 	 s 	 	in	ethiopia	.
she	was	married	against	her	will	at	age	13	.
she	got	 pregn 	 ant 	 	,	ran	to	the	bush	to	have	the	baby	,	but	you	know	,	her	body	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 im 	 mature 	 	,	and	she	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 hav 	 ing 	 	 obstruct 	 ed 	 	labor	.
the	baby	 di 	 ed 	 	,	and	she	 end 	 ed 	 	up	with	a	 fist 	 ula 	 	.
so	that	 me 	 ant 	 	she	was	 in 	 continent 	 	;	she	could	n't	control	her	 waste 	 s 	 	.
in	a	word	,	she	 s 	 tank 	 	.
the	 village 	 rs 	 	thought	she	was	 cur 	 s 	 ed 	 	;	they	did	n't	know	what	to	do	with	her	.
so	 final 	 ly 	 	,	they	put	her	at	the	edge	of	the	village	in	a	hut	.
they	 rip 	 ped 	 	off	the	door	so	that	the	 hyena 	 s 	 	would	get	her	at	night	.
that	night	,	there	was	a	stick	in	the	hut	.
she	 f 	 ought 	 	off	the	 hyena 	 s 	 	with	that	stick	.
and	the	next	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	she	 k 	 new 	 	if	she	could	get	to	a	 near 	 by 	 	village	where	there	was	a	foreign	 mission 	 ary 	 	,	she	would	be	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	she	had	some	damage	to	her	 nerve 	 s 	 	,	she	 crawl 	 ed 	 	all	the	way	--	30	 mile 	 s 	 	--	to	that	 door 	 step 	 	,	half	dead	.
the	foreign	 mission 	 ary 	 	 open 	 ed 	 	the	door	,	 k 	 new 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	had	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	took	her	to	a	 near 	 by 	 	 fist 	 ula 	 	hospital	in	addis	ababa	,	and	she	was	 repair 	 ed 	 	with	a	350	-	dollar	operation	.
the	 doctor 	 s 	 	and	 nurse 	 s 	 	there	 notice 	 d 	 	that	she	was	not	 on 	 ly 	 	a	 surviv 	 or 	 	,	she	was	 re 	 ally 	 	clever	,	and	they	made	her	a	nurse	.
so	now	,	mahabuba	,	she	is	saving	the	 live 	 s 	 	of	 hundred 	 s 	 	,	 thousand 	 s 	 	,	of	women	.
she	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	part	of	the	solution	,	not	the	problem	.
she	's	 move 	 d 	 	out	of	a	 vic 	 ious 	 	cycle	and	 in 	 to 	 	a	virtuous	cycle	.
i	've	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	some	of	the	 challeng 	 es 	 	,	let	me	talk	about	some	of	the	 solution 	 s 	 	,	and	there	are	 predict 	 able 	 	 solution 	 s 	 	.
i	've	 hint 	 ed 	 	at	them	:	education	and	 al 	 so 	 	economic	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
so	of	course	,	when	you	 educ 	 ate 	 	a	girl	,	she	 tend 	 s 	 	to	get	married	 lat 	 er 	 	on	in	life	,	she	 tend 	 s 	 	to	have	 kid 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	on	in	life	,	she	 tend 	 s 	 	to	have	 few 	 er 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	that	she	 do 	 es 	 	have	,	she	 educ 	 ates 	 	them	in	a	more	 enlighten 	 ed 	 	fashion	.
with	economic	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	,	it	can	be	 transform 	 ative 	 	.
let	me	tell	you	about	saima	.
she	 live 	 s 	 	in	a	small	village	 out 	 side 	 	lahore	,	pakistan	.
and	at	the	time	,	she	was	 mis 	 er 	 able 	 	.
she	was	 beat 	 en 	 	every	single	day	by	her	husband	,	who	was	 un 	 employ 	 ed 	 	.
he	was	kind	of	a	 gamble 	 r 	 	type	--	and	 un 	 employ 	 able 	 	,	 there 	 fore 	 	--	and	took	his	 frust 	 ration 	 s 	 	out	on	her	.
well	,	when	she	had	her	second	daughter	,	her	mother	in	-	law	told	her	son	,	``	i	think	you	'd	better	get	a	second	wife	.
saima	's	not	going	to	produce	you	a	son	.	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	when	she	had	her	second	daughter	.
at	the	time	,	there	was	a	 micro 	 lend 	 ing 	 	group	in	the	village	that	 g 	 ave 	 	her	a	65	-	dollar	loan	.
saima	took	that	money	,	and	she	 start 	 ed 	 	an	 embr 	 oid 	 ery 	 	business	.
the	 merchan 	 ts 	 	 like 	 d 	 	her	 embr 	 oid 	 ery 	 	;	it	 s 	 old 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	well	,	and	they	 ke 	 pt 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	for	more	.
and	when	she	could	n't	produce	 en 	 ough 	 	,	she	 hire 	 d 	 	other	women	in	the	village	.
 pre 	 tty 	 	soon	she	had	30	women	in	the	village	 work 	 ing 	 	for	her	 embr 	 oid 	 ery 	 	business	.
and	then	,	when	she	had	to	transport	all	of	the	 embr 	 oid 	 ery 	 	 good 	 s 	 	from	the	village	to	the	 market 	 place 	 	,	she	 need 	 ed 	 	 some 	 one 	 	to	help	her	do	the	transport	,	so	she	 hire 	 d 	 	her	husband	.
so	now	they	're	in	it	together	.

beatrice	was	living	in	uganda	near	the	congo	border	,	and	like	dai	manju	,	she	did	n't	go	to	school	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	she	had	never	 be 	 en 	 	to	school	,	not	to	a	lick	,	one	day	.
her	 parent 	 s 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	why	should	we	 s 	 pend 	 	the	money	on	her	?
she	's	going	to	 s 	 pend 	 	most	of	her	life	 lugg 	 ing 	 	water	back	and	forth	.	``	well	,	it	just	so	 happen 	 s 	 	,	at	that	time	,	there	was	a	group	in	connecticut	 call 	 ed 	 	the	niantic	community	church	group	in	connecticut	.
they	made	a	 don 	 ation 	 	to	an	 organ 	 ization 	 	based	in	arkansas	 call 	 ed 	 	heifer	 inter 	 national 	 	.
heifer	 s 	 ent 	 	two	 goat 	 s 	 	to	africa	.
one	of	them	 end 	 ed 	 	up	with	beatrice	's	 parent 	 s 	 	,
and	that	goat	had	 t 	 win 	 s 	 	.
the	 t 	 win 	 s 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	producing	milk	.
they	 s 	 old 	 	the	milk	for	cash	.

so	at	nine	 year 	 s 	 	of	age	,	beatrice	 start 	 ed 	 	in	first	grade	--	after	all	,	she	'd	never	 be 	 en 	 	to	a	lick	of	school	--	with	a	six	year	-	old	.
no	matter	,	she	was	just	 de 	 light 	 ed 	 	to	be	in	school	.
she	 rocket 	 ed 	 	to	the	top	of	her	class	.
she	 stay 	 ed 	 	at	the	top	of	her	class	through	 element 	 ary 	 	school	,	middle	school	,	and	then	in	high	school	,	she	 score 	 d 	 	 brilli 	 ant 	 ly 	 	on	the	national	 examination 	 s 	 	so	that	she	 be 	 came 	 	the	first	person	in	her	village	,	ever	,	to	come	to	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	on	 scholar 	 ship 	 	.

so	you	see	how	 transform 	 ative 	 	little	bits	of	help	can	be	.
but	i	want	to	give	you	a	 re 	 ality 	 	check	.
look	:	u.s.	aid	,	 help 	 ing 	 	people	is	not	easy	,
and	there	have	 be 	 en 	 	 book 	 s 	 	that	have	 critic 	 ized 	 	u.s.	aid	.
there	's	bill	easterly	's	book	.
there	's	a	book	 call 	 ed 	 	``	dead	aid	.	``
you	know	,	the	 critic 	 ism 	 	is	fair	;	it	is	n't	easy	.
you	know	,	people	say	how	half	of	all	water	well	 project 	 s 	 	,	a	year	 lat 	 er 	 	,	are	 fail 	 ed 	 	.
when	i	was	in	zimbabwe	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 tour 	 ing 	 	a	place	with	the	village	chief	--	he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	raise	money	for	a	 second 	 ary 	 	school	--	and	there	was	some	construction	a	few	 yard 	 s 	 	away	,	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	's	that	?	``
he	sort	of	 mum 	 bled 	 	.
 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	it	's	a	 fail 	 ed 	 	 irrig 	 ation 	 	project	.
a	few	 yard 	 s 	 	away	was	a	 fail 	 ed 	 	chicken	 co 	 op 	 	.
one	year	,	all	the	 chicken 	 s 	 	 di 	 ed 	 	,	and	no	one	 want 	 ed 	 	to	put	the	 chicken 	 s 	 	in	there	.
it	's	true	,	but	we	think	that	you	do	n't	through	the	baby	out	with	the	 bath 	 water 	 	;	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	improve	.
you	learn	from	your	 mistak 	 es 	 	,	and	you	 continu 	 ously 	 	improve	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	think	that	 individual 	 s 	 	can	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	,	and	they	should	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	,	together	,	we	can	all	help	create	a	 move 	 ment 	 	.
and	a	 move 	 ment 	 	of	men	and	women	is	what	's	 need 	 ed 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	about	social	change	,	change	that	will	address	 th 	 is 	 	great	moral	 challeng 	 e 	 	.
so	then	,	i	ask	,	what	's	in	it	for	you	?
you	're	 prob 	 ably 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	that	.	why	should	you	care	?
i	will	just	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	two	 thing 	 s 	 	.
one	is	that	research	 show 	 s 	 	that	once	you	have	all	of	your	material	 need 	 s 	 	taken	care	of	--	which	most	of	us	,	all	of	us	,	here	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	do	--	research	 show 	 s 	 	that	there	are	 ver 	 y 	 	few	 thing 	 s 	 	in	life	that	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	 elev 	 ate 	 	your	level	of	happiness	.
one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	is	 con 	 trib 	 uting 	 	to	a	cause	 large 	 r 	 	than	 your 	 self 	 	.
and	the	second	thing	,
it	's	an	anecdote	that	i	'll	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	.
and	that	is	the	story	of	an	aid	 work 	 er 	 	in	darfur	.
here	was	a	woman	who	had	 work 	 ed 	 	in	darfur	,	 see 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	no	human	 be 	 ing 	 	should	see	.
 through 	 out 	 	her	time	there	,	she	was	strong	,	she	was	 stead 	 fast 	 	.
she	never	broke	down	.
and	then	she	came	back	to	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	and	was	on	break	,	christmas	break	.
she	was	in	her	 grand 	 mother 	 	's	 back 	 yard 	 	,	and	she	saw	 some 	 thing 	 	that	made	her	break	down	in	 tear 	 s 	 	.
what	that	was	was	a	bird	 feed 	 er 	 	.
and	she	 real 	 ized 	 	that	she	had	the	great	fortune	to	be	born	in	a	country	where	we	take	security	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	,	where	we	not	 on 	 ly 	 	can	feed	,	clothe	and	house	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	provide	for	wild	 bird 	 s 	 	so	they	do	n't	go	 hung 	 ry 	 	in	the	winter	.
and	she	 real 	 ized 	 	that	with	that	great	fortune	 come 	 s 	 	great	 respons 	 ibility 	 	.
and	so	,	like	her	,	you	,	me	,	we	have	all	won	the	 lot 	 ter 	 y 	 	of	life	.
and	so	the	question	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	:	how	do	we	 dis 	 charge 	 	that	 respons 	 ibility 	 	?
so	,	here	's	the	cause	.
join	the	 move 	 ment 	 	.	feel	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	and	help	 s 	 ave 	 	the	world	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
