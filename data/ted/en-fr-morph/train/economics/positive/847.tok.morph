so	here	it	is	.	you	can	check	:	i	am	short	,	i	'm	french	,	i	have	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	strong	french	accent	,	so	that	's	going	to	be	clear	in	a	moment	.
 may 	 be 	 	a	 sober 	 ing 	 	thought	and	 some 	 thing 	 	you	all	know	about	.
and	i	suspect	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	 g 	 ave 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	to	the	people	of	 ha 	 iti 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	.
and	there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	else	i	 believ 	 e 	 	in	the	back	of	your	mind	you	 al 	 so 	 	know	.	that	is	,	every	day	,	25,000	children	die	of	 entire 	 ly 	 	 prevent 	 able 	 	 cause 	 s 	 	.
that	's	a	 ha 	 iti 	 	 earth 	 quake 	 	every	eight	 day 	 s 	 	.
and	i	suspect	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	that	problem	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	but	 some 	 how 	 	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	happen	with	the	same	 intens 	 ity 	 	.
so	why	is	that	?
well	,	here	is	a	thought	experiment	for	you	.
imagine	you	have	a	few	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	that	you	've	raised	--
 may 	 be 	 	you	're	a	 politic 	 ian 	 	in	a	 develop 	 ing 	 	country	and	you	have	a	budget	to	 s 	 pend 	 	.	you	want	to	 s 	 pend 	 	it	on	the	poor	:
how	do	you	go	about	it	?
do	you	 believ 	 e 	 	the	people	who	tell	you	that	all	we	need	to	do	is	to	 s 	 pend 	 	money	?	that	we	know	how	to	 eradic 	 ate 	 	poverty	,	we	just	need	to	do	more	?
or	do	you	 believ 	 e 	 	the	people	who	tell	you	that	aid	is	not	going	to	help	,	on	the	 contr 	 ary 	 	it	might	hurt	,	it	might	exacerbate	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	,	 depend 	 ence 	 	,	etc	.	?
or	 may 	 be 	 	you	turn	to	the	past	.
after	all	,	we	have	 s 	 pent 	 	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	on	aid	.
 may 	 be 	 	you	look	at	the	past	and	see	.	 ha 	 s 	 	it	 d 	 one 	 	any	good	?
and	,	 s 	 ad 	 ly 	 	,	we	do	n't	know	.
and	worst	of	all	,	we	will	never	know	.
and	the	reason	is	that	--	take	africa	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	.	africans	have	 al 	 ready 	 	got	a	lot	of	aid	.
these	are	the	blue	 bar 	 s 	 	.
and	the	gdp	in	africa	is	not	making	much	progress	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	fine	.	how	do	you	know	what	would	have	 happen 	 ed 	 	 with 	 out 	 	the	aid	?
 may 	 be 	 	it	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	much	 wo 	 rse 	 	,
or	 may 	 be 	 	it	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	better	.
we	have	no	idea	.	we	do	n't	know	what	the	 counter 	 factual 	 	is	.
there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	one	africa	.
so	what	do	you	do	?
to	give	the	aid	,	and	hope	and	pray	that	 some 	 thing 	 	 come 	 s 	 	out	of	it	?
or	do	you	focus	on	your	 every 	 day 	 	life	and	let	the	 earth 	 quake 	 	every	eight	 day 	 s 	 	 continu 	 e 	 	to	happen	?
the	thing	is	,	if	we	do	n't	know	 whet 	 her 	 	we	are	 do 	 ing 	 	any	good	,	we	are	not	any	better	than	the	 med 	 ieval 	 	 doctor 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 lee 	 ches 	 	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	the	patient	 get 	 s 	 	better	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	the	patient	dies	.
is	it	the	 lee 	 ches 	 	?	is	it	 some 	 thing 	 	else	?
we	do	n't	know	.
so	here	are	some	other	 question 	 s 	 	.
they	're	 small 	 er 	 	 question 	 s 	 	,	but	they	are	not	that	small	.
 immun 	 ization 	 	,	that	's	the	 cheap 	 est 	 	way	to	 s 	 ave 	 	a	child	's	life	.
and	the	world	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 pent 	 	a	lot	of	money	on	it	:
the	gavi	and	the	 gate 	 s 	 	 found 	 ations 	 	are	each	 pledg 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	money	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	it	,
and	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	effort	.
and	yet	,	every	year	at	 l 	 east 	 	25	million	children	do	not	get	the	 immun 	 ization 	 	they	should	get	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	you	call	a	``	last	mile	problem	.	``
the	technology	is	there	,
the	 infra 	 structure 	 	is	there	,
and	yet	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	happen	.
so	you	have	your	million	.	how	do	you	use	your	million	to	solve	 th 	 is 	 	last	mile	problem	?
and	here	's	 an 	 other 	 	question	:	malaria	.	malaria	 kill 	 s 	 	 al 	 most 	 	900,000	people	every	year	,	most	of	them	in	sub	-	saharan	africa	,	most	of	them	under	five	.
in	fact	,	that	is	the	 lead 	 ing 	 	cause	of	under	-	five	 mortal 	 ity 	 	.
we	 al 	 ready 	 	know	how	to	kill	malaria	,	but	some	people	come	to	you	and	say	,	``	you	have	your	 million 	 s 	 	.	how	about	bed	 net 	 s 	 	?	``
bed	 net 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	cheap	.
for	10	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	you	can	 manufactur 	 e 	 	and	ship	an	 insect 	 icide 	 	 treat 	 ed 	 	bed	net	and	you	can	teach	 some 	 one 	 	to	use	them	.
and	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	do	they	protect	the	people	who	sleep	under	them	,	but	they	have	these	great	 con 	 tag 	 ion 	 	 benefit 	 s 	 	.
if	half	of	a	community	 sleep 	 s 	 	under	a	net	,	the	other	half	 al 	 so 	 	 benefit 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 con 	 tag 	 ion 	 	of	the	disease	spread	.
and	yet	,	 on 	 ly 	 	a	quarter	of	 kid 	 s 	 	at	risk	sleep	under	a	net	.
 socie 	 ties 	 	should	be	 will 	 ing 	 	to	go	out	and	subsidize	the	net	,	give	them	for	free	,	or	,	for	that	matter	,	pay	people	to	use	them	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 con 	 tag 	 ion 	 	 benefit 	 s 	 	.
``	not	so	fast	,	``	say	other	people	.
``	if	you	give	the	 net 	 s 	 	for	free	,	people	are	not	going	to	value	them	.
they	're	not	going	to	use	them	,	or	at	 l 	 east 	 	they	're	not	going	to	use	them	 a 	 s 	 	bed	 net 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 fish 	 ing 	 	 net 	 s 	 	.	``
so	,	what	do	you	do	?
do	you	give	the	 net 	 s 	 	for	free	to	 maxim 	 ize 	 	 cover 	 age 	 	,
or	do	you	make	people	pay	in	order	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	they	 re 	 ally 	 	value	them	?
how	do	you	know	?
and	a	third	question	:	education	.
 may 	 be 	 	that	's	the	solution	,	 may 	 be 	 	we	should	 s 	 end 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	to	school	.
but	how	do	you	do	that	?
do	you	hire	 teacher 	 s 	 	?	do	you	build	more	 school 	 s 	 	?
do	you	provide	school	lunch	?
how	do	you	know	?
so	here	is	the	thing	.
i	can	not	answer	the	big	question	,	 whet 	 her 	 	aid	did	any	good	or	not	.	but	these	three	 question 	 s 	 	,	i	can	answer	them	.
it	's	not	the	middle	 age 	 s 	 	 any 	 more 	 	,
it	's	the	21st	century	.	and	in	the	20th	century	,	 random 	 ized 	 	,	controlled	 trial 	 s 	 	have	 revolution 	 ized 	 	medicine	by	 allow 	 ing 	 	us	to	distinguish	between	 drug 	 s 	 	that	work	and	 drug 	 s 	 	that	do	n't	work	.
and	you	can	do	the	same	 random 	 ized 	 	,	controlled	trial	for	social	policy	.
you	can	put	social	 innov 	 ation 	 	to	the	same	 rigor 	 ous 	 	,	scientific	 test 	 s 	 	that	we	use	for	 drug 	 s 	 	.
and	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	,	you	can	take	the	 guess 	 work 	 	out	of	policy	-	making	by	 know 	 ing 	 	what	 work 	 s 	 	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	and	why	.
and	i	'll	give	you	some	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	with	 t 	 hose 	 	three	 question 	 s 	 	.
so	i	start	with	 immun 	 ization 	 	.
here	's	udaipur	 di 	 strict 	 	,	rajasthan	.	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
well	,	when	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	there	,	about	one	percent	of	children	 we 	 re 	 	fully	 immun 	 ized 	 	.
that	's	bad	,	but	there	are	 place 	 s 	 	like	that	.
now	,	it	's	not	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 vaccin 	 es 	 	are	not	there	--
they	are	there	and	they	are	free	--
and	it	's	not	 be 	 cause 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	do	not	care	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	.
the	same	child	that	is	not	 immun 	 ized 	 	against	 mea 	 s 	 les 	 	,	if	they	do	get	 mea 	 s 	 les 	 	,	 parent 	 s 	 	will	 s 	 pend 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 rupee 	 s 	 	to	help	them	.
so	you	get	these	empty	village	 sub 	 center 	 s 	 	and	 crowd 	 ed 	 	 hospital 	 s 	 	.
so	what	is	the	problem	?
well	,	part	of	the	problem	,	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	,	is	people	do	not	fully	understand	.
after	all	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 myth 	 s 	 	and	 mis 	 conception 	 s 	 	go	around	 immun 	 ization 	 	.
so	if	that	's	the	case	,	that	's	difficult	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 persuas 	 ion 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	difficult	.
but	 may 	 be 	 	there	is	 an 	 other 	 	problem	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
it	's	going	from	 intent 	 ion 	 	to	action	.
imagine	you	are	a	mother	in	udaipur	 di 	 strict 	 	,	rajasthan	.
you	have	to	walk	a	few	 kilometer 	 s 	 	to	get	your	 kid 	 s 	 	 immun 	 ized 	 	.
and	 may 	 be 	 	when	you	get	there	,	what	you	find	is	 th 	 is 	 	:
the	 sub 	 center 	 	is	closed	.	ao	you	have	to	come	back	,
and	you	are	so	 bus 	 y 	 	and	you	have	so	 man 	 y 	 	other	 thing 	 s 	 	to	do	,	you	will	 al 	 ways 	 	tend	to	postpone	and	postpone	,	and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	it	 get 	 s 	 	too	late	.
well	,	if	that	's	the	problem	,	then	that	's	much	 eas 	 ier 	 	.	 be 	 cause 	 	a	,	we	can	make	it	easy	,	and	b	,	we	can	 may 	 be 	 	give	people	a	reason	to	act	 to 	 day 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	wait	till	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	.
so	these	are	simple	 idea 	 s 	 	,	but	we	did	n't	know	.
so	let	's	try	them	.
so	what	we	did	is	we	did	a	 random 	 ized 	 	,	controlled	trial	in	134	 village 	 s 	 	in	udaipur	 di 	 strict 	 s 	 	.
so	the	blue	 dot 	 s 	 	are	 select 	 ed 	 	 random 	 ly 	 	.
we	made	it	easy	--	i	'll	tell	you	how	in	a	moment	.
in	the	red	 dot 	 s 	 	,	we	made	it	easy	and	 g 	 ave 	 	people	a	reason	to	act	now	.
the	white	 dot 	 s 	 	are	 compar 	 ison 	 s 	 	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	 change 	 d 	 	.
so	we	make	it	easy	by	 organ 	 izing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 month 	 ly 	 	camp	where	people	can	get	 the 	 ir 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	 immun 	 ized 	 	.
and	then	you	make	it	easy	and	give	a	reason	to	act	now	by	 add 	 ing 	 	a	kilo	of	 lent 	 il 	 s 	 	for	each	 immun 	 ization 	 	.
now	,	a	kilo	of	 lent 	 il 	 s 	 	is	 tin 	 y 	 	.
it	's	never	going	to	 con 	 vince 	 	 any 	 body 	 	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	that	they	do	n't	want	to	do	.
on	the	other	hand	,	if	your	problem	is	you	tend	to	postpone	,	then	it	might	give	you	a	reason	to	act	 to 	 day 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 lat 	 er 	 	.
so	what	do	we	find	?
well	,	 before 	 hand 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	is	the	same	.
that	's	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	of	 random 	 ization 	 	.
 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	the	camp	--	just	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	camp	--	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	 immun 	 ization 	 	from	six	percent	to	17	percent	.
that	's	full	 immun 	 ization 	 	.
that	's	not	bad	,	that	's	a	good	 improve 	 ment 	 	.
add	the	 lent 	 il 	 s 	 	and	you	reach	to	38	percent	.
so	here	you	've	got	your	answer	.
make	it	easy	and	give	a	kilo	of	 lent 	 il 	 s 	 	,	you	 multi 	 ply 	 	 immun 	 ization 	 	rate	by	six	.
now	,	you	might	say	,	``	well	,	but	it	's	not	 sustain 	 able 	 	.
we	can	not	keep	giving	 lent 	 il 	 s 	 	to	people	.	``
well	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	it	's	wrong	 economic 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	 cheap 	 er 	 	to	give	 lent 	 il 	 s 	 	than	not	to	give	them	.
since	you	have	to	pay	for	the	nurse	 any 	 way 	 	,	the	cost	per	 immun 	 ization 	 	 end 	 s 	 	up	 be 	 ing 	 	 cheap 	 er 	 	if	you	give	 incentive 	 s 	 	than	if	you	do	n't	.
how	about	bed	 net 	 s 	 	?
should	you	give	them	for	free	,	or	should	you	ask	people	to	pay	for	them	?
so	the	answer	 h 	 ing 	 es 	 	on	the	answer	to	three	simple	 question 	 s 	 	.
one	is	:	if	people	must	pay	for	a	bed	net	,	are	they	going	to	purchase	them	?
the	second	one	is	:	if	i	give	bed	 net 	 s 	 	for	free	,	are	people	going	to	use	them	?
and	the	third	one	is	:	do	free	bed	 net 	 s 	 	 dis 	 courage 	 	future	purchase	?
the	third	one	is	 import 	 ant 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	if	we	think	people	get	used	to	 hand 	 out 	 s 	 	,	it	might	destroy	 market 	 s 	 	to	 distribut 	 e 	 	free	bed	 net 	 s 	 	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	debate	that	 ha 	 s 	 	generated	a	lot	of	emotion	and	 ang 	 ry 	 	rhetoric	.
it	's	more	 ideo 	 logical 	 	than	practical	,	but	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	it	's	an	easy	question	.
we	can	know	the	answer	to	 th 	 is 	 	question	.
we	can	just	run	an	experiment	.	and	 man 	 y 	 	 experiment 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	run	,	and	they	all	have	the	same	 result 	 s 	 	,
so	i	'm	just	going	to	talk	to	you	about	one	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	one	that	was	in	kenya	,	they	went	around	and	 distribut 	 ed 	 	to	people	 voucher 	 s 	 	,	 dis 	 count 	 	 voucher 	 s 	 	.
so	people	with	 the 	 ir 	 	voucher	could	get	the	bed	net	in	the	local	 pharma 	 cy 	 	.
and	some	people	get	100	percent	 dis 	 count 	 	,	and	some	people	get	20	percent	 dis 	 count 	 s 	 	,	and	some	people	get	50	percent	 dis 	 count 	 	,	etc	.
and	now	we	can	see	what	 happen 	 s 	 	.
so	,	how	about	the	 pur 	 chasing 	 	?
well	,	what	you	can	see	is	that	when	people	have	to	pay	for	 the 	 ir 	 	bed	 net 	 s 	 	,	the	 cover 	 age 	 	rate	 re 	 ally 	 	 fall 	 s 	 	down	a	lot	.
so	even	with	partial	 sub 	 s 	 idy 	 	,	three	 dollar 	 s 	 	is	still	not	the	full	cost	of	a	bed	net	,	and	now	you	 on 	 ly 	 	have	20	percent	of	the	people	with	the	bed	 net 	 s 	 	,	you	lose	the	health	 immun 	 ity 	 	,	that	's	not	great	.
second	thing	is	,	how	about	the	use	?
well	,	the	good	news	is	,	people	,	if	they	have	the	bed	 net 	 s 	 	,	will	use	the	bed	 net 	 s 	 	 regard 	 less 	 	of	how	they	got	it	.
if	they	get	it	for	free	,	they	use	it	.
if	they	have	to	pay	for	it	,	they	use	it	.
how	about	the	long	term	?
in	the	long	term	,	people	who	got	the	free	bed	 net 	 s 	 	,	one	year	 lat 	 er 	 	,	 we 	 re 	 	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	the	option	to	purchase	a	bed	net	at	two	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
and	people	who	got	the	free	one	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	purchase	the	second	one	than	people	who	did	n't	get	a	free	one	.
so	people	do	not	get	used	to	 hand 	 out 	 s 	 	;	they	get	used	to	 net 	 s 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	we	need	to	give	them	a	little	bit	more	credit	.
so	,	that	's	for	bed	 net 	 s 	 	.	so	you	will	think	,	``	that	's	great	.
you	know	how	to	 immun 	 ize 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	,	you	know	how	to	give	bed	 net 	 s 	 	.	``
but	what	 politic 	 ians 	 	need	is	a	range	of	 option 	 s 	 	.
they	need	to	know	:	out	of	all	the	 thing 	 s 	 	i	could	do	,	what	is	the	best	way	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	my	 goal 	 s 	 	?
so	suppose	your	goal	is	to	get	 kid 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	school	.
there	are	so	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	you	could	do	.	you	could	pay	for	 uniform 	 s 	 	,	you	could	eliminate	 fee 	 s 	 	,	you	could	build	 latrine 	 s 	 	,	you	could	give	 girl 	 s 	 	 sanit 	 ary 	 	 pad 	 s 	 	,	etc	.	,	etc	.
so	what	's	the	best	?
well	,	at	some	level	,	we	think	all	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	should	work	.
so	,	is	that	sufficient	?	if	we	think	they	should	work	 intuitive 	 ly 	 	,	should	we	go	for	them	?
well	,	in	business	,	that	's	 certain 	 ly 	 	not	the	way	we	would	go	about	it	.
consider	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	 transport 	 ing 	 	 good 	 s 	 	.
before	the	 can 	 al 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 invent 	 ed 	 	in	britain	before	the	industrial	revolution	,	 good 	 s 	 	used	to	go	on	horse	 cart 	 s 	 	.
and	then	 can 	 al 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	built	,	and	with	the	same	 horse 	 man 	 	and	the	same	horse	,	you	could	carry	ten	 time 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	 car 	 go 	 	.
so	should	they	have	 continu 	 ed 	 	to	carry	the	 good 	 s 	 	on	the	horse	 cart 	 s 	 	,	on	the	ground	,	that	they	would	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	get	there	?
well	,	if	that	had	 be 	 en 	 	the	case	,	there	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	no	industrial	revolution	.
so	why	should	n't	we	do	the	same	with	social	policy	?
in	technology	,	we	 s 	 pend 	 	so	much	time	 experiment 	 ing 	 	,	fine	-	 t 	 un 	 ing 	 	,	 get 	 ting 	 	the	absolute	 cheap 	 est 	 	way	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	,	so	why	are	n't	we	 do 	 ing 	 	that	with	social	policy	?
well	,	with	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	what	you	can	do	is	answer	a	simple	question	.
suppose	you	have	100	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	 s 	 pend 	 	on	 vari 	 ous 	 	 intervention 	 s 	 	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	extra	 year 	 s 	 	of	education	do	you	get	for	your	hundred	 dollar 	 s 	 	?
now	i	'm	going	to	show	you	what	we	get	with	 vari 	 ous 	 	education	 intervention 	 s 	 	.
so	the	first	 one 	 s 	 	are	if	you	want	the	usual	 suspect 	 s 	 	,	hire	 teacher 	 s 	 	,	school	 meal 	 s 	 	,	school	 uniform 	 s 	 	,	 scholar 	 ship 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	not	bad	.	for	your	hundred	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	you	get	between	one	and	three	extra	 year 	 s 	 	of	education	.
 thing 	 s 	 	that	do	n't	work	so	well	is	 b 	 rib 	 ing 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	,	just	 be 	 cause 	 	so	 man 	 y 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 ready 	 	going	to	school	that	you	end	up	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	money	.
and	here	are	the	most	surprising	 result 	 s 	 	.
tell	people	the	 benefit 	 s 	 	of	education	,
that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	cheap	to	do	.
so	for	every	hundred	 dollar 	 s 	 	you	 s 	 pend 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	that	,	you	get	40	extra	 year 	 s 	 	of	education	.
and	,	in	 place 	 s 	 	where	there	are	 worm 	 s 	 	,	intestinal	 worm 	 s 	 	,	cure	the	 kid 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 worm 	 s 	 	.
and	for	every	hundred	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	you	get	 al 	 most 	 	30	extra	 year 	 s 	 	of	education	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	your	 intuit 	 ion 	 	,
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	what	people	would	have	gone	for	,	and	yet	,	these	are	the	 program 	 s 	 	that	work	.
we	need	that	kind	of	information	,	we	need	more	of	it	,
and	then	we	need	to	guide	policy	.
so	now	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	from	the	big	problem	,	and	i	could	n't	answer	it	.
and	i	cut	it	 in 	 to 	 	 small 	 er 	 	 question 	 s 	 	,	and	i	have	the	answer	to	these	 small 	 er 	 	 question 	 s 	 	.
and	they	are	good	,	scientific	,	 ro 	 bust 	 	 answer 	 s 	 	.
so	let	's	go	back	to	 ha 	 iti 	 	for	a	moment	.
in	 ha 	 iti 	 	,	about	200,000	people	 di 	 ed 	 	--
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	a	bit	more	by	the	 lat 	 est 	 	estimate	.
and	the	 respons 	 e 	 	of	the	world	was	great	:
two	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	got	 pledg 	 ed 	 	just	last	month	,
so	that	's	about	10,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	per	death	.
that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	sound	like	that	much	when	you	think	about	it	.	but	if	we	 we 	 re 	 	 will 	 ing 	 	to	 s 	 pend 	 	10,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	for	every	child	under	five	who	dies	,	that	would	be	90	billion	per	year	just	for	that	problem	.
and	yet	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	happen	.
so	,	why	is	that	?
well	,	i	think	what	part	of	the	problem	is	that	,	in	 ha 	 iti 	 	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	the	problem	is	huge	,	 some 	 how 	 	we	understand	it	,	it	's	 local 	 ized 	 	.
you	give	your	money	to	 doctor 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 border 	 s 	 	,	you	give	your	money	to	 partner 	 s 	 	in	health	,	and	they	'll	 s 	 end 	 	in	the	 doctor 	 s 	 	,	and	they	'll	 s 	 end 	 	in	the	lumber	,	and	they	'll	helicopter	 thing 	 s 	 	out	and	in	.
and	the	problem	of	poverty	is	not	like	that	.
so	,	first	,	it	's	 most 	 ly 	 	 in 	 visible 	 	;
second	,	it	's	huge	;
and	third	,	we	do	n't	know	 whet 	 her 	 	we	are	 do 	 ing 	 	the	right	thing	.
there	's	no	silver	bullet	.
you	can	not	helicopter	people	out	of	poverty	.
and	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 frust 	 rating 	 	.
but	look	what	we	just	did	 to 	 day 	 	.
i	 g 	 ave 	 	you	three	simple	 answer 	 s 	 	to	three	 question 	 s 	 	:
give	 lent 	 il 	 s 	 	to	 immun 	 ize 	 	people	,	provide	free	bed	 net 	 s 	 	,	 de 	 worm 	 	children	.
with	 immun 	 ization 	 	or	bed	 net 	 s 	 	,	you	can	 s 	 ave 	 	a	life	for	300	 dollar 	 s 	 	per	life	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	.
with	 de 	 worm 	 ing 	 	,	you	can	get	an	extra	year	of	education	for	three	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
so	we	can	not	 eradic 	 ate 	 	poverty	just	yet	,	but	we	can	get	 start 	 ed 	 	.
and	 may 	 be 	 	we	can	get	 start 	 ed 	 	small	with	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	know	are	effective	.
here	's	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	how	 th 	 is 	 	can	be	 power 	 ful 	 	.
 de 	 worm 	 ing 	 	.
 worm 	 s 	 	have	a	little	bit	of	a	problem	 grab 	 bing 	 	the	 head 	 lines 	 	.
they	are	not	 beaut 	 iful 	 	and	do	n't	kill	 any 	 body 	 	.
and	yet	,	when	the	young	global	 lead 	 er 	 	in	davos	 show 	 ed 	 	the	 number 	 s 	 	i	 g 	 ave 	 	you	,	they	 start 	 ed 	 	 de 	 worm 	 	the	world	.
and	 thank 	 s 	 	to	 de 	 worm 	 	the	world	,	and	the	effort	of	 man 	 y 	 	country	 government 	 s 	 	and	 found 	 ations 	 	,	20	million	school	-	aged	children	got	 de 	 worm 	 ed 	 	in	2009	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	evidence	is	 power 	 ful 	 	.
it	can	prompt	action	.
so	we	should	get	 start 	 ed 	 	now	.
it	's	not	going	to	be	easy	.
it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 low 	 	process	.
you	have	to	keep	 experiment 	 ing 	 	,	and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 ideo 	 logy 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 trump 	 ed 	 	by	 practical 	 ity 	 	.
and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	what	 work 	 s 	 	 some 	 where 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	 else 	 where 	 	.
so	it	's	a	 s 	 low 	 	process	,	but	there	is	no	other	way	.
these	 economic 	 s 	 	i	'm	 pro 	 posing 	 	,	it	's	like	20th	century	medicine	.
it	's	a	 s 	 low 	 	,	 de 	 liber 	 ative 	 	process	of	 discover 	 y 	 	.
there	is	no	miracle	cure	,	but	modern	medicine	is	saving	 million 	 s 	 	of	 live 	 s 	 	every	year	,	and	we	can	do	the	same	thing	.
and	now	,	 may 	 be 	 	,	we	can	go	back	to	the	 big 	 ger 	 	question	that	i	 start 	 ed 	 	with	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
i	can	not	tell	you	 whet 	 her 	 	the	aid	we	have	 s 	 pent 	 	in	the	past	 ha 	 s 	 	made	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	,	but	can	we	come	back	here	in	30	 year 	 s 	 	and	say	,	``	what	we	have	 d 	 one 	 	,	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 prompt 	 ed 	 	a	change	for	the	better	.	``
i	 believ 	 e 	 	we	can	and	i	hope	we	will	.
thank	you	.
