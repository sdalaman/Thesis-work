i	want	to	talk	to	you	 to 	 day 	 	a	little	bit	about	 predict 	 able 	 	 irrational 	 ity 	 	.
and	my	interest	in	irrational	behavior	 start 	 ed 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	ago	in	the	hospital	.
i	was	 burn 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 bad 	 ly 	 	.	and	if	you	 s 	 pend 	 	a	lot	of	time	in	hospital	,	you	'll	see	a	lot	of	 type 	 s 	 	of	 irrational 	 ities 	 	.
and	the	one	that	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 both 	 er 	 ed 	 	me	in	the	burn	 depart 	 ment 	 	was	the	process	by	which	the	 nurse 	 s 	 	took	the	 band 	 age 	 	off	me	.
now	,	you	must	have	all	taken	a	band	-	aid	off	at	some	point	,	and	you	must	have	 wonder 	 ed 	 	what	's	the	right	approach	.
do	you	rip	it	off	 quick 	 ly 	 	--	short	 dur 	 ation 	 	but	high	 intens 	 ity 	 	--	or	do	you	take	your	band	-	aid	off	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	--	you	take	a	long	time	,	but	each	second	is	not	 a 	 s 	 	 pain 	 ful 	 	--	which	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	is	the	right	approach	?
the	 nurse 	 s 	 	in	my	 depart 	 ment 	 	thought	that	the	right	approach	was	the	 rip 	 ping 	 	one	,	so	they	would	grab	hold	and	they	would	rip	,	and	they	would	grab	hold	and	they	would	rip	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	i	had	70	percent	of	my	body	 burn 	 ed 	 	,	it	would	take	about	an	hour	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	imagine	,	i	 hat 	 ed 	 	that	moment	of	 rip 	 ping 	 	with	 in 	 credible 	 	 intens 	 ity 	 	.
and	i	would	try	to	reason	with	them	and	say	,	``	why	do	n't	we	try	 some 	 thing 	 	else	?
why	do	n't	we	take	it	a	little	 long 	 er 	 	--	 may 	 be 	 	two	 hour 	 s 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	an	hour	--	and	have	less	of	 th 	 is 	 	 intens 	 ity 	 	?	``
and	the	 nurse 	 s 	 	told	me	two	 thing 	 s 	 	.
they	told	me	that	they	had	the	right	model	of	the	patient	--	that	they	 k 	 new 	 	what	was	the	right	thing	to	do	to	 minim 	 ize 	 	my	pain	--	and	they	 al 	 so 	 	told	me	that	the	word	patient	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	to	make	 suggest 	 ions 	 	or	to	interfere	or	...
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	just	in	hebrew	,	by	the	way	.	it	's	in	every	language	i	've	had	experience	with	so	far	.
and	,	you	know	,	there	's	not	much	--	there	was	n't	much	i	could	do	,	and	they	 ke 	 pt 	 	on	 do 	 ing 	 	what	they	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	.
and	about	three	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	when	i	left	the	hospital	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	at	the	university	.
and	one	of	the	most	 interest 	 ing 	 	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	was	that	there	is	an	 experiment 	 al 	 	method	that	if	you	have	a	question	you	can	create	a	replica	of	 th 	 is 	 	question	in	some	abstract	way	,	and	you	can	try	to	examine	 th 	 is 	 	question	,	 may 	 be 	 	learn	 some 	 thing 	 	about	the	world	.
so	that	's	what	i	did	.
i	was	still	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	question	of	how	do	you	take	 band 	 age 	 s 	 	off	burn	 patient 	 s 	 	.
so	 original 	 ly 	 	i	did	n't	have	much	money	,	so	i	went	to	a	 hard 	 ware 	 	store	and	i	 b 	 ought 	 	a	 carp 	 enter 	 	's	vice	.
and	i	would	 br 	 ing 	 	people	to	the	lab	and	i	would	put	 the 	 ir 	 	finger	in	it	,	and	i	would	crunch	it	a	little	bit	.
and	i	would	crunch	it	for	long	 period 	 s 	 	and	short	 period 	 s 	 	,	and	pain	that	went	up	and	pain	that	went	down	,	and	with	 break 	 s 	 	and	 with 	 out 	 	 break 	 s 	 	--	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 version 	 s 	 	of	pain	.
and	when	i	 finish 	 ed 	 	 hurt 	 ing 	 	people	a	little	bit	,	i	would	ask	them	,	so	,	how	 pain 	 ful 	 	was	 th 	 is 	 	?	or	,	how	 pain 	 ful 	 	was	 th 	 is 	 	?
or	,	if	you	had	to	 choos 	 e 	 	between	the	last	two	,	which	one	would	you	 choos 	 e 	 	?
i	 ke 	 pt 	 	on	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	for	a	while	.
and	then	,	like	all	good	academic	 project 	 s 	 	,	i	got	more	 fund 	 ing 	 	.
i	 move 	 d 	 	to	 sound 	 s 	 	,	 electric 	 al 	 	 shock 	 s 	 	--	i	even	had	a	pain	suit	that	i	could	get	people	to	feel	much	more	pain	.
but	at	the	end	of	 th 	 is 	 	process	,	what	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	was	that	the	 nurse 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	wrong	.
here	 we 	 re 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	people	with	good	 intent 	 ions 	 	and	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	experience	,	and	 never 	 the 	 less 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	wrong	 predict 	 ably 	 	all	the	time	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	 be 	 cause 	 	we	do	n't	encode	 dur 	 ation 	 	in	the	way	that	we	encode	 intens 	 ity 	 	,	i	would	have	had	less	pain	if	the	 dur 	 ation 	 	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	 long 	 er 	 	and	the	 intens 	 ity 	 	was	lower	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	it	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	better	to	start	with	my	face	,	which	was	much	more	 pain 	 ful 	 	,	and	move	 to 	 ward 	 	my	 leg 	 s 	 	,	giving	me	a	trend	of	 improve 	 ment 	 	over	time	--	that	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	 al 	 so 	 	less	 pain 	 ful 	 	.
and	it	 al 	 so 	 	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	it	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	good	to	give	me	 break 	 s 	 	in	the	middle	to	kind	of	 recupe 	 rate 	 	from	the	pain	.
all	of	these	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	great	 thing 	 s 	 	to	do	,	and	my	 nurse 	 s 	 	had	no	idea	.
and	from	that	point	on	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	,	are	the	 nurse 	 s 	 	the	 on 	 ly 	 	people	in	the	world	who	get	 thing 	 s 	 	wrong	in	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	decision	,	or	is	it	a	more	general	case	?
and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	it	's	a	more	general	case	--	there	's	a	lot	of	 mistak 	 es 	 	we	do	.
and	i	want	to	give	you	one	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	one	of	these	 irrational 	 ities 	 	,	and	i	want	to	talk	to	you	about	 cheat 	 ing 	 	.
and	the	reason	i	 pick 	 ed 	 	 cheat 	 ing 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	it	 tell 	 s 	 	us	 some 	 thing 	 	,	i	think	,	about	the	stock	market	 situ 	 ation 	 	we	're	in	.
so	,	my	interest	in	 cheat 	 ing 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	when	enron	came	on	the	scene	,	 explode 	 d 	 	all	of	a	sudden	,	and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	what	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	here	.
is	it	the	case	that	there	was	kind	of	a	few	 apple 	 s 	 	who	are	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 do 	 ing 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	or	are	we	 talk 	 ing 	 	a	more	 en 	 demic 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	that	 man 	 y 	 	people	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 behav 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	way	?
so	,	like	we	 usual 	 ly 	 	do	,	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	do	a	simple	experiment	.
and	here	's	how	it	went	.
if	you	 we 	 re 	 	in	the	experiment	,	i	would	pass	you	a	sheet	of	paper	with	20	simple	math	 problem 	 s 	 	that	 every 	 body 	 	could	solve	,	but	i	would	n't	give	you	 en 	 ough 	 	time	.
when	the	five	 minute 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	over	,	i	would	say	,	``	pass	me	the	 sheet 	 s 	 	of	paper	,	and	i	'll	pay	you	a	dollar	per	question	.	``
people	did	 th 	 is 	 	.	i	would	pay	people	four	 dollar 	 s 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	task	--	on	average	people	would	solve	four	 problem 	 s 	 	.
other	people	i	would	tempt	to	cheat	.
i	would	pass	 the 	 ir 	 	sheet	of	paper	.
when	the	five	 minute 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	over	,	i	would	say	,	``	 pleas 	 e 	 	shred	the	piece	of	paper	.
put	the	little	 piece 	 s 	 	in	your	pocket	or	in	your	 back 	 pack 	 	,	and	tell	me	how	 man 	 y 	 	 question 	 s 	 	you	got	 correct 	 ly 	 	.	``
people	now	 solve 	 d 	 	seven	 question 	 s 	 	on	average	.
now	,	it	was	n't	 a 	 s 	 	if	there	was	a	few	bad	 apple 	 s 	 	--	a	few	people	 cheat 	 ed 	 	a	lot	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	what	we	saw	is	a	lot	of	people	who	cheat	a	little	bit	.
now	,	in	economic	 theor 	 y 	 	,	 cheat 	 ing 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	cost	-	benefit	analysis	.
you	say	,	what	's	the	 prob 	 ability 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	caught	?
how	much	do	i	stand	to	gain	from	 cheat 	 ing 	 	?
and	how	much	 punish 	 ment 	 	would	i	get	if	i	get	caught	?
and	you	weigh	these	 option 	 s 	 	out	--	you	do	the	simple	cost	-	benefit	analysis	,	and	you	decide	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	 worth 	 while 	 	to	commit	the	crime	or	not	.
so	,	we	try	to	test	 th 	 is 	 	.
for	some	people	,	we	 vari 	 ed 	 	how	much	money	they	could	get	away	with	--	how	much	money	they	could	steal	.
we	paid	them	10	 cent 	 s 	 	per	correct	question	,	50	 cent 	 s 	 	,	a	dollar	,	five	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	10	 dollar 	 s 	 	per	correct	question	.
you	would	expect	that	 a 	 s 	 	the	amount	of	money	on	the	table	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	,	people	would	cheat	more	,	but	in	fact	it	was	n't	the	case	.
we	got	a	lot	of	people	 cheat 	 ing 	 	by	 steal 	 ing 	 	by	a	little	bit	.
what	about	the	 prob 	 ability 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	caught	?
some	people	 shred 	 d 	 ed 	 	half	the	sheet	of	paper	,	so	there	was	some	evidence	left	.
some	people	 shred 	 d 	 ed 	 	the	whole	sheet	of	paper	.
some	people	 shred 	 d 	 ed 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	,	went	out	of	the	room	,	and	paid	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	from	the	bowl	of	money	that	had	over	100	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
you	would	expect	that	 a 	 s 	 	the	 prob 	 ability 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	caught	 go 	 es 	 	down	,	people	would	cheat	more	,	but	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	not	the	case	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	a	lot	of	people	 cheat 	 ed 	 	by	just	by	a	little	bit	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 in 	 sensitive 	 	to	these	economic	 incentive 	 s 	 	.
so	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	if	people	are	not	sensitive	to	the	economic	rational	 theor 	 y 	 	 explan 	 ations 	 	,	to	these	 force 	 s 	 	,	what	could	be	going	on	?	``
and	we	thought	 may 	 be 	 	what	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	is	that	there	are	two	 force 	 s 	 	.
at	one	hand	,	we	all	want	to	look	at	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	the	mirror	and	feel	good	about	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	so	we	do	n't	want	to	cheat	.
on	the	other	hand	,	we	can	cheat	a	little	bit	,	and	still	feel	good	about	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
so	,	 may 	 be 	 	what	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	is	that	there	's	a	level	of	 cheat 	 ing 	 	we	ca	n't	go	over	,	but	we	can	still	benefit	from	 cheat 	 ing 	 	at	a	low	degree	,	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	change	our	 impression 	 s 	 	about	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
we	call	 th 	 is 	 	like	a	personal	fudge	factor	.
now	,	how	would	you	test	a	personal	fudge	factor	?
 initi 	 ally 	 	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	what	can	we	do	to	shrink	the	fudge	factor	?
so	,	we	got	people	to	the	lab	,	and	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	have	two	 task 	 s 	 	for	you	 to 	 day 	 	.	``
first	,	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	half	the	people	to	recall	either	10	 book 	 s 	 	they	read	in	high	school	,	or	to	recall	the	ten	 command 	 ments 	 	,	and	then	we	 tempt 	 ed 	 	them	with	 cheat 	 ing 	 	.
 turn 	 s 	 	out	the	people	who	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	recall	the	ten	 command 	 ments 	 	--	and	in	our	 s 	 ample 	 	 no 	 body 	 	could	recall	all	of	the	ten	 command 	 ments 	 	--	but	 t 	 hose 	 	people	who	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	recall	the	ten	 command 	 ments 	 	,	 give 	 n 	 	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	cheat	,	did	not	cheat	at	all	.
it	was	n't	that	the	more	religious	people	--	the	people	who	 remember 	 ed 	 	more	of	the	 command 	 ments 	 	--	 cheat 	 ed 	 	less	,	and	the	less	religious	people	--
the	people	who	could	n't	remember	 al 	 most 	 	any	 command 	 ments 	 	--
 cheat 	 ed 	 	more	.
the	moment	people	thought	about	 try 	 ing 	 	to	recall	the	ten	 command 	 ments 	 	,	they	 stop 	 ped 	 	 cheat 	 ing 	 	.
in	fact	,	even	when	we	 g 	 ave 	 	self	-	 declare 	 d 	 	 atheist 	 s 	 	the	task	of	 s 	 wear 	 ing 	 	on	the	 b 	 ible 	 	and	we	give	them	a	chance	to	cheat	,	they	do	n't	cheat	at	all	.
now	,	ten	 command 	 ments 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	hard	to	 br 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	education	system	,	so	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	why	do	n't	we	get	people	to	sign	the	honor	code	?	``
so	,	we	got	people	to	sign	,	``	i	understand	that	 th 	 is 	 	short	survey	 fall 	 s 	 	under	the	mit	honor	code	.	``
then	they	 shred 	 d 	 ed 	 	it	.	no	 cheat 	 ing 	 	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	mit	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	an	honor	code	.
so	,	all	 th 	 is 	 	was	about	 decr 	 eas 	 ing 	 	the	fudge	factor	.
what	about	increasing	the	fudge	factor	?
the	first	experiment	--	i	 walk 	 ed 	 	around	mit	and	i	 distribut 	 ed 	 	six	-	 pack 	 s 	 	of	cokes	in	the	 refrige 	 rator 	 s 	 	--	these	 we 	 re 	 	common	 refrige 	 rator 	 s 	 	for	the	 under 	 grad 	 s 	 	.
and	i	came	back	to	measure	what	we	 technical 	 ly 	 	call	the	half	-	 life 	 time 	 	of	 co 	 ke 	 	--	how	long	 do 	 es 	 	it	last	in	the	 refrige 	 rator 	 s 	 	?
 a 	 s 	 	you	can	expect	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	last	 ver 	 y 	 	long	;	people	take	it	.
in	contrast	,	i	took	a	plate	with	six	one	-	dollar	 bill 	 s 	 	,	and	i	left	 t 	 hose 	 	 plate 	 s 	 	in	the	same	 refrige 	 rator 	 s 	 	.
no	bill	ever	 disappear 	 ed 	 	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	good	social	science	experiment	,	so	to	do	it	better	i	did	the	same	experiment	 a 	 s 	 	i	 de 	 scribed 	 	to	you	before	.
a	third	of	the	people	we	 pass 	 ed 	 	the	sheet	,	they	 g 	 ave 	 	it	back	to	us	.
a	third	of	the	people	we	 pass 	 ed 	 	it	to	,	they	 shred 	 d 	 ed 	 	it	,	they	came	to	us	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	mr.	 experiment 	 er 	 	,	i	 solve 	 d 	 	x	 problem 	 s 	 	.	give	me	x	 dollar 	 s 	 	.	``
a	third	of	the	people	,	when	they	 finish 	 ed 	 	 shred 	 d 	 ing 	 	the	piece	of	paper	,	they	came	to	us	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	mr	 experiment 	 er 	 	,	i	 solve 	 d 	 	x	 problem 	 s 	 	.	give	me	x	 to 	 ken 	 s 	 	.	``
we	did	not	pay	them	with	 dollar 	 s 	 	;	we	paid	them	with	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
and	then	they	took	the	 some 	 thing 	 	else	,	they	 walk 	 ed 	 	12	feet	to	the	side	,	and	 ex 	 change 	 d 	 	it	for	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
think	about	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	 intuit 	 ion 	 	.
how	bad	would	you	feel	about	taking	a	pencil	from	work	home	,	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	how	bad	would	you	feel	about	taking	10	 cent 	 s 	 	from	a	 pet 	 ty 	 	cash	box	?
these	 thing 	 s 	 	feel	 ver 	 y 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	.
would	 be 	 ing 	 	a	step	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	from	cash	for	a	few	 second 	 s 	 	by	 be 	 ing 	 	paid	by	 to 	 ken 	 	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	?
our	 subject 	 s 	 	 double 	 d 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 cheat 	 ing 	 	.
i	'll	tell	you	what	i	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	and	the	stock	market	in	a	minute	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	did	not	solve	the	big	problem	i	had	with	enron	yet	,	 be 	 cause 	 	in	enron	,	there	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	social	element	.
people	see	each	other	 behav 	 ing 	 	.
in	fact	,	every	day	when	we	open	the	news	we	see	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	people	 cheat 	 ing 	 	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	cause	us	?
so	,	we	did	 an 	 other 	 	experiment	.
we	got	a	big	group	of	 student 	 s 	 	to	be	in	the	experiment	,	and	we	 pre 	 paid 	 	them	.
so	 every 	 body 	 	got	an	 envelop 	 e 	 	with	all	the	money	for	the	experiment	,	and	we	told	them	that	at	the	end	,	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	to	pay	us	back	the	money	they	did	n't	make	.	ok	?
the	same	thing	 happen 	 s 	 	.
when	we	give	people	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	cheat	,	they	cheat	.
they	cheat	just	by	a	little	bit	,	all	the	same	.
but	in	 th 	 is 	 	experiment	we	 al 	 so 	 	 hire 	 d 	 	an	 act 	 ing 	 	student	.
 th 	 is 	 	 act 	 ing 	 	student	stood	up	after	30	 second 	 s 	 	,	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	 solve 	 d 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	.	what	do	i	do	now	?	``
and	the	 experiment 	 er 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	if	you	've	 finish 	 ed 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	,	go	home	.
that	's	it	.	the	task	is	 finish 	 ed 	 	.	``
so	,	now	we	had	a	student	--	an	 act 	 ing 	 	student	--	that	was	a	part	of	the	group	.
 no 	 body 	 	 k 	 new 	 	it	was	an	 a 	 ctor 	 	.
and	they	 clear 	 ly 	 	 cheat 	 ed 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	serious	way	.
what	would	happen	to	the	other	people	in	the	group	?
will	they	cheat	more	,	or	will	they	cheat	less	?
here	is	what	 happen 	 s 	 	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	it	 depend 	 s 	 	on	what	kind	of	 sweat 	 shirt 	 	they	're	 wear 	 ing 	 	.
here	is	the	thing	.
we	ran	 th 	 is 	 	at	carnegie	mellon	and	pittsburgh	.
and	at	pittsburgh	there	are	two	big	 un 	 ive 	 rs 	 ities 	 	,	carnegie	mellon	and	university	of	pittsburgh	.
all	of	the	 subject 	 s 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	the	experiment	 we 	 re 	 	carnegie	mellon	 student 	 s 	 	.
when	the	 a 	 ctor 	 	who	was	 get 	 ting 	 	up	was	a	carnegie	mellon	student	--	he	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	carnegie	mellon	student	--	but	he	was	a	part	of	 the 	 ir 	 	group	,	 cheat 	 ing 	 	went	up	.
but	when	he	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	a	university	of	pittsburgh	 sweat 	 shirt 	 	,	 cheat 	 ing 	 	went	down	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 import 	 ant 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	remember	,	when	the	moment	the	student	stood	up	,	it	made	it	clear	to	 every 	 body 	 	that	they	could	get	away	with	 cheat 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 experiment 	 er 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	've	 finish 	 ed 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	.	go	home	,	``	and	they	went	with	the	money	.
so	it	was	n't	so	much	about	the	 prob 	 ability 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	caught	 aga 	 in 	 	.
it	was	about	the	 norm 	 s 	 	for	 cheat 	 ing 	 	.
if	 some 	 body 	 	from	our	in	-	group	 cheat 	 s 	 	and	we	see	them	 cheat 	 ing 	 	,	we	feel	it	's	more	appropriate	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	group	,	to	 behav 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	way	.	but	if	it	's	 some 	 body 	 	from	 an 	 other 	 	group	,	these	 terr 	 ible 	 	people	--	i	mean	,	not	 terr 	 ible 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	--	but	 some 	 body 	 	we	do	n't	want	to	associate	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	with	,	from	 an 	 other 	 	university	,	 an 	 other 	 	group	,	all	of	a	sudden	people	's	 aware 	 ness 	 	of	 honest 	 y 	 	 go 	 es 	 	up	--	a	little	bit	like	the	ten	 command 	 ments 	 	experiment	--	and	people	cheat	even	less	.
so	,	what	have	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	about	 cheat 	 ing 	 	?
we	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	a	lot	of	people	can	cheat	.
they	cheat	just	by	a	little	bit	.
when	we	 re 	 mind 	 	people	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 moral 	 ity 	 	,	they	cheat	less	.
when	we	get	 big 	 ger 	 	distance	from	 cheat 	 ing 	 	,	from	the	object	of	money	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	people	cheat	more	.
and	when	we	see	 cheat 	 ing 	 	around	us	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	if	it	's	a	part	of	our	in	-	group	,	 cheat 	 ing 	 	 go 	 es 	 	up	.
now	,	if	we	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	stock	market	,	think	about	what	 happen 	 s 	 	.
what	 happen 	 s 	 	in	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	when	you	create	 some 	 thing 	 	where	you	pay	people	a	lot	of	money	to	see	 re 	 ality 	 	in	a	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 distort 	 ed 	 	way	?
would	they	not	be	able	to	see	it	 th 	 is 	 	way	?
of	course	they	would	.
what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	you	do	other	 thing 	 s 	 	,
like	you	 re 	 move 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	from	money	?
you	call	them	stock	,	or	stock	 option 	 s 	 	,	 deriv 	 ative 	 s 	 	,	mortgage	-	 back 	 ed 	 	securities	.
could	it	be	that	with	 t 	 hose 	 	more	 di 	 stant 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	it	's	not	a	 to 	 ken 	 	for	one	second	,	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	 man 	 y 	 	 step 	 s 	 	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	from	money	for	a	much	 long 	 er 	 	time	--	could	it	be	that	people	will	cheat	even	more	?
and	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	the	social	environment	when	people	see	other	people	 behav 	 e 	 	around	them	?
i	think	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 force 	 s 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	bad	way	in	the	stock	market	.
more	 general 	 ly 	 	,	i	want	to	tell	you	 some 	 thing 	 	about	 behavior 	 al 	 	 economic 	 s 	 	.
we	have	 man 	 y 	 	 intuit 	 ions 	 	in	our	life	,	and	the	point	is	that	 man 	 y 	 	of	these	 intuit 	 ions 	 	are	wrong	.
the	question	is	,	are	we	going	to	test	 t 	 hose 	 	 intuit 	 ions 	 	?
we	can	think	about	how	we	're	going	to	test	 th 	 is 	 	 intuit 	 ion 	 	in	our	private	life	,	in	our	business	life	,	and	most	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	when	it	 go 	 es 	 	to	policy	,	when	we	think	about	 thing 	 s 	 	like	no	child	left	 be 	 hind 	 	,	when	you	create	new	stock	 market 	 s 	 	,	when	you	create	other	 poli 	 cies 	 	--	 tax 	 ation 	 	,	health	care	and	so	on	.
and	the	 difficult 	 y 	 	of	 test 	 ing 	 	our	 intuit 	 ion 	 	was	the	big	 less 	 on 	 	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	when	i	went	back	to	the	 nurse 	 s 	 	to	talk	to	them	.
so	i	went	back	to	talk	to	them	and	tell	them	what	i	found	out	about	 re 	 moving 	 	 band 	 age 	 s 	 	.
and	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	two	 interest 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
one	was	that	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	nurse	,	ettie	,
told	me	that	i	did	not	take	her	pain	 in 	 to 	 	 consider 	 ation 	 	.
she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	of	course	,	you	know	,	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 pain 	 ful 	 	for	you	.
but	think	about	me	 a 	 s 	 	a	nurse	,	taking	,	 re 	 moving 	 	the	 band 	 age 	 s 	 	of	 some 	 body 	 	i	 like 	 d 	 	,	and	had	to	do	it	 repeat 	 ed 	 ly 	 	over	a	long	period	of	time	.
creating	so	much	torture	was	not	 some 	 thing 	 	that	was	good	for	me	,	too	.	``
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	 may 	 be 	 	part	of	the	reason	was	it	was	difficult	for	her	.
but	it	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	than	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	did	not	think	that	your	 intuit 	 ion 	 	was	right	.
i	felt	my	 intuit 	 ion 	 	was	correct	.	``
so	,	if	you	think	about	all	of	your	 intuit 	 ions 	 	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	your	 intuit 	 ion 	 	is	wrong	.
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 give 	 n 	 	the	fact	that	i	thought	my	 intuit 	 ion 	 	was	right	.	.	.	``	--	she	thought	her	 intuit 	 ion 	 	was	right	--	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	for	her	to	accept	 do 	 ing 	 	a	difficult	experiment	to	try	and	check	 whet 	 her 	 	she	was	wrong	.
but	in	fact	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	we	're	all	in	all	the	time	.
we	have	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	 intuit 	 ions 	 	about	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	--	our	own	ability	,	how	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	 work 	 s 	 	,	how	we	should	pay	school	 teacher 	 s 	 	.
but	 un 	 less 	 	we	start	 test 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 intuit 	 ions 	 	,	we	're	not	going	to	do	better	.
and	just	think	about	how	better	my	life	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	if	these	 nurse 	 s 	 	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	 will 	 ing 	 	to	check	 the 	 ir 	 	 intuit 	 ion 	 	,	and	how	 every 	 thing 	 	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	better	if	we	just	start	 do 	 ing 	 	more	 system 	 atic 	 	 experiment 	 ation 	 	of	our	 intuit 	 ions 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
