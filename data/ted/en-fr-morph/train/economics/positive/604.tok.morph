can	i	say	how	 de 	 light 	 ed 	 	i	am	to	be	away	from	the	calm	of	westminster	and	whitehall	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	kim	,	a	nine	-	year	-	old	vietnam	girl	,	her	back	 ruin 	 ed 	 	by	 na 	 palm 	 	,	and	she	 awake 	 ned 	 	the	 con 	 science 	 	of	the	nation	of	america	to	begin	to	end	the	vietnam	war	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	birhan	,	who	was	the	ethiopian	girl	who	 launch 	 ed 	 	live	aid	in	the	1980s	,	15	 minute 	 s 	 	away	from	death	when	she	was	 rescu 	 ed 	 	,	and	that	picture	of	her	 be 	 ing 	 	 rescu 	 ed 	 	is	one	that	went	round	the	world	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	tiananmen	square	.
a	man	before	a	tank	 be 	 came 	 	a	picture	that	 be 	 came 	 	a	symbol	for	the	whole	world	of	 resist 	 ance 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	next	is	the	sudanese	girl	,	a	few	 moment 	 s 	 	from	death	,	a	vulture	 hover 	 ing 	 	in	the	 back 	 ground 	 	,	a	picture	that	went	round	the	world	and	 shock 	 ed 	 	people	 in 	 to 	 	action	on	poverty	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	neda	,	the	iranian	girl	who	was	shot	while	at	a	 demonst 	 ration 	 	with	her	father	in	iran	 on 	 ly 	 	a	few	 week 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	she	is	now	the	focus	,	 right 	 ly 	 	so	,	of	the	youtube	generation	.
and	what	do	all	these	 picture 	 s 	 	and	 event 	 s 	 	have	in	common	?
what	they	have	in	common	is	what	we	see	 un 	 lock 	 s 	 	what	we	can	not	see	.
what	we	see	 un 	 lock 	 s 	 	the	 in 	 visible 	 	ties	and	 bond 	 s 	 	of	 sympath 	 y 	 	that	 br 	 ing 	 	us	together	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	human	community	.
what	these	 picture 	 s 	 	 demonst 	 rate 	 	is	that	we	do	feel	the	pain	of	 other 	 s 	 	,	 how 	 ever 	 	 di 	 stant 	 ly 	 	.
what	i	think	these	 picture 	 s 	 	 demonst 	 rate 	 	is	that	we	do	 believ 	 e 	 	in	 some 	 thing 	 	 big 	 ger 	 	than	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
what	these	 picture 	 s 	 	 demonst 	 rate 	 	is	that	there	is	a	moral	sense	 a 	 cross 	 	all	 relig 	 ions 	 	,	 a 	 cross 	 	all	 faith 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 cross 	 	all	 continent 	 s 	 	--	a	moral	sense	that	not	 on 	 ly 	 	do	we	share	the	pain	of	 other 	 s 	 	,	and	 believ 	 e 	 	in	 some 	 thing 	 	 big 	 ger 	 	than	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	but	we	have	a	duty	to	act	when	we	see	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	wrong	that	need	 right 	 ed 	 	,	see	 inju 	 ries 	 	that	need	to	be	 correct 	 ed 	 	,	see	 problem 	 s 	 	that	need	to	be	 rect 	 ified 	 	.
there	is	a	story	about	olof	palme	,	the	swedish	prime	 mini 	 ster 	 	,	going	to	see	ronald	reagan	in	america	in	the	1980s	.
before	he	 arriv 	 ed 	 	ronald	reagan	 s 	 aid 	 	--	and	he	was	the	swedish	social	 democrat 	 ic 	 	prime	 mini 	 ster 	 	--	``	is	n't	 th 	 is 	 	man	a	 commun 	 ist 	 	?	``
the	 re 	 ply 	 	was	,	``	no	,	mr	 p 	 resident 	 	,	he	's	an	anti	-	 commun 	 ist 	 	.	``
and	ronald	reagan	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	do	n't	care	what	kind	of	 commun 	 ist 	 	he	is	!	``
ronald	reagan	 ask 	 ed 	 	olof	palme	,	the	social	 democrat 	 ic 	 	prime	 mini 	 ster 	 	of	sweden	,	``	well	,	what	do	you	 believ 	 e 	 	in	?	do	you	want	to	abolish	the	rich	?	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	i	want	to	abolish	the	poor	.	``
our	 respons 	 ibility 	 	is	to	let	 every 	 one 	 	have	the	chance	to	 real 	 ize 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	potential	to	the	full	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	there	is	a	moral	sense	and	a	global	ethic	that	 command 	 s 	 	attention	from	people	of	every	 relig 	 ion 	 	and	every	faith	,	and	people	of	no	faith	.
but	i	think	what	's	new	is	that	we	now	have	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	communicate	 instantaneous 	 ly 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	 front 	 ier 	 s 	 	right	 a 	 cross 	 	the	world	.
we	now	have	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	find	common	ground	with	people	who	we	will	never	meet	,	but	who	we	will	meet	through	the	 inter 	 net 	 	and	through	all	the	modern	 mean 	 s 	 	of	communication	;	that	we	now	have	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	organize	and	take	 collect 	 ive 	 	action	together	to	deal	with	the	problem	or	an	 in 	 justice 	 	that	we	want	to	deal	with	;	and	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	 make 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	a	 un 	 ique 	 	age	in	human	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	and	it	is	the	start	of	what	i	would	call	the	creation	of	a	 tru 	 ly 	 	global	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
go	back	200	 year 	 s 	 	when	the	slave	trade	was	under	pressure	from	william	wilberforce	and	all	the	 protest 	 ers 	 	.
they	 protest 	 ed 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	britain	.
they	won	public	opinion	over	a	long	period	of	time	.
but	it	took	24	 year 	 s 	 	for	the	campaign	to	be	 success 	 ful 	 	.
what	could	they	have	 d 	 one 	 	with	the	 picture 	 s 	 	that	they	could	have	 show 	 n 	 	if	they	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	use	the	modern	 mean 	 s 	 	of	communication	to	win	people	's	 heart 	 s 	 	and	 mind 	 s 	 	?
or	if	you	take	eglantyne	jebb	,	the	woman	who	 create 	 d 	 	 s 	 ave 	 	the	children	90	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
she	was	so	 app 	 all 	 ed 	 	by	what	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	austria	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	the	first	world	war	and	what	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	to	children	who	 we 	 re 	 	part	of	the	 defeat 	 ed 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	of	austria	,	that	in	britain	she	 want 	 ed 	 	to	take	action	,	but	she	had	to	go	house	to	house	,	 leaf 	 let 	 	to	 leaf 	 let 	 	,	to	get	people	to	attend	a	 r 	 ally 	 	in	the	royal	albert	hall	that	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	birth	to	 s 	 ave 	 	the	children	,	an	 inter 	 national 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	that	is	now	fully	 recogn 	 ized 	 	 a 	 s 	 	one	of	the	great	 institution 	 s 	 	in	our	land	and	in	the	world	.
but	what	more	could	she	have	 d 	 one 	 	if	she	'd	had	the	modern	 mean 	 s 	 	of	 communication 	 s 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	to	her	to	create	a	sense	that	the	 in 	 justice 	 	that	people	saw	had	to	be	 act 	 ed 	 	 up 	 on 	 	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	?
now	look	at	what	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	last	10	 year 	 s 	 	.
in	philippines	in	2001	,	 p 	 resident 	 	estrada	--	a	million	people	 text 	 ed 	 	each	other	about	the	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	of	that	regime	,	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	it	down	and	it	was	,	of	course	,	 call 	 ed 	 	the	``	coup	de	text	.	``
then	you	have	in	zimbabwe	the	first	election	under	robert	mugabe	a	year	ago	.
 be 	 cause 	 	people	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	take	mobile	phone	 photograph 	 s 	 	of	what	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	at	the	 poll 	 ing 	 	 station 	 s 	 	,	it	was	 im 	 possible 	 	for	that	 pre 	 mi 	 er 	 	to	fix	that	election	in	the	way	that	he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	.
or	take	burma	and	the	 monk 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 b 	 logging 	 	out	,	a	country	that	 no 	 body 	 	 k 	 new 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	about	that	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	these	 blog 	 s 	 	told	the	world	that	there	was	a	 repress 	 ion 	 	,	meaning	that	 live 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	lost	and	people	 we 	 re 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 persecute 	 d 	 	and	aung	san	suu	kyi	,	who	is	one	of	the	great	 prisoner 	 s 	 	of	 con 	 science 	 	of	the	world	,	had	to	be	 listen 	 ed 	 	to	.
then	take	iran	 it 	 self 	 	,	and	what	people	are	 do 	 ing 	 	 to 	 day 	 	:	 follow 	 ing 	 	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	neda	,	people	who	are	 prevent 	 ing 	 	the	security	 service 	 s 	 	of	iran	 find 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	people	who	are	 b 	 logging 	 	out	of	iran	,	any	by	 every 	 body 	 	who	is	 b 	 logging 	 	,	changing	 the 	 ir 	 	address	to	tehran	,	iran	,	and	making	it	difficult	for	the	security	 service 	 s 	 	.
take	,	 there 	 fore 	 	,	what	modern	technology	is	 cap 	 able 	 	of	:	the	power	of	our	moral	sense	 all 	 ied 	 	to	the	power	of	 communication 	 s 	 	and	our	ability	to	organize	 inter 	 national 	 ly 	 	.
that	,	in	my	view	,	 give 	 s 	 	us	the	first	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	community	to	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	change	the	world	.
foreign	policy	can	never	be	the	same	 aga 	 in 	 	.	it	can	not	be	run	by	 elite 	 s 	 	;	it	's	got	to	be	run	by	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	the	public	 opinion 	 s 	 	of	 people 	 s 	 	who	are	 b 	 logging 	 	,	who	are	 commun 	 ic 	 ating 	 	with	each	other	around	the	world	.
200	 year 	 s 	 	ago	the	problem	we	had	to	solve	was	 slave 	 ry 	 	.
150	 year 	 s 	 	ago	i	suppose	the	main	problem	in	a	country	like	 our 	 s 	 	was	how	young	people	,	children	,	had	the	right	to	education	.
100	 year 	 s 	 	ago	in	most	 count 	 ries 	 	in	europe	,	the	pressure	was	for	the	right	to	vote	.
50	 year 	 s 	 	ago	the	pressure	was	for	the	right	to	social	security	and	 wel 	 fare 	 	.
in	the	last	50-60	 year 	 s 	 	we	have	 s 	 een 	 	 fasci 	 sm 	 	,	anti	-	semitism	,	 rac 	 ism 	 	,	apartheid	,	 discrimi 	 nation 	 	on	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	 s 	 ex 	 	and	gender	and	 sexual 	 ity 	 	;	all	these	have	come	under	pressure	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 campaign 	 s 	 	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	run	by	people	to	change	the	world	.
i	was	with	nelson	mandela	a	year	ago	,	when	he	was	in	london	.
i	was	at	a	concert	that	he	was	 attend 	 ing 	 	to	mark	his	 birth 	 day 	 	and	for	the	creation	of	new	 resource 	 s 	 	for	his	 found 	 ation 	 	.
i	was	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	next	to	nelson	mandela	--	i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 privilege 	 d 	 	to	do	so	--	when	amy	winehouse	came	onto	the	stage	.	and	nelson	mandela	was	 quit 	 e 	 	 surprise 	 d 	 	at	the	 appear 	 ance 	 	of	the	 s 	 ing 	 er 	 	and	i	was	 explain 	 ing 	 	to	him	at	the	time	who	she	was	.
amy	winehouse	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	nelson	mandela	and	i	have	a	lot	in	common	.
my	husband	too	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 pent 	 	a	long	time	in	 pri 	 son 	 	.	``
nelson	mandela	then	went	down	to	the	stage	and	he	 summarize 	 d 	 	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	for	us	all	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	in	his	 life 	 time 	 	he	had	 climb 	 ed 	 	a	great	mountain	,	the	mountain	of	 challeng 	 ing 	 	and	then	 defeat 	 ing 	 	racial	 oppress 	 ion 	 	and	 defeat 	 ing 	 	apartheid	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	that	there	was	a	 great 	 er 	 	 challeng 	 e 	 	 a 	 head 	 	,	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	of	poverty	,	of	climate	change	--	global	 challeng 	 es 	 	that	 need 	 ed 	 	global	 solution 	 s 	 	and	 need 	 ed 	 	the	creation	of	a	 tru 	 ly 	 	global	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
we	are	the	first	generation	which	is	in	a	position	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
combine	the	power	of	a	global	ethic	with	the	power	of	our	ability	to	communicate	and	organize	 global 	 ly 	 	,	with	the	 challeng 	 es 	 	that	we	now	face	,	most	of	which	are	global	in	 the 	 ir 	 	nature	.
climate	change	can	not	be	 solve 	 d 	 	in	one	country	,	but	 ha 	 s 	 	got	to	be	 solve 	 d 	 	by	the	world	 work 	 ing 	 	together	.
a	financial	crisis	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	we	have	 s 	 een 	 	,	could	not	be	 solve 	 d 	 	by	america	 al 	 one 	 	or	europe	 al 	 one 	 	;	it	 need 	 ed 	 	the	world	to	work	together	.
take	the	 problem 	 s 	 	of	security	and	 terror 	 ism 	 	and	,	 equal 	 ly 	 	,	the	problem	of	human	 right 	 s 	 	and	 develop 	 ment 	 	:	they	can	not	be	 solve 	 d 	 	by	africa	 al 	 one 	 	;	they	can	not	be	 solve 	 d 	 	by	america	or	europe	 al 	 one 	 	.
we	can	not	solve	these	 problem 	 s 	 	 un 	 less 	 	we	work	together	.
so	the	great	project	of	our	generation	,	it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	,	is	to	build	for	the	first	time	,	out	of	a	global	ethic	and	our	global	ability	to	communicate	and	organize	together	,	a	 tru 	 ly 	 	global	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	built	on	that	ethic	but	with	 institution 	 s 	 	that	can	serve	that	global	 socie 	 ty 	 	and	make	for	a	different	future	.
we	have	now	,	and	are	the	first	generation	with	,	the	power	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
take	climate	change	.	is	it	not	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 scandal 	 ous 	 	that	we	have	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	where	we	know	that	there	is	a	climate	change	problem	,	where	we	know	 al 	 so 	 	that	that	will	mean	we	have	to	give	more	 resource 	 s 	 	to	the	 poor 	 est 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	to	deal	with	that	,	when	we	want	to	create	a	global	carbon	market	,	but	there	is	no	global	institution	that	people	have	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	agree	 up 	 on 	 	to	deal	with	 th 	 is 	 	problem	?
one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	got	to	come	out	of	copenhagen	in	the	next	few	 month 	 s 	 	is	an	 agree 	 ment 	 	that	there	will	be	a	global	 environment 	 al 	 	institution	that	is	able	to	deal	with	the	 problem 	 s 	 	of	 persuad 	 ing 	 	the	whole	of	the	world	to	move	 a 	 long 	 	a	climate	-	change	agenda	.	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	why	an	institution	is	not	in	 it 	 self 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	is	that	we	have	got	to	 persuad 	 e 	 	people	around	the	world	to	change	 the 	 ir 	 	behavior	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	so	you	need	that	global	ethic	of	 fair 	 ness 	 	and	 respons 	 ibility 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 generation 	 s 	 	.
take	the	financial	crisis	.	if	people	in	 poor 	 er 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	can	be	hit	by	a	crisis	that	 start 	 s 	 	in	new	york	or	 start 	 s 	 	in	the	sub	-	prime	market	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	of	america	.
if	people	can	find	that	that	sub	-	prime	product	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 transfer 	 red 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	 un 	 til 	 	it	 end 	 s 	 	up	in	 bank 	 s 	 	in	iceland	or	the	rest	in	britain	,	and	people	's	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 saving 	 s 	 	are	 affect 	 ed 	 	by	it	,	then	you	can	not	 re 	 ly 	 	on	a	system	of	national	 super 	 vision 	 	.
you	need	in	the	long	run	for	 st 	 ability 	 	,	for	economic	growth	,	for	 job 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	for	financial	 st 	 ability 	 	,	global	economic	 institution 	 s 	 	that	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	growth	to	be	 sustain 	 ed 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 share 	 d 	 	,	and	are	built	on	the	principle	that	the	 prosper 	 ity 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	world	is	 indi 	 visible 	 	.
so	 an 	 other 	 	 challeng 	 e 	 	for	our	generation	is	to	create	global	 institution 	 s 	 	that	reflect	our	 idea 	 s 	 	of	 fair 	 ness 	 	and	 respons 	 ibility 	 	,	not	the	 idea 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	the	last	stage	of	financial	 develop 	 ment 	 	over	these	 re 	 cent 	 	 year 	 s 	 	.
then	take	 develop 	 ment 	 	and	take	the	 partner 	 ship 	 	we	need	between	our	 count 	 ries 	 	and	the	rest	of	the	world	,	the	 poor 	 est 	 	part	of	the	world	.
we	do	not	have	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	a	proper	 partner 	 ship 	 	for	the	future	,	and	yet	,	out	of	people	's	 desir 	 e 	 	for	a	global	ethic	and	a	global	 socie 	 ty 	 	that	can	be	 d 	 one 	 	.
i	have	just	 be 	 en 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	the	 p 	 resident 	 	of	sierra	leone	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	country	of	six	and	a	half	million	people	,	but	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	80	 doctor 	 s 	 	;	it	 ha 	 s 	 	200	 nurse 	 s 	 	;	it	 ha 	 s 	 	120	 mid 	 wives 	 	.
you	can	not	begin	to	build	a	 health 	 care 	 	system	for	six	million	people	with	 s 	 uch 	 	 limit 	 ed 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	.
or	take	the	girl	i	met	when	i	was	in	tanzania	,	a	girl	 call 	 ed 	 	miriam	.
she	was	11	 year 	 s 	 	old	;	her	 parent 	 s 	 	had	both	 di 	 ed 	 	from	 aid 	 s 	 	,	her	mother	and	then	her	father	.
she	was	an	 aid 	 s 	 	orphan	 be 	 ing 	 	 hand 	 ed 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	different	 extend 	 ed 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	to	be	 car 	 ed 	 	for	.
she	 her 	 self 	 	was	 suffer 	 ing 	 	from	hiv	;	she	was	 suffer 	 ing 	 	from	 tube 	 rculosis 	 	.
i	met	her	in	a	field	,	she	was	 rag 	 ged 	 	,	she	had	no	 shoe 	 s 	 	.
when	you	 look 	 ed 	 	in	her	 eye 	 s 	 	,	any	girl	at	the	age	of	eleven	is	looking	forward	to	the	future	,	but	there	was	an	 un 	 reach 	 able 	 	 s 	 ad 	 ness 	 	in	that	girl	's	 eye 	 s 	 	and	if	i	could	have	 transl 	 ated 	 	that	to	the	rest	of	the	world	for	that	moment	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	all	the	work	that	it	had	 d 	 one 	 	for	the	global	hiv	/	 aid 	 s 	 	fund	would	be	 reward 	 ed 	 	by	people	 be 	 ing 	 	prepared	to	make	 don 	 ations 	 	.
we	must	then	build	a	proper	relationship	between	the	 rich 	 est 	 	and	the	 poor 	 est 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	based	on	our	 desir 	 e 	 	that	they	are	able	to	 f 	 end 	 	for	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	with	the	 invest 	 ment 	 	that	is	 necess 	 ary 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 agricultur 	 e 	 	,	so	that	africa	is	not	a	net	 import 	 er 	 	of	food	,	but	an	 export 	 er 	 	of	food	.
take	the	 problem 	 s 	 	of	human	 right 	 s 	 	and	the	 problem 	 s 	 	of	security	in	so	 man 	 y 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	around	the	world	.

 be 	 side 	 	that	photograph	there	is	the	information	about	his	life	.
it	 s 	 aid 	 	``	david	,	age	10.	``
david	:	 ambit 	 ion 	 	to	be	a	doctor	.
 favor 	 ite 	 	 s 	 port 	 	:	 foot 	 ball 	 	.	what	did	he	enjoy	most	?
making	people	laugh	.
how	did	he	die	?
 torture 	 d 	 	to	death	.
last	 word 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	to	his	mother	who	was	 al 	 so 	 	 torture 	 d 	 	to	death	:	``	do	n't	worry	.	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	are	coming	.	``
and	we	never	did	.
and	that	young	boy	 believ 	 ed 	 	our	 promise 	 s 	 	that	we	would	help	people	in	 difficult 	 y 	 	in	rwanda	,	and	we	never	did	.
so	we	have	got	to	create	in	 th 	 is 	 	world	 al 	 so 	 	 institution 	 s 	 	for	 peace 	 keep 	 ing 	 	and	 human 	 itarian 	 	aid	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	for	 re 	 construction 	 	and	security	for	some	of	the	conflict	-	ridden	 state 	 s 	 	of	the	world	.
so	my	argument	 to 	 day 	 	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
we	have	the	 mean 	 s 	 	by	which	we	could	create	a	 tru 	 ly 	 	global	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
the	 institution 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	global	 socie 	 ty 	 	can	be	 create 	 d 	 	by	our	 endeavor 	 s 	 	.
that	global	ethic	can	 in 	 fuse 	 	the	 fair 	 ness 	 	and	 respons 	 ibility 	 	that	is	 necess 	 ary 	 	for	these	 institution 	 s 	 	to	work	,	but	we	should	not	lose	the	chance	in	 th 	 is 	 	generation	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	decade	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	with	 p 	 resident 	 	obama	in	america	,	with	other	people	 work 	 ing 	 	with	us	around	the	world	,	to	create	global	 institution 	 s 	 	for	the	environment	,	and	for	finance	,	and	for	security	and	for	 develop 	 ment 	 	,	that	make	sense	of	our	 respons 	 ibility 	 	to	other	 people 	 s 	 	,	our	 desir 	 e 	 	to	bind	the	world	together	,	and	our	need	to	tackle	 problem 	 s 	 	that	 every 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	exist	.
it	is	 s 	 aid 	 	that	in	ancient	rome	that	when	cicero	spoke	to	his	 audience 	 s 	 	,	people	used	to	turn	to	each	other	and	say	about	cicero	,	``	great	speech	.	``
but	it	is	 s 	 aid 	 	that	in	ancient	greece	when	demosthenes	spoke	to	his	 audience 	 s 	 	,	people	 turn 	 ed 	 	to	each	other	and	did	n't	say	``	great	speech	.	``
they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	let	's	march	.	``
we	should	be	 march 	 ing 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	a	global	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
thank	you	.
