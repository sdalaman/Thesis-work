 t 	 hose 	 	of	us	who	 believ 	 e 	 	in	heaven	have	some	sort	of	idea	of	what	heaven	would	be	.
and	in	my	idea	,	heaven	is	satisfied	curiosity	.
i	think	of	heaven	 a 	 s 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 comfort 	 able 	 	cloud	where	i	can	just	lie	down	with	my	 bel 	 ly 	 	down	,	like	i	was	 watch 	 ing 	 	tv	when	i	was	a	child	,	and	my	 elbow 	 s 	 	up	.
and	i	can	 bas 	 ically 	 	look	 every 	 where 	 	i	want	,	see	every	movie	i	've	 al 	 ways 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	see	.
and	in	the	same	kind	of	trance	that	you	can	feel	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	in	the	 sub 	 way 	 	in	new	york	when	you	're	 read 	 ing 	 	,
there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 so 	 oth 	 ing 	 	and	easy	.
well	,	the	funny	thing	is	that	i	 al 	 ready 	 	have	that	kind	of	life	,	in	a	way	,
 be 	 cause 	 	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	...	it	took	me	a	while	to	understand	it	,	but	when	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	around	24	 year 	 s 	 	of	age	that	i	was	much	more	 comfort 	 able 	 	with	 object 	 s 	 	than	with	people	,	i	 final 	 ly 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	to	 re 	 ally 	 	embrace	 th 	 is 	 	 pass 	 ion 	 	.
and	i	 bas 	 ically 	 	live	my	life	in	sort	of	a	trance	,
and	i	look	around	and	 every 	 thing 	 	i	see	is	just	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	a	long	story	.
just	to	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	,	humble	 master 	 piece 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	was	at	moma	in	2004	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	in	 que 	 en 	 s 	 	,
we	 we 	 re 	 	building	the	big	,	big	,	big	,	big	building	in	 mid 	 town 	 	,	so	we	 we 	 re 	 	in	the	small	,	small	,	small	 bo 	 on 	 dock 	 s 	 	.
that	was	one	of	the	 f 	 un 	 nest 	 	 moment 	 s 	 	of	my	 care 	 er 	 	.
but	it	's	not	 on 	 ly 	 	that	.
the	 type 	 face 	 	--	the	 type 	 face 	 	is	helvetica	;
it	's	 it 	 s 	 	50th	 annivers 	 ary 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	.
and	so	i	start	 think 	 ing 	 	--	max	miedinger	and	all	 t 	 hose 	 	swiss	 design 	 ers 	 	together	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 out 	 do 	 	akzidenz	-	grotesk	,	and	come	up	with	a	new	sans	-	serif	 type 	 face 	 	--
and	the	movie	 start 	 s 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	in	my	head	 al 	 ready 	 	.
and	of	course	,	you	can	imagine	,	with	humble	 master 	 piece 	 s 	 	it	was	the	same	thing	 multi 	 plied 	 	by	a	hundred	.
and	i	do	hope	,	by	the	way	,	that	the	real	goal	of	the	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	is	going	to	have	the	same	effect	on	you	.
the	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	was	 me 	 ant 	 	to	be	a	way	to	have	children	think	of	 do 	 ing 	 	...	you	know	when	they	do	 home 	 work 	 s 	 	at	home	?
 in 	 stead 	 	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	tray	with	two	 pea 	 s 	 	,	i	was	 hop 	 ing 	 	that	they	would	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	kitchen	cabinet	or	the	mother	's	 hand 	 bag 	 	and	do	 the 	 ir 	 	museum	-	quality	design	 collect 	 ion 	 	on	a	tray	.
so	,	 every 	 body 	 	's	 al 	 ways 	 	 suggest 	 ing 	 	new	humble	 master 	 piece 	 s 	 	,
and	at	moma	we	put	out	some	 book 	 s 	 	just	for	people	to	suggest	 the 	 ir 	 	own	humble	 master 	 piece 	 s 	 	.
and	when	you	do	that	,	 usual 	 ly 	 	you	get	80	percent	porn	and	20	percent	real	 suggest 	 ions 	 	,
and	 in 	 stead 	 	it	was	all	--	 al 	 most 	 	--	all	good	 suggest 	 ions 	 	.
and	a	lot	of	 national 	 ism 	 	came	in	.
for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	i	did	n't	know	that	the	spaniards	 invent 	 ed 	 	the	mop	,	but	they	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	proud
so	every	spaniard	 s 	 aid 	 	``	la	 fre 	 go 	 	.	``	and	italians	did	the	pizza	.
and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	show	you	,	 al 	 so 	 	,	the	 suggest 	 ions 	 	from	kentucky	are	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	--	they	had	 moon 	 shine 	 	,	 laundr 	 y 	 	 detergent 	 s 	 	and	liquid	 nail 	 s 	 	.
and	i	keep	it	going	,	and	i	just	got	,	 al 	 so 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 suggest 	 ion 	 	from	milan	:	it	's	our	traffic	 divid 	 er 	 	,	which	we	call	``	 pan 	 et 	 tone 	 	,	``	and	it	's	 paint 	 ed 	 	;	it	's	these	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	use	around	milan	to	define	all	the	 lane 	 s 	 	of	traffic	.
so	,	think	of	your	own	,
 s 	 end 	 	them	on	if	you	want	to	--	they	're	 al 	 ways 	 	welcome	.
but	an	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	like	that	made	me	understand	even	more	what	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	of	for	13	 year 	 s 	 	ever	since	i	got	to	moma	.
i	'm	italian	.	in	italy	,	design	is	normal	.
different	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	world	have	a	 kn 	 ack 	 	for	different	 thing 	 s 	 	.
i	was	just	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	in	argentina	and	in	uruguay	,	and	the	default	way	of	building	 home 	 s 	 	in	the	country	is	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 modern 	 ism 	 	that	you	do	n't	see	 else 	 where 	 	,	but	the	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	art	was	 terr 	 ible 	 	.
in	italy	,	in	milan	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	,	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	art	 re 	 ally 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	that	much	of	a	place	.
but	design	--	oh	,	my	god	.
what	you	find	at	the	store	at	the	corner	,	 with 	 out 	 	going	to	any	kind	of	 f 	 ancy 	 	store	,	is	the	kind	of	 refine 	 d 	 	design	that	 make 	 s 	 	 every 	 body 	 	think	that	we	are	all	so	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	.
it	's	just	what	you	find	at	the	store	.
and	new	york	 ha 	 s 	 	 an 	 other 	 	kind	of	 kn 	 ack 	 	for	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	art	.
i	'm	 al 	 ways 	 	 amaz 	 ed 	 	--	three	-	year	-	olds	know	who	richard	serra	is	and	take	you	to	the	 gall 	 eries 	 	.
but	design	,	for	some	reason	,	is	still	 mis 	 under 	 stood 	 	for	 decor 	 ation 	 	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	:
what	 man 	 y 	 	people	think	when	i	say	the	word	``	design	``	is	they	think	of	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 over 	 designed 	 	--	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	it	's	 over 	 designed 	 	on	purpose	,	but	--	 decor 	 ation 	 	,	 in 	 terior 	 	 decor 	 ation 	 	.
they	think	of	 some 	 body 	 	 choos 	 ing 	 	 fabric 	 s 	 	.
design	can	be	that	,	of	course	,	but	it	can	 al 	 so 	 	be	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	can	be	a	school	of	design	in	jerusalem	that	tries	to	find	a	better	way	to	design	gas	 mask 	 s 	 	for	people	,
 be 	 cause 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	know	,	israel	 deploy 	 s 	 	one	gas	mask	per	person	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 bab 	 ies 	 	.
so	,	what	these	 design 	 ers 	 	do	is	they	find	a	way	to	lower	the	 neck 	 line 	 	,	so	that	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	 strangle 	 d 	 	,	a	teenager	can	 al 	 so 	 	 s 	 ip 	 	a	 co 	 ke 	 	.
they	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	make	a	toddler	's	gas	mask	in	 s 	 uch 	 	a	way	that	the	toddler	can	be	held	by	the	parent	 be 	 cause 	 	 proxim 	 ity 	 	of	the	body	is	so	 import 	 ant 	 	.	and	then	they	make	a	little	tent	for	the	baby	.
 how 	 ever 	 	cruel	,	 how 	 ever 	 	 ruth 	 less 	 	you	can	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	it	's	a	great	design	,
and	it	is	 mile 	 s 	 	away	from	the	 f 	 ancy 	 	furniture	,	but	still	,	it	's	part	of	my	same	field	of	 pass 	 ion 	 	.
what	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	at	moma	since	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	is	to	try	to	harness	the	power	of	moma
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	great	to	work	there	.	you	 re 	 ally 	 	have	power	in	that	people	 usual 	 ly 	 	tend	to	know	about	your	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	or	see	the	 exhibit 	 ions 	 	,
and	that	is	power	 be 	 cause 	 	in	a	design	museum	i	would	n't	have	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 visit 	 ors 	 	.
i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	well	aware	that	80	percent	of	my	public	is	there	to	see	picasso	and	matisse	,
and	then	they	 s 	 tumble 	 	 up 	 on 	 	my	show	and	i	keep	them	there	.
but	what	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	the	 cur 	 ators 	 	at	moma	in	my	 depart 	 ment 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	ever	since	the	museum	was	 found 	 ed 	 	in	1929	,	which	is	to	try	and	see	what	's	going	on	in	the	world	and	try	to	use	that	 author 	 ity 	 	in	order	to	make	 thing 	 s 	 	better	.
there	have	 be 	 en 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 episode 	 s 	 	,	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	eames	demetrius	may	be	here	in	the	audience	,
but	in	two	 in 	 stance 	 s 	 	,	his	great	-	 grand 	 father 	 	,	 grand 	 father 	 	--	i	'm	 al 	 ways 	 	a	little	 per 	 plex 	 ed 	 	about	the	relation	,	 exact 	 ly 	 	--
charles	eames	the	first	time	and	then	charles	and	ray	eames	the	second	time	 we 	 re 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	two	 com 	 petition 	 s 	 	:
one	in	1940	,	it	was	about	 organ 	 ic 	 	furniture	,	and	the	second	one	in	1948	was	low	-	cost	furniture	for	the	gis	coming	back	from	the	war	that	then	 spark 	 ed 	 	a	whole	line	of	furniture	.
and	then	there	was	good	design	for	 ver 	 y 	 	low	price	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	a	lot	of	 program 	 s 	 	in	 architect 	 ure 	 	and	design	that	 we 	 re 	 	about	 point 	 ing 	 	people	in	the	direction	of	a	better	design	for	a	better	life	.
so	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	out	in	'95	with	 th 	 is 	 	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	that	was	 call 	 ed 	 	 mut 	 ant 	 	 material 	 s 	 	in	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	design	.
it	was	about	a	new	phase	,	in	my	opinion	,	in	the	world	of	design	in	that	 material 	 s 	 	could	be	 custom 	 ized 	 	by	the	 design 	 ers 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
and	that	put	me	in	touch	with	 s 	 uch 	 	 divers 	 e 	 	design	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 aero 	 gel 	 s 	 	from	the	lawrence	livermore	lab	in	california	;
at	that	time	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	be	 br 	 ought 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 civil 	 ian 	 	market	.
and	at	the	same	time	,	the	 gorge 	 ous 	 	work	of	takeshi	ishiguro	,	who	did	these	 beaut 	 iful 	 	salt	-	and	-	pepper	 contain 	 ers 	 	that	are	made	of	rice	dough	.
so	you	see	,	the	range	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 divers 	 e 	 	.
and	then	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	other	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	that	was	 en 	 titled 	 	workspheres	in	2001	,	where	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	different	 design 	 ers 	 	to	come	up	with	 idea 	 s 	 	for	the	new	type	of	work	 style 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	the	world	at	that	time	.
and	you	see	ideo	there	.
it	was	 beaut 	 iful 	 	--	it	was	 call 	 ed 	 	personal	 ski 	 es 	 	.
the	idea	was	that	if	you	had	a	 cubic 	 le 	 	,	you	could	project	a	sky	on	top	of	your	head	and	have	your	own	``	cielo	in	una	stanza	``	--	a	sky	in	a	room	--
it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	famous	italian	song	.
and	other	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	:	 th 	 is 	 	was	marti	guixe	about	 work 	 ing 	 	on	the	go	,
and	hella	jongerius	,	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	,	about	how	to	work	at	home	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	lets	me	 introduc 	 e 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	idea	about	design	:
 design 	 ers 	 	are	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 synthesize 	 rs 	 	in	the	world	.
what	they	do	best	is	make	a	synthesis	of	human	 need 	 s 	 	,	current	 condition 	 s 	 	in	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	in	 material 	 s 	 	,	in	 sustain 	 ability 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	,
and	then	what	they	do	at	the	end	--	if	they	are	good	--	is	much	more	than	the	sum	of	 it 	 s 	 	 part 	 s 	 	.
hella	jongerius	is	a	person	that	is	able	to	make	a	synthesis	that	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	hilarious	.
the	idea	 be 	 hind 	 	her	work	was	that	at	that	time	,	 every 	 body 	 	was	 say 	 ing 	 	you	have	to	 re 	 ally 	 	divide	your	life	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	no	.	work	and	leisure	can	be	together	.	``
 yea 	 h 	 	,	that	's	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 gorge 	 ous 	 	--	it	's	the	tv	 d 	 inner 	 	of	2001	.
there	have	 be 	 en 	 	 man 	 y 	 	other	 exhibit 	 ions 	 	in	the	 mean 	 time 	 	,	but	i	do	n't	want	to	focus	on	my	 show 	 s 	 	.
i	would	like	,	 in 	 stead 	 	,	to	talk	about	how	great	some	 design 	 ers 	 	are	.
i	've	 al 	 ways 	 	had	a	hard	time	with	the	word	``	maverick	.	``
i	came	to	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	13	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	to	 th 	 is 	 	day	i	have	to	ask	,	``	what	 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	?	``
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	i	went	to	see	on	the	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	and	it	 s 	 aid 	 	that	there	was	 th 	 is 	 	 gentle 	 man 	 	that	was	not	 brand 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	cattle	.
 there 	 fore 	 	,	he	was	not	 follow 	 ing 	 	 every 	 body 	 	's	lead	,	and	 there 	 fore 	 	,	he	was	a	maverick	.
so	,	 design 	 ers 	 	do	need	to	be	 maverick 	 s 	 	,
 be 	 cause 	 	the	best	way	to	design	a	 success 	 ful 	 	object	--	and	 al 	 so 	 	an	object	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	before	--	is	to	pretend	that	either	it	never	 exist 	 ed 	 	or	that	people	will	be	able	to	have	a	new	behavior	with	it	.
so	,	safe	is	the	last	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	that	i	did	at	moma
and	it	 end 	 ed 	 	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	last	year	.	it	was	about	design	that	 deal 	 s 	 	with	 safe 	 ty 	 	and	 deal 	 s 	 	with	 protect 	 ion 	 	.
it	's	a	long	story	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 start 	 ed 	 	before	2001	and	it	was	 call 	 ed 	 	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	.
and	then	when	9/11	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	i	had	a	shock	and	i	 cancel 	 ed 	 	the	 exhibit 	 ion 	 
 un 	 til 	 	,	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	but	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	,	it	came	back	--	 a 	 s 	 	a	half	-	full	glass	 in 	 stead 	 	of	half	-	empty	--	and	it	was	about	 protect 	 ion 	 	and	 safe 	 ty 	 	.
but	it	 rang 	 ed 	 	from	 s 	 uch 	 	 item 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	complete	de	-	 min 	 ing 	 	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	to	these	kind	of	water	-	 steril 	 izing 	 	 straw 	 s 	 	,
so	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	wide	-	ranging	.
it	 al 	 so 	 	had	...	you	know	,	cameron	and	i	 work 	 ed 	 	a	little	bit	together	,
and	some	of	the	 ent 	 ries 	 	that	you	see	in	his	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	in	the	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	.
but	what	is	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	that	we	do	n't	need	to	talk	about	design	and	art	 any 	 more 	 	;
design	uses	 what 	 ever 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	at	 it 	 s 	 	 dispos 	 al 	 	in	order	to	make	a	point	.
it	's	a	sense	of	 eco 	 nomy 	 	and	a	sense	,	 al 	 so 	 	,	of	humor	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	project	by	ralph	borland	,	who	's	south	african	.
it	's	a	suit	for	civil	 dis 	 obedi 	 ence 	 	.
the	idea	is	that	when	you	have	a	riot	or	a	protest	and	the	police	 come 	 s 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	you	,	you	're	 wear 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	thing	--
it	's	like	a	big	heart	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 loud 	 speaker 	 	over	your	heart	so	your	 heart 	 beat 	 	is	 ampl 	 ified 	 	--
and	the	police	is	 re 	 minded 	 	;	it	's	like	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	flower	in	front	of	the	rifle	.	and	 al 	 so 	 	,	you	can	imagine	,	a	whole	group	of	people	with	the	same	suit	will	have	 th 	 is 	 	 mount 	 ing 	 	 collect 	 ive 	 	 heart 	 beat 	 	that	will	be	 scar 	 y 	 	to	the	police	.
so	,	 design 	 ers 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	do	n't	do	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	functional	,	but	they	're	functional	to	our	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	 issue 	 s 	 	.
tony	dunne	and	fiona	raby	did	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 object 	 s 	 	that	are	about	our	 angu 	 ish 	 	and	our	 para 	 no 	 ia 	 	,
like	 th 	 is 	 	 hide 	 away 	 	furniture	that	's	made	in	the	same	wood	 a 	 s 	 	your	floor	so	it	 disappear 	 s 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	and	you	can	hide	away	;
or	even	better	,	the	 hugg 	 able 	 	atomic	mushroom	,	which	got	me	an	article	on	the	 bullet 	 in 	 	of	atomic	 scientist 	 s 	 	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	--
i	do	n't	think	it	ever	 happen 	 ed 	 	before	at	moma	;
or	 th 	 is 	 	faraday	chair	that	is	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	protect	you	from	 radi 	 ations 	 	.
but	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	in	the	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	is	the	 discover 	 y 	 	that	the	ultimate	shelter	is	your	sense	of	self	,	and	there	are	 quit 	 e 	 	a	few	 design 	 ers 	 	that	are	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	 top 	 ic 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	cindy	van	den	bremen	,	who	is	a	dutch	 design 	 er 	 	that	's	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 eries 	 	of	capsters	.
they	are	athletic	gear	for	muslim	women	that	 en 	 able 	 	them	to	ski	,	play	tennis	,	do	 what 	 ever 	 	they	want	to	do	 with 	 out 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	 un 	 cap 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	by	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	research	,	you	 en 	 counter 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	of	design	.
twan	verdonck	is	 re 	 ally 	 	young	,	i	think	he	's	27	,	and	 work 	 ing 	 	together	with	some	 psycho 	 logist 	 	he	did	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	that	are	for	 sensor 	 ial 	 	 stimul 	 ation 	 	for	children	that	have	 psycho 	 logical 	 	 impair 	 ments 	 	.
they	're	 quit 	 e 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
they	range	from	 th 	 is 	 	 flu 	 ffy 	 	 to 	 y 	 	that	is	about	 hugg 	 ing 	 	you	--	 be 	 cause 	 	 aut 	 istic 	 	children	like	to	be	 hugg 	 ed 	 	tight	,	so	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	spring	 in 	 side 	 	--	all	the	way	to	 th 	 is 	 	doll	with	a	mirror	so	the	child	can	see	him	or	 her 	 self 	 	in	the	mirror	and	regain	a	sense	of	self	.
design	 re 	 ally 	 	 look 	 s 	 	 up 	 on 	 	the	whole	world	and	it	 consider 	 s 	 	the	world	in	all	of	 it 	 s 	 	different	 range 	 s 	 	.
i	was	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	at	a	 con 	 ference 	 	on	 luxur 	 y 	 	 organize 	 d 	 	by	the	herald	tribune	in	istanbul	.
and	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	the	last	speaker	and	before	me	there	 we 	 re 	 	people	that	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 luxur 	 y 	 	,
and	i	did	n't	want	to	be	a	party	 poop 	 er 	 	but	at	the	same	time	i	felt	that	i	had	to	kind	of	 br 	 ing 	 	back	the	 dis 	 course 	 	to	 re 	 ality 	 	.
and	the	truth	is	that	there	are	 ver 	 y 	 	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 luxur 	 y 	 	,
and	there	's	 luxur 	 y 	 	that	is	 relat 	 ive 	 	for	people	that	do	n't	have	that	much	.
i	want	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	point	by	 show 	 ing 	 	you	two	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	design	coming	from	a	sense	of	 eco 	 nomy 	 	--	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	 limit 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	cuba	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 recycl 	 ing 	 	of	a	 squeak 	 y 	 	 to 	 y 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 bi 	 cycle 	 	bell	,
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 rain 	 coat 	 	that	is	made	out	of	rice	 s 	 ack 	 s 	 	.
so	they	're	 quit 	 e 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	but	they	're	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	so	smart	and	 economic 	 al 	 	.
and	here	is	the	work	of	two	 brother 	 s 	 	from	sao	paulo	,	fernando	and	humberto	campana	,	who	got	inspired	by	the	poverty	and	 smart 	 ness 	 	that	they	saw	around	them	to	do	 piece 	 s 	 	of	furniture	that	now	are	selling	for	an	enormous	amount	of	money	.
but	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	kind	of	 strange 	 ness 	 	of	the	market	 it 	 self 	 	.
so	 re 	 ally 	 	,	design	 take 	 s 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	account	,
and	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	is	that	 a 	 s 	 	the	technology	 advance 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	 be 	 come 	 	more	and	more	 wire 	 less 	 	and	 im 	 palp 	 able 	 	,	 design 	 ers 	 	,	 in 	 stead 	 	,	want	us	to	be	 hand 	 s 	 	-	on	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	hammer	-	on	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	whole	 s 	 eries 	 	of	furniture	that	 want 	 s 	 	to	engage	you	 physical 	 ly 	 	.
even	 th 	 is 	 	chair	that	you	have	to	open	up	and	then	 s 	 it 	 	on	so	that	it	 take 	 s 	 	your	 im 	 print 	 	,	all	the	way	to	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 object 	 s 	 	that	are	 consider 	 ed 	 	design	by	ana	mir	in	barcelona	.
from	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 bi 	 jou 	 	made	with	human	hair	to	these	chocolate	 nipple 	 s 	 	to	these	intra	-	 to 	 e 	 	 can 	 dies 	 	that	your	lover	is	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	suck	from	your	 to 	 es 	 	.
it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 some 	 how 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 gorge 	 ous 	 	moment	for	design	.
 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	ago	i	heard	a	 mathematic 	 ian 	 	from	vienna	,	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	name	was	marchetti	,	explain	how	the	 innov 	 ation 	 	in	the	 militar 	 y 	 	industry	--	 there 	 fore 	 	,	secret	 innov 	 ation 	 	--	and	the	 innov 	 ation 	 	in	the	 civil 	 ian 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	are	two	sinusoids	that	are	kind	of	 oppos 	 ed 	 	.
and	that	 make 	 s 	 	sense	.
in	 moment 	 s 	 	of	war	there	's	great	 techno 	 logical 	 	 innov 	 ation 	 	,
and	in	the	world	you	have	to	do	 with 	 out 	 	--	well	,	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	second	world	war	,	you	had	to	do	 with 	 out 	 	steel	,	you	had	to	do	 with 	 out 	 	 a 	 lumin 	 um 	 	.
and	then	 a 	 s 	 	peace	 come 	 s 	 	,	all	of	these	 techno 	 logies 	 	get	all	of	a	sudden	 avail 	 able 	 	for	the	 civil 	 ian 	 	market	.
 man 	 y 	 	of	you	might	know	that	the	potato	chip	chair	by	charles	and	ray	eames	 come 	 s 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	from	that	kind	of	 in 	 stance 	 	:
 fiber 	 glass 	 	was	 avail 	 able 	 	for	 civil 	 ian 	 	use	all	of	a	sudden	.
i	think	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	strange	moment	.
the	rhythm	of	the	sinusoids	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	 tremendous 	 ly 	 	,	just	like	the	rhythm	of	our	life	in	the	past	25	 year 	 s 	 	,
so	i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	 any 	 more 	 	what	the	 wave 	 length 	 	is	.
but	it	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	moment	for	design	,
 be 	 cause 	 	not	 on 	 ly 	 	is	the	technology	 proceed 	 ing 	 	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	is	computing	technology	making	open	-	source	possible	 al 	 so 	 	in	the	world	of	design	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	the	idea	of	 sustain 	 ability 	 	--	which	is	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 sustain 	 ability 	 	from	the	 view 	 point 	 	of	co	2	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	and	 foot 	 print 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 sustain 	 ability 	 	of	human	 inter 	 relationship 	 s 	 	--	is	 ver 	 y 	 	much	part	of	the	work	of	so	 man 	 y 	 	 design 	 ers 	 	.
and	that	's	why	 design 	 ers 	 	,	more	and	more	,	are	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 behavior 	 s 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	on	 object 	 s 	 	.
 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	the	good	 one 	 s 	 	,	not	all	of	them	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	show	you	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	the	work	of	mathieu	lehanneur	,	which	is	 quit 	 e 	 	fantastic	.
he	's	 an 	 other 	 	young	 design 	 er 	 	from	france	who	's	 work 	 ing 	 	--	and	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	he	's	 work 	 ing 	 	,	 al 	 so 	 	,	with	pharmaceutical	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	--	on	new	ways	to	engage	 patient 	 s 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	children	,	in	taking	 the 	 ir 	 	 medicine 	 s 	 	with	 con 	 st 	 ancy 	 	and	with	 certain 	 ty 	 	.
for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 contain 	 er 	 	for	asthma	medicine	that	kind	of	 infla 	 tes 	 	 it 	 self 	 	when	it	's	time	for	you	to	take	the	medicine	,
so	the	child	 ha 	 s 	 	to	go	--	pffff	!	--	to	 re 	 lease 	 	and	 reliev 	 e 	 	the	 contain 	 er 	 	 it 	 self 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	other	medicine	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	you	can	draw	on	your	skin	,
so	 intra 	 der 	 mal 	 	 deliver 	 y 	 	 en 	 able 	 s 	 	you	to	 joy 	 fully 	 	be	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	kind	of	 deliver 	 y 	 	.
 similar 	 ly 	 	,	there	's	the	work	of	people	like	marti	guixe	that	tries	to	involve	you	in	a	way	that	is	 re 	 ally 	 	about	making	 every 	 thing 	 	pass	through	your	mouth
so	that	you	learn	from	your	 mistak 	 es 	 	or	from	your	taste	,	 or 	 ally 	 	.
the	next	show	that	i	'm	going	to	work	on	--	and	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 bug 	 ging 	 	a	lot	of	you	about	 th 	 is 	 	here	--	is	about	the	relationship	between	design	and	science	.
i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	find	not	the	 metaphor 	 s 	 	,	but	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	,	the	 point 	 s 	 	in	common	--	the	common	 grip 	 es 	 	,	the	common	 issue 	 s 	 	,	the	common	 pre 	 occupation 	 s 	 	--
and	i	think	that	it	will	 en 	 able 	 	us	to	go	a	little	further	in	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	design	 a 	 s 	 	an	 instruct 	 ion 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	direction	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	a	prescription	of	form	.
and	i	am	 hop 	 ing 	 	that	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	will	respond	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	've	 s 	 ent 	 	an	email	 al 	 ready 	 	to	 quit 	 e 	 	a	few	of	you	.
but	design	and	science	and	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	 visual 	 izing 	 	different	 scale 	 s 	 	,	and	 there 	 fore 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	work	at	the	scale	of	the	 ver 	 y 	 	small	to	make	it	 ver 	 y 	 	big	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 meaning 	 ful 	 	.
thank	you	.
