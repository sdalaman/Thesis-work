 th 	 is 	 	is	the	venue	where	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	young	man	,	some	of	the	music	that	i	wrote	was	first	 perform 	 ed 	 	.
it	was	,	 remark 	 ably 	 	,	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	 sound 	 ing 	 	room	.
with	all	the	 un 	 even 	 	 wall 	 s 	 	and	all	the	crap	 every 	 where 	 	,	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 sound 	 ed 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	song	that	was	 record 	 ed 	 	there	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	 head 	 s 	 	,	in	the	picture	 any 	 way 	 	.
``	by	 talk 	 ing 	 	 head 	 s 	 	)	so	the	nature	of	the	room	 me 	 ant 	 	that	 word 	 s 	 	could	be	 under 	 stood 	 	.
the	 lyric 	 s 	 	of	the	 song 	 s 	 	could	be	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 under 	 stood 	 	.
the	sound	system	was	kind	of	 de 	 cent 	 	.
and	there	was	n't	a	lot	of	 reverbe 	 ration 	 	in	the	room	.
so	the	 rhythm 	 s 	 	could	be	 pre 	 tty 	 	 in 	 tact 	 	too	,	 pre 	 tty 	 	 con 	 cise 	 	.
other	 place 	 s 	 	around	the	country	had	similar	rooms	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	tootsie	's	orchid	 loung 	 e 	 	in	nashville	.
the	music	was	in	some	ways	different	,	but	in	structure	and	form	,	 ver 	 y 	 	much	the	same	.
the	 client 	 ele 	 	behavior	was	 ver 	 y 	 	much	the	same	too	.
and	so	the	 band 	 s 	 	at	tootsie	's	or	at	cbgb	's	had	to	play	loud	 en 	 ough 	 	--	the	volume	had	to	be	loud	 en 	 ough 	 	to	 over 	 come 	 	people	 fall 	 ing 	 	down	,	 shout 	 ing 	 	out	and	 do 	 ing 	 	 what 	 ever 	 	else	they	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	.
since	then	,	i	've	 play 	 ed 	 	other	 place 	 s 	 	that	are	much	 nic 	 er 	 	.
i	've	 play 	 ed 	 	the	disney	hall	here	and	carnegie	hall	and	 place 	 s 	 	like	that	.
and	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	.
but	i	 al 	 so 	 	 notice 	 d 	 	that	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	the	music	that	i	had	written	,	or	was	writing	at	the	time	,	did	n't	sound	all	that	great	in	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 hall 	 s 	 	.
we	 manage 	 d 	 	,	but	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 hall 	 s 	 	did	n't	seem	 exact 	 ly 	 	 suit 	 ed 	 	to	the	music	i	was	making	or	had	made	.
so	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	 my 	 self 	 	:	do	i	write	stuff	for	specific	rooms	?
do	i	have	a	place	,	a	venue	,	in	mind	when	i	write	?
is	that	a	kind	of	model	for	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	?
do	we	all	make	 thing 	 s 	 	with	a	venue	,	a	 con 	 text 	 	,	in	mind	?
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	africa	.
most	of	the	popular	music	that	we	know	now	 ha 	 s 	 	a	big	part	of	 it 	 s 	 	 root 	 s 	 	in	west	africa	.
and	the	music	there	,	i	would	say	,	the	 instrument 	 s 	 	,	the	 intric 	 ate 	 	 rhythm 	 s 	 	,	the	way	it	's	 play 	 ed 	 	,	the	setting	,	the	 con 	 text 	 	,	it	's	all	perfect	.	it	all	 work 	 s 	 	perfect	.
the	music	 work 	 s 	 	 perfect 	 ly 	 	in	that	setting	.
there	's	no	big	room	to	create	 reverbe 	 ration 	 	and	 con 	 fuse 	 	the	 rhythm 	 s 	 	.
the	 instrument 	 s 	 	are	loud	 en 	 ough 	 	that	they	can	be	heard	 with 	 out 	 	 ampl 	 ification 	 	,	etc	.	,	etc	.
it	's	no	accident	.
it	's	perfect	for	that	 part 	 icular 	 	 con 	 text 	 	.
and	it	would	be	a	mess	in	a	 con 	 text 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 got 	 hic 	 	 cat 	 hedral 	 	.
in	a	 got 	 hic 	 	 cat 	 hedral 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	music	is	perfect	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	change	key	,	the	 note 	 s 	 	are	long	,
there	's	 al 	 most 	 	no	rhythm	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	,
and	the	room	 flatter 	 s 	 	the	music	.
it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 improve 	 s 	 	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	room	that	bach	wrote	some	of	his	music	for	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	organ	.
it	's	not	 a 	 s 	 	big	 a 	 s 	 	a	 got 	 hic 	 	 cat 	 hedral 	 	,	so	he	can	write	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	a	little	bit	more	 intric 	 ate 	 	.
he	can	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 innov 	 ative 	 ly 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	change	 key 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 risk 	 ing 	 	huge	 dissonance 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	little	bit	 lat 	 er 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	kind	of	rooms	that	mozart	wrote	in	.
i	think	we	're	in	like	1770	,	 some 	 where 	 	around	there	.
they	're	 small 	 er 	 	,	even	less	 reverbe 	 rant 	 	,	so	he	can	write	 re 	 ally 	 	 frill 	 y 	 	music	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 intric 	 ate 	 	--	and	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
it	 fit 	 s 	 	the	room	 perfect 	 ly 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	la	scala	.
it	's	around	the	same	time	,
i	think	it	was	built	around	1776	.
people	in	the	audience	in	these	opera	 house 	 s 	 	,	when	they	 we 	 re 	 	built	,	they	used	to	yell	out	to	one	 an 	 other 	 	.
they	used	to	eat	,	drink	and	yell	out	to	people	on	the	stage	,	just	like	they	do	at	cbgb	's	and	 place 	 s 	 	like	that	.
if	they	 like 	 d 	 	an	aria	,	they	would	holler	and	suggest	that	it	be	 d 	 one 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	 en 	 core 	 	,	not	at	the	end	of	the	show	,	but	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	.
and	well	,	that	was	an	opera	experience	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	opera	house	that	wagner	built	for	 him 	 self 	 	.
and	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	room	is	not	that	big	.
it	's	 small 	 er 	 	than	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	wagner	made	an	 innov 	 ation 	 	.	he	 want 	 ed 	 	a	 big 	 ger 	 	band	.
he	 want 	 ed 	 	a	little	more	 bomb 	 ast 	 	,
so	he	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	orchestra	pit	so	he	could	get	more	low	-	end	 instrument 	 s 	 	in	there	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	carnegie	hall	.
 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	thing	 be 	 came 	 	popular	.
the	 hall 	 s 	 	got	 big 	 ger 	 	.	carnegie	hall	's	fair	-	sized	.
it	's	 large 	 r 	 	than	some	of	the	other	 sym 	 phony 	 	 hall 	 s 	 	.
and	they	're	a	lot	more	 reverbe 	 rant 	 	than	la	scala	.
around	the	same	,	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	alex	ross	who	 write 	 s 	 	for	the	new	yorker	,	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	rule	came	 in 	 to 	 	effect	that	 audience 	 s 	 	had	to	be	quiet	--
no	more	eating	,	 drink 	 ing 	 	and	 yell 	 ing 	 	at	the	stage	,	or	 gossip 	 ing 	 	with	one	 an 	 other 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	show	.
they	had	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	quiet	.
so	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 thing 	 s 	 	 combine 	 d 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	that	a	different	kind	of	music	 work 	 ed 	 	best	in	these	kind	of	 hall 	 s 	 	.
it	 me 	 ant 	 	that	there	could	be	 extrem 	 e 	 	 dynamic 	 s 	 	,	which	there	 we 	 re 	 	n't	in	some	of	these	other	 kind 	 s 	 	of	music	.
quiet	 part 	 s 	 	could	be	heard	that	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	 drown 	 ed 	 	out	by	all	the	 gossip 	 ing 	 	and	 shout 	 ing 	 	.
but	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 reverbe 	 ration 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	rooms	like	carnegie	hall	,	the	music	had	to	be	 may 	 be 	 	a	little	less	 rhythm 	 ic 	 	and	a	little	more	 text 	 ural 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	mahler	.
it	 look 	 s 	 	like	bob	dylan	,	but	it	's	mahler	.
that	was	bob	's	last	record	,	 yea 	 h 	 	.
popular	music	,	coming	 a 	 long 	 	at	the	same	time	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	jazz	band	.
 accord 	 ing 	 	to	scott	joplin	,	the	 band 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	on	 river 	 boat 	 s 	 	and	 club 	 s 	 	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	it	's	noisy	.	they	're	 play 	 ing 	 	for	 danc 	 ers 	 	.
there	's	certain	 section 	 s 	 	of	the	song	--	the	 song 	 s 	 	had	different	 section 	 s 	 	that	the	 danc 	 ers 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 like 	 d 	 	.	and	they	'd	say	,	``	play	that	part	 aga 	 in 	 	.	``
well	,	there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	so	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	you	can	play	the	same	section	of	a	song	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	for	the	 danc 	 ers 	 	.
so	the	 band 	 s 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	to	 improv 	 ise 	 	new	 melo 	 dies 	 	.
and	a	new	form	of	music	was	born	.
these	are	 play 	 ed 	 	 main 	 ly 	 	in	small	rooms	.
people	are	 danc 	 ing 	 	,	 shout 	 ing 	 	and	 drink 	 ing 	 	.
so	the	music	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	loud	 en 	 ough 	 	to	be	heard	above	that	.
same	thing	 go 	 es 	 	true	for	--	that	's	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	century	--	for	the	whole	of	20th	-	century	popular	music	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	rock	or	latin	music	or	 what 	 ever 	 	.
[	live	music	]	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	change	that	much	.
it	 change 	 s 	 	about	a	third	of	the	way	 in 	 to 	 	the	20th	century	,	when	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 came 	 	one	of	the	 prim 	 ary 	 	 venue 	 s 	 	for	music	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	one	way	that	the	music	got	there	.
 micro 	 phone 	 s 	 	enabled	 s 	 ing 	 ers 	 	,	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	and	 music 	 ians 	 	and	 compose 	 rs 	 	,	to	 complete 	 ly 	 	change	the	kind	of	music	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	writing	.
so	far	,	a	lot	of	the	stuff	that	was	on	the	radio	was	live	music	,	but	 s 	 ing 	 ers 	 	,	like	frank	sinatra	,	could	use	the	mic	and	do	 thing 	 s 	 	that	they	could	never	do	 with 	 out 	 	a	 micro 	 phone 	 	.
other	 s 	 ing 	 ers 	 	after	him	went	even	further	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	chet	 bake 	 r 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	thing	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	 with 	 out 	 	a	 micro 	 phone 	 	.
it	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 record 	 ed 	 	music	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
and	he	's	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	right	 in 	 to 	 	your	ear	.
he	's	 whisper 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	your	 ear 	 s 	 	.
the	effect	is	just	electric	.
it	's	like	the	guy	is	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	next	to	you	,	 whisper 	 ing 	 	who	 know 	 s 	 	what	 in 	 to 	 	your	ear	.
so	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	music	 diverge 	 d 	 	.
there	's	live	music	,	and	there	's	 record 	 ed 	 	music	.
and	they	no	 long 	 er 	 	have	to	be	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	.
now	there	's	 venue 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	a	 dis 	 co 	 the 	 que 	 	,	and	there	's	 ju 	 ke 	 boxes 	 	in	 bar 	 s 	 	,	where	you	do	n't	even	need	to	have	a	band	.
there	 do 	 es 	 	n't	need	to	be	any	live	 perform 	 ing 	 	 music 	 ians 	 	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	,
and	the	sound	 system 	 s 	 	are	good	.
people	 beg 	 an 	 	to	make	music	 specific 	 ally 	 	for	 dis 	 co 	 s 	 	and	for	 t 	 hose 	 	sound	 system 	 s 	 	.
and	,	 a 	 s 	 	with	jazz	,	the	 danc 	 ers 	 	 like 	 d 	 	certain	 section 	 s 	 	more	than	they	did	 other 	 s 	 	.
so	the	early	hip	-	hop	 guy 	 s 	 	would	loop	certain	 section 	 s 	 	.
the	mc	would	 improv 	 ise 	 	 lyric 	 s 	 	in	the	same	way	that	the	jazz	 player 	 s 	 	would	 improv 	 ise 	 	 melo 	 dies 	 	.
and	 an 	 other 	 	new	form	of	music	was	born	.
live	performance	,	when	it	was	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	,	 end 	 ed 	 	up	in	what	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	,	 acoustic 	 ally 	 	,	the	worst	 sound 	 ing 	 	 venue 	 s 	 	on	the	planet	:	 s 	 port 	 s 	 	 stad 	 ium 	 s 	 	,	 basket 	 ball 	 	 arena 	 s 	 	and	 hoc 	 key 	 	 arena 	 s 	 	.
 music 	 ians 	 	who	 end 	 ed 	 	up	there	did	the	best	they	could	.
they	wrote	what	is	now	 call 	 ed 	 	arena	rock	,	which	is	medium	-	speed	 ball 	 ad 	 s 	 	.
they	did	the	best	they	could	 give 	 n 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	they	're	writing	for	.
the	 tempo 	 s 	 	are	medium	.	it	 sound 	 s 	 	big	.
it	's	more	a	social	 situ 	 ation 	 	than	a	musical	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
and	in	some	ways	,	the	music	that	they	're	writing	for	 th 	 is 	 	place	 work 	 s 	 	 perfect 	 ly 	 	.
so	there	's	more	new	 venue 	 s 	 	.
one	of	the	new	 one 	 s 	 	is	the	 auto 	 mobile 	 	.
i	grew	up	with	a	radio	in	a	car	.
but	now	that	's	 evolv 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
the	car	is	a	whole	venue	.
the	music	that	,	i	would	say	,	is	written	for	 auto 	 mobile 	 	sound	 system 	 s 	 	 work 	 s 	 	 perfect 	 ly 	 	on	it	.
it	might	not	be	what	you	want	to	listen	to	at	home	,	but	it	 work 	 s 	 	great	in	the	car	--	 ha 	 s 	 	a	huge	frequency	spectrum	,	you	know	,	big	 bas 	 s 	 	and	high	-	end	and	the	voice	kind	of	 s 	 tuck 	 	in	the	middle	.
 auto 	 mobile 	 	music	,	you	can	share	with	your	 friend 	 s 	 	.
there	's	one	other	kind	of	new	venue	,	the	private	mp	3	player	.
 pre 	 sum 	 ably 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	for	christian	music	.
and	in	some	ways	it	's	like	carnegie	hall	,	or	when	the	audience	had	to	hush	up	,
 be 	 cause 	 	you	can	now	hear	every	single	detail	.
in	other	ways	,	it	's	more	like	the	west	african	music	 be 	 cause 	 	if	the	music	in	an	mp	3	player	 get 	 s 	 	too	quiet	,	you	turn	it	up	,	and	the	next	minute	,	your	 ear 	 s 	 	are	 blast 	 ed 	 	out	by	a	 loud 	 er 	 	 pass 	 age 	 	.
so	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	work	.
i	think	pop	music	,	 main 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	written	 to 	 day 	 	,	to	some	 ex 	 tent 	 	,	is	written	for	these	kind	of	 player 	 s 	 	,	for	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	personal	experience	where	you	can	hear	 extrem 	 e 	 	detail	,	but	the	dynamic	 do 	 es 	 	n't	change	that	much	.
so	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	 my 	 self 	 	:	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	is	 th 	 is 	 	a	model	for	creation	,	 th 	 is 	 	 adapt 	 ation 	 	that	we	do	?
and	 do 	 es 	 	it	happen	 any 	 where 	 	else	?
well	,	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	david	attenborough	and	some	other	people	,	 bird 	 s 	 	do	it	too	--
that	the	 bird 	 s 	 	in	the	 can 	 opy 	 	,	where	the	 folia 	 ge 	 	is	dense	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 call 	 s 	 	tend	to	be	high	-	 pitch 	 ed 	 	,	short	and	 repetit 	 ive 	 	.
and	the	 bird 	 s 	 	on	the	floor	tend	to	have	lower	 pitch 	 ed 	 	 call 	 s 	 	,	so	that	they	do	n't	get	 distort 	 ed 	 	when	they	 bounc 	 e 	 	off	the	forest	floor	.
and	 bird 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	 savanna 	 h 	 	 sp 	 arrow 	 	,	they	tend	to	have	a	 buzz 	 ing 	 	type	call	.
and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	a	sound	like	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	most	energy	efficient	and	practical	way	to	transmit	 the 	 ir 	 	call	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 field 	 s 	 	and	 savanna 	 h 	 s 	 	.
other	 bird 	 s 	 	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	 tana 	 ger 	 	,	have	 adapt 	 ed 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	same	species	.
the	 tan 	 anger 	 	on	the	east	coast	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	where	the	 forest 	 s 	 	are	a	little	 den 	 s 	 er 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	one	kind	of	call	,	and	the	 tan 	 anger 	 	on	the	other	side	,	on	the	west	 ha 	 s 	 	a	different	kind	of	call	.
so	 bird 	 s 	 	do	it	too	.
and	i	thought	:	well	,	if	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	model	for	creation	,	if	we	make	music	,	 prim 	 arily 	 	the	form	at	 l 	 east 	 	,	to	fit	these	 con 	 text 	 s 	 	,	and	if	we	make	art	to	fit	 gall 	 ery 	 	 wall 	 s 	 	or	museum	 wall 	 s 	 	,	and	if	we	write	 soft 	 ware 	 	to	fit	 exist 	 ing 	 	 oper 	 ating 	 	 system 	 s 	 	,	is	that	how	it	 work 	 s 	 	?
 yea 	 h 	 	.	i	think	it	's	 evolution 	 ary 	 	.
it	's	 adapt 	 ive 	 	.
but	the	pleasure	and	the	 pass 	 ion 	 	and	the	joy	is	still	there	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	reverse	view	of	 thing 	 s 	 	from	the	kind	of	 tradition 	 al 	 	romantic	view	.
the	romantic	view	is	that	first	 come 	 s 	 	the	 pass 	 ion 	 	and	then	the	 out 	 pour 	 ing 	 	of	emotion	,	and	then	 some 	 how 	 	it	 get 	 s 	 	shaped	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	.
and	i	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	,	well	,	the	 pass 	 ion 	 	's	still	there	,	but	the	vessel	that	it	's	going	to	be	 inject 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	and	 pour 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	,	that	is	 instinct 	 ively 	 	and	 intuitive 	 ly 	 	 create 	 d 	 	first	.
we	 al 	 ready 	 	know	where	that	 pass 	 ion 	 	is	going	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	conflict	of	 view 	 s 	 	is	kind	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
the	writer	,	thomas	frank	,	 say 	 s 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	might	be	a	kind	of	 explan 	 ation 	 	why	some	 vot 	 ers 	 	vote	against	 the 	 ir 	 	best	 interest 	 s 	 	,	that	 vot 	 ers 	 	,	like	a	lot	of	us	,	 assum 	 e 	 	,	that	if	they	hear	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 sound 	 s 	 	like	it	's	 since 	 re 	 	,	that	it	's	coming	from	the	gut	,	that	it	's	passionate	,	that	it	's	more	authentic	.
and	they	'll	vote	for	that	.
so	that	,	if	 some 	 body 	 	can	fake	 since 	 r 	 ity 	 	,	if	they	can	fake	 pass 	 ion 	 	,	they	stand	a	better	chance	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 select 	 ed 	 	in	that	way	,	which	 seem 	 s 	 	a	little	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
i	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	the	two	,	the	 pass 	 ion 	 	,	the	joy	,	are	not	 mutual 	 ly 	 	exclusive	.
 may 	 be 	 	what	the	world	 need 	 s 	 	now	is	for	us	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	we	are	like	the	 bird 	 s 	 	.
we	adapt	.
we	 s 	 ing 	 	.
and	like	the	 bird 	 s 	 	,	the	joy	is	still	there	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	we	have	 change 	 d 	 	what	we	do	to	fit	the	 con 	 text 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
