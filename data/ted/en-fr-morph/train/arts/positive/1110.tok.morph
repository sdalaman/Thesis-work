i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	a	rock	star	.
i	 dream 	 ed 	 	of	it	,	and	that	's	all	i	 dream 	 ed 	 	of	.
to	be	more	accurate	,	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	a	pop	star	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	in	the	late	'80s	.
and	 most 	 ly 	 	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	the	fifth	member	of	depeche	mode	or	duran	duran	.
they	would	n't	have	me	.
i	did	n't	read	music	,	but	i	 play 	 ed 	 	 synthesize 	 rs 	 	and	drum	 machine 	 s 	 	.
and	i	grew	up	in	 th 	 is 	 	little	 farm 	 ing 	 	town	in	 north 	 ern 	 	nevada	.
and	i	was	certain	that	's	what	my	life	would	be	.
and	when	i	went	to	college	at	the	university	of	nevada	,	las	vegas	when	i	was	18	,	i	was	 stunn 	 ed 	 	to	find	that	there	was	not	a	pop	star	101	,	or	even	a	degree	program	for	that	interest	.
and	the	choir	conductor	there	 k 	 new 	 	that	i	 s 	 ang 	 	and	 invit 	 ed 	 	me	to	come	and	join	the	choir	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	i	would	love	to	do	that	.	it	 sound 	 s 	 	great	.	``
and	i	left	the	room	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	way	.	``
the	choir	people	in	my	high	school	 we 	 re 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	 geek 	 y 	 	,	and	there	was	no	way	i	was	going	to	have	 any 	 thing 	 	to	do	with	 t 	 hose 	 	people	.
and	about	a	week	 lat 	 er 	 	,	a	friend	of	mine	came	to	me	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	listen	,	you	've	got	to	join	choir	.
at	the	end	of	the	semester	,	we	're	taking	a	trip	to	mexico	,	all	 expense 	 s 	 	paid	.
and	the	soprano	section	is	just	full	of	hot	 girl 	 s 	 	.	``
and	so	i	 figur 	 ed 	 	for	mexico	and	 bab 	 es 	 	,	i	could	do	just	about	 any 	 thing 	 	.
and	i	went	to	my	first	day	in	choir	,	and	i	 s 	 at 	 	down	with	the	 bas 	 s 	 es 	 	and	sort	of	 look 	 ed 	 	over	my	shoulder	to	see	what	they	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	.
they	 open 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 score 	 s 	 	,	the	conductor	 g 	 ave 	 	the	 down 	 beat 	 	,	and	boom	,	they	 launch 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	kyrie	from	the	``	requiem	``	by	mozart	.
in	my	entire	life	i	had	 s 	 een 	 	in	black	and	white	,	and	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	was	in	 shock 	 ing 	 	technicolor	.
the	most	 transform 	 ative 	 	experience	i	've	ever	had	--	in	that	single	moment	,	 hear 	 ing 	 	dissonance	and	 harmon 	 y 	 	and	people	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	,	people	together	,	the	 share 	 d 	 	vision	.
and	i	felt	for	the	first	time	in	my	life	that	i	was	part	of	 some 	 thing 	 	 big 	 ger 	 	than	 my 	 self 	 	.
and	there	 we 	 re 	 	a	lot	of	cute	 girl 	 s 	 	in	the	soprano	section	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	.
i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	write	a	piece	for	choir	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	gift	to	 th 	 is 	 	conductor	who	had	 change 	 d 	 	my	life	.
i	had	 learn 	 ed 	 	to	read	music	by	then	,	or	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	to	read	music	.
and	that	piece	was	 publish 	 ed 	 	,	and	then	i	wrote	 an 	 other 	 	piece	,	and	that	got	 publish 	 ed 	 	.
and	then	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 conduct 	 ing 	 	,	and	i	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 do 	 ing 	 	my	master	's	degree	at	the	juilliard	school	.
and	i	find	 my 	 self 	 	now	in	the	 un 	 like 	 ly 	 	position	of	 stand 	 ing 	 	in	front	of	all	of	you	 a 	 s 	 	a	professional	 classic 	 al 	 	 compose 	 r 	 	and	conductor	.
well	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	a	friend	of	mine	 email 	 ed 	 	me	a	link	,	a	youtube	link	,	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	have	got	to	see	 th 	 is 	 	.	``
and	it	was	 th 	 is 	 	young	woman	who	had	 post 	 ed 	 	a	fan	video	to	me	,	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	the	soprano	line	to	a	piece	of	mine	 call 	 ed 	 	``	sleep	.	``
britlin	losee	:	hi	mr.	eric	whitacre	.
my	name	is	britlin	losee	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	video	that	i	'd	like	to	make	for	you	.
here	's	me	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	``	sleep	.	``
i	'm	a	little	nervous	,	just	to	let	you	know	.
♫	if	there	are	 noise 	 s 	 	♫	♫	in	the	night	♫	eric	whitacre	:	i	was	 thunder 	 s 	 truck 	 	.
britlin	was	so	 innoc 	 ent 	 	and	so	sweet	,	and	her	voice	was	so	 pur 	 e 	 	.
and	i	even	 love 	 d 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	her	;
i	could	see	the	little	 ted 	 dy 	 	bear	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	on	the	piano	 be 	 hind 	 	her	in	her	room	.
 s 	 uch 	 	an	 intima 	 te 	 	video	.
and	i	had	 th 	 is 	 	idea	:	if	i	could	get	50	people	to	all	do	 th 	 is 	 	same	thing	,	 s 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 part 	 s 	 	--	soprano	,	 al 	 to 	 	,	 ten 	 or 	 	and	 bas 	 s 	 	--	 where 	 ver 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	in	the	world	,	post	 the 	 ir 	 	 video 	 s 	 	to	youtube	,	we	could	cut	it	all	together	and	create	a	virtual	choir	.
so	i	wrote	on	my	blog	,	``	omg	omg	.	``
i	 actual 	 ly 	 	wrote	,	``	omg	,	``	 hope 	 fully 	 	for	the	last	time	in	public	ever	.
and	i	 s 	 ent 	 	out	 th 	 is 	 	call	to	 s 	 ing 	 ers 	 	.
and	i	made	free	the	download	of	the	music	to	a	piece	that	i	had	written	in	the	year	2000	 call 	 ed 	 	``	lux	aurumque	,	``	which	 mean 	 s 	 	``	light	and	gold	.	``
and	lo	and	 be 	 hold 	 	,	people	 start 	 ed 	 	 upload 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 video 	 s 	 	.
now	i	should	say	,	before	that	,	what	i	did	is	i	 post 	 ed 	 	a	conductor	track	of	 my 	 self 	 	 conduct 	 ing 	 	.
and	it	's	in	complete	silence	when	i	 film 	 ed 	 	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	 on 	 ly 	 	 hear 	 ing 	 	the	music	in	my	head	,	 imagin 	 ing 	 	the	choir	that	would	one	day	come	to	be	.
 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	i	 play 	 ed 	 	a	piano	track	 under 	 neath 	 	so	that	the	 s 	 ing 	 ers 	 	would	have	 some 	 thing 	 	to	listen	to	.
and	then	 a 	 s 	 	the	 video 	 s 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	to	come	in	...
 th 	 is 	 	is	cheryl	ang	from	singapore	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	evangelina	etienne	from	massachusetts	.
stephen	hanson	from	sweden	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	jamal	 walk 	 er 	 	from	dallas	,	texas	.
there	was	even	a	little	soprano	 s 	 olo 	 	in	the	piece	,	and	so	i	had	 audition 	 s 	 	.
and	a	number	of	 soprano 	 s 	 	 upload 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 part 	 s 	 	.
i	was	told	 lat 	 er 	 	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	by	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 s 	 ing 	 ers 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	,	that	they	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 record 	 ed 	 	50	or	60	different	 take 	 s 	 	 un 	 til 	 	they	got	just	the	right	take	--	they	 upload 	 ed 	 	it	.
here	's	our	winner	of	the	soprano	 s 	 olo 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 melo 	 dy 	 	myers	from	tennessee	.
i	love	the	little	 s 	 mile 	 	she	 do 	 es 	 	right	over	the	top	of	the	note	--	like	,	``	no	problem	,	 every 	 thing 	 	's	fine	.	``
and	from	the	crowd	 emerge 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	young	man	,	scott	haines	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	listen	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	project	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	looking	for	my	whole	life	.
i	'd	like	to	be	the	person	to	edit	 th 	 is 	 	all	together	.	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	thank	you	,	scott	.	i	'm	so	glad	that	you	found	me	.	``
and	scott	 aggreg 	 ated 	 	all	of	the	 video 	 s 	 	.
he	 scrub 	 bed 	 	the	audio	.
he	made	 s 	 ure 	 	that	 every 	 thing 	 	lined	up	.
and	then	we	 post 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	video	to	youtube	about	a	year	and	a	half	ago	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	``	lux	aurumque	``	 s 	 ung 	 	by	the	virtual	choir	.
i	'll	stop	it	there	in	the	interest	of	time	.
thank	you	.	thank	you	.
thank	you	.
so	there	's	more	.	there	's	more	.
thank	you	so	much	.
and	i	had	the	same	 re 	 action 	 	you	did	.
i	 actual 	 ly 	 	was	 move 	 d 	 	to	 tear 	 s 	 	when	i	first	saw	it	.
i	just	could	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	the	 poet 	 ry 	 	of	all	of	it	--	these	 soul 	 s 	 	all	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	desert	 is 	 land 	 	,	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	 electron 	 ic 	 	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	in	 bottle 	 s 	 	to	each	other	.
and	the	video	went	viral	.
we	had	a	million	 hit 	 s 	 	in	the	first	month	and	got	a	lot	of	attention	for	it	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	of	that	,	then	a	lot	of	 s 	 ing 	 ers 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	all	right	,	what	's	virtual	choir	2.0	?	``
and	so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	for	virtual	choir	2.0	that	i	would	 choos 	 e 	 	the	same	piece	that	britlin	was	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	,	``	sleep	,	``	which	is	 an 	 other 	 	work	that	i	wrote	in	the	year	2000	--	 poet 	 ry 	 	by	my	dear	friend	charles	anthony	silvestri	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	i	 post 	 ed 	 	a	conductor	video	,	and	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 accept 	 ing 	 	 sub 	 mission 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	time	we	got	some	more	mature	 member 	 s 	 	.
and	some	 young 	 er 	 	 member 	 s 	 	.
soprano	:	♫	 up 	 on 	 	my	 pil 	 low 	 	♫	♫	safe	in	bed	♫	ew	:	that	's	georgie	from	england	.	she	's	 on 	 ly 	 	nine	.
is	n't	that	the	 sweet 	 est 	 	thing	you	've	ever	 s 	 een 	 	?
 some 	 one 	 	did	all	eight	 video 	 s 	 	--	a	 bas 	 s 	 	even	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	the	soprano	 part 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	beau	awtin	.
beau	awtin	:	♫	safe	in	bed	♫	ew	:	and	our	goal	--	it	was	sort	of	an	 arbitr 	 ary 	 	goal	--	there	was	an	mtv	video	where	they	all	 s 	 ang 	 	``	lollipop	``	and	they	got	people	from	all	over	the	world	to	just	 s 	 ing 	 	that	little	 melo 	 dy 	 	.
and	there	 we 	 re 	 	900	people	 involve 	 d 	 	in	that	.
so	i	told	the	 s 	 ing 	 ers 	 	,	``	that	's	our	goal	.
that	's	the	number	for	us	to	beat	.	``
and	we	just	closed	 sub 	 mission 	 s 	 	january	10th	,	and	our	final	 t 	 ally 	 	was	2,051	 video 	 s 	 	from	58	different	 count 	 ries 	 	.
thank	you	.
from	malta	,	madagascar	,	thailand	,	vietnam	,	jordan	,	egypt	,	israel	,	 a 	 s 	 	far	north	 a 	 s 	 	alaska	and	 a 	 s 	 	far	south	 a 	 s 	 	new	zealand	.
and	we	 al 	 so 	 	put	a	page	on	facebook	for	the	 s 	 ing 	 ers 	 	to	upload	 the 	 ir 	 	 testimonial 	 s 	 	,	what	it	was	like	for	them	,	 the 	 ir 	 	experience	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	it	.
and	i	've	just	 chose 	 n 	 	a	few	of	them	here	.
``	my	sister	and	i	used	to	 s 	 ing 	 	in	 choir 	 s 	 	together	 constant 	 ly 	 	.
now	she	's	an	 air 	 man 	 	in	the	air	force	 constant 	 ly 	 	 travel 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	so	 wonder 	 ful 	 	to	 s 	 ing 	 	together	 aga 	 in 	 	!	``
i	love	the	idea	that	she	's	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	with	her	sister	.
``	 a 	 side 	 	from	the	 beaut 	 iful 	 	music	,	it	's	great	just	to	know	i	'm	part	of	a	 world 	 wide 	 	community	of	people	i	never	met	before	,	but	who	are	 connect 	 ed 	 	 any 	 way 	 	.	``
and	my	personal	 favor 	 ite 	 	,	``	when	i	told	my	husband	that	i	was	going	to	be	a	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	he	told	me	that	i	did	not	have	the	voice	for	it	.	``
 yea 	 h 	 	,	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	a	lot	of	you	have	heard	that	too	.
me	too	.
``	it	hurt	so	much	,	and	i	shed	some	 tear 	 s 	 	,	but	 some 	 thing 	 	 in 	 side 	 	of	me	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 spite 	 	his	 word 	 s 	 	.
it	is	a	dream	come	true	to	be	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	choir	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	've	never	 be 	 en 	 	part	of	one	.
when	i	 place 	 d 	 	a	marker	on	the	google	earth	map	,	i	had	to	go	with	the	 near 	 est 	 	city	,	which	is	about	400	 mile 	 s 	 	away	from	where	i	live	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	am	in	the	great	alaskan	bush	,	satellite	is	my	 connect 	 ion 	 	to	the	world	.	``
so	two	 thing 	 s 	 	 s 	 truck 	 	me	 deep 	 ly 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
the	first	is	that	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	will	go	to	any	 length 	 s 	 	 necess 	 ary 	 	to	find	and	connect	with	each	other	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	the	technology	.
and	the	second	is	that	people	seem	to	be	 ex 	 peri 	 encing 	 	an	actual	 connect 	 ion 	 	.
it	was	n't	a	virtual	choir	.
there	are	people	now	 on 	 line 	 	that	are	 friend 	 s 	 	;	they	've	never	met	.
but	,	i	know	 my 	 self 	 	too	,	i	feel	 th 	 is 	 	virtual	 es 	 pri 	 t 	 	de	 corp 	 s 	 	,	if	you	will	,	with	all	of	them	.
i	feel	a	 close 	 ness 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	choir	--	 al 	 most 	 	like	a	family	.
what	i	'd	like	to	close	with	then	 to 	 day 	 	is	the	first	look	at	``	sleep	``	by	virtual	choir	2.0	.
 th 	 is 	 	will	be	a	premiere	 to 	 day 	 	.
we	're	not	 finish 	 ed 	 	with	the	video	yet	.
you	can	imagine	,	with	2,000	 synchron 	 ized 	 	youtube	 video 	 s 	 	,	the	render	time	is	just	 atro 	 c 	 ious 	 	.
