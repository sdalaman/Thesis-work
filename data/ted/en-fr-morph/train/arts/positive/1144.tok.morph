my	name	is	amit	.
and	18	 month 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	had	 an 	 other 	 	job	at	google	,	and	i	 pitch 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	with	 museum 	 s 	 	and	art	to	my	 bo 	 s 	 s 	 	who	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	here	,	and	she	 allow 	 ed 	 	me	to	do	it	.
and	it	took	18	 month 	 s 	 	.
a	lot	of	 f 	 un 	 	,	 negoti 	 ations 	 	and	 st 	 ories 	 	,	i	can	tell	you	,	with	17	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 museum 	 s 	 	from	nine	 count 	 ries 	 	.
but	i	'm	going	to	focus	on	the	demo	.
there	are	a	lot	of	 st 	 ories 	 	about	why	we	did	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	think	my	personal	story	is	 explain 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	on	the	slide	,	and	it	's	access	.
and	i	grew	up	in	india	.
i	had	a	great	education	--	i	'm	not	 complain 	 ing 	 	--	but	i	did	n't	have	access	to	a	lot	of	these	 museum 	 s 	 	and	these	 art 	 work 	 s 	 	.
and	so	when	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 travel 	 ing 	 	and	going	to	these	 museum 	 s 	 	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	a	lot	.
and	while	 work 	 ing 	 	at	google	,	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	put	 th 	 is 	 	 desir 	 e 	 	to	make	it	more	 access 	 ible 	 	with	technology	together	.
so	we	 form 	 ed 	 	a	team	,	a	great	team	of	people	,	and	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	 prob 	 ably 	 	get	 in 	 to 	 	the	demo	and	then	tell	you	a	couple	of	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	we	've	had	since	launch	.
so	,	simple	:	you	come	to	_UNK_	.
you	look	around	at	all	these	 museum 	 s 	 	here	.
you	've	got	the	uffizi	,	you	've	got	the	moma	,	the	 hermit 	 age 	 	,	the	_UNK_	,	the	van	gogh	.
i	'm	going	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	to	one	of	my	 favor 	 ites 	 	,	the	 metro 	 politan 	 	museum	of	art	in	new	york	.
two	ways	of	going	in	--	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	.
click	and	,	bang	,	you	're	in	 th 	 is 	 	museum	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	where	you	are	--	bombay	,	mexico	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	matter	.
you	move	around	,	you	have	 f 	 un 	 	.
you	want	to	 navig 	 ate 	 	around	the	museum	?
open	the	plan	up	,	and	,	in	one	click	,	jump	.
you	're	in	there	,	you	want	to	go	to	the	end	of	the	corridor	.
keep	going	.	have	 f 	 un 	 	.
explore	.
 thank 	 s 	 	.	i	have	n't	come	to	the	best	part	.
so	now	i	'm	in	front	of	one	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	``	the	_UNK_	``	by	pieter	bruegel	at	the	met	.
i	see	 th 	 is 	 	plus	sign	.
if	the	museum	 ha 	 s 	 	 give 	 n 	 	us	the	image	,	you	click	on	it	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	 image 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	of	the	meta	-	data	information	.
for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	are	 tru 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	art	,	you	can	click	 th 	 is 	 	--	but	i	'm	going	to	click	 th 	 is 	 	off	right	now	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	these	 image 	 s 	 	that	we	 capture 	 d 	 	in	what	we	call	_UNK_	technology	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	image	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	close	to	,	i	think	,	around	10	billion	 pixel 	 s 	 	.
and	i	get	a	lot	of	people	 ask 	 ing 	 	me	:	``	what	do	you	get	for	10	billion	 pixel 	 s 	 	?	``	so	i	'm	going	to	try	and	show	you	what	you	 re 	 ally 	 	get	for	10	billion	 pixel 	 s 	 	.
you	can	zoom	around	 ver 	 y 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	.
you	see	some	 f 	 un 	 	stuff	 happen 	 ing 	 	here	.
i	love	 th 	 is 	 	guy	;	his	 express 	 ion 	 	is	 price 	 less 	 	.
but	then	you	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	go	deep	.
and	so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	around	,	and	i	found	 some 	 thing 	 	going	on	over	here	.
and	i	was	like	,	``	hold	on	.	that	 sound 	 s 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.	``	went	in	,	and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 not 	 ic 	 ing 	 	that	these	 kid 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 beat 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	.
i	did	a	little	research	,	spoke	to	a	couple	of	my	 contact 	 s 	 	at	the	met	,	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	found	out	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	game	 call 	 ed 	 	squall	,	which	 involve 	 s 	 	 beat 	 ing 	 	a	goose	with	a	stick	on	_UNK_	tuesday	.
and	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	it	was	 quit 	 e 	 	popular	.
i	do	n't	know	why	they	did	it	,	but	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	about	it	.
now	just	to	get	 re 	 ally 	 	deep	in	,	you	can	 re 	 ally 	 	get	to	the	 crack 	 s 	 	.
now	just	to	give	you	some	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	i	'm	going	to	zoom	out	so	you	 re 	 ally 	 	see	what	you	get	.
here	is	where	we	 we 	 re 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 paint 	 ing 	 	.
the	best	is	yet	to	come	--	so	in	a	second	.
so	now	let	's	just	 quick 	 ly 	 	jump	 in 	 to 	 	the	moma	,	 aga 	 in 	 	in	new	york	.
so	 an 	 other 	 	one	of	my	 favor 	 ites 	 	,	``	the	 star 	 ry 	 	night	.	``
now	the	 ex 	 ample 	 	i	 show 	 ed 	 	you	was	all	about	 find 	 ing 	 	 detail 	 s 	 	.
but	what	if	you	want	to	see	brush	 stroke 	 s 	 	?
and	what	if	you	want	to	see	how	van	gogh	 actual 	 ly 	 	 create 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 master 	 piece 	 	?
you	zoom	in	.	you	 re 	 ally 	 	go	in	.
i	'm	going	to	go	to	one	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 part 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 	,	and	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	going	to	get	to	the	 crack 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	``	the	 star 	 ry 	 	night	,	``	i	think	,	never	 s 	 een 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	before	.
i	'm	going	to	show	you	my	other	 favor 	 ite 	 	feature	.
there	's	a	lot	of	other	stuff	here	,	but	i	do	n't	have	time	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	real	cool	part	.	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	 collect 	 ions 	 	.
any	one	of	you	,	 any 	 body 	 	--	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	if	you	're	rich	,	if	you	're	poor	,	if	you	have	a	 f 	 ancy 	 	house	--	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	.
you	can	go	and	create	your	own	museum	 on 	 line 	 	--	create	your	own	 collect 	 ion 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	all	these	 image 	 s 	 	.
 ver 	 y 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	,	you	go	in	--	and	i	've	 create 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	 call 	 ed 	 	the	power	of	zoom	--	you	can	just	zoom	around	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	``	the	 ambassador 	 s 	 	,	``	based	in	the	national	 gall 	 ery 	 	.
you	can	 annot 	 ate 	 	the	stuff	,	 s 	 end 	 	it	to	your	 friend 	 s 	 	and	 re 	 ally 	 	get	a	conversation	going	about	what	you	're	 feel 	 ing 	 	when	you	go	through	these	 master 	 piece 	 s 	 	.
so	i	think	,	in	 con 	 clusion 	 	,	for	me	,	the	main	thing	is	that	all	the	 amaz 	 ing 	 	stuff	here	 do 	 es 	 	not	 re 	 ally 	 	come	from	google	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	,	in	my	opinion	,	even	come	from	the	 museum 	 s 	 	.
i	 prob 	 ably 	 	should	n't	say	that	.
it	 re 	 ally 	 	 come 	 s 	 	from	these	 artist 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	my	 hum 	 bling 	 	experience	in	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	mean	,	i	hope	in	 th 	 is 	 	digital	medium	that	we	do	justice	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 art 	 work 	 	and	represent	it	 proper 	 ly 	 	 on 	 line 	 	.
and	the	 big 	 gest 	 	question	i	get	 ask 	 ed 	 	 now 	 a 	 day 	 s 	 	is	,	``	did	you	do	 th 	 is 	 	to	replicate	the	experience	of	going	to	a	museum	?	``	and	the	answer	is	no	.
it	's	to	supplement	the	experience	.
and	that	's	it	.	thank	you	.
thank	you	.
