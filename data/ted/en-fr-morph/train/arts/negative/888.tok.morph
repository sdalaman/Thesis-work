[	sanskrit	]	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 o 	 de 	 	to	the	mother	goddess	,	that	most	of	us	in	india	learn	when	we	are	children	.
i	 learn 	 ed 	 	it	when	i	was	four	at	my	mother	's	knee	.
that	year	she	 introduc 	 ed 	 	me	to	dance	,
and	thus	 beg 	 an 	 	my	 try 	 st 	 	with	 classic 	 al 	 	dance	.
since	then	--	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	four	 decade 	 s 	 	now	--	i	've	trained	with	the	best	in	the	field	,	 perform 	 ed 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 glob 	 e 	 	,	taught	young	and	old	 a 	 like 	 	,	 create 	 d 	 	,	 collabor 	 ated 	 	,	 choreograph 	 ed 	 	,	and	wove	a	rich	 tape 	 stry 	 	of	 artist 	 ry 	 	,	 achiev 	 ement 	 	and	 a 	 ward 	 s 	 	.
the	 crown 	 ing 	 	 glor 	 y 	 	was	in	2007	,	when	i	 receiv 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	country	's	fourth	highest	 civil 	 ian 	 	 a 	 ward 	 	,	the	padma	shri	,	for	my	 con 	 trib 	 ution 	 	to	art	.
but	 noth 	 ing 	 	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	prepared	me	for	what	i	was	to	hear	on	the	first	of	july	2008	.
i	heard	the	word	``	 car 	 cinoma 	 	.	``
 y 	 es 	 	,	breast	cancer	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 at 	 	 dumb 	 s 	 truck 	 	in	my	doctor	's	 off 	 ice 	 	,	i	heard	other	 word 	 s 	 	:	``	cancer	,	``	``	stage	,	``	``	grade	.	``
 un 	 til 	 	then	,	cancer	was	the	zodiac	sign	of	my	friend	,	stage	was	what	i	 perform 	 ed 	 	on	,	and	 grade 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	what	i	got	in	school	.
that	day	,	i	 real 	 ized 	 	i	had	an	 un 	 welcome 	 	,	 un 	 invit 	 ed 	 	,	new	life	partner	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	 danc 	 er 	 	,	i	know	the	nine	 rasa 	 s 	 	or	the	navarasas	:	anger	,	 val 	 or 	 	,	disgust	,	humor	and	fear	.
i	thought	i	 k 	 new 	 	what	fear	was	.
that	day	,	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	what	fear	was	.
 over 	 come 	 	with	the	 e 	 norm 	 ity 	 	of	it	all	and	the	complete	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	loss	of	control	,	i	shed	 cop 	 ious 	 	 tear 	 s 	 	and	 ask 	 ed 	 	my	dear	husband	,	jayant	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	is	 th 	 is 	 	it	?	is	 th 	 is 	 	the	end	of	the	road	?
is	 th 	 is 	 	the	end	of	my	dance	?	``
and	he	,	the	positive	soul	that	he	is	,	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	a	hiatus	,	a	hiatus	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	 treat 	 ment 	 	,	and	you	'll	get	back	to	 do 	 ing 	 	what	you	do	best	.	``
i	 real 	 ized 	 	then	that	i	,	who	thought	i	had	complete	control	of	my	life	,	had	control	of	 on 	 ly 	 	three	 thing 	 s 	 	:	my	thought	,	my	mind	--	the	 image 	 s 	 	that	these	 thought 	 s 	 	 create 	 d 	 	--	and	the	action	that	derived	from	it	.
so	here	i	was	 wall 	 ow 	 ing 	 	in	a	 vor 	 t 	 ex 	 	of	 emotion 	 s 	 	and	 depress 	 ion 	 	and	what	have	you	,	with	the	 e 	 norm 	 ity 	 	of	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	 want 	 ing 	 	to	go	to	a	place	of	 heal 	 ing 	 	,	health	and	happiness	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	go	from	where	i	was	to	where	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	,	for	which	i	 need 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	.
i	 need 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	would	pull	me	out	of	all	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	i	dried	my	 tear 	 s 	 	,	and	i	 declare 	 d 	 	to	the	world	at	large	...	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	cancer	's	 on 	 ly 	 	one	page	in	my	life	,	and	i	will	not	allow	 th 	 is 	 	page	to	impact	the	rest	of	my	life	.	``
i	 al 	 so 	 	 declare 	 d 	 	to	the	world	at	large	that	i	would	ride	it	out	,	and	i	would	not	allow	cancer	to	ride	me	.
but	to	go	from	where	i	was	to	where	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	,	i	 need 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	.
i	 need 	 ed 	 	an	anchor	,	an	image	,	a	peg	to	peg	 th 	 is 	 	process	on	,	so	that	i	could	go	from	there	.
and	i	found	that	in	my	dance	,	my	dance	,	my	strength	,	my	energy	,	my	 pass 	 ion 	 	,	my	 ver 	 y 	 	life	breath	.
but	it	was	n't	easy	.
 believ 	 e 	 	me	,	it	 definite 	 ly 	 	was	n't	easy	.
how	do	you	keep	cheer	when	you	go	from	 beaut 	 iful 	 	to	bald	in	three	 day 	 s 	 	?
how	do	you	not	despair	when	,	with	the	body	 ravage 	 d 	 	by	 chemo 	 therapy 	 	,	 climb 	 ing 	 	a	mere	flight	of	 stair 	 s 	 	was	 she 	 er 	 	torture	,	that	to	 some 	 one 	 	like	me	who	could	dance	for	three	 hour 	 s 	 	?
how	do	you	not	get	 overwhelm 	 ed 	 	by	the	despair	and	the	 mis 	 ery 	 	of	it	all	?
all	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	was	curl	up	and	weep	.
but	i	 ke 	 pt 	 	 tell 	 ing 	 	 my 	 self 	 	fear	and	 tear 	 s 	 	are	 option 	 s 	 	i	did	not	have	.
so	i	would	drag	 my 	 self 	 	 in 	 to 	 	my	dance	studio	--	body	,	mind	and	spirit	--	every	day	 in 	 to 	 	my	dance	studio	,	and	learn	 every 	 thing 	 	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	when	i	was	four	,	all	over	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 re 	 work 	 ed 	 	,	 re 	 learn 	 ed 	 	,	 re 	 group 	 ed 	 	.
it	was	 excruciat 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 pain 	 ful 	 	,	but	i	did	it	.
difficult	.
i	focused	on	my	 mudra 	 s 	 	,	on	the	 image 	 ry 	 	of	my	dance	,	on	the	 poet 	 ry 	 	and	the	metaphor	and	the	 philosoph 	 y 	 	of	the	dance	 it 	 self 	 	.
and	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	,	i	 move 	 d 	 	out	of	that	 mis 	 er 	 able 	 	state	of	mind	.
but	i	 need 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
i	 need 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	to	go	that	extra	mile	,
and	i	found	it	in	that	metaphor	which	i	had	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	my	mother	when	i	was	four	.
the	metaphor	of	mahishasura	mardhini	,	of	durga	.
durga	,	the	mother	goddess	,	the	 fear 	 less 	 	one	,	 create 	 d 	 	by	the	 pan 	 the 	 on 	 	of	hindu	 god 	 s 	 	.
durga	,	 resplen 	 dent 	 	,	 be 	 deck 	 ed 	 	,	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	her	18	 arm 	 s 	 	ready	for	 war 	 fare 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	she	 rod 	 e 	 	 ast 	 ride 	 	her	lion	 in 	 to 	 	the	 battle 	 field 	 	to	destroy	mahishasur	.
durga	,	the	 epit 	 ome 	 	of	creative	 femin 	 ine 	 	energy	,	or	 sha 	 k 	 ti 	 	.
durga	,	the	 fear 	 less 	 	one	.
i	made	that	image	of	durga	and	her	every	 attribut 	 e 	 	,	her	every	nuance	,	my	 ver 	 y 	 	own	.
powered	by	the	 symbol 	 ogy 	 	of	a	myth	and	the	 pass 	 ion 	 	of	my	training	,	i	 br 	 ought 	 	laser	-	sharp	focus	 in 	 to 	 	my	dance	,
laser	-	sharp	focus	to	 s 	 uch 	 	an	 ex 	 tent 	 	that	i	 danc 	 ed 	 	a	few	 week 	 s 	 	after	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	.
i	 danc 	 ed 	 	through	chemo	and	 radi 	 ation 	 	 cycle 	 s 	 	,	much	to	the	 dis 	 may 	 	of	my	 onco 	 logist 	 	.
i	 danc 	 ed 	 	between	chemo	and	 radi 	 ation 	 	 cycle 	 s 	 	and	 badge 	 red 	 	him	to	fit	it	to	my	 perform 	 ing 	 	dance	schedule	.
what	i	had	 d 	 one 	 	is	i	had	tuned	out	of	cancer	and	tuned	 in 	 to 	 	my	dance	.
