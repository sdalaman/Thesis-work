for	the	last	20	 year 	 s 	 	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 design 	 ing 	 	 puzzl 	 es 	 	.
and	i	'm	here	 to 	 day 	 	to	give	you	a	little	tour	,	 start 	 ing 	 	from	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	 puzzl 	 e 	 	i	designed	,	through	what	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	now	.
i	've	designed	 puzzl 	 es 	 	for	 book 	 s 	 	,	 print 	 ed 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	the	 puzzl 	 e 	 	 column 	 ist 	 	for	discover	magazine	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	that	for	about	10	 year 	 s 	 	.
i	have	a	 month 	 ly 	 	 puzzl 	 e 	 	calendar	.
i	do	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	.	the	bulk	of	my	work	is	in	computer	 game 	 s 	 	.
i	did	 puzzl 	 es 	 	for	``	bejeweled	.	``
i	did	n't	invent	``	bejeweled	.	``	i	ca	n't	take	credit	for	that	.
so	,	 ver 	 y 	 	first	 puzzl 	 e 	 	,	sixth	grade	,	my	teacher	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	oh	,	let	's	see	,	that	guy	,	he	 like 	 s 	 	to	make	stuff	.
i	'll	have	him	cut	out	 letter 	 s 	 	out	of	construction	paper	for	the	board	.	``
i	thought	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	great	 assign 	 ment 	 	.
and	so	here	is	what	i	came	up	with	.	i	start	 fiddl 	 ing 	 	with	it	.
i	came	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	letter	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	letter	of	the	 alpha 	 bet 	 	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	 fold 	 ed 	 	just	once	.
the	question	is	,	which	letter	is	it	if	i	 un 	 fold 	 	it	?
one	hint	:	it	's	not	``	l.	``
it	could	be	an	``	l	,	``	of	course	.
so	,	what	else	could	it	be	?
 yea 	 h 	 	,	a	lot	of	you	got	it	.
oh	 yea 	 h 	 	.	so	,	clever	thing	.
now	,	that	was	my	first	 puzzl 	 e 	 	.	i	got	 hook 	 ed 	 	.
i	 create 	 d 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	new	,	i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	,	you	know	,	i	'd	made	 cross 	 word 	 	 puzzl 	 es 	 	,	but	that	's	sort	of	like	 fill 	 ing 	 	in	 some 	 body 	 	else	's	 m 	 atrix 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	 some 	 thing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	original	.	i	got	 hook 	 ed 	 	.
i	read	martin	gardner	's	 column 	 s 	 	in	scientific	american	.
went	on	,	and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	to	devote	 my 	 self 	 	,	full	time	,	to	that	.
now	,	i	should	pause	and	say	,	what	do	i	mean	by	 puzzl 	 e 	 	?
a	 puzzl 	 e 	 	is	a	problem	that	is	 f 	 un 	 	to	solve	and	 ha 	 s 	 	a	right	answer	.
``	 f 	 un 	 	to	solve	,	``	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	 every 	 day 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	,	which	,	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	are	not	 ver 	 y 	 	well	-	designed	 puzzl 	 es 	 	.
you	know	,	they	might	have	a	solution	.	it	might	take	a	long	time	.	 no 	 body 	 	wrote	down	the	 rule 	 s 	 	 clear 	 ly 	 	.
who	designed	 th 	 is 	 	?
it	's	like	,	you	know	,	life	is	not	a	 ver 	 y 	 	well	-	written	story	so	we	have	to	hire	 writer 	 s 	 	to	make	 movie 	 s 	 	.
well	,	i	take	 every 	 day 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	,	and	i	make	 puzzl 	 es 	 	out	of	them	.
and	``	right	answer	,	``	of	course	there	might	be	more	than	one	right	answer	;	 man 	 y 	 	 puzzl 	 es 	 	have	more	than	one	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	a	couple	other	 form 	 s 	 	of	play	,	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	and	 game 	 s 	 	--	by	 to 	 y 	 	i	mean	,	 some 	 thing 	 	you	play	with	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	a	 part 	 icular 	 	goal	.
you	can	create	one	out	of	legos	.	you	know	,	you	can	do	 any 	 thing 	 	you	want	.
or	competitive	 game 	 s 	 	like	 ches 	 s 	 	where	,	well	,	you	're	not	 try 	 ing 	 	to	solve	...	you	can	make	a	 ches 	 s 	 	 puzzl 	 e 	 	,	but	the	goal	 re 	 ally 	 	is	to	beat	 an 	 other 	 	player	.
i	consider	that	 puzzl 	 es 	 	are	an	art	form	.
they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	ancient	.	it	 go 	 es 	 	back	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	there	is	written	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	form	,	like	a	joke	,	a	poem	,	a	magic	trick	or	a	song	,	 ver 	 y 	 	compact	form	.
at	worst	,	they	're	 throw 	 away 	 s 	 	,	they	're	for	 amuse 	 ment 	 	.
but	at	best	they	can	reach	for	 some 	 thing 	 	more	and	create	a	 memor 	 able 	 	impression	.
the	 progress 	 ion 	 	of	my	 care 	 er 	 	that	you	'll	see	is	looking	for	creating	 puzzl 	 es 	 	that	have	a	 memor 	 able 	 	impact	.
so	,	one	thing	i	found	early	on	,	when	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	computer	 game 	 s 	 	,	is	that	i	could	create	 puzzl 	 es 	 	that	will	alter	your	 per 	 ception 	 	.
i	'll	show	you	how	.	here	is	a	famous	one	.
so	,	it	's	two	 profile 	 s 	 	in	black	,	or	a	white	vase	in	the	middle	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	a	figure	-	ground	illusion	.
the	artist	m.c	.	escher	 exploit 	 ed 	 	that	in	some	of	his	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 print 	 s 	 	.	here	we	have	``	day	and	night	.	``
here	is	what	i	did	with	figure	and	ground	.
so	,	here	we	have	``	figure	``	in	black	.
here	we	have	``	figure	``	in	white	.
and	it	's	all	part	of	the	same	design	.
the	 back 	 ground 	 	to	one	is	the	other	.
 original 	 ly 	 	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	do	the	 word 	 s 	 	``	figure	``	and	``	ground	.	``
but	i	could	n't	do	that	,	i	 real 	 ized 	 	.	i	 change 	 d 	 	the	problem	.
it	's	all	``	figure	.	``
a	few	other	 thing 	 s 	 	.	here	is	my	name	.
and	that	 turn 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	title	of	my	first	book	,	``	inversions	.	``
these	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 design 	 s 	 	now	go	by	the	word	``	 ambi 	 gram 	 	.	``
i	'll	show	you	just	a	couple	 other 	 s 	 	.	here	we	have	the	 number 	 s 	 	one	through	10	,	the	 digit 	 s 	 	zero	through	nine	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
each	letter	here	is	one	of	these	 digit 	 s 	 	.
not	 strict 	 ly 	 	an	 ambi 	 gram 	 	in	the	 convention 	 al 	 	sense	.
i	like	 push 	 ing 	 	on	what	an	 ambi 	 gram 	 	can	mean	.
here	's	the	word	``	mirror	.	``	no	,	it	's	not	the	same	 up 	 side 	 	-	down	.	it	's	the	same	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
and	a	 marvel 	 ous 	 	fellow	from	the	media	lab	who	just	got	 ap 	 point 	 ed 	 	head	of	risd	,	is	john	maeda	.
and	so	i	did	 th 	 is 	 	for	him	.	it	's	sort	of	a	visual	 can 	 on 	 	.
and	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	in	magic	magazine	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	a	number	of	 ambi 	 gram 	 s 	 	on	 magic 	 ian 	 	's	 name 	 s 	 	.
so	here	we	have	penn	and	teller	,	same	 up 	 side 	 	-	down	.	 th 	 is 	 	 appear 	 s 	 	in	my	 puzzl 	 e 	 	calendar	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	let	's	go	back	to	the	 slide 	 s 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
now	,	 t 	 hose 	 	are	 f 	 un 	 	to	look	at	.
now	how	would	you	do	it	 interact 	 ively 	 	?
for	a	while	i	was	an	 inter 	 face 	 	 design 	 er 	 	.
and	so	i	think	a	lot	about	 interact 	 ion 	 	.
well	,	let	's	first	of	all	 simpl 	 ify 	 	the	 vase 	 s 	 	illusion	,
make	the	thing	on	the	right	.
now	,	if	you	could	pick	up	the	black	vase	,	it	would	look	like	the	figure	on	top	.
if	you	could	pick	up	the	white	area	,	it	would	look	like	the	figure	on	the	bottom	.
well	,	you	ca	n't	do	that	 physical 	 ly 	 	,
but	on	a	computer	you	can	do	it	.	let	's	 s 	 witch 	 	over	to	the	p.c	.
and	here	it	is	,	figure	-	ground	.
the	goal	here	is	to	take	the	 piece 	 s 	 	on	the	left	and	make	them	so	they	look	like	the	shape	on	the	right	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 follow 	 s 	 	the	 rule 	 s 	 	i	just	 s 	 aid 	 	:	any	black	area	that	is	 surround 	 ed 	 	by	white	can	be	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	.	but	that	is	 al 	 so 	 	true	of	any	white	area	.
so	,	here	we	got	the	white	area	in	the	middle	,	and	you	can	pick	it	up	.
i	'll	just	go	one	step	further	.
so	,	here	is	--	here	is	a	couple	 piece 	 s 	 	.	move	them	together	,	and	now	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	active	piece	.
you	can	 re 	 ally 	 	get	 in 	 side 	 	 some 	 body 	 	's	 per 	 ception 	 	and	have	them	experience	 some 	 thing 	 	.
it	's	like	the	old	maxim	of	``	you	can	tell	 some 	 body 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	and	show	them	,	but	if	they	do	it	they	 re 	 ally 	 	learn	it	.	``
here	is	 an 	 other 	 	thing	you	can	do	.
there	is	a	game	 call 	 ed 	 	rush	hour	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	true	 master 	 piece 	 s 	 	in	 puzzl 	 e 	 	design	 be 	 side 	 s 	 	rubik	's	cube	.
so	,	here	we	have	a	 crowd 	 ed 	 	 park 	 ing 	 	lot	with	 car 	 s 	 	all	over	the	place	.
the	goal	is	to	get	the	red	car	out	.	it	's	a	 slid 	 ing 	 	block	 puzzl 	 e 	 	.
it	's	made	by	the	company	think	 f 	 un 	 	.
it	's	 d 	 one 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.	i	love	 th 	 is 	 	 puzzl 	 e 	 	.
well	,	let	's	play	one	.	here	.	so	,	here	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 puzzl 	 e 	 	.
well	,	that	's	too	simple	,	let	's	add	 an 	 other 	 	piece	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	how	would	you	solve	 th 	 is 	 	one	?
well	,	move	the	blue	one	out	of	the	way	.
here	,	let	's	make	it	a	little	 hard 	 er 	 	.	still	 pre 	 tty 	 	easy	.
now	we	'll	make	it	 hard 	 er 	 	,	a	little	 hard 	 er 	 	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	one	is	a	little	bit	 trick 	 ier 	 	.	you	know	?	what	do	you	do	here	?
the	first	move	is	going	to	be	what	?
you	're	going	to	move	the	blue	one	up	in	order	to	get	the	 lav 	 end 	 er 	 	one	to	the	right	.
and	you	can	make	 puzzl 	 es 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	one	that	are	n't	 so 	 lv 	 able 	 	at	all	.
 t 	 hose 	 	four	are	 lock 	 ed 	 	in	a	 pin 	 wheel 	 	;	you	ca	n't	get	them	 a 	 part 	 	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	make	a	 s 	 equ 	 el 	 	.
i	did	n't	come	up	with	the	original	idea	.	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	way	i	work	 a 	 s 	 	an	inventor	is	to	create	a	 s 	 equ 	 el 	 	.
i	came	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 rail 	 road 	 	rush	hour	.
it	's	the	same	 bas 	 ic 	 	game	 ex 	 cept 	 	i	 introduc 	 ed 	 	a	new	piece	,	a	square	piece	that	can	move	both	 horizon 	 t 	 ally 	 	and	 vert 	 ically 	 	.
in	the	other	game	the	 car 	 s 	 	can	 on 	 ly 	 	move	forward	and	back	.
 create 	 d 	 	a	whole	bunch	of	 level 	 s 	 	for	it	.	now	i	'm	making	it	 avail 	 able 	 	to	 school 	 s 	 	.
and	it	 include 	 s 	 	 exercis 	 es 	 	that	show	you	not	just	how	to	solve	these	 puzzl 	 es 	 	,	but	how	to	 ex 	 tract 	 	the	 principle 	 s 	 	that	will	let	you	solve	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 puzzl 	 es 	 	or	 problem 	 s 	 	in	science	,	other	 area 	 s 	 	.
so	,	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	you	 learn 	 ing 	 	how	to	make	your	own	 puzzl 	 es 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	just	me	creating	them	.
garry	trudeau	 call 	 s 	 	 him 	 self 	 	an	 invest 	 ig 	 ative 	 	 cartoon 	 ist 	 	.
you	know	,	he	 do 	 es 	 	a	lot	of	research	before	he	 write 	 s 	 	a	cartoon	.
in	discover	magazine	,	i	'm	an	 invest 	 ig 	 ative 	 	 puzzl 	 e 	 	maker	.
i	got	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	gene	 s 	 equ 	 encing 	 	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	how	on	earth	can	you	come	up	with	a	sequence	of	the	base	 pair 	 s 	 	in	dna	?	``
cut	up	the	dna	,	you	sequence	individual	 piece 	 s 	 	,	and	then	you	look	for	 over 	 lap 	 s 	 	,
and	you	 bas 	 ically 	 	match	them	at	the	 edge 	 s 	 	.	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	kind	of	like	a	 jig 	 saw 	 	 puzzl 	 e 	 	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	the	 piece 	 s 	 	 over 	 lap 	 	.	``
so	,	here	is	what	i	 create 	 d 	 	for	discover	magazine	.
and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 so 	 lv 	 able 	 	in	a	magazine	.
you	know	,	you	ca	n't	cut	out	the	 piece 	 s 	 	and	move	them	around	.
so	,	here	is	the	nine	 piece 	 s 	 	.	and	you	're	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	put	them	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	grid	.
and	you	have	to	 choos 	 e 	 	 piece 	 s 	 	that	 over 	 lap 	 	on	the	edge	.
there	is	 on 	 ly 	 	one	solution	.	it	's	not	that	hard	.
but	it	 take 	 s 	 	some	 persist 	 ence 	 	.
and	when	you	're	 d 	 one 	 	,	it	 make 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	design	,	which	,	if	you	 s 	 quint 	 	,	is	the	word	``	 hel 	 ix 	 	.	``
so	,	that	's	the	form	of	the	 puzzl 	 e 	 	coming	out	of	the	content	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	the	other	way	around	.
here	is	a	couple	more	.	here	is	a	physics	-	based	 puzzl 	 e 	 	.
which	way	will	these	fall	?
one	of	these	 weigh 	 s 	 	50	 pound 	 s 	 	,	30	 pound 	 s 	 	and	10	 pound 	 s 	 	.
and	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	which	one	 weigh 	 s 	 	which	amount	,	they	'll	fall	different	 direction 	 s 	 	.
and	here	is	a	 puzzl 	 e 	 	based	on	color	 mix 	 ing 	 	.
i	 separat 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	image	 in 	 to 	 	cyan	,	magenta	,	yellow	,	black	,	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	 print 	 ing 	 	 color 	 s 	 	,	and	then	 mix 	 ed 	 	up	the	 separat 	 ions 	 	,	and	you	get	these	peculiar	 picture 	 s 	 	.
which	 separat 	 ions 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 mix 	 ed 	 	up	to	make	 t 	 hose 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	?
 get 	 s 	 	you	 think 	 ing 	 	about	color	.
 final 	 ly 	 	,	what	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	now	.	so	,	shufflebrain.com	,	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	you	can	go	visit	,	i	 join 	 ed 	 	up	with	my	wife	,	amy	-	jo	kim	.
she	could	 eas 	 ily 	 	be	up	here	giving	a	talk	about	her	work	.
so	,	we	're	making	smart	 game 	 s 	 	for	social	media	.
i	'll	explain	what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	.	we	're	looking	at	three	 trend 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	's	going	on	in	the	 game 	 s 	 	industry	right	now	.
first	of	all	,	you	know	,	for	a	long	time	computer	 game 	 s 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	``	doom	,	``	where	you	're	going	around	 shoot 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	violent	 game 	 s 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	fast	,	 aim 	 ed 	 	at	 teen 	 age 	 	 boy 	 s 	 	.	right	?	that	's	who	 play 	 s 	 	computer	 game 	 s 	 	.
well	,	guess	what	?	that	's	changing	.
``	bejeweled	``	is	a	big	hit	.	it	was	the	game	that	 re 	 ally 	 	broke	open	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	casual	 game 	 s 	 	.
and	the	main	 player 	 s 	 	are	over	35	,	and	are	female	.
then	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	``	rock	band	``	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	big	hit	.
and	it	's	a	game	you	play	with	other	people	.	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	physical	.	it	 look 	 s 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	like	a	 tradition 	 al 	 	game	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	's	 be 	 coming 	 	the	 domin 	 ant 	 	form	of	 electron 	 ic 	 	 gam 	 ing 	 	.
now	,	 with 	 in 	 	that	there	is	some	 interest 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
there	is	 al 	 so 	 	a	trend	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 game 	 s 	 	that	are	good	for	you	.	why	?	well	,	we	aging	 boom 	 ers 	 	,	baby	 boom 	 ers 	 	,	we	're	eating	our	 health 	 y 	 	food	,	we	're	 exercis 	 ing 	 	.	what	about	our	 mind 	 s 	 	?
oh	no	,	our	 parent 	 s 	 	are	 get 	 ting 	 	alzheimer	's	.	we	better	do	 some 	 thing 	 	.
 turn 	 s 	 	out	 do 	 ing 	 	 cross 	 word 	 	 puzzl 	 es 	 	can	 stav 	 e 	 	off	some	of	the	 effect 	 s 	 	of	alzheimer	's	.
so	,	we	got	 game 	 s 	 	like	``	brain	age	``	coming	out	for	the	nintendo	ds	,	huge	hit	.
a	lot	of	people	do	sudoku	.	in	fact	some	 doctor 	 s 	 	 pre 	 scribe 	 	it	.
and	then	there	is	social	media	,	and	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
 every 	 body 	 	now	 consider 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	a	creator	,	and	not	just	a	 view 	 er 	 	.
and	what	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	add	up	to	?
here	is	what	we	see	coming	.
it	's	 game 	 s 	 	that	fit	 in 	 to 	 	a	 health 	 y 	 	 life 	 style 	 	.
they	're	part	of	your	life	.	they	're	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	a	 separat 	 e 	 	thing	.
and	they	are	both	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	good	for	you	,	and	they	're	 f 	 un 	 	.
i	'm	a	 puzzl 	 e 	 	guy	.	my	wife	is	an	expert	in	social	media	.
and	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	combine	our	 skill 	 s 	 	.	our	first	game	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	photo	grab	.	``	the	game	 take 	 s 	 	about	a	minute	and	20	 second 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	your	first	time	 play 	 ing 	 	my	game	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
let	's	see	how	well	we	can	do	.	there	are	three	 image 	 s 	 	.	and	we	have	24	 second 	 s 	 	each	.
