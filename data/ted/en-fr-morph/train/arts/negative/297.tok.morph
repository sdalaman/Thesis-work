some	of	you	have	heard	the	story	before	,	but	,	in	fact	,	there	's	 some 	 body 	 	in	the	audience	who	's	never	heard	 th 	 is 	 	story	--	in	front	of	an	audience	--	before	,	so	i	'm	a	little	more	nervous	than	i	 normal 	 ly 	 	am	 tell 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	story	.
i	used	to	be	a	 photograph 	 er 	 	for	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	.
in	1978	,	i	was	 work 	 ing 	 	for	time	magazine	,	and	i	was	 give 	 n 	 	a	three	-	day	 assign 	 ment 	 	to	photograph	amerasian	children	,	children	who	had	 be 	 en 	 	 father 	 ed 	 	by	american	gis	all	over	 south 	 east 	 	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	,	and	then	 abandon 	 ed 	 	--
40,000	children	all	over	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	.
i	had	never	heard	the	word	amerasian	before	.
i	 s 	 pent 	 	a	few	 day 	 s 	 	 photograph 	 ing 	 	children	in	different	 count 	 ries 	 	,	and	like	a	lot	of	 photograph 	 ers 	 	and	a	lot	of	 journalist 	 s 	 	,	i	 al 	 ways 	 	hope	that	when	my	 picture 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	,	they	might	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	an	effect	on	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	just	 document 	 ing 	 	it	.
so	,	i	was	so	 disturb 	 ed 	 	by	what	i	saw	,	and	i	was	so	 un 	 happy 	 	with	the	article	that	ran	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	that	i	 decide 	 d 	 	i	would	take	six	 month 	 s 	 	off	.
i	was	28	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
i	 decide 	 d 	 	i	would	find	six	children	in	different	 count 	 ries 	 	,	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	go	 s 	 pend 	 	some	time	with	the	 kid 	 s 	 	,	and	try	to	tell	 the 	 ir 	 	story	a	little	bit	better	than	i	thought	i	had	 d 	 one 	 	for	time	magazine	.
in	the	course	of	 do 	 ing 	 	the	story	,	i	was	looking	for	children	who	had	n't	 be 	 en 	 	 photograph 	 ed 	 	before	,	and	the	pearl	buck	 found 	 ation 	 	told	me	that	they	 work 	 ed 	 	with	a	lot	of	americans	who	 we 	 re 	 	 don 	 ating 	 	money	to	help	some	of	these	 kid 	 s 	 	.
and	a	man	told	me	,	who	ran	the	pearl	buck	 found 	 ation 	 	in	korea	,	that	there	was	a	young	girl	,	who	was	11	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	 be 	 ing 	 	raised	by	her	 grand 	 mother 	 	.
and	the	 grand 	 mother 	 	had	never	let	any	westerners	ever	see	her	.
every	time	any	westerners	came	to	the	village	,	she	hid	the	girl	.
and	of	course	,	i	was	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	 intrigu 	 ed 	 	.
i	saw	 photograph 	 s 	 	of	her	,	and	i	thought	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	go	.
and	the	guy	just	told	me	,	``	there	's	no	way	.	 th 	 is 	 	 grand 	 mother 	 	wo	n't	even	--	you	know	,	there	's	no	way	she	's	ever	going	to	let	you	meet	 th 	 is 	 	girl	that	's	she	's	raising	.	``	i	took	a	 transl 	 ator 	 	with	me	,	and	went	to	 th 	 is 	 	village	,	found	the	 grand 	 mother 	 	,	 s 	 at 	 	down	with	her	.
and	to	my	 astonish 	 ment 	 	,	she	 agree 	 d 	 	to	let	me	photograph	her	 grand 	 daughter 	 	.
and	i	was	 pay 	 ing 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	 my 	 self 	 	,	so	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	 transl 	 ator 	 	if	it	would	be	ok	if	i	 stay 	 ed 	 	for	the	week	.
i	had	a	 sleep 	 ing 	 	bag	.
the	family	had	a	small	shed	on	the	side	of	the	house	,	so	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	could	i	sleep	in	my	 sleep 	 ing 	 	bag	in	the	 even 	 ing 	 s 	 	?	``
and	i	just	told	the	little	girl	,	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	name	was	hyun	-	sook	lee	,	that	if	i	ever	did	 any 	 thing 	 	to	embarrass	her	--	she	did	n't	speak	a	word	of	english	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	she	 look 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	american	--	she	could	just	put	up	her	hand	and	say	,	``	stop	,	``
and	i	would	stop	taking	 picture 	 s 	 	.
and	then	,	my	 transl 	 ator 	 	left	.
so	there	i	was	,	i	could	n't	speak	a	word	of	korean	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	night	i	met	hyun	-	sook	.
her	mother	was	still	 al 	 ive 	 	.
her	mother	was	not	raising	her	,	her	 grand 	 mother 	 	was	raising	her	.
and	what	 s 	 truck 	 	me	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	was	how	in	love	the	two	of	these	people	 we 	 re 	 	.
the	 grand 	 mother 	 	was	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	fond	,	 deep 	 ly 	 	in	love	with	 th 	 is 	 	little	girl	.
they	slept	on	the	floor	at	night	.
the	way	they	heat	 the 	 ir 	 	 home 	 s 	 	in	korea	is	to	put	 brick 	 s 	 	under	the	 floor 	 s 	 	,	so	the	heat	 actual 	 ly 	 	 radiate 	 s 	 	from	 under 	 neath 	 	the	floor	.
hyun	-	sook	was	11	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
i	had	 photograph 	 ed 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	a	lot	of	these	 kid 	 s 	 	.
hyun	-	sook	was	in	fact	the	fifth	child	that	i	found	to	photograph	.
and	 al 	 most 	 	 universal 	 ly 	 	,	 among 	 st 	 	all	the	 kid 	 s 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 psycho 	 logically 	 	 damage 	 d 	 	by	 hav 	 ing 	 	 be 	 en 	 	made	 f 	 un 	 	of	,	 ridicul 	 ed 	 	,	 pick 	 ed 	 	on	and	 be 	 en 	 	 reject 	 ed 	 	.
and	korea	was	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	place	i	found	to	be	the	worst	for	these	 kid 	 s 	 	.
and	what	 s 	 truck 	 	me	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	in	 meet 	 ing 	 	hyun	-	sook	was	how	confident	she	 appear 	 ed 	 	to	be	,	how	happy	she	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	be	in	her	own	skin	.
and	remember	 th 	 is 	 	picture	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	going	to	show	you	 an 	 other 	 	picture	 lat 	 er 	 	,	but	you	can	see	how	much	she	 look 	 s 	 	like	her	 grand 	 mother 	 	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	she	 look 	 s 	 	so	western	.
i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	follow	her	to	school	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	 morn 	 ing 	 	i	 stay 	 ed 	 	with	her	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	on	the	way	to	school	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	 assem 	 bly 	 	 out 	 side 	 	her	school	.
and	i	 notice 	 d 	 	that	she	was	 clown 	 ing 	 	around	.
when	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	would	ask	 question 	 s 	 	,	she	'd	be	the	first	person	to	raise	her	hand	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	not	at	all	 s 	 hy 	 	or	 withdraw 	 n 	 	,	or	 any 	 thing 	 	like	the	other	children	that	i	'd	 photograph 	 ed 	 	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	first	one	to	go	to	the	 black 	 board 	 	to	answer	 question 	 s 	 	.
 get 	 ting 	 	in	trouble	for	 whisper 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	her	best	friend	's	 ear 	 s 	 	in	the	middle	of	class	.
and	one	of	the	other	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	 s 	 aid 	 	to	her	through	the	 transl 	 ator 	 	--	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	thing	about	 say 	 ing 	 	stop	--	was	to	not	pay	attention	to	me	.
and	so	,	she	 re 	 ally 	 	just	 complete 	 ly 	 	 ignor 	 ed 	 	me	most	of	the	time	.
i	 notice 	 d 	 	that	at	recess	,	she	was	the	girl	who	 pick 	 ed 	 	the	other	 girl 	 s 	 	to	be	on	her	team	.
it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	obvious	,	from	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	that	she	was	a	 lead 	 er 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	on	the	way	home	.
and	that	's	north	korea	up	 a 	 long 	 	the	hill	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	up	 a 	 long 	 	the	dmz	.
they	would	 actual 	 ly 	 	cover	the	 window 	 s 	 	every	night	,	so	that	light	could	n't	be	 s 	 een 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	south	korean	government	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	for	 year 	 s 	 	that	the	north	koreans	may	 invad 	 e 	 	at	any	time	.
so	there	's	 al 	 ways 	 	 th 	 is 	 	--	the	 close 	 r 	 	you	 we 	 re 	 	to	north	korea	,	the	more	 terrify 	 ing 	 	it	was	.
 ver 	 y 	 	often	at	school	,	i	'd	be	taking	 picture 	 s 	 	,	and	she	would	whisper	 in 	 to 	 	her	 girlfriend 	 s 	 	'	 ear 	 s 	 	,	and	then	look	at	me	and	say	,	``	stop	.	``
and	i	would	stand	at	attention	,	and	all	the	 girl 	 s 	 	would	crack	up	,	and	it	was	sort	of	a	little	joke	.
the	end	of	the	week	came	and	my	 transl 	 ator 	 	came	back	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'd	 ask 	 ed 	 	her	to	come	back	,	so	i	could	 form 	 ally 	 	thank	the	 grand 	 mother 	 	and	hyun	-	sook	.
and	in	the	course	of	the	 grand 	 mother 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	the	 transl 	 ator 	 	,	the	 grand 	 mother 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	 cry 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	to	my	 transl 	 ator 	 	,	``	what	's	going	on	,	why	is	she	 cry 	 ing 	 	?	``
and	she	spoke	to	the	 grand 	 mother 	 	for	a	moment	,	and	then	she	 start 	 ed 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 tear 	 s 	 	in	her	 eye 	 s 	 	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	ok	,	what	did	i	do	?	what	's	going	on	?	why	is	 every 	 one 	 	 cry 	 ing 	 	?	``	and	the	 transl 	 ator 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	the	 grand 	 mother 	 	 say 	 s 	 	that	she	 think 	 s 	 	she	's	 dy 	 ing 	 	,	and	she	 want 	 s 	 	to	know	if	you	would	take	hyun	-	sook	to	america	with	you	.	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'm	28	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	and	i	live	in	 hotel 	 s 	 	,	and	i	'm	not	married	.	``	i	mean	i	had	 fall 	 en 	 	in	love	with	 th 	 is 	 	girl	,	but	i	--	you	know	,	it	was	,	like	,	 emotion 	 ally 	 	i	was	about	12	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
if	you	know	of	 photograph 	 ers 	 	,	the	joke	is	it	's	the	 fin 	 est 	 	form	of	 delay 	 ed 	 	adolescence	ever	 invent 	 ed 	 	.	``	sorry	,	i	have	to	go	on	an	 assign 	 ment 	 	,	i	'll	be	back	``	--
and	then	you	never	come	back	.
so	,	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	 transl 	 ator 	 	why	she	thought	she	was	 dy 	 ing 	 	.
can	i	get	her	to	a	hospital	?	could	i	pay	to	get	her	a	doctor	?
and	she	 re 	 fused 	 	any	help	at	all	.
and	so	,	when	i	got	 out 	 side 	 	,	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	the	 transl 	 ator 	 	some	money	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 pleas 	 e 	 	go	back	and	see	if	you	can	do	 some 	 thing 	 	.	``	and	i	 g 	 ave 	 	the	 grand 	 mother 	 	my	business	card	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	if	you	're	serious	,	i	will	try	to	find	a	family	for	her	.	``
and	i	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	wrote	a	letter	to	my	best	 friend 	 s 	 	in	atlanta	,	georgia	,	who	had	an	11	-	year	-	old	son	.
and	my	best	friend	had	 mistak 	 en 	 ly 	 	one	day	 s 	 aid 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	about	 wish 	 ing 	 	he	had	 an 	 other 	 	child	.
so	here	my	 friend 	 s 	 	gene	and	gail	had	not	heard	from	me	in	about	a	year	,
and	 sudden 	 ly 	 	i	was	 call 	 ing 	 	,	 say 	 ing 	 	``	i	'm	in	korea	,	and	i	've	met	 th 	 is 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	girl	.	``	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	the	 grand 	 mother 	 	 think 	 s 	 	she	's	sick	,	but	i	think	 may 	 be 	 	we	would	have	to	 br 	 ing 	 	the	 grand 	 mother 	 	over	 al 	 so 	 	.	``	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'll	pay	for	the	...	``	i	mean	,	i	had	 th 	 is 	 	whole	sort	of	picture	.

i	 figur 	 ed 	 	i	'd	come	back	in	a	couple	of	 week 	 s 	 	and	talk	to	the	 grand 	 mother 	 	.
and	on	christmas	day	,	i	was	in	bangkok	with	a	group	of	 photograph 	 ers 	 	and	got	a	 tele 	 gram 	 	--	back	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 day 	 s 	 	,	you	got	 tele 	 gram 	 s 	 	--	from	time	magazine	 say 	 ing 	 	 some 	 one 	 	in	korea	had	 di 	 ed 	 	,	and	left	 the 	 ir 	 	child	in	a	will	to	me	.
did	i	know	 any 	 thing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	i	had	n't	told	them	what	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	so	 up 	 set 	 	with	the	story	they	'd	run	.
so	,	i	went	back	to	korea	,	and	i	went	back	to	hyun	-	sook	's	village	,	and	she	was	gone	.
and	the	house	that	i	had	 s 	 pent 	 	time	in	was	empty	.
it	was	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	cold	.
no	one	in	the	village	would	tell	me	where	hyun	-	sook	was	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 grand 	 mother 	 	had	 al 	 ways 	 	 hid 	 den 	 	her	from	westerners	.
and	they	had	no	idea	about	 th 	 is 	 	request	that	she	'd	made	of	me	.
so	i	 final 	 ly 	 	found	myung	 s 	 ung 	 	,	her	best	friend	that	she	used	to	play	with	after	school	every	day	.
and	myung	 s 	 ung 	 	,	under	some	pressure	from	me	and	the	 transl 	 ator 	 	,	 g 	 ave 	 	us	an	address	on	the	 out 	 side 	 	of	seoul	.
and	i	went	to	that	address	and	 knock 	 ed 	 	on	the	door	,	and	a	man	 answer 	 ed 	 	the	door	.
it	was	not	a	 ver 	 y 	 	nice	area	of	seoul	,	 a 	 s 	 	there	 we 	 re 	 	mud	 street 	 s 	 	 out 	 side 	 	of	it	.

and	 th 	 is 	 	man	came	to	the	door	and	kind	of	 bark 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	in	korean	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	to	the	 transl 	 ator 	 	,	``	what	did	he	say	?	``
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	he	 want 	 s 	 	to	know	who	you	are	.	``

and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	to	them	,	``	look	,	there	's	a	little	girl	who	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 tin 	 y 	 	chance	of	 get 	 ting 	 	out	of	here	and	going	to	america	.	``	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	do	n't	know	if	it	's	the	right	decision	or	not	,	but	i	would	like	you	to	come	to	lunch	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	and	tell	the	uncle	what	it	's	like	to	walk	down	the	street	,	what	people	say	to	you	,	what	you	do	for	a	living	.
and	just	--	i	want	him	to	understand	what	 happen 	 s 	 	if	she	 stay 	 s 	 	here	.
and	i	could	be	wrong	,	i	do	n't	know	,	but	i	wish	you	would	come	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	.	``	so	,	these	two	came	to	lunch	,	and	we	got	 throw 	 n 	 	out	of	the	restaurant	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 yell 	 ing 	 	at	him	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	--	it	got	to	be	 re 	 ally 	 	 ug 	 ly 	 	.
and	we	went	 out 	 side 	 	,	and	he	was	just	 fur 	 ious 	 	.
and	i	 k 	 new 	 	i	had	 total 	 ly 	 	blown	 th 	 is 	 	whole	thing	.
here	i	was	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	what	to	do	.
and	he	 start 	 ed 	 	 yell 	 ing 	 	at	me	,	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	to	the	 transl 	 ator 	 	,	``	ok	,	tell	him	to	calm	down	,	what	is	he	 say 	 ing 	 	?	``
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	he	's	 say 	 ing 	 	,	'	who	the	hell	are	you	to	walk	 in 	 to 	 	my	house	,	some	rich	american	with	your	 camera 	 s 	 	around	your	neck	,	 accus 	 ing 	 	me	of	 en 	 s 	 lav 	 ing 	 	my	niece	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	my	niece	,	i	love	her	,	she	's	my	sister	's	daughter	.
who	the	hell	are	you	to	 accus 	 e 	 	me	of	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	?	'	``	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	you	know	,	``	look	,	``	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	're	 absolute 	 ly 	 	right	.
i	do	n't	pretend	to	understand	what	's	going	on	here	.	``	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	all	i	know	is	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 photograph 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	these	children	.	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'm	in	love	with	your	niece	,	i	think	she	's	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	special	child	.	``	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	look	,	i	will	fly	my	 friend 	 s 	 	over	here	from	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	if	you	want	to	meet	them	,	to	see	if	you	 ap 	 prove 	 	of	them	.
i	just	think	that	--	what	little	i	know	about	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	she	 ha 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	little	chance	here	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	kind	of	life	that	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	would	like	her	to	have	.	``	so	,	 every 	 one 	 	told	me	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	that	 invit 	 ing 	 	the	 prospect 	 ive 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	over	was	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	 stupid 	 est 	 	thing	i	could	have	possibly	 d 	 one 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	who	's	ever	good	 en 	 ough 	 	for	your	 relat 	 ive 	 	?
but	he	 invit 	 ed 	 	me	to	come	to	a	 ce 	 re 	 mon 	 y 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	that	day	for	her	 grand 	 mother 	 	.
and	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	take	 item 	 s 	 	of	 cloth 	 ing 	 	and	 photograph 	 s 	 	,	and	they	burn	them	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	the	ritual	.
and	you	can	see	how	different	she	 look 	 s 	 	just	in	three	 month 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	now	,	i	think	,	february	,	early	february	.
and	the	 picture 	 s 	 	before	 we 	 re 	 	taken	in	september	.
well	,	there	was	an	american	marine	priest	that	i	had	met	in	the	course	of	 do 	 ing 	 	the	story	,	who	had	75	children	living	in	his	house	.
he	had	three	women	 help 	 ing 	 	him	take	care	of	these	 kid 	 s 	 	.
and	so	i	 suggest 	 ed 	 	to	the	uncle	that	we	go	down	and	meet	father	keene	,	to	find	out	how	the	 adopt 	 ion 	 	process	 work 	 ed 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	 want 	 ed 	 	him	to	feel	like	 th 	 is 	 	was	all	 be 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	above	board	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	on	the	way	down	to	the	 orphan 	 age 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	father	keene	.	he	's	just	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	guy	.
he	had	 kid 	 s 	 	from	all	over	korea	living	there	,	and	he	would	find	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	for	these	 kid 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	social	 work 	 er 	 	 interview 	 ing 	 	hyun	-	sook	.
now	,	i	had	 al 	 ways 	 	thought	she	was	 complete 	 ly 	 	 un 	 touch 	 ed 	 	by	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 grand 	 mother 	 	,	to	me	,	 appear 	 ed 	 	to	be	sort	of	the	village	wise	woman	,	and	the	person	 every 	 body 	 	--	 through 	 out 	 	the	day	,	i	 notice 	 d 	 	people	 ke 	 pt 	 	coming	to	visit	her	 grand 	 mother 	 	.
and	i	 al 	 ways 	 	had	 th 	 is 	 	mental	picture	that	even	 th 	 ough 	 	they	may	have	 be 	 en 	 	one	of	the	 poor 	 er 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	in	the	village	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	one	of	the	most	 respect 	 ed 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	in	the	village	.
and	i	 al 	 ways 	 	felt	that	the	 grand 	 mother 	 	had	kind	of	 demand 	 ed 	 	,	and	 insist 	 ed 	 	,	that	the	 village 	 rs 	 	treat	hyun	-	sook	with	the	same	respect	they	 treat 	 ed 	 	her	.
hyun	-	sook	 stay 	 ed 	 	at	father	keene	's	,	and	her	uncle	 agree 	 d 	 	to	let	her	stay	there	 un 	 til 	 	the	 adopt 	 ion 	 	went	through	.
he	 actual 	 ly 	 	 agree 	 d 	 	to	the	 adopt 	 ion 	 	.
and	i	went	off	on	 assign 	 ment 	 	and	came	back	a	week	 lat 	 er 	 	,	and	father	keene	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	've	got	to	talk	to	you	about	hyun	-	sook	.	``
i	kind	of	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	oh	god	,	now	what	?	``
and	he	 take 	 s 	 	me	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	and	he	 close 	 s 	 	the	door	,	and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	have	75	children	here	in	the	 orphan 	 age 	 	,	and	it	's	total	 bed 	 lam 	 	.	``
and	there	's	 clothe 	 s 	 	,	and	there	's	 kid 	 s 	 	,	and	,	you	know	,	there	's	three	 adult 	 s 	 	and	75	 kid 	 s 	 	--	you	can	imagine	.	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	the	second	day	she	was	here	she	made	up	a	list	of	all	of	the	 name 	 s 	 	of	the	 old 	 er 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	and	the	 young 	 er 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	.
and	she	 assign 	 ed 	 	one	of	the	 old 	 er 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	to	each	of	the	 young 	 er 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	.
and	then	she	set	up	a	work	detail	list	of	who	 clean 	 ed 	 	the	 orphan 	 age 	 	on	what	day	.	``	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	she	's	 tell 	 ing 	 	me	that	i	'm	 mess 	 y 	 	,	and	i	have	to	clean	up	my	room	.	``
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	do	n't	know	who	raised	her	,	but	,	``	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	she	's	running	the	 orphan 	 age 	 	,	and	she	's	 be 	 en 	 	here	three	 day 	 s 	 	.	``	 th 	 is 	 	was	movie	day	--	that	she	 organize 	 d 	 	--	where	all	the	 kid 	 s 	 	went	to	the	 movie 	 s 	 	.
a	lot	of	the	 kid 	 s 	 	who	had	 be 	 en 	 	 adopt 	 ed 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	wrote	back	to	the	other	 kid 	 s 	 	,	 tell 	 ing 	 	them	about	what	 the 	 ir 	 	life	was	like	with	 the 	 ir 	 	new	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	.
so	,	it	was	a	 re 	 ally 	 	big	deal	when	the	 letter 	 s 	 	 show 	 ed 	 	up	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	woman	who	is	now	 work 	 ing 	 	at	the	 orphan 	 age 	 	,	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	son	had	 be 	 en 	 	 adopt 	 ed 	 	.
gene	and	gail	 start 	 ed 	 	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	korean	the	moment	they	had	gotten	my	first	letter	.
they	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	able	to	welcome	hyun	-	sook	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	family	.
and	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	father	keene	told	me	when	i	came	back	from	one	of	these	 trip 	 s 	 	--	hyun	-	sook	had	 chose 	 n 	 	the	name	natasha	,	which	i	 under 	 stood 	 	was	from	her	 watch 	 ing 	 	a	``	 rock 	 y 	 	and	bullwinkle	``	cartoon	on	the	american	air	force	station	.
 th 	 is 	 	may	be	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	myth	-	buster	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	'll	have	to	clear	up	here	,	in	a	minute	.
so	,	my	friend	gene	flew	over	with	his	son	,	tim	.
gail	could	n't	come	.
and	they	 s 	 pent 	 	a	lot	of	time	 huddl 	 ed 	 	over	a	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	gene	 show 	 ing 	 	the	uncle	where	atlanta	was	on	the	map	,	where	he	lived	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	uncle	 sign 	 ing 	 	the	 adopt 	 ion 	 	 paper 	 s 	 	.
now	,	we	went	out	to	 d 	 inner 	 	that	night	to	 celebr 	 ate 	 	.
the	uncle	went	back	to	his	family	,	and	natasha	and	tim	and	gene	and	i	went	out	to	 d 	 inner 	 	.
and	gene	was	 show 	 ing 	 	natasha	how	to	use	a	knife	and	 for 	 k 	 	,	and	then	natasha	was	 return 	 ing 	 	the	utensil	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	.
we	went	back	to	our	hotel	room	,	and	gene	was	 show 	 ing 	 	natasha	 al 	 so 	 	where	atlanta	was	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	third	night	we	 we 	 re 	 	in	korea	.
the	first	night	we	'd	gotten	a	room	for	the	 kid 	 s 	 	right	next	to	us	.
now	,	i	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 stay 	 ing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	for	about	three	 month 	 s 	 	--	it	was	a	little	15	-	story	korean	hotel	.
so	,	the	second	night	,	we	did	n't	keep	the	 kid 	 s 	 	'	room	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	went	down	and	slept	on	the	floor	with	all	the	 kid 	 s 	 	at	the	 orphan 	 age 	 	.
and	the	third	night	,	we	came	back	,	we	'd	just	gone	out	to	 d 	 inner 	 	,	where	you	saw	the	 picture 	 s 	 	,	and	we	got	to	the	front	desk	and	the	guy	at	the	front	desk	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	there	's	no	other	free	rooms	on	your	floor	 to 	 night 	 	,	so	if	you	want	to	put	the	 kid 	 s 	 	five	 floor 	 s 	 	 be 	 low 	 	you	,	there	's	a	room	there	.	``	and	gene	and	i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	each	other	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	we	do	n't	want	two	11	-	year	-	olds	five	 floor 	 s 	 	away	.	``
so	,	his	son	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	dad	,	i	have	a	 sleep 	 ing 	 	bag	,	i	'll	sleep	on	the	floor	.	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	,	i	have	one	too	.	``
so	,	tim	and	i	slept	on	the	floor	,	natasha	got	one	bed	,	gene	got	the	other	--	 kid 	 s 	 	pass	out	,	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	for	three	 day 	 s 	 	.
we	're	 ly 	 ing 	 	in	bed	,	and	gene	and	i	are	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	how	cool	we	are	.
we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	that	was	so	great	,	we	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	little	girl	's	life	.	``
we	 we 	 re 	 	just	like	,	you	know	,	ah	,	just	full	of	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
and	we	fall	 a 	 sleep 	 	--	and	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	you	know	,	for	a	couple	of	 month 	 s 	 	now	.
and	they	 al 	 ways 	 	 over 	 heat 	 	the	 hotel 	 s 	 	in	korea	 terr 	 ibly 	 	,	so	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	day	i	 al 	 ways 	 	left	the	window	open	.
and	then	,	at	night	,	about	 mid 	 night 	 	,	they	turn	the	heat	off	in	the	hotel	.	so	at	about	1	 a.m 	 . 	 	,	the	whole	room	would	be	like	20	 be 	 low 	 	zero	,	and	i	'd	get	up	.
i	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	every	night	i	'd	 be 	 en 	 	there	.
so	,	 s 	 ure 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	it	's	one	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	,	room	's	freezing	,	i	go	to	close	the	window	,	and	i	hear	people	 shout 	 ing 	 	 out 	 side 	 	,	and	i	thought	,	``	oh	,	the	 bar 	 s 	 	must	have	just	gotten	out	.	``
and	i	do	n't	speak	korean	,	but	i	'm	 hear 	 ing 	 	these	 voice 	 s 	 	,	and	i	'm	not	 hear 	 ing 	 	anger	,	i	'm	 hear 	 ing 	 	terror	.
so	,	i	open	the	window	,	and	i	look	out	,	and	there	's	 flame 	 s 	 	coming	up	the	side	of	our	hotel	,	and	the	hotel	's	on	fire	.
so	,	i	run	over	to	gene	,	and	i	wake	him	up	,	and	i	say	,	``	gene	,	do	n't	freak	out	,	i	think	the	hotel	's	on	fire	.	``
and	now	there	's	smoke	and	 flame 	 s 	 	coming	by	our	 window 	 s 	 	--	we	're	on	the	 eleven 	 th 	 	floor	.
so	,	the	two	of	us	 we 	 re 	 	just	like	,	``	oh	my	god	,	oh	my	god	.	``
so	,	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	natasha	up	,	and	we	ca	n't	talk	to	her	.
and	you	know	what	 kid 	 s 	 	are	like	when	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	 a 	 sleep 	 	for	like	an	hour	,	it	's	like	they	took	five	valiums	--	you	know	,	they	're	all	over	the	place	.
and	we	ca	n't	talk	to	her	.
i	remember	his	son	had	the	l.l	.	bean	 boot 	 lace 	 s 	 	,	and	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	up	his	 lace 	 s 	 	.
so	,	we	try	to	get	to	the	door	,	and	we	run	to	the	door	,	and	we	open	the	door	and	it	's	like	 walk 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	blast	furnace	.
there	's	people	 s 	 cream 	 ing 	 	,	there	's	the	sound	of	glass	 break 	 ing 	 	,	there	's	these	weird	 thump 	 s 	 	.
and	the	whole	room	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	smoke	in	about	two	 second 	 s 	 	.
and	gene	 turn 	 s 	 	around	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	we	're	not	going	to	make	it	.	``	and	he	 close 	 s 	 	the	door	,	and	the	whole	room	is	now	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	smoke	.
we	're	all	 cho 	 king 	 	,	and	there	's	smoke	 pour 	 ing 	 	through	the	 vent 	 s 	 	,	under	the	 door 	 s 	 	.	there	's	people	 s 	 cream 	 ing 	 	.
i	just	remember	 th 	 is 	 	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	,	just	utter	 cha 	 os 	 	.
i	remember	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	near	the	bed	,	and	i	was	just	so	--	i	had	two	 overwhelm 	 ing 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
one	was	absolute	terror	--	it	's	like	,	``	oh	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	god	,	i	just	want	to	wake	up	.	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	got	to	be	a	nightmare	,	 th 	 is 	 	ca	n't	be	 happen 	 ing 	 	.	 pleas 	 e 	 	,	i	just	want	to	wake	up	,	it	's	got	to	be	a	nightmare	.	``	and	the	other	is	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	guilt	.
here	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	,	 play 	 ing 	 	god	with	my	 friend 	 s 	 	'	 live 	 s 	 	,	my	 friend 	 s 	 	'	son	,	with	natasha	's	life	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	what	you	get	when	you	try	 play 	 ing 	 	god	,	is	you	hurt	people	.
i	remember	just	 be 	 ing 	 	so	 frighten 	 ed 	 	and	 terr 	 ified 	 	.
and	gene	,	who	's	 ly 	 ing 	 	on	the	floor	,	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	man	,	we	've	got	to	soak	 to 	 wel 	 s 	 	.	``	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	?	``
he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	we	've	got	to	soak	 to 	 wel 	 s 	 	.	we	're	going	to	die	from	the	smoke	.	``
so	,	we	ran	to	the	 bath 	 room 	 	,	and	got	 to 	 wel 	 s 	 	,	and	put	them	over	our	 face 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 kid 	 s 	 	 face 	 s 	 	.
then	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	do	you	have	 ga 	 ffer 	 	's	tape	?	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	?	``	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	do	you	have	 ga 	 ffer 	 	's	tape	?	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	,	 some 	 where 	 	in	my	halliburton	.	``
he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	we	've	got	to	stop	the	smoke	.	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	that	's	all	we	can	do	,	we	've	got	to	stop	the	smoke	.	``
i	mean	,	gene	--	thank	god	for	gene	.
so	,	we	put	the	room	service	 menu 	 s 	 	over	the	 vent 	 s 	 	in	the	wall	,	we	put	 blank 	 et 	 s 	 	at	the	bottom	of	the	door	,	we	put	the	 kid 	 s 	 	on	the	 window 	 s 	 ill 	 	to	try	to	get	some	air	.	and	there	was	a	building	,	a	new	building	,	going	up	,	that	was	 be 	 ing 	 	built	right	 out 	 side 	 	,	 a 	 cross 	 	the	street	from	our	hotel	.
and	there	,	in	the	building	 we 	 re 	 	 photograph 	 ers 	 	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	people	to	jump	.
eleven	people	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 dy 	 ing 	 	in	the	fire	.
five	people	 jump 	 ed 	 	and	 di 	 ed 	 	,	other	people	 we 	 re 	 	 kill 	 ed 	 	by	the	smoke	.
and	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	loud	 thump 	 ing 	 	on	the	door	after	about	45	 minute 	 s 	 	in	all	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	people	 we 	 re 	 	 shout 	 ing 	 	in	korean	.
and	i	remember	,	natasha	did	n't	want	us	 open 	 ing 	 	the	door	--	sorry	,	i	was	 try 	 ing 	 	not	to	open	the	door	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	'd	 s 	 pent 	 	so	much	time	 barricad 	 ing 	 	the	room	.
i	did	n't	know	who	it	was	,	i	did	n't	know	what	they	 want 	 ed 	 	,	and	natasha	could	tell	they	 we 	 re 	 	 fire 	 men 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	us	out	.
i	remember	a	sort	of	a	tussle	at	the	door	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	the	door	open	.
in	any	case	,	12	 hour 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	i	mean	,	they	put	us	in	the	lobby	.
gene	 end 	 ed 	 	up	using	his	coat	,	and	his	fist	in	the	coat	,	to	break	open	a	liquor	cabinet	.
people	 we 	 re 	 	 ly 	 ing 	 	on	the	floor	.
it	was	one	of	just	the	most	 horr 	 ifying 	 	 night 	 s 	 	.
and	then	12	 hour 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	we	 rent 	 ed 	 	a	car	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	had	 plan 	 ned 	 	to	,	and	drove	back	to	natasha	's	village	.
and	we	 ke 	 pt 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	do	you	 real 	 ize 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	 dy 	 ing 	 	in	a	hotel	fire	,	like	eight	 hour 	 s 	 	ago	?	``
it	's	so	weird	how	life	just	 go 	 es 	 	on	.
natasha	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 introduc 	 e 	 	her	brother	and	father	to	all	the	 village 	 rs 	 	,	and	the	day	we	 show 	 ed 	 	up	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	a	60	-	year	-	old	man	's	 birth 	 day 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	guy	's	60	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
so	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	dual	 celebr 	 ation 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	natasha	was	the	first	person	from	 th 	 is 	 	village	ever	to	go	to	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
so	,	these	are	the	 green 	 house 	 	 tent 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 elder 	 s 	 	 teach 	 ing 	 	gene	 the 	 ir 	 	 dance 	 s 	 	.
we	 d 	 rank 	 	a	lot	of	rice	wine	.	we	 we 	 re 	 	both	so	drunk	,	i	could	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	last	picture	before	gene	and	tim	headed	back	.
the	 adopt 	 ion 	 	people	told	us	it	was	going	to	take	a	year	for	the	 adopt 	 ion 	 	to	go	through	.
like	,	what	could	you	do	for	a	year	?
so	i	found	out	the	name	of	every	official	on	both	the	korean	and	american	side	,	and	i	 photograph 	 ed 	 	them	,	and	told	them	how	famous	they	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	be	when	 th 	 is 	 	book	was	 d 	 one 	 	.
and	four	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	the	 adopt 	 ion 	 	 paper 	 s 	 	came	through	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 say 	 ing 	 	 good 	 bye 	 	to	 every 	 body 	 	at	the	 orphan 	 age 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	father	keene	with	natasha	at	the	bus	stop	.
her	great	aunt	at	the	 air 	 port 	 	.
i	had	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	deal	with	cathay	 pac 	 ific 	 	 air 	 lines 	 	for	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	,	where	they	 g 	 ave 	 	me	free	 pass 	 es 	 	on	all	 the 	 ir 	 	 air 	 lines 	 	in	return	for	 photograph 	 y 	 	.
it	was	like	the	ultimate	perk	.
and	the	pilot	,	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	 k 	 new 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	they	used	to	let	me	 s 	 it 	 	in	the	jump	seat	,	to	tell	you	how	long	ago	 th 	 is 	 	was	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	tri	-	star	,	and	so	they	let	natasha	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 it 	 	in	the	jump	seat	.
and	the	pilot	,	jeff	cowley	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	went	back	and	 adopt 	 ed 	 	one	of	the	other	 kid 	 s 	 	at	the	 orphan 	 age 	 	after	 meet 	 ing 	 	natasha	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	28	 hour 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	in	atlanta	.	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	long	flight	.
just	to	make	 thing 	 s 	 	even	 crazi 	 er 	 	,	gail	,	natasha	's	new	mom	,	was	three	 day 	 s 	 	away	from	giving	birth	to	her	own	daughter	.
so	you	know	,	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	writing	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	'd	say	,	``	no	,	we	've	got	to	write	the	script	 different 	 ly 	 	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	night	 show 	 ing 	 	natasha	her	new	 cousin 	 s 	 	and	 uncle 	 s 	 	and	 aunt 	 s 	 	.
gene	and	gail	know	 every 	 one 	 	in	atlanta	--	they	're	the	most	social	couple	 imagin 	 able 	 	.
so	,	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	natasha	 do 	 es 	 	n't	speak	a	word	of	english	,	other	than	what	little	father	keene	taught	her	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	kylie	,	her	sister	,	who	's	now	a	doctor	,	on	the	right	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	deal	i	had	with	natasha	,	which	is	that	when	we	got	to	atlanta	she	could	take	--	she	could	cut	off	my	beard	.
she	never	 like 	 d 	 	it	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
she	 learn 	 ed 	 	english	in	three	 month 	 s 	 	.
she	 enter 	 ed 	 	 seven 	 th 	 	grade	at	her	own	age	level	.
 pledg 	 e 	 	of	allegiance	for	the	first	time	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	her	 cook 	 ing 	 	teacher	.
natasha	told	me	that	a	lot	of	the	 kid 	 s 	 	thought	she	was	 s 	 tuck 	 	up	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	would	talk	to	her	and	she	would	n't	answer	,	and	they	did	n't	 real 	 ize 	 	she	did	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	speak	english	 ver 	 y 	 	well	,	in	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
but	what	i	 notice 	 d 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	 observ 	 er 	 	,	was	she	was	 choos 	 ing 	 	who	was	going	to	be	on	her	team	,
and	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	popular	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
now	,	remember	the	picture	,	how	much	she	 look 	 ed 	 	like	her	 grand 	 mother 	 	,	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	?
people	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 tell 	 ing 	 	natasha	how	much	she	 look 	 s 	 	like	her	mother	,	gail	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	tense	moment	in	the	first	 foot 	 ball 	 	game	,	i	think	.
and	kylie	--	i	mean	,	it	was	 al 	 most 	 	like	kylie	was	her	own	child	.
she	's	 be 	 ing 	 	 b 	 apt 	 ized 	 	.
