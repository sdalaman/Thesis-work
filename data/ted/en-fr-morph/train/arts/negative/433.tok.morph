 th 	 is 	 	is	a	wheat	bread	,	a	whole	wheat	bread	,	and	it	's	made	with	a	new	 techni 	 que 	 	that	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	around	with	,	and	 develop 	 ing 	 	and	writing	about	which	,	for	lack	of	a	better	name	,	we	call	the	 ep 	 oxy 	 	method	.
and	i	call	it	an	 ep 	 oxy 	 	method	 be 	 cause 	 	--	it	's	not	 ver 	 y 	 	 appetiz 	 ing 	 	.	i	understand	that	--	but	--	but	if	you	think	about	 ep 	 oxy 	 	,	what	's	 ep 	 oxy 	 	?
it	's	two	 re 	 s 	 in 	 s 	 	that	are	,	sort	of	,	in	and	of	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	--	 n 	 either 	 	of	which	can	make	glue	,	but	when	you	put	the	two	together	,	 some 	 thing 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	.	a	bond	 take 	 s 	 	place	,	and	you	get	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	,	 power 	 ful 	 	 ad 	 he 	 s 	 ive 	 	.
well	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	 techni 	 que 	 	,	what	i	've	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	do	is	kind	of	gather	all	of	the	knowledge	that	the	bread	-	 ba 	 king 	 	world	,	the	artisan	bread	-	 ba 	 king 	 	community	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 accumul 	 ate 	 	over	the	last	20	 year 	 s 	 	or	so	--	since	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 engag 	 ed 	 	in	a	bread	 ren 	 aiss 	 ance 	 	in	america	--	and	put	it	together	to	come	up	with	a	method	that	would	help	to	take	whole	-	grain	 bread 	 s 	 	.
and	let	's	face	it	,	 every 	 one 	 	's	 try 	 ing 	 	to	move	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	whole	 grain 	 s 	 	.
we	 final 	 ly 	 	,	after	40	 year 	 s 	 	of	 know 	 ing 	 	that	 whole 	 grain 	 	was	a	 health 	 ier 	 	option	,	we	're	 final 	 ly 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	to	the	point	where	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	are	 tip 	 ping 	 	over	and	 attempt 	 ing 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	eat	them	.
the	 challeng 	 e 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	for	a	 whole 	 grain 	 	 bake 	 r 	 	is	,	you	know	,	how	do	you	make	it	taste	good	?
 be 	 cause 	 	whole	grain	--	it	's	easy	with	white	flour	to	make	a	good	-	tasting	bread	.	white	flour	is	sweet	.
it	's	 main 	 ly 	 	starch	,	and	starch	,	when	you	break	it	down	--	what	is	starch	?	it	's	--	thank	you	--	sugar	,	 y 	 es 	 	.
so	a	 bake 	 r 	 	,	and	a	good	 bake 	 r 	 	,	 know 	 s 	 	how	to	pull	or	draw	forth	the	inherent	sugar	trapped	in	the	starch	.
with	whole	grain	bread	,	you	have	other	 obstacle 	 s 	 	.
you	've	got	bran	,	which	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	 health 	 iest 	 	part	of	the	bread	for	us	,	or	the	fiber	for	us	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	just	 load 	 ed 	 	with	fiber	,
for	the	bran	is	fiber	.
it	's	got	germ	.	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	good	 thing 	 s 	 	,	but	 t 	 hose 	 	are	n't	the	 ta 	 s 	 tiest 	 	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	wheat	.
so	whole	grain	 bread 	 s 	 	 historic 	 ally 	 	have	had	sort	of	 th 	 is 	 	 on 	 us 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	health	food	 bread 	 s 	 	,
and	people	do	n't	like	to	eat	,	quote	,	health	food	.	they	like	to	eat	 health 	 y 	 	and	 health 	 ily 	 	,	but	when	we	think	of	 some 	 thing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	health	food	,	we	think	of	it	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	we	eat	out	of	 oblig 	 ation 	 	,	not	out	of	 pass 	 ion 	 	and	love	for	the	flavor	.
and	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	of	the	 bake 	 r 	 	,	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	of	every	 cul 	 in 	 ary 	 	student	,	of	every	chef	,	is	to	deliver	flavor	.
flavor	is	king	.	flavor	 rule 	 s 	 	.
i	call	it	the	flavor	rule	.	flavor	 rule 	 s 	 	.
and	--	and
you	can	get	 some 	 body 	 	to	eat	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	good	for	them	once	,	but	they	wo	n't	eat	it	 aga 	 in 	 	if	they	do	n't	like	it	,	right	?
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	bread	.
we	're	going	to	try	 th 	 is 	 	at	lunch	,	and	i	'll	explain	a	bit	more	about	it	,	but	it	's	made	not	 on 	 ly 	 	with	two	 type 	 s 	 	of	pre	-	doughs	--
 th 	 is 	 	attempt	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	at	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	out	flavor	is	to	make	a	piece	of	dough	the	day	before	that	is	not	 leaven 	 ed 	 	.
it	's	just	dough	that	is	wet	.
it	's	 hyd 	 rated 	 	dough	we	call	``	the	 soak 	 er 	 	``	--	that	 help 	 s 	 	to	start	enzyme	activity	.
and	 enzyme 	 s 	 	are	the	secret	,	kind	of	,	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 	in	dough	that	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	out	flavor	.
it	 start 	 s 	 	to	 re 	 lease 	 	the	 sugar 	 s 	 	trapped	in	the	starch	.
that	's	what	 enzyme 	 s 	 	are	 do 	 ing 	 	.
and	so	,	if	we	can	 re 	 lease 	 	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	,	they	 be 	 come 	 	 access 	 ible 	 	to	us	in	our	 pal 	 ate 	 	.
they	 be 	 come 	 	 access 	 ible 	 	to	the	 y 	 east 	 	 a 	 s 	 	food	.
they	 be 	 come 	 	 access 	 ible 	 	to	the	oven	for	 caramel 	 ization 	 	to	give	us	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	crust	.
the	other	pre	-	dough	that	we	make	is	 ferment 	 ed 	 	--	our	pre	-	ferment	.
and	it	's	made	--	it	can	be	a	 s 	 our 	 dough 	 	 start 	 er 	 	,	or	what	we	call	a	``	 big 	 a 	 	``	or	any	other	kind	of	pre	-	 ferment 	 ed 	 	dough	with	a	little	 y 	 east 	 	in	it	,
and	that	 start 	 s 	 	to	develop	flavor	 al 	 so 	 	.
and	on	day	two	,	we	put	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 piece 	 s 	 	together	.	that	's	the	 ep 	 oxy 	 	.
and	we	're	 hop 	 ing 	 	that	,	sort	of	,	the	enzyme	piece	of	dough	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	the	fuel	pack	for	the	 leaven 	 ed 	 	piece	of	dough	,
and	when	we	put	them	together	and	add	the	final	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	,	we	can	create	a	bread	that	 do 	 es 	 	evoke	the	full	potential	of	flavor	trapped	in	the	grain	.
that	's	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	,	now	,	what	we	--
in	the	journey	of	wheat	,	let	's	go	back	and	look	at	these	12	 stage 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	go	through	them	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	and	then	 re 	 visit 	 	them	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	we	're	going	to	start	with	the	first	stage	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	every	student	 ha 	 s 	 	to	begin	with	.
 every 	 one 	 	who	 work 	 s 	 	in	the	 cul 	 in 	 ary 	 	world	 know 	 s 	 	that	the	first	stage	of	 cook 	 ing 	 	is	``	mise	en	place	,	``
which	is	just	a	french	way	of	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	get	 organize 	 d 	 	.	``
 every 	 thing 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	place	.	first	stage	.
so	in	 ba 	 king 	 	we	call	it	 scal 	 ing 	 	--	 weigh 	 ing 	 	out	the	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	.
stage	two	is	 mix 	 ing 	 	.	we	take	the	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	and	we	mix	them	.
we	have	to	develop	the	 glut 	 en 	 	.
there	's	no	 glut 	 en 	 	in	flour	.	there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	the	potential	for	 glut 	 en 	 	.
here	's	 an 	 other 	 	kind	of	 pre 	 figur 	 ing 	 	of	 ep 	 oxy 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	've	got	 glut 	 en 	 in 	 	and	 glia 	 din 	 	,
 n 	 either 	 	of	which	are	strong	 en 	 ough 	 	to	make	a	good	bread	.	but	when	they	get	 hyd 	 rated 	 	and	they	bond	to	each	other	,	they	create	a	 strong 	 er 	 	molecule	,	a	 strong 	 er 	 	protein	we	call	 glut 	 en 	 	.
and	so	we	,	in	the	 mix 	 ing 	 	process	,	have	to	develop	the	 glut 	 en 	 	,	we	have	to	activate	the	leaven	or	the	 y 	 east 	 	,	and	we	have	to	 essential 	 ly 	 	 distribut 	 e 	 	all	the	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	 even 	 ly 	 	.
then	we	get	 in 	 to 	 	 ferment 	 ation 	 	,	the	third	stage	,	which	is	 re 	 ally 	 	where	the	flavor	 develop 	 s 	 	.
the	 y 	 east 	 	 come 	 s 	 	 al 	 ive 	 	and	 start 	 s 	 	eating	the	 sugar 	 s 	 	,	creating	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	and	alcohol	--
 essential 	 ly 	 	it	's	 bur 	 ping 	 	and	 sweat 	 ing 	 	,	which	is	what	bread	is	.	it	's	 y 	 east 	 	 bur 	 ps 	 	and	sweat	.
and	 some 	 how 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 transform 	 ed 	 	--	the	 y 	 east 	 	 bur 	 ps 	 	and	 sweat 	 s 	 	are	 lat 	 er 	 	 transform 	 ed 	 	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	to	the	heart	of	what	 make 	 s 	 	bread	so	special	is	that	it	is	a	 transform 	 ation 	 al 	 	food	,
and	we	're	going	to	explore	that	in	a	minute	.	but	then	,	 quick 	 ly 	 	through	the	next	few	 stage 	 s 	 	.
we	,	after	it	's	 ferment 	 ed 	 	and	it	's	 develop 	 ed 	 	,	 start 	 ed 	 	to	develop	flavor	and	character	,	we	divide	it	 in 	 to 	 	 small 	 er 	 	 unit 	 s 	 	.
and	then	we	take	 t 	 hose 	 	 unit 	 s 	 	and	we	shape	them	.	we	give	them	a	little	pre	-	shape	,	 usual 	 ly 	 	a	round	or	a	little	torpedo	shape	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	.
that	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 round 	 ing 	 	.	``
and	there	's	a	short	rest	period	.	it	can	be	for	a	few	 second 	 s 	 	.
it	can	be	for	20	or	30	 minute 	 s 	 	.	we	call	that	 rest 	 ing 	 	or	 bench 	 ing 	 	.
then	we	go	 in 	 to 	 	final	 sha 	 ping 	 	,	``	 pan 	 ning 	 	``	--	which	 mean 	 s 	 	 put 	 ting 	 	the	shaped	loaf	on	a	pan	.
 th 	 is 	 	 take 	 s 	 	a	second	,	but	it	's	a	 distinct 	 ive 	 	stage	.
it	can	be	in	a	basket	.	it	can	be	in	a	loaf	pan	,	but	we	pan	it	.
and	then	,	stage	nine	.
the	 ferment 	 ation 	 	which	 start 	 ed 	 	at	stage	three	is	 continu 	 ing 	 	through	all	these	other	 stage 	 s 	 	.	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 develop 	 ing 	 	more	flavor	.
the	final	 ferment 	 ation 	 	 take 	 s 	 	place	in	stage	nine	.
we	call	it	``	 proof 	 ing 	 	.	``
 proof 	 ing 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	to	prove	that	the	dough	is	 al 	 ive 	 	.
and	at	stage	nine	we	get	the	dough	to	the	final	shape	,	and	it	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	oven	--	stage	10	.
three	 transform 	 ations 	 	take	place	in	the	oven	.
the	 sugar 	 s 	 	in	the	dough	 caramel 	 ize 	 	in	the	crust	.
they	give	us	that	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 brow 	 n 	 	crust	.
 on 	 ly 	 	the	crust	can	 caramel 	 ize 	 	.	it	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	place	that	 get 	 s 	 	hot	 en 	 ough 	 	.
 in 	 side 	 	,	the	 protein 	 s 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	 glut 	 en 	 	--	 coagul 	 ates 	 	.
when	it	 get 	 s 	 	to	about	160	 degree 	 s 	 	,	the	 protein 	 s 	 	all	line	up	and	they	create	structure	,	the	 glut 	 en 	 	structure	--	what	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	we	will	call	the	crumb	of	the	bread	.
and	the	 starch 	 es 	 	,	when	they	reach	about	180	 degree 	 s 	 	,	 gelatin 	 ize 	 	.
and	 gelatin 	 ization 	 	is	yet	 an 	 other 	 	oven	 transform 	 ation 	 	.
coagulation	,	 caramel 	 ization 	 	and	 gelatin 	 ization 	 	--
when	the	starch	is	thick	and	they	absorb	all	the	 moist 	 ure 	 	that	's	around	them	,	they	--	they	kind	of	 s 	 well 	 	,	and	then	they	burst	.
and	they	burst	,	and	they	 s 	 pill 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 gut 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	bread	.
so	 bas 	 ically 	 	now	we	're	eating	 y 	 east 	 	 sweat 	 s 	 	--	sweat	,	 bur 	 ps 	 	and	starch	 gut 	 s 	 	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	 transform 	 ed 	 	in	stage	10	in	the	oven	 be 	 cause 	 	what	went	 in 	 to 	 	the	oven	 a 	 s 	 	dough	 come 	 s 	 	out	in	stage	11	 a 	 s 	 	bread	.
and	stage	11	,	we	call	it	 cool 	 ing 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	we	never	 re 	 ally 	 	eat	the	bread	right	away	.
there	's	a	little	carry	-	over	 ba 	 king 	 	.
the	 protein 	 s 	 	have	to	set	up	,	 strength 	 en 	 	and	firm	up	.
and	then	we	have	stage	12	,	which	the	 text 	 book 	 s 	 	call	``	 pack 	 aging 	 	,	``	but	my	 student 	 s 	 	call	``	eating	.	``
and	so	,	we	're	going	to	be	on	our	own	journey	 to 	 day 	 	from	wheat	to	eat	,	and	in	a	few	 minute 	 s 	 	we	will	try	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	see	if	we	have	 succeed 	 ed 	 	in	 fulfill 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 bake 	 r 	 	's	mission	of	 pull 	 ing 	 	out	flavor	.
but	i	want	to	go	back	now	and	 re 	 visit 	 	these	 step 	 s 	 	,	and	talk	about	it	from	the	 stand 	 point 	 	of	 transform 	 ation 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	all	 thing 	 s 	 	can	be	 under 	 stood 	 	--
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	my	own	idea	.	 th 	 is 	 	 go 	 es 	 	back	to	the	scholastics	and	to	the	 ancient 	 s 	 	--	that	all	 thing 	 s 	 	can	be	 under 	 stood 	 	on	four	 level 	 s 	 	:	the	 liter 	 al 	 	,	the	 metaphor 	 ic 	 	or	 poet 	 ic 	 	level	,	the	 politic 	 al 	 	or	 ethic 	 al 	 	level	.	and	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	the	 mystic 	 al 	 	or	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	``	 ana 	 go 	 gical 	 	``	level	.
it	's	hard	to	get	to	 t 	 hose 	 	 level 	 s 	 	 un 	 less 	 	you	go	through	the	 liter 	 al 	 	.
in	fact	,	dante	 say 	 s 	 	you	ca	n't	understand	the	three	 deep 	 er 	 	 level 	 s 	 	 un 	 less 	 	you	first	understand	the	 liter 	 al 	 	level	,
so	that	's	why	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	about	bread	.
from	the	 stand 	 point 	 	of	 connect 	 ions 	 	to	possibly	a	 deep 	 er 	 	level	--	all	in	my	quest	for	 answer 	 ing 	 	the	question	,	``	what	is	it	about	bread	that	's	so	special	?	``
and	 fulfill 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	mission	of	 evo 	 king 	 	the	full	potential	of	flavor	.
 be 	 cause 	 	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	,	bread	 begin 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	wheat	or	any	other	grain	.
but	what	's	wheat	?	wheat	is	a	grass	that	 grow 	 s 	 	in	the	field	.
and	,	like	all	 grass 	 es 	 	,	at	a	certain	point	it	 put 	 s 	 	out	 seed 	 s 	 	.
and	we	harvest	 t 	 hose 	 	 seed 	 s 	 	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	wheat	 ker 	 nel 	 s 	 	.
now	,	in	order	to	harvest	it	--	i	mean	,	what	's	 harvest 	 ing 	 	?
it	's	just	a	 euphem 	 ism 	 	for	 kill 	 ing 	 	,	right	?
i	mean	,	that	's	what	's	harvest	--	we	say	we	harvest	the	pig	,	you	know	?
 y 	 es 	 	,	we	 s 	 laughter 	 	,	you	know	.	 y 	 es 	 	,	that	's	life	.
we	harvest	the	wheat	,	and	in	 harvest 	 ing 	 	it	,	we	kill	it	.
now	,	wheat	is	 al 	 ive 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	we	harvest	it	,	it	 give 	 s 	 	up	 it 	 s 	 	 seed 	 s 	 	.
now	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	with	 seed 	 s 	 	we	have	the	potential	for	future	life	.
we	can	plant	 t 	 hose 	 	in	the	ground	.	and	we	 s 	 ave 	 	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	for	the	next	generation	.
but	most	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 seed 	 s 	 	get	 crush 	 ed 	 	and	 turn 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	flour	.
and	at	that	point	,	the	wheat	 ha 	 s 	 	 suffer 	 ed 	 	the	ultimate	 in 	 dignity 	 	.
it	's	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 kill 	 ed 	 	,	but	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 deni 	 ed 	 	any	potential	for	creating	future	life	.
so	we	turn	it	 in 	 to 	 	flour	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	i	think	bread	is	a	 transform 	 ation 	 al 	 	food	.
the	first	 transform 	 ation 	 	--	and	,	by	the	way	,	the	definition	of	 transform 	 ation 	 	for	me	is	a	radical	change	from	one	thing	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
o.k	.	?	radical	,	not	subtle	.
not	like	hot	water	made	cold	,	or	cold	water	 turn 	 ed 	 	hot	,	but	water	 boil 	 ed 	 	off	and	 be 	 coming 	 	 s 	 team 	 	.
that	's	a	 transform 	 ation 	 	,	two	different	 thing 	 s 	 	.
well	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	the	first	 transform 	 ation 	 	is	 al 	 ive 	 	to	dead	.
i	'd	call	that	radical	.
so	,	we	've	got	now	 th 	 is 	 	flour	.
and	what	do	we	do	?	we	add	some	water	.
in	stage	one	,	we	weigh	it	.
in	stage	two	,	we	add	water	and	salt	to	it	,	mix	it	together	,	and	we	create	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	call	``	clay	.	``
it	's	like	clay	.
and	we	 in 	 fuse 	 	that	clay	with	an	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 	that	we	call	``	leaven	.	``
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	it	's	 y 	 east 	 	,	but	 y 	 east 	 	is	leaven	.	what	 do 	 es 	 	leaven	mean	?
leaven	 come 	 s 	 	from	the	root	word	that	 mean 	 s 	 	enliven	--	to	 viv 	 ify 	 	,	to	 br 	 ing 	 	to	life	.
by	the	way	,	what	's	the	hebrew	word	for	clay	?	adam	.
you	see	,	the	 bake 	 r 	 	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	moment	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	,	in	a	sense	,	sort	of	,	the	god	of	his	dough	,	you	know	,	and	his	dough	,	well	,	while	it	's	not	an	intelligent	life	form	,	is	now	 al 	 ive 	 	.
and	we	know	it	's	 al 	 ive 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	in	stage	three	,	it	 grow 	 s 	 	.	growth	is	the	proof	of	life	.
and	while	it	's	growing	,	all	these	 liter 	 al 	 	 transform 	 ations 	 	are	taking	place	.
 enzyme 	 s 	 	are	 break 	 ing 	 	forth	 sugar 	 s 	 	.
 y 	 east 	 	is	eating	sugar	and	 turn 	 ing 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	and	alcohol	.
bacteria	is	in	there	,	eating	the	same	 sugar 	 s 	 	,	 turn 	 ing 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	 acid 	 s 	 	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	 personal 	 ity 	 	and	character	's	 be 	 ing 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	dough	under	the	 watch 	 ful 	 	 gaz 	 e 	 	of	the	 bake 	 r 	 	.
and	the	 bake 	 r 	 	's	 choice 	 s 	 	all	 a 	 long 	 	the	way	determine	the	 out 	 come 	 	of	the	product	.
a	subtle	change	in	temperature	--	a	subtle	change	in	time	--	it	's	all	about	a	 balanc 	 ing 	 	act	between	time	,	temperature	and	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	.	that	's	the	art	of	 ba 	 king 	 	.
so	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 determine 	 d 	 	by	the	 bake 	 r 	 	,	and	the	bread	 go 	 es 	 	through	some	 stage 	 s 	 	,	and	 character 	 s 	 	develop	.
and	then	we	divide	it	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	one	big	piece	of	dough	is	 divid 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 small 	 er 	 	 unit 	 s 	 	,	and	each	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 unit 	 s 	 	are	 give 	 n 	 	shape	by	the	 bake 	 r 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	they	're	shaped	,	they	're	raised	 aga 	 in 	 	,	all	 a 	 long 	 	 prov 	 ing 	 	that	they	're	 al 	 ive 	 	,	and	 develop 	 ing 	 	character	.
and	at	stage	10	,	we	take	it	to	the	oven	.
it	's	still	dough	.	 no 	 body 	 	eats	bread	dough	--
a	few	people	do	,	i	think	,	but	not	too	 man 	 y 	 	.
i	've	met	some	dough	 eater 	 s 	 	,	but	--	it	's	not	the	staff	of	life	,	right	?	bread	is	the	staff	of	life	.
but	dough	is	what	we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	with	,	and	we	take	that	dough	to	the	oven	,
and	it	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	oven	.	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	the	 in 	 terior 	 	temperature	of	that	dough	 cross 	 es 	 	the	threshold	of	140	 degree 	 s 	 	,	it	 pass 	 es 	 	what	we	call	the	``	thermal	death	point	.	``
 student 	 s 	 	love	that	tdp	.	they	think	it	's	the	name	of	a	video	game	.	but	it	's	the	thermal	death	point	--	all	life	 cease 	 s 	 	there	.
the	 y 	 east 	 	,	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	mission	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	up	till	now	to	raise	the	dough	,	to	enliven	it	,	to	 viv 	 ify 	 	it	,	in	order	to	complete	 it 	 s 	 	mission	,	which	is	 al 	 so 	 	to	turn	 th 	 is 	 	dough	 in 	 to 	 	bread	,	 ha 	 s 	 	to	give	up	 it 	 s 	 	life	.
so	you	see	the	 symbol 	 ism 	 	at	work	?	it	's	 start 	 ing 	 	to	come	forth	a	little	bit	,	you	know	.
it	's	 start 	 ing 	 	to	make	sense	to	me	--	what	 go 	 es 	 	in	is	dough	,	what	 come 	 s 	 	out	is	bread	--	or	it	 go 	 es 	 	in	 al 	 ive 	 	,	 come 	 s 	 	out	dead	.
third	 transform 	 ation 	 	.	first	 transform 	 ation 	 	,	 al 	 ive 	 	to	dead	.
second	 transform 	 ation 	 	,	dead	 br 	 ought 	 	back	to	life	.
third	 transform 	 ation 	 	,	 al 	 ive 	 	to	dead	--
but	dough	to	bread	.
or	 an 	 other 	 	 analog 	 y 	 	would	be	,	a	 cater 	 pillar 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 butter 	 fly 	 	.
and	it	's	what	 come 	 s 	 	out	of	the	oven	that	is	what	we	call	the	staff	of	life	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	product	that	 every 	 one 	 	in	the	world	eats	,	that	is	so	difficult	to	give	up	.
it	's	so	 deep 	 ly 	 	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	in	our	 psych 	 es 	 	that	bread	is	used	 a 	 s 	 	a	symbol	for	life	.
it	's	used	 a 	 s 	 	a	symbol	for	 transform 	 ation 	 	.
and	so	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	get	to	stage	12	and	we	 par 	 take 	 	of	that	,	 aga 	 in 	 	 comple 	 ting 	 	the	life	cycle	,	you	know	,	we	have	a	chance	to	 essential 	 ly 	 	 ing 	 est 	 	that	--
it	 nurture 	 s 	 	us	,	and	we	 continu 	 e 	 	to	carry	on	and	have	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	to	ponder	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	bread	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	bread	 ha 	 s 	 	taught	me	in	my	journey	.
and	what	we	're	going	to	attempt	to	do	with	 th 	 is 	 	bread	here	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	is	to	use	,	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	 every 	 thing 	 	we	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	,	 th 	 is 	 	bread	we	're	going	to	call	``	 s 	 pent 	 	grain	bread	``	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	know	,	bread	-	making	is	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	to	beer	-	making	.
beer	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	liquid	bread	,	or	bread	is	solid	beer	.
and	--
they	--	they	're	 invent 	 ed 	 	around	the	same	time	.	i	think	beer	came	first	.
and	the	egyptian	who	was	 tend 	 ing 	 	the	beer	fell	 a 	 sleep 	 	in	the	hot	,	egyptian	 s 	 un 	 	,	and	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	bread	.
but	we	've	got	 th 	 is 	 	bread	,	and	what	i	did	here	is	to	try	to	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	evoke	even	more	flavor	from	 th 	 is 	 	grain	,	was	we	've	 add 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	it	the	 s 	 pent 	 	grain	from	beer	-	making	.
and	if	you	make	 th 	 is 	 	bread	,	you	can	use	any	kind	of	 s 	 pent 	 	grain	from	any	type	of	beer	.
i	like	dark	 s 	 pent 	 	grain	.	 to 	 day 	 	we	're	using	a	light	 s 	 pent 	 	grain	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	from	,	like	,	some	kind	of	a	 lag 	 er 	 	of	some	sort	--	a	light	 lag 	 er 	 	or	an	 al 	 e 	 	--	that	is	wheat	and	 bar 	 ley 	 	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	 toast 	 ed 	 	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	the	beer	-	maker	 know 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	how	to	evoke	flavor	from	the	 grain 	 s 	 	by	using	 sprout 	 ing 	 	and	 mal 	 ting 	 	and	 roast 	 ing 	 	.
we	're	going	to	take	some	of	that	,	and	put	it	 in 	 to 	 	the	bread	.
so	now	we	not	 on 	 ly 	 	have	a	high	-	fiber	bread	,	but	now	fiber	on	top	of	fiber	.	and	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 hope 	 fully 	 	not	 on 	 ly 	 	a	 health 	 y 	 	bread	,	but	a	bread	that	you	will	enjoy	.
so	,	if	i	,	kind	of	,	break	 th 	 is 	 	bread	,	 may 	 be 	 	we	can	share	 th 	 is 	 	now	a	little	bit	here	.
we	'll	start	a	little	piece	here	,
and	i	'm	going	to	take	a	little	piece	here	--
i	think	i	'd	better	taste	it	 my 	 self 	 	before	you	have	it	at	lunch	.
i	'll	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	what	i	call	the	 bake 	 r 	 	's	 bless 	 ing 	 	.
may	your	crust	be	crisp	,	and	your	bread	 al 	 ways 	 	rise	.
thank	you	.
