thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
i	have	a	few	 picture 	 s 	 	,	and	i	'll	talk	a	little	bit	about	how	i	'm	able	to	do	what	i	do	.
all	these	 house 	 s 	 	are	built	from	between	70	and	80	percent	 recycl 	 ed 	 	material	,	stuff	that	was	headed	to	the	 mulch 	 er 	 	,	the	 land 	 fill 	 	,	the	burn	pile	.
it	was	all	just	gone	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	house	i	built	.
 th 	 is 	 	double	front	door	here	with	the	three	-	light	 trans 	 om 	 	that	was	headed	to	the	 land 	 fill 	 	.
have	a	little	 tur 	 ret 	 	there	.
and	then	these	 button 	 s 	 	on	the	 cor 	 bel 	 s 	 	here	.	right	there	--	 t 	 hose 	 	are	 hick 	 ory 	 	nuts	.
and	these	 button 	 s 	 	there	--	 t 	 hose 	 	are	chicken	 egg 	 s 	 	.
of	course	,	first	you	have	 break 	 fast 	 	,	and	then	you	fill	the	shell	full	of	bondo	and	paint	it	and	nail	it	up	,	and	you	have	an	 architect 	 ural 	 	button	in	just	a	fraction	of	the	time	.
then	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	look	at	the	 in 	 side 	 	.
you	can	see	the	three	-	light	 trans 	 om 	 	there	with	the	 eye 	 brow 	 	 window 	 s 	 	--	 certain 	 ly 	 	an	 architect 	 ural 	 	 anti 	 que 	 
headed	to	the	 land 	 fill 	 	.
even	the	 lock 	 set 	 	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	worth	200	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
 every 	 thing 	 	in	the	kitchen	was	 salv 	 aged 	 	.
there	's	a	1952	o'keefe	&	merritt	stove	,	if	you	like	to	cook	--	cool	stove	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	going	up	 in 	 to 	 	the	 tur 	 ret 	 	.
i	got	that	 stair 	 case 	 	for	20	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 deliver 	 y 	 	to	my	lot	.
then	,	looking	up	in	the	 tur 	 ret 	 	,	you	see	there	are	 bulg 	 es 	 	and	 poke 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 ag 	 s 	 	and	so	forth	.
well	,	if	that	 ruin 	 s 	 	your	life	,	well	then	you	should	n't	live	there	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 laundr 	 y 	 	chute	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	right	here	is	a	shoe	last	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	are	 t 	 hose 	 	cast	-	iron	 thing 	 s 	 	you	see	at	 anti 	 que 	 	 shop 	 s 	 	.
so	i	had	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	,	so	i	made	some	low	-	tech	 gadget 	 ry 	 	,	there	,	where	you	just	 s 	 to 	 mp 	 	on	the	shoe	last	and	then	the	door	flies	open	,	you	throw	your	 laundr 	 y 	 	down	.
and	then	if	you	're	smart	 en 	 ough 	 	,	it	 go 	 es 	 	on	a	basket	on	top	of	the	 wash 	 er 	 	.
if	not	,	it	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	toilet	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 bath 	 tub 	 	i	made	,	made	out	of	scrap	two	-	by	-	four	here	.
 start 	 ed 	 	with	a	rim	there	and	then	 glu 	 ed 	 	and	 nail 	 ed 	 	it	up	 in 	 to 	 	a	flat	,	 cor 	 bell 	 ed 	 	it	up	and	 flip 	 ped 	 	it	over	,	then	did	the	two	 profile 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	side	.
it	's	a	two	-	person	tub	.
after	all	,	it	's	not	just	a	question	of	 hygien 	 e 	 	,	but	there	's	a	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	 re 	 creation 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
then	,	 th 	 is 	 	faucet	here	is	just	a	piece	of	osage	 o 	 range 	 	.
it	 look 	 s 	 	a	little	 phal 	 lic 	 	,	but	after	all	,	it	's	a	 bath 	 room 	 	.
then	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	house	based	on	a	budweiser	can	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	look	like	a	can	of	beer	,	but	the	design	take	-	offs	are	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 un 	 mistak 	 able 	 	.
the	 bar 	 ley 	 	 hop 	 s 	 	design	 work 	 ed 	 	up	 in 	 to 	 	the	eaves	,	then	the	 dent 	 il 	 	work	 come 	 s 	 	 direct 	 ly 	 	off	the	can	's	red	,	white	,	blue	and	silver	.
then	,	these	 cor 	 bel 	 es 	 	going	down	 under 	 neath 	 	the	eaves	are	that	little	design	that	 come 	 s 	 	off	the	can	.
i	just	put	a	can	on	a	 cop 	 ier 	 	and	 ke 	 pt 	 	 enlarg 	 ing 	 	it	 un 	 til 	 	i	got	the	 s 	 ize 	 	i	want	.
then	,	on	the	can	it	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	famous	budweiser	beer	,	we	know	of	no	other	beer	,	 bl 	 ah 	 	,	 bl 	 ah 	 	,	 bl 	 ah 	 	.	``
so	we	 change 	 d 	 	that	and	put	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	famous	budweiser	house	.
we	do	n't	know	of	any	other	house	,	``	and	so	forth	and	so	on	.
then	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 dead 	 bolt 	 	.	it	's	a	 f 	 ence 	 	from	a	1930s	 sha 	 per 	 	,
which	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 ang 	 ry 	 	 wood 	 work 	 ing 	 	machine	.
and	they	 g 	 ave 	 	me	the	 f 	 ence 	 	,	but	they	did	n't	give	me	the	 sha 	 per 	 	,	so	we	made	a	 dead 	 bolt 	 	out	of	it	.
that	'll	keep	bull	 elephant 	 s 	 	out	,	i	promise	.
and	 s 	 ure 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	we	've	had	no	 problem 	 s 	 	with	bull	 elephant 	 s 	 	.
the	shower	is	 intend 	 ed 	 	to	 simul 	 ate 	 	a	glass	of	beer	.
we	've	got	 bubble 	 s 	 	going	up	there	,	then	 s 	 ud 	 s 	 	at	the	top	with	 lump 	 y 	 	 tile 	 s 	 	.
where	do	you	get	 lump 	 y 	 	 tile 	 s 	 	?	well	,	of	course	,	you	do	n't	.
but	i	get	a	lot	of	 toilet 	 s 	 	,	and	so	you	just	 dis 	 patch 	 	a	toilet	with	a	hammer	,	and	then	you	have	 lump 	 y 	 	 tile 	 s 	 	.
and	then	the	faucet	,	there	,	is	a	beer	tap	.
then	,	 th 	 is 	 	 pan 	 el 	 	of	glass	is	the	same	 pan 	 el 	 	of	glass	that	 occur 	 s 	 	in	every	middle	-	class	front	door	in	america	.
we	're	 get 	 ting 	 	 tire 	 d 	 	of	it	.	it	's	kind	of	 cliche 	 d 	 	now	.
so	if	you	put	it	in	the	front	door	,	your	design	 fail 	 s 	 	.
so	do	n't	put	it	in	the	front	door	;	put	it	 some 	 where 	 	else	.
it	's	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	 pan 	 el 	 	of	glass	.	but	then	if	you	put	it	in	the	front	door	,	people	say	,	``	oh	,	you	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	be	like	 t 	 hose 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	,	and	you	did	n't	make	it	.	``
so	do	n't	put	it	there	.
then	,	 an 	 other 	 	 bath 	 room 	 	 up 	 stair 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	light	up	here	is	the	same	light	that	 occur 	 s 	 	in	every	middle	-	class	foyer	in	america	.
do	n't	put	it	in	the	foyer	.
put	it	in	the	shower	,	or	in	the	 close 	 t 	 	,	but	not	in	the	foyer	.
then	,	 some 	 body 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	me	a	 bid 	 et 	 	,	so	it	got	a	 bid 	 et 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	little	house	here	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 branch 	 es 	 	there	are	made	out	of	bois	d'arc	or	osage	 o 	 range 	 	,
and	these	 picture 	 s 	 	will	keep	 scroll 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	i	talk	a	little	bit	.
in	order	to	do	what	i	do	,	you	have	to	understand	what	 cause 	 s 	 	waste	in	the	building	industry	.
our	housing	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	a	 commodit 	 y 	 	,	and	i	'll	talk	a	little	bit	about	that	.
but	the	first	cause	of	waste	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	even	buried	in	our	dna	.
human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	have	a	need	for	 maintain 	 ing 	 	 consist 	 ency 	 	of	the	 ap 	 perceptive 	 	mass	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	?
what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	is	,	for	every	 per 	 ception 	 	we	have	,	it	 need 	 s 	 	to	 t 	 ally 	 	with	the	one	like	it	before	,	or	we	do	n't	have	 continu 	 ity 	 	,	and	we	 be 	 come 	 	a	little	bit	 dis 	 oriented 	 	.
so	i	can	show	you	an	object	you	've	never	 s 	 een 	 	before	.
oh	,	that	's	a	cell	phone	.
but	you	've	never	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	one	before	.
what	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	is	 s 	 izing 	 	up	the	pattern	of	structural	 feature 	 s 	 	here	,	and	then	you	go	through	your	 data 	 bank 	 s 	 	--	brrrr	,	cell	phone	.
oh	,	that	's	a	cell	phone	.
if	i	took	a	bite	out	of	it	,	you	'd	go	,	``	wait	a	second	.
that	's	not	a	cell	phone	.
that	's	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	new	chocolate	cell	 phone 	 s 	 	.	``
and	you	'd	have	to	start	a	new	 categor 	 y 	 	,	right	between	cell	 phone 	 s 	 	and	chocolate	.
that	's	how	we	process	information	.
so	you	 transl 	 ate 	 	that	to	the	building	industry	,
if	we	have	a	wall	of	 window 	 pane 	 s 	 	and	one	pane	is	 crack 	 ed 	 	,	we	go	,	``	oh	,	dear	.	that	's	 crack 	 ed 	 	.	let	's	repair	it	.
let	's	take	it	out	.	throw	it	away	so	 no 	 body 	 	can	use	it	and	put	a	new	one	in	.	``
 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	what	you	do	with	a	 crack 	 ed 	 	pane	.
never	mind	that	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	affect	our	 live 	 s 	 	at	all	.
it	 on 	 ly 	 	 rattle 	 s 	 	that	 expect 	 ed 	 	pattern	and	 un 	 ity 	 	of	structural	 feature 	 s 	 	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	if	we	took	a	small	hammer	,	and	we	 add 	 ed 	 	 crack 	 s 	 	to	all	the	other	 window 	 s 	 	,	then	we	have	a	pattern	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 gest 	 alt 	 	 psycho 	 logy 	 	 emphas 	 ize 	 s 	 	 re 	 cognition 	 	of	pattern	over	 part 	 s 	 	that	 com 	 prise 	 	a	pattern	.
we	'll	go	,	``	ooh	,	that	's	nice	.	``
so	,	that	 serve 	 s 	 	me	every	day	.
 re 	 petition 	 	 create 	 s 	 	pattern	.
if	i	have	a	hundred	of	these	,	a	hundred	of	 t 	 hose 	 	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	any	 differ 	 ence 	 	what	these	and	 t 	 hose 	 	are	.
if	i	can	repeat	 any 	 thing 	 	,	i	have	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	a	pattern	from	 hick 	 ory 	 	nuts	and	chicken	 egg 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 hard 	 s 	 	of	glass	,	 branch 	 es 	 	.	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	any	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
that	 cause 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	waste	in	the	building	industry	.
second	is	,	friedrich	nietzsche	 a 	 long 	 	about	1885	wrote	a	book	titled	``	the	birth	of	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	.	``
and	in	there	he	 s 	 aid 	 	that	 culture 	 s 	 	tend	to	 s 	 wing 	 	between	one	of	two	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 s 	 	.
on	the	one	hand	,	we	have	an	apollonian	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	which	is	 ver 	 y 	 	crisp	and	 pre 	 meditate 	 d 	 	and	 intellectual 	 ized 	 	and	perfect	.
on	the	other	end	of	the	spectrum	,	we	have	a	dionysian	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	which	is	more	 give 	 n 	 	to	the	 pass 	 ions 	 	and	 intuit 	 ion 	 	,	 toler 	 ant 	 	of	 organ 	 ic 	 	 text 	 ure 	 	and	human	 gest 	 ure 	 	.
so	the	way	the	apollonian	 personal 	 ity 	 	 take 	 s 	 	a	picture	,	or	 hang 	 s 	 	a	picture	,	is	they	'll	get	out	a	transit	and	a	laser	level	and	a	 micro 	 meter 	 	.
``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	honey	.	a	 thousand 	 th 	 	of	an	inch	to	the	left	.
that	's	where	we	want	the	picture	.	right	.	perfect	.	``
 pre 	 dica 	 ted 	 	on	plumb	level	,	square	and	 center 	 ed 	 	.
the	dionysian	 personal 	 ity 	 	 take 	 s 	 	the	picture	and	 go 	 es 	 	...
that	's	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
i	feature	 ble 	 mis 	 h 	 	.
i	feature	 organ 	 ic 	 	process	.
dead	-	center	john	dewey	.	apollonian	 mind 	 set 	 	 create 	 s 	 	 mountain 	 s 	 	of	waste	.
if	 some 	 thing 	 	is	n't	perfect	,	if	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	line	up	with	that	 pre 	 meditate 	 d 	 	model	,	 dump 	 ster 	 	.
``	 oop 	 s 	 	,	scratch	,	 dump 	 ster 	 	.	``
``	 oop 	 s 	 	``	 th 	 is 	 	,	``	 oop 	 s 	 	``	that	.	``	 land 	 fill 	 	.	 land 	 fill 	 	.	 land 	 fill 	 	.	``
the	third	thing	is	 argu 	 ably 	 	--
the	industrial	revolution	 start 	 ed 	 	in	the	 ren 	 aiss 	 ance 	 	with	the	rise	of	 human 	 ism 	 	,	then	got	a	little	jump	-	start	 a 	 long 	 	about	the	french	revolution	.
by	the	middle	of	the	19th	century	,	it	's	in	full	flower	.	and	we	have	 dumafl 	 age 	 s 	 	and	 gizmo 	 s 	 	and	 contraption 	 s 	 	that	will	do	 any 	 thing 	 	that	we	,	up	to	that	point	,	had	to	do	my	hand	.	so	now	we	have	 standard 	 ized 	 	 material 	 s 	 	.
well	,	 tree 	 s 	 	do	n't	grow	two	 inch 	 es 	 	by	four	 inch 	 es 	 	,	eight	,	ten	and	twelve	feet	tall	.
we	create	 mountain 	 s 	 	of	waste	.
and	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	job	there	in	the	forest	,	 work 	 ing 	 	all	the	 by 	 product 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	industry	--	with	osb	and	particle	board	and	so	forth	and	so	on	--	but	it	 do 	 es 	 	no	good	to	be	 respons 	 ible 	 	at	the	point	of	harvest	in	the	forest	if	 consumer 	 s 	 	are	 was 	 ting 	 	the	harvest	at	the	point	of	consumption	,	and	that	's	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
and	so	if	 some 	 thing 	 	is	n't	standard	,	``	 oop 	 s 	 	,	 dump 	 ster 	 	.	``	``	 oop 	 s 	 	``	 th 	 is 	 	.	``	 oop 	 s 	 	,	 warp 	 ed 	 	.	``
if	you	buy	a	two	-	by	-	four	and	it	's	not	straight	,	you	can	take	it	back	.
``	oh	,	i	'm	so	sorry	,	 s 	 ir 	 	.	we	'll	get	you	a	straight	one	.	``
well	i	feature	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 warp 	 ed 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 re 	 petition 	 	 create 	 s 	 	pattern	,	and	it	's	from	a	dionysian	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	.
the	fourth	thing	is	labor	is	 dis 	 proportion 	 ate 	 ly 	 	more	expensive	than	 material 	 s 	 	.
well	,	that	's	just	a	myth	.
and	here	's	a	story	:	jim	tulles	,	one	of	the	 guy 	 s 	 	i	trained	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	jim	,	it	's	time	now	.
i	got	a	job	for	you	 a 	 s 	 	a	 fore 	 man 	 	on	a	framing	crew	.	it	's	time	for	you	to	go	.	``
``	dan	,	i	just	do	n't	think	i	'm	ready	.	``
``	jim	,	now	it	's	time	.	you	're	the	down	,	oh	.	``
so	we	 hire 	 d 	 	on	.
and	he	was	out	there	with	his	tape	measure	going	through	the	trash	heap	,	looking	for	 head 	 er 	 	material	,	which	is	the	board	that	 go 	 es 	 	over	a	door	,	 think 	 ing 	 	he	'd	impress	his	 bo 	 s 	 s 	 	--	that	's	how	we	taught	him	to	do	it	.
and	the	 super 	 intend 	 ent 	 	 walk 	 ed 	 	up	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	are	you	 do 	 ing 	 	?	``
``	oh	,	just	looking	for	some	 head 	 er 	 	material	,	``
 wait 	 ing 	 	for	that	kudos	.	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	no	.	i	'm	not	 pay 	 ing 	 	you	to	go	through	the	trash	.	get	back	to	work	.	``
and	he	had	the	 where 	 with 	 al 	 	to	say	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	,	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	 pay 	 ing 	 	me	300	 dollar 	 s 	 	an	hour	,	i	can	see	how	you	might	say	that	,	but	right	now	,	i	'm	saving	you	five	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	minute	.
do	the	math	.	``
``	good	call	,	tulles	.	from	now	on	,	you	 guy 	 s 	 	hit	 th 	 is 	 	pile	first	.	``
and	the	 iron 	 y 	 	is	that	he	was	n't	 ver 	 y 	 	good	at	math	.
but	once	in	a	while	you	get	access	to	the	control	room	,	and	then	you	can	kind	of	mess	with	the	 dial 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	there	.
the	fifth	thing	is	that	 may 	 be 	 	,	after	2,500	 year 	 s 	 	,	plato	is	still	 hav 	 ing 	 	his	way	with	us	in	his	 not 	 ion 	 	of	perfect	 form 	 s 	 	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	that	we	have	in	our	noggin	the	perfect	idea	of	what	we	want	,	and	we	force	 environment 	 al 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	to	 accommo 	 date 	 	that	.	so	we	all	have	in	our	head	the	perfect	house	,	the	american	dream	,	which	is	a	house	,	the	dream	house	.
the	problem	is	we	ca	n't	afford	it	.
so	we	have	the	american	dream	look	-	 a 	 like 	 	,	which	is	a	mobile	home	.
now	there	's	a	 b 	 light 	 	on	the	planet	.
it	's	a	 chat 	 tel 	 	mortgage	,	just	like	furniture	,	just	like	a	car	.
you	write	the	check	,	and	 instant 	 ly 	 	it	 depreciate 	 s 	 	30	percent	.
after	a	year	,	you	ca	n't	get	 insur 	 ance 	 	on	 every 	 thing 	 	you	have	in	it	,	 on 	 ly 	 	on	70	percent	.
wired	with	14	-	gauge	wire	 typical 	 ly 	 	.
 noth 	 ing 	 	wrong	with	that	,	 un 	 less 	 	you	ask	it	to	do	what	12	-	gauge	wire	's	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	do	,	and	that	's	what	 happen 	 s 	 	.
it	out	-	 gas 	 s 	 es 	 	 form 	 aldehyde 	 	so	much	so	that	there	is	a	federal	law	in	place	to	 war 	 n 	 	new	mobile	home	 buy 	 ers 	 	of	the	 form 	 aldehyde 	 	atmosphere	danger	.
are	we	just	 be 	 ing 	 	 numb 	 ing 	 ly 	 	stupid	?
the	 wall 	 s 	 	are	 th 	 is 	 	thick	.
the	whole	thing	 ha 	 s 	 	the	structural	value	of	corn	.
``	so	i	thought	palm	harbor	village	was	over	there	.	``
``	no	,	no	.	we	had	a	wind	last	night	.
it	's	gone	now	.	``
then	when	they	 de 	 grade 	 	,	what	do	you	do	with	them	?
now	,	all	that	,	that	apollonian	,	 plat 	 on 	 ic 	 	model	,	is	what	the	building	industry	is	 pre 	 dica 	 ted 	 	on	,	and	there	are	a	number	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	exacerbate	that	.
one	is	that	all	the	 professional 	 s 	 	,	all	the	 trade 	 s 	 men 	 	,	 vend 	 ors 	 	,	 inspect 	 ors 	 	,	 engineer 	 s 	 	,	 architect 	 s 	 	all	think	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	then	it	 work 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	way	back	to	the	consumer	,	who	 demand 	 s 	 	the	same	model	.
it	's	a	self	-	 fulfill 	 ing 	 	 prop 	 he 	 cy 	 	.	we	ca	n't	get	out	of	it	.
then	here	come	the	 market 	 e 	 ers 	 	and	the	 advertise 	 rs 	 	.
``	 wo 	 o 	 	.	woohooo	.	``
we	buy	stuff	we	did	n't	know	we	 need 	 ed 	 	.
all	we	have	to	do	is	look	at	what	one	company	did	with	 carbon 	 ated 	 	prune	juice	.
how	 disgust 	 ing 	 	.
but	you	know	what	they	did	?	they	 hook 	 ed 	 	a	metaphor	 in 	 to 	 	it	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	drink	dr.	pepper	.	.	.	``	and	 pre 	 tty 	 	soon	,	we	're	 s 	 will 	 ing 	 	that	stuff	by	the	lake	-	ful	,	by	the	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 gallon 	 s 	 	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	even	have	real	 prune 	 s 	 	.	 do 	 es 	 	n't	even	keep	you	regular	.
my	oh	my	,	that	 make 	 s 	 	it	 wo 	 rse 	 	.
and	we	get	 suck 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	that	 fast 	 er 	 	than	 any 	 thing 	 	.
then	a	man	named	jean	-	paul	sartre	wrote	a	book	titled	``	 be 	 ing 	 	and	 noth 	 ing 	 ness 	 	.	``
it	's	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	quick	read	.
you	can	snap	through	it	in	 may 	 be 	 	two	 year 	 s 	 	if	you	read	eight	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	.
in	there	he	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	the	 divid 	 ed 	 	self	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	act	 different 	 ly 	 	when	they	know	they	're	 al 	 one 	 	than	when	they	know	 some 	 body 	 	else	is	around	.
so	if	i	'm	eating	spaghetti	,	and	i	know	i	'm	 al 	 one 	 	,	i	can	eat	like	a	 back 	 hoe 	 	.
i	can	wipe	my	mouth	on	my	sleeve	,	napkin	on	the	table	,	chew	with	my	mouth	open	,	make	little	 noise 	 s 	 	,	scratch	 where 	 ver 	 	i	want	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	you	walk	in	,	i	go	,	``	ooh	.	spaghetti	sauce	there	.	``
napkin	in	my	lap	,	half	 bite 	 s 	 	,	chew	with	my	mouth	closed	,	no	 scratch 	 ing 	 	.
now	what	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	is	 fulfill 	 ing 	 	your	 expect 	 ations 	 	of	how	i	should	live	my	life	.
i	feel	that	 expect 	 ation 	 	,	and	so	i	 accommo 	 date 	 	it	,	and	i	'm	living	my	life	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	what	you	expect	me	to	do	.
that	 happen 	 s 	 	in	the	building	industry	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
that	's	why	all	of	our	 sub 	 division 	 s 	 	look	the	same	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	we	even	have	these	 form 	 al 	 ized 	 	cultural	 expect 	 ations 	 	.
i	'll	bet	all	your	 shoe 	 s 	 	match	.
 s 	 ure 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	we	all	buy	 in 	 to 	 	that	,	and	with	gated	 commun 	 ities 	 	,	we	have	a	 form 	 al 	 ized 	 	 expect 	 ation 	 	with	a	 home 	 owner 	 s 	 	 associ 	 ation 	 	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	are	nazis	,	my	oh	my	.
that	 exacerbate 	 s 	 	and	 continu 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	model	.
the	last	thing	is	 gregarious 	 ness 	 	.
human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	are	a	social	species	.
we	like	to	hang	together	in	 group 	 s 	 	,	just	like	 wild 	 e 	 be 	 est 	 s 	 	,	just	like	 lion 	 s 	 	.
 wild 	 e 	 be 	 est 	 s 	 	do	n't	hang	with	 lion 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 lion 	 s 	 	eat	 wild 	 e 	 be 	 est 	 s 	 	.
human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	are	like	that	.
we	do	what	that	group	 do 	 es 	 	that	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	identify	with	.
and	so	you	see	 th 	 is 	 	in	 juni 	 or 	 	high	a	lot	.
 t 	 hose 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	,	they	'll	work	all	summer	long	,	kill	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	so	that	they	can	afford	one	pair	of	 design 	 er 	 	 jean 	 s 	 	.	so	 a 	 long 	 	about	september	they	can	 strid 	 e 	 	in	and	go	,	``	i	'm	 import 	 ant 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
see	,	look	,	do	n't	touch	my	 design 	 er 	 	 jean 	 s 	 	.
i	see	you	do	n't	have	 design 	 er 	 	 jean 	 s 	 	.
you	're	not	one	of	the	 beaut 	 iful 	 	people	.
see	,	i	'm	one	of	the	 beaut 	 iful 	 	people	.	see	my	 jean 	 s 	 	?	``
right	there	is	reason	 en 	 ough 	 	to	have	 uniform 	 s 	 	.
and	so	that	 happen 	 s 	 	in	the	building	industry	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
we	have	 con 	 fused 	 	maslow	's	 hierarch 	 y 	 	of	 need 	 s 	 	just	a	little	bit	.
on	the	bottom	tier	we	have	 bas 	 ic 	 	 need 	 s 	 	--	shelter	,	 cloth 	 ing 	 	,	food	,	water	,	 mat 	 ing 	 	and	so	forth	.
second	,	security	.	third	,	 relationship 	 s 	 	.
fourth	,	 stat 	 us 	 	,	self	-	esteem	--	that	is	,	 van 	 ity 	 	.
and	we	're	taking	 van 	 ity 	 	and	 sh 	 ov 	 ing 	 	it	down	here	.
and	so	we	end	up	with	 va 	 in 	 	 decision 	 s 	 	and	we	ca	n't	even	afford	our	mortgage	.	we	ca	n't	even	afford	to	eat	 any 	 thing 	 	 ex 	 cept 	 	 bean 	 s 	 	.
that	is	,	our	housing	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	a	 commodit 	 y 	 	.	and	it	 take 	 s 	 	a	little	bit	of	nerve	to	 d 	 ive 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 prim 	 al 	 	,	 terrify 	 ing 	 	 part 	 s 	 	of	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	make	our	own	 decision 	 s 	 	and	not	make	our	housing	a	 commodit 	 y 	 	,	but	make	it	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 bubble 	 s 	 	up	from	 semi 	 nal 	 	 source 	 s 	 	.
that	 take 	 s 	 	a	little	bit	of	nerve	,	and	,	darn	it	,	once	in	a	while	you	fail	.
but	that	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
if	failure	 destroy 	 s 	 	you	,	then	you	ca	n't	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	fail	all	the	time	,	every	day	,
and	i	've	had	some	 who 	 pp 	 ing 	 	 failure 	 s 	 	,	i	promise	,	big	,	public	,	 humil 	 i 	 ating 	 	,	 embarrass 	 ing 	 	 failure 	 s 	 	.
 every 	 body 	 	 point 	 s 	 	and	 laugh 	 s 	 	,	and	they	say	,	``	he	 tri 	 ed 	 	it	a	fifth	time	and	it	still	did	n't	work	.
what	a	moron	.	``
early	on	,	 contract 	 ors 	 	come	by	and	say	,	``	dan	,	you	're	a	cute	little	 bun 	 ny 	 	,	but	you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	just	is	n't	going	to	work	.
what	do	n't	you	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	why	do	n't	you	do	that	?	``
and	your	instinct	is	to	say	,	``	why	do	n't	you	suck	an	egg	?	``
but	you	do	n't	say	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	the	 guy 	 s 	 	you	're	 target 	 ing 	 	.
and	so	what	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	just	in	housing	.	it	's	in	 cloth 	 ing 	 	and	food	and	our	 transport 	 ation 	 	 need 	 s 	 	,	our	energy	--	we	sprawl	just	a	little	bit	.
and	when	i	get	a	little	bit	of	press	,	i	hear	from	people	all	over	the	world	.
and	we	may	have	 invent 	 ed 	 	excess	,	but	the	problem	of	waste	is	 world 	 wide 	 	.
we	're	in	trouble	.
and	i	do	n't	wear	ammo	 belt 	 s 	 	 crisscross 	 ing 	 	my	chest	and	a	red	 band 	 ana 	 	,	but	we	're	 clear 	 ly 	 	in	trouble	.
and	what	we	need	to	do	is	 re 	 connect 	 	with	 t 	 hose 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 prim 	 al 	 	 part 	 s 	 	of	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	make	some	 decision 	 s 	 	and	say	,	``	you	know	,	i	think	i	would	like	to	put	cds	 a 	 cross 	 	the	wall	there	.
what	do	you	think	,	honey	?	``
if	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	,	take	it	down	.
what	we	need	to	do	is	 re 	 connect 	 	with	who	we	 re 	 ally 	 	are	,	and	that	's	 thrill 	 ing 	 	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
