i	was	 s 	 peaking 	 	to	a	group	of	about	300	 kid 	 s 	 	,	 age 	 s 	 	six	to	eight	,	at	a	children	's	museum	,	and	i	 br 	 ought 	 	with	me	a	bag	full	of	 leg 	 s 	 	,	similar	to	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	you	see	up	here	,	and	had	them	laid	out	on	a	table	for	the	 kid 	 s 	 	.
and	,	from	my	experience	,	you	know	,	 kid 	 s 	 	are	 natural 	 ly 	 	 cur 	 ious 	 	about	what	they	do	n't	know	,	or	do	n't	understand	,	or	is	foreign	to	them	.
they	 on 	 ly 	 	learn	to	be	 frighten 	 ed 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	when	an	adult	 influence 	 s 	 	them	to	 behav 	 e 	 	that	way	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	 censor 	 s 	 	that	natural	curiosity	,	or	you	know	,	 re 	 in 	 s 	 	in	the	question	-	 ask 	 ing 	 	in	the	 hope 	 s 	 	of	them	 be 	 ing 	 	polite	little	 kid 	 s 	 	.
so	i	just	 picture 	 d 	 	a	first	grade	teacher	out	in	the	lobby	with	these	 un 	 ru 	 ly 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	,	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	now	,	 what 	 ever 	 	you	do	,	do	n't	 star 	 e 	 	at	her	 leg 	 s 	 	.	``	but	,	of	course	,	that	's	the	point	.
that	's	why	i	was	there	,	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 invit 	 e 	 	them	to	look	and	explore	.
so	i	made	a	deal	with	the	 adult 	 s 	 	that	the	 kid 	 s 	 	could	come	in	 with 	 out 	 	any	 adult 	 s 	 	for	two	 minute 	 s 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	.
the	 door 	 s 	 	open	,	the	 kid 	 s 	 	descend	on	 th 	 is 	 	table	of	 leg 	 s 	 	,	and	they	are	 po 	 king 	 	and	 prodd 	 ing 	 	,	and	they	're	 wig 	 gling 	 	 to 	 es 	 	,	and	they	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	put	 the 	 ir 	 	full	weight	on	the	 s 	 print 	 ing 	 	leg	to	see	what	 happen 	 s 	 	with	that	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 kid 	 s 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	--	i	 wok 	 e 	 	up	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	i	 decide 	 d 	 	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	able	to	jump	over	a	house	--	 noth 	 ing 	 	too	big	,	two	or	three	 st 	 ories 	 	--	but	,	if	you	could	think	of	any	animal	,	any	 super 	 hero 	 	,	any	cartoon	character	,	 any 	 thing 	 	you	can	dream	up	right	now	,	what	kind	of	 leg 	 s 	 	would	you	build	me	?	``	and	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	a	voice	 shout 	 ed 	 	,	``	kangaroo	!	``	``	no	,	no	,	no	!	should	be	a	frog	!	``	``	no	.	it	should	be	go	go	gadget	!	``	``	no	,	no	,	no	!	it	should	be	the	incredibles	.	``	and	other	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	do	n't	--	are	n't	familiar	with	.
and	then	,	one	eight	-	year	-	old	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	why	would	n't	you	want	to	fly	too	?	``	and	the	whole	room	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	me	,	was	like	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	.	``	and	just	like	that	,	i	went	from	 be 	 ing 	 	a	woman	that	these	 kid 	 s 	 	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	trained	to	see	 a 	 s 	 	``	 dis 	 able 	 d 	 	``	to	 some 	 body 	 	that	had	potential	that	 the 	 ir 	 	bodies	did	n't	have	yet	.
 some 	 body 	 	that	might	even	be	super	-	abled	.
 interest 	 ing 	 	.
so	some	of	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	saw	me	at	ted	,	11	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.	and	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	lot	of	talk	about	how	life	-	changing	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	is	for	both	 speaker 	 s 	 	and	 attend 	 ees 	 	,	and	i	am	no	exception	.
ted	 liter 	 ally 	 	was	the	launch	pad	to	the	next	decade	of	my	life	's	exploration	.
at	the	time	,	the	 leg 	 s 	 	i	 present 	 ed 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 ground 	 break 	 ing 	 	in	 prost 	 hetic 	 s 	 	.
i	had	 wove 	 n 	 	carbon	fiber	 s 	 print 	 ing 	 	 leg 	 s 	 	 model 	 ed 	 	after	the	hind	leg	of	a	cheetah	,	which	you	may	have	 s 	 een 	 	on	stage	 yester 	 day 	 	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	these	 ver 	 y 	 	life	-	like	,	 intrinsic 	 ally 	 	 paint 	 ed 	 	 silicon 	 e 	 	 leg 	 s 	 	.
so	at	the	time	,	it	was	my	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	put	a	call	out	to	 innov 	 ators 	 	 out 	 side 	 	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	medical	 prost 	 hetic 	 	community	to	come	 br 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	talent	to	the	science	and	to	the	art	of	building	 leg 	 s 	 	.
so	that	we	can	stop	 compartment 	 al 	 izing 	 	form	,	function	and	aesthetic	,	and	 assign 	 ing 	 	them	different	 value 	 s 	 	.
well	,	 luck 	 y 	 	for	me	,	a	lot	of	people	 answer 	 ed 	 	that	call	.
and	the	journey	 start 	 ed 	 	,	funny	 en 	 ough 	 	,	with	a	ted	 con 	 ference 	 	 attend 	 ee 	 	--	chee	pearlman	,	who	 hope 	 fully 	 	is	in	the	audience	 some 	 where 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
she	was	the	editor	then	of	a	magazine	 call 	 ed 	 	id	,	and	she	 g 	 ave 	 	me	a	cover	story	.
 th 	 is 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	an	 in 	 credible 	 	journey	.
 cur 	 ious 	 	 en 	 counter 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	to	me	at	the	time	;	i	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 accept 	 ing 	 	 nume 	 r 	 ous 	 	 invit 	 ations 	 	to	speak	on	the	design	of	the	cheetah	 leg 	 s 	 	around	the	world	.
and	people	would	come	up	to	me	after	the	 con 	 ference 	 	,	after	my	talk	,	men	and	women	.
and	the	conversation	would	go	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	``	you	know	aimee	,	you	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 attract 	 ive 	 	.
you	do	n't	look	 dis 	 able 	 d 	 	.	``	i	thought	,	``	well	,	that	's	 amaz 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	do	n't	feel	 dis 	 able 	 d 	 	.	``	and	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 open 	 ed 	 	my	 eye 	 s 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	conversation	that	could	be	 explore 	 d 	 	,	about	 beaut 	 y 	 	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	woman	have	to	look	like	?
what	is	a	sexy	body	?
and	 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	from	an	 ident 	 ity 	 	 stand 	 point 	 	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	it	mean	to	have	a	 dis 	 ability 	 	?
i	mean	,	people	--	pamela	anderson	 ha 	 s 	 	more	 prost 	 hetic 	 	in	her	body	than	i	do	.
 no 	 body 	 	 call 	 s 	 	her	 dis 	 able 	 d 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	magazine	,	through	the	 hand 	 s 	 	of	graphic	 design 	 er 	 	peter	saville	,	went	to	fashion	 design 	 er 	 	alexander	mcqueen	,	and	 photograph 	 er 	 	nick	 k 	 night 	 	,	who	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	that	conversation	.
so	,	three	 month 	 s 	 	after	ted	i	found	 my 	 self 	 	on	a	plane	to	london	,	 do 	 ing 	 	my	first	fashion	shoot	,	which	 result 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	cover	--	``	fashion	-	able	``	?	three	 month 	 s 	 	after	that	,	i	did	my	first	 run 	 way 	 	show	for	alexander	mcqueen	on	a	pair	of	hand	-	 carv 	 ed 	 	 wood 	 en 	 	 leg 	 s 	 	made	from	solid	ash	.
 no 	 body 	 	 k 	 new 	 	--	 every 	 one 	 	thought	they	 we 	 re 	 	 wood 	 en 	 	 boot 	 s 	 	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	have	them	on	stage	with	me	:	 grape 	 vine 	 s 	 	,	 magn 	 ol 	 ia 	 s 	 	--	 tru 	 ly 	 	 stunn 	 ing 	 	.
 poet 	 ry 	 	 matter 	 s 	 	.
 poet 	 ry 	 	is	what	 elev 	 ates 	 	the	 ban 	 al 	 	and	 neglect 	 ed 	 	object	to	a	realm	of	art	.
it	can	transform	the	thing	that	might	have	made	people	 fear 	 ful 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 invit 	 es 	 	them	to	look	,	and	look	a	little	 long 	 er 	 	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	even	understand	.
i	 learn 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 first 	 hand 	 	with	my	next	adventure	.
the	artist	matthew	barney	,	in	his	film	opus	 call 	 ed 	 	the	``	the	cremaster	cycle	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	where	it	 re 	 ally 	 	hit	home	for	me	--	that	my	 leg 	 s 	 	could	be	 wear 	 able 	 	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	.
and	even	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	move	away	from	the	need	to	replicate	human	-	ness	 a 	 s 	 	the	 on 	 ly 	 	aesthetic	ideal	.
so	we	made	what	people	 loving 	 ly 	 	 refer 	 red 	 	to	 a 	 s 	 	glass	 leg 	 s 	 	even	 th 	 ough 	 	they	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 optical 	 ly 	 	clear	 poly 	 ur 	 ethane 	 	,	a.k.a	.	 bowl 	 ing 	 	ball	material	.
heavy	!
then	we	made	these	 leg 	 s 	 	that	are	cast	in	 s 	 oil 	 	with	a	potato	root	system	growing	in	them	,	and	 be 	 et 	 root 	 s 	 	out	the	top	,	and	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 love 	 ly 	 	 bra 	 s 	 s 	 	 to 	 e 	 	.
that	's	a	good	close	-	up	of	that	one	.
then	 an 	 other 	 	character	was	a	half	-	woman	,	half	-	cheetah	--	a	little	 hom 	 age 	 	to	my	life	 a 	 s 	 	an	athlete	.
14	 hour 	 s 	 	of	 prost 	 hetic 	 	make	-	up	to	get	 in 	 to 	 	a	creature	that	had	 articulate 	 d 	 	 paw 	 s 	 	,	 claw 	 s 	 	and	a	tail	that	 whip 	 ped 	 	around	,	like	a	gecko	.
and	then	 an 	 other 	 	pair	of	 leg 	 s 	 	we	 collabor 	 ated 	 	on	 we 	 re 	 	these	--	look	like	 jelly 	 fish 	 	 leg 	 s 	 	,
 al 	 so 	 	 poly 	 ur 	 ethane 	 	.
and	the	 on 	 ly 	 	purpose	that	these	 leg 	 s 	 	can	serve	,	 out 	 side 	 	the	 con 	 text 	 	of	the	film	,	is	to	 provok 	 e 	 	the	 sense 	 s 	 	and	ignite	the	 imagin 	 ation 	 	.
so	 whim 	 s 	 y 	 	 matter 	 s 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	i	have	over	a	dozen	pair	of	 prost 	 hetic 	 	 leg 	 s 	 	that	 vari 	 ous 	 	people	have	made	for	me	,	and	with	them	i	have	different	 negoti 	 ations 	 	of	the	 terra 	 in 	 	under	my	feet	,
and	i	can	change	my	height	--	i	have	a	 vari 	 able 	 	of	five	different	 height 	 s 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	i	'm	6'1	``	.
and	i	had	these	 leg 	 s 	 	made	a	little	over	a	year	ago	at	dorset	 ortho 	 pedic 	 	in	england	and	when	i	 br 	 ought 	 	them	home	to	manhattan	,	my	first	night	out	on	the	town	,	i	went	to	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 f 	 ancy 	 	party	.
and	a	girl	was	there	who	 ha 	 s 	 	known	me	for	 year 	 s 	 	at	my	normal	5'8	``	.
her	mouth	 drop 	 ped 	 	open	when	she	saw	me	,	and	she	went	,	``	but	you	're	so	tall	!	``	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	know	.	is	n't	it	 f 	 un 	 	?	``	i	mean	,	it	's	a	little	bit	like	 wear 	 ing 	 	 s 	 tilt 	 s 	 	on	 s 	 tilt 	 s 	 	,	but	i	have	an	 entire 	 ly 	 	new	relationship	to	door	 jam 	 s 	 	that	i	never	 expect 	 ed 	 	i	would	ever	have	.
and	i	was	 hav 	 ing 	 	 f 	 un 	 	with	it	.
and	she	 look 	 ed 	 	at	me	,	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	but	,	aimee	,	that	's	not	fair	.	``	and	the	 in 	 credible 	 	thing	was	she	 re 	 ally 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	it	.
it	's	not	fair	that	you	can	change	your	height	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	want	it	.
and	that	's	when	i	 k 	 new 	 	--	that	's	when	i	 k 	 new 	 	that	the	conversation	with	 socie 	 ty 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	 pro 	 found 	 ly 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	last	decade	.
it	is	no	 long 	 er 	 	a	conversation	about	 over 	 coming 	 	 defici 	 ency 	 	.	it	's	a	conversation	about	 augment 	 ation 	 	.
it	's	a	conversation	about	potential	.
a	 prost 	 hetic 	 	limb	 do 	 es 	 	n't	represent	the	need	to	replace	loss	 any 	 more 	 	.
it	can	stand	 a 	 s 	 	a	symbol	that	the	 wear 	 er 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	the	power	to	create	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	that	they	want	to	create	in	that	space	.
so	people	that	 socie 	 ty 	 	once	 consider 	 ed 	 	to	be	 dis 	 able 	 d 	 	can	now	 be 	 come 	 	the	 architect 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 ident 	 ities 	 	and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	 continu 	 e 	 	to	change	 t 	 hose 	 	 ident 	 ities 	 	by	 design 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	bodies	from	a	place	of	 empower 	 ment 	 	.
and	what	is	 excit 	 ing 	 	to	me	so	much	right	now	is	that	by	 comb 	 in 	 ing 	 	cutting	-	edge	technology	--	 robotic 	 s 	 	,	 bio 	 nic 	 s 	 	--	with	the	age	-	old	 poet 	 ry 	 	,	we	are	moving	 close 	 r 	 	to	 understand 	 ing 	 	our	 collect 	 ive 	 	 human 	 ity 	 	.
i	think	that	if	we	want	to	discover	the	full	potential	in	our	 human 	 ity 	 	,	we	need	to	 celebr 	 ate 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 heart 	 break 	 ing 	 	 strength 	 s 	 	and	 t 	 hose 	 	 glor 	 ious 	 	 dis 	 abilities 	 	that	we	all	have	.
i	think	of	shakespeare	's	shylock	:	``	if	you	prick	us	,	do	we	not	 ble 	 ed 	 	,	and	if	you	tickle	us	,	do	we	not	laugh	?	``	it	is	our	 human 	 ity 	 	,	and	all	the	potential	 with 	 in 	 	it	,	that	 make 	 s 	 	us	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
thank	you	.
