imagine	a	big	explosion	 a 	 s 	 	you	climb	through	3,000	ft	.
imagine	a	plane	full	of	smoke	.
imagine	an	engine	going	clack	,	clack	,	clack	,	clack	,	clack	,	clack	,	clack	.
it	 sound 	 s 	 	 scar 	 y 	 	.
well	i	had	a	 un 	 ique 	 	seat	that	day	.	i	was	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	_UNK_	.
i	was	the	 on 	 ly 	 	one	who	could	talk	to	the	flight	_UNK_	.
so	i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	them	right	away	,	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	problem	.	we	 prob 	 ably 	 	hit	some	 bird 	 s 	 	.	``
the	pilot	had	 al 	 ready 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	the	plane	around	,	and	we	 we 	 re 	 	n't	that	far	.
you	could	see	manhattan	.
two	 minute 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	three	 thing 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	at	the	same	time	.
the	pilot	lines	up	the	plane	with	the	hudson	river	.
that	's	 usual 	 ly 	 	not	the	route	.
he	 turn 	 s 	 	off	the	 engine 	 s 	 	.
now	imagine	 be 	 ing 	 	in	a	plane	with	no	sound	.
and	then	he	 say 	 s 	 	three	 word 	 s 	 	--	the	most	 un 	 emotion 	 al 	 	three	 word 	 s 	 	i	've	ever	heard	.
he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	brace	for	impact	.	``
i	did	n't	have	to	talk	to	the	flight	 attend 	 ant 	 	 any 	 more 	 	.
i	could	see	in	her	 eye 	 s 	 	,	it	was	terror	.	life	was	over	.
now	i	want	to	share	with	you	three	 thing 	 s 	 	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	about	 my 	 self 	 	that	day	.
i	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	it	all	 change 	 s 	 	in	an	instant	.
we	have	 th 	 is 	 	 buck 	 et 	 	list	,	we	have	these	 thing 	 s 	 	we	want	to	do	in	life	,	and	i	thought	about	all	the	people	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	reach	out	to	that	i	did	n't	,	all	the	 f 	 ence 	 s 	 	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 men 	 d 	 	,	all	the	 experience 	 s 	 	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	have	and	i	never	did	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	thought	about	that	 lat 	 er 	 	on	,	i	came	up	with	a	 say 	 ing 	 	,	which	is	,	``	i	collect	bad	 wine 	 s 	 	.	``
 be 	 cause 	 	if	the	wine	is	ready	and	the	person	is	there	,	i	'm	 open 	 ing 	 	it	.
i	no	 long 	 er 	 	want	to	postpone	 any 	 thing 	 	in	life	.
and	that	 urge 	 ncy 	 	,	that	purpose	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 change 	 d 	 	my	life	.
the	second	thing	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	day	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 a 	 s 	 	we	clear	the	george	washington	bridge	,	which	was	by	not	a	lot	--	i	thought	about	,	 w 	 ow 	 	,	i	 re 	 ally 	 	feel	one	real	regret	.
i	've	lived	a	good	life	.
in	my	own	 human 	 ity 	 	and	 mistak 	 es 	 	,	i	've	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	get	better	at	 every 	 thing 	 	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	.
but	in	my	 human 	 ity 	 	,	i	 al 	 so 	 	allow	my	ego	to	get	in	.
and	i	 regret 	 ted 	 	the	time	i	 waste 	 d 	 	on	 thing 	 s 	 	that	did	not	matter	with	people	that	matter	.
and	i	thought	about	my	relationship	with	my	wife	,	with	my	 friend 	 s 	 	,	with	people	.
and	after	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 reflect 	 ed 	 	on	that	,	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	eliminate	negative	energy	from	my	life	.
it	's	not	perfect	,	but	it	's	a	lot	better	.
i	've	not	had	a	fight	with	my	wife	in	two	 year 	 s 	 	.
it	 feel 	 s 	 	great	.
i	no	 long 	 er 	 	try	to	be	right	;
i	 choos 	 e 	 	to	be	happy	.
the	third	thing	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 a 	 s 	 	your	mental	clock	 start 	 s 	 	going	,	``	15	,	14	,	13.	``
you	can	see	the	water	coming	.
i	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	 pleas 	 e 	 	blow	up	.	``
i	do	n't	want	 th 	 is 	 	thing	to	break	in	20	 piece 	 s 	 	like	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 document 	 aries 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	we	're	coming	down	,	i	had	a	sense	of	,	 w 	 ow 	 	,	 dy 	 ing 	 	is	not	 scar 	 y 	 	.
it	's	 al 	 most 	 	like	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 pre 	 par 	 ing 	 	for	it	our	whole	 live 	 s 	 	.
but	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 ad 	 	.
i	did	n't	want	to	go	;	i	love	my	life	.
and	that	 s 	 ad 	 ness 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 frame 	 d 	 	in	one	thought	,	which	is	,	i	 on 	 ly 	 	wish	for	one	thing	.
i	 on 	 ly 	 	wish	i	could	see	my	 kid 	 s 	 	grow	up	.
about	a	month	 lat 	 er 	 	,	i	was	at	a	performance	by	my	daughter	--	first	-	 grad 	 er 	 	,	not	much	 art 	 istic 	 	talent	...
...	yet	.
and	i	'm	_UNK_	,	i	'm	 cry 	 ing 	 	,	like	a	little	kid	.
and	it	made	all	the	sense	in	the	world	to	me	.
i	 real 	 ized 	 	at	that	point	,	by	 connect 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 dot 	 s 	 	,	that	the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	that	 matter 	 s 	 	in	my	life	is	 be 	 ing 	 	a	great	dad	.
above	all	,	above	all	,	the	 on 	 ly 	 	goal	i	have	in	life	is	to	be	a	good	dad	.
i	was	 give 	 n 	 	the	gift	of	a	miracle	,	of	not	 dy 	 ing 	 	that	day	.
i	was	 give 	 n 	 	 an 	 other 	 	gift	,	which	was	to	be	able	to	see	 in 	 to 	 	the	future	and	come	back	and	live	 different 	 ly 	 	.
i	 challeng 	 e 	 	you	 guy 	 s 	 	that	are	 fly 	 ing 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	imagine	the	same	thing	 happen 	 s 	 	on	your	plane	--	and	 pleas 	 e 	 	do	n't	--	but	imagine	,	and	how	would	you	change	?
what	would	you	get	 d 	 one 	 	that	you	're	 wait 	 ing 	 	to	get	 d 	 one 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	you	think	you	'll	be	here	 fore 	 ver 	 	?
how	would	you	change	your	 relationship 	 s 	 	and	the	negative	energy	in	them	?
and	more	than	 any 	 thing 	 	,	are	you	 be 	 ing 	 	the	best	parent	you	can	?
thank	you	.
