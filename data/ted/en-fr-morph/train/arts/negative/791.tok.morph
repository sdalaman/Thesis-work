ok	.	we	've	heard	a	lot	of	people	speak	at	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	about	the	power	of	the	human	mind	.
and	what	i	'd	like	to	do	 to 	 day 	 	is	give	you	a	 vivi 	 d 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	how	that	power	can	be	 unleash 	 ed 	 	when	 some 	 one 	 	is	in	a	 surviv 	 al 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	how	the	will	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	can	 br 	 ing 	 	that	out	in	people	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	incident	which	 occur 	 red 	 	on	mount	everest	;
it	was	the	worst	disaster	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	everest	.
and	when	it	 occur 	 red 	 	,	i	was	the	 on 	 ly 	 	doctor	on	the	mountain	.
so	i	'll	take	you	through	that	and	we	'll	see	what	it	's	like	when	 some 	 one 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 summon 	 s 	 	the	will	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	.
ok	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	mount	everest	.
it	's	29,035	feet	high	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	there	six	 time 	 s 	 	:	four	 time 	 s 	 	i	did	work	with	national	 geo 	 graphic 	 	,	making	tectonic	plate	 measure 	 ments 	 	;
twice	,	i	went	with	nasa	 do 	 ing 	 	remote	 sens 	 ing 	 	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	.
it	was	on	my	fourth	trip	to	everest	that	a	 com 	 et 	 	 pass 	 ed 	 	over	the	mountain	.	hyakutake	.
and	the	sherpas	told	us	then	that	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	bad	 o 	 men 	 	,	and	we	should	have	 listen 	 ed 	 	to	them	.
everest	is	an	 extrem 	 e 	 	environment	.
there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	one	-	third	 a 	 s 	 	much	oxygen	at	the	 summ 	 it 	 	 a 	 s 	 	there	is	at	sea	level	.
near	the	 summ 	 it 	 	,	 temperature 	 s 	 	can	be	40	 degree 	 s 	 	 be 	 low 	 	zero	.
you	can	have	 wind 	 s 	 	20	to	40	 mile 	 s 	 	an	hour	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	wind	-	chill	factor	which	is	lower	than	a	summer	day	on	mars	.
i	remember	one	time	 be 	 ing 	 	up	near	the	 summ 	 it 	 	,
i	 reach 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	my	down	jacket	for	a	drink	from	my	water	bottle	,	 in 	 side 	 	my	down	jacket	,	 on 	 ly 	 	to	discover	that	the	water	was	 al 	 ready 	 	 froze 	 n 	 	solid	.
that	 give 	 s 	 	you	an	idea	of	just	how	severe	 thing 	 s 	 	are	near	the	 summ 	 it 	 	.
ok	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	route	up	everest	.
it	 start 	 s 	 	at	base	camp	,	at	17,500	feet	.
camp	one	,	2,000	feet	 high 	 er 	 	.
camp	two	,	 an 	 other 	 	2,000	feet	 high 	 er 	 	up	,	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	western	cwm	.
campthree	is	at	the	base	of	lhotse	,	which	is	the	fourth	highest	mountain	in	the	world	,	but	it	's	 dwarf 	 ed 	 	by	everest	.
and	then	camp	four	is	the	highest	camp	;
that	's	3,000	feet	short	of	the	 summ 	 it 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	view	of	base	camp	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 pitch 	 ed 	 	on	a	 glaci 	 er 	 	at	17,500	feet	.
it	's	the	highest	point	you	can	 br 	 ing 	 	your	 yak 	 s 	 	before	you	have	to	 un 	 load 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	they	 un 	 load 	 ed 	 	for	me	:
i	had	four	yak	 load 	 s 	 	of	medical	 suppli 	 es 	 	,	which	are	 dump 	 ed 	 	in	a	tent	,
and	here	i	am	 try 	 ing 	 	to	arrange	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	our	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 	.
it	was	a	national	 geo 	 graphic 	 	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 	,	but	it	was	 organize 	 d 	 	by	the	 explore 	 rs 	 	club	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	three	other	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 s 	 	on	the	mountain	,	an	american	team	,	a	new	zealand	team	and	an	imax	team	.
and	,	after	 actual 	 ly 	 	two	 month 	 s 	 	of	 pre 	 par 	 ation 	 	,	we	built	our	 camp 	 s 	 	all	the	way	up	the	mountain	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	view	looking	up	the	 ice 	 fall 	 	,
the	first	2,000	feet	of	the	climb	up	from	base	camp	.
and	here	's	a	picture	in	the	 ice 	 fall 	 	;
it	's	a	 water 	 fall 	 	,	but	it	's	 froze 	 n 	 	,	but	it	 move 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	,	and	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 change 	 s 	 	every	day	.
when	you	're	in	it	,	you	're	like	a	rat	in	a	maze	;	you	ca	n't	even	see	over	the	top	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	near	the	top	of	the	 ice 	 fall 	 	.
you	want	to	climb	through	at	night	when	the	ice	is	 froze 	 n 	 	.
that	way	,	it	's	less	 like 	 ly 	 	to	tumble	down	on	you	.
these	are	some	 climb 	 ers 	 	 reach 	 ing 	 	the	top	of	the	 ice 	 fall 	 	just	at	 s 	 un 	 	-	up	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	me	 cross 	 ing 	 	a	crevasse	.
we	cross	on	 a 	 lumin 	 um 	 	 lad 	 d 	 ers 	 	with	 safe 	 ty 	 	 rope 	 s 	 	 attach 	 ed 	 	.
that	's	 an 	 other 	 	crevasse	.
some	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	10	 st 	 ories 	 	deep	or	more	,	and	one	of	my	 climb 	 ing 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	 say 	 s 	 	that	the	reason	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	climb	at	night	is	 be 	 cause 	 	if	we	ever	saw	the	bottom	of	what	we	're	 climb 	 ing 	 	over	,	we	would	never	do	it	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	camp	one	.
it	's	the	first	flat	spot	you	can	reach	after	you	get	up	to	the	top	of	the	 ice 	 fall 	 	.
and	from	there	we	climb	up	to	camp	two	,
which	is	sort	of	the	 fore 	 ground 	 	.
these	are	 climb 	 ers 	 	moving	up	the	lhotse	face	,	that	mountain	 to 	 ward 	 	camp	three	.
they	're	on	 fix 	 ed 	 	 rope 	 s 	 	here	.
a	fall	here	,	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 rope 	 d 	 	in	,	would	be	5,000	feet	down	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	view	taken	from	camp	three	.
you	can	see	the	lhotse	face	is	in	profile	,
it	's	about	a	45	degree	angle	.	it	 take 	 s 	 	two	 day 	 s 	 	to	climb	it	,
so	you	put	the	camp	 half 	 way 	 	through	.
if	you	notice	,	the	 summ 	 it 	 	of	everest	is	black	.
there	's	no	ice	over	it	.
and	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	everest	is	so	high	,	it	's	in	the	jet	stream	,	and	 wind 	 s 	 	are	 constant 	 ly 	 	 scour 	 ing 	 	the	face	,	so	no	snow	 get 	 s 	 	to	 accumul 	 ate 	 	.
what	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	cloud	 be 	 hind 	 	the	 summ 	 it 	 	ridge	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	snow	 be 	 ing 	 	blown	off	the	 summ 	 it 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	on	the	way	up	from	camp	three	to	camp	four	,	moving	in	,	up	through	the	 cloud 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	at	camp	four	.
once	you	get	to	camp	four	,	you	have	 may 	 be 	 	24	 hour 	 s 	 	to	decide	if	you	're	going	to	go	for	the	 summ 	 it 	 	or	not	.
 every 	 body 	 	's	on	oxygen	,	your	 suppli 	 es 	 	are	 limit 	 ed 	 	,	and	you	either	have	to	go	up	or	go	down	,	make	that	decision	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	of	rob	hall	.
he	was	the	 lead 	 er 	 	of	the	new	zealand	team	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	radio	he	used	 lat 	 er 	 	to	call	his	wife	that	i	'll	tell	you	about	.
these	are	some	 climb 	 ers 	 	 wait 	 ing 	 	to	go	to	the	 summ 	 it 	 	.
they	're	up	at	camp	four	,	and	you	can	see	that	there	's	wind	 blow 	 ing 	 	off	the	 summ 	 it 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	good	weather	to	climb	in	,	so	the	 climb 	 ers 	 	are	just	 wait 	 ing 	 	,	 hop 	 ing 	 	that	the	wind	's	going	to	die	down	.
and	,	in	fact	,	the	wind	 do 	 es 	 	die	down	at	night	.
it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	calm	,	there	's	no	wind	at	all	.
 th 	 is 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	good	chance	to	go	for	the	 summ 	 it 	 	.
so	here	are	some	 climb 	 ers 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	out	for	the	 summ 	 it 	 	on	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 tri 	 angular 	 	face	.
it	's	the	first	part	of	climb	.
it	's	 d 	 one 	 	in	the	dark	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	less	steep	than	what	 come 	 s 	 	next	,	and	you	can	gain	 day 	 light 	 	 hour 	 s 	 	if	you	do	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	dark	.
so	that	's	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
the	 climb 	 ers 	 	got	on	the	 south 	 east 	 	ridge	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	view	looking	at	the	 south 	 east 	 	ridge	.
the	 summ 	 it 	 	would	be	in	the	 fore 	 ground 	 	.
from	here	,	it	's	about	1,500	feet	up	at	a	30	-	degree	angle	to	the	 summ 	 it 	 	.
but	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	that	year	was	the	wind	 sudden 	 ly 	 	and	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 ly 	 	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	.
a	storm	 ble 	 w 	 	in	that	no	one	was	 anticip 	 ating 	 	.
you	can	see	here	some	ferocious	 wind 	 s 	 	 blow 	 ing 	 	snow	way	high	off	the	 summ 	 it 	 	.
and	there	 we 	 re 	 	 climb 	 ers 	 	on	that	 summ 	 it 	 	ridge	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	of	me	in	that	area	taken	a	year	before	,	and	you	can	see	i	've	got	an	oxygen	mask	on	with	a	 re 	 breath 	 er 	 	.
i	have	an	oxygen	hose	 connect 	 ed 	 	here	.
you	can	see	on	 th 	 is 	 	 climb 	 er 	 	,	we	have	two	oxygen	 tank 	 s 	 	in	the	 back 	 pack 	 	--	little	 titan 	 ium 	 	 tank 	 s 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 light 	 weight 	 	--
and	we	're	not	 carry 	 ing 	 	much	else	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	all	you	've	got	.	you	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	on	the	 summ 	 it 	 	ridge	.
ok	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	view	taken	on	the	 summ 	 it 	 	ridge	 it 	 self 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	on	the	way	 to 	 ward 	 	the	 summ 	 it 	 	,	on	that	1,500	-	foot	bridge	.
all	the	 climb 	 ers 	 	here	are	 climb 	 ing 	 	 un 	 rope 	 d 	 	,	and	the	reason	is	 be 	 cause 	 	the	drop	off	is	so	 she 	 er 	 	on	either	side	that	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	 rope 	 d 	 	to	 some 	 body 	 	,	you	'd	wind	up	just	 pull 	 ing 	 	them	off	with	you	.
so	each	person	 climb 	 s 	 	 individual 	 ly 	 	.
and	it	's	not	a	straight	path	at	all	,
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	 climb 	 ing 	 	,	and	there	's	 al 	 ways 	 	the	risk	of	 fall 	 ing 	 	on	either	side	.
if	you	fall	to	your	left	,	you	're	going	to	fall	8,000	feet	 in 	 to 	 	nepal	;
if	you	fall	to	your	right	,	you	're	going	to	fall	12,000	feet	 in 	 to 	 	tibet	.
so	it	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	better	to	fall	 in 	 to 	 	tibet
 be 	 cause 	 	you	'll	live	 long 	 er 	 	.
but	,	either	way	,	you	fall	for	the	rest	of	your	life	.
ok	.	 t 	 hose 	 	 climb 	 ers 	 	 we 	 re 	 	up	near	the	 summ 	 it 	 	,	 a 	 long 	 	that	 summ 	 it 	 	ridge	that	you	see	up	there	,	and	i	was	down	here	in	camp	three	.
my	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 	was	down	in	camp	three	,	while	these	 guy 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	up	there	in	the	storm	.
the	storm	was	so	fierce	that	we	had	to	lay	,
fully	 dress 	 ed 	 	,	fully	 equi 	 pped 	 	,	laid	out	on	the	tent	floor	to	stop	the	tent	from	 blow 	 ing 	 	off	the	mountain	.
it	was	the	worst	 wind 	 s 	 	i	've	ever	 s 	 een 	 	.
and	the	 climb 	 ers 	 	up	on	the	ridge	 we 	 re 	 	that	much	 high 	 er 	 	,	2,000	feet	 high 	 er 	 	,	and	 complete 	 ly 	 	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	to	the	 element 	 s 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	in	radio	contact	with	some	of	them	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	view	taken	 a 	 long 	 	the	 summ 	 it 	 	ridge	.
rob	hall	,	we	heard	by	radio	,	was	up	here	,	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	in	the	storm	with	doug	hansen	.
and	we	heard	that	rob	was	ok	,	but	doug	was	too	weak	to	come	down	.
he	was	 exhaust 	 ed 	 	,	and	rob	was	 stay 	 ing 	 	with	him	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	got	some	bad	news	in	the	storm	that	beck	 weather 	 s 	 	,	 an 	 other 	 	 climb 	 er 	 	,	had	 collapse 	 d 	 	in	the	snow	and	was	dead	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	still	18	other	 climb 	 ers 	 	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	n't	aware	of	 the 	 ir 	 	condition	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	lost	.	there	was	total	 con 	 fusion 	 	on	the	mountain	;
all	the	 st 	 ories 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 con 	 fusing 	 	,	most	of	them	 we 	 re 	 	 conflict 	 ing 	 	.
we	 re 	 ally 	 	had	no	idea	what	was	going	on	 dur 	 ing 	 	that	storm	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	just	 hunk 	 er 	 ed 	 	down	in	our	 tent 	 s 	 	at	camp	three	.
our	two	 strong 	 est 	 	 climb 	 ers 	 	,	todd	burleson	and	pete	athans	,	 decide 	 d 	 	to	go	up	to	try	to	 rescu 	 e 	 	who	they	could	even	 th 	 ough 	 	there	was	a	ferocious	storm	going	.
they	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	radio	a	 mess 	 age 	 	to	rob	hall	,	who	was	a	 super 	 b 	 	 climb 	 er 	 	 s 	 tuck 	 	,	sort	of	,	with	a	weak	 climb 	 er 	 	up	near	the	 summ 	 it 	 	.
i	 expect 	 ed 	 	them	to	say	to	rob	,	``	hold	on	.	we	're	coming	.	``
but	in	fact	,	what	they	 s 	 aid 	 	was	,	``	 leav 	 e 	 	doug	and	come	down	 your 	 self 	 	.
there	's	no	chance	of	saving	him	,	and	just	try	to	 s 	 ave 	 	 your 	 self 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	.	``
and	rob	got	that	 mess 	 age 	 	,	but	his	answer	was	,	``	we	're	both	 listen 	 ing 	 	.	``
todd	and	pete	got	up	to	the	 summ 	 it 	 	ridge	,	up	in	here	,	and	it	was	a	scene	of	complete	 cha 	 os 	 	up	there	.
but	they	did	what	they	could	to	 stabil 	 ize 	 	the	people	.
i	 g 	 ave 	 	them	radio	 ad 	 vice 	 	from	camp	three	,	and	we	 s 	 ent 	 	down	the	 climb 	 ers 	 	that	could	make	it	down	under	 the 	 ir 	 	own	power	.
the	 one 	 s 	 	that	could	n't	we	just	sort	of	 decide 	 d 	 	to	 leav 	 e 	 	up	at	camp	four	.
so	the	 climb 	 ers 	 	 we 	 re 	 	coming	down	 a 	 long 	 	 th 	 is 	 	route	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	taken	from	camp	three	,	where	i	was	.
and	they	all	came	by	me	so	i	could	take	a	look	at	them	and	see	what	i	could	do	for	them	,	which	is	 re 	 ally 	 	not	much	,	 be 	 cause 	 	camp	three	is	a	little	 not 	 ch 	 	cut	in	the	ice	in	the	middle	of	a	45	-	degree	angle	.
you	can	 bare 	 ly 	 	stand	 out 	 side 	 	the	tent	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	cold	;	it	's	24,000	feet	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	 suppli 	 es 	 	i	had	at	that	altitude	 we 	 re 	 	two	plastic	 bag 	 s 	 	with	 pre 	 load 	 ed 	 	 syringe 	 s 	 	of	 pain 	 killer 	 	and	 steroid 	 s 	 	.
so	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	 climb 	 ers 	 	came	by	me	,	i	sort	of	 assess 	 ed 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	they	 we 	 re 	 	in	condition	to	 continu 	 e 	 	on	further	down	.
the	 one 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	n't	that	lucid	or	 we 	 re 	 	not	that	well	 coordinate 	 d 	 	,	i	would	give	an	 inject 	 ion 	 	of	 steroid 	 s 	 	to	try	to	give	them	some	period	of	 lucid 	 ity 	 	and	 coordi 	 nation 	 	where	they	could	then	work	 the 	 ir 	 	way	further	down	the	mountain	.
it	's	so	awkward	to	work	up	there	that	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	i	even	 g 	 ave 	 	the	 inject 	 ions 	 	right	through	 the 	 ir 	 	 clothe 	 s 	 	.
it	was	just	too	hard	to	maneuver	any	other	way	up	there	.
while	i	was	taking	care	of	them	,	we	got	more	news	about	rob	hall	.
there	was	no	way	we	could	get	up	high	 en 	 ough 	 	to	 rescu 	 e 	 	him	.
he	 call 	 ed 	 	in	to	say	that	he	was	 al 	 one 	 	now	.
 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	,	doug	had	 di 	 ed 	 	 high 	 er 	 	up	on	the	mountain	.
but	rob	was	now	too	weak	to	come	down	 him 	 self 	 	,	and	with	the	fierce	 wind 	 s 	 	and	up	at	that	altitude	,	he	was	just	beyond	 rescu 	 e 	 	and	he	 k 	 new 	 	it	.
at	that	point	,	he	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	be	 page 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	his	wife	.
he	was	 carry 	 ing 	 	a	radio	.
his	wife	was	home	in	new	zealand	,	seven	 month 	 s 	 	 pregn 	 ant 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	first	child	,
and	rob	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	be	 patch 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	her	.	that	was	 d 	 one 	 	,
and	rob	and	his	wife	had	 the 	 ir 	 	last	conversation	.
they	 pick 	 ed 	 	the	name	for	 the 	 ir 	 	baby	.
rob	then	 sign 	 ed 	 	off	,	and	that	was	the	last	we	ever	heard	of	him	.
i	was	 face 	 d 	 	with	 treat 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	 critical 	 ly 	 	ill	 patient 	 s 	 	at	24,000	feet	,	which	was	an	 im 	 possibil 	 ity 	 	.
so	what	we	did	was	,	we	got	the	 victim 	 s 	 	down	to	21,000	feet	,	where	it	was	 eas 	 ier 	 	for	me	to	treat	them	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	my	medical	kit	.
it	's	a	tackle	box	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	medical	 suppli 	 es 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	carried	up	the	mountain	.
i	had	more	 suppli 	 es 	 	lower	down	,	which	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	be	 br 	 ought 	 	up	to	meet	me	at	the	lower	camp	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	scene	at	the	lower	camp	.
the	 surviv 	 ors 	 	came	in	one	by	one	.
some	of	them	 we 	 re 	 	 hypo 	 thermic 	 	,	some	of	them	 we 	 re 	 	 frost 	 bitten 	 	,	some	 we 	 re 	 	both	.
what	we	did	was	try	to	warm	them	up	 a 	 s 	 	best	we	could	,	put	oxygen	on	them	and	try	to	 rev 	 ive 	 	them	,	which	is	difficult	to	do	at	21,000	feet	,	when	the	tent	is	freezing	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	some	severe	 frost 	 bite 	 	on	the	feet	,	severe	 frost 	 bite 	 	on	the	nose	.
 th 	 is 	 	 climb 	 er 	 	was	snow	blind	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	was	taking	care	of	these	 climb 	 ers 	 	,	we	got	a	 start 	 ling 	 	experience	.
out	of	 no 	 where 	 	,	beck	 weather 	 s 	 	,	who	we	had	 al 	 ready 	 	 be 	 en 	 	told	was	dead	,	 s 	 tumble 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	tent	,	just	like	a	 mum 	 my 	 	,	he	 walk 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	tent	.
i	 expect 	 ed 	 	him	to	be	 in 	 cohere 	 nt 	 	,	but	,	in	fact	,	he	 walk 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	tent	and	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	``	hi	,	ken	.	where	should	i	 s 	 it 	 	?	``
and	then	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	do	you	accept	my	health	 insur 	 ance 	 	?	``
he	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	that	.
so	he	was	 complete 	 ly 	 	lucid	,	but	he	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 severe 	 ly 	 	 frost 	 bitten 	 	.
you	can	see	his	hand	is	 complete 	 ly 	 	white	;	his	face	,	his	nose	,	is	 burn 	 ed 	 	.
first	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	white	,	and	then	when	it	's	 complete 	 d 	 	 necro 	 sis 	 	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	black	,	and	then	it	 fall 	 s 	 	off	.
it	's	the	last	stage	,	just	like	a	scar	.
so	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	was	taking	care	of	beck	,	he	related	what	had	 be 	 en 	 	going	on	up	there	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	he	had	gotten	lost	in	the	storm	,	 collapse 	 d 	 	in	the	snow	,	and	just	laid	there	,	 un 	 able 	 	to	move	.
some	 climb 	 ers 	 	had	come	by	and	 look 	 ed 	 	at	him	,	and	he	heard	them	say	,	``	he	's	dead	.	``
but	beck	was	n't	dead	;	he	heard	that	,	but	he	was	 complete 	 ly 	 	 un 	 able 	 	to	move	.
he	was	in	some	sort	of	 cata 	 ton 	 ic 	 	state	where	he	could	be	aware	of	his	 surround 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	but	could	n't	even	blink	to	 indic 	 ate 	 	that	he	was	 al 	 ive 	 	.
so	the	 climb 	 ers 	 	 pass 	 ed 	 	him	by	,	and	beck	lay	there	for	a	day	,	a	night	and	 an 	 other 	 	day	,	in	the	snow	.
and	then	he	 s 	 aid 	 	to	 him 	 self 	 	,	``	i	do	n't	want	to	die	.
i	have	a	family	to	come	back	to	.	``
and	the	 thought 	 s 	 	of	his	family	,	his	 kid 	 s 	 	and	his	wife	,	generated	 en 	 ough 	 	energy	,	 en 	 ough 	 	 motiv 	 ation 	 	in	him	,	so	that	he	 actual 	 ly 	 	got	up	.
after	 lay 	 ing 	 	in	the	snow	that	long	a	time	,	he	got	up	and	found	his	way	back	to	the	camp	.
and	beck	told	me	that	story	 ver 	 y 	 	 quiet 	 ly 	 	,	but	i	was	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 stunn 	 ed 	 	by	it	.
i	could	n't	imagine	 any 	 body 	 	 lay 	 ing 	 	in	the	snow	that	long	a	time	and	then	 get 	 ting 	 	up	.
he	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	 revers 	 ed 	 	an	 ir 	 revers 	 ible 	 	 hypo 	 ther 	 mia 	 	.
and	i	can	 on 	 ly 	 	try	to	 specul 	 ate 	 	on	how	he	did	it	.
so	,	what	if	we	had	beck	 hook 	 ed 	 	up	to	a	spect	 s 	 can 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	measure	brain	function	?
just	 ver 	 y 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	,	the	three	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	brain	:	the	frontal	lobe	,	where	you	focus	your	attention	and	 concent 	 ration 	 	;	you	have	the	temporal	lobe	,	where	you	form	 image 	 s 	 	and	keep	 memor 	 ies 	 	;	and	the	 po 	 s 	 terior 	 	part	of	your	brain	,	which	 contain 	 s 	 	the	 ce 	 rebel 	 lum 	 	,	which	 control 	 s 	 	motion	;	and	the	brain	stem	,	where	you	have	your	 bas 	 ic 	 	maintenance	 function 	 s 	 	,	like	 heart 	 beat 	 	and	 re 	 spi 	 ration 	 	.
so	let	's	take	a	cut	through	the	brain	here	,	and	imagine	that	beck	was	 hook 	 ed 	 	up	to	a	spect	 s 	 can 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	 measure 	 s 	 	dynamic	blood	flow	and	 there 	 fore 	 	energy	flow	 with 	 in 	 	the	brain	.
so	you	have	the	 pre 	 frontal 	 	cortex	here	,	 light 	 ing 	 	up	in	red	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	 even 	 ly 	 	 distribut 	 ed 	 	 s 	 can 	 	.
you	have	the	middle	area	,	where	the	temporal	lobe	might	be	,	in	here	,	and	the	 po 	 s 	 terior 	 	 port 	 ion 	 	,	where	the	maintenance	 function 	 s 	 	are	in	the	back	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 rough 	 ly 	 	normal	 s 	 can 	 	,	 show 	 ing 	 	equal	 distribut 	 ion 	 	of	energy	.
now	,	you	go	to	 th 	 is 	 	one	and	you	see	how	much	more	the	frontal	 lobe 	 s 	 	are	 light 	 ing 	 	up	.
 th 	 is 	 	might	be	what	beck	would	be	 ex 	 peri 	 encing 	 	when	he	 real 	 ize 	 s 	 	he	's	in	danger	.
he	's	 focus 	 ing 	 	all	his	attention	on	 get 	 ting 	 	 him 	 self 	 	out	of	trouble	.
these	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	brain	are	 quiet 	 ing 	 	down	.	he	's	not	 think 	 ing 	 	about	his	family	or	 any 	 body 	 	else	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	and	he	's	 work 	 ing 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	hard	.
he	's	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	his	 muscle 	 s 	 	going	and	get	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
ok	,	but	he	's	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	ground	here	.
he	's	running	out	of	energy	.
it	's	too	cold	;	he	ca	n't	keep	his	 metabol 	 ic 	 	 fire 	 s 	 	going	,
and	,	you	see	,	there	's	no	more	red	here	;
his	brain	is	 quiet 	 ing 	 	down	.
he	's	 collapse 	 d 	 	in	the	snow	here	.	 every 	 thing 	 	is	quiet	,
there	's	 ver 	 y 	 	little	red	 any 	 where 	 	.
beck	is	 power 	 ing 	 	down	.
he	's	 dy 	 ing 	 	.
you	go	on	to	the	next	 s 	 can 	 	,	but	,	in	beck	's	case	,	you	can	see	that	the	middle	part	of	his	brain	is	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	light	up	 aga 	 in 	 	.
he	's	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	think	about	his	family	.
he	's	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	have	 image 	 s 	 	that	are	 motiv 	 ating 	 	him	to	get	up	.
he	's	 develop 	 ing 	 	energy	in	 th 	 is 	 	area	through	thought	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	he	's	going	to	turn	thought	back	 in 	 to 	 	action	.
 th 	 is 	 	part	of	the	brain	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 an 	 terior 	 	 c 	 ing 	 ulate 	 	 gy 	 rus 	 	.
it	's	an	area	in	which	a	lot	of	 neuro 	 scientist 	 s 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	the	seat	of	will	 exist 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	where	people	make	 decision 	 s 	 	,	where	they	develop	 will 	 power 	 	.
and	,	you	can	see	,	there	's	an	energy	flow	going	from	the	mid	 port 	 ion 	 	of	his	brain	,	where	he	's	got	 image 	 s 	 	of	his	family	,	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	area	,	which	is	 power 	 ing 	 	his	will	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 get 	 ting 	 	 strong 	 er 	 	and	 strong 	 er 	 	to	the	point	where	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	to	be	a	 motiv 	 ating 	 	factor	.
he	's	going	to	develop	 en 	 ough 	 	energy	in	that	area	--	after	a	day	,	a	night	and	a	day	--	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	 motiv 	 ate 	 	 him 	 self 	 	to	get	up	.
and	you	can	see	here	,	he	's	 start 	 ing 	 	to	get	more	energy	 in 	 to 	 	the	frontal	lobe	.
he	's	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	focus	,	he	can	 concent 	 rate 	 	now	.
he	's	 think 	 ing 	 	about	what	he	's	got	to	do	to	 s 	 ave 	 	 him 	 self 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	energy	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 transmit 	 ted 	 	up	 to 	 ward 	 	the	front	of	his	brain	,	and	it	's	 get 	 ting 	 	 quiet 	 er 	 	down	here	,	but	he	's	using	 th 	 is 	 	energy	to	think	about	what	he	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	to	get	 him 	 self 	 	going	.
and	then	,	that	energy	is	sort	of	 spread 	 ing 	 	 through 	 out 	 	his	thought	 area 	 s 	 	.
he	's	not	 think 	 ing 	 	about	his	family	now	,	and	he	's	 get 	 ting 	 	 him 	 self 	 	 motiv 	 ated 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 po 	 s 	 terior 	 	part	,	where	his	 muscle 	 s 	 	are	going	to	be	moving	,	and	he	's	going	to	be	 pac 	 ing 	 	 him 	 self 	 	.
his	heart	and	 lung 	 s 	 	are	going	to	pick	up	speed	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	can	 specul 	 ate 	 	might	have	 be 	 en 	 	going	on	had	we	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	do	a	spect	 s 	 can 	 	on	beck	 dur 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 surviv 	 al 	 	epic	.
so	here	i	am	taking	care	of	beck	at	21,000	feet	,	and	i	felt	what	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	was	 complete 	 ly 	 	trivial	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	what	he	had	 d 	 one 	 	for	 him 	 self 	 	.
it	just	 show 	 s 	 	you	what	the	power	of	the	mind	can	do	.
he	was	 critical 	 ly 	 	ill	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	other	 critical 	 ly 	 	ill	 patient 	 s 	 	;
 luck 	 ily 	 	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	get	a	helicopter	in	to	 rescu 	 e 	 	these	 guy 	 s 	 	.
a	helicopter	came	in	at	21,000	feet	and	carried	out	the	highest	helicopter	 rescu 	 e 	 	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
it	was	able	to	land	on	the	ice	,	take	away	beck	and	the	other	 surviv 	 ors 	 	,	one	by	one	,	and	get	them	off	to	kathmandu	in	a	clinic	before	we	even	got	back	to	base	camp	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	scene	at	base	camp	,	at	one	of	the	 camp 	 s 	 	where	some	of	the	 climb 	 ers 	 	 we 	 re 	 	lost	.
and	we	had	a	memorial	service	there	a	few	 day 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
these	are	serphas	 light 	 ing 	 	 juni 	 per 	 	 branch 	 es 	 	.
they	 believ 	 e 	 	 juni 	 per 	 	smoke	is	holy	.
and	the	 climb 	 ers 	 	stood	around	on	the	high	 rock 	 s 	 	and	spoke	of	the	 climb 	 ers 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	lost	up	near	the	 summ 	 it 	 	,	 turn 	 ing 	 	to	the	mountain	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	to	talk	to	them	 direct 	 ly 	 	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	five	 climb 	 ers 	 	lost	here	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	scott	fischer	,	rob	hall	,	andy	harris	,	doug	hansen	and	yasuko	namba	.
and	one	more	 climb 	 er 	 	should	have	 di 	 ed 	 	that	day	,	but	did	n't	,	and	that	's	beck	 weather 	 s 	 	.
he	was	able	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	he	was	able	to	generate	that	 in 	 credible 	 	 will 	 power 	 	,	he	was	able	to	use	all	the	power	of	his	mind	to	 s 	 ave 	 	 him 	 self 	 	.
these	are	tibetan	 pray 	 er 	 	 flag 	 s 	 	.
these	sherpas	 believ 	 e 	 	that	if	you	write	 pray 	 ers 	 	on	these	 flag 	 s 	 	,
the	 mess 	 age 	 	will	be	carried	up	to	the	 god 	 s 	 	,	and	that	year	,	beck	's	 mess 	 age 	 	was	 answer 	 ed 	 	.
thank	you	.
