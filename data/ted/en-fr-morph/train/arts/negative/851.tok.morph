i	 br 	 ing 	 	to	you	a	 mess 	 age 	 	from	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	--	in	the	 village 	 s 	 	,	in	the	 s 	 lum 	 s 	 	,	in	the	 h 	 inter 	 land 	 	of	the	country	--	who	have	 solve 	 d 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	through	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 gen 	 ius 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	any	 out 	 side 	 	help	.
when	our	home	 mini 	 ster 	 	 announce 	 s 	 	a	few	 week 	 s 	 	ago	a	war	on	one	third	of	india	,	about	200	 di 	 strict 	 s 	 	that	he	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 un 	 govern 	 able 	 	,	he	 mis 	 s 	 ed 	 	the	point	.
the	point	that	we	have	 be 	 en 	 	 stress 	 ing 	 	for	the	last	21	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	point	that	people	may	be	 economic 	 ally 	 	poor	,	but	they	're	not	poor	in	the	mind	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	the	 mind 	 s 	 	on	the	margin	are	not	the	marginal	 mind 	 s 	 	.
that	is	the	 mess 	 age 	 	,	which	we	 start 	 ed 	 	31	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	what	did	it	start	?
let	me	just	tell	you	,	 brief 	 ly 	 	,	my	personal	journey	,	which	led	me	to	come	to	 th 	 is 	 	point	.
in	'85	,	'86	,	i	was	in	bangladesh	 ad 	 vis 	 ing 	 	the	government	and	the	research	council	there	how	to	help	 scientist 	 s 	 	work	on	the	 land 	 s 	 	,	on	the	 field 	 s 	 	of	the	poor	people	,	and	how	to	develop	research	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	which	are	based	on	the	knowledge	of	the	people	.
i	came	back	in	'86	.	i	had	 be 	 en 	 	 tremendous 	 ly 	 	 invigo 	 rated 	 	by	the	knowledge	and	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	that	i	found	in	that	country	,	which	had	60	percent	 land 	 lessness 	 	but	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	looking	at	my	own	work	:
the	work	that	i	had	 d 	 one 	 	for	the	previous	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	 al 	 most 	 	every	time	,	had	 in 	 stance 	 s 	 	of	knowledge	that	people	had	 share 	 d 	 	.
now	,	i	was	paid	in	 dollar 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 consult 	 ant 	 	,	and	i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	my	income	tax	return	and	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	ask	 my 	 self 	 	:	``	is	there	a	line	in	my	return	,	which	 show 	 s 	 	how	much	of	 th 	 is 	 	income	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	to	the	people	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	knowledge	 ha 	 s 	 	made	it	possible	?
was	it	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	 brilli 	 ant 	 	that	i	'm	 get 	 ting 	 	 th 	 is 	 	reward	,	or	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	revolution	?
is	it	that	i	write	 ver 	 y 	 	well	?
is	it	that	i	articulate	 ver 	 y 	 	well	?
is	it	that	i	 analyz 	 e 	 	the	data	 ver 	 y 	 	well	?
is	it	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	a	professor	,	and	,	 there 	 fore 	 	,	i	must	be	 en 	 titled 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	reward	from	 socie 	 ty 	 	?	``
i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	 con 	 vince 	 	 my 	 self 	 	that	,	``	no	,	no	,	i	have	 work 	 ed 	 	for	the	policy	 change 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	the	public	policy	will	 be 	 come 	 	more	 respons 	 ive 	 	to	the	 need 	 s 	 	of	the	poor	,	and	,	 there 	 fore 	 	i	think	it	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	``
but	it	 appear 	 ed 	 	to	me	that	all	these	 year 	 s 	 	that	i	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 exploit 	 ation 	 	--	 exploit 	 ation 	 	by	 land 	 lord 	 s 	 	,	by	 money 	 lender 	 s 	 	,	by	 trade 	 rs 	 	--	 g 	 ave 	 	me	an	 in 	 sight 	 	that	 prob 	 ably 	 	i	was	 al 	 so 	 	an	 exploit 	 er 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	was	no	line	in	my	income	tax	return	which	 show 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	income	 accrue 	 d 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 brilli 	 ance 	 	of	the	people	--	 t 	 hose 	 	people	who	have	 share 	 d 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	knowledge	and	good	faith	and	trust	with	me	--
and	 noth 	 ing 	 	ever	went	back	to	them	.	so	much	so	,	that	much	of	my	work	till	that	time	was	in	the	english	language	.
the	 major 	 ity 	 	of	the	people	from	whom	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	did	n't	know	english	.
so	what	kind	of	a	contributor	was	i	?
i	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	social	justice	,	and	here	i	was	,	a	professional	who	was	 pur 	 suing 	 	the	most	 un 	 just 	 	act	--	of	taking	knowledge	from	the	people	,	making	them	 anonym 	 ous 	 	,	 get 	 ting 	 	rent	from	that	knowledge	by	sharing	it	and	 do 	 ing 	 	 consult 	 ancy 	 	,	writing	 paper 	 s 	 	and	 publish 	 ing 	 	them	in	the	 paper 	 s 	 	,	 get 	 ting 	 	 invit 	 ed 	 	to	the	 con 	 ference 	 s 	 	,	 get 	 ting 	 	 consult 	 ancies 	 	and	 what 	 ever 	 	have	you	.
so	then	,	a	dilemma	rose	in	the	mind	that	,	if	i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	an	 exploit 	 er 	 	,	then	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	right	;
life	can	not	go	on	like	that	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	moment	of	great	pain	and	trauma	 be 	 cause 	 	i	could	n't	live	with	it	any	 long 	 er 	 	.
so	i	did	a	review	of	 ethic 	 al 	 	dilemma	and	value	 conflict 	 s 	 	and	management	research	,	wrote	,	read	about	100	 paper 	 s 	 	.
and	i	came	to	the	 con 	 clusion 	 	that	while	dilemma	is	 un 	 ique 	 	,	dilemma	is	not	 un 	 ique 	 	;	the	solution	had	to	be	 un 	 ique 	 	.
and	one	day	--	i	do	n't	know	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	--	while	coming	back	from	the	 off 	 ice 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	home	,	 may 	 be 	 	i	saw	a	honey	bee	or	it	 occur 	 red 	 	to	my	mind	that	if	i	 on 	 ly 	 	could	be	like	the	honey	bee	,	life	would	be	 wonder 	 ful 	 	.
what	the	honey	bee	 do 	 es 	 	:	it	 pollinat 	 es 	 	,	 take 	 s 	 	nectar	from	the	flower	,	 pollinat 	 es 	 	 an 	 other 	 	flower	,	cross	-	 pollinat 	 es 	 	.
and	when	it	 take 	 s 	 	the	nectar	,	the	 flower 	 s 	 	do	n't	feel	 short 	 change 	 d 	 	.
in	fact	,	they	 invit 	 e 	 	the	honey	bees	through	 the 	 ir 	 	 color 	 s 	 	,
and	the	bees	do	n't	keep	all	the	honey	for	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
these	are	the	three	 gui 	 d 	 ing 	 	 principle 	 s 	 	of	the	honey	bee	network	:
that	 when 	 ever 	 	we	learn	 some 	 thing 	 	from	people	it	must	be	 share 	 d 	 	with	them	in	 the 	 ir 	 	language	.
they	must	not	remain	 anonym 	 ous 	 	.
and	i	must	tell	you	that	after	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	have	not	made	one	percent	of	change	in	the	professional	practice	of	 th 	 is 	 	art	.
that	is	a	great	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	--	which	i	'm	 carry 	 ing 	 	still	with	me	and	i	hope	that	all	of	you	will	carry	 th 	 is 	 	with	you	--	that	the	profession	still	 legitimize 	 s 	 	 public 	 ation 	 	of	knowledge	of	people	 with 	 out 	 	 attribut 	 ing 	 	them	by	making	them	 anonym 	 ous 	 	.
the	research	 guide 	 lines 	 	of	u.s.	national	academy	of	 science 	 s 	 	or	research	 council 	 s 	 	of	the	u.k.	or	of	indian	 council 	 s 	 	of	science	research	do	not	 requir 	 e 	 	that	 what 	 ever 	 	you	learn	from	people	,	you	must	share	back	with	them	.
we	are	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	an	 account 	 able 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	that	is	fair	and	just	,
and	we	do	n't	even	do	justice	in	the	knowledge	market	.
and	india	 want 	 s 	 	to	be	a	knowledge	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
how	will	it	be	a	knowledge	 socie 	 ty 	 	?
so	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	you	can	not	have	two	 principle 	 s 	 	of	justice	,	one	for	 your 	 self 	 	and	one	for	 other 	 s 	 	.
it	must	be	the	same	.
you	can	not	discriminate	.
you	can	not	be	in	favor	of	your	own	 value 	 s 	 	,	which	are	at	a	distance	from	the	 value 	 s 	 	that	you	 e 	 spouse 	 	.
so	,	 fair 	 ness 	 	to	one	and	to	the	other	is	not	 di 	 visible 	 	.
look	at	 th 	 is 	 	picture	.
can	you	tell	me	where	 ha 	 s 	 	it	 be 	 en 	 	taken	from	,	and	what	is	it	 me 	 ant 	 	for	?	 any 	 body 	 	?
i	'm	a	professor	;	i	must	quiz	you	.
 any 	 body 	 	?	any	guess	at	all	?
 par 	 don 	 	?
anil	gupta	:	but	what	 ha 	 s 	 	it	 be 	 en 	 	used	for	?	what	 ha 	 s 	 	it	 be 	 en 	 	used	for	?
 par 	 don 	 	?
you	know	,	you	're	so	right	.	we	must	give	him	a	hand	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	man	 know 	 s 	 	how	 in 	 sensitive 	 	our	government	is	.
look	at	 th 	 is 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 s 	 ite 	 	of	the	government	of	india	.
it	 invit 	 es 	 	 tourist 	 s 	 	to	see	the	shame	of	our	country	.
i	'm	so	sorry	to	say	that	.
is	 th 	 is 	 	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	picture
or	is	it	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	picture	?
it	 depend 	 s 	 	 up 	 on 	 	how	you	look	at	the	life	of	the	people	.
if	 th 	 is 	 	woman	 ha 	 s 	 	to	carry	water	on	her	head	for	 mile 	 s 	 	and	 mile 	 s 	 	and	 mile 	 s 	 	,	you	can	not	be	 celebr 	 ating 	 	that	.
we	should	be	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	about	it	.
and	let	me	tell	you	,	with	all	the	science	and	technology	at	our	command	,	 million 	 s 	 	of	women	still	carry	water	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 head 	 s 	 	.
and	we	do	not	ask	 th 	 is 	 	question	.
you	must	have	taken	tea	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
think	for	a	minute	.
the	 leav 	 es 	 	of	the	tea	,	 pluck 	 ed 	 	from	the	 bush 	 es 	 	;	you	know	what	the	action	is	?	the	action	is	:
the	 lad 	 y 	 	 pick 	 s 	 	up	a	few	 leav 	 es 	 	,	 put 	 s 	 	them	in	the	basket	on	the	 back 	 side 	 	.
just	do	it	10	 time 	 s 	 	;	you	will	 real 	 ize 	 	the	pain	in	 th 	 is 	 	shoulder	.
and	she	 do 	 es 	 	it	a	few	thousand	 time 	 s 	 	every	day	.
the	rice	that	you	ate	in	the	lunch	,	and	you	will	eat	 to 	 day 	 	,	is	 transplant 	 ed 	 	by	women	 bend 	 ing 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	awkward	 post 	 ure 	 	,
 million 	 s 	 	of	them	,	every	season	,	in	the	 padd 	 y 	 	season	,	when	they	transplant	 padd 	 y 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	feet	in	the	water	.
and	feet	in	the	water	will	develop	fungus	,	 infect 	 ions 	 	,
and	that	 infect 	 ion 	 	 pain 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	then	other	 insect 	 s 	 	bite	that	point	.
and	every	year	,	99.9	percent	of	the	 padd 	 y 	 	is	 transplant 	 ed 	 	 manual 	 ly 	 	.
no	 machine 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	.
so	the	silence	of	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	of	 techno 	 logists 	 	,	of	public	policy	makers	,	of	the	change	agent	,	drew	our	attention	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	on	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	on	;	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	the	way	 socie 	 ty 	 	will	work	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	what	our	parliament	would	do	.	you	know	,
we	have	a	program	for	 employ 	 ment 	 	:
one	hundred	,	250	million	people	have	to	be	 give 	 n 	 	 job 	 s 	 	for	100	 day 	 s 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	great	country	.
 do 	 ing 	 	what	?	 break 	 ing 	 	 stone 	 s 	 	,	 dig 	 ging 	 	earth	.
so	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	a	question	to	the	parliament	:	do	poor	have	 head 	 s 	 	?
do	poor	have	 leg 	 s 	 	,	mouth	and	 hand 	 s 	 	,	but	no	head	?
so	honey	bee	network	 build 	 s 	 	 up 	 on 	 	the	resource	in	which	poor	people	are	rich	.
and	what	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	?
an	 anonym 	 ous 	 	,	 face 	 less 	 	,	 name 	 less 	 	person	 get 	 s 	 	in	contact	with	the	network	,	and	then	 get 	 s 	 	an	 ident 	 ity 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	honey	bee	network	is	about	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	network	grew	 volu 	 nt 	 arily 	 	,	 continu 	 es 	 	to	be	voluntary	,
and	 ha 	 s 	 	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	map	the	 mind 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	people	of	our	country	and	other	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	world	who	are	creative	.
they	could	be	creative	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	education	,
they	may	be	creative	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	culture	,
they	may	be	creative	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 institution 	 s 	 	;
but	a	lot	of	our	work	is	in	the	field	of	 techno 	 logical 	 	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	,	the	 innov 	 ations 	 	,	either	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	 innov 	 ations 	 	,	or	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 tradition 	 al 	 	knowledge	.
and	it	all	 begin 	 s 	 	with	curiosity	.
it	all	 begin 	 s 	 	with	curiosity	.
 th 	 is 	 	person	,	whom	we	met	--	and	you	will	see	it	on	the	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	 www. 	 sristi 	 .org 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	 trib 	 al 	 	person	,	he	had	a	wish	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	if	my	wish	 get 	 s 	 	 fulfill 	 ed 	 	``	--	 some 	 body 	 	was	sick	and	he	had	to	monitor	--	``	god	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	cure	him	.
and	if	you	cure	him	,	i	will	get	my	wall	 paint 	 ed 	 	.	``
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	he	got	 paint 	 ed 	 	.
 some 	 body 	 	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	 yester 	 day 	 	about	maslowian	 hierarch 	 y 	 	.
there	could	be	 noth 	 ing 	 	more	wrong	than	the	maslowian	model	of	 hierarch 	 y 	 	of	 need 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 poor 	 est 	 	people	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	can	get	 enlighten 	 ment 	 	.
kabir	,	rahim	,	all	the	great	sufi	 saint 	 s 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	all	poor	people	,	and	they	had	a	great	reason	.
 pleas 	 e 	 	do	not	ever	think	that	 on 	 ly 	 	after	 meet 	 ing 	 	your	 physiologic 	 al 	 	 need 	 s 	 	and	other	 need 	 s 	 	can	you	be	 think 	 ing 	 	about	your	spiritual	 need 	 s 	 	or	your	 enlighten 	 ment 	 	.
any	person	 any 	 where 	 	is	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 ris 	 ing 	 	to	that	highest	point	of	 attain 	 ment 	 	,	 on 	 ly 	 	by	the	 re 	 solve 	 	that	they	have	in	 the 	 ir 	 	mind	that	they	must	 achiev 	 e 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	.
look	at	 th 	 is 	 	.
we	saw	it	in	shodh	yatra	.	every	six	 month 	 s 	 	we	walk	in	different	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	country	.
i	've	 walk 	 ed 	 	about	4,000	 kilometer 	 s 	 	in	the	last	12	 year 	 s 	 	.
so	on	the	 way 	 side 	 	we	found	these	dung	 cake 	 s 	 	,	which	are	used	 a 	 s 	 	a	fuel	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	 lad 	 y 	 	,	on	the	wall	of	the	dung	cake	heap	,	 ha 	 s 	 	made	a	 paint 	 ing 	 	.
that	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	space	she	could	express	her	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	.
and	she	's	so	 marvel 	 ous 	 	.
look	at	 th 	 is 	 	 lad 	 y 	 	,	ram	timari	devi	,	on	a	grain	bin	.	in	champaran	,	we	had	a	shodh	yatra
and	we	 we 	 re 	 	 walk 	 ing 	 	in	the	land	where	gandhiji	went	to	hear	about	the	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	,	pain	of	 indi 	 go 	 	 grow 	 ers 	 	.
bhabi	mahato	in	purulia	and	bankura	.
look	at	what	she	 ha 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	.
the	whole	wall	is	her	canvas	.	she	's	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	with	a	 b 	 room 	 	.
is	she	an	artisan	or	an	artist	?
 obvious 	 ly 	 	she	's	an	artist	;	she	's	a	creative	person	.
if	we	can	create	 market 	 s 	 	for	these	 artist 	 s 	 	,	we	will	not	have	to	employ	them	for	 dig 	 ging 	 	earth	and	 break 	 ing 	 	 stone 	 s 	 	.
they	will	be	paid	for	what	they	are	good	at	,	not	what	they	're	bad	at	.
look	at	what	rojadeen	 ha 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	.
in	motihari	in	champaran	,	there	are	a	lot	of	people	who	sell	tea	on	the	 s 	 hack 	 	and	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	there	's	a	 limit 	 ed 	 	market	for	tea	.
every	 morn 	 ing 	 	you	have	tea	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	coffee	.
so	he	thought	,	why	do	n't	i	convert	a	pressure	 cook 	 er 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	coffee	machine	?
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	coffee	machine	.	just	 take 	 s 	 	a	few	hundred	 rupee 	 s 	 	.
people	 br 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 cook 	 er 	 	,	he	 attach 	 es 	 	a	 val 	 ve 	 	and	a	 s 	 team 	 	pipe	,	and	now	he	 give 	 s 	 	you	espresso	coffee	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	real	,	 afford 	 able 	 	coffee	 per 	 col 	 ator 	 	that	 work 	 s 	 	on	gas	.
look	at	what	sheikh	jahangir	 ha 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	.
a	lot	of	poor	people	do	not	have	 en 	 ough 	 	 grain 	 s 	 	to	get	ground	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	fellow	is	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	a	flour	-	 grind 	 ing 	 	machine	on	a	two	-	wheeler	.
if	you	have	500	 gram 	 s 	 	,	1000	,	one	 kilo 	 gram 	 	,	he	will	grind	it	for	it	for	you	;	the	 flour 	 mill 	 	will	not	grind	 s 	 uch 	 	a	small	 quant 	 ity 	 	.
 pleas 	 e 	 	understand	the	problem	of	poor	people	.
they	have	 need 	 s 	 	which	have	to	be	met	 efficient 	 ly 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	energy	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	cost	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	quality	.
they	do	n't	want	second	-	standard	,	second	-	quality	 out 	 put 	 s 	 	.
but	to	be	able	to	give	them	high	-	quality	 out 	 put 	 	you	need	to	adapt	technology	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 need 	 s 	 	.
and	that	is	what	sheikh	jahangir	did	.
but	that	's	not	 en 	 ough 	 	,	what	he	did	.	look	at	what	he	did	here	.
if	you	have	 clothe 	 s 	 	,	and	you	do	n't	have	 en 	 ough 	 	time	to	wash	them	,	he	 br 	 ought 	 	a	 wash 	 ing 	 	machine	to	your	 door 	 step 	 	,	 mount 	 ed 	 	on	a	two	-	wheeler	.
so	here	's	a	model	where	a	two	-	wheeler	 wash 	 ing 	 	machine	...	he	is	 wash 	 ing 	 	your	 clothe 	 s 	 	and	 dry 	 ing 	 	them	at	your	 door 	 step 	 	.
you	 br 	 ing 	 	your	water	,	you	 br 	 ing 	 	your	soap	,
i	wash	the	 clothe 	 s 	 	for	you	.	charge	50	 pa 	 isa 	 	,	one	rupee	for	you	per	lot	,
and	a	new	business	model	can	emerge	.
now	,	what	we	need	is	,	we	need	people	who	will	be	able	to	scale	them	up	.
look	at	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	photograph	.
but	you	know	what	it	is	?	can	 any 	 body 	 	guess	what	it	is	?
 some 	 body 	 	from	india	would	know	,	of	course	.
it	's	a	tawa	.
it	's	a	hot	plate	made	of	clay	.
now	,	what	is	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	in	it	?
when	you	have	a	non	-	stick	pan	,	it	 cost 	 s 	 	about	,	 may 	 be 	 	,	250	 rupee 	 s 	 	,	five	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	six	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	less	than	a	dollar
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	non	-	stick	;
it	is	 co 	 ated 	 	with	one	of	these	food	-	grade	 material 	 s 	 	.
and	the	best	part	is	that	,	while	you	use	a	 cost 	 ly 	 	non	-	stick	pan	,	you	eat	the	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	teflon	or	teflon	-	like	material	 be 	 cause 	 	after	some	time	the	stuff	 disappear 	 s 	 	.	where	 ha 	 s 	 	it	gone	?
it	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	in	your	stomach	.	it	was	not	 me 	 ant 	 	for	that	.
you	know	?	but	here	in	 th 	 is 	 	clay	hot	plate	,	it	will	never	go	 in 	 to 	 	your	stomach	.	so	it	is	better	,	it	is	 safe 	 r 	 	;	it	is	 afford 	 able 	 	,	it	is	energy	-	efficient	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	 solution 	 s 	 	by	the	poor	people	need	not	be	 cheap 	 er 	 	,	need	not	be	,	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	,	 jug 	 a 	 ad 	 	,	need	not	be	some	kind	of	 make 	 shift 	 	 arrange 	 ment 	 	.
they	have	to	be	better	,	they	have	to	be	more	efficient	,	they	have	to	be	 afford 	 able 	 	.
and	that	is	what	mansukh	bhai	prajapati	 ha 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	.
he	 ha 	 s 	 	designed	 th 	 is 	 	plate	with	a	handle	.
and	now	with	one	dollar	,	you	can	afford	a	better	 alter 	 native 	 	than	the	people	market	is	 off 	 er 	 ing 	 	you	.
 th 	 is 	 	 lad 	 y 	 	,	she	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	 herb 	 al 	 	 pest 	 icide 	 	 formula 	 tion 	 	.
we	 file 	 d 	 	the	patent	for	her	,	the	national	 innov 	 ation 	 	 found 	 ation 	 	.
and	who	 know 	 s 	 	?	 some 	 body 	 	will	 licens 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	technology	and	develop	 market 	 able 	 	 product 	 s 	 	,
and	she	would	get	revenue	.
now	,	let	me	 ment 	 ion 	 	one	thing	:
i	think	we	need	a	 poly 	 centric 	 	model	of	 develop 	 ment 	 	,	where	a	large	number	of	 initi 	 ative 	 s 	 	in	different	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	country	,	in	different	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	world	,	would	solve	the	 need 	 s 	 	of	 local 	 ity 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	efficient	and	 adapt 	 ive 	 	manner	.
 high 	 er 	 	the	local	fit	,	 great 	 er 	 	is	the	chance	of	 scal 	 ing 	 	up	.
in	the	 scal 	 ing 	 	up	,	there	's	an	inherent	 in 	 ad 	 equ 	 acy 	 	to	match	the	 need 	 s 	 	of	the	local	people	,	point	by	point	,	with	the	supply	that	you	're	making	.
so	why	are	people	 will 	 ing 	 	to	adjust	with	that	 mis 	 match 	 	?
 thing 	 s 	 	can	scale	up	,	and	they	have	 scale 	 d 	 	up	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	cell	 phone 	 s 	 	:	we	have	400	million	 cell 	 phone 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	.
now	,	it	is	possible	that	i	use	 on 	 ly 	 	two	 button 	 s 	 	on	the	 cell 	 phone 	 	,	 on 	 ly 	 	three	 option 	 s 	 	on	the	 cell 	 phone 	 	.	it	 ha 	 s 	 	300	 option 	 s 	 	,	i	'm	 pay 	 ing 	 	for	300	;	i	'm	using	 on 	 ly 	 	three
but	i	'm	 will 	 ing 	 	to	live	with	it	,	 there 	 fore 	 	it	is	 scal 	 ing 	 	up	.
but	if	i	had	to	get	a	match	to	match	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	i	would	need	a	different	design	of	a	 cell 	 phone 	 	.
so	what	we	're	 say 	 ing 	 	is	that	 scal 	 ability 	 	should	not	 be 	 come 	 	an	 ene 	 my 	 	of	 sustain 	 ability 	 	.
there	must	be	a	place	in	the	world	for	 solution 	 s 	 	that	are	 on 	 ly 	 	relevant	for	a	 local 	 ity 	 	,	and	yet	,	one	can	be	able	to	fund	them	.
one	of	the	 great 	 est 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	that	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 find 	 ing 	 	is	that	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	 invest 	 ors 	 	would	ask	 th 	 is 	 	question	--	``	what	is	a	 scal 	 able 	 	model	?	``	--
 a 	 s 	 	if	the	need	of	a	community	,	which	is	 on 	 ly 	 	 locate 	 d 	 	in	a	space	and	time	and	 ha 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 need 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 locate 	 d 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 place 	 s 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	no	legitimate	right	to	get	them	for	free	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	not	part	of	a	 large 	 r 	 	scale	.
so	either	you	sub	-	optimize	your	 need 	 s 	 	to	a	 large 	 r 	 	scale	or	else	you	remain	out	.
now	,	the	eminent	model	,	the	long	-	tail	model	 tell 	 s 	 	you	that	small	 sale 	 s 	 	of	a	large	number	of	 book 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	a	few	copies	 s 	 old 	 	can	still	be	a	 vi 	 able 	 	model	.
and	we	must	find	a	 mechan 	 ism 	 	where	people	will	pool	in	the	portfolio	,	will	invest	in	the	portfolio	,	where	different	 innov 	 ations 	 	will	go	to	a	small	number	of	people	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 local 	 ities 	 	,	and	yet	,	the	 over 	 all 	 	platform	of	the	model	will	 be 	 come 	 	 vi 	 able 	 	.
look	at	what	he	is	 do 	 ing 	 	.

and	we	have	not	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	 con 	 vince 	 	the	fire	brigade	people	in	mumbai	--	where	there	was	a	flood	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago
and	people	had	to	walk	20	 kilometer 	 s 	 	,	 wa 	 d 	 ing 	 	in	the	water	--

so	we	have	not	yet	 crack 	 ed 	 	the	problem	of	making	it	 avail 	 able 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 rescu 	 e 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 vend 	 ing 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	 flood 	 s 	 	in	eastern	india	,	when	you	have	to	deliver	 thing 	 s 	 	to	people	in	different	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	where	they	're	 mar 	 oon 	 ed 	 	.
