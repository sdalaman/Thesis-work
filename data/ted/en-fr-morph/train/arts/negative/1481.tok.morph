 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	have	 s 	 een 	 	the	film	``	moneyball	,	``	or	have	read	the	book	by	michael	lewis	,	will	be	familiar	with	the	story	of	billy	beane	.
billy	was	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	a	tremendous	ballplayer	;	all	the	 scout 	 s 	 	told	him	so	.
they	told	his	 parent 	 s 	 	that	they	 predict 	 ed 	 	that	he	was	going	to	be	a	star	.
but	what	 actual 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	when	he	 sign 	 ed 	 	the	contract	--	and	by	the	way	,	he	did	n't	want	to	sign	that	contract	,	he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	go	to	college	--	which	is	what	my	mother	,	who	 actual 	 ly 	 	 do 	 es 	 	love	me	,	 s 	 aid 	 	that	i	should	do	too	,	and	i	did	--	well	,	he	did	n't	do	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.	he	 struggle 	 d 	 	 might 	 ily 	 	.
he	got	 trade 	 d 	 	a	couple	of	 time 	 s 	 	,	he	 end 	 ed 	 	up	in	the	minors	for	most	of	his	 care 	 er 	 	,	and	he	 actual 	 ly 	 	 end 	 ed 	 	up	in	management	.	he	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 a 	 s 	 	a	general	 manage 	 r 	 	of	the	oakland	a	's	.
now	for	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	 end 	 ing 	 	up	in	management	,	which	is	 al 	 so 	 	what	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	,	is	 s 	 een 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	success	.
i	can	assure	you	that	for	a	kid	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	it	in	the	bigs	,	going	 in 	 to 	 	management	ai	n't	no	success	story	.	it	's	a	failure	.
and	what	i	want	to	talk	to	you	about	 to 	 day 	 	,	and	share	with	you	,	is	that	our	 health 	 care 	 	system	,	our	medical	system	,	is	just	 a 	 s 	 	bad	at	 predict 	 ing 	 	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	people	in	it	--	 patient 	 s 	 	,	 other 	 s 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 scout 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	at	 predict 	 ing 	 	what	would	happen	to	billy	beane	.
and	yet	,	every	day	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	are	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	with	 pre 	 condition 	 s 	 	.
we	hear	about	pre	-	 hyper 	 tension 	 	,	we	hear	about	pre	-	 de 	 ment 	 ia 	 	,	we	hear	about	pre	-	 anxie 	 ty 	 	,	and	i	'm	 pre 	 tty 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	that	i	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	 my 	 self 	 	with	that	in	the	green	room	.	we	 al 	 so 	 	refer	to	subclinical	 condition 	 s 	 	.
there	's	subclinical	atherosclerosis	,	subclinical	 hard 	 en 	 ing 	 	of	the	 arteri 	 es 	 	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	linked	to	heart	 attack 	 s 	 	,	 potential 	 ly 	 	.
one	of	my	 favor 	 ites 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	subclinical	 ac 	 ne 	 	.
if	you	look	up	subclinical	 ac 	 ne 	 	,	you	may	find	a	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	which	i	did	,	which	 say 	 s 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 eas 	 iest 	 	type	of	 ac 	 ne 	 	to	treat	.
you	do	n't	have	the	 pustu 	 les 	 	or	the	 red 	 ness 	 	and	 inflamm 	 ation 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	you	do	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	 ac 	 ne 	 	.
i	have	a	name	for	all	of	these	 condition 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 an 	 other 	 	 pre 	 condition 	 	:	i	call	them	preposterous	.
in	 base 	 ball 	 	,	the	game	 follow 	 s 	 	the	pre	-	game	.
season	 follow 	 s 	 	the	pre	-	season	.
but	with	a	lot	of	these	 condition 	 s 	 	,	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	is	n't	the	case	,	or	at	 l 	 east 	 	it	is	n't	the	case	all	the	time	.	it	's	 a 	 s 	 	if	there	's	a	rain	delay	,	every	single	time	in	 man 	 y 	 	 case 	 s 	 	.
we	have	pre	-	 cancer 	 ous 	 	 les 	 ions 	 	,	which	often	do	n't	turn	 in 	 to 	 	cancer	.
and	yet	,	if	you	take	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	subclinical	 osteo 	 poro 	 sis 	 	,	a	bone	 thin 	 ning 	 	disease	,	the	 pre 	 condition 	 	,	 other 	 wise 	 	known	 a 	 s 	 	osteopenia	,	you	would	have	to	treat	270	women	for	three	 year 	 s 	 	in	order	to	prevent	one	broken	bone	.
that	's	an	awful	lot	of	women	when	you	 multi 	 ply 	 	by	the	number	of	women	who	 we 	 re 	 	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	osteopenia	.
and	so	is	it	any	wonder	,	 give 	 n 	 	all	of	the	 cost 	 s 	 	and	the	side	 effect 	 s 	 	of	the	 drug 	 s 	 	that	we	're	using	to	treat	these	 pre 	 condition 	 s 	 	,	that	every	year	we	're	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	more	than	two	trillion	 dollar 	 s 	 	on	 health 	 care 	 	and	yet	100,000	people	a	year	--	and	that	's	a	 conserv 	 ative 	 	estimate	--	are	 dy 	 ing 	 	not	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 condition 	 s 	 	they	have	,	but	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 treat 	 ments 	 	that	we	're	giving	them	and	the	 complic 	 ations 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 treat 	 ments 	 	?
we	've	medicalized	 every 	 thing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	.
women	in	the	audience	,	i	have	some	 pre 	 tty 	 	bad	news	that	you	 al 	 ready 	 	know	,	and	that	's	that	every	 a 	 spect 	 	of	your	life	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	medicalized	.
strike	one	is	when	you	hit	puberty	.
you	now	have	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 happen 	 s 	 	to	you	once	a	month	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	medicalized	.
it	's	a	condition	;	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 treat 	 ed 	 	.	strike	two	is	if	you	get	 pregn 	 ant 	 	.
that	's	 be 	 en 	 	medicalized	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
you	have	to	have	a	high	-	tech	experience	of	 pregn 	 ancy 	 	,	 other 	 wise 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	might	go	wrong	.
strike	three	is	 men 	 o 	 pause 	 	.
we	all	know	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	when	 million 	 s 	 	of	women	 we 	 re 	 	 give 	 n 	 	hormone	 re 	 placement 	 	therapy	for	menopausal	 symptom 	 s 	 	for	 decade 	 s 	 	 un 	 til 	 	all	of	a	sudden	we	 real 	 ized 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	a	 stud 	 y 	 	came	out	,	a	big	one	,	nih	-	funded	.
it	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	a	lot	of	that	hormone	 re 	 placement 	 	therapy	may	be	 do 	 ing 	 	more	harm	than	good	for	 man 	 y 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	women	.
just	in	case	,	i	do	n't	want	to	 leav 	 e 	 	the	men	out	--	i	am	one	,	after	all	--	i	have	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	news	for	all	of	you	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	and	for	 every 	 one 	 	 listen 	 ing 	 	and	 watch 	 ing 	 	 else 	 where 	 	:	you	all	have	a	 universal 	 ly 	 	fatal	condition	.
so	,	just	take	a	moment	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	pre	-	death	.
every	single	one	of	you	 ha 	 s 	 	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	have	the	risk	factor	for	it	,	which	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 al 	 ive 	 	.
but	i	have	some	good	news	for	you	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	a	journalist	,	i	like	to	end	 thing 	 s 	 	in	a	happy	way	or	a	forward	-	 think 	 ing 	 	way	.
and	that	good	news	is	that	if	you	can	 surviv 	 e 	 	to	the	end	of	my	talk	,	which	we	'll	see	if	that	 happen 	 s 	 	for	 every 	 one 	 	,	you	will	be	a	pre	-	vivor	.
i	made	up	pre	-	death	.
if	i	used	 some 	 one 	 	else	's	pre	-	death	,	i	 apolog 	 ize 	 	,	i	think	i	made	it	up	.
i	did	n't	make	up	pre	-	vivor	.
pre	-	vivor	is	what	a	 part 	 icular 	 	cancer	 advoc 	 acy 	 	group	would	like	 every 	 one 	 	who	just	 ha 	 s 	 	a	risk	factor	,	but	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	that	cancer	,	to	call	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
you	are	a	pre	-	vivor	.
we	've	had	hbo	here	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	.	i	'm	 wonder 	 ing 	 	if	mark	burnett	is	 any 	 where 	 	in	the	audience	,	i	'd	like	to	suggest	a	 re 	 ality 	 	tv	show	 call 	 ed 	 	``	pre	-	vivor	.	``
if	you	develop	a	disease	,	you	're	off	the	 is 	 land 	 	.
but	the	problem	is	,	we	have	a	system	that	is	 complete 	 ly 	 	--	 bas 	 ically 	 	 promote 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
we	've	 select 	 ed 	 	,	at	every	point	in	 th 	 is 	 	system	,	to	do	what	we	do	,	and	to	give	 every 	 one 	 	a	 pre 	 condition 	 	and	then	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	a	condition	,	in	some	 case 	 s 	 	.
start	with	the	doctor	-	patient	relationship	.	 doctor 	 s 	 	,	most	of	them	,	are	in	a	fee	-	for	-	service	system	.	they	are	 bas 	 ically 	 	 incentivize 	 d 	 	to	do	more	--	 procedure 	 s 	 	,	 test 	 s 	 	,	 pre 	 scribe 	 	 medic 	 ations 	 	.
 patient 	 s 	 	come	to	them	,	they	want	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	.	we	're	americans	,	we	ca	n't	just	stand	there	,	we	have	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	.	and	so	they	want	a	drug	.
they	want	a	 treat 	 ment 	 	.	they	want	to	be	told	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	you	have	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	you	treat	it	.	if	the	doctor	 do 	 es 	 	n't	give	you	that	,	you	go	 some 	 where 	 	else	.
that	's	not	 ver 	 y 	 	good	for	 doctor 	 s 	 	'	business	.
or	even	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	if	you	are	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	with	 some 	 thing 	 	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	and	the	doctor	did	n't	order	that	test	,	you	get	 su 	 ed 	 	.
we	have	pharmaceutical	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	that	are	 constant 	 ly 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	expand	the	 indic 	 ations 	 	,	expand	the	number	of	people	who	are	eligible	for	a	 give 	 n 	 	 treat 	 ment 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 help 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	bottom	line	.	we	have	 advoc 	 acy 	 	 group 	 s 	 	,	like	the	one	that	's	come	up	with	pre	-	vivor	,	who	want	to	make	more	and	more	people	feel	they	are	at	risk	,	or	might	have	a	condition	,	so	that	they	can	raise	more	 fund 	 s 	 	and	raise	 vis 	 ibility 	 	,	et	 ce 	 tera 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 de 	 spite 	 	what	 journalist 	 s 	 	 typical 	 ly 	 	do	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	about	 b 	 lam 	 ing 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	 player 	 s 	 	.
we	are	all	 respons 	 ible 	 	.
i	'm	 respons 	 ible 	 	.
i	 actual 	 ly 	 	root	for	the	yankees	,	i	mean	talk	about	 root 	 ing 	 	for	the	worst	possible	offender	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	 do 	 ing 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	you	can	do	.
thank	you	.
but	 every 	 one 	 	is	 respons 	 ible 	 	.
i	went	to	medical	school	,	and	i	did	n't	have	a	course	 call 	 ed 	 	how	to	think	skeptically	,	or	how	not	to	order	 test 	 s 	 	.
we	have	 th 	 is 	 	system	where	that	's	what	you	do	.
and	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	took	 be 	 ing 	 	a	journalist	to	understand	all	these	 incentive 	 s 	 	.	you	know	,	 economist 	 s 	 	like	to	say	,	there	are	no	bad	people	,	there	are	just	bad	 incentive 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	true	.
 be 	 cause 	 	what	we	've	 create 	 d 	 	is	a	sort	of	field	of	 dream 	 s 	 	,	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	medical	technology	.
so	when	you	put	 an 	 other 	 	mri	in	every	corner	,	you	put	a	robot	in	every	hospital	 say 	 ing 	 	that	 every 	 one 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	have	robotic	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	.
well	,	we	've	 create 	 d 	 	a	system	where	if	you	build	it	,	they	will	come	.
but	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	 per 	 verse 	 ly 	 	tell	people	to	come	,	 con 	 vince 	 	them	that	they	have	to	come	.
it	was	when	i	 be 	 came 	 	a	journalist	that	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 real 	 ized 	 	how	i	was	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	problem	,	and	how	we	all	are	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	problem	.
i	was	medicalizing	every	risk	factor	,	i	was	writing	 st 	 ories 	 	,	 commission 	 ing 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	,	every	day	,	that	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	,	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	make	people	 worri 	 ed 	 	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	that	was	what	often	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
but	,	you	know	,	there	are	ways	out	.
i	saw	my	own	 intern 	 ist 	 	last	week	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	``	you	know	,	``	and	he	told	me	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 every 	 one 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	audience	could	have	told	me	for	free	,	but	i	paid	him	for	the	privilege	,	which	is	that	i	need	to	lose	some	weight	.
well	,	he	's	right	.	i	've	had	honest	-	to	-	 good 	 ness 	 	high	blood	pressure	for	a	dozen	 year 	 s 	 	now	,	same	age	my	father	got	it	,	and	it	's	a	real	disease	.	it	's	not	pre	-	 hyper 	 tension 	 	,	it	's	actual	 hyper 	 tension 	 	,	high	blood	pressure	.
well	,	he	's	right	,	but	he	did	n't	say	to	me	,	well	,	you	have	pre	-	 obes 	 ity 	 	or	you	have	pre	-	diabetes	,	or	 any 	 thing 	 	like	that	.	he	did	n't	say	,	better	start	taking	 th 	 is 	 	statin	,	you	need	to	lower	your	cholesterol	.
no	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	go	out	and	lose	some	weight	.	come	back	and	see	me	in	a	bit	,	or	just	give	me	a	call	and	let	me	know	how	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	.	``
so	that	's	,	to	me	,	a	way	forward	.
billy	beane	,	by	the	way	,	 learn 	 ed 	 	the	same	thing	.
he	 learn 	 ed 	 	,	from	 watch 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	kid	who	he	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 hire 	 d 	 	,	who	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	for	him	,	that	it	was	n't	 s 	 wing 	 ing 	 	for	the	 f 	 ence 	 s 	 	,	it	was	n't	 s 	 wing 	 ing 	 	at	every	pitch	like	the	sluggers	do	,	which	is	what	all	the	expensive	 team 	 s 	 	like	the	yankees	like	to	--	they	like	to	pick	up	 t 	 hose 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	kid	told	him	,	you	know	,	you	got	ta	watch	the	 guy 	 s 	 	,	and	you	got	ta	go	out	and	find	the	 guy 	 s 	 	who	like	to	walk	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	on	base	by	a	walk	is	just	 a 	 s 	 	good	,	and	in	our	 health 	 care 	 	system	we	need	to	figure	out	,	is	that	 re 	 ally 	 	a	good	pitch	or	should	we	let	it	go	by	and	not	 s 	 wing 	 	at	 every 	 thing 	 	?
 thank 	 s 	 	.
