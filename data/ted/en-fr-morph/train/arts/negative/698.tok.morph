it	's	a	bit	funny	to	be	at	a	 con 	 ference 	 	 dedicate 	 d 	 	to	 thing 	 s 	 	not	 s 	 een 	 	,	and	present	my	proposal	to	build	a	6,000	-	kilometer	-	long	wall	 a 	 cross 	 	the	entire	african	continent	.
about	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	great	wall	of	 chin 	 a 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	would	 hard 	 ly 	 	be	an	 in 	 visible 	 	structure	.
and	yet	it	's	made	from	 part 	 s 	 	that	are	 in 	 visible 	 	,	or	near	-	 in 	 visible 	 	,	to	the	naked	eye	:	bacteria	and	 grain 	 s 	 	of	sand	.
now	,	 a 	 s 	 	 architect 	 s 	 	we	're	trained	to	solve	 problem 	 s 	 	.
but	i	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	in	 architect 	 ural 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	;	i	 on 	 ly 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	in	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	.
which	is	why	i	'll	show	you	a	threat	,	and	an	 architect 	 ural 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	.
the	threat	is	 desert 	 ification 	 	.
my	 respons 	 e 	 	is	a	 sand 	 stone 	 	wall	made	from	bacteria	and	 solid 	 ified 	 	sand	,	 stretch 	 ing 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	desert	.
now	,	sand	is	a	 magic 	 al 	 	material	of	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 contradict 	 ions 	 	.
it	is	simple	and	complex	.
it	is	 peace 	 ful 	 	and	violent	.
it	is	 al 	 ways 	 	the	same	,	never	the	same	,	 end 	 lessly 	 	 fasci 	 nating 	 	.
one	billion	 grain 	 s 	 	of	sand	come	 in 	 to 	 	 exist 	 ence 	 	in	the	world	each	second	.
that	's	a	 cycl 	 ical 	 	process	.
 a 	 s 	 	 rock 	 s 	 	and	 mountain 	 s 	 	die	,	 grain 	 s 	 	of	sand	are	born	.
some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 grain 	 s 	 	may	then	cement	 natural 	 ly 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 sand 	 stone 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	the	 sand 	 stone 	 	 weather 	 s 	 	,	new	 grain 	 s 	 	break	free	.
some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 grain 	 s 	 	may	then	 accumul 	 ate 	 	on	a	massive	scale	,	 in 	 to 	 	a	sand	dune	.
in	a	way	,	the	static	,	stone	mountain	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	moving	mountain	of	sand	.
but	,	moving	 mountain 	 s 	 	can	be	 danger 	 ous 	 	.	let	me	try	and	explain	why	.
dry	 area 	 s 	 	cover	more	than	one	third	of	the	earth	's	land	 surface 	 s 	 	.
some	are	 al 	 ready 	 	 desert 	 s 	 	;	 other 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 serious 	 ly 	 	 de 	 grad 	 ed 	 	by	the	sand	.
just	south	of	the	sahara	we	find	the	sahel	.
the	name	 mean 	 s 	 	``	edge	of	the	desert	.	``
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	region	most	 close 	 ly 	 	 associate 	 d 	 	with	 desert 	 ification 	 	.
it	was	here	in	the	late	'60s	and	early	'70s	that	major	 drought 	 s 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	three	million	people	to	 be 	 come 	 	dependent	 up 	 on 	 	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	food	aid	,	with	about	up	to	250,000	 dy 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 catastroph 	 e 	 	 wait 	 ing 	 	to	happen	 aga 	 in 	 	.	and	it	's	one	that	 get 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	little	attention	.
in	our	 accele 	 rated 	 	media	culture	,	 desert 	 ification 	 	is	 simpl 	 y 	 	too	 s 	 low 	 	to	reach	the	 head 	 lines 	 	.
it	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	like	a	tsunami	or	a	katrina	:	too	few	 cry 	 ing 	 	children	and	 s 	 mash 	 ed 	 	up	 house 	 s 	 	.
and	yet	 desert 	 ification 	 	is	a	major	threat	on	all	 continent 	 s 	 	,	 affect 	 ing 	 	some	110	 count 	 ries 	 	and	about	70	percent	of	the	world	's	 agricultur 	 al 	 	 dry 	 land 	 s 	 	.
it	 serious 	 ly 	 	 threaten 	 s 	 	the	 livelihood 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	people	,	and	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	in	africa	and	 chin 	 a 	 	.
and	it	is	 large 	 ly 	 	an	issue	that	we	've	 create 	 d 	 	for	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	through	 un 	 sustain 	 able 	 	use	of	scarce	 resource 	 s 	 	.
so	,	we	get	climate	change	.
we	get	 drought 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	 desert 	 ification 	 	,	 crash 	 ing 	 	food	 system 	 s 	 	,	water	 scar 	 city 	 	,	famine	,	 force 	 d 	 	 migr 	 ation 	 	,	 politic 	 al 	 	 in 	 st 	 ability 	 	,	 war 	 fare 	 	,	crisis	.
that	's	a	potential	scenario	if	we	fail	to	take	 th 	 is 	 	 serious 	 ly 	 	.
but	,	how	far	away	is	it	?
i	went	to	sokoto	in	 north 	 ern 	 	nigeria	to	try	and	find	out	how	far	away	it	is	.
the	 dune 	 s 	 	here	move	 south 	 ward 	 	at	a	pace	of	around	600	 meter 	 s 	 	a	year	.
that	's	the	sahara	eating	up	 al 	 most 	 	[	two	 meter 	 s 	 	]	a	day	of	the	 ar 	 able 	 	land	,	 physical 	 ly 	 	 push 	 ing 	 	people	away	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 home 	 s 	 	.
here	i	am	--	i	'm	the	second	person	on	the	left	--	with	the	 elder 	 s 	 	in	gidan	-	kara	,	a	 tin 	 y 	 	village	 out 	 side 	 	of	sokoto	.
they	had	to	move	 th 	 is 	 	village	in	1987	 a 	 s 	 	a	huge	dune	 threaten 	 ed 	 	to	swallow	it	.
so	,	they	 move 	 d 	 	the	entire	village	,	hut	by	hut	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	where	the	village	used	to	be	.
it	took	us	about	10	 minute 	 s 	 	to	climb	up	to	the	top	of	that	dune	,
which	 go 	 es 	 	to	show	why	they	had	to	move	to	a	 safe 	 r 	 	location	.
that	's	the	kind	of	 force 	 d 	 	 migr 	 ation 	 	that	 desert 	 ification 	 	can	lead	to	.
if	you	happen	to	live	close	to	the	desert	border	,	you	can	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 calcul 	 ate 	 	how	long	it	will	be	before	you	have	to	carry	your	 kid 	 s 	 	away	,	and	abandon	your	home	and	your	life	 a 	 s 	 	you	know	it	.
now	,	sand	 dune 	 s 	 	cover	 on 	 ly 	 	about	one	fifth	of	our	 desert 	 s 	 	.	and	still	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 	 environment 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 place 	 s 	 	if	we	want	to	stop	the	shifting	 sand 	 s 	 	.
four	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	23	african	 count 	 ries 	 	came	together	to	create	the	great	green	wall	sahara	.
a	fantastic	project	,	the	 initi 	 al 	 	plan	 call 	 ed 	 	for	a	shelter	belt	of	 tree 	 s 	 	to	be	 plant 	 ed 	 	right	 a 	 cross 	 	the	african	continent	,	from	mauritania	in	the	west	,	all	the	way	to	djibouti	in	the	east	.
if	you	want	to	stop	a	sand	dune	from	moving	,	what	you	need	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	to	do	is	to	stop	the	 grain 	 s 	 	from	 avalanch 	 ing 	 	over	 it 	 s 	 	crest	.
and	a	good	way	of	 do 	 ing 	 	that	,	the	most	efficient	way	,	is	to	use	some	kind	of	sand	 catch 	 er 	 	.
 tree 	 s 	 	or	cacti	are	good	for	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	,	one	of	the	 problem 	 s 	 	with	 plant 	 ing 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	is	that	the	people	in	these	 region 	 s 	 	are	so	poor	that	they	chop	them	down	for	 fire 	 wood 	 	.
now	there	is	an	 alter 	 native 	 	to	just	 plant 	 ing 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	and	 hop 	 ing 	 	that	they	wo	n't	get	 chop 	 ped 	 	down	.
 th 	 is 	 	 sand 	 stone 	 	wall	that	i	'm	 pro 	 posing 	 	 essential 	 ly 	 	 do 	 es 	 	three	 thing 	 s 	 	.
it	 add 	 s 	 	 rough 	 ness 	 	to	the	dune	's	surface	,	to	the	 text 	 ure 	 	of	the	dune	's	surface	,	 bind 	 ing 	 	the	 grain 	 s 	 	.
it	 provide 	 s 	 	a	physical	support	structure	for	the	 tree 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 create 	 s 	 	physical	 space 	 s 	 	,	 habit 	 able 	 	 space 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	of	the	sand	 dune 	 s 	 	.
if	people	live	 in 	 side 	 	of	the	green	 bar 	 rier 	 	they	can	help	support	the	 tree 	 s 	 	,	protect	them	from	 human 	 s 	 	,	and	from	some	of	the	 force 	 s 	 	of	nature	.
 in 	 side 	 	of	the	 dune 	 s 	 	we	find	 sha 	 de 	 	.
we	can	start	 harvest 	 ing 	 	 condens 	 ation 	 	,	and	start	 green 	 ing 	 	the	desert	from	 with 	 in 	 	.
sand	 dune 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 most 	 	like	ready	-	made	 building 	 s 	 	in	a	way	.
all	we	need	to	do	is	 solid 	 ify 	 	the	 part 	 s 	 	that	we	need	to	be	solid	,	and	then	 excav 	 ate 	 	the	sand	,	and	we	have	our	 architect 	 ure 	 	.
we	can	either	 excav 	 ate 	 	it	by	hand	or	we	can	have	the	wind	 excav 	 ate 	 	it	for	us	.
so	,	the	wind	 car 	 ries 	 	the	sand	onto	the	 s 	 ite 	 	and	then	it	 car 	 ries 	 	the	 red 	 un 	 d 	 ant 	 	sand	away	from	the	structure	for	us	.
but	,	by	now	,	you	're	 prob 	 ably 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	,	how	am	i	 plan 	 ning 	 	to	 solid 	 ify 	 	a	sand	dune	?
how	do	we	glue	 t 	 hose 	 	 grain 	 s 	 	of	sand	together	?
and	the	answer	is	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	that	you	use	these	 guy 	 s 	 	,	bacillus	 paste 	 urii 	 	,	a	micro	-	organism	that	is	 read 	 ily 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	in	 wet 	 land 	 s 	 	and	 marsh 	 es 	 	,	and	 do 	 es 	 	 precise 	 ly 	 	that	.
it	 take 	 s 	 	a	pile	of	loose	sand	and	it	 create 	 s 	 	 sand 	 stone 	 	out	of	it	.
these	 image 	 s 	 	from	the	american	 socie 	 ty 	 	for	 micro 	 biology 	 	show	us	the	process	.
what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	,	you	pour	bacillus	 paste 	 urii 	 	onto	a	pile	of	sand	,	and	it	 start 	 s 	 	 fill 	 ing 	 	up	the	 void 	 s 	 	in	between	the	 grain 	 s 	 	.
a	chemical	process	 produce 	 s 	 	 calc 	 ite 	 	,	which	is	a	kind	of	natural	cement	that	 bind 	 s 	 	the	 grain 	 s 	 	together	.
the	whole	 cement 	 ation 	 	process	 take 	 s 	 	about	24	 hour 	 s 	 	.
i	 learn 	 ed 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	from	a	professor	at	u.c	.	davis	 call 	 ed 	 	jason	dejong	.
he	 manage 	 d 	 	to	do	it	in	a	mere	1,400	 minute 	 s 	 	.
here	i	am	,	 play 	 ing 	 	the	part	of	the	mad	scientist	,	 work 	 ing 	 	with	the	 bug 	 s 	 	at	ucl	in	london	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 solid 	 ify 	 	them	.
so	,	how	much	would	 th 	 is 	 	cost	?
i	'm	not	an	economist	,	 ver 	 y 	 	much	not	,	but	i	did	,	 quit 	 e 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	a	back	of	the	 envelop 	 e 	 	 calcul 	 ation 	 	--	--	and	it	 seem 	 s 	 	that	for	a	cubic	meter	of	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	we	would	have	to	pay	in	the	region	of	90	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
and	,	after	an	 initi 	 al 	 	cost	of	60	 buck 	 s 	 	to	buy	the	bacteria	,	which	you	'll	never	have	to	pay	 aga 	 in 	 	,	one	cubic	meter	of	bacterial	sand	would	be	about	11	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
how	do	we	construct	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	?
well	,	i	'll	 quick 	 ly 	 	show	you	two	 option 	 s 	 	.
the	first	is	to	create	a	kind	of	balloon	structure	,	fill	it	with	bacteria	,	then	allow	the	sand	to	wash	over	the	balloon	,	pop	the	balloon	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 we 	 re 	 	,	 dis 	 semi 	 nating 	 	the	bacteria	 in 	 to 	 	the	sand	and	 solid 	 ifying 	 	it	.
then	,	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	using	 perma 	 cultural 	 	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	,	we	green	that	part	of	the	desert	.
the	second	 alter 	 native 	 	would	be	to	use	 inject 	 ion 	 	 pile 	 s 	 	.
so	,	we	 push 	 ed 	 	the	 pile 	 s 	 	down	through	the	dune	,	and	we	create	an	 initi 	 al 	 	bacterial	surface	.
we	then	pull	the	 pile 	 s 	 	up	through	the	dune	and	we	're	able	to	create	 al 	 most 	 	any	 conceiv 	 able 	 	shape	 in 	 side 	 	of	the	sand	with	the	sand	 act 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	mold	 a 	 s 	 	we	go	up	.
so	,	we	have	a	way	of	 turn 	 ing 	 	sand	 in 	 to 	 	 sand 	 stone 	 	,	and	then	creating	these	 habit 	 able 	 	 space 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	of	the	desert	 dune 	 s 	 	.
but	,	what	should	they	look	like	?
well	,	i	was	inspired	,	for	my	 architect 	 ural 	 	form	,	by	tafoni	,	which	look	a	little	bit	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	model	 represent 	 ation 	 	of	it	.
these	are	 cavern 	 ous 	 	rock	 structure 	 s 	 	that	i	found	on	the	 s 	 ite 	 	in	sokoto	.
and	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	if	i	 scale 	 d 	 	them	up	,	they	would	provide	me	with	good	spatial	 qual 	 ities 	 	,	for	 ventil 	 ation 	 	,	for	thermal	comfort	,	and	for	other	 thing 	 s 	 	.
now	,	part	of	the	 form 	 al 	 	control	over	 th 	 is 	 	structure	would	be	lost	to	nature	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	bacteria	do	 the 	 ir 	 	work	.
and	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	 create 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	 bound 	 less 	 	 beaut 	 y 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
i	think	there	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	in	that	 articul 	 ation 	 	that	is	 quit 	 e 	 	nice	.
we	see	the	result	,	the	 trace 	 s 	 	,	if	you	like	,	of	the	bacillus	 paste 	 urii 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 harness 	 ed 	 	to	sculpt	the	desert	 in 	 to 	 	these	 habit 	 able 	 	 environment 	 s 	 	.
some	people	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	would	spread	 un 	 controll 	 ably 	 	,	and	that	the	bacteria	would	kill	 every 	 thing 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	way	.
that	's	not	true	at	all	.
it	's	a	natural	process	.	it	 go 	 es 	 	on	in	nature	 to 	 day 	 	,
and	the	bacteria	die	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	we	stop	 feed 	 ing 	 	them	.
so	,	there	it	is	--	 architect 	 ural 	 	anti	-	 desert 	 ification 	 	 structure 	 s 	 	made	from	the	desert	 it 	 self 	 	.
sand	-	 stop 	 ping 	 	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	,	made	from	sand	.
the	world	is	 like 	 ly 	 	to	lose	one	third	of	 it 	 s 	 	 ar 	 able 	 	land	by	the	end	of	the	century	.
in	a	period	of	unprecedented	population	growth	and	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	food	 demand 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	could	prove	 dis 	 astro 	 us 	 	.
and	 quit 	 e 	 	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	we	're	 put 	 ting 	 	our	 head 	 s 	 	in	the	sand	.
if	 noth 	 ing 	 	else	,	i	would	like	for	 th 	 is 	 	scheme	to	 initi 	 ate 	 	a	 discuss 	 ion 	 	.
but	,	if	i	had	 some 	 thing 	 	like	a	ted	wish	,	it	would	be	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	it	built	,	to	start	building	 th 	 is 	 	 habit 	 able 	 	wall	,	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	long	,	but	 ver 	 y 	 	narrow	city	in	the	desert	,	built	 in 	 to 	 	the	 dune 	 s 	 cape 	 	 it 	 self 	 	.
it	's	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 support 	 s 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	,	but	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 connect 	 s 	 	people	and	 count 	 ries 	 	together	.
i	would	like	to	conclude	by	 show 	 ing 	 	you	an	 anim 	 ation 	 	of	the	structure	,	and	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	a	sentence	by	jorge	luis	borges	.
borges	 s 	 aid 	 	that	``	 noth 	 ing 	 	is	built	on	stone	,	 every 	 thing 	 	is	built	on	sand	,	but	we	must	build	 a 	 s 	 	if	the	sand	 we 	 re 	 	stone	.	``
now	,	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 detail 	 s 	 	left	to	explore	in	 th 	 is 	 	scheme	--	 politic 	 al 	 	,	practical	,	 ethic 	 al 	 	,	financial	.
my	design	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 take 	 s 	 	you	down	the	 rabbi 	 t 	 	hole	,	is	 frau 	 ght 	 	with	 man 	 y 	 	 challeng 	 es 	 	and	 difficult 	 ies 	 	in	the	real	world	.
but	,	it	's	a	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	it	's	a	vision	.
 a 	 s 	 	borges	would	have	it	,	it	's	the	sand	.
and	i	think	now	is	 re 	 ally 	 	the	time	to	turn	it	 in 	 to 	 	stone	.	thank	you	.
