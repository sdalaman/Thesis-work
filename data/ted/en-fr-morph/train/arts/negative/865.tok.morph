i	was	here	four	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	i	remember	,	at	the	time	,	that	the	 talk 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	n't	put	 on 	 line 	 	.	i	think	they	 we 	 re 	 	 give 	 n 	 	to	tedsters	in	a	box	,	a	box	set	of	dvds	,	which	they	put	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 shelv 	 es 	 	,	where	they	are	now	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	chris	 call 	 ed 	 	me	a	week	after	i	'd	 give 	 n 	 	my	talk	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	're	going	to	start	 put 	 ting 	 	them	 on 	 line 	 	.
can	we	put	 your 	 s 	 	 on 	 line 	 	?	``	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 s 	 ure 	 	.	``
and	four	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 een 	 	by	four	...
well	,	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 download 	 ed 	 	four	million	 time 	 s 	 	.
so	i	suppose	you	could	 multi 	 ply 	 	that	by	20	or	 some 	 thing 	 	to	get	the	number	of	people	who	've	 s 	 een 	 	it	.
and	,	 a 	 s 	 	chris	 say 	 s 	 	,	there	is	a	 hung 	 er 	 	for	 video 	 s 	 	of	me	.
...	do	n't	you	feel	?
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	whole	event	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	an	elaborate	build	-	up	to	me	 do 	 ing 	 	 an 	 other 	 	one	for	you	,	so	here	it	is	.
al	gore	spoke	at	the	ted	 con 	 ference 	 	i	spoke	at	four	 year 	 s 	 	ago	and	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	the	climate	crisis	.
and	i	 re 	 ference 	 d 	 	that	at	the	end	of	my	last	talk	.
so	i	want	to	pick	up	from	there	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 on 	 ly 	 	had	18	 minute 	 s 	 	,	 frank 	 ly 	 	.
so	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	was	 say 	 ing 	 	...
you	see	,	he	's	right	.
i	mean	,	there	is	a	major	climate	crisis	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,
and	i	think	if	people	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	it	,	they	should	get	out	more	.	but	i	 believ 	 e 	 	there	's	a	second	climate	crisis	,	which	is	 a 	 s 	 	severe	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	the	same	 origin 	 s 	 	,	and	that	we	have	to	deal	with	with	the	same	 urge 	 ncy 	 	.
and	i	mean	by	 th 	 is 	 	--	and	you	may	say	,	by	the	way	,	``	look	,	i	'm	good	.	i	have	one	climate	crisis	;	i	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	need	the	second	one	.	``
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	crisis	of	,	not	natural	 resource 	 s 	 	--	 th 	 ough 	 	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	's	true	--	but	a	crisis	of	human	 resource 	 s 	 	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 speaker 	 s 	 	have	 s 	 aid 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	past	few	 day 	 s 	 	,	that	we	make	 ver 	 y 	 	poor	use	of	our	 talent 	 s 	 	.
 ver 	 y 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	go	through	 the 	 ir 	 	whole	 live 	 s 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	no	real	sense	of	what	 the 	 ir 	 	 talent 	 s 	 	may	be	,	or	if	they	have	any	to	speak	of	.
i	meet	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	people	who	do	n't	think	they	're	 re 	 ally 	 	good	at	 any 	 thing 	 	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	kind	of	divide	the	world	 in 	 to 	 	two	 group 	 s 	 	now	.
jeremy	bentham	,	the	great	 util 	 itarian 	 	 philosoph 	 er 	 	,	once	 spike 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	argument	.	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	there	are	two	 type 	 s 	 	of	people	in	 th 	 is 	 	world	:	 t 	 hose 	 	who	divide	the	world	 in 	 to 	 	two	 type 	 s 	 	and	 t 	 hose 	 	who	do	not	.	``
well	,	i	do	.
i	meet	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	people	who	do	n't	enjoy	what	they	do	.
they	 simpl 	 y 	 	go	through	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	on	with	it	.
they	get	no	great	pleasure	from	what	they	do	.
they	 endur 	 e 	 	it	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	enjoy	it	and	wait	for	the	 week 	 end 	 	.
but	i	 al 	 so 	 	meet	people	who	love	what	they	do	and	could	n't	imagine	 do 	 ing 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	else	.
if	you	 s 	 aid 	 	to	them	,	``	do	n't	do	 th 	 is 	 	 any 	 more 	 	,	``	they	'd	wonder	what	you	 we 	 re 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	n't	what	they	do	,	it	's	who	they	are	.	they	say	,	``	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	me	,	you	know	.
it	would	be	 fool 	 ish 	 	for	me	to	abandon	 th 	 is 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 speak 	 s 	 	to	my	most	authentic	self	.	``
and	it	's	not	true	of	 en 	 ough 	 	people	.
in	fact	,	on	the	 contr 	 ary 	 	,	i	think	it	's	still	true	of	a	 minor 	 ity 	 	of	people	.
i	think	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	possible	 explan 	 ations 	 	for	it	.
and	high	among	them	is	education	,	 be 	 cause 	 	education	,	in	a	way	,	 dis 	 locate 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	from	 the 	 ir 	 	natural	 talent 	 s 	 	.
and	human	 resource 	 s 	 	are	like	natural	 resource 	 s 	 	;	they	're	often	buried	deep	.
you	have	to	go	looking	for	them	,
they	're	not	just	 ly 	 ing 	 	around	on	the	surface	.
you	have	to	create	the	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	where	they	show	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
and	you	might	imagine	education	would	be	the	way	that	 happen 	 s 	 	,
but	too	often	it	's	not	.
every	education	system	in	the	world	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 reform 	 ed 	 	at	the	moment	and	it	's	not	 en 	 ough 	 	.
reform	is	no	use	 any 	 more 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	 simpl 	 y 	 	 improv 	 ing 	 	a	broken	model	.
what	we	need	--	and	the	word	's	 be 	 en 	 	used	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	course	of	the	past	few	 day 	 s 	 	--	is	not	evolution	,	but	a	revolution	in	education	.
 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 transform 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
one	of	the	real	 challeng 	 es 	 	is	to	 innov 	 ate 	 	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	in	education	.
 innov 	 ation 	 	is	hard	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 mean 	 s 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	people	do	n't	find	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	,	for	the	most	part	.
it	 mean 	 s 	 	 challeng 	 ing 	 	what	we	take	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	think	are	obvious	.
the	great	problem	for	reform	or	 transform 	 ation 	 	is	the	 tyrann 	 y 	 	of	common	sense	;	 thing 	 s 	 	that	people	think	,	``	well	,	it	ca	n't	be	 d 	 one 	 	any	other	way	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	the	way	it	's	 d 	 one 	 	.	``
i	came	 a 	 cross 	 	a	great	quote	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	from	abraham	lincoln	,	who	i	thought	you	'd	be	 pleas 	 ed 	 	to	have	 quote 	 d 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	december	1862	to	the	second	annual	 meet 	 ing 	 	of	congress	.
i	ought	to	explain	that	i	have	no	idea	what	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	at	the	time	.
we	do	n't	teach	american	 histo 	 ry 	 	in	britain	.
we	suppress	it	.	you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	our	policy	.
so	,	no	doubt	,	 some 	 thing 	 	 fasci 	 nating 	 	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	december	1862	,	which	the	americans	among	us	will	be	aware	of	.
but	he	 s 	 aid 	 	 th 	 is 	 	:	``	the	 dogma 	 s 	 	of	the	quiet	past	are	 in 	 ad 	 equate 	 	to	the	 storm 	 y 	 	present	.
the	occasion	is	 pil 	 ed 	 	high	with	 difficult 	 y 	 	,	and	we	must	rise	with	the	occasion	.	``
i	love	that	.
not	rise	to	it	,	rise	with	it	.
``	 a 	 s 	 	our	case	is	new	,	so	we	must	think	 a 	 new 	 	and	act	 a 	 new 	 	.	we	must	 dis 	 enthrall 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	and	then	we	 s 	 hall 	 	 s 	 ave 	 	our	country	.	``
i	love	that	word	,	``	 dis 	 enthrall 	 	.	``	you	know	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	?
that	there	are	 idea 	 s 	 	that	all	of	us	are	 enthrall 	 ed 	 	to	,	which	we	 simpl 	 y 	 	take	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	natural	order	of	 thing 	 s 	 	,	the	way	 thing 	 s 	 	are	.
and	 man 	 y 	 	of	our	 idea 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 form 	 ed 	 	,	not	to	meet	the	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	century	,	but	to	cope	with	the	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	of	previous	centuries	.
but	our	 mind 	 s 	 	are	still	 hypno 	 t 	 ized 	 	by	them	,
and	we	have	to	 dis 	 enthrall 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	of	some	of	them	.
now	,	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	 eas 	 ier 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	than	 d 	 one 	 	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	know	,	by	the	way	,	what	it	is	you	take	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	.
and	the	reason	is	that	you	take	it	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	.
so	let	me	ask	you	 some 	 thing 	 	you	may	take	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	here	are	over	the	age	of	25	?
that	's	not	what	i	think	you	take	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	,
i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	you	're	familiar	with	that	 al 	 ready 	 	.
are	there	any	people	here	under	the	age	of	25	?
great	.	now	,	 t 	 hose 	 	over	25	,	could	you	put	your	 hand 	 s 	 	up	if	you	're	 wear 	 ing 	 	your	 wrist 	 watch 	 	?
now	that	's	a	great	deal	of	us	,	is	n't	it	?
ask	a	room	full	of	 teenager 	 s 	 	the	same	thing	.
 teenager 	 s 	 	do	not	wear	 wrist 	 watch 	 es 	 	.
i	do	n't	mean	they	ca	n't	or	they	're	not	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	,	they	just	often	 choos 	 e 	 	not	to	.
and	the	reason	is	,	you	see	,	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	up	in	a	pre	-	digital	culture	,	 t 	 hose 	 	of	us	over	25	.
and	so	for	us	,	if	you	want	to	know	the	time	you	have	to	wear	 some 	 thing 	 	to	tell	it	.
 kid 	 s 	 	now	live	in	a	world	which	is	 digit 	 ized 	 	,	and	the	time	,	for	them	,	is	 every 	 where 	 	.
they	see	no	reason	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	by	the	way	,	you	do	n't	need	to	do	it	either	;	it	's	just	that	you	've	 al 	 ways 	 	 d 	 one 	 	it	and	you	carry	on	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
my	daughter	never	 wear 	 s 	 	a	watch	,	my	daughter	kate	,	who	's	20	.
she	 do 	 es 	 	n't	see	the	point	.
 a 	 s 	 	she	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	it	's	a	single	function	 de 	 vice 	 	.	``
``	like	,	how	 lam 	 e 	 	is	that	?	``
and	i	say	,	``	no	,	no	,	it	 tell 	 s 	 	the	date	 a 	 s 	 	well	.	``
``	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 multi 	 ple 	 	 function 	 s 	 	.	``
but	,	you	see	,	there	are	 thing 	 s 	 	we	're	 enthrall 	 ed 	 	to	in	education	.
let	me	give	you	a	couple	of	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
one	of	them	is	the	idea	of	 linear 	 ity 	 	:	that	it	 start 	 s 	 	here	and	you	go	through	a	track	and	if	you	do	 every 	 thing 	 	right	,	you	will	end	up	set	for	the	rest	of	your	life	.
 every 	 body 	 	who	's	spoken	at	ted	 ha 	 s 	 	told	us	 im 	 plicit 	 ly 	 	,	or	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 ex 	 plicit 	 ly 	 	,	a	different	story	:	that	life	is	not	linear	;	it	's	 organ 	 ic 	 	.
we	create	our	 live 	 s 	 	 sym 	 biotic 	 ally 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	explore	our	 talent 	 s 	 	in	relation	to	the	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	they	help	to	create	for	us	.	but	,	you	know	,	we	have	 be 	 come 	 	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	linear	narrative	.
and	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	pinnacle	for	education	is	 get 	 ting 	 	you	to	college	.
i	think	we	are	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	 get 	 ting 	 	people	to	college	.	certain	 sort 	 s 	 	of	college	.
i	do	n't	mean	you	should	n't	go	to	college	,	but	not	 every 	 body 	 	 need 	 s 	 	to	go	and	not	 every 	 body 	 	 need 	 s 	 	to	go	now	.
 may 	 be 	 	they	go	 lat 	 er 	 	,	not	right	away	.

and	at	the	heart	of	our	 challeng 	 es 	 	--	at	the	heart	of	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	is	to	 re 	 constitute 	 	our	sense	of	ability	and	of	 intellig 	 ence 	 	.

you	know	,	it	 work 	 ed 	 	out	for	eric	,	that	's	all	i	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	.
in	a	way	,	it	did	not	for	me	.
i	could	not	get	 th 	 is 	 	thing	to	work	no	matter	how	often	or	how	hard	i	 ble 	 w 	 	 in 	 to 	 	it	.
it	just	would	n't	work	.
but	it	's	not	 on 	 ly 	 	about	that	.
it	's	about	 pass 	 ion 	 	.
often	,	people	are	good	at	 thing 	 s 	 	they	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	care	for	.
it	's	about	 pass 	 ion 	 	,	and	what	 excit 	 es 	 	our	spirit	and	our	energy	.
and	if	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	the	thing	that	you	love	to	do	,	that	you	're	good	at	,	time	 take 	 s 	 	a	different	course	 entire 	 ly 	 	.
my	wife	's	just	 finish 	 ed 	 	writing	a	novel	,	and	i	think	it	's	a	great	book	,	but	she	 disappear 	 s 	 	for	 hour 	 s 	 	on	end	.
you	know	 th 	 is 	 	,	if	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	you	love	,	an	hour	 feel 	 s 	 	like	five	 minute 	 s 	 	.
if	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 reson 	 ate 	 	with	your	spirit	,	five	 minute 	 s 	 	 feel 	 s 	 	like	an	hour	.
and	the	reason	so	 man 	 y 	 	people	are	 opt 	 ing 	 	out	of	education	is	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	feed	 the 	 ir 	 	spirit	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	feed	 the 	 ir 	 	energy	or	 the 	 ir 	 	 pass 	 ion 	 	.
so	i	think	we	have	to	change	 metaphor 	 s 	 	.
we	have	to	go	from	what	is	 essential 	 ly 	 	an	industrial	model	of	education	,	a	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	model	,	which	is	based	on	 linear 	 ity 	 	and	 conform 	 ity 	 	and	 batch 	 ing 	 	people	.
we	have	to	move	to	a	model	that	is	based	more	on	 principle 	 s 	 	of	 agricultur 	 e 	 	.
we	have	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	that	human	 flourish 	 ing 	 	is	not	a	 mechanic 	 al 	 	process	;	it	's	an	 organ 	 ic 	 	process	.
and	you	can	not	predict	the	 out 	 come 	 	of	human	 develop 	 ment 	 	.	all	you	can	do	,	like	a	 farm 	 er 	 	,	is	create	the	 condition 	 s 	 	under	which	they	will	begin	to	flourish	.
so	when	we	look	at	 reform 	 ing 	 	education	and	 transform 	 ing 	 	it	,	it	is	n't	like	 clon 	 ing 	 	a	system	.
there	are	great	 one 	 s 	 	,	like	kipp	's	;	it	's	a	great	system	.
there	are	 man 	 y 	 	great	 model 	 s 	 	.
it	's	about	 custom 	 izing 	 	to	your	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	and	 personal 	 izing 	 	education	to	the	people	you	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 teach 	 ing 	 	.	and	 do 	 ing 	 	that	,	i	think	,	is	the	answer	to	the	future	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	not	about	 scal 	 ing 	 	a	new	solution	;	it	's	about	creating	a	 move 	 ment 	 	in	education	in	which	people	develop	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 solution 	 s 	 	,	but	with	external	support	based	on	a	 personal 	 ized 	 	curriculum	.
now	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	there	are	people	who	represent	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	in	business	,	in	 multi 	 media 	 	,	in	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
these	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	 combine 	 d 	 	with	the	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 talent 	 s 	 	of	 teacher 	 s 	 	,	provide	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	 revolution 	 ize 	 	education	.
and	i	urge	you	to	get	 involve 	 d 	 	in	it	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	vital	,	not	just	to	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	but	to	the	future	of	our	children	.
but	we	have	to	change	from	the	industrial	model	to	an	 agricultur 	 al 	 	model	,	where	each	school	can	be	 flourish 	 ing 	 	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	.
that	's	where	children	experience	life	.
or	at	home	,	if	that	's	where	they	 choos 	 e 	 	to	be	educated	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	or	 the 	 ir 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	.
there	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	lot	of	talk	about	 dream 	 s 	 	over	the	course	of	 th 	 is 	 	few	 day 	 s 	 	.
and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	just	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	...	i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 truck 	 	by	natalie	 merchan 	 t 	 	's	 song 	 s 	 	last	night	,	 re 	 cover 	 ing 	 	old	 poem 	 s 	 	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	read	you	a	quick	,	 ver 	 y 	 	short	poem	from	w.	b.	yeats	,	who	some	of	you	may	know	.
he	wrote	 th 	 is 	 	to	his	love	,	maud	gonne	,	and	he	was	 be 	 wail 	 ing 	 	the	fact	that	he	could	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	give	her	what	he	thought	she	 want 	 ed 	 	from	him	.	and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	've	got	 some 	 thing 	 	else	,	but	it	may	not	be	for	you	.	``
he	 say 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	:	``	had	i	the	 heaven 	 s 	 	'	 embr 	 oid 	 er 	 ed 	 	 cloth 	 s 	 	,	enwrought	with	gold	and	silver	light	,	the	blue	and	the	 d 	 im 	 	and	the	dark	 cloth 	 s 	 	of	night	and	light	and	the	half	-	light	,	i	would	spread	the	 cloth 	 s 	 	under	your	feet	:	but	i	,	 be 	 ing 	 	poor	,	have	 on 	 ly 	 	my	 dream 	 s 	 	;	i	have	spread	my	 dream 	 s 	 	under	your	feet	;	tread	 soft 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	you	tread	on	my	 dream 	 s 	 	.	``
and	every	day	,	 every 	 where 	 	,	our	children	spread	 the 	 ir 	 	 dream 	 s 	 	 be 	 neath 	 	our	feet	.
and	we	should	tread	 soft 	 ly 	 	.
thank	you	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
