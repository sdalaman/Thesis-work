i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	time	 travel 	 ing 	 	around	the	world	these	 day 	 s 	 	,	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	 group 	 s 	 	of	 student 	 s 	 	and	 professional 	 s 	 	,
and	 every 	 where 	 	i	'm	 find 	 ing 	 	that	i	hear	similar	 theme 	 s 	 	.
on	the	one	hand	,	people	say	,	``	the	time	for	change	is	now	.	``	they	want	to	be	part	of	it	.
they	talk	about	 want 	 ing 	 	 live 	 s 	 	of	purpose	and	 great 	 er 	 	meaning	.
but	on	the	other	hand	,	i	hear	people	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	fear	,	a	sense	of	risk	-	 a 	 version 	 	.
they	say	,	``	i	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	follow	a	life	of	purpose	,	but	i	do	n't	know	where	to	start	.
i	do	n't	want	to	disappoint	my	family	or	 friend 	 s 	 	.	``	i	work	in	global	poverty	.
and	they	say	,	``	i	want	to	work	in	global	poverty	,	but	what	will	it	mean	about	my	 care 	 er 	 	?
will	i	be	 marginal 	 ized 	 	?

and	 noth 	 ing 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	in	life	 with 	 out 	 	a	cost	.	``	these	 conversation 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	reflect	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	at	the	national	and	 inter 	 national 	 	level	.
our	 lead 	 ers 	 	and	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	want	 every 	 thing 	 	,	but	we	do	n't	talk	about	the	 cost 	 s 	 	.	we	do	n't	talk	about	the	sacrifice	.
one	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 quote 	 s 	 	from	 liter 	 ature 	 	was	written	by	tillie	olsen	,	the	great	american	writer	from	the	south	.
in	a	short	story	 call 	 ed 	 	``	oh	 y 	 es 	 	,	``	she	 talk 	 s 	 	about	a	white	woman	in	the	1950s	who	 ha 	 s 	 	a	daughter	who	befriends	a	little	african	american	girl	,

``	better	 immers 	 ion 	 	than	to	live	 un 	 touch 	 ed 	 	.	``	but	the	real	question	is	,	what	is	the	cost	of	not	 da 	 ring 	 	?

one	woman	i	 k 	 new 	 	who	was	a	fellow	at	a	program	that	i	ran	at	the	rockefeller	 found 	 ation 	 	was	named	ingrid	washinawatok	.
she	was	a	 lead 	 er 	 	of	the	menominee	tribe	,	a	native	american	 people 	 s 	 	.
and	when	we	would	gather	 a 	 s 	 	 fellow 	 s 	 	,	she	would	push	us	to	think	about	how	the	 elder 	 s 	 	in	native	american	culture	make	 decision 	 s 	 	.
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	they	would	 liter 	 ally 	 	 visual 	 ize 	 	the	 face 	 s 	 	of	children	for	seven	 generation 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	future	,	looking	at	them	from	the	earth	,
and	they	would	look	at	them	,	 hold 	 ing 	 	them	 a 	 s 	 	 steward 	 s 	 	for	that	future	.
ingrid	 under 	 stood 	 	that	we	are	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	each	other	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	but	to	every	living	thing	on	the	planet	.
and	 tragic 	 ally 	 	,	in	1999	,	when	she	was	in	colombia	 work 	 ing 	 	with	the	u'wa	people	,	focused	on	 pre 	 serv 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	culture	and	language	,	she	and	two	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 abduct 	 ed 	 	and	 torture 	 d 	 	and	 kill 	 ed 	 	by	the	farc	.
and	 when 	 ever 	 	we	would	gather	the	 fellow 	 s 	 	after	that	,	we	would	 leav 	 e 	 	a	chair	empty	for	her	spirit	.
and	more	than	a	decade	 lat 	 er 	 	,	when	i	talk	to	ngo	 fellow 	 s 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	in	trenton	,	new	jersey	or	the	 off 	 ice 	 	of	the	white	house	,	and	we	talk	about	ingrid	,	they	all	say	that	they	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	integrate	her	 wis 	 dom 	 	and	her	spirit	and	 re 	 ally 	 	build	on	the	 un 	 fulfill 	 ed 	 	work	of	her	life	's	mission	.
and	when	we	think	about	 leg 	 acy 	 	,	i	can	think	of	no	more	 power 	 ful 	 	one	,	 de 	 spite 	 	how	short	her	life	was	.
and	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 touch 	 ed 	 	by	cambodian	women	--	 beaut 	 iful 	 	women	,	women	who	held	the	tradition	of	the	 classic 	 al 	 	dance	in	cambodia	.
and	i	met	them	in	the	early	'90s	.
in	the	1970s	,	under	the	pol	pot	regime	,	the	khmer	rouge	 kill 	 ed 	 	over	a	million	people	,
and	they	focused	and	 target 	 ed 	 	the	 elite 	 s 	 	and	the	 intellectual 	 s 	 	,	the	 artist 	 s 	 	,	the	 danc 	 ers 	 	.
and	at	the	end	of	the	war	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	30	of	these	 classic 	 al 	 	 danc 	 ers 	 	still	living	.
and	the	women	,	who	i	was	so	 privilege 	 d 	 	to	meet	when	there	 we 	 re 	 	three	 surviv 	 ors 	 	,	told	these	 st 	 ories 	 	about	 ly 	 ing 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 co 	 ts 	 	in	the	 refuge 	 e 	 	 camp 	 s 	 	.	they	 s 	 aid 	 	they	would	try	so	hard	to	remember	the	 fragment 	 s 	 	of	the	dance	,	 hop 	 ing 	 	that	 other 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 ive 	 	and	 do 	 ing 	 	the	same	.
and	one	woman	stood	there	with	 th 	 is 	 	perfect	carriage	,	her	 hand 	 s 	 	at	her	side	,	and	she	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	the	 re 	 un 	 ion 	 	of	the	30	after	the	war	and	how	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	it	was	.
and	these	big	 tear 	 s 	 	fell	down	her	face	,	but	she	never	 lift 	 ed 	 	her	 hand 	 s 	 	to	move	them	.
and	the	women	 decide 	 d 	 	that	they	would	train	not	the	next	generation	of	 girl 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	had	grown	too	old	 al 	 ready 	 	,	but	the	next	generation	.
and	i	 s 	 at 	 	there	in	the	studio	 watch 	 ing 	 	these	women	 clap 	 ping 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	--	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 rhythm 	 s 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	these	little	 fair 	 y 	 	pixies	 we 	 re 	 	 danc 	 ing 	 	around	them	,	 wear 	 ing 	 	these	 beaut 	 iful 	 	silk	 color 	 s 	 	.
and	i	thought	,	after	all	 th 	 is 	 	atrocity	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	pray	.
 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	focused	on	 honor 	 ing 	 	what	is	most	 beaut 	 iful 	 	about	our	past	and	building	it	 in 	 to 	 	the	promise	of	our	future	.
and	what	these	women	 under 	 stood 	 	is	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	do	and	that	we	 s 	 pend 	 	our	time	on	are	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	can	not	measure	.
i	 al 	 so 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 touch 	 ed 	 	by	the	dark	side	of	power	and	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	.
and	i	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	power	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	absolute	form	,	is	an	equal	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	 provide 	 r 	 	.
in	1986	,	i	 move 	 d 	 	to	rwanda	,	and	i	 work 	 ed 	 	with	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	group	of	rwandan	women	to	start	that	country	's	first	 micro 	 finance 	 	bank	.
and	one	of	the	women	was	agnes	--	there	on	your	 extrem 	 e 	 	left	--	she	was	one	of	the	first	three	women	 parliament 	 arian 	 s 	 	in	rwanda	,	and	her	 leg 	 acy 	 	should	have	 be 	 en 	 	to	be	one	of	the	 mother 	 s 	 	of	rwanda	.
we	built	 th 	 is 	 	institution	based	on	social	justice	,	gender	 equ 	 ity 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	 empower 	 ing 	 	women	.
but	agnes	 car 	 ed 	 	more	about	the	 trapping 	 s 	 	of	power	than	she	did	principle	at	the	end	.
and	 th 	 ough 	 	she	had	 be 	 en 	 	part	of	building	a	liberal	party	,	a	 politic 	 al 	 	party	that	was	focused	on	 divers 	 ity 	 	and	 toler 	 ance 	 	,	about	three	 month 	 s 	 	before	the	genocide	,	she	 s 	 witch 	 ed 	 	 part 	 ies 	 	and	 join 	 ed 	 	the	 extrem 	 ist 	 	party	,	hutu	power	,	and	she	 be 	 came 	 	the	 mini 	 ster 	 	of	justice	under	the	genocide	regime	and	was	known	for	inciting	men	to	kill	 fast 	 er 	 	and	stop	 behav 	 ing 	 	like	women	.
she	was	 convict 	 ed 	 	of	 categor 	 y 	 	one	 crime 	 s 	 	of	genocide	.
and	i	would	visit	her	in	the	 pri 	 son 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	side	-	by	-	side	,	 knee 	 s 	 	 touch 	 ing 	 	,	and	i	would	have	to	admit	to	 my 	 self 	 	that	 mon 	 sters 	 	exist	in	all	of	us	,	but	that	 may 	 be 	 	it	's	not	 mon 	 sters 	 	so	much	,	but	the	broken	 part 	 s 	 	of	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	sadnesses	,	secret	shame	,	and	that	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	it	's	easy	for	demagogues	to	 pre 	 y 	 	on	 t 	 hose 	 	 part 	 s 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 fragment 	 s 	 	,	if	you	will	,	and	to	make	us	look	at	other	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 less 	 er 	 	than	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	--	and	in	the	 extrem 	 e 	 	,	to	do	 terr 	 ible 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	there	is	no	group	more	 vulner 	 able 	 	to	 t 	 hose 	 	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 manipul 	 ations 	 	than	young	men	.
i	've	heard	it	 s 	 aid 	 	that	the	most	 danger 	 ous 	 	animal	on	the	planet	is	the	adolescent	male	.
and	so	in	a	 gather 	 ing 	 	where	we	're	focused	on	women	,	while	it	is	so	critical	that	we	invest	in	our	 girl 	 s 	 	and	we	even	the	 play 	 ing 	 	field	and	we	find	ways	to	honor	them	,	we	have	to	remember	that	the	 girl 	 s 	 	and	the	women	are	most	 isolate 	 d 	 	and	 viol 	 ated 	 	and	victimized	and	made	 in 	 visible 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	where	our	men	and	our	 boy 	 s 	 	feel	disempowered	,	 un 	 able 	 	to	provide	.
and	that	,	when	they	 s 	 it 	 	on	 t 	 hose 	 	street	 corner 	 s 	 	and	all	they	can	think	of	in	the	future	is	no	job	,	no	education	,	no	 possibil 	 ity 	 	,	well	then	it	's	easy	to	understand	how	the	 great 	 est 	 	source	of	 stat 	 us 	 	can	come	from	a	uniform	and	a	gun	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	small	 invest 	 ments 	 	can	 re 	 lease 	 	enormous	,	infinite	potential	that	 exist 	 s 	 	in	all	of	us	.
one	of	the	acumen	fund	 fellow 	 s 	 	at	my	 organ 	 ization 	 	,	suraj	sudhakar	,	 ha 	 s 	 	what	we	call	moral	 imagin 	 ation 	 	--	the	ability	to	put	 your 	 self 	 	in	 an 	 other 	 	person	's	 shoe 	 s 	 	and	lead	from	that	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	.
and	he	's	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	young	group	of	men	who	come	from	the	largest	 s 	 lum 	 	in	the	world	,	kibera	.
and	they	're	 in 	 credible 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	.
and	together	they	 start 	 ed 	 	a	book	club	for	a	hundred	people	in	the	 s 	 lum 	 s 	 	,	and	they	're	 read 	 ing 	 	 man 	 y 	 	ted	 author 	 s 	 	and	 lik 	 ing 	 	it	.
and	then	they	 create 	 d 	 	a	business	plan	 com 	 petition 	 	.
then	they	 decide 	 d 	 	that	they	would	do	 ted 	 x 	 	's	.
and	i	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	so	much	from	chris	and	kevin	and	alex	and	herbert	and	all	of	these	young	men	.
alex	,	in	some	ways	,	 s 	 aid 	 	it	best	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	used	to	feel	like	 no 	 bodies 	 	,	but	now	we	feel	like	somebodies	.	``	and	i	think	we	have	it	all	wrong	when	we	think	that	income	is	the	link	.
what	we	 re 	 ally 	 	 year 	 n 	 	for	 a 	 s 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	is	to	be	visible	to	each	other	.
and	the	reason	these	young	 guy 	 s 	 	told	me	that	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	these	 ted 	 x 	 	's	is	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	sick	and	 tire 	 d 	 	of	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 work 	 shop 	 s 	 	coming	to	the	 s 	 lum 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 work 	 shop 	 s 	 	focused	on	hiv	,	or	at	best	,	 micro 	 finance 	 	.
and	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 celebr 	 ate 	 	what	's	 beaut 	 iful 	 	about	kibera	and	mathare	--	the	 photo 	 journalist 	 s 	 	and	the	 creative 	 s 	 	,	the	graffiti	 artist 	 s 	 	,	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	and	the	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	.
and	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
and	my	hat	's	off	to	you	in	kibera	.
my	own	work	 focus 	 es 	 	on	making	 philanthro 	 py 	 	more	effective	and	 capital 	 ism 	 	more	inclusive	.
at	acumen	fund	,	we	take	 philanthro 	 pic 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	and	we	invest	what	we	call	patient	capital	--	money	that	will	invest	in	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	who	see	the	poor	not	 a 	 s 	 	 pass 	 ive 	 	 recipient 	 s 	 	of	 char 	 ity 	 	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	full	-	bodied	 agent 	 s 	 	of	change	who	want	to	solve	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 problem 	 s 	 	and	make	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 decision 	 s 	 	.
we	 leav 	 e 	 	our	money	for	10	to	15	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	when	we	get	it	back	,	we	invest	in	other	 innov 	 ations 	 	that	focus	on	change	.
i	know	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
we	've	 invest 	 ed 	 	more	than	50	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	50	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	,
and	 t 	 hose 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	have	 br 	 ought 	 	 an 	 other 	 	200	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	these	 for 	 gotten 	 	 market 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	year	 al 	 one 	 	,	they	've	 deliver 	 ed 	 	40	million	 service 	 s 	 	like	 ma 	 ternal 	 	health	care	and	housing	,	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	 service 	 s 	 	,	solar	energy	,	so	that	people	can	have	more	dignity	in	solving	 the 	 ir 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	.
patient	capital	is	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	for	people	 search 	 ing 	 	for	simple	 solution 	 s 	 	,	easy	 categor 	 ies 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	do	n't	see	profit	 a 	 s 	 	a	blunt	instrument	.
but	we	find	 t 	 hose 	 	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	who	put	people	and	the	planet	before	profit	.
and	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	we	want	to	be	part	of	a	 move 	 ment 	 	that	is	about	 measur 	 ing 	 	impact	,	 measur 	 ing 	 	what	is	most	 import 	 ant 	 	to	us	.
and	my	dream	is	we	'll	have	a	world	one	day	where	we	do	n't	just	honor	 t 	 hose 	 	who	take	money	and	make	more	money	from	it	,	but	we	find	 t 	 hose 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	who	take	our	 resource 	 s 	 	and	convert	it	 in 	 to 	 	changing	the	world	in	the	most	positive	ways	.
and	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	when	we	honor	them	and	 celebr 	 ate 	 	them	and	give	them	 stat 	 us 	 	that	the	world	will	 re 	 ally 	 	change	.
last	may	i	had	 th 	 is 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	24	-	hour	period	where	i	saw	two	 vision 	 s 	 	of	the	world	living	side	-	by	-	side	--	one	based	on	violence	and	the	other	on	 transcend 	 ence 	 	.
i	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	be	in	lahore	,	pakistan	on	the	day	that	two	 mosque 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 attack 	 ed 	 	by	 su 	 icide 	 	 bomb 	 ers 	 	.
and	the	reason	these	 mosque 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 attack 	 ed 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	the	people	 pray 	 ing 	 	 in 	 side 	 	 we 	 re 	 	from	a	 part 	 icular 	 	sect	of	islam	who	 fundamental 	 ists 	 	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	are	fully	muslim	.
and	not	 on 	 ly 	 	did	 t 	 hose 	 	 su 	 icide 	 	 bomb 	 ers 	 	take	a	hundred	 live 	 s 	 	,	but	they	did	more	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 create 	 d 	 	more	hatred	,	more	rage	,	more	fear	and	 certain 	 ly 	 	despair	.
but	less	than	24	 hour 	 s 	 	,	i	was	13	 mile 	 s 	 	away	from	 t 	 hose 	 	 mosque 	 s 	 	,	 visit 	 ing 	 	one	of	our	acumen	investees	,	an	 in 	 credible 	 	man	,	jawad	aslam	,	who	 da 	 re 	 s 	 	to	live	a	life	of	 immers 	 ion 	 	.
born	and	raised	in	baltimore	,	he	 stud 	 ied 	 	real	 e 	 state 	 	,	 work 	 ed 	 	in	commercial	real	 e 	 state 	 	,	and	after	9/11	 decide 	 d 	 	he	was	going	to	pakistan	to	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
for	two	 year 	 s 	 	,	he	 hard 	 ly 	 	made	any	money	,	a	 tin 	 y 	 	stipend	,	but	he	 apprentice 	 d 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	housing	 develop 	 er 	 	named	tasneem	saddiqui	.
and	he	had	a	dream	that	he	would	build	a	housing	community	on	 th 	 is 	 	 bar 	 ren 	 	piece	of	land	using	patient	capital	,	but	he	 continu 	 ed 	 	to	pay	a	price	.
he	stood	on	moral	ground	and	 re 	 fused 	 	to	pay	 bribe 	 s 	 	.
it	took	 al 	 most 	 	two	 year 	 s 	 	just	to	register	the	land	.
but	i	saw	how	the	level	of	moral	standard	can	rise	from	one	person	's	action	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	2,000	people	live	in	300	 house 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	community	.
and	there	's	 school 	 s 	 	and	 clinic 	 s 	 	and	 shop 	 s 	 	.
but	there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	one	mosque	.
and	so	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	jawad	,	``	how	do	you	 guy 	 s 	 	 navig 	 ate 	 	?	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 divers 	 e 	 	community	.

it	was	hard	,	it	was	a	difficult	road	,	but	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	the	 lead 	 ers 	 	of	the	community	came	together	,	 real 	 izing 	 	we	 on 	 ly 	 	have	each	other	.
and	we	 decide 	 d 	 	that	we	would	elect	the	three	most	 respect 	 ed 	 	 imam 	 s 	 	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	 imam 	 s 	 	would	take	 turn 	 s 	 	,	they	would	 rot 	 ate 	 	who	would	say	friday	 pray 	 er 	 	.
but	the	whole	community	,	all	the	different	sects	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	shi'a	and	sunni	,	would	 s 	 it 	 	together	and	pray	.	``	we	need	that	kind	of	moral	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	and	courage	in	our	 world 	 s 	 	.

and	every	day	we	have	a	choice	.
we	can	take	the	 eas 	 ier 	 	road	,	the	more	 cynic 	 al 	 	road	,	which	is	a	road	based	on	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 dream 	 s 	 	of	a	past	that	never	 re 	 ally 	 	was	,	a	fear	of	each	other	,	 d 	 istan 	 c 	 ing 	 	and	blame	.	or	we	can	take	the	much	more	difficult	path	of	 transform 	 ation 	 	,	 transcend 	 ence 	 	,	 compass 	 ion 	 	and	love	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 account 	 ability 	 	and	justice	.
i	had	the	great	honor	of	 work 	 ing 	 	with	the	child	 psycho 	 logist 	 	dr.	robert	coles	,	who	stood	up	for	change	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	civil	 right 	 s 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
and	he	 tell 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	story	about	 work 	 ing 	 	with	a	little	six	-	year	-	old	girl	named	ruby	 bridge 	 s 	 	,	the	first	child	to	desegregate	 school 	 s 	 	in	the	south	--	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	new	orleans	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	that	every	day	 th 	 is 	 	six	-	year	-	old	,	 dress 	 ed 	 	in	her	 beaut 	 iful 	 	dress	,	would	walk	with	real	grace	through	a	 phal 	 anx 	 	of	white	people	 s 	 cream 	 ing 	 	angrily	,	 call 	 ing 	 	her	a	 mon 	 ster 	 	,	 threaten 	 ing 	 	to	poison	her	--	 distort 	 ed 	 	 face 	 s 	 	.
and	every	day	he	would	watch	her	,	and	it	 look 	 ed 	 	like	she	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	the	people	.
and	he	would	say	,	``	ruby	,	what	are	you	 say 	 ing 	 	?	``	and	she	'd	say	,	``	i	'm	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	.	``	and	 final 	 ly 	 	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	ruby	,	i	see	that	you	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	.
what	are	you	 say 	 ing 	 	?	``	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	dr.	coles	,	i	am	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	;	i	'm	 pray 	 ing 	 	.	``	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	what	are	you	 pray 	 ing 	 	?	``	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'm	 pray 	 ing 	 	,	'	father	,	forgive	them	,	for	they	know	not	what	they	are	 do 	 ing 	 	.	'	``	at	age	six	,	 th 	 is 	 	child	was	living	a	life	of	 immers 	 ion 	 	,	and	her	family	paid	a	price	for	it	.

my	final	story	is	about	a	young	,	 beaut 	 iful 	 	man	named	josephat	byaruhanga	,	who	was	 an 	 other 	 	acumen	fund	fellow	,	who	hails	from	uganda	,	a	 farm 	 ing 	 	community	.
and	we	 place 	 d 	 	him	in	a	company	in	western	kenya	,	just	200	 mile 	 s 	 	away	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	at	the	end	of	his	year	,	``	jacqueline	,	it	was	so	 hum 	 bling 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	thought	 a 	 s 	 	a	 farm 	 er 	 	and	 a 	 s 	 	an	african	i	would	understand	how	to	transcend	culture	.

and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	but	right	before	the	harvest	,	it	 bend 	 s 	 	over	with	great	 grat 	 itude 	 	and	 humil 	 ity 	 	to	touch	the	earth	from	where	it	came	.	``	we	need	 lead 	 ers 	 	.

robert	kennedy	once	 s 	 aid 	 	that	``	few	of	us	have	the	 great 	 ness 	 	to	bend	 histo 	 ry 	 	 it 	 self 	 	,	but	each	of	us	can	work	to	change	a	small	 port 	 ion 	 	of	 event 	 s 	 	.	``
