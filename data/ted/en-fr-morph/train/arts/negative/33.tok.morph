i	get	 ask 	 ed 	 	a	lot	what	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	my	work	is	and	typical	 pent 	 agon 	 	long	-	range	 strat 	 egic 	 	 plan 	 ner 	 s 	 	.
and	the	answer	i	like	to	 off 	 er 	 	is	what	they	 typical 	 ly 	 	do	is	they	think	about	the	future	of	 war 	 s 	 	in	the	 con 	 text 	 	of	war	.
and	what	i	've	 s 	 pent 	 	15	 year 	 s 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	business	--	and	it	's	taken	me	 al 	 most 	 	14	to	figure	it	out	--	is	i	think	about	the	future	of	 war 	 s 	 	in	the	 con 	 text 	 	of	 every 	 thing 	 	else	.
so	i	tend	to	 special 	 ize 	 	on	the	scene	between	war	and	peace	.
the	material	i	'm	going	to	show	you	is	one	idea	from	a	book
with	a	lot	of	 idea 	 s 	 	.
it	's	the	one	that	 take 	 s 	 	me	around	the	world	right	now	 interact 	 ing 	 	with	foreign	 militar 	 ies 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	a	bit	.
the	material	was	generated	in	two	 year 	 s 	 	of	work	i	did	for	the	 secret 	 ary 	 	of	defense	,	 think 	 ing 	 	about	a	new	national	grand	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	for	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	present	a	problem	and	try	to	give	you	an	answer	.
here	's	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	bonehead	 con 	 cept 	 	from	the	1990s	in	the	 pent 	 agon 	 	:	the	 theor 	 y 	 	of	anti	-	access	,	area	-	 deni 	 al 	 	 a 	 symmetric 	 al 	 	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	.
why	do	we	call	it	that	?
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	got	all	 t 	 hose 	 	a	's	lined	up	i	guess	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 go 	 bble 	 dy 	 go 	 ok 	 	for	if	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 fight 	 s 	 	 some 	 body 	 	we	're	going	to	be	huge	.	they	're	going	to	be	small	.
and	if	they	try	to	fight	us	in	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	,	straight	-	up	manner	we	're	going	to	kick	 the 	 ir 	 	ass	,	which	is	why	people	do	n't	try	to	do	that	any	more	.
i	met	the	last	air	force	general	who	had	 actual 	 ly 	 	shot	down	an	 ene 	 my 	 	plane	in	combat	.
he	's	now	a	one	star	general	.
that	's	how	 di 	 stant 	 	we	are	from	even	 meet 	 ing 	 	an	air	force	 will 	 ing 	 	to	fly	against	 our 	 s 	 	.
so	that	overmatched	 cap 	 ability 	 	 create 	 s 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	--	 catastroph 	 ic 	 	 success 	 es 	 	the	white	house	 call 	 s 	 	them	.
and	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	that	out	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 cap 	 ability 	 	.
the	question	is	,	what	's	the	good	you	can	do	with	it	?
ok	?
the	 theor 	 y 	 	of	anti	-	access	,	area	-	 deni 	 al 	 	 a 	 symmetric 	 al 	 	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	--	 go 	 bble 	 dy 	 go 	 ok 	 	that	we	sell	to	congress	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	we	just	told	them	we	can	kick	 any 	 body 	 	's	 ass 	 es 	 	they	would	n't	buy	us	all	the	stuff	we	want	.
so	we	say	,	area	-	 deni 	 al 	 	,	anti	-	access	 a 	 symmetric 	 al 	 	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	 glaz 	 e 	 	over	.
and	they	say	,	``	will	you	build	it	in	my	 di 	 strict 	 	?	``
here	's	my	 paro 	 dy 	 	and	it	ai	n't	much	of	one	.
let	's	talk	about	a	battle	space	.	i	do	n't	know	,	taiwan	 s 	 trait 	 s 	 	2025	.
let	's	talk	about	an	 ene 	 my 	 	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	 with 	 in 	 	that	battle	space	.
i	do	n't	know	,	the	million	man	swim	.
the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	access	that	battle	space	 instantaneous 	 ly 	 	.
they	throw	up	anti	-	access	,	area	-	 deni 	 al 	 	 a 	 symmetric 	 al 	 	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	.
a	banana	peel	on	the	 tar 	 mac 	 	.
trojan	 horse 	 s 	 	on	our	computer	 network 	 s 	 	reveal	all	our	 a 	 chill 	 es 	 	'	 heel 	 s 	 	 instant 	 ly 	 	.
we	say	,	``	 chin 	 a 	 	,	it	's	 your 	 s 	 	.	``
prometheus	approach	,	 large 	 ly 	 	a	 geo 	 graphic 	 	definition	,	 focus 	 es 	 	 al 	 most 	 	 exclusive 	 ly 	 	on	the	start	of	conflict	.
we	field	the	first	-	half	team	in	a	league	that	 insist 	 s 	 	on	 keep 	 ing 	 	score	 un 	 til 	 	the	end	of	the	game	.
that	's	the	problem	.
we	can	run	the	score	up	against	 any 	 body 	 	,	and	then	get	our	 ass 	 es 	 	 kick 	 ed 	 	in	the	second	half	--	what	they	call	fourth	generation	 war 	 fare 	 	.
here	's	the	way	i	like	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	it	 in 	 stead 	 	.
there	is	no	battle	space	the	u.s.	 militar 	 y 	 	can	not	access	.
they	 s 	 aid 	 	we	could	n't	do	afghanistan	.	we	did	it	with	ease	.
they	 s 	 aid 	 	we	could	n't	do	 ir 	 aq 	 	.
we	did	it	with	150	combat	 casual 	 ties 	 	in	six	 week 	 s 	 	.
we	did	it	so	fast	we	 we 	 re 	 	n't	prepared	for	 the 	 ir 	 	collapse	.
there	is	 no 	 body 	 	we	ca	n't	take	down	.
the	question	is	,	what	do	you	do	with	the	power	?
so	there	's	no	trouble	 access 	 ing 	 	battle	 space 	 s 	 	.
what	we	have	trouble	 access 	 ing 	 	is	the	 transit 	 ion 	 	space	that	must	 natural 	 ly 	 	follow	,	and	creating	the	peace	space	that	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	move	on	.
problem	is	,	the	defense	 depart 	 ment 	 	over	here	 beat 	 s 	 	the	hell	out	of	you	.
the	state	 depart 	 ment 	 	over	here	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	come	on	boy	,	i	know	you	can	make	it	.	``	and	that	poor	country	 run 	 s 	 	off	that	ledge	,	 do 	 es 	 	that	cartoon	thing	and	then	 drop 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	about	 overwhelm 	 ing 	 	force	,	but	 proportion 	 al 	 	force	.
it	's	about	non	-	lethal	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	fire	real	ammo	 in 	 to 	 	a	crowd	of	women	and	children	 riot 	 ing 	 	you	're	going	to	lose	 friend 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	about	 project 	 ing 	 	power	,	but	about	 stay 	 ing 	 	power	,	which	is	about	 leg 	 i 	 timacy 	 	with	the	 local 	 s 	 	.
who	do	you	access	in	 th 	 is 	 	 transit 	 ion 	 	space	?
you	have	to	create	internal	 partner 	 s 	 	.	you	have	to	access	 coal 	 ition 	 	 partner 	 s 	 	.
we	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	 in 	 d 	 ians 	 	for	17,000	peace	 keeper 	 s 	 	.
i	know	 the 	 ir 	 	senior	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	,	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	give	it	to	us	.
but	they	 s 	 aid 	 	to	us	,	``	you	know	what	?
in	that	 transit 	 ion 	 	space	you	're	 most 	 ly 	 	hat	not	 en 	 ough 	 	cattle	.
we	do	n't	think	you	can	pull	it	off	,	we	're	not	going	to	give	you	our	17,000	peace	 keeper 	 s 	 	for	 f 	 odd 	 er 	 	.	``
we	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	russians	for	40,000	.
they	 s 	 aid 	 	no	.
i	was	in	 chin 	 a 	 	in	august	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	should	have	50,000	peace	 keeper 	 s 	 	in	 ir 	 aq 	 	.	it	's	your	oil	,	not	 our 	 s 	 	.	``	which	is	the	truth	.	it	's	 the 	 ir 	 	oil	.
and	the	chinese	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	``	dr.	barnett	,	you	're	 absolute 	 ly 	 	right	.
in	a	perfect	world	we	'd	have	50,000	there	.
but	it	's	not	a	perfect	world	,	and	your	 administr 	 ation 	 	is	n't	 get 	 ting 	 	us	any	 close 	 r 	 	.	``	but	we	have	trouble	 access 	 ing 	 	our	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	.
we	lucked	out	,	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	on	the	 s 	 election 	 	.
we	face	different	 opponent 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	these	three	.
and	it	's	time	to	start	 admit 	 ting 	 	you	ca	n't	ask	the	same	19	-	year	-	old	to	do	it	all	,	day	in	and	day	out	.
it	's	just	too	damn	hard	.
we	have	an	 un 	 parallel 	 ed 	 	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	wage	war	.
we	do	n't	do	the	 every 	 thing 	 	else	so	well	.
 frank 	 ly 	 	,	we	do	it	better	than	 any 	 body 	 	and	we	still	suck	at	it	.
we	have	a	 brilli 	 ant 	 	 secret 	 ary 	 	of	war	.
we	do	n't	have	a	 secret 	 ary 	 	of	 every 	 thing 	 	else	.
 be 	 cause 	 	if	we	did	,	that	guy	would	be	in	front	of	the	senate	,	still	 test 	 ifying 	 	over	abu	ghraib	.
the	problem	is	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	exist	.
there	is	no	 secret 	 ary 	 	of	 every 	 thing 	 	else	.
i	think	we	have	an	 un 	 parallel 	 ed 	 	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	wage	war	.
i	call	that	the	 le 	 via 	 than 	 	force	.
what	we	need	to	build	is	a	force	for	the	 every 	 thing 	 	else	.	i	call	them	the	system	 administr 	 ators 	 	.
what	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 represent 	 s 	 	is	lack	of	an	a	to	z	rule	set	for	the	world	 a 	 s 	 	a	whole	for	 process 	 ing 	 	 politic 	 ally 	 	bankrupt	 state 	 s 	 	.
we	have	one	for	 process 	 ing 	 	 economic 	 ally 	 	bankrupt	 state 	 s 	 	.
it	's	the	imf	sovereign	 bankrupt 	 cy 	 	plan	,	ok	?
we	 argu 	 e 	 	about	it	every	time	we	use	it	.
argentina	just	went	through	it	,	broke	a	lot	of	 rule 	 s 	 	.
they	got	out	on	the	far	end	,	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	fine	,	do	n't	worry	about	it	.	``
it	's	 trans 	 parent 	 	.	a	certain	amount	of	 certain 	 ty 	 	 give 	 s 	 	the	sense	of	a	non	-	zero	 out 	 come 	 	.
we	do	n't	have	one	for	 process 	 ing 	 	 politic 	 ally 	 	bankrupt	 state 	 s 	 	that	,	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	 every 	 body 	 	 want 	 s 	 	gone	.
like	saddam	,	like	mugabe	,	like	kim	jong	-	il	--	people	who	kill	in	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	or	 million 	 s 	 	.
like	the	250,000	dead	so	far	in	sudan	.
what	would	an	a	to	z	system	look	like	?
i	'm	going	to	distinguish	between	what	i	call	front	half	and	back	half	.
and	let	's	call	 th 	 is 	 	red	line	,	i	do	n't	know	,	mission	 accomplish 	 ed 	 	.
what	we	have	extant	right	now	,	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	system	,	is	the	u.n.	security	council	 a 	 s 	 	a	grand	jury	.
what	can	they	do	?
they	can	indict	your	ass	.
they	can	debate	it	.	they	can	write	it	on	a	piece	of	paper	.	they	can	put	it	in	an	 envelop 	 e 	 	and	mail	it	to	you	,
and	then	say	in	no	 un 	 certain 	 	 term 	 s 	 	,	``	 pleas 	 e 	 	cut	that	out	.	``
that	 get 	 s 	 	you	about	four	million	dead	in	central	africa	over	the	1990s	.
that	 get 	 s 	 	you	250,000	dead	in	the	sudan	in	the	last	15	 month 	 s 	 	.
 every 	 body 	 	's	got	to	answer	 the 	 ir 	 	 grand 	 children 	 	some	day	what	you	did	about	the	 holo 	 caus 	 t 	 	in	africa	,
and	you	better	have	an	answer	.
we	do	n't	have	 any 	 thing 	 	to	 transl 	 ate 	 	that	will	 in 	 to 	 	action	.
what	we	do	have	is	the	u.s.	-	enabled	 le 	 via 	 than 	 	force	that	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	you	want	me	to	take	that	guy	down	?	i	'll	take	that	guy	down	.

they	love	to	put	them	on	trial	.	they	've	got	milosevic	right	now	.
what	are	we	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	?
a	 function 	 ing 	 	 ex 	 ecutive 	 	that	will	 transl 	 ate 	 	will	 in 	 to 	 	action	,
 be 	 cause 	 	we	do	n't	have	it	.	every	time	we	lead	one	of	these	 effort 	 s 	 	we	have	to	whip	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 im 	 min 	 ent 	 	threat	thing	.
we	have	n't	 face 	 d 	 	an	 im 	 min 	 ent 	 	threat	since	the	cuban	 mis 	 s 	 ile 	 	crisis	in	1962	.
but	we	use	 th 	 is 	 	language	from	a	 by 	 gone 	 	era	to	 s 	 care 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	a	 demo 	 cracy 	 	and	that	's	what	it	 take 	 s 	 	.
and	if	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	we	 s 	 cream 	 	,	``	he	's	got	a	gun	!	``	just	 a 	 s 	 	we	rush	in	.
and	then	we	look	over	the	body	and	we	find	an	old	 cigar 	 ette 	 	 light 	 er 	 	and	we	say	,	``	jesus	,	it	was	dark	.	``	do	you	want	to	do	it	,	france	?

here	's	my	 challeng 	 e 	 	to	the	defense	 depart 	 ment 	 	.
you	've	got	to	build	 th 	 is 	 	force	.	you	've	got	to	seed	 th 	 is 	 	force	.	you	've	got	to	track	 coal 	 ition 	 	 partner 	 s 	 	.	create	a	record	of	success	.
you	will	get	 th 	 is 	 	model	.
you	tell	me	it	's	too	hard	to	do	.
i	'll	walk	 th 	 is 	 	dog	right	through	that	six	part	 s 	 eries 	 	on	the	balkans	.
we	did	it	just	like	that	.
i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	regularizing	it	,	making	it	 trans 	 parent 	 	.
would	you	like	mugabe	gone	?
would	you	like	kim	jong	-	il	,	who	's	 kill 	 ed 	 	about	two	million	people	,	would	you	like	him	gone	?
would	you	like	a	better	system	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	why	it	 matter 	 s 	 	to	the	 militar 	 y 	 	.
they	've	 be 	 en 	 	 ex 	 peri 	 encing 	 	an	 ident 	 ity 	 	crisis	since	the	end	of	the	cold	war	.
i	'm	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	 re 	 ality 	 	and	 desir 	 e 	 	,	which	i	can	do	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	not	 in 	 side 	 	the	beltway	.

so	they	start	moving	from	 re 	 ality 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 desir 	 e 	 	and	they	create	 the 	 ir 	 	own	special	language	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	voyage	of	self	-	 discover 	 y 	 	and	self	-	actualization	.
the	problem	is	you	need	a	big	,	sexy	opponent	to	fight	against	.

some	people	put	these	two	 thing 	 s 	 	together	and	they	call	it	empire	,	which	i	think	is	a	boneheaded	 con 	 cept 	 	.
