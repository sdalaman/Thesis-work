i	want	you	to	imagine	two	 couple 	 s 	 	in	the	middle	of	1979	on	the	exact	same	day	,	at	the	exact	same	moment	,	each	 conceiv 	 ing 	 	a	baby	--	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
so	two	 couple 	 s 	 	each	 conceiv 	 ing 	 	one	baby	.
now	i	do	n't	want	you	to	 s 	 pend 	 	too	much	time	 imagin 	 ing 	 	the	conception	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	 s 	 pend 	 	all	that	time	 imagin 	 ing 	 	that	conception	,	you	're	not	going	to	listen	to	me	.
so	just	imagine	that	for	a	moment	.
and	in	 th 	 is 	 	scenario	,	i	want	to	imagine	that	,	in	one	case	,	the	 s 	 perm 	 	is	 carry 	 ing 	 	a	y	 chromosom 	 e 	 	,	 meet 	 ing 	 	that	x	 chromosom 	 e 	 	of	the	egg	.
and	in	the	other	case	,	the	 s 	 perm 	 	is	 carry 	 ing 	 	an	x	 chromosom 	 e 	 	,	 meet 	 ing 	 	the	x	 chromosom 	 e 	 	of	the	egg	.
both	are	 vi 	 able 	 	;	both	take	off	.
we	'll	come	back	to	these	people	 lat 	 er 	 	.
so	i	wear	two	 hat 	 s 	 	in	most	of	what	i	do	.
 a 	 s 	 	the	one	hat	,	i	do	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	anatomy	.
i	'm	a	historian	by	training	,	and	what	i	 stud 	 y 	 	in	that	case	is	the	way	that	people	have	 deal 	 t 	 	with	anatomy	--	meaning	human	bodies	,	animal	bodies	--	how	they	 deal 	 t 	 	with	 bod 	 ily 	 	 fluid 	 s 	 	,	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	of	bodies	;	how	have	they	thought	about	bodies	.
the	other	hat	that	i	've	worn	in	my	work	is	 a 	 s 	 	an	activist	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	patient	 advoc 	 ate 	 	--	or	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	say	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	 im 	 patient 	 	 advoc 	 ate 	 	--	for	people	who	are	 patient 	 s 	 	of	 doctor 	 s 	 	.
in	that	case	,	what	i	've	 work 	 ed 	 	with	is	people	who	have	body	 type 	 s 	 	that	 challeng 	 e 	 	social	 norm 	 s 	 	.
so	some	of	what	i	've	 work 	 ed 	 	on	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	is	people	who	are	 con 	 join 	 ed 	 	 t 	 win 	 s 	 	--	two	people	 with 	 in 	 	one	body	.
some	of	what	i	've	 work 	 ed 	 	on	is	people	who	have	dwarfism	--	so	people	who	are	much	 short 	 er 	 	than	typical	.
and	a	lot	of	what	i	've	 work 	 ed 	 	on	is	people	who	have	 a 	 typical 	 	 s 	 ex 	 	--	so	people	who	do	n't	have	the	standard	male	or	the	standard	female	body	 type 	 s 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	a	general	term	,	we	can	use	the	term	intersex	for	 th 	 is 	 	.
intersex	 come 	 s 	 	in	a	lot	of	different	 form 	 s 	 	.
i	'll	just	give	you	a	few	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	the	 type 	 s 	 	of	ways	you	can	have	 s 	 ex 	 	that	is	n't	standard	for	male	or	female	.
so	in	one	 in 	 stance 	 	,	you	can	have	 some 	 body 	 	who	 ha 	 s 	 	an	xy	chromosomal	 bas 	 is 	 	,	and	that	_UNK_	gene	on	the	y	 chromosom 	 e 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	the	proto	-	 gon 	 ad 	 s 	 	,	which	we	all	have	in	the	 fet 	 al 	 	life	,	to	 be 	 come 	 	 test 	 es 	 	.
and	so	in	the	 fet 	 al 	 	life	the	 test 	 es 	 	are	 pump 	 ing 	 	out	testosterone	.
but	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	individual	 lack 	 s 	 	 receptor 	 s 	 	to	hear	that	testosterone	,	the	body	 do 	 es 	 	n't	react	to	the	testosterone	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	syndrome	 call 	 ed 	 	androgen	insensitivity	syndrome	.
so	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 level 	 s 	 	of	testosterone	,	but	no	 re 	 action 	 	to	it	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	 con 	 sequence 	 	,	the	body	 develop 	 s 	 	more	 a 	 long 	 	the	female	typical	path	.
when	the	child	is	born	,	she	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	girl	.
she	is	a	girl	.	she	is	raised	 a 	 s 	 	a	girl	.
and	it	's	often	not	 un 	 til 	 	she	 hit 	 s 	 	puberty	and	she	's	growing	and	 develop 	 ing 	 	 breast 	 s 	 	,	but	she	's	not	 get 	 ting 	 	her	period	,	that	 some 	 body 	 	 figure 	 s 	 	out	 some 	 thing 	 	's	up	here	.
and	they	do	some	 test 	 s 	 	and	figure	out	that	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	 ov 	 aries 	 	 in 	 side 	 	and	a	uterus	,	she	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 test 	 es 	 	 in 	 side 	 	,	and	she	 ha 	 s 	 	a	y	 chromosom 	 e 	 	.
now	what	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	understand	is	you	may	think	of	 th 	 is 	 	person	 a 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	male	,	but	they	're	 re 	 ally 	 	not	.
 female 	 s 	 	,	like	 male 	 s 	 	,	have	in	our	bodies	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	adrenal	 g 	 land 	 s 	 	.
they	're	in	the	back	of	our	body	.
and	the	adrenal	 g 	 land 	 s 	 	make	androgens	,	which	are	a	_UNK_	hormone	.
most	 female 	 s 	 	like	me	--	i	 believ 	 e 	 	 my 	 self 	 	to	be	a	typical	female	--	i	do	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	know	my	chromosomal	make	-	up	but	i	think	i	'm	 prob 	 ably 	 	typical	--	most	 female 	 s 	 	like	me	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	androgen	-	sensitive	.
we	're	making	androgen	,	and	we	're	 respond 	 ing 	 	to	androgens	.
the	 con 	 sequence 	 	is	that	 some 	 body 	 	like	me	 ha 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	a	brain	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	to	more	androgens	than	the	woman	born	with	 test 	 es 	 	who	 ha 	 s 	 	androgen	insensitivity	syndrome	.
so	 s 	 ex 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	;	it	's	not	just	that	intersex	people	are	in	the	middle	of	all	the	 s 	 ex 	 	spectrum	--	in	some	ways	,	they	can	be	all	over	the	place	.
 an 	 other 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	:	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	i	got	a	call	from	a	man	who	was	19	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	who	was	born	a	boy	,	raised	a	boy	,	had	a	girlfriend	,	had	 s 	 ex 	 	with	his	girlfriend	,	had	a	life	 a 	 s 	 	a	guy	and	had	just	found	out	that	he	had	 ov 	 aries 	 	and	a	uterus	 in 	 side 	 	.
what	he	had	was	an	 extrem 	 e 	 	form	of	a	condition	 call 	 ed 	 	 con 	 genital 	 	adrenal	_UNK_	.
he	had	xx	 chromosom 	 es 	 	,	and	in	the	womb	,	his	adrenal	 g 	 land 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	in	 s 	 uch 	 	high	gear	that	it	 create 	 d 	 	,	 essential 	 ly 	 	,	a	 mascu 	 line 	 	hormonal	environment	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	a	 con 	 sequence 	 	,	his	 genital 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	_UNK_	,	his	brain	was	subject	to	the	more	typical	 mascu 	 line 	 	component	of	 hormone 	 s 	 	.
and	he	was	born	looking	like	a	boy	--	 no 	 body 	 	 suspect 	 ed 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	.
and	it	was	 on 	 ly 	 	when	he	had	 reach 	 ed 	 	the	age	of	19	that	he	 beg 	 an 	 	to	have	 en 	 ough 	 	medical	 problem 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	from	 menstru 	 ating 	 	 internal 	 ly 	 	,	that	 doctor 	 s 	 	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	that	,	in	fact	,	he	was	female	 internal 	 ly 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	just	one	more	quick	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	a	way	you	can	have	intersex	.
some	people	who	have	xx	 chromosom 	 es 	 	develop	what	are	 call 	 ed 	 	_UNK_	,	which	is	when	you	have	 ov 	 arian 	 	tissue	with	 test 	 icular 	 	tissue	 wrap 	 ped 	 	around	it	.
and	we	're	not	 exact 	 ly 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	why	that	 happen 	 s 	 	.
so	 s 	 ex 	 	can	come	in	 lot 	 s 	 	of	different	 varie 	 ties 	 	.
the	reason	that	children	with	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	bodies	--	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	dwarfism	,	or	it	's	 con 	 join 	 ed 	 	_UNK_	,	or	it	's	an	intersex	type	--	are	often	 normal 	 ized 	 	by	 surgeon 	 s 	 	is	not	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 leav 	 es 	 	them	better	off	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	physical	health	.
in	 man 	 y 	 	 case 	 s 	 	,	people	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 health 	 y 	 	.
the	reason	they	're	often	subject	to	 vari 	 ous 	 	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 s 	 urge 	 ries 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	they	threaten	our	social	 categor 	 ies 	 	.
or	system	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	based	 typical 	 ly 	 	on	the	idea	that	a	 part 	 icular 	 	kind	of	anatomy	 come 	 s 	 	with	a	 part 	 icular 	 	 ident 	 ity 	 	.
so	we	have	the	 con 	 cept 	 	that	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	to	be	a	woman	is	to	have	a	female	 ident 	 ity 	 	;	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	to	be	a	black	person	is	,	 alle 	 ged 	 ly 	 	,	is	to	have	an	african	anatomy	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	your	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
and	so	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	 terr 	 ibly 	 	 simpl 	 istic 	 	idea	.
and	when	we	're	 face 	 d 	 	with	a	body	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 present 	 s 	 	us	 some 	 thing 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	different	,	it	_UNK_	us	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 categor 	 ization 	 s 	 	.
so	we	have	a	lot	of	 ver 	 y 	 	romantic	 idea 	 s 	 	in	our	culture	about	 individual 	 ism 	 	.
and	our	nation	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 found 	 ed 	 	on	a	 ver 	 y 	 	romantic	 con 	 cept 	 	of	 individual 	 ism 	 	.
when	you	have	children	that	are	born	who	are	two	people	 in 	 side 	 	of	one	body	.
where	i	ran	 in 	 to 	 	the	most	heat	from	 th 	 is 	 	most	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	was	last	year	the	south	african	runner	,	caster	semenya	,	had	her	 s 	 ex 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	question	at	the	 inter 	 national 	 	 game 	 s 	 	in	berlin	.
i	had	a	lot	of	 journalist 	 s 	 	 call 	 ing 	 	me	,	 ask 	 ing 	 	me	,	``	which	is	the	test	they	're	going	to	run	that	will	tell	us	 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	caster	semenya	is	male	or	female	?	``
and	i	had	to	explain	to	the	 journalist 	 s 	 	there	is	n't	 s 	 uch 	 	a	test	.
in	fact	,	we	now	know	that	 s 	 ex 	 	is	 complic 	 ated 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	that	we	have	to	admit	nature	 do 	 es 	 	n't	draw	the	line	for	us	between	male	and	female	,	or	between	male	and	intersex	and	female	and	intersex	;	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	draw	that	line	on	nature	.
so	what	we	have	is	a	sort	of	 situ 	 ation 	 	where	the	 far 	 ther 	 	our	science	 go 	 es 	 	,	the	more	we	have	to	admit	to	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	that	these	 categor 	 ies 	 	that	we	thought	of	 a 	 s 	 	 s 	 table 	 	 an 	 atomic 	 al 	 	 categor 	 ies 	 	that	 ma 	 pped 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	to	 s 	 table 	 	 ident 	 ity 	 	 categor 	 ies 	 	are	a	lot	more	 fuzz 	 y 	 	than	we	thought	.
and	it	's	not	just	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 s 	 ex 	 	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	race	,	which	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	be	 vast 	 ly 	 	more	 complic 	 ated 	 	than	our	 term 	 in 	 ology 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 allow 	 ed 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	we	look	,	we	get	 in 	 to 	 	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	 area 	 s 	 	.
we	look	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	about	the	fact	that	we	share	at	 l 	 east 	 	95	percent	of	our	dna	with	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	.
what	are	we	to	make	of	the	fact	that	we	differ	from	them	 on 	 ly 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	by	a	few	 nucleotide 	 s 	 	?
and	 a 	 s 	 	we	get	 far 	 ther 	 	and	 far 	 ther 	 	with	our	science	,	we	get	more	and	more	 in 	 to 	 	a	_UNK_	zone	where	we	have	to	 acknowledg 	 e 	 	that	the	 simpl 	 istic 	 	 categor 	 ies 	 	we	've	had	are	 prob 	 ably 	 	 over 	 ly 	 	 simpl 	 istic 	 	.	so	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 place 	 s 	 	in	human	life	.
one	of	the	 place 	 s 	 	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	it	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	in	our	culture	 to 	 day 	 	,	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	is	 battle 	 s 	 	over	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	life	and	the	end	of	life	.
we	have	difficult	 conversation 	 s 	 	about	at	what	point	we	decide	a	body	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	human	,	 s 	 uch 	 	that	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	different	right	than	a	 fet 	 al 	 	life	.
we	have	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	 conversation 	 s 	 	 now 	 a 	 day 	 s 	 	--	 prob 	 ably 	 	not	out	in	the	open	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	medicine	--	about	the	question	of	when	 some 	 body 	 	's	dead	.
in	the	past	,	our	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	never	had	to	struggle	so	much	with	 th 	 is 	 	question	of	when	 some 	 body 	 	was	dead	.
at	most	,	they	'd	stick	a	feather	on	 some 	 body 	 	's	nose	,	and	if	it	 twitch 	 ed 	 	,	they	did	n't	bury	them	yet	.
if	it	 stop 	 ped 	 	 twitch 	 ing 	 	,	you	bury	them	.
but	 to 	 day 	 	,	we	have	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	where	we	want	to	take	vital	 organ 	 s 	 	out	of	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	give	them	to	other	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	a	 con 	 sequence 	 	,	we	're	 s 	 tuck 	 	with	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	struggle	with	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	difficult	question	about	who	's	dead	,
and	 th 	 is 	 	 lead 	 s 	 	us	to	a	 re 	 ally 	 	difficult	 situ 	 ation 	 	where	we	do	n't	have	 s 	 uch 	 	simple	 categor 	 ies 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	've	had	before	.
now	you	might	think	that	all	 th 	 is 	 	 break 	 ing 	 	-	down	of	 categor 	 ies 	 	would	make	 some 	 body 	 	like	me	 re 	 ally 	 	happy	.
i	'm	a	 politic 	 al 	 	 progress 	 ive 	 	,	i	defend	people	with	 un 	 usual 	 	bodies	,	but	i	have	to	admit	to	you	that	it	 make 	 s 	 	me	nervous	.
 understand 	 ing 	 	that	these	 categor 	 ies 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	much	more	 un 	 s 	 table 	 	than	we	thought	 make 	 s 	 	me	tense	.
and	it	 make 	 s 	 	me	tense	from	the	point	of	view	of	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 demo 	 cracy 	 	.
so	in	order	to	tell	you	about	that	tension	,	i	have	to	first	admit	to	you	that	i	'm	a	huge	fan	of	the	 found 	 ing 	 	 father 	 s 	 	.
i	know	they	 we 	 re 	 	 racist 	 s 	 	,	i	know	they	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 exist 	 	,	but	they	 we 	 re 	 	great	.
i	mean	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	so	brave	and	so	bold	and	so	radical	in	what	they	did	that	i	find	 my 	 self 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	that	 che 	 es 	 y 	 	musical	``	1776	``	every	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	not	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	music	,	which	is	 total 	 ly 	 	 forget 	 table 	 	.
it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	of	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	1776	with	the	 found 	 ing 	 	 father 	 s 	 	.
the	 found 	 ing 	 	 father 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	,	for	my	point	of	view	,	the	original	 an 	 atomic 	 al 	 	 activist 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	why	.
what	they	 reject 	 ed 	 	was	an	 an 	 atomic 	 al 	 	 con 	 cept 	 	and	 replace 	 d 	 	it	with	 an 	 other 	 	one	that	was	radical	and	 beaut 	 iful 	 	and	held	us	for	200	 year 	 s 	 	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	you	all	recall	,	what	our	 found 	 ing 	 	 father 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 reject 	 ing 	 	was	a	 con 	 cept 	 	of	 mon 	 arch 	 y 	 	,
and	the	 mon 	 arch 	 y 	 	was	 bas 	 ically 	 	based	on	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 simpl 	 istic 	 	 con 	 cept 	 	of	anatomy	.
the	_UNK_	of	the	old	world	did	n't	have	a	 con 	 cept 	 	of	dna	,	but	they	did	have	a	 con 	 cept 	 	of	 birth 	 right 	 	.
they	had	a	 con 	 cept 	 	of	blue	blood	.
they	had	the	idea	that	the	people	who	would	be	in	 politic 	 al 	 	power	should	be	in	 politic 	 al 	 	power	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	blood	 be 	 ing 	 	 pass 	 ed 	 	down	from	 grand 	 father 	 	to	father	to	son	and	so	forth	.
the	 found 	 ing 	 	 father 	 s 	 	 reject 	 ed 	 	that	idea	,	and	they	 replace 	 d 	 	it	with	a	new	 an 	 atomic 	 al 	 	 con 	 cept 	 	,	and	that	 con 	 cept 	 	was	all	men	are	 create 	 d 	 	equal	.
they	 level 	 ed 	 	that	 play 	 ing 	 	field	and	 decide 	 d 	 	the	anatomy	that	 matter 	 ed 	 	was	the	 common 	 ality 	 	of	anatomy	,	not	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	anatomy	,
and	that	was	a	 re 	 ally 	 	radical	thing	to	do	.
now	they	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	it	in	part	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	part	of	an	 enlighten 	 ment 	 	system	where	two	 thing 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	growing	up	together	.
and	that	was	 demo 	 cracy 	 	growing	up	,	but	it	was	 al 	 so 	 	science	growing	up	at	the	same	time	.
and	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	clear	,	if	you	look	at	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	the	 found 	 ing 	 	 father 	 s 	 	,	a	lot	of	them	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	science	,
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	a	 con 	 cept 	 	of	a	 natural 	 istic 	 	world	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	moving	away	from	 super 	 natural 	 	 explan 	 ations 	 	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 reject 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	a	 super 	 natural 	 	 con 	 cept 	 	of	power	,	where	it	 transmit 	 ted 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	a	 ver 	 y 	 	vague	 con 	 cept 	 	of	 birth 	 right 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	moving	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	a	 natural 	 istic 	 	 con 	 cept 	 	.
and	if	you	look	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	in	the	 decla 	 ration 	 	of	 in 	 depend 	 ence 	 	,	they	talk	about	nature	and	nature	's	god	.
they	do	n't	talk	about	god	and	god	's	nature	.
they	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	power	of	nature	to	tell	us	who	we	are	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	that	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	coming	to	us	with	a	 con 	 cept 	 	that	was	about	 an 	 atomic 	 al 	 	 common 	 ality 	 	.
and	in	 do 	 ing 	 	so	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	setting	up	in	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	way	the	civil	 right 	 s 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	of	the	future	.
they	did	n't	think	of	it	that	way	,	but	they	did	it	for	us	,	and	it	was	great	.
so	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	 year 	 s 	 	 after 	 ward 	 	?
what	 happen 	 ed 	 	was	women	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	who	 want 	 ed 	 	the	right	to	vote	,	took	the	 found 	 ing 	 	 father 	 s 	 	'	 con 	 cept 	 	of	 an 	 atomic 	 al 	 	 common 	 ality 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	more	 import 	 ant 	 	than	 an 	 atomic 	 al 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	the	fact	that	we	have	a	uterus	and	 ov 	 aries 	 	is	not	significant	 en 	 ough 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	to	mean	that	we	should	n't	have	the	right	to	vote	,	the	right	to	full	 citizen 	 ship 	 	,	the	right	to	own	 proper 	 ty 	 	,	etc	.	,	 etc 	 . 	 	``
and	women	 success 	 fully 	 	 argu 	 ed 	 	that	.
next	came	the	 success 	 ful 	 	civil	 right 	 s 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	,	where	we	found	people	like	_UNK_	truth	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	,	``	ai	n't	i	a	woman	?	``
we	find	men	on	the	 march 	 ing 	 	lines	of	the	civil	 right 	 s 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	i	am	a	man	.	``
 aga 	 in 	 	,	people	of	color	 appeal 	 ing 	 	to	a	 common 	 ality 	 	of	anatomy	over	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	of	anatomy	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 success 	 fully 	 	.
we	see	the	same	thing	with	the	 dis 	 ability 	 	 right 	 s 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	.
the	problem	is	,	of	course	,	that	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	begin	to	look	at	all	that	 common 	 ality 	 	,	we	have	to	begin	to	question	why	we	maintain	certain	 division 	 s 	 	.
now	mind	you	,	i	want	to	maintain	some	 division 	 s 	 	,	 an 	 atomic 	 ally 	 	,	in	our	culture	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	i	do	n't	want	to	give	a	fish	the	same	 right 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	human	.
i	do	n't	want	to	say	we	give	up	 entire 	 ly 	 	on	anatomy	.
i	do	n't	want	to	say	five	-	year	-	olds	should	be	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	consent	to	 s 	 ex 	 	or	consent	to	marry	.
so	there	are	some	 an 	 atomic 	 al 	 	 division 	 s 	 	that	make	sense	to	me	and	that	i	think	we	should	retain	.
but	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	is	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	which	 one 	 s 	 	they	are	and	why	do	we	retain	them	and	do	they	have	meaning	.
so	let	's	go	back	to	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	 conceiv 	 ed 	 	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	talk	.
we	have	two	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	both	 conceiv 	 ed 	 	in	the	middle	of	1979	on	the	exact	same	day	.
let	's	imagine	one	of	them	,	mary	,	is	born	three	 month 	 s 	 	 pre 	 mature 	 ly 	 	,	so	she	's	born	on	june	1	,	1980	.	henry	,	by	contrast	,	is	born	at	term	,	so	he	's	born	on	march	1	,	1980	.
 simpl 	 y 	 	by	virtue	of	the	fact	that	mary	was	born	 pre 	 mature 	 ly 	 	three	 month 	 s 	 	,	she	 come 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 right 	 s 	 	three	 month 	 s 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	than	henry	 do 	 es 	 	--	the	right	to	consent	to	 s 	 ex 	 	,	the	right	to	vote	,	the	right	to	drink	.
henry	 ha 	 s 	 	to	wait	for	all	of	that	,	not	 be 	 cause 	 	he	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	any	different	in	age	,	 bio 	 logically 	 	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	when	he	was	born	.
we	find	other	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 weird 	 ness 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	what	 the 	 ir 	 	 right 	 s 	 	are	.
henry	,	by	virtue	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 assum 	 ed 	 	to	be	male	--	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	i	have	n't	told	you	that	he	's	the	xy	one	--	by	virtue	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 assum 	 ed 	 	to	be	male	is	now	 li 	 able 	 	to	be	 draft 	 ed 	 	,	which	mary	 do 	 es 	 	not	need	to	worry	about	.
mary	,	 mean 	 while 	 	,	can	not	in	all	the	 state 	 s 	 	have	the	same	right	that	henry	 ha 	 s 	 	in	all	the	 state 	 s 	 	,	 name 	 ly 	 	,	the	right	to	marry	.
henry	can	marry	in	every	state	a	woman	,	but	mary	can	 on 	 ly 	 	marry	 to 	 day 	 	in	a	few	 state 	 s 	 	a	woman	.
so	we	have	these	 an 	 atomic 	 al 	 	 categor 	 ies 	 	that	persist	that	are	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	 problem 	 atic 	 	and	 question 	 able 	 	.
and	the	question	to	me	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	:	what	do	we	do	,	 a 	 s 	 	our	science	 get 	 s 	 	to	be	so	good	in	looking	at	anatomy	,	that	we	reach	the	point	where	we	have	to	admit	that	a	 demo 	 cracy 	 	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	based	on	anatomy	might	start	 fall 	 ing 	 	 a 	 part 	 	?
i	do	n't	want	to	give	up	the	science	,	but	at	the	same	time	it	kind	of	 feel 	 s 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	like	the	science	is	coming	out	from	under	us	.
so	where	do	we	go	?
it	 seem 	 s 	 	like	what	 happen 	 s 	 	in	our	culture	is	a	sort	of	 pragmat 	 ic 	 	attitude	:	``	well	,	we	have	to	draw	the	line	 some 	 where 	 	,	so	we	will	draw	the	line	 some 	 where 	 	.	``
but	a	lot	of	people	get	 s 	 tuck 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	strange	position	.
so	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	texas	 ha 	 s 	 	at	one	point	 decide 	 d 	 	that	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	to	marry	a	man	is	to	mean	that	you	do	n't	have	a	y	 chromosom 	 e 	 	,	and	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	to	marry	a	woman	 mean 	 s 	 	you	do	have	a	y	 chromosom 	 e 	 	.
now	in	practice	they	do	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	test	people	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 chromosom 	 es 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	bizarre	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	story	i	told	you	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	about	androgen	insensitivity	syndrome	.
if	we	look	at	one	of	the	 found 	 ing 	 	 father 	 s 	 	of	modern	 demo 	 cracy 	 	,	dr.	martin	luther	king	,	he	 off 	 ers 	 	us	 some 	 thing 	 	of	a	solution	in	his	``	i	have	a	dream	``	speech	.
he	 say 	 s 	 	we	should	 judg 	 e 	 	people	``	based	not	on	the	color	of	 the 	 ir 	 	skin	,	but	on	the	content	of	 the 	 ir 	 	character	,	``	moving	beyond	anatomy	.
and	i	want	to	say	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	,	that	 sound 	 s 	 	like	a	 re 	 ally 	 	good	idea	.	``
but	in	practice	,	how	do	you	do	it	?
how	do	you	 judg 	 e 	 	people	based	on	the	content	of	character	?
i	 al 	 so 	 	want	to	point	out	that	i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	that	is	how	we	should	 distribut 	 e 	 	 right 	 s 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 human 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	i	have	to	admit	,	that	there	are	some	 gold 	 en 	 	retrievers	i	know	that	are	 prob 	 ably 	 	more	 de 	 serv 	 ing 	 	of	social	 service 	 s 	 	than	some	 human 	 s 	 	i	know	.
i	 al 	 so 	 	want	to	say	there	are	 prob 	 ably 	 	 al 	 so 	 	some	yellow	_UNK_	that	i	know	that	are	more	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 inform 	 ed 	 	,	intelligent	,	mature	 decision 	 s 	 	about	sexual	 relation 	 s 	 	than	some	40	-	year	-	olds	that	i	know	.
so	how	do	we	 operation 	 al 	 ize 	 	the	question	of	content	of	character	?
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	be	 re 	 ally 	 	difficult	.
and	part	of	me	 al 	 so 	 	 wonder 	 s 	 	,	what	if	content	of	character	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	be	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	_UNK_	in	the	future	--	able	to	be	 s 	 een 	 	with	an	fmri	?
do	we	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	go	there	?
i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	where	we	go	.
what	i	do	know	is	that	it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	think	about	the	idea	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	in	the	lead	of	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	issue	of	 demo 	 cracy 	 	.
we	've	 d 	 one 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	good	job	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	with	 demo 	 cracy 	 	,	and	i	think	we	would	do	a	good	job	in	the	future	.
we	do	n't	have	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	that	iran	 ha 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	where	a	man	who	's	 sexual 	 ly 	 	 attract 	 ed 	 	to	other	men	is	 li 	 able 	 	to	be	 murder 	 ed 	 	,	 un 	 less 	 	he	's	 will 	 ing 	 	to	submit	to	a	 s 	 ex 	 	change	,	in	which	case	he	's	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	live	.
we	do	n't	have	that	kind	of	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
i	'm	glad	to	say	we	do	n't	have	the	kind	of	 situ 	 ation 	 	with	--	a	surgeon	i	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	who	had	 br 	 ought 	 	over	a	set	of	 con 	 join 	 ed 	 	 t 	 win 	 s 	 	in	order	to	 separat 	 e 	 	them	,	 part 	 ly 	 	to	make	a	name	for	 him 	 self 	 	.
but	when	i	was	on	the	phone	with	him	,	 ask 	 ing 	 	why	he	was	going	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	high	-	risk	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	--	his	answer	was	that	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	other	nation	,	these	children	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	be	 treat 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 bad 	 ly 	 	,	and	so	he	had	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
my	 respons 	 e 	 	to	him	was	,	``	well	,	have	you	 consider 	 ed 	 	 politic 	 al 	 	asylum	 in 	 stead 	 	of	a	 separat 	 ion 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	?	``
the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	tremendous	 possibil 	 ity 	 	for	 allow 	 ing 	 	people	to	be	the	way	they	are	,	 with 	 out 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	them	have	to	be	 change 	 d 	 	for	the	sake	of	the	state	.
so	i	think	we	have	to	be	in	the	lead	.
well	,	just	to	close	,	i	want	to	suggest	to	you	that	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	a	lot	about	the	 father 	 s 	 	.
and	i	want	to	think	about	the	 possibil 	 ities 	 	of	what	 demo 	 cracy 	 	might	look	like	,	or	might	have	 look 	 ed 	 	like	,	if	we	had	more	 involve 	 d 	 	the	 mother 	 s 	 	.
and	i	want	to	say	 some 	 thing 	 	a	little	bit	radical	for	a	feminist	,	and	that	is	that	i	think	that	there	may	be	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 in 	 sight 	 s 	 	that	can	come	from	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	_UNK_	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	when	we	have	people	 think 	 ing 	 	in	 group 	 s 	 	.
now	for	 year 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	intersex	,	i	've	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 s 	 ex 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 	research	.
and	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	is	looking	at	the	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	between	 male 	 s 	 	and	 female 	 s 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	way	they	think	and	 oper 	 ate 	 	in	the	world	.
and	what	we	know	from	cross	-	cultural	 stud 	 ies 	 	is	that	 female 	 s 	 	,	on	average	--	not	 every 	 one 	 	,	but	on	average	--	are	more	 inc 	 lined 	 	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	attentive	to	complex	social	 relation 	 s 	 	and	to	taking	care	of	people	who	are	 bas 	 ically 	 	 vulner 	 able 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	group	.
and	so	if	we	think	about	that	,	we	have	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	on	our	 hand 	 s 	 	.
 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	when	i	was	in	graduate	school	,	one	of	my	graduate	 advise 	 rs 	 	who	 k 	 new 	 	i	was	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 femin 	 ism 	 	--	i	 consider 	 ed 	 	 my 	 self 	 	a	feminist	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	still	do	--	 ask 	 ed 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	strange	question	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	tell	me	what	's	 femin 	 ine 	 	about	 femin 	 ism 	 	.	``
and	i	thought	,	``	well	that	's	the	 dumb 	 est 	 	question	i	've	ever	heard	.
 femin 	 ism 	 	is	all	about	 un 	 do 	 ing 	 	 stereo 	 type 	 s 	 	about	gender	,	so	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	 femin 	 ine 	 	about	 femin 	 ism 	 	.	``
but	the	more	i	thought	about	his	question	,	the	more	i	thought	there	might	be	 some 	 thing 	 	 femin 	 ine 	 	about	 femin 	 ism 	 	.
that	is	to	say	,	there	might	be	 some 	 thing 	 	,	on	average	,	different	about	female	 brain 	 s 	 	from	male	 brain 	 s 	 	that	 make 	 s 	 	us	more	attentive	to	 deep 	 ly 	 	complex	social	 relationship 	 s 	 	and	more	attentive	to	taking	care	of	the	 vulner 	 able 	 	.
so	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 father 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	attentive	to	 figur 	 ing 	 	out	how	to	protect	 individual 	 s 	 	from	the	state	,	it	's	possible	that	if	we	 inject 	 ed 	 	more	 mother 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 cept 	 	,	what	we	would	have	is	more	of	a	 con 	 cept 	 	of	,	not	just	how	to	protect	,	but	how	to	care	for	each	other	.
and	 may 	 be 	 	that	's	where	we	need	to	go	in	the	future	,	when	we	take	 demo 	 cracy 	 	beyond	anatomy	,	is	to	think	less	about	the	individual	body	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	 ident 	 ity 	 	,	and	think	more	about	 t 	 hose 	 	 relationship 	 s 	 	.
so	that	 a 	 s 	 	we	the	people	try	to	create	a	more	perfect	 un 	 ion 	 	,	we	're	 think 	 ing 	 	about	what	we	do	for	each	other	.
