i	'm	rich	baraniuk	.
and	what	i	'd	like	to	talk	a	little	bit	about	 to 	 day 	 	are	some	 idea 	 s 	 	that	i	think	have	just	tremendous	 reson 	 ance 	 	with	all	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	the	last	two	 day 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	so	 man 	 y 	 	different	 point 	 s 	 	of	 reson 	 ance 	 	that	it	's	going	to	be	difficult	to	 br 	 ing 	 	them	all	up	,	but	i	'll	try	to	do	my	best	.
 do 	 es 	 	 any 	 body 	 	remember	these	?
ok	,	so	these	are	lp	 record 	 s 	 	and	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	 replace 	 d 	 	,	right	?
they	've	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 wept 	 	away	over	the	last	two	 decade 	 s 	 	by	these	 type 	 s 	 	of	world	-	 flatten 	 ing 	 	 digit 	 ization 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	right	?
and	i	think	it	was	best	 witness 	 ed 	 	when	thomas	was	 play 	 ing 	 	the	music	 a 	 s 	 	we	came	in	the	room	 to 	 day 	 	.
what	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	music	world	is	there	's	a	culture	or	an	 eco 	 system 	 	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	 create 	 d 	 	that	,	if	you	take	some	 word 	 s 	 	from	apple	,	the	 catch 	 phrase 	 	that	we	create	,	rip	,	mix	and	burn	.
what	i	mean	by	that	is	that	 any 	 one 	 	in	the	world	is	free	and	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	create	new	music	and	musical	 idea 	 s 	 	.
 any 	 one 	 	in	the	world	is	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	rip	or	copy	musical	 idea 	 s 	 	,	use	them	in	 innov 	 ative 	 	ways	.
 any 	 one 	 	is	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	mix	them	in	different	 type 	 s 	 	of	ways	,	draw	 connect 	 ions 	 	between	musical	 idea 	 s 	 	and	people	can	burn	them	or	create	final	 product 	 s 	 	and	 continu 	 e 	 	the	circle	.
and	what	that	's	 d 	 one 	 	is	it	's	 create 	 d 	 	,	like	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	a	 vib 	 rant 	 	community	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	inclusive	with	people	 continu 	 ally 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	to	connect	musical	 idea 	 s 	 	,	 innov 	 ate 	 	them	and	keep	 thing 	 s 	 	 constant 	 ly 	 	up	to	date	.
 to 	 day 	 	's	hit	single	is	not	last	year	's	hit	single	.
but	,	i	'm	not	here	to	talk	about	music	 to 	 day 	 	.
i	'm	here	to	talk	about	 book 	 s 	 	.
in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	 text 	 book 	 s 	 	and	the	kind	of	 education 	 al 	 	 material 	 s 	 	that	we	use	every	day	in	school	.
 ha 	 s 	 	 any 	 one 	 	here	ever	 be 	 en 	 	to	school	?
ok	,	 do 	 es 	 	 any 	 body 	 	 real 	 ize 	 	there	's	a	crisis	in	our	 school 	 s 	 	,	around	the	world	?
ok	,	i	'm	not	going	to	 s 	 pend 	 	too	much	time	on	that	,	but	what	i	want	to	talk	about	is	some	of	the	 dis 	 connect 	 s 	 	that	appear	when	an	author	 publish 	 es 	 	a	book	that	in	fact	,	the	 publish 	 ing 	 	process	--	just	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	fact	that	it	's	 complic 	 ated 	 	,	it	's	heavy	,	 book 	 s 	 	are	expensive	--	 create 	 s 	 	a	sort	of	a	wall	between	 author 	 s 	 	of	 book 	 s 	 	and	the	ultimate	 user 	 s 	 	of	 book 	 s 	 	,	be	they	 teacher 	 s 	 	,	 student 	 s 	 	or	just	general	 read 	 ers 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	even	more	true	if	you	happen	to	speak	a	language	other	than	one	of	the	world	's	major	 language 	 s 	 	,	and	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	english	.
and	i	'm	going	to	call	these	people	 be 	 low 	 	the	 bar 	 rier 	 	shut	-	 out 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 re 	 ally 	 	shut	out	of	the	process	of	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	share	 the 	 ir 	 	knowledge	with	the	world	.
and	so	what	i	want	to	talk	about	 to 	 day 	 	is	 try 	 ing 	 	to	take	these	 idea 	 s 	 	that	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	in	the	musical	culture	and	try	to	 br 	 ing 	 	these	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 re 	 invent 	 ing 	 	the	way	we	think	about	writing	 book 	 s 	 	,	using	them	and	 teach 	 ing 	 	from	them	.
so	,	that	's	what	i	'd	like	to	talk	about	and	 re 	 ally 	 	,	how	do	we	get	from	where	we	are	now	to	where	we	need	to	go	?
so	,	the	first	thing	i	'd	like	you	to	do	is	a	little	thought	experiment	.
so	,	imagine	taking	all	the	world	's	 book 	 s 	 	.
ok	,	 every 	 body 	 	imagine	 book 	 s 	 	and	imagine	just	 tear 	 ing 	 	out	the	 page 	 s 	 	.
so	,	 liber 	 ating 	 	these	 page 	 s 	 	and	imagine	 digit 	 izing 	 	them	and	then	storing	them	in	a	vast	,	 interconnect 	 ed 	 	,	global	 re 	 posit 	 ory 	 	.
think	of	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	massive	itunes	for	book	type	content	.
and	then	take	that	material	and	imagine	making	it	all	open	,	so	that	people	can	modify	it	,	play	with	it	,	improve	it	.
imagine	making	it	free	,	so	that	 any 	 one 	 	in	the	world	can	have	access	to	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	knowledge	,	and	imagine	using	information	technology	so	that	you	can	update	 th 	 is 	 	content	,	improve	it	,	play	with	it	,	on	a	 time 	 scale 	 	that	's	more	on	the	order	of	 second 	 s 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	 ed 	 ition 	 s 	 	coming	out	every	two	 year 	 s 	 	,	of	a	book	,	imagine	it	coming	out	every	25	 second 	 s 	 	.
so	,	imagine	we	could	do	that	and	imagine	we	could	put	people	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	that	we	could	 tru 	 ly 	 	build	an	 eco 	 system 	 	with	not	just	 author 	 s 	 	,	but	all	the	people	who	could	be	or	want	to	be	 author 	 s 	 	in	all	the	different	 language 	 s 	 	of	the	world	,	and	i	think	if	you	could	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	it	would	be	 call 	 ed 	 	,	well	,	i	'm	just	going	to	refer	to	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	knowledge	 eco 	 system 	 	.
so	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	dream	and	in	a	sense	what	you	can	think	of	it	is	we	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 en 	 able 	 	 any 	 one 	 	in	the	world	,	i	mean	 any 	 one 	 	in	the	world	,	to	be	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 education 	 al 	 	dj	,
creating	 education 	 al 	 	 material 	 s 	 	,	sharing	them	with	the	world	,	 constant 	 ly 	 	 innov 	 ating 	 	on	them	.	so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	dream	.
in	fact	,	 th 	 is 	 	dream	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 real 	 ized 	 	.
over	the	last	six	-	and	-	a	-	half	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	at	rice	university	on	a	project	 call 	 ed 	 	connexions	,	and	so	what	i	'd	like	to	do	for	the	rest	of	the	talk	is	just	tell	you	a	little	bit	about	what	people	are	 do 	 ing 	 	with	connexions	,	which	you	can	kind	of	think	of	 a 	 s 	 	the	 counter 	 point 	 	to	nicholas	negroponte	's	talk	 yester 	 day 	 	,	where	they	're	 work 	 ing 	 	on	the	 hard 	 ware 	 	of	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	education	to	the	world	.
we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	on	the	open	-	source	 tool 	 s 	 	and	the	content	.
so	,	that	's	sort	of	to	put	it	in	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	here	.
so	,	create	.	so	what	are	some	of	the	people	that	are	using	these	kind	of	 tool 	 s 	 	?
well	,	the	first	thing	is	there	's	a	community	of	 engineer 	 ing 	 	 professor 	 s 	 	,	from	cambridge	to	kyoto	,	who	are	 develop 	 ing 	 	 engineer 	 ing 	 	content	in	 electric 	 al 	 	 engineer 	 ing 	 	to	develop	what	you	can	think	of	 a 	 s 	 	a	massive	,	super	 text 	 book 	 	that	 cover 	 s 	 	the	entire	area	of	 electric 	 al 	 	 engineer 	 ing 	 	--	and	not	 on 	 ly 	 	that	,	it	can	be	 custom 	 ized 	 	for	use	in	each	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	individual	 institution 	 s 	 	.
if	people	like	 kit 	 ty 	 	jones	--	right	,	a	shut	-	out	--	a	private	music	teacher	and	mom	from	 champ 	 agne 	 	,	illinois	,	who	 want 	 ed 	 	to	share	her	fantastic	music	content	with	the	world	,	on	how	to	teach	 kid 	 s 	 	how	to	play	music	.
her	material	is	now	used	over	600,000	 time 	 s 	 	per	month	.
tremendous	,	tremendous	use	.
in	fact	,	a	lot	of	 th 	 is 	 	use	coming	from	 un 	 ites 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	k	-	through	-	12	 school 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 any 	 one 	 	who	's	 involve 	 d 	 	in	a	school	scale	back	,	the	first	thing	that	's	cut	is	the	music	curriculum	and	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	 indic 	 ating 	 	the	tremendous	thirst	for	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	open	,	free	content	.
a	lot	of	 teacher 	 s 	 	are	using	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	.	ok	,	what	about	 rip 	 ping 	 	?
what	about	 copy 	 ing 	 	,	 re 	 using 	 	,	right	?
a	team	of	 volunteer 	 s 	 	at	the	university	of	texas	el	paso	,	graduate	 student 	 s 	 	 transl 	 ating 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 engineer 	 ing 	 	super	 text 	 book 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	and	 with 	 in 	 	about	a	week	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	be	some	of	our	most	popular	material	in	 wide 	 spread 	 	use	all	over	latin	america	and	in	 part 	 icular 	 	in	mexico	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	open	 extens 	 ible 	 	nature	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
people	,	 volunteer 	 s 	 	and	even	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	that	are	 transl 	 ating 	 	material	 in 	 to 	 	asian	 language 	 s 	 	like	chinese	,	japanese	and	thai	,	to	spread	the	knowledge	even	further	.
ok	,	what	about	people	who	are	 mix 	 ing 	 	?	what	 do 	 es 	 	``	 mix 	 ing 	 	``	mean	?
``	 mix 	 ing 	 	``	 mean 	 s 	 	building	 custom 	 ized 	 	 course 	 s 	 	,	 mean 	 s 	 	building	 custom 	 ized 	 	 book 	 s 	 	.
 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	like	national	 instrument 	 s 	 	,	who	are	 embed 	 d 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	,	 inter 	 active 	 	 simul 	 ations 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 material 	 s 	 	,	so	that	we	can	go	way	beyond	our	regular	kind	of	 text 	 book 	 	to	an	experience	that	all	the	 teach 	 ing 	 	 material 	 s 	 	are	 thing 	 s 	 	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	interact	with	and	play	around	with	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	learn	 a 	 s 	 	you	do	.
we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	with	 teacher 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 border 	 s 	 	who	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 mix 	 ing 	 	our	 material 	 s 	 	.
they	're	going	to	be	using	connexions	 a 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	platform	to	develop	and	deliver	 teach 	 ing 	 	 material 	 s 	 	for	 teach 	 ing 	 	 teacher 	 s 	 	how	to	teach	in	84	 count 	 ries 	 	that	are	around	the	world	.
twb	is	 current 	 ly 	 	in	 ir 	 aq 	 	training	20,000	 teacher 	 s 	 	 support 	 ed 	 	by	usaid	and	to	them	,	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	remix	and	 custom 	 ize 	 	to	the	local	 con 	 text 	 	is	 extra 	 ordinari 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	just	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	free	content	to	people	 ha 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 like 	 ned 	 	by	people	in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	to	a	kind	of	cultural	 imperial 	 ism 	 	,	that	if	you	do	n't	empower	people	with	the	ability	to	re	-	 contextual 	 ize 	 	the	material	,	 transl 	 ate 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	language	and	take	 owner 	 ship 	 	of	it	,	it	's	not	good	.
ok	,	other	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	with	,	uc	merced	,	people	know	about	uc	merced	.
it	's	a	new	university	in	california	,	in	the	central	 val 	 ley 	 	,	 work 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 close 	 ly 	 	with	community	 college 	 s 	 	.
they	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 develop 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	 the 	 ir 	 	science	and	 engineer 	 ing 	 	curriculum	to	spread	 wide 	 ly 	 	around	the	world	in	our	system	and	they	're	 al 	 so 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	develop	all	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 soft 	 ware 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	open	-	source	.
we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	with	amd	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	a	project	 call 	 ed 	 	50	by	'15	,	which	is	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	 inter 	 net 	 	 connect 	 ivity 	 	to	50	percent	of	the	world	's	population	by	2015	.
we	're	going	to	be	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	content	to	them	in	a	whole	range	of	different	 language 	 s 	 	.	and	we	've	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	with	a	number	of	other	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	.
in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	a	bunch	of	the	 project 	 s 	 	that	are	funded	by	hewlett	 found 	 ation 	 	,	who	have	taken	a	real	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	role	in	 th 	 is 	 	area	of	open	content	.
ok	,	burn	,	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	sort	of	,	 quit 	 e 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
``	burn	``	is	the	idea	of	 try 	 ing 	 	to	create	the	physical	 instant 	 iation 	 	of	one	of	these	 course 	 s 	 	.	and	i	think	a	lot	of	you	 receiv 	 ed 	 	,	i	think	all	of	you	 receiv 	 ed 	 	one	of	these	music	 book 	 s 	 	in	your	gift	pack	.
a	little	present	for	you	.
just	to	tell	you	 quick 	 ly 	 	about	it	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 engineer 	 ing 	 	 text 	 book 	 	.
it	's	about	300	 page 	 s 	 	long	,	 hard 	 bound 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	,	 any 	 body 	 	guess	?
how	much	would	it	cost	in	a	 book 	 store 	 	?
audience	:	65	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
richard	baraniuk	:	 th 	 is 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	22	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	the	student	.
why	 do 	 es 	 	it	cost	22	 dollar 	 s 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 publish 	 ed 	 	on	demand	and	it	's	 develop 	 ed 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 posit 	 ory 	 	of	open	 material 	 s 	 	.
if	 th 	 is 	 	book	 we 	 re 	 	to	be	 publish 	 ed 	 	by	a	regular	 publish 	 er 	 	,	it	would	cost	at	 l 	 east 	 	122	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
so	what	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	is	moving	 th 	 is 	 	 burn 	 ing 	 	or	 public 	 ation 	 	process	from	the	regular	sort	of	single	-	 author 	 ed 	 	book	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	community	-	 author 	 ed 	 	 material 	 s 	 	that	are	modular	,	that	are	 custom 	 ized 	 	to	each	individual	class	and	 publish 	 ed 	 	on	demand	 ver 	 y 	 	 in 	 expensive 	 ly 	 	,	either	 push 	 ed 	 	out	through	amazon	,	or	 publish 	 ed 	 	 direct 	 ly 	 	through	an	on	-	demand	press	,	like	 co 	 op 	 	.
and	i	think	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 extra 	 ordinari 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	area	 be 	 cause 	 	there	is	tremendous	area	under	 th 	 is 	 	long	tail	in	 publish 	 ing 	 	.
we	're	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	harry	potter	end	,	right	at	the	left	side	.
we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 book 	 s 	 	on	hyper	 geo 	 metric 	 	partial	 different 	 ial 	 	 equ 	 ations 	 	.
right	,	 book 	 s 	 	that	might	sell	100	copies	a	year	,	1,000	copies	a	year	.
there	is	tremendous	 sustain 	 ing 	 	revenue	under	 th 	 is 	 	long	tail	to	sustain	open	 project 	 s 	 	like	 our 	 s 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	to	sustain	 th 	 is 	 	new	emergence	of	on	-	demand	 publish 	 ers 	 	,	like	 co 	 op 	 	,	who	 produce 	 d 	 	these	two	 book 	 s 	 	.	and	i	think	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	should	take	away	from	 th 	 is 	 	talk	,	is	that	there	's	an	 imp 	 end 	 ing 	 	cut	-	out	-	the	-	middle	-	man	,	 dis 	 inter 	 media 	 tion 	 	,	that	's	going	to	be	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	the	 publish 	 ing 	 	industry	,	and	it	's	going	to	reach	a	crescendo	over	the	next	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	i	think	that	it	's	for	our	benefit	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	and	for	the	world	's	benefit	.
ok	,	so	what	are	the	 enabl 	 ers 	 	?
what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	making	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	happen	?
there	's	 ton 	 s 	 	of	technology	,	and	the	 on 	 ly 	 	piece	of	technology	that	i	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	talk	about	is	xml	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	people	know	about	xml	?
oh	,	great	,	so	it	's	the	future	of	the	web	,	right	?
it	's	semantic	 represent 	 ation 	 	of	comment	,	content	,	and	what	you	can	 re 	 ally 	 	think	of	xml	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	is	it	's	the	 pack 	 aging 	 	that	we	're	 put 	 ting 	 	around	these	 page 	 s 	 	.
remember	we	took	the	book	,	 to 	 re 	 	the	 page 	 s 	 	out	?
well	,	what	the	xml	is	going	to	do	is	it	's	going	to	turn	 t 	 hose 	 	 page 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	lego	 block 	 s 	 	.
xml	are	the	 nub 	 s 	 	on	the	lego	that	allow	us	to	combine	the	content	together	in	myriad	different	ways	,	and	it	 provide 	 s 	 	us	a	 frame 	 work 	 	to	share	content	.
so	,	it	lets	you	take	 th 	 is 	 	 eco 	 system 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	primordial	state	,	right	,	of	all	 th 	 is 	 	content	,	all	the	 page 	 s 	 	you	've	torn	out	of	 book 	 s 	 	,	and	create	 high 	 ly 	 	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	:
 book 	 s 	 	,	 course 	 s 	 	,	course	 pack 	 s 	 	.
it	 give 	 s 	 	you	the	ability	to	 personal 	 ize 	 	the	 learn 	 ing 	 	experience	to	each	individual	student	,	so	that	every	student	can	have	a	book	or	a	course	that	's	 custom 	 ized 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	style	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 con 	 text 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	language	and	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 excit 	 e 	 	them	.
it	lets	you	 re 	 use 	 	the	same	 material 	 s 	 	in	 multi 	 ple 	 	different	ways	and	surprising	new	ways	.
it	lets	you	interconnect	 idea 	 s 	 	 indic 	 ating 	 	how	 field 	 s 	 	 re 	 late 	 	to	each	other	,	and	i	'll	just	give	you	my	personal	story	.
we	came	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	six	-	and	-	a	-	half	 year 	 s 	 	ago	 be 	 cause 	 	i	teach	the	stuff	in	the	red	box	.
and	my	day	job	,	 a 	 s 	 	chris	 s 	 aid 	 	,	i	'm	an	 electric 	 al 	 	 engineer 	 ing 	 	professor	.
i	teach	signal	 process 	 ing 	 	and	my	 challeng 	 e 	 	was	to	show	that	 th 	 is 	 	math	--	 w 	 ow 	 	,	about	half	of	you	have	 al 	 ready 	 	 fall 	 en 	 	 a 	 sleep 	 	just	looking	at	the	 equ 	 ation 	 	--	but	 th 	 is 	 	 seem 	 ing 	 ly 	 	dry	math	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	center	of	 th 	 is 	 	 tremendous 	 ly 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	web	that	 link 	 s 	 	technology	--	that	 link 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	 application 	 s 	 	like	music	 synthesize 	 rs 	 	to	tremendous	economic	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 govern 	 ed 	 	by	intellectual	 proper 	 ty 	 	.
and	the	thing	that	i	 real 	 ized 	 	is	there	was	no	way	that	i	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	engineer	,	could	write	 th 	 is 	 	book	that	would	get	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	.
we	 need 	 ed 	 	a	community	to	do	it	and	we	 need 	 ed 	 	new	 tool 	 s 	 	to	be	able	to	interconnect	these	 idea 	 s 	 	,	and	i	think	that	 re 	 ally 	 	,	in	a	sense	,	what	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	is	make	minsky	's	dream	come	to	a	 re 	 ality 	 	,	where	you	can	imagine	all	the	 book 	 s 	 	in	a	library	 actual 	 ly 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	to	talk	to	each	other	.	and	people	who	are	 teacher 	 s 	 	out	here	,	 who 	 ever 	 	taught	,	you	know	 th 	 is 	 	--
it	's	the	 interconnect 	 ions 	 	between	 idea 	 s 	 	that	 teach 	 ing 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	all	about	.
ok	,	back	to	math	.	imagine	 th 	 is 	 	is	possible	--
that	every	single	 equ 	 ation 	 	that	you	click	on	in	one	of	your	new	 e 	 - 	 text 	 s 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	you	're	going	to	be	able	to	explore	and	experiment	with	.
so	imagine	your	kid	's	algebra	 text 	 book 	 	in	 seven 	 th 	 	grade	.
you	can	click	on	every	single	 equ 	 ation 	 	and	 br 	 ing 	 	up	a	little	tool	to	be	able	to	experiment	with	it	,	tinker	with	it	,	understand	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 re 	 ally 	 	do	n't	understand	 un 	 til 	 	we	do	.
the	same	type	of	mark	-	up	,	like	mathml	,	for	 chemist 	 ry 	 	.
imagine	 chemist 	 ry 	 	 text 	 book 	 s 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	understand	the	structure	of	how	 molecule 	 s 	 	are	 form 	 ed 	 	.
imagine	music	xml	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	lets	you	delve	 in 	 to 	 	the	semantic	structure	of	music	,	play	with	it	,	understand	it	.
it	's	no	wonder	that	 every 	 body 	 	's	 get 	 ting 	 	 in 	 to 	 	it	,	right	?
even	the	three	wise	men	.
ok	,	the	second	big	 enabl 	 er 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	i	told	a	big	lie	.
the	second	big	 enabl 	 er 	 	is	intellectual	 proper 	 ty 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	in	fact	i	got	up	here	and	i	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	how	great	the	music	culture	is	.
we	can	share	and	rip	,	mix	and	burn	,	but	in	fact	that	's	all	 il 	 legal 	 	.
and	we	would	be	 accus 	 ed 	 	of	 pirate 	 s 	 	for	 do 	 ing 	 	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	music	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 proper 	 t 	 ized 	 	.
it	's	now	owned	,	right	,	much	of	it	by	big	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	.
so	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	the	key	thing	here	is	we	ca	n't	let	 th 	 is 	 	happen	.
we	ca	n't	let	 th 	 is 	 	napster	thing	happen	here	.	so	,	what	we	have	to	do	is	get	it	right	from	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 begin 	 ning 	 	and	what	we	have	to	do	is	find	an	intellectual	 proper 	 ty 	 	 frame 	 work 	 	that	 make 	 s 	 	sharing	safe	,	and	 make 	 s 	 	it	 eas 	 ily 	 	 understand 	 able 	 	,	and	the	inspiration	here	is	taken	from	open	-	source	 soft 	 ware 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	like	linux	and	the	gpl	.
and	the	 idea 	 s 	 	,	the	creative	 common 	 s 	 	 licens 	 es 	 	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	people	have	heard	of	creative	 common 	 s 	 	?
if	you	have	not	,	you	must	learn	about	it	.	creativecommons.org	.
at	the	bottom	of	every	piece	of	material	in	connexions	and	in	 lot 	 s 	 	of	other	 project 	 s 	 	,	you	can	find	 the 	 ir 	 	logo	.
 click 	 ing 	 	on	that	logo	 take 	 s 	 	you	to	an	absolute	no	-	 non 	 sense 	 	,	human	-	 read 	 able 	 	document	,	a	 de 	 ed 	 	,	that	 tell 	 s 	 	you	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	you	can	do	with	 th 	 is 	 	content	.
in	fact	,	you	're	free	to	share	it	,	to	do	all	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	to	copy	it	,	to	change	it	,	even	to	make	commercial	use	of	it	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	you	 attribut 	 e 	 	the	author	.
 be 	 cause 	 	in	academic	 publish 	 ing 	 	and	much	of	 education 	 al 	 	 publish 	 ing 	 	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	sharing	knowledge	and	making	impact	that	's	why	people	write	,	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	making	 buck 	 s 	 	.
we	're	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	harry	potter	,	right	?	we	're	at	the	long	tail	end	here	.
 be 	 hind 	 	that	is	the	legal	code	,	so	if	you	want	to	 ver 	 y 	 	 care 	 fully 	 	construct	it	,	and	creative	 common 	 s 	 	is	taking	off	--
over	43	million	 thing 	 s 	 	out	there	,	 licens 	 ed 	 	with	a	creative	 common 	 s 	 	 licens 	 e 	 	.
not	just	text	,	but	music	,	 image 	 s 	 	,	video	,	and	there	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	tremendous	 up 	 take 	 	of	the	number	of	people	that	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 licens 	 ing 	 	music	to	make	it	free	for	people	who	do	 th 	 is 	 	whole	idea	of	re	-	 s 	 ampl 	 ing 	 	,	rip	,	 mix 	 ing 	 	,	 burn 	 ing 	 	and	sharing	.
so	i	'd	like	to	conclude	with	just	the	last	few	 point 	 s 	 	.
so	,	we	've	built	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	a	 common 	 s 	 	.	people	are	using	it	.
we	get	over	500,000	 un 	 ique 	 	 visit 	 ors 	 	per	month	,	just	to	our	 part 	 icular 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
mit	open	 course 	 ware 	 	,	which	is	 an 	 other 	 	large	open	-	content	 s 	 ite 	 	,	 get 	 s 	 	a	similar	number	of	 hit 	 s 	 	,	but	how	do	we	protect	 th 	 is 	 	?
how	do	we	protect	it	 in 	 to 	 	the	future	?	and	the	first	thing	that	people	are	 prob 	 ably 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	is	quality	control	,	right	?
 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	 say 	 ing 	 	that	 any 	 body 	 	can	 con 	 tribute 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	 common 	 s 	 	.	 any 	 body 	 	can	 con 	 tribute 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	.	so	that	could	be	a	problem	.
it	did	n't	take	long	 un 	 til 	 	people	 start 	 ed 	 	 con 	 trib 	 uting 	 	 material 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	on	 linger 	 ie 	 	,	which	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	 modul 	 e 	 	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	problem	is	it	's	 plagiar 	 ized 	 	from	a	major	french	feminist	journal	,	and	when	you	go	to	the	 suppose 	 d 	 	course	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	it	 point 	 s 	 	to	a	 linger 	 ie 	 	-	selling	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	little	bit	of	a	problem	,	so	we	 clear 	 ly 	 	need	some	kind	of	idea	of	quality	control	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	where	the	idea	of	review	and	peer	review	 come 	 s 	 	in	.
ok	,	you	come	to	ted	.	why	do	you	come	to	ted	?
 be 	 cause 	 	chris	and	his	team	have	 ensure 	 d 	 	that	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	high	quality	,	right	,	and	so	we	need	to	be	able	to	do	the	same	thing	.
and	we	need	to	be	able	to	design	 structure 	 s 	 	and	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	is	 design 	 ing 	 	social	 soft 	 ware 	 	to	 en 	 able 	 	 any 	 one 	 	to	build	 the 	 ir 	 	own	peer	review	process	,	and	we	call	these	 thing 	 s 	 	``	 lens 	 es 	 	.	``	and	 bas 	 ically 	 	what	they	allow	is	 any 	 one 	 	out	there	to	develop	 the 	 ir 	 	own	peer	review	process	,	so	that	they	can	focus	on	the	content	in	the	 re 	 posit 	 ory 	 	that	they	think	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	and	you	can	think	of	ted	 a 	 s 	 	a	potential	lens	.
so	i	'd	just	like	to	end	by	 say 	 ing 	 	,	you	can	 re 	 ally 	 	view	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	call	to	action	.
connexions	and	open	content	is	all	about	sharing	knowledge	.
all	of	you	here	are	 tremendous 	 ly 	 	 imbue 	 d 	 	with	tremendous	 amount 	 s 	 	of	knowledge	and	what	i	'd	like	to	do	is	 invit 	 e 	 	each	and	every	one	of	you	to	 con 	 tribute 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	project	and	other	 project 	 s 	 	of	 it 	 s 	 	type	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	together	we	can	 tru 	 ly 	 	change	the	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	of	education	and	 education 	 al 	 	 publish 	 ing 	 	.
so	,	 thank 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
