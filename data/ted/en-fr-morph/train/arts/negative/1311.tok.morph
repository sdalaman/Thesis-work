i	've	 be 	 en 	 	in	afghanistan	for	21	 year 	 s 	 	.
i	work	for	the	red	cross	and	i	'm	a	physical	therapist	.
my	job	is	to	make	 arm 	 s 	 	and	 leg 	 s 	 	--	well	it	's	not	 complete 	 ly 	 	true	.
we	do	more	than	that	.
we	provide	the	 patient 	 s 	 	,	the	afghan	 dis 	 able 	 d 	 	,	first	with	the	physical	 rehabilit 	 ation 	 	then	with	the	social	 re 	 integ 	 ration 	 	.
it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	logical	plan	,	but	it	was	not	 al 	 ways 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
for	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	just	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	them	with	artificial	 limb 	 s 	 	.
it	took	 quit 	 e 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	for	the	program	to	 be 	 come 	 	what	it	is	now	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	i	would	like	to	tell	you	a	story	,	the	story	of	a	big	change	,	and	the	story	of	the	people	who	made	 th 	 is 	 	change	possible	.
i	 arriv 	 ed 	 	in	afghanistan	in	1990	to	work	in	a	hospital	for	war	 victim 	 s 	 	.
and	then	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	for	war	 victim 	 s 	 	,	but	it	was	for	any	kind	of	patient	.
i	was	 al 	 so 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	in	the	 ortho 	 pedic 	 	center	,	we	call	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	place	where	we	make	the	 leg 	 s 	 	.
at	that	time	i	found	 my 	 self 	 	in	a	strange	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
i	felt	not	 quit 	 e 	 	ready	for	that	job	.
there	was	so	much	to	learn	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	so	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	new	to	me	.
but	it	was	a	 terr 	 ific 	 	job	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	the	 fight 	 ing 	 	 intens 	 ified 	 	,	the	physical	 rehabilit 	 ation 	 	was	 suspend 	 ed 	 	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	 man 	 y 	 	other	 thing 	 s 	 	to	do	.
so	the	 ortho 	 pedic 	 	center	was	closed	 be 	 cause 	 	physical	 rehabilit 	 ation 	 	was	not	 consider 	 ed 	 	a	 prior 	 ity 	 	.
it	was	a	strange	 sens 	 ation 	 	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	you	know	every	time	i	make	 th 	 is 	 	speech	--	it	's	not	the	first	time	--	but	it	's	an	emotion	.
it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 come 	 s 	 	out	from	the	past	.
it	's	21	 year 	 s 	 	,	but	they	are	still	all	there	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	in	1992	,	the	mujahideen	took	all	afghanistan	.
and	the	 ortho 	 pedic 	 	center	was	closed	.
i	was	 assign 	 ed 	 	to	work	for	the	 home 	 less 	 	,	for	the	 internal 	 ly 	 	 dis 	 place 	 d 	 	people	.
but	one	day	,	 some 	 thing 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
i	was	coming	back	from	a	big	food	 distribut 	 ion 	 	in	a	mosque	where	 ten 	 s 	 	and	 ten 	 s 	 	of	people	 we 	 re 	 	 squat 	 ting 	 	in	 terr 	 ible 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	go	home	.	i	was	 driv 	 ing 	 	.
you	know	,	when	you	want	to	forget	,	you	do	n't	want	to	see	 thing 	 s 	 	,	so	you	just	want	to	go	to	your	room	,	to	lock	 your 	 self 	 	 in 	 side 	 	and	say	,	``	that	's	 en 	 ough 	 	.	``
a	bomb	fell	not	far	from	my	car	--	well	,	far	 en 	 ough 	 	,	but	big	noise	.
and	 every 	 body 	 	 disappear 	 ed 	 	from	the	street	.
the	 car 	 s 	 	 disappear 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
i	 duck 	 ed 	 	.
and	 on 	 ly 	 	one	figure	 remain 	 ed 	 	in	the	middle	of	the	road	.
it	was	a	man	in	a	wheelchair	 desperate 	 ly 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	move	away	.
well	i	'm	not	a	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	brave	person	,	i	have	to	confess	it	,	but	i	could	not	just	 ignor 	 e 	 	him	.
so	i	 stop 	 ped 	 	the	car	and	i	went	to	help	.
the	man	was	 with 	 out 	 	 leg 	 s 	 	and	 on 	 ly 	 	with	one	arm	.
 be 	 hind 	 	him	there	was	a	child	,	his	son	,	red	in	the	face	in	an	effort	to	push	the	father	.
so	i	took	him	 in 	 to 	 	a	safe	place	.
and	i	ask	,	``	what	are	you	 do 	 ing 	 	out	in	the	street	in	 th 	 is 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	?	``	``	i	work	,	``	he	 s 	 aid 	 	.
i	 wonder 	 ed 	 	,	what	work	?
and	then	i	ask	an	even	more	stupid	question	:	``	why	do	n't	you	have	the	 pro 	 s 	 these 	 s 	 	?
why	do	n't	you	have	the	artificial	 leg 	 s 	 	?	``	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	the	red	cross	 ha 	 s 	 	closed	.	``	well	 with 	 out 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	,	i	told	him	``	come	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	.
we	will	provide	you	with	a	pair	of	 leg 	 s 	 	.	``	the	man	,	his	name	was	mahmoud	,	and	the	child	,	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	name	was	rafi	,	left	.
and	then	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	oh	,	my	god	.	what	did	i	say	?
the	center	is	closed	,	no	staff	around	.
 may 	 be 	 	the	 machine 	 ry 	 	is	broken	.
who	is	going	to	make	the	 leg 	 s 	 	for	him	?	``	so	i	 hop 	 ed 	 	that	he	would	not	come	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 street 	 s 	 	of	kabul	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 day 	 s 	 	.
so	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	i	will	give	him	some	money	.	``	and	so	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	day	,	i	went	to	the	 ortho 	 pedic 	 	center	.
and	i	spoke	with	a	 gate 	 keeper 	 	.
i	was	ready	to	tell	him	,	``	listen	,	if	 some 	 one 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	-	and	-	 s 	 uch 	 	 come 	 s 	 	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	tell	him	that	it	was	a	 mistak 	 e 	 	.
 noth 	 ing 	 	can	be	 d 	 one 	 	.
give	him	some	money	.	``	but	mahmoud	and	his	son	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	there	.
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	not	 al 	 one 	 	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	15	,	 may 	 be 	 	20	,	people	like	him	 wait 	 ing 	 	.
and	there	was	some	staff	too	.
among	them	there	was	my	right	-	hand	man	,	najmuddin	.
and	the	 gate 	 keeper 	 	told	me	,	``	they	come	 every 	 day 	 	to	see	if	the	center	will	open	.	``	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	.
we	have	to	go	away	.	we	can	not	stay	here	.	``	they	 we 	 re 	 	 bomb 	 ing 	 	--	not	 ver 	 y 	 	close	--	but	you	could	hear	the	noise	of	the	 bomb 	 s 	 	.
so	,	``	we	can	not	stay	here	,	it	's	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
it	's	not	a	 prior 	 ity 	 	.	``	but	najmuddin	told	me	,	``	listen	now	,	we	're	here	.	``	at	 l 	 east 	 	we	can	start	 repair 	 ing 	 	the	 pro 	 s 	 these 	 s 	 	,	the	broken	 pro 	 s 	 these 	 s 	 	of	the	people	and	 may 	 be 	 	try	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	for	people	like	mahmoud	.	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	.	we	can	not	do	that	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
we	have	other	 thing 	 s 	 	to	do	.	``	but	they	 insist 	 ed 	 	.
when	you	have	20	people	in	front	of	you	,	looking	at	you	and	you	are	the	one	who	 ha 	 s 	 	to	decide	...
so	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	some	 repair 	 s 	 	.
 al 	 so 	 	one	of	the	physical	 therapist 	 s 	 	 report 	 ed 	 	that	mahmoud	could	be	 provide 	 d 	 	with	a	leg	,	but	not	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	.
the	 leg 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	swollen	and	the	 knee 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	stiff	,	so	he	 need 	 ed 	 	a	long	 pre 	 par 	 ation 	 	.
 believ 	 e 	 	me	,	i	was	 worri 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	 break 	 ing 	 	the	 rule 	 s 	 	.
i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	was	not	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	do	.
in	the	 even 	 ing 	 	,	i	went	to	speak	with	the	 bo 	 s 	 s 	 es 	 	at	the	 head 	 quarter 	 s 	 	,	and	i	told	them	--	i	 li 	 ed 	 	--	i	told	them	,	``	listen	,	we	are	going	to	start	a	couple	of	 hour 	 s 	 	per	day	,	just	a	few	 repair 	 s 	 	.	``	 may 	 be 	 	some	of	them	are	here	now	.
so	we	 start 	 ed 	 	.
i	was	 work 	 ing 	 	,	i	was	going	 every 	 day 	 	to	work	for	the	 home 	 less 	 	.
and	najmuddin	was	 stay 	 ing 	 	there	,	 do 	 ing 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	and	 report 	 ing 	 	on	the	 patient 	 s 	 	.
he	was	 tell 	 ing 	 	me	,	``	 patient 	 s 	 	are	coming	.	``	we	 k 	 new 	 	that	 man 	 y 	 	more	 patient 	 s 	 	could	not	come	,	 prevent 	 ed 	 	by	the	 fight 	 ing 	 	.
but	people	 we 	 re 	 	coming	.
and	mahmoud	was	coming	every	day	.
and	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	,	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	week	after	week	his	 leg 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 improv 	 ing 	 	.
the	stump	or	cast	 pro 	 s 	 thesis 	 	was	made	,	and	he	was	 start 	 ing 	 	the	real	physical	 rehabilit 	 ation 	 	.
he	was	coming	every	day	,	 cross 	 ing 	 	the	front	line	.
a	couple	of	 time 	 s 	 	i	 cross 	 ed 	 	the	front	line	in	the	 ver 	 y 	 	place	where	mahmoud	and	his	son	 we 	 re 	 	 cross 	 ing 	 	.
i	tell	you	,	it	was	 some 	 thing 	 	so	 s 	 ini 	 ster 	 	that	i	was	 astonish 	 ed 	 	he	could	do	it	every	day	.
but	 final 	 ly 	 	,	the	great	day	 arriv 	 ed 	 	.
mahmoud	was	going	to	be	 dis 	 charged 	 	with	his	new	 leg 	 s 	 	.
it	was	april	,	i	remember	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	day	.
april	in	kabul	is	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	full	of	 rose 	 s 	 	,	full	of	 flower 	 s 	 	.
we	could	not	possibly	stay	 in 	 door 	 s 	 	,	with	all	these	 sand 	 bag 	 s 	 	at	the	 window 	 s 	 	.
 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 ad 	 	,	dark	.
so	we	chose	a	small	spot	in	the	garden	.
and	mahmoud	put	on	his	 pro 	 s 	 these 	 s 	 	,	the	other	 patient 	 s 	 	did	the	same	,	and	they	 start 	 ed 	 	 p 	 rac 	 tic 	 ing 	 	for	the	last	time	before	 be 	 ing 	 	 dis 	 charged 	 	.
 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	they	 start 	 ed 	 	 fight 	 ing 	 	.
two	 group 	 s 	 	of	mujahideen	 start 	 ed 	 	 fight 	 ing 	 	.
we	could	hear	in	the	air	the	 bullet 	 s 	 	 pass 	 ing 	 	.
so	we	 dash 	 ed 	 	,	all	of	us	,	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	shelter	.
mahmoud	 grab 	 bed 	 	his	son	,	i	 grab 	 bed 	 	 some 	 one 	 	else	.
 every 	 body 	 	was	 grab 	 bing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	.	and	we	ran	.
you	know	,	50	 meter 	 s 	 	can	be	a	long	distance	if	you	are	 total 	 ly 	 	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	,	but	we	 manage 	 d 	 	to	reach	the	shelter	.
 in 	 side 	 	,	all	of	us	 pan 	 ting 	 	,	i	 s 	 at 	 	a	moment	and	i	heard	rafi	 tell 	 ing 	 	his	father	,	``	father	,	you	can	run	 fast 	 er 	 	than	me	.	``	and	mahmoud	,	``	of	course	i	can	.
i	can	run	,	and	now	you	can	go	to	school	.
no	need	of	 stay 	 ing 	 	with	me	all	the	day	 push 	 ing 	 	my	wheelchair	.	``	 lat 	 er 	 	on	,	we	took	them	home	.
and	i	will	never	forget	mahmoud	and	his	son	 walk 	 ing 	 	together	 push 	 ing 	 	the	empty	wheelchair	.
and	then	i	 under 	 stood 	 	,	physical	 rehabilit 	 ation 	 	is	a	 prior 	 ity 	 	.
dignity	can	not	wait	for	better	 time 	 s 	 	.
from	that	day	on	,	we	never	closed	a	single	day	.
well	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	 suspend 	 ed 	 	for	a	few	 hour 	 s 	 	,	but	we	never	,	we	never	closed	it	 aga 	 in 	 	.
i	met	mahmoud	one	year	 lat 	 er 	 	.
he	was	in	good	shape	--	a	bit	 th 	 inner 	 	.
he	 need 	 ed 	 	to	change	his	 pro 	 s 	 these 	 s 	 	--	a	new	pair	of	 pro 	 s 	 these 	 s 	 	.
i	 ask 	 ed 	 	about	his	son	.
he	told	me	,	``	he	's	at	school	.	he	'd	 do 	 ing 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	well	.	``	but	i	 under 	 stood 	 	he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	tell	me	 some 	 thing 	 	.
so	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	him	,	``	what	is	that	?	``	he	was	 sweat 	 ing 	 	.
he	was	 clear 	 ly 	 	 embarrass 	 ed 	 	.
and	he	was	 stand 	 ing 	 	in	front	of	me	,	his	head	down	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	have	taught	me	to	walk	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
now	help	me	not	to	be	a	 beg 	 gar 	 	 any 	 more 	 	.	``	that	was	the	job	.
``	my	children	are	growing	.	i	feel	 a 	 shame 	 d 	 	.
i	do	n't	want	them	to	be	 teas 	 ed 	 	at	school	by	the	other	 student 	 s 	 	.	``	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	``
i	thought	,	how	much	money	do	i	have	in	my	pocket	?
just	to	give	him	some	money	.
it	was	the	 eas 	 iest 	 	way	.
he	read	my	mind	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	ask	for	a	job	.	``	and	then	he	 add 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	i	will	never	forget	for	the	rest	of	my	life	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	am	a	scrap	of	a	man	,	but	if	you	help	me	,	i	'm	ready	to	do	 any 	 thing 	 	,	even	if	i	have	to	crawl	on	the	ground	.	``	and	then	he	 s 	 at 	 	down	.
i	 s 	 at 	 	down	too	with	 goose 	 bump 	 s 	 	 every 	 where 	 	.
 leg 	 less 	 	,	with	 on 	 ly 	 	one	arm	,	illiterate	,	 un 	 skill 	 ed 	 	--	what	job	for	him	?
najmuddin	told	me	,	``	well	we	have	a	 vac 	 ancy 	 	in	the	 carp 	 entry 	 	shop	.	``	``	what	?	``	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	stop	.	``	``	well	 y 	 es 	 	,	we	need	to	 in 	 crease 	 	the	production	of	feet	.
we	need	to	employ	 some 	 one 	 	to	glue	and	to	screw	the	sole	of	the	feet	.
we	need	to	 in 	 crease 	 	the	production	.	``	``	excuse	me	?	``	i	could	not	 believ 	 e 	 	.
and	then	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	we	can	modify	the	 work 	 bench 	 	 may 	 be 	 	to	put	a	special	 s 	 tool 	 	,	a	special	 an 	 vil 	 	,	special	vice	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	an	electric	 screw 	 driver 	 	.	``	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	listen	,	it	's	 insan 	 e 	 	.
and	it	's	even	cruel	to	think	of	 any 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
that	's	a	production	line	and	a	 ver 	 y 	 	fast	one	.
it	's	cruel	to	 off 	 er 	 	him	a	job	 know 	 ing 	 	that	he	's	going	to	fail	.	``	but	with	najmuddin	,	we	can	not	discuss	.
so	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	i	could	manage	to	obtain	was	a	kind	of	a	 com 	 promise 	 	.
 on 	 ly 	 	one	week	--	one	week	try	and	not	a	single	day	more	.
one	week	 lat 	 er 	 	,	mahmoud	was	the	 fast 	 est 	 	in	the	production	line	.
i	told	najmuddin	,	``	that	's	a	trick	.
i	ca	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	it	.	``	the	production	was	up	20	percent	.
``	it	's	a	trick	,	it	's	a	trick	,	``	i	 s 	 aid 	 	.	and	then	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	for	 ver 	 ification 	 	.
it	was	true	.
the	comment	of	najmuddin	was	mahmoud	 ha 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	to	prove	.
i	 under 	 stood 	 	that	i	was	wrong	 aga 	 in 	 	.
mahmoud	had	 look 	 ed 	 	 tall 	 er 	 	.
i	remember	him	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	the	 work 	 bench 	 	 smil 	 ing 	 	.
he	was	a	new	man	,	 tall 	 er 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
of	course	,	i	 under 	 stood 	 	that	what	made	him	stand	tall	--	 yea 	 h 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	the	 leg 	 s 	 	,	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	--	but	 a 	 s 	 	a	first	step	,	it	was	the	dignity	.
he	 ha 	 s 	 	 regain 	 ed 	 	his	full	dignity	 thank 	 s 	 	to	that	job	.
so	of	course	,	i	 under 	 stood 	 	.
and	then	we	 start 	 ed 	 	a	new	policy	--	a	new	policy	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	.
we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	employ	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 dis 	 able 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	possible	to	train	them	in	any	possible	job	.
it	 be 	 came 	 	a	policy	of	``	positive	 discrimi 	 nation 	 	,	``	we	call	it	now	.
and	you	know	what	?
it	's	good	for	 every 	 body 	 	.
 every 	 body 	 	 benefit 	 s 	 	from	that	--	 t 	 hose 	 	 employ 	 ed 	 	,	of	course	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	get	a	job	and	dignity	.
but	 al 	 so 	 	for	the	 new 	 com 	 ers 	 	.
they	are	7,000	every	year	--	people	coming	for	the	first	time	.
and	you	should	see	the	 face 	 s 	 	of	these	people	when	they	 real 	 ize 	 	that	 t 	 hose 	 	 assist 	 ing 	 	them	are	like	them	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	you	see	them	,	they	look	,	``	oh	.	``
and	you	see	the	 face 	 s 	 	.
and	then	the	surprise	 turn 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	hope	.
and	it	's	easy	for	me	 a 	 s 	 	well	to	train	 some 	 one 	 	who	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	 pass 	 ed 	 	through	the	experience	of	 dis 	 ability 	 	.
poof	,	they	learn	much	 fast 	 er 	 	--	the	 motiv 	 ation 	 	,	the	 empath 	 y 	 	they	can	establish	with	the	patient	is	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	,	 complete 	 ly 	 	.
 scrap 	 s 	 	of	men	do	not	exist	.
people	like	mahmoud	are	 agent 	 s 	 	of	change	.
and	when	you	start	changing	,	you	can	not	stop	.
so	 employ 	 ing 	 	people	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 programm 	 ing 	 	 project 	 s 	 	of	 micro 	 finance 	 	,	education	.
and	when	you	start	,	you	can	not	stop	.
so	you	do	 voc 	 ation 	 al 	 	training	,	home	education	for	 t 	 hose 	 	who	can	not	go	to	school	.
physical	 ther 	 a 	 pies 	 	can	be	 d 	 one 	 	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	in	the	 ortho 	 pedic 	 	center	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	in	the	 house 	 s 	 	of	the	people	.
there	is	 al 	 ways 	 	a	better	way	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	.
that	's	najmuddin	,	the	one	with	the	white	coat	.
 terr 	 ible 	 	najmuddin	,	is	that	one	.
i	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	a	lot	from	people	like	najmuddin	,	mahmoud	,	rafi	.
they	are	my	 teacher 	 s 	 	.
i	have	a	wish	,	a	big	wish	,	that	 th 	 is 	 	way	of	 work 	 ing 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	way	of	 think 	 ing 	 	,	is	going	to	be	 implement 	 ed 	 	in	other	 count 	 ries 	 	.
there	are	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	 count 	 ries 	 	at	war	like	afghanistan	.
it	is	possible	and	it	is	not	difficult	.
all	we	have	to	do	is	to	listen	to	the	people	that	we	are	 suppose 	 d 	 	assist	,	to	make	them	part	of	the	decision	-	making	process	and	then	,	of	course	,	to	adapt	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	my	big	wish	.
well	do	n't	think	that	the	 change 	 s 	 	in	afghanistan	are	over	;	not	at	all	.	we	are	going	on	.
 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	we	have	just	 start 	 ed 	 	a	program	,	a	 s 	 port 	 	program	--	 basket 	 ball 	 	for	wheelchair	 user 	 s 	 	.
we	transport	the	 wheelchair 	 s 	 	 every 	 where 	 	.
we	have	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 team 	 s 	 	in	the	main	part	of	afghanistan	.
at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	when	anajulina	told	me	,	``	we	would	like	to	start	it	,	``	i	 hesit 	 ated 	 	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	``	you	can	imagine	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	no	,	no	,	no	,	we	ca	n't	.	``	and	then	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	usual	question	:	``	is	it	a	 prior 	 ity 	 	?
is	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 necess 	 ary 	 	?	``	well	now	you	should	see	me	.
i	never	 mis 	 s 	 	a	single	training	session	.
the	night	before	a	match	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	nervous	.
and	you	should	see	me	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	match	.
i	shout	like	a	true	italian	.
what	's	next	?	what	is	going	to	be	the	next	change	?
well	i	do	n't	know	yet	,	but	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	najmuddin	and	his	 friend 	 s 	 	,	they	have	it	 al 	 ready 	 	in	mind	.
that	was	my	story	.	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
