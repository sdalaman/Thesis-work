i	do	two	 thing 	 s 	 	:	i	design	mobile	 computer 	 s 	 	and	i	 stud 	 y 	 	 brain 	 s 	 	.
and	 to 	 day 	 	's	talk	is	about	 brain 	 s 	 	and	,	 ya 	 y 	 	,	 some 	 where 	 	i	have	a	brain	fan	out	there	.
i	'm	going	to	,	if	i	can	have	my	first	slide	up	here	,	and	you	'll	see	the	title	of	my	talk	and	my	two	 affili 	 ations 	 	.
so	what	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	is	why	we	do	n't	have	a	good	brain	 theor 	 y 	 	,	why	it	is	 import 	 ant 	 	that	we	should	develop	one	and	what	we	can	do	about	it	.
and	i	'll	try	to	do	all	that	in	20	 minute 	 s 	 	.	i	have	two	 affili 	 ations 	 	.
most	of	you	know	me	from	my	palm	and	handspring	 day 	 s 	 	,	but	i	 al 	 so 	 	run	a	 non 	 profit 	 	scientific	research	institute	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 red 	 wood 	 	 neuro 	 science 	 	institute	in	menlo	park	,	and	we	 stud 	 y 	 	 theoretic 	 al 	 	 neuro 	 science 	 	,	and	we	 stud 	 y 	 	how	the	 neo 	 cortex 	 	 work 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	talk	all	about	that	.
i	have	one	slide	on	my	other	life	,	the	computer	life	,	and	that	's	the	slide	here	.
these	are	some	of	the	 product 	 s 	 	i	've	 work 	 ed 	 	on	over	the	last	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	 start 	 ing 	 	back	from	the	 ver 	 y 	 	original	 lap 	 top 	 	to	some	of	the	first	 table 	 t 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	and	so	on	,	and	 end 	 ing 	 	up	most	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	with	the	treo	,	and	we	're	 continu 	 ing 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	mobile	computing	is	the	future	of	personal	computing	,	and	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	the	world	a	little	bit	better	by	 work 	 ing 	 	on	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	was	,	i	have	to	admit	,	all	an	accident	.
i	 re 	 ally 	 	did	n't	want	to	do	any	of	these	 product 	 s 	 	and	 ver 	 y 	 	early	in	my	 care 	 er 	 	i	 decide 	 d 	 	i	was	not	going	to	be	in	the	computer	industry	.
and	before	i	tell	you	about	that	,	i	just	have	to	tell	you	 th 	 is 	 	one	little	picture	of	graffiti	there	i	 pick 	 ed 	 	off	the	web	the	other	day	.
i	was	looking	for	a	picture	of	graffiti	,	little	text	 in 	 put 	 	language	,	and	i	found	the	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	 dedicate 	 d 	 	to	 teacher 	 s 	 	who	want	to	make	these	,	you	know	,	the	script	writing	 thing 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	top	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 black 	 board 	 	,	and	they	had	 add 	 ed 	 	graffiti	to	it	,	and	i	'm	sorry	about	that	.
so	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	was	,	when	i	was	young	and	got	out	of	 engineer 	 ing 	 	school	at	cornell	in	'79	,	i	 decide 	 d 	 	--	i	went	to	work	for	 in 	 tel 	 	and
i	was	in	the	computer	industry	--	and	three	 month 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	that	,	i	fell	in	love	with	 some 	 thing 	 	else	,	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	made	the	wrong	 care 	 er 	 	choice	here	,	``	and	i	fell	in	love	with	 brain 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	real	brain	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	of	one	,	a	line	 draw 	 ing 	 	.
but	i	do	n't	remember	 exact 	 ly 	 	how	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	but	i	have	one	 re 	 collect 	 ion 	 	,	which	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	strong	in	my	mind	.
in	september	1979	,	scientific	american	came	out	with	a	single	 top 	 ic 	 	issue	about	the	brain	.	and	it	was	 quit 	 e 	 	good	.
it	was	one	of	the	best	 issue 	 s 	 	ever	.	and	they	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	the	 neuro 	 n 	 	and	 develop 	 ment 	 	and	disease	and	vision	and	all	the	 thing 	 s 	 	you	might	want	to	know	about	 brain 	 s 	 	.	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 impress 	 ive 	 	.
and	one	might	have	the	impression	that	we	 re 	 ally 	 	 k 	 new 	 	a	lot	about	 brain 	 s 	 	.
but	the	last	article	in	that	issue	was	written	by	francis	crick	of	dna	fame	.
 to 	 day 	 	is	,	i	think	,	the	50th	 annivers 	 ary 	 	of	the	 discover 	 y 	 	of	dna	.
and	he	wrote	a	story	 bas 	 ically 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	well	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	well	and	good	,	but	you	know	what	,	we	do	n't	know	 didd 	 ley 	 	squat	about	 brain 	 s 	 	and	no	one	 ha 	 s 	 	a	clue	how	these	 thing 	 s 	 	work	,	so	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	what	 any 	 one 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	you	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	quote	from	that	article	.	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	is	 conspicuous 	 ly 	 	 lack 	 ing 	 	,	``	he	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	proper	british	 gentle 	 man 	 	so	,	``	what	is	 conspicuous 	 ly 	 	 lack 	 ing 	 	is	a	broad	 frame 	 work 	 	of	 idea 	 s 	 	in	which	to	interpret	these	different	 approach 	 es 	 	.	``
i	thought	the	word	 frame 	 work 	 	was	great	.
he	did	n't	say	we	did	n't	even	have	a	 theor 	 y 	 	.	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	we	do	n't	even	know	how	to	begin	to	think	about	it	--	we	do	n't	even	have	a	 frame 	 work 	 	.
we	are	in	the	pre	-	paradigm	 day 	 s 	 	,	if	you	want	to	use	thomas	kuhn	.
and	so	i	fell	in	love	with	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	 s 	 aid 	 	look	,	we	have	all	 th 	 is 	 	knowledge	about	 brain 	 s 	 	.	how	hard	can	it	be	?
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	we	can	work	on	my	 life 	 time 	 	.	i	felt	i	could	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	,	and	so	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	get	out	of	the	computer	business	,	 in 	 to 	 	the	brain	business	.
first	,	i	went	to	mit	,	the	ai	lab	was	there	,	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	well	,	i	want	to	build	intelligent	 machine 	 s 	 	,	too	,	but	the	way	i	want	to	do	it	is	to	 stud 	 y 	 	how	 brain 	 s 	 	work	first	.
and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	oh	,	you	do	n't	need	to	do	that	.
we	're	just	going	to	program	 computer 	 s 	 	;	that	's	all	we	need	to	do	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	no	,	you	 re 	 ally 	 	ought	to	 stud 	 y 	 	 brain 	 s 	 	.	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	oh	,	you	know	,	you	're	wrong	.	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	no	,	you	're	wrong	,	and	i	did	n't	get	in	.
but	i	was	a	little	 disappoint 	 ed 	 	--	 pre 	 tty 	 	young	--	but	i	went	back	 aga 	 in 	 	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	and	 th 	 is 	 	time	was	in	california	,	and	i	went	to	berkeley	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	i	'll	go	in	from	the	 bio 	 logical 	 	side	.
so	i	got	in	--	in	the	ph.d.	program	in	 bio 	 physics 	 	,	and	i	was	,	all	right	,
i	'm	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	 brain 	 s 	 	now	,	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	well	,	i	want	to	 stud 	 y 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	.
and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	oh	no	,	you	ca	n't	 stud 	 y 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	about	 brain 	 s 	 	.
that	's	not	 some 	 thing 	 	you	do	.	you	ca	n't	get	funded	for	that	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	a	graduate	student	,	you	ca	n't	do	that	.	so	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	oh	my	 go 	 sh 	 	.
i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 depress 	 ed 	 	.	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	but	i	can	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	field	.
so	what	i	did	is	i	went	back	in	the	computer	industry	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	well	,	i	'll	have	to	work	here	for	a	while	,	do	 some 	 thing 	 	.
that	's	when	i	designed	all	 t 	 hose 	 	computer	 product 	 s 	 	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	i	want	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	for	four	 year 	 s 	 	,	make	some	money	,	like	i	was	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	family	,	and	i	would	mature	a	bit	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	the	business	of	 neuro 	 science 	 	would	mature	a	bit	.
well	,	it	took	 long 	 er 	 	than	four	 year 	 s 	 	.	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	about	16	 year 	 s 	 	.
but	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	it	now	,	and	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	about	it	.
so	why	should	we	have	a	good	brain	 theor 	 y 	 	?
well	,	there	's	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 reason 	 s 	 	people	do	science	.
one	is	--	the	most	 bas 	 ic 	 	one	is	--	people	like	to	know	 thing 	 s 	 	.
we	're	 cur 	 ious 	 	,	and	we	just	go	out	and	get	knowledge	,	you	know	?
why	do	we	 stud 	 y 	 	ants	?	well	,	it	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	we	'll	learn	 some 	 thing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	about	it	,	but	it	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	and	 fasci 	 nating 	 	.
but	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	a	science	 ha 	 s 	 	some	other	 attribut 	 es 	 	which	 make 	 s 	 	it	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	a	science	will	tell	 some 	 thing 	 	about	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	it	'll	tell	us	who	we	are	.
 rare 	 ly 	 	,	you	know	:	evolution	did	 th 	 is 	 	and	copernicus	did	 th 	 is 	 	,	where	we	have	a	new	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	who	we	are	.
and	after	all	,	we	are	our	 brain 	 s 	 	.	my	brain	is	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	your	brain	.
our	bodies	are	 hang 	 ing 	 	 a 	 long 	 	for	the	ride	,	but	my	brain	is	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	your	brain	.
and	if	we	want	to	understand	who	we	are	and	how	we	feel	and	perceive	,	we	 re 	 ally 	 	understand	what	 brain 	 s 	 	are	.
 an 	 other 	 	thing	is	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	science	 lead 	 s 	 	to	 re 	 ally 	 	big	 socie 	 tal 	 	 benefit 	 s 	 	and	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	or	 business 	 es 	 	,	or	 what 	 ever 	 	,	that	come	out	of	it	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	,	too	,	 be 	 cause 	 	when	we	understand	how	 brain 	 s 	 	work	,	we	're	going	to	be	able	to	build	intelligent	 machine 	 s 	 	,	and	i	think	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	good	thing	on	the	whole	,	and	it	's	going	to	have	tremendous	 benefit 	 s 	 	to	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	just	like	a	fundamental	technology	.
so	why	do	n't	we	have	a	good	 theor 	 y 	 	of	 brain 	 s 	 	?
and	people	have	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	it	for	100	 year 	 s 	 	.
well	,	let	's	first	take	a	look	at	what	normal	science	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	normal	science	.
normal	science	is	a	nice	balance	between	 theor 	 y 	 	and	 experiment 	 alist 	 s 	 	.
and	so	the	 theor 	 ist 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	say	,	well	,	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	's	going	on	,	and	the	 experiment 	 alist 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	no	,	you	're	wrong	.
and	it	 go 	 es 	 	back	and	forth	,	you	know	?
 th 	 is 	 	 work 	 s 	 	in	physics	.	 th 	 is 	 	 work 	 s 	 	in	 geo 	 logy 	 	.	but	if	 th 	 is 	 	is	normal	science	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	 neuro 	 science 	 	look	like	?	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 neuro 	 science 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
we	have	 th 	 is 	 	mountain	of	data	,	which	is	anatomy	,	physiology	and	behavior	.
you	ca	n't	imagine	how	much	detail	we	know	about	 brain 	 s 	 	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	28,000	people	who	went	to	the	 neuro 	 science 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	,	and	every	one	of	them	is	 do 	 ing 	 	research	in	 brain 	 s 	 	.
a	lot	of	data	.	but	there	's	no	 theor 	 y 	 	.	there	's	a	little	,	 wimp 	 y 	 	box	on	top	there	.
and	 theor 	 y 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 play 	 ed 	 	a	role	in	any	sort	of	grand	way	in	the	 neuro 	 science 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	a	real	shame	.	now	why	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	come	about	?
if	you	ask	 neuro 	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	why	is	 th 	 is 	 	the	state	of	 af 	 fair 	 	,	they	'll	first	of	all	admit	it	.	but	if	you	ask	them	,	they	'll	say	,	well	,	there	's	 vari 	 ous 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	we	do	n't	have	a	good	brain	 theor 	 y 	 	.
some	people	say	,	well	,	we	do	n't	still	have	 en 	 ough 	 	data	,	we	need	to	get	more	information	,	there	's	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	we	do	n't	know	.
well	,	i	just	told	you	there	's	so	much	data	coming	out	your	 ear 	 s 	 	.
we	have	so	much	information	,	we	do	n't	even	know	how	to	begin	to	organize	it	.
what	good	is	more	going	to	do	?
 may 	 be 	 	we	'll	be	 luck 	 y 	 	and	discover	some	magic	thing	,	but	i	do	n't	think	so	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	symptom	of	the	fact	that	we	just	do	n't	have	a	 theor 	 y 	 	.
we	do	n't	need	more	data	--	we	need	a	good	 theor 	 y 	 	about	it	.
 an 	 other 	 	one	is	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	people	say	,	well	,	 brain 	 s 	 	are	so	complex	,	it	'll	take	 an 	 other 	 	50	 year 	 s 	 	.
i	even	think	chris	 s 	 aid 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	 yester 	 day 	 	.
i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	what	you	 s 	 aid 	 	,	chris	,	but	 some 	 thing 	 	like	,	well	,	it	's	one	of	the	most	 complic 	 ated 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.	that	's	not	true	.
you	're	more	 complic 	 ated 	 	than	your	brain	.	you	've	got	a	brain	.
and	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	the	brain	 look 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	look	 complic 	 ated 	 	 un 	 til 	 	you	understand	them	.
that	's	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	the	case	.	and	so	all	we	can	say	,	well	,	my	 neo 	 cortex 	 	,	which	is	the	part	of	the	brain	i	'm	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	,	 ha 	 s 	 	30	billion	 cell 	 s 	 	.
but	,	you	know	what	?	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	regular	.
in	fact	,	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	it	's	the	same	thing	 repeat 	 ed 	 	over	and	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	.
it	's	not	 a 	 s 	 	complex	 a 	 s 	 	it	 look 	 s 	 	.	that	's	not	the	issue	.
some	people	say	,	 brain 	 s 	 	ca	n't	understand	 brain 	 s 	 	.
 ver 	 y 	 	zen	-	like	.	whoo	.
you	know	,	it	 sound 	 s 	 	good	,	but	why	?	i	mean	,	what	's	the	point	?
it	's	just	a	bunch	of	 cell 	 s 	 	.	you	understand	your	liver	.
it	's	got	a	lot	of	 cell 	 s 	 	in	it	too	,	right	?
so	,	you	know	,	i	do	n't	think	there	's	 any 	 thing 	 	to	that	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	some	people	say	,	well	,	you	know	,	i	do	n't	feel	like	a	bunch	of	 cell 	 s 	 	,	you	know	.	i	'm	conscious	.
i	've	got	 th 	 is 	 	experience	,	i	'm	in	the	world	,	you	know	.
i	ca	n't	be	just	a	bunch	of	 cell 	 s 	 	.	well	,	you	know	,
people	used	to	 believ 	 e 	 	there	was	a	life	force	to	be	living	,	and	we	now	know	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	not	true	at	all	.
and	there	's	 re 	 ally 	 	no	evidence	that	 say 	 s 	 	--	well	,	other	than	people	just	have	 dis 	 belief 	 	that	 cell 	 s 	 	can	do	what	they	do	.
and	so	,	if	some	people	have	 fall 	 en 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	pit	of	 meta 	 physical 	 	 dual 	 ism 	 	,	some	 re 	 ally 	 	smart	people	,	too	,	but	we	can	reject	all	that	.
no	,	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	else	,	and	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	fundamental	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	is	:	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	reason	why	we	do	n't	have	a	good	brain	 theor 	 y 	 	,	and	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	an	intuitive	,	 strong 	 ly 	 	-	held	,	but	 in 	 correct 	 	assumption	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 prevent 	 ed 	 	us	from	 see 	 ing 	 	the	answer	.
there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	we	 believ 	 e 	 	that	just	,	it	's	obvious	,	but	it	's	wrong	.
now	,	there	's	a	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	in	science	and	before	i	tell	you	what	it	is	,	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	a	bit	about	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	it	in	science	.
you	look	at	some	other	scientific	 revolution 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	solar	system	,	that	's	copernicus	,	darwin	's	evolution	,	and	tectonic	 plate 	 s 	 	,	that	's	wegener	.
they	all	have	a	lot	in	common	with	brain	science	.
first	of	all	,	they	had	a	lot	of	 un 	 explain 	 ed 	 	data	.	a	lot	of	it	.
but	it	got	more	 manage 	 able 	 	once	they	had	a	 theor 	 y 	 	.
the	best	 mind 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 stump 	 ed 	 	--	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	smart	people	.
we	're	not	 smart 	 er 	 	now	than	they	 we 	 re 	 	then	.
it	just	 turn 	 s 	 	out	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	to	think	of	 thing 	 s 	 	,	but	once	you	've	thought	of	them	,	it	's	kind	of	easy	to	understand	it	.
my	 daughter 	 s 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	these	three	 the 	 ories 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 bas 	 ic 	 	 frame 	 work 	 	by	the	time	they	 we 	 re 	 	in	 kind 	 ergarten 	 	.
and	now	it	's	not	that	hard	,	you	know	,	here	's	the	apple	,	here	's	the	 o 	 range 	 	,	you	know	,	the	earth	 go 	 es 	 	around	,	that	kind	of	stuff	.
 final 	 ly 	 	,	 an 	 other 	 	thing	is	the	answer	was	there	all	 a 	 long 	 	,	but	we	kind	of	 ignor 	 ed 	 	it	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	obvious	thing	,	and	that	's	the	thing	.
it	was	an	intuitive	,	strong	-	held	belief	that	was	wrong	.
in	the	case	of	the	solar	system	,	the	idea	that	the	earth	is	 s 	 pinning 	 	and	the	surface	of	the	earth	is	going	like	a	thousand	 mile 	 s 	 	an	hour	,	and	the	earth	is	going	through	the	solar	system	about	a	million	 mile 	 s 	 	an	hour	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 lun 	 acy 	 	.	we	all	know	the	earth	is	n't	moving	.
do	you	feel	like	you	're	moving	a	thousand	 mile 	 s 	 	an	hour	?
of	course	not	.	you	know	,	and	 some 	 one 	 	who	 s 	 aid 	 	,	well	,	it	was	 s 	 pinning 	 	around	in	space	and	it	's	so	huge	,	they	would	lock	you	up	,	and	that	's	what	they	did	back	then	.
so	it	was	intuitive	and	obvious	.	now	what	about	evolution	?
evolution	's	the	same	thing	.	we	taught	our	 kid 	 s 	 	,	well	,	the	 b 	 ible 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	god	 create 	 d 	 	all	these	species	,	 cat 	 s 	 	are	 cat 	 s 	 	,	 dog 	 s 	 	are	 dog 	 s 	 	,	people	are	people	,	 plant 	 s 	 	are	 plant 	 s 	 	,	they	do	n't	change	.
noah	put	them	on	the	ark	in	that	order	,	 bl 	 ah 	 	,	 bl 	 ah 	 	,	 bl 	 ah 	 	.	and	,	you	know	,
the	fact	is	,	if	you	 believ 	 e 	 	in	evolution	,	we	all	have	a	common	 ance 	 s 	 tor 	 	,	and	we	all	have	a	common	 ance 	 stry 	 	with	the	plant	in	the	lobby	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	evolution	 tell 	 s 	 	us	.	and	,	it	's	true	.	it	's	kind	of	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	.
and	the	same	thing	about	tectonic	 plate 	 s 	 	,	you	know	?
all	the	 mountain 	 s 	 	and	the	 continent 	 s 	 	are	kind	of	 float 	 ing 	 	around	on	top	of	the	earth	,	you	know	?	it	's	like	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	any	sense	.
so	what	is	the	intuitive	,	but	 in 	 correct 	 	assumption	,	that	's	 ke 	 pt 	 	us	from	 understand 	 ing 	 	 brain 	 s 	 	?
now	i	'm	going	to	tell	it	to	you	,	and	it	's	going	to	seem	obvious	that	that	is	correct	,	and	that	's	the	point	,	right	?	then	i	'm	going	to	have	to	make	an	argument	why	you	're	 in 	 correct 	 	about	the	other	assumption	.
the	intuitive	but	obvious	thing	is	that	 some 	 how 	 	 intellig 	 ence 	 	is	defined	by	behavior	,	that	we	are	intelligent	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	way	that	we	do	 thing 	 s 	 	and	the	way	we	 behav 	 e 	 	 intelligent 	 ly 	 	,	and	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	that	's	wrong	.
what	it	is	is	 intellig 	 ence 	 	is	defined	by	 predict 	 ion 	 	.
and	i	'm	going	to	work	you	through	 th 	 is 	 	in	a	few	 slide 	 s 	 	here	,	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	what	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	.	here	's	a	system	.
 engineer 	 s 	 	like	to	look	at	 system 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.	 scientist 	 s 	 	like	to	look	at	 system 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
they	say	,	well	,	we	have	a	thing	in	a	box	,	and	we	have	 it 	 s 	 	 in 	 put 	 s 	 	and	 it 	 s 	 	 out 	 put 	 s 	 	.
the	ai	people	 s 	 aid 	 	,	well	,	the	thing	in	the	box	is	a	 programm 	 able 	 	computer	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	 equi 	 valent 	 	to	a	brain	,	and	we	'll	feed	it	some	 in 	 put 	 s 	 	and	we	'll	get	it	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	,	have	some	behavior	.
and	alan	turing	defined	the	turing	test	,	which	is	 essential 	 ly 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	we	'll	know	if	 some 	 thing 	 	's	intelligent	if	it	 behav 	 es 	 	 ident 	 ical 	 	to	a	human	.
a	 behavior 	 al 	 	metric	of	what	 intellig 	 ence 	 	is	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 tuck 	 	in	our	 mind 	 s 	 	for	a	long	period	of	time	.
 re 	 ality 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	,	i	call	it	real	 intellig 	 ence 	 	.
real	 intellig 	 ence 	 	is	built	on	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
we	experience	the	world	through	a	sequence	of	 pattern 	 s 	 	,	and	we	store	them	,	and	we	recall	them	.	and	when	we	recall	them	,	we	match	them	up	against	 re 	 ality 	 	,	and	we	're	making	 predict 	 ions 	 	all	the	time	.
it	's	an	 e 	 ternal 	 	metric	.	there	's	an	 e 	 ternal 	 	metric	about	us	sort	of	 say 	 ing 	 	,	do	we	understand	the	world	?	am	i	making	 predict 	 ions 	 	?	and	so	on	.
you	're	all	 be 	 ing 	 	intelligent	right	now	,	but	you	're	not	 do 	 ing 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	you	're	 scratch 	 ing 	 	 your 	 self 	 	,	or	 pick 	 ing 	 	your	nose	,	i	do	n't	know	,	but	you	're	not	 do 	 ing 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	right	now	,	but	you	're	 be 	 ing 	 	intelligent	;	you	're	 understand 	 ing 	 	what	i	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	intelligent	and	you	speak	english	,	you	know	what	word	is	at	the	end	of	 th 	 is 	 	--
sentence	.
the	word	came	 in 	 to 	 	you	,	and	you	're	making	these	 predict 	 ions 	 	all	the	time	.
and	then	,	what	i	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	is	,	is	that	the	 e 	 ternal 	 	 predict 	 ion 	 	is	the	 out 	 put 	 	in	the	 neo 	 cortex 	 	.
and	that	 some 	 how 	 	,	 predict 	 ion 	 	 lead 	 s 	 	to	intelligent	behavior	.
and	here	's	how	that	 happen 	 s 	 	.	let	's	start	with	a	non	-	intelligent	brain	.
well	i	'll	 argu 	 e 	 	a	non	-	intelligent	brain	,	we	got	hold	of	an	old	brain	,	and	we	're	going	to	say	it	's	like	a	non	-	mammal	,	like	a	 reptil 	 e 	 	,	so	i	'll	say	,	an	 all 	 igator 	 	;	we	have	an	 all 	 igator 	 	.
and	the	 all 	 igator 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	some	 ver 	 y 	 	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	 sense 	 s 	 	.
it	's	got	good	 eye 	 s 	 	and	 ear 	 s 	 	and	touch	 sense 	 s 	 	and	so	on	,	a	mouth	and	a	nose	.	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	complex	behavior	.
it	can	run	and	hide	.	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 fear 	 s 	 	and	 emotion 	 s 	 	.	it	can	eat	you	,	you	know	.
it	can	attack	.	it	can	do	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	stuff	.
but	we	do	n't	consider	the	 all 	 igator 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	intelligent	,	not	like	in	a	human	sort	of	way	.
but	it	 ha 	 s 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	complex	behavior	 al 	 ready 	 	.
now	,	in	evolution	,	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	?
first	thing	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	evolution	with	 mammal 	 s 	 	,	we	 start 	 ed 	 	to	develop	a	thing	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 neo 	 cortex 	 	.
and	i	'm	going	to	represent	the	 neo 	 cortex 	 	here	,	by	 th 	 is 	 	box	that	's	 stick 	 ing 	 	on	top	of	the	old	brain	.
 neo 	 cortex 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	new	layer	.	it	is	a	new	layer	on	top	of	your	brain	.
if	you	do	n't	know	it	,	it	's	the	 wrinkl 	 y 	 	thing	on	the	top	of	your	head	that	,	it	's	got	 wrinkl 	 y 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	got	 shove 	 d 	 	in	there	and	 do 	 es 	 	n't	fit	.
no	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	that	's	what	it	is	.	it	's	about	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	table	napkin	.
and	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	fit	,	so	it	 get 	 s 	 	all	 wrinkl 	 y 	 	.	now	look	at	how	i	've	drawn	 th 	 is 	 	here	.
the	old	brain	is	still	there	.	you	still	have	that	 all 	 igator 	 	brain	.
you	do	.	it	's	your	 emotion 	 al 	 	brain	.
it	's	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	all	 t 	 hose 	 	gut	 react 	 ions 	 	you	have	.
and	on	top	of	it	,	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	 memor 	 y 	 	system	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 neo 	 cortex 	 	.
and	the	 memor 	 y 	 	system	is	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	over	the	 sensor 	 y 	 	part	of	the	brain	.
and	so	 a 	 s 	 	the	 sensor 	 y 	 	 in 	 put 	 	 come 	 s 	 	in	and	 feed 	 s 	 	from	the	old	brain	,	it	 al 	 so 	 	 go 	 es 	 	up	 in 	 to 	 	the	 neo 	 cortex 	 	.	and	the	 neo 	 cortex 	 	is	just	 memor 	 izing 	 	.
it	's	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	 say 	 ing 	 	,	ah	,	i	'm	going	to	 memor 	 ize 	 	all	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	going	on	:	where	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	,	people	i	've	 s 	 een 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	i	've	heard	,	and	so	on	.
and	in	the	future	,	when	it	 s 	 ees 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	similar	to	that	 aga 	 in 	 	,	so	in	a	similar	environment	,	or	the	exact	same	environment	,	it	'll	play	it	back	.	it	'll	start	 play 	 ing 	 	it	back	.
oh	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	here	before	.	and	when	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	here	before	,	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	next	.	it	 allow 	 s 	 	you	to	predict	the	future	.
it	 allow 	 s 	 	you	to	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	it	 feed 	 s 	 	back	the	 signal 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	your	brain	;	they	'll	let	you	see	what	's	going	to	happen	next	,	will	let	you	hear	the	word	``	sentence	``	before	i	 s 	 aid 	 	it	.
and	it	's	 th 	 is 	 	 feed 	 ing 	 	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	old	brain	that	'll	allow	you	to	make	 ver 	 y 	 	more	intelligent	 decision 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	slide	of	my	talk	,	so	i	'll	 d 	 well 	 	on	it	a	little	bit	.
and	so	,	all	the	time	you	say	,	oh	,	i	can	predict	the	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	if	you	're	a	rat	and	you	go	through	a	maze	,	and	then	you	learn	the	maze	,	the	next	time	you	're	in	a	maze	,	you	have	the	same	behavior	,	but	all	of	a	sudden	,	you	're	 smart 	 er 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	you	say	,	oh	,	i	 recogn 	 ize 	 	 th 	 is 	 	maze	,	i	know	which	way	to	go	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	here	before	,	i	can	envision	the	future	.	and	that	's	what	it	's	 do 	 ing 	 	.
in	 human 	 s 	 	--	by	the	way	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	true	for	all	 mammal 	 s 	 	;
it	's	true	for	other	 mammal 	 s 	 	--	and	in	 human 	 s 	 	,	it	got	a	lot	 wo 	 rse 	 	.
in	 human 	 s 	 	,	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	the	front	part	of	the	 neo 	 cortex 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 an 	 terior 	 	part	of	the	 neo 	 cortex 	 	.	and	nature	did	a	little	trick	.
it	 cop 	 ied 	 	the	 po 	 s 	 terior 	 	part	,	the	back	part	,	which	is	 sensor 	 y 	 	,	and	put	it	in	the	front	part	.
and	 human 	 s 	 	 un 	 ique 	 ly 	 	have	the	same	 mechan 	 ism 	 	on	the	front	,	but	we	use	it	for	motor	control	.
so	we	are	now	able	to	make	 ver 	 y 	 	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	motor	 plan 	 ning 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	.
i	do	n't	have	time	to	get	 in 	 to 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	if	you	want	to	understand	how	a	brain	 work 	 s 	 	,	you	have	to	understand	how	the	first	part	of	the	 mammal 	 ian 	 	 neo 	 cortex 	 	 work 	 s 	 	,	how	it	is	we	store	 pattern 	 s 	 	and	make	 predict 	 ions 	 	.
so	let	me	give	you	a	few	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	 predict 	 ions 	 	.
i	 al 	 ready 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	the	word	``	sentence	.	``	in	music	,	if	you	've	heard	a	song	before	,	if	you	heard	jill	 s 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 song 	 s 	 	before	,	when	she	 s 	 ing 	 s 	 	them	,	the	next	note	 pop 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	your	head	 al 	 ready 	 	--	you	 anticip 	 ate 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	you	're	going	.	if	it	was	an	 al 	 bum 	 	of	music	,	the	end	of	one	 al 	 bum 	 	,	the	next	song	 pop 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	your	head	.
and	these	 thing 	 s 	 	happen	all	the	time	.	you	're	making	these	 predict 	 ions 	 	.
i	have	 th 	 is 	 	thing	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 alter 	 ed 	 	door	thought	experiment	.	and	the	 alter 	 ed 	 	door	thought	experiment	 say 	 s 	 	,	you	have	a	door	at	home	,	and	when	you	're	here	,	i	'm	changing	it	,	i	've	got	a	guy	back	at	your	house	right	now	,	moving	the	door	around	,	and	they	're	going	to	take	your	 door 	 knob 	 	and	move	it	over	two	 inch 	 es 	 	.
and	when	you	go	home	 to 	 night 	 	,	you	're	going	to	put	your	hand	out	there	,	and	you	're	going	to	reach	for	the	 door 	 knob 	 	and	you	're	going	to	notice	it	's	in	the	wrong	spot	,	and	you	'll	go	,	 who 	 a 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
it	may	take	a	second	to	figure	out	what	it	was	,	but	 some 	 thing 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
now	i	could	change	your	 door 	 knob 	 	in	other	ways	.
i	can	make	it	 large 	 r 	 	or	 small 	 er 	 	,	i	can	change	 it 	 s 	 	 bra 	 s 	 s 	 	to	silver	,	i	could	make	it	a	lever	.	i	can	change	your	door	,	put	 color 	 s 	 	on	;	i	can	put	 window 	 s 	 	in	.	i	can	change	a	thousand	 thing 	 s 	 	about	your	door	,	and	in	the	two	 second 	 s 	 	you	take	to	open	your	door	,	you	're	going	to	notice	that	 some 	 thing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	.
now	,	the	 engineer 	 ing 	 	approach	to	 th 	 is 	 	,	the	ai	approach	to	 th 	 is 	 	,	is	to	build	a	door	 data 	 base 	 	.	it	 ha 	 s 	 	all	the	door	 attribut 	 es 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	go	up	to	the	door	,	you	know	,	let	's	check	them	off	one	at	time	.
door	,	door	,	door	,	you	know	,	color	,	you	know	what	i	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	.
we	do	n't	do	that	.	your	brain	 do 	 es 	 	n't	do	that	.
what	your	brain	is	 do 	 ing 	 	is	making	constant	 predict 	 ions 	 	all	the	time	about	what	is	going	to	happen	in	your	environment	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	put	my	hand	on	 th 	 is 	 	table	,	i	expect	to	feel	it	stop	.
when	i	walk	,	every	step	,	if	i	 mis 	 s 	 ed 	 	it	by	an	eighth	of	an	inch	,	i	'll	know	 some 	 thing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	.
you	're	 constant 	 ly 	 	making	 predict 	 ions 	 	about	your	environment	.
i	'll	talk	about	vision	here	 brief 	 ly 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	of	a	woman	.
and	when	you	look	at	people	,	your	 eye 	 s 	 	are	caught	over	at	two	to	three	 time 	 s 	 	a	second	.
you	're	not	aware	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	your	 eye 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 ways 	 	moving	.
and	so	when	you	look	at	 some 	 one 	 	's	face	,	you	'd	 typical 	 ly 	 	go	from	eye	to	eye	to	eye	to	nose	to	mouth	.
now	,	when	your	eye	 move 	 s 	 	from	eye	to	eye	,	if	there	was	 some 	 thing 	 	else	there	like	,	a	nose	,	you	'd	see	a	nose	where	an	eye	is	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	,	and	you	'd	go	,	oh	shit	,	you	know	--
there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	wrong	about	 th 	 is 	 	person	.
and	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	making	a	 predict 	 ion 	 	.
it	's	not	like	you	just	look	over	there	and	say	,	what	am	i	 see 	 ing 	 	now	?
a	nose	,	that	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	no	,	you	have	an	 expect 	 ation 	 	of	what	you	're	going	to	see	.
every	single	moment	.	and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	let	's	think	about	how	we	test	 intellig 	 ence 	 	.
we	test	it	by	 predict 	 ion 	 	.	what	is	the	next	word	in	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	know	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	to	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	to	 th 	 is 	 	.	what	is	the	next	number	in	 th 	 is 	 	sentence	?
here	's	three	 vision 	 s 	 	of	an	object	.
what	's	the	fourth	one	?	that	's	how	we	test	it	.	it	's	all	about	 predict 	 ion 	 	.
so	what	is	the	recipe	for	brain	 theor 	 y 	 	?
first	of	all	,	we	have	to	have	the	right	 frame 	 work 	 	.
and	the	 frame 	 work 	 	is	a	 memor 	 y 	 	 frame 	 work 	 	,	not	a	computation	or	behavior	 frame 	 work 	 	.	it	's	a	 memor 	 y 	 	 frame 	 work 	 	.
how	do	you	store	and	recall	these	 sequence 	 s 	 	or	 pattern 	 s 	 	?	it	's	spatio	-	temporal	 pattern 	 s 	 	.
then	,	if	in	that	 frame 	 work 	 	,	you	take	a	bunch	of	 theoretic 	 ians 	 	.
now	 biologist 	 s 	 	 general 	 ly 	 	are	not	good	 theoretic 	 ians 	 	.
it	's	not	 al 	 ways 	 	true	,	but	in	general	,	there	's	not	a	good	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 theor 	 y 	 	in	biology	.
so	i	found	the	best	people	to	work	with	are	 physicist 	 s 	 	,	 engineer 	 s 	 	and	 mathematic 	 ians 	 	,	who	tend	to	think	 algorithm 	 ically 	 	.
then	they	have	to	learn	the	anatomy	,	and	they	've	got	to	learn	the	physiology	.
you	have	to	make	these	 the 	 ories 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	realistic	in	 an 	 atomic 	 al 	 	 term 	 s 	 	.
 any 	 one 	 	who	 get 	 s 	 	up	and	 tell 	 s 	 	you	 the 	 ir 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	about	how	the	brain	 work 	 s 	 	and	 do 	 es 	 	n't	tell	you	 exact 	 ly 	 	how	it	's	 work 	 ing 	 	in	the	brain	and	how	the	wiring	 work 	 s 	 	in	the	brain	,	it	is	not	a	 theor 	 y 	 	.
and	that	's	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	at	the	 red 	 wood 	 	 neuro 	 science 	 	institute	.
i	would	love	to	have	more	time	to	tell	you	we	're	making	fantastic	progress	in	 th 	 is 	 	thing	,	and	i	expect	to	be	back	up	on	 th 	 is 	 	stage	,	 may 	 be 	 	 th 	 is 	 	will	be	some	other	time	in	the	not	too	 di 	 stant 	 	future	and	tell	you	about	it	.
i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	going	to	take	50	 year 	 s 	 	at	all	.
so	what	will	brain	 theor 	 y 	 	look	like	?
first	of	all	,	it	's	going	to	be	a	 theor 	 y 	 	about	 memor 	 y 	 	.
not	like	computer	 memor 	 y 	 	.	it	's	not	at	all	like	computer	 memor 	 y 	 	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	different	.	and	it	's	a	 memor 	 y 	 	of	these	 ver 	 y 	 	high	-	dimensional	 pattern 	 s 	 	,	like	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	come	from	your	 eye 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 memor 	 y 	 	of	 sequence 	 s 	 	.
you	can	not	learn	or	recall	 any 	 thing 	 	 out 	 side 	 	of	a	sequence	.
a	song	must	be	heard	in	sequence	over	time	,	and	you	must	play	it	back	in	sequence	over	time	.
and	these	 sequence 	 s 	 	are	auto	-	associatively	 recall 	 ed 	 	,	so	if	i	see	 some 	 thing 	 	,	i	hear	 some 	 thing 	 	,	it	 re 	 mind 	 s 	 	me	of	it	,	and	then	it	 play 	 s 	 	back	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	.
it	's	an	 autom 	 atic 	 	 play 	 back 	 	.	and	 predict 	 ion 	 	of	future	 in 	 put 	 s 	 	is	the	 desir 	 ed 	 	 out 	 put 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	the	 theor 	 y 	 	must	be	 bio 	 logically 	 	accurate	,	it	must	be	 test 	 able 	 	,	and	you	must	be	able	to	build	it	.
if	you	do	n't	build	it	,	you	do	n't	understand	it	.	so	,	one	more	slide	here	.
what	is	 th 	 is 	 	going	to	result	in	?	are	we	going	to	 re 	 ally 	 	build	intelligent	 machine 	 s 	 	?
 absolute 	 ly 	 	.	and	it	's	going	to	be	different	than	people	think	.
no	doubt	that	it	's	going	to	happen	,	in	my	mind	.
first	of	all	,	it	's	going	to	be	built	up	,	we	're	going	to	build	the	stuff	out	of	silicon	.
the	same	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	we	use	for	building	silicon	computer	 memor 	 ies 	 	,	we	can	use	for	here	.
but	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	different	 type 	 s 	 	of	 memor 	 ies 	 	.
and	we	're	going	to	attach	these	 memor 	 ies 	 	to	 sensor 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 sensor 	 s 	 	will	experience	real	-	live	,	real	-	world	data	,	and	these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	going	to	learn	about	 the 	 ir 	 	environment	.
now	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 like 	 ly 	 	the	first	 thing 	 s 	 	you	're	going	to	see	are	like	 robot 	 s 	 	.
not	that	 robot 	 s 	 	are	n't	 use 	 ful 	 	and	people	can	build	 robot 	 s 	 	.
but	the	 robotic 	 s 	 	part	is	the	 hard 	 est 	 	part	.	that	's	the	old	brain	.	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	.
the	new	brain	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	kind	of	 eas 	 ier 	 	than	the	old	brain	.
so	the	first	thing	we	're	going	to	do	are	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	do	n't	 requir 	 e 	 	a	lot	of	 robotic 	 s 	 	.
so	you	're	not	going	to	see	c	-	3po	.
you	're	going	to	more	see	 thing 	 s 	 	like	,	you	know	,	intelligent	 car 	 s 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	understand	what	traffic	is	and	what	 driv 	 ing 	 	is	and	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	certain	 type 	 s 	 	of	 car 	 s 	 	with	the	 blink 	 ers 	 	on	for	half	a	minute	 prob 	 ably 	 	are	n't	going	to	turn	,	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	.
we	can	 al 	 so 	 	do	intelligent	security	 system 	 s 	 	.
 any 	 where 	 	where	we	're	 bas 	 ically 	 	using	our	brain	,	but	not	 do 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	 mechanic 	 s 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	going	to	happen	first	.
but	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	the	world	's	the	limit	here	.
i	do	n't	know	how	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	turn	out	.
i	know	a	lot	of	people	who	 invent 	 ed 	 	the	 micro 	 processor 	 	and	if	you	talk	to	them	,	they	 k 	 new 	 	what	they	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	was	 re 	 ally 	 	significant	,	but	they	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	know	what	was	going	to	happen	.
they	could	n't	 anticip 	 ate 	 	cell	 phone 	 s 	 	and	the	 inter 	 net 	 	and	all	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	stuff	.
they	just	 k 	 new 	 	like	,	 he 	 y 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	build	 calcul 	 ators 	 	and	traffic	light	 controll 	 ers 	 	.	but	it	's	going	to	be	big	.
in	the	same	way	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	like	brain	science	and	these	 memor 	 ies 	 	are	going	to	be	a	 ver 	 y 	 	fundamental	technology	,	and	it	's	going	to	lead	to	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	 change 	 s 	 	in	the	next	100	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'm	most	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	how	we	're	going	to	use	them	in	science	.
so	i	think	that	's	all	my	time	,	i	'm	over	it	,	and	i	'm	going	to	end	my	talk	right	there	.
