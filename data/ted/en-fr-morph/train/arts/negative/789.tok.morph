i	 on 	 ly 	 	have	three	 minute 	 s 	 	so	i	'm	going	to	have	to	talk	fast	,	and	it	will	use	up	your	spare	mental	 cycle 	 s 	 	,	so	 multi 	 task 	 ing 	 	may	be	hard	.
so	,	27	 year 	 s 	 	ago	i	got	a	traffic	ticket	that	got	me	 think 	 ing 	 	.
i	've	had	some	time	to	think	it	over	.
and	energy	efficiency	is	more	than	just	about	the	vehicle	--
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	about	the	road	.
road	design	 make 	 s 	 	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 intersect 	 ions 	 	,	of	which	there	are	two	 type 	 s 	 	:	 signal 	 ized 	 	and	 un 	 signal 	 ized 	 	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	stop	 sign 	 s 	 	.
fifty	percent	of	 crash 	 es 	 	happen	at	 intersect 	 ions 	 	.
 round 	 about 	 s 	 	are	much	better	.
a	 stud 	 y 	 	of	24	 intersect 	 ions 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	found	 crash 	 es 	 	drop	40	percent	from	when	you	convert	a	traffic	light	 in 	 to 	 	a	 round 	 about 	 	.
 in 	 jury 	 	 crash 	 es 	 	have	 drop 	 ped 	 	76	percent	,
fatal	 crash 	 es 	 	down	90	percent	.
but	that	's	just	 safe 	 ty 	 	.
what	about	time	and	gas	?
so	,	traffic	 keep 	 s 	 	 flow 	 ing 	 	,	so	that	 mean 	 s 	 	less	 bra 	 king 	 	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	less	 accele 	 rating 	 	,	less	gas	and	less	 poll 	 ution 	 	,	less	time	 waste 	 d 	 	,	and	that	 part 	 ly 	 	 account 	 s 	 	for	europe	's	better	efficiency	than	we	have	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
so	,	 un 	 signal 	 ized 	 	 intersect 	 ions 	 	,	meaning	stop	 sign 	 s 	 	,	they	 s 	 ave 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 live 	 s 	 	,	but	there	's	an	 excess 	 ive 	 	 pro 	 life 	 ration 	 	of	them	.
small	 round 	 about 	 s 	 	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	appear	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	in	my	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	.	and	they	are	much	better	--	better	than	traffic	 light 	 s 	 	,	better	than	four	-	way	stop	 sign 	 s 	 	.
they	're	expensive	to	install	,	but	they	are	more	expensive	not	to	.	so	,	we	should	look	at	that	.
but	they	are	not	 appli 	 cable 	 	in	all	 situ 	 ations 	 	.
so	,	take	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	the	three	-	way	 intersect 	 ion 	 	.
so	,	it	's	logical	that	you	'd	have	one	there	,	on	the	minor	road	 enter 	 ing 	 	the	major	.
but	the	other	two	are	 some 	 what 	 	 question 	 able 	 	.
so	,	here	's	one	.	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	one	which	i	 stud 	 ied 	 	.
 car 	 s 	 	 rare 	 ly 	 	appear	on	that	third	road	.
and	so	,	the	question	is	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	that	cost	us	?
that	 intersect 	 ion 	 	i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	had	about	3,000	 car 	 s 	 	per	day	in	each	direction	,	and	so	that	's	two	 ounce 	 s 	 	of	gas	to	 accele 	 rate 	 	out	of	.
that	's	five	 cent 	 s 	 	each	,	and	 time 	 s 	 	3,000	 car 	 s 	 	per	day	,	that	's	$	51,000	per	year	.
that	's	just	the	 gas 	 o 	 line 	 	cost	.	there	is	 al 	 so 	 	 poll 	 ution 	 	,	wear	on	the	car	,	and	time	.
what	's	that	time	worth	?
well	,	at	10	 second 	 s 	 	per	3,000	 car 	 s 	 	,	that	's	8.3	 hour 	 s 	 	per	day	.	the	average	wage	in	the	u.s.	is	$	20	an	hour	.	that	is	60,000	per	year	.
add	that	together	with	the	gas	,	and	it	's	$	112,000	per	year	,	just	for	that	sign	in	each	direction	.
 dis 	 count 	 	that	back	to	the	present	,	at	five	percent	:	over	two	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	for	a	stop	sign	,	in	each	direction	.
now	,	if	you	look	at	what	that	 ad 	 ja 	 cent 	 	 proper 	 ty 	 	is	worth	,	you	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	buy	the	 proper 	 ty 	 	,	cut	down	the	 shrub 	 ber 	 y 	 	to	improve	the	sight	line	,	and	then	sell	it	off	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	you	'd	still	come	out	 a 	 head 	 	.
so	,	it	 make 	 s 	 	one	wonder	,	``	why	is	it	there	?	``
i	mean	,	why	is	there	that	stop	sign	in	each	direction	?
 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	saving	 live 	 s 	 	.	so	,	is	there	a	better	way	to	accomplish	that	goal	?
the	answer	is	to	 en 	 able 	 	 car 	 s 	 	to	come	in	from	that	side	road	 safe 	 ly 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	there	are	a	lot	of	people	who	might	live	up	there	and	if	they	're	 wait 	 ing 	 	 fore 	 ver 	 	a	long	queue	could	form	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 car 	 s 	 	are	n't	 s 	 low 	 ing 	 	down	on	the	main	road	.
can	that	be	 accomplish 	 ed 	 	with	 exist 	 ing 	 	 sign 	 s 	 	?
so	,	there	is	a	long	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	stop	 sign 	 s 	 	and	yield	 sign 	 s 	 	.
stop	 sign 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 invent 	 ed 	 	in	1915	,
yield	 sign 	 s 	 	in	1950	.	but	that	's	all	we	got	.
so	,	why	not	use	a	yield	sign	?
well	the	meaning	of	yield	is	:	you	must	yield	the	right	-	of	-	way	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	if	there	are	five	 car 	 s 	 	 wait 	 ing 	 	,	you	have	to	wait	till	they	all	go	,	then	you	go	.	it	 lack 	 s 	 	the	 not 	 ion 	 
of	 alter 	 nating 	 	,	or	taking	 turn 	 s 	 	,
and	it	's	 al 	 ways 	 	on	the	minor	road	,	 allow 	 ing 	 	the	major	one	to	have	 prim 	 acy 	 	.
so	,	it	's	hard	to	create	a	new	meaning	for	the	 exist 	 ing 	 	sign	.
you	could	n't	 sudden 	 ly 	 	tell	 every 	 one 	 	,	``	ok	,	remember	what	you	used	to	do	at	yield	 sign 	 s 	 	?	now	do	 some 	 thing 	 	different	.	``
that	would	not	work	.
so	,	what	the	world	 need 	 s 	 	now	is	a	new	type	of	sign	.
so	,	you	'd	have	a	little	 instruct 	 ion 	 	 be 	 low 	 	it	,	you	know	,	for	 t 	 hose 	 	who	did	n't	see	the	public	service	 announce 	 ments 	 	.
and	it	 merge 	 s 	 	the	stop	sign	and	yield	 sign 	 s 	 	.
it	's	kind	of	shaped	like	a	t	,	 a 	 s 	 	in	taking	 turn 	 s 	 	.
and	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	 result 	 s 	 	in	caution	.
when	people	come	to	an	 un 	 familiar 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	they	do	n't	know	how	to	deal	with	they	 s 	 low 	 	down	.
so	,	now	that	you	are	all	``	road	 scholar 	 s 	 	``	...
do	n't	wait	for	that	sign	to	be	 adopt 	 ed 	 	,	these	 thing 	 s 	 	do	n't	change	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
but	you	all	are	 member 	 s 	 	of	 commun 	 ities 	 	,	and	you	can	 exercis 	 e 	 	your	community	influence	to	create	more	 sens 	 ible 	 	traffic	 flow 	 s 	 	.
and	you	can	have	more	impact	on	the	environment	just	 get 	 ting 	 	your	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	to	change	these	 thing 	 s 	 	than	by	changing	your	vehicle	.	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
