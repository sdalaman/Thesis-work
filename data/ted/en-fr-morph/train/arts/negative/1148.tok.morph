i	'm	a	 pediatric 	 ian 	 	and	an	 anesthesio 	 logist 	 	,
so	i	put	children	to	sleep	for	a	living	.
and	i	'm	an	academic	,	so	i	put	 audience 	 s 	 	to	sleep	for	free	.
but	what	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	 most 	 ly 	 	do	is	i	manage	the	pain	management	service	at	the	packard	children	's	hospital	up	at	stanford	in	palo	 al 	 to 	 	.
and	it	's	from	the	experience	from	about	20	or	25	 year 	 s 	 	of	 do 	 ing 	 	that	that	i	want	to	 br 	 ing 	 	to	you	the	 mess 	 age 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	that	pain	is	a	disease	.
now	most	of	the	time	,	you	think	of	pain	 a 	 s 	 	a	symptom	of	a	disease	,
and	that	's	true	most	of	the	time	.
it	's	the	symptom	of	a	tumor	or	an	 infect 	 ion 	 	or	an	 inflamm 	 ation 	 	or	an	operation	.
but	about	10	percent	of	the	time	,	after	the	patient	 ha 	 s 	 	 re 	 cover 	 ed 	 	from	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 event 	 s 	 	,	pain	 persist 	 s 	 	.
it	 persist 	 s 	 	for	 month 	 s 	 	and	 often 	 time 	 s 	 	for	 year 	 s 	 	,
and	when	that	 happen 	 s 	 	,	it	is	 it 	 s 	 	own	disease	.
and	before	i	tell	you	about	how	it	is	that	we	think	that	 happen 	 s 	 	and	what	we	can	do	about	it	,	i	want	to	show	you	how	it	 feel 	 s 	 	for	my	 patient 	 s 	 	.
so	imagine	,	if	you	will	,	that	i	'm	 stro 	 king 	 	your	arm	with	 th 	 is 	 	feather	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	'm	 stro 	 king 	 	my	arm	right	now	.
now	,	i	want	you	to	imagine	that	i	'm	 stro 	 king 	 	it	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
 pleas 	 e 	 	keep	your	seat	.
a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	 feel 	 ing 	 	.
now	what	 do 	 es 	 	it	have	to	do	with	chronic	pain	?
imagine	,	if	you	will	,	these	two	 idea 	 s 	 	together	.
imagine	what	your	life	would	be	like	if	i	 we 	 re 	 	to	stroke	it	with	 th 	 is 	 	feather	,	but	your	brain	was	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	you	are	 feel 	 ing 	 	--	and	that	is	the	experience	of	my	 patient 	 s 	 	with	chronic	pain	.
in	fact	,	imagine	 some 	 thing 	 	even	 wo 	 rse 	 	.
imagine	i	 we 	 re 	 	to	stroke	your	child	's	arm	with	 th 	 is 	 	feather	,	and	 the 	 ir 	 	brain	[	was	]	 tell 	 ing 	 	them	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	hot	torch	.
that	was	the	experience	of	my	patient	,	chandler	,	whom	you	see	in	the	photograph	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	she	's	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	young	woman	.
she	was	16	 year 	 s 	 	old	last	year	when	i	met	her	,	and	she	 aspir 	 ed 	 	to	be	a	professional	 danc 	 er 	 	.
and	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	course	of	one	of	her	dance	 rehears 	 al 	 s 	 	,	she	fell	on	her	 out 	 stretch 	 ed 	 	arm	and	 sp 	 rain 	 ed 	 	her	wrist	.
now	you	would	 prob 	 ably 	 	imagine	,	 a 	 s 	 	she	did	,	that	a	wrist	 sp 	 rain 	 	is	a	trivial	event	in	a	person	's	life	.
wrap	it	in	an	ace	 band 	 age 	 	,	take	some	ibuprofen	for	a	week	or	two	,	and	that	's	the	end	of	the	story	.
but	in	chandler	's	case	,	that	was	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	story	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	her	arm	 look 	 ed 	 	like	when	she	came	to	my	clinic	about	three	 month 	 s 	 	after	her	 sp 	 rain 	 	.
you	can	see	that	the	arm	is	 dis 	 color 	 ed 	 	,	 pur 	 pl 	 ish 	 	in	color	.
it	was	 cadaver 	 ically 	 	cold	to	the	touch	.
the	 muscle 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 froze 	 n 	 	,	 paralyze 	 d 	 	--	 dy 	 s 	 ton 	 ic 	 	is	how	we	refer	to	that	.
the	pain	had	spread	from	her	wrist	to	her	 hand 	 s 	 	,	to	her	 finger 	 tip 	 s 	 	,	from	her	wrist	up	to	her	elbow	,	 al 	 most 	 	all	the	way	to	her	shoulder	.	but	the	worst	part	was	,	not	the	 spontane 	 ous 	 	pain	that	was	there	24	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	.
the	worst	part	was	that	she	had	 allo 	 dy 	 nia 	 	,	the	medical	term	for	the	 phenomen 	 on 	 	that	i	just	 illustr 	 ated 	 	with	the	feather	and	with	the	torch	.
the	 light 	 est 	 	touch	of	her	arm	--	the	touch	of	a	hand	,	the	touch	even	of	a	sleeve	,	of	a	 gar 	 ment 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	she	put	it	on	--	 caus 	 ed 	 	 excruciat 	 ing 	 	,	 burn 	 ing 	 	pain	.
how	can	the	nervous	system	get	 th 	 is 	 	so	wrong	?
how	can	the	nervous	system	 mis 	 interpret 	 	an	 innoc 	 ent 	 	 sens 	 ation 	 	like	the	touch	of	a	hand	and	turn	it	 in 	 to 	 	the	 male 	 vol 	 ent 	 	 sens 	 ation 	 	of	the	touch	of	the	flame	?
well	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	imagine	that	the	nervous	system	in	the	body	is	 hard 	 wired 	 	like	your	house	.
in	your	house	,	 wire 	 s 	 	run	in	the	wall	,	from	the	light	 s 	 witch 	 	to	a	junction	box	in	the	 ceil 	 ing 	 	and	from	the	junction	box	to	the	light	bulb	.
and	when	you	turn	the	 s 	 witch 	 	on	,	the	light	 go 	 es 	 	on	.
and	when	you	turn	the	 s 	 witch 	 	off	,	the	light	 go 	 es 	 	off	.
so	people	imagine	the	nervous	system	is	just	like	that	.
if	you	hit	your	thumb	with	a	hammer	,	these	 wire 	 s 	 	in	your	arm	--	that	,	of	course	,	we	call	 nerve 	 s 	 	--	transmit	the	information	 in 	 to 	 	the	junction	box	in	the	 spin 	 al 	 	cord	where	new	 wire 	 s 	 	,	new	 nerve 	 s 	 	,	take	the	information	up	to	the	brain	where	you	 be 	 come 	 	 conscious 	 ly 	 	aware	that	your	thumb	is	now	hurt	.
but	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	of	course	,	in	the	human	body	is	far	more	 complic 	 ated 	 	than	that	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	it	 be 	 ing 	 	the	case	that	that	junction	box	in	the	 spin 	 al 	 	cord	is	just	simple	where	one	nerve	 connect 	 s 	 	with	the	next	nerve	by	 re 	 leas 	 ing 	 	these	little	 brow 	 n 	 	 pack 	 et 	 s 	 	of	chemical	information	 call 	 ed 	 	 neuro 	 transmit 	 ter 	 s 	 	in	a	linear	one	-	on	-	one	fashion	,	in	fact	,	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	the	 neuro 	 transmit 	 ter 	 s 	 	 s 	 pill 	 	out	in	three	 dimension 	 s 	 	--	 lateral 	 ly 	 	,	 vert 	 ically 	 	,	up	and	down	in	the	 spin 	 al 	 	cord	--	and	they	start	 interact 	 ing 	 	with	other	 ad 	 ja 	 cent 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	.
these	 cell 	 s 	 	,	 call 	 ed 	 	 glia 	 l 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	,	 we 	 re 	 	once	thought	to	be	 un 	 import 	 ant 	 	structural	 element 	 s 	 	of	the	 spin 	 al 	 	cord	that	did	 noth 	 ing 	 	more	than	hold	all	the	 import 	 ant 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	together	,	like	the	 nerve 	 s 	 	.
but	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	the	 glia 	 l 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	have	a	vital	role	in	the	 modul 	 ation 	 	,	 ampl 	 ification 	 	and	,	in	the	case	of	pain	,	the	 distort 	 ion 	 	of	 sensor 	 y 	 	 experience 	 s 	 	.
these	 glia 	 l 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 activate 	 d 	 	.
 the 	 ir 	 	dna	 start 	 s 	 	to	synthesize	new	 protein 	 s 	 	,	which	 s 	 pill 	 	out	and	interact	with	 ad 	 ja 	 cent 	 	 nerve 	 s 	 	,
and	they	start	 re 	 leas 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 neuro 	 transmit 	 ter 	 s 	 	,
and	 t 	 hose 	 	 neuro 	 transmit 	 ter 	 s 	 	 s 	 pill 	 	out	and	activate	 ad 	 ja 	 cent 	 	 glia 	 l 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	,	and	so	on	and	so	forth	,	 un 	 til 	 	what	we	have	is	a	positive	 feed 	 back 	 	loop	.
it	's	 al 	 most 	 	 a 	 s 	 	if	 some 	 body 	 	came	 in 	 to 	 	your	home	and	 re 	 wired 	 	your	 wall 	 s 	 	so	that	the	next	time	you	 turn 	 ed 	 	on	the	light	 s 	 witch 	 	,	the	toilet	 flush 	 ed 	 	three	 door 	 s 	 	down	,	or	your	 dish 	 wash 	 er 	 	went	on	,	or	your	computer	monitor	 turn 	 ed 	 	off	.
that	's	crazy	,	but	that	's	,	in	fact	,	what	 happen 	 s 	 	with	chronic	pain	.
and	that	's	why	pain	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	own	disease	.
the	nervous	system	 ha 	 s 	 	 plastic 	 ity 	 	.
it	 change 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 morph 	 s 	 	in	 respons 	 e 	 	to	 stimul 	 i 	 	.
well	,	what	do	we	do	about	that	?
what	can	we	do	in	a	case	like	chandler	's	?
we	treat	these	 patient 	 s 	 	in	a	 ra 	 ther 	 	 crud 	 e 	 	fashion	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	in	time	.
we	treat	them	with	symptom	-	 modify 	 ing 	 	 drug 	 s 	 	--	 pain 	 killer 	 s 	 	--	which	are	,	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	not	 ver 	 y 	 	effective	for	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	pain	.
we	take	 nerve 	 s 	 	that	are	noisy	and	active	that	should	be	quiet	,	and	we	put	them	to	sleep	with	local	 anesthet 	 ic 	 s 	 	.
and	most	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	what	we	do	is	we	use	a	 rigor 	 ous 	 	,	and	often	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	,	process	of	physical	therapy	and	 occupation 	 al 	 	therapy	to	 re 	 train 	 	the	 nerve 	 s 	 	in	the	nervous	system	to	respond	 normal 	 ly 	 	to	the	 activ 	 ities 	 	and	 sensor 	 y 	 	 experience 	 s 	 	that	are	part	of	 every 	 day 	 	life	.
and	we	support	all	of	that	with	an	intensive	 psycho 	 therapy 	 	program	to	address	the	 desponde 	 ncy 	 	,	despair	and	 depress 	 ion 	 	that	 al 	 ways 	 	 accompani 	 es 	 	severe	,	chronic	pain	.
it	's	 success 	 ful 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	from	 th 	 is 	 	video	of	chandler	,	who	,	two	 month 	 s 	 	after	we	first	met	her	,	is	now	 do 	 ing 	 s 	 	a	back	flip	.
and	i	had	lunch	with	her	 yester 	 day 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	she	's	a	college	student	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	dance	at	long	beach	here	,
and	she	's	 do 	 ing 	 	 absolute 	 ly 	 	fantastic	.
but	the	future	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	even	 bright 	 er 	 	.
the	future	 hold 	 s 	 	the	promise	that	new	 drug 	 s 	 	will	be	 develop 	 ed 	 	that	are	not	symptom	-	 modify 	 ing 	 	 drug 	 s 	 	that	 simpl 	 y 	 	mask	the	problem	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	have	now	,	but	that	will	be	disease	-	 modify 	 ing 	 	 drug 	 s 	 	that	will	 actual 	 ly 	 	go	right	to	the	root	of	the	problem	and	attack	 t 	 hose 	 	 glia 	 l 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	,	or	 t 	 hose 	 	 per 	 nic 	 ious 	 	 protein 	 s 	 	that	the	 glia 	 l 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	elaborate	,	that	 s 	 pill 	 	over	and	cause	 th 	 is 	 	central	nervous	system	wind	-	up	,	or	 plastic 	 ity 	 	,	that	so	is	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 distort 	 ing 	 	and	 ampl 	 ifying 	 	the	 sensor 	 y 	 	experience	that	we	call	pain	.
so	i	have	hope	that	in	the	future	,	the	 prophet 	 ic 	 	 word 	 s 	 	of	george	carlin	will	be	 real 	 ized 	 	,	who	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	my	 philosoph 	 y 	 	:	no	pain	,	no	pain	.	``
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
