in	1994	,	i	 walk 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 pri 	 son 	 	in	cambodia	,	and	i	met	a	12	-	year	-	old	boy	who	had	 be 	 en 	 	 torture 	 d 	 	and	was	 deni 	 ed 	 	access	to	counsel	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	 look 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	his	 eye 	 s 	 	,	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	for	the	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 letter 	 s 	 	i	had	written	for	 politic 	 al 	 	 prisoner 	 s 	 	,	that	i	would	never	have	written	a	letter	for	him	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	was	not	a	12	-	year	-	old	boy	who	had	 d 	 one 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	for	 any 	 body 	 	.
he	was	not	a	 politic 	 al 	 	prisoner	.
he	was	a	12	-	year	-	old	boy	who	had	 stole 	 n 	 	a	 bi 	 cycle 	 	.
what	i	 al 	 so 	 	 real 	 ized 	 	at	that	point	was	that	it	was	not	 on 	 ly 	 	cambodia	,	but	of	the	113	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	that	torture	,	93	of	these	 count 	 ries 	 	have	all	 pass 	 ed 	 	 law 	 s 	 	that	say	you	have	a	right	to	a	lawyer	and	you	have	a	right	not	to	be	 torture 	 d 	 	.
and	what	i	 recogn 	 ized 	 	was	that	there	was	an	 in 	 credible 	 	window	of	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	for	us	 a 	 s 	 	a	world	community	to	come	together	and	end	torture	 a 	 s 	 	an	 invest 	 ig 	 ative 	 	tool	.
we	often	think	of	torture	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 politic 	 al 	 	torture	or	 re 	 serv 	 ed 	 	for	just	the	worst	,	but	,	in	fact	,	95	percent	of	torture	 to 	 day 	 	is	not	for	 politic 	 al 	 	 prisoner 	 s 	 	.
it	is	for	people	who	are	in	broken	-	down	legal	 system 	 s 	 	,	and	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	torture	is	the	 cheap 	 est 	 	form	of	investigation	--	it	's	 cheap 	 er 	 	than	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	legal	system	,	 cheap 	 er 	 	than	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	lawyer	and	early	access	to	counsel	--	it	is	what	 happen 	 s 	 	most	of	the	time	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	 to 	 day 	 	that	it	is	possible	for	us	 a 	 s 	 	a	world	community	,	if	we	make	a	decision	,	to	come	together	and	end	torture	 a 	 s 	 	an	 invest 	 ig 	 ative 	 	tool	in	our	 life 	 time 	 	,	but	it	will	 requir 	 e 	 	three	 thing 	 s 	 	.
first	is	the	training	,	 empower 	 ment 	 	,	and	 connect 	 ion 	 	of	 defend 	 ers 	 	 world 	 wide 	 	.
the	second	is	 insur 	 ing 	 	that	there	is	 system 	 atic 	 	early	access	to	counsel	.
and	the	third	is	 commit 	 ment 	 	.
so	in	the	year	2000	,	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	wonder	,	what	if	we	came	together	?	could	we	do	 some 	 thing 	 	for	these	93	 count 	 ries 	 	?
and	i	 found 	 ed 	 	 inter 	 national 	 	 bridge 	 s 	 	to	justice	which	 ha 	 s 	 	a	specific	mission	of	 end 	 ing 	 	torture	 a 	 s 	 	an	 invest 	 ig 	 ative 	 	tool	and	 implement 	 ing 	 	due	process	 right 	 s 	 	in	the	93	 count 	 ries 	 	by	placing	trained	 lawyer 	 s 	 	at	an	early	stage	in	police	 station 	 s 	 	and	in	 court 	 rooms 	 	.
my	first	 experience 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	did	come	from	cambodia	,	and	at	the	time	i	remember	first	coming	to	cambodia	and	there	 we 	 re 	 	,	in	1994	,	still	less	than	10	 attorney 	 s 	 	in	the	country	 be 	 cause 	 	the	khmer	rouge	had	 kill 	 ed 	 	them	all	.
and	even	20	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	there	was	 on 	 ly 	 	10	 lawyer 	 s 	 	in	the	country	,	so	 con 	 sequent 	 ly 	 	you	'd	walk	 in 	 to 	 	a	 pri 	 son 	 	and	not	 on 	 ly 	 	would	you	meet	12	-	year	-	old	 boy 	 s 	 	,	you	'd	meet	women	and	you	'd	say	,	``	why	are	you	here	?	``	women	would	say	,	``	well	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	here	for	10	 year 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	my	husband	 commit 	 ted 	 	a	crime	,	but	they	ca	n't	find	him	.	``	so	it	's	just	a	place	where	there	was	no	rule	of	law	.
the	first	group	of	 defend 	 ers 	 	came	together	and	i	still	remember	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	was	training	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	what	do	you	do	for	an	investigation	?	``	and	there	was	silence	in	the	class	,	and	 final 	 ly 	 	one	woman	stood	up	,	[	 in 	 audible 	 	name	]	,	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	``	khrew	,	``	which	 mean 	 s 	 	``	teacher	.	``
she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	have	 defend 	 ed 	 	more	than	a	hundred	people	,	and	i	've	never	had	to	do	any	investigation	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	all	come	with	 confess 	 ions 	 	.	``	and	we	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	class	,	the	fact	that	number	one	,	the	 confess 	 ions 	 	might	not	be	 reli 	 able 	 	,	but	number	two	,	we	did	not	want	to	 encourag 	 e 	 	the	police	to	keep	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	was	now	against	the	law	.
and	it	took	a	lot	of	courage	for	these	 defend 	 ers 	 	to	decide	that	they	would	begin	to	stand	up	and	support	each	other	in	 implement 	 ing 	 	these	 law 	 s 	 	.
and	i	still	remember	the	first	 case 	 s 	 	where	they	came	,	all	25	together	,	she	would	stand	up	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	in	the	back	,	and	they	would	support	her	,	and	the	 judg 	 es 	 	 ke 	 pt 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	no	,	no	,	no	,	no	,	we	're	going	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	the	exact	same	way	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	them	.	``	but	one	day	the	perfect	case	came	,	and	it	was	a	woman	who	was	a	 veget 	 able 	 	seller	,	she	was	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	 out 	 side 	 	of	a	house	.
she	 s 	 aid 	 	she	 actual 	 ly 	 	saw	the	person	run	out	who	she	 think 	 s 	 	stole	 what 	 ever 	 	the	 jewel 	 ry 	 	was	,	but	the	police	came	,	they	got	her	,	there	was	 noth 	 ing 	 	on	her	.
she	was	 pregn 	 ant 	 	at	the	time	.	she	had	 cigar 	 ette 	 	 burn 	 s 	 	on	her	.	she	'd	 mis 	 carried 	 	.
and	when	they	 br 	 ought 	 	her	case	to	the	 judg 	 e 	 	,	for	the	first	time	he	stood	up	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	there	's	no	evidence	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	your	torture	 confess 	 ion 	 	and	you	will	be	released	.	``	and	the	 defend 	 ers 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	to	take	 case 	 s 	 	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	and	you	will	see	,	they	have	step	by	step	 beg 	 an 	 	to	change	the	course	of	 histo 	 ry 	 	in	cambodia	.
but	cambodia	is	not	 al 	 one 	 	.
i	used	to	think	,	well	is	it	cambodia	?
or	is	it	other	 count 	 ries 	 	?
but	it	is	in	so	 man 	 y 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	.
in	burundi	i	 walk 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 pri 	 son 	 	and	it	was	n't	a	12	-	year	-	old	boy	,	it	was	an	8	-	year	-	old	boy	for	 steal 	 ing 	 	a	mobile	phone	.
or	a	woman	,	i	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	her	baby	,	 re 	 ally 	 	cute	baby	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	``	your	baby	is	so	cute	.	``	it	was	n't	a	baby	,	she	was	three	.
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	``	 yea 	 h 	 	,	but	she	's	why	i	'm	here	,	``	 be 	 cause 	 	she	was	 accus 	 ed 	 	of	 steal 	 ing 	 	two	 dia 	 per 	 s 	 	and	an	iron	for	her	baby	and	still	had	 be 	 en 	 	in	 pri 	 son 	 	.
and	when	i	 walk 	 ed 	 	up	to	the	 pri 	 son 	 	director	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	've	got	to	let	her	out	.
a	 judg 	 e 	 	would	let	her	out	.	``	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	we	can	talk	about	it	,	but	look	at	my	 pri 	 son 	 	.	 eight 	 y 	 	percent	of	the	two	thousand	people	here	are	 with 	 out 	 	a	lawyer	.	what	can	we	do	?	``	so	 lawyer 	 s 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	to	 courage 	 ously 	 	stand	up	together	to	organize	a	system	where	they	can	take	 case 	 s 	 	.
but	we	 real 	 ized 	 	that	it	's	not	 on 	 ly 	 	the	training	of	the	 lawyer 	 s 	 	,	but	the	 connect 	 ion 	 	of	the	 lawyer 	 s 	 	that	 make 	 s 	 	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	in	cambodia	,	it	was	that	[	 in 	 audible 	 	name	]	did	not	go	 al 	 one 	 	but	she	had	24	 lawyer 	 s 	 	with	her	who	stood	up	together	.	and	in	the	same	way	,	in	 chin 	 a 	 	,	they	 al 	 ways 	 	tell	me	,	``	it	's	like	a	fresh	wind	in	the	desert	when	we	can	come	together	.	``	or	in	zimbabwe	,	where	i	remember	 innoc 	 ent 	 	,	after	coming	out	of	a	 pri 	 son 	 	where	 every 	 body 	 	stood	up	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	here	for	one	year	,	eight	 year 	 s 	 	,	12	 year 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	a	lawyer	,	``	he	came	and	we	had	a	training	together	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	have	heard	it	 s 	 aid 	 	``	--	 be 	 cause 	 	he	had	heard	people	 mum 	 bling 	 	and	 grum 	 bling 	 	--	``	i	have	heard	it	 s 	 aid 	 	that	we	can	not	help	to	create	justice	 be 	 cause 	 	we	do	not	have	the	 resource 	 s 	 	.	``	and	then	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	but	i	want	you	to	know	that	the	lack	of	 resource 	 s 	 	is	never	an	excuse	for	 in 	 justice 	 	.	``	and	with	that	,	he	 success 	 fully 	 	 organize 	 d 	 	68	 lawyer 	 s 	 	who	have	 be 	 en 	 	 system 	 at 	 ically 	 	taking	the	 case 	 s 	 	.
the	key	that	we	see	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	is	training	and	then	early	access	.
i	was	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	in	egypt	,	and	was	inspired	to	meet	with	 an 	 other 	 	group	of	 lawyer 	 s 	 	,	and	what	they	told	me	is	that	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	look	,	we	do	n't	have	police	on	the	 street 	 s 	 	now	.	the	police	are	one	of	the	main	 reason 	 s 	 	why	we	had	the	revolution	.	they	 we 	 re 	 	 tor 	 tur 	 ing 	 	 every 	 body 	 	all	the	time	.	``	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	but	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	that	have	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	gone	in	to	the	 develop 	 ment 	 	of	the	legal	system	here	.
what	's	going	on	?	``	i	met	with	one	of	the	 develop 	 ment 	 	 age 	 ncies 	 	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	training	 prosecut 	 ors 	 	and	 judg 	 es 	 	,	which	is	the	normal	bias	,	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	 defend 	 ers 	 	.
and	they	 show 	 ed 	 	me	a	manual	which	 actual 	 ly 	 	was	an	 excel 	 lent 	 	manual	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'm	gon	na	copy	 th 	 is 	 	.	``	it	had	 every 	 thing 	 	in	it	.	 lawyer 	 s 	 	can	come	at	the	police	station	.	it	was	perfect	.
 prosecut 	 ors 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 perfect 	 ly 	 	trained	.
but	i	 s 	 aid 	 	to	them	,	``	i	just	have	one	question	,	which	is	,	by	the	time	that	 every 	 body 	 	got	to	the	 prosecut 	 or 	 	's	 off 	 ice 	 	,	what	had	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	them	?	``	and	after	a	pause	,	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	they	had	 be 	 en 	 	 torture 	 d 	 	.	``	so	the	 piece 	 s 	 	are	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	the	training	of	the	 lawyer 	 s 	 	,	but	us	 find 	 ing 	 	a	way	to	 system 	 at 	 ically 	 	implement	early	access	to	counsel	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	the	 safe 	 guard 	 	in	the	system	for	people	who	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 torture 	 d 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	tell	you	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	aware	of	the	fact	that	it	 sound 	 s 	 	like	,	``	oh	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	it	 sound 	 s 	 	like	we	could	do	it	,	but	can	we	 re 	 ally 	 	do	it	?	``	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 sound 	 s 	 	big	.
and	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	why	i	 believ 	 e 	 	it	's	possible	.
the	first	reason	is	the	people	on	the	ground	who	find	ways	of	creating	 miracle 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 commit 	 ment 	 	.
it	's	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 innoc 	 ent 	 	,	who	i	told	you	about	in	zimbabwe	,	but	 defend 	 ers 	 	all	over	the	world	who	are	looking	for	these	 piece 	 s 	 	.
we	have	a	program	 call 	 ed 	 	justicemakers	,	and	we	 real 	 ized 	 	there	are	people	that	are	 courage 	 ous 	 	and	want	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	,	but	how	can	we	support	them	?
so	it	's	an	 on 	 line 	 	contest	where	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	five	thousand	 dollar 	 s 	 	if	you	come	up	with	and	 innov 	 ative 	 	way	of	 implement 	 ing 	 	justice	.
and	there	are	30	justicemakers	 through 	 out 	 	the	world	,	from	sri	lanka	to	swaziland	to	the	drc	,	who	with	five	thousand	 dollar 	 s 	 	do	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	through	sms	 program 	 s 	 	,	through	 para 	 legal 	 	 program 	 s 	 	,	through	 what 	 ever 	 	they	can	do	.
and	it	's	not	 on 	 ly 	 	these	justicemakers	,	but	people	we	 courage 	 ously 	 	see	figure	out	who	 the 	 ir 	 	 network 	 s 	 	are	and	how	they	can	move	it	forward	.
so	in	 chin 	 a 	 	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	great	 law 	 s 	 	came	out	where	it	 say 	 s 	 	police	can	not	torture	people	or	they	will	be	 punish 	 ed 	 	.
and	i	was	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	side	by	side	with	one	of	our	 ver 	 y 	 	 courage 	 ous 	 	 lawyer 	 s 	 	,	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	how	can	we	get	 th 	 is 	 	out	?	how	can	we	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	 implement 	 ed 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	fantastic	.	``	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	``	well	,	do	you	have	money	?	``	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no.	``	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	that	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	we	can	still	figure	it	out	.	``	and	on	december	4	,	he	 organize 	 d 	 	three	thousand	 member 	 s 	 	of	the	youth	 commun 	 ist 	 	league	,	from	14	of	the	top	law	 school 	 s 	 	,	who	 organize 	 d 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	 develop 	 ed 	 	 post 	 ers 	 	with	the	new	 law 	 s 	 	,	and	went	to	the	police	 station 	 s 	 	and	 beg 	 an 	 	what	he	 say 	 s 	 	is	a	non	-	violent	legal	revolution	to	protect	citizen	 right 	 s 	 	.
so	i	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	the	fact	that	we	need	to	train	and	support	 defend 	 ers 	 	.
we	need	to	 system 	 at 	 ically 	 	implement	early	access	to	counsel	.
but	the	third	and	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	is	that	we	make	a	 commit 	 ment 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	people	often	say	to	me	,	``	you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	great	,	but	it	's	 wild 	 ly 	 	 ideal 	 istic 	 	.
never	going	to	happen	.	``	and	the	reason	that	i	think	that	 t 	 hose 	 	 word 	 s 	 	are	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 we 	 re 	 	the	same	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 word 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	used	for	people	who	 decide 	 d 	 	they	would	end	 slave 	 ry 	 	,	or	end	apartheid	.
it	 beg 	 an 	 	with	a	small	group	of	people	who	 decide 	 d 	 	they	would	commit	.
now	,	there	's	one	of	our	 favor 	 ite 	 	 poem 	 s 	 	from	the	 defend 	 ers 	 	,	which	they	share	from	each	other	,	is	:	``	take	courage	 friend 	 s 	 	,	the	road	is	often	long	,	the	path	is	never	clear	,	and	the	 s 	 take 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	high	,	but	deep	down	,	you	are	not	 al 	 one 	 	.	``	and	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	if	we	can	come	together	 a 	 s 	 	a	world	community	to	support	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 defend 	 ers 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 every 	 one 	 	in	the	system	who	is	looking	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	it	,	we	can	end	torture	 a 	 s 	 	an	 invest 	 ig 	 ative 	 	tool	.
i	end	 al 	 ways 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	the	 question 	 s 	 	are	--	and	i	'd	be	happy	to	talk	to	you	at	any	point	--	``	but	what	can	i	 re 	 ally 	 	do	?	``	well	,	i	would	say	 th 	 is 	 	.	first	of	all	,	you	know	what	you	can	do	.	but	second	of	all	,	i	would	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	the	story	of	vishna	,	who	 actual 	 ly 	 	was	my	inspiration	for	 start 	 ing 	 	 inter 	 national 	 	 bridge 	 s 	 	to	justice	.
vishna	was	a	4	-	year	-	old	boy	when	i	met	him	who	was	born	in	a	cambodian	 pri 	 son 	 	in	kandal	 pro 	 vince 	 	.	but	 be 	 cause 	 	he	was	born	in	the	 pri 	 son 	 	,	 every 	 body 	 	 love 	 d 	 	him	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	the	 guard 	 s 	 	,	so	he	was	the	 on 	 ly 	 	one	who	was	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	come	in	and	out	of	the	 bar 	 s 	 	.
so	,	you	know	,	there	's	 bar 	 s 	 	.	and	by	the	time
that	vishna	was	 get 	 ting 	 	 big 	 ger 	 	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	what	 get 	 s 	 	 big 	 ger 	 	?	your	head	 get 	 s 	 	 big 	 ger 	 	.
so	he	would	come	to	the	first	bar	,	the	second	bar	and	then	the	third	bar	,	and	then	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	move	his	head	so	he	could	fit	through	,	and	come	back	,	third	,	second	,	first	.	and	he	would	grab	my	 pink 	 ie 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	what	he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	every	day	is	he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	go	visit	.
