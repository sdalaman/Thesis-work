there	's	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 state 	 ment 	 	on	the	screen	that	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	light	 create 	 s 	 	 ambi 	 ance 	 	,	light	 make 	 s 	 	the	feel	of	a	space	,	and	light	is	 al 	 so 	 	the	 express 	 ion 	 	of	structure	.	``	well	that	was	not	by	me	.
that	was	,	of	course	,	by	le	corbusier	,	the	famous	architect	.
and	here	you	can	see	what	he	 me 	 ant 	 	in	one	of	his	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 building 	 s 	 	--	the	 cha 	 pel 	 	notre	dame	du	haut	,	ronchamp	--	where	he	 create 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	light	that	he	could	 on 	 ly 	 	make	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	 al 	 so 	 	dark	.
and	i	think	that	is	the	 quint 	 es 	 s 	 ence 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	18	-	minute	talk	--	that	there	is	no	good	 light 	 ing 	 	that	is	 health 	 y 	 	and	for	our	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	 with 	 out 	 	proper	 dark 	 ness 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	we	 normal 	 ly 	 	would	light	our	 off 	 ice 	 s 	 	.
we	have	 code 	 s 	 	and	 standard 	 s 	 	that	tell	us	that	the	 light 	 s 	 	should	be	so	much	lux	and	of	great	 uniform 	 ity 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	how	we	create	uniform	 light 	 ing 	 	from	one	wall	to	the	other	in	a	regular	grid	of	 lamp 	 s 	 	.
and	that	is	 quit 	 e 	 	different	from	what	i	just	 show 	 ed 	 	you	from	le	corbusier	.
if	we	would	 app 	 ly 	 	these	 code 	 s 	 	and	 standard 	 s 	 	to	the	 pan 	 the 	 on 	 	in	rome	,	it	would	never	have	 look 	 ed 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	light	feature	that	 go 	 es 	 	around	there	all	by	 it 	 self 	 	can	 on 	 ly 	 	appear	 be 	 cause 	 	there	is	 al 	 so 	 	 dark 	 ness 	 	in	that	same	building	.
and	the	same	is	more	or	less	what	santiago	calatrava	 s 	 aid 	 	when	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	light	:	i	make	it	in	my	 building 	 s 	 	for	comfort	.	``	and	he	did	n't	mean	the	comfort	of	a	five	-	course	 d 	 inner 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	a	one	-	course	meal	,	but	he	 re 	 ally 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	the	comfort	of	the	quality	of	the	building	for	the	people	.
he	 me 	 ant 	 	that	you	can	see	the	sky	and	that	you	can	experience	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
and	he	 create 	 d 	 	these	 gorge 	 ous 	 	 building 	 s 	 	where	you	can	see	the	sky	,	and	where	you	can	experience	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	that	give	us	a	better	life	in	the	built	environment	,	just	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	relevance	of	light	in	 it 	 s 	 	 bright 	 ness 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	 shadow 	 s 	 	.
what	it	all	 boil 	 s 	 	down	to	is	,	of	course	,	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	image	of	the	 s 	 un 	 	may	suggest	that	the	 s 	 un 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 e 	 vil 	 	and	 aggress 	 ive 	 	,
but	we	should	not	forget	that	all	energy	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	 actual 	 ly 	 	 come 	 s 	 	from	the	 s 	 un 	 	,
and	light	is	 on 	 ly 	 	a	 manifest 	 ation 	 	of	that	energy	.
the	 s 	 un 	 	is	for	 dynamic 	 s 	 	,	for	color	 change 	 s 	 	.	the	 s 	 un 	 	is	for	 beaut 	 y 	 	in	our	environment	,	like	in	 th 	 is 	 	building	--	the	high	museum	in	atlanta	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 create 	 d 	 	by	renzo	piano	from	italy	,	together	with	arup	 light 	 ing 	 	,	a	 brilli 	 ant 	 	team	of	 light 	 ing 	 	 design 	 ers 	 	,	who	 create 	 d 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	subtle	 modul 	 ation 	 	of	light	 a 	 cross 	 	the	space	,	 respond 	 ing 	 	to	what	the	 s 	 un 	 	 do 	 es 	 	 out 	 side 	 	,	just	 be 	 cause 	 	of	all	these	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 open 	 ing 	 s 	 	in	the	roof	.
so	in	an	 in 	 direct 	 	way	,	you	can	see	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
and	what	they	did	is	they	 create 	 d 	 	an	 integ 	 ral 	 	building	element	to	improve	the	quality	of	the	space	that	 surround 	 s 	 	the	 visit 	 ors 	 	of	the	museum	.
they	 create 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 sha 	 de 	 	that	you	can	see	here	,	which	 actual 	 ly 	 	 cover 	 s 	 	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	but	 open 	 s 	 	up	to	the	good	light	from	the	sky	.
and	here	you	can	see	how	they	 re 	 ally 	 	 craft 	 ed 	 	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	design	process	with	physical	 model 	 s 	 	,	with	 quant 	 itative 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 qual 	 itative 	 	,	 method 	 s 	 	to	come	to	a	final	solution	that	is	 tru 	 ly 	 	 integrate 	 d 	 	and	 complete 	 ly 	 	 hol 	 istic 	 	with	the	 architect 	 ure 	 	.
they	 allow 	 ed 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	a	few	 mistak 	 es 	 	 a 	 long 	 	the	way	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	here	,	there	's	some	direct	light	on	the	floor	,	but	they	could	 eas 	 ily 	 	figure	out	where	that	 come 	 s 	 	from	.
and	they	allow	people	in	that	building	to	 re 	 ally 	 	enjoy	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	the	good	part	of	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
and	 enjoy 	 ing 	 	the	 s 	 un 	 	can	be	in	 man 	 y 	 	different	ways	,	of	course	.
it	can	be	just	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	or	 may 	 be 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	which	is	 ra 	 ther 	 	peculiar	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	in	1963	--	the	 view 	 ing 	 	of	a	 s 	 un 	 	eclipse	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	just	a	bit	bright	up	there	,	so	these	people	have	found	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 intrigu 	 ing 	 	solution	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	,	i	think	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 illustr 	 ative 	 	image	of	what	i	try	to	say	--	that	the	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 dynamic 	 s 	 	of	 s 	 un 	 	,	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	these	 in 	 to 	 	the	building	,	 create 	 s 	 	a	quality	of	our	built	environment	that	 tru 	 ly 	 	 enhance 	 s 	 	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	about	 dark 	 ness 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	about	 light 	 ness 	 	,	of	course	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 other 	 wise 	 	you	do	n't	see	these	 dynamic 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	the	first	 off 	 ice 	 	that	i	 show 	 ed 	 	you	in	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	talk	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	well	-	known	 off 	 ice 	 	,	which	is	the	white	group	.
they	are	in	green	energy	 consult 	 ing 	 	,	or	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
and	they	 re 	 ally 	 	practice	what	they	preach	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 off 	 ice 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	any	electric	 light 	 ing 	 	at	all	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	on	one	side	 th 	 is 	 	big	,	big	glass	window	that	 help 	 s 	 	to	let	the	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	enter	deep	 in 	 to 	 	the	space	and	create	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	quality	there	and	a	great	dynamic	range	.
so	it	can	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 d 	 im 	 	over	there	,	and	you	do	your	work	,	and	it	can	be	 ver 	 y 	 	bright	over	there	,	and	you	do	your	work	.
but	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	human	eye	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	be	 remark 	 ably 	 	 adapt 	 able 	 	to	all	these	different	light	 condition 	 s 	 	that	together	create	an	environment	that	is	never	 bor 	 ing 	 	and	that	is	never	dull	,	and	 there 	 fore 	 	 help 	 s 	 	us	to	enhance	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
i	 re 	 ally 	 	owe	a	short	 introduc 	 tion 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	man	to	you	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	richard	kelly	who	was	born	100	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	which	is	the	reason	i	 br 	 ing 	 	him	up	now	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	kind	of	an	 annivers 	 ary 	 	year	.
in	the	1930s	,	richard	kelly	was	the	first	person	to	 re 	 ally 	 	 de 	 scribe 	 	a	 method 	 ology 	 	of	modern	 light 	 ing 	 	design	.
and	he	 co 	 in 	 ed 	 	three	 term 	 s 	 	,	which	are	``	 f 	 oc 	 al 	 	glow	,	``	``	 ambi 	 ent 	 	 luminesce 	 nce 	 	``	and	``	play	of	the	 brilli 	 ants 	 	``	--	three	 ver 	 y 	 	 distinct 	 ly 	 	different	 idea 	 s 	 	about	light	in	 architect 	 ure 	 	that	all	together	make	up	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	experience	.
so	you	begin	with	 f 	 oc 	 al 	 	glow	.
he	 me 	 ant 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	--	where	the	light	 give 	 s 	 	direction	to	the	space	and	 help 	 s 	 	you	to	get	around	.
or	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	which	is	the	 light 	 ing 	 	design	he	did	for	general	 motor 	 s 	 	,	for	the	car	 show 	 room 	 	.
and	you	enter	that	space	,	and	you	feel	like	,	``	 w 	 ow 	 	!	 th 	 is 	 	is	so	 impress 	 ive 	 	,	``	just	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 f 	 oc 	 al 	 	point	,	 th 	 is 	 	huge	light	source	in	the	middle	.
to	me	it	is	 some 	 thing 	 	from	theatre	,	and	i	will	get	back	to	that	a	little	bit	 lat 	 er 	 	.
it	's	the	 spot 	 light 	 	on	the	artist	that	 help 	 s 	 	you	to	focus	.
it	could	 al 	 so 	 	be	the	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	that	 break 	 s 	 	through	the	 cloud 	 s 	 	and	 light 	 s 	 	up	a	patch	of	the	land	,	 high 	 light 	 ing 	 	it	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	the	 d 	 im 	 	environment	.
or	it	can	be	in	 to 	 day 	 	's	 re 	 tail 	 	,	in	the	 shop 	 ping 	 	environment	--	 light 	 ing 	 	the	 merchan 	 dis 	 e 	 	and	creating	 accent 	 s 	 	that	help	you	to	get	around	.
 ambi 	 ent 	 	 luminesce 	 nce 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	different	.
richard	kelly	saw	it	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	infinite	,	 some 	 thing 	 	 with 	 out 	 	any	focus	,	 some 	 thing 	 	where	all	 detail 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 dis 	 solve 	 	in	 in 	 fin 	 ity 	 	.
and	i	see	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 comfort 	 able 	 	kind	of	light	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 help 	 s 	 	us	to	relax	and	to	 contempl 	 ate 	 	.
it	could	 al 	 so 	 	be	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	:	the	national	museum	of	science	in	london	,	where	 th 	 is 	 	blue	is	 em 	 bracing 	 	all	the	 exhibit 	 ions 	 	and	 gall 	 eries 	 	in	one	large	 gest 	 ure 	 	.
and	then	 final 	 ly 	 	,	kelly	's	play	of	 brilli 	 ants 	 	attitude	,
that	 re 	 ally 	 	some	play	of	the	 sky 	 line 	 	of	hong	kong	,	or	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	the	 chan 	 deli 	 er 	 	in	the	opera	house	,	or	in	the	theater	here	,	which	is	a	 decor 	 ation 	 	,	the	 ic 	 ing 	 	on	the	cake	,	 some 	 thing 	 	 play 	 ful 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	just	an	 add 	 ition 	 	to	the	 architect 	 ural 	 	environment	,	i	would	say	.
these	three	distinct	 element 	 s 	 	,	together	,	make	a	 light 	 ing 	 	environment	that	 help 	 s 	 	us	to	feel	better	.
and	we	can	 on 	 ly 	 	create	these	out	of	 dark 	 ness 	 	.
and	i	will	explain	that	further	.
and	i	guess	that	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	richard	kelly	,	here	on	the	left	,	was	 explain 	 ing 	 	to	ludwig	mies	van	der	rohe	.
and	 be 	 hind 	 	them	,	you	see	that	seagram	building	that	 lat 	 er 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	an	icon	of	modern	 light 	 ing 	 	design	.
 t 	 hose 	 	 time 	 s 	 	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	some	early	 attempt 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	for	light	therapy	 al 	 ready 	 	.
you	can	see	here	a	photo	from	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	library	of	medicine	,	where	people	are	put	in	the	 s 	 un 	 	to	get	better	.
it	's	a	little	bit	of	a	different	story	,	 th 	 is 	 	health	 a 	 spect 	 	of	light	,	than	what	i	'm	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	 to 	 day 	 	.
in	 to 	 day 	 	's	modern	medicine	,	there	is	a	real	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	light	in	an	 al 	 most 	 	 bio 	 chemical 	 	way	.
and	there	is	the	idea	that	,	when	we	look	at	 thing 	 s 	 	,	it	is	the	yellow	light	that	 help 	 s 	 	us	the	most	,	that	we	are	the	most	sensitive	for	.
but	our	 circa 	 d 	 ian 	 	 rhythm 	 s 	 	,	which	are	the	 rhythm 	 s 	 	that	help	us	to	wake	and	sleep	and	be	alert	and	 relax 	 ed 	 	and	so	forth	and	so	on	,	they	are	much	more	 trigger 	 ed 	 	by	blue	light	.
and	by	 modul 	 ating 	 	the	amount	of	blue	in	our	environment	,	we	can	help	people	to	relax	,	or	to	be	alert	,	to	fall	 a 	 sleep 	 	,	or	to	stay	awake	.
and	that	is	how	,	 may 	 be 	 	in	the	near	future	,	light	can	help	 hospital 	 s 	 	to	make	people	better	 soon 	 er 	 	,	 re 	 cover 	 	them	 quick 	 er 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	in	the	 air 	 plane 	 	,	we	can	 over 	 come 	 	jet	lag	like	that	.
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	in	school	,	we	can	help	children	to	learn	better	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 concent 	 rate 	 	more	on	 the 	 ir 	 	work	.
and	you	can	imagine	a	lot	more	 application 	 s 	 	.
but	i	would	like	to	talk	further	about	the	combination	of	light	and	 dark 	 ness 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	quality	in	our	life	.
so	light	is	,	of	course	,	for	social	 interact 	 ion 	 	 al 	 so 	 	--	to	create	 relationship 	 s 	 	with	all	the	 feature 	 s 	 	around	us	.
it	is	the	place	where	we	gather	around	when	we	have	to	say	 some 	 thing 	 	to	each	other	.
and	it	is	all	about	 th 	 is 	 	planet	.
but	when	you	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	planet	at	night	,	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	most	 shock 	 ing 	 	image	in	my	talk	 to 	 day 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	light	here	 go 	 es 	 	up	to	the	sky	.	it	never	 reach 	 es 	 	the	ground	where	it	was	 me 	 ant 	 	for	.
it	never	is	to	the	benefit	of	people	.
it	 on 	 ly 	 	 spoil 	 s 	 	the	 dark 	 ness 	 	.
so	at	a	global	scale	,	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	,	i	mean	,	that	is	 quit 	 e 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	,	what	you	see	here	--	how	much	light	 go 	 es 	 	up	 in 	 to 	 	the	sky	and	never	 reach 	 es 	 	the	ground	.
 be 	 cause 	 	if	we	look	at	the	earth	the	way	it	should	be	,	it	would	be	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	inspiring	image	where	 dark 	 ness 	 	is	for	our	 imagin 	 ation 	 	and	for	 contempl 	 ation 	 	and	to	help	us	to	 re 	 late 	 	to	 every 	 thing 	 	.
the	world	is	changing	 th 	 ough 	 	,	and	 urban 	 ization 	 	is	a	big	driver	of	 every 	 thing 	 	.
i	took	 th 	 is 	 	photo	two	 week 	 s 	 	ago	in	guangzhou	,	and	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	there	was	 noth 	 ing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	of	these	 building 	 s 	 	.
it	was	just	a	much	 small 	 er 	 	city	,	and	the	pace	of	 urban 	 ization 	 	is	 in 	 credible 	 	and	enormous	.
and	we	have	to	understand	these	main	 question 	 s 	 	:	how	do	people	move	through	these	new	urban	 space 	 s 	 	?
how	do	they	share	 the 	 ir 	 	culture	?
how	do	we	tackle	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 mobil 	 ity 	 	?
and	how	can	light	help	there	?
 be 	 cause 	 	the	new	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	they	seem	to	be	in	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	position	to	 con 	 tribute 	 	to	the	 solution 	 s 	 	of	 urban 	 ization 	 	and	to	provide	us	with	better	 environment 	 s 	 	.
it	's	not	that	long	ago	that	our	 light 	 ing 	 	was	just	 d 	 one 	 	with	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 lamp 	 s 	 	.
and	of	course	,	we	had	the	metal	 hal 	 ide 	 	 lamp 	 s 	 	and	fluorescent	 lamp 	 s 	 	and	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	.
now	we	have	led	,	but	here	you	see	the	 lat 	 est 	 	one	,	and	you	see	how	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	small	it	is	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	 off 	 ers 	 	us	a	 un 	 ique 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 tin 	 y 	 	,	 tin 	 y 	 	 s 	 ize 	 	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	put	the	light	 where 	 ver 	 	we	 re 	 ally 	 	need	it	.
and	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	 leav 	 e 	 	it	out	where	it	's	not	 need 	 ed 	 	at	all	and	where	we	can	preserve	 dark 	 ness 	 	.
so	that	is	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 pro 	 position 	 	,	i	think	,	and	a	new	way	of	 light 	 ing 	 	the	 architect 	 ural 	 	environment	with	our	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	in	mind	.
the	problem	is	 th 	 ough 	 	that	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	explain	to	you	how	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 work 	 s 	 	--	but	i	can	have	four	of	these	on	my	finger	,	so	you	would	not	to	be	able	to	 re 	 ally 	 	see	them	.
so	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	our	 labor 	 atory 	 	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	it	,	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	we	can	do	 some 	 thing 	 	.	``
they	 create 	 d 	 	for	me	the	 big 	 gest 	 	led	in	the	world	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	for	 ted 	 x 	 	in	amsterdam	.
so	here	it	is	.
it	's	the	same	thing	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	over	there	--	just	200	 time 	 s 	 	 big 	 ger 	 	.
and	i	will	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	show	you	how	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
so	just	to	explain	.
now	,	every	led	that	is	made	these	 day 	 s 	 	 give 	 s 	 	blue	light	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 ver 	 y 	 	 pleas 	 ant 	 	and	 comfort 	 able 	 	.
and	for	that	reason	,	we	cover	the	led	with	a	phosphor	cap	.
and	the	phosphor	is	 excit 	 ed 	 	by	the	blue	and	 make 	 s 	 	the	light	white	and	warm	and	 pleas 	 ant 	 	.
and	then	when	you	add	the	lens	to	that	,	you	can	 bundl 	 e 	 	the	light	and	 s 	 end 	 	it	to	 where 	 ver 	 	you	need	it	 with 	 out 	 	any	need	to	 s 	 pill 	 	any	light	to	the	sky	or	 any 	 where 	 	else	.
so	you	can	preserve	the	 dark 	 ness 	 	and	make	the	light	.
i	just	 want 	 ed 	 	to	show	that	to	you	so	you	understand	how	 th 	 is 	 	 work 	 s 	 	.
thank	you	.
we	can	go	further	.
so	we	have	to	 re 	 think 	 	the	way	we	light	our	cities	.
we	have	to	think	 aga 	 in 	 	about	light	 a 	 s 	 	a	default	solution	.
why	are	all	these	 motor 	 ways 	 	 permanent 	 ly 	 	lit	?
is	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	?
can	we	 may 	 be 	 	be	much	more	 select 	 ive 	 	and	create	better	 environment 	 s 	 	that	 al 	 so 	 	benefit	from	 dark 	 ness 	 	?
can	we	be	more	gentle	with	light	?
like	here	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	low	light	level	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
can	we	engage	people	more	in	the	 light 	 ing 	 	 project 	 s 	 	that	we	create	,	so	they	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	connect	with	it	,	like	here	?
or	can	we	create	 simpl 	 y 	 	 sculpt 	 ures 	 	that	are	 ver 	 y 	 	inspiring	to	be	in	and	to	be	around	?
and	can	we	preserve	the	 dark 	 ness 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	to	find	a	place	like	 th 	 is 	 	 to 	 day 	 	on	earth	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 challeng 	 ing 	 	.
and	to	find	a	 star 	 ry 	 	sky	like	 th 	 is 	 	is	even	more	difficult	.
even	in	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	,	we	are	creating	a	lot	of	light	that	we	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	ban	 al 	 so 	 	for	animal	life	to	have	a	much	 great 	 er 	 	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	.
and	it	's	known	that	 migr 	 ating 	 	 bird 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	get	 ver 	 y 	 	 dis 	 oriented 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	these	 off 	 shore 	 	 platform 	 s 	 	.
and	we	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	,	when	we	make	 t 	 hose 	 	 light 	 s 	 	green	,	the	 bird 	 s 	 	,	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	go	the	right	way	.
they	are	not	 disturb 	 ed 	 	 any 	 more 	 	.
and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	once	 aga 	 in 	 	that	spectral	 sensitiv 	 ity 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	here	.
in	all	of	these	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	,	i	think	,	we	should	start	making	the	light	out	of	 dark 	 ness 	 	,	and	use	the	 dark 	 ness 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	canvas	--	like	the	visual	 artist 	 s 	 	do	,	like	edward	hopper	in	 th 	 is 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 	.
i	think	that	there	is	a	lot	of	suspense	in	 th 	 is 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 	.
i	think	,	when	i	see	it	,	i	start	to	think	,	who	are	 t 	 hose 	 	people	?
where	have	they	come	from	?	where	are	they	going	?
what	just	 happen 	 ed 	 	?	what	will	be	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	the	next	five	 minute 	 s 	 	?
and	it	 on 	 ly 	 	 embodi 	 es 	 	all	these	 st 	 ories 	 	and	all	 th 	 is 	 	suspense	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 dark 	 ness 	 	and	the	light	.
edward	hopper	was	a	real	master	in	creating	the	 nar 	 ration 	 	by	 work 	 ing 	 	with	light	and	dark	.
and	we	can	learn	from	that	and	create	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	and	inspiring	 architect 	 ural 	 	 environment 	 s 	 	.
we	can	do	that	in	commercial	 space 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	you	can	still	 al 	 so 	 	go	 out 	 side 	 	and	enjoy	the	 great 	 est 	 	show	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	which	is	,	of	course	,	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 it 	 self 	 	.
so	i	give	you	 th 	 is 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	,	 inform 	 ative 	 	image	of	the	sky	,	ranging	from	the	inner	city	,	where	you	may	see	one	or	two	 star 	 s 	 	and	 noth 	 ing 	 	else	,	all	the	way	to	the	 r 	 ural 	 	 environment 	 s 	 	,	where	you	can	enjoy	 th 	 is 	 	great	and	 gorge 	 ous 	 	and	 beaut 	 iful 	 	performance	of	the	 con 	 s 	 tell 	 ations 	 	and	the	 star 	 s 	 	.
in	 architect 	 ure 	 	,	it	 work 	 s 	 	just	the	same	.
by	 appreci 	 ating 	 	the	 dark 	 ness 	 	when	you	design	the	light	,	you	create	much	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	 environment 	 s 	 	that	 tru 	 ly 	 	enhance	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	most	well	-	known	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	tadao	ando	's	church	of	light	.
but	i	 al 	 so 	 	think	of	peter	zumthor	's	 s 	 pa 	 	in	vals	,	where	light	and	dark	,	in	 ver 	 y 	 	gentle	 combination 	 s 	 	,	alter	each	other	to	define	the	space	.
or	richard	mccormack	's	southern	tube	station	in	london	,	where	you	can	 re 	 ally 	 	see	the	sky	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	you	are	under	the	ground	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	i	want	to	point	out	that	a	lot	of	 th 	 is 	 	inspiration	 come 	 s 	 	from	theater	.
and	i	think	it	's	fantastic	that	we	are	 to 	 day 	 	 ex 	 peri 	 encing 	 	 ted 	 x 	 	in	a	theater	for	the	first	time	 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	we	 re 	 ally 	 	owe	to	the	theater	a	big	 thank 	 s 	 	.
it	would	n't	be	 s 	 uch 	 	an	inspiring	 scen 	 ography 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 th 	 is 	 	theater	.
and	i	think	the	theater	is	a	place	where	we	 tru 	 ly 	 	enhance	life	with	light	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
