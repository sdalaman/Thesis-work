one	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 part 	 s 	 	of	my	job	at	the	 gate 	 s 	 	 found 	 ation 	 	is	that	i	get	to	travel	to	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	,	and	when	i	meet	the	 mother 	 s 	 	in	so	 man 	 y 	 	of	these	remote	 place 	 s 	 	,	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 truck 	 	by	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	have	in	common	.
they	want	what	we	want	for	our	children
and	that	is	for	 the 	 ir 	 	children	to	grow	up	 success 	 ful 	 	,	to	be	 health 	 y 	 	,	and	to	have	a	 success 	 ful 	 	life	.
but	i	 al 	 so 	 	see	 lot 	 s 	 	of	poverty	,	and	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	 jar 	 ring 	 	,	both	in	the	scale	and	the	scope	of	it	.
my	first	trip	in	india	,	i	was	in	a	person	's	home	where	they	had	dirt	 floor 	 s 	 	,	no	running	water	,	no	 electric 	 ity 	 	,	and	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	what	i	see	all	over	the	world	.
so	in	short	,	i	'm	 start 	 led 	 	by	all	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	they	do	n't	have	.
but	i	am	 surprise 	 d 	 	by	one	thing	that	they	do	have	:	coca	-	 col 	 a 	 	.
 co 	 ke 	 	is	 every 	 where 	 	.
in	fact	,	when	i	travel	to	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	,	 co 	 ke 	 	 feel 	 s 	 	 ubiqu 	 it 	 ous 	 	.
and	so	when	i	come	back	from	these	 trip 	 s 	 	,	and	i	'm	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 develop 	 ment 	 	,	and	i	'm	 fly 	 ing 	 	home	and	i	'm	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	deliver	 condom 	 s 	 	to	people	or	 vaccin 	 ations 	 	,	``	you	know	,	 co 	 ke 	 	's	success	kind	of	 stop 	 s 	 	and	 make 	 s 	 	you	wonder	:	how	is	it	that	they	can	get	 co 	 ke 	 	to	these	far	-	 f 	 lung 	 	 place 	 s 	 	?
if	they	can	do	that	,	why	ca	n't	 government 	 s 	 	and	ngos	do	the	same	thing	?
and	i	'm	not	the	first	person	to	ask	 th 	 is 	 	question	.
but	i	think	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	community	,	we	still	have	a	lot	to	learn	.
it	's	 stagger 	 ing 	 	,	if	you	think	about	coca	-	 col 	 a 	 	.
they	sell	1.5	billion	 serv 	 ing 	 s 	 	every	single	day	.
that	's	like	every	man	,	woman	and	child	on	the	planet	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	 serv 	 ing 	 	of	 co 	 ke 	 	every	week	.
so	why	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	matter	?
well	,	if	we	're	going	to	speed	up	the	progress	and	go	even	 fast 	 er 	 	on	the	set	of	 mill 	 e 	 nnium 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	 goal 	 s 	 	that	we	're	set	 a 	 s 	 	a	world	,	we	need	to	learn	from	the	 innov 	 ators 	 	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	 innov 	 ators 	 	come	from	every	single	sector	.
i	feel	that	,	if	we	can	understand	what	 make 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	coca	-	 col 	 a 	 	 ubiqu 	 it 	 ous 	 	,	we	can	 app 	 ly 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	then	for	the	public	good	.
 co 	 ke 	 	's	success	is	relevant	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	we	can	 analyz 	 e 	 	it	,	learn	from	it	,	then	we	can	 s 	 ave 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
so	that	's	why	i	took	a	bit	of	time	to	 stud 	 y 	 	 co 	 ke 	 	.
and	i	think	there	are	 re 	 ally 	 	three	 thing 	 s 	 	we	can	take	away	from	coca	-	 col 	 a 	 	.
they	take	real	-	time	data	and	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	feed	it	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	product	.
they	tap	 in 	 to 	 	local	 entrepreneur 	 ial 	 	talent	,	and	they	do	 in 	 credible 	 	 market 	 ing 	 	.
so	let	's	start	with	the	data	.
now	 co 	 ke 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	bottom	line	--
they	report	to	a	set	of	 share 	 holder 	 s 	 	,	they	have	to	turn	a	profit	.
so	they	take	the	data	,	and	they	use	it	to	measure	progress	.
they	have	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 continu 	 ous 	 	 feed 	 back 	 	loop	.
they	learn	 some 	 thing 	 	,	they	put	it	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	product	,	they	put	it	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	market	.
they	have	a	whole	team	 call 	 ed 	 	``	knowledge	and	 in 	 sight 	 	.	``
it	's	a	lot	like	other	consumer	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.
so	if	you	're	running	namibia	for	coca	-	 col 	 a 	 	,	and	you	have	a	107	 constit 	 u 	 encies 	 	,	you	know	where	every	can	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	bottle	of	sprite	,	fanta	or	 co 	 ke 	 	was	 s 	 old 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	was	a	corner	store	,	a	 super 	 market 	 	or	a	 push 	 cart 	 	.
so	if	 sale 	 s 	 	start	to	drop	,	then	the	person	can	identify	the	problem	and	address	the	issue	.
let	's	contrast	that	for	a	minute	to	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
in	 develop 	 ment 	 	,	the	 evalu 	 ation 	 	 come 	 s 	 	at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	end	of	the	project	.
i	've	 s 	 at 	 	in	a	lot	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	,
and	by	then	,	it	is	way	too	late	to	use	the	data	.
i	had	 some 	 body 	 	from	an	ngo	once	 de 	 scribe 	 	it	to	me	 a 	 s 	 	 bowl 	 ing 	 	in	the	dark	.
they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	roll	the	ball	,	you	hear	some	 pin 	 s 	 	go	down	.
it	's	dark	,	you	ca	n't	see	which	one	 go 	 es 	 	down	 un 	 til 	 	the	 light 	 s 	 	come	on	,	and	then	you	an	see	your	impact	.	``
real	-	time	data	 turn 	 s 	 	on	the	 light 	 s 	 	.
so	what	's	the	second	thing	that	 co 	 ke 	 	's	good	at	?
they	're	good	at	 tap 	 ping 	 	 in 	 to 	 	that	local	 entrepreneur 	 ial 	 	talent	.
 co 	 ke 	 	's	 be 	 en 	 	in	africa	since	1928	,	but	most	of	the	time	they	could	n't	reach	the	 di 	 stant 	 	 market 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	had	a	system	that	was	a	lot	like	in	the	 develop 	 ed 	 	world	,	which	was	a	large	truck	 roll 	 ing 	 	down	the	street	.
and	in	africa	,	the	remote	 place 	 s 	 	,	it	's	hard	to	find	a	good	road	.
but	 co 	 ke 	 	 notice 	 d 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	--
they	 notice 	 d 	 	that	local	people	 we 	 re 	 	taking	the	product	,	 buy 	 ing 	 	it	in	bulk	and	then	 re 	 selling 	 	it	in	these	hard	-	to	-	reach	 place 	 s 	 	.
and	so	they	took	a	bit	of	time	to	learn	about	that	.
and	they	 decide 	 d 	 	in	1990	that	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	start	training	the	local	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	,	giving	them	small	 loan 	 s 	 	.
they	set	them	up	 a 	 s 	 	what	they	 call 	 ed 	 	micro	-	 distribut 	 ion 	 	 center 	 s 	 	,
and	 t 	 hose 	 	local	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	then	hire	 sale 	 s 	 	people	,	who	go	out	with	 bi 	 cycle 	 s 	 	and	 push 	 cart 	 s 	 	and	 wheelbarrow 	 s 	 	to	sell	the	product	.
there	are	now	some	3,000	of	these	 center 	 s 	 	 employ 	 ing 	 	about	15,000	people	in	africa	.
in	tanzania	and	uganda	,	they	represent	90	percent	of	 co 	 ke 	 	's	 sale 	 s 	 	.
let	's	look	at	the	 develop 	 ment 	 	side	.
what	is	it	that	 government 	 s 	 	and	ngos	can	learn	from	 co 	 ke 	 	?
 government 	 s 	 	and	ngos	need	to	tap	 in 	 to 	 	that	local	 entrepreneur 	 ial 	 	talent	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 local 	 s 	 	know	how	to	reach	the	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	-	to	-	serve	 place 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 neighbor 	 s 	 	,	and	they	know	what	 motiv 	 ates 	 	them	to	make	change	.
i	think	a	great	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	ethiopia	's	new	health	 extens 	 ion 	 	program	.
the	government	 notice 	 d 	 	in	ethiopia	that	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	people	 we 	 re 	 	so	far	away	from	a	health	clinic	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	over	a	day	's	travel	away	from	a	health	clinic	.
so	if	you	're	in	an	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	--	or	if	you	're	a	mom	about	to	deliver	a	baby	--	forget	it	,	to	get	to	the	health	care	center	.
they	 decide 	 d 	 	that	was	n't	good	 en 	 ough 	 	,	so	they	went	to	india	and	 stud 	 ied 	 	the	indian	state	of	kerala	that	 al 	 so 	 	had	a	system	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	they	 adapt 	 ed 	 	it	for	ethiopia	.
and	in	2003	,	the	government	of	ethiopia	 start 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	new	system	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	country	.
they	trained	35,000	health	 extens 	 ion 	 	 work 	 ers 	 	to	deliver	care	 direct 	 ly 	 	to	the	people	.
in	just	five	 year 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	ratio	went	from	one	 work 	 er 	 	for	every	30,000	people	to	one	 work 	 er 	 	for	every	2,500	people	.
now	,	think	about	how	 th 	 is 	 	can	change	people	's	 live 	 s 	 	.
health	 extens 	 ion 	 	 work 	 ers 	 	can	help	with	so	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	family	 plan 	 ning 	 	,	 pre 	 natal 	 	care	,	 immun 	 ization 	 s 	 	for	the	children	,	or	 ad 	 vis 	 ing 	 	the	woman	to	get	to	the	 facil 	 ity 	 	on	time	for	an	on	-	time	 deliver 	 y 	 	.
that	is	 hav 	 ing 	 	real	impact	in	a	country	like	ethiopia	,	and	it	's	why	you	see	 the 	 ir 	 	child	 mortal 	 ity 	 	 number 	 s 	 	coming	down	25	percent	from	2000	to	2008	.
in	ethiopia	,	there	are	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	children	living	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	health	 extens 	 ion 	 	 work 	 er 	 	program	.
so	what	's	the	next	step	for	ethiopia	?
well	,	they	're	 al 	 ready 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	talk	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
they	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	talk	about	,	``	how	do	you	have	the	health	community	 work 	 ers 	 	generate	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 idea 	 s 	 	?
how	do	you	 in 	 cent 	 	them	based	on	the	impact	that	they	're	 get 	 ting 	 	out	in	 t 	 hose 	 	remote	 village 	 s 	 	?	``
that	's	how	you	tap	 in 	 to 	 	local	 entrepreneur 	 ial 	 	talent	and	you	 un 	 lock 	 	people	's	potential	.
the	third	component	of	 co 	 ke 	 	's	success	is	 market 	 ing 	 	.
 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	 co 	 ke 	 	's	success	 depend 	 s 	 	on	one	 cruci 	 al 	 	fact	and	that	is	that	people	want	a	coca	-	 col 	 a 	 	.
now	the	reason	these	micro	-	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	can	sell	or	make	a	profit	is	they	have	to	sell	every	single	bottle	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 push 	 cart 	 	or	 the 	 ir 	 	wheelbarrow	.
so	,	they	 re 	 ly 	 	on	coca	-	 col 	 a 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 it 	 s 	 	 market 	 ing 	 	,
and	what	's	the	secret	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 market 	 ing 	 	?
well	,	it	's	 aspir 	 ation 	 al 	 	.
it	is	 associate 	 d 	 	that	product	with	a	kind	of	life	that	people	want	to	live	.
so	even	 th 	 ough 	 	it	's	a	global	company	,	they	take	a	 ver 	 y 	 	local	approach	.
 co 	 ke 	 	's	global	campaign	slogan	is	``	open	happiness	.	``
but	they	 local 	 ize 	 	it	.
and	they	do	n't	just	guess	what	 make 	 s 	 	people	happy	;	they	go	to	 place 	 s 	 	like	latin	america	and	they	 real 	 ize 	 	that	happiness	there	is	 associate 	 d 	 	with	family	life	.
and	in	south	africa	,	they	associate	happiness	with	 s 	 er 	 iti 	 	or	community	respect	.
now	,	that	 play 	 ed 	 	 it 	 self 	 	out	in	the	world	cup	campaign	.
let	's	listen	to	 th 	 is 	 	song	that	 co 	 ke 	 	 create 	 d 	 	for	it	,	``	wavin	'	flag	``	by	a	somali	hip	hop	artist	.
k'naan	:	♫	oh	oh	oh	oh	oh	o	-	oh	♫	♫	oh	oh	oh	oh	oh	oh	oh	oh	oh	oh	♫	♫	oh	oh	oh	oh	oh	o	-	oh	♫	♫	oh	oh	oh	oh	oh	oh	oh	oh	o	-	oh	♫	♫give	you	 free 	 dom 	 	,	give	you	fire♫	♫	give	you	reason	,	take	you	 high 	 er 	 	♫	♫	see	the	 champion 	 s 	 	take	the	field	now	♫	♫	you	define	us	,	make	us	feel	proud	♫	♫	in	the	 street 	 s 	 	our	 head 	 s 	 	are	 lift 	 ed 	 	♫	♫	 a 	 s 	 	we	lose	our	 inhibit 	 ion 	 	♫	♫	 celebr 	 ation 	 	,	it	's	around	us	♫	♫	every	nation	,	all	around	us	♫	melinda	french	 gate 	 s 	 	:	it	 feel 	 s 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	,	right	?
well	,	they	did	n't	stop	there	--
they	 local 	 ized 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	18	different	 language 	 s 	 	.
and	it	went	number	one	on	the	pop	chart	in	17	 count 	 ries 	 	.
it	 re 	 mind 	 s 	 	me	of	a	song	that	i	remember	from	my	 child 	 hood 	 	,	``	i	'd	like	to	teach	the	world	to	 s 	 ing 	 	,	``	that	 al 	 so 	 	went	number	one	on	the	pop	 chart 	 s 	 	.
both	 song 	 s 	 	have	 some 	 thing 	 	in	common	:	that	same	appeal	of	 celebr 	 ation 	 	and	 un 	 ity 	 	.
so	how	 do 	 es 	 	health	and	 develop 	 ment 	 	market	?
well	,	it	's	based	on	 avoid 	 ance 	 	,	not	 aspir 	 ations 	 	.
i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	you	've	heard	some	of	these	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	.
``	use	a	condom	,	do	n't	get	 aid 	 s 	 	.	``
``	wash	you	 hand 	 s 	 	,	you	might	not	get	 dia 	 rrhea 	 	.	``
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	sound	 any 	 thing 	 	like	``	wavin	'	flag	``	to	me	.
and	i	think	we	make	a	fundamental	 mistak 	 e 	 	--	we	make	an	assumption	,	that	we	think	that	,	if	people	need	 some 	 thing 	 	,	we	do	n't	have	to	make	them	want	that	.
and	i	think	that	's	a	 mistak 	 e 	 	.
and	there	's	some	 indic 	 ations 	 	around	the	world	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	 start 	 ing 	 	to	change	.
one	 ex 	 ample 	 	is	 sanit 	 ation 	 	.
we	know	that	a	million	and	a	half	children	die	a	year	from	 dia 	 rrhea 	 	and	a	lot	of	it	is	 be 	 cause 	 	of	open	 defec 	 ation 	 	.
but	there	's	a	solution	:	you	build	a	toilet	.
but	what	we	're	 find 	 ing 	 	around	the	world	,	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	,	is	,	if	you	build	a	toilet	and	you	 leav 	 e 	 	it	there	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	get	used	.
people	 re 	 use 	 	it	for	a	 s 	 lab 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	home	.
they	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	store	grain	in	it	.
i	've	even	 s 	 een 	 	it	used	for	a	chicken	 co 	 op 	 	.
but	what	 do 	 es 	 	 market 	 ing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 en 	 tail 	 	that	would	make	a	 sanit 	 ation 	 	solution	get	a	result	in	 dia 	 rrhea 	 	?
well	,	you	work	with	the	community	.
you	start	to	talk	to	them	about	why	open	 defec 	 ation 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	should	n't	be	 d 	 one 	 	in	the	village	,	and	they	agree	to	that	.
but	then	you	take	the	toilet	and	you	position	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	modern	,	 trend 	 y 	 	convenience	.
one	state	in	 north 	 ern 	 	india	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	so	far	 a 	 s 	 	to	link	 toilet 	 s 	 	to	 court 	 ship 	 	.
and	it	 work 	 s 	 	--	look	at	these	 head 	 lines 	 	.
i	'm	not	 kid 	 d 	 ing 	 	.
women	are	 re 	 fusing 	 	to	marry	men	 with 	 out 	 	 toilet 	 s 	 	.
no	loo	,	no	``	i	do	.	``
now	,	it	's	not	just	a	funny	 head 	 line 	 	--
it	's	 innov 	 ative 	 	.	it	's	an	 innov 	 ative 	 	 market 	 ing 	 	campaign	.
but	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	it	 s 	 ave 	 s 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
take	a	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	--
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	room	full	of	young	men	and	my	husband	,	bill	.
and	can	you	guess	what	the	young	men	are	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	?
they	're	 wait 	 ing 	 	to	be	 circum 	 cis 	 ed 	 	.
can	you	you	 believ 	 e 	 	that	?
we	know	that	 circum 	 cis 	 ion 	 	 reduc 	 es 	 	hiv	 infect 	 ion 	 	by	60	percent	in	men	.
and	when	we	first	heard	 th 	 is 	 	result	 in 	 side 	 	the	 found 	 ation 	 	,	i	have	to	admit	,	bill	and	i	 we 	 re 	 	 scratch 	 ing 	 	our	 head 	 s 	 	a	little	bit	and	we	 we 	 re 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	but	who	's	going	to	volunteer	for	 th 	 is 	 	procedure	?	``
but	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	the	men	do	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 hear 	 ing 	 	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 girlfriend 	 s 	 	that	they	prefer	it	,	and	the	men	 al 	 so 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	it	 improve 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 s 	 ex 	 	life	.
so	if	we	can	start	to	understand	what	people	 re 	 ally 	 	want	in	health	and	 develop 	 ment 	 	,	we	can	change	 commun 	 ities 	 	and	we	can	change	whole	 nation 	 s 	 	.
well	,	why	is	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	so	 import 	 ant 	 	?
so	let	's	talk	about	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	 th 	 is 	 	all	 come 	 s 	 	together	,	when	you	tie	the	three	 thing 	 s 	 	together	.
and	 poli 	 o 	 	,	i	think	,	is	one	of	the	most	 power 	 ful 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
we	've	 s 	 een 	 	a	99	percent	 r 	 eduction 	 	in	 poli 	 o 	 	in	20	 year 	 s 	 	.
so	if	you	look	back	to	1988	,	there	are	about	350,000	 case 	 s 	 	of	 poli 	 o 	 	on	the	planet	that	year	.
in	2009	,	we	're	down	to	1,600	 case 	 s 	 	.
well	how	did	that	happen	?
let	's	look	at	a	country	like	india	.
they	have	over	a	billion	people	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	,	but	they	have	35,000	local	 doctor 	 s 	 	who	report	 para 	 lysis 	 	,	and	 clinic 	 ians 	 	,	a	huge	 report 	 ing 	 	system	in	 chemist 	 s 	 	.
they	have	two	and	a	half	million	 vaccin 	 ators 	 	.
but	let	me	make	the	story	a	little	bit	more	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	for	you	.
let	me	tell	you	the	story	of	shriram	,	an	18	month	boy	in	bihar	,	a	 north 	 ern 	 	state	in	india	.
 th 	 is 	 	year	on	august	8th	,	he	felt	 para 	 lysis 	 	and	on	the	13th	,	his	 parent 	 s 	 	took	him	to	the	doctor	.
on	august	14th	and	15th	,	they	took	a	 s 	 tool 	 	 s 	 ample 	 	,	and	by	the	25th	of	august	,	it	was	 confirm 	 ed 	 	he	had	type	1	 poli 	 o 	 	.
by	august	30th	,	a	genetic	test	was	 d 	 one 	 	,	and	we	 k 	 new 	 	what	 s 	 train 	 	of	 poli 	 o 	 	shriram	had	.
now	it	could	have	come	from	one	of	two	 place 	 s 	 	.
it	could	have	come	from	nepal	,	just	to	the	north	,	 a 	 cross 	 	the	border	,	or	from	jharkhand	,	a	state	just	to	the	south	.
 luck 	 ily 	 	,	the	genetic	 test 	 ing 	 	 prov 	 ed 	 	that	,	in	fact	,	 th 	 is 	 	strand	came	north	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	had	it	come	from	the	south	,	it	would	have	had	a	much	 wide 	 r 	 	impact	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 trans 	 mission 	 	.
so	 man 	 y 	 	more	people	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	 affect 	 ed 	 	.
so	what	's	the	 end 	 game 	 	?
well	on	september	4th	,	there	was	a	huge	mop	-	up	campaign	,	which	is	what	you	do	in	 poli 	 o 	 	.
they	went	out	and	where	shriram	 live 	 s 	 	,	they	 vaccin 	 ated 	 	two	million	people	.
so	in	less	than	a	month	,	we	went	from	one	case	of	 para 	 lysis 	 	to	a	 target 	 ed 	 	 vaccin 	 ation 	 	program	.
and	i	'm	happy	to	say	 on 	 ly 	 	one	other	person	in	that	area	got	 poli 	 o 	 	.
that	's	how	you	keep	a	huge	 out 	 break 	 	from	 spread 	 ing 	 	,	and	it	 show 	 s 	 	what	can	happen	when	local	people	have	the	data	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	;	they	can	 s 	 ave 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
now	one	of	the	 challeng 	 es 	 	in	 poli 	 o 	 	,	still	,	is	 market 	 ing 	 	,	but	it	might	not	be	what	you	think	.
it	's	not	the	 market 	 ing 	 	on	the	ground	.
it	's	not	 tell 	 ing 	 	the	 parent 	 s 	 	,	``	if	you	see	 para 	 lysis 	 	,	take	your	child	to	the	doctor	or	get	your	child	 vaccin 	 ated 	 	.	``
we	have	a	problem	with	 market 	 ing 	 	in	the	donor	community	.
the	g	8	 nation 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 gen 	 er 	 ous 	 	on	 poli 	 o 	 	over	the	last	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	but	we	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	have	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 poli 	 o 	 	fatigue	and	that	is	that	the	donor	 nation 	 s 	 	are	n't	 will 	 ing 	 	to	fund	 poli 	 o 	 	any	 long 	 er 	 	.
so	by	next	summer	,	we	're	 sight 	 ed 	 	to	run	out	of	money	on	 poli 	 o 	 	.
so	we	are	99	percent	of	the	way	there	on	 th 	 is 	 	goal	and	we	're	about	to	run	short	of	money	.
and	i	think	that	if	the	 market 	 ing 	 	 we 	 re 	 	more	 aspir 	 ation 	 al 	 	,	if	we	could	focus	 a 	 s 	 	a	community	on	how	far	we	've	come	and	how	 amaz 	 ing 	 	it	would	be	to	 eradic 	 ate 	 	 th 	 is 	 	disease	,	we	could	put	 poli 	 o 	 	fatigue	and	 poli 	 o 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	us	.
and	if	we	could	do	that	,	we	could	stop	 vaccin 	 ating 	 	 every 	 body 	 	,	 world 	 wide 	 	,	in	all	of	our	 count 	 ries 	 	for	 poli 	 o 	 	.
and	it	would	 on 	 ly 	 	be	the	second	disease	ever	 wipe 	 d 	 	off	the	face	of	the	planet	.
and	we	are	so	close	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 vict 	 ory 	 	is	so	possible	.
so	if	 co 	 ke 	 	's	 market 	 ers 	 	came	to	me	and	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	to	define	happiness	,	i	'd	say	my	vision	of	happiness	is	a	mother	 hold 	 ing 	 	 health 	 y 	 	baby	in	her	 arm 	 s 	 	.
to	me	,	that	is	deep	happiness	.
and	so	if	we	can	learn	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	from	the	 innov 	 ators 	 	in	every	sector	,	then	in	the	future	we	make	together	,	that	happiness	can	be	just	 a 	 s 	 	 ubiqu 	 it 	 ous 	 	 a 	 s 	 	coca	-	 col 	 a 	 	.
thank	you	.
