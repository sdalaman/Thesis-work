what	about	a	life	?
what	you	see	here	is	a	 pre 	 mature 	 	baby	.
he	 look 	 s 	 	like	he	's	 rest 	 ing 	 	 peace 	 fully 	 	,	but	in	fact	he	's	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	to	stay	 al 	 ive 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	he	ca	n't	 regulat 	 e 	 	his	own	body	temperature	.
 th 	 is 	 	baby	is	so	 tin 	 y 	 	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	 en 	 ough 	 	fat	on	his	body	to	stay	warm	.
 s 	 ad 	 ly 	 	,	20	million	 bab 	 ies 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	are	born	every	year	around	the	world	.
four	million	of	these	 bab 	 ies 	 	die	 annual 	 ly 	 	.
but	the	 big 	 ger 	 	problem	is	that	the	 one 	 s 	 	who	do	 surviv 	 e 	 	grow	up	with	severe	,	long	-	term	health	 problem 	 s 	 	.
the	reason	is	 be 	 cause 	 	in	the	first	month	of	a	baby	's	life	,	 it 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	job	is	to	grow	.
if	it	's	 batt 	 ling 	 	 hypo 	 ther 	 mia 	 	,	 it 	 s 	 	 organ 	 s 	 	ca	n't	develop	 normal 	 ly 	 	,	 result 	 ing 	 	in	a	range	of	health	 problem 	 s 	 	from	diabetes	,	to	heart	disease	,	to	low	i.q	.
imagine	:	 man 	 y 	 	of	these	 problem 	 s 	 	could	be	 prevent 	 ed 	 	if	these	 bab 	 ies 	 	 we 	 re 	 	just	 ke 	 pt 	 	warm	.
that	is	the	 prim 	 ary 	 	function	of	an	 incub 	 ator 	 	.
but	 tradition 	 al 	 	 incub 	 ators 	 	 requir 	 e 	 	 electric 	 ity 	 	and	cost	up	to	20	thousand	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
so	,	you	're	not	going	to	find	them	in	 r 	 ural 	 	 area 	 s 	 	of	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	result	,	 parent 	 s 	 	resort	to	local	 solution 	 s 	 	like	 ty 	 ing 	 	hot	water	 bottle 	 s 	 	around	 the 	 ir 	 	 bab 	 ies 	 	'	bodies	,	or	placing	them	under	light	 bulb 	 s 	 	like	the	 one 	 s 	 	you	see	here	--	 method 	 s 	 	that	are	both	 in 	 effective 	 	and	 un 	 safe 	 	.
i	've	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 first 	 hand 	 	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	.
on	one	of	my	first	 trip 	 s 	 	to	india	,	i	met	 th 	 is 	 	young	woman	,	sevitha	,	who	had	just	 give 	 n 	 	birth	to	a	 tin 	 y 	 	 pre 	 mature 	 	baby	,	rani	.
she	took	her	baby	to	the	 near 	 est 	 	village	clinic	,	and	the	doctor	 advise 	 d 	 	her	to	take	rani	to	a	city	hospital	so	she	could	be	 place 	 d 	 	in	an	 incub 	 ator 	 	.
but	that	hospital	was	over	four	 hour 	 s 	 	away	,
and	sevitha	did	n't	have	the	 mean 	 s 	 	to	get	there	,	so	her	baby	 di 	 ed 	 	.
inspired	by	 th 	 is 	 	story	,	and	 dozen 	 s 	 	of	other	similar	 st 	 ories 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	my	team	and	i	 real 	 ized 	 	what	was	 need 	 ed 	 	was	a	local	solution	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	could	work	 with 	 out 	 	 electric 	 ity 	 	,	that	was	simple	 en 	 ough 	 	for	a	mother	or	a	 mid 	 wife 	 	to	use	,	 give 	 n 	 	that	the	 major 	 ity 	 	of	 birth 	 s 	 	still	take	place	in	the	home	.
we	 need 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	was	 port 	 able 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	could	be	 steril 	 ized 	 	and	 re 	 used 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	 multi 	 ple 	 	 bab 	 ies 	 	and	 some 	 thing 	 	ultra	-	low	-	cost	,	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	the	20,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	that	an	 incub 	 ator 	 	in	the	u.s.	 cost 	 s 	 	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	came	up	with	.
what	you	see	here	 look 	 s 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	like	an	 incub 	 ator 	 	.	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	small	 sleep 	 ing 	 	bag	for	a	baby	.
you	can	open	it	up	 complete 	 ly 	 	.	it	's	 water 	 proof 	 	.
there	's	no	 seam 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	so	you	can	 steril 	 ize 	 	it	 ver 	 y 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	.
but	the	magic	is	in	 th 	 is 	 	 po 	 uch 	 	of	wax	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	phase	-	change	material	.
it	's	a	wax	-	like	 sub 	 stance 	 	with	a	 melt 	 ing 	 	point	of	human	body	temperature	,	37	 degree 	 s 	 	celsius	.
you	can	melt	 th 	 is 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	using	hot	water	and	then	when	it	 melt 	 s 	 	it	's	able	to	maintain	one	constant	temperature	for	four	to	six	 hour 	 s 	 	at	a	time	,	after	which	you	 simpl 	 y 	 	 re 	 heat 	 	the	 po 	 uch 	 	.
so	,	you	then	place	it	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	little	pocket	back	here	,	and	it	 create 	 s 	 	a	warm	micro	-	environment	for	the	baby	.
 look 	 s 	 	simple	,	but	we	've	 reiterate 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 dozen 	 s 	 	of	 time 	 s 	 	by	going	 in 	 to 	 	the	field	to	talk	to	 doctor 	 s 	 	,	 mom 	 s 	 	and	 clinic 	 ians 	 	to	ensure	that	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 meet 	 s 	 	the	 need 	 s 	 	of	the	local	 commun 	 ities 	 	.
we	plan	to	launch	 th 	 is 	 	product	in	india	in	2010	,
and	the	target	price	point	will	be	25	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	less	than	0.1	percent	of	the	cost	of	a	 tradition 	 al 	 	 incub 	 ator 	 	.
over	the	next	five	 year 	 s 	 	we	hope	to	 s 	 ave 	 	the	 live 	 s 	 	of	 al 	 most 	 	a	million	 bab 	 ies 	 	.
but	the	 long 	 er 	 	-	term	social	impact	is	a	 r 	 eduction 	 	in	population	growth	.
 th 	 is 	 	 seem 	 s 	 	 counter 	 intuitive 	 	,	but	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	 a 	 s 	 	infant	 mortal 	 ity 	 	is	 reduc 	 ed 	 	,	population	 s 	 ize 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 de 	 crease 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	do	n't	need	to	 anticip 	 ate 	 	that	 the 	 ir 	 	 bab 	 ies 	 	are	going	to	die	.
we	hope	that	the	embrace	infant	 warm 	 er 	 	and	other	simple	 innov 	 ations 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	represent	a	new	trend	for	the	future	of	technology	:	simple	,	 local 	 ized 	 	,	 afford 	 able 	 	 solution 	 s 	 	that	have	the	potential	to	make	huge	social	impact	.
in	 design 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	we	 follow 	 ed 	 	a	few	 bas 	 ic 	 	 principle 	 s 	 	.
we	 re 	 ally 	 	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	understand	the	end	user	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	people	like	sevitha	.
we	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	understand	the	root	of	the	problem	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 be 	 ing 	 	 bias 	 ed 	 	by	what	 al 	 ready 	 	 exist 	 s 	 	.
and	then	we	thought	of	the	most	simple	solution	we	could	to	address	 th 	 is 	 	problem	.
in	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	we	can	 tru 	 ly 	 	 br 	 ing 	 	technology	to	the	 masse 	 s 	 	.
and	we	can	 s 	 ave 	 	 million 	 s 	 	of	 live 	 s 	 	through	the	simple	 warm 	 th 	 	of	an	embrace	.
