 human 	 s 	 	in	the	 develop 	 ed 	 	world	 s 	 pend 	 	more	than	90	percent	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	 in 	 door 	 s 	 	,	where	they	breathe	in	and	come	 in 	 to 	 	contact	with	 trillion 	 s 	 	of	life	 form 	 s 	 	 in 	 visible 	 	to	the	naked	eye	:	 micro 	 organism 	 s 	 	.
 building 	 s 	 	are	complex	 eco 	 system 	 s 	 	that	are	an	 import 	 ant 	 	source	of	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	that	are	good	for	us	,	and	some	that	are	bad	for	us	.
what	 determine 	 s 	 	the	 type 	 s 	 	and	 distribut 	 ions 	 	of	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	 in 	 door 	 s 	 	?
 building 	 s 	 	are	 colon 	 ized 	 	by	 air 	 borne 	 	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	that	enter	through	 window 	 s 	 	and	through	 mechanic 	 al 	 	 ventil 	 ation 	 	 system 	 s 	 	.
and	they	are	 br 	 ought 	 	 in 	 side 	 	by	 human 	 s 	 	and	other	 creature 	 s 	 	.
the	fate	of	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	 in 	 door 	 s 	 	 depend 	 s 	 	on	complex	 interact 	 ions 	 	with	 human 	 s 	 	,	and	with	the	human	-	built	environment	.
and	 to 	 day 	 	,	 architect 	 s 	 	and	 biologist 	 s 	 	are	 work 	 ing 	 	together	to	explore	smart	building	design	that	will	create	 health 	 y 	 	 building 	 s 	 	for	us	.
we	 s 	 pend 	 	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	amount	of	time	in	 building 	 s 	 	that	are	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	controlled	 environment 	 s 	 	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	building	here	--	 environment 	 s 	 	that	have	 mechanic 	 al 	 	 ventil 	 ation 	 	 system 	 s 	 	that	include	 filter 	 ing 	 	,	 heat 	 ing 	 	and	air	 condition 	 ing 	 	.
 give 	 n 	 	the	amount	of	time	that	we	 s 	 pend 	 	 in 	 door 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	understand	how	 th 	 is 	 	 affect 	 s 	 	our	health	.
at	the	biology	and	the	built	environment	center	,	we	carried	out	a	 stud 	 y 	 	in	a	hospital	where	we	 s 	 ampl 	 ed 	 	air	and	 pull 	 ed 	 	the	dna	out	of	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	in	the	air	.
and	we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	three	different	 type 	 s 	 	of	rooms	.
we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	rooms	that	 we 	 re 	 	 mechanic 	 ally 	 	 ventil 	 ated 	 	,	which	are	the	data	 point 	 s 	 	in	the	blue	.
we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	rooms	that	 we 	 re 	 	 natural 	 ly 	 	 ventil 	 ated 	 	,	where	the	hospital	let	us	turn	off	the	 mechanic 	 al 	 	 ventil 	 ation 	 	in	a	wing	of	the	building	and	pry	open	the	 window 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	no	 long 	 er 	 	 oper 	 able 	 	,
but	they	made	them	 oper 	 able 	 	for	our	 stud 	 y 	 	.
and	we	 al 	 so 	 	 s 	 ampl 	 ed 	 	the	 out 	 door 	 	air	.
if	you	look	at	the	x	-	axis	of	 th 	 is 	 	graph	,	you	'll	see	that	what	we	 common 	 ly 	 	want	to	do	--	which	is	 keep 	 ing 	 	the	 out 	 door 	 s 	 	out	--	we	 accomplish 	 ed 	 	that	with	 mechanic 	 al 	 	 ventil 	 ation 	 	.
so	if	you	look	at	the	green	data	 point 	 s 	 	,	which	is	air	that	's	 out 	 side 	 	,	you	'll	see	that	there	's	a	large	amount	of	 micro 	 bi 	 al 	 	 divers 	 ity 	 	,	or	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 micro 	 bi 	 al 	 	 type 	 s 	 	.
but	if	you	look	at	the	blue	data	 point 	 s 	 	,	which	is	 mechanic 	 ally 	 	 ventil 	 ated 	 	air	,	it	's	not	 a 	 s 	 	 divers 	 e 	 	.
but	 be 	 ing 	 	less	 divers 	 e 	 	is	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	good	for	our	health	.
if	you	look	at	the	y	-	axis	of	 th 	 is 	 	graph	,	you	'll	see	that	,	in	the	 mechanic 	 ally 	 	 ventil 	 ated 	 	air	,	you	have	a	 high 	 er 	 	 prob 	 ability 	 	of	 en 	 counter 	 ing 	 	a	potential	pathogen	,	or	germ	,	than	if	you	're	 out 	 door 	 s 	 	.
so	to	understand	why	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	case	,	we	took	our	data	and	put	it	 in 	 to 	 	an	 ordin 	 ation 	 	 dia 	 gram 	 	,	which	is	a	 statistic 	 al 	 	map	that	 tell 	 s 	 	you	 some 	 thing 	 	about	how	related	the	 micro 	 bi 	 al 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	are	in	the	different	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
the	data	 point 	 s 	 	that	are	 close 	 r 	 	together	have	 micro 	 bi 	 al 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	that	are	more	similar	than	data	 point 	 s 	 	that	are	far	 a 	 part 	 	.
and	the	first	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	can	see	from	 th 	 is 	 	graph	is	,	if	you	look	at	the	blue	data	 point 	 s 	 	,	which	are	the	 mechanic 	 ally 	 	 ventil 	 ated 	 	air	,	they	're	not	 simpl 	 y 	 	a	 sub 	 set 	 	of	the	green	data	 point 	 s 	 	,	which	are	the	 out 	 door 	 	air	.
what	we	've	found	is	that	 mechanic 	 ally 	 	 ventil 	 ated 	 	air	 look 	 s 	 	like	 human 	 s 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	on	it	that	are	 common 	 ly 	 	 associate 	 d 	 	with	our	skin	and	with	our	mouth	,	our	 s 	 pit 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	all	 constant 	 ly 	 	 shed 	 d 	 ing 	 	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	.
so	all	of	you	right	now	are	sharing	your	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	with	one	 an 	 other 	 	.
and	when	you	're	 out 	 door 	 s 	 	,	that	type	of	air	 ha 	 s 	 	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	that	are	 common 	 ly 	 	 associate 	 d 	 	with	plant	 leav 	 es 	 	and	with	dirt	.
why	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	matter	?
it	 matter 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	health	care	industry	is	the	second	most	energy	intensive	industry	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
 hospital 	 s 	 	use	two	and	a	half	 time 	 s 	 	the	amount	of	energy	 a 	 s 	 	 off 	 ice 	 	 building 	 s 	 	.
and	the	model	that	we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	with	in	 hospital 	 s 	 	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	with	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	different	 building 	 s 	 	,	is	to	keep	the	 out 	 door 	 s 	 	out	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	model	may	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	be	the	best	for	our	health	.
and	 give 	 n 	 	the	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	amount	of	nosocomial	 infect 	 ions 	 	,	or	hospital	-	 acquir 	 ed 	 	 infect 	 ions 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	clue	that	it	's	a	good	time	to	 re 	 consider 	 	our	current	 practice 	 s 	 	.
so	just	 a 	 s 	 	we	manage	national	 park 	 s 	 	,	where	we	promote	the	growth	of	some	species	and	we	inhibit	the	growth	of	 other 	 s 	 	,	we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 building 	 s 	 	using	an	 eco 	 system 	 	 frame 	 work 	 	where	we	can	promote	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	that	we	want	to	have	 in 	 door 	 s 	 	.
i	've	heard	 some 	 body 	 	say	that	you	're	 a 	 s 	 	 health 	 y 	 	 a 	 s 	 	your	gut	.
and	for	 th 	 is 	 	reason	,	 man 	 y 	 	people	eat	 pro 	 biotic 	 	yogurt	so	they	can	promote	a	 health 	 y 	 	gut	 flor 	 a 	 	.
and	what	we	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	want	to	do	is	to	be	able	to	use	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 cept 	 	to	promote	a	 health 	 y 	 	group	of	 micro 	 organism 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	.
thank	you	.
