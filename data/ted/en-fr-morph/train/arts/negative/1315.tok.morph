there	's	 current 	 ly 	 	over	a	thousand	tedtalks	on	the	ted	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
and	i	guess	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	here	think	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	 quit 	 e 	 	fantastic	--	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	me	.	i	do	n't	agree	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	think	we	have	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	here	.
 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	think	about	it	,	1,000	tedtalks	,	that	's	over	1,000	 idea 	 s 	 	worth	 spread 	 ing 	 	.
how	on	earth	are	you	going	to	spread	a	thousand	 idea 	 s 	 	?
even	if	you	just	try	to	get	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	your	head	by	 watch 	 ing 	 	all	 t 	 hose 	 	thousand	ted	 video 	 s 	 	,	it	would	 actual 	 ly 	 	 current 	 ly 	 	take	you	over	250	 hour 	 s 	 	to	do	so	.
and	i	did	a	little	 calcul 	 ation 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
the	damage	to	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	for	each	one	who	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	around	$	15,000	.
so	 hav 	 ing 	 	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	danger	to	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	i	thought	,	we	need	to	find	a	solution	to	 th 	 is 	 	problem	.
here	's	my	approach	to	it	all	.
if	you	look	at	the	current	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	you	have	a	thousand	tedtalks	.
each	of	 t 	 hose 	 	tedtalks	 ha 	 s 	 	an	average	length	of	about	2,300	 word 	 s 	 	.
now	take	 th 	 is 	 	together	and	you	end	up	with	2.3	million	 word 	 s 	 	of	tedtalks	,	which	is	about	three	 b 	 ible 	 s 	 	-	worth	of	content	.
the	obvious	question	here	is	,	 do 	 es 	 	a	tedtalk	 re 	 ally 	 	need	2,300	 word 	 s 	 	?
is	n't	there	 some 	 thing 	 	 short 	 er 	 	?
i	mean	,	if	you	have	an	idea	worth	 spread 	 ing 	 	,	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	you	can	put	it	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 short 	 er 	 	than	2,300	 word 	 s 	 	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	question	is	,	how	short	can	you	get	?
what	's	the	 minim 	 um 	 	amount	of	 word 	 s 	 	you	would	need	to	do	a	tedtalk	?
while	i	was	 ponder 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	question	,	i	came	 a 	 cross 	 	 th 	 is 	 	urban	legend	about	ernest	hemingway	,	who	 alle 	 ged 	 ly 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	that	these	six	 word 	 s 	 	here	:	``	for	sale	:	baby	 shoe 	 s 	 	,	never	worn	,	``	 we 	 re 	 	the	best	novel	he	had	ever	written	.
and	i	 al 	 so 	 	 en 	 counter 	 ed 	 	a	project	 call 	 ed 	 	six	-	word	 memoir 	 s 	 	where	people	 we 	 re 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	take	your	whole	life	and	 pleas 	 e 	 	sum	 th 	 is 	 	up	 in 	 to 	 	six	 word 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	these	here	:	``	found	true	love	,	married	 some 	 one 	 	else	.	``	or	``	living	in	existential	vacuum	;	it	 suck 	 s 	 	.	``	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	like	that	one	.
so	if	a	novel	can	be	put	 in 	 to 	 	six	 word 	 s 	 	and	a	whole	memoir	can	be	put	 in 	 to 	 	six	 word 	 s 	 	,	you	do	n't	need	more	than	six	 word 	 s 	 	for	a	tedtalk	.
we	could	have	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	by	lunch	here	.
i	mean	...
and	if	you	did	 th 	 is 	 	for	all	thousand	tedtalks	,	you	would	get	from	2.3	million	 word 	 s 	 	down	to	6,000	.
so	i	thought	 th 	 is 	 	was	 quit 	 e 	 	 worth 	 while 	 	.
so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	all	my	 friend 	 s 	 	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	take	your	 favor 	 ite 	 	tedtalk	and	put	that	 in 	 to 	 	six	 word 	 s 	 	.
so	here	are	some	of	the	 result 	 s 	 	that	i	 receiv 	 ed 	 	.	i	think	they	're	 quit 	 e 	 	nice	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	dan	pink	's	talk	on	 motiv 	 ation 	 	,	which	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	if	you	have	n't	 s 	 een 	 	it	:	``	drop	carrot	.	drop	stick	.	 br 	 ing 	 	meaning	.	``	it	's	what	he	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	in	 t 	 hose 	 	18	and	a	half	 minute 	 s 	 	.
or	some	even	 include 	 d 	 	 re 	 ference 	 s 	 	to	the	 speaker 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	nathan	myhrvold	's	 s 	 peaking 	 	style	,	or	the	one	of	tim	ferriss	,	which	might	be	 consider 	 ed 	 	a	bit	 st 	 ren 	 uous 	 	at	 time 	 s 	 	.
the	 challeng 	 e 	 	here	is	,	if	i	try	to	 system 	 at 	 ically 	 	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	would	 prob 	 ably 	 	end	up	with	a	lot	of	 summ 	 aries 	 	,	but	not	with	 man 	 y 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	in	the	end	.
so	i	had	to	find	a	different	method	,	 prefer 	 ably 	 	 in 	 vol 	 v 	 ing 	 	total	 strange 	 rs 	 	.
and	 luck 	 ily 	 	there	's	a	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	for	that	 call 	 ed 	 	 mechanic 	 al 	 	turk	,	which	is	a	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	where	you	can	post	 task 	 s 	 	that	you	do	n't	want	to	do	 your 	 self 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	``	 pleas 	 e 	 	summarize	 th 	 is 	 	text	for	me	in	six	 word 	 s 	 	.	``
and	i	did	n't	allow	any	low	-	cost	 count 	 ries 	 	to	work	on	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	i	found	out	i	could	get	a	six	-	word	 summ 	 ary 	 	for	just	10	 cent 	 s 	 	,	which	i	think	is	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	price	.
even	then	,	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	not	possible	to	summarize	each	tedtalk	 individual 	 ly 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	do	the	math	,	you	have	a	thousand	tedtalks	,	the	pay	10	 cent 	 s 	 	each	;	you	have	to	do	more	than	one	 summ 	 ary 	 	for	each	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 talk 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	some	of	them	will	 prob 	 ably 	 	be	,	or	are	,	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	.
so	i	would	end	up	 pay 	 ing 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
so	i	thought	of	a	different	way	by	 think 	 ing 	 	,	well	,	the	 talk 	 s 	 	 r 	 evolve 	 	around	certain	 theme 	 s 	 	.
so	what	if	i	do	n't	let	people	summarize	individual	tedtalks	to	six	 word 	 s 	 	,	but	give	them	10	tedtalks	at	the	same	time	and	say	,	``	 pleas 	 e 	 	do	a	six	-	word	 summ 	 ary 	 	for	that	one	.	``	i	would	cut	my	 cost 	 s 	 	by	90	percent	.
so	for	$	60	,	i	could	summarize	a	thousand	tedtalks	 in 	 to 	 	just	600	 summ 	 aries 	 	,	which	would	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	 quit 	 e 	 	nice	.
now	some	of	you	might	 actual 	 ly 	 	right	now	be	 think 	 ing 	 	,	it	's	 down 	 right 	 	crazy	to	have	10	tedtalks	 summarize 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	just	six	 word 	 s 	 	.
but	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	not	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	by	 statistic 	 s 	 	professor	,	hans	rosling	.
i	guess	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	have	 s 	 een 	 	one	or	more	of	his	 talk 	 s 	 	.
he	's	got	eight	 talk 	 s 	 	 on 	 line 	 	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	 talk 	 s 	 	can	 bas 	 ically 	 	be	 summ 	 ed 	 	up	 in 	 to 	 	just	four	 word 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	all	he	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	 show 	 ing 	 	us	,	our	 intuit 	 ion 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	.
he	 al 	 ways 	 	 prove 	 s 	 	us	wrong	.
so	people	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	some	did	n't	do	so	well	.
i	mean	,	when	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	to	summarize	the	10	tedtalks	at	the	same	time	,	some	took	the	easy	route	out	.
they	just	had	some	general	comment	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	 other 	 s 	 	,	and	i	found	 th 	 is 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 cheek 	 y 	 	.	they	used	 the 	 ir 	 	six	 word 	 s 	 	to	talk	back	to	me	and	ask	me	if	i	'd	 be 	 en 	 	too	much	on	google	 late 	 ly 	 	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	 al 	 so 	 	,	i	never	 under 	 stood 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	some	people	 re 	 ally 	 	came	up	with	 the 	 ir 	 	own	version	of	the	truth	.
i	do	n't	know	any	tedtalk	that	 contain 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	,	oh	well	.	in	the	end	,	 how 	 ever 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	,	for	each	of	 t 	 hose 	 	10	tedtalk	 cluster 	 s 	 	that	i	 submit 	 ted 	 	,	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	 receiv 	 ed 	 	 meaning 	 ful 	 	 summ 	 aries 	 	.
here	are	some	of	my	 favor 	 ites 	 	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	for	all	the	tedtalks	around	food	,	 some 	 one 	 	 summ 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	up	 in 	 to 	 	:	``	food	 sha 	 ping 	 	body	,	 brain 	 s 	 	and	environment	,	``	which	i	think	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	.
or	happiness	:	``	 striv 	 ing 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	happiness	=	moving	 to 	 ward 	 	 un 	 happiness 	 	.	``
so	here	i	was	.
i	had	 start 	 ed 	 	out	with	a	thousand	tedtalks	and	i	had	600	six	-	word	 summ 	 aries 	 	for	 t 	 hose 	 	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	it	 sound 	 ed 	 	nice	in	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	but	when	you	look	at	600	 summ 	 aries 	 	,	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	a	lot	.
it	's	a	huge	list	.
so	i	thought	,	i	 prob 	 ably 	 	have	to	take	 th 	 is 	 	one	step	further	here	and	create	 summ 	 aries 	 	of	the	 summ 	 aries 	 	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	i	did	.
so	i	took	the	600	 summ 	 aries 	 	that	i	had	,	put	them	 in 	 to 	 	nine	 group 	 s 	 	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	the	 rating 	 s 	 	that	the	 talk 	 s 	 	had	 original 	 ly 	 	 receiv 	 ed 	 	on	ted.com	and	 ask 	 ed 	 	people	to	do	 summ 	 aries 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	some	 mis 	 understand 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	when	i	had	a	cluster	of	all	the	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 talk 	 s 	 	,	 some 	 one 	 	thought	i	was	just	 try 	 ing 	 	to	find	the	ultimate	pick	-	up	line	.
but	in	the	end	,	 amaz 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	people	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	do	it	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	all	the	 courage 	 ous 	 	tedtalks	:	``	people	 dy 	 ing 	 	,	``	or	``	people	 suffer 	 ing 	 	,	``	was	 al 	 so 	 	one	,	``	with	easy	 solution 	 s 	 	around	.	``
or	the	recipe	for	the	ultimate	jaw	-	dropping	tedtalk	:	``	flickr	 photo 	 s 	 	of	 inter 	 galactic 	 	 classic 	 al 	 	 compose 	 r 	 	.	``
i	mean	that	's	the	 es 	 s 	 ence 	 	of	it	all	.
now	i	had	my	nine	 group 	 s 	 	,	but	,	i	mean	,	it	's	 al 	 ready 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	a	 r 	 eduction 	 	.
but	of	course	,	once	you	are	that	far	,	you	're	not	 re 	 ally 	 	satisfied	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	go	all	the	way	,	all	the	way	down	the	 distill 	 ery 	 	,	 start 	 ing 	 	out	with	a	thousand	tedtalks	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	have	a	thousand	tedtalks	 summarize 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	just	six	 word 	 s 	 	--	which	would	be	a	99.9997	percent	 r 	 eduction 	 	in	content	.
and	i	would	 on 	 ly 	 	pay	$	99.50	--	so	stay	even	 be 	 low 	 	a	hundred	 dollar 	 s 	 	for	it	.
so	i	had	50	 over 	 all 	 	 summ 	 aries 	 	 d 	 one 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	time	i	paid	25	 cent 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	thought	the	task	was	a	bit	 hard 	 er 	 	.
and	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	when	i	first	 receiv 	 ed 	 	the	 answer 	 s 	 	--	and	here	you	'll	see	six	of	the	 answer 	 s 	 	--	i	was	a	bit	 disappoint 	 ed 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	you	'll	agree	,	they	all	summarize	some	 a 	 spect 	 	of	ted	,	but	to	me	they	felt	a	bit	 b 	 land 	 	,	or	they	just	had	a	certain	 a 	 spect 	 	of	ted	in	them	.
so	i	was	 al 	 most 	 	ready	to	give	up	when	one	night	i	 play 	 ed 	 	around	with	these	 sentence 	 s 	 	and	found	out	that	there	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	solution	in	here	.
so	here	it	is	,	a	crowd	-	sourced	,	six	-	word	 summ 	 ary 	 	of	a	thousand	tedtalks	at	the	value	of	$	99.50	:	``	why	the	worry	?	i	'd	 ra 	 ther 	 	wonder	.	``	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
