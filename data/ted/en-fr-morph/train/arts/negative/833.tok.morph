in	the	spirit	of	jacques	cousteau	,	who	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	people	protect	what	they	love	,	``	i	want	to	share	with	you	 to 	 day 	 	what	i	love	most	in	the	ocean	,	and	that	's	the	 in 	 credible 	 	number	and	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 animal 	 s 	 	in	it	that	make	light	.
my	 addict 	 ion 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	strange	looking	 div 	 ing 	 	suit	 call 	 ed 	 	wasp	;
that	's	not	an	acronym	--	just	 some 	 body 	 	thought	it	 look 	 ed 	 	like	the	insect	.
it	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	for	use	by	the	 off 	 shore 	 	oil	industry	for	 div 	 ing 	 	on	oil	 rig 	 s 	 	down	to	a	depth	of	2,000	feet	.
right	after	i	 complete 	 d 	 	my	ph.d.	,	i	was	 luck 	 y 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	to	be	 include 	 d 	 	with	a	group	of	 scientist 	 s 	 	that	was	using	it	for	the	first	time	 a 	 s 	 	a	tool	for	ocean	exploration	.
we	trained	in	a	tank	in	port	hueneme	,
and	then	my	first	open	ocean	 d 	 ive 	 	was	in	santa	barbara	channel	.
it	was	an	 even 	 ing 	 	 d 	 ive 	 	.
i	went	down	to	a	depth	of	880	feet	and	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	the	 light 	 s 	 	.
and	the	reason	i	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	the	 light 	 s 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 k 	 new 	 	i	would	see	 th 	 is 	 	 phenomen 	 on 	 	of	 animal 	 s 	 	making	light	 call 	 ed 	 	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nce 	 	.
but	i	was	 total 	 ly 	 	 un 	 prepared 	 	for	how	much	there	was	and	how	spectacular	it	was	.
i	saw	 chain 	 s 	 	of	 jelly 	 fish 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 siphon 	 ophores 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 long 	 er 	 	than	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	 pump 	 ing 	 	out	so	much	light	that	i	could	read	the	 dial 	 s 	 	and	 gauge 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	the	suit	 with 	 out 	 	a	 flash 	 light 	 	;	and	 puff 	 s 	 	and	 bill 	 ow 	 s 	 	of	what	 look 	 ed 	 	like	 lumin 	 ous 	 	blue	smoke	;	and	 explosion 	 s 	 	of	 spark 	 s 	 	that	would	swirl	up	out	of	the	 thrust 	 ers 	 	--	just	like	when	you	throw	a	log	on	a	 camp 	 fire 	 	and	the	 emb 	 ers 	 	swirl	up	off	the	 camp 	 fire 	 	,	but	these	 we 	 re 	 	 ic 	 y 	 	,	blue	 emb 	 ers 	 	.
it	was	 breath 	 taking 	 	.
now	,	 usual 	 ly 	 	if	people	are	familiar	with	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nce 	 	at	all	,	it	's	these	 guy 	 s 	 	;	it	's	 fire 	 flies 	 	.
and	there	are	a	few	other	land	-	dwellers	that	can	make	light	--	some	 insect 	 s 	 	,	 earth 	 worm 	 s 	 	,	fungi	--
but	in	general	,	on	land	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	rare	.
in	the	ocean	,	it	's	the	rule	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	the	exception	.
if	i	go	out	in	the	open	ocean	environment	,	 virtual 	 ly 	 	 any 	 where 	 	in	the	world	,	and	i	drag	a	net	from	3,000	feet	to	the	surface	,	most	of	the	 animal 	 s 	 	--	in	fact	,	in	 man 	 y 	 	 place 	 s 	 	,	80	to	90	percent	of	the	 animal 	 s 	 	that	i	 br 	 ing 	 	up	in	that	net	--	make	light	.
 th 	 is 	 	 make 	 s 	 	for	some	 pre 	 tty 	 	spectacular	light	 show 	 s 	 	.
now	i	want	to	share	with	you	a	little	video	that	i	shot	from	a	submersible	.
i	first	 develop 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 techni 	 que 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	from	a	little	single	-	person	submersible	 call 	 ed 	 	deep	 r 	 over 	 	and	then	 adapt 	 ed 	 	it	for	use	on	the	johnson	sea	-	link	,	which	you	see	here	.
so	,	 mount 	 ed 	 	in	front	of	the	 observ 	 ation 	 	sphere	,	there	's	a	a	three	-	foot	 dia 	 meter 	 	hoop	with	a	screen	 stretch 	 ed 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	it	.
and	 in 	 side 	 	the	sphere	with	me	is	an	 intens 	 ified 	 	camera	that	's	about	 a 	 s 	 	sensitive	 a 	 s 	 	a	fully	dark	-	 adapt 	 ed 	 	human	eye	,	albeit	a	little	 fuzz 	 y 	 	.
so	you	turn	on	the	camera	,	turn	out	the	 light 	 s 	 	.
that	 spark 	 le 	 	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	is	not	 luminesce 	 nce 	 	,	that	's	just	 electron 	 ic 	 	noise	on	these	super	 intens 	 ified 	 	 camera 	 s 	 	.
you	do	n't	see	 luminesce 	 nce 	 	 un 	 til 	 	the	submersible	 begin 	 s 	 	to	move	forward	through	the	water	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	it	 do 	 es 	 	,	 animal 	 s 	 	 bump 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	screen	are	 stimul 	 ated 	 	to	 bio 	 luminesce 	 	.
now	,	when	i	was	first	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	all	i	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	was	count	the	 number 	 s 	 	of	 source 	 s 	 	.
i	 k 	 new 	 	my	forward	speed	,	i	 k 	 new 	 	the	area	,
and	so	i	could	figure	out	how	 man 	 y 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 source 	 s 	 	there	 we 	 re 	 	per	cubic	meter	.
but	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	i	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	identify	 animal 	 s 	 	by	the	type	of	 flash 	 es 	 	they	 produce 	 d 	 	.
and	so	,	here	,	in	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	of	maine	at	740	feet	,	i	can	name	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 every 	 thing 	 	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	there	to	the	species	level	.	like	 t 	 hose 	 	big	 explosion 	 s 	 	,	 spark 	 s 	 	,	are	from	a	little	comb	jelly	,
and	there	's	 k 	 r 	 ill 	 	and	other	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 crustacean 	 s 	 	,	and	 jelly 	 fish 	 	.
there	was	 an 	 other 	 	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	comb	 j 	 elli 	 es 	 	.
and	so	i	've	 work 	 ed 	 	with	computer	image	analysis	 engineer 	 s 	 	to	develop	 autom 	 atic 	 	 re 	 cognition 	 	 system 	 s 	 	that	can	identify	these	 animal 	 s 	 	and	then	 ex 	 tract 	 	the	xyz	coordinate	of	the	 initi 	 al 	 	impact	point	.
and	we	can	then	do	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 ecologist 	 s 	 	do	on	land	,	and	do	 near 	 est 	 	neighbor	 distance 	 s 	 	.
but	you	do	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	have	to	go	down	to	the	 depth 	 s 	 	of	the	ocean	to	see	a	light	show	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	it	in	surface	 water 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	some	shot	,	by	dr.	 mi 	 ke 	 	latz	at	scripps	institution	,	of	a	dolphin	 swimm 	 ing 	 	through	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nt 	 	plankton	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	 some 	 place 	 	 ex 	 otic 	 	like	one	of	the	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nt 	 	 ba 	 y 	 s 	 	in	puerto	rico	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	shot	in	san	diego	harbor	.
and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	you	can	see	it	even	 close 	 r 	 	than	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 head 	 s 	 	on	 ship 	 s 	 	--	that	's	 toilet 	 s 	 	,	for	any	land	 lover 	 s 	 	that	are	 listen 	 ing 	 	--	are	 flush 	 ed 	 	with	 un 	 filter 	 ed 	 	 sea 	 water 	 	that	often	 ha 	 s 	 	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nt 	 	plankton	in	it	.	so	,	if	you	stagger	 in 	 to 	 	the	head	late	at	night	and	you	're	so	toilet	-	 hugg 	 ing 	 	sick	that	you	forget	to	turn	on	the	light	,	you	may	think	that	you	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	religious	experience	.
so	,	how	 do 	 es 	 	a	living	creature	make	light	?
well	,	that	was	the	question	that	19th	century	french	 phy 	 s 	 io 	 logist 	 	raphael	dubois	,	 ask 	 ed 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nt 	 	clam	.
he	ground	it	up	and	he	 manage 	 d 	 	to	get	out	a	couple	of	 chemical 	 s 	 	;	one	,	the	enzyme	,	he	 call 	 ed 	 	luciferase	;	the	substrate	,	he	 call 	 ed 	 	luciferin	after	lucifer	the	lightbearer	.
that	 term 	 in 	 ology 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 tuck 	 	,	but	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	refer	to	specific	 chemical 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	these	 chemical 	 s 	 	come	in	a	lot	of	different	 shape 	 s 	 	and	 form 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	most	of	the	people	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nce 	 	 to 	 day 	 	are	focused	on	the	 chemist 	 ry 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	these	 chemical 	 s 	 	have	 prov 	 ed 	 	so	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 valu 	 able 	 	for	 develop 	 ing 	 	 anti 	 bacterial 	 	 agent 	 s 	 	,	cancer	 fight 	 ing 	 	 drug 	 s 	 	,	 test 	 ing 	 	for	the	presence	of	life	on	mars	,	 detect 	 ing 	 	 pollutant 	 s 	 	in	our	 water 	 s 	 	--	which	is	how	we	use	it	at	orca	.
in	2008	,	the	 no 	 bel 	 	prize	in	 chemist 	 ry 	 	was	 a 	 ward 	 ed 	 	for	work	 d 	 one 	 	on	a	molecule	 call 	 ed 	 	green	fluorescent	protein	that	was	 isolate 	 d 	 	from	the	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nt 	 	 chemist 	 ry 	 	of	a	 jelly 	 fish 	 	,	and	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 equate 	 d 	 	to	the	 invent 	 ion 	 	of	the	 micro 	 scope 	 	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	impact	that	it	 ha 	 s 	 	had	on	cell	biology	and	genetic	 engineer 	 ing 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	thing	all	these	 molecule 	 s 	 	are	 tell 	 ing 	 	us	that	,	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	,	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nce 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	at	 l 	 east 	 	40	 time 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 a 	 s 	 	50	 separat 	 e 	 	 time 	 s 	 	in	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	which	is	a	clear	 indic 	 ation 	 	of	how	 spectacular 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 th 	 is 	 	trait	is	for	 surviv 	 al 	 	.
so	,	what	is	it	about	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nce 	 	that	's	so	 import 	 ant 	 	to	so	 man 	 y 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	?
well	,	for	 animal 	 s 	 	that	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	avoid	 predator 	 s 	 	by	 stay 	 ing 	 	in	the	 dark 	 ness 	 	,	light	can	still	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	for	the	three	 bas 	 ic 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 animal 	 s 	 	have	to	do	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	:	and	that	's	find	food	,	attract	a	mate	and	avoid	 be 	 ing 	 	eaten	.
so	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	fish	 ha 	 s 	 	a	built	-	in	 head 	 light 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	 it 	 s 	 	eye	that	it	can	use	for	 find 	 ing 	 	food	or	 attract 	 ing 	 	a	mate	.
and	then	when	it	's	not	using	it	,	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	can	roll	it	down	 in 	 to 	 	 it 	 s 	 	head	just	like	the	 head 	 light 	 s 	 	on	your	lamborghini	.
 th 	 is 	 	fish	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	high	 beam 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	fish	,	which	is	one	of	my	 favor 	 ites 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	three	 head 	 light 	 s 	 	on	each	side	of	 it 	 s 	 	head	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	one	is	blue	,	and	that	's	the	color	of	most	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nce 	 	in	the	ocean	 be 	 cause 	 	evolution	 ha 	 s 	 	 select 	 ed 	 	for	the	color	that	 travel 	 s 	 	 far 	 th 	 est 	 	through	 sea 	 water 	 	in	order	to	optimize	communication	.
so	,	most	 animal 	 s 	 	make	blue	light	,	and	most	 animal 	 s 	 	can	 on 	 ly 	 	see	blue	light	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	fish	is	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 fasci 	 nating 	 	exception	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	two	red	light	 organ 	 s 	 	.
and	i	have	no	idea	why	there	's	two	,	and	that	's	 some 	 thing 	 	i	want	to	solve	some	day	--
but	not	 on 	 ly 	 	can	it	see	blue	light	,	but	it	can	see	red	light	.
so	it	uses	 it 	 s 	 	red	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nce 	 	like	a	 snip 	 er 	 	's	scope	to	be	able	to	sneak	up	on	 animal 	 s 	 	that	are	blind	to	red	light	and	be	able	to	see	them	 with 	 out 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 een 	 	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	got	a	little	chin	 barb 	 el 	 	here	with	a	blue	 luminesce 	 nt 	 	lure	on	it	that	it	can	use	to	attract	 pre 	 y 	 	from	a	long	way	off	.
and	a	lot	of	 animal 	 s 	 	will	use	 the 	 ir 	 	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nce 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	lure	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	one	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	fish	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 viper 	 fish 	 	,	and	it	's	got	a	lure	on	the	end	of	a	long	 fish 	 ing 	 	rod	that	it	 arche 	 s 	 	in	front	of	the	 tooth 	 y 	 	jaw	that	 give 	 s 	 	the	 viper 	 fish 	 	 it 	 s 	 	name	.
the	 tee 	 th 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	fish	are	so	long	that	if	they	closed	 in 	 side 	 	the	mouth	of	the	fish	,	it	would	 actual 	 ly 	 	 im 	 pale 	 	 it 	 s 	 	own	brain	.
so	 in 	 stead 	 	,	it	 slide 	 s 	 	in	 groove 	 s 	 	on	the	 out 	 side 	 	of	the	head	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	christmas	tree	of	a	fish	;
 every 	 thing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	fish	 light 	 s 	 	up	,
it	's	not	just	that	lure	.	it	's	got	a	built	-	in	 flash 	 light 	 	.
it	's	got	these	jewel	-	like	light	 organ 	 s 	 	on	 it 	 s 	 	 bel 	 ly 	 	that	it	uses	for	a	type	of	camouflage	that	 oblite 	 rates 	 	 it 	 s 	 	shadow	,	so	when	it	's	 swimm 	 ing 	 	around	and	there	's	a	predator	looking	up	from	 be 	 low 	 	,	it	 make 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	disappear	.
it	's	got	light	 organ 	 s 	 	in	the	mouth	,
it	's	got	light	 organ 	 s 	 	in	every	single	scale	,	in	the	 fin 	 s 	 	,	in	a	 mu 	 cus 	 	layer	on	the	back	and	the	 bel 	 ly 	 	,	all	used	for	different	 thing 	 s 	 	--	some	of	which	we	know	about	,	some	of	which	we	do	n't	.
and	we	know	a	little	bit	more	about	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nce 	 	 thank 	 s 	 	to	pixar	,	and	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	 grat 	 e 	 ful 	 	to	pixar	for	sharing	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 top 	 ic 	 	with	so	 man 	 y 	 	people	.
i	do	wish	,	with	 the 	 ir 	 	budget	,	that	they	might	have	 s 	 pent 	 	just	a	 tin 	 y 	 	bit	more	money	to	pay	a	 consult 	 ing 	 	fee	to	some	poor	,	 starv 	 ing 	 	graduate	student	,	who	could	have	told	them	that	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	 eye 	 s 	 	of	a	fish	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	 preserve 	 d 	 	in	 form 	 al 	 in 	 	.
these	are	the	 eye 	 s 	 	of	a	living	 angle 	 r 	 fish 	 	.
so	,	she	's	got	a	lure	that	she	 stick 	 s 	 	out	in	front	of	 th 	 is 	 	living	 mouse 	 trap 	 	of	needle	-	sharp	 tee 	 th 	 	in	order	to	attract	in	some	 un 	 suspect 	 ing 	 	 pre 	 y 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	one	 ha 	 s 	 	a	lure	with	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	little	 interest 	 ing 	 	 th 	 read 	 s 	 	coming	off	it	.
now	we	used	to	think	that	the	different	shape	of	the	lure	was	to	attract	different	 type 	 s 	 	of	 pre 	 y 	 	,	but	then	stomach	content	analyses	on	these	fish	 d 	 one 	 	by	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	or	more	 like 	 ly 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	graduate	 student 	 s 	 	,	have	 reveal 	 ed 	 	that	they	all	eat	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	the	same	thing	.
so	,	now	we	 believ 	 e 	 	that	the	different	shape	of	the	lure	is	how	the	male	 recogn 	 ize 	 s 	 	the	female	in	the	 angle 	 r 	 fish 	 	world	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 man 	 y 	 	of	these	 male 	 s 	 	are	what	are	known	 a 	 s 	 	dwarf	 male 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	little	guy	 ha 	 s 	 	no	visible	 mean 	 s 	 	of	self	-	support	.
he	 ha 	 s 	 	no	lure	for	 attract 	 ing 	 	food	and	no	 tee 	 th 	 	for	eating	it	when	it	 get 	 s 	 	there	.
his	 on 	 ly 	 	hope	for	 exist 	 ence 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	is	 a 	 s 	 	a	 gig 	 olo 	 	.
he	's	got	to	find	 him 	 self 	 	a	 bab 	 e 	 	and	then	he	's	got	to	latch	on	for	life	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	little	guy	 ha 	 s 	 	found	 him 	 self 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 bab 	 e 	 	,	and	you	will	note	that	he	's	had	the	good	sense	to	attach	 him 	 self 	 	in	a	way	that	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	to	look	at	her	.
but	he	still	 know 	 s 	 	a	good	thing	when	he	 s 	 ees 	 	it	,	and	so	he	 seal 	 s 	 	the	relationship	with	an	 e 	 ternal 	 	kiss	.
his	 fl 	 esh 	 	 fuse 	 s 	 	with	her	 fl 	 esh 	 	,	her	 blood 	 stream 	 	 grow 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	his	body	,	and	he	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	more	than	a	little	 s 	 perm 	 	sac	.
well	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	deep	-	sea	version	of	women	's	lib	.
she	 al 	 ways 	 	 know 	 s 	 	where	he	is	,	and	she	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	to	be	 mono 	 gam 	 ous 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	some	of	these	 female 	 s 	 	come	up	with	 multi 	 ple 	 	 male 	 s 	 	 attach 	 ed 	 	.
so	they	can	use	it	for	 find 	 ing 	 	food	,	for	 attract 	 ing 	 	 mate 	 s 	 	.
they	use	it	a	lot	for	defense	,	 man 	 y 	 	different	ways	.
a	lot	of	them	can	 re 	 lease 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	luciferin	or	luferase	in	the	water	just	the	way	a	 s 	 quid 	 	or	an	 oct 	 opus 	 	will	 re 	 lease 	 	an	ink	cloud	.
 th 	 is 	 	shrimp	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 spew 	 ing 	 	light	out	of	 it 	 s 	 	mouth	like	a	fire	 breath 	 ing 	 	dragon	in	order	to	blind	or	distract	 th 	 is 	 	 viper 	 fish 	 	so	that	the	shrimp	can	swim	away	 in 	 to 	 	the	 dark 	 ness 	 	.
and	there	are	a	lot	of	different	 animal 	 s 	 	that	can	do	 th 	 is 	 	:
there	's	 jelly 	 fish 	 	,	there	's	 s 	 quid 	 	,	there	's	a	whole	lot	of	different	 crustacean 	 s 	 	,
there	's	even	fish	that	can	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	fish	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 shin 	 ing 	 	 tube 	 shoulder 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	tube	on	 it 	 s 	 	shoulder	that	can	squirt	out	light	.
and	i	was	luck	 en 	 ough 	 	to	capture	one	of	these	when	we	 we 	 re 	 	on	a	 trawl 	 ing 	 	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 	off	the	 north 	 west 	 	coast	of	africa	for	``	blue	planet	,	``	for	the	deep	 port 	 ion 	 	of	``	blue	planet	.	``
and	we	 we 	 re 	 	using	a	special	 trawl 	 ing 	 	net	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	 br 	 ing 	 	these	 animal 	 s 	 	up	 al 	 ive 	 	.
so	we	 capture 	 d 	 	one	of	these	,	and	i	 br 	 ought 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	the	lab	.
so	i	'm	 hold 	 ing 	 	it	,	and	i	'm	about	to	touch	that	tube	on	 it 	 s 	 	shoulder	,	and	when	i	do	,	you	'll	see	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nce 	 	coming	out	.
but	to	me	,	what	's	 shock 	 ing 	 	is	not	just	the	amount	of	light	,	but	the	fact	that	it	's	not	just	luciferin	and	luciferase	.
for	 th 	 is 	 	fish	,	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	whole	 cell 	 s 	 	with	nuclei	and	 membrane 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 energ 	 et 	 ically 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 cost 	 ly 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	fish	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	we	have	no	idea	why	it	 do 	 es 	 	it	--
 an 	 other 	 	one	of	these	great	 myster 	 ies 	 	that	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 solve 	 d 	 	.
now	,	 an 	 other 	 	form	of	defense	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	a	burglar	alarm	--
same	reason	you	have	a	burglar	alarm	on	your	car	;
the	 hon 	 king 	 	horn	and	 flash 	 ing 	 	 light 	 s 	 	are	 me 	 ant 	 	to	attract	the	attention	of	,	 hope 	 fully 	 	,	the	police	that	will	come	and	take	the	burglar	away	--
when	an	animal	's	caught	in	the	 clutch 	 es 	 	of	a	predator	,	 it 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	hope	for	 es 	 cape 	 	may	be	to	attract	the	attention	of	 some 	 thing 	 	 big 	 ger 	 	and	 na 	 s 	 tier 	 	that	will	attack	 the 	 ir 	 	 attack 	 er 	 	,	 there 	 by 	 	 afford 	 ing 	 	them	a	chance	for	 es 	 cape 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 jelly 	 fish 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	a	spectacular	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nt 	 	 dis 	 play 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	us	chasing	it	in	the	submersible	.
that	's	not	 luminesce 	 nce 	 	,	that	's	 reflect 	 ed 	 	light	from	the	 gon 	 ad 	 s 	 	.
we	capture	it	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	special	 de 	 vice 	 	on	the	front	of	the	submersible	that	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	 br 	 ing 	 	it	up	in	 re 	 ally 	 	 pr 	 ist 	 ine 	 	condition	,	 br 	 ing 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	the	lab	on	the	ship	.
and	then	to	generate	the	 dis 	 play 	 	you	're	about	to	see	,	all	i	did	was	touch	it	once	per	second	on	 it 	 s 	 	nerve	ring	with	a	sharp	pick	that	's	sort	of	like	the	sharp	tooth	of	a	fish	.
and	once	 th 	 is 	 	 dis 	 play 	 	 get 	 s 	 	going	,	i	'm	not	 touch 	 ing 	 	it	 any 	 more 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	light	show	.
it	's	 th 	 is 	 	 pin 	 wheel 	 	of	light	,
and	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	 calcul 	 ations 	 	that	show	that	 th 	 is 	 	could	be	 s 	 een 	 	from	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	300	feet	away	by	a	predator	.
and	i	thought	,	``	you	know	,	that	might	 actual 	 ly 	 	make	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	lure	.	``
 be 	 cause 	 	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	's	 frust 	 rated 	 	me	 a 	 s 	 	a	deep	-	sea	 explore 	 r 	 	is	how	 man 	 y 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	there	 prob 	 ably 	 	are	in	the	ocean	that	we	know	 noth 	 ing 	 	about	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	way	we	explore	the	ocean	.
the	 prim 	 ary 	 	way	that	we	know	about	what	 live 	 s 	 	in	the	ocean	is	we	go	out	and	drag	 net 	 s 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	 ship 	 s 	 	.
and	i	defy	you	to	name	any	other	branch	of	science	that	still	 depend 	 s 	 	on	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	year	-	old	technology	.
the	other	 prim 	 ary 	 	way	is	we	go	down	with	 submersible 	 s 	 	and	remote	-	 oper 	 ated 	 	 vehicle 	 s 	 	.
i	've	made	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 div 	 es 	 	in	 submersible 	 s 	 	.
when	i	'm	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	a	submersible	 th 	 ough 	 	,	i	know	that	i	'm	not	 un 	 obt 	 rus 	 ive 	 	at	all	--
i	've	got	bright	 light 	 s 	 	and	noisy	 thrust 	 ers 	 	--
any	animal	with	any	sense	is	going	to	be	long	gone	.
so	,	i	've	 want 	 ed 	 	for	a	long	time	to	figure	out	a	different	way	to	explore	.
and	so	,	 some 	 time 	 	ago	,	i	got	 th 	 is 	 	idea	for	a	camera	system	.
it	's	not	 exact 	 ly 	 	rocket	science	.	we	call	 th 	 is 	 	thing	eye	-	in	-	the	-	sea	.
and	 scientist 	 s 	 	have	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	on	land	for	 year 	 s 	 	;	we	just	use	a	color	that	the	 animal 	 s 	 	ca	n't	see	and	then	a	camera	that	can	see	that	color	.
you	ca	n't	use	 infra 	 red 	 	in	the	sea	.
we	use	far	-	red	light	,	but	even	that	's	a	problem	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 get 	 s 	 	 absorb 	 ed 	 	so	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
made	an	 intens 	 ified 	 	camera	,	 want 	 ed 	 	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	 electron 	 ic 	 	 jelly 	 fish 	 	.
thing	is	,	in	science	,	you	 bas 	 ically 	 	have	to	tell	the	 fund 	 ing 	 	 age 	 ncies 	 	what	you	're	going	to	discover	before	they	'll	give	you	the	money	.
and	i	did	n't	know	what	i	was	going	to	discover	,	so	i	could	n't	get	the	 fund 	 ing 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	i	 klug 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	together	,	i	got	the	harvey	mudd	 engineer 	 ing 	 	clinic	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	it	 a 	 s 	 	an	 under 	 graduate 	 	student	project	 initi 	 ally 	 	,	and	then	i	 klug 	 ed 	 	 fund 	 ing 	 	from	a	whole	bunch	of	different	 source 	 s 	 	.
monterey	 ba 	 y 	 	 aqua 	 rium 	 	research	institute	 g 	 ave 	 	me	time	with	 the 	 ir 	 	rov	so	that	i	could	test	it	and	we	could	figure	out	,	you	know	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	which	 color 	 s 	 	of	red	light	we	had	to	use	so	that	we	could	see	the	 animal 	 s 	 	,	but	they	could	n't	see	us	--	get	the	 electron 	 ic 	 	 jelly 	 fish 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	.
and	you	can	see	just	what	a	 shoe 	 string 	 	operation	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	was	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	cast	these	16	blue	leds	in	 ep 	 oxy 	 	and	you	can	see	in	the	 ep 	 oxy 	 	mold	that	we	used	,	the	word	ziploc	is	still	visible	.
 needle 	 s 	 s 	 	to	say	,	when	it	's	 klug 	 ed 	 	together	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	a	lot	of	 trial 	 s 	 	and	 trib 	 ul 	 ations 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	.
but	there	came	a	moment	when	it	all	came	together	,	and	 every 	 thing 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	.	and	,	 remark 	 ably 	 	,	that	moment	got	caught	on	film	by	 photograph 	 er 	 	mark	richards	,	who	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	be	there	at	the	precise	moment	that	we	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	it	all	came	together	.
that	's	me	on	the	left	,	my	graduate	student	at	the	time	,	erika	raymond	,	and	lee	fry	,	who	was	the	engineer	on	the	project	.
and	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	photograph	 post 	 ed 	 	in	our	lab	in	a	place	of	honor	with	the	 cap 	 tion 	 	:	``	engineer	 satisfy 	 ing 	 	two	women	at	once	.	``
and	we	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	.
so	now	we	had	a	system	that	we	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	take	to	some	place	that	was	kind	of	like	an	 oa 	 sis 	 	on	the	bottom	of	the	ocean	that	might	be	 patrol 	 led 	 	by	large	 predator 	 s 	 	.
and	so	,	the	place	that	we	took	it	to	was	 th 	 is 	 	place	 call 	 ed 	 	a	 br 	 ine 	 	pool	,	which	is	in	the	 north 	 ern 	 	part	of	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	of	mexico	.
it	's	a	 magic 	 al 	 	place	.
and	i	know	 th 	 is 	 	 foot 	 age 	 	is	n't	going	to	look	like	 any 	 thing 	 	to	you	--	we	had	a	crummy	camera	at	the	time	--	but	i	was	 ec 	 static 	 	.
we	're	at	the	edge	of	the	 br 	 ine 	 	pool	,
there	's	a	fish	that	's	 swimm 	 ing 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	camera	.
it	's	 clear 	 ly 	 	 un 	 disturb 	 ed 	 	by	us	.
and	i	had	my	window	 in 	 to 	 	the	deep	sea	.
i	,	for	the	first	time	,	could	see	what	 animal 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	down	there	when	we	 we 	 re 	 	n't	down	there	 disturb 	 ing 	 	them	in	some	way	.
four	 hour 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 deploy 	 ment 	 	,	we	had	 programm 	 ed 	 	the	 electron 	 ic 	 	 jelly 	 fish 	 	to	come	on	for	the	first	time	.
 eight 	 y 	 	-	six	 second 	 s 	 	after	it	went	 in 	 to 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 pin 	 wheel 	 	 dis 	 play 	 	,	we	 record 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	:
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 s 	 quid 	 	,	over	six	feet	long	,	that	is	so	new	to	science	,	it	can	not	be	 place 	 d 	 	in	any	known	scientific	family	.
i	could	not	have	 ask 	 ed 	 	for	a	better	proof	of	 con 	 cept 	 	.
and	based	on	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	went	back	to	the	national	science	 found 	 ation 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	will	discover	.	``
and	they	 g 	 ave 	 	me	 en 	 ough 	 	money	to	do	it	right	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	 develop 	 ing 	 	the	world	's	first	deep	-	sea	 web 	 cam 	 	--	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 install 	 ed 	 	in	the	monterey	canyon	for	the	past	year	--
and	now	,	more	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	a	modular	form	of	 th 	 is 	 	system	,	a	much	more	mobile	form	that	's	a	lot	 eas 	 ier 	 	to	launch	and	 re 	 cover 	 	,	that	i	hope	can	be	used	on	sylvia	's	``	hope	 spot 	 s 	 	``	to	help	explore	and	protect	these	 area 	 s 	 	,	and	,	for	me	,	learn	more	about	the	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nce 	 	in	these	``	hope	 spot 	 s 	 	.	``
so	one	of	these	take	-	home	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	here	is	,	there	is	still	a	lot	to	explore	in	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	.	and	sylvia	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	that	we	are	 destroy 	 ing 	 	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	before	we	even	know	what	's	in	them	,	and	she	's	right	.
so	if	you	ever	,	ever	get	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	take	a	 d 	 ive 	 	in	a	submersible	,	say	 y 	 es 	 	--	a	thousand	 time 	 s 	 	,	 y 	 es 	 	--	and	 pleas 	 e 	 	turn	out	the	 light 	 s 	 	.
i	promise	,	you	'll	love	it	.
thank	you	.
