so	i	just	want	to	tell	you	my	story	.
i	 s 	 pend 	 	a	lot	of	time	 teach 	 ing 	 	 adult 	 s 	 	how	to	use	visual	language	and	 doodl 	 ing 	 	in	the	 work 	 place 	 	.
and	 natural 	 ly 	 	,	i	 en 	 counter 	 	a	lot	of	 resist 	 ance 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 consider 	 ed 	 	to	be	anti	-	intellectual	and	counter	to	serious	 learn 	 ing 	 	.
but	i	have	a	problem	with	that	belief	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	know	that	 doodl 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 pro 	 found 	 	impact	on	the	way	that	we	can	process	information	and	the	way	that	we	can	solve	 problem 	 s 	 	.
so	i	was	 cur 	 ious 	 	about	why	there	was	a	 dis 	 connect 	 	between	the	way	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	 perceive 	 s 	 	 doodl 	 ing 	 	and	the	way	that	the	 re 	 ality 	 	is	.
so	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	some	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	there	's	no	 s 	 uch 	 	thing	 a 	 s 	 	a	 flatter 	 ing 	 	definition	of	a	doodle	.
in	the	17th	century	,	a	doodle	was	a	 simple 	 ton 	 	or	a	fool	--	 a 	 s 	 	in	yankee	doodle	.
in	the	18th	century	,	it	 be 	 came 	 	a	verb	,	and	it	 me 	 ant 	 	to	swindle	or	 ridicul 	 e 	 	or	to	make	 f 	 un 	 	of	 some 	 one 	 	.
in	the	19th	century	,	it	was	a	corrupt	 politic 	 ian 	 	.
and	 to 	 day 	 	,	we	have	what	is	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	our	most	offensive	definition	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	to	me	,	which	is	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	:	to	doodle	 official 	 ly 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	to	dawdle	,	to	 dil 	 ly 	 	 d 	 ally 	 	,	to	monkey	around	,	to	make	 meaning 	 less 	 	 mark 	 s 	 	,	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	of	little	value	,	 sub 	 stance 	 	or	import	,	and	--	my	personal	 favor 	 ite 	 	--	to	do	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
no	wonder	people	are	 a 	 verse 	 	to	 doodl 	 ing 	 	at	work	.
 do 	 ing 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	at	work	is	 a 	 kin 	 	to	 masturb 	 ating 	 	at	work	;	it	's	 total 	 ly 	 	 in 	 appropriate 	 	.
 add 	 ition 	 ally 	 	,	i	've	heard	 horr 	 or 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	from	people	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 teacher 	 s 	 	 s 	 cold 	 ed 	 	them	,	of	course	,	for	 doodl 	 ing 	 	in	 class 	 rooms 	 	.
and	they	have	 bo 	 s 	 s 	 es 	 	who	 s 	 cold 	 	them	for	 doodl 	 ing 	 	in	the	 board 	 room 	 	.
there	is	a	 power 	 ful 	 	cultural	norm	against	 doodl 	 ing 	 	in	 setting 	 s 	 	in	which	we	are	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	learn	 some 	 thing 	 	.
and	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	the	press	 tend 	 s 	 	to	reinforce	 th 	 is 	 	norm	when	they	're	 report 	 ing 	 	on	a	 doodl 	 ing 	 	scene	--	of	an	 import 	 ant 	 	person	at	a	 confirm 	 ation 	 	 hear 	 ing 	 	and	the	like	--	they	 typical 	 ly 	 	use	 word 	 s 	 	like	``	 discover 	 ed 	 	``	or	``	caught	``	or	``	found	out	,	``	 a 	 s 	 	if	there	's	some	sort	of	criminal	act	 be 	 ing 	 	 commit 	 ted 	 	.
and	 add 	 ition 	 ally 	 	,	there	is	a	 psycho 	 logical 	 	 a 	 version 	 	to	 doodl 	 ing 	 	--	thank	you	,	freud	.
in	the	1930s	,	freud	told	us	all	that	you	could	 analyz 	 e 	 	people	's	 psych 	 es 	 	based	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 doodle 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	accurate	,	but	it	did	happen	to	tony	blair	at	the	davos	forum	in	2005	,	when	his	 doodle 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	,	of	course	,	``	 discover 	 ed 	 	``	and	he	was	 label 	 ed 	 	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
now	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	bill	 gate 	 s 	 	'	doodle	.
and	bill	,	if	you	're	here	,	 no 	 body 	 	 think 	 s 	 	you	're	 mega 	 lomaniacal 	 	.
but	that	 do 	 es 	 	 con 	 tribute 	 	to	people	not	 want 	 ing 	 	to	share	 the 	 ir 	 	 doodle 	 s 	 	.
and	here	is	the	real	deal	.	here	's	what	i	 believ 	 e 	 	.	i	think	that	our	culture	is	so	 intens 	 e 	 ly 	 	focused	on	verbal	information	that	we	're	 al 	 most 	 	 blind 	 ed 	 	to	the	value	of	 doodl 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	'm	not	 comfort 	 able 	 	with	that	.
and	so	 be 	 cause 	 	of	that	belief	that	i	think	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	burst	,	i	'm	here	to	 s 	 end 	 	us	all	 hurt 	 ling 	 	back	to	the	truth	.
and	here	's	the	truth	:	 doodl 	 ing 	 	is	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	tool	,	and	it	is	a	tool	that	we	need	to	remember	and	to	re	-	learn	.
so	here	's	a	new	definition	for	 doodl 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	hope	there	's	 some 	 one 	 	in	here	from	the	oxford	english	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	,
 be 	 cause 	 	i	want	to	talk	to	you	 lat 	 er 	 	.
here	's	the	real	definition	:	 doodl 	 ing 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	to	make	 spontane 	 ous 	 	 mark 	 s 	 	to	help	 your 	 self 	 	think	.
that	is	why	 million 	 s 	 	of	people	doodle	.
here	's	 an 	 other 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	truth	about	the	doodle	:	people	who	doodle	when	they	're	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	to	verbal	information	retain	more	of	that	information	than	 the 	 ir 	 	non	-	 doodl 	 ing 	 	 counter 	 part 	 s 	 	.
we	think	 doodl 	 ing 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	you	do	when	you	lose	focus	,	but	in	 re 	 ality 	 	,	it	is	a	 pre 	 emptive 	 	measure	to	stop	you	from	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	focus	.
 add 	 ition 	 ally 	 	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 pro 	 found 	 	effect	on	creative	problem	-	solving	and	deep	information	 process 	 ing 	 	.
there	are	four	ways	that	 learn 	 ers 	 	 in 	 take 	 	information	so	that	they	can	make	 decision 	 s 	 	.
they	are	visual	,	 audit 	 ory 	 	,	 read 	 ing 	 	and	writing	and	kinesthetic	.
now	in	order	for	us	to	 re 	 ally 	 	chew	on	information	and	do	 some 	 thing 	 	with	it	,	we	have	to	engage	at	 l 	 east 	 	two	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 mod 	 al 	 ities 	 	,	or	we	have	to	engage	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 mod 	 al 	 ities 	 	 couple 	 d 	 	with	an	 emotion 	 al 	 	experience	.
the	 in 	 credible 	 	 con 	 trib 	 ution 	 	of	the	doodle	is	that	it	 engage 	 s 	 	all	four	 learn 	 ing 	 	 mod 	 al 	 ities 	 	 simultaneous 	 ly 	 	with	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	an	 emotion 	 al 	 	experience	.
that	is	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	solid	 con 	 trib 	 ution 	 	for	a	behavior	 equate 	 d 	 	with	 do 	 ing 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	so	 nerd 	 y 	 	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	made	me	cry	when	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	they	did	 anthropo 	 logical 	 	research	 in 	 to 	 	the	 un 	 fold 	 ing 	 	of	 art 	 istic 	 	activity	in	children	,	and	they	found	that	,	 a 	 cross 	 	space	and	time	,	all	children	exhibit	the	same	evolution	in	visual	logic	 a 	 s 	 	they	grow	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	they	have	a	 share 	 d 	 	and	growing	 complex 	 ity 	 	in	visual	language	that	 happen 	 s 	 	in	a	 predict 	 able 	 	order	.
and	i	think	that	is	 in 	 credible 	 	.
i	think	that	 mean 	 s 	 	 doodl 	 ing 	 	is	native	to	us	and	we	 simpl 	 y 	 	are	 den 	 y 	 ing 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	that	instinct	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	a	lot	a	people	are	n't	 pri 	 vy 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	the	doodle	is	a	 pre 	 cursor 	 	to	some	of	our	 great 	 est 	 	cultural	 asset 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	but	one	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	frank	gehry	the	architect	's	 pre 	 cursor 	 	to	the	guggenheim	in	abu	dhabi	.
so	here	is	my	point	:	under	no	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	should	 doodl 	 ing 	 	be	 eradic 	 ated 	 	from	a	 class 	 room 	 	or	a	 board 	 room 	 	or	even	the	war	room	.
on	the	 contr 	 ary 	 	,	 doodl 	 ing 	 	should	be	 leverage 	 d 	 	in	 precise 	 ly 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 situ 	 ations 	 	where	information	density	is	 ver 	 y 	 	high	and	the	need	for	 process 	 ing 	 	that	information	is	 ver 	 y 	 	high	.
and	i	will	go	you	one	further	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 doodl 	 ing 	 	is	so	 universal 	 ly 	 	 access 	 ible 	 	and	it	is	not	 intimid 	 ating 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	art	form	,	it	can	be	 leverage 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 port 	 al 	 	through	which	we	move	people	 in 	 to 	 	 high 	 er 	 	 level 	 s 	 	of	visual	 liter 	 acy 	 	.
my	 friend 	 s 	 	,	the	doodle	 ha 	 s 	 	never	 be 	 en 	 	the	nemesis	of	intellectual	thought	.
in	 re 	 ality 	 	,	it	is	one	of	 it 	 s 	 	 great 	 est 	 	 al 	 lies 	 	.
thank	you	.
