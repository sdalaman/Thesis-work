well	,	good	 morn 	 ing 	 	 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	.
my	name	is	art	benjamin	,	and	i	am	a	``	 mathe 	 magic 	 ian 	 	.	``
what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	is	,	i	combine	my	 love 	 s 	 	of	math	and	magic	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	i	call	``	 mathe 	 magic 	 s 	 	.	``
but	before	i	get	 start 	 ed 	 	,	i	have	a	quick	question	for	the	audience	.
by	any	chance	,	did	 any 	 one 	 	happen	to	 br 	 ing 	 	with	them	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	a	 calcul 	 ator 	 	?
 serious 	 ly 	 	,	if	you	have	a	 calcul 	 ator 	 	with	you	,	raise	your	hand	,	raise	your	hand	.
i	--	was	--	your	hand	go	up	?
now	 br 	 ing 	 	it	out	,	 br 	 ing 	 	it	out	.	 any 	 body 	 	else	?
i	see	,	i	see	one	way	in	the	back	.
you	 s 	 ir 	 	,	that	's	three	,
and	 any 	 body 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	side	here	?
ok	,	you	over	there	on	the	aisle	.	would	the	four	of	you	with	 calcul 	 ators 	 	 pleas 	 e 	 	 br 	 ing 	 	out	your	 calcul 	 ators 	 	,	then	join	me	up	on	stage	.
and	let	's	give	these	 volunteer 	 s 	 	a	nice	round	of	 app 	 laus 	 e 	 	.
that	's	right	.	now	,	since	i	have	n't	had	the	chance	to	work	with	these	 calcul 	 ators 	 	,	i	need	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	they	are	all	 work 	 ing 	 	 proper 	 ly 	 	.
would	 some 	 body 	 	get	us	 start 	 ed 	 	by	giving	us	a	two	-	digit	number	 pleas 	 e 	 	?
how	about	a	two	-	digit	number	?
audience	:	22	.
arthur	benjamin	:	22.	and	 an 	 other 	 	two	-	digit	number	,	 s 	 ir 	 	?
audience	:	47	.
ab	:	 multi 	 ply 	 	22	 time 	 s 	 	47	,	make	 s 	 ure 	 	you	get	1,034	,	or	the	 calcul 	 ators 	 	are	not	 work 	 ing 	 	.	do	all	of	you	get	1,034	?	1,034	?
woman	:	no	.
ab	:	594.	let	's	give	three	of	them	a	nice	round	of	 app 	 laus 	 e 	 	there	.
would	you	like	to	try	a	more	standard	 calcul 	 ator 	 	,	just	in	case	?
ok	,	great	.
what	i	'm	going	to	try	and	do	then	--	i	notice	that	took	some	of	you	a	little	bit	of	time	to	get	your	answer	.
that	's	ok	.	i	'll	give	you	a	 short 	 cut 	 	for	 multi 	 ply 	 ing 	 	even	 fast 	 er 	 	on	the	 calcul 	 ator 	 	.
there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	square	of	a	number	,	which	most	of	you	know	is	taking	a	number	and	 multi 	 ply 	 ing 	 	it	by	 it 	 self 	 	.
for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	five	 square 	 d 	 	would	be	?
audience	:	25	.
ab	:	25.	now	,	the	way	we	can	square	on	most	 calcul 	 ators 	 	--	let	me	 demonst 	 rate 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	one	--	is	by	taking	the	number	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	five	,	hitting	``	 time 	 s 	 	``	and	then	``	 equal 	 s 	 	,	``	and	on	most	 calcul 	 ators 	 	that	will	give	you	the	square	.
on	some	of	these	ancient	rpn	 calcul 	 ators 	 	,	you	've	got	an	``	x	 square 	 d 	 	``	button	on	it	,	will	allow	you	to	do	the	 calcul 	 ation 	 	even	 fast 	 er 	 	.
what	i	'm	going	to	try	and	do	now	is	to	square	,	in	my	head	,	four	two	-	digit	 number 	 s 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	than	they	can	do	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 calcul 	 ators 	 	,	even	using	the	 short 	 cut 	 	method	.
what	i	'll	use	is	the	second	row	 th 	 is 	 	time	,	and	i	'll	get	four	of	you	--	one	,	two	,	three	,	four	--	to	each	yell	out	a	two	-	digit	number	,	and	if	you	would	square	the	first	number	,	and	if	you	would	square	the	second	,	the	third	and	the	fourth	,	i	will	try	and	race	you	to	the	answer	.	ok	?
so	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	a	two	-	digit	number	 pleas 	 e 	 	.
audience	:	37	.

let	me	try	to	take	 th 	 is 	 	one	step	further	.
i	'm	going	to	try	to	square	some	three	-	digit	 number 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	time	.
i	wo	n't	even	write	these	down	--	i	'll	just	call	them	out	 a 	 s 	 	they	're	 call 	 ed 	 	out	to	me	.
 any 	 one 	 	i	point	to	,	call	out	a	three	-	digit	number	.
 any 	 one 	 	on	our	 pan 	 el 	 	,	 ver 	 ify 	 	the	answer	.

audience	:	162	.
162	 square 	 d 	 	is	26,244	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
let	me	try	to	take	 th 	 is 	 	one	step	further	.
i	'm	going	to	try	to	square	a	four	-	digit	number	 th 	 is 	 	time	.
now	you	can	all	take	your	time	on	 th 	 is 	 	;	i	will	not	beat	you	to	the	answer	on	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	but	i	will	try	to	get	the	answer	right	.
to	make	 th 	 is 	 	a	little	bit	more	random	,	let	's	take	the	fourth	row	 th 	 is 	 	time	,	let	's	say	,	one	,	two	,	three	,	four	.
if	each	of	you	would	call	out	a	single	digit	between	zero	and	nine	,	that	will	be	the	four	-	digit	number	that	i	'll	square	.
audience	:	nine	.
ab	:	nine	.
audience	:	seven	.	ab	:	seven	.
audience	:	five	.	ab	:	five	.
audience	:	eight	.	ab	:	eight	.
9,758	,	 th 	 is 	 	will	take	me	a	little	bit	of	time	,	so	bear	with	me	.
95,218,564	?
woman	:	 y 	 es 	 	.
ab	:	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
now	,	i	would	attempt	to	square	a	five	-	digit	number	--	and	i	can	--	but	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	most	 calcul 	 ators 	 	can	not	.
eight	-	digit	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	--	do	n't	you	hate	that	?
so	,	since	we	've	 reach 	 ed 	 	the	 limit 	 s 	 	of	our	 calcul 	 ators 	 	--	what	's	that	?	 do 	 es 	 	 your 	 s 	 	go	--	woman	:	i	do	n't	know	.
ab	:	 do 	 es 	 	 your 	 s 	 	go	 high 	 er 	 	?
oh	--	 your 	 s 	 	 do 	 es 	 	?
man	:	i	can	 prob 	 ably 	 	do	it	.
ab	:	i	'll	talk	to	you	 lat 	 er 	 	.
in	the	 mean 	 while 	 	,	let	me	conclude	the	first	part	of	my	show	by	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	a	little	 trick 	 ier 	 	.
let	's	take	the	largest	number	on	the	board	here	,	8649	.
would	you	each	enter	that	on	your	 calcul 	 ator 	 	?
and	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 s 	 quar 	 ing 	 	it	 th 	 is 	 	time	,	i	want	you	to	take	that	number	and	 multi 	 ply 	 	it	by	any	three	-	digit	number	that	you	want	,	but	do	n't	tell	me	what	you	're	 multi 	 ply 	 ing 	 	by	--	just	 multi 	 ply 	 	it	by	any	random	three	-	digit	number	.
so	you	should	have	 a 	 s 	 	an	answer	either	a	six	-	digit	or	 prob 	 ably 	 	a	seven	-	digit	number	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	 digit 	 s 	 	do	you	have	,	six	or	seven	?
seven	,	and	 your 	 s 	 	?	woman	:	seven	.
ab	:	seven	?	seven	?
and	,	 un 	 certain 	 	.
man	:	 yea 	 h 	 	.
ab	:	seven	.	is	there	any	possible	way	that	i	could	know	what	seven	digit	 number 	 s 	 	you	have	?	say	``	no.	``
good	.	then	i	 s 	 hall 	 	attempt	the	 im 	 possible 	 	--	or	at	 l 	 east 	 	the	 im 	 prob 	 able 	 	.
what	i	'd	like	each	of	you	to	do	is	to	call	out	for	me	any	six	of	your	seven	 digit 	 s 	 	,	any	six	of	them	,	in	any	order	you	'd	like	.
one	digit	at	a	time	,	i	 s 	 hall 	 	try	and	determine	the	digit	you	've	left	out	.
so	,	 start 	 ing 	 	with	your	seven	-	digit	number	,	call	out	any	six	of	them	 pleas 	 e 	 	.
woman	:	one	,	ok	,	197042	.
ab	:	did	you	 leav 	 e 	 	out	the	number	6	?
woman	:	 y 	 es 	 	,	ab	:	good	,	ok	,	that	's	one	.
you	have	a	seven	-	digit	number	,	call	out	any	six	of	them	 pleas 	 e 	 	.

that	's	three	.	the	 odd 	 s 	 	of	me	 get 	 ting 	 	all	four	of	these	right	by	random	 guess 	 ing 	 	would	be	one	in	10,000	:	10	to	the	fourth	power	.

and	let	's	give	all	four	of	these	people	a	nice	round	of	 app 	 laus 	 e 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
for	my	next	number	--	while	i	 ment 	 ally 	 	 re 	 charge 	 	my	 batt 	 eries 	 	,	i	have	one	more	question	for	the	audience	.

but	i	'd	like	to	wrap	 thing 	 s 	 	up	now	by	 allud 	 ing 	 	to	 some 	 thing 	 	from	 ear 	 lier 	 	in	the	 present 	 ation 	 	.
there	was	a	 gentle 	 man 	 	up	here	who	had	a	10	-	digit	 calcul 	 ator 	 	.
where	is	he	,	would	you	stand	up	,	10	-	digit	guy	?
ok	,	well	stand	up	for	me	just	for	a	second	,	so	i	can	see	where	you	are	.
ok	,	oh	,	ok	--	you	have	a	10	-	digit	 calcul 	 ator 	 	,	 s 	 ir 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	?
ok	,	what	i	'm	going	to	try	and	do	,	is	to	square	in	my	head	a	five	-	digit	number	 requir 	 ing 	 	a	10	-	digit	 calcul 	 ator 	 	.
but	to	make	my	job	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	for	you	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	for	me	,	i	'm	going	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	problem	 think 	 ing 	 	out	loud	.
so	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 honest 	 ly 	 	hear	what	's	going	on	in	my	mind	while	i	do	a	 calcul 	 ation 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 ize 	 	.
now	,	i	have	to	 apolog 	 ize 	 	to	our	 magic 	 ian 	 	friend	lennart	green	.
i	know	 a 	 s 	 	a	 magic 	 ian 	 	we	're	not	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	reveal	our	 secret 	 s 	 	,	but	i	'm	not	too	 af 	 raid 	 	that	people	are	going	to	start	 do 	 ing 	 	my	show	next	week	,	so	--	i	think	we	're	ok	.
so	,	let	's	see	,	let	's	take	a	--	let	's	take	a	different	row	of	people	,	 start 	 ing 	 	with	you	.
i	'll	get	five	 digit 	 s 	 	:	one	,	two	,	three	,	four	--	oh	,	i	did	 th 	 is 	 	row	 al 	 ready 	 	.	let	's	do	the	row	before	you	,	 start 	 ing 	 	with	you	 s 	 ir 	 	:	one	,	two	,	three	,	four	,	five	.

57,683	 square 	 d 	 	.	 yu 	 ck 	 	.
let	me	explain	to	you	how	i	'm	going	to	attempt	 th 	 is 	 	problem	.
i	'm	going	to	break	the	problem	down	 in 	 to 	 	three	 part 	 s 	 	.
i	'll	do	57,000	 square 	 d 	 	,	plus	683	 square 	 d 	 	,	plus	57,000	 time 	 s 	 	683	 time 	 s 	 	two	.
add	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 number 	 s 	 	together	,	and	with	any	luck	,	 arriv 	 e 	 	at	the	answer	.
now	,	let	me	 re 	 cap 	 	.
thank	you	.
while	i	explain	 some 	 thing 	 	else	--	--	i	know	,	that	you	can	use	,	right	?
while	i	do	these	 calcul 	 ation 	 	[	s	]	,	you	might	hear	certain	 word 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	 number 	 s 	 	,	creep	 in 	 to 	 	the	 calcul 	 ation 	 	.
let	me	explain	what	that	is	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 phone 	 tic 	 	code	,	a	mnemonic	 de 	 vice 	 	that	i	use	,	that	 allow 	 s 	 	me	to	convert	 number 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 word 	 s 	 	.
i	store	them	 a 	 s 	 	 word 	 s 	 	,	and	 lat 	 er 	 	on	retrieve	them	 a 	 s 	 	 number 	 s 	 	.
i	know	it	 sound 	 s 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	;	it	's	not	--	i	just	do	n't	want	you	to	think	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	out	of	``	rain	man	``	here	.
there	's	 definite 	 ly 	 	a	method	to	my	 mad 	 ness 	 	--	 definite 	 ly 	 	,	 definite 	 ly 	 	.	sorry	.
if	you	want	to	talk	to	me	about	adhd	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	you	can	talk	to	me	then	.	all	right	--	by	the	way	,	one	last	 instruct 	 ion 	 	,	for	my	 judg 	 es 	 	with	the	 calcul 	 ators 	 	--	ok	,	you	know	who	you	are	--	there	is	at	 l 	 east 	 	a	50	percent	chance	that	i	will	make	a	 mistak 	 e 	 	here	.
if	i	do	,	do	n't	tell	me	what	the	 mistak 	 e 	 	is	;
just	say	,	``	you	're	close	,	``	or	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	,	and	i	'll	try	and	figure	out	the	answer	--	which	could	be	 pre 	 tty 	 	 entertain 	 ing 	 	in	 it 	 self 	 	.
if	,	 how 	 ever 	 	,	i	am	right	,	 what 	 ever 	 	you	do	,	do	n't	keep	it	to	 your 	 self 	 	,	ok	?
make	 s 	 ure 	 	 every 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	that	i	got	the	answer	right	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	big	finish	,	ok	.
so	,	 with 	 out 	 	any	more	 stall 	 ing 	 	,	here	we	go	.
i	'll	start	the	problem	in	the	middle	,	with	57	 time 	 s 	 	683	.
now	,	57	 time 	 s 	 	68	is	3,400	,	plus	476	is	3876	,	that	's	38,760	plus	171	,	38,760	plus	171	is	38,931	.
38,931	;	double	that	to	get	77,862	.
77,862	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	cookie	 fi 	 s 	 s 	 ion 	 	,	cookie	 fi 	 s 	 s 	 ion 	 	is	77,822	.
that	 seem 	 s 	 	right	,	i	'll	go	on	.	cookie	 fi 	 s 	 s 	 ion 	 	,	ok	.
next	,	i	do	57	 square 	 d 	 	,	which	is	3,249	,	so	i	can	say	,	three	billion	.	take	the	249	,	add	that	to	cookie	,	249	,	 oop 	 s 	 	,	but	i	see	a	carry	coming	--	249	--	add	that	to	cookie	,	250	plus	77	,	is	327	million	--	 fi 	 s 	 s 	 ion 	 	,	 fi 	 s 	 s 	 ion 	 	,	ok	,	 final 	 ly 	 	,	we	do	683	 square 	 d 	 	,	that	's	700	 time 	 s 	 	666	,	plus	17	 square 	 d 	 	is	466,489	,	rev	up	if	i	need	it	,	rev	up	,	take	the	466	,	add	that	to	 fi 	 s 	 s 	 ion 	 	,	to	get	,	oh	gee	--	328,489	.
audience	:	 yea 	 h 	 	!
ab	:	good	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
i	hope	you	 enjoy 	 ed 	 	 mathe 	 magic 	 s 	 	.	thank	you	.
