we	've	 be 	 en 	 	told	to	go	out	on	a	limb	and	say	 some 	 thing 	 	surprising	.
so	i	'll	try	and	do	that	,	but	i	want	to	start	with	two	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 every 	 one 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	 know 	 s 	 	.
and	the	first	one	,	in	fact	,	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	known	for	most	of	 record 	 ed 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
and	that	is	that	the	planet	earth	,	or	the	solar	system	,	or	our	environment	or	 what 	 ever 	 	,	is	 un 	 ique 	 ly 	 	 suit 	 ed 	 	to	sustain	our	evolution	--	or	creation	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	used	to	be	thought	--	and	our	present	 exist 	 ence 	 	,	and	most	 import 	 ant 	 	,	our	future	 surviv 	 al 	 	.
 now 	 a 	 day 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	idea	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 dramat 	 ic 	 	name	:	 space 	 ship 	 	earth	.
and	the	idea	there	is	that	 out 	 side 	 	the	 space 	 ship 	 	,	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	 imp 	 lac 	 ably 	 	 hostil 	 e 	 	,	and	 in 	 side 	 	is	all	we	have	,	all	we	depend	on	.
and	we	 on 	 ly 	 	get	the	one	chance	:	if	we	mess	up	our	 space 	 ship 	 	,	we	've	got	 no 	 where 	 	else	to	go	.
now	,	the	second	thing	that	 every 	 one 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	 know 	 s 	 	is	that	 contr 	 ary 	 	to	what	was	 believ 	 ed 	 	for	most	of	human	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	are	not	,	in	fact	,	the	hub	of	 exist 	 ence 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	stephen	 hawk 	 ing 	 	 famous 	 ly 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	we	're	just	a	chemical	 s 	 cum 	 	on	the	surface	of	a	typical	planet	that	's	in	orbit	around	a	typical	star	,	which	is	on	the	 out 	 skirt 	 s 	 	of	a	typical	 galax 	 y 	 	,	and	so	on	.
now	the	first	of	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 every 	 one 	 	 know 	 s 	 	is	kind	of	 say 	 ing 	 	that	we	're	at	a	 ver 	 y 	 	un	-	typical	place	,	 un 	 ique 	 ly 	 	 suit 	 ed 	 	and	so	on	,	and
the	second	one	is	 say 	 ing 	 	that	we	're	at	a	typical	place	.
and	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	if	you	regard	these	two	 a 	 s 	 	deep	 truth 	 s 	 	to	live	by	and	to	inform	your	life	 decision 	 s 	 	,	then	they	seem	a	little	bit	to	conflict	with	each	other	.
but	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	prevent	them	from	both	 be 	 ing 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	false	.
and	they	are	.	so	let	me	start	with	the	second	one	:	typical	.	well	--	is	 th 	 is 	 	a	typical	place	?	well	,	let	's	look	around	,	you	know	,	and	look	in	a	random	direction	,	and	we	see	a	wall	,	and	chemical	 s 	 cum 	 	--	--	and	that	's	not	typical	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	at	all	.
all	you	've	got	to	do	is	go	a	few	hundred	 mile 	 s 	 	in	that	same	direction	and	look	back	,	and	you	wo	n't	see	any	 wall 	 s 	 	or	chemical	 s 	 cum 	 	at	all	--	all	you	see	is	a	blue	planet	.	and	if	you	go	further	than	that	,	you	'll	see	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	the	solar	system	,	and	the	 star 	 s 	 	and	so	on	.
but	that	's	still	not	typical	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 star 	 s 	 	come	in	 galax 	 ies 	 	.
and	most	 place 	 s 	 	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	a	typical	place	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	is	 no 	 where 	 	near	any	 galax 	 ies 	 	.
so	let	's	go	out	further	,	till	we	're	 out 	 side 	 	the	 galax 	 y 	 	,	and	look	back	,	and	 yea 	 h 	 	,	there	's	the	huge	 galax 	 y 	 	with	spiral	 arm 	 s 	 	laid	out	in	front	of	us	.
and	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	we	've	come	100,000	light	 year 	 s 	 	from	here	.
but	we	're	still	 no 	 where 	 	near	a	typical	place	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
to	get	to	a	typical	place	,	you	've	got	to	go	1,000	 time 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	that	 in 	 to 	 	 inter 	 galactic 	 	space	.
and	so	what	 do 	 es 	 	that	look	like	?	typical	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	a	typical	place	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	look	like	?
well	,	at	enormous	expense	,	ted	 ha 	 s 	 	 arrange 	 d 	 	a	high	-	 re 	 solution 	 	 immers 	 ion 	 	virtual	 re 	 ality 	 	 render 	 ing 	 	of	 inter 	 galactic 	 	space	--	the	view	from	 inter 	 galactic 	 	space	.
so	can	we	have	the	 light 	 s 	 	off	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	,	so	we	can	see	it	?
well	,	not	 quit 	 e 	 	,	not	 quit 	 e 	 	perfect	--	you	see	,	in	 inter 	 galactic 	 	space	--	 inter 	 galactic 	 	space	is	 complete 	 ly 	 	dark	,	pitch	dark	.
it	's	so	dark	that	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	to	be	looking	at	the	 near 	 est 	 	star	to	you	,	and	that	star	 we 	 re 	 	to	explode	 a 	 s 	 	a	supernova	,	and	you	 we 	 re 	 	to	be	 star 	 ing 	 	 direct 	 ly 	 	at	it	at	the	moment	when	 it 	 s 	 	light	 reach 	 ed 	 	you	,	you	still	would	n't	be	able	to	see	even	a	glimmer	.
that	's	how	big	and	how	dark	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	.
and	that	's	 de 	 spite 	 	the	fact	that	a	supernova	is	so	bright	,	so	 brilli 	 ant 	 	an	event	,	that	it	would	kill	you	stone	dead	at	a	range	of	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	light	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	yet	from	 inter 	 galactic 	 	space	,	it	's	so	far	away	you	would	n't	even	see	it	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	cold	out	there	--	less	than	three	 degree 	 s 	 	above	absolute	zero	.
and	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	empty	.	the	vacuum	there	is	one	million	 time 	 s 	 	less	dense	than	the	highest	vacuum	that	our	best	technology	on	earth	can	 current 	 ly 	 
create	.	so	that	's	how	different	a	typical	place	is	from	 th 	 is 	 	place	.
and	that	is	how	un	-	typical	 th 	 is 	 	place	is	.
so	can	we	have	the	 light 	 s 	 	back	on	 pleas 	 e 	 	?	thank	you	.
now	how	do	we	know	about	an	environment	that	's	so	far	away	,	and	so	different	,	and	so	alien	,	from	 any 	 thing 	 	we	're	used	to	?
well	,	the	earth	--	our	environment	,	in	the	form	of	us	--	is	creating	knowledge	.
well	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	?	well	,	look	out	even	further	than	we	've	just	 be 	 en 	 	--	i	mean	from	here	,	with	a	 tele 	 scope 	 	--	and	you	'll	see	 thing 	 s 	 	that	look	like	 star 	 s 	 	.
they	're	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 quasar 	 s 	 	.	``	 quasar 	 s 	 	 original 	 ly 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	quasi	-	stellar	object	.
which	 mean 	 s 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	look	a	bit	like	 star 	 s 	 	.	but	they	're	not	 star 	 s 	 	.
and	we	know	what	they	are	.	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	 billion 	 s 	 	of	light	 year 	 s 	 	away	,	the	material	at	the	center	of	a	 galax 	 y 	 	 collapse 	 d 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	a	super	-	massive	black	hole	.
and	then	 intens 	 e 	 	 magnet 	 ic 	 	 field 	 s 	 	 direct 	 ed 	 	some	of	the	energy	of	that	 gravit 	 ation 	 al 	 	collapse	.	and	some	of	the	matter	,	back	out	in	the	form	of	tremendous	 jet 	 s 	 	which	 illuminate 	 d 	 	 lobe 	 s 	 	with	the	 brilli 	 ance 	 	of	--	i	think	it	's	a	trillion	 s 	 un 	 s 	 	.
now	,	the	physics	of	the	human	brain	could	 hard 	 ly 	 	be	more	 un 	 like 	 	the	physics	of	 s 	 uch 	 	a	jet	.
we	could	n't	 surviv 	 e 	 	for	an	instant	in	it	.	language	 break 	 s 	 	down	when	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	what	it	would	be	like	in	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 jet 	 s 	 	.
it	would	be	a	bit	like	 ex 	 peri 	 encing 	 	a	supernova	explosion	,	but	at	point	-	blank	range	and	for	 million 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	at	a	time	.
and	yet	,	that	jet	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	 precise 	 ly 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	a	way	that	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	on	the	other	side	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	some	bit	of	chemical	 s 	 cum 	 	could	 accurate 	 ly 	 	 de 	 scribe 	 	,	and	model	,	and	predict	,	and	explain	,	above	all	--	there	's	your	 re 	 ference 	 	--	what	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	there	,	in	 re 	 ality 	 	.
the	one	physical	system	,	the	brain	,	 contain 	 s 	 	an	accurate	 work 	 ing 	 	model	of	the	other	--	the	quasar	.
not	just	a	 super 	 ficial 	 	image	of	it	,	 th 	 ough 	 	it	 contain 	 s 	 	that	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	but	an	 explan 	 atory 	 	model	,	 em 	 body 	 ing 	 	the	same	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 relationship 	 s 	 	and	the	same	 caus 	 al 	 	structure	.
now	that	is	knowledge	.	and	if	that	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	the	 faith 	 fulness 	 	with	which	the	one	structure	 resemble 	 s 	 	the	other	is	increasing	with	time	.	that	is	the	growth	of	knowledge	.
so	,	the	 law 	 s 	 	of	physics	have	 th 	 is 	 	special	 proper 	 ty 	 	.	that	physical	 object 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 un 	 like 	 	each	other	 a 	 s 	 	they	could	possibly	be	,	can	 never 	 the 	 less 	 	 em 	 body 	 	the	same	 mathematic 	 al 	 	and	 caus 	 al 	 	structure	and	to	do	it	more	and	more	so	over	time	.
so	we	are	a	chemical	 s 	 cum 	 	that	is	different	.	 th 	 is 	 	chemical	 s 	 cum 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 universal 	 ity 	 	.
 it 	 s 	 	structure	 contain 	 s 	 	,	with	ever	-	increasing	 pre 	 cis 	 ion 	 	,	the	structure	of	 every 	 thing 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	place	,	and	not	other	 place 	 s 	 	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	is	a	hub	which	 contain 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	 it 	 self 	 	the	structural	and	 caus 	 al 	 	 es 	 s 	 ence 	 	of	the	whole	of	the	rest	of	physical	 re 	 ality 	 	.	and	so	,	far	from	 be 	 ing 	 	 in 	 significant 	 	,	the	fact	that	the	 law 	 s 	 	of	physics	allow	 th 	 is 	 	,	or	even	 man 	 date 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	can	happen	,	is	one	of	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	about	the	physical	world	.
now	how	 do 	 es 	 	the	solar	system	--	and	our	environment	,	in	the	form	of	us	--	 acquir 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	special	relationship	with	the	rest	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	?
well	,	one	thing	that	's	true	about	stephen	 hawk 	 ing 	 	's	remark	--	i	mean	,	it	is	true	,	but	it	's	the	wrong	 emphas 	 is 	 	.	one	thing	that	's	true	about	it	is	that	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	do	it	with	any	special	physics	.	there	's	no	special	 dispens 	 ation 	 	,	no	 miracle 	 s 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	.	it	 do 	 es 	 	it	 simpl 	 y 	 	with	three	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	have	here	in	abundance	.
one	of	them	is	matter	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	growth	of	knowledge	is	a	form	of	information	 process 	 ing 	 	.	information	 process 	 ing 	 	is	computation	,	computation	 requir 	 es 	 	a	computer	--	there	's	no	known	way	of	making	a	computer	 with 	 out 	 	matter	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	need	energy	to	make	the	computer	,	and	most	 import 	 ant 	 	,	to	make	the	media	in	effect	onto	which	we	record	the	knowledge	that	we	discover	.
and	then	 third 	 ly 	 	,	less	tangible	,	but	just	 a 	 s 	 	essential	for	the	open	-	 end 	 ed 	 	creation	of	knowledge	,	of	 explan 	 ations 	 	,	is	evidence	.
now	,	our	environment	is	 in 	 un 	 d 	 ated 	 	with	evidence	.
we	happen	to	get	round	to	 test 	 ing 	 	,	let	's	say	,	newton	's	law	of	 gravit 	 y 	 	about	300	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
but	the	evidence	that	we	used	to	do	that	was	 fall 	 ing 	 	down	on	every	square	meter	of	the	earth	for	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	before	that	,	and	will	 continu 	 e 	 	to	fall	on	for	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	.	and	the	same	is	true	for	all	the	other	 science 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	we	know	,	evidence	to	discover	the	most	fundamental	 truth 	 s 	 	of	all	the	 science 	 s 	 	is	here	just	for	the	taking	on	our	planet	.
our	location	is	 saturate 	 d 	 	with	evidence	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	with	matter	and	energy	.
out	in	 inter 	 galactic 	 	space	,	 t 	 hose 	 	three	 pre 	 requisite 	 s 	 	for	the	open	-	 end 	 ed 	 	creation	of	knowledge	are	at	 the 	 ir 	 	 low 	 est 	 	possible	supply	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	it	's	empty	;	it	's	cold	;	and	it	's	dark	out	there	.	or	is	it	?
now	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	that	's	just	 an 	 other 	 	parochial	 mis 	 conception 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	imagine	a	cube	out	there	in	 inter 	 galactic 	 	space	,	the	same	 s 	 ize 	 	 a 	 s 	 	our	home	,	the	solar	system	.	now	that	cube	is	 ver 	 y 	 	empty	by	human	 standard 	 s 	 	,	but	that	still	 mean 	 s 	 	that	it	 contain 	 s 	 	over	a	million	 ton 	 s 	 	of	matter	.
and	a	million	 ton 	 s 	 	is	 en 	 ough 	 	to	make	,	say	,	a	self	-	 contain 	 ed 	 	space	station	,	on	which	there	's	a	 colon 	 y 	 	of	 scientist 	 s 	 	that	are	 devote 	 d 	 	to	creating	an	open	-	 end 	 ed 	 	stream	of	knowledge	,	and	so	on	.
now	,	it	's	way	beyond	present	technology	to	even	gather	the	hydrogen	from	 inter 	 galactic 	 	space	and	form	it	 in 	 to 	 	other	 element 	 s 	 	and	so	on	.
but	the	thing	is	,	in	a	 comprehens 	 ible 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	if	 some 	 thing 	 	is	n't	 forbid 	 den 	 	by	the	 law 	 s 	 	of	physics	,	then	what	could	possibly	prevent	us	from	 do 	 ing 	 	it	,	other	than	 know 	 ing 	 	how	?
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	it	's	a	matter	of	knowledge	,	not	 resource 	 s 	 	.
and	the	same	--	well	,	if	we	could	do	that	we	'd	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	have	an	energy	supply	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 trans 	 mutation 	 	would	be	a	fusion	reactor	--	and	evidence	?
well	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	it	's	dark	out	there	to	human	 sense 	 s 	 	.	but	all	you	've	got	to	do	is	take	a	 tele 	 scope 	 	,	even	one	of	present	-	day	design	,	look	out	and	you	'll	see	the	same	 galax 	 ies 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	do	from	here	.
and	with	a	more	 power 	 ful 	 	 tele 	 scope 	 	,	you	'll	be	able	to	see	 star 	 s 	 	,	and	 planet 	 s 	 	.	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 galax 	 ies 	 	,	you	'll	be	able	to	do	 astro 	 physics 	 	,	and	learn	the	 law 	 s 	 	of	physics	.
and	 local 	 ly 	 	there	you	could	build	particle	 accele 	 rator 	 s 	 	,	and	learn	 element 	 ary 	 	particle	physics	,	and	 chemist 	 ry 	 	,	and	so	on	.
 prob 	 ably 	 	the	 hard 	 est 	 	science	to	do	would	be	biology	field	 trip 	 s 	 	--	--	 be 	 cause 	 	it	would	take	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	hundred	million	 year 	 s 	 	to	get	to	the	 near 	 est 	 	life	-	 bear 	 ing 	 	planet	and	back	.
but	i	have	to	tell	you	--	and	sorry	,	richard	--	but	i	never	did	like	biology	field	 trip 	 s 	 	much	,	and	i	think	we	can	just	about	make	do	with	one	every	few	hundred	million	 year 	 s 	 	.
so	in	fact	,	 inter 	 galactic 	 	space	 do 	 es 	 	contain	all	the	 pre 	 requisite 	 s 	 	for	the	open	-	 end 	 ed 	 	creation	of	knowledge	.	any	 s 	 uch 	 	cube	,	 any 	 where 	 	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	could	 be 	 come 	 	the	same	kind	of	hub	that	we	are	,	if	the	knowledge	of	how	to	do	so	 we 	 re 	 	present	there	.
so	we	're	not	in	a	 un 	 ique 	 ly 	 	hospitable	place	.
if	 inter 	 galactic 	 	space	is	 cap 	 able 	 	of	creating	an	open	-	 end 	 ed 	 	stream	of	 explan 	 ations 	 	,	then	so	is	 al 	 most 	 	every	other	environment	.	so	is	the	earth	.	so	is	a	 pollute 	 d 	 	earth	.
and	the	 limit 	 ing 	 	factor	,	there	and	here	,	is	not	 resource 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 ple 	 nt 	 iful 	 	,	but	knowledge	,	which	is	scarce	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	 cosm 	 ic 	 	knowledge	-	based	view	may	--	and	i	think	ought	to	--	make	us	feel	 ver 	 y 	 	special	.	but	it	should	 al 	 so 	 	make	us	feel	 vulner 	 able 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	 with 	 out 	 	the	specific	knowledge	that	's	 need 	 ed 	 	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	the	 on 	 going 	 	 challeng 	 es 	 	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	we	wo	n't	 surviv 	 e 	 	them	.
all	it	 take 	 s 	 	is	for	a	supernova	to	go	off	a	few	light	 year 	 s 	 	away	,	and	we	'll	all	be	dead	!
martin	rees	 ha 	 s 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	written	a	book	about	our	 vulner 	 ability 	 	to	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	,	from	 astro 	 physics 	 	,	to	scientific	 experiment 	 s 	 	gone	wrong	,	and	most	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	to	 terror 	 ism 	 	with	 weapon 	 s 	 	of	mass	 destruct 	 ion 	 	.
and	he	 think 	 s 	 	that	 civil 	 ization 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	a	50	percent	chance	of	 surviv 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	century	.
i	think	he	's	going	to	talk	about	that	 lat 	 er 	 	in	the	 con 	 ference 	 	.
now	i	do	n't	think	that	 prob 	 ability 	 	is	the	right	 categor 	 y 	 	to	discuss	 th 	 is 	 	issue	in	.
but	i	do	agree	with	him	about	 th 	 is 	 	.	we	can	 surviv 	 e 	 	,	and	we	can	fail	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	.
but	it	 depend 	 s 	 	not	on	chance	,	but	on	 whet 	 her 	 	we	create	the	relevant	knowledge	in	time	.
the	danger	is	not	at	all	unprecedented	.	species	go	extinct	all	the	time	.
 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	end	.	the	 overwhelm 	 ing 	 	 major 	 ity 	 	of	all	species	and	all	 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	that	have	ever	 exist 	 ed 	 	are	now	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
and	if	we	want	to	be	the	exception	to	that	,	then	logically	our	 on 	 ly 	 	hope	is	to	make	use	of	the	one	feature	that	 distinguish 	 es 	 	our	species	,	and	our	 civil 	 ization 	 	,	from	all	the	 other 	 s 	 	--
 name 	 ly 	 	,	our	special	relationship	with	the	 law 	 s 	 	of	physics	,
our	ability	to	create	new	 explan 	 ations 	 	,	new	knowledge	--	to	be	a	hub	of	 exist 	 ence 	 	.
so	let	me	now	 app 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	to	a	current	 contr 	 over 	 s 	 y 	 	,	not	 be 	 cause 	 	i	want	to	 advoc 	 ate 	 	any	 part 	 icular 	 	solution	,	but	just	to	 illustr 	 ate 	 	the	kind	of	thing	i	mean	.
and	the	 contr 	 over 	 s 	 y 	 	is	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	.
now	,	i	'm	a	physicist	,	but	i	'm	not	the	right	kind	of	physicist	.	in	regard	to	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	,	i	'm	just	a	 lay 	 man 	 	.	and	the	rational	thing	for	a	 lay 	 man 	 	to	do	is	to	take	 serious 	 ly 	 	the	 prevail 	 ing 	 	scientific	 theor 	 y 	 	.	and	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	that	 theor 	 y 	 	,	it	's	 al 	 ready 	 	too	late	to	avoid	a	disaster	.
 be 	 cause 	 	if	it	's	true	that	our	best	option	at	the	moment	is	to	prevent	co	2	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	with	 some 	 thing 	 	like	the	kyoto	 proto 	 col 	 	,	with	 it 	 s 	 	 constraint 	 s 	 	on	economic	activity	and	 it 	 s 	 	enormous	cost	of	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	or	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	,	then	that	is	 al 	 ready 	 	a	disaster	by	any	 reason 	 able 	 	measure	.
and	the	 action 	 s 	 	that	are	 advoc 	 ated 	 	are	not	even	 pur 	 port 	 ed 	 	to	solve	the	problem	,
 mere 	 ly 	 	to	postpone	it	by	a	little	.	so	it	's	 al 	 ready 	 	too	late	to	avoid	it	,	and	it	 prob 	 ably 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	too	late	to	avoid	it	ever	since	before	 any 	 one 	 	 real 	 ized 	 	the	danger	.
it	was	 prob 	 ably 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	too	late	in	the	1970s	,	when	the	best	 avail 	 able 	 	scientific	 theor 	 y 	 	was	 tell 	 ing 	 	us	that	industrial	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	about	to	 precipit 	 ate 	 	a	new	ice	age	in	which	 billion 	 s 	 	would	die	.
now	the	 less 	 on 	 	of	that	 seem 	 s 	 	clear	to	me	,	and	i	do	n't	know	why	it	is	n't	 inform 	 ing 	 	public	debate	.
it	is	that	we	ca	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	know	.	when	we	know	of	an	 imp 	 end 	 ing 	 	disaster	,	and	how	to	solve	it	at	a	cost	less	than	the	cost	of	the	disaster	 it 	 self 	 	,	then	there	's	not	going	to	be	much	argument	,	 re 	 ally 	 	.
but	no	 pre 	 caution 	 s 	 	,	and	no	 pre 	 caution 	 ary 	 	principle	,	can	avoid	 problem 	 s 	 	that	we	do	not	yet	foresee	.
 h 	 ence 	 	,	we	need	a	stance	of	problem	-	 fix 	 ing 	 	,	not	just	problem	-	 avoid 	 ance 	 	.
and	it	's	true	that	an	ounce	of	 prevent 	 ion 	 	 equal 	 s 	 	a	pound	of	cure	,	but	that	's	 on 	 ly 	 	if	we	know	what	to	prevent	.
if	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	 punch 	 ed 	 	on	the	nose	,	then	the	science	of	medicine	 do 	 es 	 	not	consist	of	 teach 	 ing 	 	you	how	to	avoid	 punch 	 es 	 	.
if	medical	science	 stop 	 ped 	 	seeking	 cure 	 s 	 	and	 concent 	 rated 	 	on	 prevent 	 ion 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	,	then	it	would	 achiev 	 e 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	little	of	either	.
the	world	is	 buzz 	 ing 	 	at	the	moment	with	 plan 	 s 	 	to	force	 reduc 	 tions 	 	in	gas	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	at	all	 cost 	 s 	 	.
it	ought	to	be	 buzz 	 ing 	 	with	 plan 	 s 	 	to	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	temperature	,	and	with	 plan 	 s 	 	to	live	at	the	 high 	 er 	 	temperature	--
and	not	at	all	 cost 	 s 	 	,	but	 efficient 	 ly 	 	and	 cheap 	 ly 	 	.	and	some	 s 	 uch 	 	 plan 	 s 	 	exist	,	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 s 	 warm 	 s 	 	of	 mirror 	 s 	 	in	space	to	deflect	the	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	away	,	and	 encourag 	 ing 	 	 aqua 	 tic 	 	 organism 	 s 	 	to	eat	more	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	.
at	the	moment	,	these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	fringe	research	.
they	're	not	central	to	the	human	effort	to	face	 th 	 is 	 	problem	,	or	 problem 	 s 	 	in	general	.
and	with	 problem 	 s 	 	that	we	are	not	aware	of	yet	,	the	ability	to	put	right	--	not	the	 she 	 er 	 	good	luck	of	 avoid 	 ing 	 	 in 	 definite 	 ly 	 	--	is	our	 on 	 ly 	 	hope	,	not	just	of	solving	 problem 	 s 	 	,	but	of	 surviv 	 al 	 	.
so	take	two	stone	 table 	 ts 	 	,	and	carve	on	them	.
on	one	of	them	,	carve	:	``	 problem 	 s 	 	are	soluble	.	``
and	on	the	other	one	carve	:	``	 problem 	 s 	 	are	 inevit 	 able 	 	.	``
thank	you	.
