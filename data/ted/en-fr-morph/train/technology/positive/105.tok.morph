when	you	think	about	 resili 	 ence 	 	and	technology	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	much	 eas 	 ier 	 	.
you	're	going	to	see	some	other	 speaker 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	i	 al 	 ready 	 	know	,	who	are	going	to	talk	about	 break 	 ing 	 	-	 bone 	 s 	 	stuff	,	and	,	of	course	,	with	technology	it	never	is	.
so	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	,	 compar 	 ative 	 ly 	 	 s 	 peaking 	 	,	to	be	 resili 	 ent 	 	.	i	think	that	,	if	we	look	at	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	with	 s 	 uch 	 	an	 in 	 credible 	 	last	half	a	dozen	 year 	 s 	 	,	that	it	's	hard	to	even	get	the	right	 analog 	 y 	 	for	it	.
a	lot	of	how	we	decide	,	how	we	're	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	react	to	 thing 	 s 	 	and	what	we	're	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	expect	about	the	future	 depend 	 s 	 	on	how	we	 buck 	 et 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	and	how	we	 categor 	 ize 	 	them	.
and	so	i	think	the	 tempt 	 ing 	 	 analog 	 y 	 	for	the	boom	-	bust	that	we	just	went	through	with	the	 inter 	 net 	 	is	a	gold	rush	.	it	's	easy	to	think	of	 th 	 is 	 	 analog 	 y 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	different	from	some	of	the	other	 thing 	 s 	 	you	might	pick	.
for	one	thing	,	both	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	real	.
in	1849	,	in	that	gold	rush	,	they	took	over	$	700	million	worth	of	gold	out	of	california	.	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	real	.
the	 inter 	 net 	 	was	 al 	 so 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	real	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	real	way	for	 human 	 s 	 	to	communicate	with	each	other	.	it	's	a	big	deal	.
huge	boom	.	huge	boom	.	huge	bust	.	huge	bust	.
you	keep	going	,	and	both	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 lot 	 s 	 	of	hype	.
i	do	n't	have	to	 re 	 mind 	 	you	of	all	the	hype	that	was	 involve 	 d 	 	with	the	 inter 	 net 	 	--	like	getrich.com	.	but	you	had	the	same	thing	with	the	gold	rush	.	``	gold	.	gold	.	gold	.	``
sixty	-	eight	rich	men	on	the	steamer	portland	.	 stack 	 s 	 	of	yellow	metal	.
some	have	5,000	.	 man 	 y 	 	have	more	.
a	few	 br 	 ing 	 	out	100,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	each	.	people	would	get	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	when	they	read	these	 article 	 s 	 	.	``	the	eldorado	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	of	america	:

and	the	 parallel 	 s 	 	between	the	gold	rush	and	the	 inter 	 net 	 	rush	 continu 	 e 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 strong 	 ly 	 	.
so	 man 	 y 	 	people	left	what	they	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	.
and	what	would	happen	is	--	and	the	gold	rush	went	on	for	 year 	 s 	 	.	people	on	the	east	coast	in	1849	,	when	they	first	 start 	 ed 	 	to	get	the	news	,	they	thought	,	``	ah	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	real	.	``
but	they	keep	 hear 	 ing 	 	about	people	 get 	 ting 	 	rich	,	and	then	in	1850	they	still	hear	that	.	and	they	think	it	's	not	real	.
by	about	1852	,	they	're	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	am	i	the	 stupid 	 est 	 	person	on	earth	by	not	 rush 	 ing 	 	to	california	?	``	and	they	start	to	decide	they	are	.
these	are	community	 af 	 fair 	 s 	 	,	by	the	way	.
local	 commun 	 ities 	 	on	the	east	coast	would	get	together	and	whole	 team 	 s 	 	of	10	,	20	people	would	 car 	 a 	 van 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	and	they	would	form	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.
these	 we 	 re 	 	 typical 	 ly 	 	not	 so 	 lit 	 ary 	 	 effort 	 s 	 	.	but	no	matter	what	,	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	a	lawyer	or	a	 bank 	 er 	 	,	people	 drop 	 ped 	 	what	they	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	,	no	matter	what	skill	set	they	had	,	to	go	pan	for	gold	.
 th 	 is 	 	guy	on	the	left	,	dr.	richard	beverley	cole	,	he	lived	in	philadelphia	and	he	took	the	panama	route	.
they	would	take	a	ship	down	to	panama	,	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 is 	 th 	 mus 	 	,	and	then	take	 an 	 other 	 	ship	north	.	 th 	 is 	 	guy	,	dr.	toland	,	went	by	 cover 	 ed 	 	wagon	to	california	.	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 parallel 	 s 	 	,	too	.	 doctor 	 s 	 	 leav 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 practice 	 s 	 	.

in	the	gold	rush	,	people	 liter 	 ally 	 	 jump 	 ed 	 	ship	.
the	san	francisco	harbor	was	 clog 	 ged 	 	with	600	 ship 	 s 	 	at	the	peak	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 ship 	 s 	 	would	get	there	and	the	 crew 	 s 	 	would	abandon	to	go	search	for	gold	.
so	there	 we 	 re 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	600	 cap 	 tain 	 s 	 	and	600	 ship 	 s 	 	.
they	 turn 	 ed 	 	the	 ship 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 hotel 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	could	n't	sail	them	 any 	 where 	 	.

the	fort	in	san	francisco	at	the	time	had	about	1,300	 soldier 	 s 	 	.
half	of	them	 desert 	 ed 	 	to	go	look	for	gold	.

and	one	of	the	 soldier 	 s 	 	wrote	home	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	sentence	that	he	put	:	``	the	struggle	between	right	and	six	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	month	and	wrong	and	75	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	day	is	a	 ra 	 ther 	 	severe	one	.	``
they	had	bad	burn	rate	in	the	gold	rush	.	a	 ver 	 y 	 	bad	burn	rate	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	from	the	klondike	gold	rush	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	white	pass	trail	.

even	 th 	 ough 	 	,	at	the	time	,	they	 on 	 ly 	 	had	a	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	annual	revenue	.
now	,	here	's	where	our	 analog 	 y 	 	with	the	gold	rush	 start 	 s 	 	to	diverge	,	and	i	think	 ra 	 ther 	 	 severe 	 ly 	 	.
and	that	is	,	in	a	gold	rush	,	when	it	's	over	,	it	's	over	.
here	's	 th 	 is 	 	guy	:	``	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	men	in	dawson	at	the	present	time	who	feel	 keen 	 ly 	 	 disappoint 	 ed 	 	.	they	've	come	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 mile 	 s 	 	on	a	 peril 	 ous 	 	trip	,	 risk 	 ed 	 	life	,	health	and	 proper 	 ty 	 	,	 s 	 pent 	 	 month 	 s 	 	of	the	most	 ard 	 uous 	 	labor	a	man	can	perform	and	at	length	with	 expect 	 ations 	 	raised	to	the	highest	pitch	have	 reach 	 ed 	 	the	 cove 	 ted 	 	goal	 on 	 ly 	 	to	discover	the	fact	that	there	is	 noth 	 ing 	 	here	for	them	.	``
and	that	was	,	of	course	,	the	 ver 	 y 	 	common	story	.
 be 	 cause 	 	when	you	take	out	that	last	piece	of	gold	--	and	they	did	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.	i	mean	,	if	you	look	at	the	1849	gold	rush	--	the	entire	american	river	region	,	 with 	 in 	 	two	 year 	 s 	 	--	every	stone	had	 be 	 en 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	.	and	after	that	,	 on 	 ly 	 	big	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	who	used	more	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	 min 	 ing 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	to	take	gold	out	of	there	.
so	there	's	a	much	better	 analog 	 y 	 	that	 allow 	 s 	 	you	to	be	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 optimist 	 ic 	 	and	that	 analog 	 y 	 	is	the	electric	industry	.	and	there	are	a	lot	of	 similar 	 ities 	 	between	the	 inter 	 net 	 	and	the	electric	industry	.
with	the	electric	industry	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	to	--	one	of	them	is	that	they	're	both	sort	of	thin	,	 horizon 	 tal 	 	,	 enabl 	 ing 	 	 layer 	 s 	 	that	go	 a 	 cross 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	different	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	.
it	's	not	a	specific	thing	.
but	 electric 	 ity 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	broad	,	so	you	have	to	sort	of	narrow	it	down	.	you	know	,	it	can	be	used	 a 	 s 	 	an	 in 	 credible 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	of	 transmit 	 ting 	 	power	.	it	's	an	 in 	 credible 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	of	 coordi 	 nating 	 	,	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	fine	-	grained	way	,	information	 flow 	 s 	 	.
there	's	a	bunch	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 interest 	 ing 	 	about	 electric 	 ity 	 	.	and	the	part	of	the	electric	revolution	that	i	want	to	focus	on	is	sort	of	the	 gold 	 en 	 	age	of	 appli 	 ance 	 s 	 	.
the	killer	app	that	got	the	world	ready	for	 appli 	 ance 	 s 	 	was	the	light	bulb	.
so	the	light	bulb	is	what	wired	the	world	.
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 appli 	 ance 	 s 	 	when	they	wired	the	world	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	--	they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 put 	 ting 	 	 electric 	 ity 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	home	;
they	 we 	 re 	 	 put 	 ting 	 	 light 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	home	.
and	,	but	it	 re 	 ally 	 	--	it	got	the	 electric 	 ity 	 	.	it	took	a	long	time	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	huge	--	 a 	 s 	 	you	would	expect	--	a	huge	capital	build	out	.	all	the	 street 	 s 	 	had	to	be	torn	up	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	work	going	on	down	in	lower	manhattan	where	they	built	some	of	the	first	electric	power	generating	 station 	 s 	 	.
and	they	're	 tear 	 ing 	 	up	all	the	 street 	 s 	 	.
the	edison	electric	company	,	which	 be 	 came 	 	edison	general	electric	,	which	 be 	 came 	 	general	electric	,	paid	for	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	 dig 	 ging 	 	up	of	the	 street 	 s 	 	.	it	was	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	expensive	.
but	that	is	not	the	--	and	that	's	not	the	part	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	most	similar	to	the	web	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	remember	,	the	web	got	to	stand	on	top	of	all	 th 	 is 	 	heavy	 infra 	 structure 	 	that	had	 be 	 en 	 	put	in	place	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	long	-	distance	phone	network	.
so	all	of	the	 ca 	 bling 	 	and	all	of	the	heavy	 infra 	 structure 	 	--	i	'm	going	back	now	to	,	sort	of	,	the	explosive	part	of	the	web	in	1994	,	when	it	was	growing	2,300	percent	a	year	.
how	could	it	grow	at	2,300	percent	a	year	in	1994	when	people	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 invest 	 ing 	 	in	the	web	?
well	,	it	was	 be 	 cause 	 	that	heavy	 infra 	 structure 	 	had	 al 	 ready 	 	 be 	 en 	 	laid	down	.
so	the	light	bulb	laid	down	the	heavy	 infra 	 structure 	 	,	and	then	home	 appli 	 ance 	 s 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	coming	 in 	 to 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	huge	.	the	first	one	was	the	electric	fan	--	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	1890	electric	fan	.
and	the	 appli 	 ance 	 s 	 	,	the	 gold 	 en 	 	age	of	 appli 	 ance 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 last 	 ed 	 	--
it	 depend 	 s 	 	how	you	want	to	measure	it	--	but	it	's	 any 	 where 	 	from	40	to	60	 year 	 s 	 	.	it	 go 	 es 	 	on	a	long	time	.
it	 start 	 s 	 	about	1890	.	and	the	electric	fan	was	a	big	success	.
the	electric	iron	,	 al 	 so 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	big	.
by	the	way	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	asbestos	 law 	 suit 	 	.
there	's	asbestos	under	that	handle	there	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	vacuum	 clean 	 er 	 	,	the	1905	skinner	vacuum	,
from	the	 ho 	 over 	 	company	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	one	 weigh 	 ed 	 	92	 pound 	 s 	 
and	took	two	people	to	 oper 	 ate 	 	and	cost	a	quarter	of	a	car	.
so	it	was	n't	a	big	seller	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	 tru 	 ly 	 	,	 tru 	 ly 	 	an	early	-	adopter	product	--
the	1905	skinner	vacuum	.
but	three	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	by	1908	,	it	 weigh 	 ed 	 	40	 pound 	 s 	 	.	now	,	not	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 high 	 ly 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	electric	tie	press	,	which	never	 re 	 ally 	 	did	catch	on	.
people	,	i	guess	,	 decide 	 d 	 	that	they	would	not	 wrinkl 	 e 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	ties	.
these	never	 re 	 ally 	 	caught	on	either	:	the	electric	shoe	 warm 	 er 	 	and	 d 	 rier 	 	.	never	a	big	seller	.
 th 	 is 	 	came	in	,	like	,	six	different	 color 	 s 	 	.
i	do	n't	know	why	.	but	i	thought	,	you	know	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	it	's	just	not	the	right	time	for	an	 invent 	 ion 	 	;
 may 	 be 	 	it	's	time	to	give	 th 	 is 	 	one	 an 	 other 	 	shot	.
so	i	thought	we	could	build	a	super	bowl	ad	for	 th 	 is 	 	.
we	'd	need	the	right	partner	.	and	i	thought	that	 re 	 ally 	 	--	i	thought	that	would	 re 	 ally 	 	work	,	to	give	that	 an 	 other 	 	shot	.
now	,	the	 toast 	 er 	 	was	huge	 be 	 cause 	 	they	used	to	make	toast	on	open	 fire 	 s 	 	,	and	it	took	a	lot	of	time	and	attention	.
i	want	to	point	out	one	thing	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	--	you	 guy 	 s 	 	know	what	 th 	 is 	 	is	.
they	had	n't	 invent 	 ed 	 	the	electric	socket	yet	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	was	--	remember	,	they	did	n't	wire	the	 house 	 s 	 	for	 electric 	 ity 	 	.
they	wired	them	for	 light 	 ing 	 	.	so	your	--	your	 appli 	 ance 	 s 	 	would	plug	in	.
they	would	--	each	room	 typical 	 ly 	 	had	a	light	bulb	socket	at	the	top	.
and	you	'd	plug	it	in	there	.
in	fact	,	if	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	the	carousel	of	progress	at	disney	world	,	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.	here	are	the	 cable 	 s 	 	coming	up	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	light	 fix 	 ture 	 	.
all	the	 appli 	 ance 	 s 	 	plug	in	there	.	and	you	would	just	 un 	 screw 	 	your	light	bulb	if	you	 want 	 ed 	 	to	plug	in	an	 appli 	 ance 	 	.
the	next	thing	that	 re 	 ally 	 	was	a	big	,	big	deal	was	the	 wash 	 ing 	 	machine	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	an	object	of	much	 en 	 vy 	 	and	lust	.
 every 	 body 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	one	of	these	electric	 wash 	 ing 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	.
on	the	left	-	hand	side	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	 soap 	 y 	 	water	.
and	there	's	a	rotor	there	--	that	 th 	 is 	 	motor	is	 s 	 pinning 	 	.
and	it	would	clean	your	 clothe 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	clean	rinse	-	water	.	so	you	'd	take	the	 clothe 	 s 	 	out	of	here	,	put	them	in	here	,	and	then	you	'd	run	the	 clothe 	 s 	 	through	 th 	 is 	 	electric	 ring 	 er 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	big	deal	.
you	'd	keep	 th 	 is 	 	on	your	porch	.	it	was	a	little	bit	 mess 	 y 	 	and	kind	of	a	pain	.
and	you	'd	run	a	long	cord	 in 	 to 	 	the	house	where	you	could	screw	it	 in 	 to 	 	your	light	socket	.
and	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	kind	of	an	 import 	 ant 	 	point	in	my	 present 	 ation 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	had	n't	 invent 	 ed 	 	the	off	 s 	 witch 	 	.
that	was	to	come	much	 lat 	 er 	 	--	the	off	 s 	 witch 	 	on	 appli 	 ance 	 s 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	it	did	n't	make	any	sense	.
i	mean	,	you	did	n't	want	 th 	 is 	 	thing	 c 	 logging 	 	up	a	light	socket	.
so	you	know	,	when	you	 we 	 re 	 	 d 	 one 	 	with	it	,	you	 un 	 screw 	 ed 	 	it	.
that	's	what	you	did	.	you	did	n't	turn	it	off	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	before	,	they	had	n't	 invent 	 ed 	 	the	electric	 out 	 let 	 	either	,	so	the	 wash 	 ing 	 	machine	was	a	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	.
and	there	are	--	when	you	research	 th 	 is 	 	,	there	are	gruesome	 de 	 script 	 ions 	 	of	people	 get 	 ting 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	hair	and	 clothe 	 s 	 	caught	in	these	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	.
and	they	could	n't	yank	the	cord	out	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	 screw 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	light	socket	 in 	 side 	 	the	house	.
and	there	was	no	off	 s 	 witch 	 	,	so	it	was	n't	 ver 	 y 	 	good	.
and	you	might	think	that	that	was	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	stupid	of	our	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	to	be	 plug 	 ging 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	light	socket	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	,	you	know	,	before	i	get	too	far	 in 	 to 	 	 condemn 	 ing 	 	our	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	,	i	thought	i	'd	show	you	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	 con 	 ference 	 	room	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	total	kludge	,	if	you	ask	me	.
first	of	all	,	 th 	 is 	 	got	 install 	 ed 	 	 up 	 side 	 	down	.	 th 	 is 	 	light	socket	--	and	so	the	cord	 keep 	 s 	 	 fall 	 ing 	 	out	,	so	i	taped	it	in	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 suppose 	 d 	 	--	do	n't	even	get	me	 start 	 ed 	 	.	but	that	's	not	the	worst	one	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	under	my	desk	.
i	took	 th 	 is 	 	picture	just	two	 day 	 s 	 	ago	.
so	we	 re 	 ally 	 	have	n't	 progress 	 ed 	 	that	much	since	1908	.
it	's	a	total	,	total	mess	.
and	,	you	know	,	we	think	it	's	 get 	 ting 	 	better	,	but	have	you	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	install	802.11	 your 	 self 	 	?
i	 challeng 	 e 	 	you	to	try	.	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	.
i	know	ph	.	d.	s	in	computer	science	--	 th 	 is 	 	process	 ha 	 s 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	them	to	 tear 	 s 	 	,	absolute	 tear 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	 assum 	 ing 	 	you	 al 	 ready 	 	have	dsl	in	your	house	.
try	to	get	dsl	 install 	 ed 	 	in	your	house	.
the	 engineer 	 s 	 	who	do	it	 every 	 day 	 	ca	n't	do	it	.
they	have	to	--	 typical 	 ly 	 	,	they	come	three	 time 	 s 	 	.
and	one	friend	of	mine	was	 tell 	 ing 	 	me	a	story	:
not	 on 	 ly 	 	did	they	get	there	and	have	to	wait	,	but	then	the	 engineer 	 s 	 	,	when	they	 final 	 ly 	 	did	get	there	,	for	the	third	time	,	they	had	to	call	 some 	 body 	 	.
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	happy	that	the	guy	had	a	 speaker 	 phone 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	then	they	had	to	wait	on	hold	for	an	hour	to	talk	to	 some 	 body 	 	to	give	them	an	access	code	after	they	got	there	.
so	we	're	not	--	we	're	 pre 	 tty 	 	kludge	-	y	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
by	the	way	,	dsl	is	a	kludge	.
i	mean	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 twist 	 ed 	 	pair	of	 cop 	 per 	 	that	was	never	designed	for	the	purpose	it	's	 be 	 ing 	 	put	to	--
you	know	it	's	the	whole	thing	--
we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	primitive	.	and	that	's	kind	of	the	point	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	you	know	,	 resili 	 ence 	 	--	if	you	think	of	it	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	gold	rush	,	then	you	'd	be	 pre 	 tty 	 	 depress 	 ed 	 	right	now
 be 	 cause 	 	the	last	nugget	of	gold	would	be	gone	.
but	the	good	thing	is	,	with	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	there	is	n't	a	last	nugget	.
every	new	thing	 create 	 s 	 	two	new	 question 	 s 	 	and	two	new	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	.
and	if	you	 believ 	 e 	 	that	,	then	you	 believ 	 e 	 	that	where	we	are	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	think	--	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	where	we	are	with	the	 in 	 credible 	 	kludge	--	and	i	have	n't	even	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	user	 inter 	 face 	 s 	 	on	the	web	--
but	there	's	so	much	kludge	,	so	much	 terr 	 ible 	 	stuff	--	we	are	at	the	1908	hurley	 wash 	 ing 	 	machine	stage	with	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
that	's	where	we	are	.	we	do	n't	get	our	hair	caught	in	it	,	but	that	's	the	level	of	 primitive 	 ness 	 	of	where	we	are	.
we	're	in	1908	.	and	if	you	 believ 	 e 	 	that	,	then	stuff	like	 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 both 	 er 	 	you	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	1996	:	``	all	the	 negative 	 s 	 	add	up	to	making	the	 on 	 line 	 	experience	not	worth	the	trouble	.	``
1998	:	``	amazon	.	toast	.	``	in	1999	:	``	amazon	.	bomb	.	``
my	mom	 hate 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	picture	.
she	--	but	you	know	,	if	you	 re 	 ally 	 	do	 believ 	 e 	 	that	it	's	the	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	if	you	 believ 	 e 	 	it	's	the	1908	hurley	 wash 	 ing 	 	machine	,	then	you	're	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 optimist 	 ic 	 	.	and	i	do	think	that	that	's	where	we	are	.
and	i	do	think	there	's	more	 innov 	 ation 	 	 a 	 head 	 	of	us
than	there	is	 be 	 hind 	 	us	.
and	in	1917	,	sears	--	i	want	to	get	 th 	 is 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	right	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	the	 advertise 	 ment 	 	that	they	ran	in	1917	.
it	 say 	 s 	 	:	``	use	your	 electric 	 ity 	 	for	more	than	light	.	``
and	i	think	that	's	where	we	are	.	we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	early	.	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
