i	'm	kind	of	 tire 	 d 	 	of	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 simpl 	 icity 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,
so	i	thought	i	'd	make	my	life	more	complex	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	serious	play	.
so	,	i	'm	going	to	,	like	,	go	through	some	 slide 	 s 	 	from	way	back	when	,	and	walk	through	them	to	give	you	a	sense	of	how	i	end	up	here	.
so	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	it	all	 beg 	 an 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	whole	idea	of	a	computer	.
who	 ha 	 s 	 	a	computer	?	 yea 	 h 	 	.
o.k	.	,	so	,	 every 	 one 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	computer	.
even	a	mobile	phone	,	it	's	a	computer	.
and	--	 any 	 one 	 	remember	 th 	 is 	 	 work 	 book 	 	,
``	instant	 activ 	 ities 	 	for	your	apple	``	--	free	 post 	 er 	 	in	each	book	?
 th 	 is 	 	was	how	computing	 beg 	 an 	 	.
do	n't	forget	:	a	computer	came	out	;	it	had	no	 soft 	 ware 	 	.
you	'd	buy	that	thing	,	you	'd	 br 	 ing 	 	it	home	,	you	'd	plug	it	in	,	and	it	would	do	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	at	all	.
so	,	you	had	to	program	it	,	and	there	 we 	 re 	 	great	 programm 	 ing 	 	,	like	,	 tutor 	 ial 	 s 	 	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	mean	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	great	.
it	's	,	like	,	you	know	,	herbie	the	apple	ii	.	it	's	 s 	 uch 	 	a	great	way	to	--	i	mean	,	they	should	make	java	 book 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	we	've	have	no	problem	 learn 	 ing 	 	a	program	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	great	,	grand	time	of	the	computer	,	when	it	was	just	a	raw	,	raw	,	what	is	it	?	kind	of	an	era	.
and	,	you	see	,	 th 	 is 	 	era	 coincide 	 d 	 	with	my	own	 child 	 hood 	 	.
i	grew	up	in	a	 to 	 fu 	 	 factor 	 y 	 	in	seattle	.
who	of	you	grew	up	in	a	family	business	,
 suffer 	 ed 	 	the	torture	?	 y 	 es 	 	,	 y 	 es 	 	.
the	torture	was	good	.	was	n't	it	good	torture	?
it	was	just	life	-	changing	,	you	know	.	and	so	,	in	my	life	,	you	know	,	i	was	in	the	 to 	 fu 	 	;	it	was	a	family	business	.
and	my	mother	was	a	kind	of	a	 design 	 er 	 	,	 al 	 so 	 	.
she	'd	make	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	,	like	,	wall	of	 to 	 fu 	 	 cook 	 ing 	 	,	and	it	would	 con 	 fuse 	 	the	 custom 	 ers 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	all	thought	it	was	a	restaurant	.
a	bad	sort	of	 brand 	 ing 	 	thing	,	or	 what 	 ever 	 	.
but	,	 any 	 way 	 	,	that	's	where	i	grew	up	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	little	 to 	 fu 	 	 factor 	 y 	 	in	seattle	,	and	it	was	kind	of	like	 th 	 is 	 	:	a	small	room	where	i	kind	of	grew	up	.	i	'm	big	there	in	that	picture	.
that	's	my	dad	.	my	dad	was	kind	of	like	macgyver	,	 re 	 ally 	 	:	he	would	invent	,	like	,	ways	to	make	 thing 	 s 	 	heavy	.
like	back	here	,	there	's	like	,	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	block	technology	here	,	and	he	would	need	the	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	 block 	 s 	 	to	press	the	 to 	 fu 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 to 	 fu 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	kind	of	a	 liquid 	 y 	 	type	of	thing	,	and	so	you	have	to	have	heavy	stuff	to	push	out	the	liquid	and	make	it	hard	.
 to 	 fu 	 	 come 	 s 	 	out	in	these	big	 batch 	 es 	 	,	and	my	father	would	sort	of	cut	them	by	hand	.
i	ca	n't	tell	you	--	family	business	story	:	you	'd	understand	 th 	 is 	 	--	my	father	was	the	most	 since 	 re 	 	man	possible	.
he	 walk 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	safeway	once	on	a	 rain 	 y 	 	day	,	 s 	 lipped 	 	,	broke	his	arm	,	 rush 	 ed 	 	out	:
he	did	n't	want	to	 in 	 convenience 	 	safeway	.
so	,	 in 	 stead 	 	,	you	know	,	my	father	's	,	like	,	arm	's	broken	for	two	 week 	 s 	 	in	the	store	,	and	that	week	--	now	,	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 week 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	when	my	 old 	 er 	 	brother	and	i	had	to	do	 every 	 thing 	 	.
and	that	was	torture	,	real	torture	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	you	see	,	we	'd	 s 	 een 	 	my	father	taking	the	big	block	of	 to 	 fu 	 	and	cutting	it	,	like	,	knife	in	,	zap	,	zap	,	zap	.	we	thought	,	 w 	 ow 	 	.
so	,	the	first	time	i	did	that	,	i	went	,	like	,	 who 	 a 	 	!	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
bad	 block 	 s 	 	.	but	 any 	 ways 	 	,	the	 to 	 fu 	 	to	me	was	kind	of	my	origin	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	in	a	store	was	so	hard	,	i	 like 	 d 	 	going	to	school	;	it	was	like	heaven	.
and	i	was	 re 	 ally 	 	good	at	school	.
so	,	when	i	got	to	mit	,	you	know	,	 a 	 s 	 	most	of	you	who	are	 creative 	 s 	 	,	your	 parent 	 s 	 	all	told	you	not	to	be	creative	,	right	?
so	,	same	way	,	you	know	,	i	was	good	at	art	and	good	at	math	,	and	my	father	 say 	 s 	 	,	he	's	--	john	's	good	at	math	.
i	went	to	mit	,	did	my	math	,	but	i	had	 th 	 is 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	had	just	 be 	 come 	 	visual	.
the	apple	--	macintosh	just	came	out	;	i	had	a	mac	in	hand	when	i	went	to	mit	.	and	it	was	a	time	when	a	guy	who	,	kind	of	,	could	cross	the	two	 side 	 s 	 	--	it	was	a	good	time	.
and	so	,	i	remember	that	my	first	major	piece	of	 soft 	 ware 	 	was	on	a	direct	copy	of	then	-	aldus	pagemaker	.
i	made	a	 desk 	 top 	 	 publish 	 ing 	 	system	way	back	when	,	and	that	was	,	kind	of	,	my	first	step	 in 	 to 	 	 figur 	 ing 	 	out	how	to	--	oh	,	these	two	 side 	 s 	 	are	kind	of	 f 	 un 	 	to	mix	.
and	the	problem	when	you	're	 young 	 er 	 	--	for	all	you	 student 	 s 	 	out	there	--	is	,	your	head	 get 	 s 	 	kind	of	big	 re 	 ally 	 	easy	.
and	when	i	was	making	 icon 	 s 	 	,	i	was	,	like	,	the	icon	master	,	and	i	was	,	like	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	good	at	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	know	.
and	then	 luck 	 ily 	 	,	you	know	,	i	had	the	fortune	of	going	to	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	a	library	,	and	in	the	library	i	came	 up 	 on 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	book	.	i	found	 th 	 is 	 	book	.	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	,	``	 thought 	 s 	 	on	design	,	``	by	a	man	named	paul	rand	.
it	's	a	little	 s 	 lim 	 	volume	;	i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	if	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	nice	little	book	.	it	's	about	 th 	 is 	 	guy	,	paul	rand	,	who	was	one	of	the	 great 	 est 	 	graphic	 design 	 ers 	 	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	a	great	writer	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
and	when	i	saw	 th 	 is 	 	man	's	work	,	i	 real 	 ized 	 	how	bad	i	was	at	design	,	or	 what 	 ever 	 	i	 call 	 ed 	 	it	back	then	,	and	i	 sudden 	 ly 	 	had	a	kind	of	 care 	 er 	 	goal	,	kind	of	in	hot	 pur 	 suit 	 	.
so	i	kind	of	 s 	 witch 	 ed 	 	.	i	went	to	mit	,	 finish 	 ed 	 	.
i	got	my	 master 	 s 	 	,	and	then	went	to	art	school	after	that	.
and	just	 beg 	 an 	 	to	design	stuff	,	like	 chop 	 stick 	 	 wrap 	 per 	 s 	 	,	 napkin 	 s 	 	,	 menu 	 s 	 	--	 what 	 ever 	 	i	could	get	a	handle	on	:	sort	of	wheel	-	and	-	deal	,	move	up	in	the	design	world	,	 what 	 ever 	 	.
and	is	n't	it	that	strange	moment	when	you	publish	your	design	?
remember	that	moment	--	 publish 	 ing 	 	your	 design 	 s 	 	?
remember	that	moment	?	it	felt	so	good	,	did	n't	it	?
so	,	i	was	 publish 	 ed 	 	,	you	know	,	so	,	 w 	 ow 	 	,	my	design	's	in	a	book	,	you	know	?
after	that	,	 thing 	 s 	 	kind	of	got	strange	,	and	i	got	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	computer	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	computer	to	me	 al 	 ways 	 	,	kind	of	,	 both 	 er 	 ed 	 	me	.
i	did	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	get	it	.	and	paul	rand	was	a	kind	of	 crust 	 y 	 	 design 	 er 	 	,	you	know	,	a	 crust 	 y 	 	 design 	 er 	 	,	like	a	good	--	kind	of	like	a	good	french	bread	?
you	know	,	he	wrote	in	one	of	his	 book 	 s 	 	:	``	a	yale	student	once	 s 	 aid 	 	,	'	i	came	here	to	learn	how	to	design	,	not	how	to	use	a	computer	.	'	design	 school 	 s 	 	take	 he 	 ed 	 	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	in	the	'80s	,	in	the	great	 c 	 lash 	 	of	computer	/	non	-	computer	people	.
a	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	time	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	to	me	was	an	 import 	 ant 	 	 mess 	 age 	 	from	rand	.
and	so	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	sort	of	mess	with	the	computer	at	the	time	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	sort	of	play	thing	i	did	,	my	own	serious	play	.
i	built	a	 work 	 ing 	 	version	of	an	adobe	 illustr 	 ator 	 	-	ish	thing	.
it	 look 	 s 	 	like	 illustr 	 ator 	 	;	it	can	,	like	,	draw	.
it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
it	took	a	month	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	part	.
and	then	i	thought	,	what	if	i	 add 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	feature	,	where	i	can	say	,	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	you	can	fly	like	a	bird	.	you	're	free	,	kind	of	thing	.
so	i	could	,	sort	of	,	change	the	kind	of	 st 	 ability 	 	with	a	little	control	there	on	the	dial	,	and	i	can	sort	of	watch	it	flip	around	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	in	1993	.
and	when	my	 professor 	 s 	 	saw	 th 	 is 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 up 	 set 	 	at	me	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	why	's	it	moving	?
they	 we 	 re 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	make	it	stop	now	.
now	,	i	was	 say 	 ing 	 	,	well	,	that	's	the	whole	point	:	it	's	moving	.
and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	well	,	when	's	it	going	to	stop	?
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	never	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	even	 wo 	 rse 	 	.	stop	it	now	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	whole	idea	,	of	like	,	what	is	 th 	 is 	 	computer	?	it	's	a	strange	medium	.
it	's	not	like	print	.	it	's	not	like	video	.
it	 last 	 s 	 	 fore 	 ver 	 	.	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	strange	medium	.
so	,	i	went	off	with	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	 beg 	 an 	 	to	look	for	 thing 	 s 	 	even	more	.
and	so	in	japan	,	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	experiment	with	people	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	bad	:	human	 experiment 	 s 	 	.
i	would	do	these	 thing 	 s 	 	where	i	'd	have	 student 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 pen 	 s 	 	:	there	's	blue	pen	,	red	pen	,	green	pen	,	black	pen	.
and	 some 	 one 	 	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	down	and	 draw 	 s 	 	a	picture	.
they	're	 laugh 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	draw	from	the	middle	-	right	to	the	middle	,	and	he	kind	of	 mess 	 ed 	 	up	.
see	,	 human 	 s 	 	do	n't	know	how	to	take	 order 	 s 	 	;	the	computer	's	so	good	at	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	guy	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	how	to	get	the	computer	to	draw	with	two	 pen 	 s 	 	at	once	:	you	know	,	you	,	pen	,	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	you	,	pen	,	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	so	 beg 	 an 	 	to	have	 multi 	 ple 	 	 pen 	 s 	 	on	the	page	--	 aga 	 in 	 	,	hard	to	do	with	our	 hand 	 s 	 	.
and	then	 some 	 one 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	``	a	-	ha	moment	``	where	you	could	use	coordinate	 system 	 s 	 	.
we	thought	,	ah	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	when	it	's	going	to	happen	.
in	the	end	,	he	drew	a	house	.	it	was	the	most	 bor 	 ing 	 	thing	.
it	 be 	 came 	 	 computer 	 ish 	 	;	we	 beg 	 an 	 	to	think	 computer 	 ish 	 	--	the	x	,	y	system	--	and	so	that	was	kind	of	a	 revel 	 ation 	 	.
and	after	 th 	 is 	 	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	build	a	computer	out	of	people	,	 call 	 ed 	 	a	human	-	powered	computer	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	1993	.
sound	down	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	.
it	's	a	computer	where	the	people	are	the	 part 	 s 	 	.	i	have	 be 	 hind 	 	 th 	 is 	 	wall	a	 dis 	 k 	 	drive	,	a	cpu	,	a	 graphic 	 s 	 	card	,	a	 memor 	 y 	 	system	.	they	're	 pick 	 ing 	 	up	a	giant	 flop 	 py 	 	 dis 	 k 	 	made	of	 card 	 board 	 	.
it	's	put	 in 	 side 	 	the	computer	.
and	that	little	program	's	on	that	 card 	 board 	 	 dis 	 k 	 	.
so	,	she	 wear 	 s 	 	the	 dis 	 k 	 	,	and	 read 	 s 	 	the	data	off	the	 sector 	 s 	 	of	the	 dis 	 k 	 	,	and	the	computer	 start 	 s 	 	up	;	it	sort	of	 boot 	 s 	 	up	,	 re 	 ally 	 	.
and	it	's	a	sort	of	a	 work 	 ing 	 	computer	.	and	when	i	built	 th 	 is 	 	computer	,	i	had	a	moment	of	--	what	is	it	 call 	 ed 	 	?	--	the	 epiph 	 any 	 	where	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	the	computer	's	just	so	fast	.
 th 	 is 	 	computer	 appear 	 s 	 	to	be	fast	-	she	's	 work 	 ing 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	hard	,	and	people	are	running	around	,	and	we	think	,	 w 	 ow 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	at	a	fast	rate	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	computer	's	 programm 	 ed 	 	to	do	 on 	 ly 	 	one	thing	,	which	is	,	if	you	move	your	mouse	,	the	mouse	 change 	 s 	 	on	the	screen	.
on	the	computer	,	when	you	move	your	mouse	,	that	arrow	 move 	 s 	 	around	.
on	 th 	 is 	 	computer	,	if	you	move	the	mouse	,	it	 take 	 s 	 	half	an	hour	for	the	mouse	cursor	to	change	.
to	give	you	a	sense	of	the	speed	,	the	scale	:	the	computer	is	just	so	 amaz 	 ing 	 ly 	 	fast	,	o.k	.	?
and	so	,	after	 th 	 is 	 	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	do	 experiment 	 s 	 	for	different	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	i	did	for	sony	in	1996	.
it	was	three	sony	``	h	``	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	that	 respond 	 ed 	 	to	sound	.
so	,	if	you	talk	 in 	 to 	 	the	 mi 	 ke 	 	,	you	'll	hear	some	music	in	your	 head 	 phone 	 s 	 	;	if	you	talk	in	the	phone	,	then	video	would	happen	.
so	,	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	experiment	with	industry	in	different	ways	with	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 mix 	 ture 	 	of	 skill 	 s 	 	.
i	did	 th 	 is 	 	ad	.	i	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	alcohol	,	but	i	do	drink	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	.
and	chanel	.	so	,	 get 	 ting 	 	to	do	different	 project 	 s 	 	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	,	one	thing	i	 real 	 ized 	 	is	that	i	like	to	make	 thing 	 s 	 	.
we	like	to	make	 thing 	 s 	 	.	it	's	 f 	 un 	 	to	make	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	so	i	never	 develop 	 ed 	 	the	ability	to	have	a	staff	.
i	have	no	staff	;	it	's	all	kind	of	made	by	hand	--	these	sort	of	broken	 hand 	 s 	 	.
and	these	 hand 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 influence 	 d 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	man	,	mr.	inami	naomi	.
 th 	 is 	 	guy	was	my	kind	of	like	mentor	.
he	was	the	first	digital	media	 produce 	 r 	 	in	tokyo	.
he	's	the	guy	that	kind	of	 discover 	 ed 	 	me	,	and	kind	of	got	me	going	in	digital	media	.
he	was	 s 	 uch 	 	an	 inspiration 	 al 	 	guy	.
i	remember	,	like	,	we	'd	be	in	his	studio	,	like	,	at	2	 a.m 	 . 	 	,	and	then	he	'd	show	up	from	some	client	 meet 	 ing 	 	.
he	'd	come	in	and	say	,	you	know	,	if	i	am	here	,	 every 	 thing 	 	is	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
and	you	'd	feel	so	much	better	,	you	know	.
and	i	'll	never	forget	how	,	like	,	but	--	i	'll	never	forget	how	,	like	,	he	had	a	sudden	 situ 	 ation 	 	with	his	--	he	had	an	aneurysm	.
he	went	 in 	 to 	 	a	 com 	 a 	 	.
and	so	,	for	three	 year 	 s 	 	he	was	out	,	and	he	could	 on 	 ly 	 	blink	,	and	so	i	 real 	 ized 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	moment	,	i	thought	,	 w 	 ow 	 	--	how	fragile	is	 th 	 is 	 	thing	we	're	 wear 	 ing 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	body	and	mind	we	're	 wear 	 ing 	 	,	and	so	i	thought	,	how	do	you	go	for	it	more	?
how	do	you	take	that	time	you	have	left	and	go	after	it	?
so	,	naomi	was	 pivot 	 al 	 	in	that	.
and	so	,	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	think	more	 care 	 fully 	 	about	the	computer	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	moment	where	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	about	,	so	,	you	have	a	computer	program	,	it	 respond 	 s 	 	to	motion	--	x	and	y	--	and	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	each	computer	program	 ha 	 s 	 	all	these	 image 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	the	program	.
so	,	if	you	can	see	here	,	you	know	,	that	program	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	in	the	corner	,	if	you	spread	it	out	,	it	's	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	all	at	once	.
it	's	real	 simul 	 tane 	 ity 	 	.	it	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	we	're	used	to	 work 	 ing 	 	with	.
we	're	so	used	to	 work 	 ing 	 	in	one	vector	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	all	at	the	same	time	.
the	computer	 live 	 s 	 	in	so	 man 	 y 	 	 dimension 	 s 	 	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	,	at	the	same	time	i	was	 frust 	 rated 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	would	go	to	all	these	art	and	design	 school 	 s 	 	 every 	 where 	 	,	and	there	 we 	 re 	 	these	,	like	,	``	the	computer	lab	,	``	you	know	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	like	,	in	the	late	1990s	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	in	basel	,	a	great	graphic	design	school	.
and	here	's	 th 	 is 	 	,	like	,	 dirt 	 y 	 	,	kind	of	,	 sh 	 odd 	 y 	 	,	kind	of	,	dark	computer	room	.
and	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	wonder	,	is	 th 	 is 	 	the	goal	?
is	 th 	 is 	 	what	we	want	,	you	know	?
and	 al 	 so 	 	,	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	be	 fascinate 	 d 	 	by	 machine 	 s 	 	--	you	know	,	like	copy	 machine 	 s 	 	--	and	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	in	basel	.
i	 notice 	 d 	 	how	we	 s 	 pent 	 	so	much	time	on	making	it	 inter 	 active 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	like	,	a	touch	screen	--	and	i	 notice 	 d 	 	how	you	can	 on 	 ly 	 	touch	five	 place 	 s 	 	,	and	so	,	``	why	are	we	 was 	 ting 	 	so	much	 inter 	 activity 	 	 every 	 where 	 	?	``
 be 	 came 	 	a	question	.	and	 al 	 so 	 	,	the	sound	:	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	i	can	make	my	thinkpad	pretend	it	's	a	 tele 	 phone 	 	.
you	get	it	?	no	?	o.k	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	,	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	in	logan	 air 	 port 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	,	like	,	 call 	 ing 	 	out	to	me	.
do	you	hear	that	?	it	's	like	 cow 	 s 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	at	4	 a.m 	 . 	 	at	logan	.
so	,	i	was	 wonder 	 ing 	 	,	like	,	what	is	 th 	 is 	 	thing	in	front	of	me	,	 th 	 is 	 	computer	thing	?
it	did	n't	make	any	sense	.
so	,	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	make	 thing 	 s 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 object 	 s 	 	made	of	old	 computer 	 s 	 	from	my	 base 	 ment 	 	.
i	made	--	i	took	my	old	macintoshes	and	made	different	 object 	 s 	 	out	of	them	from	tokyo	.
i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 dis 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 computer 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	so	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	make	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	out	of	palmpilots	.
i	made	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 work 	 s 	 	.
they	're	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	i	made	and	put	a	palmpilot	in	the	middle	 a 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	 dis 	 play 	 	that	's	sort	of	 think 	 ing 	 	,	i	'm	abstract	art	.	what	am	i	?	i	'm	abstract	.
and	so	it	 keep 	 s 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	out	loud	of	 it 	 s 	 	own	 abstract 	 ion 	 	.
i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	be	 fascinate 	 d 	 	by	plastic	,	so	i	 s 	 pent 	 	four	 month 	 s 	 	making	eight	plastic	 block 	 s 	 	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 optical 	 ly 	 	 trans 	 parent 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	 re 	 lease 	 	of	stress	.
 be 	 cause 	 	of	that	,	i	 be 	 came 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	blue	tape	,	so	in	san	francisco	,	at	c.c	.	,	i	had	a	whole	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	on	blue	tape	.
i	made	a	whole	 install 	 ation 	 	out	of	blue	tape	--	blue	 paint 	 ers 	 	'	tape	.
and	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	my	wife	kind	of	got	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	me	,	so	i	 stop 	 ped 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	blue	tape	and	 beg 	 an 	 	to	think	,	well	,	what	else	is	there	in	life	?
and	so	 computer 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	know	,	these	big	 computer 	 s 	 	,	there	are	now	 tin 	 y 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	.
they	're	 little 	 r 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	,	so	the	one	-	chip	 computer 	 s 	 	,	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	program	one	-	chip	 computer 	 s 	 	and	make	 object 	 s 	 	out	of	p.c	.	 board 	 s 	 	,	leds	.
i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	make	led	 sculpt 	 ures 	 	that	would	live	 in 	 side 	 	little	boxes	out	of	mdf	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	light	boxes	i	made	for	a	show	in	italy	.
 ver 	 y 	 	simple	boxes	:	you	just	press	one	button	and	some	led	 interact 	 ion 	 	 occur 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 lamp 	 s 	 	i	made	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 bent 	 o 	 	box	lamp	:	it	's	sort	of	a	plastic	rice	lamp	;	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	friendly	.
i	did	a	show	in	london	last	year	made	out	of	ipods	--	i	used	ipods	 a 	 s 	 	a	material	.
so	i	took	16	ipod	nanos	and	made	a	kind	of	a	nano	fish	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	.
 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	for	reebok	.
i	've	 d 	 one 	 	 shoe 	 s 	 	for	reebok	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	a	hobby	for	 appar 	 el 	 	.
so	 any 	 ways 	 	,	there	are	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	you	can	do	,	but	the	thing	i	love	the	most	is	to	experience	,	taste	the	world	.
the	world	is	just	so	tasty	.
we	think	we	'll	go	to	a	museum	;	that	's	where	all	the	 taste 	 s 	 	are	.
no	,	they	're	all	out	there	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	like	,	in	front	of	the	eiffel	tower	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	around	the	louvre	area	.
 th 	 is 	 	i	found	,	where	nature	had	made	a	picture	for	me	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	perfect	90	-	degree	angle	by	nature	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	strange	moment	where	,	like	,	these	 thing 	 s 	 	kind	of	 appear 	 ed 	 	.
we	all	are	creative	people	.
we	have	 th 	 is 	 	gene	defect	in	our	mind	.
we	ca	n't	help	but	stop	,	right	?	 th 	 is 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	's	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	thing	.
it	's	the	 fore 	 ver 	 	-	 al 	 ways 	 	-	on	museum	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	from	the	cape	last	year	.
i	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	i	had	to	find	the	 equ 	 ation 	 	of	art	and	design	,	which	we	know	 a 	 s 	 	circle	-	triangle	-	square	.
it	's	 every 	 where 	 	on	the	beach	,	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	.
i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	collect	every	 in 	 stance 	 	of	circle	-	triangle	-	square	.
i	put	these	all	back	,	by	the	way	.	and	i	 al 	 so 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	how	.	some	 rock 	 s 	 	are	 t 	 win 	 s 	 	 separat 	 ed 	 	at	birth	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	out	there	,	you	know	.
i	'm	,	like	,	how	did	 th 	 is 	 	happen	,	kind	of	thing	?
i	 br 	 ought 	 	you	 guy 	 s 	 	together	 aga 	 in 	 	.
so	,	three	 year 	 s 	 	ago	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	,	the	 letter 	 s 	 	m	-	i	-	t	 occur 	 ring 	 	in	 simpl 	 icity 	 	and	 complex 	 ity 	 	.
my	 al 	 ma 	 	 mat 	 er 	 	,	mit	,	and	i	had	 th 	 is 	 	moment	--	a	kind	of	m.	night	shayamalan	moment	--	where	i	thought	,	 who 	 a 	 	!	i	have	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	i	went	after	it	with	 pass 	 ion 	 	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	risd	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	kind	of	 a 	 rose 	 	--	going	to	risd	--	and	i	could	n't	reconcile	 th 	 is 	 	real	easy	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 letter 	 s 	 	had	told	me	,	mit	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
but	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	in	the	french	word	 ra 	 ison 	 	d'être	.
i	was	,	like	,	aha	,	wait	a	second	.
and	there	risd	 appear 	 ed 	 	.
and	so	i	 real 	 ized 	 	it	was	o.k	.	to	go	.
so	,	i	'm	going	to	risd	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
who	's	a	risd	 al 	 um 	 	out	there	?
risd	 al 	 um 	 s 	 	?	 yea 	 h 	 	,	risd	.	there	we	go	,	risd	.	 wo 	 o 	 	,	risd	.
i	'm	sorry	,	i	'm	sorry	,	art	center	--	art	center	is	good	,	too	.
risd	is	kind	of	my	new	kind	of	 pass 	 ion 	 	,	and	i	'll	tell	you	a	little	bit	about	that	.
so	,	risd	is	--	i	was	 out 	 side 	 	risd	,	and	some	student	wrote	 th 	 is 	 	on	some	block	,	and	i	thought	,	 w 	 ow 	 	,	risd	 want 	 s 	 	to	know	what	 it 	 self 	 	is	.
and	i	have	no	idea	what	risd	should	be	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	or	what	it	 want 	 s 	 	to	be	,	but	one	thing	i	have	to	tell	you	is	that	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	i	'm	a	 techno 	 logist 	 	,	i	do	n't	like	technology	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
it	's	a	,	kind	of	,	the	qi	thing	,	or	 what 	 ever 	 	.
people	say	,	are	you	going	to	 br 	 ing 	 	risd	 in 	 to 	 	the	future	?
and	i	say	,	well	,	i	'm	going	to	 br 	 ing 	 	the	future	back	to	risd	.
there	's	my	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	.	 be 	 cause 	 	in	 re 	 ality 	 	,	the	problem	is	n't	how	to	make	the	world	more	 techno 	 logical 	 	.
it	's	about	how	to	make	it	more	 human 	 e 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	if	 any 	 thing 	 	,	i	think	risd	 ha 	 s 	 	a	strange	dna	.
it	's	a	strange	 ex 	 uber 	 ance 	 	about	 material 	 s 	 	,	about	the	world	:	a	 fasci 	 nation 	 	that	i	think	the	world	 need 	 s 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	right	now	.
so	,	thank	you	 every 	 one 	 	.
