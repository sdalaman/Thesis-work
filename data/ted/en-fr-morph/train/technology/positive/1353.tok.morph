i	'm	here	to	share	my	 photograph 	 y 	 	.
or	is	it	 photograph 	 y 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	,	of	course	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	photograph	that	you	ca	n't	take	with	your	camera	.
yet	,	my	interest	in	 photograph 	 y 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	i	got	my	first	digital	camera	at	the	age	of	15	.
it	 mix 	 ed 	 	with	my	 ear 	 lier 	 	 pass 	 ion 	 	for	 draw 	 ing 	 	,	but	it	was	a	bit	different	,	 be 	 cause 	 	using	the	camera	,	the	process	was	in	the	 plan 	 ning 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	.
and	when	you	take	a	photograph	with	a	camera	,	the	process	 end 	 s 	 	when	you	press	the	trigger	.
so	to	me	it	felt	like	 photograph 	 y 	 	was	more	about	 be 	 ing 	 	at	the	right	place	and	the	right	time	.
i	felt	like	 any 	 one 	 	could	do	that	.
so	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	create	 some 	 thing 	 	different	,	 some 	 thing 	 	where	the	process	 start 	 s 	 	when	you	press	the	trigger	.
 photo 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	:	construction	going	on	 a 	 long 	 	a	 bus 	 y 	 	road	.
but	it	 ha 	 s 	 	an	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	twist	.
and	 de 	 spite 	 	that	,	it	 retain 	 s 	 	a	level	of	 real 	 ism 	 	.
or	 photo 	 s 	 	like	these	--	both	dark	and	 color 	 ful 	 	,	but	all	with	a	common	goal	of	 retain 	 ing 	 	the	level	of	 real 	 ism 	 	.
when	i	say	 real 	 ism 	 	,	i	mean	photo	-	 real 	 ism 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	of	course	,	it	's	not	 some 	 thing 	 	you	can	capture	 re 	 ally 	 	,	but	i	 al 	 ways 	 	want	it	to	look	like	it	could	have	 be 	 en 	 	 capture 	 d 	 	 some 	 how 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	photograph	.
 photo 	 s 	 	where	you	will	need	a	brief	moment	to	think	to	figure	out	the	trick	.
so	it	's	more	about	 cap 	 tur 	 ing 	 	an	idea	than	about	 cap 	 tur 	 ing 	 	a	moment	 re 	 ally 	 	.
but	what	's	the	trick	that	 make 	 s 	 	it	look	realistic	?
is	it	 some 	 thing 	 	about	the	 detail 	 s 	 	or	the	 color 	 s 	 	?
is	it	 some 	 thing 	 	about	the	light	?
what	 create 	 s 	 	the	illusion	?
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	the	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	is	the	illusion	.
but	in	the	end	,	it	 come 	 s 	 	down	to	how	we	interpret	the	world	and	how	it	can	be	 real 	 ized 	 	on	a	two	-	dimensional	surface	.
it	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	what	is	realistic	,	it	's	what	we	think	 look 	 s 	 	realistic	 re 	 ally 	 	.
so	i	think	the	 bas 	 ic 	 s 	 	are	 quit 	 e 	 	simple	.
i	just	see	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	 puzzl 	 e 	 	of	 re 	 ality 	 	where	you	can	take	different	 piece 	 s 	 	of	 re 	 ality 	 	and	put	it	together	to	create	alternate	 re 	 ality 	 	.
and	let	me	show	you	a	simple	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
here	we	have	three	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 imagin 	 able 	 	physical	 object 	 s 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	we	all	can	 re 	 late 	 	to	living	in	a	three	-	dimensional	world	.
but	 combine 	 d 	 	in	a	certain	way	,	they	can	create	 some 	 thing 	 	that	still	 look 	 s 	 	three	-	dimensional	,	like	it	could	exist	.
but	at	the	same	time	,	we	know	it	ca	n't	.
so	we	trick	our	 brain 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	our	brain	 simpl 	 y 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	accept	the	fact	that	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	make	sense	.
and	i	see	the	same	process	with	 comb 	 in 	 ing 	 	 photograph 	 s 	 	.
it	's	just	 re 	 ally 	 	about	 comb 	 in 	 ing 	 	different	 real 	 ities 	 	.
so	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	make	a	photograph	look	realistic	,	i	think	it	's	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	do	n't	even	think	about	,	the	 thing 	 s 	 	all	around	us	in	our	 dai 	 ly 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
but	when	 comb 	 in 	 ing 	 	 photograph 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	consider	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 other 	 wise 	 	it	just	 look 	 s 	 	wrong	 some 	 how 	 	.
so	i	would	like	to	say	that	there	are	three	simple	 rule 	 s 	 	to	follow	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	a	realistic	result	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	these	 image 	 s 	 	are	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	special	.
but	 combine 	 d 	 	,	they	can	create	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	the	first	rule	is	that	 photo 	 s 	 	 combine 	 d 	 	should	have	the	same	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	.
 second 	 ly 	 	,	 photo 	 s 	 	 combine 	 d 	 	should	have	the	same	type	of	light	.
and	these	two	 image 	 s 	 	both	fulfill	these	two	 requir 	 ement 	 s 	 	--	shot	at	the	same	height	and	in	the	same	type	of	light	.
the	third	one	is	about	making	it	 im 	 possible 	 	to	distinguish	where	the	different	 image 	 s 	 	begin	and	end	by	making	it	 seam 	 less 	 	.
make	it	 im 	 possible 	 	to	say	how	the	image	 actual 	 ly 	 	was	 compose 	 d 	 	.
so	by	 match 	 ing 	 	color	,	contrast	and	 bright 	 ness 	 	in	the	 border 	 s 	 	between	the	different	 image 	 s 	 	,	 add 	 ing 	 	 photograph 	 ic 	 	 defect 	 s 	 	like	depth	of	field	,	_UNK_	 color 	 s 	 	and	noise	,	we	 er 	 ase 	 	the	 border 	 s 	 	between	the	different	 image 	 s 	 	and	make	it	look	like	one	single	image	,	 de 	 spite 	 	the	fact	that	one	image	can	contain	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 layer 	 s 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	.
so	here	's	 an 	 other 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
one	might	think	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	an	image	of	a	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	and	the	lower	part	is	what	's	 manipul 	 ated 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	image	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 entire 	 ly 	 	 compose 	 d 	 	of	 photograph 	 s 	 	from	different	 location 	 s 	 	.
i	 personal 	 ly 	 	think	that	it	's	 eas 	 ier 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	create	a	place	than	to	find	a	place	,	 be 	 cause 	 	then	you	do	n't	need	to	 com 	 promise 	 	with	the	 idea 	 s 	 	in	your	head	.
but	it	 do 	 es 	 	 requir 	 e 	 	a	lot	of	 plan 	 ning 	 	.
and	 get 	 ting 	 	 th 	 is 	 	idea	 dur 	 ing 	 	winter	,	i	 k 	 new 	 	that	i	had	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 month 	 s 	 	to	plan	it	,	to	find	the	different	 location 	 s 	 	for	the	 piece 	 s 	 	of	the	 puzzl 	 e 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	.
so	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	the	fish	was	 capture 	 d 	 	on	a	 fish 	 ing 	 	trip	.
the	 shore 	 s 	 	are	from	a	different	location	.
the	 under 	 water 	 	part	was	 capture 	 d 	 	in	a	stone	pit	.
and	 yea 	 h 	 	,	i	even	 turn 	 ed 	 	the	house	on	top	of	the	 is 	 land 	 	red	to	make	it	look	more	swedish	.
so	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	a	realistic	result	,	i	think	it	 come 	 s 	 	down	to	 plan 	 ning 	 	.
it	 al 	 ways 	 	 start 	 s 	 	with	a	sketch	,	an	idea	.
then	it	's	about	 comb 	 in 	 ing 	 	the	different	 photograph 	 s 	 	.
and	here	every	piece	is	 ver 	 y 	 	well	 plan 	 ned 	 	.
and	if	you	do	a	good	job	 cap 	 tur 	 ing 	 	the	 photo 	 s 	 	,	the	result	can	be	 quit 	 e 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	realistic	.
so	all	the	 tool 	 s 	 	are	out	there	,	and	the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	that	 limit 	 s 	 	us	is	our	 imagin 	 ation 	 	.
thank	you	.
