i	've	 al 	 ways 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	a	 cy 	 borg 	 	.
one	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 show 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	kid	was	``	the	six	million	dollar	man	,	``
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	little	bit	 close 	 r 	 	to	the	240	dollar	man	or	so	,	but	--	at	at	any	rate	.	i	would	 normal 	 ly 	 	feel	 ver 	 y 	 	self	-	conscious	and	 geek 	 y 	 	 wear 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	around	,	but	a	few	 day 	 s 	 	ago	i	saw	one	world	-	 ren 	 owned 	 	 statistic 	 ian 	 	 swallow 	 ing 	 	 s 	 word 	 s 	 	on	stage	here	,	so	i	figure	it	's	ok	 among 	 st 	 	 th 	 is 	 	group	.
but	that	's	not	what	i	want	to	talk	about	 to 	 day 	 	.
i	want	to	talk	about	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	,	and	the	power	that	i	see	inherent	in	them	.
when	i	was	a	kid	,	i	 attend 	 ed 	 	montessori	school
up	to	sixth	grade	in	atlanta	,	georgia	.
and	at	the	time	i	did	n't	think	much	about	it	,	but	then	 lat 	 er 	 	,	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	that	was	the	high	point	of	my	education	.
from	that	point	on	,	 every 	 thing 	 	else	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 down 	 hill 	 	.
and	it	was	n't	 un 	 til 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 start 	 ed 	 	making	 game 	 s 	 	,	that	--	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	think	of	them	more	 a 	 s 	 	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	.
people	call	me	a	game	 design 	 er 	 	,	but	i	 re 	 ally 	 	think	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	more	 a 	 s 	 	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	.
but	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	maria	montessori	and	her	 method 	 s 	 	,	and	the	way	she	went	about	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	the	way	she	thought	it	 ver 	 y 	 	 valu 	 able 	 	for	 kid 	 s 	 	to	kind	of	discover	 thing 	 s 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 be 	 ing 	 	taught	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 over 	 t 	 ly 	 	.
and	she	would	design	these	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	,	where	 kid 	 s 	 	in	 play 	 ing 	 	with	the	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	would	 actual 	 ly 	 	come	to	understand	these	deep	 principle 	 s 	 	of	life	and	nature	through	play	.
and	since	they	 discover 	 ed 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 tuck 	 	with	them	so	much	more	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	they	would	experience	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 failure 	 s 	 	;	there	was	a	failure	-	based	 a 	 spect 	 	to	 learn 	 ing 	 	there	.	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
and	so	,	the	 game 	 s 	 	that	i	do	,	i	think	of	 re 	 ally 	 	more	 a 	 s 	 	modern	montessori	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	.	and	i	 re 	 ally 	 	kind	of	want	them	to	be	 present 	 ed 	 	in	a	way	to	where	 kid 	 s 	 	can	kind	of	explore	and	discover	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 principle 	 s 	 	.
so	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	seti	program	.	and	that	's	the	way	i	work	.	i	get	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 subject 	 s 	 	,	i	 d 	 ive 	 	in	,	i	research	them	,	and	then	i	try	to	figure	out	how	to	craft	a	 to 	 y 	 	around	that	,	so	that	other	people	can	kind	of	experience	the	same	sense	of	 discover 	 y 	 	 a 	 s 	 	i	did	 a 	 s 	 	i	was	 learn 	 ing 	 	that	subject	.
and	it	kind	of	led	me	to	 astro 	 biology 	 	,	which	is	the	 stud 	 y 	 	of	possible	life	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
and	then	drake	's	 equ 	 ation 	 	,	which	is	looking	at	the	 prob 	 ability 	 	of	life	 ari 	 s 	 ing 	 	on	 planet 	 s 	 	,	how	long	it	might	last	,	how	 man 	 y 	 	 planet 	 s 	 	are	out	there	,	stuff	like	that	.
and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	looking	at	how	 interest 	 ing 	 	drake	's	 equ 	 ation 	 	was	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 span 	 ned 	 	all	these	different	 subject 	 s 	 	--	physics	,	 chemist 	 ry 	 	,	 socio 	 logy 	 	,	 economic 	 s 	 	,	 astro 	 nomy 	 	.
and	 an 	 other 	 	thing	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 impress 	 ed 	 	me	a	long	time	ago	was	``	 power 	 s 	 	of	ten	,	``	charles	and	ray	eames	'	film	.
and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 put 	 ting 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	two	together	and	 wonder 	 ing 	 	,	could	i	build	a	 to 	 y 	 	where	 kid 	 s 	 	would	kind	of	trip	 a 	 cross 	 	all	these	 interest 	 ing 	 	 principle 	 s 	 	of	life	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 exist 	 s 	 	and	 a 	 s 	 	it	might	go	in	the	future	.
 thing 	 s 	 	where	you	might	trip	 a 	 cross 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	the	copernican	principle	,	the	fermi	paradox	,	the	 anthro 	 pic 	 	principle	,	the	origin	of	life	.
and	so	i	'm	going	to	show	you	a	 to 	 y 	 	 to 	 day 	 	that	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	,	that	i	think	of	more	than	 any 	 thing 	 	else	 a 	 s 	 	kind	of	a	 philosoph 	 y 	 	 to 	 y 	 	.
in	 play 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 to 	 y 	 	,	you	kind	of	--	 th 	 is 	 	will	 br 	 ing 	 	up	 philosoph 	 ical 	 	 question 	 s 	 	in	you	.
 th 	 is 	 	game	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	spore	.	``	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	it	for	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 year 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 get 	 ting 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	close	to	 finish 	 ed 	 	now	.
it	 occur 	 s 	 	at	all	these	different	 scale 	 s 	 	,	first	of	all	,	from	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	small	to	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	large	.
i	'm	just	going	to	pop	in	at	the	start	of	the	game	.	and	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	start	 th 	 is 	 	game	in	a	drop	of	water	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	small	single	-	cell	creature	,	and	right	off	the	bat	you	 bas 	 ically 	 	just	have	to	live	,	 surviv 	 e 	 	,	 re 	 produce 	 	.
so	here	we	are	,	at	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 micro 	 scopic 	 	scale	,	 swimm 	 ing 	 	around	.	and	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	 real 	 ize 	 	that	 cell 	 s 	 	do	n't	have	 eye 	 s 	 	,	but	it	 help 	 s 	 	to	make	it	cute	.
the	 player 	 s 	 	are	going	to	play	through	every	generation	of	 th 	 is 	 	species	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	you	play	the	game	the	creature	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	growing	bit	by	bit	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	we	start	growing	the	camera	will	 actual 	 ly 	 	start	 zoom 	 ing 	 	out	,	and	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	see	in	the	 back 	 ground 	 	there	will	 actual 	 ly 	 	start	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	 pull 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 fore 	 ground 	 	,	 show 	 ing 	 	you	a	little	bit	of	what	you	'll	be	 interact 	 ing 	 	with	 a 	 s 	 	you	grow	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	we	eat	,	the	camera	 start 	 s 	 	 pull 	 ing 	 	out	,	and	then	we	start	 interact 	 ing 	 	with	kind	of	 large 	 r 	 	and	 large 	 r 	 	 organism 	 s 	 	.
now	,	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	play	through	 man 	 y 	 	 generation 	 s 	 	here	,	at	the	cellular	scale	.
i	'm	going	to	skip	 a 	 head 	 	here	.	at	some	point	we	get	 large 	 r 	 	,	and	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	to	a	macro	-	evolution	scale	.
now	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	we	're	 leav 	 ing 	 	the	water	,	and	one	thing	that	's	kind	of	 import 	 ant 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	game	is	that	,	at	every	level	,	the	player	is	 design 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	creature	,	and	that	's	a	fundamental	 a 	 spect 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
now	,	in	the	evolution	game	here	,	the	creature	scale	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	you	have	to	eat	,	 surviv 	 e 	 	,	and	then	 re 	 produce 	 	.	you	know	,	 ver 	 y 	 	darwinian	.
one	thing	we	 notice 	 d 	 	with	``	the	sims	,	``	which	is	a	game	i	did	 ear 	 lier 	 	,	is	that	 player 	 s 	 	love	making	stuff	.
when	they	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	make	stuff	in	the	game	they	had	a	tremendous	amount	of	 empath 	 y 	 	in	 connect 	 ion 	 	to	it	.	even	if	it	was	n't	 a 	 s 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	 a 	 s 	 	what	other	people	would	make	it	--	 a 	 s 	 	a	professional	artist	would	make	for	 game 	 s 	 	--	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 tuck 	 	with	them	and	they	 re 	 ally 	 	 car 	 ed 	 	about	what	would	happen	to	it	.
so	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	we	've	left	the	water	,	and	now	with	 th 	 is 	 	little	creature	--	we	could	 br 	 ing 	 	up	the	volume	a	little	bit	--	and	now	we	might	try	to	eat	.	we	might	sneak	up	on	 th 	 is 	 	little	guy	over	here	 may 	 be 	 	,	and	try	and	eat	him	.
ok	,	well	,	we	fight	.
ok	,	we	got	him	.	now	we	get	a	meal	.
so	 re 	 ally 	 	,	at	 th 	 is 	 	part	of	the	game	,	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	is	we	're	running	around	and	 surviv 	 ing 	 	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	to	the	next	generation	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	going	to	play	through	every	generation	of	 th 	 is 	 	creature	.
we	can	mate	,	so	i	'm	going	to	see	if	one	of	these	 creature 	 s 	 	 want 	 s 	 	to	mate	with	me	.	 yea 	 h 	 	.
we	did	n't	want	to	 re 	 play 	 	actual	evolution	with	 human 	 s 	 	and	all	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 al 	 most 	 	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	look	at	alternate	 possibil 	 ities 	 	in	evolution	.
evolution	is	 usual 	 ly 	 	 present 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	one	path	that	we	took	through	,	but	 re 	 ally 	 	it	 represent 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	huge	set	of	 possibil 	 ities 	 	.
now	once	we	mate	,	we	click	on	the	egg	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	the	game	 start 	 s 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	 re 	 ally 	 	focused	on	here	was	giving	the	 player 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	high	-	leverage	 tool 	 s 	 	,	so	that	for	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	amount	of	effort	the	player	can	make	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	cool	.	and	it	 involve 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	 intellig 	 ence 	 	on	the	tool	side	.
but	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	editor	where	we	're	going	to	design	the	next	generation	of	our	creature	.	so	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	little	 s 	 pine 	 	.	i	can	move	around	here	.	i	can	extend	.
i	can	 al 	 so 	 	 infla 	 te 	 	or	 defl 	 ate 	 	it	with	the	mouse	wheel	,	so	you	sculpt	it	like	clay	.	we	have	 part 	 s 	 	here	that	i	can	put	on	or	pull	off	.
the	idea	is	that	the	player	can	 bas 	 ically 	 	design	 any 	 thing 	 	they	can	think	of	in	 th 	 is 	 	editor	,	and	we	'll	 bas 	 ically 	 	 br 	 ing 	 	it	to	life	.
so	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	i	might	put	some	 limb 	 s 	 	on	the	character	here	.
i	'll	 infla 	 te 	 	them	kind	of	large	.
and	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	i	might	decide	i	'm	going	to	put	--	i	'll	put	 mouth 	 s 	 	on	the	 limb 	 s 	 	.
so	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 player 	 s 	 	are	 encourag 	 ed 	 	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	creative	in	the	game	.
here	,	i	'll	give	it	one	eye	in	the	middle	,	 may 	 be 	 	scale	it	up	a	bit	.	point	it	down	.
and	i	'll	 al 	 so 	 	give	it	a	few	 leg 	 s 	 	.
so	in	some	sense	we	want	 th 	 is 	 	to	feel	like	an	 ampl 	 ifier 	 	for	the	player	's	 imagin 	 ation 	 	,	so	that	with	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	number	of	 click 	 s 	 	a	player	can	create	 some 	 thing 	 	that	they	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	think	was	possible	before	.
you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 al 	 most 	 	like	 design 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	maya	that	an	eight	-	year	-	old	can	use	.
but	 re 	 ally 	 	the	goal	here	was	,	 with 	 in 	 	about	a	minute	,	i	 want 	 ed 	 	 some 	 body 	 	to	replicate	what	 typical 	 ly 	 	 take 	 s 	 	a	 pict 	 orial 	 	artist	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 week 	 s 	 	to	create	.
ok	,	now	i	'll	put	some	 hand 	 s 	 	on	it	.
ok	,	so	here	i	've	 bas 	 ically 	 	 throw 	 n 	 	together	a	little	creature	.
let	me	give	it	a	little	weapon	on	the	tail	here	,	so	it	can	fight	.
ok	,	so	that	's	the	complete	model	.	now	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	go	to	the	 paint 	 ing 	 	phase	.
now	,	at	 th 	 is 	 	phase	,	the	program	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	some	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	the	 top 	 ology 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	creature	.	it	kind	of	 know 	 s 	 	where	the	 back 	 bone 	 	is	,	where	the	 s 	 pine 	 	,	the	 limb 	 s 	 	are	.
it	kind	of	 know 	 s 	 	how	 strip 	 es 	 	should	run	,	how	it	should	be	 s 	 had 	 ed 	 	.	and	so	we	're	 pro 	 ce 	 dur 	 ally 	 	generating	the	 text 	 ure 	 	map	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	a	 text 	 ure 	 	artist	would	take	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 day 	 s 	 	to	work	on	.
and	then	we	can	test	it	out	,	once	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	that	,	and	see	how	it	would	move	around	.
and	so	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	the	computer	is	 pro 	 ce 	 dur 	 ally 	 	 anim 	 ating 	 	 th 	 is 	 	creature	.
it	's	looking	at	 what 	 ever 	 	i	've	designed	.	it	will	 actual 	 ly 	 	 br 	 ing 	 	it	to	life	.
and	i	can	see	how	it	might	dance	.
how	it	might	show	 emotion 	 s 	 	,	how	it	might	fight	.
so	it	's	 act 	 ing 	 	with	 it 	 s 	 	two	 mouth 	 s 	 	there	.
i	can	even	have	it	pose	for	a	photo	.	snap	a	little	photo	of	it	.
so	at	any	rate	,	then	i	 br 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	game	.	it	's	born	,
and	i	play	the	next	generation	of	my	creature	through	evolution	.
now	 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	 empath 	 y 	 	that	the	 player 	 s 	 	have	when	they	create	the	content	is	tremendous	.	now	,	when	 player 	 s 	 	create	content	in	 th 	 is 	 	game	,	it	's	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	 s 	 ent 	 	up	to	a	 serv 	 er 	 	and	then	 re 	 distribut 	 ed 	 	to	all	the	other	 player 	 s 	 	 trans 	 parent 	 ly 	 	.
so	in	fact	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	'm	 interact 	 ing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	world	with	other	 creature 	 s 	 	,	these	 creature 	 s 	 	are	 trans 	 parent 	 ly 	 	coming	from	other	 player 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	play	.
so	the	process	of	 play 	 ing 	 	the	game	is	a	process	of	building	up	 th 	 is 	 	huge	 data 	 base 	 	of	content	.	and	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 every 	 thing 	 	you	're	going	to	see	in	 th 	 is 	 	game	,	there	's	an	editor	for	in	the	game	that	the	player	can	create	,	all	the	way	up	through	 civil 	 ization 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	baby	.
when	i	eat	,	i	'll	 actual 	 ly 	 	start	growing	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	next	generation	.
but	i	'm	going	to	skip	way	 a 	 head 	 	here	.	now	,	 normal 	 ly 	 	what	would	happen	is	these	 creature 	 s 	 	would	work	 the 	 ir 	 	way	up	,	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 come 	 	intelligent	.
i	'd	start	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	 tribe 	 s 	 	,	cities	and	 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	of	them	over	time	.
i	'm	going	to	skip	way	 a 	 head 	 	here	to	the	space	phase	.
 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	they	would	go	out	 in 	 to 	 	space	,	and	start	 colon 	 izing 	 	and	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
now	 re 	 ally 	 	,	in	some	sense	,	i	want	the	 player 	 s 	 	to	be	building	 th 	 is 	 	world	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 imagin 	 ation 	 	,	and	then	 ex 	 tract 	 ing 	 	it	from	them	with	the	 l 	 east 	 	amount	of	pain	.
so	that	's	kind	of	what	these	 tool 	 s 	 	are	about	,	are	:	how	do	we	make	the	game	play	the	player	's	 imagin 	 ation 	 	-	 ampl 	 ifier 	 	?
and	how	do	we	make	these	 tool 	 s 	 	,	these	 editor 	 s 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	are	just	 a 	 s 	 	 f 	 un 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	game	 it 	 self 	 	?
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	planet	that	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	on	up	to	 th 	 is 	 	point	in	the	game	.
so	far	the	entire	game	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 play 	 ed 	 	on	the	surface	of	 th 	 is 	 	little	world	here	.
now	,	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	a	 ver 	 y 	 	little	 to 	 y 	 	planet	.	 al 	 most 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	like	the	montessori	 to 	 y 	 	idea	.
you	know	,	what	 happen 	 s 	 	if	you	give	 some 	 body 	 	a	 to 	 y 	 	planet	,	and	let	them	play	with	a	lot	of	 dynamic 	 s 	 	on	it	,
what	could	they	discover	?	what	might	they	learn	on	 th 	 is 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	world	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 extra 	 cted 	 	from	the	player	's	 imagin 	 ation 	 	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	planet	that	the	player	 evolv 	 ed 	 	on	.	 thing 	 s 	 	like	the	 building 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 vehicle 	 s 	 	,	the	 architect 	 ure 	 	,	 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	all	designed	by	the	player	up	to	 th 	 is 	 	point	.
so	here	's	a	little	city	with	some	of	our	 guy 	 s 	 	kind	of	 walk 	 ing 	 	around	in	it	.
and	most	 game 	 s 	 	kind	of	put	the	player	in	the	role	of	luke	skywalker	,	 th 	 is 	 	protagonist	 play 	 ing 	 	through	 th 	 is 	 	story	.
 re 	 ally 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	more	about	 put 	 ting 	 	the	player	in	the	role	of	george	lucas	,	you	know	?	i	want	them	,	after	they	've	 play 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	game	,	to	have	 extra 	 cted 	 	an	entire	world	that	they	're	now	 interact 	 ing 	 	with	.
now	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	pull	down	here	,	we	still	have	a	whole	set	of	 creature 	 s 	 	living	on	the	surface	of	the	planet	.	there	are	all	these	different	 dynamic 	 s 	 	going	on	here	.
in	fact	,	i	can	look	over	here	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	kind	of	a	little	 simpl 	 ified 	 	food	web	that	's	going	on	with	the	 creature 	 s 	 	.
i	can	open	 th 	 is 	 	up	and	then	 s 	 can 	 	what	 exist 	 s 	 	on	the	surface	,	and	get	some	sense	of	the	 divers 	 ity 	 	of	 creature 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	in	.
some	of	these	 we 	 re 	 	 create 	 d 	 	by	the	player	,	 other 	 s 	 	by	other	 player 	 s 	 	and	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	 s 	 ent 	 	over	here	.
but	there	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	little	kind	of	 calcul 	 ation 	 	of	what	's	 requir 	 ed 	 	,
how	much	 plant 	 s 	 	are	 requir 	 ed 	 	for	the	 herb 	 ivores 	 	to	live	,
how	 man 	 y 	 	 herb 	 ivores 	 	for	the	 carnivore 	 s 	 	to	eat	,	etc	.	,	that	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	to	balance	 active 	 ly 	 	.
now	 al 	 so 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	phase	,	we	're	 get 	 ting 	 	more	and	more	god	-	like	 power 	 s 	 	for	the	player	,	and	you	can	kind	of	experiment	with	 th 	 is 	 	planet	 aga 	 in 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 to 	 y 	 	.
so	i	can	come	in	and	i	can	do	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	just	treat	 th 	 is 	 	planet	 a 	 s 	 	a	lump	of	clay	.
we	have	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	little	weather	 system 	 s 	 	you	see	here	,	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 geo 	 logy 	 	.	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	i	could	open	one	of	my	 tool 	 s 	 	here	and	then	carve	out	 river 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	whole	thing	is	kind	of	like	a	big	lump	of	clay	,	a	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	.
i	can	 al 	 so 	 	play	with	the	 dynamic 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	world	over	time	.
so	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	i	can	do	is	start	 pump 	 ing 	 	more	co	2	 gas 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	atmosphere	,	and	so	that	's	what	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	here	.
there	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	little	read	out	down	there	of	our	planetary	atmosphere	,	pressure	and	temperature	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	i	start	 pump 	 ing 	 	in	more	atmosphere	,	we	're	going	to	start	 push 	 ing 	 	up	the	 green 	 house 	 	 gas 	 es 	 	here	and	if	you	'll	start	 not 	 ic 	 ing 	 	,	we	start	 see 	 ing 	 	the	ocean	 level 	 s 	 	rise	over	time	.
and	our	cities	are	going	to	be	at	risk	too	,	 be 	 cause 	 	a	lot	of	these	are	 coast 	 al 	 	cities	.
you	can	see	the	ocean	 level 	 s 	 	are	 ris 	 ing 	 	now	and	 a 	 s 	 	they	encroach	 up 	 on 	 	the	cities	,	i	'll	start	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	cities	here	.
so	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	i	want	the	 player 	 s 	 	to	be	able	to	experiment	and	explore	a	huge	amount	of	failure	space	.	so	there	 go 	 es 	 	one	city	.
now	over	time	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	to	heat	up	the	planet	.
so	at	first	what	we	're	going	to	see	is	a	global	ocean	rise	here	on	 th 	 is 	 	little	 to 	 y 	 	planet	,
but	then	over	time	--	i	can	speed	it	up	just	a	little	bit	--	we	'll	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	the	heat	impact	of	that	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
so	not	 on 	 ly 	 	will	it	get	 hot 	 ter 	 	,	but	at	some	point	it	's	going	to	get	so	hot	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	will	 entire 	 ly 	 	 evapo 	 rate 	 	.
so	at	first	they	'll	go	up	,	and	then	they	'll	 evapo 	 rate 	 	,	and	that	'll	be	my	planet	.
so	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	what	we	're	 get 	 ting 	 	here	is	the	 s 	 equ 	 el 	 	to	``	an	 in 	 convenient 	 	truth	,	``	in	about	two	 minute 	 s 	 	,
and	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	up	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	point	about	 game 	 s 	 	.
now	here	,	our	entire	 ocean 	 s 	 	are	 evapo 	 rating 	 	off	the	surface	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	it	 keep 	 s 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 hot 	 ter 	 	at	some	point	the	entire	planet	's	going	to	melt	down	.
here	it	 go 	 es 	 	.
so	we	're	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 simul 	 ating 	 	 bio 	 logical 	 	 dynamic 	 s 	 	--	food	 web 	 s 	 	and	all	that	--	but	 al 	 so 	 	 geo 	 logic 	 	,	you	know	,	on	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	core	scale	.
and	what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	me	about	 game 	 s 	 	,	in	some	sense	,	is	that	i	think	we	can	take	a	lot	of	long	-	term	 dynamic 	 s 	 	and	compress	them	 in 	 to 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	short	-	term	kind	of	 experience 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	so	hard	for	people	to	think	50	or	100	 year 	 s 	 	out	,	but	when	you	can	give	them	a	 to 	 y 	 	,	and	they	can	experience	these	long	-	term	 dynamic 	 s 	 	in	just	a	few	 minute 	 s 	 	,	i	think	it	's	an	 entire 	 ly 	 	different	kind	of	point	of	view	,	where	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	mapping	,	using	the	game	to	re	-	map	our	 intuit 	 ion 	 	.
it	's	 al 	 most 	 	in	the	same	way	that	a	 tele 	 scope 	 	or	 micro 	 scope 	 	 re 	 calibrate 	 s 	 	your	 eye 	 sight 	 	;	i	think	computer	 simul 	 ations 	 	can	 re 	 calibrate 	 	your	instinct
 a 	 cross 	 	vast	 scale 	 s 	 	of	both	space	and	time	.
so	here	's	our	little	solar	system	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	pull	away	from	our	 melt 	 ed 	 	planet	here	.
we	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	a	couple	of	other	 planet 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	solar	system	.
let	's	fly	to	 an 	 other 	 	one	.
so	in	fact	,	we	're	going	to	have	 th 	 is 	 	 un 	 limit 	 ed 	 	number	of	 world 	 s 	 	you	can	kind	of	explore	here	.	now	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	move	 in 	 to 	 	the	future	,	and	we	start	going	out	in	 th 	 is 	 	space	and	 do 	 ing 	 	stuff	,	we	're	 draw 	 ing 	 	a	lot	from	 thing 	 s 	 	like	science	fiction	.
and	all	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	science	fiction	 movie 	 s 	 
i	want	to	 bas 	 ically 	 	play	out	here	 a 	 s 	 	different	 dynamic 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	planet	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	some	life	on	it	.
here	it	is	,	some	 indi 	 genous 	 	life	down	here	.
now	one	of	the	 tool 	 s 	 	i	can	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	earn	for	my	ufo	is	a	monolith	that	i	can	drop	down	.
now	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	these	 guy 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	to	go	up	and	bow	to	it	,	and	over	time	,	once	they	touch	it	,	they	will	 be 	 come 	 	intelligent	.
so	i	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	pick	a	species	on	a	planet	and	then	make	them	 senti 	 ent 	 	.
you	see	,	now	they	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	gone	to	 trib 	 al 	 	 dynamic 	 s 	 	.
and	now	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	one	here	,	i	can	,	if	i	want	to	,	get	out	of	the	ufo	and	walk	up	,	and	they	should	be	 worship 	 ping 	 	me	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	 a 	 s 	 	a	god	.
at	first	they	're	a	little	 freak 	 ed 	 	out	.
ok	,	well	 may 	 be 	 	they	're	not	 worship 	 ping 	 	me	.
i	think	i	'll	 leav 	 e 	 	before	they	get	 hostil 	 e 	 	.
but	we	 bas 	 ically 	 	want	a	 divers 	 ity 	 	of	 activ 	 ities 	 	the	 player 	 s 	 	can	play	through	 th 	 is 	 	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	,	i	want	to	be	able	to	play	,	``	the	day	the	earth	stood	still	,	``	``	2001	:	a	space	odyssey	,	``	``	star	trek	,	``	``	war	of	the	 world 	 s 	 	.	``
now	 a 	 s 	 	we	pull	away	from	 th 	 is 	 	world	--	we	're	going	to	keep	 pull 	 ing 	 	away	from	the	star	now	.	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 al 	 ways 	 	 frust 	 rated 	 	me	a	little	bit	about	 astro 	 nomy 	 	when	i	was	a	kid	is	how	it	was	 al 	 ways 	 	 present 	 ed 	 	so	two	-	dimensionally	and	so	static	.	 a 	 s 	 	we	pull	away	from	the	star	here	,	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	now	out	 in 	 to 	 	 inter 	 stellar 	 	space	,	and	we	're	 get 	 ting 	 	a	sense	of	the	space	around	our	home	star	.
now	what	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	is	to	present	 th 	 is 	 	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 wonder 	 fully 	 	3d	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	is	.
and	not	 on 	 ly 	 	that	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	show	the	 dynamic 	 s 	 	,	and	a	lot	of	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	 object 	 s 	 	that	you	might	find	,	 may 	 be 	 	like	in	the	hubble	,	at	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	realistic	 fr 	 equ 	 encies 	 	and	 scale 	 s 	 	.
so	most	people	have	no	idea	of	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	like	,	an	 e 	 mission 	 	 nebul 	 a 	 	and	a	planetary	 nebul 	 a 	 	.
but	these	are	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	can	kind	of	put	in	 th 	 is 	 	little	 galax 	 y 	 	here	.
so	we	're	 fly 	 ing 	 	over	here	to	what	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	black	hole	.
i	want	to	 bas 	 ically 	 	have	the	entire	zoo	of	hubble	 object 	 s 	 	that	people	can	kind	of	interact	with	and	play	with	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	.
so	here	's	a	little	black	hole	that	we	 prob 	 ably 	 	do	n't	want	to	get	too	close	to	.
but	we	 al 	 so 	 	have	 star 	 s 	 	and	 thing 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
if	we	pull	all	the	way	back	,	we	start	 see 	 ing 	 	the	entire	 galax 	 y 	 	here	,	kind	of	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	in	motion	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	thing	where	,	 typical 	 ly 	 	when	people	present	 galax 	 ies 	 	,	it	's	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	these	 ver 	 y 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 photo 	 s 	 	,
but	they	're	 al 	 ways 	 	static	.	and	when	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	 br 	 ing 	 	it	forward	in	time	and	start	 anim 	 ating 	 	it	,	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	kind	of	 amaz 	 ing 	 	,	what	a	 galax 	 y 	 	would	look	like	,	fast	 forward 	 ed 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	would	be	about	one	million	 year 	 s 	 	a	second	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	have	about	 rough 	 ly 	 	one	supernova	every	century	or	so	.
and	so	you	'd	have	 th 	 is 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 spark 	 ling 	 	thing	,	with	the	 dis 	 k 	 	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	 rot 	 ating 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 rough 	 ly 	 	what	it	would	look	like	.	and	so	 re 	 ally 	 	,
part	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	about	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	of	the	natural	world	,	to	 some 	 body 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 imagin 	 ative 	 	way	,	so	that	they	can	start	 calib 	 rating 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	instinct	 a 	 cross 	 	these	vast	 scale 	 s 	 	of	space	and	time	.
chris	was	 wonder 	 ing 	 	what	kind	of	 god 	 s 	 	that	the	 player 	 s 	 	would	 be 	 come 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	think	about	it	,	you	're	going	to	have	15	-	year	-	olds	,	20	-	year	-	olds	,	 what 	 ever 	 	,	 fly 	 ing 	 	around	 th 	 is 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	.	and	they	might	be	a	 nurtur 	 ing 	 	god	.	they	might	be	boot	-	 s 	 trapping 	 	life	on	 planet 	 s 	 	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	terra	-	form	and	spread	 civil 	 ization 	 	.
you	might	be	a	 venge 	 ful 	 	god	and	going	out	and	 con 	 quest 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	can	do	that	,	you	can	go	in	and	attack	other	intelligent	 race 	 s 	 	.
you	might	be	a	 network 	 ing 	 	god	,	building	 alliance 	 s 	 	,	which	you	can	 al 	 so 	 	do	in	the	game	,	or	just	 cur 	 ious 	 	,	going	around	and	 want 	 ing 	 	to	explore	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	you	possibly	can	.
but	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	the	reason	why	i	make	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	if	there	's	one	 differ 	 ence 	 	i	could	possibly	make	in	the	world	,	that	i	would	 choos 	 e 	 	to	make	,	it	's	that	i	would	like	to	 some 	 how 	 	give	people	just	a	little	bit	better	 calib 	 ration 	 	on	long	-	term	 think 	 ing 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	most	of	the	 problem 	 s 	 	that	our	world	is	facing	right	now	is	the	result	of	short	-	term	 think 	 ing 	 	,	and	the	fact	that	it	is	so	hard	for	us	to	think	50	,	100	,	or	1,000	 year 	 s 	 	out	.
and	i	think	by	giving	 kid 	 s 	 	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	and	 lett 	 ing 	 	them	 re 	 play 	 	 dynamic 	 s 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	long	-	term	 dynamic 	 s 	 	over	the	short	term	,	and	 get 	 ting 	 	some	sense	of	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	now	,	what	it	's	going	to	be	like	in	100	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	think	 prob 	 ably 	 	is	the	most	effective	thing	i	can	be	 do 	 ing 	 	to	help	the	world	.
and	so	that	's	why	i	think	,	 personal 	 ly 	 	,	that	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	can	change	the	world	.
thank	you	.
