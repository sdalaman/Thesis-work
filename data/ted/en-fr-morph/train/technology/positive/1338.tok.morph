the	maxim	,	``	know	 thy 	 self 	 	``	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	around	since	the	ancient	greeks	.
some	 attribut 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 gold 	 en 	 	world	knowledge	to	plato	,	 other 	 s 	 	to	pythagoras	.
but	the	truth	is	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	matter	which	 s 	 age 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	it	first	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	still	 s 	 age 	 	 ad 	 vice 	 	,	even	 to 	 day 	 	.
``	know	 thy 	 self 	 	.	``
it	's	 pit 	 hy 	 	 al 	 most 	 	to	the	point	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 meaning 	 less 	 	,	but	it	 ring 	 s 	 	familiar	and	true	,	 do 	 es 	 	n't	it	?
``	know	 thy 	 self 	 	.	``
i	understand	 th 	 is 	 	 time 	 less 	 	 dict 	 um 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 state 	 ment 	 	about	the	 problem 	 s 	 	,	or	more	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	 con 	 fusion 	 s 	 	,	of	 conscious 	 ness 	 	.
i	've	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 fascinate 	 d 	 	with	 know 	 ing 	 	the	self	.
 th 	 is 	 	 fasci 	 nation 	 	led	me	to	 sub 	 merge 	 	 my 	 self 	 	in	art	,	 stud 	 y 	 	 neuro 	 science 	 	and	 lat 	 er 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	 psycho 	 therapist 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	i	combine	all	my	 pass 	 ions 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	ceo	of	interaxon	,	a	thought	-	controlled	computing	company	.
my	goal	,	 quit 	 e 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	,	is	to	help	people	 be 	 come 	 	more	in	tune	with	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
i	take	it	from	 th 	 is 	 	little	 dict 	 um 	 	,	``	know	 thy 	 self 	 	.	``
if	you	think	about	it	,	 th 	 is 	 	 imper 	 ative 	 	is	kind	of	the	 defi 	 ning 	 	 character 	 istic 	 	of	our	species	,	is	n't	it	?
i	mean	,	it	's	self	-	 aware 	 ness 	 	that	 separat 	 es 	 	homo	 sapien 	 s 	 	from	 ear 	 lier 	 	 in 	 stance 	 s 	 	of	our	 man 	 kind 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	we	're	often	too	 bus 	 y 	 	 tend 	 ing 	 	to	our	iphones	and	ipods	to	 re 	 ally 	 	stop	and	get	to	know	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
under	the	 del 	 uge 	 	of	minute	-	to	-	minute	text	 conversation 	 s 	 	,	 email 	 s 	 	,	 relent 	 less 	 	 ex 	 change 	 	of	media	 channel 	 s 	 	and	 pass 	 word 	 s 	 	and	 app 	 s 	 	and	 re 	 mind 	 ers 	 	and	 tweet 	 s 	 	and	 tag 	 s 	 	,	we	lose	sight	of	what	all	 th 	 is 	 	 fu 	 s 	 s 	 	is	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	about	in	the	first	place	:	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
much	of	the	time	we	're	 trans 	 fix 	 ed 	 	by	all	of	the	ways	we	can	reflect	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	world	.
and	we	can	 bare 	 ly 	 	find	the	time	to	reflect	 deep 	 ly 	 	back	in	on	our	own	 s 	 elves 	 	.
we	've	 cl 	 utter 	 ed 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	up	with	all	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	we	feel	like	we	have	to	get	far	,	far	away	to	a	 s 	 e 	 clud 	 ed 	 	 re 	 treat 	 	,	 leav 	 ing 	 	it	all	 be 	 hind 	 	.
so	we	go	far	away	to	the	top	of	a	mountain	,	 assum 	 ing 	 	that	 per 	 ch 	 ing 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	on	a	piece	is	bound	to	give	us	the	 re 	 spite 	 	we	need	to	sort	the	 cl 	 utter 	 	,	the	chaotic	 every 	 day 	 	,	and	find	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
but	on	that	mountain	where	we	gain	that	 beaut 	 iful 	 	peace	of	mind	,	what	are	we	 re 	 ally 	 	 achiev 	 ing 	 	?
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	a	 success 	 ful 	 	 es 	 cape 	 	.
think	of	the	term	we	use	,	``	 re 	 treat 	 	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	term	that	 arm 	 ies 	 	use	when	they	've	lost	a	battle	.
it	 mean 	 s 	 	we	've	got	to	get	out	of	here	.
is	 th 	 is 	 	how	we	feel	about	the	 pressure 	 s 	 	of	our	world	,	that	in	order	to	get	 in 	 side 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	you	have	to	run	for	the	 hill 	 s 	 	?
and	the	problem	with	 es 	 cap 	 ing 	 	your	day	-	to	-	day	life	is	that	you	have	to	come	home	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	.
so	when	you	think	about	it	,	we	're	 al 	 most 	 	like	a	tourist	 visit 	 ing 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	over	there	.
and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	that	 vac 	 ation 	 	's	got	to	come	to	an	end	.
so	my	question	to	you	is	,	can	we	find	ways	to	know	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 with 	 out 	 	the	 es 	 cape 	 	?
can	we	 re 	 define 	 	our	relationship	with	the	 techno 	 log 	 ized 	 	world	in	order	to	have	the	 height 	 ened 	 	sense	of	self	-	 aware 	 ness 	 	that	we	seek	?
can	we	live	here	and	now	in	our	wired	web	and	still	follow	 t 	 hose 	 	ancient	 instruct 	 ions 	 	,	``	know	 thy 	 self 	 	?	``
i	say	the	answer	is	 y 	 es 	 	.
and	i	'm	here	 to 	 day 	 	to	share	a	new	way	that	we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	with	technology	to	 th 	 is 	 	end	to	get	familiar	with	our	inner	self	like	never	before	--	 human 	 izing 	 	technology	and	 further 	 ing 	 	that	age	-	old	quest	of	 our 	 s 	 	to	more	fully	know	the	self	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	thought	-	controlled	computing	.
you	may	or	may	not	have	 notice 	 d 	 	that	i	'm	 wear 	 ing 	 	a	 tin 	 y 	 	 electro 	 de 	 	on	my	 fore 	 head 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 brain 	 wave 	 	sensor	that	's	 read 	 ing 	 	the	 electric 	 al 	 	activity	of	my	brain	 a 	 s 	 	i	give	 th 	 is 	 	talk	.
these	 brain 	 wave 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 analyz 	 ed 	 	and	we	can	see	them	 a 	 s 	 	a	graph	.
let	me	show	you	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
that	blue	line	there	is	my	 brain 	 wave 	 	.
it	's	the	direct	signal	 be 	 ing 	 	 record 	 ed 	 	from	my	head	,	 render 	 ed 	 	in	real	time	.
the	green	and	red	 bar 	 s 	 	show	that	same	signal	 dis 	 play 	 ed 	 	by	frequency	,	with	lower	 fr 	 equ 	 encies 	 	here	and	 high 	 er 	 	 fr 	 equ 	 encies 	 	up	here	.
you	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	looking	 in 	 side 	 	my	head	 a 	 s 	 	i	speak	.
these	 graph 	 s 	 	are	 compel 	 ling 	 	,	they	're	 undul 	 ating 	 	,	but	from	a	human	's	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	they	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	not	 ver 	 y 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	.
that	's	why	we	've	 s 	 pent 	 	a	lot	of	time	 think 	 ing 	 	about	how	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	data	 meaning 	 ful 	 	to	the	people	who	use	it	.
for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	what	if	i	could	use	 th 	 is 	 	data	to	find	out	how	 relax 	 ed 	 	i	am	at	any	moment	?
or	what	if	i	can	take	that	information	and	put	it	 in 	 to 	 	an	 organ 	 ic 	 	shape	up	on	the	screen	?
the	shape	on	the	right	over	here	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	an	 indic 	 ator 	 	of	what	's	going	on	in	my	head	.
the	more	 relax 	 ed 	 	i	am	,	the	more	the	energy	's	going	to	fall	through	it	.
i	may	 al 	 so 	 	be	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 know 	 ing 	 	how	focused	i	am	,	so	i	can	put	my	level	of	attention	 in 	 to 	 	the	circuit	board	on	the	other	side	.
and	the	more	focused	my	brain	is	,	the	more	the	circuit	board	is	going	to	 s 	 urge 	 	with	energy	.
 ordinari 	 ly 	 	,	i	would	have	no	way	of	 know 	 ing 	 	how	focused	or	 relax 	 ed 	 	i	was	in	any	tangible	way	.
 a 	 s 	 	we	know	,	our	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	about	how	we	're	 feel 	 ing 	 	are	 notorious 	 ly 	 	 un 	 reli 	 able 	 	.
we	've	all	had	stress	creep	up	on	us	 with 	 out 	 	even	 not 	 ic 	 ing 	 	it	 un 	 til 	 	we	lost	it	on	 some 	 one 	 	who	did	n't	deserve	it	,	and	then	we	 real 	 ize 	 	that	we	 prob 	 ably 	 	should	have	 check 	 ed 	 	in	with	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	a	little	 ear 	 lier 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	new	 aware 	 ness 	 	 open 	 s 	 	up	vast	 possibil 	 ities 	 	for	 application 	 s 	 	that	help	improve	our	 live 	 s 	 	and	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	create	technology	that	uses	the	 in 	 sight 	 s 	 	to	make	our	work	more	efficient	,	our	 break 	 s 	 	more	 relax 	 ing 	 	and	our	 connect 	 ions 	 	 deep 	 er 	 	and	more	 fulfill 	 ing 	 	than	ever	.
i	'm	going	to	share	some	of	these	 vision 	 s 	 	with	you	in	a	bit	,	but	first	i	want	to	take	a	look	at	how	we	got	here	.
by	the	way	,	feel	free	to	check	in	on	my	head	at	any	time	.
my	team	at	interaxon	and	i	have	 be 	 en 	 	 develop 	 ing 	 	throught	-	controlled	application	for	 al 	 most 	 	a	decade	now	.
in	the	first	phase	of	 develop 	 ment 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 en 	 thus 	 ed 	 	by	all	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	could	control	with	our	mind	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	making	 thing 	 s 	 	activate	,	light	up	and	work	just	by	 think 	 ing 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 transcend 	 ing 	 	the	space	between	the	mind	and	the	 de 	 vice 	 	.
we	 br 	 ought 	 	to	life	a	vast	array	of	 prototype 	 s 	 	and	 product 	 s 	 	that	you	could	control	with	your	mind	,	like	thought	-	controlled	home	 appli 	 ance 	 s 	 	or	 s 	 lot 	 	car	 game 	 s 	 	or	video	 game 	 s 	 	or	a	 levit 	 ating 	 	chair	.
we	 create 	 d 	 	technology	and	 application 	 s 	 	that	 engag 	 ed 	 	people	's	 imagin 	 ations 	 	,	and	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	.
and	then	we	 we 	 re 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	big	for	the	olympics	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 invit 	 ed 	 	to	create	a	massive	 install 	 ation 	 	at	the	vancouver	2010	winter	olympics	,	 we 	 re 	 	used	in	vancouver	,	got	to	control	the	 light 	 ing 	 	on	the	c.n	.	tower	,	the	canadian	parliament	 building 	 s 	 	and	niagara	 fall 	 s 	 	from	all	the	way	 a 	 cross 	 	the	country	using	 the 	 ir 	 	 mind 	 s 	 	.
over	17	 day 	 s 	 	at	the	olympics	7,000	 visit 	 ors 	 	from	all	over	the	world	 actual 	 ly 	 	got	to	 individual 	 ly 	 	control	the	light	from	the	c.n	.	tower	,	parliament	and	niagara	in	real	time	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 mind 	 s 	 	from	 a 	 cross 	 	the	country	,	3,000	km	away	.
so	 controll 	 ing 	 	stuff	with	your	mind	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	cool	.
but	we	're	 al 	 ways 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	multi	-	tiered	 level 	 s 	 	of	human	 interact 	 ion 	 	.
and	so	we	 beg 	 an 	 	looking	 in 	 to 	 	 invent 	 ing 	 	thought	-	controlled	 application 	 s 	 	in	a	more	complex	frame	than	just	control	.
and	that	was	 respons 	 ive 	 ness 	 	.
we	 real 	 ized 	 	that	we	had	a	system	that	 allow 	 ed 	 	technology	to	know	 some 	 thing 	 	about	you	.
and	it	could	join	 in 	 to 	 	the	relationship	with	you	.
we	 create 	 d 	 	the	 respons 	 ive 	 	room	where	the	 light 	 s 	 	music	and	 blind 	 s 	 	 adjust 	 ed 	 	to	your	state	.
they	 follow 	 ed 	 	these	little	 shift 	 s 	 	in	your	mental	activity	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	you	 settl 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 relax 	 ation 	 	at	the	end	of	a	hard	day	,	on	the	couch	in	our	 off 	 ice 	 	,	the	music	would	 mel 	 low 	 	with	you	.
when	you	read	,	the	desk	lamp	would	get	 bright 	 er 	 	.
if	you	nod	off	,	the	system	would	know	,	 dimm 	 ing 	 	to	 dark 	 ness 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	do	.
we	then	 real 	 ized 	 	that	if	technology	could	know	 some 	 thing 	 	about	you	and	use	it	to	help	you	,	there	's	an	even	more	 valu 	 able 	 	application	than	that	.
that	you	could	know	 some 	 thing 	 	about	 your 	 self 	 	.
we	could	know	 side 	 s 	 	of	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	all	but	 in 	 visible 	 	and	come	to	see	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 previous 	 ly 	 	 hid 	 den 	 	.
let	me	show	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	what	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	here	.
here	's	an	application	that	i	 create 	 d 	 	for	the	ipad	.
so	the	goal	of	the	original	game	zen	bound	is	to	wrap	a	rope	around	a	 wood 	 en 	 	form	.
so	you	use	it	with	your	 head 	 set 	 	.
the	 head 	 set 	 	 connect 	 s 	 	 wire 	 lessly 	 	to	an	ipad	or	a	 smart 	 phone 	 	.
in	that	 head 	 set 	 	you	have	fabric	 sensor 	 s 	 	on	your	 fore 	 head 	 	and	above	the	ear	.
in	the	original	zen	bound	game	,	you	play	it	by	 scroll 	 ing 	 	your	 finger 	 s 	 	over	the	pad	.
in	the	game	that	we	 create 	 d 	 	,	of	course	,	you	control	the	 wood 	 en 	 	form	that	's	on	the	screen	there	with	your	mind	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	focus	on	the	 wood 	 en 	 	form	,	it	 rot 	 ates 	 	.
the	more	you	focus	,	the	 fast 	 er 	 	the	 rot 	 ation 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	for	real	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	fake	.
what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	me	 th 	 ough 	 	is	at	the	end	of	the	game	you	get	 stat 	 s 	 	and	 feed 	 back 	 	about	how	you	did	.
you	have	 graph 	 s 	 	and	 chart 	 s 	 	that	tell	you	how	your	brain	was	 do 	 ing 	 	--	not	just	how	much	rope	you	used	or	what	your	high	score	is	,	but	what	was	going	on	 in 	 side 	 	of	your	mind	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 valu 	 able 	 	 feed 	 back 	 	that	we	can	use	to	understand	what	's	going	on	 in 	 side 	 	of	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
i	like	to	call	 th 	 is 	 	``	intra	-	active	.	``
 normal 	 ly 	 	we	think	about	technology	 a 	 s 	 	 inter 	 active 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	technology	is	intra	-	active	.
it	 understand 	 s 	 	what	's	 in 	 side 	 	of	you	and	 build 	 s 	 	a	sort	of	 respons 	 ive 	 	relationship	between	you	and	your	technology	so	that	you	can	use	 th 	 is 	 	information	to	move	you	forward	.
so	you	can	use	 th 	 is 	 	information	to	understand	you	in	a	 respons 	 ive 	 	loop	.
at	interaxon	,	intra	-	active	technology	is	one	of	our	 re 	 ally 	 	 defi 	 ning 	 	 man 	 date 	 s 	 	.
it	's	how	we	understand	the	world	 in 	 side 	 	and	reflect	it	 out 	 side 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	tight	loop	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	thought	-	controlled	computing	can	teach	children	with	add	how	to	improve	 the 	 ir 	 	focus	.
with	add	,	children	have	a	low	proportion	of	beta	 wave 	 s 	 	for	focus	 state 	 s 	 	and	a	high	proportion	of	 the 	 ta 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
so	you	can	create	 application 	 s 	 	that	reward	focused	brain	 state 	 s 	 	.
so	you	can	imagine	 kid 	 s 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	video	 game 	 s 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	brain	 wave 	 s 	 	and	 improv 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	add	 symptom 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	do	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	can	be	 a 	 s 	 	effective	 a 	 s 	 	ritalin	.
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	even	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	thought	-	controlled	computing	can	give	children	with	add	 in 	 sight 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 fluctu 	 ating 	 	mental	 state 	 s 	 	,	so	they	can	better	understand	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	 need 	 s 	 	.
the	way	these	children	will	be	able	to	use	 the 	 ir 	 	new	 aware 	 ness 	 	to	improve	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	will	 up 	 end 	 	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 dam 	 aging 	 	and	 wide 	 spread 	 	social	 stigma 	 s 	 	that	people	who	are	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	different	are	 challeng 	 ed 	 	with	.
we	can	peer	 in 	 side 	 	our	 head 	 s 	 	and	interact	with	what	was	once	 lock 	 ed 	 	away	from	us	,	what	once	 myst 	 ified 	 	and	 separat 	 ed 	 	us	.
 brain 	 wave 	 	technology	can	understand	us	,	 anticip 	 ate 	 	our	 emotion 	 s 	 	and	find	the	best	 solution 	 s 	 	for	our	 need 	 s 	 	.
imagine	 th 	 is 	 	 collect 	 ed 	 	 aware 	 ness 	 	of	the	individual	 compute 	 d 	 	and	 reflect 	 ed 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	an	entire	 life 	 span 	 	.
imagine	the	 in 	 sight 	 s 	 	that	you	can	gain	from	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	second	sight	.
it	would	be	like	 plug 	 ging 	 	 in 	 to 	 	your	own	personal	google	.
on	the	subject	of	google	,	 to 	 day 	 	you	can	search	and	tag	 image 	 s 	 	based	on	the	 thought 	 s 	 	and	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	you	had	while	you	 watch 	 ed 	 	them	.
you	can	tag	 picture 	 s 	 	of	baby	 animal 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	happy	,	or	 what 	 ever 	 	baby	 animal 	 s 	 	are	to	you	,	and	then	you	can	search	that	 data 	 base 	 	,	 navig 	 ating 	 	with	your	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	the	 key 	 word 	 s 	 	that	just	hint	at	them	.
or	you	could	tag	facebook	 photo 	 s 	 	with	the	 emotion 	 s 	 	that	you	had	 associate 	 d 	 	with	 t 	 hose 	 	 memor 	 ies 	 	and	then	 instant 	 ly 	 	 priori 	 tize 	 	the	 stream 	 s 	 	that	catch	your	attention	,	just	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 human 	 izing 	 	technology	is	about	taking	what	's	 al 	 ready 	 	natural	about	the	human	-	tech	experience	and	building	technology	 seam 	 lessly 	 	in	tandem	with	it	.
 a 	 s 	 	it	 align 	 s 	 	with	our	human	 behavior 	 s 	 	,	it	can	allow	us	to	make	better	sense	of	what	we	do	and	,	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	why	,	creating	a	big	picture	out	of	all	the	 import 	 ant 	 	little	 detail 	 s 	 	that	make	up	who	we	are	.
with	 human 	 ized 	 	technology	we	can	monitor	the	quality	of	your	sleep	 cycle 	 s 	 	.
when	our	 product 	 ivity 	 	 start 	 s 	 	to	 s 	 lack 	 en 	 	,	we	can	go	back	to	that	data	and	see	how	we	can	make	more	effective	balance	between	work	and	play	.
do	you	know	what	 cause 	 s 	 	fatigue	in	you	or	what	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	out	your	 energ 	 etic 	 	self	,	what	 trigger 	 s 	 	cause	you	to	be	 depress 	 ed 	 	or	what	 f 	 un 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	are	going	to	 br 	 ing 	 	you	out	of	that	funk	?
imagine	if	you	had	access	to	data	that	 allow 	 ed 	 	you	to	rank	on	a	scale	of	 over 	 all 	 	happiness	which	people	in	your	life	made	you	the	 hap 	 pies 	 t 	 	,	or	what	 activ 	 ities 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	you	joy	.
would	you	make	more	time	for	 t 	 hose 	 	people	?	would	you	 priori 	 tize 	 	?
would	you	get	a	divorce	?
what	thought	-	controlled	computing	can	allow	you	to	do	is	build	 color 	 ful 	 	 layer 	 ed 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	of	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
and	with	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	can	get	the	 skin 	 ny 	 	on	our	 psycho 	 logical 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	build	a	story	of	our	 behavior 	 s 	 	over	time	.
we	can	begin	to	see	the	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	 narrative 	 s 	 	that	propel	us	forward	and	tell	us	about	what	's	going	on	.
and	from	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	can	learn	how	to	change	the	plot	,	the	 out 	 come 	 	and	the	character	of	our	personal	 st 	 ories 	 	.
two	millennia	ago	,	 t 	 hose 	 	greeks	had	some	 power 	 ful 	 	 in 	 sight 	 s 	 	.
they	 k 	 new 	 	that	a	fundamental	piece	 fall 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	place	when	you	start	to	live	out	 the 	 ir 	 	little	phrase	,	when	you	come	 in 	 to 	 	contact	with	 your 	 self 	 	.
they	 under 	 stood 	 	the	power	of	human	narrative	and	the	value	that	we	place	on	 human 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	changing	,	 evolv 	 ing 	 	and	growing	.
but	they	 under 	 stood 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	more	fundamental	--	the	 she 	 er 	 	joy	in	 discover 	 y 	 	,	the	 de 	 light 	 	and	 fasci 	 nation 	 	that	we	get	from	the	world	and	 be 	 ing 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	it	,	the	 rich 	 ness 	 	that	we	get	from	 see 	 ing 	 	,	 feel 	 ing 	 	and	 know 	 ing 	 	the	 live 	 s 	 	that	we	are	.
my	mom	's	an	artist	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	a	child	i	'd	often	see	her	 br 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	to	life	with	the	stroke	of	a	brush	.
one	moment	it	was	all	white	space	,	 pur 	 e 	 	 possibil 	 ity 	 	.
the	next	,	it	was	 al 	 ive 	 	with	her	 color 	 ful 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	and	 express 	 ions 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 at 	 	easel	-	side	,	 watch 	 ing 	 	her	transform	canvas	after	canvas	,	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	you	could	create	your	own	world	.
i	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	our	own	inner	 world 	 s 	 	--	our	 idea 	 s 	 	,	 emotion 	 s 	 	and	 imagin 	 ations 	 	--	 we 	 re 	 	,	in	fact	,	not	bound	by	our	 brain 	 s 	 	and	bodies	.
if	you	could	think	it	,	if	you	could	discover	it	,	you	could	 br 	 ing 	 	it	to	life	.
to	me	,	thought	-	controlled	computing	is	 a 	 s 	 	simple	and	 power 	 ful 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 paint 	 brush 	 	--	one	more	tool	to	 un 	 lock 	 	and	enliven	the	 hid 	 den 	 	 world 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	us	.
i	look	forward	to	the	day	that	i	can	 s 	 it 	 	 be 	 side 	 	you	,	easel	-	side	,	 watch 	 ing 	 	the	world	that	we	can	create	with	our	new	 tool 	 boxes 	 	and	the	 discover 	 ies 	 	that	we	can	make	about	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
thank	you	.
