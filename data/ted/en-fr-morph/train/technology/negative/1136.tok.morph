phyllis	rodriguez	:	we	are	here	 to 	 day 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	fact	that	we	have	what	most	people	consider	an	 un 	 usual 	 	 friend 	 ship 	 	.
and	it	is	.
and	yet	,	it	 feel 	 s 	 	natural	to	us	now	.
i	first	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	my	son	had	 be 	 en 	 	in	the	world	trade	center	on	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	of	september	11th	,	2001	.
we	did	n't	know	if	he	had	 perish 	 ed 	 	yet	 un 	 til 	 	36	 hour 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
at	the	time	,	we	 k 	 new 	 	that	it	was	 politic 	 al 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 af 	 raid 	 	of	what	our	country	was	going	to	do	in	the	name	of	our	son	--	my	husband	,	orlando	,	and	i	and	our	family	.
and	when	i	saw	it	--	and	yet	,	through	the	shock	,	the	 terr 	 ible 	 	shock	,	and	the	 terr 	 ible 	 	explosion	in	our	 live 	 s 	 	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	not	 venge 	 ful 	 	.
and	a	couple	of	 week 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	when	zacarias	moussaoui	was	 indic 	 ted 	 	on	six	 count 	 s 	 	of	 conspi 	 racy 	 	to	commit	 terror 	 ism 	 	,	and	the	u.s.	government	 call 	 ed 	 	for	a	death	 penal 	 ty 	 	for	him	,	if	 convict 	 ed 	 	,	my	husband	and	i	spoke	out	in	 op 	 position 	 	to	that	,	 public 	 ly 	 	.	through	that	and	through	human	 right 	 s 	 	 group 	 s 	 	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	together	with	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	other	 victim 	 s 	 	'	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	.	when	i	saw	aicha	in	the	media	,	coming	over	when	her	son	was	 indic 	 ted 	 	,	and	i	thought	,	``	what	a	brave	woman	.	 some 	 day 	 	i	want	to	meet	that	woman	when	i	'm	 strong 	 er 	 	.	``
i	was	still	in	deep	grief	;	i	 k 	 new 	 	i	did	n't	have	the	strength	.
i	 k 	 new 	 	i	would	find	her	 some 	 day 	 	,	or	we	would	find	each	other	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	when	people	heard	that	my	son	was	a	victim	,	i	got	 im 	 mediate 	 	 sympath 	 y 	 	.
but	when	people	 learn 	 ed 	 	what	her	son	was	 accus 	 ed 	 	of	,	she	did	n't	get	that	 sympath 	 y 	 	.
but	her	 suffer 	 ing 	 	is	equal	to	mine	.
so	we	met	in	november	2002	,
and	aicha	will	now	tell	you	how	that	came	about	.
aicha	el-wafi	:	good	afternoon	,	 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	.
i	am	the	mother	of	zacarias	moussaoui	.
and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	 organ 	 ization 	 	of	human	 right 	 s 	 	to	put	me	in	touch	with	the	 parent 	 s 	 	of	the	 victim 	 s 	 	.
so	they	 introduc 	 ed 	 	me	to	five	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	.
and	i	saw	phyllis	,	and	i	 watch 	 ed 	 	her	.
she	was	the	 on 	 ly 	 	mother	in	the	group	.
the	 other 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 brother 	 s 	 	,	 sister 	 s 	 	.
and	i	saw	in	her	 eye 	 s 	 	that	she	was	a	mother	,	just	like	me	.
i	 suffer 	 ed 	 	a	lot	 a 	 s 	 	a	mother	.
i	was	married	when	i	was	14	.
i	lost	a	child	when	i	was	15	,	a	second	child	when	i	was	16	.
so	the	story	with	zacarias	was	too	much	 re 	 ally 	 	.
and	i	still	suffer	,	 be 	 cause 	 	my	son	is	like	he	's	buried	 al 	 ive 	 	.
i	know	she	 re 	 ally 	 	 cri 	 ed 	 	for	her	son	.
but	she	 know 	 s 	 	where	he	is	.
my	son	,	i	do	n't	know	where	he	is	.
i	do	n't	know	if	he	's	 al 	 ive 	 	.	i	do	n't	know	if	he	's	 torture 	 d 	 	.
i	do	n't	know	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	him	.
so	that	's	why	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	tell	my	story	,	so	that	my	 suffer 	 ing 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	positive	for	other	women	.
for	all	the	women	,	all	the	 mother 	 s 	 	that	give	life	,	you	can	give	back	,	you	can	change	.
it	's	up	to	us	women	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	are	women	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	love	our	children	.
we	must	be	hand	-	in	-	hand	and	do	 some 	 thing 	 	together	.
it	's	not	against	women	,	it	's	for	us	,	for	us	women	,	for	our	children	.
i	talk	against	violence	,	against	 terror 	 ism 	 	.
i	go	to	 school 	 s 	 	to	talk	to	young	,	muslim	 girl 	 s 	 	so	they	do	n't	accept	to	be	married	against	 the 	 ir 	 	will	 ver 	 y 	 	young	.
so	if	i	can	 s 	 ave 	 	one	of	the	young	 girl 	 s 	 	,	and	avoid	that	they	get	married	and	suffer	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	i	did	,	well	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	good	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	why	i	'm	here	in	front	of	you	.
pr	:	i	would	like	to	say	that	i	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	so	much	from	aicha	,	 start 	 ing 	 	with	that	day	we	had	our	 ver 	 y 	 	first	 meet 	 ing 	 	with	other	family	 member 	 s 	 	--	which	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	private	 meet 	 ing 	 	with	security	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	november	2002	,	and	,	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 af 	 raid 	 	of	the	super	-	 patriot 	 ism 	 	of	that	time	in	the	country	--	 t 	 hose 	 	of	us	family	 member 	 s 	 	.
but	we	 we 	 re 	 	all	so	nervous	.
``	why	 do 	 es 	 	she	want	to	meet	us	?	``	and	then	she	was	nervous	.
``	why	did	we	want	to	meet	her	?	``	what	did	we	want	from	each	other	?
before	we	 k 	 new 	 	each	 other 	 s 	 	'	 name 	 s 	 	,	or	 any 	 thing 	 	,	we	had	 embrace 	 d 	 	and	wept	.	then	we	 s 	 at 	 	in	a	circle	with	support	,	with	help	,	from	people	 experience 	 d 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 reconcili 	 ation 	 	.
and	aicha	 start 	 ed 	 	,	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	do	n't	know	if	my	son	is	 guilt 	 y 	 	or	 innoc 	 ent 	 	,	but	i	want	to	tell	you	how	sorry	i	am	for	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	your	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	.
i	know	what	it	is	to	suffer	,	and	i	feel	that	if	there	is	a	crime	,	a	person	should	be	 tri 	 ed 	 	 fair 	 ly 	 	and	 punish 	 ed 	 	.	``
but	she	 reach 	 ed 	 	out	to	us	in	that	way	,
and	it	was	,	i	'd	like	to	say	,	it	was	an	ice	-	breaker	.
and	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	then	is	we	all	told	our	 st 	 ories 	 	,	and	we	all	 connect 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
by	the	end	of	the	afternoon	--	it	was	about	three	 hour 	 s 	 	after	lunch	--	we	'd	felt	 a 	 s 	 	if	we	'd	known	each	other	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
now	what	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	her	,	is	a	woman	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	who	could	be	so	 gen 	 er 	 ous 	 	under	these	present	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	and	what	it	was	then	,	and	what	was	 be 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	to	her	son	,	but	the	life	she	's	had	.
i	never	had	met	 some 	 one 	 	with	 s 	 uch 	 	a	hard	life	,	from	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 total 	 ly 	 	different	culture	and	environment	from	my	own	.
and	i	feel	that	we	have	a	special	 connect 	 ion 	 	,	which	i	value	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
and	i	think	it	's	all	about	 be 	 ing 	 	 af 	 raid 	 	of	the	other	,
but	making	that	step	and	then	 real 	 izing 	 	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	n't	so	hard	.
who	else	can	i	meet	that	i	do	n't	know	,	or	that	i	'm	so	different	from	?	``
so	,	aicha	,	do	you	have	a	couple	of	 word 	 s 	 	for	 con 	 clusion 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	our	time	is	up	.
aw	:	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	say	that	we	have	to	try	to	know	other	people	,	the	other	.
you	have	to	be	 gen 	 er 	 ous 	 	,	and	your	 heart 	 s 	 	must	be	 gen 	 er 	 ous 	 	,	your	mind	must	be	 gen 	 er 	 ous 	 	.
you	must	be	 toler 	 ant 	 	.
you	have	to	fight	against	violence	.
and	i	hope	that	 some 	 day 	 	we	'll	all	live	together	in	peace	and	 respect 	 ing 	 	each	other	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	say	.
