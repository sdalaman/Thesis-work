if	you	are	a	bit	short	in	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	,
do	n't	worry	.	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	most	 success 	 ful 	 	 scientist 	 s 	 	at	work	 to 	 day 	 	are	 mathematic 	 ally 	 	semi	-	 liter 	 ate 	 	.
a	metaphor	will	serve	here	:	where	elite	 mathematic 	 ians 	 	and	 statistic 	 ians 	 	and	 theor 	 ists 	 	often	serve	 a 	 s 	 	 architect 	 s 	 	in	the	 expand 	 ing 	 	realm	of	science	,	the	 remain 	 ing 	 	large	 major 	 ity 	 	of	 bas 	 ic 	 	 appli 	 ed 	 	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	a	large	 port 	 ion 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	who	could	be	 s 	 aid 	 	to	be	of	the	first	rank	,	are	the	 one 	 s 	 	who	map	the	 terra 	 in 	 	,	they	scout	the	 front 	 ier 	 s 	 	,	they	cut	the	 path 	 ways 	 	,	they	raise	the	 building 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	the	way	.
some	may	have	 consider 	 ed 	 	me	 fool 	 hard 	 y 	 	,	but	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	my	habit	to	brush	 a 	 side 	 	the	fear	of	 mathematic 	 s 	 	when	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	 candid 	 ate 	 	 scientist 	 s 	 	.	 dur 	 ing 	 	41	 year 	 s 	 	of	 teach 	 ing 	 	biology	at	harvard	,	i	 watch 	 ed 	 	 s 	 ad 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	bright	 student 	 s 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	away	from	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	a	scientific	 care 	 er 	 	or	even	from	taking	non	-	 requir 	 ed 	 	 course 	 s 	 	in	science	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 af 	 raid 	 	of	failure	.
these	math	-	phobes	 depriv 	 e 	 	science	and	medicine	of	immeasurable	 amount 	 s 	 	of	 bad 	 ly 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	talent	.	here	's	how	to	relax	your	 anxie 	 ties 	 	,	if	you	have	them	:	understand	that	 mathematic 	 s 	 	is	a	language	 rul 	 ed 	 	like	other	verbal	 language 	 s 	 	,	or	like	verbal	language	 general 	 ly 	 	,	by	 it 	 s 	 	own	 gram 	 mar 	 	and	system	of	logic	.
any	person	with	average	 quant 	 itative 	 	 intellig 	 ence 	 	who	 learn 	 s 	 	to	read	and	write	 mathematic 	 s 	 	at	an	 element 	 ary 	 	level	will	,	 a 	 s 	 	in	verbal	language	,	have	little	 difficult 	 y 	 	 pick 	 ing 	 	up	most	of	the	 fundamental 	 s 	 	if	they	 choos 	 e 	 	to	master	the	mathspeak	of	most	 discipline 	 s 	 	of	science	.
the	 long 	 er 	 	you	wait	to	 be 	 come 	 	at	 l 	 east 	 	semi	-	 liter 	 ate 	 	the	 hard 	 er 	 	the	language	of	 mathematic 	 s 	 	will	be	to	master	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	in	any	verbal	language	,	but	it	can	be	 d 	 one 	 	at	any	age	.
i	speak	 a 	 s 	 	an	 author 	 ity 	 	on	that	subject	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	an	 extrem 	 e 	 	case	.

they	did	n't	teach	it	before	then	.
i	 final 	 ly 	 	got	around	to	 calcul 	 us 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	32	-	year	-	old	 ten 	 ur 	 ed 	 	professor	at	harvard	,	where	i	 s 	 at 	 	 un 	 comfort 	 ably 	 	in	 class 	 es 	 	with	 under 	 graduate 	 	 student 	 s 	 	,	little	more	than	half	my	age	.
a	couple	of	them	 we 	 re 	 	 student 	 s 	 	in	a	course	i	was	giving	on	 evolution 	 ary 	 	biology	.
i	 swallow 	 ed 	 	my	 pri 	 de 	 	,	and	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	 calcul 	 us 	 	.
i	found	out	that	in	science	and	all	 it 	 s 	 	 application 	 s 	 	,	what	is	 cruci 	 al 	 	is	not	that	technical	ability	,	but	it	is	 imagin 	 ation 	 	in	all	of	 it 	 s 	 	 application 	 s 	 	.
the	ability	to	form	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	with	 image 	 s 	 	of	 ent 	 ities 	 	and	 process 	 es 	 	 picture 	 d 	 	by	 intuit 	 ion 	 	.	i	found	out	that	 advance 	 s 	 	in	science	 rare 	 ly 	 	come	 up 	 stream 	 	from	an	ability	to	stand	at	a	 black 	 board 	 	and	conjure	 image 	 s 	 	from	 un 	 fold 	 ing 	 	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 pro 	 position 	 s 	 	and	 equ 	 ations 	 	.

 idea 	 s 	 	emerge	when	a	part	of	the	real	or	 imagin 	 ed 	 	world	is	 stud 	 ied 	 	for	 it 	 s 	 	own	sake	.
of	 fore 	 most 	 	 import 	 ance 	 	is	a	thorough	,	well	-	 organize 	 d 	 	knowledge	of	all	that	is	known	of	the	relevant	 ent 	 ities 	 	and	 process 	 es 	 	that	might	be	 involve 	 d 	 	in	that	domain	you	 pro 	 pose 	 	to	enter	.
when	 some 	 thing 	 	new	is	 discover 	 ed 	 	,	it	's	logical	then	that	one	of	the	follow	-	up	 step 	 s 	 	is	to	find	the	 mathematic 	 al 	 	and	 statistic 	 al 	 	 method 	 s 	 	to	move	 it 	 s 	 	analysis	forward	.
if	that	step	 prove 	 s 	 	too	difficult	for	the	person	or	team	that	made	the	 discover 	 y 	 	,	a	 mathematic 	 ian 	 	can	then	be	 add 	 ed 	 	by	them	 a 	 s 	 	a	 collabor 	 ator 	 	.
consider	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	principle	,	which	i	will	 modest 	 ly 	 	call	wilson	's	principle	number	one	:	it	is	far	 eas 	 ier 	 	for	 scientist 	 s 	 	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	medical	 research 	 ers 	 	,	to	 requir 	 e 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	 collabor 	 ation 	 	in	 mathematic 	 s 	 	and	 statistic 	 s 	 	than	it	is	for	 mathematic 	 ians 	 	and	 statistic 	 ians 	 	to	find	 scientist 	 s 	 	able	to	make	use	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 equ 	 ations 	 	.
it	is	 import 	 ant 	 	in	 choos 	 ing 	 	the	direction	to	take	in	science	to	find	the	subject	at	your	level	of	 compete 	 nce 	 	that	 interest 	 s 	 	you	 deep 	 ly 	 	,	and	focus	on	that	.
keep	in	mind	,	then	,	wilson	's	second	principle	:	for	every	scientist	,	 whet 	 her 	 	 research 	 er 	 	,	technician	,	teacher	,	 manage 	 r 	 	or	 business 	 man 	 	,	 work 	 ing 	 	at	any	level	of	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 compete 	 nce 	 	,	there	 exist 	 s 	 	a	discipline	in	science	or	medicine	for	which	that	level	is	 en 	 ough 	 	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	excellence	.
now	i	'm	going	to	 off 	 er 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	more	 principle 	 s 	 	that	will	be	 use 	 ful 	 	in	 organ 	 izing 	 	your	education	and	 care 	 er 	 	,	or	if	you	're	 teach 	 ing 	 	,	how	you	might	enhance	your	own	 teach 	 ing 	 	and	 counsel 	 ing 	 	of	young	 scientist 	 s 	 	.

but	through	it	all	,	look	for	a	way	to	break	out	,	to	find	a	field	and	subject	not	yet	popular	.

you	may	have	heard	the	 militar 	 y 	 	 dict 	 um 	 	for	the	 gather 	 ing 	 	of	 arm 	 ies 	 	:	march	to	the	sound	of	the	 gun 	 s 	 	.
in	science	,	the	exact	 oppos 	 ite 	 	is	the	case	:	march	away	from	the	sound	of	the	 gun 	 s 	 	.

 observ 	 e 	 	from	a	distance	,	but	do	not	join	the	 f 	 ray 	 	.
make	a	 f 	 ray 	 	of	your	own	.
once	you	have	 settl 	 ed 	 	on	a	 special 	 ty 	 	,	and	the	profession	you	can	love	,	and	you	've	 secure 	 d 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	,	your	potential	to	succeed	will	be	 great 	 ly 	 	 enhance 	 d 	 	if	you	 stud 	 y 	 	it	 en 	 ough 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	an	expert	.
there	are	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 professional 	 ly 	 	delimited	 subject 	 s 	 	sprinkled	through	physics	and	 chemist 	 ry 	 	to	biology	and	medicine	.	and	on	then	 in 	 to 	 	the	social	 science 	 s 	 	,	where	it	is	possible	in	short	time	to	 acquir 	 e 	 	the	 stat 	 us 	 	of	an	 author 	 ity 	 	.

the	answer	 deserve 	 s 	 	to	be	 state 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	principle	number	four	.
in	the	attempt	to	make	scientific	 discover 	 ies 	 	,	every	problem	is	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	,	and	the	more	difficult	the	problem	,	the	 great 	 er 	 	will	be	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	 it 	 s 	 	solution	.

 scientist 	 s 	 	,	 pur 	 e 	 	 mathematic 	 ians 	 	among	them	,	follow	one	or	the	other	of	two	 path 	 ways 	 	:	first	through	early	 discover 	 ies 	 	,	a	problem	is	identified	and	a	solution	is	 s 	 ought 	 	.
the	problem	may	be	 relat 	 ively 	 	small	;	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	where	 exact 	 ly 	 	in	a	 cruis 	 e 	 	ship	 do 	 es 	 	the	norovirus	begin	to	spread	?
or	 large 	 r 	 	,	what	's	the	role	of	dark	matter	in	the	expansion	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	?
 a 	 s 	 	the	answer	is	 s 	 ought 	 	,	other	 phenomen 	 a 	 	are	 typical 	 ly 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	and	other	 question 	 s 	 	are	 ask 	 ed 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	first	of	the	two	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	is	like	a	hunter	,	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	a	forest	in	search	of	a	 part 	 icular 	 	 quar 	 ry 	 	,	who	 find 	 s 	 	other	 quar 	 ries 	 	 a 	 long 	 	the	way	.
the	second	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	of	research	is	to	 stud 	 y 	 	a	subject	 broad 	 ly 	 	 search 	 ing 	 	for	 un 	 known 	 	 phenomen 	 a 	 	or	 pattern 	 s 	 	of	known	 phenomen 	 a 	 	like	a	hunter	in	what	we	call	``	the	 natural 	 ist 	 	's	trance	,	``	the	 research 	 er 	 	of	mind	is	open	to	 any 	 thing 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	any	 quar 	 ry 	 	worth	taking	.
the	search	is	not	for	the	solution	of	the	problem	,	but	for	 problem 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	worth	solving	.
the	two	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	of	research	,	original	research	,	can	be	 state 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 follow 	 s 	 	,	in	the	final	principle	i	'm	going	to	 off 	 er 	 	you	:	for	every	problem	in	a	 give 	 n 	 	discipline	of	science	,	there	 exist 	 s 	 	a	species	or	 ent 	 ity 	 	or	 phenomen 	 on 	 	ideal	for	 it 	 s 	 	solution	.
