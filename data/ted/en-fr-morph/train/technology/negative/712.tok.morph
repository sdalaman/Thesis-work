i	'm	going	to	show	you	how	 terror 	 ism 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 interact 	 s 	 	with	our	 dai 	 ly 	 	life	.
15	 year 	 s 	 	ago	i	 receiv 	 ed 	 	a	phone	call	from	a	friend	.
at	the	time	he	was	looking	after	the	 right 	 s 	 	of	 politic 	 al 	 	 prisoner 	 s 	 	in	italian	 jail 	 s 	 	.
he	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	if	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	interview	the	red	brigades	.
now	,	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	may	remember	,	the	red	brigades	was	a	terrorist	,	marxist	 organ 	 ization 	 	which	was	 ver 	 y 	 	active	in	italy	from	the	1960s	 un 	 til 	 	the	mid	-	1980s	.
 a 	 s 	 	part	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	the	red	brigades	never	spoke	with	 any 	 body 	 	,	not	even	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 lawyer 	 s 	 	.
they	 s 	 at 	 	in	silence	through	 the 	 ir 	 	 trail 	 s 	 	,	 wav 	 ing 	 	 occasion 	 ally 	 	at	family	and	 friend 	 s 	 	.
in	1993	they	 declare 	 d 	 	the	end	of	the	 arm 	 ed 	 	struggle	.
and	they	drew	a	list	of	people	with	whom	they	would	talk	,	and	tell	 the 	 ir 	 	story	.
and	i	was	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	people	.
when	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	my	friend	why	the	red	brigades	want	to	talk	to	me	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	that	the	female	 member 	 s 	 	of	the	 organ 	 ization 	 	had	 actual 	 ly 	 	 support 	 ed 	 	my	name	.
in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	one	person	had	put	it	forward	.
she	was	my	 child 	 hood 	 	friend	.
she	had	 join 	 ed 	 	the	red	brigades	and	 be 	 came 	 	a	 lead 	 er 	 	of	the	 organ 	 ization 	 	.
 natural 	 ly 	 	,	i	did	n't	know	that	 un 	 til 	 	the	day	she	was	 arrest 	 ed 	 	.
in	fact	,	i	read	it	in	the	 news 	 paper 	 	.
at	the	time	of	the	phone	call	i	just	had	a	baby	,
i	 success 	 fully 	 	 complete 	 d 	 	a	management	 buy 	 out 	 	to	the	company	i	was	 work 	 ing 	 	with	,	and	the	last	thing	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	was	to	go	back	home	and	 tour 	 ing 	 	the	high	-	security	 pri 	 son 	 s 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	i	did	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	know	what	had	 turn 	 ed 	 	my	best	friend	 in 	 to 	 	a	terrorist	,	and	why	she	'd	never	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	recruit	me	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	i	did	.
now	,	i	found	the	answer	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	 fail 	 ed 	 	the	 psycho 	 logical 	 	 pro 	 filing 	 	of	a	terrorist	.
the	center	 commit 	 tee 	 	of	the	red	brigades	had	 judg 	 ed 	 	me	too	single	-	minded	and	too	 opinion 	 ated 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	good	terrorist	.
my	friend	,	on	the	other	hand	,	she	was	a	good	terrorist	 be 	 cause 	 	she	was	 ver 	 y 	 	good	at	 follow 	 ing 	 	 order 	 s 	 	.
she	 al 	 so 	 	 embrace 	 d 	 	violence	.	 be 	 cause 	 	she	 believ 	 ed 	 	that	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	to	 un 	 block 	 	what	,	at	the	time	,	was	known	 a 	 s 	 	a	 block 	 ed 	 	 demo 	 cracy 	 	,	italy	,	a	country	run	by	the	same	party	for	35	 year 	 s 	 	was	the	 arm 	 s 	 	struggle	.
at	the	same	time	,	while	i	was	 interview 	 ing 	 	the	red	brigades	,	i	 al 	 so 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	 the 	 ir 	 	life	was	not	 rul 	 ed 	 	by	 politic 	 s 	 	or	 ideo 	 logy 	 	,	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	was	 rul 	 ed 	 	by	 economic 	 s 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 constant 	 ly 	 	short	of	cash	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 constant 	 ly 	 	 search 	 ing 	 	for	cash	.
now	,	 contr 	 ary 	 	to	what	 man 	 y 	 	people	 believ 	 e 	 	,	 terror 	 ism 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	expensive	business	.
i	'll	give	you	an	idea	.
in	the	1970s	,	the	 turn 	 over 	 	of	the	red	brigades	on	a	 year 	 ly 	 	 bas 	 is 	 	was	seven	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 rough 	 ly 	 	between	100	and	150	million	,	 to 	 day 	 	.
now	,	you	know	,	if	you	live	 under 	 ground 	 	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	to	produce	 th 	 is 	 	amount	of	money	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 explain 	 s 	 	why	,	when	i	was	 interview 	 ing 	 	the	red	brigades	,	and	then	,	 lat 	 er 	 	on	,	other	 arm 	 s 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 member 	 s 	 	of	al-zarqawi	group	in	the	middle	east	,	 every 	 body 	 	was	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 reluct 	 ant 	 	to	talk	about	 ideo 	 logy 	 	,	or	 politic 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	they	had	no	idea	.
the	 politic 	 al 	 	vision	of	a	terrorist	 organ 	 ization 	 	is	 decide 	 d 	 	by	the	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	,	which	,	 general 	 ly 	 	,	is	never	more	than	five	to	seven	people	.
all	the	 other 	 s 	 	do	,	day	in	and	day	out	,	is	search	for	money	.
once	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	i	was	 interview 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	part	-	timer	from	the	red	brigades	.
it	was	a	psychiatrist	.	he	 love 	 d 	 	 s 	 ailing 	 	.
he	was	a	 re 	 ally 	 	keen	 sail 	 or 	 	.	and	he	had	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	boat	.
and	he	told	me	that	the	best	time	of	his	life	was	when	he	was	a	member	of	the	red	brigades
and	he	went	 s 	 ailing 	 	,	every	summer	,	back	and	forth	from	lebanon	,	where	he	would	pick	up	soviet	 weapon 	 s 	 	from	the	plo	,	and	then	carry	them	all	the	way	to	sardinia	where	the	other	 arm 	 s 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	from	europe	would	go	and	take	 the 	 ir 	 	share	of	the	 arm 	 s 	 	.
for	that	service	the	red	brigades	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	paid	a	fee	,	which	went	to	fund	 the 	 ir 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	.
so	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	am	a	trained	economist	and	i	think	in	economic	 term 	 s 	 	,	all	of	the	sudden	i	thought	,	 may 	 be 	 	there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	here	.
 may 	 be 	 	there	is	a	link	,	a	commercial	link	,	between	one	 organ 	 ization 	 	and	 an 	 other 	 	one	.
but	it	was	 on 	 ly 	 	when	i	 interview 	 ed 	 	mario	moretti	,	the	head	of	the	red	brigades	,	the	man	who	 kidnap 	 ped 	 	and	 kill 	 ed 	 	aldo	moro	,	italian	 form 	 er 	 	prime	 mini 	 ster 	 	,	that	i	 final 	 ly 	 	 real 	 ized 	 	that	 terror 	 ism 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	business	.
i	was	 hav 	 ing 	 	lunch	with	him	in	a	high	-	security	 pri 	 son 	 	in	italy	.	and	 a 	 s 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	eating	,	i	had	the	distinct	 feel 	 ing 	 	that	i	was	back	in	the	city	of	london	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	lunch	with	a	fellow	 bank 	 er 	 	or	an	economist	.
 th 	 is 	 	guy	thought	in	the	same	way	i	did	.
so	,	i	 decide 	 d 	 	that	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	investigate	the	 economic 	 s 	 	of	 terror 	 ism 	 	.
 natural 	 ly 	 	,	 no 	 body 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	fund	my	research	.
in	fact	,	i	think	 man 	 y 	 	people	thought	that	i	was	a	bit	crazy	.
you	know	,	that	woman	that	 go 	 es 	 	around	to	 found 	 ations 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	for	money	,	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	 economic 	 s 	 	of	 terror 	 ism 	 	.
so	,	in	the	end	,	i	took	a	decision	that	,	in	retrospect	,	did	change	my	life	.
i	 s 	 old 	 	my	company	,	and	funded	the	research	 my 	 self 	 	.
and	what	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	parallel	 re 	 ality 	 	,	 an 	 other 	 	 inter 	 national 	 	economic	system	,	which	 run 	 s 	 	parallel	to	our	own	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 create 	 d 	 	by	 arm 	 s 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	since	the	end	of	world	war	ii	.
and	what	is	even	more	 shock 	 ing 	 	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	system	 ha 	 s 	 	 follow 	 ed 	 	,	step	by	step	,	the	evolution	of	our	own	system	,	of	our	western	 capital 	 ism 	 	.
and	there	are	three	main	 stage 	 s 	 	.
the	first	one	is	the	state	sponsor	of	 terror 	 ism 	 	.
the	second	one	is	the	 privat 	 ization 	 	of	 terror 	 ism 	 	.
and	the	third	,	of	course	,	is	the	 global 	 ization 	 	of	 terror 	 ism 	 	.
so	,	state	sponsor	of	 terror 	 ism 	 	,	feature	of	the	cold	war	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	when	the	two	 super 	 power 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 fight 	 ing 	 	a	war	by	 pr 	 oxy 	 	,	 a 	 long 	 	the	 per 	 iph 	 ery 	 	of	the	sphere	of	influence	,	fully	 fund 	 ing 	 	 arm 	 s 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	.
a	mix	of	legal	and	 il 	 legal 	 	 activ 	 ities 	 	is	used	.
so	,	the	link	between	crime	and	terror	is	 establish 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	early	on	.
and	here	is	the	best	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	the	contras	in	nicaragua	,	 create 	 d 	 	by	the	cia	,	 legal 	 ly 	 	funded	by	the	u.s.	congress	,	 il 	 legal 	 ly 	 	funded	by	the	reagan	 administr 	 ation 	 	via	 cover 	 t 	 	operation	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	the	iran	-	contra	 af 	 fair 	 	.
then	 come 	 s 	 	the	late	1970s	,	early	'80s	,	and	some	 group 	 s 	 	 success 	 fully 	 	carry	out	the	 privat 	 ization 	 	of	 terror 	 ism 	 	.
so	,	they	gain	 in 	 depend 	 ence 	 	from	the	sponsor	,	and	start	 fund 	 ing 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
now	,	 aga 	 in 	 	we	see	a	mix	of	legal	and	 il 	 legal 	 	 activ 	 ities 	 	.
so	,	arafat	used	to	get	a	 percent 	 age 	 	of	the	 s 	 mug 	 gling 	 	of	 hash 	 ish 	 	from	bek√°a	 val 	 ley 	 	,	which	is	the	 val 	 ley 	 	between	lebanon	and	syria	.
and	the	ira	,	which	control	the	private	 transport 	 ation 	 	system	in	 north 	 ern 	 	ireland	,	did	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	thing	.
so	,	every	single	time	that	 some 	 body 	 	got	 in 	 to 	 	a	taxi	in	belfast	 with 	 out 	 	 know 	 ing 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	was	 fund 	 ing 	 	the	ira	.
but	the	great	change	came	,	of	course	,	with	 global 	 ization 	 	and	 de 	 regulat 	 ion 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	when	 arm 	 s 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	link	up	,	 al 	 so 	 	 financial 	 ly 	 	,	with	each	other	.
but	above	all	,	they	 start 	 ed 	 	to	do	serious	business	with	the	world	of	crime	.
and	together	they	money	-	laundered	 the 	 ir 	 	 dirt 	 y 	 	business	through	the	same	channel	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	when	we	see	the	birth	of	the	 trans 	 national 	 	 arm 	 s 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	al	qaeda	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 organ 	 ization 	 	that	can	raise	money	 a 	 cross 	 	border	.
but	 al 	 so 	 	that	is	able	to	carry	out	 attack 	 s 	 	in	more	than	one	country	.
now	,	 de 	 regulat 	 ion 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	back	 r 	 ogue 	 	 economic 	 s 	 	.
so	what	is	 r 	 ogue 	 	 economic 	 s 	 	?
 r 	 ogue 	 	 economic 	 s 	 	is	a	force	which	is	 constant 	 ly 	 	 lurk 	 ing 	 	in	the	 back 	 ground 	 	of	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
it	 come 	 s 	 	back	at	 time 	 s 	 	of	great	 transform 	 ation 	 	,	 global 	 ization 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 transform 	 ations 	 	.
it	is	at	 th 	 is 	 	 time 	 s 	 	in	which	 politic 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 lose 	 s 	 	control	of	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	and	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	 r 	 ogue 	 	force	 work 	 ing 	 	against	us	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	before	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	with	the	fall	of	the	roman	empire	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	with	industrial	revolution	.
and	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	,	with	the	fall	of	the	berlin	wall	.
now	,	i	 calcul 	 ated 	 	how	big	was	 th 	 is 	 	 inter 	 national 	 	economic	system	 compose 	 d 	 	by	crime	,	terror	,	and	 il 	 legal 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	before	9-11	.
and	it	is	a	 stagger 	 ing 	 	1.5	trillion	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
it	is	 trillion 	 s 	 	,	it	's	not	 billion 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	about	twice	the	gdp	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 king 	 dom 	 	,	soon	will	be	more	,	 consider 	 ing 	 	where	 th 	 is 	 	country	is	going	.
now	,	 un 	 til 	 	9-11	,	the	bulk	of	all	 th 	 is 	 	money	flew	 in 	 to 	 	the	u.s.	 eco 	 nomy 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	bulk	of	the	money	was	 denomi 	 nated 	 	in	u.s.	 dollar 	 s 	 
and	the	money	 launder 	 ing 	 	was	taking	place	 in 	 side 	 	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
the	entry	point	,	of	course	,	of	most	of	 th 	 is 	 	money	 we 	 re 	 	the	off	-	shore	 facil 	 ities 	 	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	vital	 inject 	 ion 	 	of	cash	 in 	 to 	 	the	u.s.	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
now	,	when	i	went	to	look	at	the	 figure 	 s 	 	of	the	u.s.	money	supply	,
the	u.s.	money	supply	is	the	amount	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	that	the	federal	 re 	 serve 	 	 print 	 s 	 	every	year	in	order	to	satisfy	the	 in 	 crease 	 	in	the	demand	for	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	which	,	of	course	,	 reflect 	 s 	 	the	growth	of	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
so	,	when	i	went	to	look	at	 t 	 hose 	 	 figure 	 s 	 	,	i	 not 	 ed 	 	that	since	the	late	1960s	a	growing	number	of	these	 dollar 	 s 	 	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 leav 	 ing 	 	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	never	to	come	back	.
these	 we 	 re 	 	money	taken	out	in	 suit 	 case 	 s 	 	or	in	 contain 	 ers 	 	,	in	cash	of	course	.
these	 we 	 re 	 	money	taken	out	by	 criminal 	 s 	 	and	money	 launder 	 ers 	 	.
these	 we 	 re 	 	money	taken	out	to	fund	the	growth	of	the	terror	,	 il 	 legal 	 	and	criminal	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
so	,	you	see	,	what	is	the	relationship	?
the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	is	a	country	that	is	the	 re 	 serve 	 	 curr 	 ency 	 	of	the	world	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	it	mean	?	that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	privilege	that	other	 count 	 ries 	 	do	not	have	.
it	can	borrow	against	the	total	amount	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	 circul 	 ation 	 	in	the	world	.
 th 	 is 	 	privilege	is	 call 	 ed 	 	 seignio 	 rage 	 	.
no	other	country	can	do	that	.
all	the	other	 count 	 ries 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 king 	 dom 	 	,	can	borrow	 on 	 ly 	 	against	the	amount	of	money	in	 circul 	 ation 	 	 in 	 side 	 	 it 	 s 	 	own	 border 	 s 	 	.
so	,	here	is	the	 implic 	 ation 	 	of	the	relationship	between	the	 world 	 s 	 	of	crime	,	terror	,	and	 il 	 legal 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	and	our	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
the	u.s.	in	the	1990s	was	 borrow 	 ing 	 	against	the	growth	of	the	terror	,	 il 	 legal 	 	and	criminal	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	how	close	we	are	with	 th 	 is 	 	world	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	 change 	 d 	 	,	of	course	,	after	9-11	,	 be 	 cause 	 	george	bush	 launch 	 ed 	 	the	war	on	terror	.
part	of	the	war	on	terror	was	the	 introduc 	 tion 	 	of	the	patriot	act	.
now	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	know	that	the	patriot	act	is	a	 legisl 	 ation 	 	that	 great 	 ly 	 	 reduc 	 es 	 	the	 liber 	 ties 	 	of	americans	in	order	to	protect	them	against	 terror 	 ism 	 	.
but	there	is	a	section	of	the	patriot	act	which	 refer 	 s 	 	 specific 	 ally 	 	to	finance	.
and	it	is	,	in	fact	,	an	anti	-	money	-	 launder 	 ing 	 	 legisl 	 ation 	 	.
what	the	patriot	act	did	was	to	prohibit	u.s.	bank	,	and	u.s.	-	 register 	 ed 	 	foreign	 bank 	 s 	 	from	 do 	 ing 	 	any	 business 	 es 	 	with	off	-	shore	 facil 	 ities 	 	.
it	closed	that	door	between	the	money	 launder 	 ing 	 	in	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	and	the	u.s.	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
it	 al 	 so 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	the	u.s.	 mon 	 et 	 ary 	 	 author 	 ities 	 	the	right	to	monitor	any	dollar	 trans 	 action 	 	taking	place	 any 	 where 	 	in	the	world	.
now	,	you	can	imagine	what	was	the	 re 	 action 	 	of	the	 inter 	 national 	 	finance	and	 bank 	 ing 	 	.
all	the	 bank 	 ers 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 client 	 s 	 	,	``	get	out	of	the	 dollar 	 s 	 	and	go	and	invest	 some 	 where 	 	else	.	``
now	,	the	euro	was	a	 new 	 ly 	 	born	 curr 	 ency 	 	of	great	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	for	business	,	and	,	of	course	,	for	 invest 	 ment 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	people	did	.
 no 	 body 	 	 want 	 s 	 	the	u.s.	 mon 	 et 	 ary 	 	 author 	 ity 	 	to	check	 the 	 ir 	 	relationship	,	to	monitor	 the 	 ir 	 	relationship	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 client 	 ele 	 	.
the	same	thing	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	of	course	,	in	the	world	of	crime	and	terror	.
people	 simpl 	 y 	 	 move 	 d 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	money	-	 launder 	 ing 	 	 activ 	 ities 	 	away	from	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	europe	.
why	did	 th 	 is 	 	happen	?	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	patriot	act	was	a	 uni 	 lateral 	 	 legisl 	 ation 	 	.
it	was	 introduc 	 ed 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
and	it	was	 introduc 	 ed 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	for	the	u.s.	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
in	europe	,	a	similar	 legisl 	 ation 	 	was	not	 introduc 	 ed 	 	.
