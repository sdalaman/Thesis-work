i	still	remember	the	day	in	school	when	our	teacher	told	us	that	the	world	population	had	 be 	 come 	 	three	billion	people	,
and	that	was	in	1960	.
i	'm	going	to	talk	now	about	how	world	population	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	from	that	year	and	 in 	 to 	 	the	future	,
but	i	will	not	use	digital	technology	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	my	first	five	tedtalks	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	i	have	 progress 	 ed 	 	,	and	i	am	,	 to 	 day 	 	,	 launch 	 ing 	 	a	brand	new	analog	 teach 	 ing 	 	technology	that	i	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	from	ikea	:	 th 	 is 	 	box	.
 th 	 is 	 	box	 contain 	 s 	 	one	billion	people	.
and	our	teacher	told	us	that	the	 industrial 	 ized 	 	world	,	1960	,	had	one	billion	people	.
in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	,	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	they	had	two	billion	people	.
and	they	lived	away	then	.
there	was	a	big	gap	between	the	one	billion	in	the	 industrial 	 ized 	 	world	and	the	two	billion	in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	.
in	the	 industrial 	 ized 	 	world	,	people	 we 	 re 	 	 health 	 y 	 	,	educated	,	rich	,	and	they	had	small	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	.
and	 the 	 ir 	 	 aspir 	 ation 	 	was	to	buy	a	car	.
and	in	1960	,	all	swedes	 we 	 re 	 	saving	to	try	to	buy	a	volvo	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	the	economic	level	at	which	sweden	was	.	but	in	contrast	to	 th 	 is 	 	,	in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	,	far	away	,	the	 aspir 	 ation 	 	of	the	average	family	there	was	to	have	food	for	the	day	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	saving	to	be	able	to	buy	a	pair	of	 shoe 	 s 	 	.
there	was	an	enormous	gap	in	the	world	when	i	grew	up	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	gap	between	the	west	and	the	rest	 ha 	 s 	 	 create 	 d 	 	a	 mind 	 set 	 	of	the	world	,	which	we	still	use	 linguist 	 ically 	 	when	we	talk	about	``	the	west	``	and	``	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	.	``
but	the	world	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	,	and	it	's	 over 	 due 	 	to	 up 	 grade 	 	that	 mind 	 set 	 	and	that	 tax 	 o 	 nomy 	 	of	the	world	,	and	to	understand	it	.
and	that	's	what	i	'm	going	to	show	you	,
 be 	 cause 	 	since	1960	what	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	world	up	to	2010	is	that	a	 stagger 	 ing 	 	four	billion	people	have	 be 	 en 	 	 add 	 ed 	 	to	the	world	population	.
just	look	how	 man 	 y 	 	.
the	world	population	 ha 	 s 	 	 double 	 d 	 	since	i	went	to	school	.
and	of	course	,	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	economic	growth	in	the	west	.
a	lot	of	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	have	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	grow	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	so	the	western	population	 move 	 d 	 	over	to	here	.
and	now	 the 	 ir 	 	 aspir 	 ation 	 	is	not	 on 	 ly 	 	to	have	a	car	.
now	they	want	to	have	a	 holi 	 day 	 	on	a	 ver 	 y 	 	remote	destination	and	they	want	to	fly	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	they	are	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	the	most	 success 	 ful 	 	of	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	they	have	 move 	 d 	 	on	,	you	know	,
and	they	have	 be 	 come 	 	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	,	we	call	them	.
they	are	now	 buy 	 ing 	 	 car 	 s 	 	.
and	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	a	month	ago	was	that	the	chinese	company	,	geely	,	they	 acquir 	 ed 	 	the	volvo	company	,
and	then	 final 	 ly 	 	the	swedes	 under 	 stood 	 	that	 some 	 thing 	 	big	had	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	world	.
so	there	they	are	.
and	the	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	is	that	the	two	billion	over	here	that	is	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	for	food	and	 shoe 	 s 	 	,	they	are	still	 al 	 most 	 	 a 	 s 	 	poor	 a 	 s 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	50	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
the	new	thing	is	that	we	have	the	 big 	 gest 	 	pile	of	 billion 	 s 	 	,	the	three	 billion 	 s 	 	here	,	which	are	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 coming 	 	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	 quit 	 e 	 	 health 	 y 	 	,	 relat 	 ively 	 	well	-	educated	,	and	they	 al 	 ready 	 	 al 	 so 	 	have	two	to	three	children	per	woman	,	 a 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	[	 rich 	 er 	 	 al 	 so 	 	]	have	.
and	 the 	 ir 	 	 aspir 	 ation 	 	now	is	,	of	course	,	to	buy	a	 bi 	 cycle 	 	,	and	then	 lat 	 er 	 	on	they	would	like	to	have	a	 motor 	 bike 	 	 al 	 so 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	world	we	have	 to 	 day 	 	,
no	 long 	 er 	 	any	gap	.
but	the	distance	from	the	 poor 	 est 	 	here	,	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 poor 	 est 	 	,	to	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 rich 	 est 	 	over	here	is	 wide 	 r 	 	than	ever	.
but	there	is	a	 continu 	 ous 	 	world	from	 walk 	 ing 	 	,	 bi 	 king 	 	,	 driv 	 ing 	 	,	 fly 	 ing 	 	--	there	are	people	on	all	 level 	 s 	 	,
and	most	people	tend	to	be	 some 	 where 	 	in	the	middle	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	new	world	we	have	 to 	 day 	 	in	2010	.
and	what	will	happen	in	the	future	?
well	,	i	'm	going	to	project	 in 	 to 	 	2050	.
i	was	in	shanghai	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,
and	i	 listen 	 ed 	 	to	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	 chin 	 a 	 	,
and	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	that	they	will	catch	up	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	japan	did	.
all	the	 project 	 ions 	 	[	say	that	]	 th 	 is 	 	one	[	billion	]	will	[	 on 	 ly 	 	]	grow	with	one	to	two	or	three	percent	.
[	but	 th 	 is 	 	second	]	 grow 	 s 	 	with	seven	,	eight	percent	,	and	then	they	will	end	up	here	.
they	will	start	 fly 	 ing 	 	.
and	these	lower	or	middle	income	 count 	 ries 	 	,	the	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	income	 count 	 ries 	 	,	they	will	 al 	 so 	 	 for 	 ge 	 	 forward 	 s 	 	 economic 	 ally 	 	.
and	if	,	but	 on 	 ly 	 	if	,	we	invest	in	the	right	green	technology	--	so	that	we	can	avoid	severe	climate	change	,	and	energy	can	still	be	 relat 	 ively 	 	cheap	--	then	they	will	move	all	the	way	up	here	.
and	they	will	start	to	buy	electric	 car 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	will	find	there	.
so	what	about	the	 poor 	 est 	 	two	billion	?
what	about	the	 poor 	 est 	 	two	billion	here	?
will	they	move	on	?
well	,	here	population	[	growth	]	 come 	 s 	 	in	 be 	 cause 	 	there	[	among	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	]	we	 al 	 ready 	 	have	two	to	three	children	per	woman	,	family	 plan 	 ning 	 	is	 wide 	 ly 	 	used	,	and	population	growth	is	coming	to	an	end	.
here	[	among	the	 poor 	 est 	 	]	,	population	is	growing	.
so	these	[	 poor 	 est 	 	]	two	billion	will	,	in	the	next	 decade 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 crease 	 	to	three	billion	,
and	they	will	 there 	 after 	 	 in 	 crease 	 	to	four	billion	.
there	is	 noth 	 ing 	 	--	but	a	nuclear	war	of	a	kind	we	've	never	 s 	 een 	 	--	that	can	stop	 th 	 is 	 	[	growth	]	from	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	 al 	 ready 	 	have	 th 	 is 	 	[	growth	]	in	process	.
but	if	,	and	 on 	 ly 	 	if	,	[	the	 poor 	 est 	 	]	get	out	of	poverty	,	they	get	education	,	they	get	 improv 	 ed 	 	child	 surviv 	 al 	 	,	they	can	buy	a	 bi 	 cycle 	 	and	a	cell	phone	and	come	[	to	live	]	here	,	then	population	growth	will	stop	in	2050	.
we	can	not	have	people	on	 th 	 is 	 	level	looking	for	food	and	 shoe 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	then	we	get	 continu 	 ed 	 	population	growth	.
and	let	me	show	you	why	by	 convert 	 ing 	 	back	to	the	old	-	time	digital	technology	.
here	i	have	on	the	screen	my	country	 bubble 	 s 	 	.
every	bubble	is	a	country	.	the	 s 	 ize 	 	is	population	.
the	 color 	 s 	 	show	the	continent	.
the	yellow	on	there	is	the	americas	;	dark	blue	is	africa	;	 brow 	 n 	 	is	europe	;	green	is	the	middle	east	and	 th 	 is 	 	light	blue	is	south	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	.
that	's	india	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 chin 	 a 	 	.	 s 	 ize 	 	is	population	.
here	i	have	children	per	woman	:	two	children	,	four	children	,	six	children	,	eight	children	--	big	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	,	small	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	.
the	year	is	1960	.
and	down	here	,	child	 surviv 	 al 	 	,	the	 percent 	 age 	 	of	children	 surviv 	 ing 	 	 child 	 hood 	 	up	to	 start 	 ing 	 	school	:
60	percent	,	70	percent	,	80	percent	,	90	,	and	 al 	 most 	 	100	percent	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	have	 to 	 day 	 	in	the	 wealth 	 iest 	 	and	 health 	 iest 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	.
but	look	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	world	my	teacher	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	in	1960	:
one	billion	western	world	here	--	high	child	-	 surviv 	 al 	 	,	small	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	--
and	all	the	rest	,	the	 rain 	 bow 	 	of	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	with	 ver 	 y 	 	large	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	and	poor	child	 surviv 	 al 	 	.
what	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	?	i	start	the	world	.	here	we	go	.
can	you	see	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	 year 	 s 	 	pass	by	,	child	 surviv 	 al 	 	is	increasing	?
they	get	soap	,	 hygien 	 e 	 	,	education	,	 vaccin 	 ation 	 	,	 pen 	 icillin 	 
and	then	family	 plan 	 ning 	 	.	family	 s 	 ize 	 	is	 decr 	 eas 	 ing 	 	.
[	when	]	they	get	up	to	90	-	percent	child	 surviv 	 al 	 	,	then	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	 de 	 crease 	 	,
and	most	of	the	arab	 count 	 ries 	 	in	the	middle	east	is	 fall 	 ing 	 	down	there	[	to	small	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	]	.
look	,	bangladesh	 catch 	 ing 	 	up	with	india	.
the	whole	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	world	 join 	 s 	 	the	western	world	with	good	child	 surviv 	 al 	 	and	small	family	 s 	 ize 	 	,
but	we	still	have	the	 poor 	 est 	 	billion	.
can	you	see	the	 poor 	 est 	 	billion	,	 t 	 hose 	 	[	two	]	boxes	i	had	over	here	?
they	are	still	up	here	.
and	they	still	have	a	child	 surviv 	 al 	 	of	 on 	 ly 	 	70	to	80	percent	,	meaning	that	if	you	have	six	children	born	,	there	will	be	at	 l 	 east 	 	four	who	 surviv 	 e 	 	to	the	next	generation	.
and	the	population	will	double	in	one	generation	.
so	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	of	 re 	 ally 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	world	population	[	growth	]	to	stop	is	to	 continu 	 e 	 	to	improve	child	 surviv 	 al 	 	to	90	percent	.
that	's	why	 invest 	 ments 	 	by	 gate 	 s 	 	 found 	 ation 	 	,	unicef	and	aid	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	,	together	with	national	government	in	the	 poor 	 est 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	are	so	good	;
 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 help 	 ing 	 	us	to	reach	a	 sustain 	 able 	 	population	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	world	.
we	can	stop	at	nine	billion	if	we	do	the	right	 thing 	 s 	 	.
child	 surviv 	 al 	 	is	the	new	green	.
it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	by	child	 surviv 	 al 	 	that	we	will	stop	population	growth	.
and	will	it	happen	?
well	,	i	'm	not	an	optimist	,	 n 	 either 	 	am	i	a	 pessim 	 ist 	 	.
i	'm	a	 ver 	 y 	 	serious	``	 possibil 	 ist 	 	.	``
it	's	a	new	 categor 	 y 	 	where	we	take	emotion	 a 	 part 	 	,	and	we	just	work	 analytic 	 ally 	 	with	the	world	.
it	can	be	 d 	 one 	 	.
we	can	have	a	much	more	just	world	.
with	green	technology	and	with	 invest 	 ments 	 	to	 allevi 	 ate 	 	poverty	,	and	global	 govern 	 ance 	 	,	the	world	can	 be 	 come 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	look	at	the	position	of	the	old	west	.
remember	when	 th 	 is 	 	blue	box	was	all	 al 	 one 	 	,	 lead 	 ing 	 	the	world	,	living	 it 	 s 	 	own	life	.
 th 	 is 	 	will	not	happen	[	 aga 	 in 	 	]	.
the	role	of	the	old	west	in	the	new	world	is	to	 be 	 come 	 	the	 found 	 ation 	 	of	the	modern	world	--	 noth 	 ing 	 	more	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	less	.
but	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	role	.
do	it	well	and	get	used	to	it	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
