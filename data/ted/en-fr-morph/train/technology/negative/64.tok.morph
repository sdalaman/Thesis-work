i	bet	you	're	 worri 	 ed 	 	.
i	was	 worri 	 ed 	 	.	that	's	why	i	 beg 	 an 	 	 th 	 is 	 	piece	.
i	was	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	 vagina 	 s 	 	.	i	was	 worri 	 ed 	 	what	we	think	about	 vagina 	 s 	 	,	and	even	more	 worri 	 ed 	 	that	we	do	n't	think	about	them	.
i	was	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	my	own	vagina	.
it	 need 	 ed 	 	a	 con 	 text 	 	,	a	culture	,	a	community	of	other	 vagina 	 s 	 	.
there	is	so	much	 dark 	 ness 	 	and	secrecy	 surround 	 ing 	 	them	.
like	the	bermuda	triangle	,	 no 	 body 	 	ever	 report 	 s 	 	back	from	there	.
in	the	first	place	,	it	's	not	so	easy	to	even	find	your	vagina	.
women	go	 day 	 s 	 	,	 week 	 s 	 	,	 month 	 s 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	looking	at	it	.
i	 interview 	 ed 	 	a	high	-	powered	 business 	 woman 	 	;	she	told	me	she	did	n't	have	time	.
``	looking	at	your	vagina	,	``	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	is	a	full	day	's	work	.	``
``	you	've	got	to	get	down	there	on	your	back	,	in	front	of	a	mirror	,	full	-	length	 prefer 	 red 	 	.	you	've	got	to	get	in	the	perfect	position	,	with	the	perfect	light	,	which	then	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 shadow 	 ed 	 	by	the	angle	you	're	at	.
you	're	 twist 	 ing 	 	your	head	up	,	 arch 	 ing 	 	your	back	,	it	's	 exhaust 	 ing 	 	.	``	she	was	 bus 	 y 	 	;	she	did	n't	have	time	.
so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	talk	to	women	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 vagina 	 s 	 	.
they	 beg 	 an 	 	 a 	 s 	 	casual	vagina	 interview 	 s 	 	,
and	they	 turn 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	vagina	 monologue 	 s 	 	.
i	 talk 	 ed 	 	with	over	200	women	.	i	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	 old 	 er 	 	women	,	 young 	 er 	 	women	,	married	women	,	 lesbian 	 s 	 	,	single	women	;
i	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	corporate	 professional 	 s 	 	,	college	 professor 	 s 	 	,	 act 	 ors 	 	,	 s 	 ex 	 	 work 	 ers 	 	;	i	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	african	-	american	women	,	asian	-	american	women	,	native	-	american	women	,	caucasian	women	,	jewish	women	.
ok	,	at	first	women	 we 	 re 	 	a	little	 s 	 hy 	 	,	a	little	 reluct 	 ant 	 	to	talk	.
once	they	got	going	,	you	could	n't	stop	them	.
women	love	to	talk	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 vagina 	 s 	 	--	they	do	.
 main 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	no	one	's	ever	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	before	.
let	's	just	start	with	the	word	``	vagina	``	--	vagina	,	vagina	.
it	 sound 	 s 	 	like	an	 infect 	 ion 	 	at	best	.	 may 	 be 	 	a	medical	instrument	.
``	 hur 	 ry 	 	,	nurse	,	 br 	 ing 	 	the	vagina	.	``	vagina	,	vagina	,	vagina	.	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	how	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	you	say	the	word	,	it	never	 sound 	 s 	 	like	a	word	you	want	to	say	.
it	's	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	,	 total 	 ly 	 	un	-	sexy	word	.
if	you	use	it	 dur 	 ing 	 	 s 	 ex 	 	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	be	 politic 	 ally 	 	correct	,	``	 darl 	 ing 	 	,	would	you	stroke	my	vagina	,	``	you	kill	the	act	right	there	.	i	'm	 worri 	 ed 	 	what	we	call	them	and	do	n't	call	them	.
in	great	neck	,	new	york	,	they	call	it	a	``	pussy	-	cat	.	``	a	woman	told	me	there	,	her	mother	used	to	tell	her	,	``	do	n't	wear	 pan 	 ties 	 	,	dear	,	 under 	 neath 	 	your	 pajama 	 s 	 	.	you	need	to	air	out	your	pussy	-	cat	.	``
in	westchester	they	call	it	a	``	pooky	,	``	in	new	jersey	a	``	 tw 	 at 	 	.	``
there	's	powder	-	box	,	 der 	 rier 	 e 	 	,	a	pooky	,	a	 pooch 	 y 	 	,	a	 poop 	 y 	 	,	a	 poop 	 a 	 loo 	 	,	a	pooninana	,	a	 pad 	 epachetchki 	 	,	a	pow	,	and	a	peach	.
there	's	toadie	,	 de 	 e 	 	 de 	 e 	 	,	 nish 	 i 	 	,	dignity	,	 coo 	 chie 	 	 s 	 nor 	 cher 	 	,	cooter	,	 lab 	 i 	 	,	 glad 	 is 	 	 siege 	 l 	 man 	 	,	va	,	wee	-	wee	,	 who 	 re 	 	-	spot	,	 nap 	 py 	 	 d 	 ug 	 out 	 	,	 mun 	 go 	 	,	 ghoul 	 ie 	 	,	powder	-	box	,	a	``	 mim 	 i 	 	``	in	miami	,	a	``	split	 k 	 nish 	 	``	in	philadelphia	,	and	a	``	 sch 	 men 	 de 	 	``	in	the	bronx	.
i	am	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	 vagina 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	how	the	``	vagina	 monologue 	 s 	 	``	 begin 	 s 	 	.
but	it	 re 	 ally 	 	did	n't	begin	there	;	it	 beg 	 an 	 	with	a	conversation	with	a	woman	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	conversation	about	 men 	 o 	 pause 	 	,	and	we	got	onto	the	subject	of	her	vagina	--	which	you	'll	do	if	you	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 men 	 o 	 pause 	 	.
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 shock 	 ed 	 	me	about	her	vagina	--	that	it	was	dried	-	up	and	 finish 	 ed 	 	and	dead	--	and	i	was	kind	of	 shock 	 ed 	 	.
and	so	i	 s 	 aid 	 	to	a	friend	 casual 	 ly 	 	,	``	well	,	what	do	you	think	about	your	vagina	?	``
and	that	woman	 s 	 aid 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	more	 amaz 	 ing 	 	,	and	then	the	next	woman	 s 	 aid 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	more	 amaz 	 ing 	 	,	and	before	i	 k 	 new 	 	it	,	every	woman	was	 tell 	 ing 	 	me	i	had	to	talk	to	 some 	 body 	 	about	 the 	 ir 	 	vagina	 be 	 cause 	 	they	had	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	story	,	and	i	was	 suck 	 ed 	 	down	the	vagina	trail	.
and	i	 re 	 ally 	 	have	n't	gotten	off	it	.	i	think	if	you	had	told	me	when	i	was	 young 	 er 	 	that	i	was	going	to	grow	up	,	and	be	in	shoe	 store 	 s 	 	,	and	people	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	 s 	 cream 	 	out	,	``	there	she	is	,	the	vagina	 lad 	 y 	 	!	``	i	do	n't	know	that	that	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	my	life	 ambit 	 ion 	 	.
but	i	want	to	talk	a	little	bit	about	happiness	and	the	relationship	to	 th 	 is 	 	whole	vagina	journey	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	journey	that	 beg 	 an 	 	eight	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
i	think	before	i	did	the	``	vagina	 monologue 	 s 	 	``	i	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	in	happiness	.
i	thought	that	 on 	 ly 	 	 idiot 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	happy	,	to	be	honest	.
i	remember	when	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 p 	 rac 	 tic 	 ing 	 	buddhism	14	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	i	was	told	that	the	end	of	 th 	 is 	 	practice	was	to	be	happy	,
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	how	could	you	be	happy	and	live	in	 th 	 is 	 	world	of	 suffer 	 ing 	 	and	live	in	 th 	 is 	 	world	of	pain	?	``	i	 mis 	 took 	 	happiness	for	a	lot	of	other	 thing 	 s 	 	,	like	 numb 	 ness 	 	or	 decade 	 nce 	 	or	 self 	 ish 	 ness 	 	.
and	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	through	the	course	of	the	``	vagina	 monologue 	 s 	 	``	and	 th 	 is 	 	journey	is	i	think	i	have	come	to	understand	a	little	bit	more	about	happiness	.
there	're	three	 qual 	 ities 	 	i	want	to	talk	about	.
one	is	 see 	 ing 	 	what	's	right	in	front	of	you	,	and	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	it	,	and	 stat 	 ing 	 	it	.	i	think	what	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	vagina	,	and	 s 	 peaking 	 	about	the	vagina	,	is	it	was	the	most	obvious	thing	--	it	was	right	in	the	center	of	my	body	and	the	center	of	the	world	--	and	yet	it	was	the	one	thing	 no 	 body 	 	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	.
the	second	thing	is	that	what	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	vagina	did	is	it	 open 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	door	which	 allow 	 ed 	 	me	to	see	that	there	was	a	way	to	serve	the	world	to	make	it	better	.
and	that	's	where	the	 deep 	 est 	 	happiness	 ha 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	come	from	.
and	the	third	principle	of	happiness	,	which	i	've	 real 	 ized 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	.
eight	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 th 	 is 	 	 moment 	 um 	 	and	 th 	 is 	 	energy	,	 th 	 is 	 	``	v	-	wave	``	 start 	 ed 	 	--	and	i	can	 on 	 ly 	 	 de 	 scribe 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	``	v	-	wave	``	 be 	 cause 	 	,	to	be	honest	,	i	 re 	 ally 	 	do	n't	understand	it	 complete 	 ly 	 	;	i	feel	at	the	service	of	it	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	wave	 start 	 ed 	 	,	and	if	i	question	the	wave	,	or	try	to	stop	the	wave	or	look	back	at	the	wave	,	i	often	have	the	experience	of	 whip 	 lash 	 	or	the	potential	of	my	neck	 break 	 ing 	 	.	but	if	i	go	with	the	wave	,	and	i	trust	the	wave	and	i	move	with	the	wave	,	i	go	to	the	next	place	,
and	it	 happen 	 s 	 	logically	and	 organ 	 ically 	 	and	 truth 	 fully 	 	.
and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	piece	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	with	 st 	 ories 	 	and	 narrative 	 s 	 	,	and	i	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	one	woman	and	that	led	to	 an 	 other 	 	woman	and	that	led	to	 an 	 other 	 	woman	,	and	then	i	wrote	 t 	 hose 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	down	and	i	put	them	out	in	front	of	other	people	.
and	every	single	time	i	did	the	show	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	women	would	 liter 	 ally 	 	line	up	after	the	show	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	tell	me	 the 	 ir 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	.
and	at	first	i	thought	,	``	oh	great	,	i	'll	hear	about	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 orgasm 	 s 	 	,	and	great	 s 	 ex 	 	 live 	 s 	 	,	and	how	women	love	 the 	 ir 	 	 vagina 	 s 	 	.	``
but	in	fact	,	that	's	not	what	women	lined	up	to	tell	me	.
what	women	lined	up	to	tell	me	was	how	they	 we 	 re 	 	 rap 	 ed 	 	,	and	how	they	 we 	 re 	 	 batt 	 er 	 ed 	 	,	and	how	they	 we 	 re 	 	 beat 	 en 	 	,	and	how	they	 we 	 re 	 	gang	-	 rap 	 ed 	 	in	 park 	 ing 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	,	and	how	they	 we 	 re 	 	 inc 	 est 	 ed 	 	by	 the 	 ir 	 	 uncle 	 s 	 	.
and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	stop	 do 	 ing 	 	the	``	vagina	 monologue 	 s 	 	``	 be 	 cause 	 	it	felt	too	 daunt 	 ing 	 	.	i	felt	like	a	war	 photograph 	 er 	 	who	 take 	 s 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	of	 terr 	 ible 	 	 event 	 s 	 	,	but	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 inter 	 vene 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 be 	 half 	 	.
and	so	in	1997	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	let	's	get	women	together	.
what	could	we	do	with	 th 	 is 	 	information	that	all	these	women	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 viol 	 ated 	 	?	``
and	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	,	after	 think 	 ing 	 	and	 invest 	 ig 	 ating 	 	,	that	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	--	and	the	un	 ha 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	--	that	one	out	of	every	three	women	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	will	be	 beat 	 en 	 	or	 rap 	 ed 	 	in	her	 life 	 time 	 	.
that	's	 essential 	 ly 	 	a	gender	;	that	's	 essential 	 ly 	 	a	resource	of	the	planet	,	which	is	women	.
so	in	1997	we	got	all	these	 in 	 credible 	 	women	together	and	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	how	can	we	use	the	play	,	 th 	 is 	 	energy	,	to	stop	violence	against	women	?	``
and	we	put	on	one	event	in	new	york	city	,	in	the	theater	,	and	all	these	great	 act 	 ors 	 	came	--	from	susan	sarandon	,	to	glenn	close	,	to	whoopi	goldberg	--	and	we	did	one	performance	on	one	 even 	 ing 	 	,	and	that	 catalyze 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	wave	,	 th 	 is 	 	energy	.
and	 with 	 in 	 	five	 year 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	thing	 beg 	 an 	 	to	happen	.
one	woman	took	that	energy	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	want	to	 br 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	wave	,	 th 	 is 	 	energy	,	to	college	 campus 	 es 	 	,	``	and	so	she	took	the	play	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	let	's	use	the	play	and	have	 performance 	 s 	 	of	the	play	once	a	year	,	where	we	can	raise	money	to	stop	violence	against	women	in	local	 commun 	 ities 	 	all	around	the	world	.	``
and	in	one	year	,	it	went	to	50	 college 	 s 	 	,	and	then	it	 expand 	 ed 	 	.
and	over	the	course	of	the	last	six	 year 	 s 	 	,	it	's	spread	and	it	's	spread	and	it	's	spread	and	it	's	spread	around	the	world	.
what	i	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	is	two	 thing 	 s 	 	.	one	:	that	the	 epi 	 demic 	 	of	violence	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	women	is	 shock 	 ing 	 	;	it	's	global	;	it	is	so	 pro 	 found 	 	and	it	is	so	 deva 	 stat 	 ing 	 	,	and	it	is	so	in	every	little	pocket	of	every	little	 crat 	 er 	 	,	of	every	little	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	that	we	do	n't	even	 recogn 	 ize 	 	it	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 be 	 come 	 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	journey	 ha 	 s 	 	taken	me	to	afghanistan	,	where	i	had	the	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	honor	and	privilege	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	 part 	 s 	 	of	afghanistan	under	the	taliban	--	i	was	 dress 	 ed 	 	in	a	burqa	--	and	i	went	in	with	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	group	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 revolution 	 ary 	 	 associ 	 ation 	 	of	the	women	of	afghanistan	,	and	i	saw	 first 	 hand 	 	how	women	had	 be 	 en 	 	 strip 	 ped 	 	of	every	single	right	that	was	possible	to	strip	women	of	--
from	 be 	 ing 	 	educated	,	to	 be 	 ing 	 	 employ 	 ed 	 	,	to	 be 	 ing 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	eat	ice	cream	.
for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	do	n't	know	it	,	it	was	 il 	 legal 	 	to	eat	ice	cream	under	the	taliban	.
and	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	saw	and	met	women	who	had	 be 	 en 	 	 f 	 log 	 ged 	 	by	 be 	 ing 	 	caught	eating	 van 	 illa 	 	ice	cream	.
and	i	was	taken	to	the	secret	ice	cream	-	eating	place	in	a	little	town	,	where	we	went	to	a	back	room	,	and	women	 we 	 re 	 	 seat 	 ed 	 	and	a	 cur 	 tain 	 	was	 pull 	 ed 	 	around	us	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 serv 	 ed 	 	 van 	 illa 	 	ice	cream	.
and	women	 lift 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 burqa 	 s 	 	and	ate	 th 	 is 	 	ice	cream	,	and	i	do	n't	think	i	ever	 under 	 stood 	 	pleasure	 un 	 til 	 	that	moment	,	and	how	women	have	found	a	way	to	keep	 the 	 ir 	 	pleasure	 al 	 ive 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	taken	me	,	 th 	 is 	 	journey	,	to	islamabad	,	where	i	have	 witness 	 ed 	 	and	met	women	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 face 	 s 	 	 melt 	 ed 	 	off	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	taken	me	to	juarez	,	mexico	,	where	i	was	a	week	ago	,	where	i	have	 liter 	 ally 	 	 be 	 en 	 	there	in	 park 	 ing 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	where	 bone 	 s 	 	of	women	have	 wash 	 ed 	 	up	and	 be 	 en 	 	 dump 	 ed 	 	next	to	coca	-	 col 	 a 	 	 bottle 	 s 	 	.

i	have	 s 	 een 	 	 terr 	 ible 	 	,	 terr 	 ible 	 	,	 terr 	 ible 	 	violence	.
but	i	have	 al 	 so 	 	 recogn 	 ized 	 	,	in	the	course	of	 see 	 ing 	 	that	violence	,	that	 be 	 ing 	 	in	the	face	of	 thing 	 s 	 	and	 see 	 ing 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	what	's	in	front	of	us	is	the	antidote	to	 depress 	 ion 	 	and	to	a	 feel 	 ing 	 	that	one	is	 worth 	 less 	 	and	 ha 	 s 	 	no	value	.
 be 	 cause 	 	before	the	``	vagina	 monologue 	 s 	 	,	``	i	will	say	that	80	percent	of	my	 conscious 	 ness 	 	was	closed	off	to	what	was	 re 	 ally 	 	going	on	in	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	.

a	``	vagina	warrior	``	is	a	woman	,	or	a	vagina	-	friendly	man	,	who	 ha 	 s 	 	 witness 	 ed 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	violence	or	 suffer 	 ed 	 	it	,	and	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 get 	 ting 	 	an	ak	-	47	or	a	weapon	of	mass	 destruct 	 ion 	 	or	a	machete	,	they	hold	the	violence	in	 the 	 ir 	 	bodies	;	they	 griev 	 e 	 	it	;	they	experience	it	;	and	then	they	go	out	and	devote	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	to	making	 s 	 ure 	 	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	happen	to	 any 	 body 	 	else	.
i	have	met	these	women	 every 	 where 	 	on	the	planet	.
and	i	want	to	tell	a	few	 st 	 ories 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 st 	 ories 	 	are	the	way	that	we	transmit	information	,	where	it	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	our	bodies	.	and	i	think	that	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	about	 be 	 ing 	 	at	ted	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	that	i	live	in	my	body	a	lot	,	and	i	do	n't	live	in	my	head	 ver 	 y 	 	much	 any 	 more 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 head 	 y 	 	place	.
and	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	be	in	my	head
for	the	last	two	 day 	 s 	 	;	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 dis 	 oriented 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	the	world	,	the	v	-	world	,	is	 ver 	 y 	 	much	in	your	body	.
it	's	a	body	world	,	and	the	species	 re 	 ally 	 	 exist 	 s 	 	in	the	body	,	and	i	think	there	's	a	real	 sign 	 ific 	 ance 	 	in	us	 attach 	 ing 	 	our	bodies	to	our	 head 	 s 	 	--	that	that	 separat 	 ion 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 create 	 d 	 	a	divide	that	is	often	 separat 	 ing 	 	purpose	from	intent	.
and	the	 connect 	 ion 	 	between	body	and	head	often	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 un 	 ion 	 	.
i	want	to	talk	about	three	 part 	 icular 	 	people	that	i	've	met	,	vagina	 warrior 	 s 	 	,	who	 re 	 ally 	 	 transform 	 ed 	 	my	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	whole	principle	and	species	,	and	one	is	a	woman	named	marsha	lopez	.
marsha	lopez	was	a	woman	i	met	in	guatemala	.
she	was	14	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	and	she	was	in	a	marriage	and	her	husband	was	 beat 	 ing 	 	her	on	a	regular	 bas 	 is 	 	,	and	she	could	n't	get	out	 be 	 cause 	 	she	was	 addict 	 ed 	 	to	the	relationship	and	she	had	no	money	.	her	sister	was	 young 	 er 	 	than	her	and	she	 appli 	 ed 	 	--	we	had	a	``	stop	rape	``	contest	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	in	new	york	--	and	she	 appli 	 ed 	 	,	 hop 	 ing 	 	that	she	would	 be 	 come 	 	a	 final 	 ist 	 	and	she	could	 br 	 ing 	 	her	sister	.
she	did	 be 	 come 	 	a	 final 	 ist 	 	;	she	 br 	 ought 	 	marsha	to	new	york	.
and	at	that	time	we	did	 th 	 is 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	v	-	day	at	madison	square	garden	where	we	 s 	 old 	 	out	the	entire	testosterone	-	 fill 	 ed 	 	 dom 	 e 	 	,	18,000	people	 stand 	 ing 	 	up	to	say	``	 y 	 es 	 	``	to	 vagina 	 s 	 	,	which	was	 re 	 ally 	 	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	 transform 	 ation 	 	.
and	she	came	,	and	she	 witness 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	she	 decide 	 d 	 	that	she	would	go	back	and	 leav 	 e 	 	her	husband	,	and	that	she	would	 br 	 ing 	 	v	-	day	to	guatemala	.
she	was	21	 year 	 s 	 	old	.	i	went	to	guatemala	and	she	had	 s 	 old 	 	out	the	national	theater	of	guatemala	.
and	i	 watch 	 ed 	 	her	walk	up	on	stage	in	her	red	short	dress	,	and	high	 heel 	 s 	 	,	and	she	stood	there	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	my	name	is	marsha	.
i	was	 beat 	 en 	 	by	my	husband	for	five	 year 	 s 	 	.
he	 al 	 most 	 	 murder 	 ed 	 	me	.	i	left	and	you	can	too	.	``
and	the	entire	2,000	people	went	 absolute 	 ly 	 	crazy	.
there	's	a	woman	named	esther	chavez	who	i	met	in	juarez	,	mexico	.	and	esther	chavez	was	a	 brilli 	 ant 	 	 account 	 ant 	 	in	mexico	city	;	she	was	72	 year 	 s 	 	old	;	and	she	was	 plan 	 ning 	 	to	retire	.
she	went	to	juarez	to	take	care	of	an	ailing	aunt	,	and	over	the	course	of	it	,	she	 beg 	 an 	 	to	discover	what	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	to	the	 murder 	 ed 	 	and	 disappear 	 ed 	 	women	of	juarez	.
she	 g 	 ave 	 	up	her	life	;	she	 move 	 d 	 	to	juarez	;	she	 start 	 ed 	 	to	write	the	 st 	 ories 	 	which	 document 	 ed 	 	the	 disappear 	 ed 	 	women	.
300	women	have	 disappear 	 ed 	 	in	a	border	town	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 brow 	 n 	 	and	poor	.
there	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	no	 respons 	 e 	 	to	the	 disappear 	 ance 	 	,	and	not	one	person	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	held	 account 	 able 	 	.
she	 beg 	 an 	 	to	document	it	;	she	 open 	 ed 	 	a	center	 call 	 ed 	 	casa	amiga	;	and	in	six	 year 	 s 	 	,	she	 ha 	 s 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	 th 	 is 	 	to	the	 conscious 	 ness 	 	of	the	world	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	there	a	week	ago	,	when	there	 we 	 re 	 	7,000	people	on	the	street	,	and	it	was	 tru 	 ly 	 	a	miracle	.	and	 a 	 s 	 	we	 walk 	 ed 	 	through	the	 street 	 s 	 	,	the	people	of	juarez	,	who	 normal 	 ly 	 	do	n't	even	come	 in 	 to 	 	the	 street 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 street 	 s 	 	are	so	 danger 	 ous 	 	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	stood	there	and	wept	to	see	that	other	people	from	the	world	had	 show 	 ed 	 	up	for	that	 part 	 icular 	 	community	.
there	's	 an 	 other 	 	woman	named	agnes	.	and	agnes	,	for	me	,	 epitomize 	 s 	 	what	a	vagina	warrior	is	.
i	met	her	three	 year 	 s 	 	ago	in	kenya	.	and	agnes	was	 mutilate 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	little	girl	,	she	was	 circum 	 cis 	 ed 	 	against	her	will	when	she	was	10	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	and	she	 re 	 ally 	 	made	a	decision	that	she	did	n't	want	 th 	 is 	 	practice	to	 continu 	 e 	 	 any 	 more 	 	in	her	community	.
so	when	she	got	 old 	 er 	 	she	 create 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	thing	:	it	's	an	 an 	 atomic 	 al 	 	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	of	a	woman	's	body	;	it	's	half	a	woman	's	body	.	and	she	 walk 	 ed 	 	through	the	rift	 val 	 ley 	 	,	and	she	had	vagina	and	vagina	 re 	 placement 	 	 part 	 s 	 	where	she	would	teach	 girl 	 s 	 	and	 parent 	 s 	 	and	 boy 	 s 	 	and	 girl 	 s 	 	what	a	 health 	 y 	 	vagina	 look 	 s 	 	like	,	and	what	a	 mutilate 	 d 	 	vagina	 look 	 s 	 	like	.	and	in	the	course	of	her	travel	she	 walk 	 ed 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	for	eight	 year 	 s 	 	through	the	rift	 val 	 ley 	 	,	through	dust	,	through	 sleep 	 ing 	 	on	the	ground	--	 be 	 cause 	 	the	masais	are	 nomad 	 s 	 	,	and	she	would	 liter 	 ally 	 	have	to	find	them	,	and	they	would	move	,	and	she	would	find	them	 aga 	 in 	 	.	she	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	1,500	 girl 	 s 	 	from	 be 	 ing 	 	cut	.
and	in	that	time	she	 create 	 d 	 	an	 alter 	 native 	 	ritual	which	 involve 	 d 	 	 girl 	 s 	 	coming	of	age	 with 	 out 	 	the	cut	.
when	we	met	her	three	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	could	v	-	day	do	for	you	?	``
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	if	you	got	me	a	jeep	,	i	could	get	around	a	lot	 fast 	 er 	 	.	``
so	we	 b 	 ought 	 	her	a	jeep	.	and	in	the	year	that	she	had	the	jeep	,	she	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	4,500	 girl 	 s 	 	from	 be 	 ing 	 	cut	.	so	then	we	 s 	 aid 	 	to	her	,	``	agnes	,	well	,	what	else	could	we	do	for	you	?	``	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	eve	,	you	know	,	if	you	 g 	 ave 	 	me	some	money	,	i	could	open	a	house	and	 girl 	 s 	 	could	run	away	and	they	could	be	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	.	``
and	i	want	to	tell	 th 	 is 	 	little	story	about	my	own	 begin 	 ning 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 inter 	 related 	 	to	happiness	and	agnes	.
when	i	was	a	little	girl	--	and	i	grew	up	in	a	 wealth 	 y 	 	community	;	it	was	an	upper	-	middle	class	white	community	,	and	it	had	all	the	 trapping 	 s 	 	and	the	 look 	 s 	 	of	a	 perfect 	 ly 	 	nice	,	 wonder 	 ful 	 	,	great	life	.
and	 every 	 one 	 	was	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	happy	in	that	community	and	,	in	fact	,	my	life	was	hell	.	i	lived	with	an	 alcohol 	 ic 	 	father	who	beat	me	and	 mole 	 s 	 ted 	 	me	,	and	it	was	all	 in 	 side 	 	that	.
and	 al 	 ways 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	child	i	had	 th 	 is 	 	 fanta 	 s 	 y 	 	that	 some 	 body 	 	would	come	and	 rescu 	 e 	 	me	.
and	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	made	up	a	little	character	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	name	was	mr.	 all 	 igator 	 	,	and	i	would	call	him	up	when	 thing 	 s 	 	got	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	,	and	i	would	say	it	was	time	to	come	and	pick	me	up	.
and	i	would	go	and	pack	a	little	bag	and	i	would	wait	for	mr.	 all 	 igator 	 	to	come	.
now	,	mr.	 all 	 igator 	 	never	did	come	,	but	the	idea	of	mr.	 all 	 igator 	 	coming	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	my	 sanit 	 y 	 	and	made	it	ok	for	me	to	keep	going	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 believ 	 ed 	 	,	in	the	distance	,	there	would	be	 some 	 one 	 	coming	to	 rescu 	 e 	 	me	.
cut	to	40	-	some	-	odd	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	we	go	to	kenya	,	and	we	're	 walk 	 ing 	 	,	we	 arriv 	 e 	 	at	the	 open 	 ing 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	house	--	and	agnes	had	n't	let	me	come	to	the	house	for	 day 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 pre 	 par 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	whole	ritual	.
and	i	want	to	tell	you	a	great	story	.	when	agnes	first	 start 	 ed 	 	 fight 	 ing 	 	to	stop	female	genital	 mut 	 il 	 ation 	 	in	her	community	,	she	had	 be 	 come 	 	an	 out 	 cast 	 	,	and	she	was	 ex 	 il 	 ed 	 	and	she	was	 s 	 land 	 er 	 ed 	 	,	and	the	whole	community	 turn 	 ed 	 	against	her	.
but	,	 be 	 ing 	 	a	vagina	warrior	,	she	 ke 	 pt 	 	going	,
and	she	 ke 	 pt 	 	 commit 	 ting 	 	 her 	 self 	 	to	 transform 	 ing 	 	 conscious 	 ness 	 	.
and	in	the	masai	community	,	 goat 	 s 	 	and	 cow 	 s 	 	are	the	most	 valu 	 ed 	 	 possess 	 ion 	 	.
they	're	like	the	mercedes	-	benz	of	the	rift	 val 	 ley 	 	.
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	two	 day 	 s 	 	before	the	house	 open 	 ed 	 	,	two	different	people	 arriv 	 ed 	 	to	give	her	a	goat	each	,	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	``	i	 k 	 new 	 	then	that	female	genital	 mut 	 il 	 ation 	 	would	end	one	day	in	africa	.	``
 any 	 way 	 	,	we	 arriv 	 ed 	 	,	and	when	we	 arriv 	 ed 	 	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 girl 	 s 	 	 dress 	 ed 	 	in	red	,	 home 	 made 	 	 dress 	 es 	 	--	which	is	the	color	of	the	masai	and	the	color	of	v	-	day	--	and	they	 greet 	 ed 	 	us	,	and	they	had	made	up	these	 song 	 s 	 	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	about	the	end	of	 suffer 	 ing 	 	,	and	the	end	of	 mut 	 il 	 ation 	 	,	and	they	 walk 	 ed 	 	us	down	the	path	.
and	it	was	a	 gorge 	 ous 	 	day	in	the	african	 s 	 un 	 	,	and	the	dust	was	 fly 	 ing 	 	and	the	 girl 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 danc 	 ing 	 	,	and	there	was	 th 	 is 	 	house	,	and	it	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	v	-	day	safe	house	for	the	 girl 	 s 	 	.	``
and	it	hit	me	in	that	moment	that	it	had	taken	47	 year 	 s 	 	,	but	that	mr.	 all 	 igator 	 	had	 final 	 ly 	 	 show 	 n 	 	up	.
and	he	'd	show	up	 obvious 	 ly 	 	in	a	form	that	it	took	me	a	long	time	to	understand	,	which	is	that	when	we	give	in	the	world	what	we	want	the	most	,	we	heal	the	broken	part	 in 	 side 	 	each	of	us	.
