now	,	have	any	of	y'all	ever	 look 	 ed 	 	up	 th 	 is 	 	word	?
you	know	,	in	a	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	?	 yea 	 h 	 	,	that	's	what	i	thought	.
how	about	 th 	 is 	 	word	?
here	,	i	'll	show	it	to	you	.	lexicography	:	the	practice	of	 compil 	 ing 	 	 dict 	 ion 	 aries 	 	.
notice	--	we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	specific	--	that	word	``	 compil 	 e 	 	.	``
the	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	is	not	 carv 	 ed 	 	out	of	a	piece	of	granite	,	out	of	a	lump	of	rock	.	it	's	made	up	of	 lot 	 s 	 	of	little	bits	.
it	's	little	discrete	--	that	's	 spell 	 ed 	 	d	-	i	-	s	-	c	-	r	-	e	-	t	-	e	--	bits	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	bits	are	 word 	 s 	 	.
now	one	of	the	 perk 	 s 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 lexic 	 ographer 	 	--	 be 	 side 	 s 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	to	come	to	ted	--	is	that	you	get	to	say	 re 	 ally 	 	 f 	 un 	 	 word 	 s 	 	,	like	lexicographical	.
lexicographical	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	great	pattern	:	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	a	double	dactyl	.	and	just	by	 say 	 ing 	 	double	dactyl	,	i	've	 s 	 ent 	 	the	geek	needle	all	the	way	 in 	 to 	 	the	red	.
but	``	lexicographical	``	is	the	same	pattern	 a 	 s 	 	``	higgledy	-	piggledy	.	``
right	?	it	's	a	 f 	 un 	 	word	to	say	,	and	i	get	to	say	it	a	lot	.
now	,	one	of	the	non	-	 perk 	 s 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 lexic 	 ographer 	 	is	that	people	do	n't	 usual 	 ly 	 	have	a	kind	of	warm	,	 fuzz 	 y 	 	,	snuggly	image	of	the	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	.
right	?	 no 	 body 	 	 hug 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 dict 	 ion 	 aries 	 	.
but	what	people	 re 	 ally 	 	often	think	about	the	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	is	,	they	think	more	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
just	to	let	you	know	,	i	do	not	have	a	lexicographical	 whistl 	 e 	 	.
but	people	think	that	my	job	is	to	let	the	good	 word 	 s 	 	make	that	difficult	left	-	hand	turn	 in 	 to 	 	the	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	,	and	keep	the	bad	 word 	 s 	 	out	.
but	the	thing	is	,	i	do	n't	want	to	be	a	traffic	cop	.
for	one	thing	,	i	just	do	not	do	 uniform 	 s 	 	.
and	for	 an 	 other 	 	,	 dec 	 id 	 ing 	 	what	 word 	 s 	 	are	good	and	what	 word 	 s 	 	are	bad	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	not	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	.
and	it	's	not	 ver 	 y 	 	 f 	 un 	 	.	and	when	 part 	 s 	 	of	your	job	are	not	easy	or	 f 	 un 	 	,	you	kind	of	look	for	an	excuse	not	to	do	them	.
so	if	i	had	to	think	of	some	kind	of	occupation	 a 	 s 	 	a	metaphor	for	my	work	,	i	would	much	 ra 	 ther 	 	be	a	 fish 	 er 	 man 	 	.
i	want	to	throw	my	big	net	 in 	 to 	 	the	deep	,	blue	ocean	of	english	and	see	what	 marvel 	 ous 	 	 creature 	 s 	 	i	can	drag	up	from	the	bottom	.
but	why	do	people	want	me	to	direct	traffic	,	when	i	would	much	 ra 	 ther 	 	go	 fish 	 ing 	 	?
well	,	i	blame	the	 que 	 en 	 	.
why	do	i	blame	the	 que 	 en 	 	?
well	,	first	of	all	,	i	blame	the	 que 	 en 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	funny	.
but	 second 	 ly 	 	,	i	blame	the	 que 	 en 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 dict 	 ion 	 aries 	 	have	 re 	 ally 	 	not	 change 	 d 	 	.
our	idea	of	what	a	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	is	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 change 	 d 	 	since	her	reign	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	that	 que 	 en 	 	victoria	would	not	be	 amuse 	 d 	 	by	in	modern	 dict 	 ion 	 aries 	 	is	our	 in 	 clusion 	 	of	the	f	-	word	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	american	 dict 	 ion 	 aries 	 	since	1965	.
so	,	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	guy	,	right	?	victorian	era	.
james	murray	,	first	editor	of	the	oxford	english	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	.
i	do	not	have	that	hat	.	i	wish	i	had	that	hat	.
so	he	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	a	lot	of	what	we	consider	modern	in	 dict 	 ion 	 aries 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
when	a	guy	who	 look 	 s 	 	like	that	,	in	that	hat	,	is	the	face	of	 modern 	 ity 	 	,	you	have	a	problem	.
and	so	,	james	murray	could	get	a	job	on	any	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
there	'd	be	 virtual 	 ly 	 	no	 learn 	 ing 	 	 curv 	 e 	 	.
and	of	course	,	a	few	of	us	are	 say 	 ing 	 	:	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	 computer 	 s 	 	!
 computer 	 s 	 	!	what	about	 computer 	 s 	 	?
the	thing	about	 computer 	 s 	 	is	,	i	love	 computer 	 s 	 	.
i	mean	,	i	'm	a	huge	geek	,	i	love	 computer 	 s 	 	.
i	would	go	on	a	 hung 	 er 	 	strike	before	i	let	them	take	away	google	book	search	from	me	.
but	 computer 	 s 	 	do	n't	do	much	else	other	than	speed	up	the	process	of	 compil 	 ing 	 	 dict 	 ion 	 aries 	 	.
they	do	n't	change	the	end	result	.
 be 	 cause 	 	what	a	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	is	,	is	it	's	victorian	design	 merge 	 d 	 	with	a	little	bit	of	modern	 pro 	 pulsion 	 	.
it	's	steampunk	.	what	we	have	is	an	electric	velocipede	.
you	know	,	we	have	victorian	design	with	an	engine	on	it	.	that	's	all	!
the	design	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 change 	 d 	 	.
and	ok	,	what	about	 on 	 line 	 	 dict 	 ion 	 aries 	 	,	right	?
 on 	 line 	 	 dict 	 ion 	 aries 	 	must	be	different	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	oxford	english	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	 on 	 line 	 	,	one	of	the	best	 on 	 line 	 	 dict 	 ion 	 aries 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	word	,	by	the	way	.	erinaceous	:	pertaining	to	the	hedgehog	family	;	of	the	nature	of	a	hedgehog	.
 ver 	 y 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	word	.	so	,	look	at	that	.
 on 	 line 	 	 dict 	 ion 	 aries 	 	right	now	are	paper	 throw 	 n 	 	up	on	a	screen	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	flat	.	look	how	 man 	 y 	 	 link 	 s 	 	there	are	in	the	actual	entry	:	two	!
right	?	 t 	 hose 	 	little	 button 	 s 	 	,	i	had	them	all	 expand 	 ed 	 	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	the	date	chart	.
so	there	's	not	 ver 	 y 	 	much	going	on	here	.
there	's	not	a	lot	of	clickiness	.
and	in	fact	,	 on 	 line 	 	 dict 	 ion 	 aries 	 	replicate	 al 	 most 	 	all	the	 problem 	 s 	 	of	print	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	searchability	.
and	when	you	improve	searchability	,	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	take	away	the	one	advantage	of	print	,	which	is	 s 	 er 	 en 	 dip 	 ity 	 	.
 s 	 er 	 en 	 dip 	 ity 	 	is	when	you	find	 thing 	 s 	 	you	 we 	 re 	 	n't	looking	for	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 find 	 ing 	 	what	you	are	looking	for	is	so	 damn 	 ed 	 	difficult	.
so	--	--	now	,	when	you	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	what	we	have	here	is	a	ham	butt	problem	.
 do 	 es 	 	 every 	 one 	 	know	the	ham	butt	problem	?
woman	's	making	a	ham	for	a	big	,	family	 d 	 inner 	 	.
she	 go 	 es 	 	to	cut	the	butt	off	the	ham	and	throw	it	away	,	and	she	 look 	 s 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	piece	of	ham	and	she	's	like	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 perfect 	 ly 	 	good	piece	of	ham	.	why	am	i	 throw 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	away	?	``
she	thought	,	``	well	,	my	mom	 al 	 ways 	 	did	 th 	 is 	 	.	``
so	she	 call 	 s 	 	up	mom	,	and	she	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	mom	,	why	'd	you	cut	the	butt	off	the	ham	,	when	you	're	making	a	ham	?	``
she	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	do	n't	know	,	my	mom	 al 	 ways 	 	did	it	!	``
so	they	call	grandma	,	and	grandma	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	my	pan	was	too	small	!	``
so	,	it	's	not	that	we	have	good	 word 	 s 	 	and	bad	 word 	 s 	 	.	we	have	a	pan	that	's	too	small	!
you	know	,	that	ham	butt	is	 delic 	 ious 	 	!	there	's	no	reason	to	throw	it	away	.
the	bad	 word 	 s 	 	--	see	,	when	people	think	about	a	place	and	they	do	n't	find	a	place	on	the	map	,	they	think	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	map	 suck 	 s 	 	!	``
when	they	find	a	nightspot	or	a	bar	,	and	it	's	not	in	the	guidebook	,	they	're	like	,	``	ooh	,	 th 	 is 	 	place	must	be	cool	!	it	's	not	in	the	guidebook	.	``
when	they	find	a	word	that	's	not	in	the	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	,	they	think	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	must	be	a	bad	word	.	``	why	?	it	's	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	be	a	bad	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	.
why	are	you	 b 	 lam 	 ing 	 	the	ham	for	 be 	 ing 	 	too	big	for	the	pan	?
so	,	you	ca	n't	get	a	 small 	 er 	 	ham	.
the	english	language	is	 a 	 s 	 	big	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	.
so	,	if	you	have	a	ham	butt	problem	,	and	you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	ham	butt	problem	,	the	 con 	 clusion 	 	that	it	 lead 	 s 	 	you	to	is	 inexor 	 able 	 	and	 counter 	 intuitive 	 	:	paper	is	the	 ene 	 my 	 	of	 word 	 s 	 	.
how	can	 th 	 is 	 	be	?	i	mean	,	i	love	 book 	 s 	 	.	i	 re 	 ally 	 	love	 book 	 s 	 	.
some	of	my	best	 friend 	 s 	 	are	 book 	 s 	 	.
but	the	book	is	not	the	best	shape	for	the	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	.
now	they	're	going	to	think	``	oh	,	boy	.
people	are	going	to	take	away	my	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	paper	 dict 	 ion 	 aries 	 	?	``
no	.	there	will	still	be	paper	 dict 	 ion 	 aries 	 	.
when	we	had	 car 	 s 	 	--	when	 car 	 s 	 	 be 	 came 	 	the	 domin 	 ant 	 	mode	of	 transport 	 ation 	 	,	we	did	n't	round	up	all	the	 horse 	 s 	 	and	shoot	them	.
you	know	,	there	're	still	going	to	be	paper	 dict 	 ion 	 aries 	 	,	but	it	's	not	going	to	be	the	 domin 	 ant 	 	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	.
the	book	-	shaped	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	is	not	going	to	be	the	 on 	 ly 	 	shape	 dict 	 ion 	 aries 	 	come	in	.	and	it	's	not	going	to	be	the	prototype	for	the	 shape 	 s 	 	 dict 	 ion 	 aries 	 	come	in	.
so	,	think	about	it	 th 	 is 	 	way	:	if	you	've	got	an	artificial	constraint	,	artificial	 constraint 	 s 	 	lead	to	 arbitr 	 ary 	 	 distinct 	 ions 	 	and	a	 s 	 kew 	 ed 	 	 world 	 view 	 	.
what	if	 biologist 	 s 	 	could	 on 	 ly 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	that	made	people	go	,	``	aww	.	``	right	?
what	if	we	made	aesthetic	 judgment 	 s 	 	about	 animal 	 s 	 	,	and	 on 	 ly 	 	the	 one 	 s 	 	we	thought	 we 	 re 	 	cute	 we 	 re 	 	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	we	could	 stud 	 y 	 	?
we	'd	know	a	whole	lot	about	 charisma 	 tic 	 	 mega 	 fauna 	 	,	and	not	 ver 	 y 	 	much	about	much	else	.
and	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	problem	.
i	think	we	should	 stud 	 y 	 	all	the	 word 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	when	you	think	about	 word 	 s 	 	,	you	can	make	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 express 	 ions 	 	from	 ver 	 y 	 	humble	 part 	 s 	 	.
lexicography	is	 re 	 ally 	 	more	about	material	science	.
we	are	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	the	tolerances	of	the	 material 	 s 	 	that	you	use	to	build	the	structure	of	your	 express 	 ion 	 	:	your	 speech 	 es 	 	and	your	writing	.	and	then	,	often	people	say	to	me	,	``	well	,	ok	,	how	do	i	know	that	 th 	 is 	 	word	is	real	?	``
they	think	,	``	ok	,	if	we	think	 word 	 s 	 	are	the	 tool 	 s 	 	that	we	use	to	build	the	 express 	 ions 	 	of	our	 thought 	 s 	 	,	how	can	you	say	that	screwdrivers	are	better	than	 hammer 	 s 	 	?
how	can	you	say	that	a	sledgehammer	is	better	than	a	ball	-	peen	hammer	?	``
they	're	just	the	right	 tool 	 s 	 	for	the	job	.
and	so	people	say	to	me	,	``	how	do	i	know	if	a	word	is	real	?	``
you	know	,	 any 	 body 	 	who	's	read	a	children	's	book	 know 	 s 	 	that	love	 make 	 s 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	real	.
if	you	love	a	word	,	use	it	.	that	 make 	 s 	 	it	real	.
 be 	 ing 	 	in	the	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	is	an	artificial	 distinct 	 ion 	 	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	a	word	any	more	real	than	any	other	way	.
if	you	love	a	word	,	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	real	.
so	if	we	're	not	 worry 	 ing 	 	about	 direct 	 ing 	 	traffic	,	if	we	've	 transcend 	 ed 	 	paper	,	if	we	are	 worry 	 ing 	 	less	about	control	and	more	about	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	,	then	we	can	think	of	the	english	language	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	mobile	.
and	any	time	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	little	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	mobile	 change 	 s 	 	,	is	 touch 	 ed 	 	,	any	time	you	touch	a	word	,	you	use	it	in	a	new	 con 	 text 	 	,	you	give	it	a	new	 con 	 not 	 ation 	 	,	you	verb	it	,	you	make	the	mobile	move	.
you	did	n't	break	it	.	it	's	just	in	a	new	position	,	and	that	new	position	can	be	just	 a 	 s 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
now	,	if	you	're	no	 long 	 er 	 	a	traffic	cop	--	the	problem	with	 be 	 ing 	 	a	traffic	cop	is	there	can	 on 	 ly 	 	be	so	 man 	 y 	 	traffic	 cop 	 s 	 	in	any	one	 intersect 	 ion 	 	,	or	the	 car 	 s 	 	get	 con 	 fused 	 	.	right	?
but	if	your	goal	is	no	 long 	 er 	 	to	direct	the	traffic	,	but	 may 	 be 	 	to	count	the	 car 	 s 	 	that	go	by	,	then	more	 eye 	 ball 	 s 	 	are	better	.
you	can	ask	for	help	!
if	you	ask	for	help	,	you	get	more	 d 	 one 	 	.	and	we	 re 	 ally 	 	need	help	.
library	of	congress	:	17	million	 book 	 s 	 	,

if	 on 	 ly 	 	one	out	of	every	10	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 book 	 s 	 	had	a	word	that	's	not	in	the	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	in	it	,	that	would	be	 equi 	 valent 	 	to	more	than	two	unabridged	 dict 	 ion 	 aries 	 	.
and	i	find	an	un	-	dictionaried	word	--	a	word	like	``	un	-	dictionaried	,	``	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	--	in	 al 	 most 	 	every	book	i	read	.	what	about	 news 	 paper 	 s 	 	?

that	's	500,000	more	 word 	 s 	 	.	so	that	's	a	lot	.
and	i	'm	not	even	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 magazine 	 s 	 	.	i	'm	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 blog 	 s 	 	--	and	i	find	more	new	 word 	 s 	 	on	boingboing	in	a	 give 	 n 	 	week	than	i	do	newsweek	or	time	.
there	's	a	lot	going	on	there	.
and	i	'm	not	even	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	polysemy	,	which	is	the	 greed 	 y 	 	habit	some	 word 	 s 	 	have	of	taking	so	if	you	think	of	the	word	``	set	,	``	a	set	can	be	a	badger	's	burrow	,	a	set	can	be	one	of	the	pleats	in	an	elizabethan	ruff	,	and	there	's	one	 number 	 ed 	 	definition	in	the	oed	.

that	's	a	lexicographical	cop	out	,	to	say	,	``	 mis 	 cell 	 ane 	 ous 	 	technical	 sense 	 s 	 	.	``
so	,	we	have	all	these	 word 	 s 	 	,	and	we	 re 	 ally 	 	need	help	!
and	the	thing	is	,	we	could	ask	for	help	--	 ask 	 ing 	 	for	help	's	not	that	hard	.
i	mean	,	lexicography	is	not	rocket	science	.
see	,	i	just	 g 	 ave 	 	you	a	lot	of	 word 	 s 	 	and	a	lot	of	 number 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	more	of	a	visual	 explan 	 ation 	 	.
if	we	think	of	the	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	the	map	of	the	english	language	,	these	bright	 spot 	 s 	 	are	what	we	know	about	,	and	the	dark	 spot 	 s 	 	are	where	we	are	in	the	dark	.
if	that	was	the	map	of	all	the	 word 	 s 	 	in	american	english	,	we	do	n't	know	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
and	we	do	n't	even	know	the	shape	of	the	language	.
if	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	--	if	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	map	of	american	english	--	look	,	we	have	a	kind	of	 lump 	 y 	 	idea	of	florida	,	but	there	's	no	california	!
we	're	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	california	from	american	english	.
we	just	do	n't	know	 en 	 ough 	 	,	and	we	do	n't	even	know	that	we	're	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	california	.
we	do	n't	even	see	that	there	's	a	gap	on	the	map	.
so	 aga 	 in 	 	,	lexicography	is	not	rocket	science	.
but	even	if	it	 we 	 re 	 	,	rocket	science	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	by	 dedicate 	 d 	 	 amateur 	 s 	 	these	 day 	 s 	 	.	you	know	?
it	ca	n't	be	that	hard	to	find	some	 word 	 s 	 	!
so	,	 en 	 ough 	 	 scientist 	 s 	 	in	other	 discipline 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	people	to	help	,	and	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	a	good	job	of	it	.

and	then	,	 ornitho 	 logists 	 	can	go	and	help	track	 population 	 s 	 	,	 migr 	 ations 	 	,	etc	.
and	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	guy	,	 mi 	 ke 	 	oates	.	 mi 	 ke 	 	oates	 live 	 s 	 	in	the	u.k	.
he	's	a	director	of	an	electroplating	company	.
he	's	found	more	than	140	 come 	 ts 	 	.
he	's	found	so	 man 	 y 	 	 come 	 ts 	 	,	they	named	a	 com 	 et 	 	after	him	.
it	's	kind	of	out	past	mars	.	it	's	a	 hik 	 e 	 	.
i	do	n't	think	he	's	 get 	 ting 	 	his	picture	taken	there	 any 	 time 	 	soon	.
but	he	found	140	 come 	 ts 	 	 with 	 out 	 	a	 tele 	 scope 	 	.
he	 download 	 ed 	 	data	from	the	nasa	soho	satellite	,	and	that	's	how	he	found	them	.
if	we	can	find	 come 	 ts 	 	 with 	 out 	 	a	 tele 	 scope 	 	,	should	n't	we	be	able	to	find	 word 	 s 	 	?
now	,	y'all	know	where	i	'm	going	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	going	to	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	which	is	where	 every 	 body 	 	 go 	 es 	 	.
and	the	 inter 	 net 	 	is	great	for	 collect 	 ing 	 	 word 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 inter 	 net 	 	's	full	of	 collect 	 ors 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	little	-	known	 techno 	 logical 	 	fact	about	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	but	the	 inter 	 net 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	made	up	of	 word 	 s 	 	and	 ent 	 husiasm 	 	.
and	 word 	 s 	 	and	 ent 	 husiasm 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	happen	to	be	the	recipe	for	lexicography	.	is	n't	that	great	?
so	there	are	a	lot	of	 re 	 ally 	 	good	word	-	 collect 	 ing 	 	 s 	 ites 	 	out	there	right	now	,	but	the	problem	with	some	of	them	is	that	they	're	not	scientific	 en 	 ough 	 	.
they	show	the	word	,	but	they	do	n't	show	any	 con 	 text 	 	.	where	did	it	come	from	?	who	 s 	 aid 	 	it	?
what	 news 	 paper 	 	was	it	in	?	what	book	?
 be 	 cause 	 	a	word	is	like	an	 archaeo 	 logical 	 	artifact	.
if	you	do	n't	know	the	 proven 	 ance 	 	or	the	source	of	the	artifact	,	it	's	not	science	,	it	's	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	thing	to	look	at	.
so	a	word	 with 	 out 	 	 it 	 s 	 	source	is	like	a	cut	flower	.
you	know	,	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	to	look	at	for	a	while	,	but	then	it	dies	.
it	dies	too	fast	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	whole	time	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	the	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	,	the	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	,	the	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	,	the	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	.	``
not	``	a	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	,	``	or	``	 dict 	 ion 	 aries 	 	.	``	and	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	,	well	,	people	use	the	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	to	stand	for	the	whole	language	.
they	use	it	 syn 	 ec 	 do 	 ch 	 ically 	 	.	and	one	of	the	 problem 	 s 	 	of	 know 	 ing 	 	a	word	like	``	 syn 	 ec 	 do 	 ch 	 ically 	 	``	is	that	you	 re 	 ally 	 	want	an	excuse	to	say	``	 syn 	 ec 	 do 	 ch 	 ically 	 	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	whole	talk	 ha 	 s 	 	just	 be 	 en 	 	an	excuse	to	get	me	to	the	point	where	i	could	say	``	 syn 	 ec 	 do 	 ch 	 ically 	 	``	to	all	of	you	.
so	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	sorry	.	but	when	you	use	a	part	of	 some 	 thing 	 	--	like	the	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	is	a	part	of	the	language	,	or	a	flag	 stand 	 s 	 	for	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	it	's	a	symbol	of	the	country	--	then	you	're	using	it	 syn 	 ec 	 do 	 ch 	 ically 	 	.
but	the	thing	is	,	we	could	make	the	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	the	whole	language	.
if	we	get	a	 big 	 ger 	 	pan	,	then	we	can	put	all	the	 word 	 s 	 	in	.
we	can	put	in	all	the	 meaning 	 s 	 	.
 do 	 es 	 	n't	 every 	 one 	 	want	more	meaning	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	?
and	we	can	make	the	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	not	just	be	a	symbol	of	the	language	--	we	can	make	it	be	the	whole	language	.
you	see	,	what	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 hop 	 ing 	 	for	is	that	my	son	,	who	 turn 	 s 	 	seven	 th 	 is 	 	month	--	i	want	him	to	 bare 	 ly 	 	remember	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	form	factor	that	 dict 	 ion 	 aries 	 	used	to	come	in	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 dict 	 ion 	 aries 	 	used	to	look	like	.
i	want	him	to	think	of	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	eight	-	track	tape	.
it	's	a	format	that	 di 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	n't	 use 	 ful 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	.
it	was	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	what	people	 need 	 ed 	 	.
and	the	thing	is	,	if	we	can	put	in	all	the	 word 	 s 	 	,	no	 long 	 er 	 	have	that	artificial	 distinct 	 ion 	 	between	good	and	bad	,	we	can	 re 	 ally 	 	 de 	 scribe 	 	the	language	like	 scientist 	 s 	 	.
we	can	 leav 	 e 	 	the	aesthetic	 judgment 	 s 	 	to	the	 writer 	 s 	 	and	the	 speaker 	 s 	 	.
if	we	can	do	that	,	then	i	can	 s 	 pend 	 	all	my	time	 fish 	 ing 	 	,	and	i	do	n't	have	to	be	a	traffic	cop	 any 	 more 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	for	your	kind	attention	.
