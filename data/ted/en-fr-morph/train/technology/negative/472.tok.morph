i	was	raised	in	seoul	,	korea	,	and	 move 	 d 	 	to	new	york	city	in	1999	to	attend	college	.
i	was	pre	-	med	at	the	time	,	and	i	thought	i	would	 be 	 come 	 	a	surgeon	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	anatomy	and	 dissect 	 ing 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 p 	 ique 	 d 	 	my	curiosity	.
at	the	same	time	,	i	fell	in	love	with	new	york	city	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	i	could	look	at	the	whole	city	 a 	 s 	 	a	living	organism	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	dissect	it	and	look	 in 	 to 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 un 	 s 	 een 	 	 layer 	 s 	 	.
and	the	way	to	it	,	for	me	,	was	through	 art 	 istic 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	.
so	,	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	pursue	an	mfa	 in 	 stead 	 	of	an	m.d	.
and	in	grad	school	i	 be 	 came 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 creature 	 s 	 	that	 d 	 well 	 	in	the	 hid 	 den 	 	 corner 	 s 	 	of	the	city	.
in	new	york	city	,	 rat 	 s 	 	are	part	of	 commute 	 rs 	 	'	 dai 	 ly 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
most	people	 ignor 	 e 	 	them	or	are	 frighten 	 ed 	 	of	them	.
but	i	took	a	 lik 	 ing 	 	to	them	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 d 	 well 	 	on	the	 fringe 	 s 	 	of	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
and	even	 th 	 ough 	 	they	're	used	in	 lab 	 s 	 	to	promote	human	 live 	 s 	 	,	they	're	 al 	 so 	 	 consider 	 ed 	 	 pest 	 s 	 	.
i	 al 	 so 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	looking	around	in	the	city	and	 try 	 ing 	 	to	photograph	them	.
one	day	,	in	the	 sub 	 way 	 	,	i	was	 snap 	 ping 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	of	the	 track 	 s 	 	 hop 	 ing 	 	to	catch	a	rat	or	two	,	and	a	man	came	up	to	me	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	ca	n't	take	 photograph 	 s 	 	here	.
the	mta	will	 confisc 	 ate 	 	your	camera	.	``
i	was	 quit 	 e 	 	 shock 	 ed 	 	by	that	,	and	thought	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	``	well	,	ok	then	.
i	'll	follow	the	 rat 	 s 	 	.	``
then	i	 start 	 ed 	 	going	 in 	 to 	 	the	 tunnel 	 s 	 	,	which	made	me	 real 	 ize 	 	that	there	's	a	whole	new	dimension	to	the	city	that	i	never	saw	before	and	most	people	do	n't	get	to	see	.
around	the	same	time	,	i	met	like	-	minded	 individual 	 s 	 	who	call	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	urban	 explore 	 rs 	 	,	 adventure 	 rs 	 	,	 spelunk 	 ers 	 	,	guerrilla	 historian 	 s 	 	,	etc	.
i	was	 welcome 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	loose	,	 inter 	 net 	 	-	based	network	of	people	who	 regular 	 ly 	 	explore	urban	 ruin 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 abandon 	 ed 	 	 sub 	 way 	 	 station 	 s 	 	,	 tunnel 	 s 	 	,	 sew 	 ers 	 	,	 a 	 que 	 duct 	 s 	 	,	 factor 	 ies 	 	,	 hospital 	 s 	 	,	 ship 	 yard 	 s 	 	and	so	on	.
when	i	took	 photograph 	 s 	 	in	these	 location 	 s 	 	,	i	felt	there	was	 some 	 thing 	 	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	in	the	 picture 	 s 	 	.
 simpl 	 y 	 	 document 	 ing 	 	these	soon	-	to	-	be	-	 demolish 	 ed 	 	 structure 	 s 	 	was	n't	 en 	 ough 	 	for	me	.
so	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	create	a	 fiction 	 al 	 	character	or	an	animal	that	 d 	 well 	 s 	 	in	these	 under 	 ground 	 	 space 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 simpl 	 est 	 	way	to	do	it	,	at	the	time	,	was	to	model	 my 	 self 	 	.
i	 decide 	 d 	 	against	 cloth 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 want 	 ed 	 	the	figure	to	be	 with 	 out 	 	any	cultural	 implic 	 ations 	 	or	time	-	specific	 element 	 s 	 	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	a	simple	way	to	represent	a	living	body	 inhabit 	 ing 	 	these	 decay 	 ing 	 	,	 der 	 elict 	 	 space 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	taken	in	the	riviera	sugar	 factor 	 y 	 	in	red	hook	,	brooklyn	.
it	's	now	an	empty	,	six	-	acre	lot	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	a	 shop 	 ping 	 	mall	right	 a 	 cross 	 	from	the	new	ikea	.
i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	fond	of	 th 	 is 	 	space	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	the	first	massive	industrial	complex	i	found	on	my	own	that	is	 abandon 	 ed 	 	.
when	i	first	went	in	,	i	was	 scar 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	heard	 dog 	 s 	 	 bark 	 ing 	 	and	i	thought	they	 we 	 re 	 	guard	 dog 	 s 	 	.
but	they	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	be	wild	 dog 	 s 	 	living	there	,	and	it	was	right	by	the	water	,	so	there	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 wan 	 s 	 	and	 duck 	 s 	 	 swimm 	 ing 	 	around	and	 tree 	 s 	 	growing	 every 	 where 	 	and	bees	 nest 	 ing 	 	in	the	sugar	 barrel 	 s 	 	.
the	nature	had	 re 	 ally 	 	 re 	 claim 	 ed 	 	the	whole	complex	.
and	,	in	a	way	,	i	 want 	 ed 	 	the	human	figure	in	the	picture	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	part	of	that	nature	.
when	i	got	 comfort 	 able 	 	in	the	space	,	it	 al 	 so 	 	felt	like	a	big	 play 	 ground 	 	.
i	would	climb	up	the	 tank 	 s 	 	and	hop	 a 	 cross 	 	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	 beam 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	if	i	went	back	in	time	and	 be 	 came 	 	a	child	 aga 	 in 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	taken	in	the	old	croton	aqueduct	,	which	 suppli 	 ed 	 	fresh	water	to	new	york	city	for	the	first	time	.
the	construction	 beg 	 an 	 	in	1837	.
it	 last 	 ed 	 	about	five	 year 	 s 	 	.
it	got	 abandon 	 ed 	 	when	the	new	croton	 a 	 que 	 duct 	 s 	 	 open 	 ed 	 	in	1890	.
when	you	go	 in 	 to 	 	 space 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	're	 direct 	 ly 	 	 access 	 ing 	 	the	past	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 s 	 it 	 	 un 	 touch 	 ed 	 	for	 decade 	 s 	 	.
i	love	 feel 	 ing 	 	the	aura	of	a	space	that	 ha 	 s 	 	so	much	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	looking	at	 re 	 production 	 s 	 	of	it	at	home	,	you	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	the	hand	-	laid	 brick 	 s 	 	and	 shimmy 	 ing 	 	up	and	down	narrow	 crack 	 s 	 	and	 get 	 ting 	 	wet	and	 mud 	 dy 	 	and	 walk 	 ing 	 	in	a	dark	tunnel	with	a	 flash 	 light 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	tunnel	 under 	 neath 	 	 river 	 side 	 	park	.
it	was	built	in	the	1930s	by	robert	moses	.
the	 mural 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 d 	 one 	 	by	a	graffiti	artist	to	 commemo 	 rate 	 	the	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 home 	 less 	 	people	that	got	 re 	 locate 	 d 	 	from	the	tunnel	in	1991	when	the	tunnel	 re 	 open 	 ed 	 	for	 train 	 s 	 	.
 walk 	 ing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	tunnel	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 peace 	 ful 	 	.
there	's	 no 	 body 	 	around	you	,	and	you	hear	the	 kid 	 s 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	in	the	park	above	you	,	 complete 	 ly 	 	 un 	 aware 	 	of	what	's	 under 	 neath 	 	.
when	i	was	going	out	a	lot	to	these	 place 	 s 	 	,	i	was	 feel 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	 anxie 	 ty 	 	and	 isol 	 ation 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	in	a	 so 	 lit 	 ary 	 	phase	in	my	life	,	and	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	title	my	 s 	 eries 	 	``	naked	city	 s 	 ple 	 en 	 	,	``	which	 re 	 ference 	 s 	 	charles	baudelaire	.
``	naked	city	``	is	a	 nick 	 name 	 	for	new	york	,	and	``	 s 	 ple 	 en 	 	``	 embodi 	 es 	 	the	 melanc 	 holi 	 a 	 	and	 in 	 ertia 	 	that	come	from	 feel 	 ing 	 	 alien 	 ated 	 	in	an	urban	environment	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	same	tunnel	.
you	see	the	 s 	 un 	 beam 	 s 	 	coming	from	the	 ventil 	 ation 	 	 duct 	 s 	 	and	the	train	 approach 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	tunnel	that	's	 abandon 	 ed 	 	in	hell	's	kitchen	.
i	was	there	 al 	 one 	 	,	setting	up	,	and	a	 home 	 less 	 	man	 approach 	 ed 	 	.
i	was	 bas 	 ically 	 	 intrud 	 ing 	 	in	his	living	space	.
i	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 frighten 	 ed 	 	at	first	,	but	i	 calm 	 ly 	 	 explain 	 ed 	 	to	him	that	i	was	 work 	 ing 	 	on	an	art	project	and	he	did	n't	seem	to	mind	and	so	i	went	 a 	 head 	 	and	put	my	camera	on	self	-	timer	and	ran	back	and	forth	.
and	when	i	was	 d 	 one 	 	,	he	 actual 	 ly 	 	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	me	his	shirt	to	wipe	off	my	feet	and	 kind 	 ly 	 	 walk 	 ed 	 	me	out	.
it	must	have	 be 	 en 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 usual 	 	day	for	him	.
one	thing	that	 s 	 truck 	 	me	,	after	 th 	 is 	 	incident	,	was	that	a	space	like	that	 hold 	 s 	 	so	 man 	 y 	 	 delet 	 ed 	 	 memor 	 ies 	 	of	the	city	.
that	 home 	 less 	 	man	,	to	me	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 represent 	 ed 	 	an	element	of	the	 un 	 conscious 	 	of	the	city	.
he	told	me	that	he	was	 abuse 	 d 	 	above	ground	and	was	once	in	riker	's	 is 	 land 	 	,	and	at	last	he	found	peace	and	quiet	in	that	space	.
the	tunnel	was	once	built	for	the	 prosper 	 ity 	 	of	the	city	,	but	is	now	a	 sanct 	 uary 	 	for	 out 	 cast 	 s 	 	,	who	are	 complete 	 ly 	 	 for 	 gotten 	 	in	the	average	urban	 d 	 well 	 er 	 	's	 every 	 day 	 	life	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 under 	 neath 	 	my	 al 	 ma 	 	 mat 	 er 	 	,	columbia	university	.
the	 tunnel 	 s 	 	are	famous	for	 hav 	 ing 	 	 be 	 en 	 	used	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	 develop 	 ment 	 	of	the	manhattan	project	.
 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	tunnel	is	 interest 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 show 	 s 	 	the	original	 found 	 ations 	 	of	bloomingdale	 insan 	 e 	 	asylum	,	which	was	 demolish 	 ed 	 	in	1890	when	columbia	 move 	 d 	 	in	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	new	york	city	farm	 colon 	 y 	 	,	which	was	a	 poor 	 house 	 	in	staten	 is 	 land 	 	from	the	1890s	to	the	1930s	.
most	of	my	 photo 	 s 	 	are	set	in	 place 	 s 	 	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	 abandon 	 ed 	 	for	 decade 	 s 	 	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	exception	.
 th 	 is 	 	children	's	hospital	was	closed	in	1997	;	it	's	 locate 	 d 	 	in	newark	.
when	i	was	there	three	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	the	 window 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	broken	and	the	 wall 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 peel 	 ing 	 	,	but	 every 	 thing 	 	was	left	there	 a 	 s 	 	it	was	.
you	see	the	 au 	 topsy 	 	table	,	morgue	 tray 	 s 	 	,	x	-	ray	 machine 	 s 	 	and	even	used	 utensil 	 s 	 	,	which	you	see	on	the	 au 	 topsy 	 	table	.
after	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	-	 abandon 	 ed 	 	 building 	 s 	 	,	i	felt	that	 every 	 thing 	 	could	fall	 in 	 to 	 	 ruin 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	fast	:	your	home	,	your	 off 	 ice 	 	,	a	 shop 	 ping 	 	mall	,	a	church	--
any	man	-	made	 structure 	 s 	 	around	you	.
i	was	 re 	 minded 	 	of	how	fragile	our	sense	of	security	is	and	how	 vulner 	 able 	 	people	 tru 	 ly 	 	are	.
i	love	to	travel	,	and	berlin	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	one	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	cities	.
it	's	full	of	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	full	of	 under 	 ground 	 	 bunk 	 ers 	 	and	 ruin 	 s 	 	from	the	war	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	taken	under	a	 home 	 less 	 	asylum	built	in	1885	to	house	1,100	people	.
i	saw	the	structure	while	i	was	on	the	train	,	and	i	got	off	at	the	next	station	and	met	people	there	that	 g 	 ave 	 	me	access	to	 the 	 ir 	 	catacomb	-	like	 base 	 ment 	 	,
which	was	used	for	 am 	 mun 	 ition 	 	 s 	 to 	 rage 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	war	and	 al 	 so 	 	,	at	some	point	,	to	hide	 group 	 s 	 	of	jewish	 refuge 	 es 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	actual	 cata 	 comb 	 s 	 	in	paris	.
i	 explore 	 d 	 	there	 extens 	 ively 	 	in	the	off	-	 limit 	 s 	 	 area 	 s 	 	and	fell	in	love	right	away	.
there	are	more	than	185	 mile 	 s 	 	of	 tunnel 	 s 	 	,	and	 on 	 ly 	 	about	a	mile	is	open	to	the	public	 a 	 s 	 	a	museum	.
the	first	 tunnel 	 s 	 	date	back	to	60	b.c	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 consist 	 ent 	 ly 	 	 d 	 ug 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 lime 	 stone 	 	 quar 	 ries 	 	and	by	the	18th	century	,	the	caving	-	in	of	some	of	these	 quar 	 ries 	 	posed	 safe 	 ty 	 	 threat 	 s 	 	,	so	the	government	 order 	 ed 	 	 re 	 in 	 forcing 	 	of	the	 exist 	 ing 	 	 quar 	 ries 	 	and	 d 	 ug 	 	new	 observ 	 ation 	 	 tunnel 	 s 	 	in	order	to	monitor	and	map	the	whole	place	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	the	system	is	 ver 	 y 	 	complex	and	vast	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	to	get	lost	in	there	.
and	at	the	same	time	,	there	was	a	problem	in	the	city	with	 over 	 flow 	 ing 	 	 cemet 	 eries 	 	.
so	the	 bone 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 move 	 d 	 	from	the	 cemet 	 eries 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 quar 	 ries 	 	,	making	them	 in 	 to 	 	the	 cata 	 comb 	 s 	 	.
the	 remain 	 s 	 	of	over	six	million	people	are	 house 	 d 	 	in	there	,	some	over	1,300	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	taken	under	the	montparnasse	 cemet 	 ery 	 	where	most	of	the	 os 	 su 	 aries 	 	are	 locate 	 d 	 	.	there	are	 al 	 so 	 	phone	 cable 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	used	in	the	'50s	and	 man 	 y 	 	 bunk 	 ers 	 	from	the	world	war	ii	era	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	german	 bunk 	 er 	 	.
 near 	 by 	 	there	's	a	french	 bunk 	 er 	 	,	and	the	whole	tunnel	system	is	so	complex	that	the	two	 part 	 ies 	 	never	met	.
the	 tunnel 	 s 	 	are	famous	for	 hav 	 ing 	 	 be 	 en 	 	used	by	the	 resist 	 ance 	 	,	which	victor	hugo	wrote	about	in	``	les	miserables	.	``
and	i	saw	a	lot	of	graffiti	from	the	1800s	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
after	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	the	 under 	 ground 	 	of	paris	,	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	climb	up	,	and	i	 climb 	 ed 	 	a	 got 	 hic 	 	monument	that	's	right	in	the	middle	of	paris	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	tower	of	saint	jacques	.
it	was	built	in	the	early	1500s	.
i	do	n't	recommend	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	on	a	gargoyle	in	the	middle	of	january	,	naked	.
it	was	not	 ver 	 y 	 	 comfort 	 able 	 	.
and	all	 th 	 is 	 	time	,	i	never	saw	a	single	rat	in	any	of	these	 place 	 s 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	when	i	was	in	the	london	 sew 	 ers 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	 tough 	 est 	 	place	to	explore	.
i	had	to	wear	a	gas	mask	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	toxic	 fum 	 es 	 	--	i	guess	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	in	 th 	 is 	 	picture	.
and	when	the	 tide 	 s 	 	of	waste	matter	come	in	it	 sound 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	if	a	whole	storm	is	 approach 	 ing 	 	you	.

and	the	16mm	black	-	and	-	white	film	 g 	 ave 	 	a	different	feel	to	it	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	theater	project	i	 work 	 ed 	 	on	.

the	last	place	i	 visit 	 ed 	 	was	the	mayan	 ruin 	 s 	 	of	copan	,	honduras	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	taken	 in 	 side 	 	an	 archaeo 	 logical 	 	tunnel	in	the	main	temple	.
i	like	 do 	 ing 	 	more	than	just	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	these	 space 	 s 	 	.
i	feel	an	 oblig 	 ation 	 	to	animate	and	 human 	 ize 	 	these	 space 	 s 	 	 continu 	 ally 	 	in	order	to	preserve	 the 	 ir 	 	 memor 	 ies 	 	in	a	creative	way	--	before	they	're	lost	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
