ten	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	on	a	tuesday	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	i	 conduct 	 ed 	 	a	 parachut 	 e 	 	jump	at	fort	bragg	,	north	carolina	.
it	was	a	routine	training	jump	,	like	 man 	 y 	 	more	i	'd	 d 	 one 	 	since	i	 be 	 came 	 	a	 para 	 troop 	 er 	 	27	 year 	 s 	 	before	.
we	went	down	to	the	 air 	 field 	 	early	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 arm 	 y 	 	and	you	 al 	 ways 	 	go	early	.
you	do	some	routine	 re 	 fresh 	 er 	 	training	,	and	then	you	go	to	put	on	your	 parachut 	 e 	 	and	a	 bud 	 dy 	 	 help 	 s 	 	you	.
and	you	put	on	the	t	-	10	 parachut 	 e 	 	.
and	you	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 care 	 ful 	 	how	you	put	the	 s 	 trap 	 s 	 	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	the	leg	 s 	 trap 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	go	between	your	 leg 	 s 	 	.
and	then	you	put	on	your	 re 	 serve 	 	,	and	then	you	put	on	your	heavy	 ruck 	 s 	 ack 	 	.
and	then	a	 jump 	 master 	 	 come 	 s 	 	,	and	he	's	an	 experience 	 d 	 	nco	in	 parachut 	 e 	 	 operation 	 s 	 	.
he	 check 	 s 	 	you	out	,	he	 grab 	 s 	 	your	 adjust 	 ing 	 	 s 	 trap 	 s 	 	and	he	 tight 	 en 	 s 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	so	that	your	chest	is	 crush 	 ed 	 	,	your	 shoulder 	 s 	 	are	 crush 	 ed 	 	down	,	and	,	of	course	,	he	's	 tight 	 ened 	 	so	your	voice	 go 	 es 	 	up	a	couple	 octave 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
then	you	 s 	 it 	 	down	,	and	you	wait	a	little	while	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 arm 	 y 	 	.
then	you	load	the	 air 	 craft 	 	,	and	then	you	stand	up	and	you	get	on	,	and	you	kind	of	lumber	to	the	 air 	 craft 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	in	a	line	of	people	,	and	you	 s 	 it 	 	down	on	canvas	 seat 	 s 	 	on	either	side	of	the	 air 	 craft 	 	.
and	you	wait	a	little	bit	 long 	 er 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	air	force	 teach 	 ing 	 	the	 arm 	 y 	 	how	to	wait	.
then	you	take	off	.
and	it	's	 pain 	 ful 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	now	--	and	i	think	it	's	designed	 th 	 is 	 	way	--	it	's	 pain 	 ful 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	so	you	want	to	jump	.
you	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	jump	,	but	you	want	out	.
so	you	get	in	the	 air 	 craft 	 	,	you	're	 fly 	 ing 	 	 a 	 long 	 	,	and	at	20	 minute 	 s 	 	out	,	these	 jump 	 master 	 s 	 	start	giving	you	 command 	 s 	 	.
they	give	20	 minute 	 s 	 	--	that	's	a	time	 war 	 ning 	 	.
you	 s 	 it 	 	there	,	ok	.
then	they	give	you	10	 minute 	 s 	 	.
and	of	course	,	you	're	 respond 	 ing 	 	with	all	of	these	.
and	that	's	to	boost	 every 	 body 	 	's	confidence	,	to	show	that	you	're	not	 scar 	 ed 	 	.
then	they	give	you	,	``	get	ready	.	``
then	they	go	,	``	 out 	 board 	 	 person 	 nel 	 	,	stand	up	.	``
if	you	're	an	 out 	 board 	 	 person 	 nel 	 	,	now	you	stand	up	.
if	you	're	an	 in 	 board 	 	 person 	 nel 	 	,	stand	up	.
and	then	you	hook	up	,	and	you	hook	up	your	static	line	.
and	at	that	point	,	you	think	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	guess	what	?
i	'm	 prob 	 ably 	 	going	to	jump	.
there	's	no	way	to	get	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	.	``	you	go	through	some	 add 	 ition 	 al 	 	 check 	 s 	 	,	and	then	they	open	the	door	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	that	tuesday	 morn 	 ing 	 	in	september	,	and	it	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	nice	 out 	 side 	 	.
so	nice	air	 come 	 s 	 	 flow 	 ing 	 	in	.
the	 jump 	 master 	 s 	 	start	to	check	the	door	.
and	then	when	it	's	time	to	go	,	a	green	light	 go 	 es 	 	and	the	 jump 	 master 	 	 go 	 es 	 	,	``	go	.	``
the	first	guy	 go 	 es 	 	,	and	you	're	just	in	line	,	and	you	just	kind	of	lumber	to	the	door	.
jump	is	a	misnomer	;	you	fall	.
you	fall	 out 	 side 	 	the	door	,	you	're	caught	in	the	 slip 	 stream 	 	.
the	first	thing	you	do	is	lock	 in 	 to 	 	a	tight	body	position	--	head	down	in	your	chest	,	your	 arm 	 s 	 	 extend 	 ed 	 	,	put	over	your	 re 	 serve 	 	 parachut 	 e 	 	.
you	do	that	 be 	 cause 	 	,	27	 year 	 s 	 	before	,	an	 air 	 borne 	 	 s 	 er 	 ge 	 ant 	 	had	taught	me	to	do	that	.
i	have	no	idea	 whet 	 her 	 	it	 make 	 s 	 	any	 differ 	 ence 	 	,	but	he	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	make	sense	,	and	i	was	n't	going	to	test	the	 hypo 	 thesis 	 	that	he	'd	be	wrong	.
and	then	you	wait	for	the	 open 	 ing 	 	shock	for	your	 parachut 	 e 	 	to	open	.
if	you	do	n't	get	an	 open 	 ing 	 	shock	,	you	do	n't	get	a	 parachut 	 e 	 	--	you	've	got	a	whole	new	problem	set	.
but	 typical 	 ly 	 	you	do	;	 typical 	 ly 	 	it	 open 	 s 	 	.
and	of	course	,	if	your	leg	 s 	 trap 	 s 	 	are	n't	set	right	,	at	that	point	you	get	 an 	 other 	 	little	thrill	.
boom	.
so	then	you	look	around	,	you	're	under	a	 can 	 opy 	 	and	you	say	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	good	.	``
now	you	 prep 	 are 	 	for	the	 inevit 	 able 	 	.
you	are	going	to	hit	the	ground	.
you	ca	n't	delay	that	much	.
and	you	 re 	 ally 	 	ca	n't	decide	where	you	hit	 ver 	 y 	 	much	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	pretend	you	can	steer	,	but	you	're	 be 	 ing 	 	 deliver 	 ed 	 	.
so	you	look	around	,	where	you	're	going	to	land	,	you	try	to	make	 your 	 self 	 	ready	.
and	then	 a 	 s 	 	you	get	close	,	you	lower	your	 ruck 	 s 	 ack 	 	 be 	 low 	 	you	on	a	 lower 	 ing 	 	line	,	so	that	it	's	not	on	you	when	you	land	,
and	you	 prep 	 are 	 	to	do	a	 parachut 	 e 	 	-	 land 	 ing 	 	fall	.
now	the	 arm 	 y 	 	 teach 	 es 	 	you	to	do	five	 point 	 s 	 	of	performance	--	the	 to 	 es 	 	of	your	feet	,	your	 calve 	 s 	 	,	your	 t 	 high 	 s 	 	,	your	 buttock 	 s 	 	and	your	push	-	up	 muscle 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 th 	 is 	 	elegant	little	land	,	twist	and	roll	.
and	that	's	not	going	to	hurt	.
in	30	-	some	 year 	 s 	 	of	 jump 	 ing 	 	,	i	never	did	one	.
i	 al 	 ways 	 	 land 	 ed 	 	like	a	 water 	 mel 	 on 	 	out	of	a	third	floor	window	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	i	hit	,	the	first	thing	i	did	is	i	'd	see	if	i	'd	broken	 any 	 thing 	 	that	i	 need 	 ed 	 	.
i	'd	shake	my	head	,	and	i	'd	ask	 my 	 self 	 	the	 e 	 ternal 	 	question	:	``	why	did	n't	i	go	 in 	 to 	 	 bank 	 ing 	 	?	``
and	i	'd	look	around	,	and	then	i	'd	see	 an 	 other 	 	 para 	 troop 	 er 	 	,	a	young	guy	or	girl	,	and	they	'd	have	 pull 	 ed 	 	out	 the 	 ir 	 	m	4	 carb 	 ine 	 	and	they	'd	be	 pick 	 ing 	 	up	 the 	 ir 	 	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	.
they	'd	be	 do 	 ing 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	that	we	had	taught	them	.
and	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	,	if	they	had	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	combat	,	they	would	do	what	we	had	taught	them	and	they	would	follow	 lead 	 ers 	 	.
and	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	,	if	they	came	out	of	combat	,	it	would	be	 be 	 cause 	 	we	led	them	well	.
and	i	was	 hook 	 ed 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	on	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	what	i	did	.
so	now	i	do	that	tuesday	 morn 	 ing 	 	jump	,	but	it	's	not	any	jump	--	that	was	september	11th	,	2001	.
and	when	we	took	off	from	the	 air 	 field 	 	,	america	was	at	peace	.
when	we	 land 	 ed 	 	on	the	drop	-	zone	,	 every 	 thing 	 	had	 change 	 d 	 	.
and	what	we	thought	about	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	young	 soldier 	 s 	 	going	 in 	 to 	 	combat	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 theoretic 	 al 	 	was	now	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	real	--	and	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	 seem 	 ed 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
but	 thing 	 s 	 	had	 change 	 d 	 	;	i	was	a	46	-	year	-	old	brigadier	general	.
i	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	,	but	 thing 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	so	much	that	i	was	going	to	have	to	make	some	significant	 change 	 s 	 	,	and	on	that	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	i	did	n't	know	it	.
i	was	raised	with	 tradition 	 al 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	of	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	:	robert	e.	lee	,	john	buford	at	gettysburg	.
and	i	 al 	 so 	 	was	raised	with	personal	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	my	father	in	vietnam	.
and	i	was	raised	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 soldier 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	strong	and	wise	and	brave	and	 faith 	 ful 	 	;	they	did	n't	lie	,	cheat	,	steal	or	abandon	 the 	 ir 	 	 comrade 	 s 	 	.	and	i	still	 believ 	 e 	 	real	 lead 	 ers 	 	are	like	that	.
but	in	my	first	25	 year 	 s 	 	of	 care 	 er 	 	,	i	had	a	bunch	of	different	 experience 	 s 	 	.	one	of	my	first	battalion	 command 	 ers 	 	,	i	 work 	 ed 	 	in	his	battalion	for	18	 month 	 s 	 	and	the	 on 	 ly 	 	conversation	he	ever	had	with	lt.	mcchrystal	was	at	mile	18	of	a	25	-	mile	road	march	,	and	he	 chew 	 ed 	 	my	ass	for	about	40	 second 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	that	was	real	 interact 	 ion 	 	.
but	then	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	when	i	was	a	company	 command 	 er 	 	,	i	went	out	to	the	national	training	center	.
and	we	did	an	operation	,	and	my	company	did	a	dawn	attack	--	you	know	,	the	classic	dawn	attack	:	you	 prep 	 are 	 	all	night	,	move	to	the	line	of	 depart 	 ure 	 	.
and	i	had	an	 arm 	 or 	 ed 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	at	that	point	.
we	move	forward	,	and	we	get	 wipe 	 d 	 	out	--	i	mean	,	 wipe 	 d 	 	out	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	.
the	 ene 	 my 	 	did	n't	break	a	sweat	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
and	after	the	battle	,	they	 br 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	mobile	theater	and	they	do	what	they	call	an	``	after	action	review	``	to	teach	you	what	you	've	 d 	 one 	 	wrong	.
sort	of	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	by	 humil 	 iation 	 	.
they	put	a	big	screen	up	,	and	they	take	you	through	 every 	 thing 	 	:
``	and	then	you	did	n't	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	you	did	n't	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	 etc 	 . 	 	``
i	 walk 	 ed 	 	out	 feel 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	low	and	i	saw	my	battalion	 command 	 er 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	had	let	him	down	.
and	i	went	up	to	 apolog 	 ize 	 	to	him	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	stanley	,	i	thought	you	did	great	.	``
and	in	one	sentence	,	he	 lift 	 ed 	 	me	,	put	me	back	on	my	feet	,	and	taught	me	that	 lead 	 ers 	 	can	let	you	fail	and	yet	not	let	you	be	a	failure	.
when	9/11	came	,	46	-	year	-	old	brig	.	gen.	mcchrystal	 s 	 ees 	 	a	whole	new	world	.
first	,	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	obvious	,	that	you	're	familiar	with	:	the	environment	 change 	 d 	 	--	the	speed	,	the	 scru 	 tin 	 y 	 	,	the	 sensitiv 	 ity 	 	of	 every 	 thing 	 	now	is	so	fast	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	it	 evolve 	 s 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	than	people	have	time	to	 re 	 ally 	 	reflect	on	it	.
but	 every 	 thing 	 	we	do	is	in	a	different	 con 	 text 	 	.
more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	the	force	that	i	led	was	spread	over	more	than	20	 count 	 ries 	 	.
and	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	get	all	the	key	 lead 	 ers 	 	for	a	decision	together	in	a	single	room	and	look	them	in	the	eye	and	build	 the 	 ir 	 	confidence	and	get	trust	from	them	,	i	'm	now	 lead 	 ing 	 	a	force	that	's	 dispers 	 ed 	 	,	and	i	've	got	to	use	other	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	.
i	've	got	to	use	video	 tele 	 con 	 ference 	 s 	 	,	i	've	got	to	use	chat	,	i	've	got	to	use	email	,	i	've	got	to	use	phone	 call 	 s 	 	--	i	've	got	to	use	 every 	 thing 	 	i	can	,	not	just	for	communication	,	but	for	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	.
a	22	-	year	-	old	individual	 oper 	 ating 	 	 al 	 one 	 	,	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 mile 	 s 	 	from	me	,	 ha 	 s 	 	got	to	communicate	to	me	with	confidence	.
i	have	to	have	trust	in	them	and	vice	versa	.
and	i	 al 	 so 	 	have	to	build	 the 	 ir 	 	faith	.
and	that	's	a	new	kind	of	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	for	me	.
we	had	one	operation	where	we	had	to	coordinate	it	from	 multi 	 ple 	 	 location 	 s 	 	.
an	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	came	--	did	n't	have	time	to	get	 every 	 body 	 	together	.
so	we	had	to	get	complex	 intellig 	 ence 	 	together	,	we	had	to	line	up	the	ability	to	act	.
it	was	sensitive	,	we	had	to	go	up	the	chain	of	command	,	 con 	 vince 	 	them	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	right	thing	to	do	and	do	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	on	 electron 	 ic 	 	medium	.
we	 fail 	 ed 	 	.
the	mission	did	n't	work	.
and	so	now	what	we	had	to	do	is	i	had	to	reach	out	to	try	to	 re 	 build 	 	the	trust	of	that	force	,	 re 	 build 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	confidence	--	me	and	them	,	and	them	and	me	,	and	our	 senior 	 s 	 	and	us	 a 	 s 	 	a	force	--	all	 with 	 out 	 	the	ability	to	put	a	hand	on	a	shoulder	.
 entire 	 ly 	 	new	 requir 	 ement 	 	.
 al 	 so 	 	,	the	people	had	 change 	 d 	 	.
you	 prob 	 ably 	 	think	that	the	force	that	i	led	was	all	 steel 	 y 	 	-	eyed	 command 	 os 	 	with	big	knuckle	 fist 	 s 	 	 carry 	 ing 	 	 ex 	 otic 	 	 weapon 	 s 	 	.
in	 re 	 ality 	 	,	much	of	the	force	i	led	 look 	 ed 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	like	you	.
it	was	men	,	women	,	young	,	old	--	not	just	from	 militar 	 y 	 	;	from	different	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	them	 detail 	 ed 	 	to	us	just	from	a	 hand 	 shake 	 	.
and	so	 in 	 stead 	 	of	giving	 order 	 s 	 	,	you	're	now	building	 con 	 sens 	 us 	 	and	you	're	building	a	sense	of	 share 	 d 	 	purpose	.
 prob 	 ably 	 	the	 big 	 gest 	 	change	was	 understand 	 ing 	 	that	the	 generation 	 al 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 	,	the	 age 	 s 	 	,	had	 change 	 d 	 	so	much	.
i	went	down	to	be	with	a	ranger	 plat 	 oon 	 	on	an	operation	in	afghanistan	,	and	on	that	operation	,	a	 s 	 er 	 ge 	 ant 	 	in	the	 plat 	 oon 	 	had	lost	about	half	his	arm	 throw 	 ing 	 	a	taliban	hand	grenade	back	at	the	 ene 	 my 	 	after	it	had	 land 	 ed 	 	in	his	fire	team	.
we	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	the	operation	,	and	then	at	the	end	i	did	what	i	often	do	with	a	force	like	that	.
i	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	``	where	 we 	 re 	 	you	on	9/11	?	``
and	one	young	ranger	in	the	back	--	his	hair	's	 tousl 	 ed 	 	and	his	face	is	red	and	 wind 	 blown 	 	from	 be 	 ing 	 	in	combat	in	the	cold	afghan	wind	--	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 s 	 ir 	 	,	i	was	in	the	sixth	grade	.	``
and	it	 re 	 minded 	 	me	that	we	're	 oper 	 ating 	 	a	force	that	must	have	 share 	 d 	 	purpose	and	 share 	 d 	 	 conscious 	 ness 	 	,	and	yet	he	 ha 	 s 	 	different	 experience 	 s 	 	,	in	 man 	 y 	 	 case 	 s 	 	a	different	 vocabul 	 ary 	 	,	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	skill	set	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	digital	media	than	i	do	and	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	other	senior	 lead 	 ers 	 	.
and	yet	,	we	need	to	have	that	 share 	 d 	 	sense	.
it	 al 	 so 	 	 produce 	 d 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	which	i	call	an	 in 	 version 	 	of	 expert 	 ise 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	had	so	 man 	 y 	 	 change 	 s 	 	at	the	lower	 level 	 s 	 	in	technology	and	 tactic 	 s 	 	and	 what 	 not 	 	,	that	 sudden 	 ly 	 	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	grew	up	 do 	 ing 	 	was	n't	what	the	force	was	 do 	 ing 	 	 any 	 more 	 	.
so	how	 do 	 es 	 	a	 lead 	 er 	 	stay	credible	and	legitimate	when	they	have	n't	 d 	 one 	 	what	the	people	you	're	 lead 	 ing 	 	are	 do 	 ing 	 	?
and	it	's	a	brand	new	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	 challeng 	 e 	 	.
and	it	 force 	 d 	 	me	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	lot	more	 trans 	 parent 	 	,	a	lot	more	 will 	 ing 	 	to	listen	,	a	lot	more	 will 	 ing 	 	to	be	reverse	-	 mentor 	 ed 	 	from	lower	.
and	yet	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	you	're	not	all	in	one	room	.
then	 an 	 other 	 	thing	.
there	's	an	effect	on	you	and	on	your	 lead 	 ers 	 	.
there	's	an	impact	,	it	's	cumulative	.
you	do	n't	 re 	 set 	 	,	or	 re 	 charge 	 	your	 batt 	 ery 	 	every	time	.
i	stood	in	front	of	a	screen	one	night	in	 ir 	 aq 	 	with	one	of	my	senior	 officer 	 s 	 	and	we	 watch 	 ed 	 	a	 fire 	 fight 	 	from	one	of	our	 force 	 s 	 	.
and	i	 remember 	 ed 	 	his	son	was	in	our	force	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	john	,	where	's	your	son	?	and	how	is	he	?	``
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 s 	 ir 	 	,	he	's	fine	.	 thank 	 s 	 	for	 ask 	 ing 	 	.	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	where	is	he	now	?	``
and	he	 point 	 ed 	 	at	the	screen	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	he	's	in	that	 fire 	 fight 	 	.	``
think	about	 watch 	 ing 	 	your	brother	,	father	,	daughter	,	son	,	wife	in	a	 fire 	 fight 	 	in	real	time	and	you	ca	n't	do	 any 	 thing 	 	about	it	.
think	about	 know 	 ing 	 	that	over	time	.
and	it	's	a	new	cumulative	pressure	on	 lead 	 ers 	 	.
and	you	have	to	watch	and	take	care	of	each	other	.
i	 prob 	 ably 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	the	most	about	 relationship 	 s 	 	.
i	 learn 	 ed 	 	they	are	the	sinew	which	hold	the	force	together	.
i	grew	up	much	of	my	 care 	 er 	 	in	the	ranger	 regimen 	 t 	 	.
and	every	 morn 	 ing 	 	in	the	ranger	 regimen 	 t 	 	,	every	ranger	--	and	there	are	more	than	2,000	of	them	--	 say 	 s 	 	a	six	-	stanza	ranger	 cre 	 ed 	 	.
you	may	know	one	line	of	it	,	it	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	'll	never	 leav 	 e 	 	a	 fall 	 en 	 	comrade	to	fall	 in 	 to 	 	the	 hand 	 s 	 	of	the	 ene 	 my 	 	.	``
and	it	's	not	a	 mind 	 less 	 	 man 	 tra 	 	,	and	it	's	not	a	poem	.
it	's	a	promise	.
every	ranger	 promise 	 s 	 	every	other	ranger	,	``	no	matter	what	 happen 	 s 	 	,	no	matter	what	it	 cost 	 s 	 	me	,	if	you	need	me	,	i	'm	coming	.	``
and	every	ranger	 get 	 s 	 	that	same	promise	from	every	other	ranger	.
think	about	it	.	it	's	 extra 	 ordinari 	 ly 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	.
it	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	more	 power 	 ful 	 	than	marriage	 vow 	 s 	 	.
and	they	've	lived	up	to	it	,	which	 give 	 s 	 	it	special	power	.
and	so	the	 organ 	 ization 	 al 	 	relationship	that	 bond 	 s 	 	them	is	just	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	personal	 relationship 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	more	 import 	 ant 	 	than	ever	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	in	a	difficult	operation	in	afghanistan	in	2007	,	and	an	old	friend	of	mine	,	that	i	had	 s 	 pent 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	at	 vari 	 ous 	 	 point 	 s 	 	of	my	 care 	 er 	 	with	--	 god 	 father 	 	to	one	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	--	he	 s 	 ent 	 	me	a	note	,	just	in	an	 envelop 	 e 	 	,	that	had	a	quote	from	sherman	to	grant	that	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	 k 	 new 	 	if	i	ever	got	in	a	tight	spot	,	that	you	would	come	,	if	 al 	 ive 	 	.	``	and	 hav 	 ing 	 	that	kind	of	relationship	,	for	me	,	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	critical	at	 man 	 y 	 	 point 	 s 	 	in	my	 care 	 er 	 	.
and	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	you	have	to	give	that	in	 th 	 is 	 	environment	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	tough	.
that	was	my	journey	.
i	hope	it	's	not	over	.
i	came	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	a	 lead 	 er 	 	is	n't	good	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	right	;	they	're	good	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 will 	 ing 	 	to	learn	and	to	trust	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	easy	stuff	.
it	's	not	like	that	 electron 	 ic 	 	 ab 	 s 	 	machine
where	,	15	 minute 	 s 	 	a	month	,	you	get	 wash 	 board 	 	 ab 	 s 	 	.
and	it	is	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	fair	.
you	can	get	 knock 	 ed 	 	down	,	and	it	 hurt 	 s 	 	and	it	 leav 	 es 	 	 scar 	 s 	 	.
but	if	you	're	a	 lead 	 er 	 	,	the	people	you	've	 count 	 ed 	 	on	will	help	you	up	.
and	if	you	're	a	 lead 	 er 	 	,	the	people	who	count	on	you	need	you	on	your	feet	.
thank	you	.
