i	want	to	ask	you	all	to	consider	for	a	second	the	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	fact	that	,	by	far	,	most	of	what	we	know	about	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 come 	 s 	 	to	us	from	light	.
we	can	stand	on	the	earth	and	look	up	at	the	night	sky	and	see	 star 	 s 	 	with	our	bare	 eye 	 s 	 	.
the	 s 	 un 	 	 burn 	 s 	 	our	 per 	 iph 	 er 	 al 	 	vision	.	we	see	light	 reflect 	 ed 	 	off	the	moon	.	and	in	the	time	since	galileo	 point 	 ed 	 	that	 rud 	 imentary 	 	 tele 	 scope 	 	at	the	 ce 	 les 	 tial 	 	bodies	,	the	known	 uni 	 verse 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	come	to	us	through	light	,	 a 	 cross 	 	vast	 era 	 s 	 	in	 cosm 	 ic 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
and	with	all	of	our	modern	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	,	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	collect	 th 	 is 	 	 stunn 	 ing 	 	silent	movie	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	--	these	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 snap 	 shot 	 s 	 	that	go	all	the	way	back	to	the	big	bang	.
and	yet	,	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	not	a	silent	movie	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	n't	silent	.
i	'd	like	to	 con 	 vince 	 	you	that	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 sound 	 track 	 	and	that	 sound 	 track 	 	is	 play 	 ed 	 	on	space	 it 	 self 	 	,
 be 	 cause 	 	space	can	 wo 	 bble 	 	like	a	drum	.
it	can	ring	out	a	kind	of	 record 	 ing 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	of	some	of	the	most	 dramat 	 ic 	 	 event 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	 un 	 fold 	 	.
now	we	'd	like	to	be	able	to	add	to	a	kind	of	 glor 	 ious 	 	visual	 com 	 position 	 	that	we	have	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	--	a	sonic	 com 	 position 	 	.
and	while	we	've	never	heard	the	 sound 	 s 	 	from	space	,	we	 re 	 ally 	 	should	,	in	the	next	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	start	to	turn	up	the	volume	on	what	's	going	on	out	there	.
so	in	 th 	 is 	 	 ambit 	 ion 	 	to	capture	 song 	 s 	 	from	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	we	turn	our	focus	to	black	 hole 	 s 	 	and	the	promise	they	have	,	 be 	 cause 	 	black	 hole 	 s 	 	can	bang	on	space	-	time	like	 mal 	 lets 	 	on	a	drum	and	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 character 	 istic 	 	song	,
which	i	'd	like	to	play	for	you	--	some	of	our	 predict 	 ions 	 	for	what	that	song	will	be	like	.
now	black	 hole 	 s 	 	are	dark	against	a	dark	sky	.
we	ca	n't	see	them	 direct 	 ly 	 	.
they	're	not	 br 	 ought 	 	to	us	with	light	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	not	 direct 	 ly 	 	.
we	can	see	them	 in 	 direct 	 ly 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	black	 hole 	 s 	 	wreak	 ha 	 voc 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	environment	.
they	destroy	 star 	 s 	 	around	them	.
they	churn	up	 deb 	 ris 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 surround 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
but	they	wo	n't	come	to	us	 direct 	 ly 	 	through	light	.
we	might	one	day	see	a	shadow	a	black	hole	can	cast	on	a	 ver 	 y 	 	bright	 back 	 ground 	 	,	but	we	have	n't	yet	.
and	yet	black	 hole 	 s 	 	may	be	heard	even	if	they	're	not	 s 	 een 	 	,	and	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	they	bang	on	space	-	time	like	a	drum	.
now	we	owe	the	idea	that	space	can	ring	like	a	drum	to	albert	einstein	--	to	whom	we	owe	so	much	.
einstein	 real 	 ized 	 	that	if	space	 we 	 re 	 	empty	,	if	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 we 	 re 	 	empty	,	it	would	be	like	 th 	 is 	 	picture	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	 may 	 be 	 	 with 	 out 	 	the	 help 	 ful 	 	grid	drawn	on	it	.
but	if	we	 we 	 re 	 	 free 	 ly 	 	 fall 	 ing 	 	through	the	space	,	even	 with 	 out 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 help 	 ful 	 	grid	,	we	might	be	able	to	paint	it	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	would	notice	that	we	 travel 	 ed 	 	 a 	 long 	 	straight	lines	,	 un 	 deflect 	 ed 	 	straight	 path 	 s 	 	through	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
einstein	 al 	 so 	 	 real 	 ized 	 	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	real	meat	of	the	matter	--	that	if	you	put	energy	or	mass	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	it	would	 curv 	 e 	 	space	,
and	a	 free 	 ly 	 	 fall 	 ing 	 	object	would	pass	by	,	let	's	say	,	the	 s 	 un 	 	and	it	would	be	 deflect 	 ed 	 	 a 	 long 	 	the	natural	 curv 	 es 	 	in	the	space	.
it	was	einstein	's	great	general	 theor 	 y 	 	of	 relat 	 ivity 	 	.
now	even	light	will	be	bent	by	 t 	 hose 	 	 path 	 s 	 	.
and	you	can	be	bent	so	much	that	you	're	caught	in	orbit	around	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	earth	is	,	or	the	moon	around	the	earth	.
these	are	the	natural	 curv 	 es 	 	in	space	.
what	einstein	did	not	 real 	 ize 	 	was	that	,	if	you	took	our	 s 	 un 	 	and	you	 crush 	 ed 	 	it	down	to	six	 kilometer 	 s 	 	--	so	you	took	a	million	 time 	 s 	 	the	mass	of	the	earth	and	you	 crush 	 ed 	 	it	to	six	 kilometer 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	,	you	would	make	a	black	hole	,	an	object	so	dense	that	if	light	 veer 	 ed 	 	too	close	,	it	would	never	 es 	 cape 	 	--	a	dark	shadow	against	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
it	was	n't	einstein	who	 real 	 ized 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	it	was	karl	schwarzschild	who	was	a	german	jew	in	world	war	i	--	 join 	 ed 	 	the	german	 arm 	 y 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	an	 accomplish 	 ed 	 	scientist	,	 work 	 ing 	 	on	the	russian	front	.
i	like	to	imagine	schwarzschild	in	the	war	in	the	 trench 	 es 	 	 calcul 	 ating 	 	 ball 	 istic 	 	 tra 	 ject 	 ories 	 	for	 can 	 non 	 	fire	,	and	then	,	in	between	,	 calcul 	 ating 	 	einstein	's	 equ 	 ations 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	you	do	in	the	 trench 	 es 	 	.
and	he	was	 read 	 ing 	 	einstein	's	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	general	 theor 	 y 	 	of	 relat 	 ivity 	 	,	and	he	was	 thrill 	 ed 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	.
and	he	 quick 	 ly 	 	 sur 	 mis 	 ed 	 	an	exact	 mathematic 	 al 	 	solution	that	 de 	 scribed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	:	 curv 	 es 	 	so	strong	that	space	would	rain	down	 in 	 to 	 	them	,	space	 it 	 self 	 	would	 curv 	 e 	 	like	a	 water 	 fall 	 	 flow 	 ing 	 	down	the	throat	of	a	hole	.
and	even	light	could	not	 es 	 cape 	 	 th 	 is 	 	current	.
light	would	be	 drag 	 ged 	 	down	the	hole	 a 	 s 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	else	would	be	,	and	all	that	would	be	left	would	be	a	shadow	.
now	he	wrote	to	einstein	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 a 	 s 	 	you	will	see	,	the	war	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	kind	to	me	 en 	 ough 	 	.	 de 	 spite 	 	the	heavy	 gun 	 fire 	 	,
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	get	away	from	it	all	and	walk	through	the	land	of	your	 idea 	 s 	 	.	``
and	einstein	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 impress 	 ed 	 	with	his	exact	solution	,	and	i	should	hope	 al 	 so 	 	the	 d 	 ed 	 ic 	 ation 	 	of	the	scientist	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 hard 	 work 	 ing 	 	scientist	under	harsh	 condition 	 s 	 	.
and	he	took	schwarzschild	's	idea	to	the	prussian	academy	of	 science 	 s 	 	the	next	week	.
but	einstein	 al 	 ways 	 	thought	black	 hole 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	a	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 odd 	 ity 	 	.
he	did	not	 believ 	 e 	 	they	 exist 	 ed 	 	in	nature	.
he	thought	nature	would	protect	us	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 form 	 ation 	 	.
it	was	 decade 	 s 	 	before	the	term	``	black	hole	``	was	 co 	 in 	 ed 	 	and	people	 real 	 ized 	 	that	black	 hole 	 s 	 	are	real	 astro 	 physical 	 	 object 	 s 	 	--	in	fact	they	're	the	death	state	of	 ver 	 y 	 	massive	 star 	 s 	 	that	collapse	 catastroph 	 ically 	 	at	the	end	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 life 	 time 	 	.
now	our	 s 	 un 	 	will	not	collapse	to	a	black	hole	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	not	massive	 en 	 ough 	 	.
but	if	we	did	a	little	thought	experiment	--	 a 	 s 	 	einstein	was	 ver 	 y 	 	fond	of	 do 	 ing 	 	--	we	could	imagine	 put 	 ting 	 	the	 s 	 un 	 	 crush 	 ed 	 	down	to	six	 kilometer 	 s 	 	,	and	 put 	 ting 	 	a	 tin 	 y 	 	little	earth	around	it	in	orbit	,	 may 	 be 	 	30	 kilometer 	 s 	 	 out 	 side 	 	of	the	black	-	hole	 s 	 un 	 	.
and	it	would	be	self	-	 illuminate 	 d 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	now	the	 s 	 un 	 	's	gone	,	we	have	no	other	source	of	light	--	so	let	's	make	our	little	earth	self	-	 illuminate 	 d 	 	.
and	you	would	 real 	 ize 	 	you	could	put	the	earth	in	a	happy	orbit	even	30	km	 out 	 side 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 crush 	 ed 	 	black	hole	.
 th 	 is 	 	 crush 	 ed 	 	black	hole	 actual 	 ly 	 	would	fit	 in 	 side 	 	manhattan	,	more	or	less	.
it	might	 s 	 pill 	 	off	 in 	 to 	 	the	hudson	a	little	bit	before	it	 destroy 	 ed 	 	the	earth	.
but	 bas 	 ically 	 	that	's	what	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	.
we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	an	object	that	you	could	crush	down	to	half	the	square	area	of	manhattan	.
so	we	move	 th 	 is 	 	earth	 ver 	 y 	 	close	--	30	 kilometer 	 s 	 	 out 	 side 	 	--	and	we	notice	it	's	 perfect 	 ly 	 	fine	 orbit 	 ing 	 	around	the	black	hole	.
there	's	a	sort	of	myth	that	black	 hole 	 s 	 	devour	 every 	 thing 	 	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	but	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	to	get	 ver 	 y 	 	close	to	fall	in	.
but	what	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 impress 	 ive 	 	is	that	,	from	our	 van 	 t 	 age 	 	point	,	we	can	 al 	 ways 	 	see	the	earth	.
it	can	not	hide	 be 	 hind 	 	the	black	hole	.
the	light	from	the	earth	,	some	of	it	 fall 	 s 	 	in	,	but	some	of	it	 get 	 s 	 	 lens 	 ed 	 	around	and	 br 	 ought 	 	back	to	us	.
so	you	ca	n't	hide	 any 	 thing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	a	black	hole	.
if	 th 	 is 	 	 we 	 re 	 	battlestar	galactica	and	you	're	 fight 	 ing 	 	the	cylons	,	do	n't	hide	 be 	 hind 	 	the	black	hole	.
they	can	see	you	.
now	,	our	 s 	 un 	 	will	not	collapse	to	a	black	hole	--	it	's	not	massive	 en 	 ough 	 	--	but	there	are	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	black	 hole 	 s 	 	in	our	 galax 	 y 	 	.
and	if	one	 we 	 re 	 	to	eclipse	the	 milk 	 y 	 	way	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	would	look	like	.
we	would	see	a	shadow	of	that	black	hole	against	the	hundred	billion	 star 	 s 	 	in	the	 milk 	 y 	 	way	 galax 	 y 	 	and	 it 	 s 	 	 lumin 	 ous 	 	dust	 lane 	 s 	 	.
and	if	we	 we 	 re 	 	to	fall	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	black	hole	,	we	would	see	all	of	that	light	 lens 	 ed 	 	around	it	,	and	we	could	even	start	to	cross	 in 	 to 	 	that	shadow	and	 re 	 ally 	 	not	notice	that	 any 	 thing 	 	 dramat 	 ic 	 	had	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
it	would	be	bad	if	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	fire	our	 rocket 	 s 	 	and	get	out	of	there	 be 	 cause 	 	we	could	n't	,	 any 	 more 	 	than	light	can	 es 	 cape 	 	.
but	even	 th 	 ough 	 	the	black	hole	is	dark	from	the	 out 	 side 	 	,	it	's	not	dark	on	the	 in 	 side 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	all	of	the	light	from	the	 galax 	 y 	 	can	fall	in	 be 	 hind 	 	us	.
and	even	 th 	 ough 	 	,	due	to	a	 relat 	 iv 	 istic 	 	effect	known	 a 	 s 	 	time	 dil 	 ation 	 	,	our	 clock 	 s 	 	would	seem	to	 s 	 low 	 	down	 relat 	 ive 	 	to	galactic	time	,	it	would	look	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	the	evolution	of	the	 galax 	 y 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 ped 	 	up	and	shot	at	us	,	right	before	we	 we 	 re 	 	 crush 	 ed 	 	to	death	by	the	black	hole	.
it	would	be	like	a	near	-	death	experience	where	you	see	the	light	at	the	end	of	the	tunnel	,	but	it	's	a	total	death	experience	.
and	there	's	no	way	of	 tell 	 ing 	 	 any 	 body 	 	about	the	light	at	the	end	of	the	tunnel	.
now	we	've	never	 s 	 een 	 	a	shadow	like	 th 	 is 	 	of	a	black	hole	,	but	black	 hole 	 s 	 	can	be	heard	,	even	if	they	're	not	 s 	 een 	 	.
imagine	now	taking	an	 astro 	 physical 	 ly 	 	realistic	 situ 	 ation 	 	--	imagine	two	black	 hole 	 s 	 	that	have	lived	a	long	life	together	.
 may 	 be 	 	they	 start 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 star 	 s 	 	and	 collapse 	 d 	 	to	two	black	 hole 	 s 	 	--	each	one	10	 time 	 s 	 	the	mass	of	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
so	now	we	're	going	to	crush	them	down	to	60	 kilometer 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	.
they	can	be	 s 	 pinning 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 time 	 s 	 	a	second	.
at	the	end	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	,	they	're	going	around	each	other	 ver 	 y 	 	near	the	speed	of	light	.
so	they	're	 cross 	 ing 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 kilometer 	 s 	 	in	a	fraction	of	a	second	,
and	 a 	 s 	 	they	do	so	,	they	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 curv 	 e 	 	space	,	but	they	 leav 	 e 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	wake	a	 ring 	 ing 	 	of	space	,	an	actual	wave	on	space	-	time	.
space	 squeez 	 es 	 	and	 stretch 	 es 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	 emanate 	 s 	 	out	from	these	black	 hole 	 s 	 	 bang 	 ing 	 	on	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
and	they	travel	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	 cosmo 	 s 	 	at	the	speed	of	light	.
 th 	 is 	 	computer	 simul 	 ation 	 	is	due	to	a	 relat 	 ivity 	 	group	at	nasa	goddard	.
it	took	 al 	 most 	 	30	 year 	 s 	 	for	 any 	 one 	 	in	the	world	to	crack	 th 	 is 	 	problem	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	one	of	the	 group 	 s 	 	.
it	 show 	 s 	 	two	black	 hole 	 s 	 	in	orbit	around	each	other	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	with	these	 help 	 fully 	 	 paint 	 ed 	 	 curv 	 es 	 	.
and	if	you	can	see	--	it	's	kind	of	faint	--	but	if	you	can	see	the	red	 wave 	 s 	 	 e 	 man 	 ating 	 	out	,	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	 gravit 	 ation 	 al 	 	 wave 	 s 	 	.
they	're	 liter 	 ally 	 	the	 sound 	 s 	 	of	space	 ring 	 ing 	 	,	and	they	will	travel	out	from	these	black	 hole 	 s 	 	at	the	speed	of	light	 a 	 s 	 	they	ring	down	and	coalesce	to	one	 s 	 pinning 	 	,	quiet	black	hole	at	the	end	of	the	day	.
if	you	 we 	 re 	 	 stand 	 ing 	 	near	 en 	 ough 	 	,	your	ear	would	 reson 	 ate 	 	with	the	 squeez 	 ing 	 	and	 stretch 	 ing 	 	of	space	.
you	would	 liter 	 ally 	 	hear	the	sound	.
now	of	course	,	your	head	would	be	 squeez 	 ed 	 	and	 stretch 	 ed 	 	 un 	 help 	 fully 	 	,	so	you	might	have	trouble	 understand 	 ing 	 	what	's	going	on	.
but	i	'd	like	to	play	for	you	the	sound	that	we	predict	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	from	my	group	--	a	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	less	 glamor 	 ous 	 	computer	 model 	 ing 	 	.
imagine	a	 light 	 er 	 	black	hole	 fall 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	heavy	black	hole	.
the	sound	you	're	 hear 	 ing 	 	is	the	light	black	hole	 bang 	 ing 	 	on	space	each	time	it	 get 	 s 	 	close	.
if	it	 get 	 s 	 	far	away	,	it	's	a	little	too	quiet	.
but	it	 come 	 s 	 	in	like	a	 malle 	 t 	 	,	and	it	 liter 	 ally 	 	 crack 	 s 	 	space	,	 wo 	 b 	 bling 	 	it	like	a	drum	.
and	we	can	predict	what	the	sound	will	be	.
we	know	that	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 fall 	 s 	 	in	,	it	 get 	 s 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	and	it	 get 	 s 	 	 loud 	 er 	 	.
and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	we	're	going	to	hear	the	little	guy	just	fall	 in 	 to 	 	the	 big 	 ger 	 	guy	.
then	it	's	gone	.
now	i	've	never	heard	it	that	loud	--	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	more	 dramat 	 ic 	 	.
at	home	it	 sound 	 s 	 	kind	of	 antic 	 lim 	 act 	 ic 	 	.
it	's	sort	of	like	 d 	 ing 	 	,	 d 	 ing 	 	,	 d 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	sound	from	my	group	.
no	,	i	'm	not	 show 	 ing 	 	you	any	 image 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	black	 hole 	 s 	 	do	n't	 leav 	 e 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	 help 	 ful 	 	 trail 	 s 	 	of	ink	,	and	space	is	not	 paint 	 ed 	 	,	 show 	 ing 	 	you	the	 curv 	 es 	 	.
but	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	to	float	by	in	space	on	a	space	 holi 	 day 	 	and	you	heard	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	want	to	get	moving	.
want	to	get	away	from	the	sound	.
both	black	 hole 	 s 	 	are	moving	.
both	black	 hole 	 s 	 	are	 get 	 ting 	 	 close 	 r 	 	together	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	they	're	both	 wo 	 b 	 bling 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	a	lot	.
and	then	they	're	going	to	merge	.
now	it	's	gone	.
now	that	chirp	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 character 	 istic 	 	of	black	 hole 	 s 	 	 mer 	 ging 	 	--	that	it	 chirp 	 s 	 	up	at	the	end	.
now	that	's	our	 predict 	 ion 	 	for	what	we	'll	see	.
 luck 	 ily 	 	we	're	at	 th 	 is 	 	safe	distance	in	long	beach	,	california	.
and	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	,	 some 	 where 	 	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	two	black	 hole 	 s 	 	have	 merge 	 d 	 	.
and	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	,	the	space	around	us	is	 ring 	 ing 	 	after	 travel 	 ing 	 	 may 	 be 	 	a	million	light	 year 	 s 	 	,	or	a	million	 year 	 s 	 	,	at	the	speed	of	light	to	get	to	us	.
but	the	sound	is	too	quiet	for	any	of	us	to	ever	hear	.
there	are	 ver 	 y 	 	industrious	 experiment 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	built	on	earth	--	one	 call 	 ed 	 	ligo	--	which	will	detect	 dev 	 iation 	 s 	 	in	the	 squeez 	 ing 	 	and	 stretch 	 ing 	 	of	space	at	less	than	the	fraction	of	a	nucleus	of	an	atom	over	four	 kilometer 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	 remark 	 ably 	 	 ambit 	 ious 	 	experiment	,	and	it	's	going	to	be	at	 advance 	 d 	 	 sensitiv 	 ity 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	next	few	 year 	 s 	 	--	to	pick	 th 	 is 	 	up	.
there	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	mission	 pro 	 posed 	 	for	space	,	which	 hope 	 fully 	 	will	launch	in	the	next	ten	 year 	 s 	 	,	 call 	 ed 	 	lisa	.	and	lisa	will	be	able	to	see	super	-	massive	black	 hole 	 s 	 	--	black	 hole 	 s 	 	 million 	 s 	 	or	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 time 	 s 	 	the	mass	of	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	hubble	image	,	we	see	two	 galax 	 ies 	 	.
they	look	like	they	're	 froze 	 n 	 	in	some	embrace	.
and	each	one	 prob 	 ably 	 	 harbor 	 s 	 	a	super	-	massive	black	hole	at	 it 	 s 	 	core	.
but	they	're	not	 froze 	 n 	 	;	they	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 mer 	 ging 	 	.
these	two	black	 hole 	 s 	 	are	 coll 	 id 	 ing 	 	,	and	they	will	merge	over	a	billion	-	year	time	scale	.
it	's	beyond	our	human	 per 	 ception 	 	to	pick	up	a	song	of	that	 dur 	 ation 	 	.
but	lisa	could	see	the	final	 stage 	 s 	 	of	two	super	-	massive	black	 hole 	 s 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	's	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	the	last	15	 minute 	 s 	 	before	they	fall	together	.
and	it	's	not	just	black	 hole 	 s 	 	,	but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	any	big	 disturb 	 ance 	 	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	--	and	the	 big 	 gest 	 	of	them	all	is	the	big	bang	.
when	that	 express 	 ion 	 	was	 co 	 in 	 ed 	 	,	it	was	 deris 	 ive 	 	--	like	,	``	oh	,	who	would	 believ 	 e 	 	in	a	big	bang	?	``	but	now	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	might	be	more	 technical 	 ly 	 	accurate	 be 	 cause 	 	it	might	bang	.	it	might	make	a	sound	.
 th 	 is 	 	 anim 	 ation 	 	from	my	 friend 	 s 	 	at	proton	 studio 	 s 	 	 show 	 s 	 	looking	at	the	big	bang	from	the	 out 	 side 	 	.
we	do	n't	ever	want	to	do	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	.	we	want	to	be	 in 	 side 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	no	 s 	 uch 	 	thing	 a 	 s 	 	 stand 	 ing 	 	 out 	 side 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
so	imagine	you	're	 in 	 side 	 	the	big	bang	.
it	's	 every 	 where 	 	,	it	's	all	around	you	,	and	the	space	is	 wo 	 b 	 bling 	 	 chaotic 	 ally 	 	.
 four 	 teen 	 	billion	 year 	 s 	 	pass	and	 th 	 is 	 	song	is	still	 ring 	 ing 	 	all	around	us	.
 galax 	 ies 	 	form	,	and	 generation 	 s 	 	of	 star 	 s 	 	form	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 galax 	 ies 	 	,
and	around	one	star	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	one	star	,	is	a	 habit 	 able 	 	planet	.
and	here	we	are	 fr 	 ant 	 ically 	 	building	these	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	 do 	 ing 	 	these	 calcul 	 ations 	 	,	writing	these	computer	 code 	 s 	 	.
imagine	a	billion	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	two	black	 hole 	 s 	 	 collide 	 d 	 	.
that	song	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 ring 	 ing 	 	through	space	for	all	that	time	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	n't	even	here	.
it	 get 	 s 	 	 close 	 r 	 	and	 close 	 r 	 	--	40,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	we	're	still	 do 	 ing 	 	cave	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
it	's	like	 hur 	 ry 	 	,	build	your	 instrument 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 get 	 ting 	 	 close 	 r 	 	and	 close 	 r 	 	,	and	in	20	...	 what 	 ever 	 	year	it	will	be	when	our	 detect 	 ors 	 	are	 final 	 ly 	 	at	 advance 	 d 	 	 sensitiv 	 ity 	 	--	we	'll	build	them	,	we	'll	turn	on	the	 machine 	 s 	 	and	,	bang	,	we	'll	catch	it	--	the	first	song	from	space	.
if	it	was	the	big	bang	we	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	pick	up	,	it	would	sound	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	's	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	sound	.
it	's	 liter 	 ally 	 	the	definition	of	noise	.
it	's	white	noise	;	it	's	 s 	 uch 	 	a	chaotic	 ring 	 ing 	 	.
but	it	's	around	us	 every 	 where 	 	,	 pre 	 sum 	 ably 	 	,	if	it	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 be 	 en 	 	 wipe 	 d 	 	out	by	some	other	process	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
and	if	we	pick	it	up	,	it	will	be	music	to	our	 ear 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	will	be	the	quiet	echo	of	that	moment	of	our	creation	,	of	our	 observ 	 able 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
so	 with 	 in 	 	the	next	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	'll	be	able	to	turn	up	the	 sound 	 track 	 	a	little	bit	,	render	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	in	audio	.
but	if	we	detect	 t 	 hose 	 	 ear 	 liest 	 	 moment 	 s 	 	,	it	'll	 br 	 ing 	 	us	that	much	 close 	 r 	 	to	an	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	the	big	bang	,	which	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	us	that	much	 close 	 r 	 	to	 ask 	 ing 	 	some	of	the	 hard 	 est 	 	,	most	elusive	,	 question 	 s 	 	.
if	we	run	the	movie	of	our	 uni 	 verse 	 	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	we	know	that	there	was	a	big	bang	in	our	past	,	and	we	might	even	hear	the	 caco 	 phon 	 ous 	 	sound	of	it	,	but	was	our	big	bang	the	 on 	 ly 	 	big	bang	?
i	mean	we	have	to	ask	,	 ha 	 s 	 	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	before	?
will	it	happen	 aga 	 in 	 	?
i	mean	,	in	the	spirit	of	 ris 	 ing 	 	to	ted	's	 challeng 	 e 	 	to	 re 	 ignite 	 	wonder	,	we	can	ask	 question 	 s 	 	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	last	minute	,	that	 honest 	 ly 	 	might	 evad 	 e 	 	us	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
but	we	have	to	ask	:	is	it	possible	that	our	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	just	a	plume	off	of	some	 great 	 er 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	?
or	,	is	it	possible	that	we	're	just	a	branch	off	of	a	 multi 	 verse 	 	--	each	branch	with	 it 	 s 	 	own	big	bang	in	 it 	 s 	 	past	--	 may 	 be 	 	some	of	them	with	black	 hole 	 s 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	 drum 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	some	 with 	 out 	 	--	 may 	 be 	 	some	with	 senti 	 ent 	 	life	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	some	 with 	 out 	 	--	not	in	our	past	,	not	in	our	future	,	but	 some 	 how 	 	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	us	?
so	we	have	to	wonder	,	if	there	is	a	 multi 	 verse 	 	,	in	some	other	patch	of	that	 multi 	 verse 	 	,	are	there	 creature 	 s 	 	?
here	's	my	 multi 	 verse 	 	 creature 	 s 	 	.
are	there	other	 creature 	 s 	 	in	the	 multi 	 verse 	 	,	 wonder 	 ing 	 	about	us	and	 wonder 	 ing 	 	about	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 origin 	 s 	 	?
and	if	they	are	,	i	can	imagine	them	 a 	 s 	 	we	are	,	 calcul 	 ating 	 	,	writing	computer	code	,	building	 instrument 	 s 	 	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	detect	that	 faint 	 est 	 	sound	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 origin 	 s 	 	and	 wonder 	 ing 	 	who	else	is	out	there	.
thank	you	.	thank	you	.
