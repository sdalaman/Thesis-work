pat	mitchell	:	you	have	 br 	 ought 	 	us	 image 	 s 	 	from	the	yemen	 time 	 s 	 	.
and	take	us	through	 t 	 hose 	 	,	and	 introduc 	 e 	 	us	to	 an 	 other 	 	yemen	.
nadia	al-sakkaf	:	well	,	i	'm	glad	to	be	here	.
and	i	would	like	to	share	with	you	all	some	of	the	 picture 	 s 	 	that	are	 happen 	 ing 	 	 to 	 day 	 	in	yemen	.
 th 	 is 	 	picture	 show 	 s 	 	a	revolution	 start 	 ed 	 	by	women	,
and	it	 show 	 s 	 	women	and	men	 lead 	 ing 	 	a	 mix 	 ed 	 	protest	.
the	other	picture	is	the	 popular 	 ity 	 	of	the	real	need	for	change	.
so	 man 	 y 	 	people	are	there	.
the	 intens 	 ity 	 	of	the	 up 	 spring 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	picture	 show 	 s 	 	that	the	revolution	 ha 	 s 	 	 allow 	 ed 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	for	training	,	for	education	.
these	women	are	 learn 	 ing 	 	about	first	aid	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 right 	 s 	 	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	the	 constit 	 ution 	 	.
i	love	 th 	 is 	 	picture	.
i	just	 want 	 ed 	 	to	show	that	over	60	percent	of	the	yemeni	population	are	15	 year 	 s 	 	and	 be 	 low 	 	.
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 exclude 	 d 	 	from	decision	-	making	,	and	now	they	are	in	the	 fore 	 front 	 	of	the	news	,	raising	the	flag	.
english	--	you	will	see	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 jean 	 s 	 	and	 tight 	 s 	 	,	and	an	english	 express 	 ion 	 	--	the	ability	to	share	with	the	world	what	is	going	on	in	our	own	country	.
and	 express 	 ion 	 	 al 	 so 	 	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	 talent 	 s 	 	.	yemenis	are	using	 cartoon 	 s 	 	and	art	,	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	 com 	 ic 	 s 	 	,	to	tell	the	world	and	each	other	about	what	's	going	on	.
 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	there	's	 al 	 ways 	 	the	dark	side	of	it	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	one	of	the	less	-	gruesome	 picture 	 s 	 	of	the	revolution	and	the	cost	that	we	have	to	pay	.
the	 solid 	 arity 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	yemenis	 a 	 cross 	 	the	country	just	 demand 	 ing 	 	the	one	thing	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	 lot 	 s 	 	of	people	are	 say 	 ing 	 	that	yemen	's	revolution	is	going	to	break	the	country	.
is	it	going	to	be	so	 man 	 y 	 	different	 count 	 ries 	 	?
is	it	going	to	be	 an 	 other 	 	somalia	?
but	we	want	to	tell	the	world	that	,	no	,	under	the	one	flag	,	we	'll	still	remain	 a 	 s 	 	yemeni	people	.
pm	:	thank	you	for	 t 	 hose 	 	 image 	 s 	 	,	nadia	.
and	they	do	,	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	,	tell	a	different	story	than	the	story	of	yemen	,	the	one	that	is	often	in	the	news	.	and	yet	,	you	 your 	 self 	 	defy	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 character 	 ization 	 s 	 	.
so	let	's	talk	about	the	personal	story	for	a	moment	.
your	father	is	 murder 	 ed 	 	.
the	yemen	 time 	 s 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	strong	reputation	in	yemen	 a 	 s 	 	an	 in 	 dependent 	 	english	language	 news 	 paper 	 	.	how	did	you	then	make	the	decision	and	 assum 	 e 	 	the	 respons 	 ibilities 	 	of	running	a	 news 	 paper 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	in	 s 	 uch 	 	 time 	 s 	 	of	conflict	?
na	:	well	,	let	me	first	 war 	 n 	 	you	that	i	'm	not	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	yemeni	girl	.
i	've	 guess 	 ed 	 	you	've	 al 	 ready 	 	 notice 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	by	now	.
in	yemen	,	most	women	are	 veil 	 ed 	 	and	they	are	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	 door 	 s 	 	and	not	 ver 	 y 	 	much	part	of	the	public	life	.
but	there	's	so	much	potential	.	i	wish	i	could	show	you	my	yemen	.	i	wish	you	could	see	yemen	through	my	 eye 	 s 	 	.
then	you	would	know	that	there	's	so	much	to	it	.
and	i	was	 privilege 	 d 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	born	 in 	 to 	 	a	family	,	my	father	would	 al 	 ways 	 	 encourag 	 e 	 	the	 boy 	 s 	 	and	the	 girl 	 s 	 	.
he	would	say	we	are	equal	.
and	he	was	 s 	 uch 	 	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	man	.
and	even	my	mother	--	i	owe	it	to	my	family	.	a	story	:
i	 stud 	 ied 	 	in	india	.
and	in	my	third	year	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 be 	 coming 	 	 con 	 fused 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	yemeni	,	but	i	was	 al 	 so 	 	 mix 	 ing 	 	up	with	a	lot	of	my	 friend 	 s 	 	in	college	.
and	i	went	back	home	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 d 	 addy 	 	,	i	do	n't	know	who	i	am	.
i	'm	not	a	yemeni	;	i	'm	not	an	indian	.	``
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	are	the	bridge	.	``
and	that	is	 some 	 thing 	 	i	will	keep	in	my	heart	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
so	since	then	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	the	bridge	,	and	a	lot	of	people	have	 walk 	 ed 	 	over	me	.
pm	:	i	do	n't	think	so	.
na	:	but	it	just	 help 	 s 	 	tell	that	some	people	are	change	 agent 	 s 	 	in	the	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
and	when	i	 be 	 came 	 	editor	-	in	-	chief	after	my	brother	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	my	father	 pass 	 ed 	 	away	in	1999	,	and	then	my	brother	 un 	 til 	 	2005	--	and	 every 	 body 	 	was	 bet 	 ting 	 	that	i	will	not	be	able	to	do	it	.
``	what	's	 th 	 is 	 	young	girl	coming	in	and	 show 	 ing 	 	off	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	her	family	business	,	``	or	 some 	 thing 	 	.	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	at	first	.
i	did	n't	want	to	 c 	 lash 	 	with	people	.
but	with	all	due	respect	to	all	the	men	,	and	the	 old 	 er 	 	men	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	,	they	did	not	want	me	around	.
it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	,	you	know	,	to	impose	my	 author 	 ity 	 	.
but	a	woman	's	got	to	do	what	a	woman	's	got	to	do	.
and	in	the	first	year	,	i	had	to	fire	half	of	the	men	.
 br 	 ought 	 	in	more	women	.
 br 	 ought 	 	in	 young 	 er 	 	men	.
and	we	have	a	more	gender	-	 balanc 	 ed 	 	 news 	 room 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
the	other	thing	is	that	it	's	about	 professional 	 ism 	 	.
it	's	about	 prov 	 ing 	 	who	you	are	and	what	you	can	do	.
and	i	do	n't	know	if	i	'm	going	to	be	 boast 	 ing 	 	now	,	but	in	2006	 al 	 one 	 	,	we	won	three	 inter 	 national 	 	 a 	 ward 	 s 	 	.	one	of	them	is	the	ipi	free	media	pioneer	 a 	 ward 	 	.
so	that	was	the	answer	to	all	the	yemeni	people	.
and	i	want	to	score	a	point	here	,	 be 	 cause 	 	my	husband	is	in	the	room	over	there	.
if	you	could	 pleas 	 e 	 	stand	up	,	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	.
he	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 support 	 ive 	 	of	me	.
pm	:	and	we	should	point	out	that	he	 work 	 s 	 	with	you	 a 	 s 	 	well	at	the	paper	.
but	in	 assum 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 respons 	 ibility 	 	and	going	about	it	 a 	 s 	 	you	have	,	you	have	 be 	 come 	 	a	bridge	between	an	 old 	 er 	 	and	 tradition 	 al 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	and	the	one	that	you	are	now	creating	at	the	paper	.
and	so	 a 	 long 	 	with	changing	who	 work 	 ed 	 	there	,	you	must	have	come	up	against	 an 	 other 	 	 position 	 ing 	 	that	we	 al 	 ways 	 	run	 in 	 to 	 	,	in	 part 	 icular 	 	with	women	,	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	with	 out 	 side 	 	image	,	dress	,	the	 veil 	 ed 	 	woman	.
so	how	have	you	 deal 	 t 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	on	a	personal	level	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	the	women	who	 work 	 ed 	 	for	you	?
na	:	 a 	 s 	 	you	know	,	the	image	of	a	lot	of	yemeni	women	is	a	lot	of	black	and	 cover 	 ed 	 	,	 veil 	 ed 	 	women	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	true	.
and	a	lot	of	it	is	 be 	 cause 	 	women	are	not	able	,	are	not	free	,	to	show	 the 	 ir 	 	face	to	 the 	 ir 	 	self	.
it	's	a	lot	of	 tradition 	 al 	 	 im 	 posing 	 	coming	by	 author 	 ity 	 	 figure 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	men	,	the	 grand 	 parent 	 s 	 	and	so	on	.
and	it	's	economic	 empower 	 ment 	 	and	the	ability	for	a	woman	to	say	,	``	i	am	 a 	 s 	 	much	 con 	 trib 	 uting 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	family	,	or	more	,	than	you	are	.	``	and	the	more	 empower 	 ed 	 	the	women	 be 	 come 	 	,	the	more	they	are	able	to	 re 	 move 	 	the	veil	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	or	to	drive	 the 	 ir 	 	own	car	or	to	have	a	job	or	to	be	able	to	travel	.
so	the	other	face	of	yemen	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	one	that	lies	 be 	 hind 	 	the	veil	,
and	it	's	economic	 empower 	 ment 	 	 most 	 ly 	 	that	 allow 	 s 	 	the	woman	to	just	 un 	 cover 	 	it	.
and	i	have	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 through 	 out 	 	my	work	.
i	've	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	 encourag 	 e 	 	young	 girl 	 s 	 	.
we	 start 	 ed 	 	with	,	you	can	take	it	off	in	the	 off 	 ice 	 	.
and	then	after	that	,	you	can	take	it	off	on	 assign 	 ments 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	did	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	a	journalist	can	be	a	journalist	with	--	how	can	you	talk	to	people	if	you	have	your	face	 cover 	 ed 	 	?	--	and	so	on	;	it	's	just	a	 move 	 ment 	 	.
and	i	am	a	role	model	in	yemen	.
a	lot	of	people	look	up	to	me	.
a	lot	of	young	 girl 	 s 	 	look	up	to	me	.
and	i	need	to	prove	to	them	that	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	you	can	still	be	married	,	you	can	still	be	a	mother	,	and	you	can	still	be	 respect 	 ed 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	but	at	the	same	time	,	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	you	[	should	]	just	be	one	of	the	crowd	.
you	can	be	 your 	 self 	 	and	have	your	face	.
pm	:	but	by	 put 	 ting 	 	 your 	 self 	 	 personal 	 ly 	 	out	there	--	both	 project 	 ing 	 	a	different	image	of	yemeni	women	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	what	you	have	made	possible	for	the	women	who	work	at	the	paper	--	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	put	you	in	personal	danger	?
na	:	well	the	yemen	 time 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 cross 	 	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	through	so	much	.
we	've	 suffer 	 ed 	 	 prosecut 	 ion 	 	;	the	paper	was	closed	down	more	than	three	 time 	 s 	 	.
it	's	an	 in 	 dependent 	 	 news 	 paper 	 	,	but	tell	that	to	the	people	in	charge	.
they	think	that	if	there	's	 any 	 thing 	 	against	them	,	then	we	are	 be 	 ing 	 	an	 op 	 position 	 	 news 	 paper 	 	.
and	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	 time 	 s 	 	.
some	of	my	 report 	 ers 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 arrest 	 ed 	 	.
we	had	some	court	 case 	 s 	 	.
my	father	was	 assassin 	 ated 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	we	are	in	a	much	better	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
we	've	 create 	 d 	 	the	 cr 	 ed 	 ibility 	 	.
and	in	 time 	 s 	 	of	revolution	or	change	like	 to 	 day 	 	,	it	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	for	 in 	 dependent 	 	media	to	have	a	voice	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	for	you	to	go	to	yementimes.com	,	and	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	listen	to	our	voice	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	i	'm	going	to	share	with	you	in	western	media	 prob 	 ably 	 	--	and	how	there	's	a	lot	of	 stereo 	 type 	 s 	 	--	 think 	 ing 	 	of	yemen	in	one	single	frame	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	yemen	is	all	about	.
and	that	's	not	fair	.
it	's	not	fair	for	me	;	it	's	not	fair	for	my	country	.
a	lot	of	 report 	 ers 	 	come	to	yemen	and	they	want	to	write	a	story	on	al-qaeda	or	 terror 	 ism 	 	.	and	i	just	 want 	 ed 	 	to	share	with	you	:	there	's	one	 report 	 er 	 	that	came	.
he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	a	 document 	 ary 	 	on	what	his	 editor 	 s 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	.
and	he	 end 	 ed 	 	up	writing	about	a	story	that	even	 surprise 	 d 	 	me	--	hip	hop	--	that	there	are	young	yemeni	men	who	express	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	through	 danc 	 ing 	 	and	 pu 	 chu 	 	 pu 	 chu 	 	.
that	thing	.
 yea 	 h 	 	,	break	 danc 	 ing 	 	.
i	'm	not	so	old	.
i	'm	just	not	in	touch	.
pm	:	 y 	 es 	 	,	you	are	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	that	's	a	 document 	 ary 	 	that	's	 avail 	 able 	 	 on 	 line 	 	;	the	video	's	 on 	 line 	 	.

pm	:	shakethedust.org	.
and	it	 definite 	 ly 	 	 do 	 es 	 	give	a	different	image	of	yemen	.
you	spoke	about	the	 respons 	 ibility 	 	of	the	press	.
and	 certain 	 ly 	 	,	when	we	look	at	the	ways	in	which	we	have	 separat 	 ed 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	from	 other 	 s 	 	and	we	've	 create 	 d 	 	fear	and	danger	,	often	from	lack	of	knowledge	,	lack	of	real	 understand 	 ing 	 	,	how	do	you	see	the	way	that	the	western	press	in	 part 	 icular 	 	is	 cover 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	and	all	other	 st 	 ories 	 	out	of	the	region	,	but	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	in	your	country	?
na	:	well	there	is	a	 say 	 ing 	 	that	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	you	fear	what	you	do	n't	know	,	and	you	hate	what	you	fear	.	``
so	it	's	about	the	lack	of	research	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	.
it	's	 al 	 most 	 	,	``	do	your	 home 	 work 	 	,	``	--	some	 involve 	 ment 	 	.
and	you	can	not	do	 parachut 	 e 	 	 report 	 ing 	 	--	just	jump	 in 	 to 	 	a	country	for	two	 day 	 s 	 	and	think	that	you	've	 d 	 one 	 	your	 home 	 work 	 	and	a	story	.
so	i	wish	that	the	world	would	know	my	yemen	,	my	country	,	my	people	.
i	am	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	and	there	are	 other 	 s 	 	like	me	.
we	may	not	be	that	 man 	 y 	 	,	but	if	we	are	 promote 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	good	,	positive	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	there	will	be	 other 	 s 	 	--	men	and	women	--	who	can	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	bridge	the	gap	--	 aga 	 in 	 	,	coming	to	the	bridge	--	between	yemen	and	the	world	and	 tell 	 ing 	 	first	about	 re 	 cognition 	 	and	then	about	communication	and	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
i	think	yemen	is	going	to	be	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	bad	 situ 	 ation 	 	in	the	next	two	or	three	 year 	 s 	 	.
it	's	natural	.
but	after	the	two	 year 	 s 	 	,	which	is	a	price	we	are	 will 	 ing 	 	to	pay	,	we	are	going	to	stand	up	 aga 	 in 	 	on	our	feet	,	but	in	the	new	yemen	with	a	 young 	 er 	 	and	more	 empower 	 ed 	 	people	--	 democrat 	 ic 	 	.
pm	:	nadia	,	i	think	you	've	just	 give 	 n 	 	us	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	view	of	yemen	.
