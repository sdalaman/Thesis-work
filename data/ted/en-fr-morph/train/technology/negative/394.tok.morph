so	,	about	three	 year 	 s 	 	ago	i	was	in	london	,	and	 some 	 body 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	howard	burton	came	to	me	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	i	represent	a	group	of	people	,	and	we	want	to	start	an	institute	in	 theoretic 	 al 	 	physics	.
we	have	about	120	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	and	we	want	to	do	it	well	.
we	want	to	be	in	the	 fore 	 front 	 	 field 	 s 	 	,	and	we	want	to	do	it	 different 	 ly 	 	.
we	want	to	get	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	thing	where	the	young	people	have	all	the	 idea 	 s 	 	,	and	the	old	people	have	all	the	power	and	decide	what	science	 get 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	.
it	took	me	about	25	 second 	 s 	 	to	decide	that	that	was	a	good	idea	.
three	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	we	have	the	 peri 	 meter 	 	institute	for	 theoretic 	 al 	 	physics	in	waterloo	,	ontario	.	it	's	the	most	 excit 	 ing 	 	job	i	've	ever	had	.
and	it	's	the	first	time	i	've	had	a	job	where	i	'm	 af 	 raid 	 	to	go	away	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 every 	 thing 	 	that	's	going	to	happen	in	 th 	 is 	 	week	when	i	'm	here	.
but	in	any	case	,	what	i	'm	going	to	do	in	my	little	bit	of	time	is	take	you	on	a	quick	tour	of	some	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	talk	about	and	we	think	about	.
so	,	we	think	a	lot	about	what	 re 	 ally 	 	 make 	 s 	 	science	work	?
the	first	thing	that	 any 	 body 	 	who	 know 	 s 	 	science	,	and	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	around	science	,	is	that	the	stuff	you	learn	in	school	 a 	 s 	 	a	scientific	method	is	wrong	.	there	is	no	method	.
on	the	other	hand	,	 some 	 how 	 	we	manage	to	reason	together	 a 	 s 	 	a	community	,	from	 in 	 complete 	 	evidence	to	 con 	 clusion 	 s 	 	that	we	all	agree	about	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	by	the	way	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	a	 democrat 	 ic 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	.
so	how	 do 	 es 	 	it	work	?
well	,	my	belief	is	that	it	 work 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 scientist 	 s 	 	are	a	community	bound	together	by	an	 ethic 	 s 	 	.
and	here	are	some	of	the	 ethic 	 al 	 	 principle 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	not	going	to	read	them	all	to	you	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	not	in	teacher	mode	.
i	'm	in	entertain	,	amaze	mode	.
but	one	of	the	 principle 	 s 	 	is	that	 every 	 body 	 	who	is	part	of	the	community	 get 	 s 	 	to	fight	and	 argu 	 e 	 	 a 	 s 	 	hard	 a 	 s 	 	they	can	for	what	they	 believ 	 e 	 	.
but	we	're	all	 discipline 	 d 	 	by	the	 understand 	 ing 	 	that	the	 on 	 ly 	 	people	who	are	going	to	decide	,	you	know	,	 whet 	 her 	 	i	'm	right	or	 some 	 body 	 	else	is	right	,	are	the	people	in	our	community	in	the	next	generation	,	in	30	and	50	 year 	 s 	 	.
so	it	's	 th 	 is 	 	combination	of	respect	for	the	tradition	and	community	we	're	in	,	and	 rebel 	 lion 	 	that	the	community	 requir 	 es 	 	to	get	 any 	 where 	 	,	that	 make 	 s 	 	science	work	.
and	 be 	 ing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	process	of	 be 	 ing 	 	in	a	community	that	 reason 	 s 	 	from	 share 	 d 	 	evidence	to	 con 	 clusion 	 s 	 	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	 teach 	 es 	 	us	about	 demo 	 cracy 	 	.
not	 on 	 ly 	 	is	there	a	relationship	between	the	 ethic 	 s 	 	of	science	and	the	 ethic 	 s 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	a	citizen	in	 demo 	 cracy 	 	,	but	there	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	,	 historic 	 ally 	 	,	a	relationship	between	how	people	think	about	space	and	time	,	and	what	the	 cosmo 	 s 	 	is	,	and	how	people	think	about	the	 socie 	 ty 	 	that	they	live	in	.
and	i	want	to	talk	about	three	 stage 	 s 	 	in	that	evolution	.
the	first	science	of	 cosmo 	 logy 	 	that	was	 any 	 thing 	 	like	science	was	aristotelian	science	,	and	that	was	 hierarch 	 ical 	 	.
the	earth	is	in	the	center	,	then	there	are	these	crystal	 sphere 	 s 	 	,	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	the	moon	,	the	 planet 	 s 	 	and	 final 	 ly 	 	the	 ce 	 les 	 tial 	 	sphere	,	where	the	 star 	 s 	 	are	.	and	 every 	 thing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	place	.
and	aristotle	's	law	of	motion	was	that	 every 	 thing 	 	 go 	 es 	 	to	 it 	 s 	 	natural	place	,	which	was	of	course	,	the	rule	of	the	 socie 	 ty 	 	that	aristotle	lived	in	,	and	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	the	 med 	 ieval 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	that	,	through	christianity	,	 embrace 	 d 	 	aristotle	and	 bless 	 ed 	 	it	.
and	the	idea	is	that	 every 	 thing 	 	is	defined	.
where	 some 	 thing 	 	is	,	is	defined	with	respect	to	 th 	 is 	 	last	sphere	,	the	 ce 	 les 	 tial 	 	sphere	,	 out 	 side 	 	of	which	is	 th 	 is 	 	 e 	 ternal 	 	,	perfect	realm	,	where	 live 	 s 	 	god	,	who	is	the	ultimate	 judg 	 e 	 	of	 every 	 thing 	 	.
so	that	is	both	aristotelian	 cosmo 	 logy 	 	,	and	in	a	certain	sense	,	 med 	 ieval 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
now	,	in	the	17th	century	there	was	a	revolution	in	 think 	 ing 	 	about	space	and	time	and	motion	and	so	forth	of	newton	.
and	at	the	same	time	there	was	a	revolution	in	social	thought	of	john	locke	and	his	 collabor 	 ators 	 	.
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 close 	 ly 	 	 associate 	 d 	 	.
in	fact	,	newton	and	locke	 we 	 re 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	.
 the 	 ir 	 	way	of	 think 	 ing 	 	about	space	and	time	and	motion	on	the	one	hand	,	and	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	on	the	other	hand	,	 we 	 re 	 	 close 	 ly 	 	related	.
and	let	me	show	you	.
in	a	newtonian	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	there	's	no	center	--	thank	you	.
there	are	 particle 	 s 	 	and	they	move	around	with	respect	to	a	 fix 	 ed 	 	,	absolute	 frame 	 work 	 	of	space	and	time	.
it	's	 meaning 	 ful 	 	to	say	 absolute 	 ly 	 	where	 some 	 thing 	 	is	in	space	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	defined	,	not	with	respect	to	say	,	where	other	 thing 	 s 	 	are	,	but	with	respect	to	 th 	 is 	 	absolute	 not 	 ion 	 	of	space	,	which	for	newton	was	god	.
now	,	 similar 	 ly 	 	,	in	locke	's	 socie 	 ty 	 	there	are	 individual 	 s 	 	who	have	certain	 right 	 s 	 	,	 proper 	 ties 	 	in	a	 form 	 al 	 	sense	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	are	defined	with	respect	to	some	absolute	,	abstract	 not 	 ions 	 	of	 right 	 s 	 	and	justice	,	and	so	forth	,	which	are	 in 	 dependent 	 	of	what	else	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
of	who	else	there	is	,	of	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	and	so	forth	.
there	is	 al 	 so 	 	an	 omni 	 scient 	 	 observ 	 er 	 	who	 know 	 s 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	,	who	is	god	,	who	is	in	a	certain	sense	 out 	 side 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 ha 	 s 	 	no	role	in	 any 	 thing 	 	that	 happen 	 s 	 	,	but	is	in	a	certain	sense	 every 	 where 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	space	is	just	the	way	that	god	 know 	 s 	 	where	 every 	 thing 	 	is	,	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	newton	,	ok	?
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 found 	 ations 	 	of	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	,	 tradition 	 ally 	 	,	liberal	 politic 	 al 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	and	newtonian	physics	.
now	,	in	the	20th	century	we	had	a	revolution	that	was	 initi 	 ated 	 	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	20th	century	,	and	which	is	still	going	on	.
it	was	 beg 	 un 	 	with	the	 invent 	 ion 	 	of	 relat 	 ivity 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	and	 quant 	 um 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	.
and	 mer 	 ging 	 	them	together	to	make	the	final	 quant 	 um 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	of	space	and	time	and	 gravit 	 y 	 	,	is	the	 culmin 	 ation 	 	of	that	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	going	on	right	now	.
and	in	 th 	 is 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	 fix 	 ed 	 	and	absolute	.	zilch	,	ok	.
 th 	 is 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	 de 	 scribed 	 	by	 be 	 ing 	 	a	network	of	 relationship 	 s 	 	.
space	is	just	one	 a 	 spect 	 	,	so	there	's	no	meaning	to	say	 absolute 	 ly 	 	where	 some 	 thing 	 	is	.
there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	where	it	is	 relat 	 ive 	 	to	 every 	 thing 	 	else	that	is	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	network	of	 relation 	 s 	 	is	ever	-	 evolv 	 ing 	 	.
so	we	call	it	a	 relation 	 al 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
all	 proper 	 ties 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	are	about	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 relationship 	 s 	 	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	,	if	you	're	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	in	 s 	 uch 	 	a	network	of	 relationship 	 s 	 	,	your	view	of	the	world	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	with	what	information	 come 	 s 	 	to	you	through	the	network	of	 relation 	 s 	 	.
and	there	's	no	place	for	an	 omni 	 scient 	 	 observ 	 er 	 	or	an	 out 	 side 	 	 intellig 	 ence 	 	 know 	 ing 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	and	making	 every 	 thing 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	general	 relat 	 ivity 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 quant 	 um 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	,	if	you	talk	to	legal	 scholar 	 s 	 	,	the	 found 	 ations 	 	of	new	 idea 	 s 	 	in	legal	thought	.
they	're	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	same	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	not	 on 	 ly 	 	that	,	they	make	the	 analog 	 y 	 	to	 relat 	 ivity 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	and	 cosmo 	 logy 	 	often	.
so	there	's	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	 discuss 	 ion 	 	going	on	there	.
 th 	 is 	 	last	view	of	 cosmo 	 logy 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 relation 	 al 	 	view	.
so	the	main	slogan	here	is	that	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	 out 	 side 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	that	there	's	no	place	to	put	an	 explan 	 ation 	 	for	 some 	 thing 	 	 out 	 side 	 	.
so	in	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 relation 	 al 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	if	you	come	 up 	 on 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	 order 	 ed 	 	and	 structure 	 d 	 	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	here	,	or	that	 de 	 vice 	 	there	,	or	 some 	 thing 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	like	all	the	living	 thing 	 s 	 	,	all	of	you	 guy 	 s 	 	in	the	room	--	``	 guy 	 s 	 	``	in	physics	,	by	the	way	,	is	a	generic	term	:	men	and	women	.
then	you	want	to	know	,	you	're	a	person	,	you	want	to	know	how	is	it	made	.
and	in	a	 relation 	 al 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	the	 on 	 ly 	 	possible	 explan 	 ation 	 	was	,	 some 	 how 	 	it	made	 it 	 self 	 	.
there	must	be	 mechan 	 ism 	 s 	 	of	self	-	 organ 	 ization 	 	 in 	 side 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	that	make	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	no	place	to	put	a	maker	 out 	 side 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	there	was	in	the	aristotelian	and	the	newtonian	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
so	in	a	 relation 	 al 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	we	must	have	 process 	 es 	 	of	self	-	 organ 	 ization 	 	.
now	,	darwin	taught	us	that	there	are	 process 	 es 	 	of	self	-	 organ 	 ization 	 	that	 suff 	 ice 	 	to	explain	all	of	us	and	 every 	 thing 	 	we	see	.
so	it	 work 	 s 	 	.	but	not	 on 	 ly 	 	that	,	if	you	think	about	how	natural	 s 	 election 	 	 work 	 s 	 	,	then	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	natural	 s 	 election 	 	would	 on 	 ly 	 	make	sense	in	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 relation 	 al 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
that	is	,	natural	 s 	 election 	 	 work 	 s 	 	on	 proper 	 ties 	 	,	like	 fit 	 ness 	 	,	which	are	about	 relationship 	 s 	 	of	some	species	to	some	other	species	.
darwin	would	n't	make	sense	in	an	aristotelian	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	and	would	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	make	sense	in	a	newtonian	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
so	a	 theor 	 y 	 	of	biology	based	on	natural	 s 	 election 	 	 requir 	 es 	 	a	 relation 	 al 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	of	what	are	the	 proper 	 ties 	 	of	 bio 	 logical 	 	 system 	 s 	 	.
and	if	you	push	that	all	the	way	down	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	it	 make 	 s 	 	the	best	sense	in	a	 relation 	 al 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	where	all	 proper 	 ties 	 	are	 relation 	 al 	 	.
now	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	that	,	but	einstein	taught	us	that	 gravit 	 y 	 	is	the	result	of	the	world	 be 	 ing 	 	 relation 	 al 	 	.
if	it	was	n't	for	 gravit 	 y 	 	,	there	would	n't	be	life	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 gravit 	 y 	 	 cause 	 s 	 	 star 	 s 	 	to	form	and	live	for	a	 ver 	 y 	 	long	time	,	 keep 	 ing 	 	 piece 	 s 	 	of	the	world	,	like	the	surface	of	the	earth	,	out	of	thermal	equilibrium	for	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	so	life	can	evolve	.
in	the	20th	century	,	we	saw	the	 in 	 dependent 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	of	two	big	 theme 	 s 	 	in	science	.
in	the	 bio 	 logical 	 	 science 	 s 	 	,	they	 explore 	 d 	 	the	 implic 	 ations 	 	of	the	 not 	 ion 	 	that	order	and	 complex 	 ity 	 	and	structure	arise	in	a	self	-	 organize 	 d 	 	way	.
that	was	the	triumph	of	neo	-	darwinism	and	so	forth	.
and	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	,	that	idea	is	 leak 	 ing 	 	out	to	the	cognitive	 science 	 s 	 	,	the	human	 science 	 s 	 	,	 economic 	 s 	 	,	et	 ce 	 tera 	 	.
at	the	same	time	,	we	 physicist 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 bus 	 y 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	sense	of	and	build	on	and	integrate	the	 discover 	 ies 	 	of	 quant 	 um 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	and	 relat 	 ivity 	 	.
and	what	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	out	is	the	 implic 	 ations 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	of	the	idea	that	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	made	up	of	 relation 	 s 	 	.
21st	-	century	science	is	going	to	be	driven	by	the	 integ 	 ration 	 	of	these	two	 idea 	 s 	 	:	the	triumph	of	 relation 	 al 	 	ways	of	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	world	,	on	the	one	hand	,	and	self	-	 organ 	 ization 	 	or	darwinian	ways	of	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	world	,	on	the	other	hand	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	,	is	that	in	the	21st	century	our	 think 	 ing 	 	about	space	and	time	and	 cosmo 	 logy 	 	,	and	our	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 socie 	 ty 	 	are	both	going	to	 continu 	 e 	 	to	evolve	.
and	what	they	're	 evolv 	 ing 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	is	the	 un 	 ion 	 	of	these	two	big	 idea 	 s 	 	,	darwinism	and	 relation 	 al 	 ism 	 	.
now	,	if	you	think	about	 demo 	 cracy 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	a	new	 plural 	 istic 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	of	 demo 	 cracy 	 	would	be	one	that	 recogn 	 ize 	 s 	 	that	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	different	 interest 	 s 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	different	 agenda 	 s 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	different	 individual 	 s 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	different	 point 	 s 	 	of	view	.
each	one	is	 in 	 complete 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	in	a	network	of	 relationship 	 s 	 	.
any	 a 	 ctor 	 	in	a	 demo 	 cracy 	 	is	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	in	a	network	of	 relationship 	 s 	 	.
and	you	understand	some	 thing 	 s 	 	better	than	other	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	 be 	 cause 	 	of	that	there	's	a	 continu 	 al 	 	 jo 	 st 	 ling 	 	and	give	and	take	,	which	is	 politic 	 s 	 	.
and	 politic 	 s 	 	is	,	in	the	ideal	sense	,	the	way	in	which	we	 continu 	 ally 	 	address	our	network	of	 relation 	 s 	 	in	order	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	a	better	life	and	a	better	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
and	i	 al 	 so 	 	think	that	science	will	never	go	away	and	--	i	'm	 finish 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	line	.
in	fact	,	i	'm	 finish 	 ed 	 	.	science	will	never	go	away	.
