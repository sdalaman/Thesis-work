 hell 	 o 	 	,	 every 	 one 	 	.	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	first	time	at	ted	,	i	've	 decide 	 d 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	 a 	 long 	 	an	old	friend	to	help	break	the	ice	a	bit	.
 y 	 es 	 	.	that	's	right	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	barbie	.
she	's	50	 year 	 s 	 	old	.	and	she	's	looking	 a 	 s 	 	young	 a 	 s 	 	ever	.
but	i	'd	 al 	 so 	 	like	to	 introduc 	 e 	 	you	to	what	may	be	an	 un 	 familiar 	 	face	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	fulla	.	fulla	is	the	arab	world	's	answer	to	barbie	.
now	,	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	 proponent 	 s 	 	of	the	 c 	 lash 	 	of	 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	,	barbie	and	fulla	occupy	these	 complete 	 ly 	 	 separat 	 e 	 	 sphere 	 s 	 	.
they	have	different	 interest 	 s 	 	.	they	have	 diverge 	 nt 	 	 value 	 s 	 	.
and	should	they	ever	come	in	contact	...
well	,	i	've	got	to	tell	you	,	it	's	just	not	going	to	be	 pre 	 tty 	 	.
my	experience	,	 how 	 ever 	 	,	in	the	islamic	world	is	 ver 	 y 	 	different	.
where	i	work	,	in	the	arab	region	,	people	are	 bus 	 y 	 	taking	up	western	 innov 	 ations 	 	and	changing	them	 in 	 to 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	which	are	 n 	 either 	 	 convention 	 ally 	 	western	,	nor	are	they	 tradition 	 ally 	 	islamic	.
i	want	to	show	you	two	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
the	first	is	4shbab	.
it	 mean 	 s 	 	``	for	youth	``	and	it	's	a	new	arab	tv	channel	.
:	video	 clip 	 s 	 	from	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 glob 	 e 	 	.
the	usa	.
♫	i	am	not	 af 	 raid 	 	to	stand	 al 	 one 	 	♫	♫	i	am	not	 af 	 raid 	 	to	stand	 al 	 one 	 	,	if	allah	is	by	my	side	♫	♫	i	am	not	 af 	 raid 	 	to	stand	 al 	 one 	 	♫	♫	 every 	 thing 	 	will	be	all	right	♫	♫	i	am	not	 af 	 raid 	 	to	stand	 al 	 one 	 	♫	the	arab	world	.
♫	she	was	 preserve 	 d 	 	by	 modest 	 y 	 	of	the	 relig 	 ion 	 	♫	♫	she	was	 ador 	 ned 	 	by	the	light	of	the	quran	♫	shereen	el	feki	:	4shbab	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 dub 	 bed 	 	islamic	mtv	.
 it 	 s 	 	creator	,	who	is	an	egyptian	tv	 produce 	 r 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	ahmed	abu	haïba	,	 want 	 s 	 	young	people	to	be	inspired	by	islam	to	lead	better	 live 	 s 	 	.
he	 reckon 	 s 	 	the	best	way	to	get	that	 mess 	 age 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	is	to	use	the	 enormous 	 ly 	 	popular	medium	of	music	 video 	 s 	 	.
4shbab	was	set	up	 a 	 s 	 	an	 alter 	 native 	 	to	 exist 	 ing 	 	arab	music	 channel 	 s 	 	.
and	they	look	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
that	,	by	the	way	is	haifa	wehbe	.	she	's	a	lebanese	pop	star	and	pan	-	arab	pin	-	up	girl	.
in	the	world	of	4shbab	,	it	's	not	about	bump	and	grind	.
but	it	's	not	about	fire	and	 brim 	 stone 	 	either	.
 it 	 s 	 	 video 	 s 	 	are	 intend 	 ed 	 	to	show	a	 kind 	 er 	 	,	 gentle 	 r 	 	face	of	islam	,	for	young	people	to	deal	with	life	's	 challeng 	 es 	 	.
now	,	my	second	 ex 	 ample 	 	is	for	a	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 young 	 er 	 	crowd	.
and	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	99.	``
now	,	these	are	the	world	's	first	islamic	 super 	 heroes 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 create 	 d 	 	by	a	kuwaiti	 psycho 	 logist 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	naif	al	mutawa	.
and	his	 desir 	 e 	 	is	to	 rescu 	 e 	 	islam	from	 image 	 s 	 	of	 in 	 toler 	 ance 	 	,	all	in	a	child	-	friendly	format	.
``	the	99.	``	the	 character 	 s 	 	are	 me 	 ant 	 	to	 em 	 body 	 	the	99	 attribut 	 es 	 	of	allah	:	justice	,	 wis 	 dom 	 	,	 merc 	 y 	 	,	among	 other 	 s 	 	.
so	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	there	is	the	character	of	noora	.
she	is	 me 	 ant 	 	to	have	the	power	to	look	 in 	 side 	 	people	and	see	the	good	and	bad	in	 every 	 one 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	character	 call 	 ed 	 	jami	 ha 	 s 	 	the	ability	to	create	fantastic	 invent 	 ions 	 	.
now	,	``	the	99	``	is	not	just	a	 com 	 ic 	 	book	.
it	's	now	a	theme	park	.
there	is	an	 animate 	 d 	 	 s 	 eries 	 	in	the	 work 	 s 	 	.
and	by	 th 	 is 	 	time	next	year	,	the	 like 	 s 	 	of	 super 	 man 	 	and	wonder	woman	will	have	 join 	 ed 	 	 force 	 s 	 	with	``	the	99	``	to	beat	 in 	 justice 	 	 where 	 ver 	 	they	find	it	.
``	the	99	``	and	4shbab	are	just	two	of	 man 	 y 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	islamic	cross	-	cultural	 hybrid 	 ization 	 	.
we	're	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	here	about	a	 c 	 lash 	 	of	 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	.
nor	is	it	some	sort	of	 in 	 distinguish 	 able 	 	mash	.
i	like	to	think	of	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	mesh	of	 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	,	in	which	the	 strand 	 s 	 	of	different	 culture 	 s 	 	are	 intertwine 	 d 	 	.
now	,	while	4shbab	and	``	the	99	``	may	look	new	and	 shin 	 y 	 	,	there	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	long	tradition	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
 through 	 out 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	islam	 ha 	 s 	 	 borrow 	 ed 	 	and	 adapt 	 ed 	 	from	other	 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	both	ancient	and	modern	.
after	all	,	it	's	the	quran	which	 encourag 	 es 	 	us	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	:
``	we	made	you	 in 	 to 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	and	 tribe 	 s 	 	so	that	you	could	learn	from	one	 an 	 other 	 	.	``
and	to	my	mind	,	 t 	 hose 	 	are	 pre 	 tty 	 	wise	 word 	 s 	 	,	no	matter	what	your	 cre 	 ed 	 	.	thank	you	.
