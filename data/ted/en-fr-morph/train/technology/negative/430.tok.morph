what	i	thought	i	would	talk	about	 to 	 day 	 	is	the	 transit 	 ion 	 	from	one	mode	of	 think 	 ing 	 	about	nature	to	 an 	 other 	 	that	's	 track 	 ed 	 	by	 architect 	 ure 	 	.
what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	about	 architect 	 s 	 	is	,	we	 al 	 ways 	 	have	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	 just 	 ify 	 	 beaut 	 y 	 	by	looking	to	nature	,	and	 argu 	 ably 	 	,	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 architect 	 ure 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	looking	at	a	model	of	nature	.
so	,	for	 rough 	 ly 	 	300	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	hot	debate	in	 architect 	 ure 	 	was	 whet 	 her 	 	the	number	five	or	the	number	seven	was	a	better	proportion	to	think	about	 architect 	 ure 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	nose	was	one	-	fifth	of	your	head	,	or	 be 	 cause 	 	your	head	was	one	-	 seven 	 th 	 	of	your	body	.
and	the	reason	that	that	was	the	model	of	 beaut 	 y 	 	and	of	nature	was	 be 	 cause 	 	the	decimal	point	had	not	 be 	 en 	 	 invent 	 ed 	 	yet	--	it	was	n't	the	16th	century	--	and	 every 	 body 	 	had	to	dimension	a	building	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 fraction 	 s 	 	,	so	a	room	would	be	 dimension 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	one	-	fourth	of	a	facade	;	the	structural	 dai 	 s 	 	of	that	might	be	 dimension 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	10	 unit 	 s 	 	,	and	you	would	get	down	to	the	small	 element 	 s 	 	by	 fraction 	 al 	 	 sub 	 division 	 	:	 fin 	 er 	 	and	 fin 	 er 	 	and	 fin 	 er 	 	.
in	the	15th	century	,	the	decimal	point	was	 invent 	 ed 	 	;	 architect 	 s 	 	 stop 	 ped 	 	using	 fraction 	 s 	 	,	and	they	had	a	new	model	of	nature	.
so	,	what	's	going	on	 to 	 day 	 	is	that	there	's	a	model	of	natural	form	which	is	 calcul 	 us 	 	-	based	and	which	is	using	digital	 tool 	 s 	 	,	and	that	 ha 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	 implic 	 ations 	 	to	the	way	we	think	about	 beaut 	 y 	 	and	form	,	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	 implic 	 ations 	 	in	the	way	we	think	about	nature	.
the	best	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	would	 prob 	 ably 	 	be	the	 got 	 hic 	 	,	and	the	 got 	 hic 	 	was	 invent 	 ed 	 	after	the	 invent 	 ion 	 	of	 calcul 	 us 	 	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	the	 got 	 hic 	 	 architect 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	using	 calcul 	 us 	 	to	define	 the 	 ir 	 	 form 	 s 	 	.
but	what	was	 import 	 ant 	 	is	,	the	 got 	 hic 	 	moment	in	 architect 	 ure 	 	was	the	first	time	that	force	and	motion	was	thought	of	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	form	.
so	,	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	like	christopher	wren	's	king	's	cross	:	you	can	see	that	the	structural	 force 	 s 	 	of	the	 vault 	 ing 	 	get	 articulate 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	lines	,	so	you	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	the	 express 	 ion 	 	of	structural	force	and	form	.

so	,	in	all	of	these	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	,	structure	is	the	 determi 	 ning 	 	force	.
frei	otto	was	 start 	 ing 	 	to	use	foam	bubble	 dia 	 gram 	 s 	 	and	foam	bubble	 model 	 s 	 	to	generate	his	mannheim	concert	hall	.

in	all	these	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	,	there	's	one	ideal	form	,	 be 	 cause 	 	these	are	thought	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	structure	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	an	architect	,	i	've	 al 	 ways 	 	found	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 system 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 limit 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	not	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	ideal	 form 	 s 	 	and	i	'm	not	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 optim 	 izing 	 	to	some	perfect	moment	.
so	,	what	i	thought	i	would	 br 	 ing 	 	up	is	 an 	 other 	 	component	that	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	thought	of	,	 when 	 ever 	 	you	think	about	nature	,	and	that	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	the	 invent 	 ion 	 	of	generic	form	in	genetic	evolution	.
my	hero	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	not	darwin	;	it	's	a	guy	named	william	bateson	,	father	of	greg	bateson	,	who	was	here	for	a	long	time	in	monterey	.
and	he	was	what	you	'd	call	a	 tera 	 to 	 logist 	 	:	he	 look 	 ed 	 	at	all	of	the	 monstr 	 os 	 ities 	 	and	 mutation 	 s 	 	to	find	 rule 	 s 	 	and	 law 	 s 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	looking	at	the	 norm 	 s 	 	.
so	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 try 	 ing 	 	to	find	the	ideal	type	or	the	ideal	average	,	he	'd	 al 	 ways 	 	look	for	the	exception	.	so	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	which	is	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	bateson	's	rule	,	he	 ha 	 s 	 	two	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 mutation 	 s 	 	of	a	human	thumb	.
when	i	first	saw	 th 	 is 	 	image	,	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	found	it	 ver 	 y 	 	strange	and	 beaut 	 iful 	 	at	the	same	time	.
 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	symmetry	.
so	,	what	he	found	is	that	in	all	 case 	 s 	 	of	thumb	 mutation 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	thumb	,	you	would	either	get	 an 	 other 	 	 oppos 	 able 	 	thumb	,	or	you	would	get	four	 finger 	 s 	 	.	so	,	the	 mutation 	 s 	 	 re 	 vert 	 ed 	 	to	symmetry	.
and	bateson	 invent 	 ed 	 	the	 con 	 cept 	 	of	symmetry	 break 	 ing 	 	,	which	is	that	 where 	 ver 	 	you	lose	information	in	a	system	,	you	 re 	 vert 	 	back	to	symmetry	.
so	,	symmetry	was	n't	the	sign	of	order	and	 organ 	 ization 	 	--	which	is	what	i	was	 al 	 ways 	 	 understand 	 ing 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	is	an	architect	--	symmetry	was	the	 ab 	 s 	 ence 	 	of	information	.
so	,	 when 	 ever 	 	you	lost	information	,	you	'd	move	to	symmetry	;	 when 	 ever 	 	you	 add 	 ed 	 	information	to	a	system	,	you	would	break	symmetry	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	whole	idea	of	natural	form	 shift 	 ed 	 	at	that	moment	from	looking	for	ideal	 shape 	 s 	 	to	looking	for	a	combination	of	information	and	generic	form	.
you	know	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	after	 see 	 ing 	 	that	image	,	and	 find 	 ing 	 	out	what	bateson	was	 work 	 ing 	 	with	,	we	 start 	 ed 	 	to	use	these	 rule 	 s 	 	for	symmetry	 break 	 ing 	 	and	 branch 	 ing 	 	to	start	to	think	about	 architect 	 ural 	 	form	.
to	just	talk	for	a	minute	about	the	digital	 medium 	 s 	 	that	we	're	using	now	and	how	they	integrate	 calcul 	 us 	 	:	the	fact	that	they	're	 calcul 	 us 	 	-	based	 mean 	 s 	 	that	we	do	n't	have	to	think	about	dimension	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	ideal	 unit 	 s 	 	or	discreet	 element 	 s 	 	.
so	,	in	 architect 	 ure 	 	we	deal	with	big	 assem 	 bli 	 es 	 	of	 component 	 s 	 	,	so	there	might	be	up	to	,	say	,	50,000	 piece 	 s 	 	of	material	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	you	're	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	right	now	that	all	need	to	get	 organize 	 d 	 	.
now	,	 typical 	 ly 	 	you	'd	think	that	they	would	all	be	the	same	:	like	,	the	 chair 	 s 	 	you	're	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	would	all	be	the	same	dimension	.
you	know	,	i	have	n't	 ver 	 ified 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	it	's	the	norm	that	every	chair	would	be	a	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	different	dimension	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	'd	want	to	space	them	all	out	for	 every 	 body 	 	's	sight	lines	.
the	 element 	 s 	 	that	make	up	the	 ceil 	 ing 	 	grid	and	the	 light 	 ing 	 	,	they	're	all	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	modular	quality	,	and	moving	more	and	more	to	these	 infinite 	 s 	 im 	 al 	 	 dimension 	 s 	 	.
that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	all	using	 calcul 	 us 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	for	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	and	for	design	.
 calcul 	 us 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	a	 mathematic 	 s 	 	of	 curv 	 es 	 	.	so	,	even	a	straight	line	,	defined	with	 calcul 	 us 	 	,	is	a	 curv 	 e 	 	.
it	's	just	a	 curv 	 e 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 inf 	 le 	 ction 	 	.
so	,	a	new	 vocabul 	 ary 	 	of	form	is	now	 pervad 	 ing 	 	all	design	 field 	 s 	 	:	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	 auto 	 mobile 	 s 	 	,	 architect 	 ure 	 	,	 product 	 s 	 	,	etc	.	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 affect 	 ed 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	digital	medium	of	 curv 	 ature 	 	.
the	 intric 	 acies 	 	of	scale	that	come	out	of	that	--	you	know	,	in	the	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	the	nose	to	the	face	,	there	's	a	 fraction 	 al 	 	part	-	to	-	whole	idea	.
with	 calcul 	 us 	 	,	the	whole	idea	of	 sub 	 division 	 	is	more	complex	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	whole	and	the	 part 	 s 	 	are	one	 continu 	 ous 	 	 s 	 eries 	 	.
it	's	too	early	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	for	a	 lectur 	 e 	 	on	 calcul 	 us 	 	,	so	i	 br 	 ought 	 	some	 image 	 s 	 	to	just	 de 	 scribe 	 	how	that	 work 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	korean	church	that	we	did	in	 que 	 en 	 s 	 	.
and	in	 th 	 is 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	you	can	see	that	the	 component 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	stair	are	 repetit 	 ive 	 	,	but	they	're	 repetit 	 ive 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	modular	.
each	one	of	the	 element 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	structure	is	a	 un 	 ique 	 	distance	and	dimension	,	and	all	of	the	 connect 	 ions 	 	are	 un 	 ique 	 	 angle 	 s 	 	.
now	,	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	we	could	design	that	,	or	possibly	construct	it	,	is	by	using	a	 calcul 	 us 	 	-	based	definition	of	the	form	.
it	 al 	 so 	 	is	much	more	dynamic	,	so	that	you	can	see	that	the	same	form	 open 	 s 	 	and	 close 	 s 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	dynamic	way	 a 	 s 	 	you	move	 a 	 cross 	 	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	quality	of	vector	in	motion	built	 in 	 to 	 	it	.
so	the	same	space	that	 appear 	 s 	 	to	be	a	kind	of	closed	volume	,	when	 s 	 een 	 	from	the	other	side	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	open	vista	.
and	you	 al 	 so 	 	get	a	sense	of	visual	 move 	 ment 	 	in	the	space	,	 be 	 cause 	 	every	one	of	the	 element 	 s 	 	is	changing	in	a	pattern	,	so	that	pattern	 lead 	 s 	 	your	eye	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	 al 	 tar 	 	.
i	think	that	's	one	of	the	main	 change 	 s 	 	,	 al 	 so 	 	,	in	 architect 	 ure 	 	:	that	we	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	look	now	not	for	some	ideal	form	,	like	a	latin	cross	for	a	church	,	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	all	the	 trait 	 s 	 	of	a	church	:	so	,	light	that	 come 	 s 	 	from	 be 	 hind 	 	from	an	 in 	 visible 	 	source	,	 direction 	 ality 	 	that	 focus 	 es 	 	you	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	an	 al 	 tar 	 	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	it	's	not	rocket	science	to	design	a	sacred	space	.
you	just	need	to	 in 	 corporate 	 	a	certain	number	of	 trait 	 s 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	kind	of	genetic	way	.
so	,	these	are	the	different	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 s 	 	of	that	 in 	 terior 	 	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	complex	set	of	 orient 	 ations 	 	all	in	a	simple	form	.
in	 term 	 s 	 	of	construction	and	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	kilometer	-	long	housing	block	that	was	built	in	the	'70s	in	amsterdam	.
and	here	we	've	broken	the	500	 a 	 part 	 ments 	 	up	 in 	 to 	 	small	 neighbor 	 hood 	 s 	 	,	and	 different 	 iated 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 neighbor 	 hood 	 s 	 	.
i	wo	n't	go	 in 	 to 	 	too	much	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	of	any	of	these	 project 	 s 	 	,	but	what	you	can	see	is	that	the	 escal 	 ators 	 	and	 elev 	 ators 	 	that	 circul 	 ate 	 	people	 a 	 long 	 	the	face	of	the	building	are	all	held	up	by	122	structural	 tru 	 s 	 s 	 es 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	using	 escal 	 ators 	 	to	move	people	,	all	of	these	 tru 	 s 	 s 	 es 	 	are	 pick 	 ing 	 	up	diagonal	 load 	 s 	 	.
so	,	every	one	of	them	is	a	little	bit	different	-	shaped	 a 	 s 	 	you	move	down	the	length	of	the	building	.
so	,	 work 	 ing 	 	with	bentley	and	microstation	,	we	've	written	a	custom	piece	of	 soft 	 ware 	 	that	 network 	 s 	 	all	of	the	 component 	 s 	 	together	 in 	 to 	 	these	 chunk 	 s 	 	of	information	,	so	that	if	we	change	any	element	 a 	 long 	 	the	length	of	the	building	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 do 	 es 	 	that	change	 distribut 	 e 	 	through	each	one	of	the	 tru 	 s 	 s 	 es 	 	,	but	each	one	of	the	 tru 	 s 	 s 	 es 	 	then	 distribut 	 es 	 	that	information	down	the	length	of	the	entire	facade	of	the	building	.	so	it	's	a	single	 calcul 	 ation 	 	for	every	single	component	of	the	building	that	we	're	 add 	 ing 	 	onto	.
so	,	it	's	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	 calcul 	 ations 	 	just	to	design	one	 connect 	 ion 	 	between	a	piece	of	structural	steel	and	 an 	 other 	 	piece	of	structural	steel	.
but	what	it	 give 	 s 	 	us	is	a	 harmon 	 ic 	 	and	 synthesize 	 d 	 	relationship	of	all	these	 component 	 s 	 	,	one	to	 an 	 other 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	idea	 ha 	 s 	 	,	kind	of	,	 br 	 ought 	 	me	 in 	 to 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	some	product	design	,	and	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	design	 firm 	 s 	 	that	have	 connect 	 ions 	 	to	 architect 	 s 	 	,	like	,	i	'm	 work 	 ing 	 	with	vitra	,	which	is	a	furniture	company	,	and	alessi	,	which	is	a	 house 	 ware 	 	company	.
they	saw	 th 	 is 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	solving	a	problem	:	 th 	 is 	 	ability	to	 different 	 iate 	 	 component 	 s 	 	but	keep	them	synthetic	.
so	,	not	to	pick	on	bmw	,	or	to	 celebr 	 ate 	 	them	,	but	take	bmw	 a 	 s 	 	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
they	have	to	,	in	2005	,	have	a	distinct	 ident 	 ity 	 	for	all	 the 	 ir 	 	 model 	 s 	 	of	 car 	 s 	 	.
so	,	the	300	 s 	 eries 	 	,	or	 what 	 ever 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 new 	 est 	 	car	is	,	the	100	 s 	 eries 	 	that	's	coming	out	,	 ha 	 s 	 	to	look	like	the	700	 s 	 eries 	 	,	at	the	other	end	of	 the 	 ir 	 	product	line	,	so	they	need	a	distinct	,	 cohere 	 nt 	 	 ident 	 ity 	 	,	which	is	bmw	.
at	the	same	time	,	there	's	a	person	 pay 	 ing 	 	30,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	for	a	300	-	 s 	 eries 	 	car	,	and	a	person	 pay 	 ing 	 	70,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	for	a	700	 s 	 eries 	 	,	and	that	person	 pay 	 ing 	 	more	than	double	 do 	 es 	 	n't	want	 the 	 ir 	 	car	to	look	too	much	like	the	bottom	-	of	-	the	-	market	car	.
so	they	have	to	 al 	 so 	 	discriminate	between	these	 product 	 s 	 	.
so	,	 a 	 s 	 	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	 start 	 s 	 	to	allow	more	design	 option 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	problem	 get 	 s 	 	 exacerbate 	 d 	 	,	of	the	whole	and	the	 part 	 s 	 	.
now	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	architect	,	part	-	to	-	whole	 relationship 	 s 	 	is	all	i	think	about	,	but	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	product	design	it	's	 be 	 coming 	 	more	and	more	of	an	issue	for	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.
so	,	the	first	kind	of	test	product	we	did	was	with	alessi	,	which	was	for	a	coffee	and	tea	set	.
it	's	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	expensive	coffee	and	tea	set	;	we	 k 	 new 	 	that	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	.	so	,	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	went	to	some	people	i	 k 	 new 	 	down	south	in	san	diego	,	and	we	used	an	 explode 	 d 	 	 titan 	 ium 	 	 form 	 ing 	 	method	that	's	used	in	the	 aero 	 space 	 	industry	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	what	we	can	do	,	is	just	cut	a	 graph 	 ite 	 	mold	,	put	it	in	an	oven	,	heat	it	to	1,000	 degree 	 s 	 	,	 gent 	 ly 	 	 infla 	 te 	 	 titan 	 ium 	 	that	's	soft	,	and	then	explode	it	at	the	last	minute	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	form	.
but	what	's	great	about	it	is	,	the	 form 	 s 	 	are	 on 	 ly 	 	a	few	hundred	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
the	 titan 	 ium 	 	's	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	thousand	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	but	the	 form 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	cheap	.
so	,	we	designed	a	system	here	of	eight	 curv 	 es 	 	that	could	be	 swap 	 ped 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	to	that	housing	project	i	 show 	 ed 	 	you	,	and	we	could	 re 	 combine 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	together	,	so	that	we	 al 	 ways 	 	had	 er 	 go 	 nomic 	 	 shape 	 s 	 	that	 al 	 ways 	 	had	the	same	volume	and	could	 al 	 ways 	 	be	 produce 	 d 	 	in	the	same	way	.
that	way	,	each	one	of	these	 tool 	 s 	 	we	could	pay	for	with	a	few	hundred	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	and	get	 in 	 credible 	 	 vari 	 ation 	 	in	the	 component 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	the	 set 	 s 	 	.
so	,	for	me	,	what	was	 import 	 ant 	 	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	coffee	set	--	which	is	just	a	coffee	pot	,	a	teapot	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	 pot 	 s 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	on	a	tray	--	that	they	would	have	a	 cohere 	 nce 	 	--	so	,	they	would	be	greg	lynn	alessi	coffee	 pot 	 s 	 	--	but	that	 every 	 one 	 	who	 b 	 ought 	 	one	would	have	a	one	-	of	-	a	-	kind	object	that	was	 un 	 ique 	 	in	some	way	.
to	go	back	to	 architect 	 ure 	 	,	what	's	 organ 	 ic 	 	about	 architect 	 ure 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	field	,	 un 	 like 	 	product	design	,	is	 th 	 is 	 	whole	issue	of	 hol 	 ism 	 	and	of	 monument 	 ality 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	our	realm	.	like	,	we	have	to	design	 thing 	 s 	 	which	are	 cohere 	 nt 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	single	object	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	break	down	 in 	 to 	 	small	rooms	and	have	an	 ident 	 ity 	 	of	both	the	big	scale	and	the	small	scale	.
 architect 	 s 	 	tend	to	work	with	signature	,	so	that	an	architect	 need 	 s 	 	a	signature	and	that	signature	 ha 	 s 	 	to	work	 a 	 cross 	 	the	scale	of	 house 	 s 	 	up	to	,	say	,	 sky 	 scrap 	 ers 	 	,	and	that	problem	of	 signature 	 s 	 	is	a	thing	we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	good	at	 maintain 	 ing 	 	and	 work 	 ing 	 	with	;	and	 intric 	 acy 	 	,	which	is	the	relationship	of	,	say	,	the	shape	of	a	building	,	 it 	 s 	 	structure	,	 it 	 s 	 	 window 	 s 	 	,	 it 	 s 	 	color	,	 it 	 s 	 	pattern	.	these	are	real	 architect 	 ural 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	.
so	,	my	kind	of	hero	for	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	natural	world	are	these	 tropic 	 al 	 	 frog 	 s 	 	.
i	got	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	them	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	the	most	 extrem 	 e 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	a	surface	where	the	 text 	 ure 	 	and	the	--	let	's	call	it	the	 decor 	 ation 	 	--	i	know	the	frog	 do 	 es 	 	n't	think	of	it	 a 	 s 	 	 decor 	 ation 	 	,	but	that	's	how	it	 work 	 s 	 	--	are	all	 intric 	 ate 	 ly 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	one	 an 	 other 	 	.
so	a	change	in	the	form	 indic 	 ates 	 	a	change	in	the	color	pattern	.
so	,	the	pattern	and	the	form	are	n't	the	same	thing	,	but	they	 re 	 ally 	 	work	together	and	are	fused	in	some	way	.
so	,	when	 do 	 ing 	 	a	center	for	the	national	 park 	 s 	 	in	costa	rica	,	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	use	that	idea	of	a	 grad 	 ient 	 	color	and	a	change	in	 text 	 ure 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	structure	 move 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	surface	of	the	building	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	used	a	 continu 	 ity 	 	of	change	from	a	main	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	hall	to	a	natural	 histo 	 ry 	 	museum	,	so	it	's	all	one	 continu 	 ous 	 	change	in	the	 mass 	 ing 	 	,	but	 with 	 in 	 	that	 mass 	 ing 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 space 	 s 	 	and	 form 	 s 	 	.
in	a	housing	project	in	valencia	,	spain	,	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	,	the	different	 tower 	 s 	 	of	housing	fused	together	in	 share 	 d 	 	 curv 	 es 	 	so	you	get	a	single	mass	,	like	a	kind	of	monolith	,	but	it	 break 	 s 	 	down	 in 	 to 	 	individual	 element 	 s 	 	.
and	you	can	see	that	that	change	in	 mass 	 ing 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 give 	 s 	 	all	48	of	the	 a 	 part 	 ments 	 	a	 un 	 ique 	 	shape	and	 s 	 ize 	 	,	but	 al 	 ways 	 	 with 	 in 	 	a	,	kind	of	,	controlled	limit	,	an	 envelop 	 e 	 	of	change	.
i	work	with	a	group	of	other	 architect 	 s 	 	.
we	have	a	company	 call 	 ed 	 	 unit 	 ed 	 	 architect 	 s 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	one	of	the	 final 	 ists 	 	for	the	world	trade	center	 s 	 ite 	 	design	.
and	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	just	 show 	 s 	 	how	we	 we 	 re 	 	 approach 	 ing 	 	the	problem	of	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	large	-	scale	construction	.
we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	make	a	kind	of	 got 	 hic 	 	 cat 	 hedral 	 	around	the	 foot 	 print 	 s 	 	of	the	world	trade	center	 s 	 ite 	 	.
and	to	do	that	,	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	connect	up	the	five	 tower 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	single	system	.
and	we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	,	from	the	1950s	on	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	 nume 	 r 	 ous 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	other	 architect 	 s 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	the	same	thing	.
we	 re 	 ally 	 	 approach 	 ed 	 	it	at	the	level	of	the	 typo 	 logy 	 	of	the	building	,	where	we	could	build	these	five	 separat 	 e 	 	 tower 	 s 	 	,	but	they	would	all	join	at	the	60th	floor	and	make	a	kind	of	single	 monolith 	 ic 	 	mass	.
with	 unit 	 ed 	 	 architect 	 s 	 	,	 al 	 so 	 	,	we	made	a	proposal	for	the	european	central	bank	 head 	 quarter 	 s 	 	that	used	the	same	system	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	time	in	a	much	more	 monolith 	 ic 	 	mass	,	like	a	sphere	.
but	 aga 	 in 	 	,	you	can	see	 th 	 is 	 	,	kind	of	,	 organ 	 ic 	 	fusion	of	 multi 	 ple 	 	building	 element 	 s 	 	to	make	a	thing	which	is	whole	,	but	 break 	 s 	 	down	 in 	 to 	 	 small 	 er 	 	 part 	 s 	 	,	but	in	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 organ 	 ic 	 	way	.
 final 	 ly 	 	,	i	'd	like	to	just	show	you	some	of	the	 effect 	 s 	 	of	using	digital	 fabric 	 ation 	 	.
about	six	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	 b 	 ought 	 	one	of	these	cnc	 mill 	 s 	 	,	to	just	replace	,	kind	of	,	young	people	cutting	 the 	 ir 	 	 finger 	 s 	 	off	all	the	time	building	 model 	 s 	 	.
and	i	 al 	 so 	 	 b 	 ought 	 	a	laser	cutter	and	 start 	 ed 	 	to	 fabric 	 ate 	 	 with 	 in 	 	my	own	shop	,	kind	of	,	large	-	scale	building	 element 	 s 	 	and	 model 	 s 	 	,	where	we	could	go	 direct 	 ly 	 	to	the	 tool 	 ing 	 	.
what	i	found	out	is	that	the	 tool 	 ing 	 	,	if	you	 inter 	 vene 	 d 	 	in	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	 produce 	 d 	 	 decor 	 ative 	 	 effect 	 s 	 	.
so	,	for	these	 in 	 terior 	 s 	 	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	shop	in	stockholm	,	sweden	,	or	 th 	 is 	 	 install 	 ation 	 	wall	in	the	netherlands	at	the	netherlands	 architect 	 ure 	 	institute	,	we	could	use	the	 text 	 ure 	 	that	the	tool	would	 leav 	 e 	 	to	produce	a	lot	of	the	spatial	 effect 	 s 	 	,	and	we	could	integrate	the	 text 	 ure 	 	of	the	wall	with	the	form	of	the	wall	with	the	material	.
so	,	in	vacuum	-	 form 	 ed 	 	plastic	,	in	 fiber 	 glass 	 	,	and	then	even	at	the	level	of	structural	steel	,	which	you	think	of	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	linear	and	modular	.
the	steel	industry	is	so	far	 a 	 head 	 	of	the	design	industry	that	if	you	take	advantage	of	it	you	can	even	start	to	think	of	 beam 	 s 	 	and	 column 	 s 	 	all	 roll 	 ed 	 	together	 in 	 to 	 	a	single	system	which	is	 high 	 ly 	 	efficient	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 produce 	 s 	 	 decor 	 ative 	 	 effect 	 s 	 	and	 form 	 al 	 	 effect 	 s 	 	that	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	and	 organ 	 ic 	 	.
 thank 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
