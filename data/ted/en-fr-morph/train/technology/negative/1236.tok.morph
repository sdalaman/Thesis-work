the	night	before	i	was	 head 	 ing 	 	for	scotland	,	i	was	 invit 	 ed 	 	to	host	the	final	of	``	 chin 	 a 	 	's	got	talent	``	show	in	shanghai	with	the	80,000	live	audience	in	the	 stad 	 ium 	 	.
guess	who	was	the	 perform 	 ing 	 	guest	?
susan	boyle	.
and	i	told	her	,	``	i	'm	going	to	scotland	the	next	day	.	``
she	 s 	 ang 	 	 beaut 	 i 	 fully 	 	,	and	she	even	 manage 	 d 	 	to	say	a	few	 word 	 s 	 	in	chinese	:	送你葱	so	it	's	not	like	``	 hell 	 o 	 	``	or	``	thank	you	,	``	that	 ordin 	 ary 	 	stuff	.
it	 mean 	 s 	 	``	green	 on 	 ion 	 	for	free	.	``
why	did	she	say	that	?
 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	a	line	from	our	chinese	parallel	susan	boyle	--	a	50	-	some	year	-	old	woman	,	a	 veget 	 able 	 	 vend 	 or 	 	in	shanghai	,	who	 love 	 s 	 	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	western	opera	,	but	she	did	n't	understand	any	english	or	french	or	italian	,	so	she	 manage 	 d 	 	to	fill	in	the	 lyric 	 s 	 	with	 veget 	 able 	 	 name 	 s 	 	in	chinese	.
and	the	last	sentence	of	nessun	dorma	that	she	was	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	in	the	 stad 	 ium 	 	was	``	green	 on 	 ion 	 	for	free	.	``
so	[	 a 	 s 	 	]	susan	boyle	was	 say 	 ing 	 	that	,	80,000	live	audience	 s 	 ang 	 	together	.
that	was	hilarious	.
so	i	guess	both	susan	boyle	and	 th 	 is 	 	 veget 	 able 	 	 vend 	 or 	 	in	shanghai	 belong 	 ed 	 	to	 other 	 ness 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	the	 l 	 east 	 	 expect 	 ed 	 	to	be	 success 	 ful 	 	in	the	business	 call 	 ed 	 	 entertain 	 ment 	 	,	yet	 the 	 ir 	 	courage	and	talent	 br 	 ought 	 	them	through	.
and	a	show	and	a	platform	 g 	 ave 	 	them	the	stage	to	 real 	 ize 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 dream 	 s 	 	.
well	,	 be 	 ing 	 	different	is	not	that	difficult	.
we	are	all	different	from	different	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 s 	 	.
but	i	think	 be 	 ing 	 	different	is	good	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	present	a	different	point	of	view	.
you	may	have	the	chance	to	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
my	generation	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	fortunate	to	witness	and	 particip 	 ate 	 	in	the	historic	 transform 	 ation 	 	of	 chin 	 a 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	made	so	 man 	 y 	 	 change 	 s 	 	in	the	past	20	,	30	 year 	 s 	 	.
i	remember	that	in	the	year	of	1990	,	when	i	was	 gradu 	 ating 	 	from	college	,	i	was	 app 	 ly 	 ing 	 	for	a	job	in	the	 sale 	 s 	 	 depart 	 ment 	 	of	the	first	five	-	star	hotel	in	beijing	,	great	wall	sheraton	--	it	's	still	there	.
so	after	 be 	 ing 	 	 interrog 	 ated 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	japanese	 manage 	 r 	 	for	a	half	an	hour	,	he	 final 	 ly 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	so	,	 mis 	 s 	 	 y 	 ang 	 	,	do	you	have	any	 question 	 s 	 	to	ask	me	?	``	i	 summon 	 ed 	 	my	courage	and	poise	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	but	could	you	let	me	know	,	what	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	you	sell	?	``	i	did	n't	have	a	clue	what	a	 sale 	 s 	 	 depart 	 ment 	 	was	about	in	a	five	-	star	hotel	.
that	was	the	first	day	i	set	my	foot	in	a	five	-	star	hotel	.
around	the	same	time	,	i	was	going	through	an	audition	--	the	first	ever	open	audition	by	national	 tele 	 vision 	 	in	 chin 	 a 	 	--	with	 an 	 other 	 	thousand	college	 girl 	 s 	 	.
the	 produce 	 r 	 	told	us	they	 we 	 re 	 	looking	for	some	sweet	,	 innoc 	 ent 	 	and	 beaut 	 iful 	 	fresh	face	.
so	when	it	was	my	turn	,	i	stood	up	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	why	[	do	]	women	's	 personal 	 ities 	 	on	 tele 	 vision 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	have	to	be	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	sweet	,	 innoc 	 ent 	 	and	,	you	know	,	 support 	 ive 	 	?
why	ca	n't	they	have	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 idea 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	own	voice	?	``	i	thought	i	kind	of	 offend 	 ed 	 	them	.
but	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 impress 	 ed 	 	by	my	 word 	 s 	 	.
and	so	i	was	in	the	second	round	of	 com 	 petition 	 	,	and	then	the	third	and	the	fourth	.
after	seven	 round 	 s 	 	of	 com 	 petition 	 	,	i	was	the	last	one	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	it	.
so	i	was	on	a	national	 tele 	 vision 	 	prime	-	time	show	.
and	 believ 	 e 	 	it	or	not	,	that	was	the	first	show	on	chinese	 tele 	 vision 	 	that	 allow 	 ed 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 host 	 s 	 	to	speak	out	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 mind 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 read 	 ing 	 	an	approved	script	.
and	my	 week 	 ly 	 	audience	at	that	time	was	between	200	to	300	million	people	.
well	after	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	go	to	the	u.s.	and	columbia	university	to	pursue	my	 post 	 graduate 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	,	and	then	 start 	 ed 	 	my	own	media	company	,	which	was	 un 	 thought 	 	of	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	 year 	 s 	 	that	i	 start 	 ed 	 	my	 care 	 er 	 	.
so	we	do	a	lot	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
i	've	 interview 	 ed 	 	more	than	a	thousand	people	in	the	past	.
and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	i	have	young	people	 approach 	 ing 	 	me	say	,	``	lan	,	you	 change 	 d 	 	my	life	,	``	and	i	feel	proud	of	that	.
but	then	we	are	 al 	 so 	 	so	fortunate	to	witness	the	 transform 	 ation 	 	of	the	whole	country	.
i	was	in	beijing	's	 bid 	 d 	 ing 	 	for	the	olympic	 game 	 s 	 	.
i	was	 represent 	 ing 	 	the	shanghai	expo	.
i	saw	 chin 	 a 	 	 em 	 bracing 	 	the	world	and	vice	versa	.
but	then	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	i	'm	 think 	 ing 	 	,	what	are	 to 	 day 	 	's	young	generation	up	to	?
how	are	they	different	,	and	what	are	the	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	they	are	going	to	make	to	shape	the	future	of	 chin 	 a 	 	,	or	at	large	,	the	world	?
so	 to 	 day 	 	i	want	to	talk	about	young	people	through	the	platform	of	social	media	.
first	of	all	,	who	are	they	?	[	what	]	do	they	look	like	?
well	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	girl	 call 	 ed 	 	guo	meimei	--	20	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
she	 show 	 ed 	 	off	her	expensive	 bag 	 s 	 	,	 clothe 	 s 	 	and	car	on	her	 micro 	 blog 	 	,	which	is	the	chinese	version	of	twitter	.
and	she	 claim 	 ed 	 	to	be	the	general	 manage 	 r 	 	of	red	cross	at	the	chamber	of	commerce	.
she	did	n't	 real 	 ize 	 	that	she	 steppe 	 d 	 	on	a	sensitive	nerve	and	 arouse 	 d 	 	national	 question 	 ing 	 	,	 al 	 most 	 	a	turmoil	,	against	the	 cr 	 ed 	 ibility 	 	of	red	cross	.
the	 contr 	 over 	 s 	 y 	 	was	so	heated	that	the	red	cross	had	to	open	a	press	 con 	 ference 	 	to	 clar 	 ify 	 	it	,	and	the	investigation	is	going	on	.
so	far	,	 a 	 s 	 	of	 to 	 day 	 	,	we	know	that	she	 her 	 self 	 	made	up	that	title	--	 prob 	 ably 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	she	 feel 	 s 	 	proud	to	be	 associate 	 d 	 	with	 char 	 ity 	 	.
all	 t 	 hose 	 	expensive	 item 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 give 	 n 	 	to	her	 a 	 s 	 	 gift 	 s 	 	by	her	boyfriend	,	who	used	to	be	a	board	member	in	a	 sub 	 division 	 	of	red	cross	at	chamber	of	commerce	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	to	explain	.
but	 any 	 way 	 	,	the	public	still	 do 	 es 	 	n't	buy	it	.
it	is	still	 boil 	 ing 	 	.
it	 show 	 s 	 	us	a	general	 mis 	 trust 	 	of	government	or	government	-	 back 	 ed 	 	 institution 	 s 	 	,	which	 lack 	 ed 	 	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	in	the	past	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	it	 show 	 ed 	 	us	the	power	and	the	impact	of	social	media	 a 	 s 	 	 micro 	 blog 	 	.
 micro 	 blog 	 	 boom 	 ed 	 	in	the	year	of	2010	,	with	 visit 	 ors 	 	 double 	 d 	 	and	time	 s 	 pent 	 	on	it	 triple 	 d 	 	.
sina.com	,	a	major	news	 port 	 al 	 	,	 al 	 one 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	more	than	140	million	 micro 	 blogger 	 s 	 	.
on	tencent	,	200	million	.
the	most	popular	blogger	--	it	's	not	me	--	it	's	a	movie	star	,	and	she	 ha 	 s 	 	more	than	9.5	million	 follow 	 ers 	 	,	or	 fan 	 s 	 	.
about	80	percent	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 micro 	 blogger 	 s 	 	are	young	people	,	under	30	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	know	,	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	media	is	still	 heav 	 ily 	 	controlled	by	the	government	,	social	media	 off 	 ers 	 	an	 open 	 ing 	 	to	let	the	 s 	 team 	 	out	a	little	bit	.
but	 be 	 cause 	 	you	do	n't	have	 man 	 y 	 	other	 open 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	the	heat	coming	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	 open 	 ing 	 	is	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	,	active	and	even	violent	.
so	through	 micro 	 b 	 logging 	 	,	we	are	able	to	understand	chinese	youth	even	better	.
so	how	are	they	different	?
first	of	all	,	most	of	them	 we 	 re 	 	born	in	the	80s	and	90s	,	under	the	one	-	child	policy	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 select 	 ed 	 	 abort 	 ion 	 	by	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	who	 favor 	 ed 	 	 boy 	 s 	 	to	 girl 	 s 	 	,	now	we	have	 end 	 ed 	 	up	with	30	million	more	young	men	than	women	.
that	could	pose	a	potential	danger	to	the	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	but	who	 know 	 s 	 	;	we	're	in	a	 global 	 ized 	 	world	,	so	they	can	look	for	 girlfriend 	 s 	 	from	other	 count 	 ries 	 	.
most	of	them	have	 fair 	 ly 	 	good	education	.
the	 il 	 liter 	 acy 	 	rate	in	 chin 	 a 	 	among	 th 	 is 	 	generation	is	under	one	percent	.
in	cities	,	80	percent	of	 kid 	 s 	 	go	to	college	.
but	they	are	facing	an	aging	 chin 	 a 	 	with	a	population	above	65	 year 	 s 	 	old	coming	up	with	seven	-	point	-	some	percent	 th 	 is 	 	year	,	and	about	to	be	15	percent	by	the	year	of	2030	.
and	you	know	we	have	the	tradition	that	 young 	 er 	 	 generation 	 s 	 	support	the	 elder 	 s 	 	 financial 	 ly 	 	,	and	taking	care	of	them	when	they	're	sick	.
so	it	 mean 	 s 	 	young	 couple 	 s 	 	will	have	to	support	four	 parent 	 s 	 	who	have	a	life	 expect 	 ancy 	 	of	73	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
so	making	a	living	is	not	that	easy	for	young	people	.
college	 graduate 	 s 	 	are	not	in	short	supply	.
in	urban	 area 	 s 	 	,	college	 graduate 	 s 	 	find	the	 start 	 ing 	 	 s 	 al 	 ary 	 	is	about	400	u.s.	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	month	,	while	the	average	rent	is	above	$	500	.
so	what	do	they	do	?	they	have	to	share	space	--	 squeez 	 ed 	 	in	 ver 	 y 	 	 limit 	 ed 	 	space	to	 s 	 ave 	 	money	--	and	they	call	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	``	tribe	of	ants	.	``
and	for	 t 	 hose 	 	who	are	ready	to	get	married	and	buy	 the 	 ir 	 	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	,	they	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	they	have	to	work	for	30	to	40	 year 	 s 	 	to	afford	 the 	 ir 	 	first	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	.
that	ratio	in	america	would	 on 	 ly 	 	cost	a	couple	five	 year 	 s 	 	to	earn	,	but	in	 chin 	 a 	 	it	's	30	to	40	 year 	 s 	 	with	the	 skyrocket 	 ing 	 	real	 e 	 state 	 	price	.
among	the	200	million	migrant	 work 	 ers 	 	,	60	percent	of	them	are	young	people	.
they	find	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	sort	of	 sandwich 	 ed 	 	between	the	urban	 area 	 s 	 	and	the	 r 	 ural 	 	 area 	 s 	 	.
most	of	them	do	n't	want	to	go	back	to	the	 country 	 side 	 	,	but	they	do	n't	have	the	sense	of	 belong 	 ing 	 	.
they	work	for	 long 	 er 	 	 hour 	 s 	 	with	less	income	,	less	social	 wel 	 fare 	 	.
and	they	're	more	 vulner 	 able 	 	to	job	 loss 	 es 	 	,	subject	to	 infla 	 tion 	 	,	 tight 	 en 	 ing 	 	 loan 	 s 	 	from	 bank 	 s 	 	,	 appreci 	 ation 	 	of	the	renminbi	,	or	decline	of	demand	from	europe	or	america	for	the	 product 	 s 	 	they	produce	.
last	year	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	an	 app 	 all 	 ing 	 	incident	in	a	southern	oem	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	 com 	 pound 	 	in	 chin 	 a 	 	:	13	young	 work 	 ers 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	late	 teen 	 s 	 	and	early	20s	 commit 	 ted 	 	 su 	 icide 	 	,	just	one	by	one	like	 caus 	 ing 	 	a	 con 	 tag 	 ious 	 	disease	.
but	they	 di 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	all	different	personal	 reason 	 s 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	whole	incident	 arouse 	 d 	 	a	huge	 out 	 cry 	 	from	 socie 	 ty 	 	about	the	 isol 	 ation 	 	,	both	physical	and	mental	,	of	these	migrant	 work 	 ers 	 	.
for	 t 	 hose 	 	who	do	return	back	to	the	 country 	 side 	 	,	they	find	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	welcome	 local 	 ly 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	with	the	knowledge	,	 skill 	 s 	 	and	 network 	 s 	 	they	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	in	the	cities	,	with	the	 assist 	 ance 	 	of	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	they	're	able	to	create	more	 job 	 s 	 	,	 up 	 grade 	 	local	 agricultur 	 e 	 	and	create	new	business	in	the	less	 develop 	 ed 	 	market	.
so	for	the	past	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	 coast 	 al 	 	 area 	 s 	 	,	they	found	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	a	 short 	 age 	 	of	labor	.
these	 dia 	 gram 	 s 	 	show	a	more	general	social	 back 	 ground 	 	.
the	first	one	is	the	engels	 co 	 efficient 	 	,	which	 explain 	 s 	 	that	the	cost	of	 dai 	 ly 	 	 necess 	 ities 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 drop 	 ped 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 percent 	 age 	 	all	through	the	past	decade	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	family	income	,	to	about	37	-	some	percent	.
but	then	in	the	last	two	 year 	 s 	 	,	it	 go 	 es 	 	up	 aga 	 in 	 	to	39	percent	,	 indic 	 ating 	 	a	 ris 	 ing 	 	living	cost	.
the	gini	 co 	 efficient 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	 pass 	 ed 	 	the	 danger 	 ous 	 	line	of	0.4	.
now	it	's	0.5	--	even	 wo 	 rse 	 	than	that	in	america	--	 show 	 ing 	 	us	the	income	 ine 	 quality 	 	.
and	so	you	see	 th 	 is 	 	whole	 socie 	 ty 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 frust 	 rated 	 	about	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	some	of	 it 	 s 	 	 mobil 	 ity 	 	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	,	the	 bitter 	 ness 	 	and	even	 resent 	 ment 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	rich	and	the	 power 	 ful 	 	is	 quit 	 e 	 	 wide 	 spread 	 	.
so	any	 accus 	 ations 	 	of	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	or	 back 	 door 	 	 deal 	 ing 	 s 	 	between	 author 	 ities 	 	or	business	would	arouse	a	social	 out 	 cry 	 	or	even	 un 	 rest 	 	.
so	through	some	of	the	 hot 	 test 	 	 top 	 ic 	 s 	 	on	 micro 	 b 	 logging 	 	,	we	can	see	what	young	people	care	most	about	.
social	justice	and	government	 account 	 ability 	 	 run 	 s 	 	the	first	in	what	they	demand	.
for	the	past	decade	or	so	,	a	massive	 urban 	 ization 	 	and	 develop 	 ment 	 	have	let	us	witness	a	lot	of	 report 	 s 	 	on	the	 force 	 d 	 	 demo 	 lit 	 ion 	 	of	private	 proper 	 ty 	 	.
and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 arouse 	 d 	 	huge	anger	and	 frust 	 ration 	 	among	our	young	generation	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	people	get	 kill 	 ed 	 	,	and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	people	set	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	on	fire	to	protest	.
so	when	these	 incident 	 s 	 	are	 report 	 ed 	 	more	and	more	 frequent 	 ly 	 	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	people	cry	for	the	government	to	take	 action 	 s 	 	to	stop	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	the	good	news	is	that	 ear 	 lier 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	,	the	state	council	 pass 	 ed 	 	a	new	 regulat 	 ion 	 	on	house	 re 	 qui 	 s 	 ition 	 	and	 demo 	 lit 	 ion 	 	and	 pass 	 ed 	 	the	right	to	order	 force 	 d 	 	 demo 	 lit 	 ion 	 	from	local	 government 	 s 	 	to	the	court	.
 similar 	 ly 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	other	 issue 	 s 	 	 concern 	 ing 	 	public	 safe 	 ty 	 	is	a	hot	 top 	 ic 	 	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
we	heard	about	 pollute 	 d 	 	air	,	 pollute 	 d 	 	water	,	 poison 	 ed 	 	food	.
and	guess	what	,	we	have	 fak 	 ed 	 	beef	.
they	have	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	that	you	brush	on	a	piece	of	chicken	or	fish	,	and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	it	to	look	like	beef	.
and	then	 late 	 ly 	 	,	people	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	 cook 	 ing 	 	oil	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	have	 be 	 en 	 	found	[	 re 	 fin 	 ing 	 	]	 cook 	 ing 	 	oil	from	restaurant	slop	.
so	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	have	 arouse 	 d 	 	a	huge	 out 	 cry 	 	from	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
and	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	we	have	 s 	 een 	 	the	government	 respond 	 ing 	 	more	 time 	 ly 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	more	 frequent 	 ly 	 	to	the	public	 concern 	 s 	 	.
while	young	people	seem	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 particip 	 ation 	 	in	public	policy	-	making	,	but	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	they	're	a	little	bit	lost	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	what	they	want	for	 the 	 ir 	 	personal	life	.
 chin 	 a 	 	is	soon	to	pass	the	u.s.	 a 	 s 	 	the	number	one	market	for	 luxur 	 y 	 	 brand 	 s 	 	--	that	's	not	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	the	chinese	 expend 	 iture 	 s 	 	in	europe	and	 else 	 where 	 	.
but	you	know	what	,	half	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 consumer 	 s 	 	are	 earn 	 ing 	 	a	 s 	 al 	 ary 	 	 be 	 low 	 	2,000	u.s.	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
they	're	not	rich	at	all	.
they	're	taking	 t 	 hose 	 	 bag 	 s 	 	and	 clothe 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	sense	of	 ident 	 ity 	 	and	social	 stat 	 us 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	girl	 ex 	 plicit 	 ly 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	on	a	tv	 d 	 ating 	 	show	that	she	would	 ra 	 ther 	 	cry	in	a	bmw	than	 s 	 mile 	 	on	a	 bi 	 cycle 	 	.
but	of	course	,	we	do	have	young	people	who	would	still	prefer	to	 s 	 mile 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	in	a	bmw	or	[	on	]	a	 bi 	 cycle 	 	.
so	in	the	next	picture	,	you	see	a	 ver 	 y 	 	popular	 phenomen 	 on 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	``	naked	``	 wed 	 d 	 ing 	 	,	or	``	naked	``	marriage	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	not	mean	they	will	wear	 noth 	 ing 	 	in	the	 wed 	 d 	 ing 	 	,	but	it	 show 	 s 	 	that	these	young	 couple 	 s 	 	are	ready	to	get	married	 with 	 out 	 	a	house	,	 with 	 out 	 	a	car	,	 with 	 out 	 	a	diamond	ring	and	 with 	 out 	 	a	 wed 	 d 	 ing 	 	banquet	,	to	show	 the 	 ir 	 	 commit 	 ment 	 	to	true	love	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	,	people	are	 do 	 ing 	 	good	through	social	media	.
and	the	first	picture	 show 	 ed 	 	us	that	a	truck	 c 	 aging 	 	500	 home 	 less 	 	and	 kidnap 	 ped 	 	 dog 	 s 	 	for	food	 process 	 ing 	 	was	 spot 	 ted 	 	and	 stop 	 ped 	 	on	the	 high 	 way 	 	with	the	whole	country	 watch 	 ing 	 	through	 micro 	 b 	 logging 	 	.
people	 we 	 re 	 	 don 	 ating 	 	money	,	dog	food	and	 off 	 er 	 ing 	 	volunteer	work	to	stop	that	truck	.
and	after	 hour 	 s 	 	of	 negoti 	 ation 	 	,	500	 dog 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 rescu 	 ed 	 	.
and	here	 al 	 so 	 	people	are	 help 	 ing 	 	to	find	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	children	.
a	father	 post 	 ed 	 	his	son	's	picture	onto	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
after	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 re 	 s 	 end 	 s 	 	in	 re 	 lay 	 	,	the	child	was	found	,	and	we	 witness 	 ed 	 	the	 re 	 un 	 ion 	 	of	the	family	through	 micro 	 b 	 logging 	 	.
so	happiness	is	the	most	popular	word	we	have	heard	through	the	past	two	 year 	 s 	 	.
happiness	is	not	 on 	 ly 	 	related	to	personal	 experience 	 s 	 	and	personal	 value 	 s 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	,	it	's	about	the	environment	.
people	are	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	 question 	 s 	 	:	are	we	going	to	sacrifice	our	environment	further	to	produce	 high 	 er 	 	gdp	?
how	are	we	going	to	perform	our	social	and	 politic 	 al 	 	reform	to	keep	pace	with	economic	growth	,	to	keep	 sustain 	 ability 	 	and	 st 	 ability 	 	?
and	 al 	 so 	 	,	how	 cap 	 able 	 	is	the	system	of	self	-	 correct 	 ness 	 	to	keep	more	people	content	with	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	friction	going	on	at	the	same	time	?
i	guess	these	are	the	 question 	 s 	 	people	are	going	to	answer	.
and	our	 young 	 er 	 	generation	are	going	to	transform	 th 	 is 	 	country	while	at	the	same	time	 be 	 ing 	 	 transform 	 ed 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
