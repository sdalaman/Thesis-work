so	,	what	i	'd	like	to	talk	about	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	was	 ver 	 y 	 	dear	to	kahn	's	heart	,	which	is	:	how	do	we	discover	what	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	about	a	project	?
how	do	you	discover	the	 un 	 ique 	 ness 	 	of	a	project	 a 	 s 	 	 un 	 ique 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	person	?	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	that	 find 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 un 	 ique 	 ness 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	with	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	the	whole	force	of	 global 	 ization 	 	;	that	the	 part 	 icular 	 	is	central	to	 find 	 ing 	 	the	 un 	 ique 	 ness 	 	of	place	and	the	 un 	 ique 	 ness 	 	of	a	program	in	a	building	.
and	so	i	'll	take	you	to	wichita	,	kansas	,	where	i	was	 ask 	 ed 	 	some	 year 	 s 	 	ago	to	do	a	science	museum	on	a	 s 	 ite 	 	,	right	 down 	 town 	 	by	the	river	.
and	i	thought	the	secret	of	the	 s 	 ite 	 	was	to	make	the	building	of	the	river	,	part	of	the	river	.	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	the	 s 	 ite 	 	was	 separat 	 ed 	 	from	the	river	by	mclean	boulevard
so	i	 suggest 	 ed 	 	,	``	let	's	 re 	 route 	 	mclean	,	``
and	that	 g 	 ave 	 	birth	 instant 	 ly 	 	to	 friend 	 s 	 	of	mclean	boulevard	.	and	it	took	six	 month 	 s 	 	to	 re 	 route 	 	it	.
the	first	image	i	 show 	 ed 	 	the	building	 commit 	 tee 	 	was	 th 	 is 	 	astronomic	 observ 	 atory 	 	of	jantar	mantar	in	jaipur	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	what	 make 	 s 	 	a	building	a	building	of	science	.
and	it	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	me	that	 th 	 is 	 	structure	--	complex	,	rich	and	yet	 total 	 ly 	 	rational	:	it	's	an	instrument	--	had	 some 	 thing 	 	to	do	with	science	,	and	 some 	 how 	 	a	building	for	science	should	be	different	and	 un 	 ique 	 	and	speak	of	that	.
and	so	my	first	sketch	after	i	left	was	to	say	,	``	let	's	cut	the	channel	and	make	an	 is 	 land 	 	and	make	an	 is 	 land 	 	building	.	``
and	i	got	all	 excit 	 ed 	 	and	came	back	,	and	they	sort	of	 look 	 ed 	 	at	me	in	 dis 	 may 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	an	 is 	 land 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	used	to	be	an	 is 	 land 	 	--	ackerman	 is 	 land 	 	--	and	we	 fill 	 ed 	 	in	the	channel	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	 depress 	 ion 	 	to	create	 job 	 s 	 	.	``
and	so	the	process	 beg 	 an 	 	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	ca	n't	put	it	all	on	an	 is 	 land 	 	;	some	of	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	on	the	 main 	 land 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	do	n't	want	to	turn	our	back	to	the	community	.	``
and	there	 emerge 	 d 	 	a	design	:	the	 gall 	 eries 	 	sort	of	 form 	 ing 	 	an	 is 	 land 	 	and	you	could	walk	through	them	or	on	the	roof	.	and	there	 we 	 re 	 	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 excit 	 ing 	 	 feature 	 s 	 	:	you	could	come	in	through	the	landside	 building 	 s 	 	,	walk	through	the	 gall 	 eries 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 play 	 ground 	 s 	 	in	the	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	.
if	you	 we 	 re 	 	cheap	you	could	walk	on	top	of	a	bridge	to	the	roof	,	peek	in	the	 exhibit 	 s 	 	and	then	get	 total 	 ly 	 	 seduce 	 d 	 	,	come	back	and	pay	the	five	 dollar 	 s 	 	 ad 	 mission 	 	.
and	the	client	was	happy	--	well	,	sort	of	happy	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	four	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	over	the	budget	,	but	 essential 	 ly 	 	happy	.
but	i	was	still	 trouble 	 d 	 	,	and	i	was	 trouble 	 d 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	felt	 th 	 is 	 	was	 capric 	 ious 	 	.
it	was	complex	,	but	there	was	 some 	 thing 	 	 capric 	 ious 	 	about	 it 	 s 	 	 complex 	 ity 	 	.
it	was	,	what	i	would	say	,	 com 	 position 	 al 	 	 complex 	 ity 	 	,	and	i	felt	that	if	i	had	to	fulfill	what	i	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	--	a	building	for	science	--	there	had	to	be	some	kind	of	a	generating	idea	,	some	kind	of	a	generating	 geo 	 metry 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	birth	to	the	idea	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	toroidal	generating	 geo 	 metry 	 	,	one	with	 it 	 s 	 	center	deep	in	the	earth	for	the	landside	building	and	a	toroid	with	 it 	 s 	 	center	in	the	sky	for	the	 is 	 land 	 	building	.
a	toroid	,	for	 t 	 hose 	 	who	do	n't	know	,	is	the	surface	of	a	 dough 	 nut 	 	or	,	for	some	of	us	,	a	 bag 	 el 	 	.
and	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	idea	 start 	 ed 	 	 s 	 pinning 	 	off	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 vari 	 ations 	 	of	different	 plan 	 s 	 	and	 possibil 	 ities 	 	,	and	then	the	plan	 it 	 self 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	in	relationship	to	the	 exhibit 	 s 	 	,	and	you	see	the	 intersect 	 ion 	 	of	the	plan	with	the	toroidal	 geo 	 metry 	 	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	the	building	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	model	.
and	when	there	 we 	 re 	 	 complain 	 ts 	 	about	budget	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	it	's	worth	 do 	 ing 	 	the	 is 	 land 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	you	get	twice	for	your	money	:	 reflect 	 ions 	 	.	``
and	here	's	the	building	 a 	 s 	 	it	 open 	 ed 	 	,	with	a	channel	 overlook 	 ing 	 	 down 	 town 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	 s 	 een 	 	from	 down 	 town 	 	.	and	the	bike	route	's	going	right	through	the	building	,	so	 t 	 hose 	 	 travel 	 ing 	 	the	river	would	see	the	 exhibit 	 s 	 	and	be	drawn	to	the	building	.
the	toroidal	 geo 	 metry 	 	made	for	a	 ver 	 y 	 	efficient	building	:
every	beam	in	 th 	 is 	 	building	is	the	same	 radi 	 us 	 	,	all	laminated	wood	.
every	wall	,	every	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	wall	is	 resist 	 ing 	 	the	 stress 	 es 	 	and	 support 	 ing 	 	the	building	.
every	piece	of	the	building	 work 	 s 	 	.
these	are	the	 gall 	 eries 	 	with	the	light	coming	in	through	the	 sky 	 light 	 s 	 	,	and	at	night	,	and	on	 open 	 ing 	 	day	.
going	back	to	1976	.	in	1976	,	i	was	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	design	a	children	's	memorial	museum	in	a	 holo 	 caus 	 t 	 	museum	in	yad	vashem	in	jerusalem	,	which	you	see	here	the	campus	.
i	was	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	do	a	building	,	and	i	was	 give 	 n 	 	all	the	 artifact 	 s 	 	of	 cloth 	 ing 	 	and	 draw 	 ing 	 s 	 	.	and	i	felt	 ver 	 y 	 	 trouble 	 d 	 	.	i	 work 	 ed 	 	on	it	for	 month 	 s 	 	and	i	could	n't	deal	with	it	 be 	 cause 	 	i	felt	people	 we 	 re 	 	coming	out	of	the	historic	museum	,	they	are	 total 	 ly 	 	 saturate 	 d 	 	with	information	and	to	see	yet	 an 	 other 	 	museum	with	information	,	it	would	make	them	just	 un 	 able 	 	to	digest	.
and	so	i	made	a	counter	-	proposal	:
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	building	.	``	there	was	a	cave	on	the	 s 	 ite 	 	;	we	tunnel	 in 	 to 	 	the	hill	,	descend	through	the	rock	 in 	 to 	 	an	 under 	 ground 	 	chamber	.
there	's	an	anteroom	with	 photograph 	 s 	 	of	children	who	 perish 	 ed 	 	and	then	you	come	 in 	 to 	 	a	large	space	.
there	is	a	single	candle	 flick 	 er 	 ing 	 	in	the	center	;
by	an	 arrange 	 ment 	 	of	 reflect 	 ive 	 	 glass 	 es 	 	,	it	 reflect 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 in 	 fin 	 ity 	 	in	all	 direction 	 s 	 	.
you	walk	through	the	space	,	a	voice	 read 	 s 	 	the	 name 	 s 	 	,	 age 	 s 	 	and	place	of	birth	of	the	children	.
 th 	 is 	 	voice	 do 	 es 	 	not	repeat	for	six	 month 	 s 	 	.
and	then	you	descend	to	light	and	to	the	north	and	to	life	.
well	,	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	people	wo	n't	understand	,	they	'll	think	it	's	a	 dis 	 co 	 the 	 que 	 	.	you	ca	n't	do	that	.	``
and	they	shelved	the	project	.	and	it	 s 	 at 	 	there	for	10	 year 	 s 	 	,
and	then	one	day	abe	spiegel	from	los	angeles	,	who	had	lost	his	three	-	year	-	old	son	at	auschwitz	,	came	,	saw	the	model	,	wrote	the	check	and	it	got	built	10	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
so	,	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	after	that	in	1998	,	i	was	on	one	of	my	 month 	 ly 	 	 trip 	 s 	 	to	jerusalem	and	i	got	a	call	from	the	foreign	 mini 	 stry 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	we	've	got	the	chief	 mini 	 ster 	 	of	the	punjab	here	.
he	is	on	a	state	visit	.	we	took	him	on	a	visit	to	yad	vashem	,
we	took	him	to	the	children	's	memorial	;	he	was	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 move 	 d 	 	.
he	's	 demand 	 ing 	 	to	meet	the	architect	.	could	you	come	down	and	meet	him	in	tel	aviv	?	``
and	i	went	down	and	chief	 mini 	 ster 	 	badal	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	``	we	sikhs	have	 suffer 	 ed 	 	a	great	deal	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	have	jews	.
i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 move 	 d 	 	by	what	i	saw	 to 	 day 	 	.
we	are	going	to	build	our	national	museum	to	tell	the	story	of	our	people	;	we	're	about	to	embark	on	that	.
i	'd	like	you	to	come	and	design	it	.	``
and	so	,	you	know	,	it	's	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	do	n't	take	too	 serious 	 ly 	 	.
but	two	 week 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	i	was	in	 th 	 is 	 	little	town	,	anandpur	sahib	,	 out 	 side 	 	chandigarh	,	the	capital	of	the	punjab	,	and	the	temple	and	 al 	 so 	 	next	to	it	the	fortress	that	the	last	guru	of	the	sikhs	,	guru	gobind	,	 di 	 ed 	 	in	 a 	 s 	 	he	wrote	the	khalsa	,	which	is	 the 	 ir 	 	holy	 script 	 ure 	 	.
and	i	got	to	work	and	they	took	me	 some 	 where 	 	down	there	,	nine	 kilometer 	 s 	 	away	from	the	town	and	the	temple	,	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	that	's	where	we	have	 chose 	 n 	 	the	location	.	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	just	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	any	sense	.
the	pilgrims	come	here	by	the	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	--	they	're	not	going	to	get	in	 truck 	 s 	 	and	 bus 	 es 	 	and	go	down	there	.
let	's	get	back	to	the	town	and	walk	to	the	 s 	 ite 	 	.	``
and	i	 recommend 	 ed 	 	they	do	it	right	there	,	on	that	hill	and	 th 	 is 	 	hill	,	and	bridge	all	the	way	 in 	 to 	 	the	town	.
and	,	 a 	 s 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	are	a	little	 eas 	 ier 	 	in	india	,	the	 s 	 ite 	 	was	 purchase 	 d 	 	 with 	 in 	 	a	week	and	we	 we 	 re 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	.
and	my	proposal	was	to	split	the	museum	 in 	 to 	 	two	--	the	permanent	 exhibit 	 s 	 	at	one	end	,	the	 audit 	 orium 	 	,	library	,	and	changing	 exhibit 	 ions 	 	on	the	other	--
to	flood	the	 val 	 ley 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	water	 garden 	 s 	 	and	to	link	it	all	to	the	fort	and	to	the	 down 	 town 	 	.
and	the	 structure 	 s 	 	rise	from	the	sand	 cliff 	 s 	 	--
they	're	built	in	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	and	sandstones	;	the	 roof 	 s 	 	are	 stain 	 less 	 	steel	--
they	are	facing	south	and	 reflect 	 ing 	 	light	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	temple	 it 	 self 	 	,	 pedestrian 	 s 	 	crisscross	from	one	side	to	the	other	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	come	from	the	north	,	it	is	all	 mason 	 ry 	 	growing	out	of	the	sand	 cliff 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	come	from	the	himalayas	and	 evo 	 king 	 	the	tradition	of	the	fortress	.
and	then	i	went	away	for	four	 month 	 s 	 	and	there	was	going	to	be	 ground 	 break 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	came	back	and	,	lo	and	 be 	 hold 	 	,	the	little	model	i	'd	left	 be 	 hind 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	built	ten	 time 	 s 	 	 big 	 ger 	 	for	public	 dis 	 play 	 	on	 s 	 ite 	 	and	...	the	bridge	was	built	!
 with 	 in 	 	the	 work 	 ing 	 	 draw 	 ing 	 s 	 	!
and	half	a	million	people	 gather 	 ed 	 	for	the	 celebr 	 ations 	 	;	you	can	see	them	on	the	 s 	 ite 	 	 it 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 found 	 ations 	 	are	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
i	was	 re 	 named 	 	safdie	singh	.	and	there	it	is	under	construction	;	there	are	1,800	 work 	 ers 	 	at	work	and	it	will	be	 finish 	 ed 	 	in	two	 year 	 s 	 	.
back	to	yad	vashem	three	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.	after	all	 th 	 is 	 	episode	 beg 	 an 	 	,	yad	vashem	 decide 	 d 	 	to	 re 	 build 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	the	historic	museum	 be 	 cause 	 	now	washington	was	built	--	the	 holo 	 caus 	 t 	 	museum	in	washington	--	and	that	museum	is	so	much	more	 comprehens 	 ive 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	information	.
and	yad	vashem	 need 	 s 	 	to	deal	with	three	million	 visit 	 ors 	 	a	year	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	.
they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	let	's	 re 	 build 	 	the	museum	.	``
but	of	course	,	the	sikhs	might	give	you	a	job	on	a	platter	--	the	jews	make	it	hard	:
 inter 	 national 	 	 com 	 petition 	 	,	phase	one	,	phase	two	,	phase	three	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	i	felt	kind	of	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	with	the	 not 	 ion 	 	that	a	building	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	washington	building	--	50,000	square	feet	--	will	 s 	 it 	 	on	that	fragile	hill	and	that	we	will	go	 in 	 to 	 	 gall 	 eries 	 	--	rooms	with	 door 	 s 	 	and	sort	of	familiar	rooms	--	to	tell	the	story	of	the	 holo 	 caus 	 t 	 	.
and	i	 pro 	 posed 	 	that	we	cut	through	the	mountain	.	that	was	my	first	sketch	.	just	cut	the	whole	museum	through	the	mountain	--	enter	from	one	side	of	the	mountain	,	come	out	on	the	other	side	of	the	mountain	--
and	then	 br 	 ing 	 	light	through	the	mountain	 in 	 to 	 	the	 chamber 	 s 	 	.
and	here	you	see	the	model	:	a	 re 	 ception 	 	building	and	some	 under 	 ground 	 	 park 	 ing 	 	.
you	cross	a	bridge	,	you	enter	 th 	 is 	 	 tri 	 angular 	 	room	,	60	feet	high	,	which	 cut 	 s 	 	right	 in 	 to 	 	the	hill	and	 extend 	 s 	 	right	through	 a 	 s 	 	you	go	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	north	.	and	all	of	it	,	then	,	all	the	 gall 	 eries 	 	are	 under 	 ground 	 	,
and	you	see	the	 open 	 ing 	 s 	 	for	the	light	.
and	at	night	,	just	one	line	of	light	 cut 	 s 	 	through	the	mountain	,	which	is	a	skylight	on	top	of	that	triangle	.
and	all	the	 gall 	 eries 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	move	through	them	and	so	on	,	are	 be 	 low 	 	grade	.
and	there	are	 chamber 	 s 	 	 carv 	 ed 	 	in	the	rock	--	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	 wall 	 s 	 	,	stone	,	the	natural	rock	when	possible	--	with	the	light	 shaft 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	spanish	 quar 	 ry 	 	,	which	sort	of	inspired	the	kind	of	 space 	 s 	 	that	these	 gall 	 eries 	 	could	be	.
and	then	,	coming	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	north	,	it	 open 	 s 	 	up	:	it	 burst 	 s 	 	out	of	the	mountain	 in 	 to 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	a	view	of	light	and	of	the	city	and	of	the	jerusalem	 hill 	 s 	 	.
i	'd	like	to	conclude	with	a	project	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	for	two	 month 	 s 	 	.
it	's	the	 head 	 quarter 	 s 	 	for	the	institute	of	peace	in	washington	,	the	u.s.	institute	of	peace	.
the	 s 	 ite 	 	 chose 	 n 	 	is	 a 	 cross 	 	from	the	lincoln	memorial	;	you	see	it	there	 direct 	 ly 	 	on	the	mall	.	it	's	the	last	building	on	the	mall	,
on	access	of	the	roosevelt	bridge	that	 come 	 s 	 	in	from	virginia	.
that	too	was	a	 com 	 petition 	 	,	and	it	is	 some 	 thing 	 	i	'm	just	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	work	on	.
but	one	 recogn 	 ized 	 	the	kind	of	 un 	 ique 	 ness 	 	of	the	 s 	 ite 	 	.
if	it	 we 	 re 	 	to	be	 any 	 where 	 	in	washington	,	it	would	be	an	 off 	 ice 	 	building	,	a	 con 	 ference 	 	center	,	a	place	for	 negoti 	 ating 	 	peace	and	so	on	--	all	of	which	the	building	is	--
but	by	virtue	of	the	choice	of	 put 	 ting 	 	it	on	the	mall	and	by	the	lincoln	memorial	,	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	the	structure	that	is	the	symbol	of	peace	on	the	mall	.
and	that	was	a	lot	of	heat	to	deal	with	.
the	first	sketch	 recogn 	 ize 	 s 	 	that	the	building	is	 man 	 y 	 	 space 	 s 	 	--	 space 	 s 	 	where	research	 go 	 es 	 	on	,	 con 	 ference 	 	 center 	 s 	 	,	a	public	building	 be 	 cause 	 	it	will	be	a	museum	 devote 	 d 	 	to	peacemaking	--
and	these	are	the	 draw 	 ing 	 s 	 	that	we	 submit 	 ted 	 	for	the	 com 	 petition 	 	,	the	 plan 	 s 	 	 show 	 ing 	 	the	 space 	 s 	 	which	radiate	 out 	 ward 	 s 	 	from	the	entry	.
you	see	the	structure	 a 	 s 	 	,	in	the	sequence	of	 structure 	 s 	 	on	the	mall	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 trans 	 parent 	 	and	 invit 	 ing 	 	and	looking	in	.
and	then	 a 	 s 	 	you	enter	it	 aga 	 in 	 	,	looking	in	all	 direction 	 s 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	city	.
and	what	i	felt	about	that	building	is	that	it	 re 	 ally 	 	was	a	building	that	had	to	do	with	a	 light 	 ness 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	--	to	quote	kundera	--	that	it	had	to	do	with	whiteness	,	it	had	to	do	with	a	certain	dynamic	quality	and	it	had	to	do	with	 optim 	 ism 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	it	is	;	it	's	sort	of	 evolv 	 ing 	 	.
 stud 	 ies 	 	for	the	structure	of	the	roof	,	which	 demand 	 s 	 	 may 	 be 	 	new	 material 	 s 	 	:	how	to	make	it	white	,	how	to	make	it	 trans 	 lu 	 cent 	 	,	how	to	make	it	 glow 	 ing 	 	,	how	to	make	it	not	 capric 	 ious 	 	.
and	here	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	,	in	three	 dimension 	 s 	 	,	how	to	give	some	kind	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	of	order	,	a	structure	;	not	 some 	 thing 	 	you	feel	you	could	just	change	 be 	 cause 	 	you	stop	the	design	of	that	 part 	 icular 	 	process	.
and	so	it	 go 	 es 	 	.
i	'd	like	to	conclude	by	 say 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	...	i	'd	like	to	conclude	by	 relat 	 ing 	 	all	of	what	i	've	 s 	 aid 	 	to	the	term	``	 beaut 	 y 	 	.	``
and	i	know	it	is	not	a	 fashion 	 able 	 	term	these	 day 	 s 	 	,	and	 certain 	 ly 	 	not	 fashion 	 able 	 	in	the	 dis 	 course 	 	of	 architect 	 ural 	 	 school 	 s 	 	,
but	it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	that	all	 th 	 is 	 	,	in	one	way	or	the	other	,	is	a	search	for	 beaut 	 y 	 	.
 beaut 	 y 	 	in	the	most	 pro 	 found 	 	sense	of	fit	.	i	have	a	quote	that	i	like	by	a	morphologist	,	1917	,	theodore	cook	,	who	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 beaut 	 y 	 	 con 	 note 	 s 	 	 human 	 ity 	 	.
we	call	a	natural	object	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	see	that	 it 	 s 	 	form	 express 	 es 	 	 fit 	 ness 	 	,	the	perfect	 fulfill 	 ment 	 	of	function	.	``
well	,	i	would	have	 s 	 aid 	 	the	perfect	 fulfill 	 ment 	 	of	purpose	.
 never 	 the 	 less 	 	,	 beaut 	 y 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	kind	of	fit	;	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 tell 	 s 	 	us	that	all	the	 force 	 s 	 	that	have	to	do	with	our	natural	environment	have	 be 	 en 	 	 fulfill 	 ed 	 	--	and	our	human	environment	--	for	that	.
twenty	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	in	a	 con 	 ference 	 	richard	and	i	 we 	 re 	 	at	together	,	i	wrote	a	poem	,	which	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	to	still	hold	for	me	 to 	 day 	 	.
``	he	who	 seek 	 s 	 	truth	 s 	 hall 	 	find	 beaut 	 y 	 	.	he	who	 seek 	 s 	 	 beaut 	 y 	 	 s 	 hall 	 	find	 van 	 ity 	 	.
he	who	 seek 	 s 	 	order	 s 	 hall 	 	find	 grat 	 ification 	 	.
he	who	 seek 	 s 	 	 grat 	 ification 	 	 s 	 hall 	 	be	 disappoint 	 ed 	 	.
he	who	 consider 	 s 	 	 him 	 self 	 	the	 serv 	 ant 	 	of	his	fellow	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	 s 	 hall 	 	find	the	joy	of	self	-	 express 	 ion 	 	.	he	who	 seek 	 s 	 	self	-	 express 	 ion 	 	 s 	 hall 	 	fall	 in 	 to 	 	the	pit	of	 arrog 	 ance 	 	.
 arrog 	 ance 	 	is	 in 	 compatible 	 	with	nature	.
through	nature	,	the	nature	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	and	the	nature	of	man	,	we	 s 	 hall 	 	seek	truth	.	if	we	seek	truth	,	we	 s 	 hall 	 	find	 beaut 	 y 	 	.	``
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
