how	can	i	speak	in	10	 minute 	 s 	 	about	the	 bond 	 s 	 	of	women	over	three	 generation 	 s 	 	,	about	how	the	 astonish 	 ing 	 	strength	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 bond 	 s 	 	took	hold	in	the	life	of	a	four	-	year	-	old	girl	 huddl 	 ed 	 	with	her	young	sister	,	her	mother	and	her	 grand 	 mother 	 	for	five	 day 	 s 	 	and	 night 	 s 	 	in	a	small	boat	in	the	 chin 	 a 	 	sea	more	than	30	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 bond 	 s 	 	that	took	hold	in	the	life	of	that	small	girl	and	never	let	go	--	that	small	girl	now	living	in	san	francisco	and	 s 	 peaking 	 	to	you	 to 	 day 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	 finish 	 ed 	 	story	.
it	is	a	 jig 	 saw 	 	 puzzl 	 e 	 	still	 be 	 ing 	 	put	together	.
let	me	tell	you	about	some	of	the	 piece 	 s 	 	.
imagine	the	first	piece	:	a	man	 burn 	 ing 	 	his	life	's	work	.
he	is	a	poet	,	a	playwright	,	a	man	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	whole	life	had	 be 	 en 	 	 balanc 	 ed 	 	on	the	single	hope	of	his	country	's	 un 	 ity 	 	and	 free 	 dom 	 	.
imagine	him	 a 	 s 	 	the	communists	enter	_UNK_	,	 confront 	 ing 	 	the	fact	that	his	life	had	 be 	 en 	 	a	complete	waste	.
 word 	 s 	 	,	for	so	long	his	 friend 	 s 	 	,	now	 mock 	 ed 	 	him	.
he	 re 	 treat 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	silence	.
he	 di 	 ed 	 	broken	by	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
he	is	my	 grand 	 father 	 	.
i	never	 k 	 new 	 	him	in	real	life	.
but	our	 live 	 s 	 	are	much	more	than	our	 memor 	 ies 	 	.
my	 grand 	 mother 	 	never	let	me	forget	his	life	.
my	duty	was	not	to	allow	it	to	have	 be 	 en 	 	in	 va 	 in 	 	,	and	my	 less 	 on 	 	was	to	learn	that	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	 histo 	 ry 	 	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	crush	us	,	but	we	 endur 	 ed 	 	.
the	next	piece	of	the	 jig 	 saw 	 	is	of	a	boat	in	the	early	dawn	 slip 	 ping 	 	 silent 	 ly 	 	out	to	sea	.
my	mother	,	mai	,	was	18	when	her	father	 di 	 ed 	 	--	 al 	 ready 	 	in	an	 arrange 	 d 	 	marriage	,	 al 	 ready 	 	with	two	small	 girl 	 s 	 	.
for	her	,	life	had	 distill 	 ed 	 	 it 	 self 	 	 in 	 to 	 	one	task	:	the	 es 	 cape 	 	of	her	family	and	a	new	life	in	australia	.
it	was	 in 	 conceiv 	 able 	 	to	her	that	she	would	not	succeed	.
so	after	a	four	-	year	 s 	 aga 	 	that	 defi 	 es 	 	fiction	,	a	boat	 s 	 lipped 	 	out	to	sea	 dis 	 guise 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 fish 	 ing 	 	vessel	.
all	the	 adult 	 s 	 	 k 	 new 	 	the	 risk 	 s 	 	.
the	 great 	 est 	 	fear	was	of	 pirate 	 s 	 	,	rape	and	death	.
like	most	 adult 	 s 	 	on	the	boat	,	my	mother	carried	a	small	bottle	of	poison	.
if	we	 we 	 re 	 	 capture 	 d 	 	,	first	my	sister	and	i	,	then	she	and	my	 grand 	 mother 	 	would	drink	.
my	first	 memor 	 ies 	 	are	from	the	boat	--	the	 stead 	 y 	 	beat	of	the	engine	,	the	bow	 dip 	 ping 	 	 in 	 to 	 	each	wave	,	the	vast	and	empty	horizon	.
i	do	n't	remember	the	 pirate 	 s 	 	who	came	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	,	but	 we 	 re 	 	_UNK_	by	the	bravado	of	the	men	on	our	boat	,	or	the	engine	 dy 	 ing 	 	and	 fail 	 ing 	 	to	start	for	six	 hour 	 s 	 	.
but	i	do	remember	the	 light 	 s 	 	on	the	oil	rig	off	the	_UNK_	coast	and	the	young	man	who	 collapse 	 d 	 	and	 di 	 ed 	 	,	the	journey	's	end	too	much	for	him	,	and	the	first	apple	i	 taste 	 d 	 	,	 give 	 n 	 	to	me	by	the	men	on	the	rig	.
no	apple	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	 taste 	 d 	 	the	same	.
after	three	 month 	 s 	 	in	a	 refuge 	 e 	 	camp	,	we	 land 	 ed 	 	in	melbourne	.
and	the	next	piece	of	the	 jig 	 saw 	 	is	about	four	women	 a 	 cross 	 	three	 generation 	 s 	 	 sha 	 ping 	 	a	new	life	together	.
we	 settl 	 ed 	 	in	footscray	,	a	 work 	 ing 	 	-	class	suburb	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 demo 	 graphic 	 	is	 layer 	 s 	 	of	 im 	 migrant 	 s 	 	.
 un 	 like 	 	the	 settl 	 ed 	 	middle	-	class	 suburb 	 s 	 	,	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 exist 	 ence 	 	i	was	 obliv 	 ious 	 	of	,	there	was	no	sense	of	entitlement	in	footscray	.
the	 smell 	 s 	 	from	shop	 door 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	from	the	rest	of	the	world	.
and	the	 snip 	 pet 	 s 	 	of	 halt 	 ing 	 	english	 we 	 re 	 	 ex 	 change 	 d 	 	between	people	who	had	one	thing	in	common	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.

 some 	 how 	 	she	found	time	to	 stud 	 y 	 	english	and	gain	it	 qual 	 ification 	 s 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	poor	.
all	the	 dollar 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 locate 	 d 	 	and	extra	 tu 	 ition 	 	in	english	and	 mathematic 	 s 	 	was	_UNK_	for	 regard 	 less 	 	of	what	 mis 	 s 	 ed 	 	out	,	which	was	 usual 	 ly 	 	new	 clothe 	 s 	 	;	they	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 second 	 hand 	 	.
two	 pair 	 s 	 	of	 stock 	 ing 	 s 	 	for	school	,	each	to	hide	the	 hole 	 s 	 	in	the	other	.
a	school	uniform	down	to	the	 ankle 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	had	to	last	for	six	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	there	 we 	 re 	 	rare	but	 s 	 ear 	 ing 	 	_UNK_	of	``	 s 	 lit 	 	-	eye	``	and	the	 occasion 	 al 	 	graffiti	:	``	asian	,	go	home	.	``	go	home	to	where	?
 some 	 thing 	 	_UNK_	 in 	 side 	 	me	.
there	was	a	 gather 	 ing 	 	of	 re 	 solve 	 	and	a	quiet	voice	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	i	will	bypass	you	.	``	my	mother	,	my	sister	and	i	slept	in	the	same	bed	.
my	mother	was	 exhaust 	 ed 	 	each	night	,	but	we	told	one	 an 	 other 	 	about	our	day	and	 listen 	 ed 	 	to	the	 move 	 ments 	 	of	my	 grand 	 mother 	 	around	the	house	.
my	mother	 suffer 	 ed 	 	from	 nightmare 	 s 	 	all	about	the	boat	.
and	my	job	was	to	stay	awake	 un 	 til 	 	her	 nightmare 	 s 	 	came	so	i	could	wake	her	.
she	 open 	 ed 	 	a	computer	store	then	 stud 	 ied 	 	to	be	a	_UNK_	and	 open 	 ed 	 	 an 	 other 	 	business	.
and	the	women	came	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	about	men	who	could	not	make	the	 transit 	 ion 	 	,	 ang 	 ry 	 	and	 in 	 flex 	 ible 	 	,	and	 trouble 	 d 	 	children	caught	between	two	 world 	 s 	 	.
 grant 	 s 	 	and	 sponsor 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 ought 	 	.
 center 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 establish 	 ed 	 	.
i	lived	in	parallel	 world 	 s 	 	.
in	one	,	i	was	the	classic	asian	student	,	 relent 	 less 	 	in	the	 demand 	 s 	 	that	i	made	on	 my 	 self 	 	.
in	the	other	,	i	was	_UNK_	in	 live 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 pre 	 car 	 ious 	 	,	 tragic 	 ally 	 	 scar 	 red 	 	by	violence	,	drug	abuse	and	 isol 	 ation 	 	.
but	so	 man 	 y 	 	over	the	 year 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 help 	 ed 	 	.
and	for	that	work	,	when	i	was	a	final	year	law	student	,	i	was	 chose 	 n 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	young	australian	of	the	year	.
and	i	was	 catapult 	 ed 	 	from	one	piece	of	the	 jig 	 saw 	 	to	 an 	 other 	 	,	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 edge 	 s 	 	did	n't	fit	.
tan	le	,	 anonym 	 ous 	 	footscray	resident	,	was	now	tan	le	,	 refuge 	 e 	 	and	social	activist	,	 invit 	 ed 	 	to	speak	in	 venue 	 s 	 	she	had	never	heard	of	and	 in 	 to 	 	 home 	 s 	 	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 exist 	 ence 	 	she	could	never	have	 imagin 	 ed 	 	.
i	did	n't	know	the	 proto 	 col 	 s 	 	.
i	did	n't	know	how	to	use	the	cutlery	.
i	did	n't	know	how	to	talk	about	wine	.
i	did	n't	know	how	to	talk	about	 any 	 thing 	 	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 re 	 treat 	 	to	the	 routine 	 s 	 	and	comfort	of	life	in	an	 un 	 s 	 ung 	 	suburb	--	a	 grand 	 mother 	 	,	a	mother	and	two	 daughter 	 s 	 	 end 	 ing 	 	each	day	 a 	 s 	 	they	had	for	 al 	 most 	 	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	 tell 	 ing 	 	one	 an 	 other 	 	the	story	of	 the 	 ir 	 	day	and	 fall 	 ing 	 	 a 	 sleep 	 	,	the	three	of	us	still	in	the	same	bed	.
i	told	my	mother	i	could	n't	do	it	.
she	 re 	 minded 	 	me	that	i	was	now	the	same	age	she	had	 be 	 en 	 	when	we	 board 	 ed 	 	the	boat	.
no	had	never	 be 	 en 	 	an	option	.
``	just	do	it	,	``	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	and	do	n't	be	what	you	're	not	.	``	so	i	spoke	out	on	youth	 un 	 employ 	 ment 	 	and	education	and	the	neglect	of	the	 marginal 	 ized 	 	and	the	 dis 	 enfranchis 	 ed 	 	.
and	the	more	 candid 	 ly 	 	i	spoke	,	the	more	i	was	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	speak	.
i	met	people	from	all	 walk 	 s 	 	of	life	,	so	 man 	 y 	 	of	them	 do 	 ing 	 	the	thing	they	 love 	 d 	 	,	living	on	the	 front 	 ier 	 s 	 	of	 possibil 	 ity 	 	.
and	even	 th 	 ough 	 	i	 finish 	 ed 	 	my	degree	,	i	 real 	 ized 	 	i	could	not	settle	 in 	 to 	 	a	 care 	 er 	 	in	law	.
there	had	to	be	 an 	 other 	 	piece	of	the	 jig 	 saw 	 	.
and	i	 real 	 ized 	 	at	the	same	time	that	it	is	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	to	be	an	 out 	 sider 	 	,	a	 re 	 cent 	 	 arriv 	 al 	 	,	new	on	the	scene	--	and	not	just	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	but	 some 	 thing 	 	to	be	 thank 	 ful 	 	for	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	a	gift	from	the	boat	.

i	have	 steppe 	 d 	 	 out 	 side 	 	my	comfort	zone	 en 	 ough 	 	now	to	know	that	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	the	world	 do 	 es 	 	fall	 a 	 part 	 	,	but	not	in	the	way	that	you	fear	.	 possibil 	 ities 	 	that	would	not	have	 be 	 en 	 	 allow 	 ed 	 	 we 	 re 	 	outrageously	 encourag 	 ed 	 	.
there	was	an	energy	there	,	an	_UNK_	 optim 	 ism 	 	,	a	strange	 mix 	 ture 	 	of	 humil 	 ity 	 	and	 da 	 ring 	 	.
so	i	 follow 	 ed 	 	my	 hunch 	 es 	 	.
i	 gather 	 ed 	 	around	me	a	small	team	of	people	for	whom	the	label	``	it	ca	n't	be	 d 	 one 	 	``	was	an	 ir 	 resist 	 ible 	 	 challeng 	 e 	 	.
for	a	year	we	 we 	 re 	 	 penni 	 less 	 	.
at	the	end	of	each	day	,	i	made	a	huge	pot	of	soup	which	we	all	 share 	 d 	 	.
we	 work 	 ed 	 	well	 in 	 to 	 	each	night	.
most	of	our	 idea 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	crazy	,	but	a	few	 we 	 re 	 	 brilli 	 ant 	 	,	and	we	broke	through	.
i	made	the	decision	to	move	to	the	u.s.	after	 on 	 ly 	 	one	trip	.
my	 hunch 	 es 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
three	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	i	had	 re 	 locate 	 d 	 	,	and	the	adventure	 ha 	 s 	 	 continu 	 ed 	 	.
before	i	close	 th 	 ough 	 	,	let	me	tell	you	about	my	 grand 	 mother 	 	.
she	grew	up	at	a	time	when	_UNK_	was	the	social	norm	and	the	local	mandarin	was	the	person	who	 matter 	 ed 	 	.
life	had	n't	 change 	 d 	 	for	centuries	.
her	father	 di 	 ed 	 	soon	after	she	was	born	.
her	mother	raised	her	 al 	 one 	 	.
at	17	she	 be 	 came 	 	the	second	wife	of	a	mandarin	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	mother	beat	her	.
with	no	support	from	her	husband	,	she	 caus 	 ed 	 	a	 sens 	 ation 	 	by	taking	him	to	court	and	 prosecut 	 ing 	 	her	own	case	,	and	a	far	 great 	 er 	 	 sens 	 ation 	 	when	she	won	.
``	it	ca	n't	be	 d 	 one 	 	``	was	 show 	 n 	 	to	be	wrong	.
i	was	taking	a	shower	in	a	hotel	room	in	sydney	the	moment	she	 di 	 ed 	 	600	 mile 	 s 	 	away	in	melbourne	.
i	 look 	 ed 	 	through	the	shower	screen	and	saw	her	 stand 	 ing 	 	on	the	other	side	.
i	 k 	 new 	 	she	had	come	to	say	 good 	 bye 	 	.
my	mother	 phone 	 d 	 	 minute 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
a	few	 day 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	we	went	to	a	buddhist	temple	in	footscray	and	 s 	 at 	 	around	her	casket	.
we	told	her	 st 	 ories 	 	and	 assur 	 ed 	 	her	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	still	with	her	.
at	 mid 	 night 	 	the	monk	came	and	told	us	he	had	to	close	the	casket	.
my	mother	 ask 	 ed 	 	us	to	feel	her	hand	.
she	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	monk	,	``	why	is	it	that	her	hand	is	so	warm	and	the	rest	of	her	is	so	cold	?	``	``	 be 	 cause 	 	you	have	 be 	 en 	 	 hold 	 ing 	 	it	since	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	``	he	 s 	 aid 	 	.
``	you	have	not	let	it	go	.	``	if	there	is	a	sinew	in	our	family	,	it	 run 	 s 	 	through	the	women	.
 give 	 n 	 	who	we	 we 	 re 	 	and	how	life	had	shaped	us	,	we	can	now	see	that	the	men	who	might	have	come	 in 	 to 	 	our	 live 	 s 	 	would	have	_UNK_	us	.
defeat	would	have	come	too	 eas 	 ily 	 	.
now	i	would	like	to	have	my	own	children	,	and	i	wonder	about	the	boat	.
who	could	ever	wish	it	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	?
yet	i	am	 af 	 raid 	 	of	privilege	,	of	ease	,	of	entitlement	.
can	i	give	them	a	bow	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	,	 dip 	 ping 	 	 brave 	 ly 	 	 in 	 to 	 	each	wave	,	the	_UNK_	and	 stead 	 y 	 	beat	of	the	engine	,	the	vast	horizon	that	 guarantee 	 s 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	?
i	do	n't	know	.
but	if	i	could	give	it	and	still	see	them	 safe 	 ly 	 	through	,	i	would	.
trevor	_UNK_	:	and	 al 	 so 	 	,	tan	's	mother	is	here	 to 	 day 	 	in	the	fourth	or	fifth	row	.
