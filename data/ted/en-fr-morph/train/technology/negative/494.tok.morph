i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 issue 	 s 	 	of	poverty	for	more	than	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	so	it	's	 iron 	 ic 	 	that	the	problem	that	and	question	that	i	most	 grappl 	 e 	 	with	is	how	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	define	poverty	.	what	 do 	 es 	 	it	mean	?
so	often	,	we	look	at	dollar	 term 	 s 	 	--	people	making	less	than	a	dollar	or	two	or	three	a	day	.
and	yet	the	 complex 	 ity 	 	of	poverty	 re 	 ally 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	look	at	income	 a 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	one	 vari 	 able 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	,	it	's	a	condition	about	choice	,
and	the	lack	of	 free 	 dom 	 	.
and	i	had	an	experience	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 deepen 	 ed 	 	and	 elucid 	 ated 	 	for	me	the	 understand 	 ing 	 	that	i	have	.
it	was	in	kenya	,	and	i	want	to	share	it	with	you	.
i	was	with	my	friend	susan	meiselas	,	the	 photograph 	 er 	 	,	in	the	mathare	 val 	 ley 	 	 s 	 lum 	 s 	 	.
now	,	mathare	 val 	 ley 	 	is	one	of	the	 old 	 est 	 	 s 	 lum 	 s 	 	in	africa	.
it	's	about	three	 mile 	 s 	 	out	of	nairobi	,	and	it	's	a	mile	long	and	about	two	-	 tenth 	 s 	 	of	a	mile	wide	,	where	over	half	a	million	people	live	 cram 	 med 	 	in	these	little	tin	 s 	 hack 	 s 	 	,	generation	after	generation	,	 rent 	 ing 	 	them	,	often	eight	or	10	people	to	a	room	.
and	it	's	known	for	 pro 	 stit 	 ution 	 	,	violence	,	 drug 	 s 	 	:
a	hard	place	to	grow	up	.
and	when	we	 we 	 re 	 	 walk 	 ing 	 	through	the	narrow	 al 	 ley 	 s 	 	,	it	was	 liter 	 ally 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	not	to	step	in	the	raw	 sew 	 age 	 	and	the	garbage	 a 	 long 	 side 	 	the	little	 home 	 s 	 	.
but	at	the	same	time	it	was	 al 	 so 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	not	to	see	the	human	 vital 	 ity 	 	,	the	 aspir 	 ation 	 	and	the	 ambit 	 ion 	 	of	the	people	who	live	there	:
women	 wash 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 bab 	 ies 	 	,	 wash 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 clothe 	 s 	 	,	 hang 	 ing 	 	them	out	to	dry	.
i	met	 th 	 is 	 	woman	,	mama	rose	,	who	 ha 	 s 	 	 rent 	 ed 	 	that	little	tin	 s 	 hack 	 	for	32	 year 	 s 	 	,	where	she	 live 	 s 	 	with	her	seven	children	.
four	sleep	in	one	 t 	 win 	 	bed	,	and	three	sleep	on	the	mud	and	 lin 	 oleum 	 	floor	.
and	she	 keep 	 s 	 	them	all	in	school	by	selling	water	from	that	kiosk	,	and	from	selling	soap	and	bread	from	the	little	store	 in 	 side 	 	.
it	was	 al 	 so 	 	the	day	after	the	 inaugu 	 ration 	 	,	and	i	was	 re 	 minded 	 	how	mathare	is	still	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	the	 glob 	 e 	 	.
and	i	would	see	 kid 	 s 	 	on	the	street	 corner 	 s 	 	,
and	they	'd	say	``	obama	,	he	's	our	brother	!	``
and	i	'd	say	``	well	,	obama	's	my	brother	,	so	that	 make 	 s 	 	you	my	brother	too	.	``
and	they	would	look	 quiz 	 z 	 ically 	 	,	and	then	be	like	,	``	high	five	!	``
and	it	was	here	that	i	met	jane	.
i	was	 s 	 truck 	 	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	by	the	 kind 	 ness 	 	and	the	 gentle 	 ness 	 	in	her	face	,	and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	her	to	tell	me	her	story	.
she	 start 	 ed 	 	off	by	 tell 	 ing 	 	me	her	dream	.	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	had	two	.
my	first	dream	was	to	be	a	doctor	,	and	the	second	was	to	marry	a	good	man	who	would	stay	with	me	and	my	family	,
 be 	 cause 	 	my	mother	was	a	single	mom	,	and	could	n't	afford	to	pay	for	school	 fee 	 s 	 	.
so	i	had	to	give	up	the	first	dream	,	and	i	focused	on	the	second	.	``
she	got	married	when	she	was	18	,	had	a	baby	right	away	.
and	when	she	 turn 	 ed 	 	20	,	found	 her 	 self 	 	 pregn 	 ant 	 	with	a	second	child	,	her	mom	 di 	 ed 	 	and	her	husband	left	her	--	married	 an 	 other 	 	woman	.
so	she	was	 aga 	 in 	 	in	mathare	,	with	no	income	,	no	skill	set	,	no	money	.
and	so	she	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	to	 pro 	 stit 	 ution 	 	.
it	was	n't	 organize 	 d 	 	in	the	way	we	often	think	of	it	.
she	would	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	city	at	night	with	about	20	 girl 	 s 	 	,	look	for	work	,	and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	come	back	with	a	few	 s 	 hill 	 ing 	 s 	 	,
or	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	with	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	,	the	poverty	was	n't	so	bad	.	it	was	the	 humil 	 iation 	 
and	the	 embarrass 	 ment 	 	of	it	all	.	``
in	2001	,	her	life	 change 	 d 	 	.
she	had	a	girlfriend	who	had	heard	about	 th 	 is 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	,	jamii	bora	,	that	would	lend	money	to	people	no	matter	how	poor	you	 we 	 re 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	you	 provide 	 d 	 	a	 commen 	 sur 	 ate 	 	amount	in	 saving 	 s 	 	.
and	so	she	 s 	 pent 	 	a	year	to	 s 	 ave 	 	50	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	and	 start 	 ed 	 	 borrow 	 ing 	 	,	and	over	time	she	was	able	to	buy	a	 sew 	 ing 	 	machine	.
she	 start 	 ed 	 	 tailor 	 ing 	 	.
and	that	 turn 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	what	she	 do 	 es 	 	now	,	which	is	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	 second 	 hand 	 	 cloth 	 ing 	 	 market 	 s 	 	,	and	for	about	three	 dollar 	 s 	 	and	25	 cent 	 s 	 	she	 buy 	 s 	 	an	old	ball	gown	.
some	of	them	might	be	 one 	 s 	 	you	 g 	 ave 	 	.
and	she	 re 	 purpose 	 s 	 	them	with	 frill 	 s 	 	and	 ribbon 	 s 	 	,	and	 make 	 s 	 	these	 fro 	 thy 	 	 confection 	 s 	 	that	she	 sell 	 s 	 	to	women	for	 the 	 ir 	 	daughter	's	sweet	16	or	first	holy	 commun 	 ion 	 	--	 t 	 hose 	 	 mile 	 stone 	 s 	 	in	a	life	that	people	want	to	 celebr 	 ate 	 
all	 a 	 long 	 	the	economic	spectrum	.
and	she	 do 	 es 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	good	business	.	in	fact	,	i	 watch 	 ed 	 	her	walk	through	the	 street 	 s 	 	 hawk 	 ing 	 	.	and	before	you	 k 	 new 	 	it	,	there	was	a	crowd	of	women	around	her	,	 buy 	 ing 	 	these	 dress 	 es 	 	.
and	i	 reflect 	 ed 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	was	 watch 	 ing 	 	her	sell	the	 dress 	 es 	 	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	the	 jewel 	 ry 	 	that	she	 make 	 s 	 	,	that	now	jane	 make 	 s 	 	more	than	four	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	day	.
and	by	 man 	 y 	 	 definition 	 s 	 	she	is	no	 long 	 er 	 	poor	.
but	she	still	 live 	 s 	 	in	mathare	 val 	 ley 	 	.
and	so	she	ca	n't	move	out	.
she	 live 	 s 	 	with	all	of	that	 in 	 security 	 	,	and	in	fact	,	in	january	,	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	ethnic	 riot 	 s 	 	,	she	was	 chase 	 d 	 	from	her	home	and	had	to	find	a	new	 s 	 hack 	 
in	which	she	would	live	.
jamii	bora	 understand 	 s 	 	that	and	 understand 	 s 	 	that	when	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	poverty	,	we	've	got	to	look	at	people	all	 a 	 long 	 	the	economic	spectrum	.
and	so	with	patient	capital	from	acumen	and	other	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	,	 loan 	 s 	 	and	 invest 	 ments 	 	that	will	go	the	long	term	with	them	,	they	built	a	low	-	cost	housing	 develop 	 ment 	 	,	about	an	hour	 out 	 side 	 	nairobi	central	.
and	they	designed	it	from	the	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	of	 custom 	 ers 	 	like	jane	 her 	 self 	 	,	 insist 	 ing 	 	on	 respons 	 ibility 	 	and	 account 	 ability 	 	.
so	she	 ha 	 s 	 	to	give	10	percent	of	the	mortgage	--	of	the	total	value	,	or	about	400	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	 saving 	 s 	 	.
and	then	they	match	her	mortgage	to	what	she	paid	in	rent	for	her	little	shanty	.
and	in	the	next	couple	of	 week 	 s 	 	,	she	's	going	to	be	among	the	first	200	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	to	move	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
when	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	her	if	she	 fear 	 ed 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	,	or	 whet 	 her 	 	she	would	 mis 	 s 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	from	mathare	,	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	would	i	fear
that	i	have	n't	 confront 	 ed 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	?
i	'm	hiv	positive	.	i	've	 deal 	 t 	 	with	it	all	.	``
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	would	i	 mis 	 s 	 	?
you	think	i	will	 mis 	 s 	 	the	violence	or	the	 drug 	 s 	 	?	the	lack	of	 pri 	 vac 	 y 	 	?
do	you	think	i	'll	 mis 	 s 	 	not	 know 	 ing 	 	if	my	children	are	going	to	come	home	at	the	end	of	the	day	?	``	she	 s 	 aid 	 	``	if	you	 g 	 ave 	 	me	10	 minute 	 s 	 
my	 bag 	 s 	 	would	be	 pack 	 ed 	 	.	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	what	about	your	 dream 	 s 	 	?	``
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	you	know	,	my	 dream 	 s 	 	do	n't	look	 exact 	 ly 	 	like	i	thought	they	would	when	i	was	a	little	girl	.
but	if	i	think	about	it	,	i	thought	i	 want 	 ed 	 	a	husband	,	but	what	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	was	a	family
that	was	loving	.	and	i	 fierce 	 ly 	 	love	my	children	,	and	they	love	me	back	.	``
she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	thought	that	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	a	doctor	,	but	what	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	was	 some 	 body
