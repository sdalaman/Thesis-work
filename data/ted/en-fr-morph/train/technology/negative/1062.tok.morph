my	story	 actual 	 ly 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	when	i	was	four	 year 	 s 	 	old	and	my	family	 move 	 d 	 	to	a	new	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	in	our	 home 	 town 	 	of	 savanna 	 h 	 	,	georgia	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	1960s	when	 actual 	 ly 	 	all	the	 street 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	 we 	 re 	 	named	after	confederate	war	 general 	 s 	 	.
we	lived	on	robert	e.	lee	boulevard	.
and	when	i	was	five	,	my	 parent 	 s 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	me	an	 o 	 range 	 	schwinn	 s 	 ting 	 	-	ray	 bi 	 cycle 	 	.	it	had	a	 swoop 	 ing 	 	banana	seat	and	 t 	 hose 	 	ape	 hang 	 er 	 	 handle 	 bar 	 s 	 	that	made	the	rider	look	like	an	orangutan	.
that	's	why	they	 we 	 re 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	ape	 hang 	 ers 	 	.	they	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 model 	 ed 	 	on	 hot 	 rod 	 	 motor 	 cycle 	 s 	 	of	the	1960s	,	which	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	my	mom	did	n't	know	.
and	one	day	i	was	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	cul	-	de	-	sac	 hid 	 den 	 	away	a	few	 street 	 s 	 	away	.
and	i	came	back	,	and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	turn	around	and	get	back	to	that	street	more	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	turn	around	in	 th 	 is 	 	big	street	that	 intersect 	 ed 	 	our	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	,	and	wham	!	i	was	hit	by	a	 pass 	 ing 	 	 s 	 ed 	 an 	 	.
my	 man 	 gle 	 d 	 	body	flew	in	one	direction	,	my	 man 	 gle 	 d 	 	bike	flew	in	the	other	.
and	i	lay	on	the	 pave 	 ment 	 	 stretch 	 ing 	 	over	that	yellow	line	,	and	one	of	my	 neighbor 	 s 	 	came	running	over	.
``	andy	,	andy	,	how	are	you	 do 	 ing 	 	?	``	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	using	the	name	of	my	 old 	 er 	 	brother	.
``	i	'm	bruce	,	``	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	and	 prompt 	 ly 	 	 pass 	 ed 	 	out	.
i	broke	my	left	femur	that	day	--	it	's	the	largest	bone	in	your	body	--	and	 s 	 pent 	 	the	next	two	 month 	 s 	 	in	a	body	cast	that	went	from	my	chin	to	the	tip	of	my	 to 	 e 	 	to	my	right	knee	,	and	a	steel	bar	went	from	my	right	knee	to	my	left	ankle	.
and	for	the	next	38	 year 	 s 	 	,	that	accident	was	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 medical 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	that	ever	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	me	.
in	fact	,	i	made	a	living	by	 walk 	 ing 	 	.
i	 travel 	 ed 	 	around	the	world	,	 enter 	 ed 	 	different	 culture 	 s 	 	,	wrote	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 book 	 s 	 	about	my	 travel 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	``	 walk 	 ing 	 	the	 b 	 ible 	 	.	``
i	 host 	 ed 	 	a	 tele 	 vision 	 	show	by	that	name	on	pbs	.
i	was	,	for	all	the	world	,	the	``	 walk 	 ing 	 	guy	.	``
 un 	 til 	 	,	in	may	2008	,	a	routine	visit	to	my	doctor	and	a	routine	blood	test	 produce 	 d 	 	evidence	in	the	form	of	an	 al 	 ka 	 line 	 	 phosp 	 hat 	 ase 	 	number	that	 some 	 thing 	 	might	be	wrong	with	my	 bone 	 s 	 	.
and	my	doctor	,	on	a	whim	,	 s 	 ent 	 	me	to	get	a	full	-	body	bone	 s 	 can 	 	,	which	 show 	 ed 	 	that	there	was	some	growth	in	my	left	leg	.
that	 s 	 ent 	 	me	to	an	x	-	ray	,	then	to	an	mri	.
and	one	afternoon	,	i	got	a	call	from	my	doctor	.
``	the	tumor	in	your	leg	is	not	 consist 	 ent 	 	with	a	benign	tumor	.	``
i	 stop 	 ped 	 	 walk 	 ing 	 	,
and	it	took	my	mind	a	second	to	convert	that	double	negative	 in 	 to 	 	a	much	more	 horr 	 ifying 	 	negative	.
i	have	cancer	.
and	to	think	that	the	tumor	was	in	the	same	bone	,	in	the	same	place	in	my	body	 a 	 s 	 	the	accident	38	 year 	 s 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	--
it	 seem 	 ed 	 	like	too	much	of	a	 co 	 incidence 	 	.
so	that	afternoon	,	i	went	back	to	my	house	,	and	my	three	year	-	old	 ident 	 ical 	 	 t 	 win 	 	 daughter 	 s 	 	,	eden	and	tybee	feiler	,	came	running	to	meet	me	.
they	'd	just	 turn 	 ed 	 	three	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 in 	 to 	 	all	 thing 	 s 	 	pink	and	 pur 	 ple 	 	.
in	fact	,	we	 call 	 ed 	 	them	pinkalicious	and	purplicious	--	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	i	must	say	,	our	 favor 	 ite 	 	 nick 	 name 	 	 occur 	 red 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 birth 	 day 	 	,	april	15th	.
when	they	 we 	 re 	 	born	at	6:14	and	6:46	on	april	15	,	2005	,	our	 other 	 wise 	 	grim	,	 humor 	 less 	 	doctor	 look 	 ed 	 	at	his	watch	,	and	was	like	,	``	hmm	,	april	15th	--	tax	day	.
early	filer	and	late	filer	.	``
the	next	day	i	came	to	see	him	.	i	was	like	,	``	doctor	,	that	was	a	 re 	 ally 	 	good	joke	.	``
and	he	was	like	,	``	you	're	the	writer	,	kid	.	``
 any 	 way 	 	--	so	they	had	just	 turn 	 ed 	 	three	,	and	they	came	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	dance	they	had	just	made	up	where	they	 we 	 re 	 	 twirl 	 ing 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	and	 fast 	 er 	 	 un 	 til 	 	they	 tumble 	 d 	 	to	the	ground	,	 laugh 	 ing 	 	with	all	the	glee	in	the	world	.
i	 crumb 	 led 	 	.
i	 ke 	 pt 	 	 imagin 	 ing 	 	all	the	 walk 	 s 	 	i	might	not	take	with	them	,	the	art	 project 	 s 	 	i	might	not	mess	up	,	the	 boyfriend 	 s 	 	i	might	not	 s 	 cow 	 l 	 	at	,	the	 aisle 	 s 	 	i	might	not	walk	down	.
would	they	wonder	who	i	was	,	i	thought	.
would	they	 year 	 n 	 	for	my	approval	,	my	love	,	my	voice	?
a	few	 day 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	i	 wok 	 e 	 	with	an	idea	of	how	i	might	give	them	that	voice	.
i	would	reach	out	to	six	men	from	all	 part 	 s 	 	of	my	life	and	ask	them	to	be	present	in	the	 pass 	 age 	 s 	 	of	my	 daughter 	 s 	 	'	 live 	 s 	 	.
``	i	 believ 	 e 	 	my	 girl 	 s 	 	will	have	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	,	``	i	wrote	these	men	.
``	they	'll	have	loving	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	and	 wel 	 coming 	 	 home 	 s 	 	,	but	they	may	not	have	me	.
they	may	not	have	 the 	 ir 	 	dad	.
will	you	help	be	 the 	 ir 	 	dad	?	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	to	 my 	 self 	 	i	would	call	 th 	 is 	 	group	of	men	``	the	council	of	 dad 	 s 	 	.	``
now	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	i	had	 th 	 is 	 	idea	,	i	 decide 	 d 	 	i	would	n't	tell	my	wife	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
she	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 up 	 beat 	 	,	 natural 	 ly 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	person	.
there	's	 th 	 is 	 	idea	in	 th 	 is 	 	culture	--	i	do	n't	have	to	tell	you	--	that	you	sort	of	``	happy	``	your	way	through	a	problem	.
we	should	focus	on	the	positive	.
my	wife	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	she	grew	up	 out 	 side 	 	of	boston	.
she	's	got	a	big	 s 	 mile 	 	.	she	's	got	a	big	 personal 	 ity 	 	.
she	's	got	big	hair	--
 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	,	she	told	me	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	i	ca	n't	say	she	 ha 	 s 	 	big	hair	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	i	say	she	 ha 	 s 	 	big	hair	,	people	will	think	she	's	from	texas	.
and	it	's	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	to	marry	a	boy	from	georgia	,	but	not	to	have	hair	from	texas	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	in	her	defense	,	if	she	 we 	 re 	 	here	right	now	,	she	would	point	out	that	,	when	we	got	married	in	georgia	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	three	 question 	 s 	 	on	the	marriage	certificate	 licens 	 e 	 	,	the	third	of	which	was	,	``	are	you	related	?	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	look	,	in	georgia	at	 l 	 east 	 	we	want	to	know	.
in	arkansas	they	do	n't	even	ask	.	``
what	i	did	n't	tell	her	is	,	if	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	``	you	could	jump	.
you	do	n't	need	the	30	-	day	 wait 	 ing 	 	period	.	 be 	 cause 	 	you	do	n't	need	the	get	-	to	-	know	-	you	session	at	that	point	.
so	i	was	n't	going	to	tell	her	about	 th 	 is 	 	idea	,	but	the	next	day	i	could	n't	control	 my 	 self 	 	,	i	told	her	.
and	she	 love 	 d 	 	the	idea	,	but	she	 quick 	 ly 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	 reject 	 ing 	 	my	 nominee 	 s 	 	.
she	was	like	,	``	well	,	i	love	him	,	but	i	would	never	ask	him	for	 ad 	 vice 	 	.	``
so	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	that	 start 	 ing 	 	a	council	of	 dad 	 s 	 	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	efficient	way	to	find	out	what	my	wife	 re 	 ally 	 	thought	of	my	 friend 	 s 	 	.
so	we	 decide 	 d 	 	that	we	 need 	 ed 	 	a	set	of	 rule 	 s 	 	,	and	we	came	up	with	a	number	.
and	the	first	one	was	no	family	,	 on 	 ly 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	.
we	thought	our	family	would	 al 	 ready 	 	be	there	.
second	,	men	 on 	 ly 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	fill	the	dad	-	space	in	the	 girl 	 s 	 	'	 live 	 s 	 	.
and	then	third	,	sort	of	a	dad	for	every	side	.
we	kind	of	went	through	my	 personal 	 ity 	 	and	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	get	a	dad	who	 represent 	 ed 	 	each	different	thing	.
so	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	was	i	wrote	a	letter	to	each	of	these	men	.
and	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 s 	 end 	 	it	,	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	read	it	to	them	in	person	.
linda	,	my	wife	,	 jok 	 ed 	 	that	it	was	like	 hav 	 ing 	 	six	different	marriage	 proposal 	 s 	 	.
i	sort	of	friend	-	married	each	of	these	 guy 	 s 	 	.
and	the	first	of	these	 guy 	 s 	 	was	jeff	schumlin	.
now	jeff	led	 th 	 is 	 	trip	i	took	to	europe	when	i	 graduate 	 d 	 	from	high	school	in	the	early	1980s	.
and	on	that	first	day	we	 we 	 re 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	youth	 host 	 el 	 	in	a	castle	.
and	i	snuck	out	 be 	 hind 	 	,
and	there	was	a	 mo 	 at 	 	,	a	 f 	 ence 	 	and	a	field	of	 cow 	 s 	 	.
and	jeff	came	up	 be 	 side 	 	me	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	so	,	have	you	ever	 be 	 en 	 	cow	 tip 	 ping 	 	?	``
i	was	like	,	``	cow	 tip 	 ping 	 	?
he	was	like	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	.	 cow 	 s 	 	sleep	 stand 	 ing 	 	up	.
so	if	you	approach	them	from	 be 	 hind 	 	,	down	wind	,	you	can	push	them	over	and	they	go	 th 	 ud 	 	in	the	mud	.	``
so	before	i	had	a	chance	to	determine	 whet 	 her 	 	 th 	 is 	 	was	right	or	not	,	we	had	 jump 	 ed 	 	the	 mo 	 at 	 	,	we	had	 climb 	 ed 	 	the	 f 	 ence 	 	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 tiptoe 	 ing 	 	through	the	dung	and	 approach 	 ing 	 	some	poor	,	 doz 	 ing 	 	cow	.
so	a	few	 week 	 s 	 	after	my	 diagnos 	 is 	 	,	we	went	up	to	vermont	,	and	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	put	jeff	 a 	 s 	 	the	first	person	in	the	council	of	 dad 	 s 	 	.
and	we	went	to	 th 	 is 	 	apple	 orc 	 hard 	 	,	and	i	read	him	 th 	 is 	 	letter	.
``	will	you	help	be	 the 	 ir 	 	dad	?	``
and	i	got	to	the	end	--	he	was	 cry 	 ing 	 	and	i	was	 cry 	 ing 	 	--	and	then	he	 look 	 ed 	 	at	me	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	.	``
i	was	like	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	?	``
i	kind	of	had	 for 	 gotten 	 	there	was	a	question	at	the	heart	of	my	letter	.
and	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	i	keep	 get 	 ting 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	it	never	 occur 	 red 	 	to	me	that	 any 	 body 	 	would	turn	me	down	under	the	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	.
and	then	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	him	a	question	,	which	i	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 ask 	 ing 	 	to	all	the	 dad 	 s 	 	and	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 re 	 ally 	 	 encourag 	 ing 	 	me	to	write	 th 	 is 	 	story	down	in	a	book	.
and	that	was	,	``	what	's	the	one	piece	of	 ad 	 vice 	 	you	would	give	to	my	 girl 	 s 	 	?	``
and	jeff	's	 ad 	 vice 	 	was	,	``	be	a	 travel 	 ler 	 	,	not	a	tourist	.
get	off	the	bus	.	seek	out	what	's	different	.
approach	the	cow	.	``
``	so	it	's	10	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	,	``	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	and	my	 daughter 	 s 	 	are	about	to	take	 the 	 ir 	 	first	trip	 a 	 broad 	 	,	and	i	'm	not	here	.
what	would	you	tell	them	?	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	would	approach	 th 	 is 	 	journey	 a 	 s 	 	a	young	child	might	approach	a	mud	 pudd 	 le 	 	.

and	 a 	 s 	 	he	 talk 	 ed 	 	he	had	that	glint	in	his	eye	that	i	first	saw	back	in	holland	--	the	glint	that	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	let	's	go	cow	 tip 	 ping 	 	,	``	even	 th 	 ough 	 	we	never	did	tip	the	cow	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	no	one	 tip 	 s 	 	the	cow	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	 cow 	 s 	 	do	n't	sleep	 stand 	 ing 	 	up	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	want	to	see	you	back	here	 girl 	 s 	 	,	at	the	end	of	 th 	 is 	 	experience	,	 cover 	 ed 	 	in	mud	.	``
two	 week 	 s 	 	after	my	 diagnos 	 is 	 	,	a	biopsy	 confirm 	 ed 	 	i	had	a	seven	-	inch	 osteo 	 sarcoma 	 	in	my	left	femur	.
six	hundred	americans	a	year	get	an	 osteo 	 sarcoma 	 	.
 eight 	 y 	 	-	five	percent	are	under	21	.
 on 	 ly 	 	a	hundred	 adult 	 s 	 	a	year	get	one	of	these	 disease 	 s 	 	.
twenty	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 doctor 	 s 	 	would	have	cut	off	my	leg	and	 hop 	 ed 	 	,	and	there	was	a	15	percent	 surviv 	 al 	 	rate	.
and	then	in	the	1980	's	,	they	 determine 	 d 	 	that	one	 part 	 icular 	 	 cock 	 tail 	 	of	chemo	could	be	effective	,
and	 with 	 in 	 	 week 	 s 	 	i	had	 start 	 ed 	 	that	regimen	.
and	since	we	are	in	a	medical	room	,	i	went	through	four	and	a	half	 month 	 s 	 	of	chemo	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	i	had	cisplatin	,	doxorubicin	and	 ver 	 y 	 	high	-	dose	methotrexate	.
and	then	i	had	a	15	-	hour	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	in	which	my	surgeon	,	dr.	john	healey	at	memorial	sloan	-	kettering	hospital	in	new	york	,	took	out	my	left	femur	and	 replace 	 d 	 	it	with	 titan 	 ium 	 	.
and	if	you	did	see	the	sanjay	special	,	you	saw	these	enormous	 screw 	 s 	 	that	they	 screw 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	my	 pel 	 vis 	 	.
then	he	took	my	fibula	from	my	 ca 	 lf 	 	,	cut	it	out	and	then	 re 	 locate 	 d 	 	it	to	my	 t 	 high 	 	,	where	it	now	 live 	 s 	 	.
and	what	he	 actual 	 ly 	 	did	was	he	de	-	 vascular 	 ized 	 	it	from	my	 ca 	 lf 	 	and	re	-	 vascular 	 ized 	 	it	in	my	 t 	 high 	 	and	then	 connect 	 ed 	 	it	to	the	good	 part 	 s 	 	of	my	knee	and	my	hip	.
and	then	he	took	out	a	third	of	my	 quad 	 rice 	 ps 	 	muscle	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	so	rare	 on 	 ly 	 	two	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	have	 surviv 	 ed 	 	it	before	me	.
and	my	reward	for	 surviv 	 ing 	 	it	was	to	go	back	for	four	more	 month 	 s 	 	of	chemo	.
it	was	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	 s 	 aid 	 	in	my	house	,	a	lost	year	.
 be 	 cause 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 open 	 ing 	 	 week 	 s 	 	,	we	all	had	 nightmare 	 s 	 	.	and	one	night	i	had	a	nightmare	that	i	was	 walk 	 ing 	 	through	my	house	,	 s 	 at 	 	at	my	desk	and	saw	 photograph 	 s 	 	of	 some 	 one 	 	else	's	children	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	on	my	desk	.
and	i	remember	a	 part 	 icular 	 	one	night	that	,	when	you	told	that	story	of	--	i	do	n't	know	where	you	are	dr.	nuland	--	of	william	sloane	coffin	--	it	made	me	think	of	it	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	in	the	hospital	after	,	i	think	it	was	my	fourth	round	of	chemo	when	my	 number 	 s 	 	went	to	zero	,	and	i	had	 bas 	 ically 	 	no	 immun 	 e 	 	system	.
and	they	put	me	in	an	 infect 	 ious 	 	disease	ward	at	the	hospital	.
and	 any 	 body 	 	who	came	to	see	me	had	to	cover	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	a	mask	and	cover	all	of	the	 extra 	 ne 	 ous 	 	 part 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	body	.
and	one	night	i	got	a	call	from	my	mother	-	in	-	law	that	my	 daughter 	 s 	 	,	at	that	time	three	and	a	half	,	 we 	 re 	 	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	me	and	 feel 	 ing 	 	my	 ab 	 s 	 ence 	 	.
and	i	hung	up	the	phone	,	and	i	put	my	face	in	my	 hand 	 s 	 	,	and	i	 s 	 cream 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	silent	 s 	 cream 	 	.
and	what	you	 s 	 aid 	 	,	dr.	nuland	--	i	do	n't	know	where	you	are	--	made	me	think	of	 th 	 is 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	thought	that	came	to	my	mind	was	that	the	 feel 	 ing 	 	that	i	had	was	like	a	 prim 	 al 	 	 s 	 cream 	 	.
and	what	was	so	 s 	 tri 	 king 	 	--	and	one	of	the	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	i	want	to	 leav 	 e 	 	you	here	with	 to 	 day 	 	--	is	the	experience	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	 be 	 came 	 	less	and	less	human	--	and	at	 th 	 is 	 	moment	in	my	life	,	i	was	 prob 	 ably 	 	30	 pound 	 s 	 	less	than	i	am	right	now	.
of	course	,	i	had	no	hair	and	no	 immun 	 e 	 	system	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 put 	 ting 	 	blood	 in 	 side 	 	my	body	.
at	that	moment	i	was	less	and	less	human	,
i	was	 al 	 so 	 	,	at	the	same	time	,	 may 	 be 	 	the	most	human	i	've	ever	 be 	 en 	 	.
and	what	was	so	 s 	 tri 	 king 	 	about	that	time	was	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 re 	 puls 	 ing 	 	people	,	i	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 prov 	 ing 	 	to	be	a	magnet	for	people	.
people	 we 	 re 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	drawn	.
when	my	wife	and	i	had	 kid 	 s 	 	,	we	thought	it	would	be	all	-	 hand 	 s 	 	-	on	-	deck	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	it	was	 every 	 body 	 	running	the	other	way	.
and	when	i	had	cancer	,	we	thought	it	'd	be	 every 	 body 	 	running	the	other	way	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	it	was	all	-	 hand 	 s 	 	-	on	-	deck	.
and	when	people	came	to	me	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 be 	 ing 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	off	by	what	they	saw	--	i	was	like	a	living	ghost	--	they	 we 	 re 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 move 	 d 	 	to	talk	about	what	was	going	on	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 live 	 s 	 	.
cancer	,	i	found	,	is	a	 pass 	 port 	 	to	 in 	 timacy 	 	.
it	is	an	 invit 	 ation 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	even	a	 man 	 date 	 	,	to	enter	the	most	vital	 arena 	 s 	 	of	human	life	,	the	most	sensitive	and	the	most	 frighten 	 ing 	 	,	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	we	never	want	to	go	to	,	but	when	we	do	go	there	,	we	feel	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 transform 	 ed 	 	when	we	do	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	my	 girl 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	 beg 	 an 	 	to	see	,	and	,	we	thought	,	 may 	 be 	 	 be 	 came 	 	an	ounce	more	 com 	 passionate 	 	.
one	day	,	my	daughter	tybee	,	tybee	came	to	me	,	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	have	so	much	love	for	you	in	my	body	,	 d 	 addy 	 	,	i	ca	n't	stop	giving	you	 hug 	 s 	 	and	 kiss 	 es 	 	.
and	when	i	have	no	more	love	left	,	i	just	drink	milk	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	where	love	 come 	 s 	 	from	.	``
and	one	night	my	daughter	eden	came	to	me	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	 lift 	 ed 	 	my	leg	out	of	bed	,	she	 reach 	 ed 	 	for	my	 crutch 	 es 	 	and	 hand 	 ed 	 	them	to	me	.
in	fact	,	if	i	 cl 	 ing 	 	to	one	 memor 	 y 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	year	,	it	would	be	 walk 	 ing 	 	down	a	 dark 	 ened 	 	 hall 	 way 	 	with	five	spongy	 finger 	 s 	 	 grasp 	 ing 	 	the	handle	 under 	 neath 	 	my	hand	.
i	did	n't	need	the	crutch	 any 	 more 	 	,	i	was	 walk 	 ing 	 	on	air	.
and	one	of	the	 pro 	 found 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	was	 th 	 is 	 	act	of	 actual 	 ly 	 	 connect 	 ing 	 	to	all	these	people	.
and	it	made	me	think	--	and	i	'll	just	note	for	the	record	--	one	word	that	i	've	 on 	 ly 	 	heard	once	 actual 	 ly 	 	was	when	we	 we 	 re 	 	all	 do 	 ing 	 	tony	robbins	 y 	 oga 	 	 yester 	 day 	 	--	the	one	word	that	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 be 	 en 	 	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 semi 	 nar 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	is	the	word	``	friend	.	``
and	yet	from	 every 	 thing 	 	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	--	compliance	,	or	 addict 	 ion 	 	,	or	weight	loss	--	we	now	know	that	community	is	 import 	 ant 	 	,	and	yet	it	's	one	thing	we	do	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	 br 	 ing 	 	in	.
and	there	was	 some 	 thing 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 pro 	 found 	 	about	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	down	with	my	 close 	 st 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	and	 tell 	 ing 	 	them	what	they	 me 	 ant 	 	to	me	.
and	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	is	that	over	time	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	men	,	who	used	to	be	non	-	communicative	,	are	 be 	 coming 	 	more	and	more	communicative	.
and	that	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	--	there	was	one	in	my	life	--	is	 th 	 is 	 	council	of	 dad 	 s 	 	that	linda	 s 	 aid 	 	,	what	we	 we 	 re 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	,	it	's	like	what	the	 mom 	 s 	 	talk	about	at	school	drop	-	off	.
and	no	one	 capture 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	modern	 man 	 hood 	 	to	me	more	than	david	black	.
now	david	is	my	 liter 	 ary 	 	agent	.
he	's	about	five	-	foot	three	and	a	half	on	a	good	day	,	 stand 	 ing 	 	fully	 up 	 right 	 	in	 cow 	 boy 	 	 boot 	 s 	 	.
and	on	kind	of	the	 man 	 ly 	 	-	male	front	,	he	 answer 	 s 	 	the	phone	--	i	can	say	 th 	 is 	 	i	guess	 be 	 cause 	 	you	've	 d 	 one 	 	it	here	--	he	 answer 	 s 	 	the	phone	,	``	yo	,	 mother 	 fuck 	 er 	 	.	``
he	 give 	 s 	 	 bor 	 ing 	 	 speech 	 es 	 	about	 obscur 	 e 	 	 bottle 	 s 	 	of	wine	,	and	on	his	50th	 birth 	 day 	 	he	 b 	 ought 	 	a	 convert 	 ible 	 	 s 	 port 	 s 	 	car	--
 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	,	like	a	lot	of	men	,	he	's	 im 	 patient 	 	;	he	 b 	 ought 	 	it	on	his	49th	.
but	like	a	lot	of	modern	men	,	he	 hug 	 s 	 	,	he	 bake 	 s 	 	,	he	 leav 	 es 	 	work	early	to	coach	little	league	.
 some 	 one 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	if	he	 cri 	 ed 	 	when	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	him	to	be	in	the	council	of	 dad 	 s 	 	.
i	was	like	,	``	david	 cri 	 es 	 	when	you	 invit 	 e 	 	him	to	take	a	walk	.	``
but	he	's	a	 liter 	 ary 	 	agent	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	he	's	a	broker	of	 dream 	 s 	 	in	a	world	where	most	 dream 	 s 	 	do	n't	come	true	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	 want 	 ed 	 	him	to	capture	--	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	to	have	 set 	 back 	 s 	 	and	then	 aspir 	 ations 	 	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	's	the	most	 valu 	 able 	 	thing	you	can	give	to	a	 dream 	 er 	 	?	``
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	a	belief	in	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.	``
``	but	when	i	came	to	see	you	,	``	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	did	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	in	 my 	 self 	 	.
i	was	at	a	wall	.	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	do	n't	see	the	wall	,	``	and	i	'm	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	the	same	,	do	n't	see	the	wall	.
you	may	 en 	 counter 	 	one	from	time	to	time	,	but	you	've	got	to	find	a	way	to	get	over	it	,	around	it	,	or	through	it	.
but	 what 	 ever 	 	you	do	,	do	n't	succumb	to	it	.	do	n't	give	in	to	the	wall	.
my	home	is	not	far	from	the	brooklyn	bridge	,	and	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	year	and	a	half	i	was	on	 crutch 	 es 	 	,	it	 be 	 came 	 	a	sort	of	symbol	to	me	.
so	one	day	near	the	end	of	my	journey	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	come	on	 girl 	 s 	 	,	let	's	take	a	walk	 a 	 cross 	 	the	brooklyn	bridge	.	``
we	set	out	on	 crutch 	 es 	 	.
i	was	on	 crutch 	 es 	 	,	my	wife	was	next	to	me	,	my	 girl 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	these	 rock 	 star 	 	 pose 	 s 	 	up	 a 	 head 	 	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	 walk 	 ing 	 	was	one	of	the	first	 thing 	 s 	 	i	lost	,	i	 s 	 pent 	 	most	of	that	year	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	most	 element 	 al 	 	of	human	 act 	 s 	 	.
 walk 	 ing 	 	 up 	 right 	 	,	we	are	told	,	is	the	threshold	of	what	made	us	human	.
and	yet	,	for	the	four	million	 year 	 s 	 	 human 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 walk 	 ing 	 	 up 	 right 	 	,	the	act	is	 essential 	 ly 	 	 un 	 change 	 d 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	my	physical	therapist	 like 	 s 	 	to	say	,	``	every	step	is	a	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	 wait 	 ing 	 	to	happen	.	``
you	 near 	 ly 	 	fall	with	one	leg	,	then	you	catch	 your 	 self 	 	with	the	other	.
and	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 con 	 sequence 	 	of	 walk 	 ing 	 	on	 crutch 	 es 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	i	did	for	a	year	and	a	half	--	is	that	you	walk	 s 	 lower 	 	.
you	 hur 	 ry 	 	,
you	get	where	you	're	going	,	but	you	get	there	 al 	 one 	 	.
you	go	 s 	 low 	 	,	you	get	where	you	're	going	,	but	you	get	there	with	 th 	 is 	 	community	you	built	 a 	 long 	 	the	way	.
at	the	risk	of	 ad 	 mission 	 	,	i	was	never	 nic 	 er 	 	than	the	year	i	was	on	 crutch 	 es 	 	.
200	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	a	new	type	of	pedestrian	 appear 	 ed 	 	in	paris	.
he	was	 call 	 ed 	 	a	``	flaneur	,	``	one	who	 wander 	 s 	 	the	arcades	.
and	it	was	the	custom	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 flaneur 	 s 	 	to	show	they	 we 	 re 	 	men	of	leisure	by	taking	 turtle 	 s 	 	for	 walk 	 s 	 	and	 lett 	 ing 	 	the	 reptil 	 e 	 	set	the	pace	.
and	i	just	love	 th 	 is 	 	 o 	 de 	 	to	 s 	 low 	 	moving	.
and	it	's	 be 	 come 	 	my	own	 mot 	 to 	 	for	my	 girl 	 s 	 	.
take	a	walk	with	a	turtle	.
 be 	 hold 	 	the	world	in	pause	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	 pa 	 using 	 	may	be	the	single	 big 	 gest 	 	 less 	 on 	 	i	took	from	my	journey	.
there	's	a	quote	from	moses	on	the	side	of	the	 liber 	 ty 	 	bell	,	and	it	 come 	 s 	 	from	a	 pass 	 age 	 	in	the	book	of	leviticus	,	that	every	seven	 year 	 s 	 	you	should	let	the	land	lay	 f 	 allow 	 	.
and	every	seven	 set 	 s 	 	of	seven	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	land	 get 	 s 	 	an	extra	year	of	rest	 dur 	 ing 	 	which	time	all	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	are	 re 	 unit 	 ed 	 	and	people	 surround 	 ed 	 	with	the	 one 	 s 	 	they	love	.
that	50th	year	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	jubilee	year	,	and	it	's	the	origin	of	that	term	.
and	 th 	 ough 	 	i	'm	 s 	 hy 	 	of	50	,	it	 capture 	 s 	 	my	own	experience	.
my	lost	year	was	my	jubilee	year	.
by	 lay 	 ing 	 	 f 	 allow 	 	,	i	 plant 	 ed 	 	the	 seed 	 s 	 	for	a	 health 	 ier 	 	future	and	was	 re 	 unit 	 ed 	 	with	the	 one 	 s 	 	i	love	.
come	the	one	year	 annivers 	 ary 	 	of	my	journey	,	i	went	to	see	my	surgeon	,	dr.	john	healey	--
and	by	the	way	,	healey	,	great	name	for	a	doctor	.
he	's	the	 p 	 resident 	 	of	the	 inter 	 national 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	of	limb	salvage	,	which	is	the	 l 	 east 	 	 euphem 	 istic 	 	term	i	've	ever	heard	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	dr.	healey	,	if	my	 daughter 	 s 	 	come	to	you	one	day	and	say	,	'	what	should	i	learn	from	my	 d 	 addy 	 	's	story	?	'
what	would	you	tell	them	?	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	would	tell	them	what	i	know	,	and	that	is	 every 	 body 	 	dies	,	but	not	 every 	 body 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
i	want	you	to	live	.	``
i	wrote	a	letter	to	my	 girl 	 s 	 	that	 appear 	 s 	 	at	the	end	of	my	book	,	``	the	council	of	 dad 	 s 	 	,	``	and	i	 list 	 ed 	 	these	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	,	a	few	of	which	you	've	heard	here	 to 	 day 	 	:	approach	the	cow	,	pack	your	 flip 	 flop 	 s 	 	,	do	n't	see	the	wall	,	live	the	 question 	 s 	 	,	harvest	 miracle 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	list	--	to	me	it	was	sort	of	like	a	psalm	book	of	living	--	i	 real 	 ized 	 	,	we	may	have	 d 	 one 	 	it	for	our	 girl 	 s 	 	,	but	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 change 	 d 	 	us	.
and	that	is	,	the	secret	of	the	council	of	 dad 	 s 	 	,	is	that	my	wife	and	i	did	 th 	 is 	 	in	an	attempt	to	help	our	 daughter 	 s 	 	,	but	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 change 	 d 	 	us	.

 a 	 s 	 	i	was	going	there	,	i	was	 wonder 	 ing 	 	,	what	would	i	say	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	here	.
