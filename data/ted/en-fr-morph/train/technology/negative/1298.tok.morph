 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	i	have	no	idea	what	we	're	going	to	play	.
i	wo	n't	be	able	to	tell	you	what	it	is	 un 	 til 	 	it	 happen 	 s 	 	.
i	did	n't	 real 	 ize 	 	there	was	going	to	be	a	little	music	before	.
so	i	think	i	'm	going	to	start	with	what	i	just	heard	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	first	of	all	,	let	's	welcome	mr.	jamire	williams	on	the	 drum 	 s 	 	,	burniss	travis	on	the	 bas 	 s 	 	,	and	mr.	christian	 sand 	 s 	 	on	the	piano	.
so	the	 band 	 stand 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	call	it	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 in 	 credible 	 	space	.
it	is	 re 	 ally 	 	a	sacred	space	.
and	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	is	 re 	 ally 	 	sacred	about	it	is	that	you	have	no	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	think	about	the	future	,	or	the	past	.
you	 re 	 ally 	 	are	 al 	 ive 	 	right	here	in	 th 	 is 	 	moment	.
there	are	so	 man 	 y 	 	 decision 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	made	when	you	walk	on	the	 band 	 stand 	 	.
we	had	no	idea	what	key	we	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	play	in	.
in	the	middle	,	we	sort	of	made	our	way	 in 	 to 	 	a	song	 call 	 ed 	 	``	titi	boom	.	``
but	that	could	have	 happen 	 ed 	 	--	 may 	 be 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	not	.
 every 	 one 	 	's	 listen 	 ing 	 	.	we	're	 respond 	 ing 	 	.
you	have	no	time	for	 project 	 ed 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	.
so	the	idea	of	a	 mistak 	 e 	 	:	from	the	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	of	a	jazz	 music 	 ian 	 	,	it	's	 eas 	 ier 	 	to	talk	about	 some 	 one 	 	else	's	 mistak 	 e 	 	.
so	the	way	i	perceive	a	 mistak 	 e 	 	when	i	'm	on	the	 band 	 stand 	 	--	first	of	all	,	we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	see	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	 mistak 	 e 	 	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	 mistak 	 e 	 	lies	in	that	i	'm	not	able	to	perceive	what	it	is	that	 some 	 one 	 	else	did	.
every	``	 mistak 	 e 	 	``	is	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	in	jazz	.
so	it	's	hard	to	even	 de 	 scribe 	 	what	a	funny	note	would	be	.
so	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	if	i	 play 	 ed 	 	a	color	,	like	we	 we 	 re 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	on	a	 pal 	 ette 	 	,	that	 sound 	 ed 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	...
so	if	christian	 play 	 ed 	 	a	note	--	like	play	an	f	.
see	,	these	are	all	right	 in 	 side 	 	of	the	color	 pal 	 ette 	 	.
if	you	 play 	 ed 	 	an	e	.
see	,	these	all	lie	right	 in 	 side 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	general	 emotion 	 al 	 	 pal 	 ette 	 	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 	.
if	you	 play 	 ed 	 	an	f	#	 th 	 ough 	 	,	to	most	people	's	 ear 	 s 	 	,	they	would	perceive	that	 a 	 s 	 	a	 mistak 	 e 	 	.
so	i	'm	going	to	show	you	,	we	're	going	to	play	just	for	a	second	.
and	we	're	going	to	play	on	 th 	 is 	 	 pal 	 ette 	 	.
and	at	some	point	,	christian	will	 introduc 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	note	.
and	we	wo	n't	react	to	it	.
he	'll	 introduc 	 e 	 	it	for	a	second	and	then	i	'll	stop	,	i	'll	talk	for	a	second	.
we	'll	see	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	we	play	with	 th 	 is 	 	 pal 	 ette 	 	.
so	 some 	 one 	 	could	 conceptual 	 ly 	 	perceive	that	 a 	 s 	 	a	 mistak 	 e 	 	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	that	i	would	say	it	was	a	 mistak 	 e 	 	is	in	that	we	did	n't	react	to	it	.
it	was	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	that	was	 mis 	 s 	 ed 	 	.
so	it	's	 un 	 predict 	 able 	 	.	we	'll	paint	 th 	 is 	 	 pal 	 ette 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
he	'll	play	it	.	i	do	n't	know	how	we	'll	react	to	it	,	but	 some 	 thing 	 	will	change	.
we	'll	all	accept	his	 idea 	 s 	 	,	or	not	.
so	you	see	,	he	 play 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	note	.	i	 end 	 ed 	 	up	creating	a	 melo 	 dy 	 	out	of	it	.
the	 text 	 ure 	 	 change 	 d 	 	in	the	 drum 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	time	.
it	got	a	little	bit	more	 rhythm 	 ic 	 	,	a	little	bit	more	 intens 	 e 	 	in	 respons 	 e 	 	to	how	i	 respond 	 ed 	 	to	it	.
so	there	is	no	 mistak 	 e 	 	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	 mistak 	 e 	 	is	if	i	'm	not	aware	,	if	each	individual	 music 	 ian 	 	is	not	aware	and	 accept 	 ing 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	of	his	fellow	band	member	to	 in 	 corporate 	 	the	idea	and	we	do	n't	allow	for	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	.
so	jazz	,	 th 	 is 	 	 band 	 stand 	 	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 pur 	 ifying 	 	experience	.
and	i	know	that	i	speak	for	all	of	us	when	i	tell	you	that	we	do	n't	take	it	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	.
we	know	that	to	be	able	to	come	on	the	 band 	 stand 	 	and	play	music	is	a	 bless 	 ing 	 	.
so	how	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	all	 re 	 late 	 	to	 behavior 	 al 	 	finance	?
well	we	're	jazz	 music 	 ians 	 	,	so	 stereo 	 typical 	 ly 	 	we	do	n't	have	a	great	relationship	to	finance	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	i	just	 want 	 ed 	 	to	sort	of	point	out	the	way	that	we	handle	it	.
and	the	other	dynamic	of	it	is	that	we	do	n't	 micro 	 manage 	 	in	jazz	.
you	have	some	people	who	do	.
but	what	that	 do 	 es 	 	is	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 limit 	 s 	 	the	 art 	 istic 	 	 possibil 	 ities 	 	.
if	i	come	up	and	i	 dict 	 ate 	 	to	the	band	that	i	want	to	play	like	 th 	 is 	 	and	i	want	the	music	to	go	 th 	 is 	 	way	,	and	i	just	jump	right	in	...
ready	,	just	play	some	time	.
one	,	two	,	one	,	two	,	three	,	four	.
it	's	kind	of	chaotic	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	 bull 	 y 	 ing 	 	my	 idea 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	 tell 	 ing 	 	them	,	``	you	come	with	me	over	 th 	 is 	 	way	.	``
if	i	 re 	 ally 	 	want	the	music	to	go	there	,	the	best	way	for	me	to	do	it	is	to	listen	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	science	of	 listen 	 ing 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	far	more	to	do	with	what	i	can	perceive	than	what	it	is	that	i	can	do	.
so	if	i	want	the	music	to	get	to	a	certain	level	of	 intens 	 ity 	 	,	the	first	step	for	me	is	to	be	patient	,	to	listen	to	what	's	going	on	and	pull	from	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	going	on	around	me	.
when	you	do	that	,	you	engage	and	inspire	the	other	 music 	 ians 	 	and	they	give	you	more	,	and	 gradu 	 ally 	 	it	 build 	 s 	 	.
watch	.	one	,	two	,	a	one	,	two	,	three	,	four	.
 total 	 ly 	 	different	experience	when	i	'm	 pull 	 ing 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	.
it	's	much	more	 organ 	 ic 	 	.	it	's	much	more	 nuance 	 d 	 	.
it	's	not	about	 bull 	 y 	 ing 	 	my	vision	or	 any 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
it	's	about	 be 	 ing 	 	here	in	the	moment	,	 accept 	 ing 	 	one	 an 	 other 	 	and	 allow 	 ing 	 	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	to	flow	.
thank	you	.
