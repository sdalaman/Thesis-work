do	you	know	how	 man 	 y 	 	species	of	 flower 	 ing 	 	 plant 	 s 	 	there	are	?
there	are	a	quarter	of	a	million	--	at	 l 	 east 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	 one 	 s 	 	we	know	about	--	a	quarter	of	a	million	species	of	 flower 	 ing 	 	 plant 	 s 	 	.
and	 flower 	 s 	 	are	a	real	bugger	.
they	're	 re 	 ally 	 	difficult	for	 plant 	 s 	 	to	produce	.
they	take	an	enormous	amount	of	energy	and	a	lot	of	 resource 	 s 	 	.
why	would	they	go	to	that	 both 	 er 	 	?
and	the	answer	of	course	,	like	so	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	in	the	world	,	is	 s 	 ex 	 	.
i	know	what	's	on	your	mind	when	you	're	looking	at	these	 picture 	 s 	 	.
and	the	reason	that	sexual	 re 	 production 	 	is	so	 import 	 ant 	 	--
there	are	 lot 	 s 	 	of	other	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 plant 	 s 	 	can	do	to	 re 	 produce 	 	.
you	can	take	 cutting 	 s 	 	;	they	can	sort	of	have	 s 	 ex 	 	with	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	;	they	can	 pollinat 	 e 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
but	they	 re 	 ally 	 	need	to	spread	 the 	 ir 	 	 gene 	 s 	 	to	mix	with	other	 gene 	 s 	 	so	that	they	can	adapt	to	 environment 	 al 	 	 niche 	 s 	 	.
evolution	 work 	 s 	 	that	way	.
now	the	way	that	 plant 	 s 	 	transmit	that	information	is	through	 poll 	 en 	 	.
some	of	you	may	have	 s 	 een 	 	some	of	these	 picture 	 s 	 	before	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	say	,	every	home	should	have	a	 s 	 canning 	 	electron	 micro 	 scope 	 	to	be	able	to	see	these	.
and	there	is	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 poll 	 en 	 	 a 	 s 	 	there	are	 flower 	 ing 	 	 plant 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	for	 forensic 	 s 	 	and	so	on	.
most	 poll 	 en 	 	that	 cause 	 s 	 	hay	 f 	 ever 	 	for	us	is	from	 plant 	 s 	 	that	use	the	wind	to	disseminate	the	 poll 	 en 	 	,
and	that	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 in 	 efficient 	 	process	,	which	is	why	it	 get 	 s 	 	up	our	 nose 	 s 	 	so	much	.
 be 	 cause 	 	you	have	to	chuck	out	 masse 	 s 	 	and	 masse 	 s 	 	of	it	,	 hop 	 ing 	 	that	your	 s 	 ex 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	,	your	male	 s 	 ex 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	,	which	are	held	 with 	 in 	 	the	 poll 	 en 	 	,	will	 some 	 how 	 	reach	 an 	 other 	 	flower	just	by	chance	.
so	all	the	 grass 	 es 	 	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	all	of	the	 ce 	 real 	 	 crop 	 s 	 	,	and	most	of	the	 tree 	 s 	 	have	wind	-	borne	 poll 	 en 	 	.
but	most	species	 actual 	 ly 	 	use	 insect 	 s 	 	to	do	 the 	 ir 	 	 bid 	 d 	 ing 	 	,
and	that	's	more	intelligent	in	a	way	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 poll 	 en 	 	,	they	do	n't	need	so	much	of	it	.
the	 insect 	 s 	 	and	other	species	can	take	the	 poll 	 en 	 	,	transfer	it	 direct 	 ly 	 	to	where	it	's	 requir 	 ed 	 	.
so	we	're	aware	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	of	the	relationship	between	 insect 	 s 	 	and	 plant 	 s 	 	.
there	's	a	 sym 	 biotic 	 	relationship	there	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	flies	or	 bird 	 s 	 	or	bees	,	they	're	 get 	 ting 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	in	return	,	and	that	 some 	 thing 	 	in	return	is	 general 	 ly 	 	nectar	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	that	 sym 	 bio 	 sis 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	led	to	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 adapt 	 ations 	 	--
the	 humming 	 bird 	 	hawk	-	moth	is	 beaut 	 iful 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	 adapt 	 ation 	 	.
the	plant	 get 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	,	and	the	hawk	-	moth	 spread 	 s 	 	the	 poll 	 en 	 	 some 	 where 	 	else	.
 plant 	 s 	 	have	 evolv 	 ed 	 	to	create	little	 land 	 ing 	 	 strip 	 s 	 	here	and	there	for	bees	that	might	have	lost	 the 	 ir 	 	way	.
there	are	 mark 	 ing 	 s 	 	on	 man 	 y 	 	 plant 	 s 	 	that	look	like	other	 insect 	 s 	 	.
these	are	the	 anther 	 s 	 	of	a	 li 	 ly 	 	,	 clever 	 ly 	 	 d 	 one 	 	so	that	when	the	 un 	 suspect 	 ing 	 	insect	 land 	 s 	 	on	it	,	the	anther	 flip 	 s 	 	up	and	 who 	 ps 	 	it	on	the	back	with	a	great	load	of	 poll 	 en 	 	that	it	then	 go 	 es 	 	to	 an 	 other 	 	plant	with	.
and	there	's	an	orchid	that	might	look	to	you	 a 	 s 	 	if	it	's	got	 jaw 	 s 	 	,
and	in	a	way	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	;	it	 force 	 s 	 	the	insect	to	crawl	out	,	 get 	 ting 	 	 cover 	 ed 	 	in	 poll 	 en 	 	that	it	 take 	 s 	 	 some 	 where 	 	else	.
 orchid 	 s 	 	:	there	are	20,000	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	,	species	of	 orchid 	 s 	 	--	 amaz 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	 amaz 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 divers 	 e 	 	.
and	they	get	up	to	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 trick 	 s 	 	.
they	have	to	try	and	attract	 pollinat 	 ors 	 	to	do	 the 	 ir 	 	 bid 	 d 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	orchid	,	known	 a 	 s 	 	darwin	's	orchid	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	one	that	he	 stud 	 ied 	 	and	made	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 predict 	 ion 	 	when	he	saw	it	--
you	can	see	that	there	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	long	nectar	tube	that	 descend 	 s 	 	down	from	the	orchid	.
and	 bas 	 ically 	 	what	the	insect	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	--	we	're	in	the	middle	of	the	flower	--	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	stick	 it 	 s 	 	little	 prob 	 os 	 cis 	 	right	 in 	 to 	 	the	middle	of	that	and	all	the	way	down	that	nectar	tube	to	get	to	the	nectar	.
and	darwin	 s 	 aid 	 	,	looking	at	 th 	 is 	 	flower	,	``	i	guess	 some 	 thing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 co 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	.	``	and	 s 	 ure 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	there	's	the	insect	.
and	i	mean	,	 normal 	 ly 	 	it	kind	of	 roll 	 s 	 	it	away	,	but	in	 it 	 s 	 	erect	form	,	that	's	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
now	you	can	imagine	that	if	nectar	is	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 valu 	 able 	 	thing	and	expensive	for	the	plant	to	produce	and	it	 attract 	 s 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 pollinat 	 ors 	 	,	then	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	in	human	 s 	 ex 	 	,	people	might	start	to	deceive	.
they	might	say	,	``	i	've	got	a	bit	of	nectar	.	do	you	want	to	come	and	get	it	?	``	now	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	plant	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	plant	here	that	 insect 	 s 	 	in	south	africa	just	love	,
and	they	've	 evolv 	 ed 	 	with	a	long	 prob 	 os 	 cis 	 	to	get	the	nectar	at	the	bottom	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	mimic	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	plant	that	is	 mimic 	 king 	 	the	first	plant	.
and	here	is	the	long	-	probosced	fly	that	 ha 	 s 	 	not	gotten	any	nectar	from	the	mimic	,
 be 	 cause 	 	the	mimic	 do 	 es 	 	n't	give	it	any	nectar	.	it	thought	it	would	get	some	.
so	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	the	fly	not	got	the	nectar	from	the	mimic	plant	,	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	--	if	you	look	 ver 	 y 	 	 close 	 ly 	 	just	at	the	head	end	,	you	can	see	that	it	's	got	a	bit	of	 poll 	 en 	 	that	it	would	be	 transmit 	 ting 	 	to	 an 	 other 	 	plant	,	if	 on 	 ly 	 	some	botanist	had	n't	come	 a 	 long 	 	and	 s 	 tuck 	 	it	to	a	blue	piece	of	card	.
now	deceit	 car 	 ries 	 	on	through	the	plant	 king 	 dom 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	flower	with	 it 	 s 	 	black	 dot 	 s 	 	:	they	might	look	like	black	 dot 	 s 	 	to	us	,	but	if	i	tell	you	,	to	a	male	insect	of	the	right	species	,	that	 look 	 s 	 	like	two	 female 	 s 	 	who	are	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	hot	to	 t 	 rot 	 	.
and	when	the	insect	 get 	 s 	 	there	and	 land 	 s 	 	on	it	,	 d 	 ous 	 ing 	 	 it 	 self 	 	in	 poll 	 en 	 	,	of	course	,	that	it	's	going	to	take	to	 an 	 other 	 	plant	,	if	you	look	at	the	every	-	home	-	should	-	have	-	one	 s 	 canning 	 	electron	 micro 	 scope 	 	picture	,	you	can	see	that	there	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	some	 pattern 	 ing 	 	there	,	which	is	three	-	dimensional	.
so	it	 prob 	 ably 	 	even	 feel 	 s 	 	good	for	the	insect	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	looking	good	.
and	these	electron	 micro 	 scope 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	--	here	's	one	of	an	orchid	 mimic 	 king 	 	an	insect	--
you	can	see	that	different	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	structure	have	different	 color 	 s 	 	and	different	 text 	 ures 	 	to	our	eye	,	have	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	different	 text 	 ures 	 	to	what	an	insect	might	perceive	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	one	is	 evolv 	 ed 	 	to	mimic	a	 gloss 	 y 	 	 metal 	 lic 	 	surface	you	see	on	some	 beetle 	 s 	 	.
and	under	the	 s 	 canning 	 	electron	 micro 	 scope 	 	,	you	can	see	the	surface	there	--	 re 	 ally 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	different	from	the	other	 surface 	 s 	 	we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	the	whole	plant	 mimic 	 s 	 	an	insect	,	even	to	us	.
i	mean	,	i	think	that	 look 	 s 	 	like	some	sort	of	 fly 	 ing 	 	animal	or	beast	.
it	's	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	,	 amaz 	 ing 	 	thing	.
 th 	 is 	 	one	's	clever	.	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	 ob 	 sid 	 ian 	 	.
i	think	of	it	 a 	 s 	 	 insid 	 ium 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	.
to	the	right	species	of	bee	,	 th 	 is 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	 an 	 other 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 aggress 	 ive 	 	bee	,	and	it	 go 	 es 	 	and	 bon 	 k 	 s 	 	it	on	the	head	 lot 	 s 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 time 	 s 	 	to	try	and	drive	it	away	,	and	,	of	course	,	 cover 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	with	 poll 	 en 	 	.
the	other	thing	it	 do 	 es 	 	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	plant	 mimic 	 s 	 	 an 	 other 	 	orchid	that	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	store	of	food	for	 insect 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	one	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	 any 	 thing 	 	for	them	.
so	it	's	 de 	 ceiv 	 ing 	 	on	two	 level 	 s 	 	--
fabulous	.
here	we	see	 y 	 l 	 ang 	 	 y 	 l 	 ang 	 	,	the	component	of	 man 	 y 	 	 perfume 	 s 	 	.
i	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 melt 	 	 some 	 one 	 	with	some	on	 ear 	 lier 	 	.
and	the	 flower 	 s 	 	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	have	to	be	that	 g 	 au 	 dy 	 	.
they	're	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	out	a	fantastic	array	of	 s 	 cent 	 	to	any	insect	that	'll	have	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	one	 do 	 es 	 	n't	smell	so	good	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	flower	that	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 smell 	 s 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	nasty	and	is	designed	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 evolv 	 ed 	 	,	to	look	like	 car 	 r 	 ion 	 	.
so	flies	love	 th 	 is 	 	.
they	fly	in	and	they	 pollinat 	 e 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	,	which	is	helicodiceros	,	is	 al 	 so 	 	known	 a 	 s 	 	dead	horse	 ar 	 um 	 	.
i	do	n't	know	what	a	dead	horse	 actual 	 ly 	 	 smell 	 s 	 	like	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	one	 prob 	 ably 	 	 smell 	 s 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	like	it	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 horr 	 ible 	 	.
and	 blow 	 flies 	 	just	ca	n't	help	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
they	fly	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	thing	,	and	they	fly	all	the	way	down	it	.
they	lay	 the 	 ir 	 	 egg 	 s 	 	in	it	,	 think 	 ing 	 	it	's	a	nice	bit	of	 car 	 r 	 ion 	 	,	and	not	 real 	 izing 	 	that	there	's	no	food	for	the	 egg 	 s 	 	,	that	the	 egg 	 s 	 	are	going	to	die	,	but	the	plant	,	 mean 	 while 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 benefit 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 br 	 ist 	 les 	 	 re 	 lease 	 	and	the	flies	disappear	to	 pollinat 	 e 	 	the	next	flower	--	fantastic	.
here	's	 ar 	 um 	 	,	 ar 	 um 	 	maculatum	,	``	 lord 	 s 	 	and	 lad 	 ies 	 	,	``	or	``	cuckoo	-	pint	``	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	.
i	 photograph 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	thing	last	week	in	dorset	.
 th 	 is 	 	thing	 heat 	 s 	 	up	by	about	15	 degree 	 s 	 	above	 ambi 	 ent 	 	temperature	--
 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
and	if	you	look	down	 in 	 to 	 	it	,	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	dam	past	the	spadix	,	flies	get	 attract 	 ed 	 	by	the	heat	--	which	is	 boil 	 ing 	 	off	 volatil 	 e 	 	 chemical 	 s 	 	,	little	 mid 	 ge 	 s 	 	--	and	they	get	trapped	 under 	 neath 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 contain 	 er 	 	.
they	drink	 th 	 is 	 	fabulous	nectar	and	then	they	're	all	a	bit	 stick 	 y 	 	.
at	night	they	get	 cover 	 ed 	 	in	 poll 	 en 	 	,	which	 shower 	 s 	 	down	over	them	,	and	then	the	 br 	 ist 	 les 	 	that	we	saw	above	,	they	sort	of	wilt	and	allow	all	these	 mid 	 ge 	 s 	 	out	,	 cover 	 ed 	 	in	 poll 	 en 	 	--
fabulous	thing	.
now	if	you	think	that	's	fabulous	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	my	great	 favor 	 ites 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 phil 	 o 	 dendron 	 	 sell 	 o 	 um 	 	.
for	 any 	 one 	 	here	from	brazil	,	you	'll	know	about	 th 	 is 	 	plant	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	most	 amaz 	 ing 	 	thing	.
that	sort	of	 phal 	 lic 	 	bit	there	is	about	a	foot	long	.
and	it	 do 	 es 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	no	other	plant	that	i	know	of	 do 	 es 	 	,	and	that	is	that	when	it	 flower 	 s 	 	--	that	's	the	spadix	in	the	middle	there	--	for	a	period	of	about	two	 day 	 s 	 	,	it	 metabol 	 ize 	 s 	 	in	a	way	which	is	 ra 	 ther 	 	similar	to	 mammal 	 s 	 	.
so	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	starch	,	which	is	the	food	of	 plant 	 s 	 	,	it	 take 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	similar	to	 brow 	 n 	 	fat	and	 burn 	 s 	 	it	at	 s 	 uch 	 	a	rate	that	it	's	 burn 	 ing 	 	fat	,	 metabol 	 izing 	 	,	about	the	rate	of	a	small	cat	.
and	that	's	twice	the	energy	 out 	 put 	 	,	weight	for	weight	,	than	a	 humming 	 bird 	 	--
 absolute 	 ly 	 	 astonish 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	thing	 do 	 es 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	else	which	is	 un 	 usual 	 	.
not	 on 	 ly 	 	will	it	raise	 it 	 self 	 	to	115	fahrenheit	,	43	or	44	 degree 	 s 	 	 cent 	 i 	 grade 	 	,	for	two	 day 	 s 	 	,	but	it	 keep 	 s 	 	constant	temperature	.
there	's	a	 thermo 	 regulat 	 ion 	 	 mechan 	 ism 	 	in	there	that	 keep 	 s 	 	constant	temperature	.
``	now	why	 do 	 es 	 	it	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	``	i	hear	you	ask	.
now	would	n't	you	know	it	,	there	's	some	 beetle 	 s 	 	that	just	love	to	make	love	at	that	temperature	.
and	they	get	 in 	 side 	 	,	and	they	get	it	all	on	.
and	the	plant	 shower 	 s 	 	them	with	 poll 	 en 	 	,	and	off	they	go	and	 pollinat 	 e 	 	.
and	what	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	thing	it	is	.
now	most	 pollinat 	 ors 	 	that	we	think	about	are	 insect 	 s 	 	,	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	in	the	 tropic 	 s 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 bird 	 s 	 	and	 butter 	 flies 	 	 pollinat 	 e 	 	.
and	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 tropic 	 al 	 	 flower 	 s 	 	are	red	,	and	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	 butter 	 flies 	 	and	 bird 	 s 	 	see	 similar 	 ly 	 	to	us	,	we	think	,	and	can	see	the	color	red	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.
but	if	you	look	at	the	spectrum	,	 bird 	 s 	 	and	us	,	we	see	red	,	green	and	blue	and	see	that	spectrum	.
 insect 	 s 	 	see	green	,	blue	and	 ultra 	 viol 	 et 	 	,	and	they	see	 vari 	 ous 	 	 sha 	 de 	 s 	 	of	 ultra 	 viol 	 et 	 	.
so	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 go 	 es 	 	on	off	the	end	there	.
``	and	would	n't	it	be	great	if	we	could	 some 	 how 	 	see	what	that	is	,	``	i	hear	you	ask	.
well	 y 	 es 	 	we	can	.
so	what	is	an	insect	 see 	 ing 	 	?
last	week	i	took	these	 picture 	 s 	 	of	rock	rose	,	 hel 	 ian 	 the 	 mum 	 	,	in	dorset	.
these	are	little	yellow	 flower 	 s 	 	like	we	all	see	,	little	yellow	 flower 	 s 	 	all	over	the	place	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	with	visible	light	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	if	you	take	out	the	red	.
most	bees	do	n't	perceive	red	.
and	then	i	put	some	 ultra 	 viol 	 et 	 	 filter 	 s 	 	on	my	camera	and	took	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	long	 expo 	 s 	 ure 	 	with	the	 part 	 icular 	 	 fr 	 equ 	 encies 	 	of	 ultra 	 viol 	 et 	 	light	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	got	.
and	that	's	a	real	fantastic	bull	's	eye	.
now	we	do	n't	know	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	a	bee	 s 	 ees 	 	,	any	more	than	you	know	what	i	'm	 see 	 ing 	 	when	i	call	 th 	 is 	 	red	.
we	ca	n't	know	what	's	going	on	in	--	let	 al 	 one 	 	an	insect	's	--	 an 	 other 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 	's	mind	.
but	the	contrast	will	look	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	,
so	 stand 	 ing 	 	out	a	lot	from	the	 back 	 ground 	 	.
here	's	 an 	 other 	 	little	flower	--	different	range	of	 ultra 	 viol 	 et 	 	 fr 	 equ 	 encies 	 	,	different	 filter 	 s 	 	to	match	the	 pollinat 	 ors 	 	.
and	that	's	the	sort	of	thing	that	it	would	be	 see 	 ing 	 	.
just	in	case	you	think	that	all	yellow	 flower 	 s 	 	have	 th 	 is 	 	 proper 	 ty 	 	--	no	flower	was	 damage 	 d 	 	in	the	process	of	 th 	 is 	 	shot	;	it	was	just	 attach 	 ed 	 	to	the	 tri 	 pod 	 	,	not	 kill 	 ed 	 	--
then	under	 ultra 	 viol 	 et 	 	light	,	look	at	that	.
and	that	could	be	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	a	 s 	 un 	 screen 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 s 	 un 	 screen 	 s 	 	work	by	 absorb 	 ing 	 	 ultra 	 viol 	 et 	 	light	.
so	 may 	 be 	 	the	chemical	in	that	would	be	 use 	 ful 	 	.
 final 	 ly 	 	,	there	's	one	of	 even 	 ing 	 	 prim 	 rose 	 	that	bjorn	rorslett	from	norway	 s 	 ent 	 	me	--	fantastic	 hid 	 den 	 	pattern	.
and	i	love	the	idea	of	 some 	 thing 	 	 hid 	 den 	 	.
i	think	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	 poet 	 ic 	 	here	,	that	these	 picture 	 s 	 	taken	with	 ultra 	 viol 	 et 	 	filter	,	the	main	use	of	that	filter	is	for	 astronomer 	 s 	 	to	take	 picture 	 s 	 	of	venus	--
 actual 	 ly 	 	the	 cloud 	 s 	 	of	venus	.
that	's	the	main	use	of	that	filter	.
venus	,	of	course	,	is	the	god	of	love	and	 fertil 	 ity 	 	,	which	is	the	flower	story	.
and	just	 a 	 s 	 	 flower 	 s 	 	 s 	 pend 	 	a	lot	of	effort	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	 pollinat 	 ors 	 	to	do	 the 	 ir 	 	 bid 	 d 	 ing 	 	,	they	've	 al 	 so 	 	 some 	 how 	 	 manage 	 d 	 	to	 persuad 	 e 	 	us	to	plant	great	 field 	 s 	 	full	of	them	and	give	them	to	each	other	at	 time 	 s 	 	of	birth	and	death	,	and	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	at	marriage	,	which	,	when	you	think	of	it	,	is	the	moment	that	 encapsul 	 ates 	 	the	transfer	of	genetic	material	from	one	organism	to	 an 	 other 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
