i	'm	not	 quit 	 e 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	i	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	see	a	snare	drum	at	nine	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	or	so	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
but	 any 	 way 	 	,	it	's	just	great	to	see	 s 	 uch 	 	a	full	theater	,	and	 re 	 ally 	 	i	must	thank	herbie	hancock	and	his	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	for	 s 	 uch 	 	a	great	 present 	 ation 	 	.
one	of	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	of	course	,	is	the	combination	of	that	raw	hand	on	the	instrument	and	technology	,	and	of	course	what	he	 s 	 aid 	 	about	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	our	young	people	.
of	course	,	my	job	is	all	about	 listen 	 ing 	 	,	and	my	aim	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	is	to	teach	the	world	to	listen	.
that	's	my	 on 	 ly 	 	real	aim	in	life	.
and	it	 sound 	 s 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	simple	,	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	a	big	,	big	job	.
 be 	 cause 	 	you	know	,	when	you	look	at	a	piece	of	music	--	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	if	i	just	open	my	little	 motor 	 bike 	 	bag	--	we	have	here	,	 hope 	 fully 	 	,	a	piece	of	music	that	is	full	of	little	black	 dot 	 s 	 	on	the	page	.
and	,	you	know	,	we	open	it	up	and	i	read	the	music	.
so	 technical 	 ly 	 	,	i	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	read	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	will	follow	the	 instruct 	 ions 	 	,	the	tempo	 mark 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	the	 dynamic 	 s 	 	.
i	will	do	 exact 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	i	'm	told	.
and	so	 there 	 fore 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	time	is	short	,	if	i	just	play	you	 liter 	 ally 	 	the	first	 may 	 be 	 	two	lines	or	so	.	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 straight 	 forward 	 	.
there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	too	difficult	about	the	piece	.
but	here	i	'm	 be 	 ing 	 	told	that	the	piece	of	music	is	 ver 	 y 	 	quick	.
i	'm	 be 	 ing 	 	told	where	to	play	on	the	drum	.
i	'm	 be 	 ing 	 	told	which	part	of	the	stick	to	use	.
and	i	'm	 be 	 ing 	 	told	the	dynamic	.
and	i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	told	that	the	drum	is	 with 	 out 	 	 snare 	 s 	 	.
 snare 	 s 	 	on	,	 snare 	 s 	 	off	.
so	 there 	 fore 	 	,	if	i	 transl 	 ate 	 	 th 	 is 	 	piece	of	music	,	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	idea	.
and	so	on	.	my	 care 	 er 	 	would	 prob 	 ably 	 	last	about	five	 year 	 s 	 	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	what	i	have	to	do	 a 	 s 	 	a	 music 	 ian 	 	is	do	 every 	 thing 	 	that	is	not	on	the	music	.
 every 	 thing 	 	that	there	is	n't	time	to	learn	from	a	teacher	,	or	to	talk	about	,	even	,	from	a	teacher	.
but	it	's	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	notice	when	you	're	not	 actual 	 ly 	 	with	your	instrument	that	in	fact	 be 	 come 	 	so	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	and	that	you	want	to	explore	through	 th 	 is 	 	 tin 	 y 	 	,	 tin 	 y 	 	surface	of	a	drum	.
so	there	,	we	experience	the	 transl 	 ation 	 	.	now	we	'll	experience	the	 interpret 	 ation 	 	.
now	my	 care 	 er 	 	may	last	a	little	 long 	 er 	 	!
but	in	a	way	,	you	know	,	it	's	the	same	if	i	look	at	you	and	i	see	a	nice	bright	young	 lad 	 y 	 	with	a	pink	top	on	.
i	see	that	you	're	 clutch 	 ing 	 	a	 ted 	 dy 	 	bear	,	etc	.	,	etc	.
so	i	get	a	 bas 	 ic 	 	idea	 a 	 s 	 	to	what	you	might	be	about	,	what	you	might	like	,	what	you	might	do	 a 	 s 	 	a	profession	,	etc	.	,	etc	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	that	's	just	,	you	know	,	the	 initi 	 al 	 	idea	i	may	have	that	we	all	get	when	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	look	,	and	we	try	to	interpret	,	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	it	's	so	 un 	 believ 	 ably 	 	 sh 	 allow 	 	.
in	the	same	way	,	i	look	at	the	music	;	i	get	a	 bas 	 ic 	 	idea	;	i	wonder	what	 technical 	 ly 	 	might	be	hard	,	or	,	you	know	,	what	i	want	to	do	.
just	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	that	is	 simpl 	 y 	 	not	 en 	 ough 	 	.
and	i	think	what	herbie	 s 	 aid 	 	--	 pleas 	 e 	 	listen	,	listen	.
we	have	to	listen	to	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	first	of	all	.
if	i	play	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 hold 	 ing 	 	the	stick	--	where	 liter 	 ally 	 	i	do	not	let	go	of	the	stick	--	you	'll	experience	 quit 	 e 	 	a	lot	of	shock	coming	up	through	the	arm	.
and	you	feel	 re 	 ally 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	--	 believ 	 e 	 	it	or	not	--	 detach 	 ed 	 	from	the	instrument	and	from	the	stick	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	i	'm	 actual 	 ly 	 	 hold 	 ing 	 	the	stick	 quit 	 e 	 	 tight 	 ly 	 	.
by	 hold 	 ing 	 	it	 tight 	 ly 	 	,	i	feel	 strange 	 ly 	 	more	 detach 	 ed 	 	.
if	i	just	 simpl 	 y 	 	let	go	and	allow	my	hand	,	my	arm	,	to	be	more	of	a	support	system	,	 sudden 	 ly 	 	i	have	more	dynamic	with	less	effort	.	much	more	.
and	i	just	feel	,	at	last	,	one	with	the	stick	and	one	with	the	drum	.
and	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	far	,	far	less	.
so	in	the	same	way	that	i	need	time	with	 th 	 is 	 	instrument	,	i	need	time	with	people	in	order	to	interpret	them	.
not	just	 transl 	 ate 	 	them	,	but	interpret	them	.
if	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	i	play	just	a	few	 bar 	 s 	 	of	a	piece	of	music	for	which	i	think	of	 my 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	technician	--	that	is	,	 some 	 one 	 	who	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	a	 percuss 	 ion 	 	player	...
and	so	on	.	if	i	think	of	 my 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 music 	 ian 	 	...
and	so	on	.	there	is	a	little	bit	of	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	there	that	is	worth	just	--	--	 think 	 ing 	 	about	.
and	i	remember	when	i	was	12	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	tympani	and	 percuss 	 ion 	 	,	and	my	teacher	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	how	are	we	going	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	?	you	know	,	music	is	about	 listen 	 ing 	 	.	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	i	agree	with	that	.	so	what	's	the	problem	?	``
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	how	are	you	going	to	hear	 th 	 is 	 	?	how	are	you	going	to	hear	that	?	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	how	do	you	hear	it	?	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	i	think	i	hear	it	through	here	.	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	i	think	i	do	too	--	but	i	 al 	 so 	 	hear	it	through	my	 hand 	 s 	 	,	through	my	 arm 	 s 	 	,	 cheek 	 bone 	 s 	 	,	my	scalp	,	my	tummy	,	my	chest	,	my	 leg 	 s 	 	and	so	on	.	``
and	so	we	 beg 	 an 	 	our	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	every	single	time	 t 	 un 	 ing 	 	 drum 	 s 	 	--	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	the	 ke 	 ttle 	 	 drum 	 s 	 	,	or	tympani	--	to	 s 	 uch 	 	a	narrow	pitch	 inter 	 val 	 	,	so	 some 	 thing 	 	like	...
that	of	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	.	then	 gradu 	 ally 	 	...	and	 gradu 	 ally 	 	...
and	it	's	 amaz 	 ing 	 	that	when	you	do	open	your	body	up	,	and	open	your	hand	up	to	allow	the	vibration	to	come	through	,	that	in	fact	the	 tin 	 y 	 	,	 tin 	 y 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 	...
can	be	felt	with	just	the	 tin 	 iest 	 	part	of	your	finger	,	there	.
and	so	what	we	would	do	is	that	i	would	put	my	 hand 	 s 	 	on	the	wall	of	the	music	room	,	and	together	we	would	``	listen	``	to	the	 sound 	 s 	 	of	the	 instrument 	 s 	 	,	and	 re 	 ally 	 	try	to	connect	with	 t 	 hose 	 	 sound 	 s 	 	far	,	far	more	 broad 	 ly 	 	than	 simpl 	 y 	 	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	the	ear	.
 be 	 cause 	 	of	course	,	the	ear	is	,	i	mean	,	subject	to	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
the	room	we	happen	to	be	in	,	the	 ampl 	 ification 	 	,	the	quality	of	the	instrument	,	the	type	of	 stick 	 s 	 	...	etc	.	,	etc	.
they	're	all	different	.
same	amount	of	weight	,	but	different	sound	 color 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	what	we	are	.	we	're	just	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	but	we	all	have	our	own	little	sound	 color 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 we 	 re 	 	,	that	make	up	these	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 personal 	 ities 	 	and	 character 	 s 	 	and	 interest 	 s 	 	and	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	grew	 old 	 er 	 	,	i	then	 audition 	 ed 	 	for	the	royal	academy	of	music	in	london	,	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	no	,	we	wo	n't	accept	you	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	n't	a	clue	,	you	know	,	of	the	future	of	a	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	'	deaf	'	 music 	 ian 	 	.	``
and	i	just	could	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	accept	that	.
and	so	 there 	 fore 	 	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	to	them	,	``	well	,	look	,	if	you	 re 	 fuse 	 	--	if	you	 re 	 fuse 	 	me	through	 t 	 hose 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	the	ability	to	perform	and	to	understand	and	love	the	art	of	creating	sound	--	then	we	have	to	think	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	about	the	people	you	do	 actual 	 ly 	 	accept	.	``
and	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	--	once	we	got	over	a	little	hurdle	,	and	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	audition	twice	--	they	 accept 	 ed 	 	me	.	and	not	 on 	 ly 	 	that	--	what	had	 happen 	 ed 	 	was	that	it	 change 	 d 	 	the	whole	role	of	the	music	 institution 	 s 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 king 	 dom 	 	.
under	no	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	they	to	 re 	 fuse 	 	any	application	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	on	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	 whet 	 her 	 	 some 	 one 	 	had	no	 arm 	 s 	 	,	no	 leg 	 s 	 	--	they	could	still	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	play	a	wind	instrument	if	it	was	 support 	 ed 	 	on	a	stand	.
no	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	at	all	 we 	 re 	 	used	to	 re 	 fuse 	 	any	entry	.
and	every	single	entry	had	to	be	 listen 	 ed 	 	to	,	 experience 	 d 	 	and	then	based	on	the	musical	ability	--	then	that	person	could	either	enter	or	not	.
so	 there 	 fore 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	in	turn	 me 	 ant 	 	that	there	was	an	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	bunch	of	 student 	 s 	 	who	 arriv 	 ed 	 	in	these	 vari 	 ous 	 	music	 institution 	 s 	 	.
and	i	have	to	say	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	them	now	in	the	professional	 orchestra 	 s 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	world	.
the	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	about	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	 th 	 ough 	 	--	--	is	 quit 	 e 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	that	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 we 	 re 	 	people	 connect 	 ed 	 	with	sound	--	which	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	all	of	us	,	and	we	well	know	that	music	 re 	 ally 	 	is	our	 dai 	 ly 	 	medicine	.
i	say	``	music	,	``	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	i	mean	``	sound	.	``
 be 	 cause 	 	you	know	,	some	of	the	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	i	've	 experience 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 music 	 ian 	 	,	when	you	may	have	a	15	-	year	-	old	lad	who	 ha 	 s 	 	got	the	most	 in 	 credible 	 	 challeng 	 es 	 	,	who	may	not	be	able	to	control	his	 move 	 ments 	 	,	who	may	be	deaf	,	who	may	be	blind	,	etc	.	,	etc	.	--
 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	if	that	young	lad	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	close	to	 th 	 is 	 	instrument	,	and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	even	lies	 under 	 neath 	 	the	marimba	,	and	you	play	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	so	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	organ	-	like	,	 al 	 most 	 	--	i	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	have	the	right	 stick 	 s 	 	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	--	but	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.	let	me	change	.
 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	so	 un 	 believ 	 ably 	 	simple	--	but	he	would	be	 ex 	 peri 	 encing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	would	n't	be	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	on	top	of	the	sound	.
i	have	the	sound	coming	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
he	would	have	the	sound	coming	through	the	 reson 	 ators 	 	.
if	there	 we 	 re 	 	no	 reson 	 ators 	 	on	here	,	we	would	have	...	so	he	would	have	a	 full 	 ness 	 	of	sound	that	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	in	the	front	few	 row 	 s 	 	would	n't	experience	,	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	in	the	back	few	 row 	 s 	 	would	n't	experience	either	.
every	single	one	of	us	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	where	we	're	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	,	will	experience	 th 	 is 	 	sound	 quit 	 e 	 	,	 quit 	 e 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	.
and	of	course	,	 be 	 ing 	 	the	 particip 	 ator 	 	of	the	sound	,	and	that	is	 start 	 ing 	 	from	the	idea	of	what	type	of	sound	i	want	to	produce	--	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	sound	.
can	you	hear	 any 	 thing 	 	?
 exact 	 ly 	 	.	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	not	even	 touch 	 ing 	 	it	.
but	yet	,	we	get	the	 sens 	 ation 	 	of	 some 	 thing 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
in	the	same	way	that	when	i	see	tree	 move 	 s 	 	,	then	i	imagine	that	tree	making	a	 rust 	 ling 	 	sound	.
do	you	see	what	i	mean	?
 what 	 ever 	 	the	eye	 s 	 ees 	 	,	then	there	's	 al 	 ways 	 	sound	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
so	there	's	 al 	 ways 	 	,	 al 	 ways 	 	that	huge	--	i	mean	,	just	 th 	 is 	 	 kale 	 ido 	 scope 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	to	draw	from	.
so	all	of	my	 performance 	 s 	 	are	based	on	 entire 	 ly 	 	what	i	experience	,	and	not	by	 learn 	 ing 	 	a	piece	of	music	,	 put 	 ting 	 	on	 some 	 one 	 	else	's	 interpret 	 ation 	 	of	it	,	 buy 	 ing 	 	all	the	cds	possible	of	that	 part 	 icular 	 	piece	of	music	,	and	so	on	and	so	forth	.
 be 	 cause 	 	that	is	n't	giving	me	 en 	 ough 	 	of	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	so	raw	and	so	 bas 	 ic 	 	,	and	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	can	fully	experience	the	journey	of	.
so	it	may	be	that	,	in	certain	 hall 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	dynamic	may	well	work	.
it	may	be	that	in	other	 hall 	 s 	 	,	they	're	 simpl 	 y 	 	not	going	to	experience	that	at	all	and	so	 there 	 fore 	 	,	my	level	of	soft	,	gentle	 play 	 ing 	 	may	have	to	be	...	do	you	see	what	i	mean	?	so	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	explosion	in	access	to	sound	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	through	the	deaf	community	,	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 affect 	 ed 	 	how	music	 institution 	 s 	 	,	how	 school 	 s 	 	for	the	deaf	treat	sound	--	and	not	just	 a 	 s 	 	a	 mean 	 s 	 	of	therapy	--	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	of	course	,	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 particip 	 ator 	 	of	music	,	that	 definite 	 ly 	 	is	the	case	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
but	it	's	 me 	 ant 	 	that	 acoustic 	 ians 	 	have	had	to	 re 	 ally 	 	think	about	the	 type 	 s 	 	of	 hall 	 s 	 	they	put	together	.	there	are	so	few	 hall 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	world	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 acoustic 	 s 	 	,	 da 	 re 	 	i	say	.	but	by	that	i	mean	where	you	can	 absolute 	 ly 	 	do	 any 	 thing 	 	you	imagine	.
the	 tin 	 iest 	 	,	 soft 	 est 	 	,	 soft 	 est 	 	sound	to	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	so	broad	,	so	huge	,	so	 in 	 credible 	 	!	there	's	 al 	 ways 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	--	it	may	sound	good	up	there	,	may	not	be	so	good	there	.
may	be	great	there	,	but	 terr 	 ible 	 	up	there	.
 may 	 be 	 	 terr 	 ible 	 	over	there	,	but	not	too	bad	there	,	etc	.	,	etc	.
so	to	find	an	actual	hall	is	 in 	 credible 	 	--	for	which	you	can	play	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	you	imagine	,	 with 	 out 	 	it	 be 	 ing 	 	 cosmetic 	 ally 	 	 enhance 	 d 	 	.
and	so	 there 	 fore 	 	,	 acoustic 	 ians 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	in	conversation	with	people	who	are	 hear 	 ing 	 	 impair 	 ed 	 	,	and	who	are	 particip 	 ators 	 	of	sound	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 quit 	 e 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
i	can	not	,	you	know	,	give	you	any	detail	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	what	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	with	 t 	 hose 	 	 hall 	 s 	 	,	but	it	's	just	the	fact	that	they	are	going	to	a	group	of	people	for	whom	so	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	well	,	how	on	earth	can	they	experience	music	?	you	know	,	they	're	deaf	.	``
we	just	--	we	go	like	that	,	and	we	imagine	that	that	's	what	 deaf 	 ness 	 	is	about	.
or	we	go	like	that	,	and	we	imagine	that	's	what	 blind 	 ness 	 	is	about	.
if	we	see	 some 	 one 	 	in	a	wheelchair	,	we	 assum 	 e 	 	they	can	not	walk	.
it	may	be	that	they	can	walk	three	,	four	,	five	 step 	 s 	 	.	that	,	to	them	,	 mean 	 s 	 	they	can	walk	.
in	a	year	's	time	,	it	could	be	two	extra	 step 	 s 	 	.
in	 an 	 other 	 	year	's	time	,	three	extra	 step 	 s 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	are	 huge 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	to	think	about	.
so	when	we	do	listen	to	each	other	,	it	's	 un 	 believ 	 ably 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	for	us	to	 re 	 ally 	 	test	our	 listen 	 ing 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	,
to	 re 	 ally 	 	use	our	bodies	 a 	 s 	 	a	 reson 	 ating 	 	chamber	,	to	stop	the	judgment	.
for	me	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 music 	 ian 	 	who	 deal 	 s 	 	with	99	percent	of	new	music	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	for	me	to	say	,	``	oh	 y 	 es 	 	,	i	like	that	piece	.
oh	no	,	i	do	n't	like	that	piece	.	``	and	so	on	.
and	you	know	,	i	just	find	that	i	have	to	give	 t 	 hose 	 	 piece 	 s 	 	of	music	real	time	.
it	may	be	that	the	 chemist 	 ry 	 	is	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	right	between	 my 	 self 	 	and	that	 part 	 icular 	 	piece	of	music	,
but	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	i	have	the	right	to	say	it	's	a	bad	piece	of	music	.
and	you	know	,	it	's	just	one	of	the	great	 thing 	 s 	 	about	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 music 	 ian 	 	,	is	that	it	is	so	 un 	 believ 	 ably 	 	fluid	.
so	there	are	no	 rule 	 s 	 	,	no	right	,	no	wrong	,	 th 	 is 	 	way	,	that	way	.
if	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	you	to	clap	--	 may 	 be 	 	i	can	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
if	i	can	just	say	,	``	 pleas 	 e 	 	clap	and	create	the	sound	of	thunder	.	``
i	'm	 assum 	 ing 	 	we	've	all	 experience 	 d 	 	thunder	.
now	,	i	do	n't	mean	just	the	sound	;	i	mean	 re 	 ally 	 	listen	to	that	thunder	 with 	 in 	 	 your 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
and	 pleas 	 e 	 	try	to	create	that	through	your	 clap 	 ping 	 	.	try	.	just	--	 pleas 	 e 	 	try	.
 ver 	 y 	 	good	!	snow	.	snow	.	have	you	ever	heard	snow	?
audience	:	no	.
evelyn	glennie	:	well	then	,	stop	 clap 	 ping 	 	.	try	 aga 	 in 	 	.
try	 aga 	 in 	 	.	snow	.
see	,	you	're	awake	.
rain	.	not	bad	.	not	bad	.
you	know	,	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	here	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	is	that	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	a	group	of	 kid 	 s 	 	not	so	long	ago	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	question	.
now	--	great	 imagin 	 ation 	 	,	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	not	one	of	you	got	out	of	your	 seat 	 s 	 	to	think	,	``	right	!	how	can	i	clap	?	ok	,	 may 	 be 	 	...
 may 	 be 	 	i	can	use	my	 jewel 	 ry 	 	to	create	extra	 sound 	 s 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	i	can	use	the	other	 part 	 s 	 	of	my	body	to	create	extra	 sound 	 s 	 	.	``
not	a	single	one	of	you	thought	about	 clap 	 ping 	 	in	a	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	different	way	other	than	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	your	 seat 	 s 	 	there	and	using	two	 hand 	 s 	 	.
in	the	same	way	that	when	we	listen	to	music	,	we	 assum 	 e 	 	that	it	's	all	 be 	 ing 	 	fed	through	here	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	how	we	experience	music	.	of	course	it	's	not	.
we	experience	thunder	--	thunder	,	thunder	.	think	,	think	,	think	.
listen	,	listen	,	listen	.	now	--	what	can	we	do	with	thunder	?
i	remember	my	teacher	.	when	i	first	 start 	 ed 	 	,	my	 ver 	 y 	 	first	 less 	 on 	 	,	i	was	all	prepared	with	 stick 	 s 	 	,	ready	to	go	.
and	 in 	 stead 	 	of	him	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	ok	,	evelyn	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	,	feet	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 a 	 part 	 	,	 arm 	 s 	 	at	a	more	-	or	-	less	90	degree	angle	,	 stick 	 s 	 	in	a	more	-	or	-	less	v	shape	,	keep	 th 	 is 	 	amount	of	space	here	,	etc	.
 pleas 	 e 	 	keep	your	back	straight	,	etc	.	,	etc	.	,	 etc 	 . 	 	``	--
where	i	was	 prob 	 ably 	 	just	going	to	end	up	 absolute 	 ly 	 	rigid	,	 froze 	 n 	 	,	and	i	would	not	be	able	to	strike	the	drum	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	of	so	 man 	 y 	 	other	 thing 	 s 	 	--	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	evelyn	,	take	 th 	 is 	 	drum	away	for	seven	 day 	 s 	 	,	and	i	'll	see	you	next	week	.	``
so	,	 heaven 	 s 	 	!	what	was	i	to	do	?	i	no	 long 	 er 	 	 requir 	 ed 	 	the	 stick 	 s 	 	;	i	was	n't	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	have	these	 stick 	 s 	 	.
i	had	to	 bas 	 ically 	 	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	drum	,	see	how	it	was	made	,	what	these	little	lugs	did	,	what	the	 snare 	 s 	 	did	.
 turn 	 ed 	 	it	 up 	 side 	 	down	,	 experiment 	 ed 	 	with	the	shell	,	 experiment 	 ed 	 	with	the	head	.
 experiment 	 ed 	 	with	my	body	,	 experiment 	 ed 	 	with	 jewel 	 ry 	 	,	 experiment 	 ed 	 	with	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	of	course	,	i	 return 	 ed 	 	with	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 bruis 	 es 	 	and	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	--	but	 never 	 the 	 less 	 	,	it	was	 s 	 uch 	 	an	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	experience	,	 be 	 cause 	 	then	,	where	on	earth	are	you	going	to	experience	that	in	a	piece	of	music	?
where	on	earth	are	you	going	to	experience	that	in	a	 stud 	 y 	 	book	?
so	we	never	,	ever	 deal 	 t 	 	with	actual	 stud 	 y 	 	 book 	 s 	 	.
so	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	learn	when	we	are	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 percuss 	 ion 	 	player	,	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	a	 music 	 ian 	 	,	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	 straight 	 forward 	 	single	stroke	 roll 	 s 	 	.	like	that	.	and	then	we	get	a	little	 fast 	 er 	 	and	a	little	 fast 	 er 	 	and	a	little	 fast 	 er 	 	.
and	so	on	and	so	forth	.	what	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	piece	 requir 	 e 	 	?
single	stroke	 roll 	 s 	 	.	so	why	ca	n't	i	then	do	that	whilst	 learn 	 ing 	 	a	piece	of	music	?
and	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	he	did	.
and	 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	the	 old 	 er 	 	i	 be 	 came 	 	,	and	when	i	 be 	 came 	 	a	full	-	time	student	at	a	so	 call 	 ed 	 	``	music	institution	,	``	all	of	that	went	out	of	the	window	.
we	had	to	 stud 	 y 	 	from	 stud 	 y 	 	 book 	 s 	 	.
and	 constant 	 ly 	 	,	the	question	,	``	well	,	why	?	why	?	what	is	 th 	 is 	 	 relat 	 ing 	 	to	?
i	need	to	play	a	piece	of	music	.	``	``	oh	,	well	,	 th 	 is 	 	will	help	your	control	!	``
``	well	,	how	?	why	do	i	need	to	learn	that	?	i	need	to	 re 	 late 	 	it	to	a	piece	of	music	.
you	know	.	i	need	to	say	 some 	 thing 	 	.
``	why	am	i	 p 	 rac 	 tic 	 ing 	 	 para 	 didd 	 les 	 	?

i	need	to	have	the	reason	,	and	the	reason	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	by	 say 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	through	the	music	.	``
and	by	 say 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	through	music	,	which	 bas 	 ically 	 	is	sound	,	we	then	can	reach	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	to	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	people	.
but	i	do	n't	want	to	take	 respons 	 ibility 	 	of	your	 emotion 	 al 	 	 bag 	 g 	 age 	 	.
that	's	up	to	you	,	when	you	walk	through	a	hall	.
 be 	 cause 	 	that	then	 determine 	 s 	 	what	and	how	we	listen	to	certain	 thing 	 s 	 	.
i	may	feel	 sorrow 	 ful 	 	,	or	happy	,	or	 exhila 	 rated 	 	,	or	 ang 	 ry 	 	when	i	play	certain	 piece 	 s 	 	of	music	,	but	i	'm	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	 want 	 ing 	 	you	to	feel	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	thing	.
so	 pleas 	 e 	 	,	the	next	time	you	go	to	a	concert	,	just	allow	your	body	to	open	up	,	allow	your	body	to	be	 th 	 is 	 	 reson 	 ating 	 	chamber	.
be	aware	that	you	're	not	going	to	experience	the	same	thing	 a 	 s 	 	the	 perform 	 er 	 	is	.
the	 perform 	 er 	 	is	in	the	worst	possible	position	for	the	actual	sound	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 hear 	 ing 	 	the	contact	of	the	stick	on	the	drum	,	or	the	 malle 	 t 	 	on	the	bit	of	wood	,	or	the	bow	on	the	string	,	etc	.	,
or	the	breath	that	's	creating	the	sound	from	wind	and	 bra 	 s 	 s 	 	.	they	're	 ex 	 peri 	 encing 	 	that	 raw 	 ness 	 	there	.
but	yet	they	're	 ex 	 peri 	 encing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	so	 un 	 believ 	 ably 	 	 pur 	 e 	 	,	which	is	before	the	sound	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
 pleas 	 e 	 	take	note	of	the	life	of	the	sound	after	the	actual	 initi 	 al 	 	strike	,	or	breath	,	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 pull 	 ed 	 	.	just	experience	the	whole	journey	of	that	sound	in	the	same	way	that	i	 wish 	 ed 	 	i	'd	 experience 	 d 	 	the	whole	journey	of	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	just	 arriv 	 ing 	 	last	night	.
