i	've	got	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	18	 minute 	 s 	 	to	 con 	 vince 	 	you	that	 histo 	 ry 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	direction	,	an	arrow	;
that	in	some	fundamental	sense	,	it	's	good	;	that	the	arrow	 point 	 s 	 	to	 some 	 thing 	 	positive	.
now	,	when	the	ted	people	first	 approach 	 ed 	 	me	about	giving	 th 	 is 	 	 up 	 beat 	 	talk	--	--	that	was	before	the	cartoon	of	muhammad	had	 trigger 	 ed 	 	global	 riot 	 ing 	 	.
it	was	before	the	 av 	 ian 	 	flu	had	 reach 	 ed 	 	europe	.
it	was	before	hamas	had	won	the	palestinian	election	,	eliciting	 vari 	 ous 	 	counter	-	 measure 	 s 	 	by	israel	.
and	to	be	honest	,	if	i	had	known	when	i	was	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	give	 th 	 is 	 	 up 	 beat 	 	talk	that	even	 a 	 s 	 	i	was	giving	the	 up 	 beat 	 	talk	,	the	 apocalyp 	 s 	 e 	 	would	be	 un 	 fold 	 ing 	 	--	--	i	might	have	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	is	it	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	if	i	talk	about	 some 	 thing 	 	else	?	``	but	i	did	n't	,	ok	.	so	we	're	here	.	i	'll	do	what	i	can	.	i	'll	do	what	i	can	.
i	've	got	to	 war 	 n 	 	you	:	the	sense	in	which	my	 world 	 view 	 	is	 up 	 beat 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	kind	of	subtle	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	even	elusive	.
the	sense	in	which	i	can	be	 up 	 lift 	 ing 	 	and	inspiring	--	i	mean	,	there	's	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	kind	of	a	certain	grim	dimension	to	the	way	i	try	to	 up 	 lift 	 	,	so	if	grim	inspiration	--	--	if	grim	inspiration	is	not	a	 contradict 	 ion 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	,	that	is	,	i	'm	 af 	 raid 	 	,	the	most	you	can	hope	for	.	ok	,	 to 	 day 	 	--	that	's	if	i	succeed	.
i	'll	see	what	i	can	do	.	ok	?
now	,	in	one	sense	,	the	claim	that	 histo 	 ry 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	direction	is	not	that	controversial	.
if	you	're	just	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	social	structure	,	ok	,	 clear 	 ly 	 	that	's	gotten	more	complex	a	little	over	the	last	10,000	 year 	 s 	 	--	 ha 	 s 	 	 reach 	 ed 	 	 high 	 er 	 	and	 high 	 er 	 	 level 	 s 	 	.
and	in	fact	,	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 sustain 	 ing 	 	a	long	-	 stand 	 ing 	 	trend	that	 pre 	 date 	 s 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	ok	,	that	 bio 	 logical 	 	evolution	was	 do 	 ing 	 	for	us	.
 be 	 cause 	 	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	encases	 it 	 self 	 	in	a	cell	,	then	 cell 	 s 	 	start	 hang 	 ing 	 	out	together	in	 socie 	 ties 	 	.
 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	they	get	so	close	,	they	form	 multi 	 cellular 	 	 organism 	 s 	 	,	then	you	get	complex	 multi 	 cellular 	 	 organism 	 s 	 	;	they	form	 socie 	 ties 	 	.
but	then	at	some	point	,	one	of	these	 multi 	 cellular 	 	 organism 	 s 	 	 do 	 es 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	,	which	is	it	 launch 	 es 	 	a	whole	second	kind	of	evolution	:	cultural	evolution	.
and	 amaz 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	that	evolution	sustains	the	 tra 	 ject 	 ory 	 	that	 bio 	 logical 	 	evolution	had	 establish 	 ed 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	 great 	 er 	 	 complex 	 ity 	 	.
by	cultural	evolution	we	mean	the	evolution	of	 idea 	 s 	 	.
a	lot	of	you	have	heard	the	term	``	 meme 	 s 	 	.	``	the	evolution	of	technology	,	i	pay	a	lot	of	attention	to	,	so	,	you	know	,	one	of	the	first	 thing 	 s 	 	you	got	was	a	little	hand	axe	.
 generation 	 s 	 	go	by	,	 some 	 body 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	 he 	 y 	 	,	why	do	n't	we	put	it	on	a	stick	?
just	 absolute 	 ly 	 	delights	the	little	 one 	 s 	 	.
next	best	thing	to	a	video	game	.
 th 	 is 	 	may	not	seem	to	impress	,	but	 techno 	 logical 	 	evolution	is	 progress 	 ive 	 	,	so	 an 	 other 	 	10	,	20,000	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	armaments	technology	 take 	 s 	 	you	here	.
 impress 	 ive 	 	.	and	the	rate	of	 techno 	 logical 	 	evolution	 speed 	 s 	 	up	,	so	a	mere	quarter	of	a	century	after	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	get	 th 	 is 	 	,	ok	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	'm	sorry	--	it	was	a	cheap	laugh	,	but	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	find	a	way	to	 transit 	 ion 	 	back	to	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	the	 un 	 fold 	 ing 	 	 apocalyp 	 s 	 e 	 	,	and	i	thought	that	might	do	it	.
so	,	what	 threaten 	 s 	 	to	happen	with	 th 	 is 	 	 un 	 fold 	 ing 	 	 apocalyp 	 s 	 e 	 	is	the	collapse	of	global	social	 organ 	 ization 	 	.
now	,	first	let	me	 re 	 mind 	 	you	how	much	work	it	took	to	get	us	where	we	are	,	to	be	on	the	 br 	 ink 	 	of	true	global	social	 organ 	 ization 	 	.
 original 	 ly 	 	,	you	had	the	most	complex	 socie 	 ties 	 	,	the	hunter	-	gatherer	village	.
stonehenge	is	the	remnant	of	a	chiefdom	,	which	is	what	you	get	with	the	 invent 	 ion 	 	of	 agricultur 	 e 	 	:	multi	-	village	polity	with	 central 	 ized 	 	rule	.
with	the	 invent 	 ion 	 	of	writing	,	you	start	 get 	 ting 	 	cities	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 blur 	 ry 	 	.	i	kind	of	like	that	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 make 	 s 	 	it	look	like	a	one	-	celled	organism	and	 re 	 mind 	 s 	 	you	how	 man 	 y 	 	 level 	 s 	 	 organ 	 ic 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	 move 	 d 	 	through	to	get	to	 th 	 is 	 	point	.	and	then	you	get	to	,	you	know	,	you	get	 empire 	 s 	 	.
i	want	to	stress	,	you	know	,	social	 organ 	 ization 	 	can	transcend	 politic 	 al 	 	 bound 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	silk	road	 connect 	 ing 	 	the	chinese	empire	and	the	roman	empire	.
so	you	had	social	 complex 	 ity 	 	 span 	 ning 	 	the	whole	continent	,	even	if	no	polity	did	 similar 	 ly 	 	.	 to 	 day 	 	,	you	've	got	nation	 state 	 s 	 	.
point	is	:	there	's	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 collabor 	 ation 	 	and	 organ 	 ization 	 	going	on	beyond	national	 bound 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	just	a	picture	of	the	earth	at	night	,	and	i	'm	just	 put 	 ting 	 	it	up	 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	.
 do 	 es 	 	kind	of	convey	the	sense	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 integrate 	 d 	 	system	.
now	,	i	 explain 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	growth	of	 complex 	 ity 	 	by	 re 	 ference 	 	to	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	``	non	-	zero	sumness	.	``	 assum 	 ing 	 	that	a	few	of	you	did	not	do	the	 assign 	 ed 	 	 read 	 ing 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	the	key	idea	is	the	 distinct 	 ion 	 	between	zero	-	sum	 game 	 s 	 	,	in	which	 correlation 	 s 	 	are	 in 	 verse 	 	:	 al 	 ways 	 	a	winner	and	a	 lose 	 r 	 	.
non	-	zero	-	sum	 game 	 s 	 	in	which	 correlation 	 s 	 	can	be	positive	,	ok	.	so	like	in	tennis	,	 usual 	 ly 	 	it	's	win	-	lose	;	it	 al 	 ways 	 	 add 	 s 	 	up	to	zero	-	zero	-	sum	.	but	if	you	're	 play 	 ing 	 	 double 	 s 	 	,	the	person	on	your	side	of	the	net	,	they	're	in	the	same	boat	 a 	 s 	 	you	,	so	you	're	 play 	 ing 	 	a	non	-	zero	-	sum	game	with	them	.
it	's	either	for	the	better	or	for	the	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	ok	.	a	lot	of	 form 	 s 	 	of	non	-	zero	-	sum	behavior	in	the	realm	of	 economic 	 s 	 	and	so	on	in	 every 	 day 	 	life	often	 lead 	 s 	 	to	 co 	 operation 	 	.
the	argument	i	make	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	that	,	well	,	non	-	zero	-	sum	 game 	 s 	 	have	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	part	of	life	.
you	have	them	in	hunter	-	gatherer	 socie 	 ties 	 	,	but	then	through	 techno 	 logical 	 	evolution	,	new	 form 	 s 	 	of	technology	arise	that	facilitate	or	 encourag 	 e 	 	the	 play 	 ing 	 	of	non	-	zero	-	sum	 game 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 vol 	 v 	 ing 	 	more	people	over	 large 	 r 	 	 territ 	 ory 	 	.
social	structure	 adapt 	 s 	 	to	 accommo 	 date 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 possibil 	 ity 	 	and	to	harness	 th 	 is 	 	productive	potential	,	so	you	get	cities	,	you	know	,	and	you	get	all	the	non	-	zero	-	sum	 game 	 s 	 	you	do	n't	think	about	that	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 play 	 ed 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	world	.
like	,	have	you	ever	thought	when	you	buy	a	car	,	how	 man 	 y 	 	people	on	how	 man 	 y 	 	different	 continent 	 s 	 	 con 	 tribute 	 d 	 	to	the	 manufactur 	 e 	 	of	that	car	?	 t 	 hose 	 	are	people	in	effect	you	're	 play 	 ing 	 	a	non	-	zero	-	sum	game	with	.
i	mean	,	there	are	 certain 	 ly 	 	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	them	around	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	 sound 	 s 	 	like	an	 intrinsic 	 ally 	 	 up 	 beat 	 	 world 	 view 	 	in	a	way	,	 be 	 cause 	 	when	you	think	of	non	-	zero	,	you	think	win	-	win	,	you	know	,	that	's	good	.	well	,	there	are	a	few	 reason 	 s 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	it	's	not	 intrinsic 	 ally 	 	 up 	 beat 	 	.
first	of	all	,	it	can	 accommo 	 date 	 	;	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 den 	 y 	 	the	 exist 	 ence 	 	of	 ine 	 quality 	 	 exploit 	 ation 	 	war	.
but	there	's	a	more	fundamental	reason	that	it	's	not	 intrinsic 	 ally 	 	 up 	 beat 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	a	non	-	zero	-	sum	game	,	all	it	 tell 	 s 	 	you	for	 s 	 ure 	 	is	that	the	 fortune 	 s 	 	will	be	 correlate 	 d 	 	for	better	or	 wo 	 rse 	 	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 necess 	 arily 	 	predict	a	win	-	win	 out 	 come 	 	.
so	,	in	a	way	,	the	question	is	:	on	what	 ground 	 s 	 	am	i	 up 	 beat 	 	at	all	about	 histo 	 ry 	 	?	and	the	answer	is	,	first	of	all	,	on	balance	i	would	say	people	have	 play 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 game 	 s 	 	to	more	win	-	win	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	than	lose	-	lose	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	.	on	balance	,	i	think	 histo 	 ry 	 	is	a	net	positive	in	the	non	-	zero	-	sum	game	 depart 	 ment 	 	.
and	a	 test 	 a 	 ment 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	thing	that	most	 amaze 	 s 	 	me	,	most	 impress 	 es 	 	me	,	and	most	uplifts	me	,	which	is	that	there	is	a	moral	dimension	to	 histo 	 ry 	 	;	there	is	a	moral	arrow	.	we	have	 s 	 een 	 	moral	progress	over	time	.
2,500	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 member 	 s 	 	of	one	greek	city	-	state	 consider 	 ed 	 	 member 	 s 	 	of	 an 	 other 	 	greek	city	-	state	 sub 	 human 	 	and	 treat 	 ed 	 	them	that	way	.	and	then	 th 	 is 	 	moral	revolution	 arriv 	 ed 	 	,	and	they	 decide 	 d 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	no	,	greeks	are	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
it	's	just	the	persians	who	are	n't	fully	human	and	do	n't	deserve	to	be	 treat 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 nice 	 ly 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	was	progress	--	you	know	,	give	them	credit	.	and	now	 to 	 day 	 	,	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	more	progress	.	i	think	--	i	hope	--	most	people	here	would	say	that	all	people	 every 	 where 	 	are	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	deserve	to	be	 treat 	 ed 	 	decently	,	 un 	 less 	 	they	do	 some 	 thing 	 	 horr 	 end 	 ous 	 	,	 regard 	 less 	 	of	race	or	 relig 	 ion 	 	.
and	you	have	to	read	your	ancient	 histo 	 ry 	 	to	 real 	 ize 	 	what	a	revolution	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	,	ok	.	 th 	 is 	 	was	not	a	 pre 	 valent 	 	view	,	few	thousand	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	i	 attribut 	 e 	 	it	to	 th 	 is 	 	non	-	zero	-	sum	dynamic	.
i	think	that	's	the	reason	there	is	 a 	 s 	 	much	 toler 	 ance 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	 national 	 ities 	 	,	 ethnic 	 ities 	 	,	 relig 	 ions 	 	 a 	 s 	 	there	is	 to 	 day 	 	.	if	you	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	,	you	know	,	why	am	i	not	in	favor	of	 bomb 	 ing 	 	japan	,	well	,	i	'm	 on 	 ly 	 	half	-	 jok 	 ing 	 	when	i	say	they	built	my	car	.
we	have	 th 	 is 	 	non	-	zero	-	sum	relationship	,	and	i	think	that	 do 	 es 	 	lead	to	a	kind	of	a	 toler 	 ance 	 	to	the	 ex 	 tent 	 	that	you	 real 	 ize 	 	that	 some 	 one 	 	else	's	 wel 	 fare 	 	is	 positive 	 ly 	 	 correlate 	 d 	 	with	 your 	 s 	 	--
you	're	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	cut	them	a	break	.
i	kind	of	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	kind	of	a	business	-	class	 moral 	 ity 	 	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	i	do	n't	fly	trans	-	atlantic	business	class	often	 en 	 ough 	 	to	know	,	or	any	other	kind	of	business	class	 re 	 ally 	 	,
but	i	 assum 	 e 	 	that	in	business	class	,	you	do	n't	hear	 man 	 y 	 	 express 	 ions 	 	of	,	you	know	,	 big 	 otry 	 	about	racial	 group 	 s 	 	or	ethnic	 group 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	people	who	are	 fly 	 ing 	 	trans	-	atlantic	business	class	are	 do 	 ing 	 	business	with	all	these	people	;	they	're	making	money	off	all	these	people	.	and	i	 re 	 ally 	 	do	think	that	,	in	that	sense	at	 l 	 east 	 	,	 capital 	 ism 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	 construct 	 ive 	 	force	,	and	more	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	a	non	-	zero	-	sumness	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	 construct 	 ive 	 	force	in	 expand 	 ing 	 	people	's	realm	of	moral	 aware 	 ness 	 	.	i	think	the	non	-	zero	-	sum	dynamic	,	which	is	not	 on 	 ly 	 	economic	by	any	 mean 	 s 	 	--	it	's	not	 al 	 ways 	 	commerce	--	but	it	 ha 	 s 	 	driven	us	to	the	 ver 	 ge 	 	of	a	moral	truth	,	which	is	the	fundamental	 e 	 quality 	 	of	 every 	 one 	 	.	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	that	.
 a 	 s 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 move 	 d 	 	global	,	 move 	 d 	 	us	 to 	 ward 	 	a	global	level	of	social	 organ 	 ization 	 	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	driven	us	 to 	 ward 	 	moral	truth	.
i	think	that	's	 wonder 	 ful 	 	.
now	,	back	to	the	 un 	 fold 	 ing 	 	 apocalyp 	 s 	 e 	 	.
and	you	may	wonder	,	ok	,	that	's	all	fine	,	 sound 	 s 	 	great	--	moral	direction	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	--	but	what	about	 th 	 is 	 	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	 c 	 lash 	 	of	 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	?	well	,	first	of	all	,	i	would	 emphas 	 ize 	 	that	it	 fit 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	non	-	zero	-	sum	 frame 	 work 	 	,	ok	.	if	you	look	at	the	relationship	between	the	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	muslim	world	and	western	world	--	two	 term 	 s 	 	i	do	n't	like	,	but	ca	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	avoid	;	in	 s 	 uch 	 	a	short	span	of	time	,	they	're	efficient	if	 noth 	 ing 	 	else	--
it	is	non	-	zero	-	sum	.	and	by	that	i	mean	,	if	people	in	the	muslim	world	get	more	 hate 	 ful 	 	,	more	resentful	,	less	happy	with	 the 	 ir 	 	place	in	the	world	,	it	'll	be	bad	for	the	west	.	if	they	get	more	happy	,	it	'll	be	good	for	the	west	.
so	that	is	a	non	-	zero	-	sum	dynamic	.
and	i	would	say	the	non	-	zero	-	sum	dynamic	is	 on 	 ly 	 	going	to	grow	more	 intens 	 e 	 	over	time	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 techno 	 logical 	 	 trend 	 s 	 	,	but	more	 intens 	 e 	 	in	a	kind	of	negative	way	.
it	's	the	 down 	 side 	 	correlation	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 fortune 	 s 	 	that	will	 be 	 come 	 	more	and	more	possible	.
and	one	reason	is	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 some 	 thing 	 	i	call	the	``	growing	 lethal 	 ity 	 	of	hatred	.	``
more	and	more	,	it	's	possible	for	 grass 	 root 	 s 	 	hatred	 a 	 broad 	 	to	manifest	 it 	 self 	 	in	the	form	of	 organize 	 d 	 	violence	on	american	 s 	 oil 	 	.
and	that	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	new	,	and	i	think	it	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	going	to	get	a	lot	 wo 	 rse 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 trend 	 s 	 	in	information	technology	,	in	 techno 	 logies 	 	that	can	be	used	for	 purpose 	 s 	 	of	 mun 	 ition 	 s 	 	like	 bio 	 technology 	 	and	 nano 	 technology 	 	.
we	may	be	 hear 	 ing 	 	more	about	that	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	i	worry	about	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	,	which	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	dynamic	will	lead	to	a	kind	of	a	 feed 	 back 	 	cycle	that	 put 	 s 	 	us	on	a	 slip 	 per 	 y 	 	 slop 	 e 	 	.
what	i	have	in	mind	is	:	 terror 	 ism 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	here	;	we	overreact	to	it	.
that	,	you	know	,	we	're	not	 sufficient 	 ly 	 	 sur 	 gical 	 	in	our	 retali 	 ation 	 	 lead 	 s 	 	to	more	hatred	 a 	 broad 	 	,	more	 terror 	 ism 	 	.
we	overreact	 be 	 cause 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	human	,	we	feel	like	 retali 	 ating 	 	,	and	it	 get 	 s 	 	 wo 	 rse 	 	and	 wo 	 rse 	 	and	 wo 	 rse 	 	.
you	could	call	 th 	 is 	 	the	positive	 feed 	 back 	 	of	negative	vibes	,	but	i	think	in	 some 	 thing 	 	so	 s 	 pooky 	 	,	we	 re 	 ally 	 	should	n't	have	the	word	positive	there	at	all	,	even	in	a	technical	sense	.
so	let	's	call	it	the	death	spiral	of	negativity	.
i	assure	you	if	it	 happen 	 s 	 	,	at	the	end	,	both	the	west	and	the	muslim	world	will	have	 suffer 	 ed 	 	.
so	,	what	do	we	do	?	well	,	first	of	all	,	we	can	do	a	lot	more	with	 arm 	 s 	 	control	,	the	 inter 	 national 	 	 regulat 	 ion 	 	of	 danger 	 ous 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	.
i	have	a	whole	global	 govern 	 ance 	 	sermon	that	i	will	spare	you	right	now	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	do	n't	think	that	's	going	to	be	 en 	 ough 	 	 any 	 way 	 	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	it	's	essential	.
i	think	we	're	going	to	have	to	have	a	major	round	of	moral	progress	in	the	world	.
i	think	you	're	just	going	to	have	to	see	less	hatred	among	 group 	 s 	 	,	less	 big 	 otry 	 	,	and	,	you	know	,	racial	 group 	 s 	 	,	religious	 group 	 s 	 	,	 what 	 ever 	 	.
i	've	got	to	admit	i	feel	 s 	 il 	 ly 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	that	.
it	 sound 	 s 	 	so	kind	of	pollyannaish	.	i	feel	like	rodney	king	,	you	know	,	 say 	 ing 	 	,	why	ca	n't	we	all	just	get	 a 	 long 	 	?
but	 he 	 y 	 	,	i	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	see	any	 alter 	 native 	 	,	 give 	 n 	 	the	way	i	read	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
there	's	going	to	have	to	be	moral	progress	.
there	's	going	to	have	to	be	a	 less 	 en 	 ing 	 	of	the	amount	of	hatred	in	the	world	,	 give 	 n 	 	how	 danger 	 ous 	 	it	's	 be 	 coming 	 	.
in	my	defense	,	i	'd	say	,	 a 	 s 	 	naive	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	may	sound	,	it	's	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	 ground 	 ed 	 	in	 cynic 	 ism 	 	.
that	is	to	say	--	--	thank	you	,	thank	you	.	that	is	to	say	,	remember	:	my	whole	view	of	 moral 	 ity 	 	is	that	it	 boil 	 s 	 	down	to	self	-	interest	.
it	's	when	people	's	 fortune 	 s 	 	are	 correlate 	 d 	 	.
it	's	when	your	 wel 	 fare 	 	conduces	to	mine	,	that	i	decide	,	oh	 yea 	 h 	 	,	i	'm	all	in	favor	of	your	 wel 	 fare 	 	.	that	's	what	's	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	growth	of	 th 	 is 	 	moral	progress	so	far	,	and	i	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	we	once	 aga 	 in 	 	have	a	correlation	of	 fortune 	 s 	 	,
and	if	people	respond	to	it	 intelligent 	 ly 	 	,	we	will	see	the	 develop 	 ment 	 	of	 toler 	 ance 	 	and	so	on	--	the	 norm 	 s 	 	that	we	need	,	you	know	.
we	will	see	the	further	evolution	of	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	business	-	class	 moral 	 ity 	 	.
so	,	these	two	 thing 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	if	they	get	people	's	attention	and	drive	home	the	positive	correlation	and	people	do	what	's	in	 the 	 ir 	 	self	-	 interest 	 s 	 	,	which	is	further	the	moral	evolution	,	then	they	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	a	 construct 	 ive 	 	effect	.
and	that	's	why	i	lump	growing	 lethal 	 ity 	 	of	hatred	and	death	spiral	of	negativity	under	the	general	rubric	,	 reason 	 s 	 	to	be	 cheer 	 ful 	 	.
 do 	 ing 	 	the	best	i	can	,	ok	.
i	never	 call 	 ed 	 	 my 	 self 	 	mr.	 up 	 lift 	 	.
i	'm	just	 do 	 ing 	 	what	i	can	here	.
now	,	 launch 	 ing 	 	a	moral	revolution	 ha 	 s 	 	got	to	be	hard	,	right	?
i	mean	,	what	do	you	do	?
and	i	think	the	answer	is	a	lot	of	different	people	are	going	to	have	to	do	a	lot	of	different	 thing 	 s 	 	.
we	all	start	where	we	are	.	 s 	 peaking 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	american	who	 ha 	 s 	 	children	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	security	10	,	20	,	30	 year 	 s 	 	down	the	road	i	worry	about	--	what	i	 personal 	 ly 	 	want	to	start	out	 do 	 ing 	 	is	 figur 	 ing 	 	out	why	so	 man 	 y 	 	people	around	the	world	hate	us	,	ok	.
i	think	that	's	a	worthy	research	project	 my 	 self 	 	.
i	 al 	 so 	 	like	it	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	an	 intrinsic 	 ally 	 	kind	of	 moral 	 ly 	 	redeeming	 exercis 	 e 	 	.	 be 	 cause 	 	to	understand	why	 some 	 body 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	culture	 do 	 es 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	--	 some 	 body 	 	you	're	kind	of	 view 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	alien	,	who	's	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	you	consider	strange	in	a	culture	you	consider	strange	--	to	 re 	 ally 	 	understand	why	they	do	the	 thing 	 s 	 	they	do	is	a	 moral 	 ly 	 	redeeming	 accomplish 	 ment 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	've	got	to	 re 	 late 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	experience	to	 your 	 s 	 	.
to	 re 	 ally 	 	understand	it	,	you	've	got	to	say	,	``	oh	,	i	get	it	.
so	when	they	feel	resentful	,	it	's	kind	of	like	the	way	i	feel	resentful	when	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	,	and	for	 some 	 what 	 	the	same	 reason 	 s 	 	.	``	that	's	true	 understand 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	think	that	is	an	expansion	of	your	moral	compass	when	you	manage	to	do	that	.
it	's	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	hard	to	do	when	people	hate	you	,	ok	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	,	in	a	sense	,	want	to	 complete 	 ly 	 	understand	why	people	hate	you	.
i	mean	,	you	want	to	hear	the	reason	,	but	you	do	n't	want	to	be	able	to	 re 	 late 	 	to	it	.
you	do	n't	want	it	to	make	sense	,	right	?
you	do	n't	want	to	say	,	``	well	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	i	can	kind	of	understand	how	a	human	 be 	 ing 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	would	hate	the	country	i	live	in	.	``	that	's	not	a	 pleas 	 ant 	 	thing	,	but	i	think	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	're	going	to	have	to	get	used	to	and	work	on	.	now	,	i	want	to	stress	that	to	understand	,	you	know	--	there	are	people	who	do	n't	like	 th 	 is 	 	whole	business	of	 understand 	 ing 	 	the	 grass 	 root 	 s 	 	,	the	root	 cause 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	;	they	do	n't	want	to	know	why	people	hate	us	.	i	want	to	understand	it	.
the	reason	you	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	why	they	hate	us	,	is	to	get	them	to	quit	 hat 	 ing 	 	us	.	the	idea	when	you	go	through	 th 	 is 	 	moral	 exercis 	 e 	 	of	 re 	 ally 	 	coming	to	appreciate	 the 	 ir 	 	 human 	 ity 	 	and	better	understand	them	,	is	part	of	an	effort	to	get	them	to	appreciate	your	 human 	 ity 	 	in	the	long	run	.
i	think	it	's	the	first	step	 to 	 ward 	 	that	.	that	's	the	long	-	term	goal	.
there	are	people	who	worry	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	in	fact	,	i	,	 my 	 self 	 	,	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	,	was	 den 	 ounce 	 d 	 	on	national	tv	a	couple	of	 night 	 s 	 	ago	 be 	 cause 	 	of	an	op	-	ed	i	'd	written	.
it	was	kind	of	 a 	 long 	 	these	lines	,	and	the	allegation	was	that	i	have	,	quote	,	``	 affect 	 ion 	 	for	 terrorist 	 s 	 	.	``
now	,	the	good	news	is	that	the	person	who	 s 	 aid 	 	it	was	ann	coulter	.
i	mean	,	if	you	've	got	to	have	an	 ene 	 my 	 	,	do	make	it	ann	coulter	.
but	it	's	not	a	crazy	concern	,	ok	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 understand 	 ing 	 	behavior	can	lead	to	a	kind	of	 empath 	 y 	 	,	and	it	can	make	it	a	little	 hard 	 er 	 	to	deliver	tough	love	,	and	so	on	.
but	i	think	we	're	a	lot	 close 	 r 	 	to	erring	on	the	side	of	not	comprehending	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	 clear 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	than	in	comprehending	it	so	 clear 	 ly 	 	that	we	just	ca	n't	,	you	know	,	get	the	 arm 	 y 	 	out	to	kill	 terrorist 	 s 	 	.
so	i	'm	not	 re 	 ally 	 	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	it	.	so	--	--	i	mean	,	we	're	going	to	have	to	work	on	a	lot	of	 front 	 s 	 	,	but	if	we	succeed	--	if	we	succeed	--	then	once	 aga 	 in 	 	,	non	-	zero	-	sumness	and	the	 re 	 cognition 	 	of	non	-	zero	-	sum	 dynamic 	 s 	 	will	have	 force 	 d 	 	us	to	a	 high 	 er 	 	moral	level	.
and	a	kind	of	saving	 high 	 er 	 	moral	level	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	kind	of	 liter 	 ally 	 	 s 	 ave 	 s 	 	the	world	.
if	you	look	at	the	word	``	 salv 	 ation 	 	``	in	the	 b 	 ible 	 	--	the	christian	 us 	 age 	 	that	we	're	familiar	with	--	saving	 soul 	 s 	 	,	that	people	go	to	heaven	--	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 late 	 com 	 er 	 	.
the	original	meaning	of	the	word	``	 salv 	 ation 	 	``	in	the	 b 	 ible 	 	is	about	saving	the	social	system	.
``	yahweh	is	our	savior	``	 mean 	 s 	 	``	he	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	the	nation	of	israel	,	``	which	at	the	time	,	was	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	high	-	level	social	 organ 	 ization 	 	.
now	,	social	 organ 	 ization 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 reach 	 ed 	 	the	global	level	,	and	i	guess	,	if	there	's	good	news	i	can	say	i	'm	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	you	,	it	's	just	that	all	the	 salv 	 ation 	 	of	the	world	 requir 	 es 	 	is	the	intelligent	 pur 	 suit 	 	of	self	-	 interest 	 s 	 	in	a	 discipline 	 d 	 	and	 care 	 ful 	 	way	.
it	's	going	to	be	hard	.	i	say	we	give	it	a	shot	 any 	 way 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	've	just	come	too	far	to	screw	it	up	now	.
 thank 	 s 	 	.
