there	's	a	definition	of	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	which	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	it	's	the	ability	to	use	the	 small 	 est 	 	possible	crisis	for	the	 big 	 gest 	 	possible	effect	.	``
and	i	want	to	talk	about	how	we	ensure	that	 th 	 is 	 	crisis	,	which	is	by	no	 mean 	 s 	 	small	,	 re 	 ally 	 	is	used	to	the	full	.
i	want	to	start	just	by	 say 	 ing 	 	a	bit	about	where	i	'm	coming	from	.

but	what	i	want	to	talk	about	 begin 	 s 	 	when	i	was	at	 th 	 is 	 	city	,	 th 	 is 	 	university	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	student	.
and	then	 a 	 s 	 	now	,	it	was	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	place	of	 ball 	 s 	 	and	punts	,	 beaut 	 iful 	 	people	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	whom	took	to	heart	ronald	reagan	's	comment	that	,	``	even	if	they	say	hard	work	 do 	 es 	 	n't	do	you	any	harm	,	why	risk	it	?	``

and	when	people	are	n't	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	be	 use 	 ful 	 	,	they	soon	think	that	they	're	 use 	 less 	 	.
and	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	that	was	great	for	the	music	business	at	the	time	,	it	was	n't	much	good	for	 any 	 thing 	 	else	.
and	ever	since	then	,	i	've	 wonder 	 ed 	 	why	it	is	that	 capital 	 ism 	 	is	so	 amaz 	 ing 	 ly 	 	efficient	at	some	 thing 	 s 	 	,	but	so	 in 	 efficient 	 	at	 other 	 s 	 	,	why	it	's	so	 innov 	 ative 	 	in	some	ways	and	so	un	-	 innov 	 ative 	 	in	 other 	 s 	 	.
now	,	since	that	time	,	we	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	through	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	boom	,	the	 long 	 est 	 	boom	ever	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	country	.

but	i	'm	not	 say 	 ing 	 	growth	is	wrong	,	but	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 tri 	 king 	 	that	 through 	 out 	 	the	 year 	 s 	 	of	growth	,	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	did	n't	get	better	.

and	it	 be 	 came 	 	ever	 clear 	 er 	 	that	economic	growth	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	 transl 	 ate 	 	 in 	 to 	 	social	growth	or	human	growth	.

we	've	got	to	do	 what 	 ever 	 	we	can	to	help	them	,
but	we	've	 al 	 so 	 	got	to	ask	,	i	think	,	a	more	 pro 	 found 	 	question	of	 whet 	 her 	 	we	use	 th 	 is 	 	crisis	to	jump	forward	to	a	different	kind	of	 eco 	 nomy 	 	that	's	more	 suit 	 ed 	 	to	human	 need 	 s 	 	,	to	a	better	balance	of	 eco 	 nomy 	 	and	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
and	i	think	one	of	the	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	of	 histo 	 ry 	 	is	that	even	the	 deep 	 est 	 	 cri 	 s 	 es 	 	can	be	 moment 	 s 	 	of	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
they	 br 	 ing 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	from	the	 margin 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 main 	 stream 	 	.
they	often	lead	to	the	 accele 	 ration 	 	of	much	-	 need 	 ed 	 	 reform 	 s 	 	.
and	you	saw	that	in	the	'30s	,	when	the	great	 depress 	 ion 	 	 pav 	 ed 	 	the	way	for	bretton	 wood 	 s 	 	,	 wel 	 fare 	 	 state 	 s 	 	and	so	on	.
and	i	think	you	can	see	around	us	now	,	some	of	the	green	 shoot 	 s 	 	of	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	kind	of	 eco 	 nomy 	 	and	 capital 	 ism 	 	which	could	grow	.
you	can	see	it	in	 dai 	 ly 	 	life	.
when	 time 	 s 	 	are	hard	,	people	have	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	for	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	and	right	 a 	 cross 	 	the	world	,	oxford	,	omaha	,	omsk	,	you	can	see	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	explosion	of	urban	 farm 	 ing 	 	,	people	taking	over	land	,	taking	over	 roof 	 s 	 	,	 turn 	 ing 	 	barges	 in 	 to 	 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	 farm 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'm	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	have	60,000	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	in	my	garden	.
a	few	of	these	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	atilla	the	hen	.
and	i	'm	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	part	of	a	 ver 	 y 	 	large	 move 	 ment 	 	,	which	for	some	people	is	about	 surviv 	 al 	 	,	but	is	 al 	 so 	 	about	 value 	 s 	 	,	about	a	different	kind	of	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	which	is	n't	so	much	about	consumption	and	credit	,	but	about	 thing 	 s 	 	which	matter	to	us	.
and	 every 	 where 	 	too	,	you	can	see	a	 pro 	 life 	 ration 	 	of	time	 bank 	 s 	 	and	parallel	 curr 	 encies 	 	,	people	using	smart	 techno 	 logies 	 	to	link	up	all	the	 resource 	 s 	 	 free 	 d 	 	up	by	the	market	--	people	,	 building 	 s 	 	,	land	--	and	 link 	 ing 	 	them	to	 whom 	 ever 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	got	the	most	 compel 	 ling 	 	 need 	 s 	 	.
there	's	a	similar	story	,	i	think	,	for	 government 	 s 	 	.
ronald	reagan	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 s 	 aid 	 	the	two	 funni 	 est 	 	 sentence 	 s 	 	in	the	english	language	are	,	``	i	'm	from	the	government	.	and	i	'm	here	to	help	.	``
but	i	think	last	year	when	 government 	 s 	 	did	step	in	,	people	 we 	 re 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	glad	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	there	,	that	they	did	act	.
but	now	,	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	on	,	 how 	 ever 	 	good	 politic 	 ians 	 	are	at	 swallow 	 ing 	 	 frog 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 pull 	 ing 	 	a	face	,	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 one 	 	once	put	it	,	they	ca	n't	hide	 the 	 ir 	 	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 al 	 ready 	 	clear	how	much	of	the	enormous	amount	of	money	they	put	 in 	 to 	 	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	went	 in 	 to 	 	 fix 	 ing 	 	the	past	,	bailing	out	the	 bank 	 s 	 	,	the	car	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	,	not	 pre 	 par 	 ing 	 	us	for	the	future	.
how	much	of	the	money	is	going	 in 	 to 	 	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	and	 boost 	 ing 	 	consumption	,	not	 in 	 to 	 	solving	the	 re 	 ally 	 	 pro 	 found 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	we	have	to	solve	.
and	 every 	 where 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	people	think	about	the	unprecedented	 sum 	 s 	 	which	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 pent 	 	of	our	money	and	our	children	's	money	,	now	,	in	the	depth	of	 th 	 is 	 	crisis	,	they	're	 ask 	 ing 	 	:	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	,	we	should	be	using	 th 	 is 	 	with	a	 long 	 er 	 	-	term	vision	to	 accele 	 rate 	 	the	shift	to	a	green	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	to	 prep 	 are 	 	for	aging	,	to	deal	with	some	of	the	 in 	 equal 	 ities 	 	which	scar	 count 	 ries 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	and	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	just	giving	the	money	to	the	incumbents	?
 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	,	we	should	be	giving	the	money	to	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	,	to	civil	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	for	people	able	to	create	the	new	,	not	to	the	big	,	well	-	 connect 	 ed 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	,	big	,	 clunk 	 y 	 	government	 program 	 s 	 	.
and	,	after	all	 th 	 is 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	great	chinese	 s 	 age 	 	lao	tzu	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 govern 	 ing 	 	a	great	country	is	like	 cook 	 ing 	 	a	small	fish	.	do	n't	 over 	 do 	 	it	.	``
and	i	think	more	and	more	people	are	 al 	 so 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	:	why	boost	consumption	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	change	what	we	 consum 	 e 	 	?
like	the	mayor	of	s√£o	paulo	who	's	 bann 	 ed 	 	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	 bill 	 board 	 s 	 	,	or	the	 man 	 y 	 	cities	like	san	francisco	 put 	 ting 	 	in	 infra 	 structure 	 s 	 	for	electric	 car 	 s 	 	.
you	can	see	a	bit	of	the	same	thing	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	the	business	world	.
some	,	i	think	some	of	the	 bank 	 ers 	 	who	have	appear	to	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	and	 for 	 gotten 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
but	ask	 your 	 s 	 elves 	 	:	what	will	be	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 sector 	 s 	 	of	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	in	10	,	20	,	30	 year 	 s 	 	time	?	it	wo	n't	be	the	 one 	 s 	 	lining	up	for	 hand 	 out 	 s 	 	,	like	 car 	 s 	 	and	 aero 	 space 	 	and	so	on	.
the	 big 	 gest 	 	sector	,	by	far	,	will	be	health	--	 al 	 ready 	 	18	percent	of	the	american	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	 predict 	 ed 	 	to	grow	to	30	,	even	40	percent	by	mid	-	century	.
elder	care	,	child	care	,	 al 	 ready 	 	much	 big 	 ger 	 	 employ 	 ers 	 	than	 car 	 s 	 	.
education	:	six	,	seven	,	eight	percent	of	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	and	growing	.
 environment 	 al 	 	 service 	 s 	 	,	energy	 service 	 s 	 	,	the	myriad	of	green	 job 	 s 	 	,	they	're	all	 point 	 ing 	 	to	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	kind	of	 eco 	 nomy 	 	which	is	n't	just	about	 product 	 s 	 	,	but	is	using	 distribut 	 ed 	 	 network 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	 found 	 ed 	 	above	all	on	care	,	on	 relationship 	 s 	 	,
on	what	people	do	to	other	people	,	often	one	to	one	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 simpl 	 y 	 	selling	them	a	product	.
and	i	think	that	what	 connect 	 s 	 	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	for	civil	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	for	 government 	 s 	 	and	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	for	business	now	is	,	in	a	way	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	one	,	but	 quit 	 e 	 	a	difficult	one	.
we	know	our	 socie 	 ties 	 	have	to	 radical 	 ly 	 	change	.
we	know	we	ca	n't	go	back	to	where	we	 we 	 re 	 	before	the	crisis	.
but	we	 al 	 so 	 	know	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	through	experiment	that	we	'll	discover	 exact 	 ly 	 	how	to	run	a	low	carbon	city	,	how	to	care	for	a	much	 old 	 er 	 	population	,	how	to	deal	with	drug	 addict 	 ion 	 	and	so	on	.
and	here	's	the	problem	.
in	science	,	we	do	 experiment 	 s 	 	 system 	 at 	 ically 	 	.
our	 socie 	 ties 	 	now	 s 	 pend 	 	two	,	three	,	four	percent	of	gdp	to	invest	 system 	 at 	 ically 	 	in	new	 discover 	 y 	 	,	in	science	,	in	technology	,	to	fuel	the	 pipe 	 line 	 	of	 brilli 	 ant 	 	 invent 	 ions 	 	which	illuminate	 gather 	 ing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	's	not	that	our	 scientist 	 s 	 	are	 necess 	 arily 	 	much	 smart 	 er 	 	than	they	 we 	 re 	 	a	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 may 	 be 	 	they	are	,	but	they	have	a	hell	of	a	lot	more	 back 	 ing 	 	than	they	ever	did	.
and	what	's	 s 	 tri 	 king 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	,	is	that	in	 socie 	 ty 	 	there	's	 al 	 most 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	 compar 	 able 	 	,	no	 compar 	 able 	 	 invest 	 ment 	 	,	no	 system 	 atic 	 	experiment	,	in	the	 thing 	 s 	 	 capital 	 ism 	 	is	n't	 ver 	 y 	 	good	at	,	like	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	or	 empath 	 y 	 	,	or	 relationship 	 s 	 	or	care	.
now	,	i	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	understand	that	 un 	 til 	 	i	met	 th 	 is 	 	guy	who	was	then	an	80	-	year	-	old	,	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	shambolic	man	who	lived	on	tomato	soup	and	thought	 iron 	 ing 	 	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 over 	 rated 	 	.

and	he	 end 	 ed 	 	his	life	selling	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	to	venture	 capital 	 ists 	 	.
he	 believ 	 ed 	 	if	you	see	a	problem	,	you	should	n't	tell	 some 	 one 	 	to	act	,	you	should	act	on	it	 your 	 self 	 	,	and	he	lived	long	 en 	 ough 	 	and	saw	 en 	 ough 	 	of	his	 idea 	 s 	 	first	scorned	and	then	succeed	that	he	 s 	 aid 	 	you	should	 al 	 ways 	 	take	no	 a 	 s 	 	a	question	and	not	 a 	 s 	 	an	answer	.
and	his	life	was	a	 system 	 atic 	 	experiment	to	find	better	social	 answer 	 s 	 	,	not	from	a	 theor 	 y 	 	,	but	from	experiment	,	and	experiment	 in 	 vol 	 v 	 ing 	 	the	people	with	the	best	 intellig 	 ence 	 	on	social	 need 	 s 	 	,	which	 we 	 re 	 	 usual 	 ly 	 	the	people	living	with	 t 	 hose 	 	 need 	 s 	 	.

now	,	what	he	did	did	n't	used	to	have	a	name	,	but	i	think	it	's	 rapid 	 ly 	 	 be 	 coming 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 main 	 stream 	 	.

 other 	 s 	 	are	much	more	 pragmat 	 ic 	 	:	health	 coach 	 es 	 	,	 learn 	 ing 	 	 mentor 	 s 	 	,	job	 club 	 s 	 	.
and	some	are	 quit 	 e 	 	structural	,	like	social	impact	 bond 	 s 	 	where	you	raise	money	to	invest	in	 divert 	 ing 	 	 teenager 	 s 	 	from	crime	or	 help 	 ing 	 	old	people	keep	out	of	hospital	,	and	you	get	paid	back	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	how	 success 	 ful 	 	your	 project 	 s 	 	are	.
now	,	the	idea	that	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	 represent 	 s 	 	,	i	think	,	is	 rapid 	 ly 	 	 be 	 coming 	 	a	common	sense	and	part	of	how	we	respond	to	the	crisis	,	 recogn 	 izing 	 	the	need	to	invest	in	 innov 	 ation 	 	for	social	progress	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 techno 	 logical 	 	progress	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	big	health	 innov 	 ation 	 	 fund 	 s 	 	 launch 	 ed 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	a	public	service	 innov 	 ation 	 	lab	.
 a 	 cross 	 	 north 	 ern 	 	europe	,	 man 	 y 	 	 government 	 s 	 	now	have	 innov 	 ation 	 	 labor 	 ator 	 ies 	 	 with 	 in 	 	them	.
and	just	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	ago	,	 p 	 resident 	 	obama	 launch 	 ed 	 	the	 off 	 ice 	 	of	social	 innov 	 ation 	 	in	the	white	house	.
and	what	people	are	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	ask	is	:	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	we	invest	in	r	and	d	,	two	,	three	,	four	percent	,	of	our	gdp	,	of	our	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	what	if	we	put	,	let	's	say	,	one	percent	of	public	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	social	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	 in 	 to 	 	elder	care	,	new	 kind 	 s 	 	of	education	,	new	ways	of	 help 	 ing 	 	the	 dis 	 able 	 d 	 	?
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	we	'd	 achiev 	 e 	 	similar	 product 	 ivity 	 	 gain 	 s 	 	in	 socie 	 ty 	 	to	 t 	 hose 	 	we	've	had	in	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	and	in	technology	.
and	if	,	a	generation	or	two	ago	,	the	big	 challeng 	 es 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 one 	 s 	 	like	 get 	 ting 	 	a	man	on	the	moon	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	the	 challeng 	 es 	 	we	need	to	set	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	now	are	 one 	 s 	 	like	 elimi 	 nating 	 	child	 mal 	 nutrition 	 	,	 stop 	 ping 	 	 traffic 	 king 	 	,	or	one	,	i	think	 close 	 r 	 	to	home	for	america	or	europe	,	why	do	n't	we	set	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	the	goal	of	 achiev 	 ing 	 	a	billion	extra	 year 	 s 	 	of	life	for	 to 	 day 	 	's	 citizen 	 s 	 	.
now	 t 	 hose 	 	are	all	 goal 	 s 	 	which	could	be	 achiev 	 ed 	 	 with 	 in 	 	a	decade	,	but	 on 	 ly 	 	with	radical	and	 system 	 atic 	 	experiment	,	not	just	with	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	with	 life 	 style 	 s 	 	and	culture	and	 poli 	 cies 	 	and	 institution 	 s 	 	too	.
now	,	i	want	to	end	by	 say 	 ing 	 	a	little	bit	about	what	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	for	 capital 	 ism 	 	.
i	think	what	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	about	,	 th 	 is 	 	whole	 move 	 ment 	 	which	is	growing	from	the	 margin 	 s 	 	,	 remain 	 s 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	small	.
 noth 	 ing 	 	like	the	 resource 	 s 	 	of	a	cern	or	a	darpa	or	an	ibm	or	a	dupont	.
what	it	's	 tell 	 ing 	 	us	is	that	 capital 	 ism 	 	is	going	to	 be 	 come 	 	more	social	.
it	's	 al 	 ready 	 	 immers 	 ed 	 	in	social	 network 	 s 	 	.
it	will	 be 	 come 	 	more	 involve 	 d 	 	in	social	 invest 	 ment 	 	,	and	social	care	and	in	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	where	the	value	 come 	 s 	 	from	what	you	do	with	 other 	 s 	 	,	not	just	from	what	you	sell	to	them	,	and	from	 relationship 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	from	consumption	.
but	 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	too	,	it	 im 	 plies 	 	a	future	where	 socie 	 ty 	 	 learn 	 s 	 	a	few	 trick 	 s 	 	from	 capital 	 ism 	 	about	how	you	embed	the	dna	of	 rest 	 less 	 	 continu 	 al 	 	 innov 	 ation 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	 try 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	out	and	then	growing	and	 scal 	 ing 	 	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	work	.
now	,	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	future	will	be	 quit 	 e 	 	surprising	to	 man 	 y 	 	people	.
in	 re 	 cent 	 	 year 	 s 	 	,	a	lot	of	intelligent	people	thought	that	 capital 	 ism 	 	had	 bas 	 ically 	 	won	.
 histo 	 ry 	 	was	over	and	 socie 	 ty 	 	would	 inevit 	 ably 	 	have	to	take	second	place	to	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
but	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 truck 	 	with	a	parallel	in	how	people	often	talk	about	 capital 	 ism 	 	 to 	 day 	 	and	how	they	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	the	 mon 	 arch 	 y 	 	200	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	just	after	the	french	revolution	and	the	 resto 	 ration 	 	of	the	 mon 	 arch 	 y 	 	in	france	.
then	,	people	 s 	 aid 	 	 mon 	 arch 	 y 	 	 dominate 	 d 	 	 every 	 where 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	 root 	 ed 	 	in	human	nature	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 natural 	 ly 	 	deferential	.	we	 need 	 ed 	 	 hierarch 	 y 	 	.
just	 a 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	the	 enthusiast 	 s 	 	of	 un 	 re 	 s 	 trained 	 	 capital 	 ism 	 	say	it	's	 root 	 ed 	 	in	human	nature	,	 on 	 ly 	 	now	it	's	 individual 	 ism 	 	,	 inquisitive 	 ness 	 	,	and	so	on	.
then	 mon 	 arch 	 y 	 	had	 s 	 een 	 	off	 it 	 s 	 	big	challenger	,	mass	 demo 	 cracy 	 	,	which	was	 s 	 een 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	well	-	intentioned	but	 doom 	 ed 	 	experiment	,
just	 a 	 s 	 	 capital 	 ism 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 een 	 	off	 social 	 ism 	 	.
even	fidel	castro	now	 say 	 s 	 	that	the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	 wo 	 rse 	 	than	 be 	 ing 	 	 exploit 	 ed 	 	by	 multi 	 national 	 	 capital 	 ism 	 	is	not	 be 	 ing 	 	 exploit 	 ed 	 	by	 multi 	 national 	 	 capital 	 ism 	 	.
and	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	then	monarchies	,	palaces	and	forts	 dominate 	 d 	 	every	city	 sky 	 line 	 	and	 look 	 ed 	 	permanent	and	confident	,	 to 	 day 	 	it	's	the	 gleam 	 ing 	 	 tower 	 s 	 	of	the	 bank 	 s 	 	which	dominate	every	big	city	.
i	'm	not	 suggest 	 ing 	 	the	 crowd 	 s 	 	are	about	to	storm	the	 barricad 	 es 	 	and	string	up	every	 invest 	 ment 	 	 bank 	 er 	 	from	the	 near 	 est 	 	 lamp 	 post 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	that	might	be	 quit 	 e 	 	 tempt 	 ing 	 	.
but	i	do	think	we	're	on	the	 ver 	 ge 	 	of	a	period	when	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	the	 mon 	 arch 	 y 	 	and	,	 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	the	 militar 	 y 	 	too	,	the	central	position	of	finance	capital	is	going	to	come	to	an	end	,	and	it	's	going	to	 stead 	 ily 	 	move	to	the	 side 	 s 	 	,	the	 margin 	 s 	 	of	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	 transform 	 ed 	 	from	 be 	 ing 	 	a	master	 in 	 to 	 	a	 serv 	 ant 	 	,	a	 serv 	 ant 	 	to	the	productive	 eco 	 nomy 	 	and	of	human	 need 	 s 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	that	 happen 	 s 	 	,	we	will	remember	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	and	obvious	about	 capital 	 ism 	 	,	which	is	that	,	 un 	 like 	 	what	you	read	in	 economic 	 s 	 	 text 	 book 	 s 	 	,	it	's	not	a	self	-	sufficient	system	.
it	 depend 	 s 	 	on	other	 system 	 s 	 	,	on	 eco 	 logy 	 	,	on	family	,	on	community	,	and	if	these	are	n't	 replenish 	 ed 	 	,	 capital 	 ism 	 	 suffer 	 s 	 	too	.
and	our	human	nature	is	n't	just	 self 	 ish 	 	,	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 com 	 passionate 	 	.
it	's	not	just	competitive	,	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 car 	 ing 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	depth	of	the	crisis	,	i	think	we	are	at	a	moment	of	choice	.
the	crisis	is	 al 	 most 	 	 certain 	 ly 	 	 deepen 	 ing 	 	around	us	.
it	will	be	 wo 	 rse 	 	at	the	end	of	 th 	 is 	 	year	,	 quit 	 e 	 	possibly	 wo 	 rse 	 	in	a	year	's	time	than	it	is	 to 	 day 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	rare	 moment 	 s 	 	when	we	have	to	 choos 	 e 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	we	're	just	pedaling	 fur 	 iously 	 	to	get	back	to	where	we	 we 	 re 	 	a	year	or	two	ago	,	and	a	 ver 	 y 	 	narrow	idea	of	what	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	is	for	,	or	 whet 	 her 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	moment	to	jump	 a 	 head 	 	,	to	 re 	 boot 	 	and	to	do	some	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	 prob 	 ably 	 	should	have	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 any 	 way 	 	.
thank	you	.
