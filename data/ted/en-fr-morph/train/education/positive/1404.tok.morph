 th 	 is 	 	may	sound	strange	,	but	i	'm	a	big	fan	of	the	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	block	.
the	first	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	 block 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 manufactur 	 ed 	 	in	1868	with	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	idea	:	 modul 	 es 	 	made	of	cement	of	a	 fix 	 ed 	 	 measure 	 ment 	 	that	fit	together	.
 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	 block 	 s 	 	 be 	 came 	 	the	most	-	used	construction	unit	in	the	world	.
they	enabled	us	to	to	build	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 large 	 r 	 	than	us	,	 building 	 s 	 	,	 bridge 	 s 	 	,	one	brick	at	a	time	.
 essential 	 ly 	 	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	 block 	 s 	 	had	 be 	 come 	 	the	building	block	of	our	time	.
 al 	 most 	 	a	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	in	1947	,	lego	came	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	was	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 autom 	 atic 	 	 bind 	 ing 	 	brick	.
and	in	a	few	short	 year 	 s 	 	,	lego	 brick 	 s 	 	took	place	in	every	 house 	 hold 	 	.
it	's	 estimate 	 d 	 	that	over	400	billion	 brick 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 produce 	 d 	 	--	or	75	 brick 	 s 	 	for	every	person	on	the	planet	.
you	do	n't	have	to	be	an	engineer	to	make	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 house 	 s 	 	,	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 bridge 	 s 	 	,	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 building 	 s 	 	.
lego	made	it	 access 	 ible 	 	.
lego	 ha 	 s 	 	 essential 	 ly 	 	taken	the	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	block	,	the	building	block	of	the	world	,	and	made	it	 in 	 to 	 	the	building	block	of	our	 imagin 	 ation 	 	.
 mean 	 while 	 	the	exact	same	year	,	at	bell	 lab 	 s 	 	the	next	revolution	was	about	to	be	 announce 	 d 	 	,	the	next	building	block	.
the	transistor	was	a	small	plastic	unit	that	would	take	us	from	a	world	of	static	 brick 	 s 	 	 pil 	 ed 	 	on	top	of	each	other	to	a	world	where	 every 	 thing 	 	was	 inter 	 active 	 	.
like	the	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	block	,	the	transistor	 allow 	 s 	 	you	to	build	much	 large 	 r 	 	,	more	complex	 circuit 	 s 	 	,	one	brick	at	a	time	.
but	there	's	a	main	 differ 	 ence 	 	:	the	transistor	was	 on 	 ly 	 	for	 expert 	 s 	 	.
i	 personal 	 ly 	 	do	n't	accept	 th 	 is 	 	,	that	the	building	block	of	our	time	is	 re 	 serv 	 ed 	 	for	 expert 	 s 	 	,	so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	change	that	.
eight	 year 	 s 	 	ago	when	i	was	at	the	media	lab	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	how	to	put	the	power	of	 engineer 	 s 	 	in	the	 hand 	 s 	 	of	 artist 	 s 	 	and	 design 	 ers 	 	.
a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 develop 	 ing 	 	littlebits	.
let	me	show	you	how	they	work	.
littlebits	are	 electron 	 ic 	 	 modul 	 es 	 	with	each	one	specific	function	.
they	're	pre	-	engineered	to	be	light	,	sound	,	 motor 	 s 	 	and	 sensor 	 s 	 	.
and	the	best	part	about	it	is	they	snap	together	with	 magnet 	 s 	 	.
so	you	ca	n't	put	them	the	wrong	way	.
the	 brick 	 s 	 	are	color	-	 cod 	 ed 	 	.
green	is	 out 	 put 	 	,	blue	is	power	,	pink	is	 in 	 put 	 	and	 o 	 range 	 	is	wire	.
so	all	you	need	to	do	is	snap	a	blue	to	a	green	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	you	can	start	making	 large 	 r 	 	 circuit 	 s 	 	.
you	put	a	blue	to	a	green	,	you	can	make	light	.
you	can	put	a	knob	in	between	and	now	you	've	made	a	little	_UNK_	.
 s 	 witch 	 	out	the	knob	for	a	 puls 	 e 	 	 modul 	 e 	 	,	which	is	here	,	and	now	you	've	made	a	little	_UNK_	.
add	 th 	 is 	 	buzzer	for	some	extra	punch	and	you	've	 create 	 d 	 	a	noise	machine	.
i	'm	going	to	stop	that	.
so	beyond	simple	play	,	littlebits	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	program	,	to	wire	,	to	 s 	 old 	 er 	 	,	littlebits	allow	you	to	program	using	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	intuitive	 gest 	 ures 	 	.
so	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	blink	 fast 	 er 	 	or	 s 	 lower 	 	,	you	would	just	turn	 th 	 is 	 	knob	and	 bas 	 ically 	 	make	it	 puls 	 e 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	or	 s 	 lower 	 	.
the	idea	 be 	 hind 	 	littlebits	is	that	it	's	a	growing	library	.
we	want	to	make	every	single	 interact 	 ion 	 	in	the	world	 in 	 to 	 	a	ready	-	to	-	use	brick	.
 light 	 s 	 	,	 sound 	 s 	 	,	solar	 pan 	 el 	 s 	 	,	 motor 	 s 	 	--	 every 	 thing 	 	should	be	 access 	 ible 	 	.
we	've	 be 	 en 	 	giving	littlebits	to	 kid 	 s 	 	and	 see 	 ing 	 	them	play	with	them	.
and	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	an	 in 	 credible 	 	experience	.
the	 nic 	 est 	 	thing	is	how	they	start	to	understand	the	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	around	them	from	 every 	 day 	 	that	they	do	n't	learn	at	 school 	 s 	 	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	how	a	_UNK_	 work 	 s 	 	,	or	why	an	 elev 	 ator 	 	door	 stay 	 s 	 	open	,	or	how	an	ipod	 respond 	 s 	 	to	touch	.
we	've	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 en 	 	taking	littlebits	to	design	 school 	 s 	 	.
so	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	we	've	had	 design 	 ers 	 	with	no	experience	with	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	start	to	play	with	littlebits	 a 	 s 	 	a	material	.
here	you	see	,	with	felt	and	paper	water	 bottle 	 s 	 	,	we	have	_UNK_	making	...	a	few	 week 	 s 	 	ago	we	took	littlebits	to	risd	and	 g 	 ave 	 	them	to	some	 design 	 ers 	 	with	no	experience	in	 engineer 	 ing 	 	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	--	just	 card 	 board 	 	,	wood	and	paper	--	and	told	them	``	make	 some 	 thing 	 	.	``	here	's	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	a	project	they	made	,	a	motion	-	 activate 	 d 	 	_UNK_	 can 	 on 	 	ball	.
but	wait	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	project	.
it	's	a	 lob 	 ster 	 	made	of	_UNK_	that	's	 af 	 raid 	 	of	the	dark	.
to	these	non	-	 engineer 	 s 	 	,	littlebits	 be 	 came 	 	 an 	 other 	 	material	,	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	 be 	 came 	 	just	 an 	 other 	 	material	.
and	we	want	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	material	 access 	 ible 	 	to	 every 	 one 	 	.
so	littlebits	is	open	-	source	.
you	can	go	on	the	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	download	all	the	design	 file 	 s 	 	,	make	them	 your 	 self 	 	.
we	want	to	 encourag 	 e 	 	a	world	of	 creator 	 s 	 	,	of	 inventor 	 s 	 	,	of	 contributor 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	world	that	we	live	in	,	 th 	 is 	 	 inter 	 active 	 	world	,	is	 our 	 s 	 	.
so	go	 a 	 head 	 	and	start	 invent 	 ing 	 	.
thank	you	.
