well	 research 	 ers 	 	 s 	 pend 	 	 billion 	 s 	 	of	your	tax	 dollar 	 s 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	that	out	.
they	 s 	 talk 	 	 bli 	 s 	 s 	 ful 	 	 couple 	 s 	 	and	they	 stud 	 y 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	every	move	and	 manner 	 ism 	 	.

for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	in	the	 hap 	 pies 	 t 	 	 marriage 	 s 	 	,	the	wife	is	 th 	 inner 	 	and	better	looking	than	the	husband	.
obvious	,	right	.
it	's	obvious	that	 th 	 is 	 	 lead 	 s 	 	to	marital	 bli 	 s 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	,	women	,	we	care	a	great	deal	about	 be 	 ing 	 	thin	and	good	looking	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	men	 most 	 ly 	 	care	about	 s 	 ex 	 	...
 ideal 	 ly 	 	with	women	who	are	 th 	 inner 	 	and	better	looking	than	they	are	.
the	 beaut 	 y 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	research	 th 	 ough 	 	is	that	no	one	is	 suggest 	 ing 	 	that	women	have	to	be	thin	to	be	happy	;	we	just	have	to	be	 th 	 inner 	 	than	our	 partner 	 s 	 	.
so	 in 	 stead 	 	of	all	that	 labor 	 ious 	 	 diet 	 ing 	 	and	 exercis 	 ing 	 	,	we	just	need	to	wait	for	them	to	get	fat	,	 may 	 be 	 	bake	a	few	pies	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	good	information	to	have	,	and	it	's	not	that	 complic 	 ated 	 	.
research	 al 	 so 	 	 suggest 	 s 	 	that	the	 hap 	 pies 	 t 	 	 couple 	 s 	 	are	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	focus	on	the	 positive 	 s 	 	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	the	happy	wife	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	 point 	 ing 	 	out	her	husband	's	growing	gut	or	 suggest 	 ing 	 	he	go	for	a	run	,	she	might	say	,	``	 w 	 ow 	 	,	honey	,	thank	you	for	going	out	of	your	way	to	make	me	 relat 	 ively 	 	 th 	 inner 	 	.	``	these	are	 couple 	 s 	 	who	can	find	good	in	any	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
``	 yea 	 h 	 	,	it	was	 deva 	 stat 	 ing 	 	when	we	lost	 every 	 thing 	 	in	that	fire	,	but	it	's	kind	of	nice	 sleep 	 ing 	 	out	here	under	the	 star 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	a	good	thing	you	've	got	all	that	body	fat	to	keep	us	warm	.	``	one	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	found	that	the	more	 will 	 ing 	 	a	husband	is	to	do	house	work	,	the	more	 attract 	 ive 	 	his	wife	will	find	him	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	 need 	 ed 	 	a	 stud 	 y 	 	to	tell	us	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	here	's	what	's	going	on	here	.
the	more	 attract 	 ive 	 	she	 find 	 s 	 	him	,	the	more	 s 	 ex 	 	they	have	;	the	more	 s 	 ex 	 	they	have	,	the	 nic 	 er 	 	he	is	to	her	;	the	 nic 	 er 	 	he	is	to	her	,	the	less	she	 nag 	 s 	 	him	about	 leav 	 ing 	 	wet	 to 	 wel 	 s 	 	on	the	bed	--	and	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	they	live	 hap 	 pi 	 ly 	 	ever	after	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	men	,	you	might	want	to	pick	it	up	a	 not 	 ch 	 	in	the	domestic	 depart 	 ment 	 	.
here	's	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	one	.
one	 stud 	 y 	 	found	that	people	who	 s 	 mile 	 	in	 child 	 hood 	 	 photograph 	 s 	 	are	less	 like 	 ly 	 	to	get	a	divorce	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	actual	 stud 	 y 	 	,	and	let	me	 clar 	 ify 	 	.
the	 research 	 ers 	 	 we 	 re 	 	not	looking	at	 document 	 ed 	 	self	-	 report 	 s 	 	of	 child 	 hood 	 	happiness	or	even	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	old	 journal 	 s 	 	.
the	data	 we 	 re 	 	based	 entire 	 ly 	 	on	 whet 	 her 	 	people	 look 	 ed 	 	happy	in	these	early	 picture 	 s 	 	.
now	i	do	n't	know	how	old	all	of	you	are	,	but	when	i	was	a	kid	,	your	 parent 	 s 	 	took	 picture 	 s 	 	with	a	special	kind	of	camera	that	held	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	film	,	and	,	by	god	,	film	was	expensive	.
they	did	n't	take	300	 shot 	 s 	 	of	you	in	that	rapid	-	fire	digital	video	mode	and	then	pick	out	the	 nic 	 est 	 	,	 smiley 	 est 	 	one	for	the	christmas	card	.
oh	no	.
they	 dress 	 ed 	 	you	up	,	they	lined	you	up	,	and	you	 smil 	 ed 	 	for	the	 fuck 	 ing 	 	camera	like	they	told	you	to	or	you	could	kiss	your	 birth 	 day 	 	party	 good 	 bye 	 	.
but	still	,	i	have	a	huge	pile	of	fake	happy	 child 	 hood 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	and	i	'm	glad	they	make	me	less	 like 	 ly 	 	than	some	people	to	get	a	divorce	.
so	what	else	can	you	do	to	 safe 	 guard 	 	your	marriage	?
do	not	win	an	oscar	for	best	actress	.
i	'm	serious	.
bettie	davis	,	joan	crawford	,	hallie	berry	,	hillary	swank	,	sandra	bullock	,	reese	witherspoon	,	all	of	them	single	soon	after	taking	home	that	statue	.
they	 actual 	 ly 	 	call	it	the	oscar	curse	.
it	is	the	marriage	kiss	of	death	and	 some 	 thing 	 	that	should	be	 avoid 	 ed 	 	.
and	it	's	not	just	 success 	 fully 	 	 star 	 ring 	 	in	 film 	 s 	 	that	's	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	 mere 	 ly 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	a	romantic	 come 	 dy 	 	 cause 	 s 	 	relationship	satisfaction	to	plummet	.
 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	,	the	bitter	 real 	 ization 	 	that	 may 	 be 	 	it	could	happen	to	us	,	but	it	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	and	it	 prob 	 ably 	 	never	will	,	 make 	 s 	 	our	 live 	 s 	 	seem	 un 	 bear 	 ably 	 	grim	in	 compar 	 ison 	 	.
and	 theoretic 	 ally 	 	,	i	suppose	if	we	opt	for	a	film	where	 some 	 one 	 	 get 	 s 	 	 brutal 	 ly 	 	 murder 	 ed 	 	or	dies	in	a	 fi 	 ery 	 	car	crash	,	we	are	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	walk	out	of	that	theater	 feel 	 ing 	 	like	we	've	got	it	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	.
 drink 	 ing 	 	alcohol	,	it	 seem 	 s 	 	,	is	bad	for	your	marriage	.
 yea 	 h 	 	.
i	ca	n't	tell	you	 any 	 more 	 	about	that	one	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 stop 	 ped 	 	 read 	 ing 	 	it	at	the	 head 	 line 	 	.
but	here	's	a	 scar 	 y 	 	one	:	divorce	is	 con 	 tag 	 ious 	 	.
that	's	right	--	when	you	have	a	close	couple	friend	split	up	,	it	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	your	 chance 	 s 	 	of	 get 	 ting 	 	a	divorce	by	75	percent	.
now	i	have	to	say	,	i	do	n't	get	 th 	 is 	 	one	at	all	.
my	husband	and	i	have	 watch 	 ed 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	a	few	 friend 	 s 	 	divide	 the 	 ir 	 	 asset 	 s 	 	and	then	struggle	with	 be 	 ing 	 	our	age	and	single	in	an	age	of	 s 	 ex 	 ting 	 	and	viagra	and	eharmony	.
and	i	'm	 think 	 ing 	 	they	've	 d 	 one 	 	more	for	my	marriage	than	a	 life 	 time 	 	of	therapy	ever	could	.
so	now	you	may	be	 wonder 	 ing 	 	,	why	 do 	 es 	 	 any 	 one 	 	get	married	ever	?
well	the	u.s.	federal	government	 count 	 s 	 	more	than	a	thousand	legal	 benefit 	 s 	 	to	 be 	 ing 	 	 some 	 one 	 	's	spouse	--	a	list	that	 include 	 s 	 	 visit 	 ation 	 	 right 	 s 	 	in	jail	,	but	 hope 	 fully 	 	you	'll	never	need	that	one	.
but	beyond	the	 pro 	 found 	 	federal	 perk 	 s 	 	,	married	people	make	more	money	.
we	're	 health 	 ier 	 	,	 physical 	 ly 	 	and	 emotion 	 ally 	 	.
we	produce	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	,	more	 s 	 table 	 	and	more	 success 	 ful 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	.
we	have	more	 s 	 ex 	 	than	our	 suppose 	 d 	 ly 	 	 s 	 wing 	 ing 	 	single	 friend 	 s 	 	--	 believ 	 e 	 	it	or	not	.
we	even	live	 long 	 er 	 	,	which	is	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	 compel 	 ling 	 	argument	for	 marry 	 ing 	 	 some 	 one 	 	you	like	a	lot	in	the	first	place	.
now	if	you	're	not	 current 	 ly 	 	 ex 	 peri 	 encing 	 	the	joy	of	the	joint	tax	return	,	i	ca	n't	tell	you	how	to	find	a	chore	-	loving	person	of	the	 approximate 	 ly 	 	ideal	 s 	 ize 	 	and	 attract 	 ive 	 ness 	 	who	 prefer 	 s 	 	 horr 	 or 	 	 movie 	 s 	 	and	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	a	lot	of	 friend 	 s 	 	 hover 	 ing 	 	on	the	 br 	 ink 	 	of	divorce	,	but	i	can	 on 	 ly 	 	 encourag 	 e 	 	you	to	try	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 benefit 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	've	 point 	 ed 	 	out	,	are	significant	.
the	bottom	line	is	,	 whet 	 her 	 	you	're	in	it	or	you	're	 search 	 ing 	 	for	it	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	marriage	is	an	institution	worth	 pur 	 suing 	 	and	 protect 	 ing 	 	.
so	i	hope	you	'll	use	the	information	i	've	 give 	 n 	 	you	 to 	 day 	 	to	weigh	your	personal	 strength 	 s 	 	against	your	own	risk	 factor 	 s 	 	.
for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	in	my	marriage	,	i	'd	say	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
one	the	one	hand	,	i	have	a	husband	who	's	 annoy 	 ing 	 ly 	 	lean	and	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 hand 	 some 	 	.
so	i	'm	 obvious 	 ly 	 	going	to	need	 fat 	 ten 	 	him	up	.
and	like	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	we	have	 t 	 hose 	 	 divorce 	 d 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	who	may	 secret 	 ly 	 	or	 sub 	 conscious 	 ly 	 	be	 try 	 ing 	 	to	break	us	up	.
so	we	have	to	keep	an	eye	on	that	.
and	we	do	like	a	 cock 	 tail 	 	or	two	.
on	the	other	hand	,	i	have	the	fake	happy	picture	thing	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	,	my	husband	 do 	 es 	 	a	lot	around	the	house	,	and	would	 hap 	 pi 	 ly 	 	never	see	 an 	 other 	 	romantic	 come 	 dy 	 	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	he	 live 	 s 	 	.
so	i	've	got	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	going	for	me	.
but	just	in	case	,	i	plan	to	work	extra	hard	to	not	win	an	oscar	 any 	 time 	 	soon	.
and	for	the	good	of	your	 relationship 	 s 	 	,	i	would	 encourag 	 e 	 	you	to	do	the	same	.
i	'll	see	you	at	the	bar	.
