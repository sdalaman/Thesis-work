hi	.	i	'm	kevin	allocca	,	i	'm	the	 trend 	 s 	 	 manage 	 r 	 	at	youtube	,	and	i	 professional 	 ly 	 	watch	youtube	 video 	 s 	 	.
it	's	true	.
so	we	're	going	to	talk	a	little	bit	 to 	 day 	 	about	how	 video 	 s 	 	go	viral	and	then	why	that	even	 matter 	 s 	 	.
we	all	want	to	be	 star 	 s 	 	--	 celebr 	 ities 	 	,	 s 	 ing 	 ers 	 	,	 comedian 	 s 	 	--	and	when	i	was	 young 	 er 	 	,	that	 seem 	 ed 	 	so	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	do	.
but	now	web	video	 ha 	 s 	 	made	it	so	that	any	of	us	or	any	of	the	creative	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	do	can	 be 	 come 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	famous	in	a	part	of	our	world	's	culture	.
any	one	of	you	could	be	famous	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	by	next	saturday	.
but	there	are	over	48	 hour 	 s 	 	of	video	 upload 	 ed 	 	to	youtube	every	minute	.
and	of	that	,	 on 	 ly 	 	a	 tin 	 y 	 	 percent 	 age 	 	ever	 go 	 es 	 	viral	and	 get 	 s 	 	 ton 	 s 	 	of	 view 	 s 	 	and	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	cultural	moment	.
so	how	 do 	 es 	 	it	happen	?
three	 thing 	 s 	 	:	tastemakers	,	 commun 	 ities 	 	of	 particip 	 ation 	 	and	unexpectedness	.
all	right	,	let	's	go	.
bear	vasquez	:	oh	,	my	god	.	oh	,	my	god	.
oh	,	my	god	!
wooo	!
_UNK_	,	_UNK_	!
ka	:	last	year	,	bear	vasquez	 post 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	video	that	he	had	shot	 out 	 side 	 	his	home	in	yosemite	national	park	.
in	2010	,	it	was	 view 	 ed 	 	23	million	 time 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	chart	of	what	it	 look 	 ed 	 	like	when	it	first	 be 	 came 	 	popular	last	summer	.
but	he	did	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	set	out	to	make	a	viral	video	,	bear	.
he	just	 want 	 ed 	 	to	share	a	 rain 	 bow 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	what	you	do	when	your	name	is	yosemite	mountain	bear	.
and	he	had	 post 	 ed 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	nature	 video 	 s 	 	in	fact	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	video	had	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 post 	 ed 	 	so	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	here	?
jimmy	kimmel	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
jimmy	kimmel	 post 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	tweet	that	would	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	propel	the	video	to	be	 a 	 s 	 	popular	 a 	 s 	 	it	would	 be 	 come 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	tastemakers	like	jimmy	kimmel	 introduc 	 e 	 	us	to	new	and	 interest 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	and	 br 	 ing 	 	them	to	a	 large 	 r 	 	audience	.
rebecca	black	:	♫	it	's	friday	,	friday	.	got	ta	get	down	on	friday	.	♫	♫	 every 	 body 	 	's	looking	forward	to	the	 week 	 end 	 	,	 week 	 end 	 	.	♫	♫	friday	,	friday	.	 get 	 tin 	 	'	down	on	friday	.	♫	ka	:	so	you	did	n't	think	that	we	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	 th 	 is 	 	conversation	 with 	 out 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	video	i	hope	.
rebecca	black	's	``	friday	``	is	one	of	the	most	popular	 video 	 s 	 	of	the	year	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 een 	 	 near 	 ly 	 	200	million	 time 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	chart	of	what	it	 look 	 ed 	 	like	.
and	similar	to	``	double	 rain 	 bow 	 	,	``	it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	have	just	sprouted	up	out	of	 no 	 where 	 	.
so	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	day	?
well	it	was	a	friday	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	true	.
and	if	you	're	 wonder 	 ing 	 	about	 t 	 hose 	 	other	 spike 	 s 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	are	 al 	 so 	 	fridays	.
but	what	about	 th 	 is 	 	day	,	 th 	 is 	 	one	 part 	 icular 	 	friday	?
well	_UNK_	.	0	 pick 	 ed 	 	it	up	,	a	lot	of	 blog 	 s 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	writing	about	.
michael	j.	nelson	from	 myster 	 y 	 	science	theater	was	one	of	the	first	people	to	post	a	joke	about	the	video	on	twitter	.
but	what	's	 import 	 ant 	 	is	that	an	individual	or	a	group	of	tastemakers	took	a	point	of	view	and	they	 share 	 d 	 	that	with	a	 large 	 r 	 	audience	,	 accele 	 rating 	 	the	process	.
and	so	then	 th 	 is 	 	community	 form 	 ed 	 	of	people	who	 share 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	big	 in 	 side 	 	joke	and	they	 start 	 ed 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	it	and	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	with	it	.
and	now	there	are	10,000	parodies	of	``	friday	``	on	youtube	.
even	in	the	first	seven	 day 	 s 	 	,	there	was	one	 paro 	 dy 	 	for	every	other	day	of	the	week	.
 un 	 like 	 	the	one	-	way	 entertain 	 ment 	 	of	the	20th	century	,	 th 	 is 	 	community	 particip 	 ation 	 	is	how	we	 be 	 come 	 	a	part	of	the	 phenomen 	 on 	 	--	either	by	 spread 	 ing 	 	it	or	by	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	new	with	it	.
so	``	nyan	cat	``	is	a	 loop 	 ed 	 	 anim 	 ation 	 	with	 loop 	 ed 	 	music	.
it	's	 th 	 is 	 	,	just	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 view 	 ed 	 	 near 	 ly 	 	50	million	 time 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	.
and	if	you	think	that	that	is	weird	,	you	should	know	that	there	is	a	three	-	hour	version	of	 th 	 is 	 	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	 view 	 ed 	 	four	million	 time 	 s 	 	.
even	 cat 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	video	.
 cat 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	other	 cat 	 s 	 	watch	 th 	 is 	 	video	.
but	what	's	 import 	 ant 	 	here	is	the	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	that	it	inspired	 among 	 st 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 tech 	 ie 	 	,	 geek 	 y 	 	 inter 	 net 	 	culture	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	 remix 	 es 	 	.
 some 	 one 	 	made	an	old	timey	version	.	and	then	it	went	 inter 	 national 	 	.
an	entire	remix	community	sprouted	up	that	 br 	 ought 	 	it	from	 be 	 ing 	 	just	a	stupid	joke	to	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	can	all	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	a	part	of	.	 be 	 cause 	 	we	do	n't	just	enjoy	now	,	we	 particip 	 ate 	 	.
and	who	could	have	 predict 	 ed 	 	any	of	 th 	 is 	 	?
who	could	have	 predict 	 ed 	 	``	double	 rain 	 bow 	 	``	or	rebecca	black	or	``	nyan	cat	?	``
what	 script 	 s 	 	could	you	have	written	that	would	have	 contain 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	it	?
in	a	world	where	over	two	 day 	 s 	 	of	video	get	 upload 	 ed 	 	every	minute	,	 on 	 ly 	 	that	which	is	 tru 	 ly 	 	 un 	 ique 	 	and	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	can	stand	out	in	the	way	that	these	 thing 	 s 	 	have	.
when	a	friend	of	mine	told	me	that	i	 need 	 ed 	 	to	see	 th 	 is 	 	great	video	about	a	guy	 protest 	 ing 	 	 bi 	 cycle 	 	_UNK_	in	new	york	city	,	i	admit	i	was	n't	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	.
casey	niestat	:	so	i	got	a	ticket	for	not	 rid 	 ing 	 	in	the	bike	lane	,	but	often	there	are	 obstruct 	 ions 	 	that	keep	you	from	 proper 	 ly 	 	 rid 	 ing 	 	in	the	bike	lane	.
ka	:	by	 be 	 ing 	 	 total 	 ly 	 	surprising	and	 humor 	 ous 	 	,	casey	niestat	got	his	funny	idea	and	point	 s 	 een 	 	five	million	 time 	 s 	 	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	approach	 hold 	 s 	 	for	 any 	 thing 	 	new	that	we	do	 creative 	 ly 	 	.
and	so	it	all	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	us	to	one	big	question	...
bear	vasquez	:	what	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	mean	?
_UNK_	.
ka	:	what	 do 	 es 	 	it	mean	?
tastemakers	,	creative	 particip 	 ating 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	,	complete	unexpectedness	,	these	are	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	of	a	new	kind	of	media	and	a	new	kind	of	culture	where	 any 	 one 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	access	and	the	audience	 define 	 s 	 	the	 popular 	 ity 	 	.
i	mean	,	 a 	 s 	 	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	,	one	of	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 star 	 s 	 	in	the	world	right	now	,	justin	bieber	,	got	his	start	on	youtube	.
no	one	 ha 	 s 	 	to	green	-	light	your	idea	.
and	we	all	now	feel	some	 owner 	 ship 	 	in	our	own	pop	culture	.
and	these	are	not	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	of	old	media	,	and	they	're	 bare 	 ly 	 	true	of	the	media	of	 to 	 day 	 	,
but	they	will	define	the	 entertain 	 ment 	 	of	the	future	.
thank	you	.
