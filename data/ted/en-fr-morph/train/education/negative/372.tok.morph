i	 da 	 bble 	 	in	design	.	i	'm	a	 cur 	 ator 	 	of	 architect 	 ure 	 	and	design	;	i	happen	to	be	at	the	museum	of	modern	art	.
but	what	we	're	going	to	talk	about	 to 	 day 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	design	.	 re 	 ally 	 	good	 design 	 ers 	 	are	like	 sponge 	 s 	 	:	they	 re 	 ally 	 	are	 cur 	 ious 	 	and	absorb	every	kind	of	information	that	 come 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	way	,	and	transform	it	so	that	it	can	be	used	by	people	like	us	.
and	so	that	 give 	 s 	 	me	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	every	design	show	that	i	 cur 	 ate 	 	kind	of	 look 	 s 	 	at	a	different	world	.	and	it	's	great	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 seem 	 s 	 	like	every	time	i	change	 job 	 s 	 	.
and	what	i	'm	going	to	do	 to 	 day 	 	is	i	'm	going	to	give	you	a	 pre 	 view 	 	of	the	next	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	that	i	'm	 work 	 ing 	 	on	,	which	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	design	and	the	elastic	mind	.	``
the	world	that	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	focus	on	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	time	is	the	world	of	science	and	the	world	of	technology	.
technology	 al 	 ways 	 	 come 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	play	when	design	is	 involve 	 d 	 	,	but	science	 do 	 es 	 	a	little	less	.
but	 design 	 ers 	 	are	great	at	taking	big	 revolution 	 s 	 	that	happen	and	 transform 	 ing 	 	them	so	that	we	can	use	them	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 th 	 is 	 	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	 look 	 s 	 	at	.
if	you	think	about	your	life	 to 	 day 	 	,	you	go	every	day	through	 man 	 y 	 	different	 scale 	 s 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	different	 change 	 s 	 	of	rhythm	and	pace	.
you	work	over	different	time	 zone 	 s 	 	,	you	talk	to	 ver 	 y 	 	different	people	,
you	 multi 	 task 	 	.	we	all	know	it	,	and	we	do	it	kind	of	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	.
some	of	the	 mind 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	audience	are	super	elastic	,	 other 	 s 	 	are	a	little	 s 	 lower 	 	,	 other 	 s 	 	have	a	few	stretch	 mark 	 s 	 	,	but	 non 	 e 	 the 	 less 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 quit 	 e 	 	 exception 	 al 	 	audience	from	that	 view 	 point 	 	.
other	people	are	not	 a 	 s 	 	elastic	.
i	ca	n't	get	my	father	in	italy	to	work	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	want	to	put	high	-	speed	 inter 	 net 	 	at	home	.
and	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	some	little	bit	of	fear	,	little	bit	of	 resist 	 ance 	 	or	just	 clog 	 ged 	 	 mechan 	 ism 	 s 	 	.
so	 design 	 ers 	 	work	on	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	 mal 	 a 	 ise 	 	that	we	have	,	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 dis 	 comfort 	 s 	 	that	we	have	,	and	try	to	make	life	 eas 	 ier 	 	for	us	.
 elastic 	 ity 	 	of	mind	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	 re 	 ally 	 	need	,	you	know	,	we	 re 	 ally 	 	need	,	we	 re 	 ally 	 	 cher 	 ish 	 	and	we	 re 	 ally 	 	work	on	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	is	about	the	work	of	 design 	 ers 	 	that	help	us	be	more	elastic	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	of	 design 	 ers 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	work	on	 th 	 is 	 	 elastic 	 ity 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.	and	one	last	thing	is	that	it	's	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 design 	 ers 	 	,	but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 scientist 	 s 	 	.
and	before	i	launch	 in 	 to 	 	the	 dis 	 play 	 	of	some	of	the	 slide 	 s 	 	and	 in 	 to 	 	the	 pre 	 view 	 	,	i	would	like	to	point	out	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	detail	about	 scientist 	 s 	 	and	design	.
you	can	say	that	the	relationship	between	science	and	design	 go 	 es 	 	back	centuries	.	you	can	of	course	talk	about	leonardo	da	vinci	and	 man 	 y 	 	other	 ren 	 aiss 	 ance 	 	men	and	women	--	and	there	's	a	 gig 	 antic 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	it	.
but	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	a	 re 	 ally 	 	great	science	historian	you	might	know	,	peter	galison	--	he	 teach 	 es 	 	at	harvard	--	what	 nano 	 technology 	 	in	 part 	 icular 	 	and	 quant 	 um 	 	physics	have	 br 	 ought 	 	to	 design 	 ers 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	 renew 	 ed 	 	interest	,	 th 	 is 	 	real	 pass 	 ion 	 	for	design	.
so	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	the	idea	of	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	build	 thing 	 s 	 	bottom	up	,	atom	by	atom	,	 ha 	 s 	 	made	them	all	 in 	 to 	 	 tinker 	 ers 	 	.
and	all	of	a	sudden	 scientist 	 s 	 	are	seeking	 design 	 ers 	 	,	just	like	 design 	 ers 	 	are	seeking	 scientist 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	brand	-	new	love	 af 	 fair 	 	that	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 cultiv 	 ate 	 	at	moma	.	together	with	adam	bly	,	who	is	the	founder	of	seed	magazine	--	that	's	now	a	 multi 	 media 	 	company	,	you	might	know	it	--	we	 found 	 ed 	 	about	a	year	ago	a	 month 	 ly 	 	 s 	 al 	 on 	 	for	 design 	 ers 	 	and	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
and	keith	 ha 	 s 	 	come	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	jonathan	 ha 	 s 	 	come	and	 man 	 y 	 	 other 	 s 	 	.
and	it	was	great	,	 be 	 cause 	 	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	was	 th 	 is 	 	 apolog 	 y 	 	fest	--	you	know	,	 scientist 	 s 	 	would	tell	 design 	 ers 	 	,	you	know	,	i	do	n't	know	what	style	is	,	i	'm	not	 re 	 ally 	 	elegant	.
and	 design 	 ers 	 	would	like	,	oh	,	i	do	n't	know	how	to	do	an	 equ 	 ation 	 	,	i	do	n't	understand	what	you	're	 say 	 ing 	 	.	and	then	all	of	a	sudden	they	 re 	 ally 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	each	 other 	 s 	 	'	language	,	and	now	we	're	 al 	 ready 	 	at	the	point	that	they	 collabor 	 ate 	 	.
paul	steinhardt	,	a	physicist	from	new	york	,	and	aranda	/	lasch	,	 architect 	 s 	 	,	 collabor 	 ated 	 	in	an	 install 	 ation 	 	in	london	at	the	serpentine	.
and	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	see	how	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	.
the	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	will	talk	about	the	work	of	both	 design 	 ers 	 	and	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	and	show	how	they	're	 present 	 ing 	 	the	 possibil 	 ities 	 	of	the	future	to	us	.
i	'm	 show 	 ing 	 	to	you	different	 section 	 s 	 	of	the	show	right	now	,	just	to	give	you	a	taste	of	it	.
nanophysics	and	 nano 	 technology 	 	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	have	 re 	 ally 	 	 open 	 ed 	 	the	 design 	 er 	 	's	mind	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	i	'm	 show 	 ing 	 	more	the	 design 	 ers 	 	'	work	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	have	 re 	 ally 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 stimul 	 ated 	 	.
a	lot	of	the	 object 	 s 	 	in	the	show	are	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	,	not	 object 	 s 	 	that	exist	 al 	 ready 	 	.	but	what	you	're	looking	at	here	is	the	work	of	some	 scientist 	 s 	 	from	ucla	.
 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 alpha 	 bet 	 	soup	is	a	new	way	to	mark	 protein 	 s 	 	--	not	 on 	 ly 	 	by	color	but	 liter 	 ally 	 	by	 alpha 	 bet 	 	 letter 	 s 	 	.	so	they	construct	it	,	and	they	can	construct	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 form 	 s 	 	at	the	 nano 	 scale 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	work	of	design	 student 	 s 	 	from	the	royal	college	of	 art 	 s 	 	in	london	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	together	with	 the 	 ir 	 	tutor	,	tony	dunne	,	and	with	a	bunch	of	 scientist 	 s 	 	around	great	britain	on	the	 possibil 	 ities 	 	of	 nano 	 technology 	 	for	design	in	the	future	.
new	 sens 	 ing 	 	 element 	 s 	 	on	the	body	--
you	can	grow	 hair 	 s 	 	on	your	 nail 	 s 	 	,	and	 there 	 fore 	 	grab	some	of	the	 particle 	 s 	 	from	 an 	 other 	 	person	.
they	seem	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	 find 	 ing 	 	out	more	about	the	ideal	mate	.
so	they	're	 work 	 ing 	 	on	enhancing	 every 	 thing 	 	:	touch	,	smell	--	 every 	 thing 	 	they	can	,	in	order	to	find	the	perfect	mate	.
 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 type 	 face 	 	 design 	 er 	 	from	israel	who	 ha 	 s 	 	designed	--	he	 call 	 s 	 	them	``	 typo 	 s 	 perma 	 	.	``
he	's	 think 	 ing 	 	--	of	course	it	's	all	a	 con 	 cept 	 	--	of	 inject 	 ing 	 	 type 	 face 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 s 	 perm 	 atozoa 	 	,	i	do	n't	know	how	to	say	it	in	english	--	 s 	 perm 	 atazoi 	 	--	in	order	to	make	them	 be 	 come 	 	--	to	 al 	 most 	 	have	a	song	or	a	whole	poem	written	with	every	 ejacul 	 ation 	 	.
i	tell	you	,	 design 	 ers 	 	are	 quit 	 e 	 	fantastic	,	you	know	.
so	,	tissue	design	.	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	too	,	you	have	a	 mix 	 ture 	 	of	 scientist 	 s 	 	and	 design 	 ers 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	here	is	part	of	the	same	lab	at	the	royal	college	of	 art 	 s 	 	.
the	rca	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	school	from	that	 view 	 point 	 	.
one	of	the	 assign 	 ments 	 	for	a	year	was	to	work	with	in	-	vitro	meat	.
you	know	that	 al 	 ready 	 	you	can	grow	meat	in	vitro	.
in	australia	they	did	it	--	 th 	 is 	 	research	company	,	 call 	 ed 	 	symbiotica	.	but	the	problem	is	that	it	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 ug 	 ly 	 	 pat 	 ty 	 	.
and	so	,	the	 assign 	 ment 	 	to	the	 student 	 s 	 	was	,	how	should	the	steak	of	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	be	?
when	you	do	n't	have	to	kill	 cow 	 s 	 	and	it	can	have	any	shape	,	what	should	it	be	like	?
so	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	student	,	james	king	,	went	around	the	 beaut 	 iful 	 	english	 country 	 side 	 	,	 pick 	 ed 	 	the	best	,	best	cow	that	he	could	see	,	and	then	put	her	in	the	mri	machine	.
then	,	he	took	the	 s 	 can 	 s 	 	of	the	best	 organ 	 s 	 	and	made	the	meat	--
of	course	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 d 	 one 	 	with	a	japanese	 re 	 s 	 in 	 s 	 	food	maker	,	but	you	know	,	in	the	future	it	could	be	made	better	--
which	 re 	 produce 	 s 	 	the	best	mri	 s 	 can 	 	of	the	best	cow	he	could	find	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	element	here	is	much	more	 ban 	 al 	 	.
 some 	 thing 	 	that	you	know	can	be	 d 	 one 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	is	to	grow	bone	tissue	,	so	that	you	can	make	a	 wed 	 d 	 ing 	 	ring	out	of	the	bone	tissue	of	your	 love 	 d 	 	one	--	 liter 	 ally 	 	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	made	of	human	bone	tissue	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	symbiotica	,	and	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	--	they	 we 	 re 	 	the	first	 one 	 s 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	in	-	vitro	meat	--	and	now	they	've	 al 	 so 	 	 d 	 one 	 	an	in	-	vitro	coat	,	a	leather	coat	.
it	's	 mini 	 s 	 cule 	 	,	but	it	's	a	real	coat	.	it	's	shaped	like	one	.
so	,	we	'll	be	able	to	 re 	 ally 	 	not	have	any	excuse	to	be	 wear 	 ing 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	leather	in	the	future	.
one	of	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 top 	 ic 	 s 	 	of	the	show	--	you	know	,	 a 	 s 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	in	our	life	 to 	 day 	 	,	we	can	look	at	it	from	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	different	 view 	 point 	 s 	 	,	and	at	different	 level 	 s 	 	.
one	of	the	most	 interest 	 ing 	 	and	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	is	the	idea	of	scale	.	we	change	scale	 ver 	 y 	 	often	:	we	change	 re 	 solution 	 	of	 screen 	 s 	 	,	and	we	're	not	 re 	 ally 	 	fazed	by	it	,	we	do	it	 ver 	 y 	 	 comfort 	 ably 	 	.
so	you	go	,	even	in	the	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	,	from	the	idea	of	 nano 	 technology 	 	and	the	 nano 	 scale 	 	to	the	 manipul 	 ation 	 	of	 re 	 ally 	 	great	 amount 	 s 	 	of	data	--	the	mapping	and	 tag 	 ging 	 	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	and	of	the	world	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	case	a	section	will	be	 devote 	 d 	 	to	information	design	.
you	see	here	the	work	of	ben	fry	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	``	human	 v 	 s 	 . 	 	 chimp 	 s 	 	``	--	the	few	 chromosom 	 es 	 	that	distinguish	us	from	 chimp 	 s 	 	.
it	was	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 visual 	 ization 	 	that	he	did	for	seed	magazine	.	and	here	's	the	whole	code	of	pac	-	man	,	 visual 	 ized 	 	with	all	the	go	-	to	,	go	-	back	-	to	,	 al 	 so 	 	made	 in 	 to 	 	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 choreograph 	 y 	 	.
and	then	 al 	 so 	 	 graph 	 s 	 	by	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 dia 	 graph 	 	of	protein	 homo 	 logy 	 	.
 scientist 	 s 	 	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	 al 	 so 	 	consider	 aesthetic 	 s 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 discuss 	 ing 	 	with	keith	shrubb	*	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	the	fact	that	 man 	 y 	 	 scientist 	 s 	 	tend	not	to	use	 any 	 thing 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 present 	 ations 	 	,	 other 	 wise 	 	they	're	 af 	 raid 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 consider 	 ed 	 	dumb	 blond 	 es 	 	.
so	they	pick	the	worst	 back 	 ground 	 	from	any	kind	of	powerpoint	 present 	 ation 	 	,	the	worst	 type 	 face 	 	.
it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	marriage	between	design	and	science	is	producing	some	of	the	first	``	 pre 	 tty 	 	``	--	if	we	can	say	so	--	scientific	 present 	 ations 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	 a 	 spect 	 	of	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	design	that	i	think	is	mind	-	 open 	 ing 	 	,	promising	and	will	 re 	 ally 	 	be	the	future	of	design	,	is	the	idea	of	 collect 	 ive 	 	design	.
you	know	,	the	whole	xo	 lap 	 top 	 	,	from	one	 lap 	 top 	 	per	child	,	is	based	on	the	idea	of	 collabor 	 ation 	 	and	mash	and	 network 	 ing 	 	.
so	,	the	more	the	 mer 	 rier 	 	.	the	more	 computer 	 s 	 	,	the	 strong 	 er 	 	the	signal	,	and	children	work	on	the	 inter 	 face 	 	so	that	it	's	all	based	on	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	together	,	 task 	 s 	 	together	.
so	the	idea	of	 collect 	 ive 	 	design	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	will	 be 	 come 	 	even	 big 	 ger 	 	in	the	future	,
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 chose 	 n 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
related	to	the	idea	of	 collect 	 ive 	 	design	and	to	the	new	balance	between	the	individual	and	the	 collect 	 ive 	 ness 	 	,	 collect 	 ivity 	 	is	the	idea	of	 exist 	 ence 	 	 maxim 	 um 	 	.
that	's	a	term	that	i	 co 	 in 	 ed 	 	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	while	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	of	how	 press 	 ed 	 	we	are	together	,	and	at	the	same	time	how	these	small	 object 	 s 	 	,	like	the	walkman	first	and	then	the	ipod	,	create	 bubble 	 s 	 	of	space	around	us	that	 en 	 able 	 	us	to	have	a	 meta 	 physical 	 	space	that	is	much	 big 	 ger 	 	than	our	physical	space	.
you	can	be	in	the	 sub 	 way 	 	and	you	can	be	 complete 	 ly 	 	 isolate 	 d 	 	and	have	your	own	room	in	your	ipod	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	work	of	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 design 	 ers 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	enhance	the	idea	of	 s 	 ol 	 itude 	 	and	expansion	by	 mean 	 s 	 	of	 vari 	 ous 	 	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 s 	 pa 	 	 tele 	 phone 	 	.	the	idea	is	that	it	's	 be 	 come 	 	so	difficult	to	have	a	private	conversation	 any 	 where 	 
that	you	go	to	the	 s 	 pa 	 	,	you	have	a	 mass 	 age 	 	,	you	have	a	 fa 	 cial 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	a	rub	,	and	then	you	have	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	pool	with	 th 	 is 	 	perfect	temperature	,	and	you	can	have	 th 	 is 	 	 isol 	 ation 	 	tank	phone	conversation	with	 whom 	 ever 	 	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	 want 	 ing 	 	to	talk	with	for	a	long	time	.
and	same	thing	here	,	social	tele	-	presence	.	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	used	by	the	 militar 	 y 	 	a	little	bit	,	but	it	's	the	idea	of	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	be	 some 	 where 	 	else	with	your	 sense 	 s 	 	while	you	're	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	from	it	 physical 	 ly 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	blind	date	.	it	's	a	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	,	so	if	you	're	too	 s 	 hy 	 	to	be	 re 	 ally 	 	at	the	date	,	you	can	stay	at	a	distance	with	your	 flower 	 s 	 	and	 some 	 body 	 	else	 re 	 enact 	 s 	 	the	date	for	you	.
rapid	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	big	area	in	which	technology	and	design	are	,	i	think	,	bound	to	change	the	world	.	you	've	heard	about	it	before	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	.
rapid	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	is	a	computer	file	 s 	 ent 	 	 direct 	 ly 	 	from	the	computer	to	the	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	machine	.
it	used	to	be	 call 	 ed 	 	rapid	 proto 	 ty 	 ping 	 	,	rapid	 model 	 ing 	 	.
it	 start 	 ed 	 	out	in	the	'80s	,	but	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	it	was	 machine 	 s 	 	 carv 	 ing 	 	out	of	a	foam	block	a	model	that	was	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	fragile	,	and	could	not	have	any	real	use	.
 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	but	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	,	the	 material 	 s 	 	 be 	 came 	 	better	--	better	 re 	 s 	 in 	 s 	 	.
 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	 be 	 came 	 	better	--	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 carv 	 ing 	 	but	 al 	 so 	 	 stereo 	 lith 	 ography 	 	and	laser	--	 solid 	 ifying 	 	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 re 	 s 	 in 	 s 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	in	powder	or	in	liquid	form	.	and	the	 va 	 ts 	 	 be 	 came 	 	 big 	 ger 	 	,	to	the	point	that	now	we	can	have	actual	 chair 	 s 	 	made	by	rapid	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	.
it	 take 	 s 	 	seven	 day 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	to	 manufactur 	 e 	 	a	chair	,	but	you	know	what	?	one	day	it	will	take	seven	 hour 	 s 	 	.
and	then	the	dream	is	that	you	'll	be	able	to	,	from	home	,	 custom 	 ize 	 	your	chair	.	you	know	,	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	and	 design 	 ers 	 	will	be	 design 	 ing 	 	the	 m 	 atrix 	 	or	the	 margin 	 s 	 	that	respect	both	 solid 	 ity 	 	and	brand	,	and	design	 ident 	 ity 	 	.
and	then	you	can	 s 	 end 	 	it	to	the	kinko	's	store	at	the	corner	and	go	get	your	chair	.	now	,	the	 implic 	 ations 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	are	enormous	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 regard 	 ing 	 	the	 particip 	 ation 	 	of	the	final	 buy 	 er 	 	in	the	design	process	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	no	 track 	 ing 	 	,	no	 ware 	 housing 	 	,	no	 waste 	 d 	 	 material 	 s 	 	.
 al 	 so 	 	,	i	can	imagine	 man 	 y 	 	design	 manufactur 	 ers 	 	will	have	to	 re 	 tool 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	business	 plan 	 s 	 	and	 may 	 be 	 	invest	in	 th 	 is 	 	kinko	's	store	.	but	it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	a	big	change	.
and	here	i	'm	 show 	 ing 	 	a	picture	that	was	in	wired	magazine	--	you	know	,	the	 artifact 	 s 	 	of	the	future	section	that	i	love	so	much	--	that	 show 	 s 	 	you	can	have	your	 desk 	 top 	 	3d	 print 	 er 	 	and	print	your	own	 basket 	 ball 	 	.
but	here	 in 	 stead 	 	are	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	,	you	can	 al 	 ready 	 	3d	-	print	 text 	 ile 	 s 	 	,	which	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	just	a	 re 	 ally 	 	nice	touch	--	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	 s 	 low 	 	 proto 	 ty 	 ping 	 	.
it	's	a	 design 	 er 	 	that	put	10,000	bees	at	work	and	they	built	 th 	 is 	 	vase	.	they	had	a	 part 	 icular 	 	shape	that	they	had	to	stay	in	.
mapping	and	 tag 	 ging 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	of	 computer 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	big	,	and	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	of	our	mind	not	that	much	 big 	 ger 	 	,	we	find	that	we	need	to	tag	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	we	can	what	we	do	in	order	to	then	 re 	 trace 	 	our	path	.
 al 	 so 	 	,	we	do	it	in	order	to	share	with	other	people	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 commun 	 al 	 	sense	of	experience	that	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	so	 import 	 ant 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
so	,	 vari 	 ous 	 	ways	to	map	and	tag	are	 al 	 so 	 	the	work	of	 man 	 y 	 	 design 	 ers 	 	 now 	 a 	 day 	 s 	 	.
 al 	 so 	 	,	the	 sense 	 s 	 	--	 design 	 ers 	 	and	 scientist 	 s 	 	all	work	on	 try 	 ing 	 	to	expand	our	 sense 	 s 	 	 cap 	 abilities 	 	so	that	we	can	 achiev 	 e 	 	more	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	animal	 sense 	 s 	 	in	a	way	.
 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	object	that	 man 	 y 	 	people	love	so	much	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	based	on	kind	of	a	scientific	experiment	--	the	fact	that	bees	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	 ol 	 factor 	 y 	 	sense	,	and	so	--	much	like	 dog 	 s 	 	that	can	smell	certain	 kind 	 s 	 	of	skin	cancer	--	bees	can	be	trained	by	pavlovian	 re 	 flex 	 	to	detect	one	type	of	cancer	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	 pregn 	 ancy 	 	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	student	at	the	rca	designed	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	blown	-	glass	object	where	the	bees	move	from	one	chamber	to	the	other	if	they	detect	that	 part 	 icular 	 	smell	that	 sign 	 ifies 	 	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	 pregn 	 ancy 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	shape	is	made	for	cancer	.
design	for	debate	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	new	endeavor	that	 design 	 ers 	 	have	 re 	 ally 	 	shaped	for	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
some	 design 	 ers 	 	do	n't	design	 object 	 s 	 	,	 product 	 s 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	're	going	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	use	,	but	 ra 	 ther 	 	,	they	design	 scenario 	 s 	 	that	are	object	-	based	.
they	're	still	 ver 	 y 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	.
they	help	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	and	other	 design 	 ers 	 	think	better	about	the	future	.
and	 usual 	 ly 	 	they	are	 accompani 	 ed 	 	by	 video 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 quit 	 e 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.	it	's	dunne	and	raby	,	``	all	the	 robot 	 s 	 	.	``
 t 	 hose 	 	are	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 robot 	 s 	 	that	are	 me 	 ant 	 	to	be	taken	care	of	.
we	 al 	 ways 	 	think	that	 robot 	 s 	 	will	take	care	of	us	,	and	 in 	 stead 	 	they	designed	these	 robot 	 s 	 	that	are	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 need 	 y 	 	.
you	need	to	take	one	in	your	 arm 	 s 	 	and	look	at	it	in	the	 eye 	 s 	 	for	about	five	 minute 	 s 	 	before	it	 do 	 es 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	one	 get 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	nervous	if	you	get	in	to	the	room	,	and	 start 	 s 	 	 sha 	 king 	 	,	so	you	have	to	calm	it	down	.
so	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	a	way	to	make	us	think	more	about	what	 robot 	 s 	 	mean	to	us	.
noam	toran	and	``	 access 	 ories 	 	for	 lone 	 ly 	 	men	``	:
the	idea	is	that	when	you	lose	your	 love 	 d 	 	one	or	you	go	through	a	bad	 break 	 up 	 	,	what	you	 mis 	 s 	 	the	most	are	 t 	 hose 	 	 annoy 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	used	to	hate	when	you	 we 	 re 	 	with	the	other	person	.
so	he	designed	all	these	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 access 	 ories 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	one	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 take 	 s 	 	away	the	 sheet 	 s 	 	from	you	at	night	.
then	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	one	that	 breathe 	 s 	 	on	your	neck	.
there	's	 an 	 other 	 	one	that	 throw 	 s 	 	 plate 	 s 	 	and	 break 	 s 	 	them	.
so	it	's	just	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	what	we	 re 	 ally 	 	 mis 	 s 	 	in	life	.
elio	caccavale	:	he	took	the	idea	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 doll 	 s 	 	that	explain	leukemia	.
he	's	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 doll 	 s 	 	that	explain	 xeno 	 transplant 	 ation 	 	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	the	spider	gene	 in 	 to 	 	the	goat	,	from	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
he	's	 work 	 ing 	 	for	the	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	on	a	whole	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 doll 	 s 	 	that	explain	to	children	where	 bab 	 ies 	 	come	from	 to 	 day 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	not	 any 	 more 	 	mom	,	dad	,	the	 flower 	 s 	 	and	the	bees	,	and	then	there	's	the	baby	.	no	,	it	can	be	two	 mom 	 s 	 	,	three	 dad 	 s 	 	,	in	-	vitro	--	there	's	the	whole	idea	of	how	 bab 	 ies 	 	can	be	made	 to 	 day 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	.
so	it	's	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 doll 	 s 	 	that	he	's	 work 	 ing 	 	on	right	now	.
one	of	the	most	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	is	that	 design 	 ers 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	work	on	life	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	they	take	technology	 in 	 to 	 	account	.
and	 man 	 y 	 	 design 	 ers 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	on	the	idea	of	death	and	 mourn 	 ing 	 	,	and	what	we	can	do	about	it	 to 	 day 	 	with	new	 techno 	 logies 	 	.
or	how	we	should	 behav 	 e 	 	about	it	with	new	 techno 	 logies 	 	.
these	three	 object 	 s 	 	over	there	are	hard	 drive 	 s 	 	with	a	bluetooth	 connect 	 ion 	 	.	but	they	're	in	 re 	 ality 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 sculpt 	 ed 	 	 artifact 	 s 	 	that	contain	the	whole	 desk 	 top 	 	and	computer	 memor 	 y 	 	of	 some 	 body 	 	who	 pass 	 ed 	 	away	.
so	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	the	 picture 	 s 	 	,	you	will	be	able	to	put	 th 	 is 	 	object	next	to	the	computer	and	all	of	a	sudden	have	,	you	know	,	gertrude	's	whole	life	and	all	of	her	 file 	 s 	 	and	her	address	book	come	 al 	 ive 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	even	better	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	auger	-	loizeau	,	``	 after 	 life 	 	.	``
it	's	the	idea	that	some	people	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	in	an	 after 	 life 	 	.
so	to	give	them	 some 	 thing 	 	tangible	that	 show 	 s 	 	that	there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	after	death	,	they	take	the	 gas 	 tric 	 	 juice 	 s 	 	of	people	who	 pass 	 ed 	 	away	and	 concent 	 rate 	 	them	,	and	put	them	 in 	 to 	 	a	 batt 	 ery 	 	that	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	used	to	power	 flash 	 light 	 s 	 	.	they	 al 	 so 	 	go	--	you	know	,	 s 	 ex 	 	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	,	 what 	 ever 	 	.
it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	how	these	 thing 	 s 	 	can	make	you	 s 	 mile 	 	,	can	make	you	laugh	,	can	make	you	cry	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	.
but	i	'm	 hop 	 ing 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	will	be	able	to	trace	a	new	portrait	of	where	design	is	going	--	which	is	 al 	 ways 	 	,	 hope 	 fully 	 	,	a	portrait	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	in	advance	of	where	the	world	is	going	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
