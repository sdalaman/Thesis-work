 th 	 is 	 	is	tim	ferriss	circa	1979	a.d.	age	two	.
you	can	tell	by	the	power	squat	,	i	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	confident	boy	--
and	not	 with 	 out 	 	reason	.	i	had	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 charm 	 ing 	 	routine	at	the	time	,	which	was	to	wait	 un 	 til 	 	late	in	the	 even 	 ing 	 	when	my	 parent 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 de 	 compress 	 ing 	 	from	a	hard	day	's	work	,	 do 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 cross 	 word 	 	 puzzl 	 es 	 	,	 watch 	 ing 	 	 tele 	 vision 	 	.
i	would	run	 in 	 to 	 	the	living	room	,	jump	up	on	the	couch	,	rip	the	 cushion 	 s 	 	off	,	throw	them	on	the	floor	,	 s 	 cream 	 	at	the	top	of	my	 lung 	 s 	 	and	run	out
 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	the	 in 	 credible 	 	hulk	.
 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	you	see	the	 re 	 semblance 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	routine	went	on	for	some	time	.
when	i	was	seven	i	went	to	summer	camp	.
my	 parent 	 s 	 	found	it	 necess 	 ary 	 	for	peace	of	mind	.
and	at	noon	each	day
the	 camp 	 ers 	 	would	go	to	a	pond	,
where	they	had	 float 	 ing 	 	 dock 	 s 	 	.
you	could	jump	off	the	end	 in 	 to 	 	the	deep	end	.
i	was	born	 pre 	 mature 	 	.	i	was	 al 	 ways 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	small	.
my	left	lung	had	 collapse 	 d 	 	when	i	was	born	.
and	i	've	 al 	 ways 	 	had	 buoy 	 ancy 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	.
so	water	was	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 scar 	 ed 	 	me	to	begin	with	.
but	i	would	go	in	on	occasion	.
and	on	one	 part 	 icular 	 	day	,
the	 camp 	 ers 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 jump 	 ing 	 	through	inner	 tube 	 s 	 	,
they	 we 	 re 	 	 div 	 ing 	 	through	inner	 tube 	 s 	 	.	and	i	thought	 th 	 is 	 	would	be	great	 f 	 un 	 	.
so	i	dove	through	the	inner	tube	,
and	the	 bull 	 y 	 	of	the	camp	 grab 	 bed 	 	my	 ankle 	 s 	 	.
and	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	come	up	for	air	,
and	my	lower	back	hit	the	bottom	of	the	inner	tube	.
and	i	went	wild	eyed	and	thought	i	was	going	to	die	.
a	camp	 counsel 	 or 	 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	came	over	and	 separat 	 ed 	 	us	.
from	that	point	 on 	 ward 	 	i	was	 terr 	 ified 	 	of	 swimm 	 ing 	 	.
that	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	did	not	get	over	.
my	 in 	 ability 	 	to	swim	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 
one	of	my	 great 	 est 	 	 humil 	 iation 	 s 	 	and	 embarrass 	 ments 	 	.
that	is	when	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	i	was	not	the	 in 	 credible 	 	hulk	.
but	there	is	a	happy	 end 	 ing 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	story	.
at	age	31	--	that	's	my	age	now	--	in	august	i	took	two	 week 	 s 	 	to	re	-	examine	 swimm 	 ing 	 	,	and	question	all	the	of	the	obvious	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	of	 swimm 	 ing 	 	.
and	went	from	 swimm 	 ing 	 	one	lap	--	so	20	 yard 	 s 	 	--	like	a	 drown 	 ing 	 	monkey	,	at	about	200	 beat 	 s 	 	per	minute	heart	rate	--	i	 measur 	 ed 	 	it	--	to	going	to	montauk	on	long	 is 	 land 	 	,	close	to	where	i	grew	up	,	and	 jump 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	ocean	and	 swimm 	 ing 	 	one	kilometer	in	open	water	,	 get 	 ting 	 	out	and	 feel 	 ing 	 	better	than	when	i	went	in	.
and	i	came	out	,	in	my	speedos	,	european	style	,	 feel 	 ing 	 	like	the	 in 	 credible 	 	hulk	.
and	that	's	what	i	want	 every 	 one 	 	in	here	to	feel	like	,	the	 in 	 credible 	 	hulk	,	at	the	end	of	 th 	 is 	 	 present 	 ation 	 	.
more	 specific 	 ally 	 	,	i	want	you	to	feel	like	you	're	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 be 	 coming 	 	an	 excel 	 lent 	 	long	-	distance	 swimm 	 er 	 	,	a	world	-	class	language	 learn 	 er 	 	,	and	a	 tan 	 go 	 	champion	.
and	i	would	like	to	share	my	art	.
if	i	have	an	art	,	it	's	 de 	 construct 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 
that	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 care 	 	the	living	hell	out	of	me	.
so	,	moving	 on 	 ward 	 	.
 swimm 	 ing 	 	,	first	 principle 	 s 	 	.
first	 principle 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
i	find	that	the	best	 result 	 s 	 	in	life
are	often	held	back	by	false	 construct 	 s 	 	and	 un 	 tested 	 	 assumption 	 s 	 	.
and	the	 turn 	 around 	 	in	 swimm 	 ing 	 	came	when	a	friend	of	mine	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	will	go	a	year	 with 	 out 	 	any	 stimul 	 ants 	 	``	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	six	-	double	-	espresso	-	per	-	day	type	of	guy	--	``	if	you	can	complete	a	one	kilometer	open	water	race	.	``
so	the	clock	 start 	 ed 	 	 tick 	 ing 	 	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	seeking	out	 tri 	 athlete 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	found	that	 life 	 long 	 	 swimm 	 ers 	 	often	could	n't	teach	what	they	did	.
i	 tri 	 ed 	 	 kick 	 board 	 s 	 	.
my	feet	would	slice	through	the	water	like	 razor 	 s 	 	,
i	would	n't	even	move	.	i	would	 leav 	 e 	 	 de 	 moralize 	 d 	 	,	 star 	 ing 	 	at	my	feet	.
hand	 padd 	 les 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	.
even	did	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	with	olympians	--	 noth 	 ing 	 	 help 	 ed 	 	.
and	then	chris	sacca	,	who	is	now	a	dear	friend	mine	,	had	 complete 	 d 	 	an	iron	man	with	103	degree	temperature	,	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	have	the	answer	to	your	 pray 	 ers 	 	.	``
and	he	 introduc 	 ed 	 	me	to	the	work	of	a	man	named	terry	laughlin	who	is	the	founder	of	total	 immers 	 ion 	 	 swimm 	 ing 	 	.
that	set	me	on	the	road	to	 exa 	 min 	 ing 	 	 bio 	 mechanic 	 s 	 	.
so	here	are	the	new	 rule 	 s 	 	of	 swimm 	 ing 	 	,
if	any	of	you	are	 af 	 raid 	 	of	 swimm 	 ing 	 	,	or	not	good	at	it	.
the	first	is	,	forget	about	 kick 	 ing 	 	.	 ver 	 y 	 	 counter 	 intuitive 	 	.
so	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	 pro 	 pulsion 	 	is	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	the	problem	.
 kick 	 ing 	 	 hard 	 er 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	solve	the	problem
 be 	 cause 	 	the	average	 swimm 	 er 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 transfer 	 s 	 	about	three	percent
of	 the 	 ir 	 	energy	 expend 	 iture 	 	 in 	 to 	 	forward	motion	.
the	problem	is	 hydro 	 dynamic 	 s 	 	.
so	what	you	want	to	focus	on	 in 	 stead 	 	is	 allow 	 ing 	 	your	lower	body	to	draft	 be 	 hind 	 	your	upper	body	,	much	like	a	small	car	 be 	 hind 	 	a	big	car	on	the	 high 	 way 	 	.
and	you	do	that	by	 maintain 	 ing 	 	a	 horizon 	 tal 	 	body	position	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	you	can	do	that
is	to	not	swim	on	top	of	the	water	.
the	body	is	 den 	 s 	 er 	 	than	water	.	95	percent	of	it	would	be	,
at	 l 	 east 	 	,	 sub 	 merge 	 d 	 	 natural 	 ly 	 	.
so	you	end	up	,	number	three	,	not	 swimm 	 ing 	 	,	in	the	case	of	 free 	 style 	 	,	on	your	stomach	,	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	think	,	 reach 	 ing 	 	on	top	of	the	water	.
but	 actual 	 ly 	 	 rot 	 ating 	 	from	 stream 	 lined 	 	right	to	 stream 	 lined 	 	left	,	 maintain 	 ing 	 	that	 fuse 	 l 	 age 	 	position	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	possible	.
so	let	's	look	at	some	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	terry	.
and	you	can	see	that	he	's	 extend 	 ing 	 	his	right	arm
 be 	 low 	 	his	head	and	far	in	front	.
and	so	his	entire	body	 re 	 ally 	 	is	 under 	 water 	 	.
the	arm	is	 extend 	 ed 	 	 be 	 low 	 	the	head	.
the	head	is	held	in	line	with	the	 s 	 pine 	 	,	so	that	you	use	 strat 	 egic 	 	water	pressure	to	raise	your	 leg 	 s 	 	up	--	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	for	people	with	lower	body	fat	.
here	is	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	the	stroke	.
so	you	do	n't	kick	.	but	you	do	use	a	small	flick	.
you	can	see	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	left	 extens 	 ion 	 	.
then	you	see	his	left	leg	.
small	flick	,	and	the	 on 	 ly 	 	purpose	of	that
is	to	 rot 	 ate 	 	his	 hip 	 s 	 	so	he	can	get	to	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	side	.
and	the	entry	point	for	his	right	hand	--	notice	 th 	 is 	 	,
he	's	not	 reach 	 ing 	 	in	front	and	 catch 	 ing 	 	the	water	.
 ra 	 ther 	 	,	he	is	 enter 	 ing 	 	the	water
at	a	45	-	degree	angle	with	his	 fore 	 arm 	 	,
and	then	 propel 	 ling 	 	 him 	 self 	 	by	 stream 	 lining 	 	--	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
 in 	 correct 	 	,	above	,	which	is	what	 al 	 most 	 	every	 swimm 	 ing 	 	coach	will	teach	you	.
not	 the 	 ir 	 	fault	,	 honest 	 ly 	 	.
and	i	'll	get	to	 im 	 plicit 	 	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	 ex 	 plicit 	 	in	a	moment	.
 be 	 low 	 	is	what	most	 swimm 	 ers 	 	will	find	 en 	 able 	 s 	 	them	to	do	what	i	did	,	which	is	going	from	21	 stroke 	 s 	 	per	20	-	yard	length	to	11	 stroke 	 s 	 
in	two	 work 	 out 	 s 	 	with	no	coach	,	no	video	 monitor 	 ing 	 	.
and	now	i	love	 swimm 	 ing 	 	.	i	ca	n't	wait	to	go	 swimm 	 ing 	 	.
i	'll	be	 do 	 ing 	 	a	 swimm 	 ing 	 	 less 	 on 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	for	 my 	 self 	 	,	if	 any 	 one 	 	 want 	 s 	 	to	join	me	.
last	thing	,	 breath 	 ing 	 	.	a	problem	a	lot	of	us	have	,	 certain 	 ly 	 	,	when	you	're	 swimm 	 ing 	 	.
in	 free 	 style 	 	,	 eas 	 iest 	 	way	to	 re 	 med 	 y 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	to	turn	with	body	roll	,	and	just	to	look	at	your	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	hand	 a 	 s 	 	it	 enter 	 s 	 	the	water	.
and	that	will	get	you	 ver 	 y 	 	far	.
that	's	it	.	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	all	you	need	to	know	.
 language 	 s 	 	.	material	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	method	.
i	,	like	 man 	 y 	 	people	,	came	to	the	 con 	 clusion 	 
that	i	was	 terr 	 ible 	 	at	 language 	 s 	 	.
i	 suffer 	 ed 	 	through	spanish	for	 juni 	 or 	 	high	,	first	year	of	high	school	,
and	the	sum	total	of	my	knowledge
was	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	,	``	donde	esta	el	 ban 	 o 	 	?	``
and	i	would	n't	even	catch	the	 respons 	 e 	 	.	a	 s 	 ad 	 	state	of	 af 	 fair 	 s 	 	.
then	i	 transfer 	 red 	 	to	a	different	school	 s 	 op 	 homo 	 re 	 	year	,	and
i	had	a	choice	of	other	 language 	 s 	 	.	most	of	my	 friend 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	taking	japanese	.
so	i	thought	why	not	punish	 my 	 self 	 	?	i	'll	do	japanese	.
six	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	i	had	the	chance	to	go	to	japan	.
my	 teacher 	 s 	 	 assur 	 ed 	 	me	,	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	do	n't	worry	.	you	'll	have	japanese	language	 class 	 es 	 	every	day	to	help	you	cope	.
it	will	be	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	experience	.	``	my	first	 over 	 sea 	 s 	 	experience	in	fact	.
so	my	 parent 	 s 	 	 encourag 	 ed 	 	me	to	do	it	.	i	left	.
i	 arriv 	 ed 	 	in	tokyo	.	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
i	could	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	i	was	on	the	other	side	of	the	world	.
i	met	my	host	family	.	 thing 	 s 	 	went	 quit 	 e 	 	well	i	think	,
all	 thing 	 s 	 	 consider 	 ed 	 	.
my	first	 even 	 ing 	 	,	before	my	first	day	of	school	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	to	my	mother	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 polite 	 ly 	 	,	``	 pleas 	 e 	 	wake	me	up	at	eight	 a.m 	 . 	 	``	so	,

i	 walk 	 ed 	 	in	to	school	.
and	a	teacher	came	up	to	me	and	 hand 	 ed 	 	me	a	piece	of	paper	.
i	could	n't	read	any	of	it	--	hieroglyphics	,	it	could	have	 be 	 en 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	kanji	,	chinese	 character 	 s 	 	 adapt 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	japanese	language	.

and	that	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	my	 respons 	 e 	 	.
and	that	set	me	on	 th 	 is 	 	panic	driven	search	for	the	perfect	language	method	.

 noth 	 ing 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	 un 	 til 	 	i	found	 th 	 is 	 	.

and	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 came 	 	my	holy	 g 	 rail 	 	,	my	rosetta	stone	.
 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	i	focused	on	 th 	 is 	 	material	,	i	took	off	.

 th 	 is 	 	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	us	to	the	point	,	which	is	,	it	's	 often 	 time 	 s 	 	what	you	do	,	not	how	you	do	it	,	that	is	the	 determi 	 ning 	 	factor	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	 be 	 ing 	 	effective	--	 do 	 ing 	 	the	right	 thing 	 s 	 	--	and	 be 	 ing 	 	efficient	--	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	well	 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	they	're	 import 	 ant 	 	.
you	can	 al 	 so 	 	do	 th 	 is 	 	with	 gram 	 mar 	 	.
i	came	up	with	these	six	 sentence 	 s 	 	after	much	 experiment 	 ation 	 	.

from	that	point	,	you	can	then	,	if	you	want	to	,	 acquir 	 e 	 	 multi 	 ple 	 	 language 	 s 	 	,	alternate	them	so	there	is	no	 inter 	 ference 	 	.
we	can	talk	about	that	if	 any 	 one 	 	in	 interest 	 ed 	 	.

she	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 piss 	 ed 	 	off	that	i	had	 pull 	 ed 	 	her	from	her	 advance 	 d 	 	practice	.
so	i	did	my	best	.	i	did	n't	know	where	to	put	my	 hand 	 s 	 	.
and	she	 pull 	 ed 	 	back	,	threw	down	her	 arm 	 s 	 	,	put	them	on	her	 hip 	 s 	 	,	 turn 	 ed 	 	around	and	 yell 	 ed 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	room	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	guy	is	built	like	a	god	-	 damn 	 ed 	 	mountain	of	muscle	,	and	he	's	 grab 	 bing 	 	me	like	a	 fuck 	 ing 	 	frenchman	,	``	which	i	found	 encourag 	 ing 	 	.
 every 	 one 	 	burst	 in 	 to 	 	laughter	.	i	was	 humil 	 iated 	 	.
she	came	back	.	she	 go 	 es 	 	,	``	come	on	.	i	do	n't	have	all	day	.	``
 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 one 	 	who	 wrestl 	 ed 	 	since	age	eight	,	i	 proceed 	 ed 	 	to	crush	her	,	``	of	 mic 	 e 	 	and	men	``	style	.
and	she	 look 	 ed 	 	up	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,
``	now	that	's	better	.	``
so	i	 b 	 ought 	 	a	month	's	worth	of	 class 	 es 	 	.
and	 proceed 	 ed 	 	to	look	at	--	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	set	 com 	 petition 	 	so	i	'd	have	a	 dead 	 line 	 	--	parkinson	's	law	,	the	 perceive 	 d 	 	 complex 	 ity 	 	of	a	task	will	expand	to	fill	the	time	you	 al 	 lot 	 	it	.
so	i	had	a	 ver 	 y 	 	short	 dead 	 line 	 	for	a	 com 	 petition 	 	.
i	got	a	female	 instruct 	 or 	 	first	,	to	teach	me	the	female	role	,	the	follow	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	understand	the	 sensitiv 	 ities 	 	and	abilities	that	the	follow	 need 	 ed 	 	to	develop	,	so	i	would	n't	have	a	repeat	of	college	.
and	then	i	took	an	 inventor 	 y 	 	of	the	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 long 	 	with	her	,	of	the
of	the	 cap 	 abilities 	 	and	 element 	 s 	 	of	different	 danc 	 ers 	 	who	'd	won	 champion 	 ship 	 s 	 	.
i	 interview 	 ed 	 	these	people	 be 	 cause 	 	they	all	taught	in	buenos	aires	.
i	 compar 	 ed 	 	the	two	 list 	 s 	 	,	and	what	you	find	is	that	there	is	 ex 	 plicit 	 ly 	 	,	 expert 	 ise 	 	they	 recommend 	 ed 	 	,	certain	training	 method 	 s 	 	.
then	there	 we 	 re 	 	 im 	 plicit 	 	 common 	 al 	 ities 	 	that	 non 	 e 	 	of	them	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	be	 p 	 rac 	 tic 	 ing 	 	.
now	the	 protect 	 ion 	 ism 	 	of	argentine	dance	 teacher 	 s 	 	 a 	 side 	 	,	i	found	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.	so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	focus	on	three	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 common 	 al 	 ities 	 	.
long	 step 	 s 	 	.	so	a	lot	of	 milo 	 ngueros 	 	--	the	 tan 	 go 	 	 danc 	 ers 	 	will	use	 ver 	 y 	 	short	 step 	 s 	 	.
i	found	that	 long 	 er 	 	 step 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	much	more	elegant	.
so	you	can	have	--
and	you	can	do	it	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	space	in	fact	.
 second 	 ly 	 	,	different	 type 	 s 	 	of	 pivot 	 s 	 	.
 third 	 ly 	 	,	 vari 	 ation 	 	in	tempo	.
these	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	be	the	three	 area 	 s 	 	that	i	could	exploit	to	compete	if	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 com 	 pt 	 ete 	 	against	people	who	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 p 	 rac 	 tic 	 ing 	 	for	20	to	30	 year 	 s 	 	.
that	photo	is	of	the
semi	-	 final 	 s 	 	of	the	buenos	aires	 champion 	 ship 	 s 	 	,	four	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
then	one	month	 lat 	 er 	 	,	went	to	the	world	 champion 	 ship 	 s 	 	,
made	it	to	the	semi	-	final	.	and	then	set	a	world	record	,	 follow 	 ing 	 	that	,
two	 week 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
i	want	you	to	see	part	of	what	i	 practice 	 d 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	jump	forward	here	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 instruct 	 or 	 	that	alicia	and	i	chose	for	the	male	lead	.
his	name	is	gabriel	misse	.
one	of	the	most	elegant	 danc 	 ers 	 	of	his	generation	,	known	for	his	long	 step 	 s 	 	,	and	his	tempo	 change 	 s 	 
and	his	 pivot 	 s 	 	.
alicia	,	in	her	own	right	,	 ver 	 y 	 	famous	.
so	i	think	you	'll	agree	,	they	look	 quit 	 e 	 	good	together	.
now	what	i	like	about	 th 	 is 	 	video	is	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	video	of	the	first	time	they	ever	 danc 	 ed 	 	together
 be 	 cause 	 	of	his	lead	.	he	had	a	strong	lead	.
he	did	n't	lead	with	his	chest	,	which	 requir 	 es 	 	you	lean	forward	.
i	could	n't	develop	the	 attribut 	 es 	 	in	my	 to 	 es 	 	,
the	strength	in	my	feet	,	to	do	that	.
so	he	uses	a	lead	that	 focus 	 es 	 	on
his	shoulder	 gird 	 le 	 	and	his	arm	.
so	he	can	lift	the	woman	to	break	her	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
that	's	just	one	benefit	of	that	.
so	then	we	broke	it	down	.
 th 	 is 	 	would	be	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	one	pivot	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	back	step	pivot	.
there	are	 man 	 y 	 	different	 type 	 s 	 	.
i	have	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 hour 	 s 	 	of	 foot 	 age 	 	--
all	 categor 	 ized 	 	,	much	like	george	carlin
 categor 	 ized 	 	his	 come 	 dy 	 	.
so	using	my	arch	-	nemesis	,
spanish	,	no	less	,	to	learn	 tan 	 go 	 	.
so	fear	is	your	friend	.	fear	is	an	 indic 	 ator 	 	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	it	 show 	 s 	 	you	what	you	should	n't	do	.
more	often	than	not	it	 show 	 s 	 	you	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	you	should	do	.
and	the	best	 result 	 s 	 	that	i	've	had	in	life	,	the	most	 enjoy 	 able 	 	 time 	 s 	 	,	have	all	 be 	 en 	 	from	 ask 	 ing 	 	a	simple	question	:
what	's	the	worst	that	can	happen	?
 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	with	 fear 	 s 	 	you	 gain 	 ed 	 	when	you	 we 	 re 	 	a	child	.
take	the	 analytic 	 al 	 	 frame 	 work 	 s 	 	,	the	 cap 	 abilities 	 	you	have	,	 app 	 ly 	 	them	to	old	 fear 	 s 	 	.
 app 	 ly 	 	them	to	 ver 	 y 	 	big	 dream 	 s 	 	.
and	when	i	think	of	what	i	fear	now	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	.
when	i	imagine	my	life	,	what	my	life	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	like	 with 	 out 	 	the	 education 	 al 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	that	i	had	,	it	 make 	 s 	 	me	wonder	.
i	've	 s 	 pent 	 	the	last	two	 year 	 s 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 de 	 construct 	 	the	american	public	school	system	,
to	either	fix	it	or	replace	it	.
and	have	 d 	 one 	 	 experiment 	 s 	 	with	about	50,000	 student 	 s 	 	thus	far	--	built	,	i	'd	say	,	about	a	half	dozen	 school 	 s 	 	,	my	 read 	 ers 	 	,	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	.
and	if	any	of	you	are	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	that	,	i	would	love	to	speak	with	you	.
i	know	 noth 	 ing 	 	.	i	'm	a	 beg 	 inner 	 	.
but	i	ask	a	lot	of	 question 	 s 	 	,	and	i	would	love	your	 ad 	 vice 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
