to	be	new	at	ted	--	it	's	like	 be 	 ing 	 	the	last	high	-	school	virgin	.
you	know	that	all	of	the	cool	people	are	--	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
and	you	're	on	the	 out 	 side 	 	,	you	're	at	home	.	you	're	like	the	raspyni	 brother 	 s 	 	,	where	you	've	got	your	 ball 	 s 	 	in	cold	water	.	and	--	--	you	just	play	with	your	 finger 	 s 	 	all	day	.	and	then	you	get	 invit 	 ed 	 	.
and	you	're	on	the	 in 	 side 	 	,	and	it	's	 every 	 thing 	 	you	 hop 	 ed 	 	it	would	be	.
it	's	 excit 	 ing 	 	and	there	's	music	 play 	 ing 	 	all	of	the	time	and	then	 sudden 	 ly 	 	it	's	over	.	and	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	taken	five	 minute 	 s 	 	.
and	you	want	to	go	back	and	do	it	 aga 	 in 	 	.	but	i	 re 	 ally 	 	appreciate	 be 	 ing 	 	here	.	and	thank	you	,	chris	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	,	thank	you	,	deborah	patton	,	for	making	 th 	 is 	 	possible	.
so	 any 	 way 	 	,	 to 	 day 	 	we	'll	talk	about	 architect 	 ure 	 	a	little	bit	,	 with 	 in 	 	the	subject	of	creation	and	 optim 	 ism 	 	.
and	if	you	put	creation	and	 optim 	 ism 	 	together	,	you	've	got	two	 choice 	 s 	 	that	you	can	talk	about	.
you	can	talk	about	 creation 	 ism 	 	--	which	i	think	would	n't	go	down	well	with	 th 	 is 	 	audience	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	not	from	a	view	where	you	 we 	 re 	 	a	proponent	of	it	--	or	you	can	talk	about	optimisations	,	 spell 	 ed 	 	the	british	way	,	with	an	s	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	a	z	.
and	i	think	that	's	what	i	'd	like	to	talk	about	 to 	 day 	 	.
but	any	kind	of	conversation	about	 architect 	 ure 	 	--	which	is	,	in	fact	,	what	you	 we 	 re 	 	just	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	,	what	was	going	on	here	,	setting	up	ted	,	small	-	scale	 architect 	 ure 	 	--	at	the	present	time	ca	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	happen	 with 	 out 	 	a	conversation	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	the	world	trade	center	,	and	what	's	 be 	 en 	 	going	on	there	,	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	to	us	.
 be 	 cause 	 	if	 architect 	 ure 	 	is	what	i	 believ 	 e 	 	it	to	be	,	which	is	the	built	form	of	our	cultural	 ambit 	 ions 	 	,	what	do	you	do	when	 present 	 ed 	 	with	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	 rect 	 ify 	 	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	that	 represent 	 s 	 	 some 	 body 	 	else	's	cultural	 ambit 	 ions 	 	 relat 	 ive 	 	to	us	?	and	our	own	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	make	 some 	 thing 	 	new	there	?
 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 galvan 	 izing 	 	issue	for	a	long	time	.
i	think	that	the	world	trade	center	in	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	an	 un 	 fortunate 	 	way	,	 br 	 ought 	 	 architect 	 ure 	 	 in 	 to 	 	focus	in	a	way	that	i	do	n't	think	people	had	thought	of	in	a	long	time	,	and	made	it	a	subject	for	common	conversation	.
i	do	n't	remember	,	in	my	20	-	year	 care 	 er 	 	of	 p 	 rac 	 tic 	 ing 	 	and	writing	about	 architect 	 ure 	 	,	a	time	when	five	people	 s 	 at 	 	me	down	at	a	table	and	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	 ver 	 y 	 	serious	 question 	 s 	 	about	 zon 	 ing 	 	,	fire	 exit 	 ing 	 	,	 safe 	 ty 	 	 concern 	 s 	 	and	 whet 	 her 	 	carpet	 burn 	 s 	 	.
these	are	just	not	 thing 	 s 	 	we	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	 ver 	 y 	 	often	.
and	yet	,	now	,	it	's	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	all	the	time	.
at	the	point	where	you	can	weaponize	your	 building 	 s 	 	,	you	have	to	 sudden 	 ly 	 	think	about	 architect 	 ure 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	way	.
and	so	now	we	're	going	to	think	about	 architect 	 ure 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	way	,	we	're	going	to	think	about	it	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	saw	usa	 to 	 day 	 	,	 to 	 day 	 	?	there	it	is	.	 look 	 s 	 	like	that	.
there	's	the	world	trade	center	 s 	 ite 	 	,	on	the	front	cover	.
they	've	made	a	 s 	 election 	 	.
they	've	 chose 	 n 	 	a	project	by	daniel	libeskind	,	the	enfant	 terr 	 ible 	 	of	the	moment	of	 architect 	 ure 	 	.
child	-	 pro 	 dig 	 y 	 	piano	player	,	he	 start 	 ed 	 	on	the	squeezebox	,	and	 move 	 d 	 	to	a	little	more	serious	issue	,	a	 big 	 ger 	 	instrument	,	and	now	to	an	even	 large 	 r 	 	instrument	,	 up 	 on 	 	which	to	work	his	 part 	 icular 	 	brand	of	deconstructivist	magic	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	see	here	.
he	was	one	of	six	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	 invit 	 ed 	 	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 com 	 petition 	 	,	after	six	previous	 firm 	 s 	 	 s 	 truck 	 	out	with	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	so	stupid	and	 ban 	 al 	 	that	even	the	city	of	new	york	was	 force 	 d 	 	to	go	,	``	oh	,	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	sorry	,	we	 screw 	 ed 	 	up	.	``
right	.	can	we	do	 th 	 is 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	from	the	top	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	use	some	people	with	a	vague	hint	of	talent	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	just	six	utter	boobs	like	we	 br 	 ought 	 	in	last	time	,	real	 e 	 state 	 	 hack 	 s 	 	of	the	kind	who	 usual 	 ly 	 	plan	our	cities	.
let	's	 br 	 ing 	 	in	some	real	 architect 	 s 	 	for	a	change	.
and	so	we	got	 th 	 is 	 	,	or	we	had	a	choice	of	that	.	oh	,	stop	 clap 	 ping 	 	.
it	's	too	late	.	that	is	gone	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	scheme	by	a	team	 call 	 ed 	 	think	,	a	new	york	-	based	team	,	and	then	there	was	that	one	,	which	was	the	libeskind	scheme	.
 th 	 is 	 	one	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	be	the	new	world	trade	center	:
a	giant	hole	in	the	ground	with	big	 building 	 s 	 	 fall 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	it	.
now	,	i	do	n't	know	what	you	think	,	but	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	stupid	decision	,	 be 	 cause 	 	what	you	've	 d 	 one 	 	is	just	made	a	permanent	memorial	to	 destruct 	 ion 	 	by	making	it	look	like	the	 destruct 	 ion 	 	is	going	to	 continu 	 e 	 	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
but	that	's	what	we	're	going	to	do	.
but	i	want	you	to	think	about	these	 thing 	 s 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	a	kind	of	 on 	 going 	 	struggle	that	american	 architect 	 ure 	 	 represent 	 s 	 	,	and	that	these	two	 thing 	 s 	 	talk	about	 ver 	 y 	 	 specific 	 ally 	 	.
and	that	is	the	wild	 diverge 	 nce 	 	in	how	we	 choos 	 e 	 	our	 architect 	 s 	 	,	in	 try 	 ing 	 	to	decide	 whet 	 her 	 	we	want	 architect 	 ure 	 	from	the	kind	of	technocratic	solution	to	 every 	 thing 	 	--	that	there	is	a	large	,	technical	answer	that	can	solve	all	 problem 	 s 	 	,	be	they	social	,	be	they	physical	,	be	they	chemical	--	or	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	more	of	a	romantic	solution	.
now	,	i	do	n't	mean	romantic	 a 	 s 	 	in	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	nice	place	to	take	 some 	 one 	 	on	a	date	.
i	mean	romantic	in	the	sense	of	,	there	are	 thing 	 s 	 	 large 	 r 	 	and	 grand 	 er 	 	than	us	.
so	,	in	the	american	tradition	,	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	the	technocratic	and	the	romantic	,	would	be	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	thomas	jefferson	's	cartesian	 grid 	 s 	 	 spread 	 ing 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	that	 give 	 s 	 	us	 bas 	 ically 	 	the	whole	shape	of	every	western	state	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 tru 	 ly 	 	,	technocratic	solution	,	a	 bow 	 ing 	 	to	the	--	in	jefferson	's	time	--	current	,	popular	 philosoph 	 y 	 	of	 rational 	 ism 	 	.
or	the	way	we	went	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	that	 lat 	 er 	 	:	manifest	 de 	 s 	 tin 	 y 	 	.
now	,	which	would	you	 ra 	 ther 	 	be	?	a	grid	,	or	manifest	 de 	 s 	 tin 	 y 	 	?
manifest	 de 	 s 	 tin 	 y 	 	.
it	's	a	big	deal	.	it	 sound 	 s 	 	big	,	it	 sound 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	it	 sound 	 s 	 	solid	.	it	 sound 	 s 	 	american	.	 ball 	 s 	 y 	 	,	serious	,	male	.
and	that	kind	of	fight	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	on	back	and	forth	in	 architect 	 ure 	 	all	the	time	.
i	mean	,	it	 go 	 es 	 	on	in	our	private	 live 	 s 	 	,	too	,	every	single	day	.
we	all	want	to	go	out	and	buy	an	audi	tt	,	do	n't	we	?
 every 	 one 	 	here	must	own	one	,	or	at	 l 	 east 	 	they	craved	one	the	moment	they	saw	one	.
and	then	they	hopped	in	it	,	 turn 	 ed 	 	the	little	 electron 	 ic 	 	key	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	the	real	key	,	 zip 	 ped 	 	home	on	 the 	 ir 	 	new	superhighway	,	and	drove	straight	 in 	 to 	 	a	 gar 	 age 	 	that	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	tudor	castle	.
why	?	why	?	why	do	you	want	to	do	that	?
why	do	we	all	want	to	do	that	?	i	even	owned	a	tudor	thing	once	 my 	 self 	 	.
it	's	in	our	nature	to	go	ricocheting	back	and	forth	between	 th 	 is 	 	technocratic	solution	and	a	 large 	 r 	 	,	sort	of	more	romantic	image	of	where	we	are	.
so	we	're	going	to	go	straight	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
can	i	have	the	 light 	 s 	 	off	for	a	moment	?
i	'm	going	to	talk	about	two	 architect 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 brief 	 ly 	 	that	represent	the	current	split	,	architecturally	,	between	these	two	 tradition 	 s 	 	of	a	technocratic	or	 techno 	 logical 	 	solution	and	a	romantic	solution	.
and	these	are	two	of	the	top	 architect 	 ural 	 	 practice 	 s 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.	one	 ver 	 y 	 	young	,	one	a	little	more	mature	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	work	of	a	firm	 call 	 ed 	 	shop	,	and	what	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	here	,	is	 the 	 ir 	 	 iso 	 metric 	 	 draw 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	what	will	be	a	large	-	scale	camera	obscura	in	a	public	park	.
 do 	 es 	 	 every 	 body 	 	know	what	a	camera	obscura	is	?
 yea 	 h 	 	,	it	's	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	giant	camera	 lens 	 es 	 	that	 take 	 s 	 	a	picture	of	the	 out 	 side 	 	world	--	it	's	sort	of	a	little	movie	,	 with 	 out 	 	any	moving	 part 	 s 	 	--	and	 project 	 s 	 	it	on	a	page	,	and	you	can	see	the	world	 out 	 side 	 	you	 a 	 s 	 	you	walk	around	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	just	the	 out 	 line 	 	of	it	,	and	you	can	see	,	 do 	 es 	 	it	look	like	a	regular	building	?	no	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	non	-	 ortho 	 gon 	 al 	 	:	it	's	not	up	and	down	,	square	,	 rect 	 angular 	 	,	 any 	 thing 	 	like	that	,	that	you	'd	see	in	a	normal	shape	of	a	building	.
the	computer	revolution	,	the	technocratic	,	 techno 	 logical 	 	revolution	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 allow 	 ed 	 	us	to	jettison	normal	-	shaped	 building 	 s 	 	,	 tradition 	 ally 	 	shaped	 building 	 s 	 	,	in	favor	of	non	-	 ortho 	 gon 	 al 	 	 building 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	about	it	is	not	the	shape	.
what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	about	it	is	how	it	's	made	.	how	it	's	made	.
a	brand	-	new	way	to	put	 building 	 s 	 	together	,	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	mass	 custom 	 ization 	 	.	no	,	it	is	not	an	 oxy 	 moron 	 	.
what	 make 	 s 	 	the	building	expensive	,	in	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	sense	,	is	making	individual	 part 	 s 	 	custom	,	that	you	ca	n't	do	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	.
that	's	why	we	all	live	in	 develop 	 er 	 	 house 	 s 	 	.
they	all	want	to	 s 	 ave 	 	money	by	building	the	same	thing	500	 time 	 s 	 	.
that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 cheap 	 er 	 	.
mass	 custom 	 ization 	 	 work 	 s 	 	by	an	architect	 feed 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	computer	,	a	program	that	 say 	 s 	 	,	 manufactur 	 e 	 	these	 part 	 s 	 	.
the	computer	then	 talk 	 s 	 	to	a	machine	--	a	computer	-	 oper 	 ated 	 	machine	,	a	cad	-	cam	machine	--	that	can	make	a	zillion	different	 change 	 s 	 	,	at	a	moment	's	notice	,
 be 	 cause 	 	the	computer	is	just	a	machine	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	care	.	it	's	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	the	 part 	 s 	 	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	see	any	excess	cost	.	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 s 	 pend 	 	any	extra	time	.
it	's	not	a	 labor 	 er 	 	--	it	's	 simpl 	 y 	 	an	 electron 	 ic 	 	 la 	 the 	 	,	so	the	 part 	 s 	 	can	all	be	cut	at	the	same	time	.
 mean 	 while 	 	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	 some 	 one 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	 draw 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	which	are	 t 	 hose 	 	huge	 set 	 s 	 	of	 blue 	 print 	 s 	 	that	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	your	whole	life	,	what	the	architect	can	do	is	 s 	 end 	 	a	set	of	 assem 	 bly 	 	 instruct 	 ions 	 	,	like	you	used	to	get	when	you	 we 	 re 	 	a	child	,	when	you	 b 	 ought 	 	little	 model 	 s 	 	that	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	bolt	a	to	b	,	and	c	to	d.	``
and	so	what	the	 build 	 er 	 	will	get	is	every	single	individual	part	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	custom	 manufactur 	 ed 	 	off	-	 s 	 ite 	 	and	 deliver 	 ed 	 	on	a	truck	to	the	 s 	 ite 	 	,	to	that	 build 	 er 	 	,	and	a	set	of	these	 instruct 	 ion 	 	 manual 	 s 	 	.
just	simple	``	bolt	a	to	b	``	and	they	will	be	able	to	put	them	together	.	here	's	the	little	 draw 	 ing 	 	that	 tell 	 s 	 	them	how	that	 work 	 s 	 	--	and	that	's	what	will	happen	in	the	end	.
you	're	 under 	 neath 	 	it	,	looking	up	 in 	 to 	 	the	lens	of	the	camera	obscura	.
 l 	 est 	 	you	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	fiction	,	 l 	 est 	 	you	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	 fanta 	 s 	 y 	 	,	or	 rom 	 ance 	 	,	these	same	 architect 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	produce	 some 	 thing 	 	for	the	central	 court 	 yard 	 	of	ps	1	,	which	is	a	museum	in	brooklyn	,	new	york	,	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	 the 	 ir 	 	young	 architect 	 s 	 	summer	 s 	 eries 	 	.
and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	well	,	it	's	summer	,	what	do	you	do	?
in	the	summer	,	you	go	to	the	beach	.
and	when	you	go	to	the	beach	,	what	do	you	get	?	you	get	sand	 dune 	 s 	 	.
so	let	's	make	 architect 	 ural 	 	sand	 dune 	 s 	 	and	a	beach	cabana	.
so	they	went	out	and	they	 model 	 ed 	 	a	computer	model	of	a	sand	dune	.
they	took	 photograph 	 s 	 	,	they	fed	the	 photograph 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	computer	program	,	and	that	computer	program	shaped	a	sand	dune	and	then	took	that	sand	dune	shape	and	 turn 	 ed 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	--	at	 the 	 ir 	 	 instruct 	 ions 	 	,	using	standard	 soft 	 ware 	 	with	 s 	 light 	 	 mod 	 ification 	 s 	 	--	a	set	of	 instruct 	 ions 	 	for	 piece 	 s 	 	of	wood	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	 piece 	 s 	 	of	wood	.	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	 instruct 	 ions 	 	.
these	are	the	 piece 	 s 	 	,	and	here	's	a	little	of	that	blown	up	.
what	you	can	see	is	there	's	about	six	different	 color 	 s 	 	,	and	each	color	 represent 	 s 	 	a	type	of	wood	to	be	cut	,	a	piece	of	wood	to	be	cut	.
all	of	which	 we 	 re 	 	 deliver 	 ed 	 	by	flat	bed	,	on	a	truck	,	and	hand	 assemble 	 d 	 	in	48	 hour 	 s 	 	by	a	team	of	eight	people	,	 on 	 ly 	 	one	of	whom	had	ever	 s 	 een 	 	the	 plan 	 s 	 	before	.
 on 	 ly 	 	one	of	whom	had	ever	 s 	 een 	 	the	 plan 	 s 	 	before	.
and	here	 come 	 s 	 	dune	-	scape	,	coming	up	out	of	the	 court 	 yard 	 	,	and	there	it	is	fully	built	.
there	are	 on 	 ly 	 	16	different	 piece 	 s 	 	of	wood	,
 on 	 ly 	 	16	different	 assem 	 bly 	 	 part 	 s 	 	here	.
 look 	 s 	 	like	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	piano	 sound 	 ing 	 	board	on	the	 in 	 side 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	own	built	-	in	 swimm 	 ing 	 	pool	,	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	cool	.
it	's	a	great	place	for	 part 	 ies 	 	--	it	was	,	it	was	 on 	 ly 	 	up	for	six	 week 	 s 	 	.	it	's	got	little	 dress 	 ing 	 	rooms	and	cabanas	,	where	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	went	on	,	all	summer	long	.
now	,	 l 	 est 	 	you	think	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	 on 	 ly 	 	for	the	light	at	heart	,	or	just	 tempor 	 ary 	 	 install 	 ations 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	same	firm	 work 	 ing 	 	at	the	world	trade	center	,	 re 	 placing 	 	the	bridge	that	used	to	go	 a 	 cross 	 	west	street	,	that	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	pedestrian	 connect 	 ion 	 	between	the	city	of	new	york	and	the	redevelopment	of	the	west	side	.
