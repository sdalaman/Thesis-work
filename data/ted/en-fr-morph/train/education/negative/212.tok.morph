i	'm	going	to	talk	about	two	 st 	 ories 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
one	is	how	we	need	to	use	market	-	based	 pric 	 ing 	 	to	affect	demand	and	use	 wire 	 less 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	to	 dramat 	 ically 	 	 reduc 	 e 	 	our	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	in	the	 transport 	 ation 	 	sector	.
and	the	other	is	that	there	is	an	 in 	 credible 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	if	we	 choos 	 e 	 	the	right	 wire 	 less 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	;	how	we	can	generate	a	new	engine	for	economic	growth	and	 dramat 	 ically 	 	 reduc 	 e 	 	c	02	in	the	other	 sector 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 scar 	 ed 	 	.
we	need	to	 reduc 	 e 	 	c	02	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	in	ten	to	fifteen	 year 	 s 	 	by	80	percent	in	order	to	 a 	 vert 	 	 catastroph 	 ic 	 	 effect 	 s 	 	.
and	i	am	 astound 	 ed 	 	that	i	'm	 stand 	 ing 	 	here	to	tell	you	that	.
what	are	 catastroph 	 ic 	 	 effect 	 s 	 	?	a	three	degree	 cent 	 i 	 grade 	 	climate	change	rise	that	will	result	in	50	percent	species	 extinct 	 ion 	 	.
it	's	not	a	movie	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	real	life	.
and	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 worri 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	when	people	talk	about	 car 	 s 	 	--	which	i	know	 some 	 thing 	 	about	--	the	press	and	 politic 	 ians 	 	and	people	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	are	all	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	let	's	use	fuel	-	efficient	 car 	 s 	 	.	``
if	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	10	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	,	at	the	end	of	 th 	 is 	 	window	of	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	fuel	-	efficient	 car 	 s 	 	will	 reduc 	 e 	 	our	fossil	fuel	 need 	 s 	 	by	four	percent	.
that	is	not	 en 	 ough 	 	.
but	now	i	'll	talk	about	some	more	 pleas 	 ant 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
here	are	some	ways	that	we	can	make	some	 dramat 	 ic 	 	 change 	 s 	 	.
so	,	zipcar	is	a	company	that	i	 found 	 ed 	 	seven	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,
but	it	's	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	car	sharing	.
what	zipcar	 do 	 es 	 	is	we	park	 car 	 s 	 	 through 	 out 	 	dense	urban	 area 	 s 	 
for	 member 	 s 	 	to	 re 	 serve 	 	,	by	the	hour	and	by	the	day	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	using	 the 	 ir 	 	own	car	.
how	 do 	 es 	 	it	feel	to	be	a	person	using	a	zipcar	?
it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	i	pay	 on 	 ly 	 	for	what	i	need	.
all	 t 	 hose 	 	 hour 	 s 	 	when	a	car	is	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	 idl 	 e 	 	,	i	'm	not	 pay 	 ing 	 	for	it	.
it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	i	can	 choos 	 e 	 	a	car	 exact 	 ly 	 	for	that	 part 	 icular 	 	trip	.
so	,	here	's	a	woman	that	 re 	 serv 	 ed 	 	minimia	,	and	she	had	her	day	.
i	can	take	a	bmw	when	i	'm	 see 	 ing 	 	 client 	 s 	 	.
i	can	drive	my	toyota	element	when	i	'm	going	to	go	on	that	surfing	trip	.
and	the	other	 remark 	 able 	 	thing	is	it	's	,	i	think	,	the	highest	 stat 	 us 	 	of	car	 owner 	 ship 	 	.
not	 on 	 ly 	 	do	i	have	a	fleet	of	 car 	 s 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	to	me	in	seven	cities	around	the	world	that	i	can	have	at	my	beck	and	call	,	but	heaven	forbid	i	would	ever	maintain	or	deal	with	the	repair	or	have	 any 	 thing 	 	to	do	with	it	.
it	's	like	the	car	that	you	 al 	 ways 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	that	your	mom	 s 	 aid 	 	that	you	could	n't	have	.
i	get	all	the	good	stuff	and	 non 	 e 	 	of	the	bad	.
so	,	what	is	the	social	result	of	 th 	 is 	 	?
the	social	result	is	that	 to 	 day 	 	's	zipcar	 ha 	 s 	 	100,000	 member 	 s 	 	 driv 	 ing 	 	3,000	 car 	 s 	 	 park 	 ed 	 	in	3,000	 park 	 ing 	 	 space 	 s 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	 driv 	 ing 	 	12,000	 mile 	 s 	 	a	year	,	which	is	what	the	average	city	 d 	 well 	 er 	 	 do 	 es 	 	,	they	drive	500	 mile 	 s 	 	a	year	.	are	they	happy	?
the	company	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 doub 	 ling 	 	in	 s 	 ize 	 	ever	since	i	 found 	 ed 	 	it	,	or	 great 	 er 	 	.
people	 ador 	 e 	 	the	company	.	and	it	's	better	,
you	know	?	they	like	it	.
so	,	how	is	it	that	people	went	from	the	12,000	 mile 	 s 	 	a	year	to	500	 mile 	 s 	 	?
it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	it	's	eight	to	10	 dollar 	 s 	 	an	hour	and	65	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	day	.
if	i	'm	going	to	go	buy	some	ice	cream	,	do	i	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	 s 	 pend 	 	eight	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	go	buy	the	ice	cream	?	or	 may 	 be 	 	i	'll	do	 with 	 out 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	i	would	have	 b 	 ought 	 	the	ice	cream	when	i	did	some	other	 er 	 rand 	 	.	``
so	,	people	 re 	 ally 	 	respond	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	to	it	,	to	 price 	 s 	 	.
and	the	last	point	i	want	to	make	is	zipcar	would	never	be	possible	 with 	 out 	 	technology	.
it	 requir 	 ed 	 	that	it	was	 complete 	 ly 	 	trivial	:	that	it	 take 	 s 	 	30	 second 	 s 	 	to	 re 	 serve 	 	a	car	,	go	get	it	,	drive	it	.
and	for	me	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	service	 provide 	 r 	 	,	i	would	never	be	able	to	provide	you	a	car	for	an	hour	if	the	 trans 	 action 	 	cost	was	 any 	 thing 	 	.
so	,	 with 	 out 	 	these	 wire 	 less 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 con 	 cept 	 	,	could	never	happen	.
so	,	here	's	 an 	 other 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	company	is	goloco	--
i	'm	 launch 	 ing 	 	it	in	about	three	 week 	 s 	 	--
and	i	hope	to	do	for	 ride 	 sharing 	 	what	i	did	for	car	sharing	.
 th 	 is 	 	will	 app 	 ly 	 	to	people	 a 	 cross 	 	all	of	america	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	75	percent	of	the	 trip 	 s 	 	are	single	-	occupancy	 vehicle 	 s 	 	,
yet	12	percent	of	 trip 	 s 	 	to	work	are	 current 	 ly 	 	 car 	 pool 	 	.
and	i	think	that	we	can	 app 	 ly 	 	social	 network 	 s 	 	and	 on 	 line 	 	payment	 system 	 s 	 	to	 complete 	 ly 	 	change	how	people	feel	about	 ride 	 sharing 	 	and	make	that	trip	much	more	efficient	.
and	so	when	i	think	about	the	future	,	people	will	be	 think 	 ing 	 	that	sharing	the	ride	with	 some 	 one 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	great	social	event	out	of	 the 	 ir 	 	day	.
you	know	,	how	did	you	get	to	ted	?	you	went	with	other	tedsters	.
how	fabulous	.	why	would	you	ever	want	to	go	by	 your 	 self 	 	in	your	own	car	?
how	did	you	go	food	 shop 	 ping 	 	?	you	went	with	your	neighbor	,	what	a	great	social	time	.
you	know	it	's	going	to	 re 	 ally 	 	transform	how	we	feel	about	travel	,
and	it	will	 al 	 so 	 	,	i	think	,	enhance	our	 free 	 dom 	 	of	 mobil 	 ity 	 	.
where	can	i	go	 to 	 day 	 	and	who	can	i	do	it	with	?
 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	 type 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	will	look	at	and	feel	.
and	the	social	 benefit 	 s 	 	:
the	rate	of	single	-	occupancy	 vehicle 	 s 	 	is	,	i	told	you	,	75	percent	;
i	think	we	can	get	that	down	to	50	percent	.	the	demand	for	 park 	 ing 	 	,	of	course	,	is	down	,	 con 	 gest 	 ion 	 	and	the	co	2	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	.
one	last	piece	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	of	course	,	is	that	it	's	enabled	by	 wire 	 less 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	.
and	it	's	the	cost	of	 driv 	 ing 	 	that	's	making	people	want	to	be	able	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
the	average	american	 s 	 pend 	 s 	 	19	percent	of	 the 	 ir 	 	income	on	 the 	 ir 	 	car	,
and	there	's	a	pressure	for	them	to	 reduc 	 e 	 	that	cost	,	yet	they	have	no	 out 	 let 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
so	,	the	last	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	 con 	 gest 	 ion 	 	 pric 	 ing 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 famous 	 ly 	 	 d 	 one 	 	in	london	.
it	's	when	you	charge	a	 pre 	 mium 	 	for	people	to	drive	on	 con 	 gest 	 ed 	 	 road 	 s 	 	.
in	london	,	the	day	they	 turn 	 ed 	 	the	 con 	 gest 	 ion 	 	 pric 	 ing 	 	on	,	there	was	a	25	percent	 de 	 crease 	 	in	 con 	 gest 	 ion 	 	 over 	 night 	 	,
and	that	's	 persist 	 ed 	 	for	the	four	 year 	 s 	 	in	which	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 con 	 gest 	 ion 	 	 pric 	 ing 	 	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	do	people	like	the	 out 	 come 	 	?
ken	livingstone	was	 re 	 elect 	 ed 	 	.
so	 aga 	 in 	 	,	we	can	see	that	price	 play 	 s 	 	an	enormous	role	in	people	's	 will 	 ing 	 ness 	 	to	 reduc 	 e 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 driv 	 ing 	 	behavior	.
we	've	 triple 	 d 	 	the	 mile 	 s 	 	that	we	drive	since	1970	and	 double 	 d 	 	them	since	1982	.
there	's	a	huge	 s 	 lack 	 	in	that	system	;
with	the	right	 pric 	 ing 	 	we	can	 un 	 do 	 	that	.
 con 	 gest 	 ion 	 	 pric 	 ing 	 	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 discuss 	 ed 	 	in	every	major	city	around	the	world
and	is	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 wire 	 lessly 	 	enabled	.
you	 we 	 re 	 	n't	going	to	put	 toll 	 booth 	 s 	 	around	the	city	of	london	and	open	and	shut	 t 	 hose 	 	 gate 	 s 	 	.
and	what	 con 	 gest 	 ion 	 	 pric 	 ing 	 	is	is	that	it	's	a	technology	trial	and	a	 psycho 	 logical 	 	trial	for	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	road	 pric 	 ing 	 	.
and	road	 pric 	 ing 	 	is	where	we	're	all	going	to	have	to	go	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 to 	 day 	 	we	pay	for	our	maintenance	and	wear	and	tear	on	our	 car 	 s 	 	with	gas	 tax 	 es 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	we	get	our	 car 	 s 	 	more	fuel	-	efficient	,	that	's	going	to	be	 reduc 	 ing 	 	the	amount	of	revenue	that	you	get	off	of	 t 	 hose 	 	gas	 tax 	 es 	 	,
so	we	need	to	charge	people	by	the	mile	that	they	drive	.
 what 	 ever 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	with	 con 	 gest 	 ion 	 	 pric 	 ing 	 	and	 t 	 hose 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	will	be	 happen 	 ing 	 	with	road	 pric 	 ing 	 	.
why	do	we	travel	too	much	?
car	travel	is	 under 	 priced 	 	and	 there 	 fore 	 	we	over	-	 consum 	 ed 	 	.
we	need	to	put	 th 	 is 	 	better	market	 feed 	 back 	 	.	and	if	we	have	it	,	you	'll	decide	how	 man 	 y 	 	 mile 	 s 	 	to	drive	,	what	mode	of	travel	,	where	to	live	and	work	.
and	 wire 	 less 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	make	 th 	 is 	 	real	-	time	loop	possible	.
so	,	i	want	to	move	now	to	the	second	part	of	my	story	,	which	is	:	when	are	we	going	to	start	 do 	 ing 	 
 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 gest 	 ion 	 	 pric 	 ing 	 	?	road	 pric 	 ing 	 	is	coming	.
when	are	we	going	to	do	it	?	are	we	going	to	wait	10	to	15	 year 	 s 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	to	happen
or	are	we	going	to	 final 	 ly 	 	have	 th 	 is 	 	 politic 	 al 	 	will	to	make	it	happen	in	the	next	two	 year 	 s 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	going	to	say	,	that	is	going	to	be	the	tool	that	's	going	to	turn	our	 us 	 age 	 	 over 	 night 	 	.
and	what	kind	of	 wire 	 less 	 	technology	are	we	going	to	use	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	my	big	vision	.
there	is	a	tool	that	can	help	us	bridge	the	digital	divide	,	respond	to	 emerge 	 ncies 	 	,	get	traffic	moving	,	provide	a	new	engine	for	economic	growth	and	 dramat 	 ically 	 	 reduc 	 e 	 	co	2	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	in	every	sector	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	moment	from	``	the	graduate	.	``	do	you	remember	 th 	 is 	 	moment	?
you	 guy 	 s 	 	are	going	to	be	the	 hand 	 some 	 	young	guy

and	in	a	mesh	,	every	 de 	 vice 	 	 con 	 tribute 	 s 	 	to	and	 expand 	 s 	 	the	network	,

you	'll	be	 hear 	 ing 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	 to 	 day 	 	from	alan	kay	.
these	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	,	when	a	child	 open 	 s 	 	them	up	,	they	communicate	with	every	single	child	in	the	 class 	 room 	 	,	 with 	 in 	 	that	school	,	 with 	 in 	 	that	village	.
and	what	is	the	cost	of	that	communication	system	?
zero	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	month	.
here	's	 an 	 other 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	:	in	new	orleans	,	video	 camera 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	mesh	-	enabled	so	that	they	could	monitor	crime	in	the	 down 	 town 	 	french	quarter	.
when	the	hurricane	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	the	 on 	 ly 	 	communication	system	 stand 	 ing 	 	was	the	mesh	network	.

you	can	look	at	the	terminal	and	be	able	to	see	 precise 	 ly 	 	where	your	bus	is	on	the	street	and	when	it	's	coming	,	and	you	can	buy	your	 ticket 	 s 	 	in	real	time	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	all	mesh	-	enabled	.	 month 	 ly 	 	communication	cost	:	zero	.
so	,	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	of	mesh	 network 	 s 	 	:	you	can	have	these	 ver 	 y 	 	low	-	cost	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	.

you	can	keep	 subtract 	 ing 	 	them	--	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	there	's	some	,	we	can	still	communicate	.
they	're	 resili 	 ent 	 	;	 the 	 ir 	 	 red 	 un 	 d 	 ancy 	 	is	built	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	fabulous	 de 	 central 	 ized 	 	design	.

``	where	did	you	do	it	?	``	``	in	his	car	.	``
so	you	know	,	when	you	stick	 th 	 is 	 	idea	...	where	would	we	expect	me	,	 rob 	 in 	 	chase	,	to	be	 think 	 ing 	 	is	imagine	if	we	put	a	mesh	-	network	 de 	 vice 	 	in	every	single	car	 a 	 cross 	 	america	.
we	could	have	a	coast	-	to	-	coast	,	free	 wire 	 less 	 	communication	system	.
i	guess	i	just	want	you	to	think	about	that	.
and	why	is	 th 	 is 	 	going	to	happen	?	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	going	to	do	 con 	 gest 	 ion 	 	 pric 	 ing 	 	,
we	are	going	to	do	road	 toll 	 s 	 	,
gas	 tax 	 es 	 	are	going	to	 be 	 come 	 	road	 pric 	 ing 	 	.
these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	going	to	happen	.
what	's	the	 wire 	 less 	 	technology	we	're	going	to	use	?
 may 	 be 	 	we	should	use	a	good	one	.	when	are	we	going	to	do	it	?
 may 	 be 	 	we	should	n't	wait	for	the	10	or	15	 year 	 s 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	to	happen	.
we	should	pull	it	forward	.
so	,	i	'd	like	us	to	launch	the	 wire 	 less 	 	 inter 	 net 	 	 inter 	 state 	 	 wire 	 less 	 	mesh	system	,
and	 requir 	 e 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	network	be	 access 	 ible 	 	to	 every 	 one 	 	,	with	open	 standard 	 s 	 	.
right	now	in	the	 transport 	 ation 	 	sector	,	we	're	creating	these	 wire 	 less 	 	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	--
i	guess	you	 guy 	 s 	 	might	have	fast	pass	here	or	easy	lane	--
that	are	single	-	purpose	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	in	these	closed	 network 	 s 	 	.
what	is	the	point	?
we	're	 transfer 	 ring 	 	just	a	few	little	data	bits	when	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	road	 controll 	 ing 	 	,	road	 pric 	 ing 	 	.
we	have	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	excess	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	.
so	,	we	can	provide	the	 low 	 est 	 	-	cost	 mean 	 s 	 	of	going	 wire 	 less 	 	coast	-	to	-	coast	,	we	can	have	 resili 	 ent 	 	 nation 	 wide 	 	communication	 system 	 s 	 	,	we	have	a	new	tool	for	creating	efficiencies	in	all	 sector 	 s 	 	.
imagine	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	the	cost	of	 get 	 ting 	 	information	from	 any 	 where 	 	to	 any 	 where 	 	is	close	to	zero	.
what	you	can	do	with	that	tool	:	we	can	create	an	economic	engine	.
information	should	be	free	,	and	access	to	information	should	be	free	,	and	we	should	be	charging	people	for	carbon	.
i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	more	 power 	 ful 	 	tool	than	the	 inter 	 state 	 	 high 	 way 	 	act	,	and	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	and	world	changing	to	our	 eco 	 nomy 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 electr 	 ification 	 	.
and	if	i	had	my	 d 	 ruth 	 ers 	 	,	we	would	have	an	open	-	source	version	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	open	 standard 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	open	-	source	version	 mean 	 s 	 	that	it	could	be	--	if	we	did	a	 brilli 	 ant 	 	job	of	it	--	it	could	be	used	around	the	world	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
so	,	going	back	to	one	of	my	 ear 	 lier 	 	 thought 	 s 	 	.	imagine	if	every	one	of	these	 bus 	 es 	 	in	lagos	was	part	of	the	mesh	network	.
when	i	went	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	to	larry	 brilli 	 ant 	 	's	tedtalk	prize	--	his	fabulous	 network 	 s 	 	--
imagine	if	there	was	an	open	-	source	mesh	 communication 	 s 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	that	can	be	put	 in 	 to 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 network 	 s 	 	,	to	make	all	that	happen	.
and	we	can	be	 do 	 ing 	 	it	if	we	could	just	get	over	the	fact	that	 th 	 is 	 	little	slice	of	 thing 	 s 	 	is	going	to	be	for	free	.	we	could	make	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	on	top	of	it	,
but	 th 	 is 	 	one	 part 	 icular 	 	slice	of	 communication 	 s 	 	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	open	source	.
so	,	let	's	take	control	of	 th 	 is 	 	nightmare	:
implement	a	gas	tax	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	;
 transit 	 ion 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	nation	to	road	-	tolling	with	 th 	 is 	 	 wire 	 less 	 	mesh	;
 requir 	 e 	 	that	the	mesh	be	open	to	all	,	with	open	 standard 	 s 	 	;
and	,	of	course	,	use	mesh	 network 	 s 	 	.
thank	you	.
