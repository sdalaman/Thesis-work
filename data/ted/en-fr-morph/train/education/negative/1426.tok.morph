a	few	 month 	 s 	 	ago	the	 no 	 bel 	 	prize	in	physics	was	 a 	 ward 	 ed 	 	to	two	 team 	 s 	 	of	 astronomer 	 s 	 	for	a	 discover 	 y 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 hail 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	one	of	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	astronomical	 observ 	 ations 	 	ever	.
and	 to 	 day 	 	,	after	 brief 	 ly 	 	 de 	 s 	 crib 	 ing 	 	what	they	found	,	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	about	a	 high 	 ly 	 	controversial	 frame 	 work 	 	for	 explain 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 discover 	 y 	 	,	 name 	 ly 	 	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	that	way	beyond	the	earth	,	the	 milk 	 y 	 	way	and	other	 di 	 stant 	 	 galax 	 ies 	 	,	we	may	find	that	our	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	but	is	 in 	 stead 	 	part	of	a	vast	complex	of	 uni 	 verse 	 s 	 	that	we	call	the	 multi 	 verse 	 	.
now	the	idea	of	a	 multi 	 verse 	 	is	a	strange	one	.
i	mean	,	most	of	us	 we 	 re 	 	raised	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	the	word	``	 uni 	 verse 	 	``	 mean 	 s 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	.
and	i	say	most	of	us	with	forethought	,	 a 	 s 	 	my	four	-	year	-	old	daughter	 ha 	 s 	 	heard	me	speak	of	these	 idea 	 s 	 	since	she	was	born	.
and	last	year	i	was	 hold 	 ing 	 	her	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	sophia	,	i	love	you	more	than	 any 	 thing 	 	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.	``	and	she	 turn 	 ed 	 	to	me	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 d 	 addy 	 	,	 uni 	 verse 	 	or	 multi 	 verse 	 	?	``	but	 bar 	 ring 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	an	anomalous	 up 	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	,	it	is	strange	to	imagine	other	 realm 	 s 	 	 separat 	 e 	 	from	 our 	 s 	 	,	most	with	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	different	 feature 	 s 	 	,	that	would	 right 	 ly 	 	be	 call 	 ed 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	.
and	yet	,	 specul 	 ative 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	the	idea	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	is	,	i	aim	to	 con 	 vince 	 	you	that	there	's	reason	for	taking	it	 serious 	 ly 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	just	might	be	right	.
i	'm	going	to	tell	the	story	of	the	 multi 	 verse 	 	in	three	 part 	 s 	 	.
in	part	one	,	i	'm	going	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 no 	 bel 	 	prize	-	winning	 result 	 s 	 	and	to	 high 	 light 	 	a	 pro 	 found 	 	 myster 	 y 	 	which	 t 	 hose 	 	 result 	 s 	 	 reveal 	 ed 	 	.
in	part	two	,	i	'll	 off 	 er 	 	a	solution	to	that	 myster 	 y 	 	.
it	's	based	on	an	approach	 call 	 ed 	 	string	 theor 	 y 	 	,	and	that	's	where	the	idea	of	the	 multi 	 verse 	 	will	come	 in 	 to 	 	the	story	.
 final 	 ly 	 	,	in	part	three	,	i	'm	going	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	a	 cosmo 	 logical 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 infla 	 tion 	 	,	which	will	pull	all	the	 piece 	 s 	 	of	the	story	together	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	part	one	 start 	 s 	 	back	in	1929	when	the	great	astronomer	edwin	hubble	 real 	 ized 	 	that	the	 di 	 stant 	 	 galax 	 ies 	 	 we 	 re 	 	all	 rush 	 ing 	 	away	from	us	,	 establish 	 ing 	 	that	space	 it 	 self 	 	is	 stretch 	 ing 	 	,	it	's	 expand 	 ing 	 	.	now	 th 	 is 	 	was	 revolution 	 ary 	 	.
the	 prevail 	 ing 	 	 wis 	 dom 	 	was	that	on	the	largest	of	 scale 	 s 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	was	static	.
but	even	so	,	there	was	one	thing	that	 every 	 one 	 	was	certain	of	:	the	expansion	must	be	 s 	 low 	 ing 	 	down	.
that	,	much	 a 	 s 	 	the	 gravit 	 ation 	 al 	 	pull	of	the	earth	 s 	 low 	 s 	 	the	 a 	 s 	 cent 	 	of	an	apple	 to 	 s 	 s 	 ed 	 	 up 	 ward 	 	,	the	 gravit 	 ation 	 al 	 	pull	of	each	 galax 	 y 	 	on	every	other	must	be	 s 	 low 	 ing 	 	the	expansion	of	space	.
now	let	's	fast	-	forward	to	the	1990s	when	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 team 	 s 	 	of	 astronomer 	 s 	 	i	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	at	the	 out 	 set 	 	 we 	 re 	 	inspired	by	 th 	 is 	 	 reason 	 ing 	 	to	measure	the	rate	at	which	the	expansion	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 low 	 ing 	 	.
and	they	did	 th 	 is 	 	by	 pain 	 s 	 taking 	 	 observ 	 ations 	 	of	 nume 	 r 	 ous 	 	 di 	 stant 	 	 galax 	 ies 	 	,	 allow 	 ing 	 	them	to	chart	how	the	expansion	rate	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	over	time	.
here	's	the	surprise	:	they	found	that	the	expansion	is	not	 s 	 low 	 ing 	 	down	.
 in 	 stead 	 	they	found	that	it	's	 speed 	 ing 	 	up	,	going	 fast 	 er 	 	and	 fast 	 er 	 	.
that	's	like	 to 	 s 	 s 	 ing 	 	an	apple	 up 	 ward 	 	and	it	 go 	 es 	 	up	 fast 	 er 	 	and	 fast 	 er 	 	.
now	if	you	saw	an	apple	do	that	,	you	'd	want	to	know	why	.
what	's	 push 	 ing 	 	on	it	?
 similar 	 ly 	 	,	the	 astronomer 	 s 	 	'	 result 	 s 	 	are	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	well	-	 de 	 serv 	 ing 	 	of	the	 no 	 bel 	 	prize	,	but	they	raised	an	 analog 	 ous 	 	question	.
what	force	is	 driv 	 ing 	 	all	 galax 	 ies 	 	to	rush	away	from	every	other	at	an	ever	-	quickening	speed	?
well	the	most	promising	answer	 come 	 s 	 	from	an	old	idea	of	einstein	's	.
you	see	,	we	are	all	used	to	 gravit 	 y 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	a	force	that	 do 	 es 	 	one	thing	,	 pull 	 s 	 	 object 	 s 	 	together	.
but	in	einstein	's	 theor 	 y 	 	of	 gravit 	 y 	 	,	his	general	 theor 	 y 	 	of	 relat 	 ivity 	 	,	 gravit 	 y 	 	can	 al 	 so 	 	push	 thing 	 s 	 	 a 	 part 	 	.
how	?	well	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	einstein	's	math	,	if	space	is	 uniform 	 ly 	 	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	an	 in 	 visible 	 	energy	,	sort	of	like	a	uniform	,	 in 	 visible 	 	 mis 	 t 	 	,	then	the	 gravit 	 y 	 	generated	by	that	 mis 	 t 	 	would	be	repulsive	,	repulsive	 gravit 	 y 	 	,	which	is	just	what	we	need	to	explain	the	 observ 	 ations 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	repulsive	 gravit 	 y 	 	of	an	 in 	 visible 	 	energy	in	space	--	we	now	call	it	dark	energy	,	but	i	've	made	it	smokey	white	here	so	you	can	see	it	--	 it 	 s 	 	repulsive	 gravit 	 y 	 	would	cause	each	 galax 	 y 	 	to	push	against	every	other	,	 driv 	 ing 	 	expansion	to	speed	up	,	not	 s 	 low 	 	down	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 explan 	 ation 	 	 represent 	 s 	 	great	progress	.
but	i	 promise 	 d 	 	you	a	 myster 	 y 	 	here	in	part	one	.
here	it	is	.
when	the	 astronomer 	 s 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	out	how	much	of	 th 	 is 	 	dark	energy	must	be	 in 	 fusing 	 	space	to	account	for	the	 cosm 	 ic 	 	speed	up	,	look	at	what	they	found	.
 th 	 is 	 	number	is	small	.
 express 	 ed 	 	in	the	relevant	unit	,	it	is	 spectacular 	 ly 	 	small	.
and	the	 myster 	 y 	 	is	to	explain	 th 	 is 	 	peculiar	number	.
we	want	 th 	 is 	 	number	to	emerge	from	the	 law 	 s 	 	of	physics	,	but	so	far	no	one	 ha 	 s 	 	found	a	way	to	do	that	.
now	you	might	wonder	,	should	you	care	?
 may 	 be 	 	 explain 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	number	is	just	a	technical	issue	,	a	technical	detail	of	interest	to	 expert 	 s 	 	,	but	of	no	relevance	to	 any 	 body 	 	else	.
well	it	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	is	a	technical	detail	,	but	some	 detail 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	matter	.
some	 detail 	 s 	 	provide	 window 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 un 	 chart 	 ed 	 	 realm 	 s 	 	of	 re 	 ality 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	peculiar	number	may	be	 do 	 ing 	 	just	that	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	 on 	 ly 	 	approach	that	's	so	far	made	headway	to	explain	it	 invoke 	 s 	 	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	other	 uni 	 verse 	 s 	 	--	an	idea	that	 natural 	 ly 	 	 emerge 	 s 	 	from	string	 theor 	 y 	 	,	which	 take 	 s 	 	me	to	part	two	:	string	 theor 	 y 	 	.
so	hold	the	 myster 	 y 	 	of	the	dark	energy	in	the	back	of	your	mind	 a 	 s 	 	i	now	go	on	to	tell	you	three	key	 thing 	 s 	 	about	string	 theor 	 y 	 	.
first	off	,	what	is	it	?
well	it	's	an	approach	to	 real 	 ize 	 	einstein	's	dream	of	a	 un 	 ified 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	of	physics	,	a	single	overarching	 frame 	 work 	 	that	would	be	able	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	all	the	 force 	 s 	 	at	work	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
and	the	central	idea	of	string	 theor 	 y 	 	is	 quit 	 e 	 	 straight 	 forward 	 	.
it	 say 	 s 	 	that	if	you	examine	any	piece	of	matter	ever	more	 fine 	 ly 	 	,	at	first	you	'll	find	 molecule 	 s 	 	and	then	you	'll	find	 atom 	 s 	 	and	 sub 	 atomic 	 	 particle 	 s 	 	.
but	the	 theor 	 y 	 	 say 	 s 	 	that	if	you	could	 prob 	 e 	 	 small 	 er 	 	,	much	 small 	 er 	 	than	we	can	with	 exist 	 ing 	 	technology	,	you	'd	find	 some 	 thing 	 	else	 in 	 side 	 	these	 particle 	 s 	 	--	a	little	 tin 	 y 	 	 vib 	 rating 	 	 fi 	 lament 	 	of	energy	,	a	little	 tin 	 y 	 	 vib 	 rating 	 	string	.
and	just	like	the	 string 	 s 	 	on	a	 viol 	 in 	 	,	they	can	 vib 	 rate 	 	in	different	 pattern 	 s 	 	producing	different	musical	 note 	 s 	 	.
these	little	fundamental	 string 	 s 	 	,	when	they	 vib 	 rate 	 	in	different	 pattern 	 s 	 	,	they	produce	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 particle 	 s 	 	--	so	 electron 	 s 	 	,	 quar 	 k 	 s 	 	,	 neutrino 	 s 	 	,	 photo 	 ns 	 	,	all	other	 particle 	 s 	 	would	be	 unit 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	single	 frame 	 work 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	they	would	all	arise	from	 vib 	 rating 	 	 string 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	 compel 	 ling 	 	picture	,	a	kind	of	 cosm 	 ic 	 	 sym 	 phony 	 	,	where	all	the	 rich 	 ness 	 	that	we	see	in	the	world	around	us	 emerge 	 s 	 	from	the	music	that	these	little	,	 tin 	 y 	 	 string 	 s 	 	can	play	.
but	there	's	a	cost	to	 th 	 is 	 	elegant	 un 	 ification 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 year 	 s 	 	of	research	have	 show 	 n 	 	that	the	math	of	string	 theor 	 y 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	work	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	internal	 in 	 consist 	 encies 	 	,	 un 	 less 	 	we	allow	for	 some 	 thing 	 	 who 	 lly 	 	 un 	 familiar 	 	--	extra	 dimension 	 s 	 	of	space	.
that	is	,	we	all	know	about	the	usual	three	 dimension 	 s 	 	of	space	.
and	you	can	think	about	 t 	 hose 	 	 a 	 s 	 	height	,	width	and	depth	.
but	string	 theor 	 y 	 	 say 	 s 	 	that	,	on	 fantastic 	 ally 	 	small	 scale 	 s 	 	,	there	are	 add 	 ition 	 al 	 	 dimension 	 s 	 	 crumple 	 d 	 	to	a	 tin 	 y 	 	 s 	 ize 	 	so	small	that	we	have	not	 detect 	 ed 	 	them	.
but	even	 th 	 ough 	 	the	 dimension 	 s 	 	are	 hid 	 den 	 	,	they	would	have	an	impact	on	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	can	 observ 	 e 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	shape	of	the	extra	 dimension 	 s 	 	constrains	how	the	 string 	 s 	 	can	 vib 	 rate 	 	.
and	in	string	 theor 	 y 	 	,	vibration	 determine 	 s 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	.
so	particle	 masse 	 s 	 	,	the	 strength 	 s 	 	of	 force 	 s 	 	,	and	most	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	the	amount	of	dark	energy	would	be	 determine 	 d 	 	by	the	shape	of	the	extra	 dimension 	 s 	 	.
so	if	we	 k 	 new 	 	the	shape	of	the	extra	 dimension 	 s 	 	,	we	should	be	able	to	 calcul 	 ate 	 	these	 feature 	 s 	 	,	 calcul 	 ate 	 	the	amount	of	dark	energy	.
the	 challeng 	 e 	 	is	we	do	n't	know	the	shape	of	the	extra	 dimension 	 s 	 	.
all	we	have	is	a	list	of	 candid 	 ate 	 	 shape 	 s 	 	 allow 	 ed 	 	by	the	math	.
now	when	these	 idea 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	first	 develop 	 ed 	 	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	about	five	different	 candid 	 ate 	 	 shape 	 s 	 	,	so	you	can	imagine	 analyz 	 ing 	 	them	one	-	by	-	one	to	determine	if	any	yield	the	physical	 feature 	 s 	 	we	 observ 	 e 	 	.
but	over	time	the	list	grew	 a 	 s 	 	 research 	 ers 	 	found	other	 candid 	 ate 	 	 shape 	 s 	 	.
from	five	,	the	number	grew	 in 	 to 	 	the	 hundred 	 s 	 	and	then	the	 thousand 	 s 	 	--	a	large	,	but	still	 manage 	 able 	 	,	 collect 	 ion 	 	to	 analyz 	 e 	 	,	since	after	all	,	graduate	 student 	 s 	 	need	 some 	 thing 	 	to	do	.
but	then	the	list	 continu 	 ed 	 	to	grow	 in 	 to 	 	the	 million 	 s 	 	and	the	 billion 	 s 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
the	list	of	 candid 	 ate 	 	 shape 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 soar 	 ed 	 	to	about	10	to	the	500	.
so	,	what	to	do	?
well	some	 research 	 ers 	 	lost	heart	,	 con 	 clud 	 ing 	 	that	was	so	 man 	 y 	 	 candid 	 ate 	 	 shape 	 s 	 	for	the	extra	 dimension 	 s 	 	,	each	giving	rise	to	different	physical	 feature 	 s 	 	,	string	 theor 	 y 	 	would	never	make	definitive	,	 test 	 able 	 	 predict 	 ions 	 	.
but	 other 	 s 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	issue	on	 it 	 s 	 	head	,	taking	us	to	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	a	 multi 	 verse 	 	.
here	's	the	idea	.
 may 	 be 	 	each	of	these	 shape 	 s 	 	is	on	an	equal	 foot 	 ing 	 	with	every	other	.
each	is	 a 	 s 	 	real	 a 	 s 	 	every	other	,	in	the	sense	that	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 s 	 	,	each	with	a	different	shape	,	for	the	extra	 dimension 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	radical	proposal	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 pro 	 found 	 	impact	on	 th 	 is 	 	 myster 	 y 	 	:	the	amount	of	dark	energy	 reveal 	 ed 	 	by	the	 no 	 bel 	 	prize	-	winning	 result 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	you	see	,	if	there	are	other	 uni 	 verse 	 s 	 	,	and	if	 t 	 hose 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 s 	 	each	have	,	say	,	a	different	shape	for	the	extra	 dimension 	 s 	 	,	then	the	physical	 feature 	 s 	 	of	each	 uni 	 verse 	 	will	be	different	,	and	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	the	amount	of	dark	energy	in	each	 uni 	 verse 	 	will	be	different	.
which	 mean 	 s 	 	that	the	 myster 	 y 	 	of	 explain 	 ing 	 	the	amount	of	dark	energy	we	've	now	 measur 	 ed 	 	would	take	on	a	 who 	 lly 	 	different	character	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 text 	 	,	the	 law 	 s 	 	of	physics	ca	n't	explain	one	number	for	the	dark	energy	 be 	 cause 	 	there	is	n't	just	one	number	,	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 number 	 s 	 	.
which	 mean 	 s 	 	we	have	 be 	 en 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	the	wrong	question	.
it	's	that	the	right	question	to	ask	is	,	why	do	we	 human 	 s 	 	find	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	a	 uni 	 verse 	 	with	a	 part 	 icular 	 	amount	of	dark	energy	we	've	 measur 	 ed 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	any	of	the	other	 possibil 	 ities 	 	and	that	's	a	question	on	which	we	can	make	headway	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 s 	 	that	have	much	more	dark	energy	than	 our 	 s 	 	,	 when 	 ever 	 	matter	tries	to	 c 	 lump 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 galax 	 ies 	 	,	the	repulsive	push	of	the	dark	energy	is	so	strong	that	it	 blow 	 s 	 	the	 c 	 lump 	 	 a 	 part 	 	and	 galax 	 ies 	 	do	n't	form	.	and	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 s 	 	that	have	much	less	dark	energy	,	well	they	collapse	back	on	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	so	 quick 	 ly 	 	that	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 galax 	 ies 	 	do	n't	form	.	and	 with 	 out 	 	 galax 	 ies 	 	,	there	are	no	 star 	 s 	 	,	no	 planet 	 s 	 	and	no	chance	for	our	form	of	life	to	exist	in	 t 	 hose 	 	other	 uni 	 verse 	 s 	 	.
so	we	find	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	a	 uni 	 verse 	 	with	the	 part 	 icular 	 	amount	of	dark	energy	we	've	 measur 	 ed 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	our	 uni 	 verse 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	hospitable	to	our	form	of	life	.
and	that	would	be	that	.
 myster 	 y 	 	 solve 	 d 	 	,	 multi 	 verse 	 	found	.
now	some	find	 th 	 is 	 	 explan 	 ation 	 	unsatisfying	.
we	're	used	to	physics	giving	us	definitive	 explan 	 ations 	 	for	the	 feature 	 s 	 	we	 observ 	 e 	 	.
but	the	point	is	,	if	the	feature	you	're	 observ 	 ing 	 	can	and	 do 	 es 	 	take	on	a	wide	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	different	 value 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 wide 	 r 	 	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	of	 re 	 ality 	 	,	then	 think 	 ing 	 	one	 explan 	 ation 	 	for	a	 part 	 icular 	 	value	is	 simpl 	 y 	 	 mis 	 guide 	 d 	 	.
an	early	 ex 	 ample 	 	 come 	 s 	 	from	the	great	astronomer	johannes	kepler	who	was	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	 understand 	 ing 	 	a	different	number	--	why	the	 s 	 un 	 	is	93	million	 mile 	 s 	 	away	from	the	earth	.
and	he	 work 	 ed 	 	for	 decade 	 s 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	explain	 th 	 is 	 	number	,	but	he	never	 succeed 	 ed 	 	,	and	we	know	why	.
kepler	was	 ask 	 ing 	 	the	wrong	question	.
we	now	know	that	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 planet 	 s 	 	at	a	wide	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	different	 distance 	 s 	 	from	 the 	 ir 	 	host	 star 	 s 	 	.
so	 hop 	 ing 	 	that	the	 law 	 s 	 	of	physics	will	explain	one	 part 	 icular 	 	number	,	93	million	 mile 	 s 	 	,	well	that	is	 simpl 	 y 	 	 wrong 	 headed 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	the	right	question	to	ask	is	,	why	do	we	 human 	 s 	 	find	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	on	a	planet	at	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	distance	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	any	of	the	other	 possibil 	 ities 	 	?
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	that	's	a	question	we	can	answer	.
 t 	 hose 	 	 planet 	 s 	 	which	are	much	 close 	 r 	 	to	a	star	like	the	 s 	 un 	 	would	be	so	hot	that	our	form	of	life	would	n't	exist	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	 planet 	 s 	 	that	are	much	 far 	 ther 	 	away	from	the	star	,	well	they	're	so	cold	that	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	our	form	of	life	would	not	take	hold	.
so	we	find	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	on	a	planet	at	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	distance	 simpl 	 y 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 yield 	 s 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	vital	to	our	form	of	life	.
and	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	 planet 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 distance 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 clear 	 ly 	 	is	the	right	kind	of	 reason 	 ing 	 	.
the	point	is	,	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	 uni 	 verse 	 s 	 	and	the	dark	energy	that	they	contain	,	it	may	 al 	 so 	 	be	the	right	kind	of	 reason 	 ing 	 	.
one	key	 differ 	 ence 	 	,	of	course	,	is	we	know	that	there	are	other	 planet 	 s 	 	out	there	,	but	so	far	i	've	 on 	 ly 	 	 specul 	 ated 	 	on	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	that	there	might	be	other	 uni 	 verse 	 s 	 	.
so	to	pull	it	all	together	,	we	need	a	 mechan 	 ism 	 	that	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	generate	other	 uni 	 verse 	 s 	 	.
and	that	 take 	 s 	 	me	to	my	final	part	,	part	three	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 mechan 	 ism 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	found	by	 cosmo 	 logists 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	the	big	bang	.
you	see	,	when	we	speak	of	the	big	bang	,	we	often	have	an	image	of	a	kind	of	 cosm 	 ic 	 	explosion	that	 create 	 d 	 	our	 uni 	 verse 	 	and	set	space	 rush 	 ing 	 	 out 	 ward 	 	.
but	there	's	a	little	secret	.
the	big	bang	 leav 	 es 	 	out	 some 	 thing 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	the	bang	.
it	 tell 	 s 	 	us	how	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	after	the	bang	,	but	 give 	 s 	 	us	no	 in 	 sight 	 	 in 	 to 	 	what	would	have	powered	the	bang	 it 	 self 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	gap	was	 final 	 ly 	 	 fill 	 ed 	 	by	an	 enhance 	 d 	 	version	of	the	big	bang	 theor 	 y 	 	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	 infla 	 tion 	 ary 	 	 cosmo 	 logy 	 	,	which	identified	a	 part 	 icular 	 	kind	of	fuel	that	would	 natural 	 ly 	 	generate	an	 out 	 ward 	 	rush	of	space	.
the	fuel	is	based	on	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	a	 quant 	 um 	 	field	,	but	the	 on 	 ly 	 	detail	that	 matter 	 s 	 	for	us	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	fuel	 prove 	 s 	 	to	be	so	efficient	that	it	's	 virtual 	 ly 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	to	use	it	all	up	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	in	the	 infla 	 tion 	 ary 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	,	the	big	bang	giving	rise	to	our	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	 like 	 ly 	 	not	a	one	-	time	event	.
 in 	 stead 	 	the	fuel	not	 on 	 ly 	 	generated	our	big	bang	,	but	it	would	 al 	 so 	 	generate	 count 	 less 	 	other	big	 bang 	 s 	 	,	each	giving	rise	to	 it 	 s 	 	own	 separat 	 e 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	with	our	 uni 	 verse 	 	 be 	 coming 	 	but	one	bubble	in	a	grand	 cosm 	 ic 	 	bubble	bath	of	 uni 	 verse 	 s 	 	.
and	now	,	when	we	meld	 th 	 is 	 	with	string	 theor 	 y 	 	,	here	's	the	picture	we	're	led	to	.
each	of	these	 uni 	 verse 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	extra	 dimension 	 s 	 	.
the	extra	 dimension 	 s 	 	take	on	a	wide	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	different	 shape 	 s 	 	.
the	different	 shape 	 s 	 	yield	different	physical	 feature 	 s 	 	.
and	we	find	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	one	 uni 	 verse 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 an 	 other 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	in	our	 uni 	 verse 	 	that	the	physical	 feature 	 s 	 	,	like	the	amount	of	dark	energy	,	are	right	for	our	form	of	life	to	take	hold	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 compel 	 ling 	 	but	 high 	 ly 	 	controversial	picture	of	the	 wide 	 r 	 	 cosmo 	 s 	 	that	cutting	-	edge	 observ 	 ation 	 	and	 theor 	 y 	 	have	now	led	us	to	 serious 	 ly 	 	consider	.
one	big	 remain 	 ing 	 	question	,	of	course	,	is	,	could	we	ever	confirm	the	 exist 	 ence 	 	of	other	 uni 	 verse 	 s 	 	?
well	let	me	 de 	 scribe 	 	one	way	that	might	one	day	happen	.
the	 infla 	 tion 	 ary 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	strong	 observ 	 ation 	 al 	 	support	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	 theor 	 y 	 	 predict 	 s 	 	that	the	big	bang	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	so	 intens 	 e 	 	that	 a 	 s 	 	space	 rapid 	 ly 	 	 expand 	 ed 	 	,	 tin 	 y 	 	 quant 	 um 	 	jitters	from	the	micro	world	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	 stretch 	 ed 	 	out	to	the	macro	world	,	 yield 	 ing 	 	a	 distinct 	 ive 	 	 finger 	 print 	 	,	a	pattern	of	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 hot 	 ter 	 	 spot 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 cold 	 er 	 	 spot 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 cross 	 	space	,	which	 power 	 ful 	 	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	have	now	 observ 	 ed 	 	.
going	further	,	if	there	are	other	 uni 	 verse 	 s 	 	,	the	 theor 	 y 	 	 predict 	 s 	 	that	every	so	often	 t 	 hose 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 s 	 	can	collide	.
and	if	our	 uni 	 verse 	 	got	hit	by	 an 	 other 	 	,	that	collision	would	generate	an	 add 	 ition 	 al 	 	subtle	pattern	of	temperature	 vari 	 ations 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	space	that	we	might	one	day	and	so	 ex 	 otic 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	picture	is	,	it	may	one	day	be	 ground 	 ed 	 	in	 observ 	 ations 	 	,	 establish 	 ing 	 	the	 exist 	 ence 	 	of	other	 uni 	 verse 	 s 	 	.
i	'll	conclude	with	a	 s 	 tri 	 king 	 	 implic 	 ation 	 	of	all	these	 idea 	 s 	 	for	the	 ver 	 y 	 	far	future	.
you	see	,	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	our	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	not	static	,	that	space	is	 expand 	 ing 	 	,	that	that	expansion	is	 speed 	 ing 	 	up	and	that	there	might	be	other	 uni 	 verse 	 s 	 	all	by	 care 	 fully 	 	 exa 	 min 	 ing 	 	faint	 pin 	 point 	 s 	 	of	 star 	 light 	 	coming	to	us	from	 di 	 stant 	 	 galax 	 ies 	 	.
but	 be 	 cause 	 	the	expansion	is	 speed 	 ing 	 	up	,	in	the	 ver 	 y 	 	far	future	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 galax 	 ies 	 	will	rush	away	so	far	and	so	fast	that	we	wo	n't	be	able	to	see	them	--	not	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 techno 	 logical 	 	 limit 	 ations 	 	,	but	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 law 	 s 	 	of	physics	.
the	light	 t 	 hose 	 	 galax 	 ies 	 	emit	,	even	 travel 	 ing 	 	at	the	 fast 	 est 	 	speed	,	the	speed	of	light	,	will	not	be	able	to	 over 	 come 	 	the	ever	-	 widen 	 ing 	 	 gu 	 lf 	 	between	us	.
so	 astronomer 	 s 	 	in	the	far	future	looking	out	 in 	 to 	 	deep	space	will	see	 noth 	 ing 	 	but	an	 end 	 less 	 	stretch	of	static	,	inky	,	black	 still 	 ness 	 	.
and	they	will	conclude	that	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	static	and	 un 	 changing 	 	and	 populate 	 d 	 	by	a	single	central	 oa 	 sis 	 	of	matter	that	they	inhabit	--	a	picture	of	the	 cosmo 	 s 	 	that	we	 definitive 	 ly 	 	know	to	be	wrong	.
now	 may 	 be 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	future	 astronomer 	 s 	 	will	have	 record 	 s 	 	 hand 	 ed 	 	down	from	an	 ear 	 lier 	 	era	,	like	 our 	 s 	 	,	attesting	to	an	 expand 	 ing 	 	 cosmo 	 s 	 	 tee 	 ming 	 	with	 galax 	 ies 	 	.
but	would	 t 	 hose 	 	future	 astronomer 	 s 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	ancient	knowledge	?
or	would	they	 believ 	 e 	 	in	the	black	,	static	empty	 uni 	 verse 	 	that	 the 	 ir 	 	own	state	-	of	-	the	-	art	 observ 	 ations 	 	reveal	?
i	suspect	the	 lat 	 ter 	 	.
which	 mean 	 s 	 	that	we	are	living	through	a	 remark 	 ably 	 	 privilege 	 d 	 	era	when	certain	deep	 truth 	 s 	 	about	the	 cosmo 	 s 	 	are	still	 with 	 in 	 	reach	of	the	human	spirit	of	exploration	.
it	 appear 	 s 	 	that	it	may	not	 al 	 ways 	 	be	that	way	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 to 	 day 	 	's	 astronomer 	 s 	 	,	by	 turn 	 ing 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	to	the	sky	,	have	 capture 	 d 	 	a	 hand 	 ful 	 	of	starkly	 inform 	 ative 	 	 photo 	 ns 	 	--	a	kind	of	 cosm 	 ic 	 	 tele 	 gram 	 	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	in	transit	.
and	the	 mess 	 age 	 	echoing	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 age 	 s 	 	is	clear	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	nature	 guard 	 s 	 	her	 secret 	 s 	 	with	the	unbreakable	grip	of	physical	law	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	the	true	nature	of	 re 	 ality 	 	 beck 	 on 	 s 	 	from	just	beyond	the	horizon	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
chris	anderson	:	brian	,	thank	you	.
the	range	of	 idea 	 s 	 	you	've	just	spoken	about	are	 dizzy 	 ing 	 	,	 exhila 	 rating 	 	,	 in 	 credible 	 	.
how	do	you	think	of	where	 cosmo 	 logy 	 	is	now	,	in	a	sort	of	 historic 	 al 	 	side	?
are	we	in	the	middle	of	 some 	 thing 	 	 un 	 usual 	 	 historic 	 ally 	 	in	your	opinion	?
bg	:	well	it	's	hard	to	say	.
when	we	learn	that	 astronomer 	 s 	 	of	the	far	future	may	not	have	 en 	 ough 	 	information	to	figure	 thing 	 s 	 	out	,	the	natural	question	is	,	 may 	 be 	 	we	're	 al 	 ready 	 	in	that	position	and	certain	deep	,	critical	 feature 	 s 	 	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	have	 es 	 cap 	 ed 	 	our	ability	to	understand	 be 	 cause 	 	of	how	 cosmo 	 logy 	 	 evolve 	 s 	 	.
so	from	that	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	we	will	 al 	 ways 	 	be	 ask 	 ing 	 	 question 	 s 	 	and	never	be	able	to	fully	answer	them	.
on	the	other	hand	,	we	now	can	understand	how	old	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	.
we	can	understand	how	to	understand	the	data	from	the	 micro 	 wave 	 	 back 	 ground 	 	 radi 	 ation 	 	that	was	set	down	13.72	billion	 year 	 s 	 	ago	--	and	yet	,	we	can	do	 calcul 	 ations 	 	 to 	 day 	 	to	predict	how	it	will	look	and	it	 match 	 es 	 	.
holy	cow	!	that	's	just	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
so	on	the	one	hand	,	it	's	just	 in 	 credible 	 	where	we	've	gotten	,	but	who	 know 	 s 	 	what	sort	of	 block 	 s 	 	we	may	find	in	the	future	.
ca	:	you	're	going	to	be	around	for	the	next	few	 day 	 s 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	some	of	these	 conversation 	 s 	 	can	 continu 	 e 	 	.
