it	's	 wonder 	 ful 	 	to	be	back	.
i	love	 th 	 is 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 gather 	 ing 	 	.
and	you	must	be	 wonder 	 ing 	 	,	``	what	on	earth	?
have	they	put	up	the	wrong	slide	?	``
no	,	no	.
look	at	 th 	 is 	 	 magnific 	 ent 	 	beast	and	ask	the	question	--	who	designed	it	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	ted	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	technology	,	 entertain 	 ment 	 	,	design	and	there	's	a	 dai 	 ry 	 	cow	.
it	's	a	 quit 	 e 	 	 wonder 	 fully 	 	designed	animal	.
and	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	,	how	do	i	 introduc 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	?
and	i	thought	,	well	,	 may 	 be 	 	that	old	 dog 	 ger 	 el 	 	by	joyce	kilmer	,	you	know	:	``	 poem 	 s 	 	are	made	by	 fool 	 s 	 	like	me	,	but	 on 	 ly 	 	god	can	make	a	tree	.	``
and	you	might	say	,	``	well	,	god	designed	the	cow	.	``
but	,	of	course	,	god	got	a	lot	of	help	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 ance 	 s 	 tor 	 	of	cattle	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	oryx	.
and	it	was	designed	by	natural	 s 	 election 	 	,	the	process	of	natural	 s 	 election 	 	,	over	 man 	 y 	 	 million 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	then	it	 be 	 came 	 	 domestic 	 ated 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	 be 	 came 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 steward 	 s 	 	,
and	,	 with 	 out 	 	even	 know 	 ing 	 	what	they	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	,	they	 gradu 	 ally 	 	 re 	 designed 	 	it	and	 re 	 designed 	 	it	and	 re 	 designed 	 	it	.
and	then	,	more	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	they	 re 	 ally 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	to	do	sort	of	reverse	 engineer 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	beast	and	figure	out	just	what	the	 part 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	,	how	they	 work 	 ed 	 	and	how	they	might	be	 optimize 	 d 	 	--	how	they	might	be	made	better	.
now	why	am	i	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 cow 	 s 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	i	want	to	say	that	much	the	same	thing	is	true	of	 relig 	 ions 	 	.
 relig 	 ions 	 	are	natural	 phenomen 	 a 	 	.
they	're	just	 a 	 s 	 	natural	 a 	 s 	 	 cow 	 s 	 	.
they	have	 evolv 	 ed 	 	over	millennia	.
they	have	a	 bio 	 logical 	 	base	,	just	like	the	oryx	.
they	have	 be 	 come 	 	 domestic 	 ated 	 	,	and	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 re 	 design 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 relig 	 ions 	 	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	ted	,	and	i	want	to	talk	about	design	.
 be 	 cause 	 	what	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	for	the	last	four	 year 	 s 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	since	the	first	time	you	saw	me	--	some	of	you	saw	me	at	ted	when	i	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	and	in	the	last	four	 year 	 s 	 	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	just	about	non	-	stop	on	 th 	 is 	 	 top 	 ic 	 	.
and	you	might	say	it	's	about	the	reverse	 engineer 	 ing 	 	of	 relig 	 ions 	 	.	now	that	 ver 	 y 	 	idea	,	i	think	,	 strike 	 s 	 	terror	in	 man 	 y 	 	people	,	or	anger	,	or	 anxie 	 ty 	 	of	one	sort	or	 an 	 other 	 	.
and	that	is	the	spell	that	i	want	to	break	.
i	want	to	say	,	no	,	 relig 	 ions 	 	are	an	 import 	 ant 	 	natural	 phenomen 	 on 	 	.
we	should	 stud 	 y 	 	them	with	the	same	 intens 	 ity 	 	that	we	 stud 	 y 	 	all	the	other	 import 	 ant 	 	natural	 phenomen 	 a 	 	,	like	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	heard	so	 eloquent 	 ly 	 	last	night	from	al	gore	.
 to 	 day 	 	's	 relig 	 ions 	 	are	 brilli 	 ant 	 ly 	 	designed	--	 brilli 	 ant 	 ly 	 	designed	.
they	're	 immense 	 ly 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	social	 institution 	 s 	 	and	 man 	 y 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 feature 	 s 	 	can	be	 trac 	 ed 	 	back	to	 ear 	 lier 	 	 feature 	 s 	 	that	we	can	 re 	 ally 	 	make	sense	of	by	reverse	 engineer 	 ing 	 	.
and	,	 a 	 s 	 	with	the	cow	,	there	's	a	 mix 	 ture 	 	of	 evolution 	 ary 	 	design	,	designed	by	natural	 s 	 election 	 	 it 	 self 	 	,	and	intelligent	design	--	more	or	less	intelligent	design	--	and	 re 	 designed 	 	by	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	who	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 re 	 design 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 relig 	 ions 	 	.
you	do	n't	do	book	 talk 	 s 	 	at	ted	,	but	i	'm	going	to	have	just	one	slide	about	my	book	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	is	one	 mess 	 age 	 	in	it	which	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	group	 re 	 ally 	 	 need 	 s 	 	to	hear	.
and	i	would	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	to	get	your	 respons 	 es 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	's	the	one	policy	proposal	that	i	make	in	the	book	,	at	 th 	 is 	 	time	when	i	claim	not	to	know	 en 	 ough 	 	about	 relig 	 ion 	 	to	know	what	other	policy	 proposal 	 s 	 	to	make	.
and	it	's	one	that	 echo 	 es 	 	 remark 	 s 	 	that	you	've	heard	 al 	 ready 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
here	's	my	proposal	.
i	'm	going	to	just	take	a	couple	of	 minute 	 s 	 	to	explain	it	--	education	in	world	 relig 	 ions 	 	,	on	world	 relig 	 ions 	 	,	for	all	of	our	children	in	 prim 	 ary 	 	school	,	in	high	school	,	in	public	 school 	 s 	 	,	in	private	 school 	 s 	 	and	in	home	 school 	 ing 	 	.
so	what	i	'm	 pro 	 posing 	 	is	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	we	 requir 	 e 	 	 read 	 ing 	 	,	writing	,	arithmetic	,	american	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	so	we	should	have	a	curriculum	on	 fact 	 s 	 	about	all	the	 relig 	 ions 	 	of	the	world	--	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 cre 	 ed 	 s 	 	,	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 text 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	music	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 symbol 	 ism 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 prohibit 	 ions 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 requir 	 ement 	 s 	 	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	should	be	 present 	 ed 	 	 factual 	 ly 	 	,	 straight 	 forward 	 ly 	 	,	with	no	 part 	 icular 	 	spin	,	to	all	of	the	children	in	the	country	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	you	teach	them	that	,	you	can	teach	them	 any 	 thing 	 	else	you	like	.
that	,	i	think	,	is	 maxim 	 al 	 	 toler 	 ance 	 	for	religious	 free 	 dom 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	you	inform	your	children	about	other	 relig 	 ions 	 	,	then	you	may	--	and	 a 	 s 	 	early	 a 	 s 	 	you	like	and	 what 	 ever 	 	you	like	--	teach	them	 what 	 ever 	 	 cre 	 ed 	 	you	want	them	to	learn	.
but	 al 	 so 	 	let	them	know	about	other	 relig 	 ions 	 	.
now	why	do	i	say	that	?
 be 	 cause 	 	 demo 	 cracy 	 	 depend 	 s 	 	on	an	 inform 	 ed 	 	 citizen 	 ship 	 	.	 inform 	 ed 	 	consent	is	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 bed 	 rock 	 	of	our	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	 demo 	 cracy 	 	.
 mis 	 inform 	 ed 	 	consent	is	not	worth	it	.
it	's	like	a	 co 	 in 	 	flip	;	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	count	 re 	 ally 	 	.
 demo 	 cracy 	 	 depend 	 s 	 	on	 inform 	 ed 	 	consent	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	way	we	treat	people	 a 	 s 	 	 respons 	 ible 	 	 adult 	 s 	 	.
now	,	children	 be 	 low 	 	the	age	of	consent	are	a	special	case	.
i	'm	going	to	use	a	word	that	pastor	rick	just	used	--	 parent 	 s 	 	are	 steward 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	children	.
they	do	n't	own	them	.
you	ca	n't	own	your	children	.
you	have	a	 respons 	 ibility 	 	to	the	world	,	to	the	state	,	to	them	,	to	take	care	of	them	right	.
you	may	teach	them	 what 	 ever 	 	 cre 	 ed 	 	you	think	is	most	 import 	 ant 	 	,	but	i	say	you	have	a	 respons 	 ibility 	 	to	let	them	be	 inform 	 ed 	 	about	all	the	other	 cre 	 ed 	 s 	 	in	the	world	,	too	.
the	reason	i	've	taken	 th 	 is 	 	time	is	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 fascinate 	 d 	 	to	hear	some	of	the	 react 	 ions 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
one	 review 	 er 	 	for	a	roman	catholic	 news 	 paper 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	it	``	 total 	 itarian 	 	.	``
it	 strike 	 s 	 	me	 a 	 s 	 	 practical 	 ly 	 	libertarian	.
is	it	 total 	 itarian 	 	to	 requir 	 e 	 	 read 	 ing 	 	,	writing	and	arithmetic	?
i	do	n't	think	so	.
all	i	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	is	--	 fact 	 s 	 	.	 fact 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	.
no	 value 	 s 	 	,	just	 fact 	 s 	 	about	all	the	world	's	 relig 	 ions 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	 review 	 er 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	it	``	hilarious	.	``
well	,	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 both 	 er 	 ed 	 	by	the	fact	that	 any 	 body 	 	would	think	that	was	hilarious	.
it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	to	be	 s 	 uch 	 	a	plausible	,	natural	 extens 	 ion 	 	of	the	 democrat 	 ic 	 	 principle 	 s 	 	we	 al 	 ready 	 	have	,	that	i	'm	 shock 	 ed 	 	to	think	 any 	 body 	 	would	find	that	just	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	.
i	know	 man 	 y 	 	 relig 	 ions 	 	are	so	 anx 	 ious 	 	about	 pre 	 serv 	 ing 	 	the	 pur 	 ity 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	faith	among	 the 	 ir 	 	children	that	they	are	intent	on	 keep 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	children	 ignor 	 ant 	 	of	other	 faith 	 s 	 	.
i	do	n't	think	that	's	 def 	 en 	 s 	 ible 	 	,	but	i	'd	 re 	 ally 	 	be	 pleas 	 ed 	 	to	get	your	 answer 	 s 	 	on	that	--	any	 react 	 ions 	 	to	that	--	 lat 	 er 	 	.
but	now	i	'm	going	to	move	on	.
back	to	the	cow	.
 th 	 is 	 	picture	,	which	i	 pull 	 ed 	 	off	the	web	--	the	fellow	on	the	left	is	 re 	 ally 	 	an	 import 	 ant 	 	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	picture	.
that	's	the	steward	.
 cow 	 s 	 	could	n't	live	 with 	 out 	 	human	 steward 	 s 	 	--	they	're	 domestic 	 ated 	 	.	they	're	a	sort	of	ectosymbiont	.
they	depend	on	us	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 surviv 	 al 	 	.
and	pastor	rick	was	just	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	sheep	.
i	'm	going	to	talk	about	sheep	,	too	.
there	's	a	lot	of	serendipitous	 converg 	 ence 	 	here	.
how	clever	it	was	of	sheep	to	 acquir 	 e 	 	 shepherd 	 s 	 	!
think	of	what	 th 	 is 	 	got	them	.
they	could	 out 	 source 	 	all	 the 	 ir 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	--	 protect 	 ion 	 	from	 predator 	 s 	 	,	food	 find 	 ing 	 	,	health	maintenance	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	cost	in	most	 flock 	 s 	 	is	a	loss	of	free	 mat 	 ing 	 	.
what	a	deal	.
``	how	clever	of	sheep	!	``	you	might	say	.
 ex 	 cept 	 	,	of	course	,	it	was	n't	the	sheep	's	 clever 	 ness 	 	.
we	all	know	sheep	are	not	 exact 	 ly 	 	rocket	 scientist 	 s 	 	--	they	're	not	 ver 	 y 	 	smart	.
it	was	n't	the	 clever 	 ness 	 	of	the	sheep	at	all	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 clue 	 less 	 	.
but	it	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	clever	move	.
 who 	 s 	 e 	 	clever	move	was	it	?
it	was	a	clever	move	of	natural	 s 	 election 	 	 it 	 self 	 	.
francis	crick	,	the	co	-	 discover 	 er 	 	of	the	structure	of	dna	with	jim	watson	,	once	 jok 	 ed 	 	about	what	he	 call 	 ed 	 	orgel	's	second	rule	.
leslie	orgel	is	still	a	 mole 	 cular 	 	biologist	,	 brilli 	 ant 	 	guy	,	and	orgel	's	second	rule	is	:	evolution	is	 clever 	 er 	 	than	you	are	.
now	,	that	is	not	intelligent	design	--	not	from	francis	crick	.
evolution	is	 clever 	 er 	 	than	you	are	.
if	you	understand	orgel	's	second	rule	,	then	you	understand	why	the	intelligent	design	 move 	 ment 	 	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	a	hoax	.
the	 design 	 s 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	by	the	process	of	natural	 s 	 election 	 	are	 brilli 	 ant 	 	,	 un 	 believ 	 ably 	 	 brilli 	 ant 	 	.
 aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	 biologist 	 s 	 	are	 fascinate 	 d 	 	with	the	 brilli 	 ance 	 	of	what	's	 discover 	 ed 	 	.
but	the	process	 it 	 self 	 	is	 with 	 out 	 	purpose	,
 with 	 out 	 	 fore 	 sight 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	design	.
when	i	was	here	four	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	told	the	story	about	an	ant	 climb 	 ing 	 	a	blade	of	grass	.
and	why	was	the	ant	 do 	 ing 	 	it	?
well	,	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	 it 	 s 	 	brain	had	 be 	 en 	 	 infect 	 ed 	 	with	a	 lance 	 t 	 	 flu 	 ke 	 	that	was	--	 need 	 ed 	 	to	get	 in 	 to 	 	the	 bel 	 ly 	 	of	a	sheep	or	a	cow	in	order	to	 re 	 produce 	 	.
it	was	sort	of	a	 s 	 pooky 	 	story	.
and	i	think	some	people	may	have	 mis 	 under 	 stood 	 	.
 lance 	 t 	 	 flu 	 ke 	 s 	 	are	n't	smart	.
i	submit	that	the	 intellig 	 ence 	 	of	a	 lance 	 t 	 	 flu 	 ke 	 	is	down	there	 some 	 where 	 	between	petunia	and	carrot	.
they	're	not	 re 	 ally 	 	bright	.	they	do	n't	have	to	be	.
the	 less 	 on 	 	we	learn	from	 th 	 is 	 	is	you	do	n't	have	to	have	a	mind	to	be	a	 benefici 	 ary 	 	.
the	design	is	there	in	nature	,	but	it	's	not	in	 any 	 body 	 	's	head	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	to	be	.
that	's	the	way	evolution	 work 	 s 	 	.
the	question	--	was	 domestic 	 ation 	 	good	for	sheep	?
it	was	great	for	 the 	 ir 	 	genetic	 fit 	 ness 	 	.
and	here	i	want	to	 re 	 mind 	 	you	of	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	point	that	paul	maccready	made	at	ted	three	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
here	's	what	he	 s 	 aid 	 	.
10,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	at	the	dawn	of	 agricultur 	 e 	 	,	human	population	,	plus	 live 	 stock 	 	and	 pet 	 s 	 	,	was	 approximate 	 ly 	 	a	tenth	of	one	per	cent	of	the	terrestrial	 vertebra 	 e 	 	 land 	 mass 	 	.
that	was	just	10,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
 yester 	 day 	 	,	in	 bio 	 logical 	 	 term 	 s 	 	.
what	is	it	 to 	 day 	 	?	 do 	 es 	 	 any 	 body 	 	remember	what	he	told	us	?
98	percent	.
that	is	what	we	have	 d 	 one 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	.
now	,	i	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	paul	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	check	to	find	out	how	he	'd	 calcul 	 ated 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,
and	get	the	 source 	 s 	 	and	so	forth	.
and	he	 g 	 ave 	 	me	a	paper	that	he	had	written	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
there	was	a	 pass 	 age 	 	in	it	which	he	did	not	present	here	and	i	think	it	is	so	good	i	'm	going	to	read	it	to	you	.
``	over	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	on	a	 un 	 ique 	 	sphere	,	chance	 ha 	 s 	 	 paint 	 ed 	 	a	thin	 cover 	 ing 	 	of	life	:	complex	,	 im 	 prob 	 able 	 	,	 wonder 	 ful 	 	and	fragile	.	 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	we	 human 	 s 	 	,	a	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 arriv 	 ed 	 	species	no	 long 	 er 	 	subject	to	the	 check 	 s 	 	and	 balance 	 s 	 	inherent	in	nature	,	have	grown	in	population	,	technology	and	 intellig 	 ence 	 	to	a	position	of	 terr 	 ible 	 	power	.

 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 par 	 ch 	 ment 	 	music	page	that	i	found	in	a	paris	 book 	 stall 	 	50	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	on	it	it	 say 	 s 	 	,	in	latin	:	the	word	of	god	is	the	seed	and	the	 s 	 ow 	 er 	 	of	the	seed	is	christ	.	``
same	idea	!	well	,	not	 quit 	 e 	 	.
but	in	fact	,	christians	,	too	,	 glor 	 y 	 	in	the	fact	that	they	have	 surrender 	 ed 	 	to	god	.
i	'll	give	you	a	few	 quote 	 s 	 	.
``	the	heart	of	worship	is	surrender	.
 surrender 	 ed 	 	people	obey	god	's	 word 	 s 	 	,	even	if	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	sense	.	``
 t 	 hose 	 	 word 	 s 	 	are	by	rick	warren	.
 t 	 hose 	 	are	from	``	the	purpose	driven	life	.	``
and	i	want	to	turn	now	,	 brief 	 ly 	 	,	to	talk	about	that	book	,	which	i	've	read	.
you	've	all	got	a	copy	.
you	've	just	heard	the	man	.
and	what	i	want	to	do	now	is	say	a	bit	about	 th 	 is 	 	book	from	the	design	 stand 	 point 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 brilli 	 ant 	 	book	.
first	of	all	,	the	goal	.
and	you	heard	just	now	what	the	goal	is	.
it	's	to	 br 	 ing 	 	purpose	to	the	 live 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	,	and	he	 ha 	 s 	 	 succeed 	 ed 	 	.
is	it	a	good	goal	?
in	 it 	 self 	 	,	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	we	all	agree	,	it	is	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	goal	.
he	's	 absolute 	 ly 	 	right	.
there	are	 lot 	 s 	 	of	people	out	there	who	do	n't	have	purpose	in	 the 	 ir 	 	life	,	and	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	purpose	to	 the 	 ir 	 	life	is	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	goal	.
i	give	him	an	a	+	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
is	the	goal	 achiev 	 ed 	 	?
 y 	 es 	 	.
30	million	copies	of	 th 	 is 	 	book	.
al	gore	,	eat	your	heart	out	.
just	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	al	is	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	,	rick	is	 do 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	fantastic	 achiev 	 ement 	 	.
and	,	the	 mean 	 s 	 	--	how	 do 	 es 	 	he	do	it	?
it	's	a	 brilli 	 ant 	 	 re 	 design 	 	of	 tradition 	 al 	 	religious	 theme 	 s 	 	--	 up 	 d 	 ating 	 	them	,	 quiet 	 ly 	 	dropping	 obsolet 	 e 	 	 feature 	 s 	 	,	 put 	 ting 	 	new	 interpret 	 ations 	 	on	other	 feature 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	evolution	of	 relig 	 ion 	 	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	going	on	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	he	's	just	the	 lat 	 est 	 	 brilli 	 ant 	 	practitioner	of	it	.
i	do	n't	have	to	tell	you	 th 	 is 	 	.	you	've	just	heard	the	man	.
 excel 	 lent 	 	 in 	 sight 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	human	 psycho 	 logy 	 	,	wise	 ad 	 vice 	 	on	every	page	.
 more 	 over 	 	,	he	 invit 	 es 	 	us	to	look	under	the	hood	.
i	 re 	 ally 	 	 appreciate 	 d 	 	that	.
for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	he	 ha 	 s 	 	an	 append 	 ix 	 	where	he	 explain 	 s 	 	his	choice	of	 transl 	 ations 	 	of	different	 b 	 ible 	 	 verse 	 s 	 	.
the	book	is	clear	,	 vivi 	 d 	 	,	 access 	 ible 	 	,	 beaut 	 i 	 fully 	 	 format 	 ted 	 	.
just	 en 	 ough 	 	 re 	 petition 	 	.
that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
every	time	you	read	it	or	say	it	,	you	make	 an 	 other 	 	copy	in	your	brain	.
every	time	you	read	it	or	say	it	,	you	make	 an 	 other 	 	copy	in	your	brain	.
with	me	,	 every 	 body 	 	--	every	time	you	read	it	or	say	it	,	you	make	 an 	 other 	 	copy	in	your	brain	.
thank	you	.
and	now	we	come	to	my	problem	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 since 	 re 	 	in	my	 appreci 	 ation 	 	of	all	that	i	've	 s 	 aid 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	book	.
but	i	wish	it	 we 	 re 	 	better	.
i	have	some	 problem 	 s 	 	with	the	book	.
and	it	would	just	be	 in 	 since 	 re 	 	of	me	not	to	address	 t 	 hose 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	.
i	wish	he	could	do	 th 	 is 	 	with	a	 re 	 vision 	 	,	a	mark	2	version	of	his	book	.
``	the	truth	will	set	you	free	``	--	that	's	what	it	 say 	 s 	 	in	the	 b 	 ible 	 	,	and	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	want	to	live	by	,	too	.
my	problem	is	,	some	of	the	bits	in	it	i	do	n't	think	are	true	.
now	some	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	of	opinion	,	and	that	's	not	my	main	 complain 	 t 	 	.
that	's	worth	 ment 	 ion 	 ing 	 	.
here	's	a	 pass 	 age 	 	--	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	much	what	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 any 	 way 	 	.
``	if	there	was	no	god	we	would	all	be	 accident 	 s 	 	,	the	result	of	astronomical	random	chance	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
you	could	stop	 read 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	book	 be 	 cause 	 	life	would	have	no	purpose	or	meaning	or	 sign 	 ific 	 ance 	 	.
there	would	be	no	right	or	wrong	and	no	hope	beyond	your	brief	 year 	 s 	 	on	earth	.	``
now	,	i	just	do	not	 believ 	 e 	 	that	.
by	the	way	,	i	find	homer	groening	's	film	 present 	 ed 	 	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 alter 	 native 	 	to	that	 ver 	 y 	 	claim	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	there	is	meaning	and	a	reason	for	right	or	wrong	.
we	do	n't	need	a	belief	in	god	to	be	good	or	to	have	meaning	in	us	.
but	that	is	just	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	of	opinion	.
that	's	not	what	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	.
how	about	 th 	 is 	 	--	``	god	designed	 th 	 is 	 	planet	's	environment	just	so	we	could	live	in	it	.	``
i	'm	 af 	 raid 	 	that	a	lot	of	people	take	that	sentiment	to	mean	that	we	do	n't	have	to	do	the	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	al	gore	is	 try 	 ing 	 	so	hard	to	get	us	to	do	.
i	'm	not	happy	with	that	sentiment	at	all	.
and	then	i	find	 th 	 is 	 	--	``	all	the	evidence	 avail 	 able 	 	in	the	 bio 	 logical 	 	 science 	 s 	 	 support 	 s 	 	the	core	 pro 	 position 	 	that	the	 cosmo 	 s 	 	is	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	designed	whole	with	life	and	 man 	 kind 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	fundamental	goal	and	purpose	,	a	whole	in	which	all	 facet 	 s 	 	of	 re 	 ality 	 	have	 the 	 ir 	 	meaning	and	 explan 	 ation 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	central	fact	.	``
well	,	that	's	michael	denton	.	he	's	a	 creation 	 ist 	 	.
and	here	i	think	,	``	wait	a	minute	.	``
i	read	 th 	 is 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
i	read	it	three	or	four	 time 	 s 	 	and	i	think	,	``	is	he	 re 	 ally 	 	 end 	 ors 	 ing 	 	intelligent	design	?
is	he	 end 	 ors 	 ing 	 	 creation 	 ism 	 	here	?	``
and	you	ca	n't	tell	.
so	i	'm	sort	of	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	well	,	i	do	n't	know	,	i	do	n't	know	if	i	want	to	get	 up 	 set 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	yet	.	``
but	then	i	read	on	and	i	read	 th 	 is 	 	:	``	first	,	noah	had	never	 s 	 een 	 	rain	,	 be 	 cause 	 	prior	to	the	flood	god	 irrig 	 ated 	 	the	earth	from	the	ground	up	.	``
i	wish	that	sentence	 we 	 re 	 	n't	in	there	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	it	is	false	.
and	i	think	that	 think 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	way	about	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	the	planet	,	after	we	've	just	 be 	 en 	 	 hear 	 ing 	 	about	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	the	planet	over	 million 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	 dis 	 courage 	 s 	 	people	from	scientific	 understand 	 ing 	 	.
now	,	rick	warren	uses	scientific	 term 	 s 	 	and	scientific	 fact 	 oid 	 s 	 	and	information	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	way	.
here	's	one	:	``	god	 de 	 liberate 	 ly 	 	shaped	and	 form 	 ed 	 	you	to	serve	him	in	a	way	that	 make 	 s 	 	your	 mini 	 stry 	 	 un 	 ique 	 	.
he	 care 	 fully 	 	 mix 	 ed 	 	the	dna	 cock 	 tail 	 	that	 create 	 d 	 	you	.	``
i	think	that	's	false	.
now	 may 	 be 	 	we	want	to	treat	it	 a 	 s 	 	 metaphor 	 ical 	 	.
here	's	 an 	 other 	 	one	--	``	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	your	brain	can	store	100	trillion	 fact 	 s 	 	.
your	mind	can	handle	15,000	 decision 	 s 	 	a	second	.	``
well	,	it	would	be	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	find	the	 interpret 	 ation 	 	where	i	would	accept	that	.
there	might	be	some	way	of	 treat 	 ing 	 	that	 a 	 s 	 	true	.
``	 anthropo 	 logists 	 	have	 not 	 ed 	 	that	worship	is	a	universal	urge	,	 hard 	 wired 	 	by	god	 in 	 to 	 	the	 ver 	 y 	 	fiber	of	our	 be 	 ing 	 	,	an	 in 	 built 	 	need	to	connect	with	god	.	``
well	,	there	's	a	sense	which	i	agree	with	him	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	i	think	it	 ha 	 s 	 	an	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 explan 	 ation 	 	.
and	what	i	find	 deep 	 ly 	 	 trou 	 bling 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	book	is	that	he	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	 argu 	 ing 	 	that	if	you	want	to	be	moral	,	if	you	want	to	have	meaning	in	your	life	,	you	have	to	be	an	intelligent	 design 	 er 	 	--	you	have	to	 den 	 y 	 	the	 theor 	 y 	 	of	evolution	by	natural	 s 	 election 	 	.
and	i	think	,	on	the	 contr 	 ary 	 	,	that	it	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	solving	the	world	's	 problem 	 s 	 	that	we	take	 evolution 	 ary 	 	biology	 serious 	 ly 	 	.
 who 	 s 	 e 	 	truth	are	we	going	to	listen	to	?
well	,	 th 	 is 	 	from	``	the	purpose	driven	life	``	--	``	the	 b 	 ible 	 	must	 be 	 come 	 	the	 author 	 itative 	 	standard	for	my	life	,	the	compass	i	 re 	 ly 	 	on	for	direction	,	the	counsel	i	listen	to	for	making	wise	 decision 	 s 	 	and	the	 bench 	 mark 	 	i	use	for	 evalu 	 ating 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	.	``
well	 may 	 be 	 	,	ok	,	but	what	's	going	to	follow	from	 th 	 is 	 	?
and	here	's	one	that	 do 	 es 	 	concern	me	.
remember	i	 quote 	 d 	 	him	before	with	 th 	 is 	 	line	--	``	 surrender 	 ed 	 	people	obey	god	's	word	,	even	if	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	sense	.	``
and	that	's	a	problem	.
``	do	n't	ever	 argu 	 e 	 	with	the	devil	.
he	's	better	at	 argu 	 ing 	 	than	you	are	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	had	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	to	practice	.	``
now	rick	warren	did	n't	invent	 th 	 is 	 	clever	move	.
it	's	an	old	move	.
it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	clever	 adapt 	 ation 	 	of	 relig 	 ions 	 	.
it	's	a	 wild 	 card 	 	for	 dis 	 arm 	 ing 	 	any	 reason 	 able 	 	 critic 	 ism 	 	.
``	you	do	n't	like	my	 interpret 	 ation 	 	?
you	've	got	a	 reason 	 able 	 	 object 	 ion 	 	to	it	?
do	n't	listen	,	do	n't	listen	!
that	's	the	devil	 s 	 peaking 	 	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	 dis 	 courage 	 s 	 	the	sort	of	 reason 	 ing 	 	 citizen 	 ship 	 	it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	that	we	want	to	have	.
i	've	got	one	more	problem	,	then	i	'm	through	.
and	i	'd	 re 	 ally 	 	like	to	get	a	 respons 	 e 	 	if	rick	is	able	to	do	it	.
``	in	the	great	commission	,	jesus	 s 	 aid 	 	,	'	go	to	all	people	of	all	 nation 	 s 	 	and	make	them	my	 discip 	 les 	 	.	baptize	them	in	the	name	of	the	father	,	the	son	and	the	holy	spirit	,	and	teach	them	to	do	 every 	 thing 	 	i	've	told	you	.	'	``
the	 b 	 ible 	 	 say 	 s 	 	jesus	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	one	who	can	 s 	 ave 	 	the	world	.
now	here	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 map 	 s 	 	of	the	world	in	the	last	day	or	so	.
here	's	one	,	not	 a 	 s 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 other 	 s 	 	.
it	 simpl 	 y 	 	 show 	 s 	 	the	 relig 	 ions 	 	of	the	world	.
and	here	's	one	that	 show 	 s 	 	the	sort	of	current	 break 	 down 	 	of	the	different	 relig 	 ions 	 	.
now	do	we	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	commit	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	 engulf 	 ing 	 	all	the	other	 relig 	 ions 	 	when	 the 	 ir 	 	holy	 book 	 s 	 	are	 tell 	 ing 	 	them	,	``	do	n't	listen	to	the	other	side	,	that	's	just	satan	 talk 	 ing 	 	!	``
it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	that	that	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 problem 	 atic 	 	ship	to	get	on	for	the	future	.
i	found	 th 	 is 	 	sign	 a 	 s 	 	i	was	 driv 	 ing 	 	to	maine	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	in	front	of	a	church	--	``	good	 with 	 out 	 	god	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	zero	.	``	sort	of	cute	.
a	 ver 	 y 	 	clever	little	meme	.
i	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	it	and	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	idea	,	popular	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	--	not	in	 th 	 is 	 	guise	but	in	general	--	is	 it 	 self 	 	one	of	the	main	 problem 	 s 	 	that	we	face	.
if	you	are	like	me	,	you	know	 man 	 y 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	,	 commit 	 ted 	 	,	 engag 	 ed 	 	 atheist 	 s 	 	,	 agnostic 	 s 	 	,	who	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 with 	 out 	 	god	.

so	,	i	wish	we	could	drop	 th 	 is 	 	meme	.
