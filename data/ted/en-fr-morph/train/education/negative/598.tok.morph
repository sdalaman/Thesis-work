 be 	 cause 	 	of	what	i	'm	about	to	say	,	i	 re 	 ally 	 	should	establish	my	green	credentials	.
when	i	was	a	small	boy	,	i	took	my	 pledg 	 e 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	american	,	to	 s 	 ave 	 	and	 faith 	 fully 	 	defend	from	waste	the	natural	 resource 	 s 	 	of	my	country	,

and	then	 work 	 ed 	 	for	the	jerry	 brow 	 n 	 	 administr 	 ation 	 	.
the	 brow 	 n 	 	 administr 	 ation 	 	,	and	a	bunch	of	my	 friend 	 s 	 	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	 level 	 ed 	 	the	energy	efficiency	of	california	,
so	it	's	the	same	now	,	30	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,
even	 th 	 ough 	 	our	 eco 	 nomy 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	up	80	percent	,	per	capita	.
and	we	are	 put 	 ting 	 	out	less	 green 	 house 	 	 gas 	 s 	 es 	 	than	any	other	state	.
california	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	europe	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	year	,	whole	earth	catalog	 ha 	 s 	 	a	supplement	that	i	'll	 pre 	 view 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	 call 	 ed 	 	whole	earth	discipline	.
the	 domin 	 ant 	 	 demo 	 graphic 	 	event	of	our	time	is	 th 	 is 	 	screamingly	rapid	 urban 	 ization 	 	that	we	have	going	on	.
by	mid	-	century	we	'll	be	about	80	percent	urban	,
and	that	's	 most 	 ly 	 	in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	,	where	that	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	is	driven	to	a	large	degree	by	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	cities	.
the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	now	 ha 	 s 	 	all	of	the	 big 	 gest 	 	cities	,
and	they	are	 develop 	 ing 	 	three	 time 	 s 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	than	the	 develop 	 ed 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	and	nine	 time 	 s 	 	 big 	 ger 	 	.
it	's	 qual 	 itative 	 ly 	 	different	.
they	are	the	 driver 	 s 	 	of	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	see	by	looking	at	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
1,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	the	world	 look 	 ed 	 	like	.
well	we	now	have	a	 distribut 	 ion 	 	of	urban	power	similar	to	what	we	had	1,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	the	rise	of	the	west	,	 dramat 	 ic 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	was	,	is	over	.
the	 aggreg 	 ate 	 	 number 	 s 	 	are	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 overwhelm 	 ing 	 	:
1.3	million	people	a	week	coming	to	town	,	decade	after	decade	.
what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	going	on	?
well	,	what	's	going	on	is	the	 village 	 s 	 	of	the	world	are	 empty 	 ing 	 	out	.
 sub 	 s 	 ist 	 ence 	 	 farm 	 ing 	 	is	 dry 	 ing 	 	up	 bas 	 ically 	 	.
people	are	 follow 	 ing 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	 in 	 to 	 	town	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	why	.
i	used	to	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	romantic	idea	about	 village 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	i	never	lived	in	one	.
 be 	 cause 	 	in	town	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 bust 	 ling 	 	 squat 	 ter 	 	city	of	kibera	,	near	nairobi	--	they	see	action	.	they	see	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
they	see	a	cash	 eco 	 nomy 	 	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	not	able	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	in	back	in	the	 sub 	 s 	 ist 	 ence 	 	farm	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	go	around	these	 place 	 s 	 	there	's	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	 aesthetic 	 s 	 	.
there	is	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	going	on	.
they	are	poor	,	but	they	are	 intens 	 e 	 ly 	 	urban	.	and	they	are	 intens 	 e 	 ly 	 	creative	.
the	 aggreg 	 ate 	 	 number 	 s 	 	now	are	that	 bas 	 ically 	 	 squat 	 ter 	 s 	 	,	all	one	billion	of	them	,	are	building	the	urban	world	,
which	 mean 	 s 	 	they	're	building	the	world	--
 personal 	 ly 	 	,	one	by	one	,	family	by	family	,	 cl 	 an 	 	by	 cl 	 an 	 	,	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	by	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	.
they	start	flimsy	and	they	get	 sub 	 stantial 	 	 a 	 s 	 	time	 go 	 es 	 	by	.
they	even	build	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 infra 	 structure 	 	.
well	,	steal	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 infra 	 structure 	 	,	at	first	.
cable	tv	,	water	,	the	whole	 ga 	 mut 	 	,	all	 get 	 s 	 	 stole 	 n 	 	.
and	then	 gradu 	 ally 	 	gentrifies	.
it	is	not	the	case	that	 s 	 lum 	 s 	 	 under 	 mine 	 	 prosper 	 ity 	 	,
not	the	 work 	 ing 	 	 s 	 lum 	 s 	 	;	they	help	create	 prosper 	 ity 	 	.
so	in	a	town	like	mumbai	,	which	is	half	 s 	 lum 	 s 	 	,	it	's	1/6th	of	the	gdp	of	india	.
social	capital	in	the	 s 	 lum 	 s 	 	is	at	 it 	 s 	 	most	urban	and	dense	.
these	people	are	 valu 	 able 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	group	.
and	that	's	how	they	work	.
there	is	a	lot	of	people	who	think	about	all	these	poor	people	,	``	oh	there	's	 terr 	 ible 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.	we	've	got	to	fix	 the 	 ir 	 	housing	.	``
it	used	to	be	,	``	oh	we	've	got	to	get	them	phone	service	.	``
now	they	're	 show 	 ing 	 	us	how	they	do	 the 	 ir 	 	phone	service	.
famine	 most 	 ly 	 	is	a	 r 	 ural 	 	event	now	.
there	are	 thing 	 s 	 	they	care	about	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	we	can	help	.
and	the	 nation 	 s 	 	they	're	in	can	help	.
and	they	are	 help 	 ing 	 	each	other	solve	these	 issue 	 s 	 	.
and	you	go	to	a	nice	dense	place	like	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 lum 	 	in	mumbai	.
you	look	at	that	lane	on	the	right	.
and	you	can	ask	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	what	's	going	on	there	?	``
the	answer	is	,	``	 every 	 thing 	 	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	better	than	a	mall	.	it	's	much	 den 	 s 	 er 	 	.
it	's	much	more	 inter 	 active 	 	.
and	the	scale	is	 terr 	 ific 	 	.
the	main	event	is	,	these	are	not	people	 crush 	 ed 	 	by	poverty	.
these	are	people	 bus 	 y 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	out	of	poverty	just	 a 	 s 	 	fast	 a 	 s 	 	they	can	.
they	're	 help 	 ing 	 	each	other	do	it	.
they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	through	an	 out 	 law 	 	thing	,	the	 inform 	 al 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
the	 inform 	 al 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	it	's	sort	of	like	dark	energy	in	 astro 	 physics 	 	:
it	's	not	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	there	,	but	it	's	huge	.
we	do	n't	understand	how	it	 work 	 s 	 	yet	,	but	we	have	to	.
 further 	 more 	 	,	people	in	the	 inform 	 al 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	the	gray	 eco 	 nomy 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	time	 go 	 es 	 	by	,	crime	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	around	them	.	and	they	can	join	the	criminal	world	,	or	they	can	join	the	legitimate	world	.
we	should	be	able	to	make	that	choice	 eas 	 ier 	 	for	them	to	get	 to 	 ward 	 	the	legitimate	world	,
 be 	 cause 	 	if	we	do	n't	,	they	will	go	 to 	 ward 	 	the	criminal	world	.
there	's	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	activity	.
in	dharavi	the	 s 	 lum 	 	 perform 	 s 	 	not	 on 	 ly 	 	a	lot	of	 service 	 s 	 	for	 it 	 self 	 	,	but	it	 perform 	 s 	 	 service 	 s 	 	for	the	city	at	large	.
and	one	of	the	main	 event 	 s 	 	are	these	ad	-	hoc	 school 	 s 	 	.
 parent 	 s 	 	pool	 the 	 ir 	 	money	to	hire	some	local	 teacher 	 s 	 	to	a	private	,	 tin 	 y 	 	,	 un 	 official 	 	school	.
education	is	more	possible	in	the	cities	,	and	that	 change 	 s 	 	the	world	.
so	you	see	some	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	typical	,	urban	 thing 	 s 	 	.	so	one	thing	 s 	 lam 	 med 	 	up	against	 an 	 other 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	in	sao	paulo	here	.
that	's	what	cities	do	.	that	's	how	they	create	value	,	is	by	 s 	 lam 	 ming 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	together	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	supply	right	next	to	demand	.
so	the	 maid 	 s 	 	and	the	 garden 	 ers 	 	and	the	 guard 	 s 	 	that	live	in	 th 	 is 	 	 live 	 ly 	 	part	of	town	on	the	left	walk	to	work	,	in	the	 bor 	 ing 	 	,	rich	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	.
 proxim 	 ity 	 	is	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
we	are	 learn 	 ing 	 	about	how	dense	 proxim 	 ity 	 	can	be	.
 connect 	 ivity 	 	between	the	city	and	the	country	is	what	's	going	to	keep	the	country	good	,
 be 	 cause 	 	the	city	 ha 	 s 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	ways	of	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 make 	 s 	 	cities	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 make 	 s 	 	cities	so	green	in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	.
 be 	 cause 	 	people	 leav 	 e 	 	the	poverty	trap	,	an	 eco 	 logical 	 	disaster	of	 sub 	 s 	 ist 	 ence 	 	 farm 	 s 	 	,	and	head	to	town	.
and	when	they	're	gone	the	natural	environment	 start 	 s 	 	to	come	back	 ver 	 y 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	who	remain	in	the	village	can	shift	over	to	cash	 crop 	 s 	 	to	 s 	 end 	 	food	to	the	new	growing	 market 	 s 	 	in	town	.
so	if	you	want	to	 s 	 ave 	 	a	village	,	you	do	it	with	a	good	road	,	or	with	a	good	cell	phone	 connect 	 ion 	 	,	and	 ideal 	 ly 	 	some	grid	 electric 	 al 	 	power	.
so	the	event	is	:	we	're	a	city	planet	.	that	just	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
more	than	half	.	the	 number 	 s 	 	are	 consider 	 able 	 	.	a	billion	live	in	the	 squat 	 ter 	 	cities	now	.
 an 	 other 	 	billion	is	 expect 	 ed 	 	.
that	's	more	than	a	sixth	of	 human 	 ity 	 	living	a	certain	way	.
and	that	will	determine	a	lot	of	how	we	function	.
now	,	for	us	 environment 	 alist 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	the	 green 	 est 	 	thing	about	the	cities	is	they	diffuse	the	population	bomb	.	people	get	 in 	 to 	 	town	.	the	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	have	 few 	 er 	 	children	.
they	do	n't	even	have	to	get	rich	yet	.	just	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	of	coming	up	in	the	world	 mean 	 s 	 	they	will	have	 few 	 er 	 	,	 high 	 er 	 	-	quality	 kid 	 s 	 	,	and	the	birthrate	 go 	 es 	 	down	 radical 	 ly 	 	.
 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	side	effect	here	,	here	's	a	slide	from	phillip	longman	.
 show 	 s 	 	what	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	we	have	more	and	more	old	people	,	like	me	,	and	 few 	 er 	 	and	 few 	 er 	 	 bab 	 ies 	 	.
and	they	are	 region 	 ally 	 	 separat 	 ed 	 	.
what	you	're	 get 	 ting 	 	is	a	world	which	is	old	 folk 	 s 	 	,	and	old	cities	,	going	around	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	the	old	way	,	in	the	north	.
and	young	people	in	brand	new	cities	they	're	 invent 	 ing 	 	,	 do 	 ing 	 	new	 thing 	 s 	 	,	in	the	south	.
where	do	you	think	the	action	is	going	to	be	?
shift	of	subject	.	 quick 	 ly 	 	drop	by	climate	.
the	climate	news	,	i	'm	sorry	to	say	,	is	going	to	keep	 get 	 ting 	 	 wo 	 rse 	 	than	we	think	,	 fast 	 er 	 	than	we	think	.
climate	is	a	 pro 	 found 	 ly 	 	complex	,	 non 	 linear 	 	system	,	full	of	 run 	 away 	 	positive	 feed 	 back 	 s 	 	,	 hid 	 den 	 	 threshold 	 s 	 	and	 irrevoc 	 able 	 	 tip 	 ping 	 	 point 	 s 	 	.
here	's	just	a	few	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
we	're	going	to	keep	 be 	 ing 	 	 surprise 	 d 	 	.	and	 al 	 most 	 	all	the	 surprise 	 s 	 	are	going	to	be	bad	 one 	 s 	 	.
from	your	 stand 	 point 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	a	great	 in 	 crease 	 	in	climate	 refuge 	 es 	 	over	the	coming	 decade 	 s 	 	,
and	what	 go 	 es 	 	 a 	 long 	 	with	that	,	which	is	resource	 war 	 s 	 	and	 cha 	 os 	 	 war 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	in	darfur	.
that	's	what	drought	 do 	 es 	 	.
it	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	 carry 	 ing 	 	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	down	,
and	there	's	not	 en 	 ough 	 	 carry 	 ing 	 	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	support	the	people	.	and	then	you	're	in	trouble	.
shift	to	the	power	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
 base 	 load 	 	 electric 	 ity 	 	is	what	it	 take 	 s 	 	to	run	a	city	,	or	a	city	planet	.
so	far	there	is	 on 	 ly 	 	three	 source 	 s 	 	of	 base 	 load 	 	 electric 	 ity 	 	:	coal	,	some	gas	,	nuclear	and	hydro	.
of	 t 	 hose 	 	,	 on 	 ly 	 	nuclear	and	hydro	are	green	.
coal	is	what	is	 caus 	 ing 	 	the	climate	 problem 	 s 	 	.
and	 every 	 one 	 	will	keep	 burn 	 ing 	 	it	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	so	cheap	,	 un 	 til 	 	 government 	 s 	 	make	it	expensive	.
wind	and	solar	ca	n't	help	,	 be 	 cause 	 	so	far	we	do	n't	have	a	way	to	store	that	energy	.	so	with	hydro	 max 	 ed 	 	out	,	coal	and	lose	the	climate	,	or	nuclear	,	which	is	the	current	 oper 	 ating 	 	low	-	carbon	source	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	 s 	 ave 	 	the	climate	.
and	if	we	can	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	get	good	solar	in	space	,	that	 al 	 so 	 	could	help	.
 be 	 cause 	 	remember	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 drive 	 s 	 	the	 prosper 	 ity 	 	in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	in	the	 village 	 s 	 	and	in	the	cities	.
so	,	between	coal	and	nuclear	,	 compar 	 e 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	waste	 product 	 s 	 	.
if	all	of	the	 electric 	 ity 	 	you	used	in	your	 life 	 time 	 	was	nuclear	,	the	amount	of	waste	that	would	be	 add 	 ed 	 	up	would	fit	in	a	 co 	 ke 	 	can	.
 where 	 a 	 s 	 	a	coal	-	 burn 	 ing 	 	plant	,	a	normal	one	gigawatt	coal	plant	,	 burn 	 s 	 	80	rail	 car 	 s 	 	of	coal	a	day	,
each	car	 hav 	 ing 	 	100	 ton 	 s 	 	.
and	it	 put 	 s 	 	18	thousand	 ton 	 s 	 	of	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	in	the	air	.
so	and	then	when	you	 compar 	 e 	 	the	 life 	 time 	 	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	of	these	 vari 	 ous 	 	energy	 form 	 s 	 	,
nuclear	is	about	even	with	solar	and	wind	,	and	 a 	 head 	 	of	solar	--
oh	,	i	'm	sorry	--	with	hydro	and	wind	,	and	 a 	 head 	 	of	solar	.
and	 do 	 es 	 	nuclear	 re 	 ally 	 	compete	with	coal	?
just	ask	the	coal	 min 	 ers 	 	in	australia	.	that	's	where	you	see	some	of	the	source	,	not	from	my	fellow	 environment 	 alist 	 s 	 	,	but	from	people	who	feel	 threaten 	 ed 	 	by	nuclear	power	.
well	the	good	news	is	that	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	,	but	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	the	whole	world	,	is	 bus 	 y 	 	building	,	and	 start 	 ing 	 	to	build	,	nuclear	 reactor 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	good	for	the	atmosphere	.
it	's	good	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 prosper 	 ity 	 	.
i	want	to	point	out	one	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	,	which	is	that	 environment 	 alist 	 s 	 	like	the	thing	we	call	micropower	.
it	's	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	,	i	do	n't	know	,	local	solar	and	wind	and	cogeneration	,	and	good	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	.
but	 frank 	 ly 	 	micro	-	 reactor 	 s 	 	which	are	just	now	coming	on	,	might	serve	even	better	.	the	russians	,	who	 start 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	are	building	 float 	 ing 	 	 reactor 	 s 	 	,	for	 the 	 ir 	 	new	 pass 	 age 	 	,	where	the	ice	is	 melt 	 ing 	 	,	north	of	russia	.
and	they	're	selling	these	 float 	 ing 	 	 reactor 	 s 	 	,	 on 	 ly 	 	35	 megawatt 	 s 	 	,	to	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	.
here	's	the	design	of	an	early	one	from	toshiba	.
it	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	say	,	to	take	a	25	-	megawatt	,	25	million	 watt 	 s 	 	,	and	you	 compar 	 e 	 	it	to	the	standard	big	iron	of	an	 ordin 	 ary 	 	westinghouse	or	ariva	,	which	is	1.2	,	1.6	billion	 watt 	 s 	 	.
these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	way	 small 	 er 	 	.	they	're	much	more	 adapt 	 able 	 	.
here	's	an	american	design	from	lawrence	livermore	lab	.
here	's	 an 	 other 	 	american	design	that	came	out	of	los	alamos	,	and	is	now	commercial	.
 al 	 most 	 	all	of	these	are	not	 on 	 ly 	 	small	,	they	are	 pro 	 life 	 ration 	 	-	proof	.
they	're	 typical 	 ly 	 	buried	in	the	ground	.
and	the	 innov 	 ation 	 	is	moving	 ver 	 y 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	.
so	i	think	microreactors	is	going	to	be	 import 	 ant 	 	for	the	future	.
in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 pro 	 life 	 ration 	 	,	nuclear	energy	 ha 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	more	to	dismantle	nuclear	 weapon 	 s 	 	than	any	other	activity	.
and	that	's	why	10	percent	of	the	 electric 	 ity 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	20	percent	of	 electric 	 ity 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	nuclear	.
half	of	that	is	coming	from	 dismantle 	 d 	 	 war 	 head 	 s 	 	from	russia	,
soon	to	be	 join 	 ed 	 	by	our	 dismantle 	 d 	 	 war 	 head 	 s 	 	.
and	so	i	would	like	to	see	the	gnep	program	,	that	was	 develop 	 ed 	 	in	the	bush	 administr 	 ation 	 	,	go	forward	 aggress 	 ively 	 	.
and	i	was	glad	to	see	that	 p 	 resident 	 	obama	 support 	 ed 	 	the	nuclear	fuel	bank	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	when	he	spoke	in	prague	the	other	week	.
one	more	subject	.	 genetic 	 ally 	 	engineered	food	 crop 	 s 	 	,	in	my	view	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	biologist	,	have	no	reason	to	be	controversial	.
my	fellow	 environment 	 alist 	 s 	 	,	on	 th 	 is 	 	subject	,	have	 be 	 en 	 	irrational	,	anti	-	scientific	,	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 harm 	 ful 	 	.
 de 	 spite 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	best	 effort 	 s 	 	,	 genetic 	 ally 	 	engineered	 crop 	 s 	 	are	the	most	 rapid 	 ly 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	 agricultur 	 al 	 	 innov 	 ation 	 	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
they	're	good	for	the	environment	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 en 	 able 	 	no	-	till	 farm 	 ing 	 	,	which	 leav 	 es 	 	the	 s 	 oil 	 	in	place	,	 get 	 ting 	 	 health 	 ier 	 	from	year	to	year	--
slso	 keep 	 s 	 	less	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	going	from	the	 s 	 oil 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	atmosphere	.
they	 reduc 	 e 	 	 pest 	 icide 	 	use	.
and	they	 in 	 crease 	 	yield	,	which	 allow 	 s 	 	you	to	have	your	 agricultur 	 al 	 	area	be	 small 	 er 	 	,
and	 there 	 fore 	 	more	wild	area	is	 free 	 d 	 	up	.
by	the	way	,	 th 	 is 	 	map	from	2006	is	out	of	date	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 show 	 s 	 	africa	still	under	the	thumb	of	greenpeace	,	and	 friend 	 s 	 	of	the	earth	from	europe	,
and	they	're	 final 	 ly 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	out	from	under	that	.
and	 bio 	 tech 	 	is	moving	 rapid 	 ly 	 	in	africa	,	at	last	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	moral	issue	.
the	nuffield	council	on	bioethics	met	on	 th 	 is 	 	issue	twice	in	great	detail	and	 s 	 aid 	 	it	is	a	moral	 imper 	 ative 	 	to	make	 genetic 	 ally 	 	engineered	 crop 	 s 	 	 read 	 ily 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	.
 s 	 peaking 	 	of	 imper 	 ative 	 s 	 	,	 geo 	 engineer 	 ing 	 	is	taboo	now	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	in	government	 circle 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	i	think	there	was	a	darpa	 meet 	 ing 	 	on	it	a	couple	of	 week 	 s 	 	ago	,
but	it	will	be	on	your	plate	--	not	 th 	 is 	 	year	but	 pre 	 tty 	 	soon	,
 be 	 cause 	 	some	harsh	 real 	 ization 	 s 	 	are	coming	 a 	 long 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	list	of	them	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	the	news	is	going	to	keep	 get 	 ting 	 	more	 scar 	 y 	 	.
there	will	be	 event 	 s 	 	,	like	35,000	people	 dy 	 ing 	 	of	a	heat	wave	,	which	 happen 	 ed 	 	a	while	back	.
like	cyclones	coming	up	 to 	 ward 	 	bangladesh	.
like	 war 	 s 	 	over	water	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	in	the	indus	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 event 	 s 	 	keep	 happen 	 ing 	 	we	're	going	to	say	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	what	can	we	do	about	that	 re 	 ally 	 	?	``
but	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	little	problem	with	 geo 	 engineer 	 ing 	 	:
what	body	is	going	to	decide
who	 get 	 s 	 	to	engineer	?	how	much	they	do	?	where	they	do	it	?
 be 	 cause 	 	 every 	 body 	 	is	 down 	 stream 	 	,	 down 	 wind 	 	of	 what 	 ever 	 	is	 d 	 one 	 	.
and	if	we	just	taboo	it	 complete 	 ly 	 	we	could	lose	 civil 	 ization 	 	.
but	if	we	just	say	``	ok	,	 chin 	 a 	 	,	you	're	 worri 	 ed 	 	,	you	go	 a 	 head 	 	.
you	geoengineer	your	way	.	we	'll	geoengineer	our	way	.	``
that	would	be	 consider 	 ed 	 	an	act	of	war	by	both	 nation 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 diploma 	 cy 	 	coming	 a 	 long 	 	.
i	should	say	,	it	is	more	practical	than	people	think	.	here	is	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	that	 climato 	 logists 	 	like	a	lot	,
one	of	the	 dozen 	 s 	 	of	 geo 	 engineer 	 ing 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	one	came	from	the	sulfur	 di 	 oxide 	 	from	mount	pinatubo	in	1991	--
 cool 	 ed 	 	the	earth	by	half	a	degree	.
there	was	so	much	ice	in	1992	,	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	year	,	that	there	was	a	 bump 	 er 	 	crop	of	polar	bear	 cub 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	known	 a 	 s 	 	the	pinatubo	 cub 	 s 	 	.
to	put	sulfur	 di 	 oxide 	 	in	the	 strato 	 sphere 	 	would	cost	on	the	order	of	a	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	.
that	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	,	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	all	of	the	other	 thing 	 s 	 	we	may	be	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	about	energy	.
just	to	run	by	 an 	 other 	 	one	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	plan	to	 bright 	 en 	 	the	reflectance	of	ocean	 cloud 	 s 	 	,	by	atomizing	 sea 	 water 	 	;
that	would	 bright 	 en 	 	the	albedo	of	the	whole	planet	.
a	nice	one	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	can	happen	 lot 	 s 	 	of	little	ways	in	 lot 	 s 	 	of	little	 place 	 s 	 	,
is	by	 copy 	 ing 	 	the	ancient	amazon	 in 	 d 	 ians 	 	who	made	good	 agricultur 	 al 	 	 s 	 oil 	 	by	pyrolizing	,	 s 	 mold 	 er 	 ing 	 	,	plant	waste	,
and	biochar	 fix 	 es 	 	large	 quant 	 ities 	 	of	carbon	while	it	's	 improv 	 ing 	 	the	 s 	 oil 	 	.	so	here	is	where	we	are	.
 no 	 bel 	 	prize	-	winning	 climato 	 logist 	 	paul	crutzen	 call 	 s 	 	our	 geo 	 logical 	 	era	the	anthropocene	,	the	human	-	 dominate 	 d 	 	era	.	we	are	 s 	 tuck 	 	with	 it 	 s 	 	 oblig 	 ations 	 	.
in	the	whole	earth	catalog	,	my	first	 word 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	,	``	we	are	 a 	 s 	 	 god 	 s 	 	,	and	might	 a 	 s 	 	well	get	good	at	it	.	``	the	first	 word 	 s 	 	of	whole	earth	discipline	are	,	``	we	are	 a 	 s 	 	 god 	 s 	 	,	and	have	to	get	good	at	it	.	``	thank	you	.
