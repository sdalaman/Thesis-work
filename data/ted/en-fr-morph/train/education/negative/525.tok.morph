the	first	half	of	the	20th	century	was	an	absolute	disaster	in	human	 af 	 fair 	 s 	 	,	a	cataclysm	.
we	had	the	first	world	war	,	the	great	 depress 	 ion 	 	,	the	second	world	war	and	the	rise	of	the	 commun 	 ist 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	.
and	each	one	of	these	 force 	 s 	 	split	the	world	,	 to 	 re 	 	the	world	 a 	 part 	 	,	 divid 	 ed 	 	the	world	.
and	they	threw	up	 wall 	 s 	 	--	 politic 	 al 	 	 wall 	 s 	 	,	trade	 wall 	 s 	 	,	 transport 	 ation 	 	 wall 	 s 	 	,	communication	 wall 	 s 	 	,	iron	 cur 	 tain 	 s 	 	--
which	 divid 	 ed 	 	 people 	 s 	 	and	 nation 	 s 	 	.
it	was	 on 	 ly 	 	in	the	second	half	of	the	20th	century	that	we	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	to	pull	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	abyss	.
trade	 wall 	 s 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	to	come	tumbling	down	.
here	are	some	data	on	 ta 	 riff 	 s 	 	:	 start 	 ing 	 	at	40	percent	,	coming	down	to	less	than	5	percent	.
we	 global 	 ized 	 	the	world	.	and	what	 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	?
it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	we	 extend 	 ed 	 	 co 	 operation 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	national	 bound 	 aries 	 	;
we	made	the	world	more	 co 	 operative 	 	.
 transport 	 ation 	 	 wall 	 s 	 	came	tumbling	down	.
you	know	in	1950	the	typical	ship	carried	5,000	to	10,000	 ton 	 s 	 	worth	of	 good 	 s 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	a	 contain 	 er 	 	ship	can	carry	150,000	 ton 	 s 	 	;
it	can	be	 mann 	 ed 	 	with	a	 small 	 er 	 	crew	;	and	 un 	 load 	 ed 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	than	ever	before	.
communication	 wall 	 s 	 	,	i	do	n't	have	to	tell	you	--	the	 inter 	 net 	 	--	have	come	tumbling	down	.
and	of	course	the	iron	 cur 	 tain 	 s 	 	,	 politic 	 al 	 	 wall 	 s 	 	have	come	tumbling	down	.
now	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	tremendous	for	the	world	.
trade	 ha 	 s 	 	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	.
here	is	just	a	little	bit	of	data	.
in	1990	,	 export 	 s 	 	from	 chin 	 a 	 	to	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	:	15	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
by	2007	:	over	300	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	most	 remark 	 ably 	 	,	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	21st	century	,	 re 	 ally 	 	for	the	first	time	in	modern	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	growth	 extend 	 ed 	 	to	 al 	 most 	 	all	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	world	.
so	 chin 	 a 	 	,	i	've	 al 	 ready 	 	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	,	 begin 	 ning 	 	around	1978	,	around	the	time	of	the	death	of	mao	,	growth	--	ten	percent	a	year	.
year	after	year	after	year	,	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	.
never	before	in	human	 histo 	 ry 	 	have	so	 man 	 y 	 	people	 be 	 en 	 	raised	out	of	 s 	 uch 	 	great	poverty	 a 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	 chin 	 a 	 	.
 chin 	 a 	 	is	the	world	's	 great 	 est 	 	anti	-	poverty	program	over	the	last	three	 decade 	 s 	 	.
india	,	 start 	 ing 	 	a	little	bit	 lat 	 er 	 	,	but	in	1990	,	 be 	 get 	 ting 	 	tremendous	growth	.
 income 	 s 	 	at	that	time	less	than	$	1,000	per	year	.
and	over	the	next	18	 year 	 s 	 	have	 al 	 most 	 	 triple 	 d 	 	.
growth	of	six	percent	a	year	.	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	.
now	africa	,	sub	-	saharan	africa	--	sub	-	saharan	africa	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	the	area	of	the	world	most	resistant	to	growth	.
and	we	can	see	the	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	of	africa	in	the	first	few	 bar 	 s 	 	here	.
growth	was	negative	.
people	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 poor 	 er 	 	than	 the 	 ir 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	,
and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	even	 poor 	 er 	 	than	 the 	 ir 	 	 grand 	 parent 	 s 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	.
but	at	the	end	of	the	20th	century	,	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	21st	century	,	we	saw	growth	in	africa	.
and	i	think	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	'll	see	,	there	's	 reason 	 s 	 	for	 optim 	 ism 	 	,
 be 	 cause 	 	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	the	best	is	yet	to	come	.
now	why	.	on	the	cutting	edge	 to 	 day 	 	it	's	new	 idea 	 s 	 	which	are	 driv 	 ing 	 	growth	.
and	by	that	i	mean	it	's	 product 	 s 	 	for	which	the	research	and	 develop 	 ment 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	high	,	and	the	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	are	low	.
more	than	ever	before	it	is	these	 type 	 s 	 	of	 idea 	 s 	 	which	are	 driv 	 ing 	 	growth	on	the	cutting	edge	.
now	 idea 	 s 	 	have	 th 	 is 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 proper 	 ty 	 	.
thomas	jefferson	,	i	think	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 express 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	well	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	he	who	 receiv 	 es 	 	an	idea	from	me	 receiv 	 es 	 	 instruct 	 ion 	 	 him 	 self 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	 less 	 en 	 ing 	 	mine	.
 a 	 s 	 	he	who	 light 	 s 	 	his	candle	at	mine	 receiv 	 es 	 	light	 with 	 out 	 	 dark 	 en 	 ing 	 	me	.	or	to	put	it	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	:	one	apple	 feed 	 s 	 	one	man	,	but	an	idea	can	feed	the	world	.	``
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	new	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 practical 	 ly 	 	not	new	to	tedsters	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 practical 	 ly 	 	the	model	of	ted	.
but	what	is	new	is	that	the	 great 	 er 	 	function	of	 idea 	 s 	 	is	going	to	drive	growth	even	more	than	ever	before	.
 th 	 is 	 	 provide 	 s 	 	a	reason	why	trade	and	 global 	 ization 	 	are	even	more	 import 	 ant 	 	,	more	 power 	 ful 	 	than	ever	before	,	and	are	going	to	 in 	 crease 	 	growth	more	than	ever	before	.
and	to	explain	why	 th 	 is 	 	is	so	,	i	have	a	question	.	suppose	that	there	are	two	 disease 	 s 	 	:
one	of	them	is	rare	,	the	other	one	is	common	,
but	if	they	are	not	 treat 	 ed 	 	they	are	 equal 	 ly 	 	severe	.
if	you	had	to	 choos 	 e 	 	,	which	would	you	 ra 	 ther 	 	have	:
the	common	disease	or	the	rare	disease	?
common	,	the	common	--	i	think	that	's	 absolute 	 ly 	 	right	,
and	why	?	 be 	 cause 	 	there	are	more	 drug 	 s 	 	to	treat	common	 disease 	 s 	 	than	there	are	to	treat	rare	 disease 	 s 	 	.
the	reason	for	 th 	 is 	 	is	 incentive 	 s 	 	.
it	 cost 	 s 	 	about	the	same	to	produce	a	new	drug	 whet 	 her 	 	that	drug	 treat 	 s 	 	1,000	people	,	100,000	people	,	or	a	million	people	.
but	the	 revenue 	 s 	 	are	much	 great 	 er 	 	if	the	drug	 treat 	 s 	 	a	million	people	.
so	the	 incentive 	 s 	 	are	much	 large 	 r 	 	to	produce	 drug 	 s 	 	which	treat	more	people	.
to	put	 th 	 is 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	:	 large 	 r 	 	 market 	 s 	 	 s 	 ave 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	 mis 	 ery 	 	 tru 	 ly 	 	 do 	 es 	 	love	company	.
now	think	about	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	:	if	 chin 	 a 	 	and	india	 we 	 re 	 	 a 	 s 	 	rich	 a 	 s 	 	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	is	 to 	 day 	 	,	the	market	for	cancer	 drug 	 s 	 	would	be	eight	 time 	 s 	 	 large 	 r 	 	than	it	is	now	.
now	we	are	not	there	yet	,	but	it	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	other	 count 	 ries 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 rich 	 er 	 	the	demand	for	these	 pharmaceutical 	 s 	 	is	going	to	 in 	 crease 	 	 tremendous 	 ly 	 	.
and	that	 mean 	 s 	 	an	 in 	 crease 	 	incentive	to	do	research	and	 develop 	 ment 	 	,	which	 benefit 	 s 	 	 every 	 one 	 	in	the	world	.
 large 	 r 	 	 market 	 s 	 	 in 	 crease 	 	the	incentive	to	produce	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 idea 	 s 	 	,
 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	 soft 	 ware 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	a	computer	chip	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	a	new	design	.
for	the	hollywood	people	in	the	audience	,	 th 	 is 	 	even	 explain 	 s 	 	why	action	 movie 	 s 	 	have	 large 	 r 	 	 budget 	 s 	 	than	 come 	 dies 	 	:
it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	action	 movie 	 s 	 	 transl 	 ate 	 	 eas 	 ier 	 	 in 	 to 	 	other	 language 	 s 	 	and	other	 culture 	 s 	 	,
so	the	market	for	 t 	 hose 	 	 movie 	 s 	 	is	 large 	 r 	 	.
people	are	 will 	 ing 	 	to	invest	more	,	and	the	 budget 	 s 	 	are	 large 	 r 	 	.
 al 	 right 	 	.	well	if	 large 	 r 	 	 market 	 s 	 	 in 	 crease 	 	the	incentive	to	produce	new	 idea 	 s 	 	,	how	do	we	 maxim 	 ize 	 	that	incentive	?
it	's	by	 hav 	 ing 	 	one	world	market	,	by	 global 	 izing 	 	the	world	.
the	way	i	like	to	put	 th 	 is 	 	is	:	one	idea	.	 idea 	 s 	 	are	 me 	 ant 	 	to	be	 share 	 d 	 	,	so	one	idea	can	serve	one	world	,	one	market	.
one	idea	,	one	world	,	one	market	.
well	how	else	can	we	create	new	 idea 	 s 	 	?
that	's	one	reason	.
globalize	trade	.
how	else	can	we	create	new	 idea 	 s 	 	?
well	,	more	idea	 creator 	 s 	 	.
now	idea	 creator 	 s 	 	,	they	come	from	all	 walk 	 s 	 	of	life	.
 artist 	 s 	 	and	 innov 	 ators 	 	--	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	people	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	stage	.
i	'm	going	to	focus	on	 scientist 	 s 	 	and	 engineer 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	have	some	data	on	that	,	and	i	'm	a	data	person	.
now	,	 to 	 day 	 	,	less	than	one	-	tenth	of	one	percent	of	the	world	's	population	are	 scientist 	 s 	 	and	 engineer 	 s 	 	.
the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	an	idea	 lead 	 er 	 	.
a	large	fraction	of	 t 	 hose 	 	people	are	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
but	the	u.s.	is	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	idea	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	.
and	for	that	i	am	 ver 	 y 	 	 grat 	 e 	 ful 	 	.
that	is	a	good	thing	.
it	is	fortunate	that	we	are	 be 	 coming 	 	less	of	an	idea	 lead 	 er 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	for	too	long	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	and	a	 hand 	 ful 	 	of	other	 develop 	 ed 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	have	 shoulder 	 ed 	 	the	entire	burden	of	research	and	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
but	consider	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	:	if	the	world	 a 	 s 	 	a	whole	 we 	 re 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 wealth 	 y 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	is	now	there	would	be	more	than	five	 time 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 scientist 	 s 	 	and	 engineer 	 s 	 	 con 	 trib 	 uting 	 	to	 idea 	 s 	 	which	benefit	 every 	 one 	 	,	which	are	 share 	 d 	 	by	 every 	 one 	 	.
i	think	of	the	great	indian	 mathematic 	 ian 	 	,	ramanujan	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	ramanujans	are	there	in	india	 to 	 day 	 	 toil 	 ing 	 	in	the	 field 	 s 	 	,	 bare 	 ly 	 	able	to	feed	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	when	they	could	be	 feed 	 ing 	 	the	world	?
now	we	're	not	there	yet	.
but	it	is	going	to	happen	in	 th 	 is 	 	century	.
the	real	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	of	the	last	century	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	if	you	think	about	the	world	's	population	 a 	 s 	 	a	giant	computer	,	a	 massive 	 ly 	 	parallel	processor	,	then	the	great	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	that	 billion 	 s 	 	of	our	 processor 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	off	line	.
but	in	 th 	 is 	 	century	 chin 	 a 	 	is	coming	on	line	.
india	is	coming	on	line	.
africa	is	coming	on	line	.
we	will	see	an	einstein	in	africa	in	 th 	 is 	 	century	.
here	is	just	some	data	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 chin 	 a 	 	.
1996	:	less	than	one	million	new	university	 student 	 s 	 	in	 chin 	 a 	 	per	year	;
2006	:	over	five	million	.
now	think	what	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	we	all	benefit	when	 an 	 other 	 	country	 get 	 s 	 	rich	.
we	should	not	fear	other	 count 	 ries 	 	 be 	 coming 	 	 wealth 	 y 	 	.
that	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	should	embrace	--	a	 wealth 	 y 	 	 chin 	 a 	 	,	a	 wealth 	 y 	 	india	,	a	 wealth 	 y 	 	africa	.
we	need	a	 great 	 er 	 	demand	for	 idea 	 s 	 	--	 t 	 hose 	 	 large 	 r 	 	 market 	 s 	 	i	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 ear 	 lier 	 	--	and	a	 great 	 er 	 	supply	of	 idea 	 s 	 	for	the	world	.
now	you	can	see	some	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	why	i	'm	 optimist 	 ic 	 	.
 global 	 ization 	 	is	increasing	the	demand	for	 idea 	 s 	 	,	the	incentive	to	create	new	 idea 	 s 	 	.
 invest 	 ments 	 	in	education	are	increasing	the	supply	of	new	 idea 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	if	you	look	at	world	 histo 	 ry 	 	you	can	see	some	 reason 	 s 	 	for	 optim 	 ism 	 	.
from	about	the	 begin 	 ning 	 s 	 	of	 human 	 ity 	 	to	1500	:	zero	economic	growth	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
1500	to	1800	:	 may 	 be 	 	a	little	bit	of	economic	growth	,
but	less	in	a	century	than	you	expect	to	see	in	a	year	 to 	 day 	 	.
1900s	:	 may 	 be 	 	one	percent	.
 t 	 went 	 ieth 	 	century	:	a	little	bit	over	two	percent	.
twenty	-	first	century	could	 eas 	 ily 	 	be	3.3	,	even	 high 	 er 	 	percent	.
even	at	that	rate	,	by	2100	average	gdp	per	capita	in	the	world	will	be	$	200,000	.
that	's	not	u.s.	gdp	per	capita	,	which	will	be	over	a	million	,
but	world	gdp	per	capita	--	$	200,000	.
that	's	not	that	far	.
we	wo	n't	make	it	.
but	some	of	our	 grand 	 children 	 	 prob 	 ably 	 	will	.
and	i	should	say	,	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ra 	 ther 	 	modest	 predict 	 ion 	 	.
in	kurzweilian	 term 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	 gloom 	 y 	 	.
in	kurzweilian	 term 	 s 	 	i	'm	like	the	eeyore	of	economic	growth	.
 al 	 right 	 	what	about	 problem 	 s 	 	?
what	about	a	great	 depress 	 ion 	 	?
here	is	gdp	per	capita	from	1900	to	1929	.
now	let	's	imagine	that	you	 we 	 re 	 	an	economist	in	1929	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 fore 	 cast 	 	future	growth	for	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	not	 know 	 ing 	 	that	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	was	about	to	go	off	a	cliff	,
not	 know 	 ing 	 	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	about	to	enter	the	 great 	 est 	 	economic	disaster	 certain 	 ly 	 	in	the	20th	century	.
what	would	you	have	 predict 	 ed 	 	,	not	 know 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	?
if	you	had	based	your	 predict 	 ion 	 	,	your	 fore 	 cast 	 	on	1900	to	1929	you	'd	have	 predict 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
if	you	'd	 be 	 en 	 	a	little	more	 optimist 	 ic 	 	--	say	,	based	 up 	 on 	 	the	 roar 	 ing 	 	twenties	--	you	'd	have	 s 	 aid 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	what	 actual 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	?
we	went	off	a	cliff	but	we	 re 	 cover 	 ed 	 	.
in	fact	in	the	second	half	of	the	20th	century	growth	was	even	 high 	 er 	 	than	 any 	 thing 	 	you	would	have	 predict 	 ed 	 	based	 up 	 on 	 	the	first	half	of	the	20th	century	.
so	growth	can	wash	away	even	what	 appear 	 s 	 	to	be	a	great	 depress 	 ion 	 	.
 al 	 right 	 	.	what	else	?
oil	.	oil	.	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	big	 top 	 ic 	 	.
when	i	was	writing	up	my	 note 	 s 	 	oil	was	$	140	per	barrel	.
so	people	 we 	 re 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	a	question	.	they	 we 	 re 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	is	 chin 	 a 	 	 drink 	 ing 	 	our	 milk 	 shake 	 	?	``
and	there	is	some	truth	to	 th 	 is 	 	,	in	the	sense	that	we	have	 some 	 thing 	 	of	a	 fin 	 ite 	 	resource	,
and	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	growth	is	going	to	push	up	demand	for	that	.
but	i	think	i	do	n't	have	to	tell	 th 	 is 	 	audience	that	a	 high 	 er 	 	price	of	oil	is	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	a	bad	thing	.
 more 	 over 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 every 	 one 	 	 know 	 s 	 	,	look	--	it	's	energy	,	not	oil	,	which	 count 	 s 	 	.
and	 high 	 er 	 	oil	 price 	 s 	 	mean	a	 great 	 er 	 	incentive	to	invest	in	energy	r	&	d	.
you	can	see	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	data	.
 a 	 s 	 	oil	 price 	 s 	 	go	up	,	energy	 patent 	 s 	 	go	up	.
the	world	is	much	better	 equi 	 pped 	 	to	 over 	 come 	 	an	 in 	 crease 	 	in	the	price	of	oil	 to 	 day 	 	,	than	ever	in	the	past	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	what	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	.
one	idea	,	one	world	,	one	market	.
so	i	'm	 optimist 	 ic 	 
so	long	 a 	 s 	 	we	hew	to	these	two	 idea 	 s 	 	:	to	keep	 global 	 izing 	 	world	 market 	 s 	 	,	keep	 extend 	 ing 	 	 co 	 operation 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	national	 bound 	 aries 	 	,	and	keep	 invest 	 ing 	 	in	education	.
now	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	role	to	play	in	 th 	 is 	 	:	to	keep	our	education	system	 global 	 ized 	 	,	to	keep	our	education	system	open	to	 student 	 s 	 	from	all	over	the	world	,	 be 	 cause 	 	our	education	system	is	the	candle	that	other	 student 	 s 	 	come	to	light	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 candle 	 s 	 	.
now	remember	here	what	jefferson	 s 	 aid 	 	.
jefferson	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	when	they	come	and	light	 the 	 ir 	 	 candle 	 s 	 	at	 our 	 s 	 	,	they	gain	light	,	and	we	are	not	 dark 	 ened 	 	.	``
but	jefferson	was	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	right	,	was	he	?
 be 	 cause 	 	the	truth	is	,	when	they	light	 the 	 ir 	 	 candle 	 s 	 	at	 our 	 s 	 	,	there	is	twice	 a 	 s 	 	much	light	 avail 	 able 	 	for	 every 	 one 	 	.
so	my	view	is	:	be	 optimist 	 ic 	 	.
spread	the	 idea 	 s 	 	.	spread	the	light	.
thank	you	.
