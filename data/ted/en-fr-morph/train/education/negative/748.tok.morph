can	 geo 	 graphic 	 	information	make	you	 health 	 y 	 	?
in	2001	i	got	hit	by	a	train	.
my	train	was	a	heart	attack	.
i	found	 my 	 self 	 	in	a	hospital	in	an	intensive	-	care	ward	,	 recupe 	 rating 	 	from	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	.
and	i	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 real 	 ized 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	:	that	i	was	 complete 	 ly 	 	in	the	dark	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	my	 question 	 s 	 	,	``	well	,	why	me	?	``
``	why	now	?	``	``	why	here	?	``
``	could	my	doctor	have	 war 	 ned 	 	me	?	``
so	,	what	i	want	to	do	here	in	the	few	 minute 	 s 	 	i	have	with	you	is	 re 	 ally 	 	talk	about	what	is	the	formula	for	life	and	good	health	.
 genetic 	 s 	 	,	 life 	 style 	 	and	environment	.
that	's	going	to	sort	of	contain	our	 risk 	 s 	 	,	and	if	we	manage	 t 	 hose 	 	 risk 	 s 	 	we	're	going	to	live	a	good	life	and	a	good	 health 	 y 	 	life	.
well	,	i	understand	the	 genetic 	 s 	 	and	 life 	 style 	 	part	.
and	you	know	why	i	understand	that	?
 be 	 cause 	 	my	 physician 	 s 	 	 constant 	 ly 	 	ask	me	 question 	 s 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
have	you	ever	had	to	fill	out	 t 	 hose 	 	long	,	legal	-	 s 	 ize 	 	 form 	 s 	 	in	your	doctor	's	 off 	 ice 	 	?
i	mean	,	if	you	're	 luck 	 y 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	you	get	to	do	it	more	than	once	,	right	?
do	it	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	.	and	they	ask	you	 question 	 s 	 	about	your	 life 	 style 	 	and	your	family	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	your	 medic 	 ation 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	your	 sur 	 gical 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	your	 alle 	 rgy 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	...	did	i	forget	any	 histo 	 ry 	 	?
but	 th 	 is 	 	part	of	the	 equ 	 ation 	 	i	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	get	,
and	i	do	n't	think	my	 physician 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	get	 th 	 is 	 	part	of	the	 equ 	 ation 	 	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	,	my	environment	?
well	,	it	can	mean	a	lot	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	my	life	.	these	are	my	life	 place 	 s 	 	.
we	all	have	these	.
while	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	i	'd	like	you	to	 al 	 so 	 	be	 think 	 ing 	 	about	:	how	 man 	 y 	 	 place 	 s 	 	have	you	lived	?
just	think	about	that	,	you	know	,	wander	through	your	life	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	you	 real 	 ize 	 	that	you	 s 	 pend 	 	it	in	a	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	different	 place 	 s 	 	.
you	 s 	 pend 	 	it	at	rest	and	you	 s 	 pend 	 	it	at	work	.
and	if	you	're	like	me	,	you	're	in	an	 air 	 plane 	 	a	good	 port 	 ion 	 	of	your	time	 travel 	 ing 	 	some	place	.
so	,	it	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	simple	when	 some 	 body 	 	 ask 	 s 	 	you	,	``	where	do	you	live	,	where	do	you	work	,	and	where	do	you	 s 	 pend 	 	all	your	time	?
and	where	do	you	 ex 	 pose 	 	 your 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	 risk 	 s 	 	that	 may 	 be 	 	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	you	do	n't	even	see	?	``
well	,	when	i	have	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	on	 my 	 self 	 	,	i	 al 	 ways 	 	come	to	the	 con 	 clusion 	 	that	i	 s 	 pend 	 	about	75	percent	of	my	time	 relat 	 ively 	 	in	a	small	number	of	 place 	 s 	 	.
and	i	do	n't	wander	far	from	that	place	for	a	 major 	 ity 	 	of	my	time	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	i	'm	an	 extens 	 ive 	 	global	 trek 	 ker 	 	.
now	,	i	'm	going	to	take	you	on	a	little	journey	here	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	off	in	scranton	,	pennsylvania	.
i	do	n't	know	if	 any 	 body 	 	might	hail	from	 north 	 eastern 	 	pennsylvania	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	i	 s 	 pent 	 	my	first	19	 year 	 s 	 	with	my	little	young	 lung 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	 breath 	 ing 	 	high	 concent 	 ration 	 s 	 	here	of	sulfur	 di 	 oxide 	 	,	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	and	 m 	 ethane 	 	gas	,	in	 un 	 equal 	 	 quant 	 ities 	 	--	19	 year 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	if	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	in	that	part	of	the	country	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 t 	 hose 	 	 pile 	 s 	 	of	 burn 	 ing 	 	,	 s 	 mold 	 er 	 ing 	 	coal	waste	look	like	.
so	then	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	 leav 	 e 	 	that	part	of	the	world	,
and	i	was	going	to	go	to	the	mid	-	west	.
ok	,	so	i	 end 	 ed 	 	up	in	louisville	,	kentucky	.
well	,	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	be	 neighbor 	 s 	 	to	a	place	 call 	 ed 	 	rubbertown	.
they	 manufactur 	 e 	 	 plastic 	 s 	 	.	they	use	large	 quant 	 ities 	 	 chlorop 	 rene 	 	and	 be 	 n 	 zen 	 e 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	i	 s 	 pent 	 	25	 year 	 s 	 	,	in	my	middle	-	age	 lung 	 s 	 	now	,	 breath 	 ing 	 	 vari 	 ous 	 	 concent 	 ration 	 s 	 	of	that	.
and	on	a	clear	day	it	 al 	 ways 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	so	you	never	saw	it	.
it	was	 insid 	 ious 	 	and	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
then	i	 decide 	 d 	 	i	had	to	get	 re 	 ally 	 	smart	,	i	would	take	 th 	 is 	 	job	in	the	west	coast	.
and	i	 move 	 d 	 	to	redlands	california	.
 ver 	 y 	 	nice	,	and	there	my	 old 	 er 	 	,	senior	 lung 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	like	to	call	them	,	i	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	 p 	 articulate 	 	matter	,	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	and	 ver 	 y 	 	high	 dose 	 s 	 	of	 o 	 zone 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?	 al 	 most 	 	like	the	highest	in	the	nation	.
 al 	 right 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	on	a	good	day	.
if	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	there	,	you	know	what	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	.
so	,	what	's	wrong	with	 th 	 is 	 	picture	?
well	,	the	picture	is	,	there	is	a	huge	gap	here	.
the	one	thing	that	never	 happen 	 s 	 	in	my	doctor	's	 off 	 ice 	 	:	they	never	ask	me	about	my	place	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
no	doctor	,	can	i	remember	,	ever	 ask 	 ing 	 	me	,	``	where	have	you	lived	?	``
they	have	n't	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	what	kind	of	the	quality	of	the	 drink 	 ing 	 	water	that	i	put	in	my	mouth	or	the	food	that	i	 ing 	 est 	 	 in 	 to 	 	my	stomach	.
they	 re 	 ally 	 	do	n't	do	that	.	it	's	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	.
look	at	the	kind	of	data	that	's	 avail 	 able 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	data	's	from	all	over	the	world	--	 count 	 ries 	 	 s 	 pend 	 	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	 invest 	 ing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	research	.
now	,	i	've	 circle 	 d 	 	the	 place 	 s 	 	where	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	.
well	,	by	design	,	if	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	have	a	heart	attack	i	'd	 be 	 en 	 	in	the	right	 place 	 s 	 	.	right	?
so	,	how	 man 	 y 	 	people	are	in	the	white	?
how	 man 	 y 	 	people	in	the	room	have	 s 	 pent 	 	the	 major 	 ity 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	life	in	the	white	space	?
 any 	 body 	 	?	boy	you	're	 luck 	 y 	 	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	have	 s 	 pent 	 	it	in	the	red	 place 	 s 	 	?
oh	,	not	so	 luck 	 y 	 	.
there	are	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 map 	 s 	 	that	are	 dis 	 play 	 ed 	 	in	 atlas 	 es 	 	all	over	the	world	.
they	give	us	some	sense	of	what	's	going	to	be	our	train	wreck	.
but	 non 	 e 	 	of	that	's	in	my	medical	record	.
and	it	's	not	in	 your 	 s 	 	either	.
so	,	here	's	my	friend	paul	.
he	's	a	 col 	 league 	 	.	he	 allow 	 ed 	 	his	cell	phone	to	be	 track 	 ed 	 	every	two	 hour 	 s 	 	,	24/7	,	365	 day 	 s 	 	out	of	the	year	for	the	last	two	 year 	 s 	 	,	 every 	 where 	 	he	went	.
and	you	can	see	he	's	 be 	 en 	 	to	a	few	 place 	 s 	 	around	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	he	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 pent 	 	most	of	his	time	.
if	you	 re 	 ally 	 	 stud 	 ied 	 	that	you	might	have	some	 clue 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	to	what	paul	 like 	 s 	 	to	do	.
 any 	 body 	 	got	any	 clue 	 s 	 	?	ski	.	right	.
we	can	zoom	in	here	,	and	we	 sudden 	 ly 	 	see	that	now	we	see	where	paul	 ha 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 pent 	 	a	 major 	 ity 	 	of	his	time	.
and	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	black	 dot 	 s 	 	are	all	of	the	toxic	 re 	 lease 	 	 inventor 	 ies 	 	that	are	 monitor 	 ed 	 	by	the	epa	.
did	you	know	that	data	 exist 	 ed 	 	?
for	every	community	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	you	could	have	your	own	 personal 	 ized 	 	map	of	that	.
so	,	our	cell	 phone 	 s 	 	can	now	build	a	place	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	how	paul	did	it	.	he	did	it	with	his	iphone	.
 th 	 is 	 	might	be	what	we	end	up	with	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	the	physician	would	have	in	front	of	him	and	her	when	we	enter	that	 ex 	 am 	 	room	 in 	 stead 	 	of	just	the	pink	slip	that	 s 	 aid 	 	i	paid	at	the	counter	.	right	?
 th 	 is 	 	could	be	my	little	 assess 	 ment 	 	.
and	he	 look 	 s 	 	at	that	and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 who 	 a 	 	bill	,	i	suggest	that	 may 	 be 	 	you	not	decide	,	just	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	out	here	in	 beaut 	 iful 	 	california	,	and	it	's	warm	every	day	,	that	you	get	out	and	run	at	six	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	at	night	.
i	'd	suggest	that	that	's	a	bad	idea	bill	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	report	.	``
what	i	'd	like	to	 leav 	 e 	 	you	for	are	two	 prescription 	 s 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	number	one	is	,	we	must	teach	 physician 	 s 	 	about	the	value	of	 geo 	 graphical 	 	information	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	 geo 	 medicine 	 	.	there	are	about	a	half	a	dozen	 program 	 s 	 	in	the	world	right	now	that	are	focused	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	they	're	in	the	early	 stage 	 s 	 	of	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
these	 program 	 s 	 	need	to	be	 support 	 ed 	 	,
and	we	need	to	teach	our	future	 doctor 	 s 	 	of	the	world	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	some	of	the	information	i	've	 share 	 d 	 	here	with	you	 to 	 day 	 	.
the	second	thing	we	need	to	do	is	while	we	're	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	 billion 	 s 	 	and	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	all	over	the	world	building	an	 electron 	 ic 	 	health	record	,	we	make	 s 	 ure 	 	we	put	a	place	 histo 	 ry 	 	 in 	 side 	 	that	medical	record	.
it	not	 on 	 ly 	 	will	be	 import 	 ant 	 	for	the	physician	;	it	will	be	 import 	 ant 	 	for	the	 research 	 ers 	 	that	now	will	have	huge	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	to	draw	 up 	 on 	 	.
but	it	will	 al 	 so 	 	be	 use 	 ful 	 	for	us	.
i	could	have	made	the	decision	,	if	i	had	 th 	 is 	 	information	,	not	to	move	to	the	 o 	 zone 	 	capital	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	could	n't	i	?	i	could	make	that	decision	.
or	i	could	 negoti 	 ate 	 	with	my	 employ 	 er 	 	to	make	that	decision	in	the	best	interest	of	 my 	 self 	 	and	my	company	.
with	that	,	i	would	like	to	just	say	that	jack	lord	 s 	 aid 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 al 	 most 	 	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
just	look	at	that	for	a	minute	.
that	was	what	the	 con 	 clusion 	 	of	the	dartmouth	atlas	of	 health 	 care 	 	was	about	,	was	 say 	 ing 	 	that	we	can	explain	the	 geo 	 graphic 	 	 vari 	 ations 	 	that	occur	in	disease	,	in	 ill 	 ness 	 	,	in	 well 	 ness 	 	,	and	how	our	 health 	 care 	 	system	 actual 	 ly 	 	 oper 	 ates 	 	.
that	was	what	he	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	on	that	quote	.
and	i	would	say	he	got	it	right	 al 	 most 	 	a	decade	ago	.
so	,	i	'd	 ver 	 y 	 	much	like	to	see	us	begin	to	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 e 	 ize 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	get	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 to 	 	our	medical	 record 	 s 	 	.
so	with	that	,	i	'll	 leav 	 e 	 	you	that	in	my	 part 	 icular 	 	view	of	view	of	health	:	 geo 	 graphy 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 matter 	 s 	 	.
and	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 geo 	 graphic 	 	information	can	make	both	you	and	me	 ver 	 y 	 	 health 	 y 	 	.	thank	you	.
