i	was	 bas 	 ically 	 	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	what	was	going	on	in	the	world	.
i	could	n't	understand	the	 starv 	 ation 	 	,	the	 destruct 	 ion 	 	,	the	 kill 	 ing 	 	of	 innoc 	 ent 	 	people	.
making	sense	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	thing	to	do	.
and	when	i	was	12	,	i	 be 	 came 	 	an	 a 	 ctor 	 	.
i	was	bottom	of	the	class	.	i	have	n't	got	any	 qual 	 ification 	 s 	 	.
i	was	told	i	was	 dy 	 s 	 lexic 	 	.
in	fact	,	i	have	got	 qual 	 ification 	 s 	 	.	i	got	a	d	in	 potter 	 y 	 	,	which	was	the	one	thing	that	i	did	get	--	which	was	 use 	 ful 	 	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	.
and	so	concern	is	where	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	 come 	 s 	 	from	.
and	then	,	 be 	 ing 	 	an	 a 	 ctor 	 	,	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	these	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	,
and	i	felt	the	content	of	the	work	that	i	was	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 re 	 ally 	 	was	n't	cutting	it	,	that	there	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	had	to	be	more	.
and	at	that	point	,	i	read	a	book	by	frank	barnaby	,	 th 	 is 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	nuclear	physicist	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	that	media	had	a	 respons 	 ibility 	 	,	that	all	 sector 	 s 	 	of	 socie 	 ty 	 	had	a	 respons 	 ibility 	 	to	try	and	progress	 thing 	 s 	 	and	move	 thing 	 s 	 	forward	.
and	that	 fascinate 	 d 	 	me	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 mess 	 ing 	 	around	with	a	camera	most	of	my	life	.
and	then	i	thought	,	well	 may 	 be 	 	i	could	do	 some 	 thing 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	i	could	 be 	 come 	 	a	 film 	 maker 	 	.	 may 	 be 	 	i	can	use	the	form	of	film	 construct 	 ively 	 	to	in	some	way	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	there	's	a	little	change	i	can	get	 involve 	 d 	 	in	.
so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	peace	,	and	i	was	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	to	you	,	 ver 	 y 	 	much	 move 	 d 	 	by	these	 image 	 s 	 	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	sense	of	that	.
could	i	go	and	speak	to	 old 	 er 	 	and	 wis 	 er 	 	people	who	would	tell	me	how	they	made	sense	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	going	on	?
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 frighten 	 ing 	 	.
but	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 mess 	 ing 	 	around	with	structure	 a 	 s 	 	an	 a 	 ctor 	 	,	that	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	sound	 bite 	 s 	 	in	 it 	 self 	 	was	n't	 en 	 ough 	 	,	that	there	 need 	 ed 	 	to	be	a	mountain	to	climb	,	there	 need 	 ed 	 	to	be	a	journey	that	i	had	to	take	.
and	if	i	took	that	journey	,	no	matter	 whet 	 her 	 	it	 fail 	 ed 	 	or	 succeed 	 ed 	 	,	it	would	be	 complete 	 ly 	 	 ir 	 relevant 	 	.	the	point	was	that	i	would	have	 some 	 thing 	 	to	hook	the	 question 	 s 	 	of	--	is	 human 	 kind 	 	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	 e 	 vil 	 	?
is	the	 destruct 	 ion 	 	of	the	world	 inevit 	 able 	 	?	should	i	have	children	?
is	that	a	 respons 	 ible 	 	thing	to	do	?	etc	.	,	etc	.
so	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	about	peace	,	and	then	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	,	well	where	's	the	 start 	 ing 	 	point	for	peace	?
and	that	was	when	i	had	the	idea	.
there	was	no	 start 	 ing 	 	point	for	peace	.
there	was	no	day	of	global	 un 	 ity 	 	.
there	was	no	day	of	 inter 	 cultural 	 	 co 	 operation 	 	.
there	was	no	day	when	 human 	 ity 	 	came	together	,	 separat 	 e 	 	in	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	and	just	 share 	 d 	 	it	together	--
that	we	're	in	 th 	 is 	 	together	,	and	that	if	we	 unit 	 ed 	 	and	we	 inter 	 cultural 	 ly 	 	 cooperate 	 d 	 	,	then	that	might	be	the	key	to	 human 	 ity 	 	's	 surviv 	 al 	 	.
that	might	shift	the	level	of	 conscious 	 ness 	 	around	the	fundamental	 issue 	 s 	 	that	 human 	 ity 	 	 face 	 s 	 	--	if	we	did	it	just	for	a	day	.
so	 obvious 	 ly 	 	we	did	n't	have	any	money	.
i	was	living	at	my	mom	's	place	.
and	we	 start 	 ed 	 	writing	 letter 	 s 	 	to	 every 	 body 	 	.
you	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	work	out	what	is	it	that	you	've	got	to	do	to	 fat 	 hom 	 	that	out	.	how	do	you	create	a	day	 vot 	 ed 	 	by	every	single	head	of	state	in	the	world	to	create	the	first	ever	 cease 	 fire 	 	 non 	 violence 	 	day	,	the	21st	of	september	?
and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	it	to	be	the	21st	of	september	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	my	 grand 	 dad 	 	's	 favor 	 ite 	 	number	.
he	was	a	prisoner	of	war	.
he	saw	the	bomb	go	off	at	nagasaki	.
it	 poison 	 ed 	 	his	blood	.	he	 di 	 ed 	 	when	i	was	11	.
so	he	was	like	my	hero	.
and	the	reason	why	21	was	the	number	is	700	men	left	,	23	came	back	,	two	 di 	 ed 	 	on	the	boat	and	21	hit	the	ground	.
and	that	's	why	we	 want 	 ed 	 	it	to	be	the	21st	of	september	 a 	 s 	 	the	date	of	peace	.
so	we	 beg 	 an 	 	 th 	 is 	 	journey	,	and	we	 launch 	 ed 	 	it	in	1999	.
and	we	wrote	to	 head 	 s 	 	of	state	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 ambassador 	 s 	 	,	 no 	 bel 	 	peace	 laureate 	 s 	 	,	ngos	,	 faith 	 s 	 	,	 vari 	 ous 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	--	 liter 	 ally 	 	wrote	to	 every 	 body 	 	.
and	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	some	 letter 	 s 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	coming	back	.	and	we	 start 	 ed 	 	to	build	 th 	 is 	 	case	.
and	i	remember	the	first	letter	.
one	of	the	first	 letter 	 s 	 	was	from	the	dalai	lama	.
and	of	course	we	did	n't	have	the	money	;	we	 we 	 re 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	 guitar 	 s 	 	and	 get 	 ting 	 	the	money	for	the	 stamp 	 s 	 	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	out	all	of	[	 th 	 is 	 	mail	]	.
a	letter	came	through	from	the	dalai	lama	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	thing	.	come	and	see	me	.
i	'd	love	to	talk	to	you	about	the	first	ever	day	of	peace	.	``	and	we	did	n't	have	money	for	the	flight	.
and	i	rang	 s 	 ir 	 	bob	ayling	,	who	was	ceo	of	ba	at	the	time	,	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	mate	,	we	've	got	 th 	 is 	 	 invit 	 ation 	 	.
could	you	give	me	a	flight	?	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	going	to	go	see	him	.	``	and	of	course	,	we	went	and	saw	him	and	it	was	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
and	then	dr.	oscar	 aria 	 s 	 	came	forward	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	let	me	go	back	to	that	slide	,	 be 	 cause 	 	when	we	 launch 	 ed 	 	it	in	1999	--	 th 	 is 	 	idea	to	create	the	first	ever	day	of	 cease 	 fire 	 	and	non	-	violence	--	we	 invit 	 ed 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	.
well	not	 thousand 	 s 	 	--	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	people	,	 lot 	 s 	 	of	people	--	all	the	press	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	try	and	create	the	first	ever	world	peace	day	,	a	peace	day	.
and	we	 invit 	 ed 	 	 every 	 body 	 	,	and	no	press	 show 	 ed 	 	up	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	114	people	there	--	they	 we 	 re 	 	 most 	 ly 	 	my	 friend 	 s 	 	and	family	.
and	that	was	kind	of	like	the	launch	of	 th 	 is 	 	thing	.
but	it	did	n't	matter	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	 document 	 ing 	 	,	and	that	was	the	thing	.
for	me	,	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	about	the	process	.
it	was	n't	about	the	end	result	.
and	that	's	the	 beaut 	 iful 	 	thing	about	the	camera	.
they	used	to	say	the	pen	is	 might 	 ier 	 	than	the	 s 	 word 	 	.	i	think	the	camera	is	.
and	just	 stay 	 ing 	 	in	the	moment	with	it	was	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	thing	and	 re 	 ally 	 	 empower 	 ing 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
so	 any 	 way 	 	,	we	 beg 	 an 	 	the	journey	.
and	here	you	see	people	like	mary	robinson	,	i	went	to	see	in	geneva	.
i	'm	cutting	my	hair	,	it	's	 get 	 ting 	 	short	and	long	,	 be 	 cause 	 	every	time	i	saw	kofi	annan	,	i	was	so	 worri 	 ed 	 	that	he	thought	i	was	a	 hip 	 pie 	 	that	i	cut	it	,
and	that	was	kind	of	what	was	going	on	.
 yea 	 h 	 	,	i	'm	not	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	it	now	.
so	mary	robinson	,	she	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	``	listen	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	idea	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	time	 ha 	 s 	 	come	.	 th 	 is 	 	must	be	 create 	 d 	 	.	``	kofi	annan	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	will	be	 benefici 	 al 	 	to	my	 troop 	 s 	 	on	the	ground	.	``	the	oau	at	the	time	,	led	by	salim	ahmed	salim	,	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	must	get	the	african	 count 	 ries 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	.	``	dr.	oscar	 aria 	 s 	 	,	 no 	 bel 	 	peace	laureate	,	 p 	 resident 	 	now	of	costa	rica	,	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'll	do	 every 	 thing 	 	that	i	can	.	``	so	i	went	and	saw	amr	moussa	at	the	league	of	arab	 state 	 s 	 	.
i	met	mandela	at	the	arusha	peace	 talk 	 s 	 	,
and	so	on	and	so	on	and	so	on	--	while	i	was	building	the	case	to	prove	 whet 	 her 	 	 th 	 is 	 	idea	would	make	sense	.
and	then	we	 we 	 re 	 	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	the	people	.	we	 we 	 re 	 	 document 	 ing 	 	 every 	 where 	 	.
76	 count 	 ries 	 	in	the	last	12	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	've	 visit 	 ed 	 	.
and	i	've	 al 	 ways 	 	spoken	to	women	and	children	 where 	 ver 	 	i	've	gone	.
i	've	 record 	 ed 	 	44,000	young	people	.
i	've	 record 	 ed 	 	about	900	 hour 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 thought 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	clear	about	how	young	people	feel	when	you	talk	to	them	about	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	 start 	 ing 	 	point	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 action 	 s 	 	for	a	more	 peace 	 ful 	 	world	through	 the 	 ir 	 	 poet 	 ry 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	art	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 liter 	 ature 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	music	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 s 	 port 	 	,	 what 	 ever 	 	it	might	be	.
and	we	 we 	 re 	 	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	 every 	 body 	 	.
and	it	was	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	thing	,	 work 	 ing 	 	with	the	u.n.	and	 work 	 ing 	 	with	ngos	and	building	 th 	 is 	 	case	.
i	felt	that	i	was	 present 	 ing 	 	a	case	on	 be 	 half 	 	of	the	global	community	to	try	and	create	 th 	 is 	 	day	.
and	the	 strong 	 er 	 	the	case	and	the	more	 detail 	 ed 	 	it	was	,	the	better	chance	we	had	of	creating	 th 	 is 	 	day	.
and	it	was	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	,	 th 	 is 	 	,	where	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	was	in	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	kind	of	 think 	 ing 	 	no	matter	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	it	did	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	matter	.
it	did	n't	matter	if	it	did	n't	create	a	day	of	peace	.
the	fact	is	that	,	if	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	and	it	did	n't	work	,	then	i	could	make	a	 state 	 ment 	 	about	how	 un 	 will 	 ing 	 	the	global	community	is	to	 un 	 ite 	 	--
 un 	 til 	 	,	it	was	in	somalia	,	 pick 	 ing 	 	up	that	young	girl	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	young	child	who	'd	taken	about	an	inch	and	a	half	out	of	her	leg	with	no	 anti 	 septic 	 	,	and	that	young	boy	who	was	a	child	soldier	,	who	told	me	he	'd	 kill 	 ed 	 	people	--	he	was	about	12	--
these	 thing 	 s 	 	made	me	 real 	 ize 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	not	a	film	that	i	could	just	stop	.
and	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	at	that	moment	 some 	 thing 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	me	,	which	 obvious 	 ly 	 	made	me	go	,	``	i	'm	going	to	document	.
if	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	film	that	i	ever	make	,	i	'm	going	to	document	 un 	 til 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	 re 	 ality 	 	.	``	 be 	 cause 	 	we	've	got	to	stop	,	we	've	got	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	where	we	 un 	 ite 	 	--	 separat 	 e 	 	from	all	the	 politic 	 s 	 	and	 relig 	 ion 	 	that	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	young	person	,	is	 con 	 fusing 	 	me	.
i	do	n't	know	how	to	get	 involve 	 d 	 	in	that	process	.
and	then	on	the	 seven 	 th 	 	of	september	,	i	was	 invit 	 ed 	 	to	new	york	.
the	costa	rican	government	and	the	british	government	had	put	forward	to	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	general	 assem 	 bly 	 	,	with	54	co	-	 sponsor 	 s 	 	,	the	idea	of	the	first	ever	 cease 	 fire 	 	 non 	 violence 	 	day	,	the	21st	of	september	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 fix 	 ed 	 	calendar	date	,	and	it	was	 un 	 anim 	 ously 	 	 adopt 	 ed 	 	by	every	head	of	state	in	the	world	.
 yea 	 h 	 	,	but	there	 we 	 re 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 individual 	 s 	 	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	who	made	that	a	 re 	 ality 	 	.
and	thank	you	to	all	of	them	.
that	was	an	 in 	 credible 	 	moment	.
i	was	at	the	top	of	the	general	 assem 	 bly 	 	just	looking	down	 in 	 to 	 	it	and	 see 	 ing 	 	it	happen	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	,	when	it	 start 	 ed 	 	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	at	the	 glob 	 e 	 	,	and	there	was	no	press	.
and	now	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	well	,	the	press	it	 re 	 ally 	 	going	to	hear	 th 	 is 	 	story	.	``	and	 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	we	 start 	 ed 	 	to	 institution 	 al 	 ize 	 	 th 	 is 	 	day	.
kofi	annan	 invit 	 ed 	 	me	on	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	of	september	the	11th	to	do	a	press	 con 	 ference 	 	.
and	it	was	8:00	am	when	i	stood	there	.
and	i	was	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	him	to	come	down	,	and	i	 k 	 new 	 	that	he	was	on	his	way	.
and	 obvious 	 ly 	 	he	never	came	down	.	the	 state 	 ment 	 	was	never	made	.
the	world	was	never	told	there	was	a	day	of	global	 cease 	 fire 	 	and	 non 	 violence 	 	.
and	it	was	 obvious 	 ly 	 	a	tragic	moment	for	the	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	who	lost	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	,	there	and	then	 sub 	 sequent 	 ly 	 	all	over	the	world	.
it	never	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
and	i	remember	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	why	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	we	have	to	work	even	 hard 	 er 	 	.
and	we	have	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	day	work	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 create 	 d 	 	;	 no 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	.
but	we	have	to	 continu 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	journey	,	and	we	have	to	tell	people	,	and	we	have	to	prove	it	can	work	.	``	and	i	left	new	york	 freak 	 ed 	 	,	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	 empower 	 ed 	 	.
and	i	felt	inspired	by	the	 possibil 	 ities 	 	that	if	it	did	,	then	 may 	 be 	 	we	would	n't	see	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	.
i	remember	 put 	 ting 	 	that	film	out	and	going	to	 cynic 	 s 	 	.
i	was	 show 	 ing 	 	the	film	,	and	i	remember	 be 	 ing 	 	in	israel	and	 get 	 ting 	 	it	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 s 	 laughter 	 ed 	 	by	some	 guy 	 s 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	 watch 	 ed 	 	the	film	--	that	it	's	just	a	day	of	peace	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	 any 	 thing 	 	.
it	's	not	going	to	work	;	you	're	not	going	to	stop	the	 fight 	 ing 	 	in	afghanistan	;	the	taliban	wo	n't	listen	,	etc	.	,	etc	.	it	's	just	 symbol 	 ism 	 	.
and	that	was	even	 wo 	 rse 	 	than	 actual 	 ly 	 	what	had	just	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	could	n't	not	work	.
i	'd	spoken	in	somalia	,	burundi	,	gaza	,	the	west	bank	,	india	,	sri	lanka	,	congo	,	 where 	 ver 	 	it	was	,	and	they	'd	all	tell	me	,	``	if	you	can	create	a	window	of	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	,	we	can	move	aid	,	we	can	 vaccin 	 ate 	 	children	.
children	can	lead	 the 	 ir 	 	 project 	 s 	 	.
they	can	 un 	 ite 	 	.	they	can	come	together	.	if	people	would	stop	,	 live 	 s 	 	will	be	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	.	``	that	's	what	i	'd	heard	.
and	i	'd	heard	that	from	the	people	who	 re 	 ally 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	what	conflict	was	about	.
and	so	i	went	back	to	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	.
i	 decide 	 d 	 	that	i	'd	 continu 	 e 	 	 film 	 ing 	 	and	make	 an 	 other 	 	movie	.
and	i	went	back	to	the	u.n.	for	 an 	 other 	 	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
we	 start 	 ed 	 	moving	around	the	 corridor 	 s 	 	of	the	u.n.	system	,	 government 	 s 	 	and	ngos	,	 try 	 ing 	 	 desperate 	 ly 	 	to	find	 some 	 body 	 	to	come	forward	and	have	a	go	at	it	,	see	if	we	could	make	it	possible	.
and	after	 lot 	 s 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	i	'm	 de 	 light 	 ed 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	man	,	ahmad	fawzi	,	one	of	my	heroes	and	 mentor 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	,	he	 manage 	 d 	 	to	get	unicef	 involve 	 d 	 	.

it	was	 historic 	 al 	 	.	could	it	work	in	afghanistan	with	unama	and	who	and	civil	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	etc	.	,	etc	.	,	etc	.	?

and	i	saw	him	 be 	 cause 	 	he	was	an	 a 	 ctor 	 	,	i	was	an	 a 	 ctor 	 	,
i	had	a	 connect 	 ion 	 	to	him	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 need 	 ed 	 	to	get	to	the	press	,	we	 need 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 attract 	 ion 	 	,	we	 need 	 ed 	 	the	media	to	be	 involve 	 d 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	if	we	start	 pump 	 ing 	 	it	up	a	bit	 may 	 be 	 	more	people	would	listen	and	there	'd	be	more	--	when	we	got	 in 	 to 	 	certain	 area 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	there	would	be	more	people	 interest 	 ed 	 	.

i	wo	n't	go	 in 	 to 	 	that	.
so	jude	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	i	'll	do	some	 state 	 ments 	 	for	you	.	``	while	i	was	 film 	 ing 	 	these	 state 	 ments 	 	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	``	where	are	you	going	next	?	``	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'm	going	to	go	to	afghanistan	.	``	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 re 	 ally 	 	?	``	and	i	could	sort	of	see	a	little	look	in	his	eye	of	interest	.

it	'd	be	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	if	you	came	.
it	would	help	and	 br 	 ing 	 	attention	.
and	that	attention	would	help	leverage	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	all	of	the	other	 side 	 s 	 	of	it	.	``	i	think	there	's	a	number	of	 pillar 	 s 	 	to	success	.

the	other	is	you	've	got	to	have	a	 constit 	 uency 	 	,	you	've	got	to	have	finance	,	and	you	've	got	to	be	able	to	raise	 aware 	 ness 	 	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	i	could	never	raise	 aware 	 ness 	 	by	 my 	 self 	 	,	no	matter	what	i	'd	 achiev 	 ed 	 	.
so	these	 guy 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 cruci 	 al 	 	.
so	he	 s 	 aid 	 	 y 	 es 	 	,	and	we	found	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	afghanistan	.
it	was	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	thing	that	when	we	 land 	 ed 	 	there	,	i	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	 vari 	 ous 	 	people	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	to	me	,	``	you	've	got	to	get	 every 	 body 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	here	.
you	ca	n't	just	expect	it	to	work	.	you	have	to	get	out	and	work	.	``	and	we	did	,	and	we	 travel 	 ed 	 	around	,	and	we	spoke	to	 elder 	 s 	 	,	we	spoke	to	 doctor 	 s 	 	,	we	spoke	to	 nurse 	 s 	 	,	we	held	press	 con 	 ference 	 s 	 	,	we	went	out	with	 soldier 	 s 	 	,	we	 s 	 at 	 	down	with	isaf	,	we	 s 	 at 	 	down	with	nato	,	we	 s 	 at 	 	down	with	the	u.k.	government	.
i	mean	,	we	 bas 	 ically 	 	 s 	 at 	 	down	with	 every 	 body 	 	--	in	and	out	of	 school 	 s 	 	with	 mini 	 sters 	 	of	education	,	 hold 	 ing 	 	these	press	 con 	 ference 	 s 	 	,	which	of	course	,	now	 we 	 re 	 	 load 	 ed 	 	with	press	,	 every 	 body 	 	was	there	.
there	was	an	interest	in	what	was	going	on	.
 th 	 is 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	woman	,	fatima	gailani	,	was	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 instrument 	 al 	 	in	what	went	on	 a 	 s 	 	she	was	the	 spoke 	 s 	 person 	 	for	the	 resist 	 ance 	 	against	the	russians	.

and	she	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 cruci 	 al 	 	in	 get 	 ting 	 	the	 mess 	 age 	 	in	.
and	then	we	went	home	.	we	'd	sort	of	 d 	 one 	 	it	.
we	had	to	wait	now	and	see	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
and	i	got	home	,	and	i	remember	one	of	the	team	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	in	a	letter	to	me	from	the	taliban	.
and	that	letter	 bas 	 ically 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	'll	 observ 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	day	.
we	will	 observ 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	day	.
we	see	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	window	of	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.

and	then	 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	i	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 k 	 new 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	there	was	a	chance	.
and	 day 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	1.6	million	children	 we 	 re 	 	 vaccin 	 ated 	 	against	 poli 	 o 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 con 	 sequence 	 	of	 every 	 body 	 	 stop 	 ping 	 	.
and	like	the	general	 assem 	 bly 	 	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	the	most	 wonder 	 ful 	 	,	 wonder 	 ful 	 	moment	.
and	so	then	we	 wrap 	 ped 	 	the	film	up	and	we	put	it	together	 be 	 cause 	 	we	had	to	go	back	.
we	put	it	 in 	 to 	 	dari	and	pashto	.	we	put	it	in	the	local	 dialect 	 s 	 	.
we	went	back	to	afghanistan	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	next	year	was	coming	,	and	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	support	.
but	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	go	back	,	 be 	 cause 	 	these	people	in	afghanistan	 we 	 re 	 	the	heroes	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	the	people	who	 believ 	 ed 	 	in	peace	and	the	 possibil 	 ities 	 	of	it	,	etc	.	,	etc	.	--	and	they	made	it	real	.
and	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	go	back	and	show	them	the	film	and	say	,	``	look	,	you	 guy 	 s 	 	made	 th 	 is 	 	possible	.	and	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.	``	and	we	 g 	 ave 	 	the	film	over	.
 obvious 	 ly 	 	it	was	 show 	 n 	 	,	and	it	was	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
and	then	that	year	,	that	year	,	2008	,	 th 	 is 	 	isaf	 state 	 ment 	 	from	kabul	,	afghanistan	,	september	17th	:	``	general	stanley	mcchrystal	,	 command 	 er 	 	of	 inter 	 national 	 	security	 assist 	 ance 	 	 force 	 s 	 	in	afghanistan	,	 announce 	 d 	 	 to 	 day 	 	isaf	will	not	conduct	offensive	 militar 	 y 	 	 operation 	 s 	 	on	the	21st	of	september	.	``	they	 we 	 re 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	they	would	stop	.
and	then	there	was	 th 	 is 	 	other	 state 	 ment 	 	that	came	out	from	the	u.n.	 depart 	 ment 	 	of	security	and	 safe 	 ty 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	that	,	in	afghanistan	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	work	,	the	violence	was	down	by	70	percent	.
70	percent	 r 	 eduction 	 	in	violence	on	 th 	 is 	 	day	at	 l 	 east 	 	.
and	that	 complete 	 ly 	 	 ble 	 w 	 	my	mind	 al 	 most 	 	more	than	 any 	 thing 	 	.
and	i	remember	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 tuck 	 	in	new	york	,	 th 	 is 	 	time	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 volcan 	 o 	 	,	which	was	 obvious 	 ly 	 	much	less	 harm 	 ful 	 	.
and	i	was	there	 think 	 ing 	 	about	what	was	going	on	.
and	i	 ke 	 pt 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	70	percent	.
70	percent	 r 	 eduction 	 	in	violence	--	in	what	 every 	 one 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	was	 complete 	 ly 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	and	you	could	n't	do	.
and	that	made	me	think	that	,	if	we	can	get	70	percent	in	afghanistan	,	then	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	we	can	get	70	percent	 r 	 eduction 	 	 every 	 where 	 	.
we	have	to	go	for	a	global	truce	.
we	have	to	 util 	 ize 	 	 th 	 is 	 	day	of	 cease 	 fire 	 	and	 non 	 violence 	 	and	go	for	a	global	truce	,	go	for	the	largest	 record 	 ed 	 	 cess 	 ation 	 	of	 hostil 	 ities 	 	,	both	 domestic 	 ally 	 	and	 inter 	 national 	 ly 	 	,	ever	 record 	 ed 	 	.
that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	we	must	do	.
and	on	the	21st	of	september	 th 	 is 	 	year	,	we	're	going	to	launch	that	campaign	at	the	o	2	arena	to	go	for	that	process	,	to	try	and	create	the	largest	 record 	 ed 	 	 cess 	 ation 	 	of	 hostil 	 ities 	 	.
and	we	will	 util 	 ize 	 	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	--	have	a	dance	and	social	media	and	 visit 	 ing 	 	on	facebook	and	visit	the	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	sign	the	petition	.
and	it	's	in	the	six	official	 language 	 s 	 	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	.
and	we	'll	 global 	 ly 	 	link	with	government	,	inter	-	government	,	non	-	government	,	education	,	 un 	 ions 	 	,	 s 	 port 	 s 	 	.
and	you	can	see	the	education	box	there	.
we	've	got	 resource 	 s 	 	at	the	moment	in	174	 count 	 ries 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	young	people	to	be	the	 driv 	 ing 	 	force	 be 	 hind 	 	the	vision	of	that	global	truce	.
and	 obvious 	 ly 	 	the	life	-	saving	is	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	,	the	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	help	.
 link 	 ing 	 	up	with	the	olympics	--	i	went	and	saw	seb	coe	.	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	london	2012	is	about	truce	.
 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	that	's	what	it	's	about	.	``	why	do	n't	we	all	team	up	?	why	do	n't	we	 br 	 ing 	 	truce	to	life	?
why	do	n't	you	support	the	process	of	the	largest	ever	global	truce	?
we	'll	make	a	new	film	about	 th 	 is 	 	process	.
we	'll	 util 	 ize 	 	 s 	 port 	 	and	 foot 	 ball 	 	.
on	the	day	of	peace	,	there	's	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 foot 	 ball 	 	 match 	 es 	 	all	 play 	 ed 	 	,	from	the	 favela 	 s 	 	of	brazil	to	 where 	 ver 	 	it	might	be	.
so	,	 util 	 izing 	 	all	of	these	ways	to	inspire	individual	action	.
and	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	we	have	to	try	that	.
we	have	to	work	together	.
and	when	i	stand	here	in	front	of	all	of	you	,	and	the	people	who	will	watch	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	i	'm	 excit 	 ed 	 	,	on	 be 	 half 	 	of	 every 	 body 	 	i	've	met	,	that	there	is	a	 possibil 	 ity 	 	that	our	world	could	 un 	 ite 	 	,	that	we	could	come	together	 a 	 s 	 	one	,	that	we	could	lift	the	level	of	 conscious 	 ness 	 	around	the	fundamental	 issue 	 s 	 	,	 br 	 ought 	 	about	by	 individual 	 s 	 	.
i	was	with	brahimi	,	ambassador	brahimi	.
i	think	he	's	one	of	the	most	 in 	 credible 	 	men	in	relation	to	 inter 	 national 	 	 politic 	 s 	 	--	in	afghanistan	,	in	 ir 	 aq 	 	.
he	's	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	man	.
and	i	 s 	 at 	 	with	him	a	few	 week 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	to	him	,	``	mr.	brahimi	,	is	 th 	 is 	 	nuts	,	going	for	a	global	truce	?

it	's	about	your	 constit 	 u 	 encies 	 	;	it	's	about	your	 business 	 es 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	together	,	by	 work 	 ing 	 	together	,	i	 serious 	 ly 	 	think	we	can	start	to	change	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	there	's	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	man	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	audience	,	and	i	do	n't	know	where	he	is	,	who	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	a	few	 day 	 s 	 	ago	--	 be 	 cause 	 	i	did	a	little	 rehears 	 al 	 	--	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	day	and	 imagin 	 ing 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	square	with	365	 square 	 s 	 	,	and	one	of	them	is	white	.	``	and	it	then	made	me	think	about	a	glass	of	water	,	which	is	clear	.
if	you	put	one	drop	,	one	drop	of	 some 	 thing 	 	,	in	that	water	,	it	'll	change	it	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
by	 work 	 ing 	 	together	,	we	can	create	peace	one	day	.
