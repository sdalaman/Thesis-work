if	you	go	on	the	ted	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	you	can	 current 	 ly 	 	find	there	over	a	full	week	of	tedtalk	 video 	 s 	 	,	over	1.3	million	 word 	 s 	 	of	 tran 	 script 	 s 	 	and	 million 	 s 	 	of	user	 rating 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	a	huge	amount	of	data	.
and	it	got	me	 wonder 	 ing 	 	:	if	you	took	all	 th 	 is 	 	data	and	put	it	through	 statistic 	 al 	 	analysis	,	could	you	reverse	engineer	a	tedtalk	?
could	you	create	the	ultimate	tedtalk	?
and	 al 	 so 	 	,	could	you	create	the	worst	possible	tedtalk	that	they	would	still	let	you	get	away	with	?
to	find	 th 	 is 	 	out	,	i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	three	 thing 	 s 	 	:
i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	 top 	 ic 	 	that	you	should	 choos 	 e 	 	,
i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	how	you	should	deliver	it	and	the	 visual 	 s 	 	 on 	 stage 	 	.
now	,	with	the	 top 	 ic 	 	:	there	's	a	whole	range	of	 top 	 ic 	 s 	 	you	can	 choos 	 e 	 	,	but	you	should	 choos 	 e 	 	 wise 	 ly 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	your	 top 	 ic 	 	 strong 	 ly 	 	 correlate 	 s 	 	with	how	 user 	 s 	 	will	react	to	your	talk	.
now	,	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	more	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	,	let	's	look	at	the	list	of	top	10	 word 	 s 	 	that	 statistic 	 ally 	 	stick	out	in	the	most	 favor 	 ite 	 	tedtalks	and	in	the	 l 	 east 	 	 favor 	 ite 	 	tedtalks	.
so	if	you	came	here	to	talk	about	how	french	coffee	will	spread	happiness	in	our	 brain 	 s 	 	,	that	's	a	go	.
 where 	 a 	 s 	 	,	if	you	 want 	 ed 	 	to	talk	about	your	project	 in 	 vol 	 v 	 ing 	 	oxygen	,	 girl 	 s 	 	,	 air 	 craft 	 	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	would	like	to	hear	that	talk	,	but	 statistic 	 s 	 	say	it	's	not	so	good	.
oh	,	well	.
if	you	 general 	 ize 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	the	most	 favor 	 ite 	 	tedtalks	are	 t 	 hose 	 	that	feature	 top 	 ic 	 s 	 	we	can	connect	with	,	both	 eas 	 ily 	 	and	 deep 	 ly 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	happiness	,	our	own	body	,	food	,	 emotion 	 s 	 	.
and	the	more	technical	 top 	 ic 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 architect 	 ure 	 	,	 material 	 s 	 	and	,	 strange 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	men	,	 t 	 hose 	 	are	not	good	 top 	 ic 	 s 	 	to	talk	about	.
how	should	you	deliver	your	talk	?
ted	is	famous	for	 keep 	 ing 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	sharp	eye	on	the	clock	,	so	they	're	going	to	hate	me	for	 reveal 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	you	should	talk	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	they	will	let	you	.	 be 	 cause 	 	the	most	 favor 	 ite 	 	tedtalks	are	,	on	average	,	over	50	percent	 long 	 er 	 	than	the	 l 	 east 	 	 favor 	 ite 	 	 one 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 hold 	 s 	 	true	for	all	 rank 	 ing 	 	 list 	 s 	 	on	ted.com	 ex 	 cept 	 	if	you	want	to	have	a	talk	that	's	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	inspiring	or	funny	.
then	,	you	should	be	brief	.	but	other	than	that	,	talk	 un 	 til 	 	they	drag	you	off	the	stage	.
now	,	while	...	while	you	're	 push 	 ing 	 	the	clock	,	there	's	a	few	 rule 	 s 	 	to	obey	.
i	found	these	 rule 	 s 	 	out	by	 compar 	 ing 	 	the	 statistic 	 s 	 	of	four	-	word	 phrase 	 s 	 	that	appear	more	often	in	the	most	 favor 	 ite 	 	tedtalks	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	the	 l 	 east 	 	 favor 	 ite 	 	tedtalks	.
i	'll	give	you	three	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
first	of	all	,	i	must	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	speaker	,	provide	a	service	to	the	audience	and	talk	about	what	i	will	give	you	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 say 	 ing 	 	what	i	ca	n't	have	.
 second 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	 imper 	 ative 	 	that	you	do	not	cite	the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	for	the	speaker	--	that	's	the	good	news	--	to	fake	intellectual	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	.
if	i	do	n't	understand	 some 	 thing 	 	,	i	can	just	say	,	``	etc	.	,	 etc 	 . 	 	``
you	'll	all	stay	with	me	.
it	's	 perfect 	 ly 	 	fine	.
now	,	let	's	go	to	the	 visual 	 s 	 	.
the	most	obvious	visual	thing	on	stage	is	the	speaker	.
and	analysis	 show 	 s 	 	if	you	want	to	be	among	the	most	 favor 	 ite 	 	ted	 speaker 	 s 	 	,	you	should	let	your	hair	grow	a	little	bit	 long 	 er 	 	than	average	,	make	 s 	 ure 	 	you	wear	your	 glass 	 es 	 	and	be	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	more	 dress 	 ed 	 	-	up	than	the	average	ted	speaker	.
 slide 	 s 	 	are	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	you	might	consider	going	for	 prop 	 s 	 	.
and	now	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	,	that	is	the	mood	 on 	 stage 	 	.
color	 play 	 s 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	role	.
color	 close 	 ly 	 	 correlate 	 s 	 	with	the	 rating 	 s 	 	that	 talk 	 s 	 	get	on	the	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 fasci 	 nating 	 	 talk 	 s 	 	contain	a	 statistic 	 ally 	 	high	amount	of	 exact 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	blue	color	,	much	more	than	the	average	tedtalk	.
 ing 	 en 	 ious 	 	tedtalks	,	much	more	 th 	 is 	 	green	color	,	etc	.	,	et	.
now	,	 personal 	 ly 	 	,	i	think	i	'm	not	the	first	one	who	 ha 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	analysis	,	but	i	'll	 leav 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	to	your	good	judgment	.
so	,	now	it	's	time	to	put	it	all	together	and	design	the	ultimate	tedtalk	.
now	,	since	 th 	 is 	 	is	tedactive	,	and	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	my	analysis	that	i	should	 actual 	 ly 	 	give	you	 some 	 thing 	 	,	i	will	not	impose	the	ultimate	or	worst	tedtalk	on	you	,	but	 ra 	 ther 	 	give	you	a	tool	to	create	your	own	.
and	i	call	 th 	 is 	 	tool	the	tedpad	.
and	the	tedpad	is	a	 m 	 atrix 	 	of	100	 specific 	 ally 	 	 select 	 ed 	 	,	 high 	 ly 	 	 cur 	 ated 	 	 sentence 	 s 	 	that	you	can	 eas 	 ily 	 	piece	together	to	get	your	own	tedtalk	.
you	 on 	 ly 	 	have	to	make	one	decision	,	and	that	is	:	are	you	going	to	use	the	white	version	for	 ver 	 y 	 	good	tedtalks	,	about	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	,	human	 gen 	 ius 	 	?
or	are	you	going	to	go	with	a	black	version	,	which	will	allow	you	to	create	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	tedtalks	,	 most 	 ly 	 	about	 blog 	 s 	 	,	 politic 	 s 	 	and	stuff	?
so	,	download	it	and	have	 f 	 un 	 	with	it	.
now	i	hope	you	enjoy	the	session	.
i	hope	you	enjoy	 design 	 ing 	 	your	own	ultimate	and	worst	possible	tedtalks	.
and	i	hope	some	of	you	will	be	inspired	for	next	year	to	create	 th 	 is 	 	,	which	i	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	see	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
