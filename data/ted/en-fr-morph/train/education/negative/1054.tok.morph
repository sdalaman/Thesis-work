i	just	did	 some 	 thing 	 	i	've	never	 d 	 one 	 	before	.
i	 s 	 pent 	 	a	week	at	sea	on	a	research	vessel	.
now	i	'm	not	a	scientist	,	but	i	was	 ac 	 company 	 ing 	 	a	 remark 	 able 	 	scientific	team	from	the	university	of	south	florida	who	have	 be 	 en 	 	 track 	 ing 	 	the	 travel 	 s 	 	of	bp	's	oil	in	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	of	mexico	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	boat	we	 we 	 re 	 	on	,	by	the	way	.
the	 scientist 	 s 	 	i	was	with	 we 	 re 	 	not	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	the	effect	of	the	oil	and	 dispers 	 ants 	 	on	the	big	stuff	--	the	 bird 	 s 	 	,	the	 turtle 	 s 	 	,	the	 dolphin 	 s 	 	,	the	 glamor 	 ous 	 	stuff	.
they	're	looking	at	the	 re 	 ally 	 	little	stuff	that	 get 	 s 	 	eaten	by	the	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	less	little	stuff	that	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 get 	 s 	 	eaten	by	the	big	stuff	.
and	what	they	're	 find 	 ing 	 	is	that	even	trace	 amount 	 s 	 	of	oil	and	 dispers 	 ants 	 	can	be	 high 	 ly 	 	toxic	to	 phy 	 to 	 plankton 	 	,	which	is	 ver 	 y 	 	bad	news	,	 be 	 cause 	 	so	much	life	 depend 	 s 	 	on	it	.
so	 contr 	 ary 	 	to	what	we	heard	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	back	about	how	75	percent	of	that	oil	sort	of	 magic 	 ally 	 	 disappear 	 ed 	 	and	we	did	n't	have	to	worry	about	it	,	 th 	 is 	 	disaster	is	still	 un 	 fold 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	still	 work 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	way	up	the	food	chain	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	should	n't	come	 a 	 s 	 	a	surprise	to	us	.
rachel	carson	--	the	 god 	 mother 	 	of	modern	 environment 	 al 	 ism 	 	--	 war 	 ned 	 	us	about	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	thing	back	in	1962	.
she	 point 	 ed 	 	out	that	the	``	control	men	``	--	 a 	 s 	 	she	 call 	 ed 	 	them	--	who	carpet	-	 bomb 	 ed 	 	 town 	 s 	 	and	 field 	 s 	 	with	toxic	 insect 	 icide 	 s 	 	like	ddt	,	 we 	 re 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	kill	the	little	stuff	,	the	 insect 	 s 	 	,	not	the	 bird 	 s 	 	.
but	they	 for 	 got 	 	 th 	 is 	 	:	the	fact	that	 bird 	 s 	 	dine	on	 grub 	 s 	 	,	that	 rob 	 in 	 s 	 	eat	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 worm 	 s 	 	now	 saturate 	 d 	 	with	ddt	.
and	so	,	 rob 	 in 	 	 egg 	 s 	 	 fail 	 ed 	 	to	hatch	,	 song 	 bird 	 s 	 	 di 	 ed 	 	en	masse	,	 town 	 s 	 	fell	silent	.
thus	the	title	``	silent	spring	.	``
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 pin 	 point 	 	what	 keep 	 s 	 	 draw 	 ing 	 	me	back	to	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	of	mexico	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	canadian	,	and	i	can	draw	no	 ance 	 stral 	 	ties	.
and	i	think	what	it	is	is	i	do	n't	think	we	have	fully	come	to	 term 	 s 	 	with	the	meaning	of	 th 	 is 	 	disaster	,	with	what	it	 me 	 ant 	 	to	witness	a	hole	 rip 	 ped 	 	in	our	world	,	with	what	it	 me 	 ant 	 	to	watch	the	 content 	 s 	 	of	the	earth	gush	forth	on	live	tv	,	24	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	,	for	 month 	 s 	 	.
after	 tell 	 ing 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	for	so	long	that	our	 tool 	 s 	 	and	technology	can	control	nature	,	 sudden 	 ly 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	face	-	to	-	face	with	our	 weak 	 ness 	 	,	with	our	lack	of	control	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	oil	burst	out	of	every	attempt	to	contain	it	--	``	top	 hat 	 s 	 	,	``	``	top	 kill 	 s 	 	``	and	,	most	 memor 	 ably 	 	,	the	``	junk	shot	``	--	the	bright	idea	of	 fir 	 ing 	 	old	 tire 	 s 	 	and	golf	 ball 	 s 	 	down	that	hole	in	the	world	.
but	even	more	 s 	 tri 	 king 	 	than	the	ferocious	power	 e 	 man 	 ating 	 	from	that	well	was	the	 reckless 	 ness 	 	with	which	that	power	was	 unleash 	 ed 	 	--	the	 care 	 lessness 	 	,	the	lack	of	 plan 	 ning 	 	that	 character 	 ized 	 	the	operation	from	 drill 	 ing 	 	to	clean	-	up	.
if	there	is	one	thing	bp	's	 water 	 y 	 	improv	act	made	clear	,	it	is	that	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	culture	,	we	have	 be 	 come 	 	far	too	 will 	 ing 	 	to	gamble	with	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	precious	and	 ir 	 replace 	 able 	 	,	and	to	do	so	 with 	 out 	 	a	back	-	up	plan	,	 with 	 out 	 	an	exit	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	.
and	bp	was	 hard 	 ly 	 	our	first	experience	of	 th 	 is 	 	in	 re 	 cent 	 	 year 	 s 	 	.

our	financial	 wizard 	 s 	 	 routine 	 ly 	 	fall	victim	to	similar	 over 	 confidence 	 	,	convincing	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	that	the	 lat 	 est 	 	bubble	is	a	new	kind	of	market	--	the	kind	that	never	 go 	 es 	 	down	.
and	when	it	 inevit 	 ably 	 	 do 	 es 	 	,	the	best	and	the	 bright 	 est 	 	reach	for	the	financial	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	the	junk	shot	--	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	 throw 	 ing 	 	massive	 amount 	 s 	 	of	much	-	 need 	 ed 	 	public	money	down	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	kind	of	hole	.

we	have	to	figure	out	why	we	keep	 lett 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	happen	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	are	in	the	 mid 	 st 	 	of	what	may	be	our	highest	-	 s 	 take 	 s 	 	gamble	of	all	--	 dec 	 id 	 ing 	 	what	to	do	,	or	not	to	do	,	about	climate	change	.
now	 a 	 s 	 	you	know	,	a	great	deal	of	time	is	 s 	 pent 	 	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	and	around	the	world	,	 in 	 side 	 	the	climate	debate	,
on	the	question	of	,	``	what	if	the	ipc	 scientist 	 s 	 	are	all	wrong	?	``
now	a	far	more	relevant	question	--	 a 	 s 	 	mit	physicist	evelyn	fox	keller	 put 	 s 	 	it	--	is	,	``	what	if	 t 	 hose 	 	 scientist 	 s 	 	are	right	?	``
 give 	 n 	 	the	 s 	 take 	 s 	 	,	the	climate	crisis	 clear 	 ly 	 	 call 	 s 	 	for	us	to	act	based	on	the	 pre 	 caution 	 ary 	 	principle	--	the	 theor 	 y 	 	that	 hold 	 s 	 	that	when	human	health	and	the	environment	are	 significant 	 ly 	 	at	risk	and	when	the	potential	damage	is	 ir 	 revers 	 ible 	 	,	we	can	not	afford	to	wait	for	perfect	scientific	 certain 	 ty 	 	.
better	to	 er 	 r 	 	on	the	side	of	caution	.
more	 over 	 t 	 	,	the	burden	of	 prov 	 ing 	 	that	a	practice	is	safe	should	not	be	 place 	 d 	 	on	the	public	that	would	be	 harm 	 ed 	 	,	but	 ra 	 ther 	 	on	the	industry	that	 stand 	 s 	 	to	profit	.
but	climate	policy	in	the	 wealth 	 y 	 	world	--	to	the	 ex 	 tent 	 	that	 s 	 uch 	 	a	thing	 exist 	 s 	 	--	is	not	based	on	 pre 	 caution 	 	,	but	 ra 	 ther 	 	on	cost	-	benefit	analysis	--	 find 	 ing 	 	the	course	of	action	that	 economist 	 s 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	will	have	the	 l 	 east 	 	impact	on	our	gdp	.
so	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 ask 	 ing 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 pre 	 caution 	 	would	demand	,	what	can	we	do	 a 	 s 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	possible	to	avoid	potential	 catastroph 	 e 	 	,	we	ask	bizarre	 question 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	:	``	what	is	the	 lat 	 est 	 	possible	moment	we	can	wait	before	we	begin	 serious 	 ly 	 	 lower 	 ing 	 	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	?
can	we	put	 th 	 is 	 	off	till	2020	,	2030	,	2050	?	``
or	we	ask	,	``	how	much	 hot 	 ter 	 	can	we	let	the	planet	get	and	still	 surviv 	 e 	 	?
can	we	go	with	two	 degree 	 s 	 	,	three	 degree 	 s 	 	,	or	--	where	we	're	 current 	 ly 	 	going	--	four	 degree 	 s 	 	celsius	?	``
and	by	the	way	,	the	assumption	that	we	can	 safe 	 ly 	 	control	the	earth	's	 awesome 	 ly 	 	complex	climate	system	 a 	 s 	 	if	it	had	a	 thermo 	 stat 	 	,	making	the	planet	not	too	hot	,	not	too	cold	,	but	just	right	--	sort	of	goldilocks	style	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	 pur 	 e 	 	 fanta 	 s 	 y 	 	,	and	it	's	not	coming	from	the	climate	 scientist 	 s 	 	.	it	's	coming	from	the	 economist 	 s 	 	 im 	 posing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 mechan 	 istic 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	on	the	science	.
the	fact	is	that	we	 simpl 	 y 	 	do	n't	know	when	the	 warm 	 ing 	 	that	we	create	will	be	 utter 	 ly 	 	 overwhelm 	 ed 	 	by	 feed 	 back 	 	 loop 	 s 	 	.
so	once	 aga 	 in 	 	,	why	do	we	take	these	crazy	 risk 	 s 	 	with	the	precious	?
a	range	of	 explan 	 ations 	 	may	be	 pop 	 ping 	 	 in 	 to 	 	your	mind	by	now	,	like	``	greed	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	popular	 explan 	 ation 	 	,	and	there	's	 lot 	 s 	 	of	truth	to	it	,
 be 	 cause 	 	taking	big	 risk 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	all	know	,	 pay 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	money	.
 an 	 other 	 	 explan 	 ation 	 	that	you	often	hear	for	 reckless 	 ness 	 	is	 hub 	 ris 	 	.
and	greed	and	 hub 	 ris 	 	are	 intima 	 te 	 ly 	 	 intertwine 	 d 	 	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	 reckless 	 ness 	 	.
for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	if	you	happen	to	be	a	35	-	year	-	old	 bank 	 er 	 	taking	home	100	 time 	 s 	 	more	than	a	brain	surgeon	,	then	you	need	a	narrative	,	you	need	a	story	that	 make 	 s 	 	that	 dis 	 par 	 ity 	 	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
and	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	n't	have	a	lot	of	 option 	 s 	 	.
you	're	either	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	good	scammer	,	and	you	're	 get 	 ting 	 	away	with	it	--	you	 gam 	 ed 	 	the	system	--	or	you	're	some	kind	of	boy	 gen 	 ius 	 	,	the	 like 	 s 	 	of	which	the	world	 ha 	 s 	 	never	 s 	 een 	 	.
now	both	of	these	 option 	 s 	 	--	the	boy	 gen 	 ius 	 	and	the	scammer	--	are	going	to	make	you	 vast 	 ly 	 	 over 	 confident 	 	and	 there 	 fore 	 	more	prone	to	taking	even	 big 	 ger 	 	 risk 	 s 	 	in	the	future	.
by	the	way	,	tony	hayward	,	the	 form 	 er 	 	ceo	of	bp	,	had	a	 pla 	 que 	 	on	his	desk	 in 	 scribed 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	 inspiration 	 al 	 	slogan	:	``	what	would	you	attempt	to	do	if	you	 k 	 new 	 	you	could	not	fail	?	``
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	popular	 pla 	 que 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	crowd	of	 over 	 achiev 	 ers 	 	,	so	i	'm	 bet 	 ting 	 	that	some	of	you	have	 th 	 is 	 	 pla 	 que 	 	.
do	n't	feel	 a 	 shame 	 d 	 	.
 put 	 ting 	 	fear	of	failure	out	of	your	mind	can	be	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	thing	if	you	're	training	for	a	triathlon	or	 pre 	 par 	 ing 	 	to	give	a	tedtalk	,	but	 personal 	 ly 	 	,	i	think	people	with	the	power	to	 de 	 ton 	 ate 	 	our	 eco 	 nomy 	 	and	ravage	our	 eco 	 logy 	 	would	do	better	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	picture	of	icarus	 hang 	 ing 	 	from	the	wall	,	 be 	 cause 	 	--	 may 	 be 	 	not	that	one	in	 part 	 icular 	 	--	but	i	want	them	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	failure	all	of	the	time	.
so	we	have	greed	,	we	've	got	 over 	 confidence 	 	/	 hub 	 ris 	 	,	but	since	we	're	here	at	tedwomen	,	let	's	consider	one	other	factor	that	could	be	 con 	 trib 	 uting 	 	in	some	small	way	to	 socie 	 tal 	 	 reckless 	 ness 	 	.
now	i	'm	not	going	to	 be 	 labor 	 	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	but	 stud 	 ies 	 	do	show	that	,	 a 	 s 	 	 invest 	 ors 	 	,	women	are	much	less	prone	to	taking	reckless	 risk 	 s 	 	than	men	,	 precise 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	've	 al 	 ready 	 	heard	,	women	tend	not	to	suffer	from	 over 	 confidence 	 	in	the	same	way	that	men	do	.
so	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	 be 	 ing 	 	paid	less	and	 praise 	 d 	 	less	 ha 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 up 	 side 	 s 	 	--	for	 socie 	 ty 	 	at	 l 	 east 	 	.
the	 flip 	 side 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	 constant 	 ly 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	told	that	you	are	 gift 	 ed 	 	,	 chose 	 n 	 	and	born	to	rule	 ha 	 s 	 	distinct	 socie 	 tal 	 	 down 	 side 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	problem	--	call	it	the	``	 peril 	 s 	 	of	privilege	``	--	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	us	 close 	 r 	 	,	i	think	,	to	the	root	of	our	 collect 	 ive 	 	 reckless 	 ness 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 non 	 e 	 	of	us	--	at	 l 	 east 	 	in	the	global	north	--	 n 	 either 	 	men	nor	women	,	are	fully	exempt	from	 th 	 is 	 	 mess 	 age 	 	.
here	's	what	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	.
 whet 	 her 	 	we	 active 	 ly 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	them	or	 conscious 	 ly 	 	reject	them	,	our	culture	 remain 	 s 	 	in	the	 grip 	 s 	 	of	certain	 arche 	 ty 	 pal 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	about	our	 suprem 	 acy 	 	over	 other 	 s 	 	and	over	nature	--
the	narrative	of	the	 new 	 ly 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	 front 	 ier 	 	and	the	 conquer 	 ing 	 	pioneer	,	the	narrative	of	manifest	 de 	 s 	 tin 	 y 	 	,	the	narrative	of	 apocalyp 	 s 	 e 	 	and	 salv 	 ation 	 	.
and	just	when	you	think	these	 st 	 ories 	 	are	 fad 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	and	that	we	've	gotten	over	them	,	they	pop	up	in	the	 strange 	 st 	 	 place 	 s 	 	.
for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	i	 s 	 tumble 	 d 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 advertise 	 ment 	 	 out 	 side 	 	the	women	's	 wash 	 room 	 	in	the	kansas	city	 air 	 port 	 	.
it	's	for	motorola	's	new	 rug 	 ged 	 	cell	phone	,	and	 y 	 es 	 	,	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 do 	 es 	 	say	,	``	 s 	 lap 	 	mother	nature	in	the	face	.	``
and	i	'm	not	just	 show 	 ing 	 	it	to	pick	on	motorola	--	that	's	just	a	 bon 	 us 	 	.
i	'm	 show 	 ing 	 	it	 be 	 cause 	 	--	they	're	not	a	sponsor	,	are	they	?	--	 be 	 cause 	 	,	in	 it 	 s 	 	own	way	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	crass	version	of	our	 found 	 ing 	 	story	.
we	 s 	 lap 	 ped 	 	mother	nature	around	and	won	,
and	we	 al 	 ways 	 	win	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 domin 	 ating 	 	nature	is	our	 de 	 s 	 tin 	 y 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	fairytale	we	tell	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	about	nature	.
there	's	 an 	 other 	 	one	,	 equal 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	about	how	that	 ver 	 y 	 	same	mother	nature	is	so	 nurtur 	 ing 	 	and	so	 resili 	 ent 	 	that	we	can	never	make	a	dent	in	her	abundance	.
let	's	hear	from	tony	hayward	 aga 	 in 	 	.
``	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	of	mexico	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	big	ocean	.
the	amount	of	oil	and	 dispers 	 ants 	 	that	we	are	 put 	 ting 	 	 in 	 to 	 	it	is	 tin 	 y 	 	in	relation	to	the	total	water	volume	.	``
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	the	ocean	is	big	;	she	can	take	it	.
it	is	 th 	 is 	 	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	assumption	of	 limit 	 lessness 	 	that	 make 	 s 	 	it	possible	to	take	the	reckless	 risk 	 s 	 	that	we	do	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	our	real	master	-	narrative	:
 how 	 ever 	 	much	we	mess	up	,	there	will	 al 	 ways 	 	be	more	--	more	water	,	more	land	,	more	 un 	 ta 	 pped 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	.
a	new	bubble	will	replace	the	old	one	.
a	new	technology	will	come	 a 	 long 	 	to	fix	the	 mess 	 es 	 	we	made	with	the	last	one	.
in	a	way	,	that	is	the	story	of	the	 settl 	 ing 	 	of	the	americas	,	the	 suppose 	 d 	 ly 	 	 in 	 exhaust 	 ible 	 	 front 	 ier 	 	to	which	europeans	 es 	 cap 	 ed 	 	.
and	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	the	story	of	modern	 capital 	 ism 	 	,
 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	the	wealth	from	 th 	 is 	 	land	that	 g 	 ave 	 	birth	to	our	economic	system	,	one	that	can	not	 surviv 	 e 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 perpetu 	 al 	 	growth	and	an	 un 	 end 	 ing 	 	supply	of	new	 front 	 ier 	 s 	 	.
now	the	problem	is	that	the	story	was	 al 	 ways 	 	a	lie	.
the	earth	 al 	 ways 	 	did	have	 limit 	 s 	 	.	they	 we 	 re 	 	just	beyond	our	 sight 	 s 	 	.

not	 on 	 ly 	 	do	we	 continu 	 e 	 	to	tell	and	 re 	 tell 	 	the	same	 tire 	 d 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	,	but	we	are	now	 do 	 ing 	 	so	with	a	frenzy	and	a	 fur 	 y 	 	that	,	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	 ver 	 ge 	 s 	 	on	camp	.

 ignor 	 e 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 creep 	 ing 	 	 fear 	 s 	 	that	we	have	 final 	 ly 	 	hit	the	wall	.
there	are	still	no	 limit 	 s 	 	.	there	will	 al 	 ways 	 	be	 an 	 other 	 	 front 	 ier 	 	.
so	stop	 worry 	 ing 	 	and	keep	 shop 	 ping 	 	.	now	,	would	that	 th 	 is 	 	 we 	 re 	 	just	about	sarah	palin	and	her	 re 	 ality 	 	tv	show	.
in	 environment 	 al 	 	 circle 	 s 	 	,	we	often	hear	that	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	shifting	to	 renew 	 able 	 s 	 	,	we	are	 continu 	 ing 	 	with	business	 a 	 s 	 	usual	.
 th 	 is 	 	 assess 	 ment 	 	,	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	is	far	too	 optimist 	 ic 	 	.
the	truth	is	that	we	have	 al 	 ready 	 	 exhaust 	 ed 	 	so	much	of	the	 eas 	 ily 	 	 access 	 ible 	 	fossil	 fuel 	 s 	 	that	we	have	 al 	 ready 	 	 enter 	 ed 	 	a	far	 risk 	 ier 	 	business	era	,	the	era	of	 extrem 	 e 	 	energy	.
so	that	 mean 	 s 	 	 drill 	 ing 	 	for	oil	in	the	 deep 	 est 	 	water	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	the	 ic 	 y 	 	 arc 	 tic 	 	 sea 	 s 	 	,	where	a	clean	-	up	may	 simpl 	 y 	 	be	 im 	 possible 	 	.
it	 mean 	 s 	 	large	-	scale	 hyd 	 raulic 	 	 f 	 rack 	 ing 	 	for	gas	and	massive	strip	-	 min 	 ing 	 	 operation 	 s 	 	for	coal	,	the	 like 	 s 	 	of	which	we	have	n't	yet	 s 	 een 	 	.
and	most	 controversial 	 ly 	 	,	it	 mean 	 s 	 	the	tar	 sand 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	 al 	 ways 	 	 surprise 	 d 	 	by	how	little	people	 out 	 side 	 	of	canada	know	about	the	alberta	tar	 sand 	 s 	 	,	which	 th 	 is 	 	year	are	 project 	 ed 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	the	number	one	source	of	 import 	 ed 	 	oil	to	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
it	's	worth	taking	a	moment	to	understand	 th 	 is 	 	practice	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 believ 	 e 	 	it	 speak 	 s 	 	to	 reckless 	 ness 	 	and	the	path	we	're	on	like	little	else	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	the	tar	 sand 	 s 	 	live	,	under	one	of	the	last	 magnific 	 ent 	 	boreal	 forest 	 s 	 	.
the	oil	is	not	liquid	.	you	ca	n't	just	drill	a	hole	and	pump	it	out	.
tar	sand	's	oil	is	solid	,	 mix 	 ed 	 	in	with	the	 s 	 oil 	 	.
so	to	get	at	it	,	you	first	have	to	get	rid	of	the	 tree 	 s 	 	.
then	,	you	rip	off	the	 top 	 s 	 oil 	 	and	get	at	that	 oil 	 y 	 	sand	.
the	process	 requir 	 es 	 	a	huge	amount	of	water	,	which	is	then	 pump 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	massive	toxic	 tail 	 ing 	 	 pond 	 s 	 	.
that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	bad	news	for	local	 indi 	 genous 	 	people	living	 down 	 stream 	 	who	are	 report 	 ing 	 	 alarm 	 ing 	 ly 	 	high	cancer	rates	.
now	looking	at	these	 image 	 s 	 	,	it	's	difficult	to	grasp	the	scale	of	 th 	 is 	 	operation	,	which	can	 al 	 ready 	 	be	 s 	 een 	 	from	space	and	could	grow	to	an	area	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	england	.
i	find	it	 help 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	to	look	at	the	dump	 truck 	 s 	 	that	move	the	earth	,	the	largest	ever	built	.
that	's	a	person	down	there	by	the	wheel	.
my	point	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	oil	 drill 	 ing 	 	.	it	's	not	even	 min 	 ing 	 	.
it	is	terrestrial	 skin 	 ning 	 	.
vast	,	 vivi 	 d 	 	 land 	 scapes 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 gutt 	 ed 	 	,	left	 mono 	 chromatic 	 	gray	.
now	i	should	confess	that	 a 	 s 	 	[	far	 a 	 s 	 	]	i	'm	 concern 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	would	be	an	 abo 	 min 	 ation 	 	if	it	 emit 	 ted 	 	not	one	particle	of	carbon	.
but	the	truth	is	that	,	on	average	,	 turn 	 ing 	 	that	 gun 	 k 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 crud 	 e 	 	oil	 produce 	 s 	 	about	three	 time 	 s 	 	more	 green 	 house 	 	gas	 poll 	 ution 	 	than	it	 do 	 es 	 	to	produce	 convention 	 al 	 	oil	in	canada	.
how	else	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	a	form	of	mass	 insan 	 ity 	 	?
just	when	we	know	we	need	to	be	 learn 	 ing 	 	to	live	on	the	surface	of	our	planet	,	off	the	power	of	 s 	 un 	 	,	wind	and	 wave 	 s 	 	,	we	are	 fr 	 ant 	 ically 	 	 dig 	 ging 	 	to	get	at	the	 dirt 	 iest 	 	,	highest	-	 emit 	 ting 	 	stuff	 imagin 	 able 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	where	our	story	of	 end 	 less 	 	growth	 ha 	 s 	 	taken	us	,	to	 th 	 is 	 	black	hole	at	the	center	of	my	country	--	a	place	of	 s 	 uch 	 	planetary	pain	that	,	like	the	bp	 gush 	 er 	 	,	one	can	 on 	 ly 	 	stand	to	look	at	it	for	so	long	.
 a 	 s 	 	jared	diamond	and	 other 	 s 	 	have	 show 	 n 	 	us	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	commit	 su 	 icide 	 	,	by	 s 	 lam 	 ming 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	foot	on	the	 accele 	 rator 	 	at	the	exact	moment	when	they	should	be	 put 	 ting 	 	on	the	 brake 	 s 	 	.
the	problem	is	that	our	master	-	narrative	 ha 	 s 	 	an	answer	for	that	too	.
at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	last	minute	,	we	are	going	to	get	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	just	like	in	every	hollywood	movie	,	just	like	in	the	 rap 	 ture 	 	.
but	,	of	course	,	our	secular	 relig 	 ion 	 	is	technology	.
now	,	you	may	have	 notice 	 d 	 	more	and	more	 head 	 lines 	 	like	these	.
the	idea	 be 	 hind 	 	 th 	 is 	 	form	of	``	 geo 	 engineer 	 ing 	 	``	 a 	 s 	 	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	,	is	that	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	planet	 heat 	 s 	 	up	,	we	may	be	able	to	shoot	 s 	 ul 	 fate 	 s 	 	and	 a 	 lumin 	 um 	 	 particle 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 strato 	 sphere 	 	to	reflect	some	of	the	 s 	 un 	 	's	 ray 	 s 	 	back	to	space	,	 there 	 by 	 	 cool 	 ing 	 	the	planet	.
the	 wack 	 iest 	 	plan	--	and	i	'm	not	making	 th 	 is 	 	up	--	would	put	what	is	 essential 	 ly 	 	a	garden	hose	18	-	and	-	a	-	half	 mile 	 s 	 	high	 in 	 to 	 	the	sky	,	 suspend 	 ed 	 	by	 balloon 	 s 	 	,	to	spew	sulfur	 di 	 oxide 	 	.
so	,	solving	the	problem	of	 poll 	 ution 	 	with	more	 poll 	 ution 	 	.
think	of	it	 a 	 s 	 	the	ultimate	junk	shot	.
the	serious	 scientist 	 s 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	research	all	stress	that	these	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	are	 entire 	 ly 	 	 un 	 tested 	 	.
they	do	n't	know	if	they	'll	work	,	and	they	have	no	idea	what	kind	of	 terrify 	 ing 	 	side	 effect 	 s 	 	they	could	unleash	.
 never 	 the 	 less 	 	,	the	mere	 ment 	 ion 	 	of	 geo 	 engineer 	 ing 	 	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 greet 	 ed 	 	in	some	 circle 	 s 	 	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	media	 circle 	 s 	 	,	with	a	relief	 ting 	 ed 	 	with	euphoria	.
an	 es 	 cape 	 	hatch	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 reach 	 ed 	 	.
a	new	 front 	 ier 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	found	.
most	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	we	do	n't	have	to	change	our	 life 	 style 	 s 	 	after	all	.
you	see	,	for	some	people	,	 the 	 ir 	 	savior	is	a	guy	in	a	 flow 	 ing 	 	robe	.
for	other	people	,	it	's	a	guy	with	a	garden	hose	.
we	 bad 	 ly 	 	need	some	new	 st 	 ories 	 	.
we	need	 st 	 ories 	 	that	have	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	heroes	 will 	 ing 	 	to	take	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 risk 	 s 	 	--	 risk 	 s 	 	that	confront	 reckless 	 ness 	 	head	on	,	that	put	the	 pre 	 caution 	 ary 	 	principle	 in 	 to 	 	practice	,	even	if	that	 mean 	 s 	 	through	direct	action	--	like	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	young	people	 will 	 ing 	 	to	get	 arrest 	 ed 	 	,	 block 	 ing 	 	 dirt 	 y 	 	power	 plant 	 s 	 	or	 fight 	 ing 	 	 mountain 	 top 	 	-	removal	coal	 min 	 ing 	 	.
