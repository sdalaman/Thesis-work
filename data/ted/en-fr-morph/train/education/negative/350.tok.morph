i	'm	a	,	or	was	,	or	kind	of	am	a	 to 	 y 	 	 design 	 er 	 	.
and	before	i	was	a	 to 	 y 	 	 design 	 er 	 	,	oh	,	i	was	a	 mim 	 e 	 	,	a	street	 mim 	 e 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
and	then	i	was	an	 entertain 	 er 	 	,	i	guess	.
and	before	that	,	i	was	a	 silver 	 smith 	 	,	and	before	that	,	i	was	--	i	was	out	of	the	house	at	about	15	and	a	half	,	and	i	never	wound	up	going	 in 	 to 	 	college	.
i	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	--	i	did	n't	see	the	point	at	the	time	.
i	do	now	,	after	 learn 	 ing 	 	about	all	the	 quant 	 um 	 	stuff	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	show	you	a	little	bit	about	the	world	of	 to 	 y 	 	design	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	from	my	small	aperture	of	the	world	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	video	i	made	when	i	first	 start 	 ed 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 to 	 y 	 	design	.
i	'm	in	my	 gar 	 age 	 	,	making	weird	stuff	.
and	then	you	go	to	these	 to 	 y 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	and	there	's	some	guy	 a 	 cross 	 	the	table	,	and	he	 go 	 es 	 	,	``	pass	.	pass	.	pass	.	``
you	know	,	you	think	it	's	so	cool	,	but	they	--	 any 	 way 	 	,	i	made	 th 	 is 	 	little	tape	that	i	'd	 al 	 ways 	 	show	when	i	go	in	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	name	of	my	company	,	giving	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	.
so	i	used	to	work	at	mattel	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
and	after	i	left	mattel	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	all	these	 ham 	 burger 	 	makers	,
and	then	got	the	 licens 	 e 	 	to	make	the	maker	.	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ham 	 burger 	 	maker	that	you	take	the	peanut	butter	and	stuff	and	you	put	it	in	there	,	and	it	 make 	 s 	 	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	french	fry	maker	,	little	,	 tin 	 y 	 	food	you	can	eat	.
i	beat	up	the	 past 	 a 	 	maker	to	make	that	.
then	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	mcnugget	maker	,	i	think	.
 th 	 is 	 	,	now	that	's	the	mcnugget	maker	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	 old 	 est 	 	daughter	making	a	mcapple	pie	.
and	let	's	see	,	you	can	make	the	pie	and	 ci 	 nna 	 mon 	 	and	sugar	,	and	then	you	eat	,	and	you	eat	,	and	you	eat	,	and	you	--	she	's	about	300	 pound 	 s 	 	now	.
no	,	she	's	not	,	she	's	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	how	they	 look 	 ed 	 	when	they	came	out	at	the	end	.
these	are	a	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	like	a	15	million	dollar	line	.
and	it	got	me	through	some	--	i	did	n't	make	any	 royal 	 ties 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	it	got	me	through	.
next	is	a	 compil 	 ation 	 	of	a	bunch	of	stuff	.
that	was	a	 mis 	 s 	 ile 	 	foam	 launch 	 er 	 	that	did	n't	get	 s 	 old 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 squish 	 y 	 	head	,	for	no	 ap 	 parent 	 	reason	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	some	 effect 	 s 	 	that	i	did	for	``	wig	,	rattle	and	roll	.	``	that	was	a	robot	eye	thing	 controll 	 ing 	 	it	in	the	back	.
that	paid	the	rent	for	about	a	month	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 walk 	 ing 	 	barbie	--	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	oh	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	it	!	``
and	they	go	,	``	oh	,	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	nice	,	``	and	out	it	 go 	 es 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	some	 fight 	 ing 	 	 robot 	 s 	 	.	i	thought	 every 	 one 	 	would	want	these	.
they	fight	,	they	get	back	up	,	you	know	?	would	n't	 th 	 is 	 	be	cool	?
and	they	made	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	 to 	 y 	 	,	and	then	they	 drop 	 ped 	 	it	like	a	hot	rock	.
they	're	 pre 	 tty 	 	cool	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	--	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	some	flight	-	 test 	 ing 	 	on	my	little	 p 	 ug 	 	,	 see 	 ing 	 	if	 th 	 is 	 	can	 re 	 ally 	 	grab	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	.
i	'm	using	little	phone	 connect 	 ors 	 	to	make	them	so	they	can	spin	.
it	's	how	they	,	see	,	have	 t 	 hose 	 	 al 	 bum 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	--	 kid 	 s 	 	do	n't	know	what	they	are	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	clay	maker	.
you	know	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	--	i	went	to	play	-	doh	,	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	look	,	i	can	animate	 th 	 is 	 	.	``
they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	do	n't	talk	to	us	about	play	-	doh	.	``
and	then	,	i	made	a	lego	 anim 	 ator 	 	.
i	thought	,	 th 	 is 	 	would	be	so	great	!
and	you	know	,	lego	--	do	n't	take	legos	to	lego	.
that	's	the	answer	.	they	know	 every 	 thing 	 	about	it	.
then	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 animatronic 	 s 	 	.
i	 love 	 d 	 	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	.
i	used	to	be	in	the	film	business	,	kind	of	,	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	nicholas	negroponte	saw	 th 	 is 	 	when	i	was	,	like	,	12	,	and	 any 	 way 	 	,	so	then	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	you	have	to	make	two	and	they	have	to	fight	.	``
you	know	,	how	--	why	would	a	kid	want	a	dinosaur	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	me	using	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	or	3	-	d	studio	,	back	in	the	'80s	.
that	's	david	letterman	.
you	can	see	how	old	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	is	.
that	's	my	 young 	 est 	 	cousin	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	segment	 call 	 ed 	 	,	``	 danger 	 ous 	 	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	you	wo	n't	see	at	christmas	.	``
we	had	my	first	saw	blade	 launch 	 er 	 	and	we	had	a	 flame 	 throw 	 er 	 	chair	.
my	 care 	 er 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	 peak 	 ed 	 	here	.
and	in	the	back	are	foam	-	core	 cut 	 out 	 s 	 	of	the	people	who	could	n't	make	it	to	the	show	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	mek	going	through	a	 wind 	 shield 	 	 wipe 	 r 	 	motor	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	--	i	used	to	kind	of	be	an	 a 	 ctor 	 	.
and	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	not	 ver 	 y 	 	good	at	it	.
but	the	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	guy	named	dr.	yatz	,	who	would	take	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	 a 	 part 	 	and	show	 kid 	 s 	 	about	 engineer 	 ing 	 	.
and	you	can	see	the	 massive 	 ly 	 	parallel	 process 	 ing 	 	nintendos	there	.
and	over	to	the	left	is	a	view	master	of	the	cd	-	rom	.
and	a	guy	named	stan	reznikov	did	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	pilot	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	--	you	can	see	the	little	window	there	.
you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	the	steadicam	with	a	bubble	on	the	bottom	.
you	see	the	 key 	 board 	 	 s 	 trapped 	 	to	my	wrist	.
way	 a 	 head 	 	of	my	time	here	.
 nar 	 rator 	 	:	i	love	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	!
caleb	chung	:	that	's	all	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	say	there	.	i	love	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	.
ok	,	so	,	so	that	was	a	,	that	was	the	first	kind	of	a	--	that	was	the	first	batch	of	 product 	 s 	 	.
most	of	them	did	not	go	.
you	get	one	out	of	20	,	one	out	of	30	 product 	 s 	 	.
and	every	now	and	then	,	we	do	 some 	 thing 	 	like	a	,	you	know	,	an	 autom 	 ated 	 	hair	wrap	machine	,	you	know	,	that	 tangle 	 s 	 	your	hair	and	 pull 	 s 	 	your	scalp	out	,	and	--	and	we	'd	make	some	money	on	that	,	you	know	.	and	we	'd	give	it	out	.
but	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	we	left	l.a.	,	and	we	 move 	 d 	 	to	idaho	,	where	there	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	lot	of	peace	and	quiet	.
and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	project	--	oh	,	i	have	to	tell	you	about	 th 	 is 	 	real	quick	.
 through 	 out 	 	 th 	 is 	 	whole	thing	,	making	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	,	i	think	there	is	a	real	correlation	with	 innov 	 ation 	 	and	art	and	science	.
there	's	some	kind	of	a	blend	that	 happen 	 s 	 	that	 allow 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	to	find	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
and	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	sum	 th 	 is 	 	up	in	some	kind	of	symbol	that	 mean 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	,	to	me	 any 	 way 	 	.
and	so	,	art	and	science	have	a	kind	of	dynamic	balance	,	that	's	where	i	think	 innov 	 ation 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	to	me	,	how	i	can	come	up	with	great	 idea 	 s 	 	.
but	it	's	not	how	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	leverage	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	you	have	to	put	a	circle	around	that	,	and	call	it	business	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	three	together	,	i	think	,	give	you	leverage	in	the	world	.
but	moving	on	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	quick	tale	i	'm	going	to	tell	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	furby	tale	.
 a 	 s 	 	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	i	was	co	-	inventor	of	the	furby	.
i	did	the	body	and	creature	--	well	,	you	'll	see	.
so	by	way	of	 show 	 ing 	 	you	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	can	kind	of	get	an	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	what	it	is	to	,	 hope 	 fully 	 	,	try	to	create	robotic	life	 form 	 s 	 	,	or	technology	that	 ha 	 s 	 	an	 emotion 	 al 	 	 connect 	 ion 	 	with	the	user	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	family	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	my	wife	,	christi	,	and	abby	,	and	melissa	,	and	my	17	-	year	-	old	now	,	emily	,	who	was	just	a	pack	of	trouble	.
all	right	,	there	's	that	robot	 aga 	 in 	 	.
i	came	out	of	the	movie	business	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	let	's	make	these	animatronic	 robot 	 s 	 	.
let	's	make	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	so	i	've	 al 	 ways 	 	had	a	big	interest	in	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	one	 actual 	 ly 	 	did	n't	go	 any 	 where 	 	,	but	i	got	my	feet	wet	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 small 	 er 	 	one	,	and	i	have	a	little	moving	 tors 	 o 	 	on	there	.
a	little	,	 tin 	 y 	 	guy	 walk 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	.	more	 serv 	 o 	 	 drive 	 s 	 	,	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 serv 	 o 	 	 hack 	 ing 	 	,	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 mechanic 	 al 	 	stuff	.
there	's	 an 	 other 	 	one	.
he	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	skeletor	 leg 	 s 	 	,	i	think	,	he	's	 wear 	 ing 	 	there	.	oh	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	little	 p 	 ony 	 	,	little	 p 	 ony 	 	--	 ver 	 y 	 	cute	little	thing	.
the	point	of	 show 	 ing 	 	these	is	i	've	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	little	artificial	life	 piece 	 s 	 	.
so	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	was	--	i	 work 	 ed 	 	for	 micro 	 soft 	 	for	a	little	bit	,	 work 	 ing 	 	on	the	 micro 	 soft 	 	barney	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	--	you	know	,	the	 pur 	 ple 	 	dinosaur	with	kind	of	bloat	wear	.
and	,	you	know	,	they	had	 lot 	 s 	 	,	just	 lot 	 s 	 	of	stuff	in	there	that	you	did	n't	need	,	i	thought	.
and	then	 micro 	 soft 	 	can	just	fill	a	,	you	know	,	a	 ware 	 house 	 	full	of	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	and	see	if	they	sell	.
so	it	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	strange	business	model	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	coming	from	a	 to 	 y 	 	company	.
but	 any 	 way 	 	,	a	friend	of	mine	and	i	,	dave	hampton	,	 decide 	 d 	 	to	see	if	we	could	do	like	a	single	-	cell	organism	.
what	's	the	 few 	 est 	 	 piece 	 s 	 	we	could	use	to	make	a	little	life	form	?
and	that	's	our	little	,	thirty	-	cent	mabuchi	motor	.	and	so	,	i	have	all	these	design	 book 	 s 	 	,	like	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	have	.
and	 through 	 out 	 	the	 book 	 s 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	page	on	furby	--	i	have	kind	of	the	art	and	science	.
i	have	the	why	over	here	,	and	the	how	over	there	.
i	try	to	do	a	lot	of	 philosoph 	 y 	 	,	a	lot	of	 think 	 ing 	 	about	all	of	these	 project 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	not	just	``	bing	``	 idea 	 s 	 	;	you	have	to	 re 	 ally 	 	dig	deep	in	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
so	there	's	some	real	pseudo	-	code	over	here	,	and	 get 	 ting 	 	the	idea	of	different	kind	of	 drive 	 s 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	.
and	 original 	 ly 	 	,	furby	 on 	 ly 	 	had	two	 eye 	 s 	 	and	some	 batt 	 eries 	 	on	the	bottom	.
and	then	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	well	,	you	're	going	to	feed	him	,	and	he	 need 	 s 	 	to	talk	,	and	it	got	more	 complic 	 ated 	 	.
and	then	i	had	to	figure	out	how	i	'm	going	to	use	that	one	motor	to	make	the	 eye 	 s 	 	move	,	and	the	 ear 	 s 	 	move	,	and	the	body	to	move	,	and	the	mouth	to	move	.
and	,	you	know	,	i	want	to	make	it	blink	and	do	all	that	at	the	same	time	.
well	,	i	came	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	linear	 express 	 ion 	 	thing	with	these	 cam 	 s 	 	and	 feed 	 back 	 	.	and	that	 work 	 ed 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	well	.
then	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	get	a	little	more	realistic	and	i	have	to	start	 draw 	 ing 	 	the	stuff	.
and	there	's	my	``	note	to	self	``	at	the	top	:	``	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 engineer 	 ing 	 	.	``	so	that	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	a	little	more	than	true	.
there	's	my	first	 explode 	 d 	 	view	and	all	the	little	 piece 	 s 	 	and	the	little	worm	drive	and	all	that	stuff	.
and	then	i	've	got	to	start	building	it	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	real	thing	.
i	get	up	and	start	cutting	my	finger	and	 glu 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	together	.
and	that	's	my	little	 work 	 shop 	 	.
and	there	's	the	first	little	cam	that	drove	furby	.
and	there	's	furby	on	the	half	shell	.
you	can	see	the	little	bb	in	the	box	is	my	tilt	sensor	.
i	just	 bas 	 ically 	 	 gna 	 wed 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	out	of	plastic	.
so	there	's	the	back	of	his	head	with	a	billion	 hole 	 s 	 	in	it	.
and	there	i	am	.	i	'm	 d 	 one 	 	.	there	's	my	little	furby	.
no	,	it	's	a	little	robot	on	 hero 	 in 	 	or	 some 	 thing 	 	,	i	think	.
so	right	now	,	you	see	,	i	love	little	 robot 	 s 	 	.
so	my	wife	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	well	,	you	may	like	it	,	but	 no 	 body 	 	else	will	.	``
so	she	 come 	 s 	 	to	the	 rescu 	 e 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	my	wife	christi	,	who	is	just	,	you	know	,	my	muse	and	my	partner	for	 et 	 ern 	 ity 	 	here	.
and	she	 do 	 es 	 	 draw 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	right	?
she	's	an	actual	,	you	know	,	artist	.
and	she	 start 	 s 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	all	these	different	 draw 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	 do 	 es 	 	color	 pattern 	 s 	 	and	 color 	 ing 	 	 book 	 s 	 	.
and	i	like	the	guy	with	the	cigar	at	the	bottom	there	.
he	did	n't	test	so	well	,	but	i	like	him	.
and	then	she	 start 	 ed 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	these	other	 image 	 s 	 	.
at	that	time	,	beanie	 bab 	 ies 	 	was	a	big	hit	,	and	we	thought	,	we	'll	do	a	bunch	of	different	 one 	 s 	 	.
so	here	's	a	little	pink	one	,	a	little	pouf	on	his	head	.
and	here	's	--	 th 	 is 	 	did	n't	do	so	well	in	 test 	 ing 	 	either	,	i	do	n't	know	why	.
there	's	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	,	demon	furby	.
that	was	a	good	one	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	 final 	 ly 	 	 settl 	 ed 	 	on	kind	of	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	a	look	,	little	 pouf 	 y 	 	body	,	a	little	 imagin 	 ary 	 	character	.
and	there	he	is	,	a	little	bush	baby	on	--	caught	in	the	 head 	 light 	 s 	 	there	.
i	 actual 	 ly 	 	went	to	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	``	r	``	us	,	got	a	little	 fur 	 ry 	 	cat	,	 rip 	 ped 	 	it	 a 	 part 	 	and	made	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	since	then	,	every	time	i	come	home	from	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	``	r	``	us	with	 doll 	 s 	 	or	 some 	 thing 	 	,	they	disappear	from	my	desk	and	they	get	 hid 	 den 	 	in	the	house	.
i	have	three	 girl 	 s 	 	and	they	just	,	they	--	it	's	like	a	 rescu 	 e 	 	animal	thing	they	're	going	there	.
so	,	a	little	tether	coming	off	,	it	's	just	a	control	for	the	fur	's	mouth	and	his	 eye 	 s 	 	.
it	's	just	a	little	 serv 	 er 	 	control	and	i	made	a	little	video	going	:	``	hi	,	my	name	's	furby	,	and	i	'm	good	,	``	you	know	,	and	then	i	'd	reach	my	hand	.
he	'd	--	you	can	tickle	him	.	when	i	put	my	hand	up	,	``	ha	,	ha	,	ha	,	ha	``	and	that	's	how	we	 s 	 old 	 	him	.
and	hasbro	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	i	 me 	 ant 	 	tiger	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	at	the	time	,	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	,	we	want	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
we	have	,	you	know	,	13	 week 	 s 	 	or	 some 	 thing 	 	to	 to 	 y 	 	fair	,	and	we	're	going	to	hire	you	 guy 	 s 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.	``
and	so	dave	and	i	got	 work 	 ing 	 	.
 most 	 ly 	 	me	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	all	 mechanic 	 s 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	.
so	now	i	have	to	 re 	 ally 	 	figure	out	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	stuff	i	do	n't	know	how	to	do	.
and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	with	solid	 work 	 s 	 	and	a	whole	other	group	to	do	that	.
and	we	 start 	 ed 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	was	way	back	before	there	was	 re 	 ally 	 	much	sla	going	on	,	not	a	lot	of	rapid	 proto 	 ty 	 ping 	 	.
we	 certain 	 ly 	 	did	n't	have	the	money	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
they	 on 	 ly 	 	paid	me	,	like	,	a	little	bit	of	money	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	so	i	had	to	call	a	friend	of	a	friend	who	was	running	the	gm	prototype	plant	,	sla	plant	,	that	was	down	.
and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	,	well	,	we	'll	run	them	.	``
so	they	ran	all	the	 shell 	 s 	 	for	us	,	which	was	nice	of	them	.
and	the	 cam 	 s 	 	i	got	cut	at	hewlett	packard	.
we	snuck	in	on	the	 week 	 end 	 	.
and	so	we	just	had	a	 dis 	 c 	 	of	the	 file 	 s 	 	.
but	they	have	a	closed	system	,	so	you	could	n't	print	the	 thing 	 s 	 	out	on	the	machine	.
so	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 print 	 ed 	 	them	out	on	clear	and	taped	them	on	the	 monitor 	 s 	 	.
and	on	the	 week 	 end 	 	we	ran	the	 part 	 s 	 	for	that	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	they	come	out	close	to	the	end	.
and	then	they	 look 	 ed 	 	like	little	garfields	there	.
eight	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	--	you	may	remember	 th 	 is 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	--	total	,	total	,	total	 cha 	 os 	 	.
for	a	while	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	making	two	million	furbys	a	month	.
they	 actual 	 ly 	 	wound	up	 do 	 ing 	 	about	40	million	furbys	.
i	--	it	's	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	how	--	i	do	n't	know	how	that	can	be	.
and	hasbro	made	about	,	you	know	,	a	billion	and	a	half	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
and	i	just	a	little	bit	on	each	one	.
so	full	circle	--	why	do	i	do	 th 	 is 	 	?
why	do	you	,	you	know	,	try	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	?
and	it	's	,	of	course	,	for	your	 kid 	 s 	 	.
and	there	's	my	 young 	 est 	 	daughter	with	her	furbys	.
and	she	still	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	.
so	i	kind	of	 retire 	 d 	 	,	and	we	're	 al 	 ready 	 	living	in	 para 	 dis 	 e 	 	up	in	boise	,	on	a	river	,	you	know	.	so	and	then	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 an 	 other 	 	company	 call 	 ed 	 	 to 	 y 	 	 innov 	 ation 	 	and	we	did	some	 project 	 s 	 	with	mattel	with	 actual 	 ly 	 	with	a	 lad 	 y 	 	who	's	here	,	 iv 	 y 	 	ross	,	and	we	did	miracle	 move 	 s 	 	baby	,	made	it	in	wired	magazine	,	did	a	bunch	of	other	stuff	.
and	then	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 an 	 other 	 	company	.
we	did	a	little	hand	-	held	 de 	 vice 	 	for	 teen 	 s 	 	that	could	hook	up	to	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	won	``	best	 innov 	 ations 	 	``	at	ces	,	but	 re 	 ally 	 	i	kind	of	 s 	 low 	 ed 	 	down	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	ok	,
i	just	...	after	a	while	,	i	had	 th 	 is 	 	old	tape	of	 th 	 is 	 	dinosaur	,	and	i	 g 	 ave 	 	it	to	 th 	 is 	 	guy	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	other	guy	saw	it	,	and	then	people	 start 	 ed 	 	to	want	to	do	it	.
and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	they	'd	 s 	 pend 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	time	.
so	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	ok	,	let	's	try	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	dinosaur	project	.	``
the	crazy	idea	is	we	're	going	to	try	to	clone	a	dinosaur	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	we	can	with	 to 	 day 	 	's	technology	.
and	it	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	--	but	 a 	 s 	 	close	 a 	 s 	 	we	can	do	.
and	we	're	going	to	try	to	 re 	 ally 	 	pull	 th 	 is 	 	off	,	 intent 	 fully 	 	try	to	make	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 seem 	 s 	 	like	it	's	 al 	 ive 	 	.
not	a	robot	that	kind	of	 do 	 es 	 	,	but	let	's	 re 	 ally 	 	go	for	it	.
so	i	 pick 	 ed 	 	a	camarasaurus	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	camarasaurus	was	the	most	abundant	of	the	 sauropod 	 s 	 	in	north	america	.
and	you	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	find	full	fossil	evidence	of	these	.
that	's	a	juvenile	.
and	so	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	went	in	.
there	's	a	book	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 walk 	 ing 	 	on	eggshells	,	``	where	they	found	actual	sauropod	skin	in	patagonia	.
and	the	picture	from	the	book	,	so	when	i	--	i	told	the	 sculpt 	 or 	 	to	use	 th 	 is 	 	bump	pattern	,	 what 	 ever 	 	you	can	to	copy	that	.
 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 obsess 	 ive 	 	.
there	's	a	kind	of	 trunc 	 ated 	 	camarasaurus	skeleton	,	but	the	 geo 	 metry 	 	's	correct	.
and	then	i	went	in	,	and	 measur 	 ed 	 	all	the	 geo 	 metry 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 figur 	 ed 	 	,	 he 	 y 	 	,	 bio 	 mimicry 	 	.	if	i	do	it	kind	of	right	,	it	might	move	kind	of	like	the	real	thing	.
so	there	's	the	motor	.
and	about	 th 	 is 	 	time	,	you	know	,	all	these	other	people	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	help	.
here	's	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	what	we	did	with	the	skull	.
there	's	the	skull	,	there	's	my	 draw 	 ing 	 	of	a	skull	.
there	's	kind	of	the	skin	version	of	the	soft	tissue	.
there	's	the	 mechan 	 ism 	 	that	would	go	in	there	,	kind	of	a	geneva	drive	.
there	's	some	solid	 work 	 s 	 	 version 	 s 	 	of	it	.
here	's	some	sla	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	same	thing	.
and	then	,	these	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 crud 	 e 	 	 piece 	 s 	 	.	we	 we 	 re 	 	just	 do 	 ing 	 	some	 test 	 s 	 	here	.
there	's	the	skull	,	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	the	same	shape	 a 	 s 	 	the	camarasaurus	.
there	's	a	 photo 	 realistic 	 	eye	 be 	 hind 	 	a	lens	.
and	there	's	kind	of	the	first	 explode 	 d 	 	view	,	or	see	-	through	view	.
there	's	the	first	sla	version	,	and	it	 al 	 ready 	 	kind	of	 ha 	 s 	 	the	feel	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	kind	of	a	 cute 	 ness 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	.
and	the	thing	about	 blend 	 ing 	 	science	and	art	in	 th 	 is 	 	 multi 	 disciplinary 	 	stuff	is	you	can	do	a	robot	,	and	then	you	go	back	and	do	the	shape	,	and	then	you	go	back	and	forth	.
the	 serv 	 os 	 	in	the	front	 leg 	 s 	 	,	we	had	to	shape	 t 	 hose 	 	like	 muscle 	 s 	 	.
they	had	to	fit	 with 	 in 	 	the	 envelop 	 e 	 	.
there	was	a	tremendous	amount	of	work	to	get	all	that	 work 	 ing 	 	right	.
all	the	neck	and	the	tail	are	cable	,	so	it	 move 	 s 	 	 smooth 	 ly 	 	and	 organ 	 ically 	 	.
and	then	,	of	course	,	you	're	not	 d 	 one 	 	yet	.
you	have	to	get	the	look	for	the	skin	.
the	skin	's	a	whole	 an 	 other 	 	thing	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	 hard 	 est 	 	part	.
so	you	hire	 artist 	 s 	 	,	and	you	try	to	get	the	look	and	feel	of	the	character	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	--	we	're	character	 design 	 ers 	 	,	right	?
and	we	're	still	 try 	 ing 	 	to	keep	with	the	real	character	.
so	,	now	you	go	back	and	you	cover	the	whole	thing	with	clay	.
now	you	start	 do 	 ing 	 	the	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	you	can	see	we	got	a	guy	from	--	who	's	just	a	fanatic	about	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	to	do	the	 sculpt 	 ing 	 	for	us	,	down	to	the	spoon	-	shaped	 tee 	 th 	 	and	 every 	 thing 	 	.
and	then	more	 sculpt 	 ing 	 	,	and	then	more	 sculpt 	 ing 	 	,	and	then	more	 sculpt 	 ing 	 	,	and	then	more	 sculpt 	 ing 	 	.
and	then	,	four	 year 	 s 	 	and	10	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	we	have	a	little	pleo	.
john	,	do	you	want	to	 br 	 ing 	 	him	up	?
john	sosoka	is	our	cto	,	and	is	 re 	 ally 	 	the	man	that	's	 d 	 one 	 	most	of	the	work	with	our	40	-	person	company	.
i	'd	like	to	give	john	a	hand	.	he	never	 get 	 s 	 	 re 	 cognition 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	john	sosoka	.
so	,	thank	you	,	john	,	thank	you	,
and	get	back	to	work	,	all	right	,	man	?
all	right	--	--	no	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 pain 	 ful 	 	,	so	--	--	these	are	little	pleos	and	you	can	 prob 	 ably 	 	see	them	.
 th 	 is 	 	--	i	on	purpose	--	they	go	through	life	 stage 	 s 	 	.
so	when	you	first	get	them	,	they	're	 bab 	 ies 	 	.
and	you	--	more	you	have	them	,	kind	of	the	 old 	 er 	 	they	get	,	and	they	kind	of	learn	through	 the 	 ir 	 	behavior	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	 th 	 is 	 	one	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 a 	 sleep 	 	,	and	--	hang	on	.	pleo	,	wake	up	.	pleo	,	come	on	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	guy	's	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	my	voice	here	.
but	they	have	40	 sensor 	 s 	 	all	over	 the 	 ir 	 	body	.
they	have	seven	 processor 	 s 	 	,	they	have	14	 motor 	 s 	 	,	they	have	--	but	you	do	n't	care	,	do	you	?
they	're	just	cute	,	right	?	that	's	the	idea	,	that	's	the	idea	.
so	you	see	--	 he 	 y 	 	,	come	on	.	 he 	 y 	 	,	did	you	feel	that	?
there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	big	and	loud	over	here	.
 he 	 y 	 	.
that	's	good	,	wake	up	,	wake	up	,	wake	up	.
 yea 	 h 	 	,	they	're	like	 kid 	 s 	 	,	you	know	.
you	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	 yea 	 h 	 	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	he	's	 hung 	 ry 	 	.
i	'll	show	you	what	he	's	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	for	,	for	four	 year 	 s 	 	.
here	,	here	,	here	.	have	some	money	,	pleo	.
there	you	go	.
that	's	what	the	 invest 	 ors 	 	think	,	that	it	's	just	--	--	right	,	right	.	so	they	're	 re 	 ally 	 	sweet	little	 guy 	 s 	 	.
and	we	're	 hop 	 ing 	 	that	--	you	know	,	our	belief	is	that	 human 	 s 	 	need	to	feel	 empath 	 y 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	in	order	to	be	more	human	.
and	we	think	we	can	help	that	out	by	 hav 	 ing 	 	little	 creature 	 s 	 	that	you	can	love	.
now	these	are	not	 robot 	 s 	 	,	they	're	kind	of	 love 	 bots 	 	,	you	know	.
they	do	change	over	time	.
but	 most 	 ly 	 	they	evoke	a	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	 car 	 ing 	 	.
and	we	have	a	--	i	have	a	little	 some 	 thing 	 	here	.
now	i	do	want	to	say	that	,	you	know	,	ugobe	is	not	there	yet	.
we	've	just	 open 	 ed 	 	the	door	,	and	it	's	for	all	of	you	to	step	through	it	.
we	did	include	some	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 hope 	 fully 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	.
excuse	me	,	pleo	.
they	--	he	 ha 	 s 	 	a	usb	and	he	 ha 	 s 	 	a	sd	card	,	so	it	's	 complete 	 ly 	 	open	 architect 	 ure 	 	.
so	 any 	 one 	 	can	plug	him	--	--	thank	you	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	john	over	here	.
 any 	 one 	 	can	take	pleo	and	they	can	 total 	 ly 	 	 re 	 do 	 	his	 personal 	 ity 	 	.
you	can	make	him	 bi 	 polar 	 	,	or	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 one 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	a	--	--	you	can	change	his	 home 	 o 	 static 	 	 drive 	 s 	 	,	or	 what 	 ever 	 	you	want	to	call	them	.
 kid 	 s 	 	can	just	drag	and	drop	,	put	in	new	 sound 	 s 	 	.
we	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	keep	people	from	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
we	have	one	 anim 	 ator 	 	who	's	taken	it	and	he	's	 d 	 one 	 	a	take	on	the	budweiser	beer	commercial	,	and	they	're	going	,	``	whassup	,	``	you	know	?
you	--	so	it	's	--	 y 	 es 	 	,	he	 like 	 s 	 	that	.
so	they	're	a	 hand 	 ful 	 	.	we	hope	you	get	one	.
i	do	n't	know	what	i	'm	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	to	say	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	a	last	thing	,	i	'd	like	to	say	is	that	if	we	 continu 	 e 	 	 a 	 long 	 	 th 	 is 	 	path	,	we	are	 design 	 ing 	 	our	children	's	best	 friend 	 s 	 	.
and	there	's	a	lot	of	social	 respons 	 ibility 	 	in	that	.
that	's	why	pleo	's	soft	and	gentle	and	loving	.
and	so	i	just	--	i	hope	we	all	dream	well	.
thank	you	.
