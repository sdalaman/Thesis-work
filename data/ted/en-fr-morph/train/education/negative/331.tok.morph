so	,	people	 argu 	 e 	 	 vigor 	 ously 	 	about	the	definition	of	life	.
they	ask	if	it	should	have	 re 	 production 	 	in	it	,	or	 metabol 	 ism 	 	,	or	evolution	.
and	i	do	n't	know	the	answer	to	that	,	so	i	'm	not	going	to	tell	you	.
i	will	say	that	life	 involve 	 s 	 	computation	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	computer	program	.
booted	up	in	a	cell	,	the	program	would	execute	,	and	it	could	result	in	 th 	 is 	 	person	;	or	with	a	small	change	,	it	could	result	in	 th 	 is 	 	person	;	or	 an 	 other 	 	small	change	,	 th 	 is 	 	person	;	or	with	a	 large 	 r 	 	change	,	 th 	 is 	 	dog	,	or	 th 	 is 	 	tree	,	or	 th 	 is 	 	whale	.	so	now	,	if	you	take	 th 	 is 	 	metaphor	[	of	]	genome	 a 	 s 	 	program	 serious 	 ly 	 	,	you	have	to	consider	that	chris	anderson	is	a	computer	-	 fabric 	 ated 	 	artifact	,	 a 	 s 	 	is	jim	watson	,	craig	venter	,	 a 	 s 	 	are	all	of	us	.
and	in	convincing	 your 	 self 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	metaphor	is	true	,	there	are	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 similar 	 ities 	 	between	genetic	 program 	 s 	 	and	computer	 program 	 s 	 	that	could	help	to	 con 	 vince 	 	you	.
but	one	,	to	me	,	that	's	most	 compel 	 ling 	 	is	the	peculiar	 sensitiv 	 ity 	 	to	small	 change 	 s 	 	that	can	make	large	 change 	 s 	 	in	 bio 	 logical 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	--	the	 out 	 put 	 	.
a	small	mutation	can	take	a	two	-	wing	fly	and	make	it	a	four	-	wing	fly	.
or	it	could	take	a	fly	and	put	 leg 	 s 	 	where	 it 	 s 	 	 antenna 	 e 	 	should	be	.
or	if	you	're	familiar	with	``	the	 prince 	 s 	 s 	 	 brid 	 e 	 	,	``	it	could	create	a	six	-	fingered	man	.
now	,	a	 hall 	 mark 	 	of	computer	 program 	 s 	 	is	just	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 sensitiv 	 ity 	 	to	small	 change 	 s 	 	.
if	your	bank	account	's	one	dollar	,	and	you	flip	a	single	bit	,	you	could	end	up	with	a	thousand	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
so	these	small	 change 	 s 	 	are	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	think	that	--	they	 indic 	 ate 	 	to	us	that	a	 complic 	 ated 	 	computation	in	 develop 	 ment 	 	is	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	these	 ampl 	 ified 	 	,	large	 change 	 s 	 	.
so	now	,	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	 indic 	 ates 	 	that	there	are	 mole 	 cular 	 	 program 	 s 	 	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	biology	,	and	it	 show 	 s 	 	the	power	of	 mole 	 cular 	 	 program 	 s 	 	--	biology	 do 	 es 	 	.
and	what	i	want	to	do	is	write	 mole 	 cular 	 	 program 	 s 	 	,	 potential 	 ly 	 	to	build	technology	.	and	there	are	a	lot	of	people	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	a	lot	of	synthetic	 biologist 	 s 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	like	craig	venter	.	and	they	 concent 	 rate 	 	on	using	 cell 	 s 	 	.
they	're	cell	-	oriented	.
so	my	 friend 	 s 	 	,	 mole 	 cular 	 	 programm 	 ers 	 	,	and	i	have	a	sort	of	biomolecule	-	centric	approach	.
we	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	using	dna	,	rna	and	protein	,	and	building	new	 language 	 s 	 	for	building	 thing 	 s 	 	from	the	bottom	up	,	using	 bio 	 molecule 	 s 	 	,	 potential 	 ly 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	biology	.
so	,	these	are	all	the	 machine 	 s 	 	in	a	cell	.
there	's	a	camera	.
there	's	the	solar	 pan 	 el 	 s 	 	of	the	cell	,	some	 s 	 witch 	 es 	 	that	turn	your	 gene 	 s 	 	on	and	off	,	the	 gird 	 ers 	 	of	the	cell	,	 motor 	 s 	 	that	move	your	 muscle 	 s 	 	.
my	little	group	of	 mole 	 cular 	 	 programm 	 ers 	 	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 re 	 fashion 	 	all	of	these	 part 	 s 	 	from	dna	.
we	're	not	dna	 zeal 	 ot 	 s 	 	,	but	dna	is	the	 cheap 	 est 	 	,	 eas 	 iest 	 	to	understand	and	easy	to	program	material	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	other	 thing 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 eas 	 ier 	 	to	use	--	 may 	 be 	 	protein	--	we	'll	work	with	 t 	 hose 	 	.
if	we	succeed	,	what	will	 mole 	 cular 	 	 programm 	 ing 	 	look	like	?
you	're	going	to	 s 	 it 	 	in	front	of	your	computer	.
you	're	going	to	design	 some 	 thing 	 	like	a	cell	phone	,	and	in	a	high	-	level	language	,	you	'll	 de 	 scribe 	 	that	cell	phone	.
then	you	're	going	to	have	a	 compil 	 er 	 	that	's	going	to	take	that	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	and	it	's	going	to	turn	it	 in 	 to 	 	actual	 molecule 	 s 	 	that	can	be	 s 	 ent 	 	to	a	 synthesize 	 r 	 	and	that	 synthesize 	 r 	 	will	pack	 t 	 hose 	 	 molecule 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	seed	.
and	what	 happen 	 s 	 	if	you	water	and	feed	that	seed	 appropriate 	 ly 	 	,	is	it	will	do	a	 develop 	 mental 	 	computation	,	a	 mole 	 cular 	 	computation	,	and	it	'll	build	an	 electron 	 ic 	 	computer	.
and	if	i	have	n't	 reveal 	 ed 	 	my	 prejudice 	 s 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	,	i	think	that	life	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	about	 mole 	 cular 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	building	 electro 	 chemical 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	,	building	 electron 	 ic 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	,	which	together	with	 electro 	 chemical 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	will	build	new	 mole 	 cular 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	,	which	will	build	new	 electron 	 ic 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	,	and	so	forth	.
and	if	you	buy	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	you	think	life	is	about	computation	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	do	,	then	you	look	at	big	 question 	 s 	 	through	the	 eye 	 s 	 	of	a	computer	scientist	.
so	one	big	question	is	,	how	 do 	 es 	 	a	baby	know	when	to	stop	growing	?
and	for	 mole 	 cular 	 	 programm 	 ing 	 	,	the	question	is	how	 do 	 es 	 	your	cell	phone	know	when	to	stop	growing	?
or	how	 do 	 es 	 	a	computer	program	know	when	to	stop	running	?
or	more	to	the	point	,	how	do	you	know	if	a	program	will	ever	stop	?
there	are	other	 question 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	too	.
one	of	them	is	craig	venter	's	question	.
 turn 	 s 	 	out	i	think	he	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	computer	scientist	.
he	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	how	big	is	the	minimal	genome	that	will	give	me	a	 function 	 ing 	 	 micro 	 organism 	 	?
how	few	 gene 	 s 	 	can	i	use	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	 analog 	 ous 	 	to	the	question	,	what	's	the	 small 	 est 	 	program	i	can	write	that	will	act	 exact 	 ly 	 	like	 micro 	 soft 	 	word	?
and	just	 a 	 s 	 	he	's	writing	,	you	know	,	bacteria	that	will	be	 small 	 er 	 	,	he	's	writing	 genome 	 s 	 	that	will	work	,	we	could	write	 small 	 er 	 	 program 	 s 	 	that	would	do	what	 micro 	 soft 	 	word	 do 	 es 	 	.
but	for	 mole 	 cular 	 	 programm 	 ing 	 	,	our	question	is	,	how	 man 	 y 	 	 molecule 	 s 	 	do	we	need	to	put	in	that	seed	to	get	a	cell	phone	?
what	's	the	 small 	 est 	 	number	we	can	get	away	with	?
now	,	these	are	big	 question 	 s 	 	in	computer	science	.
these	are	all	 complex 	 ity 	 	 question 	 s 	 	,	and	computer	science	 tell 	 s 	 	us	that	these	are	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	 question 	 s 	 	.
 al 	 most 	 	--	 man 	 y 	 	of	them	are	 im 	 possible 	 	.
but	for	some	 task 	 s 	 	,	we	can	start	to	answer	them	.
so	,	i	'm	going	to	start	 ask 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 question 	 s 	 	for	the	dna	 structure 	 s 	 	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	next	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	normal	dna	,	what	you	think	of	 a 	 s 	 	normal	dna	.
it	's	double	-	 strand 	 ed 	 	,	it	's	a	double	 hel 	 ix 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	the	 a 	 s 	 	,	ts	,	cs	and	gs	that	pair	to	hold	the	 strand 	 s 	 	together	.
and	i	'm	going	to	draw	it	like	 th 	 is 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	just	so	i	do	n't	 s 	 care 	 	you	.
we	want	to	look	at	individual	 strand 	 s 	 	and	not	think	about	the	double	 hel 	 ix 	 	.
when	we	synthesize	it	,	it	 come 	 s 	 	single	-	 strand 	 ed 	 	,	so	we	can	take	the	blue	strand	in	one	tube	and	make	an	 o 	 range 	 	strand	in	the	other	tube	,	and	they	're	 flop 	 py 	 	when	they	're	single	-	 strand 	 ed 	 	.
you	mix	them	together	and	they	make	a	rigid	double	 hel 	 ix 	 	.
now	for	the	last	25	 year 	 s 	 	,	ned	seeman	and	a	bunch	of	his	 descend 	 ants 	 	have	 work 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	and	made	 beaut 	 iful 	 	three	-	dimensional	 structure 	 s 	 	using	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 re 	 action 	 	of	dna	 strand 	 s 	 	coming	together	.
but	a	lot	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 approach 	 es 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	elegant	,	take	a	long	time	.
they	can	take	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	or	it	can	be	difficult	to	design	.
so	i	came	up	with	a	new	method	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	i	call	dna	origami	that	's	so	easy	you	could	do	it	at	home	in	your	kitchen	and	design	the	stuff	on	a	 lap 	 top 	 	.
but	to	do	it	,	you	need	a	long	,	single	strand	of	dna	,	which	is	 technical 	 ly 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	to	get	.
so	,	you	can	go	to	a	natural	source	.
you	can	look	in	 th 	 is 	 	computer	-	 fabric 	 ated 	 	artifact	,	and	he	's	got	a	double	-	 strand 	 ed 	 	genome	--	that	's	no	good	.
you	look	in	his	 intestine 	 s 	 	.	there	are	 billion 	 s 	 	of	bacteria	.
they	're	no	good	either	.
double	strand	 aga 	 in 	 	,	but	 in 	 side 	 	them	,	they	're	 infect 	 ed 	 	with	a	virus	that	 ha 	 s 	 	a	nice	,	long	,	single	-	 strand 	 ed 	 	genome
that	we	can	fold	like	a	piece	of	paper	.	and	here	's	how	we	do	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	part	of	that	genome	.
we	add	a	bunch	of	short	,	synthetic	dnas	that	i	call	 staple 	 s 	 	.
each	one	 ha 	 s 	 	a	left	half	that	 bind 	 s 	 	the	long	strand	in	one	place	,	and	a	right	half	that	 bind 	 s 	 	it	in	a	different	place	,	and	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	the	long	strand	together	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
the	net	action	of	 man 	 y 	 	of	these	on	that	long	strand	is	to	fold	it	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	a	 rect 	 angle 	 	.
now	,	we	ca	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	take	a	movie	of	 th 	 is 	 	process	,	but	shawn	douglas	at	harvard	 ha 	 s 	 	made	a	nice	 visual 	 ization 	 	for	us	that	 begin 	 s 	 	with	a	long	strand	and	 ha 	 s 	 	some	short	 strand 	 s 	 	in	it	.
and	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	that	we	mix	these	 strand 	 s 	 	together	.
we	heat	them	up	,	we	add	a	little	bit	of	salt	,	we	heat	them	up	to	 al 	 most 	 	 boil 	 ing 	 	and	cool	them	down	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	we	cool	them	down	,	the	short	 strand 	 s 	 	bind	the	long	 strand 	 s 	 	and	start	to	form	structure	.	and	you	can	see	a	little	bit	of	double	 hel 	 ix 	 	 form 	 ing 	 	there	.
when	you	look	at	dna	origami	,	you	can	see	that	what	it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	you	think	it	's	 complic 	 ated 	 	,	is	a	bunch	of	double	 hel 	 ice 	 s 	 	that	are	parallel	to	each	other	,	and	they	're	held	together	by	 place 	 s 	 	where	short	 strand 	 s 	 	go	 a 	 long 	 	one	 hel 	 ix 	 	and	then	jump	to	 an 	 other 	 	one	.
so	there	's	a	strand	that	 go 	 es 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	 go 	 es 	 	 a 	 long 	 	one	 hel 	 ix 	 	and	 bind 	 s 	 	--	it	 jump 	 s 	 	to	 an 	 other 	 	 hel 	 ix 	 	and	 come 	 s 	 	back	.	that	 hold 	 s 	 	the	long	strand	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
now	,	to	show	that	we	could	make	any	shape	or	pattern	that	we	 want 	 ed 	 	,	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	shape	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	fold	dna	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 go 	 es 	 	up	over	the	eye	,	down	the	nose	,	up	the	nose	,	around	the	 fore 	 head 	 	,	back	down	and	end	in	a	little	loop	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	so	,	i	thought	,	if	 th 	 is 	 	could	work	,	 any 	 thing 	 	could	work	.
so	i	had	the	computer	program	design	the	short	 staple 	 s 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	 order 	 ed 	 	them	;	they	came	by	fedex	.
i	 mix 	 ed 	 	them	up	,	heated	them	,	 cool 	 ed 	 	them	down	,	and	i	got	50	billion	little	smiley	 face 	 s 	 	 float 	 ing 	 	around	in	a	single	drop	of	water	.
and	each	one	of	these	is	just	one	-	 thousand 	 th 	 	the	width	of	a	human	hair	,	ok	?
so	,	they	're	all	 float 	 ing 	 	around	in	solution	,	and	to	look	at	them	,	you	have	to	get	them	on	a	surface	where	they	stick	.
so	,	you	pour	them	out	onto	a	surface	and	they	start	to	stick	to	that	surface	,	and	we	take	a	picture	using	an	atomic	-	force	 micro 	 scope 	 	.
it	's	got	a	needle	,	like	a	record	needle	,	that	 go 	 es 	 	back	and	forth	over	the	surface	,	 bump 	 s 	 	up	and	down	,	and	 feel 	 s 	 	the	height	of	the	first	surface	.
it	 feel 	 s 	 	the	dna	origami	.
there	's	the	atomic	-	force	 micro 	 scope 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	and	you	can	see	that	the	 land 	 ing 	 	's	a	little	rough	.
when	you	zoom	in	,	they	've	got	,	you	know	,	weak	 jaw 	 s 	 	that	flip	over	 the 	 ir 	 	 head 	 s 	 
and	some	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 nose 	 s 	 	get	 punch 	 ed 	 	out	,	but	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	.
you	can	zoom	in	and	even	see	the	extra	little	loop	,	 th 	 is 	 	little	nano	-	goatee	.
now	,	what	's	great	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	 any 	 body 	 	can	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	so	,	i	got	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	mail	about	a	year	after	i	did	 th 	 is 	 	,	 un 	 solicit 	 ed 	 	.
 any 	 one 	 	know	what	 th 	 is 	 	is	?	what	is	it	?
it	's	 chin 	 a 	 	,	right	?
so	,	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	is	,	a	graduate	student	in	 chin 	 a 	 	,	lulu	qian	,	did	a	great	job	.
she	wrote	all	her	own	 soft 	 ware 	 	to	design	and	built	 th 	 is 	 	dna	origami	,	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 rend 	 ition 	 	of	 chin 	 a 	 	,	which	even	 ha 	 s 	 	taiwan	,	and	you	can	see	it	's	sort	of	on	the	world	's	 short 	 est 	 	leash	,	right	?
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	 work 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	well	and	you	can	make	 pattern 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 shape 	 s 	 	,	ok	?
and	you	can	make	a	map	of	the	americas	and	spell	dna	with	dna	.
and	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	neat	about	it	--
well	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	all	 look 	 s 	 	like	nano	-	 art 	 work 	 	,	but	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	nano	-	 art 	 work 	 	is	just	what	you	need	to	make	nano	-	 circuit 	 s 	 	.
so	,	you	can	put	circuit	 component 	 s 	 	on	the	 staple 	 s 	 	,	like	a	light	bulb	and	a	light	 s 	 witch 	 	.
let	the	thing	assemble	,	and	you	'll	get	some	kind	of	a	circuit	.
and	then	you	can	 may 	 be 	 	wash	the	dna	away	and	have	the	circuit	left	over	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	some	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	of	mine	at	caltech	did	.
they	took	a	dna	origami	,	 organize 	 d 	 	some	carbon	nano	-	 tube 	 s 	 	,	made	a	little	 s 	 witch 	 	,	you	see	here	,	wired	it	up	,	tested	it	and	 show 	 ed 	 	that	it	is	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	a	 s 	 witch 	 	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	a	single	 s 	 witch 	 	and	you	need	half	a	billion	for	a	computer	,	so	we	have	a	long	way	to	go	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	promising	 be 	 cause 	 	the	origami	can	organize	 part 	 s 	 	just	one	-	tenth	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	in	a	normal	computer	.
so	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	promising	for	making	small	 computer 	 s 	 	.
now	,	i	want	to	get	back	to	that	 compil 	 er 	 	.
the	dna	origami	is	a	proof	that	that	 compil 	 er 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 work 	 s 	 	.
so	,	you	start	with	 some 	 thing 	 	in	the	computer	.
you	get	a	high	-	level	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	of	the	computer	program	,	a	high	-	level	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	of	the	origami	.
you	can	 compil 	 e 	 	it	to	 molecule 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 end 	 	it	to	a	 synthesize 	 r 	 	,	and	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 work 	 s 	 	.
and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	a	company	 ha 	 s 	 	made	a	nice	program	that	's	much	better	than	my	code	,	which	was	kind	of	 ug 	 ly 	 	,	and	will	allow	us	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	in	a	nice	,	visual	,	computer	-	aided	design	way	.
so	,	now	you	can	say	,	all	right	,	why	is	n't	dna	origami	the	end	of	the	story	?
you	have	your	 mole 	 cular 	 	 compil 	 er 	 	,	you	can	do	 what 	 ever 	 	you	want	.
the	fact	is	that	it	 do 	 es 	 	not	scale	.
so	if	you	want	to	build	a	human	from	dna	origami	,	the	problem	is	,	you	need	a	long	strand	that	's	10	trillion	trillion	 base 	 s 	 	long	.
that	's	three	light	 year 	 s 	 	'	worth	of	dna	,	so	we	're	not	going	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
we	're	going	to	turn	to	 an 	 other 	 	technology	,	 call 	 ed 	 	 algorithm 	 ic 	 	self	-	 assem 	 bly 	 	of	 tile 	 s 	 	.
it	was	 start 	 ed 	 	by	erik	winfree	,	and	what	it	 do 	 es 	 	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 tile 	 s 	 	that	are	a	 hundred 	 th 	 	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	dna	origami	.
you	zoom	in	,	there	are	just	four	dna	 strand 	 s 	 	and	they	have	little	single	-	 strand 	 ed 	 	bits	on	them	that	can	bind	to	other	 tile 	 s 	 	,	if	they	match	.
and	we	like	to	draw	these	 tile 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	little	 square 	 s 	 	.
and	if	you	look	at	 the 	 ir 	 	 stick 	 y 	 	 end 	 s 	 	,	these	little	dna	bits	,	you	can	see	that	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	form	a	 check 	 er 	 board 	 	pattern	.
so	,	these	 tile 	 s 	 	would	make	a	 complic 	 ated 	 	,	self	-	 assem 	 bling 	 	 check 	 er 	 board 	 	.
and	the	point	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	if	you	did	n't	catch	that	,	is	that	 tile 	 s 	 	are	a	kind	of	 mole 	 cular 	 	program	and	they	can	 out 	 put 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	.
and	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	any	computer	program	can	be	 transl 	 ated 	 	 in 	 to 	 	one	of	these	tile	 program 	 s 	 	--	 specific 	 ally 	 	,	 count 	 ing 	 	.	so	,	you	can	come	up	with	a	set	of	 tile 	 s 	 	that	when	they	come	together	,	form	a	little	 bin 	 ary 	 	counter	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	a	 check 	 er 	 board 	 	.
so	you	can	read	off	 bin 	 ary 	 	 number 	 s 	 	five	,	six	and	seven	.
and	in	order	to	get	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 computation 	 s 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	right	,	you	need	some	kind	of	 in 	 put 	 	,	a	kind	of	seed	.
you	can	use	dna	origami	for	that	.
you	can	encode	the	number	32	in	the	right	-	hand	side	of	a	dna	origami	,	and	when	you	add	 t 	 hose 	 	 tile 	 s 	 	that	count	,	they	will	start	to	count	--	they	will	read	that	32
and	they	'll	stop	at	32	.
so	,	what	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	is	we	've	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	a	way	to	have	a	 mole 	 cular 	 	program	know	when	to	stop	going	.
it	 know 	 s 	 	when	to	stop	growing	 be 	 cause 	 	it	can	count	.
it	 know 	 s 	 	how	big	it	is	.
so	,	that	 answer 	 s 	 	that	sort	of	first	question	i	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	tell	us	how	 bab 	 ies 	 	do	it	,	 how 	 ever 	 	.
so	now	,	we	can	use	 th 	 is 	 	 count 	 ing 	 	to	try	and	get	at	much	 big 	 ger 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	than	dna	origami	could	 other 	 wise 	 	.
here	's	the	dna	origami	,	and	what	we	can	do	is	we	can	write	32	on	both	 edge 	 s 	 	of	the	dna	origami	,	and	we	can	now	use	our	 water 	 ing 	 	can	and	water	with	 tile 	 s 	 	,	and	we	can	start	growing	 tile 	 s 	 	off	of	that	and	create	a	square	.
the	counter	 serve 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	template	to	fill	in	a	square	in	the	middle	of	 th 	 is 	 	thing	.
so	,	what	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	is	we	've	 succeed 	 ed 	 	in	making	 some 	 thing 	 	much	 big 	 ger 	 	than	a	dna	origami	by	 comb 	 in 	 ing 	 	dna	origami	with	 tile 	 s 	 	.
and	the	neat	thing	about	it	is	,	is	that	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 re 	 programm 	 able 	 	.
you	can	just	change	a	couple	of	the	dna	 strand 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 bin 	 ary 	 	 represent 	 ation 	 	and	you	'll	get	96	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	32	.
and	if	you	do	that	,	the	origami	's	the	same	 s 	 ize 	 	,	but	the	 result 	 ing 	 	square	that	you	get	is	three	 time 	 s 	 	 big 	 ger 	 	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	 recapitulate 	 s 	 	what	i	was	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	about	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
you	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	sensitive	computer	program	where	small	 change 	 s 	 	--	single	,	 tin 	 y 	 	,	little	 mutation 	 s 	 	--	can	take	 some 	 thing 	 	that	made	one	 s 	 ize 	 	square	and	make	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	 big 	 ger 	 	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	--	using	 count 	 ing 	 	to	compute	and	build	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 develop 	 mental 	 	process	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 al 	 so 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 bear 	 ing 	 	on	craig	venter	's	question	.
so	,	you	can	ask	,	how	 man 	 y 	 	dna	 strand 	 s 	 	are	 requir 	 ed 	 	to	build	a	square	of	a	 give 	 n 	 	 s 	 ize 	 	?
if	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	make	a	square	of	 s 	 ize 	 	10	,	100	or	1,000	,	if	we	used	dna	origami	 al 	 one 	 	,	we	would	 requir 	 e 	 	a	number	of	dna	 strand 	 s 	 	that	's	the	square	of	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	that	square	;	so	we	'd	need	100	,	10,000	or	a	million	dna	 strand 	 s 	 	.
that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	not	 afford 	 able 	 	.
but	if	we	use	a	little	computation	--	we	use	origami	,	plus	some	 tile 	 s 	 	that	count	--	then	we	can	get	away	with	using	100	,	200	or	300	dna	 strand 	 s 	 	.
and	so	we	can	 exponential 	 ly 	 	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	number	of	dna	 strand 	 s 	 	we	use	,	if	we	use	 count 	 ing 	 	,	if	we	use	a	little	bit	of	computation	.
and	so	computation	is	some	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	way	to	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	number	of	 molecule 	 s 	 	you	need	to	build	 some 	 thing 	 	,	to	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	genome	that	you	're	building	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	i	'm	going	to	get	back	to	that	sort	of	crazy	idea	about	 computer 	 s 	 	building	 computer 	 s 	 	.
if	you	look	at	the	square	that	you	build	with	the	origami	and	some	 counter 	 s 	 	growing	off	it	,	the	pattern	that	it	 ha 	 s 	 	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	pattern	that	you	need	to	make	a	 memor 	 y 	 	.
so	if	you	 af 	 fix 	 	some	 wire 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 witch 	 es 	 	to	 t 	 hose 	 	 tile 	 s 	 	--	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	to	the	staple	 strand 	 s 	 	,	you	 af 	 fix 	 	them	to	the	 tile 	 s 	 	--	then	they	'll	self	-	assemble	the	 some 	 what 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	 circuit 	 s 	 	,	the	demultiplexer	 circuit 	 s 	 	,	that	you	need	to	address	 th 	 is 	 	 memor 	 y 	 	.
so	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	make	a	 complic 	 ated 	 	circuit	using	a	little	bit	of	computation	.
it	's	a	 mole 	 cular 	 	computer	building	an	 electron 	 ic 	 	computer	.
now	,	you	ask	me	,	how	far	have	we	gotten	down	 th 	 is 	 	path	?
 experiment 	 ally 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	in	the	last	year	.
here	is	a	dna	origami	 rect 	 angle 	 	,	and	here	are	some	 tile 	 s 	 	growing	from	it	.
and	you	can	see	how	they	count	.
one	,	two	,	three	,	four	,	five	,	six	,	nine	,	10	,	11	,	12	,	17	.
so	it	's	got	some	 error 	 s 	 	,	but	at	 l 	 east 	 	it	 count 	 s 	 	up	.
so	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	 th 	 is 	 	idea	nine	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	that	's	about	the	time	constant	for	how	long	it	 take 	 s 	 	to	do	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	,	so	i	think	we	made	a	lot	of	progress	.
we	've	got	 idea 	 s 	 	about	how	to	fix	these	 error 	 s 	 	.
and	i	think	in	the	next	five	or	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	'll	make	the	kind	of	 square 	 s 	 	that	i	 de 	 scribed 	 	and	 may 	 be 	 	even	get	to	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	self	-	 assemble 	 d 	 	 circuit 	 s 	 	.
so	now	,	what	do	i	want	you	to	take	away	from	 th 	 is 	 	talk	?
i	want	you	to	remember	that	to	create	life	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 divers 	 e 	 	and	complex	 form 	 s 	 	,	life	uses	computation	to	do	that	.
and	the	 computation 	 s 	 	that	it	uses	,	they	're	 mole 	 cular 	 	 computation 	 s 	 	,
and	in	order	to	understand	 th 	 is 	 	and	get	a	better	handle	on	it	,	 a 	 s 	 	feynman	 s 	 aid 	 	,	you	know	,	we	need	to	build	 some 	 thing 	 	to	understand	it	.
and	so	we	are	going	to	use	 molecule 	 s 	 	and	 re 	 fashion 	 	 th 	 is 	 	thing	,	 re 	 build 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	from	the	bottom	up	,	using	dna	in	ways	that	nature	never	 intend 	 ed 	 	,	using	dna	origami	,	and	dna	origami	to	seed	 th 	 is 	 	 algorithm 	 ic 	 	self	-	 assem 	 bly 	 	.
you	know	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	 ver 	 y 	 	cool	,	but	what	i	'd	like	you	to	take	from	the	talk	,	 hope 	 fully 	 	from	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	big	 question 	 s 	 	,	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	 mole 	 cular 	 	 programm 	 ing 	 	is	n't	just	about	making	 gadget 	 s 	 	.
it	's	not	just	making	about	--	it	's	making	self	-	 assemble 	 d 	 	cell	 phone 	 s 	 	and	 circuit 	 s 	 	.
what	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	about	is	taking	computer	science	and	looking	at	big	 question 	 s 	 	in	a	new	light	,	 ask 	 ing 	 	new	 version 	 s 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	big	 question 	 s 	 	and	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	how	biology	can	make	 s 	 uch 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.	thank	you	.
