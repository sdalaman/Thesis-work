 to 	 day 	 	i	'm	going	to	take	you	on	a	voyage	to	some	place	so	deep	,	so	dark	,	so	 un 	 explore 	 d 	 	that	we	know	less	about	it	than	we	know	about	the	dark	side	of	the	moon	.
it	's	a	place	of	myth	and	legend	.
it	's	a	place	 mark 	 ed 	 	on	ancient	 map 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	``	here	be	 mon 	 sters 	 	.	``
it	is	a	place	where	each	new	voyage	of	exploration	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	back	new	 discover 	 ies 	 	of	 creature 	 s 	 	so	 won 	 dr 	 ous 	 	and	strange	that	our	 fore 	 father 	 s 	 	would	have	 consider 	 ed 	 	them	 monstr 	 ous 	 	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	they	just	make	me	green	with	 en 	 vy 	 	that	my	 col 	 league 	 	from	iucn	was	able	to	go	on	 th 	 is 	 	journey	to	the	south	of	madagascar	 sea 	 mount 	 s 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	take	 photograph 	 s 	 	and	to	see	these	 won 	 dr 	 ous 	 	 creature 	 s 	 	of	the	deep	.
we	are	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	high	 sea 	 s 	 	.
the	``	high	 sea 	 s 	 	``	is	a	legal	term	,	but	in	fact	,	it	 cover 	 s 	 	50	percent	of	the	planet	.
with	an	average	depth	of	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	of	4,000	 meter 	 s 	 	,	in	fact	,	the	high	 sea 	 s 	 	 cover 	 s 	 	and	 provide 	 s 	 	 near 	 ly 	 	90	percent	of	the	 habit 	 at 	 	for	life	on	 th 	 is 	 	earth	.
it	is	,	in	 theor 	 y 	 	,	the	global	 common 	 s 	 	,	 belong 	 ing 	 	to	us	all	.
but	in	 re 	 ality 	 	,	it	is	 manage 	 d 	 	by	and	for	 t 	 hose 	 	who	have	the	 resource 	 s 	 	to	go	out	and	exploit	it	.
so	 to 	 day 	 	i	'm	going	to	take	you	on	a	voyage	to	cast	light	on	some	of	the	 out 	 d 	 ated 	 	 myth 	 s 	 	and	 legend 	 s 	 	and	 assumption 	 s 	 	that	have	 ke 	 pt 	 	us	 a 	 s 	 	the	true	 s 	 take 	 holder 	 s 	 	in	the	high	 sea 	 s 	 	in	the	dark	.
we	're	going	to	voyage	to	some	of	these	special	 place 	 s 	 	that	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 discover 	 ing 	 	in	the	past	few	 year 	 s 	 	to	show	why	we	 re 	 ally 	 	need	to	care	.
and	then	 final 	 ly 	 	,	we	're	going	to	try	to	develop	and	pioneer	a	new	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	on	high	 sea 	 s 	 	 govern 	 ance 	 	that	's	 root 	 ed 	 	in	ocean	-	basin	-	wide	 conserv 	 ation 	 	,	but	 frame 	 d 	 	in	an	arena	of	global	 norm 	 s 	 	of	 pre 	 caution 	 	and	respect	.
so	here	is	a	picture	of	the	high	 sea 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 s 	 een 	 	from	above	--	that	area	in	the	 dark 	 er 	 	blue	.
to	me	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	 inter 	 national 	 	lawyer	,	 th 	 is 	 	 scar 	 ed 	 	me	far	more	than	any	of	the	 creature 	 s 	 	or	the	 mon 	 sters 	 	we	may	have	 s 	 een 	 	,	for	it	 bel 	 ies 	 	the	 not 	 ion 	 	that	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	protect	the	ocean	,	the	global	ocean	,	that	 provide 	 s 	 	us	all	with	carbon	 s 	 to 	 rage 	 	,	with	heat	 s 	 to 	 rage 	 	,	with	oxygen	,	if	you	can	 on 	 ly 	 	protect	36	percent	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	the	true	heart	of	the	planet	.
some	of	the	 problem 	 s 	 	that	we	have	to	confront	are	that	the	current	 inter 	 national 	 	 law 	 s 	 	--	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 ship 	 ping 	 	--	provide	more	 protect 	 ion 	 	to	the	 area 	 s 	 	 close 	 st 	 	to	shore	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	garbage	 dis 	 charge 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	you	would	think	just	 simpl 	 y 	 	 go 	 es 	 	away	,	but	the	 law 	 s 	 	 regulat 	 ing 	 	ship	 dis 	 charge 	 	of	garbage	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	 weak 	 er 	 	the	further	you	are	from	shore	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	result	,	we	have	garbage	 patch 	 es 	 	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	twice	-	texas	.
it	's	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	.
we	used	to	think	the	solution	to	 poll 	 ution 	 	was	 dil 	 ution 	 	,	but	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 prov 	 ed 	 	to	be	no	 long 	 er 	 	the	case	.
so	what	we	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	social	 scientist 	 s 	 	and	 economist 	 s 	 	like	elinor	ostrom	,	who	are	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	the	 phenomen 	 on 	 	of	management	of	the	 common 	 s 	 	on	a	local	scale	,	is	that	there	are	certain	 pre 	 requisite 	 s 	 	that	you	can	put	 in 	 to 	 	place	that	 en 	 able 	 	you	to	manage	and	access	open	space	for	the	good	of	one	and	all	.
and	these	include	a	sense	of	 share 	 d 	 	 respons 	 ibility 	 	,	common	 norm 	 s 	 	that	bind	people	together	 a 	 s 	 	a	community	.
 condition 	 al 	 	access	:	you	can	 invit 	 e 	 	people	in	,	but	they	have	to	be	able	to	play	by	the	 rule 	 s 	 	.
and	of	course	,	if	you	want	people	to	play	by	the	 rule 	 s 	 	,	you	still	need	an	effective	system	of	 monitor 	 ing 	 	and	 enforce 	 ment 	 	,	for	 a 	 s 	 	we	've	 discover 	 ed 	 	,	you	can	trust	,	but	you	 al 	 so 	 	need	to	 ver 	 ify 	 	.
what	i	'd	 al 	 so 	 	like	to	convey	is	that	it	is	not	all	doom	and	gloom	that	we	are	 see 	 ing 	 	in	the	high	 sea 	 s 	 	.
for	a	group	of	 ver 	 y 	 	 dedicate 	 d 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	--	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	 conserv 	 ation 	 ists 	 	,	 photograph 	 ers 	 	and	 state 	 s 	 	--	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	change	a	tragic	 tra 	 ject 	 ory 	 	that	was	 destroy 	 ing 	 	fragile	 sea 	 scapes 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	coral	garden	that	you	see	in	front	of	you	.
that	is	,	we	're	able	to	 s 	 ave 	 	it	from	a	fate	of	deep	-	sea	bottom	 trawl 	 ing 	 	.
and	how	did	we	do	that	?
well	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	we	had	a	group	of	 photograph 	 ers 	 	that	went	out	on	board	 ship 	 s 	 	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	 photograph 	 ed 	 	the	 activ 	 ities 	 	in	process	.
but	we	 al 	 so 	 	 s 	 pent 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 hour 	 s 	 	in	the	 base 	 ments 	 	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	work	with	 government 	 s 	 	to	make	them	understand	what	was	going	on	so	far	away	from	land	that	few	of	us	had	ever	even	 imagin 	 ed 	 	that	these	 creature 	 s 	 	 exist 	 ed 	 	.
so	 with 	 in 	 	three	 year 	 s 	 	,	from	2003	to	2006	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	get	norm	in	place	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 change 	 d 	 	the	paradigm	of	how	 fish 	 ers 	 	went	about	deep	-	sea	bottom	 trawl 	 ing 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	``	go	 any 	 where 	 	,	do	 any 	 thing 	 	you	want	,	``	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 create 	 d 	 	a	regime	that	 requir 	 ed 	 	prior	 assess 	 ment 	 	of	where	you	're	going	and	a	duty	to	prevent	significant	harm	.
in	2009	,	when	the	u.n.	 review 	 ed 	 	progress	,	they	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	 al 	 most 	 	100	million	square	-	 kilometer 	 s 	 	of	 sea 	 bed 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	 protect 	 ed 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	not	mean	that	it	's	the	final	solution	,	or	that	 th 	 is 	 	even	 provide 	 s 	 	permanent	 protect 	 ion 	 	.	but	what	it	 do 	 es 	 	mean	is	that	a	group	of	 individual 	 s 	 	can	form	a	community	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	shape	the	way	high	 sea 	 s 	 	are	 govern 	 ed 	 	,	to	create	a	new	regime	.
so	i	'm	looking	 optimist 	 ically 	 	at	our	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	for	creating	a	true	,	blue	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	planet	.
sylvia	's	wish	 provide 	 s 	 	us	with	that	leverage	,	that	access	to	the	heart	of	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	you	might	say	,	who	have	 rare 	 ly 	 	 s 	 een 	 	 place 	 s 	 	beyond	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 to 	 es 	 	,	but	are	now	 hope 	 fully 	 	going	to	 be 	 come 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	full	life	-	cycle	of	 creature 	 s 	 	like	these	sea	 turtle 	 s 	 	,	who	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	 s 	 pend 	 	most	of	 the 	 ir 	 	time	in	the	high	 sea 	 s 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	we	're	just	going	to	voyage	to	a	small	 s 	 ampl 	 ing 	 	of	some	of	these	special	 area 	 s 	 	,	just	to	give	you	an	idea	of	the	flavor	of	the	 rich 	 es 	 	and	 wonder 	 s 	 	they	do	contain	.
the	sargasso	sea	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	is	not	a	sea	 bound 	 ed 	 	by	 coast 	 lines 	 	,	but	it	is	 bound 	 ed 	 	by	 ocean 	 ic 	 	 current 	 s 	 	that	contain	and	 envelop 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	wealth	of	 s 	 ar 	 g 	 assum 	 	that	 grow 	 s 	 	and	 aggreg 	 ates 	 	there	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	known	 a 	 s 	 	the	 spawn 	 ing 	 	ground	for	 eel 	 s 	 	from	 north 	 ern 	 	european	and	 north 	 ern 	 	american	 river 	 s 	 	that	are	now	so	 dwindl 	 ing 	 	in	 number 	 s 	 	that	they	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	 stop 	 ped 	 	 show 	 ing 	 	up	in	stockholm	,
and	five	 show 	 ed 	 	up	in	the	u.k.	just	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	.
but	the	sargasso	sea	,	the	same	way	it	 aggreg 	 ates 	 	 s 	 ar 	 g 	 assum 	 	weed	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	is	 pull 	 ing 	 	in	the	plastic	from	 through 	 out 	 	the	region	.
 th 	 is 	 	picture	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 exact 	 ly 	 	show	the	 plastic 	 s 	 	that	i	would	like	it	to	show	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	have	n't	 be 	 en 	 	out	there	 my 	 self 	 	.
but	there	 ha 	 s 	 	just	 be 	 en 	 	a	 stud 	 y 	 	that	was	released	in	february	that	 show 	 ed 	 	there	are	200,000	 piece 	 s 	 	of	plastic	per	square	-	kilometer	now	 float 	 ing 	 	in	the	surface	of	the	sargasso	sea	,	and	that	is	 affect 	 ing 	 	the	 habit 	 at 	 	for	the	 man 	 y 	 	species	in	 the 	 ir 	 	juvenile	 stage 	 s 	 	who	come	to	the	sargasso	sea	for	 it 	 s 	 	 protect 	 ion 	 	and	 it 	 s 	 	food	.
the	sargasso	sea	is	 al 	 so 	 	a	 won 	 dr 	 ous 	 	place	for	the	 aggreg 	 ation 	 	of	these	 un 	 ique 	 	species	that	have	 develop 	 ed 	 	to	mimic	the	 s 	 ar 	 g 	 assum 	 	 habit 	 at 	 	.
it	 al 	 so 	 	 provide 	 s 	 	a	special	 habit 	 at 	 	for	these	 fly 	 ing 	 	fish	to	lay	 the 	 ir 	 	 egg 	 s 	 	.
but	what	i	'd	like	to	get	from	 th 	 is 	 	picture	is	that	we	 tru 	 ly 	 	do	have	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	launch	a	global	 initi 	 ative 	 	for	 protect 	 ion 	 	.
thus	,	the	government	of	bermuda	 ha 	 s 	 	 recogn 	 ized 	 	the	need	and	 it 	 s 	 	 respons 	 ibility 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	some	of	the	sargasso	sea	 with 	 in 	 	 it 	 s 	 	national	jurisdiction	--	but	the	vast	 major 	 ity 	 	is	beyond	--	to	help	 spear 	 head 	 	a	 move 	 ment 	 	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	 protect 	 ion 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	vital	area	.
 s 	 pinning 	 	down	to	 some 	 place 	 	a	little	bit	 cool 	 er 	 	than	here	right	now	:	the	ross	sea	in	the	southern	ocean	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 ba 	 y 	 	.
it	's	 consider 	 ed 	 	high	 sea 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	continent	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	put	off	 limit 	 s 	 	to	 territ 	 orial 	 	 claim 	 s 	 	.	so	 any 	 thing 	 	in	the	water	is	 treat 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	if	it	's	the	high	 sea 	 s 	 	.
but	what	 make 	 s 	 	the	ross	sea	 import 	 ant 	 	is	the	vast	sea	of	pack	ice	that	in	the	spring	and	summer	 provide 	 s 	 	a	wealth	of	 phy 	 to 	 plankton 	 	and	 k 	 r 	 ill 	 	that	 support 	 s 	 	what	,	till	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	 virtual 	 ly 	 	 in 	 tact 	 	near	-	shore	 eco 	 system 	 	.
but	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	ccamlr	,	the	 region 	 al 	 	commission	in	charge	of	 conserv 	 ing 	 	and	 man 	 aging 	 	fish	 stock 	 s 	 	and	other	living	marine	 resource 	 s 	 	,	is	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	to	give	in	to	 fish 	 ing 	 	 interest 	 s 	 	and	 ha 	 s 	 	 author 	 ized 	 	the	expansion	of	 tooth 	 fish 	 	 fish 	 eries 	 	in	the	region	.
the	 cap 	 tain 	 	of	a	new	zealand	vessel	who	was	just	down	there	is	 report 	 ing 	 	a	significant	decline	in	the	number	of	the	ross	sea	killer	 whale 	 s 	 	,	who	are	 direct 	 ly 	 	dependent	on	the	antarctic	 tooth 	 fish 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	main	source	of	food	.
so	what	we	need	to	do	is	to	stand	up	 bold 	 ly 	 	,	 s 	 ing 	 ly 	 	and	together	,	to	push	 government 	 s 	 	,	to	push	 region 	 al 	 	 fish 	 eries 	 	management	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	,	to	declare	our	right	to	declare	certain	 area 	 s 	 	off	-	 limit 	 s 	 	to	high	 sea 	 s 	 	 fish 	 ing 	 	,	so	that	the	 free 	 dom 	 	to	fish	no	 long 	 er 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	the	 free 	 dom 	 	to	fish	 any 	 where 	 	and	 any 	 time 	 	.
coming	 close 	 r 	 	to	here	,	the	costa	rica	 dom 	 e 	 	is	a	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	area	--	 potential 	 ly 	 	year	-	round	 habit 	 at 	 	for	blue	 whale 	 s 	 	.
there	's	 en 	 ough 	 	food	there	to	last	them	the	summer	and	the	winter	long	.
but	what	's	 un 	 usual 	 	about	the	costa	rica	 dom 	 e 	 	is	,	in	fact	,	it	's	not	a	permanent	place	.
it	's	an	 ocean 	 o 	 graphic 	 	 phenomen 	 on 	 	that	 shift 	 s 	 	in	time	and	space	on	a	 season 	 al 	 	 bas 	 is 	 	.
so	,	in	fact	,	it	's	not	 permanent 	 ly 	 	in	the	high	 sea 	 s 	 	.
it	's	not	 permanent 	 ly 	 	in	the	exclusive	economic	 zone 	 s 	 	of	these	five	central	american	 count 	 ries 	 	,	but	it	 move 	 s 	 	with	the	season	.
 a 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	create	a	 challeng 	 e 	 	to	protect	,	but	we	 al 	 so 	 	have	a	 challeng 	 e 	 	 protect 	 ing 	 	the	species	that	move	 a 	 long 	 	with	it	.
we	can	use	the	same	 techno 	 logies 	 	that	 fish 	 ers 	 	use	to	identify	where	the	species	are	,	in	order	to	close	the	area	when	it	's	most	 vulner 	 able 	 	,	which	may	,	in	some	 case 	 s 	 	,	be	year	-	round	.
 get 	 ting 	 	 close 	 r 	 	to	shore	,	where	we	are	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	in	fact	taken	in	the	galapagos	.
 man 	 y 	 	species	are	headed	through	 th 	 is 	 	region	,	which	is	why	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	so	much	attention	put	 in 	 to 	 	 conserv 	 ation 	 	of	the	eastern	 tropic 	 al 	 	 pac 	 ific 	 	seascape	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 initi 	 ative 	 	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	 coordinate 	 d 	 	by	 conserv 	 ation 	 	 inter 	 national 	 	with	a	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 partner 	 s 	 	and	 government 	 s 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	try	to	 br 	 ing 	 	 integrate 	 d 	 	management	regime	 through 	 out 	 	the	area	.
that	is	,	it	 provide 	 s 	 	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	where	you	can	go	with	a	real	 region 	 al 	 	 initi 	 ative 	 	.
it	's	 protect 	 ing 	 	five	world	heritage	 s 	 ites 	 	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	the	world	heritage	convention	 do 	 es 	 	not	 recogn 	 ize 	 	the	need	to	protect	 area 	 s 	 	beyond	national	jurisdiction	,	at	present	.
so	a	place	like	the	costa	rica	 dom 	 e 	 	could	not	 technical 	 ly 	 	 qual 	 ify 	 	the	time	it	's	in	the	high	 sea 	 s 	 	.
so	what	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 suggest 	 ing 	 	is	that	we	either	need	to	amend	the	world	heritage	convention	,	so	that	it	can	adopt	and	urge	universal	 protect 	 ion 	 	of	these	world	heritage	 s 	 ites 	 	,	or	we	need	to	change	the	name	and	call	it	half	-	the	-	world	heritage	convention	.
but	what	we	 al 	 so 	 	know	is	that	species	like	these	sea	 turtle 	 s 	 	do	not	stay	put	in	the	eastern	 tropic 	 al 	 	 pac 	 ific 	 	seascape	.
these	happen	to	go	down	to	a	vast	south	 pac 	 ific 	 	 gy 	 re 	 	,	where	they	 s 	 pend 	 	most	of	 the 	 ir 	 	time	and	often	end	up	 get 	 ting 	 	 hook 	 ed 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	or	 a 	 s 	 	 by 	 catch 	 	.
so	what	i	'd	 re 	 ally 	 	like	to	suggest	is	that	we	need	to	scale	-	up	.
we	need	to	work	 local 	 ly 	 	,	but	we	 al 	 so 	 	need	to	work	ocean	-	basin	-	wide	.
we	have	the	 tool 	 s 	 	and	 techno 	 logies 	 	now	to	 en 	 able 	 	us	to	take	a	 broad 	 er 	 	ocean	-	basin	-	wide	 initi 	 ative 	 	.
we	've	heard	about	the	 tag 	 ging 	 	of	 pac 	 ific 	 	 predator 	 s 	 	project	,	one	of	the	17	census	of	marine	life	 project 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 provide 	 d 	 	us	data	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	of	 tin 	 y 	 	,	little	 soot 	 y 	 	 s 	 hear 	 water 	 s 	 	that	make	the	entire	ocean	basin	 the 	 ir 	 	home	.
they	fly	65,000	 kilometer 	 s 	 	in	less	than	a	year	.
so	we	have	the	 tool 	 s 	 	and	 treasu 	 re 	 s 	 	coming	from	the	census	of	marine	life	.
and	 it 	 s 	 	 culmin 	 ating 	 	year	that	's	going	to	be	 launch 	 ed 	 	in	october	.
so	stay	tuned	for	further	information	.
what	i	find	so	 excit 	 ing 	 	is	that	the	census	of	marine	life	 ha 	 s 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	at	more	than	the	 tag 	 ging 	 	of	 pac 	 ific 	 	 predator 	 s 	 	;	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	in	the	 re 	 ally 	 	 un 	 explore 	 d 	 	mid	-	water	column	,	where	 creature 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	 fly 	 ing 	 	sea	cucumber	have	 be 	 en 	 	found	.
and	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	,	 a 	 s 	 	iucn	,	to	team	up	with	the	census	of	marine	life	and	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 scientist 	 s 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	there	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	try	to	 transl 	 ate 	 	much	of	 th 	 is 	 	information	to	 policy 	 makers 	 	.
we	have	the	support	of	 government 	 s 	 	now	 be 	 hind 	 	us	.
we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 reveal 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	information	through	technical	 work 	 shop 	 s 	 	.
and	the	 excit 	 ing 	 	thing	is	that	we	do	have	sufficient	information	to	move	 a 	 head 	 	to	protect	some	of	these	significant	hope	 spot 	 s 	 	,	 hot 	 spot 	 s 	 	.
at	the	same	time	we	're	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	we	need	more	.	we	need	to	move	forward	.	``
but	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	have	 s 	 aid 	 	,	if	you	get	these	marine	 protect 	 ed 	 	 area 	 s 	 	,	or	a	 reason 	 able 	 	regime	for	high	 sea 	 s 	 	 fish 	 eries 	 	management	in	place	,	how	are	you	going	to	enforce	it	?
which	 lead 	 s 	 	me	to	my	second	 pass 	 ion 	 	 be 	 side 	 s 	 	ocean	science	,	which	is	 out 	 er 	 	space	technology	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	an	 astro 	 naut 	 	,	so	i	've	 constant 	 ly 	 	 follow 	 ed 	 	what	are	the	 tool 	 s 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	to	monitor	earth	from	 out 	 er 	 	space	--	and	that	we	have	 in 	 credible 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	like	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	about	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	follow	 tag 	 ged 	 	species	 through 	 out 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	life	-	 cycle 	 s 	 	in	the	open	ocean	.
we	can	 al 	 so 	 	tag	and	track	 fish 	 ing 	 	 vessel 	 s 	 	.
 man 	 y 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	have	 trans 	 ponder 	 s 	 	on	board	that	allow	us	to	find	out	where	they	are	and	even	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	.
but	not	all	the	 vessel 	 s 	 	have	 t 	 hose 	 	to	date	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	not	take	too	much	rocket	science	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	try	to	create	new	 law 	 s 	 	to	 man 	 date 	 	,	if	you	're	going	to	have	the	privilege	of	 access 	 ing 	 	our	high	 sea 	 s 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	,	we	need	to	know	--	 some 	 one 	 	 need 	 s 	 	to	know	--	where	you	are	and	what	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	.
so	it	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	me	to	my	main	take	-	home	 mess 	 age 	 	,	which	is	we	can	 a 	 vert 	 	a	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	of	the	 common 	 s 	 	.
we	can	stop	the	collision	course	of	50	percent	of	the	planet	with	the	high	 sea 	 s 	 	.
but	we	need	to	think	broad	-	scale	.	we	need	to	think	 global 	 ly 	 	.
we	need	to	change	how	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	go	about	 man 	 aging 	 	these	 resource 	 s 	 	.
we	need	to	get	the	new	paradigm	of	 pre 	 caution 	 	and	respect	.
at	the	same	time	,	we	need	to	think	 local 	 ly 	 	,	which	is	the	joy	and	marvel	of	sylvia	's	hope	spot	wish	,	is	that	we	can	shine	a	 spot 	 light 	 	on	 man 	 y 	 	of	these	 previous 	 ly 	 	 un 	 known 	 	 area 	 s 	 	,	and	to	 br 	 ing 	 	people	to	the	table	,	if	you	will	,	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	make	them	feel	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	community	that	 tru 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 s 	 take 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	future	management	.
and	third	is	that	we	need	to	look	at	ocean	-	basin	-	wide	management	.
our	species	are	ocean	-	basin	-	wide	.
 man 	 y 	 	of	the	deep	-	sea	 commun 	 ities 	 	have	genetic	 distribut 	 ion 	 	that	 go 	 es 	 	ocean	-	basin	-	wide	.
we	need	to	better	understand	,	but	we	 al 	 so 	 	need	to	start	to	manage	and	protect	.
and	in	order	to	do	that	,	you	 al 	 so 	 	need	ocean	-	basin	management	 regime 	 s 	 	.
that	is	,	we	have	 region 	 al 	 	management	 regime 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	exclusive	economic	zone	,	but	we	need	to	scale	these	up	,	we	need	to	build	 the 	 ir 	 	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	,	so	they	're	like	the	southern	ocean	,	where	they	do	have	the	two	-	pronged	 fish 	 eries 	 	and	 conserv 	 ation 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	.
so	with	that	,	i	would	just	like	to	 since 	 re 	 ly 	 	thank	and	honor	sylvia	earle	for	her	wish	,	for	it	is	 help 	 ing 	 	us	to	put	a	face	on	the	high	 sea 	 s 	 	and	the	deep	 sea 	 s 	 	beyond	national	jurisdiction	.
it	's	 help 	 ing 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	an	 in 	 credible 	 	group	of	 talent 	 ed 	 	people	together	to	 re 	 ally 	 	try	to	solve	and	penetrate	these	 problem 	 s 	 	that	have	 create 	 d 	 	our	 obstacle 	 s 	 	to	management	and	rational	use	of	 th 	 is 	 	area	that	was	once	so	far	away	and	remote	.
so	on	 th 	 is 	 	tour	,	i	hope	i	 provide 	 d 	 	you	with	a	new	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	of	the	high	 sea 	 s 	 	:	one	,	that	it	is	our	home	too	,	and	that	we	need	to	work	together	if	we	are	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	a	 sustain 	 able 	 	ocean	future	for	us	all	.
thank	you	.
