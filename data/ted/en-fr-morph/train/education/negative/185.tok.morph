you	know	,	there	's	a	small	country	 nest 	 led 	 	in	the	himalayan	 mountain 	 s 	 	,	far	from	these	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 mountain 	 s 	 	,	where	the	people	of	the	 king 	 dom 	 	of	bhutan	have	 decide 	 d 	 	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	different	,	which	is	to	measure	 the 	 ir 	 	gross	national	happiness	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 the 	 ir 	 	gross	national	product	.
and	why	not	?
after	all	,	happiness	is	not	just	a	privilege	for	the	 luck 	 y 	 	few	,	but	a	fundamental	human	right	for	all	.
and	what	is	happiness	?
happiness	is	the	 free 	 dom 	 	of	choice	.
the	 free 	 dom 	 	to	chose	where	to	live	,	what	to	do	,	what	to	buy	,	what	to	sell	,	from	whom	,	to	whom	,	when	and	how	.
where	 do 	 es 	 	choice	come	from	?
and	who	 get 	 s 	 	to	express	it	,	and	how	do	we	express	it	?
well	,	one	way	to	express	choice	is	through	the	market	.
well	-	 function 	 ing 	 	 market 	 s 	 	provide	 choice 	 s 	 	,	and	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	the	ability	to	express	one	's	 pur 	 suit 	 	for	happiness	.
the	great	indian	economist	,	amartya	sen	,	was	 a 	 ward 	 ed 	 	the	 no 	 bel 	 	prize	for	 demonst 	 rating 	 	that	famine	is	not	so	much	about	the	 avail 	 ability 	 	of	food	supply	,	but	 ra 	 ther 	 	the	ability	to	 acquir 	 e 	 	or	entitle	 one 	 self 	 	to	that	food	through	the	market	.
in	1984	,	in	what	can	 on 	 ly 	 	be	 consider 	 ed 	 	one	of	the	 great 	 est 	 	 crime 	 s 	 	of	 human 	 ity 	 	,	 near 	 ly 	 	one	million	people	 di 	 ed 	 	of	 starv 	 ation 	 	in	my	country	of	birth	,	ethiopia	.
not	 be 	 cause 	 	there	was	not	 en 	 ough 	 	food	--	 be 	 cause 	 	there	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 sur 	 plus 	 	of	food	in	the	 fertil 	 e 	 	 region 	 s 	 	of	the	south	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	country	--	but	 be 	 cause 	 	in	the	north	,	people	could	not	access	or	entitle	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	that	food	.
that	was	a	 turn 	 ing 	 	point	for	my	life	.
most	africans	 to 	 day 	 	,	by	far	,	are	 farm 	 ers 	 	.
and	most	of	africa	's	 farm 	 ers 	 	are	,	by	and	large	,	small	 farm 	 ers 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	land	that	they	 oper 	 ate 	 	,	and	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	small	 farm 	 ers 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	capital	they	have	at	 the 	 ir 	 	 dispos 	 al 	 	.
african	 agricultur 	 e 	 	 to 	 day 	 	is	among	,	or	is	,	the	most	under	-	 capital 	 ized 	 	in	the	world	.
 on 	 ly 	 	seven	percent	of	 ar 	 able 	 	land	in	africa	is	 irrig 	 ated 	 	,	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	40	percent	in	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	.
african	 farm 	 ers 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	use	some	22	 kilo 	 gram 	 s 	 	of	 fertil 	 izer 	 	per	hectare	,	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	144	in	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	.
road	density	is	six	 time 	 s 	 	 great 	 er 	 	in	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	than	it	is	in	 r 	 ural 	 	africa	.
there	are	eight	 time 	 s 	 	more	 tract 	 ors 	 	in	latin	america	,	and	three	 time 	 s 	 	more	 tract 	 ors 	 	in	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	,	than	in	africa	.
the	small	 farm 	 er 	 	in	africa	 to 	 day 	 	 live 	 s 	 	a	life	 with 	 out 	 	much	choice	,	and	 there 	 fore 	 	 with 	 out 	 	much	 free 	 dom 	 	.
his	livelihood	is	 pre 	 determine 	 d 	 	by	the	 condition 	 s 	 	of	 grind 	 ing 	 	poverty	.
he	 come 	 s 	 	to	the	market	when	 price 	 s 	 	are	 low 	 est 	 	,	with	the	meager	 fruit 	 s 	 	of	his	hard	labor	,	just	after	the	harvest	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 ha 	 s 	 	no	choice	.
she	 come 	 s 	 	back	to	the	market	some	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	when	 price 	 s 	 	are	highest	,	in	what	we	call	the	lean	season	--	when	food	is	scarce	--	 be 	 cause 	 	she	 ha 	 s 	 	to	feed	her	family	and	 ha 	 s 	 	no	choice	.
the	real	question	is	,	how	can	 market 	 s 	 	be	 develop 	 ed 	 	in	 r 	 ural 	 	africa	to	harness	the	power	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	and	 entrepreneur 	 ship 	 	that	we	know	 exist 	 s 	 	?
 an 	 other 	 	 not 	 able 	 	economist	,	theodore	schultz	,	in	1974	won	the	 no 	 bel 	 	prize	for	 demonst 	 rating 	 	that	 farm 	 ers 	 	are	efficient	,	but	poor	.
meaning	,	in	fact	,	that	 farm 	 ers 	 	are	rational	and	profit	-	minded	just	like	 every 	 body 	 	else	.
well	,	we	do	n't	need	,	now	,	any	more	 no 	 bel 	 	 prize 	 s 	 	to	know	that	 farm 	 ers 	 	want	a	fair	shake	at	the	market	and	want	to	make	money	,	just	like	 every 	 one 	 	else	.
and	one	thing	is	clear	,	which	is	at	 l 	 east 	 	now	we	know	that	africa	is	open	for	business	.
and	that	business	is	 agricultur 	 e 	 	.
over	two	 decade 	 s 	 	ago	,	the	world	 insist 	 ed 	 	to	africa	that	 market 	 s 	 	must	be	liberalized	,	that	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	must	be	 structural 	 ly 	 	 adjust 	 ed 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	that	 government 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	to	 re 	 move 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	from	the	business	of	 buy 	 ing 	 	and	selling	--	which	they	did	 ra 	 ther 	 	inefficiently	--	and	let	the	private	market	do	 it 	 s 	 	magic	.
well	,	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	over	the	last	25	 year 	 s 	 	?
did	africa	feed	 it 	 self 	 	?
did	our	 farm 	 ers 	 	turn	 in 	 to 	 	 high 	 ly 	 	productive	commercial	 act 	 ors 	 	?
i	think	we	're	all	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	know	that	,	in	fact	,	africa	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	region	in	the	world	where	 hung 	 er 	 	and	 mal 	 nutrition 	 	are	 project 	 ed 	 	to	go	up	over	the	next	10	 year 	 s 	 	,
where	the	food	import	bill	is	now	double	what	it	was	20	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,
where	food	production	per	capita	 ha 	 s 	 	stagnated	,	and	where	 fertil 	 izer 	 	use	 ha 	 s 	 	 decline 	 d 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	.
so	why	did	n't	 agricultur 	 e 	 	 market 	 s 	 	perform	to	 expect 	 ations 	 	?
the	market	 reform 	 s 	 	 prompt 	 ed 	 	by	the	west	--	and	i	've	 s 	 pent 	 	some	15	 year 	 s 	 	 travel 	 ing 	 	around	the	continent	 do 	 ing 	 	research	on	 agricultur 	 al 	 	 market 	 s 	 	,	and	have	 interview 	 ed 	 	 trade 	 rs 	 	in	10	to	15	 count 	 ries 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	continent	,	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 trade 	 rs 	 	--	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	what	went	wrong	with	our	market	reform	.
and	it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	that	the	 reform 	 s 	 	might	have	 throw 	 n 	 	the	baby	out	with	the	bath	water	.
like	 it 	 s 	 	 agricultur 	 e 	 	,	africa	's	 market 	 s 	 	are	 high 	 ly 	 	under	-	 capital 	 ized 	 	and	 in 	 efficient 	 	.
we	know	from	our	work	around	the	continent	that	 trans 	 action 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	of	 reach 	 ing 	 	the	market	,	and	the	 risk 	 s 	 	of	transacting	in	 r 	 ural 	 	,	 agricultur 	 e 	 	 market 	 s 	 	,	are	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	high	.
in	fact	,	 on 	 ly 	 	one	third	of	 agricultur 	 al 	 	 out 	 put 	 	 produce 	 d 	 	in	africa	even	 reach 	 es 	 	the	market	.
africa	's	 market 	 s 	 	are	weak	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	weak	 infra 	 structure 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 road 	 s 	 	and	 tele 	 communication 	 s 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	virtual	 ab 	 s 	 ence 	 	of	 necess 	 ary 	 	market	 institution 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	market	information	,	 grade 	 s 	 	and	 standard 	 s 	 	,	and	 reli 	 able 	 	ways	to	connect	 buy 	 ers 	 	and	sellers	.
 be 	 cause 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	 commodit 	 y 	 	 buy 	 ers 	 	and	sellers	 typical 	 ly 	 	transact	in	small	 circle 	 s 	 	,	in	narrow	 network 	 s 	 	of	people	they	know	and	trust	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	of	that	,	 a 	 s 	 	grain	 change 	 s 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	--	and	i	've	 measur 	 ed 	 	that	it	 change 	 s 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	four	,	five	 time 	 s 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	 tra 	 ject 	 ory 	 	from	the	 farm 	 er 	 	to	the	consumer	--	every	time	it	 change 	 s 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	--	and	i	've	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	all	over	 r 	 ural 	 	africa	--	it	 al 	 so 	 	 change 	 s 	 	 s 	 ack 	 s 	 	.
and	i	thought	that	was	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	peculiar	.
and	 re 	 ally 	 	 real 	 ized 	 	that	that	was	 be 	 cause 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	 trade 	 rs 	 	would	tell	me	over	and	over	--	that	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	people	know	what	they	're	 get 	 ting 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	 quant 	 ity 	 	and	the	product	quality	.
and	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	huge	 implic 	 ations 	 	for	the	ability	of	 market 	 s 	 	to	 quick 	 ly 	 	respond	to	price	 signal 	 s 	 	,	and	 situ 	 ations 	 	where	there	are	 defici 	 ts 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
it	 al 	 so 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	high	cost	 implic 	 ations 	 	.
i	have	 measur 	 ed 	 	that	26	percent	of	the	 market 	 ing 	 	margin	is	 simpl 	 y 	 	due	to	the	fact	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 ab 	 s 	 ence 	 	of	 grade 	 s 	 	and	 standard 	 s 	 	and	market	information	,	 s 	 ack 	 s 	 	have	to	be	 constant 	 ly 	 	 change 	 d 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 lead 	 s 	 	to	 ver 	 y 	 	high	 hand 	 ling 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	.
for	 the 	 ir 	 	part	,	small	 farm 	 ers 	 	,	who	produce	the	bulk	of	our	 agricultur 	 al 	 	 out 	 put 	 	in	africa	,	come	to	the	market	with	 virtual 	 ly 	 	no	information	at	all	--	blind	--
 trust 	 ing 	 	that	they	're	going	to	have	some	sort	of	demand	for	 the 	 ir 	 	produce	,	and	 complete 	 ly 	 	at	the	 merc 	 y 	 	of	the	 merchan 	 ts 	 	in	the	 on 	 ly 	 	market	,	the	 near 	 est 	 	local	market	they	know	--	where	they	're	 un 	 able 	 	to	 negoti 	 ate 	 	better	 price 	 s 	 	or	 reduc 	 e 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	risk	.
 s 	 peaking 	 	of	risk	,	we	have	 s 	 een 	 	that	price	 volatil 	 ity 	 	of	food	 crop 	 s 	 	in	africa	is	the	highest	in	the	world	.
in	africa	,	small	 farm 	 ers 	 	bear	the	 br 	 un 	 t 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	risk	.
in	fact	,	in	my	view	,	there	is	no	region	of	the	world	and	no	period	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	that	 farm 	 ers 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 expect 	 ed 	 	to	bear	the	kind	of	market	risk	that	africa	's	 farm 	 ers 	 	have	to	bear	.
and	in	my	view	,	there	is	 simpl 	 y 	 	no	place	in	the	world	that	 ha 	 s 	 	grown	 it 	 s 	 	 agricultur 	 e 	 	on	the	kind	of	risk	that	our	 farm 	 ers 	 	in	africa	 to 	 day 	 	face	.
in	ethiopia	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	the	 vari 	 ation 	 	in	 ma 	 ize 	 	 price 	 s 	 	from	year	to	year	is	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	50	percent	 annual 	 ly 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	market	risk	is	mind	-	boggling	,	and	 ha 	 s 	 	direct	 implic 	 ations 	 	for	not	 on 	 ly 	 	the	 incentive 	 s 	 	of	 farm 	 ers 	 	to	invest	in	 high 	 er 	 	 product 	 ivity 	 	technology	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	modern	 seed 	 s 	 	and	 fertil 	 izer 	 s 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	direct	 implic 	 ations 	 	for	food	security	.
to	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	between	2001	and	2002	,	ethiopian	 ma 	 ize 	 	 farm 	 ers 	 	 produce 	 d 	 	two	 year 	 s 	 	of	 bump 	 er 	 	harvest	.
that	in	turn	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	weak	 market 	 ing 	 	system	,	led	to	an	80	percent	collapse	in	 ma 	 ize 	 	 price 	 s 	 	in	the	country	.
 th 	 is 	 	made	it	unprofitable	for	some	 farm 	 ers 	 	to	even	harvest	the	grain	from	the	 field 	 s 	 	.
and	we	 calcul 	 ated 	 	that	some	300,000	 ton 	 s 	 	of	grain	was	left	in	the	 field 	 s 	 	to	rot	in	early	2002	.
not	six	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	in	july	2002	,	ethiopia	 announce 	 d 	 	a	major	food	crisis	,	to	the	same	 proportion 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	1984	:	14	million	people	at	risk	of	 starv 	 ation 	 	.
what	 al 	 so 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	that	year	is	in	the	 area 	 s 	 	where	there	 we 	 re 	 	good	 rain 	 s 	 	,	and	where	 farm 	 ers 	 	had	 previous 	 ly 	 	 produce 	 d 	 	 sur 	 plus 	 	grain	,	 farm 	 ers 	 	had	 decide 	 d 	 	to	withdraw	from	the	 fertil 	 izer 	 	market	,	not	use	 fertil 	 izer 	 	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	 drop 	 ped 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	use	of	 fertil 	 izer 	 	by	27	percent	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	tragic	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 arrest 	 ed 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	,	or	a	 bud 	 d 	 ing 	 	green	revolution	 stop 	 ped 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	 track 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	just	specific	to	ethiopia	,	but	 happen 	 s 	 	over	and	over	,	all	over	africa	.
well	,	i	'm	not	here	 to 	 day 	 	to	lament	about	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	or	 wr 	 ing 	 	my	 hand 	 s 	 	.
i	am	here	to	tell	you	that	change	is	in	the	air	.
africa	 to 	 day 	 	is	not	the	africa	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	aid	 solution 	 s 	 	,	or	cookie	-	cutter	foreign	expert	policy	 prescription 	 s 	 	.
africa	 ha 	 s 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	,	or	is	 learn 	 ing 	 	 some 	 what 	 	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	,	that	 market 	 s 	 	do	n't	happen	by	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
in	the	1980s	,	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 fashion 	 able 	 	to	talk	about	 get 	 ting 	 	 price 	 s 	 	right	.
there	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 in 	 fluent 	 ial 	 	book	about	that	,	which	was	 main 	 ly 	 	about	 get 	 ting 	 	 government 	 s 	 	out	of	the	market	.
we	now	 recogn 	 ize 	 	that	 get 	 ting 	 	 market 	 s 	 	right	is	about	not	just	price	 incentive 	 s 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 invest 	 ing 	 	in	the	right	 infra 	 structure 	 	and	the	appropriate	and	 necess 	 ary 	 	 institution 	 s 	 	to	create	the	 condition 	 s 	 	to	unleash	the	power	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	in	the	market	.
when	 condition 	 s 	 	are	right	,	we	know	and	see	that	that	 innov 	 ation 	 	is	ready	to	explode	in	 r 	 ural 	 	africa	,	just	like	 any 	 where 	 	else	.
 near 	 ly 	 	three	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	 leav 	 e 	 	my	 comfort 	 able 	 	job	 a 	 s 	 	a	world	bank	senior	economist	in	washington	and	come	back	to	my	country	of	birth	,	ethiopia	,	after	 near 	 ly 	 	30	 year 	 s 	 	 a 	 broad 	 	.
i	did	so	for	a	simple	reason	.
after	 hav 	 ing 	 	 s 	 pent 	 	more	than	a	decade	 understand 	 ing 	 	,	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	,	and	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 con 	 vince 	 	 policy 	 makers 	 	and	 donor 	 s 	 	about	what	was	wrong	with	africa	's	 agricultur 	 al 	 	 market 	 s 	 	,	i	 decide 	 d 	 	it	was	time	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	it	.
i	 current 	 ly 	 	lead	,	in	ethiopia	,	an	 excit 	 ing 	 	new	 initi 	 ative 	 	to	establish	the	first	ethiopia	 commodit 	 y 	 	 ex 	 change 	 	,	or	ecx	.
now	,	the	 commodit 	 y 	 	 ex 	 change 	 	 it 	 self 	 	,	that	 con 	 cept 	 	,	is	not	new	to	the	world	.
in	fact	,	in	1848	,	82	grain	 merchan 	 ts 	 	and	 farm 	 ers 	 	got	together	in	a	small	town	at	the	 cross 	 road 	 s 	 	of	the	illinois	river	and	lake	michigan	to	establish	a	way	to	trade	better	 among 	 st 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
that	was	,	of	course	,	the	birth	of	the	chicago	board	of	trade	,	which	is	the	most	famous	 commodit 	 y 	 	 ex 	 change 	 	in	the	world	.
the	chicago	board	of	trade	was	 establish 	 ed 	 	then	for	 precise 	 ly 	 	the	same	 reason 	 s 	 	that	our	 farm 	 ers 	 	 to 	 day 	 	would	benefit	from	a	 commodit 	 y 	 	 ex 	 change 	 	.
in	the	american	 mid 	 west 	 	,	 farm 	 ers 	 	used	to	load	grain	onto	barges	and	 s 	 end 	 	it	upriver	to	the	chicago	market	.
but	once	it	 arriv 	 ed 	 	,	if	no	 buy 	 er 	 	was	to	be	found	,	or	if	 price 	 s 	 	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 drop 	 ped 	 	,	 farm 	 ers 	 	would	incur	tremendous	 loss 	 es 	 	.
and	in	fact	,	would	even	dump	the	grain	in	lake	michigan	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 s 	 pend 	 	more	money	 transport 	 ing 	 	it	back	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 farm 	 s 	 	.
well	,	the	need	to	avoid	these	huge	 risk 	 s 	 	and	tremendous	 loss 	 es 	 	led	to	the	birth	of	the	 future 	 s 	 	market	,	and	the	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	system	of	 grad 	 ing 	 	grain	and	receipting	--	 is 	 suing 	 	 ware 	 house 	 	 receipt 	 s 	 	on	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	which	trade	could	be	 d 	 one 	 	.
from	there	,	the	 great 	 est 	 	 innov 	 ation 	 	of	all	came	about	in	 th 	 is 	 	market	,	which	is	that	 buy 	 ers 	 	and	sellers	could	transact	grain	 with 	 out 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	 physical 	 ly 	 	or	 visual 	 ly 	 	inspect	the	grain	.
that	 me 	 ant 	 	that	grain	could	be	 trade 	 d 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	tremendous	 distance 	 s 	 	,	and	even	 a 	 cross 	 	time	--	 a 	 s 	 	far	forward	 a 	 s 	 	18	 month 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	future	.
 th 	 is 	 	 innov 	 ation 	 	is	at	the	heart	of	the	 transform 	 ation 	 	of	american	 agricultur 	 e 	 	,	and	the	rise	of	chicago	to	a	global	market	,	 agricultur 	 al 	 	market	,	 super 	 power 	 	from	where	it	was	,	a	small	 region 	 al 	 	town	.
now	,	over	the	last	century	,	we	tend	to	think	of	 commodit 	 y 	 	 ex 	 change 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 pur 	 view 	 	of	western	 industrial 	 ized 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,
and	that	the	 re 	 ference 	 	 price 	 s 	 	for	cotton	,	coffee	,	cocoa	--	 product 	 s 	 	 produce 	 d 	 	 main 	 ly 	 	in	the	south	--	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 re 	 ference 	 	price	,	or	a	price	 discover 	 ed 	 	in	these	 organize 	 d 	 	 commodit 	 y 	 	 ex 	 change 	 s 	 	in	the	 north 	 ern 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	.
but	that	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	changing	.
and	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	a	shift	--	powered	 main 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	information	technology	--
a	shift	in	market	 domin 	 ance 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	 market 	 s 	 	.
and	over	the	last	decade	,	you	see	that	the	share	of	western	 ex 	 change 	 s 	 	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	u.s.	share	of	 ex 	 change 	 s 	 	in	the	world	--	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	down	by	 near 	 ly 	 	half	in	just	the	last	decade	.
 similar 	 ly 	 	,	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	explosive	growth	in	india	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	where	 r 	 ural 	 	 farm 	 ers 	 	are	using	 ex 	 change 	 s 	 	--	growing	here	over	the	last	three	 year 	 s 	 	by	270	percent	a	year	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	powered	by	low	-	cost	vsat	technology	,	 aggress 	 ively 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	reach	 farm 	 ers 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	the	market	.
 chin 	 a 	 	's	dalian	 commodit 	 y 	 	 ex 	 change 	 	,	three	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	2004	,	overtook	the	chicago	board	of	trade	to	 be 	 come 	 	the	second	largest	 commodit 	 y 	 	 ex 	 change 	 	in	the	world	.
now	,	in	ethiopia	,	we	're	in	the	process	of	 design 	 ing 	 	the	first	 organize 	 d 	 	ethiopia	 commodit 	 y 	 	 ex 	 change 	 	.
we	're	not	 try 	 ing 	 	to	cut	and	paste	the	chicago	model	or	the	india	model	,	but	creating	a	system	 un 	 ique 	 ly 	 	 tailor 	 ed 	 	to	ethiopia	's	 need 	 s 	 	and	 real 	 ities 	 	,	ethiopia	's	small	 farm 	 ers 	 	.
so	,	the	ecx	is	an	ethiopian	 ex 	 change 	 	for	ethiopia	.
we	're	creating	a	system	that	 serve 	 s 	 	all	market	 act 	 ors 	 	,
that	 create 	 s 	 	 integ 	 r 	 ity 	 	,	trust	,	efficiency	,	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	and	 en 	 able 	 s 	 	small	 farm 	 ers 	 	to	manage	the	 risk 	 s 	 	that	i	have	 de 	 scribed 	 	.
in	the	design	of	our	 commodit 	 y 	 	 ex 	 change 	 	in	ethiopia	,	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	 un 	 ique 	 	,	which	is	to	take	the	approach	of	an	 integrate 	 d 	 	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	or	what	we	call	the	ecx	edge	.
the	ecx	edge	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 create 	 s 	 	the	entire	 eco 	 system 	 	in	which	the	market	will	develop	 it 	 self 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	over	the	last	decade	of	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	market	 develop 	 ment 	 	in	africa	is	that	the	 piece 	 meal 	 	approach	 do 	 es 	 	not	work	.
you	've	got	one	donor	 try 	 ing 	 	to	develop	market	information	,	 an 	 other 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	work	on	or	sponsor	 grade 	 s 	 	and	 standard 	 s 	 	,	 an 	 other 	 	ict	,	and	yet	 an 	 other 	 	on	 ware 	 housing 	 	,	or	 ware 	 house 	 	 receipt 	 s 	 	.
in	our	approach	in	ethiopia	,	we	've	 decide 	 d 	 	to	put	together	the	entire	 eco 	 system 	 	,	or	environment	,	in	which	trade	 take 	 s 	 	place	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	the	 ex 	 change 	 	will	 oper 	 ate 	 	a	 tra 	 d 	 ing 	 	system	,	which	will	 initi 	 ally 	 	start	 a 	 s 	 	an	open	 out 	 cry 	 	,
 be 	 cause 	 	we	do	n't	think	the	country	's	ready	for	full	 electron 	 ic 	 	 tra 	 d 	 ing 	 	.
but	at	the	same	time	,	we	'll	do	 some 	 thing 	 	which	i	think	no	 ex 	 change 	 	in	the	world	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	 d 	 one 	 	,	which	is	 it 	 self 	 	to	 oper 	 ate 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	an	 inter 	 net 	 	cafe	in	the	 r 	 ural 	 	 area 	 s 	 	.
so	that	 farm 	 ers 	 	and	small	 trade 	 rs 	 	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	come	to	a	terminal	center	--	what	we	call	the	remote	access	terminal	 center 	 s 	 	--	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	buy	a	computer	or	figure	out	how	to	dial	up	or	any	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 simpl 	 y 	 	see	the	 tra 	 d 	 ing 	 	that	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	on	the	addis	ababa	 tra 	 d 	 ing 	 	floor	.
at	the	same	time	,	what	's	 ver 	 y 	 	fundamental	to	 th 	 is 	 	market	is	that	--	and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	an	 innov 	 ation 	 	that	we	've	designed	for	our	 ex 	 change 	 	--	is	that	the	 ex 	 change 	 	will	 oper 	 ate 	 	 ware 	 house 	 s 	 	around	the	country	,	in	which	grade	 cert 	 ification 	 	and	 ware 	 house 	 	receipting	will	be	 d 	 one 	 	.
and	in	turn	,	we	'll	 oper 	 ate 	 	an	in	-	house	 clear 	 ing 	 	system	,	to	assure	that	payment	is	 d 	 one 	 	 appropriate 	 ly 	 	,	in	the	right	amount	and	at	the	right	time	,	so	that	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	we	create	trust	and	 integ 	 r 	 ity 	 	in	the	system	.
 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	we	work	with	 ex 	 change 	 	 act 	 ors 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	we	're	 develop 	 ing 	 	the	 ex 	 change 	 	market	 it 	 self 	 	,	we	're	 al 	 so 	 	 develop 	 ing 	 	the	 regulat 	 ory 	 	 infra 	 structure 	 	and	legal	 frame 	 work 	 	,	the	overarching	legal	 frame 	 work 	 	for	making	 th 	 is 	 	market	work	.
so	,	in	fact	,	our	 pro 	 clam 	 ation 	 	is	going	to	parliament	next	month	.
what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	is	that	the	ecx	will	 oper 	 ate 	 	a	market	information	system	to	disseminate	 price 	 s 	 	in	real	time	to	 farm 	 ers 	 	around	the	country	,	using	vsat	technology	to	 br 	 ing 	 	an	 electron 	 ic 	 	price	 dis 	 semi 	 nation 	 
 direct 	 ly 	 	to	 farm 	 ers 	 	.	what	 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	is	 transform 	 s 	 	,	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	,	the	 farm 	 ers 	 	'	relationship	to	the	market	.
 where 	 a 	 s 	 	before	the	 farm 	 er 	 	used	to	think	local	--	meaning	that	he	or	she	would	go	to	the	 near 	 est 	 	local	market	,	eight	to	10	 kilometer 	 s 	 	away	on	average	,	and	sell	 what 	 ever 	 	they	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	have	,	 with 	 out 	 	any	idea	of	what	the	price	 pre 	 mium 	 	or	 any 	 thing 	 	else	was	--	now	 farm 	 ers 	 	come	with	knowledge	of	what	 price 	 s 	 	are	at	the	national	market	.
and	they	start	to	think	national	,	and	even	global	.
they	start	to	make	not	 on 	 ly 	 	commercial	 market 	 ing 	 	 decision 	 s 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 plant 	 ing 	 	 decision 	 s 	 	,	on	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	information	coming	from	the	 future 	 s 	 	price	market	.
and	they	come	to	the	market	 know 	 ing 	 	what	 grade 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 product 	 s 	 	will	 achiev 	 e 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	a	price	 pre 	 mium 	 	.
so	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	will	transform	 farm 	 ers 	 	.
it	will	 al 	 so 	 	transform	the	way	 trade 	 rs 	 	do	business	.
it	will	stop	them	from	 do 	 ing 	 	simple	,	back	-	to	-	back	,	 limit 	 ed 	 	 arbitr 	 age 	 	to	 re 	 ally 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	 strat 	 egic 	 ally 	 	about	how	to	move	grain	 a 	 cross 	 	long	 distance 	 s 	 	from	[	 sur 	 plus 	 	 region 	 s 	 	]	to	[	 defici 	 t 	 	 area 	 s 	 	]	.
can	ethiopia	do	 th 	 is 	 	?
it	 seem 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 ambit 	 ious 	 	.
but	it	will	create	new	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	.
we	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	 initi 	 ative 	 	 requir 	 es 	 	great	 politic 	 al 	 	will	,	and	we	'll	have	to	align	the	financial	sector	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	the	ict	sector	,	and	 re 	 ally 	 	even	the	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	legal	 frame 	 work 	 	.
we	 believ 	 e 	 	that	the	 wind 	 s 	 	of	change	are	here	,	and	that	we	can	do	it	.
ecx	is	the	market	for	ethiopia	's	new	 mill 	 e 	 nnium 	 	,	which	 start 	 s 	 	in	about	eight	 month 	 s 	 	.
the	last	parliament	of	our	century	 open 	 ed 	 	with	our	 p 	 resident 	 	 announc 	 ing 	 	to	the	country	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	economic	 initi 	 ative 	 	for	the	country	 to 	 day 	 	.
we	 believ 	 e 	 	that	the	 s 	 take 	 s 	 	are	high	,	but	that	the	 return 	 s 	 	will	be	even	 great 	 er 	 	.
ecx	,	 more 	 over 	 	,	can	 be 	 come 	 	a	 tra 	 d 	 ing 	 	platform	for	a	pan	-	african	market	in	 agricultur 	 al 	 	 commodit 	 ies 	 	.
ethiopia	's	domestic	market	is	about	one	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	of	value	.
and	we	feel	that	over	the	next	five	 year 	 s 	 	,	if	ethiopia	can	capture	even	40	percent	,	just	40	percent	,	of	the	domestic	market	,	and	add	just	25	percent	value	to	that	market	,	the	value	of	the	market	 double 	 s 	 	.
ethiopia	's	 agricultur 	 al 	 	market	is	30	percent	 high 	 er 	 	than	south	africa	's	grain	production	,	and	,	in	fact	,	ethiopia	is	the	second	largest	 ma 	 ize 	 	 produce 	 r 	 	in	africa	.
so	the	potential	is	there	.	the	will	is	there	.
the	 commit 	 ment 	 	is	there	.
so	we	feel	that	we	have	a	winning	value	 pro 	 position 	 	to	transform	 farm 	 ers 	 	'	 choice 	 s 	 	,	to	grow	our	 agricultur 	 e 	 	,	and	to	change	africa	.
so	,	we	are	in	the	business	of	 find 	 ing 	 	our	happiness	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
