the	problem	that	i	want	to	talk	with	you	about	is	 re 	 ally 	 	the	problem	of	:	how	 do 	 es 	 	one	supply	 health 	 care 	 	in	a	world	in	which	cost	is	 every 	 thing 	 	?
how	do	you	do	that	?
and	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	paradigm	we	want	to	suggest	to	you	,	i	want	to	suggest	to	you	,	is	treat	disease	you	have	to	first	know	what	you	're	 treat 	 ing 	 	--	that	's	 diagnos 	 tics 	 	--	and	then	you	have	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	.
so	,	the	program	that	we	're	 involve 	 d 	 	in	is	 some 	 thing 	 	which	we	call	 diagnos 	 tics 	 	for	all	,	or	zero	-	cost	 diagnos 	 tics 	 	.
how	do	you	provide	 medical 	 ly 	 	relevant	information	at	 a 	 s 	 	close	 a 	 s 	 	possible	to	zero	cost	?	how	do	you	do	it	?
let	me	just	give	you	two	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
the	 rigor 	 s 	 	of	 militar 	 y 	 	medicine	are	not	so	 dis 	 similar 	 	from	the	third	world	--	poor	 resource 	 s 	 	,	a	 rigor 	 ous 	 	environment	,	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 problem 	 s 	 	in	 light 	 weight 	 	,	and	 thing 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	kind	--
and	 al 	 so 	 	not	so	different	from	the	home	 health 	 care 	 	and	 diagnos 	 tic 	 	system	world	.
so	,	the	technology	that	i	want	to	talk	about	is	for	the	third	world	,	for	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	,	but	it	 ha 	 s 	 	,	i	think	,	much	 broad 	 er 	 	application	,	 be 	 cause 	 	information	is	so	 import 	 ant 	 	in	the	 health 	 care 	 	system	.
so	,	you	see	two	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	here	.
one	is	a	lab	that	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 fair 	 ly 	 	high	-	end	 labor 	 atory 	 	in	africa	.
the	second	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	an	entrepreneur	who	is	set	up	and	 do 	 ing 	 	who	-	 know 	 s 	 	-	what	in	a	table	in	a	market	.
i	do	n't	know	what	kind	of	 health 	 care 	 	is	 deliver 	 ed 	 	there	.
but	it	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	what	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	most	efficient	.
what	is	our	approach	?
and	the	way	in	which	one	 typical 	 ly 	 	 approach 	 es 	 	a	problem	of	 lower 	 ing 	 	cost	,	 start 	 ing 	 	from	the	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	is	to	take	our	solution	,	and	then	to	try	to	cut	cost	out	of	it	.
no	matter	how	you	do	that	,	you	're	not	going	to	start	with	a	100,000	-	dollar	instrument	and	 br 	 ing 	 	it	down	to	no	-	cost	.	it	is	n't	going	to	work	.
so	,	the	approach	that	we	took	was	the	other	way	around	.
to	ask	,	``	what	is	the	 cheap 	 est 	 	possible	stuff	that	you	could	make	a	 diagnos 	 tic 	 	system	out	of	,	and	get	 use 	 ful 	 	information	,	add	function	?	``	and	what	we	've	 chose 	 n 	 	is	paper	.
what	you	see	here	is	a	prototypic	 de 	 vice 	 	.
it	's	about	a	centimeter	on	the	side	.
it	's	about	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	 finger 	 nail 	 	.
the	lines	around	the	 edge 	 s 	 	are	a	polymer	.
it	's	made	of	paper	and	paper	,	of	course	,	 wick 	 s 	 	fluid	,
 a 	 s 	 	you	know	,	paper	,	cloth	--	drop	wine	on	the	 table 	 cloth 	 	,	and	the	wine	 wick 	 s 	 	all	over	 every 	 thing 	 	.
put	it	on	your	shirt	,	it	 ruin 	 s 	 	the	shirt	.
that	's	what	a	 hydro 	 philic 	 	surface	 do 	 es 	 	.
so	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	the	idea	is	that	you	drip	the	bottom	end	of	it	in	a	drop	of	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	 urin 	 e 	 	.
the	fluid	 wick 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	way	 in 	 to 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 chamber 	 s 	 	at	the	top	.
the	 brow 	 n 	 	color	 indic 	 ates 	 	the	amount	of	glucose	in	the	 urin 	 e 	 	,
the	blue	color	 indic 	 ates 	 	the	amount	of	protein	in	the	 urin 	 e 	 	.
and	the	combination	of	 t 	 hose 	 	two
is	a	first	order	shot	at	a	number	of	 use 	 ful 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	want	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	a	 de 	 vice 	 	made	from	a	simple	piece	of	paper	.
now	,	how	simple	can	you	make	the	production	?
why	do	we	 choos 	 e 	 	paper	?
there	's	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	the	same	thing	on	a	finger	,	 show 	 ing 	 	you	 bas 	 ically 	 	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
one	reason	for	using	paper	is	that	it	's	 every 	 where 	 	.
we	have	made	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	using	 napkin 	 s 	 	and	toilet	paper	and	 wrap 	 s 	 	,	and	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	stuff	.
so	,	the	production	 cap 	 ability 	 	is	there	.
the	second	is	,	you	can	put	 lot 	 s 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 test 	 s 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	place	.
i	'll	show	you	in	a	moment	that	the	stack	of	paper	there	would	 prob 	 ably 	 	hold	 some 	 thing 	 	like	100,000	 test 	 s 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	of	that	kind	.
and	then	 final 	 ly 	 	,	a	point	that	you	do	n't	think	of	so	much	in	 develop 	 ed 	 	world	medicine	:	it	 eliminate 	 s 	 	 sharp 	 s 	 	.
and	what	 sharp 	 s 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	is	 needle 	 s 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	that	stick	.
if	you	've	taken	a	 s 	 ample 	 	of	 some 	 one 	 	's	blood	and	the	 some 	 one 	 	might	have	 he 	 pat 	 itis 	 	c	,	you	do	n't	want	to	make	a	 mistak 	 e 	 	and	stick	it	in	you	.
it	just	--	you	do	n't	want	to	do	that	.
so	,	how	do	you	 dispos 	 e 	 	of	that	?	it	's	a	problem	 every 	 where 	 	.
and	here	you	 simpl 	 y 	 	burn	it	.
so	,	it	's	a	sort	of	a	practical	approach	to	 start 	 ing 	 	on	 thing 	 s 	 	.
now	,	you	say	,	``	if	paper	is	a	good	idea	,	other	people	have	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	thought	of	it	.	``
and	the	answer	is	,	of	course	,	 y 	 es 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	half	of	you	,	 rough 	 ly 	 	,	who	are	women	,	at	some	point	may	have	had	a	 pregn 	 ancy 	 	test	.
and	the	most	common	of	these	is	in	a	 de 	 vice 	 	that	 look 	 s 	 	like	the	thing	on	the	left	.
it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	a	lateral	flow	 immuno 	 assay 	 	.
in	that	 part 	 icular 	 	test	,	 urin 	 e 	 	either	,	 contain 	 ing 	 	a	hormone	 call 	 ed 	 	hcg	,	 do 	 es 	 	or	 do 	 es 	 	not	flow	 a 	 cross 	 	a	piece	of	paper	.
and	there	are	two	 bar 	 s 	 	.	one	bar	 indic 	 ates 	 	that	the	test	is	 work 	 ing 	 	,
and	if	the	second	bar	 show 	 s 	 	up	,	you	're	 pregn 	 ant 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 terr 	 ific 	 	kind	of	test	in	a	 bin 	 ary 	 	world	,
and	the	nice	thing	about	 pregn 	 ancy 	 	is	either	you	are	 pregn 	 ant 	 	or	you	're	not	 pregn 	 ant 	 	.
you	're	not	 partial 	 ly 	 	 pregn 	 ant 	 	or	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 be 	 ing 	 	 pregn 	 ant 	 	or	 some 	 thing 	 	of	that	sort	.
so	,	it	 work 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	well	there	,
but	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	 ver 	 y 	 	well	when	you	need	more	 quant 	 itative 	 	information	.
there	are	 al 	 so 	 	 dip 	 stick 	 s 	 	,
but	if	you	look	at	the	 dip 	 stick 	 s 	 	,	they	're	for	 an 	 other 	 	kind	of	 urin 	 e 	 	analysis	.
there	are	an	awful	lot	of	 color 	 s 	 	and	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	.
what	do	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	about	that	in	a	difficult	 circum 	 stance 	 	?
so	,	the	approach	that	we	 start 	 ed 	 	with	is	to	ask	:	is	it	 re 	 ally 	 	practical	to	make	 thing 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	sort	?
and	that	problem	is	now	,	in	a	 pur 	 e 	 ly 	 	 engineer 	 ing 	 	way	,	 solve 	 d 	 	.
and	the	procedure	that	we	have	is	 simpl 	 y 	 	to	start	with	paper	.
you	run	it	through	a	new	kind	of	 print 	 er 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	a	wax	 print 	 er 	 	.
the	wax	 print 	 er 	 	 do 	 es 	 	what	 look 	 s 	 	like	 print 	 ing 	 	.
it	is	 print 	 ing 	 	.	you	put	that	on	,	you	warm	it	a	little	bit	,
the	wax	 print 	 s 	 	through	so	it	 absorb 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	paper	,
and	you	end	up	with	the	 de 	 vice 	 	that	you	want	.
the	 print 	 ers 	 	cost	800	 buck 	 s 	 	now	.
they	'll	make	,	we	estimate	that	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	to	run	them	24	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	they	'd	make	about	10	million	 test 	 s 	 	a	year	.
so	,	it	's	a	 solve 	 d 	 	problem	,	that	 part 	 icular 	 	problem	is	 solve 	 d 	 	.
and	there	is	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	the	kind	of	thing	that	you	see	.
that	's	on	a	piece	of	8	by	12	paper	.
that	 take 	 s 	 	about	two	 second 	 s 	 	to	make	.
and	so	i	regard	that	 a 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	.
there	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	issue	here	,	which	is	that	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	a	 print 	 er 	 	,	a	color	 print 	 er 	 	,	it	 print 	 s 	 	 color 	 s 	 	.	that	's	what	color	 print 	 ers 	 	do	.
i	'll	show	you	in	a	moment	,	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	.
now	,	the	next	question	that	you	would	like	to	ask	is	:	what	would	you	like	to	measure	?	what	would	you	like	to	 analyz 	 e 	 	?
and	the	thing	which	you	'd	most	like	to	 analyz 	 e 	 	,	we	're	a	fair	distance	from	.
it	's	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 f 	 ever 	 	of	 un 	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	origin	.	``
 some 	 one 	 	 come 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	clinic	,	they	have	a	 f 	 ever 	 	,	they	feel	bad	.	what	do	they	have	?
do	they	have	t.b	.	?	do	they	have	 aid 	 s 	 	?
do	they	have	a	common	cold	?
the	 tri 	 age 	 	problem	.	that	's	a	hard	problem	for	 reason 	 s 	 	that	i	wo	n't	go	through	.
there	are	an	awful	lot	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	'd	like	to	distinguish	among	.
but	then	there	are	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	:	 aid 	 s 	 	,	 he 	 pat 	 itis 	 	,	malaria	,	tb	,	 other 	 s 	 
and	 simpl 	 er 	 	 one 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 gui 	 dance 	 	of	 treat 	 ment 	 	.
now	even	that	's	more	 complic 	 ated 	 	than	you	think	.
a	friend	of	mine	 work 	 s 	 	in	 trans 	 cultural 	 	 psych 	 iatry 	 	,
and	he	is	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	question	of	why	people	do	and	do	n't	take	 the 	 ir 	 	 med 	 s 	 	.
so	,	dapsone	,	or	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	,	you	have	to	take	it	for	a	while	.
he	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	story	of	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	a	 village 	 r 	 	in	india
and	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	have	you	taken	your	dapsone	?	``	``	 y 	 es 	 	.	``
``	have	you	taken	it	every	day	?	``	``	 y 	 es 	 	.	``	``	have	you	taken	if	for	a	month	?	``	``	 y 	 es 	 	.	``
what	the	guy	 actual 	 ly 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	was	that	he	'd	fed	a	30	-	day	dose	of	dapsone	to	his	dog	,	that	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
he	was	 tell 	 ing 	 	the	truth	.	 be 	 cause 	 	in	a	different	culture	,	the	dog	is	a	 sur 	 rog 	 ate 	 	for	you	,	you	know	,	``	 to 	 day 	 	,	``	``	 th 	 is 	 	month	,	``	``	since	the	 rain 	 y 	 	season	``	--	there	are	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	for	 mis 	 understand 	 ing 	 	,
and	so	an	issue	here	is	to	,	in	some	 case 	 s 	 	,	to	figure	out	how	to	deal	with	 matter 	 s 	 	that	seem	 un 	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	like	compliance	.
now	,	take	a	look	at	what	a	typical	test	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
prick	a	finger	,	you	get	some	blood	,	about	50	 micro 	 liter 	 s 	 	.
that	's	about	all	you	're	going	to	get	,
 be 	 cause 	 	you	ca	n't	use	the	usual	sort	of	 system 	 s 	 	.
you	ca	n't	 manipul 	 ate 	 	it	 ver 	 y 	 	well	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	i	'll	show	 some 	 thing 	 	about	that	in	a	moment	.
so	,	you	take	the	drop	of	blood	,	no	further	 manipul 	 ations 	 	,
you	put	it	on	a	little	 de 	 vice 	 	,
the	 de 	 vice 	 	 filter 	 s 	 	out	the	blood	 cell 	 s 	 	,	lets	the	 s 	 er 	 um 	 	go	through	,	and	you	get	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 color 	 s 	 	down	in	the	bottom	there	.
and	the	 color 	 s 	 	 indic 	 ate 	 	``	disease	``	or	``	normal	.	``
but	even	that	's	 complic 	 ated 	 	,
 be 	 cause 	 	to	you	,	to	me	,	 color 	 s 	 	might	 indic 	 ate 	 	``	normal	,	``
but	,	after	all	,	we	're	all	 suffer 	 ing 	 	from	 prob 	 ably 	 	an	excess	of	education	.
what	you	do	about	 some 	 thing 	 	which	 requir 	 es 	 	 quant 	 itative 	 	analysis	?
and	so	the	solution	that	we	and	 man 	 y 	 	other	people	are	 think 	 ing 	 	about	there	,	and	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	there	is	a	 dramat 	 ic 	 	flourish	,	and	out	 come 	 s 	 	the	universal	solution	to	 every 	 thing 	 	these	 day 	 s 	 	,	which	is	a	cell	phone	.	in	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	case	,	a	camera	phone	.
they	're	 every 	 where 	 	,	six	billion	a	month	in	india	.
and	the	idea	is	that	what	one	 do 	 es 	 	,	is	to	take	the	 de 	 vice 	 	,
you	dip	it	,	you	develop	the	color	,
you	take	a	picture	,	the	picture	 go 	 es 	 	to	a	central	 labor 	 atory 	 	.
you	do	n't	have	to	 s 	 end 	 	out	a	doctor	,
you	 s 	 end 	 	out	 some 	 body 	 	who	can	just	take	the	 s 	 ample 	 	,
and	in	the	clinic	either	a	doctor	,	or	 ideal 	 ly 	 	a	computer	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	 do 	 es 	 	the	analysis	.
 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	work	 actual 	 ly 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	well	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	when	your	color	 print 	 er 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 print 	 ed 	 	the	color	 bar 	 s 	 	that	 indic 	 ate 	 	how	 thing 	 s 	 	work	.
so	,	my	view	of	the	health	care	 work 	 er 	 	of	the	future	is	not	a	doctor	,	but	is	an	18	-	year	-	old	,	 other 	 wise 	 	 un 	 employ 	 ed 	 	,	who	 ha 	 s 	 	two	 thing 	 s 	 	:	he	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 back 	 pack 	 	full	of	these	 test 	 s 	 	,
and	a	 lance 	 t 	 	to	 occasion 	 ally 	 	take	a	blood	 s 	 ample 	 	,	and	an	ak	-	47	.
and	these	are	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	get	him	through	his	day	.
there	's	 an 	 other 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 connect 	 ion 	 	here	,
and	that	is	that	what	one	 want 	 s 	 	to	do	is	to	pass	through	 use 	 ful 	 	information	over	what	is	 general 	 ly 	 	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	awful	 tele 	 phone 	 	system	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	there	's	an	enormous	amount	of	information	 al 	 ready 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	on	that	subject	,	which	is	the	mars	 r 	 over 	 	problem	.
how	do	you	get	back	an	accurate	view	of	the	color	on	mars	if	you	have	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 terr 	 ible 	 	 band 	 width 	 	to	do	it	with	?
and	the	answer	is	not	 complic 	 ated 	 	but	it	's	one	which	i	do	n't	want	to	go	through	here	,	other	than	to	say	that	the	communication	 system 	 s 	 	for	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	well	 under 	 stood 	 	.
 al 	 so 	 	,	a	fact	which	you	may	not	know	is	that	the	compute	 cap 	 ability 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	thing	is	not	so	different	from	the	compute	 cap 	 ability 	 	of	your	 desk 	 top 	 	computer	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	fantastic	 de 	 vice 	 	which	is	 on 	 ly 	 	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	be	 ta 	 pped 	 	.
i	do	n't	know	 whet 	 her 	 	the	idea	of	one	computer	,	one	child	 make 	 s 	 	any	sense	.	here	's	the	computer	of	the	future	,
 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	screen	is	 al 	 ready 	 	there	and	they	're	 ubiqu 	 it 	 ous 	 	.
all	right	now	let	me	show	you	just	a	little	bit	about	 advance 	 d 	 	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	.
and	we	'll	start	by	posing	a	little	problem	.
what	you	see	here	is	 an 	 other 	 	centimeter	-	sized	 de 	 vice 	 	,
and	the	different	 color 	 s 	 	are	different	 color 	 s 	 	of	dye	.
and	you	notice	 some 	 thing 	 	which	might	strike	you	 a 	 s 	 	a	little	bit	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	which	is	the	yellow	 seem 	 s 	 	to	disappear	,	get	through	the	blue	,	and	then	get	through	the	red	.
how	 do 	 es 	 	that	happen	?	how	do	you	make	 some 	 thing 	 	flow	through	 some 	 thing 	 	?
and	,	of	course	the	answer	is	,	``	you	do	n't	.	``
you	make	it	flow	under	and	over	.
but	now	the	question	is	:	how	do	you	make	it	flow	under	and	over	in	a	piece	of	paper	?
the	answer	is	that	what	you	do	,	and	the	 detail 	 s 	 	are	not	 terr 	 ibly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	here	,	is	to	make	 some 	 thing 	 	more	elaborate	:	you	take	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	different	 layer 	 s 	 	of	paper	,	each	one	 contain 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	own	little	fluid	system	,	and	you	 separat 	 e 	 	them	by	 piece 	 s 	 	of	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	double	-	sided	carpet	tape	,	the	stuff	you	use	to	stick	the	 carpet 	 s 	 	onto	the	floor	.
and	the	fluid	will	flow	from	one	layer	 in 	 to 	 	the	next	.
it	 distribut 	 es 	 	 it 	 self 	 	,	 flow 	 s 	 	through	further	 hole 	 s 	 	,	 distribut 	 es 	 	 it 	 self 	 	.
and	what	you	see	,	at	the	lower	right	-	hand	side	there	,	is	a	 s 	 ample 	 	in	which	a	single	 s 	 ample 	 	of	blood	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	put	on	the	top	,	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	through	and	 distribut 	 ed 	 	 it 	 self 	 	 in 	 to 	 	these	16	 hole 	 s 	 	on	the	bottom	,	in	a	piece	of	paper	--	 bas 	 ically 	 	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	chip	,	two	 piece 	 s 	 	of	paper	thick	.
and	in	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	case	we	 we 	 re 	 	just	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	 re 	 plic 	 ability 	 	of	that	.
but	that	is	,	in	principle	,	the	way	you	solve	the	``	 f 	 ever 	 	of	 un 	 explain 	 ed 	 	origin	``	problem	,
 be 	 cause 	 	each	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 spot 	 s 	 	then	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	test	for	a	 part 	 icular 	 	set	of	 marker 	 s 	 	of	disease	,
and	 th 	 is 	 	will	work	in	due	course	.
here	is	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	a	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	more	 complic 	 ated 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	.
there	's	the	chip	.
you	dip	in	a	corner	.	the	fluid	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	center	.
it	 distribut 	 es 	 	 it 	 self 	 	out	 in 	 to 	 	these	 vari 	 ous 	 	 well 	 s 	 	or	 hole 	 s 	 	,	and	 turn 	 s 	 	color	,
and	all	 d 	 one 	 	with	paper	and	carpet	tape	.
so	,	i	think	it	's	 a 	 s 	 	low	-	cost	 a 	 s 	 	we	're	 like 	 ly 	 	to	be	able	to	come	up	and	make	 thing 	 s 	 	.
now	,	i	have	one	last	,	two	last	little	 st 	 ories 	 	to	tell	you	,	in	 finish 	 ing 	 	off	 th 	 is 	 	business	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	:	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	one	 do 	 es 	 	 occasion 	 ally 	 	need	to	do	is	to	 separat 	 e 	 	blood	 cell 	 s 	 	from	 s 	 er 	 um 	 	.
and	the	question	was	,	here	we	do	it	by	taking	a	 s 	 ample 	 	,
we	put	it	in	a	 cent 	 rifuge 	 	,
we	spin	it	,	and	you	get	blood	 cell 	 s 	 	out	.	 terr 	 ific 	 	.
what	 happen 	 s 	 	if	you	do	n't	have	an	 electric 	 ity 	 	,	and	a	 cent 	 rifuge 	 	,	and	 what 	 ever 	 	?
and	we	thought	for	a	while	of	how	you	might	do	 th 	 is 	 
and	the	way	,	in	fact	,	you	do	it	is	what	's	 show 	 n 	 	here	.
you	get	an	eggbeater	,	which	is	 every 	 where 	 	,	and	you	saw	off	a	blade	,
and	then	you	take	 tub 	 ing 	 	,	and	you	stick	it	on	that	.	you	put	the	blood	in	,	you	spin	it	--
 some 	 body 	 	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	there	and	 spin 	 s 	 	it	.
it	 work 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	well	.
and	we	 s 	 at 	 	down	,	we	did	the	physics	of	 eggbeater 	 s 	 	and	self	-	 align 	 ing 	 	 tube 	 s 	 	and	all	the	rest	of	that	kind	of	thing	,	 s 	 ent 	 	it	off	to	a	journal	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	proud	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	the	title	,	which	was	``	eggbeater	 a 	 s 	 	 cent 	 rifuge 	 	.	``
and	we	 s 	 ent 	 	it	off	,	and	by	return	mail	it	came	back	.
i	 call 	 ed 	 	up	the	editor	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	's	going	on	?	how	is	 th 	 is 	 	possible	?	``
the	editor	 s 	 aid 	 	,	with	enormous	disdain	,	``	i	read	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	we	're	not	going	to	publish	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 on 	 ly 	 	publish	science	.	``
and	it	's	an	 import 	 ant 	 	issue	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	we	have	to	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	think	about	what	we	value	.
and	if	it	's	just	 paper 	 s 	 	and	 phy 	 s 	 	.	rev	.	 letter 	 s 	 	,	we	've	got	a	problem	.
here	is	 an 	 other 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 some 	 thing 	 	which	is	--
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	little	 spectro 	 photo 	 meter 	 	.
it	 measure 	 s 	 	the	absorption	of	light	in	a	 s 	 ample 	 
the	neat	thing	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	you	have	light	source	that	 flick 	 ers 	 	on	and	off	at	about	1,000	hertz	,
 an 	 other 	 	light	source	that	 detect 	 s 	 	that	light	at	1,000	hertz	,
and	so	you	can	run	 th 	 is 	 	system	in	broad	 day 	 light 	 	.
it	 perform 	 s 	 	about	 equi 	 valent 	 ly 	 	to	a	system	that	's	in	the	order	of	100,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	.	it	 cost 	 s 	 	50	 dollar 	 s 	 	.	we	can	 prob 	 ably 	 	make	it	for	50	 cent 	 s 	 	,	if	we	put	our	mind	to	it	.
why	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 some 	 body 	 	do	it	?	and	the	answer	is	,	``	how	do	you	make	a	profit	in	a	 capital 	 ist 	 	system	,	 do 	 ing 	 	that	?	``
 interest 	 ing 	 	problem	.
so	,	let	me	finish	by	 say 	 ing 	 	that	we	've	thought	about	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	 engineer 	 ing 	 	problem	.
and	we	've	 ask 	 ed 	 	:	what	is	the	scientific	 un 	 ifying 	 	idea	here	?
and	we	've	 decide 	 d 	 	that	we	should	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	not	so	much	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	cost	,	but	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 simpl 	 icity 	 	.
 simpl 	 icity 	 	is	a	neat	word	.	and	you	've	got	to	think	about	what	 simpl 	 icity 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	.
i	know	what	it	is	but	i	do	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	know	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	.
so	,	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	was	 interest 	 ed 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	to	put	together	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 group 	 s 	 	of	people	.
and	the	most	 re 	 cent 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	a	couple	of	people	at	mit	,	one	of	them	 be 	 ing 	 	an	 exception 	 ally 	 	bright	kid	who	is	one	of	the	 ver 	 y 	 	few	people	i	would	think	of	who	's	an	authentic	 gen 	 ius 	 	.
we	all	 struggle 	 d 	 	for	an	entire	day	to	think	about	 simpl 	 icity 	 	.
and	i	want	to	give	you	the	answer	of	 th 	 is 	 	deep	scientific	thought	.
so	,	in	a	sense	,	you	get	what	you	pay	for	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
