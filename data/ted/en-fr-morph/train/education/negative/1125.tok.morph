my	 student 	 s 	 	often	ask	me	,	``	what	is	 socio 	 logy 	 	?	``
and	i	tell	them	,	``	it	's	the	 stud 	 y 	 	of	the	way	in	which	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	are	shaped	by	 thing 	 s 	 	that	they	do	n't	see	.	``	and	they	say	,	``	so	how	can	i	be	a	 socio 	 logist 	 	?
how	can	i	understand	 t 	 hose 	 	 in 	 visible 	 	 force 	 s 	 	?	``
and	i	say	,	``	 empath 	 y 	 	.
start	with	 empath 	 y 	 	.
it	all	 begin 	 s 	 	with	 empath 	 y 	 	.
take	 your 	 self 	 	out	of	your	 shoe 	 s 	 	,	put	 your 	 self 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 shoe 	 s 	 	of	 an 	 other 	 	person	.	``	here	,	i	'll	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
so	i	imagine	my	life	:	if	a	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	ago	 chin 	 a 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	the	most	 power 	 ful 	 	nation	in	the	world	and	they	came	to	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	in	search	of	coal	,	and	they	found	it	,	and	,	in	fact	,	they	found	 lot 	 s 	 	of	it	right	here	.
and	 pre 	 tty 	 	soon	,	they	 beg 	 an 	 	 ship 	 ping 	 	that	coal	,	ton	by	ton	,	rail	car	by	rail	car	,	 boat 	 load 	 	by	 boat 	 load 	 	,	back	to	 chin 	 a 	 	and	 else 	 where 	 	around	the	world	.
and	they	got	 fabulous 	 ly 	 	 wealth 	 y 	 	in	 do 	 ing 	 	so	.
and	they	built	 beaut 	 iful 	 	cities	all	powered	on	that	coal	.
and	back	here	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	we	saw	economic	despair	,	 depriv 	 ation 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	saw	.
i	saw	people	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	to	get	by	,	not	 know 	 ing 	 	what	was	what	and	what	was	next	.
and	then	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	 my 	 self 	 	the	question	.
i	say	,	``	how	's	it	possible	that	we	could	be	so	poor	here	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	coal	is	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 wealth 	 y 	 	resource	,	it	's	so	much	money	?	``	and	i	 real 	 ized 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	chinese	 ing 	 rati 	 ated 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	with	a	small	 rul 	 ing 	 	class	here	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	who	stole	all	of	that	money	and	all	of	that	wealth	for	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
and	the	rest	of	us	,	the	vast	 major 	 ity 	 	of	us	,	struggle	to	get	by	.
and	the	chinese	 g 	 ave 	 	 th 	 is 	 	small	 rul 	 ing 	 	elite	 load 	 s 	 	of	 militar 	 y 	 	 weapon 	 s 	 	and	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	technology	in	order	to	ensure	that	people	like	me	would	not	speak	out	against	 th 	 is 	 	relationship	.
 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	sound	familiar	?
and	they	did	 thing 	 s 	 	like	train	americans	to	help	protect	the	coal	.
and	 every 	 where 	 	,	 we 	 re 	 	 symbol 	 s 	 	of	the	chinese	--	 every 	 where 	 	,	a	constant	 re 	 mind 	 er 	 	.
and	back	in	 chin 	 a 	 	,	what	do	they	say	in	 chin 	 a 	 	?
 noth 	 ing 	 	.	they	do	n't	talk	about	us	.	they	do	n't	talk	about	the	coal	.
if	you	ask	them	,	they	'll	say	,	``	well	,	you	know	the	coal	,	we	need	the	coal	.
i	mean	,	come	on	,	i	'm	not	going	to	turn	down	my	 thermo 	 stat 	 	.
you	ca	n't	expect	that	.	``	and	so	i	get	 ang 	 ry 	 	,	and	i	get	 piss 	 ed 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	do	 lot 	 s 	 	of	average	people	.
and	we	fight	back	,	and	it	 get 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 ug 	 ly 	 	.
and	the	chinese	respond	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 ug 	 ly 	 	way	.
and	before	we	know	it	,	they	 s 	 end 	 	in	the	 tank 	 s 	 	and	then	 s 	 end 	 	in	the	 troop 	 s 	 	,	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	people	are	 dy 	 ing 	 	,	and	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
can	you	imagine	what	you	would	feel	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	in	my	 shoe 	 s 	 	?
can	you	imagine	 walk 	 ing 	 	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	building	and	 see 	 ing 	 	a	tank	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	out	there	or	a	truck	full	of	 soldier 	 s 	 	?
and	just	imagine	what	you	would	feel	.
 be 	 cause 	 	you	know	why	they	're	here	,	and	you	know	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	here	.
and	you	just	feel	the	anger	and	you	feel	the	fear	.
if	you	can	,	that	's	 empath 	 y 	 	--	that	's	 empath 	 y 	 	.
you	've	left	your	 shoe 	 s 	 	,	and	you	've	stood	in	mine	.
and	you	've	got	to	feel	that	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	that	's	the	warm	up	.
that	's	the	warm	up	.
now	we	're	going	to	have	the	real	radical	experiment	.
and	so	for	the	 remain 	 der 	 	of	my	talk	,	what	i	want	you	to	do	is	put	 your 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	the	 shoe 	 s 	 	of	an	 ordin 	 ary 	 	arab	muslim	living	in	the	middle	east	--	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	in	 ir 	 aq 	 	.
and	so	to	help	you	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	you	're	a	member	of	 th 	 is 	 	middle	class	family	in	baghdad	--	and	what	you	want	is	the	best	for	your	 kid 	 s 	 	.
you	want	your	 kid 	 s 	 	to	have	a	better	life	.
and	you	watch	the	news	,	you	pay	attention	,	you	read	the	 news 	 paper 	 	,	you	go	down	to	the	coffee	shop	with	your	 friend 	 s 	 	,	and	you	read	the	 news 	 paper 	 s 	 	from	around	the	world	.
and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	you	even	watch	satellite	,	cnn	,	from	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
so	you	have	a	sense	of	what	the	americans	are	 think 	 ing 	 	.
but	 re 	 ally 	 	,	you	just	want	a	better	life	for	 your 	 self 	 	.
that	's	what	you	want	.
you	're	arab	muslim	living	in	 ir 	 aq 	 	.
you	want	a	better	life	for	 your 	 self 	 	.
so	here	,	let	me	help	you	.
let	me	help	you	with	some	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	might	be	 think 	 ing 	 	.
number	one	:	 th 	 is 	 	 incur 	 s 	 ion 	 	 in 	 to 	 	your	land	these	past	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	before	,	the	reason	 any 	 one 	 	is	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	your	land	,	and	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	it	's	oil	.
it	's	all	about	oil	;	you	know	that	,	 every 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	that	.
people	here	back	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	know	it	's	about	oil	.
it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	 some 	 body 	 	else	 ha 	 s 	 	a	design	for	your	resource	.
it	's	your	resource	;	it	's	not	 some 	 body 	 	else	's	.
it	's	your	land	;	it	's	your	resource	.
 some 	 body 	 	else	 ha 	 s 	 	a	design	for	it	.
and	you	know	why	they	have	a	design	?
you	know	why	they	have	 the 	 ir 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	set	on	it	?
 be 	 cause 	 	they	have	an	entire	economic	system	that	's	dependent	on	that	oil	--	foreign	oil	,	oil	from	other	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	world	that	they	do	n't	own	.
and	what	else	do	you	think	about	these	people	?
the	americans	,	they	're	rich	.
come	on	,	they	live	in	big	 house 	 s 	 	,	they	have	big	 car 	 s 	 	,	they	all	have	blond	hair	,	blue	 eye 	 s 	 	,	they	're	happy	.
you	think	that	.	it	's	not	true	,	of	course	,	but	that	's	the	media	impression	,	and	that	's	like	what	you	get	.
and	they	have	big	cities	,	and	the	cities	are	all	dependent	on	oil	.
and	back	home	,	what	do	you	see	?
poverty	,	despair	,	struggle	.
look	,	you	do	n't	live	in	a	 wealth 	 y 	 	country	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 ir 	 aq 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	you	see	.
you	see	people	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	to	get	by	.
i	mean	,	it	's	not	easy	;	you	see	a	lot	of	poverty	.
and	you	feel	 some 	 thing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
these	people	have	 design 	 s 	 	for	your	resource	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	you	see	?
 some 	 thing 	 	else	you	see	that	you	talk	about	--	americans	do	n't	talk	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	you	do	.
there	's	 th 	 is 	 	thing	,	 th 	 is 	 	 militar 	 ization 	 	of	the	world	,	and	it	's	 center 	 ed 	 	right	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
and	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	is	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	 al 	 most 	 	one	half	of	the	world	's	 militar 	 y 	 	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	--	four	percent	of	the	world	's	population	.
and	you	feel	it	;	you	see	it	every	day	.
it	's	part	of	your	life	.
and	you	talk	about	it	with	your	 friend 	 s 	 	.
you	read	about	it	.
and	back	when	saddam	hussein	was	in	power	,	the	americans	did	n't	care	about	his	 crime 	 s 	 	.
when	he	was	 gas 	 s 	 ing 	 	the	kurds	and	 gas 	 s 	 ing 	 	iran	,	they	did	n't	care	about	it	.
when	oil	was	at	 s 	 take 	 	,	 some 	 how 	 	,	 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	 matter 	 ed 	 	.
and	what	you	see	,	 some 	 thing 	 	else	,	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	the	hub	of	 demo 	 cracy 	 	around	the	world	,	they	do	n't	seem	to	 re 	 ally 	 	be	 support 	 ing 	 	 democrat 	 ic 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	all	around	the	world	.
there	are	a	lot	of	 count 	 ries 	 	,	oil	-	producing	 count 	 ries 	 	,	that	are	n't	 ver 	 y 	 	 democrat 	 ic 	 	,	but	 support 	 ed 	 	by	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
that	's	odd	.
oh	,	these	 incur 	 s 	 ions 	 	,	these	two	 war 	 s 	 	,	the	10	 year 	 s 	 	of	 sanct 	 ions 	 	,	the	eight	 year 	 s 	 	of	occupation	,	the	insurgency	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	 unleash 	 ed 	 	on	your	people	,	the	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	,	the	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 civil 	 ian 	 	 death 	 s 	 	,	all	 be 	 cause 	 	of	oil	.
you	ca	n't	help	but	think	that	.
you	talk	about	it	.
it	's	in	the	 fore 	 front 	 	of	your	mind	 al 	 ways 	 	.
you	say	,	``	how	is	that	possible	?	``
and	 th 	 is 	 	man	,	he	's	every	man	--	your	 grand 	 father 	 	,	your	uncle	,	your	father	,	your	son	,	your	neighbor	,	your	professor	,	your	student	.
once	a	life	of	happiness	and	joy	and	 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	pain	and	sorrow	.
 every 	 one 	 	in	your	country	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 touch 	 ed 	 	by	the	violence	,	the	 blood 	 shed 	 	,	the	pain	,	the	 horr 	 or 	 	,	 every 	 body 	 	.
not	a	single	person	in	your	country	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 be 	 en 	 	 touch 	 ed 	 	.
but	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	else	about	these	people	,	these	americans	who	are	there	.
there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	else	about	them	that	you	see	--	they	do	n't	see	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
and	what	do	you	see	?	they	're	christians	.
they	're	christians	.
they	worship	the	christian	god	,	they	have	 cross 	 es 	 	,	they	carry	 b 	 ible 	 s 	 	.
 the 	 ir 	 	 b 	 ible 	 s 	 	have	a	little	insignia	that	 say 	 s 	 	``	u.s.	 arm 	 y 	 	``	on	them	.
and	 the 	 ir 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	:	before	they	 s 	 end 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 son 	 s 	 	and	 daughter 	 s 	 	off	to	war	in	your	country	--	and	you	know	the	reason	--	before	they	 s 	 end 	 	them	off	,	they	go	to	a	christian	church	,	and	they	pray	to	 the 	 ir 	 	christian	god	,	and	they	ask	for	 protect 	 ion 	 	and	 gui 	 dance 	 	from	that	god	.
why	?
well	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	when	people	die	in	the	war	,	they	are	muslims	,	they	are	iraqis	--	they	're	not	americans	.
you	do	n't	want	americans	to	die	.	protect	our	 troop 	 s 	 	.
and	you	feel	 some 	 thing 	 	about	that	--	of	course	you	do	.
and	they	do	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
you	read	about	it	,	you	hear	about	it	.
they	're	there	to	build	 school 	 s 	 	and	help	people	,	and	that	's	what	they	want	to	do	.
they	do	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	but	they	 al 	 so 	 	do	the	bad	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	you	ca	n't	tell	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	guy	,	you	get	a	guy	like	lt.	gen.	william	boykin	.
i	mean	,	here	's	a	guy	who	 say 	 s 	 	that	your	god	is	a	false	god	.
your	god	's	an	idol	;	his	god	is	the	true	god	.
the	solution	to	the	problem	in	the	middle	east	,	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	him	,	is	to	convert	you	all	to	christianity	--	just	get	rid	of	your	 relig 	 ion 	 	.
and	you	know	that	.	americans	do	n't	read	about	 th 	 is 	 	guy	.
they	do	n't	know	 any 	 thing 	 	about	him	,	but	you	do	.
you	pass	it	around	.	you	pass	his	 word 	 s 	 	around	.
i	mean	 th 	 is 	 	is	serious	.	you	're	 af 	 raid 	 	.
he	was	one	of	the	 lead 	 ing 	 	 command 	 ers 	 	in	the	second	invasion	of	 ir 	 aq 	 	.
and	you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	god	,	if	 th 	 is 	 	guy	is	 say 	 ing 	 	that	,	then	all	the	 soldier 	 s 	 	must	be	 say 	 ing 	 	that	.	``	and	 th 	 is 	 	word	here	,	george	bush	 call 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	war	a	crusade	.
man	,	the	americans	,	they	're	just	like	,	``	ah	,	crusade	.
 what 	 ever 	 	.	i	do	n't	know	.	``	you	know	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	holy	war	against	muslims	.
look	,	 invad 	 e 	 	,	 sub 	 due 	 	them	,	take	 the 	 ir 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	.
if	they	wo	n't	submit	,	kill	them	.
that	's	what	 th 	 is 	 	is	about	.
and	you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	my	god	,	these	christians	are	coming	to	kill	us	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	 frighten 	 ing 	 	.
you	feel	 frighten 	 ed 	 	.	of	course	you	feel	 frighten 	 ed 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	man	,	terry	jones	:	i	mean	here	's	a	guy	who	 want 	 s 	 	to	burn	korans	,	right	?
and	the	americans	:	``	ah	,	he	's	a	 knuckle 	 head 	 	.
he	's	a	 form 	 er 	 	hotel	 manage 	 r 	 	;	he	's	got	three	-	dozen	 member 	 s 	 	of	his	church	.	``	they	laugh	him	off	.	you	do	n't	laugh	him	off	.
 be 	 cause 	 	in	the	 con 	 text 	 	of	 every 	 thing 	 	else	,	all	the	 piece 	 s 	 	fit	.
i	mean	,	of	course	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	americans	take	it	,	so	people	all	over	the	middle	east	,	not	just	in	your	country	,	are	 protest 	 ing 	 	.
``	he	 want 	 s 	 	to	burn	korans	,	our	holy	book	.
these	christians	,	who	are	these	christians	?
they	're	so	 e 	 vil 	 	,	they	're	so	mean	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	they	're	about	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	arab	muslim	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	iraqi	.
of	course	you	're	going	to	think	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	then	your	cousin	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	 cu 	 z 	 	,	check	out	 th 	 is 	 	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
you	've	got	to	see	 th 	 is 	 	--	 b 	 ible 	 	boot	camp	.
these	christians	are	nuts	.
they	're	training	 the 	 ir 	 	little	 kid 	 s 	 	to	be	 soldier 	 s 	 	for	jesus	.
and	they	take	these	little	 kid 	 s 	 	and	they	run	them	through	these	 thing 	 s 	 	till	they	teach	them	how	to	say	,	``	 s 	 ir 	 	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	 s 	 ir 	 	,	``	and	 thing 	 s 	 	like	grenade	 to 	 s 	 s 	 	and	 weapon 	 s 	 	care	and	maintenance	.
and	go	to	the	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
it	 say 	 s 	 	``	u.s.	 arm 	 y 	 	``	right	on	it	.
i	mean	,	these	christians	,	they	're	nuts	.	how	would	they	do	 th 	 is 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	little	 kid 	 s 	 	?	``	and	you	're	 read 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
and	of	course	,	christians	back	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	or	 any 	 body 	 	,	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	ah	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	some	little	,	 tin 	 y 	 	church	in	the	middle	of	 no 	 where 	 	.	``
you	do	n't	know	that	.
for	you	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	like	all	christians	.
it	's	all	over	the	web	,	 b 	 ible 	 	boot	camp	.
and	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	:	they	even	teach	 the 	 ir 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	--	they	train	them	in	the	same	way	the	u.s.	marines	train	.
is	n't	that	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
and	it	 s 	 care 	 s 	 	you	,	and	it	 frighten 	 s 	 	you	.
so	these	 guy 	 s 	 	,	you	see	them	.
you	see	,	i	,	sam	richards	,	i	know	who	these	 guy 	 s 	 	are	.
they	're	my	 student 	 s 	 	,	my	 friend 	 s 	 	.
i	know	what	they	're	 think 	 ing 	 	:	``	you	do	n't	know	.	``
when	you	see	them	,	they	're	 some 	 thing 	 	else	,	they	're	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
that	's	what	they	are	to	you	.
we	do	n't	see	it	that	way	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	but	you	see	it	that	way	.
so	here	.
of	course	,	you	got	it	wrong	.
you	're	 general 	 izing 	 	.	it	's	wrong	.
you	do	n't	understand	the	americans	.
it	's	not	a	christian	invasion	.
we	're	not	just	there	for	oil	;	we	're	there	for	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 reason 	 s 	 	.
you	have	it	wrong	.	you	've	 mis 	 s 	 ed 	 	it	.
and	of	course	,	most	of	you	do	n't	support	the	insurgency	;	you	do	n't	support	 kill 	 ing 	 	americans	;	you	do	n't	support	the	 terrorist 	 s 	 	.
of	course	you	do	n't	.	 ver 	 y 	 	few	people	do	.
but	some	of	you	do	.

it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 understand 	 ing 	 	.
now	,	you	might	ask	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	sam	,	so	why	do	you	do	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	thing	?
why	would	you	use	 th 	 is 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	all	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	?	``

you	're	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	hate	these	people	.
you	're	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	just	hate	them	with	every	fiber	of	your	 be 	 ing 	 	.
and	if	i	can	get	you	to	step	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 shoe 	 s 	 	and	walk	an	inch	,	one	 tin 	 y 	 	inch	,	then	imagine	the	kind	of	 socio 	 logical 	 	analysis	that	you	can	do	in	all	other	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	of	your	life	.
you	can	walk	a	mile	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	 understand 	 ing 	 	why	that	person	's	 driv 	 ing 	 	40	 mile 	 s 	 	per	hour	in	the	 pass 	 ing 	 	lane	,	or	your	 teen 	 age 	 	son	,	or	your	neighbor	who	 annoy 	 s 	 	you	by	cutting	his	lawn	on	sunday	 morn 	 ing 	 s 	 	.

and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	tell	my	 student 	 s 	 	:	step	 out 	 side 	 	of	your	 tin 	 y 	 	,	little	world	.
step	 in 	 side 	 	of	the	 tin 	 y 	 	,	little	world	of	 some 	 body 	 	else	.
and	then	do	it	 aga 	 in 	 	and	do	it	 aga 	 in 	 	and	do	it	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	 sudden 	 ly 	 	all	these	 tin 	 y 	 	,	little	 world 	 s 	 	,	they	come	together	in	 th 	 is 	 	complex	web	.
and	they	build	a	big	,	complex	world	.
and	 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	 real 	 izing 	 	it	,	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	the	world	 different 	 ly 	 	.
 every 	 thing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	.
 every 	 thing 	 	in	your	life	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	.
and	that	's	,	of	course	,	what	 th 	 is 	 	is	about	.
attend	to	other	 live 	 s 	 	,	other	 vision 	 s 	 	.
listen	to	other	people	,	enlighten	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
i	'm	not	 say 	 ing 	 	that	i	support	the	 terrorist 	 s 	 	in	 ir 	 aq 	 	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	a	 socio 	 logist 	 	,	what	i	am	 say 	 ing 	 	is	i	understand	.
and	now	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	--	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	--	you	do	too	.
thank	you	.
