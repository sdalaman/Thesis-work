i	'd	like	to	speak	about	technology	 trend 	 s 	 	,	which	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	follow	--	but	we	 al 	 so 	 	follow	,	for	related	 reason 	 s 	 	.
 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	 be 	 ing 	 	a	technology	magazine	,	technology	 trend 	 s 	 	are	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	write	about	and	need	to	know	about	.
but	 al 	 so 	 	it	's	part	of	 be 	 ing 	 	any	 month 	 ly 	 	magazine	--	you	live	in	the	future	.	and	we	have	a	long	lead	-	time	.
we	have	to	plan	 issue 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 month 	 s 	 	in	advance	;	we	have	to	guess	at	what	public	 appetit 	 es 	 	are	going	to	be	six	 month 	 s 	 	,	nine	 month 	 s 	 	down	the	road	.	so	we	're	in	the	 fore 	 cast 	 ing 	 	business	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	,	like	a	lot	of	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	,	create	a	product
that	's	based	on	technology	 trend 	 s 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	 our 	 s 	 	is	about	 idea 	 s 	 	and	information	,	and	,	if	we	're	 luck 	 y 	 	,	some	 entertain 	 ment 	 	.	but	the	 con 	 cept 	 	's	 quit 	 e 	 	the	same	.
and	so	we	have	to	understand	not	 on 	 ly 	 	why	tech	's	 import 	 ant 	 	,	where	it	's	going	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	when	--	the	 tim 	 ing 	 	is	 every 	 thing 	 	.
and	it	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	when	you	look	at	the	 predict 	 ions 	 	made	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	peak	of	the	boom	in	the	1990s	,	about	 e 	 - 	 commerce 	 	,	or	 inter 	 net 	 	traffic	,	or	 broad 	 band 	 	 adopt 	 ion 	 	,	or	 inter 	 net 	 	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	all	right	--	they	 we 	 re 	 	just	wrong	in	time	.
 al 	 most 	 	every	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	come	true	just	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
but	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	of	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	on	stock	-	market	 valu 	 ations 	 	is	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 	.	and	that	's	why	 tim 	 ing 	 	is	 every 	 thing 	 	.
you	've	 prob 	 ably 	 	 s 	 een 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	before	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	classic	gartner	hype	 curv 	 e 	 	,	which	 talk 	 s 	 	about	kind	of	the	 tra 	 ject 	 ory 	 	of	a	technology	's	 life 	 span 	 	.
and	just	for	 f 	 un 	 	,	we	put	a	bunch	of	 techno 	 logies 	 	on	it	,	to	show	 whet 	 her 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	kind	of	 ris 	 ing 	 	for	the	first	high	peak	,	or	 whet 	 her 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	about	to	crash	 in 	 to 	 	the	 t 	 rough 	 	of	 dis 	 illusion 	 ment 	 	,	or	rise	back	in	the	 slop 	 e 	 	of	 enlighten 	 ment 	 	,	etc	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	way	to	do	technology	 fore 	 cast 	 ing 	 	:	get	a	sense	of	where	technology	is	and	then	 anticip 	 ate 	 	the	next	 up 	 turn 	 	.
we	tend	to	do	any	technology	that	we	think	is	 sufficient 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	;	we	'll	 typical 	 ly 	 	do	it	twice	.	once	,	we	want	to	do	it	first	.
we	want	to	be	the	first	to	do	it	,	for	the	 geek 	 s 	 	who	appreciate	that	,	we	'll	catch	it	right	there	at	the	technology	-	trigger	.
you	can	see	in	1997	,	we	put	linux	on	the	cover	.
but	then	it	 come 	 s 	 	back	.	and	 sufficient 	 ly 	 	big	 techno 	 logies 	 	are	going	to	hit	the	 main 	 stream 	 	,	and	they	're	going	to	burst	out	.
and	then	it	's	time	to	do	it	 aga 	 in 	 	.	last	year	.
and	that	's	one	way	that	we	try	to	time	technology	 trend 	 s 	 	.
i	'd	like	to	talk	about	a	way	of	 think 	 ing 	 	about	technology	 trend 	 s 	 	that	i	call	my	``	grand	 un 	 ified 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	of	 predict 	 ing 	 	the	future	,	``	but	it	's	 close 	 r 	 	to	a	 pet 	 ite 	 	 un 	 ified 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	of	 predict 	 ing 	 	the	future	.
it	's	based	on	the	presumption	,	the	 observ 	 ation 	 	even	,	that	all	 import 	 ant 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	go	through	four	 stage 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	life	--	at	 l 	 east 	 	one	of	the	four	 stage 	 s 	 	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	all	four	of	the	 stage 	 s 	 	.
and	at	each	one	of	these	 stage 	 s 	 	,	can	be	 s 	 een 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	collision	--	a	collision	with	 some 	 thing 	 	else	--	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	a	critical	price	-	line	that	 change 	 s 	 	both	the	technology	and	 al 	 so 	 	 change 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	effect	on	the	world	.	it	's	an	 inf 	 le 	 ction 	 	point	.
and	these	are	the	 inf 	 le 	 ction 	 	 point 	 s 	 	that	tell	you	what	the	next	chapter	in	that	technology	's	life	is	going	to	be	,
and	 may 	 be 	 	how	you	can	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	it	.
the	first	is	the	critical	price	.
the	first	stage	in	a	technology	's	advance	is	that	it	'll	fall	 be 	 low 	 	a	critical	price	.
after	it	 fall 	 s 	 	 be 	 low 	 	a	critical	price	,	it	will	tend	,	if	it	's	 success 	 ful 	 	,	to	rise	above	a	critical	mass	,	a	 penet 	 ration 	 	.
 man 	 y 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	at	that	point	,	 dis 	 place 	 	 an 	 other 	 	technology	,	and	that	's	 an 	 other 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	point	.
and	then	 final 	 ly 	 	,	a	lot	of	 techno 	 logies 	 	 commodit 	 ize 	 	.
 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	end	of	 the 	 ir 	 	life	,	they	 be 	 come 	 	 near 	 ly 	 	free	.
each	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	is	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	it	;	it	's	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	for	the	technology	to	change	.
and	even	if	you	 mis 	 s 	 ed 	 	,	you	know	,	the	first	boom	of	wi	-	fi	--	you	know	,	wi	-	fi	did	the	critical	price	,	it	did	the	critical	mass	,	but	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 d 	 one 	 	 dis 	 placement 	 	yet	,	and	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 d 	 one 	 	free	yet	--	there	's	still	more	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	in	that	.
i	'd	like	to	 demonst 	 rate 	 	what	i	mean	by	 th 	 is 	 	by	 tell 	 ing 	 	the	story	of	the	dvd	,	which	is	a	technology	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	all	of	these	.
the	dvd	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	know	,	was	 introduc 	 ed 	 	in	the	mid	-	1990s	and	it	was	 quit 	 e 	 	expensive	.	but	you	can	see	that	by	1998	,	it	had	 fall 	 en 	 	 be 	 low 	 	400	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	and	400	 dollar 	 s 	 	was	a	 psycho 	 logical 	 	threshold	.
and	it	 start 	 ed 	 	to	take	off	.	and	you	can	see	that	the	 unit 	 s 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	to	trend	up	,	the	 hid 	 den 	 	 inf 	 le 	 ction 	 	point	--	it	was	taking	off	.
the	next	thing	it	hit	,	a	year	 lat 	 er 	 	,	was	critical	mass	.	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	20	percent	is	often	a	good	 pr 	 oxy 	 	for	critical	mass	in	a	 house 	 hold 	 	.
and	what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	here	is	that	 some 	 thing 	 	else	took	off	 a 	 long 	 	with	it	:	home	-	theater	 unit 	 s 	 	.
 sudden 	 ly 	 	you	have	a	dvd	in	the	house	;	you	've	got	high	-	quality	digital	video	;	you	have	a	reason	to	have	a	big	-	screen	 tele 	 vision 	 	;	you	have	a	reason	for	dolby	5.1	surround	-	sound	.
and	 may 	 be 	 	you	have	 reason 	 s 	 	for	 start 	 ing 	 	to	connect	them	,	and	 br 	 ing 	 	the	rest	of	your	 entertain 	 ment 	 	in	.
what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	 al 	 so 	 	is	--	note	that	netflix	was	 found 	 ed 	 	in	1999	.
 re 	 ed 	 	hastings	is	here	.	he	 clear 	 ly 	 	saw	that	that	was	a	moment	,	that	was	an	 inf 	 le 	 ction 	 	point	that	he	could	do	 some 	 thing 	 	with	.
the	next	phase	it	hit	was	 dis 	 placement 	 	.
you	can	see	around	2001	it	 final 	 ly 	 	out	-	 s 	 old 	 	the	vcr	.
and	here	too	,	you	can	see	the	 implic 	 ations 	 	in	the	world	at	large	.
netflix	was	right	--	the	netflix	model	could	 capital 	 ize 	 	on	the	dvd	in	a	way	that	the	video	-	 rent 	 al 	 	 store 	 s 	 	could	n't	.
among	the	dvd	's	 man 	 y 	 	 asset 	 s 	 	is	that	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	small	;	you	can	stick	it	in	the	 mail 	 er 	 	and	post	it	 cheap 	 ly 	 	.
that	 g 	 ave 	 	an	advantage	;	that	was	an	 implic 	 ation 	 	of	the	technology	's	rise	that	was	n't	obvious	to	 every 	 body 	 	.
and	then	 final 	 ly 	 	,	dvds	are	 approach 	 ing 	 	free	.
there	's	a	company	 call 	 ed 	 	 ap 	 ex 	 	,	a	no	-	name	chinese	firm	,	who	 ha 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 time 	 s 	 	in	the	past	year	,	 be 	 en 	 	the	number	-	one	dvd	seller	in	america	.	 the 	 ir 	 	average	price	,	for	last	year	,	was	48	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
you	're	aware	of	the	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 a 	 po 	 cry 	 phal 	 	wal	-	mart	stampede	over	the	30	-	dollar	dvd	.
but	they	're	 get 	 ting 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	cheap	,	and	look	at	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	 implic 	 ation 	 	of	it	.	 a 	 s 	 	they	get	 cheap 	 er 	 	,	the	 pre 	 mium 	 	 brand 	 s 	 	,	the	sonys	and	 s 	 uch 	 	,	are	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	market	share	,	and	the	no	-	 name 	 s 	 	,	the	apexes	,	are	 gain 	 ing 	 	them	.
they	're	 be 	 ing 	 	 com 	 modifi 	 ed 	 	,	and	that	's	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	 thing 	 s 	 	go	to	zero	.	it	's	a	tough	market	out	there	.
now	they	've	 introduc 	 ed 	 	these	four	ways	of	looking	at	technology	,	these	four	 stage 	 s 	 	of	technology	's	life	.
i	'd	like	to	talk	about	some	other	 techno 	 logies 	 	out	there	,	just	 techno 	 logies 	 	on	our	radar	--	and	i	'll	use	 th 	 is 	 	lens	,	these	four	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	way	to	kind	of	tell	you	where	each	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	is	in	 it 	 s 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
they	're	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	the	top	-	10	 techno 	 logies 	 	out	there	--	they	're	just	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	 techno 	 logies 	 	that	are	in	each	one	of	these	 period 	 s 	 	.
but	i	think	that	the	 implic 	 ations 	 	of	them	 approach 	 ing 	 	these	 cross 	 over 	 s 	 	,	these	 intersect 	 ions 	 	,	are	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	think	about	.
start	with	gene	 s 	 equ 	 encing 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	know	,	gene	 s 	 equ 	 encing 	 	--	in	a	large	part	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	built	on	 computer 	 s 	 	--	is	 fall 	 ing 	 	in	price	at	a	kind	of	a	moore	's	law	-	like	level	.
it	is	now	possible	--	will	be	possible	,	and	if	craig	venter	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	 come 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	he	may	tell	you	 some 	 thing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	--	to	sequence	the	human	genome	for	40	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	by	the	end	of	 th 	 is 	 	year	.
that	's	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	 billion 	 s 	 	just	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
you	know	,	our	ability	to	capture	the	 tool 	 s 	 	of	creation	is	 get 	 ting 	 	 close 	 r 	 	and	 close 	 r 	 	.
what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	that	at	the	same	time	,	the	number	of	 gene 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 discover 	 ing 	 	is	 ris 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.	each	one	of	these	 gene 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	potential	 diagnos 	 tic 	 	test	.
there	will	come	a	day	when	you	can	have	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 test 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 cheap 	 ly 	 	,	if	you	want	to	know	.	you	can	learn	about	your	own	mosaic	.
here	's	 an 	 other 	 	technology	that	's	 approach 	 ing 	 	a	critical	price	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 fasci 	 nating 	 	research	from	who	that	 show 	 s 	 	the	effect	of	generic	 drug 	 s 	 	on	anti	-	retroviral	drug	 com 	 pound 	 s 	 	and	 cock 	 tail 	 s 	 	.
in	january	2000	,	the	price	was	10,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	or	27	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	day	.
the	 generic 	 s 	 	came	in	,	first	in	brazil	and	 else 	 where 	 	,	and	the	effect	was	just	 dramat 	 ic 	 	on	 pric 	 ing 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	it	's	less	than	50	 cent 	 s 	 	a	day	.
and	what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	if	you	look	at	the	price	 elastic 	 ity 	 	,	if	you	look	at	the	correlation	between	these	two	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	anti	-	retrovirals	come	down	,	the	number	of	people	you	can	treat	 go 	 es 	 	 radical 	 ly 	 	up	.	and	the	clinton	 found 	 ation 	 	and	who	 believ 	 e 	 	that	they	can	treat	three	million	people	 world 	 wide 	 	by	2005	--	two	million	in	sub	-	saharan	africa	.
and	the	 fall 	 ing 	 	price	of	 drug 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	lot	to	do	with	that	.	linux	is	 an 	 other 	 	good	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
now	we	've	 s 	 witch 	 ed 	 	to	critical	mass	.
these	are	now	 techno 	 logies 	 	that	are	hitting	critical	mass	.
if	you	look	here	,	here	's	linux	in	red	,	and	it	's	hit	20	percent	.	 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	 d 	 one 	 	a	 cross 	 over 	 	before	,	but	not	the	 cross 	 over 	 s 	 	that	matter	.
the	 cross 	 over 	 	that	's	going	to	matter	is	the	one	with	the	blue	.
but	you	can	look	and	see	the	direction	 t 	 hose 	 	lines	are	going	,	you	can	see	that	at	the	20	percent	,	it	's	now	taken	 serious 	 ly 	 	.
it	's	not	just	for	the	 geek 	 s 	 	any	more	.
that	is	,	i	imagine	,	what	people	in	redmond	wake	up	in	the	middle	of	the	night	 think 	 ing 	 	about	.
 an 	 other 	 	technology	that	we	see	all	around	us	out	here	is	hybrid	 car 	 s 	 	.
i	do	n't	know	 whet 	 her 	 	 any 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	prius	2004	,	but	they	're	fantastic	.
and	if	you	look	at	the	 trend 	 s 	 	here	,	by	about	2008	--	and	i	do	n't	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	crazy	 fore 	 cast 	 	--	they	'll	be	two	percent	of	auto	 sale 	 s 	 	.
two	percent	is	n't	20	percent	,	but	in	the	car	business	,	which	is	 s 	 low 	 	moving	,	that	's	huge	;	that	's	 arriv 	 al 	 	.
at	two	percent	,	you	start	 see 	 ing 	 	them	on	the	 road 	 s 	 	 every 	 where 	 	.
and	what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	about	the	 hybrid 	 s 	 	taking	off	is	you	've	now	 introduc 	 ed 	 	electric	 motor 	 s 	 	to	the	 auto 	 mobile 	 	industry	.
it	's	the	first	radical	change	in	 auto 	 mobile 	 	technology	in	100	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	once	you	have	electric	 motor 	 s 	 	,	you	can	do	 any 	 thing 	 	:	you	can	change	the	structure	of	the	car	in	any	way	you	want	.
you	can	have	 re 	 generative 	 	 bra 	 king 	 	;	you	can	have	drive	-	by	-	wire	;	you	can	have	 replace 	 able 	 	body	 shape 	 s 	 	--	it	's	a	little	thing	that	 start 	 s 	 	with	a	hybrid	,	but	it	can	lead	to	a	whole	new	era	of	the	car	.
voice	over	ip	is	 some 	 thing 	 	you	may	have	heard	 some 	 thing 	 	about	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	it	's	kind	of	coming	out	of	 no 	 where 	 	;	it	's	a	little	hard	to	use	right	now	.
there	's	a	company	 create 	 d 	 	by	the	kazaa	 founder 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	skype	.
look	at	these	 number 	 s 	 	.	they	 launch 	 ed 	 	it	in	august	of	last	year	;	they	 al 	 ready 	 	have	 near 	 ly 	 	four	million	 register 	 ed 	 	 user 	 s 	 	--	that	's	critical	mass	.
and	the	same	thing	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	on	the	 car 	 rier 	 	side	.
you	're	looking	at	ip	taking	over	from	some	of	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	 tele 	 com 	 	 standard 	 s 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 tip 	 ping 	 	point	--	if	malcolm	's	here	,	forgive	me	--	and	it	's	going	to	change	the	 economic 	 s 	 	,	and	the	speed	,	and	the	 player 	 s 	 	in	the	industry	.	it	's	going	to	look	a	little	bit	like	that	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	free	.	free	is	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
free	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 come 	 s 	 	with	digital	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 re 	 production 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	are	 essential 	 ly 	 	free	.	it	 come 	 s 	 	with	ip	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 s 	 uch 	 	an	efficient	 proto 	 col 	 	.	it	 come 	 s 	 	with	fiber	 optic 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	so	much	 band 	 width 	 	.
free	is	 re 	 ally 	 	,	you	know	,	the	gift	of	silicon	 val 	 ley 	 	to	the	world	.
it	's	an	economic	force	;	it	's	a	technical	force	.
it	's	a	 defl 	 ation 	 ary 	 	force	,	if	not	 handle 	 d 	 	right	.
it	is	abundance	,	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	 scar 	 city 	 	.
free	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	most	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	.
and	here	you	have	just	the	number	of	 song 	 s 	 	that	can	be	 store 	 d 	 	on	a	hard	drive	.
you	know	,	there	could	be	a	film	's	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	there	,	but	it	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	every	song	ever	made	could	be	 store 	 d 	 	on	400	 dollar 	 s 	 	worth	of	 s 	 to 	 rage 	 	by	2008	.	it	 take 	 s 	 	that	entire	element	,	the	physical	element	,	of	 song 	 s 	 	off	the	table	.
and	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	the	 number 	 s 	 	.
i	mean	,	you	know	,	the	music	industry	is	 implod 	 ing 	 	in	front	of	our	 ver 	 y 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	,	and	hollywood	's	 worri 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
they	're	facing	a	force	that	they	have	n't	 face 	 d 	 	before	.
and	 the 	 ir 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	is	 dra 	 con 	 ian 	 	,	and	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	the	one	that	's	going	to	get	them	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	i	'll	give	you	one	last	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	free	--	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	the	most	 power 	 ful 	 	of	all	.	i	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	fiber	 optic 	 s 	 	--	 the 	 ir 	 	abundance	 tend 	 s 	 	to	make	 thing 	 s 	 	free	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	price	of	a	phone	call	to	india	per	minute	.
and	what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	that	it	was	just	1990	when	it	was	more	than	two	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	minute	.
india	had	,	still	 ha 	 s 	 	,	a	 regulat 	 ed 	 	phone	system	and	so	did	we	.
it	was	 surprising 	 ly 	 	non	-	 innov 	 ative 	 	,	 move 	 d 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	,	but	then	there	was	just	so	much	fiber	out	there	,	you	could	n't	hold	back	,	and	look	how	 quick 	 ly 	 	the	price	fell	.
it	's	seven	 cent 	 s 	 	a	minute	,	in	 man 	 y 	 	 case 	 s 	 	.
and	the	 con 	 sequence 	 	of	cheap	phone	 call 	 ing 	 	,	free	phone	 call 	 ing 	 	,	to	india	,	is	the	 piss 	 ed 	 	-	off	 programm 	 er 	 	,	is	the	 out 	 sourcing 	 	.
it	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	one	of	the	most	 dramat 	 ic 	 	 shift 	 s 	 	in	 global 	 ization 	 	and	one	of	the	most	 power 	 ful 	 	economic	 tool 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	in	our	world	 to 	 day 	 	.
the	force	of	india	,	and	then	 chin 	 a 	 	,	and	any	other	country	that	can	contact	our	 market 	 s 	 	and	will	work	with	our	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 communication 	 s 	 	are	free	--	is	just	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	be	felt	.
and	i	think	that	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	one	of	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	technology	 trend 	 s 	 	that	we	're	looking	at	 to 	 day 	 	.
thank	you	.
