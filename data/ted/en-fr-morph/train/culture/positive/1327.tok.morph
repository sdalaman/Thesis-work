one	of	the	most	common	ways	of	 divid 	 ing 	 	the	world	is	 in 	 to 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	who	 believ 	 e 	 	and	 t 	 hose 	 	who	do	n't	--	 in 	 to 	 	the	religious	and	the	 atheist 	 s 	 	.
and	for	the	last	decade	or	so	,	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	clear	what	 be 	 ing 	 	an	atheist	 mean 	 s 	 	.
there	have	 be 	 en 	 	some	 ver 	 y 	 	vocal	 atheist 	 s 	 	who	've	 point 	 ed 	 	out	,	not	just	that	 relig 	 ion 	 	is	wrong	,	but	that	it	's	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	.
these	people	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	whom	have	lived	in	north	oxford	,	have	 argu 	 ed 	 	--	they	've	 argu 	 ed 	 	that	 believ 	 ing 	 	in	god	is	 a 	 kin 	 	to	 believ 	 ing 	 	in	 fair 	 ies 	 	and	 essential 	 ly 	 	that	the	whole	thing	is	a	 child 	 ish 	 	game	.
now	i	think	it	's	too	easy	.
i	think	it	's	too	easy	to	dismiss	the	whole	of	 relig 	 ion 	 	that	way	.
and	it	's	 a 	 s 	 	easy	 a 	 s 	 	 shoot 	 ing 	 	fish	in	a	barrel	.
and	what	i	'd	like	to	 inaugu 	 rate 	 	 to 	 day 	 	is	a	new	way	of	 be 	 ing 	 	an	atheist	--	if	you	like	,	a	new	version	of	 a 	 theism 	 	we	could	call	 a 	 theism 	 	2.0	.
now	what	is	 a 	 theism 	 	2.0	?
well	it	 start 	 s 	 	from	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 bas 	 ic 	 	 pre 	 mise 	 	:	of	course	,	there	's	no	god	.
of	course	,	there	are	no	 de 	 ities 	 	or	 super 	 natural 	 	 spirit 	 s 	 	or	 angel 	 s 	 	,	etc	.
now	let	's	move	on	;	that	's	not	the	end	of	the	story	,	that	's	the	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
i	'm	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	kind	of	 constit 	 uency 	 	that	 think 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 a 	 long 	 	these	lines	:	that	 think 	 s 	 	,	``	i	ca	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	in	any	of	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	.
i	ca	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	in	the	 doctri 	 nes 	 	.
i	do	n't	think	these	 doctri 	 nes 	 	are	right	.
but	,	``	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	but	,	``	i	love	christmas	 car 	 ol 	 s 	 	.
i	 re 	 ally 	 	like	the	art	of	mantegna	.
i	 re 	 ally 	 	like	looking	at	old	 church 	 es 	 	.
i	 re 	 ally 	 	like	 turn 	 ing 	 	the	 page 	 s 	 	of	the	old	 test 	 a 	 ment 	 	.	``	 what 	 ever 	 	it	may	be	,	you	know	the	kind	of	thing	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	--	people	who	are	 attract 	 ed 	 	to	the	 ritual 	 istic 	 	side	,	the	 moral 	 istic 	 	,	 commun 	 al 	 	side	of	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	but	ca	n't	bear	the	 doctri 	 ne 	 	.
 un 	 til 	 	now	,	these	people	have	 face 	 d 	 	a	 ra 	 ther 	 	 un 	 pleas 	 ant 	 	choice	.
it	's	 al 	 most 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	either	you	accept	the	 doctri 	 ne 	 	and	then	you	can	have	all	the	nice	stuff	,	or	you	reject	the	 doctri 	 ne 	 	and	you	're	living	in	some	kind	of	spiritual	 waste 	 land 	 	under	the	 gui 	 dance 	 	of	cnn	and	walmart	.
so	that	's	a	sort	of	tough	choice	.
i	do	n't	think	we	have	to	make	that	choice	.
i	think	there	is	an	 alter 	 native 	 	.
i	think	there	are	ways	--	and	i	'm	 be 	 ing 	 	both	 ver 	 y 	 	 respect 	 ful 	 	and	 complete 	 ly 	 	 imp 	 ious 	 	--	of	 steal 	 ing 	 	from	 relig 	 ions 	 	.
if	you	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	in	a	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	wrong	with	 pick 	 ing 	 	and	 mix 	 ing 	 	,	with	taking	out	the	best	 side 	 s 	 	of	 relig 	 ion 	 	.
and	for	me	,	 a 	 theism 	 	2.0	is	about	both	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	say	,	a	 respect 	 ful 	 	and	an	 imp 	 ious 	 	way	of	going	through	 relig 	 ions 	 	and	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	what	here	could	we	use	?	``	the	secular	world	is	full	of	 hole 	 s 	 	.
we	have	 secular 	 ized 	 	 bad 	 ly 	 	,	i	would	 argu 	 e 	 	.
and	a	thorough	 stud 	 y 	 	of	 relig 	 ion 	 	could	give	us	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 in 	 sight 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 area 	 s 	 	of	life	that	are	not	going	too	well	.
and	i	'd	like	to	run	through	a	few	of	these	 to 	 day 	 	.
i	'd	like	to	kick	off	by	looking	at	education	.
now	education	is	a	field	the	secular	world	 re 	 ally 	 	 believ 	 es 	 	in	.
when	we	think	about	how	we	're	going	to	make	the	world	a	better	place	,	we	think	education	;	that	's	where	we	put	a	lot	of	money	.
education	is	going	to	give	us	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	commercial	 skill 	 s 	 	,	industrial	 skill 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	going	to	make	us	better	people	.
you	know	the	kind	of	thing	a	 commen 	 cement 	 	address	is	,	and	 gradu 	 ation 	 	 ceremoni 	 es 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 lyric 	 al 	 	 claim 	 s 	 	that	education	,	the	process	of	education	--	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 high 	 er 	 	education	--	will	make	us	 in 	 to 	 	 noble 	 r 	 	and	better	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
that	's	a	 love 	 ly 	 	idea	.
 interest 	 ing 	 	where	it	came	from	.
in	the	early	19th	century	,	church	 attend 	 ance 	 	in	western	europe	 start 	 ed 	 	 slid 	 ing 	 	down	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 sharp 	 ly 	 	,	and	people	 panic 	 ked 	 	.
they	 ask 	 ed 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	question	.	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	where	are	people	going	to	find	the	 moral 	 ity 	 	,	where	are	they	going	to	find	 gui 	 dance 	 	,	and	where	are	they	going	to	find	 source 	 s 	 	of	 consol 	 ation 	 	?
and	 in 	 fluent 	 ial 	 	 voice 	 s 	 	came	up	with	one	answer	.
they	 s 	 aid 	 	culture	.
it	's	to	culture	that	we	should	look	for	 gui 	 dance 	 	,	for	 consol 	 ation 	 	,	for	 moral 	 ity 	 	.
let	's	look	to	the	 play 	 s 	 	of	shakespeare	,	the	 dia 	 logues 	 	of	plato	,	the	 novel 	 s 	 	of	jane	austen	.
in	there	,	we	'll	find	a	lot	of	the	 truth 	 s 	 	that	we	might	 previous 	 ly 	 	have	found	in	the	 go 	 s 	 pel 	 	of	saint	john	.
now	i	think	that	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	idea	and	a	 ver 	 y 	 	true	idea	.
they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	replace	 script 	 ure 	 	with	culture	.
and	that	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	plausible	idea	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	an	idea	that	we	have	 for 	 gotten 	 	.
if	you	went	to	a	top	university	--	let	's	say	you	went	to	harvard	or	oxford	or	cambridge	--	and	you	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	've	come	here	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	in	search	of	 moral 	 ity 	 	,	 gui 	 dance 	 	and	 consol 	 ation 	 	;	i	want	to	know	how	to	live	,	``	they	would	show	you	the	way	to	the	 insan 	 e 	 	asylum	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 simpl 	 y 	 	not	what	our	 grand 	 est 	 	and	best	 institute 	 s 	 	of	 high 	 er 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	are	in	the	business	of	.
why	?	they	do	n't	think	we	need	it	.
they	do	n't	think	we	are	in	an	 urge 	 nt 	 	need	of	 assist 	 ance 	 	.
they	see	us	 a 	 s 	 	 adult 	 s 	 	,	rational	 adult 	 s 	 	.
what	we	need	is	information	.
we	need	data	,	we	do	n't	need	help	.
now	 relig 	 ions 	 	start	from	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	place	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	.
all	 relig 	 ions 	 	,	all	major	 relig 	 ions 	 	,	at	 vari 	 ous 	 	 point 	 s 	 	call	us	children	.
and	like	children	,	they	 believ 	 e 	 	that	we	are	in	severe	need	of	 assist 	 ance 	 	.
we	're	 on 	 ly 	 	just	 hold 	 ing 	 	it	together	.
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	me	,	 may 	 be 	 	you	.
but	 any 	 way 	 	,	we	're	 on 	 ly 	 	just	 hold 	 ing 	 	it	together	.
and	we	need	help	.	of	course	,	we	need	help	.
and	so	we	need	 gui 	 dance 	 	and	we	need	 did 	 act 	 ic 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	.
you	know	,	in	the	18th	century	in	the	u.k.	,	the	 great 	 est 	 	 preach 	 er 	 	,	 great 	 est 	 	religious	 preach 	 er 	 	,	was	a	man	 call 	 ed 	 	john	wesley	,	who	went	up	and	down	 th 	 is 	 	country	 deliver 	 ing 	 	 sermon 	 s 	 	,	 ad 	 vis 	 ing 	 	people	how	they	could	live	.
he	 deliver 	 ed 	 	 sermon 	 s 	 	on	the	 du 	 ties 	 	of	 parent 	 s 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	children	and	children	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	,	the	 du 	 ties 	 	of	the	rich	to	the	poor	and	the	poor	to	the	rich	.
he	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	tell	people	how	they	should	live	through	the	medium	of	 sermon 	 s 	 	,	the	classic	medium	of	 deliver 	 y 	 	of	 relig 	 ions 	 	.
now	we	've	 give 	 n 	 	up	with	the	idea	of	 sermon 	 s 	 	.
if	you	 s 	 aid 	 	to	a	modern	liberal	 individual 	 ist 	 	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	how	about	a	sermon	?	``	they	'd	go	,	``	no	,	no	.	i	do	n't	need	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	.
i	'm	an	 in 	 dependent 	 	,	individual	person	.	``	what	's	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	a	sermon	and	our	modern	,	secular	mode	of	 deliver 	 y 	 	,	the	 lectur 	 e 	 	?
well	a	sermon	 want 	 s 	 	to	change	your	life	and	a	 lectur 	 e 	 	 want 	 s 	 	to	give	you	a	bit	of	information	.
and	i	think	we	need	to	get	back	to	that	sermon	tradition	.
the	tradition	of	 sermon 	 izing 	 	is	 huge 	 ly 	 	 valu 	 able 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	are	in	need	of	 gui 	 dance 	 	,	 moral 	 ity 	 	and	 consol 	 ation 	 	--	and	 relig 	 ions 	 	know	that	.
 an 	 other 	 	point	about	education	:	we	tend	to	 believ 	 e 	 	in	the	modern	secular	world	that	if	you	tell	 some 	 one 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	once	,	they	'll	remember	it	.
 s 	 it 	 	them	in	a	 class 	 room 	 	,	tell	them	about	plato	at	the	age	of	20	,	 s 	 end 	 	them	out	for	a	 care 	 er 	 	in	management	 consult 	 ancy 	 	for	40	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	that	 less 	 on 	 	will	stick	with	them	.
 relig 	 ions 	 	go	,	``	 non 	 sense 	 	.
you	need	to	keep	 repeat 	 ing 	 	the	 less 	 on 	 	10	 time 	 s 	 	a	day	.
so	get	on	your	 knee 	 s 	 	and	repeat	it	.	``	that	's	what	all	 relig 	 ions 	 	tell	us	:	``	get	on	you	 knee 	 s 	 	and	repeat	it	10	or	20	or	15	 time 	 s 	 	a	day	.	``	 other 	 wise 	 	our	 mind 	 s 	 	are	like	 sieve 	 s 	 	.
so	 relig 	 ions 	 	are	 culture 	 s 	 	of	 re 	 petition 	 	.
they	circle	the	great	 truth 	 s 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	.
we	associate	 re 	 petition 	 	with	 bore 	 dom 	 	.
``	give	us	the	new	,	``	we	're	 al 	 ways 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	.
``	the	new	is	better	than	the	old	.	``
if	i	 s 	 aid 	 	to	you	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	we	're	not	going	to	have	new	ted	.
we	're	just	going	to	run	through	all	the	old	 one 	 s 	 	and	watch	them	five	 time 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	so	true	.
we	're	going	to	watch	elizabeth	gilbert	five	 time 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	what	she	 say 	 s 	 	is	so	clever	,	``	you	'd	feel	 cheat 	 ed 	 	.
not	so	if	you	're	 adopt 	 ing 	 	a	religious	 mind 	 set 	 	.
the	other	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 relig 	 ions 	 	do	is	to	arrange	time	.
all	the	major	 relig 	 ions 	 	give	us	 calendar 	 s 	 	.
what	is	a	calendar	?
a	calendar	is	a	way	of	making	 s 	 ure 	 	that	 a 	 cross 	 	the	year	you	will	bump	 in 	 to 	 	certain	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	.
in	the	catholic	 chrono 	 logy 	 	,	catholic	calendar	,	at	the	end	of	march	you	will	think	about	st.	jerome	and	his	 qual 	 ities 	 	of	 humil 	 ity 	 	and	 good 	 ness 	 	and	his	 gene 	 ros 	 ity 	 	to	the	poor	.
you	wo	n't	do	that	by	accident	;	you	will	do	that	 be 	 cause 	 	you	are	 guide 	 d 	 	to	do	that	.
now	we	do	n't	think	that	way	.
in	the	secular	world	we	think	,	``	if	an	idea	is	 import 	 ant 	 	,	i	'll	bump	 in 	 to 	 	it	.
i	'll	just	come	 a 	 cross 	 	it	.	``	 non 	 sense 	 	,	 say 	 s 	 	the	religious	world	view	.
religious	view	 say 	 s 	 	we	need	 calendar 	 s 	 	,	we	need	to	structure	time	,	we	need	to	 synchron 	 ize 	 	 en 	 counter 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 come 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	 al 	 so 	 	in	the	way	in	which	 relig 	 ions 	 	set	up	 ritual 	 s 	 	around	 import 	 ant 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
take	the	moon	.	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	look	at	the	moon	.
you	know	,	when	you	look	at	the	moon	,	you	think	,	``	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	small	.	what	are	my	 problem 	 s 	 	?	``	it	 set 	 s 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	etc	.	,	etc	.
we	should	all	look	at	the	moon	a	bit	more	often	.	we	do	n't	.
why	do	n't	we	?	well	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	tell	us	,	``	look	at	the	moon	.	``	but	if	you	're	a	zen	buddhist	in	the	middle	of	september	,	you	will	be	 order 	 ed 	 	out	of	your	home	,	made	to	stand	on	a	 can 	 on 	 ical 	 	platform	and	made	to	 celebr 	 ate 	 	the	 fest 	 ival 	 	of	tsukimi	,	where	you	will	be	 give 	 n 	 	 poem 	 s 	 	to	read	in	honor	of	the	moon	and	the	 pass 	 age 	 	of	time	and	the	 f 	 rail 	 ty 	 	of	life	that	it	should	 re 	 mind 	 	us	of	.
you	'll	be	 hand 	 ed 	 	rice	 cake 	 s 	 	.
and	the	moon	and	the	 reflect 	 ion 	 	on	the	moon	will	have	a	secure	place	in	your	heart	.
that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	good	.
the	other	thing	that	 relig 	 ions 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	aware	of	is	:	speak	well	--	i	'm	not	 do 	 ing 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	job	of	 th 	 is 	 	here	--	but	 or 	 atory 	 	,	 or 	 atory 	 	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	key	to	 relig 	 ions 	 	.
in	the	secular	world	,	you	can	come	through	the	university	system	and	be	a	 lous 	 y 	 	speaker	and	still	have	a	great	 care 	 er 	 	.
but	the	religious	world	 do 	 es 	 	n't	think	that	way	.
what	you	're	 say 	 ing 	 	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 back 	 ed 	 	up	by	a	 re 	 ally 	 	convincing	way	of	 say 	 ing 	 	it	.
so	if	you	go	to	an	african	american	pentecostalist	church	in	the	american	south	and	you	listen	to	how	they	talk	,	my	 good 	 ness 	 	,	they	talk	well	.
after	every	convincing	point	,	people	will	go	,	``	 a 	 men 	 	,	 a 	 men 	 	,	 a 	 men 	 	.	``	at	the	end	of	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 r 	 ous 	 ing 	 	 para 	 graph 	 	,	they	'll	all	stand	up	,	and	they	'll	go	,	``	thank	you	jesus	,	thank	you	christ	,	thank	you	savior	.	``	if	we	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	it	like	they	do	it	--	let	's	not	do	it	,	but	if	we	 we 	 re 	 	to	do	it	--	i	would	tell	you	 some 	 thing 	 	like	,	``	culture	should	replace	 script 	 ure 	 	.	``	and	you	would	go	,	``	 a 	 men 	 	,	 a 	 men 	 	,	 a 	 men 	 	.	``	and	at	the	end	of	my	talk	,	you	would	all	stand	up	and	you	would	go	,	``	thank	you	plato	,	thank	you	shakespeare	,	thank	you	jane	austen	.	``	and	we	'd	know	that	we	had	a	real	rhythm	going	.
all	right	,	all	right	.	we	're	 get 	 ting 	 	there	.	we	're	 get 	 ting 	 	there	.
the	other	thing	that	 relig 	 ions 	 	know	is	we	're	not	just	 brain 	 s 	 	,	we	are	 al 	 so 	 	bodies	.
and	when	they	teach	us	a	 less 	 on 	 	,	they	do	it	via	the	body	.
so	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	take	the	jewish	idea	of	 forgive 	 ness 	 	.
jews	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 forgive 	 ness 	 	and	how	we	should	start	 a 	 new 	 	and	start	 a 	 fresh 	 	.
they	do	n't	just	deliver	us	 sermon 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
they	do	n't	just	give	us	 book 	 s 	 	or	 word 	 s 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
they	tell	us	to	have	a	bath	.
so	in	orthodox	jewish	 commun 	 ities 	 	,	every	friday	you	go	to	a	mikveh	.
you	 immers 	 e 	 	 your 	 self 	 	in	the	water	,	and	a	physical	action	 back 	 s 	 	up	a	 philosoph 	 ical 	 	idea	.
we	do	n't	tend	to	do	that	.
our	 idea 	 s 	 	are	in	one	area	and	our	behavior	with	our	bodies	is	in	 an 	 other 	 	.
 relig 	 ions 	 	are	 fasci 	 nating 	 	in	the	way	they	try	and	combine	the	two	.
let	's	look	at	art	now	.
now	art	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	in	the	secular	world	,	we	think	 ver 	 y 	 	 high 	 ly 	 	of	.	we	think	art	is	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
a	lot	of	our	 sur 	 plus 	 	wealth	 go 	 es 	 	to	 museum 	 s 	 	,	etc	.
we	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	hear	it	 s 	 aid 	 	that	 museum 	 s 	 	are	our	new	 cat 	 hedral 	 s 	 	,	or	our	new	 church 	 es 	 	.
you	've	heard	that	 say 	 ing 	 	.
now	i	think	that	the	potential	is	there	,
but	we	've	 complete 	 ly 	 	let	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	down	.
and	the	reason	we	've	let	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	down	is	that	we	're	not	 proper 	 ly 	 	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	how	 relig 	 ions 	 	handle	art	.
the	two	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	 idea 	 s 	 	that	are	 hover 	 ing 	 	in	the	modern	world	that	inhibit	our	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	draw	strength	from	art	:	the	first	idea	is	that	art	should	be	for	art	's	sake	--	a	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	idea	--	an	idea	that	art	should	live	in	a	 her 	 me 	 tic 	 	bubble	and	should	not	try	to	do	 any 	 thing 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	 trouble 	 d 	 	world	.
i	could	n't	disagree	more	.
the	other	thing	that	we	 believ 	 e 	 	is	that	art	should	n't	explain	 it 	 self 	 	,	that	 artist 	 s 	 	should	n't	say	what	they	're	up	to	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	they	 s 	 aid 	 	it	,	it	might	destroy	the	spell	and	we	might	find	it	too	easy	.
that	's	why	a	 ver 	 y 	 	common	 feel 	 ing 	 	when	you	're	in	a	museum	--	let	's	admit	it	--	is	,	``	i	do	n't	know	what	 th 	 is 	 	is	about	.	``	but	if	we	're	serious	people	,	we	do	n't	admit	to	that	.
but	that	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	 puzzl 	 ement 	 	is	structural	to	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	art	.
now	 relig 	 ions 	 	have	a	much	 s 	 an 	 er 	 	attitude	to	art	.
they	have	no	trouble	 tell 	 ing 	 	us	what	art	is	about	.
art	is	about	two	 thing 	 s 	 	in	all	the	major	 faith 	 s 	 	.
 first 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 re 	 mind 	 	you	of	what	there	is	to	love	.
and	 second 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 re 	 mind 	 	you	of	what	there	is	to	fear	and	to	hate	.
and	that	's	what	art	is	.
art	is	a	visceral	 en 	 counter 	 	with	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	of	your	faith	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	you	walk	around	a	church	,	or	a	mosque	or	a	 cat 	 hedral 	 	,	what	you	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 imbib 	 e 	 	,	what	you	're	 imbib 	 ing 	 	is	,	through	your	 eye 	 s 	 	,	through	your	 sense 	 s 	 	,	 truth 	 s 	 	that	have	 other 	 wise 	 	come	to	you	through	your	mind	.
 essential 	 ly 	 	it	's	 propag 	 and 	 a 	 	.
rembrandt	is	a	 propag 	 and 	 ist 	 	in	the	christian	view	.
now	the	word	``	 propag 	 and 	 a 	 	``	 set 	 s 	 	off	alarm	 bell 	 s 	 	.
we	think	of	hitler	,	we	think	of	stalin	.	do	n't	,	 necess 	 arily 	 	.
 propag 	 and 	 a 	 	is	a	manner	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 did 	 act 	 ic 	 	in	honor	of	 some 	 thing 	 	.
and	if	that	thing	is	good	,	there	's	no	problem	with	it	at	all	.
my	view	is	that	 museum 	 s 	 	should	take	a	leaf	out	of	the	book	of	 relig 	 ions 	 	.
and	they	should	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	when	you	walk	 in 	 to 	 	a	museum	--	if	i	was	a	museum	 cur 	 ator 	 	,	i	would	make	a	room	for	love	,	a	room	for	 gene 	 ros 	 ity 	 	.
all	 work 	 s 	 	of	art	are	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	us	about	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	if	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	arrange	 space 	 s 	 	where	we	could	come	 a 	 cross 	 	 work 	 s 	 	where	we	would	be	told	,	use	these	 work 	 s 	 	of	art	to	cement	these	 idea 	 s 	 	in	your	mind	,	we	would	get	a	lot	more	out	of	art	.
art	would	pick	up	the	duty	that	it	used	to	have	and	that	we	've	 neglect 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	certain	mis	-	 found 	 ed 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	.
art	should	be	one	of	the	 tool 	 s 	 	by	which	we	improve	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
art	should	be	 did 	 act 	 ic 	 	.
let	's	think	of	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
the	people	in	the	modern	world	,	in	the	secular	world	,	who	are	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 matter 	 s 	 	of	the	spirit	,	in	 matter 	 s 	 	of	the	mind	,	in	 high 	 er 	 	soul	-	like	 concern 	 s 	 	,	tend	to	be	 isolate 	 d 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	.
they	're	 poet 	 s 	 	,	they	're	 philosoph 	 ers 	 	,	they	're	 photograph 	 ers 	 	,	they	're	 film 	 makers 	 	.
and	they	tend	to	be	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	.
they	're	our	cottage	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	.	they	are	 vulner 	 able 	 	,	single	people	.
and	they	get	 depress 	 ed 	 	and	they	get	 s 	 ad 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	.
and	they	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	change	much	.
now	think	about	 relig 	 ions 	 	,	think	about	 organize 	 d 	 	 relig 	 ions 	 	.
what	do	 organize 	 d 	 	 relig 	 ions 	 	do	?
they	group	together	,	they	form	 institution 	 s 	 	.
and	that	 ha 	 s 	 	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 advantage 	 s 	 	.
first	of	all	,	scale	,	might	.
the	catholic	church	 pull 	 ed 	 	in	97	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	last	year	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	the	wall	street	journal	.
these	are	massive	 machine 	 s 	 	.
they	're	 collabor 	 ative 	 	,	they	're	 brand 	 ed 	 	,	they	're	 multi 	 national 	 	,	and	they	're	 high 	 ly 	 	 discipline 	 d 	 	.
these	are	all	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 qual 	 ities 	 	.
we	 recogn 	 ize 	 	them	in	relation	to	 corporation 	 s 	 	.
and	 corporation 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	like	 relig 	 ions 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	they	're	right	down	at	the	bottom	of	the	pyramid	of	 need 	 s 	 	.
they	're	selling	us	 shoe 	 s 	 	and	 car 	 s 	 	.
 where 	 a 	 s 	 	the	people	who	are	selling	us	the	 high 	 er 	 	stuff	--	the	 therapist 	 s 	 	,	the	 poet 	 s 	 	--	are	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	and	they	have	no	power	,	they	have	no	might	.
so	 relig 	 ions 	 	are	the	 fore 	 most 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	an	institution	that	is	 fight 	 ing 	 	for	the	 thing 	 s 	 	of	the	mind	.
now	we	may	not	agree	with	what	 relig 	 ions 	 	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	teach	us	,	but	we	can	admire	the	 institution 	 al 	 	way	in	which	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
 book 	 s 	 	 al 	 one 	 	,	 book 	 s 	 	written	by	lone	 individual 	 s 	 	,	are	not	going	to	change	 any 	 thing 	 	.
we	need	to	group	together	.
if	you	want	to	change	the	world	,	you	have	to	group	together	,	you	have	to	be	 collabor 	 ative 	 	.
and	that	's	what	 relig 	 ions 	 	do	.
they	are	 multi 	 national 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	say	,	they	are	 brand 	 ed 	 	,	they	have	a	clear	 ident 	 ity 	 	,	so	they	do	n't	get	lost	in	a	 bus 	 y 	 	world	.
that	's	 some 	 thing 	 	we	can	learn	from	.
i	want	to	conclude	.
 re 	 ally 	 	what	i	want	to	say	is	for	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	who	are	 oper 	 ating 	 	in	a	range	of	different	 field 	 s 	 	,	there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	to	learn	from	the	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 relig 	 ion 	 	--	even	if	you	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	any	of	it	.
if	you	're	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 any 	 thing 	 	that	's	 commun 	 al 	 	,	that	 involve 	 s 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	people	 get 	 ting 	 	together	,	there	are	 thing 	 s 	 	for	you	in	 relig 	 ion 	 	.
if	you	're	 involve 	 d 	 	,	say	,	in	a	travel	industry	in	any	way	,	look	at	 pil 	 grim 	 age 	 	.
look	 ver 	 y 	 	 close 	 ly 	 	at	 pil 	 grim 	 age 	 	.
we	have	n't	 beg 	 un 	 	to	scratch	the	surface	of	what	travel	could	be	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	n't	 look 	 ed 	 	at	what	 relig 	 ions 	 	do	with	travel	.
if	you	're	in	the	art	world	,	look	at	the	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	what	 relig 	 ions 	 	are	 do 	 ing 	 	with	art	.
and	if	you	're	an	 educ 	 ator 	 	in	any	way	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	look	at	how	 relig 	 ions 	 	are	 spread 	 ing 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	.
you	may	not	agree	with	the	 idea 	 s 	 	,	but	my	 good 	 ness 	 	,	they	're	 high 	 ly 	 	effective	 mechan 	 ism 	 s 	 	for	 do 	 ing 	 	so	.
so	 re 	 ally 	 	my	 con 	 clud 	 ing 	 	point	is	you	may	not	agree	with	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	but	at	the	end	of	the	day	,	 relig 	 ions 	 	are	so	subtle	,	so	 complic 	 ated 	 	,	so	intelligent	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	that	they	're	not	fit	to	be	 abandon 	 ed 	 	to	the	religious	 al 	 one 	 	;	they	're	for	all	of	us	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
chris	anderson	:	now	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 courage 	 ous 	 	talk	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	kind	of	setting	up	 your 	 self 	 	in	some	ways	to	be	 ridicul 	 ed 	 	in	some	 quarter 	 s 	 	.
ab	:	you	can	get	shot	by	both	 side 	 s 	 	.
you	can	get	shot	by	the	hard	-	headed	 atheist 	 s 	 	,	and	you	can	get	shot	by	 t 	 hose 	 	who	fully	 believ 	 e 	 	.
ca	:	 in 	 coming 	 	 mis 	 s 	 ile 	 s 	 	from	north	oxford	at	any	moment	.
ab	:	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	.
ca	:	but	you	left	out	one	 a 	 spect 	 	of	 relig 	 ion 	 	that	a	lot	of	people	might	say	your	agenda	could	borrow	from	,	which	is	 th 	 is 	 	sense	--	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	to	 any 	 one 	 	who	's	religious	--	of	spiritual	experience	,	of	some	kind	of	 connect 	 ion 	 	with	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	 big 	 ger 	 	than	you	are	.
is	there	any	room	for	that	experience	in	 a 	 theism 	 	2.0	?
ab	:	 absolute 	 ly 	 	.	i	,	like	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	,	meet	people	who	say	 thing 	 s 	 	like	,	``	but	is	n't	there	 some 	 thing 	 	 big 	 ger 	 	than	us	,	 some 	 thing 	 	else	?	``	and	i	say	,	``	of	course	.	``	and	they	say	,	``	so	are	n't	you	sort	of	religious	?	``	and	i	go	,	``	no.	``	why	 do 	 es 	 	that	sense	of	 myster 	 y 	 	,	that	sense	of	the	 dizzy 	 ing 	 	scale	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	need	to	be	 accompani 	 ed 	 	by	a	 mystic 	 al 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	?
science	and	just	 observ 	 ation 	 	 give 	 s 	 	us	that	 feel 	 ing 	 	 with 	 out 	 	it	,	so	i	do	n't	feel	the	need	.
the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	large	and	we	are	 tin 	 y 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	the	need	for	further	religious	 super 	 structure 	 	.
so	one	can	have	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	spiritual	 moment 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	belief	in	the	spirit	.
ca	:	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	let	me	just	ask	a	question	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	people	here	would	say	that	 relig 	 ion 	 	is	 import 	 ant 	 	to	them	?
is	there	an	 equi 	 valent 	 	process	by	which	there	's	a	sort	of	bridge	between	what	you	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	and	what	you	would	say	to	them	?
ab	:	i	would	say	that	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 gap 	 s 	 	in	secular	life	and	these	can	be	 plug 	 ged 	 	.
it	's	not	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	try	to	suggest	,	it	's	not	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	either	you	have	 relig 	 ion 	 	and	then	you	have	to	accept	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	,	or	you	do	n't	have	 relig 	 ion 	 	and	then	you	're	cut	off	from	all	these	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 thing 	 s 	 	.
it	's	so	 s 	 ad 	 	that	we	 constant 	 ly 	 	say	,	``	i	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	so	i	ca	n't	have	community	,	so	i	'm	cut	off	from	 moral 	 ity 	 	,	so	i	ca	n't	go	on	a	 pil 	 grim 	 age 	 	.	``	one	 want 	 s 	 	to	say	,	``	 non 	 sense 	 	.	why	not	?	``	and	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	the	spirit	of	my	talk	.
there	's	so	much	we	can	absorb	.
 a 	 theism 	 	should	n't	cut	 it 	 self 	 	off	from	the	rich	 source 	 s 	 	of	 relig 	 ion 	 	.
ca	:	it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	that	there	's	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	people	in	the	ted	community	who	are	 atheist 	 s 	 	.
but	 prob 	 ably 	 	most	people	in	the	community	 certain 	 ly 	 	do	n't	think	that	 relig 	 ion 	 	is	going	away	any	time	soon	and	want	to	find	the	language	to	have	a	 construct 	 ive 	 	 dial 	 ogue 	 	and	to	feel	like	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	talk	to	each	other	and	at	 l 	 east 	 	share	some	 thing 	 s 	 	in	common	.
are	we	 fool 	 ish 	 	to	be	 optimist 	 ic 	 	about	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	a	world	where	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 relig 	 ion 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	the	great	 r 	 ally 	 ing 	 	cry	of	divide	and	war	,	that	there	could	be	 brid 	 ging 	 	?
ab	:	no	,	we	need	to	be	polite	about	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	.
politeness	is	a	much	-	 overlook 	 ed 	 	virtue	.
it	's	 s 	 een 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 hypo 	 cri 	 s 	 y 	 	.
but	we	need	to	get	to	a	stage	when	you	're	an	atheist	and	 some 	 one 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	well	you	know	,	i	did	pray	the	other	day	,	``	you	 polite 	 ly 	 	 ignor 	 e 	 	it	.
you	move	on	.
 be 	 cause 	 	you	've	 agree 	 d 	 	on	90	percent	of	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	have	a	 share 	 d 	 	view	on	so	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	you	 polite 	 ly 	 	differ	.
and	i	think	that	's	what	the	religious	 war 	 s 	 	of	late	have	 ignor 	 ed 	 	.
they	've	 ignor 	 ed 	 	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	 harmon 	 ious 	 	 disagree 	 ment 	 	.
ca	:	and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	new	thing	that	you	're	 pro 	 posing 	 	that	's	not	a	 relig 	 ion 	 	but	 some 	 thing 	 	else	,	 do 	 es 	 	it	need	a	 lead 	 er 	 	,	and	are	you	 volunteer 	 ing 	 	to	be	the	 pop 	 e 	 	?
ab	:	well	,	one	thing	that	we	're	all	 ver 	 y 	 	suspicious	of	is	individual	 lead 	 ers 	 	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	need	it	.
what	i	've	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	lay	out	is	a	 frame 	 work 	 	and	i	'm	 hop 	 ing 	 	that	people	can	just	fill	it	in	.
i	've	 sketch 	 ed 	 	a	sort	of	broad	 frame 	 work 	 	.
but	 where 	 ver 	 	you	are	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	say	,	if	you	're	in	the	travel	industry	,	do	that	travel	bit	.
if	you	're	in	the	 commun 	 al 	 	industry	,	look	at	 relig 	 ion 	 	and	do	the	 commun 	 al 	 	bit	.
so	it	's	a	wiki	project	.
