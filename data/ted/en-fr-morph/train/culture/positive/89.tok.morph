i	 special 	 ize 	 	in	 drag 	 ging 	 	heavy	 thing 	 s 	 	around	cold	 place 	 s 	 	.
on	may	11th	last	year	,	i	stood	 al 	 one 	 	at	the	north	 geo 	 graphic 	 	pole	.
i	was	the	 on 	 ly 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 	in	an	area	one	-	and	-	a	-	half	 time 	 s 	 	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	america	,

more	than	2,000	people	have	 climb 	 ed 	 	everest	.
12	people	have	stood	on	the	moon	.
 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	me	,	 on 	 ly 	 	four	people	have	 ski 	 ed 	 	 s 	 olo 	 	to	the	north	pole	.
and	i	think	the	reason	for	that	--	--	thank	you	--	i	think	the	reason	for	that	is	that	it	's	--	it	's	--	well	,	it	's	 a 	 s 	 	chris	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 bon 	 ker 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	journey	that	is	right	at	the	limit	of	human	 cap 	 ability 	 	.
i	 ski 	 ed 	 	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	31	 marathon 	 s 	 	back	to	back	.	800	 mile 	 s 	 	in	10	 week 	 s 	 	.
and	i	was	 drag 	 ging 	 	all	the	food	i	 need 	 ed 	 	,	the	 suppli 	 es 	 	,	the	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	,	 sleep 	 ing 	 	bag	,	one	change	of	 under 	 wear 	 	--	 every 	 thing 	 	i	 need 	 ed 	 	for	 near 	 ly 	 	three	 month 	 s 	 	.
what	we	're	going	to	try	and	do	 to 	 day 	 	,	in	the	16	and	a	bit	 minute 	 s 	 	i	've	got	left	,	is	to	try	and	answer	three	 question 	 s 	 	.	the	first	one	is	,	why	?
the	second	one	is	,	how	do	you	go	to	the	loo	at	minus	40	?
``	ben	,	i	've	read	 some 	 where 	 	that	at	minus	40	,	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	skin	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 frost 	 bitten 	 	in	less	than	a	minute	,	so	how	do	you	answer	the	call	of	nature	?	``
i	do	n't	want	to	answer	these	now	.	i	'll	come	on	to	them	at	the	end	.
third	one	:	how	do	you	top	that	?	what	's	next	?
it	all	 start 	 ed 	 	back	in	2001	.
my	first	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 	was	with	a	guy	 call 	 ed 	 	pen	hadow	--	 enormous 	 ly 	 	 experience 	 d 	 	chap	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	like	my	polar	 apprentice 	 ship 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	ski	from	 th 	 is 	 	group	of	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	up	here	,	severnaya	zemlya	,	to	the	north	pole	.
and	the	thing	that	 fascinate 	 s 	 	me	about	the	north	pole	,	 geo 	 graphic 	 	north	pole	,	is	that	it	's	 s 	 lap 	 	bang	in	the	middle	of	the	sea	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	about	 a 	 s 	 	good	 a 	 s 	 	 map 	 s 	 	get	,	and	to	reach	it	you	've	got	to	ski	 liter 	 ally 	 	over	the	 froze 	 n 	 	crust	,	the	 float 	 ing 	 	skin	of	ice	on	the	artic	ocean	.
i	'd	spoken	to	all	the	 expert 	 s 	 	.
i	'd	read	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 book 	 s 	 	.	i	 stud 	 ied 	 	 map 	 s 	 	and	 chart 	 s 	 	.
but	i	 real 	 ized 	 	on	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	of	day	one	that	i	had	no	idea	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	i	'd	let	 my 	 self 	 	in	for	.
i	was	23	 year 	 s 	 	old	.	no	one	my	age	had	 attempt 	 ed 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,
and	 pre 	 tty 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	 al 	 most 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	that	could	have	gone	wrong	did	go	wrong	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 attack 	 ed 	 	by	a	polar	bear	on	day	two	.
i	had	 frost 	 bite 	 	in	my	left	big	 to 	 e 	 	.
we	 start 	 ed 	 	running	 ver 	 y 	 	low	on	food	.	we	 we 	 re 	 	both	 pre 	 tty 	 	 hung 	 ry 	 	,	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	weight	.
some	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 usual 	 	weather	 condition 	 s 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	ice	 condition 	 s 	 	.
we	had	 decide 	 d 	 ly 	 	low	-	tech	 communication 	 s 	 	.
we	could	n't	afford	a	satellite	phone	,	so	we	had	hf	radio	.
you	can	see	two	ski	 pole 	 s 	 	 stick 	 ing 	 	out	of	the	roof	of	the	tent	.
there	's	a	wire	 dan 	 gling 	 	down	either	side	.
that	was	our	hf	radio	antenna	.
we	had	less	than	two	 hour 	 s 	 	two	-	way	communication	with	the	 out 	 side 	 	world	in	two	 month 	 s 	 	.
 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	we	ran	out	of	time	.
we	'd	 ski 	 ed 	 	400	 mile 	 s 	 	.	we	 we 	 re 	 	just	over	200	 mile 	 s 	 	left	to	go	to	the	pole	,	and	we	'd	run	out	of	time	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	too	late	 in 	 to 	 	the	summer	;	the	ice	was	 start 	 ing 	 	to	melt	;
we	spoke	to	the	russian	helicopter	 pilot 	 s 	 	on	the	radio	,	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	look	 boy 	 s 	 	,	you	've	run	out	of	time	.
we	've	got	to	pick	you	up	.	``
and	i	felt	that	i	had	 fail 	 ed 	 	,	 whole 	 hearted 	 ly 	 	.
i	was	a	failure	.
the	one	goal	,	the	one	dream	i	'd	had	for	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	i	could	remember	--	i	had	n't	even	come	close	.
and	 ski 	 ing 	 	 a 	 long 	 	that	first	trip	,	i	had	two	 imagin 	 ary 	 	video	 clip 	 s 	 	that	i	'd	 re 	 play 	 	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	in	my	mind	when	the	going	got	tough	,	just	to	keep	my	 motiv 	 ation 	 	going	.
the	first	one	was	 reach 	 ing 	 	the	pole	 it 	 self 	 	.
i	could	see	 vivi 	 d 	 ly 	 	,	i	suppose	,	 be 	 ing 	 	 film 	 ed 	 	out	of	the	door	of	a	helicopter	,	there	was	,	kind	of	,	rock	music	 play 	 ing 	 	in	the	 back 	 ground 	 	,	and	i	had	a	ski	pole	with	a	 un 	 ion 	 	jack	,	you	know	,	 fly 	 ing 	 	in	the	wind	.
i	could	see	 my 	 self 	 	 stick 	 ing 	 	the	flag	in	a	pole	,	you	know	--
ah	,	 glor 	 ious 	 	moment	--	the	music	kind	of	 reach 	 ing 	 	a	crescendo	.
the	second	video	clip	that	i	 imagin 	 ed 	 	was	 get 	 ting 	 	back	to	heathrow	 air 	 port 	 	,
and	i	could	see	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 vivi 	 d 	 ly 	 	,	the	camera	 flash 	 bulb 	 s 	 	going	off	,	the	 papa 	 razzi 	 	,	the	 auto 	 graph 	 	 hunter 	 s 	 	,	the	book	 agent 	 s 	 	coming	to	sign	me	up	for	a	deal	.
and	of	course	,	 n 	 either 	 	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
we	did	n't	get	to	the	pole	,	and	we	did	n't	have	any	money	to	pay	 any 	 one 	 	to	do	the	pr	,	so	no	one	had	heard	of	 th 	 is 	 	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 	.
and	i	got	back	to	heathrow	.	my	mum	was	there	;	my	brother	was	there	;	my	 grand 	 dad 	 	was	there	--	had	a	little	 un 	 ion 	 	jack	--
--	and	that	was	about	it	.	i	went	back	to	live	with	my	mum	.
i	was	 physical 	 ly 	 	 exhaust 	 ed 	 	,	 ment 	 ally 	 	an	absolute	wreck	,	 consider 	 ed 	 	 my 	 self 	 	a	failure	.
in	a	huge	amount	of	debt	 personal 	 ly 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 	,	and	 ly 	 ing 	 	on	my	mum	's	 s 	 of 	 a 	 	,	day	in	day	out	,	 watch 	 ing 	 	 day 	 time 	 	tv	.

and	then	on	to	canada	.
no	one	 ha 	 s 	 	made	a	complete	 cross 	 ing 	 	of	the	 arc 	 tic 	 	ocean	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	.

so	for	some	reason	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	what	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	have	a	crack	at	,	but	i	 k 	 new 	 	that	even	to	stand	a	chance	of	 get 	 ting 	 	home	in	one	piece	,	let	 al 	 one 	 	make	it	 a 	 cross 	 	to	canada	,	i	had	to	take	a	radical	approach	.

at	first	it	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	 sens 	 ible 	 	.	we	flew	british	airways	to	moscow	.

the	next	bit	,	we	'd	 chart 	 er 	 ed 	 	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	 elder 	 ly 	 	russian	plane	to	fly	us	up	to	a	town	 call 	 ed 	 	khatanga	,	which	was	the	sort	of	last	bit	of	 civil 	 ization 	 	.

we	got	to	khatanga	.
i	think	the	joke	is	that	khatanga	is	n't	the	end	of	the	world	,	but	you	can	see	it	from	there	.
it	was	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	an	 over 	 night 	 	stay	.	we	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 tuck 	 	there	for	10	 day 	 s 	 	.
there	was	a	kind	of	vodka	-	 fuel 	 ed 	 	pay	 disput 	 e 	 	between	the	helicopter	 pilot 	 s 	 	and	the	people	that	owned	the	helicopter	,	so	we	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 tuck 	 	.	we	could	n't	move	.
 final 	 ly 	 	,	 morn 	 ing 	 	of	day	11	,	we	got	the	all	-	clear	,	 load 	 ed 	 	up	the	 helicopter 	 s 	 	--	two	 helicopter 	 s 	 	 fly 	 ing 	 	in	tandem	--	 drop 	 ped 	 	me	off	at	the	edge	of	the	pack	ice	.
we	had	a	 fr 	 antic 	 	sort	of	45	 minute 	 s 	 	of	 film 	 ing 	 	,	 photograph 	 y 	 	;	while	the	helicopter	was	still	there	,
i	did	an	interview	on	the	satellite	phone	;	and	then	 every 	 one 	 	else	 climb 	 ed 	 	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	helicopter	,	wham	,	the	door	closed	,	and	i	was	 al 	 one 	 	.
and	i	do	n't	know	if	 word 	 s 	 	will	ever	 quit 	 e 	 	do	that	moment	justice	.
all	i	could	think	about	was	running	back	up	to	the	door	,	 bang 	 ing 	 	on	the	door	,	and	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	look	 guy 	 s 	 	,	i	have	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	thought	 th 	 is 	 	through	.	``
to	make	 thing 	 s 	 	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	you	can	just	see	the	white	dot	up	at	the	top	right	hand	side	of	the	screen	;	that	's	a	full	moon	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	'd	 be 	 en 	 	held	up	in	russia	,	of	course	,	the	full	moon	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	the	highest	and	 low 	 est 	 	 tide 	 s 	 	;
when	you	're	 stand 	 ing 	 	on	the	 froze 	 n 	 	surface	of	the	sea	,	high	and	low	 tide 	 s 	 	 general 	 ly 	 	mean	that	 interest 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	are	going	to	happen	--	the	ice	is	going	to	start	moving	around	a	bit	.
i	was	,	you	can	see	there	,	 pull 	 ing 	 	two	 s 	 ledge 	 s 	 	.	grand	total	in	all	,	95	 day 	 s 	 	of	food	and	fuel	,
180	 kilo 	 s 	 	--	that	's	 al 	 most 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	400	 pound 	 s 	 	.
when	the	ice	was	flat	or	 flat 	 t 	 ish 	 	,	i	could	just	about	pull	both	.
when	the	ice	was	n't	flat	,	i	did	n't	have	a	hope	in	hell	.
i	had	to	pull	one	,	 leav 	 e 	 	it	,	and	go	back	and	get	the	other	one	.
 liter 	 ally 	 	 s 	 cram 	 bling 	 	through	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	pressure	ice	--	the	ice	had	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 mash 	 ed 	 	up	under	the	pressure	of	the	 current 	 s 	 	of	the	ocean	,	the	wind	and	the	 tide 	 s 	 	.
nasa	 de 	 scribed 	 	the	ice	 condition 	 s 	 	last	year	 a 	 s 	 	the	worst	since	 record 	 s 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	.
and	it	's	 al 	 ways 	 	 drift 	 ing 	 	.	the	pack	ice	is	 al 	 ways 	 	 drift 	 ing 	 	.
i	was	 ski 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 head 	 wind 	 s 	 	for	nine	out	of	the	10	 week 	 s 	 	i	was	 al 	 one 	 	last	year	,	and	i	was	 drift 	 ing 	 	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	most	of	the	time	.
my	record	was	minus	2.5	 mile 	 s 	 	.
i	got	up	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	took	the	tent	down	,	 ski 	 ed 	 	north	for	seven	-	and	-	a	-	half	 hour 	 s 	 	,	put	the	tent	up	,	and	i	was	two	and	a	half	 mile 	 s 	 	further	back	than	when	i	'd	 start 	 ed 	 	.
i	 liter 	 ally 	 	could	n't	keep	up	with	the	drift	of	the	ice	.
:	so	it	's	day	22	.
i	'm	 ly 	 ing 	 	in	the	tent	,	 get 	 ting 	 	ready	to	go	.
the	weather	is	just	 app 	 all 	 ing 	 	--	oh	,	 drift 	 ed 	 	back	about	five	 mile 	 s 	 	in	the	last	--	last	night	.
 lat 	 er 	 	in	the	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 	,	the	problem	was	no	 long 	 er 	 	the	ice	.
it	was	a	lack	of	ice	--	open	water	.
i	 k 	 new 	 	 th 	 is 	 	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	.	i	 k 	 new 	 	the	artic	was	 warm 	 ing 	 	.
i	 k 	 new 	 	there	was	more	open	water	.	and	i	had	a	secret	weapon	up	my	sleeve	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	my	little	bit	of	bio	-	mimicry	.
polar	 bear 	 s 	 	on	the	artic	ocean	move	in	dead	straight	lines	.
if	they	come	to	water	,	they	'll	climb	in	,	swim	 a 	 cross 	 	it	.
so	we	had	a	dry	suit	 develop 	 ed 	 	--	i	 work 	 ed 	 	with	a	team	in	norway	--	based	on	a	sort	of	 surviv 	 al 	 	suit	--	i	suppose	,	that	helicopter	 pilot 	 s 	 	would	wear	--	that	i	could	climb	 in 	 to 	 	.	it	would	go	on	over	my	 boot 	 s 	 	,	over	my	 mitt 	 en 	 s 	 	,	it	would	pull	up	around	my	face	,	and	seal	 pre 	 tty 	 	 tight 	 ly 	 	around	my	face	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	i	could	ski	over	 ver 	 y 	 	thin	ice	,	and	if	i	fell	through	,	it	was	n't	the	end	of	the	world	.
it	 al 	 so 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	,	if	the	worst	came	to	the	worst	,	i	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	jump	in	and	swim	 a 	 cross 	 	and	drag	the	 s 	 ledge 	 	over	after	me	.
some	 pre 	 tty 	 	radical	technology	,	a	radical	approach	--	but	it	 work 	 ed 	 	 perfect 	 ly 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	thing	we	did	last	year	was	with	 communication 	 s 	 	technology	.
in	1912	,	shackleton	's	 endur 	 ance 	 	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 	--	there	was	--	one	of	his	crew	,	a	guy	 call 	 ed 	 	thomas	orde	-	lees	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	the	 explore 	 rs 	 	of	2012	,	if	there	is	 any 	 thing 	 	left	to	explore	,	will	no	doubt	carry	pocket	 wire 	 less 	 	 tele 	 phone 	 s 	 	fitted	with	 wire 	 less 	 	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	.	``
well	,	orde	-	lees	 guess 	 ed 	 	wrong	by	about	eight	 year 	 s 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	pocket	 wire 	 less 	 	 tele 	 phone 	 	,
 irid 	 ium 	 	satellite	phone	.
the	 wire 	 less 	 	 tele 	 scope 	 	was	a	digital	camera	i	had	 tuck 	 ed 	 	in	my	pocket	.
and	every	single	day	of	the	72	 day 	 s 	 	i	was	 al 	 one 	 	on	the	ice	,	i	was	 b 	 logging 	 	live	from	my	tent	,	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	back	a	little	 di 	 ary 	 	piece	,	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	back	information	on	the	distance	i	'd	 cover 	 ed 	 	--	the	ice	 condition 	 s 	 	,	the	temperature	--	and	a	 dai 	 ly 	 	photo	.
remember	,	2001	,	we	had	less	than	two	 hour 	 s 	 	radio	contact	with	the	 out 	 side 	 	world	.
last	year	,	 b 	 logging 	 	live	from	an	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	 de 	 scribed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	10	 time 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	 a 	 s 	 	everest	.
it	was	n't	all	high	-	tech	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 navig 	 ating 	 	in	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	a	 white 	 out 	 	.
when	you	get	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 mis 	 t 	 	,	low	cloud	,	the	wind	 start 	 s 	 	 blow 	 ing 	 	the	snow	up	.
you	ca	n't	see	an	awful	lot	.	you	can	just	see	,	there	's	a	yellow	ribbon	 ti 	 ed 	 	to	one	of	my	ski	 pole 	 s 	 	.
i	'd	 navig 	 ate 	 	using	the	direction	of	the	wind	.
so	,	kind	of	a	weird	combination	of	high	-	tech	and	low	-	tech	.
i	got	to	the	pole	on	the	11th	of	may	.
it	took	me	68	 day 	 s 	 	to	get	there	from	russia	,	and	there	is	 noth 	 ing 	 	there	.
.
there	is	n't	even	a	pole	at	the	pole	.	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	there	,	 pur 	 e 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	sea	ice	.	it	's	 drift 	 ing 	 	.
stick	a	flag	there	,	 leav 	 e 	 	it	there	,	 pre 	 tty 	 	soon	it	will	drift	off	,	 usual 	 ly 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	canada	or	greenland	.
i	 k 	 new 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	i	was	 expect 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	.
strange	 mix 	 ture 	 	of	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	:	it	was	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	warm	by	 th 	 is 	 	stage	,	a	lot	of	open	water	around	,	and	of	course	,	 el 	 ated 	 	that	i	'd	got	there	under	my	own	 s 	 team 	 	,	but	 start 	 ing 	 	to	 re 	 ally 	 	 real 	 ize 	 	that	my	 chance 	 s 	 	of	making	it	all	the	way	 a 	 cross 	 	to	canada	,	which	was	still	400	 mile 	 s 	 	away	,	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 lim 	 	at	best	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	proof	i	've	got	that	i	was	there	is	a	 blur 	 ry 	 	photo	of	my	gps	,	the	little	satellite	 navig 	 ation 	 	gadget	.
you	can	just	see	--	there	's	a	nine	and	a	string	of	 zero 	 s 	 	here	.
ninety	 degree 	 s 	 	north	--	that	is	 s 	 lap 	 	bang	in	the	north	pole	.
i	took	a	photo	of	that	.	 s 	 at 	 	down	on	my	 s 	 ledge 	 	.	did	a	sort	of	video	 di 	 ary 	 	piece	.
took	a	few	 photo 	 s 	 	.	i	got	my	satellite	phone	out	.
i	 warm 	 ed 	 	the	 batt 	 ery 	 	up	in	my	 arm 	 pit 	 	.
i	 dial 	 ed 	 	three	 number 	 s 	 	.	i	 dial 	 ed 	 	my	mum	.
i	 dial 	 ed 	 	my	girlfriend	.	i	 dial 	 ed 	 	the	ceo	of	my	sponsor	.
and	i	got	three	 voice 	 mail 	 s 	 	.
:	ninety	.
it	's	a	special	 feel 	 ing 	 	.
the	entire	planet	is	 rot 	 ating 	 	 be 	 neath 	 	my	feet	.
the	--	the	whole	world	 under 	 neath 	 	me	.
i	 final 	 ly 	 	got	through	to	my	mum	.	she	was	at	the	queue	of	the	 super 	 market 	 	.
she	 start 	 ed 	 	 cry 	 ing 	 	.	she	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	to	call	her	back	.
i	 ski 	 ed 	 	on	for	a	week	past	the	pole	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	get	 a 	 s 	 	close	to	canada	 a 	 s 	 	i	could	before	 condition 	 s 	 	just	got	too	 danger 	 ous 	 	to	 continu 	 e 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	the	last	day	i	had	on	the	ice	.
when	i	spoke	to	the	--	my	project	management	team	,	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	look	,	ben	,	 condition 	 s 	 	are	 get 	 ting 	 	too	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
there	are	huge	 area 	 s 	 	of	open	water	just	south	of	your	position	.
we	'd	like	to	pick	you	up	.
ben	,	could	you	 pleas 	 e 	 	look	for	an	 air 	 strip 	 	?	``
 th 	 is 	 	was	the	view	 out 	 side 	 	my	tent	when	i	had	 th 	 is 	 	 fate 	 ful 	 	phone	call	.
i	'd	never	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	build	an	 air 	 strip 	 	before	.	tony	,	the	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 	 manage 	 r 	 	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	look	ben	,	you	've	got	to	find	500	 meter 	 s 	 	of	flat	,	thick	safe	ice	.	``
the	 on 	 ly 	 	bit	of	ice	i	could	find	--	it	took	me	36	 hour 	 s 	 	of	 ski 	 ing 	 	around	 try 	 ing 	 	to	find	an	 air 	 strip 	 	--	was	 exact 	 ly 	 	473	 meter 	 s 	 	.	i	could	measure	it	with	my	 ski 	 s 	 	.
i	did	n't	tell	tony	that	.	i	did	n't	tell	the	 pilot 	 s 	 	that	.
i	thought	,	it	'll	have	to	do	.
:	oh	,	oh	,	oh	,	oh	,	oh	,	oh	.
it	just	about	 work 	 ed 	 	.	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	 dramat 	 ic 	 	 land 	 ing 	 	--	the	plane	 actual 	 ly 	 	 pass 	 ed 	 	over	four	 time 	 s 	 	,	and	i	was	a	bit	 worri 	 ed 	 	it	was	n't	going	to	land	at	all	.
the	pilot	,	i	 k 	 new 	 	,	was	 call 	 ed 	 	troy	.	i	was	 expect 	 ing 	 	 some 	 one 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	troy	that	did	 th 	 is 	 	for	a	living	to	be	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	tough	kind	of	guy	.
i	was	 ba 	 wl 	 ing 	 	my	 eye 	 s 	 	out	by	the	time	the	plane	 land 	 ed 	 	--	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	 emotion 	 al 	 	moment	.
so	i	thought	,	i	've	got	to	compose	 my 	 self 	 	for	troy	.
i	'm	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	the	 rough 	 ty 	 	 tough 	 ty 	 	 explore 	 r 	 	type	.

.
the	co	-	pilot	was	a	 lad 	 y 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	monica	.
she	 s 	 at 	 	there	in	a	sort	of	hand	-	knitted	 jump 	 er 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	the	 l 	 east 	 	 ma 	 cho 	 	people	i	've	ever	met	,	but	they	made	my	day	.
troy	was	 smok 	 ing 	 	a	 cigar 	 ette 	 	on	the	ice	;	we	took	a	few	 photo 	 s 	 	.	he
 climb 	 ed 	 	up	the	 lad 	 der 	 	.	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	just	--	just	get	in	the	back	.	``
he	threw	his	 cigar 	 ette 	 	out	 a 	 s 	 	he	got	on	the	front	,	and	i	 climb 	 ed 	 	in	the	back	.
 taxi 	 ed 	 	up	and	down	the	 run 	 way 	 	a	few	 time 	 s 	 	,	just	to	flatten	it	out	a	bit	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	right	,	i	'm	going	to	--	i	'm	going	to	give	it	a	go	.	``	and	he	--	i	've	now	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	standard	practice	,	but	it	had	me	 worri 	 ed 	 	at	the	time	.
he	put	his	hand	on	the	throttle	.
you	can	see	the	control	for	the	 engine 	 s 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	on	the	roof	of	the	 cock 	 pit 	 	.
it	's	that	little	bar	there	.	he	put	his	hand	on	the	throttle	.
monica	 ver 	 y 	 	 gent 	 ly 	 	put	her	hand	sort	of	on	top	of	his	.
i	thought	,	``	god	,	here	we	go	.	we	're	,	we	're	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	or	 noth 	 ing 	 	.	``
 ramm 	 ed 	 	it	 forward 	 s 	 	.	 bounc 	 ed 	 	down	the	 run 	 way 	 	.	just	took	off	.
one	of	the	 ski 	 s 	 	just	 clip 	 ped 	 	a	pressure	ridge	at	the	end	of	the	 run 	 way 	 	,
 bank 	 ing 	 	.	i	could	see	 in 	 to 	 	the	 cock 	 pit 	 	,	troy	 batt 	 ling 	 	the	 control 	 s 	 	,	and	he	just	took	one	hand	off	,	 reach 	 ed 	 	back	,	 flip 	 ped 	 	a	 s 	 witch 	 	on	the	roof	of	the	 cock 	 pit 	 	,	and	it	was	the	``	 fast 	 en 	 	seat	belt	``	sign	you	can	see	on	the	wall	.
and	 on 	 ly 	 	from	the	air	did	i	see	the	big	picture	.
of	course	,	when	you	're	on	the	ice	,	you	 on 	 ly 	 	ever	see	one	obstacle	at	a	time	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	a	pressure	ridge	or	there	's	a	bit	of	water	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	why	i	did	n't	get	 in 	 to 	 	trouble	about	the	length	of	my	 air 	 strip 	 	.
i	mean	,	it	 re 	 ally 	 	was	 start 	 ing 	 	to	break	up	.
why	?	i	'm	not	an	 explore 	 r 	 	in	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	sense	.
i	'm	not	 ski 	 ing 	 	 a 	 long 	 	 draw 	 ing 	 	 map 	 s 	 	;	 every 	 one 	 	 know 	 s 	 	where	the	north	pole	is	.
at	the	south	pole	there	's	a	big	scientific	base	.	there	's	an	 air 	 strip 	 	.
there	's	a	cafe	and	there	's	a	tourist	shop	.
for	me	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	about	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	human	 limit 	 s 	 	,	about	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	the	 limit 	 s 	 	of	physiology	,	of	 psycho 	 logy 	 	and	of	technology	.	they	're	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 excit 	 e 	 	me	.
and	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	about	potential	,	on	a	personal	level	.
 th 	 is 	 	,	for	me	,	is	a	chance	to	explore	the	 limit 	 s 	 	--	 re 	 ally 	 	push	the	 limit 	 s 	 	of	my	own	potential	,	see	how	far	they	stretch	.
and	on	a	 wide 	 r 	 	scale	,	it	 amaze 	 s 	 	me	how	people	go	through	life	just	 scratch 	 ing 	 	the	surface	of	 the 	 ir 	 	potential	,	just	 do 	 ing 	 	three	or	four	or	five	percent	of	what	they	're	 tru 	 ly 	 	 cap 	 able 	 	of	.	so	,	on	a	 wide 	 r 	 	scale	,	i	hope	that	 th 	 is 	 	journey	was	a	chance	to	inspire	other	people	to	think	about	what	they	want	to	do	with	 the 	 ir 	 	potential	,	and	what	they	want	to	do	with	the	 tin 	 y 	 	amount	of	time	we	each	have	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	.
that	's	 a 	 s 	 	close	 a 	 s 	 	i	can	come	to	 summ 	 ing 	 	that	up	.
the	next	question	is	,	how	do	you	answer	the	call	of	nature	at	minus	40	?
the	answer	,	of	course	,	to	which	is	a	trade	secret	--	and	the	last	question	,	what	's	next	?	 a 	 s 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	possible	,	if	i	have	a	minute	left	at	the	end	,	i	'll	go	 in 	 to 	 	more	detail	.
what	's	next	:
antarctica	.
it	's	the	 cold 	 est 	 	,	highest	,	 wind 	 iest 	 	and	 dr 	 iest 	 	continent	on	earth	.
late	1911	,	early	1912	,	there	was	a	race	to	be	the	first
to	the	south	pole	:	the	heart	of	the	antarctic	continent	.
if	you	include	the	 coast 	 al 	 	ice	 shelv 	 es 	 	,	you	can	see	that	the	ross	ice	shelf	--	it	's	the	big	one	down	here	--	the	ross	ice	shelf	is	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	france	.
antarctica	,	if	you	include	the	ice	 shelv 	 es 	 	,	is	twice	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	australia	--	it	's	a	big	place	.
and	there	's	a	race	to	get	to	the	pole	between	amundsen	,	the	norwegian	--	amundsen	had	dog	 s 	 led 	 s 	 	and	 husk 	 ies 	 	--	and	scott	,	the	british	guy	,	 cap 	 tain 	 	scott	.
scott	had	sort	of	 p 	 onies 	 	and	some	 tract 	 ors 	 	and	a	few	 dog 	 s 	 	,	all	of	which	went	wrong	,
and	scott	and	his	team	of	four	people	 end 	 ed 	 	up	on	foot	.
they	got	to	the	pole	late	january	1912	to	find	a	norwegian	flag	 al 	 ready 	 	there	.
there	was	a	tent	,	a	letter	to	the	norwegian	king	.
and	they	 turn 	 ed 	 	around	,	headed	back	to	the	coast	,	and	all	five	of	them	 di 	 ed 	 	on	the	return	journey	.
since	then	,	no	one	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	 ski 	 ed 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	was	93	 year 	 s 	 	ago	--	since	then	,	no	one	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	 ski 	 ed 	 	from	the	coast	of	antarctica	to	the	pole	and	back	.
every	south	pole	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 	you	may	have	heard	about	is	either	 flow 	 n 	 	out	from	the	pole	or	 ha 	 s 	 	used	 vehicle 	 s 	 	or	 dog 	 s 	 	or	 kite 	 s 	 	to	do	some	kind	of	 cross 	 ing 	 	--	no	one	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	made	a	return	journey	.	so	that	's	the	plan	.
two	of	us	are	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
that	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	it	.	one	final	thought	before	i	get	to	the	toilet	bit	,	is	--	is	,	i	have	a	--	and	i	 me 	 ant 	 	to	 s 	 can 	 	 th 	 is 	 	and	i	've	 for 	 gotten 	 	--	but	i	have	a	--	i	have	a	school	report	.	i	was	13	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	and	it	's	 frame 	 d 	 	above	my	desk	at	home	.	it	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	ben	 lack 	 s 	 	sufficient	 im 	 pet 	 us 	 	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	 worth 	 while 	 	.	``
i	think	if	i	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	,	it	's	 th 	 is 	 	:	that	no	one	else	is	the	 author 	 ity 	 	on	your	potential	.
you	're	the	 on 	 ly 	 	person	that	 decide 	 s 	 	how	far	you	go	and	what	you	're	 cap 	 able 	 	of	.
 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	that	's	my	story	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
