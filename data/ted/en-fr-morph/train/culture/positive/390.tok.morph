 th 	 is 	 	was	in	an	area	 call 	 ed 	 	wellawatta	,	a	prime	 resident 	 ial 	 	area	in	colombo	.
we	stood	on	the	 rail 	 road 	 	 track 	 s 	 	that	ran	between	my	friend	's	house	and	the	beach	.
the	 track 	 s 	 	are	 elev 	 ated 	 	about	eight	feet	from	the	 water 	 line 	 	 normal 	 ly 	 	,	but	at	that	point	the	water	had	 reced 	 ed 	 	to	a	level	three	or	four	feet	 be 	 low 	 	normal	.
i	'd	never	 s 	 een 	 	the	reef	here	before	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	fish	caught	in	rock	 pool 	 s 	 	left	 be 	 hind 	 	by	the	 reced 	 ing 	 	water	.
some	children	 jump 	 ed 	 	down	and	ran	to	the	rock	 pool 	 s 	 	with	 bag 	 s 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	catch	fish	.
no	one	 real 	 ized 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	bad	idea	.
the	people	on	the	 track 	 s 	 	just	 continu 	 ed 	 	to	watch	them	.
i	 turn 	 ed 	 	around	to	check	on	my	friend	's	house	.
then	 some 	 one 	 	on	the	 track 	 s 	 	 s 	 cream 	 ed 	 	.
before	i	could	turn	around	,	 every 	 one 	 	on	the	 track 	 s 	 	was	 s 	 cream 	 ing 	 	and	running	.
the	water	had	 start 	 ed 	 	coming	back	.	it	was	 foam 	 ing 	 	over	the	reef	.
the	children	 manage 	 d 	 	to	run	back	onto	the	 track 	 s 	 	.
no	one	was	lost	there	.	but	the	water	 continu 	 ed 	 	to	climb	.
in	about	two	 minute 	 s 	 	,	it	had	 reach 	 ed 	 	the	level	of	the	 rail 	 road 	 	 track 	 s 	 	and	was	coming	over	it	.	we	had	run	about	100	 meter 	 s 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	time	.
it	 continu 	 ed 	 	to	rise	.
i	saw	an	old	man	 stand 	 ing 	 	at	his	gate	,	knee	-	deep	in	water	,	 re 	 fusing 	 	to	move	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	he	'd	lived	his	whole	life	there	by	the	beach	,	and	that	he	would	 ra 	 ther 	 	die	there	than	run	.
a	boy	broke	away	from	his	mother	to	run	back	 in 	 to 	 	his	house	to	get	his	dog	,	who	was	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	 af 	 raid 	 	.
an	old	 lad 	 y 	 	,	 cry 	 ing 	 	,	was	carried	out	of	her	house	and	up	the	road	by	her	son	.
the	 s 	 lum 	 	built	on	the	 rail 	 road 	 	reservation	between	the	sea	and	the	 rail 	 road 	 	 track 	 s 	 	was	 complete 	 ly 	 	 s 	 wept 	 	away	.
since	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	high	-	risk	location	,	the	police	had	 war 	 ned 	 	the	 resident 	 s 	 	,	and	no	one	was	there	when	the	water	rose	.
but	they	had	not	had	any	time	to	evacuate	any	 belong 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
for	 hour 	 s 	 	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	the	sea	was	strewn	with	bits	of	wood	for	 mile 	 s 	 	around	--	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	was	from	the	 house 	 s 	 	in	the	 s 	 lum 	 	.
when	the	 water 	 s 	 	 sub 	 sided 	 	,	it	was	 a 	 s 	 	if	it	had	never	 exist 	 ed 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	may	seem	hard	to	 believ 	 e 	 	--	 un 	 less 	 	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	 read 	 ing 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	news	 report 	 s 	 	--	but	in	 man 	 y 	 	 place 	 s 	 	,	after	the	tsunami	,	 village 	 rs 	 	 we 	 re 	 	still	 terr 	 ified 	 	.
when	what	was	a	tranquil	sea	 swallow 	 s 	 	up	people	,	 home 	 s 	 	and	long	-	tail	 boat 	 s 	 	--	 merci 	 lessly 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	 war 	 ning 	 	--	and	no	one	can	tell	you	 any 	 thing 	 	 reli 	 able 	 	about	 whet 	 her 	 	 an 	 other 	 	one	is	coming	,	i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	you	'd	want	to	calm	down	either	.
one	of	the	 scar 	 iest 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	about	the	tsunami	that	i	've	not	 s 	 een 	 	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	is	the	complete	lack	of	information	.
 th 	 is 	 	may	seem	minor	,	but	it	is	 terrify 	 ing 	 	to	hear	rumor	after	rumor	after	rumor	that	 an 	 other 	 	 tid 	 al 	 	wave	,	 big 	 ger 	 	than	the	last	,	will	be	coming	at	 exact 	 ly 	 	1	 p.m 	 . 	 	,	or	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 to 	 night 	 	,	or	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	...
you	do	n't	even	know	if	it	is	safe	to	go	back	down	to	the	water	,	to	catch	a	boat	to	the	hospital	.
we	think	that	phi	phi	hospital	was	 destroy 	 ed 	 	.
we	think	 th 	 is 	 	boat	is	going	to	phuket	hospital	,	but	if	it	's	too	 danger 	 ous 	 	to	land	at	 it 	 s 	 	 pi 	 er 	 	,	then	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	it	will	go	to	krabi	 in 	 stead 	 	,	which	is	more	 protect 	 ed 	 	.
we	do	n't	think	 an 	 other 	 	wave	is	coming	right	away	.
at	the	phi	phi	hill	resort	,	i	was	 tuck 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	corner	 fur 	 th 	 est 	 	away	from	the	 tele 	 vision 	 	,	but	i	 s 	 trained 	 	to	listen	for	information	.
they	 report 	 ed 	 	that	there	was	an	8.5	 magn 	 itude 	 	 earth 	 quake 	 	in	sumatra	,	which	 trigger 	 ed 	 	the	massive	tsunami	.
 hav 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	news	was	 comfort 	 ing 	 	in	some	small	way	to	understand	what	had	just	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	us	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	the	report	focused	on	what	had	 al 	 ready 	 	 occur 	 red 	 	and	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	no	information	on	what	to	expect	now	.
in	general	,	 every 	 thing 	 	was	 mere 	 ly 	 	 hear 	 say 	 	and	rumor	,	and	not	a	single	person	i	spoke	to	for	over	36	 hour 	 s 	 	 k 	 new 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	with	any	 certain 	 ty 	 	.

in	the	world	of	 blog 	 s 	 	,	there	's	going	to	be	before	the	tsunami	and	after	the	tsunami	,	 be 	 cause 	 	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	wake	of	the	tsunami	was	that	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	 initi 	 ally 	 	--	that	is	,	in	that	first	day	--	there	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	kind	of	 d 	 earth 	 	of	live	 report 	 ing 	 	,	there	was	a	 d 	 earth 	 	of	live	video	and	some	people	 complain 	 ed 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	the	 blog 	 sters 	 	let	us	down	.	``
what	 be 	 came 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	was	that	,	 with 	 in 	 	a	few	 day 	 s 	 	,	the	 out 	 pour 	 ing 	 	of	information	was	immense	,	and	we	got	a	complete	and	 power 	 ful 	 	picture	of	what	had	 happen 	 ed 	 	and	what	you	had	was	a	group	of	 essential 	 ly 	 	 un 	 organize 	 d 	 	,	 un 	 connect 	 ed 	 	 writer 	 s 	 	,	video	 blogger 	 s 	 	,	etc	.	,	who	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	come	up	with	a	 collect 	 ive 	 	portrait	of	a	disaster	that	 g 	 ave 	 	us	a	much	better	sense	of	what	it	was	like	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	there	than	the	 main 	 stream 	 	media	could	give	us	.
and	so	in	some	ways	the	tsunami	can	be	 s 	 een 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	sort	of	 semi 	 nal 	 	moment	,	a	moment	in	which	the	 blog 	 o 	 sphere 	 	came	,	to	a	certain	degree	,	of	age	.
now	,	i	'm	going	to	move	now	from	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	--	the	 sub 	 lime 	 	in	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	sense	of	the	word	,	that	is	to	say	,	awe	-	inspiring	,	 terrify 	 ing 	 	--	to	the	 some 	 what 	 	more	mundane	.
 be 	 cause 	 	when	we	think	about	 blog 	 s 	 	,	i	think	for	most	of	us	who	are	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	them	,	we	're	 prim 	 arily 	 	 concern 	 ed 	 	with	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 politic 	 s 	 	,	technology	,	etc	.	and	i	want	to	ask	three	 question 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	talk	,	in	the	10	 minute 	 s 	 	that	remain	,	about	the	 blog 	 o 	 sphere 	 	.
the	first	one	is	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	it	tell	us	about	our	 idea 	 s 	 	,	about	what	 motiv 	 ates 	 	people	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	?
the	second	is	,	do	 blog 	 s 	 	 genuine 	 ly 	 	have	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	 access 	 ing 	 	a	kind	of	 collect 	 ive 	 	 intellig 	 ence 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 previous 	 ly 	 	 remain 	 ed 	 	,	for	the	most	part	,	 un 	 ta 	 pped 	 	?
and	then	the	third	part	is	,	what	are	the	potential	 problem 	 s 	 	,	or	the	dark	side	of	 blog 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	know	them	?
ok	,	the	first	question	:	what	do	they	tell	us	about	why	people	do	 thing 	 s 	 	?
one	of	the	 fasci 	 nating 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	about	the	 blog 	 o 	 sphere 	 	 specific 	 ally 	 	,	and	,	of	course	,	the	 inter 	 net 	 	more	 general 	 ly 	 	--	and	it	's	going	to	seem	like	a	 ver 	 y 	 	obvious	point	,	but	i	think	it	is	an	 import 	 ant 	 	one	to	think	about	--	is	that	the	people	who	are	generating	these	enormous	 re 	 am 	 s 	 	of	content	every	day	,	who	are	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	enormous	 amount 	 s 	 	of	time	 organ 	 izing 	 	,	 link 	 ing 	 	,	 comment 	 ing 	 	on	the	 sub 	 stance 	 	of	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	are	 do 	 ing 	 	so	 prim 	 arily 	 	for	free	.
they	are	not	 get 	 ting 	 	paid	for	it	in	any	way	other	than	in	the	attention	and	,	to	some	 ex 	 tent 	 	,	the	 reputation 	 al 	 	capital	that	they	gain	from	 do 	 ing 	 	a	good	job	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	--	at	 l 	 east 	 	,	to	a	 tradition 	 al 	 	economist	--	 some 	 what 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	account	of	economic	man	would	say	that	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	you	do	 thing 	 s 	 	for	a	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	reward	,	 prim 	 arily 	 	financial	.
but	 in 	 stead 	 	,	what	we	're	 find 	 ing 	 	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	--	and	one	of	the	great	 gen 	 ius 	 es 	 	of	it	--	is	that	people	have	found	a	way	to	work	together	 with 	 out 	 	any	money	 involve 	 d 	 	at	all	.	they	have	come	up	with	,	in	a	sense	,	a	different	method	for	 organ 	 izing 	 	activity	.
the	yale	law	professor	yochai	benkler	,	in	an	essay	 call 	 ed 	 	``	coase	's	penguin	,	``	 talk 	 s 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	open	-	source	model	,	which	we	're	familiar	with	from	linux	,	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 potential 	 ly 	 	 appli 	 cable 	 	in	a	whole	host	of	 situ 	 ations 	 	.
and	,	you	know	,	if	you	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	with	the	tsunami	,	what	you	have	is	 essential 	 ly 	 	a	kind	of	an	 arm 	 y 	 	of	local	 journalist 	 s 	 	,	who	are	producing	enormous	 amount 	 s 	 	of	material	for	no	reason	other	than	to	tell	 the 	 ir 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	.
that	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	idea	,	and	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	.
and	it	's	one	that	 off 	 ers 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 possibil 	 ities 	 	for	 organ 	 izing 	 	a	whole	host	of	 activ 	 ities 	 	down	the	road	.
so	,	i	think	the	first	thing	that	the	 blog 	 o 	 sphere 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	us	is	that	we	need	to	expand	our	idea	of	what	 count 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	rational	,	and	we	need	to	expand	our	simple	 equ 	 ation 	 	of	value	 equal 	 s 	 	money	,	or	,	you	have	to	pay	for	it	to	be	good	,	but	that	in	fact	you	can	end	up	with	 collect 	 ively 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 brilli 	 ant 	 	 product 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	any	money	at	all	changing	 hand 	 s 	 	.
there	are	a	few	 blogger 	 s 	 	--	 some 	 where 	 	 may 	 be 	 	around	20	,	now	--	who	do	,	in	fact	,	make	some	kind	of	money	,	and	a	few	who	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	a	full	-	time	living	out	of	it	,	but	the	vast	 major 	 ity 	 	of	them	are	 do 	 ing 	 	it	 be 	 cause 	 	they	love	it	or	they	love	the	attention	,	or	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	.
so	,	howard	rheingold	 ha 	 s 	 	written	a	lot	about	 th 	 is 	 	and	,	i	think	,	is	writing	about	 th 	 is 	 	more	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	of	voluntary	 co 	 operation 	 	is	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	one	,	and	one	worth	 think 	 ing 	 	about	.
the	second	question	is	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	the	 blog 	 o 	 sphere 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	for	us	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 access 	 ing 	 	 collect 	 ive 	 	 intellig 	 ence 	 	?
you	know	,	 a 	 s 	 	chris	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	,	i	wrote	a	book	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	 wis 	 dom 	 	of	 crowd 	 s 	 	.	``	and	the	 pre 	 mise 	 	of	``	the	 wis 	 dom 	 	of	 crowd 	 s 	 	``	is	that	,	under	the	right	 condition 	 s 	 	,	 group 	 s 	 	can	be	 remark 	 ably 	 	intelligent	.
and	they	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	often	be	 smart 	 er 	 	than	even	the	 smart 	 est 	 	person	 with 	 in 	 	them	.
the	 simpl 	 est 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	if	you	ask	a	group	of	people	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	like	guess	how	 man 	 y 	 	 jelly 	 bean 	 s 	 	are	in	a	jar	.
if	i	had	a	jar	of	 jelly 	 bean 	 s 	 	and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	you	all	to	guess	how	 man 	 y 	 	 jelly 	 bean 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	in	that	jar	,	your	average	guess	would	be	 remark 	 ably 	 	good	.
it	would	be	 some 	 where 	 	 prob 	 ably 	 	 with 	 in 	 	three	and	five	percent	of	the	number	of	 bean 	 s 	 	in	the	jar	,	and	it	would	be	better	than	90	to	95	percent	of	you	.
there	may	be	one	or	two	of	you	who	are	 brilli 	 ant 	 	jelly	bean	 guess 	 ers 	 	,	but	for	the	most	part	the	group	's	guess	would	be	better	than	just	about	all	of	you	.
and	what	's	 fasci 	 nating 	 	is	that	you	can	see	 th 	 is 	 	 phenomen 	 on 	 	at	work	in	 man 	 y 	 	more	 complic 	 ated 	 	 situ 	 ations 	 	.
for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	if	you	look	at	the	 odd 	 s 	 	on	 horse 	 s 	 	at	a	 race 	 track 	 	,	they	predict	 al 	 most 	 	 perfect 	 ly 	 	how	 like 	 ly 	 	a	horse	is	to	win	.
in	a	sense	,	the	group	of	 better 	 s 	 	at	the	 race 	 track 	 	is	 fore 	 cast 	 ing 	 	the	future	,	in	 pro 	 bab 	 il 	 istic 	 	 term 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	if	you	think	about	 some 	 thing 	 	like	google	,	which	 essential 	 ly 	 	is	 re 	 ly 	 ing 	 	on	the	 collect 	 ive 	 	 intellig 	 ence 	 	of	the	web	to	seek	out	 t 	 hose 	 	 s 	 ites 	 	that	have	the	most	 valu 	 able 	 	information	--
we	know	that	google	 do 	 es 	 	an	 exception 	 ally 	 	good	job	of	 do 	 ing 	 	that	,	and	it	 do 	 es 	 	that	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 collect 	 ively 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 dis 	 organize 	 d 	 	thing	we	call	the	``	world	wide	web	``	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 remark 	 able 	 	order	,	or	a	 remark 	 able 	 	 intellig 	 ence 	 	in	it	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	think	,	is	one	of	the	real	 promise 	 s 	 	of	the	 blog 	 o 	 sphere 	 	.
dan	gillmor	--	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	book	``	we	the	media	``	is	 include 	 d 	 	in	the	gift	pack	--	 ha 	 s 	 	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	it	 a 	 s 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	that	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	writer	,	he	's	 recogn 	 ized 	 	that	his	 read 	 ers 	 	know	more	than	he	 do 	 es 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 challeng 	 ing 	 	idea	.	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 challeng 	 ing 	 	idea	to	 main 	 stream 	 	media	.	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 challeng 	 ing 	 	idea	to	 any 	 one 	 	who	 ha 	 s 	 	 invest 	 ed 	 	an	enormous	amount	of	time	and	 expert 	 ise 	 	,	and	who	 ha 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	energy	 invest 	 ed 	 	in	the	 not 	 ion 	 	that	he	or	she	 know 	 s 	 	better	than	 every 	 one 	 	else	.
but	what	the	 blog 	 o 	 sphere 	 	 off 	 ers 	 	is	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	 get 	 ting 	 	at	the	kind	of	 collect 	 ive 	 	,	 distribut 	 ive 	 	 intellig 	 ence 	 	that	is	out	there	,	and	that	we	know	is	 avail 	 able 	 	to	us	if	we	can	just	figure	out	a	way	of	 access 	 ing 	 	it	.
each	blog	post	,	each	blog	 comment 	 ary 	 	may	not	,	in	and	of	 it 	 self 	 	,	be	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	we	're	looking	for	,	but	 collect 	 ively 	 	the	judgment	of	 t 	 hose 	 	people	 post 	 ing 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	people	 link 	 ing 	 	,	more	often	than	not	is	going	to	give	you	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	and	 enormous 	 ly 	 	 valu 	 able 	 	picture	of	what	's	going	on	.
so	,	that	's	the	positive	side	of	it	.
that	's	the	positive	side	of	what	is	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 particip 	 atory 	 	 journal 	 ism 	 	or	citizen	 journal 	 ism 	 	,	etc	.	--
that	,	in	fact	,	we	are	giving	people	who	have	never	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	talk	before	a	voice	,	and	we	're	able	to	access	information	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	there	but	 ha 	 s 	 	 essential 	 ly 	 	gone	 un 	 ta 	 pped 	 	.
but	there	is	a	dark	side	to	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	that	's	what	i	want	to	 s 	 pend 	 	the	last	part	of	my	talk	on	.
one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 happen 	 s 	 	if	you	 s 	 pend 	 	a	lot	of	time	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	and	you	 s 	 pend 	 	a	lot	of	time	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	is	that	it	is	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	to	fall	in	love	with	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
it	is	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	to	fall	in	love	with	the	 de 	 central 	 ized 	 	,	bottom	-	up	structure	of	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
it	is	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	to	think	that	 network 	 s 	 	are	 necess 	 arily 	 	good	 thing 	 s 	 	--	that	 be 	 ing 	 	linked	from	one	place	to	 an 	 other 	 	,	that	 be 	 ing 	 	 tight 	 ly 	 	linked	in	a	group	,	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	thing	.
and	much	of	the	time	it	is	.
but	there	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	 down 	 side 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	--	a	kind	of	dark	side	,	in	fact	--	and	that	is	that	the	more	 tight 	 ly 	 	linked	we	've	 be 	 come 	 	to	each	other	,	the	 hard 	 er 	 	it	is	for	each	of	us	to	remain	 in 	 dependent 	 	.
one	of	the	fundamental	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	of	a	network	is	that	,	once	you	are	linked	in	the	network	,	the	network	 start 	 s 	 	to	shape	your	 view 	 s 	 	and	 start 	 s 	 	to	shape	your	 interact 	 ions 	 	with	 every 	 body 	 	else	.
that	's	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 define 	 s 	 	what	a	network	is	.
a	network	is	not	just	the	product	of	 it 	 s 	 	component	 part 	 s 	 	.
it	is	 some 	 thing 	 	more	than	that	.
it	is	,	 a 	 s 	 	steven	johnson	 ha 	 s 	 	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	,	an	 emerge 	 nt 	 	 phenomen 	 on 	 	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	all	these	 benefit 	 s 	 	:	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 benefici 	 al 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	efficiency	of	 commun 	 ic 	 ating 	 	information	;	it	 give 	 s 	 	you	access	to	a	whole	host	of	people	;	it	 allow 	 s 	 	people	to	coordinate	 the 	 ir 	 	 activ 	 ities 	 	in	 ver 	 y 	 	good	ways	.
but	the	problem	is	that	 group 	 s 	 	are	 on 	 ly 	 	smart	when	the	people	in	them	are	 a 	 s 	 	 in 	 dependent 	 	 a 	 s 	 	possible	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	paradox	of	the	 wis 	 dom 	 	of	 crowd 	 s 	 	,	or	the	paradox	of	 collect 	 ive 	 	 intellig 	 ence 	 	,	that	what	it	 requir 	 es 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	form	of	 in 	 dependent 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	.
and	 network 	 s 	 	make	it	 hard 	 er 	 	for	people	to	do	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	drive	attention	to	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	the	network	 value 	 s 	 	.
so	,	one	of	the	 phenomen 	 a 	 	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	in	the	 blog 	 o 	 sphere 	 	is	that	once	a	meme	,	once	an	idea	 get 	 s 	 	going	,	it	is	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	for	people	to	just	sort	of	pile	on	,	 be 	 cause 	 	other	people	have	,	say	,	a	link	.
people	have	linked	to	it	,	and	so	other	people	in	turn	link	to	it	,	etc	.	,	etc	.
and	that	 phenomen 	 on 	 	of	 pil 	 ing 	 	on	the	 exist 	 ing 	 	 link 	 s 	 	is	one	that	is	 character 	 istic 	 	of	the	 blog 	 o 	 sphere 	 	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	of	the	 politic 	 al 	 	 blog 	 o 	 sphere 	 	,	and	it	is	one	that	 essential 	 ly 	 	 throw 	 s 	 	off	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	 de 	 central 	 ized 	 	,	bottom	-	up	 intellig 	 ence 	 	that	 blog 	 s 	 	can	manifest	in	the	right	 condition 	 s 	 	.
the	metaphor	that	i	like	to	use	is	the	metaphor	of	the	 circul 	 ar 	 	mill	.
a	lot	of	people	talk	about	ants	.
you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 con 	 ference 	 	inspired	by	nature	.
when	we	talk	about	bottom	-	up	,	 de 	 central 	 ized 	 	 phenomen 	 a 	 	,	the	ant	 colon 	 y 	 	is	the	classic	metaphor	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	no	individual	ant	 know 	 s 	 	what	it	's	 do 	 ing 	 	,	but	 collect 	 ively 	 	ants	are	able	to	reach	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	intelligent	 decision 	 s 	 	.
they	're	able	to	guide	 the 	 ir 	 	traffic	with	 remark 	 able 	 	speed	.
so	,	the	ant	 colon 	 y 	 	is	a	great	model	:	you	have	all	these	little	 part 	 s 	 	that	 collect 	 ively 	 	add	up	to	a	great	thing	.
but	we	know	that	 occasion 	 ally 	 	ants	go	 ast 	 ray 	 	,	and	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	that	,	if	 arm 	 y 	 	ants	are	 wander 	 ing 	 	around	and	they	get	lost	,	they	start	to	follow	a	simple	rule	--	just	do	what	the	ant	in	front	of	you	 do 	 es 	 	.
and	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	that	the	ants	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	end	up	in	a	circle	.
and	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	famous	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	one	that	was	1,200	feet	long	and	 last 	 ed 	 	for	two	 day 	 s 	 	,	and	the	ants	just	 ke 	 pt 	 	 march 	 ing 	 	around	and	around	in	a	circle	 un 	 til 	 	they	 di 	 ed 	 	.
and	that	,	i	think	,	is	a	sort	of	thing	to	watch	out	for	.
that	's	the	thing	we	have	to	fear	--	is	that	we	're	just	going	to	keep	 march 	 ing 	 	around	and	around	 un 	 til 	 	we	die	.
now	,	i	want	to	connect	 th 	 is 	 	back	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	to	the	tsunami	,	 be 	 cause 	 	one	of	the	great	 thing 	 s 	 	about	the	tsunami	--	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	 blog 	 o 	 sphere 	 	's	 cover 	 age 	 	,	not	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	tsunami	 it 	 self 	 	--	is	that	it	 re 	 ally 	 	did	represent	a	genuine	bottom	-	up	 phenomen 	 on 	 	.	you	saw	 s 	 ites 	 	that	had	never	 exist 	 ed 	 	before	 get 	 ting 	 	huge	 amount 	 s 	 	of	traffic	.
you	saw	people	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	 off 	 er 	 	up	 the 	 ir 	 	 in 	 dependent 	 	 point 	 s 	 	of	view	in	a	way	that	they	had	n't	before	.
there	,	you	 re 	 ally 	 	did	see	the	 intellig 	 ence 	 	of	the	web	manifest	 it 	 self 	 	.
so	,	that	's	the	 up 	 side 	 	.	the	 circul 	 ar 	 	mill	is	the	 down 	 side 	 	.
and	i	think	that	the	 form 	 er 	 	is	what	we	 re 	 ally 	 	need	to	 striv 	 e 	 	for	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
