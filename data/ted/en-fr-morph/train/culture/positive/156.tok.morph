like	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	here	,	i	am	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 con 	 tribute 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	a	 ren 	 aiss 	 ance 	 	in	africa	.
the	question	of	 transform 	 ation 	 	in	africa	 re 	 ally 	 	is	a	question	of	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	.
africa	can	 on 	 ly 	 	be	 transform 	 ed 	 	by	 enlighten 	 ed 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	.
and	it	is	my	 content 	 ion 	 	that	the	manner	in	which	we	 educ 	 ate 	 	our	 lead 	 ers 	 	is	fundamental	to	progress	on	 th 	 is 	 	continent	.
i	want	to	tell	you	some	 st 	 ories 	 	that	explain	my	view	.
we	all	heard	about	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	 st 	 ories 	 	 yester 	 day 	 	.
an	american	friend	of	mine	 th 	 is 	 	year	 volunteer 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	nurse	in	ghana	,
and	in	a	period	of	three	 month 	 s 	 	she	came	to	a	 con 	 clusion 	 	about	the	state	of	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	in	africa	that	had	taken	me	over	a	decade	to	reach	.
twice	she	was	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 s 	 urge 	 ries 	 	where	they	lost	power	at	the	hospital	.
the	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	 gene 	 rator 	 s 	 	did	not	start	.	there	was	not	a	 flash 	 light 	 	,	not	a	 lan 	 ter 	 n 	 	,	not	a	candle	--
pitch	black	.
the	patient	's	cut	open	,	twice	.
the	first	time	it	was	a	c	-	section	.
 thank 	 fully 	 	,	baby	was	out	--	mother	and	child	 surviv 	 ed 	 	.
the	second	time	was	a	procedure	that	 involve 	 d 	 	local	 an 	 est 	 hesia 	 	.
 anesthet 	 ic 	 	 wear 	 s 	 	off	.	the	patient	 feel 	 s 	 	pain	.
he	's	 cry 	 ing 	 	.	he	's	 s 	 cream 	 ing 	 	.	he	's	 pray 	 ing 	 	.
pitch	black	.	not	a	candle	,	not	a	 flash 	 light 	 	.
and	that	hospital	could	have	 afford 	 ed 	 	 flash 	 light 	 s 	 	.
they	could	have	 afford 	 ed 	 	to	purchase	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	but	they	did	n't	.
and	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	twice	.
 an 	 other 	 	time	,	she	 watch 	 ed 	 	in	 horr 	 or 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 nurse 	 s 	 	 watch 	 ed 	 	a	patient	die	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 re 	 fused 	 	to	give	her	oxygen	that	they	had	.
and	so	three	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	just	before	she	 return 	 ed 	 	to	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	 nurse 	 s 	 	in	accra	go	on	strike	.
and	her	 recommend 	 ation 	 	is	take	 th 	 is 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	fire	 every 	 one 	 	,	start	all	over	 aga 	 in 	 	.
start	all	over	 aga 	 in 	 	.
now	what	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	have	to	do	with	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	?
you	see	,	the	 folk 	 s 	 	at	the	 mini 	 stry 	 	of	health	,	the	hospital	 administr 	 ators 	 	,	the	 doctor 	 s 	 	,	the	 nurse 	 s 	 	--	they	are	among	just	five	percent	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 peer 	 s 	 	who	get	an	education	after	 second 	 ary 	 	school	.
they	are	the	elite	.	they	are	our	 lead 	 ers 	 	.
 the 	 ir 	 	 decision 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 action 	 s 	 	matter	.
and	when	they	fail	,	a	nation	 liter 	 ally 	 	 suffer 	 s 	 	.
so	when	i	speak	of	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	,	i	'm	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	just	 politic 	 al 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	.
we	've	heard	a	lot	about	that	.
i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	elite	.	 t 	 hose 	 	who	've	 be 	 en 	 	trained	,
 who 	 s 	 e 	 	job	it	is	to	be	the	 guard 	 ians 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
the	 lawyer 	 s 	 	,	the	 judg 	 es 	 	,	the	 police 	 men 	 	,	the	 doctor 	 s 	 	,	the	 engineer 	 s 	 	,	the	civil	 serv 	 ants 	 	--	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	 lead 	 ers 	 	.
and	we	need	to	train	them	right	.
now	,	my	first	 point 	 ed 	 	and	 memor 	 able 	 	experience	with	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	in	ghana	 occur 	 red 	 	when	i	was	16	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
we	had	just	had	a	 militar 	 y 	 	coup	,	and	 soldier 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	pervasive	in	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	a	pervasive	presence	.
and	one	day	i	go	to	the	 air 	 port 	 	to	meet	my	father	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	i	walk	up	 th 	 is 	 	grassy	 slop 	 e 	 	from	the	car	park	to	the	terminal	building	,	i	'm	 stop 	 ped 	 	by	two	 soldier 	 s 	 	 wield 	 ing 	 	ak	-	47	assault	 weapon 	 s 	 	.
and	they	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	to	join	a	crowd	of	people	that	 we 	 re 	 	running	up	and	down	 th 	 is 	 	 em 	 bank 	 ment 	 	.
why	?	 be 	 cause 	 	the	path	i	had	taken	was	 consider 	 ed 	 	out	of	 bound 	 s 	 	.
no	sign	to	 th 	 is 	 	effect	.
now	,	i	was	16.	i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	what	my	 peer 	 s 	 	at	school	might	think	if	they	saw	me	running	up	and	down	 th 	 is 	 	hill	.
i	was	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 concern 	 ed 	 	of	what	the	 girl 	 s 	 	might	think	.
and	so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	 argu 	 e 	 	with	these	men	.
it	was	a	little	reckless	,	but	you	know	,	i	was	16	.
i	got	 luck 	 y 	 	.
a	ghana	airways	pilot	 fall 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	same	 pre 	 dica 	 ment 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	of	his	uniform	they	speak	to	him	 different 	 ly 	 	,	and	they	explain	to	him	that	they	're	just	 follow 	 ing 	 	 order 	 s 	 	.
so	he	 take 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	radio	,	 talk 	 s 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 bo 	 s 	 s 	 	,	and	 get 	 s 	 	us	all	released	.
what	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	would	you	take	from	an	experience	like	 th 	 is 	 	?
 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	,	for	me	.
 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	 matter 	 s 	 	.	 t 	 hose 	 	men	are	 follow 	 ing 	 	the	 order 	 s 	 	of	a	 super 	 ior 	 	officer	.
i	 learn 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	about	courage	.
it	was	 import 	 ant 	 	not	to	look	at	 t 	 hose 	 	 gun 	 s 	 	.
and	i	 al 	 so 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	it	can	be	 help 	 ful 	 	to	think	about	 girl 	 s 	 	.
so	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	after	 th 	 is 	 	event	,	i	 leav 	 e 	 	ghana	on	a	 scholar 	 ship 	 	to	go	to	swarthmore	college	for	my	education	.
it	was	a	breath	of	fresh	air	.
you	know	,	the	 facul 	 ty 	 	there	did	n't	want	us	to	 memor 	 ize 	 	information	and	repeat	back	to	them	 a 	 s 	 	i	was	used	to	back	in	ghana	.
they	 want 	 ed 	 	us	to	think	 critical 	 ly 	 	.
they	 want 	 ed 	 	us	to	be	 analytic 	 al 	 	.
they	 want 	 ed 	 	us	to	be	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	social	 issue 	 s 	 	.
in	my	 economic 	 s 	 	 class 	 es 	 	i	got	high	 mark 	 s 	 	for	my	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	 bas 	 ic 	 	 economic 	 s 	 	.
but	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	more	 pro 	 found 	 	than	that	,	which	is	that	the	 lead 	 ers 	 	--	the	 manage 	 rs 	 	of	ghana	's	 eco 	 nomy 	 	--	 we 	 re 	 	making	breathtakingly	bad	 decision 	 s 	 	that	had	 br 	 ought 	 	our	 eco 	 nomy 	 	to	the	 br 	 ink 	 	of	collapse	.
and	so	here	was	 th 	 is 	 	 less 	 on 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	--	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	 matter 	 s 	 	.
it	 matter 	 s 	 	a	great	deal	.
but	i	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	fully	understand	what	had	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	me	at	swarthmore	.
i	had	an	 ink 	 ling 	 	,
but	i	did	n't	fully	 real 	 ize 	 	it	 un 	 til 	 	i	went	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	 work 	 place 	 	and	i	went	to	work	at	 micro 	 soft 	 	corporation	.
and	i	was	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	team	--	 th 	 is 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	,	 learn 	 ing 	 	team	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	job	it	was	to	design	and	implement	new	 soft 	 ware 	 	that	 create 	 d 	 	value	in	the	world	.
and	it	was	 brilli 	 ant 	 	to	be	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	team	.
it	was	 brilli 	 ant 	 	.
and	i	 real 	 ized 	 	just	what	had	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	me	at	swarthmore	,	 th 	 is 	 	 transform 	 ation 	 	--	the	ability	to	confront	 problem 	 s 	 	,	complex	 problem 	 s 	 	,	and	to	design	 solution 	 s 	 	to	 t 	 hose 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	.
the	ability	to	create	is	the	most	 empower 	 ing 	 	thing	that	can	happen	to	an	individual	.
and	i	was	part	of	that	.
now	,	while	i	was	at	 micro 	 soft 	 	,	the	annual	 revenue 	 s 	 	of	that	company	grew	 large 	 r 	 	than	the	gdp	of	the	 re 	 public 	 	of	ghana	.
and	by	the	way	,	it	's	 continu 	 ed 	 	to	.
the	gap	 ha 	 s 	 	 widen 	 ed 	 	since	i	left	.
now	,	i	've	 al 	 ready 	 	spoken	about	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	why	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 occur 	 red 	 	.
i	mean	,	it	's	the	people	there	who	are	so	 hard 	 work 	 ing 	 	,	 persist 	 ent 	 	,	creative	,	 empower 	 ed 	 	.
but	there	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 so 	 	some	external	 factor 	 s 	 	:	free	 market 	 s 	 	,	the	rule	of	law	,	 infra 	 structure 	 	.	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 provide 	 d 	 	by	 institution 	 s 	 	run	by	the	people	that	i	call	 lead 	 ers 	 	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	did	not	emerge	 spontane 	 ously 	 	.
 some 	 body 	 	trained	them	to	do	the	work	that	they	do	.
now	,	while	i	was	at	 micro 	 soft 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	funny	thing	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
i	 be 	 came 	 	a	parent	.
and	for	the	first	time	,	africa	 matter 	 ed 	 	more	to	me	than	ever	before	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	the	state	of	the	african	continent	would	matter	to	my	children	and	 the 	 ir 	 	children	.
that	the	state	of	the	world	--	the	state	of	the	world	 depend 	 s 	 	on	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	to	africa	,	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	my	 kid 	 s 	 	would	be	 concern 	 ed 	 	.
and	at	 th 	 is 	 	time	,	when	i	was	going	through	what	i	call	my	``	pre	-	mid	-	life	crisis	,	``	africa	was	a	mess	.
somalia	had	disintegrated	 in 	 to 	 	 anarch 	 y 	 	.
rwanda	was	in	the	throes	of	 th 	 is 	 	genocidal	war	.
and	it	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	me	that	that	was	the	wrong	direction	,	and	i	 need 	 ed 	 	to	be	back	 help 	 ing 	 	.
i	could	n't	just	stay	in	seattle	and	raise	my	 kid 	 s 	 	in	an	upper	-	middle	class	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	and	feel	good	about	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	not	the	world	that	i	'd	want	my	children	to	grow	up	in	.
so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	get	 engag 	 ed 	 	,	and	the	first	thing	that	i	did	was	to	come	back	to	ghana	and	talk	with	a	lot	of	people	and	 re 	 ally 	 	try	to	understand	what	the	real	 issue 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	.
and	three	 thing 	 s 	 	 ke 	 pt 	 	coming	up	for	every	problem	:	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	,	weak	 institution 	 s 	 	and	the	people	who	run	them	--	the	 lead 	 ers 	 	.	now	,	i	was	a	little	 scar 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	when	you	see	 t 	 hose 	 	three	 problem 	 s 	 	,	they	seem	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	to	deal	with	.
and	they	might	say	,	``	look	,	do	n't	even	try	.	``
but	,	for	me	,	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	question	,	``	well	,	where	are	these	 lead 	 ers 	 	coming	from	?
what	is	it	about	ghana	that	 produce 	 s 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	that	are	 un 	 ethic 	 al 	 	or	 un 	 able 	 	to	solve	 problem 	 s 	 	?	``
so	i	went	to	look	at	what	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	our	 education 	 al 	 	system	.
and	it	was	the	same	--	 learn 	 ing 	 	by	 rot 	 e 	 	--	from	 prim 	 ary 	 	school	through	graduate	school	.
 ver 	 y 	 	little	 emphas 	 is 	 	on	 ethic 	 s 	 	,
and	the	typical	graduate	from	a	university	in	ghana	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 strong 	 er 	 	sense	of	entitlement	than	a	sense	of	 respons 	 ibility 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	wrong	.
so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	engage	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	problem	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	that	every	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	every	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	must	be	 ver 	 y 	 	intentional	about	how	it	 train 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	.
and	ghana	was	not	 pay 	 ing 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	attention	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	true	 a 	 cross 	 	sub	-	saharan	africa	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	now	.
i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	the	experience	that	i	had	at	swarthmore	to	africa	.
i	wish	there	was	a	liberal	 art 	 s 	 	college	in	every	african	country	.
i	think	it	would	make	a	huge	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
and	what	ashesi	university	is	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	is	to	train	a	new	generation	of	 ethic 	 al 	 	,	 entrepreneur 	 ial 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	.
we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	train	 lead 	 ers 	 	of	 exception 	 al 	 	 integ 	 r 	 ity 	 	,	who	have	the	ability	to	confront	the	complex	 problem 	 s 	 	,	ask	the	right	 question 	 s 	 	,	and	come	up	with	 work 	 able 	 	 solution 	 s 	 	.
i	'll	admit	that	there	are	 time 	 s 	 	when	it	 seem 	 s 	 	like	``	mission	:	 im 	 possible 	 	,	``
but	we	must	 believ 	 e 	 	that	these	 kid 	 s 	 	are	smart	.
that	if	we	involve	them	in	 the 	 ir 	 	education	,	if	we	have	them	discuss	the	real	 issue 	 s 	 	that	they	confront	--	that	our	whole	 socie 	 ty 	 	 confront 	 s 	 	--	and	if	we	give	them	 skill 	 s 	 	that	 en 	 able 	 	them	to	engage	the	real	world	,	that	magic	will	happen	.
now	,	a	month	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	project	,	we	'd	just	 start 	 ed 	 	 class 	 es 	 	.
and	a	month	 in 	 to 	 	it	,	i	come	to	the	 off 	 ice 	 	,	and	i	have	 th 	 is 	 	email	from	one	of	our	 student 	 s 	 	.
and	it	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	,	``	i	am	 think 	 ing 	 	now	.	``
and	he	 sign 	 s 	 	off	,	``	thank	you	.	``
it	's	 s 	 uch 	 	a	simple	 state 	 ment 	 	.
but	i	was	 move 	 d 	 	 al 	 most 	 	to	 tear 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 under 	 stood 	 	what	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	young	man	.
and	it	is	an	awesome	thing	to	be	a	part	of	 empower 	 ing 	 	 some 	 one 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
i	am	 think 	 ing 	 	now	.
 th 	 is 	 	year	we	 challeng 	 ed 	 	our	 student 	 s 	 	to	craft	an	honor	code	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
there	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 vib 	 rant 	 	debate	going	on	on	campus	now	over	 whet 	 her 	 	they	should	have	an	honor	code	,	and	if	so	,	what	it	should	look	like	.
one	of	the	 student 	 s 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	a	question	that	just	 warm 	 ed 	 	my	heart	.
can	we	create	a	perfect	 socie 	 ty 	 	?
her	 understand 	 ing 	 	that	a	student	-	 craft 	 ed 	 	honor	code	 constitute 	 s 	 	a	reach	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 perfect 	 ion 	 	is	 in 	 credible 	 	.
now	,	we	can	not	 achiev 	 e 	 	 perfect 	 ion 	 	,
but	if	we	reach	for	it	,	then	we	can	 achiev 	 e 	 	excellence	.
i	do	n't	know	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	what	they	will	do	.
i	do	n't	know	 whet 	 her 	 	they	will	decide	to	have	 th 	 is 	 	honor	code	.
but	the	conversation	they	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	now	--	about	what	 the 	 ir 	 	good	 socie 	 ty 	 	should	look	like	,	what	 the 	 ir 	 	 excel 	 lent 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	should	look	like	,	is	a	 re 	 ally 	 	good	thing	.
am	i	out	of	time	?	ok	.
now	,	i	just	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 leav 	 e 	 	that	slide	up	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	that	we	think	about	it	.
i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	the	fact	that	every	student	at	ashesi	university	 do 	 es 	 	community	service	before	they	graduate	.
that	for	 man 	 y 	 	of	them	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	life	-	 alter 	 ing 	 	experience	.
these	young	future	 lead 	 ers 	 	are	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	understand	the	real	business	of	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	,	the	real	privilege	of	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	,	which	is	after	all	to	serve	 human 	 ity 	 	.
i	am	even	more	 thrill 	 ed 	 	by	the	fact	that	 l 	 east 	 	year	our	student	body	 elect 	 ed 	 	a	woman	to	be	the	head	of	student	government	.
it	's	the	first	time	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	ghana	that	a	woman	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 elect 	 ed 	 	head	of	student	government	at	any	university	.
it	 say 	 s 	 	a	lot	about	her	.
it	 say 	 s 	 	a	lot	about	the	culture	that	's	 form 	 ing 	 	on	campus	.
it	 say 	 s 	 	a	lot	about	her	 peer 	 s 	 	who	 elect 	 ed 	 	her	.
she	won	with	75	percent	of	the	vote	.
and	it	 give 	 s 	 	me	a	lot	of	hope	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	corporate	west	africa	 al 	 so 	 	 appreciate 	 s 	 	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	with	our	 student 	 s 	 	.
we	've	 graduate 	 d 	 	two	 class 	 es 	 	of	 student 	 s 	 	to	date	.
and	every	single	one	of	them	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 place 	 d 	 	.
and	we	're	 get 	 ting 	 	great	 report 	 s 	 	back	from	corporate	ghana	,	corporate	west	africa	,
and	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	they	're	most	 impress 	 ed 	 	about	is	work	ethic	.
you	know	,	that	 pass 	 ion 	 	for	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	.
the	 persist 	 ence 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	ability	to	deal	with	 ambigu 	 ity 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	ability	to	tackle	 problem 	 s 	 	that	they	have	n't	 s 	 een 	 	before	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	good	 be 	 cause 	 	over	the	past	five	 year 	 s 	 	,	there	have	 be 	 en 	 	 time 	 s 	 	when	i	've	felt	 th 	 is 	 	is	``	mission	:	 im 	 possible 	 	.	``
and	it	's	just	 wonder 	 ful 	 	to	see	these	 glimmer 	 s 	 	of	the	promise	of	what	can	happen	if	we	train	our	 kid 	 s 	 	right	.
i	think	that	the	current	and	future	 lead 	 ers 	 	of	africa	have	an	 in 	 credible 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	drive	a	major	 ren 	 aiss 	 ance 	 	on	the	continent	.
it	's	an	 in 	 credible 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
there	are	n't	 ver 	 y 	 	 man 	 y 	 	more	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	world	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	africa	 ha 	 s 	 	 reach 	 ed 	 	an	 inf 	 le 	 ction 	 	point	with	a	march	of	 demo 	 cracy 	 	and	free	 market 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	continent	.
we	have	 reach 	 ed 	 	a	moment	from	which	can	emerge	a	great	 socie 	 ty 	 	 with 	 in 	 	one	generation	.	it	will	depend	on	inspired	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	.
and	it	is	my	 content 	 ion 	 	that	the	manner	in	which	we	train	our	 lead 	 ers 	 	will	make	all	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
thank	you	,	and	god	bless	.
