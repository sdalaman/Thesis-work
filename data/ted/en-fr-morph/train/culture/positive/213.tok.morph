i	hope	you	'll	understand	my	english	.
in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 s 	 	it	is	 terr 	 ible 	 	,	and	the	afternoon	is	worst	.
 dur 	 ing 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	made	some	 speech 	 es 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	:	``	city	is	not	a	problem	,	it	's	a	solution	.	``
and	more	and	more	,	i	'm	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	that	it	's	not	 on 	 ly 	 	a	solution	for	a	country	,	but	it	's	a	solution	for	the	problem	of	climate	change	.
but	we	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 pessim 	 istic 	 	approach	about	the	cities	.	i	'm	 work 	 ing 	 	in	cities	for	 al 	 most 	 	40	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	where	every	mayor	is	 try 	 ing 	 	to	tell	me	his	city	is	so	big	,
or	the	other	 mayor 	 s 	 	say	,	``	we	do	n't	have	financial	 resource 	 s 	 	,	``	i	would	like	to	say	from	the	experience	i	had	:	every	city	in	the	world	can	be	 improv 	 ed 	 	in	less	than	three	 year 	 s 	 	.
there	's	no	matter	of	scale	.	it	's	not	a	question	of	scale	,	it	's	not	a	question	of	financial	 resource 	 s 	 	.
every	problem	in	a	city	 ha 	 s 	 	to	have	 it 	 s 	 	own	 equ 	 ation 	 	of	co	-	 respons 	 ibility 	 
and	 al 	 so 	 	a	design	.
so	to	start	,	i	want	to	 introduc 	 e 	 	some	 character 	 s 	 	from	a	book	i	made	for	 teenager 	 s 	 	.
the	best	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	quality	of	life	is	the	turtle	 be 	 cause 	 	the	turtle	is	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	living	and	 work 	 ing 	 	together	.
and	when	you	 real 	 ize 	 	that	the	 ca 	 s 	 que 	 	of	the	turtle	 look 	 s 	 	like	an	urban	tessitura	,	and	can	we	imagine	,	if	we	cut	the	 ca 	 s 	 que 	 	of	the	turtle	,	how	 s 	 ad 	 	she	's	going	to	be	?
and	that	's	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	in	our	cities	:
living	here	,	 work 	 ing 	 	here	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	leisure	here	.
and	most	of	the	people	are	 leav 	 ing 	 	the	city	and	living	 out 	 side 	 	of	the	city	.
so	,	the	other	character	is	otto	,	the	 auto 	 mobile 	 	.
he	is	 invit 	 ed 	 	for	a	party	--	he	never	 want 	 s 	 	to	 leav 	 e 	 	.
the	 chair 	 s 	 	are	on	the	 table 	 s 	 	and	still	 drink 	 ing 	 	,	and	he	 drink 	 s 	 	a	lot	.
and	he	 cough 	 s 	 	a	lot	.	 ver 	 y 	 	 egot 	 istic 	 al 	 	:
he	 car 	 ries 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	one	or	two	people
and	he	 ask 	 s 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	for	more	 infra 	 structure 	 	.
 free 	 ways 	 	.
he	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 demand 	 ing 	 	person	.
and	on	the	other	hand	,	 accord 	 ion 	 	,	the	friendly	bus	,	he	 car 	 ries 	 	300	people	--	275	in	sweden	;	300	brazilians	.
 s 	 peaking 	 	about	the	design	:	every	city	 ha 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	own	design	.
curitiba	,	my	city	:	three	million	in	the	 metro 	 politan 	 	area	,	1,800,000	people	in	the	city	 it 	 self 	 	.
curitiba	,	rio	:	it	's	like	two	 bird 	 s 	 	 kiss 	 ing 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
oaxaca	,	san	francisco	--	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	:
market	street	,	van	ness	and	the	 water 	 front 	 	.
and	every	city	 ha 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	own	design	.
but	to	make	it	happen	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	you	have	to	 pro 	 pose 	 	a	scenario
and	to	 pro 	 pose 	 	a	design	--	an	idea	that	 every 	 one 	 	,	or	the	large	 major 	 ity 	 	,	will	help	you	to	make	it	happen	.
and	that	's	the	structure	of	the	city	of	curitiba	.
and	it	's	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	living	and	 work 	 ing 	 	together	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	we	have	more	density	;	it	's	where	we	have	more	public	transport	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	system	 start 	 ed 	 	in	'74	.	we	 start 	 ed 	 	with	25,000	 passenger 	 s 	 	a	day	,	now	it	's	2,200,000	 passenger 	 s 	 	a	day	.
and	it	took	25	 year 	 s 	 	 un 	 til 	 	 an 	 other 	 	city	...	which	is	bogota	,	and	they	did	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	job	.
and	now	there	's	83	cities	all	over	the	world	that	they	are	 do 	 ing 	 	what	they	call	the	brt	of	curitiba	.
and	one	thing	:	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	not	for	 on 	 ly 	 	your	own	city	;
every	city	,	 be 	 side 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	normal	 problem 	 s 	 	,	they	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	role	in	 be 	 ing 	 	with	the	whole	 human 	 ity 	 	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	 most 	 ly 	 	two	main	 issue 	 s 	 	--	 mobil 	 ity 	 	and	 sustain 	 ability 	 	--	are	 be 	 coming 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	for	the	cities	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 articulate 	 d 	 	bus	,	double	-	 articulate 	 d 	 	.
and	we	are	 ver 	 y 	 	close	to	my	house	.
you	can	come	when	you	are	in	curitiba	and	have	a	coffee	there	.
and	that	's	the	evolution	of	the	system	.
what	in	the	design	that	made	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	is	the	 board 	 ing 	 	 tube 	 s 	 	:
the	 board 	 ing 	 	tube	 give 	 s 	 	to	the	bus	the	same	performance	 a 	 s 	 	a	 sub 	 way 	 	.
that	's	why	,	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	say	,	it	's	like	metro	-	nizing	the	bus	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	design	of	the	bus	,
and	you	can	pay	before	 enter 	 ing 	 	the	bus	you	're	 board 	 ing 	 	.
and	for	 handicap 	 ped 	 	,	they	can	use	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	normal	system	.
what	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	say	is	the	major	 con 	 trib 	 ution 	 	on	carbon	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	are	from	the	 car 	 s 	 	--
more	than	50	percent	--	so	when	we	depend	 on 	 ly 	 	on	 car 	 s 	 	,	it	's	...	--	that	's	why	when	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 sustain 	 ability 	 	,	it	's	not	 en 	 ough 	 	,	green	 building 	 s 	 	.
it	's	not	 en 	 ough 	 	,	a	new	 material 	 s 	 	.	it	's	not	 en 	 ough 	 	,	new	 source 	 s 	 	of	energy	.
it	's	the	 con 	 cept 	 	of	the	city	,	the	design	of	the	city	,
that	's	 al 	 so 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	too	.	and	 al 	 so 	 	,	how	to	teach	the	children	.
i	'll	speak	on	 th 	 is 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	on	.
our	idea	of	 mobil 	 ity 	 	is	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	the	 connect 	 ions 	 	between	all	the	 system 	 s 	 	.
we	 start 	 ed 	 	in	'83	,	 pro 	 posing 	 	for	the	city	of	rio	how	to	connect	the	 sub 	 way 	 	with	the	bus	.
the	 sub 	 way 	 	was	against	,	of	course	.
and	23	 year 	 s 	 	after	,	they	 call 	 ed 	 	us	to	develop	--	we	're	 develop 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	idea	.
and	you	can	understand	how	different	it	's	going	to	be	,	the	image	of	rio	with	the	system	--	one	-	minute	frequency	.
and	it	's	not	shanghai	,	it	's	not	 be 	 ing 	 	 color 	 ed 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	day	,	 on 	 ly 	 	at	night	it	will	look	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
and	before	you	say	it	's	a	norman	foster	design	,	we	designed	 th 	 is 	 	in	'83	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	model	,	how	it	's	going	to	work	.	so	,	it	's	the	same	system	;	the	vehicle	is	different	.	and	that	's	the	model	.
what	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	say	is	,	i	'm	not	 try 	 ing 	 	to	prove	which	system	of	transport	is	better	.
i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	say	we	have	to	combine	all	the	 system 	 s 	 	,	and	with	one	condition	:	never	--	if	you	have	a	 sub 	 way 	 	,	if	you	have	surface	 system 	 s 	 	,	if	you	have	any	kind	of	system	--	never	compete	in	the	same	space	.
and	coming	back	to	the	car	,	i	 al 	 ways 	 	used	to	say	that	the	car	is	like	your	mother	-	in	-	law	:
you	have	to	have	good	relationship	with	her	,	but	she	can	not	command	your	life	.
so	,	when	the	 on 	 ly 	 	woman	in	your	life	is	your	mother	-	in	-	law	,	you	have	a	problem	.
so	,	all	the	 idea 	 s 	 	about	how	to	transform	through	design	--	old	 quar 	 ries 	 	and	open	 un 	 ive 	 rs 	 ities 	 	and	botanic	garden	--	all	of	it	's	related	to	how	we	teach	the	children	.
and	the	children	,	we	teach	 dur 	 ing 	 	six	 month 	 s 	 	how	to	 separat 	 e 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	garbage	.
and	after	,	the	children	teach	 the 	 ir 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	.
and	now	we	have	70	percent	--	since	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	it	's	the	highest	rate	of	 separat 	 ion 	 	of	garbage	in	the	world	.
seven	zero	.	so	teach	the	children	.
i	would	like	to	say	,	if	we	want	to	have	a	 sustain 	 able 	 	world	we	have	to	work	with	 every 	 thing 	 	what	's	 s 	 aid 	 	,
but	do	n't	forget	the	cities	and	the	children	.
i	'm	 work 	 ing 	 	in	a	museum	and	 al 	 so 	 	a	multi	-	use	city	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	can	not	have	empty	 place 	 s 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	18	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	.
you	should	have	 al 	 ways 	 	a	structure	of	living	and	 work 	 ing 	 	together	.
try	to	understand	the	 sector 	 s 	 	in	the	city	that	could	play	different	 role 	 s 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	24	 hour 	 s 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	issue	is	,	a	city	's	like	our	family	portrait	.
we	do	n't	rip	our	family	portrait	,	even	if	we	do	n't	like	the	nose	of	our	uncle	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	portrait	is	you	.
and	these	are	the	 re 	 ference 	 s 	 	that	we	have	in	any	city	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	main	pedestrian	mall	;	we	did	it	in	72	 hour 	 s 	 	.	 y 	 es 	 	,	you	have	to	be	fast	.
and	these	are	the	 re 	 ference 	 s 	 	from	our	ethnic	 con 	 trib 	 ution 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	italian	 port 	 al 	 	,	the	ukrainian	park	,	the	polish	park	,	the	japanese	square	,	the	german	park	.
all	of	a	sudden	,	the	soviet	 un 	 ion 	 	,	they	split	.
and	since	we	have	people	from	uzbekistan	,	kazakhstan	,	tajikistan	,	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	,	we	have	to	stop	the	program	.
do	n't	forget	:	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	 start 	 s 	 	when	you	cut	a	zero	from	your	budget	.
if	you	cut	two	 zero 	 s 	 	,	it	's	much	better	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	wire	opera	theater	.	we	did	it	in	two	 month 	 s 	 	.
 park 	 s 	 	--	old	 quar 	 ries 	 	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	 transform 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 park 	 s 	 	.
 quar 	 ries 	 	once	made	the	nature	,	and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	we	took	 th 	 is 	 	and	we	 transform 	 ed 	 	.
and	every	part	can	be	 transform 	 ed 	 	;	every	frog	can	be	 transform 	 ed 	 	in	a	prince	.
so	,	in	a	city	,	you	have	to	work	fast	.
 plan 	 ning 	 	 take 	 s 	 	time	.	and	i	'm	 pro 	 posing 	 	urban	 acu 	 punctu 	 re 	 	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	me	,	with	some	 f 	 oc 	 al 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	to	help	the	normal	process	of	 plan 	 ning 	 	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 acu 	 punctu 	 re 	 	note	--	or	i.m	.	pei	's	.	some	small	 one 	 s 	 	can	make	the	city	better	.
the	 small 	 est 	 	park	in	new	york	,	the	most	 beaut 	 iful 	 	:	32	 meter 	 s 	 	.
so	,	i	want	just	to	end	 say 	 ing 	 	that	you	can	 al 	 ways 	 	 pro 	 pose 	 	new	 material 	 s 	 	--	new	 sustain 	 able 	 	 material 	 s 	 	--	but	keep	in	mind	that	we	have	to	work	fast
to	the	end	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	do	n't	have	the	whole	time	to	plan	.
and	i	think	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	,	 innov 	 ation 	 	is	 start 	 ing 	 	.	and	we	can	not	have	all	the	 answer 	 s 	 	.
so	when	you	start	--	and	we	can	not	be	so	 pre 	 potent 	 	on	 hav 	 ing 	 	all	the	 answer 	 s 	 	--
it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	and	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	 con 	 trib 	 ution 	 	from	people	,	and	they	could	teach	you	if	you	're	not	in	the	right	track	.
at	the	end	,	i	would	like	if	you	can	help	me	to	 s 	 ing 	 	the	 sustain 	 able 	 	song	.
