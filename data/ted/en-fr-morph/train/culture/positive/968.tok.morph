so	i	want	to	tell	you	a	story	--	an	 encourag 	 ing 	 	story	--	about	 address 	 ing 	 	 de 	 s 	 per 	 ation 	 	,	 depress 	 ion 	 	and	despair	in	afghanistan	,	and	what	we	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	it	,	and	how	to	help	people	to	 over 	 come 	 	 trauma 	 tic 	 	 experience 	 s 	 	and	how	to	help	them	to	regain	some	confidence	in	the	time	 a 	 head 	 	--	in	the	future	--	and	how	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	in	 every 	 day 	 	life	.
so	,	i	am	a	jungian	 psycho 	 analyst 	 	,	and	i	went	to	afghanistan	in	january	2004	,	by	chance	,	on	an	 assign 	 ment 	 	for	medica	 mon 	 dial 	 e 	 	.
jung	in	afghanistan	--	you	get	the	picture	.
afghanistan	is	one	of	the	 poor 	 est 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	in	the	world	,	and	70	percent	of	the	people	are	illiterate	.
war	and	 mal 	 nutrition 	 	 kill 	 s 	 	people	together	with	hope	.
you	may	know	 th 	 is 	 	from	the	media	,
but	what	you	may	not	know	is	that	the	average	age	of	the	afghan	people	is	17	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	they	grow	up	in	 s 	 uch 	 	an	environment	and	--	i	repeat	 my 	 self 	 	--	in	30	 year 	 s 	 	of	war	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 transl 	 ates 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 on 	 going 	 	violence	,	foreign	 interest 	 s 	 	,	 bribe 	 ry 	 	,	 drug 	 s 	 	,	ethnic	 conflict 	 s 	 	,	bad	health	,	shame	,	fear	and	cumulative	 trauma 	 tic 	 	 experience 	 s 	 	.
local	and	foreign	 militar 	 y 	 	are	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	build	peace	together	with	the	 donor 	 s 	 	and	the	 government 	 al 	 	and	non	-	 government 	 al 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	.
and	people	had	hope	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	but	 un 	 til 	 	they	 real 	 ized 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	 worsen 	 s 	 	every	day	--	either	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 kill 	 ed 	 	or	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 some 	 how 	 	,	they	are	 poor 	 er 	 	than	eight	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
one	figure	for	that	:	54	percent	of	the	children	under	the	age	of	five	 year 	 s 	 	suffer	from	 mal 	 nutrition 	 	.
yet	,	there	is	hope	.
one	day	a	man	told	me	,	``	my	future	 do 	 es 	 	not	look	 brilli 	 ant 	 	,	but	i	want	to	have	a	 brilli 	 ant 	 	future	for	my	son	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	i	took	in	2005	,	 walk 	 ing 	 	on	fridays	over	the	 hill 	 s 	 	in	kabul	,
and	for	me	it	's	a	 symbol 	 ic 	 	picture	of	an	open	future	for	a	young	generation	.
so	,	 doctor 	 s 	 	 pre 	 scribe 	 	 medic 	 ation 	 	.
and	 donor 	 s 	 	are	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	peace	by	building	 school 	 s 	 	and	 road 	 s 	 	.
 militar 	 y 	 	collect	 weapon 	 s 	 	,	and	 depress 	 ion 	 	 stay 	 s 	 	 in 	 tact 	 	.
why	?
 be 	 cause 	 	people	do	n't	have	 tool 	 s 	 	to	cope	with	it	,	to	get	over	it	.
so	,	soon	after	my	 arriv 	 al 	 	,	i	had	 confirm 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	which	i	had	 al 	 ready 	 	known	;	that	my	 instrument 	 s 	 	come	from	the	heart	of	modern	europe	,	 y 	 es 	 	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	what	can	wound	us	and	our	 re 	 action 	 	to	 t 	 hose 	 	 wound 	 s 	 	--	they	are	universal	.
and	the	big	 challeng 	 e 	 	was	how	to	understand	the	meaning	of	the	symptom	in	 th 	 is 	 	specific	cultural	 con 	 text 	 	.
after	a	 counsel 	 ing 	 	session	,	a	woman	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	``	 be 	 cause 	 	you	have	felt	me	,	i	can	feel	 my 	 self 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	,	and	i	want	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	in	my	family	life	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	family	is	central	in	afghans	'	social	system	.
no	one	can	 surviv 	 e 	 	 al 	 one 	 	.
and	if	people	feel	used	,	 worth 	 less 	 	and	 a 	 shame 	 d 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 horr 	 ible 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	them	,	then	they	 re 	 treat 	 	,	and	they	fall	 in 	 to 	 	social	 isol 	 ation 	 	,	and	they	do	not	 da 	 re 	 	to	tell	 th 	 is 	 	 e 	 vil 	 	to	other	people	or	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 love 	 d 	 	 one 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	do	not	want	to	burden	them	.
and	 ver 	 y 	 	often	violence	is	a	way	to	cope	with	it	.
 trauma 	 t 	 ized 	 	people	 al 	 so 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	lose	control	--	 symptom 	 s 	 	are	hyper	-	arousal	and	 memor 	 y 	 	 flash 	 back 	 s 	 	--	so	people	are	in	a	constant	fear	that	 t 	 hose 	 	 horr 	 ible 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	that	 trauma 	 tic 	 	event	might	come	back	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 ly 	 	,	 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	and	they	can	not	control	it	.
to	 compens 	 ate 	 	 th 	 is 	 	loss	of	inner	control	,	they	try	to	control	the	 out 	 side 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 understand 	 ably 	 	--	 most 	 ly 	 	the	family	--	and	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 fit 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	well	 in 	 to 	 	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	side	,	 regress 	 ive 	 	side	,	 repress 	 ive 	 	side	,	 restrict 	 ive 	 	side	of	the	cultural	 con 	 text 	 	.
so	,	 husband 	 s 	 	start	 beat 	 ing 	 	wives	,	 mother 	 s 	 	and	 father 	 s 	 	beat	 the 	 ir 	 	children	,	and	 after 	 ward 	 	,	they	feel	awful	.
they	did	not	want	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	it	just	 happen 	 ed 	 	--
they	lost	control	.
the	desperate	try	to	 re 	 store 	 	order	and	 normal 	 ity 	 	,	and	if	we	are	not	able	to	cut	 th 	 is 	 	circle	of	violence	,	it	will	be	 transfer 	 red 	 	to	the	next	generation	 with 	 out 	 	a	doubt	.
and	 part 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	 al 	 ready 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
so	 every 	 body 	 	 need 	 s 	 	a	sense	for	the	future	,
and	the	afghan	sense	of	the	future	is	 shatter 	 ed 	 	.
but	let	me	repeat	the	 word 	 s 	 	of	the	woman	.	``	 be 	 cause 	 	you	have	felt	me	,	i	can	feel	 my 	 self 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.	``
so	the	key	here	is	 empath 	 y 	 	.
 some 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	a	witness	to	what	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	you	.
 some 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	feel	how	you	felt	.
and	 some 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	see	you	and	listen	to	you	.
 every 	 body 	 	must	be	able	to	know	what	he	or	she	 ha 	 s 	 	 experience 	 d 	 	is	true	,
and	 th 	 is 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 go 	 es 	 	with	 an 	 other 	 	person	.
so	 every 	 body 	 	must	be	able	to	say	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	me	,	and	it	did	 th 	 is 	 	with	me	,	but	i	'm	able	to	live	with	it	,	to	cope	with	it	,	and	to	learn	from	it	.
and	i	want	to	engage	 my 	 self 	 	in	the	bright	future	for	my	children	and	the	children	of	my	children	,	and	i	will	not	marry	-	off	my	13	year	-	old	daughter	,	``	--	what	 happen 	 s 	 	too	often	in	afghanistan	.
so	 some 	 thing 	 	can	be	 d 	 one 	 	,	even	in	 s 	 uch 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 	 environment 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	afghanistan	.
and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	a	 counsel 	 ing 	 	program	.
but	,	of	course	,	i	 need 	 ed 	 	help	and	 fund 	 s 	 	.
and	one	 even 	 ing 	 	,	i	was	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	next	to	a	 ver 	 y 	 	nice	 gentle 	 man 	 	in	kabul	,	and	he	 ask 	 ed 	 	what	i	thought	would	be	good	in	afghanistan	.
and	i	 explain 	 ed 	 	to	him	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	i	would	train	psycho	-	social	 counsel 	 ors 	 	,	i	would	open	 center 	 s 	 	,	and	i	 explain 	 ed 	 	to	him	why	.
 th 	 is 	 	man	 g 	 ave 	 	me	his	contact	 detail 	 s 	 	at	the	end	of	the	 even 	 ing 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	if	you	want	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	call	me	.	``
at	that	time	,	it	was	the	head	of	caritas	germany	.
so	,	i	was	able	to	launch	a	three	-	year	project	with	caritas	germany	,	and	we	trained	30	afghan	women	and	men	,	and	we	 open 	 ed 	 	15	 counsel 	 ing 	 	 center 	 s 	 	in	kabul	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	our	sign	--	it	's	hand	-	 paint 	 ed 	 	,
and	we	had	45	all	over	kabul	.
eleven	thousand	people	came	--	more	than	that	.
and	70	percent	 regain 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	time	,	 develop 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	with	my	 wonder 	 ful 	 	afghan	team	.
and	they	are	 work 	 ing 	 	with	me	up	to	 to 	 day 	 	.
we	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	 cultural 	 ly 	 	-	sensitive	psycho	-	social	 counsel 	 ing 	 	approach	.
so	,	from	2008	up	 un 	 til 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	a	 sub 	 stantial 	 	change	and	step	forward	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	taking	place	.
the	european	 un 	 ion 	 	 deleg 	 ation 	 	in	kabul	came	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	and	 hire 	 d 	 	me	to	work	 in 	 side 	 	the	 mini 	 stry 	 	of	public	health	,	to	lobby	 th 	 is 	 	approach	--
we	 succeed 	 ed 	 	.
we	 revise 	 d 	 	the	mental	health	component	of	the	 prim 	 ary 	 	health	care	 service 	 s 	 	by	 add 	 ing 	 	psycho	-	social	care	and	psycho	-	social	 counsel 	 ors 	 	to	the	system	.
 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	,	 certain 	 ly 	 	,	to	 re 	 train 	 	all	health	staff	.
but	for	that	,	we	 al 	 ready 	 	have	the	training	 manual 	 s 	 	,	which	are	approved	by	the	 mini 	 stry 	 	and	 more 	 over 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	approach	is	now	part	of	the	mental	health	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	in	afghanistan	.
so	we	 al 	 so 	 	have	 implement 	 ed 	 	it	 al 	 ready 	 	in	some	 select 	 ed 	 	 clinic 	 s 	 	in	three	 pro 	 vince 	 s 	 	,	and	you	are	the	first	to	see	the	 result 	 s 	 	.
we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	know	if	what	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	is	effective	.
and	here	you	can	see	the	 patient 	 s 	 	all	had	 symptom 	 s 	 	of	 depress 	 ion 	 	,	moderate	and	severe	.
and	the	red	line	is	the	 treat 	 ment 	 	 a 	 s 	 	usual	--	 medic 	 ation 	 	with	a	medical	doctor	.
and	all	the	 symptom 	 s 	 	 stay 	 ed 	 	the	same	or	even	got	 wo 	 rse 	 	.
and	the	green	line	is	 treat 	 ment 	 	with	psycho	-	social	 counsel 	 ing 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	 medic 	 ation 	 	.
and	you	can	see	the	 symptom 	 s 	 	 al 	 most 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	go	away	,	and	the	psycho	-	social	stress	 ha 	 s 	 	 drop 	 ped 	 	 significant 	 ly 	 	,	which	is	explicable	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	can	not	take	away	the	psycho	-	social	 stress 	 es 	 	,	but	you	can	learn	how	to	cope	with	them	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 make 	 s 	 	us	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	,	 be 	 cause 	 	now	we	 al 	 so 	 	have	some	evidence	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	 work 	 ing 	 	.
so	here	you	see	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	health	 facil 	 ity 	 	in	 north 	 ern 	 	afghanistan	,	and	every	 morn 	 ing 	 	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	all	over	.
and	 doctor 	 s 	 	 usual 	 ly 	 	have	three	to	six	 minute 	 s 	 	for	the	 patient 	 s 	 	,
but	now	 th 	 is 	 	will	change	.
they	go	to	the	 clinic 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	want	to	cure	 the 	 ir 	 	 im 	 mediate 	 	 symptom 	 s 	 	,	and	they	will	find	 some 	 body 	 	to	talk	to	and	discuss	these	 issue 	 s 	 	and	talk	about	what	is	 burden 	 ing 	 	them	and	find	 solution 	 s 	 	,	develop	 the 	 ir 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	,	learn	 tool 	 s 	 	to	solve	 the 	 ir 	 	family	 conflict 	 s 	 	and	gain	some	confidence	in	the	future	.
and	i	would	like	to	share	one	short	vignette	.
one	hazara	 s 	 aid 	 	to	his	pashtun	 counsel 	 or 	 	,	``	if	we	 we 	 re 	 	to	have	met	some	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	then	we	would	have	 kill 	 ed 	 	each	other	.
and	now	you	are	 help 	 ing 	 	me	to	regain	some	confidence	in	the	future	.	``
and	 an 	 other 	 	 counsel 	 or 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	after	the	training	,	``	you	know	,	i	never	 k 	 new 	 	why	i	 surviv 	 ed 	 	the	 kill 	 ing 	 s 	 	in	my	village	,
but	now	i	know	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	am	part	of	a	nucleus	of	a	new	 peace 	 ful 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	in	afghanistan	.	``
so	i	 believ 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 ke 	 pt 	 	me	running	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 emancip 	 atory 	 	and	 politic 	 al 	 	 con 	 trib 	 ution 	 	to	peace	and	 reconcili 	 ation 	 	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	--	i	think	--	 with 	 out 	 	psycho	-	social	therapy	,	and	 with 	 out 	 	 consider 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	all	 human 	 itarian 	 	 project 	 s 	 	,	we	can	not	build	-	up	civil	 socie 	 ties 	 	.
i	thought	it	was	an	idea	worth	 spread 	 ing 	 	,	and	i	think	it	must	be	,	can	be	,	could	be	 replicate 	 d 	 	 else 	 where 	 	.
i	thank	you	for	your	attention	.
