i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 fascinate 	 d 	 	with	crop	 divers 	 ity 	 	for	about	35	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	,	ever	since	i	 s 	 tumble 	 d 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	a	 fair 	 ly 	 	 obscur 	 e 	 	academic	article	by	a	guy	named	jack	harlan	.
and	he	 de 	 scribed 	 	the	 divers 	 ity 	 	 with 	 in 	 	 crop 	 s 	 	--	all	the	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	wheat	and	rice	and	 s 	 uch 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	a	genetic	resource	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	genetic	resource	,	``	--	and	i	'll	never	forget	the	 word 	 s 	 	--	``	 stand 	 s 	 	between	us	and	 catastroph 	 ic 	 	 starv 	 ation 	 	on	a	scale	we	can	not	imagine	.	``	i	 figur 	 ed 	 	he	was	either	 re 	 ally 	 	on	to	 some 	 thing 	 	,	or	he	was	one	of	these	academic	nutcases	.
so	,	i	 look 	 ed 	 	a	little	further	,	and	what	i	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	was	that	he	was	n't	a	nutcase	.
he	was	the	most	 respect 	 ed 	 	scientist	in	the	field	.
what	he	 under 	 stood 	 	was	that	 bio 	 logical 	 	 divers 	 ity 	 	--	crop	 divers 	 ity 	 	--	is	the	 bio 	 logical 	 	 found 	 ation 	 	of	 agricultur 	 e 	 	.
it	's	the	raw	material	,	the	stuff	,	of	evolution	in	our	 agricultur 	 al 	 	 crop 	 s 	 	.
not	a	trivial	matter	.
and	he	 al 	 so 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	that	that	 found 	 ation 	 	was	 crumb 	 ling 	 	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	 crumb 	 ling 	 	.
that	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	a	mass	 extinct 	 ion 	 	was	 under 	 way 	 	in	our	 field 	 s 	 	,	in	our	 agricultur 	 al 	 	system	.
and	that	 th 	 is 	 	mass	 extinct 	 ion 	 	was	taking	place	with	 ver 	 y 	 	few	people	 not 	 ic 	 ing 	 	and	even	 few 	 er 	 	 car 	 ing 	 	.
now	,	i	know	that	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	do	n't	stop	to	think	about	 divers 	 ity 	 	in	 agricultur 	 al 	 	 system 	 s 	 	and	,	let	's	face	it	,	that	's	logical	.
you	do	n't	see	it	in	the	 news 	 paper 	 	every	day	.
and	when	you	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	 super 	 market 	 	,	you	 certain 	 ly 	 	do	n't	see	a	lot	of	 choice 	 s 	 	there	.
you	see	 apple 	 s 	 	that	are	red	,	yellow	,	and	green	and	that	's	about	it	.
so	,	let	me	show	you	a	picture	of	one	form	of	 divers 	 ity 	 	.
here	's	some	 bean 	 s 	 	,
and	there	are	about	35	or	40	different	 varie 	 ties 	 	of	 bean 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	picture	.
now	,	imagine	each	one	of	these	 varie 	 ties 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	distinct	from	 an 	 other 	 	about	the	same	way	 a 	 s 	 	a	 poo 	 d 	 le 	 	from	a	great	dane	.
if	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	show	you	a	picture	of	all	the	dog	 breed 	 s 	 	in	the	world	,	and	i	put	30	or	40	of	them	on	a	slide	,	it	would	take	about	10	 slide 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	there	about	400	 breed 	 s 	 	of	 dog 	 s 	 	in	the	world	.
but	there	are	35	to	40,000	different	 varie 	 ties 	 	of	 bean 	 s 	 	.
so	if	i	 we 	 re 	 	to	going	to	show	you	all	the	 bean 	 s 	 	in	the	world	,	and	i	had	a	slide	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	i	 s 	 witch 	 ed 	 	it	every	second	,	it	would	take	up	my	entire	ted	talk	,	and	i	would	n't	have	to	say	 any 	 thing 	 	.
but	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	 divers 	 ity 	 	--	and	the	tragic	thing	is	--	that	 th 	 is 	 	 divers 	 ity 	 	is	 be 	 ing 	 	lost	.
we	have	about	200,000	different	 varie 	 ties 	 	of	wheat	,	and	we	have	about	2	to	400,000	different	 varie 	 ties 	 	of	rice	,	but	it	's	 be 	 ing 	 	lost	.
and	i	want	to	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	that	.
it	's	a	bit	of	a	personal	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	in	fact	.
in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	in	the	1800s	--	that	's	where	we	have	the	best	data	--	 farm 	 ers 	 	and	 garden 	 ers 	 	 we 	 re 	 	growing	7,100	named	 varie 	 ties 	 	of	 apple 	 s 	 	.
imagine	that	.	7,100	 apple 	 s 	 	with	 name 	 s 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	6,800	of	 t 	 hose 	 	are	extinct	,
no	 long 	 er 	 	to	be	 s 	 een 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
i	used	to	have	a	list	of	these	extinct	 apple 	 s 	 	,
and	when	i	would	go	out	and	give	a	 present 	 ation 	 	,	i	would	pass	the	list	out	in	the	audience	.	i	would	n't	tell	them	what	it	was	,	but	it	was	in	 alpha 	 bet 	 ical 	 	order	,
and	i	would	tell	them	to	look	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 name 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	family	 name 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	mother	's	maiden	name	.
and	at	the	end	of	the	speech	,	i	would	ask	,	``	how	 man 	 y 	 	people	have	found	a	name	?	``	and	i	never	had	 few 	 er 	 	than	two	-	 third 	 s 	 	of	an	audience	hold	up	 the 	 ir 	 	hand	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	what	?	these	 apple 	 s 	 	come	from	your	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	,	and	your	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	them	the	 great 	 est 	 	honor	they	could	give	them	.	they	 g 	 ave 	 	them	 the 	 ir 	 	name	.
the	bad	news	is	they	're	extinct	.
the	good	news	is	a	third	of	you	did	n't	hold	up	your	hand	.	your	apple	's	still	out	there	.
find	it	.	make	 s 	 ure 	 	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	join	the	list	.	``
so	,	i	want	to	tell	you	that	the	piece	of	the	good	news	is	that	the	fowler	apple	is	still	out	there	.
and	there	's	an	old	book	back	here	,	and	i	want	to	read	a	piece	from	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	book	was	 publish 	 ed 	 	in	1904	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	 apple 	 s 	 	of	new	york	``	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	second	volume	.
see	,	we	used	to	have	a	lot	of	 apple 	 s 	 	.
and	the	fowler	apple	is	 de 	 scribed 	 	in	here	--	i	hope	 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	surprise	you	--	 a 	 s 	 	,	``	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	fruit	.	``
i	do	n't	know	if	we	named	the	apple	or	if	the	apple	named	us	,	but	...
but	,	to	be	honest	,	the	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	 go 	 es 	 	on	and	it	 say 	 s 	 	that	it	``	 do 	 es 	 	n't	rank	high	in	quality	,	 how 	 ever 	 	.	``
and	then	he	 ha 	 s 	 	to	go	even	further	.	it	 sound 	 s 	 	like	it	was	written	by	an	old	school	teacher	of	mine	.	``	 a 	 s 	 	grown	in	new	york	,	the	fruit	 usual 	 ly 	 	 fail 	 s 	 	to	develop	 proper 	 ly 	 	in	 s 	 ize 	 	and	quality	and	is	,	on	the	whole	,	 un 	 sati 	 s 	 factor 	 y 	 	.	``	and	i	guess	there	's	a	 less 	 on 	 	to	be	 learn 	 ed 	 	here	,	and	the	 less 	 on 	 	is	:	so	why	 s 	 ave 	 	it	?	i	get	 th 	 is 	 	question	all	the	time	.	why	do	n't	we	just	 s 	 ave 	 	the	best	one	?
and	there	are	a	couple	of	 answer 	 s 	 	to	that	question	.
one	thing	is	that	there	is	no	 s 	 uch 	 	thing	 a 	 s 	 	a	best	one	.
 to 	 day 	 	's	best	 varie 	 ty 	 	is	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	's	lunch	for	 insect 	 s 	 	or	 pest 	 s 	 	or	disease	.
the	other	thing	is	that	 may 	 be 	 	that	fowler	apple	or	 may 	 be 	 	a	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	wheat	that	's	not	 economic 	 al 	 	right	now	 ha 	 s 	 	disease	or	pest	 resist 	 ance 	 	or	some	quality	that	we	're	going	to	need	for	climate	change	that	the	 other 	 s 	 	do	n't	.
so	it	's	not	 necess 	 ary 	 	,	thank	god	,	that	the	fowler	apple	is	the	best	apple	in	the	world	.
it	's	just	 necess 	 ary 	 	or	 interest 	 ing 	 	that	it	might	have	one	good	,	 un 	 ique 	 	trait	.
and	for	that	reason	,	we	ought	to	be	saving	it	.
why	?	 a 	 s 	 	a	raw	material	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	trait	we	can	use	in	the	future	.
think	of	 divers 	 ity 	 	 a 	 s 	 	giving	us	 option 	 s 	 	.
and	 option 	 s 	 	,	of	course	,	are	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	we	need	in	an	era	of	climate	change	.
i	want	to	show	you	two	 slide 	 s 	 	,	but	first	,	i	want	to	tell	you	that	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	at	the	global	crop	 divers 	 ity 	 	trust	with	a	number	of	 scientist 	 s 	 	--	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	at	stanford	and	university	of	washington	--	to	ask	the	question	:	what	's	going	to	happen	to	 agricultur 	 e 	 	in	an	era	of	climate	change
and	what	kind	of	 trait 	 s 	 	and	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	do	we	need	in	our	 agricultur 	 al 	 	 crop 	 s 	 	to	be	able	to	adapt	to	 th 	 is 	 	?	in	short	,	the	answer	is	that	in	the	future	,	in	 man 	 y 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	the	 cold 	 est 	 	growing	 season 	 s 	 	are	going	to	be	 hot 	 ter 	 	than	 any 	 thing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 crop 	 s 	 	have	 s 	 een 	 	in	the	past	.
the	 cold 	 est 	 	growing	 season 	 s 	 	of	the	future	,	 hot 	 ter 	 	than	the	 hot 	 test 	 	of	the	past	.
is	 agricultur 	 e 	 	 adapt 	 ed 	 	to	that	?
i	do	n't	know	.	can	fish	play	the	piano	?
if	 agricultur 	 e 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 experience 	 d 	 	that	,	how	could	it	be	 adapt 	 ed 	 	?
now	,	the	highest	 concent 	 ration 	 	of	poor	and	 hung 	 ry 	 	people	in	the	world	,	and	the	place	where	climate	change	,	 iron 	 ically 	 	,	is	going	to	be	the	worst	is	in	south	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	and	sub	-	saharan	africa	.
so	i	've	 pick 	 ed 	 	two	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	here	,	and	i	want	to	show	you	.
in	the	 histo 	 gram 	 	before	you	now	,	the	blue	 bar 	 s 	 	represent	the	 historic 	 al 	 	range	of	 temperature 	 s 	 	,	going	back	about	far	 a 	 s 	 	we	have	temperature	data	.
and	you	can	see	that	there	's	some	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	one	growing	season	and	 an 	 other 	 	.
some	are	 cold 	 er 	 	,	some	are	 hot 	 ter 	 	and	it	's	a	bell	shaped	 curv 	 e 	 	.
the	 tall 	 est 	 	bar	is	the	average	temperature	for	the	most	number	of	growing	 season 	 s 	 	.
in	the	future	,	 lat 	 er 	 	 th 	 is 	 	century	,	it	's	going	to	look	like	the	red	,	 total 	 ly 	 	out	of	 bound 	 s 	 	.
the	 agricultur 	 al 	 	system	and	,	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	the	 crop 	 s 	 	in	the	field	in	india	have	never	 experience 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	before	.
here	's	south	africa	.	the	same	story	.
but	the	most	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	about	south	africa	is	we	do	n't	have	to	wait	for	2070	for	there	to	be	trouble	.
by	2030	,	if	the	 ma 	 ize 	 	,	or	corn	,	 varie 	 ties 	 	,	which	is	the	 domin 	 ant 	 	crop	--	50	percent	of	the	nutrition	in	southern	africa	are	still	in	the	field	--	in	2030	,	we	'll	have	a	30	percent	 de 	 crease 	 	in	production	of	 ma 	 ize 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	climate	change	 al 	 ready 	 	in	2030	.
30	percent	 de 	 crease 	 	of	production	in	the	 con 	 text 	 	of	increasing	population	,	that	's	a	food	crisis	.	it	's	global	in	nature	.
we	will	watch	children	 starv 	 e 	 	to	death	on	tv	.
now	,	you	may	say	that	20	 year 	 s 	 	is	a	long	way	off	.
it	's	two	 breed 	 ing 	 	 cycle 	 s 	 	for	 ma 	 ize 	 	.
we	have	two	 roll 	 s 	 	of	the	 d 	 ice 	 	to	get	 th 	 is 	 	right	.
we	have	to	get	climate	-	ready	 crop 	 s 	 	in	the	field	,	and	we	have	to	do	that	 ra 	 ther 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
now	,	the	good	news	is	that	we	have	 conserv 	 ed 	 	.	we	have	 collect 	 ed 	 	and	 conserv 	 ed 	 	a	great	deal	of	 bio 	 logical 	 	 divers 	 ity 	 	,	 agricultur 	 al 	 	 divers 	 ity 	 	,	 most 	 ly 	 	in	the	form	of	seed	,	and	we	put	it	in	seed	 bank 	 s 	 	,	which	is	a	 f 	 ancy 	 	way	of	 say 	 ing 	 	a	 freeze 	 r 	 	.
if	you	want	to	 conserv 	 e 	 	seed	for	a	long	term	and	you	want	to	make	it	 avail 	 able 	 	to	plant	 breed 	 ers 	 	and	 research 	 ers 	 	,	you	dry	it	and	then	you	freeze	it	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	these	seed	 bank 	 s 	 	are	 locate 	 d 	 	around	the	world	in	 building 	 s 	 	and	they	're	 vulner 	 able 	 	.
 disaster 	 s 	 	have	 happen 	 ed 	 	.	in	 re 	 cent 	 	 year 	 s 	 	we	lost	the	gene	bank	,	the	seed	bank	in	 ir 	 aq 	 	and	afghanistan	.	you	can	guess	why	.
in	rwanda	,	in	the	solomon	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	.
and	then	there	are	just	 dai 	 ly 	 	 disaster 	 s 	 	that	take	place	in	these	 building 	 s 	 	,	financial	 problem 	 s 	 	and	 mis 	 management 	 	and	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	 failure 	 s 	 	,	and	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	every	time	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	,	it	 mean 	 s 	 	 extinct 	 ion 	 	.	we	lose	 divers 	 ity 	 	.
and	i	'm	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	 divers 	 ity 	 	in	the	same	way	that	you	lose	your	car	 key 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	it	in	the	same	way	that	we	lost	the	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	:	 actual 	 ly 	 	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	it	,	never	to	be	 s 	 een 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
so	,	a	number	of	us	got	together	and	 decide 	 d 	 	that	,	you	know	,	 en 	 ough 	 	is	 en 	 ough 	 	and	we	need	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	that	and	we	need	to	have	a	 facil 	 ity 	 	that	can	 re 	 ally 	 	 off 	 er 	 	 protect 	 ion 	 	for	our	 bio 	 logical 	 	 divers 	 ity 	 	of	--	 may 	 be 	 	not	the	most	 charisma 	 tic 	 	 divers 	 ity 	 	.
you	do	n't	look	in	the	 eye 	 s 	 	of	a	carrot	seed	 quit 	 e 	 	in	the	way	you	do	a	 pan 	 da 	 	bear	,	but	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 divers 	 ity 	 	.
so	we	 need 	 ed 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	safe	place	,	and	we	went	 quit 	 e 	 	far	north	to	find	it	.
to	svalbard	,	in	fact	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	above	 main 	 land 	 	norway	.	you	can	see	greenland	there	.
that	's	at	78	 degree 	 s 	 	north	.
it	's	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	fly	on	a	 regular 	 ly 	 	 schedule 	 d 	 	 air 	 plane 	 	.
it	's	a	 remark 	 ably 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	.	i	ca	n't	even	begin	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	it	to	you	.
it	's	 other 	 world 	 ly 	 	,	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
we	 work 	 ed 	 	with	the	norwegian	government	and	with	the	norgen	,	the	norwegian	genetic	 resource 	 s 	 	program	,	to	design	 th 	 is 	 	 facil 	 ity 	 	.
what	you	see	is	an	artist	's	conception	of	 th 	 is 	 	 facil 	 ity 	 	,	which	is	built	in	a	mountain	in	svalbard	.
the	idea	of	svalbard	was	that	it	's	cold	,	so	we	get	natural	freezing	 temperature 	 s 	 	.
but	it	's	remote	.	it	's	remote	and	 access 	 ible 	 
so	it	's	safe	and	we	do	n't	depend	on	 mechanic 	 al 	 	 refrige 	 ration 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	more	than	just	an	artist	's	dream	,	it	's	now	a	 re 	 ality 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	next	picture	 show 	 s 	 	it	in	 con 	 text 	 	,	in	svalbard	.
and	here	's	the	front	door	of	 th 	 is 	 	 facil 	 ity 	 	.
when	you	open	up	the	front	door	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	you	're	looking	at	.	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	simple	.	it	's	a	hole	in	the	ground	.	it	's	a	tunnel	,	and	you	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	tunnel	,	 chisel 	 ed 	 	in	solid	rock	,	about	130	 meter 	 s 	 	.
there	are	now	a	couple	of	security	 door 	 s 	 	,	so	you	wo	n't	see	it	 quit 	 e 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	when	you	get	to	the	back	,	you	get	 in 	 to 	 	an	area	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	place	.
i	think	of	it	 a 	 s 	 	sort	of	a	 cat 	 hedral 	 	.
and	i	know	that	 th 	 is 	 	 tag 	 s 	 	me	 a 	 s 	 	a	bit	of	a	nerd	,	but	...
some	of	the	 hap 	 pies 	 t 	 	 day 	 s 	 	of	my	life	have	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 pent 	 	...
in	 th 	 is 	 	place	there	.
if	you	 we 	 re 	 	to	walk	 in 	 to 	 	one	of	these	rooms	,	you	would	see	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	's	not	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	,	but	if	you	know	what	's	there	,	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	 emotion 	 al 	 	.
we	have	now	about	425,000	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	 un 	 ique 	 	crop	 varie 	 ties 	 	.
there	's	70,000	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	different	 varie 	 ties 	 	of	rice	in	 th 	 is 	 	 facil 	 ity 	 	right	now	.
about	a	year	from	now	,	we	'll	have	over	half	a	million	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
we	're	going	up	to	over	a	million	,	and	 some 	 day 	 	we	'll	 bas 	 ically 	 	have	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	--	about	500	 seed 	 s 	 	--	of	every	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 agricultur 	 al 	 	crop	that	can	be	 store 	 d 	 	in	a	 froze 	 n 	 	state	in	 th 	 is 	 	 facil 	 ity 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 back 	 up 	 	system	for	world	 agricultur 	 e 	 	.	it	's	a	 back 	 up 	 	system	for	all	the	seed	 bank 	 s 	 	.	 s 	 to 	 rage 	 	is	free	.
it	 oper 	 ates 	 	like	a	 safe 	 ty 	 	deposit	box	.
norway	 own 	 s 	 	the	mountain	and	the	 facil 	 ity 	 	,	but	the	depositors	own	the	seed	.
and	if	 any 	 thing 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	,	then	they	can	come	back	and	get	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	picture	that	you	see	 show 	 s 	 	the	national	 collect 	 ion 	 	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	of	canada	,	and	an	 inter 	 national 	 	institution	from	syria	.
i	think	it	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	in	that	 th 	 is 	 	 facil 	 ity 	 	,	i	think	,	is	 al 	 most 	 	the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	i	can	think	of	these	 day 	 s 	 	where	 count 	 ries 	 	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	every	country	in	the	world	--	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	 seed 	 s 	 	from	every	country	in	the	world	--	all	the	 count 	 ries 	 	of	the	world	have	gotten	together	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	both	long	term	,	 sustain 	 able 	 	and	positive	.
i	ca	n't	think	of	 any 	 thing 	 	else	that	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	my	 life 	 time 	 	that	way	.
i	ca	n't	look	you	in	the	 eye 	 s 	 	and	tell	you	that	i	have	a	solution	for	climate	change	,	for	the	water	crisis	.
 agricultur 	 e 	 	 take 	 s 	 	70	percent	of	fresh	water	 suppli 	 es 	 	on	earth	.
i	ca	n't	look	you	in	the	 eye 	 s 	 	and	tell	you	that	there	is	 s 	 uch 	 	a	solution	for	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	or	the	energy	crisis	,	or	world	 hung 	 er 	 	,	or	peace	in	conflict	.
i	ca	n't	look	you	in	the	 eye 	 s 	 	and	tell	you	that	i	have	a	simple	solution	for	that	,	but	i	can	look	you	in	the	 eye 	 s 	 	and	tell	you	that	we	ca	n't	solve	any	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	if	we	do	n't	have	crop	 divers 	 ity 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	 challeng 	 e 	 	you	to	think	of	an	effective	,	efficient	,	 sustain 	 able 	 	solution	to	climate	change	if	we	do	n't	have	crop	 divers 	 ity 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	 quit 	 e 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	if	 agricultur 	 e 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	adapt	to	climate	change	,	 n 	 either 	 	will	we	.
and	if	 crop 	 s 	 	do	n't	adapt	to	climate	change	,	 n 	 either 	 	will	 agricultur 	 e 	 	,	 n 	 either 	 	will	we	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 some 	 thing 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	and	nice	to	do	.
there	are	a	lot	of	people	who	would	love	to	have	 th 	 is 	 	 divers 	 ity 	 	exist	just	for	the	 exist 	 ence 	 	value	of	it	.
it	is	,	i	agree	,	a	nice	thing	to	do	.
but	it	's	a	 necess 	 ary 	 	thing	to	do	.
so	,	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	real	sense	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	we	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	 inter 	 national 	 	community	,	should	get	 organize 	 d 	 	to	complete	the	task	.
the	svalbard	global	seed	vault	is	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	gift	that	norway	and	 other 	 s 	 	have	 give 	 n 	 	us	,	but	it	's	not	the	complete	answer	.
we	need	to	collect	the	 remain 	 ing 	 	 divers 	 ity 	 	that	's	out	there	.
we	need	to	put	it	 in 	 to 	 	good	seed	 bank 	 s 	 	that	can	 off 	 er 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 seed 	 s 	 	to	 research 	 ers 	 	in	the	future	.
we	need	to	catalog	it	.	it	's	a	library	of	life	,
but	right	now	i	would	say	we	do	n't	have	a	card	catalog	for	it	.
and	we	need	to	support	it	 financial 	 ly 	 	.
my	big	idea	would	be	that	while	we	think	of	it	 a 	 s 	 	 common 	 place 	 	to	endow	an	art	museum	or	endow	a	chair	at	a	university	,	we	 re 	 ally 	 	ought	to	be	 think 	 ing 	 	about	endowing	wheat	.
30	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	an	 end 	 ow 	 ment 	 	would	take	care	of	 pre 	 serv 	 ing 	 	all	the	 divers 	 ity 	 	in	wheat	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
so	we	need	to	be	 think 	 ing 	 	a	little	bit	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 term 	 s 	 	.
and	my	final	thought	is	that	we	,	of	course	,	by	 conserv 	 ing 	 	wheat	,	rice	,	 potato 	 es 	 	,	and	the	other	 crop 	 s 	 	,	we	may	,	 quit 	 e 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	,	end	up	saving	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
thank	you	.
