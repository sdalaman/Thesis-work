 some 	 time 	 s 	 	i	make	a	lot	of	 draw 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	i	still	do	n't	understand	what	it	is	i	'm	 draw 	 ing 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	are	 comfort 	 able 	 	with	digital	stuff	and	even	 s 	 mug 	 	about	that	relationship	might	be	 amuse 	 d 	 	to	know	that	the	guy	who	is	best	known	for	``	the	way	 thing 	 s 	 	work	,	``	while	 pre 	 par 	 ing 	 	for	part	of	a	 pan 	 el 	 	for	 call 	 ed 	 	 understand 	 ing 	 	,	 s 	 pent 	 	two	 day 	 s 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	his	 lap 	 top 	 	to	communicate	with	his	new	cd	 burn 	 er 	 	.
who	 k 	 new 	 	about	 extens 	 ion 	 	 manage 	 rs 	 	?
i	've	 al 	 ways 	 	 manage 	 d 	 	my	own	 extens 	 ions 	 
so	it	never	even	 occur 	 red 	 	to	me	to	read	the	 instruct 	 ions 	 	,
but	i	did	 final 	 ly 	 	figure	it	out	.	i	had	to	figure	it	out	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 a 	 long 	 	with	the	 invit 	 ation 	 	came	the	 frighten 	 ing 	 	 re 	 mind 	 er 	 	that	there	would	be	no	 project 	 or 	 	,
so	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 car 	 ous 	 el 	 s 	 	would	no	 long 	 er 	 	be	 necess 	 ary 	 	but	some	alternate	form	of	communication	would	.
now	,	i	could	talk	about	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	'm	known	for	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	would	be	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	appropriate	for	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	more	 technical 	 ly 	 	minded	people	here	,	or	i	could	talk	about	 some 	 thing 	 	i	 re 	 ally 	 	care	about	.
i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	go	with	the	 lat 	 ter 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	talk	about	rome	.
now	,	why	would	i	care	about	rome	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	?
well	,	i	went	to	rhode	 is 	 land 	 	school	of	design	in	the	second	half	of	the	'60s	to	 stud 	 y 	 	 architect 	 ure 	 	.
i	was	 luck 	 y 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	to	 s 	 pend 	 	my	last	year	,	my	fifth	year	,	in	rome	 a 	 s 	 	a	student	.	it	 change 	 d 	 	my	life	.
not	the	 l 	 east 	 	reason	was	the	fact	that	i	had	 s 	 pent 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	first	four	 year 	 s 	 	living	at	home	,	 driv 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	risd	 every 	 day 	 	,	 driv 	 ing 	 	back	.
i	 mis 	 s 	 ed 	 	the	'60s	.	i	read	about	them	;	i	understand	they	 we 	 re 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.	i	 mis 	 s 	 ed 	 	them	,
but	i	did	 s 	 pend 	 	that	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	year	in	rome	,
and	it	's	a	place	that	is	never	far	from	my	mind	.
so	,	 when 	 ever 	 	 give 	 n 	 	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	,	i	try	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	in	it	or	with	it	or	for	it	.
i	 al 	 so 	 	make	 draw 	 ing 	 s 	 	to	help	people	understand	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	want	them	to	 believ 	 e 	 	i	understand	.
and	that	's	what	i	do	 a 	 s 	 	an	 illustr 	 ator 	 	,
that	's	my	job	.
so	,	i	'm	going	to	show	you	some	 picture 	 s 	 	of	rome	.
i	've	made	a	lot	of	 draw 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	rome	over	the	 year 	 s 	 	.
these	are	just	 draw 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	rome	.	i	get	back	 a 	 s 	 	often	 a 	 s 	 	possible	--
i	need	to	.
all	different	 material 	 s 	 	,	all	different	 style 	 s 	 	,	all	different	 time 	 s 	 	,
 draw 	 ing 	 s 	 	from	 sketch 	 book 	 s 	 	looking	at	the	 detail 	 s 	 	of	rome	.
part	of	the	reason	i	'm	 show 	 ing 	 	you	these	is	that	it	sort	of	 help 	 s 	 	 illustr 	 ate 	 	 th 	 is 	 	process	i	go	through	of	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	what	it	is	i	feel	about	rome	and	why	i	feel	it	.
these	are	 sketch 	 es 	 	of	some	of	the	little	 detail 	 s 	 	.
rome	is	a	city	full	of	 surprise 	 s 	 	.
i	mean	,	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 un 	 usual 	 	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 s 	 	,
we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	narrow	little	 wind 	 ing 	 	 street 	 s 	 	that	 sudden 	 ly 	 	open	 in 	 to 	 	vast	,	 s 	 un 	 	-	 drench 	 ed 	 	 piazza 	 s 	 	--	never	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	 piazza 	 s 	 	that	are	not	 human 	 ly 	 	 scale 	 d 	 	.
part	of	the	reason	for	that	is	the	fact	that	they	grew	up	 organ 	 ically 	 	.
that	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 juxta 	 position 	 	of	old	and	new	,	the	bits	of	light	that	come	down	between	the	 building 	 s 	 	that	sort	of	create	a	map	that	's	 travel 	 ing 	 	above	your	head	of	 usual 	 ly 	 	blue	--	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	in	the	summer	--	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	the	map	that	you	would	 normal 	 ly 	 	expect	to	see	of	 convention 	 al 	 	 street 	 s 	 	.
and	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	think	about	how	i	could	communicate	 th 	 is 	 	in	book	form	.
how	could	i	share	my	sense	of	rome	,	my	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	rome	?
and	i	'm	going	to	show	you	a	bunch	of	dead	 end 	 s 	 	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	.
the	 prim 	 ary 	 	reason	for	all	these	dead	 end 	 s 	 	is	when	if	you	're	not	 quit 	 e 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	where	you	're	going	,	you	're	 certain 	 ly 	 	not	going	to	get	there	with	any	kind	of	efficiency	.
here	's	a	little	map	.	and	i	thought	of	 map 	 s 	 	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	;
 may 	 be 	 	i	should	just	try	and	do	a	little	atlas	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 street 	 s 	 	and	 connect 	 ions 	 	in	rome	.
and	here	's	a	line	of	text	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 evolve 	 s 	 	from	the	exhaust	of	a	 s 	 cooter 	 	 zip 	 ping 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	page	.
here	that	same	line	of	text	 wrap 	 s 	 	around	a	fountain	in	an	 illustr 	 ation 	 	that	can	be	 turn 	 ed 	 	 up 	 side 	 	down	and	read	both	ways	.
 may 	 be 	 	that	line	of	text	could	be	a	story	to	help	give	some	human	 a 	 spect 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	i	should	get	away	from	 th 	 is 	 	map	 complete 	 ly 	 	,	and	 re 	 ally 	 	be	honest	about	 want 	 ing 	 	to	show	you	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	bits	and	 piece 	 s 	 	of	rome
and	 simpl 	 y 	 	kick	a	soccer	ball	in	the	air	--	which	 happen 	 s 	 	in	so	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 square 	 s 	 	in	the	city	--	and	let	it	 bounc 	 e 	 	off	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.	and	i	'll	 simpl 	 y 	 	explain	what	each	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	is	that	the	soccer	ball	 hit 	 s 	 	.
that	 seem 	 ed 	 	like	a	sort	of	a	cheap	shot	.
but	even	 th 	 ough 	 	i	just	 start 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 present 	 ation 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	the	first	thing	that	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	do	and	i	was	 get 	 ting 	 	sort	of	desperate	.
 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	i	had	 re 	 ally 	 	no	content	that	i	could	count	on	,	so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	move	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 pack 	 aging 	 	.
i	mean	,	it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	work	for	a	lot	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
so	i	thought	a	little	box	set	of	four	small	 book 	 s 	 	might	do	the	trick	.
but	one	of	the	 idea 	 s 	 	that	 emerge 	 d 	 	from	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 sketch 	 es 	 	was	the	 not 	 ion 	 	of	 travel 	 ing 	 	through	rome	in	different	 vehicle 	 s 	 	at	different	 speed 	 s 	 	in	order	to	show	the	different	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	of	rome	.
sort	of	an	 over 	 view 	 	of	rome	and	the	plan	that	you	might	see	from	a	dirigible	.
quick	 snap 	 shot 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	you	might	see	from	a	 speed 	 ing 	 	motor	 s 	 cooter 	 	,	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 low 	 
 walk 	 ing 	 	through	rome	,	you	might	be	able	to	 stud 	 y 	 	in	more	detail	some	of	the	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 surface 	 s 	 	and	 what 	 not 	 	that	you	come	 a 	 cross 	 	.
 any 	 ways 	 	,	i	went	back	to	the	dirigible	 not 	 ion 	 	.	went	to	alberto	santos	-	dumont	.
found	one	of	his	 dirigible 	 s 	 	that	had	 en 	 ough 	 	 dimension 	 s 	 
so	i	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	use	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	scale	that	i	would	then	 juxta 	 pose 	 	with	some	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	in	rome	.
 th 	 is 	 	thing	would	be	 fly 	 ing 	 	over	or	past	or	be	 park 	 ed 	 	in	front	of	,	but	it	would	be	like	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	 rul 	 er 	 	--	sort	of	travel	through	the	 page 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 rul 	 er 	 	.
not	that	you	know	how	long	number	11	 actual 	 ly 	 	is	,	but	you	would	be	able	to	 compar 	 e 	 	number	11	against	the	 pan 	 the 	 on 	 	with	number	11	against	the	baths	of	caracalla	,	and	so	on	and	so	forth	.	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	beatrix	.	she	 ha 	 s 	 	a	dog	named	ajax	,
she	 ha 	 s 	 	 purchase 	 d 	 	a	dirigible	--	a	small	dirigible	--
she	's	 assem 	 bling 	 	the	structure	,
ajax	is	 sniff 	 ing 	 	for	 hole 	 s 	 	in	the	balloon	before	they	set	off	.
she	 launch 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	thing	above	the	spanish	 step 	 s 	 	and	 set 	 s 	 	off	for	an	 a 	 erial 	 	tour	of	the	city	.
over	the	spanish	 step 	 s 	 	we	go	.
a	nice	way	to	show	that	river	,	that	stream	sort	of	 pour 	 ing 	 	down	the	hill	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	just	 a 	 cross 	 	the	road	from	it	or	 quit 	 e 	 	close	by	is	the	column	of	marcus	aurelius	,
and	the	 dia 	 meter 	 	of	the	dirigible	 make 	 s 	 	an	impression	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	 a 	 s 	 	she	 start 	 s 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	read	the	story	that	 spiral 	 s 	 	around	the	column	of	marcus	aurelius	--	 get 	 s 	 	a	little	too	close	,	 nudge 	 s 	 	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	 give 	 s 	 	me	a	chance	to	suggest	to	you	the	structure	of	the	column	of	marcus	aurelius	,	which	is	 re 	 ally 	 	no	more	than	a	pile	of	 quarter 	 s 	 
high	--	thick	 quarter 	 s 	 	.	over	the	piazza	of	saint	ignacio	,	 complete 	 ly 	 	 ruin 	 ing 	 	the	symmetry	,	but	that	 a 	 side 	 	a	spectacular	place	to	visit	.
a	spectacular	 frame 	 work 	 	,	 in 	 side 	 	of	which	you	see	,	 usual 	 ly 	 	,	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	blue	sky	.
over	the	 pan 	 the 	 on 	 	and	the	26	-	foot	 dia 	 meter 	 	oculus	.
she	 park 	 s 	 	her	dirigible	,	 lower 	 s 	 	the	anchor	rope	and	 climb 	 s 	 	down	for	a	 close 	 r 	 	look	 in 	 side 	 	.
the	text	here	is	right	side	and	 up 	 side 	 	down	so	that	you	are	 force 	 d 	 	to	turn	the	book	around	,	and	you	can	see	it	from	ground	point	of	view	and	from	her	point	of	view	--	looking	in	the	hole	,	 get 	 ting 	 	a	different	kind	of	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	moving	you	around	the	space	.	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	appropriate	in	a	building	that	can	contain	 perfect 	 ly 	 	a	sphere	 dimension 	 s 	 	of	the	 dia 	 meter 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	the	same	 a 	 s 	 	the	distance	from	the	center	of	the	floor	to	the	center	of	the	oculus	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	for	her	,	the	anchor	line	 get 	 s 	 	 tangle 	 d 	 	around	the	feet	of	some	boy	 scout 	 s 	 	who	are	 visit 	 ing 	 	the	 pan 	 the 	 on 	 	,	and	they	are	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	 yank 	 ed 	 	out	and	 give 	 n 	 	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	but	 terrify 	 ing 	 	tour	of	some	of	the	 dom 	 es 	 	of	rome	,	which	would	,	from	 the 	 ir 	 	point	of	view	,	 natural 	 ly 	 	be	 hang 	 ing 	 	 up 	 side 	 	down	.
they	bail	out	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	they	get	to	the	top	of	saint	ivo	,	that	little	spiral	structure	you	see	there	.
she	 continu 	 es 	 	on	her	way	over	piazza	navona	.
 notice 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	activity	at	the	tre	scalini	restaurant	,	is	 re 	 minded 	 	that	it	is	 lunch 	 time 	 	and	she	's	 hung 	 ry 	 	.
they	keep	on	 motor 	 ing 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	campo	de	'	fiori	,	which	they	soon	reach	.	ajax	the	dog	is	put	in	a	basket	and	 lower 	 ed 	 	with	a	list	of	food	 in 	 to 	 	the	 market 	 place 	 	,
which	 flourish 	 es 	 	there	 un 	 til 	 	about	one	in	the	afternoon	,	and	then	is	 complete 	 ly 	 	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	and	 do 	 es 	 	n't	appear	 aga 	 in 	 	 un 	 til 	 	six	or	seven	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	the	pooch	 get 	 s 	 	back	to	the	dirigible	with	the	stuff	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	when	she	 go 	 es 	 	to	 un 	 wrap 	 	the	 pro 	 sciutto 	 	,	ajax	 make 	 s 	 	a	 lung 	 e 	 	for	it	.
she	's	 manage 	 d 	 	to	 s 	 ave 	 	the	 pro 	 sciutto 	 	,	but	in	the	process	she	 lose 	 s 	 	the	 table 	 cloth 	 	,	which	you	can	see	 fly 	 ing 	 	away	in	the	upper	left	-	hand	corner	.
they	 continu 	 e 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 table 	 cloth 	 	,	looking	for	a	place	to	land	 th 	 is 	 	thing	so	that	they	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	lunch	.
they	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	discover	a	huge	wall	that	's	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	small	 hole 	 s 	 	,	ideal	for	 dock 	 ing 	 	a	dirigible	 be 	 cause 	 	you	've	got	a	place	to	tie	up	.
 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	be	the	 ex 	 terior 	 	wall	--	that	part	of	it	that	 remain 	 s 	 	--	of	the	coliseum	,
so	they	park	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	there	and	have	a	 terr 	 ific 	 	lunch	and	have	a	spectacular	view	.
at	the	end	of	lunch	,	they	untie	the	anchor	,	they	set	off	through	the	baths	of	caracalla	and	over	the	 wall 	 s 	 	of	the	city	and	then	an	 abandon 	 ed 	 	 gate 	 house 	 
and	decide	to	take	one	more	look	at	the	pyramid	of	cestius	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 light 	 ning 	 	rod	on	top	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	that	's	a	problem	:	they	get	a	little	too	close	,	and	when	you	're	in	a	dirigible	you	have	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 care 	 ful 	 	about	 spike 	 s 	 	.
so	that	sort	of	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	her	little	story	to	a	 con 	 clusion 	 	.
marcello	,	on	the	other	hand	,	is	sort	of	a	 laz 	 y 	 	guy	,	but	he	's	not	due	at	work	 un 	 til 	 	about	noon	.
so	,	the	alarm	 go 	 es 	 	off	and	it	's	five	to	12	or	so	.
he	 get 	 s 	 	up	,	 leap 	 s 	 	onto	his	 s 	 cooter 	 	,	 race 	 s 	 	through	the	city	past	the	church	of	santa	maria	 d 	 ella 	 	pace	,	down	the	 al 	 ley 	 s 	 	,	through	the	 street 	 s 	 	that	 tourist 	 s 	 	may	be	 wander 	 ing 	 	through	,

so	they	all	have	his	number	.
he	 arriv 	 es 	 	at	the	 pala 	 zzo 	 	,	 arriv 	 es 	 	at	the	big	front	door	.
 enter 	 s 	 	the	 court 	 yard 	 	and	 talk 	 s 	 	to	the	custodian	,	who	 tell 	 s 	 	him	that	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	disaster	in	the	 pala 	 zzo 	 	;
 no 	 body 	 	's	tvs	are	 work 	 ing 	 
and	there	's	a	big	soccer	game	coming	up	,	and	the	crowd	is	 get 	 ting 	 	a	little	 rest 	 less 	 	and	a	little	nervous	.
he	 go 	 es 	 	down	to	the	 base 	 ment 	 	and	 start 	 s 	 	to	check	the	wiring	,	and	then	 gradu 	 ally 	 	 work 	 s 	 	his	way	up	to	the	top	of	the	building	,	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	by	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	,	 check 	 ing 	 	every	 tele 	 vision 	 	,	 check 	 ing 	 	every	 connect 	 ion 	 	,	 hop 	 ing 	 	to	find	out	what	 th 	 is 	 	problem	is	.
he	 work 	 s 	 	his	way	up	,	 final 	 ly 	 	,	the	grand	 stair 	 case 	 	and	then	a	 small 	 er 	 	 stair 	 case 	 	 un 	 til 	 	he	 reach 	 es 	 	the	 at 	 tic 	 	.
he	 open 	 s 	 	the	window	of	the	 at 	 tic 	 	,	of	course	,	and	there	's	a	 table 	 cloth 	 	 wrap 	 ped 	 	around	the	building	's	 tele 	 vision 	 	antenna	.
he	 re 	 move 	 s 	 	it	,	the	 problem 	 s 	 	are	 solve 	 d 	 	,	 every 	 body 	 	in	the	 pala 	 zzo 	 	is	happy	.
and	of	course	,	he	 al 	 so 	 	 solve 	 s 	 	his	own	problem	.
all	he	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	now	,	with	a	perfect	table	,	is	wait	for	her	to	 arriv 	 e 	 	.
that	was	the	first	attempt	,	but	it	did	n't	seem	 sub 	 stantial 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	to	convey	 what 	 ever 	 	it	was	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	convey	about	rome	.
so	i	thought	,	well	,	i	'll	just	do	 piazza 	 s 	 	,	and	i	'll	get	 in 	 side 	 	and	 under 	 neath 	 	and	i	'll	show	these	 thing 	 s 	 	growing	and	show	why	they	're	shaped	the	way	they	are	and	so	on	.
and	then	i	thought	,	that	's	too	 complic 	 ated 	 	.	no	,
i	'll	just	take	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	bits	and	 piece 	 s 	 	and	i	'll	put	them	 in 	 side 	 	the	 pan 	 the 	 on 	 	but	keep	the	scale	,
so	you	can	see	the	top	of	sant'ivo	and	the	pyramid	of	cestius	and	the	tempietto	of	bramante	all	side	by	side	in	 th 	 is 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	space	.
now	that	's	one	 draw 	 ing 	 	,
so	i	thought	 may 	 be 	 	it	's	time	for	piranesi	to	meet	escher	.
you	see	that	i	'm	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	 re 	 ally 	 	lose	control	here	and	 al 	 so 	 	hope	.
there	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	thin	blue	line	of	exhaust	that	sort	of	 run 	 s 	 	through	 th 	 is 	 	thing	that	would	be	kind	of	the	trail	that	 hold 	 s 	 	it	all	together	.
then	i	thought	,	``	wait	a	minute	,	what	am	i	 do 	 ing 	 	?	``
a	book	is	not	 on 	 ly 	 	a	neat	way	of	 collect 	 ing 	 	and	storing	information	,	it	's	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 layer 	 s 	 	.
i	mean	,	you	 al 	 ways 	 	peel	one	layer	off	 an 	 other 	 	;	we	think	of	them	 a 	 s 	 	 page 	 s 	 	,	 do 	 ing 	 	it	a	certain	way	.
but	think	of	them	 a 	 s 	 	 layer 	 s 	 	.	i	mean	,	rome	is	a	place	of	 layer 	 s 	 	--	 horizon 	 tal 	 	 layer 	 s 	 	,	 vert 	 ical 	 	 layer 	 s 	 	--
and	i	thought	,	well	just	 peel 	 ing 	 	off	a	page	would	allow	me	to	--	if	i	got	you	 think 	 ing 	 	about	it	the	right	way	--	would	allow	me	to	sort	of	show	you	the	depth	of	 layer 	 s 	 	.
the	stucco	on	the	 wall 	 s 	 	of	most	of	the	 building 	 s 	 	in	rome	 cover 	 s 	 	the	 scar 	 s 	 	;	the	 scar 	 s 	 	of	centuries	of	change	 a 	 s 	 	these	 structure 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 adapt 	 ed 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 be 	 ing 	 	torn	down	.
if	i	do	a	 fold 	 out 	 	page	on	the	left	-	hand	side	and	let	you	just	 un 	 fold 	 	it	,	you	see	 be 	 hind 	 	it	what	i	mean	by	scar	tissue	.
you	can	see	that	in	1635	,	it	 be 	 came 	 	essential	to	make	 small 	 er 	 	 window 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	bad	 guy 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	coming	or	 what 	 ever 	 	.
 adapt 	 ations 	 	all	get	buried	under	the	stucco	.
i	could	peel	out	a	page	of	 th 	 is 	 	 pala 	 zzo 	 	to	show	you	what	's	going	on	 in 	 side 	 	of	it	.
but	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	i	could	 al 	 so 	 	show	you	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	at	the	corner	of	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 magnific 	 ent 	 	 building 	 s 	 	with	all	the	massive	stone	 block 	 s 	 	,	or	the	fake	stone	 block 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	with	brick	and	stucco	,	which	is	more	often	the	case	.
so	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	three	-	dimensional	.
i	could	take	you	down	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	narrow	little	 street 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	surprising	 piazza 	 s 	 	by	using	a	double	gate	fold	--
double	 fold 	 out 	 	page	--	which	,	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	like	me	 read 	 ing 	 	a	pop	-	up	book	 a 	 s 	 	a	child	,	you	 hope 	 fully 	 	stick	your	head	 in 	 to 	 	.
you	wrap	the	 page 	 s 	 	around	your	head	and	are	in	that	piazza	for	that	brief	period	of	time	.
and	i	've	 re 	 ally 	 	not	 d 	 one 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	much	more	 complic 	 ated 	 	than	make	 fold 	 out 	 	 page 	 s 	 	.
but	then	i	thought	,	 may 	 be 	 	i	could	be	 simpl 	 er 	 	here	.
let	's	look	at	the	 pan 	 the 	 on 	 	and	the	piazza	 d 	 ella 	 	rotonda	in	front	of	it	.
here	's	a	book	 complete 	 ly 	 	wide	open	.
ok	,	if	i	do	n't	open	the	book	the	whole	way	,	if	i	just	open	it	90	 degree 	 s 	 	,	we	're	looking	down	the	front	of	the	 pan 	 the 	 on 	 	,
and	we	're	looking	sort	of	at	the	top	,	more	or	less	down	on	the	square	.
and	if	i	turn	the	book	the	other	way	,	we	're	looking	 a 	 cross 	 	the	square	at	the	front	of	the	 pan 	 the 	 on 	 	.
no	 fold 	 out 	 s 	 	,	no	 trick 	 s 	 	--	just	a	book	that	is	n't	open	the	whole	way	.
that	 seem 	 ed 	 	promising	.	i	thought	,	 may 	 be 	 	i	'll	do	it	 in 	 side 	 	and	i	can	even	combine	the	 fold 	 out 	 s 	 	with	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 partial 	 ly 	 	 open 	 ed 	 	book	.
so	we	get	 in 	 side 	 	the	 pan 	 the 	 on 	 	and	it	 grow 	 s 	 	and	so	on	and	so	forth	.
and	i	thought	,	 may 	 be 	 	i	'm	on	the	right	track	,	but	it	sort	of	lost	 it 	 s 	 	human	quality	.
so	i	went	back	to	the	 not 	 ion 	 	of	story	,	which	is	 al 	 ways 	 	a	good	thing	to	have	if	you	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	people	to	pay	attention	to	a	book	and	pick	up	information	 a 	 long 	 	the	way	.
``	pigeon	's	progress	``	 s 	 truck 	 	me	 a 	 s 	 	a	 catch 	 y 	 	title	.
if	it	was	a	 hom 	 ing 	 	pigeon	,	it	would	be	 call 	 ed 	 	``	homer	's	odyssey	.	``
but	it	was	the	journey	of	the	...
i	mean	,	if	a	title	 work 	 s 	 	,	use	it	.	but	it	would	be	a	journey	that	went	through	rome	and	 show 	 ed 	 	all	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	like	about	rome	.
it	's	a	pigeon	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	on	top	of	a	church	.
 go 	 es 	 	off	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	day	and	 do 	 es 	 	normal	pigeon	stuff	.	 come 	 s 	 	back	,	the	whole	place	is	 cover 	 ed 	 	with	 scaffold 	 ing 	 	and	green	 nett 	 ing 	 
and	there	's	no	way	 th 	 is 	 	pigeon	can	get	home	.	so	it	's	a	 home 	 less 	 	pigeon	now
and	it	's	going	to	have	to	find	 an 	 other 	 	place	to	live	,	and	that	 allow 	 s 	 	me	to	go	through	my	catalog	of	 favor 	 ite 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,
and	we	start	with	the	tall	 one 	 s 	 	and	so	on	.
 may 	 be 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	go	back	and	live	with	family	 member 	 s 	 	;
that	's	not	 al 	 ways 	 	a	good	thing	,	but	it	 do 	 es 	 	sort	of	 br 	 ing 	 	 pigeon 	 s 	 	together	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	i	thought	,	that	's	sort	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	but	 may 	 be 	 	there	's	a	person	who	should	be	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	in	some	way	.
so	i	kind	of	came	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	old	guy	who	 s 	 pend 	 s 	 	his	life	looking	after	sick	 pigeon 	 s 	 	.
he	'll	go	 any 	 where 	 	to	get	them	--	 danger 	 ous 	 	 place 	 s 	 	and	 what 	 not 	 	--
and	they	 be 	 come 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	guy	,	and	learn	to	do	 trick 	 s 	 	for	him	and	entertain	him	at	 lunch 	 time 	 	and	stuff	like	that	.
there	's	a	real	bond	that	 develop 	 s 	 	between	 th 	 is 	 	old	man	and	these	 pigeon 	 s 	 	.
but	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	he	 get 	 s 	 	sick	.	he	 get 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	sick	at	the	end	of	the	story	.
he	's	taught	them	to	spell	his	name	,	which	is	aldo	.
they	show	up	one	day	after	three	or	four	 day 	 s 	 	of	not	 see 	 ing 	 	him	--
he	 live 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	little	 gar 	 ret 	 	--
and	they	spell	his	name	and	fly	around	.
and	he	 final 	 ly 	 	 get 	 s 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	strength	together	to	climb	up	the	 lad 	 der 	 	onto	the	roof	,
and	all	the	 pigeon 	 s 	 	,	a	la	red	balloon	,	are	there	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	him	and	they	carry	him	off	over	the	 wall 	 s 	 	of	the	city	.
and	i	 for 	 got 	 	to	 ment 	 ion 	 	 th 	 is 	 	:	 when 	 ever 	 	he	lost	a	pigeon	,	he	would	take	that	pigeon	out	beyond	the	 wall 	 s 	 	of	the	city	.
in	the	old	roman	custom	,	the	dead	 we 	 re 	 	never	buried	 with 	 in 	 	the	 wall 	 s 	 	.
and	i	thought	that	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 cheer 	 y 	 	story	.	.	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	going	to	go	a	long	way	.
so	 any 	 way 	 	,	i	went	through	...	and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	if	 pack 	 aging 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	and	if	the	 st 	 ories 	 	are	n't	going	 any 	 where 	 	,	i	just	come	up	with	 title 	 s 	 
and	hope	that	a	title	will	sort	of	kick	me	off	in	the	right	direction	.
and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	it	 do 	 es 	 	focus	me	 en 	 ough 	 
and	i	'll	even	do	a	title	page	.
so	,	these	are	all	title	 page 	 s 	 	that	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	led	me	to	the	solution	i	 settl 	 ed 	 	on	,	which	is	the	story	of	a	young	woman	who	 s 	 end 	 s 	 	a	 mess 	 age 	 	on	a	 hom 	 ing 	 	pigeon	--	she	 live 	 s 	 	 out 	 side 	 	the	 wall 	 s 	 	of	the	city	of	rome	--	to	 some 	 one 	 	in	the	city	.
and	the	pigeon	is	 fly 	 ing 	 	down	above	the	appian	way	here	.
you	can	see	the	 tomb 	 s 	 	and	 pine 	 s 	 	and	so	on	and	so	forth	 a 	 long 	 	the	way	.
if	you	see	the	red	line	,	you	are	 see 	 ing 	 	the	trail	of	the	pigeon	;
if	you	do	n't	see	the	red	line	,	you	are	the	pigeon	.
and	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 necess 	 ary 	 	and	possible	,	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	to	try	to	convey	what	that	sense	would	be	like	of	 fly 	 ing 	 	over	the	city	 with 	 out 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	moving	.
past	the	pyramid	of	cestius	--	these	will	seem	 ver 	 y 	 	familiar	to	you	,	even	if	you	have	n't	 be 	 en 	 	to	rome	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	--
past	the	 gate 	 house 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	a	little	bit	 un 	 usual 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	pigeon	 do 	 es 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	most	 hom 	 ing 	 	 pigeon 	 s 	 	do	not	do	:	it	 take 	 s 	 	the	 scen 	 ic 	 	route	,	which	was	a	 de 	 vice 	 	that	i	felt	was	 necess 	 ary 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	extend	 th 	 is 	 	book	beyond	about	four	 page 	 s 	 	.
so	,	we	circle	around	the	coliseum	,	past	the	church	of	santa	maria	in	cosmedin	and	the	temple	of	hercules	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	river	.
we	 al 	 most 	 	collide	with	the	 corn 	 ice 	 	of	the	 pala 	 zzo 	 	farnese	--	designed	by	michelangelo	,	built	of	stone	taken	from	the	coliseum	--	narrow	 es 	 cape 	 	.
we	swoop	down	over	the	campo	de	'	fiori	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	i	show	to	my	 student 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	a	complete	 bastard 	 ization 	 	--	a	 deni 	 al 	 	of	any	 rule 	 s 	 	of	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	rule	of	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	that	i	think	 matter 	 s 	 	is	if	it	 look 	 s 	 	 believ 	 able 	 	,	you	've	 succeed 	 ed 	 	.
but	you	try	and	figure	out	where	the	 vanish 	 ing 	 	 point 	 s 	 	meet	here	;
a	couple	are	on	mars	and	a	couple	of	 other 	 s 	 	in	cremona	.
but	 in 	 to 	 	the	piazza	in	front	of	santa	maria	 d 	 ella 	 	pace	,	where	 in 	 vari 	 ably 	 	a	soccer	game	is	going	on	,	and	we	're	hit	by	a	soccer	ball	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	 illustr 	 ation 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	hit	by	a	soccer	ball	.
i	have	all	the	 piece 	 s 	 	:	there	's	santa	maria	 d 	 ella 	 	pace	,	there	's	a	soccer	ball	,	there	's	a	little	bit	of	a	bird	's	wing	--	 noth 	 ing 	 	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	,
so	i	had	to	 re 	 think 	 	it	.
and	if	you	do	want	to	see	santa	maria	 d 	 ella 	 	pace	,	these	 book 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 flex 	 ible 	 	,	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 inter 	 active 	 	--	just	turn	it	around	and	look	at	it	the	other	way	.
through	the	 al 	 ley 	 	,	we	can	see	the	impact	is	 capture 	 d 	 	in	the	red	line	.
and	then	bird	 manage 	 s 	 	to	pull	 it 	 self 	 	together	past	 th 	 is 	 	 med 	 ieval 	 	tower	--	one	of	the	few	 remain 	 ing 	 	 med 	 ieval 	 	 tower 	 s 	 	--	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	church	of	sant'agnese	and	around	the	 dom 	 e 	 	looking	down	 in 	 to 	 	piazza	navona	--	which	we	've	 al 	 ready 	 	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	and	 s 	 een 	 	and	 flow 	 n 	 	over	a	couple	of	 time 	 s 	 	;	there	's	the	bernini	statue	of	the	four	 river 	 s 	 	--
and	then	past	the	 wonder 	 ful 	 	borromini	sant'ivo	,
 stop 	 ping 	 	just	long	 en 	 ough 	 	on	the	26	-	foot	 dia 	 meter 	 	oculus	of	the	 pan 	 the 	 on 	 	to	catch	our	breath	.
and	then	we	can	swoop	 in 	 side 	 	and	around	;	and	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	 fly 	 ing 	 	,	we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	have	to	worry	about	 gravit 	 y 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	moment	in	time	,
so	 th 	 is 	 	 draw 	 ing 	 	can	be	oriented	in	any	way	on	the	page	.
we	get	a	little	 ex 	 uber 	 ant 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	pass	gesu	;	it	's	not	surprising	to	sort	of	mimic	the	 architect 	 ure 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
past	the	 wonder 	 ful 	 	wall	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	the	 juxta 	 position 	 	that	i	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	;	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 carv 	 ing 	 s 	 	set	 in 	 to 	 	the	 wall 	 s 	 	above	the	 ne 	 on 	 	``	ristorante	``	sign	,	and	so	on	.
and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	we	 arriv 	 e 	 	at	the	 court 	 yard 	 	of	the	 pala 	 zzo 	 	,	which	is	our	destination	.
straight	up	through	the	 court 	 yard 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	little	window	 in 	 to 	 	the	 at 	 tic 	 	,	where	 some 	 body 	 	is	 work 	 ing 	 	at	the	 draw 	 ing 	 	board	.

 a 	 s 	 	we	look	at	the	 draw 	 ing 	 	board	,	we	see	what	he	's	 work 	 ing 	 	on	is	,	in	fact	,	a	map	of	the	journey	that	the	pigeon	 ha 	 s 	 	just	taken	,	and	the	red	line	 extend 	 s 	 	through	all	the	 sight 	 s 	 	.
