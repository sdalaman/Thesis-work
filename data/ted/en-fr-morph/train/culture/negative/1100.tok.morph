thank	you	.

thank	you	.
all	right	,	so	i	want	you	to	take	a	moment	,	and	i	want	you	to	think	of	three	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	know	to	be	true	.
they	can	be	about	 what 	 ever 	 	you	want	--	technology	,	 entertain 	 ment 	 	,	design	,	your	family	,	what	you	had	for	 break 	 fast 	 	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	rule	is	do	n't	think	too	hard	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	ready	?	go	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
so	here	are	three	 thing 	 s 	 	i	know	to	be	true	.
i	know	that	jean	-	luc	godard	was	right	when	he	 s 	 aid 	 	that	,	``	a	good	story	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	a	middle	and	an	end	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	in	that	order	.	``
i	know	that	i	'm	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	nervous	and	 excit 	 ed 	 	to	be	up	here	,	which	is	 great 	 ly 	 	 inhibit 	 ing 	 	my	ability	to	keep	it	cool	.
and	i	know	that	i	have	 be 	 en 	 	 wait 	 ing 	 	all	week	to	tell	 th 	 is 	 	joke	.
why	was	the	 s 	 care 	 crow 	 	 invit 	 ed 	 	to	ted	?
 be 	 cause 	 	he	was	out	 stand 	 ing 	 	in	his	field	.
i	'm	sorry	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	these	are	three	 thing 	 s 	 	i	know	to	be	true	.
but	there	are	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	i	have	trouble	 understand 	 ing 	 	.
so	i	write	 poem 	 s 	 	to	figure	 thing 	 s 	 	out	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	i	know	how	to	work	through	 some 	 thing 	 	is	by	writing	a	poem	.
and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	i	get	to	the	end	of	the	poem	and	look	back	and	go	,	``	oh	,	that	's	what	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	about	,	``
and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	i	get	to	the	end	of	the	poem	and	have	n't	 solve 	 d 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	,	but	at	 l 	 east 	 	i	have	a	new	poem	out	of	it	.
spoken	word	 poet 	 ry 	 	is	the	art	of	performance	 poet 	 ry 	 	.
i	tell	people	it	 involve 	 s 	 	creating	 poet 	 ry 	 	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	just	want	to	 s 	 it 	 	on	paper	,	that	 some 	 thing 	 	about	it	 demand 	 s 	 	it	be	heard	out	loud	or	 witness 	 ed 	 	in	person	.
when	i	was	a	 fresh 	 man 	 	in	high	school	,	i	was	a	live	wire	of	nervous	 hormone 	 s 	 	.
and	i	was	 under 	 develop 	 ed 	 	and	over	-	 excit 	 able 	 	.
and	 de 	 spite 	 	my	fear	of	ever	 be 	 ing 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	at	for	too	long	,	i	was	 fascinate 	 d 	 	by	the	idea	of	spoken	word	 poet 	 ry 	 	.
i	felt	that	my	two	secret	 love 	 s 	 	,	 poet 	 ry 	 	and	theatre	,	had	come	together	,	had	a	baby	,	a	baby	i	 need 	 ed 	 	to	get	to	know	.
so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	give	it	a	try	.
my	first	spoken	word	poem	,	 pack 	 ed 	 	with	all	the	 wis 	 dom 	 	of	a	14	-	year	-	old	,	was	about	the	 in 	 justice 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 een 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 un 	 femin 	 ine 	 	.
the	poem	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 in 	 dig 	 nant 	 	,	and	 main 	 ly 	 	 exagge 	 rated 	 	,	but	the	 on 	 ly 	 	spoken	word	 poet 	 ry 	 	that	i	had	 s 	 een 	 	up	 un 	 til 	 	that	point	was	 main 	 ly 	 	 in 	 dig 	 nant 	 	,	so	i	thought	that	that	's	what	was	 expect 	 ed 	 	of	me	.
the	first	time	that	i	 perform 	 ed 	 	,	the	audience	of	 teenager 	 s 	 	 hoo 	 ted 	 	and	 holler 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 sympath 	 y 	 	,	and	when	i	came	off	the	stage	i	was	 sha 	 king 	 	.
i	felt	 th 	 is 	 	tap	on	my	shoulder	,	and	i	 turn 	 ed 	 	around	to	see	 th 	 is 	 	giant	girl	in	a	 hood 	 ie 	 	 sweat 	 shirt 	 	emerge	from	the	crowd	.
she	was	 may 	 be 	 	eight	feet	tall	and	 look 	 ed 	 	like	she	could	beat	me	up	with	one	hand	,	but	 in 	 stead 	 	she	just	 nod 	 d 	 ed 	 	at	me	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	i	 re 	 ally 	 	felt	that	.	 thank 	 s 	 	.	``
and	 light 	 ning 	 	 s 	 truck 	 	.
i	was	 hook 	 ed 	 	.
i	 discover 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	bar	on	manhattan	's	lower	east	side	that	 host 	 ed 	 	a	 week 	 ly 	 	 poet 	 ry 	 	open	mic	,	and	my	 be 	 wild 	 er 	 ed 	 	,	but	 support 	 ive 	 	,	 parent 	 s 	 	took	me	to	soak	in	every	ounce	of	spoken	word	that	i	could	.
i	was	the	 young 	 est 	 	by	at	 l 	 east 	 	a	decade	,	but	 some 	 how 	 	the	 poet 	 s 	 	at	the	bowery	 poet 	 ry 	 	club	did	n't	seem	 both 	 er 	 ed 	 	by	the	14	-	year	-	old	 wander 	 ing 	 	about	--	if	fact	,	they	 welcome 	 d 	 	me	.
and	it	was	here	,	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	these	 poet 	 s 	 	share	 the 	 ir 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	,	that	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	spoken	word	 poet 	 ry 	 	did	n't	have	to	be	 in 	 dig 	 nant 	 	,	it	could	be	 f 	 un 	 	or	 pain 	 ful 	 	or	serious	or	 s 	 il 	 ly 	 	.
the	bowery	 poet 	 ry 	 	club	 be 	 came 	 	my	 class 	 room 	 	and	my	home	,
and	the	 poet 	 s 	 	who	 perform 	 ed 	 	 encourag 	 ed 	 	me	to	share	my	 st 	 ories 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
never	mind	the	fact	that	i	was	14	--	they	told	me	,	``	write	about	 be 	 ing 	 	14.	``
so	i	did	and	stood	 amaz 	 ed 	 	every	week	when	these	 brilli 	 ant 	 	,	grown	-	up	 poet 	 s 	 	 laugh 	 ed 	 	with	me	and	 groan 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 sympath 	 y 	 	and	 clap 	 ped 	 	and	told	me	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	i	 re 	 ally 	 	felt	that	too	.	``
now	i	can	divide	my	spoken	word	journey	 in 	 to 	 	three	 step 	 s 	 	.
step	one	was	the	moment	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	can	.	i	can	do	 th 	 is 	 	.	``
and	that	was	 thank 	 s 	 	to	a	girl	in	a	 hood 	 ie 	 	.
step	two	was	the	moment	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	will	.	i	will	 continu 	 e 	 	.
i	love	spoken	word	.	i	will	keep	coming	back	week	after	week	.	``
and	step	three	 beg 	 an 	 	when	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	i	did	n't	have	to	write	 poem 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 in 	 dig 	 nant 	 	,	if	that	's	not	what	i	was	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	specific	to	me	,	and	the	more	that	i	focused	on	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	the	 weird 	 er 	 	my	 poet 	 ry 	 	got	,	but	the	more	that	it	felt	like	mine	.
it	's	not	just	the	 ad 	 age 	 	``	write	what	you	know	.	``	it	's	about	 gather 	 ing 	 	up	all	of	the	knowledge	and	experience	you	've	 collect 	 ed 	 	up	to	now	to	help	you	 d 	 ive 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 thing 	 s 	 	you	do	n't	know	.
i	use	 poet 	 ry 	 	to	help	me	work	through	what	i	do	n't	understand	,	but	i	show	up	to	each	new	poem	with	a	 back 	 pack 	 	full	of	 every 	 where 	 	else	that	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	.
when	i	got	to	university	,	i	met	a	fellow	poet	who	 share 	 d 	 	my	belief	in	the	magic	of	spoken	word	 poet 	 ry 	 	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	phil	kaye	and	i	 co 	 incident 	 ally 	 	 al 	 so 	 	share	the	same	last	name	.
when	i	was	in	high	school	i	had	 create 	 d 	 	project	v.o.i.c.e	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	way	to	 encourag 	 e 	 	my	 friend 	 s 	 	to	do	spoken	word	with	me	.
but	phil	and	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	 re 	 invent 	 	project	v.o.i.c.e	.	--	 th 	 is 	 	time	changing	the	mission	to	using	spoken	word	 poet 	 ry 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	way	to	entertain	,	 educ 	 ate 	 	and	inspire	.
we	 stay 	 ed 	 	full	-	time	 student 	 s 	 	,	but	in	between	we	 travel 	 ed 	 	,	 perform 	 ing 	 	and	 teach 	 ing 	 	nine	-	year	-	olds	to	mfa	 candid 	 ates 	 	,	from	california	to	indiana	to	india	to	a	public	high	school	just	up	the	street	from	campus	.
and	we	saw	over	and	over	the	way	that	spoken	word	 poet 	 ry 	 	 crack 	 s 	 	open	 lock 	 s 	 	.
but	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	 poet 	 ry 	 	can	be	 re 	 ally 	 	 scar 	 y 	 	.
 turn 	 s 	 	out	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	you	have	to	trick	 teenager 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	writing	 poet 	 ry 	 	.
so	i	came	up	with	 list 	 s 	 	.	 every 	 one 	 	can	write	 list 	 s 	 	.
and	the	first	list	that	i	assign	is	``	10	 thing 	 s 	 	i	know	to	be	true	.	``
and	here	's	what	 happen 	 s 	 	,	and	here	's	what	you	would	discover	too	if	we	all	 start 	 ed 	 	sharing	our	 list 	 s 	 	out	loud	.
at	a	certain	point	,	you	would	 real 	 ize 	 	that	 some 	 one 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	the	exact	same	thing	,	or	one	thing	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	,	to	 some 	 thing 	 	on	your	list	.
and	then	 some 	 one 	 	else	 ha 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	the	complete	 oppos 	 ite 	 	of	 your 	 s 	 	.
third	,	 some 	 one 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	you	've	never	even	heard	of	before	.
and	fourth	,	 some 	 one 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	you	thought	you	 k 	 new 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	about	,	but	they	're	 introduc 	 ing 	 	a	new	angle	of	looking	at	it	.
and	i	tell	people	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	great	 st 	 ories 	 	start	from	--	these	four	 intersect 	 ions 	 	of	what	you	're	passionate	about	and	what	 other 	 s 	 	might	be	 invest 	 ed 	 	in	.
and	most	people	respond	 re 	 ally 	 	well	to	 th 	 is 	 	 exercis 	 e 	 	.
but	one	of	my	 student 	 s 	 	,	a	 fresh 	 man 	 	named	charlotte	,	was	not	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	.
charlotte	was	 ver 	 y 	 	good	at	writing	 list 	 s 	 	,	but	she	 re 	 fused 	 	to	write	any	 poem 	 s 	 	.
``	 mis 	 s 	 	,	``	she	'd	say	,	``	i	'm	just	not	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
i	do	n't	have	 any 	 thing 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	say	.	``
so	i	 assign 	 ed 	 	her	list	after	list	,	and	one	day	i	 assign 	 ed 	 	the	list	``	10	 thing 	 s 	 	i	should	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	by	now	.	``
number	three	on	charlotte	's	list	was	,	``	i	should	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	not	to	crush	on	 guy 	 s 	 	three	 time 	 s 	 	my	age	.	``
i	 ask 	 ed 	 	her	what	that	 me 	 ant 	 	,	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 mis 	 s 	 	,	it	's	kind	of	a	long	story	.	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	charlotte	,	it	 sound 	 s 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	me	.	``
and	so	she	wrote	her	first	poem	,	a	love	poem	 un 	 like 	 	any	i	had	ever	heard	before	.
and	the	poem	 beg 	 an 	 	,	``	anderson	cooper	is	a	 gorge 	 ous 	 	man	.	``
``	did	you	see	him	on	60	 minute 	 s 	 	,	 rac 	 ing 	 	michael	phelps	in	a	pool	--	 noth 	 ing 	 	but	swim	 trunk 	 s 	 	on	--	 div 	 ing 	 	in	the	water	,	 determine 	 d 	 	to	beat	 th 	 is 	 	 swimm 	 ing 	 	champion	?

now	i	know	that	the	number	one	rule	to	 be 	 ing 	 	cool	is	to	seem	 un 	 fazed 	 	,	to	never	admit	that	 any 	 thing 	 	 s 	 care 	 s 	 	you	or	 impress 	 es 	 	you	or	 excit 	 es 	 	you	.

i	use	spoken	word	to	help	my	 student 	 s 	 	 re 	 discover 	 	wonder	,	to	fight	 the 	 ir 	 	 instinct 	 s 	 	to	be	cool	and	 un 	 fazed 	 	and	,	 in 	 stead 	 	,	 active 	 ly 	 	pursue	 be 	 ing 	 	 engag 	 ed 	 	with	what	 go 	 es 	 	on	around	them	,	so	that	they	can	 re 	 interpret 	 	and	create	 some 	 thing 	 	from	it	.
it	's	not	that	i	think	that	spoken	word	 poet 	 ry 	 	is	the	ideal	art	form	.
i	'm	 al 	 ways 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	find	the	best	way	to	tell	each	story	.
i	write	 musical 	 s 	 	;	i	make	short	 film 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 side 	 	my	 poem 	 s 	 	.
but	i	teach	spoken	word	 poet 	 ry 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 access 	 ible 	 	.
not	 every 	 one 	 	can	read	music	or	 own 	 s 	 	a	camera	,	but	 every 	 one 	 	can	communicate	in	some	way	,	and	 every 	 one 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	that	the	rest	of	us	can	learn	from	.
plus	,	spoken	word	 poet 	 ry 	 	 allow 	 s 	 	for	 im 	 mediate 	 	 connect 	 ions 	 	.
it	's	not	 un 	 common 	 	for	people	to	feel	like	they	're	 al 	 one 	 	or	that	 no 	 body 	 	 understand 	 s 	 	them	,	but	spoken	word	 teach 	 es 	 	that	if	you	have	the	ability	to	express	 your 	 self 	 	and	the	courage	to	present	 t 	 hose 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	and	 opinion 	 s 	 	,	you	could	be	 reward 	 ed 	 	with	a	room	full	of	your	 peer 	 s 	 	,	or	your	community	,	who	will	listen	.
and	 may 	 be 	 	even	a	giant	girl	in	a	 hood 	 ie 	 	will	connect	with	what	you	've	 share 	 d 	 	.
and	that	is	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 real 	 ization 	 	to	have	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	when	you	're	14	.
plus	,	now	with	youtube	,	that	 connect 	 ion 	 	's	not	even	 limit 	 ed 	 	to	the	room	we	're	in	.
i	'm	so	 luck 	 y 	 	that	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	 archiv 	 e 	 	of	 performance 	 s 	 	that	i	can	share	with	my	 student 	 s 	 	.
it	 allow 	 s 	 	for	even	more	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	for	them	to	find	a	poet	or	a	poem	that	they	connect	to	.
it	is	 tempt 	 ing 	 	--	once	you	've	 figur 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	out	--	it	is	 tempt 	 ing 	 	to	keep	writing	the	same	poem	,	or	keep	 tell 	 ing 	 	the	same	story	,	over	and	over	,	once	you	've	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	that	it	will	gain	you	 app 	 laus 	 e 	 	.
it	's	not	 en 	 ough 	 	to	just	teach	that	you	can	express	 your 	 self 	 	.	you	have	to	grow	and	explore	and	take	 risk 	 s 	 	and	 challeng 	 e 	 	 your 	 self 	 	.
and	that	is	step	three	:	 in 	 fusing 	 	the	work	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	with	the	specific	 thing 	 s 	 	that	make	you	you	,	even	while	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 ways 	 	changing	.
 be 	 cause 	 	step	three	never	 end 	 s 	 	.
but	you	do	n't	get	to	start	on	step	three	,	 un 	 til 	 	you	take	step	one	first	:	i	can	.
i	travel	a	lot	while	i	'm	 teach 	 ing 	 	,	and	i	do	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	get	to	watch	all	of	my	 student 	 s 	 	reach	 the 	 ir 	 	step	three	,	but	i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	with	charlotte	,	that	i	got	to	watch	her	journey	 un 	 fold 	 	the	way	it	did	.
i	 watch 	 ed 	 	her	 real 	 ize 	 	that	,	by	 put 	 ting 	 	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	she	 know 	 s 	 	to	be	true	 in 	 to 	 	the	work	she	's	 do 	 ing 	 	,	she	can	create	 poem 	 s 	 	that	 on 	 ly 	 	charlotte	can	write	--	about	 eye 	 ball 	 s 	 	and	 elev 	 ators 	 	and	dora	the	 explore 	 r 	 	.
and	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	tell	 st 	 ories 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	i	can	tell	--	like	 th 	 is 	 	story	.
i	 s 	 pent 	 	a	lot	of	time	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	best	way	to	tell	 th 	 is 	 	story	,	and	i	 wonder 	 ed 	 	if	the	best	way	was	going	to	be	a	powerpoint	or	a	short	film	--	and	where	 exact 	 ly 	 	was	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	or	the	middle	or	the	end	?
and	i	 wonder 	 ed 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	i	'd	get	to	the	end	of	 th 	 is 	 	talk	and	 final 	 ly 	 	have	 figur 	 ed 	 	it	all	out	,	or	not	.
and	i	 al 	 ways 	 	thought	that	my	 begin 	 ning 	 	was	at	the	bowery	 poet 	 ry 	 	club	,	but	it	's	possible	that	it	was	much	 ear 	 lier 	 	.
in	 pre 	 par 	 ing 	 	for	ted	,	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 di 	 ary 	 	page	in	an	old	journal	.
i	think	december	54th	was	 prob 	 ably 	 	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	24th	.
it	's	clear	that	when	i	was	a	child	,	i	 definite 	 ly 	 	 walk 	 ed 	 	through	life	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	think	that	we	all	did	.
i	would	like	to	help	 other 	 s 	 	 re 	 discover 	 	that	wonder	--	to	want	to	engage	with	it	,	to	want	to	learn	,	to	want	to	share	what	they	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	,	what	they	've	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	true	and	what	they	're	still	 figur 	 ing 	 	out	.
so	i	'd	like	to	close	with	 th 	 is 	 	poem	.
when	they	 bomb 	 ed 	 	hiroshima	,	the	explosion	 form 	 ed 	 	a	mini	-	supernova	so	every	living	animal	,	human	or	plant	that	 receiv 	 ed 	 	direct	contact	with	the	 ray 	 s 	 	from	that	 s 	 un 	 	was	 instant 	 ly 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	to	ash	.
and	what	was	left	of	the	city	soon	 follow 	 ed 	 	.
the	long	-	 last 	 ing 	 	damage	of	nuclear	 radi 	 ation 	 	 caus 	 ed 	 	an	entire	city	and	 it 	 s 	 	population	to	turn	 in 	 to 	 	powder	.
when	i	was	born	,	my	mom	 say 	 s 	 	i	 look 	 ed 	 	around	the	whole	hospital	room	with	a	 star 	 e 	 	that	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	?	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	before	.	``
she	 say 	 s 	 	i	have	old	 eye 	 s 	 	.
when	my	grandpa	genji	 di 	 ed 	 	,	i	was	 on 	 ly 	 	five	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	but	i	took	my	mom	by	the	hand	and	told	her	,	``	do	n't	worry	,	he	'll	come	back	 a 	 s 	 	a	baby	.	``
and	yet	,	for	 some 	 one 	 	who	's	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	,	i	still	have	n't	 figur 	 ed 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	out	yet	.
my	 knee 	 s 	 	still	 buck 	 le 	 	every	time	i	get	on	a	stage	.
my	self	-	confidence	can	be	 measur 	 ed 	 	out	in	 teas 	 poons 	 	 mix 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	my	 poet 	 ry 	 	,	and	it	still	 al 	 ways 	 	 taste 	 s 	 	funny	in	my	mouth	.
but	in	hiroshima	,	some	people	 we 	 re 	 	 wipe 	 d 	 	clean	away	,	 leav 	 ing 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	a	 wrist 	 watch 	 	or	a	 di 	 ary 	 	page	.
so	no	matter	that	i	have	 inhibit 	 ions 	 	to	fill	all	my	 pocket 	 s 	 	,
i	keep	 try 	 ing 	 	,	 hop 	 ing 	 	that	one	day	i	'll	write	a	poem	i	can	be	proud	to	let	 s 	 it 	 	in	a	museum	exhibit	 a 	 s 	 	the	 on 	 ly 	 	proof	i	 exist 	 ed 	 	.
my	 parent 	 s 	 	named	me	sarah	,	which	is	a	biblical	name	.
in	the	original	story	,	god	told	sarah	she	could	do	 some 	 thing 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	and	she	 laugh 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	first	sarah	,	she	did	n't	know	what	to	do	with	 im 	 possible 	 	.
and	me	?	well	,	 n 	 either 	 	do	i	,	but	i	see	the	 im 	 possible 	 	every	day	.
 im 	 possible 	 	is	 try 	 ing 	 	to	connect	in	 th 	 is 	 	world	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	hold	onto	 other 	 s 	 	while	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 blow 	 ing 	 	up	around	you	,	 know 	 ing 	 	that	while	you	're	 s 	 peaking 	 	,	they	are	n't	just	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	turn	to	talk	--	they	hear	you	.
they	feel	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	you	feel	at	the	same	time	that	you	feel	it	.
it	's	what	i	 striv 	 e 	 	for	every	time	i	open	my	mouth	--	that	 im 	 possible 	 	 connect 	 ion 	 	.
there	's	 th 	 is 	 	piece	of	wall	in	hiroshima	that	was	 complete 	 ly 	 	 burn 	 t 	 	black	by	the	 radi 	 ation 	 	.
but	on	the	front	step	,	a	person	who	was	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	 block 	 ed 	 	the	 ray 	 s 	 	from	hitting	the	stone	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	left	now	is	a	permanent	shadow	of	positive	light	.
after	the	a	-	bomb	,	 special 	 ists 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	it	would	take	75	 year 	 s 	 	for	the	 radi 	 ation 	 	-	 damage 	 d 	 	 s 	 oil 	 	of	hiroshima	city	to	ever	grow	 any 	 thing 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
but	that	spring	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	new	 bud 	 s 	 	 pop 	 ping 	 	up	from	the	earth	.
when	i	meet	you	,	in	that	moment	,	i	'm	no	 long 	 er 	 	a	part	of	your	future	.
i	start	 quick 	 ly 	 	 be 	 coming 	 	part	of	your	past	.
but	in	that	instant	,	i	get	to	share	your	present	.
and	you	,	you	get	to	share	mine	.
and	that	is	the	 great 	 est 	 	present	of	all	.
so	if	you	tell	me	i	can	do	the	 im 	 possible 	 	,	i	'll	 prob 	 ably 	 	laugh	at	you	.
i	do	n't	know	if	i	can	change	the	world	yet	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	do	n't	know	that	much	about	it	--	and	i	do	n't	know	that	much	about	 re 	 incarnation 	 	either	,	but	if	you	make	me	laugh	hard	 en 	 ough 	 	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	i	forget	what	century	i	'm	in	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	my	first	time	here	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	my	last	time	here	.
these	are	n't	the	last	 word 	 s 	 	i	'll	share	.
but	just	in	case	,	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	my	 hard 	 est 	 	to	get	it	right	 th 	 is 	 	time	around	.
thank	you	.
thank	you	.
thank	you	.
