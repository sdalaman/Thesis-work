i	'm	a	historian	.
steve	told	us	about	the	future	of	little	technology	;
i	'm	going	to	show	you	some	of	the	past	of	big	technology	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	project	to	build	a	4,000	-	ton	nuclear	bomb	-	 propel 	 led 	 	 space 	 ship 	 	and	go	to	saturn	and	jupiter	.
 th 	 is 	 	took	place	in	my	 child 	 hood 	 	--	1957	to	'65	.
it	was	 deep 	 ly 	 	 class 	 ified 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	show	you	some	stuff	that	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 be 	 en 	 	 de 	 class 	 ified 	 	,	but	 ha 	 s 	 	now	 be 	 en 	 	 re 	 class 	 ified 	 	.
if	all	 go 	 es 	 	well	,	next	year	i	'll	be	back	and	i	'll	have	a	lot	more	to	show	you	,	and	if	all	 do 	 es 	 	n't	go	well	,	i	'll	be	in	jail	like	wen	ho	lee	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	ship	was	 bas 	 ically 	 	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	marriott	hotel	,	a	little	 tall 	 er 	 	and	a	little	 big 	 ger 	 	.
and	one	of	the	people	who	 work 	 ed 	 	on	it	in	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	was	my	father	,	freeman	,	there	in	the	middle	.
that	's	me	and	my	sister	,	esther	,	who	's	a	frequent	tedster	.
i	did	n't	like	nuclear	bomb	-	 propel 	 led 	 	 space 	 ship 	 s 	 	.
i	mean	,	i	thought	it	was	a	great	idea	,	but	i	 start 	 ed 	 	building	kayaks	.
so	we	had	a	few	kayaks	.
just	so	you	know	,	i	am	not	dr.	strangelove	.
but	all	the	time	i	was	out	there	 do 	 ing 	 	these	strange	kayak	 voyage 	 s 	 	in	odd	,	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 part 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	planet	,	i	 al 	 ways 	 	thought	in	the	back	of	my	mind	about	project	orion	,	and	how	my	father	and	his	 friend 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	build	these	big	 ship 	 s 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	going	to	go	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	to	go	.
ted	taylor	,	who	led	the	project	,	was	going	to	take	his	children	.
my	father	was	not	going	to	take	his	children	;
that	was	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	we	sort	of	had	a	 fall 	 ing 	 	out	for	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	.
the	project	 beg 	 an 	 	in	'57	at	general	atomics	there	.
that	's	right	on	the	coast	at	la	jolla	.
look	at	that	central	building	right	in	the	middle	of	the	picture	:
that	's	the	130	-	foot	 dia 	 meter 	 	library	,
that	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	base	of	the	 space 	 ship 	 	.
so	put	that	library	at	the	bottom	of	that	ship	--	that	's	how	big	the	thing	was	going	to	be	.
it	would	take	2,000	or	3,000	 bomb 	 s 	 	.
the	people	who	 work 	 ed 	 	on	it	 we 	 re 	 	a	lot	of	the	los	alamos	people	who	had	 d 	 one 	 	the	hydrogen	bomb	work	.
it	was	the	first	project	funded	by	arpa	.
that	's	the	contract	where	arpa	 g 	 ave 	 	the	first	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	get	 th 	 is 	 	thing	 start 	 ed 	 	.
``	 space 	 ship 	 	project	 official 	 ly 	 	 beg 	 un 	 	.	job	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	you	.	dyson	.	``	that	's	july	'58	.
two	 day 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	the	space	 travel 	 er 	 	's	 manifest 	 o 	 	 explain 	 ing 	 	why	--	just	like	we	heard	 yester 	 day 	 	--	why	we	need	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	space	:
``	 trip 	 s 	 	to	 satellite 	 s 	 	of	the	 out 	 er 	 	 planet 	 s 	 	.	august	20	,	1958	.	``
these	are	the	 statistic 	 s 	 	of	what	would	be	the	good	 place 	 s 	 	to	go	and	stop	.
some	of	the	 s 	 ize 	 s 	 	of	the	 ship 	 s 	 	,	ranging	all	the	way	up	to	ship	mass	of	8	million	 ton 	 s 	 	,
so	that	was	the	 out 	 er 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 	.
here	was	version	two	:	2,000	 bomb 	 s 	 	.
these	are	five	kiloton	yield	 bomb 	 s 	 	about	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	small	volkswagens	;
it	would	take	800	to	get	 in 	 to 	 	orbit	.
here	we	see	a	10,000	ton	ship	will	deliver	1,300	 ton 	 s 	 	to	saturn	and	back	;
 essential 	 ly 	 	a	five	year	trip	.
possible	 depart 	 ure 	 	 date 	 s 	 	:	october	1960	to	february	1967	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 tra 	 ject 	 ories 	 	going	to	mars	;
all	 th 	 is 	 	was	 d 	 one 	 	by	hand	with	slide	 rule 	 s 	 	.
the	little	orion	ship	and	what	it	would	take	to	do	what	orion	 do 	 es 	 	with	 chemical 	 s 	 	:	you	have	a	ship	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	empire	state	building	.
nasa	had	no	interest	;	they	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	kill	the	project	.
the	people	who	 support 	 ed 	 	it	 we 	 re 	 	the	air	force	,	which	 me 	 ant 	 	that	it	was	all	secret	.
and	that	's	why	when	you	get	 some 	 thing 	 	 de 	 class 	 ified 	 	,	that	's	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
 militar 	 y 	 	weapon	 version 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 version 	 s 	 	that	carried	hydrogen	 bomb 	 s 	 	that	could	destroy	half	the	planet	.
there	's	 an 	 other 	 	version	there	that	 s 	 end 	 s 	 	retaliatory	 strike 	 s 	 	at	the	soviet	 un 	 ion 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	real	secret	stuff	:	how	to	get	 direct 	 ed 	 	energy	 explosion 	 s 	 	so	you	're	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	the	energy	of	a	nuclear	explosion	--	not	like	just	a	stick	of	 dynam 	 ite 	 	,	but	you	're	 direct 	 ing 	 	it	at	the	ship	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	still	a	 ver 	 y 	 	active	subject	.
it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	,	but	i	 believ 	 e 	 	it	's	better	to	have	 danger 	 ous 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	in	the	open	than	think	you	're	going	to	keep	them	secret	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	at	600	 micro 	 second 	 s 	 	.
the	air	force	 start 	 ed 	 	to	build	 small 	 er 	 	 model 	 s 	 	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
the	 guy 	 s 	 	in	la	jolla	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	've	got	to	get	 start 	 ed 	 	now	.	``
they	built	a	high	-	explosive	 propel 	 led 	 	model	.
these	are	 still 	 s 	 	from	film	 foot 	 age 	 	that	was	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	by	 some 	 one 	 	who	was	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	destroy	it	but	did	n't	and	 ke 	 pt 	 	it	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 base 	 ment 	 	for	the	last	40	 year 	 s 	 	.
so	,	these	are	three	-	pound	 charge 	 s 	 	of	c	4	;
that	's	about	10	 time 	 s 	 	what	the	guy	had	in	his	 shoe 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	ed	day	 put 	 ting 	 	...	so	each	of	these	coffee	 can 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	three	 pound 	 s 	 	of	c	4	in	it	.
they	're	building	a	system	that	ejects	these	at	quarter	-	second	 inter 	 val 	 s 	 	.
that	's	my	dad	in	the	 s 	 port 	 	coat	there	 hold 	 ing 	 	the	briefcase	.
so	,	they	had	a	lot	of	 f 	 un 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.	but	no	children	 we 	 re 	 	 allow 	 ed 	 	;
my	dad	could	tell	me	he	was	building	a	 space 	 ship 	 	and	going	to	go	to	saturn	,	but	he	could	not	say	 any 	 thing 	 	more	about	it	.
so	all	my	life	i	have	 want 	 ed 	 	to	find	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	out	,	and	 s 	 pent 	 	the	last	four	 year 	 s 	 	 track 	 ing 	 	these	old	 guy 	 s 	 	down	.
these	are	 still 	 s 	 	from	the	video	.
jeff	bezos	 kind 	 ly 	 	,	 yester 	 day 	 	,	 s 	 aid 	 	he	'll	put	 th 	 is 	 	video	up	on	the	amazon	 s 	 ite 	 	--	some	little	clip	of	it	.
so	,	 thank 	 s 	 	to	him	.
they	got	 quit 	 e 	 	serious	about	the	 engineer 	 ing 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	that	mass	,	for	us	,	is	 re 	 ally 	 	large	technology	in	a	way	we	're	never	going	to	go	back	to	.
if	you	saw	the	1959	...	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	would	feel	like	in	the	passenger	compartment	;
that	's	 accele 	 ration 	 	profile	.
and	 puls 	 e 	 	system	yield	:	we	're	looking	at	20	-	kiloton	yield	for	an	effect	for	us	of	10	million	newtons	.
well	,	here	we	have	a	little	problem	,	the	 radi 	 ation 	 	 dose 	 s 	 	at	the	crew	station	:	700	 rad 	 s 	 	per	shot	.
 fi 	 s 	 s 	 ion 	 	 yield 	 s 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	:	they	 we 	 re 	 	 hop 	 ing 	 	to	get	clean	 bomb 	 s 	 	--	they	did	n't	.
eyeburn	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	the	people	in	miami	who	are	looking	up	.
 person 	 nel 	 	compartment	noise	:	that	's	not	too	bad	;
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	low	 fr 	 equ 	 encies 	 	,	it	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	like	these	subwoofers	.
and	now	we	have	ground	hazard	 assess 	 ments 	 	when	you	have	a	blow	-	up	on	the	pad	.
 final 	 ly 	 	,	at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	end	in	1964	,	nasa	 step 	 s 	 	in	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	ok	,	we	'll	support	a	 feas 	 ibility 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	for	a	small	version	that	could	be	 launch 	 ed 	 	with	saturn	vs	in	 section 	 s 	 	and	pieced	together	.	``
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	nasa	did	,	 get 	 ting 	 	an	eight	man	version	that	would	go	to	mars	.
they	 like 	 d 	 	it	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 guy 	 s 	 	who	kind	of	live	there	would	be	like	,	``	it	's	just	like	living	in	a	 sub 	 marine 	 	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	crew	compartment	.	it	 s 	 witch 	 es 	 	,	so	what	's	 up 	 side 	 	down	is	right	side	up	when	you	go	to	artificial	 gravit 	 y 	 	mode	.
the	 scientist 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	still	going	to	go	 a 	 long 	 	;	they	would	take	seven	 astro 	 nauts 	 	and	seven	 scientist 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	20	man	version	for	going	to	jupiter	:	 bunk 	 s 	 	,	storm	cellars	,	 exercis 	 e 	 	room	.
you	know	,	it	was	going	to	be	a	nice	long	trip	.
the	air	force	version	:	here	we	have	a	 militar 	 y 	 	version	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	kind	of	stuff	that	's	not	 be 	 en 	 	 de 	 class 	 ified 	 	,	just	that	people	 manage 	 d 	 	to	sneak	home	and	after	,	you	know	,	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 death 	 bed 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	me	.
the	sort	of	artist	 conception 	 s 	 	:	these	are	 bas 	 ically 	 	powerpoint	 present 	 ations 	 	 give 	 n 	 	to	the	air	force	40	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
look	at	the	little	 guy 	 s 	 	there	 out 	 side 	 	the	vehicle	.
and	one	part	of	nasa	was	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	it	but	the	 head 	 quarter 	 s 	 	in	nasa	,	they	 kill 	 ed 	 	the	project	.
so	 final 	 ly 	 	at	the	end	,	we	can	see	the	thing	 follow 	 ed 	 	 it 	 s 	 	sort	of	design	path	right	up	to	1965	and	then	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 path 	 s 	 	came	to	a	halt	.
 result 	 s 	 	:	 non 	 e 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	project	is	hereby	terminated	.
so	that	's	the	end	.	all	i	can	say	in	 clo 	 s 	 ing 	 	is	,	we	heard	 yester 	 day 	 	that	one	of	the	10	bad	 thing 	 s 	 	that	could	happen	to	us	is	an	 a 	 steroid 	 	with	our	name	on	it	.
and	one	of	the	bad	 thing 	 s 	 	that	could	happen	to	nasa	is	if	that	 a 	 steroid 	 	 show 	 s 	 	up	with	our	name	on	it	nine	 month 	 s 	 	out	and	 every 	 body 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	well	,	what	are	we	going	to	do	?	``
and	orion	is	 re 	 ally 	 	one	of	the	 on 	 ly 	 	,	if	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	,	off	-	the	-	shelf	 techno 	 logies 	 	that	could	do	 some 	 thing 	 	.
so	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	the	good	news	and	the	bad	news	.
the	good	news	is	that	nasa	 ha 	 s 	 	a	small	,	secret	 con 	 ting 	 ency 	 	plan	division	that	is	looking	at	 th 	 is 	 	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	keep	knowledge	of	orion	 preserve 	 d 	 	in	the	event	of	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 mis 	 fortune 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	keep	a	few	little	 bomb 	 s 	 	of	 p 	 lu 	 ton 	 ium 	 	on	the	side	.
that	's	the	good	news	.	the	bad	news	is	,	when	i	got	in	contact	with	these	people	to	try	and	get	some	 document 	 s 	 	from	them	,	they	went	crazy	 be 	 cause 	 	i	had	all	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	that	they	do	n't	have	,
and	nasa	 purchase 	 d 	 	1,759	 page 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	from	me	.
so	that	's	the	state	we	're	at	:	it	's	not	 ver 	 y 	 	good	.
