 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	i	made	,	which	is	a	way	of	,	kind	of	,	 free 	 ing 	 	a	form	 in 	 to 	 	an	object	that	 ha 	 s 	 	different	 degree 	 s 	 	of	 free 	 dom 	 	.
so	,	it	can	balance	on	a	point	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 bron 	 ze 	 	ball	,	an	 a 	 lumin 	 um 	 	arm	here	,	and	then	 th 	 is 	 	 wood 	 en 	 	 dis 	 k 	 	.
and	the	 wood 	 en 	 	 dis 	 k 	 	was	 re 	 ally 	 	thought	about	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	you	'd	want	to	hold	on	to	,	and	that	would	glide	 eas 	 ily 	 	through	your	 hand 	 s 	 	.
the	 a 	 lumin 	 um 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	light	.
the	 bron 	 ze 	 	is	nice	hard	,	 dur 	 able 	 	material	that	could	roll	on	the	ground	.	 in 	 side 	 	of	the	 bron 	 ze 	 	ball	there	's	a	lead	weight	that	is	free	-	 s 	 wing 	 ing 	 	on	an	axle	that	's	on	two	 bear 	 ing 	 s 	 	that	pass	in	between	,	 a 	 cross 	 	it	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	that	 counter 	 balance 	 	 th 	 is 	 	weight	.
so	it	 allow 	 s 	 	it	to	roll	.
and	the	sphere	 ha 	 s 	 	that	balance	 proper 	 ty 	 	that	it	 al 	 ways 	 	sort	of	 stay 	 s 	 	still	and	 look 	 s 	 	the	same	from	every	direction	.
but	if	you	put	 some 	 thing 	 	on	top	of	it	,	it	 dis 	 balance 	 s 	 	it	.	and	so	it	would	tip	over	.
but	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 in 	 terior 	 	is	free	-	 s 	 wing 	 ing 	 	in	relation	to	the	sphere	,	it	can	stand	up	on	one	point	.
and	then	there	was	a	second	level	to	 th 	 is 	 	object	,	which	is	that	it	--	i	 want 	 ed 	 	it	to	convey	some	 proportion 	 s 	 	that	i	was	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	,	which	is	the	 dia 	 meter 	 	of	the	moon	and	the	 dia 	 meter 	 	of	the	earth	in	proportion	to	each	other	.
i	was	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	early	on	,	 want 	 ing 	 	to	make	 thing 	 s 	 	float	in	the	air	.
and	i	thought	up	a	lot	of	 idea 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	that	i	made	that	--	it	's	 magnet 	 ically 	 	 levit 	 ated 	 	.
the	thing	is	,	is	that	it	's	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
 normal 	 ly 	 	it	's	sort	of	 cord 	 on 	 ed 	 	off	when	it	's	in	a	museum	.
but	it	's	uh	--	let	's	see	if	i	can	 manipul 	 ate 	 	it	a	little	bit	 with 	 out 	 	,	um	--	 oop 	 s 	 	.	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	 float 	 ing 	 	,	 float 	 ing 	 	on	a	permanent	 magnet 	 ic 	 	field	,	which	 stabil 	 ize 	 s 	 	it	in	all	 direction 	 s 	 	.
 ex 	 cept 	 	there	is	a	 s 	 light 	 	tether	here	,	which	 keep 	 s 	 	it	from	going	over	the	top	of	 it 	 s 	 	field	.
it	's	sort	of	surfing	on	a	 magnet 	 ic 	 	field	at	the	crest	of	a	wave	.
and	that	's	what	 support 	 s 	 	the	object	and	 keep 	 s 	 	it	 s 	 table 	 	.
i	think	we	could	roll	the	tape	,	 ad 	 min 	 	.
i	have	a	sort	of	a	 collect 	 ion 	 	of	 video 	 s 	 	that	i	took	of	different	 install 	 ations 	 	,	which	i	could	narrate	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	of	the	 s 	 un 	 	and	the	earth	,	in	proportion	.
 represent 	 ing 	 	that	eight	and	a	half	 minute 	 s 	 	that	it	 take 	 s 	 	light	and	 gravit 	 y 	 	to	connect	the	two	.
so	here	is	the	earth	.	it	's	a	little	less	than	a	millimeter	that	was	 turn 	 ed 	 	of	solid	 bron 	 ze 	 	.
and	here	is	a	similar	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	.
that	's	the	 s 	 un 	 	at	that	end	.
and	then	in	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	55	 ball 	 s 	 	,	it	 reduc 	 es 	 	,	 proportion 	 ate 	 ly 	 	--	each	ball	and	the	 space 	 s 	 	between	them	 reduc 	 e 	 	 proportion 	 ate 	 ly 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	they	get	down	to	 th 	 is 	 	little	earth	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	in	a	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	park	in	taejon	.
 th 	 is 	 	one	is	about	the	moon
and	then	the	distance	to	the	earth	,	in	proportion	 al 	 so 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	little	stone	ball	,	 float 	 ing 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	the	little	tether	,	that	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 magnet 	 ically 	 	 levit 	 ated 	 	.
and	then	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	part	of	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	109	 sphere 	 s 	 	,	since	the	 s 	 un 	 	is	109	 time 	 s 	 	the	 dia 	 meter 	 	of	the	earth	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
and	then	each	of	these	little	 sphere 	 s 	 	is	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	earth	in	proportion	to	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
it	's	made	up	of	16	 con 	 centric 	 	 shell 	 s 	 	.	each	one	 ha 	 s 	 	92	 sphere 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	in	the	 court 	 yard 	 	of	a	twelfth	-	century	 al 	 chemist 	 	.
i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	that	the	 s 	 un 	 	is	kind	of	the	ultimate	 al 	 chemist 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	is	on	the	subject	--	a	slice	from	the	 equ 	 ator 	 	of	the	earth	.
and	then	the	moon	in	the	center	,
and	it	's	 float 	 ing 	 	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	in	france	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	in	sapporo	.
it	's	 balanc 	 ing 	 	on	a	shaft	and	a	ball	,	right	at	the	center	of	 gravit 	 y 	 	,	or	just	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	above	the	center	of	 gravit 	 y 	 	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	that	the	lower	half	of	the	object	is	just	a	little	bit	more	 weight 	 y 	 	.
so	you	can	see	it	 rot 	 ating 	 	here	.
it	 weigh 	 s 	 	about	a	ton	or	over	a	ton	.
it	's	made	of	 stain 	 less 	 	steel	,	 quit 	 e 	 	thick	.
but	it	's	 be 	 ing 	 	 balanc 	 ed 	 	like	that	in	equilibrium	.
it	's	susceptible	to	motion	by	the	air	 current 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	species	of	work	that	i	do	.
these	are	these	 array 	 s 	 	.	these	 sphere 	 s 	 	are	all	 suspend 	 ed 	 	,
but	they	have	 magnet 	 s 	 	 horizon 	 t 	 ally 	 	in	them	that	make	them	all	like	 compass 	 es 	 	.
so	all	the	red	 side 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	face	one	direction	:	south	.
and	the	blue	side	,	the	compliment	,	 face 	 s 	 	the	other	way	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	you	turn	around	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	different	 color 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	based	on	the	structure	of	a	diamond	.
it	was	a	diamond	cell	structure	was	the	point	of	 depart 	 ure 	 	.
and	then	there	 we 	 re 	 	kind	of	large	 space 	 s 	 	in	the	 hollow 	 s 	 	between	the	 atom 	 s 	 	.
and	so	i	 place 	 d 	 	one	more	element	of	each	one	of	them	.
these	 we 	 re 	 	white	 sphere 	 s 	 	.
then	i	had	video	 project 	 ors 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 project 	 ing 	 	 intermittent 	 ly 	 	onto	the	 sphere 	 s 	 	.
so	they	would	catch	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	 image 	 s 	 	,	and	make	sort	of	three	-	dimensional	color	 volume 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	walk	through	it	,	through	the	object	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	i	did	of	a	 tact 	 ile 	 	communication	system	.
it	was	the	idea	of	 isol 	 ating 	 	the	 tact 	 ile 	 	component	of	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	,	and	then	 put 	 ting 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	communication	system	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	idea	of	moving	a	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	,	a	ball	,	that	would	be	 direct 	 ed 	 	around	the	room	by	a	computer	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	clock	i	designed	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	buckminster	 full 	 er 	 	's	dymaxion	map	 edit 	 ed 	 	here	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	once	per	day	in	 synchron 	 y 	 	with	the	earth	.
and	then	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	like	 project 	 s 	 	that	are	 hard 	 er 	 	to	build	.
 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	diamond	-	bottomed	lake	.
so	it	's	a	 float 	 ing 	 	 is 	 land 	 	with	water	,	fresh	water	,
that	can	fly	from	place	to	place	.
 th 	 is 	 	would	be	grown	,	i	suppose	,	with	 nano 	 technology 	 	in	the	future	 some 	 time 	 	.
in	the	course	of	 do 	 ing 	 	my	work	i	sort	of	have	a	broad	range	of	 interest 	 s 	 	.
and	some	of	it	is	just	the	idea	of	creating	media	--	media	 a 	 s 	 	a	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	would	keep	the	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	fresh	and	ever	-	changing	,	by	just	creating	the	media	that	the	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	is	made	of	.
and	i	had	a	lot	of	--	 al 	 ways 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	 con 	 cept 	 	of	a	crystal	ball	.
and	the	idea	that	you	could	see	 thing 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	of	a	crystal	ball	and	predict	the	future	--	or	a	 tele 	 vision 	 	set	,	where	it	's	sort	of	like	a	magic	box	where	 any 	 thing 	 	can	appear	.
i	had	thought	about	,	a	long	time	ago	,	in	the	late	'60s	--	when	i	was	just	 start 	 ing 	 	out	,	i	was	under	the	influence	of	 think 	 ing 	 	about	buckminster	 full 	 er 	 	's	grand	project	for	an	electric	 glob 	 e 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	from	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	--	and	other	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	,	the	space	program	at	that	time	,
and	whole	earth	catalog	,	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	.
i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	about	mass	 produce 	 d 	 	 spheric 	 al 	 	 tele 	 vision 	 	 set 	 s 	 	that	could	be	linked	to	 orbit 	 ing 	 	camera	 satellite 	 s 	 	.
so	if	we	could	roll	the	next	film	here	.
 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	over	the	 year 	 s 	 	in	a	lot	of	different	 iteration 	 s 	 	.	but	 th 	 is 	 	the	current	version	of	it	,
is	a	 fly 	 ing 	 	 air 	 ship 	 	that	is	about	35	 meter 	 s 	 	in	 dia 	 meter 	 	,	about	110	feet	in	 dia 	 meter 	 	.
the	whole	surface	of	it	is	 cover 	 ed 	 	with	60	million	diodes	,	red	,	blue	,	and	green	,	that	allow	you	to	have	a	high	-	 re 	 solution 	 	picture	,	visible	in	 day 	 light 	 	.
i	came	with	a	plan	.
i	 br 	 ought 	 	it	to	paul	maccready	's	company	aerovironment	to	do	a	 feas 	 ibility 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	,	and	they	 analyz 	 ed 	 	it	,	and	came	up	with	a	lot	of	 innov 	 ative 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	about	how	to	propel	it	.
so	we	have	a	physical	plan	of	how	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	happen	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	control	room	 in 	 side 	 	of	the	ship	.
the	idea	of	 th 	 is 	 	air	 gen 	 ie 	 	is	,	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	can	just	transform	and	 be 	 come 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	.
it	's	like	a	 travel 	 ing 	 	show	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	 speaker 	 s 	 	on	it	.	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 camera 	 s 	 	over	the	surface	of	it	.
so	it	can	see	 it 	 s 	 	environment	,	and	then	it	can	mimic	 it 	 s 	 	environment	and	disappear	.
here	the	 leg 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 tract 	 ing 	 	.
the	 cab 	 in 	 	is	open	or	closed	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	like	.
it	 weigh 	 s 	 	about	20	 ton 	 s 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	on	-	board	 gene 	 rator 	 s 	 	.
it	can	generate	about	a	million	 kilowatt 	 s 	 	,	in	order	to	be	bright	 en 	 ough 	 	to	be	visible	in	 day 	 light 	 	.
the	idea	of	it	is	to	make	a	kind	of	a	 travel 	 ing 	 	show	.
it	 re 	 ally 	 	would	be	 dedicate 	 d 	 	to	the	 art 	 s 	 	and	to	 interact 	 ing 	 	.
there	would	be	on	board	a	crew	of	 artist 	 s 	 	,	 music 	 ians 	 	,
that	would	allow	the	thing	to	 be 	 come 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	kind	of	a	conscious	object	that	would	respond	to	the	moment	,	and	to	interact	 a 	 s 	 	an	 ent 	 ity 	 	that	was	aware	,	that	could	communicate	.
it	's	 complete 	 ly 	 	silent	and	 non 	 polluting 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	electric	 motor 	 s 	 	with	a	novel	 pro 	 pulsion 	 	system	.
it	could	be	 interact 	 ed 	 	with	large	 crowd 	 s 	 	in	different	ways	.
 prim 	 arily 	 	i	would	be	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	how	it	would	interact	with	,	say	,	going	to	a	college	campus	,	and	then	 be 	 ing 	 	used	 a 	 s 	 	a	way	of	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	earth	 science 	 s 	 	,	the	world	,	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	of	the	 glob 	 e 	 	.
the	default	image	on	the	object	would	 prob 	 ably 	 	be	a	high	-	 re 	 solution 	 	earth	image	.
but	then	one	could	interact	with	that	and	show	plate	 tectonic 	 s 	 	or	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	,	or	 migr 	 ations 	 	--	all	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 concern 	 ed 	 	with	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	then	at	night	the	idea	is	that	it	would	be	used	 a 	 s 	 	kind	of	a	rave	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	where	the	people	could	cut	loose	,	and	the	music	and	the	 light 	 s 	 	,	and	 every 	 thing 	 	.
so	it	could	land	in	a	park	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
or	 th 	 is 	 	could	represent	a	college	green	.
and	then	it	would	have	a	 correspond 	 ing 	 	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	that	would	show	the	 itiner 	 ary 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	so	 interact 	 ing 	 	with	the	same	kind	of	 image 	 ry 	 	.
it	would	 al 	 so 	 	be	able	to	be	an	open	code	,	so	people	could	interact	with	it	.
it	would	be	forum	for	people	's	 idea 	 s 	 	about	what	they	would	like	to	see	on	a	giant	screen	of	 th 	 is 	 	type	.
so	that	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	it	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	thank	you	.
