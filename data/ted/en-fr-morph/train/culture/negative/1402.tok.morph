you	see	,	 humming 	 bird 	 s 	 	are	not	 hyper 	 sonic 	 	,	but	they	are	maneuverable	.

it	can	fly	up	,	down	,	 forward 	 s 	 	,	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	even	 up 	 side 	 	-	down	.
and	so	if	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	fly	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	or	 place 	 s 	 	where	 human 	 s 	 	ca	n't	go	,	we	'd	need	an	 air 	 craft 	 	small	 en 	 ough 	 	and	maneuverable	 en 	 ough 	 	to	do	so	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 humming 	 bird 	 	drone	.

and	remember	,	be	nice	to	 nerd 	 s 	 	.
thank	you	.	thank	you	.
chris	anderson	:	regina	,	thank	you	.
i	have	a	couple	of	 question 	 s 	 	.
so	that	glider	of	 your 	 s 	 	,	the	mach	20	glider	,	the	first	one	,	no	control	,	it	 end 	 ed 	 	up	in	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	i	think	 some 	 where 	 	.
rd	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	 yea 	 h 	 	.	it	did	.
 yea 	 h 	 	,	it	 al 	 so 	 	went	 in 	 to 	 	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	.
we	did	n't	fly	it	 in 	 to 	 	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	.
no	,	there	are	 multi 	 ple 	 	 port 	 ions 	 	of	the	 tra 	 ject 	 ory 	 	that	are	 demand 	 ing 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 re 	 ally 	 	 fly 	 ing 	 	at	that	speed	.
and	so	in	the	second	flight	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	get	three	 minute 	 s 	 	of	fully	 aero 	 dynamic 	 	control	of	the	vehicle	before	we	lost	it	.
ca	:	i	imagine	you	're	not	 plan 	 ning 	 	to	open	up	to	passenger	service	from	new	york	to	long	beach	 any 	 time 	 	soon	.
rd	:	it	might	be	a	little	warm	.
ca	:	what	do	you	picture	that	glider	 be 	 ing 	 	used	for	?
rd	:	well	our	 respons 	 ibility 	 	is	to	develop	the	technology	for	 th 	 is 	 	.
how	it	's	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	used	will	be	 determine 	 d 	 	by	the	 militar 	 y 	 	.
now	the	purpose	of	the	vehicle	 th 	 ough 	 	,	the	purpose	of	the	technology	,	is	to	be	able	to	reach	 any 	 where 	 	in	the	world	in	less	than	60	 minute 	 s 	 	.
ca	:	and	to	carry	a	 pay 	 load 	 	of	more	than	a	few	 pound 	 s 	 	?	like	what	's	the	 pay 	 load 	 	it	could	carry	?
rd	:	well	i	do	n't	think	we	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	know	what	it	will	be	,	right	.
we	've	got	to	fly	it	first	.
ca	:	but	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	just	a	camera	?
rd	:	no	,	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	just	a	camera	.
ca	:	it	's	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
the	 humming 	 bird 	 	?
rd	:	 yea 	 h 	 	?
ca	:	i	'm	 cur 	 ious 	 	,	you	 start 	 ed 	 	your	 beaut 	 iful 	 	sequence	on	flight	with	a	plane	kind	of	 try 	 ing 	 	to	flap	 it 	 s 	 	 wing 	 s 	 	and	 fail 	 ing 	 	 horr 	 ibly 	 	,	and	there	have	n't	 be 	 en 	 	that	 man 	 y 	 	 plane 	 s 	 	built	since	that	flap	 wing 	 s 	 	.
why	did	we	think	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	time	to	go	 bio 	 mimicry 	 	and	copy	a	 humming 	 bird 	 	?
is	n't	that	a	 ver 	 y 	 	expensive	solution	for	a	small	maneuverable	 fly 	 ing 	 	object	?
rd	:	so	i	mean	,	in	part	,	we	 wonder 	 ed 	 	if	it	was	possible	to	do	it	.
and	you	have	to	 re 	 visit 	 	these	 question 	 s 	 	over	time	.
the	 folk 	 s 	 	at	aerovironment	 tri 	 ed 	 	300	or	more	different	wing	 design 	 s 	 	,	12	different	 form 	 s 	 	of	the	avionics	.
it	took	them	10	full	 prototype 	 s 	 	to	get	 some 	 thing 	 	that	would	 actual 	 ly 	 	fly	.
but	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	about	a	 fly 	 ing 	 	machine	that	 look 	 s 	 	like	 some 	 thing 	 	you	'd	 recogn 	 ize 	 	.
so	we	often	talk	about	 steal 	 th 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 mean 	 s 	 	for	 avoid 	 ing 	 	any	type	of	 sens 	 ing 	 	,	but	when	 thing 	 s 	 	 look 	 s 	 	just	natural	,	you	 al 	 so 	 	do	n't	see	them	.
ca	:	ah	.	so	it	's	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	just	the	performance	.
it	's	 part 	 ly 	 	the	look	.	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	``	look	at	that	cute	 humming 	 bird 	 	 fly 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	my	 head 	 quarter 	 s 	 	.	``
 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	the	awe	of	looking	at	that	,	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	some	people	here	are	 think 	 ing 	 	,	technology	 catch 	 es 	 	up	so	quick	,	how	long	is	it	before	some	 craze 	 d 	 	geek	with	a	little	remote	control	flies	one	through	a	window	of	the	white	house	?
i	mean	,	do	you	worry	about	the	pandora	's	box	issue	here	?
rd	:	well	look	,	our	 s 	 ing 	 ular 	 	mission	is	the	creation	and	 prevent 	 ion 	 	of	 strat 	 egic 	 	surprise	.
that	's	what	we	do	.
it	would	be	 in 	 conceiv 	 able 	 
for	us	to	do	that	work	if	we	did	n't	make	people	 excit 	 ed 	 	and	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	with	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	do	at	the	same	time	.
it	's	just	the	nature	of	what	we	do	.
now	our	 respons 	 ibility 	 	is	to	push	that	edge	.
and	we	have	to	be	,	of	course	,	 mind 	 ful 	 	and	 respons 	 ible 	 	of	how	the	technology	is	 develop 	 ed 	 	and	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	used	,	but	we	ca	n't	 simpl 	 y 	 	close	our	 eye 	 s 	 	and	pretend	that	it	is	n't	 advanc 	 ing 	 	;	it	's	 advanc 	 ing 	 	.
ca	:	i	mean	,	you	're	 clear 	 ly 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	inspiring	 lead 	 er 	 	.
and	you	 persuad 	 e 	 	people	to	go	to	these	great	 feat 	 s 	 	of	 invent 	 ion 	 	,	but	at	a	personal	level	,	in	a	way	i	ca	n't	imagine	 do 	 ing 	 	your	job	.
do	you	wake	up	in	the	night	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	just	 ask 	 ing 	 	 question 	 s 	 	about	the	possibly	 un 	 intend 	 ed 	 	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	of	your	team	's	 brilli 	 ance 	 	?
rd	:	 s 	 ure 	 	.	i	think	you	could	n't	be	human	if	you	did	n't	ask	 t 	 hose 	 	 question 	 s 	 	.
ca	:	how	do	you	answer	them	?
rd	:	well	i	do	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	have	 answer 	 s 	 	for	them	,	right	.
i	think	that	we	learn	 a 	 s 	 	time	 go 	 es 	 	on	.
my	job	is	one	of	the	most	 exhila 	 rating 	 	 job 	 s 	 	you	could	have	.
i	work	with	some	of	the	most	 amaz 	 ing 	 	people	.
and	with	that	 exhila 	 ration 	 	,	 come 	 s 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	deep	sense	of	 respons 	 ibility 	 	.
and	so	you	have	on	the	one	hand	 th 	 is 	 	tremendous	lift	of	what	's	possible	and	 th 	 is 	 	tremendous	 serious 	 ness 	 	of	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	.	ca	:	regina	,	that	was	jaw	-	dropping	,	 a 	 s 	 	they	say	.
thank	you	so	much	for	coming	to	ted	.
