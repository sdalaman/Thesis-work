first	place	i	'd	like	to	take	you	is	what	 man 	 y 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	will	be	the	world	's	 deep 	 est 	 	natural	abyss	.
and	i	say	 believ 	 e 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	process	is	still	 on 	 going 	 	.
right	now	there	are	major	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 plan 	 ned 	 	for	next	year	that	i	'll	talk	a	little	bit	about	.
one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	's	 change 	 d 	 	here	,	in	the	last	150	 year 	 s 	 	since	jules	verne	had	great	science	-	fiction	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	of	what	the	 under 	 world 	 	was	like	,	is	that	technology	 ha 	 s 	 	enabled	us	to	go	to	these	 place 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 previous 	 ly 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	 un 	 known 	 	and	 specul 	 ated 	 	about	.
we	can	now	descend	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 meter 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	earth	with	 relat 	 ive 	 	 imp 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
 a 	 long 	 	the	way	we	've	 discover 	 ed 	 	fantastic	 abyss 	 es 	 	and	 chamber 	 s 	 	so	large	that	you	can	see	for	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 meter 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	a	break	in	the	line	of	sight	.
when	you	go	on	a	thing	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	can	 usual 	 ly 	 	be	in	the	field	for	 any 	 where 	 	from	two	to	four	 month 	 s 	 	,	with	a	team	 a 	 s 	 	small	 a 	 s 	 	20	or	30	,	to	 a 	 s 	 	big	 a 	 s 	 	150	.
and	a	lot	of	people	ask	me	,	you	know	,	what	kind	of	people	do	you	get	for	a	project	like	 th 	 is 	 	?
while	our	 s 	 election 	 	process	is	not	 a 	 s 	 	 rigor 	 ous 	 	 a 	 s 	 	nasa	,	it	's	 non 	 e 	 the 	 less 	 	thorough	.
we	're	looking	for	 compete 	 nce 	 	,	discipline	,	 endur 	 ance 	 	,	and	strength	.
in	case	you	're	 wonder 	 ing 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	our	strength	test	.
but	we	 al 	 so 	 	value	 es 	 pri 	 t 	 	de	 corp 	 s 	 	and	the	ability	to	 diplomat 	 ically 	 	 re 	 solve 	 	inter	-	personal	conflict	while	under	great	stress	in	remote	 location 	 s 	 	.
we	have	 al 	 ready 	 	gone	far	beyond	the	 limit 	 s 	 	of	human	 endur 	 ance 	 	.
from	the	 en 	 trance 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 noth 	 ing 	 	like	a	commercial	cave	.
you	're	looking	at	camp	two	in	a	place	 call 	 ed 	 	j	2	,	not	k	2	,	but	j	2	.
we	're	 rough 	 ly 	 	two	 day 	 s 	 	from	the	 en 	 trance 	 	at	that	point	.
and	it	's	kind	of	like	a	high	altitude	 mountain 	 eer 	 ing 	 	trip	in	reverse	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	that	you	're	now	running	a	string	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	down	.
the	idea	is	to	try	to	provide	some	measure	of	physical	comfort	while	you	're	down	there	,	 other 	 wise 	 	in	 dam 	 p 	 	,	moist	,	cold	 condition 	 s 	 	in	 utter 	 ly 	 	dark	 place 	 s 	 	.
i	should	 ment 	 ion 	 	that	 every 	 thing 	 	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	here	,	by	the	way	,	is	 artificial 	 ly 	 	 illuminate 	 d 	 	at	great	effort	.
 other 	 wise 	 	it	is	 complete 	 ly 	 	dark	in	these	 place 	 s 	 	.
the	 deep 	 er 	 	you	go	,	the	more	you	run	 in 	 to 	 	a	conflict	with	water	.
it	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	like	a	tree	 collect 	 ing 	 	water	coming	down	.
and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	you	get	to	 place 	 s 	 	where	it	is	 for 	 mid 	 able 	 	and	 danger 	 ous 	 	and	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	 slide 	 s 	 	just	do	n't	do	justice	.
so	i	've	got	a	 ver 	 y 	 	brief	clip	here	that	was	taken	in	the	late	1980s	.
so	descend	 in 	 to 	 	huautla	 plate 	 au 	 	in	mexico	.
now	i	have	to	tell	you	that	the	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 show 	 n 	 	here	are	 obsolet 	 e 	 	and	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
we	would	not	do	 th 	 is 	 	 to 	 day 	 	 un 	 less 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	it	for	film	.
 a 	 long 	 	that	same	line	,	i	have	to	tell	you	that	with	the	 sp 	 ate 	 	of	hollywood	 movie 	 s 	 	that	came	out	last	year	,	we	have	never	 s 	 een 	 	 mon 	 sters 	 	 under 	 ground 	 	--	at	 l 	 east 	 	the	kind	that	eat	you	.
if	there	is	a	 mon 	 ster 	 	 under 	 ground 	 	,	it	is	the	 crush 	 ing 	 	 psycho 	 logical 	 	 remote 	 ness 	 	that	 begin 	 s 	 	to	hit	every	member	of	the	team	once	you	cross	about	three	 day 	 s 	 	 in 	 bound 	 	from	the	 near 	 est 	 	 en 	 trance 	 	.
next	year	i	'll	be	 lead 	 ing 	 	an	 inter 	 national 	 	team	to	j	2	.
we	're	going	to	be	 shoot 	 ing 	 	from	minus	2,600	 meter 	 s 	 	--	that	's	a	little	over	8,600	feet	down	--	at	30	 kilometer 	 s 	 	from	the	 en 	 trance 	 	.
the	lead	 crew 	 s 	 	will	be	 under 	 ground 	 	for	 push 	 ing 	 	30	 day 	 s 	 	straight	.
i	do	n't	think	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	mission	like	that	in	a	long	time	.	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	if	you	keep	going	down	in	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 prob 	 ability 	 	 say 	 s 	 	that	you	're	going	to	run	 in 	 to 	 	a	place	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	's	a	place	where	there	's	a	fold	in	the	 geo 	 logic 	 	 strat 	 um 	 	that	 collect 	 s 	 	water	and	 fill 	 s 	 	to	the	roof	.
and	when	you	used	to	find	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	they	would	put	a	label	on	a	map	that	 s 	 aid 	 	terminal	siphon	.
now	i	remember	that	term	 re 	 ally 	 	well	for	two	 reason 	 s 	 	.
number	one	,	it	's	the	name	of	my	rock	band	,	and	second	,	is	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 confront 	 ation 	 	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 force 	 d 	 	me	to	 be 	 come 	 	an	inventor	.
and	we	've	since	gone	on	to	develop	 man 	 y 	 	 generation 	 s 	 	of	 gadget 	 s 	 	for	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	 place 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	some	life	-	support	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	closed	-	cycle	.	and	you	can	use	that	now	to	go	for	 man 	 y 	 	 kilometer 	 s 	 	 horizon 	 t 	 ally 	 	 under 	 water 	 	and	to	 depth 	 s 	 	of	200	 meter 	 s 	 	straight	down	 under 	 water 	 	.
when	you	do	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	stuff	it	's	like	 do 	 ing 	 	eva	.	it	's	like	 do 	 ing 	 	extra	-	vehicular	activity	in	space	,	but	at	much	 great 	 er 	 	 distance 	 s 	 	,	and	at	much	 great 	 er 	 	physical	peril	.
so	it	 make 	 s 	 	you	think	about	how	to	design	your	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	for	long	range	,	away	from	a	safe	 have 	 n 	 	.
here	's	a	clip	from	a	national	 geo 	 graphic 	 	movie	that	came	out	in	1999	.
 nar 	 rator 	 	:	exploration	is	a	physical	process	of	 put 	 ting 	 	your	foot	in	 place 	 s 	 	where	 human 	 s 	 	have	never	 steppe 	 d 	 	before	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	where	the	last	little	nugget	of	 total 	 ly 	 	 un 	 known 	 	 territ 	 ory 	 	 remain 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	.
to	experience	it	is	a	privilege	.
bill	stone	:	that	was	taken	in	wakulla	 spring 	 s 	 	,	florida	.
couple	of	 thing 	 s 	 	to	note	about	that	movie	.	every	piece	of	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	that	you	saw	in	there	did	not	exist	before	1999	.
it	was	 develop 	 ed 	 	 with 	 in 	 	a	two	-	year	period	and	used	on	actual	 expl 	 or 	 atory 	 	 project 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	gadget	you	see	right	here	was	 call 	 ed 	 	the	digital	wall	mapper	,	and	it	 produce 	 d 	 	the	first	three	-	dimensional	map	 any 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	 d 	 one 	 	of	a	cave	,	and	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	be	 under 	 water 	 	in	wakulla	 spring 	 s 	 	.
it	was	that	gadget	that	 serendipitous 	 ly 	 	 open 	 ed 	 	a	door	to	 an 	 other 	 	 un 	 explore 	 d 	 	world	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	europa	.
carolyn	porco	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	 an 	 other 	 	one	 call 	 ed 	 	enceladus	the	other	day	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	 place 	 s 	 	where	planetary	 scientist 	 s 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	there	is	a	highest	 prob 	 ability 	 	of	the	 detect 	 ion 	 	of	the	first	life	off	earth	in	the	ocean	that	 exist 	 s 	 	 be 	 low 	 	there	.
for	 t 	 hose 	 	who	have	never	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	story	,	jim	cameron	 produce 	 d 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	imax	movie	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 alien 	 s 	 	of	the	deep	.	``	there	was	a	brief	clip	--	 nar 	 rator 	 	:	a	mission	to	explore	under	the	ice	of	europa	would	be	the	ultimate	robotic	 challeng 	 e 	 	.
europa	is	so	far	away	that	even	at	the	speed	of	light	,	it	would	take	more	than	an	hour	for	the	command	just	to	reach	the	vehicle	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	smart	 en 	 ough 	 	to	avoid	 terra 	 in 	 	 hazard 	 s 	 	and	to	find	a	good	 land 	 ing 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	on	the	ice	.
now	we	have	to	get	through	the	ice	.
you	need	a	melt	 prob 	 e 	 	.
it	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	a	nuclear	-	heated	torpedo	.	the	ice	could	be	 any 	 where 	 	from	three	to	16	 mile 	 s 	 	deep	.
week	after	week	,	the	melt	 prob 	 e 	 	will	sink	of	 it 	 s 	 	own	weight	through	the	ancient	ice	,	 un 	 til 	 	 final 	 ly 	 	--
now	,	what	are	you	going	to	do	when	you	reach	the	surface	of	that	ocean	?
you	need	an	auv	,	an	autonomous	 under 	 water 	 	vehicle	.
it	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	one	smart	puppy	,	able	to	 navig 	 ate 	 	and	make	 decision 	 s 	 	on	 it 	 s 	 	own	in	an	alien	ocean	.
bs	:	what	jim	did	n't	know	when	he	released	that	movie	was	that	six	 month 	 s 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	nasa	had	funded	a	team	i	 assemble 	 d 	 	to	develop	a	prototype	for	the	europa	auv	.
i	mean	,	i	cut	through	three	 year 	 s 	 	of	 engineer 	 ing 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	design	and	system	 integ 	 ration 	 	,	and	 introduc 	 ed 	 	depthx	--	deep	phreatic	thermal	 explore 	 r 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	the	movie	 say 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	smart	puppy	.
it	's	got	96	 sensor 	 s 	 	,	36	 on 	 board 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	,	100,000	lines	of	 behavior 	 al 	 	 auto 	 nomy 	 	code	,	 pack 	 s 	 	more	than	10	 kilo 	 s 	 	of	tnt	in	 electric 	 al 	 	 on 	 board 	 	 equi 	 valent 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	target	 s 	 ite 	 	,	the	world	's	 deep 	 est 	 	 hydro 	 thermal 	 	spring	at	cenote	zacaton	in	 north 	 ern 	 	mexico	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 explore 	 d 	 	to	a	depth	of	292	 meter 	 s 	 	and	beyond	that	 no 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	part	of	depthx	's	mission	.
there	are	two	 prim 	 ary 	 	 target 	 s 	 	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	here	.
one	is	,	how	do	you	do	science	 auto 	 nomy 	 	 under 	 ground 	 	?
how	do	you	take	a	robot	and	turn	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	field	 micro 	 biologist 	 	?
there	are	more	 stage 	 s 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	here	than	i	've	got	time	to	tell	you	about	,	but	 bas 	 ically 	 	we	drive	through	the	space	,	we	populate	it	with	 environment 	 al 	 	 vari 	 able 	 s 	 	--	 s 	 ul 	 phi 	 de 	 	,	 hal 	 ide 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	.
we	 calcul 	 ate 	 	 grad 	 ient 	 	 surface 	 s 	 	,	and	drive	the	bot	over	to	a	wall	where	there	's	a	high	 prob 	 ability 	 	of	life	.
we	move	 a 	 long 	 	the	wall	,	in	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	 proxim 	 ity 	 	 operation 	 s 	 	,	looking	for	 change 	 s 	 	in	color	.
if	we	see	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 look 	 s 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	we	pull	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	 micro 	 scope 	 	.
if	it	 pass 	 es 	 	the	 micro 	 scopic 	 	test	,	we	go	for	a	 collect 	 ion 	 	.
we	either	draw	in	a	liquid	 s 	 ample 	 	,	or	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	take	a	solid	core	from	the	wall	.
no	 hand 	 s 	 	at	the	wheel	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	all	 behavior 	 al 	 	 auto 	 nomy 	 	here	that	's	 be 	 ing 	 	 conduct 	 ed 	 	by	the	robot	on	 it 	 s 	 	own	.
the	real	hat	trick	for	 th 	 is 	 	vehicle	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	is	a	 disrupt 	 ive 	 	new	 navig 	 ation 	 	system	we	've	 develop 	 ed 	 	,	known	 a 	 s 	 	3d	 s 	 lam 	 	,	for	simultaneous	 local 	 ization 	 	and	mapping	.
depthx	is	an	all	-	 see 	 ing 	 	 eye 	 ball 	 	.
 it 	 s 	 	sensor	 beam 	 s 	 	look	both	forward	and	 back 	 ward 	 	at	the	same	time	,	 allow 	 ing 	 	it	to	do	new	exploration	while	it	's	still	 achiev 	 ing 	 	 geo 	 metric 	 	sensor	-	lock	on	what	it	's	gone	through	 al 	 ready 	 	.
what	i	'm	going	to	show	you	next	is	the	first	fully	autonomous	robotic	exploration	 under 	 ground 	 	that	's	ever	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	may	,	we	're	going	to	go	from	minus	1,000	 meter 	 s 	 	in	zacaton	,	and	if	we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	,	depthx	will	 br 	 ing 	 	back	the	first	 robotic 	 ally 	 	-	 discover 	 ed 	 	division	of	bacteria	.
the	next	step	after	that	is	to	test	it	in	antartica	and	then	,	if	the	 fund 	 ing 	 	 continu 	 es 	 	and	nasa	 ha 	 s 	 	the	 re 	 solution 	 	to	go	,	we	could	 potential 	 ly 	 	launch	by	2016	,	and	by	2019	we	may	have	the	first	evidence	of	life	off	 th 	 is 	 	planet	.
what	then	of	 mann 	 ed 	 	space	exploration	?
the	government	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 announce 	 d 	 	 plan 	 s 	 	to	return	to	the	moon	by	2024	.
the	 success 	 ful 	 	 con 	 clusion 	 	of	that	mission	will	result	in	 in 	 frequent 	 	 visit 	 ation 	 	of	the	moon	by	a	small	number	of	government	 scientist 	 s 	 	and	 pilot 	 s 	 	.
it	will	 leav 	 e 	 	us	no	further	 a 	 long 	 	in	the	general	expansion	of	 human 	 ity 	 	 in 	 to 	 	space	than	we	 we 	 re 	 	50	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
 some 	 thing 	 	fundamental	 ha 	 s 	 	to	change	if	we	are	to	see	common	access	to	space	in	our	 life 	 time 	 	.
what	i	'm	going	to	show	you	next	are	a	couple	of	controversial	 idea 	 s 	 	.
and	i	hope	you	'll	bear	with	me	and	have	some	faith	that	there	's	 cr 	 ed 	 ibility 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	what	we	're	going	to	say	here	.
there	are	three	 under 	 pinning 	 s 	 	of	 work 	 ing 	 	in	space	 private 	 ly 	 	.
one	of	them	is	the	 requir 	 ement 	 	for	 economic 	 al 	 	earth	-	to	-	space	transport	.
the	bert	rutans	and	richard	bransons	of	 th 	 is 	 	world	have	got	 th 	 is 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 sight 	 s 	 	and	i	 salut 	 e 	 	them	.
go	,	go	,	go	.
the	next	thing	we	need	are	 place 	 s 	 	to	stay	on	orbit	.
orbital	 hotel 	 s 	 	to	start	with	,	but	 work 	 shop 	 s 	 	for	the	rest	of	us	 lat 	 er 	 	on	.
the	final	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	piece	,	the	real	paradigm	-	buster	,	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	a	gas	station	on	orbit	.
it	's	not	going	to	look	like	that	.
if	it	 exist 	 ed 	 	,	it	would	change	all	future	 space 	 craft 	 	design	and	space	mission	 plan 	 ning 	 	.	now	,	to	give	you	a	chance	to	understand	why	there	is	power	in	that	 state 	 ment 	 	,	i	've	got	to	give	you	the	 bas 	 ic 	 s 	 	of	space	101	.
and	the	first	thing	is	 every 	 thing 	 	you	do	in	space	you	pay	by	the	 kilo 	 gram 	 	.
 any 	 body 	 	drink	one	of	these	here	 th 	 is 	 	week	?
you	'd	pay	10,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	for	that	in	orbit	.
that	's	more	than	you	pay	for	ted	,	if	google	 drop 	 ped 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 sponsor 	 ship 	 	.
the	second	is	more	than	90	percent	of	the	weight	of	a	vehicle	is	in	 propel 	 l 	 ant 	 	.
thus	,	every	time	you	'd	want	to	do	 any 	 thing 	 	in	space	,	you	are	 liter 	 ally 	 	 blow 	 ing 	 	away	enormous	 sum 	 s 	 	of	money	every	time	you	hit	the	 accele 	 rator 	 	.
not	even	the	 guy 	 s 	 	at	tesla	can	fight	that	physics	.
so	,	what	if	you	could	get	your	gas	at	a	10th	the	price	?
there	is	a	place	where	you	can	.
in	fact	,	you	can	get	it	better	--	you	can	get	it	at	14	 time 	 s 	 	lower	if	you	can	find	 propel 	 l 	 ant 	 	on	the	moon	.
there	is	a	little	-	known	mission	that	was	 launch 	 ed 	 	by	the	 pent 	 agon 	 	,	13	 year 	 s 	 	ago	now	,	 call 	 ed 	 	 cl 	 ement 	 ine 	 	.
and	the	most	 amaz 	 ing 	 	thing	that	came	out	of	that	mission	was	a	strong	hydrogen	signature	at	shackleton	 crat 	 er 	 	on	the	south	pole	of	the	moon	.
that	signal	was	so	strong	,	it	could	 on 	 ly 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 produce 	 d 	 	by	10	trillion	 ton 	 s 	 	of	water	buried	in	the	sediment	,	 collect 	 ed 	 	over	 million 	 s 	 	and	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	by	the	impact	of	 a 	 steroid 	 s 	 	and	 com 	 et 	 	material	.
if	we	're	going	to	get	that	,	and	make	that	gas	station	possible	,	we	have	to	figure	out	ways	to	move	large	 volume 	 s 	 	of	 pay 	 load 	 	through	space	.
we	ca	n't	do	that	right	now	.
the	way	you	 normal 	 ly 	 	build	a	system	right	now	is	you	have	a	tube	stack	that	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 launch 	 ed 	 	from	the	ground	,	and	resist	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 aero 	 dynamic 	 	 force 	 s 	 	.
we	have	to	beat	that	.
we	can	do	it	 be 	 cause 	 	in	space	there	are	no	 aero 	 dynamic 	 s 	 	.
we	can	go	and	use	 infla 	 table 	 	 system 	 s 	 	for	 al 	 most 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	idea	that	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	came	out	of	livermore	back	in	1989	,	with	dr.	lowell	wood	's	group	.
and	we	can	extend	that	now	to	just	about	 every 	 thing 	 	.
bob	bigelow	 current 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	test	article	in	the	orbit	.
we	can	go	much	further	.
we	can	build	space	 tug 	 s 	 	,	 orbit 	 ing 	 	 platform 	 s 	 	for	 hold 	 ing 	 	 cryo 	 gen 	 s 	 	and	water	.
there	's	 an 	 other 	 	thing	.
when	you	're	coming	back	from	the	moon	,	you	have	to	deal	with	orbital	 mechanic 	 s 	 	.
it	 say 	 s 	 	you	're	moving	10,000	feet	per	second	 fast 	 er 	 	than	you	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	be	to	get	back	to	your	gas	station	.	you	got	two	 choice 	 s 	 	.
you	can	burn	rocket	fuel	to	get	there	,	or	you	can	do	 some 	 thing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	.
you	can	 d 	 ive 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 strato 	 sphere 	 	,	and	 precise 	 ly 	 	dissipate	that	 velo 	 city 	 	,	and	come	back	out	to	the	space	station	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	never	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	.
it	's	 risk 	 y 	 	and	it	's	going	to	be	one	hell	of	a	ride	--	better	than	disney	.
the	 tradition 	 al 	 	approach	to	space	exploration	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	that	you	carry	all	the	fuel	you	need	to	get	 every 	 body 	 	back	in	case	of	an	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	.
if	you	try	to	do	that	for	the	moon	,	you	're	going	to	burn	a	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	fuel	 al 	 one 	 	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	a	crew	out	there	.
but	if	you	 s 	 end 	 	a	 min 	 ing 	 	team	there	,	 with 	 out 	 	the	return	 propel 	 l 	 ant 	 	,	first	--	did	any	of	you	 guy 	 s 	 	hear	the	story	of	cortez	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	like	that	.	i	'm	much	more	like	scotty	.
i	like	 th 	 is 	 	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	,	you	know	,	and	i	 re 	 ally 	 	value	it	so	we	're	not	going	to	burn	the	gear	.
but	,	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	 tru 	 ly 	 	bold	you	could	get	it	there	,	 manufactur 	 e 	 	it	,	and	it	would	be	the	most	 dramat 	 ic 	 	 demonst 	 ration 	 	that	you	could	do	 some 	 thing 	 	 worth 	 while 	 	off	 th 	 is 	 	planet	that	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	.
there	's	a	myth	that	you	ca	n't	do	 any 	 thing 	 	in	space	for	less	than	a	trillion	 dollar 	 s 	 	and	20	 year 	 s 	 	.
that	's	not	true	.
in	seven	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	could	pull	off	an	industrial	mission	to	shackleton	and	 demonst 	 rate 	 	that	you	could	provide	commercial	 re 	 ality 	 	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	in	low	-	earth	orbit	.
we	're	living	in	one	of	the	most	 excit 	 ing 	 	 time 	 s 	 	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
we	're	at	a	 magic 	 al 	 	 con 	 flu 	 ence 	 	where	private	wealth	and	 imagin 	 ation 	 	are	 driv 	 ing 	 	the	demand	for	access	to	space	.
the	orbital	 re 	 fuel 	 ing 	 	 station 	 s 	 	i	've	just	 de 	 scribed 	 	could	create	an	 entire 	 ly 	 	new	industry	and	provide	the	final	key	for	 open 	 ing 	 	space	to	the	general	exploration	.
to	bust	the	paradigm	a	 radical 	 ly 	 	different	approach	is	 need 	 ed 	 	.
we	can	do	it	by	jump	-	 start 	 ing 	 	with	an	industrial	lewis	and	clark	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 	to	shackleton	 crat 	 er 	 	,	to	mine	the	moon	for	 resource 	 s 	 	,	and	 demonst 	 rate 	 	they	can	form	the	 bas 	 is 	 	for	a	 profit 	 able 	 	business	on	orbit	.
talk	about	space	 al 	 ways 	 	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	hung	on	 ambigu 	 ities 	 	of	purpose	and	 tim 	 ing 	 	.
i	would	like	to	close	here	by	 put 	 ting 	 	a	 s 	 take 	 	in	the	sand	at	ted	.
i	intend	to	lead	that	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 	.
it	can	be	 d 	 one 	 	in	seven	 year 	 s 	 	with	the	right	 back 	 ing 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	who	join	me	in	making	it	happen	will	 be 	 come 	 	a	part	of	 histo 	 ry 	 	and	join	other	bold	 individual 	 s 	 	from	time	past	who	,	had	they	 be 	 en 	 	here	 to 	 day 	 	,	would	have	 heart 	 ily 	 	approved	.
there	was	once	a	time	when	people	did	bold	 thing 	 s 	 	to	open	the	 front 	 ier 	 	.
we	have	 collect 	 ively 	 	 for 	 gotten 	 	that	 less 	 on 	 	.
now	we	're	at	a	time	when	 bold 	 ness 	 	is	 requir 	 ed 	 	to	move	forward	.
100	 year 	 s 	 	after	 s 	 ir 	 	ernest	shackleton	wrote	these	 word 	 s 	 	,	i	intend	to	plant	an	industrial	flag	on	the	moon	and	complete	the	final	piece	that	will	open	the	space	 front 	 ier 	 	,	in	our	time	,	for	all	of	us	.
