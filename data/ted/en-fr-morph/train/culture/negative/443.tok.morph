i	'm	a	double	 amput 	 ee 	 	,	and	i	was	born	 with 	 out 	 	 fibula 	 s 	 	in	both	 leg 	 s 	 	.
i	was	 amput 	 ated 	 	at	age	one	,	and	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	running	like	hell	ever	since	,	all	over	the	place	.
ss	:	well	,	why	do	n't	you	tell	them	how	you	got	to	georgetown	--	why	do	n't	we	start	there	?
why	do	n't	we	start	there	?
am	:	i	'm	a	senior	in	georgetown	in	the	foreign	service	program	.
i	won	a	full	academic	 scholar 	 ship 	 	out	of	high	school	.
they	pick	three	 student 	 s 	 	out	of	the	nation	every	year	to	get	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 inter 	 national 	 	 af 	 fair 	 s 	 	,	and	so	i	won	a	full	ride	to	georgetown
and	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	there	for	four	 year 	 s 	 	.	love	it	.
ss	:	when	aimee	got	there	,	she	 decide 	 d 	 	that	she	's	,	kind	of	,	 cur 	 ious 	 	about	track	and	field	,
so	she	 decide 	 d 	 	to	call	 some 	 one 	 	and	start	 ask 	 ing 	 	about	it	.
so	,	why	do	n't	you	tell	that	story	?
am	:	 yea 	 h 	 	.	well	,	i	guess	i	've	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 s 	 port 	 s 	 	.
i	 play 	 ed 	 	 soft 	 ball 	 	for	five	 year 	 s 	 	growing	up	.
i	 ski 	 ed 	 	 competitive 	 ly 	 	 through 	 out 	 	high	school	,	and	i	got	a	little	 rest 	 less 	 	in	college	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	n't	 do 	 ing 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	for	about	a	year	or	two	 s 	 port 	 s 	 	-	wise	.
and	i	'd	never	 compete 	 d 	 	on	a	 dis 	 able 	 d 	 	level	,	you	know	--
i	'd	 al 	 ways 	 	 compete 	 d 	 	against	other	able	-	bodied	 athlete 	 s 	 	.
that	's	all	i	'd	ever	known	.
in	fact	,	i	'd	never	even	met	 an 	 other 	 	 amput 	 ee 	 	 un 	 til 	 	i	was	17	.
and	i	heard	that	they	do	these	track	 meet 	 s 	 	with	all	 dis 	 able 	 d 	 	 runner 	 s 	 	,	and	i	 figur 	 ed 	 	,	``	oh	,	i	do	n't	know	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	before	i	 judg 	 e 	 	it	,	let	me	go	see	what	it	's	all	about	.	``
so	,	i	 book 	 ed 	 	 my 	 self 	 	a	flight	to	boston	in	'95	,	19	 year 	 s 	 	old	and	 definite 	 ly 	 	the	dark	horse	 candid 	 ate 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	race	.	i	'd	never	 d 	 one 	 	it	before	.
i	went	out	on	a	 grave 	 l 	 	track	a	couple	of	 week 	 s 	 	before	 th 	 is 	 	meet	to	see	how	far	i	could	run	,	and	about	50	 meter 	 s 	 	was	 en 	 ough 	 	for	me	,	 pan 	 ting 	 	and	 heav 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	had	these	 leg 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	made	of	a	wood	and	plastic	 com 	 pound 	 	,	 attach 	 ed 	 	with	velcro	 s 	 trap 	 s 	 	--	big	,	thick	,	five	-	ply	wool	 sock 	 s 	 	on	--	you	know	,	not	the	most	 comfort 	 able 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	but	all	i	'd	ever	known	.
and	i	'm	up	there	in	boston	against	people	 wear 	 ing 	 	 leg 	 s 	 	made	of	all	 thing 	 s 	 	--	carbon	 graph 	 ite 	 	and	,	you	know	,	shock	 absorb 	 ers 	 	in	them	and	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	--	and	they	're	all	looking	at	me	like	,	ok	,	we	know	who	's	not	going	to	win	 th 	 is 	 	race	.
and	,	i	mean	,	i	went	up	there	 expect 	 ing 	 	--	i	do	n't	know	what	i	was	 expect 	 ing 	 	--	but	,	you	know	,	when	i	saw	a	man	who	was	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	an	entire	leg	go	up	to	the	high	jump	,	hop	on	one	leg	to	the	high	jump	and	clear	it	at	six	feet	,	two	 inch 	 es 	 	...
dan	o'brien	 jump 	 ed 	 	5'11	``	in	'96	in	atlanta	,	i	mean	,	if	it	just	 give 	 s 	 	you	a	 compar 	 ison 	 	of	--	these	are	 tru 	 ly 	 	 accomplish 	 ed 	 	 athlete 	 s 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	 qual 	 ifying 	 	that	word	``	athlete	.	``
and	so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	give	 th 	 is 	 	a	shot	:	heart	 pound 	 ing 	 	,	i	ran	my	first	race	and	i	beat	the	national	record	-	holder	by	three	 hundred 	 th 	 s 	 	of	a	second	,	and	 be 	 came 	 	the	new	national	record	-	holder	on	my	first	try	out	.
and	,	you	know	,	people	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	aimee	,	you	know	,	you	've	got	speed	--	you	've	got	natural	speed	--	but	you	do	n't	have	any	skill	or	 fine 	 s 	 s 	 e 	 	going	down	that	track	.
you	 we 	 re 	 	all	over	the	place	.
we	all	saw	how	hard	you	 we 	 re 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	.	``
and	so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	call	the	track	coach	at	georgetown	.	and	i	thank	god	i	did	n't	know	just	how	huge	 th 	 is 	 	man	is	in	the	track	and	field	world	.
he	's	 coach 	 ed 	 	five	olympians	,	and	the	man	's	 off 	 ice 	 	is	lined	from	floor	to	 ceil 	 ing 	 	with	all	america	 certificate 	 s 	 	of	all	these	 athlete 	 s 	 	he	's	 coach 	 ed 	 	.	he	's	just	a	 ra 	 ther 	 	 intimid 	 ating 	 	figure	.
and	i	 call 	 ed 	 	him	up	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	listen	,	i	ran	one	race	and	i	won	.	.	.	``
``	i	want	to	see	if	i	can	,	you	know	--	i	need	to	just	see	if	i	can	 s 	 it 	 	in	on	some	of	your	 practice 	 s 	 	,	see	what	 drill 	 s 	 	you	do	and	 what 	 ever 	 	.	``
that	's	all	i	 want 	 ed 	 	--	just	two	 practice 	 s 	 	.
``	can	i	just	 s 	 it 	 	in	and	see	what	you	do	?	``
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	we	should	meet	first	,	before	we	decide	 any 	 thing 	 	.	``
you	know	,	he	's	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	what	am	i	 get 	 ting 	 	 my 	 self 	 	 in 	 to 	 	?	``
so	,	i	met	the	man	,	 walk 	 ed 	 	in	his	 off 	 ice 	 	,	and	saw	these	 post 	 ers 	 	and	magazine	 cover 	 s 	 	of	people	he	 ha 	 s 	 	 coach 	 ed 	 	.
and	we	got	to	 talk 	 ing 	 	,	and	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	a	great	 partner 	 ship 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	he	'd	never	 coach 	 ed 	 	a	 dis 	 able 	 d 	 	athlete	,	so	 there 	 fore 	 	he	had	no	 pre 	 conceiv 	 ed 	 	 not 	 ions 	 	of	what	i	was	or	was	n't	 cap 	 able 	 	of	,	and	i	'd	never	 be 	 en 	 	 coach 	 ed 	 	before	.	so	 th 	 is 	 	was	like	,	``	here	we	go	--	let	's	start	on	 th 	 is 	 	trip	.	``
so	he	 start 	 ed 	 	giving	me	four	 day 	 s 	 	a	week	of	his	lunch	break	,	his	free	time	,	and	i	would	come	up	to	the	track	and	train	with	him	.
so	that	's	how	i	met	frank	.
that	was	fall	of	'95	.	but	then	,	by	the	time	that	winter	was	 roll 	 ing 	 	around	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	,	you	're	good	 en 	 ough 	 	.
you	can	run	on	our	women	's	track	team	here	.	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	come	on	.	``
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	no	,	 re 	 ally 	 	.	you	can	.
you	can	run	with	our	women	's	track	team	.	``
in	the	spring	of	1996	,	with	my	goal	of	making	the	u.s.	 para 	 lympic 	 	team	that	may	coming	up	full	speed	,	i	 join 	 ed 	 	the	women	's	track	team	.
and	no	 dis 	 able 	 d 	 	person	had	ever	 d 	 one 	 	that	--	run	at	a	collegiate	level	.
so	i	do	n't	know	,	it	 start 	 ed 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	mix	.
ss	:	well	,	on	your	way	to	the	olympics	,	a	couple	of	 memor 	 able 	 	 event 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	at	georgetown	.
why	do	n't	you	just	tell	them	?
am	:	 y 	 es 	 	,	well	,	you	know	,	i	'd	won	 every 	 thing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	the	 dis 	 able 	 d 	 	 meet 	 s 	 	--	 every 	 thing 	 	i	 compete 	 d 	 	in	--	and	,	you	know	,	training	in	georgetown	and	 know 	 ing 	 	that	i	was	going	to	have	to	get	used	to	 see 	 ing 	 	the	 back 	 s 	 	of	all	these	women	's	 shirt 	 s 	 	--	you	know	,	i	'm	running	against	the	next	flo	-	jo	--	and	they	're	all	looking	at	me	like	,	``	hmm	,	what	's	,	you	know	,	what	's	going	on	here	?	``
and	 put 	 ting 	 	on	my	georgetown	uniform
and	going	out	there	and	 know 	 ing 	 	that	,	you	know	,	in	order	to	 be 	 come 	 	better	--	and	i	'm	 al 	 ready 	 	the	best	in	the	country	--	you	know	,	you	have	to	train	with	people	who	are	 inherent 	 ly 	 	better	than	you	.
and	i	went	out	there	and	made	it	to	the	big	east	,	which	was	sort	of	the	 champion 	 ship 	 	race	at	the	end	of	the	season	.	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	hot	.
and	it	's	the	first	--	i	had	just	gotten	these	new	 s 	 print 	 ing 	 	 leg 	 s 	 	that	you	see	in	that	bio	,	and	i	did	n't	 real 	 ize 	 	at	that	time	that	the	amount	of	 sweat 	 ing 	 	i	would	be	 do 	 ing 	 	in	the	sock	--	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 act 	 ed 	 	like	a	 lubri 	 cant 	 	and	i	'd	be	,	kind	of	,	 piston 	 ing 	 	in	the	socket	.	and	at	about	85	 meter 	 s 	 	of	my	100	 meter 	 s 	 	 s 	 print 	 	,	in	all	my	 glor 	 y 	 	,	i	came	out	of	my	leg	.
like	,	i	 al 	 most 	 	came	out	of	it	,	in	front	of	,	like	,	5,000	people	.
and	i	,	i	mean	,	was	just	 mort 	 ified 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	 sign 	 ed 	 	up	for	the	200	,	you	know	,	which	went	off	in	a	half	hour	.
i	went	to	my	coach	:	``	 pleas 	 e 	 	,	do	n't	make	me	do	 th 	 is 	 	.	``
i	ca	n't	do	 th 	 is 	 	in	front	of	all	 t 	 hose 	 	people	.	my	 leg 	 s 	 	will	come	off	.
and	if	it	came	off	at	85	there	's	no	way	i	'm	going	200	 meter 	 s 	 	.
and	he	just	 s 	 at 	 	there	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
my	pleas	fell	on	deaf	 ear 	 s 	 	,	thank	god	.	 be 	 cause 	 	you	know	,	the	man	is	from	brooklyn	;	he	's	a	big	man	.	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	aimee	,	so	what	if	your	leg	 fall 	 s 	 	off	?
you	pick	it	up	,	you	put	the	damn	thing	back	on	,	and	finish	the	 god 	 damn 	 	race	!	``
and	i	did	.	so	,	he	 ke 	 pt 	 	me	in	line	.
he	 ke 	 pt 	 	me	on	the	right	track	.
ss	:	so	,	then	aimee	 make 	 s 	 	it	to	the	1996	paralympics	,	and	she	's	all	 excit 	 ed 	 	.	her	family	's	coming	down	--	it	's	a	big	deal	.
it	's	now	two	 year 	 s 	 	that	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	running	?
am	:	no	,	a	year	.
ss	:	a	year	.	and	why	do	n't	you	tell	them	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	right	before	you	go	run	your	race	?
am	:	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	well	,	atlanta	.
the	paralympics	,	just	for	a	little	bit	of	 clar 	 ification 	 	,	are	the	olympics	for	people	with	physical	 dis 	 abilities 	 	--	 amput 	 ees 	 	,	 person 	 s 	 	with	cerebral	 pal 	 s 	 y 	 	,	and	wheelchair	 athlete 	 s 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	the	special	olympics	,	which	 deal 	 s 	 	with	people	with	mental	 dis 	 abilities 	 	.
so	,	here	we	are	,	a	week	after	the	olympics	and	down	at	atlanta	,	and	i	'm	just	blown	away	by	the	fact	that	just	a	year	ago	,	i	got	out	on	a	 grave 	 l 	 	track	and	could	n't	run	50	 meter 	 s 	 	.
and	so	,	here	i	am	--	never	lost	.
i	set	new	 record 	 s 	 	at	the	u.s.	nationals	--	the	olympic	 trial 	 s 	 	--	that	may	,	and	was	 s 	 ure 	 	that	i	was	coming	home	with	the	gold	.
i	was	 al 	 so 	 	the	 on 	 ly 	 	,	what	they	call	``	 bi 	 lateral 	 	bk	``	--	 be 	 low 	 	the	knee	.
i	was	the	 on 	 ly 	 	woman	who	would	be	 do 	 ing 	 	the	long	jump	.
i	had	just	 d 	 one 	 	the	long	jump	,	and	a	guy	who	was	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	two	 leg 	 s 	 	came	up	to	me	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	how	do	you	do	that	?	you	know	,	we	're	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	have	a	 plan 	 ar 	 	foot	,	so	we	ca	n't	get	off	on	the	 spring 	 board 	 	.	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	i	just	did	it	.	no	one	told	me	that	.	``
so	,	it	's	funny	--	i	'm	three	 inch 	 es 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	world	record	--	and	 ke 	 pt 	 	on	from	that	point	,	you	know	,	so	i	'm	 sign 	 ed 	 	up	in	the	long	jump	--	 sign 	 ed 	 	up	?	no	,	i	made	it	for	the	long	jump	and	the	100	-	meter	.
and	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	of	it	,	you	know	?
i	made	the	front	page	of	my	 home 	 town 	 	paper	that	i	 deliver 	 ed 	 	for	six	 year 	 s 	 	,	you	know	?
it	was	,	like	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	time	for	shine	.
and	we	're	at	the	 train 	 ee 	 	warm	-	up	track	,	which	is	a	few	 block 	 s 	 	away	from	the	olympic	 stad 	 ium 	 	.
these	 leg 	 s 	 	that	i	was	on	,	which	i	'll	take	out	right	now	--
i	was	the	first	person	in	the	world	on	these	 leg 	 s 	 	.	i	was	the	guinea	pig	.	,	i	'm	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	,	like	--	talk	about	a	tourist	 attract 	 ion 	 	.
 every 	 one 	 	was	taking	 picture 	 s 	 	--	``	what	is	 th 	 is 	 	girl	running	on	?	``
and	i	'm	 al 	 ways 	 	looking	around	,	like	,	where	is	my	 com 	 petition 	 	?
it	's	my	first	 inter 	 national 	 	meet	.
i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	get	it	out	of	 any 	 body 	 	i	could	,	you	know	,	``	who	am	i	running	against	here	?	``
``	oh	,	aimee	,	we	'll	have	to	get	back	to	you	on	that	one	.	``
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	find	out	 time 	 s 	 	.
``	do	n't	worry	,	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	great	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	20	 minute 	 s 	 	before	my	race	in	the	olympic	 stad 	 ium 	 	,	and	they	post	the	heat	 sheet 	 s 	 	.	and	i	go	over	and	look	.
and	my	 fast 	 est 	 	time	,	which	was	the	world	record	,	was	15.77	.
then	i	'm	looking	:	the	next	lane	,	lane	two	,	is	12.8	.	lane	three	is	12.5	.	lane	four	is	12.2	.	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	's	going	on	?	``
and	they	shove	us	all	 in 	 to 	 	the	shuttle	bus	,	and	all	the	women	there	are	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	a	hand	.
so	,	i	'm	just	,	like	--	they	're	all	looking	at	me	like	'	which	one	of	these	is	not	like	the	other	,	'	you	know	?
i	'm	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	,	like	,	``	oh	,	my	god	.	oh	,	my	god	.	``
you	know	,	i	'd	never	lost	 any 	 thing 	 	,	like	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	would	be	the	 scholar 	 ship 	 	or	,	you	know	,	i	'd	won	five	 gold 	 s 	 	when	i	 ski 	 ed 	 	.	in	 every 	 thing 	 	,	i	came	in	first	.
and	georgetown	--	that	was	great	.
i	was	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	,	but	it	was	the	best	training	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	was	atlanta	.
here	we	are	,	like	,	crème	de	la	crème	,	and	there	is	no	doubt	about	it	,	that	i	'm	going	to	lose	big	.
and	,	you	know	,	i	'm	just	 think 	 ing 	 	,
``	oh	,	my	god	,	my	whole	family	got	in	a	van	and	drove	down	here	from	pennsylvania	.	``
and	,	you	know	,	i	was	the	 on 	 ly 	 	female	u.s.	 s 	 print 	 er 	 	.
so	they	call	us	out	and	,	you	know	--	``	 lad 	 ies 	 	,	you	have	one	minute	.	``	and	i	remember	 put 	 ting 	 	my	 block 	 s 	 	in	and	just	 feel 	 ing 	 	 horr 	 ified 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	there	was	just	 th 	 is 	 	murmur	coming	over	the	crowd	,	like	,	the	 one 	 s 	 	who	are	close	 en 	 ough 	 	to	the	 start 	 ing 	 	line	to	see	.
and	i	'm	like	,	``	i	know	!	look	!	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	right	.	``
and	i	'm	 think 	 ing 	 	that	's	my	last	card	to	play	here	;	if	i	'm	not	going	to	beat	these	 girl 	 s 	 	,	i	'm	going	to	mess	 the 	 ir 	 	 head 	 s 	 	a	little	,	you	know	?
i	mean	,	it	was	 definite 	 ly 	 	the	``	 rock 	 y 	 	iv	``	 sens 	 ation 	 	of	me	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	germany	,	and	 every 	 one 	 	else	--	estonia	and	poland	--	was	in	 th 	 is 	 	heat	.
and	the	gun	went	off	,	and	all	i	remember	was	 finish 	 ing 	 	last	and	 fight 	 ing 	 	back	 tear 	 s 	 	of	 frust 	 ration 	 	and	 in 	 credible 	 	--	 in 	 credible 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	just	 be 	 ing 	 	 overwhelm 	 ed 	 	.
and	i	had	to	think	,	``	why	did	i	do	 th 	 is 	 	?	``	if	i	had	won	 every 	 thing 	 	--	but	it	was	like	,	what	was	the	point	?
all	 th 	 is 	 	training	--	i	had	 transform 	 ed 	 	my	life	.
i	 be 	 came 	 	a	collegiate	athlete	,	you	know	.	i	 be 	 came 	 	an	olympic	athlete	.
and	it	made	me	 re 	 ally 	 	think	about	how	the	 achiev 	 ement 	 	was	 get 	 ting 	 	there	.
i	mean	,	the	fact	that	i	set	my	 sight 	 s 	 	,	just	a	year	and	three	 month 	 s 	 	before	,	on	 be 	 coming 	 	an	olympic	athlete	and	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	here	's	my	life	going	in	 th 	 is 	 	direction	--	and	i	want	to	take	it	here	for	a	while	,	and	just	 see 	 ing 	 	how	far	i	could	push	it	.	``
and	the	fact	that	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	for	help	--	how	 man 	 y 	 	people	 jump 	 ed 	 	on	board	?
how	 man 	 y 	 	people	 g 	 ave 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	time	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 expert 	 ise 	 	,	and	 the 	 ir 	 	patience	,	to	deal	with	me	?
and	that	was	 th 	 is 	 	 collect 	 ive 	 	 glor 	 y 	 	--	that	there	was	,	you	know	,	50	people	 be 	 hind 	 	me	that	had	 join 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	experience	of	going	to	atlanta	.
so	,	i	 app 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	 philosoph 	 y 	 	now	to	 every 	 thing 	 	i	do	:	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	back	and	 real 	 izing 	 	the	 progress 	 ion 	 	,	how	far	you	've	come	at	 th 	 is 	 	day	to	 th 	 is 	 	goal	,	you	know	.
it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	focus	on	a	goal	,	i	think	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 recogn 	 ize 	 	the	 progress 	 ion 	 	on	the	way	there	and	how	you	've	grown	 a 	 s 	 	a	person	.
that	's	the	 achiev 	 ement 	 	,	i	think	.	that	's	the	real	 achiev 	 ement 	 	.	ss	:	why	do	n't	you	show	them	your	 leg 	 s 	 	?
am	:	oh	,	 s 	 ure 	 	.
ss	:	you	know	,	show	us	more	than	one	set	of	 leg 	 s 	 	.
am	:	well	,	these	are	my	 pre 	 tty 	 	 leg 	 s 	 	.
no	,	these	are	my	cosmetic	 leg 	 s 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	and	they	're	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
you	've	got	to	come	up	and	see	them	.
there	are	hair	 fol 	 lic 	 les 	 	on	them	,	and	i	can	paint	my	 toenail 	 s 	 	.
and	,	 serious 	 ly 	 	,	like	,	i	can	wear	 heel 	 s 	 	.
like	,	you	 guy 	 s 	 	do	n't	understand	what	that	's	like	to	be	able	to	just	go	 in 	 to 	 	a	shoe	store	and	buy	 what 	 ever 	 	you	want	.
ss	:	you	got	to	pick	your	height	?
am	:	i	got	to	pick	my	height	,	 exact 	 ly 	 	.
patrick	ewing	,	who	 play 	 ed 	 	for	georgetown	in	the	'80s	,	 come 	 s 	 	back	every	summer	.
and	i	had	incessant	 f 	 un 	 	making	 f 	 un 	 	of	him	in	the	training	room	 be 	 cause 	 	he	'd	come	in	with	foot	 inju 	 ries 	 	.
i	'm	like	,	``	get	it	off	!	do	n't	worry	about	it	,	you	know	.
you	can	be	eight	feet	tall	.	just	take	them	off	.	``
he	did	n't	find	it	 a 	 s 	 	 humor 	 ous 	 	 a 	 s 	 	i	did	,	 any 	 way 	 	.
ok	,	now	,	these	are	my	 s 	 print 	 ing 	 	 leg 	 s 	 	,	made	of	carbon	 graph 	 ite 	 	,	like	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	and	i	've	got	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	i	've	got	the	right	socket	.
no	,	i	've	got	so	 man 	 y 	 	 leg 	 s 	 	in	here	.
these	are	--	do	you	want	to	hold	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	?
that	's	 an 	 other 	 	leg	i	have	for	,	like	,	tennis	and	 soft 	 ball 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	shock	 absorb 	 er 	 	in	it	so	it	,	like	,	``	shhhh	,	``	 make 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	neat	sound	when	you	jump	around	on	it	.	all	right	.
and	then	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	silicon	 s 	 heath 	 	i	roll	over	,	to	keep	it	on	.	which	,	when	i	sweat	,	you	know	,	i	'm	 piston 	 ing 	 	out	of	it	.
ss	:	are	you	a	different	height	?
am	:	in	these	?
ss	:	in	these	.
am	:	i	do	n't	know	.	i	do	n't	think	so	.
i	may	be	a	little	 tall 	 er 	 	.	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	can	put	both	of	them	on	.
ss	:	she	ca	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	stand	on	these	 leg 	 s 	 	.	she	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	moving	,	so	...
am	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	i	 definite 	 ly 	 	have	to	be	moving	,	and	balance	is	a	little	bit	of	an	art	in	them	.
but	 with 	 out 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	silicon	sock	,	i	'm	just	going	to	try	slip	in	it	.
and	so	,	i	run	on	these	,	and	have	 shock 	 ed 	 	half	the	world	on	these	.
these	are	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	 simul 	 ate 	 	the	actual	form	of	a	 s 	 print 	 er 	 	when	they	run	.
if	you	ever	watch	a	 s 	 print 	 er 	 	,	the	ball	of	 the 	 ir 	 	foot	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	that	ever	 hit 	 s 	 	the	track	.	so	when	i	stand	in	these	 leg 	 s 	 	,	my	 ham 	 string 	 	and	my	 glut 	 es 	 	are	 contract 	 ed 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	they	would	be	had	i	had	feet	and	 we 	 re 	 	 stand 	 ing 	 	on	the	ball	of	my	feet	.
am	:	it	's	a	company	in	san	diego	 call 	 ed 	 	flex	-	foot	.
and	i	was	a	guinea	pig	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	hope	to	 continu 	 e 	 	to	be	in	every	new	form	of	 prost 	 hetic 	 	 limb 	 s 	 	that	come	out	.
but	 actual 	 ly 	 	these	,	like	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	are	still	the	actual	prototype	.
i	need	to	get	some	new	 one 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	last	meet	i	was	at	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 every 	 where 	 	.	you	know	,	it	's	like	a	big	--	it	's	come	full	circle	.
 mode 	 rator 	 	:	aimee	and	the	 design 	 er 	 	of	them	will	be	at	tedmed	2	,	and	we	'll	talk	about	the	design	of	them	.
am	:	 y 	 es 	 	,	we	'll	do	that	.
ss	:	 y 	 es 	 	,	there	you	go	.
am	:	so	,	these	are	the	 s 	 print 	 	 leg 	 s 	 	,	and	i	can	put	my	other	...
ss	:	can	you	tell	about	who	designed	your	other	 leg 	 s 	 	?
am	:	 y 	 es 	 	.	these	i	got	in	a	place	 call 	 ed 	 	bournemouth	,	england	,	about	two	 hour 	 s 	 	south	of	london	,	and	i	'm	the	 on 	 ly 	 	person	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	with	these	,	which	is	a	crime	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	so	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
and	i	do	n't	even	mean	,	like	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 to 	 es 	 	and	 every 	 thing 	 	.	for	me	,	while	i	'm	 s 	 uch 	 	a	serious	athlete	on	the	track	,	i	want	to	be	 femin 	 ine 	 	off	the	track	,	and	i	think	it	's	so	 import 	 ant 	 	not	to	be	 limit 	 ed 	 	in	any	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	,	you	know	,	your	 mobil 	 ity 	 	or	even	fashion	.
i	mean	,	i	love	the	fact	that	i	can	go	in	 any 	 where 	 	and	pick	out	what	i	want	--	the	 shoe 	 s 	 	i	want	,	the	 skirt 	 s 	 	i	want	--	and	i	'm	 hop 	 ing 	 	to	try	to	 br 	 ing 	 	these	over	here	and	make	them	 access 	 ible 	 	to	a	lot	of	people	.
they	're	 al 	 so 	 	silicon	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 bas 	 ic 	 	,	 bas 	 ic 	 	 prost 	 hetic 	 	limb	under	here	.
it	's	like	a	barbie	foot	under	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	is	.	it	's	just	 s 	 tuck 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	position	,	so	i	have	to	wear	a	two	-	inch	heel	.
and	,	i	mean	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	--	let	me	take	 th 	 is 	 	off	so	you	can	see	it	.
i	do	n't	know	how	good	you	can	see	it	,	but	,	like	,	it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	.
there	're	 vein 	 s 	 	on	the	feet	,	and	then	my	heel	is	pink	,
and	my	 a 	 chill 	 es 	 	'	 tend 	 on 	 	--	that	 move 	 s 	 	a	little	bit	.
and	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	store	.	i	got	them	a	year	and	two	 week 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	a	silicon	piece	of	skin	.
i	mean	,	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	was	,	two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	 th 	 is 	 	man	in	belgium	was	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	god	,	if	i	can	go	to	madame	tussauds	'	wax	museum	and	see	jerry	hall	 replicate 	 d 	 	down	to	the	color	of	her	 eye 	 s 	 	,	looking	so	real	 a 	 s 	 	if	she	 breath 	 ed 	 	,	why	ca	n't	they	build	a	limb	for	 some 	 one 	 	that	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	leg	,	or	an	arm	,	or	a	hand	?	``
i	mean	,	they	make	 ear 	 s 	 	for	burn	 victim 	 s 	 	.
they	do	 amaz 	 ing 	 	stuff	with	silicon	.
ss	:	two	 week 	 s 	 	ago	,	aimee	was	up	for	the	arthur	ashe	 a 	 ward 	 	at	the	espys	.
and	she	came	 in 	 to 	 	town	and	she	 rush 	 ed 	 	around	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	have	to	buy	some	new	 shoe 	 s 	 	!	``
we	're	an	hour	before	the	espys	,	and	she	thought	she	'd	gotten	a	two	-	inch	heel	but	she	'd	 actual 	 ly 	 	 b 	 ought 	 	a	three	-	inch	heel	.
am	:	and	 th 	 is 	 	 pose 	 s 	 	a	problem	for	me	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 mean 	 s 	 	i	'm	 walk 	 ing 	 	like	that	all	night	long	.
ss	:	for	45	 minute 	 s 	 	.	 luck 	 ily 	 	,	the	hotel	was	 terr 	 ific 	 	.
they	got	 some 	 one 	 	to	come	in	and	saw	off	the	 shoe 	 s 	 	.
am	:	i	 s 	 aid 	 	to	the	 re 	 ception 	 ist 	 	--	i	mean	,	i	am	just	 har 	 ri 	 ed 	 	,	and	sheryl	's	at	my	side	--
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	look	,	do	you	have	 any 	 body 	 	here	who	could	help	me	?	 be 	 cause 	 	i	have	 th 	 is 	 	problem	...	``
you	know	,	at	first	they	 we 	 re 	 	just	going	to	write	me	off	,	like	,	``	if	you	do	n't	like	your	 shoe 	 s 	 	,	sorry	.	it	's	too	late	.	``
``	no	,	no	,	no	,	no	.	i	've	got	these	special	feet

they	did	n't	even	want	to	go	there	.
they	did	n't	even	want	to	touch	that	one	.	they	just	did	it	.
no	,	these	 leg 	 s 	 	are	great	.
