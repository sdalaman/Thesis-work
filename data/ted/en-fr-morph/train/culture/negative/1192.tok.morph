i	love	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
it	's	true	.
think	about	 every 	 thing 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	us	.
think	about	all	the	 service 	 s 	 	we	use	,	all	the	 connect 	 ivity 	 	,	all	the	 entertain 	 ment 	 	,	all	the	business	,	all	the	commerce	.
and	it	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	our	 life 	 time 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	 pre 	 tty 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	that	one	day	we	'll	be	writing	 histo 	 ry 	 	 book 	 s 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	.	 th 	 is 	 	time	our	generation	will	be	 remember 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	generation	that	got	 on 	 line 	 	,	the	generation	that	built	 some 	 thing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	and	 tru 	 ly 	 	global	.
but	 y 	 es 	 	,	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	true	that	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	serious	 problem 	 s 	 	,	 problem 	 s 	 	with	security	and	 problem 	 s 	 	with	 pri 	 vac 	 y 	 	.
i	've	 s 	 pent 	 	my	 care 	 er 	 	 fight 	 ing 	 	these	 problem 	 s 	 	.
so	let	me	show	you	 some 	 thing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	here	is	brain	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 flop 	 py 	 	 dis 	 k 	 	--	five	and	a	quarter	-	inch	 flop 	 py 	 	 dis 	 k 	 	 infect 	 ed 	 	by	brain	.	a	.
it	's	the	first	virus	we	ever	found	for	pc	 computer 	 s 	 	.
and	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	know	where	brain	came	from	.
we	know	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 say 	 s 	 	so	 in 	 side 	 	the	code	.
let	's	take	a	look	.
all	right	.
that	's	the	boot	sector	of	an	 infect 	 ed 	 	 flop 	 py 	 	,
and	if	we	take	a	 close 	 r 	 	look	 in 	 side 	 	,	we	'll	see	that	right	there	,	it	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	welcome	to	the	 dung 	 eon 	 	.	``
and	then	it	 continu 	 es 	 	,	 say 	 ing 	 	,	1986	,	basit	and	amjad	.
and	basit	and	amjad	are	first	 name 	 s 	 	,	pakistani	first	 name 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	there	's	a	phone	number	and	an	address	in	pakistan	.
now	,	1986	.
now	it	's	2011	.
that	's	25	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
the	pc	virus	problem	is	25	 year 	 s 	 	old	now	.
so	half	a	year	ago	,	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	go	to	pakistan	 my 	 self 	 	.
so	let	's	see	,	here	's	a	couple	of	 photo 	 s 	 	i	took	while	i	was	in	pakistan	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	from	the	city	of	lahore	,	which	is	around	300	 kilometer 	 s 	 	south	from	abbottabad	,	where	bin	laden	was	caught	.
here	's	a	typical	street	view	.
and	here	's	the	street	or	road	 lead 	 ing 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	building	,	which	is	730	nizam	block	at	allama	iqbal	town	.
and	i	 knock 	 ed 	 	on	the	door	.
you	want	to	guess	who	 open 	 ed 	 	the	door	?
basit	and	amjad	;	they	are	still	there	.
so	here	 stand 	 ing 	 	up	is	basit	.
 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	down	is	his	brother	amjad	.
these	are	the	 guy 	 s 	 	who	wrote	the	first	pc	virus	.
now	of	course	,	we	had	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 discuss 	 ion 	 	.
i	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	why	.
i	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	how	they	feel	about	what	they	 start 	 ed 	 	.
and	i	got	some	sort	of	satisfaction	from	 learn 	 ing 	 	that	both	basit	and	amjad	had	had	 the 	 ir 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	 infect 	 ed 	 	 dozen 	 s 	 	of	 time 	 s 	 	by	 complete 	 ly 	 	 un 	 related 	 	other	viruses	over	these	 year 	 s 	 	.
so	there	is	some	sort	of	justice	in	the	world	after	all	.
now	,	the	viruses	that	we	used	to	see	in	the	1980s	and	1990s	 obvious 	 ly 	 	are	not	a	problem	any	more	.
so	let	me	just	show	you	a	couple	of	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	what	they	used	to	look	like	.
what	i	'm	running	here	is	a	system	that	 en 	 able 	 s 	 	me	to	run	age	-	old	 program 	 s 	 	on	a	modern	computer	.
so	let	me	just	mount	some	 drive 	 s 	 	.	go	over	there	.
what	we	have	here	is	a	list	of	old	viruses	.
so	let	me	just	run	some	viruses	on	my	computer	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	let	's	go	with	the	 cent 	 ipede 	 	virus	first	.
and	you	can	see	at	the	top	of	the	screen	,	there	's	a	 cent 	 ipede 	 	 scroll 	 ing 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	your	computer	when	you	get	 infect 	 ed 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
you	know	that	you	're	 infect 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 show 	 s 	 	up	.
here	's	 an 	 other 	 	one	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	virus	 call 	 ed 	 	crash	,	 invent 	 ed 	 	in	russia	in	1992	.
let	me	show	you	one	which	 actual 	 ly 	 	 make 	 s 	 	some	sound	.
and	the	last	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	guess	what	the	 walk 	 er 	 	virus	 do 	 es 	 	?
 y 	 es 	 	,	there	's	a	guy	 walk 	 ing 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	your	screen	once	you	get	 infect 	 ed 	 	.
so	it	used	to	be	 fair 	 ly 	 	easy	to	know	that	you	're	 infect 	 ed 	 	by	a	virus	,	when	the	viruses	 we 	 re 	 	written	by	 hobby 	 ists 	 	and	 teenager 	 s 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	they	are	no	 long 	 er 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	written	by	 hobby 	 ists 	 	and	 teenager 	 s 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	viruses	are	a	global	problem	.
what	we	have	here	in	the	 back 	 ground 	 	is	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	our	 system 	 s 	 	that	we	run	in	our	 lab 	 s 	 	,	where	we	track	virus	 infect 	 ions 	 	 world 	 wide 	 	.
so	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	in	real	time	that	we	've	just	 block 	 ed 	 	viruses	in	sweden	and	taiwan	and	russia	and	 else 	 where 	 	.
in	fact	,	if	i	just	connect	back	to	our	lab	 system 	 s 	 	through	the	web	,	we	can	see	in	real	time	just	some	kind	of	idea	of	how	 man 	 y 	 	viruses	,	how	 man 	 y 	 	new	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	 mal 	 ware 	 	we	find	every	single	day	.
here	's	the	 lat 	 est 	 	virus	we	've	found	,	in	a	file	 call 	 ed 	 	 serv 	 er 	 	.	exe	.
and	we	found	it	right	over	here	three	 second 	 s 	 	ago	--	the	previous	one	,	six	 second 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	if	we	just	scroll	around	,	it	's	just	massive	.
we	find	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	,	even	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	the	last	20	 minute 	 s 	 	of	 mal 	 ware 	 	every	single	day	.
so	where	are	all	these	coming	from	then	?
well	 to 	 day 	 	,	it	's	the	 organize 	 d 	 	criminal	 gang 	 s 	 	writing	these	viruses	 be 	 cause 	 	they	make	money	with	 the 	 ir 	 	viruses	.
it	's	 gang 	 s 	 	like	--	let	's	go	to	gangstabucks.com	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	 oper 	 ating 	 	in	moscow	where	these	 guy 	 s 	 	are	 buy 	 ing 	 	 infect 	 ed 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	.
so	if	you	are	a	virus	writer	and	you	're	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 infect 	 ing 	 	 window 	 s 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	,	but	you	do	n't	know	what	to	do	with	them	,	you	can	sell	 t 	 hose 	 	 infect 	 ed 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	--	 some 	 body 	 	else	's	 computer 	 s 	 	--	to	these	 guy 	 s 	 	.
and	they	'll	 actual 	 ly 	 	pay	you	money	for	 t 	 hose 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	.
so	how	do	these	 guy 	 s 	 	then	 mon 	 et 	 ize 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 infect 	 ed 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	?
well	there	's	 multi 	 ple 	 	different	ways	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 bank 	 ing 	 	trojans	,	which	will	steal	money	from	your	 on 	 line 	 	 bank 	 ing 	 	 account 	 s 	 	when	you	do	 on 	 line 	 	 bank 	 ing 	 	,	or	 key 	 loggers 	 	.	 key 	 loggers 	 	 silent 	 ly 	 	 s 	 it 	 	on	your	computer	,	 hid 	 den 	 	from	view	,	and	they	record	 every 	 thing 	 	you	type	.
so	you	're	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	on	your	computer	and	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	google	 search 	 es 	 	.
every	single	google	search	you	type	is	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	and	 s 	 ent 	 	to	the	 criminal 	 s 	 	.
every	single	email	you	write	is	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	and	 s 	 ent 	 	to	the	 criminal 	 s 	 	.
same	thing	with	every	single	 pass 	 word 	 	and	so	on	.
but	the	thing	that	they	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	looking	for	most	are	 session 	 s 	 	where	you	go	 on 	 line 	 	and	do	 on 	 line 	 	 purchase 	 s 	 	in	any	 on 	 line 	 	store	.
 be 	 cause 	 	when	you	do	 purchase 	 s 	 	in	 on 	 line 	 	 store 	 s 	 	,	you	will	be	 ty 	 ping 	 	in	your	name	,	the	 deliver 	 y 	 	address	,	your	credit	card	number	and	the	credit	card	security	 code 	 s 	 	.
and	here	's	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	a	file	we	found	from	a	 serv 	 er 	 	a	couple	of	 week 	 s 	 	ago	.
that	's	the	credit	card	number	,	that	's	the	 expir 	 ation 	 	date	,	that	's	the	security	code	,	and	that	's	the	name	of	the	owner	of	the	card	.
once	you	gain	access	to	other	people	's	credit	card	information	,	you	can	just	go	 on 	 line 	 	and	buy	 what 	 ever 	 	you	want	with	 th 	 is 	 	information	.
and	that	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	is	a	problem	.
we	now	have	a	whole	 under 	 ground 	 	 market 	 place 	 	and	business	 eco 	 system 	 	built	around	 on 	 line 	 	crime	.
one	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	how	these	 guy 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	are	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 mon 	 e 	 tizing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 operation 	 s 	 	:
we	go	and	have	a	look	at	the	 page 	 s 	 	of	interpol	and	search	for	 want 	 ed 	 	 person 	 s 	 	.
we	find	 guy 	 s 	 	like	bjorn	sundin	,	 original 	 ly 	 	from	sweden	,	and	his	partner	in	crime	,	 al 	 so 	 	 list 	 ed 	 	on	the	interpol	 want 	 ed 	 	 page 	 s 	 	,	mr.	shaileshkumar	jain	,	a	u.s.	citizen	.
these	 guy 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	running	an	operation	 call 	 ed 	 	i.m.u	.	,	a	 cyber 	 crime 	 	operation	through	which	they	 nett 	 ed 	 	 million 	 s 	 	.
they	are	both	right	now	on	the	run	.
 no 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	where	they	are	.
u.s.	 official 	 s 	 	,	just	a	couple	of	 week 	 s 	 	ago	,	froze	a	swiss	bank	account	 belong 	 ing 	 	to	mr.	jain	,	and	that	bank	account	had	14.9	million	u.s.	 dollar 	 s 	 	on	it	.
so	the	amount	of	money	 on 	 line 	 	crime	 generate 	 s 	 	is	significant	.
and	that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	the	 on 	 line 	 	 criminal 	 s 	 	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	afford	to	invest	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 attack 	 s 	 	.
we	know	that	 on 	 line 	 	 criminal 	 s 	 	are	 hir 	 ing 	 	 programm 	 ers 	 	,	 hir 	 ing 	 	 test 	 ing 	 	people	,	 test 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	code	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	back	-	end	 system 	 s 	 	with	sql	 data 	 base 	 s 	 	.
and	they	can	afford	to	watch	how	we	work	--	like	how	security	people	work	--	and	try	to	work	 the 	 ir 	 	way	around	any	security	 pre 	 caution 	 s 	 	we	can	build	.
they	 al 	 so 	 	use	the	global	nature	of	 inter 	 net 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	advantage	.
i	mean	,	the	 inter 	 net 	 	is	 inter 	 national 	 	.
that	's	why	we	call	it	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
and	if	you	just	go	and	take	a	look	at	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	the	 on 	 line 	 	world	,	here	's	a	video	built	by	 clar 	 ified 	 	 network 	 s 	 	,	which	 illustr 	 ates 	 	how	one	single	 mal 	 ware 	 	family	is	able	to	move	around	the	world	.
 th 	 is 	 	operation	,	 believ 	 ed 	 	to	be	 original 	 ly 	 	from	estonia	,	 move 	 s 	 	around	from	one	country	to	 an 	 other 	 	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	the	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	is	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	shut	down	.
so	you	just	ca	n't	shut	these	 guy 	 s 	 	down	.
they	will	 s 	 witch 	 	from	one	country	to	 an 	 other 	 	,	from	one	jurisdiction	to	 an 	 other 	 	--	moving	around	the	world	,	using	the	fact	that	we	do	n't	have	the	 cap 	 ability 	 	to	 global 	 ly 	 	police	 operation 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	the	 inter 	 net 	 	is	 a 	 s 	 	if	 some 	 one 	 	would	have	 give 	 n 	 	free	plane	 ticket 	 s 	 	to	all	the	 on 	 line 	 	 criminal 	 s 	 	of	the	world	.
now	,	 criminal 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 reach 	 ing 	 	us	before	can	reach	us	.
so	how	do	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	go	around	 find 	 ing 	 	 on 	 line 	 	 criminal 	 s 	 	?
how	do	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	track	them	down	?
let	me	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
what	we	have	here	is	one	exploit	file	.
here	,	i	'm	looking	at	the	 h 	 ex 	 	dump	of	an	image	file	,	which	 contain 	 s 	 	an	exploit	.
and	that	 bas 	 ically 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	,	if	you	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	view	 th 	 is 	 	image	file	on	your	 window 	 s 	 	computer	,	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 take 	 s 	 	over	your	computer	and	 run 	 s 	 	code	.
now	,	if	you	'll	take	a	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	image	file	--	well	there	's	the	image	 head 	 er 	 	,	and	there	the	actual	code	of	the	attack	 start 	 s 	 	.
and	that	code	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 encrypt 	 ed 	 	,	so	let	's	decrypt	it	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 encrypt 	 ed 	 	with	xor	function	97	.
you	just	have	to	 believ 	 e 	 	me	,	it	is	,	it	is	.
and	we	can	go	here	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	start	 decrypt 	 ing 	 	it	.
well	the	yellow	part	of	the	code	is	now	 decrypt 	 ed 	 	.
and	i	know	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	look	much	different	from	the	original	.
but	just	keep	 star 	 ing 	 	at	it	.
you	'll	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	that	down	here	you	can	see	a	web	address	:	 un 	 ions 	 eek.com/d/ioo.exe 	 	and	when	you	view	 th 	 is 	 	image	on	your	computer	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	is	going	to	download	and	run	that	program	.
and	that	's	a	 back 	 door 	 	which	will	take	over	your	computer	.
but	even	more	 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	if	we	 continu 	 e 	 	 decrypt 	 ing 	 	,	we	'll	find	 th 	 is 	 	 myster 	 ious 	 	string	,	which	 say 	 s 	 	o	600ko78rus	.
that	code	is	there	 under 	 neath 	 	the	 encrypt 	 ion 	 	 a 	 s 	 	some	sort	of	a	signature	.
it	's	not	used	for	 any 	 thing 	 	.
and	i	was	looking	at	that	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	.
so	 obvious 	 ly 	 	i	googled	for	it	.
i	got	zero	 hit 	 s 	 	;	was	n't	there	.
so	i	spoke	with	the	 guy 	 s 	 	at	the	lab	.
and	we	have	a	couple	of	russian	 guy 	 s 	 	in	our	 lab 	 s 	 	,	and	one	of	them	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	,	well	,	it	 end 	 s 	 	in	rus	like	russia	.
and	78	is	the	city	code	for	the	city	of	st.	petersburg	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	you	can	find	it	from	some	phone	 number 	 s 	 	and	car	 licens 	 e 	 	 plate 	 s 	 	and	stuff	like	that	.
so	i	went	looking	for	 contact 	 s 	 	in	st.	petersburg	,
and	through	a	long	road	,	we	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	found	 th 	 is 	 	one	 part 	 icular 	 	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
here	's	 th 	 is 	 	russian	guy	who	's	 be 	 en 	 	 oper 	 ating 	 	 on 	 line 	 	for	a	number	of	 year 	 s 	 	who	 run 	 s 	 	his	own	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	and	he	 run 	 s 	 	a	blog	under	the	popular	live	journal	.
and	on	 th 	 is 	 	blog	,	he	 blog 	 s 	 	about	his	life	,	about	his	life	in	st.	petersburg	--	he	's	in	his	early	20s	--	about	his	cat	,	about	his	girlfriend	.	and	he	 drive 	 s 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	nice	car	.
in	fact	,	 th 	 is 	 	guy	 drive 	 s 	 	a	mercedes	-	benz	s	600	v	12	with	a	six	-	liter	engine	with	more	than	400	 horse 	 power 	 	.
now	that	's	a	nice	car	for	a	20	-	 some 	 thing 	 	year	-	old	kid	in	st.	petersburg	.
how	do	i	know	about	 th 	 is 	 	car	?
 be 	 cause 	 	he	 blog 	 ged 	 	about	the	car	.
he	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	a	car	accident	.
in	 down 	 town 	 	st.	petersburg	,	he	 actual 	 ly 	 	 crash 	 ed 	 	his	car	 in 	 to 	 	 an 	 other 	 	car	.
and	he	put	 blog 	 ged 	 	 image 	 s 	 	about	the	car	accident	--	that	's	his	mercedes	--	right	here	is	the	lada	samara	he	 crash 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	.
and	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	that	the	 licens 	 e 	 	plate	of	the	samara	 end 	 s 	 	in	78rus	.
and	if	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	take	a	look	at	the	scene	picture	,	you	can	see	that	the	plate	of	the	mercedes	is	o	600ko78rus	.
now	i	'm	not	a	lawyer	,	but	if	i	would	be	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	i	would	say	,	``	i	rest	my	case	.	``
so	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	 on 	 line 	 	 criminal 	 s 	 	are	caught	?
well	in	most	 case 	 s 	 	it	never	 get 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	far	.
the	vast	 major 	 ity 	 	of	the	 on 	 line 	 	crime	 case 	 s 	 	,	we	do	n't	even	know	which	continent	the	 attack 	 s 	 	are	coming	from	.
and	even	if	we	are	able	to	find	 on 	 line 	 	 criminal 	 s 	 	,	 quit 	 e 	 	often	there	is	no	 out 	 come 	 	.
the	local	police	do	n't	act	,	or	if	they	do	,	there	's	not	 en 	 ough 	 	evidence	,	or	for	some	reason	we	ca	n't	take	them	down	.
i	wish	it	would	be	 eas 	 ier 	 	;	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	it	is	n't	.
but	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 so 	 	changing	at	a	 ver 	 y 	 	rapid	pace	.
you	've	all	heard	about	 thing 	 s 	 	like	stuxnet	.
so	if	you	look	at	what	stuxnet	did	is	that	it	 infect 	 ed 	 	these	.
that	's	a	siemens	s	7-400	plc	,	 programm 	 able 	 	logic	[	 controll 	 er 	 	]	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 run 	 s 	 	our	 infra 	 structure 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 run 	 s 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	around	us	.
plc	's	,	these	small	boxes	which	have	no	 dis 	 play 	 	,	no	 key 	 board 	 	,	which	are	 programm 	 ed 	 	,	are	put	in	place	,	and	they	do	 the 	 ir 	 	job	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	the	 elev 	 ators 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	building	most	 like 	 ly 	 	are	controlled	by	one	of	these	.
and	when	stuxnet	 infect 	 s 	 	one	of	these	,	that	's	a	massive	revolution	on	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 risk 	 s 	 	we	have	to	worry	about	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	around	us	is	 be 	 ing 	 	run	by	these	.	i	mean	,	we	have	critical	 infra 	 structure 	 	.
you	go	to	any	 factor 	 y 	 	,	any	power	plant	,	any	chemical	plant	,	any	food	 process 	 ing 	 	plant	,	you	look	around	--	 every 	 thing 	 	is	 be 	 ing 	 	run	by	 computer 	 s 	 	.
 every 	 thing 	 	is	 be 	 ing 	 	run	by	 computer 	 s 	 	.
 every 	 thing 	 	is	 reli 	 ant 	 	on	these	 computer 	 s 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	.
we	have	 be 	 come 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 reli 	 ant 	 	on	 inter 	 net 	 	,	on	 bas 	 ic 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 electric 	 ity 	 	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	on	 computer 	 s 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	which	 create 	 s 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	new	 problem 	 s 	 	for	us	.
we	must	have	some	way	of	 continu 	 ing 	 	to	work	even	if	 computer 	 s 	 	fail	.
so	 prepared 	 ness 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	we	can	do	stuff	even	when	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	take	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	are	n't	there	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 bas 	 ic 	 	stuff	--	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 continu 	 ity 	 	,	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 back 	 up 	 s 	 	,	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	matter	.
now	i	told	you	--	i	love	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.	i	do	.
think	about	all	the	 service 	 s 	 	we	have	 on 	 line 	 	.
think	about	if	they	are	taken	away	from	you	,	if	one	day	you	do	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	them	for	some	reason	or	 an 	 other 	 	.
i	see	 beaut 	 y 	 	in	the	future	of	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	but	i	'm	 worri 	 ed 	 	that	we	might	not	see	that	.
i	'm	 worri 	 ed 	 	that	we	are	running	 in 	 to 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 on 	 line 	 	crime	.
 on 	 line 	 	crime	is	the	one	thing	that	might	take	these	 thing 	 s 	 	away	from	us	.
i	've	 s 	 pent 	 	my	life	 defend 	 ing 	 	the	net	,
and	i	do	feel	that	if	we	do	n't	fight	 on 	 line 	 	crime	,	we	are	running	a	risk	of	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	it	all	.
we	have	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	 global 	 ly 	 	,	and	we	have	to	do	it	right	now	.
what	we	need	is	more	global	,	 inter 	 national 	 	law	 enforce 	 ment 	 	work	to	find	 on 	 line 	 	criminal	 gang 	 s 	 	--	these	 organize 	 d 	 	 gang 	 s 	 	that	are	making	 million 	 s 	 	out	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 attack 	 s 	 	.
that	's	much	more	 import 	 ant 	 	than	running	anti	-	viruses	or	running	 fire 	 wall 	 s 	 	.
what	 actual 	 ly 	 	 matter 	 s 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 find 	 ing 	 	the	people	 be 	 hind 	 	these	 attack 	 s 	 	,
and	even	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	we	have	to	find	the	people	who	are	about	to	 be 	 come 	 	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	 on 	 line 	 	world	of	crime	,	but	have	n't	yet	 d 	 one 	 	it	.
we	have	to	find	the	people	with	the	 skill 	 s 	 	,	but	 with 	 out 	 	the	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	and	give	them	the	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	to	use	 the 	 ir 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	for	good	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
