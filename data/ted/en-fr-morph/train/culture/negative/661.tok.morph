thirteen	trillion	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	wealth	 ha 	 s 	 	 evapo 	 rated 	 	over	the	course	of	the	last	two	 year 	 s 	 	.
we	've	 question 	 ed 	 	the	future	of	 capital 	 ism 	 	.
we	've	 question 	 ed 	 	the	financial	industry	.
we	've	 look 	 ed 	 	at	our	government	 over 	 sight 	 	.
we	've	 question 	 ed 	 	where	we	're	going	.
and	yet	,	at	the	same	time	,	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	well	may	be	a	 semi 	 nal 	 	moment	in	american	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	for	the	consumer	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	take	control	and	guide	us	to	a	new	 tra 	 ject 	 ory 	 	in	america	.
i	'm	 call 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	the	great	 un 	 wind 	 	.	and	the	idea	is	a	simple	,	simple	idea	,	which	is	the	fact	that	the	consumer	 ha 	 s 	 	 move 	 d 	 	from	a	state	of	 anxie 	 ty 	 	to	action	.
 consumer 	 s 	 	who	represent	72	percent	of	the	gdp	of	america	have	 actual 	 ly 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	,	just	like	 bank 	 s 	 	and	just	like	 business 	 es 	 	,	to	de	-	leverage	,	to	 un 	 wind 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	leverage	,	in	 dai 	 ly 	 	life	,	to	 re 	 move 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	from	the	 li 	 ability 	 	and	risk	that	 present 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	move	forward	.
so	,	to	understand	 th 	 is 	 	--	and	i	'm	going	to	stress	 th 	 is 	 	--	it	's	not	about	the	consumer	 be 	 ing 	 	in	 re 	 treat 	 	.
the	consumer	is	 empower 	 ed 	 	.
in	order	to	understand	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	're	going	to	step	back	and	look	a	little	bit	at	what	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	over	the	course	of	the	last	year	and	a	half	.
so	,	if	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	gone	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	easy	cliffsnotes	on	what	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
 un 	 employ 	 ment 	 	up	.	housing	 value 	 s 	 	down	.	 equ 	 ity 	 	 market 	 s 	 	down	.
 commodit 	 y 	 	 price 	 s 	 	are	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
if	you	're	a	mom	 try 	 ing 	 	to	manage	a	budget	,	and	oil	was	150	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	barrel	last	summer	,	and	it	's	 some 	 where 	 	between	50	and	70	,	do	you	plan	 vac 	 ations 	 	?	how	do	you	buy	?
what	is	your	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	in	your	 house 	 hold 	 	?
will	the	 bail 	 out 	 	work	?	we	have	national	debt	,	detroit	,	 curr 	 ency 	 	 valu 	 ations 	 	,	 health 	 care 	 	,	all	these	 issue 	 s 	 	facing	us	.
you	put	them	all	together	,	you	mix	them	up	in	a	bouillabaisse	,	and	you	have	consumer	confidence	that	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	a	 tick 	 ing 	 	time	-	bomb	.
in	fact	,	let	's	go	back	and	look	at	what	 caus 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	crisis	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	consumer	,	all	of	us	,	in	our	 dai 	 ly 	 	 live 	 s 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	 con 	 tribute 	 d 	 	a	large	part	to	the	problem	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	i	call	the	50-20	paradox	.
it	took	us	50	 year 	 s 	 	to	reach	annual	 saving 	 s 	 	 rating 	 s 	 	of	 al 	 most 	 	10	percent	.	50	 year 	 s 	 	.
do	you	know	what	 th 	 is 	 	was	right	here	?
 th 	 is 	 	was	world	war	ii	.	do	you	know	why	 saving 	 s 	 	was	so	high	?
there	was	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	buy	,	 un 	 less 	 	you	 want 	 ed 	 	to	buy	some	 rivet 	 s 	 	.	right	?
so	,	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	,	over	the	course	of	the	last	20	 year 	 s 	 	--	we	went	from	a	10	percent	 saving 	 s 	 	rate	to	a	negative	 saving 	 s 	 	rate	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	 bing 	 ed 	 	.	we	 b 	 ought 	 	extra	-	large	 car 	 s 	 	,	 super 	 sized 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	,	we	 b 	 ought 	 	 remedi 	 es 	 	for	 rest 	 less 	 	leg	syndrome	.
all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	together	 bas 	 ically 	 	 create 	 d 	 	a	factor	where	the	consumer	sort	of	drove	us	 head 	 long 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	crisis	that	we	face	 to 	 day 	 	.
the	personal	debt	-	to	-	income	ratio	 bas 	 ically 	 	went	from	65	percent	to	135	percent	in	the	span	of	about	15	 year 	 s 	 	.
so	 consumer 	 s 	 	got	 over 	 leverage 	 d 	 	.
and	of	course	our	 bank 	 s 	 	did	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	 a 	 s 	 	did	our	federal	government	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 stagger 	 ing 	 	chart	.
it	 show 	 s 	 	leverage	,	 trend 	 ed 	 	out	from	1919	to	2009	.
and	what	you	end	up	 see 	 ing 	 	is	the	whole	 phenomen 	 on 	 	of	the	fact	that	we	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 step 	 ping 	 	forth	and	 bas 	 ically 	 	 lever 	 aging 	 	future	education	,	future	children	in	our	 house 	 hold 	 s 	 	.
so	if	you	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	 con 	 text 	 	of	 visual 	 izing 	 	the	 bail 	 out 	 	,	what	you	can	see	is	if	you	stack	up	dollar	 bill 	 s 	 	,	first	of	all	,	360,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	is	about	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	five	-	foot	-	four	guy	.
but	if	you	stack	it	up	,	you	just	see	 th 	 is 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	,	 stagger 	 ing 	 	amount	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	put	 in 	 to 	 	the	system	to	fund	and	bail	us	out	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	315	billion	.
but	i	read	 th 	 is 	 	fact	the	other	day	,	that	one	trillion	 second 	 s 	 	 equal 	 s 	 	32	thousand	 year 	 s 	 	,	so	if	you	think	about	that	,	the	 con 	 text 	 	,	the	 casual 	 ness 	 	with	which	we	talk	about	trillion	-	dollar	 bail 	 out 	 	here	,	and	trillion	there	,	we	are	 stack 	 ing 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	up	for	long	-	term	leverage	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	 consumer 	 s 	 	have	 move 	 d 	 	.
they	are	taking	 respons 	 ibility 	 	.
what	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	is	an	 up 	 take 	 	in	the	 saving 	 s 	 	rate	.
in	fact	,	11	straight	 month 	 s 	 	of	 saving 	 s 	 	have	 happen 	 ed 	 	since	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	crisis	.
we	are	 work 	 ing 	 	our	way	back	up	to	that	10	percent	.
 al 	 so 	 	,	 remark 	 ably 	 	,	in	the	fourth	quarter	,	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	 drop 	 ped 	 	to	 it 	 s 	 	 low 	 est 	 	level	in	62	 year 	 s 	 	,	 al 	 most 	 	a	3.7	percent	decline	.
visa	now	 report 	 s 	 	that	more	people	are	using	 de 	 bit 	 	 card 	 s 	 	than	they	're	using	credit	 card 	 s 	 	.
so	we	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	pay	for	 thing 	 s 	 	with	money	that	we	have	.
and	we	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	be	much	more	 care 	 ful 	 	about	how	we	 s 	 ave 	 	and	how	we	invest	.
but	that	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	the	whole	story	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	 dramat 	 ic 	 	time	of	 transform 	 ation 	 	.
and	you	've	got	to	admit	,	over	the	course	of	the	last	year	and	a	half	,	 consumer 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	some	 pre 	 tty 	 	weird	 thing 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	 stagger 	 ing 	 	,	what	we	've	lived	through	.
if	you	take	 in 	 to 	 	account	80	percent	of	all	americans	 we 	 re 	 	born	after	world	war	ii	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 essential 	 ly 	 	our	 depress 	 ion 	 	.
and	so	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	,	some	crazy	 thing 	 s 	 	have	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
i	'll	give	you	some	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.	lets	talk	about	 dent 	 ists 	 	,	 vase 	 ctomies 	 	,	 gun 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 hark 	 	 attack 	 s 	 	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
 dent 	 ists 	 	report	 mola 	 rs 	 	,	you	know	,	people	 grind 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 tee 	 th 	 	,	coming	in	and	 report 	 ing 	 	the	fact	that	they	've	had	stress	.
and	so	there	is	an	 in 	 crease 	 	in	people	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	have	 the 	 ir 	 	 fill 	 ing 	 s 	 	 replace 	 d 	 	.
 gun 	 s 	 	,	gun	 sale 	 s 	 	,	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	the	fbi	,	who	 do 	 es 	 	 back 	 ground 	 	 check 	 s 	 	,	are	up	 al 	 most 	 	25	percent	since	january	.
 vase 	 ctomies 	 	are	up	48	percent	,	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	the	cornell	institute	.
and	 last 	 ly 	 	,	but	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	point	,	 hope 	 fully 	 	not	related	to	the	 form 	 er 	 	point	i	just	made	,	which	is	that	 s 	 hark 	 	 attack 	 s 	 	are	at	 the 	 ir 	 	 low 	 est 	 	level	from	2003	.
 do 	 es 	 	 any 	 body 	 	know	why	?
no	one	is	at	the	beach	.	so	there	is	a	bright	side	to	 every 	 thing 	 	.
but	 serious 	 ly 	 	,	what	we	see	 happen 	 ing 	 	,	and	the	reason	i	want	to	stress	that	the	consumer	is	not	in	 re 	 treat 	 	,	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	tremendous	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	for	the	consumer	who	drove	us	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 recess 	 ion 	 	to	lead	us	right	back	out	.
and	what	i	mean	by	that	is	that	we	can	move	from	 mind 	 less 	 	consumption	to	 mind 	 ful 	 	consumption	.	right	?
if	you	think	about	the	last	three	 decade 	 s 	 	,	the	consumer	 ha 	 s 	 	 move 	 d 	 	from	savvy	about	 market 	 ing 	 	in	the	'90s	,	to	 gather 	 ing 	 	all	these	 amaz 	 ing 	 	social	and	search	 tool 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	decade	,	but	the	one	thing	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 hold 	 ing 	 	them	back	is	the	ability	to	discriminate	.
by	 restrict 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	demand	,	 consumer 	 s 	 	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	align	 the 	 ir 	 	 value 	 s 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	,	and	drive	 capital 	 ism 	 	and	business	to	not	just	be	about	more	,	but	be	about	better	.
we	're	going	to	explain	that	right	now	.
based	on	y	&	r	's	brandasset	valuator	,	 prop 	 riet 	 ary 	 	tool	of	vml	and	young	&	rubicam	,	we	set	out	to	understand	what	's	 be 	 en 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	the	crisis	with	the	consumer	 market 	 place 	 	.
we	found	a	couple	of	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
we	're	going	to	go	through	four	value	-	 shift 	 s 	 	that	we	see	 driv 	 ing 	 	new	consumer	 behavior 	 s 	 	,	that	 off 	 er 	 	new	management	 principle 	 s 	 	.
the	first	cultural	value	shift	that	we	see	is	 th 	 is 	 	 tend 	 ency 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	we	call	liquid	life	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 move 	 ment 	 	from	americans	 defi 	 ning 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	success	on	 hav 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	to	 hav 	 ing 	 	 liquid 	 ity 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	less	excess	that	you	have	around	you	,	the	more	nimble	and	fleet	of	foot	you	are	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	result	,	déclassé	consumption	is	in	.
déclassé	consumption	is	the	whole	idea	that	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	money	 frivolous 	 ly 	 	 make 	 s 	 	you	look	a	little	bit	anti	-	fashion	.
the	management	principle	is	 dollar 	 s 	 	and	 cent 	 s 	 	.
so	let	's	look	at	some	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	déclassé	consumption	that	 fall 	 s 	 	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	value	.
first	 thing 	 s 	 	is	we	see	 some 	 thing 	 	must	be	 happen 	 ing 	 	when	p.	diddy	 vow 	 s 	 	to	tone	down	his	bling	.
but	 serious 	 ly 	 	,	we	 al 	 so 	 	have	 th 	 is 	 	 phenomen 	 on 	 	on	madison	 a 	 venue 	 	and	in	other	 place 	 s 	 	,	where	people	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 walk 	 ing 	 	out	of	 luxur 	 y 	 	 bout 	 ique 	 s 	 	with	 ordin 	 ary 	 	,	sort	of	generic	paper	 bag 	 s 	 	to	hide	the	brand	 purchase 	 s 	 	.
we	see	high	-	end	 ha 	 g 	 gling 	 	in	fashion	 to 	 day 	 	.
high	-	end	 ha 	 g 	 gling 	 	for	 luxur 	 y 	 	and	real	 e 	 state 	 	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	see	just	a	 relax 	 ing 	 	of	ego	,	and	sort	of	a	 d 	 ism 	 ant 	 ling 	 	of	artifice	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	story	on	the	yacht	club	that	's	all	 bas 	 ically 	 	blue	collar	.
blue	-	collar	yacht	club	,	where	you	can	join	the	yacht	club	,	but	you	've	got	to	work	in	the	boat	yard	,	 a 	 s 	 	sort	of	condition	of	 member 	 ship 	 	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	see	the	trend	 to 	 ward 	 	 tour 	 ism 	 	that	's	a	little	bit	more	low	key	.	right	?
agritourism	,	going	to	 vine 	 yard 	 s 	 	and	going	to	 farm 	 s 	 	.
and	then	we	 al 	 so 	 	see	 th 	 is 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	forward	from	 dollar 	 s 	 	and	 cent 	 s 	 	.
what	 business 	 es 	 	can	do	to	connect	with	these	new	 mind 	 set 	 s 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
a	couple	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	kind	of	cool	.
one	is	that	frito	-	lay	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	 th 	 is 	 	 liquid 	 ity 	 	thing	with	 the 	 ir 	 	consumer	.
they	found	 the 	 ir 	 	consumer	had	more	money	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	month	,	less	at	the	end	of	the	month	.	so	what	they	did	is	they	 start 	 ed 	 	to	change	 the 	 ir 	 	 pack 	 aging 	 	.
 large 	 r 	 	 pack 	 s 	 	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	month	,	 small 	 er 	 	 pack 	 aging 	 	at	the	end	of	the	month	.	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	too	,	was	the	san	francisco	 giant 	 s 	 	.
they	've	just	 institute 	 d 	 	dynamic	 pric 	 ing 	 	.
so	it	 take 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	account	 every 	 thing 	 	from	the	 pitch 	 er 	 	match	-	 up 	 s 	 	,	to	the	weather	,	to	the	team	 record 	 s 	 	,	in	setting	 price 	 s 	 	for	the	consumer	.
 an 	 other 	 	quick	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	these	 type 	 s 	 	of	 move 	 ments 	 	is	the	rise	of	zynga	.
zynga	 ha 	 s 	 	 ris 	 en 	 	on	the	consumer	's	 desir 	 e 	 	to	not	want	to	be	 lock 	 ed 	 	in	to	 fix 	 ed 	 	-	cost	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	theme	is	about	 vari 	 able 	 	cost	,	 vari 	 able 	 	living	.
so	 micro 	 payment 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 come 	 	huge	.
and	 last 	 ly 	 	,	some	people	are	using	hulu	 actual 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 de 	 vice 	 	to	get	rid	of	 the 	 ir 	 	cable	bill	.
so	,	 re 	 ally 	 	clever	 idea 	 s 	 	there	that	are	kind	of	 be 	 ing 	 	taken	 a 	 hold 	 	and	 market 	 ers 	 	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	understand	.
the	second	of	the	four	 value 	 s 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	 ethic 	 s 	 	and	fair	play	.
we	see	that	play	 it 	 self 	 	out	with	 empath 	 y 	 	and	respect	.
the	consumer	is	 demand 	 ing 	 	it	.
and	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	,	 business 	 es 	 	must	provide	not	 on 	 ly 	 	value	,	but	 value 	 s 	 	.
 increasing 	 ly 	 	,	 consumer 	 s 	 	are	looking	at	the	culture	of	the	company	,	looking	for	 the 	 ir 	 	conduct	in	the	 market 	 place 	 	.
so	,	what	we	see	with	 empath 	 y 	 	and	respect	,	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 re 	 ally 	 	 hope 	 ful 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	have	come	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	 recess 	 ion 	 	.
and	i	'll	give	you	a	few	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
one	is	the	rise	 to 	 ward 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	and	 neighbor 	 hood 	 s 	 	,	and	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	 emphas 	 is 	 	on	your	 neighbor 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	your	support	system	.
 al 	 so 	 	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 by 	 product 	 	of	sort	of	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 lous 	 y 	 	thing	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 un 	 employ 	 ment 	 	,	is	a	rise	in	 volunteer 	 ism 	 	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	 not 	 ed 	 	in	our	country	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	see	the	 phenomen 	 on 	 	--	some	of	you	may	have	``	 boom 	 er 	 ang 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	``	--	these	are	``	 boom 	 er 	 ang 	 	 al 	 um 	 ni 	 	,	``	where	 un 	 ive 	 rs 	 ities 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 re 	 connect 	 ing 	 	with	 al 	 um 	 ni 	 	in	 help 	 ing 	 	them	with	 job 	 s 	 	,	sharing	 skill 	 s 	 	and	 re 	 training 	 	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	character	and	 professional 	 ism 	 	.
we	had	 th 	 is 	 	miracle	on	the	hudson	in	new	york	city	,	you	know	,	in	january	,
and	 sudden 	 ly 	 	sully	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	a	key	name	on	babycenter	.
so	,	from	a	value	and	 value 	 s 	 	 stand 	 point 	 	,	what	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	can	do	is	connect	in	 lot 	 s 	 	of	different	ways	.
 micro 	 soft 	 	is	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	.
they	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 vow 	 ing 	 	to	 re 	 train 	 	two	million	americans	with	i.t	.	training	,	using	 the 	 ir 	 	 exist 	 ing 	 	 infra 	 structure 	 	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	good	.
 al 	 so 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	company	is	gore	-	tex	.
gore	-	tex	is	all	about	personal	 account 	 ability 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	management	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 employ 	 ees 	 	,	to	the	point	where	they	 re 	 ally 	 	kind	of	 sh 	 un 	 	the	idea	of	 bo 	 s 	 s 	 es 	 	.
but	they	 al 	 so 	 	talk	about	the	fact	that	 the 	 ir 	 	 ex 	 ecutive 	 s 	 	,	all	of	 the 	 ir 	 	expense	 report 	 s 	 	are	put	onto	 the 	 ir 	 	company	 intra 	 net 	 	for	 every 	 one 	 	to	see	.
complete	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	.
think	twice	before	you	have	that	bottle	of	wine	.
the	third	of	the	four	 law 	 s 	 	of	post	-	crisis	 consumer 	 ism 	 	is	about	 dur 	 able 	 	living	.
we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	on	our	data	that	 consumer 	 s 	 	are	 real 	 izing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	marathon	,	not	a	 s 	 print 	 	.
they	are	 dig 	 ging 	 	in	.	and	they	're	looking	for	ways	to	 ex 	 tract 	 	value	out	of	every	purchase	that	they	make	.
witness	the	fact	that	americans	are	 hold 	 ing 	 	on	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 car 	 s 	 	 long 	 er 	 	than	ever	before	,	9.4	 year 	 s 	 	on	average	,	in	march	.	a	record	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	see	the	fact	that	 lib 	 r 	 aries 	 	have	 be 	 come 	 	a	huge	resource	for	america	.
did	you	know	that	68	percent	of	americans	now	carry	a	library	card	?
the	highest	 percent 	 age 	 	ever	in	our	nation	's	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
so	what	you	see	in	 th 	 is 	 	trend	is	 al 	 so 	 	the	 accumul 	 ation 	 	of	knowledge	.
 continu 	 ing 	 	education	is	up	.
 every 	 thing 	 	is	focused	on	 better 	 ment 	 	,	and	training	,	and	 develop 	 ment 	 	and	moving	forward	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	see	a	big	diy	 move 	 ment 	 	.
i	was	 fascinate 	 d 	 	to	learn	that	30	percent	of	all	 home 	 s 	 	in	america	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	built	by	 owner 	 s 	 	.
that	 include 	 s 	 	 cottage 	 s 	 	and	the	like	.	but	30	percent	.
so	,	people	are	 get 	 ting 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	 dirt 	 y 	 	.	they	are	 roll 	 ing 	 	up	 the 	 ir 	 	 sleeve 	 s 	 	.
they	want	these	 skill 	 s 	 	.
we	see	that	with	the	 phenomen 	 on 	 	of	raising	 back 	 yard 	 	hens	and	 chicken 	 s 	 	and	 duck 	 s 	 	.	and	when	you	work	out	the	math	,	they	say	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	,	but	the	principle	is	there	that	it	's	about	 be 	 ing 	 	 sustain 	 able 	 	and	taking	care	of	 your 	 self 	 	.
and	then	we	look	at	the	high	line	in	new	york	city	,	an	 excel 	 lent 	 	use	of	 re 	 imagin 	 ing 	 	 exist 	 ing 	 	 infra 	 structure 	 	for	 some 	 thing 	 	good	,	which	is	a	brand	new	park	in	new	york	city	.
so	,	what	 brand 	 s 	 	can	do	,	and	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	,	is	pay	 divid 	 end 	 s 	 	to	 consumer 	 s 	 	,	be	a	brand	that	 last 	 s 	 	,	 off 	 er 	 	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	,	promise	you	're	going	to	be	there	beyond	 to 	 day 	 	's	sale	.
perfect	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	that	is	patagonia	.
patagonia	's	 foot 	 print 	 	 chronic 	 les 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	 go 	 es 	 	through	and	 track 	 s 	 	every	product	that	they	make	,	and	 give 	 s 	 	you	social	 respons 	 ibility 	 	,	and	 help 	 s 	 	you	understand	the	 ethic 	 s 	 	that	are	 be 	 hind 	 	the	product	that	they	make	.
 an 	 other 	 	great	 ex 	 ample 	 	is	fidelity	.
 ra 	 ther 	 	than	instant	cash	-	back	 reward 	 s 	 	on	your	credit	or	 de 	 bit 	 	 purchase 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	about	529	 reward 	 s 	 	for	your	student	education	.
or	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	company	sunrun	.
i	love	 th 	 is 	 	company	.	they	've	 create 	 d 	 	a	consumer	 collect 	 ive 	 	where	they	put	solar	 pan 	 el 	 s 	 	on	 house 	 hold 	 s 	 	and	create	a	consumer	-	based	 util 	 ity 	 	,	where	the	 electric 	 ity 	 	that	they	generate	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	 pump 	 ed 	 	back	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	 market 	 place 	 	.
so	,	it	's	a	consumer	driven	co	-	op	.
so	,	the	fourth	sort	of	post	-	crisis	 consumer 	 ism 	 	that	we	see	is	 th 	 is 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	about	return	to	the	fold	.
it	's	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	right	now	.
trust	is	not	 parcel 	 ed 	 	out	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	all	know	.
it	's	now	about	 connect 	 ing 	 	to	your	 commun 	 ities 	 	,	 connect 	 ing 	 	to	your	social	 network 	 s 	 	.
in	my	book	i	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	the	fact	that	72	percent	of	people	trust	what	other	people	say	about	a	brand	or	a	company	,	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	15	percent	on	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	.
so	,	in	that	respect	,	 co 	 operative 	 	 consumer 	 ism 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	taken	off	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	about	 consumer 	 s 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	together	to	get	what	they	want	out	of	the	 market 	 place 	 	.
let	's	look	at	a	couple	of	quick	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
the	 artisan 	 al 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	is	huge	.
 every 	 thing 	 	about	 local 	 ly 	 	derived	 product 	 s 	 	and	 service 	 s 	 	,	 support 	 ing 	 	your	local	 neighbor 	 hood 	 s 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	 cheese 	 s 	 	,	 wine 	 s 	 	and	other	 product 	 s 	 	.
 al 	 so 	 	 th 	 is 	 	rise	of	local	 curr 	 encies 	 	.
 real 	 izing 	 	that	it	's	difficult	to	get	 loan 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	environment	,	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	business	with	people	you	trust	,	in	your	local	 market 	 s 	 	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	rise	of	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	local	 curr 	 ency 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 phenomen 	 on 	 	.
and	then	they	did	a	 re 	 cent 	 	report	i	thought	was	 fasci 	 nating 	 	.
they	 actual 	 ly 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	,	in	certain	 commun 	 ities 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	start	to	publish	people	's	 electric 	 ity 	 	 us 	 age 	 	.
and	what	they	found	out	is	when	that	was	 avail 	 able 	 	for	public	record	,	the	people	's	 electric 	 ity 	 	 us 	 age 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	 drop 	 ped 	 	.
then	we	 al 	 so 	 	look	at	the	idea	of	cow	-	 pool 	 ing 	 	,	which	is	the	whole	 phenomen 	 on 	 	of	 consumer 	 s 	 	 organ 	 izing 	 	together	to	buy	meat	from	 organ 	 ic 	 	 farm 	 s 	 	that	they	know	is	safe	and	controlled	in	the	way	that	they	want	it	to	be	controlled	.
and	then	there	is	 th 	 is 	 	other	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	that	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	california	,	which	is	about	carrot	 mob 	 s 	 	.
the	 tradition 	 al 	 	thing	would	be	to	boycott	right	?
have	a	stick	?	well	why	not	have	a	carrot	?
so	these	are	 consumer 	 s 	 	 organ 	 izing 	 	,	 pool 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	to	 in 	 cent 	 ify 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	to	do	good	.
and	then	we	look	at	what	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	can	do	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	all	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	about	 be 	 ing 	 	a	community	 organize 	 r 	 	.
you	have	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	you	ca	n't	fight	and	control	 th 	 is 	 	.
you	 actual 	 ly 	 	need	to	organize	it	.
you	need	to	harness	it	.	you	need	to	give	it	meaning	.
and	there	is	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	here	that	we	see	.
first	is	just	the	rise	of	the	fact	that	zagat	's	 ha 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 move 	 d 	 	out	of	and	 divers 	 ified 	 	from	rating	 restaurant 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 to 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	rating	 health 	 care 	 	.
so	what	credentials	 do 	 es 	 	zagat	's	have	?
well	,	they	have	a	lot	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 the 	 ir 	 	network	of	people	.	right	?
so	that	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	force	for	them	to	make	 the 	 ir 	 	brand	more	elastic	.
then	you	look	at	the	 phenomen 	 on 	 	of	kogi	.
 th 	 is 	 	kogi	 do 	 es 	 	n't	exist	.	it	's	a	moving	truck	.	right	?
it	's	a	moving	truck	through	l.a.	,	and	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	you	can	find	it	is	through	twitter	.
or	you	look	at	johnson	&	johnson	's	momversations	.
a	 phenomen 	 al 	 	blog	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	built	up	.
where	j	&	j	 bas 	 ically 	 	is	 tap 	 ping 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	power	of	 mom 	 my 	 	 blogger 	 s 	 	,	 allow 	 ing 	 	them	to	 bas 	 ically 	 	create	a	forum	where	they	can	communicate	and	they	can	connect	.
and	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 come 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 valu 	 able 	 	sort	of	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	revenue	for	j	&	j	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
 th 	 is 	 	plus	the	fact	that	you	've	got	 phenomen 	 al 	 	work	from	ceos	from	ford	to	zappos	,	 connect 	 ing 	 	on	twitter	,	creating	an	open	environment	,	 allow 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 employ 	 ees 	 	to	be	part	of	the	process	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 hid 	 den 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	 wall 	 s 	 	.
you	see	 th 	 is 	 	 ris 	 ing 	 	force	in	sort	of	total	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	and	 open 	 ness 	 	that	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	adopt	,
all	 be 	 cause 	 	the	consumer	is	 demand 	 ing 	 	it	.
so	,	when	we	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	and	we	step	back	,	what	i	 believ 	 e 	 	is	that	the	crisis	that	 exist 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	is	 definite 	 ly 	 	real	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 tremendous 	 ly 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	for	 consumer 	 s 	 	.
but	,	at	the	same	time	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	a	tremendous	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
and	the	chinese	character	for	crisis	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	same	side	of	the	same	 co 	 in 	 	.
crisis	 equal 	 s 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
what	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	with	 consumer 	 s 	 	right	now	is	the	ability	for	them	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	lead	us	forward	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	 recess 	 ion 	 	.
so	,	we	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 value 	 s 	 	-	driven	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	will	force	 capital 	 ism 	 	to	be	better	.
it	will	drive	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
it	will	make	 long 	 er 	 	-	 last 	 ing 	 	 product 	 s 	 	.	it	will	create	better	,	more	intuitive	 custom 	 er 	 	service	.
it	will	give	us	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	connect	with	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	that	share	the	 value 	 s 	 	that	we	share	.
so	,	when	we	look	back	and	step	out	at	 th 	 is 	 	and	see	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	these	 trend 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	in	our	data	,	we	see	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 hope 	 ful 	 	picture	for	the	future	of	america	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
