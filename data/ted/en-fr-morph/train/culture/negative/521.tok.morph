i	want	to	talk	about	the	election	.
for	the	first	time	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	a	 pre 	 domin 	 ant 	 ly 	 	white	group	of	 vot 	 ers 	 	 vot 	 ed 	 	for	an	african	-	american	 candid 	 ate 	 	for	 p 	 resident 	 	.
and	in	fact	barack	obama	did	 quit 	 e 	 	well	.
he	won	375	 elect 	 or 	 al 	 	 vote 	 s 	 	.
and	he	won	about	70	million	popular	 vote 	 s 	 	more	than	any	other	 p 	 resident 	 ial 	 	 candid 	 ate 	 	--	of	any	race	,	of	any	party	--	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
if	you	 compar 	 e 	 	how	obama	did	against	how	john	kerry	had	 d 	 one 	 	four	 year 	 s 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	--	 democrat 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	like	 see 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 transit 	 ion 	 	here	,	where	 al 	 most 	 	every	state	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 blue 	 r 	 	,	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	more	 democrat 	 ic 	 	--	even	 state 	 s 	 	obama	lost	,	like	out	west	,
 t 	 hose 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 be 	 came 	 	more	blue	.
in	the	south	,	in	the	 north 	 east 	 	,	 al 	 most 	 	 every 	 where 	 	but	with	a	couple	of	 exception 	 s 	 	here	and	there	.
one	exception	is	in	massachusetts	.
that	was	john	kerry	's	home	state	.
no	big	surprise	,	obama	could	n't	do	better	than	kerry	there	.
or	in	arizona	,	which	is	john	mccain	's	home	,
obama	did	n't	have	much	 improve 	 ment 	 	.
but	there	is	 al 	 so 	 	 th 	 is 	 	part	of	the	country	,	kind	of	in	the	middle	region	here	.
 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	arkansas	,	tennessee	,	oklahoma	,	west	virginia	region	.
now	if	you	look	at	'96	,	bill	clinton	--	the	last	democrat	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	win	--	how	he	did	in	'96	,	you	see	real	big	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	part	of	the	country	right	here	,	the	kind	of	appalachians	,	ozarks	,	 high 	 land 	 s 	 	region	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	call	it	:
20	or	30	point	 s 	 wing 	 s 	 	from	how	bill	clinton	did	in	'96	to	how	obama	did	in	2008	.
 y 	 es 	 	bill	clinton	was	from	arkansas	,	but	these	are	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 pro 	 found 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	.
so	,	when	we	think	about	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	country	like	arkansas	,	you	know	.
there	is	a	book	written	 call 	 ed 	 	,	``	what	's	the	matter	with	kansas	?	``
but	 re 	 ally 	 	the	question	here	--	obama	did	 relat 	 ively 	 	well	in	kansas	.
he	lost	 bad 	 ly 	 	but	every	democrat	 do 	 es 	 	.
he	lost	no	 wo 	 rse 	 	than	most	people	do	.
but	 yea 	 h 	 	,	what	's	the	matter	with	arkansas	?
and	when	we	think	of	arkansas	we	tend	to	have	 pre 	 tty 	 	negative	 con 	 not 	 ations 	 	.
we	think	of	a	bunch	of	 red 	 neck 	 s 	 	,	quote	,	 un 	 quote 	 	,	with	 gun 	 s 	 	.
and	we	think	people	like	 th 	 is 	 	 prob 	 ably 	 	do	n't	want	to	vote	for	people	who	look	like	 th 	 is 	 	and	are	named	barack	obama	.
we	think	it	's	a	matter	of	race	.	and	is	 th 	 is 	 	fair	?
are	we	kind	of	 stigma 	 tizing 	 	people	from	arkansas	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	part	of	the	country	?
and	the	answer	is	:	it	is	at	 l 	 east 	 	 partial 	 ly 	 	fair	.
we	know	that	race	was	a	factor	,	and	the	reason	why	we	know	that	is	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	people	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	we	did	n't	ask	them	,	but	when	they	 conduct 	 ed 	 	exit	 poll 	 s 	 	in	every	state	,	in	37	 state 	 s 	 	,	out	of	the	50	,	they	 ask 	 ed 	 	a	question	,	that	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	direct	,	about	race	.
they	 ask 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	question	.
in	 dec 	 id 	 ing 	 	your	vote	for	 p 	 resident 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	was	the	race	of	the	 candid 	 ate 	 	a	factor	?
we	're	looking	for	people	that	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	race	was	a	factor	;	 more 	 over 	 	it	was	an	 import 	 ant 	 	factor	,	in	my	decision	,	``
and	people	who	 vot 	 ed 	 	for	john	mccain	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	that	factor	,	 may 	 be 	 	in	combination	with	other	 factor 	 s 	 	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	 al 	 one 	 	.
we	're	looking	for	 th 	 is 	 	behavior	among	white	 vot 	 ers 	 	or	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	non	-	black	 vot 	 ers 	 	.
so	you	see	big	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	in	different	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	country	on	 th 	 is 	 	question	.
in	louisiana	,	about	one	in	five	white	 vot 	 ers 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	one	of	the	big	 reason 	 s 	 	why	i	 vot 	 ed 	 	against	barack	obama	is	 be 	 cause 	 	he	was	an	african	-	american	.	``
if	 t 	 hose 	 	people	had	 vot 	 ed 	 	for	obama	,	even	half	of	them	,	obama	would	have	won	louisiana	 safe 	 ly 	 	.
same	is	true	with	,	i	think	,	all	of	these	 state 	 s 	 	you	see	on	the	top	of	the	list	.
 mean 	 while 	 	,	california	,	new	york	,	we	can	say	,	``	oh	we	're	 enlighten 	 ed 	 	``	but	you	know	,	 certain 	 ly 	 	a	much	lower	incidence	of	 th 	 is 	 	admitted	,	i	suppose	,	 manifest 	 ation 	 	of	racially	-	based	 vot 	 ing 	 	.
here	is	the	same	data	on	a	map	.
you	kind	of	see	the	relationship	between	the	 red 	 der 	 	 state 	 s 	 	of	where	more	people	 respond 	 ed 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	barack	obama	's	race	was	a	problem	for	me	.	``
you	see	,	 compar 	 ing 	 	the	map	to	'96	,	you	see	an	 over 	 lap 	 	here	.
 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 seem 	 s 	 	to	explain	why	barack	obama	did	 wo 	 rse 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	one	part	of	the	country	.
so	we	have	to	ask	why	.
is	 rac 	 ism 	 	 predict 	 able 	 	in	some	way	?
is	there	 some 	 thing 	 	 driv 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	?
is	it	just	about	some	weird	stuff	that	 go 	 es 	 	on	in	arkansas	that	we	do	n't	understand	,	and	kentucky	?
or	are	there	more	 system 	 atic 	 	 factor 	 s 	 	at	work	?
and	so	we	can	look	at	a	bunch	of	different	 vari 	 able 	 s 	 	.
these	are	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 economist 	 s 	 	and	 politic 	 al 	 	 scientist 	 s 	 	look	at	all	the	time	--	 thing 	 s 	 	like	income	,	and	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	education	.
which	of	these	seem	to	drive	 th 	 is 	 	 manifest 	 ation 	 	of	 rac 	 ism 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	big	national	experiment	we	had	on	november	4th	?
and	there	are	a	couple	of	these	that	have	strong	 predict 	 ive 	 	 relationship 	 s 	 	,	one	of	which	is	education	,
where	you	see	the	 state 	 s 	 	with	the	 few 	 est 	 	 year 	 s 	 	of	 school 	 ing 	 	per	adult	are	in	red	,	and	you	see	 th 	 is 	 	part	of	the	country	,	the	kind	of	appalachians	region	,	is	less	educated	.	it	's	just	a	fact	.
and	you	see	the	relationship	there	with	the	racially	-	based	 vot 	 ing 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	.
the	other	 vari 	 able 	 	that	's	 import 	 ant 	 	is	the	type	of	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	that	you	live	in	.
 state 	 s 	 	that	are	more	 r 	 ural 	 	--	even	to	some	 ex 	 tent 	 	of	the	 state 	 s 	 	like	new	hampshire	and	maine	--	they	exhibit	a	little	bit	of	 th 	 is 	 	racially	-	based	 vot 	 ing 	 	against	barack	obama	.
so	it	's	the	combination	of	these	two	 thing 	 s 	 	:	it	's	education	and	the	type	of	 neighbor 	 s 	 	that	you	have	,	which	we	'll	talk	about	more	in	a	moment	.
and	the	thing	about	 state 	 s 	 	like	arkansas	and	tennessee	is	that	they	're	both	 ver 	 y 	 	 r 	 ural 	 	,	and	they	are	 education 	 ally 	 	 imp 	 over 	 ish 	 ed 	 	.
so	 y 	 es 	 	,	 rac 	 ism 	 	is	 predict 	 able 	 	.
these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	among	 may 	 be 	 	other	 vari 	 able 	 s 	 	,	but	these	 thing 	 s 	 	seem	to	predict	it	.
we	're	going	to	drill	down	a	little	bit	more	now	,	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	general	social	survey	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 conduct 	 ed 	 	by	the	university	of	chicago	every	other	year	.
and	they	ask	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 question 	 s 	 	.
in	2000	they	had	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 question 	 s 	 	about	racial	 attitude 	 s 	 	.
one	simple	question	they	 ask 	 ed 	 	is	,	``	 do 	 es 	 	 any 	 one 	 	of	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	race	live	in	your	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	?	``
we	can	see	in	different	 type 	 s 	 	of	 commun 	 ities 	 	that	the	 result 	 s 	 	are	 quit 	 e 	 	different	.
in	 cite 	 s 	 	,	about	80	percent	of	people	have	 some 	 one 	 	whom	they	consider	a	neighbor	of	 an 	 other 	 	race	,
but	in	 r 	 ural 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	,	 on 	 ly 	 	about	30	percent	.
 prob 	 ably 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	live	on	a	farm	,	you	might	not	have	a	lot	of	 neighbor 	 s 	 	,	period	.
but	 never 	 the 	 less 	 	,	you	're	not	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	 interact 	 ion 	 	with	people	who	are	 un 	 like 	 	you	.
so	what	we	're	going	to	do	now	is	take	the	white	people	in	the	survey	and	split	them	between	 t 	 hose 	 	who	have	black	 neighbor 	 s 	 	--	or	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	some	neighbor	of	 an 	 other 	 	race	--	and	people	who	have	 on 	 ly 	 	white	 neighbor 	 s 	 	.
and	we	see	in	some	 vari 	 able 	 s 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 politic 	 al 	 	 attitude 	 s 	 	,	not	a	lot	of	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	eight	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	some	people	 we 	 re 	 	more	republican	back	then	.
but	you	see	 democrat 	 s 	 	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	republican	,	not	a	big	 differ 	 ence 	 	based	on	who	your	 neighbor 	 s 	 	are	.
and	even	some	 question 	 s 	 	about	race	--	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	 affirm 	 ative 	 	action	,	which	is	kind	of	a	 politic 	 al 	 	question	,	a	policy	question	about	race	,	if	you	will	--
not	much	 differ 	 ence 	 	here	.
 affirm 	 ative 	 	action	is	not	 ver 	 y 	 	popular	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	with	white	 vot 	 ers 	 	,	period	.
but	people	with	black	 neighbor 	 s 	 	and	people	with	mono	-	racial	 neighbor 	 hood 	 s 	 	feel	no	 different 	 ly 	 	about	it	 re 	 ally 	 	.
but	if	you	 prob 	 e 	 	a	bit	 deep 	 er 	 	and	get	a	bit	more	personal	if	you	will	,	``	do	you	favor	a	law	 bann 	 ing 	 	 inter 	 racial 	 	marriage	?	``
there	is	a	big	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
people	who	do	n't	have	 neighbor 	 s 	 	of	a	different	race	are	about	twice	 a 	 s 	 	 like 	 ly 	 	to	 oppos 	 e 	 	 inter 	 racial 	 	marriage	 a 	 s 	 	people	who	do	.
just	based	on	who	 live 	 s 	 	in	your	 im 	 mediate 	 	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	around	you	.
and	 like 	 wise 	 	they	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	not	in	2000	,	but	in	the	same	survey	in	1996	,	``	would	you	not	vote	for	a	 qual 	 ified 	 	black	 p 	 resident 	 	?	``
you	see	people	 with 	 out 	 	 neighbor 	 s 	 	who	are	african	-	american	who	 we 	 re 	 	much	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	say	,	``	that	would	give	me	a	problem	.	``
so	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	not	even	about	urban	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	 r 	 ural 	 	.
it	's	about	who	you	live	with	.
 rac 	 ism 	 	is	 predict 	 able 	 	.	and	it	's	 predict 	 ed 	 	by	 interact 	 ion 	 	or	lack	 there 	 of 	 	with	people	 un 	 like 	 	you	,	people	of	other	 race 	 s 	 	.
so	if	you	want	to	address	it	,	the	goal	is	to	facilitate	 interact 	 ion 	 	with	people	of	other	 race 	 s 	 	.
i	have	a	couple	of	 ver 	 y 	 	obvious	,	i	suppose	,	 idea 	 s 	 	for	 may 	 be 	 	how	to	do	that	.
i	'm	a	big	fan	of	cities	.
 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	if	we	have	 cite 	 s 	 	that	are	 divers 	 e 	 	and	 sustain 	 able 	 	,	and	can	support	people	of	different	 ethnic 	 ities 	 	and	different	income	 group 	 s 	 	.
i	think	cities	facilitate	more	of	the	kind	of	 network 	 ing 	 	,	the	kind	of	casual	 interact 	 ion 	 	than	you	might	have	on	a	 dai 	 ly 	 	 bas 	 is 	 	.
but	 al 	 so 	 	not	 every 	 one 	 	 want 	 s 	 	to	live	in	a	city	,	 certain 	 ly 	 	not	a	city	like	new	york	.
so	we	can	think	more	about	 thing 	 s 	 	like	street	 grid 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	where	i	grew	up	in	east	lansing	,	michigan	.
it	's	a	 tradition 	 al 	 	midwestern	community	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	you	have	real	grid	.
you	have	real	 neighbor 	 hood 	 s 	 	and	real	 tree 	 s 	 	,	and	real	 street 	 s 	 	you	can	walk	on	.
and	you	interact	a	lot	with	your	 neighbor 	 s 	 	--	people	you	like	,	people	you	might	not	know	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 toler 	 ant 	 	community	,	which	is	different	,	i	think	,	than	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	which	is	in	schaumburg	,	illinois	,
where	every	little	set	of	 house 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	cul	-	de	-	sac	and	drive	-	through	starbucks	and	stuff	like	that	.
i	think	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	type	of	urban	design	,	which	 be 	 came 	 	more	 pre 	 valent 	 	in	the	1970s	and	1980s	--	i	think	there	is	a	relationship	between	that	and	the	country	 be 	 coming 	 	more	 conserv 	 ative 	 	under	ronald	reagan	.
but	 al 	 so 	 	here	is	 an 	 other 	 	idea	we	have	--	is	an	 inter 	 collegiate 	 	 ex 	 change 	 	program	where	you	have	 student 	 s 	 	going	from	new	york	 a 	 broad 	 	.
but	 frank 	 ly 	 	there	are	 en 	 ough 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	country	now	where	 may 	 be 	 	you	can	take	a	bunch	of	 kid 	 s 	 	from	nyu	,	have	them	go	 stud 	 y 	 	for	a	semester	at	the	university	of	arkansas	,	and	vice	versa	.	do	it	at	the	high	school	level	.
 liter 	 ally 	 	there	are	people	who	might	be	in	school	in	arkansas	or	tennessee	and	might	never	interact	in	a	positive	 affirm 	 ative 	 	way	with	 some 	 one 	 	from	 an 	 other 	 	part	of	the	country	,	or	of	 an 	 other 	 	racial	group	.
i	think	part	of	the	education	 vari 	 able 	 	we	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	before	is	the	 network 	 ing 	 	experience	you	get	when	you	go	to	college	where	you	do	get	a	mix	of	people	that	you	might	not	interact	with	 other 	 wise 	 	.
but	the	point	is	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	good	news	,
 be 	 cause 	 	when	 some 	 thing 	 	is	 predict 	 able 	 	,	it	is	what	i	call	 design 	 able 	 	.
you	can	start	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 solution 	 s 	 	to	solving	that	problem	,
even	if	the	problem	is	 per 	 nic 	 ious 	 	and	 a 	 s 	 	intractable	 a 	 s 	 	 rac 	 ism 	 	.
if	we	understand	the	root	 cause 	 s 	 	of	the	behavior	and	where	it	 manifest 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	and	where	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	,	we	can	start	to	design	 solution 	 s 	 	to	it	.
so	that	's	all	i	have	to	say	.	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
