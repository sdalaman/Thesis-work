 th 	 is 	 	talk	is	about	 right 	 ing 	 	writing	 wrong 	 s 	 	.
no	,	the	sound	's	not	 fault 	 y 	 	--	 right 	 ing 	 	writing	 wrong 	 s 	 	.
the	middle	east	is	huge	,	and	with	all	our	 problem 	 s 	 	,	one	thing	's	for	 s 	 ure 	 	:	we	love	to	laugh	.
i	think	humor	is	a	great	way	to	 celebr 	 ate 	 	our	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	.
we	need	to	take	our	 respons 	 ibilities 	 	 serious 	 ly 	 	,	but	not	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
do	n't	get	me	wrong	:	it	's	not	like	we	do	n't	have	 come 	 dy 	 	in	the	middle	east	.
i	grew	up	at	a	time	when	 icon 	 ic 	 	 act 	 ors 	 	from	kuwait	,	syria	,	egypt	used	laughter	to	 un 	 ite 	 	the	region	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	 foot 	 ball 	 	can	.
now	is	the	time	for	us	to	laugh	at	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	before	 other 	 s 	 	can	laugh	with	us	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	story	of	the	rise	and	rise	of	stand	-	up	 come 	 dy 	 	in	the	middle	east	--	a	stand	-	up	 up 	 ris 	 ing 	 	,	if	you	will	.
 work 	 ing 	 	in	london	 a 	 s 	 	tv	maker	and	writer	,	i	 quick 	 ly 	 	 real 	 ized 	 	that	 come 	 dy 	 	 connect 	 s 	 	 audience 	 s 	 	.
now	,	the	best	 breed 	 ing 	 	ground	for	good	 com 	 ic 	 	writing	is	the	stand	-	up	 come 	 dy 	 	circuit	,	where	they	just	happen	to	say	that	you	kill	when	you	do	well	and	you	bomb	when	you	do	 bad 	 ly 	 	.
an	 un 	 fortunate 	 	 connect 	 ion 	 	for	us	 may 	 be 	 	,	but	it	 re 	 mind 	 s 	 	me	that	we	'd	like	to	thank	one	man	for	,	over	the	past	decade	,	 work 	 ing 	 	 tire 	 lessly 	 	to	support	 comedian 	 s 	 	all	around	the	world	,	 specific 	 ally 	 	 comedian 	 s 	 	with	a	middle	eastern	 back 	 ground 	 	.
like	my	good	 friend 	 s 	 	,	dean	and	maysoon	,	at	the	bottom	of	the	screen	,	who	,	two	 year 	 s 	 	after	9/11	,	 start 	 ed 	 	a	 fest 	 ival 	 	to	change	the	way	middle	easterners	are	 perceive 	 d 	 	in	the	world	.
it	's	still	going	strong	,	with	positive	press	to	die	for	.
 al 	 so 	 	,	three	 guy 	 s 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	for	 year 	 s 	 	in	los	angeles	,	an	iranian	,	a	palestinian	and	an	egyptian	,	 create 	 d 	 	the	 apt 	 ly 	 	named	axis	of	 e 	 vil 	 	 come 	 dy 	 	act	.
and	 where 	 ver 	 	they	went	,	they	 kill 	 ed 	 	.
now	,	i	did	n't	start	 th 	 is 	 	fire	,	but	i	did	pour	 petro 	 l 	 	on	it	.
i	 move 	 d 	 	to	dubai	 a 	 s 	 	the	head	of	original	content	for	a	western	tv	network	.
my	job	was	to	connect	the	brand	with	a	middle	eastern	audience	.
now	,	the	american	head	of	 programm 	 ing 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	new	local	arabic	 come 	 dy 	 	.
in	a	thick	arabic	accent	,	my	brain	went	,	``	berfect	.	``
now	,	i	had	 friend 	 s 	 	in	the	u.s.	who	had	 start 	 ed 	 	a	 success 	 ful 	 	new	tribe	.
and	i	had	every	 intent 	 ion 	 	of	taking	 th 	 is 	 	tribe	from	 be 	 ing 	 	 out 	 lier 	 s 	 	in	the	middle	east	and	 push 	 ing 	 	them	over	the	 tip 	 ping 	 	point	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	success	.
now	,	 a 	 s 	 	with	any	new	idea	,	it	was	n't	easy	.
i	had	four	 phase 	 s 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	plan	.
first	,	we	'd	need	to	buy	content	from	the	west	and	air	it	.
then	i	'd	 br 	 ing 	 	my	 friend 	 s 	 	,	and	we	'd	show	local	 amateur 	 s 	 	how	it	's	 d 	 one 	 	.
we	would	film	that	and	air	it	,	and	then	i	could	work	with	the	local	 amateur 	 s 	 	and	write	new	 come 	 dy 	 	.
i	 excit 	 ed 	 ly 	 	 present 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	to	the	big	 bo 	 s 	 s 	 	,	and	his	 re 	 action 	 	was	,	``	um	,	i	do	n't	get	it	.	``
so	i	 re 	 treat 	 ed 	 	back	to	my	cave	and	 continu 	 ed 	 	to	support	and	produce	 come 	 dy 	 	and	let	my	 friend 	 s 	 	use	my	couch	 a 	 s 	 	a	 region 	 al 	 	 operation 	 s 	 	hub	.
now	,	fast	forward	two	 year 	 s 	 	,	to	early	2007	.
the	earth	 rot 	 ated 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	did	our	management	,
and	 a 	 s 	 	if	by	divine	intervention	,	 thing 	 s 	 	came	together	to	help	 th 	 is 	 	revolution	take	shape	.
here	's	how	the	 dot 	 s 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	.
first	,	the	axis	 guy 	 s 	 	 record 	 ed 	 	a	 come 	 dy 	 	central	special	that	 air 	 ed 	 	in	the	 state 	 s 	 	,	and	it	was	 get 	 ting 	 	great	 hit 	 s 	 	on	youtube	.
our	new	french	ceo	 believ 	 ed 	 	in	the	power	of	positive	pr	...	and	 idea 	 s 	 	du	bon	 march 	 e 	 	.
let	's	just	say	``	value	for	money	.	``
i	 produce 	 d 	 	in	dubai	a	show	for	ahmed	ahmed	to	 show 	 case 	 	his	new	axis	special	to	a	 pack 	 ed 	 	room	.
i	 invit 	 ed 	 	our	new	ceo	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	he	 real 	 ized 	 	we	had	a	room	 pack 	 ed 	 	full	of	 laugh 	 ing 	 	 infidel 	 s 	 	,	his	 re 	 action 	 	was	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	:	``	let	's	make	 th 	 is 	 	happen	.
and	one	more	thing	:	no	,	do	n't	f	it	up	.	``
so	i	 quick 	 ly 	 	went	to	work	with	a	great	team	around	me	.
i	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	find	a	funny	guy	to	present	it	in	arabic	,	who	is	 original 	 ly 	 	korean	,	a	perfect	fit	for	the	axis	of	 e 	 vil 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	all	true	.
now	,	while	 pre 	 par 	 ing 	 	for	the	tour	,	i	had	to	 re 	 mind 	 	the	 guy 	 s 	 	to	be	 cultural 	 ly 	 	sensitive	.
i	used	the	three	bs	of	stand	-	up	 do 	 n't 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	i	call	them	in	the	middle	east	:	blue	content	,	keep	it	clean	;	 belief 	 s 	 	,	not	 relig 	 ion 	 	;	and	the	third	b	,	 boli 	 tics 	 	.
stay	away	from	 boli 	 tics 	 	in	the	middle	east	.
oh	course	,	you	might	think	,	what	's	left	 with 	 out 	 	 boli 	 tics 	 	,	 s 	 ex 	 	and	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	how	can	you	make	people	laugh	?
i	'd	say	,	watch	any	 success 	 ful 	 	well	-	written	,	family	-	friendly	sitcom	in	the	west	for	your	 answer 	 s 	 	.
now	,	 we 	 re 	 	the	axis	 success 	 ful 	 	?
in	five	 count 	 ries 	 	,	in	just	under	a	month	,	we	had	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 fanatic 	 al 	 	 fan 	 s 	 	come	and	see	them	live	.
we	had	 million 	 s 	 	see	them	on	tv	and	on	tv	news	.
in	jordan	,	we	had	his	 majes 	 ty 	 	the	king	come	and	see	them	.
in	fact	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	so	 success 	 ful 	 	that	you	could	buy	a	 pirate 	 d 	 	copy	of	 the 	 ir 	 	dvd	,	even	before	it	was	released	in	the	middle	east	.
 any 	 where 	 	you	go	.
so	 every 	 where 	 	we	went	,	we	 audition 	 ed 	 	 amateur 	 s 	 	.
we	 film 	 ed 	 	that	process	and	 air 	 ed 	 	a	 document 	 ary 	 	.
i	 call 	 ed 	 	it	``	three	 guy 	 s 	 	and	wonho	.	``
it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	his	name	.
and	all	 th 	 is 	 	tv	and	 inter 	 net 	 	 expo 	 s 	 ure 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	led	to	a	great	 man 	 y 	 	 recruit 	 s 	 	to	our	cause	.
in	dubai	 th 	 is 	 	year	,	we	've	just	had	the	first	all	-	women	's	,	 home 	 grown 	 	stand	-	up	show	.
and	notice	two	of	them	are	 wear 	 ing 	 	 head 	 s 	 carve 	 s 	 	,	and	 y 	 es 	 	,	even	they	can	laugh	.
dubai	,	to	me	,	is	like	a	hand	that	 support 	 s 	 	 any 	 one 	 	who	 want 	 s 	 	to	make	 thing 	 s 	 	happen	.
20	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	no	one	had	heard	of	it	.
look	at	it	now	.
with	an	 inspiration 	 al 	 	 lead 	 er 	 	,	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	year	,	the	 open 	 ing 	 	of	the	 tall 	 est 	 	tower	in	the	world	is	like	 add 	 ing 	 	a	finger	to	that	hand	,	that	 point 	 s 	 	at	all	 t 	 hose 	 	who	spread	 fall 	 acious 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	about	us	.
now	,	in	three	short	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	've	come	a	long	way	with	stand	-	up	 come 	 dy 	 	 show 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	even	in	saudi	arabia	.
these	 com 	 ic 	 s 	 	are	now	going	to	the	new	york	 fest 	 ival 	 	.
and	the	lebanese	,	 brilli 	 ant 	 	lebanese	,	nemr	abou	nassar	,	we	 feature 	 d 	 	in	our	first	tour	,	 ha 	 s 	 	just	 be 	 en 	 	 perform 	 ing 	 	in	l.a.	's	 legend 	 ary 	 	 come 	 dy 	 	 club 	 s 	 	.
so	 clear 	 ly 	 	,	from	the	 in 	 side 	 	,	we	are	 do 	 ing 	 	our	best	to	change	our	image	,	and	it	's	 expl 	 o 	 d 	 ing 	 	.
so	,	 a 	 s 	 	for	the	 out 	 sider 	 s 	 	looking	in	,	watch	the	cnn	report	on	the	second	amman	 come 	 dy 	 	 fest 	 ival 	 	.
the	 report 	 er 	 	did	a	great	job	,	and	i	thank	her	,	but	 some 	 body 	 	 for 	 got 	 	to	 s 	 end 	 	the	positive	pr	email	to	the	person	 oper 	 ating 	 	the	 autom 	 atic 	 	news	 tick 	 er 	 	that	 appear 	 s 	 	at	the	bottom	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	when	dean	 talk 	 s 	 	,	the	 tick 	 er 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	u.s.	:	suspect	 g 	 ave 	 	'	 action 	 able 	 	 in 	 tel 	 	.	``
well	,	if	you	're	used	to	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	 comedian 	 s 	 	,	then	i	'm	not	 surprise 	 d 	 	.
 s 	 ad 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 lead 	 s 	 	me	to	 an 	 other 	 	three	bs	that	 represent 	 s 	 	how	the	media	in	the	west	 talk 	 s 	 	about	us	 a 	 s 	 	 bomb 	 ers 	 	,	 billion 	 aire 	 s 	 	and	 bel 	 ly 	 	 danc 	 ers 	 	.	 en 	 ough 	 	.
we	're	not	all	 ang 	 ry 	 	 fanatic 	 s 	 	who	want	to	kill	the	infidel	.
we	have	a	positive	story	to	tell	and	image	to	sell	.
in	fact	,	one	thing	's	for	 s 	 ure 	 	,	in	my	experience	,	we	love	to	laugh	like	hell	.
here	are	three	 question 	 s 	 	that	i	like	to	use	to	test	the	 truth 	 iness 	 	of	our	 represent 	 ation 	 	in	any	media	story	.
one	:	is	the	middle	east	 be 	 ing 	 	 show 	 n 	 	in	a	current	time	and	correct	 con 	 text 	 	?
two	:	do	the	middle	eastern	 character 	 s 	 	laugh	or	 s 	 mile 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 show 	 ing 	 	the	 white 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	?
three	:	is	the	middle	eastern	character	 be 	 ing 	 	 play 	 ed 	 	by	one	?
 clear 	 ly 	 	,	there	are	 wrong 	 s 	 	that	need	to	be	 right 	 ed 	 	.
we	've	 start 	 ed 	 	in	our	region	.
my	 challeng 	 e 	 	to	the	rest	of	the	world	is	 pleas 	 e 	 	,	start	using	positive	middle	eastern	 image 	 s 	 	in	your	 st 	 ories 	 	.
for	inspiration	,	go	to	one	of	our	 fest 	 ival 	 s 	 	,	go	 on 	 line 	 	,	drop	us	a	line	.
let	's	change	the	narrative	together	and	let	's	start	 right 	 ing 	 	writing	 wrong 	 s 	 	.
i	'd	like	to	end	,	before	going	back	to	the	middle	east	,	with	a	quote	from	one	of	the	 great 	 est 	 	sheikhs	to	put	 qu 	 ill 	 	to	 par 	 ch 	 ment 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	my	father	 like 	 s 	 	to	call	him	,	``	asheikh	azubare	;	``	 a 	 s 	 	my	mother	would	say	,	``	shakespeare	.	``
``	and	now	we	go	in	content
to	 liber 	 ty 	 	and	not	to	 banish 	 ment 	 	.	``
thank	you	.
