you	know	,	i	'm	 s 	 truck 	 	by	how	one	of	the	 im 	 plicit 	 	 theme 	 s 	 	of	ted	is	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	these	 ver 	 y 	 	moving	 demonst 	 ration 	 s 	 	we	've	just	 s 	 een 	 	:	hiv	in	africa	,	 p 	 resident 	 	clinton	last	night	.	and	i	'd	like	to	do	a	little	 col 	 lateral 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	,	if	you	will	,	about	 compass 	 ion 	 	and	 br 	 ing 	 	it	from	the	global	level	to	the	personal	.	i	'm	a	 psycho 	 logist 	 	,	but	rest	 assur 	 ed 	 	,	i	will	not	 br 	 ing 	 	it	to	the	scrotal	.
there	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	 d 	 one 	 	a	while	ago	at	princeton	theological	seminary	that	 speak 	 s 	 	to	why	it	is	that	when	all	of	us	have	so	 man 	 y 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	to	help	,	we	do	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	and	we	do	n't	other	 time 	 s 	 	.
a	group	of	 div 	 in 	 ity 	 	 student 	 s 	 	at	the	princeton	theological	seminary	 we 	 re 	 	told	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	give	a	practice	sermon	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	each	 give 	 n 	 	a	sermon	 top 	 ic 	 	.
half	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 student 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 give 	 n 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 top 	 ic 	 	,	the	 par 	 able 	 	of	the	good	samaritan	:	the	man	who	 stop 	 ped 	 	the	 strange 	 r 	 	in	--	to	help	the	 strange 	 r 	 	in	need	by	the	side	of	the	road	.
half	 we 	 re 	 	 give 	 n 	 	random	 b 	 ible 	 	 top 	 ic 	 s 	 	.
then	one	by	one	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	told	they	had	to	go	to	 an 	 other 	 	building	and	give	 the 	 ir 	 	sermon	.
 a 	 s 	 	they	went	from	the	first	building	to	the	second	,	each	of	them	 pass 	 ed 	 	a	man	who	was	bent	over	and	 moan 	 ing 	 	,	 clear 	 ly 	 	in	need	.	the	question	is	:	did	they	stop	to	help	?	the	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	question	is	:	did	it	matter	they	 we 	 re 	 	 contempl 	 ating 	 	the	 par 	 able 	 	of	the	good	samaritan	?	answer	:	no	,	not	at	all	.
what	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	determine	 whet 	 her 	 	 some 	 one 	 	would	stop	and	help	a	 strange 	 r 	 	in	need	was	how	much	of	a	 hur 	 ry 	 	they	thought	they	 we 	 re 	 	in	--	 we 	 re 	 	they	 feel 	 ing 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	late	,	or	 we 	 re 	 	they	 absorb 	 ed 	 	in	what	they	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	talk	about	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	i	think	,	the	 pre 	 dica 	 ment 	 	of	our	 live 	 s 	 	:	that	we	do	n't	take	every	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	help	 be 	 cause 	 	our	focus	is	in	the	wrong	direction	.
there	's	a	new	field	in	brain	science	,	social	 neuro 	 science 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	the	 circuit 	 ry 	 	in	two	people	's	 brain 	 s 	 	that	 activate 	 s 	 	while	they	interact	.
and	the	new	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 compass 	 ion 	 	from	social	 neuro 	 science 	 	is	that	our	default	wiring	is	to	help	.
that	is	to	say	,	if	we	attend	to	the	other	person	,	we	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	 empath 	 ize 	 	,	we	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	feel	with	them	.
there	are	these	 new 	 ly 	 	identified	 neuro 	 ns 	 	,	mirror	 neuro 	 ns 	 	,	that	act	like	a	neuro	wi	-	fi	,	 activ 	 ating 	 	in	our	brain	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	 area 	 s 	 	 activate 	 d 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 s 	 	.	we	feel	``	with	``	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	.
and	if	that	person	is	in	need	,	if	that	person	is	 suffer 	 ing 	 	,	we	're	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	prepared	to	help	.	at	 l 	 east 	 	that	's	the	argument	.
but	then	the	question	is	:	why	do	n't	we	?
and	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	 speak 	 s 	 	to	a	spectrum	that	 go 	 es 	 	from	complete	self	-	absorption	,	to	 not 	 ic 	 ing 	 	,	to	 empath 	 y 	 	and	to	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
and	the	simple	fact	is	,	if	we	are	focused	on	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	if	we	're	 pre 	 occupied 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	so	often	are	 through 	 out 	 	the	day	,	we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	fully	notice	the	other	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	the	self	and	the	other	focus	can	be	 ver 	 y 	 	subtle	.
i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	my	 tax 	 es 	 	the	other	day	,	and	i	got	to	the	point	where	i	was	 list 	 ing 	 	all	of	the	 don 	 ations 	 	i	 g 	 ave 	 	,	and	i	had	an	 epiph 	 any 	 	,	it	was	--	i	came	to	my	check	to	the	seva	 found 	 ation 	 	and	i	 notice 	 d 	 	that	i	thought	,	boy	,	my	friend	larry	 brilli 	 ant 	 	would	 re 	 ally 	 	be	happy	that	i	 g 	 ave 	 	money	to	seva	.	then	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	what	i	was	 get 	 ting 	 	from	giving	was	a	 narcissist 	 ic 	 	hit	--	that	i	felt	good	about	 my 	 self 	 	.
then	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	think	about	the	people	in	the	himalayas	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 cataract 	 s 	 	would	be	 help 	 ed 	 	,	and	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	i	went	from	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 narcissist 	 ic 	 	self	-	focus	to	 altruist 	 ic 	 	joy	,	to	 feel 	 ing 	 	good	for	the	people	that	 we 	 re 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 help 	 ed 	 	.	i	think	that	's	a	 motiv 	 ator 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	 distinct 	 ion 	 	between	 focus 	 ing 	 	on	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	 focus 	 ing 	 	on	 other 	 s 	 	is	one	that	i	 encourag 	 e 	 	us	all	to	pay	attention	to	.
you	can	see	it	at	a	gross	level	in	the	world	of	 d 	 ating 	 	.
i	was	at	a	sushi	restaurant	a	while	back	and	i	 over 	 heard 	 	two	women	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	brother	of	one	woman	,	who	was	in	the	 single 	 s 	 	scene	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	woman	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	my	brother	is	 hav 	 ing 	 	trouble	 get 	 ting 	 	 date 	 s 	 	,	so	he	's	 try 	 ing 	 	speed	 d 	 ating 	 	.	``	i	do	n't	know	if	you	know	speed	 d 	 ating 	 	?
women	 s 	 it 	 	at	 table 	 s 	 	and	men	go	from	table	to	table	,
and	there	's	a	clock	and	a	bell	,	and	at	five	 minute 	 s 	 	,	 bing 	 o 	 	,	the	conversation	 end 	 s 	 	and	the	woman	can	decide	 whet 	 her 	 	to	give	her	card	or	her	email	address	to	the	man	for	follow	up	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	woman	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	my	brother	's	never	gotten	a	card	,	and	i	know	 exact 	 ly 	 	why	.
the	moment	he	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	down	,	he	 start 	 s 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	non	-	stop	about	 him 	 self 	 	;	he	never	 ask 	 s 	 	about	the	woman	.	``	and	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	some	research	in	the	sunday	 style 	 s 	 	section	of	the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	,	looking	at	the	back	 st 	 ories 	 	of	 marriage 	 s 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	--	and	i	came	to	the	marriage	of	alice	charney	epstein	.	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	that	when	she	was	in	the	 d 	 ating 	 	scene	,	she	had	a	simple	test	she	put	people	to	.	the	test	was	:	from	the	moment	they	got	together	,	how	long	it	would	take	the	guy	to	ask	her	a	question	with	the	word	``	you	``	in	it	.
and	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	epstein	 ac 	 ed 	 	the	test	,	 there 	 fore 	 	the	article	.	now	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	--	it	's	a	little	test	i	 encourag 	 e 	 	you	to	try	out	at	a	party	.
here	at	ted	there	are	great	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	.
the	harvard	business	review	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	had	an	article	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	human	moment	,	``	about	how	to	make	real	contact	with	a	person	at	work	.	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	well	,	the	fundamental	thing	you	have	to	do	is	turn	off	your	 black 	 berry 	 	,	close	your	 lap 	 top 	 	,	end	your	 day 	 dream 	 	and	pay	full	attention	to	the	person	.
there	is	a	 new 	 ly 	 	 co 	 in 	 ed 	 	word	in	the	english	language	for	the	moment	when	the	person	we	're	with	 whip 	 s 	 	out	 the 	 ir 	 	 black 	 berry 	 	or	 answer 	 s 	 	that	cell	phone	,	and	all	of	a	sudden	we	do	n't	exist	.
the	word	is	``	 pizzl 	 ed 	 	``	:	it	's	a	combination	of	 puzzl 	 ed 	 	and	 piss 	 ed 	 	off	.
i	think	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	apt	.	it	's	our	 empath 	 y 	 	,	it	's	our	 t 	 un 	 ing 	 	in	which	 separat 	 es 	 	us	from	machiavellians	or	 socio 	 path 	 s 	 	.
i	have	a	brother	-	in	-	law	who	's	an	expert	on	 horr 	 or 	 	and	terror	--	he	wrote	the	 annot 	 ated 	 	dracula	,	the	essential	frankenstein	--	he	was	trained	 a 	 s 	 	a	chaucer	scholar	,	but	he	was	born	in	transylvania	and	i	think	it	 affect 	 ed 	 	him	a	little	bit	.	at	any	rate	,	at	one	point	my	brother	-	in	-	law	,	leonard	,	 decide 	 d 	 	to	write	a	book	about	a	 s 	 erial 	 	killer	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	man	who	 terror 	 ized 	 	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 vic 	 in 	 ity 	 	we	're	in	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.	he	was	known	 a 	 s 	 	the	santa	cruz	 strangle 	 r 	 	.
and	before	he	was	 arrest 	 ed 	 	,	he	had	 murder 	 ed 	 	his	 grand 	 parent 	 s 	 	,	his	mother	and	five	co	-	eds	at	uc	santa	cruz	.
so	my	brother	-	in	-	law	 go 	 es 	 	to	interview	 th 	 is 	 	killer	and	he	 real 	 ize 	 s 	 	when	he	 meet 	 s 	 	him	that	 th 	 is 	 	guy	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 terrify 	 ing 	 	.
for	one	thing	,	he	's	 al 	 most 	 	seven	feet	tall	.	but	that	's	not	the	most	 terrify 	 ing 	 	thing	about	him	.
the	 scar 	 iest 	 	thing	is	that	his	iq	is	160	:	a	 cert 	 ified 	 	 gen 	 ius 	 	.
but	there	is	zero	correlation	between	iq	and	 emotion 	 al 	 	 empath 	 y 	 	,	 feel 	 ing 	 	with	the	other	person	.	they	're	controlled	by	different	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	brain	.
so	at	one	point	,	my	brother	-	in	-	law	 get 	 s 	 	up	the	courage	to	ask	the	one	question	he	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 s 	 	to	know	the	answer	to	,	and	that	is	:	how	could	you	have	 d 	 one 	 	it	?
did	n't	you	feel	any	 p 	 ity 	 	for	your	 victim 	 s 	 	?	these	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 intima 	 te 	 	 murder 	 s 	 	--	he	 strangle 	 d 	 	his	 victim 	 s 	 	.
and	the	 strangle 	 r 	 	 say 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	matter	-	of	-	 fact 	 ly 	 	,	``	oh	no	.	if	i	'd	felt	the	 di 	 stress 	 	,	i	could	not	have	 d 	 one 	 	it	.
i	had	to	turn	that	part	of	me	off	.	i	had	to	turn	that	part	of	me	off	.	``
and	i	think	that	that	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 trou 	 bling 	 	,
and	in	a	sense	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 reflect 	 ing 	 	on	 turn 	 ing 	 	that	part	of	us	off	.
when	we	focus	on	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	any	activity	,	we	do	turn	that	part	of	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	off	if	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	person	.
think	about	going	 shop 	 ping 	 	and	think	about	the	 possibil 	 ities 	 	of	a	 com 	 passionate 	 	 consumer 	 ism 	 	.
right	now	,	 a 	 s 	 	bill	mcdonough	 ha 	 s 	 	 point 	 ed 	 	out	,	the	 object 	 s 	 	that	we	buy	and	use	have	 hid 	 den 	 	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	.
we	're	all	 unwitt 	 ing 	 	 victim 	 s 	 	of	a	 collect 	 ive 	 	blind	spot	.
we	do	n't	notice	and	do	n't	notice	that	we	do	n't	notice	the	toxic	 molecule 	 s 	 	 emit 	 ted 	 	by	a	carpet	or	by	the	fabric	on	the	 seat 	 s 	 	.
or	we	do	n't	know	if	that	fabric	is	a	 techno 	 logical 	 	or	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	nutrient	;	it	can	be	 re 	 used 	 	or	 do 	 es 	 	it	just	end	up	at	 land 	 fill 	 	?	in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	we	're	 obliv 	 ious 	 	to	the	 eco 	 logical 	 	and	public	health	and	social	and	economic	justice	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	buy	and	use	.
in	a	sense	,	the	room	 it 	 self 	 	is	the	elephant	in	the	room	,	but	we	do	n't	see	it	.	and	we	've	 be 	 come 	 	 victim 	 s 	 	of	a	system	that	 point 	 s 	 	us	 else 	 where 	 	.	consider	 th 	 is 	 	.
there	's	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	book	 call 	 ed 	 	stuff	:	the	 hid 	 den 	 	life	of	 every 	 day 	 	 object 	 s 	 	.
and	it	 talk 	 s 	 	about	the	back	story	of	 some 	 thing 	 	like	a	t	-	shirt	.	and	it	 talk 	 s 	 	about	where	the	cotton	was	grown	and	the	 fertil 	 izer 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	used	and	the	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	for	 s 	 oil 	 	of	that	 fertil 	 izer 	 	.	and	it	 ment 	 ions 	 	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	that	cotton	is	 ver 	 y 	 	resistant	to	 text 	 ile 	 	dye	;	about	60	percent	 wash 	 es 	 	off	 in 	 to 	 	 waste 	 water 	 	.	and	it	's	well	known	by	 epidemio 	 logists 	 	that	 kid 	 s 	 	who	live	near	 text 	 ile 	 	 work 	 s 	 	tend	to	have	high	rates	of	leukemia	.
there	's	a	company	,	bennett	and	company	,	that	 suppli 	 es 	 	polo.com	,	victoria	's	secret	--	they	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	ceo	,	who	's	aware	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	in	 chin 	 a 	 	 form 	 ed 	 	a	joint	venture	with	 the 	 ir 	 	dye	 work 	 s 	 	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	the	 waste 	 water 	 	would	be	 proper 	 ly 	 	taken	care	of	before	it	 return 	 ed 	 	to	the	 ground 	 water 	 	.
right	now	,	we	do	n't	have	the	option	to	 choos 	 e 	 	the	virtuous	t	-	shirt	over	the	non	-	virtuous	one	.	so	what	would	it	take	to	do	that	?
well	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	.	for	one	thing	,	there	's	a	new	 electron 	 ic 	 	 tag 	 ging 	 	technology	that	 allow 	 s 	 	any	store	to	know	the	entire	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	any	item	on	the	 shelv 	 es 	 	in	that	store	.	you	can	track	it	back	to	the	 factor 	 y 	 	.	once	you	can	track	it	back	to	the	 factor 	 y 	 	,	you	can	look	at	the	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	 process 	 es 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	used	to	make	it	,	and	if	it	's	virtuous	,	you	can	label	it	that	way	.	or	if	it	's	not	so	virtuous	,	you	can	go	 in 	 to 	 	--	 to 	 day 	 	,	go	 in 	 to 	 	any	store	,	put	your	scanner	on	a	palm	onto	a	 bar 	 code 	 	,	which	will	take	you	to	a	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
they	have	it	for	people	with	 alle 	 rgie 	 s 	 	to	 peanut 	 s 	 	.
that	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	could	tell	you	 thing 	 s 	 	about	that	object	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	at	point	of	purchase	,	we	might	be	able	to	make	a	 com 	 passionate 	 	choice	.
there	's	a	 say 	 ing 	 	in	the	world	of	information	science	:	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	 every 	 body 	 	will	know	 every 	 thing 	 	.
and	the	question	is	:	will	it	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	?
some	time	ago	when	i	was	 work 	 ing 	 	for	the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	,	it	was	in	the	'80s	,	i	did	an	article	on	what	was	then	a	new	problem	in	new	york	--	it	was	 home 	 less 	 	people	on	the	 street 	 s 	 	.
and	i	 s 	 pent 	 	a	couple	of	 week 	 s 	 	going	around	with	a	social	work	 age 	 ncy 	 	that	 mini 	 ster 	 ed 	 	to	the	 home 	 less 	 	.	and	i	 real 	 ized 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	the	 home 	 less 	 	through	 the 	 ir 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	that	 al 	 most 	 	all	of	them	 we 	 re 	 	 psych 	 iatric 	 	 patient 	 s 	 	that	had	 no 	 where 	 	to	go	.	they	had	a	 diagnos 	 is 	 	.	it	made	me	--	what	it	did	was	to	shake	me	out	of	the	urban	trance	where	,	when	we	see	,	when	we	're	 pass 	 ing 	 	 some 	 one 	 	who	's	 home 	 less 	 	in	the	 per 	 iph 	 ery 	 	of	our	vision	,	it	 stay 	 s 	 	on	the	 per 	 iph 	 ery 	 	.
we	do	n't	notice	and	 there 	 fore 	 	we	do	n't	act	.
one	day	soon	after	that	--	it	was	a	friday	--	at	the	end	of	the	day	,	i	went	down	--	i	was	going	down	to	the	 sub 	 way 	 	.	it	was	rush	hour	and	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	 we 	 re 	 	 stream 	 ing 	 	down	the	 stair 	 s 	 	.
and	all	of	a	sudden	 a 	 s 	 	i	was	going	down	the	 stair 	 s 	 	i	 notice 	 d 	 	that	there	was	a	man	 s 	 lump 	 ed 	 	to	the	side	,	 shirt 	 less 	 	,	not	moving	,	and	people	 we 	 re 	 	just	 step 	 ping 	 	over	him	--	 hundred 	 s 	 	and	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	people	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	my	urban	trance	had	 be 	 en 	 	 some 	 how 	 	 weak 	 ened 	 	,	i	found	 my 	 self 	 	 stop 	 ping 	 	to	find	out	what	was	wrong	.
the	moment	i	 stop 	 ped 	 	,	half	a	dozen	other	people	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	 ring 	 ed 	 	the	same	guy	.
and	we	found	out	that	he	was	hispanic	,	he	did	n't	speak	any	english	,	he	had	no	money	,	he	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 wander 	 ing 	 	the	 street 	 s 	 	for	 day 	 s 	 	,	 starv 	 ing 	 	,	and	he	'd	 faint 	 ed 	 	from	 hung 	 er 	 	.
 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	 some 	 one 	 	went	to	get	 o 	 range 	 	juice	,	 some 	 one 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	a	 hot 	 dog 	 	,	 some 	 one 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	a	 sub 	 way 	 	cop	.
 th 	 is 	 	guy	was	back	on	his	feet	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	.
but	all	it	took	was	that	simple	act	of	 not 	 ic 	 ing 	 	,
and	so	i	'm	 optimist 	 ic 	 	.
