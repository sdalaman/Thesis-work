so	,	imagine	you	're	 stand 	 ing 	 	on	a	street	 any 	 where 	 	in	america	and	a	japanese	man	 come 	 s 	 	up	to	you	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	excuse	me	,	what	is	the	name	of	 th 	 is 	 	block	?	``
and	you	say	,	``	i	'm	sorry	,	well	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	oak	street	,	that	's	elm	street	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	26th	,	that	's	27th	.	``
he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	ok	,	but	what	is	the	name	of	that	block	?	``
you	say	,	``	well	,	 block 	 s 	 	do	n't	have	 name 	 s 	 	.
 street 	 s 	 	have	 name 	 s 	 	;	 block 	 s 	 	are	just	the	 un 	 named 	 	 space 	 s 	 	in	between	 street 	 s 	 	.	``
he	 leav 	 es 	 	,	a	little	 con 	 fused 	 	and	 disappoint 	 ed 	 	.
so	,	now	imagine	you	're	 stand 	 ing 	 	on	a	street	,	 any 	 where 	 	in	japan	,	you	turn	to	a	person	next	to	you	and	say	,	``	excuse	me	,	what	is	the	name	of	 th 	 is 	 	street	?	``
they	say	,	``	oh	,	well	that	's	block	17	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	block	16.	``
and	you	say	,	``	ok	,	but	what	is	the	name	of	 th 	 is 	 	street	?	``
and	they	say	,	``	well	,	 street 	 s 	 	do	n't	have	 name 	 s 	 	.
 block 	 s 	 	have	 name 	 s 	 	.
just	look	at	google	 map 	 s 	 	here	.	there	's	block	14	,	15	,	16	,	17	,	18	,	19	.
all	of	these	 block 	 s 	 	have	 name 	 s 	 	,
and	the	 street 	 s 	 	are	just	the	 un 	 named 	 	 space 	 s 	 	in	between	the	 block 	 s 	 	.
and	you	say	then	,	``	ok	,	then	how	do	you	know	your	home	address	?	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	easy	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 di 	 strict 	 	eight	.
there	's	block	17	,	house	number	one	.	``
you	say	,	``	ok	,	but	 walk 	 ing 	 	around	the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	,	i	 notice 	 d 	 	that	the	house	 number 	 s 	 	do	n't	go	in	order	.	``
he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	of	course	they	do	.	they	go	in	the	order	in	which	they	 we 	 re 	 	built	.
the	first	house	ever	built	on	a	block	is	house	number	one	.
the	second	house	ever	built	is	house	number	two	.
third	is	house	number	three	.	it	's	easy	.	it	's	obvious	.	``
so	,	i	love	that	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	we	need	to	go	to	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	side	of	the	world	to	 real 	 ize 	 	 assumption 	 s 	 	we	did	n't	even	know	we	had	,	and	 real 	 ize 	 	that	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	of	them	may	 al 	 so 	 	be	true	.
so	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	there	are	 doctor 	 s 	 	in	 chin 	 a 	 	who	 believ 	 e 	 	that	it	's	 the 	 ir 	 	job	to	keep	you	 health 	 y 	 	.
so	,	any	month	you	are	 health 	 y 	 	you	pay	them	,	and	when	you	're	sick	you	do	n't	have	to	pay	them	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 fail 	 ed 	 	at	 the 	 ir 	 	job	.	they	get	rich	when	you	're	 health 	 y 	 	,	not	sick	.
in	most	music	,	we	think	of	the	``	one	``	 a 	 s 	 	the	 down 	 beat 	 	,	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	musical	phrase	:	one	,	two	,	three	,	four	.
but	in	west	african	music	,	the	``	one	``	is	thought	of	 a 	 s 	 	the	end	of	the	phrase	,	like	the	period	at	the	end	of	a	sentence	.
so	,	you	can	hear	it	not	just	in	the	 phras 	 ing 	 	,	but	the	way	they	count	off	 the 	 ir 	 	music	:
two	,	three	,	four	,	one	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	map	is	 al 	 so 	 	accurate	.
there	's	a	 say 	 ing 	 	that	 what 	 ever 	 	true	thing	you	can	say	about	india	,	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	true	.
so	,	let	's	never	forget	,	 whet 	 her 	 	at	ted	,	or	 any 	 where 	 	else	,	that	 what 	 ever 	 	 brilli 	 ant 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	you	have	or	hear	,	that	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	may	 al 	 so 	 	be	true	.
