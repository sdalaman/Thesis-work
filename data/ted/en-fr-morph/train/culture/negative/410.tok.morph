you	know	,	we	're	going	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	a	little	 different 	 ly 	 	.
i	'm	not	going	to	show	you	a	 present 	 ation 	 	.	i	'm	going	to	talk	to	you	.
and	at	the	same	time	,	we	're	going	to	look	at	just	 image 	 s 	 	from	a	photo	stream	that	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	close	to	live	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	--	 snap 	 shot 	 s 	 	from	second	life	.	so	 hope 	 fully 	 	 th 	 is 	 	will	be	 fasci 	 nating 	 	.
you	can	--	i	can	compete	for	your	attention	with	the	strange	 picture 	 s 	 	that	you	see	on	screen	that	come	from	there	.
i	thought	i	'd	talk	a	little	bit	about	some	just	big	 idea 	 s 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	then	get	john	back	out	here	so	we	can	talk	 interact 	 ively 	 	a	little	bit	more	and	think	and	ask	 question 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	i	guess	the	first	question	is	,	why	build	a	virtual	world	at	all	?
and	i	think	the	answer	to	that	is	 al 	 ways 	 	going	to	be	at	 l 	 east 	 	driven	to	a	certain	 ex 	 tent 	 	by	the	people	 initi 	 ally 	 	crazy	 en 	 ough 	 	to	start	the	project	,	you	know	.
so	i	can	give	you	a	little	bit	of	first	 back 	 ground 	 	just	on	me	and	what	 move 	 d 	 	me	 a 	 s 	 	a	--	 re 	 ally 	 	going	back	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	a	teenager	and	then	an	adult	,	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	try	and	build	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	thing	.
i	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	creative	kid	who	read	a	lot	,	and	got	 in 	 to 	 	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	first	,	and	then	 lat 	 er 	 	,	 programm 	 ing 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	,	when	i	was	 re 	 ally 	 	young	.
i	was	just	 al 	 ways 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	 thing 	 s 	 	.
i	was	just	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	taking	 thing 	 s 	 	 a 	 part 	 	and	building	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	just	 any 	 thing 	 	i	could	do	with	my	 hand 	 s 	 	or	with	wood	or	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	or	metal	or	 any 	 thing 	 	else	.
and	so	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	--	and	it	's	a	great	second	life	thing	--	i	had	a	 bed 	 room 	 	.
and	every	kid	,	you	know	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	teenager	,	 ha 	 s 	 	got	his	 bed 	 room 	 	he	 re 	 treat 	 s 	 	to	--	but	i	 want 	 ed 	 	my	door	,	i	thought	it	would	be	cool	if	my	door	went	up	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 open 	 ed 	 	,	like	on	star	trek	.
i	thought	it	would	be	neat	to	do	that	.	and	so	i	got	up	in	the	 ceil 	 ing 	 	and	i	cut	through	the	 ceil 	 ing 	 	joists	,	much	to	my	 parent 	 s 	 	'	 de 	 light 	 	,	and	put	the	door	,	you	know	,	 be 	 ing 	 	 pull 	 ed 	 	up	through	the	 ceil 	 ing 	 	.
i	built	--	i	put	a	 gar 	 age 	 	-	door	 open 	 er 	 	up	in	the	 at 	 tic 	 	that	would	pull	 th 	 is 	 	door	up	.
you	can	imagine	the	amount	of	time	that	it	took	me	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	to	the	house	and	the	 dis 	 pleasure 	 	of	my	 parent 	 s 	 	.
the	thing	that	was	 al 	 ways 	 	 s 	 tri 	 king 	 	to	me	was	that	we	 a 	 s 	 	people	could	have	so	 man 	 y 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	about	 thing 	 s 	 	we	'd	like	to	do	,	but	are	so	often	 un 	 able 	 	,	in	the	real	world	,	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	--	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	cobble	together	the	 material 	 s 	 	and	go	through	the	actual	 exec 	 ution 	 	phase	of	building	 some 	 thing 	 	that	you	imagine	from	a	design	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	.
and	so	for	me	,	i	know	that	when	the	 inter 	 net 	 	came	around	and	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	computer	 programm 	 ing 	 	and	just	,	you	know	,	just	 general 	 ly 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	run	my	own	little	company	and	figure	out	what	to	do	with	the	 inter 	 net 	 	and	with	 computer 	 s 	 	,	i	was	just	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	 s 	 truck 	 	by	how	the	ultimate	thing	that	you	would	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	do	with	the	 inter 	 net 	 	and	with	 computer 	 s 	 	would	be	to	use	the	 inter 	 net 	 	and	 connect 	 ed 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	to	 simul 	 ate 	 	a	world	to	sort	of	 re 	 create 	 	the	 law 	 s 	 	of	physics	and	the	 rule 	 s 	 	of	how	 thing 	 s 	 	went	together	--	the	sort	of	--	the	idea	of	 atom 	 s 	 	and	how	to	make	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	do	that	 in 	 side 	 	a	computer	so	that	we	could	all	get	in	there	and	make	stuff	.
and	so	for	me	that	was	the	thing	that	was	so	 ent 	 ic 	 ing 	 	.
i	just	 want 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	place	where	you	could	build	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	so	i	think	you	see	that	in	the	genesis	of	what	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	with	second	life	,	and	i	think	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	.
i	 al 	 so 	 	think	that	more	 general 	 ly 	 	,	the	use	of	the	 inter 	 net 	 	and	technology	 a 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	a	space	between	us	for	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	and	design	is	a	general	trend	.
it	is	a	--	sort	of	a	great	human	progress	.
technology	is	just	 general 	 ly 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	used	to	allow	us	to	create	in	 a 	 s 	 	 share 	 d 	 	and	social	a	way	 a 	 s 	 	possible	.
and	i	think	that	second	life	and	virtual	 world 	 s 	 	more	 general 	 ly 	 	represent	the	best	we	can	do	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	that	right	now	.
you	know	,	 an 	 other 	 	way	to	look	at	that	,	and	related	to	the	content	and	,	you	know	,	 think 	 ing 	 	about	space	,	is	to	connect	sort	of	virtual	 world 	 s 	 	to	space	.
i	thought	that	might	be	a	 f 	 un 	 	thing	to	talk	about	for	a	second	.
if	you	think	about	going	 in 	 to 	 	space	,	it	's	a	 fasci 	 nating 	 	thing	.
so	 man 	 y 	 	 movie 	 s 	 	,	so	 man 	 y 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	,	we	all	sort	of	dream	about	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	space	.	now	,	why	is	that	?
stop	for	a	moment	and	ask	,	why	that	 conce 	 it 	 	?
why	do	we	 a 	 s 	 	people	want	to	do	that	?
i	think	there	's	a	couple	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.	it	's	what	we	see	in	the	 movie 	 s 	 	--	you	know	,	it	's	 th 	 is 	 	dream	that	we	all	share	.
one	is	that	if	you	went	 in 	 to 	 	space	you	'd	be	able	to	begin	 aga 	 in 	 	.
in	some	sense	,	you	would	 be 	 come 	 	 some 	 one 	 	else	in	that	journey	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	would	n't	be	--	you	'd	 leav 	 e 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	and	life	 a 	 s 	 	you	know	it	,	 be 	 hind 	 	.
and	so	 inevit 	 ably 	 	,	you	would	transform	 your 	 self 	 	--	 ir 	 revers 	 ibly 	 	,	in	all	 like 	 li 	 hood 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	you	 beg 	 an 	 	 th 	 is 	 	exploration	.
and	then	the	second	thing	is	that	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	tangible	sense	that	if	you	travel	far	 en 	 ough 	 	,	you	can	find	out	there	--	oh	,	 yea 	 h 	 	--	you	have	no	idea	what	you	're	going	to	find	once	you	get	there	,	 in 	 to 	 	space	.
it	's	going	to	be	different	than	here	.
and	in	fact	,	it	's	going	to	be	so	different	than	what	we	see	here	on	earth	that	 any 	 thing 	 	is	going	to	be	possible	.
so	that	's	kind	of	the	idea	--	we	 a 	 s 	 	 human 	 s 	 	 crav 	 e 	 	the	idea	of	creating	a	new	 ident 	 ity 	 	and	going	 in 	 to 	 	a	place	where	 any 	 thing 	 	is	possible	.
and	i	think	that	if	you	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 it 	 	and	think	about	it	,	virtual	 world 	 s 	 	,	and	where	we	're	going	with	more	and	more	computing	technology	,	represent	 essential 	 ly 	 	the	 like 	 ly 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	tactically	possible	version	of	space	exploration	.
we	are	 move 	 d 	 	by	the	idea	of	virtual	 world 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	,	like	space	,	they	allow	us	to	 re 	 invent 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	they	contain	 any 	 thing 	 	and	 every 	 thing 	 	,	and	 prob 	 ably 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	could	happen	there	.
you	know	,	to	give	you	a	 s 	 ize 	 	idea	about	scale	,	you	know	,	 compar 	 ing 	 	space	to	second	life	,	most	people	do	n't	 real 	 ize 	 	,	kind	of	--	and	then	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	like	the	 inter 	 net 	 	in	the	early	'90s	.
in	fact	,	second	life	virtual	 world 	 s 	 	are	a	lot	like	the	 inter 	 net 	 	in	the	early	'90s	 to 	 day 	 	:	 every 	 body 	 	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	,	there	's	a	lot	of	hype	and	 excit 	 ement 	 	about	one	idea	or	the	next	from	moment	to	moment	,	and	then	there	's	despair	and	 every 	 body 	 	 think 	 s 	 	the	whole	thing	's	not	going	to	work	.
 every 	 thing 	 	that	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	with	second	life	and	more	 broad 	 ly 	 	with	virtual	 world 	 s 	 	,	all	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	early	'90s	.
we	 al 	 ways 	 	play	a	game	at	the	 off 	 ice 	 	where	you	can	take	any	article	and	find	the	same	article	where	you	just	replace	the	 word 	 s 	 	``	second	life	``	with	``	web	,	``	and	``	virtual	 re 	 ality 	 	``	with	``	 inter 	 net 	 	.	``
you	can	find	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	 article 	 s 	 	written	about	 every 	 thing 	 	that	people	are	 observ 	 ing 	 	.
to	give	you	an	idea	of	scale	,	second	life	is	about	20,000	cpus	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	.
it	's	about	20,000	 computer 	 s 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	together	in	three	 facil 	 ities 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	right	now	,	that	are	 simul 	 ating 	 	 th 	 is 	 	virtual	space	.	and	the	virtual	space	 it 	 self 	 	--	there	's	about	250,000	people	a	day	that	are	 wander 	 ing 	 	around	in	there	,	so	the	kind	of	,	active	population	is	 some 	 thing 	 	like	a	smallish	city	.
the	space	 it 	 self 	 	is	about	10	 time 	 s 	 	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	san	francisco	,	and	it	's	about	 a 	 s 	 	 dense 	 ly 	 	built	out	.
so	it	 give 	 s 	 	you	an	idea	of	scale	.	now	,	it	's	 expand 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	--	about	five	percent	a	month	or	so	right	now	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	new	 serv 	 ers 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 add 	 ed 	 	.
and	so	of	course	,	 radical 	 ly 	 	 un 	 like 	 	the	real	world	,	and	like	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	the	whole	thing	is	 expand 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	and	 historic 	 ally 	 	 exponential 	 ly 	 	.
so	that	sort	of	space	exploration	thing	is	 match 	 ed 	 	up	here	by	the	amount	of	content	that	's	in	there	,	and	i	think	that	amount	is	critical	.
it	was	critical	with	the	virtual	world	that	it	be	 th 	 is 	 	space	of	 tru 	 ly 	 	infinite	 possibil 	 ity 	 	.
we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	sensitive	to	that	 a 	 s 	 	 human 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	you	know	when	you	see	it	.	you	know	when	you	can	do	 any 	 thing 	 	in	a	space	and	you	know	when	you	ca	n't	.
second	life	 to 	 day 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	20,000	 machine 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	about	100	million	or	so	user	-	 create 	 d 	 	 object 	 s 	 	where	,	you	know	,	an	object	would	be	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	possibly	 inter 	 active 	 	.
 ten 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	them	are	 think 	 ing 	 	all	the	time	;	they	have	code	 attach 	 ed 	 	to	them	.
so	it	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	large	world	 al 	 ready 	 	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	amount	of	stuff	that	's	there	and	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
if	 any 	 body 	 	 play 	 s 	 	,	like	,	world	of	warcraft	,	world	of	warcraft	 come 	 s 	 	on	,	like	,	four	dvds	.
second	life	,	by	 compar 	 ison 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	about	100	 tera 	 byte 	 s 	 	of	user	-	 create 	 d 	 	data	,	making	it	about	25,000	 time 	 s 	 	 large 	 r 	 	.
so	 aga 	 in 	 	,	like	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	aol	,	and	the	sort	of	chat	rooms	and	content	on	aol	at	the	time	,	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	here	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	different	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 she 	 er 	 	scale	of	what	people	can	do	when	they	're	enabled	to	do	 any 	 thing 	 	they	want	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
the	last	big	thought	is	that	it	is	 al 	 most 	 	 certain 	 ly 	 	true	that	 what 	 ever 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	evolve	 in 	 to 	 	is	going	to	be	 big 	 ger 	 	in	total	 us 	 age 	 	than	the	web	 it 	 self 	 	.
and	let	me	 just 	 ify 	 	that	with	two	 state 	 ments 	 	.
 generic 	 ally 	 	,	what	we	use	the	web	for	is	to	organize	,	 ex 	 change 	 	,	create	and	 consum 	 e 	 	information	.
it	's	kind	of	like	irene	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	google	 be 	 ing 	 	data	-	driven	.
i	'd	say	i	kind	of	think	about	the	world	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	information	.
 every 	 thing 	 	that	we	interact	with	,	all	the	 experience 	 s 	 	that	we	have	,	is	kind	of	us	 flow 	 ing 	 	through	a	sea	of	information	and	 interact 	 ing 	 	with	it	in	different	ways	.
the	web	 put 	 s 	 	information	in	the	form	of	text	and	 image 	 s 	 	.
the	 top 	 ology 	 	,	the	 geo 	 graphy 	 	of	the	web	is	text	-	to	-	text	 link 	 s 	 	for	the	most	part	.
that	's	one	way	of	 organ 	 izing 	 	information	,	but	there	are	two	 thing 	 s 	 	about	the	way	you	access	information	in	a	virtual	world	that	i	think	are	the	 import 	 ant 	 	ways	that	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	different	and	much	better	than	what	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	do	to	date	with	the	web	.
the	first	is	that	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	the	--	well	,	the	first	 differ 	 ence 	 	for	virtual	 world 	 s 	 	is	that	information	is	 present 	 ed 	 	to	you	in	the	virtual	world	using	the	most	 power 	 ful 	 	 icon 	 ic 	 	 symbol 	 s 	 	that	you	can	possibly	use	with	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
so	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	c	-	h	-	a	-	i	-	r	is	the	english	word	for	that	,	but	a	picture	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	universal	symbol	.
 every 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	.	there	's	no	need	to	 transl 	 ate 	 	it	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	more	 memor 	 able 	 	if	i	show	you	that	picture	,	and	i	show	you	c	-	h	-	a	-	i	-	r	on	a	piece	of	paper	.
you	can	do	 test 	 s 	 	that	show	that	you	'll	remember	that	i	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	a	chair	a	couple	of	 day 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	a	lot	better	.
so	when	you	organize	information	using	the	 symbol 	 s 	 	of	our	 memor 	 y 	 	,	using	the	most	common	 symbol 	 s 	 	that	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 immers 	 ed 	 	in	all	our	 live 	 s 	 	,	you	maximally	both	 excit 	 e 	 	,	 stimul 	 ate 	 	,	are	able	to	remember	,	transfer	and	 manipul 	 ate 	 	data	.
and	so	virtual	 world 	 s 	 	are	the	best	way	for	us	to	 essential 	 ly 	 	organize	and	experience	information	.
and	i	think	that	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	people	have	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	for	20	 year 	 s 	 	--	you	know	,	that	3d	,	that	 life 	 like 	 	 environment 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	in	some	 magic 	 al 	 	way	to	us	.
but	the	second	thing	--	and	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	one	is	less	obvious	--	is	that	the	experience	of	creating	,	 consum 	 ing 	 	,	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	that	information	is	in	the	virtual	world	 im 	 plicit 	 ly 	 	and	 inherent 	 ly 	 	social	.
you	are	 al 	 ways 	 	there	with	other	people	.
and	we	 a 	 s 	 	 human 	 s 	 	are	social	 creature 	 s 	 	and	must	,	or	are	aided	by	,	or	enjoy	more	,	the	consumption	of	information	in	the	presence	of	 other 	 s 	 	.
it	's	essential	to	us	.	you	ca	n't	 es 	 cape 	 	it	.
when	you	're	on	amazon.com	and	you	're	looking	for	digital	 camera 	 s 	 	or	 what 	 ever 	 	,	you	're	on	there	right	now	,	when	you	're	on	the	 s 	 ite 	 	,	with	like	5,000	other	people	,	but	you	ca	n't	talk	to	them	.
you	ca	n't	just	turn	to	the	people	that	are	 brow 	 s 	 ing 	 	digital	 camera 	 s 	 	on	the	same	page	 a 	 s 	 	you	,	and	ask	them	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	have	you	 s 	 een 	 	one	of	these	before	?	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 buy 	 ing 	 	it	.	``
that	experience	of	like	,	 shop 	 ping 	 	together	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	a	simple	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	is	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	how	 a 	 s 	 	social	 creature 	 s 	 	we	want	to	experience	information	in	that	way	.
so	that	second	point	,	that	we	 inherent 	 ly 	 	experience	information	together	or	want	to	experience	it	together	,	is	critical	to	 essential 	 ly 	 	,	kind	of	,	 th 	 is 	 	trend	of	where	we	're	going	to	use	technology	to	connect	us	.
and	so	i	think	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	that	it	's	 like 	 ly 	 	that	in	the	next	decade	or	so	these	virtual	 world 	 s 	 	are	going	to	be	the	most	common	way	 a 	 s 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	that	we	kind	of	use	the	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	of	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	if	you	will	,	to	be	together	,	to	 consum 	 e 	 	information	.
you	know	,	mapping	in	india	--	that	's	 s 	 uch 	 	a	great	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	the	solution	there	 involve 	 s 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	other	people	in	real	time	.
 ask 	 ing 	 	for	 ad 	 vice 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	any	possible	way	that	you	could	just	statically	organize	a	map	.
so	i	think	that	's	 an 	 other 	 	big	point	.
i	think	that	 where 	 ver 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	going	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	second	life	or	 it 	 s 	 	 descend 	 ants 	 	,	or	 some 	 thing 	 	 broad 	 er 	 	that	 happen 	 s 	 	all	around	the	world	at	a	lot	of	different	 point 	 s 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	're	going	to	see	the	 inter 	 net 	 	used	for	,	and	total	traffic	and	total	 un 	 ique 	 	 user 	 s 	 	is	going	to	 in 	 vert 	 	,	so	that	the	web	and	 it 	 s 	 	bibliographic	set	of	text	and	graphical	information	is	going	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	tool	or	a	part	of	that	consumption	pattern	,	but	the	pattern	 it 	 self 	 	is	going	to	happen	 most 	 ly 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	type	of	an	environment	.
big	idea	,	but	i	think	 high 	 ly 	 	 def 	 en 	 s 	 ible 	 	.
so	let	me	stop	there	and	 br 	 ing 	 	john	back	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	we	can	just	have	a	 long 	 er 	 	conversation	.
thank	you	.	john	.	that	's	great	.
john	hockenberry	:	why	is	the	creation	,	the	impulse	to	create	second	life	,
not	a	 utopia 	 n 	 	impulse	?
like	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	in	the	19th	century	,	any	number	of	 work 	 s 	 	of	 liter 	 ature 	 	that	 imagin 	 ed 	 	 alter 	 native 	 	 world 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 ex 	 plicit 	 ly 	 	 utopia 	 n 	 	.
philip	rosedale	:	i	think	that	's	great	.	that	's	 s 	 uch 	 	a	deep	question	.	 yea 	 h 	 	.
is	a	virtual	world	 like 	 ly 	 	to	be	a	utopia	,	would	be	one	way	i	'd	say	it	.
the	answer	is	no	,	and	i	think	the	reason	why	is	 be 	 cause 	 	the	web	 it 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	good	 ex 	 ample 	 	is	 pro 	 found 	 ly 	 	 bottom 	 s 	 	-	up	.
that	idea	of	infinite	 possibil 	 ity 	 	,	that	magic	of	 any 	 thing 	 	can	happen	,	 on 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	in	an	environment	where	you	 re 	 ally 	 	know	that	there	's	a	fundamental	 free 	 dom 	 	at	the	level	of	the	individual	 a 	 ctor 	 	,	at	the	level	of	the	lego	 block 	 s 	 	,	if	you	will	,	that	make	up	the	virtual	world	.
you	have	to	have	that	level	of	 free 	 dom 	 	,	and	so	i	'm	often	 ask 	 ed 	 	that	,	you	know	,	is	there	a	,	kind	of	,	 utopia 	 n 	 	or	,	is	there	a	 utopia 	 n 	 	 tend 	 ency 	 	to	second	life	and	 thing 	 s 	 	like	it	,	that	you	would	create	a	world	that	 ha 	 s 	 	a	grand	scheme	to	it	?
 t 	 hose 	 	top	-	down	 scheme 	 s 	 	are	 alien 	 ating 	 	to	just	about	 every 	 body 	 	,	even	if	you	mean	well	when	you	build	them	.
and	what	's	more	,	human	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	when	it	's	controlled	,	when	you	set	out	a	grand	scheme	of	 rule 	 s 	 	,	a	new	way	of	people	 interact 	 ing 	 	,	or	a	new	way	of	 lay 	 ing 	 	out	a	city	,	or	 what 	 ever 	 	,	that	stuff	 historic 	 ally 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	never	 scale 	 d 	 	much	beyond	,	you	know	--	i	 al 	 ways 	 	laughingly	say	--	the	mall	of	america	,	you	know	,	which	is	like	,	the	largest	piece	of	 central 	 ly 	 	designed	 architect 	 ure 	 	that	,	you	know	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	built	.
jh	:	the	kremlin	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	big	.
pr	:	the	kremlin	,	 yea 	 h 	 	.	that	's	true	.	the	whole	complex	.
jh	:	give	me	a	story	of	a	tool	you	 create 	 d 	 	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	in	second	life	that	you	 we 	 re 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	people	would	want	to	use	in	the	creation	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 avatar 	 s 	 	or	in	 commun 	 ic 	 ating 	 	that	people	 actual 	 ly 	 	in	practice	 s 	 aid 	 	,	no	,	i	'm	not	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	that	at	all	,	and	name	 some 	 thing 	 	that	you	did	n't	come	up	with	that	 al 	 most 	 	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	people	 beg 	 an 	 	to	demand	.
pr	:	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	i	can	think	of	 multi 	 ple 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	both	of	 t 	 hose 	 	.
one	of	my	 favor 	 ites 	 	.	i	had	 th 	 is 	 	feature	that	i	built	 in 	 to 	 	second	life	--	i	was	 re 	 ally 	 	passionate	about	it	.
it	was	an	ability	to	kind	of	walk	up	close	to	 some 	 body 	 	and	have	a	more	private	conversation	,	but	it	was	n't	instant	 mess 	 aging 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	you	had	to	sort	of	befriend	 some 	 body 	 	.
it	was	just	 th 	 is 	 	idea	that	you	could	kind	of	have	a	private	chat	.
i	just	remember	it	was	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	data	-	driven	design	.
i	thought	it	was	 s 	 uch 	 	a	good	idea	from	my	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	and	it	was	just	 absolute 	 ly 	 	never	used	,	and	we	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	--	i	think	we	've	now	 turn 	 ed 	 	it	off	,	if	i	remember	.
we	 final 	 ly 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	up	,	took	it	out	of	the	code	.
but	more	 general 	 ly 	 	,	you	know	,	one	other	 ex 	 ample 	 	i	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	which	is	great	 relat 	 ive 	 	to	the	 utopia 	 n 	 	idea	.
second	life	 original 	 ly 	 	had	16	 simul 	 ators 	 	.	it	now	 ha 	 s 	 	20,000	.
so	when	it	 on 	 ly 	 	had	16	,	it	was	 on 	 ly 	 	about	 a 	 s 	 	big	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	college	campus	.
and	we	had	--	we	zoned	it	,	you	know	:	we	put	a	 night 	 club 	 	,	we	put	a	 dis 	 co 	 	where	you	could	dance	,	and	then	we	had	a	place	where	you	could	fight	with	 gun 	 s 	 	if	you	 want 	 ed 	 	to	,	and	we	had	 an 	 other 	 	place	that	was	like	a	 board 	 walk 	 	,	kind	of	a	coney	 is 	 land 	 	.
and	we	laid	out	the	 zon 	 ing 	 	,	but	of	course	,	people	could	build	all	around	it	 how 	 ever 	 	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	.
and	what	was	so	 amaz 	 ing 	 	right	from	the	start	was	that	the	idea	that	we	had	put	out	in	the	 zon 	 ing 	 	 con 	 cept 	 	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	was	 instant 	 ly 	 	and	 thorough 	 ly 	 	 ignor 	 ed 	 	,	and	like	,	two	 month 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	whole	thing	,	--	which	is	 re 	 ally 	 	a	small	amount	of	time	,	even	in	second	life	time	--	i	remember	the	 user 	 s 	 	,	the	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	then	using	second	life	,	the	 resident 	 s 	 	came	to	me	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	we	want	to	buy	the	 dis 	 co 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	i	had	built	it	--	we	want	to	buy	that	land	and	raze	it	and	put	 house 	 s 	 	on	it	.	and	i	 s 	 old 	 	it	to	them	--
i	mean	,	we	 transfer 	 red 	 	 owner 	 ship 	 	and	they	had	a	big	party	and	 ble 	 w 	 	up	the	entire	building	.
and	i	remember	that	that	was	just	so	 tell 	 ing 	 	,	you	know	,	that	you	did	n't	know	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	was	going	to	happen	.
when	you	think	about	stuff	that	people	have	built	that	's	popular	--	jh	:	cbgb	's	 ha 	 s 	 	to	close	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	you	know	.	that	's	the	rule	.
pr	:	 exact 	 ly 	 	.	and	it	--	but	it	closed	on	day	one	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	in	 inter 	 net 	 	time	.
you	know	,	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 some 	 thing 	 	--	 pregn 	 ancy 	 	.
you	can	have	a	baby	in	second	life	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 d 	 one 	 	 entire 	 ly 	 	using	,	kind	of	,	the	 tool 	 s 	 	that	are	built	 in 	 to 	 	second	life	,	so	the	innate	 con 	 cept 	 	of	 be 	 coming 	 	 pregn 	 ant 	 	and	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	baby	,	of	course	--	second	life	is	,	at	the	platform	level	,	at	the	level	of	the	company	--	at	linden	lab	--	second	life	 ha 	 s 	 	no	game	 proper 	 ties 	 	to	it	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	.
there	is	no	attempt	to	structure	the	experience	,	to	make	it	 utopia 	 n 	 	in	that	sense	that	we	put	 in 	 to 	 	it	.
so	of	course	,	we	never	would	have	put	a	 mechan 	 ism 	 	for	 hav 	 ing 	 	 bab 	 ies 	 	or	,	you	know	,	taking	two	 avatar 	 s 	 	and	 mer 	 ging 	 	them	,	or	 some 	 thing 	 	.
but	people	built	the	ability	to	have	 bab 	 ies 	 	and	care	for	 bab 	 ies 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	purchasable	experience	that	you	can	have	in	second	life	and	so	--	i	mean	,	that	's	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	 fasci 	 nating 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	,	you	know	,	what	 go 	 es 	 	on	in	the	 over 	 all 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
and	of	course	,	the	 exist 	 ence 	 	of	an	 eco 	 nomy 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	idea	.
i	did	n't	talk	about	it	,	but	it	's	a	critical	feature	.
when	people	are	 give 	 n 	 	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	create	in	the	world	,	there	's	 re 	 ally 	 	two	 thing 	 s 	 	they	want	.
one	is	fair	 owner 	 ship 	 	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	they	create	.	and	then	the	second	one	is	--	if	they	feel	like	it	,	and	they	're	not	going	to	do	it	in	every	case	,	but	in	 man 	 y 	 	they	are	--	they	want	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	able	to	sell	that	creation	 a 	 s 	 	a	way	of	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	own	livelihood	.
true	on	the	web	--	 al 	 so 	 	true	in	second	life	.
and	so	the	 exist 	 ence 	 	of	an	 eco 	 nomy 	 	is	critical	.
jh	:	 question 	 s 	 	for	philip	rosedale	?	right	here	.
jh	:	the	 observ 	 ation 	 	is	,	philip	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 accus 	 ed 	 	of	looking	like	a	character	,	an	avatar	,	in	second	life	.
respond	,	and	then	we	'll	get	the	rest	of	your	question	.
pr	:	but	i	do	n't	look	like	my	avatar	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	people	here	know	what	my	avatar	 look 	 s 	 	like	?
that	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	not	 ver 	 y 	 	 man 	 y 	 	.
jh	:	are	you	 rip 	 ping 	 	off	 some 	 body 	 	else	's	avatar	with	that	,	sort	of	--	pr	:	no	,	no	.	i	did	n't	.	one	of	the	other	 guy 	 s 	 	at	work	had	a	fantastic	avatar	--	a	female	avatar	--	that	i	used	to	be	once	in	a	while	.
but	my	avatar	is	a	guy	 wear 	 ing 	 	chaps	.
 spi 	 ky 	 	hair	--	spikier	than	 th 	 is 	 	.	kind	of	 o 	 range 	 	hair	.
 handle 	 bar 	 	 must 	 ache 	 	.	kind	of	a	village	people	sort	of	a	character	.
so	,	 ver 	 y 	 	cool	.
jh	:	and	your	question	?
jh	:	the	question	is	,	there	 appear 	 s 	 	to	be	a	lack	of	cultural	fine	-	 t 	 un 	 ing 	 	in	second	life	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	seem	to	have	 it 	 s 	 	own	culture	,	and	the	sort	of	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	that	exist	in	the	real	world	are	n't	 transl 	 ated 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	second	life	map	.
pr	:	well	,	first	of	all	,	we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	early	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	going	on	for	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	so	part	of	what	we	see	is	the	same	evolution	of	human	behavior	that	you	see	in	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	.
so	a	fair	 critic 	 ism 	 	--	is	what	it	is	--	of	second	life	 to 	 day 	 	is	that	it	's	more	like	the	wild	west	than	it	is	like	rome	,	from	a	cultural	 stand 	 point 	 	.
that	 s 	 aid 	 	,	the	evolution	of	,	and	the	 nuance 	 d 	 	 interact 	 ion 	 	that	 create 	 s 	 	culture	,	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	at	10	 time 	 s 	 	the	speed	of	the	real	world	,	and	in	an	environment	where	,	if	you	walk	 in 	 to 	 	a	bar	in	second	life	,	65	percent	of	the	people	there	are	not	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	and	in	fact	are	 s 	 peaking 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	,	you	know	,	 vari 	 ous 	 	and	different	 language 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	one	of	the	ways	to	make	money	in	second	life	is	to	make	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	 transl 	 ators 	 	that	you	drag	onto	your	body	and	they	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	kind	of	,	pop	up	on	your	screen	and	allow	you	to	use	google	or	babel	fish	or	one	of	the	other	 on 	 line 	 	text	 transl 	 ators 	 	to	on	-	the	-	fly	 transl 	 ate 	 	spoken	--	i	'm	sorry	--	 type 	 d 	 	text	between	 individual 	 s 	 	.
and	so	,	the	 multi 	 cultural 	 	nature	and	the	sort	of	cultural	 melt 	 ing 	 	pot	that	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	 in 	 side 	 	second	life	is	 quit 	 e 	 	--	i	think	,	 quit 	 e 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	 relat 	 ive 	 	to	what	in	real	human	 term 	 s 	 	in	the	real	world	we	've	ever	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	.
so	,	i	think	that	culture	will	fine	-	tune	,	it	will	emerge	,	but	we	still	have	some	 year 	 s 	 	to	wait	while	that	 happen 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	would	 natural 	 ly 	 	expect	.
jh	:	other	 question 	 s 	 	?	right	here	.
jh	:	what	's	your	 demo 	 graphic 	 	?
pr	:	so	,	the	question	is	,	what	's	the	 demo 	 graphic 	 	.
so	,	the	average	age	of	a	person	in	second	life	is	32	,	 how 	 ever 	 	,	the	use	of	second	life	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	 dramat 	 ically 	 	 a 	 s 	 	your	physical	age	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	.	so	 a 	 s 	 	you	go	from	age	30	to	age	60	--	and	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	people	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 six 	 ties 	 	using	second	life	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	not	a	sharp	 curv 	 e 	 	--	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 distribut 	 ed 	 	--	 us 	 age 	 	 go 	 es 	 	up	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	,	like	,	 hour 	 s 	 	per	week	by	40	percent	 a 	 s 	 	you	go	from	age	30	to	age	60	in	real	life	,	so	there	's	not	--	 man 	 y 	 	people	make	the	 mistak 	 e 	 	of	 believ 	 ing 	 	that	second	life	is	some	kind	of	an	 on 	 line 	 	game	.	 actual 	 ly 	 	it	's	 general 	 ly 	 	unappealing	--	i	'm	just	 s 	 peaking 	 	 broad 	 ly 	 	and	 critical 	 ly 	 	--	it	's	not	 ver 	 y 	 	 appeal 	 ing 	 	to	people	that	play	 on 	 line 	 	video	 game 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 graphic 	 s 	 	are	not	yet	 equi 	 valent 	 	to	--	i	mean	,	these	are	 ver 	 y 	 	nice	 picture 	 s 	 	,	but	in	general	the	 graphic 	 s 	 	are	not	 quit 	 e 	 	 equi 	 valent 	 	to	the	fine	-	tuned	 graphic 	 s 	 	that	you	see	in	a	grand	 t 	 heft 	 	auto	4	.
so	average	age	:	32.	i	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 
65	percent	of	the	 user 	 s 	 	are	not	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
the	 distribut 	 ion 	 	 among 	 st 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	is	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	broad	.
there	's	 user 	 s 	 	from	,	you	know	,	 virtual 	 ly 	 	every	country	in	the	world	now	in	second	life	.
the	 domin 	 ant 	 	 one 	 s 	 	are	--	if	you	take	the	uk	and	europe	,	together	they	make	up	about	55	percent	of	the	 us 	 age 	 	base	in	second	life	.
in	 term 	 s 	 	of	psychographic	--	oh	,	men	and	women	:	men	and	women	are	 al 	 most 	 	 equal 	 ly 	 	 match 	 ed 	 	in	second	life	,	so	about	45	percent	of	the	people	 on 	 line 	 	right	now	on	second	life	are	women	.
women	use	second	life	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	about	30	to	40	percent	more	,	on	an	 hour 	 s 	 	 bas 	 is 	 	,	than	men	do	,	meaning	that	more	men	sign	up	than	women	,	and	more	women	stay	and	use	it	than	men	.
so	that	's	 an 	 other 	 	 demo 	 graphic 	 	fact	.
in	 term 	 s 	 	of	psychographic	,	you	know	,	the	people	in	second	life	are	 remark 	 ably 	 	 dis 	 similar 	 	 relat 	 ive 	 	to	what	you	might	think	,	when	you	go	in	and	talk	to	them	and	meet	them	,	and	i	would	,	you	know	,	 challeng 	 e 	 	you	to	just	do	 th 	 is 	 	and	find	out	.
but	it	's	not	a	bunch	of	 programm 	 ers 	 	.
it	's	not	easy	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 demo 	 graphic 	 	.
if	i	had	to	just	sort	of	paint	a	broad	picture	,	i	'd	say	,	remember	the	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 in 	 to 	 	ebay	in	the	first	few	 year 	 s 	 	of	ebay	?
 may 	 be 	 	a	little	bit	like	that	:	in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	people	who	are	early	 adopt 	 ers 	 	.
they	tend	to	be	creative	.	they	tend	to	be	 entrepreneur 	 ial 	 	.
a	lot	of	them	--	about	55,000	people	so	far	--	are	cash	-	flow	positive	:	they	're	making	money	from	what	--	i	mean	,	real	-	world	money	--	from	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	in	second	life	,	so	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	build	--	still	a	creative	,	building	 thing 	 s 	 	,	build	-	your	-	own	-	business	type	of	an	 orient 	 ation 	 	.	so	,	that	's	it	.
jh	:	you	 de 	 scribe 	 	 your 	 self 	 	,	philip	,	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 one 	 	who	was	 re 	 ally 	 	creative	when	you	 we 	 re 	 	young	and	,	you	know	,	 like 	 d 	 	to	make	 thing 	 s 	 	.
i	mean	,	it	's	not	often	that	you	hear	 some 	 body 	 	 de 	 scribe 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	creative	.
i	suspect	that	's	possibly	a	 euphem 	 ism 	 	for	c	student	who	 s 	 pent 	 	a	lot	of	time	in	his	room	?	is	it	possible	?
pr	:	i	was	a	--	there	 we 	 re 	 	 time 	 s 	 	i	was	a	c	student	.	you	know	,	it	's	funny	.
when	i	got	to	college	--	i	 stud 	 ied 	 	physics	in	college	--	and	i	got	 re 	 ally 	 	--	it	was	funny	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	 definite 	 ly 	 	a	more	 anti 	 social 	 	kid	.	i	read	all	the	time	.
i	was	 s 	 hy 	 	.	i	do	n't	seem	like	it	now	,	but	i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 hy 	 	.
 move 	 d 	 	around	a	bunch	--	had	that	experience	too	.
so	i	did	,	kind	of	,	i	think	,	live	in	my	own	world	,	and	 obvious 	 ly 	 	that	 help 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	engage	your	real	interest	in	 some 	 thing 	 	.
jh	:	so	you	're	on	your	fifth	life	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	?
pr	:	if	you	count	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	cities	.	so	--	but	i	did	--	and	i	did	n't	do	--	i	think	i	did	n't	do	 a 	 s 	 	well	in	school	 a 	 s 	 	i	could	have	.	i	think	you	're	right	.
i	was	n't	,	like	,	an	 obsess 	 ed 	 	--	you	know	,	get	a	's	kind	of	guy	.
i	was	going	to	say	,	i	had	a	great	social	experience	when	i	went	to	college	that	i	had	n't	had	before	,	a	more	 fratern 	 al 	 	experience	,	where	i	met	six	or	seven	other	 guy 	 s 	 	who	i	 stud 	 ied 	 	physics	with	,	and	i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	competitive	with	them	,	so	then	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	get	a	's	.	but	you	're	right	:	i	was	n't	an	a	student	.
jh	:	last	question	.	right	here	.
jh	:	you	want	to	 para 	 phrase 	 	that	?
pr	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	so	let	me	restate	that	.
so	,	you	're	 say 	 ing 	 	that	in	the	pamphlet	there	's	a	 state 	 ment 	 	that	we	may	come	to	prefer	our	digital	 s 	 elves 	 	to	our	real	 one 	 s 	 	--	our	more	 malle 	 able 	 	or	 manage 	 able 	 	digital	 ident 	 ities 	 	to	our	real	 ident 	 ities 	 	--	and	that	in	fact	,	much	of	human	life	and	human	experience	may	move	 in 	 to 	 	the	digital	realm	.
and	then	that	's	kind	of	a	 horr 	 ifying 	 	thought	,	of	course	.
that	's	a	 frighten 	 ing 	 	change	,	 frighten 	 ing 	 	 disrupt 	 ion 	 	.
i	guess	,	and	you	're	 ask 	 ing 	 	,	what	do	i	think	about	that	?	how	do	i	--	jh	:	what	's	your	 respons 	 e 	 	to	the	people	who	would	say	,	that	's	 horr 	 ifying 	 	?
(	audience	:	if	 some 	 one 	 	would	say	to	you	,	i	find	that	 disturb 	 ing 	 	,	what	would	be	your	 respons 	 e 	 	?	)	pr	:	well	,	i	'd	say	a	couple	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
one	is	,	it	's	 disturb 	 ing 	 	like	the	 inter 	 net 	 	or	 electric 	 ity 	 	was	.
that	is	to	say	,	it	's	a	big	change	,	but	it	is	n't	avoidable	.
so	,	no	amount	of	backpedaling	or	intentional	behavior	or	 politic 	 al 	 	behavior	is	going	to	keep	these	technology	 change 	 s 	 	from	 connect 	 ing 	 	us	together	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	motive	that	people	have	--	to	be	creative	and	 entrepreneur 	 ial 	 	--	is	going	to	drive	energy	 in 	 to 	 	these	virtual	 world 	 s 	 	in	the	same	way	that	it	 ha 	 s 	 	with	the	web	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	change	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	is	a	huge	 disrupt 	 ive 	 	change	.
 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	i	'm	the	optimist	and	a	big	 believ 	 er 	 	in	what	's	going	on	here	,	but	i	think	that	 a 	 s 	 	--	even	a	sober	,	you	know	,	the	most	sober	,	 dis 	 connect 	 ed 	 	 think 	 er 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	looking	at	it	from	the	side	,	 ha 	 s 	 	to	conclude	,	based	on	the	data	,	that	with	 t 	 hose 	 	 kind 	 s 	 	of	economic	 force 	 s 	 	at	play	,	there	is	 definite 	 ly 	 	going	to	be	a	sea	change	,	and	that	change	is	going	to	be	 intens 	 e 	 ly 	 	 disrupt 	 ive 	 	 relat 	 ive 	 	to	our	 con 	 cept 	 	of	our	 ver 	 y 	 	 live 	 s 	 	and	 be 	 ing 	 	,	and	our	 ident 	 ities 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
i	do	n't	think	we	can	get	away	from	 t 	 hose 	 	 change 	 s 	 	.
i	think	 general 	 ly 	 	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	--	i	think	that	 general 	 ly 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	present	in	a	virtual	world	and	 be 	 ing 	 	 challeng 	 ed 	 	by	it	,	 be 	 ing 	 	--	 surviv 	 ing 	 	there	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	good	life	there	,	so	to	speak	,	is	a	 challeng 	 e 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	multiculturality	of	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 language 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 entrepreneur 	 ial 	 	 rich 	 ness 	 	of	it	,	the	sort	of	flea	market	nature	,	if	you	will	,	of	the	virtual	world	 to 	 day 	 	.
it	 put 	 s 	 	 challeng 	 es 	 	on	us	to	rise	to	.	we	must	be	better	than	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	.
we	must	learn	 thing 	 s 	 	and	,	you	know	,	be	more	 toler 	 ant 	 	,	and	be	 smart 	 er 	 	and	learn	 fast 	 er 	 	and	be	more	creative	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	than	we	are	 typical 	 ly 	 	in	our	real	 live 	 s 	 	.
and	i	think	that	if	that	is	true	of	virtual	 world 	 s 	 	,	then	these	 change 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	 scar 	 y 	 	--	and	,	i	say	,	 inevit 	 able 	 	--	are	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	for	the	better	,	and	 there 	 fore 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	should	ride	out	.
but	i	would	say	that	--	and	 man 	 y 	 	other	 author 	 s 	 	and	 speaker 	 s 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	other	than	me	,	have	 s 	 aid 	 	,	you	know	,	 fast 	 en 	 	your	seat	 belt 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	change	is	coming	.	there	are	going	to	be	big	 change 	 s 	 	.
jh	:	philip	rosedale	,	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
