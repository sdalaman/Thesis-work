beverly	joubert	:	we	are	 tru 	 ly 	 	passionate	about	the	african	 wild 	 er 	 ness 	 	and	 protect 	 ing 	 	the	african	 wild 	 er 	 ness 	 	,
and	so	what	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	is	we	've	focused	on	 icon 	 ic 	 	 cat 	 s 	 	.
and	i	know	,	in	the	light	of	human	 suffer 	 ing 	 	and	poverty	and	even	climate	change	,	one	would	wonder	,	why	worry	about	a	few	 cat 	 s 	 	?
well	 to 	 day 	 	we	're	here	to	share	with	you	a	 mess 	 age 	 	that	we	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	and	special	character	--	 th 	 is 	 	leopard	.
dereck	joubert	:	well	,	our	 live 	 s 	 	have	 bas 	 ically 	 	 be 	 en 	 	like	a	super	long	episode	of	``	csi	``	--	 some 	 thing 	 	like	28	 year 	 s 	 	.
in	 es 	 s 	 ence 	 	,	what	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	is	we	've	 stud 	 ied 	 	the	science	,	we	've	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	behavior	,	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	over	2,000	 kill 	 s 	 	by	these	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	.
but	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	science	 re 	 ally 	 	lets	us	down	on	is	that	 personal 	 ity 	 	,	that	individual	 personal 	 ity 	 	that	these	 animal 	 s 	 	have	.
and	here	's	a	prime	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
we	found	 th 	 is 	 	leopard	in	a	2,000	-	year	-	old	 bao 	 bab 	 	tree	in	africa	,	the	same	tree	that	we	found	her	mother	in	and	her	 grand 	 mother 	 	.
and	she	took	us	on	a	journey	and	 reveal 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	special	to	us	--	her	own	daughter	,	eight	 day 	 s 	 	old	.
and	the	minute	we	found	 th 	 is 	 	leopard	,	we	 real 	 ized 	 	that	we	 need 	 ed 	 	to	move	in	,
and	so	we	 bas 	 ically 	 	 stay 	 ed 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	leopard	for	the	next	four	-	and	-	a	-	half	 year 	 s 	 	--	 follow 	 ing 	 	her	every	day	,	 get 	 ting 	 	to	know	her	,	that	individual	 personal 	 ity 	 	of	 her 	 s 	 	,	and	 re 	 ally 	 	coming	to	know	her	.
now	i	'm	destined	to	 s 	 pend 	 	a	lot	of	time	with	some	 un 	 ique 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	special	,	 individual 	 istic 	 	and	often	 s 	 e 	 duct 	 ive 	 	female	 character 	 s 	 	.	beverly	's	 clear 	 ly 	 	one	of	them	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	little	leopard	,	legadema	,	is	 an 	 other 	 	,	and	she	 change 	 d 	 	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
bj	:	well	we	 certain 	 ly 	 	did	 s 	 pend 	 	a	lot	of	time	with	her	--	in	fact	,	more	time	than	even	her	mother	did	.
when	her	mother	would	go	off	 hunt 	 ing 	 	,	we	would	stay	and	film	.
and	early	on	,	a	 light 	 ning 	 	bolt	hit	a	tree	20	 pace 	 s 	 	away	from	us	.
it	was	 frighten 	 ing 	 	,
and	it	 shower 	 ed 	 	us	with	 leav 	 es 	 	and	a	 pun 	 gent 	 	smell	.
and	of	course	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 stunn 	 ed 	 	for	a	while	,	but	when	we	 manage 	 d 	 	to	get	our	 wit 	 s 	 	about	us	,	we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	it	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	my	 go 	 sh 	 	,	what	's	going	to	happen	with	that	little	cub	?
she	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	going	to	 fore 	 ver 	 	associate	that	 deaf 	 en 	 ing 	 	crash	with	us	.	``
well	,	we	need	n't	have	 worri 	 ed 	 	.
she	came	charging	out	of	the	 thick 	 et 	 	straight	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	us	,	 s 	 at 	 	next	to	us	,	 shiver 	 ing 	 	,	with	her	back	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	dereck	,	and	looking	out	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	from	that	day	on	,	she	's	 be 	 en 	 	 comfort 	 able 	 	with	us	.
so	we	felt	that	that	day	was	the	day	that	she	 re 	 ally 	 	 earn 	 ed 	 	her	name	.
we	 call 	 ed 	 	her	legadema	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	,	``	light	from	the	sky	.	``
dj	:	now	we	've	found	these	 individual 	 ism 	 s 	 	in	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 animal 	 s 	 	,	in	 part 	 icular 	 	in	the	 cat 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	one	is	 call 	 ed 	 	eetwidomayloh	,	``	he	who	 greet 	 s 	 	with	fire	,	``
and	you	can	just	see	that	about	him	,	you	know	--	that	's	his	character	.
but	 on 	 ly 	 	by	 get 	 ting 	 	up	close	to	these	 animal 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	time	with	them	can	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	even	reach	out	and	dig	out	these	personal	 character 	 s 	 	that	they	have	.
bj	:	but	through	our	investigation	,	we	have	to	seek	the	 wild 	 est 	 	 place 	 s 	 	in	africa	.
and	right	now	 th 	 is 	 	is	in	the	okavango	 del 	 ta 	 	in	botswana	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	it	is	swamp	.	we	live	in	the	swamp	in	a	tent	,
but	i	must	tell	you	,	every	day	is	 exhila 	 rating 	 	.
but	 al 	 so 	 	,	our	 heart 	 s 	 	are	in	our	 throat 	 s 	 	a	huge	amount	of	the	time	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	 driv 	 ing 	 	through	water	,	and	it	's	an	 un 	 known 	 	 territ 	 ory 	 	.
but	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	there	seeking	and	 search 	 ing 	 	and	 film 	 ing 	 	the	 icon 	 ic 	 	 cat 	 s 	 	.
dj	:	now	one	of	the	big	 thing 	 s 	 	,	of	course	,	 every 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	that	 cat 	 s 	 	hate	water	,
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	real	 revel 	 ation 	 	for	us	.
and	we	could	 on 	 ly 	 	find	 th 	 is 	 	by	 push 	 ing 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	by	going	where	no	 s 	 ane 	 	person	should	go	--	not	 with 	 out 	 	some	 prompt 	 ing 	 	,	by	the	way	,	from	beverly	--	and	just	 push 	 ing 	 	the	 envelop 	 e 	 	,	going	out	there	,	 push 	 ing 	 	our	vehicle	,	 push 	 ing 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
but	we	've	 manage 	 d 	 	to	find	that	these	 lion 	 s 	 	are	15	percent	 big 	 ger 	 	than	any	 other 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 special 	 ize 	 	in	 hunt 	 ing 	 	buffalo	in	the	water	.
bj	:	and	then	of	course	,	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	is	 know 	 ing 	 	when	to	turn	around	.
we	do	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	get	that	right	,
and	on	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	day	,	we	 serious 	 ly 	 	 under 	 estimate 	 d 	 	the	depth	.
we	got	 deep 	 er 	 	and	 deep 	 er 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	it	was	at	dereck	's	chest	-	height	.
well	then	we	hit	a	deep	 depress 	 ion 	 	,	and	we	 serious 	 ly 	 	 sub 	 merge 	 d 	 	the	vehicle	.
we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 manage 	 d 	 	to	drown	two	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	'	worth	of	camera	gear	.
we	 drown 	 ed 	 	our	 pri 	 de 	 	,	i	must	tell	you	,	which	was	 re 	 ally 	 	serious	,	and	we	 s 	 e 	 ized 	 	the	engine	.
dj	:	and	of	course	,	one	of	the	 rule 	 s 	 	that	we	have	in	the	vehicle	is	that	he	who	 drown 	 s 	 	the	vehicle	 get 	 s 	 	to	swim	with	the	 crocodile 	 s 	 	.
you	will	notice	 al 	 so 	 	that	all	of	these	 image 	 s 	 	here	are	taken	from	the	top	angle	by	beverly	--	the	dry	top	angle	,	by	the	way	.
but	all	the	 place 	 s 	 	we	get	 s 	 tuck 	 	in	 re 	 ally 	 	have	great	 view 	 s 	 	.
and	it	was	n't	a	moment	,	and	these	 lion 	 s 	 	came	back	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	us	,	and	beverly	was	able	to	get	a	great	photograph	.
bj	:	but	we	 tru 	 ly 	 	do	 s 	 pend 	 	day	and	night	 try 	 ing 	 	to	capture	 un 	 ique 	 	 foot 	 age 	 	.
and	20	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	we	did	a	film	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 e 	 ternal 	 	 ene 	 mies 	 	``	where	we	 manage 	 d 	 	to	capture	 th 	 is 	 	 un 	 usual 	 	 disturb 	 ing 	 	behavior	 a 	 cross 	 	two	species	--	 lion 	 s 	 	and	 hyena 	 s 	 	.
and	 surprising 	 ly 	 	,	it	 be 	 came 	 	a	cult	film	.
and	we	can	 on 	 ly 	 	work	that	out	 a 	 s 	 	people	 we 	 re 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	 parallel 	 s 	 	between	the	 t 	 hugg 	 ish 	 	side	of	nature	and	gang	 war 	 fare 	 	.
dj	:	it	was	 amaz 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	can	see	that	 th 	 is 	 	lion	is	 do 	 ing 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	his	name	,	eetwidomayloh	,	 represent 	 s 	 	.
he	's	focused	on	 th 	 is 	 	hyena	,	and	he	is	going	to	get	it	.
but	that	's	,	i	think	,	what	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	about	,	is	that	these	 individual 	 s 	 	have	these	 personal 	 ities 	 	and	 character 	 s 	 	.
but	for	us	to	get	them	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	do	we	push	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	but	we	live	by	certain	 rule 	 s 	 	of	 engage 	 ment 	 	,	which	mean	we	ca	n't	interfere	.
 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	behavior	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	going	on	for	three	,	four	,	five	million	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	we	ca	n't	step	in	and	say	,	``	that	's	wrong	,	and	that	's	right	.	``
but	that	's	not	 al 	 ways 	 	easy	for	us	.
bj	:	so	,	 a 	 s 	 	dereck	 say 	 s 	 	,	we	have	to	work	through	 extrem 	 es 	 	--	 extrem 	 e 	 	 temperature 	 s 	 	,	push	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	at	night	.
sleep	 depriv 	 ation 	 	is	 extrem 	 e 	 	.
we	're	on	the	edge	through	a	large	part	of	the	time	.
but	,	for	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	capture	 lion 	 s 	 	and	 elephant 	 s 	 	together	--	and	never	ever	 manage 	 d 	 	 un 	 til 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	night	.
and	i	have	to	tell	you	that	it	was	a	 disturb 	 ing 	 	night	for	me	.
i	had	 tear 	 s 	 	 roll 	 ing 	 	down	my	 cheek 	 s 	 	.
i	was	 sha 	 king 	 	with	 anxie 	 ty 	 	,
but	i	 k 	 new 	 	that	[	i	had	]	to	capture	 some 	 thing 	 	that	had	never	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 een 	 	before	,	had	never	 be 	 en 	 	 document 	 ed 	 	.
and	i	do	 believ 	 e 	 	you	should	stay	with	us	.
dj	:	the	 amaz 	 ing 	 	thing	about	these	 moment 	 s 	 	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	a	 high 	 light 	 	of	our	 care 	 er 	 	--	is	that	you	never	know	how	it	's	going	to	end	.
 man 	 y 	 	people	 believ 	 e 	 	,	in	fact	,	that	death	 begin 	 s 	 	in	the	 eye 	 s 	 	,	not	in	the	heart	,	not	in	the	 lung 	 s 	 	,
and	that	's	when	people	give	up	hope	,	or	when	any	life	form	 give 	 s 	 	up	hope	.
and	you	can	see	the	start	of	it	here	.
 th 	 is 	 	elephant	,	against	 overwhelm 	 ing 	 	 odd 	 s 	 	,	 simpl 	 y 	 	 give 	 s 	 	up	hope	.
but	by	the	same	 to 	 ken 	 	,	you	can	get	your	hope	back	 aga 	 in 	 	.
so	just	when	you	think	it	's	all	over	,	 some 	 thing 	 	else	 happen 	 s 	 	,	some	spark	 get 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	you	,	some	sort	of	will	to	fight	--	that	iron	will	that	we	all	have	,	that	 th 	 is 	 	elephant	 ha 	 s 	 	,	that	 conserv 	 ation 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	,	that	big	 cat 	 s 	 	have	.
 every 	 thing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	that	will	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	,	to	fight	,	to	push	through	that	mental	 bar 	 rier 	 	and	to	keep	going	.
and	for	us	,	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	,	 th 	 is 	 	elephant	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	a	symbol	of	inspiration	for	us	,	a	symbol	of	that	hope	 a 	 s 	 	we	go	forward	in	our	work	.
now	back	to	the	leopard	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	so	much	time	with	 th 	 is 	 	leopard	and	 get 	 ting 	 	to	understand	her	 individual 	 ism 	 	,	her	personal	character	,	that	 may 	 be 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	taking	it	a	little	bit	far	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	taking	her	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	she	did	n't	like	that	that	much	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	about	 couple 	 s 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	together	,	and	so	i	do	need	to	say	that	 with 	 in 	 	the	vehicle	we	have	 quit 	 e 	 	strict	 territ 	 ories 	 	,	beverly	and	i	.
beverly	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	on	the	one	side	where	all	her	camera	gear	is	,	and	i	'm	on	the	other	side	where	my	space	is	.
these	are	precious	to	us	,	these	 divide 	 s 	 	.
bj	:	but	when	 th 	 is 	 	little	cub	saw	that	i	had	 vac 	 ated 	 	my	seat	and	 climb 	 ed 	 	to	the	back	to	get	some	camera	gear	,	she	came	in	like	a	 cur 	 ious 	 	cat	to	come	and	investigate	.
it	was	 phenomen 	 al 	 	,	and	we	felt	 grat 	 e 	 ful 	 	that	she	 trust 	 ed 	 	us	to	that	 ex 	 tent 	 	.
but	at	the	same	time	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 concern 	 ed 	 	that	if	she	 create 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	habit	and	 jump 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 body 	 	else	's	car	,	it	might	not	turn	out	the	same	way	--	she	might	get	shot	for	that	.
so	we	 k 	 new 	 	we	had	to	react	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
and	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	we	thought	we	could	 with 	 out 	 	 scar 	 ing 	 	her	is	to	try	and	 simul 	 ate 	 	a	 grow 	 l 	 	like	her	mother	would	make	--	a	 his 	 s 	 	and	a	sound	.
so	dereck	 turn 	 ed 	 	on	the	 heat 	 er 	 	fan	in	the	car	--	 ver 	 y 	 	 innov 	 ative 	 	.
dj	:	it	was	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	for	me	to	 s 	 ave 	 	the	marriage	,	 be 	 cause 	 	beverly	felt	she	was	 be 	 ing 	 	 replace 	 d 	 	,	you	see	.
but	 re 	 ally 	 	and	 tru 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	how	 th 	 is 	 	little	leopard	was	 dis 	 play 	 ing 	 	her	individual	 personal 	 ity 	 	.
but	 noth 	 ing 	 	prepared	us	for	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	next	in	our	relationship	with	her	,	when	she	 start 	 ed 	 	 hunt 	 ing 	 	.
bj	:	and	on	 th 	 is 	 	first	hunt	,	we	 tru 	 ly 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	.
it	was	like	 watch 	 ing 	 	a	 gradu 	 ation 	 	 ce 	 re 	 mon 	 y 	 	.
we	felt	like	we	 we 	 re 	 	 sur 	 rog 	 ate 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	.
and	of	course	,	we	 k 	 new 	 	now	that	she	was	going	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	.
but	 on 	 ly 	 	when	we	saw	the	 tin 	 y 	 	baby	baboon	 cl 	 ing 	 ing 	 	to	the	mother	's	fur	did	we	 real 	 ize 	 	that	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 ique 	 	was	taking	place	here	with	legadema	.
and	of	course	,	the	baby	baboon	was	so	 innoc 	 ent 	 	,	it	did	n't	turn	and	run	.
so	what	we	 watch 	 ed 	 	over	the	next	couple	of	 hour 	 s 	 	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 ique 	 	.
it	was	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	when	she	 pick 	 ed 	 	it	up	to	 safe 	 ty 	 	,	 protect 	 ing 	 	it	from	the	hyena	.
and	over	the	next	five	 hour 	 s 	 	,	she	took	care	of	it	.
we	 real 	 ized 	 	that	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	n't	know	 every 	 thing 	 	,	and	that	nature	is	so	 un 	 predict 	 able 	 	,	we	have	to	be	open	at	all	 time 	 s 	 	.
dj	:	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	she	was	a	little	bit	rough	.
but	in	fact	,	what	we	 we 	 re 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	here	was	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	she	is	a	cub	 want 	 ing 	 	to	play	,	but	she	was	 al 	 so 	 	a	predator	 need 	 ing 	 	to	kill	,	and	yet	 conflict 	 ed 	 	in	some	way	,	 be 	 cause 	 	she	was	 al 	 so 	 	an	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	mother	.
she	had	 th 	 is 	 	 ma 	 ternal 	 	instinct	,	much	like	a	young	girl	on	her	way	to	 woman 	 hood 	 	,
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	took	us	to	 th 	 is 	 	new	level	of	 understand 	 ing 	 	that	 personal 	 ity 	 	.
bj	:	and	of	course	,	through	the	night	,	they	lay	together	.
they	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 sleep 	 ing 	 	for	 hour 	 s 	 	.
but	i	have	to	tell	you	--	 every 	 body 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 ask 	 s 	 	,	``	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	the	baby	baboon	?	``
it	did	die	,
and	we	suspect	it	was	from	the	freezing	winter	 night 	 s 	 	.
dj	:	so	at	 th 	 is 	 	stage	,	i	guess	,	we	had	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	firm	 idea 	 s 	 	on	what	 conserv 	 ation 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	.
we	had	to	deal	with	these	individual	 personal 	 ities 	 	.
we	had	to	deal	with	them	with	respect	and	 celebr 	 ate 	 	them	.
and	so	we	,	with	the	national	 geo 	 graphic 	 	,	 form 	 ed 	 	the	big	 cat 	 s 	 	 initi 	 ative 	 	to	march	forward	 in 	 to 	 	 conserv 	 ation 	 	,	taking	care	of	the	big	 cat 	 s 	 	that	we	 love 	 d 	 	--	and	then	had	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	look	back	over	the	last	50	 year 	 s 	 	to	see	how	well	we	had	all	 collect 	 ively 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	.
so	when	beverly	and	i	 we 	 re 	 	born	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	450,000	 lion 	 s 	 	,	and	 to 	 day 	 	there	are	20,000	.
 tiger 	 s 	 	have	n't	 far 	 ed 	 	any	better	--	45,000	down	to	 may 	 be 	 	3,000	.
bj	:	and	then	 cheetah 	 s 	 	have	 crash 	 ed 	 	all	the	way	down	to	12,000	.
 leopard 	 s 	 	have	 plummet 	 ed 	 	from	700,000	down	to	a	mere	50,000	.
now	in	the	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	time	that	we	have	 work 	 ed 	 	with	legadema	--	which	is	 re 	 ally 	 	over	a	five	-	year	period	--	10,000	 leopard 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 legal 	 ly 	 	shot	by	safari	 hunter 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 leopard 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 kill 	 ed 	 	through	that	period	.
there	's	an	immense	amount	of	 po 	 ach 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	,
and	so	possibly	the	same	amount	.
it	's	 simpl 	 y 	 	not	 sustain 	 able 	 	.
we	admire	them	,	and	we	fear	them	,
and	yet	,	 a 	 s 	 	man	,	we	want	to	steal	 the 	 ir 	 	power	.
it	used	to	be	the	time	where	 on 	 ly 	 	 king 	 s 	 	 wo 	 re 	 	a	leopard	skin	,	but	now	 through 	 out 	 	 ritual 	 s 	 	and	 ceremoni 	 es 	 	,	 tradition 	 al 	 	 heal 	 ers 	 	and	 mini 	 sters 	 	.
and	of	course	,	looking	at	 th 	 is 	 	lion	paw	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 skin 	 ned 	 	,	it	 eer 	 ily 	 	 re 	 mind 	 s 	 	me	of	a	human	hand	,
and	that	's	 iron 	 ic 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	fate	is	in	our	 hand 	 s 	 	.
dj	:	there	's	a	 burg 	 eon 	 ing 	 	bone	trade	.
south	africa	just	released	some	lion	 bone 	 s 	 	onto	the	market	.
lion	 bone 	 s 	 	and	tiger	 bone 	 s 	 	look	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	,	and	so	in	a	stroke	,	the	lion	bone	industry	is	going	to	wipe	out	all	the	 tiger 	 s 	 	.
so	we	have	a	real	problem	here	,	no	more	so	than	the	 lion 	 s 	 	do	,	the	male	 lion 	 s 	 	.
so	the	20,000	lion	figure	that	you	just	saw	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	red	 her 	 ring 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	may	be	3,000	or	4,000	male	 lion 	 s 	 	,	and	they	all	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 infect 	 ed 	 	with	the	same	disease	.
i	call	it	 com 	 place 	 ncy 	 	--	our	 com 	 place 	 ncy 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	a	 s 	 port 	 	,	there	's	an	activity	going	on	that	we	're	all	aware	of	,	that	we	 con 	 d 	 one 	 	.
and	that	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	n't	 s 	 een 	 	it	like	we	are	 to 	 day 	 	.
bj	:	and	you	have	to	know	that	,	when	a	male	lion	is	 kill 	 ed 	 	,	it	 complete 	 ly 	 	 disrupt 	 s 	 	the	whole	 pri 	 de 	 	.
a	new	male	 come 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	area	and	 take 	 s 	 	over	the	 pri 	 de 	 	,	and	,	of	course	,	first	of	all	 kill 	 s 	 	all	the	 cub 	 s 	 	and	possibly	some	of	the	 female 	 s 	 	that	are	 defend 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 cub 	 s 	 	.
so	we	've	 estimate 	 d 	 	that	between	20	[	and	]	30	 lion 	 s 	 	are	 kill 	 ed 	 	when	one	lion	is	 hang 	 ing 	 	on	a	wall	 some 	 where 	 	in	a	far	-	off	place	.
dj	:	so	what	our	 investigation 	 s 	 	have	 show 	 n 	 	is	that	these	 lion 	 s 	 	are	essential	.
they	're	essential	to	the	 habit 	 at 	 	.
if	they	disappear	,	whole	 eco 	 system 	 s 	 	in	africa	disappear	.
there	's	an	80	-	billion	-	dollar	-	a	-	year	 eco 	 tour 	 ism 	 	revenue	stream	 in 	 to 	 	africa	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	just	a	concern	about	 lion 	 s 	 	;	it	's	a	concern	about	 commun 	 ities 	 	in	africa	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
if	they	disappear	,	all	of	that	 go 	 es 	 	away	.
but	what	i	'm	more	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	is	that	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	de	-	link	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	from	nature	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	de	-	link	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 spiritual 	 ly 	 	from	these	 animal 	 s 	 	,	we	lose	hope	,	we	lose	that	spiritual	 connect 	 ion 	 	,	our	dignity	,	that	thing	 with 	 in 	 	us	that	 keep 	 s 	 	us	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	the	planet	.
bj	:	so	you	have	to	know	,	looking	 in 	 to 	 	the	 eye 	 s 	 	of	 lion 	 s 	 	and	 leopard 	 s 	 	right	now	,	it	is	all	about	critical	 aware 	 ness 	 	.
and	so	what	we	are	 do 	 ing 	 	,	in	february	,	we	're	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	out	a	film	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	last	lion	,	``
and	``	the	last	lion	``	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	right	now	.
that	is	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	we	're	in	--	the	last	 lion 	 s 	 	.
that	is	,	if	we	do	n't	take	action	and	do	 some 	 thing 	 	,	these	 plain 	 s 	 	will	be	 complete 	 ly 	 	 de 	 void 	 	of	big	 cat 	 s 	 	,	and	then	,	in	turn	,	 every 	 thing 	 	else	will	disappear	.
and	 simpl 	 y 	 	,	if	we	ca	n't	protect	them	,	we	're	going	to	have	a	job	 protect 	 ing 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
dj	:	and	in	fact	,	that	original	thing	that	we	spoke	about	and	designed	our	 live 	 s 	 	by	--	that	 conserv 	 ation 	 	was	all	about	respect	and	 celebr 	 ation 	 	--	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	true	.	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	what	it	 need 	 s 	 	.
we	need	it	.	we	respect	and	 celebr 	 ate 	 	each	other	 a 	 s 	 	a	man	and	a	woman	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	community	and	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	planet	,	and	we	need	to	 continu 	 e 	 	that	.
and	legadema	?
well	we	can	report	,	in	fact	,	that	we	're	 grand 	 parent 	 s 	 	.
bj	/	dj	:	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
