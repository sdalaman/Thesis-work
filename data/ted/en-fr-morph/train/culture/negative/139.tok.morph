what	i	want	to	talk	to	you	about	 to 	 day 	 	is	virtual	 world 	 s 	 	,	digital	 glob 	 es 	 	,	the	3	-	d	web	,	the	metaverse	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	all	mean	for	us	?
what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	is	the	web	is	going	to	 be 	 come 	 	an	 excit 	 ing 	 	place	 aga 	 in 	 	.
it	's	going	to	 be 	 come 	 	super	 excit 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	transform	to	 th 	 is 	 	 high 	 ly 	 	 immers 	 ive 	 	and	 inter 	 active 	 	world	.	with	 graphic 	 s 	 	,	computing	power	,	low	 lat 	 encies 	 	,	these	 type 	 s 	 	of	 application 	 s 	 	and	 possibil 	 ities 	 	are	going	to	stream	rich	data	 in 	 to 	 	your	 live 	 s 	 	.
so	the	virtual	earth	 initi 	 ative 	 	,	and	other	 type 	 s 	 	of	these	 initi 	 ative 	 s 	 	,	are	all	about	 extend 	 ing 	 	our	current	search	metaphor	.
when	you	think	about	it	,	we	're	so	 con 	 s 	 trained 	 	by	 brow 	 s 	 ing 	 	the	web	,	 remember 	 ing 	 	urls	,	saving	 favor 	 ites 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	we	move	to	search	,	we	 re 	 ly 	 	on	the	relevance	 rank 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	the	web	 match 	 ing 	 	,	the	index	 crawl 	 ing 	 	.	but	we	want	to	use	our	brain	!
we	want	to	 navig 	 ate 	 	,	explore	,	discover	information	.
in	order	to	do	that	,	we	have	to	put	you	 a 	 s 	 	a	user	back	in	the	driver	's	seat	.
we	need	 co 	 operation 	 	between	you	and	the	computing	network	and	the	computer	.
so	what	better	way	to	put	you	back	in	the	driver	's	seat	than	to	put	you	in	the	real	world	that	you	interact	in	every	day	?
why	not	leverage	the	 learn 	 ing 	 s 	 	that	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	your	entire	life	?
so	virtual	earth	is	about	 start 	 ing 	 	off	creating	the	first	digital	 represent 	 ation 	 	,	 comprehens 	 ive 	 	,	of	the	entire	world	.
what	we	want	to	do	is	mix	in	all	 type 	 s 	 	of	data	.
tag	it	.	 attribut 	 e 	 	it	.	 meta 	 data 	 	.	get	the	community	to	add	local	depth	,	global	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	local	knowledge	.
so	when	you	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	problem	,	what	an	enormous	 under 	 taking 	 	.	where	do	you	begin	?
well	,	we	collect	data	from	 satellite 	 s 	 	,	from	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	,	from	ground	 vehicle 	 s 	 	,	from	people	.
 th 	 is 	 	process	is	an	 engineer 	 ing 	 	problem	,	a	 mechanic 	 al 	 	problem	,	a	 logist 	 ical 	 	problem	,	an	 operation 	 al 	 	problem	.
here	is	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	our	 a 	 erial 	 	camera	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 pan 	 chromatic 	 	.	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	four	color	 con 	 es 	 	.
in	 add 	 ition 	 	,	it	's	multi	-	spectral	.
we	collect	four	 giga 	 bits 	 	per	second	of	data	,	if	you	can	imagine	that	kind	of	data	stream	coming	down	.
that	's	 equi 	 valent 	 	to	a	 con 	 s 	 tell 	 ation 	 	of	12	 satellite 	 s 	 	at	highest	 re 	 s 	 	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	.
we	fly	these	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	at	5,000	feet	in	the	air	.	you	can	see	the	camera	on	the	front	.	we	collect	 multi 	 ple 	 	 view 	 point 	 s 	 	,	 van 	 t 	 age 	 	 point 	 s 	 	,	 angle 	 s 	 	,	 text 	 ures 	 	.	we	 br 	 ing 	 	all	that	data	back	in	.
we	 s 	 it 	 	here	--	you	know	,	think	about	the	ground	 vehicle 	 s 	 	,	the	human	scale	--	what	do	you	see	in	person	?	we	need	to	capture	that	up	close	to	establish	that	what	it	's	like	-	type	experience	.
i	bet	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	have	 s 	 een 	 	the	apple	 commercial 	 s 	 	,	kind	of	 po 	 king 	 	at	the	pc	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 brilli 	 ance 	 	and	 simpl 	 icity 	 	.
so	a	little	 un 	 known 	 	secret	is	--	did	you	see	the	one	with	the	guy	,	he	's	got	the	web	cam	?
the	poor	pc	guy	.	they	're	duct	 tap 	 ing 	 	his	head	.	they	're	just	 wrap 	 ping 	 	it	on	him	.
well	,	a	little	 un 	 known 	 	secret	is	his	brother	 actual 	 ly 	 	 work 	 s 	 	on	the	virtual	earth	team	.
.	so	they	've	got	a	little	bit	of	a	 s 	 i 	 bling 	 	 rival 	 ry 	 	thing	going	on	here	.
but	let	me	tell	you	--	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	affect	his	day	job	.
we	think	a	lot	of	good	can	come	from	 th 	 is 	 	technology	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	after	katrina	.	we	 we 	 re 	 	the	first	commercial	fleet	of	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	to	be	 clear 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	disaster	impact	zone	.
we	flew	the	area	.	we	 image 	 d 	 	it	.	we	 s 	 ent 	 	in	people	.	we	took	 picture 	 s 	 	of	 in 	 terior 	 s 	 	,	disaster	 area 	 s 	 	.	we	 help 	 ed 	 	with	the	first	 respond 	 ers 	 	,	the	search	and	 rescu 	 e 	 	.
often	the	first	time	 any 	 one 	 	saw	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	house	was	on	virtual	earth	.
we	made	it	all	 free 	 ly 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	on	the	web	,	just	to	--	it	was	 obvious 	 ly 	 	our	chance	of	 help 	 ing 	 	out	with	the	cause	.
when	we	think	about	how	all	 th 	 is 	 	 come 	 s 	 	together	,	it	's	all	about	 soft 	 ware 	 	,	 algorithm 	 s 	 	and	math	.
you	know	,	we	capture	 th 	 is 	 	 image 	 ry 	 	but	to	build	the	3	-	d	 model 	 s 	 	we	need	to	do	geo	-	 position 	 ing 	 	.	we	need	to	do	geo	-	registering	of	the	 image 	 s 	 	.
we	have	to	 bundl 	 e 	 	adjust	them	.	find	tie	 point 	 s 	 	.
 ex 	 tract 	 	 geo 	 metry 	 	from	the	 image 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	process	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 calcul 	 ated 	 	process	.
in	fact	,	it	was	 al 	 ways 	 	 d 	 one 	 	manual	.
hollywood	would	 s 	 pend 	 	 million 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	do	a	small	urban	corridor	for	a	movie	 be 	 cause 	 	they	'd	have	to	do	it	 manual 	 ly 	 	.
they	'd	drive	the	 street 	 s 	 	with	 laser 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	lidar	.
they	'd	 collect 	 ed 	 	information	with	 photo 	 s 	 	.	they	'd	 manual 	 ly 	 	build	each	building	.
we	do	 th 	 is 	 	all	through	 soft 	 ware 	 	,	 algorithm 	 s 	 	and	math	--	a	 high 	 ly 	 	 autom 	 ated 	 	 pipe 	 line 	 	creating	these	cities	.
we	took	a	decimal	point	off	what	it	cost	to	build	these	cities	,	and	that	's	how	we	're	going	to	be	able	to	scale	 th 	 is 	 	out	and	make	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	a	dream	.
we	think	about	the	user	 inter 	 face 	 	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	it	mean	to	look	at	it	from	 multi 	 ple 	 	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 s 	 	?
an	ortho	-	view	,	a	nadir	-	view	.	how	do	you	keep	the	 pre 	 cis 	 ion 	 	of	the	fidelity	of	the	 image 	 ry 	 	while	 maintain 	 ing 	 	the	 fluid 	 ity 	 	of	the	model	?
i	'll	wrap	up	by	 show 	 ing 	 	you	the	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	brand	-	new	peek	i	have	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 show 	 n 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	lab	area	of	virtual	earth	.
what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	is	--	people	like	 th 	 is 	 	a	lot	,	 th 	 is 	 	bird	's	eye	 image 	 ry 	 	we	work	with	.	it	's	 th 	 is 	 	high	 re 	 solution 	 	data	.
but	what	we	've	found	is	they	like	the	 fluid 	 ity 	 	of	the	3	-	d	model	.
a	child	can	 navig 	 ate 	 	with	an	xbox	 controll 	 er 	 	or	a	game	 controll 	 er 	 	.
so	here	what	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	is	we	 br 	 ing 	 	the	picture	and	project	it	 in 	 to 	 	the	3	-	d	model	space	.
you	can	see	all	 type 	 s 	 	of	 re 	 solution 	 	.	from	here	,	i	can	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	pan	the	image	over	.
i	can	get	the	next	image	.	i	can	blend	and	 transit 	 ion 	 	.
by	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	i	do	n't	lose	the	original	detail	.	in	fact	,	i	might	be	 record 	 ing 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
the	 fresh 	 ness 	 	,	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	.	i	can	turn	 th 	 is 	 	image	.
i	can	look	at	it	from	 multi 	 ple 	 	 view 	 point 	 s 	 	and	 angle 	 s 	 	.
what	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	is	build	a	virtual	world	.
we	hope	that	we	can	make	computing	a	user	model	you	're	familiar	with	,	and	 re 	 ally 	 	 der 	 ive 	 	 in 	 sight 	 s 	 	from	you	,	from	all	different	 direction 	 s 	 	.
i	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	for	your	time	.
