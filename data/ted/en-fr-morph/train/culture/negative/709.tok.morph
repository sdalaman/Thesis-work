good	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
i	've	come	here	to	share	with	you	an	experiment	of	how	to	get	rid	of	one	form	of	human	 suffer 	 ing 	 	.
it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	a	story	of	dr.	venkataswamy	.
his	mission	and	his	 mess 	 age 	 	is	about	the	aravind	eye	care	system	.
i	think	first	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	for	us	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	what	it	is	to	be	blind	.
woman	:	 every 	 where 	 	i	went	looking	for	work	,	they	 s 	 aid 	 	no	,	what	use	do	we	have	for	a	blind	woman	?
i	could	n't	 th 	 read 	 	a	needle	or	see	the	 lic 	 e 	 	in	my	hair	.
if	an	ant	fell	 in 	 to 	 	my	rice	,	i	could	n't	see	that	either	.
thulasiraj	ravilla	:	 be 	 coming 	 	blind	is	a	big	part	of	it	,	but	i	think	it	 al 	 so 	 	 depriv 	 es 	 	the	person	of	 the 	 ir 	 	livelihood	,	 the 	 ir 	 	dignity	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 in 	 depend 	 ence 	 	,	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 stat 	 us 	 	in	the	family	.
so	she	is	just	one	 among 	 st 	 	the	 million 	 s 	 	who	are	blind	.
and	the	 iron 	 y 	 	is	that	they	do	n't	need	to	be	.
a	simple	,	well	-	proven	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	can	 re 	 store 	 	sight	to	 million 	 s 	 	,	and	 some 	 thing 	 	even	 simpl 	 er 	 	,	a	pair	of	 glass 	 es 	 	,	can	make	 million 	 s 	 	more	see	.
if	we	add	to	that	the	 man 	 y 	 	of	us	here	now	who	are	more	productive	 be 	 cause 	 	they	have	a	pair	of	 glass 	 es 	 	,	then	 al 	 most 	 	one	in	five	 in 	 d 	 ians 	 	will	 requir 	 e 	 	eye	care	,	a	 stagger 	 ing 	 	200	million	people	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	we	're	 reach 	 ing 	 	not	even	10	percent	of	them	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 con 	 text 	 	in	which	aravind	came	 in 	 to 	 	 exist 	 ence 	 	about	30	 year 	 s 	 	back	 a 	 s 	 	a	post	-	 retire 	 ment 	 	project	of	dr.	v	.
he	 start 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	with	no	money	.
he	had	to	mortgage	all	his	life	 saving 	 s 	 	to	make	a	bank	loan	.
and	over	time	,	we	have	grown	 in 	 to 	 	a	network	of	five	 hospital 	 s 	 	,	 pre 	 dominate 	 ly 	 	in	the	state	of	tamil	nadu	and	puducherry	,	and	then	we	 add 	 ed 	 	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	,	what	we	call	vision	 center 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	hub	-	and	-	spoke	model	.
and	then	more	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 man 	 aging 	 	 hospital 	 s 	 	in	other	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	country	and	 al 	 so 	 	setting	up	 hospital 	 s 	 	in	other	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	world	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
the	last	three	 decade 	 s 	 	,	we	have	 d 	 one 	 	about	three	-	and	-	a	-	half	million	 s 	 urge 	 ries 	 	,	a	vast	 major 	 ity 	 	of	them	for	the	poor	people	.
now	,	each	year	we	perform	about	300,000	 s 	 urge 	 ries 	 	.
a	typical	day	at	aravind	,	we	would	do	about	a	thousand	 s 	 urge 	 ries 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	see	about	6,000	 patient 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 end 	 	out	 team 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 village 	 s 	 	to	examine	,	 br 	 ing 	 	back	 patient 	 s 	 	,	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 tele 	 medicine 	 	 consult 	 ations 	 	,	and	,	on	top	of	that	,	do	a	lot	of	training	,	both	for	 doctor 	 s 	 	and	 technician 	 s 	 	who	will	 be 	 come 	 	the	future	staff	of	aravind	.
and	then	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	day	-	in	and	day	-	out	,	and	 do 	 ing 	 	it	well	,	 requir 	 es 	 	a	lot	of	inspiration	and	a	lot	of	hard	work	.
and	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	was	possible	 thank 	 s 	 	to	the	building	 block 	 s 	 	put	in	place	by	dr.	 v 	 . 	 	,	a	value	system	,	an	efficient	 deliver 	 y 	 	process	,	and	 foster 	 ing 	 	the	culture	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
dr.	v	:	i	used	to	 s 	 it 	 	with	the	 ordin 	 ary 	 	village	man	 be 	 cause 	 	i	am	from	a	village	,	and	 sudden 	 ly 	 	you	turn	around	and	seem	to	be	in	contact	with	his	inner	 be 	 ing 	 	,	you	seem	to	be	one	with	him	.
here	is	a	soul	which	 ha 	 s 	 	got	all	the	 simpl 	 icity 	 	of	confidence	.
doctor	,	 what 	 ever 	 	you	say	,	i	accept	it	.
an	 im 	 plicit 	 	faith	in	you	and	then	you	respond	to	it	.
here	is	an	old	 lad 	 y 	 	who	 ha 	 s 	 	got	so	much	faith	in	me	,	i	must	do	my	best	for	her	.
when	we	grow	in	spiritual	 conscious 	 ness 	 	,	we	identify	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	with	all	that	is	in	the	world	,	so	there	is	no	 exploit 	 ation 	 	.
it	is	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	we	are	 help 	 ing 	 	.
it	is	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	we	are	 heal 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 help 	 ed 	 	us	build	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 ethic 	 al 	 	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 high 	 ly 	 	patient	-	centric	 organ 	 ization 	 	and	 system 	 s 	 	that	support	it	.
but	on	a	practical	level	,	you	 al 	 so 	 	have	to	deliver	 service 	 s 	 	 efficient 	 ly 	 	,	and	,	odd	 a 	 s 	 	it	may	seem	,	the	inspiration	came	from	mcdonald	's	.
dr.	v	:	see	,	mcdonald	's	'	 con 	 cept 	 	is	simple	.
they	feel	they	can	train	people	all	over	the	world	,	 ir 	 respect 	 ive 	 	of	different	 relig 	 ions 	 	,	 culture 	 s 	 	,	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	to	produce	a	product	in	the	same	way	and	deliver	it	in	the	same	manner	in	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 place 	 s 	 	.
larry	 brilli 	 ant 	 	:	he	 ke 	 pt 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	mcdonalds	and	 ham 	 burger 	 s 	 	,	and	 non 	 e 	 	of	it	made	any	sense	to	us	.
he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	create	a	franchise	,	a	 mechan 	 ism 	 	of	 deliver 	 y 	 	of	eye	care	with	the	efficiency	of	mcdonald	's	.
dr.	v	:	 s 	 up 	 posing 	 	i	'm	able	to	produce	eye	care	,	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	,	 method 	 s 	 	,	all	in	the	same	way	,	and	make	it	 avail 	 able 	 	in	every	corner	of	the	world	.
the	problem	of	 blind 	 ness 	 	is	gone	.
tr	:	if	you	think	about	it	,	i	think	the	 eye 	 ball 	 	is	the	same	,	 a 	 s 	 	american	or	african	,	the	problem	is	the	same	,	the	 treat 	 ment 	 	is	the	same	.
and	yet	,	why	should	there	be	so	much	 vari 	 ation 	 	in	quality	and	in	service	,	and	that	was	the	fundamental	principle	that	we	 follow 	 ed 	 	when	we	designed	the	 deliver 	 y 	 	 system 	 s 	 	.
and	,	of	course	,	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	was	that	it	's	a	huge	problem	,	we	are	 talk 	 ing 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	people	,	 ver 	 y 	 	little	resource	to	deal	with	it	,	and	then	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 logist 	 ic 	 s 	 	and	 afford 	 ability 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	.
and	then	so	,	one	had	to	 constant 	 ly 	 	 innov 	 ate 	 	.
and	one	of	the	early	 innov 	 ations 	 	,	which	still	 continu 	 es 	 	,	is	to	create	 owner 	 ship 	 	in	the	community	to	the	problem	,	and	then	engage	with	them	 a 	 s 	 	a	partner	,	and	here	is	one	 s 	 uch 	 	event	.	here	a	community	camp	just	 organize 	 d 	 	by	the	community	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	where	they	find	a	place	,	organize	 volunteer 	 s 	 	,	and	then	we	'll	do	our	part	.	you	know	,	check	 the 	 ir 	 	vision	,	and	then	you	have	 doctor 	 s 	 	who	you	find	out	what	the	problem	is	and	then	determine	what	further	 test 	 ing 	 	should	be	 d 	 one 	 	,	and	then	 t 	 hose 	 	 test 	 s 	 	are	 d 	 one 	 	by	 technician 	 s 	 	who	check	for	 glass 	 es 	 	,	or	check	for	glaucoma	.
and	then	,	with	all	these	 result 	 s 	 	,	the	doctor	 make 	 s 	 	a	final	 diagnos 	 is 	 	,	and	then	 pre 	 scribe 	 s 	 	a	line	of	 treat 	 ment 	 	,	and	if	they	need	a	pair	of	 glass 	 es 	 	,	they	are	 avail 	 able 	 	right	there	at	the	camp	 s 	 ite 	 	,	 usual 	 ly 	 	under	a	tree	.
but	they	get	 glass 	 es 	 	in	the	 frame 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	choice	,	and	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	 glass 	 es 	 	,	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	 help 	 ing 	 	people	see	,	is	 al 	 so 	 	a	fashion	 state 	 ment 	 	,	and	they	're	 will 	 ing 	 	to	pay	for	it	.
so	they	get	it	in	about	20	 minute 	 s 	 	and	 t 	 hose 	 	who	 requir 	 e 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	,	are	 counsel 	 ed 	 	,	and	then	there	are	 bus 	 es 	 	 wait 	 ing 	 	,	which	will	transport	them	to	the	base	hospital	.
and	if	it	was	not	for	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 logist 	 ic 	 s 	 	and	support	,	 man 	 y 	 	people	like	 th 	 is 	 	would	 prob 	 ably 	 	never	get	 service 	 s 	 	,	and	 certain 	 ly 	 	not	when	they	most	need	it	.
they	 receiv 	 e 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	day	,	and	then	they	will	stay	for	a	day	or	two	,	and	then	they	are	put	back	on	the	 bus 	 es 	 	to	be	taken	back	to	where	they	came	from	,	and	where	 the 	 ir 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	will	be	 wait 	 ing 	 	to	take	them	back	home	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	thousand	 time 	 s 	 	each	year	.
it	may	sound	 impress 	 ive 	 	that	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 patient 	 s 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	efficient	process	,	but	we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	,	are	we	solving	the	problem	?
we	did	a	 stud 	 y 	 	,	a	 scientific 	 ally 	 	designed	process	,	and	then	,	to	our	 dis 	 may 	 	,	we	found	 th 	 is 	 	was	 on 	 ly 	 	 reach 	 ing 	 	seven	percent	of	 t 	 hose 	 	in	need	,	and	we	're	not	 ad 	 equate 	 ly 	 	 address 	 ing 	 	more	,	 big 	 ger 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	.
so	we	had	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	different	,	so	we	set	up	what	we	call	 prim 	 ary 	 	eye	care	 center 	 s 	 	,	vision	 center 	 s 	 	.
these	are	 tru 	 ly 	 	 paper 	 less 	 	 off 	 ice 	 s 	 	with	 complete 	 ly 	 	 electron 	 ic 	 	medical	 record 	 s 	 	and	so	on	.
they	 receiv 	 e 	 	 comprehens 	 ive 	 	eye	 ex 	 am 	 s 	 	.
we	kind	of	 change 	 d 	 	the	simple	digital	camera	 in 	 to 	 	a	 retina 	 l 	 	camera	,	and	then	every	patient	 get 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 tele 	 consult 	 ation 	 	with	a	doctor	.
the	effect	of	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	that	,	 with 	 in 	 	the	first	year	,	we	 re 	 ally 	 	had	a	40	percent	 penet 	 ration 	 	in	the	market	that	it	 serv 	 ed 	 	,	which	is	over	50,000	people	.
and	the	second	year	went	up	to	75	percent	.
so	i	think	we	have	a	process	by	which	we	can	 re 	 ally 	 	penetrate	 in 	 to 	 	the	market	and	reach	 every 	 one 	 	who	 need 	 s 	 	it	,	and	in	 th 	 is 	 	process	of	using	technology	,	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	most	do	n't	need	to	come	to	the	base	hospital	.
and	how	much	will	they	pay	for	 th 	 is 	 	?
we	 fix 	 ed 	 	the	 pric 	 ing 	 	,	taking	 in 	 to 	 	account	what	they	would	 s 	 ave 	 	in	bus	fare	in	coming	to	a	city	,	so	they	pay	about	20	 rupee 	 s 	 	,	and	that	's	good	for	three	 consult 	 ations 	 	.
the	other	 challeng 	 e 	 	was	,	how	do	you	give	high	-	tech	or	more	 advance 	 d 	 	 treat 	 ment 	 	and	care	?
we	designed	a	van	with	a	vsat	,	which	 s 	 end 	 s 	 	out	 image 	 s 	 	of	 patient 	 s 	 	to	the	base	hospital	where	it	is	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	,	and	then	 a 	 s 	 	the	patient	is	 wait 	 ing 	 	,	the	report	 go 	 es 	 	back	to	the	patient	,	it	 get 	 s 	 	 print 	 ed 	 	out	,	the	patient	 get 	 s 	 	it	,	and	then	 get 	 s 	 	a	 consult 	 ation 	 	about	what	they	should	be	 do 	 ing 	 	--	i	mean	,	go	see	a	doctor	or	come	back	after	six	 month 	 s 	 	,	and	then	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	way	of	 brid 	 ging 	 	the	technology	 compete 	 nce 	 	.
so	the	impact	of	all	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 essential 	 ly 	 	one	of	growing	the	market	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	focused	on	the	non	-	 custom 	 er 	 	,	and	then	by	 reach 	 ing 	 	the	 un 	 reach 	 ed 	 	,	we	're	able	to	 significant 	 ly 	 	grow	the	market	.
the	other	 a 	 spect 	 	is	how	do	you	deal	with	 th 	 is 	 	 efficient 	 ly 	 	when	you	have	 ver 	 y 	 	few	 ophthalmo 	 logists 	 	?
so	what	is	in	 th 	 is 	 	video	is	a	surgeon	 oper 	 ating 	 	,	and	then	you	see	on	the	other	side	,	 an 	 other 	 	patient	is	 get 	 ting 	 	ready	.
so	,	 a 	 s 	 	they	finish	the	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	,	they	just	 s 	 wing 	 	the	 micro 	 scope 	 	over	,	the	 table 	 s 	 	are	 place 	 d 	 	so	that	 the 	 ir 	 	distance	is	just	right	,	and	then	we	need	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	by	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	process	,	we	're	able	to	more	than	quadruple	the	 product 	 ivity 	 	of	the	surgeon	.
and	then	to	support	the	surgeon	,	we	 requir 	 e 	 	a	certain	 work 	 force 	 	.
and	then	we	focused	on	village	 girl 	 s 	 	that	we	 recruit 	 ed 	 	,	and	then	they	 re 	 ally 	 	are	the	 back 	 bone 	 	of	the	 organ 	 ization 	 	.
they	do	 al 	 most 	 	all	of	the	skill	-	based	routine	 task 	 s 	 	.
they	do	one	thing	at	a	time	.	they	do	it	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	well	.
with	the	result	we	have	 ver 	 y 	 	high	 product 	 ivity 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	high	quality	at	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	low	cost	.
so	,	 put 	 ting 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	together	,	what	 re 	 ally 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	was	the	 product 	 ivity 	 	of	our	staff	was	 significant 	 ly 	 	 high 	 er 	 	than	 any 	 one 	 	else	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 bus 	 y 	 	table	,	but	what	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	is	 convey 	 ing 	 	is	that	,	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	quality	,	we	have	put	in	 ver 	 y 	 	good	quality	-	assurance	 system 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	result	,	our	 complic 	 ations 	 	are	 significant 	 ly 	 	lower	than	what	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 report 	 ed 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 king 	 dom 	 	,	and	you	do	n't	see	 t 	 hose 	 	kind	of	 number 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	often	.
so	the	final	part	of	the	 puzzl 	 e 	 	is	,	how	do	you	make	all	 th 	 is 	 	work	 financial 	 ly 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	when	the	people	ca	n't	pay	for	it	?
so	what	we	did	was	,	we	 g 	 ave 	 	away	a	lot	of	it	for	free	,	and	then	 t 	 hose 	 	who	pay	,	i	mean	,	they	paid	local	market	rates	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	more	,	and	often	much	less	.	and	we	 we 	 re 	 	 help 	 ed 	 	by	the	market	 in 	 efficiency 	 	.
i	think	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	big	savior	,	even	now	.
and	,	of	course	,	one	 need 	 s 	 	the	 mind 	 set 	 	to	be	 want 	 ing 	 	to	give	away	what	you	have	 a 	 s 	 	a	 sur 	 plus 	 	.
the	result	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	,	over	the	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	 expend 	 iture 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	with	 volume 	 s 	 	.
the	 revenue 	 s 	 	 in 	 crease 	 	at	a	 high 	 er 	 	level	,	giving	us	a	 health 	 y 	 	margin	while	you	're	 treat 	 ing 	 	a	large	number	of	people	for	free	.
i	think	in	absolute	 term 	 s 	 	,	last	year	we	 earn 	 ed 	 	about	20	-	odd	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 pent 	 	about	13	million	,	with	over	a	40	percent	ebita	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 requir 	 es 	 	going	beyond	what	we	do	,	or	what	we	have	 d 	 one 	 	,	if	you	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	solving	 th 	 is 	 	problem	of	 blind 	 ness 	 	.
and	what	we	did	was	a	couple	of	 ver 	 y 	 	counter	-	intuitive	 thing 	 s 	 	.
we	 create 	 d 	 	 com 	 petition 	 	for	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	and	then	we	made	eye	care	 afford 	 able 	 	by	making	low	-	cost	 consum 	 able 	 s 	 	.
we	 pro 	 active 	 ly 	 	and	 system 	 at 	 ically 	 	 promote 	 d 	 	these	 practice 	 s 	 	to	 man 	 y 	 	 hospital 	 s 	 	in	india	,	 man 	 y 	 	in	our	own	 back 	 yard 	 s 	 	and	then	in	other	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	world	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
the	impact	of	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	that	these	 hospital 	 s 	 	,	in	the	second	year	after	our	 consult 	 ation 	 	,	are	double	 the 	 ir 	 	 out 	 put 	 	and	then	 achiev 	 e 	 	financial	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
the	other	part	was	how	do	you	address	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 crease 	 	in	cost	of	technology	?
there	was	a	time	when	we	 fail 	 ed 	 	to	 negoti 	 ate 	 	the	[	intra	-	ocular	lens	]	 price 	 s 	 	to	be	at	 afford 	 able 	 	 level 	 s 	 	,	so	we	set	up	a	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	unit	.
and	then	,	over	time	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	 br 	 ing 	 	down	the	cost	 significant 	 ly 	 	to	about	two	percent	of	what	it	used	to	be	when	we	 start 	 ed 	 	out	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	we	 believ 	 e 	 	we	have	about	seven	percent	of	the	global	market	,	and	they	're	used	in	about	120	-	odd	 count 	 ries 	 	.
to	conclude	,	i	mean	,	what	we	do	,	 do 	 es 	 	it	have	a	 broad 	 er 	 	relevance	,	or	is	it	just	india	or	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	?
so	to	address	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	 stud 	 ied 	 	uk	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	aravind	.
what	it	 show 	 s 	 	is	that	we	do	 rough 	 ly 	 	about	60	percent	of	the	volume	of	what	the	uk	 do 	 es 	 	,	near	a	half	-	million	 s 	 urge 	 ries 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	whole	country	.
and	we	do	about	300,000	.
and	then	we	train	about	50	 ophthalmo 	 logists 	 	against	the	70	trained	by	them	,	 compar 	 able 	 	quality	,	both	in	training	and	in	patient	care	.
so	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 compar 	 ing 	 	 apple 	 s 	 	to	 apple 	 s 	 	.
we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	cost	.
so	,	i	think	it	is	simple	to	say	just	 be 	 cause 	 	the	u.k.	is	n't	india	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
i	think	there	is	more	to	it	.
i	mean	,	i	think	one	 ha 	 s 	 	to	look	at	other	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
 may 	 be 	 	there	is	--	the	solution	to	the	cost	could	be	in	 product 	 ivity 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	in	efficiency	,	in	the	 clinic 	 al 	 	process	,	or	in	how	much	they	pay	for	the	 lens 	 es 	 	or	 consum 	 able 	 s 	 	,	or	 regulat 	 ions 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	defensive	practice	.
so	,	i	think	 de 	 cod 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	can	 prob 	 ably 	 	 br 	 ing 	 	 answer 	 s 	 	to	most	 develop 	 ed 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	the	u.s.	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	obama	's	 rating 	 s 	 	can	go	up	 aga 	 in 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	 in 	 sight 	 	,	which	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	i	want	to	 leav 	 e 	 	with	you	,	in	 condition 	 s 	 	where	the	problem	is	 ver 	 y 	 	large	,	which	 cut 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	all	economic	 strat 	 a 	 	,	where	we	have	a	good	solution	,	i	think	the	process	i	 de 	 scribed 	 	,	you	know	,	 product 	 ivity 	 	,	quality	,	patient	-	 center 	 ed 	 	care	,	can	give	an	answer	,	and	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	which	fit	 th 	 is 	 	paradigm	.
you	take	 dent 	 ist 	 ry 	 	,	 hear 	 ing 	 	aid	,	 mat 	 ern 	 ity 	 	and	so	on	.
there	are	 man 	 y 	 	where	 th 	 is 	 	paradigm	can	now	play	,	but	i	think	 prob 	 ably 	 	one	of	the	most	 challeng 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	is	on	the	 soft 	 er 	 	side	.
now	,	how	do	you	create	 compass 	 ion 	 	?
now	,	how	do	you	make	people	own	the	problem	,	want	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	it	?
there	are	a	bit	 hard 	 er 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	people	in	 th 	 is 	 	crowd	can	 prob 	 ably 	 	find	the	 solution 	 s 	 	to	these	.
so	i	want	to	end	my	talk	 leav 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	thought	and	 challeng 	 e 	 	to	you	.
dr.	v	:	when	you	grow	in	spiritual	 conscious 	 ness 	 	,	we	identify	with	all	that	is	in	the	world	so	there	is	no	 exploit 	 ation 	 	.
it	is	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	we	are	 help 	 ing 	 	.
it	is	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	we	are	 heal 	 ing 	 	.
tr	:	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
