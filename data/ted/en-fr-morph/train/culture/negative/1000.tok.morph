i	have	a	 doppelg 	 anger 	 	.
dr.	gero	is	a	 brilli 	 ant 	 	but	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	mad	scientist	in	the	``	dragonball	z	:	android	 s 	 aga 	 	.	``
if	you	look	 ver 	 y 	 	 care 	 fully 	 	,	you	see	that	his	skull	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 replace 	 d 	 	with	a	 trans 	 parent 	 	plexiglas	 dom 	 e 	 	so	that	the	 work 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	his	brain	can	be	 observ 	 ed 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	controlled	with	light	.
that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	i	do	--	optical	mind	control	.
but	in	contrast	to	my	 e 	 vil 	 	 t 	 win 	 	who	 lust 	 s 	 	after	world	 domin 	 ation 	 	,	my	 motive 	 s 	 	are	not	 s 	 ini 	 ster 	 	.
i	control	the	brain	in	order	to	understand	how	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
now	wait	a	minute	,	you	may	say	,	how	can	you	go	straight	to	 controll 	 ing 	 	the	brain	 with 	 out 	 	 understand 	 ing 	 	it	first	?
is	n't	that	 put 	 ting 	 	the	cart	before	the	horse	?
 man 	 y 	 	 neuro 	 scientist 	 s 	 	agree	with	 th 	 is 	 	view	and	think	that	 understand 	 ing 	 	will	come	from	more	 detail 	 ed 	 	 observ 	 ation 	 	and	analysis	.
they	say	,	``	if	we	could	record	the	activity	of	our	 neuro 	 ns 	 	,	we	would	understand	the	brain	.	``
but	think	for	a	moment	what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	.
even	if	we	could	measure	what	every	cell	is	 do 	 ing 	 	at	all	 time 	 s 	 	,	we	would	still	have	to	make	sense	of	the	 record 	 ed 	 	activity	 pattern 	 s 	 	,	and	that	's	so	difficult	,	 chance 	 s 	 	are	we	'll	understand	these	 pattern 	 s 	 	just	 a 	 s 	 	little	 a 	 s 	 	the	 brain 	 s 	 	that	produce	them	.
take	a	look	at	what	brain	activity	might	look	like	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	 simul 	 ation 	 	,	each	black	dot	is	one	nerve	cell	.
the	dot	is	visible	 when 	 ever 	 	a	cell	 fire 	 s 	 	an	 electric 	 al 	 	impulse	.
there	's	10,000	 neuro 	 ns 	 	here	.
so	you	're	looking	at	 rough 	 ly 	 	one	percent	of	the	brain	of	a	 cock 	 roach 	 	.
your	 brain 	 s 	 	are	about	100	million	 time 	 s 	 	more	 complic 	 ated 	 	.
 some 	 where 	 	,	in	a	pattern	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	is	you	,	your	 per 	 ception 	 s 	 	,	your	 emotion 	 s 	 	,	your	 memor 	 ies 	 	,	your	 plan 	 s 	 	for	the	future	.
but	we	do	n't	know	where	,	since	we	do	n't	know	how	to	read	the	pattern	.
we	do	n't	understand	the	code	used	by	the	brain	.
to	make	progress	,	we	need	to	break	the	code	.
but	how	?
an	 experience 	 d 	 	code	-	breaker	will	tell	you	that	in	order	to	figure	out	what	the	 symbol 	 s 	 	in	a	code	mean	,	it	's	essential	to	be	able	to	play	with	them	,	to	 re 	 arrange 	 	them	at	will	.
so	in	 th 	 is 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	too	,	to	decode	the	information	 contain 	 ed 	 	in	 pattern 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	 watch 	 ing 	 	 al 	 one 	 	wo	n't	do	.	we	need	to	 re 	 arrange 	 	the	pattern	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 record 	 ing 	 	the	activity	of	 neuro 	 ns 	 	,	we	need	to	control	it	.
it	's	not	essential	that	we	can	control	the	activity	of	all	 neuro 	 ns 	 	in	the	brain	,	just	some	.
the	more	 target 	 ed 	 	our	 intervention 	 s 	 	,	the	better	.
and	i	'll	show	you	in	a	moment	how	we	can	 achiev 	 e 	 	the	 necess 	 ary 	 	 pre 	 cis 	 ion 	 	.
and	since	i	'm	realistic	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 grand 	 iose 	 	,	i	do	n't	claim	that	the	ability	to	control	the	function	of	the	nervous	system	will	at	once	unravel	all	 it 	 s 	 	 myster 	 ies 	 	.
but	we	'll	 certain 	 ly 	 	learn	a	lot	.
now	,	i	'm	by	no	 mean 	 s 	 	the	first	person	to	 real 	 ize 	 	how	 power 	 ful 	 	a	tool	intervention	is	.
the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 attempt 	 s 	 	to	tinker	with	the	function	of	the	nervous	system	is	long	and	 illustr 	 ious 	 	.
it	 date 	 s 	 	back	at	 l 	 east 	 	200	 year 	 s 	 	,	to	galvani	's	famous	 experiment 	 s 	 	in	the	late	18th	century	and	beyond	.
galvani	 show 	 ed 	 	that	a	frog	's	 leg 	 s 	 	 twitch 	 ed 	 	when	he	 connect 	 ed 	 	the	 lum 	 bar 	 	nerve	to	a	source	of	 electric 	 al 	 	current	.
 th 	 is 	 	experiment	 reveal 	 ed 	 	the	first	,	and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	most	fundamental	,	nugget	of	the	neural	code	:	that	information	is	written	in	the	form	of	 electric 	 al 	 	 impulse 	 s 	 	.
galvani	's	approach	of	 prob 	 ing 	 	the	nervous	system	with	 electro 	 de 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 remain 	 ed 	 	state	-	of	-	the	-	art	 un 	 til 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	 de 	 spite 	 	a	number	of	 draw 	 back 	 s 	 	.
 stick 	 ing 	 	 wire 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	brain	is	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	 crud 	 e 	 	.
it	's	hard	to	do	in	 animal 	 s 	 	that	run	around	,	and	there	is	a	physical	limit	to	the	number	of	 wire 	 s 	 	that	can	be	 insert 	 ed 	 	 simultaneous 	 ly 	 	.
so	around	the	turn	of	the	last	century	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	think	,	``	would	n't	it	be	 wonder 	 ful 	 	if	one	could	take	 th 	 is 	 	logic	and	turn	it	 up 	 side 	 	down	?	``
so	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 insert 	 ing 	 	a	wire	 in 	 to 	 	one	spot	of	the	brain	,	re	-	engineer	the	brain	 it 	 self 	 	so	that	some	of	 it 	 s 	 	neural	 element 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 respons 	 ive 	 	to	 diffuse 	 ly 	 	 broad 	 cast 	 	 signal 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	flash	of	light	.
 s 	 uch 	 	an	approach	would	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	in	a	flash	of	light	,	 over 	 come 	 	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 obstacle 	 s 	 	to	 discover 	 y 	 	.
first	,	it	's	 clear 	 ly 	 	a	non	-	invasive	,	 wire 	 less 	 	form	of	communication	.
and	second	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	in	a	radio	 broad 	 cast 	 	,	you	can	communicate	with	 man 	 y 	 	 receiv 	 ers 	 	at	once	.
you	do	n't	need	to	know	where	these	 receiv 	 ers 	 	are	,
and	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	if	these	 receiv 	 ers 	 	move	--	just	think	of	the	stereo	in	your	car	.
it	 get 	 s 	 	even	better	,	for	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	we	can	 fabric 	 ate 	 	the	 receiv 	 ers 	 	out	of	 material 	 s 	 	that	are	 encode 	 d 	 	in	dna	.
so	each	nerve	cell	with	the	right	genetic	 make 	 up 	 	will	 spontane 	 ously 	 	produce	a	 receiv 	 er 	 	that	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	control	 it 	 s 	 	function	.
i	hope	you	'll	appreciate	the	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 simpl 	 icity 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 cept 	 	.
there	's	no	high	-	tech	 gizmo 	 s 	 	here	,	just	biology	 reveal 	 ed 	 	through	biology	.
now	let	's	take	a	look	at	these	 miracul 	 ous 	 	 receiv 	 ers 	 	up	close	.
 a 	 s 	 	we	zoom	in	on	one	of	these	 pur 	 ple 	 	 neuro 	 ns 	 	,	we	see	that	 it 	 s 	 	 out 	 er 	 	membrane	is	 stud 	 d 	 ed 	 	with	 micro 	 scopic 	 	 pore 	 s 	 	.
 pore 	 s 	 	like	these	conduct	 electric 	 al 	 	current	and	are	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	all	the	communication	in	the	nervous	system	.
but	these	 pore 	 s 	 	here	are	special	.
they	are	 couple 	 d 	 	to	light	 receptor 	 s 	 	similar	to	the	 one 	 s 	 	in	your	 eye 	 s 	 	.
 when 	 ever 	 	a	flash	of	light	 hit 	 s 	 	the	receptor	,	the	pore	 open 	 s 	 	,	an	 electric 	 al 	 	current	is	 s 	 witch 	 ed 	 	on	,	and	the	 neuro 	 n 	 	 fire 	 s 	 	 electric 	 al 	 	 impulse 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	light	-	 activate 	 d 	 	pore	is	 encode 	 d 	 	in	dna	,	we	can	 achiev 	 e 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	 pre 	 cis 	 ion 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	each	cell	in	our	bodies	 contain 	 s 	 	the	same	set	of	 gene 	 s 	 	,	different	 mix 	 es 	 	of	 gene 	 s 	 	get	 turn 	 ed 	 	on	and	off	in	different	 cell 	 s 	 	.
you	can	exploit	 th 	 is 	 	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	 on 	 ly 	 	some	 neuro 	 ns 	 	contain	our	light	-	 activate 	 d 	 	pore	and	 other 	 s 	 	do	n't	.
so	in	 th 	 is 	 	cartoon	,	the	 blu 	 ish 	 	white	cell	in	the	upper	-	left	corner	 do 	 es 	 	not	respond	to	light	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 lack 	 s 	 	the	light	-	 activate 	 d 	 	pore	.
the	approach	 work 	 s 	 	so	well	that	we	can	write	 pur 	 e 	 ly 	 	artificial	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	 direct 	 ly 	 	to	the	brain	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	each	 electric 	 al 	 	impulse	,	each	 deflect 	 ion 	 	on	the	trace	,	is	 caus 	 ed 	 	by	a	brief	 puls 	 e 	 	of	light	.
and	the	approach	,	of	course	,	 al 	 so 	 	 work 	 s 	 	in	moving	,	 behav 	 ing 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	ever	 s 	 uch 	 	experiment	,	sort	of	the	optical	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	galvani	's	.
it	was	 d 	 one 	 	six	or	seven	 year 	 s 	 	ago	by	my	then	graduate	student	,	susana	 lim 	 a 	 	.
susana	had	engineered	the	fruit	fly	on	the	left	so	that	just	two	out	of	the	200,000	 cell 	 s 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	brain	 express 	 ed 	 	the	light	-	 activate 	 d 	 	pore	.
you	're	familiar	with	these	 cell 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	 frust 	 rate 	 	you	when	you	try	to	swat	the	fly	.
they	trained	the	 es 	 cape 	 	 re 	 flex 	 	that	 make 	 s 	 	the	fly	jump	 in 	 to 	 	the	air
and	fly	away	 when 	 ever 	 	you	move	your	hand	in	position	.
and	you	can	see	here	that	the	flash	of	light	 ha 	 s 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	effect	.
the	animal	 jump 	 s 	 	,	it	 spread 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 wing 	 s 	 	,	it	 vib 	 rates 	 	them	,	but	it	ca	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	take	off	 be 	 cause 	 	the	fly	is	 sandwich 	 ed 	 	between	two	glass	 plate 	 s 	 	.
now	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	no	 re 	 action 	 	of	the	fly	to	a	flash	it	could	see	,	susana	did	a	simple	but	 brutal 	 ly 	 	effective	experiment	.
she	cut	the	 head 	 s 	 	off	of	her	flies	.
these	 head 	 less 	 	bodies	can	live	for	about	a	day	,	but	they	do	n't	do	much	.
they	just	stand	around	and	groom	 excess 	 ively 	 	.
so	it	 seem 	 s 	 	that	the	 on 	 ly 	 	trait	that	 surviv 	 es 	 	 de 	 capita 	 tion 	 	is	 van 	 ity 	 	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	'll	see	in	a	moment	,	susana	was	able	to	turn	on	the	flight	motor	of	what	's	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	the	 spin 	 al 	 	cord	of	these	flies	and	get	some	of	the	 head 	 less 	 	bodies	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	take	off	and	fly	away	.
they	did	n't	get	 ver 	 y 	 	far	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	.
since	we	took	these	first	 step 	 s 	 	,	the	field	of	 op 	 to 	 genetic 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 explode 	 d 	 	.
and	there	are	now	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 lab 	 s 	 	using	these	 approach 	 es 	 	.
and	we	've	come	a	long	way	since	galvani	's	and	susana	's	first	 success 	 es 	 	in	making	 animal 	 s 	 	twitch	or	jump	.
we	can	now	 actual 	 ly 	 	interfere	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 psycho 	 logy 	 	in	 ra 	 ther 	 	 pro 	 found 	 	ways	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	'll	show	you	in	my	last	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	which	is	 direct 	 ed 	 	at	a	familiar	question	.
life	is	a	string	of	 choice 	 s 	 	creating	a	constant	pressure	to	decide	what	to	do	next	.
we	cope	with	 th 	 is 	 	pressure	by	 hav 	 ing 	 	 brain 	 s 	 	,	and	 with 	 in 	 	our	 brain 	 s 	 	,	decision	-	making	 center 	 s 	 	that	i	've	 call 	 ed 	 	here	the	``	 a 	 ctor 	 	.	``
the	 a 	 ctor 	 	 implement 	 s 	 	a	policy	that	 take 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	account	the	state	of	the	environment	and	the	 con 	 text 	 	in	which	we	 oper 	 ate 	 	.
our	 action 	 s 	 	change	the	environment	,	or	 con 	 text 	 	,	and	these	 change 	 s 	 	are	then	fed	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	decision	loop	.
now	to	put	some	 neuro 	 bio 	 logical 	 	meat	on	 th 	 is 	 	abstract	model	,	we	 construct 	 ed 	 	a	simple	one	-	dimensional	world	for	our	 favor 	 ite 	 	subject	,	fruit	flies	.
each	chamber	in	these	two	 vert 	 ical 	 	 stack 	 s 	 	 contain 	 s 	 	one	fly	.
the	left	and	the	right	 halv 	 es 	 	of	the	chamber	are	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	two	different	 odor 	 s 	 	,	and	a	security	camera	 watch 	 es 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	flies	pace	up	and	down	between	them	.
here	's	some	 s 	 uch 	 	cctv	 foot 	 age 	 	.
 when 	 ever 	 	a	fly	 reach 	 es 	 	the	 mid 	 point 	 	of	the	chamber	where	the	two	odor	 stream 	 s 	 	meet	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	make	a	decision	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	decide	 whet 	 her 	 	to	turn	around	and	stay	in	the	same	odor	,	or	 whet 	 her 	 	to	cross	the	 mid 	 line 	 	and	try	 some 	 thing 	 	new	.
these	 decision 	 s 	 	are	 clear 	 ly 	 	a	 reflect 	 ion 	 	of	the	 a 	 ctor 	 	's	policy	.
now	for	an	intelligent	 be 	 ing 	 	like	our	fly	,	 th 	 is 	 	policy	is	not	written	in	stone	but	 ra 	 ther 	 	 change 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	animal	 learn 	 s 	 	from	experience	.
we	can	 in 	 corporate 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	an	element	of	 adapt 	 ive 	 	 intellig 	 ence 	 	 in 	 to 	 	our	model	by	 assum 	 ing 	 	that	the	fly	's	brain	 contain 	 s 	 	not	 on 	 ly 	 	an	 a 	 ctor 	 	,	but	a	different	group	of	 cell 	 s 	 	,	a	``	critic	,	``	that	 provide 	 s 	 	a	running	 comment 	 ary 	 	on	the	 a 	 ctor 	 	's	 choice 	 s 	 	.
you	can	think	of	 th 	 is 	 	 nag 	 ging 	 	inner	voice	 a 	 s 	 	sort	of	the	brain	's	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	the	catholic	church	,	if	you	're	an	austrian	like	me	,	or	the	super	-	ego	,	if	you	're	freudian	,	or	your	mother	,	if	you	're	jewish	.
now	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	the	critic	is	a	key	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 	in	what	 make 	 s 	 	us	intelligent	.
so	we	set	out	to	identify	the	 cell 	 s 	 	in	the	fly	's	brain	that	 play 	 ed 	 	the	role	of	the	critic	.
and	the	logic	of	our	experiment	was	simple	.
we	thought	if	we	could	use	our	optical	remote	control	to	activate	the	 cell 	 s 	 	of	the	critic	,	we	should	be	able	,	 artificial 	 ly 	 	,	to	nag	the	 a 	 ctor 	 	 in 	 to 	 	changing	 it 	 s 	 	policy	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	the	fly	should	learn	from	 mistak 	 es 	 	that	it	thought	it	had	made	but	,	in	 re 	 ality 	 	,	it	had	not	made	.
so	we	 br 	 ed 	 	flies	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 brain 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	more	or	less	 random 	 ly 	 	 pepper 	 ed 	 	with	 cell 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	light	 address 	 able 	 	.
and	then	we	took	these	flies	and	 allow 	 ed 	 	them	to	make	 choice 	 s 	 	.
and	 when 	 ever 	 	they	made	one	of	the	two	 choice 	 s 	 	,	chose	one	odor	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	the	blue	one	over	the	 o 	 range 	 	one	,	we	 s 	 witch 	 ed 	 	on	the	 light 	 s 	 	.
if	the	critic	was	among	the	 optical 	 ly 	 	 activate 	 d 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	,	the	result	of	 th 	 is 	 	intervention	should	be	a	change	in	policy	.
the	fly	should	learn	to	avoid	the	 optical 	 ly 	 	 reinforce 	 d 	 	odor	.
here	's	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	two	 in 	 stance 	 s 	 	:
we	're	 compar 	 ing 	 	two	 s 	 train 	 s 	 	of	flies	,	each	of	them	 hav 	 ing 	 	about	100	light	-	 address 	 able 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 brain 	 s 	 	,	 show 	 n 	 	here	in	green	on	the	left	and	on	the	right	.
what	's	common	among	these	 group 	 s 	 	of	 cell 	 s 	 	is	that	they	all	produce	the	 neuro 	 transmit 	 ter 	 	dopamine	.
but	the	 ident 	 ities 	 	of	the	individual	dopamine	-	producing	 neuro 	 ns 	 	are	 clear 	 ly 	 	 large 	 ly 	 	different	on	the	left	and	on	the	right	.
 optical 	 ly 	 	 activ 	 ating 	 	these	hundred	or	so	 cell 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	two	 s 	 train 	 s 	 	of	flies	 ha 	 s 	 	 dramat 	 ically 	 	different	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	.
if	you	look	first	at	the	behavior	of	the	fly	on	the	right	,	you	can	see	that	 when 	 ever 	 	it	 reach 	 es 	 	the	 mid 	 point 	 	of	the	chamber	where	the	two	 odor 	 s 	 	meet	,	it	 march 	 es 	 	straight	through	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	did	before	.
 it 	 s 	 	behavior	is	 complete 	 ly 	 	 un 	 change 	 d 	 	.
but	the	behavior	of	the	fly	on	the	left	is	 ver 	 y 	 	different	.
 when 	 ever 	 	it	 come 	 s 	 	up	to	the	 mid 	 point 	 	,	it	 pause 	 s 	 	,	it	 care 	 fully 	 	 s 	 can 	 s 	 	the	odor	 inter 	 face 	 	 a 	 s 	 	if	it	was	 sniff 	 ing 	 	out	 it 	 s 	 	environment	,	and	then	it	 turn 	 s 	 	around	.
 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	the	policy	that	the	 a 	 ctor 	 	 implement 	 s 	 	now	 include 	 s 	 	an	 instruct 	 ion 	 	to	avoid	the	odor	that	's	in	the	right	half	of	the	chamber	.
 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	the	critic	must	have	spoken	in	that	animal	,	and	that	the	critic	must	be	 contain 	 ed 	 	among	the	dopamine	-	producing	 neuro 	 ns 	 	on	the	left	,	but	not	among	the	dopamine	producing	 neuro 	 ns 	 	on	the	right	.
through	 man 	 y 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	narrow	down	the	 ident 	 ity 	 	of	the	critic	to	just	12	 cell 	 s 	 	.
these	12	 cell 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 show 	 n 	 	here	in	green	,	 s 	 end 	 	the	 out 	 put 	 	to	a	brain	structure	 call 	 ed 	 	the	``	mushroom	body	,	``	which	is	 show 	 n 	 	here	in	gray	.
we	know	from	our	 form 	 al 	 	model	that	the	brain	structure	at	the	 receiv 	 ing 	 	end	of	the	critic	's	 comment 	 ary 	 	is	the	 a 	 ctor 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	anatomy	 suggest 	 s 	 	that	the	mushroom	bodies	have	 some 	 thing 	 	to	do	with	action	choice	.
based	on	 every 	 thing 	 	we	know	about	the	mushroom	bodies	,	 th 	 is 	 	 make 	 s 	 	perfect	sense	.
in	fact	,	it	 make 	 s 	 	so	much	sense	that	we	can	construct	an	 electron 	 ic 	 	 to 	 y 	 	circuit	that	 simul 	 ates 	 	the	behavior	of	the	fly	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	 electron 	 ic 	 	 to 	 y 	 	circuit	,	the	mushroom	body	 neuro 	 ns 	 	are	 symbol 	 ized 	 	by	the	 vert 	 ical 	 	bank	of	blue	leds	in	the	center	of	the	board	.
these	led	's	are	wired	to	 sensor 	 s 	 	that	detect	the	presence	of	 odor 	 ous 	 	 molecule 	 s 	 	in	the	air	.
each	odor	 activate 	 s 	 	a	different	combination	of	 sensor 	 s 	 	,	which	in	turn	 activate 	 s 	 	a	different	odor	 detect 	 or 	 	in	the	mushroom	body	.
so	the	pilot	in	the	 cock 	 pit 	 	of	the	fly	,	the	 a 	 ctor 	 	,	can	tell	which	odor	is	present	 simpl 	 y 	 	by	looking	at	which	of	the	blue	leds	 light 	 s 	 	up	.
what	the	 a 	 ctor 	 	 do 	 es 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	information	 depend 	 s 	 	on	 it 	 s 	 	policy	,	which	is	 store 	 d 	 	in	the	 strength 	 s 	 	of	the	 connect 	 ion 	 	,	between	the	odor	 detect 	 ors 	 	and	the	 motor 	 s 	 	that	power	the	fly	's	 evas 	 ive 	 	 action 	 s 	 	.
if	the	 connect 	 ion 	 	is	weak	,	the	 motor 	 s 	 	will	stay	off	and	the	fly	will	 continu 	 e 	 	straight	on	 it 	 s 	 	course	.
if	the	 connect 	 ion 	 	is	strong	,	the	 motor 	 s 	 	will	turn	on	and	the	fly	will	 initi 	 ate 	 	a	turn	.
now	consider	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	in	which	the	 motor 	 s 	 	stay	off	,	the	fly	 continu 	 es 	 	on	 it 	 s 	 	path	and	it	 suffer 	 s 	 	some	 pain 	 ful 	 	 con 	 sequence 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 zap 	 ped 	 	.
in	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	would	expect	the	critic	to	speak	up	and	to	tell	the	 a 	 ctor 	 	to	change	 it 	 s 	 	policy	.
we	have	 create 	 d 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	 artificial 	 ly 	 	,	by	 turn 	 ing 	 	on	the	critic	with	a	flash	of	light	.
that	 caus 	 ed 	 	a	 strength 	 en 	 ing 	 	of	the	 connect 	 ions 	 	between	the	 current 	 ly 	 	active	odor	 detect 	 or 	 	and	the	 motor 	 s 	 	.
so	the	next	time	the	fly	 find 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	facing	the	same	odor	 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	 connect 	 ion 	 	is	strong	 en 	 ough 	 	to	turn	on	the	 motor 	 s 	 	and	to	trigger	an	 evas 	 ive 	 	maneuver	.
i	do	n't	know	about	you	,	but	i	find	it	 exhila 	 rating 	 	to	see	how	vague	 psycho 	 logical 	 	 not 	 ions 	 	 evapo 	 rate 	 	and	give	rise	to	a	physical	,	 mechan 	 istic 	 	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	the	mind	,	even	if	it	's	the	mind	of	the	fly	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	piece	of	good	news	.
the	other	piece	of	good	news	,	for	a	scientist	at	 l 	 east 	 	,	is	that	much	 remain 	 s 	 	to	be	 discover 	 ed 	 	.
in	the	 experiment 	 s 	 	i	told	you	about	,	we	have	 lift 	 ed 	 	the	 ident 	 ity 	 	of	the	critic	,	but	we	still	have	no	idea	how	the	critic	 do 	 es 	 	 it 	 s 	 	job	.
come	to	think	of	it	,	 know 	 ing 	 	when	you	're	wrong	 with 	 out 	 	a	teacher	,	or	your	mother	,	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	,	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	problem	.
there	are	some	 idea 	 s 	 	in	computer	science	and	in	artificial	 intellig 	 ence 	 	 a 	 s 	 	to	how	 th 	 is 	 	might	be	 d 	 one 	 	,	but	we	still	have	n't	 solve 	 d 	 	a	single	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	how	intelligent	behavior	 spring 	 s 	 	from	the	physical	 interact 	 ions 	 	in	living	matter	.
i	think	we	'll	get	there	in	the	not	too	 di 	 stant 	 	future	.
thank	you	.
