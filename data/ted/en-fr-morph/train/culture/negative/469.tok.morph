i	'm	here	 to 	 day 	 	 represent 	 ing 	 	a	team	of	 artist 	 s 	 	and	 techno 	 logists 	 	and	 film 	 makers 	 	that	 work 	 ed 	 	together	on	a	 remark 	 able 	 	film	project	for	the	last	four	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	 a 	 long 	 	the	way	they	 create 	 d 	 	a	 break 	 through 	 	in	computer	 visual 	 ization 	 	.
so	i	want	to	show	you	a	clip	of	the	film	now	.
 hope 	 fully 	 	it	wo	n't	 st 	 utter 	 	.
and	if	we	did	our	 job 	 s 	 	well	,	you	wo	n't	know	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	even	 involve 	 d 	 	.
voice	:	i	do	n't	know	how	it	's	possible	...
but	you	seem	to	have	more	hair	.
brad	pitt	:	what	if	i	told	you	that	i	was	n't	 get 	 ting 	 	 old 	 er 	 	...
but	i	was	 get 	 ting 	 	 young 	 er 	 	than	 every 	 body 	 	else	?
i	was	born	with	some	form	of	disease	.
voice	:	what	kind	of	disease	?
bp	:	i	was	born	old	.
man	:	i	'm	sorry	.
bp	:	no	need	to	be	.	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	wrong	with	old	age	.
girl	:	are	you	sick	?
bp	:	i	heard	 mom 	 ma 	 	and	tizzy	whisper	,	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	i	was	gon	na	die	soon	.
but	...	 may 	 be 	 	not	.
girl	:	you	're	different	than	 any 	 body 	 	i	've	ever	met	.
bb	:	there	 we 	 re 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 change 	 s 	 	...
some	you	could	see	,	some	you	could	n't	.
hair	 start 	 ed 	 	growing	in	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 place 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 long 	 	with	other	 thing 	 s 	 	.
i	felt	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	,	 consider 	 ing 	 	.
ed	ulbrich	:	that	was	a	clip	from	``	the	 cur 	 ious 	 	case	of	benjamin	button	.	``
 man 	 y 	 	of	you	,	 may 	 be 	 	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	it	or	you	've	heard	of	the	story	,	but	what	you	might	not	know	is	that	for	 near 	 ly 	 	the	first	hour	of	the	film	,	the	main	character	,	benjamin	button	,	who	's	 play 	 ed 	 	by	brad	pitt	,	is	 complete 	 ly 	 	computer	-	generated	from	the	neck	up	.
now	,	there	's	no	use	of	 prost 	 hetic 	 	 make 	 up 	 	or	 photograph 	 y 	 	of	brad	 super 	 impose 	 d 	 	over	 an 	 other 	 	 a 	 ctor 	 	's	body	.
we	've	 create 	 d 	 	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	digital	human	head	.
so	i	'd	like	to	start	with	a	little	bit	of	 histo 	 ry 	 	on	the	project	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	based	on	an	f.	scott	fitzgerald	short	story	.
it	's	about	a	man	who	's	born	old	and	 live 	 s 	 	his	life	in	reverse	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	movie	 ha 	 s 	 	 float 	 ed 	 	around	hollywood	for	well	over	half	a	century	,	and	we	first	got	 involve 	 d 	 	with	the	project	in	the	early	'90s	,	with	ron	howard	 a 	 s 	 	the	director	.
we	took	a	lot	of	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	we	 serious 	 ly 	 	 consider 	 ed 	 	it	.
but	at	the	time	we	had	to	throw	in	the	 to 	 wel 	 	.
it	was	 de 	 em 	 ed 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	.
it	was	beyond	the	technology	of	the	day	to	depict	a	man	aging	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	.
the	human	form	,	in	 part 	 icular 	 	the	human	head	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 consider 	 ed 	 	the	holy	 g 	 rail 	 	of	our	industry	.
the	project	came	back	to	us	about	a	decade	 lat 	 er 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	time	with	a	director	named	david	fincher	.
now	,	fincher	is	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	guy	.
david	is	 fear 	 less 	 	of	technology	,	and	he	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 ten 	 acious 	 	.
and	david	wo	n't	take	``	no.	``
and	david	 believ 	 ed 	 	,	like	we	do	in	the	visual	 effect 	 s 	 	industry	,	that	 any 	 thing 	 	is	possible	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	you	have	 en 	 ough 	 	time	,	 resource 	 s 	 	and	,	of	course	,	money	.
and	so	david	had	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	take	on	the	film	,	and	he	threw	a	 challeng 	 e 	 	at	us	.
he	 want 	 ed 	 	the	main	character	of	the	film	to	be	 play 	 ed 	 	from	the	cradle	to	the	grave	by	one	 a 	 ctor 	 	.
it	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	be	 th 	 is 	 	guy	.
we	went	through	a	process	of	 elimi 	 nation 	 	and	a	process	of	 discover 	 y 	 	with	david	,	and	we	 rul 	 ed 	 	out	,	of	course	,	 swap 	 ping 	 	 act 	 ors 	 	.
that	was	one	idea	:	that	we	would	have	different	 act 	 ors 	 	,	and	we	would	hand	off	from	 a 	 ctor 	 	to	 a 	 ctor 	 	.
we	even	 rul 	 ed 	 	out	the	idea	of	using	 make 	 up 	 	.
we	 real 	 ized 	 	that	 prost 	 hetic 	 	 make 	 up 	 	just	would	n't	hold	up	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	in	close	-	up	.
and	 make 	 up 	 	is	an	additive	process	.	you	have	to	build	the	face	up	.
and	david	 want 	 ed 	 	to	carve	 deep 	 ly 	 	 in 	 to 	 	brad	's	face	to	 br 	 ing 	 	the	aging	to	 th 	 is 	 	character	.
he	 need 	 ed 	 	to	be	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 sym 	 pathetic 	 	character	.
so	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	cast	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	little	people	that	would	play	the	different	bodies	of	benjamin	at	the	different	 increment 	 s 	 	of	his	life	and	that	we	would	in	fact	create	a	computer	-	generated	version	of	brad	's	head	,	aged	to	appear	 a 	 s 	 	benjamin	,	and	attach	that	to	the	body	of	the	real	 a 	 ctor 	 	.
 sound 	 ed 	 	great	.
of	course	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	holy	 g 	 rail 	 	of	our	industry	,	and	the	fact	that	 th 	 is 	 	guy	is	a	global	icon	did	n't	help	either	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	if	any	of	you	ever	stand	in	line	at	the	 grocer 	 y 	 	store	,	you	know	--	we	see	his	face	 constant 	 ly 	 	.
so	there	 re 	 ally 	 	was	no	 toler 	 able 	 	margin	of	error	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	two	 studio 	 s 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	:	warner	 brother 	 s 	 	and	 para 	 mount 	 	.
and	they	both	 believ 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	would	make	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	film	,	of	course	,	but	it	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	high	-	risk	 pro 	 position 	 	.
there	was	 lot 	 s 	 	of	money	and	 reputation 	 s 	 	at	 s 	 take 	 	.
but	we	 believ 	 ed 	 	that	we	had	a	 ver 	 y 	 	solid	 method 	 ology 	 	that	might	work	...
but	 de 	 spite 	 	our	verbal	 assurance 	 s 	 	,	they	 want 	 ed 	 	some	proof	.
and	so	,	in	2004	,	they	 commission 	 ed 	 	us	to	do	a	screen	test	of	benjamin	.
and	we	did	it	in	about	five	 week 	 s 	 	.
but	we	used	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 cheat 	 s 	 	and	 short 	 cut 	 s 	 	.	we	 bas 	 ically 	 	put	 some 	 thing 	 	together	to	get	through	the	 meet 	 ing 	 	.
i	'll	roll	that	for	you	now	.	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	first	test	for	benjamin	button	.
and	in	here	,	you	can	see	,	that	's	a	computer	-	generated	head	--	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	--	 attach 	 ed 	 	to	the	body	of	an	 a 	 ctor 	 	.
and	it	 work 	 ed 	 	.	and	it	 g 	 ave 	 	the	studio	great	relief	.
after	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	of	 start 	 s 	 	and	 stop 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	project	,	and	making	that	tough	decision	,	they	 final 	 ly 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	to	 green 	 light 	 	the	movie	.
and	i	can	remember	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	when	i	got	the	phone	call	to	 congratula 	 te 	 	us	,	to	say	the	movie	was	a	go	,	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	threw	up	.
you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	some	tough	stuff	.
so	we	 start 	 ed 	 	to	have	early	team	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	and	we	got	 every 	 body 	 	together	,	and	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	more	like	therapy	in	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	convincing	each	other	and	 re 	 assur 	 ing 	 	each	other	that	we	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	 under 	 take 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
we	had	to	hold	up	an	hour	of	a	movie	with	a	character	.
and	it	's	not	a	special	 effect 	 s 	 	film	;	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	a	man	.
we	 re 	 ally 	 	felt	like	we	 we 	 re 	 	in	a	--	kind	of	a	12	-	step	program	.
and	of	course	,	the	first	step	is	:	admit	you	've	got	a	problem	.
so	we	had	a	big	problem	:
we	did	n't	know	how	we	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	we	did	know	one	thing	.
 be 	 ing 	 	from	the	visual	 effect 	 s 	 	industry	,	we	,	with	david	,	 believ 	 ed 	 	that	we	now	had	 en 	 ough 	 	time	,	 en 	 ough 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	,	and	,	god	,	we	 hop 	 ed 	 	we	had	 en 	 ough 	 	money	.
and	we	had	 en 	 ough 	 	 pass 	 ion 	 	to	will	the	 process 	 es 	 	and	technology	 in 	 to 	 	 exist 	 ence 	 	.
so	,	when	you	're	 face 	 d 	 	with	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	,	of	course	you	've	got	to	break	it	down	.
you	take	the	big	problem	and	you	break	it	down	 in 	 to 	 	 small 	 er 	 	 piece 	 s 	 	and	you	start	to	attack	that	.
so	we	had	three	main	 area 	 s 	 	that	we	had	to	focus	on	.
we	 need 	 ed 	 	to	make	brad	look	a	lot	 old 	 er 	 	--
 need 	 ed 	 	to	age	him	45	 year 	 s 	 	or	so	.
and	we	 al 	 so 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	we	could	take	brad	's	 idio 	 sync 	 ra 	 s 	 ies 	 	,	his	little	tics	,	the	little	 subtle 	 ties 	 	that	make	him	who	he	is	and	have	that	 transl 	 ate 	 	through	our	process	so	that	it	 appear 	 s 	 	in	benjamin	on	the	screen	.
and	we	 al 	 so 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	to	create	a	character	that	could	hold	up	under	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	all	 condition 	 s 	 	.
he	 need 	 ed 	 	to	be	able	to	walk	in	broad	 day 	 light 	 	,	at	 night 	 time 	 	,	under	 candle 	 light 	 	,	he	had	to	hold	an	 extrem 	 e 	 	close	-	up	,	he	had	to	deliver	 dial 	 ogue 	 	,
he	had	to	be	able	to	take	a	bath	,	to	cry	,	he	even	had	to	throw	up	.
not	all	at	the	same	time	--	but	he	had	to	,	you	know	,	do	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	the	work	had	to	hold	up	for	 al 	 most 	 	the	first	hour	of	the	movie	.
we	did	about	325	 shot 	 s 	 	.
so	we	 need 	 ed 	 	a	system	that	would	allow	benjamin	to	do	 every 	 thing 	 	a	human	 be 	 ing 	 	can	do	.
and	we	 real 	 ized 	 	that	there	was	a	giant	 cha 	 sm 	 	between	the	state	of	the	art	of	technology	in	2004	and	where	we	 need 	 ed 	 	it	to	be	.
so	we	focused	on	motion	capture	.
i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	have	 s 	 een 	 	motion	capture	.
the	state	of	the	art	at	the	time	was	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	marker	-	based	motion	capture	.
i	'll	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	here	.
it	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	the	idea	of	,	you	wear	a	 le 	 ot 	 ard 	 	,	and	they	put	some	 reflect 	 ive 	 	 marker 	 s 	 	on	your	body	,	and	 in 	 stead 	 	of	using	 camera 	 s 	 	,	there	're	 infra 	 red 	 	 sensor 	 s 	 	around	a	volume	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	 infra 	 red 	 	 sensor 	 s 	 	track	the	three	-	dimensional	position	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 marker 	 s 	 	in	real	time	.
and	then	 anim 	 ators 	 	can	take	the	data	of	the	motion	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 marker 	 s 	 	and	 app 	 ly 	 	them	to	a	computer	-	generated	character	.
you	can	see	the	computer	 character 	 s 	 	on	the	right	are	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	same	complex	motion	 a 	 s 	 	the	 danc 	 ers 	 	.
but	we	 al 	 so 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 number 	 s 	 	of	other	 film 	 s 	 	at	the	time	that	 we 	 re 	 	using	 fa 	 cial 	 	marker	 track 	 ing 	 	,	and	that	's	the	idea	of	 put 	 ting 	 	 marker 	 s 	 	on	the	human	face	and	 do 	 ing 	 	the	same	process	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	it	 give 	 s 	 	you	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	 crap 	 py 	 	performance	.
that	's	not	 terr 	 ibly 	 	 compel 	 ling 	 	.
and	what	we	 real 	 ized 	 	was	that	what	we	 need 	 ed 	 	was	the	information	that	was	going	on	between	the	 marker 	 s 	 	.
we	 need 	 ed 	 	the	 subtle 	 ties 	 	of	the	skin	.
we	 need 	 ed 	 	to	see	skin	moving	over	muscle	moving	over	bone	.
we	 need 	 ed 	 	 crease 	 s 	 	and	 d 	 imp 	 les 	 	and	 wrinkl 	 es 	 	and	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
our	first	 revel 	 ation 	 	was	to	 complete 	 ly 	 	abort	and	walk	away	from	the	technology	of	the	day	,	the	 stat 	 us 	 	quo	,	the	state	of	the	art	.
so	we	 abort 	 ed 	 	using	motion	capture	.
and	we	 we 	 re 	 	now	well	out	of	our	comfort	zone	,	and	in	 un 	 chart 	 ed 	 	 territ 	 ory 	 	.
so	we	 we 	 re 	 	left	with	 th 	 is 	 	idea	that	we	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 call 	 ing 	 	``	technology	stew	.	``
we	 start 	 ed 	 	to	look	out	in	other	 field 	 s 	 	.	the	idea	was	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	find	 nugget 	 s 	 	or	 gem 	 s 	 	of	technology	that	come	from	other	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	like	medical	 im 	 aging 	 	,	the	video	game	space	,	and	re	-	appropriate	them	.
and	we	had	to	create	kind	of	a	sauce	.
and	the	sauce	was	code	in	 soft 	 ware 	 	that	we	'd	written	to	allow	these	disparate	 piece 	 s 	 	of	technology	to	come	together	and	work	 a 	 s 	 	one	.
 initi 	 ally 	 	,	we	came	 a 	 cross 	 	some	 remark 	 able 	 	research	 d 	 one 	 	by	a	 gentle 	 man 	 	named	dr.	paul	ekman	in	the	early	'70s	.
he	 believ 	 ed 	 	that	he	could	,	in	fact	,	catalog	the	human	face	.
and	he	came	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	 fa 	 cial 	 	action	 cod 	 ing 	 	system	,	or	facs	.
he	 believ 	 ed 	 	that	there	 we 	 re 	 	70	 bas 	 ic 	 	 pose 	 s 	 	or	 shape 	 s 	 	of	the	human	face	,	and	that	 t 	 hose 	 	 bas 	 ic 	 	 pose 	 s 	 	or	 shape 	 s 	 	of	the	face	can	be	 combine 	 d 	 	to	create	infinite	 possibil 	 ities 	 	of	 every 	 thing 	 	the	human	face	is	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 do 	 ing 	 	.
and	of	course	,	these	transcend	age	,	race	,	culture	,	gender	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 came 	 	the	 found 	 ation 	 	of	our	research	 a 	 s 	 	we	went	forward	.
and	then	we	came	 a 	 cross 	 	some	 remark 	 able 	 	technology	 call 	 ed 	 	 con 	 tour 	 	.
and	here	you	can	see	a	subject	 hav 	 ing 	 	 phosphor 	 us 	 	 make 	 up 	 	 stipp 	 led 	 	on	her	face	.
and	now	what	we	're	looking	at	is	 re 	 ally 	 	creating	a	surface	capture	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	a	marker	capture	.
the	subject	 stand 	 s 	 	in	front	of	a	computer	array	of	 camera 	 s 	 	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	 camera 	 s 	 	can	,	frame	-	by	-	frame	,	 re 	 construct 	 	the	 geo 	 metry 	 	of	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	the	subject	's	 do 	 ing 	 	at	the	moment	.
so	,	 effective 	 ly 	 	,	you	get	3d	data	in	real	time	of	the	subject	.
and	if	you	look	in	a	 compar 	 ison 	 	,	on	the	left	,	we	see	what	 volu 	 metric 	 	data	 give 	 s 	 	us	and	on	the	right	you	see	what	 marker 	 s 	 	give	us	.
so	,	 clear 	 ly 	 	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	in	a	 sub 	 stantial 	 ly 	 	better	place	for	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	these	 we 	 re 	 	the	early	 day 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	technology	,	and	it	was	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	proven	yet	.
we	measure	 complex 	 ity 	 	and	fidelity	of	data	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 polygon 	 al 	 	count	.
and	so	,	on	the	left	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	100,000	 polygon 	 s 	 	.
we	could	go	up	 in 	 to 	 	the	 million 	 s 	 	of	 polygon 	 s 	 	.
it	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	be	infinite	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	when	we	had	our	``	aha	!	``
 th 	 is 	 	was	the	 break 	 through 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	when	we	're	like	,	``	ok	,	we	're	going	to	be	ok	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	to	work	.	``
and	the	``	aha	!	``	was	,	what	if	we	could	take	brad	pitt	,	and	we	could	put	brad	in	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	,	and	use	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 tour 	 	process	,
and	we	could	 stipp 	 le 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	 phosphor 	 escent 	 	 make 	 up 	 	and	put	him	under	the	black	 light 	 s 	 	,
and	we	could	,	in	fact	,	 s 	 can 	 	him	in	real	time	 perform 	 ing 	 	ekman	's	facs	 pose 	 s 	 	.
right	?	so	,	 effective 	 ly 	 	,	we	 end 	 ed 	 	up	with	a	3d	 data 	 base 	 	of	 every 	 thing 	 	brad	pitt	's	face	is	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 do 	 ing 	 	.
from	there	,	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 carv 	 ed 	 	up	 t 	 hose 	 	 face 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 small 	 er 	 	 piece 	 s 	 	and	 component 	 s 	 	of	his	face	.
so	we	 end 	 ed 	 	up	with	 liter 	 ally 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	and	 thousand 	 s 	 	and	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 shape 	 s 	 	,
a	complete	 data 	 base 	 	of	all	 possibil 	 ities 	 	that	his	face	is	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 do 	 ing 	 	.
now	,	that	's	great	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	we	had	him	at	age	44	.
we	need	to	put	 an 	 other 	 	40	 year 	 s 	 	on	him	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	.
we	 br 	 ought 	 	in	rick	 bake 	 r 	 	,	and	rick	is	one	of	the	great	 make 	 up 	 	and	special	 effect 	 s 	 	 guru 	 s 	 	of	our	industry	.
and	we	 al 	 so 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	in	a	 gentle 	 man 	 	named	kazu	tsuji	,	and	kazu	tsuji	is	one	of	the	great	 photo 	 re 	 alist 	 	 sculpt 	 ors 	 	of	our	time	.
and	we	 commission 	 ed 	 	them	to	make	a	maquette	,	or	a	bust	,	of	benjamin	.
so	,	in	the	spirit	of	``	the	great	 unveil 	 ing 	 	``	--	i	had	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	--	i	had	to	unveil	 some 	 thing 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	ben	80	.
we	 create 	 d 	 	three	of	these	:	there	's	ben	80	,	there	's	ben	70	,	there	's	ben	60	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 be 	 came 	 	the	template	for	moving	forward	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	made	from	a	life	cast	of	brad	.
so	,	in	fact	,	 an 	 atomic 	 ally 	 	,	it	is	correct	.
the	 eye 	 s 	 	,	the	jaw	,	the	 tee 	 th 	 	:
 every 	 thing 	 	is	in	perfect	 align 	 ment 	 	with	what	the	real	guy	 ha 	 s 	 	.	we	have	these	 maquette 	 s 	 	 s 	 can 	 ned 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	computer	at	 ver 	 y 	 	high	 re 	 solution 	 	--
enormous	 polygon 	 al 	 	count	.
and	so	now	we	had	three	age	 increment 	 s 	 	of	benjamin	in	the	computer	.
but	we	 need 	 ed 	 	to	get	a	 data 	 base 	 	of	him	 do 	 ing 	 	more	than	that	.
we	went	through	 th 	 is 	 	process	,	then	,	 call 	 ed 	 	 re 	 target 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	brad	 do 	 ing 	 	one	of	the	ekman	facs	 pose 	 s 	 	.
and	here	's	the	 result 	 ing 	 	data	that	 come 	 s 	 	from	that	,	the	model	that	 come 	 s 	 	from	that	.	 re 	 target 	 ing 	 	is	the	process	of	 trans 	 posing 	 	that	data	onto	 an 	 other 	 	model	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	the	life	cast	,	or	the	bust	--	the	maquette	--	of	benjamin	was	made	from	brad	,	we	could	 trans 	 pose 	 	the	data	of	brad	at	44	onto	brad	at	87	.
so	now	,	we	had	a	3d	 data 	 base 	 	of	 every 	 thing 	 	brad	pitt	's	face	can	do	at	age	87	,	in	his	70s	and	in	his	60s	.
next	we	had	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	 shoot 	 ing 	 	process	.
so	while	all	that	's	going	on	,	we	're	down	in	new	orleans	and	 location 	 s 	 	around	the	world	.
and	we	shot	our	body	 act 	 ors 	 	,	and	we	shot	them	 wear 	 ing 	 	blue	 hood 	 s 	 	.
so	these	are	the	 gentle 	 man 	 	who	 play 	 ed 	 	benjamin	.
and	the	blue	 hood 	 s 	 	 help 	 ed 	 	us	with	two	 thing 	 s 	 	:	one	,	we	could	 eas 	 ily 	 	 er 	 ase 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 head 	 s 	 	;	and	we	 al 	 so 	 	put	 track 	 ing 	 	 marker 	 s 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 head 	 s 	 	so	we	could	 re 	 create 	 	the	camera	motion	and	the	lens	 optic 	 s 	 	from	the	set	.
but	now	we	 need 	 ed 	 	to	get	brad	's	performance	to	drive	our	virtual	benjamin	.
and	so	we	 edit 	 ed 	 	the	 foot 	 age 	 	that	was	shot	on	location	with	the	rest	of	the	cast	and	the	body	 act 	 ors 	 	and	about	six	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	we	 br 	 ought 	 	brad	onto	a	sound	stage	in	los	angeles	and	he	 watch 	 ed 	 	on	the	screen	.	his	job	,	then	,	was	to	 be 	 come 	 	benjamin	.
and	so	we	 loop 	 ed 	 	the	 scene 	 s 	 	.
he	 watch 	 ed 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	.
we	 encourag 	 ed 	 	him	to	 improv 	 ise 	 	.
and	he	took	benjamin	 in 	 to 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	and	 un 	 usual 	 	 place 	 s 	 	that	we	did	n't	think	he	was	going	to	go	.
we	shot	him	with	four	hd	 camera 	 s 	 	so	we	'd	get	 multi 	 ple 	 	 view 	 s 	 	of	him	and	then	david	would	 choos 	 e 	 	the	take	of	brad	 be 	 ing 	 	benjamin	that	he	thought	best	 match 	 ed 	 	the	 foot 	 age 	 	with	the	rest	of	the	cast	.
from	there	we	went	 in 	 to 	 	a	process	 call 	 ed 	 	image	analysis	.
and	so	here	,	you	can	see	 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	 chose 	 n 	 	take	.	and	you	are	 see 	 ing 	 	,	now	,	that	data	 be 	 ing 	 	 trans 	 posed 	 	on	to	ben	87	.
and	so	,	what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	we	used	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	image	analysis	,	which	is	taking	 tim 	 ing 	 s 	 	from	different	 component 	 s 	 	of	benjamin	's	face	.
and	so	we	could	 choos 	 e 	 	,	say	,	his	left	 eye 	 brow 	 	.
and	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	would	tell	us	that	,	well	,	in	frame	14	the	left	 eye 	 brow 	 	 begin 	 s 	 	to	move	from	here	to	here	,	and	it	 conclude 	 s 	 	moving	in	frame	32	.
and	so	we	could	 choos 	 e 	 	 number 	 s 	 	of	 position 	 s 	 	on	the	face	to	pull	that	data	from	.
and	then	,	the	sauce	i	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	with	our	technology	stew	--	that	secret	sauce	was	,	 effective 	 ly 	 	,	 soft 	 ware 	 	that	 allow 	 ed 	 	us	to	match	the	performance	 foot 	 age 	 	of	brad	in	live	action	with	our	 data 	 base 	 	of	aged	benjamin	,	the	facs	 shape 	 s 	 	that	we	had	.
on	a	frame	-	by	-	frame	 bas 	 is 	 	,	we	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	 re 	 construct 	 	a	3d	head	that	 exact 	 ly 	 	 match 	 ed 	 	the	performance	of	brad	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	was	how	the	 finish 	 ed 	 	shot	 appear 	 ed 	 	in	the	film	.
and	here	you	can	see	the	body	 a 	 ctor 	 	.
and	then	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	 call 	 ed 	 	the	``	dead	head	,	``	no	 re 	 ference 	 	to	jerry	garcia	.
and	then	here	's	the	 re 	 construct 	 ed 	 	performance	now	with	the	 tim 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	the	performance	.
and	then	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	final	shot	.
it	was	a	long	process	.
the	next	section	here	,	i	'm	going	to	just	blast	through	 th 	 is 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	could	do	a	whole	tedtalk	on	the	next	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 slide 	 s 	 	.
we	had	to	create	a	 light 	 ing 	 	system	.
so	 re 	 ally 	 	,	a	big	part	of	our	 process 	 es 	 	was	creating	a	 light 	 ing 	 	environment	for	every	single	location	that	benjamin	had	to	appear	so	that	we	could	put	ben	's	head	 in 	 to 	 	any	scene	and	it	would	 exact 	 ly 	 	match	the	 light 	 ing 	 	that	's	on	the	other	 act 	 ors 	 	in	the	real	world	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	had	to	create	an	eye	system	.
we	found	the	old	 ad 	 age 	 	,	you	know	,	``	the	 eye 	 s 	 	are	the	window	to	the	soul	,	``	 absolute 	 ly 	 	true	.
so	the	key	here	was	to	keep	 every 	 body 	 	looking	in	ben	's	 eye 	 s 	 	.
and	if	you	could	feel	the	 warm 	 th 	 	,	and	feel	the	 human 	 ity 	 	,	and	feel	his	intent	coming	through	the	 eye 	 s 	 	,	then	we	would	succeed	.
so	we	had	one	person	focused	on	the	eye	system	for	 al 	 most 	 	two	full	 year 	 s 	 	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	had	to	create	a	mouth	system	.
we	 work 	 ed 	 	from	 dent 	 al 	 	 mold 	 s 	 	of	brad	.
we	had	to	age	the	 tee 	 th 	 	over	time	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	had	to	create	an	 articul 	 ating 	 	tongue	that	 allow 	 ed 	 	him	to	 e 	 nunci 	 ate 	 	his	 word 	 s 	 	.
there	was	a	whole	system	written	in	 soft 	 ware 	 	to	articulate	the	tongue	.
we	had	one	person	 devote 	 d 	 	to	the	tongue	for	about	nine	 month 	 s 	 	.
he	was	 ver 	 y 	 	popular	.
skin	 dis 	 placement 	 	:	 an 	 other 	 	big	deal	.
the	skin	had	to	be	 absolute 	 ly 	 	accurate	.	he	's	 al 	 so 	 	in	an	old	age	home	,	he	's	in	a	 nurs 	 ing 	 	home	around	other	old	people	,	so	he	had	to	look	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	 a 	 s 	 	the	 other 	 s 	 	.
so	,	 lot 	 s 	 	of	work	on	skin	 de 	 form 	 ation 	 	,	you	can	see	in	some	of	these	 case 	 s 	 	it	 work 	 s 	 	,	in	some	 case 	 s 	 	it	 look 	 s 	 	bad	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	early	test	in	our	process	.
so	,	 effective 	 ly 	 	we	 create 	 d 	 	a	digital	puppet	that	brad	pitt	could	 oper 	 ate 	 	with	his	own	face	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	no	 anim 	 ators 	 	 necess 	 ary 	 	to	come	in	and	interpret	behavior	or	enhance	his	performance	.
there	was	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	 en 	 counter 	 ed 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	that	we	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 call 	 ing 	 	``	the	digital	botox	effect	.	``
so	,	 a 	 s 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	went	through	 th 	 is 	 	process	,	fincher	would	 al 	 ways 	 	say	,	``	it	 sand 	 blast 	 s 	 	the	 edge 	 s 	 	off	of	the	performance	.	``
and	thing	our	process	and	the	technology	could	n't	do	,	is	they	could	n't	understand	intent	,	the	intent	of	the	 a 	 ctor 	 	.
so	it	 s 	 ees 	 	a	 s 	 mile 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 s 	 mile 	 	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 recogn 	 ize 	 	an	 iron 	 ic 	 	 s 	 mile 	 	,	or	a	happy	 s 	 mile 	 	,	or	a	 frust 	 rated 	 	 s 	 mile 	 	.
so	it	did	take	 human 	 s 	 	to	kind	of	push	it	one	way	or	 an 	 other 	 	.
but	we	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 call 	 ing 	 	the	entire	process	and	all	the	technology	``	emotion	capture	,	``	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	just	motion	capture	.
take	 an 	 other 	 	look	.
brad	pitt	:	well	,	i	heard	 mom 	 ma 	 	and	tizzy	whisper	,	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	i	was	gon	na	die	soon	,
but	...	 may 	 be 	 	not	.
eu	:	that	's	how	to	create	a	digital	human	in	18	 minute 	 s 	 	.
a	couple	of	quick	 fact 	 oid 	 s 	 	;
it	 re 	 ally 	 	took	155	people	over	two	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	we	did	n't	even	talk	about	60	 hair 	 style 	 s 	 	and	an	all	-	digital	 hair 	 cut 	 	.
but	,	that	is	benjamin	.	thank	you	.
