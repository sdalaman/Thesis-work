what	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	talk	to	you	about	 to 	 day 	 	is	two	 thing 	 s 	 	:	one	,	the	rise	of	a	culture	of	 avail 	 ability 	 	;	and	two	,	a	request	.
so	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	a	rise	of	 th 	 is 	 	 avail 	 ability 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	driven	by	mobile	 de 	 vice 	 	 pro 	 life 	 ration 	 	,	 global 	 ly 	 	,	 a 	 cross 	 	all	social	 strat 	 a 	 	.
we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	,	 a 	 long 	 	with	that	 pro 	 life 	 ration 	 	of	mobile	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	,
an	 expect 	 ation 	 	of	 avail 	 ability 	 	.
and	,	with	that	,	 come 	 s 	 	the	third	point	,
which	is	 oblig 	 ation 	 	--	and	an	 oblig 	 ation 	 	to	that	 avail 	 ability 	 	.
and	the	problem	is	,	we	're	still	 work 	 ing 	 	through	,	from	a	 socie 	 tal 	 	 stand 	 point 	 	,	how	we	allow	people	to	be	 avail 	 able 	 	.
there	's	a	significant	 del 	 ta 	 	,	in	fact	,	between	what	we	're	 will 	 ing 	 	to	accept	.	 apolog 	 ies 	 	to	hans	rosling	--	he	 s 	 aid 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	that	's	not	using	real	 stat 	 s 	 	is	a	lie	--	but	the	big	 del 	 ta 	 	there
is	how	we	deal	with	 th 	 is 	 	from	a	public	 stand 	 point 	 	.
so	we	've	 develop 	 ed 	 	certain	 tactic 	 s 	 	and	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 
to	cover	up	.
 th 	 is 	 	first	one	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	lean	.	``	and	if	you	've	ever	 be 	 en 	 	in	a	 meet 	 ing 	 	where	you	play	sort	of	 meet 	 ing 	 	``	chicken	,	``	you	're	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	,	looking	at	the	person	,	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	them	to	look	away	,
and	then	 quick 	 ly 	 	 check 	 ing 	 	the	 de 	 vice 	 	.
 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	you	can	see	the	 gentle 	 man 	 	up	on	the	right	is	 bust 	 ing 	 	him	.
``	the	stretch	.	``	ok	,	the	 gentle 	 man 	 	on	the	left	is	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	screw	you	,	i	'm	going	to	check	my	 de 	 vice 	 	.	``	but	the	guy	,	here	,	on	the	right	,
he	's	 do 	 ing 	 	the	stretch	.
it	's	that	reeeee	-	e	-	e	-	each	out	,	the	physical	 con 	 tort 	 ion 	 
to	get	that	 de 	 vice 	 	just	 be 	 low 	 	the	 table 	 top 	 	.
or	,	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	,	the	``	love	you	;	mean	it	.	``	 noth 	 ing 	 	 say 	 s 	 	``	i	love	you	``	like	``	let	me	find	 some 	 body 	 	else	i	give	a	damn	about	.	``	or	,	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	coming	to	us	from	india	.	you	can	find	 th 	 is 	 	on	youtube	,	the	 gentle 	 man 	 	who	's	 re 	 cum 	 bent 	 	on	a	 motor 	 cycle 	 
while	text	 mess 	 aging 	 	.
or	what	we	call	the	``	sweet	 gra 	 vy 	 	,	stop	me	before	i	kill	 aga 	 in 	 	!	``	that	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	 de 	 vice 	 	.
what	 th 	 is 	 	is	 do 	 ing 	 	is	,	we	find	a	--	a	direct	collision	--	we	find	a	direct	collision	between	 avail 	 ability 	 	--
and	what	's	possible	through	 avail 	 ability 	 	--
and	a	fundamental	human	need	--	which	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 hear 	 ing 	 	about	a	lot	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	--
the	need	to	create	 share 	 d 	 	 narrative 	 s 	 	.
we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	good	at	creating	personal	 narrative 	 s 	 	,
but	it	's	the	 share 	 d 	 	 narrative 	 s 	 	that	make	us	a	culture	.
and	when	you	're	 stand 	 ing 	 	with	 some 	 one 	 	,	and	you	're	on	your	mobile	 de 	 vice 	 	,	 effective 	 ly 	 	what	you	're	 say 	 ing 	 	to	them	is	,	``	you	are	not	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 a 	 s 	 	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	 al 	 most 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	that	could	come	to	me	through	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	.	``	look	around	you	.
there	might	be	 some 	 body 	 	on	one	right	now	,
 particip 	 ating 	 	in	multi	-	dimensional	 engage 	 ment 	 	.
our	 re 	 ality 	 	right	now	is	less	 interest 	 ing 	 
than	the	story	we	're	going	to	tell	about	it	 lat 	 er 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	one	i	love	.
 th 	 is 	 	poor	kid	,	 clear 	 ly 	 	a	prop	--
do	n't	get	me	wrong	,	a	 will 	 ing 	 	prop	--
but	the	kiss	that	's	 be 	 ing 	 	 document 	 ed 	 	kind	of	 look 	 s 	 	like	it	 suck 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	sound	of	one	hand	 clap 	 ping 	 	.
so	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	lose	the	 con 	 text 	 	of	our	 ident 	 ity 	 	,	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	that	what	you	share	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	the	 con 	 text 	 	of	 share 	 d 	 	narrative	,	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	the	 con 	 text 	 	in	which	we	live	.	the	 st 	 ories 	 	that	we	tell	--	what	we	push	out	--
 be 	 come 	 s 	 	who	we	are	.
people	are	n't	 simpl 	 y 	 	 project 	 ing 	 	 ident 	 ity 	 	,
they	're	creating	it	.
we	are	creating	the	technology	that	is	going	to	create	the	new	 share 	 d 	 	experience	,	which	will	create	the	new	world	.
and	so	my	request	is	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	,	let	's	make	 techno 	 logies 	 	that	make	people	more	human	,	and	not	less	.
thank	you	.
