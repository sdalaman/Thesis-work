i	'd	like	to	talk	a	little	bit	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	about	what	 happen 	 s 	 	if	we	move	from	design	to	design	 think 	 ing 	 	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	old	photo	up	there	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	first	project	i	was	ever	 hire 	 d 	 	to	do	,
 some 	 thing 	 	like	25	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
it	's	a	 wood 	 work 	 ing 	 	machine	,	or	at	 l 	 east 	 	a	piece	of	one	,
and	my	task	was	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	thing	a	little	bit	more	modern	,	a	little	bit	 eas 	 ier 	 	to	use	.
i	thought	,	at	the	time	,	i	did	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	job	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	not	 ver 	 y 	 	long	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	company	went	out	of	business	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	second	project	that	i	did	.	it	's	a	fax	machine	.
i	put	an	 attract 	 ive 	 	shell	around	some	new	technology	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	18	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	the	product	was	 obsolet 	 e 	 	.
and	now	,	of	course	,	the	whole	technology	is	 obsolet 	 e 	 	.
now	,	i	'm	a	 fair 	 ly 	 	 s 	 low 	 	 learn 	 er 	 	,
but	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	it	 occur 	 red 	 	to	me	that	 may 	 be 	 	what	 pass 	 ed 	 	for	design	was	n't	all	that	 import 	 ant 	 	--	making	 thing 	 s 	 	more	 attract 	 ive 	 	,	making	them	a	bit	 eas 	 ier 	 	to	use	,	making	them	more	 market 	 able 	 	.
by	 focus 	 ing 	 	on	a	design	,	 may 	 be 	 	just	a	single	product	,	i	was	 be 	 ing 	 	 increment 	 al 	 	and	not	 hav 	 ing 	 	much	of	an	impact	.
but	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	small	view	of	design	is	a	 relat 	 ively 	 	 re 	 cent 	 	 phenomen 	 on 	 	,	and	in	fact	 re 	 ally 	 	 emerge 	 d 	 	in	the	 lat 	 ter 	 	half	of	the	20th	century	 a 	 s 	 	design	 be 	 came 	 	a	tool	of	 consumer 	 ism 	 	.
so	when	we	talk	about	design	 to 	 day 	 	,	and	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	when	we	read	about	it	in	the	popular	press	,	we	're	often	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 product 	 s 	 	like	these	.
 am 	 using 	 	?	 y 	 es 	 	.	 desir 	 able 	 	?	 may 	 be 	 	.
 import 	 ant 	 	?	not	so	 ver 	 y 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	was	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	the	way	.
and	i	'd	like	to	suggest	that	if	we	take	a	different	view	of	design	,	and	focus	less	on	the	object	and	more	on	design	 think 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	approach	,	that	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	might	see	the	result	in	a	 big 	 ger 	 	impact	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	 gentle 	 man 	 	,	isambard	 king 	 dom 	 	brunel	,	designed	 man 	 y 	 	great	 thing 	 s 	 	in	his	 care 	 er 	 	in	the	19th	century	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	the	clifton	 s 	 us 	 pension 	 	bridge	in	bristol	and	the	thames	tunnel	at	rotherhithe	.
both	great	 design 	 s 	 	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 innov 	 ative 	 	too	.
his	 great 	 est 	 	creation	 run 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	right	through	here	in	oxford	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	great	western	 rail 	 way 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	a	kid	i	grew	up	 ver 	 y 	 	close	to	here	,
and	one	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	to	do	was	to	cycle	 a 	 long 	 	by	the	side	of	the	 rail 	 way 	 	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	the	great	big	express	 train 	 s 	 	to	roar	past	.
you	can	see	it	 represent 	 ed 	 	here	in	j.m.w	.	turner	's	 paint 	 ing 	 	,	``	rain	,	 s 	 team 	 	and	speed	``	.
now	,	what	brunel	 s 	 aid 	 	that	he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	for	his	 passenger 	 s 	 	was	the	experience	of	 float 	 ing 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 country 	 side 	 	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	back	in	the	19th	century	.
and	to	do	that	 me 	 ant 	 	creating	the	 flat 	 test 	 	 grad 	 ient 	 s 	 	that	had	ever	yet	 be 	 en 	 	made	,	which	 me 	 ant 	 	building	long	 via 	 duct 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	river	 val 	 ley 	 s 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	 via 	 duct 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	thames	at	maidenhead	--	and	long	 tunnel 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	one	at	box	,	in	wiltshire	.
but	he	did	n't	stop	there	.	he	did	n't	stop	with	just	 try 	 ing 	 	to	design	the	best	 rail 	 way 	 	journey	.
he	 imagin 	 ed 	 	an	 integrate 	 d 	 	 transport 	 ation 	 	system	in	which	it	would	be	possible	for	a	passenger	to	embark	on	a	train	in	london	and	 dis 	 embark 	 	from	a	ship	in	new	york	.
one	journey	from	london	to	new	york	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	s.s.	great	western	that	he	built	to	take	care	of	the	second	half	of	that	journey	.
now	,	brunel	was	 work 	 ing 	 	100	 year 	 s 	 	before	the	emergence	of	the	design	profession	,
but	i	think	he	was	using	design	 think 	 ing 	 	to	solve	 problem 	 s 	 	and	to	create	world	-	changing	 innov 	 ations 	 	.
now	,	design	 think 	 ing 	 	 begin 	 s 	 	with	what	roger	martin	,	the	business	school	professor	at	the	university	of	toronto	,	 call 	 s 	 	 integ 	 rative 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	.
and	that	's	the	ability	to	exploit	 oppos 	 ing 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	and	 oppos 	 ing 	 	 constraint 	 s 	 	to	create	new	 solution 	 s 	 	.
in	the	case	of	design	,	that	 mean 	 s 	 	 balanc 	 ing 	 	 desir 	 ability 	 	,	what	 human 	 s 	 	need	,	with	technical	 feas 	 ibility 	 	,	and	economic	 vi 	 ability 	 	.
with	 innov 	 ations 	 	like	the	great	western	,	we	can	stretch	that	balance	to	the	absolute	limit	.
so	 some 	 how 	 	,	we	went	from	 th 	 is 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
 system 	 s 	 	 think 	 ers 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 invent 	 ing 	 	the	world	,	to	a	 priest 	 hood 	 	of	 folk 	 s 	 	in	black	 turtle 	 neck 	 s 	 	and	 design 	 er 	 	 glass 	 es 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	small	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	our	industrial	 socie 	 ty 	 	 matur 	 ed 	 	,	so	design	 be 	 came 	 	a	profession	and	it	focused	on	an	ever	 small 	 er 	 	canvas	 un 	 til 	 	it	came	to	stand	for	 aesthetic 	 s 	 	,	image	and	fashion	.
now	i	'm	not	 try 	 ing 	 	to	throw	 stone 	 s 	 	here	.
i	'm	a	fully	paid	-	up	member	of	that	 priest 	 hood 	 	,	and	 some 	 where 	 	in	here	i	have	my	 design 	 er 	 	 glass 	 es 	 	.
there	we	go	.
but	i	do	think	that	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	design	is	 get 	 ting 	 	big	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	that	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	through	the	application	of	design	 think 	 ing 	 	to	new	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 problem 	 s 	 	--	to	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	,	to	education	,	 health 	 care 	 	,	security	,	clean	water	,	 what 	 ever 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	we	see	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 emergence 	 	of	design	 think 	 ing 	 	and	we	see	it	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	tackle	new	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 problem 	 s 	 	,	there	are	some	 bas 	 ic 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	that	i	think	we	can	 observ 	 e 	 	that	are	 use 	 ful 	 	.
and	i	'd	like	to	talk	about	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	just	for	the	next	few	 minute 	 s 	 	.
the	first	of	 t 	 hose 	 	is	that	design	is	human	-	 center 	 ed 	 	.
it	may	integrate	technology	and	 economic 	 s 	 	,	but	it	 start 	 s 	 	with	what	 human 	 s 	 	need	,	or	might	need	.
what	 make 	 s 	 	life	 eas 	 ier 	 	,	more	 enjoy 	 able 	 	?
what	 make 	 s 	 	technology	 use 	 ful 	 	and	 us 	 able 	 	?
but	that	is	more	than	 simpl 	 y 	 	good	 er 	 gon 	 omics 	 	,	 put 	 ting 	 	the	 button 	 s 	 	in	the	right	place	.
it	's	often	about	 understand 	 ing 	 	culture	and	 con 	 text 	 	before	we	even	know	where	to	start	to	have	 idea 	 s 	 	.
so	when	a	team	was	 work 	 ing 	 	on	a	new	vision	 screen 	 ing 	 	program	in	india	,	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	understand	what	the	 aspir 	 ations 	 	and	 motiv 	 ations 	 	 we 	 re 	 	of	these	school	children	to	understand	how	they	might	play	a	role	in	 screen 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	.
 con 	 version 	 	sound	 ha 	 s 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	high	quality	,	ultra	-	low	-	cost	digital	 hear 	 ing 	 	aid	for	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	.
now	,	in	the	west	we	 re 	 ly 	 	on	 high 	 ly 	 	trained	 technician 	 s 	 	to	fit	these	 hear 	 ing 	 	 aid 	 s 	 	.
in	 place 	 s 	 	like	india	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 technician 	 s 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	do	n't	exist	.
so	it	took	a	team	 work 	 ing 	 	in	india	with	 patient 	 s 	 	and	community	health	 work 	 ers 	 	to	understand	how	a	pda	and	an	application	on	a	pda	might	replace	 t 	 hose 	 	 technician 	 s 	 	in	a	fitting	and	 diagnos 	 tic 	 	service	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	 start 	 ing 	 	with	technology	,	the	team	 start 	 ed 	 	with	people	and	culture	.
so	if	human	need	is	the	place	to	start	,	then	design	 think 	 ing 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	 move 	 s 	 	on	to	 learn 	 ing 	 	by	making	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	 think 	 ing 	 	about	what	to	build	,	building	in	order	to	think	.
now	,	 prototype 	 s 	 	speed	up	the	process	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	,
 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	 on 	 ly 	 	when	we	put	our	 idea 	 s 	 	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	world	that	we	 re 	 ally 	 	start	to	understand	 the 	 ir 	 	 strength 	 s 	 	and	 weak 	 ness 	 es 	 	.
and	the	 fast 	 er 	 	we	do	that	,	the	 fast 	 er 	 	our	 idea 	 s 	 	evolve	.
now	,	much	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	and	written	about	the	aravind	eye	institute	in	madurai	,	india	.
they	do	an	 in 	 credible 	 	job	of	 serv 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	poor	 patient 	 s 	 	by	taking	the	 revenue 	 s 	 	from	 t 	 hose 	 	who	can	afford	to	pay	to	cross	-	subsidize	 t 	 hose 	 	who	can	not	.
now	,	they	are	 ver 	 y 	 	efficient	,	but	they	are	 al 	 so 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 innov 	 ative 	 	.
when	i	 visit 	 ed 	 	them	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	what	 re 	 ally 	 	 impress 	 ed 	 	me	was	 the 	 ir 	 	 will 	 ing 	 ness 	 	to	prototype	 the 	 ir 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	early	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	 facil 	 ity 	 	for	one	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 big 	 gest 	 	cost	 break 	 through 	 s 	 	.
they	make	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 intra 	 ocular 	 	 lens 	 es 	 	.
these	are	the	 lens 	 es 	 	that	replace	 t 	 hose 	 	that	are	 damage 	 d 	 	by	 cataract 	 s 	 	.
and	i	think	it	's	 part 	 ly 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 proto 	 ty 	 ping 	 	 ment 	 ality 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 allow 	 ed 	 	them	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	the	 break 	 through 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	they	 br 	 ought 	 	the	cost	down	from	$	200	a	pair	,	down	to	just	$	4	a	pair	.
 part 	 ly 	 	they	did	 th 	 is 	 	by	 in 	 stead 	 	of	building	a	 f 	 ancy 	 	new	 factor 	 y 	 	,	they	used	the	 base 	 ment 	 	of	one	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 hospital 	 s 	 	.
and	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 install 	 ing 	 	the	large	-	scale	 machine 	 s 	 	used	by	western	 produce 	 rs 	 	,	they	used	low	-	cost	cad	/	cam	 proto 	 ty 	 ping 	 	technology	.
they	are	now	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 manufactur 	 er 	 	of	these	 lens 	 es 	 	in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	and	have	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 move 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	custom	 factor 	 y 	 	.
so	if	human	need	is	the	place	to	start	,	and	 proto 	 ty 	 ping 	 	,	a	vehicle	for	progress	,	then	there	are	 al 	 so 	 	some	 question 	 s 	 	to	ask	about	the	destination	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	 see 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 prim 	 ary 	 	 object 	 ive 	 	 a 	 s 	 	consumption	,	design	 think 	 ing 	 	is	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	explore	the	potential	of	 particip 	 ation 	 	--
the	shift	from	a	 pass 	 ive 	 	relationship	between	consumer	and	 produce 	 r 	 	to	the	active	 engage 	 ment 	 	of	 every 	 one 	 	in	 experience 	 s 	 	that	are	 meaning 	 ful 	 	,	productive	and	 profit 	 able 	 	.
so	i	'd	like	to	take	the	idea	that	rory	sutherland	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	,	 th 	 is 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	that	 in 	 tangible 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	are	worth	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	more	than	physical	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	take	that	a	little	bit	further	and	say	that	i	think	the	design	of	 particip 	 atory 	 	 system 	 s 	 	,	in	which	 man 	 y 	 	more	 form 	 s 	 	of	value	beyond	 simpl 	 y 	 	cash	are	both	 create 	 d 	 	and	 measur 	 ed 	 	,	is	going	to	be	the	major	theme	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	for	design	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	for	our	 eco 	 nomy 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	go	forward	.
so	william	beveridge	,	when	he	wrote	the	first	of	his	famous	 report 	 s 	 	in	1942	,	 create 	 d 	 	what	 be 	 came 	 	britain	's	 wel 	 fare 	 	state	in	which	he	 hop 	 ed 	 	that	every	citizen	would	be	an	active	 particip 	 ant 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	social	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	.
by	the	time	he	wrote	his	third	report	,	he	 confess 	 ed 	 	that	he	had	 fail 	 ed 	 	and	 in 	 stead 	 	had	 create 	 d 	 	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	of	 wel 	 fare 	 	 consumer 	 s 	 	.
hilary	cottam	,	charlie	leadbeater	,	and	hugo	manassei	of	participle	have	taken	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	 particip 	 ation 	 	,	and	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 manifest 	 o 	 	 en 	 titled 	 	beveridge	4.0	,	they	are	 suggest 	 ing 	 	a	 frame 	 work 	 	for	 re 	 invent 	 ing 	 	the	 wel 	 fare 	 	state	.
so	in	one	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 project 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	southwark	circle	,	they	 work 	 ed 	 	with	 resident 	 s 	 	in	southwark	,	south	london	and	a	small	team	of	 design 	 ers 	 	to	develop	a	new	 member 	 ship 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	to	help	the	 elder 	 ly 	 	with	 house 	 hold 	 	 task 	 s 	 	.
 design 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 refine 	 d 	 	and	 develop 	 ed 	 	with	150	 old 	 er 	 	people	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	before	the	service	was	 launch 	 ed 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	.
we	can	take	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	 particip 	 ation 	 	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	to	 it 	 s 	 	logical	 con 	 clusion 	 	and	say	that	design	may	have	 it 	 s 	 	 great 	 est 	 	impact	when	it	's	taken	out	of	the	 hand 	 s 	 	of	 design 	 ers 	 	and	put	 in 	 to 	 	the	 hand 	 s 	 	of	 every 	 one 	 	.
 nurse 	 s 	 	and	 practitioner 	 s 	 	at	u.s.	 health 	 care 	 	system	kaiser	permanente	 stud 	 y 	 	the	 top 	 ic 	 	of	 improv 	 ing 	 	the	patient	experience	,
and	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	focused	on	the	way	that	they	 ex 	 change 	 	knowledge	and	change	shift	.
through	a	program	of	 observ 	 ation 	 al 	 	research	,	 brain 	 storm 	 ing 	 	new	 solution 	 s 	 	and	rapid	 proto 	 ty 	 ping 	 	,	they	've	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	new	way	to	change	shift	.
they	went	from	 re 	 treat 	 ing 	 	to	the	nurse	's	station	to	discuss	the	 vari 	 ous 	 	 state 	 s 	 	and	 need 	 s 	 	of	 patient 	 s 	 	,	to	 develop 	 ing 	 	a	system	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	on	the	ward	in	front	of	 patient 	 s 	 	,	using	a	simple	 soft 	 ware 	 	tool	.
by	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	they	 br 	 ought 	 	the	time	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	away	from	 patient 	 s 	 	down	from	40	 minute 	 s 	 	to	12	 minute 	 s 	 	,	on	average	.
they	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	patient	confidence	and	nurse	happiness	.
when	you	 multi 	 ply 	 	that	by	all	the	 nurse 	 s 	 	in	all	the	 ward 	 s 	 	in	40	 hospital 	 s 	 	in	the	system	,	it	 result 	 ed 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	in	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	big	impact	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	one	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	in	 health 	 care 	 	 al 	 one 	 	.
so	these	are	just	some	of	the	kind	of	 bas 	 ic 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	around	design	 think 	 ing 	 	and	some	of	the	new	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 project 	 s 	 	that	they	're	 be 	 ing 	 	 appli 	 ed 	 	to	.
but	i	'd	like	to	go	back	to	brunel	here	,	and	suggest	a	 connect 	 ion 	 	that	might	explain	why	 th 	 is 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	now	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	why	design	 think 	 ing 	 	is	a	 use 	 ful 	 	tool	.
and	that	 connect 	 ion 	 	is	change	.
in	 time 	 s 	 	of	change	we	need	new	 alter 	 native 	 s 	 	,	new	 idea 	 s 	 	.
now	,	brunel	 work 	 ed 	 	at	the	height	of	the	industrial	revolution	,	when	all	of	life	and	our	 eco 	 nomy 	 	was	 be 	 ing 	 	 re 	 invent 	 ed 	 	.
now	the	industrial	 system 	 s 	 	of	brunel	's	time	have	run	 the 	 ir 	 	course	,	and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	they	are	part	of	the	problem	 to 	 day 	 	.
but	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	we	are	in	the	 mid 	 st 	 	of	massive	change	.
and	that	change	is	forcing	us	to	question	 quit 	 e 	 	fundamental	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	of	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	--	how	we	keep	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 health 	 y 	 	,	how	we	govern	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	how	we	 educ 	 ate 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	how	we	keep	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	secure	.
and	in	these	 time 	 s 	 	of	change	,	we	need	these	new	 choice 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	our	 exist 	 ing 	 	 solution 	 s 	 	are	 simpl 	 y 	 	 be 	 coming 	 	 obsolet 	 e 	 	.
so	why	design	 think 	 ing 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	it	 give 	 s 	 	us	a	new	way	of	 tack 	 ling 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	 default 	 ing 	 	to	our	normal	 converg 	 ent 	 	approach	where	we	make	the	best	choice	out	of	 avail 	 able 	 	 alter 	 native 	 s 	 	,	it	 encourag 	 es 	 	us	to	take	a	 diverge 	 nt 	 	approach	,	to	explore	new	 alter 	 native 	 s 	 	,	new	 solution 	 s 	 	,	new	 idea 	 s 	 	that	have	not	 exist 	 ed 	 	before	.
but	before	we	go	through	that	process	of	 diverge 	 nce 	 	,	there	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	an	 import 	 ant 	 	first	step	.
and	that	is	,	what	is	the	question	that	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	answer	?
what	's	the	design	brief	?
now	brunel	may	have	 ask 	 ed 	 	a	question	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	``	how	do	i	take	a	train	from	london	to	new	york	?	``
but	what	are	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 question 	 s 	 	that	we	might	ask	 to 	 day 	 	?
so	these	are	some	that	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	think	about	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	.
and	one	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	is	one	that	we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	on	with	the	acumen	fund	,	in	a	project	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	funded	by	the	bill	and	melinda	 gate 	 s 	 	 found 	 ation 	 	.
how	might	we	improve	access	to	safe	 drink 	 ing 	 	water	for	the	world	's	 poor 	 est 	 	people	,	and	at	the	same	time	 stimul 	 ate 	 	 innov 	 ation 	 	 among 	 st 	 	local	water	 provide 	 rs 	 	?
so	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	bunch	of	american	 design 	 ers 	 	come	up	with	new	 idea 	 s 	 	that	may	or	may	not	have	 be 	 en 	 	appropriate	,	we	took	a	sort	of	more	open	,	 collabor 	 ative 	 	and	 particip 	 ative 	 	approach	.
we	 team 	 ed 	 	 design 	 ers 	 	and	 invest 	 ment 	 	 expert 	 s 	 	up	with	11	water	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	india	.
and	through	 work 	 shop 	 s 	 	they	 develop 	 ed 	 	 innov 	 ative 	 	new	 product 	 s 	 	,	 service 	 s 	 	,	and	business	 model 	 s 	 	.
we	 host 	 ed 	 	a	 com 	 petition 	 	and	then	funded	five	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	to	develop	 the 	 ir 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	.
so	they	 develop 	 ed 	 	and	 ite 	 rated 	 	these	 idea 	 s 	 	.
and	then	ideo	and	acumen	 s 	 pent 	 	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 week 	 s 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	with	them	to	help	design	new	social	 market 	 ing 	 	 campaign 	 s 	 	,	community	 out 	 reach 	 	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	,	business	 model 	 s 	 	,	new	water	 vessel 	 s 	 	for	storing	water	and	 cart 	 s 	 	for	 deliver 	 ing 	 	water	.
some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	are	just	 get 	 ting 	 	 launch 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	market	.
and	the	same	process	is	just	 get 	 ting 	 	 under 	 way 	 	with	ngos	in	east	africa	.
so	for	me	,	 th 	 is 	 	project	 show 	 s 	 	kind	of	how	far	we	can	go	from	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	sort	of	small	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	was	 work 	 ing 	 	on	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	my	 care 	 er 	 	.
that	by	 focus 	 ing 	 	on	the	 need 	 s 	 	of	 human 	 s 	 	and	by	using	 prototype 	 s 	 	to	move	 idea 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	by	 get 	 ting 	 	the	process	out	of	the	 hand 	 s 	 	of	 design 	 ers 	 	,	and	by	 get 	 ting 	 	the	active	 particip 	 ation 	 	of	the	community	,	we	can	tackle	 big 	 ger 	 	and	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	 question 	 s 	 	.
and	just	like	brunel	,	by	 focus 	 ing 	 	on	 system 	 s 	 	,	we	can	have	a	 big 	 ger 	 	impact	.
so	that	's	one	thing	that	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	.
i	'm	 actual 	 ly 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	,	and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	more	 interest 	 ed 	 	to	know	what	 th 	 is 	 	community	 think 	 s 	 	we	could	work	on	.
what	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 question 	 s 	 	do	we	think	design	 think 	 ing 	 	could	be	used	to	tackle	?
and	if	you	've	got	any	 idea 	 s 	 	then	feel	free	,	you	can	post	them	to	twitter	.
there	is	a	hash	tag	there	that	you	can	use	,	#	cbdq	.
and	the	list	 look 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	a	little	while	ago	.
and	of	course	you	can	search	to	find	the	 question 	 s 	 	that	you	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	by	using	the	same	hash	code	.
so	i	'd	like	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	design	 think 	 ing 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	can	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	,	that	it	can	help	create	new	 idea 	 s 	 	and	new	 innov 	 ations 	 	,	beyond	the	 lat 	 est 	 	high	street	 product 	 s 	 	.
to	do	that	i	think	we	have	to	take	a	more	expansive	view	of	design	,	more	like	brunel	,	less	a	domain	of	a	professional	 priest 	 hood 	 	.
and	the	first	step	is	to	start	 ask 	 ing 	 	the	right	 question 	 s 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
