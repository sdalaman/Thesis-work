peter	diamandis	:	so	 t 	 hose 	 	are	just	a	few	of	the	 clip 	 s 	 	i	 collect 	 ed 	 	over	the	last	six	 month 	 s 	 	--	could	have	 eas 	 ily 	 	 be 	 en 	 	the	last	six	 day 	 s 	 	or	the	last	six	 year 	 s 	 	.
the	point	is	that	the	news	media	 prefer 	 ential 	 ly 	 	 feed 	 s 	 	us	negative	 st 	 ories 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	what	our	 mind 	 s 	 	pay	attention	to	.
and	there	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	reason	for	that	.
every	second	of	every	day	,	our	 sense 	 s 	 	 br 	 ing 	 	in	way	too	much	data	than	we	can	possibly	process	in	our	 brain 	 s 	 	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	is	more	 import 	 ant 	 	to	us	than	 surviv 	 al 	 	,
the	first	stop	of	all	of	that	data	is	an	ancient	 s 	 liver 	 	of	the	temporal	lobe	 call 	 ed 	 	the	amygdala	.
now	the	amygdala	is	our	early	 war 	 ning 	 	 detect 	 or 	 	,	our	danger	 detect 	 or 	 	.
it	 sort 	 s 	 	and	 scour 	 s 	 	through	all	of	the	information	looking	for	 any 	 thing 	 	in	the	environment	that	might	harm	us	.
so	 give 	 n 	 	a	dozen	news	 st 	 ories 	 	,	we	will	 prefer 	 ential 	 ly 	 	look	at	the	negative	news	.
and	that	old	 news 	 paper 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	if	it	 ble 	 ed 	 s 	 	it	 lead 	 s 	 	,	``	is	 ver 	 y 	 	true	.
so	 give 	 n 	 	all	of	our	digital	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	that	are	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	all	the	negative	news	to	us	it	's	no	wonder	that	we	're	 pessim 	 istic 	 	.
it	's	no	wonder	that	people	think	that	the	world	is	 get 	 ting 	 	 wo 	 rse 	 	.
but	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	that	's	not	the	case	.
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	,	it	's	the	 distort 	 ions 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	to	us	of	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	going	on	.
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	the	tremendous	progress	we	've	made	over	the	last	century	by	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 force 	 s 	 	are	,	in	fact	,	 accele 	 rating 	 	to	a	point	that	we	have	the	potential	in	the	next	three	 decade 	 s 	 	to	create	a	world	of	abundance	.
now	i	'm	not	 say 	 ing 	 	we	do	n't	have	our	set	of	 problem 	 s 	 	--	climate	crisis	,	species	 extinct 	 ion 	 	,	water	and	energy	 short 	 age 	 	--	we	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	do	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	 human 	 s 	 	,	we	are	far	better	at	 see 	 ing 	 	the	 problem 	 s 	 	way	in	advance	,	but	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	we	knock	them	down	.
so	let	's	look	at	what	 th 	 is 	 	last	century	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	to	see	where	we	're	going	.
over	the	last	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	average	human	 life 	 span 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	more	than	 double 	 d 	 	,	average	per	capita	income	 adjust 	 ed 	 	for	 infla 	 tion 	 	around	the	world	 ha 	 s 	 	 triple 	 d 	 	.
 child 	 hood 	 	 mortal 	 ity 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	come	down	a	factor	of	10	.
add	to	that	the	cost	of	food	,	 electric 	 ity 	 	,	 transport 	 ation 	 	,	communication	have	 drop 	 ped 	 	10	to	1,000	-	fold	.
steve	pinker	 ha 	 s 	 	 show 	 ed 	 	us	that	,	in	fact	,	we	're	living	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	most	 peace 	 ful 	 	time	ever	in	human	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
and	charles	kenny	that	global	 liter 	 acy 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	from	25	percent	to	over	80	percent	in	the	last	130	 year 	 s 	 	.
we	 tru 	 ly 	 	are	living	in	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	time	.
and	 man 	 y 	 	people	forget	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	we	keep	setting	our	 expect 	 ations 	 	 high 	 er 	 	and	 high 	 er 	 	.
in	fact	,	we	 re 	 define 	 	what	poverty	 mean 	 s 	 	.
think	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	in	america	 to 	 day 	 	,	the	 major 	 ity 	 	of	people	under	the	poverty	line	still	have	 electric 	 ity 	 	,	water	,	 toilet 	 s 	 	,	 refrige 	 rator 	 s 	 	,	 tele 	 vision 	 	,	mobile	 phone 	 s 	 	,	air	 condition 	 ing 	 	and	 car 	 s 	 	.
the	 wealth 	 iest 	 	robber	 bar 	 on 	 s 	 	of	the	last	century	,	the	_UNK_	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	,	could	have	never	 dream 	 ed 	 	of	 s 	 uch 	 	 luxur 	 ies 	 	.
 under 	 pinning 	 	much	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	technology	,	and	of	late	,	 exponential 	 ly 	 	growing	 techno 	 logies 	 	.
my	good	friend	ray	kurzweil	 show 	 ed 	 	that	any	tool	that	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	an	information	technology	 jump 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	 curv 	 e 	 	,	on	moore	's	law	,	and	 experience 	 s 	 	price	performance	 doub 	 ling 	 	every	12	to	24	 month 	 s 	 	.
that	's	why	the	 cell 	 phone 	 	in	your	pocket	is	 liter 	 ally 	 	a	million	 time 	 s 	 	 cheap 	 er 	 	and	a	thousand	 time 	 s 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	than	a	 super 	 computer 	 	of	the	'70s	.
now	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	 curv 	 e 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	moore	's	law	over	the	last	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	.
i	want	you	to	notice	two	 thing 	 s 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	 curv 	 e 	 	.
number	one	,	how	smooth	it	is	--	through	good	time	and	bad	time	,	war	time	and	peace	time	,	 recess 	 ion 	 	,	 depress 	 ion 	 	and	boom	time	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	result	of	 fast 	 er 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	used	to	build	 fast 	 er 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 s 	 low 	 	for	any	of	our	grand	 challeng 	 es 	 	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	it	's	 plot 	 ted 	 	on	a	log	 curv 	 e 	 	on	the	left	,	it	's	 curv 	 ing 	 	 up 	 ward 	 s 	 	.
the	rate	at	which	the	technology	is	 get 	 ting 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	is	 it 	 self 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	.
and	on	 th 	 is 	 	 curv 	 e 	 	,	 rid 	 ing 	 	on	moore	's	law	,	are	a	set	of	 extra 	 ordinari 	 ly 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	to	all	of	us	.
cloud	computing	,	what	my	 friend 	 s 	 	at	autodesk	call	infinite	computing	;	 sensor 	 s 	 	and	 network 	 s 	 	;	 robotic 	 s 	 	;	3d	 print 	 ing 	 	,	which	is	the	ability	to	 democrat 	 ize 	 	and	 distribut 	 e 	 	 personal 	 ized 	 	production	around	the	planet	;	synthetic	biology	;	 fuel 	 s 	 	,	 vaccin 	 es 	 	and	 food 	 s 	 	;	digital	medicine	;	 nano 	 material 	 s 	 	;	and	a.i	.
i	mean	,	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	saw	the	winning	of	 jeopard 	 y 	 	by	ibm	's	watson	?
i	mean	,	that	was	epic	.
in	fact	,	i	 scour 	 ed 	 	the	 head 	 lines 	 	looking	for	the	best	 head 	 line 	 	in	a	 news 	 paper 	 	i	could	.
and	i	love	 th 	 is 	 	:	``	watson	_UNK_	human	 opponent 	 s 	 	.	``
 jeopard 	 y 	 	's	not	an	easy	game	.
it	's	about	the	nuance	of	human	language	.
and	imagine	if	you	would	a.i	.	's	like	 th 	 is 	 	on	the	cloud	 avail 	 able 	 	to	every	person	with	a	 cell 	 phone 	 	.
four	 year 	 s 	 	ago	here	at	ted	,	ray	kurzweil	and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	a	new	university	 call 	 ed 	 	 s 	 ing 	 ular 	 ity 	 	university	.
and	we	teach	our	 student 	 s 	 	all	of	these	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	and	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	how	they	can	be	used	to	solve	 human 	 ity 	 	's	grand	 challeng 	 es 	 	.
and	every	year	we	ask	them	to	start	a	company	or	a	product	or	a	service	that	can	affect	 positive 	 ly 	 	the	 live 	 s 	 	of	a	billion	people	 with 	 in 	 	a	decade	.
think	about	that	,	the	fact	that	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	a	group	of	 student 	 s 	 	can	touch	the	 live 	 s 	 	of	a	billion	people	 to 	 day 	 	.
30	 year 	 s 	 	ago	that	would	have	 sound 	 ed 	 	 ludicr 	 ous 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	we	can	point	at	 dozen 	 s 	 	of	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	that	have	 d 	 one 	 	just	that	.
when	i	think	about	creating	abundance	,	it	's	not	about	creating	a	life	of	 luxur 	 y 	 	for	 every 	 body 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	;	it	's	about	creating	a	life	of	 possibil 	 ity 	 	.
it	is	about	taking	that	which	was	scarce	and	making	it	abundant	.
you	see	,	 scar 	 city 	 	is	contextual	,	and	technology	is	a	resource	-	 liber 	 ating 	 	force	.
let	me	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	story	of	napoleon	iii	in	the	mid	-	1800s	.
he	's	the	 du 	 de 	 	on	the	left	.
he	 invit 	 ed 	 	over	to	 d 	 inner 	 	the	king	of	siam	.
all	of	napoleon	's	 troop 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	fed	with	silver	 utensil 	 s 	 	,	napoleon	 him 	 self 	 	with	gold	 utensil 	 s 	 	.
but	the	king	of	siam	,	he	was	fed	with	 a 	 lumin 	 um 	 	 utensil 	 s 	 	.
you	see	,	 a 	 lumin 	 um 	 	was	the	most	 valu 	 able 	 	metal	on	the	planet	,	worth	more	than	gold	and	platinum	.
it	's	the	reason	that	the	tip	of	the	washington	monument	is	made	of	 a 	 lumin 	 um 	 	.
you	see	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	 a 	 lumin 	 um 	 	is	8.3	percent	of	the	earth	by	mass	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	come	 a 	 s 	 	a	 pur 	 e 	 	metal	.
it	's	all	bound	by	oxygen	and	 silica 	 tes 	 	.
but	then	the	technology	of	_UNK_	came	 a 	 long 	 	and	 liter 	 ally 	 	made	 a 	 lumin 	 um 	 	so	cheap	that	we	use	it	with	throw	-	away	 ment 	 ality 	 	.
so	let	's	project	 th 	 is 	 	 analog 	 y 	 	going	forward	.
we	think	about	energy	 scar 	 city 	 	.
 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	we	are	on	a	planet	that	is	 bath 	 ed 	 	with	5,000	 time 	 s 	 	more	energy	than	we	use	in	a	year	.
16	 tera 	 watt 	 s 	 	of	energy	 hit 	 s 	 	the	earth	's	surface	every	88	 minute 	 s 	 	.
it	's	not	about	 be 	 ing 	 	scarce	,	it	's	about	 access 	 ibility 	 	.
and	there	's	good	news	here	.
for	the	first	time	,	 th 	 is 	 	year	the	cost	of	solar	-	generated	 electric 	 ity 	 	is	50	percent	that	of	 dies 	 el 	 	-	generated	 electric 	 ity 	 	in	india	--	8.8	 rupee 	 s 	 	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	17	 rupee 	 s 	 	.
the	cost	of	solar	 drop 	 ped 	 	50	percent	last	year	.
last	month	,	mit	put	out	a	 stud 	 y 	 	 show 	 ing 	 	that	by	the	end	of	 th 	 is 	 	decade	,	in	the	 s 	 un 	 ny 	 	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	solar	 electric 	 ity 	 	will	be	six	 cent 	 s 	 	a	kilowatt	hour	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	15	 cent 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	national	average	.
and	if	we	have	abundant	energy	,	we	 al 	 so 	 	have	abundant	water	.
now	we	talk	about	water	 war 	 s 	 	.
do	you	remember	when	carl	sagan	 turn 	 ed 	 	the	voyager	 space 	 craft 	 	back	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	earth	,	in	1990	after	it	just	 pass 	 ed 	 	saturn	?
he	took	a	famous	photo	.	what	was	it	 call 	 ed 	 	?
``	a	pale	blue	dot	.	``
 be 	 cause 	 	we	live	on	a	water	planet	.
we	live	on	a	planet	70	percent	 cover 	 ed 	 	by	water	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	_UNK_	percent	is	 salt 	 water 	 	,	two	percent	is	ice	,	and	we	fight	over	a	half	a	percent	of	the	water	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	,	but	here	too	there	is	hope	.
and	there	is	technology	coming	 on 	 line 	 	,	not	10	,	20	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	,	right	now	.
there	's	 nano 	 technology 	 	coming	on	,	 nano 	 material 	 s 	 	.
and	the	conversation	i	had	with	dean	kamen	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	one	of	the	great	diy	 innov 	 ators 	 	,	i	'd	like	to	share	with	you	--	he	 g 	 ave 	 	me	 per 	 mission 	 	to	do	so	--	his	technology	 call 	 ed 	 	 s 	 ling 	 shot 	 	that	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	may	have	heard	of	,	it	is	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	small	dorm	room	 refrige 	 rator 	 	.
it	's	able	to	generate	a	thousand	 liter 	 s 	 	of	clean	 drink 	 ing 	 	water	a	day	out	of	any	source	--	 salt 	 water 	 	,	 pollute 	 d 	 	water	,	latrine	--	at	less	than	two	 cent 	 s 	 	a	liter	.
the	 chair 	 man 	 	of	coca	-	 col 	 a 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	just	 agree 	 d 	 	to	do	a	major	test	of	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 unit 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	.
and	if	that	 pan 	 s 	 	out	,	which	i	have	every	confidence	it	will	,	coca	-	 col 	 a 	 	will	deploy	 th 	 is 	 	 global 	 ly 	 	to	206	 count 	 ries 	 	around	the	planet	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	kind	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	 empower 	 ed 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	technology	,	that	 exist 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	 cell 	 phone 	 s 	 	.
my	 good 	 ness 	 	,	we	're	going	to	hit	70	percent	 penet 	 ration 	 	of	 cell 	 phone 	 s 	 	in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	by	the	end	of	2013	.
think	about	it	,	that	a	masai	warrior	on	a	 cell 	 phone 	 	in	the	middle	of	kenya	 ha 	 s 	 	better	mobile	_UNK_	than	 p 	 resident 	 	reagan	did	25	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	if	they	're	on	a	 smart 	 phone 	 	on	google	,	they	've	got	access	to	more	knowledge	and	information	than	 p 	 resident 	 	clinton	did	15	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
they	're	living	in	a	world	of	information	and	communication	abundance	that	no	one	could	have	ever	 predict 	 ed 	 	.
better	than	that	,	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	and	i	 s 	 pent 	 	 ten 	 s 	 	and	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	for	--	gps	,	hd	video	and	still	 image 	 s 	 	,	 lib 	 r 	 aries 	 	of	 book 	 s 	 	and	music	,	medical	 diagnos 	 tic 	 	technology	--	are	now	 liter 	 ally 	 	_UNK_	and	_UNK_	 in 	 to 	 	your	 cell 	 phone 	 	.
 prob 	 ably 	 	the	best	part	of	it	is	what	's	coming	down	the	pike	in	health	.
last	month	,	i	had	the	pleasure	of	 announc 	 ing 	 	with	qualcomm	 found 	 ation 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	$	10	million	qualcomm	 tric 	 order 	 	x	prize	.
we	're	 challeng 	 ing 	 	 team 	 s 	 	around	the	world	to	 bas 	 ically 	 	combine	these	 techno 	 logies 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	mobile	 de 	 vice 	 	that	you	can	speak	to	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	got	a.i	.	,	you	can	cough	on	it	,	you	can	do	a	finger	blood	prick	.
and	to	win	,	it	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	able	to	 diagnos 	 e 	 	you	better	than	a	team	of	board	-	 cert 	 ified 	 	 doctor 	 s 	 	.
so	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	imagine	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	in	the	middle	of	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	where	there	are	no	 doctor 	 s 	 	,	25	percent	of	the	disease	burden	and	1.3	percent	of	the	health	care	 work 	 ers 	 	.
when	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	 sequence 	 s 	 	an	rna	or	dna	virus	that	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 recogn 	 ize 	 	,	it	 call 	 s 	 	the	cdc	and	 prevent 	 s 	 	the	 pan 	 demic 	 	from	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	the	first	place	.
but	here	,	here	is	the	 big 	 gest 	 	force	for	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	about	a	world	of	abundance	.
i	call	it	the	 ris 	 ing 	 	billion	.
so	the	white	lines	here	are	population	.
we	just	 pass 	 ed 	 	the	seven	billion	mark	on	earth	.
and	by	the	way	,	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 protect 	 ion 	 	against	a	population	explosion	is	making	the	world	educated	and	 health 	 y 	 	.
in	2010	,	we	had	just	short	of	two	billion	people	 on 	 line 	 	,	 connect 	 ed 	 	.
by	2020	,	that	's	going	from	two	billion	to	five	billion	 inter 	 net 	 	 user 	 s 	 	.
three	billion	new	 mind 	 s 	 	who	have	never	 be 	 en 	 	heard	from	before	are	 connect 	 ing 	 	to	the	global	conversation	.
what	will	these	people	want	?
what	will	they	 consum 	 e 	 	?	what	will	they	 desir 	 e 	 	?
and	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 hav 	 ing 	 	economic	shutdown	,	we	're	about	to	have	the	 big 	 gest 	 	economic	 inject 	 ion 	 	ever	.
these	people	represent	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 trillion 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	 inject 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	global	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
and	they	will	get	 health 	 ier 	 	by	using	the	 tric 	 order 	 	,	and	they	'll	 be 	 come 	 	better	educated	by	using	the	khan	academy	,	and	by	 liter 	 ally 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	use	3d	 print 	 ing 	 	and	infinite	computing	[	 be 	 come 	 	]	more	productive	than	ever	before	.
so	what	could	three	billion	 ris 	 ing 	 	,	 health 	 y 	 	,	educated	,	productive	 member 	 s 	 	of	 human 	 ity 	 	 br 	 ing 	 	to	us	?
how	about	a	set	of	 voice 	 s 	 	that	have	never	 be 	 en 	 	heard	from	before	.
what	about	giving	the	 oppress 	 ed 	 	,	 where 	 ver 	 	they	might	be	,	the	voice	to	be	heard	and	the	voice	to	act	for	the	first	time	ever	?
what	will	these	three	billion	people	 br 	 ing 	 	?
what	about	 con 	 trib 	 ution 	 s 	 	we	ca	n't	even	predict	?
the	one	thing	i	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	at	the	x	prize	is	that	small	 team 	 s 	 	driven	by	 the 	 ir 	 	 pass 	 ion 	 	with	a	clear	focus	can	do	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	that	large	 corporation 	 s 	 	and	 government 	 s 	 	could	 on 	 ly 	 	do	in	the	past	.
let	me	share	and	close	with	a	story	that	 re 	 ally 	 	got	me	 excit 	 ed 	 	.
there	is	a	program	that	some	of	you	might	have	heard	of	.
it	's	a	game	 call 	 ed 	 	foldit	.
it	came	out	of	the	university	of	washington	in	seattle	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	game	where	 individual 	 s 	 	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	take	a	sequence	of	 am 	 ino 	 	 acid 	 s 	 	and	figure	out	how	the	protein	is	going	to	fold	.
and	how	it	 fold 	 s 	 	_UNK_	 it 	 s 	 	structure	and	 it 	 s 	 	 functional 	 ity 	 	.
and	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	for	research	in	medicine	.
and	up	 un 	 til 	 	now	,	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	 super 	 computer 	 	problem	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	game	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 play 	 ed 	 	by	university	 professor 	 s 	 	and	so	forth	.
and	it	's	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	came	 on 	 line 	 	and	 start 	 ed 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	it	.
and	it	 show 	 ed 	 	that	,	in	fact	,	 to 	 day 	 	,	the	human	pattern	 re 	 cognition 	 	 machine 	 ry 	 	is	better	at	 fold 	 ing 	 	 protein 	 s 	 	than	the	best	 computer 	 s 	 	.
and	when	these	 individual 	 s 	 	went	and	 look 	 ed 	 	at	who	was	the	best	protein	 fold 	 er 	 	in	the	world	,	it	was	n't	an	mit	professor	,	it	was	n't	a	caltech	student	,	it	was	a	person	from	england	,	from	manchester	,	a	woman	who	,	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	day	,	was	an	 ex 	 ecutive 	 	 assist 	 ant 	 	at	a	rehab	clinic	and	,	at	night	,	was	the	world	's	best	protein	 fold 	 er 	 	.
 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	what	 give 	 s 	 	me	tremendous	confidence	in	the	future	is	the	fact	that	we	are	now	more	 empower 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	to	take	on	the	grand	 challeng 	 es 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	planet	.
we	have	the	 tool 	 s 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	exponential	technology	.
we	have	the	 pass 	 ion 	 	of	the	diy	 innov 	 ator 	 	.
we	have	the	capital	of	the	techno	-	 philanthro 	 pist 	 	.
and	we	have	three	billion	new	 mind 	 s 	 	coming	 on 	 line 	 	to	work	with	us	to	solve	the	grand	 challeng 	 es 	 	,	to	do	that	which	we	must	do	.
we	are	living	 in 	 to 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 decade 	 s 	 	 a 	 head 	 	.
thank	you	.
