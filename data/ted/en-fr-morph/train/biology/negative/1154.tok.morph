the	story	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	share	with	you	 to 	 day 	 	is	my	 challeng 	 e 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	iranian	artist	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	iranian	woman	artist	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	iranian	woman	artist	living	in	 ex 	 ile 	 	.
well	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 plus 	 es 	 	and	 minus 	 es 	 	.
on	the	dark	side	,	 politic 	 s 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	seem	to	 es 	 cape 	 	people	like	me	.
every	iranian	artist	,	in	one	form	or	 an 	 other 	 	,	is	 politic 	 al 	 	.
 politic 	 s 	 	have	defined	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
if	you	're	living	in	iran	,	you	're	facing	 censor 	 ship 	 	,	 harass 	 ment 	 	,	arrest	,	torture	--	at	 time 	 s 	 	,	 exec 	 ution 	 	.
if	you	're	living	 out 	 side 	 	like	me	,	you	're	 face 	 d 	 	with	life	in	 ex 	 ile 	 	--	the	pain	of	the	 long 	 ing 	 	and	the	 separat 	 ion 	 	from	your	 love 	 d 	 	 one 	 s 	 	and	your	family	.
 there 	 fore 	 	,	we	do	n't	find	the	moral	,	 emotion 	 al 	 	,	 psycho 	 logical 	 	and	 politic 	 al 	 	space	to	distance	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	from	the	 re 	 ality 	 	of	social	 respons 	 ibility 	 	.
 odd 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	an	artist	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 my 	 self 	 	 find 	 s 	 	 her 	 self 	 	 al 	 so 	 	in	the	position	of	 be 	 ing 	 	the	voice	,	the	speaker	of	my	people	,	even	if	i	have	,	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	no	access	to	my	own	country	.
 al 	 so 	 	,	people	like	 my 	 self 	 	,	we	're	 fight 	 ing 	 	two	 battle 	 s 	 	on	different	 ground 	 s 	 	.
we	're	 be 	 ing 	 	critical	of	the	west	,	the	 per 	 ception 	 	of	the	west	about	our	 ident 	 ity 	 	--	about	the	image	that	is	 construct 	 ed 	 	about	us	,	about	our	women	,	about	our	 politic 	 s 	 	,	about	our	 relig 	 ion 	 	.
we	are	there	to	take	 pri 	 de 	 	and	insist	on	respect	.
and	at	the	same	time	,	we	're	 fight 	 ing 	 	 an 	 other 	 	battle	.
that	is	our	regime	,	our	government	--	our	 atro 	 c 	 ious 	 	government	,	[	that	]	 ha 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	every	crime	in	order	to	stay	in	power	.
our	 artist 	 s 	 	are	at	risk	.
we	are	in	a	position	of	danger	.
we	pose	a	threat	to	the	order	of	the	government	.
but	 iron 	 ically 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 empower 	 ed 	 	all	of	us	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	are	 consider 	 ed 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 artist 	 s 	 	,	central	to	the	cultural	,	 politic 	 al 	 	,	social	 dis 	 course 	 	in	iran	.
we	are	there	to	inspire	,	to	 provok 	 e 	 	,	to	mobilize	,	to	 br 	 ing 	 	hope	to	our	people	.
we	are	the	 report 	 ers 	 	of	our	people	,	and	are	 communicator 	 s 	 	to	the	 out 	 side 	 	world	.
art	is	our	weapon	.
culture	is	a	form	of	 resist 	 ance 	 	.
i	 en 	 vy 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	the	 artist 	 s 	 	of	the	west	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 free 	 dom 	 	of	 express 	 ion 	 	.	for	the	fact	that	they	can	distance	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	from	the	question	of	 politic 	 s 	 	.	from	the	fact	that	they	are	 on 	 ly 	 	 serv 	 ing 	 	one	audience	,	 main 	 ly 	 	the	western	culture	.
but	 al 	 so 	 	,	i	worry	about	the	west	,	 be 	 cause 	 	often	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	western	world	that	we	have	,	culture	 risk 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	a	form	of	 entertain 	 ment 	 	.
our	people	depend	on	our	 artist 	 s 	 	,	and	culture	is	beyond	communication	.
my	journey	 a 	 s 	 	an	artist	 start 	 ed 	 	from	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	personal	place	.
i	did	not	start	to	make	social	 comment 	 ary 	 	about	my	country	.
the	first	one	that	you	see	in	front	of	you	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	when	i	first	 return 	 ed 	 	to	iran	after	 be 	 ing 	 	 separat 	 ed 	 	for	a	good	12	 year 	 s 	 	.
it	was	after	the	islamic	revolution	of	1979	.
while	i	was	absent	from	iran	,	the	islamic	revolution	had	 descend 	 ed 	 	on	iran	and	had	 entire 	 ly 	 	 transform 	 ed 	 	the	country	from	persian	to	the	islamic	culture	.
i	came	 main 	 ly 	 	to	be	 re 	 unit 	 ed 	 	with	my	family	and	to	 re 	 connect 	 	in	a	way	that	i	found	my	place	in	the	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
but	 in 	 stead 	 	,	i	found	a	country	that	was	 total 	 ly 	 	 ideo 	 logical 	 	and	that	i	did	n't	 recogn 	 ize 	 	 any 	 more 	 	.
more	so	,	i	 be 	 came 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	was	facing	my	own	personal	 dilemma 	 s 	 	and	 question 	 s 	 	,	i	 be 	 came 	 	 immers 	 ed 	 	in	the	 stud 	 y 	 	of	the	islamic	revolution	--	how	,	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	it	had	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 transform 	 ed 	 	the	 live 	 s 	 	of	iranian	women	.
i	found	the	subject	of	iranian	women	 immense 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	in	the	way	the	women	of	iran	,	 historic 	 ally 	 	,	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	 em 	 body 	 	the	 politic 	 al 	 	 transform 	 ation 	 	.
so	in	a	way	,	by	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	a	woman	,	you	can	read	the	structure	and	the	 ideo 	 logy 	 	of	the	country	.
so	i	made	a	group	of	work	that	at	once	 face 	 d 	 	my	own	personal	 question 	 s 	 	in	life	,	and	yet	it	 br 	 ought 	 	my	work	 in 	 to 	 	a	 large 	 r 	 	 dis 	 course 	 	--	the	subject	of	 martyr 	 dom 	 	,	the	question	of	 t 	 hose 	 	who	 will 	 ing 	 ly 	 	stand	in	that	 intersect 	 ion 	 	of	love	of	god	,	faith	,	but	violence	and	crime	and	 cruel 	 ty 	 	.
for	me	,	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 came 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
and	yet	,	i	had	an	 un 	 usual 	 	position	 to 	 ward 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	was	an	 out 	 sider 	 	who	had	come	back	to	iran	to	find	my	place	,	but	i	was	not	in	a	position	to	be	critical	of	the	government	or	the	 ideo 	 logy 	 	of	the	islamic	revolution	.
 th 	 is 	 	 change 	 d 	 	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	i	found	my	voice	and	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	did	n't	know	i	would	discover	.
so	my	art	 be 	 came 	 	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	more	critical	.
my	knife	 be 	 came 	 	a	little	 sharp 	 er 	 	.
and	i	fell	 in 	 to 	 	a	life	in	 ex 	 ile 	 	.
i	am	a	 nomad 	 ic 	 	artist	.
i	work	in	morocco	,	in	 tur 	 key 	 	,	in	mexico	.
i	go	 every 	 where 	 	to	make	 believ 	 e 	 	it	's	iran	.
now	i	am	making	 film 	 s 	 	.
last	year	,	i	 finish 	 ed 	 	a	film	 call 	 ed 	 	``	women	 with 	 out 	 	men	.	``
``	women	 with 	 out 	 	men	``	 return 	 s 	 	to	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	but	 an 	 other 	 	part	of	our	iranian	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
it	 go 	 es 	 	to	1953	when	american	cia	 exercis 	 ed 	 	a	coup	and	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	a	 democrat 	 ically 	 	 elect 	 ed 	 	 lead 	 er 	 	,	dr.	mossadegh	.
the	book	is	written	by	an	iranian	woman	,	shahrnush	parsipur	.
it	's	a	 magic 	 al 	 	 re 	 alist 	 	novel	.
 th 	 is 	 	book	is	 bann 	 ed 	 	,	and	she	 s 	 pent 	 	five	 year 	 s 	 	in	 pri 	 son 	 	.
my	obsession	with	 th 	 is 	 	book	,	and	the	reason	i	made	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	film	,	is	 be 	 cause 	 	it	at	once	was	 address 	 ing 	 	the	question	of	 be 	 ing 	 	a	female	--	 tradition 	 ally 	 	,	 historic 	 ally 	 	in	iran	--	and	the	question	of	four	women	who	are	all	looking	for	an	idea	of	change	,	 free 	 dom 	 	and	 demo 	 cracy 	 	--	while	the	country	of	iran	,	 equal 	 ly 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	if	 an 	 other 	 	character	,	 al 	 so 	 	 struggle 	 d 	 	for	an	idea	of	 free 	 dom 	 	and	 demo 	 cracy 	 	and	 in 	 depend 	 ence 	 	from	the	foreign	 intervention 	 s 	 	.
i	made	 th 	 is 	 	film	 be 	 cause 	 	i	felt	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	for	it	to	speak	to	the	westerners	about	our	 histo 	 ry 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	country	.
that	all	of	you	seem	to	remember	iran	after	the	islamic	revolution	.
that	iran	was	once	a	secular	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	and	we	had	 demo 	 cracy 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 demo 	 cracy 	 	was	 stole 	 n 	 	from	us	by	the	american	government	,	by	the	british	government	.
 th 	 is 	 	film	 al 	 so 	 	 speak 	 s 	 	to	the	iranian	people	in	 ask 	 ing 	 	them	to	return	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	and	look	at	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	before	they	 we 	 re 	 	so	islamicized	--	in	the	way	we	 look 	 ed 	 	,	in	the	way	we	 play 	 ed 	 	music	,	in	the	way	we	had	intellectual	life	.
and	most	of	all	,	in	the	way	that	we	 f 	 ought 	 	for	 demo 	 cracy 	 	.
these	are	some	of	the	 shot 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	from	my	film	.
these	are	some	of	the	 image 	 s 	 	of	the	coup	.
and	we	made	 th 	 is 	 	film	in	casablanca	,	 re 	 creating 	 	all	the	 shot 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	film	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	find	a	balance	between	 tell 	 ing 	 	a	 politic 	 al 	 	story	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	a	 femin 	 ine 	 	story	.
 be 	 ing 	 	a	visual	artist	,	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	i	am	 fore 	 most 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	to	make	art	--	to	make	art	that	 transcend 	 s 	 	 politic 	 s 	 	,	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	the	question	of	 femin 	 ism 	 	,	and	 be 	 come 	 	an	 import 	 ant 	 	,	 time 	 less 	 	,	universal	work	of	art	.
the	 challeng 	 e 	 	i	have	is	how	to	do	that	.	how	to	tell	a	 politic 	 al 	 	story	but	an	 alle 	 gor 	 ical 	 	story	.	how	to	move	you	with	your	 emotion 	 s 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	make	your	mind	work	.
these	are	some	of	the	 image 	 s 	 	and	the	 character 	 s 	 	of	the	film	.
now	 come 	 s 	 	the	green	 move 	 ment 	 	--	the	summer	of	2009	,	 a 	 s 	 	my	film	is	released	--	the	 up 	 ris 	 ing 	 	 begin 	 s 	 	in	the	 street 	 s 	 	of	tehran	.
what	is	 un 	 believ 	 ably 	 	 iron 	 ic 	 	is	the	period	that	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	depict	in	the	film	,	the	cry	for	 demo 	 cracy 	 	and	social	justice	,	 repeat 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	now	 aga 	 in 	 	in	tehran	.
the	green	 move 	 ment 	 	 significant 	 ly 	 	inspired	the	world	.
it	 br 	 ought 	 	a	lot	of	attention	to	all	 t 	 hose 	 	iranians	who	stand	for	 bas 	 ic 	 	human	 right 	 s 	 	and	struggle	for	 demo 	 cracy 	 	.
what	was	most	significant	for	me	was	,	once	 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	presence	of	the	women	.
they	're	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 inspiration 	 al 	 	for	me	.
if	in	the	islamic	revolution	,	the	 image 	 s 	 	of	the	woman	 port 	 ray 	 ed 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 sub 	 mis 	 s 	 ive 	 	and	did	n't	have	a	voice	,	now	we	saw	a	new	idea	of	 femin 	 ism 	 	in	the	 street 	 s 	 	of	tehran	--	women	who	 we 	 re 	 	educated	,	forward	 think 	 ing 	 	,	non	-	 tradition 	 al 	 	,	 sexual 	 ly 	 	open	,	 fear 	 less 	 	and	 serious 	 ly 	 	feminist	.
these	women	and	 t 	 hose 	 	young	men	 unit 	 ed 	 	iranians	 a 	 cross 	 	the	world	,	 in 	 side 	 	and	 out 	 side 	 	.
i	then	 discover 	 ed 	 	why	i	take	so	much	inspiration	from	iranian	women	.
that	,	under	all	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	,	they	have	 push 	 ed 	 	the	 bound 	 ary 	 	.
they	have	 confront 	 ed 	 	the	 author 	 ity 	 	.
they	have	broken	every	rule	in	the	 small 	 est 	 	and	the	 big 	 gest 	 	way	.
and	once	 aga 	 in 	 	,	they	 prov 	 ed 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
i	stand	here	to	say	that	iranian	women	have	found	a	new	voice	,	and	 the 	 ir 	 	voice	is	giving	me	my	voice	.
and	it	's	a	great	honor	to	be	an	iranian	woman	and	an	iranian	artist	,	even	if	i	have	to	 oper 	 ate 	 	in	the	west	 on 	 ly 	 	for	now	.
thank	you	so	much	.
