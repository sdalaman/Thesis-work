for	me	,	 th 	 is 	 	story	 begin 	 s 	 	about	15	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	when	i	was	a	 ho 	 spice 	 	doctor	at	the	university	of	chicago	.
and	i	was	taking	care	of	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	 dy 	 ing 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	in	the	south	side	of	chicago	.
and	i	was	 observ 	 ing 	 	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	people	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	over	the	course	of	 the 	 ir 	 	terminal	 ill 	 ness 	 	.
and	in	my	lab	,	i	was	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	the	 widow 	 er 	 	effect	,	which	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	old	idea	in	the	social	 science 	 s 	 	,	going	back	150	 year 	 s 	 	,	known	 a 	 s 	 	``	 dy 	 ing 	 	of	a	broken	heart	.	``
so	,	when	i	die	,	my	wife	's	risk	of	death	can	double	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	in	the	first	year	.
and	i	had	gone	to	take	care	of	one	 part 	 icular 	 	patient	,	a	woman	who	was	 dy 	 ing 	 	of	 de 	 ment 	 ia 	 	.
and	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	 un 	 like 	 	 th 	 is 	 	couple	,	she	was	 be 	 ing 	 	 car 	 ed 	 	for	by	her	daughter	.
and	the	daughter	was	 exhaust 	 ed 	 	from	 car 	 ing 	 	for	her	mother	.
and	the	daughter	's	husband	,	he	 al 	 so 	 	was	sick	from	his	wife	's	 exhaust 	 ion 	 	.
and	i	was	 driv 	 ing 	 	home	one	day	,	and	i	get	a	phone	call	from	the	husband	's	friend	,	 call 	 ing 	 	me	 be 	 cause 	 	he	was	 depress 	 ed 	 	about	what	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	to	his	friend	.
so	here	i	get	 th 	 is 	 	call	from	 th 	 is 	 	random	guy	that	's	 hav 	 ing 	 	an	experience	that	's	 be 	 ing 	 	 influence 	 d 	 	by	people	at	some	social	distance	.
and	so	i	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 real 	 ized 	 	two	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 thing 	 s 	 	:
first	,	the	 widow 	 hood 	 	effect	was	not	 restrict 	 ed 	 	to	 husband 	 s 	 	and	wives	.
and	second	,	it	was	not	 restrict 	 ed 	 	to	 pair 	 s 	 	of	people	.
and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	see	the	world	in	a	whole	new	way	,	like	 pair 	 s 	 	of	people	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	each	other	.
and	then	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	these	 individual 	 s 	 	would	be	 connect 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 four 	 some 	 s 	 	with	other	 pair 	 s 	 	of	people	 near 	 by 	 	.
and	then	,	in	fact	,	these	people	 we 	 re 	 	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	in	other	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 relationship 	 s 	 	:	marriage	and	 s 	 po 	 usal 	 	and	 friend 	 ship 	 	and	other	 sort 	 s 	 	of	ties	.
and	that	,	in	fact	,	these	 connect 	 ions 	 	 we 	 re 	 	vast	and	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	all	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	broad	set	of	 connect 	 ions 	 	with	each	other	.
so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	see	the	world	in	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	new	way	and	i	 be 	 came 	 	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	 be 	 came 	 	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	how	it	might	be	that	we	're	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	in	these	social	 network 	 s 	 	,	and	how	they	affect	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
so	,	social	 network 	 s 	 	are	these	 intric 	 ate 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	of	 beaut 	 y 	 	,	and	they	're	so	elaborate	and	so	complex	and	so	 ubiqu 	 it 	 ous 	 	,	in	fact	,	that	one	 ha 	 s 	 	to	ask	what	purpose	they	serve	.
why	are	we	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	in	social	 network 	 s 	 	?
i	mean	,	how	do	they	form	?	how	do	they	 oper 	 ate 	 	?
and	how	do	they	effect	us	?
so	my	first	 top 	 ic 	 	with	respect	to	 th 	 is 	 	,	was	not	death	,	but	 obes 	 ity 	 	.
it	had	 be 	 come 	 	 trend 	 y 	 	to	speak	about	the	``	 obes 	 ity 	 	 epi 	 demic 	 	.	``
and	,	 a 	 long 	 	with	my	 collabor 	 ator 	 	,	james	fowler	,	we	 beg 	 an 	 	to	wonder	 whet 	 her 	 	 obes 	 ity 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	was	 epi 	 demic 	 	and	could	it	spread	from	person	to	person	like	the	four	people	i	 discuss 	 ed 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	slide	of	some	of	our	 initi 	 al 	 	 result 	 s 	 	.
it	's	2,200	people	in	the	year	2000	.
every	dot	is	a	person	.	we	make	the	dot	 s 	 ize 	 	 proportion 	 al 	 	to	people	's	body	 s 	 ize 	 	;
so	 big 	 ger 	 	 dot 	 s 	 	are	 big 	 ger 	 	people	.
in	 add 	 ition 	 	,	if	your	body	 s 	 ize 	 	,	if	your	bmi	,	your	body	mass	index	,	is	above	30	--	if	you	're	 clinic 	 ally 	 	 obes 	 e 	 	--	we	 al 	 so 	 	 color 	 ed 	 	the	 dot 	 s 	 	yellow	.
so	,	if	you	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	image	,	right	away	you	might	be	able	to	see	that	there	are	 cluster 	 s 	 	of	 obes 	 e 	 	and	non	-	 obes 	 e 	 	people	in	the	image	.
but	the	visual	 complex 	 ity 	 	is	still	 ver 	 y 	 	high	.
it	's	not	obvious	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	's	going	on	.
in	 add 	 ition 	 	,	some	 question 	 s 	 	are	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	raised	:
how	much	 cluster 	 ing 	 	is	there	?
is	there	more	 cluster 	 ing 	 	than	would	be	due	to	chance	 al 	 one 	 	?
how	big	are	the	 cluster 	 s 	 	?	how	far	do	they	reach	?
and	,	most	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	what	 cause 	 s 	 	the	 cluster 	 s 	 	?
so	we	did	some	 mathematic 	 s 	 	to	 stud 	 y 	 	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	these	 cluster 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	here	 show 	 s 	 	,	on	the	y	-	axis	,	the	 in 	 crease 	 	in	the	 prob 	 ability 	 	that	a	person	is	 obes 	 e 	 	 give 	 n 	 	that	a	social	contact	of	 the 	 ir 	 s 	 	is	 obes 	 e 	 
and	,	on	the	x	-	axis	,	the	 degree 	 s 	 	of	 separat 	 ion 	 	between	the	two	people	.
on	the	far	left	,	you	see	the	 pur 	 ple 	 	line	.
it	 say 	 s 	 	that	,	if	your	 friend 	 s 	 	are	 obes 	 e 	 	,	your	risk	of	 obes 	 ity 	 	is	45	percent	 high 	 er 	 	.
and	the	next	bar	over	,	the	[	red	]	line	,	 say 	 s 	 	if	your	friend	's	 friend 	 s 	 	are	 obes 	 e 	 	,	your	risk	of	 obes 	 ity 	 	is	25	percent	 high 	 er 	 	.
and	then	the	next	line	over	 say 	 s 	 	if	your	friend	's	friend	's	friend	,	 some 	 one 	 	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	do	n't	even	know	,	is	 obes 	 e 	 	,	your	risk	of	 obes 	 ity 	 	is	10	percent	 high 	 er 	 	.
and	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	when	you	get	to	your	friend	's	friend	's	friend	's	 friend 	 s 	 	that	there	's	no	 long 	 er 	 	a	relationship	between	that	person	's	body	 s 	 ize 	 	and	your	own	body	 s 	 ize 	 	.
well	,	what	might	be	 caus 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 cluster 	 ing 	 	?
there	are	at	 l 	 east 	 	three	 possibil 	 ities 	 	:
one	 possibil 	 ity 	 	is	that	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	gain	weight	,	it	 cause 	 s 	 	you	to	gain	weight	.	a	kind	of	 indu 	 ction 	 	,	a	kind	of	spread	from	person	to	person	.
 an 	 other 	 	 possibil 	 ity 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	obvious	,	is	 homo 	 phil 	 y 	 	,	or	,	 bird 	 s 	 	of	a	feather	flock	together	;
here	,	i	form	my	tie	to	you	 be 	 cause 	 	you	and	i	share	a	similar	body	 s 	 ize 	 	.
and	the	last	 possibil 	 ity 	 	is	what	is	known	 a 	 s 	 	 con 	 found 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 con 	 found 	 s 	 	our	ability	to	figure	out	what	's	going	on	.
and	here	,	the	idea	is	not	that	my	weight	gain	is	 caus 	 ing 	 	your	weight	gain	,	nor	that	i	 prefer 	 ential 	 ly 	 	form	a	tie	with	you	 be 	 cause 	 	you	and	i	share	the	same	body	 s 	 ize 	 	,	but	 ra 	 ther 	 	that	we	share	a	common	 expo 	 s 	 ure 	 	to	 some 	 thing 	 	,	like	a	health	club	that	 make 	 s 	 	us	both	lose	weight	at	the	same	time	.
when	we	 stud 	 ied 	 	these	data	,	we	found	evidence	for	all	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	for	 indu 	 ction 	 	.
and	we	found	that	if	your	friend	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 obes 	 e 	 	,	it	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	your	risk	of	 obes 	 ity 	 	by	about	57	percent	in	the	same	 give 	 n 	 	time	period	.
there	can	be	 man 	 y 	 	 mechan 	 ism 	 s 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	effect	:
one	 possibil 	 ity 	 	is	that	your	 friend 	 s 	 	say	to	you	 some 	 thing 	 	like	--	you	know	,	they	adopt	a	behavior	that	 spread 	 s 	 	to	you	--	like	,	they	say	,	``	let	's	go	have	 muffin 	 s 	 	and	beer	,	``	which	is	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	combination	.	but	you	adopt	that	combination	,	and	then	you	start	 gain 	 ing 	 	weight	like	them	.
 an 	 other 	 	more	subtle	 possibil 	 ity 	 	is	that	they	start	 gain 	 ing 	 	weight	,	and	it	 change 	 s 	 	your	 idea 	 s 	 	of	what	an	 accept 	 able 	 	body	 s 	 ize 	 	is	.
here	,	what	's	 spread 	 ing 	 	from	person	to	person	is	not	a	behavior	,	but	 ra 	 ther 	 	a	norm	:
an	idea	is	 spread 	 ing 	 	.
now	,	 head 	 line 	 	 writer 	 s 	 	had	a	field	day	with	our	 stud 	 ies 	 	.
i	think	the	 head 	 line 	 	in	the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	was	,	``	are	you	 pack 	 ing 	 	it	on	?
blame	your	fat	 friend 	 s 	 	.	``
what	was	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	us	is	that	the	european	 head 	 line 	 	 writer 	 s 	 	had	a	different	take	:	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	are	your	 friend 	 s 	 	 gain 	 ing 	 	weight	?	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	you	are	to	blame	.	``
and	we	thought	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	comment	on	america	,	and	a	kind	of	self	-	 serv 	 ing 	 	,	``	not	my	 respons 	 ibility 	 	``	kind	of	 phenomen 	 on 	 	.
now	,	i	want	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	:	we	do	not	think	our	work	should	or	could	 just 	 ify 	 	prejudice	against	people	of	one	or	 an 	 other 	 	body	 s 	 ize 	 	at	all	.
our	next	 question 	 s 	 	was	:	could	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 visual 	 ize 	 	 th 	 is 	 	spread	?
was	weight	gain	in	one	person	 actual 	 ly 	 	 spread 	 ing 	 	to	weight	gain	in	 an 	 other 	 	person	?
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	 complic 	 ated 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 need 	 ed 	 	to	take	 in 	 to 	 	account	the	fact	that	the	network	structure	,	the	 architect 	 ure 	 	of	the	ties	,	was	changing	 a 	 cross 	 	time	.
in	 add 	 ition 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 obes 	 ity 	 	is	not	a	 uni 	 centric 	 	 epi 	 demic 	 	,	there	's	not	a	patient	zero	of	the	 obes 	 ity 	 	 epi 	 demic 	 	--	if	we	find	that	guy	,	there	was	a	spread	of	 obes 	 ity 	 	out	from	him	--	it	's	a	 multi 	 centric 	 	 epi 	 demic 	 	.
 lot 	 s 	 	of	people	are	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	at	the	same	time	.
and	i	'm	about	to	show	you	a	30	second	video	 anim 	 ation 	 	that	took	me	and	james	five	 year 	 s 	 	of	our	 live 	 s 	 	to	do	.
so	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	every	dot	is	a	person	.
every	tie	between	them	is	a	relationship	.
we	're	going	to	put	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 to 	 	motion	now	,	taking	 dai 	 ly 	 	 cut 	 s 	 	through	the	network	for	about	30	 year 	 s 	 	.
the	dot	 s 	 ize 	 s 	 	are	going	to	grow	,
you	're	going	to	see	a	sea	of	yellow	take	over	.
you	're	going	to	see	people	be	born	and	die	--	 dot 	 s 	 	will	appear	and	disappear	--
ties	will	form	and	break	,	 marriage 	 s 	 	and	 divorce 	 s 	 	,	 friend 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	 de 	 friend 	 ing 	 s 	 	.	a	lot	of	 complex 	 ity 	 	,	a	lot	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	just	in	 th 	 is 	 	30	-	year	period	that	 include 	 s 	 	the	 obes 	 ity 	 	 epi 	 demic 	 	.
and	,	by	the	end	,	you	're	going	to	see	 cluster 	 s 	 	of	 obes 	 e 	 	and	non	-	 obes 	 e 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	network	.
now	,	when	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	,	it	 change 	 d 	 	the	way	i	see	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	thing	,	 th 	 is 	 	network	that	's	changing	 a 	 cross 	 	time	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 memor 	 y 	 	,	it	 move 	 s 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	flow	 with 	 in 	 	it	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	 consist 	 ency 	 	--	people	can	die	,	but	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	die	;	it	still	 persist 	 s 	 	--
and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	 resili 	 ence 	 	that	 allow 	 s 	 	it	to	persist	 a 	 cross 	 	time	.
and	so	,	i	came	to	see	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	social	 network 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	living	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	living	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	could	put	under	a	kind	of	 micro 	 scope 	 	to	 stud 	 y 	 	and	 analyz 	 e 	 	and	understand	.
and	we	used	a	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	other	 phenomen 	 a 	 	.
we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 smok 	 ing 	 	and	 drink 	 ing 	 	behavior	,	and	 vot 	 ing 	 	behavior	,	and	divorce	--	which	can	spread	--	and	 al 	 truism 	 	.
and	,	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	we	 be 	 came 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 emotion 	 s 	 	.
now	,	when	we	have	 emotion 	 s 	 	,	we	show	them	.
why	do	we	show	our	 emotion 	 s 	 	?
i	mean	,	there	would	be	an	advantage	to	 ex 	 peri 	 encing 	 	our	 emotion 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	,	you	know	,	anger	or	happiness	.	but	we	do	n't	just	experience	them	,	we	show	them	.
and	not	 on 	 ly 	 	do	we	show	them	,	but	 other 	 s 	 	can	read	them	.
and	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	can	they	read	them	,	but	they	copy	them	.
there	's	 emotion 	 al 	 	 con 	 tag 	 ion 	 	that	 take 	 s 	 	place	in	human	 population 	 s 	 	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	function	of	 emotion 	 s 	 	 suggest 	 s 	 	that	,	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	any	other	purpose	they	serve	,	they	're	a	kind	of	primitive	form	of	communication	.
and	that	,	in	fact	,	if	we	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	understand	human	 emotion 	 s 	 	,	we	need	to	think	about	them	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
now	,	we	're	 ac 	 custom 	 ed 	 	to	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 emotion 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	,	in	simple	,	sort	of	,	brief	 period 	 s 	 	of	time	.
so	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	i	was	giving	 th 	 is 	 	talk	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	in	new	york	city	,	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	when	you	're	on	the	 sub 	 way 	 	and	the	other	person	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 sub 	 way 	 	car	 s 	 mile 	 s 	 	at	you	,	and	you	just	 instinct 	 ively 	 	 s 	 mile 	 	back	?	``	and	they	 look 	 ed 	 	at	me	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	do	n't	do	that	in	new	york	city	.	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 every 	 where 	 	else	in	the	world	,	that	's	normal	human	behavior	.	``
and	so	there	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 instinct 	 ive 	 	way	in	which	we	 brief 	 ly 	 	transmit	 emotion 	 s 	 	to	each	other	.
and	,	in	fact	,	 emotion 	 al 	 	 con 	 tag 	 ion 	 	can	be	 broad 	 er 	 	still	.	like	we	could	have	 punctu 	 ated 	 	 express 	 ions 	 	of	anger	,	 a 	 s 	 	in	 riot 	 s 	 	.
the	question	that	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	ask	was	:	could	emotion	spread	,	in	a	more	 sustain 	 ed 	 	way	than	 riot 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 cross 	 	time	and	involve	large	 number 	 s 	 	of	people	,	not	just	 th 	 is 	 	pair	of	 individual 	 s 	 	 smil 	 ing 	 	at	each	other	in	the	 sub 	 way 	 	car	?
 may 	 be 	 	there	's	a	kind	of	 be 	 low 	 	the	surface	,	quiet	riot	that	 animate 	 s 	 	us	all	the	time	.
 may 	 be 	 	there	are	 emotion 	 al 	 	 stampede 	 s 	 	that	ripple	through	social	 network 	 s 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	,	in	fact	,	 emotion 	 s 	 	have	a	 collect 	 ive 	 	 exist 	 ence 	 	,	not	just	an	individual	 exist 	 ence 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	first	 image 	 s 	 	we	made	to	 stud 	 y 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 phenomen 	 on 	 	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	a	social	network	,	but	now	we	color	the	people	yellow	if	they	're	happy	and	blue	if	they	're	 s 	 ad 	 	and	green	in	between	.
and	if	you	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	image	,	you	can	right	away	see	 cluster 	 s 	 	of	happy	and	 un 	 happy 	 	people	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 spread 	 ing 	 	to	three	 degree 	 s 	 	of	 separat 	 ion 	 	.
and	you	might	form	the	 intuit 	 ion 	 	that	the	 un 	 happy 	 	people	occupy	a	different	structural	location	 with 	 in 	 	the	network	.
there	's	a	middle	and	an	edge	to	 th 	 is 	 	network	,	and	the	 un 	 happy 	 	people	seem	to	be	 locate 	 d 	 	at	the	 edge 	 s 	 	.
so	to	invoke	 an 	 other 	 	metaphor	,	if	you	imagine	social	 network 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	vast	fabric	of	 human 	 ity 	 	--	i	'm	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	you	and	you	to	her	,	on	out	 end 	 lessly 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	distance	--	 th 	 is 	 	fabric	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	like	an	old	-	 fashion 	 ed 	 	american	quilt	,	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 patch 	 es 	 	on	it	:	happy	and	 un 	 happy 	 	 patch 	 es 	 	.
and	 whet 	 her 	 	you	 be 	 come 	 	happy	or	not	 depend 	 s 	 	in	part	on	 whet 	 her 	 	you	occupy	a	happy	patch	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	work	with	 emotion 	 s 	 	,	which	are	so	fundamental	,	then	got	us	to	 think 	 ing 	 	about	:	 may 	 be 	 	the	fundamental	 cause 	 s 	 	of	human	social	 network 	 s 	 	are	 some 	 how 	 	 encode 	 d 	 	in	our	 gene 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	human	social	 network 	 s 	 	,	 when 	 ever 	 	they	are	 ma 	 pped 	 	,	 al 	 ways 	 	kind	of	look	like	 th 	 is 	 	:	the	picture	of	the	network	.	but	they	never	look	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
why	do	they	not	look	like	 th 	 is 	 	?
why	do	n't	we	form	human	social	 network 	 s 	 	that	look	like	a	regular	lattice	?
well	,	the	 s 	 tri 	 king 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	of	human	social	 network 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 ubiqu 	 ity 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 ap 	 parent 	 	purpose	beg	 question 	 s 	 	about	 whet 	 her 	 	we	 evolv 	 ed 	 	to	have	human	social	 network 	 s 	 	in	the	first	place	,	and	 whet 	 her 	 	we	 evolv 	 ed 	 	to	form	 network 	 s 	 	with	a	 part 	 icular 	 	structure	.
and	notice	first	of	all	--	so	,	to	understand	 th 	 is 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	we	need	to	dissect	network	structure	a	little	bit	first	--
and	notice	that	every	person	in	 th 	 is 	 	network	 ha 	 s 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	structural	location	 a 	 s 	 	every	other	person	.
but	that	's	not	the	case	with	real	 network 	 s 	 	.
so	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	here	is	a	real	network	of	college	 student 	 s 	 	at	an	elite	 north 	 eastern 	 	university	.
and	now	i	'm	 high 	 light 	 ing 	 	a	few	 dot 	 s 	 	.
if	you	look	here	at	the	 dot 	 s 	 	,	 compar 	 e 	 	 no 	 de 	 	b	in	the	upper	left	to	 no 	 de 	 	d	in	the	far	right	;
b	 ha 	 s 	 	four	 friend 	 s 	 	coming	out	from	him
and	d	 ha 	 s 	 	six	 friend 	 s 	 	coming	out	from	him	.
and	so	,	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 individual 	 s 	 	have	different	 number 	 s 	 	of	 friend 	 s 	 	.	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	obvious	,	we	all	know	that	.	but	certain	other	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	of	social	network	structure	are	not	so	obvious	.
 compar 	 e 	 	 no 	 de 	 	b	in	the	upper	left	to	 no 	 de 	 	a	in	the	lower	left	.
now	,	 t 	 hose 	 	people	both	have	four	 friend 	 s 	 	,	but	a	's	 friend 	 s 	 	all	know	each	other	,	and	b	's	 friend 	 s 	 	do	not	.
so	the	friend	of	a	friend	of	a	's	is	,	back	 aga 	 in 	 	,	a	friend	of	a	's	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	the	friend	of	a	friend	of	b	's	is	not	a	friend	of	b	's	,	but	is	 far 	 ther 	 	away	in	the	network	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	known	 a 	 s 	 	 transit 	 ivity 	 	in	 network 	 s 	 	.
and	,	 final 	 ly 	 	,	 compar 	 e 	 	 nod 	 es 	 	c	and	d	:
c	and	d	both	have	six	 friend 	 s 	 	.
if	you	talk	to	them	,	and	you	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	is	your	social	life	like	?	``
they	would	say	,	``	i	've	got	six	 friend 	 s 	 	.
that	's	my	social	experience	.	``	but	now	we	,	with	a	bird	's	eye	view	looking	at	 th 	 is 	 	network	,	can	see	that	they	occupy	 ver 	 y 	 	different	social	 world 	 s 	 	.	and	i	can	 cultiv 	 ate 	 	that	 intuit 	 ion 	 	in	you	by	just	 ask 	 ing 	 	you	:	who	would	you	 ra 	 ther 	 	be	if	a	 dead 	 ly 	 	germ	was	 spread 	 ing 	 	through	the	network	?
would	you	 ra 	 ther 	 	be	c	or	d	?
you	'd	 ra 	 ther 	 	be	d	,	on	the	edge	of	the	network	.
and	now	who	would	you	 ra 	 ther 	 	be	if	a	 ju 	 ic 	 y 	 	piece	of	gossip	--	not	about	you	--	was	 spread 	 ing 	 	through	the	network	?
now	,	you	would	 ra 	 ther 	 	be	c	.
so	different	structural	 location 	 s 	 	have	different	 implic 	 ations 	 	for	your	life	.
and	,	in	fact	,	when	we	did	some	 experiment 	 s 	 	looking	at	 th 	 is 	 	,	what	we	found	is	that	46	percent	of	the	 vari 	 ation 	 	in	how	 man 	 y 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	you	have	is	 explain 	 ed 	 	by	your	 gene 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	surprising	.	we	know	that	some	people	are	born	 s 	 hy 	 	and	some	are	born	gregarious	.	that	's	obvious	.
but	we	 al 	 so 	 	found	some	non	-	obvious	 thing 	 s 	 	.
for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	47	percent	in	the	 vari 	 ation 	 	in	 whet 	 her 	 	your	 friend 	 s 	 	know	each	other	is	 attribut 	 able 	 	to	your	 gene 	 s 	 	.
 whet 	 her 	 	your	 friend 	 s 	 	know	each	other	 ha 	 s 	 	not	just	to	do	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 gene 	 s 	 	,	but	with	 your 	 s 	 	.
and	we	think	the	reason	for	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	some	people	like	to	 introduc 	 e 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	to	each	other	--	you	know	who	you	are	--	and	 other 	 s 	 	of	you	keep	them	 a 	 part 	 	and	do	n't	 introduc 	 e 	 	your	 friend 	 s 	 	to	each	other	.
and	so	some	people	knit	together	the	 network 	 s 	 	around	them	,	creating	a	kind	of	dense	web	of	ties	in	which	they	're	 comfort 	 ably 	 	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	we	even	found	that	30	percent	of	the	 vari 	 ation 	 	in	 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	people	are	in	the	middle	or	on	the	edge	of	the	network	can	 al 	 so 	 	be	 attribut 	 ed 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 gene 	 s 	 	.
so	 whet 	 her 	 	you	find	 your 	 self 	 	in	the	middle	or	on	the	edge	is	 al 	 so 	 	 partial 	 ly 	 	 heri 	 table 	 	.
now	,	what	is	the	point	of	 th 	 is 	 	?
how	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	help	us	understand	?
how	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	help	us	figure	out	some	of	the	 problem 	 s 	 	that	are	 affect 	 ing 	 	us	these	 day 	 s 	 	?
well	,	the	argument	i	'd	like	to	make	is	that	 network 	 s 	 	have	value	.
they	are	a	kind	of	social	capital	.
new	 proper 	 ties 	 	emerge	 be 	 cause 	 	of	our	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 ness 	 	in	social	 network 	 s 	 	,	and	these	 proper 	 ties 	 	 in 	 here 	 	in	the	structure	of	the	 network 	 s 	 	,	not	just	in	the	 individual 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	them	.
so	think	about	these	two	common	 object 	 s 	 	.
they	're	both	made	of	carbon	,	and	yet	one	of	them	 ha 	 s 	 	carbon	 atom 	 s 	 	in	it	that	are	 arrange 	 d 	 	in	one	 part 	 icular 	 	way	--	on	the	left	--	and	you	get	 graph 	 ite 	 	,	which	is	soft	and	dark	.
but	if	you	take	the	same	carbon	 atom 	 s 	 	and	interconnect	them	a	different	way	,	you	get	diamond	,	which	is	clear	and	hard	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	 proper 	 ties 	 	of	 soft 	 ness 	 	and	 hard 	 ness 	 	and	 dark 	 ness 	 	and	 clear 	 ness 	 	do	not	 re 	 side 	 	in	the	carbon	 atom 	 s 	 	;
they	 re 	 side 	 	in	the	 interconnect 	 ions 	 	between	the	carbon	 atom 	 s 	 	,	or	at	 l 	 east 	 	arise	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 interconnect 	 ions 	 	between	the	carbon	 atom 	 s 	 	.
so	,	 similar 	 ly 	 	,	the	pattern	of	 connect 	 ions 	 	among	people	 confer 	 s 	 	 up 	 on 	 	the	 group 	 s 	 	of	people	different	 proper 	 ties 	 	.
it	is	the	ties	between	people	that	 make 	 s 	 	the	whole	 great 	 er 	 	than	the	sum	of	 it 	 s 	 	 part 	 s 	 	.
and	so	it	is	not	just	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	to	these	people	--	 whet 	 her 	 	they	're	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	weight	or	 gain 	 ing 	 	weight	,	or	 be 	 coming 	 	rich	or	 be 	 coming 	 	poor	,	or	 be 	 coming 	 	happy	or	not	 be 	 coming 	 	happy	--	that	 affect 	 s 	 	us	;
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	the	actual	 architect 	 ure 	 	of	the	ties	around	us	.
our	experience	of	the	world	 depend 	 s 	 	on	the	actual	structure	of	the	 network 	 s 	 	in	which	we	're	 re 	 sid 	 ing 	 	and	on	all	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	ripple	and	flow	through	the	network	.
now	,	the	reason	,	i	think	,	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	case	is	that	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	assemble	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	form	a	kind	of	 super 	 organism 	 	.
now	,	a	 super 	 organism 	 	is	a	 collect 	 ion 	 	of	 individual 	 s 	 	which	show	or	 e 	 vince 	 	 behavior 	 s 	 	or	 phenomen 	 a 	 	that	are	not	 reduc 	 ible 	 	to	the	 stud 	 y 	 	of	 individual 	 s 	 	and	that	must	be	 under 	 stood 	 	by	 re 	 ference 	 	to	,	and	by	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	,	the	 collect 	 ive 	 	.	like	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	a	hive	of	bees	that	's	 find 	 ing 	 	a	new	 nest 	 ing 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	or	a	flock	of	 bird 	 s 	 	that	's	 evad 	 ing 	 	a	predator	,	or	a	flock	of	 bird 	 s 	 	that	's	able	to	pool	 it 	 s 	 	 wis 	 dom 	 	and	 navig 	 ate 	 	and	find	a	 tin 	 y 	 	 s 	 peck 	 	of	an	 is 	 land 	 	in	the	middle	of	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	,	or	a	pack	of	 wo 	 lv 	 es 	 	that	's	able	to	 br 	 ing 	 	down	 large 	 r 	 	 pre 	 y 	 	.
 super 	 organism 	 s 	 	have	 proper 	 ties 	 	that	can	not	be	 under 	 stood 	 	just	by	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	the	 individual 	 s 	 	.
i	think	 understand 	 ing 	 	social	 network 	 s 	 	and	how	they	form	and	 oper 	 ate 	 	can	help	us	understand	not	just	health	and	 emotion 	 s 	 	but	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	other	 phenomen 	 a 	 	--	like	crime	,	and	 war 	 fare 	 	,	and	economic	 phenomen 	 a 	 	like	bank	 run 	 s 	 	and	market	 crash 	 es 	 	and	the	 adopt 	 ion 	 	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	and	the	spread	of	product	 adopt 	 ion 	 	.
now	,	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	think	we	form	social	 network 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 benefit 	 s 	 	of	a	 connect 	 ed 	 	life	outweigh	the	 cost 	 s 	 	.
if	i	was	 al 	 ways 	 	violent	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	you	or	 g 	 ave 	 	you	 mis 	 information 	 	or	made	you	 s 	 ad 	 	or	 infect 	 ed 	 	you	with	 dead 	 ly 	 	 germ 	 s 	 	,	you	would	cut	the	ties	to	me	,	and	the	network	would	 dis 	 integrate 	 	.
so	the	spread	of	good	and	 valu 	 able 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	is	 requir 	 ed 	 	to	sustain	and	nourish	social	 network 	 s 	 	.
 similar 	 ly 	 	,	social	 network 	 s 	 	are	 requir 	 ed 	 	for	the	spread	of	good	and	 valu 	 able 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	like	love	and	 kind 	 ness 	 	and	happiness	and	 al 	 truism 	 	and	 idea 	 s 	 	.
i	think	,	in	fact	,	that	if	we	 real 	 ized 	 	how	 valu 	 able 	 	social	 network 	 s 	 	are	,	we	'd	 s 	 pend 	 	a	lot	more	time	 nourish 	 ing 	 	them	and	 sustain 	 ing 	 	them	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	social	 network 	 s 	 	are	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	related	to	 good 	 ness 	 	.	and	what	i	think	the	world	 need 	 s 	 	now	is	more	 connect 	 ions 	 	.
thank	you	.
