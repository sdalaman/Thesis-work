 a 	 s 	 	a	 research 	 er 	 	,	every	once	in	a	while	you	 en 	 counter 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	a	little	disconcerting	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 change 	 s 	 	your	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	the	world	around	you	,	and	 teach 	 es 	 	you	that	you	're	 ver 	 y 	 	wrong	about	 some 	 thing 	 	that	you	 re 	 ally 	 	 believ 	 ed 	 	 firm 	 ly 	 	in	.
and	these	are	 un 	 fortunate 	 	 moment 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	go	to	sleep	that	night	 dumb 	 er 	 	than	when	you	 wok 	 e 	 	up	.
so	,	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	the	goal	of	my	talk	,	is	to	a	,	communicate	that	moment	to	you	and	b	,	have	you	 leav 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	session	a	little	 dumb 	 er 	 	than	when	you	 enter 	 ed 	 	.
so	,	i	hope	i	can	 re 	 ally 	 	accomplish	that	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	incident	that	i	'm	going	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	with	some	 dia 	 rrhea 	 	.
now	,	we	've	known	for	a	long	time	the	cause	of	 dia 	 rrhea 	 	.
that	's	why	there	's	a	glass	of	water	up	there	.
for	us	,	it	's	a	problem	,	the	people	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	.	for	 bab 	 ies 	 	,	it	's	 dead 	 ly 	 	.
they	lack	 nutrient 	 s 	 	,	and	 dia 	 rrhea 	 	dehydrates	them	.
and	so	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	,	there	is	a	lot	of	death	,	a	lot	of	death	.
in	india	in	1960	,	there	was	a	24	percent	child	 mortal 	 ity 	 	rate	,	 lot 	 s 	 	of	people	did	n't	make	it	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 un 	 fortunate 	 	.
one	of	the	big	 reason 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	was	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 dia 	 rrhea 	 	.
now	,	there	was	a	big	effort	to	solve	 th 	 is 	 	problem	,
and	there	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	big	solution	.
 th 	 is 	 	solution	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	,	by	some	,	``	 potential 	 ly 	 	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	medical	advance	 th 	 is 	 	century	.	``
now	,	the	solution	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	simple	.
and	what	it	was	was	 or 	 al 	 	 re 	 hyd 	 ration 	 	 salt 	 s 	 	.
 man 	 y 	 	of	you	have	 prob 	 ably 	 	used	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	's	 brilli 	 ant 	 	.	it	's	a	way	to	get	 so 	 d 	 ium 	 	and	glucose	together	so	that	when	you	add	it	to	water	the	child	is	able	to	absorb	it	even	 dur 	 ing 	 	 situ 	 ations 	 	of	 dia 	 rrhea 	 	.

massive	solution	to	the	problem	.
flash	forward	:	1960	,	24	percent	child	 mortal 	 ity 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 drop 	 ped 	 	to	6.5	percent	 to 	 day 	 	.
still	a	big	number	,	but	a	big	drop	.
it	 look 	 s 	 	like	the	 techno 	 logical 	 	problem	is	 solve 	 d 	 	.
but	if	you	look	,	even	 to 	 day 	 	there	are	about	400,000	 dia 	 rrhea 	 	-	related	 death 	 s 	 	in	india	 al 	 one 	 	.
what	's	going	on	here	?
well	the	easy	answer	is	,	we	just	have	n't	gotten	 t 	 hose 	 	 salt 	 s 	 	to	 t 	 hose 	 	people	.
that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	not	true	.
if	you	look	in	 area 	 s 	 	where	these	 salt 	 s 	 	are	 complete 	 ly 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	,	the	price	is	low	or	zero	,	these	 death 	 s 	 	still	 continu 	 e 	 	 ab 	 ated 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	there	's	a	 bio 	 logical 	 	answer	.
 may 	 be 	 	these	are	the	 death 	 s 	 	that	simple	 re 	 hyd 	 ration 	 	 al 	 one 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	solve	.	that	's	not	true	either	.
 man 	 y 	 	of	these	 death 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	 prevent 	 able 	 	,
and	 th 	 is 	 	what	i	want	to	think	of	 a 	 s 	 	the	disconcerting	thing	,	what	i	want	to	call	``	the	last	mile	``	problem	.
see	,	we	 s 	 pent 	 	a	lot	of	energy	,	in	 man 	 y 	 	 domain 	 s 	 	--

that	's	 be 	 en 	 	the	 discover 	 ies 	 	of	the	last	2,000	 year 	 s 	 	,
that	's	 man 	 kind 	 	moving	forward	.
but	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	we	 crack 	 ed 	 	it	,	but	a	big	part	of	the	problem	still	 remain 	 s 	 	.
nine	hundred	and	ninety	-	nine	 mile 	 s 	 	went	well	,

 may 	 be 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 un 	 ique 	 	about	 dia 	 rrhea 	 	.
well	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	 thing 	 s 	 	get	 re 	 ally 	 	disconcerting	--	it	's	not	 un 	 ique 	 	to	 dia 	 rrhea 	 	.
it	's	not	even	 un 	 ique 	 	to	poor	people	in	india	.
here	's	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	from	a	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 con 	 text 	 s 	 	.
i	've	put	a	bunch	of	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	up	here	.
i	'll	start	with	insulin	,	diabetes	 medic 	 ation 	 	in	the	u.s	.

here	i	have	a	bunch	of	other	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	,	all	suffer	from	the	last	mile	problem	.
it	's	not	just	medicine	.
here	's	 an 	 other 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	from	technology	:
 agricultur 	 e 	 	.	we	think	there	's	a	food	problem	,	so	we	create	new	 seed 	 s 	 	.
we	think	there	's	an	income	problem	,	so	we	create	new	ways	of	 farm 	 ing 	 	that	 in 	 crease 	 	income	.
well	,	look	at	some	old	ways	,	some	ways	that	we	'd	 al 	 ready 	 	 crack 	 ed 	 	.

some	people	are	 do 	 ing 	 	that	,	 man 	 y 	 	are	not	.	what	's	going	on	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	last	mile	.
the	last	mile	is	,	 every 	 where 	 	,	 problem 	 atic 	 	.
 al 	 right 	 	,	what	's	the	problem	?
the	problem	is	 th 	 is 	 	little	three	-	pound	machine	that	's	 be 	 hind 	 	your	 eye 	 s 	 	and	between	your	 ear 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	machine	is	 re 	 ally 	 	strange	,	and	one	of	the	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	is	that	people	are	weird	.
they	do	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 in 	 consist 	 ent 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
they	do	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 in 	 consist 	 ent 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	the	 in 	 consist 	 encies 	 	create	,	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	last	mile	problem	.
see	,	when	we	 we 	 re 	 	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	our	biology	,	bacteria	,	the	 gene 	 s 	 	,	the	 thing 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	here	,	the	blood	?	that	's	complex	,	but	it	's	 manage 	 able 	 	.
when	we	're	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	people	like	 th 	 is 	 	?	the	mind	is	more	complex	.
that	's	not	 a 	 s 	 	 manage 	 able 	 	,	and	that	's	what	we	're	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	with	.
let	me	go	back	to	 dia 	 rrhea 	 	for	a	second	.
here	's	a	question	that	was	 ask 	 ed 	 	in	the	national	 s 	 ample 	 	survey	,	which	is	a	survey	 ask 	 ed 	 	of	 man 	 y 	 	indian	women	:
``	your	child	 ha 	 s 	 	 dia 	 rrhea 	 	.
should	you	 in 	 crease 	 	,	maintain	or	 de 	 crease 	 	the	number	of	 fluid 	 s 	 	?	``
just	so	you	do	n't	embarrass	 your 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	i	'll	give	you	the	right	answer	:
it	's	 in 	 crease 	 	.
now	,	 dia 	 rrhea 	 	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	around	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	ever	since	 human 	 kind 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	lived	side	by	side	 en 	 ough 	 	to	have	 re 	 ally 	 	 pollute 	 d 	 	water	.
one	roman	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	that	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	was	that	--	and	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	them	a	 compar 	 ative 	 	advantage	--	they	made	 s 	 ure 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 soldier 	 s 	 	did	n't	drink	even	 remote 	 ly 	 	 mud 	 di 	 ed 	 	 water 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	if	some	of	your	 troop 	 s 	 	get	 dia 	 rrhea 	 	they	're	not	that	effective	on	the	 battle 	 field 	 	.
so	,	if	you	think	of	roman	 compar 	 ative 	 	advantage	part	of	it	was	the	breast	 shield 	 s 	 	,	the	breastplates	,	but	part	of	it	was	 drink 	 ing 	 	the	right	water	.
so	,	here	are	these	women	.	they	've	 s 	 een 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	have	 struggle 	 d 	 	with	 dia 	 rrhea 	 	,	they	've	 struggle 	 d 	 	with	 dia 	 rrhea 	 	,
they	've	 s 	 een 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 death 	 s 	 	.	how	do	they	answer	 th 	 is 	 	question	?
in	india	,	35	to	50	percent	say	``	 reduc 	 e 	 	.	``
think	about	what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	for	a	second	.
thirty	-	five	to	50	percent	of	women	forget	 or 	 al 	 	 re 	 hyd 	 ration 	 	therapy	,	they	are	increasing	--	they	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	making	 the 	 ir 	 	child	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	die	through	 the 	 ir 	 	 action 	 s 	 	.
how	is	that	possible	?
well	,	one	 possibil 	 ity 	 	--	i	think	that	's	how	most	people	respond	to	 th 	 is 	 	--	is	to	say	,	``	that	's	just	stupid	.	``
i	do	n't	think	that	's	stupid	.
i	think	there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 pro 	 found 	 ly 	 	right	in	what	these	women	are	 do 	 ing 	 	.
and	that	is	,	you	do	n't	put	water	 in 	 to 	 	a	 leak 	 y 	 	 buck 	 et 	 	.
so	,	think	of	the	mental	model	that	 go 	 es 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	 reduc 	 ing 	 	the	 in 	 take 	 	.
just	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	sense	.
now	,	the	model	is	 intuitive 	 ly 	 	right	.
it	just	 do 	 es 	 	n't	happen	to	be	right	about	the	world	.
but	it	 make 	 s 	 	a	whole	lot	of	sense	at	some	deep	level	.
and	that	,	to	me	,	is	the	fundamental	 challeng 	 e 	 	of	the	last	mile	.
 th 	 is 	 	first	 challeng 	 e 	 	is	what	i	refer	to	 a 	 s 	 	the	 persuas 	 ion 	 	 challeng 	 e 	 	.
convincing	people	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	--	take	 or 	 al 	 	 re 	 hyd 	 ration 	 	therapy	,	intercrop	,	 what 	 ever 	 	it	might	be	--	is	not	an	act	of	information	:
``	let	's	give	them	the	data	,	and	when	they	have	data	they	'll	do	the	right	thing	.	``
it	's	more	complex	than	that	.
and	if	you	want	to	understand	how	it	's	more	complex	let	me	start	with	 some 	 thing 	 	kind	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	give	you	a	little	math	problem	,
and	i	want	you	to	just	yell	out	the	answer	 a 	 s 	 	fast	 a 	 s 	 	possible	.
a	bat	and	a	ball	together	cost	$	1.10	.
the	bat	 cost 	 s 	 	a	dollar	more	than	the	ball	.
how	much	 do 	 es 	 	the	ball	cost	?	quick	.
so	,	 some 	 body 	 	out	there	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	five	.	``
a	lot	of	you	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	ten	.	``
let	's	think	about	10	for	a	second	.
if	the	ball	 cost 	 s 	 	10	,	the	bat	 cost 	 s 	 	...
 th 	 is 	 	is	easy	,	$	1.10	.
 yea 	 h 	 	.	so	,	together	they	would	cost	$	1.20	.
so	,	here	you	all	are	,	 o 	 sten 	 s 	 ibly 	 	educated	people	.
most	of	you	look	smart	.
the	combination	of	that	 produce 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	you	got	 th 	 is 	 	thing	wrong	.
how	is	that	possible	?	let	's	go	to	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
i	know	algebra	can	be	 complic 	 ated 	 	.
so	,	let	's	dial	 th 	 is 	 	back	.	that	's	what	?	fifth	grade	?	fourth	grade	?
let	's	go	back	to	 kind 	 ergarten 	 	.	ok	?
there	's	a	great	show	on	american	 tele 	 vision 	 	that	you	have	to	watch	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	are	you	 smart 	 er 	 	than	a	fifth	 grad 	 er 	 	?	``
i	think	we	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	the	answer	to	that	here	.
let	's	move	to	 kind 	 ergarten 	 	.	let	's	see	if	we	can	beat	five	-	year	-	olds	.
here	's	what	i	'm	going	to	do	:	i	'm	going	to	put	 object 	 s 	 	on	the	screen	.
i	just	want	you	to	name	the	color	of	the	object	.
that	's	all	it	is	.	ok	?
i	want	you	to	do	it	fast	,	and	say	it	out	loud	with	me	,
and	do	it	 quick 	 ly 	 	.	i	'll	make	the	first	one	easy	for	you	.
ready	?	black	.
now	the	next	 one 	 s 	 	i	want	you	to	do	 quick 	 ly 	 	and	say	it	out	loud	.
ready	?	go	.

sendhil	mullainathan	:	that	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	.
 al 	 most 	 	out	of	 kind 	 ergarten 	 	.
what	is	all	 th 	 is 	 	 tell 	 ing 	 	us	?
you	see	,	what	's	going	on	here	,	and	in	the	bat	and	ball	problem	is	that	you	have	some	intuitive	ways	of	 interact 	 ing 	 	with	the	world	,	some	 model 	 s 	 	that	you	use	to	understand	the	world	.
these	 model 	 s 	 	,	like	the	 leak 	 y 	 	 buck 	 et 	 	,	work	well	in	most	 situ 	 ations 	 	.
i	suspect	most	of	you	--	i	hope	that	's	true	for	the	rest	of	you	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	 pre 	 tty 	 	well	with	 add 	 ition 	 	and	 subtract 	 ion 	 	in	the	real	world	.
i	found	a	problem	,	a	specific	problem	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	found	an	error	with	that	.
 dia 	 rrhea 	 	,	and	 man 	 y 	 	last	mile	 problem 	 s 	 	,	are	like	that	.
they	are	 situ 	 ations 	 	where	the	mental	model	 do 	 es 	 	n't	match	the	 re 	 ality 	 	.
same	thing	here	:	you	had	an	intuitive	 respons 	 e 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	that	was	 ver 	 y 	 	quick	.
you	read	``	blue	``	and	you	 want 	 ed 	 	to	say	``	blue	,	``	even	 th 	 ough 	 	you	 k 	 new 	 	your	task	was	red	.
now	,	i	do	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 f 	 un 	 	.
but	it	's	more	 pro 	 found 	 	than	 f 	 un 	 	.
i	'll	give	you	a	good	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	how	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 effect 	 s 	 	 persuas 	 ion 	 	.
bmw	is	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	safe	car	.
and	they	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	,	``	 safe 	 ty 	 	is	good	.
i	want	to	advertise	 safe 	 ty 	 	.	how	am	i	going	to	advertise	 safe 	 ty 	 	?	``
``	i	could	give	people	 number 	 s 	 	.	we	do	well	on	crash	 test 	 s 	 	.	``
but	the	truth	of	the	matter	is	,	you	look	at	that	car	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	look	like	a	volvo	,
and	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	look	like	a	hummer	.
so	,	what	i	want	you	to	think	about	for	a	few	 minute 	 s 	 	is	:	how	would	you	convey	 safe 	 ty 	 	of	the	bmw	?	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
so	now	,	while	you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	about	that	let	's	move	to	a	second	task	.
the	second	task	is	fuel	efficiency	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
here	's	 an 	 other 	 	 puzzl 	 e 	 	for	all	of	you	.
one	person	 walk 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	car	lot	,	and	they	're	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 buy 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	toyota	yaris	.
they	are	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	35	 mile 	 s 	 	per	gallon	.	i	'm	going	to	do	the	 environment 	 ally 	 	right	thing	,	i	'm	going	to	buy	the	prius	,	 an 	 other 	 	person	 walk 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	lot	,
and	they	're	about	to	buy	a	hummer	,	nine	 mile 	 s 	 	per	gallon	,	fully	 load 	 ed 	 	,	 luxur 	 y 	 	.
and	they	say	,	``	you	know	what	?	do	i	need	turbo	?	do	i	need	 th 	 is 	 	heavyweight	car	?	``
i	'm	going	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	good	for	the	environment	.
i	'm	going	to	take	off	some	of	that	weight	,	and	i	'm	going	to	buy	a	hummer	that	's	11	 mile 	 s 	 	per	gallon	.	``	which	one	of	these	people	 ha 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	more	for	the	environment	?
see	,	you	have	a	mental	model	.
fifty	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	35	,	that	's	a	big	move	.	eleven	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	nine	?	come	on	.
 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	go	home	and	do	the	math	,	the	nine	to	11	is	a	 big 	 ger 	 	change	.	that	person	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	more	 gallon 	 s 	 	.
why	?	 be 	 cause 	 	we	do	n't	care	about	 mile 	 s 	 	per	gallon	,	we	care	about	 gallon 	 s 	 	per	mile	.
think	about	how	 power 	 ful 	 	that	is	if	you	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 encourag 	 e 	 	fuel	efficiency	.
 mile 	 s 	 	per	gallon	is	the	way	we	present	 thing 	 s 	 	.
if	we	want	to	 encourag 	 e 	 	change	of	behavior	,	 gallon 	 s 	 	per	mile	would	have	far	more	 effective 	 ness 	 	.
 research 	 ers 	 	have	found	these	type	of	 anomal 	 ies 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	back	to	bmw	.	what	should	they	do	?
the	problem	bmw	 face 	 s 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	car	 look 	 s 	 	safe	.
 th 	 is 	 	car	,	which	is	my	mini	,	 do 	 es 	 	n't	look	that	safe	.
here	was	bmw	's	 brilli 	 ant 	 	 in 	 sight 	 	,	which	they	 embodi 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	an	ad	campaign	.
they	 show 	 ed 	 	a	bmw	 driv 	 ing 	 	down	the	street	.
there	's	a	truck	on	the	right	.	boxes	fall	out	of	the	truck	.
the	car	swerves	to	avoid	it	,	and	 there 	 fore 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	get	 in 	 to 	 	an	accident	.
bwm	 real 	 ize 	 s 	 	 safe 	 ty 	 	,	in	people	's	 mind 	 s 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	two	 component 	 s 	 	.
you	can	be	safe	 be 	 cause 	 	when	you	're	hit	,	you	 surviv 	 e 	 	,	or	you	can	be	safe	 be 	 cause 	 	you	avoid	 accident 	 s 	 	.
 remark 	 ably 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	campaign	,	but	notice	the	power	of	it	.
it	 harness 	 es 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	you	 al 	 ready 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	.
now	,	even	if	i	 persuad 	 ed 	 	you	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	,	it	's	hard	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	action	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	.
you	all	 prob 	 ably 	 	 intend 	 ed 	 	to	wake	up	,	i	do	n't	know	,	6:30	,	7	a.m	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	battle	we	all	fight	every	day	,	 a 	 long 	 	with	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	to	the	gym	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	that	battle	,	and	 make 	 s 	 	us	 real 	 ize 	 	 intent 	 ions 	 	do	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	 transl 	 ate 	 	 in 	 to 	 	action	,	and	so	one	of	the	fundamental	 challeng 	 es 	 	is	how	we	would	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	that	.	ok	?
so	,	let	me	now	talk	about	the	last	mile	problem	.
so	far	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	negative	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	show	you	the	 odd 	 ities 	 	of	human	behavior	.
and	i	think	 may 	 be 	 	i	'm	 be 	 ing 	 	too	negative	.
 may 	 be 	 	it	's	the	 dia 	 rrhea 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	the	last	mile	problem	 re 	 ally 	 	should	be	thought	of	 a 	 s 	 	the	last	mile	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
let	's	go	back	to	diabetes	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	typical	insulin	 inject 	 ion 	 	.
now	,	 carry 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	thing	around	is	 complic 	 ated 	 	.
you	got	ta	carry	the	bottle	,	you	got	ta	carry	the	syringe	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 pain 	 ful 	 	.
now	,	you	may	think	to	 your 	 self 	 	,	``	well	,	if	my	 eye 	 s 	 	 depend 	 ed 	 	on	it	,	you	know	,	i	would	 obvious 	 ly 	 	use	it	every	day	.	``	but	the	pain	,	the	 dis 	 comfort 	 	,	you	know	,	 pay 	 ing 	 	attention	,	 remember 	 ing 	 	to	put	it	in	your	 pur 	 s 	 e 	 	when	you	go	on	a	long	trip	:	these	are	the	day	-	to	-	day	of	life	,	and	they	do	pose	 problem 	 s 	 	.
here	is	an	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	a	design	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	pen	,	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	an	insulin	pen	,	 pre 	 load 	 ed 	 	.
the	needle	is	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	sharp	.
you	just	got	ta	carry	 th 	 is 	 	thing	around	.
it	's	much	 eas 	 ier 	 	to	use	,	much	less	 pain 	 ful 	 	.
 any 	 where 	 	between	five	and	10	percent	 in 	 crease 	 	in	 adhere 	 nce 	 	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
that	's	what	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 a 	 s 	 	a	last	mile	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
you	see	,	we	tend	to	think	the	problem	is	 solve 	 d 	 	when	we	solve	the	technology	problem	.
but	the	human	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	the	human	problem	still	 remain 	 s 	 	,	and	that	's	a	great	 front 	 ier 	 	that	we	have	left	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	about	the	biology	of	people	;	 th 	 is 	 	is	now	about	the	 brain 	 s 	 	,	the	 psycho 	 logy 	 	of	people	,
and	 innov 	 ation 	 	 need 	 s 	 	to	 continu 	 e 	 	all	the	way	through	the	last	mile	.
here	's	 an 	 other 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	from	a	company	 call 	 ed 	 	positive	energy	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	about	energy	efficiency	.
we	're	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	time	on	fuel	 cell 	 s 	 	right	now	.
what	 th 	 is 	 	company	 do 	 es 	 	is	they	 s 	 end 	 	a	letter	to	 house 	 hold 	 s 	 	that	say	,	``	here	's	your	energy	use	,	here	's	your	neighbor	's	energy	use	:	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	well	.	``	smiley	face	.
``	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	 wo 	 rse 	 	.	``	frown	.
and	what	they	find	is	just	 th 	 is 	 	letter	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	else	,	 ha 	 s 	 	a	two	to	three	percent	 r 	 eduction 	 	in	 electric 	 ity 	 	use	.
and	you	want	to	think	about	the	social	value	of	that	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	carbon	 off 	 set 	 s 	 	,	 reduc 	 ed 	 	 electric 	 ity 	 	,	900	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	per	year	.
why	?	 be 	 cause 	 	for	free	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	a	new	technology	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	letter	--	we	're	 get 	 ting 	 	a	big	bang	in	behavior	.
so	,	how	do	we	tackle	the	last	mile	?
i	think	 th 	 is 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	us	there	is	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
and	i	think	to	tackle	it	,	we	need	to	combine	 psycho 	 logy 	 	,	 market 	 ing 	 	,	art	,	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	that	.
but	you	know	what	we	need	to	combine	it	with	?
we	need	to	combine	 th 	 is 	 	with	the	scientific	method	.
see	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 puzzl 	 ing 	 	and	 frust 	 rating 	 	about	the	last	mile	,	to	me	,	is	that	the	first	999	 mile 	 s 	 	are	all	about	science	.
no	one	would	say	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	medicine	 work 	 s 	 	,	go	 a 	 head 	 	and	use	it	.	``
we	have	 test 	 ing 	 	,	we	go	to	the	lab	,	we	try	it	 aga 	 in 	 	,	we	have	 refine 	 ment 	 	.
but	you	know	what	we	do	on	the	last	mile	?
``	oh	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	good	idea	.	people	will	like	 th 	 is 	 	.	let	's	put	it	out	there	.	``
the	amount	of	 resource 	 s 	 	we	put	in	are	disparate	.
we	put	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	fuel	-	efficient	 techno 	 logies 	 	.
how	much	are	we	 put 	 ting 	 	 in 	 to 	 	energy	behavior	change	in	a	credible	,	 system 	 atic 	 	,	 test 	 ing 	 	way	?
now	,	i	think	that	we	're	on	the	 ver 	 ge 	 	of	 some 	 thing 	 	big	.
we	're	on	the	 ver 	 ge 	 	of	a	whole	new	social	science	.
it	's	a	social	science	that	 recogn 	 ize 	 s 	 	--	much	like	science	 recogn 	 ize 	 s 	 	the	 complex 	 ity 	 	of	the	body	,	biology	 recogn 	 ize 	 s 	 	the	 complex 	 ity 	 	of	the	body	--	we	'll	 recogn 	 ize 	 	the	 complex 	 ity 	 	of	the	human	mind	.
the	 care 	 ful 	 	 test 	 ing 	 	,	retesting	,	design	,
are	going	to	open	up	 vista 	 s 	 	of	 understand 	 ing 	 	,	 complex 	 ities 	 	,	difficult	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	 vista 	 s 	 	will	both	create	new	science	,	and	fundamental	change	in	the	world	 a 	 s 	 	we	see	it	,	in	the	next	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	.
all	right	.	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
chris	anderson	:	sendhil	,	thank	you	so	much	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	whole	area	is	so	 fasci 	 nating 	 	.
i	mean	,	it	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 feel 	 s 	 	,	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	 behavior 	 al 	 	 economist 	 s 	 	that	they	are	kind	of	 put 	 ting 	 	 in 	 to 	 	place	 academic 	 ally 	 	,	what	great	 market 	 ers 	 	have	sort	of	 intuitive 	 ly 	 	known	for	a	long	time	.
how	much	is	your	field	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	great	 market 	 ers 	 	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 in 	 sight 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	human	 psycho 	 logy 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	they	've	 s 	 een 	 	it	on	the	ground	.
sendhil	mullainathan	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	we	 s 	 pend 	 	a	lot	of	time	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	 market 	 ers 	 	,
and	i	think	60	percent	of	it	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	you	say	,	there	are	 in 	 sight 	 s 	 	to	be	 gle 	 an 	 ed 	 	there	.	forty	percent	of	it	is	about	what	 market 	 ing 	 	is	.
 market 	 ing 	 	is	selling	an	ad	to	a	firm	.
so	,	in	some	sense	,	a	lot	of	 market 	 ing 	 	is	about	convincing	a	ceo	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	good	ad	campaign	.	``
so	,	there	is	a	little	bit	of	 slip 	 page 	 	there	.
that	's	just	a	 cave 	 at 	 	.	that	's	different	from	 actual 	 ly 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	an	effective	ad	campaign	.
and	one	of	the	new	 move 	 ments 	 	in	 market 	 ing 	 	is	:	how	do	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	measure	 effective 	 ness 	 	?	are	we	effective	?
ca	:	how	you	take	your	 in 	 sight 	 s 	 	here	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	them	 integrate 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	business	 model 	 s 	 	on	the	ground	,	in	indian	 village 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	?
sm	:	so	,	the	scientific	method	i	 allud 	 ed 	 	to	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
we	work	 close 	 ly 	 	with	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	that	have	 operation 	 al 	 	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	,	or	 non 	 profit 	 s 	 	that	have	 operation 	 al 	 	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	.
and	then	we	say	,	``	well	,	you	want	to	get	 th 	 is 	 	behavior	change	.
let	's	come	up	with	a	few	 idea 	 s 	 	,	test	them	,	see	which	is	 work 	 ing 	 	,	go	back	,	synthesize	,	and	try	to	come	up	with	a	thing	that	 work 	 s 	 	,	``	and	then	we	're	able	to	scale	with	 partner 	 s 	 	.
it	's	kind	of	the	model	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	in	other	 con 	 text 	 s 	 	.
if	you	have	 bio 	 logical 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	we	try	and	fix	it	,	see	if	it	 work 	 s 	 	,	and	then	work	the	scale	.
ca	:	 al 	 right 	 	sendhil	,	 thank 	 s 	 	so	much	for	coming	to	ted	.	thank	you	.
