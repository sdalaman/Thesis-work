for	 emotion 	 s 	 	,	we	should	not	move	 quick 	 ly 	 	to	the	desert	.
so	,	first	,	a	small	housekeeping	 announce 	 ment 	 	:	 pleas 	 e 	 	 s 	 witch 	 	off	your	proper	english	check	 program 	 s 	 	 install 	 ed 	 	in	your	brain	.
so	,	welcome	to	the	 gold 	 en 	 	desert	,	indian	desert	.
it	 receiv 	 es 	 	the	 l 	 east 	 	 rain 	 fall 	 	in	the	country	,
 low 	 est 	 	 rain 	 fall 	 	.
if	you	are	well	-	versed	with	 inch 	 es 	 	,	nine	 inch 	 es 	 	,
 centimeter 	 s 	 	,	16	[	 centimeter 	 s 	 	]	.
the	 ground 	 water 	 	is	300	feet	deep	,	100	 meter 	 s 	 	.
and	in	most	 part 	 s 	 	it	is	 s 	 al 	 ine 	 	,	not	fit	for	 drink 	 ing 	 	.
so	,	you	ca	n't	install	hand	 pump 	 s 	 	or	dig	 well 	 s 	 	,
 th 	 ough 	 	there	is	no	 electric 	 ity 	 	in	most	of	the	 village 	 s 	 	.
but	suppose	you	use	the	green	technology	,	solar	 pump 	 s 	 	--	they	are	of	no	use	in	 th 	 is 	 	area	.
so	,	welcome	to	the	 gold 	 en 	 	desert	.
 cloud 	 s 	 	seldom	visit	 th 	 is 	 	area	.	but	we	find	40	different	 name 	 s 	 	of	 cloud 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	dialect	used	here	.
there	are	a	number	of	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	to	harvest	rain	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	new	work	,	it	's	a	new	program	.
but	for	the	desert	 socie 	 ty 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	no	program	;	 th 	 is 	 	is	 the 	 ir 	 	life	.
and	they	harvest	rain	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	 de 	 vice 	 	they	use	in	 harvest 	 ing 	 	rain	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	kunds	;	 some 	 where 	 	it	is	 call 	 ed 	 	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	.
and	you	can	notice	they	have	 create 	 d 	 	a	kind	of	false	 catch 	 ment 	 	.
the	desert	is	there	,	sand	 dune 	 s 	 	,	some	small	field	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	big	raised	platform	.
you	can	notice	the	small	 hole 	 s 	 	the	water	will	fall	on	 th 	 is 	 	 catch 	 ment 	 	,	and	there	is	a	 slop 	 e 	 	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	our	 engineer 	 s 	 	and	 architect 	 s 	 	do	not	care	about	 slop 	 es 	 	in	 bath 	 rooms 	 	,	but	here	they	will	care	 proper 	 ly 	 	.
and	the	water	will	go	where	it	should	go	.
and	then	it	is	40	feet	deep	.
the	 water 	 proof 	 ing 	 	is	 d 	 one 	 	 perfect 	 ly 	 	,	better	than	our	city	 contract 	 ors 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	not	a	single	drop	should	go	waste	in	 th 	 is 	 	.
they	collect	100	thousand	 liter 	 s 	 	in	one	season	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 pur 	 e 	 	 drink 	 ing 	 	water	.
 be 	 low 	 	the	surface	there	is	hard	 s 	 al 	 ine 	 	water	.
but	now	you	can	have	 th 	 is 	 	for	year	round	.
it	's	two	 house 	 s 	 	.
we	often	use	a	term	 call 	 ed 	 	bylaws	.	 be 	 cause 	 	we	are	used	to	get	written	 thing 	 s 	 	.
but	here	it	is	unwritten	by	law	.
and	people	made	 the 	 ir 	 	house	,	and	the	water	 s 	 to 	 rage 	 	 tank 	 s 	 	.
these	raised	up	 platform 	 s 	 	just	like	 th 	 is 	 	stage	.
in	fact	they	go	15	feet	deep	,	and	collect	rain	water	from	roof	,	there	is	a	small	pipe	,	and	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 court 	 yard 	 	.	it	can	 al 	 so 	 	harvest	 some 	 thing 	 	like	25,000	in	a	good	monsoon	.
 an 	 other 	 	big	one	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	of	course	out	of	the	 hard 	 core 	 	desert	area	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	near	jaipur	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	jaigarh	fort	.
and	it	can	collect	six	million	 gallon 	 s 	 	of	 rain 	 water 	 	in	one	season	.
the	age	is	400	 year 	 s 	 	.
so	,	since	400	 year 	 s 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	giving	you	 al 	 most 	 	six	million	 gallon 	 s 	 	of	water	per	season	.
you	can	 calcul 	 ate 	 	the	price	of	that	water	.
it	 draw 	 s 	 	water	from	15	 kilometer 	 s 	 	of	 can 	 al 	 s 	 	.
you	can	see	a	modern	road	,	 hard 	 ly 	 	50	 year 	 s 	 	old	.	it	can	break	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	.	but	 th 	 is 	 	400	year	old	 can 	 al 	 	,	which	 draw 	 s 	 	water	,	it	is	 maintain 	 ed 	 	for	so	 man 	 y 	 	 generation 	 s 	 	.
of	course	if	you	want	to	go	 in 	 side 	 	,	the	two	 door 	 s 	 	are	 lock 	 ed 	 	.	but	they	can	be	 open 	 ed 	 	for	ted	people	.
and	we	request	them	.
you	can	see	person	coming	up	with	two	canisters	of	water	.
and	the	water	level	--	these	are	not	empty	canisters	--
water	level	is	right	up	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	can	 en 	 vy 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 municipal 	 ities 	 	,	the	color	,	the	taste	,	the	 pur 	 ity 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	water	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	they	call	zero	b	type	of	water	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 come 	 s 	 	from	the	 cloud 	 s 	 	,
 pur 	 e 	 	 distill 	 ed 	 	water	.
we	stop	for	a	quick	commercial	break	,	and	then	we	come	back	to	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	 system 	 s 	 	.
the	government	thought	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 back 	 ward 	 	area	and	we	should	 br 	 ing 	 	a	multi	-	million	dollar	project	to	 br 	 ing 	 	water	from	the	himalayas	.
that	's	why	i	 s 	 aid 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	commercial	break	.
but	we	will	come	back	,	once	 aga 	 in 	 	,	to	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	thing	.
so	,	water	from	300	,	400	 kilometer 	 s 	 	away	,	soon	it	 be 	 come 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
in	 man 	 y 	 	 port 	 ions 	 	,	water	hyacinth	 cover 	 ed 	 	these	big	 can 	 al 	 s 	 	like	 any 	 thing 	 	.
of	course	there	are	some	 area 	 s 	 	where	water	is	 reach 	 ing 	 	,
i	'm	not	 say 	 ing 	 	that	it	is	not	 reach 	 ing 	 	at	all	.
but	the	tail	end	,	the	jaisalmer	area	,	you	will	notice	in	bikaner	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	:	where	the	water	hyacinth	could	n't	grow	,	the	sand	is	 flow 	 ing 	 	in	these	 can 	 al 	 s 	 	.
the	 bon 	 us 	 	is	that	you	can	find	 wild 	 life 	 	around	it	.
we	had	full	-	page	 advertise 	 ments 	 	,	some	30	 year 	 s 	 	,	25	 year 	 s 	 	ago	when	 th 	 is 	 	 can 	 al 	 	came	.
they	 s 	 aid 	 	that	throw	away	your	 tradition 	 al 	 	 system 	 s 	 	,	these	new	cement	 tank 	 s 	 	will	supply	you	piped	water	.
it	's	a	dream	.	and	it	 be 	 came 	 	a	dream	 al 	 so 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	soon	the	water	was	not	able	to	reach	these	 area 	 s 	 	.
and	people	 start 	 ed 	 	renovating	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 structure 	 s 	 	.
these	are	all	 tradition 	 al 	 	water	 structure 	 s 	 	,	which	we	wo	n't	be	able	to	explain	in	 s 	 uch 	 	a	short	time	.
but	you	can	see	that	no	woman	is	 stand 	 ing 	 	on	 t 	 hose 	 	.
and	they	are	plaiting	hair	.
jaisalmer	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	heart	of	desert	.
 th 	 is 	 	town	was	 establish 	 ed 	 	800	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	by	that	time	bombay	was	there	,	or	delhi	was	there	,	or	chennai	was	there	,	or	bangalore	was	there	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	terminal	point	for	silk	route	.
well	 connect 	 ed 	 	,	800	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	through	europe	.
 non 	 e 	 	of	us	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	go	to	europe	,	but	jaisalmer	was	well	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	it	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	16	centimeter	area	.
 s 	 uch 	 	a	 limit 	 ed 	 	 rain 	 fall 	 	,	and	highest	 color 	 ful 	 	life	 flourish 	 ed 	 	in	these	 area 	 s 	 	.
you	wo	n't	find	water	in	 th 	 is 	 	slide	.	but	it	is	 in 	 visible 	 	.
 some 	 where 	 	a	stream	or	a	rivulet	is	running	through	here	.
or	,	if	you	want	to	paint	,	you	can	paint	it	blue	 through 	 out 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	every	roof	which	you	see	in	 th 	 is 	 	picture	 collect 	 s 	 	 rain 	 water 	 	 drop 	 s 	 	and	deposit	in	the	rooms	.
but	 a 	 part 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	system	,	they	designed	52	 beaut 	 iful 	 	water	bodies	around	 th 	 is 	 	town	.
and	what	we	call	private	public	 partner 	 ship 	 	you	can	add	 e 	 state 	 	 al 	 so 	 	.
so	,	 e 	 state 	 	,	public	and	private	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	work	together	to	build	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	water	body	.	and	it	's	a	kind	of	water	body	for	all	 season 	 s 	 	.
you	will	admire	it	.	just	 be 	 hold 	 	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	year	.
 whet 	 her 	 	water	level	 go 	 es 	 	up	or	down	,	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	is	there	 through 	 out 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	water	body	,	dried	up	,	of	course	,	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	summer	period	,
but	you	can	see	how	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	 combine 	 s 	 	 engineer 	 ing 	 	with	 aesthetic 	 s 	 	,	with	the	heart	.
these	 statue 	 s 	 	,	 marvel 	 ous 	 	 statue 	 s 	 	,	 give 	 s 	 	you	an	idea	of	water	table	.
when	 th 	 is 	 	rain	 come 	 s 	 	and	the	water	 start 	 s 	 	 fill 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	tank	,	it	will	 sub 	 merge 	 	these	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 statue 	 s 	 
in	what	we	call	in	english	 to 	 day 	 	``	mass	communication	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	was	for	mass	communication	.
 every 	 body 	 	in	the	town	will	know	that	 th 	 is 	 	elephant	 ha 	 s 	 	 drown 	 ed 	 	,	so	water	will	be	there	for	seven	 month 	 s 	 	or	nine	 month 	 s 	 	,	or	12	 month 	 s 	 	.
and	then	they	will	come	and	worship	 th 	 is 	 	pond	,	pay	respect	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 grat 	 itude 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	small	water	body	,	 call 	 ed 	 	the	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	.	it	is	difficult	to	 transl 	 ate 	 	in	english	,
 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	in	my	english	.
but	the	 near 	 est 	 	would	be	``	 glor 	 y 	 	,	``	a	reputation	.
the	reputation	in	desert	of	 th 	 is 	 	small	water	body	is	that	it	never	 d 	 ries 	 	up	.
in	severe	drought	 period 	 s 	 	 no 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	water	body	 get 	 ting 	 	dried	up	.
and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	they	 k 	 new 	 	the	future	 al 	 so 	 	.
it	was	designed	some	150	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
but	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	they	 k 	 new 	 	that	on	sixth	,	november	,	2009	,	there	will	be	a	ted	green	and	blue	session	,	so	they	 paint 	 ed 	 	it	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
dry	water	body	.	children	are	 stand 	 ing 	 	on	a	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	 de 	 vice 	 	to	explain	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	kund	.	we	have	,	in	english	,	surface	water	and	ground	water	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	ground	water	.
you	can	draw	ground	water	from	any	well	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	no	 ordin 	 ary 	 	well	.
it	 squeez 	 e 	 	the	 moist 	 ure 	 	 hid 	 den 	 	in	the	sand	.
and	they	have	 dub 	 bed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	water	 a 	 s 	 	the	third	one	 call 	 ed 	 	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	.
and	there	is	a	 gy 	 ps 	 um 	 	belt	running	 be 	 low 	 	it	.
and	it	was	 deposit 	 ed 	 	by	the	great	mother	earth	,	some	three	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	where	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	 gy 	 ps 	 um 	 	strip	they	can	harvest	 th 	 is 	 	water	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	same	dry	water	body	.
now	,	you	do	n't	find	any	kund	;	they	are	all	 sub 	 merge 	 d 	 	.
but	when	the	water	 go 	 es 	 	down	they	will	be	able	to	draw	water	from	 t 	 hose 	 	 structure 	 s 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	year	.
 th 	 is 	 	year	they	have	 receiv 	 ed 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	six	 centimeter 	 s 	 	.
six	centimeter	of	 rain 	 fall 	 	,	and	they	can	 tele 	 phone 	 	you	that	if	you	find	any	water	problem	in	your	city	,	delhi	,	bombay	,	bangalore	,	mysore	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	come	to	our	area	of	six	 centimeter 	 s 	 	,	we	can	give	you	water	.
how	they	maintain	them	?
there	are	three	 thing 	 s 	 	:	 con 	 cept 	 	,	 plan 	 ning 	 	,	making	the	actual	thing	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	 maintain 	 ing 	 	them	.
it	is	a	structure	for	maintain	,	for	centuries	,	by	 generation 	 s 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	any	 depart 	 ment 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	any	 fund 	 ing 	 	,
so	the	secret	is	``	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	,	``	respect	.
your	own	thing	,	not	personal	 proper 	 ty 	 	,	my	 proper 	 ty 	 	,	every	time	.
so	,	these	stone	 pillar 	 s 	 	will	 re 	 mind 	 	you	that	you	are	 enter 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	water	body	area	.
do	n't	 s 	 pit 	 	,	do	n't	do	 any 	 thing 	 	wrong	,	so	that	the	clean	water	can	be	 collect 	 ed 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	pillar	,	stone	pillar	on	your	right	side	.
if	you	climb	these	three	,	six	 step 	 s 	 	you	will	find	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	nice	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	 d 	 one 	 	in	11th	century	.
and	you	have	to	go	further	down	.
they	say	that	a	picture	is	worth	a	thousand	 word 	 s 	 	,	so	we	can	say	a	thousand	 word 	 s 	 	right	now	,	an	 an 	 other 	 	thousand	 word 	 s 	 	.
if	the	water	table	 go 	 es 	 	down	,	you	will	find	new	 stair 	 s 	 	.
if	it	 come 	 s 	 	up	,	some	of	them	will	be	 sub 	 merge 	 d 	 	.
so	,	 through 	 out 	 	the	year	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	system	will	give	you	some	pleasure	.
three	 side 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 step 	 s 	 	,	on	the	fourth	side	there	is	a	four	-	story	building	where	you	can	organize	 s 	 uch 	 	ted	 con 	 ference 	 s 	 	 any 	 time 	 	.
excuse	me	,	who	built	these	 structure 	 s 	 	?
they	are	in	front	of	you	.
the	best	civil	 engineer 	 s 	 	we	had	,	the	best	 plan 	 ner 	 s 	 	,	the	best	 architect 	 s 	 	.
we	can	say	that	 be 	 cause 	 	of	them	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 fore 	 father 	 s 	 	,	india	could	get	the	first	 engineer 	 ing 	 	college	in	1847	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	no	english	medium	 school 	 s 	 	at	that	time	,	even	no	hindi	 school 	 s 	 	,	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	 school 	 s 	 	.
but	 s 	 uch 	 	people	,	 compel 	 led 	 	to	the	east	india	company	,	which	came	here	for	business	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 dirt 	 y 	 	kind	of	business	...
but	not	to	create	the	 engineer 	 ing 	 	 college 	 s 	 	.	but	 be 	 cause 	 	of	them	,	first	 engineer 	 ing 	 	college	was	 create 	 d 	 	in	a	small	village	,	not	in	the	town	.
the	last	point	,	we	all	know	in	our	 prim 	 ary 	 	 school 	 s 	 	that	that	camel	is	a	ship	of	desert	.
so	,	you	can	find	through	your	jeep	,	a	camel	,	and	a	cart	.
 th 	 is 	 	tire	 come 	 s 	 	from	the	 air 	 plane 	 	.
so	,	look	at	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	from	the	desert	 socie 	 ty 	 	who	can	harvest	 rain 	 water 	 	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	create	 some 	 thing 	 	through	a	tire	from	a	jet	plane	,	and	used	in	a	camel	cart	.
last	picture	,	it	's	a	tattoo	,	2,000	-	 year 	 s 	 	-	old	tattoo	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	using	it	on	 the 	 ir 	 	body	.
tattoo	was	,	at	one	time	,	a	kind	of	a	 black 	 list 	 ed 	 	or	con	thing	,	but	now	it	is	in	thing	.
you	can	copy	 th 	 is 	 	tattoo	.	i	have	some	 post 	 ers 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
the	center	of	life	is	water	.
these	are	the	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 wave 	 s 	 	.
these	are	the	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 stair 	 s 	 	which	we	just	saw	in	one	of	the	 slide 	 s 	 	.
these	are	the	 tree 	 s 	 	.	and	these	are	the	 flower 	 s 	 	which	add	 fragr 	 ance 	 	to	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 mess 	 age 	 	of	desert	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
chris	anderson	:	so	,	first	of	all	,	i	wish	i	had	your	eloquence	,	 tru 	 ly 	 	,	in	any	language	.
these	 artifact 	 s 	 	and	 design 	 s 	 	are	inspiring	.
do	you	 believ 	 e 	 	that	they	can	be	used	 else 	 where 	 	,	that	the	world	can	learn	from	 th 	 is 	 	?
or	is	 th 	 is 	 	just	right	for	 th 	 is 	 	place	?
anupam	mishra	:	no	,	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	idea	is	to	 util 	 ize 	 	water	that	 fall 	 s 	 	on	our	area	.
so	,	the	 pond 	 s 	 	,	the	open	bodies	,	are	 every 	 where 	 	,	right	from	sri	lanka	to	kashmir	,	and	in	other	 part 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	.
and	these	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	,	which	 store 	 d 	 	water	,	there	are	two	type	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
one	 re 	 charge 	 	,	and	one	 store 	 s 	 	.
so	,	it	 depend 	 s 	 	on	the	 terra 	 in 	 	.
but	kund	,	which	uses	the	 gy 	 ps 	 um 	 	belt	,	for	that	you	have	to	go	back	to	your	calendar	,	three	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
if	it	is	there	it	can	be	 d 	 one 	 	right	now	.
 other 	 wise 	 	,	it	ca	n't	be	 d 	 one 	 	.
