 to 	 day 	 	i	want	to	talk	to	you	about	ethnic	conflict	and	civil	war	.
these	are	not	 normal 	 ly 	 	the	most	 cheer 	 ful 	 	of	 top 	 ic 	 s 	 	,	nor	do	they	 general 	 ly 	 	generate	the	kind	of	good	news	that	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	is	about	.
yet	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	is	there	at	 l 	 east 	 	some	good	news	to	be	told	about	 few 	 er 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 conflict 	 s 	 	now	than	two	 decade 	 s 	 	ago	,	but	what	is	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	more	 import 	 ant 	 	is	that	we	 al 	 so 	 	have	come	to	a	much	better	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	what	can	be	 d 	 one 	 	to	further	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	number	of	ethnic	 conflict 	 s 	 	and	civil	 war 	 s 	 	and	the	 suffer 	 ing 	 	that	they	inflict	.
three	 thing 	 s 	 	stand	out	:	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	,	 diploma 	 cy 	 	and	 institution 	 al 	 	design	.	what	i	will	focus	on	in	my	talk	is	why	they	matter	,	how	they	matter	,	and	what	we	can	all	do	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	they	 continu 	 e 	 	to	matter	in	the	right	ways	,	that	is	,	how	all	of	us	can	 con 	 tribute 	 	to	 develop 	 ing 	 	and	 hon 	 ing 	 	the	 skill 	 s 	 	of	local	and	global	 lead 	 ers 	 	to	make	peace	and	to	make	it	last	.
but	let	's	start	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
civil	 war 	 s 	 	have	made	news	 head 	 lines 	 	for	 man 	 y 	 	 decade 	 s 	 	now	,	and	ethnic	 conflict 	 s 	 	in	 part 	 icular 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	a	near	constant	presence	 a 	 s 	 	a	major	 inter 	 national 	 	security	threat	.
for	 near 	 ly 	 	two	 decade 	 s 	 	now	,	the	news	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	bad	and	the	 image 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 haunt 	 ing 	 	.
in	georgia	,	after	 year 	 s 	 	of	 s 	 tale 	 mate 	 	,	we	saw	a	full	-	scale	 resurg 	 ence 	 	of	violence	in	august	,	2008	.
 th 	 is 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	 escal 	 ated 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	five	-	day	war	between	russia	and	georgia	,	 leav 	 ing 	 	georgia	ever	more	 divid 	 ed 	 	.
in	kenya	,	 contest 	 ed 	 	 p 	 resident 	 ial 	 	 election 	 s 	 	in	2007	--	we	just	heard	about	them	--	 quick 	 ly 	 	led	to	high	 level 	 s 	 	of	inter	-	ethnic	violence	and	the	 kill 	 ing 	 	and	 dis 	 placement 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	.	in	sri	lanka	,	a	 decade 	 s 	 	-	long	civil	war	between	the	tamil	 minor 	 ity 	 	and	the	sinhala	 major 	 ity 	 	led	to	a	 blood 	 y 	 	climax	in	2009	,	after	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 a 	 s 	 	100,000	people	had	 be 	 en 	 	 kill 	 ed 	 	since	1983	.
in	kyrgyzstan	,	just	over	the	last	few	 week 	 s 	 	,	unprecedented	 level 	 s 	 	of	violence	 occur 	 red 	 	between	ethnic	kyrgyz	and	ethnic	uzbeks	.
 hundred 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 kill 	 ed 	 	,	and	more	than	100,000	 dis 	 place 	 d 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 man 	 y 	 	ethnic	uzbeks	who	 fl 	 ed 	 	to	 neighbor 	 ing 	 	uzbekistan	.	in	the	middle	east	,	conflict	between	israelis	and	palestinians	 continu 	 es 	 	 un 	 ab 	 ated 	 	,
and	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	ever	more	difficult	to	see	how	,	just	how	a	possible	,	 sustain 	 able 	 	solution	can	be	 achiev 	 ed 	 	.
darfur	may	have	 s 	 lipped 	 	from	the	news	 head 	 lines 	 	,	but	the	 kill 	 ing 	 	and	 dis 	 placement 	 	there	 continu 	 es 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	and	the	 she 	 er 	 	human	 mis 	 ery 	 	that	it	 create 	 s 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	 fat 	 hom 	 	.
and	in	 ir 	 aq 	 	,	 final 	 ly 	 	,	violence	is	on	the	rise	 aga 	 in 	 	,	and	the	country	 ha 	 s 	 	yet	to	form	a	government	four	 month 	 s 	 	after	 it 	 s 	 	last	 parliament 	 ary 	 	 election 	 s 	 	.
but	hang	on	,	 th 	 is 	 	talk	is	to	be	about	the	good	news	.
so	are	these	now	the	 image 	 s 	 	of	the	past	?
well	,	 not 	 with 	 stand 	 ing 	 	the	 gloom 	 y 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	from	the	middle	east	,	darfur	,	 ir 	 aq 	 	,	 else 	 where 	 	,	there	is	a	 long 	 er 	 	-	term	trend	that	 do 	 es 	 	represent	some	good	news	.
over	the	past	two	 decade 	 s 	 	,	since	the	end	of	the	cold	war	,	there	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	an	 over 	 all 	 	decline	in	the	number	of	civil	 war 	 s 	 	.
since	the	high	in	the	early	1990s	,	with	about	50	 s 	 uch 	 	civil	 war 	 s 	 	 on 	 going 	 	,	we	now	have	30	percent	 few 	 er 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 conflict 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
the	number	of	people	 kill 	 ed 	 	in	civil	 war 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	is	much	lower	 to 	 day 	 	than	it	was	a	decade	ago	or	two	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	trend	is	less	 un 	 ambigu 	 ous 	 	.
the	highest	level	of	 death 	 s 	 	on	the	 battle 	 field 	 	was	 record 	 ed 	 	between	1998	and	2001	,	with	about	80,000	 soldier 	 s 	 	,	 police 	 men 	 	and	 rebel 	 s 	 	 kill 	 ed 	 	every	year	.
the	 low 	 est 	 	number	of	 combat 	 ant 	 	 casual 	 ties 	 	 occur 	 red 	 	in	2003	,
with	just	20,000	 kill 	 ed 	 	.
 de 	 spite 	 	the	up	and	down	since	then	,	the	 over 	 all 	 	trend	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 import 	 ant 	 	bit	--	 clear 	 ly 	 	 point 	 s 	 	 down 	 ward 	 	for	the	past	two	 decade 	 s 	 	.
the	news	about	 civil 	 ian 	 	 casual 	 ties 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	less	bad	than	it	used	to	be	.
from	over	12,000	 civil 	 ians 	 	 de 	 liberate 	 ly 	 	 kill 	 ed 	 	in	civil	 war 	 s 	 	in	1997	and	1998	,	a	decade	 lat 	 er 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	figure	 stand 	 s 	 	at	4,000	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 de 	 crease 	 	by	two	-	 third 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	decline	would	be	even	more	obvious	if	we	 factor 	 ed 	 	in	the	genocide	in	rwanda	in	1994	.
but	then	800,000	 civil 	 ians 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 laughter 	 ed 	 	in	a	matter	of	just	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	 certain 	 ly 	 	is	an	 accomplish 	 ment 	 	that	must	never	be	 surpass 	 ed 	 	.
what	is	 al 	 so 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	is	to	note	that	these	 figure 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	tell	part	of	the	story	.
they	exclude	people	that	 di 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 con 	 sequence 	 	of	civil	war	,	from	 hung 	 er 	 	or	disease	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	.	and	they	 al 	 so 	 	do	not	 proper 	 ly 	 	account	for	 civil 	 ian 	 	 suffer 	 ing 	 	more	 general 	 ly 	 	.
torture	,	rape	and	ethnic	 clean 	 s 	 ing 	 	have	 be 	 come 	 	 high 	 ly 	 	effective	,	if	often	non	-	lethal	,	 weapon 	 s 	 	in	civil	war	.
to	put	it	 different 	 ly 	 	,	for	the	 civil 	 ians 	 	that	suffer	the	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	of	ethnic	conflict	and	civil	war	,	there	is	no	good	war	and	there	is	no	bad	peace	.
thus	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	every	 civil 	 ian 	 	 kill 	 ed 	 	,	 ma 	 im 	 ed 	 	,	 rap 	 ed 	 	,	or	 torture 	 d 	 	is	one	too	 man 	 y 	 	,	the	fact	that	the	number	of	 civil 	 ian 	 	 casual 	 ties 	 	is	 clear 	 ly 	 	lower	 to 	 day 	 	than	it	was	a	decade	ago	,	is	good	news	.
so	,	we	have	 few 	 er 	 	 conflict 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	in	which	 few 	 er 	 	people	get	 kill 	 ed 	 	.
and	the	big	question	,	of	course	,	is	why	?
in	some	 case 	 s 	 	,	there	is	a	 militar 	 y 	 	 vict 	 ory 	 	of	one	side	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	solution	of	 sort 	 s 	 	,	but	 rare 	 ly 	 	is	it	one	that	 come 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	human	 cost 	 s 	 	or	 human 	 itarian 	 	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	.
the	defeat	of	the	tamil	 tiger 	 s 	 	in	sri	lanka	is	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	the	most	 re 	 cent 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	we	have	 s 	 een 	 	similar	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	 militar 	 y 	 	 solution 	 s 	 	in	the	balkans	,	in	the	south	caucasus	and	 a 	 cross 	 	most	of	africa	.
at	 time 	 s 	 	,	they	are	 compliment 	 ed 	 	by	 negoti 	 ated 	 	 settle 	 ments 	 	,	or	at	 l 	 east 	 	cease	-	fire	 agree 	 ments 	 	,	and	 peace 	 keeper 	 s 	 	are	 deploy 	 ed 	 	.
but	 hard 	 ly 	 	ever	do	they	represent	a	 re 	 sound 	 ing 	 	success	--	bosnia	and	herzegovina	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	more	so	than	georgia	.
but	for	 man 	 y 	 	 part 	 s 	 	of	africa	,	a	 col 	 league 	 	of	mine	once	put	it	 th 	 is 	 	way	,	``	the	cease	-	fire	on	tuesday	night	was	 reach 	 ed 	 	just	in	time	for	the	genocide	to	start	on	wednesday	 morn 	 ing 	 	.	``
but	let	's	look	at	the	good	news	 aga 	 in 	 	.
if	there	's	no	solution	on	the	 battle 	 field 	 	,	three	 factor 	 s 	 	can	account	for	the	 prevent 	 ion 	 	of	ethnic	conflict	and	civil	war	,	or	for	 sustain 	 able 	 	peace	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	:	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	,	 diploma 	 cy 	 	and	 institution 	 al 	 	design	.	take	the	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 north 	 ern 	 	ireland	.	 de 	 spite 	 	centuries	of	 anim 	 os 	 ity 	 	,	 decade 	 s 	 	of	violence	and	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	 kill 	 ed 	 	,	1998	saw	the	 con 	 clusion 	 	of	an	historic	 agree 	 ment 	 	.
 it 	 s 	 	 initi 	 al 	 	version	was	 skill 	 fully 	 	 mediate 	 d 	 	by	senator	george	mitchell	.
 cruci 	 ally 	 	,	for	the	long	-	term	success	of	the	peace	process	in	 north 	 ern 	 	ireland	,	he	 impose 	 d 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	 condition 	 s 	 	for	the	 particip 	 ation 	 	and	 negoti 	 ations 	 	.	central	among	them	,	a	 commit 	 ment 	 	to	 exclusive 	 ly 	 	 peace 	 ful 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	.
 sub 	 sequent 	 	 re 	 vision 	 s 	 	of	the	 agree 	 ment 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 facilitate 	 d 	 	by	the	british	and	irish	 government 	 s 	 	,	who	never	 wave 	 red 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 determi 	 nation 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	peace	and	 st 	 ability 	 	to	 north 	 ern 	 	ireland	.
the	core	 institution 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	put	in	place	in	1998	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 mod 	 ification 	 s 	 	in	2006	and	2008	 we 	 re 	 	 high 	 ly 	 	 innov 	 ative 	 	and	 allow 	 ed 	 	all	conflict	 part 	 ies 	 	to	see	 the 	 ir 	 	core	 concern 	 s 	 	and	 demand 	 s 	 	 address 	 ed 	 	.	the	 agree 	 ment 	 	 combine 	 s 	 	a	power	-	sharing	 arrange 	 ment 	 	in	 north 	 ern 	 	ireland	with	cross	-	border	 institution 	 s 	 	that	link	belfast	and	dublin	and	thus	 recogn 	 ize 	 s 	 	the	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	irish	dimension	of	the	conflict	.
and	 significant 	 ly 	 	,	there	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	clear	focus	on	both	the	 right 	 s 	 	of	 individual 	 s 	 	and	the	 right 	 s 	 	of	 commun 	 ities 	 	.	the	 pro 	 vision 	 s 	 	in	the	 agree 	 ment 	 	may	be	complex	,	but	so	is	the	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	conflict	.

who	ever	could	have	 imagin 	 ed 	 	ian	paisley	and	martin	mcguinness	 joint 	 ly 	 	 govern 	 ing 	 	 north 	 ern 	 	ireland	 a 	 s 	 	first	and	 de 	 put 	 y 	 	first	 mini 	 ster 	 	?

by	no	 mean 	 s 	 	.
the	 end 	 ing 	 	of	liberia	's	long	-	 last 	 ing 	 	civil	war	in	2003	 illustr 	 ates 	 	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	,	 diploma 	 cy 	 	and	 institution 	 al 	 	design	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	the	 success 	 ful 	 	 prevent 	 ion 	 	of	a	full	-	scale	civil	war	in	macedonia	in	2001	,	or	the	 success 	 ful 	 	 end 	 ing 	 	of	the	conflict	in	aceh	in	indonesia	in	2005	.
in	all	three	 case 	 s 	 	,	local	 lead 	 ers 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 will 	 ing 	 	and	able	to	make	peace	,	the	 inter 	 national 	 	community	stood	ready	to	help	them	 negoti 	 ate 	 	and	implement	an	 agree 	 ment 	 	,	and	the	 institution 	 s 	 	have	lived	up	to	the	promise	that	they	held	on	the	day	they	 we 	 re 	 	 agree 	 d 	 	.

not	all	the	 issue 	 s 	 	that	 need 	 ed 	 	to	be	resolved	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 cover 	 ed 	 	in	the	 agree 	 ments 	 	.
 ra 	 ther 	 	,	local	 lead 	 ers 	 	 commit 	 ted 	 	to	 re 	 visit 	 ing 	 	them	 lat 	 er 	 	on	.
yet	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 grasp 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	,	local	and	 inter 	 national 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	soon	 dis 	 engag 	 ed 	 	and	 be 	 came 	 	 distract 	 ed 	 	by	the	second	 in 	 tifada 	 	,	the	 event 	 s 	 	of	9/11	and	the	 war 	 s 	 	in	afghanistan	and	 ir 	 aq 	 	.

a	final	 ex 	 ample 	 	:	kosovo	.
the	failure	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	a	 negoti 	 ated 	 	solution	for	kosovo	and	the	violence	,	tension	and	de	 fact 	 o 	 	 part 	 ition 	 	that	 result 	 ed 	 	from	it	have	 the 	 ir 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	different	 factor 	 s 	 	.
central	among	them	are	three	.
first	,	the	 in 	 trans 	 ig 	 ence 	 	of	local	 lead 	 ers 	 	to	settle	for	 noth 	 ing 	 	less	than	 the 	 ir 	 	 maxim 	 um 	 	 demand 	 s 	 	.
second	,	an	 inter 	 national 	 	 diplomat 	 ic 	 	effort	that	was	 ham 	 per 	 ed 	 	from	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	by	western	support	for	kosovo	's	 in 	 depend 	 ence 	 	.
and	third	,	a	lack	of	 imagin 	 ation 	 	when	it	came	to	 design 	 ing 	 	 institution 	 s 	 	that	could	have	 address 	 ed 	 	the	 concern 	 s 	 	of	serbs	and	albanians	 a 	 like 	 	.
by	the	same	 to 	 ken 	 	--	and	here	we	have	some	good	news	 aga 	 in 	 	--	the	 ver 	 y 	 	fact	that	there	is	a	high	-	level	,	well	-	 resource 	 d 	 	 inter 	 national 	 	presence	in	kosovo	and	the	balkans	region	more	 general 	 ly 	 	and	the	fact	that	local	 lead 	 ers 	 	on	both	 side 	 s 	 	have	 show 	 ed 	 	 relat 	 ive 	 	restraint	,	 explain 	 s 	 	why	 thing 	 s 	 	have	not	 be 	 en 	 	 wo 	 rse 	 	over	the	past	two	 year 	 s 	 	since	2008	.
so	even	in	 situ 	 ations 	 	where	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	are	less	than	optimal	,	local	 lead 	 ers 	 	and	 inter 	 national 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	have	a	choice	,	and	they	can	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	for	the	better	.
a	cold	war	is	not	 a 	 s 	 	good	 a 	 s 	 	a	cold	peace	,	but	a	cold	peace	is	still	better	than	a	hot	war	.
good	news	is	 al 	 so 	 	about	 learn 	 ing 	 	the	right	 less 	 on 	 	.
so	what	then	 distinguish 	 es 	 	the	israeli	/	palestinian	conflict	from	that	in	 north 	 ern 	 	ireland	,	or	the	civil	war	in	sudan	from	that	in	liberia	?
both	 success 	 es 	 	and	 failure 	 s 	 	teach	us	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 critical 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	need	to	bear	in	mind	if	we	want	the	good	news	to	 continu 	 e 	 	.
first	,	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	.	in	the	same	way	in	which	ethnic	conflict	and	civil	war	are	not	natural	but	man	-	made	 disaster 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 prevent 	 ion 	 	and	 settle 	 ment 	 	 do 	 es 	 	not	happen	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	either	.
 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 cap 	 able 	 	,	 determine 	 d 	 	and	 vision 	 ary 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	 commit 	 ment 	 	to	peace	.
 lead 	 ers 	 	need	to	connect	to	each	other	and	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 follow 	 ers 	 	,	and	they	need	to	 br 	 ing 	 	them	 a 	 long 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 peace 	 ful 	 	future	.
second	,	 diploma 	 cy 	 	.
 diploma 	 cy 	 	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	well	 resource 	 d 	 	,	 sustain 	 ed 	 	,	and	 app 	 ly 	 	the	right	mix	of	 incentive 	 s 	 	and	 pressure 	 s 	 	on	 lead 	 ers 	 	and	 follow 	 ers 	 	.
it	 need 	 s 	 	to	help	them	reach	an	 equi 	 table 	 	 com 	 promise 	 	,	and	it	 need 	 s 	 	to	ensure	that	a	broad	 coal 	 ition 	 	of	local	,	 region 	 al 	 	and	 inter 	 national 	 	 support 	 ers 	 	help	them	implement	 the 	 ir 	 	 agree 	 ment 	 	.
third	,	 institution 	 al 	 	design	.	 institution 	 al 	 	design	 requir 	 es 	 	a	keen	focus	on	 issue 	 s 	 	,	 innov 	 ative 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	and	 flex 	 ible 	 	and	well	-	funded	 implement 	 ation 	 	.
conflict	 part 	 ies 	 	need	to	move	away	from	 maxim 	 um 	 	 demand 	 s 	 	and	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	a	 com 	 promise 	 	that	 recogn 	 ize 	 s 	 	each	other	's	 need 	 s 	 	.
and	they	need	to	think	about	the	 sub 	 stance 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 agree 	 ment 	 	much	more	than	about	the	 label 	 s 	 	they	want	to	attach	to	them	.
conflict	 part 	 ies 	 	 al 	 so 	 	need	to	be	prepared	to	return	to	the	 negoti 	 ation 	 	table	if	the	 agree 	 ment 	 	 implement 	 ation 	 	 stall 	 s 	 	.
for	me	 personal 	 ly 	 	,	the	most	critical	 less 	 on 	 	of	all	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	local	 commit 	 ment 	 	to	peace	is	all	-	 import 	 ant 	 	,	but	it	is	often	not	 en 	 ough 	 	to	prevent	or	end	violence	.
yet	,	no	amount	of	 diploma 	 cy 	 	or	 institution 	 al 	 	design	can	make	up	for	local	 failure 	 s 	 	and	the	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	that	they	have	.
 there 	 fore 	 	,	we	must	invest	in	 develop 	 ing 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	,	 lead 	 ers 	 	that	have	the	 skill 	 s 	 	,	vision	and	 determi 	 nation 	 	to	make	peace	.
 lead 	 ers 	 	,	in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	that	people	will	trust	and	that	they	will	want	to	follow	even	if	that	 mean 	 s 	 	making	hard	 choice 	 s 	 	.
a	final	thought	:	 end 	 ing 	 	civil	 war 	 s 	 	is	a	process	that	is	 frau 	 ght 	 	with	 danger 	 s 	 	,	 frust 	 ration 	 s 	 	and	 set 	 back 	 s 	 	.	it	often	 take 	 s 	 	a	generation	to	accomplish	,	but	it	 al 	 so 	 	 requir 	 es 	 	us	,	 to 	 day 	 	's	generation	,	to	take	 respons 	 ibility 	 	and	to	learn	the	right	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	about	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	,	 diploma 	 cy 	 	and	 institution 	 al 	 	design	,	so	that	the	child	 soldier 	 s 	 	of	 to 	 day 	 	can	 be 	 come 	 	the	children	of	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	.
thank	you	.
