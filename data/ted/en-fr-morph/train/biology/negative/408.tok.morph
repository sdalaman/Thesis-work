 un 	 less 	 	we	do	 some 	 thing 	 	to	prevent	it	,	over	the	next	40	 year 	 s 	 	we	're	facing	an	 epi 	 demic 	 	of	 neuro 	 logic 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	on	a	global	scale	.
a	 cheer 	 y 	 	thought	.
on	 th 	 is 	 	map	,	every	country	that	's	 color 	 ed 	 	blue	 ha 	 s 	 	more	than	20	percent	of	 it 	 s 	 	population	over	the	age	of	65	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	world	we	live	in	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	world	your	children	will	live	in	.
for	12,000	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	 distribut 	 ion 	 	of	 age 	 s 	 	in	the	human	population	 ha 	 s 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	like	a	pyramid	,	with	the	 old 	 est 	 	on	top	.
it	's	 al 	 ready 	 	 flatten 	 ing 	 	out	.
by	2050	,	it	's	going	to	be	a	column	and	will	start	to	 in 	 vert 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	why	it	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
the	average	 life 	 span 	 	's	more	than	 double 	 d 	 	since	1840	,	and	it	's	increasing	 current 	 ly 	 	at	the	rate	of	about	five	 hour 	 s 	 	every	day	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	why	that	's	not	 entire 	 ly 	 	a	good	thing	:	 be 	 cause 	 	over	the	age	of	65	,	your	risk	of	 get 	 ting 	 	alzheimer	's	or	parkinson	's	disease	will	 in 	 crease 	 	 exponential 	 ly 	 	.
by	2050	,	there	'll	be	about	32	million	people	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	over	the	age	of	80	,	and	 un 	 less 	 	we	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	it	,	half	of	them	will	have	alzheimer	's	disease	and	three	million	more	will	have	parkinson	's	disease	.
right	now	,	 t 	 hose 	 	and	other	 neuro 	 logic 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	--	for	which	we	have	no	cure	or	 prevent 	 ion 	 	--	cost	about	a	third	of	a	trillion	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	.
it	will	be	well	over	a	trillion	 dollar 	 s 	 	by	2050	.
alzheimer	's	disease	 start 	 s 	 	when	a	protein	that	should	be	 fold 	 ed 	 	up	 proper 	 ly 	 	 mis 	 fold 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	kind	of	 de 	 ment 	 ed 	 	origami	.
so	one	approach	we	're	taking	is	to	try	to	design	 drug 	 s 	 	that	function	like	 mole 	 cular 	 	 s 	 co 	 tch 	 	tape	,	to	hold	the	protein	 in 	 to 	 	 it 	 s 	 	proper	shape	.
that	would	keep	it	from	 form 	 ing 	 	the	 tangle 	 s 	 	that	seem	to	kill	large	 section 	 s 	 	of	the	brain	when	they	do	.
 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	other	 neuro 	 logic 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	which	affect	 ver 	 y 	 	different	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	brain	 al 	 so 	 	show	 tangle 	 s 	 	of	 mis 	 fold 	 ed 	 	protein	,	which	 suggest 	 s 	 	that	the	approach	might	be	a	general	one	,	and	might	be	used	to	cure	 man 	 y 	 	 neuro 	 logic 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	,	not	just	alzheimer	's	disease	.
there	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	 fasci 	 nating 	 	 connect 	 ion 	 	to	cancer	here	,	 be 	 cause 	 	people	with	 neuro 	 logic 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	low	incidence	of	most	 cancer 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 connect 	 ion 	 	that	most	people	are	n't	 pur 	 suing 	 	right	now	,	but	which	we	're	 fascinate 	 d 	 	by	.
most	of	the	 import 	 ant 	 	and	all	of	the	creative	work	in	 th 	 is 	 	area	is	 be 	 ing 	 	funded	by	private	 philanthro 	 pies 	 	.
and	there	's	tremendous	scope	for	 add 	 ition 	 al 	 	private	help	here	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	government	 ha 	 s 	 	 drop 	 ped 	 	the	ball	on	much	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	'm	 af 	 raid 	 	.
in	the	 mean 	 time 	 	,	while	we	're	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	to	happen	,	here	's	what	you	can	do	for	 your 	 self 	 	.
if	you	want	to	lower	your	risk	of	parkinson	's	disease	,	 c 	 affe 	 ine 	 	is	 protect 	 ive 	 	to	some	 ex 	 tent 	 	;	 no 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	why	.
head	 inju 	 ries 	 	are	bad	for	you	.	they	lead	to	parkinson	's	disease	.
and	the	 av 	 ian 	 	flu	is	 al 	 so 	 	not	a	good	idea	.
 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	 protect 	 ing 	 	 your 	 self 	 	against	alzheimer	's	disease	,	well	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	fish	oil	 ha 	 s 	 	the	effect	of	 reduc 	 ing 	 	your	risk	for	alzheimer	's	disease	.
you	should	 al 	 so 	 	keep	your	blood	pressure	down	,	 be 	 cause 	 	chronic	high	blood	pressure	is	the	 big 	 gest 	 	single	risk	factor	for	alzheimer	's	disease	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	the	 big 	 gest 	 	risk	factor	for	glaucoma	,	which	is	just	alzheimer	's	disease	of	the	eye	.
and	of	course	,	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	cognitive	 effect 	 s 	 	,	``	use	it	or	lose	it	``	 appli 	 es 	 	,	so	you	want	to	stay	 ment 	 ally 	 	 stimul 	 ated 	 	.
but	 he 	 y 	 	,	you	're	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	me	.
so	you	've	got	that	 cover 	 ed 	 	.
and	one	final	thing	.	wish	people	like	me	luck	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	the	clock	is	 tick 	 ing 	 	for	all	of	us	.
thank	you	.
