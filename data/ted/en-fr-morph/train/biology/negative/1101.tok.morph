i	was	 on 	 ly 	 	four	 year 	 s 	 	old	when	i	saw	my	mother	load	a	 wash 	 ing 	 	machine	for	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	time	in	her	life	.
that	was	a	great	day	for	my	mother	.
my	mother	and	father	had	 be 	 en 	 	saving	money	for	 year 	 s 	 	to	be	able	to	buy	that	machine	,
and	the	first	day	it	was	going	to	be	used	,	even	grandma	was	 invit 	 ed 	 	to	see	the	machine	.
and	grandma	was	even	more	 excit 	 ed 	 	.
 through 	 out 	 	her	life	she	had	 be 	 en 	 	 heat 	 ing 	 	water	with	 fire 	 wood 	 	,	and	she	had	hand	 wash 	 ed 	 	 laundr 	 y 	 	for	seven	children	.
and	now	she	was	going	to	watch	 electric 	 ity 	 	do	that	work	.
my	mother	 care 	 fully 	 	 open 	 ed 	 	the	door	,	and	she	 load 	 ed 	 	the	 laundr 	 y 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	machine	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	then	,	when	she	closed	the	door	,	grandma	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	no	,	no	,	no	.	let	me	,	let	me	push	the	button	.	``
and	grandma	 push 	 ed 	 	the	button	,	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	oh	,	fantastic	!
i	want	to	see	 th 	 is 	 	!	give	me	a	chair	!
give	me	a	chair	!	i	want	to	see	it	,	``
and	she	 s 	 at 	 	down	in	front	of	the	machine	,	and	she	 watch 	 ed 	 	the	entire	 wash 	 ing 	 	program	.
she	was	 mesmer 	 ized 	 	.
to	my	 grand 	 mother 	 	,	the	 wash 	 ing 	 	machine	was	a	miracle	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	in	sweden	and	other	rich	 count 	 ries 	 	,	people	are	using	so	 man 	 y 	 	different	 machine 	 s 	 	.
look	,	the	 home 	 s 	 	are	full	of	 machine 	 s 	 	.	i	ca	n't	even	name	them	all	.
and	they	 al 	 so 	 	,	when	they	want	to	travel	,	they	use	 fly 	 ing 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	that	can	take	them	to	remote	 destination 	 s 	 	.
and	yet	,	in	the	world	,	there	are	so	 man 	 y 	 	people	who	still	heat	the	water	on	fire	,	and	they	cook	 the 	 ir 	 	food	on	fire	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	they	do	n't	even	have	 en 	 ough 	 	food	,
and	they	live	 be 	 low 	 	the	poverty	line	.	there	are	two	billion	fellow	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	who	live	on	less	than	two	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	day	.
and	the	 rich 	 est 	 	people	over	there	--	there	's	one	billion	people	--	and	they	live	above	what	i	call	the	``	air	line	,	``	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 s 	 pend 	 	more	than	$	80	a	day	on	 the 	 ir 	 	consumption	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	one	,	two	,	three	billion	people	,
and	 obvious 	 ly 	 	there	are	seven	billion	people	in	the	world	,	so	there	must	be	one	,	two	,	three	,	four	billion	people	more	who	live	in	between	the	poverty	and	the	air	line	.
they	have	 electric 	 ity 	 	,	but	the	question	is	,	how	 man 	 y 	 	have	 wash 	 ing 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	?
i	've	 d 	 one 	 	the	 scru 	 tin 	 y 	 	of	market	data	,	and	i	've	found	that	,	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	the	 wash 	 ing 	 	machine	 ha 	 s 	 	 penetrate 	 d 	 	 be 	 low 	 	the	air	line	,	and	 to 	 day 	 	there	's	an	 add 	 ition 	 al 	 	one	billion	people	out	there	who	live	above	the	``	wash	line	.	``
and	they	 consum 	 e 	 	more	than	$	40	per	day	.
so	two	billion	have	access	to	 wash 	 ing 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	.
and	the	 remain 	 ing 	 	five	billion	,	how	do	they	wash	?
or	,	to	be	more	precise	,	how	do	most	of	the	women	in	the	world	wash	?
 be 	 cause 	 	it	 remain 	 s 	 	hard	work	for	women	to	wash	.
they	wash	like	 th 	 is 	 	:	by	hand	.
it	's	a	hard	,	time	-	 consum 	 ing 	 	labor	,	which	they	have	to	do	for	 hour 	 s 	 	every	week	.
and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	they	 al 	 so 	 	have	to	 br 	 ing 	 	water	from	far	away	to	do	the	 laundr 	 y 	 	at	home	,
or	they	have	to	 br 	 ing 	 	the	 laundr 	 y 	 	away	to	a	stream	far	off	.
and	they	want	the	 wash 	 ing 	 	machine	.
they	do	n't	want	to	 s 	 pend 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	a	large	part	of	 the 	 ir 	 	life	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	hard	work	with	so	 relat 	 ively 	 	low	 product 	 ivity 	 	.	and	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	different	in	 the 	 ir 	 	wish	than	it	was	for	my	grandma	.
look	here	,	two	 generation 	 s 	 	ago	in	sweden	--	 pick 	 ing 	 	water	from	the	stream	,	 heat 	 ing 	 	with	 fire 	 wood 	 	and	 wash 	 ing 	 	like	that	.
they	want	the	 wash 	 ing 	 	machine	in	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	way	.
but	when	i	 lectur 	 e 	 	to	 environment 	 ally 	 	-	 concern 	 ed 	 	 student 	 s 	 	,	they	tell	me	,	``	no	,	 every 	 body 	 	in	the	world	can	not	have	 car 	 s 	 	and	 wash 	 ing 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	.	``	how	can	we	tell	 th 	 is 	 	woman	that	she	ai	n't	going	to	have	a	 wash 	 ing 	 	machine	?
and	then	i	ask	my	 student 	 s 	 	,	i	've	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	--	over	the	last	two	 year 	 s 	 	i	've	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	``	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	 do 	 es 	 	n't	use	a	car	?	``
and	some	of	them	 proud 	 ly 	 	raise	 the 	 ir 	 	hand	and	say	,	``	i	do	n't	use	a	car	.	``	and	then	i	put	the	 re 	 ally 	 	tough	question	:	``	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	hand	-	wash	your	 jean 	 s 	 	and	your	bed	 sheet 	 s 	 	?	``
and	no	one	raised	 the 	 ir 	 	hand	.
even	the	 hard 	 core 	 	in	the	green	 move 	 ment 	 	use	 wash 	 ing 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	.
so	how	come	[	 th 	 is 	 	is	]	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 every 	 one 	 	uses	and	they	think	 other 	 s 	 	will	not	stop	it	?	what	is	special	with	 th 	 is 	 	?
i	had	to	do	an	analysis	about	the	energy	used	in	the	world	.	here	we	are	.
look	here	,	you	see	the	seven	billion	people	up	there	:	the	air	people	,	the	wash	people	,	the	bulb	people	and	the	fire	people	.
one	unit	like	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	energy	unit	of	fossil	fuel	--	oil	,	coal	or	gas	.
that	's	what	most	of	 electric 	 ity 	 	and	the	energy	in	the	world	is	.
and	it	's	12	 unit 	 s 	 	used	in	the	entire	world	,	and	the	 rich 	 est 	 	one	billion	,	they	use	six	of	them	.
half	of	the	energy	is	used	by	one	 seven 	 th 	 	of	the	world	's	population	.
and	these	 one 	 s 	 	who	have	 wash 	 ing 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	,	but	not	a	house	full	of	other	 machine 	 s 	 	,	they	use	two	.
 th 	 is 	 	group	uses	three	,	one	each	.	and	they	 al 	 so 	 	have	 electric 	 ity 	 	.	and	over	there	they	do	n't	even	use	one	each	.	that	 make 	 s 	 	12	of	them	.	but	the	main	concern	for	the	 environment 	 ally 	 	-	 interest 	 ed 	 	 student 	 s 	 	--	and	they	are	right	--	is	about	the	future	.
what	are	the	 trend 	 s 	 	?	if	we	just	 pro 	 long 	 	the	 trend 	 s 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	any	real	 advance 	 d 	 	analysis	,	to	2050	,	there	are	two	 thing 	 s 	 	that	can	 in 	 crease 	 	the	energy	use	.
first	,	population	growth	.
second	,	economic	growth	.
population	growth	will	 main 	 ly 	 	occur	among	the	 poor 	 est 	 	people	here	 be 	 cause 	 	they	have	high	child	 mortal 	 ity 	 	and	they	have	 man 	 y 	 	children	per	woman	.
and	[	with	]	that	you	will	get	two	extra	,	but	that	wo	n't	change	the	energy	use	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
what	will	happen	is	economic	growth	.
the	best	of	here	in	the	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	--	i	call	them	the	new	east	--	they	will	jump	the	air	line	.
``	wopp	!	``	they	will	say	.	and	they	will	start	to	use	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	the	old	west	are	 do 	 ing 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	.
and	these	people	,	they	want	the	 wash 	 ing 	 	machine	.
i	told	you	.	they	'll	go	there	.
and	they	will	double	 the 	 ir 	 	energy	use	.
and	we	hope	that	the	poor	people	will	get	 in 	 to 	 	the	electric	light	.
and	they	'll	get	a	two	-	child	family	 with 	 out 	 	a	stop	in	population	growth	.
but	the	total	energy	consumption	will	 in 	 crease 	 	to	22	 unit 	 s 	 	.
and	these	22	 unit 	 s 	 	--	still	the	 rich 	 est 	 	people	use	most	of	it	.
so	what	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 d 	 one 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	the	risk	,	the	high	 prob 	 ability 	 	of	climate	change	is	real	.
it	's	real	.
of	course	they	must	be	more	energy	-	efficient	.
they	must	change	behavior	in	some	way	.
they	must	 al 	 so 	 	start	to	produce	green	energy	,	much	more	green	energy	.	but	 un 	 til 	 	they	have	the	same	energy	consumption	per	person	,	they	should	n't	give	 ad 	 vice 	 	to	 other 	 s 	 	--	what	to	do	and	what	not	to	do	.	here	we	can	get	more	green	energy	all	over	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	hope	may	happen	.
it	's	a	real	 challeng 	 e 	 	in	the	future	.
but	i	can	assure	you	that	 th 	 is 	 	woman	in	the	favela	in	rio	,	she	 want 	 s 	 	a	 wash 	 ing 	 	machine	.
she	's	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	about	her	 mini 	 ster 	 	of	energy	that	 provide 	 d 	 	 electric 	 ity 	 	to	 every 	 one 	 	--	so	happy	that	she	even	 vot 	 ed 	 	for	her	.
and	she	 be 	 came 	 	dilma	rousseff	,	the	 p 	 resident 	 	-	elect	of	one	of	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 demo 	 cracies 	 	in	the	world	--	moving	from	 mini 	 ster 	 	of	energy	to	 p 	 resident 	 	.
if	you	have	 demo 	 cracy 	 	,	people	will	vote	for	 wash 	 ing 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	.
they	love	them	.
and	what	's	the	magic	with	them	?
my	mother	 explain 	 ed 	 	the	magic	with	 th 	 is 	 	machine	the	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	first	day	.
she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	now	hans	,	we	have	 load 	 ed 	 	the	 laundr 	 y 	 	.	the	machine	will	make	the	work	.
and	now	we	can	go	to	the	library	.	``
 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	magic	:	you	load	the	 laundr 	 y 	 	,	and	what	do	you	get	out	of	the	machine	?
children	's	 book 	 s 	 	.
and	mother	got	time	to	read	for	me	.
she	 love 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.	i	got	the	``	abc	's	``	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	i	 start 	 ed 	 	my	 care 	 er 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	professor	,	when	my	mother	had	time	to	read	for	me	.
and	she	 al 	 so 	 	got	 book 	 s 	 	for	 her 	 self 	 	.
she	 manage 	 d 	 	to	 stud 	 y 	 	english	and	learn	that	 a 	 s 	 	a	foreign	language	.
and	she	read	so	 man 	 y 	 	 novel 	 s 	 	,	so	 man 	 y 	 	different	 novel 	 s 	 	here	.
and	we	 re 	 ally 	 	,	we	 re 	 ally 	 	 love 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	machine	.
and	what	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	my	mother	and	me	,	``	thank	you	 industrial 	 ization 	 	.	thank	you	steel	mill	.
thank	you	power	station	.
