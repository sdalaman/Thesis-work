i	want	you	now	to	imagine	a	 wear 	 able 	 	robot	that	 give 	 s 	 	you	 super 	 human 	 	abilities	,	or	 an 	 other 	 	one	that	 take 	 s 	 	wheelchair	 user 	 s 	 	up	 stand 	 ing 	 	and	 walk 	 ing 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
we	at	berkeley	 bio 	 nic 	 s 	 	call	these	 robot 	 s 	 	 exo 	 skeleton 	 s 	 	.
these	are	 noth 	 ing 	 	else	than	 some 	 thing 	 	that	you	put	on	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	and	it	will	give	you	extra	strength	,	and	it	will	further	enhance	your	speed	,	and	it	will	help	you	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	to	manage	your	balance	.
it	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	true	 integ 	 ration 	 	of	the	man	and	the	machine	.
but	not	 on 	 ly 	 	that	--	it	will	integrate	and	network	you	to	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	and	other	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	out	there	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	just	not	some	blue	sky	 think 	 ing 	 	.
to	show	you	now	what	we	are	 work 	 ing 	 	on	by	 start 	 ing 	 	out	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	american	soldier	,	that	on	average	 do 	 es 	 	carry	about	100	 lb 	 s 	 	.	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 back 	 s 	 	,	and	they	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	carry	more	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	.
 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 result 	 ing 	 	in	some	major	 complic 	 ations 	 	--	back	 inju 	 ries 	 	,	30	percent	of	them	--	chronic	back	 inju 	 ries 	 	.
so	we	thought	we	would	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	 challeng 	 e 	 	and	create	an	exoskeleton	that	would	help	deal	with	 th 	 is 	 	issue	.
so	let	me	now	 introduc 	 e 	 	to	you	hulc	--	or	the	human	universal	load	 car 	 rier 	 	.
soldier	:	with	the	hulc	exoskeleton	,	i	can	carry	200	 lb 	 s 	 	.	over	 vari 	 ed 	 	 terra 	 in 	 	for	 man 	 y 	 	 hour 	 s 	 	.
 it 	 s 	 	 flex 	 ible 	 	design	 allow 	 s 	 	for	deep	_UNK_	,	 crawl 	 s 	 	and	high	-	 ag 	 ility 	 	 move 	 ments 	 	.
it	 sense 	 s 	 	what	i	want	to	do	,	where	i	want	to	go	,	and	then	 augment 	 s 	 	my	strength	and	 endur 	 ance 	 	.
eythor	bender	:	we	are	ready	with	our	industry	partner	to	 introduc 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	new	exoskeleton	 th 	 is 	 	year	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	for	real	.
now	let	's	turn	our	 head 	 s 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	wheelchair	 user 	 s 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	'm	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	passionate	about	.
there	are	68	million	people	 estimate 	 d 	 	to	be	in	 wheelchair 	 s 	 	 world 	 wide 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	about	one	percent	of	the	total	population	.
and	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 conserv 	 ative 	 	estimate	.
we	are	 talk 	 ing 	 	here	about	,	 often 	 time 	 s 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	young	 individual 	 s 	 	with	 spin 	 al 	 	cord	 inju 	 ries 	 	,	that	in	the	prime	of	 the 	 ir 	 	life	--	20s	,	30s	,	40s	--	hit	a	wall	and	the	wheelchair	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	option	.
but	it	is	 al 	 so 	 	the	aging	population	that	is	 multi 	 ply 	 ing 	 	in	 number 	 s 	 	.
and	the	 on 	 ly 	 	option	,	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	--	when	it	's	stroke	or	other	 complic 	 ations 	 	--	is	the	wheelchair	.
and	that	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	for	the	last	500	 year 	 s 	 	,	since	 it 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	 introduc 	 tion 	 	,	i	must	say	.
so	we	thought	we	would	start	writing	a	brand	new	chapter	of	 mobil 	 ity 	 	.
let	me	now	 introduc 	 e 	 	you	to	elegs	that	is	worn	by	amanda	boxtel	that	19	 year 	 s 	 	ago	was	 spin 	 al 	 	cord	 inju 	 red 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	that	she	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	walk	for	19	 year 	 s 	 	 un 	 til 	 	now	.
amanda	boxtel	:	thank	you	.
eb	:	amanda	is	 wear 	 ing 	 	our	elegs	set	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	 sensor 	 s 	 	.	it	's	 complete 	 ly 	 	non	-	invasive	,	 sensor 	 s 	 	in	the	 crutch 	 es 	 	that	 s 	 end 	 	 signal 	 s 	 	back	to	our	 on 	 board 	 	computer	that	is	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	here	at	her	back	.
there	are	 batt 	 ery 	 	 pack 	 s 	 	here	 a 	 s 	 	well	that	power	 motor 	 s 	 	that	are	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	at	her	 hip 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	her	knee	 joint 	 s 	 	,	that	move	her	forward	in	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	smooth	and	 ver 	 y 	 	natural	 ga 	 it 	 	.
ab	:	i	was	24	 year 	 s 	 	old	and	at	the	top	of	my	game	when	a	freak	_UNK_	while	 down 	 hill 	 	 ski 	 ing 	 	 paralyze 	 d 	 	me	.
in	a	split	second	,	i	lost	all	 sens 	 ation 	 	and	 move 	 ment 	 	 be 	 low 	 	my	 pel 	 vis 	 	.
not	long	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	a	doctor	strode	 in 	 to 	 	my	hospital	room	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	amanda	,	you	'll	never	walk	 aga 	 in 	 	.	``
and	that	was	19	_UNK_	ago	.
he	 rob 	 bed 	 	every	ounce	of	hope	from	my	 be 	 ing 	 	.
 adapt 	 ive 	 	technology	 ha 	 s 	 	since	enabled	me	to	learn	how	to	 down 	 hill 	 	ski	 aga 	 in 	 	,	to	rock	climb	and	even	_UNK_	.
but	 noth 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 invent 	 ed 	 	that	 en 	 able 	 s 	 	me	to	walk	,	 un 	 til 	 	now	.
thank	you	.
eb	:	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	we	have	the	technology	,	we	have	the	 platform 	 s 	 	to	 s 	 it 	 	down	and	have	 discuss 	 ions 	 	with	you	.
it	's	in	our	 hand 	 s 	 	,	and	we	have	all	the	potential	here	to	change	the	 live 	 s 	 	of	future	 generation 	 s 	 	--	not	 on 	 ly 	 	for	the	 soldier 	 s 	 	,	or	for	amanda	here	and	all	the	wheelchair	 user 	 s 	 	,	but	for	 every 	 one 	 	.
