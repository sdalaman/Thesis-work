what	i	thought	i	would	do	is	i	would	start	with	a	simple	request	.
i	'd	like	all	of	you	to	pause	for	a	moment	,	you	 wr 	 etch 	 ed 	 	 weak 	 ling 	 s 	 	,	and	take	stock	of	your	 mis 	 er 	 able 	 	 exist 	 ence 	 	.
now	that	was	the	 ad 	 vice 	 	that	st.	benedict	 g 	 ave 	 	his	 ra 	 ther 	 	 start 	 led 	 	 follow 	 ers 	 	in	the	fifth	century	.
it	was	the	 ad 	 vice 	 	that	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	follow	 my 	 self 	 	when	i	 turn 	 ed 	 	40	.
up	 un 	 til 	 	that	moment	,	i	had	 be 	 en 	 	that	classic	corporate	warrior	--	i	was	eating	too	much	,	i	was	 drink 	 ing 	 	too	much	,	i	was	 work 	 ing 	 	too	hard	and	i	was	 neglect 	 ing 	 	the	family	.
and	i	 decide 	 d 	 	that	i	would	try	and	turn	my	life	around	.
in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	i	 decide 	 d 	 	i	would	try	to	address	the	 thorn 	 y 	 	issue	of	work	-	life	balance	.
so	i	 steppe 	 d 	 	back	from	the	 work 	 force 	 	,	and	i	 s 	 pent 	 	a	year	at	home	with	my	wife	and	four	young	children	.
but	all	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	about	work	-	life	balance	from	that	year	was	that	i	found	it	 quit 	 e 	 	easy	to	balance	work	and	life	when	i	did	n't	have	any	work	.
not	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	skill	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	when	the	money	 run 	 s 	 	out	.
so	i	went	back	to	work	,	and	i	've	 s 	 pent 	 	these	seven	 year 	 s 	 	since	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	with	,	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	and	writing	about	work	-	life	balance	.
and	i	have	four	 observ 	 ations 	 	i	'd	like	to	share	with	you	 to 	 day 	 	.
the	first	is	:	if	 socie 	 ty 	 	's	to	make	any	progress	on	 th 	 is 	 	issue	,	we	need	an	honest	debate	.
but	the	trouble	is	so	 man 	 y 	 	people	talk	so	much	 rub 	 b 	 ish 	 	about	work	-	life	balance	.
all	the	 discuss 	 ions 	 	about	flexi	-	time	or	dress	-	down	fridays	or	 patern 	 ity 	 	 leav 	 e 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	serve	to	mask	the	core	issue	,	which	is	that	certain	job	and	 care 	 er 	 	 choice 	 s 	 	are	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	 in 	 compatible 	 	with	 be 	 ing 	 	 meaning 	 fully 	 	 engag 	 ed 	 	on	a	day	-	to	-	day	 bas 	 is 	 	with	a	young	family	.
now	the	first	step	in	solving	any	problem	is	 acknowledg 	 ing 	 	the	 re 	 ality 	 	of	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	you	're	in	.
and	the	 re 	 ality 	 	of	the	 socie 	 ty 	 	that	we	're	in	is	there	are	 thousand 	 s 	 	and	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	out	there	 lead 	 ing 	 	 live 	 s 	 	of	quiet	,	 s 	 cream 	 ing 	 	 de 	 s 	 per 	 ation 	 	,	where	they	work	long	,	hard	 hour 	 s 	 	at	 job 	 s 	 	they	hate	to	 en 	 able 	 	them	to	buy	 thing 	 s 	 	they	do	n't	need	to	impress	people	they	do	n't	like	.
it	's	my	 content 	 ion 	 	that	going	to	work	on	friday	in	 jean 	 s 	 	and	[	a	]	t	-	shirt	is	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	to	the	nub	of	the	issue	.
the	second	 observ 	 ation 	 	i	'd	like	to	make	is	we	need	to	face	the	truth	that	 government 	 s 	 	and	 corporation 	 s 	 	are	n't	going	to	solve	 th 	 is 	 	issue	for	us	.
we	should	stop	looking	 out 	 side 	 	.	it	's	up	to	us	 a 	 s 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	to	take	control	and	 respons 	 ibility 	 	for	the	type	of	 live 	 s 	 	that	we	want	to	lead	.
if	you	do	n't	design	your	life	,	 some 	 one 	 	else	will	design	it	for	you	,	and	you	may	just	not	like	 the 	 ir 	 	idea	of	balance	.
it	's	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	on	the	world	wide	web	,	is	it	?	i	'm	about	to	get	 fire 	 d 	 	--	it	's	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	that	you	never	put	the	quality	of	your	life	in	the	 hand 	 s 	 	of	a	commercial	corporation	.
now	i	'm	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	here	just	about	the	bad	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	--	the	``	abattoirs	of	the	human	soul	,	``	 a 	 s 	 	i	call	them	.
i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	all	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	commercial	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	are	 inherent 	 ly 	 	designed	to	get	 a 	 s 	 	much	out	of	you	[	 a 	 s 	 	]	they	can	get	away	with	.
it	's	in	 the 	 ir 	 	nature	;	it	's	in	 the 	 ir 	 	dna	;	it	's	what	they	do	--	even	the	good	,	well	-	intentioned	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.
on	the	one	hand	,	 put 	 ting 	 	 child 	 care 	 	 facil 	 ities 	 	in	the	 work 	 place 	 	is	 wonder 	 ful 	 	and	 enlighten 	 ed 	 	.
on	the	other	hand	,	it	's	a	nightmare	--	it	just	 mean 	 s 	 	you	 s 	 pend 	 	more	time	at	the	 blood 	 y 	 	 off 	 ice 	 	.
we	have	to	be	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	setting	and	 en 	 forcing 	 	the	 bound 	 aries 	 	that	we	want	in	our	life	.
the	third	 observ 	 ation 	 	is	we	have	to	be	 care 	 ful 	 	with	the	time	frame	that	we	 choos 	 e 	 	 up 	 on 	 	which	to	 judg 	 e 	 	our	balance	.
before	i	went	back	to	work	after	my	year	at	home	,	i	 s 	 at 	 	down	and	i	wrote	out	a	 detail 	 ed 	 	,	step	-	by	-	step	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	of	the	ideal	 balanc 	 ed 	 	day	that	i	 aspir 	 ed 	 	to	.
and	it	went	like	 th 	 is 	 	:	wake	up	well	 rest 	 ed 	 	after	a	good	night	's	sleep	.
have	 s 	 ex 	 	.
walk	the	dog	.
have	 break 	 fast 	 	with	my	wife	and	children	.
have	 s 	 ex 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
drive	the	 kid 	 s 	 	to	school	on	the	way	to	the	 off 	 ice 	 	.
do	three	 hour 	 s 	 	'	work	.
play	a	 s 	 port 	 	with	a	friend	at	 lunch 	 time 	 	.
do	 an 	 other 	 	three	 hour 	 s 	 	'	work	.
meet	some	 mate 	 s 	 	in	the	pub	for	an	early	 even 	 ing 	 	drink	.
drive	home	for	 d 	 inner 	 	with	my	wife	and	 kid 	 s 	 	.
meditate	for	half	an	hour	.
have	 s 	 ex 	 	.
walk	the	dog	.	have	 s 	 ex 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
go	to	bed	.
how	often	do	you	think	i	have	that	day	?
we	need	to	be	realistic	.
you	ca	n't	do	it	all	in	one	day	.
we	need	to	 e 	 long 	 ate 	 	the	time	frame	 up 	 on 	 	which	we	 judg 	 e 	 	the	balance	in	our	life	,	but	we	need	to	 e 	 long 	 ate 	 	it	 with 	 out 	 	 fall 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	trap	of	the	``	i	'll	have	a	life	when	i	retire	,	when	my	 kid 	 s 	 	have	left	home	,	when	my	wife	 ha 	 s 	 	 divorce 	 d 	 	me	,	my	health	is	 fail 	 ing 	 	,	i	've	got	no	 mate 	 s 	 	or	 interest 	 s 	 	left	.	``	a	day	is	too	short	;	``	after	i	retire	``	is	too	long	.
there	's	got	to	be	a	middle	way	.
a	fourth	 observ 	 ation 	 	:	we	need	to	approach	balance	in	a	 balanc 	 ed 	 	way	.
a	friend	came	to	see	me	last	year	--	and	she	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mind	me	 tell 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	story	--	a	friend	came	to	see	me	last	year	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	nigel	,	i	've	read	your	book	.
and	i	 real 	 ize 	 	that	my	life	is	 complete 	 ly 	 	out	of	balance	.
it	's	 total 	 ly 	 	 dominate 	 d 	 	by	work	.
i	work	10	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	;	i	commute	two	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	.
all	of	my	 relationship 	 s 	 	have	 fail 	 ed 	 	.
there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	in	my	life	 a 	 part 	 	from	my	work	.
so	i	've	 decide 	 d 	 	to	get	a	grip	and	sort	it	out	.
so	i	 join 	 ed 	 	a	gym	.	``	now	i	do	n't	mean	to	mock	,	but	 be 	 ing 	 	a	fit	10	-	hour	-	a	-	day	 off 	 ice 	 	rat	is	n't	more	 balanc 	 ed 	 	;	it	's	more	fit	.
 love 	 ly 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	physical	 exercis 	 e 	 	may	be	,	there	are	other	 part 	 s 	 	to	life	--
there	's	the	intellectual	side	;	there	's	the	 emotion 	 al 	 	side	;	there	's	the	spiritual	side	.
and	to	be	 balanc 	 ed 	 	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	we	have	to	attend	to	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 area 	 s 	 	--	not	just	do	50	stomach	 crunch 	 es 	 	.
now	that	can	be	 daunt 	 ing 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	people	say	,	``	 blood 	 y 	 	hell	mate	,	i	have	n't	got	time	to	get	fit	.	you	want	me	to	go	to	church	and	call	my	mother	.	``	and	i	understand	.
i	 tru 	 ly 	 	understand	how	that	can	be	 daunt 	 ing 	 	.
but	an	incident	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	 g 	 ave 	 	me	a	new	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	.
my	wife	,	who	is	 some 	 where 	 	in	the	audience	 to 	 day 	 	,	 call 	 ed 	 	me	up	at	the	 off 	 ice 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	nigel	,	you	need	to	pick	our	 young 	 est 	 	son	``	--	harry	--	``	up	from	school	.	``	 be 	 cause 	 	she	had	to	be	 some 	 where 	 	else	with	the	other	three	children	for	that	 even 	 ing 	 	.
so	i	left	work	an	hour	early	that	afternoon	and	 pick 	 ed 	 	harry	up	at	the	school	 gate 	 s 	 	.
we	 walk 	 ed 	 	down	to	the	local	park	,	 mess 	 ed 	 	around	on	the	 s 	 wing 	 s 	 	,	 play 	 ed 	 	some	 s 	 il 	 ly 	 	 game 	 s 	 	.
i	then	 walk 	 ed 	 	him	up	the	hill	to	the	local	cafe	,	and	we	 share 	 d 	 	a	pizza	for	two	,	then	 walk 	 ed 	 	down	the	hill	to	our	home	,	and	i	 g 	 ave 	 	him	his	bath	and	put	him	in	his	batman	 pajama 	 s 	 	.
i	then	read	him	a	chapter	of	roald	dahl	's	``	james	and	the	giant	peach	.	``
i	then	put	him	to	bed	,	 tuck 	 ed 	 	him	in	,	 g 	 ave 	 	him	a	kiss	on	his	 fore 	 head 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 good 	 night 	 	,	mate	,	``	and	 walk 	 ed 	 	out	of	his	 bed 	 room 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	was	 walk 	 ing 	 	out	of	his	 bed 	 room 	 	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	dad	?	``	i	went	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	mate	?	``	he	went	,	``	dad	,	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	the	best	day	of	my	life	,	ever	.	``	i	had	n't	 d 	 one 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	,	had	n't	taken	him	to	disney	world	or	 b 	 ought 	 	him	a	playstation	.
now	my	point	is	the	small	 thing 	 s 	 	matter	.
 be 	 ing 	 	more	 balanc 	 ed 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	 dramat 	 ic 	 	 up 	 heav 	 al 	 	in	your	life	.
with	the	 small 	 est 	 	 invest 	 ment 	 	in	the	right	 place 	 s 	 	,	you	can	 radical 	 ly 	 	transform	the	quality	of	your	 relationship 	 s 	 	and	the	quality	of	your	life	.
 more 	 over 	 	,	i	think	,	it	can	transform	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	if	 en 	 ough 	 	people	do	it	,	we	can	change	 socie 	 ty 	 	's	definition	of	success	away	from	the	 moron 	 ically 	 	 simpl 	 istic 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	that	the	person	with	the	most	money	when	he	dies	 win 	 s 	 	,	to	a	more	 thought 	 ful 	 	and	 balanc 	 ed 	 	definition	of	what	a	life	well	lived	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
and	that	,	i	think	,	is	an	idea	worth	 spread 	 ing 	 	.
