 th 	 is 	 	is	my	first	trip	,
my	first	foreign	trip	 a 	 s 	 	a	first	 lad 	 y 	 	.
can	you	 believ 	 e 	 	that	?
and	while	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	my	first	visit	to	the	u.k.	,	i	have	to	say	that	i	am	glad	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	first	official	visit	.
the	special	relationship	between	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	and	the	u.k.	is	based	not	 on 	 ly 	 	on	the	relationship	between	 government 	 s 	 	,	but	the	common	language	and	the	 value 	 s 	 	that	we	share	,
and	i	'm	 re 	 minded 	 	of	that	by	 watch 	 ing 	 	you	all	 to 	 day 	 	.
 dur 	 ing 	 	my	visit	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 honor 	 ed 	 	to	meet	some	of	britain	's	most	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	women	--
women	who	are	 pav 	 ing 	 	the	way	for	all	of	you	.
and	i	'm	 honor 	 ed 	 	to	meet	you	,	the	future	 lead 	 ers 	 	of	great	britain	and	 th 	 is 	 	world	.
and	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	the	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	of	our	 live 	 s 	 	may	seem	 ver 	 y 	 	 di 	 stant 	 	,	with	me	 stand 	 ing 	 	here	 a 	 s 	 	the	first	 lad 	 y 	 	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	of	america	,	and	you	,	just	 get 	 ting 	 	through	school	,	i	want	you	to	know	that	we	have	 ver 	 y 	 	much	in	common	.
for	 noth 	 ing 	 	in	my	life	's	path	would	have	 predict 	 ed 	 	that	i	'd	be	 stand 	 ing 	 	here	 a 	 s 	 	the	first	african	-	american	first	 lad 	 y 	 	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	of	america	.
there	is	 noth 	 ing 	 	in	my	story	that	would	land	me	here	.
i	was	n't	raised	with	wealth	or	 resource 	 s 	 	or	any	social	 stand 	 ing 	 	to	speak	of	.
i	was	raised	on	the	south	side	of	chicago	.
that	's	the	real	part	of	chicago	.
and	i	was	the	product	of	a	 work 	 ing 	 	-	class	community	.
my	father	was	a	city	 work 	 er 	 	all	of	his	life	,
and	my	mother	was	a	stay	-	at	-	home	mom	.
and	she	 stay 	 ed 	 	at	home	to	take	care	of	me	and	my	 old 	 er 	 	brother	.
 n 	 either 	 	of	them	 attend 	 ed 	 	university	.
my	dad	was	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	with	 multi 	 ple 	 	sclerosis	in	the	prime	of	his	life	.
but	even	 a 	 s 	 	it	got	 hard 	 er 	 	for	him	to	walk	and	get	 dress 	 ed 	 	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	--	i	saw	him	struggle	more	and	more	--	my	father	never	 complain 	 ed 	 	about	his	struggle	.
he	was	 grat 	 e 	 ful 	 	for	what	he	had	.
he	just	 wok 	 e 	 	up	a	little	 ear 	 lier 	 	and	 work 	 ed 	 	a	little	 hard 	 er 	 	.
and	my	brother	and	i	 we 	 re 	 	raised	with	all	that	you	 re 	 ally 	 	need	:	love	,	strong	 value 	 s 	 	and	a	belief	that	with	a	good	education	and	a	whole	lot	of	hard	work	,	that	there	was	 noth 	 ing 	 	that	we	could	not	do	.
i	am	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	what	's	possible	when	 girl 	 s 	 	from	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	are	 love 	 d 	 	and	 nurture 	 d 	 	by	the	people	around	them	.
i	was	 surround 	 ed 	 	by	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	women	in	my	life	:
 grand 	 mother 	 s 	 	,	 teacher 	 s 	 	,	 aunt 	 s 	 	,	 cousin 	 s 	 	,	 neighbor 	 s 	 	,	who	taught	me	about	quiet	strength	and	dignity	.
and	my	mother	,	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	role	model	in	my	life	,	who	 live 	 s 	 	with	us	at	the	white	house	and	 help 	 s 	 	to	care	for	our	two	little	 daughter 	 s 	 	,	malia	and	sasha	.
she	's	an	active	presence	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	mine	,	and	is	 instill 	 ing 	 	in	them	the	same	 value 	 s 	 	that	she	taught	me	and	my	brother	:	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	and	 integ 	 r 	 ity 	 	,	and	confidence	,	and	 persever 	 ance 	 	--
all	of	that	 wrap 	 ped 	 	up	in	an	 un 	 condition 	 al 	 	love	that	 on 	 ly 	 	a	 grand 	 mother 	 	can	give	.
i	was	 al 	 so 	 	fortunate	 en 	 ough 	 	to	be	 cher 	 ish 	 ed 	 	and	 encourag 	 ed 	 	by	some	strong	male	role	 model 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	my	father	,	my	brother	,	 uncle 	 s 	 	and	 grand 	 father 	 s 	 	.
the	men	in	my	life	taught	me	some	 import 	 ant 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
they	taught	me	about	what	a	 respect 	 ful 	 	relationship	should	look	like	between	men	and	women	.
they	taught	me	about	what	a	strong	marriage	 feel 	 s 	 	like	:
that	it	's	built	on	faith	and	 commit 	 ment 	 	and	an	 admi 	 ration 	 	for	each	other	's	 un 	 ique 	 	 gift 	 s 	 	.
they	taught	me	about	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	to	be	a	father	and	to	raise	a	family	.
and	not	 on 	 ly 	 	to	invest	in	your	own	home	but	to	reach	out	and	help	raise	 kid 	 s 	 	in	the	 broad 	 er 	 	community	.
and	these	 we 	 re 	 	the	same	 qual 	 ities 	 	that	i	 look 	 ed 	 	for	in	my	own	husband	,	barack	obama	.
and	when	we	first	met	,	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	remember	is	that	he	took	me	out	on	a	date	.
and	his	date	was	to	go	with	him	to	a	community	 meet 	 ing 	 	.
i	know	,	how	romantic	.
but	when	we	met	,	barack	was	a	community	 organize 	 r 	 	.
he	 work 	 ed 	 	,	 help 	 ing 	 	people	to	find	 job 	 s 	 	and	to	try	to	 br 	 ing 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	 neighbor 	 hood 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	he	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	the	 resident 	 s 	 	in	that	community	center	,	he	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	two	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	.
he	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	``	the	world	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	``	and	``	the	world	 a 	 s 	 	it	should	be	.	``
and	i	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	entire	campaign	.
what	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	that	all	too	often	,	is	that	we	accept	the	distance	between	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 idea 	 s 	 	.
and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	we	settle	for	the	world	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	,	even	when	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	reflect	our	 value 	 s 	 	and	 aspir 	 ations 	 	.
but	barack	 re 	 minded 	 	us	on	that	day	,	all	of	us	in	that	room	,	that	we	all	know	what	our	world	should	look	like	.
we	know	what	 fair 	 ness 	 	and	justice	and	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	look	like	.
we	all	know	.
and	he	 urge 	 d 	 	the	people	in	that	 meet 	 ing 	 	,	in	that	community	,	to	devote	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	 clo 	 s 	 ing 	 	the	gap	between	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 idea 	 s 	 	,	to	work	together	to	try	to	make	the	world	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	and	the	world	 a 	 s 	 	it	should	be	,	one	and	the	same	.
and	i	think	about	that	 to 	 day 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	am	 re 	 minded 	 	and	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	that	all	of	you	in	 th 	 is 	 	school	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 part 	 s 	 	of	 clo 	 s 	 ing 	 	that	gap	.
you	are	the	women	who	will	build	the	world	 a 	 s 	 	it	should	be	.
you	're	going	to	write	the	next	chapter	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
not	just	for	 your 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	but	for	your	generation	and	 generation 	 s 	 	to	come	.
and	that	's	why	 get 	 ting 	 	a	good	education	is	so	 import 	 ant 	 	.
that	's	why	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	that	you	're	going	through	--	the	 up 	 s 	 	and	the	 down 	 s 	 	,	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	that	you	love	and	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	that	you	do	n't	--	why	it	's	so	 import 	 ant 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	and	 count 	 ries 	 	and	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	the	world	are	 on 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	strong	 a 	 s 	 	the	health	of	 the 	 ir 	 	women	.
and	that	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	keep	in	mind	.
part	of	that	health	 include 	 s 	 	an	 out 	 stand 	 ing 	 	education	.
the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	a	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	family	and	a	 health 	 y 	 	one	is	often	the	presence	of	an	 empower 	 ed 	 	woman	or	women	at	the	center	of	that	family	.
the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	a	broken	community	and	a	 thriv 	 ing 	 	one	is	often	the	 health 	 y 	 	respect	between	men	and	women	who	appreciate	the	 con 	 trib 	 ution 	 s 	 	each	other	 make 	 s 	 	to	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	a	 languish 	 ing 	 	nation	and	one	that	will	flourish	is	the	 re 	 cognition 	 	that	we	need	equal	access	to	education	for	both	 boy 	 s 	 	and	 girl 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	school	,	named	after	the	u.k.	's	first	female	doctor	,	and	the	 surround 	 ing 	 	 building 	 s 	 	named	for	mexican	artist	frida	kahlo	,	mary	seacole	,	the	jamaican	nurse	known	 a 	 s 	 	the	``	black	florence	nightingale	,	``	and	the	english	author	,	emily	bronte	,	honor	women	who	 f 	 ought 	 	 s 	 ex 	 ism 	 	,	 rac 	 ism 	 	and	 ignor 	 ance 	 	,	to	pursue	 the 	 ir 	 	 pass 	 ions 	 	to	feed	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 soul 	 s 	 	.
they	 allow 	 ed 	 	for	no	 obstacle 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	the	sign	 s 	 aid 	 	back	there	,	``	 with 	 out 	 	 limit 	 ations 	 	.	``
they	 k 	 new 	 	no	other	way	to	live	than	to	follow	 the 	 ir 	 	 dream 	 s 	 	.
and	 hav 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	so	,	these	women	 move 	 d 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 obstacle 	 s 	 	.
and	they	 open 	 ed 	 	 man 	 y 	 	new	 door 	 s 	 	for	 million 	 s 	 	of	female	 doctor 	 s 	 	and	 nurse 	 s 	 	and	 artist 	 s 	 	and	 author 	 s 	 	,	all	of	whom	have	 follow 	 ed 	 	them	.
and	by	 get 	 ting 	 	a	good	education	,	you	too	can	control	your	own	 de 	 s 	 tin 	 y 	 	.
 pleas 	 e 	 	remember	that	.
if	you	want	to	know	the	reason	why	i	'm	 stand 	 ing 	 	here	,	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	of	education	.
i	never	cut	class	.	sorry	,	i	do	n't	know	if	 any 	 body 	 	is	cutting	class	.
i	never	did	it	.
i	 love 	 d 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 a 	 s 	 	.
i	 like 	 d 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	smart	.
i	 like 	 d 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	on	time	.	i	 like 	 d 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	my	work	 d 	 one 	 	.
i	thought	 be 	 ing 	 	smart	was	 cool 	 er 	 	than	 any 	 thing 	 	in	the	world	.
and	you	too	,	with	these	same	 value 	 s 	 	,	can	control	your	own	 de 	 s 	 tin 	 y 	 	.
you	too	can	pave	the	way	.
you	too	can	 real 	 ize 	 	your	 dream 	 s 	 	,	and	then	your	job	is	to	reach	back	and	to	help	 some 	 one 	 	just	like	you	do	the	same	thing	.
 histo 	 ry 	 	 prove 	 s 	 	that	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	 whet 	 her 	 	you	come	from	a	council	 e 	 state 	 	or	a	country	 e 	 state 	 	.
your	success	will	be	 determine 	 d 	 	by	your	own	 fort 	 itude 	 	,	your	own	confidence	,	your	own	individual	hard	work	.
that	is	true	.	that	is	the	 re 	 ality 	 	of	the	world	that	we	live	in	.
you	now	have	control	over	your	own	 de 	 s 	 tin 	 y 	 	.
and	it	wo	n't	be	easy	--	that	's	for	 s 	 ure 	 	.
but	you	have	 every 	 thing 	 	you	need	.
