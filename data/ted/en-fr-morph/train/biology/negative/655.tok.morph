in	oxford	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	we	can	use	lewis	carroll	and	look	in	the	looking	glass	that	is	new	york	city	to	try	and	see	our	true	 s 	 elves 	 	,	or	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	pass	through	to	 an 	 other 	 	world	.
or	,	in	the	 word 	 s 	 	of	f.	scott	fitzgerald	,	``	 a 	 s 	 	the	moon	rose	 high 	 er 	 	,	the	inessential	 house 	 s 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	to	melt	away	 un 	 til 	 	 gradu 	 ally 	 	i	 be 	 came 	 	aware	of	the	old	 is 	 land 	 	here	that	once	flowered	for	dutch	 sail 	 ors 	 	'	 eye 	 s 	 	,	a	fresh	green	breast	of	the	new	world	.	``
my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	and	i	have	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	for	10	 year 	 s 	 	to	 re 	 discover 	 	 th 	 is 	 	lost	world	in	a	project	we	call	the	mannahatta	project	.
we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	discover	what	henry	hudson	would	have	 s 	 een 	 	on	the	afternoon	of	september	12th	,	1609	,	when	he	 s 	 ailed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	new	york	harbor	.
and	i	'd	like	to	tell	you	the	story	in	three	 act 	 s 	 	,
and	if	i	have	time	still	,	an	epilogue	.
so	,	act	i	:	a	map	found	.
so	,	i	did	n't	grow	up	in	new	york	.
i	grew	up	out	west	in	the	sierra	nevada	 mountain 	 s 	 	,	like	you	see	here	,	in	the	red	rock	canyon	.
and	from	these	early	 experience 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	child	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	to	love	 land 	 scapes 	 	.
and	so	when	it	 be 	 came 	 	time	for	me	to	do	my	graduate	 stud 	 ies 	 	,	i	 stud 	 ied 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	field	of	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	 eco 	 logy 	 	.
 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	 eco 	 logy 	 	 concern 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	with	how	the	stream	and	the	meadow	and	the	forest	and	the	 cliff 	 s 	 	make	 habit 	 at 	 s 	 	for	 plant 	 s 	 	and	 animal 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	experience	and	 th 	 is 	 	training	lead	me	to	get	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	job	with	the	 wild 	 life 	 	 conserv 	 ation 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	which	 work 	 s 	 	to	 s 	 ave 	 	 wild 	 life 	 	and	wild	 place 	 s 	 	all	over	the	world	.
and	over	the	last	decade	,	i	 travel 	 ed 	 	to	over	40	 count 	 ries 	 	to	see	jaguars	and	 bear 	 s 	 	and	 elephant 	 s 	 	and	 tiger 	 s 	 	and	 rhino 	 s 	 	.
but	every	time	i	would	return	from	my	 trip 	 s 	 	i	'd	return	back	to	new	york	city	.
and	on	my	 week 	 end 	 s 	 	i	would	go	up	,	just	like	all	the	other	 tourist 	 s 	 	,	to	the	top	of	the	empire	state	building	,	and	i	'd	look	down	on	 th 	 is 	 	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	,	on	these	 eco 	 system 	 s 	 	,	and	i	'd	wonder	,	``	how	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	work	to	make	 habit 	 at 	 	for	 plant 	 s 	 	and	 animal 	 s 	 	?
how	 do 	 es 	 	it	work	to	make	 habit 	 at 	 	for	 animal 	 s 	 	like	me	?	``
i	'd	go	to	 time 	 s 	 	square	and	i	'd	look	at	the	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 lad 	 ies 	 	on	the	wall	,	and	wonder	why	 no 	 body 	 	is	looking	at	the	 historic 	 al 	 	 figure 	 s 	 	just	 be 	 hind 	 	them	.
i	'd	go	to	central	park	and	see	the	 roll 	 ing 	 	 top 	 ography 	 	of	central	park	come	up	against	the	abrupt	and	 she 	 er 	 	 top 	 ography 	 	of	 mid 	 town 	 	manhattan	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	 read 	 ing 	 	about	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	and	the	 geo 	 graphy 	 	in	new	york	city	.
i	read	that	new	york	city	was	the	first	mega	-	city	,	a	city	of	10	million	people	or	more	,	in	1950	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	are	from	new	york	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	125th	street	under	the	west	side	 high 	 way 	 	.
it	was	once	a	beach	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	john	james	audubon	,	the	 paint 	 er 	 	,	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	on	the	rock	.
and	it	's	looking	up	on	the	wooded	 height 	 s 	 	of	washington	 height 	 s 	 	to	jeffrey	's	hook	,	where	the	george	washington	bridge	 go 	 es 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
or	 th 	 is 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 	,	from	the	1740s	,	from	greenwich	village	.
 t 	 hose 	 	are	two	 student 	 s 	 	at	king	's	college	--	 lat 	 er 	 	columbia	university	--	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	on	a	hill	,	 overlook 	 ing 	 	a	 val 	 ley 	 	.
and	so	i	'd	go	down	to	greenwich	village	and	i	'd	look	for	 th 	 is 	 	hill	,	and	i	could	n't	find	it	.	and	i	could	n't	find	that	palm	tree	.
what	's	that	palm	tree	 do 	 ing 	 	there	?
so	,	it	was	in	the	course	of	these	 investigation 	 s 	 	that	i	ran	 in 	 to 	 	a	map	.
and	it	's	 th 	 is 	 	map	you	see	here	.
it	's	held	in	a	 geo 	 graphic 	 	information	system	which	 allow 	 s 	 	me	to	zoom	in	.
 th 	 is 	 	map	is	n't	from	hudson	's	time	,	but	from	the	american	revolution	,	170	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	made	by	british	 militar 	 y 	 	cartographers	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	occupation	of	new	york	city	.
and	it	's	a	 remark 	 able 	 	map	.	it	's	in	the	national	 archiv 	 es 	 	here	in	kew	.
and	it	's	10	feet	long	and	three	and	a	half	feet	wide	.
and	if	i	zoom	in	to	lower	manhattan	you	can	see	the	 ex 	 tent 	 	of	new	york	city	 a 	 s 	 	it	was	,	right	at	the	end	of	the	american	revolution	.
here	's	 bowl 	 ing 	 	green	.	and	here	's	broadway	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	city	hall	park	.	so	the	city	 bas 	 ically 	 	 extend 	 ed 	 	to	city	hall	park	.	and	just	beyond	it	you	can	see	 feature 	 s 	 	that	have	 vanish 	 ed 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	that	have	 disappear 	 ed 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	collect	pond	,	which	was	the	fresh	water	source	for	new	york	city	for	 it 	 s 	 	first	200	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	for	the	native	americans	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	before	that	.
you	can	see	the	lispenard	 meadow 	 s 	 	 drain 	 ing 	 	down	through	here	,	through	what	is	tribeca	now	,	and	the	 beach 	 es 	 	that	come	up	from	the	 batt 	 ery 	 	,	all	the	way	to	42nd	st	.
 th 	 is 	 	map	was	made	for	 militar 	 y 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	.
they	're	mapping	the	 road 	 s 	 	,	the	 building 	 s 	 	,	these	 fort 	 ification 	 s 	 	that	they	built	.
but	they	're	 al 	 so 	 	mapping	 thing 	 s 	 	of	 eco 	 logical 	 	interest	,	 al 	 so 	 	 militar 	 y 	 	interest	:	the	 hill 	 s 	 	,	the	 marsh 	 es 	 	,	the	 stream 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	richmond	hill	,	and	minetta	water	,	which	used	to	run	 it 	 s 	 	way	through	greenwich	village	.
or	the	swamp	at	gramercy	park	,	right	here	.
or	murray	hill	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	murrays	'	house	on	murray	hill	,	200	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
here	is	 time 	 s 	 	square	,	the	two	 stream 	 s 	 	that	came	together	to	make	a	wetland	in	 time 	 s 	 	square	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	was	at	the	end	of	the	american	revolution	.
so	i	saw	 th 	 is 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	map	in	a	book	.
and	i	thought	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	``	you	know	,	if	i	could	georeference	 th 	 is 	 	map	,	if	i	could	place	 th 	 is 	 	map	in	the	grid	of	the	city	 to 	 day 	 	,	i	could	find	these	lost	 feature 	 s 	 	of	the	city	,	in	the	block	-	by	-	block	 geo 	 graphy 	 	that	people	know	,	the	 geo 	 graphy 	 	of	where	people	go	to	work	,	and	where	they	go	to	live	,	and	where	they	like	to	eat	.	``
so	,	after	some	work	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	georeference	it	,	which	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	put	the	modern	 street 	 s 	 	on	the	city	,	and	the	 building 	 s 	 	,	and	the	open	 space 	 s 	 	,
so	that	we	can	zoom	in	to	where	the	collect	pond	is	.
we	can	 digit 	 ize 	 	the	collect	pond	and	the	 stream 	 s 	 	,	and	see	where	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	are	in	the	 geo 	 graphy 	 	of	the	city	 to 	 day 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 f 	 un 	 	for	 find 	 ing 	 	where	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 relat 	 ive 	 	to	the	old	 top 	 ography 	 	.
but	i	had	 an 	 other 	 	idea	about	 th 	 is 	 	map	.
if	we	take	away	the	 street 	 s 	 	,	and	if	we	take	away	the	 building 	 s 	 	,	and	if	we	take	away	the	open	 space 	 s 	 	,	then	we	could	take	 th 	 is 	 	map	.
if	we	pull	off	the	18th	century	 feature 	 s 	 	we	could	drive	it	back	in	time	.
we	could	drive	it	back	to	 it 	 s 	 	 eco 	 logical 	 	 fundamental 	 s 	 	:	to	the	 hill 	 s 	 	,	to	the	 stream 	 s 	 	,	to	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	 hydro 	 logy 	 	and	 shore 	 line 	 	,	to	the	 beach 	 es 	 	,	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	that	make	the	 eco 	 logical 	 	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	.
then	,	if	we	 add 	 ed 	 	 map 	 s 	 	like	the	 geo 	 logy 	 	,	the	 bed 	 rock 	 	 geo 	 logy 	 	,	and	the	surface	 geo 	 logy 	 	,	what	the	 glaci 	 ers 	 	 leav 	 e 	 	,	if	we	make	the	 s 	 oil 	 	map	,	with	the	17	 s 	 oil 	 	 class 	 es 	 	,	that	are	defined	by	the	national	 conserv 	 ation 	 	service	,	if	we	make	a	digital	 elev 	 ation 	 	model	of	the	 top 	 ography 	 	that	 tell 	 s 	 	us	how	high	the	 hill 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	,	then	we	can	 calcul 	 ate 	 	the	 slop 	 es 	 	.
we	can	 calcul 	 ate 	 	the	 a 	 spect 	 	.
we	can	 calcul 	 ate 	 	the	winter	wind	 expo 	 s 	 ure 	 	--	so	,	which	way	the	winter	 wind 	 s 	 	blow	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	.
the	white	 area 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	map	are	the	 place 	 s 	 	 protect 	 ed 	 	from	the	winter	 wind 	 s 	 	.
we	 compil 	 ed 	 	all	the	information	about	where	the	native	americans	 we 	 re 	 	,	the	lenape	.	and	we	built	a	 prob 	 ability 	 	map	about	where	they	might	have	 be 	 en 	 	.
so	,	the	red	 area 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	map	 indic 	 ate 	 	the	 place 	 s 	 	that	are	best	for	human	 sustain 	 ability 	 	on	manhattan	,	 place 	 s 	 	that	are	close	to	water	,	 place 	 s 	 	that	are	near	the	harbor	to	fish	,	 place 	 s 	 	 protect 	 ed 	 	from	the	winter	 wind 	 s 	 	.
we	know	that	there	was	a	lenape	 settle 	 ment 	 	down	here	by	the	collect	pond	.
and	we	 k 	 new 	 	that	they	 plant 	 ed 	 	a	kind	of	 horti 	 culture 	 	,	that	they	grew	these	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 garden 	 s 	 	of	corn	,	 bean 	 s 	 	,	and	squash	,	the	``	three	 sister 	 s 	 	``	garden	.
so	,	we	built	a	model	that	 explain 	 s 	 	where	 t 	 hose 	 	 field 	 s 	 	might	have	 be 	 en 	 	.
and	the	old	 field 	 s 	 	,	the	 success 	 ional 	 	 field 	 s 	 	that	go	.
and	we	might	think	of	these	 a 	 s 	 	 abandon 	 ed 	 	.
but	,	in	fact	,	they	're	 grass 	 land 	 	 habit 	 at 	 s 	 	for	 grass 	 land 	 	 bird 	 s 	 	and	 plant 	 s 	 	.
and	they	have	 be 	 come 	 	 success 	 ional 	 	shrub	 land 	 s 	 	,	and	these	then	mix	in	to	a	map	of	all	the	 eco 	 logical 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	.
and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	manhattan	had	55	different	 eco 	 system 	 	 type 	 s 	 	.
you	can	think	of	these	 a 	 s 	 	 neighbor 	 hood 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 distinct 	 ive 	 	 a 	 s 	 	tribeca	and	the	upper	east	side	and	inwood	--	that	these	are	the	forest	and	the	 wet 	 land 	 s 	 	and	the	marine	 commun 	 ities 	 	,	the	 beach 	 es 	 	.
and	55	is	a	lot	.	on	a	per	-	area	 bas 	 is 	 	,	manhattan	had	more	 eco 	 logical 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	per	acre	than	yosemite	 do 	 es 	 	,	than	yellowstone	,	than	amboseli	.
it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	that	was	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 support 	 ing 	 	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 bio 	 divers 	 ity 	 	.
so	,	act	ii	:	a	home	 re 	 construct 	 ed 	 	.
so	,	we	 stud 	 ied 	 	the	fish	and	the	 frog 	 s 	 	and	the	 bird 	 s 	 	and	the	bees	,	the	85	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	fish	that	 we 	 re 	 	on	manhattan	,	the	heath	hens	,	the	species	that	are	n't	there	 any 	 more 	 	,	the	beavers	on	all	the	 stream 	 s 	 	,	the	black	 bear 	 s 	 	,	and	the	native	americans	,	to	 stud 	 y 	 	how	they	used	and	thought	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	.
we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	try	and	map	these	.	and	to	do	that	what	we	did	was	we	 ma 	 pped 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 habit 	 at 	 	 need 	 s 	 	.
where	do	they	get	 the 	 ir 	 	food	?
where	do	they	get	 the 	 ir 	 	water	?	where	do	they	get	 the 	 ir 	 	shelter	?
where	do	they	get	 the 	 ir 	 	 re 	 productive 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	?
to	an	ecologist	,	the	 intersect 	 ion 	 	of	these	is	 habit 	 at 	 	,
but	to	most	people	,	the	 intersect 	 ion 	 	of	these	is	 the 	 ir 	 	home	.
so	,	we	would	read	in	field	 guide 	 s 	 	,	the	standard	field	 guide 	 s 	 	that	 may 	 be 	 	you	have	on	your	 shelv 	 es 	 	,	you	know	,	what	beavers	need	is	``	a	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	meandering	stream	with	aspen	 tree 	 s 	 	and	alders	and	willows	,	near	the	water	.	``	that	's	the	best	thing	for	a	 be 	 a 	 ver 	 	.
so	we	just	 start 	 ed 	 	making	a	list	.
here	is	the	 be 	 a 	 ver 	 	.	and	here	is	the	stream	,	and	the	aspen	and	the	 al 	 der 	 	and	the	 will 	 ow 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	if	these	 we 	 re 	 	the	 map 	 s 	 	that	we	would	need	to	predict	where	you	would	find	the	 be 	 a 	 ver 	 	.
or	the	bog	turtle	,	 need 	 ing 	 	wet	 meadow 	 s 	 	and	 insect 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 un 	 ny 	 	 place 	 s 	 	.
or	the	bobcat	,	 need 	 ing 	 	 rabbi 	 ts 	 	and	beavers	and	den	 s 	 ites 	 	.
and	 rapid 	 ly 	 	we	 start 	 ed 	 	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	beavers	can	be	 some 	 thing 	 	that	a	bobcat	 need 	 s 	 	.
but	a	 be 	 a 	 ver 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 need 	 s 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.	and	that	 hav 	 ing 	 	it	on	either	side	 mean 	 s 	 	that	we	can	link	it	together	,	that	we	can	create	the	network	of	the	 habit 	 at 	 	 relationship 	 s 	 	for	these	species	.
 more 	 over 	 	,	we	 real 	 ized 	 	that	you	can	start	out	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 be 	 a 	 ver 	 	 special 	 ist 	 	,	but	you	can	look	up	what	an	aspen	 need 	 s 	 	.
an	aspen	 need 	 s 	 	fire	and	dry	 s 	 oil 	 s 	 	.
and	you	can	look	at	what	a	wet	meadow	 need 	 s 	 	.
and	it	need	beavers	to	create	the	 wet 	 land 	 s 	 	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	some	other	 thing 	 s 	 	.
but	you	can	 al 	 so 	 	talk	about	 s 	 un 	 ny 	 	 place 	 s 	 	.
so	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	a	 s 	 un 	 ny 	 	place	need	?	not	 habit 	 at 	 	per	 s 	 e 	 	.
but	what	are	the	 condition 	 s 	 	that	make	it	possible	?
or	fire	.	or	dry	 s 	 oil 	 s 	 	.
and	that	you	can	put	these	on	a	grid	that	's	1,000	 column 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 cross 	 	the	top	and	1,000	 row 	 s 	 	down	the	other	way	.
and	then	we	can	 visual 	 ize 	 	 th 	 is 	 	data	like	a	network	,	like	a	social	network	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	network	of	all	the	 habit 	 at 	 	 relationship 	 s 	 	of	all	the	 plant 	 s 	 	and	 animal 	 s 	 	on	manhattan	,	and	 every 	 thing 	 	they	 need 	 ed 	 	,	going	back	to	the	 geo 	 logy 	 	,	going	back	to	time	and	space	at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	core	of	the	web	.
we	call	 th 	 is 	 	the	muir	web	.	and	if	you	zoom	in	on	it	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.	each	point	is	a	different	species	or	a	different	stream	or	a	different	 s 	 oil 	 	type	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	little	gray	lines	are	the	 connect 	 ions 	 	that	connect	them	together	.
they	are	the	 connect 	 ions 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	make	nature	 resili 	 ent 	 	.
and	the	structure	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 make 	 s 	 	nature	work	,	 s 	 een 	 	with	all	 it 	 s 	 	 part 	 s 	 	.
we	call	these	muir	 web 	 s 	 	after	the	scottish	-	american	 natural 	 ist 	 	john	muir	,	who	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	when	we	try	to	pick	out	 any 	 thing 	 	by	 it 	 self 	 	,	we	find	that	it	's	bound	fast	by	a	thousand	 in 	 visible 	 	 cord 	 s 	 	that	can	not	be	broken	,	to	 every 	 thing 	 	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.	``
so	then	we	took	the	muir	 web 	 s 	 	and	we	took	them	back	to	the	 map 	 s 	 	.
so	if	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	go	between	85th	and	86th	,	and	lex	and	third	,	 may 	 be 	 	there	was	a	stream	in	that	block	.
and	these	would	be	the	kind	of	 tree 	 s 	 	that	might	have	 be 	 en 	 	there	,	and	the	 flower 	 s 	 	and	the	 lic 	 hens 	 	and	the	 moss 	 es 	 	,	the	 butter 	 flies 	 	,	the	fish	in	the	stream	,	the	 bird 	 s 	 	in	the	 tree 	 s 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	a	timber	 rattle 	 snake 	 	lived	there	.
and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	a	black	bear	 walk 	 ed 	 	by	.	and	 may 	 be 	 	native	americans	 we 	 re 	 	there	.
and	then	we	took	 th 	 is 	 	data	.
you	can	see	 th 	 is 	 	for	 your 	 self 	 	on	our	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
you	can	zoom	 in 	 to 	 	any	block	on	manhattan	,	and	see	what	might	have	 be 	 en 	 	there	400	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	we	used	it	to	try	and	reveal	a	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	here	in	act	iii	.
we	used	the	 tool 	 s 	 	they	use	in	hollywood	to	make	these	fantastic	 land 	 scapes 	 	that	we	all	see	in	the	 movie 	 s 	 	.
and	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	use	it	to	 visual 	 ize 	 	third	 a 	 venue 	 	.
so	we	would	take	the	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	and	we	would	build	up	the	 top 	 ography 	 	.
we	'd	lay	on	top	of	that	the	 s 	 oil 	 s 	 	and	the	 water 	 s 	 	,	and	illuminate	the	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	.
we	would	lay	on	top	of	that	the	map	of	the	 eco 	 logical 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	.
and	feed	 in 	 to 	 	that	the	map	of	the	species	.
so	that	we	would	 actual 	 ly 	 	take	a	photograph	,	 fly 	 ing 	 	above	 time 	 s 	 	square	,	looking	 to 	 ward 	 	the	hudson	river	,	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	hudson	to	come	.
using	 th 	 is 	 	technology	,	we	can	make	these	fantastic	georeferenced	 view 	 s 	 	.
we	can	 bas 	 ically 	 	take	a	picture	out	of	any	window	on	manhattan	and	see	what	that	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	like	400	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	view	from	the	east	river	,	looking	up	murray	hill	at	where	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	is	 to 	 day 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	view	looking	down	the	hudson	river	,	with	manhattan	on	the	left	,	and	new	jersey	out	on	the	right	,	looking	out	 to 	 ward 	 	the	atlantic	ocean	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	view	over	 time 	 s 	 	square	,	with	the	 be 	 a 	 ver 	 	pond	there	,	looking	out	 to 	 ward 	 	the	east	.
so	we	can	see	the	collect	pond	,	and	lispenard	 marsh 	 es 	 	back	 be 	 hind 	 	.
we	can	see	the	 field 	 s 	 	that	the	native	americans	made	.
and	we	can	see	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	 geo 	 graphy 	 	of	the	city	 to 	 day 	 	.
so	when	you	're	 watch 	 ing 	 	``	law	and	order	,	``	and	the	 lawyer 	 s 	 	walk	up	the	 step 	 s 	 	they	could	have	 walk 	 ed 	 	back	down	 t 	 hose 	 	 step 	 s 	 	of	the	new	york	court	house	,	right	 in 	 to 	 	the	collect	pond	,	400	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
so	these	 image 	 s 	 	are	the	work	of	my	friend	and	 col 	 league 	 	,	mark	boyer	,	who	is	here	in	the	audience	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	i	'd	just	like	,	if	you	would	give	him	a	hand	,	to	call	out	for	his	fine	work	.
there	is	 s 	 uch 	 	power	in	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	science	and	 visual 	 ization 	 	together	,	that	we	can	create	 image 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	looking	on	either	side	of	a	looking	glass	.
and	even	 th 	 ough 	 	i	've	 on 	 ly 	 	had	a	brief	time	to	speak	,	i	hope	you	appreciate	that	mannahatta	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	special	place	.
the	place	that	you	see	here	on	the	left	side	was	 interconnect 	 ed 	 	.	it	was	based	on	 th 	 is 	 	 divers 	 ity 	 	.
it	had	 th 	 is 	 	 resili 	 ence 	 	that	is	what	we	need	in	our	modern	world	.
but	i	would	n't	have	you	think	that	i	do	n't	like	the	place	on	the	right	,	which	i	 quit 	 e 	 	do	.	i	've	come	to	love	the	city	and	 it 	 s 	 	kind	of	 divers 	 ity 	 	,	and	 it 	 s 	 	 resili 	 ence 	 	,	and	 it 	 s 	 	 depend 	 ence 	 	on	density	and	how	we	're	 connect 	 ed 	 	together	.
in	fact	,	that	i	see	them	 a 	 s 	 	 reflect 	 ions 	 	of	each	other	,
much	 a 	 s 	 	lewis	carroll	did	in	``	through	the	looking	glass	.	``
we	can	 compar 	 e 	 	these	two	and	hold	them	in	our	 mind 	 s 	 	at	the	same	time	,	that	they	 re 	 ally 	 	are	the	same	place	,	that	there	is	no	way	that	cities	can	 es 	 cape 	 	from	nature	.
and	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	're	 learn 	 ing 	 	about	building	cities	in	the	future	.
so	if	you	'll	allow	me	a	brief	epilogue	,	not	about	the	past	,	but	about	400	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	,
what	we	're	 real 	 izing 	 	is	that	cities	are	 habit 	 at 	 s 	 	for	people	,	and	need	to	supply	what	people	need	:	a	sense	of	home	,	food	,	water	,	shelter	,	 re 	 productive 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	,	and	a	sense	of	meaning	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 part 	 icular 	 	 add 	 ition 	 al 	 	 habit 	 at 	 	 requir 	 ement 	 	of	 human 	 ity 	 	.
and	so	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 talk 	 s 	 	here	at	ted	are	about	meaning	,	about	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	meaning	to	our	 live 	 s 	 	in	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	different	ways	,	through	technology	,	through	art	,	through	science	,	so	much	so	that	i	think	we	focus	so	much	on	that	side	of	our	 live 	 s 	 	,	that	we	have	n't	 give 	 n 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	attention	to	the	food	and	the	water	and	the	shelter	,	and	what	we	need	to	raise	the	 kid 	 s 	 	.
so	,	how	can	we	envision	the	city	of	the	future	?
well	,	what	if	we	go	to	madison	square	park	,	and	we	imagine	it	 with 	 out 	 	all	the	 car 	 s 	 	,	and	 bi 	 cycle 	 s 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	and	large	 forest 	 s 	 	,	and	 stream 	 s 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 sew 	 ers 	 	and	storm	 drain 	 s 	 	?
what	if	we	 imagin 	 ed 	 	the	upper	east	side	with	green	 roof 	 s 	 	,	and	 stream 	 s 	 	 wind 	 ing 	 	through	the	city	,	and	 wind 	 mill 	 s 	 	 supply 	 ing 	 	the	power	we	need	?
or	if	we	imagine	the	new	york	city	 metro 	 politan 	 	area	,	 current 	 ly 	 	home	to	12	million	people	,	but	12	million	people	in	the	future	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	living	at	the	density	of	manhattan	,	in	 on 	 ly 	 	36	percent	of	the	area	,	with	the	 area 	 s 	 	in	between	 cover 	 ed 	 	by	 farm 	 land 	 	,	 cover 	 ed 	 	by	 wet 	 land 	 s 	 	,	 cover 	 ed 	 	by	the	 marsh 	 es 	 	we	need	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	kind	of	future	i	think	we	need	,	is	a	future	that	 ha 	 s 	 	the	same	 divers 	 ity 	 	and	abundance	and	 dynam 	 ism 	 	of	manhattan	,	but	that	 learn 	 s 	 	from	the	 sustain 	 ability 	 	of	the	past	,	of	the	 eco 	 logy 	 	,	the	original	 eco 	 logy 	 	,	of	nature	with	all	 it 	 s 	 	 part 	 s 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
