in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 invent 	 ion 	 	,	i	'd	like	to	tell	you	the	tale	of	one	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 project 	 s 	 	.
i	think	it	's	one	of	the	most	 excit 	 ing 	 	that	i	'm	 work 	 ing 	 	on	,	but	i	think	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	the	 simpl 	 est 	 	.
it	's	a	project	that	 ha 	 s 	 	the	potential	to	make	a	huge	impact	around	the	world	.
it	 address 	 es 	 	one	of	the	 big 	 gest 	 	health	 issue 	 s 	 	on	the	planet	,	the	number	one	cause	of	death	in	children	under	five	,	which	is	...	?	water	-	borne	 disease 	 s 	 	?	 dia 	 rrhea 	 	?	 mal 	 nutrition 	 	?
no	,	it	's	 breath 	 ing 	 	the	smoke	from	 in 	 door 	 	 cook 	 ing 	 	 fire 	 s 	 	--	 a 	 cute 	 	 respirator 	 y 	 	 infect 	 ions 	 	 caus 	 ed 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	.	can	you	 believ 	 e 	 	that	?
i	find	 th 	 is 	 	 shock 	 ing 	 	and	 some 	 what 	 	 app 	 all 	 ing 	 	.
ca	n't	we	make	 clean 	 er 	 	 burn 	 ing 	 	 cook 	 ing 	 	 fuel 	 s 	 	?
ca	n't	we	make	better	 stove 	 s 	 	?
how	is	it	that	 th 	 is 	 	can	lead	to	over	two	million	 death 	 s 	 	every	year	?
i	know	bill	joy	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	you	about	the	 wonder 	 s 	 	of	carbon	 nano 	 tube 	 s 	 	,
so	i	'm	going	to	talk	to	you	about	the	 wonder 	 s 	 	of	carbon	macro	-	 tube 	 s 	 	,	which	is	 char 	 coal 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	of	 r 	 ural 	 	 ha 	 iti 	 	.	 ha 	 iti 	 	is	now	98	percent	 de 	 forest 	 ed 	 	.	you	'll	see	 scene 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	all	over	the	 is 	 land 	 	.
it	 lead 	 s 	 	to	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 environment 	 al 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	and	 problem 	 s 	 	that	affect	people	 through 	 out 	 	the	nation	.
a	couple	 year 	 s 	 	ago	there	was	severe	 flood 	 ing 	 	that	led	to	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 death 	 s 	 	--	that	's	 direct 	 ly 	 	 attribut 	 able 	 	to	the	fact	that	there	are	no	 tree 	 s 	 	on	the	 hill 	 s 	 	to	 stabil 	 ize 	 	the	 s 	 oil 	 	.
so	the	 rain 	 s 	 	come	,	they	go	down	the	 river 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 flood 	 ing 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	.
now	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	why	there	are	so	few	 tree 	 s 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	people	need	to	cook	,	and	they	harvest	wood	and	they	make	 char 	 coal 	 	in	order	to	do	it	.
it	's	not	that	people	are	 ignor 	 ant 	 	to	the	 environment 	 al 	 	damage	.	they	know	 perfect 	 ly 	 	well	,	but	they	have	no	other	choice	.
fossil	 fuel 	 s 	 	are	not	 avail 	 able 	 	,	and	solar	energy	 do 	 es 	 	n't	cook	the	way	that	they	like	 the 	 ir 	 	food	prepared	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	they	do	.	you	'll	find	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	who	go	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	forest	to	find	a	tree	,	cut	it	down	and	make	 char 	 coal 	 	out	of	it	.
so	not	 surprising 	 ly 	 	,	there	's	a	lot	of	effort	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	to	look	at	 alter 	 native 	 	 cook 	 ing 	 	 fuel 	 s 	 	.
about	four	 year 	 s 	 	ago	i	took	a	team	of	 student 	 s 	 	down	to	 ha 	 iti 	 	,	and	we	 work 	 ed 	 	with	peace	 corp 	 s 	 	 volunteer 	 s 	 	there	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	 s 	 uch 	 	volunteer	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 de 	 vice 	 	that	he	had	built	in	the	village	where	he	 work 	 ed 	 	.
and	the	idea	was	that	you	could	take	waste	paper	;	you	could	compress	it	;	and	make	 briquette 	 s 	 	that	could	be	used	for	fuel	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 low 	 	.
so	our	 engineer 	 ing 	 	 student 	 s 	 	went	to	work	on	it	,	and	with	some	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 change 	 s 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	triple	the	 through 	 put 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	.
so	you	could	imagine	they	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	it	.
and	they	took	the	 briquette 	 s 	 	back	to	mit	so	that	they	could	test	them	.	and	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	they	found	was	they	did	n't	burn	.	so	it	was	a	little	 di 	 scour 	 aging 	 	to	the	 student 	 s 	 	.
and	in	fact	if	you	look	 close 	 ly 	 	,	right	here	,	you	can	see	it	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	u.s.	peace	 corp 	 s 	 	.	``
 a 	 s 	 	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	there	 actual 	 ly 	 	was	n't	any	waste	paper	in	 th 	 is 	 	village	.
and	while	it	was	a	good	use	of	government	 paper 	 work 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	volunteer	to	 br 	 ing 	 	it	back	with	him	to	his	village	,	it	was	800	 kilometer 	 s 	 	away	.
and	so	we	thought	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	there	might	be	a	better	way	to	come	up	with	an	 alter 	 native 	 	 cook 	 ing 	 	fuel	.
what	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	is	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	make	a	fuel	that	used	 some 	 thing 	 	that	was	 read 	 ily 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	on	the	local	level	.
you	see	these	all	over	 ha 	 iti 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.	they	're	small	-	scale	sugar	 mill 	 s 	 	.
and	the	waste	product	from	them	after	you	 ex 	 tract 	 	the	juice	from	the	 sugar 	 can 	 e 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 bag 	 ass 	 e 	 	.	``
it	 ha 	 s 	 	no	other	use	.	it	 ha 	 s 	 	no	 nutrition 	 al 	 	value	,	so	they	do	n't	feed	it	to	the	 animal 	 s 	 	.
it	just	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	in	a	pile	near	the	sugar	mill	 un 	 til 	 	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	they	burn	it	.
what	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	was	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	find	a	way	to	harness	 th 	 is 	 	waste	resource	and	turn	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	fuel	that	would	be	 some 	 thing 	 	that	people	could	 eas 	 ily 	 	cook	with	,	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 char 	 coal 	 	.
so	over	the	next	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	 student 	 s 	 	and	i	 work 	 ed 	 	to	develop	a	process	.
so	you	start	with	the	 bag 	 ass 	 e 	 	,	and	then	you	take	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	kiln	that	you	can	make	out	of	a	waste	fifty	five	-	gallon	oil	drum	.
after	some	time	,	after	setting	it	on	fire	,	you	seal	it	to	restrict	the	oxygen	that	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	kiln	,	and	then	you	end	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	 carbon 	 ized 	 	material	here	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	you	ca	n't	burn	 th 	 is 	 	.	it	's	too	fine	and	it	 burn 	 s 	 	too	 quick 	 ly 	 	to	be	 use 	 ful 	 	for	 cook 	 ing 	 	.
so	we	had	to	try	to	find	a	way	to	form	it	 in 	 to 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	 briquette 	 s 	 	.
and	 convenient 	 ly 	 	,	one	of	my	 student 	 s 	 	was	from	ghana	,	and	he	 remember 	 ed 	 	a	dish	his	mom	used	to	make	for	him	 call 	 ed 	 	``	kokonte	,	``	which	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 stick 	 y 	 	 por 	 ridge 	 	made	out	of	the	 cass 	 a 	 va 	 	root	.
and	so	what	we	did	was	we	 look 	 ed 	 	,	and	we	found	that	 cass 	 a 	 va 	 	is	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	grown	in	 ha 	 iti 	 	,	under	the	name	of	``	 mani 	 oc 	 	.	``	and	in	fact	,	it	's	grown	all	over	the	world	--	yucca	,	tapioca	,	 mani 	 oc 	 	,	 cass 	 a 	 va 	 	,	it	's	all	the	same	thing	--	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 starch 	 y 	 	root	 veget 	 able 	 	.
and	you	can	make	a	 ver 	 y 	 	thick	,	 stick 	 y 	 	 por 	 ridge 	 	out	of	it	,	which	you	can	use	to	bind	together	the	 char 	 coal 	 	 briquette 	 s 	 	.
so	we	did	 th 	 is 	 	.	we	went	down	to	 ha 	 iti 	 	.
these	are	the	 graduate 	 s 	 	of	the	first	ecole	de	chabon	,	or	 char 	 coal 	 	institute	.	and	these	--
--	that	's	right	.	so	i	'm	 actual 	 ly 	 	an	 instruct 	 or 	 	at	mit	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	cit	.
and	these	are	the	 briquette 	 s 	 	that	we	made	.
now	i	'm	going	to	take	you	to	a	different	continent	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	india	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	most	 common 	 ly 	 	used	 cook 	 ing 	 	fuel	in	india	;	it	's	cow	dung	.
and	more	than	in	 ha 	 iti 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 produce 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 smok 	 y 	 	 fire 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	you	see	the	health	 impact 	 s 	 	of	 cook 	 ing 	 	with	cow	dung	and	 bio 	 mass 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	fuel	.
 kid 	 s 	 	and	women	are	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 affect 	 ed 	 	by	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	the	 one 	 s 	 	who	are	around	the	 cook 	 ing 	 	 fire 	 s 	 	.
so	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	see	if	we	could	 introduc 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 char 	 coal 	 	-	making	technology	there	.
well	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	they	did	n't	have	 sugar 	 can 	 e 	 	and	they	did	n't	have	 cass 	 a 	 va 	 	,	but	that	did	n't	stop	us	.
what	we	did	was	we	found	what	 we 	 re 	 	the	 local 	 ly 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	 source 	 s 	 	of	 bio 	 mass 	 	.
and	there	was	wheat	straw	and	there	was	rice	straw	in	 th 	 is 	 	area	.
and	what	we	could	use	 a 	 s 	 	a	 bind 	 er 	 	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	small	 amount 	 s 	 	of	cow	 man 	 ure 	 	,	which	they	used	 ordinari 	 ly 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	fuel	.
and	we	did	side	-	by	-	side	 test 	 s 	 	,	and	here	you	can	see	the	 char 	 coal 	 	 briquette 	 s 	 	and	here	the	cow	dung	.	and	you	can	see	that	it	's	a	lot	 clean 	 er 	 	 burn 	 ing 	 	of	a	 cook 	 ing 	 	fuel	.
and	in	fact	,	it	 heat 	 s 	 	the	water	a	lot	more	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
and	so	we	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	,	thus	far	.
but	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	found	was	when	we	did	side	-	by	-	side	 compar 	 ison 	 s 	 	with	wood	 char 	 coal 	 	,	it	did	n't	burn	 a 	 s 	 	long	.	and	the	 briquette 	 s 	 	 crumb 	 led 	 	a	little	bit	,	and	we	lost	energy	 a 	 s 	 	they	fell	 a 	 part 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 cook 	 ing 	 	.
so	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	try	to	find	a	way	to	make	a	 strong 	 er 	 	briquette	so	that	we	could	compete	with	wood	 char 	 coal 	 	in	the	 market 	 s 	 	in	 ha 	 iti 	 	.
so	we	went	back	to	mit	,	we	took	out	the	instron	machine	,	and	we	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	what	sort	of	 force 	 s 	 	did	you	need	in	order	to	compress	a	briquette	to	the	level	and	at	the	same	time	that	we	had	 student 	 s 	 	in	the	lab	looking	at	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	 al 	 so 	 	had	community	 partner 	 s 	 	in	 ha 	 iti 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	to	develop	the	process	,	to	improve	it	and	to	make	it	more	 access 	 ible 	 	to	people	in	the	 village 	 s 	 	there	.
and	after	some	time	,	we	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	low	-	cost	press	that	 allow 	 s 	 	you	to	produce	 char 	 coal 	 	,	which	 actual 	 ly 	 	now	 burn 	 s 	 	 long 	 er 	 	,	 clean 	 er 	 	than	wood	 char 	 coal 	 	.
so	now	we	're	in	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	where	we	have	a	product	,	which	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	better	than	what	you	can	buy	in	 ha 	 iti 	 	in	the	 market 	 place 	 	,	which	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	place	to	be	.
in	 ha 	 iti 	 	 al 	 one 	 	,	about	30	million	 tree 	 s 	 	are	cut	down	every	year	.
there	's	a	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 implement 	 ed 	 	and	saving	a	good	 port 	 ion 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	.
in	 add 	 ition 	 	,	the	revenue	generated	from	that	 char 	 coal 	 	is	260	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	.	that	's	an	awful	lot	for	a	country	of	 ha 	 iti 	 	--	with	a	population	of	eight	million	and	an	average	income	of	less	than	400	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	we	're	 al 	 so 	 	moving	 a 	 head 	 	with	our	 char 	 coal 	 	project	.	and	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	think	is	 al 	 so 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	is	i	have	a	friend	up	at	uc	berkeley	who	's	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	risk	analysis	.
and	he	's	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	problem	of	the	health	 impact 	 s 	 	of	 burn 	 ing 	 	wood	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	 char 	 coal 	 	.	and	he	's	found	that	 world 	 wide 	 	,	you	could	prevent	a	million	 death 	 s 	 	 s 	 witch 	 ing 	 	from	wood	to	 char 	 coal 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 cook 	 ing 	 	fuel	.	that	's	 remark 	 able 	 	,
but	up	 un 	 til 	 	now	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	n't	ways	to	do	it	 with 	 out 	 	cutting	down	 tree 	 s 	 	.
but	now	we	have	a	way	that	's	using	an	 agricultur 	 al 	 	waste	material	to	create	a	 cook 	 ing 	 	fuel	.
one	of	the	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	came	out	of	the	trip	that	i	took	to	ghana	just	last	month	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	i	think	,	the	 cool 	 est 	 	thing	,
and	it	's	even	lower	tech	than	what	you	just	saw	,	so	what	is	 th 	 is 	 	?	 th 	 is 	 	is	 corn 	 cob 	 s 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 char 	 coal 	 	.
and	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	you	do	n't	need	to	form	 briquette 	 s 	 	--
it	 come 	 s 	 	ready	made	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	$	100	 lap 	 top 	 	,	right	here	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	like	nick	,	i	 br 	 ought 	 	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
so	we	can	pass	these	around	.
they	're	fully	functional	,	field	-	tested	,	ready	to	roll	out	.
and	i	think	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	,	which	is	 al 	 so 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	technology	,	is	that	the	technology	transfer	is	so	easy	.	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	the	 sugar 	 can 	 e 	 	 char 	 coal 	 	,	where	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	to	teach	people	how	to	form	it	 in 	 to 	 	 briquette 	 s 	 	and	you	have	the	extra	step	of	 cook 	 ing 	 	the	 bind 	 er 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 come 	 s 	 	pre	-	briquetted	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	about	the	most	 excit 	 ing 	 	thing	in	my	life	right	now	,	which	is	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	a	 s 	 ad 	 	 comment 	 ary 	 	on	my	life	.
but	once	you	see	it	,	like	you	 guy 	 s 	 	in	the	front	row	,	all	right	,
 yea 	 h 	 	,	ok	.	so	 any 	 way 	 	--
--	here	it	is	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	i	think	a	perfect	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	what	robert	wright	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	in	 t 	 hose 	 	non	-	zero	-	sum	 thing 	 s 	 	.
so	not	 on 	 ly 	 	do	you	have	health	 benefit 	 s 	 	,	you	have	 environment 	 al 	 	 benefit 	 s 	 	.	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	rare	 situ 	 ations 	 	where	you	 al 	 so 	 	have	economic	 benefit 	 s 	 	.
people	can	make	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 cook 	 ing 	 	fuel	from	waste	 product 	 s 	 	.	they	can	generate	income	from	 th 	 is 	 	.
they	can	 s 	 ave 	 	the	money	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	 s 	 pend 	 	on	 char 	 coal 	 	,	and	they	can	produce	excess	and	sell	it	in	the	market	to	people	who	are	n't	making	 the 	 ir 	 	own	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	rare	that	you	do	n't	have	trade	-	offs	between	health	and	 economic 	 s 	 	,	or	environment	and	 economic 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	project	that	i	just	find	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	,	and	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	looking	forward	to	see	where	it	 take 	 s 	 	us	.
so	when	we	talk	about	,	now	,	the	future	we	will	create	,	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	think	is	 necess 	 ary 	 	is	to	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	vision	of	the	world	that	we	live	in	.
and	now	i	do	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	mean	the	world	that	we	live	in	.	i	mean	the	world	where	women	 s 	 pend 	 	two	to	three	 hour 	 s 	 	 every 	 day 	 	 grind 	 ing 	 	grain	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	to	eat	.
i	mean	the	world	where	 advance 	 d 	 	building	 material 	 s 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	cement	 roof 	 ing 	 	 tile 	 s 	 	that	are	made	by	hand	,	and	where	,	when	you	work	10	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	,	you	're	still	 on 	 ly 	 	 earn 	 ing 	 	60	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	a	month	.
i	mean	the	world	where	women	and	children	 s 	 pend 	 	40	billion	 hour 	 s 	 	a	year	 fetch 	 ing 	 	water	.	that	's	 a 	 s 	 	if	the	entire	 work 	 force 	 	of	the	state	of	california	 work 	 ed 	 	full	time	for	a	year	 do 	 ing 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	but	 fetch 	 ing 	 	water	.
it	's	a	place	where	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	if	 th 	 is 	 	 we 	 re 	 	india	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	 on 	 ly 	 	three	of	us	would	have	a	car	.
if	 th 	 is 	 	 we 	 re 	 	afghanistan	,	 on 	 ly 	 	one	person	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	would	know	how	the	use	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
if	 th 	 is 	 	 we 	 re 	 	zambia	,	300	of	you	would	be	 farm 	 ers 	 	,	100	of	you	would	have	 aid 	 s 	 	or	hiv	.	and	more	than	half	of	you	would	be	living	on	less	than	a	dollar	a	day	.
these	are	the	 issue 	 s 	 	that	we	need	to	come	up	with	 solution 	 s 	 	for	.
these	are	the	 issue 	 s 	 	that	we	need	to	be	training	our	 engineer 	 s 	 	,	our	 design 	 ers 	 	,	our	business	people	,	our	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	to	be	facing	.
these	are	the	 solution 	 s 	 	that	we	need	to	find	.
i	have	a	few	 area 	 s 	 	that	i	 believ 	 e 	 	are	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	that	we	address	.	one	of	them	is	creating	 techno 	 logies 	 	to	promote	micro	-	finance	and	micro	-	enterprise	,	so	that	people	who	are	living	 be 	 low 	 	the	poverty	line	can	find	a	way	to	move	out	--	and	that	they	're	not	 do 	 ing 	 	it	using	the	same	 tradition 	 al 	 	basket	making	,	 po 	 ul 	 try 	 	 rear 	 ing 	 	,	etc	.
but	there	are	new	 techno 	 logies 	 	and	new	 product 	 s 	 	that	they	can	make	on	a	small	scale	.
the	next	thing	i	 believ 	 e 	 	is	that	we	need	to	create	 techno 	 logies 	 	for	poor	 farm 	 ers 	 	to	add	value	to	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 crop 	 s 	 	.
and	we	need	to	 re 	 think 	 	our	 develop 	 ment 	 	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	,	so	that	we	're	not	promoting	 education 	 al 	 	 campaign 	 s 	 	to	get	them	to	stop	 be 	 ing 	 	 farm 	 ers 	 	,	but	 ra 	 ther 	 	to	stop	 be 	 ing 	 	poor	 farm 	 ers 	 	.	and	we	need	to	think	about	how	we	can	do	that	 effective 	 ly 	 	.
we	need	to	work	with	the	people	in	these	 commun 	 ities 	 	,	and	give	them	the	 resource 	 s 	 	and	the	 tool 	 s 	 	that	they	need	to	solve	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 problem 	 s 	 	.	that	's	the	best	way	to	do	it	.	we	should	n't	be	 do 	 ing 	 	it	from	 out 	 side 	 	.
so	we	need	to	create	 th 	 is 	 	future	,	and	we	need	to	start	 do 	 ing 	 	it	now	.
thank	you	.
chris	anderson	:	tell	us	--	just	while	we	see	if	 some 	 one 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	question	--	just	tell	us	about	one	of	the	other	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	've	 work 	 ed 	 	on	.
amy	smith	:	a	couple	of	other	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	on	are	looking	at	ways	to	do	low	-	cost	water	quality	 test 	 ing 	 	,	so	that	 commun 	 ities 	 	can	maintain	 the 	 ir 	 	own	water	 system 	 s 	 	,	know	when	they	're	 work 	 ing 	 	,	know	when	they	treat	them	,	etc	.
we	're	 al 	 so 	 	looking	at	low	-	cost	water	 treat 	 ment 	 	 system 	 s 	 	.
one	of	the	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	is	looking	at	solar	water	 dis 	 infect 	 ion 	 	and	 improv 	 ing 	 	the	ability	to	be	able	to	do	that	.
ca	:	what	's	the	 bottle 	 neck 	 	to	 prevent 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	 get 	 ting 	 	from	scale	?
do	you	need	to	find	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	,	or	venture	 capital 	 ists 	 	,
or	what	do	you	need	to	take	what	you	've	got	and	get	it	to	scale	?
 a 	 s 	 	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	i	think	 it 	 s 	 	large	 number 	 s 	 	of	people	moving	it	forward	.
it	's	a	difficult	thing	;	it	's	a	 market 	 place 	 	which	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 fragment 	 ed 	 	and	a	consumer	population	with	no	income	.
so	you	ca	n't	use	the	same	 model 	 s 	 	that	you	use	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	for	making	 thing 	 s 	 	move	forward	.
and	we	're	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	small	staff	,	which	is	me	.
so	,	you	know	,	i	do	what	i	can	with	the	 student 	 s 	 	.	we	have	30	 student 	 s 	 	a	year	go	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	field	and	try	to	implement	 th 	 is 	 	and	move	it	forward	.
the	other	thing	is	you	have	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	with	a	long	time	frame	,	 a 	 s 	 	--	you	know	,	you	ca	n't	expect	to	get	 some 	 thing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	in	a	year	or	two	 year 	 s 	 	;	you	have	to	be	looking	five	or	10	 year 	 s 	 	 a 	 head 	 	.
but	i	think	with	the	vision	to	do	that	,	we	can	move	forward	.
