it	's	a	great	honor	to	be	here	with	you	.
the	good	news	is	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	aware	of	my	 respons 	 ibilities 	 	to	get	you	out	of	here	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	 stand 	 ing 	 	between	you	and	the	bar	.
and	the	good	news	is	i	do	n't	have	a	prepared	speech	,	but	i	have	a	box	of	 slide 	 s 	 	.	i	have	some	 picture 	 s 	 	that	represent	my	life	and	what	i	do	for	a	living	.
i	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	through	experience	that	people	remember	 picture 	 s 	 	long	after	they	've	 for 	 gotten 	 	 word 	 s 	 	,
and	so	i	hope	you	'll	remember	some	of	the	 picture 	 s 	 	i	'm	going	to	share	with	you	for	just	a	few	 minute 	 s 	 	.
the	whole	story	 re 	 ally 	 	 start 	 s 	 	with	me	 a 	 s 	 	a	high	school	kid	in	pittsburgh	,	pennsylvania	,	in	a	tough	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	that	 every 	 body 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	up	on	for	dead	.
and	on	a	wednesday	afternoon	,	i	was	 walk 	 ing 	 	down	the	corridor	of	my	high	school	kind	of	 mind 	 ing 	 	my	own	business	.	and	there	was	 th 	 is 	 	artist	 teach 	 ing 	 	,	who	made	a	great	big	old	ceramic	vessel	,
and	i	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	be	looking	in	the	door	of	the	art	room	--
and	if	you	've	ever	 s 	 een 	 	clay	 d 	 one 	 	,	it	's	magic	--	and	i	'd	never	 s 	 een 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	like	that	before	in	my	life	.
so	,	i	 walk 	 ed 	 	in	the	art	room	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	is	that	?	``
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 ceramic 	 s 	 	.	and	who	are	you	?	``	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'm	bill	strickland	.	i	want	you	to	teach	me	that	.	``	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	get	your	 home 	 room 	 	teacher	to	sign	a	piece	of	paper	that	 say 	 s 	 	you	can	come	here	,	and	i	'll	teach	it	to	you	.	``
and	so	for	the	 remain 	 ing 	 	two	 year 	 s 	 	of	my	high	school	,	i	cut	all	my	 class 	 es 	 	.
but	i	had	the	presence	of	mind	to	give	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	'	 class 	 es 	 	that	i	cut	the	 potter 	 y 	 	that	i	made	,
and	they	 g 	 ave 	 	me	 pass 	 ing 	 	 grade 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	how	i	got	out	of	high	school	.
and	mr.	ross	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	're	too	smart	to	die	and	i	do	n't	want	it	on	my	 con 	 science 	 	,	so	i	'm	 leav 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	school	and	i	'm	taking	you	with	me	.	``
and	he	drove	me	out	to	the	university	of	pittsburgh	where	i	 fill 	 ed 	 	out	a	college	application	and	got	in	on	 prob 	 ation 	 	.
well	,	i	'm	now	a	 trust 	 ee 	 	of	the	university	,	and	at	my	 install 	 ation 	 	 ce 	 re 	 mon 	 y 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'm	the	guy	who	came	from	the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	who	got	 in 	 to 	 	the	place	on	 prob 	 ation 	 	.
do	n't	give	up	on	the	poor	 kid 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	never	know	what	's	going	to	happen	to	 t 	 hose 	 	children	in	life	.	``
what	i	'm	going	to	show	you	for	a	couple	of	 minute 	 s 	 	is	a	 facil 	 ity 	 	that	i	built	in	the	 tough 	 est 	 	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	in	pittsburgh	with	the	highest	crime	rate	.
one	is	 call 	 ed 	 	bidwell	training	center	;	it	is	a	 voc 	 ation 	 al 	 	school	for	ex	-	steel	 work 	 ers 	 	and	single	 parent 	 s 	 	and	 wel 	 fare 	 	 mother 	 s 	 	.	you	remember	we	used	to	make	steel	in	pittsburgh	?
well	,	we	do	n't	make	any	steel	 any 	 more 	 	,	and	the	people	who	used	to	make	the	steel	are	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	tough	time	of	it	.
and	i	 re 	 build 	 	them	and	give	them	new	life	.
manchester	 craft 	 s 	 men 	 	's	guild	is	named	after	my	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	.
i	was	 adopt 	 ed 	 	by	the	bishop	of	the	episcopal	diocese	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	 riot 	 s 	 	,
and	he	 don 	 ated 	 	a	row	house	.	and	in	that	row	house	i	 start 	 ed 	 	manchester	 craft 	 s 	 men 	 	's	guild	,
and	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	that	 where 	 ver 	 	there	are	episcopalians	,	there	's	money	in	 ver 	 y 	 	close	 proxim 	 ity 	 	.
and	the	bishop	 adopt 	 ed 	 	me	 a 	 s 	 	his	kid	.
and	last	year	i	spoke	at	his	memorial	service	and	 wish 	 ed 	 	him	well	in	 th 	 is 	 	life	.
i	went	out	and	 hire 	 d 	 	a	student	of	frank	lloyd	wright	,	the	architect	,	and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	him	to	build	me	a	world	class	center	in	the	worst	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	in	pittsburgh	.
and	my	building	was	a	scale	model	for	the	pittsburgh	 air 	 port 	 	.
and	when	you	come	to	pittsburgh	--	and	you	're	all	 invit 	 ed 	 	--	you	'll	be	 fly 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	blown	-	up	version	of	my	building	.
that	's	the	building	.
built	in	a	tough	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	where	people	have	 be 	 en 	 	 give 	 n 	 	up	for	dead	.
my	view	is	that	if	you	want	to	involve	 your 	 self 	 	in	the	life	of	people	who	have	 be 	 en 	 	 give 	 n 	 	up	on	,	you	have	to	look	like	the	solution	and	not	the	problem	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	fountain	in	the	 court 	 yard 	 	.	and	the	reason	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	fountain	in	the	 court 	 yard 	 	is	i	 want 	 ed 	 	one
and	i	had	the	 check 	 book 	 	,	so	i	 b 	 ought 	 	one	and	put	it	there	.
and	now	that	i	'm	giving	 speech 	 es 	 	at	 con 	 ference 	 s 	 	like	ted	,	i	got	put	on	the	board	of	the	carnegie	museum	.	at	a	 re 	 ception 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 court 	 yard 	 	,	i	 notice 	 d 	 	that	they	had	a	fountain	 be 	 cause 	 	they	think	that	the	people	who	go	to	the	museum	deserve	a	fountain	.
well	,	i	think	that	 wel 	 fare 	 	 mother 	 s 	 	and	at	-	risk	 kid 	 s 	 	and	ex	-	steel	 work 	 ers 	 	deserve	a	fountain	in	 the 	 ir 	 	life	.
and	so	the	first	thing	that	you	see	in	my	center	in	the	 spring 	 time 	 	is	water	that	 greet 	 s 	 	you	--	water	is	life	and	water	of	human	 possibil 	 ity 	 	--
and	it	 set 	 s 	 	an	attitude	and	 expect 	 ation 	 	about	how	you	feel	about	people	before	you	ever	give	them	a	speech	.
so	,	from	that	fountain	i	built	 th 	 is 	 	building	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	world	class	art	,	and	it	's	all	my	taste	 be 	 cause 	 	i	raised	all	the	money	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	to	my	boy	,	``	when	you	raise	the	money	,	we	'll	put	your	taste	on	the	wall	.	``
that	we	have	 quilt 	 s 	 	and	clay	and	 call 	 i 	 graphy 	 	and	 every 	 where 	 	your	eye	 turn 	 s 	 	,	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	looking	back	at	you	,
that	's	 de 	 liberate 	 	.
that	's	intentional	.
in	my	view	,	it	is	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	world	that	can	redeem	the	soul	of	poor	people	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	 create 	 d 	 	a	 board 	 room 	 	,
and	i	 hire 	 d 	 	a	japanese	 cabinet 	 maker 	 	from	kyoto	,	japan	,	and	 commission 	 ed 	 	him	to	do	60	 piece 	 s 	 	of	furniture	for	our	building	.
we	have	since	 s 	 pun 	 	him	off	 in 	 to 	 	his	own	business	.
he	's	making	a	ton	of	money	 do 	 ing 	 	custom	furniture	for	rich	people	.
and	i	got	60	 piece 	 s 	 	out	of	it	for	my	school	 be 	 cause 	 	i	felt	that	 wel 	 fare 	 	 mom 	 s 	 	and	ex	-	steel	 work 	 ers 	 	and	single	 parent 	 s 	 	 deserve 	 d 	 	to	come	to	a	school	where	there	was	 hand 	 craft 	 ed 	 	furniture	that	 greet 	 ed 	 	them	every	day	.	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 set 	 s 	 	a	tone	and	an	attitude	about	how	you	feel	about	people	long	before	you	give	them	the	speech	.
we	even	have	 flower 	 s 	 	in	the	 hall 	 way 	 	,	and	they	're	not	plastic	.	 t 	 hose 	 	are	real	and	they	're	in	my	building	every	day	.
and	now	that	i	've	 give 	 n 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 speech 	 es 	 	,	we	had	a	bunch	of	high	school	 principal 	 s 	 	come	and	see	me	,	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	mr.	strickland	,	what	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	story	and	what	a	great	school	.
and	we	 we 	 re 	 	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 touch 	 ed 	 	by	the	 flower 	 s 	 	and	we	 we 	 re 	 	 cur 	 ious 	 	 a 	 s 	 	to	how	the	 flower 	 s 	 	got	there	.	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	i	got	in	my	car	and	i	went	out	to	the	 green 	 house 	 	and	i	 b 	 ought 	 	them	and	i	 br 	 ought 	 	them	back	and	i	put	them	there	.	``
you	do	n't	need	a	task	force	or	a	 stud 	 y 	 	group	to	buy	 flower 	 s 	 	for	your	 kid 	 s 	 	.
what	you	need	to	know	is	that	the	children	and	the	 adult 	 s 	 	deserve	 flower 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	life	.
the	cost	is	 incident 	 al 	 	but	the	 gest 	 ure 	 	is	huge	.
and	so	in	my	building	,	which	is	full	of	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	and	full	of	 flower 	 s 	 	,	we	 believ 	 e 	 	in	hope	and	human	 possibil 	 ities 	 	.
that	 happen 	 s 	 	to	be	at	christmas	time	.
and	so	the	next	thing	you	'll	see	is	a	million	dollar	kitchen	that	was	built	by	the	heinz	company	--	you	've	heard	of	them	?
they	did	all	right	in	the	 k 	 etch 	 up 	 	business	.
and	i	happen	to	know	that	company	 pre 	 tty 	 	well	 be 	 cause 	 	john	heinz	,	who	was	our	u.s.	senator	--	who	was	 tragic 	 ally 	 	 kill 	 ed 	 	in	a	plane	accident	--	he	had	heard	about	my	 desir 	 e 	 	to	build	a	new	building	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	had	a	 card 	 board 	 	box	and	i	put	it	in	a	garbage	bag	and	i	 walk 	 ing 	 	all	over	pittsburgh	 try 	 ing 	 	to	raise	money	for	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
and	he	 call 	 ed 	 	me	 in 	 to 	 	his	 off 	 ice 	 	--	which	is	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	going	to	see	the	wizard	of	oz	--	and	john	heinz	had	600	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	and	at	the	time	i	had	about	60	 cent 	 s 	 	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	but	we	've	heard	about	you	.
we	've	heard	about	your	work	with	the	 kid 	 s 	 	and	the	ex	-	steel	 work 	 ers 	 	,	and	we	're	 inc 	 lined 	 	to	want	to	support	your	 desir 	 e 	 	to	build	a	new	building	.
and	you	could	do	us	a	great	service	if	you	would	add	a	 cul 	 in 	 ary 	 	program	to	your	program	.	``	 be 	 cause 	 	back	then	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	building	a	 trade 	 s 	 	program	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	that	way	we	could	fulfill	our	 affirm 	 ative 	 	action	 goal 	 s 	 	for	the	heinz	company	.	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	senator	,	i	'm	 reluct 	 ant 	 	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	a	field	that	i	do	n't	know	much	about	,	but	i	promise	you	that	if	you	'll	support	my	school	,	i	'll	get	it	built	and	in	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	'll	come	back	and	weigh	out	that	program	that	you	 desir 	 e 	 	.	``
and	senator	heinz	 s 	 at 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 quiet 	 ly 	 	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	what	would	your	 re 	 action 	 	be	if	i	 s 	 aid 	 	i	'd	give	you	a	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	?	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	senator	,	it	 appear 	 s 	 	that	we	're	going	 in 	 to 	 	the	food	training	business	.	``
and	john	heinz	did	give	me	a	million	 buck 	 s 	 	.
and	most	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	he	 loan 	 ed 	 	me	the	head	of	research	for	the	heinz	company	.
and	we	kind	of	 borrow 	 ed 	 	the	curriculum	from	the	 cul 	 in 	 ary 	 	institute	of	america	,	which	in	 the 	 ir 	 	mind	is	kind	of	the	harvard	of	 cook 	 ing 	 	 school 	 s 	 	,
and	we	 create 	 d 	 	a	gourmet	 cook 	 s 	 	program	for	 wel 	 fare 	 	 mother 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	million	dollar	kitchen	in	the	middle	of	the	inner	city	.
and	we	've	never	 look 	 ed 	 	back	.
i	would	like	to	show	you	now	some	of	the	food	that	these	 wel 	 fare 	 	 mother 	 s 	 	do	in	 th 	 is 	 	million	dollar	kitchen	.
that	 happen 	 s 	 	to	be	our	cafeteria	line	.
that	's	puff	 past 	 ry 	 	day	.	why	?
 be 	 cause 	 	the	 student 	 s 	 	made	puff	 past 	 ry 	 	and	that	's	what	the	school	ate	every	day	.
but	the	 con 	 cept 	 	was	that	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	take	the	stigma	out	of	food	.
that	good	food	's	not	for	rich	people	--	good	food	's	for	 every 	 body 	 	on	the	planet	,	and	there	's	no	excuse	why	we	all	ca	n't	be	eating	it	.
so	at	my	school	,	we	subsidize	a	gourmet	lunch	program	for	 wel 	 fare 	 	 mother 	 s 	 	in	the	middle	of	the	inner	city	 be 	 cause 	 	we	've	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	it	's	good	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 stomach 	 s 	 	,	but	it	's	better	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 head 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	let	them	know	every	day	of	 the 	 ir 	 	life	that	they	have	value	at	 th 	 is 	 	place	i	call	my	center	.
we	have	 student 	 s 	 	who	 s 	 it 	 	together	,	black	 kid 	 s 	 	and	white	 kid 	 s 	 	,	and	what	we	've	 discover 	 ed 	 	is	you	can	solve	the	race	problem	by	creating	a	world	class	environment	,	 be 	 cause 	 	people	will	have	a	 tend 	 ency 	 	to	show	you	world	class	behavior	if	you	treat	them	in	that	way	.
these	are	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	the	food	that	 wel 	 fare 	 	 mother 	 s 	 	are	 do 	 ing 	 	after	six	 month 	 s 	 	in	the	training	program	.
no	 sophistic 	 ation 	 	,	no	class	,	no	dignity	,	no	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
what	we	've	 discover 	 ed 	 	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	wrong	with	poor	people	is	they	do	n't	have	any	money	,	which	 happen 	 s 	 	to	be	a	 cur 	 able 	 	condition	.
it	's	all	in	the	way	that	you	think	about	people	that	often	 determine 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	behavior	.
that	was	 d 	 one 	 	by	a	student	after	seven	 month 	 s 	 	in	the	program	,	 d 	 one 	 	by	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 brilli 	 ant 	 	young	woman	who	was	taught	by	our	 past 	 ry 	 	chef	.	i	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	eaten	seven	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 basket 	 s 	 	and	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	good	.
they	have	no	 calorie 	 s 	 	.
that	's	our	 din 	 ing 	 	room	.
it	 look 	 s 	 	like	your	average	high	school	cafeteria	in	your	average	town	in	america	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	view	of	how	 student 	 s 	 	ought	to	be	 treat 	 ed 	 	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	once	they	have	 be 	 en 	 	 push 	 ed 	 	 a 	 side 	 	.
we	train	pharmaceutical	 technician 	 s 	 	for	the	 pharma 	 cy 	 	industry	,
we	train	medical	 technician 	 s 	 	for	the	medical	industry	,
and	we	train	chemical	 technician 	 s 	 	for	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	like	bayer	and	calgon	carbon	and	 fish 	 er 	 	scientific	and	exxon	.
and	i	will	guarantee	you	that	if	you	come	to	my	center	in	pittsburgh	--	and	you	're	all	 invit 	 ed 	 	--	you	'll	see	 wel 	 fare 	 	 mother 	 s 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 analytic 	 al 	 	 chemist 	 ry 	 	with	 log 	 arithmic 	 	 calcul 	 ators 	 	10	 month 	 s 	 	from	 enroll 	 ing 	 	in	the	program	.
there	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	no	reason	why	poor	people	ca	n't	learn	world	class	technology	.
what	we	've	 discover 	 ed 	 	is	you	have	to	give	them	 flower 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	and	food	and	 expect 	 ations 	 	and	herbie	's	music	,	and	you	can	cure	a	spiritual	cancer	every	time	.
we	train	corporate	travel	 agent 	 s 	 	for	the	travel	industry	.
we	even	teach	people	how	to	read	.
the	kid	with	the	red	 strip 	 e 	 	was	in	the	program	two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	--	he	's	now	an	 instruct 	 or 	 	.
and	i	have	children	with	high	school	 diploma 	 s 	 	that	they	ca	n't	read	.
and	so	you	must	ask	 your 	 self 	 	the	question	:	how	is	it	possible	in	the	21st	century	that	we	graduate	children	from	 school 	 s 	 	who	ca	n't	read	the	 diploma 	 s 	 	that	they	have	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	?
the	reason	is	that	the	system	 get 	 s 	 	 reimburs 	 ed 	 	for	the	 kid 	 s 	 	they	 s 	 pit 	 	out	the	other	end	,	not	the	children	who	read	.
i	can	take	these	children	and	in	20	 week 	 s 	 	,	 demonst 	 rated 	 	 apt 	 itude 	 	;	i	can	get	them	high	school	 equi 	 valent 	 	.
no	big	deal	.
that	's	our	library	with	more	 hand 	 craft 	 ed 	 	furniture	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 art 	 s 	 	program	i	 start 	 ed 	 	in	1968	.
remember	i	'm	the	black	kid	from	the	'60s	who	got	his	life	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	with	 ceramic 	 s 	 	.
well	,	i	went	out	and	 decide 	 d 	 	to	 re 	 produce 	 	my	experience	with	other	 kid 	 s 	 	in	the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	,	the	 theor 	 y 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	if	you	get	 kid 	 s 	 	 flower 	 s 	 	and	you	give	them	food	and	you	give	them	 s 	 un 	 shine 	 	and	 ent 	 husiasm 	 	,	you	can	 br 	 ing 	 	them	right	back	to	life	.
i	have	400	 kid 	 s 	 	from	the	pittsburgh	public	school	system	that	come	to	me	every	day	of	the	week	for	 art 	 s 	 	education	.
and	these	are	children	who	are	 flu 	 nk 	 ing 	 	out	of	public	school	.
and	last	year	i	put	88	percent	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	in	college	and	i	've	 average 	 d 	 	over	80	percent	for	15	 year 	 s 	 	.
we	've	made	a	 fasci 	 nating 	 	 discover 	 y 	 	:	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	wrong	with	the	 kid 	 s 	 	that	 affect 	 ion 	 	and	 s 	 un 	 shine 	 	and	food	and	 ent 	 husiasm 	 	and	herbie	's	music	ca	n't	cure	.
for	that	i	won	a	big	old	 pla 	 que 	 	--	man	of	the	year	in	education	.
i	beat	out	all	the	ph.d.	's	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 figur 	 ed 	 	that	if	you	treat	children	like	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	it	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	the	 like 	 li 	 hood 	 	they	're	going	to	 behav 	 e 	 	that	way	.
and	why	we	ca	n't	institute	that	policy	in	every	school	and	in	every	city	and	every	town	 remain 	 s 	 	a	 myster 	 y 	 	to	me	.
let	me	show	you	what	these	people	do	.
we	have	 ceramic 	 s 	 	and	 photograph 	 y 	 	and	computer	 im 	 aging 	 	.	and	these	are	all	 kid 	 s 	 	with	no	 art 	 istic 	 	ability	,	no	talent	,	no	 imagin 	 ation 	 	.	and	we	 br 	 ing 	 	in	the	world	's	 great 	 est 	 	 artist 	 s 	 	--	gordon	 park 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	there	,	chester	higgins	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	there	--	and	what	we	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	is	that	the	children	will	 be 	 come 	 	like	the	people	who	teach	them	.
in	fact	,	i	 br 	 ought 	 	in	a	mosaic	artist	from	the	vatican	,	an	african	-	american	woman	who	had	 stud 	 ied 	 	the	old	vatican	mosaic	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	,	and	let	me	show	you	what	they	did	with	the	work	.
these	 we 	 re 	 	children	who	the	whole	world	had	 give 	 n 	 	up	on	,	who	 we 	 re 	 	 flu 	 nk 	 ing 	 	out	of	public	school	,	and	that	's	what	they	're	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 do 	 ing 	 	with	 affect 	 ion 	 	and	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	and	food	and	good	music	and	confidence	.
we	teach	 photograph 	 y 	 	.
and	these	are	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	some	of	the	 kid 	 s 	 	'	work	.
that	boy	won	a	four	-	year	 scholar 	 ship 	 	on	the	strength	of	that	photograph	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	our	 gall 	 ery 	 	.
we	have	a	world	class	 gall 	 ery 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 believ 	 e 	 	that	poor	 kid 	 s 	 	need	a	world	class	 gall 	 ery 	 	,
so	i	designed	 th 	 is 	 	thing	.
we	have	 smok 	 ed 	 	 s 	 al 	 mon 	 	at	the	art	 open 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	we	have	a	 form 	 al 	 	 print 	 ed 	 	 invit 	 ation 	 	,	and	i	even	have	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	a	way	to	get	 the 	 ir 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	to	come	.	i	could	n't	buy	a	parent	15	 year 	 s 	 	ago
so	i	 hire 	 d 	 	a	guy	who	got	off	on	the	jesus	big	time	.
he	was	 drag 	 ging 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	out	of	 bar 	 s 	 	and	saving	 t 	 hose 	 	 live 	 s 	 	for	the	lord	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	bill	,	i	want	to	hire	you	,	man	.
you	have	to	tone	down	the	jesus	stuff	a	little	bit	,	but	keep	the	 ent 	 husiasm 	 	.
i	ca	n't	get	these	 parent 	 s 	 	to	come	to	the	school	.	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'll	get	them	to	come	to	the	school	.	``
so	,	he	 jump 	 ed 	 	in	the	van	,	he	went	to	 mis 	 s 	 	jones	'	house	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 mis 	 s 	 	jones	,	i	 k 	 new 	 	you	 want 	 ed 	 	to	come	to	your	kid	's	art	 open 	 ing 	 	but	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	did	n't	have	a	ride	.
so	,	i	came	to	give	you	a	ride	.	``
and	he	got	10	 parent 	 s 	 	and	then	20	 parent 	 s 	 	.
at	the	last	show	that	we	did	,	200	 parent 	 s 	 	 show 	 ed 	 	up	and	we	did	n't	pick	up	one	parent	.
 be 	 cause 	 	now	it	's	 be 	 come 	 	 social 	 ly 	 	not	 accept 	 able 	 	not	to	show	up	to	support	your	children	at	the	manchester	 craft 	 s 	 men 	 	's	guild	 be 	 cause 	 	people	think	you	're	bad	 parent 	 s 	 	.
and	there	is	no	 statistic 	 al 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	the	white	 parent 	 s 	 	and	the	black	 parent 	 s 	 	.
 mother 	 s 	 	will	go	where	 the 	 ir 	 	children	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 celebr 	 ated 	 	,	every	time	,	every	town	,	every	city	.

and	by	the	time	i	cut	these	 kid 	 s 	 	loose	from	high	school	,	they	've	got	four	 show 	 s 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	resume	before	they	 app 	 ly 	 	to	college	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	all	up	here	.
you	have	to	change	the	way	that	people	see	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	before	you	can	change	 the 	 ir 	 	behavior	.
and	it	's	 work 	 ed 	 	out	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	up	to	 th 	 is 	 	day	.

that	's	 initi 	 ating 	 	the	relationship	.
we	got	it	just	 d 	 one 	 	in	time	to	show	you	,

in	1986	,	i	had	the	presence	of	mind	to	stick	a	music	hall	on	the	north	end	of	the	building	while	i	was	building	it	.

and	i	 record 	 ed 	 	it	and	we	won	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	a	grammy	.
and	like	a	fool	,	i	did	n't	go	to	the	 ce 	 re 	 mon 	 y 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	did	n't	think	we	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	win	.
well	,	we	did	win	,
and	our	name	was	 liter 	 ally 	 	in	 light 	 s 	 	over	madison	square	garden	.

if	you	'd	have	 drop 	 ped 	 	a	bomb	on	that	room	,	you	'd	have	 wipe 	 d 	 	out	all	the	money	in	pennsylvania	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	all	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	.	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	my	mother	and	father	,	who	lived	long	 en 	 ough 	 	to	see	 the 	 ir 	 	kid	build	that	building	.

and	that	was	our	first	 record 	 ing 	 	studio	,	which	was	the	 b 	 room 	 	 close 	 t 	 	.
we	put	the	 mop 	 s 	 	in	the	 hall 	 way 	 	and	re	-	engineered	the	thing	and	that	's	where	we	 record 	 ed 	 	the	first	grammy	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	our	new	 facil 	 ity 	 	,	which	is	all	video	technology	.
and	that	is	a	room	that	was	built	for	a	woman	named	nancy	wilson	,	who	 record 	 ed 	 	that	 al 	 bum 	 	at	our	school	last	christmas	.

 th 	 is 	 	was	 burn 	 ed 	 	out	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	 riot 	 s 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	next	to	my	building	--	and	so	i	had	 an 	 other 	 	 card 	 board 	 	box	built	and	i	 walk 	 ed 	 	back	out	in	the	 street 	 s 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	that	's	the	building	,	and	that	's	the	model	,	and	on	the	right	's	a	high	-	tech	 green 	 house 	 	and	in	the	middle	's	the	medical	technology	building	.
and	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	 pleas 	 ed 	 	to	tell	you	that	the	building	's	 d 	 one 	 	.	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	full	of	anchor	 ten 	 ants 	 	at	20	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	foot	--	triple	that	in	the	middle	of	the	inner	city	.
and	there	's	the	fountain	.
every	building	 ha 	 s 	 	a	fountain	.
and	the	university	of	pittsburgh	medical	center	are	anchor	 ten 	 ants 	 	and	they	took	half	the	building	,
and	we	now	train	medical	 technician 	 s 	 	through	all	 the 	 ir 	 	system	.
and	mellon	bank	's	a	 ten 	 ant 	 	.
and	i	love	them	 be 	 cause 	 	they	pay	the	rent	on	time	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	the	 associ 	 ation 	 	,	i	'm	now	a	director	of	the	mellon	financial	corporation	that	 b 	 ought 	 	dreyfus	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	in	the	process	of	 be 	 ing 	 	built	 a 	 s 	 	we	speak	.
 multi 	 ply 	 	that	picture	 time 	 s 	 	four	and	you	will	see	the	 green 	 house 	 	that	's	going	to	open	in	october	 th 	 is 	 	year	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	going	to	grow	 t 	 hose 	 	 flower 	 s 	 	in	the	middle	of	the	inner	city	.
and	we	're	going	to	have	high	school	 kid 	 s 	 	growing	phalaenopsis	 orchid 	 s 	 	in	the	middle	of	the	inner	city	.	and	we	have	a	 hand 	 shake 	 	with	one	of	the	large	 re 	 tail 	 	 grocer 	 s 	 	to	sell	our	 orchid 	 s 	 	in	all	240	 store 	 s 	 	in	six	 state 	 s 	 	.
and	our	 partner 	 s 	 	are	zuma	canyon	 orchid 	 s 	 	of	malibu	,	california	,	who	are	hispanic	.
so	,	the	hispanics	and	the	black	 folk 	 s 	 	have	 form 	 ed 	 	a	 partner 	 ship 	 	to	grow	high	technology	 orchid 	 s 	 	in	the	middle	of	the	inner	city	.
and	i	told	my	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	senator	that	there	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	high	 prob 	 ability 	 	that	if	he	could	find	some	 fund 	 ing 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	would	 be 	 come 	 	a	left	-	hand	column	in	the	wall	street	journal	,
to	which	he	 read 	 ily 	 	 agree 	 d 	 	.
and	we	got	the	 fund 	 ing 	 	and	we	open	in	the	fall	.
and	you	ought	to	come	and	see	it	--	it	's	going	to	be	a	hell	of	a	story	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	want	to	do	when	i	grow	up	.
the	 brow 	 n 	 	building	is	the	one	you	 guy 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	looking	at	and	i	'll	tell	you	where	i	made	my	big	 mistak 	 e 	 	.
i	had	a	chance	to	buy	 th 	 is 	 	whole	industrial	park	--	which	is	less	than	1,000	feet	from	the	 river 	 front 	 	--	for	four	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	and	i	did	n't	do	it	.
and	i	built	the	first	building	,	and	guess	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	?
i	 appreciate 	 d 	 	the	real	 e 	 state 	 	 value 	 s 	 	beyond	 every 	 body 	 	's	 expect 	 ations 	 	and	the	 owner 	 s 	 	of	the	park	 turn 	 ed 	 	me	down	for	eight	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	last	year	,
and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	mr.	strickland	,	you	ought	to	get	the	civic	 lead 	 er 	 	of	the	year	 a 	 ward 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	you	've	 appreciate 	 d 	 	our	 proper 	 ty 	 	 value 	 s 	 	beyond	our	 wild 	 est 	 	 expect 	 ations 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	for	that	.	``
the	moral	of	the	story	is	you	must	be	prepared	to	act	on	your	 dream 	 s 	 	,	just	in	case	they	do	come	true	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	picture	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	in	a	place	 call 	 ed 	 	san	francisco	.
and	the	reason	 th 	 is 	 	picture	's	in	here	is	i	did	 th 	 is 	 	slide	show	a	couple	 year 	 s 	 	ago	at	a	big	 economic 	 s 	 	 summ 	 it 	 	,	and	there	was	a	fellow	in	the	audience	who	came	up	to	me	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	man	,	that	's	a	great	story	.
i	want	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	.	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	 flatter 	 ed 	 	.	what	do	you	do	for	a	living	?	``
he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	run	the	city	of	san	francisco	.

and	so	i	kind	of	 accept 	 ed 	 	the	 flatter 	 y 	 	and	the	praise	and	put	it	out	of	my	mind	.
and	that	 week 	 end 	 	,	i	was	going	back	home	and	herbie	hancock	was	 play 	 ing 	 	our	center	that	night	--	first	time	i	'd	met	him	.
and	he	 walk 	 ed 	 	in	and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	what	is	 th 	 is 	 	?	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	herbie	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	 con 	 cept 	 	of	a	training	center	for	poor	people	.	``

and	she	 turn 	 ed 	 	that	audience	around	on	a	pin	.
and	i	 promise 	 d 	 	these	people	that	i	was	going	to	build	 th 	 is 	 	thing	,
and	we	're	going	to	build	it	all	right	.
and	i	think	we	can	get	in	the	ground	 th 	 is 	 	year	 a 	 s 	 	the	first	 replica 	 tion 	 	of	the	center	in	pittsburgh	.
but	i	met	a	guy	named	quincy	jones	 a 	 long 	 	the	way	and	i	 show 	 ed 	 	him	the	box	of	 slide 	 s 	 	.
and	quincy	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	want	to	help	you	,	man	.

and	so	he	's	 assemble 	 d 	 	a	group	of	people	.	and	i	've	 fall 	 en 	 	in	love	with	him	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	have	with	herbie	and	with	his	music	.
and	quincy	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	where	did	the	idea	for	 center 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	come	from	?	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	it	came	from	your	music	,	man	.	 be 	 cause 	 	mr.	ross	used	to	 br 	 ing 	 	in	your	 al 	 bum 	 s 	 	when	i	was	16	 year 	 s 	 	old	in	the	 potter 	 y 	 	class	,	when	the	world	was	all	dark	,	and	your	music	got	me	to	the	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	.	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	if	i	can	follow	that	music	,	i	'll	get	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	and	i	'll	be	ok	.
and	if	that	's	not	true	,	how	did	i	get	here	?	``
i	want	you	all	to	know	that	i	think	the	world	is	a	place	that	's	worth	living	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	in	you	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	in	your	 hope 	 s 	 	and	your	 dream 	 s 	 	,
i	 believ 	 e 	 	in	your	 intellig 	 ence 	 
and	i	 believ 	 e 	 	in	your	 ent 	 husiasm 	 	.
and	i	'm	 tire 	 d 	 	of	living	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	going	 in 	 to 	 	town	after	town	with	people	 stand 	 ing 	 	around	on	 corner 	 s 	 	with	 hole 	 s 	 	where	 eye 	 s 	 	used	to	be	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 spirit 	 s 	 	 damage 	 d 	 	.
we	wo	n't	make	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	country	 un 	 less 	 	we	can	turn	 th 	 is 	 	thing	around	.
in	pennsylvania	it	 cost 	 s 	 	60,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	keep	people	in	jail	,	most	of	whom	look	like	me	.
it	's	40,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	build	the	university	of	pittsburgh	medical	school	.	it	's	20,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	 cheap 	 er 	 	to	build	a	medical	school	than	to	keep	people	in	jail	.
do	the	math	--	it	will	never	work	.
i	am	 bank 	 ing 	 	on	you	and	i	'm	 bank 	 ing 	 	on	 guy 	 s 	 	like	herbie	and	quincy	and	hackett	and	richard	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 de 	 cent 	 	people	who	still	 believ 	 e 	 	in	 some 	 thing 	 	.
and	i	want	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	in	my	 life 	 time 	 	,	in	every	city	and	in	every	town	.
and	i	do	n't	think	i	'm	crazy	.
i	think	we	can	get	home	on	 th 	 is 	 	thing	and	i	think	we	can	build	these	all	over	the	country	for	less	money	than	we	're	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	on	 pri 	 son 	 s 	 	.
and	i	 believ 	 e 	 	we	can	turn	 th 	 is 	 	whole	story	around	to	one	of	 celebr 	 ation 	 	and	one	of	hope	.
in	my	business	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	work	.	you	're	 al 	 ways 	 	 fight 	 ing 	 	 up 	 stream 	 	like	a	 s 	 al 	 mon 	 	--	never	 en 	 ough 	 	money	,	too	much	need	--
and	so	there	is	a	 tend 	 ency 	 	to	have	an	 occupation 	 al 	 	 depress 	 ion 	 	that	 accompani 	 es 	 	my	work	.
and	so	i	've	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	,	over	time	,	the	solution	to	the	 depress 	 ion 	 	:	you	make	a	friend	in	every	town	and	you	'll	never	be	 lone 	 ly 	 	.
and	my	hope	is	that	i	've	made	a	few	here	 to 	 night 	 	.
and	 thank 	 s 	 	for	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	what	i	had	to	say	.
