let	me	start	some	place	.	i	'm	 interest 	 ed 	 	--	i	kind	of	do	the	same	thing	,	but	i	do	n't	move	my	body	.
and	 in 	 stead 	 	of	using	human	 figure 	 s 	 	to	develop	 idea 	 s 	 	of	time	and	space	,	i	work	in	the	mineral	world	.	i	work	with	more	or	less	 in 	 ert 	 	matter	.
and	i	organize	it	.	and	,	well	,	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	bit	different	 be 	 cause 	 	an	architect	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	,	let	's	say	,	a	dance	company	 final 	 ly 	 	is	a	 negoti 	 ation 	 	between	one	's	private	world	,	one	's	conceptual	world	,	the	world	of	 idea 	 s 	 	,	the	world	of	 aspir 	 ations 	 	,	of	 invent 	 ions 	 	,	with	the	relationship	of	the	 ex 	 terior 	 	world	and	all	the	 limit 	 ations 	 	,	the	naysayers	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	have	to	say	,	for	my	whole	 care 	 er 	 	,	if	there	's	 any 	 thing 	 	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	 consist 	 ent 	 	,	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	that	you	ca	n't	do	it	.
no	matter	what	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	,	what	i	've	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	do	,	 every 	 body 	 	 say 	 s 	 	it	ca	n't	be	 d 	 one 	 	.
and	it	's	 continu 	 ous 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	complete	spectrum	of	the	 vari 	 ous 	 	kind	of	 real 	 ities 	 	that	you	confront	with	your	 idea 	 s 	 	.
and	to	be	an	architect	,	 some 	 how 	 	you	have	to	 negoti 	 ate 	 	between	left	and	right	,	and	you	have	to	 negoti 	 ate 	 	between	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	private	place	where	 idea 	 s 	 	take	place	and	the	 out 	 side 	 	world	,	and	then	make	it	 under 	 stood 	 	.
i	can	start	any	number	of	 place 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	process	is	 al 	 so 	 	--	i	think	--	 ver 	 y 	 	different	from	some	of	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	 session 	 s 	 	,	which	you	had	 s 	 uch 	 	a	kind	of	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	,	 s 	 uch 	 	a	lineal	idea	,	like	the	last	one	,	say	,	with	howard	,	that	i	think	the	creative	process	in	 architect 	 ure 	 	,	the	design	process	,	is	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 circuit 	 ous 	 	.	it	's	 labyrinth 	 ine 	 	.
it	's	calvino	's	idea	of	the	 quick 	 est 	 	way	between	two	 point 	 s 	 	is	the	 circuit 	 ous 	 	line	,	not	the	straight	line	.
and	 definite 	 ly 	 	my	life	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	part	of	that	.
i	'm	going	to	start	with	some	simple	kind	of	 not 	 ions 	 	of	how	we	organize	 thing 	 s 	 	.
but	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	what	we	do	is	,	we	try	to	give	 cohere 	 nce 	 	to	the	world	.
we	make	physical	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 building 	 s 	 	that	 be 	 come 	 	a	part	in	an	accretional	process	;	they	make	cities	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	are	the	 reflect 	 ion 	 	of	the	 process 	 es 	 	,	and	the	time	that	they	are	made	.
and	what	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	is	 attempt 	 ing 	 	to	synthesize	the	way	one	 s 	 ees 	 	the	world	and	the	 territ 	 ories 	 	which	are	 use 	 ful 	 	 a 	 s 	 	generative	material	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	all	i	'm	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	,	 al 	 ways 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	architect	,	is	the	way	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 produce 	 d 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	what	i	do	.	right	?
and	it	's	not	based	on	an	a	priori	 not 	 ion 	 	.
i	have	no	interest	at	all	in	 conceiv 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	in	my	brain	and	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	.	``	in	fact	,	 some 	 body 	 	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	--	ewan	,	 may 	 be 	 	it	was	you	in	your	 introduc 	 tion 	 	--	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 architect 	 s 	 	--	did	 some 	 body 	 	say	it	's	what	business	people	come	to	,	it	's	what	the	corporate	world	 come 	 s 	 	to	when	they	want	to	make	it	look	like	 some 	 thing 	 	at	the	end	of	the	line	?	huh	.	 w 	 ow 	 	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	that	way	for	me	at	all	.
i	have	no	interest	in	that	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	.
 architect 	 ure 	 	is	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	 some 	 thing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	--	if	you	're	not	 involve 	 d 	 	in	first	 principle 	 s 	 	,	if	you	're	not	 involve 	 d 	 	in	the	absolute	,	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	that	generative	process	,	it	's	cake	 decor 	 ation 	 	.
and	i	've	 noth 	 ing 	 	wrong	with	cake	 decor 	 ation 	 	and	cake	decorators	,	if	 any 	 body 	 	's	 involve 	 d 	 	in	cake	 decor 	 ations 	 	--	it	's	not	what	i	'm	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 do 	 ing 	 	.
and	so	,	in	the	 form 	 ation 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	,	in	giving	it	form	,	in	concretizing	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	it	 start 	 s 	 	with	some	 not 	 ion 	 	of	how	one	 organize 	 s 	 	.
and	i	've	had	for	30	 year 	 s 	 	an	interest	in	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 complex 	 ities 	 	where	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 force 	 s 	 	are	 br 	 ought 	 	to	bear	,	and	to	understand	the	nature	of	the	final	result	of	that	,	 represent 	 ing 	 	the	building	 it 	 self 	 	.
there	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	 continu 	 al 	 	relationship	between	 invent 	 ions 	 	,	which	are	private	,	and	 re 	 ality 	 	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	me	.
a	project	which	is	part	of	an	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	in	copenhagen	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	which	was	the	 model 	 ing 	 	of	a	 hippo 	 campus 	 	--	the	 territ 	 ory 	 	of	the	brain	that	 record 	 s 	 	short	-	term	 memor 	 y 	 	--	and	the	 document 	 ation 	 	of	that	,	the	 imagin 	 ative 	 	and	 document 	 ation 	 	of	that	through	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 draw 	 ing 	 s 	 	which	 liter 	 ally 	 	attempt	to	organize	that	experience	.
and	it	had	to	do	with	the	 not 	 ion 	 	of	 walk 	 ing 	 	a	kilometer	,	 observ 	 ing 	 	every	kilometer	a	 part 	 icular 	 	object	of	 desir 	 e 	 	,	and	then	placing	that	 with 	 in 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	the	 not 	 ion 	 	was	that	i	could	make	an	 organ 	 ization 	 	not	built	on	normal	coherencies	,	but	built	on	non	-	 s 	 equ 	 iturs 	 	,	built	on	 random 	 ness 	 	.
and	i	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	of	 random 	 ness 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	 produce 	 s 	 	 architect 	 ural 	 	work	and	 a 	 s 	 	it	 definite 	 ly 	 	 connect 	 s 	 	to	the	 not 	 ion 	 	of	the	city	,	an	accretional	 not 	 ion 	 	of	the	city	,	and	that	led	to	 vari 	 ous 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	of	 organ 	 ization 	 	.
and	then	 th 	 is 	 	led	to	 broad 	 er 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	of	 building 	 s 	 	that	come	together	through	the	 multi 	 plicit 	 y 	 	of	 system 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	not	any	single	system	that	 make 	 s 	 	the	work	.
it	's	the	relationship	--	it	's	the	 dynamic 	 s 	 	between	the	 system 	 s 	 	--	which	have	the	power	to	transform	and	invent	and	produce	an	 architect 	 ure 	 	that	is	--	that	would	 other 	 wise 	 	not	exist	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	 system 	 s 	 	could	be	identified	,	and	of	course	,	 to 	 day 	 	,	with	the	technology	of	the	computer	and	with	the	rapid	 proto 	 ty 	 ping 	 	,	etc	.	,	we	have	the	 mechan 	 ism 	 s 	 	to	understand	and	to	respond	to	these	 system 	 s 	 	,	and	to	allow	them	to	adjust	to	the	 vari 	 ous 	 	accommodations	of	 functional 	 ities 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	all	we	do	.
we	're	producing	 space 	 s 	 	that	 accommo 	 date 	 	human	activity	.
and	what	i	'm	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	is	not	the	 styl 	 ing 	 	of	that	,	but	the	relationship	of	that	 a 	 s 	 	it	 enhance 	 s 	 	that	activity	.
and	that	 direct 	 ly 	 	 connect 	 s 	 	to	 idea 	 s 	 	of	city	-	making	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	project	that	we	just	 finish 	 ed 	 	in	penang	for	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	large	city	project	that	came	 direct 	 ly 	 	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	process	,	which	is	the	result	of	the	 multi 	 plicit 	 y 	 	of	 force 	 s 	 	that	produce	it	.
and	the	project	--	 aga 	 in 	 	,	enormous	,	enormous	 com 	 petition 	 	--	on	the	hudson	river	and	in	new	york	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	do	three	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	which	uses	these	 process 	 es 	 	.
and	what	you	're	looking	at	are	 possibil 	 ities 	 	that	have	to	do	with	the	generation	of	the	city	 a 	 s 	 	one	 appli 	 es 	 	a	 method 	 ology 	 	that	uses	 not 	 ions 	 	of	these	 multi 	 ple 	 	 force 	 s 	 	,	that	 deal 	 s 	 	with	the	 e 	 norm 	 ity 	 	of	the	problem	,	the	 complex 	 ity 	 	of	the	problem	,	when	we	're	 design 	 ing 	 	cities	at	 large 	 r 	 	and	 large 	 r 	 	 aggreg 	 ates 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	one	of	the	 issue 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	is	that	the	economic	 aggreg 	 ate 	 	is	 driv 	 ing 	 	the	 develop 	 ment 	 	 aggreg 	 ate 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	the	 aggreg 	 ates 	 	get	 large 	 r 	 	we	 requir 	 e 	 	more	and	more	complex	investigation	 process 	 es 	 	to	solve	these	 problem 	 s 	 	.
and	that	led	us	 direct 	 ly 	 	to	the	olympic	village	.
i	was	in	new	york	on	monday	 present 	 ing 	 	it	to	the	ioc	.
we	won	the	 com 	 petition 	 	--	what	was	it	,	nine	 month 	 s 	 	ago	?
 aga 	 in 	 	,	a	direct	 reflect 	 ion 	 	from	using	these	 process 	 es 	 	to	develop	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	large	-	scale	 organism 	 s 	 	.
and	then	,	 al 	 so 	 	,	was	 work 	 ing 	 	with	broad	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	we	 on 	 ly 	 	used	15	of	the	60	 acre 	 s 	 	of	land	,	and	the	45	 acre 	 s 	 	was	a	park	and	would	 be 	 come 	 	the	 leg 	 acy 	 	of	the	olympic	village	.
and	it	would	 be 	 come 	 	the	second	largest	park	in	the	 bo 	 rough 	 s 	 	,	etc	.
 it 	 s 	 	position	,	of	course	,	in	the	middle	of	manhattan	--	it	's	on	hunter	's	point	.
and	then	the	 broad 	 er 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	of	city	-	making	start	 hav 	 ing 	 	direct	 influence 	 s 	 	on	 architect 	 ure 	 	,	on	the	 element 	 s 	 	that	make	up	the	 broad 	 er 	 	scheme	,	the	 building 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	and	start	 gui 	 d 	 ing 	 	us	.
 architect 	 ure 	 	for	me	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	an	investigation	of	a	 multi 	 plicit 	 y 	 	of	 force 	 s 	 	that	could	come	from	 liter 	 ally 	 	any	place	.
and	so	i	can	start	 th 	 is 	 	 discuss 	 ion 	 	in	any	number	of	 place 	 s 	 	,	and	i	've	 chose 	 n 	 	three	or	four	to	talk	about	.
and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	to	do	with	an	interest	in	the	vast	kind	of	 territ 	 ory 	 	that	 architect 	 ure 	 	 touch 	 es 	 	.
it	 liter 	 ally 	 	is	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	 any 	 thing 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	knowledge	base	.
there	's	just	no	place	that	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 some 	 how 	 	have	a	 connect 	 ive 	 	tissue	to	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	jim	dine	,	and	it	's	the	 ab 	 s 	 ence 	 	of	presence	,	etc	.
it	's	the	 cloth 	 ing 	 	,	the	skin	,	 with 	 out 	 	the	presence	of	the	character	.
it	 be 	 came 	 	kind	of	an	idea	for	the	 not 	 ion 	 	of	the	surface	of	a	work	,	and	it	was	used	in	a	project	where	we	could	unravel	that	surface	,	and	it	was	a	figurative	idea	that	was	going	to	be	 fold 	 ed 	 	and	made	 in 	 to 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	kind	of	complex	space	.
and	the	idea	was	the	relationship	of	the	space	,	which	was	made	up	of	the	fold	of	the	image	,	and	the	 dialect 	 ic 	 	or	the	conflict	between	the	figuration	,	and	the	 clar 	 ity 	 	of	the	image	and	the	 complex 	 ity 	 	of	the	space	,	which	 we 	 re 	 	in	 dia 	 log 	 	.	and	it	made	us	 re 	 think 	 	the	whole	 not 	 ion 	 	of	how	we	work	and	how	we	make	 thing 	 s 	 	,
and	it	led	us	to	 idea 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 close 	 r 	 	to	fashion	design	 a 	 s 	 	we	 flatten 	 ed 	 	out	 surface 	 s 	 	,	and	then	 br 	 ought 	 	them	back	together	 a 	 s 	 	they	could	make	spatial	 combination 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	first	prototype	in	korea	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	're	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	a	dynamic	 envelop 	 e 	 	,	and	then	the	same	 character 	 istic 	 	of	the	fabric	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	material	 ident 	 ity 	 	and	it	's	 trans 	 lu 	 cent 	 	and	it	's	 por 	 ous 	 	,	and	it	 allow 	 s 	 	us	for	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	 not 	 ion 	 	of	what	a	skin	of	a	building	is	.
and	that	 turn 	 ed 	 	right	away	 in 	 to 	 	 an 	 other 	 	project	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	caltrans	building	in	los	angeles	.
and	now	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	skin	and	the	body	is	 different 	 iated 	 	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 not 	 ion 	 	.
if	you	look	at	most	 building 	 s 	 	,	what	you	look	at	is	the	building	,	the	facade	,	and	it	is	the	building	.
and	all	of	a	sudden	we	're	kind	of	moving	away	,	and	we	're	 separat 	 ing 	 	the	skin	from	the	body	,	and	that	's	going	to	lead	to	 broad 	 er 	 	performance	 cri 	 ter 	 ia 	 	,	which	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	in	a	minute	.
and	you	're	looking	at	how	it	 d 	 rape 	 s 	 	over	and	 different 	 iate 	 s 	 	from	the	body	.
and	then	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	building	 it 	 self 	 	,	middle	of	los	angeles	,	right	 a 	 cross 	 	from	city	hall	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	it	 move 	 s 	 	,	it	 take 	 s 	 	 piece 	 s 	 	of	the	earth	with	it	.	it	 bend 	 s 	 	up	.
it	's	part	of	a	sign	system	,	which	was	part	of	the	kind	of	 leg 	 acy 	 	of	los	angeles	--	the	two	-	dimension	,	three	-	dimension	 sign 	 ing 	 	,	etc	.
and	then	it	 allow 	 s 	 	one	to	penetrate	the	work	 it 	 self 	 	.
it	's	 trans 	 parent 	 	,	and	it	 allow 	 s 	 	you	to	understand	,	i	think	,	what	is	 al 	 ways 	 	the	most	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	in	any	building	,	which	is	the	actual	constructional	 process 	 es 	 	that	make	it	.
and	it	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	most	 intens 	 e 	 	kind	of	 territ 	 ory 	 	of	the	work	,	which	is	not	occupied	,
 be 	 cause 	 	 architect 	 ure 	 	is	 al 	 ways 	 	the	most	 interest 	 ing 	 	in	some	 mechan 	 ism 	 	when	it	's	 separat 	 ed 	 	from	function	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	area	that	 allow 	 s 	 	for	that	.
and	then	the	skin	 start 	 s 	 	 transform 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	other	 material 	 s 	 	.
we	're	using	light	 a 	 s 	 	a	building	material	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	.
we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	with	keith	sonnier	in	new	york	,	and	we	're	making	 th 	 is 	 	large	 out 	 side 	 	room	,	which	is	possible	in	los	angeles	,	and	which	is	 ver 	 y 	 	much	 reflect 	 ive 	 	of	the	urban	,	the	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	urban	 environment 	 s 	 	that	you	would	find	in	shibuya	or	you	'd	find	in	mexico	city	or	sao	paulo	,	etc	.	,	that	have	to	do	with	 activ 	 ating 	 	the	city	over	a	 long 	 er 	 	span	of	time	.
and	that	was	 ver 	 y 	 	much	part	of	the	 not 	 ion 	 	of	the	urban	 object 	 ive 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	project	in	los	angeles	.
and	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	all	of	it	promoting	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	.
and	an	image	which	may	be	 close 	 st 	 	 talk 	 s 	 	about	the	use	of	light	 a 	 s 	 	a	medium	,	that	light	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	a	building	material	.
well	,	that	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	much	 broad 	 er 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	a	scope	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	we	're	looking	at	an	early	sketch	where	i	'm	 understand 	 ing 	 	now	that	the	skin	can	be	a	 transit 	 ion 	 	between	the	ground	and	the	tower	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	building	in	san	francisco	which	is	under	construction	.
and	now	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	much	,	much	 broad 	 er 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	problem	,
and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	with	performance	.
 th 	 is 	 	will	be	the	first	building	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	that	took	--	well	,	i	ca	n't	say	it	took	the	air	 condition 	 ing 	 	out	.	it	's	a	hybrid	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	a	 pur 	 e 	 	thing	,	and	i	ca	n't	get	it	.
it	's	a	wrong	attitude	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	hybrid	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
but	we	took	the	air	 condition 	 ing 	 	out	of	the	tower	.
there	's	some	air	 condition 	 ing 	 	left	in	the	base	,	but	the	skin	now	 move 	 s 	 	on	hydraulics	.
it	 force 	 s 	 	air	through	a	venturi	force	if	there	's	no	wind	.
it	 adjust 	 s 	 	 continu 	 ally 	 	.	and	we	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	the	air	 condition 	 ing 	 	.

and	so	now	what	we	're	looking	at	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	 project 	 s 	 	get	 large 	 r 	 	in	scale	,	 a 	 s 	 	they	 inter 	 face 	 	with	 broad 	 er 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	,	that	they	expand	the	 cap 	 abilities 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	performance	.
well	,	i	could	 al 	 so 	 	start	here	.
we	could	talk	about	the	relationship	at	a	more	 bio 	 logical 	 	sense	of	the	relationship	of	building	and	ground	.
well	,	our	research	--	my	generation	for	 s 	 ure 	 	,	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	school	in	the	late	'60s	--	made	 ver 	 y 	 	much	a	shift	out	of	the	internal	focus	of	 architect 	 ure 	 	,	looking	at	 architect 	 ure 	 	 with 	 in 	 	 it 	 s 	 	own	 territ 	 ory 	 	,	and	we	 we 	 re 	 	much	more	 affect 	 ed 	 	by	film	,	by	what	was	going	on	in	the	art	world	,	etc	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	,	of	course	,	michael	heizer	.
and	when	i	saw	 th 	 is 	 	,	first	an	image	and	then	 visit 	 ed 	 	,	it	 complete 	 ly 	 	 change 	 d 	 	the	way	i	thought	after	that	point	.
and	i	 under 	 stood 	 	that	building	 re 	 ally 	 	could	be	the	 augment 	 ation 	 	of	the	earth	's	surface	,	and	it	 complete 	 ly 	 	 shift 	 ed 	 	the	 not 	 ion 	 	of	building	ground	in	the	most	 bas 	 ic 	 	sense	.
and	then	--	well	,	he	was	 prob 	 ably 	 	looking	at	 th 	 is 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	nazca	;	 th 	 is 	 	is	700	 year 	 s 	 	ago	--	the	most	 amaz 	 ing 	 	four	-	kilometer	land	 sculpt 	 ures 	 	.
they	're	just	 total 	 ly 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	.
and	that	led	us	to	then	 complete 	 ly 	 	 re 	 think 	 ing 	 	how	we	draw	,	how	we	work	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	sketch	of	a	high	school	in	pomona	--
well	,	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	,	a	model	,	a	conceptual	,	kind	of	idea	.
and	it	's	the	 re 	 sha 	 ping 	 	of	the	earth	to	make	it	occupiable	.
so	it	 put 	 s 	 	200,000	square	feet	of	stuff	that	make	a	high	school	work	in	the	surface	of	that	earth	.
there	it	is	 model 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	was	 develop 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	piece	of	work	.
and	there	it	is	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	's	 start 	 ing 	 	to	get	resolved	 tectonic 	 ally 	 	,	and	then	there	's	the	school	.
and	,	of	course	,	we	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 particip 	 ating 	 	with	education	.
i	have	 absolute 	 ly 	 	no	interest	in	producing	a	building	that	just	accommodates	x	,	y	and	z	function	.
what	i	'm	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	are	how	these	 idea 	 s 	 	 particip 	 ate 	 	in	the	 education 	 al 	 	process	of	young	people	.
it	 demand 	 s 	 	some	sort	of	 not 	 ion 	 	of	 inquir 	 y 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	a	system	that	's	 develop 	 ed 	 	not	sculpturally	.
it	's	an	idea	that	 start 	 ed 	 	from	my	first	 discuss 	 ion 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	with	a	broad	,	 consist 	 ent 	 	logic	,	and	that	logic	could	be	 under 	 stood 	 	 a 	 s 	 	one	 occu 	 pies 	 	the	building	.
and	there	's	an	 over 	 t 	 	--	at	 l 	 east 	 	,	there	's	an	attempt	to	make	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 over 	 t 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	of	a	building	that	 connect 	 s 	 	to	the	land	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	way	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 did 	 act 	 ic 	 	approach	to	the	problem	,	 a 	 s 	 	one	would	understand	that	.
and	the	second	project	that	was	just	 finish 	 ed 	 	in	los	angeles	that	uses	some	of	the	same	 idea 	 s 	 	.	it	uses	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	major	idea	.
then	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	the	 head 	 quarter 	 s 	 	for	noaa	--	national	 ocean 	 o 	 graphic 	 	and	 at 	 mo 	 spheric 	 	 age 	 ncy 	 	--	 out 	 side 	 	of	washington	in	maryland	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	they	see	the	world	.
they	have	22	 satellite 	 s 	 	 zip 	 ping 	 	around	at	plus	or	minus	100	 mile 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 s 	 ite 	 	's	in	red	.
and	what	we	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	do	--	well	,	the	 architect 	 s 	 	,	if	there	are	 architect 	 s 	 	out	there	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	laugier	hut	;	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	primitive	hut	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	around	for	so	long	--
and	what	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	is	 re 	 ally 	 	build	 th 	 is 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	see	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 care 	 taker 	 s 	 	of	the	world	,	and	we	 want 	 ed 	 	them	to	look	down	at	 the 	 ir 	 	satellite	,	how	they	see	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 s 	 ite 	 	,	that	eight	-	acre	 s 	 ite 	 	,	and	we	 want 	 ed 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	left	.	we	 want 	 ed 	 	it	to	stay	green	.
there	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	three	 base 	 ball 	 	 field 	 s 	 	on	it	right	now	,	and	they	're	going	to	stay	there	.
we	put	one	piece	 direct 	 ly 	 	north	-	south	,	and	it	 hold 	 s 	 	the	 dish 	 es 	 	at	the	 ear 	 s 	 	,	right	?
and	then	right	 be 	 low 	 	that	the	 process 	 ing 	 	,	and	the	mission	lift	,	and	the	mission	control	room	,	and	all	the	other	 space 	 s 	 	are	 under 	 ground 	 	.
and	what	you	look	at	is	an	 air 	 craft 	 	 car 	 rier 	 	that	's	performance	-	driven	by	the	 con 	 e 	 	vision	of	these	satellite	 dish 	 es 	 	.
and	that	the	building	 it 	 self 	 	is	occupied	in	the	lower	 port 	 ion 	 	,	broken	up	by	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 court 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	five	 acre 	 s 	 	of	 un 	 interrupt 	 ed 	 	,	 horizon 	 tal 	 	space	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 administr 	 ative 	 	 off 	 ice 	 s 	 	.
and	then	that	,	in	turn	,	 propel 	 led 	 	us	to	look	at	 large 	 r 	 	-	scale	 project 	 s 	 	where	 th 	 is 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	of	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	building	 inter 	 face 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	 connect 	 ive 	 	tissue	.
the	new	capital	 com 	 petition 	 	for	berlin	,	four	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	we	just	 finish 	 ed 	 	the	ecb	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	 co 	 op 	 	himmelblau	in	vienna	just	won	 th 	 is 	 	project	,	where	the	building	was	 separat 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	 element 	 s 	 	that	 be 	 came 	 	part	of	a	 connect 	 ive 	 	tissue	of	a	park	,	which	is	parallel	to	the	river	,	and	 develop 	 s 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	of	the	 building 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	part	of	the	 connect 	 ive 	 	fabric	--	the	social	,	cultural	and	the	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	,	 re 	 creation 	 al 	 	fabric	of	the	city	.
and	the	building	is	no	 long 	 er 	 	 s 	 een 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	autonomous	thing	,	but	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	 on 	 ly 	 	inextricably	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	city	and	 th 	 is 	 	place	at	 th 	 is 	 	time	.	and	a	project	that	was	 real 	 ized 	 	in	austria	,	the	hooper	bank	,	which	 aga 	 in 	 	used	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	 connect 	 ing 	 	 typo 	 logy 	 	,	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	 building 	 s 	 	,	and	 morpho 	 logy 	 	,	or	the	relationship	of	the	 develop 	 ment 	 	of	land	 a 	 s 	 	an	idea	,	 in 	 to 	 	a	complex	,	which	is	a	piece	of	a	city	where	we	can	see	part	of	it	is	 liter 	 ally 	 	just	 th 	 is 	 	 augment 	 ing 	 	,
 th 	 is 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	of	the	land	that	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	idea	of	just	 lift 	 ing 	 	it	up	and	 occupy 	 ing 	 	it	,	and	other	 part 	 s 	 	are	much	more	 energ 	 etic 	 	and	 intens 	 e 	 	.
and	talk	about	that	 intens 	 ity 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	 collision 	 s 	 	of	the	kind	of	 event 	 s 	 	they	make	that	have	to	do	with	 put 	 ting 	 	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 system 	 s 	 	together	,	and	then	where	part	of	it	is	in	the	ground	,	part	of	it	is	oppositional	 lift 	 s 	 	.
one	 enter 	 s 	 	the	building	 a 	 s 	 	it	 lift 	 s 	 	off	the	ground	,	and	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	part	of	the	idea	.
and	then	the	skin	--	the	 edge 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	--	all	promote	the	dynamic	,	the	 move 	 ment 	 	of	the	building	 a 	 s 	 	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 s 	 e 	 ism 	 ic 	 	 shift 	 s 	 	,	 geo 	 logic 	 	 shift 	 s 	 	.	right	?
and	it	 make 	 s 	 	for	event	space	and	then	it	 break 	 s 	 	in	 place 	 s 	 	that	allow	you	to	peer	 in 	 to 	 	the	 in 	 terior 	 	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	 in 	 terior 	 s 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	are	promoting	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	for	the	 work 	 place 	 	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	 continu 	 al 	 	interest	of	 our 	 s 	 	.
and	then	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	in	a	more	,	kind	of	 tradition 	 al 	 	setting	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	graduate	student	housing	in	toronto	,	and	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	much	about	the	relationship	of	a	building	 a 	 s 	 	it	 make 	 s 	 	a	 connect 	 ive 	 	tissue	to	the	city	.
the	main	idea	was	the	 gate 	 way 	 	,	where	it	 break 	 s 	 	the	 s 	 ite 	 	,	and	the	building	 occu 	 pies 	 	both	the	public	space	and	the	private	space	.
and	it	's	that	 territ 	 ory 	 	of	--	it	's	 th 	 is 	 	thing	.
i	 visit 	 ed 	 	the	 s 	 ite 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	,	and	 every 	 body 	 	,	kind	of	--	you	can	see	 th 	 is 	 	from	two	 kilometer 	 s 	 	away	;	it	's	an	exact	center	of	the	street	,	and	the	whole	 not 	 ion 	 	is	to	engage	the	public	,	to	engage	 building 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	the	public	tissue	of	the	city	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	one	of	the	most	 interest 	 ing 	 	 project 	 s 	 	--	it	's	a	 court 	 house 	 	.
and	what	i	want	to	talk	about	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 suprem 	 e 	 	court	,	of	course	--	and	,	well	,	i	'm	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	michael	hogan	,	the	chief	justice	of	oregon	.
you	could	not	proceed	 with 	 out 	 	making	 th 	 is 	 	 negoti 	 ation 	 	between	one	's	own	 value 	 s 	 	and	the	relationship	of	the	character	you	're	 work 	 ing 	 	with	and	how	he	 understand 	 s 	 	the	court	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	 show 	 ing 	 	him	,	of	course	,	corbusier	at	savoy	,	which	is	1928	,	which	is	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	modern	 architect 	 ure 	 	.
well	,	then	we	get	to	 th 	 is 	 	image	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	the	project	 start 	 ed 	 	.	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	going	,	i	'm	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	 phenomen 	 on 	 	that	's	taking	place	in	here	.
and	 re 	 ally 	 	what	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	is	 construct 	 ing 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	.
and	i	'm	a	character	that	's	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 understand 	 ing 	 	the	nature	of	that	 construct 	 ed 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	no	 s 	 uch 	 	thing	 a 	 s 	 	nature	any	more	.	nature	is	gone	.
nature	in	the	19th	-	century	sense	,	 al 	 right 	 	?
nature	is	 on 	 ly 	 	a	cultural	edifice	 to 	 day 	 	,	right	?
we	construct	it	and	we	construct	 t 	 hose 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	.
and	then	of	course	,	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	our	 govern 	 or 	 	at	the	moment	.
and	we	 s 	 pent 	 	some	time	with	conan	,	 believ 	 e 	 	it	or	not	,	and	then	that	led	us	to	,	kind	of	,	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	of	our	 world 	 s 	 	from	a	legal	and	an	 art 	 istic 	 	,	 architect 	 ural 	 	.
and	it	 force 	 d 	 	us	to	talk	about	 not 	 ions 	 	of	how	we	work	,	and	the	 dynamic 	 s 	 	of	that	,	and	what	other	 source 	 s 	 	of	the	work	is	.
and	it	led	us	to	the	project	,	the	 court 	 house 	 	,	which	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	a	part	of	a	 negoti 	 ation 	 	between	tradition	and	 piece 	 s 	 	of	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	 court 	 house 	 	.
you	'll	find	a	stair	that	's	the	same	length	 a 	 s 	 	the	 suprem 	 e 	 	court	.
here	's	a	piano	nobile	,	which	is	a	 de 	 vice 	 	used	in	the	 ren 	 aiss 	 ance 	 	.
the	 court 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	made	of	that	.	the	skin	is	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 layer 	 s 	 
that	reflect	even	rusticated	stonework	,	but	which	 we 	 re 	 	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	with	 fragment 	 s 	 	of	the	 constit 	 ution 	 	,	which	 we 	 re 	 	part	of	the	little	process	,	all	set	on	a	plinth	that	defined	it	from	the	community	.
thank	you	so	much	.
