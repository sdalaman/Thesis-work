billy	collins	:	i	'm	here	to	give	you	your	 recommend 	 ed 	 	 diet 	 ary 	 	 allow 	 ance 	 	of	 poet 	 ry 	 	.
and	the	way	i	'm	going	to	do	that	is	present	to	you	five	 anim 	 ations 	 	of	five	of	my	 poem 	 s 	 	.
and	let	me	just	tell	you	a	little	bit	of	how	that	came	about	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	 mix 	 ing 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	two	media	is	a	sort	of	 un 	 natural 	 	or	 un 	 necess 	 ary 	 	act	.
but	when	i	was	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	poet	laureate	--	and	i	love	 say 	 ing 	 	that	.
it	's	a	great	way	to	start	 sentence 	 s 	 	.
when	i	was	him	back	then	,	i	was	 approach 	 ed 	 	by	j.	walter	thompson	,	the	ad	company	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 hire 	 d 	 	sort	of	by	the	sundance	channel	.
and	the	idea	was	to	have	me	record	some	of	my	 poem 	 s 	 	and	then	they	would	find	 anim 	 ators 	 	to	animate	them	.
and	i	was	 initi 	 ally 	 	resistant	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 al 	 ways 	 	think	 poet 	 ry 	 	can	stand	 al 	 one 	 	by	 it 	 self 	 	.
 attempt 	 s 	 	to	put	my	 poem 	 s 	 	to	music	have	had	 dis 	 astro 	 us 	 	 result 	 s 	 	,	in	all	 case 	 s 	 	.
and	the	poem	,	if	it	's	written	with	the	ear	,	 al 	 ready 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	set	to	 it 	 s 	 	own	verbal	music	 a 	 s 	 	it	was	 compose 	 d 	 	.
and	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	,	if	you	're	 read 	 ing 	 	a	poem	that	 ment 	 ions 	 	a	cow	,	you	do	n't	need	on	the	facing	page	a	 draw 	 ing 	 	of	a	cow	.
i	mean	,	let	's	let	the	 read 	 er 	 	do	a	little	work	.
but	i	 relent 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 seem 	 ed 	 	like	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	 possibil 	 ity 	 	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	i	'm	like	a	total	cartoon	 junk 	 ie 	 	since	 child 	 hood 	 	.
i	think	more	 in 	 fluent 	 ial 	 	than	emily	dickinson	or	coleridge	or	wordsworth	on	my	 imagin 	 ation 	 	 we 	 re 	 	warner	 brother 	 s 	 	,	merrie	 melo 	 dies 	 	and	 loo 	 ny 	 	 tune 	 s 	 	 cartoon 	 s 	 	.
 bug 	 s 	 	 bun 	 ny 	 	is	my	muse	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	way	 poet 	 ry 	 	could	find	 it 	 s 	 	way	onto	 tele 	 vision 	 	of	all	 place 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'm	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	all	for	 poet 	 ry 	 	in	public	 place 	 s 	 	--	 poet 	 ry 	 	on	 bus 	 es 	 	,	 poet 	 ry 	 	on	 sub 	 ways 	 	,	on	 bill 	 board 	 s 	 	,	on	 ce 	 real 	 	boxes	.
when	i	was	poet	laureate	,	there	i	go	 aga 	 in 	 	--	i	ca	n't	help	it	,	it	's	true	--	i	 create 	 d 	 	a	 poet 	 ry 	 	channel	on	 del 	 ta 	 	 air 	 lines 	 	that	 last 	 ed 	 	for	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
so	you	could	tune	 in 	 to 	 	 poet 	 ry 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	 we 	 re 	 	 fly 	 ing 	 	.
and	my	sense	is	,	it	's	a	good	thing	to	get	 poet 	 ry 	 	off	the	 shelv 	 es 	 	and	more	 in 	 to 	 	public	life	.
start	a	 meet 	 ing 	 	with	a	poem	.	that	would	be	an	idea	you	might	take	with	you	.
when	you	get	a	poem	on	a	 bill 	 board 	 	or	on	the	radio	or	on	a	 ce 	 real 	 	box	or	 what 	 ever 	 	,	it	 happen 	 s 	 	to	you	so	 sudden 	 ly 	 	that	you	do	n't	have	time	to	deploy	your	anti	-	 poet 	 ry 	 	 deflect 	 or 	 	 shield 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 install 	 ed 	 	in	high	school	.
so	let	us	start	with	the	first	one	.
it	's	a	little	poem	 call 	 ed 	 	``	budapest	,	``	and	in	it	i	reveal	,	or	pretend	to	reveal	,	the	 secret 	 s 	 	of	the	creative	process	.
