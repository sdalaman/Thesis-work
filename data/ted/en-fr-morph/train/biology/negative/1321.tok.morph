 among 	 st 	 	all	the	 trou 	 bling 	 	 defici 	 ts 	 	we	struggle	with	 to 	 day 	 	--	we	think	of	financial	and	economic	 prim 	 arily 	 	--	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	concern	me	most	is	the	 defici 	 t 	 	of	 politic 	 al 	 	 dial 	 ogue 	 	--	our	ability	to	address	modern	 conflict 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	are	,	to	go	to	the	source	of	what	they	're	all	about	and	to	understand	the	key	 player 	 s 	 	and	to	deal	with	them	.
we	who	are	 diplomat 	 s 	 	,	we	are	trained	to	deal	with	 conflict 	 s 	 	between	 state 	 s 	 	and	 issue 	 s 	 	between	 state 	 s 	 	.
and	i	can	tell	you	,	our	agenda	is	full	.
there	is	trade	,	there	is	 dis 	 armament 	 	,	there	is	cross	-	border	 relation 	 s 	 	.
but	the	picture	is	changing	,	and	we	are	 see 	 ing 	 	that	there	are	new	key	 player 	 s 	 	coming	onto	the	scene	.
we	 loose 	 ly 	 	call	them	``	 group 	 s 	 	.	``
they	may	represent	social	,	religious	,	 politic 	 al 	 	,	economic	,	 militar 	 y 	 	 real 	 ities 	 	.
and	we	struggle	with	how	to	deal	with	them	.
the	 rule 	 s 	 	of	 engage 	 ment 	 	:	how	to	talk	,	when	to	talk	,	and	how	to	deal	with	them	.
let	me	show	you	a	slide	here	which	 illustr 	 ates 	 	the	character	of	 conflict 	 s 	 	since	1946	 un 	 til 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
you	see	the	green	is	a	 tradition 	 al 	 	 inter 	 state 	 	conflict	,	the	 one 	 s 	 	we	used	to	read	about	.
the	red	is	modern	conflict	,	 conflict 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
these	are	 quit 	 e 	 	different	,	and	they	are	 out 	 side 	 	the	grasp	of	modern	 diploma 	 cy 	 	.
and	the	core	of	these	key	 act 	 ors 	 	are	 group 	 s 	 	who	represent	different	 interest 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	.
and	the	way	they	deal	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 conflict 	 s 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	 spread 	 s 	 	to	other	 count 	 ries 	 	.
so	in	a	way	,	it	is	 every 	 body 	 	's	business	.
 an 	 other 	 	 acknowledg 	 ment 	 	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	these	 year 	 s 	 	,	 re 	 cent 	 	 year 	 s 	 	,	is	that	 ver 	 y 	 	few	of	these	domestic	 inter 	 state 	 	,	 intra 	 state 	 	 conflict 	 s 	 	can	be	 solve 	 d 	 	 militar 	 ily 	 	.
they	may	have	to	be	 deal 	 t 	 	with	with	 militar 	 y 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	,	but	they	can	not	be	 solve 	 d 	 	by	 militar 	 y 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	.
they	need	 politic 	 al 	 	 solution 	 s 	 	.
and	we	,	 there 	 fore 	 	,	have	a	problem	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 es 	 cape 	 	 tradition 	 al 	 	 diploma 	 cy 	 	.
and	we	have	among	 state 	 s 	 	a	 reluct 	 ance 	 	in	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	them	.
plus	,	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	last	decade	,	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	in	the	mode	where	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	 group 	 s 	 	was	 conceptual 	 ly 	 	and	 politic 	 ally 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
after	9/11	,	either	you	 we 	 re 	 	with	us	or	against	us	.
it	was	black	or	white	.
and	 group 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	often	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	label	 terrorist 	 s 	 	.
and	who	would	talk	to	 terrorist 	 s 	 	?
the	west	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	would	see	it	,	 come 	 s 	 	out	of	that	decade	 weak 	 ened 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	did	n't	understand	the	group	.
so	we	've	 s 	 pent 	 	more	time	on	 focus 	 ing 	 	on	why	we	should	not	talk	to	 other 	 s 	 	than	 find 	 ing 	 	out	how	we	talk	to	 other 	 s 	 	.
now	i	'm	not	naive	.
you	can	not	talk	to	 every 	 body 	 	all	the	time	.
and	there	are	 time 	 s 	 	you	should	walk	.
and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 militar 	 y 	 	intervention	is	 necess 	 ary 	 	.
i	happen	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	libya	was	 necess 	 ary 	 	and	that	 militar 	 y 	 	intervention	in	afghanistan	was	 al 	 so 	 	 necess 	 ary 	 	.
and	my	country	 re 	 lies 	 	on	 it 	 s 	 	security	through	 militar 	 y 	 	alliance	,	that	's	clear	.
but	still	we	have	a	large	 defici 	 t 	 	in	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	and	 understand 	 ing 	 	modern	conflict	.
let	us	turn	to	afghanistan	.
10	 year 	 s 	 	after	that	 militar 	 y 	 	intervention	,	that	country	is	far	from	secure	.
the	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	to	be	honest	,	is	 ver 	 y 	 	serious	.
now	 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	 militar 	 y 	 	is	 necess 	 ary 	 	,	but	the	 militar 	 y 	 	is	no	problem	-	 solve 	 r 	 	.
when	i	first	came	to	afghanistan	in	2005	 a 	 s 	 	a	foreign	 mini 	 ster 	 	,	i	met	the	 command 	 er 	 	of	isaf	,	the	 inter 	 national 	 	 troop 	 s 	 	.
and	he	told	me	that	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	can	be	won	 militar 	 ily 	 	,	 mini 	 ster 	 	.
we	just	have	to	 persever 	 e 	 	.	``	now	four	com	isaf	's	 lat 	 er 	 	,	we	hear	a	different	 mess 	 age 	 	:	``	 th 	 is 	 	can	not	be	won	 militar 	 ily 	 	.
we	need	 militar 	 y 	 	presence	,	but	we	need	to	move	to	 politic 	 s 	 	.
we	can	 on 	 ly 	 	solve	 th 	 is 	 	through	a	 politic 	 al 	 	solution	.
and	it	is	not	us	who	will	solve	it	;	afghans	have	to	solve	it	.	``	but	then	they	need	a	different	 politic 	 al 	 	process	than	the	one	they	 we 	 re 	 	 give 	 n 	 	in	2001	,	2002	.
they	need	an	inclusive	process	where	the	real	fabric	of	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	can	deal	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	.
 every 	 body 	 	 seem 	 s 	 	to	agree	with	that	.
it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	controversial	to	say	three	,	four	,	five	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
now	 every 	 body 	 	 agree 	 s 	 	.
but	now	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	 prep 	 are 	 	to	talk	,	we	understand	how	little	we	know	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	did	n't	talk	.
we	did	n't	grasp	what	was	going	on	.
the	 inter 	 national 	 	 commit 	 tee 	 	of	the	red	cross	,	the	icrc	,	is	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	 every 	 one 	 	,	and	it	is	 do 	 ing 	 	so	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	neutral	.
and	that	's	one	reason	why	that	 organ 	 ization 	 	 prob 	 ably 	 	is	the	best	 inform 	 ed 	 	key	player	to	understand	modern	conflict	--	 be 	 cause 	 	they	talk	.
my	point	is	that	you	do	n't	have	to	be	neutral	to	talk	.
and	you	do	n't	have	to	agree	when	you	 s 	 it 	 	down	with	the	other	side	.
and	you	can	 al 	 ways 	 	walk	.
but	if	you	do	n't	talk	,	you	ca	n't	engage	the	other	side	.
and	the	other	side	which	you	're	going	to	engage	is	the	one	with	whom	you	 pro 	 found 	 ly 	 	disagree	.
prime	 mini 	 ster 	 	rabin	 s 	 aid 	 	when	he	 engag 	 ed 	 	the	oslo	process	,	``	you	do	n't	make	peace	with	your	 friend 	 s 	 	,	you	make	peace	with	your	 ene 	 mies 	 	.	``	it	's	hard	,	but	it	is	 necess 	 ary 	 	.
let	me	go	one	step	further	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	tahrir	square	.	there	's	a	revolution	going	on	.
the	arab	spring	is	 head 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	fall	and	is	moving	 in 	 to 	 	winter	.
it	will	last	for	a	long	,	long	time	.
and	who	 know 	 s 	 	what	it	will	be	 call 	 ed 	 	in	the	end	.
that	's	not	the	point	.
the	point	is	that	we	are	 prob 	 ably 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	,	for	the	first	time	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	the	arab	world	,	a	revolution	bottom	-	up	--	people	's	revolution	.	social	 group 	 s 	 	are	taking	to	the	 street 	 s 	 	.
and	we	find	out	in	the	west	that	we	know	 ver 	 y 	 	little	about	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	never	talk	to	the	people	in	these	 count 	 ries 	 	.
most	 government 	 s 	 	 follow 	 ed 	 	the	 dict 	 ate 	 	of	the	 author 	 itarian 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	to	stay	away	from	these	different	 group 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 terrorist 	 s 	 	.
so	now	that	they	are	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	in	the	street	and	we	 salut 	 e 	 	the	 democrat 	 ic 	 	revolution	,	we	find	out	how	little	we	know	.
right	now	,	the	 discuss 	 ion 	 	 go 	 es 	 	,	``	should	we	talk	to	the	muslim	brotherhood	?
should	we	talk	to	hamas	?
if	we	talk	to	them	,	we	may	legitimize	them	.	``	i	think	that	is	wrong	.
if	you	talk	in	the	right	way	,	you	make	it	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	that	 talk 	 ing 	 	is	not	 agree 	 ing 	 	.
and	how	can	we	tell	the	muslim	brotherhood	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	should	,	that	they	must	respect	 minor 	 ity 	 	 right 	 s 	 	,	if	we	do	n't	accept	 major 	 ity 	 	 right 	 s 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	they	may	turn	out	to	be	a	 major 	 ity 	 	.
how	can	we	 es 	 cape 	 	[	 hav 	 ing 	 	]	a	double	-	standard	,	if	we	at	the	same	time	preach	 demo 	 cracy 	 	and	at	the	same	time	do	n't	want	to	deal	with	the	 group 	 s 	 	that	are	 represent 	 ative 	 	?
how	will	we	ever	be	 inter 	 locu 	 tors 	 	?
now	my	 diplomat 	 s 	 	are	 instruct 	 ed 	 	to	talk	to	all	these	 group 	 s 	 	.
but	 talk 	 ing 	 	can	be	 d 	 one 	 	in	different	ways	.
we	make	a	 distinct 	 ion 	 	between	 talk 	 ing 	 	from	a	 diplomat 	 ic 	 	level	and	 talk 	 ing 	 	at	the	 politic 	 al 	 	level	.
now	 talk 	 ing 	 	can	be	 accompani 	 ed 	 	with	aid	or	not	with	aid	.
 talk 	 ing 	 	can	be	 accompani 	 ed 	 	with	 in 	 clusion 	 	or	not	 in 	 clusion 	 	.
there	's	a	big	array	of	the	ways	of	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	if	we	 re 	 fuse 	 	to	talk	to	these	new	 group 	 s 	 	that	are	going	to	be	 domin 	 ating 	 	the	news	in	 year 	 s 	 	to	come	,	we	will	further	 radical 	 ization 	 	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	.
we	will	make	the	road	from	violent	 activ 	 ities 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 politic 	 s 	 	 hard 	 er 	 	to	travel	.
and	if	we	can	not	 demonst 	 rate 	 	to	these	 group 	 s 	 	that	if	you	move	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 demo 	 cracy 	 	,	if	you	move	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	taking	part	in	 civil 	 ized 	 	and	normal	 standard 	 s 	 	among	 state 	 s 	 	,	there	are	some	 reward 	 s 	 	on	the	other	side	.
the	paradox	here	is	that	the	last	decade	 prob 	 ably 	 	was	a	lost	decade	for	making	progress	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	the	paradox	is	that	the	decade	before	the	last	decade	was	so	promising	--	and	for	one	reason	 prim 	 arily 	 	.
and	the	reason	is	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	south	africa	:	nelson	mandela	.
when	mandela	came	out	of	 pri 	 son 	 	after	27	 year 	 s 	 	of	 captiv 	 ity 	 	,	if	he	had	told	his	people	,	``	it	's	time	to	take	up	the	 arm 	 s 	 	,	it	's	time	to	fight	,	``	he	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	 follow 	 ed 	 	.
and	i	think	the	 inter 	 national 	 	community	would	have	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	fair	 en 	 ough 	 	.
it	's	 the 	 ir 	 	right	to	fight	.	``	now	 a 	 s 	 	you	know	,	mandela	did	n't	do	that	.
in	his	 memoir 	 s 	 	,	``	long	road	to	 free 	 dom 	 	,	``	he	wrote	that	he	 surviv 	 ed 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 year 	 s 	 	of	 captiv 	 ity 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 al 	 ways 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	to	look	 up 	 on 	 	his	 oppress 	 or 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	a	human	 be 	 ing 	 	,	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	a	human	 be 	 ing 	 	.	so	he	 engag 	 ed 	 	a	 politic 	 al 	 	process	of	 dial 	 ogue 	 	,	not	 a 	 s 	 	a	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	of	the	weak	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	a	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	of	the	strong	.
and	he	 engag 	 ed 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	 pro 	 found 	 ly 	 	by	 settl 	 ing 	 	some	of	the	most	 trick 	 y 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	through	a	truth	and	 reconcili 	 ation 	 	process	where	people	came	and	 talk 	 ed 	 	.
now	south	african	 friend 	 s 	 	will	know	that	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 pain 	 ful 	 	.
so	what	can	we	learn	from	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	?
 dial 	 ogue 	 	is	not	easy	--	not	between	 individual 	 s 	 	,	not	between	 group 	 s 	 	,	not	between	 government 	 s 	 	--	but	it	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 necess 	 ary 	 	.
if	we	're	going	to	deal	with	 politic 	 al 	 	conflict	-	solving	of	 conflict 	 s 	 	,	if	we	're	going	to	understand	these	new	 group 	 s 	 	which	are	coming	from	bottom	-	up	,	 support 	 ed 	 	by	technology	,	which	is	 avail 	 able 	 	to	all	,	we	 diplomat 	 s 	 	can	not	be	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	back	in	the	 banquet 	 s 	 	 believ 	 ing 	 	that	we	are	 do 	 ing 	 	 inter 	 state 	 	 relation 	 s 	 	.	we	have	to	connect	with	these	 pro 	 found 	 	 change 	 s 	 	.
and	what	is	 dial 	 ogue 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	about	?
when	i	enter	 in 	 to 	 	 dial 	 ogue 	 	,	i	 re 	 ally 	 	hope	that	the	other	side	would	pick	up	my	 point 	 s 	 	of	view	,	that	i	would	impress	 up 	 on 	 	them	my	 opinion 	 s 	 	and	my	 value 	 s 	 	.
i	can	not	do	that	 un 	 less 	 	i	 s 	 end 	 	the	 signal 	 s 	 	that	i	will	be	open	to	listen	to	the	other	side	's	 signal 	 s 	 	.
we	need	a	lot	more	training	on	how	to	do	that	and	a	lot	more	practice	on	how	that	can	take	problem	-	solving	forward	.
we	know	from	our	personal	 experience 	 s 	 	that	it	's	easy	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	just	to	walk	,	and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	you	may	need	to	fight	.
and	i	would	n't	say	that	is	the	wrong	thing	in	all	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	you	have	to	.
but	that	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	seldom	 take 	 s 	 	you	 ver 	 y 	 	far	.
the	 alter 	 native 	 	is	a	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	of	 engage 	 ment 	 	and	 principle 	 d 	 	 dial 	 ogue 	 	.
and	i	 believ 	 e 	 	we	need	to	 strength 	 en 	 	 th 	 is 	 	approach	in	modern	 diploma 	 cy 	 	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	between	 state 	 s 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 with 	 in 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
we	are	 see 	 ing 	 	some	new	 sign 	 s 	 	.
we	could	never	have	 d 	 one 	 	the	convention	against	anti	-	 person 	 nel 	 	 land 	 mine 	 s 	 	and	the	convention	that	is	 bann 	 ing 	 	cluster	 mun 	 ition 	 s 	 	 un 	 less 	 	we	had	 d 	 one 	 	 diploma 	 cy 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	,	by	 engag 	 ing 	 	with	civil	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
all	of	a	sudden	,	ngos	 we 	 re 	 	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 stand 	 ing 	 	in	the	 street 	 s 	 	,	 cry 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 slogan 	 s 	 	,	but	they	 we 	 re 	 	taking	[	them	]	 in 	 to 	 	the	 negoti 	 ations 	 	,	 part 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 represent 	 ed 	 	the	 victim 	 s 	 	of	these	 weapon 	 s 	 	.
and	they	 br 	 ought 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	knowledge	.
and	there	was	an	 interact 	 ion 	 	between	 diploma 	 cy 	 	and	the	power	coming	bottom	-	up	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	a	first	element	of	a	change	.
in	the	future	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	we	should	draw	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	from	these	different	 illustr 	 ations 	 	,	not	to	have	 diploma 	 cy 	 	which	is	 dis 	 connect 	 ed 	 	from	people	and	civil	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
and	we	have	to	go	 al 	 so 	 	beyond	 tradition 	 al 	 	 diploma 	 cy 	 	to	the	 surviv 	 al 	 	issue	of	our	 time 	 s 	 	,	climate	change	.
how	are	we	going	to	solve	climate	change	through	 negoti 	 ations 	 	,	 un 	 less 	 	we	are	able	to	make	civil	 socie 	 ty 	 	and	people	,	not	part	of	the	problem	,	but	part	of	the	solution	?
it	is	going	to	demand	an	inclusive	process	of	 diploma 	 cy 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	different	from	the	one	we	are	 p 	 rac 	 tic 	 ing 	 	 to 	 day 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	are	 head 	 ing 	 	to	new	 round 	 s 	 	of	difficult	climate	 negoti 	 ations 	 	,	but	when	we	move	 to 	 ward 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	which	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	much	more	 a 	 long 	 	a	broad	 mobil 	 ization 	 	.
it	's	 cruci 	 al 	 	to	understand	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	technology	and	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 global 	 ization 	 	,	 socie 	 ties 	 	from	bottom	-	up	.
we	 a 	 s 	 	 diplomat 	 s 	 	need	to	know	the	social	capital	of	 commun 	 ities 	 	.
what	is	it	that	 make 	 s 	 	people	trust	each	other	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	between	 state 	 s 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 with 	 in 	 	 state 	 s 	 	?
what	is	the	 leg 	 i 	 timacy 	 	of	 diploma 	 cy 	 	,	of	the	the	solution	we	 dev 	 ise 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 diplomat 	 s 	 	if	they	can	not	be	 reflect 	 ed 	 	and	 under 	 stood 	 	by	 al 	 so 	 	these	 broad 	 er 	 	 force 	 s 	 	of	 socie 	 ties 	 	that	we	now	 ver 	 y 	 	 loose 	 ly 	 	call	 group 	 s 	 	?
the	good	thing	is	that	we	are	not	 power 	 less 	 	.
we	have	never	had	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	of	communication	,	 mean 	 s 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	,	 mean 	 s 	 	of	 reach 	 ing 	 	out	,	 mean 	 s 	 	of	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	.
the	 diplomat 	 ic 	 	 tool 	 box 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	full	of	different	 tool 	 s 	 	we	can	use	to	 strength 	 en 	 	our	communication	.
but	the	problem	is	that	we	are	coming	out	of	a	decade	where	we	had	a	fear	of	 touch 	 ing 	 	it	.
now	,	i	hope	,	in	the	coming	 year 	 s 	 	,	that	we	are	able	to	 demonst 	 rate 	 	through	some	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	that	fear	is	 reced 	 ing 	 	and	that	we	can	take	courage	from	that	alliance	with	civil	 socie 	 ty 	 	in	different	 count 	 ries 	 	to	support	 the 	 ir 	 	problem	-	solving	,	among	the	afghans	,	 in 	 side 	 	the	palestinian	population	,	between	the	 people 	 s 	 	of	palestine	and	israel	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	we	try	to	understand	 th 	 is 	 	broad	 move 	 ment 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	arab	world	,	we	are	not	 power 	 less 	 	.
we	need	to	improve	the	 necess 	 ary 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	,	and	we	need	the	courage	to	use	them	.
in	my	country	,	i	have	 s 	 een 	 	how	the	council	of	islamist	 group 	 s 	 	and	christian	 group 	 s 	 	came	together	,	not	 a 	 s 	 	a	government	 initi 	 ative 	 	,	but	they	came	together	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 initi 	 ative 	 	to	establish	contact	and	 dial 	 ogue 	 	in	 time 	 s 	 	where	 thing 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	low	-	key	tension	.
and	when	tension	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	,	they	 al 	 ready 	 	had	that	 dial 	 ogue 	 	,	and	that	was	a	strength	to	deal	with	different	 issue 	 s 	 	.
our	modern	western	 socie 	 ties 	 	are	more	complex	than	before	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	time	of	 migr 	 ation 	 	.
how	are	we	going	to	settle	and	build	a	 big 	 ger 	 	``	we	``	to	deal	with	our	 issue 	 s 	 	if	we	do	n't	improve	our	 skill 	 s 	 	of	communication	?
so	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	,	and	for	all	of	these	 reason 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	time	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	why	we	must	talk	.
thank	you	for	your	attention	.
