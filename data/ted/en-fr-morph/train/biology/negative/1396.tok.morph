one	out	of	two	of	you	women	will	be	 impact 	 ed 	 	by	 cardio 	 vascular 	 	disease	in	your	 life 	 time 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 lead 	 ing 	 	killer	of	women	.
it	's	a	 close 	 ly 	 	held	secret	for	 reason 	 s 	 	i	do	n't	know	.
in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	making	 th 	 is 	 	personal	--	so	we	're	going	to	talk	about	your	relationship	with	your	heart	and	all	women	's	relationship	with	 the 	 ir 	 	heart	--	we	're	going	to	wax	 in 	 to 	 	the	 politic 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	personal	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	know	,	is	 politic 	 al 	 	.
and	not	 en 	 ough 	 	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	we	have	 watch 	 ed 	 	women	conquer	breast	cancer	through	the	breast	cancer	campaign	,
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	need	to	do	now	with	heart	.
since	1984	,	more	women	die	in	the	u.s.	than	men	.
so	where	we	used	to	think	of	heart	disease	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	a	man	's	problem	 prim 	 arily 	 	--
which	that	was	never	true	,	but	that	was	kind	of	how	 every 	 body 	 	thought	in	the	1950s	and	'60s	,
and	it	was	in	all	the	 text 	 book 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 certain 	 ly 	 	what	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	when	i	was	training	.
if	we	 we 	 re 	 	to	remain	 s 	 exist 	 	,	and	that	was	not	right	,	but	if	we	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	go	forward	and	be	 s 	 exist 	 	,	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	woman	's	disease	.
so	it	's	a	woman	's	disease	now	.
and	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	see	is	that	male	line	,	the	 mortal 	 ity 	 	is	going	down	,	down	,	down	,	down	,	down	.
and	you	see	the	female	line	since	1984	,	the	gap	is	 widen 	 ing 	 	.
more	and	more	women	,	two	,	three	,	four	 time 	 s 	 	more	women	,	 dy 	 ing 	 	of	heart	disease	than	men	.
and	that	's	too	short	of	a	time	period	for	all	the	different	risk	 factor 	 s 	 	that	we	know	to	change	.
at	the	national	level	was	that	 diagnos 	 tic 	 	and	therapeutic	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	,	which	had	 be 	 en 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	in	men	,	by	men	,	for	men	for	the	last	50	 year 	 s 	 	--	and	they	work	 pre 	 tty 	 	well	in	men	,	do	n't	they	?	--	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 work 	 ing 	 	so	well	for	women	.
so	that	was	a	big	wake	-	up	call	in	the	1980	's	.
heart	disease	 kill 	 s 	 	more	women	at	all	 age 	 s 	 	than	breast	cancer	.
and	the	breast	cancer	campaign	--	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	 com 	 petition 	 	.
we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	be	 a 	 s 	 	good	 a 	 s 	 	the	breast	cancer	campaign	.
we	need	to	be	 a 	 s 	 	good	 a 	 s 	 	the	breast	cancer	campaign	to	address	 th 	 is 	 	crisis	.
now	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	when	people	see	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	hear	 th 	 is 	 	gasp	.
we	can	all	think	of	 some 	 one 	 	,	often	a	young	woman	,	who	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 impact 	 ed 	 	by	breast	cancer	.
we	often	ca	n't	think	of	a	young	woman	who	 ha 	 s 	 	heart	disease	.
i	'm	going	to	tell	you	why	.
heart	disease	 kill 	 s 	 	people	,	often	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
so	the	first	time	heart	disease	 strike 	 s 	 	in	women	and	men	,	half	of	the	time	it	's	sudden	cardiac	death	--
no	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	say	good	-	bye	,	no	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	take	her	to	the	 chemo 	 therapy 	 	,	no	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	help	her	pick	out	a	wig	.
breast	cancer	,	 mortal 	 ity 	 	is	down	to	four	percent	.
and	that	is	the	40	 year 	 s 	 	that	women	have	 advoc 	 ated 	 	.
betty	ford	,	nancy	reagan	stood	up	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'm	a	breast	cancer	 surviv 	 or 	 	,	``	and	it	was	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	to	talk	about	it	.
and	then	 physician 	 s 	 	have	gone	to	bat	.
we	've	 d 	 one 	 	the	research	.
we	have	effective	 ther 	 a 	 pies 	 	now	.
women	are	living	 long 	 er 	 	than	ever	.	that	 ha 	 s 	 	to	happen	in	heart	disease	,	and	it	's	time	.	it	's	not	 happen 	 ing 	 	,	and	it	's	time	.
we	owe	an	 in 	 credible 	 	debt	of	 grat 	 itude 	 	to	these	two	women	.
 a 	 s 	 	barbara	 depict 	 ed 	 	in	one	of	her	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 movie 	 s 	 	,	``	yentl	,	``
she	 port 	 ray 	 ed 	 	a	young	woman	who	 want 	 ed 	 	an	education	.
and	she	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 stud 	 y 	 	the	talmud	.
and	so	how	did	she	get	educated	then	?
she	had	to	 imperson 	 ate 	 	a	man	.
she	had	to	look	like	a	man	.
she	had	to	make	other	people	 believ 	 e 	 	that	she	 look 	 ed 	 	like	a	man	and	she	could	have	the	same	 right 	 s 	 	that	the	men	had	.
bernadine	healy	,	dr.	healy	,	was	a	 cardio 	 logist 	 	.
and	right	around	that	time	,	in	the	1980	's	,	that	we	saw	women	and	heart	disease	 death 	 s 	 	going	up	,	up	,	up	,	up	,	up	,
she	wrote	an	 editor 	 ial 	 	in	the	new	england	journal	of	medicine	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	the	yentl	syndrome	.
women	are	 dy 	 ing 	 	of	heart	disease	,	two	,	three	,	four	 time 	 s 	 	more	than	men	.
 mortal 	 ity 	 	is	not	going	down	,	it	's	going	up	.
and	she	 question 	 ed 	 	,	she	 hypothesize 	 d 	 	,	is	 th 	 is 	 	a	yentl	syndrome	?
and	here	's	what	the	story	is	.	is	it	 be 	 cause 	 	women	do	n't	look	like	men	,	they	do	n't	look	like	that	male	-	pattern	heart	disease	and	 get 	 ting 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	good	 diagnos 	 tics 	 	and	 re 	 ally 	 	good	 therapeutic 	 s 	 	,	and	 there 	 fore 	 	,	they	're	not	 recogn 	 ized 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	heart	disease	.
and	they	're	just	 pass 	 ed 	 	.	they	do	n't	get	the	benefit	of	all	the	modern	 medicine 	 s 	 	.
doctor	healy	then	 sub 	 sequent 	 ly 	 	 be 	 came 	 	the	first	female	director	of	our	national	 institute 	 s 	 	of	health	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 bio 	 medical 	 	enterprise	research	in	the	world	.	and	it	 fund 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	my	research	.	it	 fund 	 s 	 	research	all	over	the	place	.
it	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	big	deal	for	her	to	 be 	 come 	 	director	.
and	she	 start 	 ed 	 	,	in	the	face	of	a	lot	of	 contr 	 over 	 s 	 y 	 	,	the	women	's	health	 initi 	 ative 	 	.	and	every	woman	in	the	room	here	 ha 	 s 	 	 benefit 	 ed 	 	from	that	women	's	health	 initi 	 ative 	 	.
it	told	us	about	hormone	 re 	 placement 	 	therapy	.	it	 inform 	 ed 	 	us	about	breast	cancer	,	colon	cancer	in	women	.
so	a	tremendous	fund	of	knowledge	 de 	 spite 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	it	was	too	expensive	.
and	the	under	-	 read 	 ing 	 	was	women	are	n't	worth	it	.
she	was	like	,	``	nope	.	sorry	.	women	are	worth	it	.	``
well	there	was	a	little	piece	of	that	women	's	health	 initi 	 ative 	 	that	went	to	national	heart	,	lung	,	and	blood	institute	,	which	is	the	 cardio 	 logy 	 	part	of	the	nih	.	and	we	got	to	do	the	wise	 stud 	 y 	 	--	and	the	wise	 stand 	 s 	 	for	women	's	ischemia	syndrome	 evalu 	 ation 	 	--	and	i	have	 chair 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	for	the	last	15	 year 	 s 	 	.	it	was	a	 stud 	 y 	 	to	 specific 	 ally 	 	ask	,	what	's	going	on	with	women	?
why	are	more	and	more	women	 dy 	 ing 	 	of	ischemic	heart	disease	?
so	in	the	wise	,	15	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	we	 start 	 ed 	 	out	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	 w 	 ow 	 	,	there	's	a	couple	of	key	 observ 	 ations 	 	and	we	should	 prob 	 ably 	 	follow	up	on	that	.	``
and	our	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	in	washington	,	d.c	.
had	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	that	when	women	have	heart	 attack 	 s 	 	and	die	,	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	men	who	have	heart	 attack 	 s 	 	and	die	--	and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 million 	 s 	 	of	people	,	 happen 	 ing 	 	every	day	--	women	,	in	 the 	 ir 	 	fatty	 pla 	 que 	 	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 the 	 ir 	 	 cor 	 on 	 ary 	 	 art 	 ery 	 	,	so	the	main	blood	supply	going	 in 	 to 	 	the	heart	muscle	--	women	erode	,	men	explode	.
you	're	going	to	find	some	 interest 	 ing 	 	 analog 	 ies 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	physiology	.
so	i	'll	 de 	 scribe 	 	the	male	-	pattern	heart	attack	first	.
hollywood	heart	attack	.	ughhhh	.
 horr 	 ible 	 	chest	pain	.
ekg	 go 	 es 	 	pbbrrhh	,	so	the	 doctor 	 s 	 	can	see	 th 	 is 	 	 huge 	 ly 	 	 ab 	 normal 	 	ekg	.
there	's	a	big	clot	in	the	middle	of	the	 art 	 ery 	 	.
and	they	go	up	to	the	cath	lab	and	boom	,	boom	,	boom	get	rid	of	the	clot	.
that	's	a	man	heart	attack	.
some	women	have	 t 	 hose 	 	heart	 attack 	 s 	 	,	but	a	whole	bunch	of	women	have	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	heart	attack	,	where	it	 erode 	 s 	 	,	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 complete 	 ly 	 	fill	with	clot	,	 symptom 	 s 	 	are	subtle	,
ekg	 find 	 ing 	 s 	 	are	different	--	female	-	pattern	.
so	what	do	you	think	 happen 	 s 	 	to	these	 gal 	 s 	 	?
they	're	often	not	 recogn 	 ized 	 	,	 s 	 ent 	 	home	.
i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	what	it	was	.	might	have	 be 	 en 	 	gas	.
so	we	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	on	that
and	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	,	we	now	have	the	ability	to	look	 in 	 side 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	with	these	special	 catheter 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	ivus	:	intravascular	 ultra 	 sound 	 	.	``
and	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	're	going	to	hypothesize	that	the	fatty	 pla 	 que 	 	in	women	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 prob 	 ably 	 	different	,	and	 deposit 	 ed 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	,	than	men	.	``
and	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	common	knowledge	of	how	women	and	men	get	fat	.
when	we	watch	people	 be 	 come 	 	 obes 	 e 	 	,	where	do	men	get	fat	?
where	do	women	get	fat	?
all	over	.
 cell 	 ulite 	 	here	,	 cell 	 ulite 	 	here	.
so	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	look	,	women	look	like	they	're	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	about	 put 	 ting 	 	kind	of	the	garbage	away	,	 smooth 	 ly 	 	 put 	 ting 	 	it	away	.
men	just	have	to	dump	it	in	a	single	area	.	``
so	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	let	's	look	at	these	.	``	and	so	the	yellow	is	the	fatty	 pla 	 que 	 	,
and	 pan 	 el 	 	a	is	a	man	.
and	you	can	see	,	it	's	 lump 	 y 	 	 bump 	 y 	 	.
he	's	got	a	beer	 bel 	 ly 	 	in	his	 cor 	 on 	 ary 	 	 arteri 	 es 	 	.
 pan 	 el 	 	b	is	the	woman	,	 ver 	 y 	 	smooth	.
she	's	just	laid	it	down	nice	and	tidy	.
and	if	you	did	that	 angio 	 gram 	 	,	which	is	the	red	,	you	can	see	the	man	's	disease	.
so	50	 year 	 s 	 	of	 hon 	 ing 	 	and	 craft 	 ing 	 	these	 angio 	 gram 	 s 	 	,	we	 eas 	 ily 	 	 recogn 	 ize 	 	male	-	pattern	disease	.	kind	of	hard	to	see	that	female	-	pattern	disease	.
so	that	was	a	 discover 	 y 	 	.
now	what	are	the	 implic 	 ations 	 	of	that	?
well	once	 aga 	 in 	 	,	women	get	the	 angio 	 gram 	 	and	 no 	 body 	 	can	tell	that	they	have	a	problem	.
so	we	are	 work 	 ing 	 	now	on	a	non	-	invasive	--	 aga 	 in 	 	,	these	are	all	invasive	 stud 	 ies 	 	.
 ideal 	 ly 	 	you	would	love	to	do	all	 th 	 is 	 	non	-	 invasive 	 ly 	 	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	50	 year 	 s 	 	of	good	non	-	invasive	stress	 test 	 ing 	 	,	we	're	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	at	 recogn 	 izing 	 	male	-	pattern	disease	with	stress	 test 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	cardiac	 magnet 	 ic 	 	 reson 	 ance 	 	 im 	 aging 	 	.	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	at	the	 cedar 	 s 	 	-	sinai	heart	institute	in	the	women	's	heart	center	.
we	 select 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	for	the	research	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	in	your	community	hospital	,	but	we	would	hope	to	 transl 	 ate 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	we	're	about	two	and	a	half	 year 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	five	-	year	 stud 	 y 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 mod 	 ality 	 	that	can	see	the	inner	lining	of	the	heart	.
and	if	you	look	 care 	 fully 	 	,	you	can	see	that	there	's	a	black	blush	right	there	.
and	that	is	 micro 	 vascular 	 	 obstruct 	 ion 	 	.
the	syndrome	,	the	female	-	pattern	now	is	 call 	 ed 	 	 micro 	 vascular 	 	 cor 	 on 	 ary 	 	 dy 	 s 	 function 	 	,	or	 obstruct 	 ion 	 	.
the	second	reason	we	 re 	 ally 	 	 like 	 d 	 	mri	is	that	there	's	no	 radi 	 ation 	 	.
so	 un 	 like 	 	the	cat	 s 	 can 	 s 	 	,	x	-	 ray 	 s 	 	,	thalliums	,	for	women	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	breast	is	in	the	way	of	looking	at	the	heart	,	every	time	we	order	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	even	a	small	amount	of	 radi 	 ation 	 	,	we	say	,	``	do	we	 re 	 ally 	 	need	that	test	?	``
so	we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	m.r	.
you	ca	n't	go	and	order	it	yet	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	area	of	active	 inquir 	 y 	 	where	 actual 	 ly 	 	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	women	is	going	to	advance	the	field	for	women	and	men	.
what	are	the	 down 	 stream 	 	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	then	,	when	female	-	pattern	heart	disease	is	not	 recogn 	 ized 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	figure	from	an	 editor 	 ial 	 	that	i	 publish 	 ed 	 	in	the	european	heart	journal	 th 	 is 	 	last	summer	.
and	it	was	just	a	 pict 	 ogram 	 	to	sort	of	show	why	more	women	are	 dy 	 ing 	 	of	heart	disease	,	 de 	 spite 	 	these	good	 treat 	 ments 	 	that	we	know	and	we	have	work	.
and	when	the	woman	 ha 	 s 	 	male	-	pattern	disease	--	so	she	 look 	 s 	 	like	barbara	in	the	movie	--	they	get	 treat 	 ed 	 	.
and	when	you	have	female	-	pattern	and	you	look	like	a	woman	,	 a 	 s 	 	barbara	 do 	 es 	 	here	with	her	husband	,	they	do	n't	get	the	 treat 	 ment 	 	.
these	are	our	life	-	saving	 treat 	 ments 	 	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	little	red	boxes	are	 death 	 s 	 	.
so	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	.
and	that	is	female	-	pattern	and	why	we	think	the	yentl	syndrome	 actual 	 ly 	 	is	 explain 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	these	 gap 	 s 	 	.
there	's	 be 	 en 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	news	 al 	 so 	 	about	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	women	,	 final 	 ly 	 	,	in	heart	disease	.
and	one	of	the	the	cutting	-	edge	 area 	 s 	 	is	stem	cell	therapy	.
if	you	ask	,	what	is	the	big	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	women	and	men	 physiologic 	 ally 	 	?
why	are	there	women	and	men	?
 be 	 cause 	 	women	 br 	 ing 	 	new	life	 in 	 to 	 	the	world	.
that	's	all	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	.
so	we	 hypothesize 	 d 	 	that	female	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	might	be	better	at	 identify 	 ing 	 	the	 in 	 jury 	 	,	 do 	 ing 	 	some	cellular	repair	or	even	producing	new	 organ 	 s 	 	,	which	is	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	stem	cell	therapy	.
these	are	female	and	male	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	.
and	if	you	had	an	 inju 	 red 	 	organ	,	if	you	had	a	heart	attack	and	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	repair	that	 inju 	 red 	 	area	,	do	you	want	 t 	 hose 	 	 ro 	 bust 	 	,	 ple 	 nt 	 iful 	 	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	on	the	top	?
or	do	you	want	these	 guy 	 s 	 	,	that	look	like	they	're	out	to	lunch	?
and	some	of	our	 invest 	 ig 	 ative 	 	 team 	 s 	 	have	 demonst 	 rated 	 	that	female	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	in	 animal 	 s 	 	and	 increasing 	 ly 	 	we	're	 show 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	 human 	 s 	 	--	that	female	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	,	when	put	even	 in 	 to 	 	a	male	body	,	do	better	than	male	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	going	 in 	 to 	 	a	male	body	.
one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	say	about	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	female	physiology	--	 be 	 cause 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	women	and	heart	disease	,	women	do	,	on	average	,	have	better	 long 	 ev 	 ity 	 	than	men	--	is	that	 un 	 fold 	 ing 	 	the	 secret 	 s 	 	of	female	physiology	and	 understand 	 ing 	 	that	is	going	to	help	men	and	women	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	zero	-	sum	game	in	 any 	 way 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	here	's	where	we	 start 	 ed 	 	.
and	remember	,	 path 	 s 	 	 cross 	 ed 	 	in	1984	,	and	more	and	more	women	 we 	 re 	 	 dy 	 ing 	 	of	 cardio 	 vascular 	 	disease	.
what	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	last	15	 year 	 s 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	work	?
we	are	 bend 	 ing 	 	the	 curv 	 e 	 	.
we	're	 bend 	 ing 	 	the	 curv 	 e 	 	.
so	just	like	the	breast	cancer	story	,	 do 	 ing 	 	research	,	 get 	 ting 	 	 aware 	 ness 	 	going	,	it	 work 	 s 	 	,	you	just	have	to	get	it	going	.
now	are	we	happy	with	 th 	 is 	 	?
we	still	have	two	to	three	more	women	 dy 	 ing 	 	for	every	man	.	and	i	would	 pro 	 pose 	 	,	with	the	better	 long 	 ev 	 ity 	 	that	women	have	 over 	 all 	 	,	that	women	 prob 	 ably 	 	should	 theoretic 	 ally 	 	do	better	,	if	we	could	just	get	 treat 	 ed 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	we	are	,	but	we	have	a	long	row	to	hoe	.
we	've	 work 	 ed 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	for	15	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	i	've	told	you	,	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	male	-	pattern	heart	disease	for	50	 year 	 s 	 	.
so	we	're	35	 year 	 s 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	.
and	we	'd	like	to	think	it	's	not	going	to	take	35	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	in	fact	,	it	 prob 	 ably 	 	wo	n't	.
but	we	can	not	stop	now	.
too	 man 	 y 	 	 live 	 s 	 	are	at	 s 	 take 	 	.
so	what	do	we	need	to	do	?
you	now	,	 hope 	 fully 	 	,	have	a	more	personal	relationship	with	your	heart	.
women	have	heard	the	call	for	breast	cancer	and	they	have	come	out	for	 aware 	 ness 	 	 campaign 	 s 	 	.
the	women	are	 ver 	 y 	 	good	about	 get 	 ting 	 	 mamm 	 ogram 	 s 	 	now	.
and	women	do	 fund 	 raising 	 	.
women	 particip 	 ate 	 	.

 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	need	to	do	with	heart	disease	now	.
and	it	's	 politic 	 al 	 	.

breast	cancer	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 kill 	 s 	 	women	,	but	heart	disease	 kill 	 s 	 	a	whole	bunch	more	.
