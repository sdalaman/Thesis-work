 every 	 body 	 	in	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	's	life	is	 touch 	 ed 	 	by	cancer	--	if	not	 personal 	 ly 	 	,	then	through	a	 love 	 d 	 	one	,	a	family	member	,	 col 	 league 	 	,	friend	.
and	once	our	 live 	 s 	 	are	 touch 	 ed 	 	by	cancer	,	we	 quick 	 ly 	 	learn	that	there	are	 bas 	 ically 	 	three	 weapon 	 s 	 	,	or	three	 tool 	 s 	 	,	that	are	 avail 	 able 	 	to	fight	the	disease	:	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	,	 radi 	 ation 	 	and	 chemo 	 therapy 	 	.
and	once	we	get	 involve 	 d 	 	in	the	therapeutic	 decision 	 s 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	either	 personal 	 ly 	 	or	with	our	 love 	 d 	 	 one 	 s 	 	and	family	 member 	 s 	 	,	we	 al 	 so 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	learn	the	 benefit 	 s 	 	,	the	trade	-	offs	and	the	 limit 	 ations 	 	of	these	 tool 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	 thank 	 ful 	 	to	jay	and	to	mark	and	the	tedmed	team	for	 invit 	 ing 	 	me	 to 	 day 	 	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	a	fourth	tool	,	a	new	tool	,	that	we	call	tumor	 treat 	 ing 	 	 field 	 s 	 	.
tumor	 treat 	 ing 	 	 field 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 invent 	 ed 	 	by	dr.	yoram	palti	,	professor	emeritus	at	the	technion	in	israel	.
and	they	use	low	-	 intens 	 ity 	 	electric	 field 	 s 	 	to	fight	cancer	.
to	understand	how	tumor	 treat 	 ing 	 	 field 	 s 	 	work	,	we	first	need	to	understand	what	are	electric	 field 	 s 	 	.
let	me	first	address	a	few	popular	 mis 	 conception 	 s 	 	.
first	of	all	,	electric	 field 	 s 	 	are	not	an	electric	current	that	is	coursing	through	the	tissue	.
electric	 field 	 s 	 	are	not	ionizing	 radi 	 ation 	 	,	like	x	-	 ray 	 s 	 	or	proton	 beam 	 s 	 	,	that	bombard	tissue	to	disrupt	dna	.
and	electric	 field 	 s 	 	are	not	 magnet 	 ism 	 	.
what	electric	 field 	 s 	 	are	are	a	field	of	 force 	 s 	 	.
and	these	 force 	 s 	 	act	on	,	attract	,	bodies	that	have	an	 electric 	 al 	 	charge	.
the	best	way	to	 visual 	 ize 	 	an	electric	field	is	to	think	of	 gravit 	 y 	 	.
 gravit 	 y 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	a	field	of	 force 	 s 	 	that	act	on	 masse 	 s 	 	.
we	can	all	picture	 astro 	 nauts 	 	in	space	.
they	float	 free 	 ly 	 	in	three	 dimension 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	any	 force 	 s 	 	 act 	 ing 	 	on	them	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	that	space	shuttle	 return 	 s 	 	to	earth	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	the	 astro 	 nauts 	 	enter	the	earth	's	 gravit 	 ation 	 al 	 	field	,	they	begin	to	see	the	 effect 	 s 	 	of	 gravit 	 y 	 	.
they	begin	to	be	 attract 	 ed 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	earth	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	they	land	,	they	're	fully	 align 	 ed 	 	in	the	 gravit 	 ation 	 al 	 	field	.
we	're	,	of	course	,	all	 s 	 tuck 	 	in	the	earth	's	 gravit 	 ation 	 al 	 	field	right	now	.
that	's	why	you	're	all	in	your	 chair 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	why	we	have	to	use	our	muscle	energy	to	stand	up	,	to	walk	around	and	to	lift	 thing 	 s 	 	.
in	cancer	,	 cell 	 s 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	divide	and	lead	to	 un 	 controlled 	 	tumor	growth	.
we	can	think	of	a	cell	from	an	 electric 	 al 	 	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	 a 	 s 	 	if	it	's	a	mini	space	station	.
and	in	that	space	station	we	have	the	genetic	material	,	the	 chromosom 	 es 	 	,	 with 	 in 	 	a	nucleus	.
and	out	in	the	cytoplasmic	soup	we	have	special	 protein 	 s 	 	that	are	 requir 	 ed 	 	for	cell	division	that	float	 free 	 ly 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	soup	in	three	 dimension 	 s 	 	.
 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	special	 protein 	 s 	 	are	among	the	most	 high 	 ly 	 	charged	 object 	 s 	 	in	our	body	.
 a 	 s 	 	cell	division	 begin 	 s 	 	the	nucleus	 dis 	 integrate 	 s 	 	,	the	 chromosom 	 es 	 	line	up	in	the	middle	of	the	cell	and	 t 	 hose 	 	special	 protein 	 s 	 	 under 	 go 	 	a	three	-	dimensional	sequence	 where 	 by 	 	they	attach	and	they	 liter 	 ally 	 	click	 in 	 to 	 	place	end	-	on	-	end	to	form	 chain 	 s 	 	.
these	 chain 	 s 	 	then	progress	and	attach	to	the	genetic	material	and	pull	the	genetic	material	from	one	cell	 in 	 to 	 	two	 cell 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	how	one	cancer	cell	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	two	cancer	 cell 	 s 	 	,	two	cancer	 cell 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	four	cancer	 cell 	 s 	 	,	and	we	have	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	 un 	 controlled 	 	tumor	growth	.
tumor	 treat 	 ing 	 	 field 	 s 	 	use	 external 	 ly 	 	 place 	 d 	 	transducers	 attach 	 ed 	 	to	a	field	 gene 	 rator 	 	to	create	an	artificial	electric	field	on	that	space	station	.
and	when	that	cellular	space	station	is	 with 	 in 	 	the	electric	field	,	it	 act 	 s 	 	on	 t 	 hose 	 	 high 	 ly 	 	charged	 protein 	 s 	 	and	 align 	 s 	 	them	.
and	it	 prevent 	 s 	 	them	from	 form 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 chain 	 s 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	mitotic	spindles	,	that	are	 necess 	 ary 	 	to	pull	the	genetic	material	 in 	 to 	 	the	daughter	 cell 	 s 	 	.
what	we	see	is	that	the	 cell 	 s 	 	will	attempt	to	divide	for	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 hour 	 s 	 	.
and	they	will	either	enter	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	cellular	 su 	 icide 	 	,	 programm 	 ed 	 	cell	death	,	or	they	will	form	 un 	 health 	 y 	 	daughter	 cell 	 s 	 	and	enter	 in 	 to 	 	apoptosis	once	they	have	 divid 	 ed 	 	.
and	we	can	 observ 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
what	i	'm	going	to	show	you	next	are	two	in	vitro	 experiment 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 culture 	 s 	 	,	 ident 	 ical 	 	 culture 	 s 	 	,	of	 cerv 	 ical 	 	cancer	 cell 	 s 	 	.
and	we	've	 stain 	 ed 	 	these	 culture 	 s 	 	with	a	green	 flor 	 escent 	 	dye	so	that	we	can	look	at	these	 protein 	 s 	 	that	form	these	 chain 	 s 	 	.
the	first	clip	 show 	 s 	 	a	normal	cell	division	 with 	 out 	 	the	tumor	 treat 	 ing 	 	 field 	 s 	 	.
what	we	see	are	,	first	of	all	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	active	culture	,	a	lot	of	 division 	 s 	 	,	and	then	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	nuclei	once	the	 cell 	 s 	 	have	 separat 	 ed 	 	.
and	we	can	see	them	 divid 	 ing 	 	 through 	 out 	 	.
when	we	 app 	 ly 	 	the	 field 	 s 	 	--	 aga 	 in 	 	,	in	the	 ident 	 ical 	 	time	-	scale	to	the	 ident 	 ical 	 	culture	--	you	're	going	to	see	 some 	 thing 	 	different	.
the	 cell 	 s 	 	round	up	for	division	,	but	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	static	in	that	position	.
we	'll	see	two	 cell 	 s 	 	in	the	upper	part	of	the	screen	 attempt 	 ing 	 	to	divide	.
the	one	 with 	 in 	 	the	circle	 manage 	 s 	 	.
but	see	how	much	of	the	protein	is	still	 through 	 out 	 	the	nucleus	,	even	in	the	 divid 	 ing 	 	cell	.
the	one	up	there	ca	n't	divide	at	all	.
and	then	 th 	 is 	 	 bubb 	 ling 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	membrane	 bubb 	 ling 	 	,	is	the	 hall 	 mark 	 	of	apoptosis	in	 th 	 is 	 	cell	.
 form 	 ation 	 	of	 health 	 y 	 	mitotic	spindles	is	 necess 	 ary 	 	for	division	in	all	cell	 type 	 s 	 	.
we	've	 appli 	 ed 	 	tumor	 treat 	 ing 	 	 field 	 s 	 	to	over	20	different	 cancer 	 s 	 	in	the	lab	,	and	we	see	 th 	 is 	 	effect	in	all	of	them	.
now	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	these	tumor	 treat 	 ing 	 	 field 	 s 	 	have	no	effect	on	normal	undividing	 cell 	 s 	 	.
10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	dr.	palti	 found 	 ed 	 	a	company	 call 	 ed 	 	novocure	to	develop	his	 discover 	 y 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	practical	therapy	for	 patient 	 s 	 	.
in	that	time	,	novocure	's	 develop 	 ed 	 	two	 system 	 s 	 	--	one	system	for	 cancer 	 s 	 	in	the	head	and	 an 	 other 	 	system	for	 cancer 	 s 	 	in	the	trunk	of	the	body	.
the	first	cancer	that	we	have	focused	on	is	the	 dead 	 ly 	 	brain	cancer	,	gbm	.
gbm	 affect 	 s 	 	about	10,000	people	in	the	u.s.	each	year	.
it	's	a	death	sentence	.
the	 expect 	 ed 	 	five	year	 surviv 	 al 	 	is	less	than	five	percent	.
and	the	typical	patient	with	optimal	therapy	 surviv 	 es 	 	just	a	little	over	a	year	,	and	 on 	 ly 	 	about	seven	 month 	 s 	 	from	the	time	that	the	cancer	is	first	 treat 	 ed 	 	and	then	 come 	 s 	 	back	and	 start 	 s 	 	growing	 aga 	 in 	 	.
novocure	 conduct 	 ed 	 	 it 	 s 	 	first	phase	three	 random 	 ized 	 	trial	in	 patient 	 s 	 	with	 re 	 current 	 	gbm	.
so	these	are	 patient 	 s 	 	who	had	 receiv 	 ed 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	,	high	dose	 radi 	 ation 	 	to	the	head	and	first	-	line	 chemo 	 therapy 	 	,	and	that	had	 fail 	 ed 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 tumor 	 s 	 	had	grown	back	.
we	 divid 	 ed 	 	the	 patient 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	two	 group 	 s 	 	.
the	first	group	 receiv 	 ed 	 	second	-	line	 chemo 	 therapy 	 	,	which	is	 expect 	 ed 	 	to	double	the	life	 expect 	 ancy 	 	,	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	no	 treat 	 ment 	 	at	all	.
and	then	the	second	group	 receiv 	 ed 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	tumor	 treat 	 ing 	 	field	therapy	.
what	we	saw	in	that	trial	is	that	that	the	life	 expect 	 ancies 	 	of	both	 group 	 s 	 	--	so	the	 chemo 	 therapy 	 	 treat 	 ed 	 	group	and	the	tumor	 treat 	 ing 	 	field	group	--	was	the	same	.
but	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	the	tumor	 treat 	 ing 	 	field	group	 suffer 	 ed 	 	 non 	 e 	 	of	the	side	 effect 	 s 	 	typical	of	 chemo 	 therapy 	 	 patient 	 s 	 	.
they	had	no	pain	,	 suffer 	 ed 	 	 non 	 e 	 	of	the	 infect 	 ions 	 	.
they	had	no	 nause 	 a 	 	,	 dia 	 rrhea 	 	,	 con 	 s 	 tip 	 ation 	 	,	fatigue	that	would	be	 expect 	 ed 	 	.
based	on	 th 	 is 	 	trial	,	in	april	of	 th 	 is 	 	year	,	the	fda	approved	tumor	 treat 	 ing 	 	 field 	 s 	 	for	the	 treat 	 ment 	 	of	 patient 	 s 	 	with	 re 	 current 	 	gbm	.
 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	it	was	the	first	time	ever	that	the	fda	 include 	 d 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	approval	of	an	 onco 	 logy 	 	 treat 	 ment 	 	a	quality	of	life	claim	.
so	i	'm	going	to	show	you	now	one	of	the	 patient 	 s 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	trial	.
robert	 d 	 ill 	 	-	bundi	is	a	famous	swiss	 cycl 	 ing 	 	champion	.
he	won	the	gold	 med 	 al 	 	in	moscow	in	the	4,000	meter	 pur 	 suit 	 	.
and	five	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	robert	was	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	with	gbm	.
he	 receiv 	 ed 	 	the	standard	 treat 	 ments 	 	.
he	 receiv 	 ed 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	.
he	 receiv 	 ed 	 	high	dose	 radi 	 ation 	 	to	the	head	.
and	he	 receiv 	 ed 	 	first	-	line	 chemo 	 therapy 	 	.
a	year	after	 th 	 is 	 	 treat 	 ment 	 	--	in	fact	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	his	 base 	 line 	 	mri	.
you	can	see	that	the	black	 region 	 s 	 	in	the	upper	right	 quad 	 rant 	 	are	the	 area 	 s 	 	where	he	had	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	.
and	a	year	after	that	 treat 	 ment 	 	,	his	tumor	grew	back	with	a	 venge 	 ance 	 	.
that	 cloud 	 y 	 	white	mass	that	you	see	is	the	 recur 	 rence 	 	of	the	tumor	.
at	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	he	was	told	by	his	 doctor 	 s 	 	that	he	had	about	3	 month 	 s 	 	to	live	.
he	 enter 	 ed 	 	our	trial	.
and	here	we	can	see	him	 get 	 ting 	 	the	therapy	.
first	of	all	,	these	 electro 	 de 	 s 	 	are	noninvasive	.
they	're	 attach 	 ed 	 	to	the	skin	in	the	area	of	the	tumor	.
here	you	can	see	that	a	technician	is	placing	them	on	there	much	like	 band 	 age 	 s 	 	.
the	 patient 	 s 	 	learn	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 
and	then	the	 patient 	 s 	 	can	 under 	 go 	 	all	the	 activ 	 ities 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 dai 	 ly 	 	life	.
there	's	 non 	 e 	 	of	the	tiredness	.
there	's	 non 	 e 	 	of	what	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	``	chemo	head	.	``
there	's	no	 sens 	 ation 	 	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	interfere	with	 computer 	 s 	 	or	 electric 	 al 	 	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	.
and	the	therapy	is	 deliver 	 ed 	 	 continu 	 ously 	 	at	home	,	 with 	 out 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	hospital	either	 period 	 ically 	 	or	 continu 	 ally 	 	.
these	are	robert	's	mris	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	under	 on 	 ly 	 	ttfield	 treat 	 ment 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	therapy	that	 take 	 s 	 	time	to	work	.
it	's	a	medical	 de 	 vice 	 	;	it	 work 	 s 	 	when	it	's	on	.
but	what	we	can	see	is	,	by	month	six	,	the	tumor	 ha 	 s 	 	 respond 	 ed 	 	and	it	's	 beg 	 un 	 	to	melt	away	.
it	's	still	there	.
by	month	12	,	we	could	 argu 	 e 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	there	's	a	little	bit	of	material	around	the	 edge 	 s 	 	,	but	it	's	 essential 	 ly 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	gone	.
it	's	now	five	 year 	 s 	 	since	robert	's	 diagnos 	 is 	 	,	and	he	's	 al 	 ive 	 	,	but	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	he	's	 health 	 y 	 	and	he	's	at	work	.
i	'm	going	to	let	him	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	short	clip	,	 de 	 scribe 	 	his	 impression 	 s 	 	of	the	therapy	in	his	own	 word 	 s 	 	.
robert	 d 	 ill 	 	-	bundi	:	my	quality	of	life	,	i	rate	what	i	have	 to 	 day 	 	a	bit	different	than	what	most	people	would	 assum 	 e 	 	.
i	am	the	 hap 	 pies 	 t 	 	,	the	 hap 	 pies 	 t 	 	person	in	the	world	.
and	every	single	 morn 	 ing 	 	i	appreciate	life	.
every	night	i	fall	 a 	 sleep 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	well	,	and	i	am	,	i	repeat	,	the	 hap 	 pies 	 t 	 	man	in	the	world	,
and	i	'm	 thank 	 ful 	 	i	am	 al 	 ive 	 	.
bd	:	novocure	's	 al 	 so 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	lung	cancer	 a 	 s 	 	the	second	target	.
we	've	run	a	phase	two	trial	in	switzerland	on	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 re 	 current 	 	 patient 	 s 	 	--	 patient 	 s 	 	who	have	 receiv 	 ed 	 	standard	therapy	and	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	cancer	 ha 	 s 	 	come	back	.
i	'm	going	to	show	you	 an 	 other 	 	clip	of	a	woman	named	lydia	.
lydia	's	a	66	year	-	old	 farm 	 er 	 	in	switzerland	.
she	was	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	with	lung	cancer	five	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
she	 under 	 went 	 	four	different	 regime 	 s 	 	of	 chemo 	 therapy 	 	over	two	 year 	 s 	 	,	 non 	 e 	 	of	which	had	an	effect	.
her	cancer	 continu 	 ed 	 	to	grow	.
three	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	she	 enter 	 ed 	 	the	novocure	lung	cancer	trial	.
you	can	see	,	in	her	case	,	she	's	 wear 	 ing 	 	her	transducer	 array 	 s 	 	,	one	of	the	front	of	her	chest	,	one	on	the	back	,	and	then	the	second	pair	side	-	to	-	side	over	the	liver	.
you	can	see	the	tumor	 treat 	 ing 	 	field	field	 gene 	 rator 	 	,	but	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	you	can	 al 	 so 	 	see	that	she	is	living	her	life	.
she	is	 man 	 aging 	 	her	farm	.
she	's	 interact 	 ing 	 	with	her	 kid 	 s 	 	and	her	grand	 kid 	 s 	 	.
and	when	we	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	her	,	she	 s 	 aid 	 	that	when	she	was	 under 	 going 	 	 chemo 	 therapy 	 	,	she	had	to	go	to	the	hospital	every	month	for	her	infusions	.
her	whole	family	 suffer 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	her	side	effect	profile	came	and	went	.
now	she	can	run	all	of	the	 activ 	 ities 	 	of	her	farm	.
it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
in	the	lab	,	we	've	 observ 	 ed 	 	tremendous	 syn 	 er 	 gie 	 s 	 	between	 chemo 	 therapy 	 	and	tumor	 treat 	 ing 	 	 field 	 s 	 	.
there	's	research	 under 	 way 	 	now	at	harvard	medical	school	to	pick	the	 optim 	 um 	 	 pair 	 s 	 	to	 maxim 	 ize 	 	that	benefit	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	tumor	 treat 	 ing 	 	 field 	 s 	 	will	work	with	 radi 	 ation 	 	and	interrupt	the	self	-	repair	 mechan 	 ism 	 s 	 	that	we	have	.
there	's	now	a	new	research	project	 under 	 way 	 	at	the	karolinska	in	sweden	to	prove	that	 hypo 	 thesis 	 	.
we	have	more	 trial 	 s 	 	 plan 	 ned 	 	for	lung	cancer	,	 pan 	 cre 	 atic 	 	cancer	,	 ov 	 arian 	 	cancer	and	breast	cancer	.
and	i	 firm 	 ly 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	in	the	next	10	 year 	 s 	 	tumor	 treat 	 ing 	 	 field 	 s 	 	will	be	a	weapon	 avail 	 able 	 	to	 doctor 	 s 	 	and	 patient 	 s 	 	for	all	of	these	most	-	difficult	-	to	-	treat	solid	 tumor 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 hope 	 ful 	 	that	in	the	next	 decade 	 s 	 	,	we	will	make	big	strides	on	 reduc 	 ing 	 	that	death	rate	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	so	 challeng 	 ing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	disease	.
thank	you	.
