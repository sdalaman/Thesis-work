what	i	'm	going	to	do	,	in	the	spirit	of	 collabor 	 ative 	 	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	,	is	 simpl 	 y 	 	repeat	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 point 	 s 	 	that	the	three	people	before	me	have	 al 	 ready 	 	made	,
but	do	them	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	creative	 collabor 	 ation 	 	;	``	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 borrow 	 ing 	 	``	--
but	do	it	through	a	 part 	 icular 	 	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	and	that	is	to	ask	about	the	role	of	 user 	 s 	 	and	 consumer 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	world	of	 collabor 	 ative 	 	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	that	jimmy	and	 other 	 s 	 	have	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	.
let	me	just	ask	you	,	to	start	with	,	 th 	 is 	 	simple	question	:	who	 invent 	 ed 	 	the	mountain	bike	?
 be 	 cause 	 	 tradition 	 al 	 	economic	 theor 	 y 	 	would	say	,	well	,	the	mountain	bike	was	 prob 	 ably 	 	 invent 	 ed 	 	by	some	big	bike	corporation	that	had	a	big	r	&	d	lab	where	they	 we 	 re 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	up	new	 project 	 s 	 	,	and	it	came	out	of	there	.	it	did	n't	come	from	there	.
 an 	 other 	 	answer	might	be	,	well	,	it	came	from	a	sort	of	lone	 gen 	 ius 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	in	his	 gar 	 age 	 	,	who	,	 work 	 ing 	 	away	on	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 bike 	 s 	 	,	 come 	 s 	 	up	with	a	bike	out	of	thin	air	.
it	did	n't	come	from	there	.	the	mountain	bike
came	from	 user 	 s 	 	,	came	from	young	 user 	 s 	 	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	a	group	in	 north 	 ern 	 	california	,	who	 we 	 re 	 	 frust 	 rated 	 	with	 tradition 	 al 	 	 rac 	 ing 	 	 bike 	 s 	 	,	which	 we 	 re 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	sort	of	 bike 	 s 	 	that	 ed 	 dy 	 	merckx	 rod 	 e 	 	,	or	your	big	brother	,	and	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 glamor 	 ous 	 	.
but	 al 	 so 	 	 frust 	 rated 	 	with	the	 bike 	 s 	 	that	your	dad	 rod 	 e 	 	,	which	sort	of	had	big	 handle 	 bar 	 s 	 	like	that	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	too	heavy	.
so	,	they	got	the	 frame 	 s 	 	from	these	big	 bike 	 s 	 	,	put	them	together	with	the	 gear 	 s 	 	from	the	 rac 	 ing 	 	 bike 	 s 	 	,	got	the	 brake 	 s 	 	from	 motor 	 cycle 	 s 	 	,	and	sort	of	 mix 	 ed 	 	and	 match 	 ed 	 	 vari 	 ous 	 	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	.
and	for	the	first	,	i	do	n't	know	,	three	to	five	 year 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	life	,	mountain	 bike 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	known	 a 	 s 	 	``	clunkers	.	``
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	just	made	in	a	community	of	 bike 	 rs 	 	,	 main 	 ly 	 	in	 north 	 ern 	 	california	.
and	then	one	of	these	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	that	was	 import 	 ing 	 	 part 	 s 	 	for	the	clunkers	 decide 	 d 	 	to	set	up	in	business	,	start	selling	them	to	other	people	,	and	 gradu 	 ally 	 	 an 	 other 	 	company	 emerge 	 d 	 	out	of	that	,	marin	,	and	it	 prob 	 ably 	 	was	,	i	do	n't	know	,	10	,	 may 	 be 	 	even	15	,	 year 	 s 	 	,	before	the	big	bike	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	 real 	 ized 	 	there	was	a	market	.
30	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	mountain	bike	 sale 	 s 	 
and	mountain	bike	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 
account	for	65	percent	of	bike	 sale 	 s 	 	in	america	.
that	's	58	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 categor 	 y 	 	 entire 	 ly 	 	 create 	 d 	 	by	 consumer 	 s 	 	that	would	not	have	 be 	 en 	 	 create 	 d 	 	by	the	 main 	 stream 	 	bike	market	 be 	 cause 	 	they	could	n't	see	the	need	,	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	;	they	did	n't	have	the	incentive	to	 innov 	 ate 	 	.
the	one	thing	i	think	i	disagree	with	about	yochai	's	 present 	 ation 	 	is	when	he	 s 	 aid 	 	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 cause 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 distribut 	 ive 	 	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	for	 innov 	 ation 	 	to	come	 al 	 ive 	 	.
it	's	when	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 combine 	 s 	 	with	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	passionate	pro	-	am	 consumer 	 s 	 	--	who	are	 knowledge 	 able 	 	;	they	've	got	the	incentive	to	 innov 	 ate 	 	;	they	've	got	the	 tool 	 s 	 	;	they	want	to	--	that	you	get	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	explosion	of	creative	 collabor 	 ation 	 	.
and	out	of	that	,	you	get	the	need	for	the	kind	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	jimmy	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	,	which	is	our	new	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 organ 	 ization 	 	,	or	a	better	way	to	put	it	:	how	do	we	organize	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	?
that	's	now	possible	;	you	do	n't	need	an	 organ 	 ization 	 	to	be	 organize 	 d 	 	,	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	large	and	complex	 task 	 s 	 	,	like	 innov 	 ating 	 	new	 soft 	 ware 	 	 program 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	huge	 challeng 	 e 	 	to	the	way	we	think	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	 come 	 s 	 	about	.
the	 tradition 	 al 	 	view	,	still	 enshrin 	 ed 	 	in	much	of	the	way	that	we	think	about	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	--	in	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	,	in	government	--	is	that	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	is	about	special	people	:	wear	 base 	 ball 	 	 cap 	 s 	 	the	wrong	way	round	,	come	to	 con 	 ference 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	in	special	 place 	 s 	 	,	elite	 un 	 ive 	 rs 	 ities 	 	,	r	&	d	 lab 	 s 	 	in	the	 forest 	 s 	 	,	water	,	 may 	 be 	 	special	rooms	in	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	 paint 	 ed 	 	funny	 color 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	bean	 bag 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	the	odd	table	-	 foot 	 ball 	 	table	.
special	people	,	special	 place 	 s 	 	,	think	up	special	 idea 	 s 	 	,	then	you	have	a	 pipe 	 line 	 	that	 take 	 s 	 	the	 idea 	 s 	 	down	to	the	 wait 	 ing 	 	 consumer 	 s 	 	,	who	are	 pass 	 ive 	 	.
they	can	say	``	 y 	 es 	 	``	or	``	no	``	to	the	 invent 	 ion 	 	.	that	's	the	idea	of	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	.
what	's	the	policy	 recommend 	 ation 	 	out	of	that	if	you	're	in	government	,	or	you	're	running	a	large	company	?
more	special	people	,	more	special	 place 	 s 	 	.
build	creative	 cluster 	 s 	 	in	cities	;	create	more	r	&	d	 park 	 s 	 	,	so	on	and	so	forth	.
expand	the	 pipe 	 line 	 	down	to	the	 consumer 	 s 	 	.
well	 th 	 is 	 	view	,	i	think	,	is	 increasing 	 ly 	 	wrong	.
i	think	it	's	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	wrong	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	 al 	 ways 	 	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 high 	 ly 	 	 collabor 	 ative 	 	,
and	it	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 large 	 ly 	 	 inter 	 active 	 	.
but	it	's	 increasing 	 ly 	 	wrong	,	and	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	it	's	wrong	is	that	the	 idea 	 s 	 	are	 flow 	 ing 	 	back	up	the	 pipe 	 line 	 	.
the	 idea 	 s 	 	are	coming	back	from	the	 consumer 	 s 	 	,	and	they	're	often	 a 	 head 	 	of	the	 produce 	 rs 	 	.
why	is	that	?
well	,	one	issue	is	that	radical	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	when	you	've	got	 idea 	 s 	 	that	affect	a	large	number	of	 techno 	 logies 	 	or	people	,	have	a	great	deal	of	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	 attach 	 ed 	 	to	them	.
the	payoffs	to	 innov 	 ation 	 	are	 great 	 est 	 	where	the	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	is	highest	.
and	when	you	get	a	radical	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	it	's	often	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 certain 	 	how	it	can	be	 appli 	 ed 	 	.
the	whole	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 tele 	 phony 	 	is	a	story	of	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	that	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	.
the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	 land 	 line 	 	 tele 	 phone 	 s 	 	,	the	 inventor 	 s 	 	thought	that	they	would	be	used	for	people	to	listen	in	to	live	 performance 	 s 	 	from	west	end	 theater 	 s 	 	.
when	the	mobile	 tele 	 phone 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	 invent 	 ed 	 	sms	,	they	had	no	idea	what	it	was	for	;	it	was	 on 	 ly 	 	when	that	technology	got	 in 	 to 	 	the	 hand 	 s 	 	of	 teen 	 age 	 	 user 	 s 	 	that	they	 invent 	 ed 	 	the	use	.
so	the	more	radical	the	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	the	more	the	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	,	the	more	you	need	 innov 	 ation 	 	in	use	to	work	out	what	a	technology	is	for	.
all	of	our	 patent 	 s 	 	,	our	entire	approach	to	 patent 	 s 	 	and	 invent 	 ion 	 	,	is	based	on	the	idea	that	the	inventor	 know 	 s 	 	what	the	 invent 	 ion 	 	is	for	;	we	can	say	what	it	's	for	.
more	and	more	,	the	 inventor 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	will	not	be	able	to	say	that	in	advance	.
it	will	be	 work 	 ed 	 	out	in	use	,	in	 collabor 	 ation 	 	with	 user 	 s 	 	.
we	like	to	think	that	 invent 	 ion 	 	is	a	sort	of	moment	of	creation	:	there	is	a	moment	of	birth	when	 some 	 one 	 	 come 	 s 	 	up	with	an	idea	.
the	truth	is	that	most	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	is	cumulative	and	 collabor 	 ative 	 	;
like	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	,	it	 develop 	 s 	 	over	a	long	period	of	time	.
the	second	reason	why	 user 	 s 	 	are	more	and	more	 import 	 ant 	 	is	that	they	are	the	source	of	big	,	 disrupt 	 ive 	 	 innov 	 ations 	 	.
if	you	want	to	find	the	big	new	 idea 	 s 	 	,	it	's	often	difficult	to	find	them	in	 main 	 stream 	 	 market 	 s 	 	,	in	big	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	.
and	just	look	 in 	 side 	 	large	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	and	you	'll	see	why	that	is	so	.
so	,	you	're	in	a	big	corporation	.	you	're	 obvious 	 ly 	 	keen	to	go	up	the	corporate	 lad 	 der 	 	.
do	you	go	 in 	 to 	 	your	board	and	say	,	``	look	,	i	've	got	a	fantastic	idea	for	an	 embryo 	 nic 	 	product	in	a	marginal	market	,	with	 consumer 	 s 	 	we	've	never	 deal 	 t 	 	with	before	,	and	i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	it	's	going	to	have	a	big	 pay 	 off 	 	,	but	it	could	be	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	big	in	the	future	?	``
no	,	what	you	do	,	is	you	go	in	and	you	say	,	``	i	've	got	a	fantastic	idea	for	an	 increment 	 al 	 	 innov 	 ation 	 	to	an	 exist 	 ing 	 	product	we	sell	through	 exist 	 ing 	 	 channel 	 s 	 	to	 exist 	 ing 	 	 user 	 s 	 	,	and	i	can	guarantee	you	get	 th 	 is 	 	much	return	out	of	it	over	the	next	three	 year 	 s 	 	.	``
big	 corporation 	 s 	 	have	an	in	-	built	 tend 	 ency 	 	to	reinforce	past	success	.
they	've	got	so	much	 s 	 un 	 k 	 	in	it	that	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	for	them	to	spot	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	new	 market 	 s 	 	.	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	new	 market 	 s 	 	,	then	,	are	the	 breed 	 ing 	 	 ground 	 s 	 	for	passionate	 user 	 s 	 	.
best	 ex 	 ample 	 	:	who	in	the	music	industry	,	30	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	would	have	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	let	's	invent	a	musical	form	which	is	all	about	 dis 	 possess 	 ed 	 	black	men	in	 ghetto 	 s 	 	 express 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 frust 	 ration 	 	with	the	world	through	a	form	of	music	that	 man 	 y 	 	people	find	 initi 	 ally 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	difficult	to	listen	to	.
that	 sound 	 s 	 	like	a	winner	;	we	'll	go	with	it	.	``
.	so	what	 happen 	 s 	 	?	rap	music	is	 create 	 d 	 	by	the	 user 	 s 	 	.
they	do	it	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 tape 	 s 	 	,	with	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 record 	 ing 	 	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	;	they	 distribut 	 e 	 	it	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
30	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	rap	music	is	the	 domin 	 ant 	 	musical	form	of	popular	culture	--	would	never	have	come	from	the	big	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.
had	to	start	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	third	point	--	with	these	pro	-	 am 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	phrase	that	i	've	used	in	some	stuff	which	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	with	a	think	tank	in	london	 call 	 ed 	 	 demo 	 s 	 	,	where	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	looking	at	these	people	who	are	 amateur 	 s 	 	--	i.e	.	,	they	do	it	for	the	love	of	it	--	but	they	want	to	do	it	to	 ver 	 y 	 	high	 standard 	 s 	 	.
and	 a 	 cross 	 	a	whole	range	of	 field 	 s 	 	--	from	 soft 	 ware 	 	,	 astro 	 nomy 	 	,	natural	 science 	 s 	 	,	vast	 area 	 s 	 	of	leisure	and	culture	like	kite	-	surfing	,	so	on	and	so	forth	--	you	find	people	who	want	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	love	it	,	but	they	want	to	do	these	 thing 	 s 	 	to	 ver 	 y 	 	high	 standard 	 s 	 	.
they	work	at	 the 	 ir 	 	leisure	,	if	you	like	.
they	take	 the 	 ir 	 	leisure	 ver 	 y 	 	 serious 	 ly 	 	:	they	 acquir 	 e 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	;	they	invest	time	;	they	use	technology	that	's	 get 	 ting 	 	 cheap 	 er 	 	--	it	's	not	just	the	 inter 	 net 	 	:	 camera 	 s 	 	,	design	technology	,	leisure	technology	,	 surf 	 board 	 s 	 	,	so	on	and	so	forth	.
 large 	 ly 	 	through	 global 	 ization 	 	,	a	lot	of	 th 	 is 	 	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	got	a	lot	 cheap 	 er 	 	.
more	 knowledge 	 able 	 	 consumer 	 s 	 	,	more	educated	,	more	able	to	connect	with	one	 an 	 other 	 	,	more	able	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	together	.
consumption	,	in	that	sense	,	is	an	 express 	 ion 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	productive	potential	.
why	,	we	found	,	people	 we 	 re 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	,	is	that	at	work	they	do	n't	feel	 ver 	 y 	 	 express 	 ed 	 	.

 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	huge	 organ 	 ization 	 al 	 	 implic 	 ations 	 	for	 ver 	 y 	 	large	 area 	 s 	 	of	life	.

so	here	in	 astro 	 nomy 	 	,	you	have	 th 	 is 	 	vast	explosion	of	new	productive	 resource 	 s 	 	.
the	 user 	 s 	 	can	be	 produce 	 rs 	 	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	mean	,	then	,	for	our	 organ 	 ization 	 al 	 	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	?
well	,	just	imagine	a	world	,	for	the	moment	,	 divid 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	two	 camp 	 s 	 	.
over	here	,	you	've	got	the	old	,	 tradition 	 al 	 	corporate	model	:
special	people	,	special	 place 	 s 	 	;	patent	it	,	push	it	down	the	 pipe 	 line 	 	to	 large 	 ly 	 	 wait 	 ing 	 	,	 pass 	 ive 	 	 consumer 	 s 	 	.
over	here	,	let	's	imagine	we	've	got	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	,	linux	,	and	beyond	--	open	source	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	open	;	 th 	 is 	 	is	closed	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	new	;	 th 	 is 	 	is	 tradition 	 al 	 	.
well	,	the	first	thing	you	can	say	,	i	think	with	 certain 	 ty 	 	,	is	what	yochai	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	--	is	there	is	a	great	big	struggle	between	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 organ 	 ization 	 al 	 	 form 	 s 	 	.
these	people	over	there	will	do	 every 	 thing 	 	they	can	to	stop	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	 succeed 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 threaten 	 ed 	 	by	them	.
and	so	the	 debate 	 s 	 	about	 copy 	 right 	 	,	digital	 right 	 s 	 	,	so	on	and	so	forth	--	these	are	all	about	 try 	 ing 	 	to	stifle	,	in	my	view	,	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	.
what	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	is	a	complete	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	of	the	idea	of	 patent 	 s 	 	and	 copy 	 right 	 	.
 me 	 ant 	 	to	be	a	way	to	incentivize	 invent 	 ion 	 	,	 me 	 ant 	 	to	be	a	way	to	 orchestra 	 te 	 	the	 dis 	 semi 	 nation 	 	of	knowledge	,	they	are	 increasing 	 ly 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	used	by	large	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	to	create	 thick 	 et 	 s 	 	of	 patent 	 s 	 	to	prevent	 innov 	 ation 	 	taking	place	.
let	me	just	give	you	two	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
the	first	is	:	imagine	 your 	 self 	 	going	to	a	venture	 capital 	 ist 	 	and	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	i	've	got	a	fantastic	idea	.
i	've	 invent 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 brilli 	 ant 	 	new	program	that	is	much	,	much	better	than	 micro 	 soft 	 	 out 	 look 	 	.	``
which	venture	 capital 	 ist 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	right	mind	is	going	to	give	you	any	money	to	set	up	a	venture	 com 	 pet 	 ing 	 	with	 micro 	 soft 	 	,	with	 micro 	 soft 	 	 out 	 look 	 	?	no	one	.
that	is	why	the	 com 	 petition 	 	with	 micro 	 soft 	 	is	bound	to	come	--	will	 on 	 ly 	 	come	--	from	an	open	-	source	kind	of	project	.
so	,	there	is	a	huge	competitive	argument	about	 sustain 	 ing 	 	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	for	open	-	source	and	consumer	-	driven	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	one	of	the	 great 	 est 	 	competitive	 lever 	 s 	 	against	 monopol 	 y 	 	.
there	'll	be	huge	professional	 argument 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	 professional 	 s 	 	,	over	here	in	these	closed	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	--	they	might	be	 academic 	 s 	 	;	they	might	be	 programm 	 ers 	 	;	they	might	be	 doctor 	 s 	 	;	they	might	be	 journalist 	 s 	 	--	my	 form 	 er 	 	profession	--	say	,	``	no	,	no	--	you	ca	n't	trust	these	people	over	here	.	``
when	i	 start 	 ed 	 	in	 journal 	 ism 	 	--	financial	 time 	 s 	 	,	20	 year 	 s 	 	ago	--	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	to	see	 some 	 one 	 	 read 	 ing 	 	the	 news 	 paper 	 	.
and	you	'd	kind	of	look	over	 the 	 ir 	 	shoulder	on	the	tube	to	see	if	they	 we 	 re 	 	 read 	 ing 	 	your	article	.
 usual 	 ly 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 read 	 ing 	 	the	share	 price 	 s 	 	,	and	the	bit	of	the	paper	with	your	article	on	was	on	the	floor	,	or	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	,	and	you	know	,	``	for	heaven	's	sake	,	what	are	they	 do 	 ing 	 	!
they	're	not	 read 	 ing 	 	my	 brilli 	 ant 	 	article	!	``
and	we	 allow 	 ed 	 	 user 	 s 	 	,	 read 	 ers 	 	,	two	 place 	 s 	 	where	they	could	 con 	 tribute 	 	to	the	paper	:	the	 letter 	 s 	 	page	,	where	they	could	write	a	letter	in	,	and	we	would	condescend	to	them	,	cut	it	in	half	,	and	print	it	three	 day 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
or	the	op	-	ed	page	,	where	if	they	 k 	 new 	 	the	editor	--	had	 be 	 en 	 	to	school	with	him	,	slept	with	his	wife	--	they	could	write	an	article	for	the	op	-	ed	page	.
 t 	 hose 	 	 we 	 re 	 	the	two	 place 	 s 	 	.
shock	,	 horr 	 or 	 	:	now	,	the	 read 	 ers 	 	want	to	be	 writer 	 s 	 	and	 publish 	 ers 	 	.
that	's	not	 the 	 ir 	 	role	;	they	're	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	read	what	we	write	.
but	they	do	n't	want	to	be	 journalist 	 s 	 	.	the	 journalist 	 s 	 	think	that	the	 blogger 	 s 	 	want	to	be	 journalist 	 s 	 	;	they	do	n't	want	to	be	 journalist 	 s 	 	;	they	just	want	to	have	a	voice	.
they	want	to	,	 a 	 s 	 	jimmy	 s 	 aid 	 	,	they	want	to	have	a	 dial 	 ogue 	 	,	a	conversation	.
they	want	to	be	part	of	that	flow	of	information	.
what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	there	is	that	the	whole	domain	of	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	is	 expand 	 ing 	 	.
so	,	there	's	going	to	be	a	tremendous	struggle	.
but	,	 al 	 so 	 	,	there	's	going	to	be	tremendous	 move 	 ment 	 	from	the	open	to	the	closed	.
what	you	'll	see	,	i	think	,	is	two	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	critical	,	and	these	,	i	think	,	are	two	 challeng 	 es 	 	for	the	open	 move 	 ment 	 	.
the	first	is	:	can	we	 re 	 ally 	 	 surviv 	 e 	 	on	 volunteer 	 s 	 	?
if	 th 	 is 	 	is	so	critical	,	do	we	not	need	it	funded	,	 organize 	 d 	 	,	 support 	 ed 	 	in	much	more	 structure 	 d 	 	ways	?
i	think	the	idea	of	creating	the	red	cross	for	information	and	knowledge	is	a	fantastic	idea	,	but	can	we	 re 	 ally 	 	organize	that	,	just	on	 volunteer 	 s 	 	?
what	kind	of	 change 	 s 	 	do	we	need	in	public	policy	and	 fund 	 ing 	 	to	make	that	possible	?
what	's	the	role	of	the	bbc	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	in	that	world	?
what	should	be	the	role	of	public	policy	?
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	what	i	think	you	will	see	is	the	intelligent	,	closed	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	moving	 increasing 	 ly 	 	in	the	open	direction	.
so	it	's	not	going	to	be	a	contest	between	two	 camp 	 s 	 	,	but	,	in	between	them	,	you	'll	find	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	 place 	 s 	 	that	people	will	occupy	.
new	 organ 	 ization 	 al 	 	 model 	 s 	 	coming	about	,	 mix 	 ing 	 	closed	and	open	in	 trick 	 y 	 	ways	.
it	wo	n't	be	so	clear	-	cut	;	it	wo	n't	be	 micro 	 soft 	 	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	linux	--	there	'll	be	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	in	between	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 al 	 	 model 	 s 	 	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	are	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	,	and	the	people	who	can	understand	them	will	be	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	.
let	me	just	give	you	one	final	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	.
i	was	in	shanghai	,	in	an	 off 	 ice 	 	block	built	on	what	was	a	rice	 padd 	 y 	 	five	 year 	 s 	 	ago	--	one	of	the	2,500	 sky 	 scrap 	 ers 	 	they	've	built	in	shanghai	in	the	last	10	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	i	was	 hav 	 ing 	 	 d 	 inner 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	guy	 call 	 ed 	 	timothy	chan	.
timothy	chan	set	up	an	 inter 	 net 	 	business	in	2000	.
did	n't	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	 ke 	 pt 	 	his	money	,	 decide 	 d 	 	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	computer	 game 	 s 	 	.
he	 run 	 s 	 	a	company	 call 	 ed 	 	shanda	,	which	is	the	largest	computer	 game 	 s 	 	company	in	 chin 	 a 	 	.
9,000	 serv 	 ers 	 	all	over	 chin 	 a 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	250	million	 sub 	 scribe 	 rs 	 	.
at	any	one	time	,	there	are	four	million	people	 play 	 ing 	 	one	of	his	 game 	 s 	 	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	people	 do 	 es 	 	he	employ	to	service	that	population	?
500	people	.
well	,	how	can	he	service	250	million	people	from	500	 employ 	 ees 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	service	them	.
he	 give 	 s 	 	them	a	platform	;	he	 give 	 s 	 	them	some	 rule 	 s 	 	;	he	 give 	 s 	 	them	the	 tool 	 s 	 	and	then	he	kind	of	orchestrates	the	conversation	;	he	orchestrates	the	action	.
but	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	a	lot	of	the	content	is	 create 	 d 	 	by	the	 user 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
and	it	 create 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	stickiness	between	the	community	and	the	company	which	is	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	.
the	best	measure	of	that	:	so	you	go	 in 	 to 	 	one	of	his	 game 	 s 	 	,	you	create	a	character	that	you	develop	in	the	course	of	the	game	.
if	,	for	some	reason	,	your	credit	card	 bounc 	 es 	 	,	or	there	's	some	other	problem	,	you	lose	your	character	.
you	've	got	two	 option 	 s 	 	.
one	option	:	you	can	create	a	new	character	,	right	from	scratch	,	but	with	 non 	 e 	 	of	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	your	player	.
that	 cost 	 s 	 	about	100	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
or	you	can	get	on	a	plane	,	fly	to	shanghai	,	queue	up	 out 	 side 	 	shanda	's	 off 	 ice 	 s 	 	--	cost	 prob 	 ably 	 	600	,	700	 dollar 	 s 	 	--	and	 re 	 claim 	 	your	character	,	get	your	 histo 	 ry 	 	back	.
every	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	there	are	600	people	queuing	 out 	 side 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 off 	 ice 	 s 	 	to	 re 	 claim 	 	these	 character 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	about	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	built	on	 commun 	 ities 	 	,	that	provide	 commun 	 ities 	 	with	 tool 	 s 	 	,	 resource 	 s 	 	,	 platform 	 s 	 	in	which	they	can	share	.
he	's	not	open	source	,	but	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	.
so	here	is	one	of	the	 challeng 	 es 	 	,	i	think	,	for	people	like	me	,	who	do	a	lot	of	work	with	government	.
if	you	're	a	 game 	 s 	 	company	,	and	you	've	got	a	million	 player 	 s 	 	in	your	game	,	you	 on 	 ly 	 	need	one	percent	of	them	to	be	co	-	 develop 	 ers 	 	,	 con 	 trib 	 uting 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	,	and	you	've	got	a	 develop 	 ment 	 	 work 	 force 	 	of	10,000	people	.
imagine	you	could	take	all	the	children	in	education	in	britain	,	and	one	percent	of	them	 we 	 re 	 	co	-	 develop 	 ers 	 	of	education	.
what	would	that	do	to	the	 resource 	 s 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	to	the	education	system	?
or	if	you	got	one	percent	of	the	 patient 	 s 	 	in	the	nhs	to	,	in	some	sense	,	be	co	-	 produce 	 rs 	 	of	health	.
the	reason	why	--	 de 	 spite 	 	all	the	 effort 	 s 	 	to	cut	it	down	,	to	 con 	 s 	 train 	 	it	,	to	hold	it	back	--	why	these	open	 model 	 s 	 	will	still	start	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	with	tremendous	force	,	is	that	they	 multi 	 ply 	 	our	productive	 resource 	 s 	 	.
and	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	they	do	that	is	that	they	turn	 user 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 produce 	 rs 	 	,	 consumer 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 design 	 ers 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
