i	want	to	share	with	you	over	the	next	18	 minute 	 s 	 	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	idea	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	big	idea	.
but	to	get	us	 start 	 ed 	 	,	i	want	to	ask	if	 every 	 one 	 	could	just	close	your	 eye 	 s 	 	for	two	 second 	 s 	 	and	try	and	think	of	a	technology	or	a	bit	of	science	that	you	think	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	the	world	.
now	i	bet	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	audience	,	you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	of	some	 re 	 ally 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	technology	,	some	stuff	that	i	have	n't	even	heard	of	,	i	'm	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	.
but	i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	,	 pre 	 tty 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	,	that	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 no 	 body 	 	is	 think 	 ing 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 poli 	 o 	 	 vaccin 	 e 	 	.
and	it	's	a	great	thing	 actual 	 ly 	 	that	 no 	 body 	 	's	had	to	think	about	it	here	 to 	 day 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	we	can	take	 th 	 is 	 	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	great	technology	.
we	can	take	it	 complete 	 ly 	 	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	.
but	it	was	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	that	way	.
even	here	in	california	,	if	we	 we 	 re 	 	to	go	back	just	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	it	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	story	.
people	 we 	 re 	 	 terr 	 ified 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	disease	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 terr 	 ified 	 	of	 poli 	 o 	 	,	and	it	would	cause	public	panic	.
and	it	was	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 scene 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	scene	,	people	are	living	in	an	iron	lung	.
these	are	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 health 	 y 	 	two	or	three	 day 	 s 	 	before	,	and	then	two	 day 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	they	can	no	 long 	 er 	 	breathe	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 poli 	 o 	 	virus	 ha 	 s 	 	 paralyze 	 d 	 	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 arm 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 leg 	 s 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 breath 	 ing 	 	 muscle 	 s 	 	.
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	 s 	 pend 	 	the	rest	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	,	 usual 	 ly 	 	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	iron	lung	to	breathe	for	them	.
 th 	 is 	 	disease	was	 terrify 	 ing 	 	.	there	was	no	cure	,	and	there	was	no	 vaccin 	 e 	 	.
the	disease	was	so	 terrify 	 ing 	 	that	the	 p 	 resident 	 	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 launch 	 ed 	 	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	national	effort	to	find	a	way	to	stop	it	.
twenty	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	they	 succeed 	 ed 	 	and	 develop 	 ed 	 	the	 poli 	 o 	 	 vaccin 	 e 	 	.
it	was	 hail 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	scientific	miracle	in	the	late	1950s	.
 final 	 ly 	 	,	a	 vaccin 	 e 	 	that	could	stop	 th 	 is 	 	awful	disease	,
and	here	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	it	had	an	 in 	 credible 	 	impact	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	the	virus	 stop 	 ped 	 	,	and	it	 stop 	 ped 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	fast	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	was	n't	the	case	 every 	 where 	 	in	the	world	.
and	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	so	fast	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	 how 	 ever 	 	,	that	even	just	last	month	jon	stewart	 s 	 aid 	 	 th 	 is 	 	:	jon	stewart	:	where	is	 poli 	 o 	 	still	active	?
 be 	 cause 	 	i	thought	that	had	 be 	 en 	 	 eradic 	 ated 	 	in	the	way	that	 small 	 pox 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	 eradic 	 ated 	 	.
bruce	aylward	:	 oop 	 s 	 	.	jon	,	 poli 	 o 	 	's	 al 	 most 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 eradic 	 ated 	 	.
but	the	 re 	 ality 	 	is	that	 poli 	 o 	 	still	 exist 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
we	made	 th 	 is 	 	map	for	jon	to	try	to	show	him	 exact 	 ly 	 	where	 poli 	 o 	 	still	 exist 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	picture	.
there	's	not	 ver 	 y 	 	much	left	in	the	world	.
but	the	reason	there	's	not	 ver 	 y 	 	much	left	is	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	public	/	private	 partner 	 ship 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	the	 scene 	 s 	 	,	 al 	 most 	 	 un 	 known 	 	,	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	to	most	of	you	here	 to 	 day 	 	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	for	20	 year 	 s 	 	to	try	and	 eradic 	 ate 	 	 th 	 is 	 	disease	,
and	it	's	got	it	down	to	these	few	 case 	 s 	 	that	you	can	see	here	on	 th 	 is 	 	graphic	.
but	just	last	year	,	we	had	an	 in 	 credible 	 	shock	and	 real 	 ized 	 	that	 al 	 most 	 	just	is	n't	good	 en 	 ough 	 	with	a	virus	like	 poli 	 o 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	reason	:	in	two	 count 	 ries 	 	that	had	n't	had	 th 	 is 	 	disease	for	more	than	 prob 	 ably 	 	a	decade	,	on	 oppos 	 ite 	 	 side 	 s 	 	of	the	 glob 	 e 	 	,	there	was	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 terr 	 ible 	 	 poli 	 o 	 	 out 	 break 	 s 	 	.
 hundred 	 s 	 	of	people	 we 	 re 	 	 paralyze 	 d 	 	.
 hundred 	 s 	 	of	people	 di 	 ed 	 	--	children	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 adult 	 s 	 	.
and	in	both	 case 	 s 	 	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	use	genetic	 s 	 equ 	 encing 	 	to	look	at	the	 poli 	 o 	 	viruses	,
and	we	could	tell	these	viruses	 we 	 re 	 	not	from	these	 count 	 ries 	 	.
they	had	come	from	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 mile 	 s 	 	away	.
and	in	one	case	,	it	 origin 	 ated 	 	on	 an 	 other 	 	continent	.
and	not	 on 	 ly 	 	that	,	but	when	they	came	 in 	 to 	 	these	 count 	 ries 	 	,	then	they	got	on	commercial	 jet 	 liner 	 s 	 	 prob 	 ably 	 	and	they	 travel 	 ed 	 	even	 far 	 ther 	 	to	other	 place 	 s 	 	like	russia	,	where	,	for	the	first	time	in	over	a	decade	last	year	,	children	 we 	 re 	 	 c 	 rippl 	 ed 	 	and	 paralyze 	 d 	 	by	a	disease	that	they	had	not	 s 	 een 	 	for	 year 	 s 	 	.
now	all	of	these	 out 	 break 	 s 	 	that	i	just	 show 	 ed 	 	you	,	these	are	under	control	now	,	and	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	they	'll	 prob 	 ably 	 	stop	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
but	the	 mess 	 age 	 	was	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	.
 poli 	 o 	 	is	still	a	 deva 	 stat 	 ing 	 	,	explosive	disease	.
it	's	just	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	 an 	 other 	 	part	of	the	world	.
and	our	big	idea	is	that	the	scientific	miracle	of	 th 	 is 	 	decade	should	be	the	complete	 eradic 	 ation 	 	of	poliomyelitis	.
so	i	want	to	tell	you	a	little	bit	about	what	 th 	 is 	 	 partner 	 ship 	 	,	the	 poli 	 o 	 	 partner 	 ship 	 	,	is	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	.
we	're	not	 try 	 ing 	 	to	control	 poli 	 o 	 	.
we	're	not	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	it	down	to	just	a	few	 case 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	disease	is	like	a	root	fire	;	it	can	explode	 aga 	 in 	 	if	you	do	n't	snuff	it	out	 complete 	 ly 	 	.
so	what	we	're	looking	for	is	a	permanent	solution	.
we	want	a	world	in	which	every	child	,	just	like	you	 guy 	 s 	 	,	can	take	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	a	 poli 	 o 	 	-	free	world	.
so	we	're	looking	for	a	permanent	solution	,
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	we	get	 luck 	 y 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	 ver 	 y 	 	few	viruses	in	the	world	where	there	are	big	 en 	 ough 	 	 crack 	 s 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	 arm 	 or 	 	that	we	can	try	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	 tru 	 ly 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	virus	can	 on 	 ly 	 	 surviv 	 e 	 	in	people	.
it	ca	n't	live	for	a	 ver 	 y 	 	long	time	in	people	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 surviv 	 e 	 	in	the	environment	 hard 	 ly 	 	at	all	.
and	we	've	got	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	 vaccin 	 es 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	've	just	 show 	 ed 	 	you	.
so	we	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	wipe	out	 th 	 is 	 	virus	 complete 	 ly 	 	.
what	the	 poli 	 o 	 	 eradic 	 ation 	 	program	is	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	is	to	kill	the	virus	 it 	 self 	 	that	 cause 	 s 	 	 poli 	 o 	 	 every 	 where 	 	on	earth	.
now	we	do	n't	have	a	great	track	record	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	to	 eradic 	 ating 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 tri 	 ed 	 	six	 time 	 s 	 	in	the	last	century	,	and	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	once	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	disease	 eradic 	 ation 	 	,	it	's	still	the	venture	capital	of	public	health	.
the	 risk 	 s 	 	are	massive	,	but	the	pay	-	off	--	economic	,	 human 	 itarian 	 	,	 motiv 	 ation 	 al 	 	--	it	's	 absolute 	 ly 	 	huge	.
one	 congress 	 man 	 	here	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 think 	 s 	 	that	the	entire	 invest 	 ment 	 	that	the	u.s.	put	 in 	 to 	 	 small 	 pox 	 	 eradic 	 ation 	 	 pay 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	off	every	26	 day 	 s 	 	--	in	 fore 	 gone 	 	 treat 	 ment 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	and	 vaccin 	 ation 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	.
and	if	we	can	finish	 poli 	 o 	 	 eradic 	 ation 	 	,	the	 poor 	 est 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	in	the	world	are	going	to	 s 	 ave 	 	over	50	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	the	next	25	 year 	 s 	 	 al 	 one 	 	.
so	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	kind	of	 s 	 take 	 s 	 	that	we	're	after	.
but	 small 	 pox 	 	 eradic 	 ation 	 	was	hard	;	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	.
and	 poli 	 o 	 	 eradic 	 ation 	 	,	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	,	is	even	 tough 	 er 	 	,
and	there	's	a	few	 reason 	 s 	 	for	that	.
the	first	is	that	,	when	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 eradic 	 ate 	 	 poli 	 o 	 	about	20	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	more	than	twice	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 infect 	 ed 	 	than	had	 be 	 en 	 	when	we	 start 	 ed 	 	off	with	 small 	 pox 	 	.
and	there	 we 	 re 	 	more	than	10	 time 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	living	in	these	 count 	 ries 	 	.
so	it	was	a	massive	effort	.
the	second	 challeng 	 e 	 	we	had	was	--	in	contrast	to	the	 small 	 pox 	 	 vaccin 	 e 	 	,	which	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 table 	 	,	and	a	single	dose	 protect 	 ed 	 	you	for	life	--	the	 poli 	 o 	 	 vaccin 	 e 	 	is	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	fragile	.
it	 deterio 	 rates 	 	so	 quick 	 ly 	 	in	the	 tropic 	 s 	 	that	we	've	had	to	put	 th 	 is 	 	special	 vaccin 	 e 	 	monitor	on	every	single	vial	so	that	it	will	change	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	when	it	's	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	to	too	much	heat	,	and	we	can	tell	that	it	's	not	a	good	 vaccin 	 e 	 	to	use	on	a	child	--	it	's	not	potent	;	it	's	not	going	to	protect	them	.
even	then	,	 kid 	 s 	 	need	 man 	 y 	 	 dose 	 s 	 	of	the	 vaccin 	 e 	 	.
but	the	third	 challeng 	 e 	 	we	have	--	and	 prob 	 ably 	 	even	 big 	 ger 	 	one	,	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 challeng 	 e 	 	--	is	that	,	in	contrast	to	 small 	 pox 	 	where	you	could	 al 	 ways 	 	see	your	 ene 	 my 	 	--	every	single	person	 al 	 most 	 	who	was	 infect 	 ed 	 	with	 small 	 pox 	 	had	 th 	 is 	 	 tell 	 tale 	 	rash	.
so	you	could	get	around	the	disease	;	you	could	 vaccin 	 ate 	 	around	the	disease	and	cut	it	off	.
with	 poli 	 o 	 	it	's	 al 	 most 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	.
the	vast	 major 	 ity 	 	of	people	who	are	 infect 	 ed 	 	with	the	 poli 	 o 	 	virus	show	 absolute 	 ly 	 	no	sign	of	the	disease	.
so	you	ca	n't	see	the	 ene 	 my 	 	most	of	the	time	,
and	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	,	we	've	 need 	 ed 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	approach	to	 eradic 	 ate 	 	 poli 	 o 	 	than	what	was	 d 	 one 	 	with	 small 	 pox 	 	.
we	've	had	to	create	one	of	the	largest	social	 move 	 ments 	 	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
there	's	over	10	million	people	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	20	million	people	,	 large 	 ly 	 	 volunteer 	 s 	 	,	who	have	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	over	the	last	20	 year 	 s 	 	in	what	 ha 	 s 	 	now	 be 	 en 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	largest	 inter 	 national 	 ly 	 	-	 coordinate 	 d 	 	operation	in	 peace 	 time 	 	.
these	people	,	these	20	million	people	,	 vaccin 	 ate 	 	over	500	million	children	every	single	year	,	 multi 	 ple 	 	 time 	 s 	 	at	the	peak	of	our	operation	.
now	giving	the	 poli 	 o 	 	 vaccin 	 e 	 	is	simple	.
it	's	just	two	 drop 	 s 	 	,	like	that	.
but	 reach 	 ing 	 	500	million	people	is	much	,	much	 tough 	 er 	 	.
and	these	 vaccin 	 ators 	 	,	these	 volunteer 	 s 	 	,	they	have	got	to	 d 	 ive 	 	 head 	 long 	 	 in 	 to 	 	some	of	the	 tough 	 est 	 	,	 dense 	 st 	 	urban	 s 	 lum 	 s 	 	in	the	world	.
they	've	got	to	trek	under	 s 	 wel 	 tering 	 	 s 	 un 	 s 	 	to	some	of	the	most	remote	,	difficult	to	reach	 place 	 s 	 	in	the	world	.
and	they	 al 	 so 	 	have	to	dodge	 bullet 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	got	to	 oper 	 ate 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	 sha 	 ky 	 	cease	-	 fire 	 s 	 	and	 truce 	 s 	 	to	try	and	 vaccin 	 ate 	 	children	,	even	in	 area 	 s 	 	 affect 	 ed 	 	by	conflict	.
one	 report 	 er 	 	who	was	 watch 	 ing 	 	our	program	in	somalia	about	five	 year 	 s 	 	ago	--	a	place	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 eradic 	 ated 	 	 poli 	 o 	 	,	not	once	,	but	twice	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	got	 re 	 infect 	 ed 	 	.
he	was	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	 out 	 side 	 	of	the	road	,	 watch 	 ing 	 	one	of	these	 poli 	 o 	 	 campaign 	 s 	 	 un 	 fold 	 	,	and	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	he	wrote	:	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	foreign	aid	at	 it 	 s 	 	most	 hero 	 ic 	 	.	``	and	these	heroes	,	they	come	from	every	walk	of	life	,	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 back 	 ground 	 s 	 	.
but	one	of	the	most	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	is	 rot 	 ary 	 	 inter 	 national 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	group	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	million	-	strong	 arm 	 y 	 	of	 volunteer 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	to	 eradic 	 ate 	 	 poli 	 o 	 	for	over	20	 year 	 s 	 	.
they	're	right	at	the	center	of	the	whole	thing	.
now	it	took	 year 	 s 	 	to	build	up	the	 infra 	 structure 	 	for	 poli 	 o 	 	 eradic 	 ation 	 	--	more	than	15	 year 	 s 	 	,	much	 long 	 er 	 	than	it	should	have	--	but	once	it	was	built	,	the	 result 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 tri 	 king 	 	.
 with 	 in 	 	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	every	country	that	 start 	 ed 	 	 poli 	 o 	 	 eradic 	 ation 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	 eradic 	 ated 	 	all	three	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 poli 	 o 	 	viruses	,	with	the	exception	of	four	 count 	 ries 	 	that	you	see	here	.
and	in	each	of	 t 	 hose 	 	,	it	was	 on 	 ly 	 	part	of	the	country	.
and	then	,	by	1999	,	one	of	the	three	 poli 	 o 	 	viruses	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 eradic 	 ate 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	 eradic 	 ated 	 	 world 	 wide 	 	--	proof	of	 con 	 cept 	 	.
and	then	 to 	 day 	 	,	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	99	percent	 r 	 eduction 	 	--	 great 	 er 	 	than	99	percent	 r 	 eduction 	 	--	in	the	number	of	children	who	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 paralyze 	 d 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	awful	disease	.
when	we	 start 	 ed 	 	,	over	20	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	1,000	children	 we 	 re 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 paralyze 	 d 	 	every	single	day	by	 th 	 is 	 	virus	.
last	year	,	it	was	1,000	.
and	at	the	same	time	,	the	 poli 	 o 	 	 eradic 	 ation 	 	program	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	to	help	with	a	lot	of	other	 area 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	to	help	control	 pan 	 demic 	 	flu	,	sars	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	 s 	 ave 	 	children	by	 do 	 ing 	 	other	 thing 	 s 	 	--	giving	 vita 	 min 	 	a	 drop 	 s 	 	,	giving	 mea 	 s 	 les 	 	 shot 	 s 	 	,	giving	bed	 net 	 s 	 	against	malaria	even	 dur 	 ing 	 	some	of	these	 campaign 	 s 	 	.
but	the	most	 excit 	 ing 	 	thing	that	the	 poli 	 o 	 	 eradic 	 ation 	 	program	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	to	force	us	,	the	 inter 	 national 	 	community	,	to	reach	every	single	child	,	every	single	community	,	the	most	 vulner 	 able 	 	people	in	the	world	,	with	the	most	 bas 	 ic 	 	of	health	 service 	 s 	 	,	 ir 	 respect 	 ive 	 	of	 geo 	 graphy 	 	,	poverty	,	culture	and	even	conflict	.
so	 thing 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	looking	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	,	and	then	about	five	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 th 	 is 	 	virus	,	 th 	 is 	 	ancient	virus	,	 start 	 ed 	 	to	fight	back	.
the	first	problem	we	ran	 in 	 to 	 	was	that	,	in	these	last	four	 count 	 ries 	 	,	the	 strong 	 hold 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	virus	,	we	just	could	n't	seem	to	get	the	virus	 root 	 ed 	 	out	.
and	then	to	make	the	 matter 	 s 	 	even	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	the	virus	 start 	 ed 	 	to	spread	out	of	these	four	 place 	 s 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 north 	 ern 	 	india	and	 north 	 ern 	 	nigeria	,	 in 	 to 	 	much	of	africa	,	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	,	and	even	 in 	 to 	 	europe	,	 caus 	 ing 	 	 horr 	 ific 	 	 out 	 break 	 s 	 	in	 place 	 s 	 	that	had	not	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	disease	for	 decade 	 s 	 	.
and	then	,	in	one	of	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	,	 ten 	 acious 	 	and	 tough 	 est 	 	 reservoir 	 s 	 	of	the	 poli 	 o 	 	virus	in	the	world	,	we	found	that	our	 vaccin 	 e 	 	was	 work 	 ing 	 	half	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	it	should	have	.
in	 condition 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	the	 vaccin 	 e 	 	just	could	n't	get	the	grip	it	 need 	 ed 	 	to	in	the	 gut 	 s 	 	of	these	children	and	protect	them	the	way	that	it	 need 	 ed 	 	to	.
now	at	that	time	,	there	was	a	great	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	imagine	,	 frust 	 ration 	 	--	let	's	call	it	 frust 	 ration 	 	--	it	 start 	 ed 	 	to	grow	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
and	all	of	a	sudden	,	some	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 voice 	 s 	 	in	the	world	of	public	health	 start 	 ed 	 	to	say	,	``	hang	on	.
we	should	abandon	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	 eradic 	 ation 	 	.
let	's	settle	for	control	--	that	's	good	 en 	 ough 	 	.	``	now	 a 	 s 	 	 s 	 e 	 duct 	 ive 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	idea	of	control	 sound 	 s 	 	,	it	's	a	false	 pre 	 mise 	 	.
the	brutal	truth	is	,	if	we	do	n't	have	the	will	or	the	skill	,	or	even	the	money	that	we	need	to	reach	children	,	the	most	 vulner 	 able 	 	children	in	the	world	,	with	 some 	 thing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	simple	 a 	 s 	 	an	 or 	 al 	 	 poli 	 o 	 	 vaccin 	 e 	 	,	then	 pre 	 tty 	 	soon	,	more	than	200,000	children	are	 aga 	 in 	 	going	to	be	 paralyze 	 d 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	disease	every	single	year	.
there	's	 absolute 	 ly 	 	no	question	.
these	are	children	like	umar	.
umar	is	seven	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	and	he	's	from	 north 	 ern 	 	nigeria	.
he	 live 	 s 	 	in	a	family	home	there	with	his	eight	 brother 	 s 	 	and	 sister 	 s 	 	.
umar	 al 	 so 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 poli 	 o 	 	.
umar	was	 paralyze 	 d 	 	for	life	.
his	right	leg	was	 paralyze 	 d 	 	in	2004	.
 th 	 is 	 	leg	,	his	right	leg	,	now	 take 	 s 	 	an	awful	 beat 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 ha 	 s 	 	to	half	-	crawl	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 fast 	 er 	 	to	move	that	way	to	keep	up	with	his	 friend 	 s 	 	,	keep	up	with	his	 brother 	 s 	 	and	 sister 	 s 	 	,	than	to	get	up	on	his	 crutch 	 es 	 	and	walk	.
but	umar	is	a	fantastic	student	.	he	's	an	 in 	 credible 	 	kid	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	ca	n't	see	the	detail	here	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	his	report	card	,
and	you	'll	see	,	he	's	got	perfect	 score 	 s 	 	.
he	got	100	percent	in	all	the	 import 	 ant 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	like	 nurse 	 ry 	 	 rhym 	 es 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	there	.
but	you	know	i	'd	love	to	be	able	to	tell	you	that	umar	is	a	typical	kid	with	 poli 	 o 	 	these	 day 	 s 	 	,	but	it	's	not	true	.
umar	is	an	 exception 	 al 	 	kid	in	 exception 	 al 	 	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	.
the	 re 	 ality 	 	of	 poli 	 o 	 	 to 	 day 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	different	.
 poli 	 o 	 	 strike 	 s 	 	the	 poor 	 est 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	in	the	world	.
it	 leav 	 es 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	children	 paralyze 	 d 	 	,	and	it	 drag 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	 deep 	 er 	 	 in 	 to 	 	poverty	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 desperate 	 ly 	 	 search 	 ing 	 	and	they	're	 desperate 	 ly 	 	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	the	little	bit	of	 saving 	 s 	 	that	they	have	,	 try 	 ing 	 	in	 va 	 in 	 	to	find	a	cure	for	 the 	 ir 	 	children	.
we	think	children	deserve	better	.
and	so	when	the	going	got	 re 	 ally 	 	tough	in	the	 poli 	 o 	 	 eradic 	 ation 	 	program	about	two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	when	people	 we 	 re 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	we	should	call	it	off	,	``	the	 poli 	 o 	 	 partner 	 ship 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	to	 buck 	 le 	 	down	once	 aga 	 in 	 	and	try	and	find	 innov 	 ative 	 	new	 solution 	 s 	 	,	new	ways	to	get	to	the	children	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	.
in	 north 	 ern 	 	india	,	we	 start 	 ed 	 	mapping	the	 case 	 s 	 	using	satellite	 im 	 aging 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	so	that	we	could	guide	our	 invest 	 ments 	 	and	 vaccin 	 ator 	 	 shelter 	 s 	 	,	so	we	could	get	to	the	 million 	 s 	 	of	children	on	the	koshi	river	basin	where	there	are	no	other	health	 service 	 s 	 	.
in	 north 	 ern 	 	nigeria	,	the	 politic 	 al 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	and	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	muslim	 lead 	 ers 	 	,	they	got	 direct 	 ly 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	the	program	to	help	solve	the	 problem 	 s 	 	of	 logist 	 ic 	 s 	 	and	community	confidence	.
and	now	they	've	even	 start 	 ed 	 	using	these	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	--	 s 	 peaking 	 	of	cool	technology	--	these	little	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	,	little	gis	 track 	 ers 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	which	they	put	 in 	 to 	 	the	 vaccin 	 e 	 	 car 	 rier 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 vaccin 	 ators 	 	.
and	then	they	can	track	them	,
and	at	the	end	of	the	day	,	they	look	and	see	,	did	these	 guy 	 s 	 	get	every	single	street	,	every	single	house	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	kind	of	 commit 	 ment 	 	now	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	to	try	and	reach	all	of	the	children	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	.
and	in	afghanistan	,	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	new	 approach 	 es 	 	--	access	 negoti 	 ators 	 	.
we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	 close 	 ly 	 	with	the	 inter 	 national 	 	 commit 	 tee 	 	of	the	red	cross	to	ensure	that	we	can	reach	every	child	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	these	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	people	went	to	 th 	 is 	 	trouble	to	try	and	 re 	 work 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 tactic 	 s 	 	,	we	went	back	to	the	 vaccin 	 e 	 	--	it	's	a	50	-	year	-	old	 vaccin 	 e 	 	--	and	we	thought	,	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	we	can	make	a	better	 vaccin 	 e 	 	,	so	that	when	they	 final 	 ly 	 	get	to	these	 kid 	 s 	 	,	we	can	have	a	better	bang	for	our	buck	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	an	 in 	 credible 	 	 collabor 	 ation 	 	with	industry	,
and	 with 	 in 	 	six	 month 	 s 	 	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 test 	 ing 	 	a	new	 poli 	 o 	 	 vaccin 	 e 	 	that	 target 	 ed 	 	,	just	two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	the	last	two	 type 	 s 	 	of	 poli 	 o 	 	in	the	world	.
now	june	the	 n 	 in 	 th 	 	,	2009	,	we	got	the	first	 result 	 s 	 	from	the	first	trial	with	 th 	 is 	 	 vaccin 	 e 	 	,
and	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	a	game	-	changer	.
the	new	 vaccin 	 e 	 	had	twice	the	impact	on	these	last	couple	of	viruses	 a 	 s 	 	the	old	 vaccin 	 e 	 	had	,
and	we	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	using	 th 	 is 	 	.
well	,	in	a	couple	of	 month 	 s 	 	we	had	to	get	it	out	of	production	.
and	it	 start 	 ed 	 	 roll 	 ing 	 	off	the	production	lines	and	 in 	 to 	 	the	 mouth 	 s 	 	of	children	around	the	world	.
and	we	did	n't	start	with	the	easy	 place 	 s 	 	.
the	first	place	 th 	 is 	 	 vaccin 	 e 	 	was	used	was	in	southern	afghanistan	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	in	 place 	 s 	 	like	that	where	 kid 	 s 	 	are	going	to	benefit	the	most	from	 techno 	 logies 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
now	here	at	ted	,	over	the	last	couple	of	 day 	 s 	 	,	i	've	 s 	 een 	 	people	 challeng 	 ing 	 	the	audience	 aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	to	 believ 	 e 	 	in	the	 im 	 possible 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	at	about	seven	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	,	i	 decide 	 d 	 	that	we	'd	try	to	drive	chris	and	the	production	crew	here	 ber 	 s 	 er 	 k 	 	by	 download 	 ing 	 	all	of	our	data	from	india	 aga 	 in 	 	,	so	that	you	could	see	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	just	 un 	 fold 	 ing 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	which	 prove 	 s 	 	that	the	 im 	 possible 	 	is	possible	.
and	 on 	 ly 	 	two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	people	 we 	 re 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	 im 	 possible 	 	.
now	remember	,	 north 	 ern 	 	india	is	the	perfect	storm	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	 poli 	 o 	 	.
over	500,000	children	are	born	in	the	two	 state 	 s 	 	that	have	never	 stop 	 ped 	 	 poli 	 o 	 	--	uttar	pradesh	and	bihar	--	500,000	children	every	single	month	.
 sanit 	 ation 	 	is	 terr 	 ible 	 	,	and	our	old	 vaccin 	 e 	 	,	you	remember	,	 work 	 ed 	 	half	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	it	should	have	.
and	yet	,	the	 im 	 possible 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	 mark 	 s 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	six	 month 	 s 	 	--	and	for	the	first	time	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	not	a	single	child	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 paralyze 	 d 	 	in	uttar	pradesh	or	bihar	.
india	's	not	 un 	 ique 	 	.
in	umar	's	home	country	of	nigeria	,	a	95	percent	 r 	 eduction 	 	in	the	number	of	children	 paralyze 	 d 	 	by	 poli 	 o 	 	last	year	.
and	in	the	last	six	 month 	 s 	 	,	we	've	had	less	 place 	 s 	 	 re 	 infect 	 ed 	 	by	 poli 	 o 	 	than	at	any	other	time	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	with	a	combination	of	smart	people	,	smart	technology	and	smart	 invest 	 ments 	 	,	 poli 	 o 	 	can	now	be	 eradic 	 ated 	 	 any 	 where 	 	.
we	have	major	 challeng 	 es 	 	,	you	can	imagine	,	to	finish	 th 	 is 	 	job	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	you	've	 al 	 so 	 	 s 	 een 	 	,	it	's	 do 	 able 	 	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	great	 second 	 ary 	 	 benefit 	 s 	 	,	and	 poli 	 o 	 	 eradic 	 ation 	 	is	a	great	buy	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	any	child	 any 	 where 	 	is	 paralyze 	 d 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	virus	,	it	's	a	 star 	 k 	 	 re 	 mind 	 er 	 	that	we	are	 fail 	 ing 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	to	reach	children	with	the	most	 bas 	 ic 	 	of	 service 	 s 	 	.
and	for	that	reason	,	 poli 	 o 	 	 eradic 	 ation 	 	:	it	's	the	ultimate	in	 equ 	 ity 	 	and	it	's	the	ultimate	in	social	justice	.
the	huge	social	 move 	 ment 	 	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 poli 	 o 	 	 eradic 	 ation 	 	is	ready	to	do	way	more	for	these	children	.
it	's	ready	to	reach	them	with	bed	 net 	 s 	 	,	with	other	 thing 	 s 	 	.
but	 capital 	 izing 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 ent 	 husiasm 	 	,	 capital 	 izing 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	energy	 mean 	 s 	 	 finish 	 ing 	 	the	job	that	they	 start 	 ed 	 	20	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
 finish 	 ing 	 	 poli 	 o 	 	is	a	smart	thing	to	do	,	and	it	's	the	right	thing	to	do	.
now	we	're	in	tough	 time 	 s 	 	 economic 	 ally 	 	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	david	cameron	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 king 	 dom 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	about	a	month	ago	when	he	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 poli 	 o 	 	,	``	there	's	never	a	wrong	time	to	do	the	right	thing	.	``	 finish 	 ing 	 	 poli 	 o 	 	 eradic 	 ation 	 	is	the	right	thing	to	do	.
and	we	are	at	a	 cross 	 road 	 s 	 	right	now	in	 th 	 is 	 	great	effort	over	the	last	20	 year 	 s 	 	.
we	have	a	new	 vaccin 	 e 	 	,	we	have	new	 re 	 solve 	 	,	and	we	have	new	 tactic 	 s 	 	.
we	have	the	chance	to	write	an	 entire 	 ly 	 	new	 poli 	 o 	 	-	free	chapter	in	human	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
but	if	we	blink	now	,	we	will	lose	 fore 	 ver 	 	the	chance	to	 eradic 	 ate 	 	an	ancient	disease	.
here	's	a	great	idea	to	spread	:	end	 poli 	 o 	 	now	.
help	us	tell	the	story	.
help	us	build	the	 moment 	 um 	 
so	that	 ver 	 y 	 	soon	every	child	,	every	parent	 every 	 where 	 	can	 al 	 so 	 	take	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	a	 poli 	 o 	 	-	free	life	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
thank	you	.
bill	 gate 	 s 	 	:	well	bruce	,	where	do	you	think	the	 tough 	 est 	 	 place 	 s 	 	are	going	to	be	?
where	would	you	say	we	need	to	be	the	 smart 	 est 	 	?
ba	:	the	four	 place 	 s 	 	where	you	saw	,	that	we	've	never	 stop 	 ped 	 	--	 north 	 ern 	 	nigeria	,	 north 	 ern 	 	india	,	the	southern	corner	of	afghanistan	and	 border 	 ing 	 	 area 	 s 	 	of	pakistan	--	they	're	going	to	be	the	 tough 	 est 	 	.
but	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	is	,	of	 t 	 hose 	 	three	,	india	's	looking	real	good	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	just	saw	in	the	data	.
and	afghanistan	,	afghanistan	,	we	think	 ha 	 s 	 	 prob 	 ably 	 	 stop 	 ped 	 	 poli 	 o 	 	 repeat 	 ed 	 ly 	 	.
it	 keep 	 s 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 re 	 infect 	 ed 	 	.
so	the	tough	 one 	 s 	 	:	going	to	get	the	top	of	nigeria	 finish 	 ed 	 	and	 get 	 ting 	 	pakistan	 finish 	 ed 	 	.
they	're	going	to	be	the	tough	 one 	 s 	 	.
bg	:	now	what	about	the	money	?
give	us	a	sense	of	how	much	the	campaign	 cost 	 s 	 	a	year	.
and	is	it	easy	to	raise	that	money	?
and	what	's	it	going	to	be	like	the	next	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	?
ba	:	it	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
we	 s 	 pend 	 	right	now	about	750	million	to	800	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	.
that	's	what	it	 cost 	 s 	 	to	reach	500	million	children	.
it	 sound 	 s 	 	like	a	lot	of	money	;	it	is	a	lot	of	money	.
but	when	you	're	 reach 	 ing 	 	500	million	children	 multi 	 ple 	 	 time 	 s 	 	--	20	,	30	 cent 	 s 	 	to	reach	a	child	--	that	's	not	 ver 	 y 	 	much	money	.
but	right	now	we	do	n't	have	 en 	 ough 	 	of	that	.
we	have	a	big	gap	in	that	money	.	we	're	cutting	 corner 	 s 	 	,
and	every	time	we	cut	 corner 	 s 	 	,	more	 place 	 s 	 	get	 infect 	 ed 	 	that	should	n't	have	,	and	it	just	 s 	 low 	 s 	 	us	down	.
and	that	great	buy	 cost 	 s 	 	us	a	little	bit	more	.
bg	:	well	,	 hope 	 fully 	 	we	'll	get	the	word	out	,	and	the	 government 	 s 	 	will	keep	 the 	 ir 	 	 gene 	 ros 	 ity 	 	up	.
so	good	luck	.	we	're	all	in	 th 	 is 	 	with	you	.
thank	you	.
