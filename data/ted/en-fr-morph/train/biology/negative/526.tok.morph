it	 confer 	 s 	 	on	us	the	ability	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	that	we	ca	n't	do	 to 	 day 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	that	we	could	n't	do	 yester 	 day 	 	.
and	of	course	it	's	born	stupid	.
the	last	time	you	 we 	 re 	 	in	the	presence	of	a	baby	--	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	to	be	my	 grand 	 daughter 	 	,	mitra	.
is	n't	she	fabulous	?
but	 non 	 e 	 the 	 less 	 	when	she	 pop 	 ped 	 	out	 de 	 spite 	 	the	fact	that	her	brain	had	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 progress 	 ing 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	for	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 month 	 s 	 	before	on	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	her	 experience 	 s 	 	in	the	womb	--

if	we	 we 	 re 	 	to	assay	her	 per 	 cept 	 ual 	 	abilities	,	they	would	be	 crud 	 e 	 	.
there	is	no	real	 indic 	 ation 	 	that	there	is	any	real	 think 	 ing 	 	going	on	.
in	fact	there	is	little	evidence	that	there	is	any	cognitive	ability	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	young	infant	.
 infant 	 s 	 	do	n't	respond	to	much	.
there	is	not	 re 	 ally 	 	much	of	an	 indic 	 ation 	 	in	fact	that	there	is	a	person	on	board	.
and	they	can	 on 	 ly 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	primitive	way	,	and	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 limit 	 ed 	 	way	control	 the 	 ir 	 	 move 	 ments 	 	.
it	would	be	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 month 	 s 	 	before	 th 	 is 	 	infant	could	do	 some 	 thing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	simple	 a 	 s 	 	reach	out	and	grasp	under	voluntary	control	an	object	and	retrieve	it	,	 usual 	 ly 	 	to	the	mouth	.
and	it	will	be	some	 month 	 s 	 	 before 	 ward 	 	,	and	we	see	a	long	 stead 	 y 	 	 progress 	 ion 	 	of	the	evolution	from	the	first	 wig 	 gle 	 s 	 	,	to	 roll 	 ing 	 	over	,	and	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	up	,	and	 crawl 	 ing 	 	,	 stand 	 ing 	 	,	 walk 	 ing 	 	,	before	we	get	to	that	 magic 	 al 	 	point	in	which	we	can	 mot 	 ate 	 	in	the	world	.
and	yet	,	when	we	look	forward	in	the	brain	we	see	 re 	 ally 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	advance	.
by	 th 	 is 	 	age	the	brain	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	store	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	 store 	 d 	 	,	 record 	 ed 	 	,	can	 fast 	 ly 	 	retrieve	the	 meaning 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	,	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 object 	 s 	 	,	 action 	 s 	 	,	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 relationship 	 s 	 	in	the	world	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	 relationship 	 s 	 	can	in	fact	be	 construct 	 ed 	 	in	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	,	 potential 	 ly 	 	 million 	 s 	 	of	ways	.
by	 th 	 is 	 	age	the	brain	 control 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 refine 	 d 	 	 per 	 cept 	 ual 	 	abilities	.
and	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	growing	repertoire	of	cognitive	 skill 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	brain	is	 ver 	 y 	 	much	a	 think 	 ing 	 	machine	.
and	by	 th 	 is 	 	age	there	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	no	question	that	 th 	 is 	 	brain	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	person	on	board	.
and	in	fact	at	 th 	 is 	 	age	it	is	 sub 	 stantial 	 ly 	 	 controll 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	own	self	-	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
and	by	 th 	 is 	 	age	we	see	a	 remark 	 able 	 	evolution	in	 it 	 s 	 	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	control	 move 	 ment 	 	.
now	 move 	 ment 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 advance 	 d 	 	to	the	point	where	it	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	control	 move 	 ment 	 	 simultaneous 	 ly 	 	,	in	a	complex	sequence	,	in	complex	ways	 a 	 s 	 	would	be	 requir 	 ed 	 	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	for	 play 	 ing 	 	a	 complic 	 ated 	 	game	,	like	soccer	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	boy	can	 bounc 	 e 	 	a	soccer	ball	on	his	head	.
and	where	 th 	 is 	 	boy	 come 	 s 	 	from	,	sao	paulo	,	brazil	,	about	40	percent	of	 boy 	 s 	 	of	his	age	have	 th 	 is 	 	ability	.
you	could	go	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	community	in	monterey	,	and	you	'd	have	 difficult 	 y 	 	 find 	 ing 	 	a	boy	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	ability	.
and	if	you	did	he	'd	 prob 	 ably 	 	be	from	sao	paulo	.
that	's	all	 an 	 other 	 	way	of	 say 	 ing 	 	that	our	individual	 skill 	 s 	 	and	abilities	are	 ver 	 y 	 	much	shaped	by	our	 environment 	 s 	 	.
that	environment	 extend 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	our	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	culture	,	the	thing	our	brain	is	 challeng 	 ed 	 	with	.
 be 	 cause 	 	what	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	in	our	personal	 evolution 	 s 	 	is	build	up	a	large	repertoire	of	specific	 skill 	 s 	 	and	abilities	that	are	specific	to	our	own	individual	 histo 	 ries 	 	.
and	in	fact	they	result	in	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 different 	 iation 	 	in	 human 	 kind 	 	,
in	the	way	that	,	in	fact	,	no	two	of	us	are	 quit 	 e 	 	 a 	 like 	 	.
every	one	of	us	 ha 	 s 	 	a	different	set	of	 acquir 	 ed 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	and	abilities	that	all	 der 	 ive 	 	out	of	the	 plastic 	 ity 	 	,	the	 adapt 	 ability 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	 adapt 	 ive 	 	machine	.
in	an	adult	brain	of	course	we	've	built	up	a	large	repertoire	of	 master 	 ed 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	and	abilities	that	we	can	perform	more	or	less	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	from	 memor 	 y 	 	,	and	that	define	us	 a 	 s 	 	 act 	 ing 	 	,	moving	,	 think 	 ing 	 	 creature 	 s 	 	.
now	we	 stud 	 y 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	 nerd 	 y 	 	,	 labor 	 atory 	 	,	university	-	based	 scientist 	 s 	 	that	we	are	,	by	 engag 	 ing 	 	the	 brain 	 s 	 	of	 animal 	 s 	 	like	 rat 	 s 	 	,	or	 monkey 	 s 	 	,	or	of	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 cur 	 ious 	 	creature	--	one	of	the	more	bizarre	 form 	 s 	 	of	life	on	earth	--	to	engage	them	in	 learn 	 ing 	 	new	 skill 	 s 	 	and	abilities	.
and	we	try	to	track	the	 change 	 s 	 	that	occur	 a 	 s 	 	the	new	skill	or	ability	is	 acquir 	 ed 	 	.
in	fact	we	do	 th 	 is 	 	in	 individual 	 s 	 	of	any	age	,	in	these	different	species	--
that	is	to	say	from	 inf 	 ancies 	 	,	 inf 	 ancy 	 	up	to	 adult 	 hood 	 	and	old	age	.
so	we	might	engage	a	rat	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	to	 acquir 	 e 	 	a	new	skill	or	ability	that	might	involve	the	rat	using	 it 	 s 	 	paw	to	master	 part 	 icular 	 	manual	grasp	 behavior 	 s 	 	just	like	we	might	examine	a	child	and	 the 	 ir 	 	ability	to	 acquir 	 e 	 	the	sub	-	 skill 	 s 	 	,	or	the	general	 over 	 all 	 	skill	of	 accomplish 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 master 	 ing 	 	the	ability	to	read	.
or	you	might	look	in	an	 old 	 er 	 	individual	who	 ha 	 s 	 	 master 	 ed 	 	a	complex	set	of	abilities	that	might	 re 	 late 	 	to	 read 	 ing 	 	musical	 not 	 ation 	 	or	 perform 	 ing 	 	the	 mechanic 	 al 	 	 act 	 s 	 	of	performance	that	 app 	 ly 	 	to	musical	performance	.
from	these	 stud 	 ies 	 	we	defined	two	great	 epoch 	 s 	 	of	the	plastic	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	the	brain	.
the	first	great	epoch	is	 common 	 ly 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	``	critical	period	.	``
and	that	is	the	period	in	which	the	brain	is	setting	up	in	 it 	 s 	 	 initi 	 al 	 	form	 it 	 s 	 	 bas 	 ic 	 	 process 	 ing 	 	 machine 	 ry 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	period	of	 dramat 	 ic 	 	change	in	which	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	take	 learn 	 ing 	 	,	per	 s 	 e 	 	,	to	drive	the	 initi 	 al 	 	 different 	 iation 	 	of	the	 machine 	 ry 	 	of	the	brain	.
all	it	 take 	 s 	 	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	in	the	sound	domain	,	is	 expo 	 s 	 ure 	 	to	sound	.
and	the	brain	 actual 	 ly 	 	is	at	the	 merc 	 y 	 	of	the	sound	environment	in	which	it	is	 rear 	 ed 	 	.
so	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	i	can	rear	an	animal	in	an	environment	in	which	there	is	 meaning 	 less 	 	dumb	sound	,
a	repertoire	of	sound	that	i	make	up	,
that	i	make	,	just	by	 expo 	 s 	 ure 	 	,	 artificial 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	the	animal	and	 it 	 s 	 	young	brain	.
and	what	i	see	is	that	the	animal	's	brain	 set 	 s 	 	up	 it 	 s 	 	 initi 	 al 	 	 process 	 ing 	 	of	that	sound	in	a	form	that	's	 ideal 	 ized 	 	,	 with 	 in 	 	the	 limit 	 s 	 	of	 it 	 s 	 	 process 	 ing 	 	 achiev 	 ement 	 s 	 	to	represent	it	in	an	 organize 	 d 	 	and	 order 	 ly 	 	way	.
the	sound	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	to	be	 valu 	 able 	 	to	the	animal	:
i	could	raise	the	animal	in	 some 	 thing 	 	that	could	be	 hypothetical 	 ly 	 	 valu 	 able 	 	,	like	the	 sound 	 s 	 	that	 simul 	 ate 	 	the	 sound 	 s 	 	of	a	native	language	of	a	child	.
and	i	see	the	brain	 actual 	 ly 	 	develop	a	processor	that	is	 special 	 ized 	 	--
 special 	 ized 	 	for	that	complex	array	,	a	repertoire	of	 sound 	 s 	 	.
it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 exagge 	 rates 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 separat 	 e 	 ness 	 	of	 represent 	 ation 	 	,	in	multi	-	dimensional	 neuro 	 nal 	 	 represent 	 ation 	 al 	 	 term 	 s 	 	.
or	i	can	 ex 	 pose 	 	the	animal	to	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	 meaning 	 less 	 	and	 destruct 	 ive 	 	sound	.
i	can	raise	an	animal	under	 condition 	 s 	 	that	would	be	 equi 	 valent 	 	to	raising	a	baby	under	a	 moderate 	 ly 	 	loud	 ceil 	 ing 	 	fan	,	in	the	presence	of	 continu 	 ous 	 	noise	.
and	when	i	do	that	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	 special 	 ize 	 	the	brain	to	be	a	master	processor	for	that	 meaning 	 less 	 	sound	.
and	i	 frust 	 rate 	 	 it 	 s 	 	ability	to	represent	any	 meaning 	 ful 	 	sound	 a 	 s 	 	a	 con 	 sequence 	 	.
 s 	 uch 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	in	the	early	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 bab 	 ies 	 	occur	in	real	 bab 	 ies 	 	.
and	they	account	for	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	the	 beaut 	 iful 	 	evolution	of	a	language	-	specific	processor	in	every	 normal 	 ly 	 	 develop 	 ing 	 	baby	.
and	so	they	 al 	 so 	 	account	for	 develop 	 ment 	 	of	 defect 	 ive 	 	 process 	 ing 	 	in	a	 sub 	 stantial 	 	population	of	children	who	are	more	 limit 	 ed 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 con 	 sequence 	 	,	in	 the 	 ir 	 	language	abilities	at	an	 old 	 er 	 	age	.
now	in	 th 	 is 	 	early	period	of	 plastic 	 ity 	 	the	brain	 actual 	 ly 	 	 change 	 s 	 	 out 	 side 	 	of	a	 learn 	 ing 	 	 con 	 text 	 	.
i	do	n't	have	to	be	 pay 	 ing 	 	attention	to	what	i	hear	.
the	 in 	 put 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	have	to	be	 meaning 	 ful 	 	.
i	do	n't	have	to	be	in	a	 behavior 	 al 	 	 con 	 text 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 requir 	 ed 	 	so	the	brain	 set 	 s 	 	up	it	's	 process 	 ing 	 	so	that	it	can	act	 different 	 i 	 ally 	 	,	so	that	it	can	act	 select 	 ively 	 	,	so	that	the	creature	that	 wear 	 s 	 	it	,	that	 car 	 ries 	 	it	,	can	begin	to	 oper 	 ate 	 	on	it	in	a	 select 	 ive 	 	way	.
in	the	next	great	epoch	of	life	,	which	 appli 	 es 	 	for	most	of	life	,	the	brain	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 re 	 fin 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 machine 	 ry 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	 master 	 s 	 	a	wide	repertoire	of	 skill 	 s 	 	and	abilities	.
and	in	 th 	 is 	 	epoch	,	which	 extend 	 s 	 	from	late	in	the	first	year	of	life	to	death	;
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	under	 behavior 	 al 	 	control	.
and	that	's	 an 	 other 	 	way	of	 say 	 ing 	 	the	brain	 ha 	 s 	 	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	that	define	the	 sign 	 ific 	 ance 	 	of	the	 in 	 put 	 	to	the	brain	.
and	it	's	 focus 	 ing 	 	on	skill	after	skill	,	or	ability	after	ability	,	under	specific	 attention 	 al 	 	control	.
it	's	a	function	of	 whet 	 her 	 	a	goal	in	a	behavior	is	 achiev 	 ed 	 	or	 whet 	 her 	 	the	individual	is	 reward 	 ed 	 	in	the	behavior	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 life 	 long 	 	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	for	 plastic 	 ity 	 	,	for	brain	change	,	is	 power 	 fully 	 	 express 	 ed 	 	.
it	is	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	our	real	 different 	 iation 	 	,	one	individual	from	 an 	 other 	 	.
you	can	look	down	in	the	brain	of	an	animal	that	's	 engag 	 ed 	 	in	a	specific	skill	,	and	you	can	witness	or	document	 th 	 is 	 	change	on	a	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 level 	 s 	 	.
so	here	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	experiment	.
it	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 conduct 	 ed 	 	about	five	 year 	 s 	 	ago	in	 collabor 	 ation 	 	with	 scientist 	 s 	 	from	the	university	of	provence	in	marseilles	.
it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	experiment	where	a	monkey	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	trained	in	a	task	that	 involve 	 s 	 	it	 manipul 	 ating 	 	a	tool	that	's	 equi 	 valent 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	 difficult 	 y 	 	to	a	child	 learn 	 ing 	 	to	 manipul 	 ate 	 	or	handle	a	spoon	.
the	monkey	 actual 	 ly 	 	 master 	 ed 	 	the	task	in	about	700	practice	tries	.
so	in	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	the	monkey	could	not	perform	 th 	 is 	 	task	at	all	.
it	had	a	success	rate	of	about	one	in	eight	tries	.
 t 	 hose 	 	tries	 we 	 re 	 	elaborate	.
each	attempt	was	 sub 	 stantial 	 ly 	 	different	from	the	other	.
but	the	monkey	 gradu 	 ally 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	.
and	700	or	so	tries	 lat 	 er 	 	the	monkey	is	 perform 	 ing 	 	it	 flaw 	 lessly 	 	--	never	 fail 	 s 	 	.
he	's	 success 	 ful 	 	in	his	 retr 	 ieval 	 	of	food	with	 th 	 is 	 	tool	every	time	.
at	 th 	 is 	 	point	the	task	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 perform 	 ed 	 	in	a	 beaut 	 i 	 fully 	 	 stereo 	 type 	 d 	 	way	:
 ver 	 y 	 	 beaut 	 i 	 fully 	 	 regulat 	 ed 	 	and	 high 	 ly 	 	 repeat 	 ed 	 	,	trial	to	trial	.
we	can	look	down	in	the	brain	of	the	monkey	.
and	we	see	that	it	's	 distort 	 ed 	 	.
we	can	track	these	 change 	 s 	 	,	and	have	 track 	 ed 	 	these	 change 	 s 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 behavior 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	time	.
and	here	we	see	the	 distort 	 ion 	 	 reflect 	 ed 	 	in	the	map	of	the	skin	 surface 	 s 	 	of	the	hand	of	the	monkey	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	map	,	down	in	the	surface	of	the	brain	,	in	which	,	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	elaborate	experiment	we	've	 re 	 construct 	 ed 	 	the	 respons 	 es 	 	,	location	by	location	,	in	a	 high 	 ly 	 	 detail 	 ed 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	mapping	of	the	 respons 	 es 	 	of	 it 	 s 	 	 neuro 	 ns 	 	.
we	see	here	a	 re 	 construction 	 	of	how	the	hand	is	 represent 	 ed 	 	in	the	brain	.
we	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	 distort 	 ed 	 	the	map	by	the	 exercis 	 e 	 	.
and	that	is	 indic 	 ated 	 	in	the	pink	.	we	have	a	couple	 finger 	 tip 	 	 surface 	 s 	 	that	are	 large 	 r 	 	.
these	are	the	 surface 	 s 	 	the	monkey	is	using	to	 manipul 	 ate 	 	the	tool	.
if	we	look	at	the	 select 	 ivity 	 	of	 respons 	 es 	 	in	the	cortex	of	the	monkey	,	we	see	that	the	monkey	 ha 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 change 	 d 	 	the	filter	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	which	 represent 	 s 	 	 in 	 put 	 	from	the	skin	of	the	 finger 	 tip 	 s 	 	that	are	 engag 	 ed 	 	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	there	is	still	a	single	,	simple	 represent 	 ation 	 	of	the	 finger 	 tip 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	most	 organize 	 d 	 	of	 cort 	 ical 	 	 area 	 s 	 	of	the	surface	of	the	skin	of	the	body	.
monkey	 ha 	 s 	 	like	you	have	.
and	yet	now	it	's	 represent 	 ed 	 	in	 sub 	 stantial 	 ly 	 	 fin 	 er 	 	grain	.
the	monkey	is	 get 	 ting 	 	more	 detail 	 ed 	 	information	from	these	 surface 	 s 	 	.
and	that	is	an	 un 	 known 	 	--	 un 	 suspect 	 ed 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	,	by	you	--	part	of	 acquir 	 ing 	 	the	skill	or	ability	.
now	 actual 	 ly 	 	we	've	 look 	 ed 	 	in	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	different	 cort 	 ical 	 	 area 	 s 	 	in	the	monkey	 learn 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	task	.
and	each	one	of	them	 change 	 s 	 	in	ways	that	are	specific	to	the	skill	or	ability	.
so	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	we	can	look	to	the	 cort 	 ical 	 	area	that	 represent 	 s 	 	 in 	 put 	 	that	's	 controll 	 ing 	 	the	 post 	 ure 	 	of	the	monkey	.
we	look	in	 cort 	 ical 	 	 area 	 s 	 	that	control	specific	 move 	 ments 	 	,	and	the	 sequence 	 s 	 	of	 move 	 ments 	 	that	are	 requir 	 ed 	 	in	the	behavior	,	and	so	forth	.
they	are	all	 re 	 model 	 ed 	 	.	they	all	 be 	 come 	 	 special 	 ized 	 	for	the	task	at	hand	.
there	are	15	or	20	 cort 	 ical 	 	 area 	 s 	 	that	are	 change 	 d 	 	 specific 	 ally 	 	when	you	learn	a	simple	skill	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	that	 represent 	 s 	 	in	your	brain	,	 re 	 ally 	 	massive	change	.
it	 represent 	 s 	 	the	change	in	a	 reli 	 able 	 	way	of	the	 respons 	 es 	 	of	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	,	possibly	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	 neuro 	 ns 	 	in	your	brain	.

 th 	 is 	 	is	 construct 	 ed 	 	by	physical	change	.
and	the	level	of	construction	that	 occur 	 s 	 	is	massive	.
think	about	the	 change 	 s 	 	that	occur	in	the	brain	of	a	child	through	the	course	of	 acquir 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	behavior	abilities	in	general	.
or	 acquir 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	native	language	abilities	.
the	 change 	 s 	 	are	massive	.
what	it	's	all	about	is	the	 select 	 ive 	 	 represent 	 ations 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 import 	 ant 	 	to	the	brain	.
 be 	 cause 	 	in	most	of	the	life	of	the	brain	 th 	 is 	 	is	under	control	of	 behavior 	 al 	 	 con 	 text 	 	.
it	's	what	you	pay	attention	to	.
it	's	what	's	 reward 	 ing 	 	to	you	.
it	's	what	the	brain	 regard 	 s 	 	,	 it 	 self 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	positive	and	 import 	 ant 	 	to	you	.
it	's	all	about	 cort 	 ical 	 	 process 	 ing 	 	and	 fore 	 brain 	 	 special 	 ization 	 	.
and	that	 under 	 lies 	 	your	 special 	 ization 	 	.
that	is	why	you	,	in	your	 man 	 y 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	and	abilities	,	are	a	 un 	 ique 	 	 special 	 ist 	 	:
a	 special 	 ist 	 	that	's	 vast 	 ly 	 	different	in	your	physical	brain	in	detail	than	the	brain	of	an	individual	100	 year 	 s 	 	ago	;
 enormous 	 ly 	 	different	in	the	 detail 	 s 	 	from	the	brain	of	the	average	individual	1,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
now	,	one	of	the	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	change	process	is	that	information	is	 al 	 ways 	 	related	to	other	 in 	 put 	 s 	 	or	information	that	is	 occur 	 ring 	 	in	 im 	 mediate 	 	time	,	in	 con 	 text 	 	.
and	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	the	brain	is	 construct 	 ing 	 	 represent 	 ations 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 correlate 	 d 	 	in	little	 moment 	 s 	 	of	time	and	that	 re 	 late 	 	to	one	 an 	 other 	 	in	little	 moment 	 s 	 	of	 success 	 ive 	 	time	.
the	brain	is	 record 	 ing 	 	all	information	and	 driv 	 ing 	 	all	change	in	temporal	 con 	 text 	 	.
now	 overwhelm 	 ing 	 ly 	 	the	most	 power 	 ful 	 	 con 	 text 	 	that	's	 occur 	 red 	 	in	your	brain	is	you	.
 billion 	 s 	 	of	 event 	 s 	 	have	 occur 	 red 	 	in	your	 histo 	 ry 	 	that	are	related	in	time	to	 your 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 receiv 	 er 	 	,	or	 your 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 a 	 ctor 	 	,	 your 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 think 	 er 	 	,	 your 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 m 	 over 	 	.
 billion 	 s 	 	of	 time 	 s 	 	little	 piece 	 s 	 	of	 sens 	 ation 	 	have	come	in	from	the	surface	of	your	body	that	are	 al 	 ways 	 	 associate 	 d 	 	with	you	 a 	 s 	 	the	 receiv 	 er 	 	,	and	that	result	in	the	 embodi 	 ment 	 	of	you	.
you	are	 construct 	 ed 	 	,	your	self	is	 construct 	 ed 	 	from	these	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 event 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 construct 	 ed 	 	.	it	's	 create 	 d 	 	in	your	brain	.
and	it	's	 create 	 d 	 	in	the	brain	via	physical	change	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 marvel 	 ously 	 	 construct 	 ed 	 	thing	that	 result 	 s 	 	in	individual	form	 be 	 cause 	 	each	one	of	us	 ha 	 s 	 	 vast 	 ly 	 	different	 histo 	 ries 	 	,
and	 vast 	 ly 	 	different	 experience 	 s 	 	,	that	drive	in	to	us	 th 	 is 	 	 marvel 	 ous 	 	 different 	 iation 	 	of	self	,	of	 person 	 hood 	 	.
now	we	've	used	 th 	 is 	 	research	to	try	to	understand	not	just	how	a	normal	person	 develop 	 s 	 	,	and	 elaborate 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	and	abilities	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	try	to	understand	the	 origin 	 s 	 	of	 impair 	 ment 	 	,	and	the	 origin 	 s 	 	of	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	or	 vari 	 ations 	 	that	might	limit	the	 cap 	 a 	 cities 	 	of	a	child	,	or	an	adult	.
i	'm	going	to	talk	about	using	these	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	design	brain	 plastic 	 ity 	 	-	based	approach	to	drive	 correct 	 ions 	 	in	the	 machine 	 ry 	 	of	a	child	that	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	the	 compete 	 nce 	 	of	the	child	 a 	 s 	 	a	language	 receiv 	 er 	 	and	user	and	,	 there 	 after 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 read 	 er 	 	.
and	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	 experiment 	 s 	 	that	involve	 actual 	 ly 	 	using	 th 	 is 	 	brain	science	,
first	of	all	to	understand	how	it	 con 	 tribute 	 s 	 	to	the	loss	of	function	 a 	 s 	 	we	age	.
and	then	,	by	using	it	in	a	 target 	 ed 	 	approach	we	're	going	to	try	to	 different 	 iate 	 	the	 machine 	 ry 	 	to	 re 	 cover 	 	function	in	old	age	.
so	the	first	 ex 	 ample 	 	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	 relat 	 es 	 	to	children	with	 learn 	 ing 	 	 impair 	 ments 	 	.
we	now	have	a	large	body	of	 liter 	 ature 	 	that	 demonst 	 rates 	 	that	the	fundamental	problem	that	 occur 	 s 	 	in	the	 major 	 ity 	 	of	children	that	have	early	language	 impair 	 ments 	 	,	and	that	are	going	to	struggle	to	learn	to	read	,	is	that	 the 	 ir 	 	language	processor	is	 create 	 d 	 	in	a	 defect 	 ive 	 	form	.
and	the	reason	that	it	 rise 	 s 	 	in	a	 defect 	 ive 	 	form	is	 be 	 cause 	 	early	in	the	baby	's	brain	's	life	the	machine	process	is	noisy	.
it	's	that	simple	.
it	's	a	signal	-	to	-	noise	problem	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
and	there	are	a	lot	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 con 	 tribute 	 	to	that	.
there	are	 nume 	 r 	 ous 	 	 inherit 	 ed 	 	 fault 	 s 	 	that	could	make	the	machine	process	noisier	.
now	i	might	say	the	noise	problem	could	 al 	 so 	 	occur	on	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	information	 provide 	 d 	 	in	the	world	from	the	 ear 	 s 	 	.
if	any	--	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	are	 old 	 er 	 	in	the	audience	know	that	when	i	was	a	child	we	 under 	 stood 	 	that	a	child	born	with	a	 c 	 left 	 	 pal 	 ate 	 	was	born	with	what	we	 call 	 ed 	 	mental	 retard 	 ation 	 	.
we	 k 	 new 	 	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	be	 s 	 low 	 	 cognitive 	 ly 	 	;
we	 k 	 new 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	struggle	to	learn	to	develop	normal	language	abilities	;
and	we	 k 	 new 	 	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	struggle	to	learn	to	read	.
most	of	them	would	be	intellectual	and	academic	 failure 	 s 	 	.
that	's	 disappear 	 ed 	 	.	that	no	 long 	 er 	 	 appli 	 es 	 	.
that	 inherit 	 ed 	 	 weak 	 ness 	 	,	that	 inherit 	 ed 	 	condition	 ha 	 s 	 	 evapo 	 rated 	 	.
we	do	n't	hear	about	that	 any 	 more 	 	.	where	did	it	go	?
well	,	it	was	 under 	 stood 	 	by	a	dutch	surgeon	,	about	35	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	that	if	you	 simpl 	 y 	 	fix	the	problem	early	 en 	 ough 	 	,	when	the	brain	is	still	in	 th 	 is 	 	 initi 	 al 	 	plastic	period	so	it	can	set	up	 th 	 is 	 	 machine 	 ry 	 	 ad 	 equate 	 ly 	 	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	 initi 	 al 	 	set	up	time	in	the	critical	period	,	 non 	 e 	 	of	that	 happen 	 s 	 	.
what	are	you	 do 	 ing 	 	by	 oper 	 ating 	 	on	the	 c 	 left 	 	 pal 	 ate 	 	to	correct	it	?
you	're	 bas 	 ically 	 	 open 	 ing 	 	up	the	 tube 	 s 	 	that	drain	fluid	from	the	middle	 ear 	 s 	 	,	which	have	had	them	 reli 	 ably 	 	full	.
every	sound	the	child	 hear 	 s 	 	 un 	 correct 	 ed 	 	is	 muffle 	 d 	 	.
it	's	 de 	 grad 	 ed 	 	.
the	child	's	native	language	is	 s 	 uch 	 	a	case	is	not	english	.
it	's	not	japanese	.
it	's	 muffle 	 d 	 	english	.	it	's	 de 	 grad 	 ed 	 	japanese	.
it	's	crap	.
and	the	brain	 special 	 ize 	 s 	 	for	it	.
it	 create 	 s 	 	a	 represent 	 ation 	 	of	language	crap	.
and	then	the	child	is	 s 	 tuck 	 	with	it	.
now	the	crap	 do 	 es 	 	n't	just	happen	in	the	ear	.
it	can	 al 	 so 	 	happen	in	the	brain	.
the	brain	 it 	 self 	 	can	be	noisy	.	it	's	 common 	 ly 	 	noisy	.
there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 inherit 	 ed 	 	 fault 	 s 	 	that	can	make	it	noisier	.
and	the	native	language	for	a	child	with	 s 	 uch 	 	a	brain	is	 de 	 grad 	 ed 	 	.
it	's	not	english	.	it	's	noisy	english	.
and	that	 result 	 s 	 	in	 defect 	 ive 	 	 represent 	 ations 	 	of	 sound 	 s 	 	of	 word 	 s 	 	--	not	normal	--	a	different	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	,	by	a	machine	that	 ha 	 s 	 	different	time	 constant 	 s 	 	and	different	space	 constant 	 s 	 	.
and	you	can	look	in	the	brain	of	 s 	 uch 	 	a	child	and	record	 t 	 hose 	 	time	 constant 	 s 	 	.
they	are	about	an	order	of	 magn 	 itude 	 	 long 	 er 	 	,	about	11	 time 	 s 	 	 long 	 er 	 	in	 dur 	 ation 	 	on	average	,	than	in	a	normal	child	.
space	 constant 	 s 	 	are	about	three	 time 	 s 	 	 great 	 er 	 	.
 s 	 uch 	 	a	child	will	have	 memor 	 y 	 	and	cognitive	 defici 	 ts 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	domain	.
of	course	they	will	.	 be 	 cause 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 receiv 	 er 	 	of	language	,	they	are	 receiv 	 ing 	 	it	and	 represent 	 ing 	 	it	,
and	in	information	it	's	 represent 	 ing 	 	crap	.
and	they	are	going	to	have	poor	 read 	 ing 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 read 	 ing 	 	is	dependent	 up 	 on 	 	the	 transl 	 ation 	 	of	word	 sound 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 ortho 	 graphic 	 	or	visual	 represent 	 ation 	 al 	 	form	.
if	you	do	n't	have	a	brain	 represent 	 ation 	 	of	word	 sound 	 s 	 	that	 transl 	 ation 	 	 make 	 s 	 	no	sense	.
and	you	are	going	to	have	 correspond 	 ing 	 	 ab 	 normal 	 	 neuro 	 logy 	 	.
then	these	children	 increasing 	 ly 	 	in	 evalu 	 ation 	 	after	 evalu 	 ation 	 	,	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 operation 	 s 	 	in	language	,	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 operation 	 s 	 	in	 read 	 ing 	 	--	we	document	that	 ab 	 normal 	 	 neuro 	 logy 	 	.
the	point	is	is	that	you	can	train	the	brain	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
a	way	to	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	re	-	refine	the	 process 	 ing 	 	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	of	the	 machine 	 ry 	 	by	changing	it	.
changing	it	in	detail	.	it	 take 	 s 	 	about	30	 hour 	 s 	 	on	the	average	.
and	we	've	 accomplish 	 ed 	 	that	in	about	430,000	 kid 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	about	15,000	children	are	 be 	 ing 	 	trained	 a 	 s 	 	we	speak	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	when	you	look	at	the	 impact 	 s 	 	,	the	 impact 	 s 	 	are	 sub 	 stantial 	 	.
so	here	we	're	looking	at	the	normal	 distribut 	 ion 	 	.
what	we	're	most	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	is	these	 kid 	 s 	 	on	the	left	side	of	the	 distribut 	 ion 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	from	about	3,000	children	.
you	can	see	that	most	of	the	children	on	the	left	side	of	the	 distribut 	 ion 	 	are	moving	 in 	 to 	 	the	middle	or	the	right	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	in	a	broad	 assess 	 ment 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	language	abilities	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	like	an	iq	test	for	language	.
the	impact	in	the	 distribut 	 ion 	 	,	if	you	trained	every	child	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	would	be	to	shift	the	whole	 distribut 	 ion 	 	to	the	right	and	narrow	the	 distribut 	 ion 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 sub 	 stantial 	 ly 	 	large	impact	.
think	of	a	 class 	 room 	 	of	children	in	the	language	 art 	 s 	 	.
think	of	the	children	on	the	 s 	 low 	 	side	of	the	class	.
we	have	the	potential	to	move	most	of	 t 	 hose 	 	children	to	the	middle	or	to	the	right	side	.
in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	accurate	language	training	it	 al 	 so 	 	 fix 	 es 	 	 memor 	 y 	 	and	cognition	speech	 flu 	 ency 	 	and	speech	production	.
and	an	 import 	 ant 	 	language	dependent	skill	is	enabled	by	 th 	 is 	 	training	--	that	is	to	say	 read 	 ing 	 	.
and	to	a	large	 ex 	 tent 	 	it	 fix 	 es 	 	the	brain	.
you	can	look	down	in	the	brain	of	a	child	in	a	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 task 	 s 	 	that	 scientist 	 s 	 	have	at	stanford	,	and	mit	,	and	ucsf	,	and	ucla	,	and	a	number	of	other	 institution 	 s 	 	.
and	children	 oper 	 ating 	 	in	 vari 	 ous 	 	language	 behavior 	 s 	 	,	or	in	 vari 	 ous 	 	 read 	 ing 	 	 behavior 	 s 	 	,	you	see	for	the	most	 ex 	 tent 	 	,	for	most	children	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 neuro 	 nal 	 	 respons 	 es 	 	,	 complex 	 ly 	 	 ab 	 normal 	 	before	you	start	,	are	 normal 	 ized 	 	by	the	training	.
now	you	can	 al 	 so 	 	take	the	same	approach	to	address	 problem 	 s 	 	in	aging	.
where	 aga 	 in 	 	the	 machine 	 ry 	 	is	 deterio 	 rating 	 	now	from	 compete 	 nt 	 	 machine 	 ry 	 	,	it	's	going	south	.
noise	is	increasing	in	the	brain	.
and	 learn 	 ing 	 	 modul 	 ation 	 	and	control	is	 deterio 	 rating 	 	.
and	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	look	down	on	the	brain	of	 s 	 uch 	 	an	individual	and	witness	a	change	in	the	time	 constant 	 s 	 	and	space	 constant 	 s 	 	with	which	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	the	brain	is	 represent 	 ing 	 	language	 aga 	 in 	 	.
just	 a 	 s 	 	the	brain	came	out	of	 cha 	 os 	 	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	it	's	going	back	 in 	 to 	 	 cha 	 os 	 	in	the	end	.
 th 	 is 	 	 result 	 s 	 	in	 decline 	 s 	 	in	 memor 	 y 	 	in	cognition	,	and	in	 post 	 ural 	 	ability	and	 ag 	 ility 	 	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	you	can	train	the	brain	of	 s 	 uch 	 	an	individual	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	small	population	of	 s 	 uch 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	--	train	 equal 	 ly 	 	 intensive 	 ly 	 	for	about	30	 hour 	 s 	 	.
these	are	80-	to	90	-	year	-	olds	.
and	what	you	see	are	 sub 	 stantial 	 	 improve 	 ments 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 im 	 mediate 	 	 memor 	 y 	 	,	of	 the 	 ir 	 	ability	to	remember	 thing 	 s 	 	after	a	delay	,	of	 the 	 ir 	 	ability	to	control	 the 	 ir 	 	attention	,	 the 	 ir 	 	language	abilities	and	visual	-	spatial	abilities	.
the	 over 	 all 	 	 neuro 	 psycho 	 logical 	 	index	of	these	trained	 individual 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	population	is	about	two	standard	 dev 	 iation 	 s 	 	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	if	you	 s 	 it 	 	at	the	left	side	of	the	 distribut 	 ion 	 	,	and	i	'm	looking	at	your	 neuro 	 pyscho 	 logical 	 	abilities	,	the	average	person	 ha 	 s 	 	 move 	 d 	 	to	the	middle	or	the	right	side	of	the	 distribut 	 ion 	 	.
it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	most	people	who	are	at	risk	for	 s 	 en 	 ility 	 	,	more	or	less	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	,	are	now	in	a	 protect 	 ed 	 	position	.
my	 issue 	 s 	 	are	to	try	to	get	to	 rescu 	 ing 	 	 old 	 er 	 	 citizen 	 s 	 	more	 complete 	 ly 	 	and	in	 large 	 r 	 	 number 	 s 	 	,
 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	can	be	 d 	 one 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	arena	on	a	vast	scale	--
and	the	same	for	 kid 	 s 	 	.
my	main	interest	is	how	to	elaborate	 th 	 is 	 	science	to	address	other	 mal 	 a 	 dies 	 	.
i	'm	 specific 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 aut 	 ism 	 	,	and	cerebral	 pal 	 s 	 y 	 	,	these	great	 child 	 hood 	 	 catastroph 	 es 	 	.
and	in	 old 	 er 	 	age	 condition 	 s 	 	like	parkinsonism	,	and	in	other	 acquir 	 ed 	 	 impair 	 ments 	 	like	 schizo 	 phrenia 	 	.
your	 issue 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	 relat 	 es 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	science	,	is	how	to	maintain	your	own	high	-	 function 	 ing 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	machine	.
and	of	course	,	a	well	-	 order 	 ed 	 	life	in	which	 learn 	 ing 	 	is	a	 continu 	 ous 	 	part	of	it	,	is	key	.
but	 al 	 so 	 	in	your	future	is	brain	 aero 	 b 	 ic 	 s 	 	.
get	ready	for	it	.	it	's	going	to	be	a	part	of	every	life	not	too	far	in	the	future	,
just	like	physical	 exercis 	 e 	 	is	a	part	of	every	well	 organize 	 d 	 	life	in	the	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	period	.
the	other	way	that	we	will	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	come	to	consider	 th 	 is 	 	 liter 	 ature 	 	and	the	science	that	is	 import 	 ant 	 	to	you	is	in	a	 consider 	 ation 	 	of	how	to	nurture	 your 	 self 	 	.
now	that	you	know	,	now	that	science	is	 tell 	 ing 	 	us	that	you	are	in	charge	,	that	it	's	under	your	control	,	that	your	happiness	,	your	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	,	your	abilities	,	your	 cap 	 a 	 cities 	 	,	are	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 continu 	 ous 	 	 mod 	 ification 	 	,	 continu 	 ous 	 	 improve 	 ment 	 	,	and	you	're	the	 respons 	 ible 	 	agent	and	party	.
of	course	a	lot	of	people	will	 ignor 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 ad 	 vice 	 	.
it	will	be	a	long	time	before	they	 re 	 ally 	 	understand	it	.
now	that	's	 an 	 other 	 	issue	and	not	my	fault	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	thank	you	.
