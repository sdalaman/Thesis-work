i	just	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.

at	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	moment	,	you	are	 view 	 ing 	 	my	upper	half	.
my	lower	half	is	 appear 	 ing 	 	at	a	different	 con 	 ference 	 	in	a	different	country	.
you	can	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	be	in	two	 place 	 s 	 	at	once	.
but	still	,	i	'm	sorry	i	ca	n't	be	with	you	in	person	.
i	'll	explain	at	 an 	 other 	 	time	.
and	 th 	 ough 	 	i	'm	a	rock	star	,	i	just	want	to	assure	you	that	 non 	 e 	 	of	my	 wish 	 es 	 	will	include	a	hot	tub	.
but	what	 re 	 ally 	 	 turn 	 s 	 	me	on	about	technology	is	not	just	the	ability	to	get	more	 song 	 s 	 	on	mp	3	 player 	 s 	 	.
the	revolution	--	 th 	 is 	 	revolution	--	is	much	 big 	 ger 	 	than	that	.
i	hope	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	.
what	 turn 	 s 	 	me	on	about	the	digital	age	,	what	 excit 	 es 	 	me	 personal 	 ly 	 	,	is	that	you	have	closed	the	gap	between	 dream 	 ing 	 	and	 do 	 ing 	 	.
you	 need 	 ed 	 	a	studio	and	a	 produce 	 r 	 	.
now	,	you	need	a	 lap 	 top 	 	.
if	you	 want 	 ed 	 	to	make	a	film	,	you	 need 	 ed 	 	a	mass	of	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	and	a	hollywood	budget	.
now	,	you	need	a	camera	that	 fit 	 s 	 	in	your	palm	,	and	a	couple	of	 buck 	 s 	 	for	a	blank	dvd	.
 imagin 	 ation 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 de 	 couple 	 d 	 	from	the	old	 constraint 	 s 	 	.
and	that	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 es 	 	me	.
i	'm	 excit 	 ed 	 	when	i	 glimps 	 e 	 	that	kind	of	 think 	 ing 	 	writ	large	.
what	i	would	like	to	see	is	 ideal 	 ism 	 	 de 	 couple 	 d 	 	from	all	 constraint 	 s 	 	.	 politic 	 al 	 	,	economic	,	 psycho 	 logical 	 	,	 what 	 ever 	 	.
the	 geo 	 politic 	 al 	 	world	 ha 	 s 	 	got	a	lot	to	learn	from	the	digital	world	.	from	the	ease	with	which	you	 s 	 wept 	 	away	 obstacle 	 s 	 	that	no	one	 k 	 new 	 	could	even	be	 bud 	 ged 	 	.
and	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	what	i	'd	like	to	talk	about	 to 	 day 	 	.
first	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	i	should	 prob 	 ably 	 	explain	why	,	and	how	,	i	got	to	 th 	 is 	 	place	.
it	's	a	journey	that	 start 	 ed 	 	20	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
you	may	remember	that	song	,	``	we	are	the	world	,	``	or	,	``	do	they	know	it	's	christmas	?	``
band	aid	,	live	aid	.
 an 	 other 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	tall	,	 grizz 	 led 	 	rock	star	,	my	friend	 s 	 ir 	 	bob	geldof	,	 issue 	 d 	 	a	 challeng 	 e 	 	to	``	feed	the	world	.	``
it	was	a	great	moment	,	and	it	 utter 	 ly 	 	 change 	 d 	 	my	life	.
that	summer	,	my	wife	,	ali	,	and	 my 	 self 	 	went	to	ethiopia	.
we	went	on	the	quiet	to	see	for	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	what	was	going	on	.
we	lived	in	ethiopia	for	a	month	,	 work 	 ing 	 	at	an	 orphan 	 age 	 	.
the	children	had	a	name	for	me	.
they	 call 	 ed 	 	me	,	``	the	girl	with	the	beard	.	``
do	n't	ask	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	we	found	africa	to	be	a	 magic 	 al 	 	place	.
big	 ski 	 es 	 	,	big	 heart 	 s 	 	,	big	,	 shin 	 ing 	 	continent	.
 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	royal	people	.
 any 	 body 	 	who	ever	 g 	 ave 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	to	africa	got	a	lot	more	back	.
ethiopia	did	n't	just	blow	my	mind	;	it	 open 	 ed 	 	my	mind	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	on	our	last	day	at	 th 	 is 	 	 orphan 	 age 	 	a	man	 hand 	 ed 	 	me	his	baby	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	would	you	take	my	son	with	you	?	``
he	 k 	 new 	 	,	in	ireland	,	that	his	son	would	live	,
and	that	in	ethiopia	,	his	son	would	die	.
it	was	the	middle	of	that	awful	famine	.
well	,	i	 turn 	 ed 	 	him	down	.
and	it	was	a	funny	kind	of	sick	 feel 	 ing 	 	,	but	i	 turn 	 ed 	 	him	down	.
and	it	's	a	 feel 	 ing 	 	i	ca	n't	ever	 quit 	 e 	 	forget	.
and	in	that	moment	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	journey	.
in	that	moment	,	i	 be 	 came 	 	the	worst	thing	of	all	:	i	 be 	 came 	 	a	rock	star	with	a	cause	.
 ex 	 cept 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	the	cause	,	is	it	?
six	-	and	-	a	-	half	thousand	africans	 dy 	 ing 	 	every	single	day	from	 aid 	 s 	 	--	a	 prevent 	 able 	 	,	 treat 	 able 	 	disease	--	for	lack	of	 drug 	 s 	 	we	can	get	in	any	 pharma 	 cy 	 	.
that	's	not	a	cause	.	that	's	an	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	.
11	million	 aid 	 s 	 	 orphan 	 s 	 	in	africa	,
20	million	by	the	end	of	the	decade	.
that	's	not	a	cause	.	that	's	an	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	every	day	,	9,000	more	africans	will	catch	hiv	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 stigma 	 t 	 ization 	 	and	lack	of	education	.
that	's	not	a	cause	.	that	's	an	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	.
so	what	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	here	is	human	 right 	 s 	 	.	the	right	to	live	like	a	human	.
the	right	to	live	,	period	.
and	what	we	're	facing	in	africa	is	an	unprecedented	threat	to	human	dignity	and	 e 	 quality 	 	.
the	next	thing	i	'd	like	to	be	clear	about	is	what	 th 	 is 	 	problem	is	,	and	what	 th 	 is 	 	problem	is	n't	.	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	all	about	 char 	 ity 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	about	justice	.	 re 	 ally 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	about	 char 	 ity 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	about	justice	.
that	's	right	.
and	that	's	too	bad	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	good	at	 char 	 ity 	 	.
americans	,	like	irish	people	,	are	good	at	it	.
even	the	 poor 	 est 	 	 neighbor 	 hood 	 s 	 	give	more	than	they	can	afford	.
we	like	to	give	,	and	we	give	a	lot	.
look	at	the	 respons 	 e 	 	to	the	tsunami	--	it	's	inspiring	.
but	justice	is	a	 tough 	 er 	 	standard	than	 char 	 ity 	 	.
you	see	,	africa	 make 	 s 	 	a	fool	of	our	idea	of	justice	.
it	 make 	 s 	 	a	 far 	 ce 	 	of	our	idea	of	 e 	 quality 	 	.
it	 mock 	 s 	 	our	 pie 	 ties 	 	.	it	 doubt 	 s 	 	our	concern	.
it	 question 	 s 	 	our	 commit 	 ment 	 	.	 be 	 cause 	 	there	is	no	way	we	can	look	at	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	africa	,	and	if	we	're	honest	,	conclude	that	it	would	ever	be	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	happen	 any 	 where 	 	else	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	heard	in	the	film	,	 any 	 where 	 	else	,	not	here	.
not	here	,	not	in	america	,	not	in	europe	.
in	fact	,	a	head	of	state	that	you	're	all	familiar	with	admitted	 th 	 is 	 	to	me	.	and	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	true	.
there	is	no	chance	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 hemorrh 	 aging 	 	of	human	life	would	be	 accept 	 ed 	 	 any 	 where 	 	else	other	than	africa	.
africa	is	a	continent	in	 flame 	 s 	 	.
and	deep	down	,	if	we	 re 	 ally 	 	 accept 	 ed 	 	that	africans	 we 	 re 	 	equal	to	us	,	we	would	all	do	more	to	put	the	fire	out	.
we	're	 stand 	 ing 	 	around	with	 water 	 ing 	 	 can 	 s 	 	,	when	what	we	 re 	 ally 	 	need	is	the	fire	brigade	.
you	see	,	it	's	not	 a 	 s 	 	 dramat 	 ic 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	tsunami	.
it	's	crazy	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	when	you	think	about	it	.
 do 	 es 	 	stuff	have	to	look	like	an	action	movie	these	 day 	 s 	 	to	exist	in	the	front	of	our	brain	?
the	 s 	 low 	 	 extingu 	 ish 	 ing 	 	of	 count 	 less 	 	 live 	 s 	 	is	just	not	 dramat 	 ic 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	it	would	appear	.
 catastroph 	 es 	 	that	we	can	 a 	 vert 	 	are	not	 a 	 s 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 one 	 s 	 	we	could	 a 	 vert 	 	.
funny	,	that	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	that	kind	of	 think 	 ing 	 	 offend 	 s 	 	the	intellectual	rigor	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	.
six	-	and	-	a	-	half	thousand	people	 dy 	 ing 	 	a	day	in	africa	may	be	africa	's	crisis	,	but	the	fact	that	it	's	not	on	the	 night 	 ly 	 	news	,	that	we	in	europe	,	or	you	in	america	,	are	not	 treat 	 ing 	 	it	like	an	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	--	i	want	to	 argu 	 e 	 	with	you	 to 	 night 	 	that	that	's	our	crisis	.
i	want	to	 argu 	 e 	 	that	 th 	 ough 	 	africa	is	not	the	front	line	in	the	war	against	terror	,	it	could	be	soon	.
every	week	,	religious	 extrem 	 ists 	 	take	 an 	 other 	 	african	village	.
they	're	 attempt 	 ing 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	order	to	 cha 	 os 	 	.
well	,	why	are	n't	we	?
poverty	 breed 	 s 	 	despair	.	we	know	 th 	 is 	 	.
despair	 breed 	 s 	 	violence	.	we	know	 th 	 is 	 	.
in	 turbul 	 ent 	 	 time 	 s 	 	,	is	n't	it	 cheap 	 er 	 	,	and	 smart 	 er 	 	,	to	make	 friend 	 s 	 	out	of	potential	 ene 	 mies 	 	than	to	defend	 your 	 self 	 	against	them	 lat 	 er 	 	?
``	the	war	against	terror	is	bound	up	in	the	war	against	poverty	.	``
and	i	did	n't	say	that	.	colin	powell	 s 	 aid 	 	that	.
now	when	the	 militar 	 y 	 	are	 tell 	 ing 	 	us	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	war	that	can	not	be	won	by	 militar 	 y 	 	might	 al 	 one 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	we	should	listen	.
there	's	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	here	,	and	it	's	real	.
it	's	not	spin	.	it	's	not	 wish 	 ful 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	.
the	 problem 	 s 	 	facing	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	afford	us	in	the	 develop 	 ed 	 	world	a	chance	to	re	-	 de 	 scribe 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	the	world	.
we	will	not	 on 	 ly 	 	transform	other	people	's	 live 	 s 	 	,	but	we	will	 al 	 so 	 	transform	the	way	 t 	 hose 	 	other	 live 	 s 	 	see	us	.
and	that	might	be	smart	in	these	nervous	,	 danger 	 ous 	 	 time 	 s 	 	.
do	n't	you	think	that	on	a	 pur 	 e 	 ly 	 	commercial	level	,	that	anti	-	retroviral	 drug 	 s 	 	are	great	 advertise 	 ments 	 	for	western	 ing 	 en 	 u 	 ity 	 	and	technology	?
 do 	 es 	 	n't	 compass 	 ion 	 	look	well	on	us	?
and	let	's	cut	the	crap	for	a	second	.
in	certain	 quarter 	 s 	 	of	the	world	,	brand	eu	,	brand	usa	,	is	not	at	 it 	 s 	 	 shin 	 iest 	 	.
the	 ne 	 on 	 	sign	is	 fizz 	 ing 	 	and	 crack 	 ing 	 	.
 some 	 one 	 	's	put	a	brick	through	the	window	.
the	 region 	 al 	 	branch	 manage 	 rs 	 	are	 get 	 ting 	 	nervous	.
never	before	have	we	in	the	west	 be 	 en 	 	so	 scrutinize 	 d 	 	.
our	 value 	 s 	 	:	do	we	have	any	?
our	 cr 	 ed 	 ibility 	 	?
these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	under	attack	around	the	world	.
brand	usa	could	use	some	 polish 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	say	that	 a 	 s 	 	a	fan	,	you	know	?	 a 	 s 	 	a	person	who	 buy 	 s 	 	the	 product 	 s 	 	.
but	think	about	it	.
more	anti	-	retrovirals	make	sense	.
but	that	's	just	the	easy	part	,	or	ought	to	be	.
but	 e 	 quality 	 	for	africa	--	that	's	a	big	,	expensive	idea	.
you	see	,	the	scale	of	the	 suffer 	 ing 	 	 numb 	 s 	 	us	 in 	 to 	 	a	kind	of	 in 	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
what	on	earth	can	we	all	do	about	 th 	 is 	 	?
well	,	much	more	than	we	think	.
we	ca	n't	fix	every	problem	,	but	the	 one 	 s 	 	we	can	,	i	want	to	 argu 	 e 	 	,	we	must	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	we	can	,	we	must	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	straight	truth	,	the	righteous	truth	.
it	is	not	a	 theor 	 y 	 	.
the	fact	is	that	 our 	 s 	 	is	the	first	generation	that	can	look	disease	and	 extrem 	 e 	 	poverty	in	the	eye	,	look	 a 	 cross 	 	the	ocean	to	africa	,	and	say	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	mean	it	:
we	do	not	have	to	stand	for	 th 	 is 	 	.
a	whole	continent	written	off	--	we	do	not	have	to	stand	for	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	let	me	say	 th 	 is 	 	 with 	 out 	 	a	trace	of	 iron 	 y 	 	--	before	i	back	it	up	to	a	bunch	of	ex	-	 hip 	 pies 	 	.
forget	the	'60s	.	we	can	change	the	world	.
i	ca	n't	;	you	ca	n't	,	 a 	 s 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	;	but	we	can	change	the	world	.
i	 re 	 ally 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	,	the	people	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	.
look	at	the	 gate 	 s 	 	 found 	 ation 	 	.
they	've	 d 	 one 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	stuff	,	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	stuff	.
but	 work 	 ing 	 	together	,	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	change	the	world	.
we	can	turn	the	 inevit 	 able 	 	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	,	and	transform	the	quality	of	life	for	 million 	 s 	 	of	 live 	 s 	 	who	look	and	feel	 ra 	 ther 	 	like	us	,	when	you	're	up	close	.
i	'm	sorry	to	laugh	here	,	but	you	do	look	so	different	than	you	did	in	haight	-	ashbury	in	the	'60s	.
but	i	want	to	 argu 	 e 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	moment	that	you	are	designed	for	.
it	is	the	 flower 	 ing 	 	of	the	 seed 	 s 	 	you	 plant 	 ed 	 	in	 ear 	 lier 	 	,	 head 	 ier 	 	 day 	 s 	 	.
 idea 	 s 	 	that	you	 gest 	 ated 	 	in	your	youth	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 excit 	 es 	 	me	.
 th 	 is 	 	room	was	born	for	 th 	 is 	 	moment	,	is	 re 	 ally 	 	what	i	want	to	say	to	you	 to 	 night 	 	.
most	of	you	 start 	 ed 	 	out	 want 	 ing 	 	to	change	the	world	,	did	n't	you	?
most	of	you	did	,	the	digital	world	.
well	,	now	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	you	,	it	is	possible	to	change	the	physical	world	.
it	's	a	fact	.
 economist 	 s 	 	confirm	it	,	and	they	know	much	more	than	i	do	.
so	why	,	then	,	are	we	not	 pump 	 ing 	 	our	 fist 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	air	?
 prob 	 ably 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	when	we	admit	we	can	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	it	,	we	've	got	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	it	.
it	is	a	pain	in	the	arse	.
 th 	 is 	 	 e 	 quality 	 	business	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	pain	in	the	arse	.
but	for	the	first	time	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	we	have	the	technology	;	we	have	the	know	-	how	;	we	have	the	cash	;	we	have	the	life	-	saving	 drug 	 s 	 	.
do	we	have	the	will	?
i	hope	 th 	 is 	 	is	obvious	,	but	i	'm	not	a	 hip 	 pie 	 	.
and	i	'm	not	 re 	 ally 	 	one	for	the	warm	,	 fuzz 	 y 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	.
i	do	not	have	 flower 	 s 	 	in	my	hair	.	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	come	from	 pun 	 k 	 	rock	.
the	 c 	 lash 	 	 wo 	 re 	 	big	 arm 	 y 	 	 boot 	 s 	 	,	not	 sand 	 al 	 s 	 	.
but	i	know	 tough 	 ness 	 	when	i	see	it	.
and	for	all	the	talk	of	peace	and	love	on	the	west	coast	,	there	was	muscle	to	the	 move 	 ment 	 	that	 start 	 ed 	 	out	here	.
you	see	,	 ideal 	 ism 	 	 detach 	 ed 	 	from	action	is	just	a	dream	.
but	 ideal 	 ism 	 	 all 	 ied 	 	with	 pragmat 	 ism 	 	,	with	 roll 	 ing 	 	up	your	 sleeve 	 s 	 	and	making	the	world	bend	a	bit	,	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	.	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	real	.	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	.
and	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	present	in	a	crowd	like	you	.
last	year	at	data	,	 th 	 is 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	i	 help 	 ed 	 	set	up	,	we	 launch 	 ed 	 	a	campaign	to	summon	 th 	 is 	 	spirit	in	the	fight	against	 aid 	 s 	 	and	 extrem 	 e 	 	poverty	.
we	're	 call 	 ing 	 	it	the	one	campaign	.
it	's	based	on	our	belief	that	the	action	of	one	person	can	change	a	lot	,	but	the	 action 	 s 	 	of	 man 	 y 	 	coming	together	 a 	 s 	 	one	can	change	the	world	.
well	,	we	feel	that	now	is	the	time	to	prove	we	're	right	.
there	are	 moment 	 s 	 	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	when	 civil 	 ization 	 	 re 	 define 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	.
we	 believ 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	.	we	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	could	be	the	time	when	the	world	 final 	 ly 	 	 decide 	 s 	 	that	the	 wan 	 ton 	 	loss	of	life	in	africa	is	just	no	 long 	 er 	 	 accept 	 able 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	could	be	the	time	that	we	 final 	 ly 	 	get	serious	about	changing	the	future	for	most	people	who	live	on	planet	earth	.

 th 	 is 	 	year	is	a	test	for	us	all	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	the	 lead 	 ers 	 	of	the	g	8	 nation 	 s 	 	,	who	 re 	 ally 	 	are	on	the	line	here	,	with	all	the	world	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	.

they	made	some	 re 	 ally 	 	great	 promise 	 s 	 	,	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	 fulfill 	 ed 	 	a	lot	of	them	.
but	some	of	them	they	have	n't	.
they	do	n't	feel	the	push	from	the	ground	,	is	the	truth	.
but	my	 disappoint 	 ment 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	much	more	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	when	i	talk	to	american	people	,	and	i	hear	 the 	 ir 	 	 worri 	 es 	 	about	the	 defici 	 t 	 	,	and	the	 fisc 	 al 	 	well	 be 	 ing 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	country	.	i	understand	that	.
but	there	's	much	more	push	from	the	ground	than	you	'd	think	,	if	we	got	 organize 	 d 	 	.
what	i	try	to	communicate	,	and	you	can	help	me	if	you	agree	,	is	that	aid	for	africa	is	just	great	value	for	money	at	a	time	when	america	 re 	 ally 	 	 need 	 s 	 	it	.
 put 	 ting 	 	it	in	the	 crass 	 est 	 	possible	 term 	 s 	 	,	the	 invest 	 ment 	 	 reap 	 s 	 	huge	 return 	 s 	 	.
not	 on 	 ly 	 	in	 live 	 s 	 	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	,	but	in	 good 	 will 	 	,	 st 	 ability 	 	and	security	that	we	'll	gain	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	hope	that	you	will	do	,	if	i	could	be	so	bold	,	and	not	have	it	 deduct 	 ed 	 	from	my	number	of	 wish 	 es 	 	.
what	i	hope	is	that	beyond	individual	 merci 	 ful 	 	 act 	 s 	 	,	that	you	will	tell	the	 politic 	 ians 	 	to	do	right	by	africa	,	by	america	and	by	the	world	.
give	them	 per 	 mission 	 	,	if	you	like	,	to	 s 	 pend 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 politic 	 al 	 	capital	and	your	financial	capital	,	your	national	 pur 	 s 	 e 	 	on	saving	the	 live 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	people	.
that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	what	i	would	like	you	to	do	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	 al 	 so 	 	need	your	intellectual	capital	:	your	 idea 	 s 	 	,	your	 skill 	 s 	 	,	your	 ing 	 en 	 u 	 ity 	 	.
and	you	,	at	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	,	are	in	a	 un 	 ique 	 	position	.
some	of	the	 techno 	 logies 	 	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	,	you	 invent 	 ed 	 	them	,	or	at	 l 	 east 	 	 revolution 	 ized 	 	the	way	that	they	're	used	.
together	you	have	 change 	 d 	 	the	 zeitge 	 ist 	 	from	analog	to	digital	,	and	 push 	 ed 	 	the	 bound 	 aries 	 	.
and	we	'd	like	you	to	give	us	that	energy	.
give	us	that	kind	of	 dream 	 ing 	 	,	that	kind	of	 do 	 ing 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	say	,	there	're	two	 thing 	 s 	 	on	the	line	here	.
there	's	the	continent	africa	.
but	there	's	 al 	 so 	 	our	sense	of	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
people	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	figure	 th 	 is 	 	out	.
 move 	 ments 	 	are	 spring 	 ing 	 	up	.	 artist 	 s 	 	,	 politic 	 ians 	 	,	pop	 star 	 s 	 	,	 priest 	 s 	 	,	ceos	,	ngos	,	 mother 	 s 	 	'	 un 	 ions 	 	,	student	 un 	 ions 	 	.
a	lot	of	people	are	 get 	 ting 	 	together	,	and	 work 	 ing 	 	under	 th 	 is 	 	 um 	 br 	 ella 	 	i	told	you	about	 ear 	 lier 	 	,	the	one	campaign	.
i	think	they	just	have	one	idea	in	 the 	 ir 	 	mind	,	which	is	,	where	you	live	in	the	world	should	not	determine	 whet 	 her 	 	you	live	in	the	world	.
 histo 	 ry 	 	,	like	god	,	is	 watch 	 ing 	 	what	we	do	.
when	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	 book 	 s 	 	get	written	,	i	think	our	age	will	be	 remember 	 ed 	 	for	three	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 re 	 ally 	 	,	it	's	just	three	 thing 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	whole	age	will	be	 remember 	 ed 	 	for	.
the	digital	revolution	,	 y 	 es 	 	.
the	war	against	terror	,	 y 	 es 	 	.
and	what	we	did	or	did	not	do	to	put	out	the	 fire 	 s 	 	in	africa	.
some	say	we	ca	n't	afford	to	.	i	say	we	ca	n't	afford	not	to	.
thank	you	,	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	my	three	 wish 	 es 	 	.
the	 one 	 s 	 	that	ted	 ha 	 s 	 	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	to	grant	.
you	see	,	if	 th 	 is 	 	is	true	,	and	i	 believ 	 e 	 	it	is	,	that	the	digital	world	you	all	 create 	 d 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 un 	 couple 	 d 	 	the	creative	 imagin 	 ation 	 	from	the	physical	 constraint 	 s 	 	of	matter	,
 th 	 is 	 	should	be	a	piece	of	piss	.
i	should	add	that	 th 	 is 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	out	 a 	 s 	 	a	much	 long 	 er 	 	list	of	 wish 	 es 	 	.
most	of	them	 im 	 possible 	 	,	some	of	them	 im 	 practical 	 	and	one	or	two	of	them	 certain 	 ly 	 	immoral	.
 th 	 is 	 	business	,	it	 get 	 s 	 	to	be	 addict 	 ive 	 	,	you	know	what	i	mean	,	when	 some 	 body 	 	else	is	 pick 	 ing 	 	up	the	tab	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	here	's	number	one	.
i	wish	for	you	to	help	build	a	social	 move 	 ment 	 	of	more	than	one	million	american	 activist 	 s 	 	for	africa	.
that	is	my	first	wish	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	it	's	possible	.
a	few	 minute 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	all	the	 citizen 	 s 	 	'	 campaign 	 s 	 	that	are	 spring 	 ing 	 	up	.
you	know	,	there	's	 lot 	 s 	 	out	there	.
and	with	 th 	 is 	 	one	campaign	 a 	 s 	 	our	 um 	 br 	 ella 	 	,	my	 organ 	 ization 	 	,	data	,	and	other	 group 	 s 	 	,	have	 be 	 en 	 	 tap 	 ping 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	energy	and	the	 ent 	 husiasm 	 	that	's	out	there	from	hollywood	 in 	 to 	 	the	 heart 	 land 	 	of	america	.
we	know	there	's	more	than	 en 	 ough 	 	energy	to	power	 th 	 is 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	.
we	just	need	your	help	in	making	it	happen	.
we	want	all	of	you	here	,	church	america	,	corporate	america	,	 micro 	 soft 	 	america	,	apple	america	,	 co 	 ke 	 	america	,	pepsi	america	,	nerd	america	,	noisy	america	.
we	ca	n't	afford	to	be	cool	and	 s 	 it 	 	 th 	 is 	 	one	out	.
i	do	 believ 	 e 	 	if	we	build	a	 move 	 ment 	 	that	's	one	million	americans	strong	,	we	're	not	going	to	be	 deni 	 ed 	 	.
we	will	have	the	ear	of	congress	.
we	'll	be	the	first	page	in	condi	rice	's	 brief 	 ing 	 	book	,	and	right	 in 	 to 	 	the	 ov 	 al 	 	 off 	 ice 	 	.
if	there	's	one	million	americans	--	and	i	 re 	 ally 	 	know	 th 	 is 	 	--	who	are	ready	to	make	phone	 call 	 s 	 	,	who	are	ready	to	be	on	email	,	i	am	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	that	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	change	the	course	of	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	for	the	continent	of	africa	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	so	i	'd	like	your	help	in	 get 	 ting 	 	that	 sign 	 ed 	 	up	.
i	know	john	gage	and	 s 	 un 	 	microsystems	are	 al 	 ready 	 	on	board	for	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	there	's	 lot 	 s 	 	of	you	we	'd	like	to	talk	to	.
right	,	my	second	wish	,	number	two	.
i	would	like	one	media	hit	for	every	person	on	the	planet	who	is	living	on	less	than	one	dollar	a	day	.
that	's	one	billion	media	 hit 	 s 	 	.
could	be	on	google	,	could	be	on	aol	.	steve	case	,	larry	,	sergey	--	they	've	 d 	 one 	 	a	lot	 al 	 ready 	 	.
it	could	be	nbc	.	it	could	be	abc	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	abc	 to 	 day 	 	about	the	oscars	.
we	have	a	film	,	 produce 	 d 	 	by	jon	kamen	at	radical	media	.
but	you	know	,	we	want	,	we	need	some	 air 	 time 	 	for	our	 idea 	 s 	 	.
we	need	to	get	the	math	;	we	need	to	get	the	 statistic 	 s 	 	out	to	the	american	people	.
i	 re 	 ally 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	old	truman	line	,	that	if	you	give	the	american	people	the	 fact 	 s 	 	,	they	'll	do	the	right	thing	.
and	,	the	other	thing	that	's	 import 	 ant 	 	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	sally	struthers	.
 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 de 	 scribed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	adventure	,	not	a	burden	.
:	one	by	one	they	step	forward	,	a	nurse	,	a	teacher	,	a	 home 	 maker 	 	,	and	 live 	 s 	 	are	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	.
the	problem	is	enormous	.
every	three	 second 	 s 	 	one	person	dies	.
 an 	 other 	 	three	 second 	 s 	 	,	one	more	.
the	 situ 	 ation 	 	is	so	desperate	in	 part 	 s 	 	of	africa	,	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	,	even	america	,	that	aid	 group 	 s 	 	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	they	did	for	the	tsunami	,	are	 unit 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	one	,	 act 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	one	.
we	can	beat	 extrem 	 e 	 	poverty	,	 starv 	 ation 	 	,	 aid 	 s 	 	.
but	we	need	your	help	.
one	more	person	,	letter	,	voice	will	mean	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	life	and	death	for	 million 	 s 	 	of	people	.
 pleas 	 e 	 	join	us	by	 work 	 ing 	 	together	.
americans	have	an	unprecedented	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.	we	can	make	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
we	can	start	to	make	poverty	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
one	,	by	one	,	by	one	.
 pleas 	 e 	 	visit	one	at	 th 	 is 	 	address	.
we	're	not	 ask 	 ing 	 	for	your	money	.	we	're	 ask 	 ing 	 	for	your	voice	.
bono	:	all	right	.	i	wish	for	ted	to	 tru 	 ly 	 	show	the	power	of	information	,
 it 	 s 	 	power	to	 re 	 write 	 	the	 rule 	 s 	 	and	transform	 live 	 s 	 	,	by	 connect 	 ing 	 	every	hospital	,	health	clinic	and	school	in	one	african	country	.
and	i	would	like	it	to	be	ethiopia	.	i	 believ 	 e 	 	we	can	connect	every	school	in	ethiopia	,	every	health	clinic	,	every	hospital	--
we	can	connect	to	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
that	is	my	wish	,	my	third	wish	.
i	think	it	's	possible	.
i	think	we	have	the	money	and	 brain 	 s 	 	in	the	room	to	do	that	.
and	that	would	be	a	mind	-	 blow 	 ing 	 	wish	to	come	true	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	to	ethiopia	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	where	it	all	 start 	 ed 	 	for	me	.
the	idea	that	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	which	 change 	 d 	 	all	of	our	 live 	 s 	 	,	can	transform	a	country	--	and	a	continent	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 hard 	 ly 	 	made	it	to	analog	,	let	 al 	 one 	 	digital	--	 blow 	 s 	 	my	mind	.
but	it	did	n't	start	out	that	way	.
the	first	long	-	distance	line	from	boston	to	new	york	was	used	in	1885	on	the	phone	.
it	was	just	nine	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	that	addis	ababa	was	 connect 	 ed 	 	by	phone	to	harare	,	which	is	500	 kilometer 	 s 	 	away	.
since	then	,	not	that	much	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	.
the	average	 wait 	 ing 	 	time	to	get	a	 land 	 line 	 	in	ethiopia	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	about	seven	or	eight	 year 	 s 	 	.
but	 wire 	 less 	 	technology	was	n't	 dream 	 t 	 	up	then	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	i	'm	irish	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	i	know	how	 import 	 ant 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	is	.
communication	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	for	ethiopia	--	will	transform	the	country	.
 nurse 	 s 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	better	training	,	 pharmacist 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	order	 suppli 	 es 	 	,	 doctor 	 s 	 	sharing	 the 	 ir 	 	 expert 	 ise 	 	in	all	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	of	medicine	.
it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	good	idea	to	get	them	wired	.
and	that	is	my	third	and	final	wish	for	you	at	the	ted	 con 	 ference 	 	.
