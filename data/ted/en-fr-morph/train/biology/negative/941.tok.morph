so	i	work	in	 market 	 ing 	 	,	which	i	love	,	but	my	first	 pass 	 ion 	 	was	physics	,	a	 pass 	 ion 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	to	me	by	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	school	teacher	,	when	i	had	a	little	less	gray	hair	.
so	he	taught	me	that	physics	is	cool	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 teach 	 es 	 	us	so	much	about	the	world	around	us	.
and	i	'm	going	to	 s 	 pend 	 	the	next	few	 minute 	 s 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 con 	 vince 	 	you	that	physics	can	teach	us	 some 	 thing 	 	about	 market 	 ing 	 	.
so	quick	show	of	 hand 	 s 	 	--	who	 stud 	 ied 	 	some	 market 	 ing 	 	in	university	?
who	 stud 	 ied 	 	some	physics	in	university	?
 pre 	 tty 	 	good	.	and	at	school	?
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	 lot 	 s 	 	of	you	.
so	,	 hope 	 fully 	 	 th 	 is 	 	will	 br 	 ing 	 	back	some	happy	,	or	possibly	some	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 disturb 	 ing 	 	 memor 	 ies 	 	.
so	,	physics	and	 market 	 ing 	 	.
we	'll	start	with	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	--	newton	's	law	:	``	the	force	 equal 	 s 	 	mass	 time 	 s 	 	 accele 	 ration 	 	.	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	turkish	 air 	 lines 	 	should	have	 stud 	 ied 	 	a	bit	more	 care 	 fully 	 	before	they	ran	 th 	 is 	 	campaign	.
but	if	we	 re 	 arrange 	 	 th 	 is 	 	formula	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	we	can	get	to	 accele 	 ration 	 	 equal 	 s 	 	force	over	mass	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	that	for	a	 large 	 r 	 	particle	--	a	 large 	 r 	 	mass	--	it	 requir 	 es 	 	more	force	to	change	 it 	 s 	 	direction	.
it	's	the	same	with	 brand 	 s 	 	:
the	more	massive	a	brand	,	the	more	 bag 	 g 	 age 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	,	the	more	force	is	 need 	 ed 	 	to	change	 it 	 s 	 	 position 	 ing 	 	.
and	that	's	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	why	arthur	andersen	chose	to	launch	accenture	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	try	to	 persuad 	 e 	 	the	world	that	andersen	's	could	stand	for	 some 	 thing 	 	other	than	 account 	 ancy 	 	.
it	 explain 	 s 	 	why	 ho 	 over 	 	found	it	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	to	 persuad 	 e 	 	the	world	that	it	was	more	than	vacuum	 clean 	 ers 	 	,	and	why	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	like	unilever	and	p	&	g	keep	 brand 	 s 	 	 separat 	 e 	 	,	like	ariel	and	pringles	and	dove	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 hav 	 ing 	 	one	giant	parent	brand	.
so	the	physics	is	that	the	 big 	 ger 	 	the	mass	of	an	object	the	more	force	is	 need 	 ed 	 	to	change	 it 	 s 	 	direction	.
the	 market 	 ing 	 	is	,	the	 big 	 ger 	 	a	brand	,	the	more	difficult	it	is	to	 re 	 position 	 	it	.
so	think	about	a	portfolio	of	 brand 	 s 	 	or	 may 	 be 	 	new	 brand 	 s 	 	for	new	 venture 	 s 	 	.
now	,	who	 remember 	 s 	 	heisenberg	's	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	principle	?
 get 	 ting 	 	a	little	more	technical	now	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 say 	 s 	 	that	it	's	 im 	 possible 	 	,	by	definition	,	to	measure	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	state	--	i.e	.	,	the	position	--	and	the	 moment 	 um 	 	of	a	particle	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	act	of	 measur 	 ing 	 	it	,	by	definition	,	 change 	 s 	 	it	.
so	to	explain	that	--	if	you	've	got	an	 element 	 ary 	 	particle	and	you	shine	a	light	on	it	,	then	the	 photo 	 n 	 	of	light	 ha 	 s 	 	 moment 	 um 	 	,	which	 knock 	 s 	 	the	particle	,	so	you	do	n't	know	where	it	was	before	you	 look 	 ed 	 	at	it	.
by	 measur 	 ing 	 	it	,	the	act	of	 measure 	 ment 	 	 change 	 s 	 	it	.
the	act	of	 observ 	 ation 	 	 change 	 s 	 	it	.
it	's	the	same	in	 market 	 ing 	 	.
so	with	the	act	of	 observ 	 ing 	 	 consumer 	 s 	 	,	 change 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	behavior	.
think	about	the	group	of	 mom 	 s 	 	who	are	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	children	in	a	focus	group	,	and	 al 	 most 	 	 non 	 e 	 	of	them	buy	 lot 	 s 	 	of	junk	food	.
and	yet	,	mcdonald	's	 sell 	 s 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	 burger 	 s 	 	every	year	.
think	about	the	people	who	are	on	 accompani 	 ed 	 	 shop 	 s 	 	in	 super 	 market 	 s 	 	,	who	stuff	 the 	 ir 	 	 troll 	 ey 	 s 	 	full	of	fresh	green	 veget 	 able 	 s 	 	and	fruit	,	but	do	n't	shop	like	that	any	other	day	.
and	if	you	think	about	the	number	of	people	who	claim	in	 survey 	 s 	 	to	 regular 	 ly 	 	look	for	porn	on	the	web	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	few	.
yet	,	at	google	,	we	know	it	's	the	number	-	one	 search 	 ed 	 	for	 categor 	 y 	 	.
so	 luck 	 ily 	 	,	the	science	--	no	,	sorry	--	the	 market 	 ing 	 	is	 get 	 ting 	 	 eas 	 ier 	 	.
 luck 	 ily 	 	,	with	now	better	point	-	of	-	sale	 track 	 ing 	 	,	more	digital	media	consumption	,	you	can	measure	more	what	 consumer 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	what	they	say	they	do	.
so	the	physics	is	you	can	never	 accurate 	 ly 	 	and	 exact 	 ly 	 	measure	a	particle	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 observ 	 ation 	 	 change 	 s 	 	it	.
the	 market 	 ing 	 	is	--	the	 mess 	 age 	 	for	 market 	 ing 	 	is	--	that	try	to	measure	what	 consumer 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	what	they	say	they	'll	do	or	 anticip 	 ate 	 	they	'll	do	.
so	next	,	the	scientific	method	--	an	axiom	of	physics	,	of	all	science	--	 say 	 s 	 	you	can	not	prove	a	 hypo 	 thesis 	 	through	 observ 	 ation 	 	,
you	can	 on 	 ly 	 	 dis 	 prove 	 	it	.
what	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	is	you	can	gather	more	and	more	data	around	a	 hypo 	 thesis 	 	or	a	 position 	 ing 	 	,	and	it	will	 strength 	 en 	 	it	,	but	it	will	not	 conclusive 	 ly 	 	prove	it	.
and	 on 	 ly 	 	one	 contr 	 ary 	 	data	point	can	blow	your	 theor 	 y 	 	out	of	the	water	.
so	if	we	take	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	--	ptolemy	had	 dozen 	 s 	 	of	data	 point 	 s 	 	to	support	his	 theor 	 y 	 	that	the	 planet 	 s 	 	would	 rot 	 ate 	 	around	the	earth	.
it	 on 	 ly 	 	took	one	 ro 	 bust 	 	 observ 	 ation 	 	from	copernicus	to	blow	that	idea	out	of	the	water	.
and	there	are	 parallel 	 s 	 	for	 market 	 ing 	 	--
you	can	invest	for	a	long	time	in	a	brand	,	but	a	single	 contr 	 ary 	 	 observ 	 ation 	 	of	that	 position 	 ing 	 	will	destroy	 consumer 	 s 	 	'	belief	.
take	bp	--
they	 s 	 pent 	 	 million 	 s 	 	of	 pound 	 s 	 	over	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	building	up	 it 	 s 	 	credentials	 a 	 s 	 	an	 environment 	 ally 	 	friendly	brand	,	but	then	one	little	accident	.
think	about	toyota	.
it	was	,	for	a	long	time	,	 revere 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	most	 reli 	 able 	 	of	 car 	 s 	 	,	and	then	they	had	the	big	recall	incident	.
and	tiger	 wood 	 s 	 	,	for	a	long	time	,	the	perfect	brand	ambassador	.
well	,	you	know	the	story	.
so	the	physics	is	that	you	can	not	prove	a	 hypo 	 thesis 	 	,	but	it	's	easy	to	 dis 	 prove 	 	it	--
any	 hypo 	 thesis 	 	is	 sha 	 ky 	 	.
and	the	 market 	 ing 	 	is	that	not	matter	how	much	you	've	 invest 	 ed 	 	in	your	brand	,	one	bad	week	can	 under 	 mine 	 	 decade 	 s 	 	of	good	work	.
so	be	 re 	 ally 	 	 care 	 ful 	 	to	try	and	avoid	the	screw	-	 up 	 s 	 	that	can	 under 	 mine 	 	your	brand	.
and	 last 	 ly 	 	,	to	the	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 obscur 	 e 	 	world	of	 ent 	 ropy 	 	--	the	second	law	of	 thermo 	 dynamic 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 say 	 s 	 	that	 ent 	 ropy 	 	,	which	is	a	measure	of	the	 dis 	 order 	 	of	a	system	,	will	 al 	 ways 	 	 in 	 crease 	 	.
the	same	is	true	of	 market 	 ing 	 	.
if	we	go	back	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	one	 mess 	 age 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	controlled	by	one	 market 	 ing 	 	 manage 	 r 	 	could	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	define	a	brand	.
but	where	we	are	 to 	 day 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	have	 change 	 d 	 	.
you	can	get	a	strong	brand	image	or	a	 mess 	 age 	 	and	put	it	out	there	like	the	 conserv 	 ative 	 	party	did	 ear 	 lier 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	with	 the 	 ir 	 	election	 post 	 er 	 	.
but	then	you	lose	control	of	it	.
with	the	kind	of	digital	comment	creation	and	 distribut 	 ion 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	that	are	 avail 	 able 	 	now	to	every	consumer	,	it	's	 im 	 possible 	 	to	control	where	it	 go 	 es 	 	.
your	brand	 start 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 dispers 	 ed 	 	,
it	 get 	 s 	 	more	chaotic	.
it	's	out	of	your	control	.
i	 actual 	 ly 	 	saw	him	speak	--	he	did	a	good	job	.
but	while	 th 	 is 	 	may	be	 un 	 settl 	 ing 	 	for	 market 	 ers 	 	,	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	good	thing	.
 th 	 is 	 	 distribut 	 ion 	 	of	brand	energy	 get 	 s 	 	your	brand	 close 	 r 	 	to	the	people	,	more	in	with	the	people	.
it	 make 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 distribut 	 ion 	 	of	energy	a	 democrat 	 izing 	 	force	,	which	is	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	good	for	your	brand	.
so	,	the	 less 	 on 	 	from	physics	is	that	 ent 	 ropy 	 	will	 al 	 ways 	 	 in 	 crease 	 	;	it	's	a	fundamental	law	.
the	 mess 	 age 	 	for	 market 	 ing 	 	is	that	your	brand	is	more	 dispers 	 ed 	 	.
you	ca	n't	fight	it	,	so	embrace	it	and	find	a	way	to	work	with	it	.
so	to	close	,	my	teacher	,	mr.	vutter	,	told	me	that	physics	is	cool	,	and	 hope 	 fully 	 	,	i	've	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	you	that	physics	can	teach	all	of	us	,	even	in	the	world	of	 market 	 ing 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	special	.
thank	you	.
