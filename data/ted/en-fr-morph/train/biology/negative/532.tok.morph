we	look	around	the	media	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	see	on	the	news	from	 ir 	 aq 	 	,	afghanistan	,	sierra	leone	,	and	the	conflict	 seem 	 s 	 	 in 	 comprehens 	 ible 	 	to	us	.
and	that	's	 certain 	 ly 	 	how	it	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	me	when	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	project	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	a	physicist	,	i	thought	,	well	if	you	give	me	some	data	,	i	could	 may 	 be 	 	understand	 th 	 is 	 	.	you	know	,	give	us	a	go	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	a	naive	new	zealander	i	thought	,	well	i	'll	go	to	the	 pent 	 agon 	 	.
can	you	get	me	some	information	?
no	.	so	i	had	to	think	a	little	 hard 	 er 	 	.
and	i	was	 watch 	 ing 	 	the	news	one	night	in	oxford	.
and	i	 look 	 ed 	 	down	at	the	 chat 	 tering 	 	 head 	 s 	 	on	my	channel	of	choice	.
and	i	saw	that	there	was	information	there	.
there	was	data	 with 	 in 	 	the	 stream 	 s 	 	of	news	that	we	 consum 	 e 	 	.
all	 th 	 is 	 	noise	around	us	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	information	.
so	what	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	was	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	like	open	source	 intellig 	 ence 	 	here	.
if	we	can	get	 en 	 ough 	 	of	these	 stream 	 s 	 	of	information	together	,	we	can	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	start	to	understand	the	war	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	i	did	.	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	a	team	together	,	an	 inter 	 disciplinary 	 	team	of	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	of	 economist 	 s 	 	,	 mathematic 	 ians 	 	.
we	 br 	 ought 	 	these	 guy 	 s 	 	together	and	we	 start 	 ed 	 	to	try	and	solve	 th 	 is 	 	.
we	did	it	in	three	 step 	 s 	 	.
the	first	step	we	did	was	to	collect	.	we	did	130	different	 source 	 s 	 	of	information	--	from	ngo	 report 	 s 	 	to	 news 	 paper 	 s 	 	and	cable	news	.
we	 br 	 ought 	 	 th 	 is 	 	raw	data	in	and	we	 filter 	 ed 	 	it	.
we	 extra 	 cted 	 	the	key	bits	on	information	to	build	the	 data 	 base 	 	.
that	 data 	 base 	 	 contain 	 ed 	 	the	 tim 	 ing 	 	of	 attack 	 s 	 	,	the	location	,	the	 s 	 ize 	 	and	the	 weapon 	 s 	 	used	.
it	's	all	in	the	 stream 	 s 	 	of	information	we	 consum 	 e 	 	 dai 	 ly 	 	,	we	just	have	to	know	how	to	pull	it	out	.
and	once	we	had	 th 	 is 	 	we	could	start	 do 	 ing 	 	some	cool	stuff	.
what	if	we	 we 	 re 	 	to	look	at	the	 distribut 	 ion 	 	of	the	 s 	 ize 	 s 	 	of	 attack 	 s 	 	?
what	would	that	tell	us	?
so	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.	and	you	can	see	here	on	the	 horizon 	 tal 	 	axis	you	've	got	the	number	of	people	 kill 	 ed 	 	in	an	attack	or	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	attack	.
and	on	the	 vert 	 ical 	 	axis	you	've	got	the	number	of	 attack 	 s 	 	.
so	we	plot	data	for	 s 	 ample 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
you	see	some	sort	of	random	 distribut 	 ion 	 	--	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	67	 attack 	 s 	 	,	one	person	was	 kill 	 ed 	 	,	or	47	 attack 	 s 	 	where	seven	people	 we 	 re 	 	 kill 	 ed 	 	.
we	did	 th 	 is 	 	exact	same	thing	for	 ir 	 aq 	 	.
and	we	did	n't	know	,	for	 ir 	 aq 	 	what	we	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	find	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	what	we	found	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	surprising	.
you	take	all	of	the	conflict	,	all	of	the	 cha 	 os 	 	,	all	of	the	noise	,	and	out	of	that	 come 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	precise	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 distribut 	 ion 	 	of	the	way	 attack 	 s 	 	are	 order 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	conflict	.
 th 	 is 	 	 ble 	 w 	 	our	mind	.
why	should	a	conflict	like	 ir 	 aq 	 	have	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	fundamental	signature	?
why	should	there	be	order	in	war	?
we	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	understand	that	.
we	thought	 may 	 be 	 	there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	special	about	 ir 	 aq 	 	.
so	we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	a	few	more	 conflict 	 s 	 	.
we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	colombia	,	we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	afghanistan	,	and	we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	senegal	.
and	the	same	pattern	 emerge 	 d 	 	in	each	conflict	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	n't	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	happen	.
these	are	different	 war 	 s 	 	,	with	different	religious	 fact 	 ions 	 	,	different	 politic 	 al 	 	 fact 	 ions 	 	,	and	different	 socio 	 economic 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	.
and	yet	the	fundamental	 pattern 	 s 	 	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	them	are	the	same	.
so	we	went	a	little	 wide 	 r 	 	.
we	 look 	 ed 	 	around	the	world	at	all	the	data	we	could	get	our	 hand 	 s 	 	on	.
from	peru	to	indonesia	,	we	 stud 	 ied 	 	 th 	 is 	 	same	pattern	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	we	found	that	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 we 	 re 	 	the	 distribut 	 ions 	 	these	straight	lines	,	but	the	 slop 	 e 	 	of	these	lines	,	they	 cluster 	 ed 	 	around	 th 	 is 	 	value	of	alpha	 equal 	 s 	 	2.5	.
and	we	could	generate	an	 equ 	 ation 	 	that	could	predict	the	 like 	 li 	 hood 	 	of	an	attack	.
what	we	're	 say 	 ing 	 	here	is	the	 prob 	 ability 	 	of	an	attack	 kill 	 ing 	 	x	number	of	people	in	a	country	like	 ir 	 aq 	 	is	equal	to	a	constant	,	 time 	 s 	 	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	that	attack	,	raised	to	the	power	of	negative	alpha	.
and	negative	alpha	is	the	 slop 	 e 	 	of	that	line	i	 show 	 ed 	 	you	before	.
so	what	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	data	,	 statistic 	 s 	 	.	what	 do 	 es 	 	it	tell	us	about	these	 conflict 	 s 	 	?
that	was	a	 challeng 	 e 	 	we	had	to	face	 a 	 s 	 	 physicist 	 s 	 	.
how	do	we	explain	 th 	 is 	 	?
and	what	we	 re 	 ally 	 	found	was	that	alpha	,	if	we	think	about	it	,	is	the	 organ 	 ization 	 al 	 	structure	of	the	insurgency	.
alpha	is	the	 distribut 	 ion 	 	of	the	 s 	 ize 	 s 	 	of	 attack 	 s 	 	,	which	is	 re 	 ally 	 	the	 distribut 	 ion 	 	of	the	group	strength	 carry 	 ing 	 	out	the	 attack 	 s 	 	.
so	we	look	at	a	process	of	group	 dynamic 	 s 	 	:	 coalesce 	 nce 	 	and	 fragment 	 ation 	 	,
 group 	 s 	 	coming	together	,	 group 	 s 	 	 break 	 ing 	 	 a 	 part 	 	.
and	we	start	running	the	 number 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	.	can	we	 simul 	 ate 	 	it	?
can	we	create	the	kind	of	 pattern 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	in	 place 	 s 	 	like	 ir 	 aq 	 	?
 turn 	 s 	 	out	we	kind	of	do	a	 reason 	 able 	 	job	.
we	can	run	these	 simul 	 ations 	 	.
we	can	 re 	 create 	 	 th 	 is 	 	using	a	process	of	group	 dynamic 	 s 	 	to	explain	the	 pattern 	 s 	 	that	we	see	all	around	the	 conflict 	 s 	 	around	the	world	.
so	what	's	going	on	?
why	should	these	different	--	 seem 	 ing 	 ly 	 	different	 conflict 	 s 	 	have	the	same	 pattern 	 s 	 	?
now	what	i	 believ 	 e 	 	is	going	on	is	that	the	insurgent	 force 	 s 	 	,	they	evolve	over	time	.	they	adapt	.
and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	there	is	 on 	 ly 	 	one	solution	to	fight	a	much	 strong 	 er 	 	 ene 	 my 	 	.
and	if	you	do	n't	find	that	solution	 a 	 s 	 	an	insurgent	force	,	you	do	n't	exist	.
so	every	insurgent	force	that	is	 on 	 going 	 	,	every	conflict	that	is	 on 	 going 	 	,	it	's	going	to	look	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	that	is	what	we	think	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
taking	it	forward	,	how	do	we	change	it	?
how	do	we	end	a	war	like	 ir 	 aq 	 	?
what	 do 	 es 	 	it	look	like	?
alpha	is	the	structure	.	it	's	got	a	 s 	 table 	 	state	at	2.5	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 war 	 s 	 	look	like	when	they	 continu 	 e 	 	.
we	've	got	to	change	that	.
we	can	push	it	up	:
the	 force 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	more	 fragment 	 ed 	 	;
there	is	more	of	them	,	but	they	are	 weak 	 er 	 	.
or	we	push	it	down	:
they	're	more	 ro 	 bust 	 	;	there	is	less	 group 	 s 	 	;
but	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	you	can	 s 	 it 	 	and	talk	to	them	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	graph	here	,	i	'm	going	to	show	you	now	.
no	one	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	before	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 liter 	 ally 	 	stuff	that	we	've	come	through	last	week	.
and	we	see	the	evolution	of	alpha	through	time	.
we	see	it	start	.	and	we	see	it	grow	up	to	the	 s 	 table 	 	state	the	 war 	 s 	 	around	the	world	look	like	.
and	it	 stay 	 s 	 	there	through	the	invasion	of	fallujah	 un 	 til 	 	the	samarra	 bomb 	 ing 	 s 	 	in	the	iraqi	 election 	 s 	 	of	'06	.
and	the	system	 get 	 s 	 	 per 	 tur 	 bed 	 	.	it	 move 	 s 	 	 up 	 ward 	 s 	 	to	a	 fragment 	 ed 	 	state	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	when	the	 s 	 urge 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	.
and	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	who	you	ask	,	the	 s 	 urge 	 	was	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	push	it	up	even	further	.
the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
the	 group 	 s 	 	 be 	 came 	 	 strong 	 er 	 	.
they	 be 	 came 	 	more	 ro 	 bust 	 	.
and	so	i	'm	 think 	 ing 	 	,	right	,	great	,	it	's	going	to	keep	going	down	.
we	can	talk	to	them	.	we	can	get	a	solution	.	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
it	's	 move 	 d 	 	up	 aga 	 in 	 	.	the	 group 	 s 	 	are	more	 fragment 	 ed 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	me	one	of	two	 thing 	 s 	 	.
either	we	're	back	where	we	 start 	 ed 	 	and	the	 s 	 urge 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	had	no	effect	;
or	 final 	 ly 	 	the	 group 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 fragment 	 ed 	 	to	the	 ex 	 tent 	 	that	we	can	start	to	think	about	 may 	 be 	 	moving	out	.
i	do	n't	know	what	the	answer	is	to	that	.
but	i	know	that	we	should	be	looking	at	the	structure	of	the	insurgency	to	answer	that	question	.
thank	you	.
