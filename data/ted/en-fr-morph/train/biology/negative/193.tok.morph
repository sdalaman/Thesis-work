what	is	 bio 	 energy 	 	?	 bio 	 energy 	 	is	not	ethanol	.
 bio 	 energy 	 	is	n't	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	.	 bio 	 energy 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	which	 seem 	 s 	 	 counter 	 intuitive 	 	.	 bio 	 energy 	 	is	oil	.	it	's	gas	.	it	's	coal	.	and	part	of	building	that	bridge	to	the	future	,	to	the	point	where	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	in	a	rational	way	,	or	put	up	these	geo	-	spatial	 orbit 	 s 	 	that	will	twirl	or	do	 micro 	 wave 	 s 	 	or	stuff	,	is	going	to	depend	on	how	we	understand	 bio 	 energy 	 	and	manage	it	.	and	to	do	that	,	you	 re 	 ally 	 	have	to	look	first	at	 agricultur 	 e 	 	.
so	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 plant 	 ing 	 	stuff	for	11,000	 year 	 s 	 	.	and	in	the	measure	that	we	plant	stuff	,	what	we	learn	from	 agricultur 	 e 	 	is	you	've	got	to	deal	with	 pest 	 s 	 	,	you	've	got	to	deal	with	all	 type 	 s 	 	of	awful	 thing 	 s 	 	,	you	've	got	to	 cultiv 	 ate 	 	stuff	.	in	the	measure	that	you	learn	how	to	use	water	to	 cultiv 	 ate 	 	,	then	you	're	going	to	be	able	to	spread	beyond	the	nile	.
you	're	going	to	be	able	to	power	stuff	,	so	 irrig 	 ation 	 	 make 	 s 	 	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
 irrig 	 ation 	 	 start 	 s 	 	to	make	you	be	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	plant	stuff	where	you	want	it	,	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	where	the	 river 	 s 	 	flood	.	you	start	 get 	 ting 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 organ 	 ic 	 	 agricultur 	 e 	 	;	you	start	 put 	 ting 	 	 machine 	 ry 	 	onto	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	.	 machine 	 ry 	 	,	with	a	whole	bunch	of	water	,	 lead 	 s 	 	to	 ver 	 y 	 	large	-	scale	 agricultur 	 e 	 	.
you	put	together	 machine 	 s 	 	and	water	,	and	you	get	 land 	 scapes 	 	that	look	like	 th 	 is 	 	.	and	then	you	get	 sale 	 s 	 	that	look	like	 th 	 is 	 	.	it	's	brute	force	.	so	what	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	in	 agricultur 	 e 	 	is	you	start	out	with	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	a	 reason 	 ably 	 	natural	system	.	you	start	 ta 	 ming 	 	that	natural	system	.	you	put	a	lot	of	force	 be 	 hind 	 	that	natural	system	.	you	put	a	whole	bunch	of	 pest 	 icide 	 s 	 	and	 herb 	 icide 	 s 	 	--	--	 be 	 hind 	 	that	natural	system	,	and	you	end	up	with	 system 	 s 	 	that	look	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	it	's	all	brute	force	.	and	that	's	the	way	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 approach 	 ing 	 	energy	.	so	the	 less 	 on 	 	in	 agricultur 	 e 	 	is	that	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	change	the	system	that	's	based	on	brute	force	 a 	 s 	 	you	start	 mer 	 ging 	 	that	system	and	 learn 	 ing 	 	that	system	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	 app 	 ly 	 ing 	 	biology	.	and	you	move	from	a	discipline	of	 engineer 	 ing 	 	,	you	move	from	a	discipline	of	 chemist 	 ry 	 	,	 in 	 to 	 	a	discipline	of	biology	.	and	 prob 	 ably 	 	one	of	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	on	the	planet	is	 th 	 is 	 	guy	 be 	 hind 	 	me	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	guy	 call 	 ed 	 	norman	borlaug	.	he	won	the	 no 	 bel 	 	prize	.	he	's	got	the	 congress 	 ional 	 	 med 	 al 	 	of	honor	.	he	 deserve 	 s 	 	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	.	and	he	 deserve 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 prob 	 ably 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	fed	more	people	than	any	other	human	 be 	 ing 	 	 al 	 ive 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 research 	 ed 	 	how	to	put	biology	 be 	 hind 	 	 seed 	 s 	 	.	he	did	 th 	 is 	 	in	mexico	.	the	reason	why	india	and	 chin 	 a 	 	no	 long 	 er 	 	have	these	massive	 famine 	 s 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	norman	borlaug	taught	them	how	to	grow	 grain 	 s 	 	in	a	more	efficient	way	and	 launch 	 ed 	 	the	green	revolution	.	that	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	a	lot	of	people	have	 critic 	 ized 	 	.	but	of	course	,	 t 	 hose 	 	are	people	who	do	n't	 real 	 ize 	 	that	 chin 	 a 	 	and	india	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	huge	 amount 	 s 	 	of	 starv 	 ing 	 	people	,	are	 export 	 ing 	 	 grain 	 s 	 	.
and	the	 iron 	 y 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	system	is	the	place	where	he	did	the	research	,	which	was	mexico	,	did	n't	adopt	 th 	 is 	 	technology	,	 ignor 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	technology	,	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	why	 th 	 is 	 	technology	should	be	thought	about	,	but	not	 re 	 ally 	 	 appli 	 ed 	 	.
and	mexico	 remain 	 s 	 	one	of	the	largest	grain	 import 	 ers 	 	on	the	planet	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 app 	 ly 	 	technology	that	was	 discover 	 ed 	 	in	mexico	.	and	in	fact	,	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 recogn 	 ized 	 	 th 	 is 	 	man	,	to	the	point	where	there	are	n't	 statue 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	man	all	over	mexico	.	there	are	in	 chin 	 a 	 	and	india	.	and	the
institute	that	 th 	 is 	 	guy	ran	 ha 	 s 	 	now	 move 	 d 	 	to	india	.	that	is	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	 adopt 	 ing 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	and	 discuss 	 ing 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	.
now	,	it	's	not	just	that	 th 	 is 	 	guy	fed	a	huge	amount	of	people	in	the	world	.	it	's	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	net	effect	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	what	technology	 do 	 es 	 	,	if	you	understand	biology	.
what	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	 agricultur 	 e 	 	?	well	,	if	you	take	 agricultur 	 e 	 	over	a	century	,	 agricultur 	 e 	 	in	about	1900	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	 recogn 	 izable 	 	to	 some 	 body 	 	 plant 	 ing 	 	a	thousand	 year 	 s 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	.	 yea 	 h 	 	,	the	 plow 	 s 	 	look	different	.	the	 machine 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 tract 	 ors 	 	or	stuff	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 mule 	 s 	 	,	but	the	 farm 	 er 	 	would	have	 under 	 stood 	 	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	the	guy	's	 do 	 ing 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	why	he	's	 do 	 ing 	 	it	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	he	's	going	.	what	 re 	 ally 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	to	change	in	 agricultur 	 e 	 	is	when	you	 start 	 ed 	 	moving	from	 th 	 is 	 	brute	force	 engineer 	 ing 	 	and	 chemist 	 ry 	 	 in 	 to 	 	biology	,	and	that	's	where	you	get	your	 product 	 ivity 	 	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	.	and	 a 	 s 	 	you	do	that	stuff	,	here	's	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	 product 	 ivity 	 	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	,	you	go	from	250	 hour 	 s 	 	to	produce	100	 bush 	 el 	 s 	 	,	to	40	,	to	15	,	to	five	.	 agricultur 	 al 	 	labor	 product 	 ivity 	 	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	seven	 time 	 s 	 	,	1950	to	2000	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	the	rest	of	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	about	2.5	 time 	 s 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 absolute 	 ly 	 	massive	 in 	 crease 	 	in	how	much	is	 produce 	 d 	 	per	person	.
the	effect	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	of	course	,	is	it	's	not	just	 am 	 ber 	 	 wave 	 s 	 	of	grain	,	it	is	 mountain 	 s 	 	of	stuff	.
and	50	percent	of	the	eu	budget	is	going	to	subsidize	 agricultur 	 e 	 	from	 mountain 	 s 	 	of	stuff	that	people	have	 over 	 produce 	 d 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	would	be	a	good	 out 	 come 	 	for	energy	.	and	of
course	,	by	now	,	you	're	 prob 	 ably 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	to	 your 	 self 	 	,	``	self	,	i	thought	i	came	to	a	talk	about	energy	and	here	's	 th 	 is 	 	guy	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	biology	.	``
so	where	's	the	link	between	these	two	 thing 	 s 	 	?
one	of	the	 iron 	 ies 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	whole	system	is	we	're	 discuss 	 ing 	 	what	to	do	about	a	system	that	we	do	n't	understand	.	we	do	n't	even	know	what	oil	is	.	we
do	n't	know	where	oil	 come 	 s 	 	from	.	i	mean	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	it	's	still	a	source	of	debate	what	 th 	 is 	 	black	river	of	stuff	is	and	where	it	 come 	 s 	 
from	.	the	best	assumption	,	and	one	of	the	best	 guess 	 es 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	,	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	 come 	 s 	 	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	,	that	these	 thing 	 s 	 	absorb	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	,	rot	under	pressure	for	 million 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	you	get	these	black	 river 	 s 	 	.
now	,	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	about	that	thesis	--	if	that	thesis	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	be	true	--	is	that	oil	,	and	all	 hydro 	 carbon 	 s 	 	,	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	 concent 	 rated 	 	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	.	and	if	you	think	of	 bio 	 energy 	 	,	 bio 	 energy 	 	is	n't	ethanol	.	 bio 	 energy 	 	is	taking	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	 concent 	 rating 	 	it	in	 amoeb 	 a 	 s 	 	,	 concent 	 rating 	 	it	in	 plant 	 s 	 	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	that	's	why	you	get	these	 rain 	 bow 	 s 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	're	looking	at	 th 	 is 	 	system	,	if	 hydro 	 carbon 	 s 	 	are	 concent 	 rated 	 	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	,	then	 bio 	 energy 	 	 work 	 s 	 	in	a	different	way	.	and	we	've	got	to	start	 think 	 ing 	 	of	oil	and	other	 hydro 	 carbon 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	these	solar	 pan 	 el 	 s 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	that	's	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	why	if	you	fly	over	west	texas	,	the	 type 	 s 	 	of	 well 	 s 	 	that	you	're	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	see	do	n't	look	 un 	 like 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	of	kansas	and	 t 	 hose 	 	 irrig 	 ated 	 	 plot 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	how	you	farm	oil	.	and	 a 	 s 	 	you	think	of	 farm 	 ing 	 	oil	and	how	oil	 ha 	 s 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	,	we	 start 	 ed 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	brute	force	approach	.	and	then	what	did	we	learn	?	then	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	we	had	to	go	 big 	 ger 	 	.	and	then	what	'd	we	learn	?	then	we	have	to	go	even	 big 	 ger 	 	.	and	we	are	 get 	 ting 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 destruct 	 ive 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	're	going	out	and	 farm 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 bio 	 energy 	 	.
these	are	the	athabasca	tar	 sand 	 s 	 	,	and	there	's	an	enormous	amount	--	first	of	 min 	 ing 	 	,	the	largest	 truck 	 s 	 	in	the	world	are	 work 	 ing 	 	here	,	and	then	you	've	got	to	pull	out	 th 	 is 	 	black	sludge	,	which	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	oil	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	flow	.	it	's	 ti 	 ed 	 	to	the	sand	.	and	then	you	've	got	to	use	a	lot	of	 s 	 team 	 	to	 separat 	 e 	 	it	,	which	 on 	 ly 	 	 work 	 s 	 	at	 to 	 day 	 	's	oil	 price 	 s 	 	.
coal	.	coal	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	be	 virtual 	 ly 	 	the	same	stuff	.	it	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	 plant 	 s 	 	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	that	these	have	 be 	 en 	 	 burn 	 ed 	 	and	 crush 	 ed 	 	under	pressure	.
so	you	take	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	burn	it	,	you	put	it	under	pressure	,	and	 like 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	not	,	you	get	 th 	 is 	 	.	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	i	stress	:	we	do	n't	know	.
which	is	 cur 	 ious 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	debate	all	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	.	but	 a 	 s 	 	you	think	of	coal	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 burn 	 ed 	 	wheat	 ker 	 nel 	 s 	 	look	like	.	not	 entire 	 ly 	 	 un 	 like 	 	coal	.
and	of	course	,	 coal 	 mine 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	 place 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	in	some	of	these	 coal 	 mine 	 s 	 	,	you	get	gas	.	when	that	gas	 blow 	 s 	 	up	,	people	die	.	so	you	're	producing	a	 bio 	 gas 	 	out	of	coal	in	some	 mine 	 s 	 	,	but	not	in	 other 	 s 	 	.
any	place	you	see	a	 different 	 ial 	 	,	there	're	some	 interest 	 ing 	 	 question 	 s 	 	.	there	's	some	 question 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	to	what	you	should	be	 do 	 ing 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	.	but	 aga 	 in 	 	,	coal	.	 may 	 be 	 	the	same	stuff	,	 may 	 be 	 	the	same	system	,	 may 	 be 	 	 bio 	 energy 	 	,	and	you	're	 app 	 ly 	 ing 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	technology	.
here	's	your	brute	force	approach	.	once	you	get	through	your	brute	force	approach	,	then	you	just	rip	off	whole	 mountain 	 top 	 s 	 	.	and	you	end	up	with	the	single	largest	source	of	carbon	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	,	which	are	coal	-	 fire 	 d 	 	gas	 plant 	 s 	 	.	that	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	not	the	best	use	of	 bio 	 energy 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	think	of	what	are	the	 alter 	 native 	 s 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	system	--	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	find	 alter 	 native 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	the	u.s.	is	 dwindl 	 ing 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	petroleum	 re 	 serve 	 s 	 	,	but	it	is	not	 dwindl 	 ing 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	coal	 re 	 serve 	 s 	 	,	nor	is	 chin 	 a 	 	.	there	are	huge	coal	 re 	 serve 	 s 	 	that	are	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	out	there	,	and	we	've	got	to	start	 think 	 ing 	 	of	them	 a 	 s 	 	 bio 	 logical 	 	energy	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	we	keep	 treat 	 ing 	 	them	 a 	 s 	 	chemical	energy	,	or	 engineer 	 ing 	 	energy	,	we	're	going	to	be	in	deep	doo	-	doo	.
gas	is	a	similar	issue	.	gas	is	 al 	 so 	 	a	 bio 	 logical 	 	product	.	and	 a 	 s 	 	you	think	of	gas	,	well	,	you	're	familiar	with	gas	.	and	here	's	a	different	way	of	 min 	 ing 	 	coal	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	coal	bed	 m 	 ethane 	 	.	why	is	 th 	 is 	 	picture	 interest 	 ing 	 	?	 be 	 cause 	 	if	coal	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	be	 concent 	 rated 	 	plant	life	,	the	reason	why	you	may	get	a	 different 	 ial 	 	in	gas	 out 	 put 	 	between	one	mine	and	 an 	 other 	 	--	the	reason	why	one	mine	may	blow	up	and	 an 	 other 	 	one	may	not	blow	up	--	may	be	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	stuff	eating	that	stuff	and	producing	gas	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	well	-	known	 phenomen 	 on 	 	.	you	eat	certain	 thing 	 s 	 	,	you	produce	a	lot	of	gas	.	it	may	turn	out	that	 bio 	 logical 	 	 process 	 es 	 	in	 coal 	 mine 	 s 	 	have	the	same	process	.	if	that	is	true	,	then	one	of	the	ways	of	 get 	 ting 	 	the	energy	out	of	coal	may	not	be	to	rip	whole	 mountain 	 top 	 s 	 	off	,	and	it	may	not	be	to	burn	coal	.	it	may	be	to	have	stuff	process	that	coal	in	a	 bio 	 logical 	 	fashion	 a 	 s 	 	you	did	in	 agricultur 	 e 	 	.
that	is	what	 bio 	 energy 	 	is	.	it	is	not	ethanol	.	it	is	not	 sub 	 sid 	 ies 	 	to	a	few	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.	it	is	not	 import 	 ing 	 	corn	 in 	 to 	 	iowa	 be 	 cause 	 	you	've	built	so	 man 	 y 	 	of	these	ethanol	 plant 	 s 	 	.	it	is	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	understand	the	 transit 	 ion 	 	that	 occur 	 red 	 	in	 agricultur 	 e 	 	,	from	brute	force	 in 	 to 	 	 bio 	 logical 	 	force	.	and	in	the	measure	that	you	can	do	that	,	you	can	clean	some	stuff	,	and	you	can	clean	it	 pre 	 tty 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
we	 al 	 ready 	 	have	some	 indic 	 ators 	 	of	 product 	 ivity 	 	on
 th 	 is 	 	stuff	.	ok	,	if	you	put	 s 	 team 	 	 in 	 to 	 	coal	 field 	 s 	 	or	petroleum	 field 	 s 	 	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	running	for	 decade 	 s 	 	,	you	can	get	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 sub 	 stantial 	 	 in 	 crease 	 	,	like	an	eight	-	fold	 in 	 crease 	 	,	in	your	 out 	 put 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	 stage 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	think	of	 bio 	 material 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	guy	--	who	did	part	of	the	 s 	 equ 	 encing 	 	of	the	human	genome	,	who	just	 double 	 d 	 	the	 data 	 base 	 s 	 	of	 gene 	 s 	 	and	 protein 	 s 	 	known	on	earth	by	 s 	 ailing 	 	around	the	world	--	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	how	you	structure	 th 	 is 	 	.	and	there	's	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	smart	people	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.	and	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	 put 	 ting 	 	together	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	like	synthetic	 genomic 	 s 	 	,	like	,	a	cambria	,	like	codon	,	and	what	 t 	 hose 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	is	to	think	of	,	how	do	you	 app 	 ly 	 	 bio 	 logical 	 	 principle 	 s 	 	to	avoid	brute	force	?
think	of	it	in	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	 term 	 s 	 	.	think	of	it	 a 	 s 	 	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	program	stuff	for	specific	 purpose 	 s 	 	.	think	of	the	cell	 a 	 s 	 	a	 hard 	 ware 	 	.	think	of	the	 gene 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 soft 	 ware 	 	.	and	in	the	measure	that	you	begin	to	think	of	life	 a 	 s 	 	code	that	is	 inter 	 change 	 able 	 	,	that	can	 be 	 come 	 	energy	,	that	can	 be 	 come 	 	food	,	that	can	 be 	 come 	 	fiber	,	that	can	 be 	 come 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	that	can	 be 	 come 	 	a	whole	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	,	then	you	've	got	to	shift	your	approach	 a 	 s 	 	to	how	you	're	going	to	structure	and	deal	and	think	about	energy	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	way	.
what	are	the	first	 principle 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	and	where	are	we	 head 	 ing 	 	?	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	gentle	 giant 	 s 	 	on	the	planet	.	he	's	one	of	the	 nic 	 est 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	you	've	ever	met	.	his	name	is	hamilton	smith	.	he	won	the	 no 	 bel 	 	for	 figur 	 ing 	 	out	how	to	cut	 gene 	 s 	 	--	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 restrict 	 ion 	 	 enzyme 	 s 	 	.
he	was	at	hopkins	when	he	did	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	he	's	 s 	 uch 	 	a	modest	guy	that	the	day	he	won	,	his	mother	 call 	 ed 	 	him	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	did	n't	 real 	 ize 	 	there	was	 an 	 other 	 	ham	smith	at	hopkins	.	do	you	know	he	just	won	the	 no 	 bel 	 	?	``	i	mean	,	that	was	mom	,
but	 any 	 way 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	guy	is	just	a	class	act	.	you	find	him	at	the	bench	every	single	day	,	 work 	 ing 	 	on	a	pipette	and	building	stuff	.	and	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	guy	just	built	are	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
what	is	 th 	 is 	 	?	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	transplant	of	naked	dna	,	where	you	take	an	entire	dna	 oper 	 ating 	 	system	out	of	one	cell	,	insert	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	different	cell	,	and	have	that	cell	boot	up	 a 	 s 	 	a	 separat 	 e 	 	species	.	that	's	one	month	old	.	you	will	see	stuff	in	the	next	month	that	will	be	just	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	and	what	the	 implic 	 ations 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	are	,	we	're	going	to	start	not	just	 convert 	 ing 	 	ethanol	from	corn	with	 ver 	 y 	 	high	 sub 	 sid 	 ies 	 	.	we	're	going	to	start	 think 	 ing 	 	about	biology	 enter 	 ing 	 	energy	.	it	is	 ver 	 y 	 	expensive	to	process	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	,	both	in	economic	 term 	 s 	 	and	in	energy	 term 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 accumul 	 ates 	 	in	the	tar	 sand 	 s 	 	of	alberta	.	these	are	sulfur	 block 	 s 	 	.	 be 	 cause 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	 separat 	 e 	 	that	petroleum	from	the	sand	,	and	use	an	enormous	amount	of	energy	 in 	 side 	 	that	vapor	--	 s 	 team 	 	to	 separat 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	--	you	 al 	 so 	 	have	to	 separat 	 e 	 	out	the	sulfur	.	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	light	 crud 	 e 	 	and	heavy	 crud 	 e 	 	--	well	,	it	's	about	14	 buck 	 s 	 	a	barrel	.	that	's	why	you	're	building	these	 pyramid 	 s 	 	of	sulfur	 block 	 s 	 	.	and	by	the	way	,	the	scale	on	these	 thing 	 s 	 	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	large	.
now	,	if	you	can	take	part	of	the	energy	content	out	of	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	system	,	and	you	 re 	 ally 	 	do	start	 app 	 ly 	 ing 	 	 bio 	 logical 	 	 principle 	 s 	 	to	energy	.	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	a	bridge	to	the	point	where	you	can	get	to	wind	,	to	the	point	where	you	can	get	to	solar	,	to	the	point	where	you	can	get	to	nuclear	--	and	 hope 	 fully 	 	you	wo	n't	build	the	next	nuclear	plant	on	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 sea 	 shore 	 	next	to	an	 earth 	 quake 	 	fault	.	just	a	thought	.
but	in	the	 mean 	 time 	 	,	for	the	next	decade	at	 l 	 east 	 	,	the	name	of	the	game	is	 hydro 	 carbon 	 s 	 	.	and	be	that	oil	,	be	that	gas	,	be	that	coal	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	're	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	.	and	before	i	make	 th 	 is 	 	talk	too	long	,	here	's	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	the	current	energy	system	.
86	percent	of	the	energy	we	 consum 	 e 	 	are	 hydro 	 carbon 	 s 	 	.	that	 mean 	 s 	 	86	percent	of	the	stuff	we	're	 consum 	 ing 	 	are	 prob 	 ably 	 	 process 	 ed 	 	 plant 	 s 	 	and	 amoeb 	 a 	 s 	 	and	the	rest	of	the	stuff	.	and	there	's	a	role	in	here	for	 conserv 	 ation 	 	.	there	's	a	role	in	here	for	 alter 	 native 	 	stuff	,	but	we	've	 al 	 so 	 	got	to	get	that	other	 port 	 ion 	 	right	.
how	we	deal	with	that	other	 port 	 ion 	 	is	our	bridge	to	the	future	.	and	 a 	 s 	 	we	think	of	 th 	 is 	 	bridge	to	the	future	,	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	you	should	ponder	is	:	we	are	 leav 	 ing 	 	about	two	-	 third 	 s 	 	of	the	oil	 to 	 day 	 	 in 	 side 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 well 	 s 	 	.	so	we	're	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	an	enormous	amount	of	money	and	 leav 	 ing 	 	most	of	the	energy	down	there	.	which	,	of	course	,	 requir 	 es 	 	more	energy	to	go	out	and	get	energy	.	the	 ratio 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	idiotic	by	the	time	you	get	to	ethanol	.	it	may	even	be	a	one	-	to	-	one	ratio	on	the	energy	 in 	 put 	 	and	the	energy	 out 	 put 	 	.	that	is	a	stupid	way	of	 man 	 aging 	 	 th 	 is 	 	system	.
last	point	,	last	graph	.	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	've	got	to	do	is	to	 stabil 	 ize 	 	oil	 price 	 s 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	oil	 price 	 s 	 	look	like	,	ok	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	bad	system	 be 	 cause 	 	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	your	hurdle	rate	 get 	 s 	 	set	 ver 	 y 	 	low	.	people	come	up	with	 re 	 ally 	 	smart	 idea 	 s 	 	for	solar	 pan 	 el 	 s 	 	,	or	for	wind	,	or	for	 some 	 thing 	 	else	,	and	then	guess	what	?
the	oil	price	 go 	 es 	 	through	the	floor	.	that	company	 go 	 es 	 	out	of	business	,	and	then	you	can	 br 	 ing 	 	the	oil	price	back	up	.
so	if	i	had	one	 clo 	 s 	 ing 	 	and	modest	 suggest 	 ion 	 	,	let	's	set	a	 s 	 table 	 	oil	price	in	europe	and	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.	how	do	you	do	that	?	well	,	let	's	put	a	tax	on	oil	that	is	a	non	-	revenue	tax	,	and	it	 bas 	 ically 	 	 say 	 s 	 	for	the	next	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	price	of	oil	will	be	--	 what 	 ever 	 	you	want	,	35	 buck 	 s 	 	,	40	 buck 	 s 	 	.	if	the	opec	price	 fall 	 s 	 	 be 	 low 	 	that	,	we	tax	it	.	if	the	opec	price	 go 	 es 	 	above	that	,	the	tax	 go 	 es 	 	away	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	that	do	for	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	?	what	 do 	 es 	 	it	do	for	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	?	it	 tell 	 s 	 	people	,	if	you	can	produce	energy	for	less	than	35	 buck 	 s 	 	a	barrel	,	or	less	than	40	 buck 	 s 	 	a	barrel	,	or	less	than	50	 buck 	 s 	 	a	barrel	--	let	's	debate	it	--	you	will	have	a	business	.	but	let	's	not	put	people	through	 th 	 is 	 	cycle	where	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	pay	to	research	 be 	 cause 	 	your	company	will	go	out	of	business	 a 	 s 	 	opec	 drive 	 s 	 	 alter 	 native 	 s 	 	and	 keep 	 s 	 	 bio 	 energy 	 	from	 happen 	 ing 	 	.	thank	you	.
