in	africa	we	say	,	``	god	 g 	 ave 	 	the	white	man	a	watch	and	 g 	 ave 	 	the	black	man	time	.	``	i	think	,	how	is	it	possible	for	a	man	with	so	much	time	to	tell	his	story	in	18	 minute 	 s 	 	?
i	think	it	will	be	 quit 	 e 	 	a	 challeng 	 e 	 	for	me	.
most	african	 st 	 ories 	 	these	 day 	 s 	 	,	they	talk	about	famine	,	hiv	and	 aid 	 s 	 	,	poverty	or	war	.
but	my	story	that	i	would	like	to	share	with	you	 to 	 day 	 	is	the	one	about	success	.
it	is	about	a	country	in	the	 south 	 west 	 	of	africa	 call 	 ed 	 	namibia	.
namibia	 ha 	 s 	 	got	2.1	million	people	,	but	it	is	 on 	 ly 	 	twice	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	california	.
i	come	from	a	region	in	the	remote	 north 	 west 	 	part	of	the	country	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	kunene	region	.
and	in	the	center	of	kunene	region	is	the	village	of	sesfontein	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	i	was	born	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	where	i	'm	coming	from	.
most	people	that	are	 follow 	 ing 	 	the	story	of	angelina	jolie	and	brad	pitt	will	know	where	namibia	is	.
they	love	namibia	for	 it 	 s 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 dune 	 s 	 	,	that	are	even	 tall 	 er 	 	than	the	empire	state	building	.
wind	and	time	have	 twist 	 ed 	 	our	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	strange	 shape 	 s 	 	,
and	these	 shape 	 s 	 	are	 s 	 peck 	 led 	 	with	 wild 	 life 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	so	 adapt 	 ed 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	harsh	and	strange	land	.
i	'm	a	himba	.
you	might	wonder	,	why	are	you	 wear 	 ing 	 	these	western	 clothe 	 s 	 	?
i	'm	a	himba	and	namibian	.
a	himba	is	one	of	the	29	ethnic	 group 	 s 	 	in	namibia	.
we	live	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 tradition 	 al 	 	 life 	 style 	 	.
i	grew	up	 herd 	 ing 	 	,	looking	after	our	 live 	 stock 	 	--	 goat 	 s 	 	,	sheep	and	cattle	.
and	one	day	,	my	father	 actual 	 ly 	 	took	me	 in 	 to 	 	the	bush	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	john	,	i	want	you	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	good	 herd 	 er 	 	.
boy	,	if	you	are	looking	after	our	 live 	 stock 	 	and	you	see	a	cheetah	eating	our	goat	--	cheetah	is	 ver 	 y 	 	nervous	--	just	walk	up	to	it	.
walk	up	to	it	and	 s 	 mack 	 	it	on	the	 back 	 side 	 	.	``	``	and	he	will	let	go	of	the	goat	and	run	off	.	``	but	then	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	boy	,	if	you	run	 in 	 to 	 	a	lion	,	do	n't	move	.
do	n't	move	.	stand	your	ground	.
puff	up	and	just	look	it	in	the	eye
and	it	may	not	want	to	fight	you	.	``	but	then	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	if	you	see	a	leopard	,	boy	,	you	better	run	like	hell	.	``	``	imagine	you	run	 fast 	 er 	 	than	 t 	 hose 	 	 goat 	 s 	 	you	are	looking	after	.	``	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	--	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	,	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	to	learn	about	nature	.
in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	 be 	 ing 	 	an	 ordin 	 ary 	 	namibian	and	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	 be 	 ing 	 	a	himba	i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	a	trained	 conserv 	 ation 	 ist 	 	.
and	it	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	if	you	are	in	the	field	to	know	what	to	confront	and	what	to	run	from	.
i	was	born	in	1971	.
we	lived	under	apartheid	regime	.
the	 white 	 s 	 	could	farm	,	graze	and	hunt	 a 	 s 	 	they	 wish 	 ed 	 	,
but	we	black	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	not	 regard 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 respons 	 ible 	 	to	use	 wild 	 life 	 	.
 when 	 ever 	 	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	hunt	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 poacher 	 s 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 fin 	 ed 	 	and	 lock 	 ed 	 	up	in	jail	.
between	1966	and	1990	,	the	u.s.	and	soviet	 interest 	 s 	 	 f 	 ought 	 	for	control	over	my	country	.
and	you	know	,	 dur 	 ing 	 	war	time	,	there	are	 militar 	 ies 	 	,	 arm 	 ies 	 	,	that	are	moving	around	.
and	the	 arm 	 y 	 	 hunt 	 ed 	 	for	 valu 	 able 	 	rhino	 horn 	 s 	 	and	 tusk 	 s 	 	.
they	could	sell	these	 thing 	 s 	 	for	 any 	 thing 	 	between	$	5,000	a	kilo	.
 dur 	 ing 	 	the	same	year	 al 	 most 	 	every	himba	had	a	rifle	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	 war 	 time 	 	,	the	british	.303	rifle	was	just	all	over	the	whole	country	.
then	in	the	same	time	,	around	1980	,	we	had	a	 ver 	 y 	 	big	drought	.	it	 kill 	 ed 	 	 al 	 most 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	that	was	left	.
our	 live 	 stock 	 	was	 al 	 most 	 	at	the	 br 	 ink 	 	of	 extinct 	 ion 	 	,	 protect 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 hung 	 ry 	 	.
i	remember	a	night	when	a	 hung 	 ry 	 	leopard	went	 in 	 to 	 	the	house	of	one	of	our	 neighbor 	 s 	 	and	took	a	 sleep 	 ing 	 	child	out	of	the	bed	.
it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 ad 	 	story	.
but	even	 to 	 day 	 	,	that	 memor 	 y 	 	is	still	in	people	's	 mind 	 s 	 	.
they	can	 pin 	 point 	 	the	exact	location	where	 th 	 is 	 	all	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
and	then	,	in	the	same	year	,	we	 al 	 most 	 	lost	 every 	 thing 	 	.
and	my	father	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	why	do	n't	you	just	go	to	school	?	``	and	they	 s 	 ent 	 	me	off	to	school	,	just	to	get	 bus 	 y 	 	 some 	 where 	 	there	.
and	the	year	i	went	to	school	,	my	father	 actual 	 ly 	 	got	a	job	with	a	non	-	 government 	 al 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	irdnc	,	 integrate 	 d 	 	 r 	 ural 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	and	nature	 conserv 	 ation 	 	.
they	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 pend 	 	a	lot	of	time	a	year	in	the	 commun 	 ities 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 trust 	 ed 	 	by	the	local	 commun 	 ities 	 	like	our	 lead 	 er 	 	,	joshua	kangombe	.
joshua	kangombe	saw	what	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	:	 wild 	 life 	 	 disappear 	 ing 	 	,	 po 	 ach 	 ing 	 	was	 skyrocket 	 ing 	 	,	and	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	 seem 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 hope 	 less 	 	.
death	and	despair	 surround 	 ed 	 	joshua	and	our	entire	 commun 	 ities 	 	.
but	then	,	the	people	from	irdnc	 pro 	 posed 	 	to	joshua	:	what	if	we	pay	people	that	you	trust	to	look	after	 wild 	 life 	 	?
do	you	have	 any 	 body 	 	in	your	 commun 	 ities 	 	,	or	people	,	that	know	the	bush	 ver 	 y 	 	well	and	that	know	 wild 	 life 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	well	?
the	 head 	 man 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	:	``	 y 	 es 	 	.	our	 poacher 	 s 	 	.	``	``	eh	?	the	 poacher 	 s 	 	?	``	``	 y 	 es 	 	.	our	 poacher 	 s 	 	.	``	and	that	was	my	father	.
my	father	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	poacher	for	 quit 	 e 	 	a	long	time	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	 shoot 	 ing 	 	 poacher 	 s 	 	dead	like	they	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 else 	 where 	 	in	africa	,	irdnc	 ha 	 s 	 	 help 	 ed 	 	men	 re 	 claim 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	abilities	to	manage	 the 	 ir 	 	 people 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 right 	 s 	 	to	own	and	manage	 wild 	 life 	 	.
and	thus	,	 a 	 s 	 	people	 start 	 ed 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	 owner 	 ship 	 	over	 wild 	 life 	 	,	 wild 	 life 	 	 number 	 s 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	coming	back	,	and	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 coming 	 	a	 found 	 ation 	 	for	 conserv 	 ation 	 	in	namibia	.
with	 in 	 depend 	 ence 	 	,	the	whole	approach	of	community	 get 	 ting 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	was	 embrace 	 d 	 	by	our	new	government	.
three	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	help	to	build	on	 th 	 is 	 	 found 	 ation 	 	:	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	one	is	 honor 	 ing 	 	of	tradition	and	 be 	 ing 	 	open	to	new	 idea 	 s 	 	.
here	is	our	tradition	:
at	every	himba	village	,	there	is	a	sacred	fire	.
and	at	 th 	 is 	 	sacred	fire	,	the	spirit	of	our	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	speak	through	the	 head 	 man 	 	and	advise	us	where	to	get	water	,	where	to	get	 grazing 	 s 	 	,	and	where	to	go	and	hunt	.
and	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	best	way	of	 regulat 	 ing 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	on	the	environment	.
and	here	are	the	new	 idea 	 s 	 	.
 transport 	 ing 	 	 rhino 	 s 	 	using	 helicopter 	 s 	 	i	think	is	much	 eas 	 ier 	 	than	 talk 	 ing 	 	through	a	spirit	that	you	ca	n't	see	,	is	n't	it	?
and	these	 thing 	 s 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	taught	by	 out 	 sider 	 s 	 	.
we	 learn 	 ed 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	from	 out 	 sider 	 s 	 	.
we	 need 	 ed 	 	new	 bound 	 aries 	 	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	our	 tradition 	 al 	 	 land 	 s 	 	;	we	 need 	 ed 	 	to	learn	more	 thing 	 s 	 	like	gps	just	to	see	 whet 	 her 	 	--	can	gps	 re 	 ally 	 	reflect	the	true	 reflect 	 ion 	 	of	the	land	or	is	 th 	 is 	 	just	a	thing	made	 some 	 where 	 	in	the	west	?
and	we	then	 want 	 ed 	 	to	see	 whet 	 her 	 	we	can	match	our	 ance 	 stral 	 	 map 	 s 	 	with	digital	 map 	 s 	 	made	 some 	 where 	 	in	the	world	.
and	through	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	 real 	 izing 	 	our	 dream 	 s 	 	,	and	we	 maintain 	 ed 	 	 honor 	 ing 	 	our	 tradition 	 s 	 	but	we	 we 	 re 	 	still	open	to	new	 idea 	 s 	 	.
the	second	element	is	that	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	have	a	life	,	a	better	life	where	we	can	benefit	through	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
most	 poacher 	 s 	 	,	like	my	father	,	 we 	 re 	 	people	from	our	own	community	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	not	people	from	 out 	 side 	 	.
these	 we 	 re 	 	our	own	people	.
and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	once	they	 we 	 re 	 	caught	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 treat 	 ed 	 	with	respect	,	 br 	 ought 	 	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	 commun 	 ities 	 	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	made	part	of	the	 big 	 ger 	 	 dream 	 s 	 	.
the	best	one	,	like	my	father	--	i	'm	not	 campaign 	 ing 	 	for	my	father	--	they	 we 	 re 	 	put	in	charge	to	stop	 other 	 s 	 	from	 po 	 ach 	 ing 	 	.
and	when	 th 	 is 	 	thing	 start 	 ed 	 	going	on	,	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 be 	 coming 	 	one	community	,	 renew 	 ing 	 	our	 connect 	 ion 	 	to	nature	.
and	that	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	thing	in	namibia	.
the	last	element	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 help 	 ed 	 	develop	these	 thing 	 s 	 	was	the	 partner 	 ship 	 s 	 	.
our	government	 ha 	 s 	 	 give 	 n 	 	legal	 stat 	 us 	 	over	our	 tradition 	 al 	 	 land 	 s 	 	.
the	other	 partner 	 s 	 	that	we	have	got	is	business	 commun 	 ities 	 	.
business	 commun 	 ities 	 	 help 	 ed 	 	 br 	 ing 	 	namibia	onto	the	world	map	and	they	have	 al 	 so 	 	 help 	 ed 	 	make	 wild 	 life 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 valu 	 able 	 	land	use	like	any	other	land	uses	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 agricultur 	 e 	 	.
and	most	of	my	 conserv 	 ation 	 	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	that	you	find	in	namibia	have	 be 	 en 	 	trained	through	the	 initi 	 ative 	 	,	through	the	 involve 	 ment 	 	of	world	 wild 	 life 	 	fund	in	the	most	up	-	to	-	date	 conserv 	 ation 	 	 practice 	 s 	 	.
they	have	 al 	 so 	 	 give 	 n 	 	 fund 	 ing 	 	for	two	 decade 	 s 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	whole	program	.
and	so	far	,	with	the	support	of	world	 wild 	 life 	 	fund	,	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	scale	up	the	 ver 	 y 	 	small	 program 	 s 	 	to	national	 program 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
namibia	...	or	sesfontein	was	no	more	an	 isolate 	 d 	 	village	 some 	 where 	 	,	 hid 	 den 	 	away	in	namibia	.
with	these	 asset 	 s 	 	we	are	now	part	of	the	global	village	.
thirty	 year 	 s 	 	have	 pass 	 ed 	 	since	my	father	's	first	job	 a 	 s 	 	a	community	game	guard	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 fortunate 	 	that	he	 pass 	 ed 	 	away	and	he	can	not	see	the	success	 a 	 s 	 	i	and	my	children	see	it	 to 	 day 	 	.
when	i	 finish 	 ed 	 	school	in	1995	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	20	 lion 	 s 	 	in	the	entire	 north 	 west 	 	--	in	our	area	.
but	 to 	 day 	 	,	there	are	more	than	130	 lion 	 s 	 	.
so	 pleas 	 e 	 	,	if	you	go	to	namibia	,	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	you	stay	in	the	 tent 	 s 	 	.
do	n't	walk	out	at	night	!
the	black	rhino	--	they	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 most 	 	extinct	in	1982	.
but	 to 	 day 	 	,	kunene	 ha 	 s 	 	the	largest	 concent 	 ration 	 	of	black	rhino	--	free	-	 roam 	 ing 	 	black	 rhino 	 s 	 	--	in	the	world	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 out 	 side 	 	the	 protect 	 ed 	 	area	.
the	leopard	--	they	are	now	in	big	 number 	 s 	 	but	they	are	now	far	away	from	our	village	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	natural	plain	 ha 	 s 	 	 multi 	 plied 	 	,	like	 zebra 	 s 	 	,	 spring 	 bo 	 k 	 s 	 	and	 every 	 thing 	 	.
they	stay	 ver 	 y 	 	much	far	away	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	other	thing	 ha 	 s 	 	 multi 	 plied 	 	from	less	than	a	thousand	to	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 animal 	 s 	 	.
what	 start 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	small	,	community	 rang 	 ers 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	community	 involve 	 d 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	now	grown	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	call	 conserv 	 ancies 	 	.
 conserv 	 ancies 	 	are	 legal 	 ly 	 	 institute 	 d 	 	 institution 	 s 	 	by	the	government	,	and	these	are	run	by	the	 commun 	 ities 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	for	 the 	 ir 	 	benefit	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	we	have	got	60	 conserv 	 ancies 	 	that	manage	and	protect	over	13	million	 hectare 	 s 	 	of	land	in	namibia	.
we	have	 al 	 ready 	 	 re 	 shaped 	 	 conserv 	 ation 	 	in	the	entire	country	.
 no 	 where 	 	else	in	the	world	 ha 	 s 	 	community	-	 adopt 	 ed 	 	 conserv 	 ation 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	scale	.
in	2008	,	 conserv 	 ancy 	 	generated	5.7	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	our	new	 eco 	 nomy 	 	--	an	 eco 	 nomy 	 	based	on	the	respect	of	our	natural	 resource 	 s 	 	.
and	we	are	able	to	use	 th 	 is 	 	money	for	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	:
 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	we	put	it	in	education	.
 second 	 ly 	 	,	we	put	it	for	 infra 	 structure 	 	.	food	.
 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	--	we	invest	 th 	 is 	 	money	in	 aid 	 s 	 	and	hiv	education	.
you	know	that	africa	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 affect 	 ed 	 	by	these	viruses	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	good	news	from	africa	that	we	have	to	shout	from	the	 roof 	 top 	 s 	 	.
and	now	,	what	the	world	 re 	 ally 	 	 need 	 s 	 	is	for	you	to	help	me	and	our	 partner 	 s 	 	take	some	of	what	we	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	in	namibia	to	other	 place 	 s 	 	with	similar	 problem 	 s 	 	:	 place 	 s 	 	like	mongolia	,	or	even	in	your	own	 back 	 yard 	 s 	 	,	the	 north 	 ern 	 	great	 plain 	 s 	 	,	where	buffalo	and	other	 animal 	 s 	 	have	 suffer 	 ed 	 	and	 man 	 y 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	are	in	decline	.
i	like	that	one	:	namibia	 serv 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	model	to	africa	,	and	africa	 serv 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	model	to	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	in	namibia	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 dream 	 ed 	 	of	a	future	that	was	much	more	than	just	a	 health 	 y 	 	 wild 	 life 	 	.
we	 k 	 new 	 	 conserv 	 ation 	 	would	fail	if	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	to	improve	the	 live 	 s 	 	of	the	local	 commun 	 ities 	 	.
