and	the	 anthropo 	 logist 	 	randall	white	 ha 	 s 	 	made	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 observ 	 ation 	 	:	that	if	our	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	40,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	had	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	see	what	they	had	 d 	 one 	 	,	they	would	n't	have	 re 	 ally 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	it	.	they	 we 	 re 	 	 respond 	 ing 	 	to	 im 	 mediate 	 	 concern 	 s 	 	.	they	 we 	 re 	 	making	it	possible	for	us	to	do	what	they	do	,	and	yet	,	they	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	understand	how	they	did	it	.
now	let	's	advance	to	10,000	 year 	 s 	 	before	the	present	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	when	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 get 	 s 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
what	about	the	 domestic 	 ation 	 	of	 grain 	 s 	 	?
what	about	the	 origin 	 s 	 	of	 agricultur 	 e 	 	?
what	would	our	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	10,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	have	 s 	 aid 	 
if	they	 re 	 ally 	 	had	technology	 assess 	 ment 	 	?	and	i	could	just	imagine	the	 commit 	 tee 	 s 	 	 report 	 ing 	 	back	to	them	on	where	 agricultur 	 e 	 	was	going	to	take	 human 	 ity 	 	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	in	the	next	few	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	.
it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	news	.
first	of	all	,	 wo 	 rse 	 	nutrition	,	 may 	 be 	 	 short 	 er 	 	life	 span 	 s 	 	.
it	was	 simpl 	 y 	 	awful	for	women	.

and	 politic 	 ally 	 	,	it	was	awful	.
it	was	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	a	much	 high 	 er 	 	degree	of	 ine 	 quality 	 	among	people	.
if	there	had	 be 	 en 	 	rational	technology	 assess 	 ment 	 	then	,	i	think	they	 ver 	 y 	 	well	might	have	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	let	's	call	the	whole	thing	off	.	``	even	now	,	our	 choice 	 s 	 	are	 hav 	 ing 	 	 un 	 intend 	 ed 	 	 effect 	 s 	 	.

there	is	evidence	that	the	human	mouth	and	 tee 	 th 	 	are	growing	 small 	 er 	 	all	the	time	.
that	's	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	a	bad	 un 	 intend 	 ed 	 	 con 	 sequence 	 	.
but	i	think	from	the	point	of	view	of	a	neanderthal	,	there	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	a	lot	of	 dis 	 approval 	 	of	the	 wimp 	 ish 	 	 chop 	 per 	 s 	 	that	we	now	have	.	so	these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	kind	of	 relat 	 ive 	 	to	where	you	or	your	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	happen	to	stand	.
in	the	ancient	world	there	was	a	lot	of	respect	for	 un 	 intend 	 ed 	 	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	,	and	there	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 health 	 y 	 	sense	of	caution	,	 reflect 	 ed 	 	in	the	tree	of	knowledge	,	in	pandora	's	box	,	and	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	in	the	myth	of	prometheus	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	so	 import 	 ant 	 	in	 re 	 cent 	 	 metaphor 	 s 	 	about	technology	.	and	that	's	all	 ver 	 y 	 	true	.
the	 physician 	 s 	 	of	the	ancient	world	--	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	the	egyptians	,	who	 start 	 ed 	 	medicine	 a 	 s 	 	we	know	it	--	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	conscious	of	what	they	could	and	could	n't	treat	.
and	the	 transl 	 ations 	 	of	the	 surviv 	 ing 	 	 text 	 s 	 	say	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	i	will	not	treat	.	 th 	 is 	 	i	can	not	treat	.	``
they	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	conscious	.
so	 we 	 re 	 	the	 follow 	 ers 	 	of	hippocrates	.

but	he	did	his	best	,	and	he	 ke 	 pt 	 	meticulous	 record 	 s 	 	that	let	him	transform	that	branch	of	medicine	.
now	if	we	look	forward	a	bit	to	the	19th	century	,	we	find	a	new	style	of	technology	.
what	we	find	is	,	no	 long 	 er 	 	simple	 tool 	 s 	 	,	but	 system 	 s 	 	.
we	find	more	and	more	complex	 arrange 	 ments 	 	of	 machine 	 s 	 	that	make	it	 hard 	 er 	 	and	 hard 	 er 	 	to	 diagnos 	 e 	 	what	's	going	on	.
and	the	first	people	who	saw	that	 we 	 re 	 	the	 tele 	 graph 	 ers 	 	of	the	mid	-	19th	century	,
who	 we 	 re 	 	the	original	 hack 	 ers 	 	.
thomas	edison	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 comfort 	 able 	 	in	the	atmosphere	of	a	 soft 	 ware 	 	firm	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	these	 hack 	 ers 	 	had	a	word	for	 t 	 hose 	 	 myster 	 ious 	 	 bug 	 s 	 	in	 tele 	 graph 	 	 system 	 s 	 	that	they	 call 	 ed 	 	 bug 	 s 	 	.
that	was	the	origin	of	the	word	``	bug	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	 conscious 	 ness 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	was	a	little	 s 	 low 	 	to	seep	through	the	general	population	,	even	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	well	 inform 	 ed 	 	.
samuel	clemens	,	mark	 tw 	 ain 	 	,	was	a	big	 invest 	 or 	 	in	the	most	complex	machine	of	all	 time 	 s 	 	--	at	 l 	 east 	 	 un 	 til 	 	1918	--	 register 	 ed 	 	with	the	u.s.	patent	 off 	 ice 	 	.
that	was	the	paige	 type 	 setter 	 	.
the	paige	 type 	 setter 	 	had	18,000	 part 	 s 	 	.
the	patent	had	64	 page 	 s 	 	of	text	and	271	 figure 	 s 	 	.
it	was	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	machine	 be 	 cause 	 	it	did	 every 	 thing 	 	that	a	human	 be 	 ing 	 	did	in	setting	type	--	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 return 	 ing 	 	the	type	to	 it 	 s 	 	place	,	which	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	thing	.
and	mark	 tw 	 ain 	 	,	who	 k 	 new 	 	all	about	 type 	 setting 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	was	smitten	by	 th 	 is 	 	machine	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	he	was	smitten	in	more	ways	than	one	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	made	him	bankrupt	,	and	he	had	to	tour	the	world	 s 	 peaking 	 	to	 re 	 coup 	 	his	money	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	an	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	about	19th	century	technology	,	that	all	these	 relationship 	 s 	 	among	 part 	 s 	 	could	make	the	most	 brilli 	 ant 	 	idea	fall	 a 	 part 	 	,	even	when	 judg 	 ed 	 	by	the	most	expert	people	.
now	there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	else	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	in	the	early	20th	century	that	made	 thing 	 s 	 	even	more	 complic 	 ated 	 	.
and	that	was	that	 safe 	 ty 	 	technology	 it 	 self 	 	could	be	a	source	of	danger	.
the	 less 	 on 	 	of	the	 titan 	 ic 	 	,	for	a	lot	of	the	 con 	 tempor 	 aries 	 	,	was	that	you	must	have	 en 	 ough 	 	 life 	 boat 	 s 	 	for	 every 	 one 	 	on	the	ship	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	result	of	the	tragic	loss	of	 live 	 s 	 	of	people	who	could	not	get	 in 	 to 	 	them	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	there	was	 an 	 other 	 	case	,	the	eastland	,	a	ship	that	 cap 	 sized 	 	in	chicago	harbor	in	1915	,	and	it	 kill 	 ed 	 	841	people	--	that	was	14	more	than	the	passenger	toll	of	the	 titan 	 ic 	 	.
the	reason	for	it	,	in	part	,	was	the	extra	life	 boat 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 add 	 ed 	 	that	made	 th 	 is 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	 un 	 s 	 table 	 	ship	even	more	 un 	 s 	 table 	 	.
and	that	 aga 	 in 	 	 prove 	 s 	 	that	when	you	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 un 	 intend 	 ed 	 	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	,	it	's	not	that	easy	to	know	the	right	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	to	draw	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	a	question	of	the	system	,	how	the	ship	was	 load 	 ed 	 	,	the	 ball 	 ast 	 	and	 man 	 y 	 	other	 thing 	 s 	 	.
so	the	20th	century	,	then	,	saw	how	much	more	complex	 re 	 ality 	 	was	,	but	it	 al 	 so 	 	saw	a	positive	side	.
it	saw	that	 invent 	 ion 	 	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	benefit	from	 emerge 	 ncies 	 	.
it	could	benefit	from	 tra 	 ged 	 ies 	 	.
and	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	that	--	which	is	not	 re 	 ally 	 	 wide 	 ly 	 	known	 a 	 s 	 	a	 techno 	 logical 	 	miracle	,	but	it	may	be	one	of	the	 great 	 est 	 	of	all	 time 	 s 	 	,	was	the	 scal 	 ing 	 	up	of	 pen 	 icillin 	 	in	the	second	world	war	.
 pen 	 icillin 	 	was	 discover 	 ed 	 	in	1928	,	but	even	by	1940	,	no	 commercial 	 ly 	 	and	 medical 	 ly 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	 quant 	 ities 	 	of	it	 we 	 re 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 produce 	 d 	 	.
a	number	of	pharmaceutical	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	it	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	it	 in 	 dependent 	 ly 	 	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 get 	 ting 	 	 any 	 where 	 	.
and	the	government	research	bureau	 br 	 ought 	 	 represent 	 ative 	 s 	 	together	and	told	them	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 d 	 one 	 	.
and	not	 on 	 ly 	 	did	they	do	it	,	but	 with 	 in 	 	two	 year 	 s 	 	,	they	 scale 	 d 	 	up	 pen 	 icillin 	 	from	 pre 	 par 	 ation 	 	in	one	-	liter	 flask 	 s 	 	to	10,000	-	gallon	 va 	 ts 	 	.	that	was	how	 quick 	 ly 	 	 pen 	 icillin 	 	was	 produce 	 d 	 	and	 be 	 came 	 	one	of	the	 great 	 est 	 	medical	 advance 	 s 	 	of	all	time	.
in	the	second	world	war	,	too	,	the	 exist 	 ence 	 	of	solar	 radi 	 ation 	 	was	 demonst 	 rated 	 	by	 stud 	 ies 	 	of	 inter 	 ference 	 	that	was	 detect 	 ed 	 	by	the	radar	 station 	 s 	 	of	great	britain	.
so	there	 we 	 re 	 	 benefit 	 s 	 	in	 calam 	 ities 	 	--	 benefit 	 s 	 	to	 pur 	 e 	 	science	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	to	 appli 	 ed 	 	science	and	medicine	.
now	when	we	come	to	the	period	after	the	second	world	war	,	 un 	 intend 	 ed 	 	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	get	even	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
and	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	that	 occur 	 red 	 	 begin 	 ning 	 	in	1976	,	when	it	was	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	the	bacteria	 caus 	 ing 	 	legionnaires	disease	had	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	present	in	natural	 water 	 s 	 	,	but	it	was	the	precise	temperature	of	the	water	in	 heat 	 ing 	 	,	 ventil 	 ating 	 	and	air	 condition 	 ing 	 	 system 	 s 	 	that	raised	the	right	temperature	for	the	 maxim 	 um 	 	 re 	 production 	 	of	legionella	bacillus	.	well	,	technology	to	the	 rescu 	 e 	 	.
so	 chemist 	 s 	 	got	to	work	,	and	they	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	 bacter 	 icide 	 	that	 be 	 came 	 	 wide 	 ly 	 	used	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 system 	 s 	 	.
but	 some 	 thing 	 	else	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	early	1980s	,	of	 failure 	 s 	 	of	tape	 drive 	 s 	 	all	over	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
and	ibm	,	which	made	them	,	just	did	n't	know	what	to	do	.
they	 commission 	 ed 	 	a	group	of	 the 	 ir 	 	best	 scientist 	 s 	 	to	investigate	,	and	what	they	found	was	that	all	these	tape	 drive 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 locate 	 d 	 	near	 ventil 	 ation 	 	 duct 	 s 	 	.	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	was	the	 bacter 	 icide 	 	was	 formula 	 ted 	 	with	minute	 trace 	 s 	 	of	tin	.
and	these	tin	 particle 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 deposit 	 ed 	 	on	the	tape	 head 	 s 	 	and	 we 	 re 	 	 crash 	 ing 	 	the	tape	 head 	 s 	 	.
so	they	 reform 	 ulated 	 	the	 bacter 	 icide 	 	.
but	what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	me	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	first	case	of	a	 mechanic 	 al 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	 suffer 	 ing 	 	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	 in 	 direct 	 ly 	 	,	from	a	human	disease	.
so	it	 show 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	all	in	 th 	 is 	 	together	.
in	fact	,	it	 al 	 so 	 	 show 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	that	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	our	 cap 	 abilities 	 	and	technology	have	 be 	 en 	 	 expand 	 ing 	 	 geo 	 metric 	 ally 	 	,	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	our	ability	to	model	 the 	 ir 	 	long	-	term	behavior	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 en 	 	increasing	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	increasing	 on 	 ly 	 	 arithmetic 	 ally 	 	.
so	one	of	the	 character 	 istic 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	of	our	time	is	how	to	close	 th 	 is 	 	gap	between	 cap 	 abilities 	 	and	 fore 	 sight 	 	.
one	other	 ver 	 y 	 	positive	 con 	 sequence 	 	of	20th	century	technology	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	was	the	way	in	which	other	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 calam 	 ities 	 	could	lead	to	positive	 advance 	 s 	 	.
there	are	two	 historian 	 s 	 	of	business	at	the	university	of	maryland	,	brent	goldfarb	and	david	kirsch	,	who	have	 d 	 one 	 	some	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	work	,	much	of	it	still	 un 	 publish 	 ed 	 	,	on	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	major	 innov 	 ations 	 	.
they	have	 combine 	 d 	 	the	list	of	major	 innov 	 ations 	 	,	and	they	've	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	the	 great 	 est 	 	number	,	the	 great 	 est 	 	decade	,	for	fundamental	 innov 	 ations 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 reflect 	 ed 	 	in	all	of	the	 list 	 s 	 	that	 other 	 s 	 	have	made	--	a	number	of	 list 	 s 	 	that	they	have	 merge 	 d 	 	--	was	the	great	 depress 	 ion 	 	.
and	 no 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	just	why	 th 	 is 	 	was	so	,	but	one	story	can	reflect	 some 	 thing 	 	of	it	.
it	was	the	origin	of	the	xerox	 cop 	 ier 	 	,	which	 celebr 	 ated 	 	 it 	 s 	 	50th	 annivers 	 ary 	 	last	year	.
and	chester	carlson	,	the	inventor	,	was	a	patent	attorney	.	he	 re 	 ally 	 	was	not	 intend 	 ing 	 	to	work	in	patent	research	,	but	he	could	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	find	an	 alter 	 native 	 	technical	job	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	best	job	he	could	get	.
he	was	 up 	 set 	 	by	the	low	quality	and	high	cost	of	 exist 	 ing 	 	patent	 re 	 production 	 s 	 	,	and	so	he	 start 	 ed 	 	to	develop	a	system	of	dry	 photo 	 copy 	 ing 	 	,	which	he	 patent 	 ed 	 	in	the	late	1930s	--	and	which	 be 	 came 	 	the	first	dry	 photo 	 cop 	 ier 	 	that	was	 commercial 	 ly 	 	practical	in	1960	.
so	we	see	that	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	these	 dis 	 location 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	people	 leav 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	original	 intend 	 ed 	 	 care 	 er 	 	and	going	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	else	where	 the 	 ir 	 	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	could	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	,	that	 depress 	 ions 	 	and	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	other	 un 	 fortunate 	 	 event 	 s 	 	can	have	a	 paradox 	 ically 	 	 stimul 	 ating 	 	effect	on	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	mean	?
it	 mean 	 s 	 	,	i	think	,	that	we	're	living	in	a	time	of	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	 possibil 	 ities 	 	.
think	of	the	financial	world	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
the	mentor	of	warren	buffett	,	benjamin	graham	,	 develop 	 ed 	 	his	system	of	value	 invest 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	his	own	 loss 	 es 	 	in	the	1929	crash	.
and	he	 publish 	 ed 	 	that	book	in	the	early	1930s	,	and	the	book	still	 exist 	 s 	 	in	further	 ed 	 ition 	 s 	 	and	is	still	a	fundamental	 text 	 book 	 	.
so	 man 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	creative	 thing 	 s 	 	can	happen	when	people	learn	from	 disaster 	 s 	 	.
now	think	of	the	large	and	small	 plague 	 s 	 	that	we	have	now	--	bed	 bug 	 s 	 	,	killer	bees	,	spam	--	and	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	possible	that	the	 solution 	 s 	 	to	 t 	 hose 	 	will	 re 	 ally 	 	extend	well	beyond	the	 im 	 mediate 	 	question	.
if	we	think	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	of	louis	pasteur	,	who	in	the	1860s	was	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	 stud 	 y 	 	the	 disease 	 s 	 	of	silk	 worm 	 s 	 	for	the	silk	industry	,	and	his	 discover 	 ies 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	germ	 theor 	 y 	 	of	disease	.
so	 ver 	 y 	 	often	,	some	kind	of	disaster	--	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	the	 con 	 sequence 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	of	over	-	 cultiv 	 ation 	 	of	silk	 worm 	 s 	 	,	which	was	a	problem	in	europe	at	the	time	--	can	be	the	key	to	 some 	 thing 	 	much	 big 	 ger 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	we	need	to	take	a	different	view	of	 un 	 intend 	 ed 	 	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	.
we	need	to	take	a	 re 	 ally 	 	positive	view	.
we	need	to	see	what	they	can	do	for	us	.
we	need	to	learn	from	 t 	 hose 	 	 figure 	 s 	 	that	i	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	.
we	need	to	learn	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	from	dr.	cushing	,	who	 kill 	 ed 	 	 patient 	 s 	 	in	the	course	of	his	early	 operation 	 s 	 	.
he	had	to	have	some	 error 	 s 	 	.	he	had	to	have	some	 mistak 	 es 	 	.
and	he	 learn 	 ed 	 	 meticulous 	 ly 	 	from	his	 mistak 	 es 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	,	when	we	say	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	brain	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	,	``	that	 pay 	 s 	 	tribute	to	how	difficult	it	was	for	 any 	 one 	 	to	learn	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 mistak 	 es 	 	in	a	field	of	medicine	that	was	 consider 	 ed 	 	so	 di 	 scour 	 aging 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	 prospect 	 s 	 	.
and	we	can	 al 	 so 	 	remember	how	the	pharmaceutical	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 will 	 ing 	 	to	pool	 the 	 ir 	 	knowledge	,	to	share	 the 	 ir 	 	knowledge	,	in	the	face	of	an	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	,	which	they	had	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 be 	 en 	 	for	 year 	 s 	 	and	 year 	 s 	 	.
they	might	have	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	do	it	 ear 	 lier 	 	.
the	 mess 	 age 	 	,	then	,	for	me	,	about	 un 	 intend 	 ed 	 	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	is	 cha 	 os 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	;	let	's	make	better	use	of	it	.
