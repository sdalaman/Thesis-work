i	'm	going	to	tell	you	a	little	bit	about	my	tedxhouston	talk	.
i	 wok 	 e 	 	up	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	after	i	 g 	 ave 	 	that	talk	with	the	worst	 vulner 	 ability 	 	 hang 	 over 	 	of	my	life	.
and	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	did	n't	 leav 	 e 	 	my	house	for	about	three	 day 	 s 	 	.
the	first	time	i	left	was	to	meet	a	friend	for	lunch	.
and	when	i	 walk 	 ed 	 	in	,	she	was	 al 	 ready 	 	at	the	table	.
and	i	 s 	 at 	 	down	,	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	god	,	you	look	like	hell	.	``	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 thank 	 s 	 	.	i	feel	 re 	 ally 	 	--	i	'm	not	 function 	 ing 	 	.	``	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	's	going	on	?	``	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	just	told	500	people	that	i	 be 	 came 	 	a	 research 	 er 	 	to	avoid	 vulner 	 ability 	 	.
and	that	when	 be 	 ing 	 	 vulner 	 able 	 	 emerge 	 d 	 	from	my	data	,	 a 	 s 	 	 absolute 	 ly 	 	essential	to	whole	-	hearted	living	,	i	told	these	500	people	that	i	had	a	 break 	 down 	 	.
i	had	a	slide	that	 s 	 aid 	 	 break 	 down 	 	.
at	what	point	did	i	think	that	was	a	good	idea	?	``	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	saw	your	talk	live	-	 stream 	 ed 	 	.
it	was	not	 re 	 ally 	 	you	.
it	was	a	little	different	than	what	you	 usual 	 ly 	 	do	.
but	it	was	great	.	``	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	ca	n't	happen	.

and	we	're	going	to	be	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	600	,	700	people	.	``	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	i	think	it	's	too	late	.	``	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	let	me	ask	you	 some 	 thing 	 	.	``	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	.	``	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	do	you	remember	when	we	 we 	 re 	 	in	college	and	 re 	 ally 	 	wild	and	kind	of	dumb	?	``	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	.	``	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	remember	when	we	'd	 leav 	 e 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	 mess 	 age 	 	on	our	ex	-	boyfriend	's	 answer 	 ing 	 	machine	?
then	we	'd	have	to	break	 in 	 to 	 	his	dorm	room	and	then	 er 	 ase 	 	the	tape	?	``	and	she	 go 	 es 	 	,	``	uh	...	no.	``	so	of	course	,	the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	i	could	think	of	to	say	at	that	point	was	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	,	me	 n 	 either 	 	.
that	...	me	 n 	 either 	 	.	``	and	i	'm	 think 	 ing 	 	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	``	brene	,	what	are	you	 do 	 ing 	 	?	what	are	you	 do 	 ing 	 	?
why	did	you	 br 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	up	?	have	you	lost	your	mind	?
your	 sister 	 s 	 	would	be	perfect	for	 th 	 is 	 	.	``
so	i	 look 	 ed 	 	back	up	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	are	you	 re 	 ally 	 	going	to	try	to	break	in	and	steal	the	video	before	they	put	it	on	youtube	?	``	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'm	just	 think 	 ing 	 	about	it	a	little	bit	.	``	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	're	like	the	worst	 vulner 	 ability 	 	role	model	ever	.	``	and	then	i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	her	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	at	the	time	felt	a	little	 dramat 	 ic 	 	,	but	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 be 	 ing 	 	more	 prophet 	 ic 	 	than	 dramat 	 ic 	 	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	if	500	 turn 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	1,000	or	2,000	,	my	life	is	over	.	``	i	had	no	 con 	 ting 	 ency 	 	plan	for	four	million	.
and	my	life	did	end	when	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
and	 may 	 be 	 	the	 hard 	 est 	 	part	about	my	life	 end 	 ing 	 	is	that	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	hard	about	 my 	 self 	 	,	and	that	was	that	,	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	i	would	 frust 	 rated 	 	about	not	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	get	my	work	out	to	the	world	,	there	was	a	part	of	me	that	was	 work 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	engineer	 stay 	 ing 	 	small	,	 stay 	 ing 	 	right	under	the	radar	.
but	i	want	to	talk	about	what	i	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	.
there	's	two	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	in	the	last	year	.
the	first	is	 vulner 	 ability 	 	is	not	 weak 	 ness 	 	.
and	that	myth	is	 pro 	 found 	 ly 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
let	me	ask	you	 honest 	 ly 	 	--	and	i	'll	give	you	 th 	 is 	 	 war 	 ning 	 	,	i	'm	trained	 a 	 s 	 	a	therapist	,	so	i	can	out	-	wait	you	 un 	 comfort 	 ably 	 	--	so	if	you	could	just	raise	your	hand	that	would	be	awesome	--	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	 honest 	 ly 	 	,	when	you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 vulner 	 able 	 	or	 say 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 vulner 	 able 	 	,	think	,	``	god	,	 vulner 	 ability 	 	's	 weak 	 ness 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 weak 	 ness 	 	?	``	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	think	of	 vulner 	 ability 	 	and	 weak 	 ness 	 	 synonymous 	 ly 	 	?
the	 major 	 ity 	 	of	people	.
now	let	me	ask	you	 th 	 is 	 	question	:	 th 	 is 	 	past	week	at	ted	,	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	,	when	you	saw	 vulner 	 ability 	 	up	here	,	thought	it	was	 pur 	 e 	 	courage	?
 vulner 	 ability 	 	is	not	 weak 	 ness 	 	.
i	define	 vulner 	 ability 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 emotion 	 al 	 	risk	,	 expo 	 s 	 ure 	 	,	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	.
it	 fuel 	 s 	 	our	 dai 	 ly 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
and	i	've	come	to	the	belief	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	12th	year	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	research	--	that	 vulner 	 ability 	 	is	our	most	accurate	 measure 	 ment 	 	of	courage	--	to	be	 vulner 	 able 	 	,	to	let	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	be	 s 	 een 	 	,	to	be	honest	.
one	of	the	weird	 thing 	 s 	 	that	's	 happen 	 ed 	 
is	,	after	the	ted	explosion	,	i	got	a	lot	of	 off 	 ers 	 	to	speak	all	over	the	country	--	 every 	 one 	 	from	 school 	 s 	 	and	parent	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	to	fortune	500	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.
and	so	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 call 	 s 	 	went	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	dr.	 brow 	 n 	 	.	we	 love 	 d 	 	your	tedtalk	.
we	'd	like	you	to	come	in	and	speak	.
we	'd	appreciate	it	if	you	would	n't	 ment 	 ion 	 	 vulner 	 ability 	 	or	shame	.	``	what	would	you	like	for	me	to	talk	about	?
there	's	three	big	 answer 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 most 	 ly 	 	,	to	be	honest	with	you	,	from	the	business	sector	:	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	and	change	.
so	let	me	go	on	the	record	and	say	,	 vulner 	 ability 	 	is	the	 birth 	 place 	 	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	and	change	.
to	create	is	to	make	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	never	 exist 	 ed 	 	before	.
there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	more	 vulner 	 able 	 	than	that	.
 adapt 	 ability 	 	to	change	is	all	about	 vulner 	 ability 	 	.
the	second	thing	,	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	 re 	 ally 	 	 final 	 ly 	 	 understand 	 ing 	 	the	relationship	between	 vulner 	 ability 	 	and	courage	,	the	second	thing	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	we	have	to	talk	about	shame	.
and	i	'm	going	to	be	 re 	 ally 	 	honest	with	you	.
when	i	 be 	 came 	 	a	``	 vulner 	 ability 	 	 research 	 er 	 	``	and	that	 be 	 came 	 	the	focus	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	tedtalk	--	and	i	'm	not	 kid 	 d 	 ing 	 	.
i	'll	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
about	three	 month 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	was	in	a	 s 	 port 	 ing 	 	 good 	 s 	 	store	 buy 	 ing 	 	 go 	 gg 	 les 	 	and	shin	 guard 	 s 	 	and	all	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 parent 	 s 	 	buy	at	the	 s 	 port 	 ing 	 	 good 	 s 	 	store	.
about	from	a	hundred	feet	away	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	hear	:	``	 vulner 	 ability 	 	ted	!	 vulner 	 ability 	 	ted	!	``	i	'm	a	fifth	generation	texan	.
our	family	 mot 	 to 	 	is	``	lock	and	load	.	``	i	am	not	a	natural	 vulner 	 ability 	 	 research 	 er 	 	.
so	i	'm	like	,	just	keep	 walk 	 ing 	 	,	she	's	on	my	six	.
and	then	i	hear	,	``	 vulner 	 ability 	 	ted	!	``	i	turn	around	,	i	go	,	``	hi	.	``	she	's	right	here	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	're	the	shame	 research 	 er 	 	who	had	the	 break 	 down 	 	.	``	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	 parent 	 s 	 	are	,	like	,	 pull 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	children	close	.
``	look	away	.	``	and	i	'm	so	worn	out	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	in	my	life	,	i	look	at	her	and	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	say	,	``	it	was	a	 f 	 rick 	 in 	 	'	spiritual	 awake 	 ning 	 	.	``	and	she	 look 	 s 	 	back	and	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	``	i	know	.	``	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	 watch 	 ed 	 	your	tedtalk	in	my	book	club	.
then	we	read	your	book	and	we	 re 	 named 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	'	the	 break 	 down 	 	 bab 	 es 	 	.	'	``	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	our	 tag 	 line 	 	is	:	'	we	're	 fall 	 ing 	 	 a 	 part 	 	and	it	 feel 	 s 	 	fantastic	.	'	``	you	can	 on 	 ly 	 	imagine	what	it	's	like	for	me	in	a	 facul 	 ty 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 	.
so	when	i	 be 	 came 	 	 vulner 	 ability 	 	ted	,	like	an	action	figure	--	like	 n 	 in 	 ja 	 	barbie	,	but	i	'm	 vulner 	 ability 	 	ted	--	i	thought	,	i	'm	going	to	 leav 	 e 	 	that	shame	stuff	 be 	 hind 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 s 	 pent 	 	six	 year 	 s 	 	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	shame	before	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	writing	and	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 vulner 	 ability 	 	.
and	i	thought	,	thank	god	,	 be 	 cause 	 	shame	is	 th 	 is 	 	 horr 	 ible 	 	 top 	 ic 	 	,	no	one	 want 	 s 	 	to	talk	about	it	.
it	's	the	best	way	to	shut	people	down	on	an	 air 	 plane 	 	.
``	what	do	you	do	?	``	``	i	 stud 	 y 	 	shame	.	``	``	oh	.	``	and	i	see	you	.	but	in	 surviv 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	last	year	,	i	was	 re 	 minded 	 	of	a	 card 	 in 	 al 	 	rule	--	not	a	research	rule	,	but	a	moral	 imper 	 ative 	 	from	my	 up 	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	--	you	've	got	to	dance	with	the	one	who	 br 	 ung 	 	ya	.
and	i	did	not	learn	about	 vulner 	 ability 	 	and	courage	and	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	and	 innov 	 ation 	 	from	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	 vulner 	 ability 	 	.
i	 learn 	 ed 	 	about	these	 thing 	 s 	 	from	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	shame	.
and	so	i	want	to	walk	you	in	to	shame	.
jungian	 analyst 	 s 	 	call	shame	the	 swamp 	 land 	 	of	the	soul	.
and	we	're	going	to	walk	in	.
and	the	purpose	is	not	to	walk	in	and	construct	a	home	and	live	there	.
it	is	to	put	on	some	 gal 	 osh 	 es 	 	and	walk	through	and	find	our	way	around	.
here	's	why	.	we	heard	the	most	 compel 	 ling 	 	call	ever	to	have	a	conversation	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	,	and	i	think	 global 	 ly 	 	,	around	race	,	right	?
 y 	 es 	 	?	we	heard	that	.
 y 	 es 	 	?
can	not	have	that	conversation	 with 	 out 	 	shame	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	can	not	talk	about	race	 with 	 out 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	privilege	.
and	when	people	start	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	privilege	,	they	get	 paralyze 	 d 	 	by	shame	.
we	heard	a	 brilli 	 ant 	 	simple	solution	to	not	 kill 	 ing 	 	people	in	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	,	which	is	have	a	 check 	 list 	 	.
you	ca	n't	fix	that	problem	 with 	 out 	 	 address 	 ing 	 	shame	,	 be 	 cause 	 	when	they	teach	 t 	 hose 	 	 folk 	 s 	 	how	to	 sutur 	 e 	 	,	they	 al 	 so 	 	teach	them	how	to	stitch	 the 	 ir 	 	self	-	worth	to	 be 	 ing 	 	all	-	 power 	 ful 	 	.
and	all	-	 power 	 ful 	 	 folk 	 s 	 	do	n't	need	 check 	 list 	 s 	 	.
and	i	had	to	write	down	the	name	of	 th 	 is 	 	ted	fellow	so	i	did	n't	mess	it	up	here	.
myshkin	ingawale	,	i	hope	i	did	right	by	you	.
i	saw	the	ted	 fellow 	 s 	 	my	first	day	here	.
and	he	got	up	and	he	 explain 	 ed 	 	how	he	was	driven	to	create	some	technology	to	help	test	for	 ane 	 mia 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	people	 we 	 re 	 	 dy 	 ing 	 	 un 	 necess 	 arily 	 	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	saw	 th 	 is 	 	need	.
so	you	know	what	i	did	?	i	made	it	.	``	and	 every 	 body 	 	just	burst	 in 	 to 	 	 app 	 laus 	 e 	 	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	like	``	 y 	 es 	 	!	``	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	and	it	did	n't	work	.
and	then	i	made	it	32	more	 time 	 s 	 	,	and	then	it	 work 	 ed 	 	.	``	you	know	what	the	big	secret	about	ted	is	?
i	ca	n't	wait	to	tell	people	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	guess	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	it	right	now	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	like	the	failure	 con 	 ference 	 	.
no	,	it	is	.
you	know	why	 th 	 is 	 	place	is	 amaz 	 ing 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	few	people	here	are	 af 	 raid 	 	to	fail	.
and	no	one	who	 get 	 s 	 	on	the	stage	,	so	far	that	i	've	 s 	 een 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 fail 	 ed 	 	.
i	've	 fail 	 ed 	 	 mis 	 er 	 ably 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	.
i	do	n't	think	the	world	 understand 	 s 	 	that	 be 	 cause 	 	of	shame	.
there	's	a	great	quote	that	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	me	 th 	 is 	 	past	year	by	theodore	roosevelt	.
a	lot	of	people	refer	to	it	 a 	 s 	 	the	``	man	in	the	arena	``	quote	.
and	it	 go 	 es 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	:	``	it	is	not	the	critic	who	 count 	 s 	 	.
it	is	not	the	man	who	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	and	 point 	 s 	 	out	how	the	 do 	 er 	 	of	 de 	 ed 	 s 	 	could	have	 d 	 one 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	better	and	how	he	 fall 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 tumble 	 s 	 	.	the	credit	 go 	 es 	 	to	the	man	in	the	arena	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	face	is	 mar 	 red 	 	with	dust	and	blood	and	sweat	.
but	when	he	's	in	the	arena	,	at	best	he	 win 	 s 	 	,	and	at	worst	he	 lose 	 s 	 	,	but	when	he	 fail 	 s 	 	,	when	he	 lose 	 s 	 	,	he	 do 	 es 	 	so	 da 	 ring 	 	 great 	 ly 	 	.	``
and	that	's	what	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	,	to	me	,	is	about	.
that	's	what	life	is	about	,	about	 da 	 ring 	 	 great 	 ly 	 	,	about	 be 	 ing 	 	in	the	arena	.
when	you	walk	up	to	that	arena	and	you	put	your	hand	on	the	door	,	and	you	think	,	``	i	'm	going	in	and	i	'm	going	to	try	 th 	 is 	 	,	``	shame	is	the	 gr 	 em 	 lin 	 	who	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	uh	,	uh	.
you	're	not	good	 en 	 ough 	 	.
you	never	 finish 	 ed 	 	that	mba	.	your	wife	left	you	.
i	know	your	dad	 re 	 ally 	 	was	n't	in	luxembourg	,	he	was	in	 s 	 ing 	 	 s 	 ing 	 	.
i	know	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	you	growing	up	.
i	know	you	do	n't	think	that	you	're	 pre 	 tty 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	or	smart	 en 	 ough 	 	or	 talent 	 ed 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	or	 power 	 ful 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	.
i	know	your	dad	never	paid	attention	,	even	when	you	made	cfo	.	``	shame	is	that	thing	.
and	if	we	can	quiet	it	down	and	walk	in	and	say	,	``	i	'm	going	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	``	we	look	up	and	the	critic	that	we	see	 point 	 ing 	 	and	 laugh 	 ing 	 	,	99	percent	of	the	time	is	who	?
us	.
shame	 drive 	 s 	 	two	big	 tape 	 s 	 	--	``	never	good	 en 	 ough 	 	``	and	,	if	you	can	talk	it	out	of	that	one	,	``	who	do	you	think	you	are	?	``	the	thing	to	understand	about	shame	is	it	's	not	guilt	.
shame	is	a	focus	on	self	,	guilt	is	a	focus	on	behavior	.
shame	is	``	i	am	bad	.	``	guilt	is	``	i	did	 some 	 thing 	 	bad	.	``	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	,	if	you	did	 some 	 thing 	 	that	was	 hurt 	 ful 	 	to	me	,	would	be	 will 	 ing 	 	to	say	,	``	i	'm	sorry	.	i	made	a	 mistak 	 e 	 	?	``	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	would	be	 will 	 ing 	 	to	say	that	?
guilt	:	i	'm	sorry	.	i	made	a	 mistak 	 e 	 	.
shame	:	i	'm	sorry	.	i	am	a	 mistak 	 e 	 	.
there	's	a	huge	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	shame	and	guilt	.
and	here	's	what	you	need	to	know	.
shame	is	 high 	 ly 	 	,	 high 	 ly 	 	 correlate 	 d 	 	with	 addict 	 ion 	 	,	 depress 	 ion 	 	,	violence	,	 aggress 	 ion 	 	,	 bull 	 y 	 ing 	 	,	 su 	 icide 	 	,	eating	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	.
and	here	's	what	you	even	need	to	know	more	.
guilt	,	 in 	 verse 	 ly 	 	 correlate 	 d 	 	with	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
the	ability	to	hold	 some 	 thing 	 	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	or	 fail 	 ed 	 	to	do	up	against	who	we	want	to	be	is	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 adapt 	 ive 	 	.
it	's	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	,	but	it	's	 adapt 	 ive 	 	.
the	other	thing	you	need	to	know	about	shame	is	it	's	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 organize 	 d 	 	by	gender	.
if	shame	 wash 	 es 	 	over	me	and	 wash 	 es 	 	over	chris	,	it	's	going	to	feel	the	same	.
 every 	 one 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	here	 know 	 s 	 	the	warm	wash	of	shame	.
we	're	 pre 	 tty 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	that	the	 on 	 ly 	 	people	who	do	n't	experience	shame	are	people	who	have	no	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	for	 connect 	 ion 	 	or	 empath 	 y 	 	.
which	 mean 	 s 	 	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	i	have	a	little	shame	;	no	,	i	'm	a	 socio 	 path 	 	.
so	i	would	opt	for	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	you	have	a	little	shame	.
shame	 feel 	 s 	 	the	same	for	men	and	women	,	but	it	's	 organize 	 d 	 	by	gender	.
for	women	,	the	best	 ex 	 ample 	 	i	can	give	you	is	enjoli	the	commercial	:	``	i	can	put	the	wash	on	the	line	,	pack	the	 lunch 	 es 	 	,	hand	out	the	 kiss 	 es 	 	and	be	at	work	at	five	to	nine	.
i	can	 br 	 ing 	 	home	the	 ba 	 con 	 	,	fry	it	up	in	the	pan	and	never	let	you	forget	you	're	a	man	.	``	for	women	,	shame	is	do	it	all	,	do	it	 perfect 	 ly 	 	and	never	let	them	see	you	sweat	.
i	do	n't	know	how	much	perfume	that	commercial	 s 	 old 	 	,	but	i	guarantee	you	,	it	 move 	 d 	 	a	lot	of	 anti 	 depress 	 ants 	 	and	anti	-	 anxie 	 ty 	 	 med 	 s 	 	.
shame	,	for	women	,	is	 th 	 is 	 	web	of	 un 	 obtain 	 able 	 	,	 conflict 	 ing 	 	,	 com 	 pet 	 ing 	 	 expect 	 ations 	 	about	who	we	're	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	.
and	it	's	a	straight	-	jacket	.
for	men	,	shame	is	not	a	bunch	of	 com 	 pet 	 ing 	 	,	 conflict 	 ing 	 	 expect 	 ations 	 	.
shame	is	one	,	do	not	be	 perceive 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	what	?	weak	.
i	did	not	interview	men	for	the	first	four	 year 	 s 	 	of	my	 stud 	 y 	 	.
and	it	was	n't	 un 	 til 	 	a	man	 look 	 ed 	 	at	me	one	day	after	a	book	 sign 	 ing 	 	,
 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	love	what	you	have	to	say	about	shame	,	i	'm	 cur 	 ious 	 	why	you	did	n't	 ment 	 ion 	 	men	.	``	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	do	n't	 stud 	 y 	 	men	.	``	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	that	's	convenient	.	``	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	why	?	``	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 be 	 cause 	 	you	say	to	reach	out	,	tell	our	story	,	be	 vulner 	 able 	 	.
but	you	see	 t 	 hose 	 	 book 	 s 	 	you	just	 sign 	 ed 	 	for	my	wife	and	my	three	 daughter 	 s 	 	?	``	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	.	``	``	they	'd	 ra 	 ther 	 	me	die	on	top	of	my	white	horse	than	watch	me	fall	down	.
when	we	reach	out	and	be	 vulner 	 able 	 	we	get	the	shit	beat	out	of	us	.
and	do	n't	tell	me	it	's	from	the	 guy 	 s 	 	and	the	 coach 	 es 	 	and	the	 dad 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	women	in	my	life	are	 hard 	 er 	 	on	me	than	 any 	 one 	 	else	.	``	so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 interview 	 ing 	 	men	and	 ask 	 ing 	 	 question 	 s 	 	.
and	what	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	you	show	me	a	woman	who	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 it 	 	with	a	man	in	real	 vulner 	 ability 	 	and	fear	,	i	'll	show	you	a	woman	who	's	 d 	 one 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	work	.
you	show	me	a	man	who	can	 s 	 it 	 	with	a	woman	who	's	just	had	it	,	she	ca	n't	do	it	all	 any 	 more 	 	,	and	his	first	 respons 	 e 	 	is	not	,	``	i	 un 	 load 	 ed 	 	the	 dish 	 wash 	 er 	 	,	``	but	he	 re 	 ally 	 	 listen 	 s 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	all	we	need	--	i	'll	show	you	a	guy	who	's	 d 	 one 	 	a	lot	of	work	.
shame	is	an	 epi 	 demic 	 	in	our	culture	.
and	to	get	out	from	 under 	 neath 	 	it	,	to	find	our	way	back	to	each	other	,	we	have	to	understand	how	it	 affect 	 s 	 	us	and	how	it	 affect 	 s 	 	the	way	we	're	 parent 	 ing 	 	,	the	way	we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	,	the	way	we	're	looking	at	each	other	.
 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	some	research	by	mahalik	at	boston	college	.
he	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	what	do	women	need	to	do	to	conform	to	female	 norm 	 s 	 	?
the	top	 answer 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	:	nice	,	thin	,	modest	and	use	all	 avail 	 able 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	for	 appear 	 ance 	 	.
when	he	 ask 	 ed 	 	about	men	,	what	do	men	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	need	to	do	to	conform	with	male	 norm 	 s 	 	,	the	 answer 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	:	 al 	 ways 	 	show	 emotion 	 al 	 	control	,	work	is	first	,	pursue	 stat 	 us 	 	and	violence	.
if	we	're	going	to	find	our	way	back	to	each	other	,	we	have	to	understand	and	know	 empath 	 y 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 empath 	 y 	 	's	the	antidote	to	shame	.
if	you	put	shame	in	a	 pe 	 tri 	 	dish	,	it	 need 	 s 	 	three	 thing 	 s 	 	to	grow	 exponential 	 ly 	 	:	secrecy	,	silence	and	judgment	.
if	you	put	the	same	amount	of	shame	in	a	 pe 	 tri 	 	dish	and	 do 	 use 	 	it	with	 empath 	 y 	 	,	it	ca	n't	 surviv 	 e 	 	.
the	two	most	 power 	 ful 	 	 word 	 s 	 	when	we	're	in	struggle	:	me	too	.
and	so	i	'll	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	 th 	 is 	 	thought	.	if	we	're	going	to	find	our	way	back	to	each	other	,	 vulner 	 ability 	 	is	going	to	be	that	path	.
and	i	know	it	's	 s 	 e 	 duct 	 ive 	 	to	stand	 out 	 side 	 	the	arena	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	i	did	it	my	whole	life	,	and	think	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	i	'm	going	to	go	in	there	and	kick	some	ass	when	i	'm	 bullet 	 proof 	 	and	when	i	'm	perfect	.
and	that	is	 s 	 e 	 duct 	 ive 	 	.
but	the	truth	is	that	never	 happen 	 s 	 	.
and	even	if	you	got	 a 	 s 	 	perfect	 a 	 s 	 	you	could	and	 a 	 s 	 	 bullet 	 proof 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	could	possibly	 must 	 er 	 	when	you	got	in	there	,	that	's	not	what	we	want	to	see	.
we	want	you	to	go	in	.
we	want	to	be	with	you	and	 a 	 cross 	 	from	you	.
and	we	just	want	,	for	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	the	people	we	care	about	and	the	people	we	work	with	,	to	 da 	 re 	 	 great 	 ly 	 	.
so	thank	you	all	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.	i	 re 	 ally 	 	appreciate	it	.
