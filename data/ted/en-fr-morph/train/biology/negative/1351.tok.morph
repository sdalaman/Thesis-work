both	 my 	 self 	 	and	my	brother	belong	to	the	under	30	 demo 	 graphic 	 	,	which	pat	 s 	 aid 	 	 make 	 s 	 	70	percent	,	but	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	our	 statistic 	 s 	 	it	 make 	 s 	 	60	percent	of	the	region	's	population	.
qatar	is	no	exception	to	the	region	.
it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	young	nation	led	by	young	people	.
we	have	 be 	 en 	 	 re 	 mini 	 s 	 c 	 ing 	 	about	the	 lat 	 est 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	and	the	ipods	,	and	for	me	the	abaya	,	my	 tradition 	 al 	 	dress	that	i	'm	 wear 	 ing 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	religious	 gar 	 ment 	 	,	nor	is	it	a	religious	 state 	 ment 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	it	's	a	 divers 	 e 	 	cultural	 state 	 ment 	 	that	we	 choos 	 e 	 	to	wear	.
now	i	remember	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	a	journalist	 ask 	 ed 	 	dr.	sheikha	,	who	's	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	here	,	 p 	 resident 	 	of	qatar	university	--	who	,	by	the	way	,	is	a	woman	--	he	 ask 	 ed 	 	her	 whet 	 her 	 	she	thought	the	abaya	 hind 	 er 	 ed 	 	or	 in 	 fringe 	 d 	 	her	 free 	 dom 	 	in	any	way	.
her	answer	was	 quit 	 e 	 	the	 contr 	 ary 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	she	felt	more	free	,	more	free	 be 	 cause 	 	she	could	wear	 what 	 ever 	 	she	 want 	 ed 	 	under	the	abaya	.
she	could	come	to	work	in	her	 pajama 	 s 	 	and	 no 	 body 	 	would	care	.
not	that	you	do	;	i	'm	just	 say 	 ing 	 	.
my	point	is	here	,	people	have	a	choice	--	just	like	the	indian	 lad 	 y 	 	could	wear	her	 s 	 ari 	 	or	the	japanese	woman	could	wear	her	 ki 	 mono 	 	.
we	are	changing	our	culture	from	 with 	 in 	 	,	but	at	the	same	time	we	are	 re 	 connect 	 ing 	 	with	our	 tradition 	 s 	 	.
we	know	that	 modern 	 ization 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
and	 y 	 es 	 	,	qatar	 want 	 s 	 	to	be	a	modern	nation	.
but	at	the	same	time	we	are	 re 	 connect 	 ing 	 	and	 re 	 assert 	 ing 	 	our	arab	heritage	.
it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	for	us	to	grow	 organ 	 ically 	 	.
and	we	 continu 	 ously 	 	make	the	conscious	decision	to	reach	that	balance	.
in	fact	,	research	 ha 	 s 	 	 show 	 n 	 	that	the	more	the	world	is	flat	,	if	i	use	tom	friedman	's	 analog 	 y 	 	,	or	global	,	the	more	and	more	people	are	 want 	 ing 	 	to	be	different	.
and	for	us	young	people	,	they	're	looking	to	 be 	 come 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	and	find	 the 	 ir 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	 among 	 st 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
which	is	why	i	prefer	the	richard	wilk	 analog 	 y 	 	of	 global 	 izing 	 	the	local	and	 local 	 izing 	 	the	global	.
we	do	n't	want	to	be	all	the	same	,	but	we	want	to	respect	each	other	and	understand	each	other	.
and	 there 	 fore 	 	tradition	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	more	 import 	 ant 	 	,	not	less	 import 	 ant 	 	.
life	 necess 	 itate 	 s 	 	a	universal	world	,	 how 	 ever 	 	,	we	 believ 	 e 	 	in	the	security	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	local	 ident 	 ity 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	the	 lead 	 ers 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	region	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	.
we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	be	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	global	village	,	but	at	the	same	time	we	're	 re 	 vis 	 ing 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	through	our	cultural	 institution 	 s 	 	and	cultural	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
i	'm	a	 represent 	 ation 	 	of	that	 phenomen 	 on 	 	.
and	i	think	a	lot	of	people	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	i	can	see	a	lot	of	you	are	in	the	same	position	 a 	 s 	 	 my 	 self 	 	.
and	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	we	ca	n't	see	the	people	in	washington	,	they	are	in	the	same	position	.
we	're	 continu 	 ously 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 straddl 	 e 	 	different	 world 	 s 	 	,	different	 culture 	 s 	 	and	 try 	 ing 	 	to	meet	the	 challeng 	 es 	 	of	a	different	 expect 	 ation 	 	from	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	from	 other 	 s 	 	.
so	i	want	to	ask	a	question	:	what	should	culture	in	the	21st	century	look	like	?
in	a	time	where	the	world	is	 be 	 coming 	 	 personal 	 ized 	 	,	when	the	mobile	phone	,	the	burger	,	the	 tele 	 phone 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	own	personal	 ident 	 ity 	 	,	how	should	we	perceive	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 
and	how	should	we	perceive	 other 	 s 	 	?
how	 do 	 es 	 	that	impact	our	desert	culture	?
i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	of	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	in	washington	are	aware	of	the	cultural	 develop 	 ments 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	the	region	and	,	the	more	 re 	 cent 	 	,	museum	of	islamic	art	 open 	 ed 	 	in	qatar	in	2008	.
i	 my 	 self 	 	am	 personal 	 izing 	 	these	cultural	 develop 	 ments 	 	,	but	i	 al 	 so 	 	understand	that	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 d 	 one 	 	 organ 	 ically 	 	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	we	do	have	all	the	 resource 	 s 	 	that	we	need	in	order	to	develop	new	cultural	 institution 	 s 	 	,	but	what	i	think	is	more	 import 	 ant 	 	is	that	we	are	 ver 	 y 	 	fortunate	to	have	 vision 	 ary 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	who	understand	that	 th 	 is 	 	ca	n't	happen	from	 out 	 side 	 	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	come	from	 with 	 in 	 	.
and	guess	what	?
you	might	be	 surprise 	 d 	 	to	know	that	most	people	in	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	who	are	 lead 	 ing 	 	these	cultural	 initi 	 ative 	 s 	 	happen	to	be	women	.
i	want	to	ask	you	,	why	do	you	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	?
is	it	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	a	soft	option	;	we	have	 noth 	 ing 	 	else	to	do	?
no	,	i	do	n't	think	so	.
i	think	that	women	in	 th 	 is 	 	part	of	the	world	 real 	 ize 	 	that	culture	is	an	 import 	 ant 	 	component	to	connect	people	both	 local 	 ly 	 	and	 region 	 ally 	 	.
it	's	a	natural	component	for	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	people	together	,	 discuss 	 ing 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	--	in	the	same	way	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	here	at	ted	.
we	're	here	,	we	're	part	of	a	community	,	sharing	out	 idea 	 s 	 	and	 discuss 	 ing 	 	them	.
art	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	part	of	our	national	 ident 	 ity 	 	.
the	existential	and	social	and	 politic 	 al 	 	impact	an	artist	 ha 	 s 	 	on	his	nation	's	 develop 	 ment 	 	of	cultural	 ident 	 ity 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
you	know	,	art	and	culture	is	big	business	.
ask	me	.
ask	the	 chair 	 person 	 s 	 	and	ceos	of	sotheby	's	and	christie	's	.
ask	charles	saatchi	about	great	art	.
they	make	a	lot	of	money	.
so	i	think	women	in	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	are	 be 	 coming 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 real 	 ize 	 	that	for	 the 	 ir 	 	future	 generation 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	maintain	our	cultural	 ident 	 ities 	 	.
why	else	do	greeks	demand	the	return	of	the	elgin	 mar 	 ble 	 s 	 	?
and	why	is	there	an	 up 	 roar 	 	when	a	private	 collect 	 or 	 	tries	to	sell	his	 collect 	 ion 	 	to	a	foreign	museum	?
why	 do 	 es 	 	it	take	me	 month 	 s 	 	on	end	to	get	an	export	 licens 	 e 	 	from	london	or	new	york	in	order	to	get	 piece 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	my	country	?
in	few	 hour 	 s 	 	,	shirin	neshat	,	my	friend	from	iran	who	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	artist	for	us	will	be	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	you	.
she	 live 	 s 	 	in	new	york	city	,	but	she	 do 	 es 	 	n't	try	to	be	a	western	artist	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	she	tries	to	engage	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 dial 	 ogue 	 	about	her	culture	,	nation	and	heritage	.
she	 do 	 es 	 	that	through	 import 	 ant 	 	visual	 form 	 s 	 	of	 photograph 	 y 	 	and	film	.
in	the	same	way	,	qatar	is	 try 	 ing 	 	to	grow	 it 	 s 	 	national	 museum 	 s 	 	through	an	 organ 	 ic 	 	process	from	 with 	 in 	 	.
our	mission	is	of	cultural	 integ 	 ration 	 	and	 in 	 depend 	 ence 	 	.
we	do	n't	want	to	have	what	there	is	in	the	west	.
we	do	n't	want	 the 	 ir 	 	 collect 	 ions 	 	.
we	want	to	build	our	own	 ident 	 ities 	 	,	our	own	fabric	,	create	an	open	 dial 	 ogue 	 	so	that	we	share	our	 idea 	 s 	 	and	share	 your 	 s 	 	with	us	.
in	a	few	 day 	 s 	 	,	we	will	be	 open 	 ing 	 	the	arab	museum	of	modern	art	.
we	have	 d 	 one 	 	 extens 	 ive 	 	research	to	ensure	that	arab	and	muslim	 artist 	 s 	 	,	and	arabs	who	are	not	muslims	--	not	all	arabs	are	muslims	,	by	the	way	--	but	we	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	they	are	 represent 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	new	institution	.
 th 	 is 	 	institution	is	government	-	 back 	 ed 	 	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	the	case	for	the	past	three	 decade 	 s 	 	.
we	will	open	the	museum	in	a	few	 day 	 s 	 	,	and	i	welcome	all	of	you	to	get	on	qatar	airways	and	come	and	join	us	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	museum	is	just	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	us	 a 	 s 	 	the	west	.
some	of	you	might	have	heard	of	the	algerian	artist	baya	mahieddine	,	but	i	doubt	a	lot	of	people	know	that	 th 	 is 	 	artist	 work 	 ed 	 	in	picasso	's	studio	in	paris	in	the	1930s	.
for	me	it	was	a	new	 discover 	 y 	 	.
and	i	think	with	time	,	in	the	 year 	 s 	 	to	come	we	'll	be	 learn 	 ing 	 	a	lot	about	our	picassos	,	our	legers	and	our	cezannes	.
we	do	have	 artist 	 s 	 	,	but	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	we	have	not	 discover 	 ed 	 	them	yet	.
now	visual	 express 	 ion 	 	is	just	one	form	of	culture	 integ 	 ration 	 	.
we	have	 real 	 ized 	 	that	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	more	and	more	people	are	using	the	 mean 	 s 	 	of	youtube	and	social	 network 	 ing 	 	to	express	 the 	 ir 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	,	share	 the 	 ir 	 	 photo 	 s 	 	and	tell	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 st 	 ories 	 	through	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 voice 	 s 	 	.
in	a	similar	way	,	we	have	 create 	 d 	 	the	doha	film	institute	.
now	the	doha	film	institute	is	an	 organ 	 ization 	 	to	teach	people	about	film	and	 film 	 making 	 	.
last	year	we	did	n't	have	one	qatari	woman	 film 	 maker 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	i	am	proud	to	say	we	have	trained	and	educated	over	66	qatari	women	 film 	 makers 	 	to	edit	,	tell	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 st 	 ories 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 voice 	 s 	 	.
now	if	you	'll	allow	me	,	i	would	love	to	share	a	one	-	minute	film	that	 ha 	 s 	 	proven	to	show	that	a	60	-	sec	film	can	be	 a 	 s 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	haiku	in	 tell 	 ing 	 	a	big	picture	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	our	 film 	 makers 	 	'	 product 	 s 	 	.
boy	:	 he 	 y 	 	listen	!	did	you	know	that	the	 stock 	 s 	 	are	up	?
who	are	you	 play 	 ing 	 	?
girl	:	uncle	khaled	.	here	,	put	on	the	 head 	 scar 	 f 	 	.
khaled	:	why	would	i	want	to	put	it	on	?
girl	:	do	 a 	 s 	 	you	're	told	,	young	girl	.
boy	:	no	,	you	play	mom	and	i	play	dad	.
play	by	 your 	 self 	 	then	.
girl	:	women	!	one	word	and	they	get	 up 	 set 	 	.
 use 	 less 	 	.
thank	you	.	thank	you	!
sm	:	going	back	to	 straddl 	 ing 	 	between	east	and	west	,	last	month	we	had	our	second	doha	tribeca	film	 fest 	 ival 	 	here	in	doha	.
the	doha	tribeca	film	 fest 	 ival 	 	was	held	at	our	new	cultural	hub	,	katara	.
it	 attract 	 ed 	 	42,000	people	,	and	we	 show 	 case 	 d 	 	51	 film 	 s 	 	.
now	the	doha	tribeca	film	 fest 	 ival 	 	is	not	an	 import 	 ed 	 	 fest 	 ival 	 	,	but	 ra 	 ther 	 	an	 import 	 ant 	 	 fest 	 ival 	 	between	the	cities	of	new	york	and	doha	.
it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	for	two	 thing 	 s 	 	.
first	,	it	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	 show 	 case 	 	our	arab	 film 	 makers 	 	and	 voice 	 s 	 	to	one	of	the	most	 cosmo 	 politan 	 	cities	in	the	world	,	new	york	city	.
at	the	same	time	,	we	are	 invit 	 ing 	 	them	to	come	and	explore	our	part	of	the	world	.
they	're	 learn 	 ing 	 	our	culture	,	our	language	,	our	heritage	and	 real 	 izing 	 	we	're	just	 a 	 s 	 	different	and	just	the	same	 a 	 s 	 	each	other	.
now	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	,	people	have	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	let	's	build	 bridge 	 s 	 	,	``	and	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	i	want	to	do	more	than	that	.
i	would	like	break	the	 wall 	 s 	 	of	 ignor 	 ance 	 	between	east	and	west	--	no	,	not	the	soft	option	that	we	have	 discuss 	 ed 	 	before	,	but	 ra 	 ther 	 	the	soft	power	that	joseph	nye	 ha 	 s 	 	spoken	about	before	.
culture	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	tool	to	 br 	 ing 	 	people	together	.
we	should	not	 under 	 estimate 	 	it	.
``	know	 thy 	 self 	 	,	``	that	is	the	journey	of	self	-	 express 	 ion 	 	and	self	-	 real 	 ization 	 	that	we	are	 travel 	 ing 	 	.
now	i	do	n't	pretend	to	have	all	the	 answer 	 s 	 	,	but	i	know	that	me	 a 	 s 	 	an	individual	and	we	 a 	 s 	 	a	nation	welcome	 th 	 is 	 	community	of	 idea 	 s 	 	worth	 spread 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	journey	.
i	welcome	you	on	board	for	us	to	engage	and	discuss	new	 idea 	 s 	 	of	how	to	 br 	 ing 	 	people	together	through	cultural	 initi 	 ative 	 s 	 	and	 discuss 	 ions 	 	.
 familiar 	 ity 	 	 destroy 	 s 	 	and	 trump 	 s 	 	fear	.	try	it	.
