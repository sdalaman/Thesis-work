when	i	was	a	student	here	in	oxford	in	the	1970s	,	the	future	of	the	world	was	 b 	 leak 	 	.
the	population	explosion	was	 un 	 stop 	 p 	 able 	 	.
global	famine	was	 inevit 	 able 	 	.
a	cancer	 epi 	 demic 	 	 caus 	 ed 	 	by	 chemical 	 s 	 	in	the	environment	was	going	to	 short 	 en 	 	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
the	acid	rain	was	 fall 	 ing 	 	on	the	 forest 	 s 	 	.
the	desert	was	 advanc 	 ing 	 	by	a	mile	or	two	a	year	.
the	oil	was	running	out	,
and	a	nuclear	winter	would	finish	us	off	.
 non 	 e 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	,
and	 astonish 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	if	you	look	at	what	 actual 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	my	 life 	 time 	 	,	the	average	per	-	capita	income	of	the	average	person	on	the	planet	,	in	real	 term 	 s 	 	,	 adjust 	 ed 	 	for	 infla 	 tion 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 triple 	 d 	 	.
 life 	 span 	 	is	up	by	30	percent	in	my	 life 	 time 	 	.
child	 mortal 	 ity 	 	is	down	by	two	-	 third 	 s 	 	.
per	-	capita	food	production	is	up	by	a	third	.
and	all	 th 	 is 	 	at	a	time	when	the	population	 ha 	 s 	 	 double 	 d 	 	.
how	did	we	 achiev 	 e 	 	that	,	 whet 	 her 	 	you	think	it	's	a	good	thing	or	not	?	how	did	we	 achiev 	 e 	 	that	?
how	did	we	 be 	 come 	 	the	 on 	 ly 	 	species	that	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	more	 prosper 	 ous 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	more	 popu 	 lous 	 	?
the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	blob	in	 th 	 is 	 	graph	 represent 	 s 	 	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	population	,
and	the	level	of	the	graph	 represent 	 s 	 	gdp	per	capita	.
i	think	to	answer	that	question	you	need	to	understand	how	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	 br 	 ing 	 	together	 the 	 ir 	 	 brain 	 s 	 	and	 en 	 able 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	to	combine	and	 re 	 combine 	 	,	to	meet	and	,	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	to	mate	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	you	need	to	understand	how	 idea 	 s 	 	have	 s 	 ex 	 	.
i	want	you	to	imagine	how	we	got	from	making	 object 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	to	making	 object 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
these	are	both	real	 object 	 s 	 	.
one	is	an	acheulean	hand	axe	from	half	a	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	of	the	kind	made	by	homo	 erect 	 us 	 	.
the	other	is	 obvious 	 ly 	 	a	computer	mouse	.
they	're	both	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	 s 	 ize 	 	and	shape	to	an	 un 	 can 	 ny 	 	degree	.
i	've	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	work	out	which	is	 big 	 ger 	 	,	and	it	's	 al 	 most 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	.
and	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	both	designed	to	fit	the	human	hand	.
they	're	both	 techno 	 logies 	 	.	in	the	end	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 similar 	 ity 	 	is	not	that	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
it	just	 tell 	 s 	 	you	they	 we 	 re 	 	both	designed	to	fit	the	human	hand	.
the	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	are	what	interest	me	,
 be 	 cause 	 	the	one	on	the	left	was	made	to	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	 un 	 vary 	 ing 	 	design	for	about	a	million	 year 	 s 	 	--	from	one	-	and	-	a	-	half	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	to	half	a	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
homo	 erect 	 us 	 	made	the	same	tool	for	30,000	 generation 	 s 	 	.
of	course	there	 we 	 re 	 	a	few	 change 	 s 	 	,	but	 tool 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	 s 	 lower 	 	than	 skeleton 	 s 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 day 	 s 	 	.
there	was	no	progress	,	no	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
it	's	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 phenomen 	 on 	 	,	but	it	's	true	.
 where 	 a 	 s 	 	the	object	on	the	right	is	 obsolet 	 e 	 	after	five	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 	too	,	which	is	the	object	on	the	left	is	made	from	one	 sub 	 stance 	 	.
the	object	on	the	right	is	made	from	a	confection	of	different	 sub 	 stance 	 s 	 	,	from	silicon	and	metal	and	plastic	and	so	on	.
and	more	than	that	,	it	's	a	confection	of	different	 idea 	 s 	 	,	the	idea	of	plastic	,	the	idea	of	a	laser	,	the	idea	of	 transistor 	 s 	 	.
they	've	all	 be 	 en 	 	 combine 	 d 	 	together	in	 th 	 is 	 	technology	.
and	it	's	 th 	 is 	 	combination	,	 th 	 is 	 	cumulative	technology	,	that	 intrigu 	 es 	 	me	,
 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	it	's	the	secret	to	 understand 	 ing 	 	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	the	world	.
my	body	's	an	 accumul 	 ation 	 	of	 idea 	 s 	 	too	:	the	idea	of	skin	 cell 	 s 	 	,	the	idea	of	brain	 cell 	 s 	 	,	the	idea	of	liver	 cell 	 s 	 	.
they	've	come	together	.
how	 do 	 es 	 	evolution	do	cumulative	,	 comb 	 inatorial 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	?
well	,	it	uses	sexual	 re 	 production 	 	.
in	an	 a 	 sexual 	 	species	,	if	you	get	two	different	 mutation 	 s 	 	in	different	 creature 	 s 	 	,	a	green	one	and	a	red	one	,	then	one	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	better	than	the	other	.
one	 go 	 es 	 	extinct	for	the	other	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	.
but	if	you	have	a	sexual	species	,	then	it	's	possible	for	an	individual	to	inherit	both	 mutation 	 s 	 	from	different	 line 	 age 	 s 	 	.
so	what	 s 	 ex 	 	 do 	 es 	 	is	it	 en 	 able 	 s 	 	the	individual	to	draw	 up 	 on 	 	the	genetic	 innov 	 ations 	 	of	the	whole	species	.
it	's	not	 con 	 fin 	 ed 	 	to	 it 	 s 	 	own	 line 	 age 	 	.
what	's	the	process	that	's	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	same	effect	in	cultural	evolution	 a 	 s 	 	 s 	 ex 	 	is	 hav 	 ing 	 	in	 bio 	 logical 	 	evolution	?
and	i	think	the	answer	is	 ex 	 change 	 	,	the	habit	of	 ex 	 changing 	 	one	thing	for	 an 	 other 	 	.
it	's	a	 un 	 ique 	 	human	feature	.
no	other	animal	 do 	 es 	 	it	.
you	can	teach	them	in	the	 labor 	 atory 	 	to	do	a	little	bit	of	 ex 	 change 	 	--
and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	there	's	 reciproc 	 ity 	 	in	other	 animal 	 s 	 	--
but	the	 ex 	 change 	 	of	one	object	for	 an 	 other 	 	never	 happen 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	adam	smith	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	man	ever	saw	a	dog	make	a	fair	 ex 	 change 	 	of	a	bone	with	 an 	 other 	 	dog	.	``	you	can	have	culture	 with 	 out 	 	 ex 	 change 	 	.
you	can	have	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 we 	 re 	 	,	 a 	 sexual 	 	culture	.
 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	,	killer	 whale 	 s 	 	,	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 creature 	 s 	 	,	they	have	culture	.
they	teach	each	other	 tradition 	 s 	 	which	are	 hand 	 ed 	 	down	from	parent	to	 off 	 spring 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	 teach 	 ing 	 	each	other	how	to	crack	nuts	with	 rock 	 s 	 	.
but	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	is	that	these	 culture 	 s 	 	never	expand	,	never	grow	,	never	 accumul 	 ate 	 	,	never	 be 	 come 	 	 comb 	 inatorial 	 	,	and	the	reason	is	 be 	 cause 	 	there	is	no	 s 	 ex 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 we 	 re 	 	,	there	is	no	 ex 	 change 	 	of	 idea 	 s 	 	.
chimpanzee	 troop 	 s 	 	have	different	 culture 	 s 	 	in	different	 troop 	 s 	 	.
there	's	no	 ex 	 change 	 	of	 idea 	 s 	 	between	them	.
and	why	 do 	 es 	 	 ex 	 change 	 	raise	living	 standard 	 s 	 	?
well	,	the	answer	came	from	david	ricardo	in	1817	.
and	here	is	a	stone	age	version	of	his	story	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	he	told	it	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	trade	between	 count 	 ries 	 	.
adam	 take 	 s 	 	four	 hour 	 s 	 	to	make	a	spear	and	three	 hour 	 s 	 	to	make	an	axe	.
oz	 take 	 s 	 	one	hour	to	make	a	spear	and	two	 hour 	 s 	 	to	make	an	axe	.
so	oz	is	better	at	both	 spear 	 s 	 	and	 axe 	 s 	 	than	adam	.
he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	need	adam	.
he	can	make	his	own	 spear 	 s 	 	and	 axe 	 s 	 	.
well	no	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	think	about	it	,	if	oz	 make 	 s 	 	two	 spear 	 s 	 	and	adam	make	two	 axe 	 s 	 	,	and	then	they	trade	,	then	they	will	each	have	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	an	hour	of	work	.
and	the	more	they	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	the	more	true	it	's	going	to	be	,
 be 	 cause 	 	the	more	they	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	the	better	adam	is	going	to	get	at	making	 axe 	 s 	 	and	the	better	oz	is	going	to	get	at	making	 spear 	 s 	 	.
so	the	 gain 	 s 	 	from	trade	are	 on 	 ly 	 	going	to	grow	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	 beaut 	 ies 	 	of	 ex 	 change 	 	,	is	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 create 	 s 	 	the	 moment 	 um 	 	for	more	 special 	 ization 	 	,	which	 create 	 s 	 	the	 moment 	 um 	 	for	more	 ex 	 change 	 	and	so	on	.
adam	and	oz	both	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	an	hour	of	time	.
that	is	 prosper 	 ity 	 	,	the	saving	of	time	in	 satisfy 	 ing 	 	your	 need 	 s 	 	.
ask	 your 	 self 	 	how	long	you	would	have	to	work	to	provide	for	 your 	 self 	 	an	hour	of	 read 	 ing 	 	light	 th 	 is 	 	 even 	 ing 	 	to	read	a	book	by	.
if	you	had	to	start	from	scratch	,	let	's	say	you	go	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	 country 	 side 	 	.
you	find	a	sheep	.	you	kill	it	.	you	get	the	fat	out	of	it	.
you	render	it	down	.	you	make	a	candle	,	etc	.	etc	.	how	long	is	it	going	to	take	you	?	 quit 	 e 	 	a	long	time	.
how	long	do	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	to	work	to	earn	an	hour	of	 read 	 ing 	 	light	if	you	're	on	the	average	wage	in	britain	 to 	 day 	 	?
and	the	answer	is	about	half	a	second	.
back	in	1950	,	you	would	have	had	to	work	for	eight	 second 	 s 	 	on	the	average	wage	to	 acquir 	 e 	 	that	much	light	.
and	that	's	seven	and	a	half	 second 	 s 	 	of	 prosper 	 ity 	 	that	you	've	 gain 	 ed 	 
since	1950	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 we 	 re 	 	,
 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	seven	and	a	half	 second 	 s 	 	in	which	you	can	do	 some 	 thing 	 	else	,
or	you	can	 acquir 	 e 	 	 an 	 other 	 	good	or	service	.
and	back	in	1880	,	it	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	15	 minute 	 s 	 	to	earn	that	amount	of	light	on	the	average	wage	.
back	in	1800	,	you	'd	have	had	to	work	six	 hour 	 s 	 	to	earn	a	candle	that	could	burn	for	an	hour	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	the	average	person	on	the	average	wage	could	not	afford	a	candle	in	1800	.
go	back	to	 th 	 is 	 	image	of	the	axe	and	the	mouse	,	and	ask	 your 	 self 	 	:	``	who	made	them	and	for	who	?	``
the	stone	axe	was	made	by	 some 	 one 	 	for	 him 	 self 	 	.
it	was	self	-	sufficiency	.
we	call	that	poverty	these	 day 	 s 	 	.
but	the	object	on	the	right	was	made	for	me	by	other	people	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	other	people	?
 ten 	 s 	 	?	 hundred 	 s 	 	?	 thousand 	 s 	 	?
you	know	,	i	think	it	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	 million 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	you	've	got	to	include	the	man	who	grew	the	coffee	,	which	was	 brew 	 ed 	 	for	the	man	who	was	on	the	oil	rig	,	who	was	 drill 	 ing 	 	for	oil	,	which	was	going	to	be	made	 in 	 to 	 	the	plastic	,	etc	.	they	 we 	 re 	 	all	 work 	 ing 	 	for	me	,	to	make	a	mouse	for	me	.
and	that	's	the	way	 socie 	 ty 	 	 work 	 s 	 	.
that	's	what	we	've	 achiev 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	species	.
in	the	old	 day 	 s 	 	,	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	rich	,	you	 liter 	 ally 	 	had	people	 work 	 ing 	 	for	you	.
that	's	how	you	got	to	be	rich	;	you	 employ 	 ed 	 	them	.
louis	xiv	had	a	lot	of	people	 work 	 ing 	 	for	him	.
they	made	his	 s 	 il 	 ly 	 	 out 	 fit 	 s 	 	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	,
and	they	did	his	 s 	 il 	 ly 	 	 hair 	 style 	 s 	 	,	or	 what 	 ever 	 	.
he	had	498	people	to	 prep 	 are 	 	his	 d 	 inner 	 	every	night	.
but	a	modern	tourist	going	around	the	 pa 	 lace 	 	of	versailles	and	looking	at	louis	xiv	's	 picture 	 s 	 	,	he	 ha 	 s 	 	498	people	 do 	 ing 	 	his	 d 	 inner 	 	 to 	 night 	 	too	.
they	're	in	bistros	and	 cafe 	 s 	 	and	 restaurant 	 s 	 	and	 shop 	 s 	 	all	over	paris	,
and	they	're	all	ready	to	serve	you	at	an	hour	's	notice	with	an	 excel 	 lent 	 	meal	that	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	got	 high 	 er 	 	quality	than	louis	xiv	even	had	.
and	that	's	what	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	all	 work 	 ing 	 	for	each	other	.
we	're	able	to	draw	 up 	 on 	 	 special 	 ization 	 	and	 ex 	 change 	 	to	raise	each	other	's	living	 standard 	 s 	 	.
now	,	you	do	get	other	 animal 	 s 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	for	each	other	too	.
ants	are	a	classic	 ex 	 ample 	 	;	 work 	 ers 	 	work	for	 que 	 en 	 s 	 	and	 que 	 en 	 s 	 	work	for	 work 	 ers 	 	.
but	there	's	a	big	 differ 	 ence 	 	,	which	is	that	it	 on 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	 colon 	 y 	 	.
there	's	no	 work 	 ing 	 	for	each	other	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 colon 	 ies 	 	.
and	the	reason	for	that	is	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	a	 re 	 productive 	 	division	of	labor	.
that	is	to	say	,	they	 special 	 ize 	 	with	respect	to	 re 	 production 	 	.
the	 que 	 en 	 	 do 	 es 	 	it	all	.
in	our	species	,	we	do	n't	like	 do 	 ing 	 	that	.
it	's	the	one	thing	we	insist	on	 do 	 ing 	 	for	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	is	 re 	 production 	 	.
even	in	england	,	we	do	n't	 leav 	 e 	 	 re 	 production 	 	to	the	 que 	 en 	 	.
so	when	did	 th 	 is 	 	habit	start	?
and	how	long	 ha 	 s 	 	it	 be 	 en 	 	going	on	?	and	what	 do 	 es 	 	it	mean	?
well	,	i	think	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	,	the	 old 	 est 	 	version	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	sexual	division	of	labor	.
but	i	've	got	no	evidence	for	that	.
it	just	 look 	 s 	 	like	the	first	thing	we	did	was	work	male	for	female	and	female	for	male	.
in	all	hunter	-	gatherer	 socie 	 ties 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	there	's	a	 for 	 aging 	 	division	of	labor	between	,	on	the	whole	,	 hunt 	 ing 	 	 male 	 s 	 	and	 gather 	 ing 	 	 female 	 s 	 	.
it	is	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	that	simple	,
but	there	's	a	 distinct 	 ion 	 	between	 special 	 ized 	 	 role 	 s 	 	for	 male 	 s 	 	and	 female 	 s 	 	.
and	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	system	is	that	it	 benefit 	 s 	 	both	 side 	 s 	 	.
the	woman	 know 	 s 	 	that	,	in	the	hadzas	'	case	here	--	 dig 	 ging 	 	 root 	 s 	 	to	share	with	men	in	 ex 	 change 	 	for	meat	--	she	 know 	 s 	 	that	all	she	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	to	get	access	to	protein	is	to	dig	some	extra	 root 	 s 	 	and	trade	them	for	meat	.
and	she	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	to	go	on	an	 exhaust 	 ing 	 	hunt	and	try	and	kill	a	 war 	 t 	 hog 	 	.
and	the	man	 know 	 s 	 	that	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	to	do	any	 dig 	 ging 	 	to	get	 root 	 s 	 	.
all	he	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	is	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	when	he	 kill 	 s 	 	a	 war 	 t 	 hog 	 	it	's	big	 en 	 ough 	 	to	share	some	.
and	so	both	 side 	 s 	 	raise	each	other	's	 standard 	 s 	 	of	living	through	the	sexual	division	of	labor	.
when	did	 th 	 is 	 	happen	?	we	do	n't	know	,	but	it	's	possible	that	 neanderthal 	 s 	 	did	n't	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	a	 high 	 ly 	 	 co 	 operative 	 	species	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	a	 high 	 ly 	 	intelligent	species	.
 the 	 ir 	 	 brain 	 s 	 	on	average	,	by	the	end	,	 we 	 re 	 	 big 	 ger 	 	than	 your 	 s 	 	and	mine	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	 to 	 day 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 imagin 	 ative 	 	.	they	buried	 the 	 ir 	 	dead	.
they	had	language	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	know	they	had	the	foxp	2	gene	of	the	same	kind	 a 	 s 	 	us	,	which	was	 discover 	 ed 	 	here	in	oxford	.
and	so	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	they	 prob 	 ably 	 	had	 linguist 	 ic 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 brilli 	 ant 	 	people	.	i	'm	not	 dis 	 s 	 ing 	 	the	 neanderthal 	 s 	 	.
but	there	's	no	evidence	of	a	sexual	division	of	labor	.
there	's	no	evidence	of	 gather 	 ing 	 	behavior	by	 female 	 s 	 	.
it	 look 	 s 	 	like	the	 female 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 co 	 operative 	 	 hunter 	 s 	 	with	the	men	.
and	the	other	thing	there	's	no	evidence	for	is	 ex 	 change 	 	between	 group 	 s 	 	,
 be 	 cause 	 	the	 object 	 s 	 	that	you	find	in	neanderthal	 remain 	 s 	 	,	the	 tool 	 s 	 	they	made	,	are	 al 	 ways 	 	made	from	local	 material 	 s 	 	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	in	the	caucasus	there	's	a	 s 	 ite 	 	where	you	find	local	neanderthal	 tool 	 s 	 	.
they	're	 al 	 ways 	 	made	from	local	 cher 	 t 	 	.
in	the	same	 val 	 ley 	 	there	are	modern	human	 remain 	 s 	 	from	about	the	same	date	,	30,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,
and	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	are	from	local	 cher 	 t 	 	,	but	more	--	but	 man 	 y 	 	of	them	are	made	from	 ob 	 sid 	 ian 	 	from	a	long	way	away	.
and	when	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	moving	 object 	 s 	 	around	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	it	was	evidence	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	 ex 	 changing 	 	between	 group 	 s 	 	.
trade	is	10	 time 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	old	 a 	 s 	 	 farm 	 ing 	 	.
people	forget	that	.	people	think	of	trade	 a 	 s 	 	a	modern	thing	.
 ex 	 change 	 	between	 group 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	going	on	for	a	hundred	thousand	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	the	 ear 	 liest 	 	evidence	for	it	 crop 	 s 	 	up	 some 	 where 	 	between	80	and	120,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	in	africa	,	when	you	see	 ob 	 sid 	 ian 	 	and	 ja 	 s 	 per 	 	and	other	 thing 	 s 	 	moving	long	 distance 	 s 	 	in	ethiopia	.
you	 al 	 so 	 	see	 sea 	 shell 	 s 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	by	a	team	here	in	oxford	--	moving	125	 mile 	 s 	 	 in 	 land 	 	from	the	mediterranean	in	algeria	.
and	that	's	evidence	that	people	have	 start 	 ed 	 	 ex 	 changing 	 	between	 group 	 s 	 	.
and	that	will	have	led	to	 special 	 ization 	 	.
how	do	you	know	that	long	-	distance	 move 	 ment 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	trade	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 migr 	 ation 	 	?
well	,	you	look	at	modern	hunter	 gatherer 	 s 	 	like	 ab 	 original 	 s 	 	,	who	 quar 	 ri 	 ed 	 	for	stone	 axe 	 s 	 	at	a	place	 call 	 ed 	 	mount	isa	,	which	was	a	 quar 	 ry 	 	owned	by	the	kalkadoon	tribe	.
they	 trade 	 d 	 	them	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 neighbor 	 s 	 	for	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 s 	 ting 	 ray 	 	 barb 	 s 	 	,
and	the	 con 	 sequence 	 	was	that	stone	 axe 	 s 	 	 end 	 ed 	 	up	over	a	large	part	of	australia	.
so	long	-	distance	 move 	 ment 	 	of	 tool 	 s 	 	is	a	sign	of	trade	,	not	 migr 	 ation 	 	.
what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	you	cut	people	off	from	 ex 	 change 	 	,	from	the	ability	to	 ex 	 change 	 	and	 special 	 ize 	 	?
and	the	answer	is	that	not	 on 	 ly 	 	do	you	 s 	 low 	 	down	 techno 	 logical 	 	progress	,	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	throw	it	 in 	 to 	 	reverse	.
an	 ex 	 ample 	 	is	tasmania	.
when	the	sea	level	rose	and	tasmania	 be 	 came 	 	an	 is 	 land 	 	10,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	the	people	on	it	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 experience 	 d 	 	 s 	 lower 	 	progress	than	people	on	the	 main 	 land 	 	,	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	 experience 	 d 	 	regress	.
they	 g 	 ave 	 	up	the	ability	to	make	stone	 tool 	 s 	 	and	 fish 	 ing 	 	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	and	 cloth 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	population	of	about	4,000	people	was	 simpl 	 y 	 	not	large	 en 	 ough 	 	to	maintain	the	 special 	 ized 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	 necess 	 ary 	 	to	keep	the	technology	they	had	.
it	's	 a 	 s 	 	if	the	people	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	 we 	 re 	 	 plonk 	 ed 	 	on	a	desert	 is 	 land 	 	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	in	our	 pocket 	 s 	 	could	we	 continu 	 e 	 	to	make	after	10,000	 year 	 s 	 	?
it	did	n't	happen	in	tierra	del	fuego	--	similar	 is 	 land 	 	,	similar	people	.
the	reason	:	 be 	 cause 	 	tierra	del	fuego	is	 separat 	 ed 	 	from	south	america	by	a	much	 narrow 	 er 	 	straight	,
and	there	was	 tra 	 d 	 ing 	 	contact	 a 	 cross 	 	that	straight	 through 	 out 	 	10,000	 year 	 s 	 	.
the	tasmanians	 we 	 re 	 	 isolate 	 d 	 	.
go	back	to	 th 	 is 	 	image	 aga 	 in 	 	and	ask	 your 	 self 	 	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	who	made	it	and	for	who	,	but	who	 k 	 new 	 	how	to	make	it	.
in	the	case	of	the	stone	axe	,	the	man	who	made	it	 k 	 new 	 	how	to	make	it	.
but	who	 know 	 s 	 	how	to	make	a	computer	mouse	?
 no 	 body 	 	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	 no 	 body 	 	.
there	is	 no 	 body 	 	on	the	planet	who	 know 	 s 	 	how	to	make	a	computer	mouse	.
i	mean	 th 	 is 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 serious 	 ly 	 	.
the	 p 	 resident 	 	of	the	computer	mouse	company	 do 	 es 	 	n't	know	.
he	just	 know 	 s 	 	how	to	run	a	company	.
the	person	on	the	 assem 	 bly 	 	line	 do 	 es 	 	n't	know	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	know	how	to	drill	an	oil	well	to	get	oil	out	to	make	plastic	,	and	so	on	.
we	all	know	little	bits	,	but	 non 	 e 	 	of	us	 know 	 s 	 	the	whole	.
i	am	of	course	 quo 	 ting 	 	from	a	famous	essay	by	leonard	read	,	the	economist	in	the	1950s	,	 call 	 ed 	 	``	i	,	pencil	``	in	which	he	wrote	about	how	a	pencil	came	to	be	made	,	and	how	 no 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	even	how	to	make	a	pencil	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	people	who	assemble	it	do	n't	know	how	to	mine	 graph 	 ite 	 	,
and	they	do	n't	know	how	to	fell	 tree 	 s 	 	and	that	kind	of	thing	.
and	what	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	in	human	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	through	 ex 	 change 	 	and	 special 	 ization 	 	,	is	we	've	 create 	 d 	 	the	ability	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	do	n't	even	understand	.
it	's	not	the	same	with	language	.
with	language	we	have	to	transfer	 idea 	 s 	 	that	we	understand	with	each	other	.
but	with	technology	,	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	beyond	our	 cap 	 abilities 	 	.
we	've	gone	beyond	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	of	the	human	mind	to	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	degree	.
and	by	the	way	,	that	's	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	that	i	'm	not	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	debate	about	i.q	.	,	about	 whet 	 her 	 	some	 group 	 s 	 	have	 high 	 er 	 	i.	q.	s	than	other	 group 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 complete 	 ly 	 	 ir 	 relevant 	 	.
what	's	relevant	to	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	is	how	well	people	are	 commun 	 ic 	 ating 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	,	and	how	well	they	're	 co 	 oper 	 ating 	 	,	not	how	clever	the	 individual 	 s 	 	are	.
so	we	've	 create 	 d 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 collect 	 ive 	 	brain	.
we	're	just	the	 nod 	 es 	 	in	the	network	.
we	're	the	 neuro 	 ns 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	brain	.
it	's	the	 inter 	 change 	 	of	 idea 	 s 	 	,	the	 meet 	 ing 	 	and	 mat 	 ing 	 	of	 idea 	 s 	 	between	them	,	that	is	 caus 	 ing 	 	 techno 	 logical 	 	progress	,	 increment 	 ally 	 	,	bit	by	bit	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	bad	 thing 	 s 	 	happen	.
and	in	the	future	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	go	forward	,	we	will	,	of	course	,	experience	 terr 	 ible 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
there	will	be	 war 	 s 	 	;	there	will	be	 depress 	 ions 	 	;	there	will	be	natural	 disaster 	 s 	 	.
awful	 thing 	 s 	 	will	happen	in	 th 	 is 	 	century	,	i	'm	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	.
but	i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 connect 	 ions 	 	people	are	making	,	and	the	ability	of	 idea 	 s 	 	to	meet	and	to	mate	 a 	 s 	 	never	before	,
i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	that	technology	will	advance	,	and	 there 	 fore 	 	living	 standard 	 s 	 	will	advance	.
 be 	 cause 	 	through	the	cloud	,	through	crowd	sourcing	,	through	the	bottom	-	up	world	that	we	've	 create 	 d 	 	,	where	not	just	the	 elite 	 s 	 	but	 every 	 body 	 	is	able	to	have	 the 	 ir 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	and	make	them	meet	and	mate	,	we	are	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	 accele 	 rating 	 	the	rate	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
thank	you	.
