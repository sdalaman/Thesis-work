you	'll	be	happy	to	know	that	i	'll	be	 talk 	 ing 	 	not	about	my	own	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	,	but	other	people	's	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	.
it	's	a	lot	 eas 	 ier 	 	to	be	 light 	 hearted 	 	about	other	people	's	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	than	your	own	,	and	i	want	to	keep	it	in	the	spirit	of	the	 con 	 ference 	 	.
so	,	if	you	 believ 	 e 	 	the	media	 account 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 ing 	 	a	drug	 deal 	 er 	 	in	the	height	of	the	crack	 coca 	 ine 	 	 epi 	 demic 	 	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 glamor 	 ous 	 	life	,	in	the	 word 	 s 	 	of	virginia	postrel	.
there	was	money	,	there	was	 drug 	 s 	 	,	 gun 	 s 	 	,	women	,	you	know	,	you	name	it	--	 jewel 	 ry 	 	,	bling	-	bling	--	it	had	it	all	.
what	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	 to 	 day 	 	is	that	,	in	fact	,	based	on	10	 year 	 s 	 	of	research	,	a	 un 	 ique 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	go	 in 	 side 	 	a	gang	--	to	see	the	actual	 book 	 s 	 	,	the	financial	 record 	 s 	 	of	the	gang	--	that	the	answer	 turn 	 s 	 	out	not	to	be	that	 be 	 ing 	 	in	the	gang	was	a	 glamor 	 ous 	 	life	.
but	i	think	,	more	 realistic 	 ally 	 	,	that	 be 	 ing 	 	in	a	gang	--	selling	 drug 	 s 	 	for	a	gang	--	is	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	the	worst	job	in	all	of	america	.
and	that	's	what	i	'd	like	to	 con 	 vince 	 	you	of	 to 	 day 	 	.
so	there	are	three	 thing 	 s 	 	i	want	to	do	.
first	,	i	want	to	explain	how	and	why	crack	 coca 	 ine 	 	had	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 pro 	 found 	 	influence	on	inner	-	city	 gang 	 s 	 	.
 second 	 ly 	 	,	i	want	to	tell	you	how	 some 	 body 	 	like	me	came	to	be	able	to	see	the	inner	 work 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	a	gang	.
it	's	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	story	,	i	think	.
and	then	third	,	i	want	to	tell	you	,	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 super 	 ficial 	 	way	,	about	some	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	found	when	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	got	to	look	at	the	financial	 record 	 s 	 	--	the	 book 	 s 	 	--	of	the	gang	.
so	before	i	do	that	,	just	one	 war 	 ning 	 	,	which	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	 present 	 ation 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	rated	'	r	'	by	the	motion	picture	 associ 	 ation 	 	of	america	.
it	 contain 	 s 	 	adult	 theme 	 s 	 	,	adult	language	.
 give 	 n 	 	who	is	up	on	the	stage	,	you	'll	be	 de 	 light 	 ed 	 	to	know	that	in	fact	there	'll	be	no	 nud 	 ity 	 	,	 bar 	 ring 	 	a	--
--	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	 ward 	 robe 	 	 mal 	 function 	 s 	 	 a 	 side 	 	.
so	let	me	start	by	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	crack	 coca 	 ine 	 	,	and	how	it	 transform 	 ed 	 	the	gang	.
and	to	do	that	,	you	have	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	go	back	to	a	time	before	crack	 coca 	 ine 	 	,	in	the	early	'80s	,	and	look	at	it	from	the	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	of	a	gang	 lead 	 er 	 	.
so	 be 	 ing 	 	a	gang	 lead 	 er 	 	in	the	inner	city	was	n't	 s 	 uch 	 	a	bad	deal	in	the	mid	-	'80s	.
in	the	early	'80s	,	some	would	say	.
now	,	you	had	a	lot	of	power	,	and	you	got	to	beat	people	up	--	you	got	a	lot	of	 pre 	 stig 	 e 	 	,	a	lot	of	respect	.
but	there	was	no	money	in	it	,	ok	?
the	gang	had	no	way	to	make	money	.
and	you	could	n't	charge	 due 	 s 	 	to	the	people	in	the	gang	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	people	in	the	gang	did	n't	have	any	money	.
you	could	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	make	any	money	selling	 mar 	 ijuana 	 	.
 mar 	 ijuana 	 	's	too	cheap	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	.
you	ca	n't	get	rich	selling	 mar 	 ijuana 	 	.
you	could	n't	sell	 coca 	 ine 	 	.
you	know	,	 coca 	 ine 	 	's	a	great	product	--	 powder 	 ed 	 	 coca 	 ine 	 	--	but	you	've	got	to	know	rich	white	people	.
and	most	of	the	inner	-	city	gang	 member 	 s 	 	did	n't	know	any	rich	white	people	--	they	could	n't	sell	to	that	market	.
you	could	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	do	 pet 	 ty 	 	crime	,	either	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	 pet 	 ty 	 	crime	's	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	way	to	make	a	living	.
so	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	gang	 lead 	 er 	 	,	you	had	,	you	know	,	power	--
it	's	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	life	--
but	the	thing	was	,	in	the	end	,	you	 we 	 re 	 	living	at	home	with	your	mother	.
and	so	it	was	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	a	 care 	 er 	 	.
it	was	 some 	 thing 	 	that	--
it	's	just	there	 we 	 re 	 	 limit 	 s 	 	to	how	 power 	 ful 	 	and	 import 	 ant 	 	you	could	be	if	you	had	to	live	at	home	with	your	mother	.
then	 a 	 long 	 	 come 	 s 	 	crack	 coca 	 ine 	 	.
and	in	the	 word 	 s 	 	of	malcolm	gladwell	,	crack	 coca 	 ine 	 	was	the	extra	-	 chunk 	 y 	 	version	of	tomato	sauce	for	the	inner	city	.
 be 	 cause 	 	crack	 coca 	 ine 	 	was	an	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
i	do	n't	have	time	to	talk	about	it	 to 	 day 	 	.
but	if	you	think	about	it	,	i	would	say	that	in	the	last	twenty	-	five	 year 	 s 	 	,	of	every	 invent 	 ion 	 	or	 innov 	 ation 	 	that	's	 occur 	 red 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	,	the	 big 	 gest 	 	one	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	impact	on	the	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	of	people	who	live	in	the	inner	city	,	was	crack	 coca 	 ine 	 	.
and	for	the	 wo 	 rse 	 	--	not	for	the	better	,	but	for	the	 wo 	 rse 	 	.
it	had	a	huge	impact	on	life	.
so	what	was	it	about	crack	 coca 	 ine 	 	?
it	was	a	 brilli 	 ant 	 	way	of	 get 	 ting 	 	the	brain	high	.
 be 	 cause 	 	you	could	smoke	crack	 coca 	 ine 	 	--	you	ca	n't	smoke	 powder 	 ed 	 	 coca 	 ine 	 	--	and	 smok 	 ing 	 	is	a	much	more	efficient	 mechan 	 ism 	 	at	 deliver 	 ing 	 	a	high	than	is	 s 	 nor 	 ting 	 	it	.
and	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	,	there	was	 th 	 is 	 	audience	that	did	n't	know	it	 want 	 ed 	 	crack	 coca 	 ine 	 	,	but	,	when	it	came	,	it	 re 	 ally 	 	did	.
and	it	was	a	perfect	drug	.	you	could	sell	for	--
buy	the	 coca 	 ine 	 	that	went	 in 	 to 	 	it	for	a	dollar	,	sell	it	for	five	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
 high 	 ly 	 	 addict 	 ive 	 	--	the	high	was	 ver 	 y 	 	short	.
so	for	fifteen	 minute 	 s 	 	,	you	get	 th 	 is 	 	great	high	.
and	then	,	when	you	come	down	,	all	you	want	to	do	is	get	high	 aga 	 in 	 	.
it	 create 	 d 	 	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	market	.
and	for	the	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	there	running	the	gang	,	it	was	a	great	way	,	 seem 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	to	make	a	lot	of	money	.
at	 l 	 east 	 	for	the	people	in	the	top	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	we	enter	the	picture	.
not	 re 	 ally 	 	me	--	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	a	bit	player	in	all	 th 	 is 	 	.
my	co	-	author	,	sudhir	venkatesh	,	is	the	main	character	.
so	he	was	a	math	major	in	college	who	had	a	good	heart	,	and	 decide 	 d 	 	he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	get	a	 socio 	 logy 	 	ph.d.	,
came	to	the	university	of	chicago	.
now	,	the	three	 month 	 s 	 	before	he	came	to	chicago	,	he	had	 s 	 pent 	 	 follow 	 ing 	 	the	 grat 	 e 	 ful 	 	dead	.
and	,	in	his	own	 word 	 s 	 	,	he	``	 look 	 ed 	 	like	a	freak	.	``
he	's	a	south	asian	--	 ver 	 y 	 	dark	-	 skin 	 ned 	 	south	asian	.
big	man	,	and	he	had	hair	,	in	his	 word 	 s 	 	,	``	down	to	his	ass	.	``
 defi 	 ed 	 	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 bound 	 aries 	 	:	was	he	black	or	white	?	was	he	man	or	woman	?
he	was	 re 	 ally 	 	a	 cur 	 ious 	 	sight	to	be	 s 	 een 	 	.
so	he	 show 	 ed 	 	up	at	the	university	of	chicago	.
and	the	famous	 socio 	 logist 	 	,	william	julius	wilson	,	was	 do 	 ing 	 	a	book	that	 involve 	 d 	 	 survey 	 ing 	 	people	all	 a 	 cross 	 	chicago	.
and	he	took	one	look	at	sudhir	,	who	was	going	to	go	do	some	 survey 	 s 	 	for	him	,	and	 decide 	 d 	 	he	 k 	 new 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	place	to	 s 	 end 	 	him	--	which	was	to	one	of	the	 tough 	 est 	 	,	most	notorious	housing	 project 	 s 	 	.
and	not	just	in	chicago	,	but	in	the	entire	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
so	sudhir	--	the	 sub 	 urban 	 	boy	who	had	never	 re 	 ally 	 	 be 	 en 	 	in	the	inner	city	--	 dutiful 	 ly 	 	took	his	 clip 	 board 	 	and	,	you	know	,	 walk 	 ed 	 	down	to	 th 	 is 	 	housing	project	.
 get 	 s 	 	to	the	first	building	.
the	first	building	?	well	,	there	's	 no 	 body 	 	there	.
but	he	 hear 	 s 	 	some	 voice 	 s 	 	up	in	the	 stair 	 well 	 	,	so	he	 climb 	 s 	 	up	the	 stair 	 well 	 	.
and	he	 come 	 s 	 	around	the	corner	--	 find 	 s 	 	a	group	of	young	african	-	american	men	 play 	 ing 	 	 d 	 ice 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	about	1990	--	peak	of	the	crack	 epi 	 demic 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	job	,	 be 	 ing 	 	in	a	gang	--	you	do	n't	like	to	be	 surprise 	 d 	 	.
you	do	n't	like	to	be	 surprise 	 d 	 	by	people	who	come	around	the	corner	.
and	the	 man 	 tra 	 	was	:	shoot	first	;	ask	 question 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
now	,	sudhir	was	 luck 	 y 	 	.
he	was	 s 	 uch 	 	a	freak	--	and	that	 clip 	 board 	 	 prob 	 ably 	 	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	his	life	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 figur 	 ed 	 	no	other	rival	gang	member	would	be	coming	up	to	shoot	at	them	with	a	 clip 	 board 	 	.
so	his	 greet 	 ing 	 	was	not	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	warm	,	but	they	did	say	,	well	,	ok	--	let	's	hear	your	 question 	 s 	 	on	your	survey	.
so	,	i	kid	you	not	,	the	first	question	on	the	survey	that	he	was	 s 	 ent 	 	to	ask	was	,	``	how	do	you	feel	about	 be 	 ing 	 	poor	and	black	in	america	?	``	 make 	 s 	 	you	wonder	about	 academic 	 s 	 	,	ok	?
so	the	choice	of	 answer 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	:	 ver 	 y 	 	good	,	good	,	bad	and	 ver 	 y 	 	bad	.
what	sudhir	found	out	is	,	in	fact	,	that	the	real	answer	was	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	--	the	survey	was	not	,	in	the	end	,	going	to	be	what	got	sudhir	off	the	hook	.
he	was	held	 host 	 age 	 	 over 	 night 	 	in	the	 stair 	 well 	 	.
there	was	a	lot	of	 gun 	 fire 	 	;	there	 we 	 re 	 	a	lot	of	 philosoph 	 ical 	 	 discuss 	 ions 	 	he	had	with	the	gang	 member 	 s 	 	.
by	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	the	gang	 lead 	 er 	 	 arriv 	 ed 	 	,
 check 	 ed 	 	out	sudhir	,	 decide 	 d 	 	he	was	no	threat	and	they	let	him	go	home	.
so	sudhir	went	home	.	took	a	shower	,	took	a	nap	.
and	you	and	i	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	,	 face 	 d 	 	with	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	would	think	,	well	,	i	guess	i	'm	going	to	write	my	 dissert 	 ation 	 	on	the	 grat 	 e 	 ful 	 	dead	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 follow 	 ing 	 	them	for	the	last	three	 month 	 s 	 	.
sudhir	,	on	the	other	hand	,	got	right	back	--	 walk 	 ed 	 	down	to	the	housing	project	.
went	up	to	the	floor	,	the	second	floor	,	and	 s 	 aid 	 	:	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	 guy 	 s 	 	.
i	had	so	much	 f 	 un 	 	 hang 	 ing 	 	out	with	you	last	night	,
i	wonder	if	i	could	do	it	 aga 	 in 	 	 to 	 night 	 	.	``	and	that	was	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	what	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	relationship	that	 involve 	 d 	 	sudhir	living	in	the	housing	project	on	and	off	for	10	 year 	 s 	 	:	 hang 	 ing 	 	out	in	crack	 house 	 s 	 	,	going	to	jail	with	the	gang	 member 	 s 	 	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	car	-	 window 	 s 	 	shot	out	of	his	car	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	police	break	 in 	 to 	 	his	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	and	steal	his	computer	 dis 	 k 	 s 	 	--
you	name	it	.
but	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	the	story	 ha 	 s 	 	a	happy	 end 	 ing 	 	for	sudhir	,	who	 be 	 came 	 	one	of	the	most	 respect 	 ed 	 	 socio 	 logists 	 	in	the	country	.
and	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	for	me	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 at 	 	in	my	 off 	 ice 	 	with	my	excel	 spread 	 sheet 	 	open	,	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	sudhir	to	come	and	deliver	to	me	the	 lat 	 est 	 	load	of	data	that	he	would	get	from	the	gang	.
it	was	one	of	the	most	 un 	 equal 	 	co	-	 author 	 ing 	 	 relationship 	 s 	 	ever	--
--	but	i	was	glad	to	be	the	 benefici 	 ary 	 	of	it	.
so	what	do	we	find	?	what	do	we	find	in	the	gang	?	well	,	let	me	say	one	thing	.	we	 re 	 ally 	 	got	access	to	 every 	 body 	 	in	the	gang	.
we	got	an	 in 	 side 	 	look	at	the	gang	,	from	the	 ver 	 y 	 	bottom	up	to	the	 ver 	 y 	 	top	.
they	 trust 	 ed 	 	sudhir	--	in	ways	that	 re 	 ally 	 	no	academic	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	--	or	 re 	 ally 	 	 any 	 body 	 	,	any	 out 	 sider 	 	--	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	 earn 	 ed 	 	the	trust	of	these	 gang 	 s 	 	,
to	the	point	where	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	 open 	 ed 	 	up	what	was	most	 interest 	 ing 	 	for	me	:	 the 	 ir 	 	 book 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	financial	 record 	 s 	 	that	they	 ke 	 pt 	 	.
and	they	made	them	 avail 	 able 	 	to	us	.
and	we	not	 on 	 ly 	 	could	 stud 	 y 	 	them	,	but	we	could	ask	them	 question 	 s 	 	about	what	was	in	them	.
so	if	i	have	to	kind	of	summarize	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	in	the	short	time	i	have	what	the	sort	of	bottom	line	of	what	i	take	away	from	the	gang	is	,	is	that	if	i	had	to	draw	a	parallel	between	the	gang	and	any	other	 organ 	 ization 	 	,	it	would	be	that	the	gang	is	just	like	mcdonald	's	.
in	a	lot	of	different	 respect 	 s 	 	--	the	restaurant	mcdonald	's	.	so	first	,	in	one	way	--	which	is	n't	 may 	 be 	 	the	most	 interest 	 ing 	 	way	,	but	it	's	a	good	way	to	start	--	is	in	the	way	it	's	 organize 	 d 	 	--
the	 hierarch 	 y 	 	of	the	gang	,	the	way	it	 look 	 s 	 	.
so	here	's	what	the	org	chart	of	the	gang	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
i	do	n't	know	if	any	of	you	know	 ver 	 y 	 	much	about	org	 chart 	 s 	 	,	but	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	to	assign	a	 strip 	 ped 	 	-	down	and	 simpl 	 ified 	 	mcdonald	's	org	chart	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	the	org	chart	would	look	like	.
now	,	it	's	 amaz 	 ing 	 	,	but	the	top	level	of	the	gang	,	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	call	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	the	``	board	of	 director 	 s 	 	.	``
and	sudhir	 say 	 s 	 	it	's	not	like	these	 guy 	 s 	 	had	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	kind	of	view	of	like	,	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	american	corporate	life	.
but	they	had	 s 	 een 	 	 movie 	 s 	 	like	``	wall	street	,	``	and	they	kind	of	had	 learn 	 ed 	 	a	little	bit	about	what	it	was	like	to	be	in	the	real	world	.
now	,	 be 	 low 	 	that	board	of	 director 	 s 	 	,	you	've	got	 essential 	 ly 	 	what	are	 region 	 al 	 	vps	--	people	who	control	,	say	,	the	south	side	of	chicago	,	or	the	west	side	of	chicago	.
now	,	sudhir	got	to	know	 ver 	 y 	 	well	the	guy	who	had	the	 un 	 fortunate 	 	 assign 	 ment 	 	of	 try 	 ing 	 	to	take	the	iowa	franchise	.
which	,	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	,	for	 th 	 is 	 	black	gang	,	was	not	one	of	the	more	 brilli 	 ant 	 	financial	 endeavor 	 s 	 	that	they	 under 	 took 	 	.
but	the	thing	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 make 	 s 	 	the	gang	seem	like	mcdonald	's	is	 it 	 s 	 	 franchise 	 es 	 	.
that	the	 guy 	 s 	 	who	are	running	,	you	know	,	the	local	 gang 	 s 	 	--	they	're	just	like	the	 guy 	 s 	 	,	in	some	sense	,	who	are	running	the	mcdonald	's	.
they	are	the	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	.
they	get	the	exclusive	 proper 	 ty 	 	 right 	 s 	 	to	control	the	drug	-	selling	.
they	get	the	name	of	the	gang	 be 	 hind 	 	them	,	for	 merchan 	 dis 	 ing 	 	and	 market 	 ing 	 	.
and	they	're	the	 one 	 s 	 	who	 bas 	 ically 	 	make	the	profit	or	lose	a	profit	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	how	good	they	are	at	running	the	business	.
now	,	the	group	i	 re 	 ally 	 	want	you	to	think	about	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	are	the	 one 	 s 	 	at	the	bottom	,	the	foot	 soldier 	 s 	 	.
these	are	the	 teenager 	 s 	 	,	 typical 	 ly 	 	,	who	'd	be	 stand 	 ing 	 	out	on	the	street	corner	,	selling	the	 drug 	 s 	 	.
 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	work	.
and	 import 	 ant 	 	to	note	that	 al 	 most 	 	all	of	the	weight	,	all	of	the	people	in	 th 	 is 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	are	at	the	bottom	.
ok	,	just	like	mcdonald	's	.
so	in	some	sense	,	the	foot	 soldier 	 s 	 	are	a	lot	like	the	people	who	are	taking	your	order	at	mcdonald	's	.
and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	it	's	not	just	by	chance	that	they	're	like	them	.
in	fact	,	in	these	 neighbor 	 hood 	 s 	 	,	they	'd	be	the	same	people	.
so	the	same	 kid 	 s 	 	who	are	 work 	 ing 	 	in	the	gang	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	same	time	,	they	would	 typical 	 ly 	 	be	 work 	 ing 	 	part	-	time	at	a	place	like	mcdonald	's	.
which	 al 	 ready 	 	,	i	think	,	 fore 	 shadow 	 s 	 	the	main	result	that	i	've	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	,	about	what	a	 crap 	 py 	 	job	it	was	 be 	 ing 	 	in	the	gang	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	if	 be 	 ing 	 	in	the	gang	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	,	 luc 	 rative 	 	job	,	why	in	the	world	would	these	 guy 	 s 	 	 moon 	 light 	 	at	mcdonald	's	?
so	what	do	the	 wage 	 s 	 	look	like	?	so	you	might	be	 surprise 	 d 	 	.
but	based	on	the	actual	--	you	know	,	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	talk	to	them	,	and	to	see	 the 	 ir 	 	 record 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	 wage 	 s 	 	.
the	 hour 	 ly 	 	wage	the	foot	 soldier 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 earn 	 ing 	 	was	$	3.50	in	an	hour	.
it	was	 be 	 low 	 	the	 minim 	 um 	 	wage	,	ok	?	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	well	 document 	 ed 	 	.
it	's	easy	to	see	,	by	the	 pattern 	 s 	 	of	consumption	they	have	.
it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	not	fiction	--	it	's	fact	.
there	was	 ver 	 y 	 	little	money	in	the	gang	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	at	the	bottom	.
now	if	you	 manage 	 d 	 	to	rise	up	--	say	,	and	be	that	local	 lead 	 er 	 	,	the	guy	who	's	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	the	mcdonald	's	 franchise 	 e 	 	--	you	'd	be	making	100,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	.
and	that	,	in	some	ways	,	was	the	best	job	you	could	hope	to	get	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	growing	up	in	one	of	these	 neighbor 	 hood 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	young	black	male	.
if	you	 manage 	 d 	 	to	rise	to	the	 ver 	 y 	 	top	,	200,000	or	400,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	is	what	you	'd	hope	to	make	.
 tru 	 ly 	 	,	you	would	be	a	great	success	story	.
and	one	of	the	 s 	 ad 	 	 part 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	among	the	 man 	 y 	 	other	 ram 	 ification 	 s 	 	of	crack	 coca 	 ine 	 	is	that	the	most	 talent 	 ed 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	in	these	 commun 	 ities 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	they	 we 	 re 	 	 striv 	 ing 	 	for	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	it	in	legitimate	ways	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	 we 	 re 	 	no	legitimate	 channel 	 s 	 	out	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	the	best	way	out	.
and	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	was	the	right	choice	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	,	to	try	to	make	it	out	--	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
you	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	--
the	relationship	to	mcdonald	's	 break 	 s 	 	down	here	.
the	money	 look 	 s 	 	about	the	same	.
why	is	it	 s 	 uch 	 	a	bad	job	?
well	,	the	reason	it	's	 s 	 uch 	 	a	bad	job	is	that	there	's	 some 	 body 	 	 shoot 	 ing 	 	at	you	a	lot	of	the	time	.
so	,	with	 shoot 	 ing 	 	at	you	,	what	are	the	death	rates	?
we	found	in	our	gang	--	and	,	 admitted 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	not	 re 	 ally 	 	sort	of	a	standard	 situ 	 ation 	 	;
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	time	of	 intens 	 e 	 	violence	--	of	a	lot	of	gang	 war 	 s 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	gang	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 came 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	.	but	there	 we 	 re 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	.
and	so	the	death	rate	--	not	to	 ment 	 ion 	 	the	rate	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 arrest 	 ed 	 	,	 s 	 ent 	 	to	 pri 	 son 	 	,	 be 	 ing 	 	 wound 	 ed 	 	--	the	death	rate	in	our	 s 	 ample 	 	was	seven	percent	per	person	per	year	.
you	're	in	the	gang	for	four	 year 	 s 	 	;	you	expect	to	die	with	about	a	25	percent	 like 	 li 	 hood 	 	.
so	for	 compar 	 ison 	 	's	 purpose 	 s 	 	,	let	's	think	about	some	other	walk	of	life	where	you	may	expect	might	be	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 risk 	 y 	 	.
like	let	's	say	that	you	 we 	 re 	 	a	 murder 	 er 	 	and	you	 we 	 re 	 	 convict 	 ed 	 	of	murder	,	and	you	're	 s 	 ent 	 	to	death	row	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	the	death	rates	on	death	row	--	from	all	 cause 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 exec 	 ution 	 	--	two	percent	a	year	.
so	it	's	a	lot	 safe 	 r 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	on	death	row	than	it	is	selling	 drug 	 s 	 	out	on	the	street	.
that	 make 	 s 	 	you	pause	--	 give 	 s 	 	you	some	pause	--	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	 believ 	 e 	 	that	a	death	 penal 	 ty 	 	's	going	to	have	an	enormous	 de 	 ter 	 rent 	 	effect	on	crime	.
now	to	give	you	a	sense	of	just	how	bad	the	inner	city	was	 dur 	 ing 	 	crack	--	and	i	'm	not	 re 	 ally 	 	 focus 	 ing 	 	on	the	 negative 	 s 	 	,	but	 re 	 ally 	 	,	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	story	to	tell	you	there	--	if	you	look	at	the	death	rates	--	just	of	random	,	young	black	 male 	 s 	 	growing	up	in	the	inner	city	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	--	the	death	rates	 dur 	 ing 	 	crack	 we 	 re 	 	about	one	percent	.
that	's	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	high	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	violent	death	--	it	's	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	,	in	some	sense	.
to	put	it	 in 	 to 	 	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	if	you	 compar 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	to	the	 soldier 	 s 	 	in	 ir 	 aq 	 	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	right	now	 fight 	 ing 	 	the	war	:	0.5	percent	.
so	in	some	 ver 	 y 	 	 liter 	 al 	 	way	,	the	young	black	men	who	 we 	 re 	 	growing	up	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	 we 	 re 	 	living	in	a	war	zone	,	 ver 	 y 	 	much	in	the	sense	of	the	way	that	the	 soldier 	 s 	 	over	in	 ir 	 aq 	 	are	 fight 	 ing 	 	in	a	war	.
so	why	in	the	world	,	you	might	ask	,	would	 any 	 body 	 	be	 will 	 ing 	 	to	stand	out	on	a	street	corner	selling	 drug 	 s 	 	for	$	3.50	an	hour	,	with	a	25	percent	chance	of	 dy 	 ing 	 	over	the	next	four	 year 	 s 	 	?
why	would	they	do	that	?	and	i	think	there	are	a	couple	 answer 	 s 	 	.
i	think	the	first	one	is	that	they	got	 fool 	 ed 	 	by	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
it	used	to	be	the	gang	was	a	rite	of	 pass 	 age 	 	.
that	the	young	people	controlled	the	gang	--	that	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	got	 old 	 er 	 	,	you	 drop 	 ped 	 	out	of	the	gang	.
so	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	was	,	the	people	who	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	be	in	the	right	place	at	the	right	time	--	the	people	who	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	be	 lead 	 ing 	 	the	gang	in	the	mid	-	to	late	'80s	--	 be 	 came 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 wealth 	 y 	 	.
and	so	the	logical	thing	to	think	was	that	:	``	well	,	the	next	generation	--	so	they	're	going	to	age	out	of	the	gang	,	like	 every 	 body 	 	else	 ha 	 s 	 	,	and	the	next	generation	is	going	to	take	over	and	get	the	wealth	.	``
so	there	are	 s 	 tri 	 king 	 	 similar 	 ities 	 	,	i	think	,	to	the	 inter 	 net 	 	boom	,	right	?
the	first	set	of	people	in	silicon	 val 	 ley 	 	got	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	rich	.
and	then	all	of	my	 friend 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	:	``	 may 	 be 	 	i	should	go	do	that	,	too	.	``	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 will 	 ing 	 	to	work	 ver 	 y 	 	cheap	,	for	stock	 option 	 s 	 	that	never	came	.
in	some	sense	,	that	's	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	 exact 	 ly 	 	,	to	the	set	of	people	we	 we 	 re 	 	looking	at	,	is	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	 will 	 ing 	 	to	start	at	the	bottom	.
just	like	,	say	,	a	lawyer	at	a	law	firm	--	a	first	-	year	lawyer	is	 wi 	 ling 	 	to	start	at	the	bottom	,	work	80	-	hour	 week 	 s 	 	for	not	that	much	money	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	think	they	're	going	to	make	partner	.
but	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	was	,	the	 rule 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	,	and	they	never	got	to	make	partner	.
 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	the	same	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	running	all	of	the	major	 gang 	 s 	 	in	the	late	1980s	are	still	running	the	major	 gang 	 s 	 	in	chicago	 to 	 day 	 	.
they	never	 pass 	 ed 	 	on	any	of	the	wealth	.
so	 every 	 body 	 	got	 s 	 tuck 	 	at	that	$	3.50	-	an	-	hour	job	,	and	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	a	disaster	.
the	other	thing	the	gang	was	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	good	at	was	 market 	 ing 	 	and	 trick 	 ery 	 	.
and	so	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	one	thing	the	gang	would	do	is	--	you	know	,	the	gang	 lead 	 ers 	 	would	have	big	 entourage 	 s 	 	,	and	they	'd	drive	 f 	 ancy 	 	 car 	 s 	 	and	have	 f 	 ancy 	 	 jewel 	 ry 	 	.
so	what	sudhir	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 real 	 ized 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	he	hung	out	with	them	more	,	is	that	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	they	did	n't	own	 t 	 hose 	 	 car 	 s 	 	.
they	just	 lease 	 d 	 	them	--	 be 	 cause 	 	they	could	n't	afford	to	own	the	 f 	 ancy 	 	 car 	 s 	 	.
and	they	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	have	gold	 jewel 	 ry 	 	--	they	had	gold	-	plated	 jewel 	 ry 	 	.
it	 go 	 es 	 	back	to	,	you	know	,	the	real	-	real	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	the	fake	-	real	.
and	 re 	 ally 	 	,	they	did	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	to	trick	the	young	people	 in 	 to 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	what	a	great	deal	the	gang	was	going	to	be	.
so	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	they	would	give	a	14	-	year	-	old	kid	--	they	'd	give	him	a	whole	,	you	know	,	roll	of	 bill 	 s 	 	to	hold	.
that	14	-	year	-	old	kid	would	say	:	``	oh	,	well	.	.	.	``	you	know	,	he	would	say	to	his	 friend 	 s 	 	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	look	at	all	the	money	i	got	in	the	gang	.	``	it	was	n't	his	money	,	 un 	 til 	 	he	 s 	 pent 	 	it	.	and	then	 essential 	 ly 	 	he	was	in	debt	to	the	gang	,	and	was	sort	of	an	 indenture 	 d 	 	 serv 	 ant 	 	for	a	while	.
so	i	have	a	couple	 minute 	 s 	 	.
let	me	do	one	last	thing
i	had	n't	thought	i	'd	have	time	to	do	,	which	is	to	talk	about	what	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	,	more	 general 	 ly 	 	,	about	 economic 	 s 	 	from	the	 stud 	 y 	 	of	the	gang	.
so	 economist 	 s 	 	tend	to	talk	in	technical	 word 	 s 	 	.
often	,	our	 the 	 ories 	 	fail	 quit 	 e 	 	 mis 	 er 	 ably 	 	when	we	go	to	the	data	.
but	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	what	's	kind	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	that	in	 th 	 is 	 	setting	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	that	some	of	the	economic	 the 	 ories 	 	that	 work 	 ed 	 	not	so	well	in	the	real	 eco 	 nomy 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	well	in	the	drug	 eco 	 nomy 	 	--
in	some	sense	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 un 	 fet 	 ter 	 ed 	 	 capital 	 ism 	 	.
here	's	an	economic	principle	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	in	labor	 economic 	 s 	 	,	 call 	 ed 	 	a	``	 compens 	 ating 	 	 different 	 ial 	 	.	``
it	's	the	idea	that	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	the	increment	to	 wage 	 s 	 	that	a	 work 	 er 	 	 requir 	 es 	 	to	 leav 	 e 	 	him	 in 	 different 	 	between	 perform 	 ing 	 	two	 task 	 s 	 	--	one	which	is	more	 un 	 pleas 	 ant 	 	than	the	other	--	that	's	what	you	call	a	``	 compens 	 ating 	 	 different 	 ial 	 	.	``
it	's	why	we	think	garbage	men	might	be	paid	more	than	people	who	work	in	 park 	 s 	 	,	ok	?
so	in	the	 word 	 s 	 	of	one	of	the	 member 	 s 	 	of	the	gang	i	think	 make 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	clear	.
so	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	--	i	'm	sort	of	 get 	 ting 	 	 a 	 head 	 	of	 my 	 self 	 	.	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	in	the	gang	,	when	there	's	a	war	going	on	,	that	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	pay	the	foot	 soldier 	 s 	 	twice	 a 	 s 	 	much	money	.
it	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 cept 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	not	 will 	 ing 	 	to	be	at	risk	.
and	the	 word 	 s 	 	of	a	gang	member	capture	it	 quit 	 e 	 	 nice 	 ly 	 	.
he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	would	you	stand	around	here	when	all	 th 	 is 	 	shit	``	--	that	 mean 	 s 	 	 shoot 	 ing 	 	--	``	if	all	 th 	 is 	 	shit	's	going	on	?	no	,	right	?
so	if	i	going	to	be	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	put	my	life	on	the	line	,	then	front	me	the	cash	,	man	.	``	so	 essential 	 ly 	 	,	i	think	the	gang	member	 say 	 s 	 	it	much	more	 articulate 	 ly 	 	than	 do 	 es 	 	the	economist	,	about	what	's	going	on	.
here	's	 an 	 other 	 	one	.
so	 economist 	 s 	 	talk	about	game	 theor 	 y 	 	--	that	every	two	-	person	game	 ha 	 s 	 	a	nash	equilibrium	.
here	's	the	 transl 	 ation 	 	you	get	from	the	gang	member	.
they	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	decision	of	why	they	do	n't	go	shoot	--	one	thing	that	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	be	a	great	business	tactic	in	the	gang	,	if	you	go	and	just	shoot	in	the	air	--	just	shoot	 gun 	 s 	 	in	the	other	gang	's	 territ 	 ory 	 	--	all	the	people	are	 af 	 raid 	 	to	go	buy	 the 	 ir 	 	 drug 	 s 	 	there	.
they	're	going	to	come	 in 	 to 	 	your	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	.
but	here	's	what	he	 say 	 s 	 	about	why	they	do	n't	do	that	.
he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	if	we	start	 shoot 	 ing 	 	around	there	,	``	--	in	the	other	gang	's	 territ 	 ory 	 	--	``	 no 	 body 	 	,	and	,	i	mean	,	you	dig	it	,	 no 	 body 	 	,	going	to	step	on	 the 	 ir 	 	turf	.
but	we	got	ta	be	 care 	 ful 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	can	shoot	around	here	,	too	,	and	then	we	all	 fuck 	 ed 	 	.	``
so	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	 con 	 cept 	 	.
but	then	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 economist 	 s 	 	get	it	wrong	.
so	one	thing	we	 observ 	 ed 	 	in	the	data	is	that	it	 look 	 ed 	 	like	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	...
the	gang	 lead 	 er 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	got	paid	,	ok	?
no	matter	how	bad	it	was	 economic 	 ally 	 	,	he	 al 	 ways 	 	got	 him 	 self 	 	paid	.
so	we	had	some	 the 	 ories 	 	related	to	cash	flow	,	and	lack	of	access	to	capital	 market 	 s 	 	,	and	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	.
but	then	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	gang	member	,	``	well	,	why	is	it	you	 al 	 ways 	 	get	paid	,	and	your	 work 	 ers 	 	do	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	get	paid	?	``	his	 respons 	 e 	 	is	,	``	you	got	all	these	 nig 	 gers 	 	 be 	 low 	 	you	who	want	your	job	,	you	dig	?	if	you	start	taking	 loss 	 es 	 	,	they	see	you	 a 	 s 	 	weak	and	shit	.	``	and	i	thought	about	it	,	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	ceos	often	pay	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	million	-	dollar	 bon 	 uses 	 	,	even	when	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	are	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	money	.
and	it	never	would	 re 	 ally 	 	occur	to	an	economist	that	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	'	weak	and	shit	'	could	 re 	 ally 	 	be	 import 	 ant 	 	.	``
but	 may 	 be 	 	--	 may 	 be 	 	``	weak	and	shit	``	--
 may 	 be 	 	``	weak	and	shit	``	is	an	 import 	 ant 	 	 hypo 	 thesis 	 	that	 need 	 s 	 	more	analysis	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
