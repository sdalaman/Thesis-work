 th 	 is 	 	technology	made	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	impact	on	us	.
it	 change 	 d 	 	the	way	our	 histo 	 ry 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	.
but	it	's	a	technology	so	pervasive	,	so	 in 	 visible 	 	,	that	we	,	for	a	long	time	,	 for 	 got 	 	to	take	it	 in 	 to 	 	account	when	we	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	human	evolution	.
but	we	see	the	 result 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	technology	,	still	.
so	let	's	make	a	little	test	.
so	 every 	 one 	 	of	you	 turn 	 s 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	neighbor	 pleas 	 e 	 	.
turn	and	face	your	 neighbor 	 s 	 	.
 pleas 	 e 	 	,	 al 	 so 	 	on	the	 balc 	 ony 	 	.
 s 	 mile 	 	.	 s 	 mile 	 	.	open	the	 mouth 	 s 	 	.
 s 	 mile 	 	,	friendly	.
do	you	--	do	you	see	any	 can 	 ine 	 	 tee 	 th 	 	?
count	dracula	 tee 	 th 	 	in	the	 mouth 	 s 	 	of	your	 neighbor 	 s 	 	?
of	course	not	.
 be 	 cause 	 	our	 dent 	 al 	 	anatomy	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	made	,	not	for	 tear 	 ing 	 	down	raw	meat	from	 bone 	 s 	 	or	 chew 	 ing 	 	 fibro 	 us 	 	 leav 	 es 	 	for	 hour 	 s 	 	.
it	is	made	for	a	diet	which	is	soft	,	 mush 	 y 	 	,	which	is	 reduc 	 ed 	 	in	 fiber 	 s 	 	,	which	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	 chew 	 able 	 	and	 digest 	 ible 	 	.
 sound 	 s 	 	like	fast	food	,	 do 	 es 	 	n't	it	.
it	's	for	 cook 	 ed 	 	food	.
we	carry	in	our	face	the	proof	that	 cook 	 ing 	 	,	food	 transform 	 ation 	 	,	made	us	what	we	are	.
so	i	would	suggest	that	we	change	how	we	 class 	 ify 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
we	talk	about	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 omnivore 	 s 	 	.
i	would	say	,	we	should	call	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 coctivor 	 s 	 	--	from	coquere	,	to	cook	.
we	are	the	 animal 	 s 	 	who	eat	 cook 	 ed 	 	food	.
no	,	no	,	no	,	no	.	better	--	to	live	of	 cook 	 ed 	 	food	.
so	 cook 	 ing 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	technology	.
it	's	technology	.
i	do	n't	know	how	you	feel	,	but	i	like	to	cook	for	 entertain 	 ment 	 	.
and	you	need	some	design	to	be	 success 	 ful 	 	.
so	,	 cook 	 ing 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	technology	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 allow 	 ed 	 	us	to	 acquir 	 e 	 	what	 br 	 ought 	 	you	all	here	:	the	big	brain	,	 th 	 is 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	cerebral	cortex	we	have	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 brain 	 s 	 	are	expensive	.
 t 	 hose 	 	have	to	pay	 tu 	 ition 	 	 fee 	 s 	 	know	.
but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	,	 metabol 	 ically 	 	 s 	 peaking 	 	,	expensive	.
you	now	,	our	brain	is	two	to	three	percent	of	the	body	mass	,	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	it	uses	25	percent	of	the	total	energy	we	use	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	expensive	.
where	 do 	 es 	 	the	energy	come	from	.	of	course	,	from	food	.
if	we	eat	raw	food	,	we	can	not	 re 	 lease 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	the	energy	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 ing 	 en 	 u 	 ity 	 	of	our	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	,	to	invent	 th 	 is 	 	most	 marvel 	 ous 	 	technology	.
 in 	 visible 	 	--	 every 	 one 	 	of	us	 do 	 es 	 	it	every	day	,	so	to	speak	.
 cook 	 ing 	 	made	it	possible	that	 mutation 	 s 	 	,	natural	 s 	 election 	 s 	 	,	our	environment	,	could	develop	us	.
so	if	we	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	 unleash 	 ing 	 	human	potential	,	which	was	possible	by	 cook 	 ing 	 	and	food	,	why	do	we	talk	so	 bad 	 ly 	 	about	food	?
why	is	it	 al 	 ways 	 	do	and	 do 	 n't 	 s 	 	and	it	's	good	for	you	,	it	's	not	good	for	you	?
i	think	the	good	news	for	me	would	be	if	we	could	go	back	and	talk	about	the	 unleash 	 ing 	 	,	the	 continu 	 ation 	 	of	the	 unleash 	 ing 	 	of	human	potential	.
now	,	 cook 	 ing 	 	 allow 	 ed 	 	 al 	 so 	 	that	we	 be 	 came 	 	a	migrant	species	.
we	 walk 	 ed 	 	out	of	africa	two	 time 	 s 	 	.
we	 populate 	 d 	 	all	the	 eco 	 logies 	 	.
if	you	can	cook	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	can	happen	to	you	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 what 	 ever 	 	you	find	,	you	will	try	to	transform	it	.
it	 keep 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	your	brain	 work 	 ing 	 	.
now	the	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	and	simple	technology	which	was	 develop 	 ed 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 run 	 s 	 	after	 th 	 is 	 	formula	.
take	 some 	 thing 	 	which	 look 	 s 	 	like	food	,	transform	it	,	and	it	 give 	 s 	 	you	a	good	,	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	,	 access 	 ible 	 	energy	.
 th 	 is 	 	technology	 affect 	 ed 	 	two	 organ 	 s 	 	,	the	brain	and	the	gut	,	which	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 affect 	 ed 	 	.
the	brain	could	grow	,	but	the	gut	 actual 	 ly 	 	shrunk	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	it	's	not	obvious	to	be	honest	.
but	it	shrunk	to	60	percent	of	 prim 	 ate 	 	gut	of	my	body	mass	.
so	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	 cook 	 ed 	 	food	,	it	's	 eas 	 ier 	 	to	digest	.
now	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	large	brain	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	know	,	is	a	big	advantage	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	influence	your	environment	.
you	can	influence	your	own	 techno 	 logies 	 	you	have	 invent 	 ed 	 	.
you	can	 continu 	 e 	 	to	 innov 	 ate 	 	and	invent	.
now	the	big	brain	did	 th 	 is 	 	 al 	 so 	 	with	 cook 	 ing 	 	.
but	how	did	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	run	 th 	 is 	 	show	?
how	did	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	interfere	?
what	kind	of	 cri 	 ter 	 ia 	 	did	it	use	?
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	taste	reward	and	energy	.
you	know	we	have	up	to	five	 taste 	 s 	 	,	three	of	them	sustain	us	.
sweet	--	energy	.
umami	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 meat 	 y 	 	taste	.
you	need	 protein 	 s 	 	for	 muscle 	 s 	 	,	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	.
 salt 	 y 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	need	salt	,	 other 	 wise 	 	your	electric	body	will	not	work	.
and	two	 taste 	 s 	 	which	protect	you	--	bitter	and	 s 	 our 	 	,	which	are	against	 poison 	 ous 	 	and	 rot 	 ten 	 	material	.
but	of	course	,	they	are	hard	-	wired	but	we	use	them	still	in	a	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	way	.
think	about	 bitter 	 sweet 	 	chocolate	;
or	think	about	the	 acid 	 ity 	 	of	yogurt	--	 wonder 	 ful 	 	--	 mix 	 ed 	 	with	 straw 	 berry 	 	 fruit 	 s 	 	.
so	we	can	make	 mix 	 ture 	 s 	 	of	all	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	thing	 be 	 cause 	 	we	know	that	,	in	 cook 	 ing 	 	,	we	can	transform	it	to	the	form	.
reward	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	more	complex	and	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 integ 	 rative 	 	form	of	our	brain	with	 vari 	 ous 	 	different	 element 	 s 	 	--	the	external	 state 	 s 	 	,	our	internal	 state 	 s 	 	,	how	do	we	feel	,	and	so	on	are	put	together	.
and	 some 	 thing 	 	which	 may 	 be 	 	you	do	n't	like	but	you	are	so	 hung 	 ry 	 	that	you	 re 	 ally 	 	will	be	satisfied	to	eat	.
so	satisfaction	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	part	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	say	,	energy	was	 necess 	 ary 	 	.
now	how	did	the	gut	 actual 	 ly 	 	 particip 	 ate 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	?
and	the	gut	is	a	silent	voice	--
it	's	going	more	for	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
i	use	the	 euphem 	 ism 	 	 digest 	 ive 	 	comfort	--
 actual 	 ly 	 	--	it	's	a	 digest 	 ive 	 	 dis 	 comfort 	 	,	which	the	gut	is	 concern 	 ed 	 	with	.
if	you	get	a	stomach	ache	,	if	you	get	a	little	bit	 bloat 	 ed 	 	,	was	not	the	right	food	,	was	not	the	right	 cook 	 ing 	 	 manipul 	 ation 	 	or	 may 	 be 	 	other	 thing 	 s 	 	went	wrong	.
so	my	story	is	a	tale	of	two	 brain 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	might	surprise	you	,	our	gut	 ha 	 s 	 	a	full	-	fledged	brain	.
all	the	 manage 	 rs 	 	in	the	room	say	,	``	you	do	n't	tell	me	 some 	 thing 	 	new	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	know	,	gut	 feel 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	are	using	.	``
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	you	use	it	and	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	our	gut	is	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	our	 emotion 	 al 	 	 limb 	 ic 	 	system	,
they	do	speak	with	each	other	and	make	 decision 	 s 	 	.
but	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	to	have	a	brain	there	is	that	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	the	big	brain	 ha 	 s 	 	to	talk	with	the	food	,	the	food	 ha 	 s 	 	to	talk	with	the	brain	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	to	learn	 actual 	 ly 	 	how	to	talk	to	the	 brain 	 s 	 	.
now	if	there	's	a	gut	brain	,	we	should	 al 	 so 	 	learn	to	talk	with	 th 	 is 	 	brain	.
now	150	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 anatomist 	 s 	 	 de 	 scribed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 care 	 fully 	 	--	here	is	a	model	of	a	wall	of	a	gut	.
i	took	the	three	 element 	 s 	 	--	stomach	,	small	intestine	and	colon	.
and	 with 	 in 	 	 th 	 is 	 	structure	,	you	see	these	two	 pink 	 ish 	 	 layer 	 s 	 	,	which	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	muscle	.
and	between	 th 	 is 	 	muscle	,	they	found	nervous	 tissue 	 s 	 	,	a	lot	of	nervous	 tissue 	 s 	 	,	which	penetrate	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	muscle	--	penetrate	the	 sub 	 mucosa 	 	,	where	you	have	all	the	 element 	 s 	 	for	the	 immun 	 e 	 	system	.
the	gut	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	largest	 immun 	 e 	 	system	,	 defend 	 ing 	 	your	body	.
it	 penetrate 	 s 	 	the	mucosa	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	layer	which	 actual 	 ly 	 	 touch 	 es 	 	the	food	you	are	 swallow 	 ing 	 	and	you	digest	,	which	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	 lum 	 en 	 	.
now	if	you	think	about	the	gut	,	the	gut	is	--	if	you	could	stretch	it	--	40	 meter 	 s 	 	long	,	the	length	of	a	tennis	court	.
if	we	could	 un 	 roll 	 	it	,	get	out	all	the	 fold 	 s 	 	and	so	on	,	it	would	have	400	sq	.	 meter 	 s 	 	of	surface	.
and	now	 th 	 is 	 	brain	 take 	 s 	 	care	over	 th 	 is 	 	,	to	move	it	with	the	 muscle 	 s 	 	and	to	do	defend	the	surface	and	,	of	course	,	digest	our	food	we	cook	.
so	if	we	give	you	a	 specific 	 ation 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	brain	,	which	is	autonomous	,	have	500	million	nerve	 cell 	 s 	 	,	100	million	 neuro 	 ns 	 	--	so	around	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	cat	brain	,	so	there	 sleep 	 s 	 	a	little	cat	--	 think 	 s 	 	for	 it 	 self 	 	,	 optimize 	 s 	 	 what 	 ever 	 	it	 digest 	 s 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	20	different	 neuro 	 n 	 	 type 	 s 	 	.
it	's	got	the	same	 divers 	 ity 	 	you	find	 actual 	 ly 	 	in	a	pig	brain	,	where	you	have	100	billion	 neuro 	 ns 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	autonomous	 organize 	 d 	 	 micro 	 circuit 	 s 	 	,
 ha 	 s 	 	these	 program 	 s 	 	which	run	.
it	 sense 	 s 	 	the	food	;	it	 know 	 s 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	to	do	.
it	 sense 	 s 	 	it	by	chemical	 mean 	 s 	 	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	by	 mechanic 	 al 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	move	the	food	--	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	mix	all	the	 vari 	 ous 	 	 element 	 s 	 	which	we	need	for	 digest 	 ion 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	control	of	muscle	is	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	you	know	,	there	can	be	 re 	 flex 	 es 	 	.
if	you	do	n't	like	a	food	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	if	you	're	a	child	,	you	 ga 	 g 	 	.
it	's	 th 	 is 	 	brain	which	 make 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 flex 	 	.
and	then	 final 	 ly 	 	,	it	 control 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	the	 secret 	 ion 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 mole 	 cular 	 	 machine 	 ry 	 	,	which	 actual 	 ly 	 	 digest 	 s 	 	the	food	we	cook	.
now	how	do	the	two	 brain 	 s 	 	work	with	each	other	?
i	took	here	a	model	from	 robotic 	 s 	 	--
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 sub 	 su 	 mption 	 	 architect 	 ure 	 	.
what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	is	that	we	have	a	 layer 	 ed 	 	control	system	.
the	lower	layer	,	our	gut	brain	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	own	 goal 	 s 	 	--	 digest 	 ion 	 	defense	--	and	we	have	the	 high 	 er 	 	brain	with	the	goal	of	 integ 	 ration 	 	and	generating	 behavior 	 s 	 	.
now	both	look	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	blue	 arrow 	 s 	 	--	both	look	to	the	same	food	,	which	is	in	the	 lum 	 en 	 	and	in	the	area	of	your	intestine	.
the	big	brain	 integrate 	 s 	 	 signal 	 s 	 	,	which	come	from	the	running	 program 	 s 	 	of	the	lower	brain	,
but	 sub 	 su 	 mption 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	the	 high 	 er 	 	brain	can	interfere	with	the	lower	.
it	can	replace	,	or	it	can	inhibit	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 signal 	 s 	 	.
so	if	we	take	two	 type 	 s 	 	of	 signal 	 s 	 	--	a	 hung 	 er 	 	signal	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
if	you	have	an	empty	stomach	,	your	stomach	 produce 	 s 	 	a	hormone	 call 	 ed 	 	 gh 	 re 	 lin 	 	.
it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	big	signal	;
it	's	 s 	 ent 	 	to	the	brain	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	go	and	eat	.	``
you	have	stop	 signal 	 s 	 	--
we	have	up	to	eight	stop	 signal 	 s 	 	.
at	 l 	 east 	 	in	my	case	,	they	are	not	 listen 	 ed 	 	to	.
so	what	 happen 	 s 	 	if	the	big	brain	in	the	 integ 	 ration 	 	 over 	 ride 	 s 	 	the	signal	?
so	if	you	 over 	 ride 	 	the	 hung 	 er 	 	signal	,	you	can	have	a	 dis 	 order 	 	,	which	is	 call 	 ed 	 	 ano 	 re 	 xia 	 	.
 de 	 spite 	 	generating	a	 health 	 y 	 	 hung 	 er 	 	signal	,	the	big	brain	 ignor 	 es 	 	it	and	 activate 	 s 	 	different	 program 	 s 	 	in	the	gut	.
the	more	usual	case	is	 over 	 eating 	 	.
it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 take 	 s 	 	the	signal	and	 change 	 s 	 	it	,	and	we	 continu 	 e 	 	,	even	[	 th 	 ough 	 	]	our	eight	 signal 	 s 	 	would	say	,	``	stop	,	 en 	 ough 	 	.
we	have	 transfer 	 red 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	energy	.	``
now	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	is	that	,	 a 	 long 	 	 th 	 is 	 	lower	layer	--	 th 	 is 	 	gut	--	the	signal	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 strong 	 er 	 	and	 strong 	 er 	 	if	 un 	 digest 	 ed 	 	,	but	 digest 	 ible 	 	,	material	could	penetrate	.
 th 	 is 	 	we	found	from	 bar 	 iatric 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	.
that	then	the	signal	would	be	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	high	.
so	now	back	to	the	 cook 	 ing 	 	question	and	back	to	the	design	.
we	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	to	talk	to	the	big	brain	--	taste	and	reward	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	know	.
now	what	would	be	the	language	we	have	to	talk	to	the	gut	brain	that	 it 	 s 	 	 signal 	 s 	 	are	so	strong	that	the	big	brain	can	not	 ignor 	 e 	 	it	?
then	we	would	generate	 some 	 thing 	 	all	of	us	would	like	to	have	--	a	balance	between	the	 hung 	 er 	 	and	the	 sati 	 ation 	 	.
now	i	give	you	,	from	our	research	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	short	claim	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	fat	 digest 	 ion 	 	.
you	have	on	your	left	an	 o 	 live 	 	oil	 drop 	 let 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 o 	 live 	 	oil	 drop 	 let 	 	 get 	 s 	 	 attack 	 ed 	 	by	 enzyme 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	in	vitro	experiment	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	to	work	in	the	intestine	.
now	 every 	 one 	 	would	expect	that	when	the	degradation	of	the	oil	 happen 	 s 	 	,	when	the	 constit 	 uent 	 s 	 	are	 liberate 	 d 	 	,	they	disappear	,	they	go	away	 be 	 cause 	 	they	[	 we 	 re 	 	]	 absorb 	 ed 	 	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	that	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 intric 	 ate 	 	structure	 appear 	 s 	 	.
and	i	hope	you	can	see	that	there	are	some	ring	-	like	 structure 	 s 	 	in	the	middle	image	,	which	is	water	.
 th 	 is 	 	whole	system	 generate 	 s 	 	a	huge	surface	to	allow	more	 enzyme 	 s 	 	to	attack	the	 remain 	 ing 	 	oil	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	on	your	right	side	,	you	see	a	 bubb 	 ly 	 	,	cell	-	like	structure	 appear 	 ing 	 	,	from	which	the	body	will	absorb	the	fat	.
now	if	we	could	take	 th 	 is 	 	language	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	language	of	 structure 	 s 	 	--	and	make	it	 long 	 er 	 	-	 last 	 ing 	 	,	that	it	can	go	through	the	 pass 	 age 	 	of	the	intestine	,	it	would	generate	 strong 	 er 	 	 signal 	 s 	 	.
so	our	research	--	and	i	think	the	research	 al 	 so 	 	at	the	 un 	 ive 	 rs 	 ities 	 	--	are	now	 fix 	 ing 	 	on	these	 point 	 s 	 	to	say	:	how	can	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	might	sound	trivial	now	to	you	--	how	can	we	change	 cook 	 ing 	 	?
how	can	we	cook	that	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	language	 develop 	 ed 	 	?
so	what	we	have	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	not	an	omnivore	's	dilemma	.
we	have	a	coctivor	's	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	over	the	last	two	million	 year 	 s 	 	which	taste	and	reward	--	 quit 	 e 	 	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	to	cook	--	to	 pleas 	 e 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	to	satisfy	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
if	we	add	the	 m 	 atrix 	 	,	if	we	add	the	structure	language	,	which	we	have	to	learn	,	when	we	learn	it	,	then	we	can	put	it	back	;	and	around	energy	,	we	could	generate	a	balance	,	which	 come 	 s 	 	out	from	our	 re 	 ally 	 	primordial	operation	:	 cook 	 ing 	 	.
so	,	to	make	 cook 	 ing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	element	,	i	would	say	even	 philosoph 	 ers 	 	have	to	change	and	have	to	 final 	 ly 	 	 recogn 	 ize 	 	that	 cook 	 ing 	 	is	what	made	us	.
so	i	would	say	,	 co 	 quo 	 	 er 	 go 	 	sum	:	i	cook	,	 there 	 fore 	 	i	am	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
