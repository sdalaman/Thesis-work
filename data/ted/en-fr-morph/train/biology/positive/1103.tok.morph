 to 	 day 	 	i	want	to	talk	about	design	,	but	not	design	 a 	 s 	 	we	 usual 	 ly 	 	think	about	it	.
i	want	to	talk	about	what	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	now	in	our	scientific	,	 bio 	 techno 	 logical 	 	culture	,	where	,	for	 re 	 ally 	 	the	first	time	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	we	have	the	power	to	design	bodies	,	to	design	animal	bodies	,	to	design	human	bodies	.
in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	our	planet	,	there	have	 be 	 en 	 	three	great	 wave 	 s 	 	of	evolution	.
the	first	wave	of	evolution	is	what	we	think	of	 a 	 s 	 	darwinian	evolution	.
so	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	all	know	,	species	lived	in	 part 	 icular 	 	 eco 	 logical 	 	 niche 	 s 	 	and	 part 	 icular 	 	 environment 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 pressure 	 s 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 environment 	 s 	 	 select 	 ed 	 	which	 change 	 s 	 	,	through	random	mutation	in	species	,	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	be	 preserve 	 d 	 	.
then	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	 steppe 	 d 	 	out	of	the	darwinian	flow	of	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	and	 create 	 d 	 	the	second	great	wave	of	evolution	,	which	was	we	 change 	 d 	 	the	environment	in	which	we	 evolv 	 ed 	 	.
we	 alter 	 ed 	 	our	 eco 	 logical 	 	niche	by	creating	 civil 	 ization 	 	.
and	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	the	second	great	--	couple	100,000	 year 	 s 	 	,	150,000	 year 	 s 	 	--	flow	of	our	evolution	.
by	changing	our	environment	,	we	put	new	 pressure 	 s 	 	on	our	bodies	to	evolve	.
 whet 	 her 	 	it	was	through	 settl 	 ing 	 	down	in	 agricultur 	 al 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	,	all	the	way	through	modern	medicine	,	we	have	 change 	 d 	 	our	own	evolution	.
now	we	're	 enter 	 ing 	 	a	third	great	wave	of	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	:	``	intentional	evolution	,	``	``	evolution	by	design	``	--	 ver 	 y 	 	different	than	intelligent	design	--	 where 	 by 	 	we	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	now	 intentional 	 ly 	 	 design 	 ing 	 	and	 alter 	 ing 	 	the	 physiologic 	 al 	 	 form 	 s 	 	that	inhabit	our	planet	.
so	i	want	to	take	you	through	a	kind	of	 whirl 	 wind 	 	tour	of	that	and	then	at	the	end	talk	a	little	bit	about	what	some	of	the	 implic 	 ations 	 	are	for	us	and	for	our	species	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	our	 culture 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	change	.
now	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	it	for	a	long	time	.
we	 start 	 ed 	 	 select 	 ively 	 	 breed 	 ing 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	if	you	think	of	 dog 	 s 	 	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 dog 	 s 	 	are	now	 intentional 	 ly 	 	-	designed	 creature 	 s 	 	.
there	is	n't	a	dog	on	 th 	 is 	 	earth	that	's	a	natural	creature	.
 dog 	 s 	 	are	the	result	of	 select 	 ively 	 	 breed 	 ing 	 	 trait 	 s 	 	that	we	like	.
but	we	had	to	do	it	the	hard	way	in	the	old	 day 	 s 	 	by	 choos 	 ing 	 	 off 	 spring 	 	that	 look 	 ed 	 	a	 part 	 icular 	 	way	and	then	 breed 	 ing 	 	them	.
we	do	n't	have	to	do	it	that	way	 any 	 more 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 beef 	 al 	 o 	 	.
a	 beef 	 al 	 o 	 	is	a	buffalo	-	cattle	hybrid	.
and	they	are	now	making	them	,	and	 some 	 day 	 	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	soon	,	you	will	have	 beef 	 al 	 o 	 	 pat 	 ties 	 	in	your	local	 super 	 market 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ge 	 ep 	 	,	a	goat	-	sheep	hybrid	.	the	 scientist 	 s 	 	that	made	 th 	 is 	 	cute	little	creature	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 s 	 laughter 	 ing 	 	it	and	eating	it	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	.
i	think	they	 s 	 aid 	 	it	 taste 	 d 	 	like	chicken	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	cama	.
a	cama	is	a	camel	-	llama	hybrid	,	 create 	 d 	 	to	try	to	get	the	 hard 	 iness 	 	of	a	camel	with	some	of	the	 personal 	 ity 	 	 trait 	 s 	 	of	a	llama	.
and	they	are	now	using	these	in	certain	 culture 	 s 	 	.
then	there	's	the	 lig 	 er 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	largest	cat	in	the	world	--	the	lion	-	tiger	hybrid	.
it	's	 big 	 ger 	 	than	a	tiger	.
and	in	the	case	of	the	 lig 	 er 	 	,	there	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	one	or	two	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 een 	 	in	the	wild	.
but	these	 we 	 re 	 	 create 	 d 	 	by	 scientist 	 s 	 	using	both	 select 	 ive 	 	 breed 	 ing 	 	and	genetic	technology	.
and	then	 final 	 ly 	 	,	 every 	 body 	 	's	 favor 	 ite 	 	,	the	 zo 	 rse 	 	.
 non 	 e 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	photoshopped	.	these	are	real	 creature 	 s 	 	.
and	so	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	is	using	genetic	 enhance 	 ment 	 	,	or	genetic	 manipul 	 ation 	 	,	of	normal	 select 	 ive 	 	 breed 	 ing 	 	 push 	 ed 	 	a	little	bit	through	 genetic 	 s 	 	.
and	if	that	 we 	 re 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	was	about	,	then	it	would	be	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	.
but	 some 	 thing 	 	much	,	much	more	 power 	 ful 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	now	.
these	are	normal	 mammal 	 ian 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	 genetic 	 ally 	 	engineered	with	a	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nt 	 	gene	taken	out	of	deep	-	sea	 jelly 	 fish 	 	.
we	all	know	that	some	deep	-	sea	 creature 	 s 	 	glow	.
well	,	they	've	now	taken	that	gene	,	that	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nt 	 	gene	,	and	put	it	 in 	 to 	 	mammal	 cell 	 s 	 	.
these	are	normal	 cell 	 s 	 	.
and	what	you	see	here	is	these	 cell 	 s 	 	 glow 	 ing 	 	in	the	dark	under	certain	 wave 	 length 	 s 	 	of	light	.
once	they	could	do	that	with	 cell 	 s 	 	,	they	could	do	it	with	 organism 	 s 	 	.
so	they	did	it	with	mouse	 pup 	 s 	 	,	 kit 	 ten 	 s 	 	.
and	by	the	way	,	the	reason	the	 kit 	 ten 	 s 	 	here	are	 o 	 range 	 	and	these	are	green	is	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	a	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nt 	 	gene	from	coral	,	while	 th 	 is 	 	is	from	 jelly 	 fish 	 	.
they	did	it	with	 pig 	 s 	 	.	they	did	it	with	 pup 	 pies 	 	.	and	,	in	fact	,	they	did	it	with	 monkey 	 s 	 	.
and	if	you	can	do	it	with	 monkey 	 s 	 	--	 th 	 ough 	 	the	great	leap	in	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 genetic 	 ally 	 	 manipul 	 ate 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	between	 monkey 	 s 	 	and	 ape 	 s 	 	--	if	they	can	do	it	in	 monkey 	 s 	 	,	they	can	 prob 	 ably 	 	figure	out	how	to	do	it	in	 ape 	 s 	 	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	they	can	do	it	in	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	it	is	 theoretic 	 ally 	 	possible	that	before	too	long	we	will	be	 bio 	 techno 	 logically 	 	 cap 	 able 	 	of	creating	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	that	glow	in	the	dark	.
be	 eas 	 ier 	 	to	find	us	at	night	.
and	in	fact	,	right	now	in	 man 	 y 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	you	can	go	out	and	you	can	buy	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nt 	 	 pet 	 s 	 	.
these	are	zebra	fish	.	they	're	 normal 	 ly 	 	black	and	silver	.
these	are	zebra	fish	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	 genetic 	 ally 	 	engineered	to	be	yellow	,	green	,	red	,	and	they	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	now	in	certain	 state 	 s 	 	.
other	 state 	 s 	 	have	 bann 	 ed 	 	them	.
 no 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	what	to	do	with	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 creature 	 s 	 	.
there	is	no	area	of	the	government	--	not	the	epa	or	the	fda	--	that	 control 	 s 	 	 genetic 	 ally 	 	-	engineered	 pet 	 s 	 	.
and	so	some	 state 	 s 	 	have	 decide 	 d 	 	to	allow	them	,	some	 state 	 s 	 	have	 decide 	 d 	 	to	ban	them	.
some	of	you	may	have	read	about	the	fda	's	 consider 	 ation 	 	right	now	of	 genetic 	 ally 	 	-	engineered	 s 	 al 	 mon 	 	.
the	 s 	 al 	 mon 	 	on	top	is	a	 genetic 	 ally 	 	engineered	chinook	 s 	 al 	 mon 	 	,	using	a	gene	from	these	 s 	 al 	 mon 	 	and	from	one	other	fish	that	we	eat	,	to	make	it	grow	much	 fast 	 er 	 	using	a	lot	less	feed	.	and	right	now	the	fda	is	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	a	final	decision	on	 whet 	 her 	 	,	 pre 	 tty 	 	soon	,	you	could	be	eating	 th 	 is 	 	fish	--	it	'll	be	 s 	 old 	 	in	the	 store 	 s 	 	.
and	before	you	get	too	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	it	,	here	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	the	 major 	 ity 	 	of	food	you	buy	in	the	 super 	 market 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 genetic 	 ally 	 	-	 modifi 	 ed 	 	 component 	 s 	 	to	it	.
so	even	 a 	 s 	 	we	worry	about	it	,	we	have	 allow 	 ed 	 	it	to	go	on	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	--	much	different	in	europe	--	 with 	 out 	 	any	 regulat 	 ion 	 	,	and	even	 with 	 out 	 	any	 ident 	 ification 	 	on	the	package	.
these	are	all	the	first	 clon 	 ed 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	type	.
so	in	the	lower	right	here	,	you	have	dolly	,	the	first	 clon 	 ed 	 	sheep	--	now	 hap 	 pi 	 ly 	 	 stuff 	 ed 	 	in	a	museum	in	edinburgh	;	ralph	the	rat	,	the	first	 clon 	 ed 	 	rat	;	cc	the	cat	,	for	 clon 	 ed 	 	cat	;	snuppy	,	the	first	 clon 	 ed 	 	dog	--	snuppy	for	seoul	national	university	puppy	--	 create 	 d 	 	in	south	korea	by	the	 ver 	 y 	 	same	man	that	some	of	you	may	remember	had	to	end	up	 re 	 sign 	 ing 	 	in	 dis 	 grace 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 claim 	 ed 	 	he	had	 clon 	 ed 	 	a	human	embryo	,	which	he	had	not	.
he	 actual 	 ly 	 	was	the	first	person	to	clone	a	dog	,	which	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	thing	to	do	,	 be 	 cause 	 	dog	 genome 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	plastic	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	prometea	,	the	first	 clon 	 ed 	 	horse	.
it	's	a	haflinger	horse	 clon 	 ed 	 	in	italy	,	a	real	``	gold	ring	``	of	 clon 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 horse 	 s 	 	that	win	 import 	 ant 	 	 race 	 s 	 	who	are	 gel 	 d 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	the	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	to	put	them	out	to	stud	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	.
but	if	you	can	clone	that	horse	,	you	can	have	both	the	advantage	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	 gel 	 d 	 ing 	 	run	in	the	race	and	his	 ident 	 ical 	 	genetic	 duplic 	 ate 	 	can	then	be	put	out	to	stud	.
these	 we 	 re 	 	the	first	 clon 	 ed 	 	 calve 	 s 	 	,	the	first	 clon 	 ed 	 	 gr 	 ey 	 	 wo 	 lv 	 es 	 	,
and	then	,	 final 	 ly 	 	,	the	first	 clon 	 ed 	 	 piglet 	 s 	 	:	alexis	,	chista	,	carrel	,	janie	and	 dot 	 com 	 	.
in	 add 	 ition 	 	,	we	've	 start 	 ed 	 	to	use	 clon 	 ing 	 	technology	to	try	to	 s 	 ave 	 	 en 	 danger 	 ed 	 	species	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	use	of	 animal 	 s 	 	now	to	create	 drug 	 s 	 	and	other	 thing 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	bodies	that	we	want	to	create	.
so	with	 anti 	 th 	 rom 	 bin 	 	in	that	goat	--	that	goat	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 genetic 	 ally 	 	 modifi 	 ed 	 	so	that	the	 molecule 	 s 	 	of	 it 	 s 	 	milk	 actual 	 ly 	 	include	the	molecule	of	 anti 	 th 	 rom 	 bin 	 	that	gtc	 genetic 	 s 	 	 want 	 s 	 	to	create	.
and	then	in	 add 	 ition 	 	,	 trans 	 genic 	 	 pig 	 s 	 	,	 knock 	 out 	 	 pig 	 s 	 	,	from	the	national	institute	of	animal	science	in	south	korea	,	are	 pig 	 s 	 	that	they	are	going	to	use	,	in	fact	,	to	try	to	create	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 drug 	 s 	 	and	other	industrial	 type 	 s 	 	of	 chemical 	 s 	 	that	they	want	the	blood	and	the	milk	of	these	 animal 	 s 	 	to	produce	for	them	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	producing	them	in	an	industrial	way	.
these	are	two	 creature 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 create 	 d 	 	in	order	to	 s 	 ave 	 	 en 	 danger 	 ed 	 	species	.
the	guar	is	an	 en 	 danger 	 ed 	 	 south 	 east 	 	asian	 ung 	 ulate 	 	.
a	 som 	 atic 	 	cell	,	a	body	cell	,	was	taken	from	 it 	 s 	 	body	,	 gest 	 ated 	 	in	the	ovum	of	a	cow	,	and	then	that	cow	 g 	 ave 	 	birth	to	a	guar	.
same	thing	 happen 	 ed 	 	with	the	mouflon	,	where	it	's	an	 en 	 danger 	 ed 	 	species	of	sheep	.
it	was	 gest 	 ated 	 	in	a	regular	sheep	body	,	which	 actual 	 ly 	 	 raise 	 s 	 	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	 bio 	 logical 	 	problem	.
we	have	two	 kind 	 s 	 	of	dna	in	our	bodies	.
we	have	our	 nuclei 	 c 	 	dna	that	 every 	 body 	 	 think 	 s 	 	of	 a 	 s 	 	our	dna	,	but	we	 al 	 so 	 	have	dna	in	our	mitochondria	,	which	are	the	energy	 pack 	 et 	 s 	 	of	the	cell	.
that	dna	is	 pass 	 ed 	 	down	through	our	 mother 	 s 	 	.
so	 re 	 ally 	 	,	what	you	end	up	 hav 	 ing 	 	here	is	not	a	guar	and	not	a	mouflon	,	but	a	guar	with	cow	mitochondria	,	and	 there 	 fore 	 	cow	 mitochondria 	 l 	 	dna	,	and	a	mouflon	with	 an 	 other 	 	species	of	sheep	's	 mitochondria 	 l 	 	dna	.
these	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 hybrid 	 s 	 	,	not	 pur 	 e 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	.
and	it	 raise 	 s 	 	the	question	of	how	we	're	going	to	define	animal	species	in	the	age	of	 bio 	 technology 	 	--	a	question	that	we	're	not	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	yet	how	to	solve	.
 th 	 is 	 	 love 	 ly 	 	creature	is	an	asian	 cock 	 roach 	 	.
and	what	they	've	 d 	 one 	 	here	is	they	've	put	 electro 	 de 	 s 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	 gan 	 glia 	 	and	 it 	 s 	 	brain	and	then	a	 transmit 	 ter 	 	on	top	,	and	it	's	on	a	big	computer	 track 	 ing 	 	ball	.
and	now	,	using	a	 joy 	 stick 	 	,	they	can	 s 	 end 	 	 th 	 is 	 	creature	around	the	lab	and	control	 whet 	 her 	 	it	 go 	 es 	 	left	or	right	,	 forward 	 s 	 	or	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	.
they	've	 create 	 d 	 	a	kind	of	insect	bot	,	or	 bug 	 bot 	 	.
it	 get 	 s 	 	 wo 	 rse 	 	than	that	--	or	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	better	than	that	.
 th 	 is 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	is	one	of	darpa	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	--	darpa	is	the	defense	research	 age 	 ncy 	 	--	one	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 project 	 s 	 	.
these	 golia 	 th 	 	 beetle 	 s 	 	are	wired	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 wing 	 s 	 	.
they	have	a	computer	chip	 s 	 trapped 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 back 	 s 	 	,	and	they	can	fly	these	 creature 	 s 	 	around	the	lab	.
they	can	make	them	go	left	,	right	.	they	can	make	them	take	off	.
they	ca	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	make	them	land	.
they	put	them	about	one	inch	above	the	ground	,	and	then	they	shut	 every 	 thing 	 	off	and	they	go	pfft	.
but	it	's	the	 close 	 st 	 	they	can	get	to	a	 land 	 ing 	 	.
and	in	fact	,	 th 	 is 	 	technology	 ha 	 s 	 	gotten	so	 develop 	 ed 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	creature	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	moth	--
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	moth	in	 it 	 s 	 	pupa	stage	,	and	that	's	when	they	put	the	 wire 	 s 	 	in	and	they	put	in	the	computer	technology	,
so	that	when	the	moth	 actual 	 ly 	 	 emerge 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	moth	,	it	is	 al 	 ready 	 	 pre 	 wired 	 	.
the	 wire 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 ready 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	body	,	and	they	can	just	hook	it	up	to	 the 	 ir 	 	technology	,	and	now	they	've	got	these	 bug 	 bots 	 	that	they	can	 s 	 end 	 	out	for	 sur 	 veil 	 lance 	 	.
they	can	put	little	 camera 	 s 	 	on	them	and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 some 	 day 	 	deliver	other	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 ordin 	 ance 	 	to	warzones	.
it	's	not	just	 insect 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 rat 	 bot 	 	,	or	the	robo	-	rat	by	sanjiv	talwar	at	suny	 down 	 state 	 	.

the	 scientist 	 s 	 	can	make	 th 	 is 	 	creature	go	left	,	right	.
they	have	it	running	through	 maze 	 s 	 	,	 controll 	 ing 	 	where	it	's	going	.
they	've	now	 create 	 d 	 	an	 organ 	 ic 	 	robot	.

we	've	taken	away	the	 auto 	 nomy 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	animal	.	``
i	'll	get	back	to	that	in	a	minute	.
there	's	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 en 	 	work	 d 	 one 	 	with	 monkey 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	miguel	nicolelis	of	 du 	 ke 	 	.
he	took	owl	 monkey 	 s 	 	,	wired	them	up	so	that	a	computer	 watch 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 brain 	 s 	 	while	they	 move 	 d 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	looking	at	the	 move 	 ment 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	right	arm	.
the	computer	 learn 	 ed 	 	what	the	monkey	brain	did	to	move	 it 	 s 	 	arm	in	 vari 	 ous 	 	ways	.
they	then	 hook 	 ed 	 	it	up	to	a	 prost 	 hetic 	 	arm	,	which	you	see	here	in	the	picture	,	put	the	arm	in	 an 	 other 	 	room	.
 pre 	 tty 	 	soon	,	the	computer	 learn 	 ed 	 	,	by	 read 	 ing 	 	the	monkey	's	 brain 	 wave 	 s 	 	,	to	make	that	arm	in	the	other	room	do	 what 	 ever 	 	the	monkey	's	arm	did	.
then	he	put	a	video	monitor	in	the	monkey	's	cage	that	 show 	 ed 	 	the	monkey	 th 	 is 	 	 prost 	 hetic 	 	arm	,	and	the	monkey	got	 fascinate 	 d 	 	.
the	monkey	 recogn 	 ized 	 	that	 what 	 ever 	 	she	did	with	her	arm	,	 th 	 is 	 	 prost 	 hetic 	 	arm	would	do	.
and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	she	was	moving	it	and	moving	it	,	and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 stop 	 ped 	 	moving	her	right	arm	and	,	 star 	 ing 	 	at	the	screen	,	could	move	the	 prost 	 hetic 	 	arm	in	the	other	room	 on 	 ly 	 	with	her	 brain 	 wave 	 s 	 	--	which	 mean 	 s 	 	that	monkey	 be 	 came 	 	the	first	 prim 	 ate 	 	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	the	world	to	have	three	 in 	 dependent 	 	functional	 arm 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	not	just	technology
that	we	're	 put 	 ting 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	thomas	demarse	at	the	university	of	florida	.
he	took	20,000	and	then	60,000	 dis 	 aggreg 	 ated 	 	rat	 neuro 	 ns 	 	--	so	these	are	just	individual	 neuro 	 ns 	 	from	 rat 	 s 	 	--	put	them	on	a	chip	.
they	self	-	 aggreg 	 ated 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	network	,	 be 	 came 	 	an	 integrate 	 d 	 	chip	.
and	he	used	that	 a 	 s 	 	the	it	piece	of	a	 mechan 	 ism 	 	which	ran	a	flight	 simul 	 ator 	 	.
so	now	we	have	 organ 	 ic 	 	computer	 chip 	 s 	 	made	out	of	living	,	self	-	 aggreg 	 ating 	 	 neuro 	 ns 	 	.
 final 	 ly 	 	,	mussa	-	ivaldi	of	 north 	 western 	 	took	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	 in 	 tact 	 	,	 in 	 dependent 	 	 lamp 	 re 	 y 	 	eel	brain	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	brain	from	a	 lamp 	 re 	 y 	 	eel	.
it	is	living	--	fully	-	 in 	 tact 	 	brain	in	a	nutrient	medium	with	these	 electro 	 de 	 s 	 	going	off	to	the	 side 	 s 	 	,	 attach 	 ed 	 	 photo 	 sensitive 	 	 sensor 	 s 	 	to	the	brain	,	put	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	cart	--	here	's	the	cart	,	the	brain	is	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	in	the	middle	--	and	using	 th 	 is 	 	brain	 a 	 s 	 	the	sole	processor	for	 th 	 is 	 	cart	,	when	you	turn	on	a	light	and	shine	it	at	the	cart	,	the	cart	 move 	 s 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	the	light	;	when	you	turn	it	off	,	it	 move 	 s 	 	away	.
it	's	 photo 	 philic 	 	.
so	now	we	have	a	complete	living	 lamp 	 re 	 y 	 	eel	brain	.
is	it	 think 	 ing 	 	 lamp 	 re 	 y 	 	eel	 thought 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	in	 it 	 s 	 	nutrient	medium	?
i	do	n't	know	,	but	in	fact	it	is	a	fully	living	brain	that	we	have	 manage 	 d 	 	to	keep	 al 	 ive 	 	to	do	our	 bid 	 d 	 ing 	 	.
so	,	we	are	now	at	the	stage	where	we	are	creating	 creature 	 s 	 	for	our	own	 purpose 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	mouse	 create 	 d 	 	by	charles	vacanti	of	the	university	of	massachusetts	.
he	 alter 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	mouse	so	that	it	was	 genetic 	 ally 	 	engineered	to	have	skin	that	was	less	 immuno 	 re 	 active 	 	to	human	skin	,	put	a	polymer	 scaffold 	 ing 	 	of	an	ear	under	it	and	 create 	 d 	 	an	ear	that	could	then	be	taken	off	the	mouse	and	 transplant 	 ed 	 	onto	a	human	 be 	 ing 	 	.
genetic	 engineer 	 ing 	 	 couple 	 d 	 	with	polymer	physiotechnology	 couple 	 d 	 	with	 xeno 	 transplant 	 ation 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	where	we	are	in	 th 	 is 	 	process	.
 final 	 ly 	 	,	not	that	long	ago	,	craig	venter	 create 	 d 	 	the	first	artificial	cell	,	where	he	took	a	cell	,	took	a	dna	 synthesize 	 r 	 	,	which	is	a	machine	,	 create 	 d 	 	an	artificial	genome	,	put	it	in	a	different	cell	--	the	genome	was	not	of	the	cell	he	put	it	in	--	and	that	cell	then	 re 	 produce 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	other	cell	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	that	was	the	first	creature	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	the	world	that	had	a	computer	 a 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	parent	--	it	did	not	have	an	 organ 	 ic 	 	parent	.
and	so	,	 ask 	 s 	 	the	economist	:	``	the	first	artificial	organism	and	 it 	 s 	 	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	.	``
so	you	may	have	thought	that	the	creation	of	life	was	going	to	happen	in	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 look 	 ed 	 	like	that	.
but	in	fact	,	that	's	not	what	frankenstein	's	lab	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	frankenstein	's	lab	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	dna	 synthesize 	 r 	 	,	and	here	at	the	bottom	are	just	 bottle 	 s 	 	of	a	,	t	,	c	and	g	--	the	four	 chemical 	 s 	 	that	make	up	our	dna	chain	.
and	so	,	we	need	to	ask	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	some	 question 	 s 	 	.
for	the	first	time	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	planet	,	we	are	able	to	 direct 	 ly 	 	design	 organism 	 s 	 	.
we	can	 manipul 	 ate 	 	the	 plasma 	 s 	 	of	life	with	unprecedented	power	,
and	it	 confer 	 s 	 	on	us	a	 respons 	 ibility 	 	.
is	 every 	 thing 	 	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
is	it	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	to	 manipul 	 ate 	 	and	create	 what 	 ever 	 	 creature 	 s 	 	we	want	?
do	we	have	free	reign	to	design	 animal 	 s 	 	?
do	we	get	to	go	 some 	 day 	 	to	 pet 	 s 	 	'	r	'	us	and	say	,	``	look	,	i	want	a	dog	.
i	'd	like	it	to	have	the	head	of	a	dachshund	,	the	body	of	a	 retrieve 	 r 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	some	pink	fur	,	and	let	's	make	it	glow	in	the	dark	``	?
 do 	 es 	 	industry	get	to	create	 creature 	 s 	 	who	,	in	 the 	 ir 	 	milk	,	in	 the 	 ir 	 	blood	,	and	in	 the 	 ir 	 	saliva	and	other	 bod 	 ily 	 	 fluid 	 s 	 	,	create	the	 drug 	 s 	 	and	industrial	 molecule 	 s 	 	we	want	and	then	 ware 	 house 	 	them	 a 	 s 	 	 organ 	 ic 	 	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	?
do	we	get	to	create	 organ 	 ic 	 	 robot 	 s 	 	,	where	we	 re 	 move 	 	the	 auto 	 nomy 	 	from	these	 animal 	 s 	 	and	turn	them	just	 in 	 to 	 	our	 play 	 thing 	 s 	 	?
and	then	the	final	step	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	once	we	perfect	these	 techno 	 logies 	 	in	 animal 	 s 	 	and	we	start	using	them	in	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	what	are	the	 ethic 	 al 	 	 guide 	 lines 	 	that	we	will	use	then	?
it	's	 al 	 ready 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	.	it	's	not	science	fiction	.
we	are	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	using	these	 thing 	 s 	 	in	 animal 	 s 	 	,	some	of	them	we	're	 al 	 ready 	 	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	use	on	our	own	bodies	.
we	are	now	taking	control	of	our	own	evolution	.
we	are	 direct 	 ly 	 	 design 	 ing 	 	the	future	of	the	species	of	 th 	 is 	 	planet	.
it	 confer 	 s 	 	 up 	 on 	 	us	an	enormous	 respons 	 ibility 	 	that	is	not	just	the	 respons 	 ibility 	 	of	the	 scientist 	 s 	 	and	the	 ethic 	 ists 	 	who	are	 think 	 ing 	 	about	it	and	writing	about	it	now	.
it	is	the	 respons 	 ibility 	 	of	 every 	 body 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	will	determine	what	kind	of	planet	and	what	kind	of	bodies	we	will	have	in	the	future	.
