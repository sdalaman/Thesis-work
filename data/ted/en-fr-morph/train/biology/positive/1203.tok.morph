each	of	you	 possess 	 es 	 	the	most	 power 	 ful 	 	,	 danger 	 ous 	 	and	 sub 	 ver 	 s 	 ive 	 	trait	that	natural	 s 	 election 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	 de 	 vis 	 ed 	 	.
it	's	a	piece	of	neural	audio	technology	for	 re 	 wiring 	 	other	people	's	 mind 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	your	language	,	of	course	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 allow 	 s 	 	you	to	implant	a	thought	from	your	mind	 direct 	 ly 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 one 	 	else	's	mind	,	and	they	can	attempt	to	do	the	same	to	you	,	 with 	 out 	 	either	of	you	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	perform	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	when	you	speak	,	you	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	using	a	form	of	 tele 	 metry 	 	not	so	different	from	the	remote	control	 de 	 vice 	 	for	your	 tele 	 vision 	 	.
it	's	just	that	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	that	 de 	 vice 	 	 re 	 lies 	 	on	 puls 	 es 	 	of	 infra 	 red 	 	light	,	your	language	 re 	 lies 	 	on	 puls 	 es 	 	,	discrete	 puls 	 es 	 	,	of	sound	.
and	just	 a 	 s 	 	you	use	the	remote	control	 de 	 vice 	 	to	alter	the	internal	 setting 	 s 	 	of	your	 tele 	 vision 	 	to	suit	your	mood	,	you	use	your	language	to	alter	the	 setting 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	 some 	 one 	 	else	's	brain	to	suit	your	 interest 	 s 	 	.
 language 	 s 	 	are	 gene 	 s 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	,	 get 	 ting 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	they	want	.
and	just	imagine	the	sense	of	wonder	in	a	baby	when	it	first	 discover 	 s 	 	that	,	 mere 	 ly 	 	by	 utter 	 ing 	 	a	sound	,	it	can	get	 object 	 s 	 	to	move	 a 	 cross 	 	a	room	 a 	 s 	 	if	by	magic	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	even	 in 	 to 	 	 it 	 s 	 	mouth	.
now	language	's	 sub 	 ver 	 s 	 ive 	 	power	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 recogn 	 ized 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	 age 	 s 	 	in	 censor 	 ship 	 	,	in	 book 	 s 	 	you	ca	n't	read	,	 phrase 	 s 	 	you	ca	n't	use	and	 word 	 s 	 	you	ca	n't	say	.
in	fact	,	the	tower	of	babel	story	in	the	 b 	 ible 	 	is	a	 f 	 able 	 	and	 war 	 ning 	 	about	the	power	of	language	.
 accord 	 ing 	 	to	that	story	,	early	 human 	 s 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	the	 conce 	 it 	 	that	,	by	using	 the 	 ir 	 	language	to	work	together	,	they	could	build	a	tower	that	would	take	them	all	the	way	to	heaven	.
now	god	,	 anger 	 ed 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	attempt	to	usurp	his	power	,	 destroy 	 ed 	 	the	tower	,	and	then	to	ensure	that	it	would	never	be	 re 	 built 	 	,	he	 scatter 	 ed 	 	the	people	by	giving	them	different	 language 	 s 	 	--	 con 	 fused 	 	them	by	giving	them	different	 language 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 lead 	 s 	 	to	the	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 iron 	 y 	 	that	our	 language 	 s 	 	exist	to	prevent	us	from	 commun 	 ic 	 ating 	 	.
even	 to 	 day 	 	,	we	know	that	there	are	 word 	 s 	 	we	can	not	use	,	 phrase 	 s 	 	we	can	not	say	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	we	do	so	,	we	might	be	 ac 	 cost 	 ed 	 	,	 jail 	 ed 	 	,	or	even	 kill 	 ed 	 	.
and	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	from	a	puff	of	air	 e 	 man 	 ating 	 	from	our	 mouth 	 s 	 	.
now	all	 th 	 is 	 	 fu 	 s 	 s 	 	about	a	single	one	of	our	 trait 	 s 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	us	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	worth	 explain 	 ing 	 	.
and	that	is	how	and	why	did	 th 	 is 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	trait	evolve	,	and	why	did	it	evolve	 on 	 ly 	 	in	our	species	?
that	to	get	an	answer	to	that	question	,	we	have	to	go	to	tool	use	in	the	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	.
now	these	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	are	using	 tool 	 s 	 	,	and	we	take	that	 a 	 s 	 	a	sign	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 intellig 	 ence 	 	.
but	if	they	 re 	 ally 	 	 we 	 re 	 	intelligent	,	why	would	they	use	a	stick	to	 ex 	 tract 	 	 term 	 ites 	 	from	the	ground	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	a	 shove 	 l 	 	?
and	if	they	 re 	 ally 	 	 we 	 re 	 	intelligent	,	why	would	they	crack	open	nuts	with	a	rock	?
why	would	n't	they	just	go	to	a	shop	and	buy	a	bag	of	nuts	that	 some 	 body 	 	else	had	 al 	 ready 	 	 crack 	 ed 	 	open	for	them	?
why	not	?	i	mean	,	that	's	what	we	do	.
now	the	reason	the	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	do	n't	do	that	is	that	they	lack	what	 psycho 	 logists 	 	and	 anthropo 	 logists 	 	call	social	 learn 	 ing 	 	.
they	seem	to	lack	the	ability	to	learn	from	 other 	 s 	 	by	 copy 	 ing 	 	or	 imit 	 ating 	 	or	 simpl 	 y 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	result	,	they	ca	n't	improve	on	 other 	 s 	 	'	 idea 	 s 	 	or	learn	from	 other 	 s 	 	'	 mistak 	 es 	 	--	benefit	from	 other 	 s 	 	'	 wis 	 dom 	 	.
and	so	they	just	do	the	same	thing	over	and	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	.
in	fact	,	we	could	go	away	for	a	million	 year 	 s 	 	and	come	back	and	these	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	would	be	 do 	 ing 	 	the	same	thing	with	the	same	 stick 	 s 	 	for	the	 term 	 ites 	 	and	the	same	 rock 	 s 	 	to	crack	open	the	nuts	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	may	sound	 arrog 	 ant 	 	,	or	even	full	of	 hub 	 ris 	 	.
how	do	we	know	 th 	 is 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	our	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	,	the	homo	 erect 	 us 	 	,	did	.
these	 up 	 right 	 	 ape 	 s 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	on	the	african	savanna	about	two	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	they	made	these	splendid	hand	 axe 	 s 	 	that	fit	 wonder 	 fully 	 	 in 	 to 	 	your	 hand 	 s 	 	.
but	if	we	look	at	the	fossil	record	,	we	see	that	they	made	the	same	hand	axe	over	and	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	for	one	million	 year 	 s 	 	.
you	can	follow	it	through	the	fossil	record	.
now	if	we	make	some	 guess 	 es 	 	about	how	long	homo	 erect 	 us 	 	lived	,	what	 the 	 ir 	 	generation	time	was	,	that	's	about	40,000	 generation 	 s 	 	of	 parent 	 s 	 	to	 off 	 spring 	 	,	and	other	 individual 	 s 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	,	in	which	that	hand	axe	did	n't	change	.
it	's	not	even	clear	that	our	 ver 	 y 	 	close	genetic	 relat 	 ive 	 s 	 	,	the	 neanderthal 	 s 	 	,	had	social	 learn 	 ing 	 	.
 s 	 ure 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	more	 complic 	 ated 	 	than	 t 	 hose 	 	of	homo	 erect 	 us 	 	,	but	they	too	 show 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	little	change	over	the	300,000	 year 	 s 	 	or	so	that	 t 	 hose 	 	species	,	the	 neanderthal 	 s 	 	,	lived	in	eurasia	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	what	 th 	 is 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	us	is	that	,	 contr 	 ary 	 	to	the	old	 ad 	 age 	 	,	``	monkey	see	,	monkey	do	,	``	the	surprise	 re 	 ally 	 	is	that	all	of	the	other	 animal 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	can	not	do	that	--	at	 l 	 east 	 	not	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
and	even	 th 	 is 	 	picture	 ha 	 s 	 	the	suspicious	 tain 	 t 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 rig 	 ged 	 	about	it	--	 some 	 thing 	 	from	a	barnum	&	bailey	circus	.
but	by	 compar 	 ison 	 	,	we	can	learn	.
we	can	learn	by	 watch 	 ing 	 	other	people	and	 copy 	 ing 	 	or	 imit 	 ating 	 	what	they	can	do	.
we	can	then	 choos 	 e 	 	,	from	among	a	range	of	 option 	 s 	 	,	the	best	one	.
we	can	benefit	from	 other 	 s 	 	'	 idea 	 s 	 	.
we	can	build	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 wis 	 dom 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	,	our	 idea 	 s 	 	do	 accumul 	 ate 	 	,	and	our	technology	 progress 	 es 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	cumulative	cultural	 adapt 	 ation 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 anthropo 	 logists 	 	call	 th 	 is 	 	 accumul 	 ation 	 	of	 idea 	 s 	 	,	is	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	 every 	 thing 	 	around	you	in	your	 bust 	 ling 	 	and	 tee 	 ming 	 	 every 	 day 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
i	mean	the	world	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	out	of	all	proportion	to	what	we	would	 recogn 	 ize 	 	even	1,000	or	2,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	cumulative	cultural	 adapt 	 ation 	 	.
the	 chair 	 s 	 	you	're	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	,	the	 light 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 audit 	 orium 	 	,	my	 micro 	 phone 	 	,	the	ipads	and	ipods	that	you	carry	around	with	you	--	all	are	a	result	of	cumulative	cultural	 adapt 	 ation 	 	.
now	to	 man 	 y 	 	 comment 	 ators 	 	,	cumulative	cultural	 adapt 	 ation 	 	,	or	social	 learn 	 ing 	 	,	is	job	 d 	 one 	 	,	end	of	story	.
our	species	can	make	stuff	,	 there 	 fore 	 	we	 prosper 	 ed 	 	in	a	way	that	no	other	species	 ha 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	we	can	even	make	the	``	stuff	of	life	``	--	 a 	 s 	 	i	just	 s 	 aid 	 	,	all	the	stuff	around	us	.
but	in	fact	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	some	time	around	200,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	when	our	species	first	 a 	 rose 	 	and	 acquir 	 ed 	 	social	 learn 	 ing 	 	,	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	 re 	 ally 	 	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	our	story	,	not	the	end	of	our	story	.
 be 	 cause 	 	our	 acquisit 	 ion 	 	of	social	 learn 	 ing 	 	would	create	a	social	and	 evolution 	 ary 	 	dilemma	,	the	 re 	 solution 	 	of	which	,	it	's	fair	to	say	,	would	determine	not	 on 	 ly 	 	the	future	course	of	our	 psycho 	 logy 	 	,	but	the	future	course	of	the	entire	world	.
and	most	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	,	it	'll	tell	us	why	we	have	language	.
and	the	reason	that	dilemma	 a 	 rose 	 	is	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	that	social	 learn 	 ing 	 	is	visual	 t 	 heft 	 	.
if	i	can	learn	by	 watch 	 ing 	 	you	,	i	can	steal	your	best	 idea 	 s 	 	,	and	i	can	benefit	from	your	 effort 	 s 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	put	in	the	time	and	energy	that	you	did	 in 	 to 	 	 develop 	 ing 	 	them	.
if	i	can	watch	which	lure	you	use	to	catch	a	fish	,	or	i	can	watch	how	you	flake	your	hand	axe	to	make	it	better	,	or	if	i	follow	you	 secret 	 ly 	 	to	your	mushroom	patch	,	i	can	benefit	from	your	knowledge	and	 wis 	 dom 	 	and	 skill 	 s 	 	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	even	catch	that	fish	before	you	do	.
social	 learn 	 ing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	is	visual	 t 	 heft 	 	.
and	in	any	species	that	 acquir 	 ed 	 	it	,	it	would	behoove	you	to	hide	your	best	 idea 	 s 	 	,	 l 	 est 	 	 some 	 body 	 	steal	them	from	you	.
and	so	some	time	around	200,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	our	species	 confront 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	crisis	.
and	we	 re 	 ally 	 	had	 on 	 ly 	 	two	 option 	 s 	 	for	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	the	 conflict 	 s 	 	that	visual	 t 	 heft 	 	would	 br 	 ing 	 	.
one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 option 	 s 	 	was	that	we	could	have	 re 	 treat 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	small	family	 group 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	then	the	 benefit 	 s 	 	of	our	 idea 	 s 	 	and	knowledge	would	flow	just	to	our	 relat 	 ive 	 s 	 	.
had	we	 chose 	 n 	 	 th 	 is 	 	option	,	 some 	 time 	 	around	200,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	we	would	 prob 	 ably 	 	still	be	living	like	the	 neanderthal 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	when	we	first	 enter 	 ed 	 	europe	40,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	in	small	 group 	 s 	 	there	are	 few 	 er 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	,	there	are	 few 	 er 	 	 innov 	 ations 	 	.
and	small	 group 	 s 	 	are	more	prone	to	 accident 	 s 	 	and	bad	luck	.
so	if	we	'd	 chose 	 n 	 	that	path	,	our	 evolution 	 ary 	 	path	would	have	led	 in 	 to 	 	the	forest	--	and	 be 	 en 	 	a	short	one	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	.
the	other	option	we	could	 choos 	 e 	 	was	to	develop	the	 system 	 s 	 	of	communication	that	would	allow	us	to	share	 idea 	 s 	 	and	to	cooperate	 among 	 st 	 	 other 	 s 	 	.
 choos 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	option	would	mean	that	a	 vast 	 ly 	 	 great 	 er 	 	fund	of	 accumul 	 ated 	 	knowledge	and	 wis 	 dom 	 	would	 be 	 come 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	to	any	one	individual	than	would	ever	arise	from	 with 	 in 	 	an	individual	family	or	an	individual	person	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	.
well	,	we	chose	the	second	option	,	and	language	is	the	result	.
language	 evolv 	 ed 	 	to	solve	the	crisis	of	visual	 t 	 heft 	 	.
language	is	a	piece	of	social	technology	for	enhancing	the	 benefit 	 s 	 	of	 co 	 operation 	 	--	for	 reach 	 ing 	 	 agree 	 ments 	 	,	for	 s 	 tri 	 king 	 	 deal 	 s 	 	and	for	 coordi 	 nating 	 	our	 activ 	 ities 	 	.
and	you	can	see	that	,	in	a	 develop 	 ing 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	that	was	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	 acquir 	 e 	 	language	,	not	 hav 	 ing 	 	language	would	be	a	like	a	bird	 with 	 out 	 	 wing 	 s 	 	.
just	 a 	 s 	 	 wing 	 s 	 	open	up	 th 	 is 	 	sphere	of	air	for	 bird 	 s 	 	to	exploit	,	language	 open 	 ed 	 	up	the	sphere	of	 co 	 operation 	 	for	 human 	 s 	 	to	exploit	.
and	we	take	 th 	 is 	 	 utter 	 ly 	 	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	a	species	that	is	so	at	home	with	language	,
but	you	have	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	even	the	 simpl 	 est 	 	 act 	 s 	 	of	 ex 	 change 	 	that	we	engage	in	are	 utter 	 ly 	 	dependent	 up 	 on 	 	language	.
and	to	see	why	,	consider	two	 scenario 	 s 	 	from	early	in	our	evolution	.
let	's	imagine	that	you	are	 re 	 ally 	 	good	at	making	 arrow 	 head 	 s 	 	,	but	you	're	 hope 	 less 	 	at	making	the	 wood 	 en 	 	 shaft 	 s 	 	with	the	flight	 feather 	 s 	 	 attach 	 ed 	 	.
two	other	people	you	know	are	 ver 	 y 	 	good	at	making	the	 wood 	 en 	 	 shaft 	 s 	 	,	but	they	're	 hope 	 less 	 	at	making	the	 arrow 	 head 	 s 	 	.
so	what	you	do	is	--	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	people	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 re 	 ally 	 	 acquir 	 ed 	 	language	yet	.
and	let	's	pretend	the	other	one	is	good	at	language	 skill 	 s 	 	.
so	what	you	do	one	day	is	you	take	a	pile	of	 arrow 	 head 	 s 	 	,	and	you	walk	up	to	the	one	that	ca	n't	speak	 ver 	 y 	 	well	,	and	you	put	the	 arrow 	 head 	 s 	 	down	in	front	of	him	,	 hop 	 ing 	 	that	he	'll	get	the	idea	that	you	want	to	trade	your	 arrow 	 head 	 s 	 	for	 finish 	 ed 	 	 arrow 	 s 	 	.
but	he	 look 	 s 	 	at	the	pile	of	 arrow 	 head 	 s 	 	,	 think 	 s 	 	they	're	a	gift	,	 pick 	 s 	 	them	up	,	 s 	 mile 	 s 	 	and	 walk 	 s 	 	off	.
now	you	pursue	 th 	 is 	 	guy	,	 gesticul 	 ating 	 	.
a	scuffle	ensues	and	you	get	 stab 	 bed 	 	with	one	of	your	own	 arrow 	 head 	 s 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	now	 re 	 play 	 	 th 	 is 	 	scene	now	,	and	you	're	 approach 	 ing 	 	the	one	who	 ha 	 s 	 	language	.
you	put	down	your	 arrow 	 head 	 s 	 	and	say	,	``	i	'd	like	to	trade	these	 arrow 	 head 	 s 	 	for	 finish 	 ed 	 	 arrow 	 s 	 	.	i	'll	split	you	50/50	.	``	the	other	one	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	fine	.	 look 	 s 	 	good	to	me	.
we	'll	do	that	.	``	now	the	job	is	 d 	 one 	 	.
once	we	have	language	,	we	can	put	our	 idea 	 s 	 	together	and	cooperate	to	have	a	 prosper 	 ity 	 	that	we	could	n't	have	before	we	 acquir 	 ed 	 	it	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	why	our	species	 ha 	 s 	 	 prosper 	 ed 	 	around	the	world	while	the	rest	of	the	 animal 	 s 	 	 s 	 it 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	 bar 	 s 	 	in	 zoo 	 s 	 	,	 languish 	 ing 	 	.
that	's	why	we	build	space	 shuttle 	 s 	 	and	 cat 	 hedral 	 s 	 	while	the	rest	of	the	world	 stick 	 s 	 	 stick 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	ground	to	 ex 	 tract 	 	 term 	 ites 	 	.
all	right	,	if	 th 	 is 	 	view	of	language	and	 it 	 s 	 	value	in	solving	the	crisis	of	visual	 t 	 heft 	 	is	true	,	any	species	that	 acquir 	 es 	 	it	should	show	an	explosion	of	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	and	 prosper 	 ity 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	the	 archeo 	 logical 	 	record	 show 	 s 	 	.
if	you	look	at	our	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	,	the	 neanderthal 	 s 	 	and	the	homo	 erect 	 us 	 	,	our	 im 	 mediate 	 	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	,	they	're	 con 	 fin 	 ed 	 	to	small	 region 	 s 	 	of	the	world	.
but	when	our	species	 a 	 rose 	 	about	200,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 some 	 time 	 	after	that	we	 quick 	 ly 	 	 walk 	 ed 	 	out	of	africa	and	spread	around	the	entire	world	,	 occupy 	 ing 	 	 near 	 ly 	 	every	 habit 	 at 	 	on	earth	.
now	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	other	species	are	 con 	 fin 	 ed 	 	to	 place 	 s 	 	that	 the 	 ir 	 	 gene 	 s 	 	adapt	them	to	,	with	social	 learn 	 ing 	 	and	language	,	we	could	transform	the	environment	to	suit	our	 need 	 s 	 	.
and	so	we	 prosper 	 ed 	 	in	a	way	that	no	other	animal	 ha 	 s 	 	.
language	 re 	 ally 	 	is	the	most	potent	trait	that	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	 evolv 	 ed 	 	.
it	is	the	most	 valu 	 able 	 	trait	we	have	for	 convert 	 ing 	 	new	 land 	 s 	 	and	 resource 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	more	people	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 gene 	 s 	 	that	natural	 s 	 election 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	 de 	 vis 	 ed 	 	.
language	 re 	 ally 	 	is	the	voice	of	our	 gene 	 s 	 	.
now	 hav 	 ing 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	language	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	we	did	 some 	 thing 	 	peculiar	,	even	bizarre	.
 a 	 s 	 	we	spread	out	around	the	world	,	we	 develop 	 ed 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	different	 language 	 s 	 	.	 current 	 ly 	 	,	there	are	about	seven	or	8,000	different	 language 	 s 	 	spoken	on	earth	.
now	you	might	say	,	well	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	natural	.
 a 	 s 	 	we	diverge	,	our	 language 	 s 	 	are	 natural 	 ly 	 	going	to	diverge	.
but	the	real	 puzzl 	 e 	 	and	 iron 	 y 	 	is	that	the	 great 	 est 	 	density	of	different	 language 	 s 	 	on	earth	is	found	where	people	are	most	 tight 	 ly 	 	 pack 	 ed 	 	together	.
if	we	go	to	the	 is 	 land 	 	of	papua	new	guinea	,	we	can	find	about	800	to	1,000	distinct	human	 language 	 s 	 	,	different	human	 language 	 s 	 	,	spoken	on	that	 is 	 land 	 	 al 	 one 	 	.
there	are	 place 	 s 	 	on	that	 is 	 land 	 	where	you	can	 en 	 counter 	 	a	new	language	every	two	or	three	 mile 	 s 	 	.
now	,	 in 	 credible 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 sound 	 s 	 	,	i	once	met	a	papuan	man	,	and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	him	if	 th 	 is 	 	could	possibly	be	true	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	``	oh	no	.
they	're	far	 close 	 r 	 	together	than	that	.	``	and	it	's	true	;	there	are	 place 	 s 	 	on	that	 is 	 land 	 	where	you	can	 en 	 counter 	 	a	new	language	in	under	a	mile	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	true	of	some	remote	 ocean 	 ic 	 	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	.
and	so	it	 seem 	 s 	 	that	we	use	our	language	,	not	just	to	cooperate	,	but	to	draw	 ring 	 s 	 	around	our	 co 	 operative 	 	 group 	 s 	 	and	to	establish	 ident 	 ities 	 	,	and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	to	protect	our	knowledge	and	 wis 	 dom 	 	and	 skill 	 s 	 	from	 eaves 	 dropping 	 	from	 out 	 side 	 	.
and	we	know	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	when	we	 stud 	 y 	 	different	language	 group 	 s 	 	and	associate	them	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 culture 	 s 	 	,	we	see	that	different	 language 	 s 	 	 s 	 low 	 	the	flow	of	 idea 	 s 	 	between	 group 	 s 	 	.
they	 s 	 low 	 	the	flow	of	 techno 	 logies 	 	.
and	they	even	 s 	 low 	 	the	flow	of	 gene 	 s 	 	.
now	i	ca	n't	speak	for	you	,	but	it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	the	case	that	we	do	n't	have	 s 	 ex 	 	with	people	we	ca	n't	talk	to	.
now	we	have	to	counter	that	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	against	the	evidence	we	've	heard	that	we	might	have	had	some	 ra 	 ther 	 	 dis 	 taste 	 ful 	 	genetic	 d 	 alliance 	 s 	 	with	the	 neanderthal 	 s 	 	and	the	denisovans	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 tend 	 ency 	 	we	have	,	 th 	 is 	 	 seem 	 ing 	 ly 	 	natural	 tend 	 ency 	 	we	have	,	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 isol 	 ation 	 	,	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 keep 	 ing 	 	to	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	 crash 	 es 	 	head	first	 in 	 to 	 	our	modern	world	.
 th 	 is 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	image	is	not	a	map	of	the	world	.
in	fact	,	it	's	a	map	of	facebook	 friend 	 ship 	 	 link 	 s 	 	.
and	when	you	plot	 t 	 hose 	 	 friend 	 ship 	 	 link 	 s 	 	by	 the 	 ir 	 	latitude	and	 long 	 itude 	 	,	it	 liter 	 ally 	 	 draw 	 s 	 	a	map	of	the	world	.
our	modern	world	is	 commun 	 ic 	 ating 	 	with	 it 	 self 	 	and	with	each	other	more	than	it	 ha 	 s 	 	at	any	time	in	 it 	 s 	 	past	.
and	that	communication	,	that	 connect 	 ivity 	 	around	the	world	,	that	 global 	 ization 	 	now	 raise 	 s 	 	a	burden	.
 be 	 cause 	 	these	different	 language 	 s 	 	impose	a	 bar 	 rier 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	've	just	 s 	 een 	 	,	to	the	transfer	of	 good 	 s 	 	and	 idea 	 s 	 	and	 techno 	 logies 	 	and	 wis 	 dom 	 	.
and	they	impose	a	 bar 	 rier 	 	to	 co 	 operation 	 	.
and	 no 	 where 	 	do	we	see	that	more	 clear 	 ly 	 	than	in	the	european	 un 	 ion 	 	,	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	27	member	 count 	 ries 	 	speak	23	official	 language 	 s 	 	.
the	european	 un 	 ion 	 	is	now	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	over	one	billion	 eur 	 os 	 	 annual 	 ly 	 	 transl 	 ating 	 	among	 the 	 ir 	 	23	official	 language 	 s 	 	.
that	's	 some 	 thing 	 	on	the	order	of	1.45	billion	u.s.	 dollar 	 s 	 	on	 transl 	 ation 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	 al 	 one 	 	.
now	think	of	the	 absurd 	 ity 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
if	27	 individual 	 s 	 	from	 t 	 hose 	 	27	member	 state 	 s 	 	 s 	 at 	 	around	table	,	 s 	 peaking 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	23	 language 	 s 	 	,	some	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 mathematic 	 s 	 	will	tell	you	that	you	need	an	 arm 	 y 	 	of	253	 transl 	 ators 	 	to	 anticip 	 ate 	 	all	the	 pair 	 wise 	 	 possibil 	 ities 	 	.
the	european	 un 	 ion 	 	 employ 	 s 	 	a	permanent	staff	of	about	2,500	 transl 	 ators 	 	.
and	in	2007	 al 	 one 	 	--	and	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	there	are	more	 re 	 cent 	 	 figure 	 s 	 	--	 some 	 thing 	 	on	the	order	of	1.3	million	 page 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 transl 	 ated 	 	 in 	 to 	 	english	 al 	 one 	 	.
and	so	if	language	 re 	 ally 	 	is	the	solution	to	the	crisis	of	visual	 t 	 heft 	 	,	if	language	 re 	 ally 	 	is	the	conduit	of	our	 co 	 operation 	 	,	the	technology	that	our	species	derived	to	promote	the	free	flow	and	 ex 	 change 	 	of	 idea 	 s 	 	,	in	our	modern	world	,	we	confront	a	question	.
and	that	question	is	 whet 	 her 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	modern	,	 global 	 ized 	 	world	we	can	 re 	 ally 	 	afford	to	have	all	these	different	 language 	 s 	 	.
to	put	it	 th 	 is 	 	way	,	nature	 know 	 s 	 	no	other	 circum 	 stance 	 	in	which	 functional 	 ly 	 	 equi 	 valent 	 	 trait 	 s 	 	 co 	 exist 	 	.
one	of	them	 al 	 ways 	 	 drive 	 s 	 	the	other	extinct	.
and	we	see	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	 inexor 	 able 	 	march	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 standard 	 ization 	 	.
there	are	 lot 	 s 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	ways	of	 measur 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	--	 weigh 	 ing 	 	them	and	 measur 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	length	--	but	the	metric	system	is	winning	.
there	are	 lot 	 s 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	ways	of	 measur 	 ing 	 	time	,	but	a	 re 	 ally 	 	bizarre	base	60	system	known	 a 	 s 	 	 hour 	 s 	 	and	 minute 	 s 	 	and	 second 	 s 	 	is	 near 	 ly 	 	universal	around	the	world	.
there	are	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	ways	of	 im 	 print 	 ing 	 	cds	or	dvds	,	but	 t 	 hose 	 	are	all	 be 	 ing 	 	 standard 	 ized 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
and	you	can	 prob 	 ably 	 	think	of	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	more	in	your	own	 every 	 day 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
and	so	our	modern	world	now	is	 confront 	 ing 	 	us	with	a	dilemma	.
and	it	's	the	dilemma	that	 th 	 is 	 	chinese	man	 face 	 s 	 	,	who	's	language	is	spoken	by	more	people	in	the	world	than	any	other	single	language	,	and	yet	he	is	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	at	his	 black 	 board 	 	,	 convert 	 ing 	 	chinese	 phrase 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	english	language	 phrase 	 s 	 	.
and	what	 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	is	it	 raise 	 s 	 	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	to	us	that	in	a	world	in	which	we	want	to	promote	 co 	 operation 	 	and	 ex 	 change 	 	,	and	in	a	world	that	might	be	dependent	more	than	ever	before	on	 co 	 operation 	 	to	maintain	and	enhance	our	 level 	 s 	 	of	 prosper 	 ity 	 	,	his	 action 	 s 	 	suggest	to	us	it	might	be	 inevit 	 able 	 	that	we	have	to	confront	the	idea	that	our	 de 	 s 	 tin 	 y 	 	is	to	be	one	world	with	one	language	.
thank	you	.
matt	ridley	:	mark	,	one	question	.
svante	found	that	the	foxp	2	gene	,	which	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	 associate 	 d 	 	with	language	,	was	 al 	 so 	 	 share 	 d 	 	in	the	same	form	in	 neanderthal 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	us	.
do	we	have	any	idea	how	we	could	have	 defeat 	 ed 	 	 neanderthal 	 s 	 	if	they	 al 	 so 	 	had	language	?
mark	pagel	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	question	.
so	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	will	be	familiar	with	the	idea	that	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	gene	 call 	 ed 	 	foxp	2	that	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	 implic 	 ated 	 	in	some	ways	in	the	fine	motor	control	that	's	 associate 	 d 	 	with	language	.
the	reason	why	i	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 tell 	 s 	 	us	that	the	 neanderthal 	 s 	 	had	language	is	--	here	's	a	simple	 analog 	 y 	 	:	ferraris	are	 car 	 s 	 	that	have	 engine 	 s 	 	.
my	car	 ha 	 s 	 	an	engine	,	but	it	's	not	a	ferrari	.
now	the	simple	answer	then	is	that	 gene 	 s 	 	 al 	 one 	 	do	n't	,	all	by	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	determine	the	 out 	 come 	 	of	 ver 	 y 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	language	.
what	we	know	about	 th 	 is 	 	foxp	2	and	 neanderthal 	 s 	 	is	that	they	may	have	had	fine	motor	control	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 mouth 	 s 	 	--	who	 know 	 s 	 	.
but	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	tell	us	they	 necess 	 arily 	 	had	language	.
mr	:	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	.
