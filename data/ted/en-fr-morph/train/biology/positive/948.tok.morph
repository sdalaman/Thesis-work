 th 	 is 	 	strange	-	looking	plant	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	llareta	.
what	 look 	 s 	 	like	moss	 cover 	 ing 	 	 rock 	 s 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	shrub	 com 	 prise 	 d 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 branch 	 es 	 	,	each	 contain 	 ing 	 	 cluster 	 s 	 	of	 tin 	 y 	 	green	 leav 	 es 	 	at	the	end	and	so	 dense 	 ly 	 	 pack 	 ed 	 	together	that	you	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	stand	on	top	of	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	individual	 live 	 s 	 	in	the	atacama	desert	in	chile	,	and	it	 happen 	 s 	 	to	be	3,000	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
it	 al 	 so 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	to	be	a	 relat 	 ive 	 	of	 par 	 s 	 ley 	 	.
for	the	past	five	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 research 	 ing 	 	,	 work 	 ing 	 	with	 biologist 	 s 	 	and	 travel 	 ing 	 	all	over	the	world	to	find	 continu 	 ously 	 	living	 organism 	 s 	 	that	are	2,000	 year 	 s 	 	old	and	 old 	 er 	 	.
the	project	is	part	art	and	part	science	.
there	's	an	 environment 	 al 	 	component	.
and	i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	create	a	 mean 	 s 	 	in	which	to	step	 out 	 side 	 	our	 quo 	 tid 	 ian 	 	experience	of	time	and	to	start	to	consider	a	 deep 	 er 	 	 time 	 scale 	 	.
i	 select 	 ed 	 	2,000	 year 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	my	 minim 	 um 	 	age	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	start	at	what	we	consider	to	be	year	zero	and	work	 back 	 ward 	 	from	there	.
what	you	're	looking	at	now	is	a	tree	 call 	 ed 	 	jomon	sugi	,	living	on	the	remote	 is 	 land 	 	of	yakushima	.
the	tree	was	in	part	a	catalyst	for	the	project	.
i	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 travel 	 ing 	 	in	japan	 with 	 out 	 	an	agenda	other	than	to	photograph	,	and	then	i	heard	about	 th 	 is 	 	tree	that	is	2,180	 year 	 s 	 	old	and	 k 	 new 	 	that	i	had	to	go	visit	it	.
it	was	n't	 un 	 til 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	when	i	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	back	home	in	new	york	that	i	got	the	idea	for	the	project	.
so	it	was	the	 s 	 low 	 	churn	,	if	you	will	.
i	think	it	was	my	 long 	 stand 	 ing 	 	 desir 	 e 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	together	my	interest	in	art	,	science	and	 philosoph 	 y 	 	that	 allow 	 ed 	 	me	to	be	ready	when	the	proverbial	light	bulb	went	on	.
so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 research 	 ing 	 	,	and	to	my	surprise	,	 th 	 is 	 	project	had	never	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	before	in	the	 art 	 s 	 	or	the	 science 	 s 	 	.
and	--	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 naive 	 ly 	 	--	i	was	 surprise 	 d 	 	to	find	that	there	is	n't	even	an	area	in	the	 science 	 s 	 	that	 deal 	 s 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	global	species	 long 	 ev 	 ity 	 	.
so	what	you	're	looking	at	here	is	the	 rhiz 	 ocarpon 	 	 geo 	 graphic 	 um 	 	,	or	map	 lich 	 en 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	around	3,000	 year 	 s 	 	old	and	 live 	 s 	 	in	greenland	,	which	is	a	long	way	to	go	for	some	 lic 	 hens 	 	.
 visit 	 ing 	 	greenland	was	more	like	 travel 	 ing 	 	back	in	time	than	just	 travel 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	far	north	.
it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 prim 	 al 	 	and	more	remote	than	 any 	 thing 	 	i	'd	ever	 experience 	 d 	 	before	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 height 	 ened 	 	by	a	couple	of	 part 	 icular 	 	 experience 	 s 	 	.
one	was	when	i	had	 be 	 en 	 	 drop 	 ped 	 	off	by	boat	on	a	remote	fjord	,	 on 	 ly 	 	to	find	that	the	 archeo 	 logists 	 	i	was	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	meet	 we 	 re 	 	 no 	 where 	 	to	be	found	.
and	it	's	not	like	you	could	 s 	 end 	 	them	a	text	or	shoot	them	an	 e 	 - 	 mail 	 	,	so	i	was	 liter 	 ally 	 	left	to	my	own	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	.
but	 luck 	 ily 	 	,	it	 work 	 ed 	 	out	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,
but	it	was	a	 hum 	 bling 	 	experience	to	feel	so	 dis 	 connect 	 ed 	 	.
and	then	a	few	 day 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	we	had	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	go	 fish 	 ing 	 	in	a	 glaci 	 al 	 	stream	near	our	 camp 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	where	the	fish	 we 	 re 	 	so	abundant	that	you	could	 liter 	 ally 	 	reach	 in 	 to 	 	the	stream	and	grab	out	a	foot	-	long	 trou 	 t 	 	with	your	bare	 hand 	 s 	 	.
it	was	like	 visit 	 ing 	 	a	more	 innoc 	 ent 	 	time	on	the	planet	.
and	then	,	of	course	,	there	's	the	 lic 	 hens 	 	.
these	 lic 	 hens 	 	grow	 on 	 ly 	 	one	centimeter	every	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	.
i	think	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 put 	 s 	 	human	 life 	 span 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	different	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	.
and	what	you	're	looking	at	here	is	an	 a 	 erial 	 	photo	take	over	eastern	oregon	.
and	if	the	title	``	 search 	 ing 	 	for	armillaria	death	 ring 	 s 	 	,	``	 sound 	 s 	 	ominous	,	it	is	.
the	armillaria	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 predator 	 y 	 	fungus	,	 kill 	 ing 	 	certain	species	of	 tree 	 s 	 	in	the	forest	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	more	 benign 	 ly 	 	known	 a 	 s 	 	the	honey	mushroom	or	the	``	 hum 	 ong 	 ous 	 	fungus	``	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 happen 	 s 	 	to	be	one	of	the	world	's	largest	 organism 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
so	with	the	help	of	some	 biologist 	 s 	 	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	the	fungus	,	i	got	some	 map 	 s 	 	and	some	gps	 coordinate 	 s 	 	and	 chart 	 er 	 ed 	 	a	plane	and	 start 	 ed 	 	looking	for	the	death	 ring 	 s 	 	,	the	 circul 	 ar 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	in	which	the	fungus	 kill 	 s 	 	the	 tree 	 s 	 	.
so	i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	if	there	are	any	in	 th 	 is 	 	photo	,	but	i	do	know	the	fungus	is	down	there	.
and	then	 th 	 is 	 	back	down	on	the	ground	and	you	can	see	that	the	fungus	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 invad 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	tree	.
so	that	white	material	that	you	see	in	between	the	bark	and	the	wood	is	the	 mycel 	 ial 	 	felt	of	the	fungus	,	and	what	it	's	 do 	 ing 	 	--	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	 s 	 tran 	 gling 	 	the	tree	to	death	by	 prevent 	 ing 	 	the	flow	of	water	and	 nutrient 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 serv 	 ed 	 	it	 pre 	 tty 	 	well	--
it	's	2,400	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
and	then	from	 under 	 ground 	 	to	 under 	 water 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	brain	coral	living	in	tobago	that	's	around	2,000	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
and	i	had	to	 over 	 come 	 	my	fear	of	deep	water	to	find	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	at	about	60	feet	or	18	 meter 	 s 	 	,	depth	.
and	you	'll	see	,	there	's	some	damage	to	the	surface	of	the	coral	.
that	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 caus 	 ed 	 	by	a	school	of	 par 	 rot 	 	fish	that	had	 start 	 ed 	 	eating	it	,	 th 	 ough 	 	 luck 	 ily 	 	,	they	lost	interest	before	 kill 	 ing 	 	it	.
 luck 	 ily 	 	still	,	it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	out	of	harm	's	way	of	the	 re 	 cent 	 	oil	 s 	 pill 	 	.
but	that	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	we	just	 a 	 s 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	could	have	lost	one	of	the	 old 	 est 	 	living	 thing 	 s 	 	on	the	planet	,	and	the	full	impact	of	that	disaster	now	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	think	is	one	of	the	most	 quiet 	 ly 	 	 resili 	 ent 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	on	the	planet	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 clon 	 al 	 	 colon 	 y 	 	of	quaking	aspen	 tree 	 s 	 	,	living	in	utah	,	that	is	 liter 	 ally 	 	80,000	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
what	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	forest	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	one	tree	.
imagine	that	it	's	one	giant	root	system	and	each	tree	is	a	stem	coming	up	from	that	system	.
so	what	you	have	is	one	giant	,	 interconnect 	 ed 	 	,	 genetic 	 ally 	 	 ident 	 ical 	 	individual	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	living	for	80,000	 year 	 s 	 	.
it	 al 	 so 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	to	be	male	and	,	in	 theor 	 y 	 	 im 	 mortal 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 clon 	 al 	 	tree	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	spruce	gran	picea	,	which	at	9,550	 year 	 s 	 	is	a	mere	 bab 	 e 	 	in	the	 wood 	 s 	 	.
the	location	of	 th 	 is 	 	tree	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ke 	 pt 	 	secret	for	 it 	 s 	 	own	 protect 	 ion 	 	.
i	spoke	to	the	biologist	who	 discover 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	tree	,	and	he	told	me	that	that	 spin 	 d 	 ly 	 	growth	you	see	there	in	the	center	is	most	 like 	 ly 	 	a	product	of	climate	change	.
 a 	 s 	 	it	's	gotten	 warm 	 er 	 	on	the	top	of	the	mountain	,	the	 veget 	 ation 	 	zone	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	changing	.
so	we	do	n't	even	 necess 	 arily 	 	have	to	have	direct	contact	with	these	 organism 	 s 	 	to	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	real	impact	on	them	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	fortingall	yew	--
no	,	i	'm	just	 kid 	 d 	 ing 	 	--
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	fortingall	yew	.
but	i	put	that	slide	in	there	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	often	 ask 	 ed 	 	if	there	are	any	 animal 	 s 	 	in	the	project	.
and	 a 	 side 	 	from	coral	,	the	answer	is	no	.
 do 	 es 	 	 any 	 body 	 	know	how	old	the	 old 	 est 	 	tortoise	is	--
any	 guess 	 es 	 	?
rachel	sussman	:	300	?	no	,	175	is	the	 old 	 est 	 	living	tortoise	,	so	 no 	 where 	 	near	2,000	.
and	then	,	you	might	have	heard	of	 th 	 is 	 	giant	clam	that	was	 discover 	 ed 	 	off	the	coast	of	 north 	 ern 	 	iceland	that	 reach 	 ed 	 	405	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	it	 di 	 ed 	 	in	the	lab	 a 	 s 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 determi 	 ning 	 	 it 	 s 	 	age	.
the	most	 interest 	 ing 	 	 discover 	 y 	 	of	late	,	i	think	is	the	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	 im 	 mortal 	 	 jelly 	 fish 	 	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 observ 	 ed 	 	in	the	lab	to	be	able	to	be	able	to	 re 	 vert 	 	back	to	the	polyp	state	after	 reach 	 ing 	 	full	 matur 	 ity 	 	.
so	that	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	it	's	 high 	 ly 	 	 un 	 like 	 ly 	 	that	any	 jelly 	 fish 	 	would	 surviv 	 e 	 	that	long	in	the	wild	.
and	back	to	the	yew	here	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	it	's	in	a	 church 	 yard 	 	;
it	's	in	scotland	.	it	's	 be 	 hind 	 	a	 protect 	 ive 	 	wall	.
and	there	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	number	or	ancient	 yew 	 s 	 	in	 church 	 yard 	 s 	 	around	the	u.k.	,	but	if	you	do	the	math	,	you	'll	remember	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	yew	 tree 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	there	first	,	then	the	 church 	 es 	 	.
and	now	down	to	 an 	 other 	 	part	of	the	world	.
i	had	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	travel	around	the	limpopo	 pro 	 vince 	 	in	south	africa	with	an	expert	in	 bao 	 bab 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	.
and	we	saw	a	number	of	them	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	most	 like 	 ly 	 	the	 old 	 est 	 	.
it	's	around	2,000	,	and	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	sagole	 bao 	 bab 	 	.
and	you	know	,	i	think	of	all	of	these	 organism 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 palimpsest 	 s 	 	.
they	contain	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 histo 	 ries 	 	 with 	 in 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	and	they	 al 	 so 	 	contain	 record 	 s 	 	of	natural	and	human	 event 	 s 	 	.
and	the	baobabs	in	 part 	 icular 	 	are	a	great	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
you	can	see	that	 th 	 is 	 	one	 ha 	 s 	 	 name 	 s 	 	 carv 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 it 	 s 	 	trunk	,	but	it	 al 	 so 	 	 record 	 s 	 	some	natural	 event 	 s 	 	.
so	the	baobabs	,	 a 	 s 	 	they	get	 old 	 er 	 	,	tend	to	get	 pul 	 py 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 center 	 s 	 	and	hollow	out	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	can	create	great	natural	 shelter 	 s 	 	for	 animal 	 s 	 	,	but	they	've	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 appropriate 	 d 	 	for	some	 ra 	 ther 	 	 dub 	 ious 	 	human	uses	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	a	bar	,	a	 pri 	 son 	 	and	even	a	toilet	 in 	 side 	 	of	a	tree	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	me	to	 an 	 other 	 	 favor 	 ite 	 	of	mine	--	i	think	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	just	so	 un 	 usual 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	plant	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	welwitschia	,	and	it	 live 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	in	 part 	 s 	 	of	 coast 	 al 	 	namibia	and	angola	,	where	it	's	 un 	 ique 	 ly 	 	 adapt 	 ed 	 	to	collect	 moist 	 ure 	 	from	 mis 	 t 	 	coming	off	the	sea	.
and	what	's	more	,	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	tree	.
it	's	a	primitive	 con 	 ifer 	 	.
you	'll	notice	that	it	's	 bear 	 ing 	 	 con 	 es 	 	down	the	center	.
and	what	 look 	 s 	 	like	two	big	 heap 	 s 	 	of	 leav 	 es 	 	,	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	two	single	 leav 	 es 	 	that	get	 shred 	 d 	 ed 	 	up	by	the	harsh	desert	 condition 	 s 	 	over	time	.
and	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	never	 shed 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 leav 	 es 	 	,	so	it	 al 	 so 	 	 bear 	 s 	 	the	 distinct 	 ion 	 	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	 long 	 est 	 	 leav 	 es 	 	in	the	plant	 king 	 dom 	 	.
i	spoke	to	a	biologist	at	the	kirstenbosch	 botanic 	 al 	 	garden	in	capetown	to	ask	him	where	he	thought	 th 	 is 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	plant	came	from	,	and	his	thought	was	that	if	you	travel	around	namibia	,	you	see	that	there	are	a	number	of	 petr 	 ified 	 	 forest 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 log 	 s 	 	are	all	--	the	 log 	 s 	 	are	all	giant	 con 	 ifer 	 ous 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	,	and	yet	there	's	no	sign	of	where	they	might	have	come	from	.
so	his	thought	was	that	 flood 	 ing 	 	in	the	north	of	africa	 actual 	 ly 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 con 	 ifer 	 ous 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	down	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	what	 result 	 ed 	 	was	 th 	 is 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	 adapt 	 ation 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	 un 	 ique 	 	desert	environment	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	think	is	the	most	 poet 	 ic 	 	of	the	 old 	 est 	 	living	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	an	 under 	 ground 	 	forest	.
so	,	i	spoke	to	a	botanist	at	the	pretoria	 botanic 	 al 	 	garden	,	who	 explain 	 ed 	 	that	certain	species	of	 tree 	 s 	 	have	 adapt 	 ed 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	region	.
it	's	 bush 	 felt 	 	region	,	which	is	dry	and	prone	to	a	lot	of	 fire 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	so	what	these	 tree 	 s 	 	have	 d 	 one 	 	is	,	if	you	can	imagine	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	crown	of	the	tree	,	and	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	ground	level	,	imagine	that	the	whole	thing	,	that	whole	bulk	of	the	tree	,	 migr 	 ated 	 	 under 	 ground 	 	,	and	you	just	have	 t 	 hose 	 	 leav 	 es 	 	 peep 	 ing 	 	up	above	the	surface	.
that	way	,	when	a	fire	 roar 	 s 	 	through	,	it	's	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	 get 	 ting 	 	your	 eye 	 brow 	 s 	 	 s 	 ing 	 ed 	 	.
the	tree	can	 eas 	 ily 	 	 re 	 cover 	 	.
these	 al 	 so 	 	tend	to	grow	 clon 	 ally 	 	,	the	 old 	 est 	 	of	which	is	13,000	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
back	in	the	u.s.	,	there	's	a	couple	 plant 	 s 	 	of	similar	age	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 clon 	 al 	 	creosote	bush	,	which	is	around	12,000	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
if	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	in	the	american	west	,	you	know	the	creosote	bush	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	 ubiqu 	 it 	 ous 	 	,	but	that	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	you	see	that	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 un 	 ique 	 	,	 circul 	 ar 	 	form	.
and	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	is	it	's	 expand 	 ing 	 	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	 out 	 ward 	 s 	 	from	that	original	shape	.
and	it	's	one	--	 aga 	 in 	 	,	that	 interconnect 	 ed 	 	root	system	,	making	it	one	 genetic 	 ally 	 	 ident 	 ical 	 	individual	.
it	 al 	 so 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	friend	 near 	 by 	 	--	well	,	i	think	they	're	 friend 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 clon 	 al 	 	mojave	yucca	,	it	's	about	a	mile	away	,	and	it	's	a	little	bit	 old 	 er 	 	than	12,000	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	you	see	it	 ha 	 s 	 	that	similar	 circul 	 ar 	 	form	.
and	there	's	some	 young 	 er 	 	 clone 	 s 	 	 dot 	 ting 	 	the	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	it	.
and	both	of	these	,	the	yucca	and	the	creosote	bush	,	live	on	bureau	of	land	management	land	,	and	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	different	from	 be 	 ing 	 	 protect 	 ed 	 	in	a	national	park	.
in	fact	,	 th 	 is 	 	land	is	 design 	 ated 	 	for	 re 	 creation 	 al 	 	all	-	 terra 	 in 	 	vehicle	use	.
so	,	now	i	want	to	show	what	 ver 	 y 	 	well	might	be	the	 old 	 est 	 	living	thing	on	the	planet	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	siberian	actinobacteria	,	which	is	between	400,000	and	600,000	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
 th 	 is 	 	bacteria	was	 discover 	 ed 	 	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 year 	 s 	 	ago	by	a	team	of	planetary	 biologist 	 s 	 	 hop 	 ing 	 	to	find	 clue 	 s 	 	to	life	on	other	 planet 	 s 	 	by	looking	at	one	of	the	 harsh 	 est 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	on	 our 	 s 	 	.
and	what	they	found	,	by	 do 	 ing 	 	research	 in 	 to 	 	the	 perma 	 frost 	 	,	was	 th 	 is 	 	bacteria	.
but	what	's	 un 	 ique 	 	about	it	is	that	it	's	 do 	 ing 	 	dna	repair	 be 	 low 	 	freezing	.
and	what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	is	that	it	's	not	 dorm 	 ant 	 	--	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	living	and	growing	for	half	a	million	 year 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 prob 	 ably 	 	one	the	most	 vulner 	 able 	 	of	the	 old 	 est 	 	living	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	the	 perma 	 frost 	 	 melt 	 s 	 	,	it	wo	n't	 surviv 	 e 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	map	that	i	've	put	together	of	the	 old 	 est 	 	living	 thing 	 s 	 	,	so	you	can	get	a	sense	of	where	they	are	;	you	see	they	're	all	over	the	world	.
the	blue	 flag 	 s 	 	represent	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	've	 al 	 ready 	 	 photograph 	 ed 	 	,	and	the	 red 	 s 	 	are	 place 	 s 	 	that	i	'm	still	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	to	.
you	'll	see	 al 	 so 	 	,	there	's	a	flag	on	antarctica	.
i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	travel	there	to	find	5,000	year	-	old	moss	,	which	 live 	 s 	 	on	the	antarctic	 pen 	 insula 	 	.
so	,	i	 prob 	 ably 	 	have	about	two	more	 year 	 s 	 	left	on	 th 	 is 	 	project	--	on	 th 	 is 	 	phase	of	the	project	,	but	after	five	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	 re 	 ally 	 	feel	like	i	know	what	's	at	the	heart	of	 th 	 is 	 	work	.
the	 old 	 est 	 	living	 thing 	 s 	 	in	the	world	are	a	record	and	 celebr 	 ation 	 	of	our	past	,	a	call	to	action	in	the	present	and	a	 baro 	 meter 	 	of	our	future	.
they	've	 surviv 	 ed 	 	for	millennia	in	desert	,	in	the	 perma 	 frost 	 	,	at	the	 top 	 s 	 	of	 mountain 	 s 	 	and	at	the	bottom	of	the	ocean	.
they	've	 with 	 stood 	 	 un 	 told 	 	natural	 peril 	 s 	 	and	human	 encroach 	 ments 	 	,	but	now	some	of	them	are	in	 jeopard 	 y 	 	,	and	they	ca	n't	just	get	up	and	get	out	of	the	way	.
it	's	my	hope	that	,	by	going	to	find	these	 organism 	 s 	 	,	that	i	can	help	draw	attention	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	 resili 	 ence 	 	and	help	play	a	part	in	 insur 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 continu 	 ed 	 	 long 	 ev 	 ity 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 foresee 	 able 	 	future	.
thank	you	.
