so	let	's	start	with	sunday	.
i	call	 th 	 is 	 	``	 shin 	 y 	 	tiger	.	``
you	do	not	have	to	 s 	 pend 	 	a	lot	of	money	to	look	great	.
you	can	 al 	 most 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	look	 phenomen 	 al 	 	for	under	$	50	.
 th 	 is 	 	whole	 out 	 fit 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	the	jacket	,	cost	me	$	55	,	and	it	was	the	most	expensive	thing	that	i	 wo 	 re 	 	the	entire	week	.
monday	:	color	is	 power 	 ful 	 	.
it	is	 al 	 most 	 	 physiologic 	 ally 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	to	be	in	a	bad	mood	when	you	're	 wear 	 ing 	 	bright	red	pants	.
if	you	are	happy	,	you	are	going	to	attract	other	happy	people	to	you	.
tuesday	:	fitting	in	is	way	 over 	 rated 	 	.
i	've	 s 	 pent 	 	a	whole	lot	of	my	life	 try 	 ing 	 	to	be	 my 	 self 	 	and	at	the	same	time	fit	in	.
just	be	who	you	are	.	if	you	are	 surround 	 ing 	 	 your 	 self 	 	with	the	right	people	,	they	will	not	 on 	 ly 	 	get	it	,	they	will	appreciate	it	.
wednesday	:	embrace	your	inner	child	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	people	tell	me	that	i	look	like	i	'm	 play 	 ing 	 	dress	-	up	,	or	that	i	 re 	 mind 	 	them	of	 the 	 ir 	 	seven	-	year	-	old	.
i	like	to	 s 	 mile 	 	and	say	,	``	thank	you	.	``	thursday	:	confidence	is	key	.
if	you	think	you	look	good	in	 some 	 thing 	 	,	you	 al 	 most 	 	 certain 	 ly 	 	do	.
and	if	you	do	n't	think	you	look	good	in	 some 	 thing 	 	,	you	're	 al 	 so 	 	 prob 	 ably 	 	right	.
i	grew	up	with	a	mom	who	taught	me	 th 	 is 	 	day	-	in	and	day	-	out	.
but	it	was	n't	 un 	 til 	 	i	 turn 	 ed 	 	30	that	i	 re 	 ally 	 	got	what	 th 	 is 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	.
and	i	'm	going	to	break	it	down	for	you	for	just	a	second	.
if	you	 believ 	 e 	 	you	're	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	person	 in 	 side 	 	and	out	,	there	is	no	look	that	you	ca	n't	pull	off	.
so	there	is	no	excuse	for	any	of	us	here	in	 th 	 is 	 	audience	.
we	should	be	able	to	rock	 any 	 thing 	 	we	want	to	rock	.
thank	you	.
friday	:	a	universal	truth	--	five	 word 	 s 	 	for	you	:	gold	sequins	go	with	 every 	 thing 	 	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	saturday	:	 develop 	 ing 	 	your	own	 un 	 ique 	 	personal	style	is	a	 re 	 ally 	 	great	way	to	tell	the	world	 some 	 thing 	 	about	you	 with 	 out 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	say	a	word	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	proven	to	me	time	and	time	 aga 	 in 	 	 a 	 s 	 	people	have	 walk 	 ed 	 	up	to	me	 th 	 is 	 	week	 simpl 	 y 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	what	i	'm	 wear 	 ing 	 	,
and	we	've	had	great	 conversation 	 s 	 	.
so	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	all	going	to	fit	back	in	my	 tin 	 y 	 	 suit 	 case 	 	.
so	before	i	go	home	to	brooklyn	,	i	'm	going	to	 don 	 ate 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	back	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	 less 	 on 	 	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	learn	 my 	 self 	 	 th 	 is 	 	week	is	that	it	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	to	let	go	.
i	do	n't	need	to	get	 emotion 	 ally 	 	 attach 	 ed 	 	to	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	around	the	corner	,	there	is	 al 	 ways 	 	going	to	be	 an 	 other 	 	crazy	,	 color 	 ful 	 	,	 shin 	 y 	 	 out 	 fit 	 	just	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	me	,	if	i	put	a	little	love	in	my	heart	and	look	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
thank	you	.
