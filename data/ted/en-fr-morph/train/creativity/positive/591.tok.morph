last	year	at	ted	we	 aim 	 ed 	 	to	try	to	 clar 	 ify 	 	the	 overwhelm 	 ing 	 	 complex 	 ity 	 	and	 rich 	 ness 	 	that	we	experience	at	the	 con 	 ference 	 	in	a	project	 call 	 ed 	 	big	viz	.
and	the	big	viz	is	a	 collect 	 ion 	 	of	650	 sketch 	 es 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	made	by	two	visual	 artist 	 s 	 	.
david	sibbet	from	the	grove	,	and	kevin	richards	,	from	autodesk	,	made	650	 sketch 	 es 	 	that	 striv 	 e 	 	to	capture	the	 es 	 s 	 ence 	 	of	each	 present 	 er 	 	's	 idea 	 s 	 	.
and	the	 con 	 sens 	 us 	 	was	:	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	.
these	 sketch 	 es 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	to	life	the	key	 idea 	 s 	 	,	the	 portrait 	 s 	 	,	the	magic	 moment 	 s 	 	that	we	all	 experience 	 d 	 	last	year	.
 th 	 is 	 	year	we	 we 	 re 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	why	 do 	 es 	 	it	work	?	``
what	is	it	about	 anim 	 ation 	 	,	 graphic 	 s 	 	,	 illustr 	 ations 	 	,	that	create	meaning	?
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 import 	 ant 	 	question	to	ask	and	answer
 be 	 cause 	 	the	more	we	understand	how	the	brain	 create 	 s 	 	meaning	,	the	better	we	can	communicate	,
and	,	i	 al 	 so 	 	think	,	the	better	we	can	think	and	 collabor 	 ate 	 	together	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	year	we	're	going	to	 visual 	 ize 	 	how	the	brain	 visual 	 ize 	 s 	 	.
cognitive	 psycho 	 logists 	 	now	tell	us	that	the	brain	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	the	world	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	,	but	 in 	 stead 	 	,	 create 	 s 	 	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	mental	 model 	 s 	 	through	a	 collect 	 ion 	 	of	``	ah	-	ha	 moment 	 s 	 	,	``	or	 moment 	 s 	 	of	 discover 	 y 	 	,	through	 vari 	 ous 	 	 process 	 es 	 	.
the	 process 	 ing 	 	,	of	course	,	 begin 	 s 	 	with	the	 eye 	 s 	 	.
light	 enter 	 s 	 	,	 hit 	 s 	 	the	back	of	the	retina	,	and	is	 circul 	 ated 	 	,	most	of	which	is	 stream 	 ed 	 	to	the	 ver 	 y 	 	back	of	the	brain	,	at	the	 prim 	 ary 	 	visual	cortex	.
and	 prim 	 ary 	 	visual	cortex	 s 	 ees 	 	just	simple	 geo 	 metry 	 	,	just	the	 simpl 	 est 	 	of	 shape 	 s 	 	.
but	it	 al 	 so 	 	 act 	 s 	 	like	a	kind	of	 re 	 lay 	 	station	that	re	-	 radiate 	 s 	 	and	 re 	 direct 	 s 	 	information	to	 man 	 y 	 	other	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	brain	.
 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 a 	 s 	 	30	other	 part 	 s 	 	that	 select 	 ively 	 	make	more	sense	,	create	more	meaning	through	the	kind	of	``	ah	-	ha	``	 experience 	 s 	 	.
we	're	 on 	 ly 	 	going	to	talk	about	three	of	them	.
so	the	first	one	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 vent 	 ral 	 	stream	.
it	's	on	 th 	 is 	 	side	of	the	brain	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	part	of	the	brain	that	will	 recogn 	 ize 	 	what	 some 	 thing 	 	is	.
it	's	the	``	what	``	 detect 	 or 	 	.
look	at	a	hand	.	look	at	a	remote	control	.	chair	.	book	.
so	that	's	the	part	of	the	brain	that	is	 activate 	 d 	 	when	you	give	a	word	to	 some 	 thing 	 	.
a	second	part	of	the	brain	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 dor 	 s 	 al 	 	stream	.
and	what	it	 do 	 es 	 	is	 locate 	 s 	 	the	object	in	physical	body	space	.
so	if	you	look	around	the	stage	here	you	'll	create	a	kind	of	mental	map	of	the	stage	.
and	if	you	closed	your	 eye 	 s 	 	you	'd	be	able	to	 ment 	 ally 	 	 navig 	 ate 	 	it	.
you	'd	be	 activ 	 ating 	 	the	 dor 	 s 	 al 	 	stream	if	you	did	that	.
the	third	part	that	i	'd	like	to	talk	about	is	the	 limb 	 ic 	 	system	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	deep	 in 	 side 	 	of	the	brain	.	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	old	,	 evolution 	 arily 	 	.
and	it	's	the	part	that	 feel 	 s 	 	.
it	's	the	kind	of	gut	center	,	where	you	see	an	image	and	you	go	,	``	oh	!	i	have	a	strong	or	 emotion 	 al 	 	 re 	 action 	 	to	 what 	 ever 	 	i	'm	 see 	 ing 	 	.	``
so	the	combination	of	these	 process 	 ing 	 	 center 	 s 	 	help	us	make	meaning	in	 ver 	 y 	 	different	ways	.
so	what	can	we	learn	about	 th 	 is 	 	?	how	can	we	 app 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 sight 	 	?
well	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	schematic	view	is	that	the	eye	 visual 	 ly 	 	 interrog 	 ates 	 	what	we	look	at	.
the	brain	 process 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	parallel	,	the	 fig 	 ments 	 	of	information	 ask 	 ing 	 	a	whole	bunch	of	 question 	 s 	 	to	create	a	 un 	 ified 	 	mental	model	.
so	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	when	you	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	image	a	good	graphic	 invit 	 es 	 	the	eye	to	 d 	 art 	 	around	,	to	 select 	 ively 	 	create	a	visual	logic	.
so	the	act	of	 engag 	 ing 	 	,	and	looking	at	the	image	 create 	 s 	 	the	meaning	.
it	's	the	 select 	 ive 	 	logic	.
now	we	've	 augment 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	and	 spatial 	 ized 	 	 th 	 is 	 	information	.
 man 	 y 	 	of	you	may	remember	the	magic	wall	that	we	built	in	 con 	 junction 	 	with	perceptive	pixel	where	we	 quit 	 e 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	create	an	infinite	wall	.
and	so	we	can	 compar 	 e 	 	and	contrast	the	big	 idea 	 s 	 	.
so	the	act	of	 engag 	 ing 	 	and	creating	 inter 	 active 	 	 image 	 ry 	 	 enrich 	 es 	 	meaning	.
it	 activate 	 s 	 	a	different	part	of	the	brain	.
and	then	the	 limb 	 ic 	 	system	is	 activate 	 d 	 	when	we	see	motion	,	when	we	see	color	,	and	there	are	 prim 	 ary 	 	 shape 	 s 	 	and	pattern	 detect 	 ors 	 	that	we	've	heard	about	before	.
so	the	point	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	?
we	make	meaning	by	 see 	 ing 	 	,	by	an	act	of	visual	 interrog 	 ation 	 	.
the	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	for	us	are	three	-	fold	.
first	,	use	 image 	 s 	 	to	 clar 	 ify 	 	what	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	communicate	.
 second 	 ly 	 	make	 t 	 hose 	 	 image 	 s 	 	 inter 	 active 	 	so	that	we	engage	much	more	fully	.
and	the	third	is	to	augment	 memor 	 y 	 	by	creating	a	visual	 persist 	 ence 	 	.
these	are	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	that	can	be	used	to	be	--	that	can	be	 appli 	 ed 	 	in	a	wide	range	of	problem	solving	.
so	the	low	-	tech	version	 look 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	,	by	the	way	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	way	in	which	we	develop	and	 form 	 ulate 	 	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	 with 	 in 	 	autodesk	,	in	some	of	our	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	and	some	of	our	 division 	 s 	 	.
what	we	 liter 	 ally 	 	do	is	have	the	 team 	 s 	 	draw	out	the	entire	 strat 	 egic 	 	plan	on	one	giant	wall	.
and	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 every 	 one 	 	 get 	 s 	 	to	see	 every 	 thing 	 	else	.
there	's	 al 	 ways 	 	a	room	,	 al 	 ways 	 	a	place	to	be	able	to	make	sense	of	all	of	the	 component 	 s 	 	in	the	 strat 	 egic 	 	plan	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	time	-	lapse	view	of	it	.
you	can	ask	the	question	,	``	who	's	the	 bo 	 s 	 s 	 	?	``
you	'll	be	able	to	figure	that	out	.
so	the	act	of	 collect 	 ively 	 	and	 collabor 	 ative 	 ly 	 	building	the	image	 transform 	 s 	 	the	 collabor 	 ation 	 	.
no	powerpoint	is	used	in	two	 day 	 s 	 	.
but	 in 	 stead 	 	the	entire	team	 create 	 s 	 	a	 share 	 d 	 	mental	model	that	they	can	all	agree	on	and	move	forward	on	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	can	be	 enhance 	 d 	 	and	 augment 	 ed 	 	with	some	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	digital	technology	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	our	great	 unveil 	 ing 	 	for	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	set	of	 techno 	 logies 	 	that	use	large	-	screen	 dis 	 play 	 s 	 	with	intelligent	 calcul 	 ation 	 	in	the	 back 	 ground 	 	to	make	the	 in 	 visible 	 	visible	.
here	what	we	can	do	is	look	at	 sustain 	 ability 	 	,	 quit 	 e 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	.
so	a	team	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	look	at	all	the	key	 component 	 s 	 	that	heat	the	structure	and	make	 choice 	 s 	 	and	then	see	the	end	result	that	is	 visual 	 ized 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	screen	.
so	making	 image 	 s 	 	 meaning 	 ful 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	three	 component 	 s 	 	.	the	first	 aga 	 in 	 	,	is	making	 idea 	 s 	 	clear	by	 visual 	 izing 	 	them	.
 second 	 ly 	 	,	making	them	 inter 	 active 	 	.
and	then	 third 	 ly 	 	,	making	them	 persist 	 ent 	 	.
and	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	these	three	 principle 	 s 	 	can	be	 appli 	 ed 	 	to	solving	some	of	the	 ver 	 y 	 	tough	 problem 	 s 	 	that	we	face	in	the	world	 to 	 day 	 	.	 thank 	 s 	 	so	much	.
