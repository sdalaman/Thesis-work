space	,	we	all	know	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 surround 	 ed 	 	by	 image 	 s 	 	of	space	our	whole	 live 	 s 	 	,	from	the	 specul 	 ative 	 	 image 	 s 	 	of	science	fiction	to	the	 inspiration 	 al 	 	 vision 	 s 	 	of	 artist 	 s 	 	to	the	 increasing 	 ly 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	made	possible	by	complex	 techno 	 logies 	 	.
but	whilst	we	have	an	 overwhelm 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 vivi 	 d 	 	visual	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	space	,	we	have	no	sense	of	what	space	 sound 	 s 	 	like	.
and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	most	people	associate	space	with	silence	.
but	the	story	of	how	we	came	to	understand	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	just	 a 	 s 	 	much	a	story	of	 listen 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	by	looking	.
and	yet	 de 	 spite 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	 hard 	 ly 	 	any	of	us	have	ever	heard	space	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	here	could	 de 	 scribe 	 	the	sound	of	a	single	planet	or	star	?
well	in	case	you	've	ever	 wonder 	 ed 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	the	 s 	 un 	 	 sound 	 s 	 	like	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	planet	jupiter	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	space	 prob 	 e 	 	cassini	 pirouett 	 ing 	 	through	the	ice	 ring 	 s 	 	of	saturn	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	a	 high 	 ly 	 	 condens 	 ed 	 	 c 	 lump 	 	of	neutral	matter	,	 s 	 pinning 	 	in	the	 di 	 stant 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
so	my	 art 	 istic 	 	practice	is	all	about	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	the	weird	and	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 noise 	 s 	 	 emit 	 ted 	 	by	the	 magnific 	 ent 	 	 ce 	 les 	 tial 	 	 object 	 s 	 	that	make	up	our	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
and	you	may	wonder	,	how	do	we	know	what	these	 sound 	 s 	 	are	?
how	can	we	tell	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	the	sound	of	the	 s 	 un 	 	and	the	sound	of	a	 puls 	 ar 	 	?
well	the	answer	is	the	science	of	radio	 astro 	 nomy 	 	.
radio	 astronomer 	 s 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	radio	 wave 	 s 	 	from	space	using	sensitive	 antenna 	 s 	 	and	 receiv 	 ers 	 	,	which	give	them	precise	information	about	what	an	astronomical	object	is	and	where	it	is	in	our	night	sky	.
and	just	like	the	 signal 	 s 	 	that	we	 s 	 end 	 	and	 receiv 	 e 	 	here	on	earth	,	we	can	convert	these	 trans 	 mission 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	sound	using	simple	analog	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	.
and	 there 	 fore 	 	,	it	's	through	 listen 	 ing 	 	that	we	've	come	to	 un 	 cover 	 	some	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	's	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 secret 	 s 	 	--	 it 	 s 	 	scale	,	what	it	's	made	of	and	even	how	old	it	is	.
so	 to 	 day 	 	,	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	a	short	story	of	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	through	 listen 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	 punctu 	 ated 	 	by	three	quick	 anecdote 	 s 	 	,	which	show	how	 accident 	 al 	 	 en 	 counter 	 s 	 	with	strange	 noise 	 s 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	us	some	of	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	information	we	have	about	space	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	story	 do 	 es 	 	n't	start	with	vast	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	or	 futurist 	 ic 	 	 space 	 craft 	 	,	but	a	 ra 	 ther 	 	more	humble	technology	--	and	in	fact	,	the	 ver 	 y 	 	medium	which	 g 	 ave 	 	us	the	 tele 	 communication 	 s 	 	revolution	that	we	're	all	part	of	 to 	 day 	 	:	the	 tele 	 phone 	 	.
it	's	1876	,	it	's	in	boston	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	alexander	graham	bell	who	was	 work 	 ing 	 	with	thomas	watson	on	the	 invent 	 ion 	 	of	the	 tele 	 phone 	 	.
a	key	part	of	 the 	 ir 	 	technical	set	up	was	a	half	-	mile	long	length	of	wire	,	which	was	 throw 	 n 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 roof 	 top 	 s 	 	of	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 house 	 s 	 	in	boston	.
the	line	carried	the	 tele 	 phone 	 	 signal 	 s 	 	that	would	 lat 	 er 	 	make	bell	a	 house 	 hold 	 	name	.
but	like	any	long	length	of	charged	wire	,	it	 al 	 so 	 	 in 	 advert 	 ent 	 ly 	 	 be 	 came 	 	an	antenna	.
thomas	watson	 s 	 pent 	 	 hour 	 s 	 	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	the	strange	 crack 	 les 	 	and	 his 	 s 	 es 	 	and	 chirp 	 s 	 	and	 whistl 	 es 	 	that	his	 accident 	 al 	 	antenna	 detect 	 ed 	 	.
now	you	have	to	remember	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	10	 year 	 s 	 	before	heinrich	hertz	 prov 	 ed 	 	the	 exist 	 ence 	 	of	radio	 wave 	 s 	 	--	15	 year 	 s 	 	before	nikola	tesla	's	four	-	tuned	circuit	--	 near 	 ly 	 	20	 year 	 s 	 	before	marconi	's	first	 broad 	 cast 	 	.
so	thomas	watson	was	n't	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	us	.
we	did	n't	have	the	technology	to	transmit	.
so	what	 we 	 re 	 	these	strange	 noise 	 s 	 	?
watson	was	in	fact	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	 ver 	 y 	 	low	-	frequency	radio	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	 caus 	 ed 	 	by	nature	.
some	of	the	 crack 	 les 	 	and	 pop 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 light 	 ning 	 	,	but	the	 eer 	 ie 	 	 whistl 	 es 	 	and	 cur 	 iously 	 	 melo 	 d 	 ious 	 	 chirp 	 s 	 	had	a	 ra 	 ther 	 	more	 ex 	 otic 	 	origin	.
using	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	 tele 	 phone 	 	,	watson	was	in	fact	 dial 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 heaven 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	he	 correct 	 ly 	 	 guess 	 ed 	 	,	some	of	these	 sound 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 caus 	 ed 	 	by	activity	on	the	surface	of	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
it	was	a	solar	wind	 interact 	 ing 	 	with	our	 ion 	 o 	 sphere 	 	that	he	was	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	--	a	 phenomen 	 a 	 	which	we	can	see	at	the	 extrem 	 e 	 	 north 	 ern 	 	and	southern	 latitude 	 s 	 	of	our	planet	 a 	 s 	 	the	aurora	.
so	whilst	 invent 	 ing 	 	the	technology	that	would	 us 	 her 	 	in	the	 tele 	 communication 	 s 	 	revolution	,	watson	had	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	the	star	at	the	center	of	our	solar	system	 emit 	 ted 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	radio	 wave 	 s 	 	.
he	had	 accident 	 ally 	 	 be 	 en 	 	the	first	person	to	tune	in	to	them	.
fast	-	forward	50	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	bell	and	watson	's	technology	 ha 	 s 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	 transform 	 ed 	 	global	 communication 	 s 	 	.
but	going	from	 s 	 ling 	 ing 	 	some	wire	 a 	 cross 	 	 roof 	 top 	 s 	 	in	boston	to	 lay 	 ing 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	and	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 mile 	 s 	 	of	cable	on	the	atlantic	ocean	 sea 	 bed 	 	is	no	easy	matter	.
and	so	before	long	,	bell	 we 	 re 	 	looking	to	new	 techno 	 logies 	 	to	optimize	 the 	 ir 	 	revolution	.
radio	could	carry	sound	 with 	 out 	 	 wire 	 s 	 	.
but	the	medium	is	 loss 	 y 	 	--	it	's	subject	to	a	lot	of	noise	and	 inter 	 ference 	 	.
so	bell	 employ 	 ed 	 	an	engineer	to	 stud 	 y 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 noise 	 s 	 	,	to	try	and	find	out	where	they	came	from	,	with	a	view	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	building	the	perfect	 hard 	 ware 	 	 co 	 dec 	 	,	which	would	get	rid	of	them	so	they	could	think	about	using	radio	for	the	 purpose 	 s 	 	of	 tele 	 phony 	 	.
most	of	the	 noise 	 s 	 	that	the	engineer	,	karl	jansky	,	 investigate 	 d 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 fair 	 ly 	 	prosaic	in	origin	.
they	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	 light 	 ning 	 	or	 source 	 s 	 	of	 electric 	 al 	 	power	.
but	there	was	one	 persist 	 ent 	 	noise	that	jansky	could	n't	identify	,	and	it	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	appear	in	his	radio	 head 	 set 	 	four	 minute 	 s 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	each	day	.
now	any	astronomer	will	tell	you	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 tell 	 tale 	 	sign	of	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 origin 	 ate 	 	from	earth	.
jansky	had	made	a	historic	 discover 	 y 	 	,	that	 ce 	 les 	 tial 	 	 object 	 s 	 	could	emit	radio	 wave 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	light	 wave 	 s 	 	.
fifty	 year 	 s 	 	on	from	watson	's	 accident 	 al 	 	 en 	 counter 	 	with	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	jansky	's	 care 	 ful 	 	 listen 	 ing 	 	 us 	 her 	 ed 	 	in	a	new	age	of	space	exploration	:	the	radio	 astro 	 nomy 	 	age	.
over	the	next	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	 astronomer 	 s 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	up	 the 	 ir 	 	 antenna 	 s 	 	to	 loud 	 speaker 	 s 	 	and	 learn 	 ed 	 	about	our	radio	sky	,	about	jupiter	and	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	by	 listen 	 ing 	 	.
let	's	jump	 a 	 head 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
it	's	1964	,	and	we	're	back	at	bell	 lab 	 s 	 	.	and	once	 aga 	 in 	 	,	two	 scientist 	 s 	 	have	got	a	problem	with	noise	.
arno	penzias	and	robert	wilson	 we 	 re 	 	using	the	horn	antenna	at	bell	's	holmdel	 labor 	 atory 	 	to	 stud 	 y 	 	the	 milk 	 y 	 	way	with	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 pre 	 cis 	 ion 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	the	 galax 	 y 	 	in	high	fidelity	.
there	was	a	 gl 	 itch 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 sound 	 track 	 	.
a	 myster 	 ious 	 	 persist 	 ent 	 	noise	was	 disrupt 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	research	.
it	was	in	the	 micro 	 wave 	 	range	,	and	it	 appear 	 ed 	 	to	be	coming	from	all	 direction 	 s 	 	 simultaneous 	 ly 	 	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	did	n't	make	any	sense	,
and	like	any	 reason 	 able 	 	engineer	or	scientist	,	they	 assum 	 ed 	 	that	the	problem	must	be	the	technology	 it 	 self 	 	,	it	must	be	the	dish	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	 pigeon 	 s 	 	 roo 	 s 	 ting 	 	in	the	dish	.
and	so	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	once	they	 clean 	 ed 	 	up	the	pigeon	 dropping 	 s 	 	,	get	the	 dis 	 k 	 	kind	of	 operation 	 al 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	,	normal	 operation 	 s 	 	would	resume	.
but	the	noise	did	n't	disappear	.
the	 myster 	 ious 	 	noise	that	penzias	and	wilson	 we 	 re 	 	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	the	 old 	 est 	 	and	most	significant	sound	that	 any 	 one 	 	had	ever	heard	.
it	was	 cosm 	 ic 	 	 radi 	 ation 	 	left	over	from	the	 ver 	 y 	 	birth	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	the	first	 experiment 	 al 	 	evidence	that	the	big	bang	 exist 	 ed 	 	and	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	was	born	at	a	precise	moment	some	14.7	billion	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
so	our	story	 end 	 s 	 	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	--	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	all	 thing 	 s 	 	,	the	big	bang	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	noise	that	penzias	and	wilson	heard	--	the	 old 	 est 	 	sound	that	you	're	ever	going	to	hear	,	the	 cosm 	 ic 	 	 micro 	 wave 	 	 back 	 ground 	 	 radi 	 ation 	 	left	over	from	the	big	bang	.
