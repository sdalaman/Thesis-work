i	'm	going	to	go	right	 in 	 to 	 	the	 slide 	 s 	 	.
and	all	i	'm	going	to	try	and	prove	to	you	with	these	 slide 	 s 	 	is	that	i	do	just	 ver 	 y 	 	straight	stuff	.
and	my	 idea 	 s 	 	are	--	in	my	head	,	 any 	 way 	 	--	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	logical	and	 re 	 late 	 	to	what	's	going	on	and	problem	solving	for	 client 	 s 	 	.
i	either	 con 	 vince 	 	 client 	 s 	 	at	the	end	that	i	solve	 the 	 ir 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	,	or	i	 re 	 ally 	 	do	solve	 the 	 ir 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 usual 	 ly 	 	they	seem	to	like	it	.
let	me	go	right	 in 	 to 	 	the	 slide 	 s 	 	.
can	you	turn	off	the	light	?	down	.
i	like	to	be	in	the	dark	.
i	do	n't	want	you	to	see	what	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	up	here	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	i	did	 th 	 is 	 	house	in	santa	monica	,	and	it	got	a	lot	of	 no 	 to 	 riet 	 y 	 	.
in	fact	,	it	 appear 	 ed 	 	in	a	porno	 com 	 ic 	 	book	,	which	is	the	slide	on	the	right	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	in	venice	.
i	just	show	it	 be 	 cause 	 	i	want	you	to	know	i	'm	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	 con 	 text 	 	.
on	the	left	-	hand	side	,	i	had	the	 con 	 text 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	little	 house 	 s 	 	,	and	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	build	a	building	that	fit	 in 	 to 	 	that	 con 	 text 	 	.
when	people	take	 picture 	 s 	 	of	these	 building 	 s 	 	out	of	that	 con 	 text 	 	they	look	 re 	 ally 	 	weird	,	and	my	 pre 	 mise 	 	is	that	they	make	a	lot	more	sense	when	they	're	 photograph 	 ed 	 	or	 s 	 een 	 	in	that	space	.
and	then	,	once	i	deal	with	the	 con 	 text 	 	,	i	then	try	to	make	a	place	that	's	 comfort 	 able 	 	and	private	and	 fair 	 ly 	 	 s 	 er 	 ene 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	hope	you	'll	find	that	slide	on	the	right	.
and	then	i	did	a	law	school	for	loyola	in	 down 	 town 	 	l.a	.
i	was	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	making	a	place	for	the	 stud 	 y 	 	of	law	.
and	we	 continu 	 e 	 	to	work	with	 th 	 is 	 	client	.
the	building	on	the	right	at	the	top	is	now	under	construction	.
the	 gar 	 age 	 	on	the	right	--	the	gray	structure	--	will	be	torn	down	,	 final 	 ly 	 	,	and	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	small	 class 	 rooms 	 	will	be	 place 	 d 	 	 a 	 long 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 venue 	 	that	we	've	 create 	 d 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	campus	.
and	it	all	related	to	the	 client 	 s 	 	and	the	 student 	 s 	 	from	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	 meet 	 ing 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	they	felt	 deni 	 ed 	 	a	place	.
they	 want 	 ed 	 	a	sense	of	place	.
and	so	the	whole	idea	here	was	to	create	that	kind	of	space	in	 down 	 town 	 	,	in	a	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	that	was	difficult	to	fit	 in 	 to 	 	.
and	it	was	my	 theor 	 y 	 	,	or	my	point	of	view	,	that	one	did	n't	upstage	the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	--	one	made	accommodations	.
i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	be	inclusive	,	to	include	the	 building 	 s 	 	in	the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 building 	 s 	 	i	 like 	 d 	 	or	not	.
in	the	'60s	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	with	paper	furniture	and	made	a	bunch	of	stuff	that	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	in	bloomingdale	's	.
we	even	made	 floor 	 ing 	 	,	 wall 	 s 	 	and	 every 	 thing 	 	,	out	of	 card 	 board 	 	.
and	the	success	of	it	threw	me	for	a	loop	.
i	could	n't	deal	with	the	success	of	furniture	--	i	was	n't	secure	 en 	 ough 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	architect	--	and	so	i	closed	it	all	up	and	made	furniture	that	 no 	 body 	 	would	like	.
so	,	 no 	 body 	 	would	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	it	was	in	 th 	 is 	 	,	 pre 	 liminary 	 	to	these	 piece 	 s 	 	of	furniture	,	that	ricky	and	i	 work 	 ed 	 	on	furniture	by	the	slice	.
and	after	we	 fail 	 ed 	 	,	i	just	 ke 	 pt 	 	 fail 	 ing 	 	.
the	piece	on	the	left	--	and	that	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	led	to	the	piece	on	the	right	--	 happen 	 ed 	 	when	the	kid	that	was	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	took	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	long	 string 	 s 	 	of	stuff	and	 fold 	 ed 	 	it	up	to	put	it	in	the	 waste 	 basket 	 	.
and	i	put	a	piece	of	tape	around	it	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	see	there	,	and	 real 	 ized 	 	you	could	 s 	 it 	 	on	it	,	and	it	had	a	lot	of	 resili 	 ence 	 	and	strength	and	so	on	.
so	,	it	was	an	 accident 	 al 	 	 discover 	 y 	 	.
i	got	 in 	 to 	 	fish	.
i	mean	,	the	story	i	tell	is	that	i	got	mad	at	postmodernism	--	at	po	-	mo	--	and	 s 	 aid 	 	that	fish	 we 	 re 	 	500	million	 year 	 s 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	than	man	,	and	if	you	're	going	to	go	back	,	we	might	 a 	 s 	 	well	go	back	to	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
and	so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	making	these	funny	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	they	 start 	 ed 	 	to	have	a	life	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	and	got	 big 	 ger 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	the	one	glass	at	the	 walk 	 er 	 	.
and	then	,	i	 slice 	 d 	 	off	the	head	and	the	tail	and	 every 	 thing 	 	and	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	 transl 	 ate 	 	what	i	was	 learn 	 ing 	 	about	the	form	of	the	fish	and	the	 move 	 ment 	 	.
and	a	lot	of	my	 architect 	 ural 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	that	came	from	it	--	 accident 	 al 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	--	it	was	an	intuitive	kind	of	thing	,	and	i	just	 ke 	 pt 	 	going	with	it	,	and	made	 th 	 is 	 	proposal	for	a	building	,	which	was	 on 	 ly 	 	a	proposal	.
i	did	 th 	 is 	 	building	in	japan	.
i	was	taken	out	to	 d 	 inner 	 	after	the	contract	for	 th 	 is 	 	little	restaurant	was	 sign 	 ed 	 	.
and	i	love	sake	and	kobe	and	all	that	stuff	.
and	after	i	got	--	i	was	 re 	 ally 	 	drunk	--	i	was	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	do	some	 sketch 	 es 	 	on	 napkin 	 s 	 	.
and	i	made	some	 sketch 	 es 	 	on	 napkin 	 s 	 	--	little	boxes	and	morandi	-	like	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	used	to	do	.
and	the	client	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	why	no	fish	?	``
and	so	i	made	a	 draw 	 ing 	 	with	a	fish	,	and	i	left	japan	.
three	 week 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	i	 receiv 	 ed 	 	a	complete	set	of	 draw 	 ing 	 s 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	we	'd	won	the	 com 	 petition 	 	.
now	,	it	's	hard	to	do	.	it	's	hard	to	 transl 	 ate 	 	a	fish	form	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	so	 beaut 	 iful 	 	--	perfect	--	 in 	 to 	 	a	building	or	object	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	oldenburg	,	who	i	work	with	a	little	once	in	a	while	,	told	me	i	could	n't	do	it	,	and	so	that	made	it	even	more	 excit 	 ing 	 	.
but	he	was	right	--	i	could	n't	do	the	tail	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	get	the	head	ok	,	but	the	tail	i	could	n't	do	.
it	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	hard	.
the	thing	on	the	right	is	a	snake	form	,	a	ziggurat	.
and	i	put	them	together	,	and	you	walk	between	them	.
it	was	a	 dia 	 log 	 	with	the	 con 	 text 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
now	,	if	you	saw	a	picture	of	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	was	 publish 	 ed 	 	in	 architect 	 ural 	 	record	--	they	did	n't	show	the	 con 	 text 	 	,	so	you	would	think	,	``	god	,	what	a	pushy	guy	 th 	 is 	 	is	.	``
but	a	friend	of	mine	 s 	 pent 	 	four	 hour 	 s 	 	 wander 	 ing 	 	around	here	looking	for	 th 	 is 	 	restaurant	.
could	n't	find	it	.
so	...	 a 	 s 	 	for	craft	and	technology	and	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	've	all	 be 	 en 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	,	i	was	 throw 	 n 	 	for	a	complete	loop	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	built	in	six	 month 	 s 	 	.
the	way	we	 s 	 ent 	 	 draw 	 ing 	 s 	 	to	japan	:	we	used	the	magic	computer	in	michigan	that	 do 	 es 	 	 carv 	 ed 	 	 model 	 s 	 	,
and	we	used	to	make	foam	 model 	 s 	 	,	which	that	thing	 s 	 can 	 ned 	 	.
we	made	the	 draw 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	the	fish	and	the	 scale 	 s 	 	.
and	when	i	got	there	,	 every 	 thing 	 	was	perfect	--	 ex 	 cept 	 	the	tail	.
so	,	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	cut	off	the	head	and	the	tail	.
and	i	made	the	object	on	the	left	for	my	show	at	the	 walk 	 er 	 	.
and	it	's	one	of	the	 nic 	 est 	 	 piece 	 s 	 	i	've	ever	made	,	i	think	.
and	then	jay	chiat	,	a	friend	and	client	,	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	to	do	his	 head 	 quarter 	 s 	 	building	in	l.a	.
for	 reason 	 s 	 	we	do	n't	want	to	talk	about	,	it	got	 delay 	 ed 	 	.
toxic	waste	,	i	guess	,	is	the	key	clue	to	that	one	.
and	so	we	built	a	 tempor 	 ary 	 	building	--	i	'm	 get 	 ting 	 	good	at	 tempor 	 ary 	 	--	and	we	put	a	 con 	 ference 	 	room	in	that	's	a	fish	.
and	,	 final 	 ly 	 	,	jay	 drag 	 ged 	 	me	to	my	 home 	 town 	 	,	toronto	,	canada	.
and	there	is	a	story	--	it	's	a	real	story	--	about	my	 grand 	 mother 	 	 buy 	 ing 	 	a	carp	on	thursday	,	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	it	home	,	 put 	 ting 	 	it	in	the	 bath 	 tub 	 	when	i	was	a	kid	.
i	 play 	 ed 	 	with	it	in	the	 even 	 ing 	 	.
when	i	went	to	sleep	,	the	next	day	it	was	n't	there	.
and	the	next	night	,	we	had	gefilte	fish	.
and	so	i	set	up	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 terior 	 	for	jay	's	 off 	 ice 	 s 	 	and	i	made	a	pedestal	for	a	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	.
and	he	did	n't	buy	a	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	,	so	i	made	one	.
i	went	around	toronto	and	found	a	 bath 	 tub 	 	like	my	 grand 	 mother 	 	's	,	and	i	put	the	fish	in	.
it	was	a	joke	.
i	play	with	funny	people	like	[	claes	]	oldenburg	.
we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	for	a	long	time	.
and	we	've	 start 	 ed 	 	to	work	on	 thing 	 s 	 	.
a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	we	did	a	performance	piece	in	venice	,	italy	,	 call 	 ed 	 	``	il	corso	del	coltello	``	--	the	swiss	 arm 	 y 	 	knife	.
and	most	of	the	 image 	 ry 	 	is	--	claes	'	,	but	 t 	 hose 	 	two	little	 boy 	 s 	 	are	my	 son 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	claes	'	 assist 	 ants 	 	in	the	play	.
he	was	the	swiss	 arm 	 y 	 	knife	.
he	was	a	souvenir	 sale 	 s 	 man 	 	who	 al 	 ways 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	a	 paint 	 er 	 	,	and	i	was	frankie	p.	toronto	.
p	for	palladio	.
 dress 	 ed 	 	up	like	the	at	&	t	building	by	claes	--	with	a	fish	hat	.
the	 high 	 light 	 	of	the	performance	was	at	the	end	.
 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	object	,	the	swiss	 arm 	 y 	 	knife	,	which	i	get	credit	for	 particip 	 ating 	 	in	.
and	i	can	tell	you	--	it	's	 total 	 ly 	 	an	oldenburg	.
i	had	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	it	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	i	did	was	,	i	made	it	possible	for	them	to	turn	 t 	 hose 	 	 blade 	 s 	 	so	you	could	sail	 th 	 is 	 	thing	in	the	 can 	 al 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	love	 s 	 ailing 	 	.
we	made	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	 s 	 ailing 	 	craft	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	known	to	mess	with	 thing 	 s 	 	like	chain	link	 f 	 encing 	 	.
i	do	it	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	a	 cur 	 ious 	 	thing	in	the	culture	,	when	 thing 	 s 	 	are	made	in	 s 	 uch 	 	great	 quant 	 ities 	 	,	 absorb 	 ed 	 	in	 s 	 uch 	 	great	 quant 	 ities 	 	,	and	there	's	so	much	 deni 	 al 	 	about	them	.
people	hate	it	.
and	i	'm	 fascinate 	 d 	 	with	that	,	which	,	like	the	paper	furniture	--	it	's	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 material 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'm	 al 	 ways 	 	drawn	to	that	.
and	so	i	did	a	lot	of	 dirt 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	with	chain	link	,	which	 no 	 body 	 	will	forgive	me	for	.
but	claes	made	 hom 	 age 	 	to	it	in	the	loyola	law	school	.
and	that	chain	link	is	 re 	 ally 	 	expensive	.
it	's	in	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	and	 every 	 thing 	 	.
and	then	we	did	a	camp	together	for	children	with	cancer	.
and	you	can	see	,	we	 start 	 ed 	 	making	a	building	together	.
of	course	,	the	milk	can	is	his	.
but	we	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	collide	our	 idea 	 s 	 	,	to	put	 object 	 s 	 	next	to	each	other	.
like	a	morandi	--	like	the	little	 bottle 	 s 	 	--	 com 	 posing 	 	them	like	a	still	life	.
and	it	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	work	 a 	 s 	 	a	way	to	put	he	and	i	together	.
then	jay	chiat	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	building	on	 th 	 is 	 	funny	lot	in	venice	,	and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	three	-	piece	thing	,	and	you	 enter 	 ed 	 	in	the	middle	.
and	jay	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	what	i	was	going	to	do	with	the	piece	in	the	middle	.
and	he	 push 	 ed 	 	that	.
and	one	day	i	had	a	--	oh	,	well	,	the	other	way	.
i	had	the	 bin 	 ocular 	 s 	 	from	claes	,	and	i	put	them	there	,	and	i	could	never	get	rid	of	them	after	that	.
oldenburg	made	the	 bin 	 ocular 	 s 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	when	he	 s 	 ent 	 	me	the	first	model	of	the	real	proposal	.
it	made	my	building	look	sick	.
and	it	was	 th 	 is 	 	 interact 	 ion 	 	between	that	kind	of	,	up	-	the	-	 ant 	 e 	 	stuff	that	 be 	 came 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
it	led	to	the	building	on	the	left	.
and	i	still	think	the	time	magazine	picture	will	be	of	the	 bin 	 ocular 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	 leav 	 ing 	 	out	the	--	what	the	hell	.
i	use	a	lot	of	metal	in	my	work	,	and	i	have	a	hard	time	 connect 	 ing 	 	with	the	craft	.
the	whole	thing	about	my	house	,	the	whole	use	of	rough	 carp 	 entry 	 	and	 every 	 thing 	 	,	was	the	 frust 	 ration 	 	with	the	 craft 	 s 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	if	i	ca	n't	get	the	craft	that	i	want	,	i	'll	use	the	craft	i	can	get	.	``
there	 we 	 re 	 	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	 model 	 s 	 	for	that	,	in	rauschenberg	and	 ja 	 s 	 per 	 	johns	,	and	 man 	 y 	 	 artist 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	making	 beaut 	 iful 	 	art	and	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	with	junk	 material 	 s 	 	.
i	went	 in 	 to 	 	the	metal	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	a	way	of	building	a	building	that	was	a	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	.
and	it	was	all	of	one	material	,	and	the	metal	could	go	on	the	roof	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	the	 wall 	 s 	 	.
the	metalworkers	,	for	the	most	part	,	do	 duct 	 s 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	the	 ceil 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	stuff	.
i	was	 give 	 n 	 	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	design	an	exhibit	for	the	metalworkers	'	 un 	 ions 	 	of	america	and	canada	in	washington	,	and	i	did	it	on	the	condition	that	they	 be 	 come 	 	my	 partner 	 s 	 	in	the	future	and	help	me	with	all	future	metal	 building 	 s 	 	,	etc	.	etc	.
and	it	's	 work 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	well	to	have	these	people	,	these	 craft 	 s 	 men 	 	,	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	it	.
i	just	tell	the	 st 	 ories 	 	.
it	's	a	way	of	 connect 	 ing 	 	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	,	with	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	people	that	are	so	 import 	 ant 	 	to	the	 real 	 ization 	 	of	 architect 	 ure 	 	.
the	metal	 continu 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	building	--	herman	miller	,	in	sacramento	.
and	it	's	just	a	complex	of	 factor 	 y 	 	 building 	 s 	 	.
and	herman	miller	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 philosoph 	 y 	 	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	place	--	a	people	place	.
i	mean	,	it	's	kind	of	a	 t 	 rite 	 	thing	to	say	,	but	it	is	real	that	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	have	a	central	place	where	the	cafeteria	would	be	,	where	the	people	would	come	and	where	the	people	 work 	 ing 	 	would	interact	.
so	it	's	out	in	the	middle	of	 no 	 where 	 	,	and	you	approach	it	.
it	's	 cop 	 per 	 	and	 galvan 	 ize 	 	.
i	used	the	 galvan 	 ize 	 	and	 cop 	 per 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	light	gauge	,	so	it	would	 buck 	 le 	 	.
i	 s 	 pent 	 	a	lot	of	time	 un 	 do 	 ing 	 	richard	meier	's	aesthetic	.
 every 	 body 	 	's	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	the	 pan 	 el 	 s 	 	perfect	,	and	i	 al 	 ways 	 	try	to	get	them	 slop 	 py 	 	and	 fuzz 	 y 	 	.
and	they	end	up	looking	like	stone	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	central	area	.
there	's	a	ramp	.
and	that	little	 dom 	 e 	 	in	there	is	a	building	by	stanley	tigerman	.
stanley	was	 instrument 	 al 	 	in	my	 get 	 ting 	 	 th 	 is 	 	job	.
and	when	i	was	 a 	 ward 	 ed 	 	the	contract	i	,	at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	client	if	they	would	let	stanley	do	a	cameo	piece	with	me	.
 be 	 cause 	 	these	 we 	 re 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	,	building	 thing 	 s 	 	next	to	each	other	,	making	--	it	's	all	about	[	a	]	metaphor	for	a	city	,	 may 	 be 	 	.
and	so	stanley	did	the	little	 dom 	 e 	 	thing	.
and	we	did	it	over	the	phone	and	by	fax	.
he	would	 s 	 end 	 	me	a	fax	and	show	me	 some 	 thing 	 	.
he	'd	made	a	building	with	a	 dom 	 e 	 	and	he	had	a	little	tower	.
i	told	him	,	``	no	,	no	,	that	's	too	ongepotchket	.
i	do	n't	want	the	tower	.	``
so	he	came	back	with	a	 simpl 	 er 	 	building	,	but	he	put	some	funny	 detail 	 s 	 	on	it	,	and	he	 move 	 d 	 	it	 close 	 r 	 	to	my	building	.
and	so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	put	him	in	a	 depress 	 ion 	 	.
i	put	him	in	a	hole	and	made	a	kind	of	a	hole	that	he	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	in	.
and	so	then	he	put	two	 bridge 	 s 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	all	 happen 	 ed 	 	on	the	fax	,	going	back	and	forth	over	a	couple	of	 week 	 s 	 	'	period	.
and	he	put	these	two	 bridge 	 s 	 	with	pink	guardrails	on	it	.
and	so	then	i	put	 th 	 is 	 	big	 bill 	 board 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	it	.
and	i	call	it	,	``	david	and	 golia 	 th 	 	.	``
and	that	's	my	cafeteria	.
in	boston	,	we	had	that	old	building	on	the	left	.
it	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	prominent	building	off	the	 free 	 way 	 	,	and	we	 add 	 ed 	 	a	floor	and	 clean 	 ed 	 	it	up	and	 fix 	 ed 	 	it	up	and	used	the	kind	of	--	i	thought	--	the	language	of	the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	,	which	had	these	cornices	,	 project 	 ing 	 	cornices	.
mine	got	a	little	 ex 	 uber 	 ant 	 	,	but	i	used	lead	 cop 	 per 	 	,	which	is	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	material	,	and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	green	in	100	 year 	 s 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	,	like	,	 cop 	 per 	 	in	10	or	15	.
we	 re 	 did 	 	the	side	of	the	building	and	re	-	proportioned	the	 window 	 s 	 	so	it	sort	of	fit	 in 	 to 	 	the	space	.
and	it	 surprise 	 d 	 	both	boston	and	 my 	 self 	 	that	we	got	it	approved	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	have	 ver 	 y 	 	strict	kind	of	design	 guide 	 line 	 	,	and	they	would	n't	 normal 	 ly 	 	think	i	would	fit	them	.
the	 detail 	 ing 	 	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 care 	 ful 	 	with	the	lead	 cop 	 per 	 	and	making	 pan 	 el 	 s 	 	and	fitting	it	 tight 	 ly 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	fabric	of	the	 exist 	 ing 	 	building	.
in	barcelona	,	on	las	ramblas	for	some	film	 fest 	 ival 	 	,
i	did	the	hollywood	sign	going	and	coming	,	made	a	building	out	of	it	,	and	they	built	it	.
i	flew	in	one	night	and	took	 th 	 is 	 	picture	.
but	they	made	it	a	third	 small 	 er 	 	than	my	model	 with 	 out 	 	 tell 	 ing 	 	me	.
and	then	more	metal	and	some	chain	link	in	santa	monica	--	a	little	 shop 	 ping 	 	center	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	laser	 labor 	 atory 	 	at	the	university	of	iowa	,	in	which	the	fish	 come 	 s 	 	back	 a 	 s 	 	an	 abstract 	 ion 	 	in	the	back	.
it	's	the	support	 lab 	 s 	 	,	which	,	by	some	 co 	 incidence 	 	,	 requir 	 ed 	 	no	 window 	 s 	 	.
and	the	shape	fit	 perfect 	 ly 	 	.
i	just	 join 	 ed 	 	the	 point 	 s 	 	.
in	the	 curv 	 ed 	 	part	there	's	all	the	 mechanic 	 al 	 	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	.
that	solid	wall	 be 	 hind 	 	it	is	a	pipe	chase	--	a	pipe	canyon	--	and	so	it	was	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	that	i	 s 	 e 	 ized 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	did	n't	have	to	have	any	protruding	 duct 	 s 	 	or	 vent 	 s 	 	or	 thing 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	form	.
it	 g 	 ave 	 	me	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	make	a	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	out	of	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	small	house	 some 	 where 	 	.
they	've	 be 	 en 	 	building	it	so	long	i	do	n't	remember	where	it	is	.
it	's	in	the	west	 val 	 ley 	 	.
and	we	 start 	 ed 	 	with	the	stream	and	built	the	house	 a 	 long 	 	the	stream	--	 dam 	 med 	 	it	up	to	make	a	lake	.
these	are	the	 model 	 s 	 	.
the	 re 	 ality 	 	,	with	the	lake	--	the	 work 	 man 	 ship 	 	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	bad	.
and	it	 re 	 minded 	 	me	why	i	play	defensively	in	 thing 	 s 	 	like	my	house	.
when	you	have	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 cheap 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	hard	to	get	perfect	 corner 	 s 	 	and	stuff	.
that	big	metal	thing	is	a	 pass 	 age 	 	,	and	in	it	is	--	you	go	 down 	 stair 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	living	room	and	then	down	 in 	 to 	 	the	 bed 	 room 	 	,	which	is	on	the	right	.
it	's	kind	of	like	a	whole	built	town	.
i	was	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	do	a	hospital	for	schizophrenic	 adolescent 	 s 	 	at	yale	.
i	thought	it	was	fitting	for	me	to	be	 do 	 ing 	 	that	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	house	next	to	a	philip	johnson	house	in	minnesota	.
the	 owner 	 s 	 	had	a	dilemma	--	they	 ask 	 ed 	 	philip	to	do	it	.
he	was	too	 bus 	 y 	 	.
he	did	n't	recommend	me	,	by	the	way	.
we	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	make	it	a	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	dilemma	was	,	how	do	you	build	a	building	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	look	like	the	language	?
is	it	going	to	look	like	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 e 	 state 	 	is	sub	-	 divid 	 ed 	 	?
etc	.	etc	.
you	've	got	the	idea	.
and	so	we	 final 	 ly 	 	 end 	 ed 	 	up	making	it	.
these	people	are	art	 collect 	 ors 	 	.
and	we	 final 	 ly 	 	made	it	so	it	 appear 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 sculpt 	 ural 	 	from	the	main	house	and	all	the	 window 	 s 	 	are	on	the	other	side	.
and	the	building	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 sculpt 	 ural 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	walk	around	it	.
it	's	made	of	metal	and	the	 brow 	 n 	 	stuff	is	fin	-	ply	--	it	's	that	 form 	 ed 	 	lumber	from	finland	.
we	used	it	at	loyola	on	the	 cha 	 pel 	 	,	and	it	did	n't	work	.
i	keep	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	it	work	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	how	to	detail	it	.
in	cleveland	,	there	's	burnham	mall	,	on	the	left	.
it	's	never	 be 	 en 	 	 finish 	 ed 	 	.
going	out	to	the	lake	,	you	can	see	all	 t 	 hose 	 	new	 building 	 s 	 	we	built	.
and	we	had	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	build	a	building	on	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
there	's	a	 rail 	 road 	 	track	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	city	hall	over	here	 some 	 where 	 	,	and	the	 court 	 house 	 	.
and	the	 center 	 line 	 	of	the	mall	 go 	 es 	 	out	.
burnham	had	designed	a	 rail 	 road 	 	station	that	was	never	built	,	and	so	we	 follow 	 ed 	 	.
sohio	is	on	the	axis	here	,	and	we	 follow 	 ed 	 	the	axis	,	and	they	're	two	kind	of	goalposts	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	our	building	,	which	is	a	corporate	 head 	 quarter 	 s 	 	for	an	 insur 	 ance 	 	company	.
we	 collabor 	 ated 	 	with	oldenburg	and	put	the	 news 	 paper 	 	on	top	,	 fold 	 ed 	 	.
the	health	club	is	 fast 	 ened 	 	to	the	 gar 	 age 	 	with	a	c	-	 clam 	 p 	 	,	for	cleveland	.
you	drive	down	.
so	it	's	about	a	10	-	story	c	-	 clam 	 p 	 	.
and	all	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	at	the	bottom	is	a	museum	,	and	an	idea	for	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 f 	 ancy 	 	 auto 	 mobile 	 	entry	.
 th 	 is 	 	owner	 ha 	 s 	 	a	pet	peeve	about	bad	 auto 	 mobile 	 	 ent 	 ries 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	would	be	a	hotel	.
so	,	the	 center 	 line 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	thing	--	we	'd	preserve	it	,	and	it	would	start	to	work	with	the	scale	of	the	new	 building 	 s 	 	by	pelli	and	kohn	pederson	fox	,	etc	.	,	that	are	 under 	 way 	 	.
it	's	hard	to	do	high	-	rise	.
i	feel	much	more	 comfort 	 able 	 	down	here	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	piece	of	 proper 	 ty 	 	in	brentwood	.
and	a	long	time	ago	,	about	'82	or	 some 	 thing 	 	,	after	my	house	--	i	designed	a	house	for	 my 	 self 	 	that	would	be	a	village	of	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 pavilion 	 s 	 	around	a	 court 	 yard 	 	--	and	the	owner	of	 th 	 is 	 	lot	 work 	 ed 	 	for	me	and	built	that	actual	model	on	the	left	.
and	she	came	back	,	i	guess	 wealth 	 ier 	 	or	 some 	 thing 	 	--	 some 	 thing 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	--	and	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	to	design	a	house	for	her	on	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
and	 follow 	 ing 	 	that	 bas 	 ic 	 	idea	of	the	village	,	we	 change 	 d 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	we	got	 in 	 to 	 	it	.
i	 lock 	 ed 	 	the	house	 in 	 to 	 	the	 s 	 ite 	 	by	cutting	the	back	end	--	here	you	see	on	the	 photograph 	 s 	 	of	the	 s 	 ite 	 	--	 s 	 lic 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	it	and	 put 	 ting 	 	all	the	 bath 	 rooms 	 	and	 dress 	 ing 	 	rooms	like	a	 retain 	 ing 	 	wall	,	creating	a	lower	level	zone	for	the	master	 bed 	 room 	 	,	which	i	designed	like	a	kind	of	a	 bar 	 ge 	 	,	looking	like	a	boat	.
and	that	's	it	,	built	.
the	 dom 	 e 	 	was	a	request	from	the	client	.
she	 want 	 ed 	 	a	 dom 	 e 	 	 some 	 where 	 	in	the	house	.
she	did	n't	care	where	.
when	you	sleep	in	 th 	 is 	 	 bed 	 room 	 	,	i	hope	--	i	mean	,	i	have	n't	slept	in	it	yet	.
i	've	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	to	marry	her	so	i	could	sleep	there	,	but	she	 s 	 aid 	 	i	did	n't	have	to	do	that	.
but	when	you	're	in	that	room	,	you	feel	like	you	're	on	a	kind	of	 bar 	 ge 	 	on	some	kind	of	lake	.
and	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	private	.
the	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	is	 be 	 ing 	 	built	around	to	create	a	private	garden	.
and	then	up	above	there	's	a	garden	on	 th 	 is 	 	side	of	the	living	room	,	and	one	on	the	other	side	.
these	are	n't	focused	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.
i	do	n't	know	how	to	do	it	from	here	.
focus	the	one	on	the	right	.
it	's	up	there	.
left	--	it	's	my	right	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	you	enter	 in 	 to 	 	a	garden	with	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	grove	of	 tree 	 s 	 	.
that	's	the	living	room	.
 serv 	 ants 	 	'	 quarter 	 s 	 	.
a	guest	 bed 	 room 	 	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 dom 	 e 	 	with	 mar 	 ble 	 	on	it	.
and	then	you	enter	 in 	 to 	 	the	living	room	and	then	so	on	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 bed 	 room 	 	.
you	come	down	from	 th 	 is 	 	level	 a 	 long 	 	the	 stair 	 way 	 	,	and	you	enter	the	 bed 	 room 	 	here	,	going	 in 	 to 	 	the	lake	.
and	the	bed	is	back	in	 th 	 is 	 	space	,	with	 window 	 s 	 	looking	out	onto	the	lake	.
these	stonehenge	 thing 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	designed	to	give	 fore 	 ground 	 	and	to	create	a	 great 	 er 	 	depth	in	 th 	 is 	 	 sh 	 allow 	 	lot	.
the	material	is	lead	 cop 	 per 	 	,	like	in	the	building	in	boston	.
and	so	it	was	an	intent	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	small	piece	of	land	--	it	's	100	by	250	--	 in 	 to 	 	a	kind	of	an	 e 	 state 	 	by	 separat 	 ing 	 	these	 area 	 s 	 	and	making	the	living	room	and	 din 	 ing 	 	room	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	pavilion	with	a	high	space	in	it	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	by	accident	that	i	got	 th 	 is 	 	right	on	axis	with	the	 din 	 ing 	 	room	table	.
it	 look 	 s 	 	like	i	got	a	baldessari	 paint 	 ing 	 	for	free	.
but	the	idea	is	,	the	 window 	 s 	 	are	all	 place 	 d 	 	so	you	see	 piece 	 s 	 	of	the	house	 out 	 side 	 	.
 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	will	be	 screen 	 ed 	 	--	these	 tree 	 s 	 	will	come	up	--	and	it	will	be	 ver 	 y 	 	private	.
and	you	feel	like	you	're	in	your	own	kind	of	village	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	for	michael	eisner	--	disney	.
we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	some	work	for	him	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	in	anaheim	,	california	,	and	it	's	a	 free 	 way 	 	building	.
you	go	under	 th 	 is 	 	bridge	at	about	65	 mile 	 s 	 	an	hour	,	and	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	bridge	here	.
and	you	're	through	 th 	 is 	 	room	in	a	split	second	,	and	the	building	will	sort	of	reflect	that	.
on	the	 back 	 side 	 	,	it	's	much	more	 human 	 e 	 	--	 en 	 trance 	 	,	 din 	 ing 	 	hall	,	etc	.
and	then	 th 	 is 	 	thing	here	--	i	'm	 hop 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	drive	by	you	'll	hear	the	 pick 	 et 	 	 f 	 ence 	 	effect	of	the	sound	hitting	it	.
kind	of	a	 f 	 un 	 	thing	to	do	.
i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	a	building	in	switzerland	,	basel	,	which	is	an	 off 	 ice 	 	building	for	a	furniture	company	.
and	we	 struggle 	 d 	 	with	the	image	.
these	are	the	early	 stud 	 ies 	 	,	but	they	have	to	sell	furniture	to	normal	people	,	so	if	i	did	the	building	and	it	was	too	 f 	 ancy 	 	,	then	people	might	say	,	``	well	,	the	furniture	 look 	 s 	 	ok	in	his	thing	,	but	no	,	it	ai	n't	going	to	look	good	in	my	normal	building	.	``
so	we	've	made	a	kind	of	 pragmat 	 ic 	 	 s 	 lab 	 	in	the	second	phase	here	,	and	we	've	taken	the	 con 	 ference 	 	 facil 	 ities 	 	and	made	a	villa	out	of	them	so	that	the	 commun 	 al 	 	space	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 sculpt 	 ural 	 	and	 separat 	 e 	 	.
and	you	're	looking	at	it	from	the	 off 	 ice 	 s 	 	and	you	create	a	kind	of	 interact 	 ion 	 	between	these	 piece 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	in	paris	,	 a 	 long 	 	the	seine	.
palais	 de 	 s 	 	 s 	 port 	 s 	 	,	the	gare	de	lyon	over	here	.
the	 mini 	 ster 	 	of	finance	--	the	guy	that	 move 	 d 	 	from	the	louvre	--	 go 	 es 	 	in	here	.
there	's	a	new	library	 a 	 cross 	 	the	river	.
and	back	in	here	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	treed	park	,	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	dense	building	 call 	 ed 	 	the	american	center	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	a	theater	,	 a 	 part 	 ments 	 	,	dance	school	,	an	art	museum	,	 restaurant 	 s 	 	and	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	--	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	dense	program	--	 book 	 store 	 s 	 	,	etc	.
in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	tight	,	small	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	ground	level	.
and	the	french	have	 th 	 is 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	way	of	 screw 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	up	by	taking	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	and	cutting	the	corner	off	.
they	call	it	the	plan	coupe	.
and	i	 struggle 	 d 	 	with	that	thing	--	how	to	get	around	the	corner	.
these	are	the	 model 	 s 	 	for	it	.
i	 show 	 ed 	 	you	the	other	model	,	the	one	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	way	i	 organize 	 d 	 	 my 	 self 	 	so	i	could	make	the	 draw 	 ing 	 	--	so	i	 under 	 stood 	 	the	problem	.
i	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	around	 th 	 is 	 	plan	coupe	--	how	do	you	do	it	?
 a 	 part 	 ments 	 	,	etc	.
and	these	are	the	kind	of	 stud 	 y 	 	 model 	 s 	 	we	did	.
and	the	one	on	the	left	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	awful	.
you	can	see	why	i	was	ready	to	commit	 su 	 icide 	 	when	 th 	 is 	 	one	was	built	.
but	out	of	it	came	 final 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 solution 	 	,	where	the	 elev 	 ator 	 	piece	 work 	 ed 	 	 frontal 	 ly 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	,	parallel	to	 th 	 is 	 	street	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	parallel	to	here	.
and	then	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	twist	,	with	 th 	 is 	 	 balc 	 ony 	 	and	the	skirt	,	kind	of	like	a	 ball 	 er 	 ina 	 	 lift 	 ing 	 	her	skirt	to	let	you	 in 	 to 	 	the	foyer	.
the	 restaurant 	 s 	 	here	--	the	 a 	 part 	 ments 	 	and	the	theater	,	etc	.
so	it	would	all	be	built	in	stone	,	in	french	 lime 	 stone 	 	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	metal	piece	.
and	it	 face 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	park	.
and	the	idea	was	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	express	the	energy	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
on	the	side	facing	the	street	it	's	much	more	normal	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	i	 s 	 lipped 	 	a	few	mansards	down	,	so	that	coming	on	the	point	,	these	housing	 unit 	 s 	 	made	a	 gest 	 ure 	 	to	the	corner	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	will	be	some	kind	of	high	-	tech	 bill 	 board 	 	.
if	any	of	you	 guy 	 s 	 	have	any	 idea 	 s 	 	for	it	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	contact	me	.
i	do	n't	know	what	to	do	.
jay	chiat	is	a	glutton	for	 punish 	 ment 	 	,	and	he	 hire 	 d 	 	me	to	do	a	house	for	him	in	the	hamptons	.
and	it	's	got	a	fish	.
and	i	keep	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	be	the	last	fish	.	``
it	's	like	a	drug	addict	.
i	say	,	``	i	'm	not	going	to	do	it	 any 	 more 	 	--	i	do	n't	want	to	do	it	 any 	 more 	 	--	i	'm	not	going	to	do	it	.	``
and	then	i	do	it	.
there	it	is	.
but	it	's	the	living	room	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	piece	here	is	--	i	do	n't	know	what	it	is	.
i	just	 add 	 ed 	 	it	so	that	we	'd	have	 en 	 ough 	 	money	in	the	budget	so	we	could	take	 some 	 thing 	 	out	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	euro	disney	,	and	i	've	 work 	 ed 	 	with	all	of	the	 guy 	 s 	 	that	 present 	 ed 	 	to	you	 ear 	 lier 	 	.
we	've	had	a	lot	of	 f 	 un 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	together	.
i	think	i	'm	from	mars	for	them	,	and	they	are	for	me	,	but	 some 	 how 	 	we	all	manage	to	work	together	,	and	i	think	,	 productive 	 ly 	 	.
so	far	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 shop 	 ping 	 	thing	.
you	come	 in 	 to 	 	the	magic	 king 	 dom 	 	and	the	hotel	that	tony	baxter	's	group	is	 do 	 ing 	 	out	here	.	and	then	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	kind	of	a	 shop 	 ping 	 	mall	,	with	a	rodeo	and	 restaurant 	 s 	 	.
and	 an 	 other 	 	restaurant	.
what	i	did	--	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	paris	 ski 	 es 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	dull	,	i	made	a	light	grid	that	's	 per 	 pend 	 icular 	 	to	the	train	station	,	to	the	route	of	the	train	.
it	 look 	 s 	 	like	it	's	kind	of	 be 	 en 	 	there	,	and	then	 crash 	 ed 	 	all	these	 simpl 	 er 	 	 form 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	it	.
the	light	grid	will	have	a	light	,	be	lit	up	at	night	and	give	a	kind	of	light	 ceil 	 ing 	 	.
in	switzerland	--	germany	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	on	the	rhine	 a 	 cross 	 	from	basel	,	we	did	a	furniture	 factor 	 y 	 	and	a	furniture	museum	.
and	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	--	there	's	a	nick	grimshaw	building	over	here	,	there	's	an	oldenburg	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	over	here	--	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	make	a	relationship	urbanistically	.
and	i	do	n't	 g 	 ave 	 	good	 slide 	 s 	 	to	show	--	it	's	just	 be 	 en 	 	 complete 	 d 	 	--	but	 th 	 is 	 	piece	here	is	 th 	 is 	 	building	,	and	these	 piece 	 s 	 	here	and	here	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	pass	by	it	's	 al 	 ways 	 	part	--	you	see	it	 a 	 s 	 	all	of	these	 piece 	 s 	 	accrue	and	 be 	 come 	 	part	of	an	 over 	 all 	 	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	.
it	's	 plast 	 er 	 	and	just	 z 	 inc 	 	.
and	you	wonder	,	if	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	museum	,	what	it	's	going	to	be	like	 in 	 side 	 	?
if	it	's	going	to	be	so	 bus 	 y 	 	and	crazy	that	you	would	n't	show	 any 	 thing 	 	,	and	just	wait	.
i	'm	so	 cunn 	 ing 	 	and	clever	--	i	made	it	quiet	and	 wonder 	 ful 	 	.
but	on	the	 out 	 side 	 	it	 do 	 es 	 	 s 	 cream 	 	out	at	you	a	bit	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	three	square	rooms	with	a	couple	of	 sky 	 light 	 s 	 	and	stuff	.
and	from	the	building	in	the	back	,	you	see	it	 a 	 s 	 	an	 ice 	 berg 	 	 float 	 ing 	 	by	in	the	 hill 	 s 	 	.
i	know	i	'm	over	time	.
see	,	that	skylight	 go 	 es 	 	down	and	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	that	one	.
so	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	quiet	 in 	 side 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	disney	hall	--	the	concert	hall	.
it	's	a	 complic 	 ated 	 	project	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	chamber	hall	.
it	's	related	to	an	 exist 	 ing 	 	chandler	pavilion	that	was	built	with	a	lot	of	love	and	 tear 	 s 	 	and	 car 	 ing 	 	.
and	it	's	not	a	great	building	,	but	i	 approach 	 ed 	 	it	 optimist 	 ically 	 	,	that	we	would	make	a	 com 	 position 	 al 	 	relationship	between	us	that	would	 strength 	 en 	 	both	of	us	.
and	the	plan	of	 th 	 is 	 	--	it	's	a	concert	hall	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	foyer	,	which	is	kind	of	a	garden	structure	.
there	's	commercial	at	the	ground	floor	.
these	are	 off 	 ice 	 s 	 	,	which	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	in	the	 com 	 petition 	 	,	we	did	n't	have	to	design	.
but	 final 	 ly 	 	,	there	's	a	hotel	there	.
these	 we 	 re 	 	the	kind	of	 relationship 	 s 	 	made	to	the	chandler	,	 com 	 posing 	 	these	elevations	together	and	 relat 	 ing 	 	them	to	the	 building 	 s 	 	that	 exist 	 ed 	 	--	to	moca	,	etc	.
the	 acoustic 	 ian 	 	in	the	 com 	 petition 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	us	 cri 	 ter 	 ia 	 	,	which	led	to	 th 	 is 	 	 compartment 	 al 	 ized 	 	scheme	,	which	we	found	out	after	the	 com 	 petition 	 	would	not	work	at	all	.
but	 every 	 body 	 	 like 	 d 	 	these	 form 	 s 	 	and	 like 	 d 	 	the	space	,	and	so	that	's	one	of	the	 problem 	 s 	 	of	a	 com 	 petition 	 	.
you	have	to	then	try	and	get	that	back	in	some	way	.
and	we	 stud 	 ied 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 model 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	our	original	model	.
these	 we 	 re 	 	the	three	 building 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	the	ideal	--	the	concertgebouw	,	boston	and	berlin	.
 every 	 body 	 	 like 	 d 	 	the	surround	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 small 	 est 	 	hall	in	 s 	 ize 	 	,	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	more	 seat 	 s 	 	than	any	of	these	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	double	 balc 	 onies 	 	.
our	client	 do 	 es 	 	n't	want	 balc 	 onies 	 	,	so	--	and	when	we	met	our	new	 acoustic 	 ian 	 	,	he	told	us	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	right	shape	or	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	right	shape	.
and	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 shape 	 s 	 	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	the	energy	of	the	original	design	 with 	 in 	 	an	 acoustic 	 al 	 	,	 accept 	 able 	 	format	.
we	 final 	 ly 	 	 settl 	 ed 	 	on	a	shape	that	was	the	proportion	of	the	concertgebouw	with	the	sloping	 out 	 side 	 	 wall 	 s 	 	,	which	the	 acoustic 	 ian 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 cruci 	 al 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	and	 lat 	 er 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	,	but	now	we	have	them	.
and	our	idea	is	to	make	the	 s 	 eating 	 	carriage	 ver 	 y 	 	 sculpt 	 ural 	 	and	out	of	wood	and	like	a	big	boat	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 plast 	 er 	 	room	.
that	's	the	idea	.
and	the	 corner 	 s 	 	would	have	 sky 	 light 	 s 	 	and	these	 column 	 s 	 	would	be	structural	.
and	the	nice	thing	about	 introduc 	 ing 	 	 column 	 s 	 	is	they	give	you	a	kind	of	sense	of	 pro 	 scen 	 ium 	 	from	 where 	 ver 	 	you	 s 	 it 	 	,	and	create	 in 	 timacy 	 	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	final	design	--	these	are	just	on	the	way	to	 be 	 ing 	 	--	and	so	i	would	n't	take	it	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	the	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	the	space	.
we	 stud 	 ied 	 	the	 acoustic 	 s 	 	with	laser	stuff	,	and	they	 bounc 	 e 	 	them	off	 th 	 is 	 	and	see	where	it	all	 work 	 s 	 	.
but	you	get	the	sense	of	the	hall	in	section	.
most	 hall 	 s 	 	come	straight	down	 in 	 to 	 	a	 pro 	 scen 	 ium 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	we	're	 open 	 ing 	 	it	back	up	and	 get 	 ting 	 	 sky 	 light 	 s 	 	in	the	four	 corner 	 s 	 	.
and	so	it	will	be	 quit 	 e 	 	a	different	shape	.
the	original	building	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	frog	-	like	,	fit	 nice 	 ly 	 	on	the	 s 	 ite 	 	and	 crank 	 ed 	 	 it 	 self 	 	well	.
when	you	get	 in 	 to 	 	a	box	,	it	's	 hard 	 er 	 	to	do	it	--	and	here	we	are	,	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	with	how	to	put	the	hotel	in	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	teapot	i	designed	for	alessi	.
i	just	 s 	 tuck 	 	it	on	there	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	i	do	work	.	i	do	take	 piece 	 s 	 	and	bits	and	look	at	it	and	struggle	with	it	and	cut	it	away	.
and	of	course	it	's	not	going	to	look	like	that	,	but	it	is	the	crazy	way	i	tend	to	work	.
and	then	 final 	 ly 	 	,	in	l.a.	i	was	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	do	a	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	at	the	foot	of	 inter 	 state 	 	bank	tower	,	the	highest	building	in	l.a	.
larry	halprin	is	 do 	 ing 	 	the	 stair 	 s 	 	.
and	i	was	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	do	a	fish	,	and	so	i	did	a	snake	.
it	's	a	public	space	,	and	i	made	it	kind	of	a	garden	structure	,	and	you	can	go	in	it	.
it	's	a	kiva	,	and	larry	's	 put 	 ting 	 	some	water	in	there	,	and	it	 work 	 s 	 	much	better	than	a	fish	.
in	barcelona	i	was	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	do	a	fish	,	and	we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	on	that	,	at	the	foot	of	a	ritz	-	carlton	tower	 be 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	by
skidmore	,	owings	and	merrill	.
and	the	ritz	-	carlton	tower	is	 be 	 ing 	 	designed	with	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	steel	,	non	-	fire	proof	,	much	like	 t 	 hose 	 	old	gas	 tank 	 s 	 	.
and	so	we	took	the	language	of	 th 	 is 	 	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	steel	and	used	it	,	 per 	 vert 	 ed 	 	it	,	 in 	 to 	 	the	form	of	the	fish	,	and	 create 	 d 	 	a	kind	of	a	19th	-	century	contraption	that	 look 	 s 	 	like	,	that	will	 s 	 it 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	beach	and	the	harbor	out	in	front	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	a	 shop 	 ping 	 	center	with	 depart 	 ment 	 	 store 	 s 	 	.
and	we	split	these	 bridge 	 s 	 	.
 original 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	all	solid	with	a	hole	in	it	.
we	cut	them	loose	and	made	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 bridge 	 s 	 	and	 create 	 d 	 	a	kind	of	a	 fore 	 ground 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	hotel	.
we	 show 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	to	the	hotel	people	the	other	day	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 terr 	 ified 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	that	 no 	 body 	 	would	come	to	the	ritz	-	carlton	 any 	 more 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	fish	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	i	just	threw	these	in	--	lou	danziger	.
i	did	n't	expect	lou	danziger	to	be	here	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	building	i	did	for	him	in	1964	,	i	think	.
a	little	studio	--	and	it	's	 s 	 ad 	 ly 	 	for	sale	.
time	 go 	 es 	 	on	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	son	 work 	 ing 	 	with	me	on	a	small	fast	-	food	thing	.
he	designed	the	robot	 a 	 s 	 	the	 cash 	 ier 	 	,	and	the	head	 move 	 s 	 	,	and	i	did	the	rest	of	it	.
and	the	food	was	n't	 a 	 s 	 	good	 a 	 s 	 	the	stuff	,	and	so	it	 fail 	 ed 	 	.
it	should	have	 be 	 en 	 	the	other	way	around	--	the	food	should	have	 be 	 en 	 	good	first	.
it	did	n't	work	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
