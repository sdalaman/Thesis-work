 th 	 is 	 	is	the	large	hadron	collider	.
it	's	27	 kilometer 	 s 	 	in	 circum 	 ference 	 	.	it	's	the	 big 	 gest 	 	scientific	experiment	ever	 attempt 	 ed 	 	.
over	10,000	 physicist 	 s 	 	and	 engineer 	 s 	 	from	85	 count 	 ries 	 	around	the	world	have	come	together	over	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 decade 	 s 	 	to	build	 th 	 is 	 	machine	.
what	we	do	is	we	 accele 	 rate 	 	 proton 	 s 	 	--	so	,	hydrogen	nuclei	--	around	99.999999
percent	the	speed	of	light	.
right	?	at	that	speed	,	they	go	around	that	27	 kilometer 	 s 	 	11,000	 time 	 s 	 	a	second	.
and	we	collide	them	with	 an 	 other 	 	beam	of	 proton 	 s 	 	going	in	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	direction	.
we	collide	them	 in 	 side 	 	giant	 detect 	 ors 	 	.
they	're	 essential 	 ly 	 	digital	 camera 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	one	that	i	work	on	,	atlas	.
you	get	some	sense	of	the	 s 	 ize 	 	--	you	can	just	see	these	eu	standard	-	 s 	 ize 	 	people	 under 	 neath 	 	.
you	get	some	sense	of	the	 s 	 ize 	 	:	44	 meter 	 s 	 	wide	,	22	 meter 	 s 	 	in	 dia 	 meter 	 	,	7,000	 ton 	 s 	 	.
and	we	re	-	create	the	 condition 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	present	less	than	a	 billion 	 th 	 	of	a	second	after	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	up	to	600	million	 time 	 s 	 	a	second	 in 	 side 	 	that	 detect 	 or 	 	--	immense	 number 	 s 	 	.
and	if	you	see	 t 	 hose 	 	metal	bits	there	--	 t 	 hose 	 	are	huge	 magnet 	 s 	 	that	bend	 electric 	 ally 	 	charged	 particle 	 s 	 	,	so	it	can	measure	how	fast	they	're	 travel 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	about	a	year	ago	.
 t 	 hose 	 	 magnet 	 s 	 	are	in	there	.
and	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	a	eu	standard	-	 s 	 ize 	 	,	real	person	,	so	you	get	some	sense	of	the	scale	.
and	it	's	in	there	that	 t 	 hose 	 	mini	-	big	 bang 	 s 	 	will	be	 create 	 d 	 	,	 some 	 time 	 	in	the	summer	 th 	 is 	 	year	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	i	got	an	email	 say 	 ing 	 	that	we	've	just	 finish 	 ed 	 	,	 to 	 day 	 	,	building	the	last	piece	of	atlas	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	of	 to 	 day 	 	,	it	's	 finish 	 ed 	 	.	i	'd	like	to	say	that	i	 plan 	 ned 	 	that	for	ted	,	but	i	did	n't	.	so	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 complete 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	of	 to 	 day 	 	.
 yea 	 h 	 	,	it	's	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 achiev 	 ement 	 	.
so	,	you	might	be	 ask 	 ing 	 	,	``	why	?
why	create	the	 condition 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	present	less	than	a	 billion 	 th 	 	of	a	second	after	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	?	``
well	,	particle	 physicist 	 s 	 	are	 noth 	 ing 	 	if	not	 ambit 	 ious 	 	.
and	the	aim	of	particle	physics	is	to	understand	what	 every 	 thing 	 	's	made	of	,	and	how	 every 	 thing 	 	 stick 	 s 	 	together	.
and	by	 every 	 thing 	 	i	mean	,	of	course	,	me	and	you	,	the	earth	,	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	the	100	billion	 s 	 un 	 s 	 	in	our	 galax 	 y 	 	and	the	100	billion	 galax 	 ies 	 	in	the	 observ 	 able 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
 absolute 	 ly 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	.
now	you	might	say	,	``	well	,	ok	,	but	why	not	just	look	at	it	?
you	know	?	if	you	want	to	know	what	i	'm	made	of	,	let	's	look	at	me	.	``
well	,	we	found	that	 a 	 s 	 	you	look	back	in	time	,	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 get 	 s 	 	 hot 	 ter 	 	and	 hot 	 ter 	 	,	 den 	 s 	 er 	 	and	 den 	 s 	 er 	 	,	and	 simpl 	 er 	 	and	 simpl 	 er 	 	.
now	,	there	's	no	real	reason	i	'm	aware	of	for	that	,	but	that	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	the	case	.
so	,	way	back	in	the	early	 time 	 s 	 	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	we	 believ 	 e 	 	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	and	 understand 	 able 	 	.
all	 th 	 is 	 	 complex 	 ity 	 	,	all	the	way	to	these	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	--	human	 brain 	 s 	 	--	are	a	 proper 	 ty 	 	of	an	old	and	cold	and	 complic 	 ated 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
back	at	the	start	,	in	the	first	 billion 	 th 	 	of	a	second	,	we	 believ 	 e 	 	,	or	we	've	 observ 	 ed 	 	,	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	.
it	's	 al 	 most 	 	like	...
imagine	a	 snow 	 flake 	 	in	your	hand	,	and	you	look	at	it	,	and	it	's	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	,	 beaut 	 iful 	 	object	.	but	 a 	 s 	 	you	heat	it	up	,	it	'll	melt	 in 	 to 	 	a	pool	of	water	,	and	you	would	be	able	to	see	that	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	it	was	just	made	of	h	20	,	water	.
so	it	's	in	that	same	sense	that	we	look	back	in	time	to	understand	what	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	made	of	.
and	,	 a 	 s 	 	of	 to 	 day 	 	,	it	's	made	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
just	12	 particle 	 s 	 	of	matter	,	 s 	 tuck 	 	together	by	four	 force 	 s 	 	of	nature	.
the	 quar 	 k 	 s 	 	,	these	pink	 thing 	 s 	 	,	are	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	make	up	 proton 	 s 	 	and	 neutron 	 s 	 	that	make	up	the	atomic	nuclei	in	your	body	.
the	electron	--	the	thing	that	 go 	 es 	 	around	the	atomic	nucleus	--	held	around	in	orbit	,	by	the	way	,	by	the	 electro 	 magnet 	 ic 	 	force	that	's	carried	by	 th 	 is 	 	thing	,	the	 photo 	 n 	 	.
the	 quar 	 k 	 s 	 	are	 s 	 tuck 	 	together	by	other	 thing 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 glu 	 on 	 s 	 	.	and	these	 guy 	 s 	 	,	here	,	they	're	the	weak	nuclear	force	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	 l 	 east 	 	familiar	.
but	,	 with 	 out 	 	it	,	the	 s 	 un 	 	would	n't	shine	.
and	when	the	 s 	 un 	 	 shine 	 s 	 	,	you	get	 cop 	 ious 	 	 quant 	 ities 	 	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 call 	 ed 	 	 neutrino 	 s 	 	,	 pour 	 ing 	 	out	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	if	you	just	look	at	your	 thumb 	 nail 	 	--	about	a	square	centimeter	--	there	are	 some 	 thing 	 	like	60	billion	 neutrino 	 s 	 	per	second	from	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	 pass 	 ing 	 	through	every	square	centimeter	of	your	body	.
but	you	do	n't	feel	them	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	weak	force	is	 correct 	 ly 	 	named	--
 ver 	 y 	 	short	range	and	 ver 	 y 	 	weak	,	so	they	just	fly	through	you	.
and	these	 particle 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	over	the	last	century	,	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	.
the	first	one	,	the	electron	,	was	 discover 	 ed 	 	in	1897	,	and	the	last	one	,	 th 	 is 	 	thing	 call 	 ed 	 	the	tau	neutrino	,	in	the	year	2000	.	 actual 	 ly 	 	just	--	i	was	going	to	say	,	just	up	the	road	in	chicago	.	i	know	it	's	a	big	country	,	america	,	is	n't	it	?
just	up	the	road	.
 relat 	 ive 	 	to	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	it	's	just	up	the	road	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	thing	was	 discover 	 ed 	 	in	the	year	2000	,	so	it	's	a	 relat 	 ively 	 	 re 	 cent 	 	picture	.
one	of	the	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	find	,	is	that	we	've	 discover 	 ed 	 	any	of	them	,	when	you	 real 	 ize 	 	how	 tin 	 y 	 	they	are	.
you	know	,	they	're	a	step	in	 s 	 ize 	 	from	the	entire	 observ 	 able 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
so	,	100	billion	 galax 	 ies 	 	,	13.7	billion	light	 year 	 s 	 	away	--	a	step	in	 s 	 ize 	 	from	that	to	monterey	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	is	about	the	same	 a 	 s 	 	from	monterey	to	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 absolute 	 ly 	 	,	 exquisite 	 ly 	 	minute	,	and	yet	we	've	 discover 	 ed 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	the	full	set	.
so	,	one	of	my	most	 illustr 	 ious 	 	 fore 	 bear 	 s 	 	at	manchester	university	,	ernest	rutherford	,	 discover 	 er 	 	of	the	atomic	nucleus	,	once	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	all	science	is	either	physics	or	stamp	 collect 	 ing 	 	.	``
now	,	i	do	n't	think	he	 me 	 ant 	 	to	insult	the	rest	of	science	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	he	was	from	new	zealand	,	so	it	's	possible	.
but	what	he	 me 	 ant 	 	was	that	what	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	is	stamp	collect	there	.	ok	,	we	've	 discover 	 ed 	 	the	 particle 	 s 	 	,	but	 un 	 less 	 	you	understand	the	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	reason	for	that	pattern	--	you	know	,	why	it	's	built	the	way	it	is	--	 re 	 ally 	 	you	've	 d 	 one 	 	stamp	 collect 	 ing 	 	.	you	have	n't	 d 	 one 	 	science	.
 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	we	have	 prob 	 ably 	 	one	of	the	 great 	 est 	 	scientific	 achiev 	 ement 	 s 	 	of	the	 t 	 went 	 ieth 	 	century	that	 under 	 pin 	 s 	 	that	pattern	.
it	's	the	newton	's	 law 	 s 	 	,	if	you	want	,	of	particle	physics	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	standard	model	--	 beaut 	 i 	 fully 	 	simple	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 equ 	 ation 	 	.
you	could	stick	it	on	the	front	of	a	t	-	shirt	,	which	is	 al 	 ways 	 	the	sign	of	 e 	 leg 	 ance 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	it	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	a	little	 dis 	 ing 	 en 	 uous 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	've	 expand 	 ed 	 	it	out	in	all	 it 	 s 	 	gory	detail	.
 th 	 is 	 	 equ 	 ation 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	 allow 	 s 	 	you	to	 calcul 	 ate 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	--	other	than	 gravit 	 y 	 	--	that	 happen 	 s 	 	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
so	,	you	want	to	know	why	the	sky	is	blue	,	why	atomic	nuclei	stick	together	--	in	principle	,	you	've	got	a	big	 en 	 ough 	 	computer	--	why	dna	is	the	shape	it	is	.
in	principle	,	you	should	be	able	to	 calcul 	 ate 	 	it	from	that	 equ 	 ation 	 	.
but	there	's	a	problem	.
can	 any 	 one 	 	see	what	it	is	?
a	bottle	of	 champ 	 agne 	 	for	 any 	 one 	 	that	 tell 	 s 	 	me	.
i	'll	make	it	 eas 	 ier 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	by	 blow 	 ing 	 	one	of	the	lines	up	.	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	each	of	these	 term 	 s 	 	 refer 	 s 	 	to	some	of	the	 particle 	 s 	 	.
so	 t 	 hose 	 	ws	there	refer	to	the	ws	,	and	how	they	stick	together	.
these	 car 	 rier 	 s 	 	of	the	weak	force	,	the	zs	,	the	same	.
but	there	's	an	extra	symbol	in	 th 	 is 	 	 equ 	 ation 	 	:	h	.
right	,	h	.
h	 stand 	 s 	 	for	higgs	particle	.
higgs	 particle 	 s 	 	have	not	 be 	 en 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	.
but	they	're	 necess 	 ary 	 	:	they	're	 necess 	 ary 	 	to	make	that	 mathematic 	 s 	 	work	.
so	all	the	 exquisite 	 ly 	 	 detail 	 ed 	 	 calcul 	 ations 	 	we	can	do	with	that	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 equ 	 ation 	 	would	n't	be	possible	 with 	 out 	 	an	extra	bit	.
so	it	's	a	 predict 	 ion 	 	:	a	 predict 	 ion 	 	of	a	new	particle	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	it	do	?
well	,	we	had	a	long	time	to	come	up	with	good	 analog 	 ies 	 	.
and	back	in	the	1980s	,	when	we	 want 	 ed 	 	the	money	for	the	lhc	from	the	u.k.	government	,	margaret	thatcher	,	at	the	time	,	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	if	you	 guy 	 s 	 	can	explain	,	in	language	a	 politic 	 ian 	 	can	understand	,	what	the	hell	it	is	that	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	,	you	can	have	the	money	.
i	want	to	know	what	 th 	 is 	 	higgs	particle	 do 	 es 	 	.	``
and	we	came	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	 analog 	 y 	 	,	and	it	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	work	.
well	,	what	the	higgs	 do 	 es 	 	is	,	it	 give 	 s 	 	mass	to	the	fundamental	 particle 	 s 	 	.
and	the	picture	is	that	the	whole	 uni 	 verse 	 	--	and	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	just	space	,	it	 mean 	 s 	 	me	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	and	 in 	 side 	 	you	--	the	whole	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	full	of	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	a	higgs	field	.
higgs	 particle 	 s 	 	,	if	you	will	.
the	 analog 	 y 	 	is	that	these	people	in	a	room	are	the	higgs	 particle 	 s 	 	.
now	when	a	particle	 move 	 s 	 	through	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	it	can	interact	with	these	higgs	 particle 	 s 	 	.
but	imagine	 some 	 one 	 	who	's	not	 ver 	 y 	 	popular	 move 	 s 	 	through	the	room	.
then	 every 	 one 	 	 ignor 	 es 	 	them	.	they	can	just	pass	through	the	room	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	 essential 	 ly 	 	at	the	speed	of	light	.	they	're	 mass 	 less 	 	.
and	imagine	 some 	 one 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	and	popular	and	intelligent	 walk 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	room	.
they	're	 surround 	 ed 	 	by	people	,	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 pass 	 age 	 	through	the	room	is	 impede 	 d 	 	.
it	's	 al 	 most 	 	like	they	get	heavy	.	they	get	massive	.
and	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	way	the	higgs	 mechan 	 ism 	 	 work 	 s 	 	.
the	picture	is	that	the	 electron 	 s 	 	and	the	 quar 	 k 	 s 	 	in	your	body	and	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	that	we	see	around	us	are	heavy	,	in	a	sense	,	and	massive	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 surround 	 ed 	 	by	higgs	 particle 	 s 	 	.
they	're	 interact 	 ing 	 	with	the	higgs	field	.
if	that	picture	's	true	,	then	we	have	to	discover	 t 	 hose 	 	higgs	 particle 	 s 	 	at	the	lhc	.
if	it	's	not	true	--	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	a	 con 	 volu 	 ted 	 	 mechan 	 ism 	 	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	it	's	the	 simpl 	 est 	 	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	think	of	--	then	 what 	 ever 	 	 do 	 es 	 	the	job	of	the	higgs	 particle 	 s 	 	we	know	have	to	turn	up	at	the	lhc	.
so	,	that	's	one	of	the	prime	 reason 	 s 	 	we	built	 th 	 is 	 	giant	machine	.
i	'm	glad	you	 recogn 	 ize 	 	margaret	thatcher	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	thought	about	making	it	more	 cultural 	 ly 	 	relevant	,	but	--	 any 	 way 	 	.
so	that	's	one	thing	.
that	's	 essential 	 ly 	 	a	guarantee	of	what	the	lhc	will	find	.
there	are	 man 	 y 	 	other	 thing 	 s 	 	.	you	've	heard	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	big	 problem 	 s 	 	in	particle	physics	.
one	of	them	you	heard	about	:	dark	matter	,	dark	energy	.
there	's	 an 	 other 	 	issue	,	which	is	that	the	 force 	 s 	 	in	nature	--	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	seem	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	go	back	in	time	,	they	seem	to	change	in	strength	.
well	,	they	do	change	in	strength	.
so	,	the	 electro 	 magnet 	 ic 	 	force	,	the	force	that	 hold 	 s 	 	us	together	,	 get 	 s 	 	 strong 	 er 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	go	to	 high 	 er 	 	 temperature 	 s 	 	.
the	strong	force	,	the	strong	nuclear	force	,	which	 stick 	 s 	 	nuclei	together	,	 get 	 s 	 	 weak 	 er 	 	.	and	what	you	see	is	the	standard	model	--	you	can	 calcul 	 ate 	 	how	these	change	--	is	the	 force 	 s 	 	,	the	three	 force 	 s 	 	,	other	than	 gravit 	 y 	 	,	 al 	 most 	 	seem	to	come	together	at	one	point	.
it	's	 al 	 most 	 	 a 	 s 	 	if	there	was	one	 beaut 	 iful 	 	kind	of	super	-	force	,	back	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	time	.
but	they	just	 mis 	 s 	 	.
now	there	's	a	 theor 	 y 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	super	-	symmetry	,	which	 double 	 s 	 	the	number	of	 particle 	 s 	 	in	the	standard	model	,
which	,	at	first	sight	,	 do 	 es 	 	n't	sound	like	a	 simpl 	 ification 	 	.
but	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	with	 th 	 is 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	,	we	find	that	the	 force 	 s 	 	of	nature	do	seem	to	 un 	 ify 	 	together	,	back	at	the	big	bang	--
 absolute 	 ly 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 prop 	 he 	 cy 	 	.	the	model	was	n't	built	to	do	that	,	but	it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	do	it	.
 al 	 so 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	super	-	symmetric	 particle 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	 candid 	 ates 	 	for	the	dark	matter	.
so	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 compel 	 ling 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 main 	 stream 	 	physics	.
and	if	i	was	to	put	money	on	it	,	i	would	put	money	on	--	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 scientific 	 	way	--	that	that	these	 thing 	 s 	 	would	 al 	 so 	 	crop	up	at	the	lhc	.
 man 	 y 	 	other	 thing 	 s 	 	that	the	lhc	could	discover	.
but	in	the	last	few	 minute 	 s 	 	,	i	just	want	to	give	you	a	different	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	of	what	i	think	--	what	particle	physics	 re 	 ally 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	to	me	--	particle	physics	and	 cosmo 	 logy 	 	.
and	that	's	that	i	think	it	's	 give 	 n 	 	us	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	narrative	--	 al 	 most 	 	a	creation	story	,	if	you	'd	like	--	about	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	from	modern	science	over	the	last	few	 decade 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'd	say	that	it	 deserve 	 s 	 	,	in	the	spirit	of	 wa 	 de 	 	davis	'	talk	,	to	be	at	 l 	 east 	 	put	up	there	with	these	 wonder 	 ful 	 	creation	 st 	 ories 	 	of	the	 people 	 s 	 	of	the	high	andes	and	the	 froze 	 n 	 	north	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	creation	story	,	i	think	,	 equal 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	.
the	story	 go 	 es 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	:	we	know	that	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	13.7	billion	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	in	an	 immense 	 ly 	 	hot	,	dense	state	,	much	 small 	 er 	 	than	a	single	atom	.
it	 beg 	 an 	 	to	expand	about	a	million	,	billion	,	billion	,	billion	 billion 	 th 	 	of	a	second	--	i	think	i	got	that	right	--	after	the	big	bang	.
 gravit 	 y 	 	 separat 	 ed 	 	away	from	the	other	 force 	 s 	 	.
the	 uni 	 verse 	 	then	 under 	 went 	 	an	exponential	expansion	 call 	 ed 	 	 infla 	 tion 	 	.
in	about	the	first	 billion 	 th 	 	of	a	second	or	so	,	the	higgs	field	 kick 	 ed 	 	in	,	and	the	 quar 	 k 	 s 	 	and	the	 glu 	 on 	 s 	 	and	the	 electron 	 s 	 	that	make	us	up	got	mass	.
the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 continu 	 ed 	 	to	expand	and	cool	.
after	about	a	few	 minute 	 s 	 	,	there	was	hydrogen	and	 hel 	 ium 	 	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.	that	's	all	.
the	 uni 	 verse 	 	was	about	75	percent	hydrogen	,	25	percent	 hel 	 ium 	 	.	it	still	is	 to 	 day 	 	.
it	 continu 	 ed 	 	to	expand	about	300	million	 year 	 s 	 	.
then	light	 beg 	 an 	 	to	travel	through	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
it	was	big	 en 	 ough 	 	to	be	 trans 	 parent 	 	to	light	,	and	that	's	what	we	see	in	the	 cosm 	 ic 	 	 micro 	 wave 	 	 back 	 ground 	 	that	george	smoot	 de 	 scribed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	looking	at	the	face	of	god	.
after	about	400	million	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	first	 star 	 s 	 	 form 	 ed 	 	,	and	that	hydrogen	,	that	 hel 	 ium 	 	,	then	 beg 	 an 	 	to	cook	 in 	 to 	 	the	 heav 	 ier 	 	 element 	 s 	 	.
so	the	 element 	 s 	 	of	life	--	carbon	,	and	oxygen	and	iron	,	all	the	 element 	 s 	 	that	we	need	to	make	us	up	--	 we 	 re 	 	 cook 	 ed 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	first	 generation 	 s 	 	of	 star 	 s 	 	,	which	then	ran	out	of	fuel	,	 explode 	 d 	 	,	threw	 t 	 hose 	 	 element 	 s 	 	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
they	then	re	-	 collapse 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 an 	 other 	 	generation	of	 star 	 s 	 	and	 planet 	 s 	 	.
and	on	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 planet 	 s 	 	,	the	oxygen	,	which	had	 be 	 en 	 	 create 	 d 	 	in	that	first	generation	of	 star 	 s 	 	,	could	fuse	with	hydrogen	to	form	water	,	liquid	water	on	the	surface	.
on	at	 l 	 east 	 	one	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 planet 	 s 	 	,	primitive	life	 evolv 	 ed 	 	,	which	 evolv 	 ed 	 	over	 million 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 walk 	 ed 	 	 up 	 right 	 	and	left	 foot 	 print 	 s 	 	about	three	and	a	half	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	in	the	mud	 flat 	 s 	 	of	tanzania	,	and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	left	a	 foot 	 print 	 	on	 an 	 other 	 	world	.
and	built	 th 	 is 	 	 civil 	 ization 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	picture	,	that	 turn 	 ed 	 	the	 dark 	 ness 	 	 in 	 to 	 	light	,	and	you	can	see	the	 civil 	 ization 	 	from	space	.
 a 	 s 	 	one	of	my	great	heroes	,	carl	sagan	,	 s 	 aid 	 	,	these	are	the	 thing 	 s 	 	--	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	these	,	but	i	was	looking	around	--	these	are	the	 thing 	 s 	 	,	like	saturn	v	 rocket 	 s 	 	,	and	sputnik	,	and	dna	,	and	 liter 	 ature 	 	and	science	--	these	are	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	hydrogen	 atom 	 s 	 	do	when	 give 	 n 	 	13.7	billion	 year 	 s 	 	.
 absolute 	 ly 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	.
and	,	the	 law 	 s 	 	of	physics	.	right	?
so	,	the	right	 law 	 s 	 	of	physics	--	they	're	 beaut 	 i 	 fully 	 	 balanc 	 ed 	 	.
if	the	weak	force	had	 be 	 en 	 	a	little	bit	different	,	then	carbon	and	oxygen	would	n't	be	 s 	 table 	 	 in 	 side 	 	the	 heart 	 s 	 	of	 star 	 s 	 	,	and	there	would	be	 non 	 e 	 	of	that	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
and	i	think	that	's	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	and	significant	story	.
50	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	could	n't	have	told	that	story	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	did	n't	know	it	.
it	 make 	 s 	 	me	 re 	 ally 	 	feel	that	that	 civil 	 ization 	 	--	which	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	say	,	if	you	 believ 	 e 	 	the	scientific	creation	story	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 emerge 	 d 	 	 pur 	 e 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	the	 law 	 s 	 	of	physics	,	and	a	few	hydrogen	 atom 	 s 	 	--	then	i	think	,	to	me	 any 	 way 	 	,	it	 make 	 s 	 	me	feel	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 valu 	 able 	 	.
so	that	's	the	lhc	.
the	lhc	is	 certain 	 ly 	 	,	when	it	 turn 	 s 	 	on	in	summer	,	going	to	write	the	next	chapter	of	that	book	.
and	i	'm	 certain 	 ly 	 	looking	forward	with	immense	 excit 	 ement 	 	to	it	 be 	 ing 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	on	.
 thank 	 s 	 	.
