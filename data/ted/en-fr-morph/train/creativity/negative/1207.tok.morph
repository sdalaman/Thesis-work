climate	change	is	 al 	 ready 	 	a	heavy	 top 	 ic 	 	,	and	it	's	 get 	 ting 	 	 heav 	 ier 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	 understand 	 ing 	 	that	we	need	to	do	more	than	we	are	.
we	're	 understand 	 ing 	 	,	in	fact	,	that	 t 	 hose 	 	of	us	who	live	in	the	 develop 	 ed 	 	world	need	to	be	 re 	 ally 	 	 push 	 ing 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 elimi 	 nating 	 	our	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	.
that	's	,	to	put	it	 mild 	 ly 	 	,	not	what	's	on	the	table	now	.
and	it	 tend 	 s 	 	to	feel	a	little	 overwhelm 	 ing 	 	when	we	look	at	what	is	there	in	 re 	 ality 	 	 to 	 day 	 	and	the	 magn 	 itude 	 	of	the	problem	that	we	face	.
and	when	we	have	 overwhelm 	 ing 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	in	front	of	us	,	we	tend	to	seek	simple	 answer 	 s 	 	.
and	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	with	climate	change	.
we	look	at	where	the	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	are	coming	from	--	they	're	coming	out	of	our	 tail 	 pipe 	 s 	 	and	 smoke 	 stack 	 s 	 	and	so	forth	,	and	we	say	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	well	the	problem	is	that	they	're	coming	out	of	fossil	 fuel 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 burn 	 ing 	 	,	so	 there 	 fore 	 	,	the	answer	must	be	to	replace	 t 	 hose 	 	fossil	 fuel 	 s 	 	with	clean	 source 	 s 	 	of	energy	.	and	while	,	of	course	,	we	do	need	clean	energy	,	i	would	put	to	you	that	it	's	possible	that	by	looking	at	climate	change	 a 	 s 	 	a	clean	energy	generation	problem	,	we	're	in	fact	setting	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	up	not	to	solve	it	.	and	the	reason	why	is	that	we	live	on	a	planet	that	is	 rapid 	 ly 	 	 urban 	 izing 	 	.
that	should	n't	be	news	to	any	of	us	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	it	's	hard	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	to	remember	the	 ex 	 tent 	 	of	that	 urban 	 ization 	 	.
by	mid	-	century	,	we	're	going	to	have	about	eight	billion	--	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	more	--	people	living	in	cities	or	 with 	 in 	 	a	day	's	travel	of	one	.
we	will	be	an	 overwhelm 	 ing 	 ly 	 	urban	species	.
in	order	to	provide	the	kind	of	energy	that	it	would	take	for	eight	billion	people	living	in	cities	that	are	even	 some 	 what 	 	like	the	cities	that	 t 	 hose 	 	of	us	in	the	global	north	live	in	 to 	 day 	 	,	we	would	have	to	generate	an	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 astonish 	 ing 	 	amount	of	energy	.
it	may	be	possible	that	we	are	not	even	able	to	build	that	much	clean	energy	.
so	if	we	're	 serious 	 ly 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 tack 	 ling 	 	climate	change	on	an	 urban 	 izing 	 	planet	,	we	need	to	look	 some 	 where 	 	else	for	the	solution	.
the	solution	,	in	fact	,	may	be	 close 	 r 	 	to	hand	than	we	think	,
 be 	 cause 	 	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	cities	we	're	building	are	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	.
every	city	 determine 	 s 	 	to	a	 ver 	 y 	 	large	 ex 	 tent 	 	the	amount	of	energy	used	by	 it 	 s 	 	 inhabit 	 ants 	 	.
we	tend	to	think	of	energy	use	 a 	 s 	 	a	 behavior 	 al 	 	thing	--	i	 choos 	 e 	 	to	turn	 th 	 is 	 	light	 s 	 witch 	 	on	--	but	 re 	 ally 	 	,	enormous	 amount 	 s 	 	of	our	energy	use	are	 pre 	 destined 	 	by	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 commun 	 ities 	 	and	cities	that	we	live	in	.
i	wo	n't	show	you	 ver 	 y 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 graph 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	but	if	i	can	just	focus	on	 th 	 is 	 	one	for	a	moment	,	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	us	a	lot	of	what	we	need	to	know	--	which	is	,	 quit 	 e 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	,	that	if	you	look	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	at	 transport 	 ation 	 	,	a	major	 categor 	 y 	 	of	climate	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	,	there	is	a	direct	relationship	between	how	dense	a	city	is	and	the	amount	of	climate	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	that	 it 	 s 	 	 resident 	 s 	 	spew	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	air	.
and	the	correlation	,	of	course	,	is	that	 den 	 s 	 er 	 	 place 	 s 	 	tend	to	have	lower	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	--	which	is	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	all	that	difficult	to	figure	out	,	if	you	think	about	it	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	,	we	 substitut 	 e 	 	,	in	our	 live 	 s 	 	,	access	to	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	want	.
we	go	out	there	and	we	hop	in	our	 car 	 s 	 	and	we	drive	from	place	to	place	.
and	we	're	 bas 	 ically 	 	using	 mobil 	 ity 	 	to	get	the	access	we	need	.
but	when	we	live	in	a	 den 	 s 	 er 	 	community	,	 sudden 	 ly 	 	what	we	find	,	of	course	,	is	that	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	need	are	close	by	.
and	since	the	most	 sustain 	 able 	 	trip	is	the	one	that	you	never	had	to	make	in	the	first	place	,	 sudden 	 ly 	 	our	 live 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 instant 	 ly 	 	more	 sustain 	 able 	 	.
and	it	is	possible	,	of	course	,	to	 in 	 crease 	 	the	density	of	the	 commun 	 ities 	 	around	us	.
some	 place 	 s 	 	are	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	with	new	eco	 di 	 strict 	 s 	 	,	 develop 	 ing 	 	whole	new	 sustain 	 able 	 	 neighbor 	 hood 	 s 	 	,	which	is	nice	work	if	you	can	get	it	,
but	most	of	the	time	,	what	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	is	,	in	fact	,	 re 	 weaving 	 	the	urban	fabric	that	we	 al 	 ready 	 	have	.
so	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 in 	 fill 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	:	 re 	 ally 	 	sharp	little	 change 	 s 	 	to	where	we	have	 building 	 s 	 	,	where	we	're	 develop 	 ing 	 	.
urban	 retro 	 fitting 	 	:	creating	different	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 space 	 s 	 	and	uses	out	of	 place 	 s 	 	that	are	 al 	 ready 	 	there	.
 increasing 	 ly 	 	,	we	're	 real 	 izing 	 	that	we	do	n't	even	need	to	 den 	 s 	 ify 	 	an	entire	city	.
what	we	need	 in 	 stead 	 	is	an	average	density	that	 rise 	 s 	 	to	a	level	where	we	do	n't	drive	 a 	 s 	 	much	and	so	on	.
and	that	can	be	 d 	 one 	 	by	raising	the	density	in	 ver 	 y 	 	specific	 spot 	 s 	 	a	whole	lot	.
so	you	can	think	of	it	 a 	 s 	 	tent	 pole 	 s 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	raise	the	density	of	the	entire	city	.
and	we	find	that	when	we	do	that	,	we	can	,	in	fact	,	have	a	few	 place 	 s 	 	that	are	 re 	 ally 	 	hyper	-	dense	 with 	 in 	 	a	 wide 	 r 	 	fabric	of	 place 	 s 	 	that	are	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	a	little	more	 comfort 	 able 	 	and	 achiev 	 e 	 	the	same	 result 	 s 	 	.
now	we	may	find	that	there	are	 place 	 s 	 	that	are	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	dense	and	still	hold	onto	 the 	 ir 	 	 car 	 s 	 	,	but	the	 re 	 ality 	 	is	that	,	by	and	large	,	what	we	see	when	we	get	a	lot	of	people	together	with	the	right	 condition 	 s 	 	is	a	threshold	effect	,	where	people	 simpl 	 y 	 	stop	 driv 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	,	and	 increasing 	 ly 	 	,	more	and	more	people	,	if	they	're	 surround 	 ed 	 	by	 place 	 s 	 	that	make	them	feel	at	home	,	give	up	 the 	 ir 	 	 car 	 s 	 	 al 	 together 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	huge	,	huge	energy	 saving 	 s 	 	,
 be 	 cause 	 	what	 come 	 s 	 	out	of	our	 tail 	 pipe 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	just	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	story	with	climate	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	from	 car 	 s 	 	.
we	have	the	 manufactur 	 e 	 	of	the	car	,	the	 dispos 	 al 	 	of	the	car	,	all	of	the	 park 	 ing 	 	and	 free 	 ways 	 	and	so	on	.
when	you	can	get	rid	of	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 some 	 body 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	use	any	of	them	 re 	 ally 	 	,	you	find	that	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	cut	 transport 	 ation 	 	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	90	percent	.
and	people	are	 em 	 bracing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
all	around	the	world	,	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	more	and	more	people	embrace	 th 	 is 	 	 walk 	 shed 	 	life	.
people	are	 say 	 ing 	 	that	it	's	moving	from	the	idea	of	the	dream	home	to	the	dream	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	.
and	when	you	layer	that	over	with	the	kind	of	 ubiqu 	 it 	 ous 	 	 communication 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	see	,	what	you	find	is	,	in	fact	,	even	more	access	 suff 	 used 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 space 	 s 	 	.
some	of	it	's	 transport 	 ation 	 	access	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	mapnificent	map	that	 show 	 s 	 	me	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	how	far	i	can	get	from	my	home	in	30	 minute 	 s 	 	using	public	 transport 	 ation 	 	.
some	of	it	is	about	 walk 	 ing 	 	.	it	's	not	all	perfect	yet	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	google	 walk 	 ing 	 	 map 	 s 	 	.
i	 ask 	 ed 	 	how	to	do	the	 great 	 er 	 	ridgeway	,	and	it	told	me	to	go	via	guernsey	.
it	did	tell	me	that	 th 	 is 	 	route	 may 	 be 	 	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	 side 	 walk 	 s 	 	or	pedestrian	 path 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	.
but	the	 techno 	 logies 	 	are	 get 	 ting 	 	better	,	and	we	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	 re 	 ally 	 	kind	of	 crowd 	 source 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 navig 	 ation 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	we	just	heard	 ear 	 lier 	 	,	of	course	,	we	're	 al 	 so 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	how	to	put	information	on	dumb	 object 	 s 	 	.
 thing 	 s 	 	that	do	n't	have	any	wiring	in	them	at	all	,	we	're	 learn 	 ing 	 	how	to	include	in	these	 system 	 s 	 	of	 not 	 ation 	 	and	 navig 	 ation 	 	.
part	of	what	we	're	 find 	 ing 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	what	we	thought	was	the	major	point	of	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	and	consumption	,	which	is	to	get	a	bunch	of	stuff	,	is	not	,	in	fact	,	how	we	 re 	 ally 	 	live	best	in	dense	 environment 	 s 	 	.
what	we	're	 find 	 ing 	 	is	that	what	we	want	is	access	to	the	 cap 	 a 	 cities 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	is	a	drill	.	who	here	 own 	 s 	 	a	drill	,	a	home	power	drill	?
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	i	do	too	.
the	average	home	power	drill	is	used	 some 	 where 	 	between	six	and	20	 minute 	 s 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	entire	 life 	 time 	 	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	who	you	ask	.
and	so	what	we	do	is	we	buy	these	 drill 	 s 	 	that	have	a	potential	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 hour 	 s 	 	of	drill	time	,	use	them	once	or	twice	to	put	a	hole	in	the	wall	and	let	them	 s 	 it 	 	.
our	cities	,	i	would	put	to	you	,	are	 stock 	 pile 	 s 	 	of	these	 sur 	 plus 	 	 cap 	 a 	 cities 	 	.
and	while	we	could	try	and	figure	out	new	ways	to	use	 t 	 hose 	 	 cap 	 a 	 cities 	 	--	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 cook 	 ing 	 	or	making	ice	 sculpt 	 ures 	 	or	even	a	mafia	hit	--	what	we	 prob 	 ably 	 	will	find	is	that	,	in	fact	,	 turn 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 product 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 service 	 s 	 	that	we	have	access	to	when	we	want	them	,	is	a	far	 smart 	 er 	 	way	to	go	.
and	in	fact	,	even	space	 it 	 self 	 	is	 turn 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	service	.
we	're	 find 	 ing 	 	that	people	can	share	the	same	 space 	 s 	 	,	do	stuff	with	 vac 	 ant 	 	space	.
 building 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 coming 	 	 bundl 	 es 	 	of	 service 	 s 	 	.
so	we	have	new	 design 	 s 	 	that	are	 help 	 ing 	 	us	take	 mechanic 	 al 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	used	to	 s 	 pend 	 	energy	on	--	like	 heat 	 ing 	 	,	 cool 	 ing 	 	etc	.	--	and	turn	them	 in 	 to 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	avoid	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	energy	on	.
so	we	light	our	 building 	 s 	 	with	 day 	 light 	 	.
we	cool	them	with	 breeze 	 s 	 	.	we	heat	them	with	 s 	 un 	 shine 	 	.
in	fact	,	when	we	use	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	what	we	've	found	is	that	,	in	some	 case 	 s 	 	,	energy	use	in	a	building	can	drop	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	90	percent	.	which	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	on	 an 	 other 	 	threshold	effect	i	like	to	call	furnace	 dump 	 ing 	 	,
which	is	,	 quit 	 e 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	,	if	you	have	a	building	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	need	to	be	heated	with	a	furnace	,	you	 s 	 ave 	 	a	whole	bunch	of	money	up	front	.
these	 thing 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 cheap 	 er 	 	to	build	than	the	 alter 	 native 	 s 	 	.
now	when	we	look	at	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	 s 	 lash 	 	our	product	use	,	 s 	 lash 	 	our	 transport 	 ation 	 	use	,	 s 	 lash 	 	our	building	energy	use	,	all	of	that	is	great	,	but	it	still	 leav 	 es 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	.
and	if	we	're	going	to	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 tru 	 ly 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 sustain 	 able 	 	cities	,	we	need	to	think	a	little	 different 	 ly 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	way	to	do	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	vancouver	's	 propag 	 and 	 a 	 	about	how	green	a	city	they	are	.
and	 certain 	 ly 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	people	have	taken	to	heart	 th 	 is 	 	idea	that	a	 sustain 	 able 	 	city	is	 cover 	 ed 	 	in	 green 	 ery 	 	.
so	we	have	 vision 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
we	have	 vision 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.	we	have	 vision 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
now	all	of	these	are	fine	 project 	 s 	 	,	but	they	 re 	 ally 	 	have	 mis 	 s 	 ed 	 	an	essential	point	,	which	is	it	's	not	about	the	 leav 	 es 	 	above	,	it	's	about	the	 system 	 s 	 	 be 	 low 	 	.
do	they	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	capture	 rain 	 water 	 	so	that	we	can	 reduc 	 e 	 	water	use	?
water	is	energy	intensive	.
do	they	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	include	green	 infra 	 structure 	 	,	so	that	we	can	take	 run 	 off 	 	and	water	that	's	going	out	of	our	 house 	 s 	 	and	clean	it	and	filter	it	and	grow	urban	street	 tree 	 s 	 	?
do	they	connect	us	back	to	the	 eco 	 system 	 s 	 	around	us	by	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 connect 	 ing 	 	us	to	 river 	 s 	 	and	 allow 	 ing 	 	for	 resto 	 ration 	 	?
do	they	allow	for	 pollinat 	 ion 	 	,	 pollinat 	 or 	 	 path 	 ways 	 	that	bees	and	 butter 	 flies 	 	and	 s 	 uch 	 	can	come	back	 in 	 to 	 	our	cities	?
do	they	even	take	the	 ver 	 y 	 	waste	matter	that	we	have	from	food	and	fiber	and	so	forth	,
and	turn	it	back	 in 	 to 	 	 s 	 oil 	 	and	 sequest 	 er 	 	carbon	--	take	carbon	out	of	the	air	in	the	process	of	using	our	cities	?
i	would	submit	to	you	that	all	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	not	 on 	 ly 	 	possible	,	they	're	 be 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	right	now	,	and	that	it	's	a	darn	good	thing	.
 be 	 cause 	 	right	now	,	our	 eco 	 nomy 	 	by	and	large	 oper 	 ates 	 	 a 	 s 	 	paul	hawken	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	by	 steal 	 ing 	 	the	future	,	selling	it	in	the	present	and	 call 	 ing 	 	it	gdp	.	``
and	if	we	have	 an 	 other 	 	eight	billion	or	seven	billion	,	or	six	billion	,	even	,	people	,	living	on	a	planet	where	 the 	 ir 	 	cities	 al 	 so 	 	steal	the	future	,	we	're	going	to	run	out	of	future	 re 	 ally 	 	fast	.
but	if	we	think	 different 	 ly 	 	,	i	think	that	,	in	fact	,	we	can	have	cities	that	are	not	 on 	 ly 	 	zero	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	,	but	have	 un 	 limit 	 ed 	 	 possibil 	 ities 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
