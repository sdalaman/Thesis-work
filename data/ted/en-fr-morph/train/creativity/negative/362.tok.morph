i	want	to	take	you	back	 bas 	 ically 	 	to	my	 home 	 town 	 	,	and	to	a	picture	of	my	 home 	 town 	 	of	the	week	that	``	emergence	``	came	out	.
and	it	's	a	picture	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 time 	 s 	 	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	,	``	emergence	``	was	 publish 	 ed 	 	on	9/11	.
i	live	right	there	in	the	west	village	,	so	the	plume	was	 luck 	 ily 	 	 blow 	 ing 	 	west	,	away	from	us	.
we	had	a	two	-	and	-	a	-	half	-	day	-	old	baby	in	the	house	that	was	 our 	 s 	 	--	we	had	n't	taken	it	from	 some 	 body 	 	else	.
and	one	of	the	 thought 	 s 	 	that	i	had	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	these	two	 separat 	 e 	 	 emergence 	 s 	 	of	a	book	and	a	baby	,	and	 hav 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	event	happen	so	close	--	that	my	first	thought	,	when	i	was	still	kind	of	in	the	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	looking	out	at	it	all	or	 walk 	 ing 	 	out	on	the	street	and	looking	out	on	it	just	in	front	of	our	building	,	was	that	i	'd	made	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	 mis 	 calcul 	 ation 	 	in	the	book	that	i	'd	just	written	.
 be 	 cause 	 	so	much	of	that	book	was	a	 celebr 	 ation 	 	of	the	power	and	creative	potential	of	density	,	of	 large 	 ly 	 	urban	density	,	of	 connect 	 ing 	 	people	and	 put 	 ting 	 	them	together	in	one	place	,	and	 put 	 ting 	 	them	on	 side 	 walk 	 s 	 	together	and	 hav 	 ing 	 	them	share	 idea 	 s 	 	and	share	physical	space	together	.
and	it	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	me	looking	at	that	--	that	tower	 burn 	 ing 	 	and	then	 fall 	 ing 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 tower 	 s 	 	 burn 	 ing 	 	and	 fall 	 ing 	 	--	that	in	fact	,	one	of	the	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	here	was	that	density	 kill 	 s 	 	.
and	that	of	all	the	 techno 	 logies 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 exploit 	 ed 	 	to	make	that	 car 	 n 	 age 	 	come	 in 	 to 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	single	group	of	 techno 	 logies 	 	that	cost	the	most	 live 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	that	 en 	 able 	 	50,000	people	to	live	in	two	 building 	 s 	 	110	 st 	 ories 	 	above	the	ground	.
if	they	had	n't	 be 	 en 	 	 crowd 	 ed 	 	--	you	 compar 	 e 	 	the	loss	of	life	at	the	 pent 	 agon 	 	to	the	 t 	 win 	 	 tower 	 s 	 	,	and	you	can	see	that	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 fully 	 	.
and	so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	think	,	well	,	you	know	,	density	,	density	--	i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	if	,	you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	right	call	.
and	i	kind	of	 rumi 	 nated 	 	on	that	for	a	couple	of	 day 	 s 	 	.
and	then	about	two	 day 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	the	wind	 start 	 ed 	 	to	change	a	little	bit	,	and	you	could	sense	that	the	air	was	not	 health 	 y 	 	.
and	so	even	 th 	 ough 	 	there	 we 	 re 	 	no	 car 	 s 	 	still	in	the	west	village	where	we	lived	,	my	wife	 s 	 ent 	 	me	out	to	buy	a	,	you	know	,	a	large	air	filter	at	the	bed	bath	and	beyond	,	which	was	 locate 	 d 	 	about	20	 block 	 s 	 	away	,	north	.
and	so	i	went	out	.
and	 obvious 	 ly 	 	i	'm	 physical 	 ly 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	person	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	tell	--	--	so	i	was	n't	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	 carry 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	thing	20	 block 	 s 	 	.
and	i	 walk 	 ed 	 	out	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 miracul 	 ous 	 	thing	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	me	 a 	 s 	 	i	was	 walk 	 ing 	 	north	to	buy	 th 	 is 	 	air	filter	,	which	was	that	the	 street 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	 al 	 ive 	 	with	people	.
there	was	an	 in 	 credible 	 	--	it	was	,	you	know	,	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	day	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	was	for	about	a	week	after	,	and	the	west	village	had	never	 seem 	 ed 	 	more	 live 	 ly 	 	.
i	 walk 	 ed 	 	up	 a 	 long 	 	hudson	street	--	where	jane	jacobs	had	lived	and	written	her	great	book	that	so	 influence 	 d 	 	what	i	was	writing	in	``	emergence	``	--	past	the	white	horse	tavern	,	that	great	old	bar	where	dylan	thomas	 d 	 rank 	 	 him 	 self 	 	to	death	,	and	the	bleecker	street	 play 	 ground 	 	was	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	 kid 	 s 	 	.
and	all	the	people	who	lived	in	the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	,	who	owned	 restaurant 	 s 	 	and	 bar 	 s 	 	in	the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	,	 we 	 re 	 	all	out	there	--	had	them	all	open	.
people	 we 	 re 	 	out	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	no	 car 	 s 	 	,	so	it	 seem 	 ed 	 	even	better	,	in	some	ways	.
and	it	was	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	urban	day	,	and	the	 in 	 credible 	 	thing	about	it	was	that	the	city	was	 work 	 ing 	 	.
the	city	was	there	.
all	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	make	a	great	city	 success 	 ful 	 	and	all	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	make	a	great	city	 stimul 	 ating 	 	--	they	 we 	 re 	 	all	on	 dis 	 play 	 	there	on	 t 	 hose 	 	 street 	 s 	 	.
and	i	thought	,	well	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	power	of	a	city	.
i	mean	,	the	power	of	the	city	--	we	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	cities	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 central 	 ized 	 	in	space	,	but	what	 make 	 s 	 	them	so	strong	most	of	the	time	is	they	're	 de 	 central 	 ized 	 	in	function	.
they	do	n't	have	a	center	 ex 	 ecutive 	 	branch	that	you	can	take	out	and	cause	the	whole	thing	to	fail	.
if	they	did	,	it	 prob 	 ably 	 	was	right	there	at	ground	zero	.
i	mean	,	you	know	,	the	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	 bunk 	 er 	 	was	right	there	,	was	 destroy 	 ed 	 	by	the	 attack 	 s 	 	,	and	 obvious 	 ly 	 	the	damage	 d 	 one 	 	to	the	building	and	the	 live 	 s 	 	.
but	 non 	 e 	 the 	 less 	 	,	just	20	 block 	 s 	 	north	,	two	 day 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	the	city	had	never	 look 	 ed 	 	more	 al 	 ive 	 	.
if	you	'd	gone	 in 	 to 	 	the	 mind 	 s 	 	of	the	people	,	well	,	you	would	have	 s 	 een 	 	a	lot	of	trauma	,	and	you	would	have	 s 	 een 	 	a	lot	of	 heart 	 ache 	 	,	and	you	would	have	 s 	 een 	 	a	lot	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	would	take	a	long	time	to	 re 	 cover 	 	.
but	the	system	 it 	 self 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	city	was	 thriv 	 ing 	 	.
so	i	took	heart	in	 see 	 ing 	 	that	.
so	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	talk	a	little	bit	about	the	 reason 	 s 	 	why	that	 work 	 s 	 	so	well	,	and	how	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	kind	of	map	on	to	where	the	web	is	going	right	now	.
the	question	that	i	found	 my 	 self 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	to	people	when	i	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	book	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	is	--	when	you	've	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	 emerge 	 nt 	 	behavior	,	when	you	've	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	 collect 	 ive 	 	 intellig 	 ence 	 	,	the	best	way	to	get	people	to	kind	of	wrap	 the 	 ir 	 	 head 	 s 	 	around	that	is	to	ask	,	who	 build 	 s 	 	a	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	?
who	 decide 	 s 	 	that	soho	should	have	 th 	 is 	 	 personal 	 ity 	 	and	that	the	latin	quarter	should	have	 th 	 is 	 	 personal 	 ity 	 	?
well	,	there	are	some	kind	of	 ex 	 ecutive 	 	 decision 	 s 	 	,	but	 most 	 ly 	 	the	answer	is	--	 every 	 body 	 	and	 no 	 body 	 	.
 every 	 body 	 	 con 	 tribute 	 s 	 	a	little	bit	.
no	single	person	is	 re 	 ally 	 	the	ultimate	 a 	 ctor 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	the	 personal 	 ity 	 	of	a	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	.
same	thing	to	the	question	of	,	who	was	 keep 	 ing 	 	the	 street 	 s 	 	 al 	 ive 	 	post	-	9/11	in	my	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	?
well	,	it	was	the	whole	city	.
the	whole	system	kind	of	 work 	 ing 	 	on	it	,	and	 every 	 body 	 	 con 	 trib 	 uting 	 	a	small	little	part	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 increasing 	 ly 	 	what	we	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	see	on	the	web	in	a	bunch	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	ways	--
most	of	which	 we 	 re 	 	n't	around	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	in	 ver 	 y 	 	 experiment 	 al 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	when	i	was	writing	``	emergence	``	and	when	the	book	came	out	.
so	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 optimist 	 ic 	 	time	,	i	think	,	and	i	want	to	just	talk	about	a	few	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
i	think	that	there	is	 effective 	 ly 	 	a	new	kind	of	model	of	 inter 	 activity 	 	that	's	 start 	 ing 	 	to	emerge	 on 	 line 	 	right	now	.
and	the	old	one	 look 	 ed 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	the	future	king	of	england	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	it	.
it	's	some	guy	,	it	's	a	geocities	 home 	 page 	 	of	some	guy	that	i	found	 on 	 line 	 	who	's	 interest 	 ed 	 	,	if	you	look	at	the	bottom	,	in	soccer	and	jesus	and	garth	brooks	and	clint	beckham	and	``	my	 home 	 town 	 	``	--	 t 	 hose 	 	are	his	 link 	 s 	 	.
but	 noth 	 ing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 say 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	model	of	 inter 	 activity 	 	--	which	was	so	 excit 	 ing 	 	and	 capture 	 s 	 	the	real	,	the	web	 zeitge 	 ist 	 	of	1995	--	than	``	click	here	for	a	picture	of	my	dog	.	``
that	is	--	you	know	,	there	's	no	sentence	that	kind	of	 conjure 	 s 	 	up	that	period	better	than	that	,	i	think	,	which	is	that	you	 sudden 	 ly 	 	have	the	power	to	put	up	a	picture	of	your	dog	and	link	to	it	,	and	 some 	 body 	 	 read 	 ing 	 	the	page	 ha 	 s 	 	the	power	to	click	on	that	link	or	not	click	on	that	link	.
and	,	you	know	,	i	do	n't	want	to	 be 	 little 	 	that	.	that	,	in	a	sense	--	to	 re 	 ference 	 	what	jeff	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 yester 	 day 	 	--	that	was	,	in	a	sense	,	the	kind	of	 inter 	 face 	 	 electric 	 ity 	 	that	powered	a	lot	of	the	explosion	of	interest	in	the	web	:	that	you	could	put	up	a	link	,	and	 some 	 body 	 	could	click	on	it	,	and	it	could	take	you	 any 	 where 	 	you	 want 	 ed 	 	to	go	.
but	it	's	still	a	 ver 	 y 	 	one	-	to	-	one	kind	of	relationship	.
there	's	one	person	 put 	 ting 	 	up	the	link	,	and	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	person	on	the	other	end	 try 	 ing 	 	to	decide	 whet 	 her 	 	to	click	on	it	or	not	.
the	new	model	is	much	more	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	we	've	 al 	 ready 	 	 s 	 een 	 	a	couple	of	 re 	 ference 	 s 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	you	search	``	steven	johnson	``	on	google	.
about	two	 month 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	had	the	great	 break 	 through 	 	--	one	of	my	great	,	kind	of	 shin 	 ing 	 	 achiev 	 ement 	 s 	 	--	which	is	that	my	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	 final 	 ly 	 	 be 	 came 	 	a	top	result	for	``	steven	johnson	.	``
there	's	some	 theoretic 	 al 	 	physicist	at	mit	named	steven	johnson	who	 ha 	 s 	 	 drop 	 ped 	 	two	 spot 	 s 	 	,	i	'm	happy	to	say	.
and	,	you	know	,	i	mean	,	i	'll	look	at	a	couple	of	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	google	is	 obvious 	 ly 	 	the	 great 	 est 	 	technology	ever	 invent 	 ed 	 	for	 nav 	 el 	 	 gaz 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	just	that	there	are	so	 man 	 y 	 	other	people	in	your	 nav 	 el 	 	when	you	 gaz 	 e 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 effective 	 ly 	 	,	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	here	,	what	's	creating	 th 	 is 	 	page	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	--	and	we	all	know	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	it	's	worth	just	 think 	 ing 	 	about	it	--	is	not	some	person	 dec 	 id 	 ing 	 	that	i	am	the	number	one	answer	for	steven	johnson	,	but	 ra 	 ther 	 	 some 	 how 	 	the	entire	web	of	people	 put 	 ting 	 	up	 page 	 s 	 	and	 dec 	 id 	 ing 	 	to	link	to	my	page	or	not	link	to	it	,	and	google	just	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	and	running	the	 number 	 s 	 	.
so	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	 collect 	 ive 	 	decision	-	making	that	's	going	on	.
 th 	 is 	 	page	is	 effective 	 ly 	 	,	 collect 	 ively 	 	 author 	 ed 	 	by	the	web	,	and	google	is	just	 help 	 ing 	 	us	kind	of	to	put	the	 author 	 ship 	 	in	one	kind	of	 cohere 	 nt 	 	place	.
now	,	they	're	more	 innov 	 ative 	 	--	well	,	google	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	 innov 	 ative 	 	--	but	there	are	some	new	 twist 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
there	's	 th 	 is 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	new	 s 	 ite 	 	--	technorati	--	that	's	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	 lot 	 s 	 	of	little	 widget 	 s 	 	that	are	 expand 	 ing 	 	on	these	.
and	these	are	looking	in	the	blog	world	and	the	world	of	 web 	 log 	 s 	 	.
he	's	 analyz 	 ed 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	all	the	 web 	 log 	 s 	 	out	there	that	he	's	 track 	 ing 	 	.
and	he	's	 track 	 ing 	 	how	 man 	 y 	 	other	 web 	 log 	 s 	 	linked	to	 t 	 hose 	 	 web 	 log 	 s 	 	,	and	so	you	have	kind	of	an	 author 	 ity 	 	--	a	 web 	 log 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	 link 	 s 	 	to	it	is	more	 author 	 itative 	 	than	a	 web 	 log 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	few	 link 	 s 	 	to	it	.
and	so	at	any	 give 	 n 	 	time	,	on	any	 give 	 n 	 	page	on	the	web	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	you	can	say	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	the	 web 	 log 	 	community	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	page	?
and	you	can	get	a	list	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	they	think	about	my	 s 	 ite 	 	;	it	's	 rank 	 ed 	 	by	blog	 author 	 ity 	 	.
you	can	 al 	 so 	 	rank	it	by	the	 lat 	 est 	 	 post 	 s 	 	.
so	when	i	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	in	``	emergence	,	``	i	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	the	 limit 	 ations 	 	of	the	one	-	way	 link 	 ing 	 	 architect 	 ure 	 	that	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	you	could	link	to	 some 	 body 	 	else	but	they	would	n't	 necess 	 arily 	 	know	that	you	 we 	 re 	 	 point 	 ing 	 	to	them	.
and	that	was	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	why	the	web	was	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 emerge 	 nt 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	could	be	 be 	 cause 	 	you	 need 	 ed 	 	two	-	way	 link 	 ing 	 	,	you	 need 	 ed 	 	that	kind	of	 feed 	 back 	 	 mechan 	 ism 	 	to	be	able	to	 re 	 ally 	 	do	 interest 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
well	,	 some 	 thing 	 	like	technorati	is	 supply 	 ing 	 	that	.
now	what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	here	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	quote	from	dave	weinberger	,	where	he	 talk 	 s 	 	about	 every 	 thing 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 purpos 	 ive 	 	in	the	web	--	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	artificial	.
he	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	line	where	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	you	're	going	to	put	up	a	link	there	,	if	you	see	a	link	,	 some 	 body 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	to	put	it	there	.
and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	the	link	to	one	 s 	 ite 	 	did	n't	just	grow	on	the	other	page	``	like	a	tree	fungus	.	``
and	in	fact	,	i	think	that	's	not	 entire 	 ly 	 	true	 any 	 more 	 	.
i	could	put	up	a	feed	of	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 link 	 s 	 	generated	by	technorati	on	the	right	-	hand	side	of	my	page	,	and	they	would	change	 a 	 s 	 	the	 over 	 all 	 	 eco 	 logy 	 	of	the	web	 change 	 s 	 	.
that	little	list	there	would	change	.
i	would	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	be	 direct 	 ly 	 	in	control	of	it	.
so	it	's	much	 close 	 r 	 	,	in	a	way	,	to	a	data	fungus	,	in	a	sense	,	 wrap 	 ped 	 	around	that	page	,	than	it	is	to	a	 de 	 liberate 	 	link	that	i	've	 place 	 d 	 	there	.
now	,	what	you	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	here	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	a	global	brain	that	you	're	able	to	do	 lot 	 s 	 	of	kind	of	 experiment 	 s 	 	on	to	see	what	it	's	 think 	 ing 	 	.
and	there	are	all	these	 interest 	 ing 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	.
google	 do 	 es 	 	the	google	 zeitge 	 ist 	 	,	which	 look 	 s 	 	at	search	 request 	 s 	 	to	test	what	's	going	on	,	what	people	are	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	,	and	they	publish	it	with	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 f 	 un 	 	 graph 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	nice	 thing 	 s 	 	about	google	,	so	i	'll	be	i	'll	be	 say 	 ing 	 	one	little	critical	thing	.
there	's	a	problem	with	the	google	 zeitge 	 ist 	 	,	which	is	it	often	 come 	 s 	 	back	with	news	that	a	lot	of	people	are	 search 	 ing 	 	for	britney	 spear 	 s 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	,	which	is	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	news	.
the	columbia	 blow 	 s 	 	up	,	 sudden 	 ly 	 	there	are	a	lot	of	 search 	 es 	 	on	columbia	.
well	,	you	know	,	we	should	expect	to	see	that	.
that	's	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	we	did	n't	know	 al 	 ready 	 	.
so	the	key	thing	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	these	new	 tool 	 s 	 	that	are	kind	of	 plumb 	 ing 	 	the	 depth 	 s 	 	of	the	global	brain	,	that	are	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	kind	of	trace	 dye 	 s 	 	through	that	whole	 blood 	 stream 	 	--	the	question	is	,	are	you	 find 	 ing 	 	out	 some 	 thing 	 	new	?
and	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	 experiment 	 ed 	 	with	is	 th 	 is 	 	thing	 call 	 ed 	 	google	share	which	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	you	take	an	abstract	term	,	and	you	search	google	for	that	term	,	and	then	you	search	the	 result 	 s 	 	that	you	get	back	for	 some 	 body 	 	's	name	.
so	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	the	number	of	 page 	 s 	 	that	 ment 	 ion 	 	 th 	 is 	 	term	,	that	 al 	 so 	 	 ment 	 ion 	 	 th 	 is 	 	page	,	the	 percent 	 age 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 page 	 s 	 	is	that	person	's	google	share	of	that	term	.
so	you	can	do	kind	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	 contest 	 s 	 	.
like	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	google	share	of	the	ted	 con 	 ference 	 	.
so	richard	saul	wurman	 ha 	 s 	 	about	a	15	percent	google	share	of	the	ted	 con 	 ference 	 	.
but	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	is	,	you	can	 broad 	 en 	 	the	search	a	little	bit	.
and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	that	42	percent	is	the	mola	mola	fish	.
i	had	no	idea	.
no	,	that	's	not	true	.
i	made	that	up	 be 	 cause 	 	i	just	 want 	 ed 	 	to	put	up	a	slide	of	the	mola	mola	fish	.
i	 al 	 so 	 	did	--	and	i	do	n't	want	to	start	a	little	fight	in	the	next	 pan 	 el 	 	--	but	i	did	a	google	share	analysis	of	evolution	and	natural	 s 	 election 	 	.
so	right	here	--	now	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	big	 categor 	 y 	 	,	you	have	 small 	 er 	 	 percent 	 age 	 s 	 	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	0.7	percent	--	dan	dennett	,	who	'll	be	 s 	 peaking 	 	 short 	 ly 	 	.
right	 be 	 low 	 	him	,	0.5	percent	,	steven	pinker	.
so	dennett	's	in	the	lead	a	little	bit	there	.
but	what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	you	can	then	 broad 	 en 	 	the	search	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	 interest 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	and	get	a	sense	of	what	else	is	out	there	.
so	gary	bauer	is	not	too	far	 be 	 hind 	 	--	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	different	 the 	 ories 	 	about	evolution	and	natural	 s 	 election 	 	.
and	right	 be 	 hind 	 	him	is	l.	ron	hubbard	.	so	--	you	can	see	we	're	in	the	ascot	,	which	is	 al 	 ways 	 	good	.
and	by	the	way	,	chris	,	that	would	've	 be 	 en 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	good	 pan 	 el 	 	,	i	think	,	right	there	.
hubbard	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	to	reach	,	but	 be 	 side 	 s 	 	that	,	i	think	it	would	be	good	next	year	.
 an 	 other 	 	quick	thing	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	different	thing	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	analysis	some	of	you	may	have	 s 	 een 	 	.
it	just	came	out	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 burst 	 y 	 	 word 	 s 	 	,	looking	at	the	 historic 	 al 	 	record	of	state	of	the	 un 	 ion 	 	 address 	 es 	 	.
so	these	are	 word 	 s 	 	that	 sudden 	 ly 	 	start	to	appear	out	of	 no 	 where 	 	,	so	they	're	kind	of	,	you	know	,	 meme 	 s 	 	that	start	taking	off	,	that	did	n't	have	a	lot	of	 historic 	 al 	 	 precede 	 nt 	 	before	.
so	the	first	one	is	--	these	are	the	 burst 	 y 	 	 word 	 s 	 	around	1860s	--	 slave 	 s 	 	,	 emancip 	 ation 	 	,	 slave 	 ry 	 	,	 rebel 	 lion 	 	,	kansas	.
that	's	britney	 spear 	 s 	 	.	i	mean	,	you	know	,	ok	,	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
they	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 slave 	 ry 	 	in	1860	.
1935	--	relief	,	 depress 	 ion 	 	,	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	 bank 	 s 	 	.
and	ok	,	i	did	n't	learn	 any 	 thing 	 	new	there	 a 	 s 	 	well	--	that	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	obvious	.
1985	,	right	at	the	center	of	the	reagan	 year 	 s 	 	--	that	's	,	we	're	,	there	's	,	we	've	,	it	's	.
now	,	there	's	one	way	to	interpret	 th 	 is 	 	,	which	is	to	say	that	``	 emancip 	 ation 	 	``	and	``	 depress 	 ion 	 	``	and	``	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	``	all	have	a	lot	of	 syllable 	 s 	 	.
so	you	know	,	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	download	--	it	's	hard	to	remember	 t 	 hose 	 	.
but	 serious 	 ly 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	what	you	can	see	there	,	in	a	way	that	would	be	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	detect	 other 	 wise 	 	,	is	reagan	 re 	 invent 	 ing 	 	the	 politic 	 al 	 	language	of	the	country	and	shifting	to	a	much	more	 intima 	 te 	 	,	much	more	 folk 	 s 	 y 	 	,	much	more	 tele 	 genic 	 	--	 contract 	 ing 	 	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 verb 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	20	 year 	 s 	 	before	it	was	still	,	``	ask	not	what	you	can	do	,	``	but	with	reagan	,	it	's	,	``	that	's	where	,	there	's	nancy	and	i	,	``	that	kind	of	language	.
and	so	 some 	 thing 	 	we	kind	of	 k 	 new 	 	,	but	you	did	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	notice	 syn 	 tactic 	 ally 	 	what	he	was	 do 	 ing 	 	.
i	'll	go	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
the	question	now	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	question	--	is	,	what	kind	of	 high 	 er 	 	-	level	shape	is	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	right	now	in	the	 over 	 all 	 	web	 eco 	 system 	 	--	and	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	in	the	 eco 	 system 	 	of	the	 blog 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	 re 	 ally 	 	kind	of	at	the	cutting	edge	.
and	i	think	what	 happen 	 s 	 	there	will	 al 	 so 	 	happen	in	the	 wide 	 r 	 	system	.
now	there	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	article	by	clay	shirky	that	got	a	lot	of	attention	about	a	month	ago	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	the	 distribut 	 ion 	 	of	 link 	 s 	 	on	the	web	to	all	these	 vari 	 ous 	 	different	 blog 	 s 	 	.
it	 follow 	 s 	 	a	power	law	,	so	that	there	are	a	few	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	well	-	linked	to	,	popular	 blog 	 s 	 	,	and	a	long	tail	of	 blog 	 s 	 	with	 ver 	 y 	 	few	 link 	 s 	 	.
so	20	percent	of	the	 blog 	 s 	 	get	80	percent	of	the	 link 	 s 	 	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	.
it	's	 caus 	 ed 	 	a	lot	of	 contr 	 over 	 s 	 y 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	people	thought	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	ultimate	kind	of	one	man	,	one	 mod 	 em 	 	 demo 	 cracy 	 	,	where	 any 	 body 	 	can	get	out	there	and	get	 the 	 ir 	 	voice	heard	.
and	so	the	question	is	,	``	why	is	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	?	``
it	's	not	 be 	 ing 	 	 impose 	 d 	 	by	 fi 	 at 	 	from	above	.
it	's	an	 emerge 	 nt 	 	 proper 	 ty 	 	of	the	 blog 	 o 	 sphere 	 	right	now	.
now	,	what	's	great	about	it	is	that	people	are	 work 	 ing 	 	on	--	 with 	 in 	 	 second 	 s 	 	of	clay	 publish 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	piece	,	people	 start 	 ed 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	changing	the	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	 rule 	 s 	 	of	the	system	so	that	a	different	shape	would	start	 appear 	 ing 	 	.
and	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	the	shape	 appear 	 s 	 	 large 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	a	kind	of	a	first	-	 m 	 over 	 	advantage	.
if	you	're	the	first	 s 	 ite 	 	there	,	 every 	 body 	 	 link 	 s 	 	to	you	.
if	you	're	the	second	 s 	 ite 	 	there	,	most	people	link	to	you	.
and	so	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	you	can	 accumul 	 ate 	 	a	bunch	of	 link 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 make 	 s 	 	it	more	 like 	 ly 	 	for	 new 	 com 	 ers 	 	to	link	to	you	in	the	future	,	and	then	you	get	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	shape	.
and	so	what	dave	sifry	at	technorati	 start 	 ed 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	 a 	 s 	 	shirky	 start 	 ed 	 	--	after	he	 publish 	 ed 	 	his	piece	--	was	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 bas 	 ically 	 	just	 g 	 ave 	 	a	new	kind	of	 prior 	 ity 	 	to	 new 	 com 	 ers 	 	.
and	he	 start 	 ed 	 	looking	at	 interest 	 ing 	 	 new 	 com 	 ers 	 	that	do	n't	have	a	lot	of	 link 	 s 	 	,	that	 sudden 	 ly 	 	get	a	bunch	of	 link 	 s 	 	in	the	last	24	 hour 	 s 	 	.
so	in	a	sense	,	 burst 	 y 	 	 web 	 log 	 s 	 	coming	from	new	 voice 	 s 	 	.
so	he	's	 work 	 ing 	 	on	a	tool	right	there	that	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	change	the	 over 	 all 	 	system	.
and	it	 create 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	 plan 	 ned 	 	emergence	.
you	're	not	 total 	 ly 	 	in	control	,	but	you	're	changing	the	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	 rule 	 s 	 	in	 interest 	 ing 	 	ways	 be 	 cause 	 	you	have	an	end	result	which	is	 may 	 be 	 	a	more	 democrat 	 ic 	 	spread	of	 voice 	 s 	 	.
so	the	most	 amaz 	 ing 	 	thing	about	 th 	 is 	 	--	and	i	'll	end	on	 th 	 is 	 	note	--	is	,	most	 emerge 	 nt 	 	 system 	 s 	 	,	most	self	-	 organ 	 izing 	 	 system 	 s 	 	are	not	made	up	of	component	 part 	 s 	 	that	are	 cap 	 able 	 	of	looking	at	the	 over 	 all 	 	pattern	and	changing	 the 	 ir 	 	behavior	based	on	 whet 	 her 	 	they	like	the	pattern	or	not	.
so	the	most	 wonder 	 ful 	 	thing	,	i	think	,	about	 th 	 is 	 	whole	debate	about	power	 law 	 s 	 	and	 soft 	 ware 	 	that	could	change	it	is	the	fact	that	we	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	conversation	.
i	hope	it	 continu 	 es 	 	here	.
 thank 	 s 	 	a	lot	.
