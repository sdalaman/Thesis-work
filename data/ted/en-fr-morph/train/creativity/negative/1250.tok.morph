good	afternoon	.
if	you	have	 follow 	 ed 	 	 diplomat 	 ic 	 	news	in	the	past	 week 	 s 	 	,	you	may	have	heard	of	a	kind	of	crisis	between	 chin 	 a 	 	and	the	u.s.	 regard 	 ing 	 	 cyber 	 attack 	 s 	 	against	the	american	company	google	.
 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.	some	people	have	 call 	 ed 	 	a	 cyber 	 war 	 	what	may	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	just	a	 s 	 py 	 	operation	--	and	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	a	 quit 	 e 	 	 mis 	 handle 	 d 	 	one	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	episode	 reveal 	 s 	 	the	growing	 anxie 	 ty 	 	in	the	western	world	 regard 	 ing 	 	these	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	cyber	 weapon 	 s 	 	.
it	so	 happen 	 s 	 	that	these	 weapon 	 s 	 	are	 danger 	 ous 	 	.	they	're	of	a	new	nature	:	they	could	lead	the	world	 in 	 to 	 	a	digital	conflict	that	could	turn	 in 	 to 	 	an	 arm 	 ed 	 	struggle	.
these	virtual	 weapon 	 s 	 	can	 al 	 so 	 	destroy	the	physical	world	.
in	1982	,	in	the	middle	of	the	cold	war	in	soviet	siberia	,	a	 pipe 	 line 	 	 explode 	 d 	 	with	a	burst	of	3	 kilo 	 ton 	 s 	 	,	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	a	fourth	of	the	hiroshima	bomb	.
now	we	know	 to 	 day 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	was	 reveal 	 ed 	 	by	thomas	 re 	 ed 	 	,	ronald	reagan	's	 form 	 er 	 	u.s.	air	force	 secret 	 ary 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	explosion	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	result	of	a	cia	sabotage	operation	,	in	which	they	had	 manage 	 d 	 	to	 infilt 	 rate 	 	the	it	management	 system 	 s 	 	of	that	 pipe 	 line 	 	.
more	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	the	u.s.	government	 reveal 	 ed 	 	that	in	september	2008	,	more	than	3	million	people	in	the	state	of	espirito	santo	in	brazil	 we 	 re 	 	 plunge 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 dark 	 ness 	 	,	 victim 	 s 	 	of	a	 black 	 mail 	 	operation	from	cyber	 pirate 	 s 	 	.
even	more	 worry 	 ing 	 	for	the	americans	,	in	december	2008	the	 holi 	 est 	 	of	 holi 	 es 	 	,	the	it	 system 	 s 	 	of	centcom	,	the	central	command	 man 	 aging 	 	the	 war 	 s 	 	in	 ir 	 aq 	 	and	afghanistan	,	may	have	 be 	 en 	 	 infilt 	 rated 	 	by	 hack 	 ers 	 	who	used	these	:	plain	but	 infect 	 ed 	 	usb	 key 	 s 	 	.	and	with	these	 key 	 s 	 	,	they	may	have	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	get	 in 	 side 	 	centcom	's	 system 	 s 	 	,	to	see	and	hear	 every 	 thing 	 	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	even	infect	some	of	them	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	result	,	the	americans	take	the	threat	 ver 	 y 	 	 serious 	 ly 	 	.	i	'll	quote	general	james	cartwright	,	vice	 chair 	 man 	 	of	the	joint	 chief 	 s 	 	of	staff	,	who	 say 	 s 	 	in	a	report	to	congress	that	 cyber 	 attack 	 s 	 	could	be	 a 	 s 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 weapon 	 s 	 	of	mass	 destruct 	 ion 	 	.
 more 	 over 	 	,	the	americans	have	 decide 	 d 	 	to	 s 	 pend 	 	over	30	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	the	next	five	 year 	 s 	 	to	build	up	 the 	 ir 	 	 cyber 	 war 	 	 cap 	 abilities 	 	.
and	 a 	 cross 	 	the	world	 to 	 day 	 	,	we	see	a	sort	of	cyber	 arm 	 s 	 	race	,	with	 cyber 	 war 	 	 unit 	 s 	 	built	up	by	 count 	 ries 	 	like	north	korea	or	even	iran	.
yet	,	what	you	'll	never	hear	from	 spoke 	 s 	 people 	 	from	the	 pent 	 agon 	 	or	the	french	 depart 	 ment 	 	of	defence	is	that	the	question	is	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	who	's	the	 ene 	 my 	 	,	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	 ver 	 y 	 	nature	of	cyber	 weapon 	 s 	 	.
and	to	understand	why	,	we	must	look	at	how	,	through	the	 age 	 s 	 	,	 militar 	 y 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	have	 maintain 	 ed 	 	or	 destroy 	 ed 	 	world	peace	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	if	we	'd	had	tedxparis	350	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	we	would	have	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	the	 militar 	 y 	 	 innov 	 ation 	 	of	the	day	--	the	massive	vauban	-	style	 fort 	 ification 	 s 	 	--	and	we	could	have	 predict 	 ed 	 	a	period	of	 st 	 ability 	 	in	the	world	or	in	europe	.	which	was	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	the	case	in	europe	between	1650	and	1750	.
 similar 	 ly 	 	,	if	we	'd	had	 th 	 is 	 	talk	30	or	40	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	we	would	have	 s 	 een 	 	how	the	rise	of	nuclear	 weapon 	 s 	 	,	and	the	threat	of	 mutual 	 ly 	 	 assur 	 ed 	 	 destruct 	 ion 	 	they	 imp 	 ly 	 	,	 prevent 	 s 	 	a	direct	fight	between	the	two	 super 	 power 	 s 	 	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	if	we	'd	had	 th 	 is 	 	talk	60	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	we	would	have	 s 	 een 	 	how	the	emergence	of	new	 air 	 craft 	 	and	tank	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	which	give	the	advantage	to	the	 attack 	 er 	 	,	make	the	blitzkrieg	 doctri 	 ne 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	credible	and	thus	create	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	war	in	europe	.
so	 militar 	 y 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	can	influence	the	course	of	the	world	,	can	make	or	break	world	peace	--	and	there	lies	the	issue	with	cyber	 weapon 	 s 	 	.
the	first	issue	:	imagine	a	potential	 ene 	 my 	 	 announc 	 ing 	 	they	're	building	a	 cyber 	 war 	 	unit	,	but	 on 	 ly 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	country	's	defense	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	but	what	 distinguish 	 es 	 	it	from	an	offensive	unit	?
it	 get 	 s 	 	even	more	 complic 	 ated 	 	when	the	 doctri 	 nes 	 	of	use	 be 	 come 	 	 ambigu 	 ous 	 	.
just	3	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	both	the	u.s.	and	france	 we 	 re 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 invest 	 ing 	 	 militar 	 ily 	 	in	 cyber 	 space 	 	,	 strict 	 ly 	 	to	defend	 the 	 ir 	 	it	 system 	 s 	 	.
but	 to 	 day 	 	both	 count 	 ries 	 	say	the	best	defense	is	to	attack	.
and	so	,	they	're	 join 	 ing 	 	 chin 	 a 	 	,	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 doctri 	 ne 	 	of	use	for	15	 year 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	both	defensive	and	offensive	.
the	second	issue	:	your	country	could	be	under	 cyber 	 attack 	 	with	entire	 region 	 s 	 	 plunge 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	total	 dark 	 ness 	 	,	and	you	may	not	even	know	who	's	 attack 	 ing 	 	you	.
cyber	 weapon 	 s 	 	have	 th 	 is 	 	peculiar	feature	:	they	can	be	used	 with 	 out 	 	 leav 	 ing 	 	 trace 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 give 	 s 	 	a	tremendous	advantage	to	the	 attack 	 er 	 	,
 be 	 cause 	 	the	 defend 	 er 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	know	who	to	fight	back	against	.
and	if	the	 defend 	 er 	 	 retali 	 ates 	 	against	the	wrong	 advers 	 ary 	 	,	they	risk	making	one	more	 ene 	 my 	 	and	 end 	 ing 	 	up	 diplomat 	 ically 	 	 isolate 	 d 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	issue	is	n't	just	 theoretic 	 al 	 	.
in	may	2007	,	estonia	was	the	victim	of	 cyber 	 attack 	 s 	 	,	that	 damage 	 d 	 	 it 	 s 	 	communication	and	 bank 	 ing 	 	 system 	 s 	 	.
estonia	 accus 	 ed 	 	russia	.
but	nato	,	 th 	 ough 	 	it	 defend 	 s 	 	estonia	,	 react 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 prud 	 ent 	 ly 	 	.	why	?
 be 	 cause 	 	nato	could	n't	be	100	%	 s 	 ure 	 	that	the	kremlin	was	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	these	 attack 	 s 	 	.
so	to	sum	up	,	on	the	one	hand	,	when	a	possible	 ene 	 my 	 	 announce 	 s 	 	they	're	building	a	 cyber 	 war 	 	unit	,	you	do	n't	know	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	for	attack	or	defense	.	on	the	other	hand	,	we	know	that	these	 weapon 	 s 	 	give	an	advantage	to	 attack 	 ing 	 	.
in	a	major	article	 publish 	 ed 	 	in	1978	,	professor	robert	jervis	of	columbia	university	in	new	york	 de 	 scribed 	 	a	model	to	understand	how	 conflict 	 s 	 	could	arise	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 text 	 	,	when	you	do	n't	know	if	the	potential	 ene 	 my 	 	is	 pre 	 par 	 ing 	 	for	defense	or	attack	,	and	if	the	 weapon 	 s 	 	give	an	advantage	to	 attack 	 ing 	 	,	then	 th 	 is 	 	environment	is	most	 like 	 ly 	 	to	spark	a	conflict	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	environment	that	's	 be 	 ing 	 	 create 	 d 	 	by	cyber	 weapon 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	and	 historic 	 ally 	 	it	was	the	environment	in	europe	at	the	 on 	 set 	 	of	world	war	i	.
so	cyber	 weapon 	 s 	 	are	 danger 	 ous 	 	by	nature	,	but	in	 add 	 ition 	 	,	they	're	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	in	a	much	more	 un 	 s 	 table 	 	environment	.
if	you	remember	the	cold	war	,	it	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	game	,	but	a	 s 	 table 	 	one	 play 	 ed 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	by	two	 player 	 s 	 	,	which	 allow 	 ed 	 	for	some	 coordi 	 nation 	 	between	the	two	 super 	 power 	 s 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	we	're	moving	to	a	 multi 	 polar 	 	world	in	which	 coordi 	 nation 	 	is	much	more	 complic 	 ated 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	have	 s 	 een 	 	at	copenhagen	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	 coordi 	 nation 	 	may	 be 	 come 	 	even	 trick 	 ier 	 	with	the	 introduc 	 tion 	 	of	cyber	 weapon 	 s 	 	.
why	?	 be 	 cause 	 	no	nation	 know 	 s 	 	for	 s 	 ure 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	 it 	 s 	 	neighbor	is	about	to	attack	.
so	 nation 	 s 	 	may	live	under	the	threat	of	what	 no 	 bel 	 	prize	winner	thomas	schelling	 call 	 ed 	 	the	``	 reciproc 	 al 	 	fear	of	surprise	attack	,	``	 a 	 s 	 	i	do	n't	know	if	my	neighbor	is	about	to	attack	me	or	not	--	i	may	never	know	--	so	i	might	take	the	upper	hand	and	attack	first	.
just	last	week	,	in	a	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	article	 d 	 ated 	 	january	26	,	2010	,	it	was	 reveal 	 ed 	 	for	the	first	time	that	 official 	 s 	 	at	the	national	security	 age 	 ncy 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 consider 	 ing 	 	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	 pre 	 emptive 	 	 attack 	 s 	 	in	 case 	 s 	 	where	the	u.s.	was	about	to	be	 cyber 	 attack 	 ed 	 	.
and	these	 pre 	 emptive 	 	 attack 	 s 	 	might	not	just	remain	in	 cyber 	 space 	 	.
in	may	2009	,	general	kevin	chilton	,	 command 	 er 	 	of	the	u.s.	nuclear	 force 	 s 	 	,	 state 	 d 	 	that	in	the	event	of	 cyber 	 attack 	 s 	 	against	the	u.s.	,	all	 option 	 s 	 	would	be	on	the	table	.
cyber	 weapon 	 s 	 	do	not	replace	 convention 	 al 	 	or	nuclear	 weapon 	 s 	 	--
they	just	add	a	new	layer	to	the	 exist 	 ing 	 	system	of	terror	.
but	in	 do 	 ing 	 	so	,	they	 al 	 so 	 	add	 the 	 ir 	 	own	risk	of	 trigger 	 ing 	 	a	conflict	--	 a 	 s 	 	we	've	just	 s 	 een 	 	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	risk	--	and	a	risk	we	may	have	to	confront	with	a	 collect 	 ive 	 	security	solution	which	 include 	 s 	 	all	of	us	:	european	 al 	 lies 	 	,	nato	 member 	 s 	 	,	our	american	 friend 	 s 	 	and	 al 	 lies 	 	,	our	other	western	 al 	 lies 	 	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	,	by	forcing	 the 	 ir 	 	hand	a	little	,	our	russian	and	chinese	 partner 	 s 	 	.
the	information	 techno 	 logies 	 	joÃ«l	de	rosnay	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	,	which	 we 	 re 	 	 historic 	 ally 	 	born	from	 militar 	 y 	 	research	,	are	 to 	 day 	 	on	the	 ver 	 ge 	 	of	 develop 	 ing 	 	an	offensive	 cap 	 ability 	 	of	 destruct 	 ion 	 	,	which	could	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	,	if	we	're	not	 care 	 ful 	 	,	 complete 	 ly 	 	destroy	world	peace	.
