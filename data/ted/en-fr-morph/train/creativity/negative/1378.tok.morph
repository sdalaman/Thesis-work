well	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	honor	for	me	.
i	 s 	 pend 	 	most	of	my	time	in	 jail 	 s 	 	,	in	 pri 	 son 	 s 	 	,	on	death	row	.
i	 s 	 pend 	 	most	of	my	time	in	 ver 	 y 	 	low	-	income	 commun 	 ities 	 	in	the	 project 	 s 	 	and	 place 	 s 	 	where	there	's	a	great	deal	of	 hope 	 lessness 	 	.
and	 be 	 ing 	 	here	at	ted	and	 see 	 ing 	 	the	 stimul 	 ation 	 	,	 hear 	 ing 	 	it	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 energ 	 izing 	 	to	me	.
and	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	's	 emerge 	 d 	 	in	my	short	time	here	is	that	ted	 ha 	 s 	 	an	 ident 	 ity 	 	.
and	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	say	 thing 	 s 	 	here	that	have	 impact 	 s 	 	around	the	world	.
and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	through	ted	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	meaning	and	power	that	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	when	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	.
and	i	 ment 	 ion 	 	that	 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	 ident 	 ity 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
and	we	've	had	some	fantastic	 present 	 ations 	 	.
and	i	think	what	we	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	is	that	,	if	you	're	a	teacher	your	 word 	 s 	 	can	be	 meaning 	 ful 	 	,	but	if	you	're	a	 com 	 passionate 	 	teacher	,	they	can	be	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 meaning 	 ful 	 	.
if	you	're	a	doctor	you	can	do	some	good	 thing 	 s 	 	,	but	if	you	're	a	 car 	 ing 	 	doctor	you	can	do	some	other	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	so	i	want	to	talk	about	the	power	of	 ident 	 ity 	 	.
and	i	did	n't	learn	about	 th 	 is 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 p 	 rac 	 tic 	 ing 	 	law	and	 do 	 ing 	 	the	work	that	i	do	.
i	 actual 	 ly 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	from	my	 grand 	 mother 	 	.
i	grew	up	in	a	house	that	was	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	african	american	home	that	was	 dominate 	 d 	 	by	a	 ma 	 tri 	 arch 	 	,	and	that	 ma 	 tri 	 arch 	 	was	my	 grand 	 mother 	 	.
she	was	tough	,	she	was	strong	,	she	was	 power 	 ful 	 	.
she	was	the	end	of	every	argument	in	our	family	.
she	was	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	a	lot	of	 argument 	 s 	 	in	our	family	.
she	was	the	daughter	of	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 enslave 	 d 	 	.
her	 parent 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	born	in	 slave 	 ry 	 	in	virginia	in	the	1840	's	.
she	was	born	in	the	1880	's	and	the	experience	of	 slave 	 ry 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	shaped	the	way	she	saw	the	world	.
and	my	 grand 	 mother 	 	was	tough	,	but	she	was	 al 	 so 	 	loving	.
when	i	would	see	her	 a 	 s 	 	a	little	boy	,	she	'd	come	up	to	me	and	she	'd	give	me	these	 hug 	 s 	 	.
and	she	'd	 squeez 	 e 	 	me	so	tight	i	could	 bare 	 ly 	 	breathe	and	then	she	'd	let	me	go	.
and	an	hour	or	two	 lat 	 er 	 	,	if	i	saw	her	,	she	'd	come	over	to	me	and	she	'd	say	,	``	bryan	,	do	you	still	feel	me	 hugg 	 ing 	 	you	?	``	and	if	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	``	she	'd	assault	me	 aga 	 in 	 	,	and	if	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	``	she	'd	 leav 	 e 	 	me	 al 	 one 	 	.
and	she	just	had	 th 	 is 	 	quality	that	you	 al 	 ways 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	near	her	.
and	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 challeng 	 e 	 	was	that	she	had	10	children	.
my	mom	was	the	 young 	 est 	 	of	her	10	 kid 	 s 	 	.
and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	when	i	would	go	and	 s 	 pend 	 	time	with	her	,	it	would	be	difficult	to	get	her	time	and	attention	.
my	 cousin 	 s 	 	would	be	running	around	 every 	 where 	 	.
and	i	remember	,	when	i	was	about	eight	or	nine	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	 wa 	 king 	 	up	one	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	going	 in 	 to 	 	the	living	room	,	and	all	of	my	 cousin 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	running	around	.
and	my	 grand 	 mother 	 	was	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	room	 star 	 ing 	 	at	me	.
and	at	first	i	thought	we	 we 	 re 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	a	game	.
and	i	would	look	at	her	and	i	'd	 s 	 mile 	 	,	but	she	was	 ver 	 y 	 	serious	.
and	after	about	15	or	20	 minute 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	she	got	up	and	she	came	 a 	 cross 	 	the	room	and	she	took	me	by	the	hand	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	come	on	,	bryan	.	you	and	i	are	going	to	have	a	talk	.	``	and	i	remember	 th 	 is 	 	just	like	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	 yester 	 day 	 	.
i	never	will	forget	it	.
she	took	me	out	back	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	bryan	,	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	 some 	 thing 	 	,	but	you	do	n't	tell	 any 	 body 	 	what	i	tell	you	.	``	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	mama	.	``	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	now	you	make	 s 	 ure 	 	you	do	n't	do	that	.	``	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 s 	 ure 	 	.	``

when	i	was	about	14	or	15	,	one	day	my	brother	came	home	and	he	had	 th 	 is 	 	six	-	pack	of	beer	--	i	do	n't	know	where	he	got	it	--	and	he	 grab 	 bed 	 	me	and	my	sister	and	we	went	out	in	the	 wood 	 s 	 	.

when	i	thought	about	my	 grand 	 mother 	 	,	of	course	she	would	think	all	her	 grand 	 kid 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	special	.
my	 grand 	 father 	 	was	in	 pri 	 son 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	 prohibit 	 ion 	 	.

and	these	 we 	 re 	 	the	 thing 	 s 	 	she	thought	we	 need 	 ed 	 	to	commit	to	.
well	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	say	 some 	 thing 	 	about	our	criminal	justice	system	.
 th 	 is 	 	country	is	 ver 	 y 	 	different	 to 	 day 	 	than	it	was	40	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
in	1972	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	300,000	people	in	 jail 	 s 	 	and	 pri 	 son 	 s 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	there	are	2.3	million	.
the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	now	 ha 	 s 	 	the	highest	rate	of	 incarce 	 ration 	 	in	the	world	.
we	have	seven	million	people	on	 prob 	 ation 	 	and	 paro 	 le 	 	.
and	mass	 incarce 	 ration 	 	,	in	my	judgment	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	 change 	 d 	 	our	world	.
in	poor	 commun 	 ities 	 	,	in	 commun 	 ities 	 	of	color	there	is	 th 	 is 	 	despair	,	there	is	 th 	 is 	 	 hope 	 lessness 	 	,	that	is	 be 	 ing 	 	shaped	by	these	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	.
one	out	of	three	black	men	between	the	 age 	 s 	 	of	18	and	30	is	in	jail	,	in	 pri 	 son 	 	,	on	 prob 	 ation 	 	or	 paro 	 le 	 	.
in	urban	 commun 	 ities 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	 th 	 is 	 	country	--	los	angeles	,	philadelphia	,	baltimore	,	washington	--	50	to	60	percent	of	all	young	men	of	color	are	in	jail	or	 pri 	 son 	 	or	on	 prob 	 ation 	 	or	 paro 	 le 	 	.
our	system	is	n't	just	 be 	 ing 	 	shaped	in	these	ways	that	seem	to	be	 distort 	 ing 	 	around	race	,	they	're	 al 	 so 	 	 distort 	 ed 	 	by	poverty	.
we	have	a	system	of	justice	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	that	 treat 	 s 	 	you	much	better	if	you	're	rich	and	 guilt 	 y 	 	than	if	you	're	poor	and	 innoc 	 ent 	 	.
wealth	,	not	_UNK_	,	 shape 	 s 	 	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	.
and	yet	,	we	seem	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 comfort 	 able 	 	.
the	 politic 	 s 	 	of	fear	and	anger	have	made	us	 believ 	 e 	 	that	these	are	 problem 	 s 	 	that	are	not	our	 problem 	 s 	 	.
we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 dis 	 connect 	 ed 	 	.
it	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	me	.
we	're	looking	at	some	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 develop 	 ments 	 	in	our	work	.
my	state	of	alabama	,	like	a	number	of	 state 	 s 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	 permanent 	 ly 	 	_UNK_	you	if	you	have	a	criminal	 convict 	 ion 	 	.
right	now	in	alabama	34	percent	of	the	black	male	population	 ha 	 s 	 	 permanent 	 ly 	 	lost	the	right	to	vote	.
we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 project 	 ing 	 	in	 an 	 other 	 	10	 year 	 s 	 	the	level	of	_UNK_	will	be	 a 	 s 	 	high	 a 	 s 	 	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	since	prior	to	the	 pass 	 age 	 	of	the	 vot 	 ing 	 	 right 	 s 	 	act	.
and	there	is	 th 	 is 	 	 stunn 	 ing 	 	silence	.
i	represent	children	.
a	lot	of	my	 client 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	young	.
the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	country	in	the	world	where	we	sentence	13	-	year	-	old	children	to	die	in	 pri 	 son 	 	.
we	have	life	 imprison 	 ment 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 paro 	 le 	 	for	 kid 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	.
and	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	some	 litig 	 ation 	 	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	country	in	the	world	.
i	represent	people	on	death	row	.
it	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	question	of	the	death	 penal 	 ty 	 	.
in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	,	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	taught	to	think	that	the	real	question	is	,	do	people	deserve	to	die	for	the	 crime 	 s 	 	they	've	 commit 	 ted 	 	?
and	that	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 sens 	 ible 	 	question	.
but	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	way	of	 think 	 ing 	 	about	where	we	are	in	our	 ident 	 ity 	 	.
the	other	way	of	 think 	 ing 	 	about	it	is	not	,	do	people	deserve	to	die	for	the	 crime 	 s 	 	they	commit	,
but	do	we	deserve	to	kill	?
i	mean	,	it	's	 fasci 	 nating 	 	.
death	 penal 	 ty 	 	in	america	is	defined	by	error	.
for	every	nine	people	who	have	 be 	 en 	 	 execute 	 d 	 	,	we	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	identified	one	 innoc 	 ent 	 	person	who	's	 be 	 en 	 	 ex 	 one 	 rated 	 	and	released	from	death	row	.
a	kind	of	 astonish 	 ing 	 	error	rate	--	one	out	of	nine	people	 innoc 	 ent 	 	.
i	mean	,	it	's	 fasci 	 nating 	 	.
in	 av 	 iation 	 	,	we	would	never	let	people	fly	on	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	if	for	every	nine	 plane 	 s 	 	that	took	off	one	would	crash	.
but	 some 	 how 	 	we	can	insulate	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	problem	.
it	's	not	our	problem	.
it	's	not	our	burden	.
it	's	not	our	struggle	.
i	talk	a	lot	about	these	 issue 	 s 	 	.
i	talk	about	race	and	 th 	 is 	 	question	of	 whet 	 her 	 	we	deserve	to	kill	.
and	it	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	when	i	teach	my	 student 	 s 	 	about	african	american	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	i	tell	them	about	 slave 	 ry 	 	.
i	tell	them	about	 terror 	 ism 	 	,	the	era	that	 beg 	 an 	 	at	the	end	of	 re 	 construction 	 	that	went	on	to	world	war	ii	.
we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	know	 ver 	 y 	 	much	about	it	.
but	for	african	americans	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	,	that	was	an	era	defined	by	terror	.
in	 man 	 y 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	,	people	had	to	worry	about	 be 	 ing 	 	lynched	.
they	had	to	worry	about	 be 	 ing 	 	 bomb 	 ed 	 	.
it	was	the	threat	of	terror	that	shaped	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
and	these	 old 	 er 	 	people	come	up	to	me	now	and	they	say	,	``	mr.	stevenson	,	you	give	 talk 	 s 	 	,	you	make	 speech 	 es 	 	,	you	tell	people	to	stop	 say 	 ing 	 	we	're	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	 terror 	 ism 	 	for	the	first	time	in	our	nation	's	 histo 	 ry 	 	after	9/11	.	``
they	tell	me	to	say	,	``	no	,	tell	them	that	we	grew	up	with	that	.	``
and	that	era	of	 terror 	 ism 	 	,	of	course	,	was	 follow 	 ed 	 	by	 s 	 egreg 	 ation 	 	and	 decade 	 s 	 	of	racial	 sub 	 ordin 	 ation 	 	and	apartheid	.
and	yet	,	we	have	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	 th 	 is 	 	dynamic	where	we	 re 	 ally 	 	do	n't	like	to	talk	about	our	 problem 	 s 	 	.
we	do	n't	like	to	talk	about	our	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	of	that	,	we	 re 	 ally 	 	have	n't	 under 	 stood 	 	what	it	's	 me 	 ant 	 	to	do	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	 historic 	 ally 	 	.
we	're	 constant 	 ly 	 	running	 in 	 to 	 	each	other	.
we	're	 constant 	 ly 	 	creating	 tension 	 s 	 	and	 conflict 	 s 	 	.
we	have	a	hard	time	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	race	,	and	i	 believ 	 e 	 	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	we	are	 un 	 will 	 ing 	 	to	commit	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	a	process	of	truth	and	 reconcili 	 ation 	 	.
in	south	africa	,	people	 under 	 stood 	 	that	we	could	n't	 over 	 come 	 	apartheid	 with 	 out 	 	a	 commit 	 ment 	 	to	truth	and	 reconcili 	 ation 	 	.
in	rwanda	,	even	after	the	genocide	,	there	was	 th 	 is 	 	 commit 	 ment 	 	,	but	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	we	have	n't	 d 	 one 	 	that	.
i	was	giving	some	 lectur 	 es 	 	in	germany	about	the	death	 penal 	 ty 	 	.
it	was	 fasci 	 nating 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	one	of	the	 scholar 	 s 	 	stood	up	after	the	 present 	 ation 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	you	know	it	's	 deep 	 ly 	 	 trou 	 bling 	 	to	hear	what	you	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	.	``

if	you	live	in	the	state	of	california	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	there	's	a	 refer 	 end 	 um 	 	coming	up	 th 	 is 	 	spring	where	 actual 	 ly 	 	there	's	going	to	be	an	effort	to	 re 	 direct 	 	some	of	the	money	we	 s 	 pend 	 	on	the	 politic 	 s 	 	of	 punish 	 ment 	 	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	here	in	california	we	're	going	to	 s 	 pend 	 	one	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	on	the	death	 penal 	 ty 	 	in	the	next	five	 year 	 s 	 	--	one	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
and	yet	,	46	percent	of	all	 hom 	 icide 	 	 case 	 s 	 	do	n't	result	in	arrest	.
56	percent	of	all	rape	 case 	 s 	 	do	n't	result	.
so	there	's	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	change	that	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 refer 	 end 	 um 	 	would	 pro 	 pose 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 dollar 	 s 	 	go	to	law	 enforce 	 ment 	 	and	 safe 	 ty 	 	.
and	i	think	that	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	 exist 	 s 	 	all	around	us	.
ca	:	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	 th 	 is 	 	huge	decline	in	crime	in	america	over	the	last	three	 decade 	 s 	 	.
and	part	of	the	narrative	of	that	is	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	that	it	's	about	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	 incarce 	 ration 	 	rates	.
what	would	you	say	to	 some 	 one 	 	who	 believ 	 ed 	 	that	?
bs	:	well	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	violent	crime	rate	 ha 	 s 	 	 remain 	 ed 	 	 relat 	 ively 	 	 s 	 table 	 	.
the	great	 in 	 crease 	 	in	mass	 incarce 	 ration 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	was	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	in	violent	crime	 categor 	 ies 	 	.
it	was	 th 	 is 	 	 mis 	 guide 	 d 	 	war	on	 drug 	 s 	 	.
that	's	where	the	 dramat 	 ic 	 	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	have	come	in	our	 pri 	 son 	 	population	.
and	we	got	carried	away	with	the	rhetoric	of	 punish 	 ment 	 	.
and	so	we	have	three	 strike 	 s 	 	 law 	 s 	 	that	put	people	in	 pri 	 son 	 	 fore 	 ver 	 	for	 steal 	 ing 	 	a	 bi 	 cycle 	 	,	for	low	-	level	 proper 	 ty 	 	 crime 	 s 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	making	them	give	 t 	 hose 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	back	to	the	people	who	they	victimized	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	we	need	to	do	more	to	help	people	who	are	victimized	by	crime	,	not	do	less	.
and	i	think	our	current	 punish 	 ment 	 	 philosoph 	 y 	 	 do 	 es 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	for	no	one	.
and	i	think	that	's	the	 orient 	 ation 	 	that	we	have	to	change	.
ca	:	bryan	,	you	've	 s 	 truck 	 	a	massive	 chor 	 d 	 	here	.
you	're	an	inspiring	person	.
thank	you	so	much	for	coming	to	ted	.	thank	you	.
