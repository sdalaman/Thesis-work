so	i	'm	here	to	tell	you	a	story	of	success	from	africa	.
a	year	and	a	half	ago	,	four	of	the	five	people	who	are	full	time	 member 	 s 	 	at	ushahidi	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	``	 test 	 im 	 ony 	 	``	in	swahili	,	 we 	 re 	 	ted	 fellow 	 s 	 	.
a	year	ago	in	kenya	we	had	post	-	election	violence	.
and	in	that	time	we	 prototype 	 d 	 	and	built	,	in	about	three	 day 	 s 	 	,	a	system	that	would	allow	 any 	 body 	 	with	a	mobile	phone	to	 s 	 end 	 	in	information	and	 report 	 s 	 	on	what	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	around	them	.
we	took	what	we	 k 	 new 	 	about	africa	,	the	default	 de 	 vice 	 	,	the	mobile	phone	,	 a 	 s 	 	our	common	 denomi 	 nator 	 	,	and	went	from	there	.
we	got	 report 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	just	a	couple	of	them	from	january	17th	,	last	year	.
and	our	system	was	 rud 	 imentary 	 	.	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 bas 	 ic 	 	.
it	was	a	mash	-	up	that	used	data	that	we	 collect 	 ed 	 	from	people	,	and	we	put	it	on	our	map	.
but	then	we	 decide 	 d 	 	we	 need 	 ed 	 	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	more	.
we	 need 	 ed 	 	to	take	what	we	had	built	and	create	a	platform	out	of	it	so	that	it	could	be	used	 else 	 where 	 	in	the	world	.
and	so	there	is	a	team	of	 develop 	 ers 	 	from	all	over	africa	,	who	are	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	team	now	--	from	ghana	,	from	malawi	,	from	kenya	.
there	is	even	some	from	the	u.s.	we	're	building	for	 smart 	 phone 	 s 	 	,	so	that	it	can	be	used	in	the	 develop 	 ed 	 	world	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	.
we	are	 real 	 izing 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	true	.
if	it	 work 	 s 	 	in	africa	then	it	will	work	 any 	 where 	 	.
and	so	we	build	for	it	in	africa	first	and	then	we	move	to	the	 edge 	 s 	 	.
it	's	now	 be 	 en 	 	 deploy 	 ed 	 	in	the	 democrat 	 ic 	 	 re 	 public 	 	of	the	congo	.
it	's	 be 	 ing 	 	used	by	ngos	all	over	east	africa	,
small	ngos	 do 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	little	 project 	 s 	 	.
just	 th 	 is 	 	last	month	it	was	 deploy 	 ed 	 	by	al	jazeera	in	gaza	.
but	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	not	what	i	'm	here	to	talk	about	.
i	'm	here	to	talk	about	the	next	big	thing	,	 be 	 cause 	 	what	we	're	 find 	 ing 	 	out	is	that	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	report	 eye 	 witness 	 	 account 	 s 	 	of	what	's	going	on	in	real	time	.
we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	 event 	 s 	 	like	mumbai	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,
where	it	's	so	much	 eas 	 ier 	 	to	report	now	than	it	is	to	 consum 	 e 	 	it	.
there	is	so	much	information	;	what	do	you	do	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	twitter	 report 	 s 	 	for	over	three	 day 	 s 	 	just	 cover 	 ing 	 	mumbai	.
how	do	you	decide	what	is	 import 	 ant 	 	?
what	is	the	 ver 	 a 	 city 	 	level	of	what	you	're	looking	at	?
so	what	we	find	is	that	there	is	 th 	 is 	 	great	deal	of	 waste 	 d 	 	crisis	information	 be 	 cause 	 	there	is	just	too	much	information	for	us	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	 any 	 thing 	 	with	right	now	.
and	what	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 concern 	 ed 	 	with	is	 th 	 is 	 	first	three	 hour 	 s 	 	.
what	we	are	looking	at	is	the	first	three	 hour 	 s 	 	.
how	do	we	deal	with	that	information	that	is	coming	in	?
you	ca	n't	understand	what	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
on	the	ground	and	around	the	world	people	are	still	 cur 	 ious 	 	,	and	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	what	is	going	on	.	but	they	do	n't	know	.
so	what	we	built	of	course	,	ushahidi	,	is	 crowd 	 sourcing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	information	.
you	see	 th 	 is 	 	with	twitter	,	too	.	you	get	 th 	 is 	 	information	 over 	 load 	 	.
so	you	've	got	a	lot	of	information	.	that	's	great	.
but	now	what	?
so	we	think	that	there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	we	can	do	here	.
and	we	have	a	small	team	who	is	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
we	think	that	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	create	a	 crowd 	 sourced 	 	filter	.
take	the	crowd	and	 app 	 ly 	 	them	to	the	information	.
and	by	rating	it	and	by	rating	the	different	people	who	submit	information	,	we	can	get	 refine 	 d 	 	 result 	 s 	 	and	 weight 	 ed 	 	 result 	 s 	 	.
so	that	we	have	a	better	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	the	 prob 	 ability 	 	of	 some 	 thing 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	true	or	not	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	kind	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	that	is	,	 quit 	 e 	 	 frank 	 ly 	 	--	it	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	that	it	's	coming	from	africa	.
it	's	coming	from	 place 	 s 	 	that	you	would	n't	expect	.
from	young	,	smart	 develop 	 ers 	 	.
and	it	's	a	community	around	it	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	to	build	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	,	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
and	we	are	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	to	be	part	of	the	ted	family	.
