together	with	the	 architect 	 s 	 	of	albert	speer	&	partner	,	our	 engineer 	 s 	 	from	transsolar	have	 be 	 en 	 	 support 	 ing 	 	,	have	 be 	 en 	 	 develop 	 ing 	 	open	-	air	stadia	based	on	100	percent	solar	power	,	on	100	percent	solar	 cool 	 ing 	 	.
let	me	tell	you	about	that	,	but	let	me	start	with	comfort	.
let	me	start	with	the	 a 	 spect 	 	of	comfort	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	are	 con 	 fusing 	 	 ambi 	 ent 	 	temperature	with	thermal	comfort	.
we	are	used	to	looking	at	 chart 	 s 	 	like	that	,	and	you	see	 th 	 is 	 	red	line	 show 	 ing 	 	the	air	temperature	in	june	and	july	,	and	 y 	 es 	 	,	that	's	right	,	it	's	 pick 	 ing 	 	up	to	45	 degree 	 s 	 	c	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	hot	.
but	air	temperature	is	not	the	full	set	of	 cl 	 im 	 atic 	 	 parameter 	 s 	 	which	define	comfort	.
let	me	show	you	analysis	a	 col 	 league 	 	of	mine	did	looking	on	different	 foot 	 ball 	 	,	world	 cup 	 s 	 	,	olympic	 game 	 s 	 	around	the	world	,	looking	on	the	comfort	and	 analyz 	 ing 	 	the	comfort	people	have	 perceive 	 d 	 	at	these	different	 s 	 port 	 	 activ 	 ities 	 	,	and	let	me	start	with	mexico	.

it	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 comfort 	 able 	 	game	in	mexico	city	.	have	a	look	.
orlando	,	same	kind	of	 stad 	 ium 	 	,	open	-	air	 stad 	 ium 	 	.	people	have	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	the	strong	 s 	 un 	 	,	in	the	 ver 	 y 	 	high	 hu 	 mid 	 ity 	 	in	the	afternoon	,	and	they
did	not	enjoy	.	it	was	not	 comfort 	 able 	 	.
the	air	temperature	was	not	too	high	,	but	it	was	not	 comfort 	 able 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	these	 game 	 s 	 	.
what	about	seoul	?	seoul	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 broad 	 cast 	 	 right 	 s 	 	,	all	the	 game 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	in	the	late

what	about	athens	?	mediterranean	climate	,	but	in	the	 s 	 un 	 	it	was	not	 comfort 	 able 	 	.	they	did	n't	perceive	comfort	.
and	we	know	that	from	spain	,	we	know	that	``	sol	y	sombra	.	``
if	you	have	a	ticket	,	and	you	get	a	ticket	for	the	 sha 	 de 	 	,	you	pay	more	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	in	a	more	 comfort 	 able 	 	environment	.
what	about	beijing	?
it	's	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 s 	 un 	 	in	the	day	and	high	 hu 	 mid 	 ity 	 	,	and	it	was	not	 comfort 	 able 	 	.
so	if	i	 over 	 lay 	 	,	and	if	you	 over 	 lay 	 	all	these	comfort	envelopes	,	what	we	see	is	,	in	all	these	 place 	 s 	 	,	air	temperature	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	ranging	 some 	 thing 	 	from	25	to	35	,	and	if	you	go	on	the	line	,	30	,	of	30	 degree 	 s 	 	c	 ambi 	 ent 	 	 temperature 	 s 	 	.	if	you	go	 a 	 long 	 	that	line	you	see	there	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	all	kind	of	comfort	,	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 perceive 	 d 	 	 out 	 door 	 	comfort	,	ranging	from	 ver 	 y 	 	 comfort 	 able 	 	to	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	.
so	why	is	that	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	there	are	more	 parameter 	 s 	 	 in 	 flu 	 encing 	 	our	thermal	comfort	,	which	is	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	the	direct	 s 	 un 	 	,	the	diffuse	 s 	 un 	 	,	which	is	wind	,	strong	wind	,	mild	wind	,	which	is	air	 hu 	 mid 	 ity 	 	,	which	is	the	 radi 	 ant 	 	temperature	of	the	 surround 	 ing 	 s 	 	where	we	are	in	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	air	temperature	.
all	these	 parameter 	 s 	 	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	comfort	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	our	human	body	,	and	 scientist 	 s 	 	have	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	parameter	,	which	is	the	 perceive 	 d 	 	temperature	,	where	all	these	 parameter 	 s 	 	go	in	and	help	 design 	 ers 	 	to	understand	which	is	the	 driv 	 ing 	 	parameter	that	i	feel	comfort	or	that	i	do	n't	feel	comfort	.
which	is	the	 driv 	 ing 	 	parameter	which	 give 	 s 	 	me	a	 perceive 	 d 	 	temperature	?	and	these	 parameter 	 s 	 	,	these	 cl 	 im 	 atic 	 	 parameter 	 s 	 	are	related	to	the	human	 metabol 	 ism 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	of	our	 metabol 	 ism 	 	,	we	 a 	 s 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	we	produce	heat	.
i	'm	 excit 	 ed 	 	,	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	you	,	i	'm	 prob 	 ably 	 	producing	150	 watt 	 s 	 	at	the	moment	.	you	are	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	,	you	are	 relax 	 ed 	 	,	you	're	looking	at	me	.	it	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	100	 watt 	 s 	 	each	person	is	producing	,	and	we	need	to	get	rid	of	that	energy	.	i	need	,	with	my	body	,	to	get	rid	of	the	energy	,	and	the	 hard 	 er 	 	it	is	for	 my 	 self 	 	,	for	my	body	,	to	get	rid	of	the	energy	,	the	less	comfort	i	feel	.
that	's	it	.	and	if	i	do	n't	get	rid	of	the	energy	,	i	will	die	.
if	we	 over 	 lay 	 	what	 happen 	 s 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	 foot 	 ball 	 	world	cup	,	what	will	happen	in	june	,	july	,	we	will	see	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	air	temperature	will	be	much	 high 	 er 	 	,	but	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 game 	 s 	 	and	the	 play 	 s 	 	will	be	in	the	afternoon	,	it	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	same	comfort	rating	we	've	found	in	other	 place 	 s 	 	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 perceive 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	non	-	 comfort 	 able 	 	.
so	we	 s 	 at 	 	together	with	a	team	which	prepared	the	bid	book	,	or	goal	,	that	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	let	's	aim	for	 perceive 	 d 	 	temperature	,	for	 out 	 door 	 	comfort	in	 th 	 is 	 	range	,	which	is	 perceive 	 d 	 	with	a	temperature	of	32	 degree 	 s 	 	celsius	 perceive 	 d 	 	temperature	,	which	is	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 comfort 	 able 	 	.
people	would	feel	 re 	 ally 	 	fine	in	an	open	 out 	 door 	 	environment	.
but	what	 do 	 es 	 	it	mean	?
if	we	just	look	on	what	 happen 	 s 	 	,	we	see	,	temperature	's	too	high	.
if	we	 app 	 ly 	 	the	best	 architect 	 ural 	 	design	,	climate	 engineer 	 ing 	 	design	,	we	wo	n't	get	much	better	.
so	we	need	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	active	.
we	need	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	to	 br 	 ing 	 	in	 radi 	 ant 	 	 cool 	 ing 	 	technology	,	and	we	need	to	combine	 th 	 is 	 	with	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	soft	 condition 	 ing 	 	.
and	how	 do 	 es 	 	it	look	like	in	a	 stad 	 ium 	 	?
so	the	 stad 	 ium 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	few	 element 	 s 	 	which	create	that
 out 	 door 	 	comfort	.	first	of	all	,	it	's	 s 	 had 	 ing 	 	.	it	 need 	 s 	 	to	protect	where	the	people	are	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	against	strong	and	warm	wind	.
but	that	's	not	all	what	we	need
to	do	.	we	need	to	use	active	 system 	 s 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	 blow 	 ing 	 	a	hurricane	of	 chill 	 ed 	 	air	through	the	 stad 	 ium 	 	,	we	can	use	 radi 	 ant 	 	 cool 	 ing 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	like	a	floor	 heat 	 ing 	 	system	where	water	 pipe 	 s 	 	are	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	in	the	floor	.
and	just	by	using	cold	water	going	through	the	water	 pipe 	 s 	 	,	you	can	 re 	 lease 	 	the	heat	which	is	 absorb 	 ed 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	day	in	the	 stad 	 ium 	 	,	so	you	can	create	that	comfort	,	and	then	by	 add 	 ing 	 	dry	air	 in 	 stead 	 	of	down	-	 chill 	 ed 	 	air	,	the	 spect 	 ators 	 	and	the	 foot 	 ball 	 	 player 	 s 	 	can	adjust	to	 the 	 ir 	 	individual	comfort	 need 	 s 	 	,	to	 the 	 ir 	 	individual	energy	balance	.
they	can	adjust	and	find	 the 	 ir 	 	comfort	they	need	to	find	.
there	are	12	stadia	 prob 	 ably 	 	to	come	,	but	there	are	32	training	 pitch 	 es 	 	where	all	the	individual	 count 	 ries 	 	are	going	to	train	.
we	 appli 	 ed 	 	the	same	 con 	 cept 	 	:	 s 	 had 	 ing 	 	of	the	training	pitch	,	using	a	shelter	against	wind	,	then	using	the	grass	.
natural	-	 water 	 ed 	 	lawn	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 cool 	 ing 	 	source	stabilizing	temperature	,	and	using	dehumidified	air	to	create	comfort	.
but	even	the	best	 pass 	 ive 	 	design	would	n't	help	.
we	need	active	system	.
and	how	do	we	do	that	?
our	idea	for	the	bid	was	100	percent	solar	 cool 	 ing 	 	,	based	on	the	idea	that	we	use	the	roof	of	the	stadia	,	we	cover	the	 roof 	 s 	 	of	the	stadia	with	pv	 system 	 s 	 	.
we	do	n't	borrow	any	energy	from	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
we	are	not	using	fossil	 energ 	 ies 	 	.
we	are	not	 borrow 	 ing 	 	energy	from	our	 neighbor 	 s 	 	.
we	're	using	energy	we	can	harvest	on	our	 roof 	 s 	 	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	on	the	training	 pitch 	 es 	 	,	which	will	be	 cover 	 ed 	 	with	large	,	 flex 	 ible 	 	 membrane 	 s 	 	,	and	we	will	see	in	the	next	 year 	 s 	 	an	industry	coming	up	with	 flex 	 ible 	 	 photovoltaic 	 s 	 	,	giving	the	 possibil 	 ities 	 	of	 s 	 had 	 ing 	 	against	strong	 s 	 un 	 	and	producing	electric	energy	in	the	same	time	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	energy	now	is	 harvest 	 ed 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	year	,	 s 	 ent 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	grid	,	is	 re 	 placing 	 	 fossil 	 s 	 	in	the	grid	,	and	when	i	need	it	for	the	 cool 	 ing 	 	,	i	take	it	back	from	the	grid	and	i	use	the	solar	energy	which	i	have	 br 	 ought 	 	to	the	grid	back	when	i	need	it	for	the	solar	 cool 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	can	do	that	in	the	first	year	and	i	can	balance	that	in	the	next	10	,	and	the	next	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	energy	,	which	is	 necess 	 ary 	 	to	condition	a	world	cup	in	qatar	,	the	next	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	energy	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	grid	of	qatar	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	--	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	for	stadia	.	we	can	use	that	 al 	 so 	 	in	open	-	air	 place 	 s 	 	and	 street 	 s 	 	,	and	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	the	city	of	the	future	in	masdar	,	which	is	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	emirates	,	abu	dhabi	.
and	i	had	the	pleasure	to	work	on	the	central	plaza	.
and	the	same	idea	to	use	there	,	to	create	 out 	 door 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	which	are	 perceive 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 comfort 	 able 	 	.	people	enjoy	going	there	 in 	 stead 	 	of	going	 in 	 to 	 	a	 shop 	 ping 	 	mall	,	which	is	 chill 	 ed 	 	down	and	which	is	 cool 	 ed 	 	.	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	create	an	 out 	 door 	 	space	which	is	so	 comfort 	 able 	 	that	people	can	go	there	in	the	early	afternoon	,	even	in	these	 s 	 un 	 ny 	 	and	hot	summer	 month 	 s 	 	,	and	they	can	enjoy	and	meet	there	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	.
and	the	same	 con 	 cept 	 	:	 sha 	 de 	 	against	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	 sha 	 de 	 	against	the	wind	,	and	use	,	use	and	take	advantage	of	the	 s 	 un 	 	you	can	harvest	on	your	 foot 	 print 	 	.
and	these	 beaut 	 iful 	 	umbrellas	.
so	i	'd	like	to	 encourag 	 e 	 	you	to	pay	attention	to	your	thermal	comfort	,	to	your	thermal	environment	,	 to 	 night 	 	and	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	,	and	if	you	'd	like	to	learn	more	about	that	,	i	 invit 	 e 	 	you	to	go	to	our	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
we	 upload 	 ed 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 perceive 	 d 	 	temperature	 calcul 	 ator 	 	where	you	can	check	out	about	your	 out 	 door 	 	comfort	.
and	i	 al 	 so 	 	hope	that	you	share	the	idea	that	if	 engineer 	 s 	 	and	 design 	 ers 	 	can	use	all	these	different	 cl 	 im 	 atic 	 	 parameter 	 s 	 	,	it	will	be	possible	to	create	 re 	 ally 	 	good	and	 comfort 	 able 	 	 out 	 door 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	,	to	change	our	thermal	 per 	 ception 	 	that	we	feel	 comfort 	 able 	 	in	an	 out 	 door 	 	environment	,	and	we	can	do	that	with	the	best	 pass 	 ive 	 	design	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	using	the	energy	source	of	the	 s 	 ite 	 	in	qatar	which	is	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
