i	am	a	conductor	,	and	i	'm	here	 to 	 day 	 	to	talk	to	you	about	trust	.
my	job	 depend 	 s 	 	 up 	 on 	 	it	.
there	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	,	between	me	and	the	orchestra	,	an	 unshak 	 able 	 	bond	of	trust	,	born	out	of	mutual	respect	,	through	which	we	can	spin	a	musical	narrative	that	we	all	 believ 	 e 	 	in	.
now	in	the	old	 day 	 s 	 	,	 conduct 	 ing 	 	,	music	making	,	was	less	about	trust	and	more	,	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	about	 coerc 	 ion 	 	.
up	to	and	around	about	the	second	world	war	,	 conductor 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 in 	 vari 	 ably 	 	 dictator 	 s 	 	--	these	 tyrann 	 ical 	 	 figure 	 s 	 	who	would	 rehears 	 e 	 	,	not	just	the	orchestra	 a 	 s 	 	a	whole	,	but	 individual 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	it	,	 with 	 in 	 	an	inch	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
but	i	'm	happy	to	say	now	that	the	world	 ha 	 s 	 	 move 	 d 	 	on	,	music	 ha 	 s 	 	 move 	 d 	 	on	with	it	.
we	now	have	a	more	 democrat 	 ic 	 	view	and	way	of	making	music	--	a	two	-	way	street	.	i	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	conductor	,	have	to	come	to	the	 rehears 	 al 	 	with	a	cast	-	iron	sense	of	the	 out 	 er 	 	 architect 	 ure 	 	of	that	music	,	 with 	 in 	 	which	there	is	then	immense	personal	 free 	 dom 	 	for	the	 member 	 s 	 	of	the	orchestra	to	shine	.
for	 my 	 self 	 	,	of	course	,	i	have	to	 complete 	 ly 	 	trust	my	body	language	.
that	's	all	i	have	at	the	point	of	sale	.
it	's	silent	 gest 	 ure 	 	.
i	can	 hard 	 ly 	 	bark	out	 instruct 	 ions 	 	while	we	're	 play 	 ing 	 	.
 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	the	scottish	 en 	 s 	 em 	 ble 	 	.
so	in	order	for	all	 th 	 is 	 	to	work	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	i	have	got	to	be	in	a	position	of	trust	.
i	have	to	trust	the	orchestra	,	and	,	even	more	 cruci 	 ally 	 	,	i	have	to	trust	 my 	 self 	 	.
think	about	it	:	when	you	're	in	a	position	of	not	 trust 	 ing 	 	,	what	do	you	do	?
you	overcompensate	.
and	in	my	game	,	that	 mean 	 s 	 	you	 over 	 gesticul 	 ate 	 	.
you	end	up	like	some	kind	of	 ra 	 bid 	 	 wind 	 mill 	 	.
and	the	 big 	 ger 	 	your	 gest 	 ure 	 	 get 	 s 	 	,	the	more	ill	-	defined	,	 blur 	 ry 	 	and	,	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	 use 	 less 	 	it	is	to	the	orchestra	.
you	 be 	 come 	 	a	figure	of	 f 	 un 	 	.	there	's	no	trust	 any 	 more 	 	,	 on 	 ly 	 	 ridicul 	 e 	 	.
and	i	remember	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	my	 care 	 er 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	on	these	 dis 	 mal 	 	 out 	 ing 	 s 	 	with	 orchestra 	 s 	 	,	i	would	be	going	 complete 	 ly 	 	 insan 	 e 	 	on	the	 pod 	 ium 	 	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 en 	 gender 	 	a	small	scale	crescendo	 re 	 ally 	 	,	just	a	little	 up 	 s 	 urge 	 	in	volume	.
bugger	me	,	they	would	n't	give	it	to	me	.
i	 s 	 pent 	 	a	lot	of	time	in	 t 	 hose 	 	early	 year 	 s 	 	 weep 	 ing 	 	 silent 	 ly 	 	in	 dress 	 ing 	 	rooms	.
and	how	 fu 	 tile 	 	 seem 	 ed 	 	the	 word 	 s 	 	of	 ad 	 vice 	 	to	me	from	great	british	veteran	conductor	 s 	 ir 	 	colin	davis	who	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 conduct 	 ing 	 	,	charles	,	is	like	 hold 	 ing 	 	a	small	bird	in	your	hand	.
if	you	hold	it	too	 tight 	 ly 	 	,	you	crush	it	.
if	you	hold	it	too	 loose 	 ly 	 	,	it	flies	away	.	``
i	have	to	say	,	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 day 	 s 	 	,	i	could	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	even	find	the	bird	.
now	a	fundamental	and	 re 	 ally 	 	 visceral 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	experience	for	me	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	music	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	my	 adventure 	 s 	 	in	south	africa	,	the	most	 dizzy 	 ing 	 ly 	 	musical	country	on	the	planet	in	my	view	,	but	a	country	which	,	through	 it 	 s 	 	musical	culture	,	 ha 	 s 	 	taught	me	one	fundamental	 less 	 on 	 	:	that	through	music	making	can	come	deep	 level 	 s 	 	of	fundamental	life	-	giving	trust	.
back	in	2000	,	i	had	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	go	to	south	africa	to	form	a	new	opera	company	.
so	i	went	out	there	,	and	i	 audition 	 ed 	 	,	 main 	 ly 	 	in	 r 	 ural 	 	 town 	 ship 	 	 location 	 s 	 	,	right	around	the	country	.
i	heard	about	2,000	 s 	 ing 	 ers 	 	and	 pull 	 ed 	 	together	a	company	of	40	of	the	most	jaw	-	droppingly	 amaz 	 ing 	 	young	 perform 	 ers 	 	,	the	 major 	 ity 	 	of	whom	 we 	 re 	 	black	,	but	there	 we 	 re 	 	a	 hand 	 ful 	 	of	white	 perform 	 ers 	 	.
now	it	 emerge 	 d 	 	early	on	in	the	first	 rehears 	 al 	 	period	that	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	white	 perform 	 ers 	 	had	,	in	his	previous	incarnation	,	 be 	 en 	 	a	member	of	the	south	african	police	force	.
and	in	the	last	 year 	 s 	 	of	the	old	regime	,	he	would	 routine 	 ly 	 	be	 detail 	 ed 	 	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	 town 	 ship 	 	to	aggress	the	community	.
now	you	can	imagine	what	 th 	 is 	 	knowledge	did	to	the	temperature	in	the	room	,	the	general	atmosphere	.
let	's	be	under	no	 illusion 	 s 	 	.
in	south	africa	,	the	relationship	most	 de 	 void 	 	of	trust	is	that	between	a	white	 police 	 man 	 	and	the	black	community	.
so	how	do	we	 re 	 cover 	 	from	that	,	 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	?
 simpl 	 y 	 	through	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	.
we	 s 	 ang 	 	,	we	 s 	 ang 	 	,	we	 s 	 ang 	 	,	and	 amaz 	 ing 	 ly 	 	new	trust	grew	,	and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	 friend 	 ship 	 	 blossom 	 ed 	 	.
and	that	 show 	 ed 	 	me	 s 	 uch 	 	a	fundamental	truth	,	that	music	making	and	other	 form 	 s 	 	of	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	can	so	often	go	to	 place 	 s 	 	where	mere	 word 	 s 	 	can	not	.
so	we	got	some	 show 	 s 	 	off	the	ground	.	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 tour 	 ing 	 	them	 inter 	 national 	 ly 	 	.
one	of	them	was	``	carmen	.	``
we	then	thought	we	'd	make	a	movie	of	``	carmen	,	``	which	we	 record 	 ed 	 	and	shot	 out 	 side 	 	on	location	in	the	 town 	 ship 	 	 out 	 side 	 	cape	town	 call 	 ed 	 	khayelitsha	.
the	piece	was	 s 	 ung 	 	 entire 	 ly 	 	in	xhosa	,	which	is	a	 beaut 	 i 	 fully 	 	musical	language	,	if	you	do	n't	know	it	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	u	-	carmen	e-khayelitsha	``	--	 liter 	 ally 	 	``	carmen	of	khayelitsha	.	``
i	want	to	play	you	a	 tin 	 y 	 	clip	of	it	now	for	no	other	reason	than	to	give	you	proof	positive	that	there	is	 noth 	 ing 	 	 tin 	 y 	 	about	south	african	music	making	.
 some 	 thing 	 	which	i	find	 utter 	 ly 	 	 enchant 	 ing 	 	about	south	african	music	making	is	that	it	's	so	free	.
south	africans	just	make	music	 re 	 ally 	 	 free 	 ly 	 	.
and	i	think	,	in	no	small	way	,	that	's	due	to	one	fundamental	fact	:	they	're	not	bound	to	a	system	of	 not 	 ation 	 	.
they	do	n't	read	music	.
they	trust	 the 	 ir 	 	 ear 	 s 	 	.
you	can	teach	a	bunch	of	south	africans	a	tune	in	about	five	 second 	 s 	 	flat	.
and	then	,	 a 	 s 	 	if	by	magic	,	they	will	 spontane 	 ously 	 	 improv 	 ise 	 	a	load	of	 harmon 	 y 	 	around	that	tune	 be 	 cause 	 	they	can	.
now	 t 	 hose 	 	of	us	that	live	in	the	west	,	if	i	can	use	that	term	,	i	think	have	a	much	more	 hide 	 bound 	 	attitude	or	sense	of	music	--	that	 some 	 how 	 	it	's	all	about	skill	and	 system 	 s 	 	.
 there 	 fore 	 	it	's	the	exclusive	preserve	of	an	elite	,	 talent 	 ed 	 	body	.
and	yet	,	 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	every	single	one	of	us	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	 prob 	 ably 	 	 engage 	 s 	 	with	music	on	a	 dai 	 ly 	 	 bas 	 is 	 	.
and	if	i	can	 broad 	 en 	 	 th 	 is 	 	out	for	a	second	,	i	'm	 will 	 ing 	 	to	bet	that	every	single	one	of	you	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	would	be	happy	to	speak	with	 acu 	 ity 	 	,	with	total	confidence	,	about	 movie 	 s 	 	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	about	 liter 	 ature 	 	.
but	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	would	be	able	to	make	a	confident	 assert 	 ion 	 	about	a	piece	of	 classic 	 al 	 	music	?
why	is	 th 	 is 	 	?
and	what	i	'm	going	to	say	to	you	now	is	i	'm	just	 ur 	 ging 	 	you	to	get	over	 th 	 is 	 	 suprem 	 e 	 	lack	of	self	-	confidence	,	to	take	the	plunge	,	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	you	can	trust	your	 ear 	 s 	 	,	you	can	hear	some	of	the	fundamental	muscle	tissue	,	fiber	,	dna	,	what	 make 	 s 	 	a	great	piece	of	music	great	.
i	've	got	a	little	experiment	i	want	to	try	with	you	.
did	you	know	that	ted	is	a	tune	?
a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	tune	based	on	three	 note 	 s 	 	--	t	,	e	,	d	.
now	hang	on	a	minute	.
i	know	you	're	going	to	say	to	me	,	``	t	 do 	 es 	 	n't	exist	in	music	.	``
well	 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	there	's	a	time	-	 honor 	 ed 	 	system	,	which	 compose 	 rs 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	using	for	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	which	 prove 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	that	it	 do 	 es 	 	.
if	i	 s 	 ing 	 	you	a	musical	scale	:	a	,	b	,	c	,	d	,	e	,	f	,	g	--	and	i	just	carry	on	with	the	next	set	of	 letter 	 s 	 	in	the	 alpha 	 bet 	 	,	same	scale	:	h	,	i	,	j	,	k	,	l	,	m	,	n	,	o	,	p	,	q	,	r	,	s	,	t	--	there	you	go	.

so	t	is	f	.
so	t	,	e	,	d	is	the	same	 a 	 s 	 	f	,	e	,	d.	now	that	piece	of	music	that	we	 play 	 ed 	 	at	the	start	of	 th 	 is 	 	session	had	 enshrin 	 ed 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	heart	the	theme	,	which	is	ted	.
have	a	listen	.
do	you	hear	it	?
or	do	i	smell	some	doubt	in	the	room	?
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	we	'll	play	it	for	you	 aga 	 in 	 	now	,	and	we	're	going	to	 high 	 light 	 	,	we	're	going	to	poke	out	the	t	,	e	,	d	.
if	you	'll	 par 	 don 	 	the	 express 	 ion 	 	.
oh	my	 good 	 ness 	 	me	,	there	it	was	loud	and	clear	,	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	.
i	think	we	should	make	 th 	 is 	 	even	more	 ex 	 plicit 	 	.
 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	it	's	 near 	 ly 	 	time	for	tea	.
would	you	reckon	you	need	to	 s 	 ing 	 	for	your	tea	,	i	think	?
i	think	we	need	to	 s 	 ing 	 	for	our	tea	.
we	're	going	to	 s 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	three	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 note 	 s 	 	:	t	,	e	,	d	.
will	you	have	a	go	for	me	?

charles	hazlewood	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	you	sound	a	bit	more	like	 cow 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	than	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
 s 	 hall 	 	we	try	that	one	 aga 	 in 	 	?
and	look	,	if	you	're	 ad 	 vent 	 ur 	 ous 	 	,	you	go	up	the	octave	.
t	,	e	,	d	.

ch	:	once	more	with	 v 	 im 	 	.	there	i	am	like	a	 blood 	 y 	 	 wind 	 mill 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	,	you	see	.
now	we	're	going	to	put	that	in	the	 con 	 text 	 	of	the	music	.
the	music	will	start	,	and	then	at	a	signal	from	me	,	you	will	 s 	 ing 	 	that	.
one	more	time	,
with	 feel 	 ing 	 	,	 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	.
you	wo	n't	make	the	key	 other 	 wise 	 	.
well	 d 	 one 	 	,	 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	.
it	was	n't	a	bad	debut	for	the	ted	choir	,	not	a	bad	debut	at	all	.
now	there	's	a	project	that	i	'm	 initi 	 ating 	 	at	the	moment	that	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	and	 want 	 ed 	 	to	share	with	you	,
 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	all	about	changing	 per 	 ception 	 s 	 	,	and	,	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	building	a	new	level	of	trust	.
the	 young 	 est 	 	of	my	children	was	born	with	cerebral	 pal 	 s 	 y 	 	,	which	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	imagine	,	if	you	do	n't	have	an	experience	of	it	 your 	 self 	 	,	is	 quit 	 e 	 	a	big	thing	to	take	on	board	.
but	the	gift	that	my	 gorge 	 ous 	 	daughter	 ha 	 s 	 	 give 	 n 	 	me	,	 a 	 side 	 	from	her	 ver 	 y 	 	 exist 	 ence 	 	,	is	that	it	's	 open 	 ed 	 	my	 eye 	 s 	 	to	a	whole	stretch	of	the	community	that	was	 hither 	 to 	 	 hid 	 den 	 	,	the	community	of	 dis 	 able 	 d 	 	people	.
and	i	found	 my 	 self 	 	looking	at	the	paralympics	and	 think 	 ing 	 	how	 in 	 credible 	 	how	technology	's	 be 	 en 	 	 harness 	 ed 	 	to	prove	beyond	doubt	that	 dis 	 ability 	 	is	no	 bar 	 rier 	 	to	the	highest	 level 	 s 	 	of	 s 	 port 	 ing 	 	 achiev 	 ement 	 	.
of	course	there	's	a	 grim 	 mer 	 	side	to	that	truth	,	which	is	that	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	taken	 decade 	 s 	 	for	the	world	at	large	to	come	to	a	position	of	trust	,	to	 re 	 ally 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 dis 	 ability 	 	and	 s 	 port 	 s 	 	can	go	together	in	a	convincing	and	 interest 	 ing 	 	fashion	.
so	i	find	 my 	 self 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	:	where	is	music	in	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	?
you	ca	n't	tell	me	that	there	are	n't	 million 	 s 	 	of	 dis 	 able 	 d 	 	people	,	in	the	u.k.	 al 	 one 	 	,	with	massive	musical	potential	.
so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	create	a	platform	for	that	potential	.
it	's	going	to	be	britain	's	first	ever	national	 dis 	 able 	 d 	 	orchestra	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	paraorchestra	.
i	'm	going	to	show	you	a	clip	now	of	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	improvisation	session	that	we	had	.
it	was	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	moment	.
just	me	and	four	 astonish 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 gift 	 ed 	 	 dis 	 able 	 d 	 	 music 	 ians 	 	.
 normal 	 ly 	 	when	you	 improv 	 ise 	 	--	and	i	do	it	all	the	time	around	the	world	--	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	 initi 	 al 	 	period	of	 horr 	 or 	 	,	like	 every 	 one 	 	's	too	 frighten 	 ed 	 	to	throw	the	hat	 in 	 to 	 	the	ring	,
an	awful	 pregn 	 ant 	 	silence	.
then	 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	if	by	magic	,	bang	!	we	're	all	in	there	and	it	's	complete	 bed 	 lam 	 	.	you	ca	n't	hear	 any 	 thing 	 	.
no	one	's	 listen 	 ing 	 	.	no	one	's	 trust 	 ing 	 	.

can	i	do	that	one	 aga 	 in 	 	?

there	's	so	much	joy	and	 thing 	 s 	 	i	could	get	from	 play 	 ing 	 	an	instrument	and	 perform 	 ing 	 	.

so	 give 	 n 	 	the	prince	 love 	 d 	 	his	music	,	haydn	thought	he	'd	write	a	 sym 	 phony 	 	to	make	the	point	.
and	we	're	going	to	play	just	the	 ver 	 y 	 	tail	end	of	 th 	 is 	 	 sym 	 phony 	 	now	.
and	you	'll	see	the	orchestra	in	a	kind	of	 s 	 ull 	 en 	 	revolt	.
i	'm	 pleas 	 ed 	 	to	say	,	the	prince	did	take	the	tip	from	the	 orchestra 	 l 	 	performance	,	and	the	 music 	 ians 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 unit 	 ed 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	.
but	i	think	it	 sum 	 s 	 	up	my	talk	 ra 	 ther 	 	well	,	 th 	 is 	 	,	that	where	there	is	trust	,	there	is	music	--	by	 extens 	 ion 	 	life	.
where	there	is	no	trust	,	the	music	 quit 	 e 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	 with 	 ers 	 	away	.
