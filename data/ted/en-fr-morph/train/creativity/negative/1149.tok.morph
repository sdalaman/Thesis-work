so	i	want	to	take	you	on	a	trip	to	an	alien	world	.
and	it	's	not	a	trip	that	 requir 	 es 	 	light	-	 year 	 s 	 	of	travel	,	but	it	's	to	a	place	where	it	's	defined	by	light	.
so	it	's	a	little	-	 appreciate 	 d 	 	fact	that	most	of	the	 animal 	 s 	 	in	our	ocean	make	light	.
i	've	 s 	 pent 	 	most	of	my	 care 	 er 	 	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 phenomen 	 on 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nce 	 	.
i	 stud 	 y 	 	it	 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	 understand 	 ing 	 	it	is	critical	to	 understand 	 ing 	 	life	in	the	ocean	where	most	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nce 	 	 occur 	 s 	 	.
i	 al 	 so 	 	use	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	tool	for	 visual 	 izing 	 	and	 track 	 ing 	 	 poll 	 ution 	 	.
but	 most 	 ly 	 	i	'm	 en 	 trance 	 d 	 	by	it	.
since	my	my	first	 d 	 ive 	 	in	a	deep	-	 div 	 ing 	 	submersible	,	when	i	went	down	and	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	the	 light 	 s 	 	and	saw	the	 fire 	 work 	 s 	 	 dis 	 play 	 s 	 	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	a	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nce 	 	 junk 	 y 	 	.
but	i	would	come	back	from	 t 	 hose 	 	 div 	 es 	 	and	try	to	share	the	experience	with	 word 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 total 	 ly 	 	 in 	 ad 	 equate 	 	to	the	task	.
i	 need 	 ed 	 	some	way	to	share	the	experience	 direct 	 ly 	 	.
and	the	first	time	i	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	that	way	was	in	 th 	 is 	 	little	single	-	person	submersible	 call 	 ed 	 	deep	 r 	 over 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	next	video	clip	,	you	're	going	to	see	how	we	 stimul 	 ated 	 	the	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nce 	 	.
and	the	first	thing	you	're	going	to	see	is	a	 trans 	 ect 	 	screen	that	is	about	a	meter	 a 	 cross 	 	.
 nar 	 rator 	 	:	in	front	of	the	sub	,	a	mess	screen	will	come	 in 	 to 	 	contact	with	the	soft	-	bodied	 creature 	 s 	 	of	the	deep	sea	.
with	the	sub	's	 light 	 s 	 	 s 	 witch 	 ed 	 	off	,	it	is	possible	to	see	 the 	 ir 	 	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nce 	 	--	the	light	 produce 	 d 	 	when	they	collide	with	the	mesh	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	time	it	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	 be 	 en 	 	 record 	 ed 	 	.
edith	widder	:	so	i	 record 	 ed 	 	that	with	an	 intens 	 ified 	 	video	camera	that	 ha 	 s 	 	about	the	 sensitiv 	 ity 	 	of	the	fully	dark	-	 adapt 	 ed 	 	human	eye	.
which	 mean 	 s 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	is	what	you	would	see	if	you	took	a	 d 	 ive 	 	in	a	submersible	.
but	just	to	try	to	prove	that	fact	to	you	,	i	've	 br 	 ought 	 	 a 	 long 	 	some	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nt 	 	plankton	in	what	is	 un 	 doubt 	 ed 	 ly 	 	a	 fool 	 hard 	 y 	 	attempt	at	a	live	 demonst 	 ration 	 	.
so	,	if	we	could	have	the	 light 	 s 	 	down	and	have	it	 a 	 s 	 	dark	in	here	 a 	 s 	 	possible	,	i	have	a	flask	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nt 	 	plankton	in	it	.
and	you	'll	note	there	's	no	light	coming	from	them	right	now	,	either	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	dead	--	or	 be 	 cause 	 	i	need	to	stir	them	up	in	some	way	for	you	to	see	what	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nce 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
 oop 	 s 	 	.	sorry	.
i	 s 	 pend 	 	most	of	my	time	 work 	 ing 	 	in	the	dark	;	i	'm	used	to	that	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
so	that	light	was	made	by	a	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nt 	 	 dinofla 	 gel 	 late 	 	,	a	single	-	celled	 al 	 ga 	 	.
so	why	would	a	single	-	celled	 al 	 ga 	 	need	to	be	able	to	produce	light	?
well	,	it	uses	it	to	defend	 it 	 self 	 	from	 it 	 s 	 	 predator 	 s 	 	.
the	flash	is	like	a	 s 	 cream 	 	for	help	.
it	's	what	's	known	 a 	 s 	 	a	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nt 	 	burglar	alarm	,
and	just	like	the	alarm	on	your	car	or	your	house	,	it	's	 me 	 ant 	 	to	cast	 un 	 want 	 ed 	 	attention	onto	the	 intrud 	 er 	 	,	 there 	 by 	 	either	 lead 	 ing 	 	to	his	capture	or	 scar 	 ing 	 	him	away	.
there	's	a	lot	of	 animal 	 s 	 	that	use	 th 	 is 	 	trick	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	 th 	 is 	 	black	 dragon 	 fish 	 	.
it	's	got	a	light	organ	under	 it 	 s 	 	eye	.
it	's	got	a	chin	 barb 	 el 	 	.
it	's	got	a	lot	of	other	light	 organ 	 s 	 	you	ca	n't	see	,	but	you	'll	see	in	here	in	a	minute	.
so	we	had	to	chase	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	submersible	for	 quit 	 e 	 	 some 	 time 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	top	speed	of	 th 	 is 	 	fish	is	one	knot	,	which	was	the	top	speed	of	the	submersible	.
but	it	was	worth	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	caught	it	in	a	special	capture	 de 	 vice 	 	,	 br 	 ought 	 	it	up	 in 	 to 	 	the	lab	on	the	ship	,	and	then	 every 	 thing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	fish	 light 	 s 	 	up	.
it	's	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	.
the	light	 organ 	 s 	 	under	the	 eye 	 s 	 	are	 flash 	 ing 	 	.
that	chin	 barb 	 el 	 	is	 flash 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	got	light	 organ 	 s 	 	on	 it 	 s 	 	 bel 	 ly 	 	that	are	 flash 	 ing 	 	,	fin	 light 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	 s 	 cream 	 	for	help	;	it	's	 me 	 ant 	 	to	attract	attention	.
it	's	 phenomen 	 al 	 	.
and	you	 normal 	 ly 	 	do	n't	get	to	see	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	've	 exhaust 	 ed 	 	the	 luminesce 	 nce 	 	when	we	 br 	 ing 	 	them	up	in	 net 	 s 	 	.
there	's	other	ways	you	can	defend	 your 	 self 	 	with	light	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	shrimp	 re 	 lease 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nt 	 	 chemical 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	water	just	the	way	a	 s 	 quid 	 	or	an	 oct 	 opus 	 	would	 re 	 lease 	 	an	ink	cloud	.
 th 	 is 	 	 blind 	 s 	 	or	 distract 	 s 	 	the	predator	.
 th 	 is 	 	little	 s 	 quid 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	fire	 shoot 	 er 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 it 	 s 	 	ability	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
now	it	may	look	like	a	tasty	morsel	,	or	a	pig	's	head	with	 wing 	 s 	 	--	but	if	it	's	 attack 	 ed 	 	,	it	 put 	 s 	 	out	a	 bar 	 rage 	 	of	light	--	in	fact	,	a	 bar 	 rage 	 	of	 photo 	 n 	 	 torpedo 	 es 	 	.
i	just	 bare 	 ly 	 	got	the	 light 	 s 	 	out	in	time	for	you	to	be	able	to	see	 t 	 hose 	 	 gob 	 s 	 	of	light	hitting	the	 trans 	 ect 	 	screen	and	then	just	 glow 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	 phenomen 	 al 	 	.
so	there	's	a	lot	of	 animal 	 s 	 	in	the	open	ocean	--	most	of	them	that	make	light	.
and	we	have	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	idea	,	for	most	of	them	,	why	.
they	use	it	for	 find 	 ing 	 	food	,	for	 attract 	 ing 	 	 mate 	 s 	 	,	for	 defend 	 ing 	 	against	 predator 	 s 	 	.
but	when	you	get	down	to	the	bottom	of	the	ocean	,	that	's	where	 thing 	 s 	 	get	 re 	 ally 	 	strange	.
and	some	of	these	 animal 	 s 	 	are	 prob 	 ably 	 	inspiration	for	the	 thing 	 s 	 	you	saw	in	``	avatar	,	``
but	you	do	n't	have	to	travel	to	pandora	to	see	them	.
they	're	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 gold 	 en 	 	coral	,	a	bush	.
it	 grow 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	.
in	fact	,	it	's	thought	that	some	of	these	are	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	3,000	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	which	is	one	reason	that	bottom	 trawl 	 ing 	 	should	not	be	 allow 	 ed 	 	.
the	other	reason	is	 th 	 is 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	bush	 glow 	 s 	 	.
so	if	you	brush	up	against	it	,	any	place	you	 brush 	 ed 	 	against	it	,	you	get	 th 	 is 	 	 twinkl 	 ing 	 	blue	-	green	light	that	's	just	 breath 	 taking 	 	.
and	you	see	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	 some 	 thing 	 	out	of	a	dr.	seuss	book	--	just	all	manner	of	 creature 	 s 	 	all	over	 th 	 is 	 	thing	.
and	these	are	 fly 	 trap 	 	 ane 	 mon 	 es 	 	.
now	if	you	poke	it	,	it	 pull 	 s 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	 tent 	 acle 	 s 	 	.
but	if	you	keep	 po 	 king 	 	it	,	it	 start 	 s 	 	to	produce	light	.
and	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 end 	 s 	 	up	looking	like	a	 galax 	 y 	 	.
it	 produce 	 s 	 	these	 string 	 s 	 	of	light	,	 pre 	 sum 	 ably 	 	 a 	 s 	 	some	form	of	defense	.
there	are	 star 	 fish 	 	that	can	make	light	.
and	there	are	brittle	 star 	 s 	 	that	produce	 band 	 s 	 	of	light	that	dance	 a 	 long 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 arm 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	plant	,	but	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	an	animal	.
and	it	 anchor 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	in	the	sand	by	 blow 	 ing 	 	up	a	balloon	on	the	end	of	 it 	 s 	 	stock	.
so	it	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	hold	 it 	 self 	 	in	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	 current 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	see	here	.
but	if	we	collect	it	 ver 	 y 	 	 gent 	 ly 	 	,	and	we	 br 	 ing 	 	it	up	 in 	 to 	 	the	lab	and	just	 squeez 	 e 	 	it	at	the	base	of	the	stock	,	it	 produce 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	light	that	 propag 	 ates 	 	from	stem	to	the	plume	,	changing	color	 a 	 s 	 	it	 go 	 es 	 	,	from	green	to	blue	.
colorization	and	sound	 effect 	 s 	 	 add 	 ed 	 	for	you	 view 	 ing 	 	pleasure	.
but	we	have	no	idea	why	it	 do 	 es 	 	that	.
here	's	 an 	 other 	 	one	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	a	sea	pen	.
it	's	got	a	brittle	star	 hitch 	 ing 	 	a	ride	.
it	's	a	green	 s 	 ab 	 er 	 	of	light	.
and	like	the	one	you	just	saw	,	it	can	produce	these	 a 	 s 	 	 band 	 s 	 	of	light	.
so	if	i	 squeez 	 e 	 	the	base	,	the	 band 	 s 	 	go	from	base	to	tip	.
if	i	 squeez 	 e 	 	the	tip	,	they	go	from	tip	to	base	.
so	what	do	you	think	 happen 	 s 	 	if	you	 squeez 	 e 	 	it	in	the	middle	?
i	'd	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	your	 the 	 ories 	 	about	what	that	's	about	.
so	there	's	a	language	of	light	in	the	deep	ocean	,	and	we	're	just	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	understand	it	,
and	one	way	we	're	going	about	that	is	we	're	 imit 	 ating 	 	a	lot	of	these	 dis 	 play 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	optical	lure	that	i	've	used	.
we	call	it	the	 electron 	 ic 	 	 jelly 	 fish 	 	.
it	's	just	16	blue	leds	that	we	can	program	to	do	different	 type 	 s 	 	of	 dis 	 play 	 s 	 	.
and	we	view	it	with	a	camera	system	i	 develop 	 ed 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	eye	-	in	-	the	-	sea	that	uses	far	red	light	that	's	 in 	 visible 	 	to	most	 animal 	 s 	 	,	so	it	's	 un 	 obt 	 rus 	 ive 	 	.
so	i	just	want	to	show	you	some	of	the	 respons 	 es 	 	we	've	 elicit 	 ed 	 	from	 animal 	 s 	 	in	the	deep	sea	.
so	the	camera	's	black	and	white	.
it	's	not	high	-	 re 	 solution 	 	.
and	what	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	here	is	a	bait	box	with	a	bunch	of	--	like	the	 cock 	 roach 	 es 	 	of	the	ocean	--	there	are	 iso 	 pods 	 	all	over	it	.
and	right	in	the	front	is	the	 electron 	 ic 	 	 jelly 	 fish 	 	.
and	when	it	 start 	 s 	 	 flash 	 ing 	 	,	it	's	just	going	to	be	one	of	the	leds	that	's	 flash 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	fast	.	but	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	it	 start 	 s 	 	to	flash	--	and	it	's	going	to	look	big	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 bloom 	 s 	 	on	the	camera	--	i	want	you	to	look	right	here	.
there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	small	there	that	 respond 	 s 	 	.	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	 some 	 thing 	 	.
it	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	little	of	string	 pearl 	 s 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	--	in	fact	,	three	 string 	 s 	 	of	 pearl 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 consist 	 ent 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	in	the	bahamas	at	about	2,000	feet	.
we	 bas 	 ically 	 	have	a	chat	room	going	on	here	,	 be 	 cause 	 	once	it	 get 	 s 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	,	 every 	 body 	 	's	 talk 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	shrimp	that	's	 re 	 leas 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nt 	 	 chemical 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	water	.
but	the	cool	thing	is	,	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	it	.
we	do	n't	know	what	we	're	 say 	 ing 	 	.
 personal 	 ly 	 	,	i	think	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	sexy	.
and	then	 final 	 ly 	 	,	i	want	to	show	you	some	 respons 	 es 	 	that	we	 record 	 ed 	 	with	the	world	's	first	deep	-	sea	 web 	 cam 	 	,	which	we	had	 install 	 ed 	 	in	monterey	canyon	last	year	.
we	've	 on 	 ly 	 	just	 beg 	 un 	 	to	 analyz 	 e 	 	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	data	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	be	a	 glow 	 ing 	 	source	first	,	which	is	like	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nt 	 	bacteria	.
and	it	is	an	optical	cue	that	there	's	 car 	 r 	 ion 	 	on	the	bottom	of	the	ocean	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 scavenge 	 r 	 	 come 	 s 	 	in	,	which	is	a	giant	 six 	 gill 	 	 s 	 hark 	 	.
and	i	ca	n't	claim	for	 s 	 ure 	 	that	the	optical	source	 br 	 ought 	 	it	in	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	bait	right	there	.
but	if	it	had	 be 	 en 	 	 follow 	 ing 	 	the	odor	plume	,	it	would	have	come	in	from	the	other	direction	.
and	it	 do 	 es 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	seem	to	be	 try 	 ing 	 	to	eat	the	 electron 	 ic 	 	 jelly 	 fish 	 	.
that	's	a	12	-	foot	-	long	giant	 six 	 gill 	 	 s 	 hark 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	next	one	is	from	the	 web 	 cam 	 	,	and	it	's	going	to	be	 th 	 is 	 	 pin 	 wheel 	 	 dis 	 play 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	burglar	alarm	.
and	that	was	a	humboldt	 s 	 quid 	 	,	a	juvenile	humboldt	 s 	 quid 	 	,	about	three	feet	long	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	at	3,000	feet	in	monterey	canyon	.
but	if	it	's	a	burglar	alarm	,	you	would	n't	expect	it	to	attack	the	 jelly 	 fish 	 	 direct 	 ly 	 	.
it	's	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	 attack 	 ing 	 	what	's	 attack 	 ing 	 	the	 jelly 	 fish 	 	.
but	we	did	see	a	bunch	of	 respons 	 es 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	guy	is	a	little	more	 contempl 	 ative 	 	.
``	 he 	 y 	 	,	wait	a	minute	.
there	's	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	 some 	 thing 	 	else	there	.	``
he	's	 think 	 ing 	 	about	it	.
but	he	's	 persist 	 ent 	 	.
he	 keep 	 s 	 	coming	back	.
and	then	he	 go 	 es 	 	away	for	a	few	 second 	 s 	 	to	think	about	it	some	more	,	and	 think 	 s 	 	,	``	 may 	 be 	 	if	i	come	in	from	a	different	angle	.	``
nope	.
so	we	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	get	a	handle	on	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	 on 	 ly 	 	just	the	 begin 	 ning 	 s 	 	.
we	need	more	 eye 	 s 	 	on	the	process	.
so	if	any	of	you	ever	get	a	chance	to	take	a	 d 	 ive 	 	in	a	submersible	,	by	all	 mean 	 s 	 	,	climb	in	and	take	the	plunge	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	should	be	on	 every 	 body 	 	's	 buck 	 et 	 	list	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	live	on	an	ocean	planet	.
more	than	90	percent	,	99	percent	,	of	the	living	space	on	our	planet	is	ocean	.
it	's	a	 magic 	 al 	 	place	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	 breath 	 taking 	 	light	 show 	 s 	 	and	bizarre	and	 won 	 dr 	 ous 	 	 creature 	 s 	 	,	alien	life	 form 	 s 	 	that	you	do	n't	have	to	travel	to	 an 	 other 	 	planet	to	see	.
but	if	you	do	take	the	plunge	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	remember	to	turn	out	the	 light 	 s 	 	.
but	i	 war 	 n 	 	you	,	it	's	 addict 	 ive 	 	.
thank	you	.
