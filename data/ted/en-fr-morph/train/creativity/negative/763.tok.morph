i	am	going	to	speak	about	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	,	but	i	would	like	to	 juxta 	 pose 	 	two	different	 thing 	 s 	 	.
one	is	the	large	global	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	the	large	 global 	 ized 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	and	the	other	one	is	the	small	,	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 limit 	 ed 	 	,	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	of	our	 tradition 	 al 	 	 government 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 inter 	 national 	 	 institution 	 s 	 	to	govern	,	to	shape	,	 th 	 is 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	there	is	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 symmetry 	 	,	which	 create 	 s 	 	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	 fail 	 ing 	 	 govern 	 ance 	 	.
 fail 	 ing 	 	 govern 	 ance 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	 area 	 s 	 	:	in	the	area	of	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	and	the	area	of	 destruct 	 ion 	 	of	the	environment	,	in	the	area	of	 exploit 	 ation 	 	of	women	and	children	,	in	the	area	of	climate	change	,
in	all	the	 area 	 s 	 	in	which	we	 re 	 ally 	 	need	a	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	 re 	 introduc 	 e 	 	the	 prim 	 acy 	 	of	 politic 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	which	is	 oper 	 ating 	 	in	a	 world 	 wide 	 	arena	.
and	i	think	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	,	and	the	fight	against	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	,	and	the	impact	of	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	,	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	one	of	the	most	 interest 	 ing 	 	ways	to	 illustr 	 ate 	 	what	i	mean	with	 th 	 is 	 	failure	of	 govern 	 ance 	 	.
let	me	talk	about	my	own	experience	.
i	used	to	work	 a 	 s 	 	the	director	of	the	world	bank	 off 	 ice 	 	in	nairobi	for	east	africa	.
at	that	time	,	i	 notice 	 d 	 	that	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	,	that	grand	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	,	that	 system 	 atic 	 	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	,	was	 under 	 min 	 ing 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	.
and	 there 	 fore 	 	,	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	not	 on 	 ly 	 	try	to	protect	the	work	of	the	world	bank	,	our	own	 project 	 s 	 	,	our	own	 program 	 s 	 	against	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	,	but	in	general	,	i	thought	,	``	we	need	a	system	to	protect	the	people	in	 th 	 is 	 	part	of	the	world	from	the	 ravage 	 s 	 	of	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	.	``	and	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	work	,	i	 receiv 	 ed 	 	a	 memor 	 and 	 um 	 	from	the	world	bank	,	from	the	legal	 depart 	 ment 	 	first	,	in	which	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	are	not	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
you	are	 meddl 	 ing 	 	in	the	internal	 af 	 fair 	 s 	 	of	our	partner	 count 	 ries 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 forbid 	 den 	 	by	the	 chart 	 er 	 	of	the	world	bank	,
so	i	want	you	to	stop	your	 do 	 ing 	 s 	 	.	``
in	the	 mean 	 time 	 	,	i	was	 chair 	 ing 	 	donor	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	in	which	the	 vari 	 ous 	 	 donor 	 s 	 	,	and	 man 	 y 	 	of	them	like	to	be	in	nairobi	--	it	is	true	,	it	is	one	of	the	 un 	 safe 	 st 	 	cities	of	the	world	,	but	they	like	to	be	there	 be 	 cause 	 	the	other	cities	are	even	less	 comfort 	 able 	 	.
and	in	these	donor	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	i	 notice 	 d 	 	that	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	worst	 project 	 s 	 	--	which	 we 	 re 	 	put	forward	by	our	 client 	 s 	 	,	by	the	 government 	 s 	 	,	by	 promote 	 rs 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	them	 represent 	 ing 	 	 suppli 	 ers 	 	from	the	north	--	that	the	worst	 project 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 real 	 ized 	 	first	.
let	me	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	:
a	huge	power	project	,	300	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	to	be	built	 s 	 mack 	 	 in 	 to 	 	one	of	the	most	 vulner 	 able 	 	,	and	one	of	the	most	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	 area 	 s 	 	of	western	kenya	.
and	we	all	 notice 	 d 	 	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	project	had	no	economic	 benefit 	 s 	 	:
it	had	no	 client 	 s 	 	,	 no 	 body 	 	would	buy	the	 electric 	 ity 	 	there	,
 no 	 body 	 	was	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 irrig 	 ation 	 	 project 	 s 	 	.
to	the	 contr 	 ary 	 	,	we	 k 	 new 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	project	would	destroy	the	environment	:	it	would	destroy	 rip 	 arian 	 	 forest 	 s 	 	,	which	 we 	 re 	 	the	 bas 	 is 	 	for	the	 surviv 	 al 	 	of	 nomad 	 ic 	 	 group 	 s 	 	,	the	samburu	and	the	turkana	in	 th 	 is 	 	area	.
so	 every 	 body 	 	 k 	 new 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	,	not	a	 use 	 less 	 	project	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	absolute	 dam 	 aging 	 	,	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	project	--	not	to	speak	about	the	future	 indebted 	 ness 	 	of	the	country	for	these	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 siphon 	 ing 	 	off	of	the	scarce	 resource 	 s 	 	of	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	from	much	more	 import 	 ant 	 	 activ 	 ities 	 	like	 school 	 s 	 	,	like	 hospital 	 s 	 	and	so	on	.
and	yet	,	we	all	 reject 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	project	,
 non 	 e 	 	of	the	 donor 	 s 	 	was	 will 	 ing 	 	to	have	 the 	 ir 	 	name	 connect 	 ed 	 	with	it	,	and	it	was	the	first	project	to	be	 implement 	 ed 	 	.
the	good	 project 	 s 	 	,	which	we	 a 	 s 	 	a	donor	community	would	take	under	our	 wing 	 s 	 	,	they	took	 year 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	you	had	too	 man 	 y 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	,	and	 ver 	 y 	 	often	they	did	n't	succeed	.
but	these	bad	 project 	 s 	 	,	which	 we 	 re 	 	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 dam 	 aging 	 	--	for	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	for	 man 	 y 	 	 generation 	 s 	 	,	for	the	environment	,	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	who	had	to	be	 re 	 settl 	 ed 	 	--
they	 we 	 re 	 	 sudden 	 ly 	 	put	together	by	 con 	 sort 	 ia 	 	of	 bank 	 s 	 	,	of	 suppli 	 er 	 	 age 	 ncies 	 	,	of	 insur 	 ance 	 	 age 	 ncies 	 	--	like	in	germany	,	hermes	,	and	so	on	--	and	they	came	back	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	driven	by	an	 un 	 holy 	 	alliance	between	the	 power 	 ful 	 	 elite 	 s 	 	in	the	 count 	 ries 	 	there	and	the	 suppli 	 ers 	 	from	the	north	.
now	,	these	 suppli 	 ers 	 	 we 	 re 	 	our	big	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	the	 act 	 ors 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	global	market	,	which	i	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	in	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	the	siemenses	of	 th 	 is 	 	world	,	coming	from	france	,	from	the	uk	,	from	japan	,	from	canada	,	from	germany	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 system 	 at 	 ically 	 	driven	by	 system 	 atic 	 	,	large	-	scale	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	.
we	are	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	50,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	here	,	or	100,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	there	,	or	one	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	there	.
no	,	we	are	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	10	million	,	20	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	on	the	swiss	bank	 account 	 s 	 	,	on	the	bank	 account 	 s 	 	of	liechtenstein	,	of	the	 p 	 resident 	 	's	 mini 	 sters 	 	,	the	high	 official 	 s 	 	in	the	para	-	statal	 sector 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	the	 re 	 ality 	 	which	i	saw	,	and	not	 on 	 ly 	 	one	project	like	that	:	i	saw	,	i	would	say	,	over	the	 year 	 s 	 	i	 work 	 ed 	 	in	africa	,	i	saw	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 project 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	so	,	i	 be 	 came 	 	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	that	it	is	 th 	 is 	 	 system 	 atic 	 	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	which	is	 per 	 vert 	 ing 	 	economic	policy	-	making	in	these	 count 	 ries 	 	,	which	is	the	main	reason	for	the	 mis 	 ery 	 	,	for	the	poverty	,	for	the	 conflict 	 s 	 	,	for	the	violence	,	for	the	 de 	 s 	 per 	 ation 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	of	these	 count 	 ries 	 	.
that	we	have	 to 	 day 	 	more	than	a	billion	people	 be 	 low 	 	the	absolute	poverty	line	,	that	we	have	more	than	a	billion	people	 with 	 out 	 	proper	 drink 	 ing 	 	water	in	the	world	,	twice	that	number	,	more	than	two	billion	people	 with 	 out 	 	 sanit 	 ation 	 	and	so	on	,	and	the	 con 	 sequent 	 	 ill 	 ness 	 es 	 	of	 mother 	 s 	 	and	children	,	still	,	child	 mortal 	 ity 	 	of	more	than	10	million	people	every	year	,	children	 dy 	 ing 	 	before	they	are	five	 year 	 s 	 	old	:
the	cause	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	to	a	large	 ex 	 tent 	 	,	grand	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	.
now	,	why	did	the	world	bank	not	let	me	do	 th 	 is 	 	work	?
i	found	out	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	after	i	left	,	under	a	big	fight	,	the	world	bank	.
the	reason	was	that	the	 member 	 s 	 	of	the	world	bank	thought	that	foreign	 bribe 	 ry 	 	was	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	germany	.
in	germany	,	foreign	 bribe 	 ry 	 	was	 allow 	 ed 	 	.
it	was	even	tax	-	 deduct 	 ible 	 	.
no	wonder	that	most	of	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 inter 	 national 	 	 oper 	 ators 	 	in	germany	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	in	france	and	the	uk	and	scandinavia	,	 every 	 where 	 	,	 system 	 at 	 ically 	 	 bribe 	 d 	 	.
not	all	of	them	,	but	most	of	them	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 phenomen 	 on 	 	which	i	call	 fail 	 ing 	 	 govern 	 ance 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	when	i	then	came	to	germany	and	 start 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	little	ngo	here	in	berlin	,	at	the	villa	borsig	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	told	,	``	you	can	not	stop	our	german	 export 	 ers 	 	from	 b 	 rib 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	will	lose	our	 contract 	 s 	 	.
we	will	lose	to	the	french	,	we	will	lose	to	the	swedes	,	we	'll	lose	to	the	japanese	.	``	and	 there 	 fore 	 	,	there	was	a	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	a	prisoner	's	dilemma	,	which	made	it	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	for	an	individual	company	,	an	individual	 export 	 ing 	 	country	to	say	,	``	we	are	not	going	to	 continu 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 dead 	 ly 	 	,	 dis 	 astro 	 us 	 	habit	of	large	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	to	bribe	.	``
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	mean	with	a	 fail 	 ing 	 	 govern 	 ance 	 	structure	,	 be 	 cause 	 	even	the	 power 	 ful 	 	government	,	which	we	have	in	germany	,	 compar 	 ative 	 ly 	 	,	was	not	able	to	say	,	``	we	will	not	allow	our	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	to	bribe	 a 	 broad 	 	.	``
they	 need 	 ed 	 	help	,	and	the	large	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	have	 th 	 is 	 	dilemma	.
 man 	 y 	 	of	them	did	n't	want	to	bribe	.
 man 	 y 	 	of	the	german	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	 believ 	 e 	 	that	they	are	 re 	 ally 	 	producing	a	high	-	quality	product	at	a	good	price	,	so	they	are	 ver 	 y 	 	competitive	.
they	are	not	 a 	 s 	 	good	at	 b 	 rib 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 inter 	 national 	 	 competitor 	 s 	 	are	,	but	they	 we 	 re 	 	not	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	show	 the 	 ir 	 	 strength 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	world	was	eaten	up	by	grand	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	why	i	'm	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	 th 	 is 	 	:	civil	 socie 	 ty 	 	rose	to	the	occasion	.
we	had	 th 	 is 	 	small	ngo	,	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	 inter 	 national 	 	.
they	 beg 	 an 	 	to	think	of	an	 es 	 cape 	 	route	from	 th 	 is 	 	prisoner	's	dilemma	,	and	we	 develop 	 ed 	 	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	of	 collect 	 ive 	 	action	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	 vari 	 ous 	 	 competitor 	 s 	 	together	around	the	table	,	 explain 	 ing 	 	to	all	of	them	how	much	it	would	be	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 interest 	 s 	 	if	they	 simultaneous 	 ly 	 	would	stop	 b 	 rib 	 ing 	 	,	and	to	make	a	long	story	short	,	we	 manage 	 d 	 	to	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	get	germany	to	sign	together	with	the	other	oecd	 count 	 ries 	 	and	a	few	other	 export 	 ers 	 	.
in	1997	,	a	convention	,	under	the	 au 	 spice 	 s 	 	of	the	oecd	,	which	 oblig 	 ed 	 	 every 	 body 	 	to	change	 the 	 ir 	 	 law 	 s 	 	and	 criminal 	 ize 	 	foreign	 bribe 	 ry 	 	.
well	,	thank	you	.	i	mean	,	it	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	in	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	had	to	 s 	 it 	 	together	with	the	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.
we	had	here	in	berlin	,	at	the	aspen	institute	on	the	wannsee	,	we	had	 session 	 s 	 	with	about	20	 cap 	 tain 	 s 	 	of	industry	,	and	we	 discuss 	 ed 	 	with	them	what	to	do	about	 inter 	 national 	 	 bribe 	 ry 	 	.
in	the	first	session	--	we	had	three	 session 	 s 	 	over	the	course	of	two	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	 p 	 resident 	 	von	weizsäcker	,	by	the	way	,	 chair 	 ed 	 	one	of	the	 session 	 s 	 	,	the	first	one	,	to	take	the	fear	away	from	the	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	,	who	 we 	 re 	 	not	used	to	deal	with	non	-	 government 	 al 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	.
and	in	the	first	session	,	they	all	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 bribe 	 ry 	 	,	what	we	are	 do 	 ing 	 	.	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	 custom 	 ary 	 	there	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	these	other	 culture 	 s 	 	demand	.
they	even	applaud	it	.
in	fact	,	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	still	 say 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	so	there	are	still	a	lot	of	people	who	are	not	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	that	you	have	to	stop	 b 	 rib 	 ing 	 	.
but	in	the	second	session	,	they	admitted	 al 	 ready 	 	that	they	would	never	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	what	they	are	 do 	 ing 	 	in	these	other	 count 	 ries 	 	,	here	in	germany	,	or	in	the	u.k.	,	and	so	on	.
cabinet	 mini 	 sters 	 	would	admit	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	in	the	final	session	,	at	the	aspen	institute	,	we	had	them	all	sign	an	open	letter	to	the	kohl	government	,	at	the	time	,	 request 	 ing 	 	that	they	 particip 	 ate 	 	in	the	oecd	convention	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	in	my	opinion	,	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	soft	power	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	 con 	 vince 	 	them	that	they	had	to	go	with	us	.
we	had	a	 long 	 er 	 	-	term	time	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	.
we	had	a	 broad 	 er 	 	,	 geo 	 graphical 	 ly 	 	much	 wide 	 r 	 	,	 constit 	 uency 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	defend	.
and	that	's	why	the	law	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	.
that	's	why	siemens	is	now	in	the	trouble	they	are	in
and	that	's	why	min	is	in	the	trouble	they	are	in	.
in	some	other	 count 	 ries 	 	,	the	oecd	convention	is	not	yet	 proper 	 ly 	 	 enforce 	 d 	 	.
and	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	civil	 socie 	 ties 	 	 breath 	 ing 	 	down	the	neck	of	the	 establish 	 ment 	 	.
in	london	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	where	the	bae	got	away	with	a	huge	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	case	,	which	the	serious	fraud	 off 	 ice 	 	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	 prosecut 	 e 	 	,	100	million	british	 pound 	 s 	 	,	every	year	for	ten	 year 	 s 	 	,	to	one	 part 	 icular 	 	official	of	one	 part 	 icular 	 	friendly	country	,	who	then	 b 	 ought 	 	for	44	billion	 pound 	 s 	 	of	 militar 	 y 	 	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	case	,	they	are	not	 prosecut 	 ing 	 	in	the	uk	.
why	?	 be 	 cause 	 	they	consider	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 contr 	 ary 	 	to	the	security	interest	of	the	people	of	great	britain	.
civil	 socie 	 ty 	 	is	 push 	 ing 	 	,	civil	 socie 	 ty 	 	is	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	a	solution	to	 th 	 is 	 	problem	,	 al 	 so 	 	in	the	u.k.	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	in	japan	,	which	is	not	 proper 	 ly 	 	 en 	 forcing 	 	,	and	so	on	.
in	germany	,	we	are	 push 	 ing 	 	the	 rat 	 ification 	 	of	the	un	convention	,	which	is	a	 sub 	 sequent 	 	convention	.
we	are	,	germany	,	is	not	 rat 	 ifying 	 	.	why	?	 be 	 cause 	 	it	would	make	it	 necess 	 ary 	 	to	 criminal 	 ize 	 	the	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	of	deputies	.
in	germany	,	we	have	a	system	where	you	are	not	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	bribe	a	civil	 serv 	 ant 	 	,	but	you	are	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	bribe	a	 de 	 put 	 y 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	,	under	german	law	,	 allow 	 ed 	 	,
and	the	 member 	 s 	 	of	our	parliament	do	n't	want	to	change	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	why	they	ca	n't	sign	the	u.n.	convention	against	foreign	 bribe 	 ry 	 	--	one	of	they	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	few	 count 	 ries 	 	which	is	 preach 	 ing 	 	 honest 	 y 	 	and	good	 govern 	 ance 	 	 every 	 where 	 	in	the	world	,	but	not	able	to	 rat 	 ify 	 	the	convention	,	which	we	 manage 	 d 	 	to	get	on	the	 book 	 s 	 	with	about	160	 count 	 ries 	 	all	over	the	world	.
i	see	my	time	is	 tick 	 ing 	 	.
let	me	just	try	to	draw	some	 con 	 clusion 	 s 	 	from	what	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	what	we	 manage 	 d 	 	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	in	 fight 	 ing 	 	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	,	one	can	 al 	 so 	 	 achiev 	 e 	 	in	other	 area 	 s 	 	of	 fail 	 ing 	 	 govern 	 ance 	 	.
by	now	,	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	is	 total 	 ly 	 	on	our	side	.
the	world	bank	 ha 	 s 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	from	saulus	to	paulus	;	under	wolfensohn	,	they	 be 	 came 	 	,	i	would	say	,	the	 strong 	 est 	 	anti	-	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	 age 	 ncy 	 	in	the	world	.
most	of	the	large	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	are	now	 total 	 ly 	 	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	that	they	have	to	put	in	place	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	 poli 	 cies 	 	against	 bribe 	 ry 	 	and	so	on	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	possible	 be 	 cause 	 	civil	 socie 	 ty 	 	 join 	 ed 	 	the	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	and	 join 	 ed 	 	the	government	in	the	analysis	of	the	problem	,	in	the	 develop 	 ment 	 	of	 remedi 	 es 	 	,	in	the	 implement 	 ation 	 	of	 reform 	 s 	 	,	and	then	 lat 	 er 	 	,	in	the	 monitor 	 ing 	 	of	 reform 	 s 	 	.
of	course	,	if	civil	 socie 	 ty 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	want	to	play	that	role	,	they	have	to	grow	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 respons 	 ibility 	 	.
not	all	civil	 socie 	 ty 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	are	good	.
the	ku	klux	klan	is	an	ngo	.
so	,	we	must	be	aware	that	civil	 socie 	 ty 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	shape	up	 it 	 self 	 	.
they	have	to	have	a	much	more	 trans 	 parent 	 	financial	 govern 	 ance 	 	.
they	have	to	have	a	much	more	 particip 	 atory 	 	 govern 	 ance 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	civil	 socie 	 ty 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	need	much	more	 compete 	 nce 	 	of	civil	 socie 	 ty 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	why	we	have	set	up	the	 govern 	 ance 	 	school	and	the	center	for	civil	 socie 	 ty 	 	here	in	berlin	,
 be 	 cause 	 	we	 believ 	 e 	 	most	of	our	 education 	 al 	 	and	research	 institution 	 s 	 	in	germany	and	 continent 	 al 	 	europe	in	general	,	do	not	focus	 en 	 ough 	 	,	yet	,	on	 empower 	 ing 	 	civil	 socie 	 ty 	 	and	training	the	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	of	civil	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
but	what	i	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	from	my	 ver 	 y 	 	practical	experience	:	if	civil	 socie 	 ty 	 	 do 	 es 	 	it	right	and	 join 	 s 	 	the	other	 act 	 ors 	 	--	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	 government 	 s 	 	,	 government 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 inter 	 national 	 	 institution 	 s 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	large	 inter 	 national 	 	 act 	 ors 	 	,	in	 part 	 icular 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	which	have	 commit 	 ted 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	corporate	social	 respons 	 ibility 	 	--	then	in	 th 	 is 	 	 magic 	 al 	 	triangle	between	civil	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	government	and	private	sector	,	there	is	a	tremendous	chance	for	all	of	us	to	create	a	better	world	.
thank	you	.
