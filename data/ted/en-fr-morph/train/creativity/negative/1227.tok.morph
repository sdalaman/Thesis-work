erez	lieberman	aiden	:	 every 	 one 	 	 know 	 s 	 	that	a	picture	is	worth	a	thousand	 word 	 s 	 	.
but	we	at	harvard	 we 	 re 	 	 wonder 	 ing 	 	if	 th 	 is 	 	was	 re 	 ally 	 	true	.
so	we	 assemble 	 d 	 	a	team	of	 expert 	 s 	 	,	 span 	 ning 	 	harvard	,	mit	,	the	american	heritage	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	,	the	encyclopedia	britannica	and	even	our	proud	 sponsor 	 s 	 	,	the	google	.
and	we	 cogit 	 ated 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	for	about	four	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	we	came	to	a	 start 	 ling 	 	 con 	 clusion 	 	.
 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	a	picture	is	not	worth	a	thousand	 word 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	we	found	some	 picture 	 s 	 	that	are	worth	500	billion	 word 	 s 	 	.
jean	-	baptiste	michel	:	so	how	did	we	get	to	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 clusion 	 	?
so	erez	and	i	 we 	 re 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	ways	to	get	a	big	picture	of	human	culture	and	human	 histo 	 ry 	 	:	change	over	time	.
so	 man 	 y 	 	 book 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	written	over	the	 year 	 s 	 	.
so	we	 we 	 re 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	,	well	the	best	way	to	learn	from	them	is	to	read	all	of	these	 million 	 s 	 	of	 book 	 s 	 	.
now	of	course	,	if	there	's	a	scale	for	how	awesome	that	is	,	that	 ha 	 s 	 	to	rank	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	,	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	high	.
now	the	problem	is	there	's	an	x	-	axis	for	that	,	which	is	the	practical	axis	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	low	.
now	people	tend	to	use	an	 alter 	 native 	 	approach	,	which	is	to	take	a	few	 source 	 s 	 	and	read	them	 ver 	 y 	 	 care 	 fully 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	practical	,	but	not	so	awesome	.
what	you	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	do	is	to	get	to	the	awesome	yet	practical	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	space	.
so	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	there	was	a	company	 a 	 cross 	 	the	river	 call 	 ed 	 	google	who	had	 start 	 ed 	 	a	 digit 	 ization 	 	project	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	back	that	might	just	 en 	 able 	 	 th 	 is 	 	approach	.
they	have	 digit 	 ized 	 	 million 	 s 	 	of	 book 	 s 	 	.
so	what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	is	,	one	could	use	 computation 	 al 	 	 method 	 s 	 	to	read	all	of	the	 book 	 s 	 	in	a	click	of	a	button	.
that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	practical	and	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	awesome	.
ela	:	let	me	tell	you	a	little	bit	about	where	 book 	 s 	 	come	from	.
since	time	 im 	 memorial 	 	,	there	have	 be 	 en 	 	 author 	 s 	 	.
these	 author 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 striv 	 ing 	 	to	write	 book 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 came 	 	 consider 	 ably 	 	 eas 	 ier 	 	with	the	 develop 	 ment 	 	of	the	 print 	 ing 	 	press	some	centuries	ago	.
since	then	,	the	 author 	 s 	 	have	won	on	129	million	distinct	 occasion 	 s 	 	,	 publish 	 ing 	 	 book 	 s 	 	.
now	if	 t 	 hose 	 	 book 	 s 	 	are	not	lost	to	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	then	they	are	 some 	 where 	 	in	a	library	,	and	 man 	 y 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 book 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 retrieve 	 d 	 	from	the	 lib 	 r 	 aries 	 	and	 digit 	 ized 	 	by	google	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 can 	 ned 	 	15	million	 book 	 s 	 	to	date	.
now	when	google	 digit 	 ize 	 s 	 	a	book	,	they	put	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	nice	format	.
now	we	've	got	the	data	,	plus	we	have	 meta 	 data 	 	.
we	have	information	about	 thing 	 s 	 	like	where	was	it	 publish 	 ed 	 	,	who	was	the	author	,	when	was	it	 publish 	 ed 	 	.
and	what	we	do	is	go	through	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 record 	 s 	 	and	exclude	 every 	 thing 	 	that	's	not	the	highest	quality	data	.
what	we	're	left	with	is	a	 collect 	 ion 	 	of	five	million	 book 	 s 	 	,	500	billion	 word 	 s 	 	,	a	string	of	 character 	 s 	 	a	thousand	 time 	 s 	 	 long 	 er 	 	than	the	human	genome	--	a	text	which	,	when	written	out	,	would	stretch	from	here	to	the	moon	and	back	10	 time 	 s 	 	over	--	a	 ver 	 it 	 able 	 	 s 	 hard 	 	of	our	cultural	genome	.
of	course	what	we	did	when	 face 	 d 	 	with	 s 	 uch 	 	 out 	 rage 	 ous 	 	 hyper 	 bo 	 le 	 	...	was	what	any	self	-	 respect 	 ing 	 	 research 	 ers 	 	would	have	 d 	 one 	 	.
we	took	a	page	out	of	xkcd	,	and	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	stand	back	.
we	're	going	to	try	science	.	``	jm	:	now	of	course	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	,	well	let	's	just	first	put	the	data	out	there	for	people	to	do	science	to	it	.
now	we	're	 think 	 ing 	 	,	what	data	can	we	 re 	 lease 	 	?
well	of	course	,	you	want	to	take	the	 book 	 s 	 	and	 re 	 lease 	 	the	full	text	of	these	five	million	 book 	 s 	 	.
now	google	,	and	jon	orwant	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	told	us	a	little	 equ 	 ation 	 	that	we	should	learn	.
so	you	have	five	million	,	that	is	,	five	million	 author 	 s 	 	and	five	million	 plain 	 tiffs 	 	is	a	massive	 law 	 suit 	 	.
so	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	that	would	be	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	awesome	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	that	's	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	,	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 im 	 practical 	 	.
now	 aga 	 in 	 	,	we	kind	of	 cav 	 ed 	 	in	,	and	we	did	the	 ver 	 y 	 	practical	approach	,	which	was	a	bit	less	awesome	.
we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	well	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 re 	 leas 	 ing 	 	the	full	text	,	we	're	going	to	 re 	 lease 	 	 statistic 	 s 	 	about	the	 book 	 s 	 	.
so	take	for	 in 	 stance 	 	``	a	gleam	of	happiness	.	``
it	's	four	 word 	 s 	 	;	we	call	that	a	four	-	gram	.
we	're	going	to	tell	you	how	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	a	 part 	 icular 	 	four	-	gram	 appear 	 ed 	 	in	 book 	 s 	 	in	1801	,	1802	,	1803	,	that	 give 	 s 	 	us	a	time	 s 	 eries 	 	of	how	 frequent 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	sentence	was	used	over	time	.
we	do	that	for	all	the	 word 	 s 	 	and	 phrase 	 s 	 	that	appear	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 book 	 s 	 	,	and	that	 give 	 s 	 	us	a	big	table	of	two	billion	lines	that	tell	us	about	the	way	culture	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	changing	.
ela	:	so	 t 	 hose 	 	two	billion	lines	,	we	call	them	two	billion	n	-	 gram 	 s 	 	.
what	do	they	tell	us	?
well	the	individual	n	-	 gram 	 s 	 	measure	cultural	 trend 	 s 	 	.
let	me	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
let	's	suppose	that	i	am	 thriv 	 ing 	 	,	then	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	i	want	to	tell	you	about	how	well	i	did	.
and	so	i	might	say	,	``	 yester 	 day 	 	,	i	 thr 	 ove 	 	.	``	alternatively	,	i	could	say	,	``	 yester 	 day 	 	,	i	 thriv 	 ed 	 	.	``	well	which	one	should	i	use	?
how	to	know	?
 a 	 s 	 	of	about	six	 month 	 s 	 	ago	,	the	state	of	the	art	in	 th 	 is 	 	field	is	that	you	would	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	go	up	to	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	 psycho 	 logist 	 	with	fabulous	hair	,	and	you	'd	say	,	``	steve	,	you	're	an	expert	on	the	 ir 	 regular 	 	 verb 	 s 	 	.
what	should	i	do	?	``	and	he	'd	tell	you	,	``	well	most	people	say	 thriv 	 ed 	 	,	but	some	people	say	 thr 	 ove 	 	.	``	and	you	 al 	 so 	 	 k 	 new 	 	,	more	or	less	,	that	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	to	go	back	in	time	200	 year 	 s 	 	and	ask	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	 state 	 s 	 man 	 	with	 equal 	 ly 	 	fabulous	hair	,	``	tom	,	what	should	i	say	?	``	he	'd	say	,	``	well	,	in	my	day	,	most	people	 thr 	 ove 	 	,	but	some	 thriv 	 ed 	 	.	``	so	now	what	i	'm	just	going	to	show	you	is	raw	data	.
two	 row 	 s 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	table	of	two	billion	 ent 	 ries 	 	.
what	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	is	year	by	year	frequency	of	``	 thriv 	 ed 	 	``	and	``	 thr 	 ove 	 	``	over	time	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	two	out	of	two	billion	 row 	 s 	 	.
so	the	entire	data	set	is	a	billion	 time 	 s 	 	more	awesome	than	 th 	 is 	 	slide	.
jm	:	now	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	other	 picture 	 s 	 	that	are	worth	500	billion	 word 	 s 	 	.
for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
if	you	just	take	influenza	,	you	will	see	 peak 	 s 	 	at	the	time	where	you	 k 	 new 	 	big	flu	 epi 	 demic 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 kill 	 ing 	 	people	around	the	 glob 	 e 	 	.

ela	:	you	can	get	at	some	 pre 	 tty 	 	abstract	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	thing	.
for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	let	me	tell	you	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	the	year	1950	.
 pre 	 tty 	 	much	for	the	vast	 major 	 ity 	 	of	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	no	one	 g 	 ave 	 	a	damn	about	1950	.
in	1700	,	in	1800	,	in	1900	,	no	one	 car 	 ed 	 	.
through	the	30s	and	40s	,	no	one	 car 	 ed 	 	.
 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	in	the	mid	-	40s	,	there	 start 	 ed 	 	to	be	a	buzz	.
people	 real 	 ized 	 	that	1950	was	going	to	happen	,	and	it	could	be	big	.
but	 noth 	 ing 	 	got	people	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	1950	like	the	year	1950	.
people	 we 	 re 	 	 walk 	 ing 	 	around	 obsess 	 ed 	 	.
they	could	n't	stop	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	all	the	 thing 	 s 	 	they	did	in	1950	,	all	the	 thing 	 s 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 plan 	 ning 	 	to	do	in	1950	,	all	the	 dream 	 s 	 	of	what	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	accomplish	in	1950	.
in	fact	,	1950	was	so	 fasci 	 nating 	 	that	for	 year 	 s 	 	 there 	 after 	 	,	people	just	 ke 	 pt 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	all	the	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	in	'51	,	'52	,	'53	.
 final 	 ly 	 	in	1954	,	 some 	 one 	 	 wok 	 e 	 	up	and	 real 	 ized 	 	that	1950	had	gotten	 some 	 what 	 	 pass 	 Ã© 	 	.
and	just	like	that	,	the	bubble	burst	.
and	the	story	of	1950	is	the	story	of	every	year	that	we	have	on	record	,	with	a	little	twist	,	 be 	 cause 	 	now	we	've	got	these	nice	 chart 	 s 	 	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	these	nice	 chart 	 s 	 	,	we	can	measure	 thing 	 s 	 	.
we	can	say	,	``	well	how	fast	 do 	 es 	 	the	bubble	burst	?	``	and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	we	can	measure	that	 ver 	 y 	 	 precise 	 ly 	 	.
 equ 	 ations 	 	 we 	 re 	 	derived	,	 graph 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 produce 	 d 	 	,	and	the	net	result	is	that	we	find	that	the	bubble	 burst 	 s 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	and	 fast 	 er 	 	with	each	 pass 	 ing 	 	year	.
we	are	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	interest	in	the	past	more	 rapid 	 ly 	 	.
jm	:	now	a	little	piece	of	 care 	 er 	 	 ad 	 vice 	 	.
so	for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	seek	to	be	famous	,	we	can	learn	from	the	25	most	famous	 politic 	 al 	 	 figure 	 s 	 	,	 author 	 s 	 	,	 act 	 ors 	 	and	so	on	.
so	if	you	want	to	 be 	 come 	 	famous	early	on	,	you	should	be	an	 a 	 ctor 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	then	fame	 start 	 s 	 	 ris 	 ing 	 	by	the	end	of	your	20s	--	you	're	still	young	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	great	.
now	if	you	can	wait	a	little	bit	,	you	should	be	an	author	,	 be 	 cause 	 	then	you	rise	to	 ver 	 y 	 	great	 height 	 s 	 	,	like	mark	 tw 	 ain 	 	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	:	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	famous	.
but	if	you	want	to	reach	the	 ver 	 y 	 	top	,	you	should	delay	 grat 	 ification 	 	and	,	of	course	,	 be 	 come 	 	a	 politic 	 ian 	 	.
so	here	you	will	 be 	 come 	 	famous	by	the	end	of	your	50s	,	and	 be 	 come 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	famous	 after 	 ward 	 	.
so	 scientist 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	tend	to	get	famous	when	they	're	much	 old 	 er 	 	.
like	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	 biologist 	 s 	 	and	physics	tend	to	be	 al 	 most 	 	 a 	 s 	 	famous	 a 	 s 	 	 act 	 ors 	 	.
one	 mistak 	 e 	 	you	should	not	do	is	 be 	 come 	 	a	 mathematic 	 ian 	 	.
if	you	do	that	,	you	might	think	,	``	oh	great	.	i	'm	going	to	do	my	best	work	when	i	'm	in	my	20s	.	``	but	guess	what	,	 no 	 body 	 	will	 re 	 ally 	 	care	.
ela	:	there	are	more	 sober 	 ing 	 	 note 	 s 	 	among	the	n	-	 gram 	 s 	 	.
for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	here	's	the	 tra 	 ject 	 ory 	 	of	marc	chagall	,	an	artist	born	in	1887	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	the	normal	 tra 	 ject 	 ory 	 	of	a	famous	person	.
he	 get 	 s 	 	more	and	more	and	more	famous	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	if	you	look	in	german	.
if	you	look	in	german	,	you	see	 some 	 thing 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	bizarre	,	 some 	 thing 	 	you	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	never	see	,	which	is	he	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	famous	and	then	all	of	a	sudden	 plummet 	 s 	 	,	going	through	a	nadir	between	1933	and	1945	,	before	 re 	 bound 	 ing 	 	 after 	 ward 	 	.
and	of	course	,	what	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	is	the	fact	marc	chagall	was	a	jewish	artist	in	nazi	germany	.
now	these	 signal 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	so	strong	that	we	do	n't	need	to	know	that	 some 	 one 	 	was	 censor 	 ed 	 	.
we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	figure	it	out	using	 re 	 ally 	 	 bas 	 ic 	 	signal	 process 	 ing 	 	.
here	's	a	simple	way	to	do	it	.
well	,	a	 reason 	 able 	 	 expect 	 ation 	 	is	that	 some 	 body 	 	's	fame	in	a	 give 	 n 	 	period	of	time	should	be	 rough 	 ly 	 	the	average	of	 the 	 ir 	 	fame	before	and	 the 	 ir 	 	fame	after	.
so	that	's	sort	of	what	we	expect	.
and	we	 compar 	 e 	 	that	to	the	fame	that	we	 observ 	 e 	 	.
and	we	just	divide	one	by	the	other	to	produce	 some 	 thing 	 	we	call	a	 suppress 	 ion 	 	index	.
if	the	 suppress 	 ion 	 	index	is	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	small	,	then	you	 ver 	 y 	 	well	might	be	 be 	 ing 	 	 suppress 	 ed 	 	.
if	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	large	,	 may 	 be 	 	you	're	 benefit 	 ing 	 	from	 propag 	 and 	 a 	 	.
jm	:	now	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	look	at	the	 distribut 	 ion 	 	of	 suppress 	 ion 	 	 index 	 es 	 	over	whole	 population 	 s 	 	.
so	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	here	--	 th 	 is 	 	 suppress 	 ion 	 	index	is	for	5,000	people	 pick 	 ed 	 	in	english	 book 	 s 	 	where	there	's	no	known	 suppress 	 ion 	 	--	it	would	be	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	 tight 	 ly 	 	 center 	 ed 	 	on	one	.
what	you	expect	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	what	you	 observ 	 e 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 distribut 	 ion 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 s 	 een 	 	in	germany	--	 ver 	 y 	 	different	,	it	's	 shift 	 ed 	 	to	the	left	.
people	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	it	twice	less	 a 	 s 	 	it	should	have	 be 	 en 	 	.
but	much	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	the	 distribut 	 ion 	 	is	much	 wide 	 r 	 	.
there	are	 man 	 y 	 	people	who	end	up	on	the	far	left	on	 th 	 is 	 	 distribut 	 ion 	 	who	are	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	10	 time 	 s 	 	 few 	 er 	 	than	they	should	have	 be 	 en 	 	.
but	then	 al 	 so 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	on	the	far	right	who	seem	to	benefit	from	 propag 	 and 	 a 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	picture	is	the	 hall 	 mark 	 	of	 censor 	 ship 	 	in	the	book	record	.
ela	:	so	 cultur 	 omics 	 	is	what	we	call	 th 	 is 	 	method	.
it	's	kind	of	like	 genomic 	 s 	 	.
 ex 	 cept 	 	 genomic 	 s 	 	is	a	lens	on	biology	through	the	window	of	the	sequence	of	 base 	 s 	 	in	the	human	genome	.
 cultur 	 omics 	 	is	similar	.
it	's	the	application	of	massive	-	scale	data	 collect 	 ion 	 	analysis	to	the	 stud 	 y 	 	of	human	culture	.
here	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	through	the	lens	of	a	genome	,	through	the	lens	of	 digit 	 ized 	 	 piece 	 s 	 	of	the	 historic 	 al 	 	record	.
the	great	thing	about	 cultur 	 omics 	 	is	that	 every 	 one 	 	can	do	it	.
why	can	 every 	 one 	 	do	it	?
 every 	 one 	 	can	do	it	 be 	 cause 	 	three	 guy 	 s 	 	,	jon	orwant	,	matt	gray	and	will	brockman	over	at	google	,	saw	the	prototype	of	the	ngram	 view 	 er 	 	,	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	so	 f 	 un 	 	.
we	have	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	for	people	.	``	so	in	two	 week 	 s 	 	flat	--	the	two	 week 	 s 	 	before	our	paper	came	out	--	they	 cod 	 ed 	 	up	a	version	of	the	ngram	 view 	 er 	 	for	the	general	public	.
and	so	you	too	can	type	in	any	word	or	phrase	that	you	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	and	see	 it 	 s 	 	n	-	gram	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	--	 al 	 so 	 	 brow 	 s 	 e 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	all	the	 vari 	 ous 	 	 book 	 s 	 	in	which	your	n	-	gram	 appear 	 s 	 	.

so	people	want	to	be	 the 	 ir 	 	best	,	put	 the 	 ir 	 	best	foot	forward	.
but	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	in	the	18th	century	,	people	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	care	about	that	at	all	.
they	did	n't	want	to	be	 the 	 ir 	 	best	,	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	 the 	 ir 	 	 be 	 ft 	 	.
so	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	is	,	of	course	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	a	 mistak 	 e 	 	.
it	's	not	that	 s 	 trove 	 	for	 mediocr 	 ity 	 	,
it	's	just	that	the	s	used	to	be	written	 different 	 ly 	 	,	kind	of	like	an	f	.
now	of	course	,	google	did	n't	pick	 th 	 is 	 	up	at	the	time	,	so	we	 report 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	science	article	that	we	wrote	.
but	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	a	 re 	 mind 	 er 	 	that	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	lot	of	 f 	 un 	 	,	when	you	interpret	these	 graph 	 s 	 	,	you	have	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 care 	 ful 	 	,	and	you	have	to	adopt	the	base	 standard 	 s 	 	in	the	 science 	 s 	 	.
ela	:	people	have	 be 	 en 	 	using	 th 	 is 	 	for	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 f 	 un 	 	 purpose 	 s 	 	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	we	're	not	going	to	have	to	talk	,	we	're	just	going	to	show	you	all	the	 slide 	 s 	 	and	remain	silent	.
 th 	 is 	 	person	was	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 frust 	 ration 	 	.
there	's	 vari 	 ous 	 	 type 	 s 	 	of	 frust 	 ration 	 	.
if	you	 s 	 tub 	 	your	 to 	 e 	 	,	that	's	a	one	a	``	argh	.	``
if	the	planet	earth	is	 annihil 	 ated 	 	by	the	vogons	to	make	room	for	an	 inter 	 stellar 	 	bypass	,	that	's	an	eight	a	``	 aaaaaaa 	 argh 	 	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	person	 stud 	 ies 	 	all	the	``	 argh 	 s 	 	,	``	from	one	through	eight	a	's	.
and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	the	less	-	frequent	``	 argh 	 s 	 	``	are	,	of	course	,	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	correspond	to	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	more	 frust 	 rating 	 	--	 ex 	 cept 	 	,	 odd 	 ly 	 	,	in	the	early	80s	.
we	think	that	might	have	 some 	 thing 	 	to	do	with	reagan	.	jm	:	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 us 	 age 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	data	,	but	the	bottom	line	is	that	the	 historic 	 al 	 	record	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 digit 	 ized 	 	.
google	 ha 	 s 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	to	 digit 	 ize 	 	15	million	 book 	 s 	 	.
that	's	12	percent	of	all	the	 book 	 s 	 	that	have	ever	 be 	 en 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	.
it	's	a	 s 	 izable 	 	chunk	of	human	culture	.
there	's	much	more	in	culture	:	there	's	 man 	 u 	 script 	 s 	 	,	there	 news 	 paper 	 s 	 	,	there	's	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	not	text	,	like	art	and	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
these	all	happen	to	be	on	our	 computer 	 s 	 	,	on	 computer 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	world	.
and	when	that	 happen 	 s 	 	,	that	will	transform	the	way	we	have	to	understand	our	past	,	our	present	and	human	culture	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
