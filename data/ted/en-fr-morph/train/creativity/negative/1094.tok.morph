when	i	got	my	current	job	,	i	was	 give 	 n 	 	a	good	piece	of	 ad 	 vice 	 	,	which	was	to	interview	three	 politic 	 ians 	 	every	day	.
and	from	that	much	contact	with	 politic 	 ians 	 	,	i	can	tell	you	they	're	all	 emotion 	 al 	 	 freak 	 s 	 	of	one	sort	or	 an 	 other 	 	.
they	have	what	i	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 logo 	 rrhea 	 	 de 	 ment 	 ia 	 	,	``	which	is	they	talk	so	much	they	drive	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 insan 	 e 	 	.
but	what	they	do	have	is	 in 	 credible 	 	social	 skill 	 s 	 	.
when	you	meet	them	,	they	lock	 in 	 to 	 	you	,	they	look	you	in	the	eye	,	they	 invad 	 e 	 	your	personal	space	,	they	 mass 	 age 	 	the	back	of	your	head	.
i	had	 d 	 inner 	 	with	a	republican	senator	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 month 	 s 	 	ago	who	 ke 	 pt 	 	his	hand	on	my	inner	 t 	 high 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	whole	meal	--	 squeez 	 ing 	 	it	.
i	once	--	 th 	 is 	 	was	 year 	 s 	 	ago	--	i	saw	ted	kennedy	and	dan	quayle	meet	in	the	well	of	the	senate	.
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 hugg 	 ed 	 	each	other	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 laugh 	 ing 	 	,	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 face 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	far	 a 	 part 	 	.
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	moving	and	 grind 	 ing 	 	and	moving	 the 	 ir 	 	 arm 	 s 	 	up	and	down	each	other	.
and	i	was	like	,	``	get	a	room	.	i	do	n't	want	to	see	 th 	 is 	 	.	``
but	they	have	 t 	 hose 	 	social	 skill 	 s 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	case	:	last	election	cycle	,	i	was	 follow 	 ing 	 	mitt	romney	around	new	hampshire	,
and	he	was	 campaign 	 ing 	 	with	his	five	perfect	 son 	 s 	 	:	bip	,	chip	,	rip	,	zip	,	lip	and	dip	.
and	he	's	going	 in 	 to 	 	a	 din 	 er 	 	.
and	he	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 din 	 er 	 	,	 introduc 	 es 	 	 him 	 self 	 	to	a	family	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	what	village	are	you	from	in	new	hampshire	?	``
and	then	he	 de 	 scribe 	 s 	 	the	home	he	owned	in	 the 	 ir 	 	village	.
and	so	he	 go 	 es 	 	around	the	room	,	and	then	 a 	 s 	 	he	's	 leav 	 ing 	 	the	 din 	 er 	 	,	he	first	-	 name 	 s 	 	 al 	 most 	 	 every 	 body 	 	he	's	just	met	.
i	was	like	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	that	's	social	skill	.	``
but	the	paradox	is	,	when	a	lot	of	these	people	slip	 in 	 to 	 	the	policy	-	making	mode	,	that	social	 aware 	 ness 	 	 vanish 	 es 	 	and	they	start	 talk 	 ing 	 	like	 account 	 ants 	 	.
so	in	the	course	of	my	 care 	 er 	 	,	i	have	 cover 	 ed 	 	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 failure 	 s 	 	.
we	 s 	 ent 	 	 economist 	 s 	 	in	the	soviet	 un 	 ion 	 	with	 privat 	 ization 	 	 plan 	 s 	 	when	it	broke	up	,	and	what	they	 re 	 ally 	 	 lack 	 ed 	 	was	social	trust	.
we	 invad 	 ed 	 	 ir 	 aq 	 	with	a	 militar 	 y 	 	 obliv 	 ious 	 	to	the	cultural	and	 psycho 	 logical 	 	 real 	 ities 	 	.
we	had	a	financial	 regulat 	 ory 	 	regime	based	on	the	 assumption 	 s 	 	that	 trade 	 rs 	 	 we 	 re 	 	rational	 creature 	 s 	 	who	would	n't	do	 any 	 thing 	 	stupid	.
for	30	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 cover 	 ing 	 	school	reform	and	we	've	 bas 	 ically 	 	 re 	 organize 	 d 	 	the	 bureaucrat 	 ic 	 	boxes	--	 chart 	 ers 	 	,	private	 school 	 s 	 	,	 voucher 	 s 	 	--	but	we	've	had	 disappoint 	 ing 	 	 result 	 s 	 	year	after	year	.
and	the	fact	is	,	people	learn	from	people	they	love	.
and	if	you	're	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	individual	relationship	between	a	teacher	and	a	student	,	you	're	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	that	 re 	 ality 	 	.	but	that	 re 	 ality 	 	is	 exp 	 ung 	 ed 	 	from	our	policy	-	making	process	.
and	so	that	's	led	to	a	question	for	me	:	why	are	the	most	 social 	 ly 	 	-	 at 	 tuned 	 	people	on	earth	 complete 	 ly 	 	 de 	 human 	 ized 	 	when	they	think	about	policy	?
and	i	came	to	the	 con 	 clusion 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	symptom	of	a	 large 	 r 	 	problem	.
that	,	for	centuries	,	we	've	 inherit 	 ed 	 	a	view	of	human	nature	based	on	the	 not 	 ion 	 	that	we	're	 divid 	 ed 	 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	that	reason	is	 separat 	 ed 	 	from	the	 emotion 	 s 	 	and	that	 socie 	 ty 	 	 progress 	 es 	 	to	the	 ex 	 tent 	 	that	reason	can	suppress	the	 pass 	 ions 	 	.
and	it	's	led	to	a	view	of	human	nature	that	we	're	rational	 individual 	 s 	 	who	respond	in	 straight 	 forward 	 	ways	to	 incentive 	 s 	 	,
and	it	's	led	to	ways	of	 see 	 ing 	 	the	world	where	people	try	to	use	the	 assumption 	 s 	 	of	physics	to	measure	how	human	behavior	is	.
and	it	's	 produce 	 d 	 	a	great	 amput 	 ation 	 	,	a	 sh 	 allow 	 	view	of	human	nature	.
we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	good	at	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	material	 thing 	 s 	 	,	but	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	at	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 emotion 	 s 	 	.
we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	good	at	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 skill 	 s 	 	and	 safe 	 ty 	 	and	health	;	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	at	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	character	.
alasdair	macintyre	,	the	famous	 philosoph 	 er 	 	,	 s 	 aid 	 	that	,	``	we	have	the	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	of	the	ancient	 moral 	 ity 	 	of	virtue	,	honor	,	 good 	 ness 	 	,	but	we	no	 long 	 er 	 	have	a	system	by	which	to	connect	them	.	``
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	led	to	a	 sh 	 allow 	 	path	in	 politic 	 s 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	in	a	whole	range	of	human	 endeavor 	 s 	 	.
you	can	see	it	in	the	way	we	raise	our	young	 kid 	 s 	 	.
you	go	to	an	 element 	 ary 	 	school	at	three	in	the	afternoon	and	you	watch	the	 kid 	 s 	 	come	out	,	and	they	're	 wear 	 ing 	 	these	80	-	pound	 back 	 pack 	 s 	 	.
if	the	wind	 blow 	 s 	 	them	over	,	they	're	like	 beetle 	 s 	 	 s 	 tuck 	 	there	on	the	ground	.
you	see	these	 car 	 s 	 	that	drive	up	--	 usual 	 ly 	 	it	's	saabs	and	audis	and	volvos	,	 be 	 cause 	 	in	certain	 neighbor 	 hood 	 s 	 	it	's	 social 	 ly 	 	 accept 	 able 	 	to	have	a	 luxur 	 y 	 	car	,	so	long	 a 	 s 	 	it	 come 	 s 	 	from	a	country	 hostil 	 e 	 	to	u.s.	foreign	policy	--	that	's	fine	.
they	get	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	by	these	 creature 	 s 	 	i	've	 call 	 ed 	 	uber	-	 mom 	 s 	 	,	who	are	 high 	 ly 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	 care 	 er 	 	women	who	have	taken	time	off	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	all	 the 	 ir 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	get	 in 	 to 	 	harvard	.
and	you	can	 usual 	 ly 	 	tell	the	uber	-	 mom 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	weigh	less	than	 the 	 ir 	 	own	children	.
so	at	the	moment	of	conception	,	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	little	butt	 exercis 	 es 	 	.	 bab 	 ies 	 	flop	out	,	they	're	 flash 	 ing 	 	mandarin	 flash 	 card 	 s 	 	at	the	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 driv 	 ing 	 	them	home	,	and	they	want	them	to	be	 enlighten 	 ed 	 	,	so	they	take	them	to	ben	&	jerry	's	ice	cream	company	with	 it 	 s 	 	own	foreign	policy	.
in	one	of	my	 book 	 s 	 	,	i	joke	that	ben	&	jerry	's	should	make	a	pacifist	 tooth 	 paste 	 	--	 do 	 es 	 	n't	kill	 germ 	 s 	 	,	just	 ask 	 s 	 	them	to	 leav 	 e 	 	.
it	would	be	a	big	seller	.
and	they	go	to	whole	 food 	 s 	 	to	get	 the 	 ir 	 	baby	formula	,
and	whole	 food 	 s 	 	is	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 progress 	 ive 	 	 grocer 	 y 	 	 store 	 s 	 	where	all	the	 cash 	 ier 	 s 	 	look	like	they	're	on	loan	from	amnesty	 inter 	 national 	 	.
they	buy	these	 sea 	 weed 	 	-	based	 snack 	 s 	 	there	 call 	 ed 	 	veggie	booty	with	kale	,	which	is	for	 kid 	 s 	 	who	come	home	and	say	,	``	mom	,	mom	,	i	want	a	snack	that	'll	help	prevent	colon	-	 rect 	 al 	 	cancer	.	``
and	so	the	 kid 	 s 	 	are	raised	in	a	certain	way	,	 jump 	 ing 	 	through	 achiev 	 ement 	 	 hoop 	 s 	 	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	can	measure	--	 s 	 at 	 	prep	,	 obo 	 e 	 	,	soccer	practice	.
they	get	 in 	 to 	 	competitive	 college 	 s 	 	,	they	get	good	 job 	 s 	 	,	and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	they	make	a	success	of	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	a	 super 	 ficial 	 	manner	,	and	they	make	a	ton	of	money	.
and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	you	can	see	them	at	 vac 	 ation 	 	 place 	 s 	 	like	jackson	hole	or	aspen	.
and	they	've	 be 	 come 	 	elegant	and	 s 	 lender 	 	--	they	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	have	 t 	 high 	 s 	 	;	they	just	have	one	elegant	calve	on	top	of	 an 	 other 	 	.
they	have	 kid 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	,	and	they	've	 achiev 	 ed 	 	a	genetic	miracle	by	 marry 	 ing 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	people	,	so	 the 	 ir 	 	 grand 	 mom 	 s 	 	look	like	gertrude	stein	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 daughter 	 s 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	halle	berry	--	i	do	n't	know	how	they	've	 d 	 one 	 	that	.	they	get	there	and	they	 real 	 ize 	 	it	's	 fashion 	 able 	 	now	to	have	 dog 	 s 	 	a	third	 a 	 s 	 	tall	 a 	 s 	 	your	 ceil 	 ing 	 	 height 	 s 	 	.
so	they	've	got	these	 fur 	 ry 	 	160	-	pound	 dog 	 s 	 	--	all	look	like	 velo 	 ciraptor 	 s 	 	,	all	named	after	jane	austen	 character 	 s 	 	.
and	then	when	they	get	old	,	they	have	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	 philosoph 	 y 	 	of	life	,	but	they	've	 decide 	 d 	 	,	``	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	at	 every 	 thing 	 	;	i	'm	just	not	going	to	die	.	``
and	so	they	hire	personal	 train 	 ers 	 	;	they	're	 pop 	 ping 	 	cialis	like	breath	 mint 	 s 	 	.
you	see	them	on	the	 mountain 	 s 	 	up	there	.
they	're	cross	-	country	 ski 	 ing 	 	up	the	mountain	with	these	grim	 express 	 ions 	 	that	make	 d 	 ick 	 	cheney	look	like	jerry	lewis	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	they	whiz	by	you	,	it	's	like	 be 	 ing 	 	 pass 	 ed 	 	by	a	little	iron	raisinet	going	up	the	hill	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	part	of	what	life	is	,	but	it	's	not	all	of	what	life	is	.
and	over	the	past	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	think	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 give 	 n 	 	a	 deep 	 er 	 	view	of	human	nature	and	a	 deep 	 er 	 	view	of	who	we	are	.
and	it	's	not	based	on	 the 	 ology 	 	or	 philosoph 	 y 	 	,	it	's	in	the	 stud 	 y 	 	of	the	mind	,	 a 	 cross 	 	all	these	 sphere 	 s 	 	of	research	,	from	 neuro 	 science 	 	to	the	cognitive	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	 behavior 	 al 	 	 economist 	 s 	 	,	 psycho 	 logists 	 	,	 socio 	 logy 	 	,	we	're	 develop 	 ing 	 	a	revolution	in	 conscious 	 ness 	 	.
and	when	you	synthesize	it	all	,	it	's	giving	us	a	new	view	of	human	nature	.
and	far	from	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 cold 	 ly 	 	 material 	 istic 	 	view	of	nature	,	it	's	a	new	 human 	 ism 	 	,	it	's	a	new	 enchant 	 ment 	 	.
and	i	think	when	you	synthesize	 th 	 is 	 	research	,	you	start	with	three	key	 in 	 sight 	 s 	 	.
the	first	 in 	 sight 	 	is	that	while	the	conscious	mind	 write 	 s 	 	the	 auto 	 bio 	 graphy 	 	of	our	species	,	the	 un 	 conscious 	 	mind	 do 	 es 	 	most	of	the	work	.
and	so	one	way	to	 form 	 ulate 	 	that	is	the	human	mind	can	take	in	 million 	 s 	 	of	 piece 	 s 	 	of	information	a	minute	,	of	which	it	can	be	 conscious 	 ly 	 	aware	of	about	40	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 lead 	 s 	 	to	 odd 	 ities 	 	.
one	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	is	that	people	named	dennis	are	 dis 	 proportion 	 ate 	 ly 	 	 like 	 ly 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	 dent 	 ists 	 	,	people	named	lawrence	 be 	 come 	 	 lawyer 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 un 	 conscious 	 ly 	 	we	 gravit 	 ate 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	sound	familiar	,	which	is	why	i	named	my	daughter	 p 	 resident 	 	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	brooks	.
 an 	 other 	 	 find 	 ing 	 	is	that	the	 un 	 conscious 	 	,	far	from	 be 	 ing 	 	dumb	and	 sexual 	 ized 	 	,	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	smart	.
so	one	of	the	most	 cognitive 	 ly 	 	 demand 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	we	do	is	buy	furniture	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	to	imagine	a	 s 	 of 	 a 	 	,	how	it	's	going	to	look	in	your	house	.
and	the	way	you	should	do	that	is	 stud 	 y 	 	the	furniture	,	let	it	 marin 	 ate 	 	in	your	mind	,	distract	 your 	 self 	 	,	and	then	a	few	 day 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	go	with	your	gut	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 un 	 conscious 	 ly 	 	you	've	 figur 	 ed 	 	it	out	.
the	second	 in 	 sight 	 	is	that	 emotion 	 s 	 	are	at	the	center	of	our	 think 	 ing 	 	.
people	with	 stroke 	 s 	 	and	 les 	 ions 	 	in	the	emotion	-	 process 	 ing 	 	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	brain	are	not	super	smart	,	they	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 help 	 less 	 	.
and	the	``	giant	``	in	the	field	is	in	the	room	 to 	 night 	 	and	is	 s 	 peaking 	 	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	--	antonio	damasio	.
and	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	he	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 show 	 n 	 	us	is	that	 emotion 	 s 	 	are	not	 separat 	 e 	 	from	reason	,	but	they	are	the	 found 	 ation 	 	of	reason	 be 	 cause 	 	they	tell	us	what	to	value	.
and	so	 read 	 ing 	 	and	 educ 	 ating 	 	your	 emotion 	 s 	 	is	one	of	the	central	 activ 	 ities 	 	of	 wis 	 dom 	 	.
now	i	'm	a	middle	-	aged	guy	.	i	'm	not	 exact 	 ly 	 	 comfort 	 able 	 	with	 emotion 	 s 	 	.
one	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	brain	 st 	 ories 	 	 de 	 scribed 	 	these	middle	-	aged	 guy 	 s 	 	.
they	put	them	 in 	 to 	 	a	brain	 s 	 can 	 	machine	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	 a 	 po 	 cry 	 phal 	 	by	the	way	,	but	i	do	n't	care	--	and	they	had	them	watch	a	 horr 	 or 	 	movie	,	and	then	they	had	them	 de 	 scribe 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	wives	.
and	the	brain	 s 	 can 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 ident 	 ical 	 	in	both	 activ 	 ities 	 	.
it	was	just	 she 	 er 	 	terror	.
so	me	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	emotion	is	like	gandhi	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 glut 	 ton 	 y 	 	,	but	it	is	the	central	 organ 	 izing 	 	process	of	the	way	we	think	.
it	 tell 	 s 	 	us	what	to	 im 	 print 	 	.
the	brain	is	the	record	of	the	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	a	life	.
and	the	third	 in 	 sight 	 	is	that	we	're	not	 prim 	 arily 	 	self	-	 contain 	 ed 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	.
we	're	social	 animal 	 s 	 	,	not	rational	 animal 	 s 	 	.
we	emerge	out	of	 relationship 	 s 	 	,	and	we	are	 deep 	 ly 	 	 inter 	 penetrate 	 d 	 	,	one	with	 an 	 other 	 	.
and	so	when	we	see	 an 	 other 	 	person	,	we	 re 	 enact 	 	in	our	own	 mind 	 s 	 	what	we	see	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 mind 	 s 	 	.
when	we	watch	a	car	chase	in	a	movie	,	it	's	 al 	 most 	 	 a 	 s 	 	if	we	are	 sub 	 t 	 ly 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	car	chase	.
when	we	watch	 porn 	 ography 	 	,	it	's	a	little	like	 hav 	 ing 	 	 s 	 ex 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	 prob 	 ably 	 	not	 a 	 s 	 	good	.
and	we	see	 th 	 is 	 	when	 lover 	 s 	 	walk	down	the	street	,	when	a	crowd	in	egypt	or	tunisia	 get 	 s 	 	caught	up	in	an	 emotion 	 al 	 	 con 	 tag 	 ion 	 	,	the	deep	 inter 	 penet 	 ration 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	revolution	in	who	we	are	 give 	 s 	 	us	a	different	way	of	 see 	 ing 	 	,	i	think	,	 politic 	 s 	 	,	a	different	way	,	most	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	of	 see 	 ing 	 	human	capital	.
we	are	now	children	of	the	french	 enlighten 	 ment 	 	.
we	 believ 	 e 	 	that	reason	is	the	highest	of	the	 facul 	 ties 	 	.
but	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	research	 show 	 s 	 	that	the	british	 enlighten 	 ment 	 	,	or	the	scottish	 enlighten 	 ment 	 	,	with	david	hume	,	adam	smith	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	a	better	handle	on	who	we	are	--	that	reason	is	often	weak	,	our	 sentiment 	 s 	 	are	strong	,	and	our	 sentiment 	 s 	 	are	often	 trust 	 worthy 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	work	 correct 	 s 	 	that	bias	in	our	culture	,	that	 de 	 human 	 izing 	 	bias	.
it	 give 	 s 	 	us	a	 deep 	 er 	 	sense	of	what	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 take 	 s 	 	for	us	to	 thriv 	 e 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	life	.
when	we	think	about	human	capital	we	think	about	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	can	measure	 eas 	 ily 	 	--	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 grade 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 at 	 	's	,	 degree 	 s 	 	,	the	number	of	 year 	 s 	 	in	 school 	 ing 	 	.
what	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 take 	 s 	 	to	do	well	,	to	lead	a	 meaning 	 ful 	 	life	,	are	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 deep 	 er 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	even	have	 word 	 s 	 	for	.
and	so	let	me	list	just	a	couple	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	research	 point 	 s 	 	us	 to 	 ward 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	.
the	first	gift	,	or	talent	,	is	 mind 	 sight 	 	--	the	ability	to	enter	 in 	 to 	 	other	people	's	 mind 	 s 	 	and	learn	what	they	have	to	 off 	 er 	 	.
 bab 	 ies 	 	come	with	 th 	 is 	 	ability	.
meltzoff	,	who	's	at	the	university	of	washington	,	 lean 	 ed 	 	over	a	baby	who	was	43	 minute 	 s 	 	old	.
he	 wagg 	 ed 	 	his	tongue	at	the	baby	.
the	baby	 wagg 	 ed 	 	her	tongue	back	.
 bab 	 ies 	 	are	born	to	 inter 	 penetrate 	 	 in 	 to 	 	mom	's	mind	and	to	download	what	they	find	--	 the 	 ir 	 	 model 	 s 	 	of	how	to	understand	 re 	 ality 	 	.
in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	55	percent	of	 bab 	 ies 	 	have	a	deep	two	-	way	conversation	with	mom	and	they	learn	 model 	 s 	 	to	how	to	 re 	 late 	 	to	other	people	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	people	who	have	 model 	 s 	 	of	how	to	 re 	 late 	 	have	a	huge	head	start	in	life	.
 scientist 	 s 	 	at	the	university	of	minnesota	did	a	 stud 	 y 	 	in	which	they	could	predict	with	77	percent	 accu 	 racy 	 	,	at	age	18	 month 	 s 	 	,	who	was	going	to	graduate	from	high	school	,	based	on	who	had	good	 attach 	 ment 	 	with	mom	.
twenty	percent	of	 kid 	 s 	 	do	not	have	 t 	 hose 	 	 relationship 	 s 	 	.
they	are	what	we	call	 avoid 	 ant 	 ly 	 	 attach 	 ed 	 	.
they	have	trouble	 relat 	 ing 	 	to	other	people	.
they	go	through	life	like	 sail 	 boat 	 s 	 	 tack 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	wind	--	 want 	 ing 	 	to	get	close	to	people	,	but	not	 re 	 ally 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	 model 	 s 	 	of	how	to	do	that	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	skill	of	how	to	 ho 	 over 	 	up	knowledge	,	one	from	 an 	 other 	 	.
a	second	skill	is	equal	poise	,
the	ability	to	have	the	 s 	 er 	 en 	 ity 	 	to	read	the	 bias 	 es 	 	and	 failure 	 s 	 	in	your	own	mind	.
so	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	we	are	 over 	 confidence 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	.
ninety	-	five	percent	of	our	 professor 	 s 	 	report	that	they	are	above	-	average	 teacher 	 s 	 	.
ninety	-	six	percent	of	college	 student 	 s 	 	say	they	have	above	-	average	social	 skill 	 s 	 	.
time	magazine	 ask 	 ed 	 	americans	,	``	are	you	in	the	top	one	percent	of	 earn 	 ers 	 	?	``
 nine 	 teen 	 	percent	of	americans	are	in	the	top	one	percent	of	 earn 	 ers 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	gender	-	linked	trait	,	by	the	way	.
men	drown	at	twice	the	rate	of	women	,
 be 	 cause 	 	men	think	they	can	swim	 a 	 cross 	 	that	lake	.
but	some	people	have	the	ability	and	 aware 	 ness 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 bias 	 es 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 over 	 confidence 	 	.
they	have	 epistemo 	 logical 	 	 modest 	 y 	 	.
they	are	open	-	minded	in	the	face	of	 ambigu 	 ity 	 	.
they	are	able	to	adjust	strength	of	the	 con 	 clusion 	 s 	 	to	the	strength	of	 the 	 ir 	 	evidence	.
they	are	 cur 	 ious 	 	.
and	these	 trait 	 s 	 	are	often	 un 	 related 	 	and	 un 	 correlate 	 d 	 	with	iq	.
the	third	trait	is	 met 	 is 	 	,	what	we	might	call	street	 smart 	 s 	 	--	it	's	a	greek	word	.
it	's	a	 sensitiv 	 ity 	 	to	the	physical	environment	,	the	ability	to	pick	out	 pattern 	 s 	 	in	an	environment	--	 der 	 ive 	 	a	 g 	 ist 	 	.
one	of	my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	at	the	 time 	 s 	 	did	a	great	story	about	 soldier 	 s 	 	in	 ir 	 aq 	 	who	could	look	down	a	street	and	detect	 some 	 how 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	there	was	an	ied	,	a	 land 	 mine 	 	,	in	the	street	.
they	could	n't	tell	you	how	they	did	it	,	but	they	could	feel	cold	,	they	felt	a	 cold 	 ness 	 	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	more	often	right	than	wrong	.
the	third	is	what	you	might	call	 sympath 	 y 	 	,	the	ability	to	work	 with 	 in 	 	 group 	 s 	 	.
and	that	 come 	 s 	 	in	 tremendous 	 ly 	 	 hand 	 y 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 group 	 s 	 	are	 smart 	 er 	 	than	 individual 	 s 	 	.	and	face	-	to	-	face	 group 	 s 	 	are	much	 smart 	 er 	 	than	 group 	 s 	 	that	communicate	 electron 	 ically 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	90	percent	of	our	communication	is	non	-	verbal	.
and	the	 effective 	 ness 	 	of	a	group	is	not	 determine 	 d 	 	by	the	iq	of	the	group	;	it	's	 determine 	 d 	 	by	how	well	they	communicate	,	how	often	they	take	 turn 	 s 	 	in	conversation	.
then	you	could	talk	about	a	trait	like	 blend 	 ing 	 	.
any	child	can	say	,	``	i	'm	a	tiger	,	``	pretend	to	be	a	tiger	.
it	 seem 	 s 	 	so	 element 	 ary 	 	.
but	in	fact	,	it	's	 phenomen 	 ally 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	to	take	a	 con 	 cept 	 	``	i	``	and	a	 con 	 cept 	 	``	tiger	``	and	blend	them	together	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	source	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
what	picasso	did	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	was	take	the	 con 	 cept 	 	``	western	art	``	and	the	 con 	 cept 	 	``	african	 mask 	 s 	 	``	and	blend	them	together	--	not	 on 	 ly 	 	the	 geo 	 metry 	 	,	but	the	moral	 system 	 s 	 	 ent 	 ailed 	 	in	them	.
and	these	are	 skill 	 s 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	we	ca	n't	count	and	measure	.
and	then	the	final	thing	i	'll	 ment 	 ion 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	you	might	call	 lime 	 rence 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	an	ability	;	it	's	a	drive	and	a	 motiv 	 ation 	 	.	the	conscious	mind	 hung 	 ers 	 	for	success	and	 pre 	 stig 	 e 	 	.
the	 un 	 conscious 	 	mind	 hung 	 ers 	 	for	 t 	 hose 	 	 moment 	 s 	 	of	 transcend 	 ence 	 	,	when	the	skull	line	 disappear 	 s 	 	and	we	are	lost	in	a	 challeng 	 e 	 	or	a	task	--	when	a	 craft 	 s 	 man 	 	 feel 	 s 	 	lost	in	his	craft	,	when	a	 natural 	 ist 	 	 feel 	 s 	 	at	one	with	nature	,	when	a	 believ 	 er 	 	 feel 	 s 	 	at	one	with	god	's	love	.
that	is	what	the	 un 	 conscious 	 	mind	 hung 	 ers 	 	for	.
and	 man 	 y 	 	of	us	feel	it	in	love	when	 lover 	 s 	 	feel	fused	.
and	one	of	the	most	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 de 	 script 	 ions 	 	i	've	come	 a 	 cross 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	research	of	how	 mind 	 s 	 	 inter 	 penetrate 	 	was	written	by	a	great	 theor 	 ist 	 	and	scientist	named	douglas	hofstadter	at	the	university	of	indiana	.
he	was	married	to	a	woman	named	carol	,	and	they	had	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	relationship	.
when	 the 	 ir 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	five	and	two	,	carol	had	a	stroke	and	a	brain	tumor	and	 di 	 ed 	 	 sudden 	 ly 	 	.
and	hofstadter	wrote	a	book	 call 	 ed 	 	``	i	am	a	strange	loop	.	``
in	the	course	of	that	book	,	he	 de 	 scribe 	 s 	 	a	moment	--	just	 month 	 s 	 	after	carol	 ha 	 s 	 	 di 	 ed 	 	--	he	 come 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	her	picture	on	the	 man 	 tel 	 	,	or	on	a	bureau	in	his	 bed 	 room 	 	.
and	here	's	what	he	wrote	:	``	i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	her	face	,	and	i	 look 	 ed 	 	so	 deep 	 ly 	 	that	i	felt	i	was	 be 	 hind 	 	her	 eye 	 s 	 	.
and	all	at	once	i	found	 my 	 self 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 tear 	 s 	 	 flow 	 ed 	 	,	'	that	's	me	.	that	's	me	.	'
and	 t 	 hose 	 	simple	 word 	 s 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	back	 man 	 y 	 	 thought 	 s 	 	that	i	had	had	before	,	about	the	fusion	of	our	 soul 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	one	 high 	 er 	 	-	level	 ent 	 ity 	 	,	about	the	fact	that	at	the	core	of	both	our	 soul 	 s 	 	lay	our	 ident 	 ical 	 	 hope 	 s 	 	and	 dream 	 s 	 	for	our	children	,	about	the	 not 	 ion 	 	that	 t 	 hose 	 	 hope 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	not	 separat 	 e 	 	or	distinct	 hope 	 s 	 	,	but	 we 	 re 	 	just	one	hope	,	one	clear	thing	that	defined	us	both	,	that	welded	us	 in 	 to 	 	a	unit	--	the	kind	of	unit	i	had	but	 d 	 im 	 ly 	 	 imagin 	 ed 	 	before	 be 	 ing 	 	married	and	 hav 	 ing 	 	children	.
i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	,	 th 	 ough 	 	carol	had	 di 	 ed 	 	,	that	core	piece	of	her	had	not	 di 	 ed 	 	at	all	,	but	had	lived	on	 ver 	 y 	 	 determine 	 d 	 ly 	 	in	my	brain	.	``
the	greeks	say	we	suffer	our	way	to	 wis 	 dom 	 	.
through	his	 suffer 	 ing 	 	,	hofstadter	 under 	 stood 	 	how	 deep 	 ly 	 	 inter 	 penetrate 	 d 	 	we	are	.
through	the	policy	 failure 	 s 	 	of	the	last	30	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	have	come	to	 acknowledg 	 e 	 	,	i	think	,	how	 sh 	 allow 	 	our	view	of	human	nature	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	.
and	now	 a 	 s 	 	we	confront	that	 sh 	 allow 	 ness 	 	and	the	 failure 	 s 	 	that	 der 	 ive 	 	from	our	 in 	 ability 	 	to	get	the	 depth 	 s 	 	of	who	we	are	,	 come 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	revolution	in	 conscious 	 ness 	 	--	these	people	in	so	 man 	 y 	 	 field 	 s 	 	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	the	depth	of	our	nature	and	coming	away	with	 th 	 is 	 	 enchant 	 ed 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	new	 human 	 ism 	 	.
and	when	freud	 discover 	 ed 	 	his	sense	of	the	 un 	 conscious 	 	,	it	had	a	vast	effect	on	the	climate	of	the	 time 	 s 	 	.
now	we	are	 discover 	 ing 	 	a	more	accurate	vision	of	the	 un 	 conscious 	 	,	of	who	we	are	deep	 in 	 side 	 	,
and	it	's	going	to	have	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	and	 pro 	 found 	 	and	 human 	 izing 	 	effect	on	our	culture	.
thank	you	.
