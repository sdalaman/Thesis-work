thank	you	.	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	an	honor	and	a	privilege	to	be	here	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	my	last	day	 a 	 s 	 	a	teenager	.
 to 	 day 	 	i	want	to	talk	to	you	about	the	future	,	but	first	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	a	bit	about	the	past	.
my	story	 start 	 s 	 	way	before	i	was	born	.
my	 grand 	 mother 	 	was	on	a	train	to	auschwitz	,	the	death	camp	.
and	she	was	going	 a 	 long 	 	the	 track 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 track 	 s 	 	split	.
and	 some 	 how 	 	--	we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	know	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	whole	story	--	but	the	train	took	the	wrong	track	and	went	to	a	work	camp	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	the	death	camp	.
my	 grand 	 mother 	 	 surviv 	 ed 	 	and	married	my	 grand 	 father 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	living	in	hungary	,	and	my	mother	was	born	.
and	when	my	mother	was	two	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	the	hungarian	revolution	was	 rag 	 ing 	 	,	and	they	 decide 	 d 	 	to	 es 	 cape 	 	hungary	.
they	got	on	a	boat	,	and	yet	 an 	 other 	 	 diverge 	 nce 	 	--	the	boat	was	either	going	to	canada	or	to	australia	.
they	got	on	and	did	n't	know	where	they	 we 	 re 	 	going	,	and	 end 	 ed 	 	up	in	canada	.
so	,	to	make	a	long	story	short	,	they	came	to	canada	.
my	 grand 	 mother 	 	was	a	chemist	.	she	 work 	 ed 	 	at	the	banting	institute	in	toronto	,	and	at	44	she	 di 	 ed 	 	of	stomach	cancer	.	i	never	met	my	 grand 	 mother 	 	,	but	i	carry	on	her	name	--	her	exact	name	,	eva	vertes	--	and	i	like	to	think	i	carry	on	her	scientific	 pass 	 ion 	 	,	too	.
i	found	 th 	 is 	 	 pass 	 ion 	 	not	far	from	here	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	when	i	was	nine	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
my	family	was	on	a	road	trip	and	we	 we 	 re 	 	in	the	grand	canyon	.
and	i	had	never	 be 	 en 	 	a	 read 	 er 	 	when	i	was	young	--	my	dad	had	 tri 	 ed 	 	me	with	the	 hard 	 y 	 	 boy 	 s 	 	;	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	nancy	drew	;	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	all	that	--	and	i	just	did	n't	like	 read 	 ing 	 	 book 	 s 	 	.
and	my	mother	 b 	 ought 	 	 th 	 is 	 	book	when	we	 we 	 re 	 	at	the	grand	canyon	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	hot	zone	.	``	it	was	all	about	the	 out 	 break 	 	of	the	 eb 	 ola 	 	virus	.
and	 some 	 thing 	 	about	it	just	kind	of	drew	me	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	it	.
there	was	 th 	 is 	 	big	sort	of	 bump 	 y 	 	-	looking	virus	on	the	cover	,	and	i	just	 want 	 ed 	 	to	read	it	.	i	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	that	book	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	we	drove	from	the	edge	of	the	grand	canyon	to	big	sur	,	and	to	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	here	where	we	are	 to 	 day 	 	,	in	monterey	,	i	read	that	book	,	and	from	when	i	was	 read 	 ing 	 	that	book	,	i	 k 	 new 	 	that	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	have	a	life	in	medicine	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	like	the	 explore 	 rs 	 	i	'd	read	about	in	the	book	,	who	went	 in 	 to 	 	the	 jungle 	 s 	 	of	africa	,	went	 in 	 to 	 	the	research	 lab 	 s 	 	and	just	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	figure	out	what	 th 	 is 	 	 dead 	 ly 	 	virus	was	.	so	from	that	moment	on	,	i	read	every	medical	book	i	could	get	my	 hand 	 s 	 	on	,	and	i	just	 love 	 d 	 	it	so	much	.
i	was	a	 pass 	 ive 	 	 observ 	 er 	 	of	the	medical	world	.
it	was	n't	 un 	 til 	 	i	 enter 	 ed 	 	high	school	that	i	thought	,	``	 may 	 be 	 	now	,	you	know	--	 be 	 ing 	 	a	big	high	school	kid	--	i	can	 may 	 be 	 	 be 	 come 	 	an	active	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	big	medical	world	.	``
i	was	14	,	and	i	 email 	 ed 	 	 professor 	 s 	 	at	the	local	university	to	see	if	 may 	 be 	 	i	could	go	work	in	 the 	 ir 	 	lab	.	and	 hard 	 ly 	 	 any 	 one 	 	 respond 	 ed 	 	.
but	i	mean	,	why	would	they	respond	to	a	14	-	year	-	old	,	 any 	 way 	 	?
and	i	got	to	go	talk	to	one	professor	,	dr.	jacobs	,	who	 accept 	 ed 	 	me	 in 	 to 	 	the	lab	.
at	that	time	,	i	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 neuro 	 science 	 	and	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	a	research	project	in	 neuro 	 logy 	 	--	 specific 	 ally 	 	looking	at	the	 effect 	 s 	 	of	heavy	 metal 	 s 	 	on	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	nervous	system	.
so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	that	,	and	 work 	 ed 	 	in	his	lab	for	a	year	,	and	found	the	 result 	 s 	 	that	i	guess	you	'd	expect	to	find	when	you	feed	fruit	flies	heavy	 metal 	 s 	 	--	that	it	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 impair 	 ed 	 	the	nervous	system	.
the	 spin 	 al 	 	cord	had	 break 	 s 	 	.	the	 neuro 	 ns 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 cross 	 ing 	 	in	every	which	way	.
and	from	then	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	look	not	at	 impair 	 ment 	 	,	but	at	 prevent 	 ion 	 	of	 impair 	 ment 	 	.
so	that	's	what	led	me	to	alzheimer	's	.	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 read 	 ing 	 	about	alzheimer	's	and	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	 familiar 	 ize 	 	 my 	 self 	 	with	the	research	,	and	at	the	same	time	when	i	was	in	the	--	i	was	 read 	 ing 	 	in	the	medical	library	one	day	,	and	i	read	 th 	 is 	 	article	about	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 pur 	 ine 	 	 deriv 	 ative 	 s 	 	.	``
and	they	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	have	cell	growth	-	promoting	 proper 	 ties 	 	.
and	 be 	 ing 	 	naive	about	the	whole	field	,	i	kind	of	thought	,	``	oh	,	you	have	cell	death	in	alzheimer	's	which	is	 caus 	 ing 	 	the	 memor 	 y 	 	 defici 	 t 	 	,	and	then	you	have	 th 	 is 	 	 com 	 pound 	 	--	 pur 	 ine 	 	 deriv 	 ative 	 s 	 	--	that	are	promoting	cell	growth	.	``
and	so	i	thought	,	``	 may 	 be 	 	if	it	can	promote	cell	growth	,	it	can	inhibit	cell	death	,	too	.	``
and	so	that	's	the	project	that	i	 pursue 	 d 	 	for	that	year	,	and	it	's	 continu 	 ing 	 	now	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	and	found	that	a	specific	 pur 	 ine 	 	 deriv 	 ative 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 gua 	 ni 	 dine 	 	``	had	 inhibit 	 ed 	 	the	cell	growth	by	 approximate 	 ly 	 	60	percent	.
so	i	 present 	 ed 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 result 	 s 	 	at	the	 inter 	 national 	 	science	fair	,	which	was	just	one	of	the	most	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 experience 	 s 	 	of	my	life	.
and	there	i	was	 a 	 ward 	 ed 	 	``	best	in	the	world	in	medicine	,	``	which	 allow 	 ed 	 	me	to	get	in	,	or	at	 l 	 east 	 	get	a	foot	in	the	door	of	the	big	medical	world	.
and	from	then	on	,	since	i	was	now	in	 th 	 is 	 	huge	 excit 	 ing 	 	world	,	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	explore	it	all	.	i	 want 	 ed 	 	it	all	at	once	,	but	 k 	 new 	 	i	could	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	get	that	.
and	i	 s 	 tumble 	 d 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	``	cancer	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	.	``
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	what	i	want	to	talk	to	you	about	 to 	 day 	 	--	about	cancer	.
at	first	when	i	heard	of	cancer	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	,	i	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	know	how	to	put	the	two	together	.	i	'd	heard	of	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	,	and	i	'd	heard	of	them	 a 	 s 	 	the	panacea	of	the	future	--	the	therapy	of	 man 	 y 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	to	come	in	the	future	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	.
but	i	'd	heard	of	cancer	 a 	 s 	 	the	most	 fear 	 ed 	 	disease	of	our	time	,	so	how	did	the	good	and	bad	go	together	?
last	summer	i	 work 	 ed 	 	at	stanford	university	,	 do 	 ing 	 	some	research	on	cancer	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	.
and	while	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	was	 read 	 ing 	 	the	cancer	 liter 	 ature 	 	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	--	 aga 	 in 	 	--	 familiar 	 ize 	 	 my 	 self 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	new	medical	field	.
and	it	 seem 	 ed 	 	that	 tumor 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	begin	from	a	stem	cell	.
 th 	 is 	 	 fascinate 	 d 	 	me	.	the	more	i	read	,	the	more	i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	cancer	 different 	 ly 	 	and	 al 	 most 	 	 be 	 came 	 	less	 fear 	 ful 	 	of	it	.
it	 seem 	 s 	 	that	cancer	is	a	direct	result	to	 in 	 jury 	 	.
if	you	smoke	,	you	damage	your	lung	tissue	,	and	then	lung	cancer	 arise 	 s 	 	.
if	you	drink	,	you	damage	your	liver	,	and	then	liver	cancer	 occur 	 s 	 	.
and	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	--	there	 we 	 re 	 	 article 	 s 	 	 cor 	 relat 	 ing 	 	if	you	have	a	bone	fracture	,	and	then	bone	cancer	 arise 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	what	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	are	--	they	're	these	 phenomen 	 al 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	have	the	ability	to	 different 	 iate 	 	 in 	 to 	 	any	type	of	tissue	.
so	,	if	the	body	is	 sens 	 ing 	 	that	you	have	damage	to	an	organ	and	then	it	's	 initi 	 ating 	 	cancer	,	it	's	 al 	 most 	 	 a 	 s 	 	if	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	repair	 respons 	 e 	 	.
and	the	cancer	,	the	body	is	 say 	 ing 	 	the	lung	tissue	is	 damage 	 d 	 	,	we	need	to	repair	the	lung	.	and	cancer	is	 origin 	 ating 	 	in	the	lung	 try 	 ing 	 	to	repair	--	 be 	 cause 	 	you	have	 th 	 is 	 	 excess 	 ive 	 	 pro 	 life 	 ration 	 	of	these	 remark 	 able 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	have	the	potential	to	 be 	 come 	 	lung	tissue	.
but	it	's	 al 	 most 	 	 a 	 s 	 	if	the	body	 ha 	 s 	 	 origin 	 ated 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 ing 	 en 	 ious 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	,	but	ca	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	control	it	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	yet	 be 	 come 	 	fine	-	tuned	 en 	 ough 	 	to	finish	what	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 initi 	 ated 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 fascinate 	 d 	 	me	.
and	i	 re 	 ally 	 	think	that	we	ca	n't	think	about	cancer	--	let	 al 	 one 	 	any	disease	--	in	 s 	 uch 	 	black	-	and	-	white	 term 	 s 	 	.
if	we	eliminate	cancer	the	way	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	now	,	with	 chemo 	 therapy 	 	and	 radi 	 ation 	 	,	we	're	 bombard 	 ing 	 	the	body	or	the	cancer	with	 toxin 	 s 	 	,	or	with	 radi 	 ation 	 	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	kill	it	.	it	's	 al 	 most 	 	 a 	 s 	 	if	we	're	 get 	 ting 	 	back	to	 th 	 is 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	point	.
we	're	 re 	 moving 	 	the	cancer	 cell 	 s 	 	,	but	we	're	 reveal 	 ing 	 	the	previous	damage	that	the	body	 ha 	 s 	 	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	fix	.
should	n't	we	think	about	 manipul 	 ation 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 elimi 	 nation 	 	?
if	 some 	 how 	 	we	can	cause	these	 cell 	 s 	 	to	 different 	 iate 	 	--	to	 be 	 come 	 	bone	tissue	,	lung	tissue	,	liver	tissue	,	 what 	 ever 	 	that	cancer	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	put	there	to	do	--	it	would	be	a	repair	process	.	we	'd	end	up	better	than	we	 we 	 re 	 	before	cancer	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 change 	 d 	 	my	view	of	looking	at	cancer	.
and	while	i	was	 read 	 ing 	 	all	these	 article 	 s 	 	about	cancer	,	it	 seem 	 ed 	 	that	the	 article 	 s 	 	--	a	lot	of	them	--	focused	on	,	you	know	,	the	 genetic 	 s 	 	of	breast	cancer	,	and	the	genesis	and	the	 progress 	 ion 	 	of	breast	cancer	--	 track 	 ing 	 	the	cancer	through	the	body	,	 trac 	 ing 	 	where	it	is	,	where	it	 go 	 es 	 	.
but	it	 s 	 truck 	 	me	that	i	'd	never	heard	of	cancer	of	the	heart	,	or	cancer	of	any	skeletal	muscle	for	that	matter	.
and	skeletal	muscle	 constitute 	 s 	 	50	percent	of	our	body	,	or	over	50	percent	of	our	body	.	and	so	at	first	i	kind	of	thought	,	``	well	,	 may 	 be 	 	there	's	some	obvious	 explan 	 ation 	 	why	skeletal	muscle	 do 	 es 	 	n't	get	cancer	--	at	 l 	 east 	 	not	that	i	know	of	.	``
so	,	i	 look 	 ed 	 	further	 in 	 to 	 	it	,	found	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 article 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	i	could	,	and	it	was	 amaz 	 ing 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	that	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	rare	.
some	 article 	 s 	 	even	went	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	to	say	that	skeletal	muscle	tissue	is	resistant	to	cancer	,	and	 further 	 more 	 	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	to	cancer	,	but	of	 metasta 	 s 	 es 	 	going	to	skeletal	muscle	.
and	what	 metasta 	 s 	 es 	 	are	is	when	the	tumor	--	when	a	piece	--	 break 	 s 	 	off	and	 travel 	 s 	 	through	the	blood	stream	and	 go 	 es 	 	to	a	different	organ	.	that	's	what	a	 metasta 	 sis 	 	is	.
it	's	the	part	of	cancer	that	is	the	most	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
if	cancer	was	 local 	 ized 	 	,	we	could	 like 	 ly 	 	 re 	 move 	 	it	,	or	 some 	 how 	 	--	you	know	,	it	's	 contain 	 ed 	 	.	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 contain 	 ed 	 	.
but	once	it	 start 	 s 	 	moving	 through 	 out 	 	the	body	,	that	's	when	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 dead 	 ly 	 	.
so	the	fact	that	not	 on 	 ly 	 	did	cancer	not	seem	to	 origin 	 ate 	 	in	skeletal	 muscle 	 s 	 	,	but	cancer	did	n't	seem	to	go	to	skeletal	muscle	--	there	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	be	 some 	 thing 	 	here	.
so	these	 article 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	you	know	,	``	skeletal	--	 metasta 	 sis 	 	to	skeletal	muscle	--	is	 ver 	 y 	 	rare	.	``
but	it	was	left	at	that	.	no	one	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	be	 ask 	 ing 	 	why	.
so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	ask	why	.	at	first	--	the	first	thing	i	did	was	i	 email 	 ed 	 	some	 professor 	 s 	 	who	 special 	 ized 	 	in	skeletal	muscle	physiology	,	and	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	it	 seem 	 s 	 	like	cancer	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	go	to	skeletal	muscle	.	is	there	a	reason	for	 th 	 is 	 	?	``	and	a	lot	of	the	 re 	 plies 	 	i	got	 we 	 re 	 	that	muscle	is	 terminal 	 ly 	 	 different 	 iated 	 	tissue	.
meaning	that	you	have	muscle	 cell 	 s 	 	,	but	they	're	not	 divid 	 ing 	 	,	so	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	seem	like	a	good	target	for	cancer	to	hijack	.
but	then	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	fact	that	the	 metasta 	 s 	 es 	 	did	n't	go	to	skeletal	muscle	made	that	seem	 un 	 like 	 ly 	 	.
and	 further 	 more 	 	,	that	nervous	tissue	--	brain	--	 get 	 s 	 	cancer	,	and	brain	 cell 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 so 	 	 terminal 	 ly 	 	 different 	 iated 	 	.
so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	ask	why	.	and	here	's	some	of	,	i	guess	,	my	 hypo 	 these 	 s 	 	that	i	'll	be	 start 	 ing 	 	to	investigate	 th 	 is 	 	may	at	the	sylvester	cancer	institute	in	miami	.
and	i	guess	i	'll	keep	 invest 	 ig 	 ating 	 	 un 	 til 	 	i	get	the	 answer 	 s 	 	.
but	i	know	that	in	science	,	once	you	get	the	 answer 	 s 	 	,	 inevit 	 ably 	 	you	're	going	to	have	more	 question 	 s 	 	.
so	i	guess	you	could	say	that	i	'll	 prob 	 ably 	 	be	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	for	the	rest	of	my	life	.
some	of	my	 hypo 	 these 	 s 	 	are	that	when	you	first	think	about	skeletal	muscle	,	there	's	a	lot	of	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	going	to	skeletal	muscle	.
and	the	first	thing	that	 make 	 s 	 	me	think	is	that	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	are	like	 high 	 ways 	 	for	the	tumor	 cell 	 s 	 	.
tumor	 cell 	 s 	 	can	travel	through	the	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	.
and	you	think	,	the	more	 high 	 ways 	 	there	are	in	a	tissue	,	the	more	 like 	 ly 	 	it	is	to	get	cancer	or	to	get	 metasta 	 s 	 es 	 	.
so	first	of	all	i	thought	,	you	know	,	``	would	n't	it	be	 favor 	 able 	 	to	cancer	 get 	 ting 	 	to	skeletal	muscle	?	``	and	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	cancer	 tumor 	 s 	 	 requir 	 e 	 	a	process	 call 	 ed 	 	 angio 	 genesis 	 	,	which	is	 re 	 ally 	 	,	the	tumor	 recruit 	 s 	 	the	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	to	 it 	 self 	 	to	supply	 it 	 self 	 	with	 nutrient 	 s 	 	so	it	can	grow	.
 with 	 out 	 	 angio 	 genesis 	 	,	the	tumor	 remain 	 s 	 	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	 pin 	 point 	 	and	it	's	not	 harm 	 ful 	 	.
so	 angio 	 genesis 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	a	central	process	to	the	 patho 	 genesis 	 	of	cancer	.
and	one	article	that	 re 	 ally 	 	stood	out	to	me	when	i	was	just	 read 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	why	cancer	 do 	 es 	 	n't	go	to	skeletal	muscle	,	was	that	it	had	 report 	 ed 	 	16	percent	of	micro	-	 metasta 	 s 	 es 	 	to	skeletal	muscle	 up 	 on 	 	 au 	 topsy 	 	.
16	percent	!	meaning	that	there	 we 	 re 	 	these	 pin 	 point 	 	 tumor 	 s 	 	in	skeletal	muscle	,	but	 on 	 ly 	 	.16	percent	of	actual	 metasta 	 s 	 es 	 	--	 suggest 	 ing 	 	that	 may 	 be 	 	skeletal	muscle	is	able	to	control	the	 angio 	 genesis 	 	,	is	able	to	control	the	 tumor 	 s 	 	 recruit 	 ing 	 	these	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	.
we	use	skeletal	 muscle 	 s 	 	so	much	.	it	's	the	one	 port 	 ion 	 	of	our	body	--	our	heart	's	 al 	 ways 	 	 beat 	 ing 	 	.	we	're	 al 	 ways 	 	moving	our	 muscle 	 s 	 	.
is	it	possible	that	muscle	 some 	 how 	 	 intuitive 	 ly 	 	 know 	 s 	 	that	it	 need 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	blood	supply	?	it	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 constant 	 ly 	 	 contract 	 ing 	 	,	so	 there 	 fore 	 	it	's	 al 	 most 	 	 self 	 ish 	 	.	it	's	 grab 	 bing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	for	 it 	 self 	 	.
 there 	 fore 	 	,	when	a	tumor	 come 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	skeletal	muscle	tissue	,	it	ca	n't	get	a	blood	supply	,	and	ca	n't	grow	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 suggest 	 s 	 	that	 may 	 be 	 	if	there	is	an	anti	-	 angio 	 genic 	 	factor	in	skeletal	muscle	--	or	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	even	more	,	an	 angio 	 genic 	 	 r 	 out 	 ing 	 	factor	,	so	it	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	direct	where	the	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	grow	--
 th 	 is 	 	could	be	a	potential	future	therapy	for	cancer	.
and	 an 	 other 	 	thing	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	that	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	whole	--	the	way	 tumor 	 s 	 	move	 through 	 out 	 	the	body	,	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	complex	system	--	and	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 chemo 	 kine 	 	network	.
and	 chemo 	 kine 	 s 	 	are	 essential 	 ly 	 	chemical	 attract 	 ants 	 	,	and	they	're	the	stop	and	go	 signal 	 s 	 	for	cancer	.
so	a	tumor	 express 	 es 	 	 chemo 	 kine 	 	 receptor 	 s 	 	,	and	 an 	 other 	 	organ	--	a	 di 	 stant 	 	organ	 some 	 where 	 	in	the	body	--	will	have	the	 correspond 	 ing 	 	 chemo 	 kine 	 s 	 	,	and	the	tumor	will	see	these	 chemo 	 kine 	 s 	 	and	 migr 	 ate 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	it	.
is	it	possible	that	skeletal	muscle	 do 	 es 	 	n't	express	 th 	 is 	 	type	of	 molecule 	 s 	 	?
and	the	other	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	is	that	when	skeletal	muscle	--	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 report 	 s 	 	that	when	skeletal	muscle	is	 inju 	 red 	 	,	that	's	what	 correlate 	 s 	 	with	 metasta 	 s 	 es 	 	going	to	skeletal	muscle	.
and	,	 further 	 more 	 	,	when	skeletal	muscle	is	 inju 	 red 	 	,	that	's	what	 cause 	 s 	 	 chemo 	 kine 	 s 	 	--	these	 signal 	 s 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	cancer	,	you	can	come	to	me	,	``	the	``	go	 sign 	 s 	 	``	for	the	 tumor 	 s 	 	--	it	 cause 	 s 	 	them	to	 high 	 ly 	 	express	these	 chemo 	 kine 	 s 	 	.
so	,	there	's	so	much	 inter 	 play 	 	here	.
i	mean	,	there	are	so	 man 	 y 	 	 possibil 	 ities 	 	for	why	 tumor 	 s 	 	do	n't	go	to	skeletal	muscle	.
but	it	 seem 	 s 	 	like	by	 invest 	 ig 	 ating 	 	,	by	 attack 	 ing 	 	cancer	,	by	 search 	 ing 	 	where	cancer	is	not	,	there	 ha 	 s 	 	got	to	be	 some 	 thing 	 	--	there	's	got	to	be	 some 	 thing 	 	--	that	's	making	 th 	 is 	 	tissue	resistant	to	 tumor 	 s 	 	.
and	can	we	 util 	 ize 	 	--	can	we	take	 th 	 is 	 	 proper 	 ty 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 com 	 pound 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	receptor	,	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	that	's	 controll 	 ing 	 	these	anti	-	tumor	 proper 	 ties 	 	and	 app 	 ly 	 	it	to	cancer	therapy	in	general	?
now	,	one	thing	that	kind	of	ties	the	 resist 	 ance 	 	of	skeletal	muscle	to	cancer	--	to	the	cancer	 a 	 s 	 	a	repair	 respons 	 e 	 	gone	out	of	control	in	the	body	--	is	that	skeletal	muscle	 ha 	 s 	 	a	factor	in	it	 call 	 ed 	 	``	myod	.	``
and	what	myod	 essential 	 ly 	 	 do 	 es 	 	is	,	it	 cause 	 s 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	to	 different 	 iate 	 	 in 	 to 	 	muscle	 cell 	 s 	 	.	so	 th 	 is 	 	 com 	 pound 	 	,	myod	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	tested	on	a	lot	of	different	cell	 type 	 s 	 	and	 be 	 en 	 	 show 	 n 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	convert	 th 	 is 	 	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	cell	 type 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	skeletal	muscle	 cell 	 s 	 	.
so	,	is	it	possible	that	the	tumor	 cell 	 s 	 	are	going	to	the	skeletal	muscle	tissue	,	but	once	in	contact	 in 	 side 	 	the	skeletal	muscle	tissue	,	myod	 act 	 s 	 	 up 	 on 	 	these	tumor	 cell 	 s 	 	and	 cause 	 s 	 	them	to	 be 	 come 	 	skeletal	muscle	 cell 	 s 	 	?
 may 	 be 	 	tumor	 cell 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 dis 	 guise 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	skeletal	muscle	 cell 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	why	it	 seem 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	if	it	is	so	rare	.
it	's	not	 harm 	 ful 	 	;	it	 ha 	 s 	 	just	 repair 	 ed 	 	the	muscle	.
muscle	is	 constant 	 ly 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	used	--	 constant 	 ly 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 damage 	 d 	 	.
if	every	time	we	 to 	 re 	 	a	muscle	or	every	time	we	 stretch 	 ed 	 	a	muscle	or	 move 	 d 	 	in	a	wrong	way	,	cancer	 occur 	 red 	 	--	i	mean	,	 every 	 body 	 	would	have	cancer	 al 	 most 	 	.
and	i	hate	to	say	that	.	but	it	 seem 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	muscle	cell	,	possibly	 be 	 cause 	 	of	all	 it 	 s 	 	use	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 adapt 	 ed 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	than	other	body	 tissue 	 s 	 	to	respond	to	 in 	 jury 	 	,	to	fine	-	tune	 th 	 is 	 	repair	 respons 	 e 	 	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	able	to	finish	the	process	which	the	body	 want 	 s 	 	to	finish	.	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	the	human	body	is	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	smart	,	and	we	ca	n't	 counter 	 act 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	the	body	is	 say 	 ing 	 	to	do	.
it	's	different	when	a	bacteria	 come 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	body	--	that	's	a	foreign	object	--	we	want	that	out	.
but	when	the	body	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 initi 	 ating 	 	a	process	and	we	're	 call 	 ing 	 	it	a	disease	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	seem	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	 elimi 	 nation 	 	is	the	right	solution	.	so	even	to	go	from	there	,	it	's	possible	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	far	-	 fetch 	 ed 	 	,	that	in	the	future	we	could	 al 	 most 	 	think	of	cancer	 be 	 ing 	 	used	 a 	 s 	 	a	therapy	.
if	 t 	 hose 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	where	 tissue 	 s 	 	are	 deterio 	 rating 	 	--	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	alzheimer	's	,	where	the	brain	,	the	brain	 cell 	 s 	 	,	die	and	we	need	to	 re 	 store 	 	new	brain	 cell 	 s 	 	,	new	functional	brain	 cell 	 s 	 	--	what	if	we	could	,	in	the	future	,	use	cancer	?	a	tumor	--	put	it	in	the	brain	and	cause	it	to	 different 	 iate 	 	 in 	 to 	 	brain	 cell 	 s 	 	?
that	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	far	-	 fetch 	 ed 	 	idea	,	but	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	it	may	be	possible	.
these	 cell 	 s 	 	are	so	 versa 	 tile 	 	,	these	cancer	 cell 	 s 	 	are	so	 versa 	 tile 	 	--	we	just	have	to	 manipul 	 ate 	 	them	in	the	right	way	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	some	of	these	may	be	far	-	 fetch 	 ed 	 	,	but	i	 figur 	 ed 	 	if	there	's	 any 	 where 	 	to	present	far	-	 fetch 	 ed 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	,	it	's	here	at	ted	,	so	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
