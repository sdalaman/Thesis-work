the	first	thing	i	want	to	do	is	say	thank	you	to	all	of	you	.
the	second	thing	i	want	to	do	is	 introduc 	 e 	 	my	co	-	author	and	dear	friend	and	co	-	teacher	.
ken	and	i	have	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	together	for	 al 	 most 	 	40	 year 	 s 	 	.
that	's	ken	sharpe	over	there	.
so	there	is	among	 man 	 y 	 	people	--	 certain 	 ly 	 	me	and	most	of	the	people	i	talk	to	--	a	kind	of	 collect 	 ive 	 	 dis 	 satisfaction 	 	with	the	way	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 work 	 ing 	 	,	with	the	way	our	 institution 	 s 	 	run	.
our	 kid 	 s 	 	'	 teacher 	 s 	 	seem	to	be	 fail 	 ing 	 	them	.
our	 doctor 	 s 	 	do	n't	know	who	the	hell	we	are	,	and	they	do	n't	have	 en 	 ough 	 	time	for	us	.
we	 certain 	 ly 	 	ca	n't	trust	the	 bank 	 ers 	 	,	and	we	 certain 	 ly 	 	ca	n't	trust	the	 broker 	 s 	 	.
they	 al 	 most 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	the	entire	financial	system	down	.
and	even	 a 	 s 	 	we	do	our	own	work	,	all	too	often	,	we	find	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	 choos 	 e 	 	between	 do 	 ing 	 	what	we	think	is	the	right	thing	and	 do 	 ing 	 	the	 expect 	 ed 	 	thing	,	or	the	 requir 	 ed 	 	thing	,	or	the	 profit 	 able 	 	thing	.
so	 every 	 where 	 	we	look	,	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 a 	 cross 	 	the	board	,	we	worry	that	the	people	we	depend	on	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	have	our	 interest 	 s 	 	at	heart	.
or	if	they	do	have	our	 interest 	 s 	 	at	heart	,	we	worry	that	they	do	n't	know	us	well	 en 	 ough 	 	to	figure	out	what	they	need	to	do	in	order	to	allow	us	to	secure	 t 	 hose 	 	 interest 	 s 	 	.
they	do	n't	understand	us	.
they	do	n't	have	the	time	to	get	to	know	us	.
there	are	two	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 respons 	 es 	 	that	we	make	to	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	general	 dis 	 satisfaction 	 	.
if	 thing 	 s 	 	are	n't	going	right	,	the	first	 respons 	 e 	 	is	:	let	's	make	more	 rule 	 s 	 	,	let	's	set	up	a	set	of	 detail 	 ed 	 	 procedure 	 s 	 	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	people	will	do	the	right	thing	.
give	 teacher 	 s 	 	 script 	 s 	 	to	follow	in	the	 class 	 room 	 	,	so	even	if	they	do	n't	know	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	and	do	n't	care	about	the	 wel 	 fare 	 	of	our	 kid 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	they	follow	the	 script 	 s 	 	,	our	 kid 	 s 	 	will	get	educated	.
give	 judg 	 es 	 	a	list	of	 man 	 d 	 atory 	 	 sentence 	 s 	 	to	impose	for	 crime 	 s 	 	,	so	that	you	do	n't	need	to	 re 	 ly 	 	on	 judg 	 es 	 	using	 the 	 ir 	 	judgment	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	all	they	have	to	do	is	look	up	on	the	list	what	kind	of	sentence	 go 	 es 	 	with	what	kind	of	crime	.
impose	 limit 	 s 	 	on	what	credit	card	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	can	charge	in	interest	and	on	what	they	can	charge	in	 fee 	 s 	 	.
more	and	more	 rule 	 s 	 	to	protect	us	against	an	 in 	 different 	 	,	 un 	 car 	 ing 	 	set	of	 institution 	 s 	 	we	have	to	deal	with	.
or	--	or	 may 	 be 	 	and	--	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	 rule 	 s 	 	,	let	's	see	if	we	can	come	up	with	some	 re 	 ally 	 	clever	 incentive 	 s 	 	so	that	,	even	if	the	people	we	deal	with	do	n't	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	want	to	serve	our	 interest 	 s 	 	,	it	is	in	 the 	 ir 	 	interest	to	serve	our	interest	--	the	magic	 incentive 	 s 	 	that	will	get	people	to	do	the	right	thing	even	out	of	 pur 	 e 	 	 self 	 ish 	 ness 	 	.
so	we	 off 	 er 	 	 teacher 	 s 	 	 bon 	 uses 	 	if	the	 kid 	 s 	 	they	teach	score	 pass 	 ing 	 	 grade 	 s 	 	on	these	big	test	 score 	 s 	 	that	are	used	to	evaluate	the	quality	of	school	 system 	 s 	 	.
 rule 	 s 	 	and	 incentive 	 s 	 	--	``	 stick 	 s 	 	``	and	``	 carrot 	 s 	 	.	``
we	 pass 	 ed 	 	a	bunch	of	 rule 	 s 	 	to	 regulat 	 e 	 	the	financial	industry	in	 respons 	 e 	 	to	the	 re 	 cent 	 	collapse	.
there	's	the	dodd	-	frank	act	,	there	's	the	new	consumer	financial	 protect 	 ion 	 	 age 	 ncy 	 	that	is	 tempor 	 arily 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	headed	through	the	 back 	 door 	 	by	elizabeth	warren	.
 may 	 be 	 	these	 rule 	 s 	 	will	 actual 	 ly 	 	improve	the	way	these	financial	 service 	 s 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	 behav 	 e 	 	.
we	'll	see	.
in	 add 	 ition 	 	,	we	are	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	to	find	some	way	to	create	 incentive 	 s 	 	for	people	in	the	financial	 service 	 s 	 	industry	that	will	have	them	more	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 serv 	 ing 	 	the	long	-	term	 interest 	 s 	 	even	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 secu 	 ring 	 	short	-	term	 profit 	 s 	 	.
so	if	we	find	just	the	right	 incentive 	 s 	 	,	they	'll	do	the	right	thing	--	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	--	 self 	 ish 	 ly 	 	,	and	if	we	come	up	with	the	right	 rule 	 s 	 	and	 regulat 	 ions 	 	,	they	wo	n't	drive	us	all	over	a	cliff	.
and	ken	[	sharpe	]	and	i	 certain 	 ly 	 	know	that	you	need	to	reign	in	the	 bank 	 ers 	 	.
if	there	is	a	 less 	 on 	 	to	be	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	the	financial	collapse	it	is	that	.
but	what	we	 believ 	 e 	 	,	and	what	we	 argu 	 e 	 	in	the	book	,	is	that	there	is	no	set	of	 rule 	 s 	 	,	no	matter	how	 detail 	 ed 	 	,	no	matter	how	specific	,	no	matter	how	 care 	 fully 	 	 monitor 	 ed 	 	and	 enforce 	 d 	 	,	there	is	no	set	of	 rule 	 s 	 	that	will	get	us	what	we	need	.
why	?	 be 	 cause 	 	 bank 	 ers 	 	are	smart	people	.
and	,	like	water	,	they	will	find	 crack 	 s 	 	in	any	set	of	 rule 	 s 	 	.
you	design	a	set	of	 rule 	 s 	 	that	will	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	the	 part 	 icular 	 	reason	why	the	financial	system	``	 al 	 most 	 	-	collapse	``	ca	n't	happen	 aga 	 in 	 	.
it	is	naive	beyond	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	to	think	that	 hav 	 ing 	 	 block 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	source	of	financial	collapse	,	you	have	 block 	 ed 	 	all	possible	 source 	 s 	 	of	financial	collapse	.
so	it	's	just	a	question	of	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	the	next	one	and	then	 marvel 	 ing 	 	at	how	we	could	have	 be 	 en 	 	so	stupid	 a 	 s 	 	not	to	protect	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	against	that	.
what	we	 desperate 	 ly 	 	need	,	beyond	,	or	 a 	 long 	 	with	,	better	 rule 	 s 	 	and	 reason 	 ably 	 	smart	 incentive 	 s 	 	,	is	we	need	virtue	.	we	need	character	.	we	need	people	who	want	to	do	the	right	thing	.
and	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	the	virtue	that	we	need	most	of	all	is	the	virtue	that	aristotle	 call 	 ed 	 	``	practical	 wis 	 dom 	 	.	``
practical	 wis 	 dom 	 	is	the	moral	will	to	do	the	right	thing	and	the	moral	skill	to	figure	out	what	the	right	thing	is	.
so	aristotle	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 watch 	 ing 	 	how	the	 craft 	 s 	 men 	 	around	him	 work 	 ed 	 	.
and	he	was	 impress 	 ed 	 	at	how	they	would	 improv 	 ise 	 	novel	 solution 	 s 	 	to	novel	 problem 	 s 	 	--	 problem 	 s 	 	that	they	had	n't	 anticip 	 ated 	 	.
so	one	 ex 	 ample 	 	is	he	 s 	 ees 	 	these	 stone 	 mason 	 s 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	the	isle	of	lesbos	,	and	they	need	to	measure	out	round	 column 	 s 	 	.
well	if	you	think	about	it	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	to	measure	out	round	 column 	 s 	 	using	a	 rul 	 er 	 	.
so	what	do	they	do	?
they	fashion	a	novel	solution	to	the	problem	.
they	 create 	 d 	 	a	 rul 	 er 	 	that	 bend 	 s 	 	,	what	we	would	call	these	 day 	 s 	 	a	tape	measure	--	a	 flex 	 ible 	 	rule	,	a	rule	that	 bend 	 s 	 	.
and	aristotle	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	hah	,	they	 appreciate 	 d 	 	that	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	to	design	 round 	 ed 	 	 column 	 s 	 	,	you	need	to	bend	the	rule	.	``
and	aristotle	 s 	 aid 	 	often	in	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	other	people	,	we	need	to	bend	the	 rule 	 s 	 	.
 deal 	 ing 	 	with	other	people	 demand 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	 flex 	 ibility 	 	that	no	set	of	 rule 	 s 	 	can	 en 	 compass 	 	.
wise	people	know	when	and	how	to	bend	the	 rule 	 s 	 	.
wise	people	know	how	to	 improv 	 ise 	 	.
the	way	my	co	-	author	,	ken	,	and	i	talk	about	it	,	they	are	kind	of	like	jazz	 music 	 ians 	 	.	the	 rule 	 s 	 	are	like	the	 note 	 s 	 	on	the	page	,	and	that	 get 	 s 	 	you	 start 	 ed 	 	,	but	then	you	dance	around	the	 note 	 s 	 	on	the	page	,	coming	up	with	just	the	right	combination	for	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	moment	with	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	set	of	fellow	 player 	 s 	 	.
so	for	aristotle	,	the	kind	of	rule	-	 bend 	 ing 	 	,	rule	exception	-	 find 	 ing 	 	and	improvisation	that	you	see	in	 skill 	 ed 	 	 craft 	 s 	 men 	 	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	you	need	to	be	a	 skill 	 ed 	 	moral	 craft 	 s 	 man 	 	.
and	in	 interact 	 ions 	 	with	people	,	 al 	 most 	 	all	the	time	,	it	is	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 flex 	 ibility 	 	that	is	 requir 	 ed 	 	.
a	wise	person	 know 	 s 	 	when	to	bend	the	 rule 	 s 	 	.
a	wise	person	 know 	 s 	 	when	to	 improv 	 ise 	 	.
and	most	 import 	 ant 	 	,	a	wise	person	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 improv 	 is 	 ing 	 	and	rule	-	 bend 	 ing 	 	in	the	service	of	the	right	 aim 	 s 	 	.
if	you	are	a	rule	-	bender	and	an	 improv 	 is 	 er 	 	 most 	 ly 	 	to	serve	 your 	 self 	 	,	what	you	get	is	 ruth 	 less 	 	 manipul 	 ation 	 	of	other	people	.
so	it	 matter 	 s 	 	that	you	do	 th 	 is 	 	wise	practice	in	the	service	of	 other 	 s 	 	and	not	in	the	service	of	 your 	 self 	 	.
and	so	the	will	to	do	the	right	thing	is	just	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	moral	skill	of	improvisation	and	exception	-	 find 	 ing 	 	.
together	they	 com 	 prise 	 	practical	 wis 	 dom 	 	,	which	aristotle	thought	was	the	master	virtue	.
so	i	'll	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	wise	practice	in	action	.
it	's	the	case	of	michael	.
michael	's	a	young	guy	.
he	had	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	low	-	wage	job	.
he	was	 support 	 ing 	 	his	wife	and	a	child	,	and	the	child	was	going	to	parochial	school	.
then	he	lost	his	job	.
he	 panic 	 ked 	 	about	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	support	his	family	.
one	night	,	he	 d 	 rank 	 	a	little	too	much	,	and	he	 rob 	 bed 	 	a	cab	driver	--	stole	50	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
he	 rob 	 bed 	 	him	at	 gun 	 point 	 	.
it	was	a	 to 	 y 	 	gun	.
he	got	caught	.	he	got	 tri 	 ed 	 	.	he	got	 convict 	 ed 	 	.
the	pennsylvania	 s 	 ent 	 encing 	 	 guide 	 lines 	 	 requir 	 ed 	 	a	 minim 	 um 	 	sentence	for	a	crime	like	 th 	 is 	 	of	two	 year 	 s 	 	,	24	 month 	 s 	 	.
the	 judg 	 e 	 	on	the	case	,	 judg 	 e 	 	lois	forer	thought	that	 th 	 is 	 	made	no	sense	.
he	had	never	 commit 	 ted 	 	a	crime	before	.
he	was	a	 respons 	 ible 	 	husband	and	father	.
he	had	 be 	 en 	 	 face 	 d 	 	with	desperate	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	.
all	 th 	 is 	 	would	do	is	wreck	a	family	.
and	so	she	 improv 	 is 	 ed 	 	a	sentence	--	11	 month 	 s 	 	,
and	not	 on 	 ly 	 	that	,	but	 re 	 lease 	 	every	day	to	go	to	work	.
 s 	 pend 	 	your	night	in	jail	,	 s 	 pend 	 	your	day	 hold 	 ing 	 	down	a	job	.
he	did	.	he	 serv 	 ed 	 	out	his	sentence	.
he	made	 re 	 stit 	 ution 	 	and	found	 him 	 self 	 	a	new	job	.
and	the	family	was	 unit 	 ed 	 	.
and	it	 seem 	 ed 	 	on	the	road	to	some	sort	of	a	 de 	 cent 	 	life	--	a	happy	 end 	 ing 	 	to	a	story	 in 	 vol 	 v 	 ing 	 	wise	improvisation	from	a	wise	 judg 	 e 	 	.
but	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	the	 prosecut 	 or 	 	was	not	happy	that	 judg 	 e 	 	forer	 ignor 	 ed 	 	the	 s 	 ent 	 encing 	 	 guide 	 lines 	 	and	sort	of	 invent 	 ed 	 	her	own	,	and	so	he	 appeal 	 ed 	 	.
and	he	 ask 	 ed 	 	for	the	 man 	 d 	 atory 	 	 minim 	 um 	 	sentence	for	 arm 	 ed 	 	 robber 	 y 	 	.
he	did	after	all	have	a	 to 	 y 	 	gun	.
the	 man 	 d 	 atory 	 	 minim 	 um 	 	sentence	for	 arm 	 ed 	 	 robber 	 y 	 	is	five	 year 	 s 	 	.
he	won	the	appeal	.
michael	was	 sentence 	 d 	 	to	five	 year 	 s 	 	in	 pri 	 son 	 	.
 judg 	 e 	 	forer	had	to	follow	the	law	.
and	by	the	way	,	 th 	 is 	 	appeal	went	through	after	he	had	 finish 	 ed 	 	 serv 	 ing 	 	his	sentence	,	so	he	was	out	and	 work 	 ing 	 	at	a	job	and	taking	care	of	his	family	and	he	had	to	go	back	 in 	 to 	 	jail	.
 judg 	 e 	 	forer	did	what	she	was	 requir 	 ed 	 	to	do	,	and	then	she	quit	the	bench	.
and	michael	 disappear 	 ed 	 	.
so	that	is	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	both	of	 wis 	 dom 	 	in	practice	and	the	 sub 	 version 	 	of	 wis 	 dom 	 	by	 rule 	 s 	 	that	are	 me 	 ant 	 	,	of	course	,	to	make	 thing 	 s 	 	better	.
now	consider	ms.	dewey	.
ms.	dewey	's	a	teacher	in	a	texas	 element 	 ary 	 	school	.
she	found	 her 	 self 	 	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	a	 consult 	 ant 	 	one	day	who	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	help	 teacher 	 s 	 	boost	the	test	 score 	 s 	 	of	the	 kid 	 s 	 	,	so	that	the	school	would	reach	the	elite	 categor 	 y 	 	in	 percent 	 age 	 	of	 kid 	 s 	 	 pass 	 ing 	 	big	 test 	 s 	 	.
all	these	 school 	 s 	 	in	texas	compete	with	one	 an 	 other 	 	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	these	 mile 	 stone 	 s 	 	,	and	there	are	 bon 	 uses 	 	and	 vari 	 ous 	 	other	 treat 	 s 	 	that	come	if	you	beat	the	other	 school 	 s 	 	.
so	here	was	the	 consult 	 ant 	 	's	 ad 	 vice 	 	:	first	,	do	n't	waste	your	time	on	 kid 	 s 	 	who	are	going	to	pass	the	test	no	matter	what	you	do	.
second	,	do	n't	waste	your	time	on	 kid 	 s 	 	who	ca	n't	pass	the	test	no	matter	what	you	do	.
third	,	do	n't	waste	your	time	on	 kid 	 s 	 	who	 move 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 di 	 strict 	 	too	late	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 score 	 s 	 	to	be	 count 	 ed 	 	.
focus	all	of	your	time	and	attention	on	the	 kid 	 s 	 	who	are	on	the	bubble	,	the	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	``	bubble	 kid 	 s 	 	``	--	 kid 	 s 	 	where	your	intervention	can	get	them	just	 may 	 be 	 	over	the	line	from	 fail 	 ing 	 	to	 pass 	 ing 	 	.
so	ms.	dewey	heard	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	she	 s 	 hook 	 	her	head	in	despair	while	fellow	 teacher 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	sort	of	 cheer 	 ing 	 	each	other	on	and	 nod 	 d 	 ing 	 	 ap 	 prov 	 ing 	 ly 	 	.
it	's	like	they	 we 	 re 	 	about	to	go	play	a	 foot 	 ball 	 	game	.
for	ms.	dewey	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	why	she	 be 	 came 	 	a	teacher	.
now	ken	and	i	are	not	naive	,	and	we	understand	that	you	need	to	have	 rule 	 s 	 	.
you	need	to	have	 incentive 	 s 	 	.
people	have	to	make	a	living	.
but	the	problem	with	 re 	 ly 	 ing 	 	on	 rule 	 s 	 	and	 incentive 	 s 	 	is	that	they	 de 	 moralize 	 	professional	activity	,
and	they	 de 	 moralize 	 	professional	activity	in	two	 sense 	 s 	 	.
first	,	they	 de 	 moralize 	 	the	people	who	are	 engag 	 ed 	 	in	the	activity	.
 judg 	 e 	 	forer	 quit 	 s 	 	,	and	ms.	dewey	in	 complete 	 ly 	 	 dis 	 heart 	 ened 	 	.
and	second	,	they	 de 	 moralize 	 	the	activity	 it 	 self 	 	.
the	 ver 	 y 	 	practice	is	 de 	 moralize 	 d 	 	,	and	the	 practitioner 	 s 	 	are	 de 	 moralize 	 d 	 	.
it	 create 	 s 	 	people	--	when	you	 manipul 	 ate 	 	 incentive 	 s 	 	to	get	people	to	do	the	right	thing	--	it	 create 	 s 	 	people	who	are	 addict 	 ed 	 	to	 incentive 	 s 	 	.
that	is	to	say	,	it	 create 	 s 	 	people	who	 on 	 ly 	 	do	 thing 	 s 	 	for	 incentive 	 s 	 	.
now	the	 s 	 tri 	 king 	 	thing	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	 psycho 	 logists 	 	have	known	 th 	 is 	 	for	30	 year 	 s 	 	.
 psycho 	 logists 	 	have	known	about	the	negative	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	of	 in 	 cent 	 iv 	 izing 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	for	30	 year 	 s 	 	.
we	know	that	if	you	reward	 kid 	 s 	 	for	 draw 	 ing 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	,	they	stop	 car 	 ing 	 	about	the	 draw 	 ing 	 	and	care	 on 	 ly 	 	about	the	reward	.
if	you	reward	 kid 	 s 	 	for	 read 	 ing 	 	 book 	 s 	 	,	they	stop	 car 	 ing 	 	about	what	's	in	the	 book 	 s 	 	and	 on 	 ly 	 	care	about	how	long	they	are	.
if	you	reward	 teacher 	 s 	 	for	 kid 	 s 	 	'	test	 score 	 s 	 	,	they	stop	 car 	 ing 	 	about	 educ 	 ating 	 	and	 on 	 ly 	 	care	about	test	 pre 	 par 	 ation 	 	.
if	you	 we 	 re 	 	to	reward	 doctor 	 s 	 	for	 do 	 ing 	 	more	 procedure 	 s 	 	--	which	is	the	current	system	--	they	would	do	more	.
if	 in 	 stead 	 	you	reward	 doctor 	 s 	 	for	 do 	 ing 	 	 few 	 er 	 	 procedure 	 s 	 	,	they	will	do	 few 	 er 	 	.
what	we	want	,	of	course	,	is	 doctor 	 s 	 	who	do	just	the	right	amount	of	 procedure 	 s 	 	and	do	the	right	amount	for	the	right	reason	--	 name 	 ly 	 	,	to	serve	the	 wel 	 fare 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 patient 	 s 	 	.
 psycho 	 logists 	 	have	known	 th 	 is 	 	for	 decade 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	time	for	 policy 	 makers 	 	to	start	 pay 	 ing 	 	attention	and	listen	to	 psycho 	 logists 	 	a	little	bit	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 economist 	 s 	 	.
and	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	to	be	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
we	think	,	ken	and	i	,	that	there	are	real	 source 	 s 	 	of	hope	.
we	identify	one	set	of	people	in	all	of	these	 practice 	 s 	 	who	we	call	 can 	 ny 	 	 out 	 law 	 s 	 	.
these	are	people	who	,	 be 	 ing 	 	 force 	 d 	 	to	 oper 	 ate 	 	in	a	system	that	 demand 	 s 	 	rule	-	 follow 	 ing 	 	and	 create 	 s 	 	 incentive 	 s 	 	,	find	away	around	the	 rule 	 s 	 	,	find	a	way	to	 sub 	 vert 	 	the	 rule 	 s 	 	.
so	there	are	 teacher 	 s 	 	who	have	these	 script 	 s 	 	to	follow	,	and	they	know	that	if	they	follow	these	 script 	 s 	 	,	the	 kid 	 s 	 	will	learn	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
and	so	what	they	do	is	they	follow	the	 script 	 s 	 	,	but	they	follow	the	 script 	 s 	 	at	double	-	time	and	squirrel	away	little	bits	of	extra	time	 dur 	 ing 	 	which	they	teach	in	the	way	that	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	know	is	effective	.
so	these	are	little	 ordin 	 ary 	 	,	 every 	 day 	 	heroes	,	and	they	're	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 admi 	 r 	 able 	 	,	but	there	's	no	way	that	they	can	sustain	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	activity	in	the	face	of	a	system	that	either	 root 	 s 	 	them	out	or	 grind 	 s 	 	them	down	.
so	 can 	 ny 	 	 out 	 law 	 s 	 	are	better	than	 noth 	 ing 	 	,	but	it	's	hard	to	imagine	any	 can 	 ny 	 	 out 	 law 	 	 sustain 	 ing 	 	that	for	an	 in 	 definite 	 	period	of	time	.
more	 hope 	 ful 	 	are	people	we	call	system	-	 changer 	 s 	 	.
these	are	people	who	are	looking	not	to	dodge	the	system	's	 rule 	 s 	 	and	 regulat 	 ions 	 	,	but	to	transform	the	system	,	and	we	talk	about	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	.
one	in	 part 	 icular 	 	is	a	 judg 	 e 	 	named	robert	russell	.
and	one	day	he	was	 face 	 d 	 	with	the	case	of	gary	pettengill	.
pettengill	was	a	23	-	year	-	old	vet	who	had	 plan 	 ned 	 	to	make	the	 arm 	 y 	 	a	 care 	 er 	 	,	but	then	he	got	a	severe	back	 in 	 jury 	 	in	 ir 	 aq 	 	,	and	that	 force 	 d 	 	him	to	take	a	medical	 dis 	 charge 	 	.
he	was	married	,	he	had	a	third	kid	on	the	way	,	he	 suffer 	 ed 	 	from	ptsd	,	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	the	bad	back	,	and	 re 	 current 	 	 nightmare 	 s 	 	,	and	he	had	 start 	 ed 	 	using	 mar 	 ijuana 	 	to	ease	some	of	the	 symptom 	 s 	 	.
he	was	 on 	 ly 	 	able	to	get	part	-	time	work	 be 	 cause 	 	of	his	back	,	and	so	he	was	 un 	 able 	 	to	earn	 en 	 ough 	 	to	put	food	on	the	table	and	take	care	of	his	family	.
so	he	 start 	 ed 	 	selling	 mar 	 ijuana 	 	.
he	was	 bust 	 ed 	 	in	a	drug	 s 	 weep 	 	.
his	family	was	 kick 	 ed 	 	out	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	,	and	the	 wel 	 fare 	 	system	was	 threaten 	 ing 	 	to	take	away	his	 kid 	 s 	 	.
under	normal	 s 	 ent 	 encing 	 	 procedure 	 s 	 	,	 judg 	 e 	 	russell	would	have	had	little	choice	but	to	sentence	pettengill	to	serious	jail	-	time	 a 	 s 	 	a	drug	felon	.
but	 judg 	 e 	 	russell	did	have	an	 alter 	 native 	 	.
and	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	he	was	in	a	special	court	.
he	was	in	a	court	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 veteran 	 s 	 	'	court	.
in	the	 veteran 	 s 	 	'	court	--	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	first	of	 it 	 s 	 	kind	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
 judg 	 e 	 	russell	 create 	 d 	 	the	 veteran 	 s 	 	'	court	.
it	was	a	court	 on 	 ly 	 	for	 veteran 	 s 	 	who	had	broken	the	law	.
and	he	had	 create 	 d 	 	it	 exact 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 man 	 d 	 atory 	 	 s 	 ent 	 encing 	 	 law 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	taking	the	judgment	out	of	 judg 	 ing 	 	.
no	one	 want 	 ed 	 	non	-	violent	 offend 	 ers 	 	--	and	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	non	-	violent	 offend 	 ers 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	 veteran 	 s 	 	to	boot	--	to	be	 throw 	 n 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 pri 	 son 	 	.
they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	what	we	all	know	,	 name 	 ly 	 	the	 r 	 evolv 	 ing 	 	door	of	the	criminal	justice	system	.
and	what	the	 veteran 	 s 	 	'	court	did	,	was	it	 treat 	 ed 	 	each	criminal	 a 	 s 	 	an	individual	,	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	get	 in 	 side 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	,	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	fashion	 respons 	 es 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 crime 	 s 	 	that	 help 	 ed 	 	them	to	 rehabilit 	 ate 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	and	did	n't	forget	about	them	once	the	judgment	was	made	.
 stay 	 ed 	 	with	them	,	 follow 	 ed 	 	up	on	them	,	made	 s 	 ure 	 	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	 stick 	 ing 	 	to	 what 	 ever 	 	plan	had	 be 	 en 	 	 joint 	 ly 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	to	get	them	over	the	hump	.
there	are	now	22	cities	that	have	 veteran 	 s 	 	'	 court 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
why	 ha 	 s 	 	the	idea	spread	?
well	,	one	reason	is	that	 judg 	 e 	 	russell	 ha 	 s 	 	now	 s 	 een 	 	108	 vet 	 s 	 	in	his	 veteran 	 s 	 	'	court	 a 	 s 	 	of	february	of	 th 	 is 	 	year	,	and	out	of	108	,	guess	how	 man 	 y 	 	have	gone	back	through	the	 r 	 evolv 	 ing 	 	door	of	justice	 in 	 to 	 	 pri 	 son 	 	.
 non 	 e 	 	.	 non 	 e 	 	.
 any 	 one 	 	would	glom	onto	a	criminal	justice	system	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	a	record	.
so	here	's	is	a	system	-	changer	,	and	it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	 catch 	 ing 	 	.
there	's	a	 bank 	 er 	 	who	 create 	 d 	 	a	for	-	profit	community	bank	that	 encourag 	 ed 	 	 bank 	 ers 	 	--	i	know	 th 	 is 	 	is	hard	to	 believ 	 e 	 	--	 encourag 	 ed 	 	 bank 	 ers 	 	who	 work 	 ed 	 	there	to	do	well	by	 do 	 ing 	 	good	for	 the 	 ir 	 	low	-	income	 client 	 s 	 	.
the	bank	 help 	 ed 	 	finance	the	 re 	 building 	 	of	what	was	 other 	 wise 	 	a	 dy 	 ing 	 	community	.
 th 	 ough 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	loan	 recipient 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	high	-	risk	by	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 standard 	 s 	 	,	the	default	rate	was	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	low	.
the	bank	was	 profit 	 able 	 	.
the	 bank 	 ers 	 	 stay 	 ed 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	loan	 recipient 	 s 	 	.
they	did	n't	make	 loan 	 s 	 	and	then	sell	the	 loan 	 s 	 	.
they	 service 	 d 	 	the	 loan 	 s 	 	.
they	made	 s 	 ure 	 	that	 the 	 ir 	 	loan	 recipient 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 stay 	 ing 	 	up	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 payment 	 s 	 	.
 bank 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	the	way	we	read	about	it	now	in	the	 news 	 paper 	 s 	 	.
even	goldman	sachs	once	used	to	serve	 client 	 s 	 	,	before	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	an	institution	that	 serve 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 it 	 self 	 	.
 bank 	 ing 	 	was	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	 th 	 is 	 	way	,	and	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	to	be	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
so	there	are	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	in	medicine	--	 doctor 	 s 	 	at	harvard	who	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	transform	medical	education	,	so	that	you	do	n't	get	a	kind	of	 ethic 	 al 	 	 ero 	 s 	 ion 	 	and	loss	of	 empath 	 y 	 	,	which	 character 	 ize 	 s 	 	most	medical	 student 	 s 	 	in	the	course	of	 the 	 ir 	 	medical	training	.
and	the	way	they	do	it	is	to	give	third	-	year	medical	 student 	 s 	 	 patient 	 s 	 	who	they	follow	for	an	entire	year	.
so	the	 patient 	 s 	 	are	not	organ	 system 	 s 	 	,	and	they	're	not	 disease 	 s 	 	;	they	're	people	,	people	with	 live 	 s 	 	.
and	in	order	to	be	an	effective	doctor	,	you	need	to	treat	people	who	have	 live 	 s 	 	and	not	just	disease	.
in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	which	there	's	an	enormous	amount	of	back	and	forth	,	 mentor 	 ing 	 	of	one	student	by	 an 	 other 	 	,	of	all	the	 student 	 s 	 	by	the	 doctor 	 s 	 	,	and	the	result	is	a	generation	--	we	hope	--	of	 doctor 	 s 	 	who	do	have	time	for	the	people	they	treat	.
we	'll	see	.
so	there	are	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	that	we	talk	about	.
each	of	them	 show 	 s 	 	that	it	is	possible	to	build	on	and	nurture	character	and	keep	a	profession	true	to	 it 	 s 	 	proper	mission	--	what	aristotle	would	have	 call 	 ed 	 	 it 	 s 	 	proper	 tel 	 os 	 	.
and	ken	and	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 practitioner 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	want	.
people	want	to	be	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	be	virtuous	.
they	want	to	have	 per 	 mission 	 	to	do	the	right	thing	.
they	do	n't	want	to	feel	like	they	need	to	take	a	shower	to	get	the	moral	 grim 	 e 	 	off	 the 	 ir 	 	bodies	 every 	 day 	 	when	they	come	home	from	work	.
aristotle	thought	that	practical	 wis 	 dom 	 	was	the	key	to	happiness	,	and	he	was	right	.
there	's	now	a	lot	of	research	 be 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	in	 psycho 	 logy 	 	on	what	 make 	 s 	 	people	happy	,	and	the	two	 thing 	 s 	 	that	jump	out	in	 stud 	 y 	 	after	 stud 	 y 	 	--	i	know	 th 	 is 	 	will	come	 a 	 s 	 	a	shock	to	all	of	you	--	the	two	 thing 	 s 	 	that	matter	most	to	happiness	are	love	and	work	.
love	:	 man 	 aging 	 	 success 	 fully 	 	 relation 	 s 	 	with	the	people	who	are	close	to	you	and	with	the	 commun 	 ities 	 	of	which	you	are	a	part	.
work	:	 engag 	 ing 	 	in	 activ 	 ities 	 	that	are	 meaning 	 ful 	 	and	 satisfy 	 ing 	 	.
if	you	have	that	,	good	close	 relation 	 s 	 	with	other	people	,	work	that	's	 meaning 	 ful 	 	and	 fulfill 	 ing 	 	,	you	do	n't	much	need	 any 	 thing 	 	else	.
well	,	to	love	well	and	to	work	well	,	you	need	 wis 	 dom 	 	.
 rule 	 s 	 	and	 incentive 	 s 	 	do	n't	tell	you	how	to	be	a	good	friend	,	how	to	be	a	good	parent	,	how	to	be	a	good	spouse	,	or	how	to	be	a	good	doctor	or	a	good	lawyer	or	a	good	teacher	.
 rule 	 s 	 	and	 incentive 	 s 	 	are	no	 substitut 	 es 	 	for	 wis 	 dom 	 	.
 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	we	 argu 	 e 	 	,	there	is	no	 substitut 	 e 	 	for	 wis 	 dom 	 	.
and	so	practical	 wis 	 dom 	 	 do 	 es 	 	not	 requir 	 e 	 	 hero 	 ic 	 	 act 	 s 	 	of	self	-	sacrifice	on	the	part	of	 practitioner 	 s 	 	.
in	giving	us	the	will	and	the	skill	to	do	the	right	thing	--	to	do	right	by	 other 	 s 	 	--	practical	 wis 	 dom 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 give 	 s 	 	us	the	will	and	the	skill	to	do	right	by	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
 thank 	 s 	 	.
