i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	you	about	the	worst	form	of	human	 right 	 s 	 	 viol 	 ation 	 	,	the	third	-	largest	 organize 	 d 	 	crime	,	a	$	10	billion	industry	.
i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	you	about	modern	-	day	 slave 	 ry 	 	.
i	'd	like	to	tell	you	the	story	of	these	three	children	,	pranitha	,	shaheen	and	anjali	.
pranitha	's	mother	was	a	woman	in	 pro 	 stit 	 ution 	 	,	a	 prostitute 	 d 	 	person	.
she	got	 infect 	 ed 	 	with	hiv	,	and	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	end	of	her	life	,	when	she	was	in	the	final	 stage 	 s 	 	of	 aid 	 s 	 	,	she	could	not	prostitute	,	so	she	 s 	 old 	 	four	-	year	-	old	pranitha	to	a	broker	.
by	the	time	we	got	the	information	,	we	 reach 	 ed 	 	there	,	pranitha	was	 al 	 ready 	 	 rap 	 ed 	 	by	three	men	.
shaheen	's	 back 	 ground 	 	i	do	n't	even	know	.
we	found	her	in	a	 rail 	 way 	 	track	,	 rap 	 ed 	 	by	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	men	,	i	do	n't	know	 man 	 y 	 	.
but	the	 indic 	 ations 	 	of	that	on	her	body	was	that	her	intestine	was	 out 	 side 	 	her	body	.
and	when	we	took	her	to	the	hospital	she	 need 	 ed 	 	32	 stitch 	 es 	 	to	put	back	her	intestine	 in 	 to 	 	her	body	.
we	still	do	n't	know	who	her	 parent 	 s 	 	are	,	who	she	is	.
all	that	we	know	that	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	men	had	used	her	 brutal 	 ly 	 	.
anjali	's	father	,	a	 drunk 	 ard 	 	,	 s 	 old 	 	his	child	for	 porn 	 ography 	 	.
you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	here	 image 	 s 	 	of	three	 year 	 s 	 	,	four	-	year	-	olds	,	and	five	-	year	-	old	children	who	have	 be 	 en 	 	 traffic 	 ked 	 	for	commercial	sexual	 exploit 	 ation 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	country	,	and	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 glob 	 e 	 	,	 hundred 	 s 	 	and	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	children	,	 a 	 s 	 	young	 a 	 s 	 	three	,	 a 	 s 	 	young	 a 	 s 	 	four	,	are	 s 	 old 	 	 in 	 to 	 	sexual	 slave 	 ry 	 	.
but	that	's	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	purpose	that	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	are	 s 	 old 	 	for	.
they	are	 s 	 old 	 	in	the	name	of	 adopt 	 ion 	 	.
they	are	 s 	 old 	 	in	the	name	of	organ	trade	.
they	are	 s 	 old 	 	in	the	name	of	 force 	 d 	 	labor	,	camel	 joc 	 key 	 ing 	 	,	 any 	 thing 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	.
i	work	on	the	issue	of	commercial	sexual	 exploit 	 ation 	 	.
and	i	tell	you	 st 	 ories 	 	from	there	.
my	own	journey	to	work	with	these	children	 start 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	teenager	.
i	was	15	when	i	was	gang	-	 rap 	 ed 	 	by	eight	men	.
i	do	n't	remember	the	rape	part	of	it	so	much	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	the	anger	part	of	it	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	eight	men	who	 defi 	 led 	 	me	,	 rap 	 ed 	 	me	,	but	that	did	n't	go	 in 	 to 	 	my	 conscious 	 ness 	 	.
i	never	felt	like	a	victim	,	then	or	now	.
but	what	 linger 	 ed 	 	from	then	till	now	--	i	am	40	 to 	 day 	 	--	is	 th 	 is 	 	huge	 out 	 rage 	 ous 	 	anger	.
two	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	was	 os 	 trac 	 ized 	 	,	i	was	 stigma 	 t 	 ized 	 	,	i	was	 isolate 	 d 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	a	victim	.
and	that	's	what	we	do	to	all	traffic	 surviv 	 ors 	 	.
we	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	we	have	phds	in	 victim 	 izing 	 	a	victim	.
right	from	the	age	of	15	,	when	i	 start 	 ed 	 	looking	around	me	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	and	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	women	and	children	who	are	left	in	sexual	 slave 	 ry 	 	-	like	 practice 	 s 	 	,	but	have	 absolute 	 ly 	 	no	 re 	 spite 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	do	n't	allow	them	to	come	in	.
where	 do 	 es 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	journey	begin	?
most	of	them	come	from	 ver 	 y 	 	 option 	 less 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	,	not	just	poor	.
you	have	even	the	middle	class	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 traffic 	 ked 	 	.
i	had	 th 	 is 	 	i.s	.	officer	's	daughter	,	who	is	14	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	in	 n 	 in 	 th 	 	standard	,	who	was	 rap 	 ed 	 	 chat 	 ting 	 	with	one	individual	,	and	ran	away	from	home	 be 	 cause 	 	she	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	 hero 	 ine 	 	,
who	was	 traffic 	 ked 	 	.
i	have	 hundred 	 s 	 	and	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 st 	 ories 	 	of	 ver 	 y 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	well	-	to	-	do	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	,	and	children	from	well	-	to	-	do	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	,	who	are	 get 	 ting 	 	 traffic 	 ked 	 	.
these	people	are	 deceive 	 d 	 	,	 force 	 d 	 	.
99.9	percent	of	them	resist	 be 	 ing 	 	 in 	 duct 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 pro 	 stit 	 ution 	 	.
some	pay	the	price	for	it	.
they	're	 kill 	 ed 	 	;	we	do	n't	even	hear	about	them	.
they	are	 voice 	 less 	 	,	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	,	 name 	 less 	 	people	.
but	the	rest	,	who	succumb	 in 	 to 	 	it	,	go	through	 every 	 day 	 	torture	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	men	who	come	to	them	are	not	men	who	want	to	make	you	your	 girlfriend 	 s 	 	,	or	who	want	to	have	a	family	with	you	.
these	are	men	who	buy	you	for	an	hour	,	for	a	day	,	and	use	you	,	throw	you	.
each	of	the	 girl 	 s 	 	that	i	have	 rescu 	 ed 	 	--	i	have	 rescu 	 ed 	 	more	than	3,200	 girl 	 s 	 	--	each	of	them	tell	me	one	story	in	common	...
one	story	about	one	man	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	,	 put 	 ting 	 	chili	powder	in	her	vagina	,	one	man	taking	a	 cigar 	 ette 	 	and	 burn 	 ing 	 	her	,	one	man	 whip 	 ping 	 	her	.
we	are	living	among	 t 	 hose 	 	men	:	they	're	our	 brother 	 s 	 	,	 father 	 s 	 	,	 uncle 	 s 	 	,	 cousin 	 s 	 	,	all	around	us	.
and	we	are	silent	about	them	.
we	think	it	is	easy	money	.
we	think	it	is	 short 	 cut 	 	.
we	think	the	person	 like 	 s 	 	to	do	what	she	's	 do 	 ing 	 	.
but	the	extra	 bon 	 uses 	 	that	she	 get 	 s 	 	is	 vari 	 ous 	 	 infect 	 ions 	 	,	 sexual 	 ly 	 	 transmit 	 ted 	 	 infect 	 ions 	 	,	hiv	,	 aid 	 s 	 	,	syphilis	,	 go 	 no 	 rrhea 	 	,	you	name	it	,	 sub 	 stance 	 	abuse	,	 drug 	 s 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	under	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
and	one	day	she	 give 	 s 	 	up	on	you	and	me	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	no	 option 	 s 	 	for	her	.
and	 there 	 fore 	 	she	 start 	 s 	 	 normal 	 izing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 exploit 	 ation 	 	.
she	 believ 	 es 	 	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	it	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	my	 de 	 s 	 tin 	 y 	 	is	about	.	``
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	normal	,	to	get	 rap 	 ed 	 	by	100	men	a	day	.
and	it	's	 ab 	 normal 	 	to	live	in	a	shelter	.
it	's	 ab 	 normal 	 	to	get	 rehabilit 	 ated 	 	.
it	's	in	that	 con 	 text 	 	that	i	work	.
it	's	in	that	 con 	 text 	 	that	i	 rescu 	 e 	 	children	.
i	've	 rescu 	 ed 	 	children	 a 	 s 	 	young	 a 	 s 	 	three	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	i	've	 rescu 	 ed 	 	women	 a 	 s 	 	old	 a 	 s 	 	40	 year 	 s 	 	.
when	i	 rescu 	 ed 	 	them	,	one	of	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 challeng 	 es 	 	i	had	was	where	do	i	begin	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	had	 lot 	 s 	 	of	them	who	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	hiv	 infect 	 ed 	 	.
one	third	of	the	people	i	 rescu 	 e 	 	are	hiv	positive	.
and	 there 	 fore 	 	my	 challeng 	 e 	 	was	to	understand	how	can	i	get	out	the	power	from	 th 	 is 	 	pain	.
and	for	me	,	i	was	my	 great 	 est 	 	experience	.
 understand 	 ing 	 	my	own	self	,	 understand 	 ing 	 	my	own	pain	,	my	own	 isol 	 ation 	 	,	was	my	 great 	 est 	 	teacher	.
 be 	 cause 	 	what	we	did	with	these	 girl 	 s 	 	is	to	understand	 the 	 ir 	 	potential	.
you	see	a	girl	here	who	is	trained	 a 	 s 	 	a	 weld 	 er 	 	.
she	 work 	 s 	 	for	a	 ver 	 y 	 	big	company	,	a	 work 	 shop 	 	in	hyderabad	,	making	 furniture 	 s 	 	.
she	 earn 	 s 	 	around	12,000	 rupee 	 s 	 	.
she	is	an	illiterate	girl	,	trained	,	 skill 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 weld 	 er 	 	.
why	 weld 	 ing 	 	and	why	not	 computer 	 s 	 	?
we	felt	,	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	these	 girl 	 s 	 	had	is	immense	amount	of	courage	.
they	did	not	have	any	 par 	 da 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	body	,	 hijab 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	;	they	've	 cross 	 ed 	 	the	 bar 	 rier 	 	of	it	.
and	 there 	 fore 	 	they	could	fight	in	a	male	-	 dominate 	 d 	 	world	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	,	and	not	feel	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 hy 	 	about	it	.
we	have	trained	 girl 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 carp 	 enter 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 mason 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	security	 guard 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	cab	 driver 	 s 	 	.
and	each	one	of	them	are	 excel 	 ling 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 chose 	 n 	 	field	,	 gain 	 ing 	 	confidence	,	 re 	 storing 	 	dignity	,	and	building	 hope 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 live 	 s 	 	.
these	 girl 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 so 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	in	big	construction	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	like	ram	-	ki	construction	,	 a 	 s 	 	 mason 	 s 	 	,	full	-	time	 mason 	 s 	 	.
what	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	my	 challeng 	 e 	 	?
my	 challeng 	 e 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 be 	 en 	 	the	 traffic 	 ker 	 s 	 	who	beat	me	up	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 beat 	 en 	 	up	more	than	14	 time 	 s 	 	in	my	life	.
i	ca	n't	hear	from	my	right	ear	.
i	've	lost	a	staff	of	mine	who	was	 murder 	 ed 	 	while	on	a	 rescu 	 e 	 	.
my	 big 	 gest 	 	 challeng 	 e 	 	is	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
it	's	you	and	me	.
my	 big 	 gest 	 	 challeng 	 e 	 	is	your	 block 	 s 	 	to	accept	these	 victim 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	our	own	.
a	 ver 	 y 	 	 support 	 ive 	 	friend	of	mine	,	a	well	-	wisher	of	mine	,	used	to	give	me	every	month	,	2,000	 rupee 	 s 	 	for	 veget 	 able 	 s 	 	.
when	her	mother	fell	sick	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	sunitha	,	you	have	so	much	of	 contact 	 s 	 	.	can	you	get	 some 	 body 	 	in	my	house	to	work	,	so	that	she	can	look	after	my	mother	?	``
and	there	is	a	long	pause	.
and	then	she	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	not	one	of	our	 girl 	 s 	 	.	``
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 fashion 	 able 	 	to	talk	about	human	 traffic 	 king 	 	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	fantastic	a	-	c	hall	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	nice	for	 discuss 	 ion 	 	,	 dis 	 course 	 	,	making	 film 	 s 	 	and	 every 	 thing 	 	.
but	it	is	not	nice	to	 br 	 ing 	 	them	to	our	 home 	 s 	 	.
it	's	not	nice	to	give	them	 employ 	 ment 	 	in	our	 factor 	 ies 	 	,	our	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.
it	's	not	nice	for	our	children	to	 stud 	 y 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	children	.
there	it	 end 	 s 	 	.
that	's	my	 big 	 gest 	 	 challeng 	 e 	 	.
if	i	'm	here	 to 	 day 	 	,	i	'm	here	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	sunitha	krishnan	.
i	'm	here	 a 	 s 	 	a	voice	of	the	 victim 	 s 	 	and	 surviv 	 ors 	 	of	human	 traffic 	 king 	 	.	they	need	your	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
they	need	your	 empath 	 y 	 	.
they	need	,	much	more	than	 any 	 thing 	 	else	,	your	 accept 	 ance 	 	.
 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	when	i	talk	to	people	,	i	keep	 tell 	 ing 	 	them	one	thing	:	do	n't	tell	me	hundred	ways	how	you	can	not	respond	to	 th 	 is 	 	problem	.
can	you	ply	your	mind	for	that	one	way	that	you	can	respond	to	the	problem	?
and	that	's	what	i	'm	here	for	,	 ask 	 ing 	 	for	your	support	,	 demand 	 ing 	 	for	your	support	,	 request 	 ing 	 	for	your	support	.
can	you	break	your	culture	of	silence	?
can	you	speak	to	at	 l 	 east 	 	two	 person 	 s 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	story	?
tell	them	 th 	 is 	 	story	.	 con 	 vince 	 	them	to	tell	the	story	to	 an 	 other 	 	two	 person 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	not	 ask 	 ing 	 	you	all	to	 be 	 come 	 	mahatma	gandhis	or	martin	luther	 king 	 s 	 	,	or	medha	patkars	,	or	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	.	i	'm	 ask 	 ing 	 	you	,	in	your	 limit 	 ed 	 	world	,	can	you	open	your	 mind 	 s 	 	?	can	you	open	your	 heart 	 s 	 	?
can	you	just	 en 	 compass 	 	these	people	too	?
 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	 al 	 so 	 	a	part	of	us	.
they	are	 al 	 so 	 	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	world	.
i	'm	 ask 	 ing 	 	you	,	for	these	children	,	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 face 	 s 	 	you	see	,	they	're	no	more	.
they	 di 	 ed 	 	of	 aid 	 s 	 	last	year	.
i	'm	 ask 	 ing 	 	you	to	help	them	,	accept	 a 	 s 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	--	not	 a 	 s 	 	 philanthro 	 py 	 	,	not	 a 	 s 	 	 char 	 ity 	 	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	who	deserve	all	our	support	.
i	'm	 ask 	 ing 	 	you	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	no	child	,	no	human	 be 	 ing 	 	,	 deserve 	 s 	 	what	these	children	have	gone	through	.
