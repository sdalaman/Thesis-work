i	want	to	talk	to	you	about	one	of	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 myth 	 s 	 	in	medicine	,	and	that	is	the	idea	that	all	we	need	are	more	medical	 break 	 through 	 s 	 	and	then	all	of	our	 problem 	 s 	 	will	be	 solve 	 d 	 	.
our	 socie 	 ty 	 	 love 	 s 	 	to	 romantic 	 ize 	 	the	idea	of	the	single	,	 s 	 olo 	 	inventor	who	,	 work 	 ing 	 	late	in	the	lab	one	night	,	 make 	 s 	 	an	earthshaking	 discover 	 y 	 	,	and	 vo 	 ila 	 	,	 over 	 night 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	's	 change 	 d 	 	.
that	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 appeal 	 ing 	 	picture	,	 how 	 ever 	 	,	it	's	just	not	true	.
in	fact	,	medicine	 to 	 day 	 	is	a	team	 s 	 port 	 	.
and	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	,	it	 al 	 ways 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	.
i	'd	like	to	share	with	you	a	story	about	how	i	've	 experience 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 dramat 	 ically 	 	in	my	own	work	.
i	'm	a	surgeon	,	and	we	 surgeon 	 s 	 	have	 al 	 ways 	 	had	 th 	 is 	 	special	relationship	with	light	.
when	i	make	an	incision	 in 	 side 	 	a	patient	's	body	,	it	's	dark	.
we	need	to	shine	light	to	see	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	why	,	 tradition 	 ally 	 	,	 s 	 urge 	 ries 	 	have	 al 	 ways 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	so	early	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	--	to	take	advantage	of	 day 	 light 	 	 hour 	 s 	 	.
and	if	you	look	at	 historic 	 al 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	of	the	early	 oper 	 ating 	 	rooms	,	they	have	 be 	 en 	 	on	top	of	 building 	 s 	 	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 old 	 est 	 	 oper 	 ating 	 	room	in	the	western	world	,	in	london	,	where	the	 oper 	 ating 	 	room	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	on	top	of	a	church	with	a	skylight	coming	in	.
and	then	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	of	one	of	the	most	famous	 hospital 	 s 	 	in	america	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	mass	general	in	boston	.
and	do	you	know	where	the	 oper 	 ating 	 	room	is	?
here	it	is
on	the	top	of	the	building	with	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	 window 	 s 	 	to	let	light	in	.
so	 now 	 a 	 day 	 s 	 	in	the	 oper 	 ating 	 	room	,	we	no	 long 	 er 	 	need	to	use	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	we	no	 long 	 er 	 	need	to	use	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	,	we	have	 ver 	 y 	 	 special 	 ized 	 	 light 	 s 	 	that	are	made	for	the	 oper 	 ating 	 	room	.
we	have	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	in	other	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 light 	 s 	 	--	 light 	 s 	 	that	can	allow	us	to	see	what	we	 current 	 ly 	 	do	n't	see	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	think	is	the	magic	of	fluorescence	.
so	let	me	back	up	a	little	bit	.
when	we	are	in	medical	school	,	we	learn	our	anatomy	from	 illustr 	 ations 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	where	 every 	 thing 	 	's	color	-	 cod 	 ed 	 	.
 nerve 	 s 	 	are	yellow	,	 arteri 	 es 	 	are	red	,	 vein 	 s 	 	are	blue	.
that	's	so	easy	 any 	 body 	 	could	 be 	 come 	 	a	surgeon	,	right	?
 how 	 ever 	 	,	when	we	have	a	real	patient	on	the	table	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	same	neck	 dis 	 section 	 	--	not	so	easy	to	tell	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	different	 structure 	 s 	 	.
we	heard	over	the	last	couple	 day 	 s 	 	what	an	 urge 	 nt 	 	problem	cancer	still	is	in	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	what	a	 press 	 ing 	 	need	it	is	for	us	to	not	have	one	person	die	every	minute	.
well	if	cancer	can	be	caught	early	,	 en 	 ough 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	that	 some 	 one 	 	can	have	 the 	 ir 	 	cancer	taken	out	,	excised	with	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	,	i	do	n't	care	if	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	gene	or	that	gene	,	or	if	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	protein	or	that	protein	,	it	's	in	the	jar	.
it	's	 d 	 one 	 	,	it	's	out	,	you	're	 cur 	 ed 	 	of	cancer	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	how	we	 ex 	 cise 	 	 cancer 	 s 	 	.
we	do	our	best	,	based	 up 	 on 	 	our	training	and	the	way	the	cancer	 look 	 s 	 	and	the	way	it	 feel 	 s 	 	and	 it 	 s 	 	relationship	to	other	 structure 	 s 	 	and	all	of	our	experience	,	we	say	,	you	know	what	,	the	cancer	's	gone	.
we	've	made	a	good	job	.	we	've	taken	it	out	.
that	's	what	the	surgeon	is	 say 	 ing 	 	in	the	 oper 	 ating 	 	room	when	the	patient	's	on	the	table	.
but	then	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	n't	know	that	it	's	all	out	.
we	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	to	take	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	from	the	 sur 	 gical 	 	bed	,	what	's	left	 be 	 hind 	 	in	the	patient	,	and	then	 s 	 end 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	bits	to	the	 path 	 ology 	 	lab	.
in	the	 mean 	 while 	 	,	the	patient	's	on	the	 oper 	 ating 	 	room	table	.
the	 nurse 	 s 	 	,	 anesthesio 	 logist 	 	,	the	surgeon	,	all	the	 assist 	 ants 	 	are	 wait 	 ing 	 	around	.
and	we	wait	.
the	 patho 	 logist 	 	 take 	 s 	 	that	 s 	 ample 	 	,	 freeze 	 s 	 	it	,	 cut 	 s 	 	it	,	 look 	 s 	 	in	the	 micro 	 scope 	 	one	by	one	and	then	 call 	 s 	 	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	room	.
and	that	may	be	20	 minute 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	per	piece	.
so	if	you	've	 s 	 ent 	 	three	 specimen 	 s 	 	,	it	's	an	hour	 lat 	 er 	 	.
and	 ver 	 y 	 	often	they	say	,	``	you	know	what	,	 point 	 s 	 	a	and	b	are	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	but	point	c	,	you	still	have	some	residual	cancer	there	.
 pleas 	 e 	 	go	cut	that	piece	out	.	``
so	we	go	back	and	we	do	that	 aga 	 in 	 	,	and	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	whole	process	:	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	you	're	 d 	 one 	 	.
we	think	the	entire	tumor	is	out	.	``	but	 ver 	 y 	 	often	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 day 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	the	patient	's	gone	home	,	we	get	a	phone	call	:	``	i	'm	sorry	,
once	we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	final	 path 	 ology 	 	,	once	we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	final	specimen	,	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	found	that	there	's	a	couple	other	 spot 	 s 	 	where	the	 margin 	 s 	 	are	positive	.
there	's	still	cancer	in	your	patient	.	``	so	now	you	're	 face 	 d 	 	with	 tell 	 ing 	 	your	patient	,	first	of	all	,	that	they	may	need	 an 	 other 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	,	or	that	they	need	 add 	 ition 	 al 	 	therapy	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 radi 	 ation 	 	or	 chemo 	 therapy 	 	.
so	would	n't	it	be	better	if	we	could	 re 	 ally 	 	tell	,	if	the	surgeon	could	 re 	 ally 	 	tell	,	 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	there	's	still	cancer	on	the	 sur 	 gical 	 	field	?
i	mean	,	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	,	the	way	that	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	,	we	're	still	 oper 	 ating 	 	in	the	dark	.
so	in	2004	,	 dur 	 ing 	 	my	 sur 	 gical 	 	 re 	 side 	 ncy 	 	,	i	had	the	great	fortune	to	meet	dr.	roger	chen	,	who	went	on	to	win	the	 no 	 bel 	 	prize	for	 chemist 	 ry 	 	in	2008	.
roger	and	his	team	 we 	 re 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	a	way	to	detect	cancer	,	and	they	had	a	 ver 	 y 	 	clever	molecule	that	they	had	come	up	with	.
the	molecule	they	had	 develop 	 ed 	 	had	three	 part 	 s 	 	.
the	main	part	of	it	is	the	blue	part	,	polycation	,	and	it	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 stick 	 y 	 	to	every	tissue	in	your	body	.
so	imagine	that	you	make	a	solution	full	of	 th 	 is 	 	 stick 	 y 	 	material	and	inject	it	 in 	 to 	 	the	 vein 	 s 	 	of	 some 	 one 	 	who	 ha 	 s 	 	cancer	,	 every 	 thing 	 	's	going	to	get	lit	up	.
 noth 	 ing 	 	will	be	specific	.
there	's	no	 specific 	 ity 	 	there	.
so	they	 add 	 ed 	 	two	 add 	 ition 	 al 	 	 component 	 s 	 	.
the	first	one	is	a	polyanionic	segment	,	which	 bas 	 ically 	 	 act 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	non	-	stick	 back 	 ing 	 	like	the	back	of	a	 stick 	 er 	 	.
so	when	 t 	 hose 	 	two	are	together	,	the	molecule	is	neutral	and	 noth 	 ing 	 	 get 	 s 	 	 s 	 tuck 	 	down	.
and	the	two	 piece 	 s 	 	are	then	linked	by	 some 	 thing 	 	that	can	 on 	 ly 	 	be	cut	if	you	have	the	right	 mole 	 cular 	 	 s 	 cis 	 s 	 ors 	 	--	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	the	kind	of	 pro 	 teas 	 e 	 	 enzyme 	 s 	 	that	 tumor 	 s 	 	make	.
so	here	in	 th 	 is 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	if	you	make	a	solution	full	of	 th 	 is 	 	three	-	part	molecule	 a 	 long 	 	with	the	dye	,	which	is	 show 	 n 	 	in	green	,	and	you	inject	it	 in 	 to 	 	the	vein	of	 some 	 one 	 	who	 ha 	 s 	 	cancer	,	normal	tissue	ca	n't	cut	it	.
the	molecule	 pass 	 es 	 	through	and	 get 	 s 	 	excreted	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	in	the	presence	of	the	tumor	,	now	there	are	 mole 	 cular 	 	 s 	 cis 	 s 	 ors 	 	that	can	break	 th 	 is 	 	molecule	 a 	 part 	 	right	there	at	the	cleavable	 s 	 ite 	 	.
and	now	,	boom	,	the	tumor	 label 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	and	it	 get 	 s 	 	fluorescent	.
so	here	's	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	a	nerve	that	 ha 	 s 	 	tumor	 surround 	 ing 	 	it	.
can	you	tell	where	the	tumor	is	?
i	could	n't	when	i	was	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	here	it	is	.	it	's	fluorescent	.
now	it	's	green	.
see	,	so	every	single	one	in	the	audience	now	can	tell	where	the	cancer	is	.
we	can	tell	in	the	 oper 	 ating 	 	room	,	in	the	field	,	at	a	 mole 	 cular 	 	level	,	where	is	the	cancer	and	what	the	surgeon	 need 	 s 	 	to	do	and	how	much	more	work	they	need	to	do	to	cut	that	out	.
and	the	cool	thing	about	fluorescence	is	that	it	's	not	 on 	 ly 	 	bright	,	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	can	shine	through	tissue	.
the	light	that	the	fluorescence	 emit 	 s 	 	can	go	through	tissue	.
so	even	if	the	tumor	is	not	right	on	the	surface	,	you	'll	still	be	able	to	see	it	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	movie	,	you	can	see	that	the	tumor	is	green	.
there	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	normal	muscle	on	top	of	it	.	see	that	?
and	i	'm	 peel 	 ing 	 	that	muscle	away	.
but	even	before	i	peel	that	muscle	away	,	you	saw	that	there	was	a	tumor	 under 	 neath 	 	.
so	that	's	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	tumor	that	's	 label 	 ed 	 	with	fluorescent	 molecule 	 s 	 	.
that	you	can	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	see	the	 margin 	 s 	 	right	there	on	a	 mole 	 cular 	 	level	,	but	you	can	see	it	even	if	it	's	not	right	on	the	top	--	even	if	it	's	beyond	your	field	of	view	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 work 	 s 	 	for	 metasta 	 tic 	 	lymph	 nod 	 es 	 	 al 	 so 	 	.
sentinel	lymph	 no 	 de 	 	 dis 	 section 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 change 	 d 	 	the	way	that	we	manage	breast	cancer	,	melanoma	.
women	used	to	get	 re 	 ally 	 	 debilit 	 ating 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ries 	 	to	 ex 	 cise 	 	all	of	the	 axilla 	 ry 	 	lymph	 nod 	 es 	 	.
but	when	sentinel	lymph	 no 	 de 	 	came	 in 	 to 	 	our	 treat 	 ment 	 	 proto 	 col 	 	,	the	surgeon	 bas 	 ically 	 	 look 	 s 	 	for	the	single	 no 	 de 	 	that	is	the	first	 drain 	 ing 	 	lymph	 no 	 de 	 	of	the	cancer	.
and	then	if	that	 no 	 de 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	cancer	,	the	woman	would	go	on	to	get	the	 axilla 	 ry 	 	lymph	 no 	 de 	 	 dis 	 section 	 	.
so	what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	is	if	the	lymph	 no 	 de 	 	did	not	have	cancer	,	the	woman	would	be	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	from	 hav 	 ing 	 	 un 	 necess 	 ary 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	.
but	sentinel	lymph	 no 	 de 	 	,	the	way	that	we	do	it	 to 	 day 	 	,	is	kind	of	like	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	road	map	just	to	know	where	to	go	.
so	if	you	're	 driv 	 ing 	 	on	the	 free 	 way 	 	and	you	want	to	know	where	's	the	next	gas	station	,	you	have	a	map	to	tell	you	that	that	gas	station	is	down	the	road	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	tell	you	 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	the	gas	station	 ha 	 s 	 	gas	.
you	have	to	cut	it	out	,	 br 	 ing 	 	it	back	home	,	cut	it	up	,	look	 in 	 side 	 	and	say	,	``	oh	 y 	 es 	 	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	have	gas	.	``	so	that	 take 	 s 	 	more	time	.
 patient 	 s 	 	are	still	on	the	 oper 	 ating 	 	room	table	.
anesthesiologists	,	 surgeon 	 s 	 	are	 wait 	 ing 	 	around	.
that	 take 	 s 	 	time	.
so	with	our	technology	,	we	can	tell	right	away	.
you	see	a	lot	of	little	,	 round 	 ish 	 	 bump 	 s 	 	there	.
some	of	these	are	swollen	lymph	 nod 	 es 	 	that	look	a	little	 large 	 r 	 	than	 other 	 s 	 	.
who	 among 	 st 	 	us	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	had	swollen	lymph	 nod 	 es 	 	with	a	cold	?
that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	that	there	's	cancer	 in 	 side 	 	.
well	with	our	technology	,	the	surgeon	is	able	to	tell	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	which	 nod 	 es 	 	have	cancer	.
i	wo	n't	go	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	,	but	our	technology	,	 be 	 side 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	tag	tumor	and	 metasta 	 tic 	 	lymph	 nod 	 es 	 	with	fluorescence	,	we	can	 al 	 so 	 	use	the	same	smart	three	-	part	molecule	to	tag	gadolinium	onto	the	system	so	you	can	do	 th 	 is 	 	noninvasively	.
the	patient	 ha 	 s 	 	cancer	,	you	want	to	know	if	the	lymph	 nod 	 es 	 	have	cancer	even	before	you	go	in	.
well	you	can	see	 th 	 is 	 	on	an	mri	.
so	in	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	,	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	know	what	to	cut	out	.
but	 equal 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	is	to	preserve	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 import 	 ant 	 	for	function	.
so	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	avoid	inadvertent	 in 	 jury 	 	.
and	what	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	are	 nerve 	 s 	 	.
 nerve 	 s 	 	,	if	they	are	 inju 	 red 	 	,	can	cause	 para 	 lysis 	 	,	can	cause	pain	.
in	the	setting	of	 pro 	 state 	 	cancer	,	up	to	60	percent	of	men	after	 pro 	 state 	 	cancer	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	may	have	urinary	incontinence	and	 erect 	 ile 	 	 dis 	 function 	 	.
that	's	a	lot	of	people	to	have	a	lot	of	 problem 	 s 	 	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	even	in	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	nerve	-	 s 	 par 	 ing 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	that	the	surgeon	is	aware	of	the	problem	,	and	they	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	avoid	the	 nerve 	 s 	 	.
but	you	know	what	,	these	little	 nerve 	 s 	 	are	so	small	,	in	the	 con 	 text 	 	of	 pro 	 state 	 	cancer	,	that	they	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	never	 s 	 een 	 	.
they	are	 trac 	 ed 	 	just	by	 the 	 ir 	 	known	 an 	 atomic 	 al 	 	path	 a 	 long 	 	 va 	 s 	 cul 	 ature 	 	.
and	they	're	known	 be 	 cause 	 	 some 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	to	 stud 	 y 	 	them	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	that	we	're	still	 learn 	 ing 	 	about	where	they	are	.
crazy	to	think	that	we	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	,	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 ex 	 cise 	 	cancer	,	we	do	n't	know	where	the	cancer	is	.
we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	preserve	 nerve 	 s 	 	;	we	ca	n't	see	where	they	are	.
so	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	would	n't	it	be	great	if	we	could	find	a	way	to	see	 nerve 	 s 	 	with	fluorescence	?
and	at	first	 th 	 is 	 	did	n't	get	a	lot	of	support	.
people	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	it	 th 	 is 	 	way	for	all	these	 year 	 s 	 	.
what	's	the	problem	?
we	have	n't	had	that	 man 	 y 	 	 complic 	 ations 	 	.	``	but	i	went	 a 	 head 	 	 any 	 way 	 	.
and	roger	 help 	 ed 	 	me	.
and	he	 br 	 ought 	 	his	whole	team	with	him	.
so	there	's	that	 team 	 work 	 	thing	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	we	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	 molecule 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 specific 	 ally 	 	 label 	 ing 	 	 nerve 	 s 	 	.
and	when	we	made	a	solution	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	 tag 	 ged 	 	with	the	fluorescence	and	 inject 	 ed 	 	in	the	body	of	a	mouse	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 nerve 	 s 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	glowed	.
you	can	see	where	they	are	.
here	you	're	looking	at	a	sciatic	nerve	of	a	mouse	,	and	you	can	see	that	that	big	,	fat	 port 	 ion 	 	you	can	see	 ver 	 y 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	.
but	in	fact	,	at	the	tip	of	that	where	i	'm	 dissect 	 ing 	 	now	,	there	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	fine	arborizations	that	ca	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	be	 s 	 een 	 	.
you	see	what	 look 	 s 	 	like	little	medusa	 head 	 s 	 	coming	out	.
we	have	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	see	 nerve 	 s 	 	for	 fa 	 cial 	 	 express 	 ion 	 	,	for	 fa 	 cial 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	,	for	 breath 	 ing 	 	--	every	single	nerve	--	 nerve 	 s 	 	for	urinary	function	around	the	 pro 	 state 	 	.
we	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	see	every	single	nerve	.
when	we	put	these	two	 prob 	 es 	 	together	...
so	here	's	a	tumor	.
do	you	 guy 	 s 	 	know	where	the	 margin 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	tumor	is	?

what	about	the	nerve	that	's	going	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	tumor	?
that	white	 port 	 ion 	 	there	is	easy	to	see	.
but	what	about	the	part	that	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	tumor	?
do	you	know	where	it	's	going	?
now	you	do	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	,	we	've	come	up	with	a	way	to	stain	tissue	and	color	-	code	the	 sur 	 gical 	 	field	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	bit	of	a	 break 	 through 	 	.
i	think	that	it	'll	change	the	way	that	we	do	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	.
we	 publish 	 ed 	 	our	 result 	 s 	 	in	the	 proceed 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	the	national	academy	of	 science 	 s 	 	and	in	nature	 bio 	 technology 	 	.
we	 receiv 	 ed 	 	 comment 	 ary 	 	in	discover	magazine	,	in	the	economist	.
and	we	 show 	 ed 	 	it	to	a	lot	of	my	 sur 	 gical 	 	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	.
they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 w 	 ow 	 	!
i	have	 patient 	 s 	 	who	would	benefit	from	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	think	that	 th 	 is 	 	will	result	in	my	 s 	 urge 	 ries 	 	with	a	better	 out 	 come 	 	and	 few 	 er 	 	 complic 	 ations 	 	.	``	what	 need 	 s 	 	to	happen	now	is	further	 develop 	 ment 	 	of	our	technology	 a 	 long 	 	with	 develop 	 ment 	 	of	the	 instrument 	 ation 	 	that	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	see	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	fluorescence	in	the	 oper 	 ating 	 	room	.
the	 event 	 ual 	 	goal	is	that	we	'll	get	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 patient 	 s 	 	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	we	've	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	there	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	no	 straight 	 forward 	 	 mechan 	 ism 	 	to	develop	a	molecule	for	one	-	time	use	.
 understand 	 ably 	 	,	the	 major 	 ity 	 	of	the	medical	industry	is	focused	on	 multi 	 ple 	 	-	use	 drug 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	long	-	term	 dai 	 ly 	 	 medic 	 ations 	 	.
we	are	focused	on	making	 th 	 is 	 	technology	better	.
we	're	focused	on	 add 	 ing 	 	 drug 	 s 	 	,	 add 	 ing 	 	growth	 factor 	 s 	 	,	 kill 	 ing 	 	 nerve 	 s 	 	that	are	 caus 	 ing 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	and	not	the	 surround 	 ing 	 	tissue	.
we	know	that	 th 	 is 	 	can	be	 d 	 one 	 	and	we	're	 commit 	 ted 	 	to	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
i	'd	like	to	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	 th 	 is 	 	final	thought	.
 success 	 ful 	 	 innov 	 ation 	 	is	not	a	single	 break 	 through 	 	.
it	is	not	a	 s 	 print 	 	.
it	is	not	an	event	for	the	 s 	 olo 	 	runner	.
 success 	 ful 	 	 innov 	 ation 	 	is	a	team	 s 	 port 	 	,	it	's	a	 re 	 lay 	 	race	.
it	 requir 	 es 	 	one	team	for	the	 break 	 through 	 	and	 an 	 other 	 	team	to	get	the	 break 	 through 	 	 accept 	 ed 	 	and	 adopt 	 ed 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 take 	 s 	 	the	long	-	term	 stead 	 y 	 	courage	of	the	day	-	in	day	-	out	struggle	to	 educ 	 ate 	 	,	to	 persuad 	 e 	 	and	to	win	 accept 	 ance 	 	.
and	that	is	the	light	that	i	want	to	shine	on	health	and	medicine	 to 	 day 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
