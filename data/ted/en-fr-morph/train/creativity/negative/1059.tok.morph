the	world	is	changing	with	 re 	 ally 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	speed	.
if	you	look	at	the	chart	at	the	top	here	,	you	'll	see	that	in	2025	,	these	goldman	sachs	 project 	 ions 	 	suggest	that	the	chinese	 eco 	 nomy 	 	will	be	 al 	 most 	 	the	same	 s 	 ize 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	american	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
and	if	you	look	at	the	chart	for	2050	,	it	's	 project 	 ed 	 	that	the	chinese	 eco 	 nomy 	 	will	be	twice	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	american	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	and	the	indian	 eco 	 nomy 	 	will	be	 al 	 most 	 	the	same	 s 	 ize 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	american	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
and	we	should	bear	in	mind	here	that	these	 project 	 ions 	 	 we 	 re 	 	drawn	up	before	the	western	financial	crisis	.
a	couple	of	 week 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	was	looking	at	the	 lat 	 est 	 	 project 	 ion 	 	by	bnp	paribas	for	when	 chin 	 a 	 	will	have	a	 large 	 r 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	than	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
goldman	sachs	 project 	 ed 	 	2027	.
the	post	-	crisis	 project 	 ion 	 	is	2020	.
that	's	just	a	decade	away	.
 chin 	 a 	 	is	going	to	change	the	world	in	two	fundamental	 respect 	 s 	 	.
first	of	all	,	it	's	a	huge	 develop 	 ing 	 	country	with	a	population	of	1.3	billion	people	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	growing	for	over	30	 year 	 s 	 	at	around	10	percent	a	year	.
and	 with 	 in 	 	a	decade	,	it	will	have	the	largest	 eco 	 nomy 	 	in	the	world	.
never	before	in	the	modern	era	 ha 	 s 	 	the	largest	 eco 	 nomy 	 	in	the	world	 be 	 en 	 	that	of	a	 develop 	 ing 	 	country	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	a	 develop 	 ed 	 	country	.
 second 	 ly 	 	,	for	the	first	time	in	the	modern	era	,	the	 domin 	 ant 	 	country	in	the	world	--	which	i	think	is	what	 chin 	 a 	 	will	 be 	 come 	 	--	will	be	not	from	the	west	and	from	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	different	 civil 	 ization 	 al 	 	 root 	 s 	 	.
now	,	i	know	it	's	a	 wide 	 spread 	 	assumption	in	the	west	that	 a 	 s 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	 modern 	 ize 	 	,	they	 al 	 so 	 	 western 	 ize 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	illusion	.
it	's	an	assumption	that	 modern 	 ity 	 	is	a	product	 simpl 	 y 	 	of	 com 	 petition 	 	,	 market 	 s 	 	and	technology	.
it	is	not	.	it	is	 al 	 so 	 	shaped	 equal 	 ly 	 	by	 histo 	 ry 	 	and	culture	.
 chin 	 a 	 	is	not	like	the	west	,	and	it	will	not	 be 	 come 	 	like	the	west	.
it	will	remain	in	 ver 	 y 	 	fundamental	 respect 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	different	.
now	the	big	question	here	is	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	how	do	we	make	sense	of	 chin 	 a 	 	?
how	do	we	try	to	understand	what	 chin 	 a 	 	is	?
and	the	problem	we	have	in	the	west	at	the	moment	,	by	and	large	,	is	that	the	 convention 	 al 	 	approach	is	that	we	understand	it	 re 	 ally 	 	in	western	 term 	 s 	 	,	using	western	 idea 	 s 	 	.
we	ca	n't	.
now	i	want	to	 off 	 er 	 	you	three	building	 block 	 s 	 	for	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	what	 chin 	 a 	 	is	like	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	a	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
the	first	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	that	 chin 	 a 	 	is	not	 re 	 ally 	 	a	nation	-	state	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	 it 	 self 	 	a	nation	-	state	for	the	last	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	,	but	 every 	 one 	 	who	 know 	 s 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	about	 chin 	 a 	 	 know 	 s 	 	it	's	a	lot	 old 	 er 	 	than	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	what	 chin 	 a 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	like	with	the	 vict 	 ory 	 	of	the	qin	 dy 	 nasty 	 	in	221	b.c	.	at	the	end	of	the	 war 	 ring 	 	-	state	period	--
the	birth	of	modern	 chin 	 a 	 	.
and	you	can	see	it	against	the	 bound 	 aries 	 	of	modern	 chin 	 a 	 	.
or	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	 after 	 ward 	 	,	the	han	 dy 	 nasty 	 	,	still	2,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	you	can	see	 al 	 ready 	 	it	 occu 	 pies 	 	most	of	what	we	now	know	 a 	 s 	 	eastern	 chin 	 a 	 	,	which	is	where	the	vast	 major 	 ity 	 	of	chinese	lived	then	and	live	now	.
now	what	is	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	what	 give 	 s 	 	 chin 	 a 	 	 it 	 s 	 	sense	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 chin 	 a 	 	,	what	 give 	 s 	 	the	chinese	the	sense	of	what	it	is	to	be	chinese	,	 come 	 s 	 	not	from	the	last	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	,	not	from	the	nation	-	state	period	,	which	is	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	west	,	but	from	the	period	,	if	you	like	,	of	the	 civil 	 ization 	 	-	state	.
i	'm	 think 	 ing 	 	here	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	of	 custom 	 s 	 	like	 ance 	 stral 	 	worship	,	of	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 distinct 	 ive 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	of	the	state	,	 like 	 wise 	 	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 distinct 	 ive 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	of	the	family	,	social	 relationship 	 s 	 	like	guanxi	,	confucian	 value 	 s 	 	and	so	on	.
these	are	all	 thing 	 s 	 	that	come	from	the	period	of	the	 civil 	 ization 	 	-	state	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	 chin 	 a 	 	,	 un 	 like 	 	the	western	 state 	 s 	 	and	most	 count 	 ries 	 	in	the	world	,	is	shaped	by	 it 	 s 	 	sense	of	 civil 	 ization 	 	,	 it 	 s 	 	 exist 	 ence 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 civil 	 ization 	 	-	state	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 a 	 s 	 	a	nation	-	state	.
and	there	's	one	other	thing	to	add	to	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	that	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	of	course	we	know	 chin 	 a 	 	's	big	,	huge	,	 demo 	 graphical 	 ly 	 	and	 geo 	 graphical 	 ly 	 	,	with	a	population	of	1.3	billion	people	.
what	we	often	are	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	aware	of	is	the	fact	that	 chin 	 a 	 	is	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 divers 	 e 	 	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 plural 	 istic 	 	,	and	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	 ver 	 y 	 	 de 	 central 	 ized 	 	.
you	ca	n't	run	a	place	on	 th 	 is 	 	scale	 simpl 	 y 	 	from	beijing	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	we	think	 th 	 is 	 	to	be	the	case	.
it	's	never	 be 	 en 	 	the	case	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 chin 	 a 	 	,	a	 civil 	 ization 	 	-	state	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	a	nation	-	state	.
and	what	 do 	 es 	 	it	mean	?
well	,	i	think	it	 ha 	 s 	 	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 pro 	 found 	 	 implic 	 ations 	 	.
i	'll	give	you	two	quick	 one 	 s 	 	.
the	first	is	that	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 politic 	 al 	 	value	for	the	chinese	is	 un 	 ity 	 	,	is	the	maintenance	of	chinese	 civil 	 ization 	 	.
you	know	,	2,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	europe	:	 break 	 down 	 	--	the	 fragment 	 ation 	 	of	the	holy	roman	empire	.
it	 divid 	 ed 	 	,	and	it	's	 remain 	 ed 	 	 divid 	 ed 	 	ever	since	.
 chin 	 a 	 	,	over	the	same	time	period	,	went	in	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	direction	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 pain 	 fully 	 	 hold 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	huge	 civil 	 ization 	 	,	 civil 	 ization 	 	-	state	,	together	.
the	second	is	 may 	 be 	 	more	prosaic	,	which	is	hong	kong	.
do	you	remember	the	 hand 	 over 	 	of	hong	kong	by	britain	to	 chin 	 a 	 	in	1997	?
you	may	remember	what	the	chinese	 constit 	 ution 	 al 	 	 pro 	 position 	 	was	.	one	country	,	two	 system 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'll	lay	a	 wage 	 r 	 	that	 bare 	 ly 	 	 any 	 one 	 	in	the	west	 believ 	 ed 	 	them	.
``	window	 dress 	 ing 	 	.
when	 chin 	 a 	 	 get 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	on	hong	kong	,	that	wo	n't	be	the	case	.	``	thirteen	 year 	 s 	 	on	,	the	 politic 	 al 	 	and	legal	system	in	hong	kong	is	 a 	 s 	 	different	now	 a 	 s 	 	it	was	in	1997	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	wrong	.	why	 we 	 re 	 	we	wrong	?
we	 we 	 re 	 	wrong	 be 	 cause 	 	we	thought	,	 natural 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	in	nation	-	state	ways	.
think	of	german	 un 	 ification 	 	,	1990	.
what	 happen 	 ed 	 	?
well	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	the	east	was	 swallow 	 ed 	 	by	the	west	.
one	nation	,	one	system	.
that	is	the	nation	-	state	 ment 	 ality 	 	.
but	you	ca	n't	run	a	country	like	 chin 	 a 	 	,	a	 civil 	 ization 	 	-	state	,	on	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	one	 civil 	 ization 	 	,	one	system	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	.
so	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	 respons 	 e 	 	of	 chin 	 a 	 	to	the	question	of	hong	kong	--	 a 	 s 	 	it	will	be	to	the	question	of	taiwan	--	was	a	natural	 respons 	 e 	 	:	one	 civil 	 ization 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 system 	 s 	 	.
let	me	 off 	 er 	 	you	 an 	 other 	 	building	block	to	try	and	understand	 chin 	 a 	 	--	 may 	 be 	 	not	sort	of	a	 comfort 	 able 	 	one	.
the	chinese	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	different	conception	of	race	to	most	other	 count 	 ries 	 	.
do	you	know	,	of	the	1.3	billion	chinese	,	over	90	percent	of	them	think	they	belong	to	the	same	race	,	the	han	?
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	from	the	world	's	[	other	]	most	 popu 	 lous 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	.
india	,	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	indonesia	,	brazil	--	all	of	them	are	 multi 	 racial 	 	.
the	chinese	do	n't	feel	like	that	.
 chin 	 a 	 	is	 on 	 ly 	 	 multi 	 racial 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	at	the	 margin 	 s 	 	.
so	the	question	is	,	why	?
well	the	reason	,	i	think	,	 essential 	 ly 	 	is	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	back	to	the	 civil 	 ization 	 	-	state	.
a	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	at	 l 	 east 	 	2,000	 year 	 s 	 	,	a	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 con 	 quest 	 	,	occupation	,	absorption	,	 a 	 s 	 simil 	 ation 	 	and	so	on	,
led	to	the	process	by	which	,	over	time	,	 th 	 is 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	of	the	han	 emerge 	 d 	 	--	of	course	,	 nurture 	 d 	 	by	a	growing	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	sense	of	cultural	 ident 	 ity 	 	.
now	the	great	advantage	of	 th 	 is 	 	 historic 	 al 	 	experience	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	that	,	 with 	 out 	 	the	han	,	 chin 	 a 	 	could	never	have	held	together	.
the	han	 ident 	 ity 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	the	cement	which	 ha 	 s 	 	held	 th 	 is 	 	country	together	.
the	great	 dis 	 advantage 	 	of	it	is	that	the	han	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	weak	conception	of	cultural	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
they	 re 	 ally 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 super 	 ior 	 ity 	 	,	and	they	are	 dis 	 respect 	 ful 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	who	are	not	.
 h 	 ence 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	attitude	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	to	the	uyghurs	and	to	the	tibetans	.
or	let	me	give	you	my	third	building	block	,	the	chinese	state	.
now	the	relationship	between	the	state	and	 socie 	 ty 	 	in	 chin 	 a 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	different	from	that	in	the	west	.
now	we	in	the	west	 overwhelm 	 ing 	 ly 	 	seem	to	think	--	in	these	 day 	 s 	 	at	 l 	 east 	 	--	that	the	 author 	 ity 	 	and	 leg 	 i 	 timacy 	 	of	the	state	is	a	function	of	 demo 	 cracy 	 	.
the	problem	with	 th 	 is 	 	 pro 	 position 	 	is	that	the	chinese	state	 enjoy 	 s 	 	more	 leg 	 i 	 timacy 	 	and	more	 author 	 ity 	 	 among 	 st 	 	the	chinese	than	is	true	with	any	western	state	.
and	the	reason	for	 th 	 is 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	--
well	,	there	are	two	 reason 	 s 	 	,	i	think	.
and	it	's	 obvious 	 ly 	 	got	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	 demo 	 cracy 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	in	our	 term 	 s 	 	the	chinese	 certain 	 ly 	 	do	n't	have	a	 demo 	 cracy 	 	.
and	the	reason	for	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	 first 	 ly 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	state	in	 chin 	 a 	 	is	 give 	 n 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	special	--	it	 enjoy 	 s 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	special	 sign 	 ific 	 ance 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 represent 	 ative 	 	,	the	 embodi 	 ment 	 	and	the	 guard 	 ian 	 	of	chinese	 civil 	 ization 	 	,	of	the	 civil 	 ization 	 	-	state	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 a 	 s 	 	close	 a 	 s 	 	 chin 	 a 	 	 get 	 s 	 	to	a	kind	of	spiritual	role	.
and	the	second	reason	is	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	in	europe	and	north	america	,	the	state	's	power	is	 continu 	 ously 	 	 challeng 	 ed 	 	--	i	mean	in	the	european	tradition	,	 historic 	 ally 	 	against	the	church	,	against	other	 sector 	 s 	 	of	the	 aristoc 	 racy 	 	,	against	 merchan 	 ts 	 	and	so	on	--	for	1,000	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	power	of	the	chinese	state	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 be 	 en 	 	 challeng 	 ed 	 	.
it	's	had	no	serious	 rival 	 s 	 	.
so	you	can	see	that	the	way	in	which	power	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 construct 	 ed 	 	in	 chin 	 a 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	different	from	our	experience	in	western	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
the	result	,	by	the	way	,	is	that	the	chinese	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	view	of	the	state	.
 where 	 a 	 s 	 	we	tend	to	view	it	 a 	 s 	 	an	 intrud 	 er 	 	,	a	 strange 	 r 	 	,	 certain 	 ly 	 	an	organ	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 power 	 s 	 	need	to	be	 limit 	 ed 	 	or	defined	and	 con 	 s 	 trained 	 	,	the	chinese	do	n't	see	the	state	like	that	at	all	.
the	chinese	view	the	state	 a 	 s 	 	an	 intima 	 te 	 	--	not	just	 a 	 s 	 	an	 intima 	 te 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	member	of	the	family	--	not	just	in	fact	 a 	 s 	 	a	member	of	the	family	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	the	head	of	the	family	,	the	patriarch	of	the	family	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	chinese	view	of	the	state	--	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	different	to	 our 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	in	 socie 	 ty 	 	in	a	different	kind	of	way	to	what	is	the	case	in	the	west	.
and	i	would	suggest	to	you	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	what	we	are	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	here	,	in	the	chinese	 con 	 text 	 	,	is	a	new	kind	of	paradigm	,	which	is	different	from	 any 	 thing 	 	we	've	had	to	think	about	in	the	past	.
know	that	 chin 	 a 	 	 believ 	 es 	 	in	the	market	and	the	state	.
i	mean	,	adam	smith	,	 al 	 ready 	 	writing	in	the	late	18th	century	,	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	the	chinese	market	is	 large 	 r 	 	and	more	 develop 	 ed 	 	and	more	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	than	 any 	 thing 	 	in	europe	.	``	and	,	 a 	 part 	 	from	the	mao	period	,	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 remain 	 ed 	 	more	or	less	the	case	ever	since	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	 combine 	 d 	 	with	an	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	strong	and	 ubiqu 	 it 	 ous 	 	state	.
the	state	is	 every 	 where 	 	in	 chin 	 a 	 	.	i	mean	,	it	's	 lead 	 ing 	 	 firm 	 s 	 	--	 man 	 y 	 	of	them	are	still	 public 	 ly 	 	owned	.	private	 firm 	 s 	 	,	 how 	 ever 	 	large	they	are	,	like	lenovo	,	depend	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	on	state	 patron 	 age 	 	.	 target 	 s 	 	for	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	and	so	on
are	set	by	the	state	.
and	the	state	,	of	course	,	 it 	 s 	 	 author 	 ity 	 	 flow 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	other	 area 	 s 	 	--
 a 	 s 	 	we	are	familiar	with	--	with	 some 	 thing 	 	like	the	one	-	child	policy	.
 more 	 over 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	old	state	tradition	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	old	tradition	of	 state 	 craft 	 	.
i	mean	,	if	you	want	an	 illustr 	 ation 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	the	great	wall	is	one	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	grand	 can 	 al 	 	,	which	was	 construct 	 ed 	 	in	the	first	 in 	 stance 	 	in	the	fifth	century	b.c	.
and	was	 final 	 ly 	 	 complete 	 d 	 	in	the	 seven 	 th 	 	century	a.d	.
it	went	for	1,114	 mile 	 s 	 	,	 link 	 ing 	 	beijing	with	hangzhou	and	shanghai	.
so	there	's	a	long	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	state	 infra 	 structural 	 	 project 	 s 	 	in	 chin 	 a 	 	,	which	i	suppose	 help 	 s 	 	us	to	explain	what	we	see	 to 	 day 	 	,	which	is	 some 	 thing 	 	like	the	three	gorges	dam	and	 man 	 y 	 	other	 express 	 ions 	 	of	state	 compete 	 nce 	 	 with 	 in 	 	 chin 	 a 	 	.
so	there	we	have	three	building	 block 	 s 	 	for	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	that	is	 chin 	 a 	 	--	the	 civil 	 ization 	 	-	state	,	the	 not 	 ion 	 	of	race	and	the	nature	of	the	state	and	 it 	 s 	 	relationship	to	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
and	yet	we	still	insist	,	by	and	large	,	in	 think 	 ing 	 	that	we	can	understand	 chin 	 a 	 	by	 simpl 	 y 	 	 draw 	 ing 	 	on	western	experience	,	looking	at	it	through	western	 eye 	 s 	 	,	using	western	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	.
if	you	want	to	know	why	we	 un 	 er 	 ring 	 ly 	 	seem	to	get	 chin 	 a 	 	wrong	--	our	 predict 	 ions 	 	about	what	's	going	to	happen	to	 chin 	 a 	 	are	 in 	 correct 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	reason	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	i	think	,	i	have	to	say	that	i	think	attitude	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 chin 	 a 	 	is	that	of	a	kind	of	little	westerner	 ment 	 ality 	 	.
it	's	kind	of	 arrog 	 ant 	 	.
it	's	 arrog 	 ant 	 	in	the	sense	that	we	think	that	we	are	best	,	and	 there 	 fore 	 	we	have	the	universal	measure	.
and	 second 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	 ignor 	 ant 	 	.
we	 re 	 fuse 	 	to	 re 	 ally 	 	address	the	issue	of	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
you	know	,	there	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 pass 	 age 	 	in	a	book	by	paul	cohen	,	the	american	historian	.
and	paul	cohen	 argu 	 es 	 	that	the	west	 think 	 s 	 	of	 it 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	most	 cosmo 	 politan 	 	of	all	 culture 	 s 	 	.
but	it	's	not	.
in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	,	it	's	the	most	parochial	,	 be 	 cause 	 	for	200	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	west	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	so	 domin 	 ant 	 	in	the	world	that	it	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	to	understand	other	 culture 	 s 	 	,	other	 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	at	the	end	of	the	day	,	it	could	,	if	 necess 	 ary 	 	by	force	,	get	 it 	 s 	 	own	way	.
 where 	 a 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 culture 	 s 	 	--	 virtual 	 ly 	 	the	rest	of	the	world	,	in	fact	,	which	have	 be 	 en 	 	in	a	far	 weak 	 er 	 	position	,	vis	-	a	-	vis	the	west	--	have	 be 	 en 	 	 there 	 by 	 	 force 	 d 	 	to	understand	the	west	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	west	's	presence	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	.
and	 there 	 fore 	 	,	they	are	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	,	more	 cosmo 	 politan 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	than	the	west	.
i	mean	,	take	the	question	of	east	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	.	east	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	:	japan	,	korea	,	 chin 	 a 	 	,	etc	.	--	a	third	of	the	world	's	population	 live 	 s 	 	there	.	now	the	largest	economic	region	in	the	world	.
and	i	'll	tell	you	now	,	that	east	asianers	,	people	from	east	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	,	are	far	more	 knowledge 	 able 	 	about	the	west	than	the	west	is	about	east	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	point	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 germ 	 ane 	 	,	i	'm	 af 	 raid 	 	,	to	the	present	.
 be 	 cause 	 	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	?	back	to	that	chart	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	the	goldman	sachs	chart	.
what	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	is	that	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	in	 historic 	 al 	 	 term 	 s 	 	,	the	world	is	 be 	 ing 	 	driven	and	shaped	,	not	by	the	old	 develop 	 ed 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	but	by	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	.
we	've	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	g	20	 usurp 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	the	position	of	the	g	7	,	or	the	g	8	.
and	there	are	two	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
first	,	the	west	is	 rapid 	 ly 	 	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	influence	in	the	world	.
there	was	a	 dramat 	 ic 	 	 illustr 	 ation 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	year	ago	--	copenhagen	,	climate	change	 con 	 ference 	 	.
europe	was	not	at	the	final	 negoti 	 ating 	 	table	.
when	did	that	last	happen	?
i	would	 wage 	 r 	 	it	was	 prob 	 ably 	 	about	200	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	that	is	what	is	going	to	happen	in	the	future	.
and	the	second	 implic 	 ation 	 	is	that	the	world	will	 inevit 	 ably 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 con 	 sequence 	 	,	 be 	 come 	 	 increasing 	 ly 	 	 un 	 familiar 	 	to	us	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	'll	be	shaped	by	 culture 	 s 	 	and	 experience 	 s 	 	and	 histo 	 ries 	 	that	we	are	not	 re 	 ally 	 	familiar	with	,	or	 con 	 ver 	 s 	 ant 	 	with	.
and	at	last	,	i	'm	 af 	 raid 	 	--	take	europe	;	america	is	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	different	--	but	europeans	by	and	large	,	i	have	to	say	,	are	 ignor 	 ant 	 	,	are	 un 	 aware 	 	about	the	way	the	world	is	changing	.
some	people	--	i	've	got	an	english	friend	in	 chin 	 a 	 	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	the	continent	is	 sleep 	 walk 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 obliv 	 ion 	 	.	``	well	,	 may 	 be 	 	that	's	true	,	 may 	 be 	 	that	's	an	 exagge 	 ration 	 	.
but	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	problem	which	 go 	 es 	 	 a 	 long 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	--	that	europe	is	 increasing 	 ly 	 	out	of	touch	with	the	world	--	and	that	is	a	sort	of	loss	of	a	sense	of	the	future	.
i	mean	,	europe	once	,	of	course	,	once	 command 	 ed 	 	the	future	in	 it 	 s 	 	confidence	.
take	the	19th	century	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	,	 ala 	 s 	 	,	is	no	 long 	 er 	 	true	.
if	you	want	to	feel	the	future	,	if	you	want	to	taste	the	future	,	try	 chin 	 a 	 	--	there	's	old	confucius	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 rail 	 way 	 	station	the	 like 	 s 	 	of	which	you	've	never	 s 	 een 	 	before	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	even	look	like	a	 rail 	 way 	 	station	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	new	guangzhou	 rail 	 way 	 	station	for	the	high	-	speed	 train 	 s 	 	.
 chin 	 a 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 big 	 ger 	 	network	than	any	other	country	in	the	world	and	will	soon	have	more	than	all	the	rest	of	the	world	put	together	.
or	take	 th 	 is 	 	:	now	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	idea	,	but	it	's	an	idea	to	be	 tri 	 ed 	 	out	 short 	 ly 	 	in	a	suburb	of	beijing	.
here	you	have	a	 mega 	 bus 	 	,	on	the	upper	deck	 car 	 ries 	 	about	2,000	people	.
it	 travel 	 s 	 	on	 rail 	 s 	 	down	a	 sub 	 urban 	 	road	,	and	the	 car 	 s 	 	travel	 under 	 neath 	 	it	.
and	it	 do 	 es 	 	 speed 	 s 	 	of	up	to	about	100	 mile 	 s 	 	an	hour	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	way	 thing 	 s 	 	are	going	to	move	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 chin 	 a 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	specific	problem	,	which	is	different	from	europe	and	different	from	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	:
 chin 	 a 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	huge	 number 	 s 	 	of	people	and	no	space	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	solution	to	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	where	 chin 	 a 	 	's	going	to	have	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	cities	over	20	million	people	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	how	would	i	like	to	finish	?	well	,	what	should	our	attitude	be	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	world	that	we	see	 ver 	 y 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	 develop 	 ing 	 	before	us	?
i	think	there	will	be	good	 thing 	 s 	 	about	it	and	there	will	be	bad	 thing 	 s 	 	about	it	.
but	i	want	to	 argu 	 e 	 	,	above	all	,	a	big	-	picture	positive	for	 th 	 is 	 	world	.
for	200	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	world	was	 essential 	 ly 	 	 govern 	 ed 	 	by	a	fragment	of	the	human	population	.
that	's	what	europe	and	north	america	 represent 	 ed 	 	.
the	 arriv 	 al 	 	of	 count 	 ries 	 	like	 chin 	 a 	 	and	india	--	between	them	38	percent	of	the	world	's	population	--	and	 other 	 s 	 	like	indonesia	and	brazil	and	so	on	,
represent	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	single	act	of	 democrat 	 ization 	 	in	the	last	200	 year 	 s 	 	.
 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	and	 culture 	 s 	 	,	which	had	 be 	 en 	 	 ignor 	 ed 	 	,	which	had	no	voice	,	which	 we 	 re 	 	not	 listen 	 ed 	 	to	,	which	 we 	 re 	 	not	known	about	,	will	have	a	different	sort	of	 represent 	 ation 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	world	.
 a 	 s 	 	 human 	 ists 	 	,	we	must	welcome	,	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 transform 	 ation 	 	,
and	we	will	have	to	learn	about	these	 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	big	ship	here	was	the	one	 s 	 ailed 	 	in	by	zheng	he	in	the	early	15th	century	on	his	great	 voyage 	 s 	 	around	the	south	 chin 	 a 	 	sea	,	the	east	 chin 	 a 	 	sea	and	 a 	 cross 	 	the	indian	ocean	to	east	africa	.
the	little	boat	in	front	of	it	was	the	one	in	which	,	80	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	christopher	columbus	 cross 	 ed 	 	the	atlantic	.
or	,	look	 care 	 fully 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	silk	scroll	made	by	zhuzhou	in	1368	.
i	think	they	're	 play 	 ing 	 	golf	.
christ	,	the	chinese	even	 invent 	 ed 	 	golf	.
welcome	to	the	future	.	thank	you	.
