let	's	just	start	by	looking	at	some	great	 photograph 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	icon	of	national	 geo 	 graphic 	 	,	an	afghan	 refuge 	 e 	 	taken	by	steve	mccurry	.
but	the	harvard	lampoon	is	about	to	come	out	with	a	 paro 	 dy 	 	of	national	 geo 	 graphic 	 	,	and	i	shudder	to	think	what	they	're	going	to	do	to	 th 	 is 	 	photograph	.
oh	,	the	wrath	of	photoshop	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	jet	 land 	 ing 	 	at	san	francisco	,	by	bruce	dale	.

here	's	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
four	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	was	at	the	beach	with	my	son	,	and	he	was	 learn 	 ing 	 	how	to	swim	in	 th 	 is 	 	 relat 	 ively 	 	soft	surf	of	the	delaware	 beach 	 es 	 	.
but	i	 turn 	 ed 	 	away	for	a	moment	,	and	he	got	caught	 in 	 to 	 	a	 rip 	 tide 	 	and	 start 	 ed 	 	to	be	 pull 	 ed 	 	out	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	 jet 	 ty 	 	.
i	can	stand	here	right	now	and	see	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	go	 tear 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	water	after	him	,	the	 moment 	 s 	 	 s 	 low 	 ing 	 	down	and	freezing	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 arrange 	 ment 	 	.
i	can	see	the	 rock 	 s 	 	are	over	here	.
there	's	a	wave	about	to	crash	onto	him	.
i	can	see	his	 hand 	 s 	 	 reach 	 ing 	 	out	,	and	i	can	see	his	face	in	terror	,	looking	at	me	,	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	help	me	,	dad	.	``
i	got	him	.	the	wave	broke	over	us	.
we	got	back	on	shore	;	he	was	fine	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	a	little	bit	 rattle 	 d 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	 flash 	 bulb 	 	 memor 	 y 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	,	is	when	all	the	 element 	 s 	 	came	together	to	define	not	just	the	event	,	but	my	 emotion 	 al 	 	 connect 	 ion 	 	to	it	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	a	photograph	 tap 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	when	it	 make 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	own	 power 	 ful 	 	 connect 	 ion 	 	to	a	 view 	 er 	 	.
now	i	have	to	tell	you	,	i	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	kyle	last	week	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	that	i	was	going	to	tell	 th 	 is 	 	story	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	oh	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	i	remember	that	too	!
i	remember	my	image	of	you	was	that	you	 we 	 re 	 	up	on	the	shore	 yell 	 ing 	 	at	me	.	``	i	thought	i	was	a	hero	.
so	,
 th 	 is 	 	 represent 	 s 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	cross	-	 s 	 ample 	 	of	some	 remark 	 able 	 	 image 	 s 	 	taken	by	some	of	the	world	's	 great 	 est 	 	 photo 	 journalist 	 s 	 	,	 work 	 ing 	 	at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	top	of	 the 	 ir 	 	craft	--
 ex 	 cept 	 	one	.
 th 	 is 	 	photograph	was	taken	by	dr.	euan	mason	in	new	zealand	last	year	,	and	it	was	 submit 	 ted 	 	and	 publish 	 ed 	 	in	national	 geo 	 graphic 	 	.
last	year	,	we	 add 	 ed 	 	a	section	to	our	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	``	your	shot	,	``	where	 any 	 one 	 	can	submit	 photograph 	 s 	 	for	possible	 public 	 ation 	 	.
and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	a	wild	success	,	 tap 	 ping 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	enthusiast	 photograph 	 y 	 	community	.
the	quality	of	these	amateur	 photograph 	 s 	 	can	,	at	 time 	 s 	 	,	be	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
and	 see 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 reinforce 	 s 	 	,	for	me	,	that	every	one	of	us	 ha 	 s 	 	at	 l 	 east 	 	one	or	two	great	 photograph 	 s 	 	in	them	.
but	to	be	a	great	 photo 	 journalist 	 	,	you	have	to	have	more	than	just	one	or	two	great	 photograph 	 s 	 	in	you	.
you	've	got	to	be	able	to	make	them	all	the	time	.
but	even	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	you	need	to	know	how	to	create	a	visual	narrative	.
you	need	to	know	how	to	tell	a	story	.
so	i	'm	going	to	share	with	you	some	 cover 	 age 	 s 	 	that	i	feel	 demonst 	 rate 	 	the	 story 	 tell 	 ing 	 	power	of	 photograph 	 y 	 	.
 photograph 	 er 	 	nick	nichols	went	to	document	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	and	 relat 	 ively 	 	 un 	 known 	 	 wild 	 life 	 	 sanct 	 uary 	 	in	chad	,	 call 	 ed 	 	zakouma	.
the	original	intent	was	to	travel	there	and	 br 	 ing 	 	back	a	classic	story	of	 divers 	 e 	 	species	,	of	an	 ex 	 otic 	 	 local 	 e 	 	.
and	that	is	what	nick	did	,	up	to	a	point	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 serv 	 al 	 	cat	.
he	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	taking	his	own	picture	,	shot	with	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	a	camera	trap	.	there	's	an	 infra 	 red 	 	beam	that	's	going	 a 	 cross 	 	,	and	he	 ha 	 s 	 	 steppe 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	beam	and	taken	his	photograph	.
these	are	 baboon 	 s 	 	at	a	 water 	 ing 	 	hole	.
nick	--	the	camera	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	an	 autom 	 atic 	 	camera	took	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 picture 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	nick	 end 	 ed 	 	up	with	a	lot	of	 picture 	 s 	 	of	the	rear	 end 	 s 	 	of	 baboon 	 s 	 	.
a	lion	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	late	night	snack	--	notice	he	's	got	a	broken	tooth	.
and	a	crocodile	 walk 	 s 	 	up	a	 river 	 bank 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	 it 	 s 	 	den	.
i	love	 th 	 is 	 	little	bit	of	water	that	 come 	 s 	 	off	the	back	of	his	tail	.
but	the	 center 	 piece 	 	species	of	zakouma	are	the	 elephant 	 s 	 	.
it	's	one	of	the	largest	 in 	 tact 	 	 herd 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	part	of	africa	.
here	's	a	photograph	shot	in	 moon 	 light 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	digital	 photograph 	 y 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	made	a	big	 differ 	 ence 	 	for	.
it	was	with	the	 elephant 	 s 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	story	 pivot 	 ed 	 	.
nick	,	 a 	 long 	 	with	 research 	 er 	 	dr.	michael	fay	,	 collar 	 ed 	 	the	 ma 	 tri 	 arch 	 	of	the	herd	.
they	named	her	annie	,
and	they	 beg 	 an 	 	 track 	 ing 	 	her	 move 	 ments 	 	.
the	herd	was	safe	 with 	 in 	 	the	 con 	 fine 	 s 	 	of	the	park	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 dedicate 	 d 	 	group	of	park	 rang 	 ers 	 	.
but	once	the	annual	 rain 	 s 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	,	the	herd	would	begin	 migr 	 ating 	 	to	 feed 	 ing 	 	 ground 	 s 	 	 out 	 side 	 	the	park	.
and	that	's	when	they	ran	 in 	 to 	 	trouble	.
for	 out 	 side 	 	the	 safe 	 ty 	 	of	the	park	 we 	 re 	 	 poacher 	 s 	 	,	who	would	hunt	them	down	 on 	 ly 	 	for	the	value	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 iv 	 ory 	 	 tusk 	 s 	 	.
the	 ma 	 tri 	 arch 	 	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	radio	 track 	 ing 	 	,	after	 week 	 s 	 	of	moving	back	and	forth	,	in	and	out	of	the	park	,	came	to	a	halt	 out 	 side 	 	the	park	.
annie	had	 be 	 en 	 	 kill 	 ed 	 	,	 a 	 long 	 	with	20	 member 	 s 	 	of	her	herd	.
and	they	 on 	 ly 	 	came	for	the	 iv 	 ory 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	one	of	the	 rang 	 ers 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	chase	off	one	of	the	 poacher 	 s 	 	and	 re 	 cover 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 iv 	 ory 	 	,
 be 	 cause 	 	they	could	n't	 leav 	 e 	 	it	there	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	still	 valu 	 able 	 	.
but	what	nick	did	was	he	 br 	 ought 	 	back	a	story	that	went	beyond	the	old	-	school	method	of	just	straight	,	``	is	n't	 th 	 is 	 	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	world	?	``
and	 in 	 stead 	 	,	 create 	 d 	 	a	story	that	 touch 	 ed 	 	our	 audience 	 s 	 	 deep 	 ly 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	just	knowledge	of	 th 	 is 	 	park	,	he	 create 	 d 	 	an	 understand 	 ing 	 	and	an	 empath 	 y 	 	for	the	 elephant 	 s 	 	,	the	 rang 	 ers 	 	and	the	 man 	 y 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	 surround 	 ing 	 	human	-	 wild 	 life 	 	 conflict 	 s 	 	.
now	let	's	go	over	to	india	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	you	can	tell	a	broad	story	in	a	focused	way	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	looking	at	the	same	issue	that	richard	wurman	 touch 	 es 	 	 up 	 on 	 	in	his	new	world	population	project	.
for	the	first	time	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	more	people	live	in	urban	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 r 	 ural 	 	,	 environment 	 s 	 	.
and	most	of	that	growth	is	not	in	the	cities	,
but	in	the	 s 	 lum 	 s 	 	that	surround	them	.
jonas	bendiksen	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 energ 	 etic 	 	 photograph 	 er 	 	,	came	to	me	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	need	to	document	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	here	's	my	proposal	.	let	's	go	all	over	the	world	and	photograph	every	single	 s 	 lum 	 	around	the	world	.	``	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	you	know	,	that	might	be	a	bit	 ambit 	 ious 	 	for	our	budget	.	``	so	 in 	 stead 	 	,	what	we	did	was	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	going	out	and	 do 	 ing 	 	what	would	result	in	what	we	'd	consider	sort	of	a	survey	story	--	where	you	just	go	in	and	see	just	a	little	bit	of	 every 	 thing 	 	--	we	put	jonas	 in 	 to 	 	dharavi	,	which	is	part	of	mumbai	,	india	,	and	let	him	stay	there	,	and	 re 	 ally 	 	get	 in 	 to 	 	the	heart	and	soul	of	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	major	part	of	the	city	.
what	jonas	did	was	not	just	go	and	do	a	surface	look	at	the	awful	 condition 	 s 	 	that	exist	in	 s 	 uch 	 	 place 	 s 	 	.
he	saw	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	living	and	 breath 	 ing 	 	and	vital	part	of	how	the	entire	urban	area	 function 	 ed 	 	.
by	 stay 	 ing 	 	 tight 	 ly 	 	focused	in	one	place	,	jonas	 ta 	 pped 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	soul	and	the	 endur 	 ing 	 	human	spirit	that	 under 	 lies 	 	 th 	 is 	 	community	.
and	he	did	it	in	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	way	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	to	tell	a	story	is	with	a	 s 	 weep 	 ing 	 	picture	.
we	 team 	 ed 	 	up	 under 	 water 	 	 photograph 	 er 	 	brian	skerry	and	 photo 	 journalist 	 	randy	olson	to	document	the	 deple 	 tion 	 	of	the	world	's	 fish 	 eries 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	n't	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 one 	 s 	 	to	tackle	 th 	 is 	 	subject	,	but	the	 photograph 	 s 	 	that	brian	and	randy	 create 	 d 	 	are	among	the	best	to	capture	both	the	human	and	natural	 deva 	 station 	 	of	 over 	 fish 	 ing 	 	.

she	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	--	it	's	a	shame	you	ca	n't	see	it	in	the	photograph	,	but	she	's	12	feet	long	.
so	,	she	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	significant	in	 s 	 ize 	 	.
and	paul	 s 	 aid 	 	he	was	never	 re 	 ally 	 	 af 	 raid 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	she	was	more	 cur 	 ious 	 	about	him	than	 threaten 	 ed 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 mouth 	 ing 	 	behavior	,	on	the	right	,	was	 re 	 ally 	 	her	way	of	 say 	 ing 	 	to	him	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	look	how	big	i	am	!	``
or	you	know	,	``	my	,	what	big	 tee 	 th 	 	you	have	.	``
then	paul	 think 	 s 	 	that	she	 simpl 	 y 	 	took	 p 	 ity 	 	on	him	.
to	her	,	here	was	 th 	 is 	 	big	,	 goof 	 y 	 	creature	in	the	water	that	for	some	reason	did	n't	seem	to	be	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	chasing	 penguin 	 s 	 	.
so	what	she	did	was	she	 start 	 ed 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	 penguin 	 s 	 	to	him	,	 al 	 ive 	 	,	and	put	them	in	front	of	him	.
she	 drop 	 ped 	 	them	off	,	and	then	they	would	swim	away	.
she	'd	kind	of	look	at	him	,	like	``	what	are	you	 do 	 ing 	 	?	``
go	back	and	get	them	,	and	then	 br 	 ing 	 	them	back	and	drop	them	in	front	of	him	.
and	she	did	 th 	 is 	 	over	the	course	of	a	couple	of	 day 	 s 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	the	point	where	she	got	so	 frust 	 rated 	 	with	him	that	she	 start 	 ed 	 	 put 	 ting 	 	them	 direct 	 ly 	 	on	top	of	his	head	.
which	just	 result 	 ed 	 	in	a	fantastic	photograph	.
 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	paul	 think 	 s 	 	that	she	just	 figur 	 ed 	 	that	he	was	never	going	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	her	just	 puff 	 ing 	 	out	,	you	know	,	 s 	 nor 	 ting 	 	out	in	disgust	.
and	lost	interest	with	him	,	and	went	back	to	what	she	 do 	 es 	 	best	.
paul	set	out	to	photograph	a	 relat 	 ively 	 	 myster 	 ious 	 	and	 un 	 known 	 	creature	,	and	came	back	with	not	just	a	 collect 	 ion 	 	of	 photograph 	 s 	 	,	but	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	experience	and	a	great	story	.
it	is	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 st 	 ories 	 	,	 one 	 s 	 	that	go	beyond	the	 im 	 mediate 	 	or	just	the	 super 	 ficial 	 	that	 demonst 	 rate 	 	the	power	of	 photo 	 journal 	 ism 	 	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 photograph 	 y 	 	can	make	a	real	 connect 	 ion 	 	to	people	,	and	can	be	 employ 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	positive	agent	for	 understand 	 ing 	 	the	 challeng 	 es 	 	and	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	facing	our	world	 to 	 day 	 	.
thank	you	.
