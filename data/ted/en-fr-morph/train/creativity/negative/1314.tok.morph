there	's	a	poem	written	by	a	 ver 	 y 	 	famous	english	poet	at	the	end	of	the	19th	century	.
it	was	 s 	 aid 	 	to	echo	in	churchill	's	brain	in	the	1930s	.
and	the	poem	 go 	 es 	 	:	``	on	the	 idl 	 e 	 	hill	of	summer	,	 laz 	 y 	 	with	the	flow	of	 stream 	 s 	 	,	hark	i	hear	a	 di 	 stant 	 	 drum 	 mer 	 	,	 drum 	 ming 	 	like	a	sound	in	 dream 	 s 	 	,	far	and	near	and	low	and	 loud 	 er 	 	on	the	 road 	 s 	 	of	earth	go	by	,	dear	to	friend	and	food	to	powder	,	 soldier 	 s 	 	 march 	 ing 	 	,	soon	to	die	.	``
 t 	 hose 	 	who	are	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 poet 	 ry 	 	,	the	poem	is	``	a	shropshire	lad	``	written	by	a.e	.	housman	.
but	what	housman	 under 	 stood 	 	,	and	you	hear	it	in	the	 sym 	 phon 	 ies 	 	of	nielsen	too	,	was	that	the	long	,	hot	,	 s 	 il 	 van 	 	 summer 	 s 	 	of	 st 	 ability 	 	of	the	19th	century	 we 	 re 	 	coming	to	a	close	,	and	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	about	to	move	 in 	 to 	 	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 terrify 	 ing 	 	 period 	 s 	 	of	 histo 	 ry 	 	when	power	 change 	 s 	 	.
and	these	are	 al 	 ways 	 	 period 	 s 	 	,	 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	 accompani 	 ed 	 	by	 turbul 	 ence 	 	,	and	all	too	often	by	blood	.
and	my	 mess 	 age 	 	for	you	is	that	i	 believ 	 e 	 	we	are	 condemn 	 ed 	 	,	if	you	like	,	to	live	at	just	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 moment 	 s 	 	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	when	the	gimbals	 up 	 on 	 	which	the	 establish 	 ed 	 	order	of	power	is	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	change	and	the	new	look	of	the	world	,	the	new	 power 	 s 	 	that	exist	in	the	world	,	are	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	take	form	.
and	these	are	--	and	we	see	it	 ver 	 y 	 	 clear 	 ly 	 	 to 	 day 	 	--	 near 	 ly 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 high 	 ly 	 	 turbul 	 ent 	 	 time 	 s 	 	,	 high 	 ly 	 	difficult	 time 	 s 	 	,	and	all	too	often	 ver 	 y 	 	 blood 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	.
by	the	way	,	it	 happen 	 s 	 	about	once	every	century	.
you	might	 argu 	 e 	 	that	the	last	time	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	--	and	that	's	what	housman	felt	coming	and	what	churchill	felt	too	--	was	that	when	power	 pass 	 ed 	 	from	the	old	 nation 	 s 	 	,	the	old	 power 	 s 	 	of	europe	,	 a 	 cross 	 	the	atlantic	to	the	new	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	power	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	of	america	--	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	american	century	.
and	of	course	,	 in 	 to 	 	the	vacuum	where	the	too	-	old	european	 power 	 s 	 	used	to	be	 we 	 re 	 	 play 	 ed 	 	the	two	 blood 	 y 	 	 catastroph 	 es 	 	of	the	last	century	--	the	one	in	the	first	part	and	the	one	in	the	second	part	:	the	two	great	world	 war 	 s 	 	.
mao	zedong	used	to	refer	to	them	 a 	 s 	 	the	european	civil	 war 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	a	more	accurate	way	of	 de 	 s 	 crib 	 ing 	 	them	.
well	,	 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	we	live	at	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 time 	 s 	 	.
but	for	us	,	i	want	to	talk	about	three	 factor 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	the	first	of	these	,	the	first	two	of	these	,	is	about	a	shift	in	power	.
and	the	second	is	about	some	new	dimension	which	i	want	to	refer	to	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	never	 quit 	 e 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	way	it	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	now	.
but	let	's	talk	about	the	 shift 	 s 	 	of	power	that	are	 occur 	 ring 	 	to	the	world	.
and	what	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	 to 	 day 	 	is	,	in	one	sense	,	 frighten 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	never	 happen 	 ed 	 	before	.
we	have	 s 	 een 	 	lateral	 shift 	 s 	 	of	power	--	the	power	of	greece	 pass 	 ed 	 	to	rome	and	the	power	 shift 	 s 	 	that	 occur 	 red 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	european	 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	--	but	we	are	 see 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	different	.
for	power	is	not	just	moving	 lateral 	 ly 	 	from	nation	to	nation	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	moving	 vert 	 ically 	 	.
what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	 to 	 day 	 	is	that	the	power	that	was	 en 	 case 	 d 	 	,	held	to	 account 	 ability 	 	,	held	to	the	rule	of	law	,	 with 	 in 	 	the	institution	of	the	nation	state	 ha 	 s 	 	now	 migr 	 ated 	 	in	 ver 	 y 	 	large	measure	onto	the	global	stage	.
the	 global 	 ization 	 	of	power	--	we	talk	about	the	 global 	 ization 	 	of	 market 	 s 	 	,	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	it	's	the	 global 	 ization 	 	of	real	power	.
and	where	,	at	the	nation	state	level	that	power	is	held	to	 account 	 ability 	 	subject	to	the	rule	of	law	,	on	the	 inter 	 national 	 	stage	it	is	not	.
the	 inter 	 national 	 	stage	and	the	global	stage	where	power	now	 re 	 side 	 s 	 	:	the	power	of	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	the	power	of	the	satellite	 broad 	 cast 	 ers 	 	,	the	power	of	the	money	 changer 	 s 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	vast	money	-	go	-	round	that	 circul 	 ates 	 	now	32	 time 	 s 	 	the	amount	of	money	 necess 	 ary 	 	for	the	trade	it	's	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	there	to	finance	--	the	money	 changer 	 s 	 	,	if	you	like	,	the	financial	 specul 	 ators 	 	that	have	 br 	 ought 	 	us	all	to	our	 knee 	 s 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	the	power	of	the	 multi 	 national 	 	 corporation 	 s 	 	now	 develop 	 ing 	 	 budget 	 s 	 	often	 big 	 ger 	 	than	medium	-	sized	 count 	 ries 	 	.
these	live	in	a	global	space	which	is	 large 	 ly 	 	 un 	 regulat 	 ed 	 	,	not	subject	to	the	rule	of	law	,	and	in	which	people	may	act	free	of	constraint	.
now	that	 suit 	 s 	 	the	 power 	 ful 	 	up	to	a	moment	.
it	's	 al 	 ways 	 	 suit 	 able 	 	for	 t 	 hose 	 	who	have	the	most	power	to	 oper 	 ate 	 	in	 space 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	constraint	,	but	the	 less 	 on 	 	of	 histo 	 ry 	 	is	that	,	 soon 	 er 	 	or	 lat 	 er 	 	,	 un 	 regulat 	 ed 	 	space	--	space	not	subject	to	the	rule	of	law	--	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 populate 	 d 	 	,	not	just	by	the	 thing 	 s 	 	you	 want 	 ed 	 	--	 inter 	 national 	 	trade	,	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	etc	.	--	but	 al 	 so 	 	by	the	 thing 	 s 	 	you	do	n't	want	--	 inter 	 national 	 	 criminal 	 ity 	 	,	 inter 	 national 	 	 terror 	 ism 	 	.
the	 revel 	 ation 	 	of	9/11	is	that	even	if	you	are	the	most	 power 	 ful 	 	nation	on	earth	,	 never 	 the 	 less 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	who	inhabit	that	space	can	attack	you	even	in	your	most	 icon 	 ic 	 	of	cities	one	bright	september	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	 s 	 aid 	 	that	 some 	 thing 	 	like	60	percent	of	the	four	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	that	was	taken	to	fund	9/11	 actual 	 ly 	 	 pass 	 ed 	 	through	the	 institution 	 s 	 	of	the	 t 	 win 	 	 tower 	 s 	 	which	9/11	 destroy 	 ed 	 	.
you	see	,	our	 ene 	 mies 	 	 al 	 so 	 	use	 th 	 is 	 	space	--	the	space	of	mass	travel	,	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	satellite	 broad 	 cast 	 ers 	 	--	to	be	able	to	get	around	 the 	 ir 	 	poison	,	which	is	about	 destroy 	 ing 	 	our	 system 	 s 	 	and	our	ways	.
 soon 	 er 	 	or	 lat 	 er 	 	,	 soon 	 er 	 	or	 lat 	 er 	 	,	the	rule	of	 histo 	 ry 	 	is	that	where	power	 go 	 es 	 	 govern 	 ance 	 	must	follow	.
and	if	it	is	 there 	 fore 	 	the	case	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 believ 	 e 	 	it	is	,	that	one	of	the	 phenomen 	 on 	 	of	our	time	is	the	 global 	 ization 	 	of	power	,	then	it	 follow 	 s 	 	that	one	of	the	 challeng 	 es 	 	of	our	time	is	to	 br 	 ing 	 	 govern 	 ance 	 	to	the	global	space	.
and	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	the	 decade 	 s 	 	 a 	 head 	 	of	us	now	will	be	to	a	 great 	 er 	 	or	 less 	 er 	 	 ex 	 tent 	 	 turbul 	 ent 	 	the	more	or	less	we	are	able	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	that	aim	:	to	 br 	 ing 	 	 govern 	 ance 	 	to	the	global	space	.
now	notice	,	i	'm	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	government	.
i	'm	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	setting	up	some	global	 democrat 	 ic 	 	institution	.
my	own	view	,	by	the	way	,	 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	 un 	 like 	 ly 	 	to	be	 d 	 one 	 	by	 spawn 	 ing 	 	more	u.n.	 institution 	 s 	 	.
if	we	did	n't	have	the	u.n.	,	we	'd	have	to	invent	it	.
the	world	 need 	 s 	 	an	 inter 	 national 	 	forum	.
it	 need 	 s 	 	a	 mean 	 s 	 	by	which	you	can	legitimize	 inter 	 national 	 	action	.
but	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	 govern 	 ance 	 	of	the	global	space	,	my	guess	is	 th 	 is 	 	wo	n't	happen	through	the	creation	of	more	u.n.	 institution 	 s 	 	.
it	will	 actual 	 ly 	 	happen	by	the	 power 	 ful 	 	coming	together	and	making	 treat 	 y 	 	-	based	 system 	 s 	 	,	 treat 	 y 	 	-	based	 agree 	 ments 	 	,	to	govern	that	global	space	.
and	if	you	look	,	you	can	see	them	 happen 	 ing 	 	,	 al 	 ready 	 	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	emerge	.
the	world	trade	 organ 	 ization 	 	:	 treat 	 y 	 	-	based	 organ 	 ization 	 	,	 entire 	 ly 	 	 treat 	 y 	 	-	based	,	and	yet	,	 power 	 ful 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	to	hold	even	the	most	 power 	 ful 	 	,	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	to	account	if	 necess 	 ary 	 	.
kyoto	:	the	 begin 	 ning 	 s 	 	of	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	to	create	a	 treat 	 y 	 	-	based	 organ 	 ization 	 	.
the	g	20	:	we	know	now	that	we	have	to	put	together	an	institution	which	is	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	 govern 	 ance 	 	to	that	financial	space	for	financial	 specul 	 ation 	 	.
and	that	's	what	the	g	20	is	,	a	 treat 	 y 	 	-	based	institution	.
now	there	's	a	problem	there	,	and	we	'll	come	back	to	it	in	a	minute	,	which	is	that	if	you	 br 	 ing 	 	the	most	 power 	 ful 	 	together	to	make	the	 rule 	 s 	 	in	 treat 	 y 	 	-	based	 institution 	 s 	 	,	to	fill	that	 govern 	 ance 	 	space	,	then	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	the	weak	who	are	left	out	?
and	that	's	a	big	problem	,	and	we	'll	return	to	it	in	just	a	second	.
so	there	's	my	first	 mess 	 age 	 	,	that	if	you	are	to	pass	through	these	 turbul 	 ent 	 	 time 	 s 	 	more	or	less	 turbul 	 ent 	 ly 	 	,	then	our	success	in	 do 	 ing 	 	that	will	in	large	measure	depend	on	our	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	 sens 	 ible 	 	 govern 	 ance 	 	to	the	global	space	.
and	watch	that	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	happen	.
my	second	point	is	,	and	i	know	i	do	n't	have	to	talk	to	an	audience	like	 th 	 is 	 	about	 s 	 uch 	 	a	thing	,	but	power	is	not	just	shifting	 vert 	 ically 	 	,	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	shifting	 horizon 	 t 	 ally 	 	.
you	might	 argu 	 e 	 	that	the	story	,	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	 gather 	 ed 	 	around	 sea 	 s 	 	--	with	the	first	 one 	 s 	 	around	the	mediterranean	,	the	more	 re 	 cent 	 	 one 	 s 	 	in	the	 ascend 	 ent 	 s 	 	of	western	power	around	the	atlantic	.
well	it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	that	we	're	now	 see 	 ing 	 	a	fundamental	shift	of	power	,	 broad 	 ly 	 	 s 	 peaking 	 	,	away	from	 nation 	 s 	 	 gather 	 ed 	 	around	the	atlantic	[	 sea 	 board 	 	]	to	the	 nation 	 s 	 	 gather 	 ed 	 	around	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	rim	.
now	that	 begin 	 s 	 	with	economic	power	,	but	that	's	the	way	it	 al 	 ways 	 	 begin 	 s 	 	.
you	 al 	 ready 	 	begin	to	see	the	 develop 	 ment 	 	of	foreign	 poli 	 cies 	 	,	the	 augment 	 ation 	 	of	 militar 	 y 	 	 budget 	 s 	 	 occur 	 ring 	 	in	the	other	growing	 power 	 s 	 	in	the	world	.
i	think	 actual 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	so	much	a	shift	from	the	west	to	the	east	;	 some 	 thing 	 	different	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
my	guess	is	,	for	what	it	's	worth	,	is	that	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	will	remain	the	most	 power 	 ful 	 	nation	on	earth	for	the	next	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	15	,	but	the	 con 	 text 	 	in	which	she	 hold 	 s 	 	her	power	 ha 	 s 	 	now	 radical 	 ly 	 	 alter 	 ed 	 	;	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 radical 	 ly 	 	 change 	 d 	 	.
we	are	coming	out	of	50	 year 	 s 	 	,	most	 un 	 usual 	 	 year 	 s 	 	,	of	 histo 	 ry 	 	in	which	we	have	had	a	 total 	 ly 	 	mono	-	polar	world	,	in	which	every	compass	needle	for	or	against	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 re 	 ference 	 d 	 	by	 it 	 s 	 	position	to	washington	--	a	world	 be 	 stro 	 de 	 	by	a	single	colossus	.
but	that	's	not	a	usual	case	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
in	fact	,	what	's	now	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	is	the	much	more	normal	case	of	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
you	're	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	see	the	emergence	of	a	multi	-	polar	world	.
up	 un 	 til 	 	now	,	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	the	 domin 	 ant 	 	feature	of	our	world	.
they	will	remain	the	most	 power 	 ful 	 	nation	,	but	they	will	be	the	most	 power 	 ful 	 	nation	in	an	 increasing 	 ly 	 	multi	-	polar	world	.
and	you	begin	to	see	the	 alter 	 native 	 	 center 	 s 	 	of	power	building	up	--	in	 chin 	 a 	 	,	of	course	,	 th 	 ough 	 	my	own	guess	is	that	 chin 	 a 	 	's	 a 	 s 	 cent 	 	to	 great 	 ness 	 	is	not	smooth	.
it	's	going	to	be	 quit 	 e 	 	 grum 	 py 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 chin 	 a 	 	 begin 	 s 	 	to	 democrat 	 ize 	 	her	 socie 	 ty 	 	after	 liberal 	 izing 	 	her	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
but	that	's	a	subject	of	a	different	 discuss 	 ion 	 	.
you	see	india	,	you	see	brazil	.
you	see	 increasing 	 ly 	 	that	the	world	now	 look 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	for	us	europeans	,	much	more	like	europe	in	the	19th	century	.
europe	in	the	19th	century	:	a	great	british	foreign	 secret 	 ary 	 	,	lord	canning	,	used	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	the	``	european	concert	of	 power 	 s 	 	.	``
there	was	a	balance	,	a	five	-	sided	balance	.
britain	 al 	 ways 	 	 play 	 ed 	 	to	the	balance	.
if	paris	got	together	with	berlin	,	britain	got	together	with	vienna	and	rome	to	provide	a	 counter 	 balance 	 	.
now	notice	,	in	a	period	which	is	 dominate 	 d 	 	by	a	mono	-	polar	world	,	you	have	 fix 	 ed 	 	 alliance 	 s 	 	--	nato	,	the	warsaw	pact	.
a	 fix 	 ed 	 	 polar 	 ity 	 	of	power	 mean 	 s 	 	 fix 	 ed 	 	 alliance 	 s 	 	.
but	a	 multi 	 ple 	 	 polar 	 ity 	 	of	power	 mean 	 s 	 	shifting	and	changing	 alliance 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	the	world	we	're	coming	 in 	 to 	 	,	in	which	we	will	 increasing 	 ly 	 	see	that	our	 alliance 	 s 	 	are	not	 fix 	 ed 	 	.
canning	,	the	great	british	foreign	 secret 	 ary 	 	once	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	britain	 ha 	 s 	 	a	common	interest	,	but	no	common	 al 	 lies 	 	.	``
and	we	will	see	 increasing 	 ly 	 	that	even	we	in	the	west	will	reach	out	,	have	to	reach	out	,	beyond	the	cozy	circle	of	the	atlantic	 power 	 s 	 	to	make	 alliance 	 s 	 	with	 other 	 s 	 	if	we	want	to	get	 thing 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	in	the	world	.
note	,	that	when	we	went	 in 	 to 	 	libya	,	it	was	not	good	 en 	 ough 	 	for	the	west	to	do	it	 al 	 one 	 	;	we	had	to	 br 	 ing 	 	 other 	 s 	 	in	.
we	had	to	 br 	 ing 	 	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	the	arab	league	in	.
my	guess	is	 ir 	 aq 	 	and	afghanistan	are	the	last	 time 	 s 	 	when	the	west	 ha 	 s 	 	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	do	it	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	and	we	have	n't	 succeed 	 ed 	 	.
my	guess	is	that	we	're	 reach 	 ing 	 	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	end	of	400	 year 	 s 	 	--	i	say	400	 year 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	the	end	of	the	ottoman	empire	--	of	the	 hegemon 	 y 	 	of	western	power	,	western	 institution 	 s 	 	and	western	 value 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	up	 un 	 til 	 	now	,	if	the	west	got	 it 	 s 	 	act	together	,	it	could	 pro 	 pose 	 	and	 dispos 	 e 	 	in	every	corner	of	the	world	.
but	that	's	no	 long 	 er 	 	true	.
take	the	last	financial	crisis	after	the	second	world	war	.
the	west	got	together	--	the	bretton	 wood 	 s 	 	institution	,	world	bank	,	 inter 	 national 	 	 mon 	 et 	 ary 	 	fund	--	the	problem	 solve 	 d 	 	.
now	we	have	to	call	in	 other 	 s 	 	.
now	we	have	to	create	the	g	20	.
now	we	have	to	reach	beyond	the	cozy	circle	of	our	western	 friend 	 s 	 	.
let	me	make	a	 predict 	 ion 	 	for	you	,	which	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	even	more	 start 	 ling 	 	.
i	suspect	we	are	now	 reach 	 ing 	 	the	end	of	400	 year 	 s 	 	when	western	power	was	 en 	 ough 	 	.

we	are	all	now	 deep 	 ly 	 	,	 deep 	 ly 	 	,	 deep 	 ly 	 	 interconnect 	 ed 	 	.
and	what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	is	the	idea	of	a	nation	state	 act 	 ing 	 	 al 	 one 	 	,	not	 connect 	 ed 	 	with	 other 	 s 	 	,	not	 work 	 ing 	 	with	 other 	 s 	 	,	is	no	 long 	 er 	 	a	 vi 	 able 	 	 pro 	 position 	 	.

i	was	a	young	soldier	in	the	last	of	the	small	empire	 war 	 s 	 	of	britain	.
at	that	time	,	the	defense	of	my	country	was	about	one	thing	and	one	thing	 on 	 ly 	 	:	how	strong	was	our	 arm 	 y 	 	,	how	strong	was	our	air	force	,	how	strong	was	our	 nav 	 y 	 	and	how	strong	 we 	 re 	 	our	 al 	 lies 	 	.
that	was	when	the	 ene 	 my 	 	was	 out 	 side 	 	the	 wall 	 s 	 	.
now	the	 ene 	 my 	 	is	 in 	 side 	 	the	 wall 	 s 	 	.
now	if	i	want	to	talk	about	the	defense	of	my	country	,	i	have	to	speak	to	the	 mini 	 ster 	 	of	health	 be 	 cause 	 	 pan 	 demic 	 	disease	is	a	threat	to	my	security	,	i	have	to	speak	to	the	 mini 	 ster 	 	of	 agricultur 	 e 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	food	security	is	a	threat	to	my	security	,	i	have	to	speak	to	the	 mini 	 ster 	 	of	industry	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 f 	 rag 	 ility 	 	of	our	hi	-	tech	 infra 	 structure 	 	is	now	a	point	of	attack	for	our	 ene 	 mies 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	we	see	from	cyber	 war 	 fare 	 	--	i	have	to	speak	to	the	 mini 	 ster 	 	of	home	 af 	 fair 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	who	 ha 	 s 	 	 enter 	 ed 	 	my	country	,	who	 live 	 s 	 	in	that	terraced	house	in	that	inner	city	 ha 	 s 	 	a	direct	effect	on	what	 happen 	 s 	 	in	my	country	--	 a 	 s 	 	we	in	london	saw	in	the	7/7	 bomb 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
it	's	no	 long 	 er 	 	the	case	that	the	security	of	a	country	is	 simpl 	 y 	 	a	matter	for	 it 	 s 	 	 soldier 	 s 	 	and	 it 	 s 	 	 mini 	 stry 	 	of	defense	.
it	's	 it 	 s 	 	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	lock	together	 it 	 s 	 	 institution 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	you	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
it	 tell 	 s 	 	you	that	,	in	fact	,	our	 government 	 s 	 	,	 vert 	 ically 	 	 construct 	 ed 	 	,	 construct 	 ed 	 	on	the	economic	model	of	the	industrial	revolution	--	 vert 	 ical 	 	 hierarch 	 y 	 	,	 special 	 ization 	 	of	 task 	 s 	 	,	command	 structure 	 s 	 	--	have	got	the	wrong	 structure 	 s 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	.
you	in	business	know	that	the	paradigm	structure	of	our	time	,	 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	is	the	network	.
it	's	your	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	network	that	 matter 	 s 	 	,	both	 with 	 in 	 	your	 government 	 s 	 	and	 external 	 ly 	 	.
so	here	is	ashdown	's	third	law	.
by	the	way	,	do	n't	ask	me	about	ashdown	's	first	law	and	second	law	 be 	 cause 	 	i	have	n't	 invent 	 ed 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	yet	;	it	 al 	 ways 	 	 sound 	 s 	 	better	if	there	's	a	third	law	,	 do 	 es 	 	n't	it	?
ashdown	's	third	law	is	that	in	the	modern	age	,	where	 every 	 thing 	 	is	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	 every 	 thing 	 	,	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	about	what	you	can	do	is	what	you	can	do	with	 other 	 s 	 	.
the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	bit	about	your	structure	--	 whet 	 her 	 	you	're	a	government	,	 whet 	 her 	 	you	're	an	 arm 	 y 	 	 regimen 	 t 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	you	're	a	business	--	is	your	 dock 	 ing 	 	 point 	 s 	 	,	your	 interconnect 	 ors 	 	,	your	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	network	with	 other 	 s 	 	.
you	understand	that	in	industry	;	 government 	 s 	 	do	n't	.
but	now	one	final	thing	.
if	it	is	the	case	,	 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	--	and	it	is	--	that	we	are	now	 lock 	 ed 	 	together	in	a	way	that	 ha 	 s 	 	never	 be 	 en 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	the	same	before	,	then	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	the	case	that	we	share	a	 de 	 s 	 tin 	 y 	 	with	each	other	.
 sudden 	 ly 	 	and	for	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	time	,	 collect 	 ive 	 	defense	,	the	thing	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 dominate 	 d 	 	us	 a 	 s 	 	the	 con 	 cept 	 	of	 secu 	 ring 	 	our	 nation 	 s 	 	,	is	no	 long 	 er 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	.
it	used	to	be	the	case	that	if	my	tribe	was	more	 power 	 ful 	 	than	 the 	 ir 	 	tribe	,	i	was	safe	;	if	my	country	was	more	 power 	 ful 	 	than	 the 	 ir 	 	country	,	i	was	safe	;	my	alliance	,	like	nato	,	was	more	 power 	 ful 	 	than	 the 	 ir 	 	alliance	,	i	was	safe	.
it	is	no	 long 	 er 	 	the	case	.
the	 ad 	 vent 	 	of	the	 interconnect 	 ed 	 ness 	 	and	of	the	 weapon 	 s 	 	of	mass	 destruct 	 ion 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	,	 increasing 	 ly 	 	,	i	share	a	 de 	 s 	 tin 	 y 	 	with	my	 ene 	 my 	 	.
when	i	was	a	diplomat	 negoti 	 ating 	 	the	 dis 	 armament 	 	 treat 	 ies 	 	with	the	soviet	 un 	 ion 	 	in	geneva	in	the	1970s	,	we	 succeed 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 under 	 stood 	 	we	 share 	 d 	 	a	 de 	 s 	 tin 	 y 	 	with	them	.
 collect 	 ive 	 	security	is	not	 en 	 ough 	 	.
peace	 ha 	 s 	 	come	to	 north 	 ern 	 	ireland	 be 	 cause 	 	both	 side 	 s 	 	 real 	 ized 	 	that	the	zero	-	sum	game	could	n't	work	.
they	 share 	 d 	 	a	 de 	 s 	 tin 	 y 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 ene 	 mies 	 	.
one	of	the	great	 bar 	 rier 	 s 	 	to	peace	in	the	middle	east	is	that	both	 side 	 s 	 	,	both	israel	and	,	i	think	,	the	palestinians	,	do	not	understand	that	they	share	a	 collect 	 ive 	 	 de 	 s 	 tin 	 y 	 	.
and	so	 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	what	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	the	 pro 	 position 	 	of	 vision 	 aries 	 	and	 poet 	 s 	 	down	the	 age 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	we	have	to	take	 serious 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	matter	of	public	policy	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	with	a	poem	,	i	'll	end	with	one	.
the	great	poem	of	john	donne	's	.
``	 s 	 end 	 	not	for	whom	the	bell	 toll 	 s 	 	.	``
the	poem	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	no	man	is	an	 is 	 land 	 	.	``
and	it	 go 	 es 	 	:	``	every	man	's	death	 affect 	 ed 	 	me	,	for	i	am	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 man 	 kind 	 	,	 s 	 end 	 	not	to	ask	for	whom	the	bell	 toll 	 s 	 	,	it	 toll 	 s 	 	for	 the 	 e 	 	.	``
for	john	donne	,	a	 recommend 	 ation 	 	of	 moral 	 ity 	 	.
for	us	,	i	think	,	part	of	the	 equ 	 ation 	 	for	our	 surviv 	 al 	 	.
