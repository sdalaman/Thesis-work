 be 	 cause 	 	i	 usual 	 ly 	 	take	the	role	of	 try 	 ing 	 	to	explain	to	people	how	 wonder 	 ful 	 	the	new	 techno 	 logies 	 	that	are	coming	 a 	 long 	 	are	going	to	be	,	and	i	thought	that	,	since	i	was	among	 friend 	 s 	 	here	,	i	would	tell	you	what	i	 re 	 ally 	 	think	and	try	to	look	back	and	try	to	understand	what	is	 re 	 ally 	 	going	on	here	with	these	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 jump 	 s 	 	in	technology	that	seem	so	fast	that	we	can	 bare 	 ly 	 	keep	on	top	of	it	.
so	i	'm	going	to	start	out	by	 show 	 ing 	 	just	one	 ver 	 y 	 	 bor 	 ing 	 	technology	slide	.
and	then	,	so	if	you	can	just	turn	on	the	slide	that	's	on	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	just	a	random	slide	that	i	 pick 	 ed 	 	out	of	my	file	.
what	i	want	to	show	you	is	not	so	much	the	 detail 	 s 	 	of	the	slide	,	but	the	general	form	of	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	to	be	a	slide	of	some	analysis	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	about	the	power	of	_UNK_	 micro 	 processor 	 s 	 	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	the	power	of	local	area	 network 	 s 	 	.
and	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	about	it	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	slide	,	like	so	 man 	 y 	 	technology	 slide 	 s 	 	that	we	're	used	to	,	is	a	sort	of	a	straight	line	on	a	semi	-	log	 curv 	 e 	 	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	every	step	here	 represent 	 s 	 	an	order	of	 magn 	 itude 	 	in	performance	scale	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	new	thing	that	we	talk	about	technology	on	semi	-	log	 curv 	 es 	 	.
 some 	 thing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	weird	is	going	on	here	.
and	that	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	what	i	'm	going	to	be	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	.
so	,	if	you	could	 br 	 ing 	 	up	the	 light 	 s 	 	.
if	you	could	 br 	 ing 	 	up	the	 light 	 s 	 	 high 	 er 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	just	going	to	use	a	piece	of	paper	here	.
now	why	do	we	draw	technology	 curv 	 es 	 	in	semi	-	log	 curv 	 es 	 	?
well	the	answer	is	,	if	i	drew	it	on	a	normal	 curv 	 e 	 	where	,	let	's	say	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 year 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	time	of	some	sort	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 what 	 ever 	 	measure	of	the	technology	that	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	graph	,	the	 graph 	 s 	 	look	sort	of	 s 	 il 	 ly 	 	.
they	sort	of	go	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	they	do	n't	tell	us	much	.
now	if	i	graph	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	some	other	technology	,	say	 transport 	 ation 	 	technology	,	on	a	semi	-	log	 curv 	 e 	 	,	it	would	look	 ver 	 y 	 	stupid	,	it	would	look	like	a	flat	line	.
but	when	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 qual 	 itative 	 ly 	 	changing	.
so	if	 transport 	 ation 	 	technology	was	moving	 a 	 long 	 	 a 	 s 	 	fast	 a 	 s 	 	 micro 	 processor 	 	technology	,	then	the	day	after	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	,	i	would	be	able	to	get	in	a	taxi	cab	and	be	in	tokyo	in	30	 second 	 s 	 	.
it	's	not	moving	like	that	.
and	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	_UNK_	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	technology	 develop 	 ment 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	self	-	 feed 	 ing 	 	growth	where	you	go	by	 order 	 s 	 	of	 magn 	 itude 	 	every	few	 year 	 s 	 	.
now	the	question	that	i	'd	like	to	ask	is	,	if	you	look	at	these	exponential	 curv 	 es 	 	,	they	do	n't	go	on	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
 thing 	 s 	 	just	ca	n't	possibly	keep	changing	 a 	 s 	 	fast	 a 	 s 	 	they	are	.
one	of	two	 thing 	 s 	 	is	going	to	happen	.
either	it	's	going	to	turn	 in 	 to 	 	a	sort	of	 classic 	 al 	 	s	-	 curv 	 e 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 total 	 ly 	 	different	 come 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	,	or	 may 	 be 	 	it	's	going	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
that	's	about	all	it	can	do	.
now	i	'm	an	optimist	,	so	i	sort	of	think	it	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	going	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
if	so	,	that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	what	we	're	in	the	middle	of	right	now	is	a	 transit 	 ion 	 	.
we	're	sort	of	on	 th 	 is 	 	line	in	a	 transit 	 ion 	 	from	the	way	the	world	used	to	be	to	some	new	way	that	the	world	is	.
and	so	what	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	ask	,	what	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	 my 	 self 	 	,	is	what	's	 th 	 is 	 	new	way	that	the	world	is	?
what	's	that	new	state	that	the	world	is	 head 	 ing 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	the	 transit 	 ion 	 	 seem 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 con 	 fusing 	 	when	we	're	right	in	the	middle	of	it	.
now	when	i	was	a	kid	growing	up	,	the	future	was	kind	of	the	year	2000	,	and	people	used	to	talk	about	what	would	happen	in	the	year	2000	.
now	here	's	a	 con 	 ference 	 	in	which	people	talk	about	the	future	,	and	you	notice	that	the	future	is	still	at	about	the	year	2000	.
it	's	about	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	we	go	out	.
so	in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	the	future	 ha 	 s 	 	kind	of	 be 	 en 	 	 shrink 	 ing 	 	one	year	per	year	for	my	whole	 life 	 time 	 	.
now	i	think	that	the	reason	is	 be 	 cause 	 	we	all	feel	that	 some 	 thing 	 	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	there	.
that	 transit 	 ion 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	.	we	can	all	sense	it	.
and	we	know	that	it	just	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	too	much	sense	to	think	out	30	,	50	 year 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	's	going	to	be	so	different	that	a	simple	extrapolation	of	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	just	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	any	sense	at	all	.
so	what	i	would	like	to	talk	about	is	what	that	could	be	,	what	that	 transit 	 ion 	 	could	be	that	we	're	going	through	.
now	in	order	to	do	that	i	'm	going	to	have	to	talk	about	a	bunch	of	stuff	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	technology	and	 computer 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	to	understand	 th 	 is 	 	is	to	 re 	 ally 	 	step	back	and	take	a	long	time	scale	look	at	 thing 	 s 	 	.
so	the	time	scale	that	i	would	like	to	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	on	is	the	time	scale	of	life	on	earth	.
so	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	picture	 make 	 s 	 	sense	if	you	look	at	it	a	few	billion	 year 	 s 	 	at	a	time	.
so	if	you	go	back	about	two	and	a	half	billion	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	earth	was	 th 	 is 	 	big	,	 steril 	 e 	 	hunk	of	rock	with	a	lot	of	 chemical 	 s 	 	 float 	 ing 	 	around	on	it	.
and	if	you	look	at	the	way	that	the	 chemical 	 s 	 	got	 organize 	 d 	 	,	we	begin	to	get	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	idea	of	how	they	do	it	.
and	i	think	that	there	's	 the 	 ories 	 	that	are	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	understand	about	how	it	 start 	 ed 	 	with	rna	,	but	i	'm	going	to	tell	a	sort	of	simple	story	of	it	,	which	is	that	,	at	that	time	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	little	 drop 	 s 	 	of	oil	 float 	 ing 	 	around	with	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	different	 recipe 	 s 	 	of	 chemical 	 s 	 	in	them	.
and	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 drop 	 s 	 	of	oil	had	a	 part 	 icular 	 	combination	of	 chemical 	 s 	 	in	them	which	 caus 	 ed 	 	them	to	 in 	 corporate 	 	 chemical 	 s 	 	from	the	 out 	 side 	 	and	grow	the	 drop 	 s 	 	of	oil	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	like	that	 start 	 ed 	 	to	split	and	divide	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	 we 	 re 	 	the	most	primitive	 form 	 s 	 	of	 cell 	 s 	 	in	a	sense	,	 t 	 hose 	 	little	 drop 	 s 	 	of	oil	.
but	now	 t 	 hose 	 	 drop 	 s 	 	of	oil	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 al 	 ive 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	say	it	now	,
 be 	 cause 	 	every	one	of	them	was	a	little	random	recipe	of	 chemical 	 s 	 	.
and	every	time	it	 divid 	 ed 	 	,	they	got	sort	of	 un 	 equal 	 	division	of	the	 chemical 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	them	.
and	so	every	drop	was	a	little	bit	different	.
in	fact	,	the	 drop 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	different	in	a	way	that	 caus 	 ed 	 	them	to	be	better	at	 incorpo 	 rating 	 	 chemical 	 s 	 	around	them	,	grew	more	and	 incorpo 	 rated 	 	more	 chemical 	 s 	 	and	 divid 	 ed 	 	more	.
so	 t 	 hose 	 	 tend 	 ed 	 	to	live	 long 	 er 	 	,	get	 express 	 ed 	 	more	.
now	that	's	sort	of	just	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	chemical	form	of	life	,	but	when	 thing 	 s 	 	got	 interest 	 ing 	 	was	when	these	 drop 	 s 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	a	trick	about	 abstract 	 ion 	 	.
 some 	 how 	 	by	ways	that	we	do	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	understand	,	these	little	 drop 	 s 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	to	write	down	information	.
they	 learn 	 ed 	 	to	record	the	information	that	was	the	recipe	of	the	cell	onto	a	 part 	 icular 	 	kind	of	chemical	 call 	 ed 	 	dna	.
so	in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	they	 work 	 ed 	 	out	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	 mind 	 less 	 	sort	of	 evolution 	 ary 	 	way	,	a	form	of	writing	that	let	them	write	down	what	they	 we 	 re 	 	,
so	that	that	way	of	writing	it	down	could	get	 cop 	 ied 	 	.
the	 amaz 	 ing 	 	thing	is	that	that	way	of	writing	 seem 	 s 	 	to	have	 stay 	 ed 	 	 stead 	 y 	 	since	it	 evolv 	 ed 	 	two	and	a	half	billion	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
in	fact	the	recipe	for	us	,	our	 gene 	 s 	 	,	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	that	same	code	and	that	same	way	of	writing	.
in	fact	,	every	living	creature	is	written	in	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	set	of	 letter 	 s 	 	and	the	same	code	.
in	fact	,	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	did	just	for	 amuse 	 ment 	 	 purpose 	 s 	 	is	we	can	now	write	 thing 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	code	.
and	i	've	got	here	a	little	100	_UNK_	of	white	powder	,	which	i	try	not	to	let	the	security	people	see	at	 air 	 port 	 s 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	in	it	--	what	i	did	is	i	took	 th 	 is 	 	code	--	the	code	 ha 	 s 	 	standard	 letter 	 s 	 	that	we	use	for	 symbol 	 izing 	 	it	--	and	i	wrote	my	business	card	onto	a	piece	of	dna	and	 ampl 	 ified 	 	it	10	to	the	22	 time 	 s 	 	.
so	if	 any 	 one 	 	would	like	a	hundred	million	copies	of	my	business	card	,	i	have	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	for	 every 	 one 	 	in	the	room	,	and	,	in	fact	,	 every 	 one 	 	in	the	world	,
and	it	's	right	here	.
if	i	had	 re 	 ally 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	_UNK_	,	i	would	have	put	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	virus	and	released	it	in	the	room	.
so	what	was	the	next	step	?
writing	down	the	dna	was	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	step	.
and	that	 caus 	 ed 	 	these	 cell 	 s 	 	--	that	 ke 	 pt 	 	them	happy	for	 an 	 other 	 	billion	 year 	 s 	 	.
but	then	there	was	 an 	 other 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	step	where	 thing 	 s 	 	 be 	 came 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	,	which	is	these	 cell 	 s 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	 ex 	 changing 	 	and	 commun 	 ic 	 ating 	 	information	,	so	that	they	 beg 	 an 	 	to	get	 commun 	 ities 	 	of	 cell 	 s 	 	.
i	do	n't	know	if	you	know	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	bacteria	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ex 	 change 	 	dna	.
now	that	's	why	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	 anti 	 biotic 	 	 resist 	 ance 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	.
some	bacteria	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	how	to	stay	away	from	 pen 	 icillin 	 	,	and	it	went	around	sort	of	creating	 it 	 s 	 	little	dna	information	with	other	bacteria	,	and	now	we	have	a	lot	of	bacteria	that	are	resistant	to	 pen 	 icillin 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	bacteria	communicate	.
now	what	 th 	 is 	 	communication	 allow 	 ed 	 	was	 commun 	 ities 	 	to	form	that	,	in	some	sense	,	 we 	 re 	 	in	the	same	boat	together	;	they	 we 	 re 	 	_UNK_	.
so	they	 surviv 	 ed 	 	or	they	 fail 	 ed 	 	together	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	that	if	a	community	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	,	all	the	 individual 	 s 	 	in	that	community	 we 	 re 	 	 repeat 	 ed 	 	more	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 favor 	 ed 	 	by	evolution	.
now	the	 transit 	 ion 	 	point	 happen 	 ed 	 	when	these	 commun 	 ities 	 	got	so	close	that	,	in	fact	,	they	got	together	and	 decide 	 d 	 	to	write	down	the	whole	recipe	for	the	community	together	on	one	string	of	dna	.
and	so	the	next	stage	that	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	in	life	took	about	 an 	 other 	 	billion	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	at	that	stage	,	we	have	multi	-	cellular	 commun 	 ities 	 	,	 commun 	 ities 	 	of	 lot 	 s 	 	of	different	 type 	 s 	 	of	 cell 	 s 	 	,	 work 	 ing 	 	together	 a 	 s 	 	a	single	organism	.
and	in	fact	,	we	're	 s 	 uch 	 	a	multi	-	cellular	community	.
we	have	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 cell 	 s 	 	that	are	not	out	for	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 any 	 more 	 	.
your	skin	cell	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 use 	 less 	 	 with 	 out 	 	a	heart	cell	,	muscle	cell	,	a	brain	cell	and	so	on	.
so	these	 commun 	 ities 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	to	evolve	so	that	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	level	on	which	evolution	was	taking	place	was	no	 long 	 er 	 	a	cell	,	but	a	community	which	we	call	an	organism	.
now	the	next	step	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	is	 with 	 in 	 	these	 commun 	 ities 	 	.
these	 commun 	 ities 	 	of	 cell 	 s 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 beg 	 an 	 	to	abstract	information	.
and	they	 beg 	 an 	 	building	 ver 	 y 	 	special	 structure 	 s 	 	that	did	 noth 	 ing 	 	but	process	information	 with 	 in 	 	the	community	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	neural	 structure 	 s 	 	.
so	 neuro 	 ns 	 	are	the	information	 process 	 ing 	 	apparatus	that	 t 	 hose 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	of	 cell 	 s 	 	built	up	.
and	in	fact	,	they	 beg 	 an 	 	to	get	 special 	 ists 	 	in	the	community	and	special	 structure 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	 record 	 ing 	 	,	 understand 	 ing 	 	,	 learn 	 ing 	 	information	.
and	that	was	the	 brain 	 s 	 	and	the	nervous	system	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	.
and	that	 g 	 ave 	 	them	an	 evolution 	 ary 	 	advantage	.
 be 	 cause 	 	at	that	point	,	an	individual	--	 learn 	 ing 	 	could	happen	 with 	 in 	 	the	time	span	of	a	single	organism	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	over	 th 	 is 	 	 evolution 	 ary 	 	time	span	.
so	an	organism	could	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	learn	not	to	eat	a	certain	kind	of	fruit	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 taste 	 d 	 	bad	and	it	got	sick	last	time	it	ate	it	.
that	could	happen	 with 	 in 	 	the	 life 	 time 	 	of	a	single	organism	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	before	they	'd	built	these	special	information	 process 	 ing 	 	 structure 	 s 	 	,	that	would	have	had	to	be	 learn 	 ed 	 	 evolution 	 arily 	 	over	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	by	the	 individual 	 s 	 	 dy 	 ing 	 	off	that	ate	that	kind	of	fruit	.
so	that	nervous	system	,	the	fact	that	they	built	these	special	information	 structure 	 s 	 	,	 tremendous 	 ly 	 	 s 	 ped 	 	up	the	whole	process	of	evolution	.
 be 	 cause 	 	evolution	could	now	happen	 with 	 in 	 	an	individual	.
it	could	happen	in	 learn 	 ing 	 	time	 scale 	 s 	 	.	but	then	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	was	the	 individual 	 s 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	out	,	of	course	,	 trick 	 s 	 	of	 commun 	 ic 	 ating 	 	.
and	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	the	most	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	version	that	we	're	aware	of	is	human	language	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 invent 	 ion 	 	if	you	think	about	it	.
here	i	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	,	 mess 	 y 	 	,	 con 	 fused 	 	idea	in	my	head	.
i	'm	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	here	making	 grunt 	 ing 	 	 sound 	 s 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	and	 hope 	 fully 	 	 construct 	 ing 	 	a	similar	 mess 	 y 	 	,	 con 	 fused 	 	idea	in	your	head	that	 bear 	 s 	 	some	 analog 	 y 	 	to	it	.
but	we	're	taking	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	,	 turn 	 ing 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	sound	,	 sequence 	 s 	 	of	 sound 	 s 	 	,	and	producing	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	in	your	brain	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 allow 	 s 	 	us	now	to	begin	to	start	 function 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	single	organism	.
and	so	,	in	fact	,	what	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	is	we	,	 human 	 ity 	 	,	have	 start 	 ed 	 	 abstract 	 ing 	 	out	.
we	're	going	through	the	same	 level 	 s 	 	that	multi	-	cellular	 organism 	 s 	 	have	gone	through	--	 abstract 	 ing 	 	out	our	 method 	 s 	 	of	 record 	 ing 	 	,	 present 	 ing 	 	,	 process 	 ing 	 	information	.
so	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	the	 invent 	 ion 	 	of	language	was	a	 tin 	 y 	 	step	in	that	direction	.
 tele 	 phony 	 	,	 computer 	 s 	 	,	_UNK_	,	cd	-	roms	and	so	on	are	all	our	 special 	 ized 	 	 mechan 	 ism 	 s 	 	that	we	've	now	built	 with 	 in 	 	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	for	 hand 	 ling 	 	that	information	.
and	it	all	 connect 	 s 	 	us	together	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	much	 big 	 ger 	 	and	much	 fast 	 er 	 	and	able	to	evolve	than	what	we	 we 	 re 	 	before	.
so	now	,	evolution	can	take	place	on	a	scale	of	 micro 	 second 	 s 	 	.
and	you	saw	ty	's	little	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	where	he	sort	of	did	a	little	bit	of	evolution	on	the	_UNK_	program	right	before	your	 eye 	 s 	 	.
so	now	we	've	 speed 	 ed 	 	up	the	time	 scale 	 s 	 	once	 aga 	 in 	 	.
so	the	first	 step 	 s 	 	of	the	story	that	i	told	you	about	took	a	billion	 year 	 s 	 	a	piece	.
and	the	next	 step 	 s 	 	,	like	nervous	 system 	 s 	 	and	 brain 	 s 	 	,	took	a	few	hundred	million	 year 	 s 	 	.
then	the	next	 step 	 s 	 	,	like	language	and	so	on	,	took	less	than	a	million	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	these	next	 step 	 s 	 	,	like	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	,	seem	to	be	taking	 on 	 ly 	 	a	few	 decade 	 s 	 	.
the	process	is	 feed 	 ing 	 	on	 it 	 self 	 	and	 be 	 coming 	 	,	i	guess	,	_UNK_	is	the	word	for	it	--	when	 some 	 thing 	 	 reinforce 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	rate	of	change	.
the	more	it	 change 	 s 	 	,	the	 fast 	 er 	 	it	 change 	 s 	 	.
and	i	think	that	that	's	what	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	here	in	 th 	 is 	 	explosion	of	 curv 	 e 	 	.
we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	process	 feed 	 ing 	 	back	on	 it 	 self 	 	.
now	i	design	 computer 	 s 	 	for	a	living	,	and	i	know	that	the	 mechan 	 ism 	 s 	 	that	i	use	to	design	 computer 	 s 	 	would	be	 im 	 possible 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 re 	 cent 	 	 advance 	 s 	 	in	 computer 	 s 	 	.
so	right	now	,	what	i	do	is	i	design	 object 	 s 	 	at	 s 	 uch 	 	 complex 	 ity 	 	that	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	for	me	to	design	them	in	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	sense	.
i	do	n't	know	what	every	transistor	in	the	 connect 	 ion 	 	machine	 do 	 es 	 	.
there	are	 billion 	 s 	 	of	them	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	what	i	do	and	what	the	 design 	 ers 	 	at	 think 	 ing 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	do	is	we	think	at	some	level	of	 abstract 	 ion 	 	and	then	we	hand	it	to	the	machine	and	the	machine	 take 	 s 	 	it	beyond	what	we	could	ever	do	,	much	 far 	 ther 	 	and	 fast 	 er 	 	than	we	could	ever	do	.
and	in	fact	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	it	 take 	 s 	 	it	by	 method 	 s 	 	that	we	do	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	even	understand	.
one	method	that	's	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	that	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	using	a	lot	 late 	 ly 	 	is	evolution	 it 	 self 	 	.
so	what	we	do	is	we	put	 in 	 side 	 	the	machine	a	process	of	evolution	that	 take 	 s 	 	place	on	the	 micro 	 second 	 	time	scale	.
so	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	in	the	most	 extrem 	 e 	 	 case 	 s 	 	,	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	evolve	a	program	by	 start 	 ing 	 	out	with	random	 sequence 	 s 	 	of	 instruct 	 ions 	 	.
say	,	``	computer	,	would	you	 pleas 	 e 	 	make	a	hundred	million	random	 sequence 	 s 	 	of	 instruct 	 ions 	 	.
now	would	you	 pleas 	 e 	 	run	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	random	 sequence 	 s 	 	of	 instruct 	 ions 	 	,	run	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 program 	 s 	 	,	and	pick	out	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	came	 close 	 st 	 	to	 do 	 ing 	 	what	i	 want 	 ed 	 	.	``	so	in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	i	define	what	i	 want 	 ed 	 	.
let	's	say	i	want	to	sort	 number 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	simple	 ex 	 ample 	 	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	it	with	.
so	find	the	 program 	 s 	 	that	come	 close 	 st 	 	to	 sort 	 ing 	 	 number 	 s 	 	.
so	of	course	,	random	 sequence 	 s 	 	of	 instruct 	 ions 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 like 	 ly 	 	to	sort	 number 	 s 	 	,	so	 non 	 e 	 	of	them	will	 re 	 ally 	 	do	it	.
but	one	of	them	,	by	luck	,	may	put	two	 number 	 s 	 	in	the	right	order	.
and	i	say	,	``	computer	,	would	you	 pleas 	 e 	 	now	take	the	10	percent	of	 t 	 hose 	 	random	 sequence 	 s 	 	that	did	the	best	job	.
 s 	 ave 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	.	kill	off	the	rest	.
and	now	let	's	 re 	 produce 	 	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	 sort 	 ed 	 	 number 	 s 	 	the	best	.
and	let	's	 re 	 produce 	 	them	by	a	process	of	 re 	 combination 	 	 analog 	 ous 	 	to	 s 	 ex 	 	.	``	take	two	 program 	 s 	 	and	they	produce	children	by	 ex 	 changing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 sub 	 routine 	 s 	 	,	and	the	children	inherit	the	 trait 	 s 	 	of	the	 sub 	 routine 	 s 	 	of	the	two	 program 	 s 	 	.
so	i	've	got	now	a	new	generation	of	 program 	 s 	 	that	are	 produce 	 d 	 	by	 combination 	 s 	 	of	the	 program 	 s 	 	that	did	a	little	bit	better	job	.
say	,	``	 pleas 	 e 	 	repeat	that	process	.	``	score	them	 aga 	 in 	 	.
 introduc 	 e 	 	some	 mutation 	 s 	 	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	.
and	try	that	 aga 	 in 	 	and	do	that	for	 an 	 other 	 	generation	.
well	every	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 generation 	 s 	 	just	 take 	 s 	 	a	few	 milli 	 second 	 s 	 	.
so	i	can	do	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	of	evolution	on	that	 with 	 in 	 	the	computer	in	a	few	 minute 	 s 	 	,	or	in	the	 complic 	 ated 	 	 case 	 s 	 	,	in	a	few	 hour 	 s 	 	.
at	the	end	of	that	,	i	end	up	with	 program 	 s 	 	that	are	 absolute 	 ly 	 	perfect	at	 sort 	 ing 	 	 number 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	they	are	 program 	 s 	 	that	are	much	more	efficient	than	 program 	 s 	 	i	could	have	ever	written	by	hand	.
now	if	i	look	at	 t 	 hose 	 	 program 	 s 	 	,	i	ca	n't	tell	you	how	they	work	.
i	've	 tri 	 ed 	 	looking	at	them	and	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	how	they	work	.
they	're	 obscur 	 e 	 	,	weird	 program 	 s 	 	.
but	they	do	the	job	.
and	in	fact	,	i	know	,	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	confident	that	they	do	the	job	 be 	 cause 	 	they	come	from	a	line	of	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 program 	 s 	 	that	did	the	job	.
in	fact	,	 the 	 ir 	 	life	 depend 	 ed 	 	on	 do 	 ing 	 	the	job	.
i	was	 rid 	 ing 	 	in	a	747	with	marvin	minsky	once	,	and	he	 pull 	 s 	 	out	 th 	 is 	 	card	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	oh	look	.	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	 say 	 s 	 	,	'	 th 	 is 	 	plane	 ha 	 s 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 tin 	 y 	 	 part 	 s 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	together	to	make	you	a	safe	flight	.	'	 do 	 es 	 	n't	that	make	you	feel	confident	?	``	in	fact	,	we	know	that	the	 engineer 	 ing 	 	process	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	 ver 	 y 	 	well	when	it	 get 	 s 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	.
so	we	're	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	depend	on	 computer 	 s 	 	to	do	a	process	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	different	than	 engineer 	 ing 	 	.
and	it	lets	us	produce	 thing 	 s 	 	of	much	more	 complex 	 ity 	 	than	normal	 engineer 	 ing 	 	lets	us	produce	.
and	yet	,	we	do	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	understand	the	 option 	 s 	 	of	it	.
so	in	a	sense	,	it	's	 get 	 ting 	 	 a 	 head 	 	of	us	.
we	're	now	using	 t 	 hose 	 	 program 	 s 	 	to	make	much	 fast 	 er 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	so	that	we	'll	be	able	to	run	 th 	 is 	 	process	much	 fast 	 er 	 	.
so	it	's	 feed 	 ing 	 	back	on	 it 	 self 	 	.
the	thing	is	 be 	 coming 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	and	that	's	why	i	think	it	 seem 	 s 	 	so	 con 	 fusing 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	all	of	these	 techno 	 logies 	 	are	 feed 	 ing 	 	back	on	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.	we	're	taking	off	.
and	what	we	are	is	we	're	at	a	point	in	time	which	is	 analog 	 ous 	 	to	when	single	-	celled	 organism 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 turn 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	multi	-	celled	 organism 	 s 	 	.
so	we	're	the	 amoeb 	 a 	 s 	 	and	we	ca	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	figure	out	what	the	hell	 th 	 is 	 	thing	is	we	're	creating	.
we	're	right	at	that	point	of	 transit 	 ion 	 	.
but	i	think	that	there	 re 	 ally 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	coming	 a 	 long 	 	after	us	.
i	think	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	_UNK_	of	us	to	think	that	we	're	the	end	product	of	evolution	.
and	i	think	all	of	us	here	are	a	part	of	producing	 what 	 ever 	 	that	next	thing	is	.
so	lunch	is	coming	 a 	 long 	 	,	and	i	think	i	will	stop	at	that	point	,	before	i	get	 select 	 ed 	 	out	.
