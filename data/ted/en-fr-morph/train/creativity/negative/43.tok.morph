 hell 	 o 	 	.	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	that	's	``	 hell 	 o 	 	``	in	bauer	bodoni	for	the	 typo 	 graphical 	 ly 	 	 hyster 	 ical 	 	 among 	 st 	 	us	.
one	of	the	 th 	 read 	 s 	 	that	 seem 	 s 	 	to	have	come	through	loud	and	clear	in	the	last	couple	of	 day 	 s 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	need	to	reconcile	what	the	big	 want 	 s 	 	--	the	``	big	``	 be 	 ing 	 	the	 organ 	 ization 	 	,	the	system	,	the	country	--	and	what	the	``	small	``	 want 	 s 	 	--	the	individual	,	the	person	.
and	how	do	you	 br 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 thing 	 s 	 	together	?
charlie	ledbetter	,	 yester 	 day 	 	,	i	thought	,	 talk 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 articulate 	 ly 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	need	to	 br 	 ing 	 	 consumer 	 s 	 	,	to	 br 	 ing 	 	people	 in 	 to 	 	the	process	of	creating	 thing 	 s 	 	.	and	that	's	what	i	want	to	talk	about	 to 	 day 	 	.
so	,	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	together	the	small	to	help	facilitate	and	create	the	big	,	i	think	,	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	 believ 	 e 	 	in	--	 some 	 thing 	 	i	 believ 	 e 	 	in	,	and	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	kind	of	 br 	 ing 	 	to	life	through	what	we	do	at	ideo	.
i	call	 th 	 is 	 	first	chapter	--	for	the	brits	in	the	room	--	the	``	 blind 	 ing 	 	 glimps 	 e 	 	of	the	 ble 	 ed 	 ing 	 	obvious	.	``
often	,	the	good	 idea 	 s 	 	are	so	 star 	 ing 	 	-	at	-	you	-	right	-	in	-	the	-	face	that	you	kind	of	 mis 	 s 	 	them	.	and	i	think	,	a	lot	of	 time 	 s 	 	,	what	we	do	is	just	,	sort	of	,	hold	the	mirror	up	to	our	 client 	 s 	 	,	and	sort	of	go	,	``	 d 	 uh 	 	!	you	know	,	look	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	going	on	.	``
and	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	talk	about	it	in	the	 theor 	 y 	 	,	i	think	i	'm	just	going	to	show	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	by	a	large	 health 	 care 	 	system	in	minnesota	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	to	them	what	 the 	 ir 	 	patient	experience	was	.
and	i	think	they	 we 	 re 	 	 expect 	 ing 	 	--	they	'd	 work 	 ed 	 	with	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 consult 	 ants 	 	before	--	i	think	they	 we 	 re 	 	 expect 	 ing 	 	some	kind	of	 hide 	 ous 	 	org	chart	with	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 bubble 	 s 	 	and	 system 	 ic 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	that	and	the	other	,
and	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 map 	 py 	 	stuff	.
or	even	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	some	kind	of	 ghast 	 ly 	 	death	-	by	-	powerpoint	thing	with	wowcharts	and	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	,	you	know	,	god	 know 	 s 	 	,	 what 	 ever 	 	.
the	first	thing	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 share 	 d 	 	with	them	was	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	'll	play	 th 	 is 	 	 un 	 til 	 	your	 eye 	 ball 	 s 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	 dis 	 solve 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	59	 second 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	film	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	minute	59	.
3:19	.
i	think	 some 	 thing 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	.	i	think	a	head	may	appear	in	a	second	.
5:10	.
5:58	.
6:20	.
we	 show 	 ed 	 	them	the	whole	cut	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	all	 complete 	 ly 	 	,	what	is	 th 	 is 	 	?
and	the	point	is	when	you	lie	in	a	hospital	bed	all	day	,	all	you	do	is	look	at	the	roof	,	and	it	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 shit 	 ty 	 	experience	.
and	just	 put 	 ting 	 	 your 	 self 	 	in	the	position	of	the	patient	--
 th 	 is 	 	is	christian	,	who	 work 	 s 	 	with	us	at	ideo	.
he	just	lay	in	the	hospital	bed	,	and	,	kind	of	,	 star 	 ed 	 	at	the	 poly 	 styrene 	 	 ceil 	 ing 	 	 tile 	 s 	 	for	a	 re 	 ally 	 	long	time	.
that	's	what	it	's	like	to	be	a	patient	in	the	hospital	.
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	sort	,	you	know	,	 blind 	 ing 	 	 glimps 	 e 	 	of	 ble 	 ed 	 ing 	 	obvious	.
oh	,	my	 good 	 ness 	 	.	so	,	looking	at	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	from	the	point	of	view	of	the	person	out	--	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	position	of	the	 organ 	 ization 	 	in	--	was	,	for	these	 guy 	 s 	 	,	 quit 	 e 	 	a	 revel 	 ation 	 	.
and	so	,	that	was	a	 re 	 ally 	 	catalytic	thing	for	them	.
so	they	 snap 	 ped 	 	 in 	 to 	 	action	.
they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	ok	,	it	's	not	about	 system 	 ic 	 	change	.	it	's	not	about	huge	,	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	need	to	do	.
it	's	about	 tin 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	can	make	a	huge	amount	of	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
so	we	 start 	 ed 	 	with	them	 proto 	 ty 	 ping 	 	some	 re 	 ally 	 	little	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	could	do	to	have	a	huge	amount	of	impact	.
the	first	thing	we	did	was	we	took	a	little	 bi 	 cycle 	 	mirror	and	we	band	-	aided	it	here	,	onto	a	 gur 	 ney 	 	,	a	hospital	 troll 	 ey 	 	,	so	that	when	you	 we 	 re 	 	 wheel 	 ed 	 	around	by	a	nurse	or	by	a	doctor	,	you	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	a	conversation	with	them	.
you	could	,	kind	of	,	see	them	in	your	rear	-	view	mirror	,	so	it	 create 	 d 	 	a	 tin 	 y 	 	human	 interact 	 ion 	 	.
 ver 	 y 	 	small	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 some 	 thing 	 	that	they	could	do	.
 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	the	 nurse 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	sort	of	,	 snap 	 ped 	 	 in 	 to 	 	action	--	 s 	 aid 	 	,	ok	,	we	embrace	 th 	 is 	 	.	what	can	we	do	?
the	first	thing	they	do	is	they	 decor 	 ated 	 	the	 ceil 	 ing 	 	.
which	i	thought	was	 re 	 ally 	 	--	i	 show 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	to	my	mother	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	.
i	think	my	mother	now	 think 	 s 	 	that	i	'm	some	sort	of	 in 	 terior 	 	 decor 	 ator 	 	.
it	's	what	i	do	for	a	living	,	sort	of	laurence	llewelyn	-	bowen	.
not	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	the	world	's	best	design	solution	for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	us	who	are	real	,	sort	of	,	hard	-	core	 design 	 ers 	 	,
but	 non 	 e 	 the 	 less 	 	,	a	fabulous	 empath 	 ic 	 	solution	for	people	.
 thing 	 s 	 	that	they	 start 	 ed 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	--	like	changing	the	floor	going	 in 	 to 	 	the	patient	's	room	so	that	it	 sign 	 ified 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	room	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	personal	space	``	--	was	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	sort	of	design	solution	to	the	problem	.
so	you	went	from	public	space	to	private	space	.
and	 an 	 other 	 	idea	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	that	came	from	one	of	the	 nurse 	 s 	 	--	which	i	love	--	was	they	took	 tradition 	 al 	 	,	sort	of	,	corporate	white	 board 	 s 	 	,	then	they	put	them	on	one	wall	of	the	patient	's	room	,	and	they	put	 th 	 is 	 	 stick 	 er 	 	there	.
so	that	what	you	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	was	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	room	and	write	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	to	the	person	who	was	sick	in	that	room	,	which	was	 love 	 ly 	 	.
so	,	 tin 	 y 	 	,	 tin 	 y 	 	,	 tin 	 y 	 	 solution 	 s 	 	that	made	a	huge	amount	of	impact	.
i	thought	that	was	a	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	nice	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	a	new	idea	,	kind	of	,	 see 	 ing 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	in	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	around	you	and	 snap 	 ping 	 	and	 turn 	 ing 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	a	solution	.
it	's	a	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 invent 	 ion 	 	based	around	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	read	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	want	to	get	these	 name 	 s 	 	right	.
joan	 gan 	 z 	 	cooney	saw	her	daughter	--	came	down	on	a	saturday	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	saw	her	daughter	 watch 	 ing 	 	the	test	card	,	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	 program 	 s 	 	to	come	on	one	 morn 	 ing 	 	and	from	that	came	 s 	 e 	 same 	 	street	.
malcolm	mclean	was	moving	from	one	country	to	 an 	 other 	 	and	was	 wonder 	 ing 	 	why	it	took	these	 guy 	 s 	 	so	long	to	get	the	boxes	onto	the	ship	.
and	he	 invent 	 ed 	 	the	 ship 	 ping 	 	 contain 	 er 	 	.	george	de	mestral	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 bug 	 s 	 	all	over	a	birkenstock	--	was	 walk 	 ing 	 	his	dog	in	a	field	and	got	 cover 	 ed 	 	in	 burr 	 s 	 	,	sort	of	little	 prick 	 ly 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	from	that	came	velcro	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	for	the	brits	,	percy	shaw	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	big	british	 invent 	 ion 	 	--	saw	the	cat	's	 eye 	 s 	 	at	the	side	of	the	road	,	when	he	was	 driv 	 ing 	 	home	one	night	and	from	that	came	the	catseye	.
so	there	's	a	whole	 s 	 eries 	 	of	just	using	your	 eye 	 s 	 	,	 see 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	for	the	first	time	,	 see 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 a 	 fresh 	 	and	using	them	 a 	 s 	 	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	create	new	 possibil 	 ities 	 	.
second	one	,	 with 	 out 	 	 sound 	 ing 	 	 over 	 ly 	 	zen	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	quote	from	the	buddha	:	``	 find 	 ing 	 	 your 	 self 	 	in	the	 margin 	 s 	 	,	looking	to	the	 edge 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	,	is	often	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	place	to	start	.	``
 blink 	 er 	 ed 	 	vision	 tend 	 s 	 	to	produce	,	i	think	,	 blink 	 er 	 ed 	 	 solution 	 s 	 	.
so	,	looking	wide	,	using	your	 per 	 iph 	 er 	 al 	 	vision	,	is	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	place	to	look	for	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	 an 	 other 	 	medical	 ex 	 ample 	 	here	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	by	a	 de 	 vice 	 	 produce 	 r 	 	--	we	did	the	palm	pilot	and	the	treo	.
we	did	a	lot	of	sexy	tech	at	ideo	--	they	'd	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	and	they	 want 	 ed 	 	a	sexy	piece	of	technology	for	medical	 diagnos 	 tics 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	 de 	 vice 	 	that	a	nurse	uses	when	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	a	 spin 	 al 	 	procedure	in	hospital	.
they	'll	ask	the	 nurse 	 s 	 	to	 in 	 put 	 	data	.
and	they	had	 th 	 is 	 	vision	of	the	nurse	,	kind	of	,	 click 	 ing 	 	away	on	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 lumin 	 um 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	and	it	all	 be 	 ing 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	,	sort	of	,	gadget	-	lustish	.
when	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	went	and	 watch 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	procedure	taking	place	--	and	i	'll	explain	 th 	 is 	 	in	a	second	--	it	 be 	 came 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	obvious	that	there	was	a	human	dimension	to	 th 	 is 	 	that	they	 re 	 ally 	 	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 recogn 	 izing 	 	.
when	you	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	four	-	inch	needle	 insert 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	your	 s 	 pine 	 	--	which	was	the	procedure	that	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	's	data	was	about	;	it	was	for	pain	management	--	you	're	shit	 scar 	 ed 	 	;	you	're	 freak 	 ing 	 	out	.
and	so	the	first	thing	that	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	every	nurse	did	,	was	hold	the	patient	's	hand	to	comfort	them	.	human	 gest 	 ure 	 	--	which	made	the	fabulous	two	-	 hand 	 ed 	 	data	 in 	 put 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	.
so	,	the	thing	that	we	designed	,	much	less	sexy	but	much	more	human	and	practical	,	was	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	,	it	's	not	a	palm	pilot	by	any	stretch	of	the	 imagin 	 ation 	 	,	but	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	thumb	-	scroll	so	you	can	do	 every 	 thing 	 	with	one	hand	.
so	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	going	back	to	 th 	 is 	 	--	the	idea	that	a	 tin 	 y 	 	human	 gest 	 ure 	 	 dict 	 ated 	 	the	design	of	 th 	 is 	 	product	.
and	i	think	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
so	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	 work 	 around 	 s 	 	.
we	use	 th 	 is 	 	phrase	``	 work 	 around 	 s 	 	``	a	lot	,	sort	of	,	looking	around	us	.	i	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	looking	around	the	ted	and	just	 watch 	 ing 	 	all	of	these	kind	of	 thing 	 s 	 	happen	while	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	here	.
 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	the	way	that	people	cobble	together	 solution 	 s 	 	in	our	life	--	and	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	kind	of	do	in	our	environment	that	are	 some 	 what 	 	 sub 	 conscious 	 	but	have	huge	potential	--	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	look	at	a	lot	.
we	wrote	a	book	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	i	think	you	might	have	 receiv 	 ed 	 	it	,	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 thought 	 less 	 	 act 	 s 	 	?	``
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	all	about	these	kind	of	 thought 	 less 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	people	do	,	which	have	huge	 intent 	 ion 	 	and	huge	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
why	do	we	all	follow	the	line	in	the	street	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	in	a	japanese	 sub 	 way 	 	.
people	 conscious 	 ly 	 	follow	 thing 	 s 	 	even	 th 	 ough 	 	,	why	,	we	do	n't	know	.
why	do	we	line	up	the	square	milk	 car 	 ton 	 	with	the	square	 f 	 ence 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	we	kind	of	have	to	--	we	're	just	 compel 	 led 	 	to	.
we	do	n't	know	why	,	but	we	do	.
why	do	we	wrap	the	 tea 	 bag 	 	string	around	the	cup	handle	?
 aga 	 in 	 	,	we	're	sort	of	using	the	world	around	us	to	create	our	own	design	 solution 	 s 	 	.
and	we	're	 al 	 ways 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	to	our	 client 	 s 	 	:	``	you	should	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	.
 th 	 is 	 	stuff	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	is	 re 	 ally 	 	vital	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	people	 design 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 experience 	 s 	 	.
you	can	draw	from	 th 	 is 	 	.
we	sort	of	 assum 	 e 	 	that	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	a	pole	in	the	street	,	that	it	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	to	use	it	,	so	we	park	our	 shop 	 ping 	 	cart	there	.
it	's	there	for	our	use	,	on	some	level	.
so	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	we	sort	of	co	-	opt	our	environment	to	do	all	these	different	 thing 	 s 	 	.
we	co	-	opt	other	 experience 	 s 	 	--	we	take	one	item	and	transfer	it	to	 an 	 other 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	one	.	my	mother	used	to	say	to	me	,	``	just	 be 	 cause 	 	your	sister	 jump 	 s 	 	in	the	lake	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	you	have	to	.	``
but	,	of	course	,	we	all	do	.	we	all	follow	each	other	every	day	.
so	 some 	 body 	 	 assum 	 es 	 	that	 be 	 cause 	 	 some 	 body 	 	else	 ha 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	,	that	's	 per 	 mission 	 	for	them	to	do	the	same	thing	.
and	there	's	 al 	 most 	 	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	semaphore	around	us	all	the	time	.
i	mean	,	 shop 	 ping 	 	bag	 equal 	 s 	 	``	 park 	 ing 	 	meter	out	of	order	.	``
and	we	all	,	kind	of	,	know	how	to	read	these	 signal 	 s 	 	now	.
we	all	talk	to	one	 an 	 other 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 high 	 ly 	 	visual	way	 with 	 out 	 	 real 	 izing 	 	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	.
third	section	is	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	not	 know 	 ing 	 	,	of	 conscious 	 ly 	 	 put 	 ting 	 	 your 	 self 	 	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	.
i	talk	about	 un 	 think 	 ing 	 	 situ 	 ations 	 	all	the	time	.
sort	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	 beg 	 inner 	 	's	mind	,	 scrap 	 ing 	 	your	mind	clean	and	looking	at	 thing 	 s 	 	 a 	 fresh 	 	.
a	friend	of	mine	was	a	 design 	 er 	 	at	ikea	,	and	he	was	 ask 	 ed 	 	by	his	 bo 	 s 	 s 	 	to	help	design	a	 s 	 to 	 rage 	 	system	for	children	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	billy	 book 	 case 	 	--	it	's	ikea	's	 big 	 gest 	 	selling	product	.
hammer	it	together	.	hammer	it	together	with	a	shoe	,	if	you	're	me	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 im 	 possible 	 	to	assemble	.
but	big	selling	 book 	 case 	 	.	how	do	we	replicate	 th 	 is 	 	for	children	?
the	 re 	 ality 	 	is	when	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	watch	children	,	children	do	n't	think	about	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 s 	 to 	 rage 	 	in	linear	 term 	 s 	 	.
children	 assum 	 e 	 	 per 	 mission 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	way	.
children	live	on	 thing 	 s 	 	.	they	live	under	 thing 	 s 	 	.
they	live	around	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	so	 the 	 ir 	 	spatial	 aware 	 ness 	 	relationship	,	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	around	 s 	 to 	 rage 	 	is	 total 	 ly 	 	different	.
so	the	first	thing	you	have	to	do	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	graham	,	the	 design 	 er 	 	--	is	,	sort	of	,	put	 your 	 self 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 shoe 	 s 	 	.	and	so	,	here	he	is	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	under	the	table	.
so	,	what	came	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 s 	 to 	 rage 	 	system	that	he	designed	.
so	what	is	 th 	 is 	 	?	i	hear	you	all	ask	.	no	,	i	do	n't	.
it	's	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 love 	 ly 	 	solution	.
so	,	you	know	,	it	's	a	 total 	 ly 	 	different	way	of	looking	at	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
it	's	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	 empath 	 ic 	 	solution	--	 a 	 part 	 	from	the	fact	that	 ted 	 dy 	 	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	not	loving	it	.
but	a	 re 	 ally 	 	nice	way	of	re	-	framing	the	 ordin 	 ary 	 	,	and	i	think	that	's	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	 put 	 ting 	 	 your 	 self 	 	in	the	position	of	the	person	,	and	i	think	that	's	one	of	the	 th 	 read 	 s 	 	that	i	've	heard	 aga 	 in 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	is	how	do	we	put	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	other	 people 	 s 	 	'	 shoe 	 s 	 	and	 re 	 ally 	 	feel	what	they	feel	?
and	then	use	that	information	to	fuel	 solution 	 s 	 	?
and	i	think	that	's	what	 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	much	about	.
last	section	:	green	 arm 	 band 	 	.	we	've	all	got	them	.	it	's	about	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	.
i	mean	,	it	's	about	 pick 	 ing 	 	 battle 	 s 	 	big	 en 	 ough 	 	to	matter	but	small	 en 	 ough 	 	to	win	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	that	's	one	of	the	 theme 	 s 	 	that	i	think	 ha 	 s 	 	come	through	loud	and	clear	in	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	is	:	where	do	we	start	?	how	do	we	start	?	what	do	we	do	to	start	?
so	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	design	a	water	pump	for	a	company	 call 	 ed 	 	approtec	,	in	kenya	.
they	're	now	 call 	 ed 	 	kickstart	.
and	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 design 	 ers 	 	,	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	thing	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	and	 s 	 pend 	 	a	lot	of	time	 think 	 ing 	 	of	the	form	.
and	that	was	 complete 	 ly 	 	 ir 	 relevant 	 	.
when	you	put	 your 	 self 	 	in	the	position	of	these	people	,	 thing 	 s 	 	like	the	fact	that	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	able	to	fold	up	and	fit	on	a	 bi 	 cycle 	 	,	 be 	 come 	 	much	more	relevant	than	the	form	of	it	.	the	way	it	's	 produce 	 d 	 	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 produce 	 d 	 	with	 indi 	 genous 	 	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	 method 	 s 	 	and	 indi 	 genous 	 	 material 	 s 	 	.
so	it	had	to	be	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 complete 	 ly 	 	from	the	point	of	view	of	the	user	.
we	had	to	 complete 	 ly 	 	transfer	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	over	to	 the 	 ir 	 	world	.
so	what	 seem 	 s 	 	like	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 clunk 	 y 	 	product	is	,	in	fact	,	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	.
it	's	powered	a	bit	like	a	stairmaster	--	you	pump	up	and	down	on	it	.
children	can	use	it	.	 adult 	 s 	 	can	use	it	.	 every 	 body 	 	uses	it	.
it	's	 turn 	 ing 	 	these	 guy 	 s 	 	--	 aga 	 in 	 	,	one	of	the	 theme 	 s 	 	--	it	's	 turn 	 ing 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	.
these	 guy 	 s 	 	are	using	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 success 	 fully 	 	.
and	for	us	,	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	great	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	won	 load 	 s 	 	of	design	 a 	 ward 	 s 	 	.
so	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 manage 	 d 	 	to	reconcile	the	 need 	 s 	 	of	the	design	company	,	the	 need 	 s 	 	of	the	 individual 	 s 	 	in	the	company	,	to	feel	good	about	a	product	we	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 design 	 ing 	 	,	and	the	 need 	 s 	 	of	the	 individual 	 s 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	 design 	 ing 	 	it	for	.
there	it	is	,	 pump 	 ing 	 	water	from	30	feet	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	a	final	 gest 	 ure 	 	we	 hand 	 ed 	 	out	these	 brace 	 lets 	 	to	all	of	you	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
we	've	made	a	 don 	 ation 	 	on	 every 	 body 	 	's	 be 	 half 	 	here	to	kick	start	,	no	pun	 intend 	 ed 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	next	project	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	i	think	,	sort	of	,	 put 	 ting 	 	our	money	where	our	mouth	is	,	here	.
we	feel	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 import 	 ant 	 	 gest 	 ure 	 	.
so	we	've	 hand 	 ed 	 	out	 brace 	 lets 	 	.	small	is	the	new	big	.
i	hope	you	'll	all	wear	them	.
