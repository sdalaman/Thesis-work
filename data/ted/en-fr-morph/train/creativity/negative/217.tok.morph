i	think	it	'll	be	a	relief	to	some	people	and	a	 disappoint 	 ment 	 	to	 other 	 s 	 	that	i	'm	not	going	to	talk	about	 vagina 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
i	 beg 	 an 	 	``	the	vagina	 monologue 	 s 	 	``	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	 vagina 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	 worri 	 ed 	 	 to 	 day 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	world	,	 th 	 is 	 	 prevail 	 ing 	 	kind	of	force	of	security	.
i	see	 th 	 is 	 	word	,	hear	 th 	 is 	 	word	,	feel	 th 	 is 	 	word	 every 	 where 	 	.
real	security	,	security	 check 	 s 	 	,	security	watch	,	security	 clear 	 ance 	 	.
why	 ha 	 s 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	focus	on	security	made	me	feel	so	much	more	 in 	 secure 	 	?
what	 do 	 es 	 	 any 	 one 	 	mean	when	they	talk	about	real	security	?
and	why	have	we	,	 a 	 s 	 	americans	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	,	 be 	 come 	 	a	nation	that	 striv 	 es 	 	for	security	above	all	else	?
in	fact	,	i	think	that	security	is	elusive	.	it	's	 im 	 possible 	 	.
we	all	die	.	we	all	get	old	.	we	all	get	sick	.	people	 leav 	 e 	 	us	.
people	change	us	.	 noth 	 ing 	 	is	secure	.
and	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	good	news	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	,	of	course	,	 un 	 less 	 	your	whole	life	is	about	 be 	 ing 	 	secure	.
i	think	that	when	that	is	the	focus	of	your	life	,	these	are	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	happen	.
you	ca	n't	travel	 ver 	 y 	 	far	or	venture	too	far	 out 	 side 	 	a	certain	circle	.
you	ca	n't	allow	too	 man 	 y 	 	 conflict 	 ing 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	your	mind	at	one	time	,	 a 	 s 	 	they	might	 con 	 fuse 	 	you	or	 challeng 	 e 	 	you	.
you	ca	n't	open	 your 	 self 	 	to	new	 experience 	 s 	 	,	new	people	,	new	ways	of	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	--	they	might	take	you	off	course	.
you	ca	n't	not	know	who	you	are	,	so	you	 cl 	 ing 	 	to	hard	-	matter	 ident 	 ity 	 	.
you	 be 	 come 	 	a	christian	,	muslim	,	jew	.
you	're	an	indian	,	egyptian	,	italian	,	american	.
you	're	a	 hetero 	 sexual 	 	or	a	 homo 	 sexual 	 	,	or	you	never	have	 s 	 ex 	 	.
or	at	 l 	 east 	 	,	that	's	what	you	say	when	you	identify	 your 	 self 	 	.
you	 be 	 come 	 	part	of	an	``	us	.	``
in	order	to	be	secure	,	you	defend	against	``	them	.	``
you	 cl 	 ing 	 	to	your	land	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	your	secure	place	.
you	must	fight	 any 	 one 	 	who	 encroach 	 es 	 	 up 	 on 	 	it	.
you	 be 	 come 	 	your	nation	.	you	 be 	 come 	 	your	 relig 	 ion 	 	.
you	 be 	 come 	 	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	that	will	freeze	you	,	numb	you	and	protect	you	from	doubt	or	change	.
but	all	 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	is	shut	down	your	mind	.
in	 re 	 ality 	 	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	not	 re 	 ally 	 	make	you	 safe 	 r 	 	.
i	was	in	sri	lanka	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	three	 day 	 s 	 	after	the	tsunami	,	and	i	was	 stand 	 ing 	 	on	the	 beach 	 es 	 	and	it	was	 absolute 	 ly 	 	clear	that	,	in	a	matter	of	five	 minute 	 s 	 	,	a	30	-	foot	wave	could	rise	up	and	 de 	 sec 	 rate 	 	a	people	,	a	population	and	 live 	 s 	 	.
all	 th 	 is 	 	 striv 	 ing 	 	for	security	,	in	fact	,	 ha 	 s 	 	made	you	much	more	 in 	 secure 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	now	you	have	to	watch	out	all	the	time	.

there	are	 t 	 hose 	 	who	,	if	they	're	not	with	us	,	are	against	us	.
it	 get 	 s 	 	 eas 	 ier 	 	to	hurt	people	 be 	 cause 	 	you	do	not	feel	what	's	 in 	 side 	 	them	.
it	 get 	 s 	 	 eas 	 ier 	 	to	lock	them	up	,	force	them	to	be	naked	,	 humil 	 iate 	 	them	,	occupy	them	,	 invad 	 e 	 	them	and	kill	them	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	 on 	 ly 	 	 obstacle 	 s 	 	now	to	your	security	.
in	six	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	've	had	the	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	privilege	through	v	-	day	,	a	global	 move 	 ment 	 	against	[	violence	against	]	women	,	to	travel	 prob 	 ably 	 	to	60	 count 	 ries 	 	,	and	 s 	 pend 	 	a	great	deal	of	time	in	different	 port 	 ions 	 	.
i	've	met	women	and	men	all	over	 th 	 is 	 	planet	,	who	through	 vari 	 ous 	 	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	--	war	,	poverty	,	 rac 	 ism 	 	,	 multi 	 ple 	 	 form 	 s 	 	of	violence	--	have	never	known	security	,	or	have	had	 the 	 ir 	 	illusion	of	security	 fore 	 ver 	 	 deva 	 state 	 d 	 	.
i	've	 s 	 pent 	 	time	with	women	in	afghanistan	under	the	taliban	,	who	 we 	 re 	 	 essential 	 ly 	 	 brutal 	 ized 	 	and	 censor 	 ed 	 	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	in	bosnian	 refuge 	 e 	 	 camp 	 s 	 	.

one	of	the	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	've	 discover 	 ed 	 	in	my	 travel 	 s 	 	is	that	there	is	 th 	 is 	 	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	species	.
i	 love 	 d 	 	when	he	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	other	world	that	's	right	next	to	 th 	 is 	 	world	.
i	've	 discover 	 ed 	 	these	people	,	who	,	in	v	-	day	world	,	we	call	vagina	 warrior 	 s 	 	.
these	 part 	 icular 	 	people	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 get 	 ting 	 	ak	-	47s	,	or	 weapon 	 s 	 	of	mass	 destruct 	 ion 	 	,	or	 machete 	 s 	 	,	in	the	spirit	of	the	warrior	,	have	gone	 in 	 to 	 	the	center	,	the	heart	of	pain	,	of	loss	.
they	have	 griev 	 ed 	 	it	,	they	have	 di 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	it	,	and	 allow 	 ed 	 	and	 encourag 	 ed 	 	poison	to	turn	 in 	 to 	 	medicine	.
they	have	used	the	fuel	of	 the 	 ir 	 	pain	to	begin	to	 re 	 direct 	 	that	energy	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 an 	 other 	 	mission	and	 an 	 other 	 	 tra 	 ject 	 ory 	 	.
these	 warrior 	 s 	 	now	devote	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	to	making	 s 	 ure 	 	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	them	 do 	 es 	 	n't	happen	to	 any 	 one 	 	else	.
there	are	 thousand 	 s 	 	if	not	 million 	 s 	 	of	them	on	the	planet	.
i	venture	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	.
they	have	a	 fierce 	 ness 	 	and	a	 free 	 dom 	 	that	i	 believ 	 e 	 	is	the	 bed 	 rock 	 	of	a	new	paradigm	.
they	have	broken	out	of	the	 exist 	 ing 	 	frame	of	victim	and	 perpet 	 rator 	 	.
 the 	 ir 	 	own	personal	security	is	not	 the 	 ir 	 	end	goal	,	and	 be 	 cause 	 	of	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 worry 	 ing 	 	about	security	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 transform 	 ation 	 	of	 suffer 	 ing 	 	is	 the 	 ir 	 	end	goal	,	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	they	are	creating	real	 safe 	 ty 	 	and	a	whole	new	idea	of	security	.
i	want	to	talk	about	a	few	of	these	people	that	i	've	met	.
 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	,	i	am	going	to	cairo	,	and	i	'm	so	 move 	 d 	 	that	i	will	be	with	women	in	cairo	who	are	v	-	day	women	,	who	are	 open 	 ing 	 	the	first	safe	house	for	 batt 	 er 	 ed 	 	women	in	the	middle	east	.
that	will	happen	 be 	 cause 	 	women	in	cairo	made	a	decision	to	stand	up	and	put	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	on	the	line	,	and	talk	about	the	degree	of	violence	that	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	egypt	,	and	 we 	 re 	 	 will 	 ing 	 	to	be	 attack 	 ed 	 	and	 critic 	 ized 	 	.	and	through	 the 	 ir 	 	work	over	the	last	 year 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	house	is	 open 	 ing 	 	,	but	it	's	 be 	 ing 	 	 support 	 ed 	 	by	 man 	 y 	 	 fact 	 ions 	 	of	the	 socie 	 ty 	 	who	never	would	have	 support 	 ed 	 	it	.
women	in	uganda	 th 	 is 	 	year	,	who	put	on	``	the	vagina	 monologue 	 s 	 	``	 dur 	 ing 	 	v	-	day	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	 evoke 	 d 	 	the	wrath	of	the	government	.
and	,	i	love	 th 	 is 	 	story	so	much	.	there	was	a	cabinet	 meet 	 ing 	 	and	a	 meet 	 ing 	 	of	the	 pre 	 sidents 	 	to	talk	about	 whet 	 her 	 	``	 vagina 	 s 	 	``	could	come	to	uganda	.
and	in	 th 	 is 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 	--	it	went	on	for	 week 	 s 	 	in	the	press	,	two	 week 	 s 	 	where	there	was	huge	 discuss 	 ion 	 	.
the	government	 final 	 ly 	 	made	a	decision	that	``	the	vagina	 monologue 	 s 	 	``	could	not	be	 perform 	 ed 	 	in	uganda	.
but	the	 amaz 	 ing 	 	news	was	that	 be 	 cause 	 	they	had	stood	up	,	these	women	,	and	 be 	 cause 	 	they	had	 be 	 en 	 	 will 	 ing 	 	to	risk	 the 	 ir 	 	security	,	it	 beg 	 an 	 	a	 discuss 	 ion 	 	that	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	uganda	,	but	all	of	africa	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	result	,	 th 	 is 	 	production	,	which	had	 al 	 ready 	 	 s 	 old 	 	out	,	every	single	person	in	that	800	-	seat	audience	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	10	people	,	made	a	decision	to	keep	the	money	.
they	raised	10,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	on	a	production	that	never	 occur 	 red 	 	.
there	's	a	young	woman	named	carrie	rethlefsen	in	minnesota	.
she	's	a	high	school	student	.
she	had	 s 	 een 	 	``	the	vagina	 monologue 	 s 	 	``	and	she	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 move 	 d 	 	.	and	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	,	she	 wo 	 re 	 	an	``	i	heart	my	vagina	``	button	to	her	high	school	in	minnesota	.
she	was	 bas 	 ically 	 	 threaten 	 ed 	 	to	be	 exp 	 ell 	 ed 	 	from	school	.
they	told	her	she	could	n't	love	her	vagina	in	high	school	,	that	it	was	not	a	legal	thing	,	that	it	was	not	a	moral	thing	,	that	it	was	not	a	good	thing	.
so	she	 re 	 ally 	 	 struggle 	 d 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	,	what	to	do	,	 be 	 cause 	 	she	was	a	senior	and	she	was	 do 	 ing 	 	well	in	her	school	and	she	was	 threaten 	 ed 	 	 ex 	 pulsion 	 	.	so	what	she	did	is	she	got	all	her	 friend 	 s 	 	together	--	i	 believ 	 e 	 	it	was	100	,	150	 student 	 s 	 	all	 wo 	 re 	 	``	i	love	my	vagina	``	t	-	 shirt 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 boy 	 s 	 	 wo 	 re 	 	``	i	love	her	vagina	``	t	-	 shirt 	 s 	 	to	school	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	 seem 	 s 	 	like	a	 fair 	 ly 	 	,	you	know	,	frivolous	,	but	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	that	,	is	that	that	school	now	is	 form 	 ing 	 	a	 s 	 ex 	 	education	class	.	it	's	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	talk	about	 s 	 ex 	 	,	it	's	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	look	at	why	it	would	be	wrong	for	a	young	high	school	girl	to	talk	about	her	vagina	 public 	 ly 	 	or	to	say	that	she	 love 	 d 	 	her	vagina	 public 	 ly 	 	.
i	know	i	've	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	agnes	here	before	,	but	i	want	to	give	you	an	update	on	agnes	.
i	met	agnes	three	 year 	 s 	 	ago	in	the	rift	 val 	 ley 	 	.
when	she	was	a	young	girl	,	she	had	 be 	 en 	 	 mutilate 	 d 	 	against	her	will	.
that	 mut 	 il 	 ation 	 	of	her	clitoris	had	 actual 	 ly 	 	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 impact 	 ed 	 	her	life	and	 change 	 d 	 	it	in	a	way	that	was	 deva 	 stat 	 ing 	 	.
she	made	a	decision	not	to	go	and	get	a	razor	or	a	glass	 s 	 hard 	 	,	but	to	devote	her	life	to	 stop 	 ping 	 	that	 happen 	 ing 	 	to	other	 girl 	 s 	 	.
for	eight	 year 	 s 	 	,	she	 walk 	 ed 	 	through	the	rift	 val 	 ley 	 	.
she	had	 th 	 is 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	box	that	she	carried	and	it	had	a	 tors 	 o 	 	of	a	woman	's	body	in	it	,	a	half	a	 tors 	 o 	 	,	and	she	would	teach	people	,	 every 	 where 	 	she	went	,	what	a	 health 	 y 	 	vagina	 look 	 ed 	 	like	and	what	a	 mutilate 	 d 	 	vagina	 look 	 ed 	 	like	.
in	the	 year 	 s 	 	that	she	 walk 	 ed 	 	,	she	educated	 parent 	 s 	 	,	 mother 	 s 	 	,	 father 	 s 	 	.	she	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	1,500	 girl 	 s 	 	from	 be 	 ing 	 	cut	.
when	v	-	day	met	her	,	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	her	how	we	could	support	her	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	if	you	got	me	a	jeep	,	i	could	get	around	a	lot	 fast 	 er 	 	.	``	so	,	we	 b 	 ought 	 	her	a	jeep	.
in	the	year	she	had	the	jeep	,	she	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	4,500	 girl 	 s 	 	from	 be 	 ing 	 	cut	.
so	,	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	what	else	could	we	do	?
she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	if	you	help	me	get	money	,	i	could	open	a	house	.	``
three	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	agnes	 open 	 ed 	 	a	safe	house	in	africa	to	stop	 mut 	 il 	 ation 	 	.
when	she	 beg 	 an 	 	her	mission	eight	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	she	was	 re 	 vil 	 ed 	 	,	she	was	 de 	 tested 	 	,	she	was	 complete 	 ly 	 	 s 	 land 	 er 	 ed 	 	in	her	community	.
i	am	proud	to	tell	you	that	six	 month 	 s 	 	ago	,	she	was	 elect 	 ed 	 	the	 de 	 put 	 y 	 	mayor	of	narok	.
i	think	what	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	say	here	is	that	if	your	end	goal	is	security	,	and	if	that	's	all	you	're	 focus 	 ing 	 	on	,	what	 end 	 s 	 	up	 happen 	 ing 	 	is	that	you	create	not	 on 	 ly 	 	more	 in 	 security 	 	in	other	people	,	but	you	make	 your 	 self 	 	far	more	 in 	 secure 	 	.
real	security	is	 contempl 	 ating 	 	death	,	not	 pretend 	 ing 	 	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	exist	.
not	running	from	loss	,	but	 enter 	 ing 	 	grief	,	 surrender 	 ing 	 	to	sorrow	.
real	security	is	not	 know 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	,	when	you	do	n't	know	it	.
real	security	is	 hung 	 er 	 ing 	 	for	 connect 	 ion 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	power	.
it	can	not	be	 b 	 ought 	 	or	 arrange 	 d 	 	or	made	with	 bomb 	 s 	 	.
it	is	 deep 	 er 	 	,	it	is	a	process	,	it	is	 a 	 cute 	 	 aware 	 ness 	 	that	we	are	all	 utter 	 ly 	 	inter	-	bended	,	and	one	action	by	one	 be 	 ing 	 	in	one	 tin 	 y 	 	town	 ha 	 s 	 	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	 every 	 where 	 	.
real	security	is	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	 toler 	 ate 	 	 myster 	 y 	 	,	 complex 	 ity 	 	,	 ambigu 	 ity 	 	,	but	 hung 	 er 	 ing 	 	for	them	and	 on 	 ly 	 	 trust 	 ing 	 	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	when	they	are	present	.
 some 	 thing 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	when	i	 beg 	 an 	 	 travel 	 ing 	 	in	v	-	day	,	eight	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.	i	got	lost	.
i	remember	 be 	 ing 	 	on	a	plane	going	from	kenya	to	south	africa	,	and	i	had	no	idea	where	i	was	.
i	did	n't	know	where	i	was	going	,	where	i	'd	come	from	,	and	i	 panic 	 ked 	 	.	i	had	a	total	 anxie 	 ty 	 	attack	.
and	then	i	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 real 	 ized 	 	that	it	 absolute 	 ly 	 	did	n't	matter	where	i	was	going	,	or	where	i	had	come	from	 be 	 cause 	 	we	are	all	 essential 	 ly 	 	 permanent 	 ly 	 	 dis 	 place 	 d 	 	people	.
all	of	us	are	 refuge 	 es 	 	.
we	come	from	 some 	 where 	 	and	we	are	 hope 	 fully 	 	 travel 	 ing 	 	all	the	time	,	moving	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	a	new	place	.
 free 	 dom 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	i	may	not	be	identified	 a 	 s 	 	any	one	group	,	but	that	i	can	visit	and	find	 my 	 self 	 	in	every	group	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	not	mean	that	i	do	n't	have	 value 	 s 	 	or	 belief 	 s 	 	,	but	it	 do 	 es 	 	mean	i	am	not	 hard 	 ened 	 	around	them	.
i	do	not	use	them	 a 	 s 	 	 weapon 	 s 	 	.
in	the	 share 	 d 	 	future	,	it	will	be	just	that	,	 share 	 d 	 	.
the	end	goal	will	[	be	]	 be 	 coming 	 	 vulner 	 able 	 	,	 real 	 izing 	 	the	place	of	our	 connect 	 ion 	 	to	one	 an 	 other 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 be 	 coming 	 	secure	,	in	control	and	 al 	 one 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
chris	anderson	:	and	how	are	you	 do 	 ing 	 	?	are	you	 exhaust 	 ed 	 	?
on	a	typical	day	,	do	you	wake	up	with	hope	or	gloom	?
eve	ensler	:	you	know	,	i	think	carl	jung	once	 s 	 aid 	 	that	in	order	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	the	 t 	 went 	 ieth 	 	century	,	we	have	to	live	with	two	 exist 	 ing 	 	 thought 	 s 	 	,	 oppos 	 ite 	 	 thought 	 s 	 	,	at	the	same	time	.
and	i	think	part	of	what	i	'm	 learn 	 ing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	process	is	that	one	must	allow	 one 	 self 	 	to	feel	grief	.
and	i	think	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	i	keep	 griev 	 ing 	 	,	and	 weep 	 ing 	 	,	and	then	moving	on	,	i	'm	fine	.
when	i	start	to	pretend	that	what	i	'm	 see 	 ing 	 	is	n't	 impact 	 ing 	 	me	,	and	is	n't	changing	my	heart	,	then	i	get	in	trouble	.	 be 	 cause 	 	when	you	 s 	 pend 	 	a	lot	of	time	going	from	place	to	place	,	country	to	country	,	and	city	to	city	,	the	degree	to	which	women	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	are	 viol 	 ated 	 	,	and	the	 epi 	 demic 	 	of	it	,	and	the	kind	of	 ordinari 	 ness 	 	of	it	,	is	so	 deva 	 stat 	 ing 	 	to	one	's	soul	that	you	have	to	take	the	time	,	or	i	have	to	take	the	time	now	,	to	process	that	.
ca	:	there	are	a	lot	of	 cause 	 s 	 	out	there	in	the	world	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	,	you	know	,	poverty	,	 sick 	 ness 	 	and	so	on	.	you	 s 	 pent 	 	eight	 year 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
why	 th 	 is 	 	one	?
ee	:	i	think	that	if	you	think	about	women	,	women	are	the	 prim 	 ary 	 	resource	of	the	planet	.	they	give	birth	,	we	come	from	them	,	they	are	 mother 	 s 	 	,	they	are	 vision 	 aries 	 	,	they	are	the	future	.	if	you	think	that	the	u.n.	now	 say 	 s 	 	that	one	out	of	three	women	on	the	planet	will	be	 rap 	 ed 	 	or	 beat 	 en 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 life 	 time 	 	,	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	 de 	 sec 	 ration 	 	of	the	 prim 	 ary 	 	resource	of	the	planet	,	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	place	where	we	come	from	,	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 parent 	 ing 	 	.
imagine	that	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	 rap 	 ed 	 	and	you	're	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	up	a	boy	child	.
how	 do 	 es 	 	it	impact	your	ability	to	work	,	or	envision	a	future	,	or	 thriv 	 e 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	just	 surviv 	 e 	 	?	what	i	 believ 	 e 	 	is	if	we	could	figure	out	how	to	make	women	safe	and	honor	women	,	it	would	be	parallel	or	equal	to	 honor 	 ing 	 	life	 it 	 self 	 	.
