i	just	heard	the	best	joke	about	bond	emeruwa	.
i	was	 hav 	 ing 	 	lunch	with	him	just	a	few	 minute 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	a	nigerian	journalist	 come 	 s 	 	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	will	 on 	 ly 	 	make	sense	if	you	've	ever	 watch 	 ed 	 	a	james	bond	movie	--	and	a	nigerian	journalist	 come 	 s 	 	up	to	him	and	 go 	 es 	 	,	``	aha	,	we	meet	 aga 	 in 	 	,	mr.	bond	!	``
it	was	great	.
so	,	i	've	got	a	little	sheet	of	paper	here	,	 most 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	nigerian	and	if	you	 leav 	 e 	 	me	 al 	 one 	 	,	i	'll	talk	for	like	two	 hour 	 s 	 	.
i	just	want	to	say	good	afternoon	,	good	 even 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	an	 in 	 credible 	 	few	 day 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 down 	 hill 	 	from	now	on	.	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	thank	emeka	and	chris	.
but	 al 	 so 	 	,	most	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	all	the	 in 	 visible 	 	people	 be 	 hind 	 	ted	that	you	just	see	 flit 	 ting 	 	around	the	whole	place	that	have	made	sort	of	 th 	 is 	 	space	for	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 divers 	 e 	 	and	 ro 	 bust 	 	conversation	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	in	the	audience	.
i	'm	a	writer	,	and	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	people	with	the	slide	 show 	 s 	 	and	 scientist 	 s 	 	and	 bank 	 ers 	 	,	and	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	a	bit
like	a	 gang 	 s 	 ta 	 	 rap 	 per 	 	at	a	bar	mitzvah	.
like	,	what	have	i	got	to	say	about	all	 th 	 is 	 	?
and	i	was	 watch 	 ing 	 	jane	[	goodall	]	 yester 	 day 	 	,	and	i	thought	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	great	,	and	i	was	 watch 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	 slide 	 s 	 	of	the	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	,	and	i	thought	,	``	 w 	 ow 	 	.	what	if	a	chimpanzee	could	talk	,	you	know	?	what	would	it	say	?	``
my	first	thought	was	,	``	well	,	you	know	,	there	's	george	bush	.	``
but	then	i	thought	,	``	why	be	rude	to	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	?	``
i	guess	there	 go 	 es 	 	my	green	card	.
there	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	lot	of	talk	about	narrative	in	africa	.
and	what	's	 be 	 come 	 	 increasing 	 ly 	 	clear	to	me	is	that	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	news	 st 	 ories 	 	about	africa	;	we	're	not	 re 	 ally 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	african	 narrative 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	make	a	 distinct 	 ion 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	the	news	is	 any 	 thing 	 	to	go	by	,	40	percent	of	americans	ca	n't	--	either	ca	n't	afford	health	 insur 	 ance 	 	or	have	the	most	 in 	 ad 	 equate 	 	health	 insur 	 ance 	 	,	and	have	a	 p 	 resident 	 	who	,	 de 	 spite 	 	the	protest	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	his	 citizen 	 s 	 	--	even	his	own	congress	--	 continu 	 es 	 	to	 prosecut 	 e 	 	a	 sense 	 less 	 	war	.
so	if	news	is	 any 	 thing 	 	to	go	by	,	the	u.s.	is	right	there	with	zimbabwe	,	right	?
which	it	is	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	,	is	it	?
and	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	war	,	my	girlfriend	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	great	t	-	shirt	that	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 bomb 	 ing 	 	for	peace	is	like	 fuck 	 ing 	 	for	 virgin 	 ity 	 	.	``
the	truth	is	,	 every 	 thing 	 	we	know	about	america	,	 every 	 thing 	 	americans	come	to	know	about	 be 	 ing 	 	american	,	is	n't	from	the	news	.
i	live	there	.
we	do	n't	go	home	at	the	end	of	the	day	and	think	,	``	well	,	i	 re 	 ally 	 	know	who	i	am	now	 be 	 cause 	 	the	wall	street	journal	 say 	 s 	 	that	the	stock	 ex 	 change 	 	closed	at	 th 	 is 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 point 	 s 	 	.	``
what	we	know	about	how	to	be	who	we	are	 come 	 s 	 	from	 st 	 ories 	 	.
it	 come 	 s 	 	from	the	 novel 	 s 	 	,	the	 movie 	 s 	 	,	the	fashion	 magazine 	 s 	 	.
it	 come 	 s 	 	from	popular	culture	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	it	's	the	 agent 	 s 	 	of	our	 imagin 	 ation 	 	who	 re 	 ally 	 	shape	who	we	are	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 import 	 ant 	 	to	remember	,	 be 	 cause 	 	in	africa	the	 complic 	 ated 	 	 question 	 s 	 	we	want	to	ask	about	what	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	from	the	rock	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	the	san	people	,	through	the	sundiata	 epic 	 s 	 	of	mali	,	to	modern	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	 liter 	 ature 	 	.
if	you	want	to	know	about	africa	,	read	our	 liter 	 ature 	 	--	and	not	just	``	 thing 	 s 	 	fall	 a 	 part 	 	,	``	 be 	 cause 	 	that	would	be	like	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	i	've	read	'	gone	with	the	wind	'	and	so	i	know	 every 	 thing 	 	about	america	.	``
that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
there	's	a	poem	by	jack	gilbert	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	 for 	 gotten 	 	dialect	of	the	heart	.	``
he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	when	the	sumerian	 table 	 ts 	 	 we 	 re 	 	first	 transl 	 ated 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	thought	to	be	business	 record 	 s 	 	.

my	love	is	like	twelve	ethiopian	 goat 	 s 	 	 stand 	 ing 	 	still	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	light	.

 giraffe 	 s 	 	are	 th 	 is 	 	 desir 	 e 	 	in	the	dark	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	 import 	 ant 	 	.
it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	misreading	is	 re 	 ally 	 	the	chance	for	 complic 	 ation 	 	and	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
the	first	igbo	 b 	 ible 	 	was	 transl 	 ated 	 	from	english	in	about	the	1800s	by	bishop	crowther	,	who	was	a	yoruba	.
and	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	know	igbo	is	a	 ton 	 al 	 	language	,	and	so	they	'll	say	the	word	``	igwe	``	and	``	igwe	``	:	same	 spell 	 ing 	 	,	one	 mean 	 s 	 	``	sky	``	or	``	heaven	,	``	and	one	 mean 	 s 	 	``	 bi 	 cycle 	 	``	or	``	iron	.	``
so	``	god	is	in	heaven	 surround 	 ed 	 	by	his	 angel 	 s 	 	``	was	 transl 	 ated 	 	 a 	 s 	 	--	[	igbo	]	.	and	for	some	reason	,	in	cameroon	,	when	they	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	 transl 	 ate 	 	the	 b 	 ible 	 	 in 	 to 	 	cameroonian	patois	,	they	chose	the	igbo	version	.
and	i	'm	not	going	to	give	you	the	patois	 transl 	 ation 	 	;	i	'm	going	to	make	it	standard	english	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	,	it	 end 	 s 	 	up	 a 	 s 	 	``	god	is	on	a	 bi 	 cycle 	 	with	his	 angel 	 s 	 	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	good	,	 be 	 cause 	 	language	complicates	 thing 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	we	often	think	that	language	 mirror 	 s 	 	the	world	in	which	we	live	,	and	i	find	that	's	not	true	.
the	language	 actual 	 ly 	 	 make 	 s 	 	the	world	in	which	we	live	.
language	is	not	--	i	mean	,	 thing 	 s 	 	do	n't	have	any	 mut 	 able 	 	value	by	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	;	we	 a 	 scribe 	 	them	a	value	.
and	language	ca	n't	be	 under 	 stood 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	 abstract 	 ion 	 	.
it	can	 on 	 ly 	 	be	 under 	 stood 	 	in	the	 con 	 text 	 	of	story	,	and	 every 	 thing 	 	,	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	story	.
and	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	remember	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	we	do	n't	,	then	we	 be 	 come 	 	ahistorical	.
we	've	had	a	lot	of	--	a	 para 	 de 	 	of	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	here	.
but	these	are	not	new	to	africa	.
nigeria	got	 it 	 s 	 	 in 	 depend 	 ence 	 	in	1960	.
the	first	time	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	for	 in 	 depend 	 ence 	 	was	 discuss 	 ed 	 	was	in	1922	,	 follow 	 ing 	 	the	aba	women	's	market	 riot 	 s 	 	.
in	1967	,	in	the	middle	of	the	biafran	-	nigerian	civil	war	,	dr.	njoku	-	obi	 invent 	 ed 	 	the	cholera	 vaccin 	 e 	 	.
so	,	you	know	,	the	thing	is	to	remember	that	 be 	 cause 	 	 other 	 wise 	 	,	10	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	,	we	'll	be	back	here	 try 	 ing 	 	to	tell	 th 	 is 	 	story	 aga 	 in 	 	.
so	,	what	it	 say 	 s 	 	to	me	then	is	that	it	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	--	the	problem	is	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	the	 st 	 ories 	 	that	are	 be 	 ing 	 	told	or	which	 st 	 ories 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	told	,
the	problem	 re 	 ally 	 	is	the	 term 	 s 	 	of	 human 	 ity 	 	that	we	're	 will 	 ing 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	to	 complic 	 ate 	 	every	story	,	and	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	what	it	's	all	about	.
let	me	tell	you	a	nigerian	joke	.
well	,	it	's	just	a	joke	,	 any 	 way 	 	.
so	there	's	tom	,	 d 	 ick 	 	and	harry	and	they	're	 work 	 ing 	 	construction	.
and	tom	 open 	 s 	 	up	his	lunch	box	and	there	's	rice	in	it	,
and	he	 go 	 es 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	rant	about	,	``	twenty	 year 	 s 	 	,	my	wife	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 pack 	 ing 	 	rice	for	lunch	.
if	she	 do 	 es 	 	it	 aga 	 in 	 	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	,	i	'm	going	to	throw	 my 	 self 	 	off	 th 	 is 	 	building	and	kill	 my 	 self 	 	.	``
and	 d 	 ick 	 	and	harry	repeat	 th 	 is 	 	.
the	next	day	,	tom	 open 	 s 	 	his	lunchbox	,	there	's	rice	,	so	he	 throw 	 s 	 	 him 	 self 	 	off	and	 kill 	 s 	 	 him 	 self 	 	,	and	tom	,	 d 	 ick 	 	and	harry	follow	.
and	now	the	inquest	--	you	know	,	tom	's	wife	and	 d 	 ick 	 	's	wife	are	distraught	.
they	 wish 	 ed 	 	they	'd	not	 pack 	 ed 	 	rice	.
but	harry	's	wife	is	 con 	 fused 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	,	harry	had	 be 	 en 	 	 pack 	 ing 	 	his	own	lunch	for	20	 year 	 s 	 	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	 seem 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 innoc 	 ent 	 	joke	,	when	i	heard	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	child	in	nigeria	,	was	told	about	igbo	,	yoruba	and	hausa	,	with	the	hausa	 be 	 ing 	 	harry	.
so	what	 seem 	 s 	 	like	an	 ec 	 centric 	 	if	tragic	joke	about	harry	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	way	to	spread	ethnic	hatred	.
my	father	was	educated	in	cork	,	in	the	university	of	cork	,	in	the	'50s	.
in	fact	,	every	time	i	read	in	ireland	,	people	get	me	all	 mistak 	 en 	 	and	they	say	,	``	oh	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	chris	o'barney	from	cork	.	``
but	he	was	 al 	 so 	 	in	oxford	in	the	'50s	,	and	yet	growing	up	 a 	 s 	 	a	child	in	nigeria	,	my	father	used	to	say	to	me	,	``	you	must	never	eat	or	drink	in	a	yoruba	person	's	house	 be 	 cause 	 	they	will	poison	you	.	``
 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	'd	known	my	father	,	you	would	've	 want 	 ed 	 	to	poison	him	too	.
so	i	was	born	in	1966	,	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	biafran	-	nigerian	civil	war	,	and	the	war	 end 	 ed 	 	after	three	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	i	was	growing	up	in	school	and	the	federal	government	did	n't	want	us	taught	about	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	the	war	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	thought	it	 prob 	 ably 	 	would	make	us	generate	a	new	generation	of	 rebel 	 s 	 	.
so	i	had	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 invent 	 ive 	 	teacher	,	a	pakistani	muslim	,	who	 want 	 ed 	 	to	teach	us	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	what	he	did	was	to	teach	us	jewish	 holo 	 caus 	 t 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	and	so	 huddl 	 ed 	 	around	 book 	 s 	 	with	 photograph 	 s 	 	of	people	in	auschwitz	,
i	 learn 	 ed 	 	the	 melanc 	 hol 	 ic 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	my	people	through	the	 melanc 	 hol 	 ic 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 an 	 other 	 	people	.
i	mean	,	picture	 th 	 is 	 	--	 re 	 ally 	 	picture	 th 	 is 	 	.
a	pakistani	muslim	 teach 	 ing 	 	jewish	 holo 	 caus 	 t 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	to	young	igbo	children	.
story	is	 power 	 ful 	 	.
story	is	fluid	and	it	 belong 	 s 	 	to	 no 	 body 	 	.
and	it	should	come	 a 	 s 	 	no	surprise	that	my	first	novel	at	16	was	about	neo	-	nazis	taking	over	nigeria	to	institute	the	fourth	reich	.
it	 make 	 s 	 	perfect	sense	.
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	to	blow	up	 strat 	 egic 	 	 target 	 s 	 	and	take	over	the	country	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	foiled	by	a	nigerian	james	bond	 call 	 ed 	 	coyote	williams	,	and	a	jewish	nazi	hunter	.
and	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	over	four	 continent 	 s 	 	.
and	when	the	book	came	out	,	i	was	 herald 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	africa	's	answer	to	frederick	forsyth	,	which	is	a	 dub 	 ious 	 	honor	at	best	.
but	 al 	 so 	 	,	the	book	was	 launch 	 ed 	 	in	time	for	me	to	be	 accus 	 ed 	 	of	 construct 	 ing 	 	the	 blue 	 print 	 	for	a	foiled	coup	attempt	.
so	at	18	,	i	was	 bond 	 ed 	 	off	to	 pri 	 son 	 	in	nigeria	.
i	grew	up	 ver 	 y 	 	 privilege 	 d 	 	,	and	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	talk	about	privilege	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	do	n't	talk	about	it	here	.
a	lot	of	us	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 privilege 	 d 	 	.
i	grew	up	--	 serv 	 ants 	 	,	 car 	 s 	 	,	 tele 	 vision 	 s 	 	,	all	that	stuff	.
my	story	of	nigeria	growing	up	was	 ver 	 y 	 	different	from	the	story	i	 en 	 counter 	 ed 	 	in	 pri 	 son 	 	,	and	i	had	no	language	for	it	.
i	was	 complete 	 ly 	 	 terr 	 ified 	 	,	 complete 	 ly 	 	broken	,	and	 ke 	 pt 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	find	a	new	language	,	a	new	way	to	make	sense	of	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
six	 month 	 s 	 	after	that	,	with	no	 explan 	 ation 	 	,	they	let	me	go	.
now	for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	have	 s 	 een 	 	me	at	the	buffet	 table 	 s 	 	know	that	it	was	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	 cost 	 ing 	 	them	too	much	to	feed	me	.
but	i	mean	,	i	grew	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	privilege	,	and	not	just	me	--	 million 	 s 	 	of	nigerians	grew	up	with	 book 	 s 	 	and	 lib 	 r 	 aries 	 	.
in	fact	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	last	night	about	how	all	of	the	 s 	 team 	 y 	 	 novel 	 s 	 	of	harold	robbins	had	 d 	 one 	 	more	for	 s 	 ex 	 	education	of	horny	 teen 	 age 	 	 boy 	 s 	 	in	africa	than	any	 s 	 ex 	 	education	 program 	 s 	 	ever	had	.
all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	are	gone	.
we	are	 squander 	 ing 	 	the	most	 valu 	 able 	 	resource	we	have	on	 th 	 is 	 	continent	:	the	 valu 	 able 	 	resource	of	the	 imagin 	 ation 	 	.
in	the	film	,	``	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	in	april	``	by	raoul	peck	,	idris	elba	is	 poise 	 d 	 	in	a	scene	with	his	machete	raised	,	and	he	's	 be 	 ing 	 	 force 	 d 	 	by	a	crowd	to	chop	up	his	best	friend	--	fellow	rwandan	 arm 	 y 	 	officer	,	albeit	a	tutsi	--	 play 	 ed 	 	by	fraser	james	.
and	fraser	's	on	his	 knee 	 s 	 	,	 arm 	 s 	 	 ti 	 ed 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	his	back	,	and	he	's	 cry 	 ing 	 	.
he	's	sniveling	.
it	's	a	 pit 	 iful 	 	sight	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	we	watch	it	,	we	are	 a 	 shame 	 d 	 	.
and	we	want	to	say	to	idris	,	``	chop	him	up	.
shut	him	up	.	``
and	 a 	 s 	 	idris	 move 	 s 	 	,	fraser	 s 	 cream 	 s 	 	,	``	stop	!

idris	 pause 	 s 	 	,	then	he	 move 	 s 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	,	and	fraser	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 pleas 	 e 	 	!
 pleas 	 e 	 	stop	!	``
and	it	's	not	the	look	of	 horr 	 or 	 	and	terror	on	fraser	's	face	that	 stop 	 s 	 	idris	or	us	;	it	's	the	look	in	fraser	's	 eye 	 s 	 	.
it	's	one	that	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	do	n't	do	 th 	 is 	 	.

in	that	moment	,	fraser	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	am	lost	 al 	 ready 	 	,	but	not	you	...	not	you	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 re 	 de 	 mption 	 	we	can	all	 aspir 	 e 	 	to	.

the	question	is	,	how	do	i	balance	 narrative 	 s 	 	that	are	 wonder 	 ful 	 	with	 narrative 	 s 	 	of	 wound 	 s 	 	and	self	-	 loath 	 ing 	 	?
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 difficult 	 y 	 	that	i	face	.
i	am	 try 	 ing 	 	to	move	beyond	 politic 	 al 	 	rhetoric	to	a	place	of	 ethic 	 al 	 	 question 	 ing 	 	.
i	am	 ask 	 ing 	 	us	to	balance	the	idea	of	our	complete	 vulner 	 ability 	 	with	the	complete	 not 	 ion 	 	of	 transform 	 ation 	 	of	what	is	possible	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	young	middle	-	class	nigerian	activist	,	i	 launch 	 ed 	 	 my 	 self 	 	 a 	 long 	 	with	a	whole	generation	of	us	 in 	 to 	 	the	campaign	to	stop	the	government	.
and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	 million 	 s 	 	of	people	,	 with 	 out 	 	 question 	 ing 	 	my	right	to	do	so	,	to	go	up	against	the	government	.
and	i	 watch 	 ed 	 	them	 be 	 ing 	 	 lock 	 ed 	 	up	in	 pri 	 son 	 	and	tear	gassed	.
i	 just 	 ified 	 	it	,	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	cost	of	revolution	.
have	i	not	 my 	 self 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 imprison 	 ed 	 	?
have	i	not	 my 	 self 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 beat 	 en 	 	?	``
it	was	n't	 un 	 til 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	when	i	was	 imprison 	 ed 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	,	that	i	 under 	 stood 	 	the	real	meaning	of	torture	,	and	how	easy	your	 human 	 ity 	 	can	be	taken	from	you	,	for	the	time	i	was	 engag 	 ed 	 	in	war	,	righteous	,	righteous	war	.
excuse	me	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	i	can	stand	before	the	world	--	and	when	i	say	 th 	 is 	 	,	 transform 	 ation 	 	is	a	difficult	and	 s 	 low 	 	process	--
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	i	can	stand	before	the	world	and	say	,	``	my	name	is	chris	abani	.
i	have	 be 	 en 	 	human	six	 day 	 s 	 	,	but	 on 	 ly 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	.	``
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	good	thing	.
it	's	never	going	to	be	easy	.
there	are	no	 answer 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	was	 tell 	 ing 	 	rachel	from	google	earth	,	that	i	had	 challeng 	 ed 	 	my	 student 	 s 	 	in	america	--
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	do	n't	know	 any 	 thing 	 	about	africa	,	you	're	all	 idiot 	 s 	 	.	``
and	so	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	tell	me	about	africa	,	professor	abani	.	``
so	i	went	to	google	earth	and	 learn 	 ed 	 	about	africa	.
and	the	truth	be	told	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	it	,	is	n't	it	?
there	are	no	essential	africans	,	and	most	of	us	are	 a 	 s 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	 ignor 	 ant 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 every 	 one 	 	else	about	the	continent	we	come	from	,	and	yet	we	want	to	make	 pro 	 found 	 	 state 	 ments 	 	about	it	.
and	i	think	if	we	can	just	admit	that	we	're	all	 try 	 ing 	 	to	approximate	the	truth	of	our	own	 commun 	 ities 	 	,	it	will	make	for	a	much	more	 nuance 	 d 	 	and	a	much	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	conversation	.
i	want	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	we	can	be	agnostic	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	that	we	can	rise	above	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
when	i	was	10	,	i	read	james	baldwin	's	``	 an 	 other 	 	country	,	``	and	that	book	broke	me	.
not	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	 en 	 counter 	 ing 	 	 homo 	 sexual 	 	 s 	 ex 	 	and	love	for	the	first	time	,	but	 be 	 cause 	 	the	way	james	wrote	about	it	made	it	 im 	 possible 	 	for	me	to	attach	 other 	 ness 	 	to	it	.
``	here	,	``	jimmy	 s 	 aid 	 	.
``	here	is	love	,	all	of	it	.	``
the	fact	that	it	 happen 	 s 	 	in	``	 an 	 other 	 	country	``	 take 	 s 	 	you	 quit 	 e 	 	by	surprise	.
my	friend	ronald	gottesman	 say 	 s 	 	there	are	three	 kind 	 s 	 	of	people	in	the	world	:	 t 	 hose 	 	who	can	count	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	who	ca	n't	.
he	 al 	 so 	 	 say 	 s 	 	that	the	cause	of	all	our	trouble	is	the	belief	in	an	essential	,	 pur 	 e 	 	 ident 	 ity 	 	:	religious	,	ethnic	,	 historic 	 al 	 	,	 ideo 	 logical 	 	.
i	want	to	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	a	poem	by	yusef	komunyakaa	that	 speak 	 s 	 	to	 transform 	 ation 	 	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 o 	 de 	 	to	the	drum	,	``	and	i	'll	try	and	read	it	the	way	yusef	would	be	proud	to	hear	it	read	.
``	gazelle	,	i	 kill 	 ed 	 	you	for	your	skin	's	exquisite	touch	,	for	how	easy	it	is	to	be	 nail 	 ed 	 	to	a	board	weathered	raw	 a 	 s 	 	white	butcher	paper	.
last	night	i	heard	my	daughter	 pray 	 ing 	 	for	the	meat	here	at	my	feet	.
