so	for	the	past	year	and	a	half	,	my	team	at	push	pop	press	and	charlie	melcher	and	melcher	media	have	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	creating	the	first	feature	-	length	 inter 	 active 	 	book	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	our	choice	``	and	the	author	is	al	gore	.
it	's	the	 s 	 equ 	 el 	 	to	``	an	 in 	 convenient 	 	truth	,	``	and	it	 explore 	 s 	 	all	the	 solution 	 s 	 	that	will	solve	the	climate	crisis	.
the	book	 start 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	cover	.
 a 	 s 	 	the	 glob 	 e 	 	 spin 	 s 	 	,	we	can	see	our	location	,
and	we	can	open	the	book	and	 s 	 wipe 	 	through	the	 chapter 	 s 	 	to	 brow 	 s 	 e 	 	the	book	.
or	,	we	can	scroll	through	the	 page 	 s 	 	at	the	bottom	.
and	if	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	zoom	 in 	 to 	 	a	page	,	we	can	just	open	it	up	.
and	 any 	 thing 	 	you	see	in	the	book	,	you	can	pick	up	with	two	 finger 	 s 	 	and	lift	off	the	page	and	open	up	.
and	if	you	want	to	go	back	and	read	the	book	 aga 	 in 	 	,	you	just	fold	it	back	up	and	put	it	back	on	the	page	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	 work 	 s 	 	the	same	way	;	you	pick	it	up	and	pop	it	open	.
al	gore	:	i	consider	 my 	 self 	 	among	the	 major 	 ity 	 	who	look	at	 wind 	 mill 	 s 	 	and	feel	they	're	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 add 	 ition 	 	to	the	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	.
 mi 	 ke 	 	matas	:	and	so	 through 	 out 	 	the	whole	book	,	al	gore	will	walk	you	through	and	explain	the	 photo 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	photo	,	you	can	you	can	even	see	on	an	 inter 	 active 	 	map	.
zoom	 in 	 to 	 	it	and	see	where	it	was	taken	.
and	 through 	 out 	 	the	book	,	there	's	over	an	hour	of	 document 	 ary 	 	 foot 	 age 	 	and	 inter 	 active 	 	 anim 	 ations 	 	.
so	you	can	open	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
ag	:	most	modern	wind	 turbine 	 s 	 	consist	of	a	large	...
mm	:	it	 start 	 s 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	.
and	while	it	's	 play 	 ing 	 	,	we	can	pinch	and	peak	back	at	the	page	,	and	the	movie	 keep 	 s 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	.
or	we	can	zoom	out	to	the	table	of	 content 	 s 	 	,	and	the	video	 keep 	 s 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	.
but	one	of	the	 cool 	 est 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	book	are	the	 inter 	 active 	 	 info 	 graphic 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	one	 show 	 s 	 	the	wind	potential	all	around	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
but	 in 	 stead 	 	of	just	 show 	 ing 	 	us	the	information	,	we	can	take	our	finger	and	explore	,	and	see	,	state	by	state	,	 exact 	 ly 	 	how	much	wind	potential	there	is	.
we	can	do	the	same	for	 geo 	 thermal 	 	energy	and	solar	power	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	my	 favor 	 ites 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 show 	 s 	 	...
when	the	wind	is	 blow 	 ing 	 	,	any	excess	energy	coming	from	the	 wind 	 mill 	 	is	 divert 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 batt 	 ery 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	the	wind	 start 	 s 	 	 dy 	 ing 	 	down	,	any	excess	energy	will	be	 divert 	 ed 	 	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	house	--	the	 light 	 s 	 	never	go	out	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	whole	book	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	just	run	on	the	ipad	.
it	 al 	 so 	 	 run 	 s 	 	on	the	iphone	.
and	so	you	can	start	 read 	 ing 	 	on	your	ipad	in	your	living	room	and	then	pick	up	where	you	left	off	on	the	iphone	.
and	it	 work 	 s 	 	the	exact	same	way	.
you	can	pinch	 in 	 to 	 	any	page	.
open	it	up	.
