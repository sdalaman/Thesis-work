evolution	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	 pe 	 rennial 	 	 top 	 ic 	 	here	at	the	ted	 con 	 ference 	 	,	but	i	want	to	give	you	 to 	 day 	 	one	doctor	's	take	on	the	subject	.
the	great	20th	-	century	 genetic 	 ist 	 	,	_UNK_	_UNK_	,	who	was	 al 	 so 	 	a	_UNK_	in	the	russian	orthodox	church	,	once	wrote	an	essay	that	he	titled	``	 noth 	 ing 	 	in	biology	 make 	 s 	 	sense	 ex 	 cept 	 	in	the	light	of	evolution	.	``	now	if	you	are	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	who	 do 	 es 	 	not	accept	the	evidence	for	 bio 	 logical 	 	evolution	,	 th 	 is 	 	would	be	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	time	to	turn	off	your	 hear 	 ing 	 	aid	,	take	out	your	personal	 communication 	 s 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	--	i	give	you	 per 	 mission 	 	--	and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	take	 an 	 other 	 	look	at	kathryn	schultz	's	book	on	 be 	 ing 	 	wrong	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	in	the	rest	of	 th 	 is 	 	talk	is	going	to	make	any	sense	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	to	you	.
but	if	you	do	accept	 bio 	 logical 	 	evolution	,	consider	 th 	 is 	 	:	is	it	just	about	the	past	,	or	is	it	about	the	future	?
 do 	 es 	 	it	 app 	 ly 	 	to	 other 	 s 	 	,	or	 do 	 es 	 	it	 app 	 ly 	 	to	us	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	look	at	the	tree	of	life	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	picture	,	i	've	put	a	bush	with	a	center	 branch 	 ing 	 	out	in	all	 direction 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	look	at	the	 edge 	 s 	 	of	the	tree	of	life	,	every	 exist 	 ing 	 	species	at	the	 tip 	 s 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 branch 	 es 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 succeed 	 ed 	 	in	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 term 	 s 	 	:	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 surviv 	 ed 	 	;	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 demonst 	 rated 	 	a	 fit 	 ness 	 	to	 it 	 s 	 	environment	.
the	human	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	branch	,	way	out	on	one	end	,	is	,	of	course	,	the	one	that	we	are	most	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	.
we	branch	off	of	a	common	 ance 	 s 	 tor 	 	to	modern	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	about	six	or	eight	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
in	the	 inter 	 val 	 	,	there	have	 be 	 en 	 	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	20	or	25	different	species	of	 hominid 	 s 	 	.
some	have	come	and	gone	.
we	have	 be 	 en 	 	here	for	about	130,000	 year 	 s 	 	.
it	may	seem	like	we	're	 quit 	 e 	 	remote	from	other	 part 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	tree	of	life	,	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	for	the	most	part	,	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	 machine 	 ry 	 	of	our	 cell 	 s 	 	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	the	same	.
do	you	 real 	 ize 	 	that	we	can	take	advantage	and	 command 	 eer 	 	the	 machine 	 ry 	 	of	a	common	 bacter 	 ium 	 	to	produce	the	protein	of	human	insulin	used	to	treat	 diabetic 	 s 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	like	human	insulin	;	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	same	protein	that	is	 chemical 	 ly 	 	 in 	 distinguish 	 able 	 	from	what	 come 	 s 	 	out	of	your	 pan 	 cre 	 a 	 s 	 	.
and	 s 	 peaking 	 	of	bacteria	,	do	you	 real 	 ize 	 	that	each	of	us	 car 	 ries 	 	in	our	gut	more	bacteria	than	there	are	 cell 	 s 	 	in	the	rest	of	our	body	?
 may 	 be 	 	10	 time 	 s 	 	more	.
i	mean	think	of	it	,	when	antonio	damasio	 ask 	 s 	 	about	your	self	-	image	,	do	you	think	about	the	bacteria	?
our	gut	is	a	 wonder 	 fully 	 	hospitable	environment	for	 t 	 hose 	 	bacteria	.
it	's	warm	,	it	's	dark	,	it	's	moist	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	cozy	.
and	you	're	going	to	provide	all	the	nutrition	that	they	could	possibly	want	with	no	effort	on	 the 	 ir 	 	part	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	like	an	easy	street	for	bacteria	,	with	the	 occasion 	 al 	 	 interrupt 	 ion 	 	of	the	 un 	 intend 	 ed 	 	 force 	 d 	 	rush	to	the	exit	.
but	 other 	 wise 	 	,	you	are	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	environment	for	 t 	 hose 	 	bacteria	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	they	are	essential	to	your	life	.
they	help	in	the	 digest 	 ion 	 	of	essential	 nutrient 	 s 	 	,
and	they	protect	you	against	certain	 disease 	 s 	 	.
but	what	will	come	in	the	future	?
are	we	at	some	kind	of	 evolution 	 ary 	 	equipoise	 a 	 s 	 	a	species	?
or	,	are	we	destined	to	 be 	 come 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	different	--	 some 	 thing 	 	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	even	better	 adapt 	 ed 	 	to	the	environment	?
now	let	's	take	a	step	back	in	time	to	the	big	bang	,	14	billion	 year 	 s 	 	ago	--	the	earth	,	the	solar	system	,	about	four	and	a	half	billion	 year 	 s 	 	--	the	first	 sign 	 s 	 	of	proto	-	life	,	 may 	 be 	 	three	to	four	billion	 year 	 s 	 	ago	on	earth	--	the	first	multi	-	celled	 organism 	 s 	 	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	800	or	a	billion	 year 	 s 	 	ago	--	and	then	the	human	species	,	 final 	 ly 	 	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	in	the	last	130,000	 year 	 s 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	vast	 un 	 finish 	 ed 	 	 sym 	 phony 	 	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	life	on	earth	is	like	a	brief	measure	;	the	animal	 king 	 dom 	 	,	like	a	single	measure	;	and	human	life	,	a	small	grace	note	.
that	was	us	.
that	 al 	 so 	 	 constitute 	 s 	 	the	 entertain 	 ment 	 	 port 	 ion 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	talk	,	so	i	hope	you	 enjoy 	 ed 	 	it	.
now	when	i	was	a	 fresh 	 man 	 	in	college	,	i	took	my	first	biology	class	.
i	was	 fascinate 	 d 	 	by	the	 e 	 leg 	 ance 	 	and	 beaut 	 y 	 	of	biology	.
i	 be 	 came 	 	 ena 	 mor 	 ed 	 	of	the	power	of	evolution	,	and	i	 real 	 ized 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	fundamental	:	in	most	of	the	 exist 	 ence 	 	of	life	in	single	-	celled	 organism 	 s 	 	,	each	cell	 simpl 	 y 	 	 divide 	 s 	 	,	and	all	of	the	genetic	energy	of	that	cell	is	carried	on	in	both	daughter	 cell 	 s 	 	.
but	at	the	time	multi	-	celled	 organism 	 s 	 	come	 on 	 line 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	start	to	change	.
sexual	 re 	 production 	 	 enter 	 s 	 	the	picture	.
and	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	with	the	 introduc 	 tion 	 	of	sexual	 re 	 production 	 	that	 pass 	 es 	 	on	the	genome	,	the	rest	of	the	body	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 expend 	 able 	 	.
in	fact	,	you	could	say	that	the	 inevit 	 ability 	 	of	the	death	of	our	bodies	 enter 	 s 	 	in	 evolution 	 ary 	 	time	at	the	same	moment	 a 	 s 	 	sexual	 re 	 production 	 	.
now	i	have	to	confess	,	when	i	was	a	college	 under 	 graduate 	 	,	i	thought	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	 s 	 ex 	 	/	death	,	 s 	 ex 	 	/	death	,	death	for	 s 	 ex 	 	--	it	 seem 	 ed 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	 reason 	 able 	 	at	the	time	,	but	with	each	 pass 	 ing 	 	year	,	i	've	come	to	have	increasing	 doubt 	 s 	 	.
i	've	come	to	understand	the	 sentiment 	 s 	 	of	george	 burn 	 s 	 	,	who	was	 perform 	 ing 	 	still	in	las	vegas	well	 in 	 to 	 	his	90s	.
and	one	night	,	there	's	a	knock	at	his	hotel	room	door	.
he	 answer 	 s 	 	the	door	.
 stand 	 ing 	 	before	him	is	a	 gorge 	 ous 	 	,	_UNK_	clad	_UNK_	.
she	 look 	 s 	 	at	him	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	'm	here	for	super	 s 	 ex 	 	.	``
``	that	's	fine	,	``	 say 	 s 	 	george	,	``	i	'll	take	the	soup	.	``
i	came	to	 real 	 ize 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	physician	,	that	i	was	 work 	 ing 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	a	goal	which	was	different	from	the	goal	of	evolution	--	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	 contradict 	 ory 	 	,	just	different	.
i	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	preserve	the	body	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	keep	us	 health 	 y 	 	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 re 	 store 	 	health	from	disease	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	us	to	live	long	and	 health 	 y 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
evolution	is	all	about	 pass 	 ing 	 	on	the	genome	to	the	next	generation	,	 adapt 	 ing 	 	and	 surviv 	 ing 	 	through	generation	after	generation	.	from	an	 evolution 	 ary 	 	point	of	view	,	you	and	i	are	like	the	_UNK_	 rocket 	 s 	 	designed	to	 s 	 end 	 	the	genetic	 pay 	 load 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	next	level	of	orbit	and	then	drop	off	 in 	 to 	 	the	sea	.
i	think	we	would	all	understand	the	sentiment	that	 wood 	 y 	 	allen	 express 	 ed 	 	when	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	do	n't	want	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	 im 	 mortal 	 ity 	 	through	my	work	.
i	want	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	it	through	not	 dy 	 ing 	 	.	``	evolution	 do 	 es 	 	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	favor	the	 long 	 est 	 	-	lived	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 necess 	 arily 	 	favor	the	 big 	 gest 	 	or	the	 strong 	 est 	 	or	the	 fast 	 est 	 	,	and	not	even	the	 smart 	 est 	 	.
evolution	 favor 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 creature 	 s 	 	best	 adapt 	 ed 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	environment	.
that	is	the	sole	test	of	 surviv 	 al 	 	and	success	.
at	the	bottom	of	the	ocean	,	bacteria	that	are	_UNK_	and	can	 surviv 	 e 	 	at	the	 s 	 team 	 	vent	heat	that	would	 other 	 wise 	 	produce	,	if	fish	 we 	 re 	 	there	,	_UNK_	-	_UNK_	 cook 	 ed 	 	fish	,	 never 	 the 	 less 	 	,	have	 manage 	 d 	 	to	make	that	a	hospitable	environment	for	them	.
so	what	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	mean	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	look	back	at	what	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	evolution	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	we	think	about	the	place	 aga 	 in 	 	of	 human 	 s 	 	in	evolution	,	and	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	look	 a 	 head 	 	to	the	next	phase	,	i	would	say	that	there	are	a	number	of	 possibil 	 ities 	 	.
the	first	is	that	we	will	not	evolve	.
we	have	 reach 	 ed 	 	a	kind	of	equipoise	.
and	the	 reason 	 ing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	that	would	be	,	first	,	we	have	,	through	medicine	,	 manage 	 d 	 	to	preserve	a	lot	of	 gene 	 s 	 	that	would	 other 	 wise 	 	be	 select 	 ed 	 	out	and	be	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	from	the	population	.
and	 second 	 ly 	 	,	we	 a 	 s 	 	a	species	have	so	_UNK_	our	environment	that	we	have	 manage 	 d 	 	to	make	it	adapt	to	us	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	we	adapt	to	it	.
and	by	the	way	,	we	 im 	 migr 	 ate 	 	and	 circul 	 ate 	 	and	_UNK_	so	much	that	you	ca	n't	any	 long 	 er 	 	have	the	 isol 	 ation 	 	that	is	 necess 	 ary 	 	for	evolution	to	take	place	.
a	second	 possibil 	 ity 	 	is	that	there	will	be	evolution	of	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	kind	,	natural	,	 impose 	 d 	 	by	the	 force 	 s 	 	of	nature	.
and	the	argument	here	would	be	that	the	 wheel 	 s 	 	of	evolution	grind	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	,	but	they	are	 inexor 	 able 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	 isol 	 ation 	 	 go 	 es 	 	,	when	we	 a 	 s 	 	a	species	do	 colon 	 ize 	 	 di 	 stant 	 	 planet 	 s 	 	,	there	will	be	the	 isol 	 ation 	 	and	the	 environment 	 al 	 	 change 	 s 	 	that	could	produce	evolution	in	the	natural	way	.
but	there	's	a	third	 possibil 	 ity 	 	,	an	 ent 	 ic 	 ing 	 	,	 intrigu 	 ing 	 	and	 frighten 	 ing 	 	 possibil 	 ity 	 	.
i	call	it	neo	-	evolution	--	the	new	evolution	that	is	not	 simpl 	 y 	 	natural	,	but	 guide 	 d 	 	and	 chose 	 n 	 	by	us	 a 	 s 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	in	the	 choice 	 s 	 	that	we	will	make	.
now	how	could	 th 	 is 	 	come	about	?
how	could	it	be	possible	that	we	would	do	 th 	 is 	 	?
consider	,	first	,	the	 re 	 ality 	 	that	people	 to 	 day 	 	,	in	some	 culture 	 s 	 	,	are	making	 choice 	 s 	 	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 off 	 spring 	 	.
they	're	,	in	some	 culture 	 s 	 	,	 choos 	 ing 	 	to	have	more	 male 	 s 	 	than	 female 	 s 	 	.
it	's	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	good	for	the	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	but	it	's	what	the	individual	and	the	family	are	 choos 	 ing 	 	.
think	 al 	 so 	 	,	if	it	 we 	 re 	 	possible	ever	for	you	to	 choos 	 e 	 	,	not	 simpl 	 y 	 	to	 choos 	 e 	 	the	 s 	 ex 	 	of	your	child	,	but	for	you	in	your	body	to	make	the	genetic	 adjust 	 ments 	 	that	would	cure	or	prevent	 disease 	 s 	 	.
what	if	you	could	make	the	genetic	 change 	 s 	 	to	eliminate	diabetes	or	alzheimer	's	or	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	risk	of	cancer	or	eliminate	stroke	?
would	n't	you	want	to	make	 t 	 hose 	 	 change 	 s 	 	in	your	 gene 	 s 	 	?
if	we	look	 a 	 head 	 	,	these	kind	of	 change 	 s 	 	are	going	to	be	 increasing 	 ly 	 	possible	.
the	human	genome	project	 start 	 ed 	 	in	1990	,	and	it	took	13	 year 	 s 	 	.
it	cost	2.7	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
the	year	after	it	was	 finish 	 ed 	 	in	2004	,	you	could	do	the	same	job	for	20	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	three	to	four	 month 	 s 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	you	can	have	a	complete	sequence	of	the	three	billion	base	 pair 	 s 	 	in	the	human	genome	at	a	cost	of	about	20,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	and	in	the	space	of	about	a	week	.
it	wo	n't	be	 ver 	 y 	 	long	before	the	 re 	 ality 	 	will	be	the	1,000	-	dollar	human	genome	,	and	it	will	be	 increasing 	 ly 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	for	 every 	 one 	 	.
just	a	week	ago	,	the	national	academy	of	 engineer 	 ing 	 	 a 	 ward 	 ed 	 	 it 	 s 	 	draper	prize	to	francis	arnold	and	_UNK_	_UNK_	,	two	 scientist 	 s 	 	who	 in 	 dependent 	 ly 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	to	 encourag 	 e 	 	the	natural	process	of	evolution	to	work	 fast 	 er 	 	and	to	lead	to	 desir 	 able 	 	 protein 	 s 	 	in	a	more	efficient	way	--	what	frances	arnold	 call 	 s 	 	``	 direct 	 ed 	 	evolution	.	``	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	the	_UNK_	prize	was	 a 	 ward 	 ed 	 	to	the	scientist	shinya	yamanaka	for	his	research	in	which	he	took	an	adult	skin	cell	,	a	fibroblast	,	and	by	 manipul 	 ating 	 	just	four	 gene 	 s 	 	,	he	induced	that	cell	to	 re 	 vert 	 	to	a	_UNK_	stem	cell	--	a	cell	 potential 	 ly 	 	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 be 	 coming 	 	any	cell	in	your	body	.
these	 change 	 s 	 	are	coming	.
the	same	technology	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 produce 	 d 	 	the	human	insulin	in	bacteria	can	make	viruses	that	will	not	 on 	 ly 	 	protect	you	against	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	but	induce	 immun 	 ity 	 	against	other	viruses	.
 believ 	 e 	 	it	or	not	,	there	's	an	 experiment 	 al 	 	trial	going	on	with	 vaccin 	 e 	 	against	influenza	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	grown	in	the	 cell 	 s 	 	of	a	tobacco	plant	.
can	you	imagine	 some 	 thing 	 	good	coming	out	of	tobacco	?
these	are	all	 re 	 ality 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	and	[	in	]	the	future	,	will	be	_UNK_	possible	.
imagine	then	just	two	other	little	 change 	 s 	 	.
you	can	change	the	 cell 	 s 	 	in	your	body	,	but	what	if	you	could	change	the	 cell 	 s 	 	in	your	 off 	 spring 	 	?
what	if	you	could	change	the	 s 	 perm 	 	and	the	_UNK_	,	or	change	the	 new 	 ly 	 	 fertil 	 ized 	 	egg	,	and	give	your	 off 	 spring 	 	a	better	chance	at	a	 health 	 ier 	 	life	--	eliminate	the	diabetes	,	eliminate	the	_UNK_	,	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	risk	of	cancer	?
who	 do 	 es 	 	n't	want	 health 	 ier 	 	children	?
and	then	,	that	same	analytic	technology	,	that	same	engine	of	science	that	can	produce	the	 change 	 s 	 	to	prevent	disease	,	will	 al 	 so 	 	 en 	 able 	 	us	to	adopt	super	-	 attribut 	 es 	 	,	hyper	-	 cap 	 a 	 cities 	 	--	that	better	 memor 	 y 	 	.
why	not	have	the	quick	wit	of	a	ken	jennings	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	if	you	can	augment	it	with	the	next	generation	of	the	watson	machine	?
why	not	have	the	quick	twitch	muscle	that	will	 en 	 able 	 	you	to	run	 fast 	 er 	 	and	 long 	 er 	 	?
why	not	live	 long 	 er 	 	?
these	will	be	 ir 	 resist 	 ible 	 	.
and	when	we	are	at	a	position	where	we	can	pass	it	on	to	the	next	generation	,	and	we	can	adopt	the	 attribut 	 es 	 	we	want	,	we	will	have	 convert 	 ed 	 	old	-	style	evolution	 in 	 to 	 	neo	-	evolution	.
we	'll	take	a	process	that	 normal 	 ly 	 	might	 requir 	 e 	 	100,000	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	we	can	compress	it	down	to	a	thousand	 year 	 s 	 	--	and	 may 	 be 	 	even	in	the	next	100	 year 	 s 	 	.
these	are	 choice 	 s 	 	that	your	 grand 	 children 	 	,	or	 the 	 ir 	 	 grand 	 children 	 	,	are	going	to	have	before	them	.
will	we	use	these	 choice 	 s 	 	to	make	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	that	is	better	,	that	is	more	 success 	 ful 	 	,	that	is	 kind 	 er 	 	?
or	,	will	we	 select 	 ively 	 	 choos 	 e 	 	different	 attribut 	 es 	 	that	we	want	for	some	of	us	and	not	for	 other 	 s 	 	of	us	?
will	we	make	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	that	is	more	 bor 	 ing 	 	and	more	uniform	,	or	more	 ro 	 bust 	 	and	more	 versa 	 tile 	 	?
these	are	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 question 	 s 	 	that	we	will	have	to	face	.	and	most	 pro 	 found 	 ly 	 	of	all	,	will	we	ever	be	able	to	develop	the	 wis 	 dom 	 	,	and	to	inherit	the	 wis 	 dom 	 	,	that	we	'll	need	to	make	these	 choice 	 s 	 	 wise 	 ly 	 	?
for	better	or	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	and	 soon 	 er 	 	than	you	may	think	,	these	 choice 	 s 	 	will	be	up	to	us	.
