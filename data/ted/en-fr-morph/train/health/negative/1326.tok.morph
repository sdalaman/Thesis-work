cholera	was	 report 	 ed 	 	in	 ha 	 iti 	 	for	the	first	time	in	over	50	 year 	 s 	 	last	october	.
there	was	no	way	to	predict	how	far	it	would	spread	through	water	 suppli 	 es 	 	and	how	bad	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	would	get	.
and	not	 know 	 ing 	 	where	help	was	 need 	 ed 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 ensure 	 d 	 	that	help	was	in	short	supply	in	the	 area 	 s 	 	that	 need 	 ed 	 	it	most	.
we	've	gotten	good	at	 predict 	 ing 	 	and	 pre 	 par 	 ing 	 	for	 storm 	 s 	 	before	they	take	 innoc 	 ent 	 	 live 	 s 	 	and	cause	 ir 	 revers 	 ible 	 	damage	,	but	we	still	ca	n't	do	that	with	water	,	and	here	's	why	.
right	now	,	if	you	want	to	test	water	in	the	field	,	you	need	a	trained	technician	,	expensive	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	you	have	to	wait	about	a	day	for	chemical	 react 	 ions 	 	to	take	place	and	provide	 result 	 s 	 	.
it	's	too	 s 	 low 	 	to	get	a	picture	of	 condition 	 s 	 	on	the	ground	before	they	change	,	too	expensive	to	implement	in	all	the	 place 	 s 	 	that	 requir 	 e 	 	 test 	 ing 	 	.
and	it	 ignor 	 es 	 	the	fact	that	,	in	the	 mean 	 while 	 	,	people	still	need	to	drink	water	.
most	of	the	information	that	we	 collect 	 ed 	 	on	the	cholera	 out 	 break 	 	did	n't	come	from	 test 	 ing 	 	water	;	it	came	from	 form 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	which	 document 	 ed 	 	all	the	people	we	 fail 	 ed 	 	to	help	.
 count 	 less 	 	 live 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	by	 can 	 aries 	 	in	 coal 	 mine 	 s 	 	--	a	simple	and	 in 	 valu 	 able 	 	way	for	 min 	 ers 	 	to	know	 whet 	 her 	 	they	're	safe	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	inspired	by	that	 simpl 	 icity 	 	 a 	 s 	 	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	problem	with	some	of	the	most	 hard 	 work 	 ing 	 	and	 brilli 	 ant 	 	people	i	've	ever	known	.
we	think	there	's	a	 simpl 	 er 	 	solution	to	 th 	 is 	 	problem	--	one	that	can	be	used	by	people	who	face	 condition 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	 every 	 day 	 	.
it	's	in	 it 	 s 	 	early	 stage 	 s 	 	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	right	now	.
we	call	it	the	water	 can 	 ary 	 	.
it	's	a	fast	,	cheap	 de 	 vice 	 	that	 answer 	 s 	 	an	 import 	 ant 	 	question	:	is	 th 	 is 	 	water	 contami 	 nated 	 	?
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 requir 	 e 	 	any	special	training	.
and	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	chemical	 react 	 ions 	 	to	take	place	,	it	uses	light	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	there	's	no	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	chemical	 react 	 ions 	 	to	take	place	,	no	need	to	use	 re 	 agent 	 s 	 	that	can	run	out	and	no	need	to	be	an	expert	to	get	 action 	 able 	 	information	.
to	test	water	,	you	 simpl 	 y 	 	insert	a	 s 	 ample 	 	and	,	 with 	 in 	 	 second 	 s 	 	,	it	either	 dis 	 play 	 s 	 	a	red	light	,	 indic 	 ating 	 	 contami 	 nated 	 	water	,	or	a	green	light	,	 indic 	 ating 	 	the	 s 	 ample 	 	is	safe	.
 th 	 is 	 	will	make	it	possible	for	 any 	 one 	 	to	collect	life	-	saving	information	and	to	monitor	water	quality	 condition 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	 un 	 fold 	 	.
we	're	 al 	 so 	 	,	on	top	of	that	,	 integ 	 rating 	 	 wire 	 less 	 	 network 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	an	 afford 	 able 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	with	gps	and	gsm	.
what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	is	that	each	 read 	 ing 	 	can	be	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	 transmit 	 ted 	 	to	 serv 	 ers 	 	to	be	 ma 	 pped 	 	in	real	time	.
with	 en 	 ough 	 	 user 	 s 	 	,	 map 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	will	make	it	possible	to	take	 prevent 	 ive 	 	action	,	 contain 	 ing 	 	 hazard 	 s 	 	before	they	turn	 in 	 to 	 	 emerge 	 ncies 	 	that	take	 year 	 s 	 	to	 re 	 cover 	 	from	.
and	then	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	taking	 day 	 s 	 	to	disseminate	 th 	 is 	 	information	to	the	people	who	need	it	most	,	it	can	happen	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	.
we	've	 s 	 een 	 	how	 distribut 	 ed 	 	 network 	 s 	 	,	big	data	and	information	can	transform	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
i	think	it	's	time	for	us	to	 app 	 ly 	 	them	to	water	.
our	goal	over	the	next	year	is	to	get	water	 can 	 ary 	 	ready	for	the	field	and	to	open	-	source	the	 hard 	 ware 	 	so	that	 any 	 one 	 	can	 con 	 tribute 	 	to	the	 develop 	 ment 	 	and	the	 evalu 	 ation 	 	,	so	we	can	tackle	 th 	 is 	 	problem	together	.
thank	you	.
