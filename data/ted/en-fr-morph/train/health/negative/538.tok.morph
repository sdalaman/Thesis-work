so	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	i	get	 invit 	 ed 	 	to	give	weird	 talk 	 s 	 	.
i	got	 invit 	 ed 	 	to	speak	to	the	people	who	dress	up	in	big	 stuff 	 ed 	 	animal	 cost 	 ume 	 s 	 	to	perform	at	 s 	 port 	 ing 	 	 event 	 s 	 	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	i	could	n't	go	.
but	it	got	me	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	fact	that	these	 guy 	 s 	 	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	most	of	them	,	know	what	it	is	that	they	do	for	a	living	.
what	they	do	is	they	dress	up	 a 	 s 	 	 stuff 	 ed 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	and	entertain	people	at	 s 	 port 	 ing 	 	 event 	 s 	 	.
 short 	 ly 	 	after	that	i	got	 invit 	 ed 	 	to	speak	at	the	convention	of	the	people	who	make	balloon	 animal 	 s 	 	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	i	could	n't	go	.	but	it	's	a	 fasci 	 nating 	 	group	.	they	make	balloon	 animal 	 s 	 	.
there	is	a	big	 sch 	 ism 	 	between	the	 one 	 s 	 	who	make	 go 	 s 	 pel 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	and	porn	 animal 	 s 	 	,	but	--
they	do	a	lot	of	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	stuff	with	 balloon 	 s 	 	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	they	get	in	trouble	,	but	not	often	.
and	the	other	thing	about	these	 guy 	 s 	 	is	,	they	 al 	 so 	 	know	what	they	do	for	a	living	.
they	make	balloon	 animal 	 s 	 	.
but	what	do	we	do	for	a	living	?
what	 exact 	 ly 	 	to	the	people	 watch 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	do	every	day	?
and	i	want	to	 argu 	 e 	 	that	what	we	do	is	we	try	to	change	 every 	 thing 	 	.
that	we	try	to	find	a	piece	of	the	 stat 	 us 	 	quo	--	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 both 	 ers 	 	us	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 improv 	 ed 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	 itch 	 ing 	 	to	be	 change 	 d 	 	--	and	we	change	it	.
we	try	to	make	big	,	permanent	,	 import 	 ant 	 	change	.
but	we	do	n't	think	about	it	that	way	.
and	we	have	n't	 s 	 pent 	 	a	lot	of	time	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	what	that	process	is	like	.
and	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	it	for	a	couple	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	i	want	to	share	a	couple	 st 	 ories 	 	with	you	 to 	 day 	 	.
first	,	about	a	guy	named	nathan	winograd	.
nathan	was	the	number	two	person	at	the	san	francisco	spca	.
and	what	you	may	not	know	about	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	the	spca	is	,	it	was	 found 	 ed 	 	to	kill	 dog 	 s 	 	and	 cat 	 s 	 	.
cities	 g 	 ave 	 	them	a	 chart 	 er 	 	to	get	rid	of	the	 s 	 tray 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	on	the	street	and	destroy	them	.
in	a	typical	year	four	million	 dog 	 s 	 	and	 cat 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 kill 	 ed 	 	,	most	of	them	 with 	 in 	 	24	 hour 	 s 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 scoop 	 ed 	 	off	of	the	street	.
nathan	and	his	 bo 	 s 	 s 	 	saw	 th 	 is 	 	,
and	they	could	not	 toler 	 ate 	 	it	.
so	they	set	out	to	make	san	francisco	a	no	-	kill	city	:
create	an	entire	city	where	every	dog	and	cat	,	 un 	 less 	 	it	was	ill	or	 danger 	 ous 	 	,	would	be	 adopt 	 ed 	 	,	not	 kill 	 ed 	 	.
and	 every 	 one 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	it	was	 im 	 possible 	 	.
nathan	and	his	 bo 	 s 	 s 	 	went	to	the	city	council	to	get	a	change	in	the	 ordin 	 ance 	 	.	and	people	from	spcas	and	 human 	 e 	 	 shelter 	 s 	 	around	the	country	flew	to	san	francisco	to	 test 	 ify 	 	against	them	--	to	say	it	would	hurt	the	 move 	 ment 	 	and	it	was	 in 	 human 	 e 	 	.
they	 persist 	 ed 	 	.	and	nathan	went	 direct 	 ly 	 	to	the	community	.
he	 connect 	 ed 	 	with	people	who	 car 	 ed 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	:
 non 	 professional 	 s 	 	,	people	with	 pass 	 ion 	 	.
and	 with 	 in 	 	just	a	couple	 year 	 s 	 	,	san	francisco	 be 	 came 	 	the	first	no	-	kill	city	,
running	no	 defici 	 t 	 	,	 complete 	 ly 	 	 support 	 ed 	 	by	the	community	.
nathan	left	and	went	to	tompkins	 count 	 y 	 	,	new	york	--
a	place	 a 	 s 	 	different	from	san	francisco	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	be	and	still	be	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.	and	he	did	it	 aga 	 in 	 	.
he	went	from	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 glor 	 ified 	 	 dog 	 catch 	 er 	 	to	 complete 	 ly 	 	 transform 	 ing 	 	the	community	.
and	then	he	went	to	north	carolina	and	did	it	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	he	went	to	reno	and	he	did	it	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	when	i	think	about	what	nathan	did	,	and	when	i	think	about	what	people	here	do	,	i	think	about	 idea 	 s 	 	.
and	i	think	about	the	idea	that	creating	an	idea	,	 spread 	 ing 	 	an	idea	 ha 	 s 	 	a	lot	 be 	 hind 	 	it	.
i	do	n't	know	if	you	've	ever	 be 	 en 	 	to	a	jewish	 wed 	 d 	 ing 	 	,
but	what	they	do	is	,	they	take	a	light	bulb	and	they	 s 	 mash 	 	it	.
now	there	is	a	bunch	of	 reason 	 s 	 	for	that	,	and	 st 	 ories 	 	about	it	.
but	one	reason	is	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 indic 	 ates 	 	a	change	,	from	before	to	after	.
it	is	a	moment	in	time	.
and	i	want	to	 argu 	 e 	 	that	we	are	living	through	and	are	right	at	the	key	moment	of	a	change	in	the	way	 idea 	 s 	 	are	 create 	 d 	 	and	spread	and	 implement 	 ed 	 	.
we	 start 	 ed 	 	with	the	 factor 	 y 	 	idea	:
that	you	could	change	the	whole	world	if	you	had	an	efficient	 factor 	 y 	 	that	could	churn	out	change	.
we	then	went	to	the	tv	idea	,
that	 s 	 aid 	 	if	you	had	a	big	 en 	 ough 	 	 mouth 	 piece 	 	,	if	you	could	get	on	tv	 en 	 ough 	 	 time 	 s 	 	,	if	you	could	buy	 en 	 ough 	 	 ad 	 s 	 	,	you	could	win	.
and	now	we	're	in	 th 	 is 	 	new	model	of	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	,
where	the	way	we	make	change	is	not	by	using	money	or	power	to	lever	a	system	,	but	by	 lead 	 ing 	 	.
so	let	me	tell	you	about	the	three	 cycle 	 s 	 	.	the	first	one	is	the	 factor 	 y 	 	cycle	.
henry	ford	 come 	 s 	 	up	with	a	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	idea	.
it	 en 	 able 	 s 	 	him	to	hire	men	who	used	to	get	paid	50	 cent 	 s 	 	a	day	and	pay	them	five	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	day	.	 be 	 cause 	 	he	's	got	an	efficient	 en 	 ough 	 	 factor 	 y 	 	.
well	with	that	sort	of	advantage	you	can	churn	out	a	lot	of	 car 	 s 	 	.
you	can	make	a	lot	of	change	.	you	can	get	 road 	 s 	 	built	.
you	can	change	the	fabric	of	an	entire	country	.
that	the	 es 	 s 	 ence 	 	of	what	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	is	you	need	ever	-	 cheap 	 er 	 	labor	,	and	ever	-	 fast 	 er 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	.	and	the	problem	we	've	run	 in 	 to 	 	is	,	we	're	running	out	of	both	.
ever	-	 cheap 	 er 	 	labor	and	ever	-	 fast 	 er 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	.
so	we	shift	 gear 	 s 	 	for	a	minute	,	and	say	,	``	i	know	:	 tele 	 vision 	 	;
 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	.	push	push	.
take	a	good	idea	and	push	it	on	the	world	.
i	have	a	better	 mouse 	 trap 	 	.	and	if	i	can	just	get	 en 	 ough 	 	money	to	tell	 en 	 ough 	 	people	,	i	'll	sell	 en 	 ough 	 	.	``
and	you	can	build	an	entire	industry	on	that	.
if	 necess 	 ary 	 	you	can	put	 bab 	 ies 	 	in	your	 ad 	 s 	 	.
if	 necess 	 ary 	 	you	can	use	 bab 	 ies 	 	to	sell	other	stuff	.
and	if	 bab 	 ies 	 	do	n't	work	,	you	can	use	 doctor 	 s 	 	.
but	be	 care 	 ful 	 	.	 be 	 cause 	 	you	do	n't	want	to	get	an	 un 	 fortunate 	 	 juxta 	 position 	 	,	where	you	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	one	thing	 in 	 stead 	 	of	the	other	.
 th 	 is 	 	model	 requir 	 es 	 	you	to	act	like	the	king	,	like	the	person	in	the	front	of	the	room	 throw 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	to	the	 pe 	 on 	 s 	 	in	the	back	.
that	you	are	in	charge	,	and	you	're	going	to	tell	people	what	to	do	next	.
the	quick	little	 dia 	 gram 	 	of	it	is	,	you	're	up	here	,	and	you	are	 push 	 ing 	 	it	out	to	the	world	.
 th 	 is 	 	method	--	mass	 market 	 ing 	 	--	 requir 	 es 	 	average	 idea 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	going	to	the	 masse 	 s 	 	,	and	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	 ad 	 s 	 	.
what	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 spam 	 mer 	 s 	 	is	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	 hypno 	 tize 	 	 every 	 one 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 buy 	 ing 	 	our	idea	,
 hypno 	 tize 	 	 every 	 one 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 don 	 ating 	 	to	our	cause	,
 hypno 	 tize 	 	 every 	 one 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 vot 	 ing 	 	for	our	 candid 	 ate 	 	.
and	,	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	so	well	 any 	 more 	 	either	.
but	there	is	good	news	around	the	corner	--	 re 	 ally 	 	good	news	.
i	call	it	the	idea	of	 tribe 	 s 	 	.
what	 tribe 	 s 	 	are	,	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 con 	 cept 	 	that	 go 	 es 	 	back	50,000	 year 	 s 	 	.
it	's	about	 lead 	 ing 	 	and	 connect 	 ing 	 	people	and	 idea 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	people	have	 want 	 ed 	 	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
 lot 	 s 	 	of	people	are	used	to	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	spiritual	tribe	,	or	a	church	tribe	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	work	tribe	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	community	tribe	.
but	now	,	 thank 	 s 	 	to	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	 thank 	 s 	 	to	the	explosion	of	mass	media	,	 thank 	 s 	 	to	a	lot	of	other	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 bubb 	 ling 	 	through	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	around	the	world	,	 tribe 	 s 	 	are	 every 	 where 	 	.
the	 inter 	 net 	 	was	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	 homogen 	 ize 	 	 every 	 one 	 	by	 connect 	 ing 	 	us	all	.
 in 	 stead 	 	what	it	's	 allow 	 ed 	 	is	 s 	 ilo 	 s 	 	of	interest	.
so	you	've	got	the	red	-	hat	 lad 	 ies 	 	over	here	.
you	've	got	the	red	-	hat	 tri 	 athlete 	 s 	 	over	there	.
you	've	got	the	 organize 	 d 	 	 arm 	 ies 	 	over	here	.
you	've	got	the	 dis 	 organize 	 d 	 	 rebel 	 s 	 	over	here	.
you	've	got	people	in	white	 hat 	 s 	 	making	food	.
and	people	in	white	 hat 	 s 	 	 s 	 ailing 	 	 boat 	 s 	 	.
the	point	is	that	you	can	find	ukrainian	folk	 danc 	 ers 	 	and	connect	with	them	,
 be 	 cause 	 	you	want	to	be	 connect 	 ed 	 	.
that	people	on	the	 fringe 	 s 	 	can	find	each	other	,	connect	and	go	 some 	 where 	 	.
every	town	that	 ha 	 s 	 	a	volunteer	fire	 depart 	 ment 	 	 understand 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	way	of	 think 	 ing 	 	.
now	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	legitimate	non	-	photoshopped	photo	.
people	i	know	who	are	 fire 	 men 	 	told	me	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 un 	 common 	 	.	and	that	what	 fire 	 men 	 	do	to	train	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	is	they	take	a	house	that	is	going	to	be	torn	down	,	and	they	burn	it	down	 in 	 stead 	 	,	and	practice	 put 	 ting 	 	it	out	.
but	they	 al 	 ways 	 	stop	and	take	a	picture	.
you	know	the	pirate	tribe	is	a	 fasci 	 nating 	 	one	.
they	've	got	 the 	 ir 	 	own	flag	.	they	've	got	the	eye	 patch 	 es 	 	.
you	can	tell	when	you	're	running	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 one 	 	in	a	tribe	.
and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	it	's	 tribe 	 s 	 	--	not	money	,	not	 factor 	 ies 	 	--	that	can	change	our	world	,	that	can	change	 politic 	 s 	 	,	that	can	align	large	 number 	 s 	 	of	people	.
not	 be 	 cause 	 	you	force	them	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	against	 the 	 ir 	 	will	,
but	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	connect	.
that	what	we	do	for	a	living	now	,	all	of	us	,	i	think	,	is	find	 some 	 thing 	 	worth	changing	,	and	then	assemble	 tribe 	 s 	 	that	assemble	 tribe 	 s 	 	that	spread	the	idea	and	spread	the	idea	.
and	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	far	 big 	 ger 	 	than	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,
it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	 move 	 ment 	 	.
so	when	al	gore	set	out	to	change	the	world	 aga 	 in 	 	,	he	did	n't	do	it	by	 him 	 self 	 	.
and	he	did	n't	do	it	by	 buy 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	 ad 	 s 	 	.
he	did	it	by	creating	a	 move 	 ment 	 	.
 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	around	the	country	who	could	give	his	 present 	 ation 	 	for	him	,
 be 	 cause 	 	he	ca	n't	be	in	100	or	200	or	500	cities	in	each	night	.
you	do	n't	need	 every 	 one 	 	.
what	kevin	kelley	 ha 	 s 	 	taught	us	is	you	just	need	,	i	do	n't	know	,	a	thousand	true	 fan 	 s 	 	--
a	thousand	people	who	care	 en 	 ough 	 	that	they	will	get	you	the	next	round	and	the	next	round	and	the	next	round	.
and	that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	the	idea	you	create	,	the	product	you	create	,	the	 move 	 ment 	 	you	create	is	n't	for	 every 	 one 	 	,
it	's	not	a	mass	thing	.	that	's	not	what	 th 	 is 	 	is	about	.
what	it	's	about	 in 	 stead 	 	is	 find 	 ing 	 	the	true	 believ 	 ers 	 	.
it	's	easy	to	look	at	what	i	've	 s 	 aid 	 	so	far	,	and	say	,	``	wait	a	minute	,	i	do	n't	have	what	it	 take 	 s 	 	to	be	that	kind	of	 lead 	 er 	 	.	``
so	here	are	two	 lead 	 ers 	 	.	they	do	n't	have	a	lot	in	common	.
they	're	about	the	same	age	.	but	that	's	about	it	.
what	they	did	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	is	each	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	way	,	 create 	 d 	 	a	different	way	of	 navig 	 ating 	 	your	way	through	technology	.
so	some	people	will	go	out	and	get	people	to	be	on	one	team	.	and	some	people	will	get	people	to	be	on	the	other	team	.
it	 al 	 so 	 	 inform 	 s 	 	the	 decision 	 s 	 	you	make	when	you	make	 product 	 s 	 	or	 service 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	.
but	what	a	shame	that	it	's	not	 organize 	 d 	 	to	help	 author 	 s 	 	create	 move 	 ments 	 	.
what	would	happen	if	,	when	you	're	using	your	kindle	,	you	could	see	the	 comment 	 s 	 	and	 quote 	 s 	 	and	 note 	 s 	 	from	all	the	other	people	 read 	 ing 	 	the	same	book	 a 	 s 	 	you	in	that	moment	.
or	from	your	book	group	.	or	from	your	 friend 	 s 	 	,	or	from	the	circle	you	want	.
what	would	happen	if	 author 	 s 	 	,	or	people	with	 idea 	 s 	 	could	use	version	two	,	which	 come 	 s 	 	out	on	monday	,	and	use	it	to	organize	people	who	want	to	talk	about	 some 	 thing 	 	.
now	there	is	a	million	 thing 	 s 	 	i	could	share	with	you	about	the	 mechanic 	 s 	 	here	.
but	let	me	just	try	a	couple	.
the	beatles	did	not	invent	 teenager 	 s 	 	.
they	 mere 	 ly 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	to	lead	them	.
that	most	 move 	 ments 	 	,	most	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	that	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	is	about	 find 	 ing 	 	a	group	that	's	 dis 	 connect 	 ed 	 	but	 al 	 ready 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 year 	 ning 	 	--
not	 persuad 	 ing 	 	people	to	want	 some 	 thing 	 	they	do	n't	have	yet	.
when	diane	hatz	 work 	 ed 	 	on	``	the	meatrix	,	``	her	video	that	spread	all	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 inter 	 net 	 	about	the	way	farm	 animal 	 s 	 	are	 treat 	 ed 	 	,	she	did	n't	invent	the	idea	of	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 vega 	 n 	 	.
she	did	n't	invent	the	idea	of	 car 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	issue	.
but	she	 help 	 ed 	 	organize	people	,	and	 help 	 ed 	 	turn	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	 move 	 ment 	 	.
hugo	chavez	did	not	invent	the	 dis 	 affect 	 ed 	 	middle	and	lower	class	of	venezuela	.	he	 mere 	 ly 	 	led	them	.
bob	marley	did	not	invent	rastafarians	.
he	just	 steppe 	 d 	 	up	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	follow	me	.	``
derek	sivers	 invent 	 ed 	 	cd	baby	,	which	 allow 	 ed 	 	 in 	 dependent 	 	 music 	 ians 	 	to	have	a	place	to	sell	 the 	 ir 	 	music	 with 	 out 	 	selling	out	to	the	man	--
to	have	place	to	take	the	mission	they	 al 	 ready 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	go	to	,	and	connect	with	each	other	.
what	all	these	people	have	in	common	is	that	they	are	 here 	 tics 	 	.
that	 here 	 tics 	 	look	at	the	 stat 	 us 	 	quo	and	say	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	will	not	stand	.	i	ca	n't	 ab 	 ide 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 stat 	 us 	 	quo	.
i	am	 will 	 ing 	 	to	stand	up	and	be	 count 	 ed 	 	and	move	 thing 	 s 	 	forward	.
i	see	what	the	 stat 	 us 	 	quo	is	;	i	do	n't	like	it	.	``
that	 in 	 stead 	 	of	looking	at	all	the	little	 rule 	 s 	 	and	 follow 	 ing 	 	each	one	of	them	,	that	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	what	i	call	a	 sheep 	 walk 	 er 	 	--	 some 	 body 	 	who	's	half	 a 	 sleep 	 	,	 follow 	 ing 	 	 instruct 	 ions 	 	,	 keep 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	head	down	,	fitting	in	--	every	once	in	a	while	 some 	 one 	 	 stand 	 s 	 	up	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	not	me	.	``
 some 	 one 	 	 stand 	 s 	 	up	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	one	is	 import 	 ant 	 	.
we	need	to	organize	around	it	.	``
and	not	 every 	 one 	 	will	.	but	you	do	n't	need	 every 	 one 	 	.
you	just	need	a	few	people	--	--	who	will	look	at	the	 rule 	 s 	 	,	 real 	 ize 	 	they	make	no	sense	,	and	 real 	 ize 	 	how	much	they	want	to	be	 connect 	 ed 	 	.
so	tony	shea	 do 	 es 	 	not	run	a	shoe	store	.
zappos	is	n't	a	shoe	store	.
zappos	is	the	one	,	the	 on 	 ly 	 	,	the	best	-	there	-	ever	-	was	place	for	people	who	are	 in 	 to 	 	 shoe 	 s 	 	to	find	each	other	,	to	talk	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 pass 	 ion 	 	,	to	connect	with	people	who	care	more	about	 custom 	 er 	 	service	than	making	a	nickel	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	.
it	can	be	 some 	 thing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	prosaic	 a 	 s 	 	 shoe 	 s 	 	,	and	 some 	 thing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 over 	 throw 	 ing 	 	a	government	.
it	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	behavior	 th 	 ough 	 	.
what	it	 requir 	 es 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	geraldine	carter	 ha 	 s 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	,	is	to	be	able	to	say	,	``	i	ca	n't	do	 th 	 is 	 	by	 my 	 self 	 	.
but	if	i	can	get	other	people	to	join	my	climb	and	ride	,	then	together	we	can	get	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	all	want	.
we	're	just	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	 some 	 one 	 	to	lead	us	.	``
michelle	kaufman	 ha 	 s 	 	 pioneer 	 ed 	 	new	ways	of	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 environment 	 al 	 	 architect 	 ure 	 	.
she	 do 	 es 	 	n't	do	it	by	 quiet 	 ly 	 	building	one	house	at	a	time	.
she	 do 	 es 	 	it	by	 tell 	 ing 	 	a	story	to	people	who	want	to	hear	it	.
by	 connect 	 ing 	 	a	tribe	of	people	who	are	desperate	to	be	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	each	other	.
by	 lead 	 ing 	 	a	 move 	 ment 	 	and
making	change	.
and	around	and	around	and	around	it	 go 	 es 	 	.
so	three	 question 	 s 	 	i	'd	 off 	 er 	 	you	.
the	first	one	is	,	who	 exact 	 ly 	 	are	you	 up 	 setting 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	're	not	 up 	 setting 	 	 any 	 one 	 	,	you	're	not	changing	the	 stat 	 us 	 	quo	.
the	second	question	is	,	who	are	you	 connect 	 ing 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	for	a	lot	of	people	,	that	's	what	they	're	in	it	for	:
the	 connect 	 ions 	 	that	are	 be 	 ing 	 	made	,	one	to	the	other	.
and	the	third	one	is	,	who	are	you	 lead 	 ing 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	 focus 	 ing 	 	on	that	part	of	it	--	not	the	 mechanic 	 s 	 	of	what	you	're	building	,	but	the	who	,	and	the	 lead 	 ing 	 	part	--	is	where	change	 come 	 s 	 	.
so	blake	,	at	tom	's	 shoe 	 s 	 	,	had	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	idea	.
``	what	would	happen	if	every	time	 some 	 one 	 	 b 	 ought 	 	a	pair	of	these	 shoe 	 s 	 	i	 g 	 ave 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	pair	to	 some 	 one 	 	who	 do 	 es 	 	n't	even	own	a	pair	of	 shoe 	 s 	 	?	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	the	story	of	how	you	get	shelf	space	at	neiman	marcus	.
it	's	a	story	of	a	product	that	 tell 	 s 	 	a	story	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	walk	around	with	 th 	 is 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	pair	of	 shoe 	 s 	 	and	 some 	 one 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	what	are	 t 	 hose 	 	?	``
you	get	to	tell	the	story	on	blake	's	 be 	 half 	 	,	on	 be 	 half 	 	of	the	people	who	got	the	 shoe 	 s 	 	.
and	 sudden 	 ly 	 	it	's	not	one	pair	of	 shoe 	 s 	 	or	100	 pair 	 s 	 	of	 shoe 	 s 	 	.	it	's	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 pair 	 s 	 	of	 shoe 	 s 	 	.
my	friend	red	maxwell	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 pent 	 	the	last	10	 year 	 s 	 	 fight 	 ing 	 	against	juvenile	diabetes	.
not	 fight 	 ing 	 	the	 organ 	 ization 	 	that	's	 fight 	 ing 	 	it	--	 fight 	 ing 	 	with	them	,	 lead 	 ing 	 	them	,	 connect 	 ing 	 	them	,	 challeng 	 ing 	 	the	 stat 	 us 	 	quo	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	him	.
and	the	people	he	 surround 	 s 	 	 him 	 self 	 	with	need	the	 connect 	 ion 	 	.
they	need	the	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	.	it	 make 	 s 	 	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
you	do	n't	need	 per 	 mission 	 	from	people	to	lead	them	.
but	in	case	you	do	,	here	it	is	:
they	're	 wait 	 ing 	 	,	we	're	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	you	to	show	us	where	to	go	next	.
so	here	is	what	 lead 	 ers 	 	have	in	common	.	the	first	thing	is	,	they	 challeng 	 e 	 	the	 stat 	 us 	 	quo	.
they	 challeng 	 e 	 	what	's	 current 	 ly 	 	there	.
the	second	thing	is	,	they	build	a	culture	.
a	secret	language	,	a	seven	-	second	 hand 	 shake 	 	,
a	way	of	 know 	 ing 	 	that	you	're	in	or	out	.
they	have	curiosity	.	curiosity	about	people	in	the	tribe	,
curiosity	about	 out 	 sider 	 s 	 	.	they	're	 ask 	 ing 	 	 question 	 s 	 	.
they	connect	people	to	one	 an 	 other 	 	.
do	you	know	what	people	want	more	than	 any 	 thing 	 	?
they	want	to	be	 mis 	 s 	 ed 	 	.
they	want	to	be	 mis 	 s 	 ed 	 	the	day	they	do	n't	show	up	.
they	want	to	be	 mis 	 s 	 ed 	 	when	they	're	gone	.
and	tribe	 lead 	 ers 	 	can	do	that	.
it	's	 fasci 	 nating 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	all	tribe	 lead 	 ers 	 	have	charisma	,
but	you	do	n't	need	charisma	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	 lead 	 er 	 	.
 be 	 ing 	 	a	 lead 	 er 	 	 give 	 s 	 	you	charisma	.
if	you	look	and	 stud 	 y 	 	the	 lead 	 ers 	 	who	have	 succeed 	 ed 	 	,	that	's	where	charisma	 come 	 s 	 	from	--	from	the	 lead 	 ing 	 	.
 final 	 ly 	 	,	they	commit	.
they	commit	to	the	cause	.	they	commit	to	the	tribe	.
they	commit	to	the	people	who	are	there	.
so	i	'd	like	you	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	for	me	.
and	i	hope	you	'll	think	about	it	before	you	reject	it	out	-	of	-	hand	.
what	i	want	you	to	do	,	it	 on 	 ly 	 	 take 	 s 	 	24	 hour 	 s 	 	,	is	:	create	a	 move 	 ment 	 	.
 some 	 thing 	 	that	 matter 	 s 	 	.	start	.	do	it	.	we	need	it	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.	i	appreciate	it	.
