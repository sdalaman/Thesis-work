martin	luther	king	did	not	say	,	``	i	have	a	nightmare	,	``	when	he	inspired	the	civil	 right 	 s 	 	 move 	 ments 	 	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	have	a	dream	.	``
and	i	have	a	dream	.	i	have	a	dream	that	we	can	stop	 think 	 ing 	 	that	the	future	will	be	a	nightmare	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	be	a	 challeng 	 e 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	if	you	think	of	every	major	 block 	 bust 	 ing 	 	film	of	 re 	 cent 	 	 time 	 s 	 	,	 near 	 ly 	 	all	of	 it 	 s 	 	 vision 	 s 	 	for	 human 	 ity 	 	are	 apocalyp 	 tic 	 	.	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	film	is	one	of	the	 hard 	 est 	 	 watch 	 es 	 	of	modern	 time 	 s 	 	,	``	the	road	.	``
it	's	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	piece	of	 film 	 making 	 	,	but	 every 	 thing 	 	is	desolate	,	 every 	 thing 	 	is	dead	.
and	just	a	father	and	son	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	,	 walk 	 ing 	 	 a 	 long 	 	the	road	.
and	i	think	the	 environment 	 al 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	of	which	i	am	a	part	of	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 com 	 plicit 	 	in	creating	 th 	 is 	 	vision	of	the	future	.
for	too	long	,	we	have	 peddl 	 ed 	 	a	 night 	 mar 	 ish 	 	vision	of	what	's	going	to	happen	.
we	have	focused	on	the	worst	-	case	scenario	.
we	have	focused	on	the	 problem 	 s 	 	.
and	we	have	not	thought	 en 	 ough 	 	about	the	 solution 	 s 	 	.
we	've	used	fear	,	if	you	like	,	to	grab	people	's	attention	.
and	any	 psycho 	 logist 	 	will	tell	you	that	fear	in	the	organism	is	linked	to	flight	 mechan 	 ism 	 	.
it	's	part	of	the	fight	and	flight	 mechan 	 ism 	 	,	that	when	an	animal	is	 frighten 	 ed 	 	--	think	of	a	 de 	 er 	 	.
a	 de 	 er 	 	 freeze 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	still	,	 poise 	 d 	 	to	run	away	.
and	i	think	that	's	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	when	we	're	 ask 	 ing 	 	people	to	engage	with	our	agenda	around	 environment 	 al 	 	degradation	and	climate	change	.
people	are	freezing	and	running	away	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	using	fear	.
and	i	think	the	 environment 	 al 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	grow	up	and	start	to	think	about	what	progress	is	.
what	would	it	be	like	to	be	 improv 	 ing 	 	the	human	lot	?
and	one	of	the	 problem 	 s 	 	that	we	face	,	i	think	,	is	that	the	 on 	 ly 	 	people	that	have	 corner 	 ed 	 	the	market	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	progress	is	a	financial	definition	of	what	progress	is	,	an	economic	definition	of	what	progress	is	--	that	 some 	 how 	 	,	if	we	get	the	right	 number 	 s 	 	to	go	up	,	we	're	going	to	be	better	off	,	 whet 	 her 	 	that	's	on	the	stock	market	,	 whet 	 her 	 	that	's	with	gdp	and	economic	growth	,	that	 some 	 how 	 	life	is	going	to	get	better	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 how 	 	 appeal 	 ing 	 	to	human	greed	 in 	 stead 	 	of	fear	--	that	more	is	better	.
come	on	.	in	the	western	world	,	we	have	 en 	 ough 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	some	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	world	do	n't	,	but	we	have	 en 	 ough 	 	.
and	we	've	know	for	a	long	time	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	good	measure	of	the	 wel 	 fare 	 	of	 nation 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	the	architect	of	our	national	 account 	 ing 	 	system	,	simon	kuznets	,	in	the	1930s	,	 s 	 aid 	 	that	,	``	a	nation	's	 wel 	 fare 	 	can	 scarce 	 ly 	 	be	 infer 	 red 	 	from	 the 	 ir 	 	national	income	.	``
but	we	've	 create 	 d 	 	a	national	 account 	 ing 	 	system	which	is	 firm 	 ly 	 	based	on	production	and	producing	stuff	.
and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	 historic 	 al 	 	,	and	it	had	 it 	 s 	 	time	.
in	the	second	world	war	,	we	 need 	 ed 	 	to	produce	a	lot	of	stuff	.
and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	so	 success 	 ful 	 	at	producing	certain	 type 	 s 	 	of	stuff	that	we	 destroy 	 ed 	 	a	lot	of	europe	,	and	we	had	to	 re 	 build 	 	it	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	.
and	so	our	national	 account 	 ing 	 	system	 be 	 came 	 	 fix 	 ated 	 	on	what	we	can	produce	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	early	 a 	 s 	 	1968	,	 th 	 is 	 	 vision 	 ary 	 	man	,	robert	kennedy	,	at	the	start	of	his	ill	-	 fat 	 ed 	 	 p 	 resident 	 ial 	 	campaign	,	 g 	 ave 	 	the	most	eloquent	 de 	 construction 	 	of	gross	national	product	that	ever	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	.
and	he	 finish 	 ed 	 	his	talk	with	the	phrase	,	that	,	``	the	gross	national	product	 measure 	 s 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	 ex 	 cept 	 	that	which	 make 	 s 	 	life	 worth 	 while 	 	.	``
how	crazy	is	that	?	that	our	measure	of	progress	,	our	 domin 	 ant 	 	measure	of	progress	in	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	is	 measur 	 ing 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	 ex 	 cept 	 	that	which	 make 	 s 	 	life	 worth 	 while 	 	?
i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	if	kennedy	was	 al 	 ive 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	he	would	be	 ask 	 ing 	 	 statistic 	 ians 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 my 	 self 	 	to	go	out	and	find	out	what	 make 	 s 	 	life	 worth 	 while 	 	.
he	'd	be	 ask 	 ing 	 	us	to	 re 	 design 	 	our	national	 account 	 ing 	 	system	to	be	based	 up 	 on 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	social	justice	,	 sustain 	 ability 	 	and	people	's	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	social	 scientist 	 s 	 	have	 al 	 ready 	 	gone	out	and	 ask 	 ed 	 	these	 question 	 s 	 	around	the	world	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	from	a	global	survey	.
it	's	 ask 	 ing 	 	people	,	what	do	they	want	.
and	 un 	 surprising 	 ly 	 	,	people	all	around	the	world	say	that	what	they	want	is	happiness	,	for	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	children	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	they	think	money	is	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
it	's	there	,	but	it	's	not	 near 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 a 	 s 	 	happiness	,	and	it	's	not	 near 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 a 	 s 	 	love	.
we	all	need	to	love	and	be	 love 	 d 	 	in	life	.
it	's	not	 near 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 a 	 s 	 	health	.
we	want	to	be	 health 	 y 	 	and	live	a	full	life	.
these	seem	to	be	natural	human	 aspir 	 ations 	 	.
why	are	 statistic 	 ians 	 	not	 measur 	 ing 	 	these	?
why	are	we	not	 think 	 ing 	 	of	the	progress	of	 nation 	 s 	 	in	these	 term 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	just	how	much	stuff	we	have	?
and	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	with	my	adult	life	--	is	think	about	how	do	we	measure	happiness	,	how	do	we	measure	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	,	how	can	we	do	that	 with 	 in 	 	 environment 	 al 	 	 limit 	 s 	 	.
and	we	 create 	 d 	 	,	at	the	 organ 	 ization 	 	that	i	work	for	,	the	new	 economic 	 s 	 	 found 	 ation 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	we	call	the	happy	planet	index	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	think	people	should	be	happy	and	the	planet	should	be	happy	.
why	do	n't	we	create	a	measure	of	progress	that	 show 	 s 	 	that	?
and	what	we	do	,	is	we	say	that	the	ultimate	 out 	 come 	 	of	a	nation	is	how	 success 	 ful 	 	is	it	at	creating	happy	and	 health 	 y 	 	 live 	 s 	 	for	 it 	 s 	 	 citizen 	 s 	 	.
that	should	be	the	goal	of	every	nation	on	the	planet	.
but	we	have	to	remember	that	there	's	a	fundamental	 in 	 put 	 	to	that	,	and	that	is	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	planet	's	 resource 	 s 	 	we	use	.
we	all	have	one	planet	.	we	all	have	to	share	it	.
it	is	the	ultimate	scarce	resource	,	the	one	planet	that	we	share	.
and	 economic 	 s 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 scar 	 city 	 	.
when	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	scarce	resource	that	it	 want 	 s 	 	to	turn	 in 	 to 	 	a	 desir 	 able 	 	 out 	 come 	 	,	it	 think 	 s 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	efficiency	.	it	 think 	 s 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	how	much	bang	do	we	get	for	our	buck	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	measure	of	how	much	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	we	get	for	our	planetary	resource	use	.
it	is	an	efficiency	measure	.
and	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	 eas 	 iest 	 	way	to	show	you	that	,	is	to	show	you	 th 	 is 	 	graph	.
running	 horizon 	 t 	 ally 	 	 a 	 long 	 	the	graph	,	is	``	 eco 	 logical 	 	 foot 	 print 	 	,	``	which	is	a	measure	of	how	much	 resource 	 s 	 	we	use	and	how	much	pressure	we	put	on	the	planet	.
more	is	bad	.
running	 vert 	 ically 	 	 up 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	is	a	measure	 call 	 ed 	 	``	happy	life	 year 	 s 	 	.	``	it	's	about	the	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	of	 nation 	 s 	 	.
it	's	like	a	happiness	 adjust 	 ed 	 	life	-	 expect 	 ancy 	 	.
it	's	like	quality	and	 quant 	 ity 	 	of	life	in	 nation 	 s 	 	.
and	the	yellow	dot	there	you	see	,	is	the	global	average	.
now	,	there	's	a	huge	array	of	 nation 	 s 	 	around	that	global	average	.
to	the	top	right	of	the	graph	,	are	 count 	 ries 	 	which	are	 do 	 ing 	 	 reason 	 ably 	 	well	and	producing	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	,	but	they	're	using	a	lot	of	planet	to	get	there	.
they	are	the	u.s.a.	,	other	western	 count 	 ries 	 	going	 a 	 cross 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 triangle 	 s 	 	and	a	few	 gu 	 lf 	 	 state 	 s 	 	in	there	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
 con 	 verse 	 ly 	 	,	at	the	bottom	left	of	the	graph	,	are	 count 	 ries 	 	that	are	not	producing	much	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	--	 typical 	 ly 	 	,	sub	-	saharan	africa	.
in	hobbesian	 term 	 s 	 	,	life	is	short	and	 b 	 rut 	 ish 	 	there	.
the	average	life	 expect 	 ancy 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	of	these	 count 	 ries 	 	is	 on 	 ly 	 	40	 year 	 s 	 	.
malaria	,	hiv	/	 aid 	 s 	 	are	 kill 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	people	in	these	 region 	 s 	 	of	the	world	.
but	now	for	the	good	news	!
there	are	some	 count 	 ries 	 	up	there	,	yellow	 triangle 	 s 	 	,	that	are	 do 	 ing 	 	better	than	global	average	,	that	are	 head 	 ing 	 	up	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	top	left	of	the	graph	.

we	want	to	be	top	left	,	where	good	 live 	 s 	 	do	n't	cost	the	earth	.
they	're	latin	american	.
the	country	on	 it 	 s 	 	own	up	at	the	top	is	a	place	i	have	n't	 be 	 en 	 	to	.

costa	rica	.
costa	rica	--	average	life	 expect 	 ancy 	 	is	78	-	and	-	a	-	half	 year 	 s 	 	.
that	is	 long 	 er 	 	than	in	the	usa	.
they	are	,	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	the	 lat 	 est 	 	gallup	world	poll	,	the	 hap 	 pies 	 t 	 	nation	on	the	planet	--	than	 any 	 body 	 	;	more	than	switzerland	and	denmark	.
they	are	the	 hap 	 pies 	 t 	 	place	.
they	are	 do 	 ing 	 	that	on	a	quarter	of	the	 resource 	 s 	 	that	are	used	 typical 	 ly 	 	in	[	the	]	western	world	--	a	quarter	of	the	 resource 	 s 	 	.
what	's	going	on	there	?
what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	costa	rica	?
we	can	look	at	some	of	the	data	.
99	percent	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 electric 	 ity 	 	 come 	 s 	 	from	 renew 	 able 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	.
 the 	 ir 	 	government	is	one	of	the	first	to	commit	to	be	carbon	neutral	by	2021	.
they	 abolish 	 ed 	 	the	 arm 	 y 	 	in	1949	--	1949	.
and	they	 invest 	 ed 	 	in	social	 program 	 s 	 	--	health	and	education	.
they	have	one	of	the	highest	 liter 	 acy 	 	rates	in	latin	america	and	in	the	world	.
and	they	have	that	latin	 vib 	 e 	 	,	do	n't	they	.
they	have	the	social	 connect 	 ed 	 ness 	 	.
the	 challeng 	 e 	 	is	,	that	possibly	--	and	the	thing	we	might	have	to	think	about	--	is	that	the	future	might	not	be	north	american	,	might	not	be	western	european	.
it	might	be	latin	american	.
and	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	is	to	pull	the	global	average	up	here	.
that	's	what	we	need	to	do	.
and	if	we	're	going	to	do	that	,	we	need	to	pull	 count 	 ries 	 	from	the	bottom	,	and	we	need	to	pull	 count 	 ries 	 	from	the	right	of	the	graph	.
and	then	we	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	create	a	happy	planet	.
that	's	one	way	of	looking	at	it	.
 an 	 other 	 	way	of	looking	at	it	is	looking	at	time	 trend 	 s 	 	.
we	do	n't	have	good	data	going	back	for	every	country	in	the	world	,	but	for	some	of	the	 rich 	 est 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	the	oecd	group	,	we	do	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	trend	in	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	over	that	time	,	a	small	 in 	 crease 	 	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	trend	in	 eco 	 logical 	 	 foot 	 print 	 	.
and	so	in	strict	happy	-	planet	 method 	 ology 	 	,	we	've	 be 	 come 	 	less	efficient	at	 turn 	 ing 	 	our	ultimate	scarce	resource	 in 	 to 	 	the	 out 	 come 	 	we	want	to	.
and	the	point	 re 	 ally 	 	is	,	is	that	i	think	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	 every 	 body 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	would	like	 socie 	 ty 	 	to	get	to	2050	 with 	 out 	 	an	 apocalyp 	 tic 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	not	 ver 	 y 	 	long	away	.
it	's	half	a	human	 life 	 time 	 	away	.
a	child	 enter 	 ing 	 	school	 to 	 day 	 	will	be	my	age	in	2050	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 di 	 stant 	 	future	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	the	u.k.	government	target	on	carbon	and	 green 	 house 	 	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
and	i	put	it	to	you	,	that	is	not	business	 a 	 s 	 	usual	.
that	is	changing	our	business	.
that	is	changing	the	way	we	create	our	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	,	we	do	our	government	policy	and	we	live	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
and	the	point	is	,	we	need	to	carry	on	increasing	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	.
no	one	can	go	to	the	 poll 	 s 	 	and	say	that	quality	of	life	is	going	to	 reduc 	 e 	 	.
 non 	 e 	 	of	us	,	i	think	,	want	human	progress	to	stop	.
i	think	we	want	it	to	carry	on	.
i	think	we	want	the	lot	of	 human 	 ity 	 	to	keep	on	increasing	.
and	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	climate	change	 skeptic 	 s 	 	and	 deni 	 ers 	 	come	in	.
i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	they	want	.	they	want	quality	of	life	to	keep	increasing	.
they	want	to	hold	on	to	what	they	've	got	.
and	if	we	're	going	to	engage	them	,	i	think	that	's	what	we	've	got	to	do	.
and	that	 mean 	 s 	 	we	have	to	 re 	 ally 	 	 in 	 crease 	 	efficiency	even	more	.
now	that	's	all	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	to	draw	 graph 	 s 	 	and	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	,	but	the	point	is	we	need	to	turn	 t 	 hose 	 	 curv 	 es 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	i	think	we	can	take	a	leaf	out	of	 system 	 s 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	,	 system 	 s 	 	 engineer 	 s 	 	,	where	they	create	 feed 	 back 	 	 loop 	 s 	 	,	put	the	right	information	at	the	right	point	of	time	.
human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 motiv 	 ated 	 	by	the	``	now	.	``
you	put	a	smart	meter	in	your	home	,	and	you	see	how	much	 electric 	 ity 	 	you	're	using	right	now	,	how	much	it	's	 cost 	 ing 	 	you	,	your	 kid 	 s 	 	go	around	and	turn	the	 light 	 s 	 	off	 pre 	 tty 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
what	would	that	look	like	for	 socie 	 ty 	 	?
why	is	it	,	on	the	radio	news	every	 even 	 ing 	 	,	i	hear	the	ftse	100	,	the	dow	jones	,	the	dollar	pound	ratio	--	i	do	n't	even	know	which	way	the	dollar	pound	ratio	should	go	to	be	good	news	.

but	a	piece	of	work	we	did	was	on	:	what	five	positive	 action 	 s 	 	can	you	do	to	improve	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	in	your	life	?
and	the	point	of	these	is	they	are	,	not	 quit 	 e 	 	,	the	 secret 	 s 	 	of	happiness	,	but	they	are	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	think	happiness	will	flow	out	the	side	from	.
and	the	first	of	these	is	to	connect	,	is	that	your	social	 relationship 	 s 	 	are	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 corner 	 stone 	 s 	 	of	your	life	.
do	you	invest	the	time	with	your	 love 	 d 	 	 one 	 s 	 	that	you	could	do	,	and	energy	?
keep	building	them	.
the	second	one	is	be	active	.
the	 fast 	 est 	 	way	out	of	a	bad	mood	:	step	 out 	 side 	 	,	go	for	a	walk	,	turn	the	radio	on	and	dance	.
 be 	 ing 	 	active	is	great	for	our	positive	mood	.
the	third	one	is	take	notice	.
how	aware	are	you	of	 thing 	 s 	 	going	on	around	the	world	,	the	 season 	 s 	 	changing	,	people	around	you	?
do	you	notice	what	's	 bubb 	 ling 	 	up	for	you	and	 try 	 ing 	 	to	emerge	?
based	on	a	lot	of	evidence	for	 mind 	 fulness 	 	,	cognitive	 behavior 	 al 	 	therapy	,	[	 ver 	 y 	 	]	strong	for	our	well	 be 	 ing 	 	.
the	fourth	is	keep	 learn 	 ing 	 	and	keep	is	 import 	 ant 	 	--	 learn 	 ing 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	whole	life	course	.
 old 	 er 	 	people	who	keep	 learn 	 ing 	 	and	are	 cur 	 ious 	 	,	they	have	much	better	health	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	than	 t 	 hose 	 	who	start	to	close	down	.
but	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	to	be	 form 	 al 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	;	it	's	not	knowledge	based	.
it	's	more	curiosity	.
it	can	be	 learn 	 ing 	 	to	cook	a	new	dish	,	 pick 	 ing 	 	up	an	instrument	you	 for 	 got 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	child	.
keep	 learn 	 ing 	 	.
and	the	final	one	is	that	most	anti	-	economic	of	 activ 	 ities 	 	,	but	give	.
our	 gene 	 ros 	 ity 	 	,	our	 al 	 truism 	 	,	our	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	are	all	 hard 	 wired 	 	to	the	reward	 mechan 	 ism 	 	in	our	brain	.
we	feel	good	if	we	give	.
you	can	do	an	experiment	where	you	give	two	 group 	 s 	 	of	people	a	hundred	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
you	tell	one	of	them	to	 s 	 pend 	 	it	on	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	one	on	other	people	.
you	measure	 the 	 ir 	 	happiness	at	the	end	of	the	day	,	 t 	 hose 	 	that	have	gone	and	 s 	 pent 	 	on	other	people	are	much	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	that	 t 	 hose 	 	that	 s 	 pent 	 	it	on	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
and	these	five	ways	,	which	we	put	onto	these	 hand 	 y 	 	 post 	 card 	 s 	 	,	i	would	say	,	do	n't	have	to	cost	the	earth	.
they	do	n't	have	any	carbon	content	.
they	do	n't	need	a	lot	of	material	 good 	 s 	 	to	be	satisfied	.
and	so	i	think	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 feas 	 ible 	 	that	happiness	 do 	 es 	 	not	cost	the	earth	.
now	,	martin	luther	king	,	on	the	eve	of	his	death	,	 g 	 ave 	 	an	 in 	 credible 	 	speech	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	know	there	are	 challeng 	 es 	 	 a 	 head 	 	,	there	may	be	trouble	 a 	 head 	 	,	but	i	fear	no	one	.	i	do	n't	care	.
i	have	 be 	 en 	 	to	the	mountain	top	,	and	i	have	 s 	 een 	 	the	 promise 	 d 	 	land	.	``
now	,	he	was	a	 preach 	 er 	 	,	but	i	 believ 	 e 	 	the	 environment 	 al 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	and	,	in	fact	,	the	business	community	,	government	,	 need 	 s 	 	to	go	to	the	top	of	the	mountain	top	,	and	it	 need 	 s 	 	to	look	out	,	and	it	 need 	 s 	 	to	see	the	 promise 	 d 	 	land	,	or	the	land	of	promise	,	and	it	 need 	 s 	 	to	have	a	vision	of	a	world	that	we	all	want	.
and	not	 on 	 ly 	 	that	,	we	need	to	create	a	great	 transit 	 ion 	 	to	get	there	,	and	we	need	to	pave	that	great	 transit 	 ion 	 	with	good	 thing 	 s 	 	.
human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	want	to	be	happy	.
pave	them	with	the	five	ways	.
and	we	need	to	have	 sign 	 post 	 s 	 	 gather 	 ing 	 	people	together	and	 point 	 ing 	 	them	--	 some 	 thing 	 	like	the	happy	planet	index	.	and	then	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	we	can	all	create	a	world	we	all	want	,	where	happiness	 do 	 es 	 	not	cost	the	earth	.
