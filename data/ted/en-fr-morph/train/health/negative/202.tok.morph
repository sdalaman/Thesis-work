welcome	to	``	five	 danger 	 ous 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	you	should	let	your	children	do	.	``	i	do	n't	have	children	.
i	borrow	my	 friend 	 s 	 	'	children	,	so	take	all	 th 	 is 	 	 ad 	 vice 	 	with	a	grain	of	salt	.
i	'm	gever	tulley	.
i	'm	a	contract	computer	scientist	by	trade	,	but	i	'm	the	founder	of	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 tinker 	 ing 	 	school	.
it	's	a	summer	program	which	 aim 	 s 	 	to	help	 kid 	 s 	 	to	learn	how	to	build	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	they	think	of	.
so	we	build	a	lot	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	i	do	put	power	 tool 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 hand 	 s 	 	of	second	-	graders	.
so	if	you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	your	kid	to	 tinker 	 ing 	 	school	,	they	do	come	back	 bruis 	 ed 	 	,	 scrap 	 ed 	 	and	 blood 	 y 	 	.
so	,	you	know	,	we	live	in	a	world	that	's	 subject 	 ed 	 	to	ever	more	 string 	 ent 	 	child	 safe 	 ty 	 	 regulat 	 ions 	 	.
there	 do 	 es 	 	n't	seem	to	be	any	limit	on	how	crazy	child	 safe 	 ty 	 	 regulat 	 ions 	 	can	get	.
we	put	 suffoc 	 ation 	 	 war 	 ning 	 s 	 	on	all	the	--	on	every	piece	of	plastic	film	 manufactur 	 ed 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	or	for	sale	with	an	item	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
we	put	 war 	 ning 	 s 	 	on	coffee	 cup 	 s 	 	to	tell	us	that	the	 content 	 s 	 	may	be	hot	.
and	we	seem	to	think	that	any	item	 sharp 	 er 	 	than	a	golf	ball	is	too	sharp	for	children	under	the	age	of	10	.
so	where	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	trend	stop	?
when	we	round	every	corner	and	eliminate	every	sharp	object	,	every	 poke 	 y 	 	bit	in	the	world	,	then	the	first	time	that	 kid 	 s 	 	come	in	contact	with	 any 	 thing 	 	sharp	or	not	made	out	of	round	plastic	,	they	'll	hurt	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	with	it	.
so	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	 bound 	 aries 	 	of	what	we	determine	 a 	 s 	 	the	 safe 	 ty 	 	zone	grow	ever	 small 	 er 	 	,	we	cut	off	our	children	from	 valu 	 able 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	to	learn	how	to	interact	with	the	world	around	them	.
and	 de 	 spite 	 	all	of	our	best	 effort 	 s 	 	and	 intent 	 ions 	 	,	 kid 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 ways 	 	going	to	figure	out	how	to	do	the	most	 danger 	 ous 	 	thing	they	can	,	in	 what 	 ever 	 	environment	they	can	.
so	 de 	 spite 	 	the	 pro 	 voc 	 ative 	 	title	,	 th 	 is 	 	 present 	 ation 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	about	 safe 	 ty 	 	and	about	some	simple	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	can	do	to	raise	our	 kid 	 s 	 	to	be	creative	,	confident	and	in	control	of	the	environment	around	them	.
and	what	i	now	present	to	you	is	an	excerpt	from	a	book	in	progress	.
the	book	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	50	 danger 	 ous 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	five	 danger 	 ous 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
thing	number	one	--	play	with	fire	.	 learn 	 ing 	 	to	control	one	of	the	most	 element 	 al 	 	 force 	 s 	 	in	nature	is	a	 pivot 	 al 	 	moment	in	any	child	's	personal	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
 whet 	 her 	 	we	remember	it	or	not	,	it	's	a	--	it	's	the	first	time	we	 re 	 ally 	 	get	control	of	one	of	these	 myster 	 ious 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
these	 myster 	 ies 	 	are	 on 	 ly 	 	 reveal 	 ed 	 	to	 t 	 hose 	 	who	get	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	play	with	it	.
so	,	 play 	 ing 	 	with	fire	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	like	one	of	the	great	 thing 	 s 	 	we	ever	 discover 	 ed 	 	,	fire	.
from	 play 	 ing 	 	with	it	,	they	learn	some	 bas 	 ic 	 	 principle 	 s 	 	about	fire	,	about	 in 	 take 	 	,	about	 com 	 bust 	 ion 	 	,	about	exhaust	.
these	are	the	three	 work 	 ing 	 	 element 	 s 	 	of	fire	that	you	have	to	have	to	have	a	good	controlled	fire	.
and	you	can	think	of	the	open	-	pit	fire	 a 	 s 	 	a	 labor 	 atory 	 	.
you	do	n't	know	what	they	're	going	to	learn	from	 play 	 ing 	 	with	it	.
you	know	,	let	them	fool	around	with	it	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 term 	 s 	 	and	trust	me	,	they	're	going	to	learn	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	ca	n't	get	out	of	 play 	 ing 	 	with	dora	the	 explore 	 r 	 	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	.
number	two	--	own	a	 pocket 	 knife 	 	.	pocketknives	are	kind	of	 drift 	 ing 	 	out	of	our	cultural	 conscious 	 ness 	 	,	which	i	think	is	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	thing	.
your	first	--	your	first	 pocket 	 knife 	 	is	like	the	first	universal	tool	that	you	're	 give 	 n 	 	.
you	know	,	it	's	a	 s 	 pat 	 ula 	 	,	it	's	a	pry	bar	,	it	's	a	 screw 	 driver 	 	and	it	's	a	blade	.
and	it	's	a	--	it	's	a	 power 	 ful 	 	and	 empower 	 ing 	 	tool	.
and	in	a	lot	of	 culture 	 s 	 	they	give	knives	--	like	,	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	they	're	 toddler 	 s 	 	they	have	knives	.
these	are	inuit	children	cutting	whale	 blu 	 b 	 ber 	 	.
i	first	saw	 th 	 is 	 	in	a	canadian	film	board	film	when	i	was	10	,	and	it	left	a	 last 	 ing 	 	impression	,	to	see	 bab 	 ies 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	with	knives	.
and	it	 show 	 s 	 	that	 kid 	 s 	 	can	develop	an	 extend 	 ed 	 	sense	of	self	through	a	tool	at	a	 ver 	 y 	 	young	age	.
you	lay	down	a	couple	of	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 rule 	 s 	 	--	 al 	 ways 	 	cut	away	from	your	body	,	keep	the	blade	sharp	,	never	force	it	--	and	these	are	 thing 	 s 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	can	understand	and	practice	with	.
and	 yea 	 h 	 	,	they	're	going	to	cut	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
i	have	some	 terr 	 ible 	 	 scar 	 s 	 	on	my	 leg 	 s 	 	from	where	i	 stab 	 bed 	 	 my 	 self 	 	.	but	you	know	,	they	're	young	.	they	heal	fast	.
number	three	--	throw	a	spear	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	our	 brain 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	wired	for	 throw 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	and	,	like	 muscle 	 s 	 	,	if	you	do	n't	use	 part 	 s 	 	of	your	brain	,	they	tend	to	 a 	 trophy 	 	over	time	.
but	when	you	 exercis 	 e 	 	them	,	any	 give 	 n 	 	muscle	 add 	 s 	 	strength	to	the	whole	system	and	that	 appli 	 es 	 	to	your	brain	too	.
so	 p 	 rac 	 tic 	 ing 	 	 throw 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 show 	 n 	 	to	 stimul 	 ate 	 	the	frontal	and	 par 	 ietal 	 	 lobe 	 s 	 	,	which	have	to	do	with	visual	 acu 	 ity 	 	,	3d	 understand 	 ing 	 	,	and	structural	problem	solving	,	so	it	 give 	 s 	 	a	sense	--
it	 help 	 s 	 	develop	 the 	 ir 	 	 visual 	 ization 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 predict 	 ive 	 	ability	.
and	 throw 	 ing 	 	is	a	combination	of	 analytic 	 al 	 	and	physical	skill	,	so	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	good	for	that	kind	of	whole	-	body	training	.
these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	target	-	based	practice	 al 	 so 	 	 help 	 s 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	develop	attention	and	 concent 	 ration 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	.
so	 t 	 hose 	 	are	great	.
number	four	--	 de 	 construct 	 	 appli 	 ance 	 s 	 	.
there	is	a	world	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	your	 dish 	 wash 	 er 	 	.
next	time	you	're	about	to	throw	out	an	 appli 	 ance 	 	,	do	n't	throw	it	out	.
take	it	 a 	 part 	 	with	your	kid	,	or	 s 	 end 	 	him	to	my	school	and	we	'll	take	it	 a 	 part 	 	with	them	.
even	if	you	do	n't	know	what	the	 part 	 s 	 	are	,	 puzzl 	 ing 	 	out	what	they	might	be	for	is	a	 re 	 ally 	 	good	practice	for	the	 kid 	 s 	 	to	get	sort	of	the	sense	that	they	can	take	 thing 	 s 	 	 a 	 part 	 	,	and	no	matter	how	complex	they	are	,	they	can	understand	 part 	 s 	 	of	them	and	that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	they	can	understand	all	of	them	.
it	's	a	sense	of	 know 	 ability 	 	,	that	 some 	 thing 	 	is	 know 	 able 	 	.
so	these	black	boxes	that	we	live	with	and	take	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	complex	 thing 	 s 	 	made	by	other	people	and	you	can	understand	them	.
number	five	--	two	-	parter	.
break	the	digital	 mill 	 e 	 nnium 	 	 copy 	 right 	 	act	.
there	are	 law 	 s 	 	beyond	 safe 	 ty 	 	 regulat 	 ions 	 	that	attempt	to	limit	how	we	can	interact	with	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	own	--	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	digital	media	.
it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 exercis 	 e 	 	--	buy	a	song	on	itunes	,	write	it	to	a	cd	,	then	rip	the	cd	to	an	mp	3	and	play	it	on	your	 ver 	 y 	 	same	computer	.
you	've	just	broken	a	law	.
 technical 	 ly 	 	the	riaa	can	come	and	persecute	you	.
it	's	an	 import 	 ant 	 	 less 	 on 	 	for	 kid 	 s 	 	to	understand	--	that	some	of	these	 law 	 s 	 	get	broken	by	accident	and	that	 law 	 s 	 	have	to	be	 interpret 	 ed 	 	.
and	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	we	often	talk	about	with	the	 kid 	 s 	 	when	we	're	 fool 	 ing 	 	around	with	 thing 	 s 	 	and	 break 	 ing 	 	them	open	and	taking	them	 a 	 part 	 	and	using	them	for	other	 thing 	 s 	 	--	and	 al 	 so 	 	when	we	go	out	and	drive	a	car	.
 driv 	 ing 	 	a	car	is	a	--	is	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 empower 	 ing 	 	act	for	a	young	child	,
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	ultimate	.	for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	are	n't	 comfort 	 able 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 break 	 ing 	 	the	law	,	you	can	drive	a	car	with	your	child	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	great	stage	for	a	kid	.
 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	about	the	same	time	that	they	get	 latch 	 ed 	 	onto	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	,	these	big	 thing 	 s 	 	in	the	 out 	 side 	 	world	that	they	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	a	grip	on	.
a	car	is	a	similar	object	,	and	they	can	get	in	a	car	and	drive	it	.
and	that	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	,	like	--	it	 give 	 s 	 	them	a	handle	on	a	world	in	a	way	that	they	would	n't	--	that	they	do	n't	often	have	access	to	.
so	--	and	it	's	 perfect 	 ly 	 	legal	.
find	a	big	empty	lot	,	make	 s 	 ure 	 	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	in	it	and	it	's	on	private	 proper 	 ty 	 	,	and	let	them	drive	your	car	.	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	safe	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
and	it	's	 f 	 un 	 	for	the	whole	family	.
so	,	let	's	see	.
i	think	that	's	it	.	that	's	number	five	and	a	half	.	ok	.
