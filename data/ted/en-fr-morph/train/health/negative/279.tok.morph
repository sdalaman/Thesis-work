my	work	is	about	the	 behavior 	 s 	 	that	we	all	engage	in	 un 	 conscious 	 ly 	 	,	on	a	 collect 	 ive 	 	level	.
and	what	i	mean	by	that	,	it	's	the	 behavior 	 s 	 	that	we	're	in	 deni 	 al 	 	about	,	and	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	 oper 	 ate 	 	 be 	 low 	 	the	surface	of	our	 dai 	 ly 	 	 aware 	 ness 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	,	we	all	do	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	all	the	time	,	 every 	 day 	 	.	it	's	like	when	you	're	mean	to	your	wife	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	mad	at	 some 	 body 	 	else	.
or	when	you	drink	a	little	too	much	at	a	party	,	just	out	of	 anxie 	 ty 	 	.
or	when	you	 over 	 eat 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	your	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	are	hurt	,	or	 what 	 ever 	 	.
and	when	we	do	these	kind	of	 thing 	 s 	 	,	when	300	million	people	do	 un 	 conscious 	 	 behavior 	 s 	 	,	then	it	can	add	up	to	a	 catastroph 	 ic 	 	 con 	 sequence 	 	that	 no 	 body 	 	 want 	 s 	 	,	and	no	one	 intend 	 ed 	 	.
and	that	's	what	i	look	at	with	my	 photograph 	 ic 	 	work	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	image	i	just	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 complete 	 d 	 	,	that	is	--	when	you	stand	back	at	a	distance	,	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	some	kind	of	neo	-	 got 	 hic 	 	,	cartoon	image	of	a	 factor 	 y 	 	 spew 	 ing 	 	out	 poll 	 ution 	 	.	and	 a 	 s 	 	you	get	a	little	bit	 close 	 r 	 	,	it	 start 	 s 	 	looking	like	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 pipe 	 s 	 	,	like	 may 	 be 	 	a	chemical	plant	,	or	a	 refine 	 ry 	 	,	or	 may 	 be 	 	a	 hell 	 ish 	 	 free 	 way 	 	 inter 	 change 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	get	all	the	way	up	close	,	you	 real 	 ize 	 	that	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	made	of	 lot 	 s 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	plastic	 cup 	 s 	 	.
and	in	fact	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	million	plastic	 cup 	 s 	 	,	which	is	the	number	of	plastic	 cup 	 s 	 	that	are	used	on	 air 	 line 	 	 flight 	 s 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	every	six	 hour 	 s 	 	.
we	use	four	million	 cup 	 s 	 	a	day	on	 air 	 line 	 	 flight 	 s 	 	,	and	 virtual 	 ly 	 	 non 	 e 	 	of	them	are	 re 	 used 	 	or	 recycl 	 ed 	 	.	they	just	do	n't	do	that	in	that	industry	.
now	,	that	number	is	 dwarf 	 ed 	 	by	the	number	of	paper	 cup 	 s 	 	we	use	every	day	,	and	that	is	40	million	 cup 	 s 	 	a	day	for	hot	 beverage 	 s 	 	,	most	of	which	is	coffee	.
i	could	n't	fit	40	million	 cup 	 s 	 	on	a	canvas	,	but	i	was	able	to	put	410,000	.	that	's	what	410,000	 cup 	 s 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
that	's	15	 minute 	 s 	 	of	our	cup	consumption	.
and	if	you	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	stack	up	that	 man 	 y 	 	 cup 	 s 	 	in	real	life	,	that	's	the	 s 	 ize 	 	it	would	be	.
and	there	's	an	hour	's	worth	of	our	 cup 	 s 	 	.	and	there	's	a	day	's	worth	of	our	 cup 	 s 	 	.
you	can	still	see	the	little	people	way	down	there	.
that	's	 a 	 s 	 	high	 a 	 s 	 	a	42	-	story	building	,	and	i	put	the	statue	of	 liber 	 ty 	 	in	there	 a 	 s 	 	a	scale	 re 	 ference 	 	.
 s 	 peaking 	 	of	justice	,	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	 phenomen 	 on 	 	going	on	in	our	culture	that	i	find	 deep 	 ly 	 	 trou 	 bling 	 	,	and	that	is	that	america	,	right	now	,	 ha 	 s 	 	the	largest	 percent 	 age 	 	of	 it 	 s 	 	population	in	 pri 	 son 	 	of	any	country	on	earth	.
one	out	of	four	people	,	one	out	of	four	 human 	 s 	 	in	 pri 	 son 	 	are	americans	,	 imprison 	 ed 	 	in	our	country	.
and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	show	the	number	.
the	number	is	2.3	million	americans	 we 	 re 	 	 incarce 	 rated 	 	in	2005	.
and	that	's	gone	up	since	then	,	but	we	do	n't	have	the	 number 	 s 	 	yet	.
so	,	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	show	2.3	million	 pri 	 son 	 	 uniform 	 s 	 	,	and	in	the	actual	print	of	 th 	 is 	 	piece	,	each	uniform	is	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	nickel	on	 it 	 s 	 	edge	.
they	're	 tin 	 y 	 	.	they	're	 bare 	 ly 	 	visible	 a 	 s 	 	a	piece	of	material	,	and	to	show	2.3	million	of	them	 requir 	 ed 	 	a	canvas	that	was	 large 	 r 	 	than	any	 print 	 er 	 	in	the	world	would	print	.
and	so	i	had	to	divide	it	up	 in 	 to 	 	 multi 	 ple 	 	 pan 	 el 	 s 	 	that	are	10	feet	tall	by	25	feet	wide	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	that	piece	 install 	 ed 	 	in	a	 gall 	 ery 	 	in	new	york	--
 t 	 hose 	 	are	my	 parent 	 s 	 	looking	at	the	piece	.
every	time	i	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	piece	,	i	 al 	 ways 	 	wonder	if	my	mom	's	 whisper 	 ing 	 	to	my	dad	,	``	he	 final 	 ly 	 	 fold 	 ed 	 	his	 laundr 	 y 	 	.	``
i	want	to	show	you	some	 piece 	 s 	 	now	that	are	about	 addict 	 ion 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	one	is	about	 cigar 	 ette 	 	 addict 	 ion 	 	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	make	a	piece	that	 show 	 s 	 	the	actual	number	of	americans	who	die	from	 cigar 	 ette 	 	 smok 	 ing 	 	.
more	than	400,000	people	die	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	every	year	from	 smok 	 ing 	 	 cigar 	 ette 	 s 	 	.
and	so	,	 th 	 is 	 	piece	is	made	up	of	 lot 	 s 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	boxes	of	 cigar 	 ette 	 s 	 	.
and	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	step	back	,	you	see	that	it	's	a	 paint 	 ing 	 	by	van	gogh	,	 call 	 ed 	 	``	skull	with	 cigar 	 ette 	 	.	``
it	's	a	strange	thing	to	think	about	,	that	on	9/11	,	when	that	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	3,000	americans	 di 	 ed 	 	.	and	do	you	remember	the	 respons 	 e 	 	?
it	 reverbe 	 rated 	 	around	the	world	,	and	will	 continu 	 e 	 	to	 reverbe 	 rate 	 	through	time	.
it	will	be	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	talk	about	in	100	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	yet	on	that	same	day	,	1,100	americans	 di 	 ed 	 	from	 smok 	 ing 	 	.
and	the	day	after	that	,	 an 	 other 	 	1,100	americans	 di 	 ed 	 	from	 smok 	 ing 	 	.
and	every	single	day	since	then	,	1,100	americans	have	 di 	 ed 	 	.
and	 to 	 day 	 	,	1,100	americans	are	 dy 	 ing 	 	from	 cigar 	 ette 	 	 smok 	 ing 	 	.
and	we	are	n't	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	it	--	we	dismiss	it	.
the	tobacco	lobby	,	it	's	too	strong	.
we	just	dismiss	it	out	of	our	 conscious 	 ness 	 	.
and	 know 	 ing 	 	what	we	know	about	the	 destruct 	 ive 	 	power	of	 cigar 	 ette 	 s 	 	,	we	 continu 	 e 	 	to	allow	our	children	,	our	 son 	 s 	 	and	 daughter 	 s 	 	,	to	be	in	the	presence	of	the	 influence 	 s 	 	that	start	them	 smok 	 ing 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	the	next	piece	is	about	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	just	 lot 	 s 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 cigar 	 ette 	 s 	 	:	65,000	 cigar 	 ette 	 s 	 	,	which	is	equal	to	the	number	of	 teenager 	 s 	 	who	will	start	 smok 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	month	,	and	every	month	in	the	u.s	.
more	than	700,000	children	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	aged	18	and	under	begin	 smok 	 ing 	 	every	year	.
one	more	strange	 epi 	 demic 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	that	i	want	to	acquaint	you	with	is	 th 	 is 	 	 phenomen 	 on 	 	of	abuse	and	 mis 	 use 	 	of	prescription	 drug 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	image	i	've	made	out	of	 lot 	 s 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	vicodin	.	well	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	 on 	 ly 	 	had	one	vicodin	that	i	 s 	 can 	 ned 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 time 	 s 	 	.	and	so	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	stand	back	,	you	see	213,000	vicodin	 pill 	 s 	 	,	which	is	the	number	of	hospital	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	room	 visit 	 s 	 	 year 	 ly 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	 attribut 	 able 	 	to	abuse	and	 mis 	 use 	 	of	prescription	 pain 	 killer 	 s 	 	and	anti	-	 anxie 	 ty 	 	 medic 	 ations 	 	.
one	-	third	of	all	drug	 over 	 dose 	 s 	 	in	the	u.s.	--	and	that	 include 	 s 	 	 coca 	 ine 	 	,	 hero 	 in 	 	,	alcohol	,	 every 	 thing 	 	--	one	-	third	of	drug	 over 	 dose 	 s 	 	are	prescription	 medic 	 ations 	 	.
a	strange	 phenomen 	 on 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	piece	that	i	just	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 complete 	 d 	 	about	 an 	 other 	 	tragic	 phenomen 	 on 	 	.	and	that	is	the	 phenomen 	 on 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	growing	obsession	we	have	with	breast	 augment 	 ation 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	.
384,000	women	,	american	women	,	last	year	went	in	for	 elect 	 ive 	 	breast	 augment 	 ation 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	.
it	's	 rapid 	 ly 	 	 be 	 coming 	 	the	most	popular	high	school	 gradu 	 ation 	 	gift	,	 give 	 n 	 	to	young	 girl 	 s 	 	who	are	about	to	go	off	to	college	.
so	,	i	made	 th 	 is 	 	image	out	of	barbie	 doll 	 s 	 	,	and	so	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	stand	back	you	see	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 flor 	 al 	 	pattern	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	you	get	all	the	way	back	,	you	see	32,000	barbie	 doll 	 s 	 	,	which	 represent 	 s 	 	the	number	of	breast	 augment 	 ation 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ries 	 	that	are	 perform 	 ed 	 	in	the	u.s.	each	month	.
the	vast	 major 	 ity 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	are	on	women	under	the	age	of	21	.
and	 strange 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	the	 on 	 ly 	 	plastic	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	that	is	more	popular	than	breast	 augment 	 ation 	 	is	 liposu 	 ction 	 	,	and	most	of	that	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	by	men	.
now	,	i	want	to	 emphas 	 ize 	 	that	these	are	just	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.	i	'm	not	 hold 	 ing 	 	these	out	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	.	they	're	just	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
and	the	reason	that	i	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	i	have	 th 	 is 	 	fear	that	we	are	n't	 feel 	 ing 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	culture	right	now	.
there	's	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 an 	 est 	 hesia 	 	in	america	at	the	moment	.
we	've	lost	our	sense	of	 out 	 rage 	 	,	our	anger	and	our	grief	about	what	's	going	on	in	our	culture	right	now	,	what	's	going	on	in	our	country	,	the	 atro 	 cities 	 	that	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 commit 	 ted 	 	in	our	 name 	 s 	 	around	the	world	.
they	've	gone	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	;	these	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	have	gone	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	.
our	cultural	joy	,	our	national	joy	is	 no 	 where 	 	to	be	 s 	 een 	 	.
and	one	of	the	 cause 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	think	,	is	that	 a 	 s 	 	each	of	us	 attempt 	 s 	 	to	build	 th 	 is 	 	new	kind	of	 world 	 view 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 hol 	 optical 	 	 world 	 view 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 holo 	 graphic 	 	image	that	we	're	all	 try 	 ing 	 	to	create	in	our	mind	of	the	 interconnect 	 ion 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	:	the	 environment 	 al 	 	 foot 	 print 	 s 	 	1,000	 mile 	 s 	 	away	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	buy	;	the	social	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	10,000	 mile 	 s 	 	away	of	the	 dai 	 ly 	 	 decision 	 s 	 	that	we	make	 a 	 s 	 	 consumer 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	we	try	to	build	 th 	 is 	 	view	,	and	try	to	 educ 	 ate 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	about	the	 e 	 norm 	 ity 	 	of	our	culture	,	the	information	that	we	have	to	work	with	is	these	 gig 	 antic 	 	 number 	 s 	 	:	 number 	 s 	 	in	the	 million 	 s 	 	,	in	the	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	,	in	the	 billion 	 s 	 	and	now	in	the	 trillion 	 s 	 	.
bush	's	new	budget	is	in	the	 trillion 	 s 	 	,	and	these	are	 number 	 s 	 	that	our	brain	just	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	the	ability	to	 com 	 prehend 	 	.
we	ca	n't	make	meaning	out	of	these	enormous	 statistic 	 s 	 	.
and	so	that	's	what	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	my	work	,	is	to	take	these	 number 	 s 	 	,	these	 statistic 	 s 	 	from	the	raw	language	of	data	,	and	to	 transl 	 ate 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	a	more	universal	visual	language	,	that	can	be	felt	.
 be 	 cause 	 	my	belief	is	,	if	we	can	feel	these	 issue 	 s 	 	,	if	we	can	feel	these	 thing 	 s 	 	more	 deep 	 ly 	 	,	then	they	'll	matter	to	us	more	than	they	do	now	.
and	if	we	can	find	that	,	then	we	'll	be	able	to	find	,	 with 	 in 	 	each	one	of	us	,	what	it	is	that	we	need	to	find	to	face	the	big	question	,	which	is	:	how	do	we	change	?
that	,	to	me	,	is	the	big	question	that	we	face	 a 	 s 	 	a	people	right	now	:
how	do	we	change	?	how	do	we	change	 a 	 s 	 	a	culture	,	and	how	do	we	each	 individual 	 ly 	 	take	 respons 	 ibility 	 	for	the	one	piece	of	the	solution	that	we	are	in	charge	of	,	and	that	is	our	own	behavior	?
my	belief	is	that	you	do	n't	have	to	make	 your 	 self 	 	bad	to	look	at	these	 issue 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	not	 point 	 ing 	 	the	finger	at	america	in	a	 b 	 lam 	 ing 	 	way	.	i	'm	 simpl 	 y 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	who	we	are	right	now	.
and	if	there	are	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	see	that	we	do	n't	like	about	our	culture	,	then	we	have	a	choice	.
the	degree	of	 integ 	 r 	 ity 	 	that	each	of	us	can	 br 	 ing 	 	to	the	surface	,	to	 br 	 ing 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	question	,	the	depth	of	character	that	we	can	summon	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	show	up	for	the	question	of	how	do	we	change	--
it	's	 al 	 ready 	 	 defi 	 ning 	 	us	 a 	 s 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	and	 a 	 s 	 	a	nation	,	and	it	will	 continu 	 e 	 	to	do	that	,	on	 in 	 to 	 	the	future	.
and	it	will	 pro 	 found 	 ly 	 	affect	the	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	,	the	quality	of	life	of	the	 billion 	 s 	 	of	people	who	are	going	to	inherit	the	 result 	 s 	 	of	our	 decision 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	not	 s 	 peaking 	 	 abstract 	 ly 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	'm	 s 	 peaking 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	who	we	are	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	,
right	now	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	moment	.
thank	you	and	good	afternoon	.
