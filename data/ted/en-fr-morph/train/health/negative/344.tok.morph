so	,	a	big	question	that	we	're	facing	now	and	have	 be 	 en 	 	for	 quit 	 e 	 	a	number	of	 year 	 s 	 	now	:	are	we	at	risk	of	a	nuclear	attack	?
now	,	there	's	a	 big 	 ger 	 	question	that	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	more	 import 	 ant 	 	than	that	,	is	the	 not 	 ion 	 	of	 permanent 	 ly 	 	 elimi 	 nating 	 	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	a	nuclear	attack	,	 elimi 	 nating 	 	the	threat	 al 	 together 	 	.
and	i	would	like	to	make	a	case	to	you	that	over	the	 year 	 s 	 	since	we	first	 develop 	 ed 	 	atomic	 weapon 	 ry 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	moment	,	we	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	lived	in	a	 danger 	 ous 	 	nuclear	world	that	's	 character 	 ized 	 	by	two	 phase 	 s 	 	,	which	i	'm	going	to	go	through	with	you	right	now	.
first	of	all	,	we	 start 	 ed 	 	off	the	nuclear	age	in	1945	.
the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	had	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	couple	of	atomic	 weapon 	 s 	 	through	the	manhattan	project	,	and	the	idea	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 straight 	 forward 	 	:	we	would	use	the	power	of	the	atom	to	end	the	 atro 	 cities 	 	and	the	 horr 	 or 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 un 	 end 	 ing 	 	world	war	ii	that	we	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	in	europe	and	in	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	.
and	in	1945	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	the	 on 	 ly 	 	nuclear	power	.
we	had	a	few	nuclear	 weapon 	 s 	 	,	two	of	which	we	 drop 	 ped 	 	on	japan	,	in	hiroshima	,	a	few	 day 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	in	nagasaki	,	in	august	1945	,	 kill 	 ing 	 	about	250,000	people	between	 t 	 hose 	 	two	.
and	for	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	the	 on 	 ly 	 	nuclear	power	on	earth	.
but	by	1949	,	the	soviet	 un 	 ion 	 	had	 decide 	 d 	 	it	was	 un 	 accept 	 able 	 	to	have	us	 a 	 s 	 	the	 on 	 ly 	 	nuclear	power	,	and	they	 beg 	 an 	 	to	match	what	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	had	 develop 	 ed 	 	.
and	from	1949	to	1985	was	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	time	of	a	 build 	 up 	 	of	a	nuclear	arsenal	that	no	one	could	possibly	have	 imagin 	 ed 	 	back	in	the	1940s	.
so	by	1985	--	each	of	 t 	 hose 	 	red	 bomb 	 s 	 	up	here	is	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	a	 thousand 	 s 	 	 war 	 head 	 s 	 	--
the	world	had	65,000	nuclear	 war 	 head 	 s 	 	,	and	seven	 member 	 s 	 	of	 some 	 thing 	 	that	came	to	be	known	 a 	 s 	 	the	``	nuclear	club	.	``
and	it	was	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	time	,	and	i	am	going	to	go	through	some	of	the	 ment 	 ality 	 	that	we	--	that	americans	and	the	rest	of	the	world	 we 	 re 	 	 ex 	 peri 	 encing 	 	.
but	i	want	to	just	point	out	to	you	that	95	percent	of	the	nuclear	 weapon 	 s 	 	at	any	 part 	 icular 	 	time	since	1985	--	going	forward	,	of	course	--	 we 	 re 	 	part	of	the	 arsenal 	 s 	 	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	and	the	soviet	 un 	 ion 	 	.
after	1985	,	and	before	the	break	up	of	the	soviet	 un 	 ion 	 	,	we	 beg 	 an 	 	to	 dis 	 arm 	 	from	a	nuclear	point	of	view	.
we	 beg 	 an 	 	to	counter	-	 pro 	 life 	 rate 	 	,	and	we	 drop 	 ped 	 	the	number	of	nuclear	 war 	 head 	 s 	 	in	the	world	to	about	a	total	of	21,000	.
it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	number	to	deal	with	,	 be 	 cause 	 	what	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	is	we	've	quote	 un 	 quote 	 	``	 de 	 commission 	 ed 	 	``	some	of	the	 war 	 head 	 s 	 	.
they	're	still	 prob 	 ably 	 	 us 	 able 	 	.	they	could	be	``	re	-	 commission 	 ed 	 	,	``	but	the	way	they	count	 thing 	 s 	 	,	which	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	,	we	think	we	have	about	a	third	of	the	nuclear	 weapon 	 s 	 	we	had	before	.
but	we	 al 	 so 	 	,	in	that	period	of	time	,	 add 	 ed 	 	two	more	 member 	 s 	 	to	the	nuclear	club	:	pakistan	and	north	korea	.
so	we	stand	 to 	 day 	 	with	a	still	fully	 arm 	 ed 	 	nuclear	arsenal	among	 man 	 y 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	around	the	world	,	but	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	set	of	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	.
so	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	a	nuclear	threat	story	in	two	 chapter 	 s 	 	.
chapter	one	is	1949	to	1991	,	when	the	soviet	 un 	 ion 	 	broke	up	,
and	what	we	 we 	 re 	 	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	,	at	that	point	and	through	 t 	 hose 	 	 year 	 s 	 	,	was	a	 super 	 power 	 s 	 	'	nuclear	 arm 	 s 	 	race	.
it	was	 character 	 ized 	 	by	a	nation	-	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	-	nation	,	 ver 	 y 	 	fragile	standoff	.
and	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	we	lived	for	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	some	might	 argu 	 e 	 	that	we	still	do	,	in	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	on	the	 br 	 ink 	 	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	of	an	 apocalyp 	 tic 	 	,	planetary	 calam 	 ity 	 	.
it	's	 in 	 credible 	 	that	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	lived	through	all	that	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 total 	 ly 	 	dependent	 dur 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 year 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	acronym	,	which	is	mad	.	it	 stand 	 s 	 	for	 mutual 	 ly 	 	 assur 	 ed 	 	 destruct 	 ion 	 	.
so	it	 me 	 ant 	 	if	you	 attack 	 ed 	 	us	,	we	would	attack	you	 virtual 	 ly 	 	 simultaneous 	 ly 	 	,	and	the	end	result	would	be	a	 destruct 	 ion 	 	of	your	country	and	mine	.
so	the	threat	of	my	own	 destruct 	 ion 	 	 ke 	 pt 	 	me	from	 launch 	 ing 	 	a	nuclear	attack	on	you	.	that	's	the	way	we	lived	.
and	the	danger	of	that	,	of	course	,	is	that	a	misreading	of	a	radar	screen	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	cause	a	counter	-	launch	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	the	first	country	had	not	 actual 	 ly 	 	 launch 	 ed 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	.
 dur 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	chapter	one	,	there	was	a	high	level	of	public	 aware 	 ness 	 	about	the	potential	of	nuclear	 catastroph 	 e 	 	,	and	an	 in 	 del 	 ible 	 	image	was	 implant 	 ed 	 	in	our	 collect 	 ive 	 	 mind 	 s 	 	that	,	in	fact	,	a	nuclear	 holo 	 caus 	 t 	 	would	be	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 global 	 ly 	 	 destruct 	 ive 	 	and	could	,	in	some	ways	,	mean	the	end	of	 civil 	 ization 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	know	it	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	was	chapter	one	.
now	the	odd	thing	is	that	even	 th 	 ough 	 	we	 k 	 new 	 	that	there	would	be	that	kind	of	 civil 	 ization 	 	obliteration	,	we	 engag 	 ed 	 	in	america	in	a	 s 	 eries 	 	--	and	in	fact	,	in	the	soviet	 un 	 ion 	 	--	in	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 respons 	 e 	 	 plan 	 ning 	 	.
it	was	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	.
so	 pre 	 mise 	 	one	is	we	'd	be	 destroy 	 ing 	 	the	world	,	and	then	 pre 	 mise 	 	two	is	,	why	do	n't	we	get	prepared	for	it	?
so	what	we	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	was	a	 collect 	 ion 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.	i	'm	just	going	to	go	skim	through	a	few	 thing 	 s 	 	,	just	to	jog	your	 memor 	 ies 	 	.
if	you	're	born	after	1950	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	--	consider	 th 	 is 	 	 entertain 	 ment 	 	,	 other 	 wise 	 	it	's	 memor 	 y 	 	lane	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	bert	the	turtle	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	 bas 	 ically 	 	an	attempt	to	teach	our	schoolchildren	that	if	we	did	get	 engag 	 ed 	 	in	a	nuclear	 confront 	 ation 	 	and	atomic	war	,	then	we	 want 	 ed 	 	our	school	children	to	kind	of	 bas 	 ically 	 	duck	and	cover	.
that	was	the	principle	.	you	--	there	would	be	a	nuclear	 con 	 flag 	 ration 	 	about	to	hit	us	,	and	if	you	get	under	your	desk	,	 thing 	 s 	 	would	be	ok	.
i	did	n't	do	all	that	well	in	 psych 	 iatry 	 	in	medical	school	,	but	i	was	 interest 	 ed 	 	,	and	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	was	 serious 	 ly 	 	 delusion 	 al 	 	.
 second 	 ly 	 	,	we	told	people	to	go	down	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 base 	 ments 	 	and	build	a	 fall 	 out 	 	shelter	.
 may 	 be 	 	it	would	be	a	 stud 	 y 	 	when	we	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 hav 	 ing 	 	an	atomic	war	,	or	you	could	use	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	tv	room	,	or	,	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 teenager 	 s 	 	found	out	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	safe	place	for	a	little	 pri 	 vac 	 y 	 	with	your	girlfriend	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	so	there	are	 multi 	 ple 	 	uses	of	the	bomb	 shelter 	 s 	 	.
or	you	could	buy	a	 pre 	 fabric 	 ated 	 	bomb	shelter	that	you	could	 simpl 	 y 	 	bury	in	the	ground	.
now	,	the	bomb	 shelter 	 s 	 	at	that	point	--	let	's	say	you	 b 	 ought 	 	a	 pre 	 fab 	 	one	--	it	would	be	a	few	hundred	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	up	to	500	,	if	you	got	a	 f 	 ancy 	 	one	.	yet	,	what	 percent 	 age 	 	of	americans	do	you	think	ever	had	a	bomb	shelter	in	 the 	 ir 	 	house	?
what	 percent 	 age 	 	lived	in	a	house	with	a	bomb	shelter	?
less	than	two	percent	.	about	1.4	percent	of	the	population	,	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	 any 	 one 	 	 know 	 s 	 	,	did	 any 	 thing 	 	,	either	making	a	space	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 base 	 ment 	 	or	 actual 	 ly 	 	building	a	bomb	shelter	.
 man 	 y 	 	 building 	 s 	 	,	public	 building 	 s 	 	,	around	the	country	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	new	york	city	--	had	these	little	civil	defense	 sign 	 s 	 	,	and	the	idea	was	that	you	would	run	 in 	 to 	 	one	of	these	 shelter 	 s 	 	and	be	safe	from	the	nuclear	 weapon 	 ry 	 	.
and	one	of	the	 great 	 est 	 	 government 	 al 	 	 delusion 	 s 	 	of	all	time	was	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	early	 day 	 s 	 	of	the	federal	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	management	 age 	 ncy 	 	,	fema	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	now	know	,	and	are	well	aware	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 behavior 	 s 	 	from	katrina	.
here	is	 the 	 ir 	 	first	big	public	 announce 	 ment 	 	.
they	would	 pro 	 pose 	 	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	there	 we 	 re 	 	about	six	 volume 	 s 	 	written	on	 th 	 is 	 	--	a	crisis	 re 	 location 	 	plan	that	was	dependent	 up 	 on 	 	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	three	to	four	 day 	 s 	 	 war 	 ning 	 	that	the	soviets	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	attack	us	.
so	the	goal	was	to	evacuate	the	target	cities	.
we	would	move	people	out	of	the	target	cities	 in 	 to 	 	the	 country 	 side 	 	.
and	i	'm	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	,	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	 test 	 ified 	 	at	the	senate	about	the	absolute	 ludicr 	 ous 	 	idea	that	we	would	 actual 	 ly 	 	evacuate	,	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	three	or	four	 day 	 s 	 	'	 war 	 ning 	 	.
it	was	just	 complete 	 ly 	 	off	the	wall	.
 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	they	had	 an 	 other 	 	idea	 be 	 hind 	 	it	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	 th 	 is 	 	was	--	they	 we 	 re 	 	 tell 	 ing 	 	the	public	it	was	to	 s 	 ave 	 	us	.
the	idea	was	that	we	would	force	the	soviets	to	re	-	target	 the 	 ir 	 	nuclear	 weapon 	 s 	 	--	 ver 	 y 	 	expensive	--	and	 potential 	 ly 	 	double	 the 	 ir 	 	arsenal	,	to	not	 on 	 ly 	 	take	out	the	original	 s 	 ite 	 	,	but	take	out	 s 	 ites 	 	where	people	 we 	 re 	 	going	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	what	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	was	 be 	 hind 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	was	just	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 frighten 	 ing 	 	.
the	main	point	here	is	we	 we 	 re 	 	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	a	complete	 dis 	 connect 	 	from	 re 	 ality 	 	.
the	civil	defense	 program 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 dis 	 connect 	 ed 	 	from	the	 re 	 ality 	 	of	what	we	'd	see	in	all	-	out	nuclear	war	.
so	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	like	 physician 	 s 	 	for	social	 respons 	 ibility 	 	,	around	1979	,	 start 	 ed 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	a	lot	 public 	 ly 	 	.
they	would	do	a	 bomb 	 ing 	 	run	.	they	'd	go	to	your	city	,	and	they	'd	say	,	``	here	's	a	map	of	your	city	.
here	's	what	's	going	to	happen	if	we	get	a	nuclear	hit	.	``
so	no	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	medical	 respons 	 e 	 	to	,	or	 meaning 	 ful 	 	 prepared 	 ness 	 	for	all	-	out	nuclear	war	.
so	we	had	to	prevent	nuclear	war	if	we	 expect 	 ed 	 	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 dis 	 connect 	 	was	never	 actual 	 ly 	 	resolved	.
and	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	was	--	when	we	get	in	to	chapter	two	of	the	nuclear	threat	era	,	which	 start 	 ed 	 	back	in	1945	.
chapter	two	 start 	 s 	 	in	1991	.
when	the	soviet	 un 	 ion 	 	broke	up	,	we	 effective 	 ly 	 	lost	that	 advers 	 ary 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	potential	 attack 	 er 	 	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	for	the	most	part	.
it	's	not	 complete 	 ly 	 	gone	.	i	'm	going	to	come	back	to	that	.
but	from	1991	through	the	present	time	,	 emphas 	 ized 	 	by	the	 attack 	 s 	 	of	2001	,	the	idea	of	an	all	-	out	nuclear	war	 ha 	 s 	 	 diminish 	 ed 	 	and	the	idea	of	a	single	event	,	act	of	nuclear	 terror 	 ism 	 	is	what	we	have	 in 	 stead 	 	.
 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	the	scenario	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 consider 	 ably 	 	,	the	fact	is	that	we	have	n't	 change 	 d 	 	our	mental	image	of	what	a	nuclear	war	 mean 	 s 	 	.
so	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	what	the	 implic 	 ations 	 	of	that	are	in	just	a	second	.
so	,	what	is	a	nuclear	terror	threat	?
and	there	's	four	key	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	to	 de 	 s 	 crib 	 ing 	 	that	.
first	thing	is	that	the	global	nuclear	 weapon 	 s 	 	,	in	the	 stock 	 pile 	 s 	 	that	i	 show 	 ed 	 	you	in	 t 	 hose 	 	original	 map 	 s 	 	,	happen	to	be	not	 uniform 	 ly 	 	secure	.
and	it	's	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	not	secure	in	the	 form 	 er 	 	soviet	 un 	 ion 	 	,	now	in	russia	.
there	are	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 s 	 ites 	 	where	 war 	 head 	 s 	 	are	 store 	 d 	 	and	,	in	fact	,	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 s 	 ites 	 	where	fissionable	 material 	 s 	 	,	like	 high 	 ly 	 	 enrich 	 ed 	 	 ur 	 an 	 ium 	 	and	 p 	 lu 	 ton 	 ium 	 	,	are	 absolute 	 ly 	 	not	safe	.
they	're	 avail 	 able 	 	to	be	 b 	 ought 	 	,	 stole 	 n 	 	,	 what 	 ever 	 	.
they	're	acquirable	,	let	me	put	it	that	way	.
from	1993	through	2006	,	the	 inter 	 national 	 	atomic	energy	 age 	 ncy 	 	 document 	 ed 	 	175	 case 	 s 	 	of	nuclear	 t 	 heft 	 	,	18	of	which	 involve 	 d 	 	 high 	 ly 	 	 enrich 	 ed 	 	 ur 	 an 	 ium 	 	or	 p 	 lu 	 ton 	 ium 	 	,	the	key	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	to	make	a	nuclear	weapon	.
the	global	 stock 	 pile 	 	of	 high 	 ly 	 	 enrich 	 ed 	 	 ur 	 an 	 ium 	 	is	about	1,300	,	at	the	low	end	,	to	about	2,100	metric	 ton 	 s 	 	.
more	than	100	 mega 	 ton 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	 store 	 d 	 	in	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 in 	 secure 	 	russian	 facil 	 ities 	 	.
how	much	of	that	do	you	think	it	would	take	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	build	a	10	-	kiloton	bomb	?
well	,	you	need	about	75	 pound 	 s 	 	of	it	.
so	,	what	i	'd	like	to	show	you	is	what	it	would	take	to	hold	75	 pound 	 s 	 	of	 high 	 ly 	 	 enrich 	 ed 	 	 ur 	 an 	 ium 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	product	placement	.	it	's	just	--	in	fact	,	if	i	was	coca	 col 	 a 	 	,	i	'd	be	 pre 	 tty 	 	 di 	 stress 	 ed 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	--	--	but	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	you	would	need	to	steal	or	buy	out	of	that	100	-	metric	-	ton	 stock 	 pile 	 	that	's	 relat 	 ively 	 	 in 	 secure 	 	to	create	the	type	of	bomb	that	was	used	in	hiroshima	.
now	you	might	want	to	look	at	 p 	 lu 	 ton 	 ium 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 an 	 other 	 	fissionable	material	that	you	might	use	in	a	bomb	.
that	--	you	'd	need	10	to	13	 pound 	 s 	 	of	 p 	 lu 	 ton 	 ium 	 	.
now	,	 p 	 lu 	 ton 	 ium 	 	,	10	to	13	 pound 	 s 	 	:	 th 	 is 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 en 	 ough 	 	 p 	 lu 	 ton 	 ium 	 	to	create	a	nagasaki	-	 s 	 ize 	 	atomic	weapon	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	 al 	 ready 	 	i	--	you	know	,	i	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	like	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	 some 	 how 	 	i	got	 my 	 self 	 	a	job	where	i	have	to	think	about	it	.	so	the	point	is	that	we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 in 	 secure 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 develop 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	material	.
the	second	thing	is	,	what	about	the	know	-	how	?
and	there	's	a	lot	of	 contr 	 over 	 s 	 y 	 	about	 whet 	 her 	 	terror	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	have	the	know	-	how	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	make	a	nuclear	weapon	.
well	,	there	's	a	lot	of	know	-	how	out	there	.
there	's	an	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	amount	of	know	-	how	out	there	.
there	's	 detail 	 ed 	 	information	on	how	to	assemble	a	nuclear	weapon	from	 part 	 s 	 	.
there	's	 book 	 s 	 	about	how	to	build	a	nuclear	bomb	.
there	are	 plan 	 s 	 	for	how	to	create	a	terror	farm	where	you	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	 manufactur 	 e 	 	and	develop	all	the	 component 	 s 	 	and	assemble	it	.
all	of	 th 	 is 	 	information	is	 relat 	 ively 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	.
if	you	have	an	 under 	 graduate 	 	degree	in	physics	,	i	would	suggest	--	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	i	do	n't	,	so	 may 	 be 	 	it	's	not	even	true	--	but	 some 	 thing 	 	close	to	that	would	allow	you	,	with	the	information	that	's	 current 	 ly 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	,	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	build	a	nuclear	weapon	.
the	third	element	of	the	nuclear	terror	threat	is	that	,	who	would	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	 s 	 uch 	 	a	thing	?
well	,	what	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	now	is	a	level	of	 terror 	 ism 	 	that	 involve 	 s 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	who	are	 high 	 ly 	 	 organize 	 d 	 	.
they	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 dedicate 	 d 	 	and	 commit 	 ted 	 	.
they	are	stateless	.
 some 	 body 	 	once	 s 	 aid 	 	,	al	qaeda	 do 	 es 	 	not	have	a	return	address	,	so	if	they	attack	us	with	a	nuclear	weapon	,	what	's	the	 respons 	 e 	 	,	and	to	whom	is	the	 respons 	 e 	 	?
and	they	're	 retali 	 ation 	 	-	proof	.
since	there	is	no	real	 re 	 trib 	 ution 	 	possible	that	would	make	any	 differ 	 ence 	 	,	since	there	are	people	 will 	 ing 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	give	up	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	in	order	to	do	a	lot	of	damage	to	us	,	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 ap 	 parent 	 	that	the	whole	 not 	 ion 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 mutual 	 ly 	 	 assur 	 ed 	 	 destruct 	 ion 	 	would	not	work	.
here	is	sulaiman	abu	ghaith	,	and	sulaiman	was	a	key	lieutenant	of	osama	bin	laden	.
he	wrote	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	 state 	 ments 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	effect	:	``	we	have	the	right	to	kill	four	million	americans	,	two	million	of	whom	should	be	children	.	``
and	we	do	n't	have	to	go	 over 	 sea 	 s 	 	to	find	people	 will 	 ing 	 	to	do	harm	,	for	 what 	 ever 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	.
mcveigh	and	nichols	,	and	the	oklahoma	city	attack	in	the	1990s	was	a	good	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 home 	 grown 	 	 terrorist 	 s 	 	.
what	if	they	had	gotten	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	on	a	nuclear	weapon	?
the	fourth	element	is	that	the	high	-	value	u.s.	 target 	 s 	 	are	 access 	 ible 	 	,	soft	and	 ple 	 nt 	 iful 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	would	be	a	talk	for	 an 	 other 	 	day	,	but	the	level	of	the	 prepared 	 ness 	 	that	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 achiev 	 ed 	 	since	9/11	of	'01	is	 un 	 believ 	 ably 	 	 in 	 ad 	 equate 	 	.
what	you	saw	after	katrina	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 indic 	 ator 	 	of	how	little	prepared	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	is	for	any	kind	of	major	attack	.
seven	million	ship	 car 	 go 	 	 contain 	 ers 	 	come	 in 	 to 	 	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	every	year	.
five	to	seven	percent	 on 	 ly 	 	are	 inspect 	 ed 	 	--	five	to	seven	percent	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	alexander	lebed	,	who	was	a	general	that	 work 	 ed 	 	with	yeltsin	,	who	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	,	and	 present 	 ed 	 	to	congress	,	 th 	 is 	 	idea	that	the	russians	had	 develop 	 ed 	 	--	these	 suit 	 case 	 	 bomb 	 s 	 	.	they	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	low	yield	--	0.1	to	one	kiloton	,	hiroshima	was	around	13	 kilo 	 ton 	 s 	 	--	but	 en 	 ough 	 	to	do	an	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	amount	of	damage	.
and	lebed	came	to	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	and	told	us	that	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	--	more	than	80	of	the	 suit 	 case 	 	 bomb 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	not	 account 	 able 	 	.
and	they	look	like	 th 	 is 	 	.	they	're	 bas 	 ically 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 arrange 	 ments 	 	.
you	put	the	 element 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 suit 	 case 	 	.
it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 port 	 able 	 	.
the	 suit 	 case 	 	can	be	 convenient 	 ly 	 	 drop 	 ped 	 	in	your	trunk	of	your	car	.
you	take	it	 where 	 ver 	 	you	want	to	take	it	,	and	you	can	 de 	 ton 	 ate 	 	it	.
you	do	n't	want	to	build	a	 suit 	 case 	 	bomb	,	and	you	happen	to	get	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 in 	 secure 	 	nuclear	 war 	 head 	 s 	 	that	exist	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	``	little	boy	``	bomb	that	was	 drop 	 ped 	 	at	hiroshima	.
it	was	9.8	feet	long	,	 weigh 	 ed 	 	8,800	 pound 	 s 	 	.	you	go	down	to	your	local	rent	-	a	-	truck	and	for	50	 buck 	 s 	 	or	so	,	you	rent	a	truck	that	's	got	the	right	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	,	and	you	take	your	bomb	,	you	put	it	in	the	truck	and	you	're	ready	to	go	.
it	could	happen	.	but	what	it	would	mean	and	who	would	 surviv 	 e 	 	?
you	ca	n't	get	an	exact	number	for	that	kind	of	 prob 	 ability 	 	,	but	what	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	say	is	that	we	have	all	the	 element 	 s 	 	of	that	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
 any 	 body 	 	who	dismisses	the	thought	of	a	nuclear	weapon	 be 	 ing 	 	used	by	a	terrorist	is	 kid 	 d 	 ing 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
i	think	there	's	a	lot	of	people	in	the	 intellig 	 ence 	 	community	--	a	lot	of	people	who	deal	with	 th 	 is 	 	work	in	general	think	it	's	 al 	 most 	 	 inevit 	 able 	 	,	 un 	 less 	 	we	do	certain	 thing 	 s 	 	to	 re 	 ally 	 	try	to	defuse	the	risk	,	like	better	interdiction	,	better	 prevent 	 ion 	 	,	better	 fix 	 ing 	 	,	you	know	,	better	 screen 	 ing 	 	of	 car 	 go 	 	 contain 	 ers 	 	that	are	coming	 in 	 to 	 	the	country	and	so	forth	.
there	's	a	lot	that	can	be	 d 	 one 	 	to	make	us	a	lot	 safe 	 r 	 	.
at	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	moment	,	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	could	end	up	 see 	 ing 	 	a	nuclear	detonation	in	one	of	our	cities	.
i	do	n't	think	we	would	see	an	all	-	out	nuclear	war	any	time	soon	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	even	that	is	not	 complete 	 ly 	 	off	the	table	.
there	's	still	 en 	 ough 	 	nuclear	 weapon 	 s 	 	in	the	 arsenal 	 s 	 	of	the	 super 	 power 	 s 	 	to	destroy	the	earth	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	over	.
there	are	flash	 point 	 s 	 	in	india	and	pakistan	,	in	the	middle	east	,	in	north	korea	,	other	 place 	 s 	 	where	the	use	of	nuclear	 weapon 	 s 	 	,	while	 initi 	 ally 	 	 local 	 ly 	 	,	could	 ver 	 y 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	where	we	'd	be	facing	all	-	out	nuclear	war	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 settl 	 ing 	 	.
here	we	go	.	ok	.
i	'm	back	in	my	truck	,	and	we	drove	over	the	brooklyn	bridge	.
we	're	coming	down	,	and	we	 br 	 ing 	 	that	truck	that	you	just	saw	 some 	 where 	 	in	here	,	in	the	financial	 di 	 strict 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	10	-	kiloton	bomb	,	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 small 	 er 	 	than	was	used	in	hiroshima	.	and	i	want	to	just	conclude	 th 	 is 	 	by	just	giving	you	some	information	.	i	think	--	``	news	you	could	use	``	kind	of	 con 	 cept 	 	here	.
so	,	first	of	all	,	 th 	 is 	 	would	be	 horr 	 ific 	 	beyond	 any 	 thing 	 	we	can	possibly	imagine	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	ultimate	.
and	if	you	're	in	the	half	-	mile	 radi 	 us 	 	of	where	 th 	 is 	 	bomb	went	off	,	you	have	a	90	percent	chance	of	not	making	it	.
if	you	're	right	where	the	bomb	went	off	,	you	will	be	 vapor 	 ized 	 	.	and	that	's	--	i	'm	just	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	good	.
you	 assum 	 e 	 	that	.
two	-	mile	 radi 	 us 	 	,	you	have	a	50	percent	chance	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 kill 	 ed 	 	,	and	up	to	about	eight	 mile 	 s 	 	away	--	now	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 kill 	 ed 	 	 instant 	 ly 	 	--	 some 	 where 	 	between	a	10	and	20	percent	chance	of	 get 	 ting 	 	 kill 	 ed 	 	.
the	thing	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	the	experience	of	the	nuclear	detonation	is	--	first	of	all	,	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	 degree 	 s 	 	fahrenheit	at	the	core	here	,	where	it	 go 	 es 	 	off	,	and	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	amount	of	energy	in	the	form	of	heat	,	 a 	 cute 	 	 radi 	 ation 	 	and	blast	 effect 	 s 	 	.
an	enormous	hurricane	-	like	wind	,	and	 destruct 	 ion 	 	of	 building 	 s 	 	 al 	 most 	 	 total 	 ly 	 	,	 with 	 in 	 	 th 	 is 	 	yellow	circle	here	.
and	what	i	'm	going	to	focus	on	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	come	to	 con 	 clusion 	 	here	,	is	that	,	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	you	if	you	're	in	here	?
well	,	if	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	old	 day 	 s 	 	of	an	all	-	out	nuclear	attack	,	you	,	up	here	,	are	 a 	 s 	 	dead	 a 	 s 	 	the	people	here	.	so	it	was	a	moot	point	.
my	point	now	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	is	that	there	is	a	lot	that	we	could	do	for	you	who	are	in	here	,	if	you	've	 surviv 	 ed 	 	the	 initi 	 al 	 	blast	.
you	have	,	when	the	blast	 go 	 es 	 	off	--	and	by	the	way	,	if	it	ever	 come 	 s 	 	up	,	do	n't	look	at	it	.
if	you	look	at	it	,	you	're	going	to	be	blind	,	either	 tempor 	 arily 	 	or	 permanent 	 ly 	 	.
so	if	there	's	any	way	that	you	can	avoid	,	like	,	 a 	 vert 	 	your	 eye 	 s 	 	,	that	would	be	a	good	thing	.
if	you	find	 your 	 self 	 	 al 	 ive 	 	,	but	you	're	in	the	 vic 	 in 	 ity 	 	of	a	nuclear	weapon	,	you	have	--	that	's	gone	off	--	you	have	10	to	20	 minute 	 s 	 	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	the	 s 	 ize 	 	and	 exact 	 ly 	 	where	it	went	off	,	to	get	out	of	the	way	before	a	lethal	amount	of	 radi 	 ation 	 	 come 	 s 	 	straight	down	from	the	mushroom	cloud	that	 go 	 es 	 	up	.
in	that	10	to	15	 minute 	 s 	 	,	all	you	have	to	do	--	and	i	mean	 th 	 is 	 	 serious 	 ly 	 	--	is	go	about	a	mile	away	from	the	blast	.	and	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	--	i	'm	going	to	show	you	now	some	 fall 	 out 	 	 plume 	 s 	 	.	 with 	 in 	 	20	 minute 	 s 	 	,	it	 come 	 s 	 	straight	down	.	 with 	 in 	 	24	 hour 	 s 	 	,	lethal	 radi 	 ation 	 	is	going	out	with	 prevail 	 ing 	 	 wind 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	 most 	 ly 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	direction	--	it	's	going	 north 	 east 	 	.
and	if	you	're	in	 th 	 is 	 	 vic 	 in 	 ity 	 	,	you	've	got	to	get	away	.
so	you	're	 feel 	 ing 	 	the	wind	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	tremendous	wind	now	that	you	're	going	to	be	 feel 	 ing 	 	--	and	you	want	to	go	 per 	 pend 	 icular 	 	to	the	wind	or	 down 	 wind 	 	,	if	you	are	in	fact	able	to	see	where	the	blast	was	in	front	of	you	.
you	've	got	to	get	out	of	there	.
if	you	do	n't	get	out	of	there	,	you	're	going	to	be	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	to	lethal	 radi 	 ation 	 	in	 ver 	 y 	 	short	order	.
if	you	ca	n't	get	out	of	there	,	we	want	you	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	a	shelter	and	stay	there	.
now	,	in	a	shelter	in	an	urban	area	 mean 	 s 	 	you	have	to	be	either	in	a	 base 	 ment 	 	 a 	 s 	 	deep	 a 	 s 	 	possible	,	or	you	have	to	be	on	a	floor	--	on	a	high	floor	--	if	it	's	a	ground	burst	explosion	,	which	it	would	be	,	 high 	 er 	 	than	the	 n 	 in 	 th 	 	floor	.	so	you	have	to	be	tenth	floor	or	 high 	 er 	 	,	or	in	the	 base 	 ment 	 	.
but	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	you	've	got	to	get	out	of	town	 a 	 s 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	possible	.
and	if	you	do	that	,	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	can	 surviv 	 e 	 	a	nuclear	blast	.
over	the	next	few	 day 	 s 	 	to	a	week	,	there	will	be	a	 radi 	 ation 	 	cloud	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	going	with	the	wind	,	and	 settl 	 ing 	 	down	for	 an 	 other 	 	15	or	20	 mile 	 s 	 	out	--	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	over	long	 is 	 land 	 	.
and	if	you	're	in	the	direct	 fall 	 out 	 	zone	here	,	you	 re 	 ally 	 	have	to	either	be	 shelter 	 ed 	 	or	you	have	to	get	out	of	there	,	and	that	's	clear	.	but	if	you	are	 shelter 	 ed 	 	,	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	 surviv 	 e 	 	.
the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	 know 	 ing 	 	information	of	what	you	're	going	to	do	 personal 	 ly 	 	,	and	not	 know 	 ing 	 	information	,	can	 s 	 ave 	 	your	life	,	and	it	could	mean	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	150,000	to	200,000	 fatal 	 ities 	 	from	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	and	half	a	million	to	700,000	 fatal 	 ities 	 	.
so	,	 respons 	 e 	 	 plan 	 ning 	 	in	the	twenty	-	first	century	is	both	possible	and	is	essential	.
but	in	2008	,	there	is	n't	one	single	american	city	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	effective	 plan 	 s 	 	to	deal	with	a	nuclear	detonation	disaster	.
part	of	the	problem	is	that	the	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	 plan 	 ner 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	 personal 	 ly 	 	,	are	 overwhelm 	 ed 	 	 psycho 	 logically 	 	by	the	thought	of	nuclear	 catastroph 	 e 	 	.
they	are	 paralyze 	 d 	 	.
you	say	``	nuclear	``	to	them	,	and	they	're	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	oh	my	god	,	we	're	all	gone	.	what	's	the	point	?	it	's	 fu 	 tile 	 	.	``
and	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	tell	them	,	``	it	's	not	 fu 	 tile 	 	.	we	can	change	the	 surviv 	 al 	 	rates	by	 do 	 ing 	 	some	 common 	 sens 	 ical 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.	``
so	the	goal	here	is	to	 minim 	 ize 	 	 fatal 	 ities 	 	.
and	i	just	want	to	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	the	personal	 point 	 s 	 	that	i	think	you	might	be	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	.
the	key	to	 surviv 	 ing 	 	a	nuclear	blast	is	 get 	 ting 	 	out	,	and	not	going	 in 	 to 	 	harm	's	way	.
that	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	all	we	're	going	to	be	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	here	.
and	the	 far 	 ther 	 	you	are	away	in	distance	,	the	 long 	 er 	 	it	is	in	time	from	the	 initi 	 al 	 	blast	;	and	the	more	 separat 	 ion 	 	between	you	and	the	 out 	 side 	 	atmosphere	,	the	better	.
so	 separat 	 ion 	 	--	 hope 	 fully 	 	with	dirt	or	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	,	or	 be 	 ing 	 	in	a	 base 	 ment 	 	--	distance	and	time	is	what	will	 s 	 ave 	 	you	.
so	here	's	what	you	do	.	first	of	all	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	do	n't	 star 	 e 	 	at	the	light	flash	,	if	you	can	.	i	do	n't	know	you	could	possibly	resist	 do 	 ing 	 	that	.
but	let	's	 assum 	 e 	 	,	 theoretic 	 ally 	 	,	you	want	to	do	that	.
you	want	to	keep	your	mouth	open	,	so	your	 ear 	 drum 	 s 	 	do	n't	burst	from	the	 pressure 	 s 	 	.
if	you	're	 ver 	 y 	 	close	to	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	have	to	duck	and	cover	,	like	bert	told	you	,	bert	the	turtle	.
and	you	want	to	get	under	 some 	 thing 	 	so	that	you	're	not	 inju 	 red 	 	or	 kill 	 ed 	 	by	 object 	 s 	 	,	if	that	's	at	all	possible	.
you	want	to	get	away	from	the	 initi 	 al 	 	 fall 	 out 	 	mushroom	cloud	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	in	just	a	few	 minute 	 s 	 	.	and	shelter	and	place	.	you	want	to	move	 down 	 wind 	 	or	crosswind	for	1.2	 mile 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	if	you	're	out	there	and	you	see	 building 	 s 	 	 horr 	 ibly 	 	 destroy 	 ed 	 	and	down	in	that	direction	,	less	 destroy 	 ed 	 	here	,	then	you	know	that	it	was	over	there	,	the	blast	,	and	you	're	going	 th 	 is 	 	way	,	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	you	're	going	crosswise	to	the	wind	.
once	you	're	out	and	evacuating	,	you	want	to	keep	 a 	 s 	 	much	of	your	skin	,	your	mouth	and	nose	 cover 	 ed 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	that	 cover 	 ing 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	impede	you	moving	and	 get 	 ting 	 	out	of	there	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	you	want	to	get	decontaminated	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	possible	.
and	if	you	're	 wear 	 ing 	 	 cloth 	 ing 	 	,	you	've	taken	off	your	 cloth 	 ing 	 	,	you	're	going	to	get	 shower 	 ed 	 	down	some	place	and	 re 	 move 	 	the	 radi 	 ation 	 	that	would	be	--	the	 radio 	 active 	 	material	that	might	be	on	you	.
and	then	you	want	to	stay	in	shelter	for	48	to	72	 hour 	 s 	 	 minim 	 um 	 	,	but	you	're	going	to	wait	 hope 	 fully 	 	--	you	'll	have	your	little	wind	-	up	,	 batt 	 ery 	 	-	less	radio	,	and	you	'll	be	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	people	to	tell	you	when	it	's	safe	to	go	 out 	 side 	 	.	that	's	what	you	need	to	do	.
in	 con 	 clusion 	 	,	nuclear	war	is	less	 like 	 ly 	 	than	before	,	but	by	no	 mean 	 s 	 	out	of	the	question	,	and	it	's	not	survivable	.
nuclear	 terror 	 ism 	 	is	possible	--	it	may	be	 prob 	 able 	 	--	but	is	survivable	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	jack	geiger	,	who	's	one	of	the	heroes	of	the	u.s.	public	health	community	.
