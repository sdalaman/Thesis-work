when	i	look	around	 th 	 is 	 	tedxamsterdam	venue	,	i	see	a	 ver 	 y 	 	special	audience	.
you	are	the	reason	why	i	 s 	 aid 	 	 y 	 es 	 	to	the	 invit 	 ation 	 	to	come	here	 to 	 day 	 	.
when	i	look	around	,	i	see	people	who	want	to	make	a	 con 	 trib 	 ution 	 	,	i	see	people	who	want	to	make	a	better	world	,	by	 do 	 ing 	 	 ground 	 break 	 ing 	 	scientific	work	,	by	creating	 impress 	 ive 	 	 work 	 s 	 	of	art	,	by	writing	critical	 article 	 s 	 	or	inspiring	 book 	 s 	 	,	by	 start 	 ing 	 	up	 sustain 	 able 	 	 business 	 es 	 	.
and	you	all	have	 chose 	 n 	 	your	own	 instrument 	 s 	 	to	fulfill	 th 	 is 	 	mission	of	creating	a	better	world	.

 other 	 s 	 	chose	 danc 	 ing 	 	or	 paint 	 ing 	 	or	making	music	like	we	just	heard	.
some	chose	the	pen	.
 other 	 s 	 	work	through	the	instrument	of	money	.
 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	i	made	a	different	choice	.
 thank 	 s 	 	.
 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	--	i	share	your	 goal 	 s 	 	.
i	share	the	 goal 	 s 	 	of	the	 speaker 	 s 	 	you	heard	before	.
i	did	not	 choos 	 e 	 	to	take	up	the	pen	,	the	brush	,	the	camera	.
i	chose	 th 	 is 	 	instrument	.
i	chose	the	gun	.
for	you	,	and	you	heard	 al 	 ready 	 	,	 be 	 ing 	 	so	close	to	 th 	 is 	 	gun	may	make	you	feel	 un 	 easy 	 	.
it	may	even	feel	 scar 	 y 	 	.
a	real	gun	at	a	few	feet	's	distance	.
let	us	stop	for	a	moment	and	feel	 th 	 is 	 	 uneasi 	 ness 	 	.
you	could	even	hear	it	.
let	us	 cher 	 ish 	 	the	fact	that	 prob 	 ably 	 	most	of	you	have	never	 be 	 en 	 	close	to	a	gun	.
it	 mean 	 s 	 	the	netherlands	is	a	 peace 	 ful 	 	country	.
the	netherlands	is	not	at	war	.
it	 mean 	 s 	 	 soldier 	 s 	 	are	not	 need 	 ed 	 	to	patrol	our	 street 	 s 	 	.
 gun 	 s 	 	are	not	a	part	of	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
in	 man 	 y 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	it	is	a	different	story	.
in	 man 	 y 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	people	are	 confront 	 ed 	 	with	 gun 	 s 	 	.
they	are	 oppress 	 ed 	 	.
they	are	 intimid 	 ated 	 	--	by	 war 	 lord 	 s 	 	,	by	 terrorist 	 s 	 	,	by	 criminal 	 s 	 	.
 weapon 	 s 	 	can	do	a	lot	of	harm	.
they	are	the	cause	of	much	 di 	 stress 	 	.
why	then	am	i	 stand 	 ing 	 	before	you	with	 th 	 is 	 	weapon	?
why	did	i	 choos 	 e 	 	the	gun	 a 	 s 	 	my	instrument	?
 to 	 day 	 	i	want	to	tell	you	why	.
 to 	 day 	 	i	want	to	tell	you	why	i	chose	the	gun	to	create	a	better	world	.
and	i	want	to	tell	you	how	 th 	 is 	 	gun	can	help	.
my	story	 start 	 s 	 	in	the	city	of	nijmegen	in	the	east	of	the	netherlands	,	the	city	where	i	was	born	.
my	father	was	a	 hard 	 work 	 ing 	 	 bake 	 r 	 	,	but	when	he	had	 finish 	 ed 	 	work	in	the	 bake 	 ry 	 	,	he	often	told	me	and	my	brother	 st 	 ories 	 	.
and	most	of	the	time	,	he	told	me	 th 	 is 	 	story	i	'm	going	to	share	with	you	now	.
the	story	of	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	when	he	was	a	 con 	 script 	 ed 	 	soldier	in	the	dutch	 arm 	 ed 	 	 force 	 s 	 	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	second	world	war	.
the	nazis	 invad 	 ed 	 	the	netherlands	.
 the 	 ir 	 	grim	 plan 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	evident	.
they	 me 	 ant 	 	to	rule	by	 mean 	 s 	 	of	 repress 	 ion 	 	.
 diploma 	 cy 	 	had	 fail 	 ed 	 	to	stop	the	germans	.
 on 	 ly 	 	brute	force	 remain 	 ed 	 	.
it	was	our	last	resort	.
my	father	was	there	to	provide	it	.
 a 	 s 	 	the	son	of	a	 farm 	 er 	 	who	 k 	 new 	 	how	to	hunt	,	my	father	was	an	 excel 	 lent 	 	 mark 	 s 	 man 	 	.
when	he	 aim 	 ed 	 	,	he	never	 mis 	 s 	 ed 	 	.
at	 th 	 is 	 	 decis 	 ive 	 	moment	in	dutch	 histo 	 ry 	 	my	father	was	 position 	 ed 	 	on	the	bank	of	the	river	waal	near	the	city	of	nijmegen	.
he	had	a	clear	shot	at	the	german	 soldier 	 s 	 	who	came	to	occupy	a	free	country	,	his	country	,	our	country	.
he	 fire 	 d 	 	.	 noth 	 ing 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
he	 fire 	 d 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
no	german	soldier	fell	to	the	ground	.
my	father	had	 be 	 en 	 	 give 	 n 	 	an	old	gun	that	could	not	even	reach	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	 river 	 bank 	 	.
hitler	's	 troop 	 s 	 	 march 	 ed 	 	on	,	and	there	was	 noth 	 ing 	 	my	father	could	do	about	it	.
 un 	 til 	 	the	day	my	father	 di 	 ed 	 	,	he	was	 frust 	 rated 	 	about	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	these	 shot 	 s 	 	.
he	could	have	 d 	 one 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	.
but	with	an	old	gun	,	not	even	the	best	 mark 	 s 	 man 	 	in	the	 arm 	 ed 	 	 force 	 s 	 	could	have	hit	the	mark	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	story	 stay 	 ed 	 	with	me	.
then	in	high	school	,	i	was	 grip 	 ped 	 	by	the	 st 	 ories 	 	of	the	 all 	 ied 	 	 soldier 	 s 	 	--	 soldier 	 s 	 	who	left	the	 safe 	 ty 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 home 	 s 	 	and	 risk 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	to	liberate	a	country	and	a	people	that	they	did	n't	know	.
they	 liberate 	 d 	 	my	birth	town	.
it	was	then	that	i	 decide 	 d 	 	i	would	take	up	the	gun	--	out	of	respect	and	 grat 	 itude 	 	for	 t 	 hose 	 	men	and	women	who	came	to	liberate	us	--	from	the	 aware 	 ness 	 	that	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	the	gun	can	stand	between	good	and	 e 	 vil 	 	.
and	that	is	why	i	took	up	the	gun	--	not	to	shoot	,	not	to	kill	,	not	to	destroy	,	but	to	stop	 t 	 hose 	 	who	would	do	 e 	 vil 	 	,	to	protect	the	 vulner 	 able 	 	,	to	defend	 democrat 	 ic 	 	 value 	 s 	 	,	to	stand	up	for	the	 free 	 dom 	 	we	have	to	talk	here	 to 	 day 	 	in	amsterdam	about	how	we	can	make	the	world	a	better	place	.
 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	i	do	not	stand	here	 to 	 day 	 	to	tell	you	about	the	 glor 	 y 	 	of	 weapon 	 s 	 	.
i	do	not	like	 gun 	 s 	 	.
and	once	you	have	 be 	 en 	 	under	fire	 your 	 self 	 	,	it	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	home	even	more	 clear 	 ly 	 	that	a	gun	is	not	some	 ma 	 cho 	 	instrument	to	brag	about	.
i	stand	here	 to 	 day 	 	to	tell	you	about	the	use	of	the	gun	 a 	 s 	 	an	instrument	of	peace	and	 st 	 ability 	 	.
the	gun	may	be	one	of	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 instrument 	 s 	 	of	peace	and	 st 	 ability 	 	that	we	have	in	 th 	 is 	 	world	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	may	sound	 contradict 	 ory 	 	to	you	.
but	not	 on 	 ly 	 	have	i	 s 	 een 	 	with	my	own	 eye 	 s 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	my	 deploy 	 ments 	 	in	lebanon	,	sarajevo	and	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	national	 a 	 s 	 	the	netherlands	'	chief	of	defense	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	 support 	 ed 	 	by	cold	,	hard	 statistic 	 s 	 	.
violence	 ha 	 s 	 	 decline 	 d 	 	 dramat 	 ically 	 	over	the	last	500	 year 	 s 	 	.
 de 	 spite 	 	the	 picture 	 s 	 	we	are	 show 	 n 	 	 dai 	 ly 	 	in	the	news	,	 war 	 s 	 	between	 develop 	 ed 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	are	no	 long 	 er 	 	 common 	 place 	 	.
the	murder	rate	in	europe	 ha 	 s 	 	 drop 	 ped 	 	by	a	factor	of	30	since	the	middle	 age 	 s 	 	.
and	 occur 	 rence 	 s 	 	of	civil	war	and	 repress 	 ion 	 	have	 decline 	 d 	 	since	the	end	of	the	cold	war	.
 statistic 	 s 	 	show	that	we	are	living	in	a	 relat 	 ively 	 	 peace 	 ful 	 	era	.
why	?
why	 ha 	 s 	 	violence	 de 	 crease 	 d 	 	?
 ha 	 s 	 	the	human	mind	 change 	 d 	 	?
well	we	 we 	 re 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	on	the	human	mind	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
did	we	 simpl 	 y 	 	lose	our	 beast 	 ly 	 	 impulse 	 s 	 	for	 re 	 venge 	 	,	for	violent	 ritual 	 s 	 	,	for	 pur 	 e 	 	rage	?
or	is	there	 some 	 thing 	 	else	?
in	his	 lat 	 est 	 	book	,	harvard	professor	steven	pinker	--	and	 man 	 y 	 	other	 think 	 ers 	 	before	him	--	 conclude 	 s 	 	that	one	of	the	main	 driver 	 s 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	less	violent	 socie 	 ties 	 	is	the	spread	of	the	 constit 	 ution 	 al 	 	state	and	the	 introduc 	 tion 	 	on	a	large	scale	of	the	state	 monopol 	 y 	 	on	the	 legitimize 	 d 	 	use	of	violence	--	 legitimize 	 d 	 	by	a	 democrat 	 ically 	 	 elect 	 ed 	 	government	,	 legitimize 	 d 	 	by	 check 	 s 	 	and	 balance 	 s 	 	and	an	 in 	 dependent 	 	 judi 	 cial 	 	system	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	a	state	 monopol 	 y 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	the	use	of	violence	well	under	control	.
 s 	 uch 	 	a	state	 monopol 	 y 	 	on	violence	,	first	of	all	,	 serve 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 re 	 assurance 	 	.
it	 re 	 move 	 s 	 	the	incentive	for	an	 arm 	 s 	 	race	between	 potential 	 ly 	 	 hostil 	 e 	 	 group 	 s 	 	in	our	 socie 	 ties 	 	.
 second 	 ly 	 	,	the	presence	of	 penal 	 ties 	 	that	outweigh	the	 benefit 	 s 	 	of	using	violence	 tip 	 s 	 	the	balance	even	further	.
abstaining	from	violence	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	more	 profit 	 able 	 	than	 start 	 ing 	 	a	war	.
now	 non 	 violence 	 	 start 	 s 	 	to	work	like	a	 fly 	 wheel 	 	.
it	 enhance 	 s 	 	peace	even	further	.
where	there	is	no	conflict	,	trade	 flourish 	 es 	 	.
and	trade	is	 an 	 other 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	incentive	against	violence	.
with	trade	,	there	's	mutual	 inter 	 depend 	 ency 	 	and	mutual	gain	between	 part 	 ies 	 	.
and	when	there	is	mutual	gain	,	both	 side 	 s 	 	stand	to	lose	more	than	they	would	gain	if	they	 start 	 ed 	 	a	war	.
war	is	 simpl 	 y 	 	no	 long 	 er 	 	the	best	option	,	and	that	is	why	violence	 ha 	 s 	 	 de 	 crease 	 d 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	,	 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	is	the	 rational 	 e 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	the	 exist 	 ence 	 	of	my	 arm 	 ed 	 	 force 	 s 	 	.
the	 arm 	 ed 	 	 force 	 s 	 	implement	the	state	 monopol 	 y 	 	on	violence	.
we	do	 th 	 is 	 	in	a	 legitimize 	 d 	 	way	 on 	 ly 	 	after	our	 demo 	 cracy 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	us	to	do	so	.
it	is	 th 	 is 	 	legitimate	,	controlled	use	of	the	gun	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 con 	 tribute 	 d 	 	 great 	 ly 	 	to	the	 statistic 	 s 	 	of	war	,	conflict	and	violence	around	the	 glob 	 e 	 	.
it	is	 th 	 is 	 	 particip 	 ation 	 	in	 peace 	 keep 	 ing 	 	 mission 	 s 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	led	to	the	 re 	 solution 	 	of	 man 	 y 	 	civil	 war 	 s 	 	.
my	 soldier 	 s 	 	use	the	gun	 a 	 s 	 	an	instrument	of	peace	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	why	 fail 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	are	so	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
 fail 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	have	no	 legitimize 	 d 	 	,	 democrat 	 ically 	 	controlled	use	of	force	.
 fail 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	do	not	know	of	the	gun	 a 	 s 	 	an	instrument	of	peace	and	 st 	 ability 	 	.
that	is	why	 fail 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	can	drag	down	a	whole	region	 in 	 to 	 	 cha 	 os 	 	and	conflict	.
that	is	why	 spread 	 ing 	 	the	 con 	 cept 	 	of	the	 constit 	 ution 	 al 	 	state	is	 s 	 uch 	 	an	 import 	 ant 	 	 a 	 spect 	 	of	our	foreign	 mission 	 s 	 	.
that	is	why	we	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	build	a	 judi 	 cial 	 	system	right	now	in	afghanistan	.
that	is	why	we	train	police	 officer 	 s 	 	,	we	train	 judg 	 es 	 	,	we	train	public	 prosecut 	 ors 	 	around	the	world	.
and	that	is	why	--	and	in	the	netherlands	,	we	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 ique 	 	in	that	--	that	is	why	the	dutch	 constit 	 ution 	 	 state 	 s 	 	that	one	of	the	main	 task 	 s 	 	of	the	 arm 	 ed 	 	 force 	 s 	 	is	to	 up 	 hold 	 	and	promote	the	 inter 	 national 	 	rule	of	law	.
 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	looking	at	 th 	 is 	 	gun	,	we	are	 confront 	 ed 	 	with	the	 ug 	 ly 	 	side	of	the	human	mind	.
every	day	i	hope	that	 politic 	 ians 	 	,	 diplomat 	 s 	 	,	 develop 	 ment 	 	 work 	 ers 	 	can	turn	conflict	 in 	 to 	 	peace	and	threat	 in 	 to 	 	hope	.
and	i	hope	that	one	day	 arm 	 ies 	 	can	be	 dis 	 band 	 ed 	 	and	 human 	 s 	 	will	find	a	way	of	living	together	 with 	 out 	 	violence	and	 oppress 	 ion 	 	.
but	 un 	 til 	 	that	day	 come 	 s 	 	,	we	will	have	to	make	 ideal 	 s 	 	and	human	failure	meet	 some 	 where 	 	in	the	middle	.
 un 	 til 	 	that	day	 come 	 s 	 	,	i	stand	for	my	father	who	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	shoot	the	nazis	with	an	old	gun	.
i	stand	for	my	men	and	women	who	are	prepared	to	risk	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	for	a	less	violent	world	for	all	of	us	.
i	stand	for	 th 	 is 	 	soldier	who	 suffer 	 ed 	 	partial	 hear 	 ing 	 	loss	and	 sustain 	 ed 	 	permanent	 inju 	 ries 	 	to	her	leg	,	which	was	hit	by	a	rocket	on	a	mission	in	afghanistan	.
 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	the	day	 come 	 s 	 	when	we	can	do	away	with	the	gun	,	i	hope	we	all	agree	that	peace	and	 st 	 ability 	 	do	not	come	free	of	charge	.
it	 take 	 s 	 	hard	work	,	often	 be 	 hind 	 	the	 scene 	 s 	 	.
it	 take 	 s 	 	good	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	and	well	-	trained	,	 dedicate 	 d 	 	 soldier 	 s 	 	.	i	hope	you	will	support	the	 effort 	 s 	 	of	our	 arm 	 ed 	 	 force 	 s 	 	to	train	 soldier 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	young	 cap 	 tain 	 	and	provide	her	with	a	good	gun	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	the	bad	gun	my	father	was	 give 	 n 	 	.
i	hope	you	will	support	our	 soldier 	 s 	 	when	they	are	out	there	,	when	they	come	home	and	when	they	are	 inju 	 red 	 	and	need	our	care	.
they	put	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	on	the	line	,	for	us	,	for	you	,	and	we	can	not	let	them	down	.
i	hope	you	will	respect	my	 soldier 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	soldier	with	 th 	 is 	 	gun	.
