there	is	 noth 	 ing 	 	 big 	 ger 	 	or	 old 	 er 	 	than	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
the	 question 	 s 	 	i	would	like	to	talk	about	are	:	one	,	where	did	we	come	from	?
how	did	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	come	 in 	 to 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	?
are	we	 al 	 one 	 	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	?
is	there	alien	life	out	there	?
what	is	the	future	of	the	human	race	?
up	 un 	 til 	 	the	1920s	,	 every 	 one 	 	thought	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	was	 essential 	 ly 	 	static	and	 un 	 changing 	 	in	time	.
then	it	was	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	was	 expand 	 ing 	 	.
 di 	 stant 	 	 galax 	 ies 	 	 we 	 re 	 	moving	away	from	us	.	 th 	 is 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	they	must	have	 be 	 en 	 	 close 	 r 	 	together	in	the	past	.
if	we	 extrapol 	 ate 	 	back	,	we	find	we	must	have	all	 be 	 en 	 	on	top	of	each	other	about	15	billion	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	the	big	bang	,	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
but	was	there	 any 	 thing 	 	before	the	big	bang	?
if	not	,	what	 create 	 d 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	?
why	did	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	emerge	from	the	big	bang	the	way	it	did	?
we	used	to	think	that	the	 theor 	 y 	 	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	could	be	 divid 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	two	 part 	 s 	 	.
first	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	the	 law 	 s 	 	like	maxwell	's	 equ 	 ations 	 	and	general	 relat 	 ivity 	 	that	 determine 	 d 	 	the	evolution	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	 give 	 n 	 	 it 	 s 	 	state	over	all	of	space	at	one	time	.
and	second	,	there	was	no	question	of	the	 initi 	 al 	 	state	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
we	have	made	good	progress	on	the	first	part	,	and	now	have	the	knowledge	of	the	 law 	 s 	 	of	evolution	in	all	but	the	most	 extrem 	 e 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	.
but	 un 	 til 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	we	have	had	little	idea	about	the	 initi 	 al 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	for	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	division	 in 	 to 	 	 law 	 s 	 	of	evolution	and	 initi 	 al 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	 depend 	 s 	 	on	time	and	space	 be 	 ing 	 	 separat 	 e 	 	and	distinct	.
under	 extrem 	 e 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	,	general	 relat 	 ivity 	 	and	 quant 	 um 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	allow	time	to	 behav 	 e 	 	like	 an 	 other 	 	dimension	of	space	.
 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 move 	 s 	 	the	 distinct 	 ion 	 	between	time	and	space	,	and	 mean 	 s 	 	the	 law 	 s 	 	of	evolution	can	 al 	 so 	 	determine	the	 initi 	 al 	 	state	.
the	 uni 	 verse 	 	can	 spontane 	 ously 	 	create	 it 	 self 	 	out	of	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
 more 	 over 	 	,	we	can	 calcul 	 ate 	 	a	 prob 	 ability 	 	that	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	was	 create 	 d 	 	in	different	 state 	 s 	 	.
these	 predict 	 ions 	 	are	in	 excel 	 lent 	 	 agree 	 ment 	 	with	 observ 	 ations 	 	by	the	wmap	satellite	of	the	 cosm 	 ic 	 	 micro 	 wave 	 	 back 	 ground 	 	,	which	is	an	 im 	 print 	 	of	the	 ver 	 y 	 	early	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
we	think	we	have	 solve 	 d 	 	the	 myster 	 y 	 	of	creation	.
 may 	 be 	 	we	should	patent	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	and	charge	 every 	 one 	 	 royal 	 ties 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 exist 	 ence 	 	.
i	now	turn	to	the	second	big	question	:
are	we	 al 	 one 	 	,	or	is	there	other	life	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	?
we	 believ 	 e 	 	that	life	 a 	 rose 	 	 spontane 	 ously 	 	on	the	earth	,	so	it	must	be	possible	for	life	to	appear	on	other	 suit 	 able 	 	 planet 	 s 	 	,	of	which	there	seem	to	be	a	large	number	in	the	 galax 	 y 	 	.
but	we	do	n't	know	how	life	first	 appear 	 ed 	 	.
we	have	two	 piece 	 s 	 	of	 observ 	 ation 	 al 	 	evidence	on	the	 prob 	 ability 	 	of	life	 appear 	 ing 	 	.
the	first	is	that	we	have	 fossil 	 s 	 	of	 al 	 ga 	 e 	 	from	3.5	billion	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
the	earth	was	 form 	 ed 	 	4.6	billion	 year 	 s 	 	ago	and	was	 prob 	 ably 	 	too	hot	for	about	the	first	half	billion	 year 	 s 	 	.
so	life	 appear 	 ed 	 	on	earth	 with 	 in 	 	half	a	billion	 year 	 s 	 	of	it	 be 	 ing 	 	possible	,	which	is	short	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	the	10	-	billion	-	year	 life 	 time 	 	of	a	planet	of	earth	type	.
 th 	 is 	 	 suggest 	 s 	 	that	a	 prob 	 ability 	 	of	life	 appear 	 ing 	 	is	 reason 	 ably 	 	high	.
if	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	low	,	one	would	have	 expect 	 ed 	 	it	to	take	most	of	the	ten	billion	 year 	 s 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	.
on	the	other	hand	,	we	do	n't	seem	to	have	 be 	 en 	 	 visit 	 ed 	 	by	 alien 	 s 	 	.
i	am	 dis 	 count 	 ing 	 	the	 report 	 s 	 	of	ufos	.
why	would	they	appear	 on 	 ly 	 	to	 crank 	 s 	 	and	 weird 	 o 	 es 	 	?
if	there	is	a	government	 conspi 	 racy 	 	to	suppress	the	 report 	 s 	 	and	keep	for	 it 	 self 	 	the	scientific	knowledge	the	 alien 	 s 	 	 br 	 ing 	 	,	it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	have	 be 	 en 	 	a	 s 	 ing 	 ular 	 ly 	 	 in 	 effective 	 	policy	so	far	.
 further 	 more 	 	,	 de 	 spite 	 	an	 extens 	 ive 	 	search	by	the	seti	project	,	we	have	n't	heard	any	alien	 tele 	 vision 	 	quiz	 show 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 prob 	 ably 	 	 indic 	 ates 	 	that	there	are	no	alien	 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	at	our	stage	of	 develop 	 ment 	 	 with 	 in 	 	a	 radi 	 us 	 	of	a	few	hundred	light	 year 	 s 	 	.
 is 	 suing 	 	an	 insur 	 ance 	 	policy	against	 abduct 	 ion 	 	by	 alien 	 s 	 	 seem 	 s 	 	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	safe	bet	.
 th 	 is 	 	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	me	to	the	last	of	the	big	 question 	 s 	 	:	the	future	of	the	human	race	.
if	we	are	the	 on 	 ly 	 	intelligent	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	in	the	 galax 	 y 	 	,	we	should	make	 s 	 ure 	 	we	 surviv 	 e 	 	and	 continu 	 e 	 	.
but	we	are	 enter 	 ing 	 	an	 increasing 	 ly 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	period	of	our	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
our	population	and	our	use	of	the	 fin 	 ite 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	of	planet	earth	are	growing	 exponential 	 ly 	 	,	 a 	 long 	 	with	our	technical	ability	to	change	the	environment	for	good	or	ill	.
but	our	genetic	code	still	 car 	 ries 	 	the	 self 	 ish 	 	and	 aggress 	 ive 	 	 instinct 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	of	 surviv 	 al 	 	advantage	in	the	past	.
it	will	be	difficult	 en 	 ough 	 	to	avoid	disaster	in	the	next	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	,	let	 al 	 one 	 	the	next	thousand	or	million	.
our	 on 	 ly 	 	chance	of	long	-	term	 surviv 	 al 	 	is	not	to	remain	 lurk 	 ing 	 	on	planet	earth	,	but	to	spread	out	 in 	 to 	 	space	.
the	 answer 	 s 	 	to	these	big	 question 	 s 	 	show	that	we	have	made	 remark 	 able 	 	progress	in	the	last	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	.
but	if	we	want	to	 continu 	 e 	 	beyond	the	next	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	,	our	future	is	in	space	.
that	is	why	i	am	in	favor	of	 mann 	 ed 	 	--	or	should	i	say	,	 person 	 ed 	 	--	space	flight	.
all	of	my	life	i	have	 s 	 ought 	 	to	understand	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	and	find	 answer 	 s 	 	to	these	 question 	 s 	 	.
i	have	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	that	my	 dis 	 ability 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 be 	 en 	 	a	serious	handicap	.	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 prob 	 ably 	 	 give 	 n 	 	me	more	time	than	most	people	to	pursue	the	quest	for	knowledge	.
the	ultimate	goal	is	a	complete	 theor 	 y 	 	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	and	we	are	making	good	progress	.
thank	you	for	 listen 	 ing 	 	.
chris	anderson	:	professor	,	if	you	had	to	guess	either	way	,	do	you	now	 believ 	 e 	 	that	it	is	more	 like 	 ly 	 	than	not	that	we	are	 al 	 one 	 	in	the	 milk 	 y 	 	way	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 civil 	 ization 	 	of	our	level	of	 intellig 	 ence 	 	or	 high 	 er 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	answer	took	seven	 minute 	 s 	 	,	and	 re 	 ally 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	me	an	 in 	 sight 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 in 	 credible 	 	act	of	 gene 	 ros 	 ity 	 	 th 	 is 	 	whole	talk	was	for	ted	.
stephen	 hawk 	 ing 	 	:	i	think	it	 quit 	 e 	 	 like 	 ly 	 	that	we	are	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 civil 	 ization 	 	 with 	 in 	 	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	hundred	light	 year 	 s 	 	;
 other 	 wise 	 	we	would	have	heard	radio	 wave 	 s 	 	.
