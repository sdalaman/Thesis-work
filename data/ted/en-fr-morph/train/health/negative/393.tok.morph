the	 fragr 	 ance 	 	that	you	will	smell	,	you	will	never	be	able	to	smell	 th 	 is 	 	way	 aga 	 in 	 	.
it	's	a	 fragr 	 ance 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	beyond	 para 	 dis 	 e 	 	,	which	you	can	find	in	any	store	in	the	nation	.
 ex 	 cept 	 	here	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	split	up	in	 part 	 s 	 	by	est√©e	lauder	and	by	the	 perfume 	 r 	 	who	did	it	,	calice	becker	,
and	i	'm	most	 grat 	 e 	 ful 	 	to	them	for	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	split	up	in	 success 	 ive 	 	bits	and	a	 chor 	 d 	 	.
so	what	you	're	 smell 	 ing 	 	now	is	the	top	note	.
and	then	will	come	what	they	call	the	heart	,	the	lush	heart	note	.
i	will	show	it	to	you	.
the	eden	top	note	is	named	after	the	eden	project	in	the	u.k	.
the	lush	heart	note	,	melaleuca	bark	note	--	which	 do 	 es 	 	not	contain	any	melaleuca	bark	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 total 	 ly 	 	 forbid 	 den 	 	.
and	after	that	,	the	complete	 fragr 	 ance 	 	.
now	what	you	are	 smell 	 ing 	 	is	a	combination	of	--
i	 ask 	 ed 	 	how	 man 	 y 	 	 molecule 	 s 	 	there	 we 	 re 	 	in	there	,	and	 no 	 body 	 	would	tell	me	.
so	i	put	it	through	a	g.c	.	,	a	gas	chromatograph	that	i	have	in	my	 off 	 ice 	 	,	and	it	's	about	400	.
so	what	you	're	 smell 	 ing 	 	is	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	hundred	 molecule 	 s 	 	 float 	 ing 	 	through	the	air	,	hitting	your	nose	.
and	do	not	get	the	impression	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 subject 	 ive 	 	.
you	are	all	 smell 	 ing 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	the	same	thing	,	ok	?
smell	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	reputation	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 some 	 what 	 	different	for	each	person	.
it	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	true	.
and	 perfume 	 ry 	 	 show 	 s 	 	you	that	ca	n't	be	true	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	it	 we 	 re 	 	like	that	it	would	n't	be	an	art	,	ok	?
now	,	while	the	smell	 waft 	 s 	 	over	you	,	let	me	tell	you	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	an	idea	.
 every 	 thing 	 	that	you	're	 smell 	 ing 	 	in	here	is	made	up	of	 atom 	 s 	 	that	come	from	what	i	call	the	upper	east	side	of	the	 period 	 ic 	 	table	--	a	nice	,	safe	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	.
you	 re 	 ally 	 	do	n't	want	to	 leav 	 e 	 	it	if	you	want	to	have	a	 care 	 er 	 	in	 perfume 	 ry 	 	.
some	people	have	 tri 	 ed 	 	in	the	1920s	to	add	 thing 	 s 	 	from	the	bad	 part 	 s 	 	,	and	it	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	work	.
these	are	the	five	 atom 	 s 	 	from	which	just	about	 every 	 thing 	 	that	you	're	going	to	smell	in	real	life	,	from	coffee	to	 fragr 	 ance 	 	,	are	made	of	.
the	top	note	that	you	 smell 	 ed 	 	at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	the	cut	-	grass	green	,	what	we	call	in	 perfume 	 ry 	 	--	they	're	weird	 term 	 s 	 	--
and	 th 	 is 	 	would	be	 call 	 ed 	 	a	green	note	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 smell 	 s 	 	of	 some 	 thing 	 	green	,	like	cut	grass	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	cis	-	3	-	hexene	-	1	-	ol	.	and	i	had	to	learn	 chemist 	 ry 	 	on	the	fly	in	the	last	three	 year 	 s 	 	.	a	 ver 	 y 	 	expensive	high	school	 chemist 	 ry 	 	education	.
 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	six	carbon	 atom 	 s 	 	,	so	``	hexa	,	``	hexene	-	1	-	ol	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	one	double	bond	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	an	alcohol	on	the	end	,	so	it	's	``	ol	,	``	and	that	's	why	they	call	it	cis	-	3	-	hexene	-	1	-	ol	.
once	you	figure	 th 	 is 	 	out	,	you	can	 re 	 ally 	 	impress	people	at	 part 	 ies 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 smell 	 s 	 	of	cut	grass	.	now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	skeleton	of	the	molecule	.
if	you	dress	it	up	with	 atom 	 s 	 	,	hydrogen	 atom 	 s 	 	--	that	's	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	when	you	have	it	on	your	computer	--	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	it	's	sort	of	more	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	in	the	sense	that	the	 atom 	 s 	 	have	a	certain	sphere	that	you	can	not	penetrate	.	they	repel	.
ok	,	now	.	why	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	thing	smell	of	cut	grass	,	ok	?
why	 do 	 es 	 	n't	it	smell	of	 potato 	 es 	 	or	 viol 	 et 	 s 	 	?	well	,	there	are	 re 	 ally 	 	two	 the 	 ories 	 	.
but	the	first	 theor 	 y 	 	is	:	it	must	be	the	shape	.
and	that	's	a	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 reason 	 able 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	in	the	sense	that	 al 	 most 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	else	in	biology	 work 	 s 	 	by	shape	.
 enzyme 	 s 	 	that	chew	 thing 	 s 	 	up	,	 anti 	 bodies 	 	,	it	's	all	,	you	know	,	the	fit	between	a	protein	and	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	 grab 	 bing 	 	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	a	smell	.
and	i	will	try	and	explain	to	you	what	's	wrong	with	 th 	 is 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	.
and	the	other	 theor 	 y 	 	is	that	we	smell	 mole 	 cular 	 	 vibration 	 s 	 	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 total 	 ly 	 	 insan 	 e 	 	idea	.
and	when	i	first	came	 a 	 cross 	 	it	in	the	early	'90s	,	i	thought	my	 pre 	 decessor 	 	,	malcolm	dyson	and	bob	wright	,	had	 re 	 ally 	 	taken	 leav 	 e 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 sense 	 s 	 	,
and	i	'll	explain	to	you	why	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	case	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	i	came	to	 real 	 ize 	 	 gradu 	 ally 	 	that	they	may	be	right	--
and	i	have	to	 con 	 vince 	 	all	my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	so	,	but	i	'm	 work 	 ing 	 	on	it	.
here	's	how	shape	 work 	 s 	 	in	normal	 receptor 	 s 	 	.
you	have	a	molecule	coming	in	,	it	 get 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	protein	,	which	is	schematic	here	,	and	it	 cause 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	thing	to	 s 	 witch 	 	,	to	turn	,	to	move	in	some	way	by	 bind 	 ing 	 	in	certain	 part 	 s 	 	.
and	the	 attract 	 ion 	 	,	the	 force 	 s 	 	,	between	the	molecule	and	the	protein	cause	the	motion	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	shape	-	based	idea	.
now	,	what	's	wrong	with	shape	is	 summarize 	 d 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	slide	.
the	way	--	i	expect	 every 	 body 	 	to	 memor 	 ize 	 	these	 com 	 pound 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	page	of	work	from	a	chemist	's	 work 	 book 	 	,	ok	?	 work 	 ing 	 	for	a	 fragr 	 ance 	 	company	.
he	's	making	45	 molecule 	 s 	 	,	and	he	's	looking	for	a	sandalwood	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 smell 	 s 	 	of	sandalwood	.	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	a	lot	of	money	in	 sandalwood 	 s 	 	.
and	of	these	45	 molecule 	 s 	 	,	 on 	 ly 	 	4629	 actual 	 ly 	 	 smell 	 s 	 	of	sandalwood	.
and	he	 put 	 s 	 	an	 ex 	 clam 	 ation 	 	mark	,	ok	?	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	awful	lot	of	work	.
 th 	 is 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	is	 rough 	 ly 	 	,	in	man	-	 year 	 s 	 	of	work	,	200,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	 rough 	 ly 	 	,	if	you	keep	them	on	the	low	 s 	 al 	 aries 	 	with	no	 benefit 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 pro 	 found 	 ly 	 	 in 	 efficient 	 	process	.
and	my	definition	of	a	 theor 	 y 	 	is	,	it	's	not	just	 some 	 thing 	 	that	you	teach	people	;	it	's	labor	saving	.
a	 theor 	 y 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 en 	 able 	 s 	 	you	to	do	less	work	.
i	love	the	idea	of	 do 	 ing 	 	less	work	.	so	let	me	explain	to	you	why	--	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	fact	that	 tell 	 s 	 	you	why	 th 	 is 	 	shape	 theor 	 y 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 do 	 es 	 	not	work	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	cis	-	3	-	hexene	-	1	-	ol	.	it	 smell 	 s 	 	of	cut	grass	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	cis	-	3	-	hexene	-	1	-	thiol	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 smell 	 s 	 	of	 rot 	 ten 	 	 egg 	 s 	 	,	ok	?
now	,	you	will	have	 notice 	 d 	 	that	vodka	never	 smell 	 s 	 	of	 rot 	 ten 	 	 egg 	 s 	 	.
if	it	 do 	 es 	 	,	you	put	the	glass	down	,	you	go	to	a	different	bar	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	--	in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	we	never	get	the	o	-	h	--	we	never	 mistak 	 e 	 	it	for	an	s	-	h	,	ok	?
like	,	at	no	 concent 	 ration 	 	,	even	 pur 	 e 	 	,	you	know	,	if	you	 s 	 melt 	 	 pur 	 e 	 	ethanol	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	smell	of	 rot 	 ten 	 	 egg 	 s 	 	.
 con 	 verse 	 ly 	 	,	there	is	no	 concent 	 ration 	 	at	which	the	sulfur	 com 	 pound 	 	will	smell	like	vodka	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	explain	 th 	 is 	 	by	 mole 	 cular 	 	 re 	 cognition 	 	.
now	,	i	 show 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	to	a	physicist	friend	of	mine	who	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 pro 	 found 	 	 dis 	 taste 	 	for	biology	,	and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	that	's	easy	!	the	 thing 	 s 	 	are	a	different	color	!	``
we	have	to	go	a	little	beyond	that	.	now	let	me	explain	why	 vibration 	 al 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	some	sort	of	interest	in	it	.	these	 molecule 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	saw	in	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	the	building	 block 	 s 	 	had	 spring 	 s 	 	 connect 	 ing 	 	them	to	each	other	.
in	fact	,	 molecule 	 s 	 	are	able	to	 vib 	 rate 	 	at	a	set	of	 fr 	 equ 	 encies 	 	which	are	 ver 	 y 	 	specific	for	each	molecule	and	for	the	 bond 	 s 	 	 connect 	 ing 	 	them	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	sound	of	the	o	-	h	stretch	,	 transl 	 ated 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	audible	range	.
s	-	h	,	 quit 	 e 	 	a	different	frequency	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	kind	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 tell 	 s 	 	you	that	you	should	be	looking	for	a	 part 	 icular 	 	fact	,	which	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	 noth 	 ing 	 	in	the	world	 smell 	 s 	 	like	 rot 	 ten 	 	 egg 	 s 	 	 ex 	 cept 	 	s	-	h	,	ok	?
now	,	fact	b	:	 noth 	 ing 	 	in	the	world	 ha 	 s 	 	that	frequency	 ex 	 cept 	 	s	-	h	.
if	you	look	on	 th 	 is 	 	,	imagine	a	piano	 key 	 board 	 	.
the	s	-	h	stretch	is	in	the	middle	of	a	part	of	the	 key 	 board 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	,	so	to	speak	,	 damage 	 d 	 	,	and	there	are	no	 neighbor 	 ing 	 	 note 	 s 	 	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	is	close	to	it	.
you	have	a	 un 	 ique 	 	smell	,	a	 un 	 ique 	 	vibration	.
so	i	went	 search 	 ing 	 	when	i	 start 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	game	to	 con 	 vince 	 	 my 	 self 	 	that	there	was	any	degree	of	 pla 	 us 	 ibility 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	whole	crazy	story	.
i	went	 search 	 ing 	 	for	a	type	of	molecule	,	any	molecule	,	that	would	have	that	vibration	and	that	--	the	obvious	 predict 	 ion 	 	was	that	it	should	 absolute 	 ly 	 	smell	of	sulfur	.
if	it	did	n't	,	the	whole	idea	was	toast	,	and	i	might	 a 	 s 	 	well	move	on	to	other	 thing 	 s 	 	.
now	,	after	 search 	 ing 	 	high	and	low	for	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 month 	 s 	 	,	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	there	was	a	type	of	molecule	 call 	 ed 	 	a	borane	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	vibration	.
now	the	good	news	is	,	boranes	you	can	get	hold	of	.
the	bad	news	is	they	're	rocket	 fuel 	 s 	 	.
most	of	them	explode	 spontane 	 ously 	 	in	contact	with	air	,
and	when	you	call	up	the	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	,	they	 on 	 ly 	 	give	you	 minim 	 um 	 	ten	 ton 	 s 	 	,	ok	?
so	 th 	 is 	 	was	not	what	they	call	a	 labor 	 atory 	 	-	scale	experiment	,	and	they	would	n't	have	 like 	 d 	 	it	at	my	college	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	i	 manage 	 d 	 	to	get	a	hold	of	a	borane	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	and	here	is	the	beast	.
and	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 do 	 es 	 	have	the	same	--	if	you	 calcul 	 ate 	 	,	if	you	measure	the	 vibration 	 al 	 	 fr 	 equ 	 encies 	 	,	they	are	the	same	 a 	 s 	 	s	-	h	.
now	,	 do 	 es 	 	it	smell	of	sulfur	?	well	,	if	you	go	back	in	the	 liter 	 ature 	 	,	there	's	a	man	who	 k 	 new 	 	more	about	boranes	than	 any 	 one 	 	 al 	 ive 	 	then	or	since	,	alfred	stock	,	he	 synthesize 	 d 	 	all	of	them	.
and	in	an	enormous	40	-	page	paper	in	german	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	at	one	point	--	my	wife	is	german	and	she	 transl 	 ated 	 	it	for	me	--	and	at	one	point	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 gan 	 z 	 	 wide 	 r 	 lich 	 	geruch	,	``	an	``	 absolute 	 ly 	 	repulsive	smell	,	``	which	is	good	.	 re 	 mini 	 s 	 cent 	 	of	hydrogen	sulfide	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	fact	that	boranes	smell	of	sulfur	had	 be 	 en 	 	known	since	1910	,	and	 utter 	 ly 	 	 for 	 gotten 	 	 un 	 til 	 	1997	,	1998	.
now	,	the	 s 	 light 	 	fly	in	the	 oint 	 ment 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	that	if	we	smell	 mole 	 cular 	 	 vibration 	 s 	 	,	we	must	have	a	 spectro 	 scope 	 	in	our	nose	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 spectro 	 scope 	 	,	ok	,	on	my	 labor 	 atory 	 	bench	.
and	it	's	fair	to	say	that	if	you	look	up	 some 	 body 	 	's	nose	,	you	're	 un 	 like 	 ly 	 	to	see	 any 	 thing 	 	 re 	 s 	 em 	 bling 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	main	 object 	 ion 	 	to	the	 theor 	 y 	 	.
ok	,	great	,	we	smell	 vibration 	 s 	 	.	how	?	all	right	?
now	when	people	ask	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	question	,	they	neglect	 some 	 thing 	 	,	which	is	that	 physicist 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	clever	,	 un 	 like 	 	 biologist 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	joke	.	i	'm	a	biologist	,	ok	?
so	it	's	a	joke	against	 my 	 self 	 	.
bob	jacklovich	and	john	lamb	at	ford	motor	company	,	in	the	 day 	 s 	 	when	ford	motor	was	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	vast	 amount 	 s 	 	of	money	on	fundamental	research	,	 discover 	 ed 	 	a	way	to	build	a	 spectro 	 scope 	 	that	was	 intrinsic 	 ally 	 	nano	-	scale	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	no	 mirror 	 s 	 	,	no	 laser 	 s 	 	,	no	 prism 	 s 	 	,	no	 non 	 sense 	 	,	just	a	 tin 	 y 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	,	and	he	built	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	uses	electron	 tunnel 	 ing 	 	.
now	,	i	could	do	the	dance	of	electron	 tunnel 	 ing 	 	,	but	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	a	video	 in 	 stead 	 	,	which	is	much	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	.	here	's	how	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
 electron 	 s 	 	are	 fuzz 	 y 	 	 creature 	 s 	 	,	and	they	can	jump	 a 	 cross 	 	 gap 	 s 	 	,	but	 on 	 ly 	 	at	equal	energy	.	if	the	energy	 differ 	 s 	 	,	they	ca	n't	jump	.
 un 	 like 	 	us	,	they	wo	n't	fall	off	the	cliff	.
ok	.	now	.	if	 some 	 thing 	 	 absorb 	 s 	 	the	energy	,	the	electron	can	travel	.
so	here	you	have	a	system	,	you	have	 some 	 thing 	 	--	and	there	's	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	that	stuff	in	biology	--	some	 sub 	 stance 	 	giving	an	electron	,	and	the	electron	tries	to	jump	,	and	 on 	 ly 	 	when	a	molecule	 come 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	the	right	vibration	 do 	 es 	 	the	 re 	 action 	 	happen	,	ok	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 bas 	 is 	 	for	the	 de 	 vice 	 	that	these	two	 guy 	 s 	 	at	ford	built	.
and	every	single	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	 mechan 	 ism 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	plausible	in	biology	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	i	've	taken	off	-	the	-	shelf	 component 	 s 	 	,	and	i	've	made	a	 spectro 	 scope 	 	.
what	's	nice	about	 th 	 is 	 	idea	,	if	you	have	a	 philosoph 	 ical 	 	bent	of	mind	,	is	that	then	it	 tell 	 s 	 	you	that	the	nose	,	the	ear	and	the	eye	are	all	 vibration 	 al 	 	 sense 	 s 	 	.
of	course	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	could	 al 	 so 	 	be	that	they	're	not	.
but	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	certain	--
--	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	certain	ring	to	it	which	is	 attract 	 ive 	 	to	people	who	read	too	much	19th	-	century	german	 liter 	 ature 	 	.
and	then	a	 magnific 	 ent 	 	thing	 happen 	 ed 	 	:
i	left	academia	and	 join 	 ed 	 	the	real	world	of	business	,
and	a	company	was	 create 	 d 	 	around	my	 idea 	 s 	 	to	make	new	 molecule 	 s 	 	using	my	method	,	 a 	 long 	 	the	lines	of	,	let	's	put	 some 	 one 	 	else	's	money	where	your	mouth	is	.
and	one	of	the	first	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	was	we	 start 	 ed 	 	going	around	to	 fragr 	 ance 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	for	what	they	 need 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	of	course	,	if	you	could	 calcul 	 ate 	 	smell	,	you	do	n't	need	 chemist 	 s 	 	.
you	need	a	computer	,	a	mac	will	do	it	,	if	you	know	how	to	program	the	thing	right	,
ok	?	so	you	can	try	a	thousand	 molecule 	 s 	 	,
you	can	try	ten	thousand	 molecule 	 s 	 	in	a	 week 	 end 	 	,
and	then	you	 on 	 ly 	 	tell	the	 chemist 	 s 	 	to	make	the	right	one	.
and	so	that	's	a	direct	path	to	making	new	 odor 	 ants 	 	.
and	one	of	the	first	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	was	we	went	to	see	some	 perfume 	 rs 	 	in	france	--
and	here	's	where	i	do	my	charles	fleischer	impression	--	and	one	of	them	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	you	can	not	make	a	 cou 	 marin 	 	.	``
he	 say 	 s 	 	to	me	,	``	i	bet	you	can	not	make	a	 cou 	 marin 	 	.	``
now	,	 cou 	 marin 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	common	thing	,	a	material	,	in	 fragr 	 ance 	 	which	is	derived	from	a	bean	that	 come 	 s 	 	from	south	america	.
and	it	is	the	classic	synthetic	aroma	chemical	,	ok	?
it	's	the	molecule	that	 ha 	 s 	 	made	men	's	 fragr 	 ance 	 s 	 	smell	the	way	they	do	since	1881	,	to	be	exact	.
and	the	problem	is	it	's	a	carcinogen	.
so	 no 	 body 	 	 like 	 s 	 	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	to	--	you	know	,	 after 	 s 	 have 	 	with	 carcinogen 	 s 	 	.
there	are	some	reckless	people	,	but	it	's	not	worth	it	,	ok	?
so	they	 ask 	 ed 	 	us	to	make	a	new	 cou 	 marin 	 	.	and	so	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 calcul 	 ations 	 	.
and	the	first	thing	you	do	is	you	 calcul 	 ate 	 	the	 vibration 	 al 	 	spectrum	of	 cou 	 marin 	 	,	and	you	smooth	it	out	,
so	that	you	have	a	nice	picture	of	what	the	sort	of	 chor 	 d 	 	,	so	to	speak	,	of	 cou 	 marin 	 	is	.
and	then	you	start	 crank 	 ing 	 	the	computer	to	find	other	 molecule 	 s 	 	,	related	or	 un 	 related 	 	,	that	have	the	same	 vibration 	 s 	 	.
and	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	i	'm	sorry	to	say	,	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	--	it	was	serendipitous	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	got	a	phone	call	from	our	chief	chemist	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	look	,	i	've	just	found	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 re 	 action 	 	,	that	even	if	 th 	 is 	 	 com 	 pound 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	smell	of	 cou 	 marin 	 	,	i	want	to	do	it	,	it	's	just	 s 	 uch 	 	a	nifty	,
one	step	--	i	mean	,	 chemist 	 s 	 	have	weird	 mind 	 s 	 	--
one	step	,	90	percent	yield	,	you	know	,	and	you	get	 th 	 is 	 	 love 	 ly 	 	 crystall 	 ine 	 	 com 	 pound 	 	.	let	us	try	it	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	first	of	all	,	let	me	do	the	 calcul 	 ation 	 	on	that	 com 	 pound 	 	,	bottom	right	,	which	is	related	to	 cou 	 marin 	 	,	but	 ha 	 s 	 	an	extra	 pent 	 agon 	 	 insert 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	molecule	.
 calcul 	 ate 	 	the	 vibration 	 s 	 	,	the	 pur 	 ple 	 	spectrum	is	that	new	fellow	,	the	white	one	is	the	old	one	.
and	the	 predict 	 ion 	 	is	it	should	smell	of	 cou 	 marin 	 	.
they	made	it	...	and	it	 smell 	 ed 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	like	 cou 	 marin 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	our	new	baby	,	 call 	 ed 	 	 ton 	 ken 	 e 	 	.
you	see	,	when	you	're	a	scientist	,	you	're	 al 	 ways 	 	selling	 idea 	 s 	 	.
and	people	are	 ver 	 y 	 	resistant	to	 idea 	 s 	 	,	and	 right 	 ly 	 	so	.	why	should	new	 idea 	 s 	 	be	 accept 	 ed 	 	?
but	when	you	put	a	little	10	-	gram	vial	on	the	table	in	front	of	 perfume 	 rs 	 	and	it	 smell 	 s 	 	like	 cou 	 marin 	 	,	and	it	is	n't	 cou 	 marin 	 	,	and	you	've	found	it	in	three	 week 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 focus 	 es 	 	 every 	 body 	 	's	mind	 wonder 	 fully 	 	.
and	people	often	ask	me	,	is	your	 theor 	 y 	 	 accept 	 ed 	 	?
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	well	,	by	whom	?	i	mean	most	,	you	know	--	there	's	three	 attitude 	 s 	 	:	you	're	right	,	and	i	do	n't	know	why	,	which	is	the	most	rational	one	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	.
you	're	right	,	and	i	do	n't	care	how	you	do	it	,	in	a	sense	;	you	 br 	 ing 	 	me	the	 molecule 	 s 	 	,	you	know	.
and	:	you	're	 complete 	 ly 	 	wrong	,	and	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	you	're	 complete 	 ly 	 	wrong	.
ok	?	now	,	we	're	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	people	who	 on 	 ly 	 	want	 result 	 s 	 	,
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	commercial	world	.
and	they	tell	us	that	even	if	we	do	it	by	 astro 	 logy 	 	,	they	're	happy	.
but	we	're	not	 actual 	 ly 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	it	by	 astro 	 logy 	 	.
but	for	the	last	three	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	've	had	what	i	consider	to	be	the	best	job	in	the	entire	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	which	is	to	put	my	hobby	--	which	is	,	you	know	,	 fragr 	 ance 	 	and	all	the	 magnific 	 ent 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	--	plus	a	little	bit	of	 bio 	 physics 	 	,	a	small	amount	of	self	-	taught	 chemist 	 ry 	 	at	the	service	of	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 work 	 s 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
