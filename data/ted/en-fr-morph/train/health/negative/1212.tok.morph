so	,	i	was	in	the	hospital	for	a	long	time	.
and	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	after	i	left	,	i	went	back	,	and	the	 chair 	 man 	 	of	the	burn	 depart 	 ment 	 	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	to	see	me	--
 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	dan	,	i	have	a	fantastic	new	 treat 	 ment 	 	for	you	.	``
i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	.	i	 walk 	 ed 	 	with	him	to	his	 off 	 ice 	 	.
and	he	 explain 	 ed 	 	to	me	that	,	when	i	 s 	 have 	 	,	i	have	little	black	 dot 	 s 	 	on	the	left	side	of	my	face	where	the	hair	is	,	but	on	the	right	side	of	my	face	i	was	 bad 	 ly 	 	 burn 	 ed 	 	so	i	have	no	hair	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 create 	 s 	 	lack	of	symmetry	.
and	what	's	the	 brilli 	 ant 	 	idea	he	had	?
he	was	going	to	tattoo	little	black	 dot 	 s 	 	on	the	right	side	of	my	face	and	make	me	look	 ver 	 y 	 	symmetric	.
it	 sound 	 ed 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.	he	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	to	go	and	 s 	 have 	 	.
let	me	tell	you	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	strange	way	to	 s 	 have 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	thought	about	it	and	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	the	way	i	was	 s 	 hav 	 ing 	 	then	would	be	the	way	i	would	 s 	 have 	 	for	the	rest	of	my	life	--	 be 	 cause 	 	i	had	to	keep	the	width	the	same	.
when	i	got	back	to	his	 off 	 ice 	 	,	i	was	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	can	i	see	some	evidence	for	 th 	 is 	 	?	``
so	he	 show 	 ed 	 	me	some	 picture 	 s 	 	of	little	 cheek 	 s 	 	with	little	black	 dot 	 s 	 	--	not	 ver 	 y 	 	 inform 	 ative 	 	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	i	grow	 old 	 er 	 	and	my	hair	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	white	?
what	would	happen	then	?	``
``	oh	,	do	n't	worry	about	it	,	``	he	 s 	 aid 	 	.
``	we	have	 laser 	 s 	 	;	we	can	 white 	 n 	 	it	out	.	``
but	i	was	still	 concern 	 ed 	 	,	so	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	what	,	i	'm	not	going	to	do	it	.	``
and	then	came	one	of	the	 big 	 gest 	 	guilt	 trip 	 s 	 	of	my	life	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	coming	from	a	jewish	guy	,	all	right	,	so	that	 mean 	 s 	 	a	lot	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	dan	,	what	's	wrong	with	you	?
do	you	enjoy	looking	non	-	symmetric	?
do	you	have	some	kind	of	 per 	 vert 	 ed 	 	pleasure	from	 th 	 is 	 	?
do	women	feel	 p 	 ity 	 	for	you	and	have	 s 	 ex 	 	with	you	more	 frequent 	 ly 	 	?	``
 non 	 e 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	 ver 	 y 	 	surprising	to	me	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	've	gone	through	 man 	 y 	 	 treat 	 ments 	 	--	there	 we 	 re 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 treat 	 ments 	 	i	 decide 	 d 	 	not	to	do	--	and	i	never	got	 th 	 is 	 	guilt	trip	to	 th 	 is 	 	 ex 	 tent 	 	.
but	i	 decide 	 d 	 	not	to	have	 th 	 is 	 	 treat 	 ment 	 	.
and	i	went	to	his	 de 	 put 	 y 	 	and	 ask 	 ed 	 	him	,	``	what	was	going	on	?
where	was	 th 	 is 	 	guilt	trip	coming	from	?	``
and	he	 explain 	 ed 	 	that	they	have	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	procedure	on	two	 patient 	 s 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	,	and	they	need	the	third	patient	for	a	paper	they	 we 	 re 	 	writing	.
now	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	think	that	 th 	 is 	 	guy	's	a	 sch 	 muck 	 	.
right	,	that	's	what	he	 seem 	 s 	 	like	.
but	let	me	give	you	a	different	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	on	the	same	story	.
a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	was	running	some	of	my	own	 experiment 	 s 	 	in	the	lab	.
and	when	we	run	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	we	 usual 	 ly 	 	hope	that	one	group	will	 behav 	 e 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	than	 an 	 other 	 	.
so	we	had	one	group	that	i	 hop 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	performance	would	be	 ver 	 y 	 	high	,	 an 	 other 	 	group	that	i	thought	 the 	 ir 	 	performance	would	be	 ver 	 y 	 	low	,
and	when	i	got	the	 result 	 s 	 	,	that	's	what	we	got	--	i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	--	 a 	 side 	 	from	one	person	.
there	was	one	person	in	the	group	that	was	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	have	 ver 	 y 	 	high	performance	that	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 perform 	 ing 	 	 terr 	 ibly 	 	.
and	he	 pull 	 ed 	 	the	whole	mean	down	,	 destroy 	 ing 	 	my	 statistic 	 al 	 	 sign 	 ific 	 ance 	 	of	the	test	.
so	i	 look 	 ed 	 	 care 	 fully 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	guy	.
he	was	20	-	some	 year 	 s 	 	 old 	 er 	 	than	 any 	 body 	 	else	in	the	 s 	 ample 	 	.
and	i	 remember 	 ed 	 	that	the	old	and	 drunk 	 en 	 	guy	came	one	day	to	the	lab	 want 	 ing 	 	to	make	some	easy	cash	and	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	guy	.
``	fantastic	!	``	i	thought	.	``	let	's	throw	him	out	.
who	would	ever	include	a	 drunk 	 en 	 	guy	in	a	 s 	 ample 	 	?	``
but	a	couple	of	 day 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	we	thought	about	it	with	my	 student 	 s 	 	,	and	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	would	have	 happen 	 ed 	 	if	 th 	 is 	 	 drunk 	 en 	 	guy	was	not	in	that	condition	?
what	would	have	 happen 	 ed 	 	if	he	was	in	the	other	group	?
would	we	have	 throw 	 n 	 	him	out	then	?	``
we	 prob 	 ably 	 	would	n't	have	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	data	at	all	,	and	if	we	did	look	at	the	data	,	we	'd	 prob 	 ably 	 	have	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	fantastic	!	what	a	smart	guy	who	is	 perform 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	low	,	``	 be 	 cause 	 	he	would	have	 pull 	 ed 	 	the	mean	of	the	group	lower	,	giving	us	even	 strong 	 er 	 	 statistic 	 al 	 	 result 	 s 	 	than	we	could	.
so	we	 decide 	 d 	 	not	to	throw	the	guy	out	and	to	 re 	 run 	 	the	experiment	.
but	you	know	,	these	 st 	 ories 	 	,	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	other	 experiment 	 s 	 	that	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	on	 conflict 	 s 	 	of	interest	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	kind	of	 br 	 ing 	 	two	 point 	 s 	 	to	the	 fore 	 ground 	 	for	me	.
the	first	one	is	that	in	life	we	 en 	 counter 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	who	,	in	some	way	or	 an 	 other 	 	,	try	to	tattoo	our	 face 	 s 	 	.
they	just	have	the	 incentive 	 s 	 	that	get	them	to	be	 blind 	 ed 	 	to	 re 	 ality 	 	and	give	us	 ad 	 vice 	 	that	is	 inherent 	 ly 	 	 bias 	 ed 	 	.
and	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	that	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	all	 recogn 	 ize 	 	,	and	we	see	that	it	 happen 	 s 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	we	do	n't	 recogn 	 ize 	 	it	every	time	,	but	we	understand	that	it	 happen 	 s 	 	.
the	most	difficult	thing	,	of	course	,	is	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	that	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	we	too	are	 blind 	 ed 	 	by	our	own	 incentive 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	a	much	,	much	more	difficult	 less 	 on 	 	to	take	 in 	 to 	 	account	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	do	n't	see	how	 conflict 	 s 	 	of	interest	work	on	us	.
when	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	these	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	in	my	mind	,	i	was	 help 	 ing 	 	science	.
i	was	 elimi 	 nating 	 	the	data	to	get	the	true	pattern	of	the	data	to	shine	through	.
i	was	n't	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	bad	.
in	my	mind	,	i	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 k 	 night 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	help	science	move	 a 	 long 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	was	not	the	case	.
i	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 inter 	 fer 	 ing 	 	with	the	process	with	 lot 	 s 	 	of	good	 intent 	 ions 	 	.
and	i	think	the	real	 challeng 	 e 	 	is	to	figure	out	where	are	the	 case 	 s 	 	in	our	 live 	 s 	 	where	 conflict 	 s 	 	of	interest	work	on	us	,	and	try	not	to	trust	our	own	 intuit 	 ion 	 	to	 over 	 come 	 	it	,	but	to	try	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	that	prevent	us	from	 fall 	 ing 	 	 pre 	 y 	 	to	these	 behavior 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	can	create	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 un 	 desir 	 able 	 	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	.
i	do	want	to	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	one	positive	thought	.
i	mean	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	 ver 	 y 	 	 depress 	 ing 	 	,	right	--	people	have	 conflict 	 s 	 	of	interest	,	we	do	n't	see	it	,	and	so	on	.
the	positive	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	i	think	,	of	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	,	if	we	do	understand	when	we	go	wrong	,	if	we	understand	the	deep	 mechan 	 ism 	 s 	 	of	why	we	fail	and	where	we	fail	,	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	hope	to	fix	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	that	,	i	think	,	is	the	hope	.	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
