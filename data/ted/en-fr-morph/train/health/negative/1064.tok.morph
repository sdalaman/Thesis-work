i	am	passionate	about	the	american	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	and	how	the	physical	form	of	the	land	,	from	the	great	central	 val 	 ley 	 	of	california	to	the	 bed 	 rock 	 	of	manhattan	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	shaped	our	 histo 	 ry 	 	and	our	character	.
but	one	thing	is	clear	.
in	the	last	100	 year 	 s 	 	 al 	 one 	 	,	our	country	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	sprawl	map	of	america	--	our	country	 ha 	 s 	 	 system 	 at 	 ically 	 	 flatten 	 ed 	 	and	 homogen 	 ized 	 	the	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	to	the	point	where	we	've	 for 	 gotten 	 	our	relationship	with	the	 plant 	 s 	 	and	 animal 	 s 	 	that	live	 a 	 long 	 side 	 	us	and	the	dirt	 be 	 neath 	 	our	feet	.
and	so	,	how	i	see	my	work	 con 	 trib 	 uting 	 	is	sort	of	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 liter 	 ally 	 	re	-	imagine	these	 connect 	 ions 	 	and	 physical 	 ly 	 	 re 	 build 	 	them	.
 th 	 is 	 	graph	 represent 	 s 	 	what	we	're	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	now	in	the	built	environment	.
and	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	a	 con 	 flux 	 	of	urban	population	 ris 	 ing 	 	,	 bio 	 divers 	 ity 	 	 plummet 	 ing 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	,	of	course	,	sea	 level 	 s 	 	 ris 	 ing 	 	and	climate	changing	.
so	when	i	 al 	 so 	 	think	about	design	,	i	think	about	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 re 	 work 	 	and	re	-	engage	the	lines	on	 th 	 is 	 	graph	in	a	more	productive	way	.
and	you	can	see	from	the	arrow	here	 indic 	 ating 	 	``	you	are	here	,	``	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	sort	of	blend	and	meld	these	two	 ver 	 y 	 	 diverge 	 nt 	 	 field 	 s 	 	of	 urban 	 ism 	 	and	 eco 	 logy 	 	,	and	sort	of	 br 	 ing 	 	them	together	in	an	 excit 	 ing 	 	new	way	.
so	the	era	of	big	 infra 	 structure 	 	is	over	.
i	mean	,	these	sort	of	top	-	down	,	mono	-	functional	,	capital	-	intensive	 solution 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	not	going	to	cut	it	.
we	need	new	 tool 	 s 	 	and	new	 approach 	 es 	 	.
 similar 	 ly 	 	,	the	idea	of	 architect 	 ure 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	object	in	the	field	,	 de 	 void 	 	of	 con 	 text 	 	,	is	 re 	 ally 	 	not	the	--	excuse	me	,	it	's	 fair 	 ly 	 	blatant	--	is	 re 	 ally 	 	not	the	approach	that	we	need	to	take	.
so	we	need	new	 st 	 ories 	 	,	new	heroes	and	new	 tool 	 s 	 	.
so	now	i	want	to	 introduc 	 e 	 	you	to	my	new	hero	in	the	global	climate	change	war	,	and	that	is	the	eastern	oyster	.
so	,	albeit	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	creature	and	 ver 	 y 	 	modest	,	 th 	 is 	 	creature	is	 in 	 credible 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	can	 agglome 	 rate 	 	 in 	 to 	 	these	mega	-	reef	 structure 	 s 	 	.	it	can	grow	;	you	can	grow	it	;	and	--	did	i	 ment 	 ion 	 	?	--	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	tasty	.
so	the	oyster	was	the	 bas 	 is 	 	for	a	 manifest 	 o 	 	-	like	urban	design	project	that	i	did	about	the	new	york	harbor	 call 	 ed 	 	``	oyster	-	tecture	.	``
and	the	core	idea	of	oyster	-	tecture	is	to	harness	the	 bio 	 logical 	 	power	of	 mussel 	 s 	 	,	 eel 	 grass 	 	and	 oyster 	 s 	 	--	species	that	live	in	the	harbor	--	and	,	at	the	same	time	,	harness	the	power	of	people	who	live	in	the	community	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	making	change	now	.
here	's	a	map	of	my	city	,	new	york	city	,	 show 	 ing 	 	 in 	 un 	 d 	 ation 	 	in	red	.
and	what	's	 circle 	 d 	 	is	the	 s 	 ite 	 	that	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	,	the	gowanus	 can 	 al 	 	and	 govern 	 ors 	 	 is 	 land 	 	.
if	you	look	here	at	 th 	 is 	 	map	,	 show 	 ing 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	in	blue	is	out	in	the	water	,	and	 every 	 thing 	 	in	yellow	is	 up 	 land 	 	.
but	you	can	see	,	even	just	intuit	,	from	 th 	 is 	 	map	,	that	the	harbor	 ha 	 s 	 	 dredg 	 ed 	 	and	 flatten 	 ed 	 	,	and	went	from	a	rich	,	three	-	dimensional	mosaic	to	flat	muck	in	 re 	 ally 	 	a	matter	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	set	of	 view 	 s 	 	of	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	gowanus	 can 	 al 	 	 it 	 self 	 	.
now	the	gowanus	is	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 smell 	 y 	 	--	i	will	admit	it	.
there	are	 problem 	 s 	 	of	 sew 	 age 	 	 over 	 flow 	 	and	 contami 	 nation 	 	,	but	i	would	 al 	 so 	 	 argu 	 e 	 	that	 al 	 most 	 	every	city	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	exact	condition	,	and	it	's	a	condition	that	we	're	all	facing	.
and	here	's	a	map	of	that	condition	,	 show 	 ing 	 	the	 contami 	 nant 	 s 	 	in	yellow	and	green	,	 exacerbate 	 d 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	new	flow	of	storm	-	 s 	 urge 	 	and	sea	-	level	rise	.
so	we	 re 	 ally 	 	had	a	lot	to	deal	with	.
when	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	project	,	one	of	the	core	 idea 	 s 	 	was	to	look	back	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	and	try	to	understand	what	was	there	.
and	you	can	see	from	 th 	 is 	 	map	,	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	 geo 	 graphical 	 	signature	of	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	out	in	the	harbor	and	a	 m 	 atrix 	 	of	salt	 marsh 	 es 	 	and	 beach 	 es 	 	that	 serv 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	natural	wave	 attenu 	 ation 	 	for	the	 up 	 land 	 	 settle 	 ment 	 	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	time	that	you	could	eat	an	oyster	about	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	 d 	 inner 	 	plate	in	the	gowanus	 can 	 al 	 	 it 	 self 	 	.
so	our	 con 	 cept 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 th 	 is 	 	back	-	to	-	the	-	future	 con 	 cept 	 	,	 harness 	 ing 	 	the	 intellig 	 ence 	 	of	that	land	 settle 	 ment 	 	pattern	.
and	the	idea	 ha 	 s 	 	two	core	 stage 	 s 	 	.
one	is	to	develop	a	new	artificial	 eco 	 logy 	 	,	a	reef	out	in	the	harbor	,	that	would	then	protect	new	 settle 	 ment 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	 in 	 land 	 	and	the	gowanus	.
 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	have	 clean 	 er 	 	water	and	 s 	 lower 	 	water	,	you	can	imagine	a	new	way	of	living	with	that	water	.
so	the	project	 re 	 ally 	 	 address 	 es 	 	these	three	core	 issue 	 s 	 	in	a	new	and	 excit 	 ing 	 	way	,	i	think	.
here	we	are	,	back	to	our	hero	,	the	oyster	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	it	's	 th 	 is 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	animal	.
it	 accept 	 s 	 	 al 	 ga 	 e 	 	and	 detri 	 tu 	 s 	 	in	one	end	,	and	through	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	 glamor 	 ous 	 	set	of	stomach	 organ 	 s 	 	,	out	the	other	end	 come 	 s 	 	 clean 	 er 	 	water	.
and	one	oyster	can	filter	up	to	50	 gallon 	 s 	 	of	water	a	day	.
oyster	 reef 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 cover 	 ed 	 	about	a	quarter	of	our	harbor	and	 we 	 re 	 	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 filter 	 ing 	 	water	in	the	harbor	in	a	matter	of	 day 	 s 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	key	in	our	culture	and	our	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	,	new	york	was	built	on	the	 back 	 s 	 	of	 oyster 	 men 	 	,	and	our	 street 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	built	over	oyster	 shell 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	image	is	an	image	of	an	oyster	cart	,	which	is	now	 a 	 s 	 	 ubiqu 	 it 	 ous 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 hot 	 dog 	 	cart	is	 to 	 day 	 	.
so	 aga 	 in 	 	,	we	got	the	short	end	of	the	deal	there	.
 final 	 ly 	 	,	 oyster 	 s 	 	can	 attenu 	 ate 	 	and	 agglome 	 rate 	 	onto	each	other	and	form	these	 amaz 	 ing 	 	natural	reef	 structure 	 s 	 	.
they	 re 	 ally 	 	 be 	 come 	 	nature	's	wave	 attenu 	 ators 	 	.
and	they	 be 	 come 	 	the	 bed 	 rock 	 	of	any	harbor	 eco 	 system 	 	.
 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	species	depend	on	them	.
so	we	 we 	 re 	 	inspired	by	the	oyster	,	but	i	was	 al 	 so 	 	inspired	by	the	life	cycle	of	the	oyster	.
it	can	move	from	a	 fertil 	 ized 	 	egg	to	a	 s 	 pat 	 	,	which	is	when	they	're	 float 	 ing 	 	through	the	water	,	and	when	they	're	ready	to	attach	onto	 an 	 other 	 	oyster	,	to	an	adult	male	oyster	or	female	oyster	,	in	a	number	of	 week 	 s 	 	.
we	 re 	 interpret 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	life	cycle	on	the	scale	of	our	sight	and	took	the	gowanus	 a 	 s 	 	a	giant	oyster	 nurse 	 ry 	 	where	 oyster 	 s 	 	would	be	grown	up	in	the	gowanus	,	then	 para 	 d 	 ed 	 	down	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 s 	 pat 	 	stage	and	 seed 	 ed 	 	out	on	the	bayridge	reef	.
and	so	the	core	idea	here	was	to	hit	the	 re 	 set 	 	button	and	 re 	 generate 	 	an	 eco 	 logy 	 	over	time	that	was	 re 	 generative 	 	and	 clean 	 ing 	 	and	productive	.
how	 do 	 es 	 	the	reef	work	?	well	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	.
a	core	 con 	 cept 	 	here	is	that	climate	change	is	n't	 some 	 thing 	 	that	--	the	 answer 	 s 	 	wo	n't	land	down	from	the	moon	.
and	with	a	$	20	billion	price	tag	,	we	should	 simpl 	 y 	 	start	and	get	to	work	with	what	we	have	now	and	what	's	in	front	of	us	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	image	is	 simpl 	 y 	 	 show 	 ing 	 	--	it	's	a	field	of	marine	 pile 	 s 	 	 interconnect 	 ed 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	 wove 	 n 	 	 fuzz 	 y 	 	rope	.
what	is	 fuzz 	 y 	 	rope	,	you	ask	?
it	's	just	that	;	it	's	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 in 	 expensive 	 	thing	,	 avail 	 able 	 	 practical 	 ly 	 	at	your	 hard 	 ware 	 	store	,	and	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	cheap	.
so	we	imagine	that	we	would	 actual 	 ly 	 	 potential 	 ly 	 	even	host	a	bake	sale	to	start	our	new	project	.
so	in	the	studio	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 draw 	 ing 	 	,	we	 beg 	 an 	 	to	learn	how	to	knit	.
the	 con 	 cept 	 	was	to	 re 	 ally 	 	knit	 th 	 is 	 	rope	together	and	develop	 th 	 is 	 	new	soft	 infra 	 structure 	 	for	the	 oyster 	 s 	 	to	grow	on	.
you	can	see	in	the	 dia 	 gram 	 	how	it	 grow 	 s 	 	over	time	from	an	 infra 	 structural 	 	space	 in 	 to 	 	a	new	public	urban	space	.
and	that	 grow 	 s 	 	over	time	 dynamic 	 ally 	 	with	the	threat	of	climate	change	.
it	 al 	 so 	 	 create 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	i	think	,	new	 amphi 	 bio 	 us 	 	public	space	,	where	you	can	imagine	 work 	 ing 	 	,	you	can	imagine	 re 	 creating 	 	in	a	new	way	.
in	the	end	,	what	we	 real 	 ized 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	making	was	a	new	blue	-	green	 water 	 y 	 	park	for	the	next	 water 	 y 	 	century	--	an	 amphi 	 bio 	 us 	 	park	,	if	you	will	.
so	get	your	tevas	on	.
so	you	can	imagine	scuba	 div 	 ing 	 	here	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	image	of	high	school	 student 	 s 	 	,	scuba	divers	that	we	 work 	 ed 	 	with	on	our	team	.
so	you	can	imagine	a	sort	of	new	manner	of	living	with	a	new	relationship	with	the	water	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	a	 hybrid 	 izing 	 	of	 re 	 creation 	 al 	 	and	science	 program 	 s 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 monitor 	 ing 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	new	 vocabul 	 ary 	 	word	for	the	brave	new	world	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	word	``	 flu 	 ps 	 y 	 	``	--
it	's	short	for	``	 float 	 ing 	 	 up 	 well 	 ing 	 	system	.	``
and	 th 	 is 	 	 glor 	 ious 	 	,	 read 	 ily 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	a	 float 	 ing 	 	raft	with	an	oyster	 nurse 	 ry 	 	 be 	 low 	 	.
so	the	water	is	 churn 	 ed 	 	through	 th 	 is 	 	raft	.
you	can	see	the	eight	 chamber 	 s 	 	on	the	side	host	little	baby	 oyster 	 s 	 	and	 essential 	 ly 	 	force	-	feed	them	.
so	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 hav 	 ing 	 	10	 oyster 	 s 	 	,	you	have	10,000	 oyster 	 s 	 	.
and	then	 t 	 hose 	 	 s 	 pat 	 	are	then	 seed 	 ed 	 	.
here	's	the	gowanus	future	with	the	oyster	 raft 	 s 	 	on	the	 shore 	 lines 	 	--	the	 flu 	 ps 	 ification 	 	of	the	gowanus	.
new	word	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	 show 	 ing 	 	oyster	 garden 	 ing 	 	for	the	community	 a 	 long 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 edge 	 s 	 	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	how	much	 f 	 un 	 	it	would	be	to	watch	the	 flu 	 ps 	 y 	 	 para 	 de 	 	and	cheer	on	the	oyster	 s 	 pat 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	go	down	to	the	reef	.
i	get	 ask 	 ed 	 	two	 question 	 s 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	project	.
one	is	:	why	is	n't	it	 happen 	 ing 	 	now	?	and	the	second	one	is	:	when	can	we	eat	the	 oyster 	 s 	 	?	and	the	answer	is	:	not	yet	,	they	're	 work 	 ing 	 	.	but	we	imagine	,	with	our	 calcul 	 ations 	 	,	that	by	2050	,	you	might	be	able	to	sink	your	 tee 	 th 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	gowanus	oyster	.
to	conclude	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	one	cross	-	section	of	one	piece	of	city	,	but	my	dream	is	,	my	hope	is	,	that	when	you	all	go	back	to	your	own	cities	that	we	can	start	to	work	together	and	 collabor 	 ate 	 	on	 re 	 making 	 	and	 reform 	 ing 	 	a	new	urban	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	a	more	 sustain 	 able 	 	,	a	more	 liv 	 able 	 	and	a	more	 delic 	 ious 	 	future	.
thank	you	.
