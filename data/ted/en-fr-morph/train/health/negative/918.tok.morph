chris	anderson	:	julian	,	welcome	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 report 	 ed 	 	that	wikileaks	,	your	baby	,	 ha 	 s 	 	,	in	the	last	few	 year 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	released	more	 class 	 ified 	 	 document 	 s 	 	than	the	rest	of	the	world	's	media	 combine 	 d 	 	.
can	that	possibly	be	true	?
julian	assange	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	can	it	possibly	be	true	?
it	's	a	worry	--	is	n't	it	?	--	that	the	rest	of	the	world	's	media	is	 do 	 ing 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	a	bad	job	that	a	little	group	of	 activist 	 s 	 	is	able	to	 re 	 lease 	 	more	of	that	type	of	information	than	the	rest	of	the	world	press	 combine 	 d 	 	.
ca	:	how	 do 	 es 	 	it	work	?
how	do	people	 re 	 lease 	 	the	 document 	 s 	 	?
and	how	do	you	secure	 the 	 ir 	 	 pri 	 vac 	 y 	 	?
ja	:	so	these	are	--	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	we	can	tell	--	 classic 	 al 	 	 whistl 	 e 	 blow 	 ers 	 	,
and	we	have	a	number	of	ways	for	them	to	get	information	to	us	.
so	we	use	 th 	 is 	 	state	-	of	-	the	-	art	 encrypt 	 ion 	 	to	 bounc 	 e 	 	stuff	around	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	to	hide	 trail 	 s 	 	,	pass	it	through	legal	 jurisdiction 	 s 	 	like	sweden	and	belgium	to	enact	 t 	 hose 	 	legal	 protect 	 ions 	 	.
we	get	information	in	the	mail	,	the	regular	 post 	 al 	 	mail	,	 encrypt 	 ed 	 	or	not	,	vet	it	like	a	regular	news	 organ 	 ization 	 	,	format	it	--	which	is	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	 quit 	 e 	 	hard	to	do	,	when	you	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	giant	 data 	 base 	 s 	 	of	information	--	 re 	 lease 	 	it	to	the	public	and	then	defend	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	against	the	 inevit 	 able 	 	legal	and	 politic 	 al 	 	 attack 	 s 	 	.
ca	:	so	you	make	an	effort	to	ensure	the	 document 	 s 	 	are	legitimate	,
but	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	 al 	 most 	 	never	know	who	the	 ident 	 ity 	 	of	the	source	is	?
ja	:	that	's	right	,	 yea 	 h 	 	.	 ver 	 y 	 	 rare 	 ly 	 	do	we	ever	know	,
and	if	we	find	out	at	some	stage	then	we	destroy	that	information	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	possible	.
god	damn	it	.
ca	:	i	think	that	's	the	cia	 ask 	 ing 	 	what	the	code	is	for	a	ted	 member 	 ship 	 	.
so	let	's	take	[	an	]	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	you	 leak 	 ed 	 	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
if	we	can	have	 th 	 is 	 	document	up	...
so	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	story	in	kenya	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
can	you	tell	us	what	you	 leak 	 ed 	 	and	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	?
ja	:	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	kroll	report	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	secret	 intellig 	 ence 	 	report	 commission 	 ed 	 	by	the	kenyan	government	after	 it 	 s 	 	election	in	2004	.
prior	to	2004	,	kenya	was	 rul 	 ed 	 	by	daniel	 a 	 rap 	 	moi	for	about	18	 year 	 s 	 	.
he	was	a	soft	dictator	of	kenya	.
and	when	kibaki	got	 in 	 to 	 	power	--	through	a	 coal 	 ition 	 	of	 force 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	clean	up	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	in	kenya	--	they	 commission 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	report	,	 s 	 pent 	 	about	two	million	 pound 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	and	an	 associate 	 d 	 	report	.
and	then	the	government	 s 	 at 	 	on	it	and	used	it	for	 politic 	 al 	 	leverage	on	moi	,	who	was	the	 rich 	 est 	 	man	--	still	is	the	 rich 	 est 	 	man	--	in	kenya	.
it	's	the	holy	 g 	 rail 	 	of	kenyan	 journal 	 ism 	 	.
so	i	went	there	in	2007	,	and	we	 manage 	 d 	 	to	get	hold	of	 th 	 is 	 	just	prior	to	the	election	--	the	national	election	,	december	28	.
when	we	released	that	report	,	we	did	so	three	 day 	 s 	 	after	the	new	 p 	 resident 	 	,	kibaki	,	had	 decide 	 d 	 	to	pal	up	with	the	man	that	he	was	going	to	clean	out	,	daniel	 a 	 rap 	 	moi	,
so	 th 	 is 	 	report	then	 be 	 came 	 	a	dead	 al 	 batross 	 	around	 p 	 resident 	 	kibaki	's	neck	.
ca	:	and	--	i	mean	,	to	cut	a	long	story	short	--	word	of	the	report	 leak 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	kenya	,	not	from	the	official	media	,	but	 in 	 direct 	 ly 	 	,
and	in	your	opinion	,	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 shift 	 ed 	 	the	election	.
ja	:	 yea 	 h 	 	.	so	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 came 	 	front	page	of	the	 guard 	 ian 	 	and	was	then	 print 	 ed 	 	in	all	the	 surround 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	of	kenya	,	in	tanzanian	and	south	african	press	.
and	so	it	came	in	from	the	 out 	 side 	 	.
and	that	,	after	a	couple	of	 day 	 s 	 	,	made	the	kenyan	press	feel	safe	to	talk	about	it	.
and	it	ran	for	20	 night 	 s 	 	straight	on	kenyan	tv	,	 shift 	 ed 	 	the	vote	by	10	percent	,	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	a	kenyan	 intellig 	 ence 	 	report	,	which	 change 	 d 	 	the	result	of	the	election	.
ca	:	 w 	 ow 	 	,	so	your	leak	 re 	 ally 	 	 sub 	 stantial 	 ly 	 	 change 	 d 	 	the	world	?
ja	:	 y 	 ep 	 	.
ca	:	here	's	--	we	're	going	to	just	show	a	short	clip	from	 th 	 is 	 	baghdad	 air 	 strike 	 	video	.
the	video	 it 	 self 	 	is	 long 	 er 	 	,
but	here	's	a	short	clip	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	 intens 	 e 	 	material	,	i	should	 war 	 n 	 	you	.
radio	:	...	just	 fuck 	 in 	 	'	,	once	you	get	on	'	em	just	open	'	em	up	.
i	see	your	element	,	uh	,	got	about	four	humvees	,	uh	,	out	 a 	 long 	 	...
you	're	clear	.	all	right	.	 fir 	 ing 	 	.
let	me	know	when	you	've	got	them	.	let	's	shoot	.
light	'	em	all	up	.
 c 	 ' 	 mon 	 	,	fire	!
keep	shoot	'	n.	keep	shoot	'	n	.
keep	shoot	'	n	.
hotel	...	bushmaster	two	-	six	,	bushmaster	two	-	six	,	we	need	to	move	,	time	now	!
all	right	,	we	just	 engag 	 ed 	 	all	eight	 individual 	 s 	 	.
 yea 	 h 	 	,	we	see	two	 bird 	 s 	 	[	 helicopter 	 s 	 	]	,	and	we	're	still	 fir 	 ing 	 	.
roger	.	i	got	'	em	.
two	-	six	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	two	-	six	,	we	're	mobile	.
 oop 	 s 	 	,	i	'm	sorry	.	what	was	going	on	?
god	damn	it	,	kyle	.	all	right	,	hahaha	.	i	hit	'	em	.
ca	:	so	,	what	was	the	impact	of	that	?
ja	:	the	impact	on	the	people	who	 work 	 ed 	 	on	it	was	severe	.
we	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	two	people	to	baghdad	to	further	research	that	story	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	the	first	of	three	 attack 	 s 	 	that	 occur 	 red 	 	in	that	scene	.
ca	:	so	,	i	mean	,	11	people	 di 	 ed 	 	in	that	attack	,	right	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	two	reuters	 employ 	 ees 	 	?
ja	:	 yea 	 h 	 	.	two	reuters	 employ 	 ees 	 	,	two	young	children	 we 	 re 	 	 wound 	 ed 	 	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	between	18	and	26	people	 kill 	 ed 	 	all	together	.
ca	:	and	 re 	 leas 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 caus 	 ed 	 	 wide 	 spread 	 	 out 	 rage 	 	.
what	was	the	key	element	of	 th 	 is 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 caus 	 ed 	 	the	 out 	 rage 	 	,	do	you	think	?
ja	:	i	do	n't	know	.	i	guess	people	can	see	the	gross	 dis 	 par 	 ity 	 	in	force	.
you	have	 guy 	 s 	 	 walk 	 ing 	 	in	a	 relax 	 ed 	 	way	down	the	street	,	and	then	an	apache	helicopter	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	up	at	one	kilometer	 fir 	 ing 	 	30	-	millimeter	 can 	 non 	 	 shell 	 s 	 	on	 every 	 one 	 	--	looking	for	any	excuse	to	do	so	--	and	 kill 	 ing 	 	people	 rescu 	 ing 	 	the	 wound 	 ed 	 	.
and	there	was	two	 journalist 	 s 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	that	 clear 	 ly 	 	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 insurgent 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	 the 	 ir 	 	full	-	time	job	.
ca	:	i	mean	,	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	 th 	 is 	 	u.s.	 intellig 	 ence 	 	analyst	,	bradley	manning	,	 arrest 	 ed 	 	,
and	it	's	 alle 	 ged 	 	that	he	 confess 	 ed 	 	in	a	chat	room	to	have	 leak 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	video	to	you	,	 a 	 long 	 	with	280,000	 class 	 ified 	 	u.s.	 emb 	 ass 	 y 	 	 cable 	 s 	 	.
i	mean	,	did	he	?
ja	:	we	have	 deni 	 ed 	 	 receiv 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 cable 	 s 	 	.
he	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	charged	,	about	five	 day 	 s 	 	ago	,	with	 obtain 	 ing 	 	150,000	 cable 	 s 	 	and	 re 	 leas 	 ing 	 	50	.
now	,	we	had	released	,	early	in	the	year	,	a	cable	from	the	reykjavik	u.s.	 emb 	 ass 	 y 	 	,
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	.
i	mean	,	i	was	a	known	 visit 	 or 	 	of	that	 emb 	 ass 	 y 	 	.
ca	:	i	mean	,	if	you	did	 receiv 	 e 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	u.s.	 emb 	 ass 	 y 	 	 diplomat 	 ic 	 	 cable 	 s 	 	...
ja	:	we	would	have	released	them	.	ja	:	 yea 	 h 	 	.
ja	:	well	,	 be 	 cause 	 	these	sort	of	 thing 	 s 	 	reveal	what	the	true	state	of	,	say	,	arab	 government 	 s 	 	are	like	,	the	true	human	-	 right 	 s 	 	 abuse 	 s 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 government 	 s 	 	.
if	you	look	at	 de 	 class 	 ified 	 	 cable 	 s 	 	,	that	's	the	sort	of	material	that	's	there	.
ca	:	so	let	's	talk	a	little	more	 broad 	 ly 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	mean	,	in	general	,	what	's	your	 philosoph 	 y 	 	?
why	is	it	right	to	 encourag 	 e 	 	 leak 	 ing 	 	of	secret	information	?
ja	:	well	,	there	's	a	question	 a 	 s 	 	to	what	sort	of	information	is	 import 	 ant 	 	in	the	world	,	what	sort	of	information	can	 achiev 	 e 	 	reform	.
and	there	's	a	lot	of	information	.
so	information	that	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	are	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	economic	effort	 in 	 to 	 	 conceal 	 ing 	 	,	that	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	good	signal	that	when	the	information	 get 	 s 	 	out	,	there	's	a	hope	of	it	 do 	 ing 	 	some	good	--
 be 	 cause 	 	the	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	that	know	it	best	,	that	know	it	from	the	 in 	 side 	 	out	,	are	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	work	to	conceal	it	.
and	that	's	what	we	've	found	in	practice	,
and	that	's	what	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 journal 	 ism 	 	is	.
ca	:	but	are	there	 risk 	 s 	 	with	that	,	either	to	the	 individual 	 s 	 	 concern 	 ed 	 	or	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	to	 socie 	 ty 	 	at	large	,	where	 leak 	 ing 	 	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	an	 un 	 intend 	 ed 	 	 con 	 sequence 	 	?
ja	:	not	that	we	have	 s 	 een 	 	with	 any 	 thing 	 	we	have	released	.
i	mean	,	we	have	a	harm	 immun 	 ization 	 	policy	.
we	have	a	way	of	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	information	that	 ha 	 s 	 	sort	of	personal	--	 personal 	 ly 	 	 identify 	 ing 	 	information	in	it	.
but	there	are	legitimate	 secret 	 s 	 	--	you	know	,	your	 record 	 s 	 	with	your	doctor	;	that	's	a	legitimate	secret	--
but	we	deal	with	 whistl 	 e 	 blow 	 ers 	 	that	are	coming	forward	that	are	 re 	 ally 	 	sort	of	well	-	 motiv 	 ated 	 	.
ca	:	so	they	are	well	-	 motiv 	 ated 	 	.
and	what	would	you	say	to	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	the	,	you	know	,	the	parent	of	 some 	 one 	 	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	son	is	out	 serv 	 ing 	 	the	u.s.	 militar 	 y 	 	,	and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	you	know	what	,
you	've	put	up	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 some 	 one 	 	had	an	incentive	to	put	out	.
it	 show 	 s 	 	a	u.s.	soldier	 laugh 	 ing 	 	at	people	 dy 	 ing 	 	.
that	 give 	 s 	 	the	impression	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 give 	 n 	 	the	impression	,	to	 million 	 s 	 	of	people	around	the	world	that	u.s.	 soldier 	 s 	 	are	 in 	 human 	 	people	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	they	're	not	.	my	son	is	n't	.	how	 da 	 re 	 	you	?	``	what	would	you	say	to	that	?
ja	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	we	do	get	a	lot	of	that	.
but	remember	,	the	people	in	baghdad	,	the	people	in	 ir 	 aq 	 	,	the	people	in	afghanistan	--	they	do	n't	need	to	see	the	video	;	they	see	it	every	day	.
so	it	's	not	going	to	change	 the 	 ir 	 	opinion	.	it	's	not	going	to	change	 the 	 ir 	 	 per 	 ception 	 	.
that	's	what	they	see	every	day	.
it	will	change	the	 per 	 ception 	 	and	opinion	of	the	people	who	are	 pay 	 ing 	 	for	it	all	,
and	that	's	our	hope	.
ca	:	so	you	found	a	way	to	shine	light	 in 	 to 	 	what	you	see	 a 	 s 	 	these	sort	of	dark	 secret 	 s 	 	in	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	and	in	government	.
light	is	good	.
but	do	you	see	any	 iron 	 y 	 	in	the	fact	that	,	in	order	for	you	to	shine	that	light	,	you	have	to	,	 your 	 self 	 	,	create	secrecy	around	your	 source 	 s 	 	?
ja	:	not	 re 	 ally 	 	.	i	mean	,	we	do	n't	have	any	wikileaks	 dis 	 sidents 	 	yet	.
we	do	n't	have	 source 	 s 	 	who	are	 dis 	 sidents 	 	on	other	 source 	 s 	 	.
should	they	come	forward	,	that	would	be	a	 trick 	 y 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	for	us	,
but	we	're	 pre 	 sum 	 ably 	 	 act 	 ing 	 	in	 s 	 uch 	 	a	way	that	people	feel	 moral 	 ly 	 	 compel 	 led 	 	to	 continu 	 e 	 	our	mission	,	not	to	screw	it	up	.
ca	:	i	'd	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	 interest 	 ed 	 	,	just	based	on	what	we	've	heard	so	far	--	i	'm	 cur 	 ious 	 	 a 	 s 	 	to	the	opinion	in	the	ted	audience	.
you	know	,	there	might	be	a	couple	of	 view 	 s 	 	of	wikileaks	and	of	julian	.
you	know	,	hero	--	people	's	hero	--	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	light	.
 danger 	 ous 	 	 trouble 	 maker 	 	.
who	's	got	the	hero	view	?
who	's	got	the	 danger 	 ous 	 	 trouble 	 maker 	 	view	?
ja	:	oh	,	come	on	.	there	must	be	some	.
ca	:	it	's	a	soft	crowd	,	julian	,	a	soft	crowd	.
we	have	to	try	better	.	let	's	show	them	 an 	 other 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
now	here	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	you	have	n't	yet	 leak 	 ed 	 	,	but	i	think	for	ted	you	are	.
i	mean	it	's	an	 intrigu 	 ing 	 	story	that	's	just	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	right	?
what	is	 th 	 is 	 	?
ja	:	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 s 	 ample 	 	of	what	we	do	sort	of	every	day	.
so	late	last	year	--	in	november	last	year	--	there	was	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	well	 blow 	 out 	 s 	 	in	albania	,	like	the	well	 blow 	 out 	 	in	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	of	mexico	,	but	not	 quit 	 e 	 	 a 	 s 	 	big	.
and	we	got	a	report	--	a	sort	of	 engineer 	 ing 	 	analysis	 in 	 to 	 	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	--	 say 	 ing 	 	that	,	in	fact	,	security	 guard 	 s 	 	from	some	rival	,	 vari 	 ous 	 	 com 	 pet 	 ing 	 	oil	 firm 	 s 	 	had	,	in	fact	,	 park 	 ed 	 	 truck 	 s 	 	there	and	blown	them	up	.
and	part	of	the	albanian	government	was	in	 th 	 is 	 	,	etc	.	,	etc	.
and	the	 engineer 	 ing 	 	report	had	 noth 	 ing 	 	on	the	top	of	it	,
so	it	was	an	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	difficult	document	for	us	.
we	could	n't	 ver 	 ify 	 	it	 be 	 cause 	 	we	did	n't	know	who	wrote	it	and	 k 	 new 	 	what	it	was	about	.
so	we	 we 	 re 	 	kind	of	 skeptic 	 al 	 	that	 may 	 be 	 	it	was	a	 com 	 pet 	 ing 	 	oil	firm	just	sort	of	 play 	 ing 	 	the	issue	up	.
so	under	that	 bas 	 is 	 	,	we	put	it	out	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	look	,	we	're	 skeptic 	 al 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	thing	.
we	do	n't	know	,	but	what	can	we	do	?
the	material	 look 	 s 	 	good	,	it	 feel 	 s 	 	right	,	but	we	just	ca	n't	 ver 	 ify 	 	it	.	``
and	we	then	got	a	letter	just	 th 	 is 	 	week	from	the	company	who	wrote	it	,	 want 	 ing 	 	to	track	down	the	source	--	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	we	want	to	track	down	the	source	.	``
and	we	 we 	 re 	 	like	,	``	oh	,	tell	us	more	.
what	document	is	it	,	 precise 	 ly 	 	,	you	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	?
can	you	show	that	you	had	legal	 author 	 ity 	 	over	that	document	?
is	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 your 	 s 	 	?	``
so	they	 s 	 ent 	 	us	 th 	 is 	 	screen	shot	with	the	author	in	the	 micro 	 soft 	 	word	id	.
 yea 	 h 	 	.
that	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	a	lot	 th 	 ough 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	like	one	of	our	 method 	 s 	 	of	 identify 	 ing 	 	,	of	 ver 	 ifying 	 	,	what	a	material	is	,	is	to	try	and	get	these	 guy 	 s 	 	to	write	 letter 	 s 	 	.
ca	:	 yea 	 h 	 	.	have	you	had	information	from	 in 	 side 	 	bp	?
ja	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	we	have	a	lot	,	but	i	mean	,	at	the	moment	,	we	are	 under 	 going 	 	a	sort	of	serious	 fund 	 raising 	 	and	 engineer 	 ing 	 	effort	.
so	our	 public 	 ation 	 	rate	over	the	past	few	 month 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	sort	of	 minim 	 ized 	 	while	we	're	re	-	 engineer 	 ing 	 	our	back	 system 	 s 	 	for	the	 phenomen 	 al 	 	public	interest	that	we	have	.
that	's	a	problem	.
i	mean	,	like	any	sort	of	growing	 start 	 up 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	,	we	are	sort	of	 overwhelm 	 ed 	 	by	our	growth	,
and	that	 mean 	 s 	 	we	're	 get 	 ting 	 	enormous	 quant 	 ity 	 	of	 whistl 	 eb 	 lower 	 	 dis 	 closure 	 s 	 	of	a	 ver 	 y 	 	high	 calib 	 er 	 	but	do	n't	have	 en 	 ough 	 	people	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	process	and	vet	 th 	 is 	 	information	.
ca	:	so	that	's	the	key	 bottle 	 neck 	 	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	 journalist 	 ic 	 	 volunteer 	 s 	 	and	/	or	the	 fund 	 ing 	 	of	 journalist 	 ic 	 	 s 	 al 	 aries 	 	?
ja	:	 y 	 ep 	 	.	 yea 	 h 	 	,	and	 trust 	 ed 	 	people	.
i	mean	,	we	're	an	 organ 	 ization 	 	that	is	hard	to	grow	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	sort	of	material	we	deal	with	,
so	we	have	to	 re 	 structure 	 	in	order	to	have	people	who	will	deal	with	the	highest	national	security	stuff	,	and	then	lower	security	 case 	 s 	 	.
ca	:	so	help	us	understand	a	bit	about	you	 personal 	 ly 	 	and	how	you	came	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	i	think	i	read	that	 a 	 s 	 	a	kid	you	went	to	37	different	 school 	 s 	 	.
can	that	be	right	?
ja	:	well	,	my	 parent 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	in	the	movie	business	and	then	on	the	run	from	a	cult	,	so	the	combination	between	the	two	...
ca	:	i	mean	,	a	 psycho 	 logist 	 	might	say	that	's	a	recipe	for	 breed 	 ing 	 	 para 	 no 	 ia 	 	.
ja	:	what	,	the	movie	business	?
ca	:	and	you	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 so 	 	--	i	mean	,	you	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 so 	 	a	 hack 	 er 	 	at	an	early	age	and	ran	 in 	 to 	 	the	 author 	 ities 	 	early	on	.
ja	:	well	,	i	was	a	journalist	.
you	know	,	i	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	young	journalist	activist	at	an	early	age	.
i	wrote	a	magazine	,	was	 prosecut 	 ed 	 	for	it	when	i	was	a	teenager	.
so	you	have	to	be	 care 	 ful 	 	with	 hack 	 er 	 	.
i	mean	there	's	like	--	there	's	a	method	that	can	be	 deploy 	 ed 	 	for	 vari 	 ous 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	at	the	moment	,	it	's	 most 	 ly 	 	 deploy 	 ed 	 	by	the	russian	mafia	in	order	to	steal	your	 grand 	 mother 	 	's	bank	 account 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	phrase	is	not	,
not	 a 	 s 	 	nice	 a 	 s 	 	it	used	to	be	.
ca	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	well	,	i	 certain 	 ly 	 	do	n't	think	you	're	 steal 	 ing 	 	 any 	 one 	 	's	 grand 	 mother 	 	's	bank	account	,
but	what	about	your	core	 value 	 s 	 	?
can	you	give	us	a	sense	of	what	they	are	and	 may 	 be 	 	some	incident	in	your	life	that	 help 	 ed 	 	determine	them	?
ja	:	i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	about	the	incident	.
but	the	core	 value 	 s 	 	:	well	,	 cap 	 able 	 	,	 gen 	 er 	 ous 	 	men	do	not	create	 victim 	 s 	 	;
they	nurture	 victim 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	 some 	 thing 	 	from	my	father	and	 some 	 thing 	 	from	other	 cap 	 able 	 	,	 gen 	 er 	 ous 	 	men	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	in	my	life	.
ca	:	 cap 	 able 	 	,	 gen 	 er 	 ous 	 	men	do	not	create	 victim 	 s 	 	;	they	nurture	 victim 	 s 	 	?
ja	:	 yea 	 h 	 	.	and	you	know	,	i	'm	a	 comb 	 ative 	 	person	,	so	i	'm	not	 actual 	 ly 	 	so	big	on	the	nurture	,
but	some	way	--	there	is	 an 	 other 	 	way	of	 nurtur 	 ing 	 	 victim 	 s 	 	,	which	is	to	police	 perpet 	 rator 	 s 	 	of	crime	.
and	so	that	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	in	my	character	for	a	long	time	.
ca	:	so	just	tell	us	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	in	the	last	minute	,	the	story	:	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	iceland	?
you	 bas 	 ically 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	there	,	ran	 in 	 to 	 	trouble	with	a	bank	,	then	the	news	service	there	was	 inju 	 n 	 cted 	 	from	running	the	story	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	they	 public 	 ized 	 	your	side	.
that	made	you	 ver 	 y 	 	high	-	profile	in	iceland	.	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	next	?
ja	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	great	case	,	you	know	.
iceland	went	through	 th 	 is 	 	financial	crisis	.
it	was	the	 hard 	 est 	 	hit	of	any	country	in	the	world	.
 it 	 s 	 	 bank 	 ing 	 	sector	was	10	 time 	 s 	 	the	gdp	of	the	rest	of	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	so	we	 re 	 lease 	 	 th 	 is 	 	report	in	july	last	year	.
and	the	national	tv	station	was	 inju 	 n 	 cted 	 	five	 minute 	 s 	 	before	it	went	on	air	,
like	out	of	a	movie	:	 in 	 junction 	 	 land 	 ed 	 	on	the	news	desk	,	and	the	news	 read 	 er 	 	was	like	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	never	 happen 	 ed 	 	before	.	what	do	we	do	?	``
well	,	we	just	show	the	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	,	for	all	that	time	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 fill 	 er 	 	,
and	we	 be 	 came 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	famous	in	iceland	,	went	to	iceland	and	spoke	about	 th 	 is 	 	issue	.
and	there	was	a	 feel 	 ing 	 	in	the	community	that	that	should	never	happen	 aga 	 in 	 	,
and	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	,	 work 	 ing 	 	with	icelandic	 politic 	 ians 	 	and	some	other	 inter 	 national 	 	legal	 expert 	 s 	 	,	we	put	together	a	new	sort	of	package	of	 legisl 	 ation 	 	for	iceland	to	sort	of	 be 	 come 	 	an	 off 	 shore 	 	 have 	 n 	 	for	the	free	press	,	with	the	 strong 	 est 	 	 journalist 	 ic 	 	 protect 	 ions 	 	in	the	world	,	with	a	new	 no 	 bel 	 	prize	for	 free 	 dom 	 	of	speech	.
iceland	's	a	nordic	country	,	so	,	like	norway	,	it	's	able	to	tap	 in 	 to 	 	the	system	.
and	just	a	month	ago	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	 pass 	 ed 	 	by	the	icelandic	parliament	 un 	 anim 	 ously 	 	.	ca	:	 w 	 ow 	 	.
last	question	,	julian	.
when	you	think	of	the	future	then	,	do	you	think	it	's	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	be	big	brother	 exert 	 ing 	 	more	control	,	more	secrecy	,	or	us	 watch 	 ing 	 	big	brother	,	or	it	's	just	all	to	be	 play 	 ed 	 	for	either	way	?
ja	:	i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	which	way	it	's	going	to	go	.
i	mean	,	there	's	enormous	 pressure 	 s 	 	to	 harmon 	 ize 	 	 free 	 dom 	 	of	speech	 legisl 	 ation 	 	and	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	 legisl 	 ation 	 	around	the	world	--	 with 	 in 	 	the	e.u	.	,	between	 chin 	 a 	 	and	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
which	way	is	it	going	to	go	?	it	's	hard	to	see	.
that	's	why	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	time	to	be	in	--
 be 	 cause 	 	with	just	a	little	bit	of	effort	,	we	can	shift	it	one	way	or	the	other	.
ca	:	well	,	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	i	'm	 reflect 	 ing 	 	the	audience	's	opinion	to	say	,	julian	,	be	 care 	 ful 	 	,	and	all	power	to	you	.
ja	:	thank	you	,	chris	.
