roger	ebert	:	these	are	my	 word 	 s 	 	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	my	voice	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	alex	,	the	best	computer	voice	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	find	,	which	 come 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	standard	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	on	every	macintosh	.
for	most	of	my	life	,	i	never	 g 	 ave 	 	a	second	thought	to	my	ability	to	speak	.
it	was	like	 breath 	 ing 	 	.
in	 t 	 hose 	 	 day 	 s 	 	,	i	was	living	in	a	fool	's	 para 	 dis 	 e 	 	.
after	 s 	 urge 	 ries 	 	for	cancer	took	away	my	ability	to	speak	,	eat	or	drink	,	i	was	 force 	 d 	 	to	enter	 th 	 is 	 	virtual	world	in	which	a	computer	 do 	 es 	 	some	of	my	living	for	me	.
for	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 day 	 s 	 	now	,	we	have	 enjoy 	 ed 	 	 brilli 	 ant 	 	and	articulate	 speaker 	 s 	 	here	at	ted	.
i	used	to	be	able	to	talk	like	that	.
 may 	 be 	 	i	was	n't	 a 	 s 	 	smart	,	but	i	was	at	 l 	 east 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 talk 	 ative 	 	.
i	want	to	devote	my	talk	 to 	 day 	 	to	the	act	of	 s 	 peaking 	 	 it 	 self 	 	,	and	how	the	act	of	 s 	 peaking 	 	or	not	 s 	 peaking 	 	is	 ti 	 ed 	 	so	 in 	 del 	 ibly 	 	to	one	's	 ident 	 ity 	 	 a 	 s 	 	to	force	the	birth	of	a	new	person	when	it	is	taken	away	.	 how 	 ever 	 	,	i	've	found	that	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	a	computer	voice	for	any	great	length	of	time	can	be	 mono 	 ton 	 ous 	 	.
so	i	've	 decide 	 d 	 	to	recruit	some	of	my	ted	 friend 	 s 	 	to	read	my	 word 	 s 	 	 a 	 loud 	 	for	me	.
i	will	start	with	my	wife	,	chaz	.
chaz	ebert	:	it	was	chaz	who	stood	by	my	side	through	three	 attempt 	 s 	 	to	 re 	 construct 	 	my	jaw	and	 re 	 store 	 	my	ability	to	speak	.
going	 in 	 to 	 	the	first	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	for	a	 recur 	 rence 	 	of	 saliva 	 ry 	 	cancer	in	2006	,	i	 expect 	 ed 	 	to	be	out	of	the	hospital	in	time	to	return	to	my	movie	review	show	,	'	ebert	and	roeper	at	the	 movie 	 s 	 	.	'
i	had	pre	-	taped	 en 	 ough 	 	 show 	 s 	 	to	get	me	through	six	 week 	 s 	 	of	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	and	recuperation	.
the	 doctor 	 s 	 	took	a	fibula	bone	from	my	leg	and	some	tissue	from	my	shoulder	to	fashion	 in 	 to 	 	a	new	jaw	.
my	tongue	,	larynx	and	vocal	 cord 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	still	 health 	 y 	 	and	 un 	 affect 	 ed 	 	.
ce	:	i	was	 optimist 	 ic 	 	,	and	all	was	right	with	the	world	.
the	first	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	was	a	great	success	.
i	saw	 my 	 self 	 	in	the	mirror	and	i	 look 	 ed 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	.
two	 week 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	i	was	ready	to	return	home	.
i	was	using	my	ipod	to	play	the	leonard	cohen	song	'	i	'm	your	man	'	for	my	 doctor 	 s 	 	and	 nurse 	 s 	 	.
 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	i	had	an	episode	of	 catastroph 	 ic 	 	 ble 	 ed 	 ing 	 	.
my	 car 	 oti 	 d 	 	 art 	 ery 	 	had	 rupture 	 d 	 	.
thank	god	i	was	still	in	my	hospital	room	and	my	 doctor 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	right	there	.
chaz	told	me	that	if	that	song	had	n't	 play 	 ed 	 	for	so	long	,	i	might	have	 al 	 ready 	 	 be 	 en 	 	in	the	car	,	on	the	way	home	,	and	would	have	 di 	 ed 	 	right	there	and	then	.
so	thank	you	,	leonard	cohen	,	for	saving	my	life	.
there	was	a	second	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	--	which	held	up	for	five	or	six	 day 	 s 	 	and	then	it	 al 	 so 	 	fell	 a 	 part 	 	.
and	then	a	third	attempt	,	which	 al 	 so 	 	 patch 	 ed 	 	me	back	together	 pre 	 tty 	 	well	,	 un 	 til 	 	it	 fail 	 ed 	 	.
a	doctor	from	brazil	 s 	 aid 	 	he	had	never	 s 	 een 	 	 any 	 one 	 	 surviv 	 e 	 	a	 car 	 oti 	 d 	 	 art 	 ery 	 	rupture	.
and	before	i	left	the	hospital	,	after	a	year	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 hospital 	 ized 	 	,	i	had	seven	 rupture 	 s 	 	of	my	 car 	 oti 	 d 	 	 art 	 ery 	 	.
there	was	no	 part 	 icular 	 	day	when	 any 	 one 	 	told	me	i	would	never	speak	 aga 	 in 	 	;	it	just	sort	of	 be 	 came 	 	obvious	.
human	speech	is	an	 ing 	 en 	 ious 	 	 manipul 	 ation 	 	of	our	breath	 with 	 in 	 	the	sound	chamber	of	our	mouth	and	 respirator 	 y 	 	system	.
we	need	to	be	able	to	hold	and	 manipul 	 ate 	 	that	breath	in	order	to	form	 sound 	 s 	 	.
 there 	 fore 	 	,	the	system	must	be	 essential 	 ly 	 	 air 	 tight 	 	in	order	to	capture	air	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	had	lost	my	jaw	,	i	could	no	 long 	 er 	 	form	a	seal	,	and	 there 	 fore 	 	my	tongue	and	all	of	my	other	vocal	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	was	 render 	 ed 	 	 power 	 less 	 	.
dean	ornish	:	at	first	for	a	long	time	,	i	wrote	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	in	 note 	 book 	 s 	 	.
then	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	 ty 	 ping 	 	 word 	 s 	 	on	my	 lap 	 top 	 	and	using	 it 	 s 	 	built	in	voice	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	 fast 	 er 	 	,	and	 no 	 body 	 	had	to	try	to	read	my	 hand 	 writing 	 	.
i	 tri 	 ed 	 	out	 vari 	 ous 	 	computer	 voice 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	 on 	 line 	 	,	and	for	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 month 	 s 	 	i	had	a	british	accent	,	which	chaz	 call 	 ed 	 	 s 	 ir 	 	lawrence	.	``
``	it	was	the	 clear 	 est 	 	i	could	find	.
then	apple	released	the	alex	voice	,	which	was	the	best	i	'd	heard	.
it	 k 	 new 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	an	 ex 	 clam 	 ation 	 	point	and	a	question	mark	.
when	it	saw	a	period	,	it	 k 	 new 	 	how	to	make	a	sentence	sound	like	it	was	 end 	 ing 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 stay 	 ing 	 	up	in	the	air	.
there	are	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	html	 code 	 s 	 	you	can	use	to	control	the	 tim 	 ing 	 	and	 inf 	 le 	 ction 	 	of	computer	 voice 	 s 	 	,	and	i	've	 experiment 	 ed 	 	with	them	.
for	me	,	they	share	a	fundamental	problem	:	they	're	too	 s 	 low 	 	.
when	i	find	 my 	 self 	 	in	a	 conversation 	 al 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	i	need	to	type	fast	and	to	jump	right	in	.
people	do	n't	have	the	time	or	the	patience	to	wait	for	me	to	fool	around	with	the	 code 	 s 	 	for	every	word	or	phrase	.
but	what	value	do	we	place	on	the	sound	of	our	own	voice	?
how	 do 	 es 	 	that	affect	who	you	are	 a 	 s 	 	a	person	?
when	people	hear	alex	 s 	 peaking 	 	my	 word 	 s 	 	,	do	they	experience	a	 dis 	 connect 	 	?
 do 	 es 	 	that	create	a	 separat 	 ion 	 	or	a	distance	from	one	person	to	the	next	?
how	did	i	feel	not	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	speak	?
i	felt	,	and	i	still	feel	,	a	lot	of	distance	from	the	human	 main 	 stream 	 	.
i	've	 be 	 come 	 	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	when	i	'm	 separat 	 ed 	 	from	my	 lap 	 top 	 	.
even	then	,	i	'm	aware	that	most	people	have	little	patience	for	my	 s 	 peaking 	 	 difficult 	 ies 	 	.
so	chaz	 suggest 	 ed 	 	 find 	 ing 	 	a	company	that	could	make	a	 custom 	 ized 	 	voice	using	my	tv	show	voice	from	a	period	of	30	 year 	 s 	 	.
at	first	i	was	against	it	.
i	thought	it	would	be	 creep 	 y 	 	to	hear	my	own	voice	coming	from	a	computer	.
there	was	 some 	 thing 	 	 comfort 	 ing 	 	about	a	voice	that	was	not	my	own	.
but	i	 decide 	 d 	 	then	to	just	give	it	a	try	.
so	we	 contact 	 ed 	 	a	company	in	scotland	that	 create 	 d 	 	 personal 	 ized 	 	computer	 voice 	 s 	 	.
they	'd	never	made	one	from	 previous 	 ly 	 	-	 record 	 ed 	 	 material 	 s 	 	.
all	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 voice 	 s 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	made	by	a	speaker	 record 	 ing 	 	original	 word 	 s 	 	in	a	control	booth	.
but	they	 we 	 re 	 	 will 	 ing 	 	to	give	it	a	try	.
so	i	 s 	 ent 	 	them	 man 	 y 	 	 hour 	 s 	 	of	 record 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	my	voice	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	audio	 comment 	 ary 	 	 track 	 s 	 	that	i	'd	made	for	 movie 	 s 	 	on	dvds	.
and	it	 sound 	 ed 	 	like	me	,	it	 re 	 ally 	 	did	.
there	was	a	reason	for	that	;	it	was	me	.
but	it	was	n't	that	simple	.
the	 tape 	 s 	 	from	my	tv	show	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 ver 	 y 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	there	 we 	 re 	 	too	 man 	 y 	 	other	 kind 	 s 	 	of	audio	 involve 	 d 	 	--	movie	 sound 	 track 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	or	gene	siskel	 argu 	 ing 	 	with	me	--
and	my	 word 	 s 	 	often	had	a	 part 	 icular 	 	 emphas 	 is 	 	that	did	n't	fit	 in 	 to 	 	a	sentence	well	 en 	 ough 	 	.
i	'll	let	you	hear	a	 s 	 ample 	 	of	that	voice	.
these	are	a	few	of	the	 comment 	 s 	 	i	 record 	 ed 	 	for	use	when	chaz	and	i	 appear 	 ed 	 	on	the	oprah	winfrey	program	.
and	here	's	the	voice	we	call	roger	jr.	or	roger	2.0	.
roger	2.0	:	oprah	,	i	ca	n't	tell	you	how	great	it	is	to	be	back	on	your	show	.
we	have	 be 	 en 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	for	a	long	time	,	and	now	here	we	are	 aga 	 in 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	version	of	my	computer	voice	.
it	still	 need 	 s 	 	 improve 	 ment 	 	,	but	at	 l 	 east 	 	it	 sound 	 s 	 	like	me	and	not	like	hal	9000	.
when	i	heard	it	the	first	time	,	it	 s 	 ent 	 	 chill 	 s 	 	down	my	 s 	 pine 	 	.
when	i	type	 any 	 thing 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	voice	will	speak	 what 	 ever 	 	i	type	.
when	i	read	 some 	 thing 	 	,	it	will	read	in	my	voice	.
i	have	 type 	 d 	 	these	 word 	 s 	 	in	advance	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	did	n't	think	it	would	be	 thrill 	 ing 	 	to	 s 	 it 	 	here	 watch 	 ing 	 	me	 ty 	 ping 	 	.
the	voice	was	 create 	 d 	 	by	a	company	in	scotland	named	cereproc	.
it	 make 	 s 	 	me	feel	good	that	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 word 	 s 	 	you	are	 hear 	 ing 	 	 we 	 re 	 	first	spoken	while	i	was	 comment 	 ing 	 	on	``	casablanca	``	and	``	citizen	kane	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	voice	they	've	 create 	 d 	 	for	an	individual	.
there	are	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 voice 	 s 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	for	 computer 	 s 	 	,	but	they	all	sound	like	 some 	 body 	 	else	,	while	 th 	 is 	 	voice	 sound 	 s 	 	like	me	.
i	plan	to	use	it	on	 tele 	 vision 	 	,	radio	and	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
people	who	need	a	voice	should	know	that	most	 computer 	 s 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	come	with	built	-	in	 s 	 peaking 	 	 system 	 s 	 	.
 man 	 y 	 	blind	people	use	them	to	read	 page 	 s 	 	on	the	web	to	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
but	i	've	got	to	say	,	in	first	grade	,	they	 s 	 aid 	 	i	 talk 	 ed 	 	too	much	,	and	now	i	still	can	.
roger	ebert	:	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	hear	,	it	 sound 	 s 	 	like	me	,	but	the	 word 	 s 	 	jump	up	and	down	.
the	flow	is	n't	natural	.
the	good	people	in	scotland	are	still	 improv 	 ing 	 	my	voice	,	and	i	'm	 optimist 	 ic 	 	about	it	.
but	so	far	,	the	apple	alex	voice	is	the	best	one	i	've	heard	.
i	wrote	a	blog	about	it	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	got	a	comment	from	the	 a 	 ctor 	 	who	 play 	 ed 	 	alex	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	he	 record 	 ed 	 	 man 	 y 	 	long	 hour 	 s 	 	in	 vari 	 ous 	 	 in 	 ton 	 ations 	 	to	be	used	in	the	voice	.

john	hunter	:	all	my	life	i	was	a	 motor 	 mouth 	 	.	now	i	have	spoken	my	last	 word 	 s 	 	,	and	i	do	n't	even	remember	for	 s 	 ure 	 	what	they	 we 	 re 	 	.
i	feel	like	the	hero	of	that	harlan	ellison	story	titled	``	i	have	no	mouth	and	i	must	 s 	 cream 	 	.	``

that	 ha 	 s 	 	 most 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	my	 life 	 time 	 	.
some	of	the	famous	early	 computer 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	built	in	my	 home 	 town 	 	of	urbana	,	the	 birth 	 place 	 	of	hal	9000	.
when	i	heard	the	 amaz 	 ing 	 	talk	by	salman	khan	on	wednesday	,	about	the	khan	academy	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	that	 teach 	 es 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 subject 	 s 	 	to	 student 	 s 	 	all	over	the	world	,	i	had	a	 flash 	 back 	 	.
it	was	about	1960	.	 a 	 s 	 	a	local	 news 	 paper 	 	 report 	 er 	 	still	in	high	school	,	i	was	 s 	 ent 	 	over	to	the	computer	lab	of	the	university	of	illinois	to	interview	the	 creator 	 s 	 	of	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	plato	.
the	 initi 	 al 	 s 	 	stood	for	 programm 	 ed 	 	logic	for	 autom 	 ated 	 	 teach 	 ing 	 	 operation 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	computer	-	 assist 	 ed 	 	 instruct 	 ion 	 	system	,	which	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 day 	 s 	 	ran	on	a	computer	named	illiac	.
the	 programm 	 ers 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	it	could	assist	 student 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	.
i	doubt	,	on	that	day	50	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	they	even	 dream 	 ed 	 	of	what	salman	khan	 ha 	 s 	 	 accomplish 	 ed 	 	.
but	that	's	not	the	point	.
the	point	is	plato	was	 on 	 ly 	 	50	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	an	instant	in	time	.

i	can	not	speak	;	i	can	 on 	 ly 	 	type	so	fast	.
computer	 voice 	 s 	 	are	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	not	 ver 	 y 	 	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	,	but	with	my	computer	,	i	can	communicate	more	 wide 	 ly 	 	than	ever	before	.
i	feel	 a 	 s 	 	if	my	blog	,	my	email	,	twitter	and	facebook	have	 give 	 n 	 	me	a	 substitut 	 e 	 	for	 every 	 day 	 	conversation	.
they	are	n't	an	 improve 	 ment 	 	,	but	they	're	the	best	i	can	do	.
they	give	me	a	way	to	speak	.
not	 every 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	the	patience	of	my	wife	,	chaz	.
but	 on 	 line 	 	,	 every 	 body 	 	 speak 	 s 	 	at	the	same	speed	.
 th 	 is 	 	whole	adventure	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	 learn 	 ing 	 	experience	.
every	time	there	was	a	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	that	 fail 	 ed 	 	,	i	was	left	with	a	little	less	 fl 	 esh 	 	and	bone	.
now	i	have	no	jaw	left	at	all	.
while	 harvest 	 ing 	 	tissue	from	both	my	 shoulder 	 s 	 	,	the	 s 	 urge 	 ries 	 	left	me	with	back	pain	and	 reduc 	 ed 	 	my	ability	to	walk	 eas 	 ily 	 	.
 iron 	 ic 	 	that	my	 leg 	 s 	 	are	fine	,	and	it	's	my	 shoulder 	 s 	 	that	 s 	 low 	 	up	my	walk	.
when	you	see	me	 to 	 day 	 	,	i	look	like	the	phantom	of	the	opera	.
but	no	you	do	n't	.
it	is	human	nature	to	look	at	 some 	 one 	 	like	me	and	 assum 	 e 	 	i	have	lost	some	of	my	 mar 	 ble 	 s 	 	.
people	--
people	talk	 loud 	 ly 	 	--
i	'm	so	sorry	.
excuse	me	.
people	talk	 loud 	 ly 	 	and	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	to	me	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	they	 assum 	 e 	 	i	am	deaf	.
there	are	people	who	do	n't	want	to	make	eye	contact	.
 believ 	 e 	 	me	,	he	did	n't	mean	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	--	 any 	 way 	 	,	let	me	just	read	it	.
you	should	never	let	your	wife	read	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	is	human	nature	to	look	away	from	 ill 	 ness 	 	.
we	do	n't	enjoy	a	 re 	 mind 	 er 	 	of	our	own	fragile	 mortal 	 ity 	 	.
that	's	why	writing	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	a	 life 	 saver 	 	for	me	.
my	ability	to	think	and	write	have	not	 be 	 en 	 	 affect 	 ed 	 	.
and	on	the	web	,	my	real	voice	 find 	 s 	 	 express 	 ion 	 	.
i	have	 al 	 so 	 	met	 man 	 y 	 	other	 dis 	 able 	 d 	 	people	who	communicate	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
one	of	my	twitter	 friend 	 s 	 	can	type	 on 	 ly 	 	with	his	 to 	 es 	 	.
one	of	the	 funni 	 est 	 	 blog 	 s 	 	on	the	web	is	written	by	a	friend	of	mine	named	 smart 	 ass 	 	 c 	 ripple 	 	.	google	him	and	he	will	make	you	laugh	.
all	of	these	people	are	 say 	 ing 	 	,	in	one	way	or	 an 	 other 	 	,	that	what	you	see	is	not	all	you	get	.
so	i	have	not	come	here	to	complain	.
i	have	much	to	make	me	happy	and	 reliev 	 ed 	 	.
i	seem	,	for	the	time	 be 	 ing 	 	,	to	be	cancer	-	free	.
i	am	writing	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	ever	.
i	am	productive	.
if	i	 we 	 re 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	condition	at	any	point	before	a	few	 cosmo 	 logical 	 	 instant 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	would	be	 a 	 s 	 	 isolate 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	hermit	.
i	would	be	trapped	 in 	 side 	 	my	head	.
 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	rush	of	human	knowledge	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	digital	revolution	,	i	have	a	voice	,	and	i	do	not	need	to	 s 	 cream 	 	.
re	:	wait	.	i	have	one	more	thing	to	add	.
a	guy	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	psychiatrist	.
the	psychiatrist	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	you	're	crazy	.	``
the	guy	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	want	a	second	opinion	.	``
the	psychiatrist	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	all	right	,	you	're	 ug 	 ly 	 	.	``
you	all	know	the	test	for	artificial	 intellig 	 ence 	 	--	the	turing	test	.
a	human	 judg 	 e 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	conversation	with	a	human	and	a	computer	.
if	the	 judg 	 e 	 	ca	n't	tell	the	machine	 a 	 part 	 	from	the	human	,	the	machine	 ha 	 s 	 	 pass 	 ed 	 	the	test	.
i	now	 pro 	 pose 	 	a	test	for	computer	 voice 	 s 	 	--	the	ebert	test	.
if	a	computer	voice	can	 success 	 fully 	 	tell	a	joke	and	do	the	 tim 	 ing 	 	and	 deliver 	 y 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	henny	youngman	,	then	that	's	the	voice	i	want	.
