i	 decide 	 d 	 	when	i	was	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	that	what	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	talk	about	was	my	friend	richard	feynman	.
i	was	one	of	the	fortunate	few	that	 re 	 ally 	 	did	get	to	know	him	and	 enjoy 	 ed 	 	his	presence	.
and	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	the	richard	feynman	that	i	 k 	 new 	 	.
i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	there	are	other	people	here	who	could	tell	you	about	the	richard	feynman	they	 k 	 new 	 	,	and	it	would	 prob 	 ably 	 	be	a	different	richard	feynman	.
richard	feynman	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	complex	man	.
he	was	a	man	of	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 part 	 s 	 	.
he	was	,	of	course	,	 fore 	 most 	 	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	great	scientist	.
he	was	an	 a 	 ctor 	 	.	you	saw	him	act	.
i	 al 	 so 	 	had	the	good	fortune	to	be	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 lectur 	 es 	 	,	up	in	the	 balc 	 ony 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	fantastic	.
he	was	a	 philosoph 	 er 	 	;
he	was	a	drum	player	;
he	was	a	teacher	par	excellence	.
richard	feynman	was	 al 	 so 	 	a	 show 	 man 	 	,	an	enormous	 show 	 man 	 	.
he	was	 b 	 rash 	 	,	 ir 	 revere 	 nt 	 	--	he	was	full	of	 ma 	 cho 	 	,	a	kind	of	 ma 	 cho 	 	one	-	upmanship	.
he	 love 	 d 	 	intellectual	battle	.
he	had	a	 gar 	 gantuan 	 	ego	.
but	the	man	had	 some 	 how 	 	a	lot	of	room	at	the	bottom	.
and	what	i	mean	by	that	is	a	lot	of	room	,	in	my	case	--	i	ca	n't	speak	for	 any 	 body 	 	else	--	but	in	my	case	,	a	lot	of	room	for	 an 	 other 	 	big	ego	.
well	,	not	 a 	 s 	 	big	 a 	 s 	 	his	,	but	 fair 	 ly 	 	big	.
i	 al 	 ways 	 	felt	good	with	 d 	 ick 	 	feynman	.
it	was	 al 	 ways 	 	 f 	 un 	 	to	be	with	him	.
he	 al 	 ways 	 	made	me	feel	smart	.
how	can	 some 	 body 	 	like	that	make	you	feel	smart	?
 some 	 how 	 	he	did	.
he	made	me	feel	smart	.	he	made	me	feel	he	was	smart	.
he	made	me	feel	we	 we 	 re 	 	both	smart	,	and	the	two	of	us	could	solve	any	problem	 what 	 ever 	 	.
and	in	fact	,	we	did	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	do	physics	together	.
we	never	 publish 	 ed 	 	a	paper	together	,	but	we	did	have	a	lot	of	 f 	 un 	 	.
he	 love 	 d 	 	to	win	.
with	these	little	 ma 	 cho 	 	 game 	 s 	 	we	would	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	play	--	and	he	did	n't	 on 	 ly 	 	play	them	with	me	,	he	 play 	 ed 	 	them	with	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	people	--	he	would	 al 	 most 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	win	.
but	when	he	did	n't	win	,	when	he	lost	,	he	would	laugh	and	seem	to	have	just	 a 	 s 	 	much	 f 	 un 	 	 a 	 s 	 	if	he	had	won	.
i	remember	once	he	told	me	a	story	about	a	joke	that	the	 student 	 s 	 	 play 	 ed 	 	on	him	.
they	took	him	--	i	think	it	was	for	his	 birth 	 day 	 	--	they	took	him	for	lunch	.
they	took	him	for	lunch	to	a	sandwich	place	in	pasadena	.
it	may	still	exist	;	i	do	n't	know	.
 celebr 	 ity 	 	 sandwich 	 es 	 	was	 the 	 ir 	 	thing	.
you	could	get	a	marilyn	monroe	sandwich	.
you	could	get	a	humphrey	bogart	sandwich	.
the	 student 	 s 	 	went	there	in	advance	,	and	they	 arrange 	 d 	 	that	they	would	all	order	feynman	 sandwich 	 es 	 	.
one	after	 an 	 other 	 	,	they	came	in	and	 order 	 ed 	 	feynman	 sandwich 	 es 	 	.
feynman	 love 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	story	.
he	told	me	 th 	 is 	 	story	,	and	he	was	 re 	 ally 	 	happy	and	 laugh 	 ing 	 	.
when	he	 finish 	 ed 	 	the	story	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	to	him	,	``	 d 	 ick 	 	,	i	wonder	what	would	be	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	a	feynman	sandwich	and	a	susskind	sandwich	.	``	and	 with 	 out 	 	 skip 	 ping 	 	a	beat	at	all	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	they	'd	be	about	the	same	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 	is	a	susskind	sandwich	would	have	a	lot	more	ham	,	``	ham	,	 a 	 s 	 	in	bad	 a 	 ctor 	 	.
well	,	i	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	have	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	quick	that	day	,	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	,	but	a	lot	less	baloney	.	``	the	truth	of	the	matter	is	that	a	feynman	sandwich	had	a	load	of	ham	,	but	 absolute 	 ly 	 	no	baloney	.
what	feynman	 hat 	 ed 	 	 wo 	 rse 	 	than	 any 	 thing 	 	else	was	intellectual	 pre 	 tense 	 	--	 phon 	 iness 	 	,	false	 sophistic 	 ation 	 	,	 jar 	 gon 	 	.
i	remember	 some 	 time 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	'80s	,	the	mid	-	'80s	,	 d 	 ick 	 	and	i	and	sidney	coleman	would	meet	a	couple	of	 time 	 s 	 	up	in	san	francisco	at	some	 ver 	 y 	 	rich	guy	's	house	--	up	in	san	francisco	for	 d 	 inner 	 	.
and	the	last	time	the	rich	guy	 invit 	 ed 	 	us	,	he	 al 	 so 	 	 invit 	 ed 	 	a	couple	of	 philosoph 	 ers 	 	.
these	 guy 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 philosoph 	 ers 	 	of	mind	.
 the 	 ir 	 	 special 	 ty 	 	was	the	 philosoph 	 y 	 	of	 conscious 	 ness 	 	.
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	full	of	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 jar 	 gon 	 	.
i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	remember	the	 word 	 s 	 	--	``	 mon 	 ism 	 	,	``	``	 dual 	 ism 	 	,	``	 categor 	 ies 	 	all	over	the	place	.
i	did	n't	know	what	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	,	 n 	 either 	 	did	 d 	 ick 	 	--	 n 	 either 	 	did	sydney	for	that	matter	.
and	what	did	we	talk	about	?
well	,	what	do	you	talk	about	when	you	talk	about	 mind 	 s 	 	?
one	thing	,	there	's	one	obvious	thing	to	talk	about	--	can	a	machine	 be 	 come 	 	a	mind	?
can	you	build	a	machine	that	 think 	 s 	 	like	a	human	 be 	 ing 	 	,	that	is	conscious	?
we	 s 	 at 	 	around	and	we	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	--	we	of	course	never	resolved	it	.
but	the	trouble	with	the	 philosoph 	 ers 	 	is	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	 philosoph 	 izing 	 	when	they	should	have	 be 	 en 	 	science	-	iphizing	.
it	's	a	scientific	question	after	all	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	thing	to	do	around	 d 	 ick 	 	feynman	.
feynman	let	them	have	it	--	both	 barrel 	 s 	 	,	right	between	the	 eye 	 s 	 	.
it	was	brutal	;	it	was	funny	--	ooh	,	it	was	funny	.
but	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	brutal	.
he	 re 	 ally 	 	 pop 	 ped 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	balloon	.
but	the	 amaz 	 ing 	 	thing	was	--	feynman	had	to	 leav 	 e 	 	a	little	early	.
he	was	n't	 feel 	 ing 	 	too	well	,	so	he	left	a	little	bit	early	.
and	sidney	and	i	 we 	 re 	 	left	there	with	the	two	 philosoph 	 ers 	 	.
and	the	 amaz 	 ing 	 	thing	is	these	 guy 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 fly 	 ing 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	so	happy	.
they	had	met	the	great	man	;	they	had	 be 	 en 	 	 instruct 	 ed 	 	by	the	great	man	;	they	had	an	enormous	amount	of	 f 	 un 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 face 	 s 	 	 shove 	 d 	 	in	the	mud	,	and	it	was	 some 	 thing 	 	special	.
i	 real 	 ized 	 	there	was	 some 	 thing 	 	just	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	about	feynman	,	even	when	he	did	what	he	did	.
 d 	 ick 	 	,	he	was	my	friend	.	i	did	call	him	 d 	 ick 	 	.
 d 	 ick 	 	and	i	had	a	certain	,	a	little	bit	of	a	 rap 	 port 	 	.
i	think	it	may	have	 be 	 en 	 	a	special	 rap 	 port 	 	that	he	and	i	had	.
we	 like 	 d 	 	each	other	;	we	 like 	 d 	 	the	same	kind	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
i	 al 	 so 	 	 like 	 d 	 	the	kind	of	intellectual	 ma 	 cho 	 	 game 	 s 	 	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	i	would	win	,	 most 	 ly 	 	he	would	win	,	but	we	both	 enjoy 	 ed 	 	them	.
and	 d 	 ick 	 	 be 	 came 	 	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	at	some	point	that	he	and	i	had	some	kind	of	 similar 	 ity 	 	of	 personal 	 ity 	 	.
i	do	n't	think	he	was	right	.
i	think	the	 on 	 ly 	 	point	of	 similar 	 ity 	 	between	us	is	we	both	like	to	talk	about	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
but	he	was	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	he	was	 cur 	 ious 	 	.
the	man	was	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 cur 	 ious 	 	.
and	he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	understand	what	it	was	and	why	it	was	that	there	was	 th 	 is 	 	funny	 connect 	 ion 	 	.
and	one	day	we	 we 	 re 	 	 walk 	 ing 	 	.	we	 we 	 re 	 	in	france	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	in	la	zouche	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	up	in	the	 mountain 	 s 	 	,	1976	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	up	in	the	 mountain 	 s 	 	,	and	feynman	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	leonardo	.	``	the	reason	he	 call 	 ed 	 	me	leonardo	is	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	in	europe	and	he	was	 p 	 rac 	 tic 	 ing 	 	his	french	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	leonardo	,	 we 	 re 	 	you	 close 	 r 	 	to	your	mother	or	to	you	father	when	you	 we 	 re 	 	a	kid	?	``	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	my	real	hero	was	my	father	.
he	was	a	 work 	 ing 	 	man	,	had	a	fifth	grade	education	.
he	was	a	master	mechanic	,	and	he	taught	me	how	to	use	 tool 	 s 	 	.
he	taught	me	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	about	 mechanic 	 al 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
he	even	taught	me	the	pythagorean	 theor 	 em 	 	.
he	did	n't	call	it	the	 hypo 	 ten 	 use 	 	,	he	 call 	 ed 	 	it	the	 short 	 cut 	 	distance	.	``	and	feynman	's	 eye 	 s 	 	just	 open 	 ed 	 	up	.
he	went	off	like	a	light	bulb	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	he	had	had	 bas 	 ically 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	relationship	with	his	father	.
in	fact	,	he	had	 be 	 en 	 	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	at	one	time	that	,	to	be	a	good	physicist	,	that	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	have	had	that	kind	of	relationship	with	your	father	.
i	 apolog 	 ize 	 	for	the	 s 	 exist 	 	conversation	here	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	way	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	that	he	had	 be 	 en 	 	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	 necess 	 ary 	 	--	the	 necess 	 ary 	 	part	of	the	growing	up	of	a	young	physicist	.
 be 	 ing 	 	 d 	 ick 	 	,	he	,	of	course	,	 want 	 ed 	 	to	check	 th 	 is 	 	.
he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	go	out	and	do	an	experiment	.
so	,	well	he	did	.
he	went	out	and	did	an	experiment	.
he	 ask 	 ed 	 	all	his	 friend 	 s 	 	that	he	thought	 we 	 re 	 	good	 physicist 	 s 	 	,	``	was	it	your	mom	or	your	pop	that	 influence 	 d 	 	you	?	``	and	to	a	man	--	they	 we 	 re 	 	all	men	--	to	a	man	,	every	single	one	of	them	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	my	mother	.	``	there	went	that	 theor 	 y 	 	down	the	 trash 	 can 	 	of	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
but	he	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	that	he	had	 final 	 ly 	 	met	 some 	 body 	 	who	had	the	same	experience	with	my	father	 a 	 s 	 	he	had	with	his	father	.
and	for	some	time	,	he	was	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	reason	we	got	 a 	 long 	 	so	well	.
i	do	n't	know	.	 may 	 be 	 	.	who	 know 	 s 	 	?
but	let	me	tell	you	a	little	bit	about	feynman	the	physicist	.
feynman	's	style	--	no	,	style	is	not	the	right	word	.
style	 make 	 s 	 	you	think	of	the	bow	tie	he	might	have	worn	or	the	suit	he	was	 wear 	 ing 	 	.
there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	much	 deep 	 er 	 	than	that	,	but	i	ca	n't	think	of	 an 	 other 	 	word	for	it	.
feynman	's	scientific	style	was	 al 	 ways 	 	to	look	for	the	 simpl 	 est 	 	,	most	 element 	 ary 	 	solution	to	a	problem	that	was	possible	.
if	it	was	n't	possible	,	you	had	to	use	 some 	 thing 	 	 fanci 	 er 	 	.
but	no	doubt	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	was	his	great	joy	and	pleasure	in	 show 	 ing 	 	people	that	he	could	think	more	 simpl 	 y 	 	than	they	could	.
but	he	 al 	 so 	 	 deep 	 ly 	 	 believ 	 ed 	 	,	he	 tru 	 ly 	 	 believ 	 ed 	 	,	that	if	you	could	n't	explain	 some 	 thing 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	you	did	n't	understand	it	.
in	the	1950s	,	people	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	how	 super 	 fluid 	 	 hel 	 ium 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	.
there	was	a	 theor 	 y 	 	.
it	was	due	to	a	russian	 mathematic 	 al 	 	physicist	,	and	it	was	a	 complic 	 ated 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	.
i	'll	tell	you	what	that	 theor 	 y 	 	was	soon	 en 	 ough 	 	.
it	was	a	 terr 	 ibly 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	full	of	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	 integ 	 ral 	 s 	 	and	 formula 	 s 	 	and	 mathematic 	 s 	 	and	so	forth	.
and	it	sort	of	 work 	 ed 	 	,	but	it	did	n't	work	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	it	 work 	 ed 	 	is	when	the	 hel 	 ium 	 	 atom 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	far	 a 	 part 	 	.
the	 hel 	 ium 	 	 atom 	 s 	 	had	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	far	 a 	 part 	 	.
and	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	the	 hel 	 ium 	 	 atom 	 s 	 	in	liquid	 hel 	 ium 	 	are	right	on	top	of	each	other	.
feynman	 decide 	 d 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	sort	of	amateur	 hel 	 ium 	 	physicist	,	that	he	would	try	to	figure	it	out	.
he	had	an	idea	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	idea	.
he	would	try	to	figure	out	what	the	 quant 	 um 	 	wave	function	of	 th 	 is 	 	huge	number	of	 atom 	 s 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	like	.
he	would	try	to	 visual 	 ize 	 	it	,	 guide 	 d 	 	by	a	small	number	of	simple	 principle 	 s 	 	.
the	small	number	of	simple	 principle 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	.
the	first	one	was	that	when	 hel 	 ium 	 	 atom 	 s 	 	touch	each	other	,	they	repel	.
the	 implic 	 ation 	 	of	that	is	that	the	wave	function	 ha 	 s 	 	to	go	to	zero	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	vanish	when	the	 hel 	 ium 	 	 atom 	 s 	 	touch	each	other	.
the	other	fact	is	that	the	ground	state	,	the	 low 	 est 	 	energy	state	of	a	 quant 	 um 	 	system	,	the	wave	function	is	 al 	 ways 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	smooth	--	 ha 	 s 	 	the	 minim 	 um 	 	number	of	 wig 	 gle 	 s 	 	.
so	he	 s 	 at 	 	down	--	and	i	imagine	he	had	 noth 	 ing 	 	more	than	a	simple	piece	of	paper	and	a	pencil	--	and	he	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	write	down	,	and	did	write	down	,	the	 simpl 	 est 	 	function	that	he	could	think	of	which	had	the	 bound 	 ary 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	that	the	wave	function	vanish	when	 thing 	 s 	 	touch	and	is	smooth	in	between	.
he	wrote	down	a	simple	thing	.
it	was	so	simple	,	in	fact	,	that	i	suspect	a	 re 	 ally 	 	smart	high	school	student	,	who	did	n't	even	have	 calcul 	 us 	 	,	could	understand	what	he	wrote	down	.
the	thing	was	that	that	simple	thing	that	he	wrote	down	 explain 	 ed 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	that	was	known	at	the	time	about	liquid	 hel 	 ium 	 	and	then	some	.
i	've	 al 	 ways 	 	 wonder 	 ed 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	the	 professional 	 s 	 	,	the	real	professional	 hel 	 ium 	 	 physicist 	 s 	 	,	 we 	 re 	 	just	a	little	bit	 embarrass 	 ed 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	.
they	had	 the 	 ir 	 	super	-	 power 	 ful 	 	 techni 	 que 	 	,	and	they	could	n't	do	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
 incident 	 ally 	 	,	i	'll	tell	you	what	that	super	-	 power 	 ful 	 	 techni 	 que 	 	was	.
it	was	the	 techni 	 que 	 	of	feynman	 dia 	 gram 	 s 	 	.
he	did	it	 aga 	 in 	 	in	1968	.
in	1968	,	in	my	own	university	--	i	was	n't	there	at	the	time	--	but	in	1968	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	the	structure	of	the	proton	.
the	proton	is	 obvious 	 ly 	 	made	of	a	whole	bunch	of	little	 particle 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	more	or	less	known	.
and	the	way	to	 analyz 	 e 	 	it	was	,	of	course	,	feynman	 dia 	 gram 	 s 	 	.
that	's	what	feynman	 dia 	 gram 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 construct 	 ed 	 	for	--	to	understand	 particle 	 s 	 	.
the	 experiment 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	going	on	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	.
you	 simpl 	 y 	 	take	the	proton	,	and	you	hit	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 sharp 	 ly 	 	with	an	electron	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	the	thing	the	feynman	 dia 	 gram 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	for	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	problem	was	that	feynman	 dia 	 gram 	 s 	 	are	 complic 	 ated 	 	.
they	're	difficult	 integ 	 ral 	 s 	 	.
if	you	could	do	all	of	them	,	you	would	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	precise	 theor 	 y 	 	.
but	you	could	n't	;	they	 we 	 re 	 	just	too	 complic 	 ated 	 	.
people	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	them	.
you	could	do	a	one	loop	 dia 	 gram 	 	.	do	n't	worry	about	one	loop	.
one	loop	,	two	 loop 	 s 	 	--	 may 	 be 	 	you	could	do	a	three	loop	 dia 	 gram 	 	,	but	beyond	that	,	you	could	n't	do	 any 	 thing 	 	.
feynman	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	forget	all	of	that	.
just	think	of	the	proton	 a 	 s 	 	an	 assem 	 bl 	 age 	 	of	little	 particle 	 s 	 	--	a	 s 	 warm 	 	of	little	 particle 	 s 	 	.	``	he	 call 	 ed 	 	them	 part 	 on 	 s 	 	.	he	 call 	 ed 	 	them	 part 	 on 	 s 	 	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	just	think	of	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	 s 	 warm 	 	of	 part 	 on 	 s 	 	moving	real	fast	.	``	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	moving	real	fast	,	 relat 	 ivity 	 	 say 	 s 	 	the	internal	 motion 	 s 	 	go	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 low 	 	.
the	electron	 hit 	 s 	 	it	 sudden 	 ly 	 	.
it	's	like	taking	a	 ver 	 y 	 	sudden	 snap 	 shot 	 	of	the	proton	.
what	do	you	see	?
you	see	a	 froze 	 n 	 	bunch	of	 part 	 on 	 s 	 	.
they	do	n't	move	,	and	 be 	 cause 	 	they	do	n't	move	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	course	of	the	experiment	,	you	do	n't	have	to	worry	about	how	they	're	moving	.
you	do	n't	have	to	worry	about	the	 force 	 s 	 	between	them	.
you	just	get	to	think	of	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	population	of	 froze 	 n 	 	 part 	 on 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	the	key	to	 analyz 	 ing 	 	these	 experiment 	 s 	 	.
 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	effective	,	it	 re 	 ally 	 	did	--	 some 	 body 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	the	word	revolution	is	a	bad	word	.
i	suppose	it	is	,	so	i	wo	n't	say	revolution	--	but	it	 certain 	 ly 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 deep 	 ly 	 	our	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	the	proton	,	and	of	 particle 	 s 	 	beyond	that	.
well	,	i	had	some	more	that	i	was	going	to	tell	you	about	my	 connect 	 ion 	 	with	feynman	,	what	he	was	like	,	but	i	see	i	have	 exact 	 ly 	 	half	a	minute	.
so	i	think	i	'll	just	finish	up	by	 say 	 ing 	 	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	n't	think	feynman	would	have	 like 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	event	.
i	think	he	would	have	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	do	n't	need	 th 	 is 	 	.	``	but	how	should	we	honor	feynman	?
how	should	we	 re 	 ally 	 	honor	feynman	?
i	think	the	answer	is	we	should	honor	feynman	by	 get 	 ting 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	baloney	out	of	our	own	 sandwich 	 es 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	can	.
thank	you	.
