i	think	the	future	of	 th 	 is 	 	planet	 depend 	 s 	 	on	 human 	 s 	 	,	not	technology	,	and	we	 al 	 ready 	 	have	the	knowledge	--
we	're	kind	of	at	the	 end 	 game 	 	with	knowledge	.	but	we	're	 no 	 where 	 	near	the	 end 	 game 	 	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	our	 per 	 ception 	 	.
we	still	have	one	foot	in	the	dark	 age 	 s 	 	.
and	when	you	listen	to	some	of	the	 present 	 ations 	 	here	--	and	the	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	range	of	human	 cap 	 ability 	 	,	our	 understand 	 ing 	 s 	 	--	and	then	you	contrast	it	with	the	fact	we	still	call	 th 	 is 	 	planet	,	``	earth	:	``	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	--
we	have	one	foot	in	the	dark	 age 	 s 	 	.
just	 quick 	 ly 	 	:	aristotle	,	his	thing	was	,	``	it	's	not	flat	,	stupid	,	it	's	round	.	``
galileo	--	he	had	the	inquisition	,	so	he	had	to	be	a	little	bit	more	polite	--
his	was	,	``	it	's	not	in	the	middle	,	you	know	.	``
and	hawkes	:	``	it	's	not	earth	,	stupid	,	it	's	ocean	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	ocean	planet	.
t.s	.	eliot	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	it	for	me	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	should	give	you	goose	 bump 	 s 	 	:	``	we	 s 	 hall 	 	not	cease	from	exploration	and	the	end	of	our	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	 s 	 hall 	 	be	to	return	where	we	 start 	 ed 	 	and	know	the	place	for	the	first	time	.	``
and	the	next	lines	are	,	``	through	the	 un 	 known 	 	 remember 	 ed 	 	gate	,	where	the	last	of	earth	 discover 	 ed 	 	is	that	which	is	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	.	``
so	i	have	one	 mess 	 age 	 	.
it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	that	we	're	all	 point 	 ed 	 	in	the	wrong	direction	.
for	the	 rocket 	 e 	 ers 	 	in	the	audience	:	i	love	what	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	,	i	admire	the	 gut 	 s 	 	,	i	admire	the	courage	--	but	your	 rocket 	 s 	 	are	 point 	 ed 	 	in	the	wrong	 god 	 damn 	 	direction	.
and	it	's	all	a	question	of	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	.
let	me	try	and	tell	you	--
i	do	n't	mean	to	insult	you	,	but	look	,	if	i	--	and	i	'm	not	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	for	real	 be 	 cause 	 	it	would	be	an	insult	,	so	i	'm	going	to	pretend	,	and	it	 s 	 often 	 s 	 	the	blow	--
i	'm	going	to	tell	you	what	you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	.
if	i	held	up	a	square	that	was	one	foot	square	and	the	color	of	earth	,	and	i	held	up	 an 	 other 	 	square	that	was	the	root	two	square	--	so	it	's	1.5	 time 	 s 	 	 big 	 ger 	 	--	and	was	the	color	of	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	;	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	what	is	the	 relat 	 ive 	 	value	of	these	two	 thing 	 s 	 	?
well	,	it	's	the	 relat 	 ive 	 	 import 	 ance 	 	.
you	would	say	--	 yea 	 h 	 	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	we	all	know	 th 	 is 	 	;
water	 cover 	 s 	 	twice	the	area	of	the	planet	than	dry	land	.
but	it	's	a	question	of	 per 	 ception 	 	,
and	if	that	's	what	you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	,	if	that	's	what	you	think	i	mean	when	i	say	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	ocean	planet	 stupid 	 ly 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	'	earth	.	'	``
if	you	think	that	that	's	the	 relat 	 ive 	 	 import 	 ance 	 	,	two	to	one	,	you	're	wrong	by	a	factor	of	ten	.
now	,	you	're	not	 a 	 s 	 	thick	 a 	 s 	 	two	short	 plank 	 s 	 	,	but	you	sound	like	it	when	you	say	``	earth	,	``	 be 	 cause 	 	that	 demonst 	 ration 	 	,	if	i	 turn 	 ed 	 	around	 th 	 is 	 	way	--	that	earth	plane	would	be	 a 	 s 	 	thin	 a 	 s 	 	paper	.
it	's	a	thin	film	,	two	-	dimensional	 exist 	 ence 	 	.
the	ocean	 represent 	 ation 	 	would	have	a	depth	to	it	.
and	if	you	 heft 	 ed 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 thing 	 s 	 	you	might	find	that	the	 relat 	 ive 	 	scale	of	 t 	 hose 	 	is	20	to	1	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	 some 	 thing 	 	more	than	94	percent	of	life	on	earth	is	 aqua 	 tic 	 	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	us	 terrestrial 	 s 	 	occupy	a	 minor 	 ity 	 	.
the	problem	we	have	in	 believ 	 ing 	 	that	is	--	you	just	have	to	give	up	 th 	 is 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	earth	was	 create 	 d 	 	for	us	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	a	problem	we	have	.
if	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	ocean	planet	and	we	 on 	 ly 	 	have	a	small	 minor 	 ity 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	planet	,	it	just	 interfere 	 s 	 	with	a	lot	of	what	 human 	 ity 	 	 think 	 s 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	let	me	 critic 	 ize 	 	 th 	 is 	 	thing	.
i	'm	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	james	cameron	--	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	i	could	,	but	i	wo	n't	.
you	 re 	 ally 	 	do	have	to	go	and	see	his	 lat 	 est 	 	film	,	``	 alien 	 s 	 	of	the	deep	.	``	it	's	 in 	 credible 	 	.
it	 feature 	 s 	 	two	of	these	deep	 r 	 over 	 s 	 	,	and	i	can	 critic 	 ize 	 	them	 be 	 cause 	 	these	sweet	 thing 	 s 	 	are	mine	.
 th 	 is 	 	,	i	think	,	 represent 	 s 	 	one	of	the	most	 beaut 	 iful 	 	classic	 submersible 	 s 	 	built	.
if	you	look	at	that	sub	,	you	'll	see	a	sphere	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	acryclic	sphere	.
it	 generate 	 s 	 	all	of	the	 buoy 	 ancy 	 	,	all	of	the	 pay 	 load 	 	for	the	craft	,	and	the	 batt 	 eries 	 	are	down	here	 hang 	 ing 	 	 under 	 neath 	 	,	 exact 	 ly 	 	like	a	balloon	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 envelop 	 e 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	gondola	,	the	 pay 	 load 	 	.
 al 	 so 	 	coming	up	 lat 	 er 	 	for	 critic 	 ism 	 	are	these	massive	 light 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	one	 actual 	 ly 	 	 car 	 ries 	 	two	great	 manipul 	 ators 	 	.
it	 actual 	 ly 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 work 	 ing 	 	sub	--	that	's	what	it	was	designed	for	.
the	problem	with	it	is	--	and	the	reason	i	will	never	build	 an 	 other 	 	one	like	it	--	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	product	of	two	-	dimensional	 think 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	what	we	 human 	 s 	 	do	when	we	go	in	the	ocean	 a 	 s 	 	 engineer 	 s 	 	;
we	take	all	our	terrestrial	hang	-	 up 	 s 	 	,	all	our	 constraint 	 s 	 	--	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	these	two	-	dimensional	 constraint 	 s 	 	that	we	have	,	and	they	're	so	 con 	 s 	 trained 	 	we	do	n't	even	understand	it	--	and	we	take	them	 under 	 water 	 	.
you	notice	that	jim	cameron	is	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	a	seat	.
a	seat	 work 	 s 	 	in	a	two	-	dimensional	world	,	where	 gravit 	 y 	 	 blast 	 s 	 	down	on	that	seat	,	ok	?
and	in	a	two	-	dimensional	world	,	we	do	know	about	the	third	dimension	but	we	do	n't	use	it	 be 	 cause 	 	to	go	up	 requir 	 es 	 	an	awful	lot	of	energy	against	 gravit 	 y 	 	.
and	then	our	 mother 	 s 	 	tell	us	,	``	 care 	 ful 	 	you	do	n't	fall	down	``	--	 be 	 cause 	 	you	'll	fall	over	.
now	,	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	real	atmosphere	of	 th 	 is 	 	planet	.
 th 	 is 	 	planet	 ha 	 s 	 	an	inner	atmosphere	of	water	;
it	's	 it 	 s 	 	inner	atmosphere	.	it	 ha 	 s 	 	two	 atmosphere 	 s 	 	--
a	 less 	 er 	 	,	 out 	 er 	 	 gas 	 eous 	 	atmosphere	,	a	 light 	 er 	 	one	.
most	of	life	on	earth	is	in	that	inner	atmosphere	.
and	that	life	 enjoy 	 s 	 	a	three	-	dimensional	 exist 	 ence 	 	,	which	is	alien	to	us	.
fish	do	not	 s 	 it 	 	in	 seat 	 s 	 	.
they	do	n't	.	 the 	 ir 	 	 mother 	 s 	 	do	n't	say	to	little	baby	fish	,	``	 care 	 ful 	 	you	do	n't	fall	over	.	``
they	do	n't	fall	over	.	they	do	n't	fall	.
they	live	in	a	three	-	dimensional	world	where	there	is	no	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	energy	between	going	 th 	 is 	 	way	,	that	way	,	that	way	or	that	way	.
it	's	 tru 	 ly 	 	a	three	-	dimensional	space	.
and	we	're	 on 	 ly 	 	just	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	grasp	it	.
i	do	n't	know	of	any	other	submersible	,	or	even	remote	,	that	just	 take 	 s 	 	advantage	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	three	-	dimensional	space	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	way	we	should	be	going	 in 	 to 	 	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	three	-	dimensional	machine	.
what	we	need	to	do	is	go	down	 in 	 to 	 	the	ocean	with	the	 free 	 dom 	 	of	the	 animal 	 s 	 	,	and	move	in	 th 	 is 	 	three	-	dimensional	space	.
ok	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	good	stuff	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	man	's	first	attempt	at	 fly 	 ing 	 	 under 	 water 	 	.
right	now	,	i	'm	just	coming	down	on	 th 	 is 	 	 gorge 	 ous 	 	,	big	,	giant	 man 	 ta 	 	ray	.
she	 ha 	 s 	 	twice	the	 wing 	 span 	 	that	i	do	.
there	i	'm	coming	;	she	 s 	 ees 	 	me	.
and	just	notice	how	she	 roll 	 s 	 	under	and	 turn 	 s 	 	;
she	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 s 	 it 	 	there	and	try	and	blow	air	 in 	 to 	 	a	tank	and	kind	of	flow	up	or	sink	down	--	she	just	 roll 	 s 	 	.
and	the	craft	that	i	'm	in	--	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 be 	 en 	 	 show 	 n 	 	before	.
chris	 ask 	 ed 	 	us	to	show	stuff	that	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 be 	 en 	 	 show 	 n 	 	before	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	you	to	notice	that	she	 actual 	 ly 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	to	come	back	up	.
there	i	am	;	i	see	her	coming	back	,	coming	up	 under 	 neath 	 	me	.
i	put	reverse	thrust	and	i	try	and	pull	 gent 	 ly 	 	down	.
i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	 every 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 gent 	 ly 	 	.
we	 s 	 pent 	 	about	three	 hour 	 s 	 	together	and	she	's	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	trust	me	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	ballet	is	controlled	by	 th 	 is 	 	 lad 	 y 	 	here	.
she	 get 	 s 	 	about	that	close	and	then	she	 pull 	 s 	 	away	.
so	now	i	try	and	go	after	her	,	but	i	'm	 p 	 rac 	 tic 	 ing 	 	 fly 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	 fly 	 ing 	 	machine	.	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	first	prototype	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	fly	by	wire	.	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 wing 	 s 	 	.
there	're	no	 s 	 il 	 ly 	 	 buoy 	 ancy 	 	 tank 	 s 	 	--	it	's	 permanent 	 ly 	 	,	 positive 	 ly 	 	 buoy 	 ant 	 	.
and	then	by	moving	through	the	water	it	's	able	to	take	that	control	.
now	,	look	at	that	;	look	,	it	's	--	she	just	 ble 	 w 	 	me	away	.
she	just	 roll 	 ed 	 	right	away	from	 under 	 neath 	 	.	 re 	 ally 	 	that	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	real	 d 	 ive 	 	i	've	ever	made	in	 th 	 is 	 	machine	.
it	took	10	 year 	 s 	 	to	build	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	 lad 	 y 	 	here	taught	me	,	hah	,	taught	me	so	much	.
we	just	 learn 	 ed 	 	so	much	in	three	 hour 	 s 	 	in	the	water	there	.
i	just	had	to	go	and	build	 an 	 other 	 	machine	.
but	look	here	.	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 blow 	 ing 	 	 tank 	 s 	 	and	coming	up	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	it	,	it	's	a	little	bit	of	back	pressure	,	and	that	sub	just	 come 	 s 	 	straight	back	up	out	of	the	water	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	internal	sony	camera	.	thank	you	,	sony	.
i	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	look	that	 ug 	 ly 	 	,	but	the	camera	is	so	close	that	it	's	just	 distort 	 ed 	 	.
now	,	there	she	 go 	 es 	 	,	right	 over 	 head 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	wide	-	angle	camera	.
she	's	just	a	few	 inch 	 es 	 	off	the	top	of	my	head	.
``	aah	,	ha	,	oh	,	he	just	 cross 	 ed 	 	over	the	top	of	my	head	about	,	oh	,	i	do	n't	know	,	just	so	close	.	``	i	come	back	up	,	not	for	air	.
``	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 in 	 credible 	 	 en 	 counter 	 	with	a	 man 	 ta 	 	.	i	'm	 speech 	 less 	 	.
we	've	 be 	 en 	 	just	feet	 a 	 part 	 	.	i	'm	going	back	down	now	.	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	can	we	cut	that	?	 light 	 s 	 	back	up	 pleas 	 e 	 	.
 try 	 ing 	 	to	fly	and	keep	up	with	that	animal	--	it	was	n't	the	lack	of	 maneuver 	 ability 	 	that	we	had	.	it	was	the	fact	she	was	going	so	 s 	 low 	 	.
i	 actual 	 ly 	 	designed	that	to	move	 fast 	 er 	 	through	the	water
 be 	 cause 	 	i	thought	that	was	the	thing	that	we	 need 	 ed 	 	to	do	:	to	move	fast	and	get	range	.
but	after	that	 en 	 counter 	 	i	 re 	 ally 	 	did	want	to	go	back	with	that	animal	and	dance	.
she	 want 	 ed 	 	to	dance	.
and	so	what	we	 need 	 ed 	 	to	do	was	 in 	 crease 	 	the	wing	area	so	that	we	just	had	more	grip	,	develop	 high 	 er 	 	 force 	 s 	 	.
so	the	sub	that	was	 out 	 side 	 	last	year	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	one	.
you	see	the	 large 	 r 	 	wing	area	here	.
 al 	 so 	 	,	 clear 	 ly 	 	,	it	was	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 power 	 ful 	 	thing	,	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	try	and	 br 	 ing 	 	other	people	but	we	could	n't	figure	out	how	to	do	it	.
so	we	 open 	 ed 	 	the	world	's	first	flight	school	.
the	rational	for	the	world	's	first	flight	school	 go 	 es 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	:	when	the	 coast 	 guard 	 s 	 	come	up	to	me	and	say	--	they	used	to	 leav 	 e 	 	us	 al 	 one 	 	when	we	 we 	 re 	 	 div 	 ing 	 	these	 goof 	 y 	 	little	 spheric 	 al 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,
but	when	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 fly 	 ing 	 	around	in	 under 	 water 	 	jet	 fight 	 ers 	 	they	got	a	little	nervous	--
they	would	come	up	and	say	,	``	do	you	have	a	 licens 	 e 	 	for	that	?	``
and	then	i	'd	put	my	 s 	 un 	 glass 	 es 	 	on	,	the	beard	that	would	all	sprout	out	,	and	i	would	say	,	``	i	do	n't	need	no	 stink 	 ing 	 	 licens 	 e 	 	.	``
``	i	write	these	 stink 	 ing 	 	 licens 	 e 	 	,	``	which	i	do	.
so	bob	gelfond	's	around	here	--	but	 some 	 body 	 	in	the	audience	here	 ha 	 s 	 	 licens 	 e 	 	number	20	.
they	're	one	of	the	first	 sub 	 sea 	 	 a 	 vi 	 ators 	 	.
so	we	've	run	two	flight	 school 	 s 	 	.
where	the	hell	that	 go 	 es 	 	,	i	do	n't	know	,	but	it	's	a	lot	of	 f 	 un 	 	.
what	 come 	 s 	 	next	in	30	 second 	 s 	 	?	i	ca	n't	tell	you	.
but	the	patent	for	 under 	 water 	 	flight	--	karen	and	i	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	looking	at	it	,
some	business	 partner 	 s 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	us	to	patent	it	--
we	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 s 	 ure 	 	about	that	.
we	've	 decide 	 d 	 	we	're	just	going	to	let	that	go	.
it	just	 seem 	 s 	 	wrong	to	try	and	patent	--	--	the	 free 	 dom 	 	for	 under 	 water 	 	flight	.
so	 any 	 body 	 	who	 want 	 s 	 	to	copy	us	and	come	and	join	us	,	go	for	it	.
the	other	thing	is	that	we	've	got	much	lower	 cost 	 s 	 	.
we	 develop 	 ed 	 	some	other	technology	 call 	 ed 	 	spider	 optic 	 s 	 	,	and	craig	ventner	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	to	make	an	 announce 	 ment 	 	here	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	:
we	're	going	to	be	building	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	little	,	small	version	of	 th 	 is 	 	--	 un 	 mann 	 ed 	 	,	super	deep	--	for	his	boat	to	go	and	get	back	some	deep	sea	dna	stuff	.
thank	you	.
