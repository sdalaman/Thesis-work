there	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	major	health	crisis	 to 	 day 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	 short 	 age 	 	of	 organ 	 s 	 	.	the	fact	is	that	we	're	living	 long 	 er 	 	.
medicine	 ha 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	a	much	better	job	of	making	us	live	 long 	 er 	 	,	and	the	problem	is	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	age	,	our	 organ 	 s 	 	tend	to	fail	more	,
and	so	 current 	 ly 	 	there	are	not	 en 	 ough 	 	 organ 	 s 	 	to	go	around	.
in	fact	,	in	the	last	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	number	of	 patient 	 s 	 	 requir 	 ing 	 	an	organ	 ha 	 s 	 	 double 	 d 	 	,	while	in	the	same	time	,	the	actual	number	of	 transplant 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 bare 	 ly 	 	gone	up	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	now	a	public	health	crisis	.
so	that	's	where	 th 	 is 	 	field	 come 	 s 	 	in	that	we	call	the	field	of	 re 	 generative 	 	medicine	.
it	 re 	 ally 	 	 involve 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	different	 area 	 s 	 	.
you	can	use	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 scaffold 	 s 	 	,	 bio 	 material 	 s 	 	--	they	're	like	the	piece	of	your	 bl 	 ous 	 e 	 	or	your	shirt	--	but	specific	 material 	 s 	 	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	implant	in	 patient 	 s 	 	and	they	will	do	well	and	help	you	 re 	 generate 	 	.
or	we	can	use	 cell 	 s 	 	 al 	 one 	 	,	either	your	 ver 	 y 	 	own	 cell 	 s 	 	or	different	stem	cell	 population 	 s 	 	.
or	we	can	use	both	.	we	can	use	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 bio 	 material 	 s 	 	and	the	 cell 	 s 	 	together	.	and	that	's	where	the	field	is	 to 	 day 	 	.
but	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	not	a	new	field	.
 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	book	that	was	 publish 	 ed 	 	back	in	1938	.
it	's	titled	``	the	culture	of	 organ 	 s 	 	.	``
the	first	author	,	alexis	carrel	,	a	 no 	 bel 	 	prize	winner	.	he	 actual 	 ly 	 	 de 	 vis 	 ed 	 	some	of	the	same	 techno 	 logies 	 	used	 to 	 day 	 	for	 sutur 	 ing 	 	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	,
and	some	of	the	blood	vessel	 graft 	 s 	 	we	use	 to 	 day 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	designed	by	alexis	.
but	i	want	you	to	note	his	co	-	author	:	charles	lindbergh	.
that	's	the	same	charles	lindbergh	who	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 pent 	 	the	rest	of	his	life	 work 	 ing 	 	with	alexis	at	the	rockefeller	institute	in	new	york	in	the	area	of	the	culture	of	 organ 	 s 	 	.
so	if	the	field	's	 be 	 en 	 	around	for	so	long	,	why	so	few	 clinic 	 al 	 	 advance 	 s 	 	?
and	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	to	 man 	 y 	 	different	 challeng 	 es 	 	.
but	if	i	 we 	 re 	 	to	point	to	three	 challeng 	 es 	 	,	the	first	one	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	design	of	 material 	 s 	 	that	could	go	in	your	body	and	do	well	over	time	.
and	 man 	 y 	 	 advance 	 s 	 	now	,	we	can	do	that	 fair 	 ly 	 	 read 	 ily 	 	.
the	second	 challeng 	 e 	 	was	 cell 	 s 	 	.
we	could	not	get	 en 	 ough 	 	of	your	 cell 	 s 	 	to	grow	 out 	 side 	 	of	your	body	.
over	the	last	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	've	 bas 	 ically 	 	 tackle 	 d 	 	that	.
 man 	 y 	 	 scientist 	 s 	 	can	now	grow	 man 	 y 	 	different	 type 	 s 	 	of	 cell 	 s 	 	.	plus	we	have	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	.
but	even	now	,	2011	,	there	's	still	certain	 cell 	 s 	 	that	we	just	ca	n't	grow	from	the	patient	.
liver	 cell 	 s 	 	,	nerve	 cell 	 s 	 	,	 pan 	 cre 	 atic 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	--	we	still	ca	n't	grow	them	even	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	the	third	 challeng 	 e 	 	is	 vascular 	 ity 	 	,	the	actual	supply	of	blood	to	allow	 t 	 hose 	 	 organ 	 s 	 	or	 tissue 	 s 	 	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	once	we	 re 	 generate 	 	them	.
so	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	use	 bio 	 material 	 s 	 	now	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 bio 	 material 	 	.
we	can	weave	them	,	knit	them	,	or	we	can	make	them	like	you	see	here	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	like	a	cotton	 can 	 dy 	 	machine	.
you	saw	the	spray	going	in	.	that	was	like	the	 fiber 	 s 	 	of	the	cotton	 can 	 dy 	 	creating	 th 	 is 	 	structure	,	 th 	 is 	 	 tub 	 ular 	 ized 	 	structure	,	which	is	a	 bio 	 material 	 	that	we	can	then	use	to	help	your	body	 re 	 generate 	 	using	your	 ver 	 y 	 	own	 cell 	 s 	 	to	do	so	.
and	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	we	did	here	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	patient	who	[	was	]	 present 	 ed 	 	with	a	 de 	 cease 	 d 	 	organ	,	and	we	then	 create 	 d 	 	one	of	these	smart	 bio 	 material 	 s 	 	,	and	then	we	then	used	that	smart	 bio 	 material 	 	to	replace	and	repair	that	patient	's	structure	.
what	we	did	was	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	used	the	 bio 	 material 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	bridge	so	that	the	 cell 	 s 	 	in	the	organ	could	walk	on	that	bridge	,	if	you	will	,	and	help	to	bridge	the	gap	to	 re 	 generate 	 	that	tissue	.
and	you	see	that	patient	now	six	 month 	 s 	 	after	with	an	x	-	ray	 show 	 ing 	 	you	the	 re 	 generated 	 	tissue	,	which	is	fully	 re 	 generated 	 	when	you	 analyz 	 e 	 	it	under	the	 micro 	 scope 	 	.
we	can	 al 	 so 	 	use	 cell 	 s 	 	 al 	 one 	 	.	these	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	that	we	 obtain 	 ed 	 	.
these	are	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	that	we	create	from	specific	 source 	 s 	 	,	and	we	can	drive	them	to	 be 	 come 	 	heart	 cell 	 s 	 	,
and	they	start	 beat 	 ing 	 	in	culture	.
so	they	know	what	to	do	.	the	 cell 	 s 	 	 genetic 	 ally 	 	know	what	to	do	,	and	they	start	 beat 	 ing 	 	together	.
now	 to 	 day 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 clinic 	 al 	 	 trial 	 s 	 	are	using	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	for	heart	disease	.
so	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	now	in	 patient 	 s 	 	.
or	if	we	're	going	to	use	 large 	 r 	 	 structure 	 s 	 	to	replace	 large 	 r 	 	 structure 	 s 	 	,	we	can	then	use	the	patient	's	own	 cell 	 s 	 	,	or	some	cell	population	,	and	the	 bio 	 material 	 s 	 	,	the	 scaffold 	 s 	 	,	together	.
so	the	 con 	 cept 	 	here	:	so	if	you	do	have	a	 de 	 cease 	 d 	 	or	 inju 	 red 	 	organ	,	we	take	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	piece	of	that	tissue	,	less	than	half	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	 post 	 age 	 	stamp	.
we	then	 teas 	 e 	 	the	 cell 	 s 	 	 a 	 part 	 	,	we	grow	the	 cell 	 s 	 	 out 	 side 	 	the	body	.
we	then	take	a	scaffold	,	a	 bio 	 material 	 	--	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 look 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	like	a	piece	of	your	 bl 	 ous 	 e 	 	or	your	shirt	--
we	then	shape	that	material	,	and	we	then	use	 t 	 hose 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	to	coat	that	material	one	layer	at	a	time	--	 ver 	 y 	 	much	like	 ba 	 king 	 	a	layer	cake	,	if	you	will	.
we	then	place	it	in	an	oven	-	like	 de 	 vice 	 	,	and	we	're	able	to	create	that	structure	and	 br 	 ing 	 	it	out	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	heart	 val 	 ve 	 	that	we	've	engineered	,
and	you	can	see	here	,	we	have	the	structure	of	the	heart	 val 	 ve 	 	and	we	've	 seed 	 ed 	 	that	with	 cell 	 s 	 	,	and	then	we	 exercis 	 e 	 	it	.
so	you	see	the	 leaf 	 lets 	 	 open 	 ing 	 	and	 clo 	 s 	 ing 	 	--	of	 th 	 is 	 	heart	 val 	 ve 	 	that	's	 current 	 ly 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	used	 experiment 	 ally 	 	to	try	to	get	it	to	further	 stud 	 ies 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	technology	that	we	have	used	in	 patient 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 involve 	 s 	 	 bladder 	 s 	 	.
we	 actual 	 ly 	 	take	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	piece	of	the	bladder	from	the	patient	--	less	than	half	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	 post 	 age 	 	stamp	.
we	then	grow	the	 cell 	 s 	 	 out 	 side 	 	the	body	,	take	the	scaffold	,	coat	the	scaffold	with	the	 cell 	 s 	 	--	the	patient	's	own	 cell 	 s 	 	,	two	different	cell	 type 	 s 	 	.
we	then	put	it	in	 th 	 is 	 	oven	-	like	 de 	 vice 	 	.	it	 ha 	 s 	 	the	same	 condition 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	human	body	--	37	 degree 	 s 	 	 cent 	 i 	 grade 	 	,	95	percent	oxygen	.	a	few	 week 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	you	have	your	engineered	organ	that	we	're	able	to	implant	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	patient	.	for	these	specific	 patient 	 s 	 	,	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	just	 sutur 	 e 	 	these	 material 	 s 	 	.
we	use	three	-	dimensional	 imagin 	 ing 	 	analysis	,	but	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 create 	 d 	 	these	 bio 	 material 	 s 	 	by	hand	.
but	we	now	have	better	ways	to	create	these	 structure 	 s 	 	with	the	 cell 	 s 	 	.
we	use	now	some	type	of	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	where	for	solid	 organ 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	like	the	liver	,
what	we	do	is	we	take	 dis 	 card 	 	 liver 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	know	,	a	lot	of	 organ 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 dis 	 card 	 ed 	 	,	not	used	.
so	we	can	take	these	liver	 structure 	 s 	 	,	which	are	not	going	to	be	used	,	and	we	then	put	them	in	a	 wash 	 ing 	 	machine	-	like	structure	that	will	allow	the	 cell 	 s 	 	to	be	 wash 	 ed 	 	away	.
two	 week 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	you	have	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	liver	.
you	can	hold	it	like	a	liver	,	but	it	 ha 	 s 	 	no	 cell 	 s 	 	;	it	's	just	a	skeleton	of	the	liver	.
and	we	then	can	re	-	 per 	 fuse 	 	the	liver	with	 cell 	 s 	 	,	 pre 	 serv 	 ing 	 	the	blood	vessel	tree	.
so	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 per 	 fuse 	 	first	the	blood	vessel	tree	with	the	patient	's	own	blood	vessel	 cell 	 s 	 	,	and	we	then	 infilt 	 rate 	 	the	 par 	 enchyma 	 	with	the	liver	 cell 	 s 	 	.
and	we	now	have	 be 	 en 	 	able	just	to	show	the	creation	of	human	liver	tissue	just	 th 	 is 	 	past	month	using	 th 	 is 	 	technology	.
 an 	 other 	 	technology	that	we	've	used	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	that	of	 print 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 desk 	 top 	 	 ink 	 jet 	 	 print 	 er 	 	,	but	 in 	 stead 	 	of	using	ink	,	we	're	using	 cell 	 s 	 	.
and	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	here	the	 print 	 head 	 	going	through	and	 print 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	structure	,	and	it	 take 	 s 	 	about	40	 minute 	 s 	 	to	print	 th 	 is 	 	structure	.
and	there	's	a	3d	 elev 	 ator 	 	that	then	 actual 	 ly 	 	 go 	 es 	 	down	one	layer	at	a	time	each	time	the	 print 	 head 	 	 go 	 es 	 	through	.
and	then	 final 	 ly 	 	you	're	able	to	get	that	structure	out	.	you	can	pop	that	structure	out	of	the	 print 	 er 	 	and	implant	it	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	piece	of	bone	that	i	'm	going	to	show	you	in	 th 	 is 	 	slide	that	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 create 	 d 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	 desk 	 top 	 	 print 	 er 	 	and	 implant 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	see	here	.
that	was	all	new	bone	that	was	 implant 	 ed 	 	using	these	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	more	 advance 	 d 	 	technology	we	're	looking	at	right	now	,	our	next	generation	of	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	are	more	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	 print 	 ers 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	 print 	 er 	 	we	're	 design 	 ing 	 	now	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	one	where	we	print	right	on	the	patient	.
so	what	you	see	here	--	i	know	it	 sound 	 s 	 	funny	,	but	that	's	the	way	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	in	 re 	 ality 	 	,	what	you	want	to	do	is	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	want	to	have	the	patient	on	the	bed	with	the	wound	,	and	you	have	a	scanner	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	like	a	 flat 	 bed 	 	scanner	.
that	's	what	you	see	here	on	the	right	side	.	you	see	a	scanner	technology	that	first	 s 	 can 	 s 	 	the	wound	on	the	patient	and	then	it	 come 	 s 	 	back	with	the	 print 	 head 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 print 	 ing 	 	the	 layer 	 s 	 	that	you	 requir 	 e 	 	on	the	 patient 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	how	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 work 	 s 	 	.
here	's	the	scanner	going	through	,	 s 	 canning 	 	the	wound	.
once	it	's	 s 	 can 	 ned 	 	,	it	 s 	 end 	 s 	 	information	in	the	correct	 layer 	 s 	 	of	 cell 	 s 	 	where	they	need	to	be	.
and	now	you	're	going	to	see	here	a	demo	of	 th 	 is 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	in	a	 represent 	 ative 	 	wound	.
and	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	 th 	 is 	 	with	a	gel	so	that	you	can	lift	the	gel	material	.	so	once	 t 	 hose 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	are	on	the	patient	they	will	stick	where	they	need	to	be	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	new	technology	still	under	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
we	're	 al 	 so 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	more	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	 print 	 ers 	 	.	 be 	 cause 	 	in	 re 	 ality 	 	,	our	 big 	 gest 	 	 challeng 	 e 	 	are	the	solid	 organ 	 s 	 	.
i	do	n't	know	if	you	 real 	 ize 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	90	percent	of	the	 patient 	 s 	 	on	the	transplant	list	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	a	 kid 	 ney 	 	.
 patient 	 s 	 	are	 dy 	 ing 	 	every	day	 be 	 cause 	 	we	do	n't	have	 en 	 ough 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 organ 	 s 	 	to	go	around	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	more	 challeng 	 ing 	 	--	large	organ	,	vascular	,	a	lot	of	blood	vessel	supply	,	a	lot	of	 cell 	 s 	 	present	.
so	the	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	here	is	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	ct	 s 	 can 	 	,	an	x	-	ray	--	and	we	go	layer	by	layer	,	using	 computer 	 ized 	 	 morpho 	 metric 	 	 im 	 aging 	 	analysis	and	3d	 re 	 construction 	 	to	get	right	down	to	 t 	 hose 	 	patient	's	own	 kid 	 ney 	 s 	 	.
we	then	are	able	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	image	 t 	 hose 	 	,	do	360	degree	 rot 	 ation 	 	to	 analyz 	 e 	 	the	 kid 	 ney 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	full	 volu 	 metric 	 	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	,	and	we	then	are	able	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	take	 th 	 is 	 	information	and	then	 s 	 can 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	a	 print 	 ing 	 	 computer 	 ized 	 	form	.
so	we	go	layer	by	layer	through	the	organ	,	 analyz 	 ing 	 	each	layer	 a 	 s 	 	we	go	through	the	organ	,
and	we	then	are	able	to	 s 	 end 	 	that	information	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	see	here	,	through	the	computer	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	design	the	organ
for	the	patient	.
 th 	 is 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 show 	 s 	 	the	actual	 print 	 er 	 	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 show 	 s 	 	that	 print 	 ing 	 	.
in	fact	,	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	the	 print 	 er 	 	right	here	.	so	while	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	the	 print 	 er 	 	back	here	in	the	back	stage	.
that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	actual	 print 	 er 	 	right	now	,	and	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	 print 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 kid 	 ney 	 	structure	that	you	see	here	.
it	 take 	 s 	 	about	seven	 hour 	 s 	 	to	print	a	 kid 	 ney 	 	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	about	three	 hour 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	it	now	.
and	dr.	kang	's	going	to	walk	 on 	 stage 	 	right	now	,	and	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	to	show	you	one	of	these	 kid 	 ney 	 s 	 	that	we	 print 	 ed 	 	a	little	bit	 ear 	 lier 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
put	a	pair	of	 glove 	 s 	 	here	.
thank	you	.
go	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	.
so	,	these	 glove 	 s 	 	are	a	little	bit	small	on	me	,	but	here	it	is	.
you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	that	 kid 	 ney 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	was	 print 	 ed 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
 ha 	 s 	 	a	little	bit	of	 consist 	 ency 	 	to	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	dr.	kang	who	's	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	with	us	on	 th 	 is 	 	project	,	and	part	of	our	team	.
thank	you	,	dr.	kang	.	i	appreciate	it	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	new	generation	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	 print 	 er 	 	that	you	see	here	 on 	 stage 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	new	technology	we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	on	now	.
in	 re 	 ality 	 	,	we	now	have	a	long	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	share	with	you	a	clip	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	technology	we	have	had	in	 patient 	 s 	 	now	for	a	while	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	brief	clip	--	 on 	 ly 	 	about	30	 second 	 s 	 	--	of	a	patient	who	 actual 	 ly 	 	 receiv 	 ed 	 	an	organ	.
luke	massella	:	i	was	 re 	 ally 	 	sick	.	i	could	 bare 	 ly 	 	get	out	of	bed	.
i	was	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	school	.	it	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 mis 	 er 	 able 	 	.
i	could	n't	go	out	and	play	 basket 	 ball 	 	at	recess	 with 	 out 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	like	i	was	going	to	pass	out	when	i	got	back	 in 	 side 	 	.
i	felt	so	sick	.
i	was	facing	 bas 	 ically 	 	a	 life 	 time 	 	of	 dia 	 lysis 	 	,	and	i	do	n't	even	like	to	think	about	what	my	life	would	be	like	if	i	was	on	that	.
