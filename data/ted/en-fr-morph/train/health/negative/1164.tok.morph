 th 	 is 	 	story	is	about	taking	 imagin 	 ation 	 	 serious 	 ly 	 	.
 four 	 teen 	 	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	first	 en 	 counter 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	material	,	 fish 	 net 	 	,	used	the	same	way	for	centuries	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	i	'm	using	it	to	create	permanent	,	 bill 	 ow 	 ing 	 	,	 volu 	 pt 	 uous 	 	 form 	 s 	 	the	scale	of	hard	-	 ed 	 ged 	 	 building 	 s 	 	in	cities	around	the	world	.
i	was	an	 un 	 like 	 ly 	 	person	to	be	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	never	 stud 	 ied 	 	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	,	 engineer 	 ing 	 	or	 architect 	 ure 	 	.
in	fact	,	after	college	i	 appli 	 ed 	 	to	seven	art	 school 	 s 	 	and	was	 reject 	 ed 	 	by	all	seven	.
i	went	off	on	my	own	to	 be 	 come 	 	an	artist	,	and	i	 paint 	 ed 	 	for	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	when	i	was	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	a	fulbright	to	india	.
promising	to	give	 exhibit 	 ions 	 	of	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	i	 ship 	 ped 	 	my	 paint 	 s 	 	and	 arriv 	 ed 	 	in	mahabalipuram	.
the	 dead 	 line 	 	for	the	show	 arriv 	 ed 	 	--	my	 paint 	 s 	 	did	n't	.
i	had	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 fish 	 ing 	 	village	was	famous	for	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	.	so	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	 bron 	 ze 	 	 cast 	 ing 	 	.
but	to	make	large	 form 	 s 	 	was	too	heavy	and	expensive	.
i	went	for	a	walk	on	the	beach	,	 watch 	 ing 	 	the	 fish 	 er 	 men 	 	 bundl 	 e 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 net 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 mound 	 s 	 	on	the	sand	.
i	'd	 s 	 een 	 	it	every	day	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	time	i	saw	it	 different 	 ly 	 	--	a	new	approach	to	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	,	a	way	to	make	 volu 	 metric 	 	form	 with 	 out 	 	heavy	solid	 material 	 s 	 	.
my	first	 satisfy 	 ing 	 	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	was	made	in	 collabor 	 ation 	 	with	these	 fish 	 er 	 men 	 	.
it	's	a	self	-	portrait	titled	``	wide	 hip 	 s 	 	.	``	we	 ho 	 ist 	 ed 	 	them	on	 pole 	 s 	 	to	photograph	.
i	 discover 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	soft	 surface 	 s 	 	 reveal 	 ed 	 	every	ripple	of	wind	in	 constant 	 ly 	 	changing	 pattern 	 s 	 	.
i	was	 mesmer 	 ized 	 	.
i	 continu 	 ed 	 	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	craft	 tradition 	 s 	 	and	 collabor 	 ating 	 	with	 artisan 	 s 	 	,	next	in	lithuania	with	lace	makers	.
i	 like 	 d 	 	the	fine	detail	it	 g 	 ave 	 	my	work	,	but	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	make	them	 large 	 r 	 	--	to	shift	from	 be 	 ing 	 	an	object	you	look	at	to	 some 	 thing 	 	you	could	get	lost	in	.
 return 	 ing 	 	to	india	to	work	with	 t 	 hose 	 	 fish 	 er 	 men 	 	,	we	made	a	net	of	a	million	and	a	half	hand	-	 ti 	 ed 	 	 knot 	 s 	 	--	 install 	 ed 	 	 brief 	 ly 	 	in	madrid	.
 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	saw	it	,	and	one	of	them	was	the	 urban 	 ist 	 	manual	sola	-	morales	who	was	 re 	 design 	 ing 	 	the	 water 	 front 	 	in	porto	,	portugal	.
he	 ask 	 ed 	 	if	i	could	build	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	permanent	piece	for	the	city	.
i	did	n't	know	if	i	could	do	that	and	preserve	my	art	.
 dur 	 able 	 	,	engineered	,	permanent	--	 t 	 hose 	 	are	in	 op 	 position 	 	to	 idio 	 syn 	 cratic 	 	,	 delic 	 ate 	 	and	ephemeral	.
for	two	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	 search 	 ed 	 	for	a	fiber	that	could	 surviv 	 e 	 	 ultra 	 viol 	 et 	 	 ray 	 s 	 	,	salt	,	air	,	 poll 	 ution 	 	,	and	at	the	same	time	remain	soft	 en 	 ough 	 	to	move	 fluid 	 ly 	 	in	the	wind	.
we	 need 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	to	hold	the	net	up	out	there	in	the	middle	of	the	traffic	circle	.
so	we	raised	 th 	 is 	 	45,000	-	pound	steel	ring	.
we	had	to	engineer	it	to	move	 grace 	 fully 	 	in	an	average	breeze	and	 surviv 	 e 	 	in	hurricane	 wind 	 s 	 	.
but	there	was	no	 engineer 	 ing 	 	 soft 	 ware 	 	to	model	 some 	 thing 	 	 por 	 ous 	 	and	moving	.
i	found	a	 brilli 	 ant 	 	 aeronautic 	 al 	 	engineer	who	 design 	 s 	 	 sail 	 s 	 	for	america	's	cup	 rac 	 ing 	 	 yacht 	 s 	 	named	peter	heppel	.
he	 help 	 ed 	 	me	tackle	the	 t 	 win 	 	 challeng 	 es 	 	of	precise	shape	and	gentle	 move 	 ment 	 	.
i	could	n't	build	 th 	 is 	 	the	way	i	 k 	 new 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	hand	-	 ti 	 ed 	 	 knot 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	n't	going	to	 with 	 stand 	 	a	hurricane	.
so	i	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	relationship	with	an	industrial	 fish 	 net 	 	 factor 	 y 	 	,	 learn 	 ed 	 	the	 vari 	 able 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	,	and	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	a	way	to	make	lace	with	them	.
there	was	no	language	to	 transl 	 ate 	 	 th 	 is 	 	ancient	,	 idio 	 syn 	 cratic 	 	 hand 	 craft 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	machine	 oper 	 ators 	 	could	produce	.
so	we	had	to	create	one	.
three	 year 	 s 	 	and	two	children	 lat 	 er 	 	,	we	raised	 th 	 is 	 	50,000	-	square	-	foot	lace	net	.
it	was	hard	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	what	i	had	 imagin 	 ed 	 	was	now	built	,	permanent	and	had	lost	 noth 	 ing 	 	in	 transl 	 ation 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 intersect 	 ion 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	 b 	 land 	 	and	 anonym 	 ous 	 	.
now	it	had	a	sense	of	place	.
i	 walk 	 ed 	 	 under 	 neath 	 	it	for	the	first	time	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	 watch 	 ed 	 	the	wind	's	 choreograph 	 y 	 	 un 	 fold 	 	,	i	felt	 shelter 	 ed 	 	and	,	at	the	same	time	,	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	 limit 	 less 	 	sky	.
my	life	was	not	going	to	be	the	same	.
i	want	to	create	these	 oa 	 s 	 es 	 	of	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	in	 space 	 s 	 	of	cities	around	the	world	.
i	'm	going	to	share	two	 direction 	 s 	 	that	are	new	in	my	work	.
historic	philadelphia	city	hall	:	 it 	 s 	 	plaza	,	i	felt	,	 need 	 ed 	 	a	material	for	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	that	was	 light 	 er 	 	than	 nett 	 ing 	 	.
so	we	 experiment 	 ed 	 	with	 tin 	 y 	 	 atom 	 ized 	 	water	 particle 	 s 	 	to	create	a	dry	 mis 	 t 	 	that	is	shaped	by	the	wind
and	in	 test 	 ing 	 	,	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	it	can	be	shaped	by	people	who	can	interact	and	move	through	it	 with 	 out 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	wet	.
i	'm	using	 th 	 is 	 	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	material	to	trace	the	 path 	 s 	 	of	 sub 	 way 	 	 train 	 s 	 	above	ground	in	real	time	--	like	an	x	-	ray	of	the	city	's	 circul 	 atory 	 	system	 un 	 fold 	 ing 	 	.
next	 challeng 	 e 	 	,	the	biennial	of	the	americas	in	denver	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	could	i	represent	the	35	 nation 	 s 	 	of	the	western	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 interconnect 	 ed 	 ness 	 	in	a	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	?
i	did	n't	know	where	to	begin	,	but	i	 s 	 aid 	 	 y 	 es 	 	.
i	read	about	the	 re 	 cent 	 	 earth 	 quake 	 	in	chile	and	the	tsunami	that	 rippl 	 ed 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	entire	 pac 	 ific 	 	ocean	.
it	 shift 	 ed 	 	the	earth	's	tectonic	 plate 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 ped 	 	up	the	planet	's	 rot 	 ation 	 	and	 liter 	 ally 	 	 short 	 ened 	 	the	length	of	the	day	.
so	i	 contact 	 ed 	 	noaa	,	and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	if	they	'd	share	 the 	 ir 	 	data	on	the	tsunami	,	and	 transl 	 ated 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
 it 	 s 	 	title	:	``	1.26	``	 refer 	 s 	 	to	the	number	of	 micro 	 second 	 s 	 	that	the	earth	's	day	was	 short 	 ened 	 	.
i	could	n't	build	 th 	 is 	 	with	a	steel	ring	,	the	way	i	 k 	 new 	 	.
 it 	 s 	 	shape	was	too	complex	now	.
so	i	 replace 	 d 	 	the	metal	 ar 	 mature 	 	with	a	soft	,	fine	mesh	of	a	fiber	15	 time 	 s 	 	 strong 	 er 	 	than	steel	.
the	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	could	now	be	 entire 	 ly 	 	soft	,	which	made	it	so	light	it	could	tie	in	to	 exist 	 ing 	 	 building 	 s 	 	--	 liter 	 ally 	 	 be 	 coming 	 	part	of	the	fabric	of	the	city	.
there	was	no	 soft 	 ware 	 	that	could	 extr 	 ude 	 	these	complex	net	 form 	 s 	 	and	model	them	with	 gravit 	 y 	 	.
so	we	had	to	create	it	.
then	i	got	a	call	from	new	york	city	 ask 	 ing 	 	if	i	could	adapt	these	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	to	 time 	 s 	 	square	or	the	high	line	.
 th 	 is 	 	new	soft	structural	method	 en 	 able 	 s 	 	me	to	model	these	and	build	these	 sculpt 	 ures 	 	at	the	scale	of	 sky 	 scrap 	 ers 	 	.
they	do	n't	have	 fund 	 ing 	 	yet	,	but	i	dream	now	of	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	these	to	cities	around	the	world	where	they	're	most	 need 	 ed 	 	.
 four 	 teen 	 	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	 search 	 ed 	 	for	 beaut 	 y 	 	in	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	in	craft	 form 	 s 	 	.
now	i	combine	them	with	hi	-	tech	 material 	 s 	 	and	 engineer 	 ing 	 	to	create	 volu 	 pt 	 uous 	 	,	 bill 	 ow 	 ing 	 	 form 	 s 	 	the	scale	of	 building 	 s 	 	.
my	 art 	 istic 	 	 horizon 	 s 	 	 continu 	 e 	 	to	grow	.
i	'll	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	 th 	 is 	 	story	.
i	got	a	call	from	a	friend	in	phoenix	.
an	attorney	in	the	 off 	 ice 	 	who	'd	never	 be 	 en 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	art	,	never	 visit 	 ed 	 	the	local	art	museum	,	 drag 	 ged 	 	 every 	 one 	 	she	could	from	the	building	and	got	them	 out 	 side 	 	to	lie	down	 under 	 neath 	 	the	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	.
there	they	 we 	 re 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	business	 suit 	 s 	 	,	 lay 	 ing 	 	in	the	grass	,	 not 	 ic 	 ing 	 	the	changing	 pattern 	 s 	 	of	wind	 be 	 side 	 	people	they	did	n't	know	,	sharing	the	 re 	 discover 	 y 	 	of	wonder	.
