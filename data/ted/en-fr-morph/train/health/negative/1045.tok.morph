you	may	have	heard	about	the	koran	's	idea	of	 para 	 dis 	 e 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	72	 virgin 	 s 	 	,
and	i	promise	i	will	come	back	to	 t 	 hose 	 	 virgin 	 s 	 	.
but	in	fact	,	here	in	the	 north 	 west 	 	,	we	're	living	 ver 	 y 	 	close	to	the	real	koranic	idea	of	 para 	 dis 	 e 	 	,	defined	36	 time 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	``	 garden 	 s 	 	 water 	 ed 	 	by	running	 stream 	 s 	 	.	``
since	i	live	on	a	 house 	 boat 	 	on	the	running	stream	of	lake	 un 	 ion 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 make 	 s 	 	perfect	sense	to	me	.
but	the	thing	is	,	how	come	it	's	news	to	most	people	?
i	know	 man 	 y 	 	well	-	intentioned	non	-	muslims	who	've	 beg 	 un 	 	 read 	 ing 	 	the	koran	,	but	 give 	 n 	 	up	,	 dis 	 concert 	 ed 	 	by	 it 	 s 	 	``	 other 	 ness 	 	.	``
the	historian	thomas	carlyle	 consider 	 ed 	 	muhammad	one	of	the	world	's	 great 	 est 	 	heroes	,	yet	even	he	 call 	 ed 	 	the	koran	``	 a 	 s 	 	 toil 	 some 	 	 read 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	i	ever	 under 	 took 	 	,	a	 wear 	 i 	 some 	 	,	 con 	 fused 	 	jumble	.	``
part	of	the	problem	,	i	think	,	is	that	we	imagine	that	the	koran	can	be	read	 a 	 s 	 	we	 usual 	 ly 	 	read	a	book	--	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	we	can	curl	up	with	it	on	a	 rain 	 y 	 	afternoon	with	a	bowl	of	 pop 	 corn 	 	 with 	 in 	 	reach	,	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	god	--	and	the	koran	is	 entire 	 ly 	 	in	the	voice	of	god	 s 	 peaking 	 	to	muhammad	--	 we 	 re 	 	just	 an 	 other 	 	author	on	the	 best 	 seller 	 	list	.
yet	the	fact	that	so	few	people	do	 actual 	 ly 	 	read	the	koran	is	 precise 	 ly 	 	why	it	's	so	easy	to	quote	--	that	is	,	to	 mis 	 quote 	 	.
 phrase 	 s 	 	and	 snip 	 pet 	 s 	 	taken	out	of	 con 	 text 	 	in	what	i	call	the	``	 high 	 light 	 er 	 	version	,	``	which	is	the	one	 favor 	 ed 	 	by	both	muslim	 fundamental 	 ists 	 	and	anti	-	muslim	islamophobes	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	past	spring	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	was	 gear 	 ing 	 	up	to	begin	writing	a	 bio 	 graphy 	 	of	muhammad	,	i	 real 	 ized 	 	i	 need 	 ed 	 	to	read	the	koran	 proper 	 ly 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	 proper 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	i	could	,	that	is	.
my	arabic	's	 reduc 	 ed 	 	by	now	to	 wield 	 ing 	 	a	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	,
so	i	took	four	well	-	known	 transl 	 ations 	 	and	 decide 	 d 	 	to	read	them	side	-	by	-	side	,	verse	-	by	-	verse	 a 	 long 	 	with	a	 transl 	 iteration 	 	and	the	original	 seven 	 th 	 	-	century	arabic	.
now	i	did	have	an	advantage	.
my	last	book	was	about	the	story	 be 	 hind 	 	the	shi'a	-	sunni	split	,	and	for	that	i	'd	 work 	 ed 	 	 close 	 ly 	 	with	the	 ear 	 liest 	 	islamic	 histo 	 ries 	 	,
so	i	 k 	 new 	 	the	 event 	 s 	 	to	which	the	koran	 constant 	 ly 	 	 refer 	 s 	 	,	 it 	 s 	 	frame	of	 re 	 ference 	 	.
i	 k 	 new 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	that	is	,	to	know	that	i	'd	be	a	tourist	in	the	koran	--	an	 inform 	 ed 	 	one	,	an	 experience 	 d 	 	one	even	,	but	still	an	 out 	 sider 	 	,	an	agnostic	jew	 read 	 ing 	 	some	else	's	holy	book	.
so	i	read	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	.
i	'd	set	 a 	 side 	 	three	 week 	 s 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	project	,	and	that	,	i	think	,	is	what	is	 me 	 ant 	 	by	``	 hub 	 ris 	 	``	--
--	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	three	 month 	 s 	 	.
i	did	resist	the	 tempt 	 ation 	 	to	skip	to	the	back	where	the	 short 	 er 	 	and	more	 clear 	 ly 	 	 mystic 	 al 	 	 chapter 	 s 	 	are	.
but	every	time	i	thought	i	was	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	get	a	handle	on	the	koran	--	that	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	``	i	get	it	now	``	--	it	would	slip	away	 over 	 night 	 	,
and	i	'd	come	back	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	 wonder 	 ing 	 	if	i	was	n't	lost	in	a	strange	land	,
and	yet	the	 terra 	 in 	 	was	 ver 	 y 	 	familiar	.
the	koran	 declare 	 s 	 	that	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	renew	the	 mess 	 age 	 	of	the	torah	and	the	gospels	.
so	one	-	third	of	it	 re 	 prise 	 s 	 	the	 st 	 ories 	 	of	biblical	 figure 	 s 	 	like	abraham	,	moses	,	joseph	,	mary	,	jesus	.
god	 him 	 self 	 	was	 utter 	 ly 	 	familiar	from	his	 ear 	 lier 	 	 manifest 	 ation 	 	 a 	 s 	 	yahweh	--	 jealous 	 ly 	 	 insist 	 ing 	 	on	no	other	 god 	 s 	 	.
the	presence	of	 camel 	 s 	 	,	 mountain 	 s 	 	,	desert	 well 	 s 	 	and	 spring 	 s 	 	took	me	back	to	the	year	i	 s 	 pent 	 	 wander 	 ing 	 	the	sinai	desert	.
and	then	there	was	the	language	,	the	 rhythm 	 ic 	 	 cad 	 ence 	 	of	it	,	 re 	 mind 	 ing 	 	me	of	 even 	 ing 	 s 	 	 s 	 pent 	 	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	bedouin	 elder 	 s 	 	 re 	 cite 	 	 hour 	 s 	 	-	long	narrative	 poem 	 s 	 	 entire 	 ly 	 	from	 memor 	 y 	 	.
and	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	grasp	why	it	's	 s 	 aid 	 	that	the	koran	is	 re 	 ally 	 	the	koran	 on 	 ly 	 	in	arabic	.
take	the	fatihah	,	the	seven	-	verse	 open 	 ing 	 	chapter	that	is	the	lord	's	 pray 	 er 	 	and	the	shema	yisrael	of	islam	 combine 	 d 	 	.
it	's	just	29	 word 	 s 	 	in	arabic	,	but	 any 	 where 	 	from	65	to	72	in	 transl 	 ation 	 	.
and	yet	the	more	you	add	,	the	more	 seem 	 s 	 	to	go	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	.
the	arabic	 ha 	 s 	 	an	 in 	 cant 	 atory 	 	,	 al 	 most 	 	 hypno 	 tic 	 	,	quality	that	 beg 	 s 	 	to	be	heard	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	read	,	felt	more	than	 analyz 	 ed 	 	.
it	 want 	 s 	 	to	be	 chant 	 ed 	 	out	loud	,	to	sound	 it 	 s 	 	music	in	the	ear	and	on	the	tongue	.
so	the	koran	in	english	is	a	kind	of	shadow	of	 it 	 self 	 	,	or	 a 	 s 	 	arthur	arberry	 call 	 ed 	 	his	version	,	``	an	 interpret 	 ation 	 	.	``
but	all	is	not	lost	in	 transl 	 ation 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	the	koran	 promise 	 s 	 	,	patience	is	 reward 	 ed 	 	,	and	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 surprise 	 s 	 	--	a	degree	of	 environment 	 al 	 	 aware 	 ness 	 	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	and	of	 human 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	mere	 steward 	 s 	 	of	god	's	creation	,	 un 	 match 	 ed 	 	in	the	 b 	 ible 	 	.
and	where	the	 b 	 ible 	 	is	 address 	 ed 	 	 exclusive 	 ly 	 	to	men	,	using	the	second	and	third	person	 mascu 	 line 	 	,	the	koran	 include 	 s 	 	women	--	 talk 	 ing 	 	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	of	 believ 	 ing 	 	men	and	 believ 	 ing 	 	women	,	 honor 	 able 	 	men	and	 honor 	 able 	 	women	.
or	take	the	 in 	 famous 	 	verse	about	 kill 	 ing 	 	the	 un 	 believ 	 ers 	 	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	say	that	,	but	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	specific	 con 	 text 	 	:	the	 anticip 	 ated 	 	 con 	 quest 	 	of	the	 sanct 	 uary 	 	city	of	mecca	where	 fight 	 ing 	 	was	 usual 	 ly 	 	 forbid 	 den 	 	,
and	the	 per 	 mission 	 	 come 	 s 	 	 hedg 	 ed 	 	about	with	 qual 	 ifier 	 s 	 	.
not	``	you	must	kill	 un 	 believ 	 ers 	 	in	mecca	,	``	but	you	can	,	you	are	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	,	but	 on 	 ly 	 	after	a	grace	period	is	over	and	 on 	 ly 	 	if	there	's	no	other	pact	in	place	and	 on 	 ly 	 	if	they	try	to	stop	you	 get 	 ting 	 	to	the	kaaba	,	and	 on 	 ly 	 	if	they	attack	you	first	.
and	even	then	--	god	is	 merci 	 ful 	 	;	 forgive 	 ness 	 	is	 suprem 	 e 	 	--	and	so	,	 essential 	 ly 	 	,	better	if	you	do	n't	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	the	 big 	 gest 	 	surprise	--	how	 flex 	 ible 	 	the	koran	is	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	in	 mind 	 s 	 	that	are	not	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	 in 	 flex 	 ible 	 	.
``	some	of	these	 verse 	 s 	 	are	definite	in	meaning	,	``	it	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	and	 other 	 s 	 	are	 ambigu 	 ous 	 	.	``
the	 per 	 verse 	 	at	heart	will	seek	out	the	 ambigu 	 ities 	 	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	create	 dis 	 cord 	 	by	pinning	down	 meaning 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	.
 on 	 ly 	 	god	 know 	 s 	 	the	true	meaning	.
the	phrase	``	god	is	subtle	``	 appear 	 s 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	,
and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	the	whole	of	the	koran	is	far	more	subtle	than	most	of	us	have	 be 	 en 	 	led	to	 believ 	 e 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	in	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	that	little	matter	of	 virgin 	 s 	 	and	 para 	 dis 	 e 	 	.
old	-	 fashion 	 ed 	 	orientalism	 come 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	play	here	.
the	word	used	four	 time 	 s 	 	is	houris	,	 render 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	dark	-	eyed	 maiden 	 s 	 	with	 s 	 well 	 ing 	 	 breast 	 s 	 	,	or	 a 	 s 	 	fair	,	high	-	bosomed	 virgin 	 s 	 	.
yet	all	there	is	in	the	original	arabic	is	that	one	word	:	houris	.
not	a	 s 	 well 	 ing 	 	breast	nor	a	high	bosom	in	sight	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	may	be	a	way	of	 say 	 ing 	 	``	 pur 	 e 	 	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	``	--	like	in	 angel 	 s 	 	--	or	it	may	be	like	the	greek	kouros	or	kórē	,	an	 e 	 ternal 	 	youth	.
but	the	truth	is	 no 	 body 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 know 	 s 	 	,	and	that	's	the	point	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	koran	is	 quit 	 e 	 	clear	when	it	 say 	 s 	 	that	you	'll	be	``	a	new	creation	in	 para 	 dis 	 e 	 	``	and	that	you	will	be	``	 re 	 create 	 d 	 	in	a	form	 un 	 known 	 	to	you	,	``	which	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	a	far	more	 appeal 	 ing 	 	prospect	than	a	virgin	.
and	that	number	72	never	 appear 	 s 	 	.
there	are	no	72	 virgin 	 s 	 	in	the	koran	.
that	idea	 on 	 ly 	 	came	 in 	 to 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	300	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	and	most	islamic	 scholar 	 s 	 	see	it	 a 	 s 	 	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	people	with	 wing 	 s 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	on	 cloud 	 s 	 	and	 strumm 	 ing 	 	 harp 	 s 	 	.
 para 	 dis 	 e 	 	is	 quit 	 e 	 	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	.
it	's	not	 virgin 	 ity 	 	;	it	's	 fec 	 un 	 d 	 ity 	 	.	it	's	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	.	it	's	 garden 	 s 	 	 water 	 ed 	 	by	running	 stream 	 s 	 	.
