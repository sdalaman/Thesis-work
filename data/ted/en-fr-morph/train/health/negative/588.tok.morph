 th 	 is 	 	is	the	exact	moment	that	i	 start 	 ed 	 	creating	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 tinker 	 ing 	 	school	.
 tinker 	 ing 	 	school	is	a	place	where	 kid 	 s 	 	can	pick	up	 stick 	 s 	 	and	 hammer 	 s 	 	and	other	 danger 	 ous 	 	 object 	 s 	 	,	and	be	 trust 	 ed 	 	.
 trust 	 ed 	 	not	to	hurt	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	and	 trust 	 ed 	 	not	to	hurt	 other 	 s 	 	.
 tinker 	 ing 	 	school	 do 	 es 	 	n't	follow	a	set	curriculum	,
and	there	are	no	 test 	 s 	 	.
we	're	not	 try 	 ing 	 	to	teach	 any 	 body 	 	any	specific	thing	.
when	the	 kid 	 s 	 	 arriv 	 e 	 	they	're	 confront 	 ed 	 	with	 lot 	 s 	 	of	stuff	:	wood	and	 nail 	 s 	 	and	rope	and	 wheel 	 s 	 	,	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 tool 	 s 	 	,	real	 tool 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	six	-	day	 immers 	 ive 	 	experience	for	the	 kid 	 s 	 	.
and	 with 	 in 	 	that	 con 	 text 	 	,	we	can	 off 	 er 	 	the	 kid 	 s 	 	time	--
 some 	 thing 	 	that	 seem 	 s 	 	in	short	supply	in	 the 	 ir 	 	over	-	 schedule 	 d 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
our	goal	is	to	ensure	that	they	 leav 	 e 	 	with	a	better	sense	of	how	to	make	 thing 	 s 	 	than	when	they	 arriv 	 ed 	 	,	and	the	deep	internal	 real 	 ization 	 	that	you	can	figure	 thing 	 s 	 	out	by	 fool 	 ing 	 	around	.
 noth 	 ing 	 	ever	 turn 	 s 	 	out	 a 	 s 	 	 plan 	 ned 	 	...	ever	.
and	the	 kid 	 s 	 	soon	learn	that	all	 project 	 s 	 	go	 a 	 wry 	 	--	and	 be 	 come 	 	at	ease	with	the	idea	that	every	step	in	a	project	is	a	step	 close 	 r 	 	to	sweet	success	,	or	 glee 	 ful 	 	 calam 	 ity 	 	.
we	start	from	 doodle 	 s 	 	and	 sketch 	 es 	 	.
and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	we	make	real	 plan 	 s 	 	.
and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	we	just	start	building	.
building	is	at	the	heart	of	the	experience	:
 hand 	 s 	 	on	,	 deep 	 ly 	 	 immers 	 ed 	 	and	fully	 commit 	 ted 	 	to	the	problem	at	hand	.
 rob 	 in 	 	and	i	,	 act 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 collabor 	 ators 	 	,	keep	the	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	of	the	 project 	 s 	 	 tilt 	 ed 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 comple 	 tion 	 	.
success	is	in	the	 do 	 ing 	 	,
and	 failure 	 s 	 	are	 celebr 	 ated 	 	and	 analyz 	 ed 	 	.
 problem 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 puzzl 	 es 	 	and	 obstacle 	 s 	 	disappear	.
when	 face 	 d 	 	with	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	difficult	 set 	 back 	 s 	 	or	 complex 	 ities 	 	,	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	behavior	 emerge 	 s 	 	:	 decor 	 ation 	 	.
 decor 	 ation 	 	of	the	 un 	 finish 	 ed 	 	project	is	a	kind	of	conceptual	 incub 	 ation 	 	.
from	these	 inter 	 lude 	 s 	 	come	deep	 in 	 sight 	 s 	 	and	 amaz 	 ing 	 	new	 approach 	 es 	 	to	solving	the	 problem 	 s 	 	that	had	them	 frust 	 rated 	 	just	 moment 	 s 	 	before	.
all	 material 	 s 	 	are	 avail 	 able 	 	for	use	.
even	 t 	 hose 	 	mundane	,	 hate 	 ful 	 	,	plastic	 grocer 	 y 	 	 bag 	 s 	 	can	 be 	 come 	 	a	bridge	 strong 	 er 	 	than	 any 	 one 	 	 imagin 	 ed 	 	.
and	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	they	build	amaze	even	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
