 th 	 is 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 be 	 en 	 	about	a	digital	revolution	,	but	i	'd	like	to	 argu 	 e 	 	that	it	's	 d 	 one 	 	;	we	won	.
we	've	had	a	digital	revolution	but	we	do	n't	need	to	keep	 hav 	 ing 	 	it	.
and	i	'd	like	to	look	after	that	,	to	look	what	 come 	 s 	 	after	the	digital	revolution	.
so	,	let	me	start	 project 	 ing 	 	forward	.
these	are	some	 project 	 s 	 	i	'm	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 to 	 day 	 	at	mit	,	looking	what	 come 	 s 	 	after	 computer 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	first	one	,	 inter 	 net 	 	zero	,	up	here	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	web	 serv 	 er 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	the	cost	and	 complex 	 ity 	 	of	an	rfid	tag	--	about	a	dollar	--	that	can	go	in	every	light	bulb	and	 door 	 knob 	 	,
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 get 	 ting 	 	 commercial 	 ized 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
and	what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	about	it	is	n't	the	cost	;	it	's	the	way	it	 encode 	 s 	 	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
it	uses	a	kind	of	a	morse	code	for	the	 inter 	 net 	 	so	you	could	 s 	 end 	 	it	 optical 	 ly 	 	;	you	can	communicate	 acoustic 	 ally 	 	through	a	power	line	,	through	rf	.	it	 take 	 s 	 	the	original	principle	of	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	which	is	inter	-	 network 	 ing 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	,	and	now	lets	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	inter	-	network	.
that	we	can	take	the	whole	idea	that	 g 	 ave 	 	birth	to	the	 inter 	 net 	 	and	 br 	 ing 	 	it	down	to	the	physical	world	in	 th 	 is 	 	 inter 	 net 	 	zero	,
 th 	 is 	 	 inter 	 net 	 	of	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	next	step	from	there	to	here	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 get 	 ting 	 	 commercial 	 ized 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
a	step	after	that	is	a	project	on	fungible	 computer 	 s 	 	.
fungible	 good 	 s 	 	in	 economic 	 s 	 	can	be	 extend 	 ed 	 	and	 trade 	 d 	 	.
so	,	half	 a 	 s 	 	much	grain	is	half	 a 	 s 	 	much	 use 	 ful 	 	,	but	half	a	baby	or	half	a	computer	is	less	 use 	 ful 	 	than	a	whole	baby	or	a	whole	computer	,	and	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	 computer 	 s 	 	that	work	that	way	.
so	,	what	you	see	in	the	 back 	 ground 	 	is	a	prototype	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	from	a	thesis	of	a	student	,	bill	butow	,	now	at	 in 	 tel 	 	,	who	 wonder 	 ed 	 	why	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	making	 big 	 ger 	 	and	 big 	 ger 	 	 chip 	 s 	 	,	you	do	n't	make	small	 chip 	 s 	 	,	put	them	in	a	 visc 	 ous 	 	medium	,	and	pour	out	computing	by	the	pound	or	by	the	square	inch	.
and	that	's	what	you	see	here	.
on	the	left	was	 post 	 script 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 render 	 ed 	 	by	a	 convention 	 al 	 	computer	;	on	the	right	is	 post 	 script 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 render 	 ed 	 	from	the	first	prototype	we	made	,	but	there	's	no	frame	 buff 	 er 	 	,	io	processor	,	any	of	that	stuff	--	it	's	just	 th 	 is 	 	material	.
 un 	 like 	 	 th 	 is 	 	screen	where	the	 dot 	 s 	 	are	 place 	 d 	 	 care 	 fully 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	raw	material	.
if	you	add	twice	 a 	 s 	 	much	of	it	,	you	have	twice	 a 	 s 	 	much	 dis 	 play 	 	.	if	you	shoot	a	gun	through	the	middle	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	.
if	you	need	more	resource	,	you	just	 app 	 ly 	 	more	computer	.
so	,	that	's	the	step	after	 th 	 is 	 	--	of	computing	 a 	 s 	 	a	raw	material	.
that	's	still	 convention 	 al 	 	bits	,	the	step	after	that	is	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 ear 	 lier 	 	prototype	in	the	lab	;	 th 	 is 	 	is	high	-	speed	video	 s 	 low 	 ed 	 	down	.
now	,	 integ 	 rating 	 	 chemist 	 ry 	 	in	computation	,	where	the	bits	are	 bubble 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 show 	 ing 	 	making	bits	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 show 	 ing 	 	--	once	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 s 	 low 	 ed 	 	down	so	you	can	see	it	,	bits	 interact 	 ing 	 	to	do	logic	and	multiplexing	and	de	-	multiplexing	.
so	,	now	we	can	compute	that	the	 out 	 put 	 	 arrange 	 s 	 	material	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	information	.	and	,	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	these	are	some	 slide 	 s 	 	from	an	early	project	i	did	,	computing	where	the	bits	are	 store 	 d 	 	 quant 	 um 	 	-	 mechanic 	 ally 	 	in	the	nuclei	of	 atom 	 s 	 	,	so	 program 	 s 	 	 re 	 arrange 	 	the	nuclear	structure	of	 molecule 	 s 	 	.
all	of	these	are	in	the	lab	 push 	 ing 	 	further	and	further	and	further	,	not	 a 	 s 	 	metaphor	but	 liter 	 ally 	 	 integ 	 rating 	 	bits	and	 atom 	 s 	 	,	and	they	lead	to	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	 re 	 cognition 	 	.
we	all	know	we	've	had	a	digital	revolution	,	but	what	is	that	?
well	,	shannon	took	us	,	in	the	'40s	,	from	here	to	here	:	from	a	 tele 	 phone 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	a	speaker	wire	that	 de 	 grad 	 ed 	 	with	distance	to	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.	and	he	 prov 	 ed 	 	the	first	threshold	 theor 	 em 	 	,	that	 show 	 s 	 	if	you	add	information	and	 re 	 move 	 	it	to	a	signal	,	you	can	compute	 perfect 	 ly 	 	with	an	 im 	 perfect 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	.
and	that	's	when	we	got	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
von	neumann	,	in	the	'50s	,	did	the	same	thing	for	computing	;
he	 show 	 ed 	 	you	can	have	an	 un 	 reli 	 able 	 	computer	but	 re 	 store 	 	 it 	 s 	 	state	to	make	it	perfect	.	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	last	great	analog	computer	at	mit	:	a	 different 	 ial 	 	analyzer	,	and	the	more	you	ran	it	,	the	 wo 	 rse 	 	the	answer	got	.
after	von	neumann	,	we	have	the	pentium	,	where	the	 billion 	 th 	 	transistor	is	 a 	 s 	 	 reli 	 able 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	first	one	.
but	all	our	 fabric 	 ation 	 	is	down	in	 th 	 is 	 	lower	left	corner	.
a	state	-	of	-	the	-	art	 air 	 plane 	 	 factor 	 y 	 	 rot 	 ating 	 	metal	wax	at	 fix 	 ed 	 	metal	,	or	you	 may 	 be 	 	melt	some	plastic	.	a	10	-	billion	-	dollar	chip	fab	uses	a	process	a	village	artisan	would	 recogn 	 ize 	 	--	you	spread	stuff	around	and	bake	it	.
all	the	 intellig 	 ence 	 	is	external	to	the	system	;
the	 material 	 s 	 	do	n't	have	information	.
 yester 	 day 	 	you	heard	about	 mole 	 cular 	 	biology	,	which	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	 compute 	 s 	 	to	build	.
it	's	an	information	 process 	 ing 	 	system	.
we	've	had	digital	 revolution 	 s 	 	in	communication	and	computation	,	but	 precise 	 ly 	 	the	same	idea	,	 precise 	 ly 	 	the	same	math	shannon	and	von	neuman	did	,	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	yet	come	out	to	the	physical	world	.	so	,	inspired	by	that	,	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	program	--	the	center	for	bits	and	 atom 	 s 	 	at	mit	--	which	is	a	group	of	people	,	like	me	,	who	never	 under 	 stood 	 	the	 bound 	 ary 	 	between	physical	science	and	computer	science	.	i	would	even	go	further	and	say	computer	science	is	one	of	the	worst	 thing 	 s 	 	that	ever	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	either	 computer 	 s 	 	or	to	science	--	--	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 can 	 on 	 	--	computer	science	--	 man 	 y 	 	of	them	are	great	but	the	 can 	 on 	 	of	computer	science	 pre 	 mature 	 ly 	 	froze	a	model	of	computation	based	on	technology	that	was	 avail 	 able 	 	in	1950	,	and	nature	's	a	much	more	 power 	 ful 	 	computer	than	that	.
so	,	you	'll	hear	,	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	,	from	saul	griffith	.	he	was	one	of	the	first	 student 	 s 	 	to	emerge	from	 th 	 is 	 	program	.
we	 start 	 ed 	 	to	figure	out	how	you	can	compute	to	 fabric 	 ate 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	just	a	proof	of	principle	he	did	of	 tile 	 s 	 	that	interact	 magnet 	 ically 	 	,	where	you	write	a	code	,	much	like	protein	 fold 	 ing 	 	,	that	 spec 	 ifies 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	structure	.
so	,	there	's	no	 feed 	 back 	 	to	a	tool	metrology	;	the	material	 it 	 self 	 	 code 	 s 	 	for	 it 	 s 	 	structure	in	just	the	same	ways	that	protein	are	 fabric 	 ated 	 	.	so	,	you	can	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	do	that	.
you	can	do	other	 thing 	 s 	 	.	that	's	in	2d	.	it	 work 	 s 	 	in	3d	.
the	video	on	the	upper	right	--	i	wo	n't	show	for	time	--	 show 	 s 	 	self	-	 replica 	 tion 	 	,	templating	so	 some 	 thing 	 	can	make	 some 	 thing 	 	that	can	make	 some 	 thing 	 	,	and	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	that	now	over	,	 may 	 be 	 	,	nine	 order 	 s 	 	of	 magn 	 itude 	 	.	 t 	 hose 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	used	to	show	the	best	fidelity	and	direct	rate	dna	to	make	an	organism	,
in	functionalizing	nanoclusters	with	peptide	 tail 	 s 	 	that	code	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 assem 	 bly 	 	--	so	,	much	like	the	 magnet 	 s 	 	,	but	now	on	 nano 	 meter 	 	 scale 	 s 	 	.
laser	micro	-	 ma 	 chin 	 ing 	 	:	 essential 	 ly 	 	3d	 print 	 ers 	 	that	 digital 	 ly 	 	 fabric 	 ate 	 	functional	 system 	 s 	 	,	all	the	way	up	to	building	 building 	 s 	 	,	not	by	 hav 	 ing 	 	 blue 	 print 	 s 	 	,	but	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	 part 	 s 	 	code	for	the	structure	of	the	building	.
so	,	these	are	early	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	in	the	lab	of	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	to	 digit 	 ize 	 	 fabric 	 ation 	 	.	 computer 	 s 	 	that	do	n't	control	 tool 	 s 	 	but	 computer 	 s 	 	that	are	 tool 	 s 	 	,	where	the	 out 	 put 	 	of	a	program	rearranges	 atom 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	bits	.
now	,	to	do	that	--	with	your	tax	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	thank	you	--	i	 b 	 ought 	 	all	these	 machine 	 s 	 	.	we	made	a	modest	proposal	to	the	nsf	.	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	able	to	make	 any 	 thing 	 	on	any	length	scale	,	all	in	one	place	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	ca	n't	segregate	digital	 fabric 	 ation 	 	by	a	discipline	or	a	length	scale	.
so	we	put	together	focused	nano	beam	 writer 	 s 	 	and	 super 	 sonic 	 	water	jet	cutters	and	excimer	micro	-	 ma 	 chin 	 ing 	 	 system 	 s 	 	.
but	i	had	a	problem	.	once	i	had	all	these	 machine 	 s 	 	,	i	was	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	too	much	time	 teach 	 ing 	 	 student 	 s 	 	to	use	them	.
so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 teach 	 ing 	 	a	class	,	 modest 	 ly 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	,	``	how	to	make	 al 	 most 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	.	``	and	that	was	n't	 me 	 ant 	 	to	be	 pro 	 voc 	 ative 	 	;	it	was	just	for	a	few	research	 student 	 s 	 	.
but	the	first	day	of	class	 look 	 ed 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
you	know	,	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	people	came	in	 beg 	 ging 	 	,	all	my	life	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	class	;	i	'll	do	 any 	 thing 	 	to	do	it	.
then	they	'd	ask	,	can	you	teach	it	at	mit	?	it	 seem 	 s 	 	too	 use 	 ful 	 	?
and	then	the	next	--
--	surprising	thing	was	they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	there	to	do	research	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	there	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	make	stuff	.
they	had	no	 convention 	 al 	 	technical	 back 	 ground 	 	.
at	the	end	of	a	semester	they	 integrate 	 d 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	.
i	'll	show	an	old	video	.	kelly	was	a	 sculpt 	 or 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	she	did	with	her	semester	project	.
:	kelly	:	hi	,	i	'm	kelly	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	 s 	 cream 	 	 bud 	 dy 	 	.
do	you	ever	find	 your 	 self 	 	in	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	where	you	 re 	 ally 	 	have	to	 s 	 cream 	 	,	but	you	ca	n't	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	at	work	,	or	you	're	in	a	 class 	 room 	 	,	or	you	're	 watch 	 ing 	 	your	children	,	or	you	're	in	any	number	of	 situ 	 ations 	 	where	it	's	just	not	 permit 	 ted 	 	?
well	,	 s 	 cream 	 	 bud 	 dy 	 	is	a	 port 	 able 	 	space	for	 s 	 cream 	 ing 	 	.
when	a	user	 s 	 cream 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 s 	 cream 	 	 bud 	 dy 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 s 	 cream 	 	is	 silence 	 d 	 	.
it	is	 al 	 so 	 	 record 	 ed 	 	for	 lat 	 er 	 	 re 	 lease 	 	where	,	when	and	how	the	user	 choos 	 es 	 	.
so	,	einstein	would	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	student	made	a	web	 brow 	 s 	 er 	 	for	parrots	--	lets	parrots	surf	the	net	and	talk	to	other	parrots	.
 th 	 is 	 	student	's	made	an	alarm	clock	you	 wrestl 	 e 	 	to	prove	you	're	awake	;	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	that	 defend 	 s 	 	--	a	dress	that	 defend 	 s 	 	your	personal	space	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	technology	for	communication	;	it	's	technology	to	prevent	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 de 	 vice 	 	that	lets	you	see	your	music	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	student	who	made	a	machine	that	 make 	 s 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	,	and	he	made	it	by	making	lego	 brick 	 s 	 	that	do	the	computing	.
just	year	after	year	--	and	i	 final 	 ly 	 	 real 	 ized 	 	the	 student 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 show 	 ing 	 	the	killer	app	of	personal	 fabric 	 ation 	 	is	 product 	 s 	 	for	a	market	of	one	person	.
you	do	n't	need	 th 	 is 	 	for	what	you	can	get	in	wal	-	mart	;	you	need	 th 	 is 	 	for	what	 make 	 s 	 	you	 un 	 ique 	 	.
ken	olsen	 famous 	 ly 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 no 	 body 	 	 need 	 s 	 	a	computer	in	the	home	.
but	you	do	n't	use	it	for	 inventor 	 y 	 	and	 pay 	 roll 	 	;
dec	is	now	twice	bankrupt	.	you	do	n't	need	personal	 fabric 	 ation 	 	in	the	home	to	buy	what	you	can	buy	 be 	 cause 	 	you	can	buy	it	.
you	need	it	for	what	 make 	 s 	 	you	 un 	 ique 	 	,	just	like	 personal 	 ization 	 	.
so	,	with	that	,	in	turn	,	20	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	;	20	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	we	'll	make	star	trek	 replica 	 tors 	 	that	make	 any 	 thing 	 	.
the	 student 	 s 	 	 hijack 	 ed 	 	all	the	 machine 	 s 	 	i	 b 	 ought 	 	to	do	personal	 fabric 	 ation 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	when	you	 s 	 pend 	 	that	much	of	your	money	,	there	's	a	government	 requir 	 ement 	 	to	do	 out 	 reach 	 	,	which	often	 mean 	 s 	 	 class 	 es 	 	at	a	local	school	,	a	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	--	stuff	that	's	just	not	that	 excit 	 ing 	 	.
so	,	i	made	a	deal	with	my	nsf	program	 manage 	 rs 	 	that	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	it	,	i	'd	give	people	the	 tool 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	n't	 me 	 ant 	 	to	be	 pro 	 voc 	 ative 	 	or	 import 	 ant 	 	,	but	we	put	together	these	fab	 lab 	 s 	 	.	it	's	about	20,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	that	approximate	both	what	the	20	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	 do 	 es 	 	and	where	it	's	going	.
a	laser	cutter	to	do	press	-	fit	 assem 	 bly 	 	with	3d	from	2d	,	a	sign	cutter	to	plot	in	 cop 	 per 	 	to	do	electromagnetics	,	a	 micro 	 n 	 	scale	,	 numeric 	 ally 	 	-	controlled	 mill 	 ing 	 	machine	for	precise	 structure 	 s 	 	,	 programm 	 ing 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	for	less	than	a	dollar	,	100	-	nanosecond	microcontrollers	.	it	lets	you	work	from	 micro 	 ns 	 	and	 micro 	 second 	 s 	 	on	up	,	and	they	 explode 	 d 	 	around	the	world	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	n't	 schedule 	 d 	 	,	but	they	went	from	inner	-	city	boston	to	pobal	in	india	,	to	secondi	-	takoradi	on	ghana	's	coast	to	soshanguve	in	a	 town 	 ship 	 	in	south	africa	,	to	the	far	north	of	norway	,	 un 	 cover 	 ing 	 	,	or	 help 	 ing 	 	 un 	 cover 	 	,	for	all	the	attention	to	the	digital	divide	,	we	would	find	 un 	 used 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	in	all	these	 place 	 s 	 	.
a	 farm 	 er 	 	in	a	 r 	 ural 	 	village	--	a	kid	 need 	 s 	 	to	measure	and	modify	the	world	,	not	just	get	information	about	it	on	a	screen	.
that	there	's	 re 	 ally 	 	a	 fabric 	 ation 	 	and	an	 instrument 	 ation 	 	divide	 big 	 ger 	 	than	the	digital	divide	.
and	the	way	you	close	it	is	not	it	for	the	 masse 	 s 	 	but	it	 develop 	 ment 	 	for	the	 masse 	 s 	 	.
so	,	in	place	after	place	we	saw	 th 	 is 	 	same	 progress 	 ion 	 	:	that	we	'd	open	one	of	these	fab	 lab 	 s 	 	,	where	we	did	n't	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	too	crazy	to	think	of	.
we	did	n't	think	 th 	 is 	 	up	,	that	we	would	get	 pull 	 ed 	 	to	these	 place 	 s 	 	;	we	'd	open	it	.	the	first	step	was	just	 empower 	 ment 	 	.
you	can	see	it	in	 the 	 ir 	 	face	,	just	 th 	 is 	 	joy	of	,	i	can	do	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	girl	in	inner	-	city	boston	who	had	just	 d 	 one 	 	a	high	-	tech	on	-	demand	craft	sale	in	the	inner	city	community	center	.
it	 go 	 es 	 	on	from	there	to	serious	 hand 	 s 	 	-	on	technical	education	 inform 	 ally 	 	,	out	of	 school 	 s 	 	.	in	ghana	we	had	set	up	one	of	these	 lab 	 s 	 	.
we	designed	a	network	sensor	,	and	 kid 	 s 	 	would	show	up	and	 re 	 fuse 	 	to	 leav 	 e 	 	the	lab	.
there	was	a	girl	who	 insist 	 ed 	 	we	stay	late	at	night	--	:	 kid 	 s 	 	:	i	love	the	fab	lab	.	--	her	first	night	in	the	lab	 be 	 cause 	 	she	was	going	to	make	the	sensor	.
so	she	 insist 	 ed 	 	on	fabbing	the	board	,	 learn 	 ing 	 	how	to	stuff	it	,	 learn 	 ing 	 	how	to	program	it	.	she	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	know	what	she	was	 do 	 ing 	 	or	why	she	was	 do 	 ing 	 	it	,	but	she	 k 	 new 	 	she	just	had	to	do	it	.	there	was	 some 	 thing 	 	electric	about	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	late	at	,	you	know	,	11	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	at	night	and	i	think	i	was	the	 on 	 ly 	 	person	 surprise 	 d 	 	when	what	she	built	 work 	 ed 	 	the	first	time	.
and	i	've	 show 	 n 	 	 th 	 is 	 	to	 engineer 	 s 	 	at	big	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	,	and	they	say	they	ca	n't	do	 th 	 is 	 	.	any	one	thing	she	's	 do 	 ing 	 	,	they	can	do	better	,	but	it	's	 distribut 	 ed 	 	over	 man 	 y 	 	people	and	 man 	 y 	 	 s 	 ites 	 	and	they	ca	n't	do	in	an	afternoon	what	 th 	 is 	 	little	girl	in	 r 	 ural 	 	ghana	is	 do 	 ing 	 	.
:	girl	:	my	name	is	valentina	kofi	;	i	am	eight	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
i	made	a	 stack 	 ing 	 	board	.
and	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	that	was	just	for	the	joy	of	it	.
then	these	 lab 	 s 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	serious	problem	solving	--	 instrument 	 ation 	 	for	 agricultur 	 e 	 	in	india	,	 s 	 team 	 	 turbine 	 s 	 	for	energy	 con 	 version 	 	in	ghana	,	high	-	gain	 antenna 	 s 	 	in	thin	client	 computer 	 s 	 	.	and	then	,	in	turn	,	 business 	 es 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	to	grow	,	like	making	these	 antenna 	 s 	 	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	the	lab	 start 	 ed 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 invent 	 ion 	 	.
we	're	 learn 	 ing 	 	more	from	them	than	we	're	giving	them	.
i	was	 show 	 ing 	 	my	 kid 	 s 	 	in	a	fab	lab	how	to	use	it	.
they	 invent 	 ed 	 	a	way	to	do	a	construction	kit	out	of	a	 card 	 board 	 	box	--	which	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	see	up	there	,	that	's	 be 	 coming 	 	a	business	--	but	 the 	 ir 	 	design	was	better	than	saul	's	design	at	mit	,	so	there	's	now	three	 student 	 s 	 	at	mit	 do 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 these 	 s 	 	on	 scal 	 ing 	 	the	work	of	eight	-	year	-	old	children	 be 	 cause 	 	they	had	better	 design 	 s 	 	.
real	 invent 	 ion 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	these	 lab 	 s 	 	.	and	i	still	 ke 	 pt 	 	--	so	,	in	the	last	year	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	time	with	 head 	 s 	 	of	state	and	 general 	 s 	 	and	 trib 	 al 	 	 chief 	 s 	 	who	all	want	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	i	keep	 say 	 ing 	 	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	the	real	thing	.	wait	,	like	,	20	 year 	 s 	 	and	then	we	'll	be	 d 	 one 	 	.
and	i	 final 	 ly 	 	got	what	's	 be 	 en 	 	going	on	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	kernigan	and	ritchie	 invent 	 ing 	 	unix	on	a	pdp	.
pdps	came	between	mainframes	and	minicomputers	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	hard	to	use	,	but	they	 br 	 ought 	 	computing	down	to	work	 group 	 s 	 	,	and	 every 	 thing 	 	we	do	 to 	 day 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	there	.
these	fab	 lab 	 s 	 	are	the	cost	and	 complex 	 ity 	 	of	a	pdp	.
the	 project 	 ion 	 	of	digital	 fabric 	 ation 	 	is	n't	a	 project 	 ion 	 	for	the	future	;	we	are	now	in	the	pdp	era	.
we	 talk 	 ed 	 	in	 hush 	 ed 	 	 tone 	 s 	 	about	the	great	 discover 	 ies 	 	then	.
it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	chaotic	,	it	was	n't	,	sort	of	,	clear	what	was	going	on	.
in	the	same	sense	we	are	now	,	 to 	 day 	 	,	in	the	minicomputer	era	of	digital	 fabric 	 ation 	 	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	problem	with	that	is	it	 break 	 s 	 	 every 	 body 	 	's	 bound 	 aries 	 	.
in	dc	,	i	go	to	every	 age 	 ncy 	 	that	 want 	 s 	 	to	talk	,	you	know	;	in	the	 ba 	 y 	 	area	,	i	go	to	every	 organ 	 ization 	 	you	can	think	of	--
they	all	want	to	talk	about	it	,	but	it	 break 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 al 	 	 bound 	 aries 	 	.	in	fact	,	it	's	 il 	 legal 	 	for	them	,	in	 man 	 y 	 	 case 	 s 	 	,	to	equip	 ordin 	 ary 	 	people	to	create	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 consum 	 e 	 	technology	.
and	that	problem	is	so	severe	that	the	ultimate	 invent 	 ion 	 	coming	from	 th 	 is 	 	community	 surprise 	 d 	 	me	:	it	's	the	social	 engineer 	 ing 	 	.	that	the	lab	in	far	north	of	norway	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	so	far	north	 it 	 s 	 	satellite	 dish 	 es 	 	look	at	the	ground	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	the	sky	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	where	the	 satellite 	 s 	 	are	--	the	lab	outgrew	the	little	barn	that	it	was	in	.	it	was	there	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	find	 animal 	 s 	 	in	the	 mountain 	 s 	 	but	it	outgrew	it	,	so	they	built	 th 	 is 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	village	for	the	lab	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	a	university	;	it	's	not	a	company	.	it	's	 essential 	 ly 	 	a	village	for	 invent 	 ion 	 	;	it	's	a	village	for	the	 out 	 lier 	 s 	 	in	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	growing	up	around	these	fab	 lab 	 s 	 	all	around	the	world	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	program	 ha 	 s 	 	split	 in 	 to 	 	an	ngo	 found 	 ation 	 	,	a	fab	 found 	 ation 	 	to	support	the	 scal 	 ing 	 	,	a	micro	vc	fund	.
the	person	who	 run 	 s 	 	it	 nice 	 ly 	 	 de 	 scribe 	 s 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	``	 machine 	 s 	 	that	make	 machine 	 s 	 	need	 business 	 es 	 	that	make	 business 	 es 	 	:	``
it	's	a	cross	between	micro	-	finance	and	vc	to	do	fan	-	out	,	and	then	the	research	 partner 	 ship 	 s 	 	back	at	mit	for	what	's	making	it	possible	.
so	i	'd	like	to	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	two	 thought 	 s 	 	.
there	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	sea	change	in	aid	,	from	top	-	down	mega	-	 project 	 s 	 	to	bottom	-	up	,	 grass 	 root 	 s 	 	,	micro	-	finance	 invest 	 ing 	 	in	the	 root 	 s 	 	,	so	that	 every 	 body 	 	's	got	that	that	's	what	 work 	 s 	 	.
but	we	still	look	at	technology	 a 	 s 	 	top	-	down	mega	-	 project 	 s 	 	.
computing	,	communication	,	energy	for	the	rest	of	the	planet	are	these	top	-	down	mega	-	 project 	 s 	 	.
if	 th 	 is 	 	room	full	of	heroes	is	just	clever	 en 	 ough 	 	,	you	can	solve	the	 problem 	 s 	 	.
the	 mess 	 age 	 	coming	from	the	fab	 lab 	 s 	 	is	that	the	other	five	billion	people	on	the	planet	are	n't	just	technical	 sink 	 s 	 	;	they	're	 source 	 s 	 	.
the	real	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	is	to	harness	the	 invent 	 ive 	 	power	of	the	world	to	 local 	 ly 	 	design	and	produce	 solution 	 s 	 	to	local	 problem 	 s 	 	.
i	thought	that	's	the	 project 	 ion 	 	20	 year 	 s 	 	 h 	 ence 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	future	,	but	it	's	where	we	are	 to 	 day 	 	.
it	 break 	 s 	 	every	 organ 	 ization 	 al 	 	 bound 	 ary 	 	we	can	think	of	.
the	 hard 	 est 	 	thing	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	is	the	social	 engineer 	 ing 	 	and	the	 organ 	 ization 	 al 	 	 engineer 	 ing 	 	,	but	it	's	here	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	,	 final 	 ly 	 	,	any	talk	like	 th 	 is 	 	on	the	future	of	computing	is	 requir 	 ed 	 	to	show	moore	's	law	,	but	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	version	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	gordon	moore	's	original	one	from	his	original	paper	--	and	what	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	is	,	year	after	year	after	year	,	we	've	 scale 	 d 	 	and	we	've	 scale 	 d 	 	and	we	've	 scale 	 d 	 	and	we	've	 scale 	 d 	 	,	and	we	've	 scale 	 d 	 	and	we	've	 scale 	 d 	 	,	and	we	've	 scale 	 d 	 	and	we	've	 scale 	 d 	 	,	and	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	 loom 	 ing 	 	bug	of	what	's	going	to	happen	at	the	end	of	moore	's	law	;	 th 	 is 	 	ultimate	bug	is	coming	.
but	we	're	coming	to	appreciate	,	is	the	 transit 	 ion 	 	from	2d	to	3d	,	from	 programm 	 ing 	 	bits	to	 programm 	 ing 	 	 atom 	 s 	 	,	 turn 	 s 	 	the	 end 	 s 	 	of	moore	's	law	 scal 	 ing 	 	from	the	ultimate	bug	to	the	ultimate	feature	.
so	,	we	're	just	at	the	edge	of	 th 	 is 	 	digital	revolution	in	 fabric 	 ation 	 	,	where	the	 out 	 put 	 	of	computation	 program 	 s 	 	the	physical	world	.	so	,	together	,	these	two	 project 	 s 	 	answer	 question 	 s 	 	i	had	n't	 ask 	 ed 	 	 care 	 fully 	 	.	the	class	at	mit	 show 	 s 	 	the	killer	app	for	personal	 fabric 	 ation 	 	in	the	 develop 	 ed 	 	world	is	technology	for	a	market	of	one	:	personal	 express 	 ion 	 	in	technology	that	 touch 	 es 	 	a	 pass 	 ion 	 	 un 	 like 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	i	've	 s 	 een 	 	in	technology	for	a	 ver 	 y 	 	long	time	.
