chris	anderson	:	we	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	debate	.
the	debate	is	over	the	 pro 	 position 	 	:	``	what	the	world	 need 	 s 	 	now	is	nuclear	energy	.	``	true	or	false	?
and	before	we	have	the	debate	,	i	'd	like	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	take	a	show	of	 hand 	 s 	 	--	on	balance	,	right	now	,	are	you	for	or	against	 th 	 is 	 	?
so	 t 	 hose 	 	who	are	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	``	raise	your	hand	.	``	for	.	``
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	 hand 	 s 	 	down	.
 t 	 hose 	 	who	are	against	,	raise	your	 hand 	 s 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	i	'm	 read 	 ing 	 	that	at	about	75	to	25	in	favor	at	the	start	.
which	 mean 	 s 	 	we	're	going	to	take	a	vote	at	the	end	and	see	how	that	 shift 	 s 	 	,	if	at	all	.
so	here	's	the	format	:	they	're	going	to	have	six	 minute 	 s 	 	each	,	and	then	after	one	little	,	quick	 ex 	 change 	 	between	them	,
i	want	two	people	on	each	side	of	 th 	 is 	 	debate	in	the	audience	to	have	30	 second 	 s 	 	to	make	one	short	,	crisp	,	 pun 	 gent 	 	,	 power 	 ful 	 	point	.
so	,	in	favor	of	the	 pro 	 position 	 	,	possibly	 shock 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	is	one	of	,	 tru 	 ly 	 	,	the	 founder 	 s 	 	of	the	 environment 	 al 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	,	a	long	-	 stand 	 ing 	 	tedster	,	the	founder	of	the	whole	earth	catalog	,
 some 	 one 	 	we	all	know	and	love	,	stewart	brand	.
stewart	brand	:	 who 	 a 	 	.
the	 say 	 ing 	 	is	that	with	climate	,	 t 	 hose 	 	who	know	the	most	are	the	most	 worri 	 ed 	 	.
with	nuclear	,	 t 	 hose 	 	who	know	the	most	are	the	 l 	 east 	 	 worri 	 ed 	 	.
a	classic	 ex 	 ample 	 	is	james	hansen	,	a	nasa	 climato 	 logist 	 	 push 	 ing 	 	for	350	 part 	 s 	 	per	million	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	in	the	atmosphere	.
he	came	out	with	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	book	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 storm 	 s 	 	of	my	 grand 	 children 	 	.	``
and	hansen	is	hard	over	for	nuclear	power	,	 a 	 s 	 	are	most	 climato 	 logists 	 	who	are	 engag 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	issue	 serious 	 ly 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	design	 situ 	 ation 	 	:	a	planet	that	is	facing	climate	change	and	is	now	half	urban	.
look	at	the	client	base	for	 th 	 is 	 	.
five	out	of	six	of	us	live	in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	.
we	are	moving	to	cities	.	we	are	moving	up	in	the	world	.
and	we	are	 educ 	 ating 	 	our	 kid 	 s 	 	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	 few 	 er 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	good	news	all	around	.
but	we	move	to	cities	,	 to 	 ward 	 	the	bright	 light 	 s 	 	,	and	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	is	there	that	we	want	,	 be 	 side 	 s 	 	 job 	 s 	 	,	is	 electric 	 ity 	 	.
and	if	it	is	n't	 eas 	 ily 	 	gotten	,	we	'll	go	 a 	 head 	 	and	steal	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	most	 desir 	 ed 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	by	poor	people	all	over	the	world	,	in	the	cities	and	in	the	 country 	 side 	 	.
 electric 	 ity 	 	for	cities	,	at	 it 	 s 	 	best	,	is	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	 base 	 load 	 	 electric 	 ity 	 	.
that	's	where	it	is	on	all	the	time	.
and	so	far	there	are	 on 	 ly 	 	three	major	 source 	 s 	 	of	that	--	coal	and	gas	,	hydro	-	electric	,	which	in	most	 place 	 s 	 	is	 max 	 ed 	 	-	out	--	and	nuclear	.
i	would	love	to	have	 some 	 thing 	 	in	the	fourth	place	here	,	but	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	constant	,	clean	,	 scal 	 able 	 	energy	,	[	solar	]	and	wind	and	the	other	 renew 	 able 	 s 	 	are	n't	there	yet	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 in 	 constant 	 	.
nuclear	is	and	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	for	40	 year 	 s 	 	.
now	,	from	an	 environment 	 al 	 	 stand 	 point 	 	,	the	main	thing	you	want	to	look	at	is	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	the	waste	from	nuclear	and	from	coal	,	the	two	major	 source 	 s 	 	of	 electric 	 ity 	 	.
if	all	of	your	 electric 	 ity 	 	in	your	 life 	 time 	 	came	from	nuclear	,	the	waste	from	that	 life 	 time 	 	of	 electric 	 ity 	 	would	go	in	a	 co 	 ke 	 	can	--	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	heavy	 co 	 ke 	 	can	,	about	two	 pound 	 s 	 	.
but	one	day	of	coal	 add 	 s 	 	up	to	one	hell	of	a	lot	of	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	in	a	normal	one	-	gigawatt	coal	-	 fire 	 d 	 	plant	.
then	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	the	waste	?
the	nuclear	waste	 typical 	 ly 	 	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	dry	cask	 s 	 to 	 rage 	 	out	back	of	the	 park 	 ing 	 	lot	at	the	reactor	 s 	 ite 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	most	 place 	 s 	 	do	n't	have	 under 	 ground 	 	 s 	 to 	 rage 	 	yet	.
it	's	just	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	can	stay	where	it	is	.
while	the	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	,	vast	 quant 	 ities 	 	of	it	,	 giga 	 ton 	 s 	 	,	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	atmosphere	where	we	ca	n't	get	it	back	--	yet	--	and	where	it	is	 caus 	 ing 	 	the	 problem 	 s 	 	that	we	're	most	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	.
so	when	you	add	up	the	 green 	 house 	 	 gas 	 es 	 	in	the	 life 	 time 	 	of	these	 vari 	 ous 	 	energy	 source 	 s 	 	,	nuclear	is	down	there	with	wind	and	hydro	,	 be 	 low 	 	solar	and	way	 be 	 low 	 	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	all	the	fossil	 fuel 	 s 	 	.
wind	is	 wonder 	 ful 	 	;	i	love	wind	.
i	love	 be 	 ing 	 	around	these	big	wind	 gene 	 rator 	 s 	 	.
but	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	're	 discover 	 ing 	 	is	that	wind	,	like	solar	,	is	an	 actual 	 ly 	 	 relat 	 ively 	 	 di 	 lute 	 	source	of	energy	.
and	so	it	 take 	 s 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	large	 foot 	 print 	 	on	the	land	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	large	 foot 	 print 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 material 	 s 	 	,	five	to	10	 time 	 s 	 	what	you	'd	use	for	nuclear	,	and	 typical 	 ly 	 	to	get	one	gigawatt	of	 electric 	 ity 	 	is	on	the	order	of	250	square	 mile 	 s 	 	of	wind	farm	.
in	 place 	 s 	 	like	denmark	and	germany	,	they	've	 max 	 ed 	 	out	on	wind	 al 	 ready 	 	.
they	've	run	out	of	good	 s 	 ites 	 	.
the	power	lines	are	 get 	 ting 	 	 over 	 load 	 ed 	 	.
and	you	peak	out	.
 like 	 wise 	 	,	with	solar	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	here	in	california	,	we	're	 discover 	 ing 	 	that	the	80	solar	farm	 scheme 	 s 	 	that	are	going	forward	want	to	 bas 	 ically 	 	bulldoze	1,000	square	 mile 	 s 	 	of	southern	california	desert	.
well	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	 environment 	 alist 	 	,	we	would	 ra 	 ther 	 	that	did	n't	happen	.
it	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	on	frapped	-	out	 agricultur 	 al 	 	land	.
solar	's	 wonder 	 ful 	 	on	 roof 	 top 	 s 	 	.
but	out	in	the	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	,	one	gigawatt	is	on	the	order	of	50	square	 mile 	 s 	 	of	 bulldoze 	 d 	 	desert	.
when	you	add	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	up	--	saul	griffith	did	the	 number 	 s 	 	and	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	what	would	it	take	to	get	13	clean	 tera 	 watt 	 s 	 	of	energy	from	wind	,	solar	and	 bio 	 fuel 	 s 	 	,	and	that	area	would	be	 rough 	 ly 	 	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	an	area	he	 refer 	 s 	 	to	 a 	 s 	 	``	renewistan	.	``
a	guy	who	's	 add 	 ed 	 	it	up	all	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	well	is	david	mackay	,	a	physicist	in	england	,
and	in	his	 wonder 	 ful 	 	book	,	``	 sustain 	 able 	 	energy	,	``	among	other	 thing 	 s 	 	,	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	'm	not	 try 	 ing 	 	to	be	pro	-	nuclear	.	i	'm	just	pro	-	arithmetic	.	``
in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 weapon 	 s 	 	,	the	best	 dis 	 armament 	 	tool	so	far	is	nuclear	energy	.
we	have	 be 	 en 	 	taking	down	the	russian	 war 	 head 	 s 	 	,	 turn 	 ing 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	 electric 	 ity 	 	.
ten	percent	of	american	 electric 	 ity 	 	 come 	 s 	 	from	 de 	 commission 	 ed 	 	 war 	 head 	 s 	 	.
we	have	n't	even	 start 	 ed 	 	the	american	 stock 	 pile 	 	.
i	think	of	most	interest	to	a	ted	audience	would	be	the	new	generation	of	 reactor 	 s 	 	that	are	 ver 	 y 	 	small	,	down	around	10	to	125	 megawatt 	 s 	 	.

and	that	would	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	.

his	first	time	at	ted	,	possibly	a	 dis 	 advantage 	 	--	we	 s 	 hall 	 	see	--	from	stanford	,	professor	mark	jacobson	.	good	luck	.
mark	jacobson	:	thank	you	.
so	my	 pre 	 mise 	 	here	is	that	nuclear	energy	 put 	 s 	 	out	more	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	,	 put 	 s 	 	out	more	air	 pollutant 	 s 	 	,	 enhance 	 s 	 	 mortal 	 ity 	 	more	and	 take 	 s 	 	 long 	 er 	 	to	put	up	than	real	 renew 	 able 	 	energy	 system 	 s 	 	,	 name 	 ly 	 	wind	,	solar	,	 geo 	 thermal 	 	power	,	hydro	-	 tid 	 al 	 	wave	power	.
and	it	 al 	 so 	 	 enhance 	 s 	 	nuclear	 weapon 	 s 	 	 pro 	 life 	 ration 	 	.
so	let	's	start	just	by	looking	at	the	co	2	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	from	the	life	cycle	.
co	2e	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	are	 equi 	 valent 	 	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	of	all	the	 green 	 house 	 	 gas 	 es 	 	and	 particle 	 s 	 	that	cause	 warm 	 ing 	 	and	 convert 	 ed 	 	to	co	2	.
and	if	you	look	,	wind	and	 concent 	 rated 	 	solar	have	the	 low 	 est 	 	co	2	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	,	if	you	look	at	the	graph	.
nuclear	--	there	are	two	 bar 	 s 	 	here	.
one	is	a	low	estimate	,	and	one	is	a	high	estimate	.
the	low	estimate	is	the	nuclear	energy	industry	estimate	of	nuclear	.
the	high	is	the	average	of	103	scientific	,	peer	-	 review 	 ed 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	the	co	2	from	the	life	cycle	.
if	we	look	at	the	 delay 	 s 	 	,	it	 take 	 s 	 	between	10	and	19	 year 	 s 	 	to	put	up	a	nuclear	power	plant	from	 plan 	 ning 	 	to	operation	.
 th 	 is 	 	 include 	 s 	 	about	three	and	a	half	to	six	 year 	 s 	 	for	a	 s 	 ite 	 	permit	.
and	 an 	 other 	 	two	and	a	half	to	four	 year 	 s 	 	for	a	construction	permit	and	issue	,	and	then	four	to	nine	 year 	 s 	 	for	actual	construction	.
and	in	 chin 	 a 	 	,	right	now	,	they	're	 put 	 ting 	 	up	five	 gigawatt 	 s 	 	of	nuclear	.
and	the	average	,	just	for	the	construction	time	of	these	,	is	7.1	 year 	 s 	 	on	top	of	any	 plan 	 ning 	 	 time 	 s 	 	.
while	you	're	 wait 	 ing 	 	around	for	your	nuclear	,	you	have	to	run	the	regular	electric	power	grid	,	which	is	 most 	 ly 	 	coal	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	and	around	the	world	.
and	the	chart	here	 show 	 s 	 	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	the	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	from	the	regular	grid	,	 result 	 ing 	 	if	you	use	nuclear	,	or	 any 	 thing 	 	else	,	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	wind	,	csp	or	 photovoltaic 	 s 	 	.
wind	 take 	 s 	 	about	two	to	five	 year 	 s 	 	on	average	,	same	 a 	 s 	 	 concent 	 rated 	 	solar	and	 photovoltaic 	 s 	 	.
so	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	is	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	cost	of	using	nuclear	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	wind	,	or	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
so	if	you	add	these	two	together	,	 al 	 one 	 	,	you	can	see	a	 separat 	 ion 	 	that	nuclear	 put 	 s 	 	out	at	 l 	 east 	 	nine	to	17	 time 	 s 	 	more	co	2	 equi 	 valent 	 	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	than	wind	energy	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	even	account	for	the	 foot 	 print 	 	on	the	ground	.
if	you	look	at	the	air	 poll 	 ution 	 	health	 effect 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	number	of	 death 	 s 	 	per	year	in	2020	just	from	vehicle	exhaust	.
let	's	say	we	 convert 	 ed 	 	all	the	 vehicle 	 s 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	to	 batt 	 ery 	 	electric	 vehicle 	 s 	 	,	hydrogen	fuel	cell	 vehicle 	 s 	 	or	flex	fuel	 vehicle 	 s 	 	run	on	e	85	.
well	,	right	now	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	50	to	100,000	people	die	per	year	from	air	 poll 	 ution 	 	,	and	 vehicle 	 s 	 	are	about	25,000	of	 t 	 hose 	 	.
in	2020	,	the	number	will	go	down	to	15,000	due	to	 improve 	 ments 	 	.
and	so	,	on	the	right	,	you	see	 gas 	 o 	 line 	 	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	,	the	death	rates	of	2020	.
if	you	go	to	corn	or	 cell 	 ulosic 	 	ethanol	,	you	'd	 actual 	 ly 	 	 in 	 crease 	 	the	death	rate	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	.
if	you	go	to	nuclear	,	you	do	get	a	big	 r 	 eduction 	 	,	but	it	's	not	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	with	wind	and	 concent 	 rated 	 	solar	.
now	if	you	consider	the	fact	that	nuclear	 weapon 	 s 	 	 pro 	 life 	 ration 	 	is	 associate 	 d 	 	with	nuclear	energy	 pro 	 life 	 ration 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	know	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	india	and	pakistan	 develop 	 ed 	 	nuclear	 weapon 	 s 	 	 secret 	 ly 	 	by	 enrich 	 ing 	 	 ur 	 an 	 ium 	 	in	nuclear	energy	 facil 	 ities 	 	.
north	korea	did	that	to	some	 ex 	 tent 	 	.
iran	is	 do 	 ing 	 	that	right	now	.
and	venezuela	would	be	 do 	 ing 	 	it	if	they	 start 	 ed 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	nuclear	energy	 facil 	 ities 	 	.
if	you	do	a	large	scale	expansion	of	nuclear	energy	 a 	 cross 	 	the	world	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	there	was	just	one	nuclear	bomb	 create 	 d 	 	that	was	used	to	destroy	a	city	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	mumbai	or	some	other	big	city	,	 mega 	 city 	 	,	the	 add 	 ition 	 al 	 	death	rates	due	to	 th 	 is 	 	 average 	 d 	 	over	30	 year 	 s 	 	and	then	 scale 	 d 	 	to	the	population	of	the	u.s.	would	be	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	,	do	we	need	 th 	 is 	 	?
the	next	thing	is	:	what	about	the	 foot 	 print 	 	?	stewart	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	the	 foot 	 print 	 	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	the	 foot 	 print 	 	on	the	ground	for	wind	is	by	far	the	 small 	 est 	 	of	any	energy	source	in	the	world	.
that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 foot 	 print 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	is	just	the	pole	 touch 	 ing 	 	the	ground	.
and	you	can	power	the	entire	u.s.	vehicle	fleet	with	73,000	to	145,000	five	-	megawatt	wind	 turbine 	 s 	 	.
that	would	take	between	one	and	three	square	 kilometer 	 s 	 
of	 foot 	 print 	 	on	the	ground	,	 entire 	 ly 	 	.
the	 s 	 pac 	 ing 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
that	's	the	 foot 	 print 	 	that	is	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 con 	 fused 	 	.
people	 con 	 fuse 	 	 foot 	 print 	 	with	 s 	 pac 	 ing 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	from	these	 picture 	 s 	 	,	the	 s 	 pac 	 ing 	 	between	can	be	used	for	 multi 	 ple 	 	 purpose 	 s 	 	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 agricultur 	 al 	 	land	,	range	land	or	open	space	.
over	the	ocean	,	it	's	not	even	land	.
now	if	we	look	at	nuclear	--	with	nuclear	,	what	do	we	have	?
we	have	 facil 	 ities 	 	around	there	.	you	 al 	 so 	 	have	a	 buff 	 er 	 	zone	that	's	17	square	 kilometer 	 s 	 	.
and	you	have	the	 ur 	 an 	 ium 	 	 min 	 ing 	 	that	you	have	to	deal	with	.
now	if	we	go	to	the	area	,	 lot 	 s 	 	is	 wo 	 rse 	 	than	nuclear	or	wind	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 cell 	 ulosic 	 	ethanol	,	to	power	the	entire	u.s.	vehicle	fleet	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	much	land	you	would	need	.
that	's	 cell 	 ulosic 	 	,	second	generation	 bio 	 fuel 	 s 	 	from	prairie	grass	.
here	's	corn	ethanol	.	it	's	 small 	 er 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	based	on	 range 	 s 	 	from	data	,	but	if	you	look	at	nuclear	,	it	would	be	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	rhode	 is 	 land 	 	to	power	the	u.s.	vehicle	fleet	.
for	wind	,	there	's	a	 large 	 r 	 	area	,	but	much	 small 	 er 	 	 foot 	 print 	 	.
and	of	course	,	with	wind	,	you	could	put	it	all	over	the	east	coast	,	 off 	 shore 	 	 theoretic 	 ally 	 	,	or	you	can	split	it	up	.
and	now	,	if	you	go	back	to	looking	at	 geo 	 thermal 	 	,	it	's	even	 small 	 er 	 	than	both	,	and	solar	is	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 large 	 r 	 	than	the	nuclear	 s 	 pac 	 ing 	 	,	but	it	's	still	 pre 	 tty 	 	small	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	to	power	the	entire	u.s.	vehicle	fleet	.
to	power	the	entire	world	with	50	percent	wind	,	you	would	need	about	one	percent	of	world	land	.
 match 	 ing 	 	the	 reli 	 ability 	 	,	base	load	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ir 	 relevant 	 	.
we	want	to	match	the	hour	-	by	-	hour	power	supply	.
you	can	do	that	by	 comb 	 in 	 ing 	 	 renew 	 able 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	from	real	data	in	california	,	looking	at	wind	data	and	solar	data	.
and	it	 consider 	 s 	 	just	using	 exist 	 ing 	 	hydro	to	match	the	hour	-	by	-	hour	power	demand	.
here	are	the	world	wind	 resource 	 s 	 	.
there	's	five	to	10	 time 	 s 	 	more	wind	 avail 	 able 	 	 world 	 wide 	 	than	we	need	for	all	the	world	.
so	then	here	's	the	final	 rank 	 ing 	 	.
and	one	last	slide	i	just	want	to	show	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	choice	:
you	can	either	have	wind	or	nuclear	.
if	you	use	wind	,	you	guarantee	ice	will	last	.
nuclear	,	the	time	lag	 al 	 one 	 	will	allow	the	 arc 	 tic 	 	to	melt	and	other	 place 	 s 	 	to	melt	more	.
and	we	can	guarantee	a	clean	,	blue	sky	or	an	 un 	 certain 	 	future	with	nuclear	power	.
ca	:	all	right	.
so	while	they	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 come 	 back 	 s 	 	on	each	other	--	and	 your 	 s 	 	is	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	short	 be 	 cause 	 	you	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 over 	 ran 	 	--	i	need	two	people	from	either	side	.
so	if	you	're	for	 th 	 is 	 	,	if	you	're	for	nuclear	power	,	put	up	two	 hand 	 s 	 	.
if	you	're	against	,	put	up	one	.
and	i	want	two	of	each	for	the	 mic 	 s 	 	.
now	then	,	you	 guy 	 s 	 	have	--	you	have	a	minute	 come 	 back 	 	on	him	to	pick	up	a	point	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 challeng 	 e 	 	it	,	 what 	 ever 	 	.
sb	:	i	think	a	point	of	 differ 	 ence 	 	we	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	,	mark	,	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	with	 weapon 	 s 	 	and	energy	.
these	 dia 	 gram 	 s 	 	that	show	that	nuclear	is	 some 	 how 	 	 put 	 ting 	 	out	a	lot	of	 green 	 house 	 	 gas 	 es 	 	--	a	lot	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	include	,	``	well	of	course	war	will	be	 inevit 	 able 	 	and	 there 	 fore 	 	we	'll	have	cities	 burn 	 ing 	 	and	stuff	like	that	,	``	which	is	kind	of	 fine 	 s 	 s 	 ing 	 	it	a	little	bit	,	i	think	.
the	 re 	 ality 	 	is	that	there	's	,	what	,	21	 nation 	 s 	 	that	have	nuclear	power	?
of	 t 	 hose 	 	,	seven	have	nuclear	 weapon 	 s 	 	.
in	every	case	,	they	got	the	 weapon 	 s 	 	before	they	got	the	nuclear	power	.
there	are	two	 nation 	 s 	 	,	north	korea	and	israel	,	that	have	nuclear	 weapon 	 s 	 	and	do	n't	have	nuclear	power	at	all	.
the	 place 	 s 	 	that	we	would	most	like	to	have	 re 	 ally 	 	clean	energy	occur	are	 chin 	 a 	 	,	india	,	europe	,	north	america	,	all	of	which	have	 sort 	 ed 	 	out	 the 	 ir 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	in	relation	to	nuclear	 weapon 	 s 	 	.
so	that	 leav 	 es 	 	a	couple	of	 place 	 s 	 	like	iran	,	 may 	 be 	 	venezuela	,	that	you	would	like	to	have	 ver 	 y 	 	close	 sur 	 veil 	 lance 	 	of	 any 	 thing 	 	that	 go 	 es 	 	on	with	fissile	stuff	.
 push 	 ing 	 	 a 	 head 	 	with	nuclear	power	will	mean	we	 re 	 ally 	 	know	where	all	of	the	fissile	material	is	,	and	we	can	move	 to 	 ward 	 	zero	 weapon 	 s 	 	left	,	once	we	know	all	that	.
ca	:	mark	,	30	 second 	 s 	 	,	either	on	that	or	on	 any 	 thing 	 	stewart	 s 	 aid 	 	.
mj	:	well	we	know	india	and	pakistan	had	nuclear	energy	first	,	and	then	they	 develop 	 ed 	 	nuclear	 weapon 	 s 	 	 secret 	 ly 	 	in	the	 factor 	 ies 	 	.
so	the	other	thing	is	,	we	do	n't	need	nuclear	energy	.
there	's	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	solar	and	wind	.
you	can	make	it	 reli 	 able 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 show 	 ed 	 	with	that	 dia 	 gram 	 	.
that	's	from	real	data	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 on 	 going 	 	research	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	rocket	science	.
solving	the	world	's	 problem 	 s 	 	can	be	 d 	 one 	 	,	if	you	 re 	 ally 	 	put	your	mind	to	it	and	use	clean	,	 renew 	 able 	 	energy	.
there	's	 absolute 	 ly 	 	no	need	for	nuclear	power	.
ca	:	we	need	 some 	 one 	 	for	.
rod	beckstrom	:	thank	you	chris	.	i	'm	rod	beckstrom	,	ceo	of	icann	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	policy	since	1994	,	when	i	 join 	 ed 	 	the	board	of	 environment 	 al 	 	defense	fund	that	was	one	of	the	 craft 	 ers 	 	of	the	kyoto	 proto 	 col 	 	.
and	i	want	to	support	stewart	brand	's	position	.
i	've	come	around	in	the	last	10	 year 	 s 	 	.
i	used	to	be	against	nuclear	power	.
i	'm	now	 support 	 ing 	 	stewart	's	position	,	 soft 	 ly 	 	,	from	a	risk	-	management	 stand 	 point 	 	,	 agree 	 ing 	 	that	the	 risk 	 s 	 	of	 over 	 heat 	 ing 	 	the	planet	outweigh	the	risk	of	nuclear	incident	,	which	 certain 	 ly 	 	is	possible	and	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	real	problem	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	i	think	there	may	be	a	win	-	win	solution	here	where	both	 part 	 ies 	 	can	win	 th 	 is 	 	debate	,	and	that	is	,	we	face	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	where	it	's	carbon	 cap 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	or	die	.
and	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	senate	,	we	need	 bi 	 partisan 	 	support	--	 on 	 ly 	 	one	or	two	 vote 	 s 	 	are	 need 	 ed 	 	--	to	move	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	through	the	senate	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	room	can	help	.
so	if	we	get	that	through	,	then	mark	will	solve	these	 problem 	 s 	 	.	 thank 	 s 	 	chris	.
ca	:	thank	you	rod	beckstrom	.	against	.
david	fanton	:	hi	,	i	'm	david	fanton	.	i	just	want	to	say	a	couple	quick	 thing 	 s 	 	.
the	first	is	:	be	aware	of	the	 propag 	 and 	 a 	 	.
the	 propag 	 and 	 a 	 	from	the	industry	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	.
and	we	have	not	had	the	other	side	of	the	argument	fully	 air 	 ed 	 	so	that	people	can	draw	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 con 	 clusion 	 s 	 	.
be	 ver 	 y 	 	aware	of	the	 propag 	 and 	 a 	 	.
 second 	 ly 	 	,	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
if	we	build	all	these	nuclear	power	 plant 	 s 	 	,	all	that	waste	is	going	to	be	on	 hundred 	 s 	 	,	if	not	 thousand 	 s 	 	,	of	 truck 	 s 	 	and	 train 	 s 	 	,	moving	through	 th 	 is 	 	country	every	day	.
tell	me	they	're	not	going	to	have	 accident 	 s 	 	.
tell	me	that	 t 	 hose 	 	 accident 	 s 	 	are	n't	going	to	put	material	 in 	 to 	 	the	environment	that	is	 poison 	 ous 	 	for	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	then	tell	me	that	each	and	every	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 truck 	 s 	 	and	 train 	 s 	 	is	n't	a	potential	terrorist	target	.
ca	:	thank	you	.
for	.
 any 	 one 	 	else	for	?	go	.
alex	:	hi	,	i	'm	alex	.	i	just	 want 	 ed 	 	to	say	,	i	'm	,	first	of	all	,	 renew 	 able 	 	energy	's	 big 	 gest 	 	fan	.
i	've	got	solar	pv	on	my	roof	.
i	've	got	a	hydro	 con 	 version 	 	at	a	 water 	 mill 	 	that	i	own	.
and	i	'm	,	you	know	,	 ver 	 y 	 	much	``	pro	``	that	kind	of	stuff	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	there	's	a	 bas 	 ic 	 	arithmetic	problem	here	.
the	 cap 	 ability 	 	of	the	 s 	 un 	 	 shin 	 ing 	 	,	the	wind	 blow 	 ing 	 	and	the	rain	 fall 	 ing 	 	,	 simpl 	 y 	 	is	n't	 en 	 ough 	 	to	add	up	.
so	if	we	want	to	keep	the	 light 	 s 	 	on	,	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	need	a	solution	which	is	going	to	keep	generating	all	of	the	time	.
i	 campaign 	 ed 	 	against	nuclear	 weapon 	 s 	 	in	the	'80s	,	and	i	 continu 	 e 	 	to	do	so	now	.
but	we	've	got	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	 re 	 cycle 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	more	 use 	 ful 	 	that	 en 	 able 	 s 	 	us	to	get	energy	all	of	the	time	.
and	,	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	the	arithmetic	problem	is	n't	going	to	go	away	.
we	're	not	going	to	get	 en 	 ough 	 	energy	from	 renew 	 able 	 s 	 	 al 	 one 	 	.
we	need	a	solution	that	 generate 	 s 	 	all	of	the	time	.
if	we	're	going	to	keep	the	 light 	 s 	 	on	,	nuclear	is	that	solution	.
ca	:	thank	you	.
 any 	 one 	 	else	against	?
man	:	the	last	person	who	was	in	favor	made	the	 pre 	 mise 	 	that	we	do	n't	have	 en 	 ough 	 	 alter 	 native 	 	 renew 	 able 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	.
and	our	``	against	``	proponent	up	here	made	it	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	that	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	.
and	so	the	 fall 	 acy 	 	that	we	need	 th 	 is 	 	resource	and	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	make	it	in	a	time	frame	that	is	 meaning 	 ful 	 	is	not	possible	.
i	will	 al 	 so 	 	add	one	other	thing	.
ray	kurzweil	and	all	the	other	 talk 	 s 	 	--	we	know	that	the	stick	is	going	up	 exponential 	 ly 	 	.
so	you	ca	n't	look	at	state	-	of	-	the	-	art	 techno 	 logies 	 	in	 renew 	 able 	 s 	 	and	say	,	``	that	's	all	we	have	.	``
 be 	 cause 	 	five	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	,	it	will	blow	you	away	what	we	'll	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	 a 	 s 	 	 alter 	 native 	 s 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	 horr 	 ible 	 	,	 dis 	 astro 	 us 	 	nuclear	power	.
ca	:	point	well	made	.	thank	you	.
so	each	of	you	 ha 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	just	a	couple	 sentence 	 s 	 	--	30	 second 	 s 	 	each	to	sum	up	.
your	final	pitch	,	stewart	.
sb	:	i	 love 	 d 	 	your	``	it	all	 balance 	 s 	 	out	``	chart	that	you	had	there	.
it	was	a	 s 	 un 	 ny 	 	day	and	a	 wind 	 y 	 	night	.
and	just	now	in	england	they	had	a	cold	spell	.
all	of	the	wind	in	the	entire	country	shut	down	for	a	week	.
 non 	 e 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 stir 	 ring 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	usual	,	they	had	to	buy	nuclear	power	from	france	.
two	 gigawatt 	 s 	 	 come 	 s 	 	through	the	chunnel	.
 th 	 is 	 	 keep 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
i	used	to	worry	about	the	10,000	year	factor	.
and	the	fact	is	,	we	're	going	to	use	the	nuclear	waste	we	have	for	fuel	in	the	fourth	generation	of	 reactor 	 s 	 	that	are	coming	 a 	 long 	 	.
and	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	the	small	 reactor 	 s 	 	need	to	go	forward	.
i	heard	from	nathan	myhrvold	--	and	i	think	here	's	the	action	point	--	it	'll	take	an	act	of	congress	to	make	the	nuclear	 regulat 	 ory 	 	commission	start	moving	 quick 	 ly 	 	on	these	small	 reactor 	 s 	 	,	which	we	need	 ver 	 y 	 	much	,	here	and	in	the	world	.
mj	:	so	we	've	 analyz 	 ed 	 	the	hour	-	by	-	hour	power	demand	and	supply	,	looking	at	solar	,	wind	,	using	data	for	california	.
and	you	can	match	that	demand	,	hour	-	by	-	hour	,	for	the	whole	year	 al 	 most 	 	.
now	,	with	regard	to	the	 resource 	 s 	 	,	we	've	 develop 	 ed 	 	the	first	wind	map	of	the	world	,	from	data	 al 	 one 	 	,	at	80	 meter 	 s 	 	.
we	know	what	the	wind	 resource 	 s 	 	are	.	you	can	cover	15	percent	.
fifteen	percent	of	the	entire	u.s.	 ha 	 s 	 	wind	at	fast	 en 	 ough 	 	 speed 	 s 	 	to	be	cost	-	competitive	.
and	there	's	much	more	solar	than	there	is	wind	.
there	's	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	resource	.	you	can	make	it	 reli 	 able 	 	.
ca	:	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	so	,	thank	you	,	mark	.
so	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	in	palm	 spring 	 s 	 	...
 shame 	 less 	 	.	 shame 	 less 	 	.	 shame 	 less 	 	.
so	,	people	of	the	ted	community	,	i	put	it	to	you	that	what	the	world	 need 	 s 	 	now	is	nuclear	energy	.
all	 t 	 hose 	 	in	favor	,	raise	your	 hand 	 s 	 	.
and	all	 t 	 hose 	 	against	.
ooooh	.
now	that	is	--	my	take	on	that	...	just	put	up	...	 hand 	 s 	 	up	,	people	who	 change 	 d 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 mind 	 s 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	debate	,	who	 vot 	 ed 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	 change 	 d 	 	your	mind	in	favor	of	``	for	``	put	your	 hand 	 s 	 	up	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	so	here	's	the	read	on	it	.
both	people	won	 support 	 ers 	 	,	but	on	my	count	,	the	mood	of	the	ted	community	 shift 	 ed 	 	from	about	75	to	25	to	about	65	to	35	in	favor	,	in	favor	.
you	both	won	.	i	 congratula 	 te 	 	both	of	you	.
