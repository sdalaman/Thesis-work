mark	zuckerberg	,	a	journalist	was	 ask 	 ing 	 	him	a	question	about	the	news	feed	.
and	the	journalist	was	 ask 	 ing 	 	him	,	``	why	is	 th 	 is 	 	so	 import 	 ant 	 	?	``
and	zuckerberg	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	a	squirrel	 dy 	 ing 	 	in	your	front	yard	may	be	more	relevant	to	your	 interest 	 s 	 	right	now	than	people	 dy 	 ing 	 	in	africa	.	``
and	i	want	to	talk	about	what	a	web	based	on	that	idea	of	relevance	might	look	like	.
so	when	i	was	growing	up	in	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 r 	 ural 	 	area	in	maine	,	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	different	to	me	.
it	 me 	 ant 	 	a	 connect 	 ion 	 	to	the	world	.
it	 me 	 ant 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	would	connect	us	all	together	.
and	i	was	 s 	 ure 	 	that	it	was	going	to	be	great	for	 demo 	 cracy 	 	and	for	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
but	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	shift	in	how	information	is	 flow 	 ing 	 	 on 	 line 	 	,	and	it	's	 in 	 visible 	 	.
and	if	we	do	n't	pay	attention	to	it	,	it	could	be	a	real	problem	.
so	i	first	 notice 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	a	place	i	 s 	 pend 	 	a	lot	of	time	--	my	facebook	page	.
i	'm	 progress 	 ive 	 	,	 politic 	 ally 	 	--	big	surprise	--	but	i	've	 al 	 ways 	 	gone	out	of	my	way	to	meet	 conserv 	 ative 	 s 	 	.
i	like	 hear 	 ing 	 	what	they	're	 think 	 ing 	 	about	;	i	like	 see 	 ing 	 	what	they	link	to	;	i	like	 learn 	 ing 	 	a	thing	or	two	.
and	so	i	was	 surprise 	 d 	 	when	i	 notice 	 d 	 	one	day	that	the	 conserv 	 ative 	 s 	 	had	 disappear 	 ed 	 	from	my	facebook	feed	.
and	what	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	was	going	on	was	that	facebook	was	looking	at	which	 link 	 s 	 	i	 click 	 ed 	 	on	,	and	it	was	 not 	 ic 	 ing 	 	that	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	was	 click 	 ing 	 	more	on	my	liberal	 friend 	 s 	 	'	 link 	 s 	 	than	on	my	 conserv 	 ative 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	'	 link 	 s 	 	.
and	 with 	 out 	 	 consult 	 ing 	 	me	about	it	,	it	had	 edit 	 ed 	 	them	out	.
they	 disappear 	 ed 	 	.
so	facebook	is	n't	the	 on 	 ly 	 	place	that	's	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 in 	 visible 	 	,	 algorithm 	 ic 	 	 edit 	 ing 	 	of	the	web	.
google	's	 do 	 ing 	 	it	too	.
if	i	search	for	 some 	 thing 	 	,	and	you	search	for	 some 	 thing 	 	,	even	right	now	at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	same	time	,	we	may	get	 ver 	 y 	 	different	search	 result 	 s 	 	.
even	if	you	're	 log 	 ged 	 	out	,	one	engineer	told	me	,	there	are	57	 signal 	 s 	 	that	google	 look 	 s 	 	at	--	 every 	 thing 	 	from	what	kind	of	computer	you	're	on	to	what	kind	of	 brow 	 s 	 er 	 	you	're	using	to	where	you	're	 locate 	 d 	 	--	that	it	uses	to	 personal 	 ly 	 	tailor	your	 que 	 ry 	 	 result 	 s 	 	.
think	about	it	for	a	second	:	there	is	no	standard	google	 any 	 more 	 	.
and	you	know	,	the	funny	thing	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	it	's	hard	to	see	.
you	ca	n't	see	how	different	your	search	 result 	 s 	 	are	from	 any 	 one 	 	else	's	.
but	a	couple	of	 week 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	a	bunch	of	 friend 	 s 	 	to	google	``	egypt	``	and	to	 s 	 end 	 	me	screen	 shot 	 s 	 	of	what	they	got	.
so	here	's	my	friend	scott	's	screen	shot	.
and	here	's	my	friend	daniel	's	screen	shot	.
when	you	put	them	side	-	by	-	side	,	you	do	n't	even	have	to	read	the	 link 	 s 	 	to	see	how	different	these	two	 page 	 s 	 	are	.
but	when	you	do	read	the	 link 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	.
daniel	did	n't	get	 any 	 thing 	 	about	the	 protest 	 s 	 	in	egypt	at	all	in	his	first	page	of	google	 result 	 s 	 	.
scott	's	 result 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	full	of	them	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	big	story	of	the	day	at	that	time	.
that	's	how	different	these	 result 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 coming 	 	.
so	it	's	not	just	google	and	facebook	either	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	 s 	 weep 	 ing 	 	the	web	.
there	are	a	whole	host	of	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	that	are	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 personal 	 ization 	 	.
yahoo	news	,	the	 big 	 gest 	 	news	 s 	 ite 	 	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	is	now	 personal 	 ized 	 	--	different	people	get	different	 thing 	 s 	 	.
huffington	post	,	the	washington	post	,	the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	--	all	 flirt 	 ing 	 	with	 personal 	 ization 	 	in	 vari 	 ous 	 	ways	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 move 	 s 	 	us	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	a	world	in	which	the	 inter 	 net 	 	is	 show 	 ing 	 	us	what	it	 think 	 s 	 	we	want	to	see	,	but	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	what	we	need	to	see	.
 a 	 s 	 	eric	schmidt	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	it	will	be	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	for	people	to	watch	or	 consum 	 e 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	not	in	some	sense	 be 	 en 	 	 tailor 	 ed 	 	for	them	.	``
so	i	do	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	problem	.
and	i	think	,	if	you	take	all	of	these	 filter 	 s 	 	together	,	you	take	all	these	 algorithm 	 s 	 	,	you	get	what	i	call	a	filter	bubble	.
and	your	filter	bubble	is	your	own	personal	,	 un 	 ique 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	of	information	that	you	live	in	 on 	 line 	 	.
and	what	's	in	your	filter	bubble	 depend 	 s 	 	on	who	you	are	,	and	it	 depend 	 s 	 	on	what	you	do	.
but	the	thing	is	that	you	do	n't	decide	what	 get 	 s 	 	in	.
and	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	you	do	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	what	 get 	 s 	 	 edit 	 ed 	 	out	.
so	one	of	the	 problem 	 s 	 	with	the	filter	bubble	was	 discover 	 ed 	 	by	some	 research 	 ers 	 	at	netflix	.
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	looking	at	the	netflix	 queue 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 notice 	 d 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	kind	of	funny	that	a	lot	of	us	 prob 	 ably 	 	have	 notice 	 d 	 	,	which	is	there	are	some	 movie 	 s 	 	that	just	sort	of	zip	right	up	and	out	to	our	 house 	 s 	 	.
they	enter	the	queue	,	they	just	zip	right	out	.
so	``	iron	man	``	 zip 	 s 	 	right	out	,	and	``	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	 super 	 man 	 	``	can	wait	for	a	 re 	 ally 	 	long	time	.
what	they	 discover 	 ed 	 	was	that	in	our	netflix	 queue 	 s 	 	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	epic	struggle	going	on	between	our	future	 aspir 	 ation 	 al 	 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	our	more	 im 	 puls 	 ive 	 	present	 s 	 elves 	 	.
you	know	we	all	want	to	be	 some 	 one 	 	who	 ha 	 s 	 	 watch 	 ed 	 	``	rashomon	,	``	but	right	now	we	want	to	watch	``	ace	ventura	``	for	the	fourth	time	.
so	the	best	 edit 	 ing 	 	 give 	 s 	 	us	a	bit	of	both	.
it	 give 	 s 	 	us	a	little	bit	of	justin	bieber	and	a	little	bit	of	afghanistan	.
it	 give 	 s 	 	us	some	information	 veget 	 able 	 s 	 	;	it	 give 	 s 	 	us	some	information	dessert	.
and	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	with	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 algorithm 	 ic 	 	 filter 	 s 	 	,	these	 personal 	 ized 	 	 filter 	 s 	 	,	is	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 main 	 ly 	 	looking	at	what	you	click	on	first	,	it	can	throw	off	that	balance	.
and	 in 	 stead 	 	of	a	 balanc 	 ed 	 	information	diet	,	you	can	end	up	 surround 	 ed 	 	by	information	junk	food	.
what	 th 	 is 	 	 suggest 	 s 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	that	we	may	have	the	story	about	the	 inter 	 net 	 	wrong	.
in	a	 broad 	 cast 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	the	 found 	 ing 	 	 mytho 	 logy 	 	 go 	 es 	 	--	in	a	 broad 	 cast 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	these	 gate 	 keeper 	 s 	 	,	the	 editor 	 s 	 	,	and	they	controlled	the	 flow 	 s 	 	of	information	.
and	 a 	 long 	 	came	the	 inter 	 net 	 	and	it	 s 	 wept 	 	them	out	of	the	way	,	and	it	 allow 	 ed 	 	all	of	us	to	connect	together	,	and	it	was	awesome	.
but	that	's	not	 actual 	 ly 	 	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	right	now	.
what	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	is	more	of	a	 pass 	 ing 	 	of	the	torch	from	human	 gate 	 keeper 	 s 	 	to	 algorithm 	 ic 	 	 one 	 s 	 	.
and	the	thing	is	that	the	 algorithm 	 s 	 	do	n't	yet	have	the	kind	of	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	 ethic 	 s 	 	that	the	 editor 	 s 	 	did	.
so	if	 algorithm 	 s 	 	are	going	to	 cur 	 ate 	 	the	world	for	us	,	if	they	're	going	to	decide	what	we	get	to	see	and	what	we	do	n't	get	to	see	,	then	we	need	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	they	're	not	just	 key 	 ed 	 	to	relevance	.
we	need	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	they	 al 	 so 	 	show	us	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	or	 challeng 	 ing 	 	or	 import 	 ant 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	ted	 do 	 es 	 	--	other	 point 	 s 	 	of	view	.
and	the	thing	is	,	we	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	here	before	 a 	 s 	 	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
in	1915	,	it	's	not	like	 news 	 paper 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 sweat 	 ing 	 	a	lot	about	 the 	 ir 	 	civic	 respons 	 ibilities 	 	.
then	people	 notice 	 d 	 	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
that	,	in	fact	,	you	could	n't	have	a	 function 	 ing 	 	 demo 	 cracy 	 	if	 citizen 	 s 	 	did	n't	get	a	good	flow	of	information	,
that	the	 news 	 paper 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	critical	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 act 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	filter	,	and	then	 journalist 	 ic 	 	 ethic 	 s 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	.
it	was	n't	perfect	,	but	it	got	us	through	the	last	century	.
and	so	now	,	we	're	kind	of	back	in	1915	on	the	web	.
and	we	need	the	new	 gate 	 keeper 	 s 	 	to	encode	that	kind	of	 respons 	 ibility 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	code	that	they	're	writing	.
i	know	that	there	are	a	lot	of	people	here	from	facebook	and	from	google	--	larry	and	sergey	--	people	who	have	 help 	 ed 	 	build	the	web	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	,	and	i	'm	 grat 	 e 	 ful 	 	for	that	.
but	we	 re 	 ally 	 	need	you	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	these	 algorithm 	 s 	 	have	 encode 	 d 	 	in	them	a	sense	of	the	public	life	,	a	sense	of	civic	 respons 	 ibility 	 	.
we	need	you	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	they	're	 trans 	 parent 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	that	we	can	see	what	the	 rule 	 s 	 	are	that	determine	what	 get 	 s 	 	through	our	 filter 	 s 	 	.
and	we	need	you	to	give	us	some	control	so	that	we	can	decide	what	 get 	 s 	 	through	and	what	 do 	 es 	 	n't	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	we	 re 	 ally 	 	need	the	 inter 	 net 	 	to	be	that	thing	that	we	all	 dream 	 ed 	 	of	it	 be 	 ing 	 	.
we	need	it	to	connect	us	all	together	.
we	need	it	to	 introduc 	 e 	 	us	to	new	 idea 	 s 	 	and	new	people	and	different	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	not	going	to	do	that	if	it	 leav 	 es 	 	us	all	 isolate 	 d 	 	in	a	web	of	one	.
thank	you	.
