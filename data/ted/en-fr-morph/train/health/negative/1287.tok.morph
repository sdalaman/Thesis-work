so	that	's	johnny	depp	,	of	course	.
and	that	's	johnny	depp	's	shoulder	.
and	that	's	johnny	depp	's	famous	shoulder	tattoo	.
some	of	you	might	know	that	,	in	1990	,	depp	got	 engag 	 ed 	 	to	winona	ryder	,	and	he	had	 tattoo 	 ed 	 	on	his	right	shoulder	``	winona	 fore 	 ver 	 	.	``
and	then	three	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	--	which	in	 fair 	 ness 	 	,	kind	of	is	 fore 	 ver 	 	by	hollywood	 standard 	 s 	 	--	they	broke	up	,	and	johnny	went	and	got	a	little	bit	of	repair	work	 d 	 one 	 	.
and	now	his	shoulder	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	wino	 fore 	 ver 	 	.	``	so	like	johnny	depp	,	and	like	25	percent	of	americans	between	the	 age 	 s 	 	of	16	and	50	,	i	have	a	tattoo	.
i	first	 start 	 ed 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 get 	 ting 	 	it	in	my	mid	-	20s	,	but	i	 de 	 liberate 	 ly 	 	 wait 	 ed 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	long	time	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	all	know	people	who	have	gotten	 tattoo 	 s 	 	when	they	 we 	 re 	 	17	or	19	or	23	and	 regret 	 ted 	 	it	by	the	time	they	 we 	 re 	 	30	.
that	did	n't	happen	to	me	.
i	got	my	tattoo	when	i	was	29	,	and	i	 regret 	 ted 	 	it	 instant 	 ly 	 	.
and	by	``	 regret 	 ted 	 	it	,	``	i	mean	that	i	 steppe 	 d 	 	 out 	 side 	 	of	the	tattoo	place	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	a	couple	 mile 	 s 	 	from	here	down	on	the	lower	east	side	--	and	i	had	a	massive	 emotion 	 al 	 	 melt 	 down 	 	in	broad	 day 	 light 	 	on	the	corner	of	east	broadway	and	 can 	 al 	 	street	.
which	is	a	great	place	to	do	it	 be 	 cause 	 	 no 	 body 	 	 care 	 s 	 	.
and	then	i	went	home	that	night	,	and	i	had	an	even	 large 	 r 	 	 emotion 	 al 	 	 melt 	 down 	 	,	which	i	'll	say	more	about	in	a	minute	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	all	 actual 	 ly 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 shock 	 ing 	 	to	me	,	 be 	 cause 	 	prior	to	 th 	 is 	 	moment	,	i	had	 pri 	 d 	 ed 	 	 my 	 self 	 	on	 hav 	 ing 	 	 absolute 	 ly 	 	no	 regret 	 s 	 	.
i	made	a	lot	of	 mistak 	 es 	 	and	dumb	 decision 	 s 	 	,	of	course	.
i	do	that	 hour 	 ly 	 	.
but	i	had	 al 	 ways 	 	felt	like	,	look	,	you	know	,	i	made	the	best	choice	i	could	make	 give 	 n 	 	who	i	was	then	,	 give 	 n 	 	the	information	i	had	on	hand	.
i	 learn 	 ed 	 	a	 less 	 on 	 	from	it	.
it	 some 	 how 	 	got	me	to	where	i	am	in	life	right	now	.
and	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	i	would	n't	change	it	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	i	had	drunk	our	great	cultural	kool	-	aid	about	regret	,	which	is	that	 lament 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 occur 	 red 	 	in	the	past	is	an	absolute	waste	of	time	,	that	we	should	 al 	 ways 	 	look	forward	and	not	 back 	 ward 	 	,	and	that	one	of	the	 noble 	 st 	 	and	best	 thing 	 s 	 	we	can	do	is	 striv 	 e 	 	to	live	a	life	free	of	 regret 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	idea	is	 nice 	 ly 	 	 capture 	 d 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	quote	:	``	 thing 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	all	 re 	 med 	 y 	 	should	be	 with 	 out 	 	regard	;	what	's	 d 	 one 	 	is	 d 	 one 	 	.	``
and	it	 seem 	 s 	 	like	kind	of	an	 admi 	 r 	 able 	 	 philosoph 	 y 	 	at	first	--	 some 	 thing 	 	we	might	all	agree	to	sign	onto	...
 un 	 til 	 	i	tell	you	who	 s 	 aid 	 	it	.
right	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 lad 	 y 	 	macbeth	 bas 	 ically 	 	 tell 	 ing 	 	her	husband	to	stop	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	a	wuss	for	 feel 	 ing 	 	bad	about	 murder 	 ing 	 	people	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	it	 happen 	 s 	 	,	shakespeare	was	onto	 some 	 thing 	 	here	,	 a 	 s 	 	he	 general 	 ly 	 	was	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	 in 	 ability 	 	to	experience	regret	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	one	of	the	 diagnos 	 tic 	 	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	of	 socio 	 path 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	,	by	the	way	,	a	 character 	 istic 	 	of	certain	 kind 	 s 	 	of	brain	damage	.
so	people	who	have	damage	to	 the 	 ir 	 	orbital	frontal	cortex	seem	to	be	 un 	 able 	 	to	feel	regret	in	the	face	of	even	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	poor	 decision 	 s 	 	.
so	if	,	in	fact	,	you	want	to	live	a	life	free	of	regret	,	there	is	an	option	open	to	you	.	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	a	 lob 	 otomy 	 	.
but	if	you	want	to	be	fully	functional	and	fully	human	and	fully	 human 	 e 	 	,	i	think	you	need	to	learn	to	live	,	not	 with 	 out 	 	regret	,	but	with	it	.
so	let	's	start	off	by	 defi 	 ning 	 	some	 term 	 s 	 	.
what	is	regret	?
regret	is	the	emotion	we	experience	when	we	think	that	our	present	 situ 	 ation 	 	could	be	better	or	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	if	we	had	 d 	 one 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	different	in	the	past	.
so	in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	regret	 requir 	 es 	 	two	 thing 	 s 	 	.
it	 requir 	 es 	 	,	first	of	all	,	 age 	 ncy 	 	--	we	had	to	make	a	decision	in	the	first	place	.
and	second	of	all	,	it	 requir 	 es 	 	 imagin 	 ation 	 	.
we	need	to	be	able	to	imagine	going	back	and	making	a	different	choice	,	and	then	we	need	to	be	able	to	kind	of	 s 	 pool 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 imagin 	 ary 	 	record	forward	and	imagine	how	 thing 	 s 	 	would	be	 play 	 ing 	 	out	in	our	present	.
and	in	fact	,	the	more	we	have	of	either	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	--	the	more	 age 	 ncy 	 	and	the	more	 imagin 	 ation 	 	with	respect	to	a	 give 	 n 	 	regret	,	the	more	 a 	 cute 	 	that	regret	will	be	.
so	let	's	say	for	 in 	 stance 	 	that	you	're	on	your	way	to	your	best	friend	's	 wed 	 d 	 ing 	 	and	you	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	to	the	 air 	 port 	 	and	you	're	 s 	 tuck 	 	in	 terr 	 ible 	 	traffic	,	and	you	 final 	 ly 	 	 arriv 	 e 	 	at	your	gate	and	you	've	 mis 	 s 	 ed 	 	your	flight	.
you	're	going	to	experience	more	regret	in	that	 situ 	 ation 	 	if	you	 mis 	 s 	 ed 	 	your	flight	by	three	 minute 	 s 	 	than	if	you	 mis 	 s 	 ed 	 	it	by	20	.
why	?
well	 be 	 cause 	 	,	if	you	 mis 	 s 	 	your	flight	by	three	 minute 	 s 	 	,	it	is	 pain 	 fully 	 	easy	to	imagine	that	you	could	have	made	different	 decision 	 s 	 	that	would	have	led	to	a	better	 out 	 come 	 	.
``	i	should	have	taken	the	bridge	and	not	the	tunnel	.
i	should	have	gone	through	that	yellow	light	.	``
these	are	the	classic	 condition 	 s 	 	that	create	regret	.
we	feel	regret	when	we	think	we	are	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	a	decision	that	came	out	 bad 	 ly 	 	,	but	 al 	 most 	 	came	out	well	.
now	 with 	 in 	 	that	 frame 	 work 	 	,	we	can	 obvious 	 ly 	 	experience	regret	about	a	lot	of	different	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	session	 to 	 day 	 	is	about	 behavior 	 al 	 	 economic 	 s 	 	.
and	most	of	what	we	know	about	regret	 come 	 s 	 	to	us	out	of	that	domain	.
we	have	a	vast	body	of	 liter 	 ature 	 	on	consumer	and	financial	 decision 	 s 	 	and	the	 regret 	 s 	 	 associate 	 d 	 	with	them	--	 buy 	 er 	 	's	remorse	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	.
but	then	 final 	 ly 	 	,	it	 occur 	 red 	 	to	some	 research 	 ers 	 	to	step	back	and	say	,	well	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	but	 over 	 all 	 	,	what	do	we	regret	most	in	life	?
here	's	what	the	 answer 	 s 	 	turn	out	to	look	like	.
so	top	six	 regret 	 s 	 	--	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	regret	most	in	life	:	number	one	by	far	,	education	.
33	percent	of	all	of	our	 regret 	 s 	 	 per 	 tain 	 	to	 decision 	 s 	 	we	made	about	education	.
we	wish	we	'd	gotten	more	of	it	.
we	wish	we	'd	taken	better	advantage	of	the	education	that	we	did	have	.
we	wish	we	'd	 chose 	 n 	 	to	 stud 	 y 	 	a	different	 top 	 ic 	 	.
 other 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	high	on	our	list	of	 regret 	 s 	 	include	 care 	 er 	 	,	 rom 	 ance 	 	,	 parent 	 ing 	 	,	 vari 	 ous 	 	 decision 	 s 	 	and	 choice 	 s 	 	about	our	sense	of	self	and	how	we	 s 	 pend 	 	our	leisure	time	--	or	 actual 	 ly 	 	more	 specific 	 ally 	 	,	how	we	fail	to	 s 	 pend 	 	our	leisure	time	.
the	 remain 	 ing 	 	 regret 	 s 	 	 per 	 tain 	 	to	these	 thing 	 s 	 	:	finance	,	family	 issue 	 s 	 	 un 	 related 	 	to	 rom 	 ance 	 	or	 parent 	 ing 	 	,	health	,	 friend 	 s 	 	,	 spiritual 	 ity 	 	and	community	.
so	in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	we	know	most	of	what	we	know	about	regret	by	the	 stud 	 y 	 	of	finance	.
but	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	when	you	look	 over 	 all 	 	at	what	people	regret	in	life	,	you	know	what	,	our	financial	 decision 	 s 	 	do	n't	even	rank	.
they	account	for	less	than	three	percent	of	our	total	 regret 	 s 	 	.
so	if	you	're	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	 stress 	 ing 	 	about	large	cap	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	small	cap	,	or	company	a	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	company	b	,	or	should	you	buy	the	subaru	or	the	prius	,	you	know	what	,	let	it	go	.
 odd 	 s 	 	are	,	you	're	not	going	to	care	in	five	 year 	 s 	 	.
but	for	these	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	 re 	 ally 	 	care	about	and	do	experience	 pro 	 found 	 	regret	around	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	that	experience	feel	like	?
we	all	know	the	short	answer	.
it	 feel 	 s 	 	 terr 	 ible 	 	.	regret	 feel 	 s 	 	awful	.
but	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	regret	 feel 	 s 	 	awful	in	four	 ver 	 y 	 	specific	and	 consist 	 ent 	 	ways	.
so	the	first	 consist 	 ent 	 	component	of	regret	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	 deni 	 al 	 	.
when	i	went	home	that	night	after	 get 	 ting 	 	my	tattoo	,	i	 bas 	 ically 	 	 stay 	 ed 	 	up	all	night	.
and	for	the	first	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 hour 	 s 	 	,	there	was	 exact 	 ly 	 	one	thought	in	my	head	.
and	the	thought	was	,	``	make	it	go	away	!	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 un 	 believ 	 ably 	 	primitive	 emotion 	 al 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	.
i	mean	,	it	's	right	up	there	with	,	``	i	want	my	 mom 	 my 	 	!	``
we	're	not	 try 	 ing 	 	to	solve	the	problem	.
we	're	not	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	how	the	problem	came	about	.
we	just	want	it	to	vanish	.
the	second	 character 	 istic 	 	component	of	regret	is	a	sense	of	 be 	 wild 	 er 	 ment 	 	.
so	the	other	thing	i	thought	about	there	in	my	 bed 	 room 	 	that	night	was	,	``	how	could	i	have	 d 	 one 	 	that	?
what	was	i	 think 	 ing 	 	?	``
 th 	 is 	 	real	sense	of	 alien 	 ation 	 	from	the	part	of	us	that	made	a	decision	we	regret	.
we	ca	n't	identify	with	that	part	.
we	do	n't	understand	that	part	.
and	we	 certain 	 ly 	 	do	n't	have	any	 empath 	 y 	 	for	that	part	--	which	 explain 	 s 	 	the	third	 consist 	 ent 	 	component	of	regret	,	which	is	an	 intens 	 e 	 	 desir 	 e 	 	to	punish	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
that	's	why	,	in	the	face	of	our	regret	,	the	thing	we	 consist 	 ent 	 ly 	 	say	is	,	``	i	could	have	 kick 	 ed 	 	 my 	 self 	 	.	``
the	fourth	component	here	is	that	regret	is	what	 psycho 	 logists 	 	call	 persever 	 ative 	 	.
to	 persever 	 ate 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	to	focus	 obsess 	 ively 	 	and	 repeat 	 ed 	 ly 	 	on	the	exact	same	thing	.
now	the	effect	of	 persever 	 ation 	 	is	to	 bas 	 ically 	 	take	these	first	three	 component 	 s 	 	of	regret	and	put	them	on	an	infinite	loop	.
so	it	's	not	that	i	 s 	 at 	 	there	in	my	 bed 	 room 	 	that	night	,	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	make	it	go	away	.	``
it	's	that	i	 s 	 at 	 	there	and	i	thought	,	``	make	it	go	away	.	make	it	go	away	.
make	it	go	away	.	make	it	go	away	.	``
so	if	you	look	at	the	 psycho 	 logical 	 	 liter 	 ature 	 	,	these	are	the	four	 consist 	 ent 	 	 defi 	 ning 	 	 component 	 s 	 	of	regret	.
but	i	want	to	suggest	that	there	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	fifth	one	.
and	i	think	of	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	existential	wake	-	up	call	.
that	night	in	my	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	,	after	i	got	 d 	 one 	 	 kick 	 ing 	 	 my 	 self 	 	and	so	forth	,	i	lay	in	bed	for	a	long	time	,	and	i	thought	about	skin	 graft 	 s 	 	.
and	then	i	thought	about	how	,	much	 a 	 s 	 	travel	 insur 	 ance 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	cover	 act 	 s 	 	of	god	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	my	health	 insur 	 ance 	 	did	not	cover	 act 	 s 	 	of	 idio 	 cy 	 	.
in	point	of	fact	,	no	 insur 	 ance 	 	 cover 	 s 	 	 act 	 s 	 	of	 idio 	 cy 	 	.
the	whole	point	of	 act 	 s 	 	of	 idio 	 cy 	 	is	that	they	 leav 	 e 	 	you	 total 	 ly 	 	 un 	 insur 	 ed 	 	;	they	 leav 	 e 	 	you	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	to	the	world	and	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	to	your	own	 vulner 	 ability 	 	and	 fall 	 ibility 	 	in	face	of	,	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	a	 fair 	 ly 	 	 in 	 different 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 obvious 	 ly 	 	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 pain 	 ful 	 	experience	.
and	i	think	it	's	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 pain 	 ful 	 	for	us	now	in	the	west	in	the	 grip 	 s 	 	of	what	i	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	think	of	 a 	 s 	 	a	control	-	z	culture	--	control	-	z	like	the	computer	command	,	 un 	 do 	 	.
we	're	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	used	to	not	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	face	life	's	hard	 real 	 ities 	 	,	in	a	certain	sense	.
we	think	we	can	throw	money	at	the	problem	or	throw	technology	at	the	problem	--	we	can	 un 	 do 	 	and	 un 	 friend 	 	and	unfollow	.
and	the	problem	is	that	there	are	certain	 thing 	 s 	 	that	happen	in	life	that	we	 desperate 	 ly 	 	want	to	change	and	we	can	not	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	control	-	z	,	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	zero	control	.
and	for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	us	who	are	control	 freak 	 s 	 	and	 perfect 	 ion 	 ists 	 	--	and	i	know	where	of	i	speak	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	want	to	do	 every 	 thing 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	we	want	to	do	it	right	.
now	there	is	a	case	to	be	made	that	control	 freak 	 s 	 	and	 perfect 	 ion 	 ists 	 	should	not	get	 tattoo 	 s 	 	,	and	i	'm	going	to	return	to	that	point	in	a	few	 minute 	 s 	 	.
but	first	i	want	to	say	that	the	 intens 	 ity 	 	and	 persist 	 ence 	 	with	which	we	experience	these	 emotion 	 al 	 	 component 	 s 	 	of	regret	is	 obvious 	 ly 	 	going	to	vary	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	the	specific	thing	that	we	're	 feel 	 ing 	 	 regret 	 ful 	 	about	.
so	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	here	's	one	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 autom 	 atic 	 	 gene 	 rator 	 s 	 	of	regret	in	modern	life	.
text	:	relpy	to	all	.
and	the	 amaz 	 ing 	 	thing	about	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 insid 	 ious 	 	 techno 	 logical 	 	 innov 	 ation 	 	is	that	even	just	with	 th 	 is 	 	one	thing	,	we	can	experience	a	huge	range	of	regret	.
you	can	 accident 	 ally 	 	hit	``	 re 	 ply 	 	all	``	to	an	email	and	torpedo	a	relationship	.
or	you	can	just	have	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 embarrass 	 ing 	 	day	at	work	.
or	you	can	have	your	last	day	at	work	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	even	touch	on	the	 re 	 ally 	 	 pro 	 found 	 	 regret 	 s 	 	of	a	life	.
 be 	 cause 	 	of	course	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	we	do	make	 decision 	 s 	 	that	have	 irrevoc 	 able 	 	and	 terr 	 ible 	 	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	,	either	for	our	own	or	for	other	people	's	health	and	happiness	and	 livelihood 	 s 	 	,	and	in	the	 ver 	 y 	 	worst	case	scenario	,	even	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
now	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 regret 	 s 	 	are	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 pierc 	 ing 	 	and	 endur 	 ing 	 	.
i	mean	,	even	the	stupid	``	 re 	 ply 	 	all	``	 regret 	 s 	 	can	 leav 	 e 	 	us	in	a	fit	of	 excruciat 	 ing 	 	 agon 	 y 	 	for	 day 	 s 	 	.
so	how	are	we	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	live	with	 th 	 is 	 	?
i	want	to	suggest	that	there	's	three	 thing 	 s 	 	that	help	us	to	make	our	peace	with	regret	.
and	the	first	of	these	is	to	take	some	comfort	in	 it 	 s 	 	 universal 	 ity 	 	.
if	you	google	regret	and	tattoo	,	you	will	get	11.5	million	 hit 	 s 	 	.
the	fda	 estimate 	 s 	 	that	of	all	the	americans	who	have	 tattoo 	 s 	 	,	17	percent	of	us	regret	 get 	 ting 	 	them	.
that	is	johnny	depp	and	me	and	our	seven	million	 friend 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	just	regret	about	 tattoo 	 s 	 	.
we	are	all	in	 th 	 is 	 	together	.
the	second	way	that	we	can	help	make	our	peace	with	regret	is	to	laugh	at	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
now	in	my	case	,	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	was	n't	a	problem	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	to	laugh	at	 your 	 self 	 	when	you	're	29	 year 	 s 	 	old	and	you	want	your	 mom 	 my 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	you	do	n't	like	your	new	tattoo	.
but	it	might	seem	like	a	kind	of	cruel	or	glib	 suggest 	 ion 	 	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	these	more	 pro 	 found 	 	 regret 	 s 	 	.
i	do	n't	think	that	's	the	case	 th 	 ough 	 	.
all	of	us	who	've	 experience 	 d 	 	regret	that	 contain 	 s 	 	real	pain	and	real	grief	understand	that	humor	and	even	black	humor	 play 	 s 	 	a	 cruci 	 al 	 	role	in	 help 	 ing 	 	us	 surviv 	 e 	 	.
it	 connect 	 s 	 	the	 pole 	 s 	 	of	our	 live 	 s 	 	back	together	,	the	positive	and	the	negative	,	and	it	 s 	 end 	 s 	 	a	little	current	of	life	back	 in 	 to 	 	us	.
the	third	way	that	i	think	we	can	help	make	our	peace	with	regret	is	through	the	 pass 	 age 	 	of	time	,	which	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	know	,	 heal 	 s 	 	all	 wound 	 s 	 	--	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	 tattoo 	 s 	 	,	which	are	permanent	.
so	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 year 	 s 	 	since	i	got	my	own	tattoo	.
and	do	you	 guy 	 s 	 	just	want	to	see	it	?
all	right	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	you	know	what	,	i	should	 war 	 n 	 	you	,	you	're	going	to	be	 disappoint 	 ed 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	not	that	 hide 	 ous 	 	.
i	did	n't	tattoo	marilyn	manson	's	face	on	some	 in 	 discreet 	 	part	of	 my 	 self 	 	or	 some 	 thing 	 	.
when	other	people	see	my	tattoo	,	for	the	most	part	they	like	how	it	 look 	 s 	 	.
it	's	just	that	i	do	n't	like	how	it	 look 	 s 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	,	i	'm	a	 perfect 	 ion 	 ist 	 	.
but	i	'll	let	you	see	it	 any 	 way 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	my	tattoo	.
i	can	guess	what	some	of	you	are	 think 	 ing 	 	.
so	let	me	 re 	 assure 	 	you	about	 some 	 thing 	 	.
some	of	your	own	 regret 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 so 	 	not	 a 	 s 	 	 ug 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	think	they	are	.
i	got	 th 	 is 	 	tattoo	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 s 	 pent 	 	most	of	my	20s	living	 out 	 side 	 	the	country	and	 travel 	 ing 	 	.
and	when	i	came	and	 settl 	 ed 	 	in	new	york	 after 	 ward 	 	,	i	was	 worri 	 ed 	 	that	i	would	forget	some	of	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	that	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	that	time	.
 specific 	 ally 	 	the	two	 thing 	 s 	 	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	about	 my 	 self 	 	that	i	most	did	n't	want	to	forget	was	how	 import 	 ant 	 	it	felt	to	keep	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	and	,	 simultaneous 	 ly 	 	,	how	 import 	 ant 	 	it	is	to	 some 	 how 	 	keep	an	eye	on	your	own	true	north	.
and	what	i	 love 	 d 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	image	of	the	compass	was	that	i	felt	like	it	 encapsul 	 ated 	 	both	of	these	 idea 	 s 	 	in	one	simple	image	.
and	i	thought	it	might	serve	 a 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	permanent	mnemonic	 de 	 vice 	 	.
well	it	did	.
but	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 mind 	 	me	of	the	thing	i	thought	it	would	;
it	 re 	 mind 	 s 	 	me	 constant 	 ly 	 	of	 some 	 thing 	 	else	 in 	 stead 	 	.
it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 re 	 mind 	 s 	 	me	of	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 less 	 on 	 	regret	can	teach	us	,	which	is	 al 	 so 	 	one	of	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	life	 teach 	 es 	 	us	.
and	 iron 	 ically 	 	,	i	think	it	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	single	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	i	possibly	could	have	 tattoo 	 ed 	 	onto	my	body	--	 part 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	writer	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	just	 a 	 s 	 	a	human	 be 	 ing 	 	.
here	's	the	thing	,
if	we	have	 goal 	 s 	 	and	 dream 	 s 	 	,	and	we	want	to	do	our	best	,	and	if	we	love	people	and	we	do	n't	want	to	hurt	them	or	lose	them	,	we	should	feel	pain	when	 thing 	 s 	 	go	wrong	.
the	point	is	n't	to	live	 with 	 out 	 	any	 regret 	 s 	 	.
the	point	is	to	not	hate	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	for	 hav 	 ing 	 	them	.
the	 less 	 on 	 	that	i	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	my	tattoo	and	that	i	want	to	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	 to 	 day 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	we	need	to	learn	to	love	the	 flaw 	 ed 	 	,	 im 	 perfect 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	create	and	to	forgive	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	for	creating	them	.
regret	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 mind 	 	us	that	we	did	 bad 	 ly 	 	.
it	 re 	 mind 	 s 	 	us	that	we	know	we	can	do	better	.
thank	you	.
