when	i	 k 	 new 	 	i	was	going	to	come	to	speak	to	you	,	i	thought	,	``	i	got	ta	call	my	mother	.	``

i	 call 	 ed 	 	her	up	.	``	 hell 	 o 	 	,	how	're	you	 do 	 ing 	 	,	baby	?	``
``	 he 	 y 	 	,	ma	,	i	got	to	talk	to	you	.	``
``	you	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	me	 al 	 ready 	 	.	what	's	the	matter	?	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	've	got	to	talk	to	a	bunch	of	nice	people	.	``
``	you	're	 al 	 ways 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	nice	people	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	when	you	went	to	the	white	house	.	``	``	ma	,	do	n't	start	!	``
and	i	told	her	i	was	coming	to	ted	,	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	's	the	problem	?	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	.	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	have	to	talk	to	them	about	 st 	 ories 	 	.
it	's	'	technology	,	 entertain 	 ment 	 	and	design	.	'	``
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	you	design	a	story	when	you	make	it	up	,	it	's	 entertain 	 ment 	 	when	you	tell	it	,	and	you	're	going	to	use	a	 micro 	 phone 	 	.	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	're	a	peach	,	ma	.	pop	there	?	``
``	what	's	the	matter	?	the	 pearl 	 s 	 	of	 wis 	 dom 	 	 leap 	 ing 	 	from	my	lips	like	lemmings	is	no	good	for	you	?	``
then	my	pop	got	on	there	.
my	pop	,	he	's	one	of	the	old	 soul 	 s 	 	,	you	know	--	old	cuban	man	from	camaguey	.
camaguey	is	a	 pro 	 vince 	 	in	cuba	.
he	's	from	florida	.
he	was	born	there	in	1924	.
he	grew	up	in	a	bohio	of	dirt	 floor 	 s 	 	,	and	the	structure	was	the	kind	used	by	the	tainos	,	our	old	arawak	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	.	my	father	is	at	once	quick	-	witted	,	wickedly	funny	,	and	then	poignancy	 turn 	 s 	 	on	a	 di 	 me 	 	and	 leav 	 es 	 	you	breathless	.
``	papi	,	help	.	``
``	i	 al 	 ready 	 	heard	your	mother	.	i	think	she	's	right	.	``
``	after	what	i	just	told	you	?	``
my	whole	life	,	my	father	's	 be 	 en 	 	there	.
so	we	 talk 	 ed 	 	for	a	few	 minute 	 s 	 	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	why	do	n't	you	tell	them	what	you	 believ 	 e 	 	?	``
i	love	that	,	but	we	do	n't	have	the	time	.
good	 story 	 tell 	 ing 	 	is	 craft 	 ing 	 	a	story	that	 some 	 one 	 	 want 	 s 	 	to	listen	to	.
great	story	is	the	art	of	 lett 	 ing 	 	go	.
so	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	a	little	story	.
remember	,	 th 	 is 	 	tradition	 come 	 s 	 	to	us	not	from	the	mists	of	avalon	,	back	in	time	,	but	further	still	,	before	we	 we 	 re 	 	 scratch 	 ing 	 	out	these	 st 	 ories 	 	on	papyrus	,	or	we	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	the	 pic 	 to 	 graph 	 s 	 	on	 wall 	 s 	 	in	moist	,	 dam 	 p 	 	 cave 	 s 	 	.
back	then	,	we	had	an	urge	,	a	need	,	to	tell	the	story	.
when	lexus	 want 	 s 	 	to	sell	you	a	car	,	they	're	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	a	story	.
have	you	 be 	 en 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	the	 commercial 	 s 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	every	one	of	us	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 desir 	 e 	 	,	for	once	--	just	once	--	to	tell	our	story	and	have	it	heard	.
there	are	 st 	 ories 	 	you	tell	from	 stage 	 s 	 	.
there	's	 st 	 ories 	 	that	you	may	tell	in	a	small	group	of	people	with	some	good	wine	.
and	there	's	 st 	 ories 	 	you	tell	late	at	night	to	a	friend	,	 may 	 be 	 	once	in	your	life	.
and	then	there	are	 st 	 ories 	 	that	we	whisper	 in 	 to 	 	a	stygian	 dark 	 ness 	 	.
i	'm	not	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	that	story	.
i	'm	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	,	``	you	're	going	to	 mis 	 s 	 	me	.	``
it	's	about	human	 connect 	 ion 	 	.

we	went	from	havana	,	cuba	to	decatur	,	georgia	.
