if	you	take	10,000	people	at	random	,	9,999	have	 some 	 thing 	 	in	common	:	 the 	 ir 	 	 interest 	 s 	 	in	business	lie	on	or	near	the	earth	's	surface	.
the	odd	one	out	is	an	astronomer	,	and	i	am	one	of	that	strange	breed	.
my	talk	will	be	in	two	 part 	 s 	 	.	i	'll	talk	first	 a 	 s 	 	an	astronomer	,	and	then	 a 	 s 	 	a	 worri 	 ed 	 	member	of	the	human	race	.
but	let	's	start	off	by	 remember 	 ing 	 	that	darwin	 show 	 ed 	 	how	we	're	the	 out 	 come 	 	of	four	billion	 year 	 s 	 	of	evolution	.
and	what	we	try	to	do	in	 astro 	 nomy 	 	and	 cosmo 	 logy 	 	is	to	go	back	before	darwin	's	simple	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	to	set	our	earth	in	a	 cosm 	 ic 	 	 con 	 text 	 	.
and	let	me	just	run	through	a	few	 slide 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	the	impact	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	last	week	on	a	 com 	 et 	 	.
if	they	'd	 s 	 ent 	 	a	nuke	,	it	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	more	spectacular	than	what	 actual 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	last	monday	.
so	that	's	 an 	 other 	 	project	for	nasa	.
that	's	mars	from	the	european	mars	express	,	and	at	new	year	.
 th 	 is 	 	artist	's	impression	 turn 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	when	a	 parachut 	 e 	 	 land 	 ed 	 	on	titan	,	saturn	's	giant	moon	.
it	 land 	 ed 	 	on	the	surface	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 picture 	 s 	 	taken	on	the	way	down	.
that	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	 coast 	 line 	 	.
it	is	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	but	the	ocean	is	liquid	 m 	 ethane 	 	--	the	temperature	minus	170	 degree 	 s 	 	 cent 	 i 	 grade 	 	.
if	we	go	beyond	our	solar	system	,	we	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	the	 star 	 s 	 	are	n't	 twinkl 	 y 	 	 point 	 s 	 	of	light	.
each	one	is	like	a	 s 	 un 	 	with	a	 re 	 tinue 	 	of	 planet 	 s 	 	 orbit 	 ing 	 	around	it	.	and	we	can	see	 place 	 s 	 	where	 star 	 s 	 	are	 form 	 ing 	 	,	like	the	eagle	 nebul 	 a 	 	.	we	see	 star 	 s 	 	 dy 	 ing 	 	.
in	six	billion	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	 s 	 un 	 	will	look	like	that	.
and	some	 star 	 s 	 	die	 spectacular 	 ly 	 	in	a	supernova	explosion	,	 leav 	 ing 	 	 remnant 	 s 	 	like	that	.
on	a	still	 big 	 ger 	 	scale	,	we	see	entire	 galax 	 ies 	 	of	 star 	 s 	 	.
we	see	entire	 eco 	 system 	 s 	 	where	gas	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 recycl 	 ed 	 	.
and	to	the	 cosmo 	 logist 	 	,	these	 galax 	 ies 	 	are	just	the	 atom 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 we 	 re 	 	,	of	the	large	-	scale	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	picture	 show 	 s 	 	a	patch	of	sky	so	small	that	it	would	take	about	100	 patch 	 es 	 	like	it	to	cover	the	full	moon	in	the	sky	.
through	a	small	 tele 	 scope 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	would	look	 quit 	 e 	 	blank	,
but	you	see	here	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	little	,	faint	 smudg 	 es 	 	.
each	is	a	 galax 	 y 	 	,	fully	like	 our 	 s 	 	or	andromeda	,	which	 look 	 s 	 	so	small	and	faint	 be 	 cause 	 	 it 	 s 	 	light	 ha 	 s 	 	taken	10	billion	light	-	 year 	 s 	 	to	get	to	us	.
the	 star 	 s 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 galax 	 ies 	 	 prob 	 ably 	 	do	n't	have	 planet 	 s 	 	around	them	.
there	's	 s 	 cant 	 	chance	of	life	there	--	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	no	time	for	the	nuclear	fusion	in	 star 	 s 	 	to	make	silicon	and	carbon	and	iron	,	the	building	 block 	 s 	 	of	 planet 	 s 	 	and	of	life	.
we	 believ 	 e 	 	that	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	 emerge 	 d 	 	from	a	big	bang	--	a	hot	,	dense	state	.	so	how	did	that	 a 	 morpho 	 us 	 	big	bang	turn	 in 	 to 	 	our	complex	 cosmo 	 s 	 	?
i	'm	going	to	show	you	a	movie	 simul 	 ation 	 	16	 power 	 s 	 	of	10	 fast 	 er 	 	than	real	time	,	which	 show 	 s 	 	a	patch	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	where	the	 expansion 	 s 	 	have	 subtract 	 ed 	 	out	.
but	you	see	,	 a 	 s 	 	time	 go 	 es 	 	on	in	 giga 	 year 	 s 	 	at	the	bottom	,	you	will	see	 structure 	 s 	 	evolve	 a 	 s 	 	 gravit 	 y 	 	 feed 	 s 	 	on	small	,	dense	 ir 	 regular 	 ities 	 	,	and	 structure 	 s 	 	develop	.
and	we	'll	end	up	after	13	billion	 year 	 s 	 	with	 some 	 thing 	 	looking	 ra 	 ther 	 	like	our	own	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
and	we	 compar 	 e 	 	 simul 	 ated 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 s 	 	like	that	--	i	'll	show	you	a	better	 simul 	 ation 	 	at	the	end	of	my	talk	--	with	what	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	in	the	sky	.
well	,	we	can	trace	 thing 	 s 	 	back	to	the	 ear 	 lier 	 	 stage 	 s 	 	of	the	big	bang	,	but	we	still	do	n't	know	what	 bang 	 ed 	 	and	why	it	 bang 	 ed 	 	.
that	's	a	 challeng 	 e 	 	for	21st	-	century	science	.
if	my	research	group	had	a	logo	,	it	would	be	 th 	 is 	 	picture	here	:	an	ouroboros	,	where	you	see	the	micro	-	world	on	the	left	--	the	world	of	the	 quant 	 um 	 	--	and	on	the	right	the	large	-	scale	 uni 	 verse 	 	of	 planet 	 s 	 	,	 star 	 s 	 	and	 galax 	 ies 	 	.
we	know	our	 uni 	 verse 	 s 	 	are	 unit 	 ed 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	--	 link 	 s 	 	between	left	and	right	.
the	 every 	 day 	 	world	is	 determine 	 d 	 	by	 atom 	 s 	 	,	how	they	stick	together	to	make	 molecule 	 s 	 	.
 star 	 s 	 	are	 fuel 	 ed 	 	by	how	the	nuclei	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 atom 	 s 	 	react	together	.
and	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	in	the	last	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	 galax 	 ies 	 	are	held	together	by	the	 gravit 	 ation 	 al 	 	pull	of	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	dark	matter	:	 particle 	 s 	 	in	huge	 s 	 warm 	 s 	 	,	far	 small 	 er 	 	even	than	atomic	nuclei	.
but	we	'd	like	to	know	the	synthesis	 symbol 	 ized 	 	at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	top	.
the	micro	-	world	of	the	 quant 	 um 	 	is	 under 	 stood 	 	.
on	the	right	hand	side	,	 gravit 	 y 	 	 hold 	 s 	 	 s 	 way 	 	.	einstein	 explain 	 ed 	 	that	.
but	the	 un 	 finish 	 ed 	 	business	for	21st	-	century	science	is	to	link	together	 cosmo 	 s 	 	and	micro	-	world	with	a	 un 	 ified 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	--	 symbol 	 ized 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 we 	 re 	 	,	 gastronomic 	 ally 	 	at	the	top	of	that	picture	.
and	 un 	 til 	 	we	have	that	synthesis	,	we	wo	n't	be	able	to	understand	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	our	 uni 	 verse 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	when	our	 uni 	 verse 	 	was	 it 	 self 	 	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	an	atom	,	 quant 	 um 	 	 effect 	 s 	 	could	shake	 every 	 thing 	 	.
and	so	we	need	a	 theor 	 y 	 	that	 un 	 ifies 	 	the	 ver 	 y 	 	large	and	the	 ver 	 y 	 	small	,	which	we	do	n't	yet	have	.
one	idea	,	 incident 	 ally 	 	--	and	i	had	 th 	 is 	 	hazard	sign	to	say	i	'm	going	to	 specul 	 ate 	 	from	now	on	--	is	that	our	big	bang	was	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	one	.
one	idea	is	that	our	three	-	dimensional	 uni 	 verse 	 	may	be	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	in	a	high	-	dimensional	space	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	imagine	on	these	 sheet 	 s 	 	of	paper	.
you	can	imagine	ants	on	one	of	them	 think 	 ing 	 	it	's	a	two	-	dimensional	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	not	 be 	 ing 	 	aware	of	 an 	 other 	 	population	of	ants	on	the	other	.
so	there	could	be	 an 	 other 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	just	a	millimeter	away	from	 our 	 s 	 	,	but	we	're	not	aware	of	it	 be 	 cause 	 	that	millimeter	is	 measur 	 ed 	 	in	some	fourth	spatial	dimension	,	and	we	're	 imprison 	 ed 	 	in	our	three	.
and	so	we	 believ 	 e 	 	that	there	may	be	a	lot	more	to	physical	 re 	 ality 	 	than	what	we	've	 normal 	 ly 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	our	 uni 	 verse 	 	--	the	 after 	 math 	 	of	our	big	bang	.	and	here	's	 an 	 other 	 	picture	.
bottom	right	 depict 	 s 	 	our	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	which	on	the	horizon	is	not	beyond	that	,	but	even	that	is	just	one	bubble	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 we 	 re 	 	,	in	some	 vast 	 er 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	.
 man 	 y 	 	people	suspect	that	just	 a 	 s 	 	we	've	gone	from	 believ 	 ing 	 	in	one	solar	system	to	 zillion 	 s 	 	of	solar	 system 	 s 	 	,	one	 galax 	 y 	 	to	 man 	 y 	 	 galax 	 ies 	 	,	we	have	to	go	to	 man 	 y 	 	big	 bang 	 s 	 	from	one	big	bang	,
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	these	 man 	 y 	 	big	 bang 	 s 	 	 dis 	 play 	 ing 	 	an	immense	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 proper 	 ties 	 	.
well	,	let	's	go	back	to	 th 	 is 	 	picture	.
there	's	one	 challeng 	 e 	 	 symbol 	 ized 	 	at	the	top	,	but	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	 challeng 	 e 	 	to	science	 symbol 	 ized 	 	at	the	bottom	.
you	want	to	not	 on 	 ly 	 	synthesize	the	 ver 	 y 	 	large	and	the	 ver 	 y 	 	small	,	but	we	want	to	understand	the	 ver 	 y 	 	complex	.
and	the	most	complex	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	 mid 	 way 	 	between	 atom 	 s 	 	and	 star 	 s 	 	.
we	depend	on	 star 	 s 	 	to	make	the	 atom 	 s 	 	we	're	made	of	.
we	depend	on	 chemist 	 ry 	 	to	determine	our	complex	structure	.
we	 clear 	 ly 	 	have	to	be	large	,	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	 atom 	 s 	 	,	to	have	layer	 up 	 on 	 	layer	of	complex	structure	.
we	 clear 	 ly 	 	have	to	be	small	,	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	 star 	 s 	 	and	 planet 	 s 	 	--	 other 	 wise 	 	we	'd	be	 crush 	 ed 	 	by	 gravit 	 y 	 	.	and	in	fact	,	we	are	 mid 	 way 	 	.
it	would	take	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	human	bodies	to	make	up	the	 s 	 un 	 	 a 	 s 	 	there	are	 atom 	 s 	 	in	each	of	us	.
the	 geo 	 metric 	 	mean	of	the	mass	of	a	proton	and	the	mass	of	the	 s 	 un 	 	is	50	 kilo 	 gram 	 s 	 	,	 with 	 in 	 	a	factor	of	two	of	the	mass	of	each	person	here	.
well	,	most	of	you	 any 	 way 	 	.
the	science	of	 complex 	 ity 	 	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	 great 	 est 	 	 challeng 	 e 	 	of	all	,	 great 	 er 	 	than	that	of	the	 ver 	 y 	 	small	on	the	left	and	the	 ver 	 y 	 	large	on	the	right	.
and	it	's	 th 	 is 	 	science	,	which	is	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 enlighten 	 ing 	 	our	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	the	 bio 	 logical 	 	world	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 transform 	 ing 	 	our	world	 fast 	 er 	 	than	ever	.
and	more	than	that	,	it	's	 en 	 gender 	 ing 	 	new	 kind 	 s 	 	of	change	.
and	i	now	move	on	to	the	second	part	of	my	talk	,	and	the	book	``	our	final	century	``	was	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	.
if	i	was	not	a	self	-	effacing	brit	,	i	would	 ment 	 ion 	 	the	book	 my 	 self 	 	,	and	i	would	add	that	it	's	 avail 	 able 	 	in	 paper 	 back 	 	.
and	in	america	it	was	 call 	 ed 	 	``	our	final	hour	``	 be 	 cause 	 	americans	like	instant	 grat 	 ification 	 	.
but	my	theme	is	that	in	 th 	 is 	 	century	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	science	 change 	 d 	 	the	world	 fast 	 er 	 	than	ever	,	but	in	new	and	different	ways	.
 target 	 ed 	 	 drug 	 s 	 	,	genetic	 mod 	 ification 	 	,	artificial	 intellig 	 ence 	 	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	even	 implant 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	our	 brain 	 s 	 	,	may	change	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.	and	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 phy 	 s 	 ique 	 	and	character	,	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 change 	 d 	 	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
it	may	change	 th 	 is 	 	century	.
it	's	new	in	our	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
and	the	human	impact	on	the	global	environment	--	 green 	 house 	 	 warm 	 ing 	 	,	mass	 extinct 	 ions 	 	and	so	forth	--	is	unprecedented	,	too	.
and	so	,	 th 	 is 	 	 make 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	coming	century	a	 challeng 	 e 	 	.
bio	-	and	 cyber 	 techno 	 logies 	 	are	 environment 	 ally 	 	benign	in	that	they	 off 	 er 	 	 marvel 	 ous 	 	 prospect 	 s 	 	,	while	,	 non 	 e 	 the 	 less 	 	,	 reduc 	 ing 	 	pressure	on	energy	and	 resource 	 s 	 	.
but	they	will	have	a	dark	side	.
in	our	 interconnect 	 ed 	 	world	,	novel	technology	could	empower	just	one	fanatic	,	or	some	 weird 	 o 	 	with	a	 mind 	 set 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	who	now	design	computer	viruses	,	to	trigger	some	kind	on	disaster	.
 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	 catastroph 	 e 	 	could	arise	 simpl 	 y 	 	from	technical	 mis 	 adventure 	 	--	error	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	terror	.
and	even	a	 tin 	 y 	 	 prob 	 ability 	 	of	 catastroph 	 e 	 	is	 un 	 accept 	 able 	 	when	the	 down 	 side 	 	could	be	of	global	 con 	 sequence 	 	.
in	fact	,	some	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	bill	joy	wrote	an	article	 express 	 ing 	 	tremendous	concern	about	 robot 	 s 	 	taking	us	over	,	etc	.
i	do	n't	go	 a 	 long 	 	with	all	that	,	but	it	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	that	he	had	a	simple	solution	.
it	was	what	he	 call 	 ed 	 	``	fine	-	grained	 relinquish 	 ment 	 	.	``
he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	give	up	the	 danger 	 ous 	 	kind	of	science	and	keep	the	good	bits	.	now	,	that	's	 absurd 	 ly 	 	naive	for	two	 reason 	 s 	 	.
first	,	any	scientific	 discover 	 y 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	benign	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	 one 	 s 	 	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	,	when	a	scientist	 make 	 s 	 	a	 discover 	 y 	 	,	he	or	she	 normal 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	no	clue	what	the	 application 	 s 	 	are	going	to	be	.
and	so	what	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	is	that	we	have	to	accept	the	 risk 	 s 	 	if	we	are	going	to	enjoy	the	 benefit 	 s 	 	of	science	.
we	have	to	accept	that	there	will	be	 hazard 	 s 	 	.
and	i	think	we	have	to	go	back	to	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	post	-	war	era	,	post	-	world	war	ii	,	when	the	nuclear	 scientist 	 s 	 	who	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	making	the	atomic	bomb	,	in	 man 	 y 	 	 case 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 concern 	 ed 	 	that	they	should	do	all	they	could	to	alert	the	world	to	the	 danger 	 s 	 	.
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	inspired	not	by	the	young	einstein	,	who	did	the	great	work	in	 relat 	 ivity 	 	,	but	by	the	old	einstein	,	the	icon	of	 post 	 er 	 	and	t	-	shirt	,	who	 fail 	 ed 	 	in	his	scientific	 effort 	 s 	 	to	 un 	 ify 	 	the	physical	 law 	 s 	 	.
he	was	 pre 	 mature 	 	.	but	he	was	a	moral	compass	--	an	inspiration	to	 scientist 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	 concern 	 ed 	 	with	 arm 	 s 	 	control	.
and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	the	 great 	 est 	 	living	person	is	 some 	 one 	 	i	'm	 privilege 	 d 	 	to	know	,	joe	rothblatt	.
 equal 	 ly 	 	 un 	 tidy 	 	 off 	 ice 	 	there	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	.
he	's	96	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	and	he	 found 	 ed 	 	the	pugwash	 move 	 ment 	 	.
he	 persuad 	 ed 	 	einstein	,	 a 	 s 	 	his	last	act	,	to	sign	the	famous	 memor 	 and 	 um 	 	of	bertrand	russell	.
and	he	 set 	 s 	 	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	the	 concern 	 ed 	 	scientist	.
and	i	think	to	harness	science	 optimal 	 ly 	 	,	to	 choos 	 e 	 	which	 door 	 s 	 	to	open	and	which	to	 leav 	 e 	 	closed	,	we	need	 lat 	 ter 	 	-	day	 counter 	 part 	 s 	 	of	people	like	joseph	rothblatt	.
we	need	not	just	 campaign 	 ing 	 	 physicist 	 s 	 	,	but	we	need	 biologist 	 s 	 	,	computer	 expert 	 s 	 	and	 environment 	 alist 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
and	i	think	 academic 	 s 	 	and	 in 	 dependent 	 	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	have	a	special	 oblig 	 ation 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	have	more	 free 	 dom 	 	than	 t 	 hose 	 	in	government	service	,	or	company	 employ 	 ees 	 	subject	to	commercial	pressure	.
i	wrote	my	book	,	``	our	final	century	,	``	 a 	 s 	 	a	scientist	,	just	a	general	scientist	.	but	there	's	one	respect	,	i	think	,	in	which	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 cosmo 	 logist 	 	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	a	special	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	and	that	's	that	it	 off 	 ers 	 	an	 aware 	 ness 	 	of	the	immense	future	.
the	stupendous	time	 span 	 s 	 	of	the	 evolution 	 ary 	 	past	are	now	part	of	common	culture	--	 out 	 side 	 	the	american	 b 	 ible 	 	belt	,	 any 	 way 	 	--	but	most	people	,	even	 t 	 hose 	 	who	are	familiar	with	evolution	,	are	n't	 mind 	 ful 	 	that	even	more	time	lies	 a 	 head 	 	.
the	 s 	 un 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 shin 	 ing 	 	for	four	and	a	half	billion	 year 	 s 	 	,	but	it	'll	be	 an 	 other 	 	six	billion	 year 	 s 	 	before	 it 	 s 	 	fuel	 run 	 s 	 	out	.
on	that	schematic	picture	,	a	sort	of	time	-	lapse	picture	,	we	're	 half 	 way 	 	.
and	it	'll	be	 an 	 other 	 	six	billion	before	that	 happen 	 s 	 	,	and	any	 remain 	 ing 	 	life	on	earth	is	 vapor 	 ized 	 	.

if	you	represent	the	earth	's	 life 	 time 	 	by	a	single	year	,	say	from	january	when	it	was	made	to	december	,	the	21st	-	century	would	be	a	quarter	of	a	second	in	june	--	a	 tin 	 y 	 	fraction	of	the	year	.
