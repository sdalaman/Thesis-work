 to 	 day 	 	,	i	want	you	to	look	at	children	who	 be 	 come 	 	 su 	 icide 	 	 bomb 	 ers 	 	through	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	lens	.
in	2009	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	500	bomb	 blast 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	pakistan	.
i	 s 	 pent 	 	the	year	 work 	 ing 	 	with	children	who	 we 	 re 	 	training	to	 be 	 come 	 	 su 	 icide 	 	 bomb 	 ers 	 	and	with	taliban	 recruit 	 ers 	 	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	how	the	taliban	 we 	 re 	 	 convert 	 ing 	 	these	children	 in 	 to 	 	live	 am 	 mun 	 ition 	 	and	why	these	children	 we 	 re 	 	 active 	 ly 	 	 sign 	 ing 	 	up	to	 the 	 ir 	 	cause	.
i	want	you	to	watch	a	short	video	from	my	 lat 	 est 	 	 document 	 ary 	 	film	,	``	children	of	the	taliban	.	``
the	taliban	now	run	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 school 	 s 	 	.
they	target	poor	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	and	 con 	 vince 	 	the	 parent 	 s 	 	to	 s 	 end 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	children	.
in	return	,	they	provide	free	food	and	shelter	and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	pay	the	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	a	 month 	 ly 	 	stipend	.
we	've	 obtain 	 ed 	 	a	 propag 	 and 	 a 	 	video	made	by	the	taliban	.
young	 boy 	 s 	 	are	taught	 just 	 ification 	 s 	 	for	 su 	 icide 	 	 attack 	 s 	 	and	the	 exec 	 ution 	 	of	 s 	 pies 	 	.
i	made	contact	with	a	child	from	swat	who	 stud 	 ied 	 	in	a	 ma 	 dra 	 s 	 s 	 a 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
hazrat	ali	is	from	a	poor	 farm 	 ing 	 	family	in	swat	.
he	 join 	 ed 	 	the	taliban	a	year	ago	when	he	was	13	.
how	do	the	taliban	in	your	area	get	people	to	join	them	?
hazrat	ali	:	they	first	call	us	to	the	mosque	and	preach	to	us	.
then	they	take	us	to	a	 ma 	 dra 	 s 	 s 	 a 	 	and	teach	us	 thing 	 s 	 	from	the	koran	.
sharmeen	obaid	chinoy	:	he	 tell 	 s 	 	me	that	children	are	then	 give 	 n 	 	 month 	 s 	 	of	 militar 	 y 	 	training	.
ha	:	they	teach	us	to	use	machine	 gun 	 s 	 	,	kalashnikov	,	rocket	 launch 	 ers 	 	,	 grenade 	 s 	 	,	 bomb 	 s 	 	.
they	ask	us	to	use	them	 on 	 ly 	 	against	the	 infidel 	 s 	 	.
then	they	teach	us	to	do	a	 su 	 icide 	 	attack	.
soc	:	would	you	like	to	carry	out	a	 su 	 icide 	 	attack	?
ha	:	if	god	 give 	 s 	 	me	strength	.
soc	:	i	,	in	my	research	,	have	 s 	 een 	 	that	the	taliban	have	 perfect 	 ed 	 	the	way	in	which	they	recruit	and	train	children	,
and	i	think	it	's	a	five	-	step	process	.
step	one	is	that	the	taliban	 pre 	 y 	 	on	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	that	are	large	,	that	are	poor	,	that	live	in	 r 	 ural 	 	 area 	 s 	 	.
they	 separat 	 e 	 	the	 parent 	 s 	 	from	the	children	by	promising	to	provide	food	,	 cloth 	 ing 	 	,	shelter	to	these	children	.
then	they	ship	them	off	,	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 mile 	 s 	 	away	to	hard	-	line	 school 	 s 	 	that	run	 a 	 long 	 	the	taliban	agenda	.
step	two	:
they	teach	the	children	the	koran	,	which	is	islam	's	 holi 	 est 	 	book	,	in	arabic	,	a	language	these	children	do	not	understand	and	can	not	speak	.
they	 re 	 ly 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 heav 	 ily 	 	on	 teacher 	 s 	 	,	who	i	have	 personal 	 ly 	 	 s 	 een 	 	distort	the	 mess 	 age 	 	to	these	children	 a 	 s 	 	and	when	it	 suit 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	purpose	to	.
these	children	are	 ex 	 plicit 	 ly 	 	 forbid 	 den 	 	from	 read 	 ing 	 	 news 	 paper 	 s 	 	,	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	radio	,	 read 	 ing 	 	any	 book 	 s 	 	that	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	do	not	 pre 	 scribe 	 	them	.
if	any	child	is	found	 viol 	 ating 	 	these	 rule 	 s 	 	,	he	is	 severe 	 ly 	 	 reprimand 	 ed 	 	.
 effective 	 ly 	 	,	the	taliban	create	a	complete	 black 	 out 	 	of	any	other	source	of	information	for	these	children	.
step	three	:	the	taliban	want	these	children	to	hate	the	world	that	they	 current 	 ly 	 	live	in	.
so	they	beat	these	children	--
i	have	 s 	 een 	 	it	;
they	feed	them	twice	a	day	dried	bread	and	water	;
they	 rare 	 ly 	 	allow	them	to	play	 game 	 s 	 	;
they	tell	them	that	,	for	eight	 hour 	 s 	 	at	a	time	,	all	they	have	to	do	is	read	the	koran	.
the	children	are	virtual	 prisoner 	 s 	 	;
they	can	not	 leav 	 e 	 	,	they	can	not	go	home	.
 the 	 ir 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	are	so	poor	,	they	have	no	 resource 	 s 	 	to	get	them	back	.
step	four	:	the	 old 	 er 	 	 member 	 s 	 	of	the	taliban	,	the	 fight 	 ers 	 	,	start	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	the	 young 	 er 	 	 boy 	 s 	 	about	the	 glor 	 ies 	 	of	 martyr 	 dom 	 	.
they	talk	to	them	about	how	when	they	die	,	they	will	be	 receiv 	 ed 	 	up	with	 lake 	 s 	 	of	honey	and	milk	,	how	there	will	be	72	 virgin 	 s 	 	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	them	in	 para 	 dis 	 e 	 	,	how	there	will	be	 un 	 limit 	 ed 	 	food	,	and	how	 th 	 is 	 	 glor 	 y 	 	is	going	to	propel	them	to	 be 	 come 	 	heroes	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 neighbor 	 hood 	 s 	 	.
 effective 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 brain 	 wash 	 ing 	 	process	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 beg 	 un 	 	.
step	five	:	i	 believ 	 e 	 	the	taliban	have	one	of	the	most	effective	 mean 	 s 	 	of	 propag 	 and 	 a 	 	.
 the 	 ir 	 	 video 	 s 	 	that	they	use	are	 inter 	 cut 	 	with	 photograph 	 s 	 	of	men	and	women	and	children	 dy 	 ing 	 	in	 ir 	 aq 	 	and	afghanistan	and	in	pakistan	.
and	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	 mess 	 age 	 	is	that	the	western	 power 	 s 	 	do	not	care	about	 civil 	 ian 	 	 death 	 s 	 	,	so	 t 	 hose 	 	people	who	live	in	 area 	 s 	 	and	support	 government 	 s 	 	that	work	with	western	 power 	 s 	 	are	fair	game	.
that	's	why	pakistani	 civil 	 ians 	 	,	over	6,000	of	whom	have	 be 	 en 	 	 kill 	 ed 	 	in	the	last	two	 year 	 s 	 	 al 	 one 	 	,	are	fair	game	.
now	these	children	are	 prim 	 ed 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	 su 	 icide 	 	 bomb 	 ers 	 	.
they	're	ready	to	go	out	and	fight	 be 	 cause 	 	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	told	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	 effective 	 ly 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	way	to	 glor 	 ify 	 	islam	.
i	want	you	to	watch	 an 	 other 	 	excerpt	from	the	film	.
 th 	 is 	 	boy	is	 call 	 ed 	 	zenola	.
he	 ble 	 w 	 	 him 	 self 	 	up	,	 kill 	 ing 	 	six	.
 th 	 is 	 	boy	is	 call 	 ed 	 	sadik	.
he	 kill 	 ed 	 	22	.
 th 	 is 	 	boy	is	 call 	 ed 	 	messoud	.
he	 kill 	 ed 	 	28	.
the	taliban	are	running	 su 	 icide 	 	 school 	 s 	 	,	 pre 	 par 	 ing 	 	a	generation	of	 boy 	 s 	 	for	 atro 	 cities 	 	against	 civil 	 ians 	 	.
do	you	want	to	carry	out	a	 su 	 icide 	 	attack	?
boy	:	i	would	love	to	.
but	 on 	 ly 	 	if	i	get	 per 	 mission 	 	from	my	dad	.
when	i	look	at	 su 	 icide 	 	 bomb 	 ers 	 	 young 	 er 	 	than	me	,	or	my	age	,	i	get	so	inspired	by	 the 	 ir 	 	 terr 	 ific 	 	 attack 	 s 	 	.
soc	:	what	 bless 	 ing 	 	would	you	get	from	 carry 	 ing 	 	out	a	 su 	 icide 	 	attack	?
boy	:	on	the	day	of	judgment	,	god	will	ask	me	,	``	why	did	you	do	that	?	``
i	will	answer	,	``	my	lord	!	 on 	 ly 	 	to	make	you	happy	!
i	have	laid	down	my	life	 fight 	 ing 	 	the	 infidel 	 s 	 	.	``
then	god	will	look	at	my	 intent 	 ion 	 	.
if	my	 intent 	 ion 	 	was	to	 eradic 	 ate 	 	 e 	 vil 	 	for	islam	,	then	i	will	be	 reward 	 ed 	 	with	 para 	 dis 	 e 	 	.
 s 	 ing 	 er 	 	:	♫	on	the	day	of	judgment	♫	♫	my	god	will	call	me	♫	♫	my	body	will	be	put	back	together	♫	♫	and	god	will	ask	me	why	i	did	 th 	 is 	 	♫	soc	:	i	 leav 	 e 	 	you	all	with	 th 	 is 	 	thought	:
if	you	grew	up	in	these	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	,	 face 	 d 	 	with	these	 choice 	 s 	 	,	would	you	 choos 	 e 	 	to	live	in	 th 	 is 	 	world	or	in	the	 glor 	 ious 	 	 after 	 life 	 	?
 a 	 s 	 	one	taliban	 recruit 	 er 	 	told	me	,	``	there	will	 al 	 ways 	 	be	 sacri 	 ficial 	 	 lamb 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	war	.	``
thank	you	.
