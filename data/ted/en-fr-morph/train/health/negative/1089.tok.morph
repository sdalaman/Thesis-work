so	i	was	born	on	the	last	day	of	the	last	year	of	the	'70s	.
i	was	raised	on	``	free	to	be	you	and	me	``	--	hip	-	hop	--	not	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 woohoo 	 s 	 	for	hip	-	hop	in	the	house	.
thank	you	.	thank	you	for	hip	-	hop	--	and	anita	hill	.
my	 parent 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 radical 	 s 	 	--	who	 be 	 came 	 	,	well	,	grown	-	 up 	 s 	 	.
my	dad	 facet 	 iously 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 s 	 ave 	 	the	world	,	and	 in 	 stead 	 	we	just	got	rich	.	``
we	 actual 	 ly 	 	just	got	``	middle	class	``	in	colorado	 spring 	 s 	 	,	colorado	,	but	you	get	the	picture	.
i	was	raised	with	a	 ver 	 y 	 	heavy	sense	of	 un 	 finish 	 ed 	 	 leg 	 acy 	 	.
at	 th 	 is 	 	 rip 	 e 	 	old	age	of	30	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	a	lot	about	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	to	grow	up	in	 th 	 is 	 	 horr 	 ible 	 	,	 beaut 	 iful 	 	time	,
and	i	've	 decide 	 d 	 	,	for	me	,	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	real	journey	and	paradox	.
the	first	paradox	is	that	growing	up	is	about	 reject 	 ing 	 	the	past	and	then	 prompt 	 ly 	 	 re 	 claim 	 ing 	 	it	.
 femin 	 ism 	 	was	the	water	i	grew	up	in	.
when	i	was	just	a	little	girl	,	my	mom	 start 	 ed 	 	what	is	now	the	 long 	 est 	 	-	running	women	's	film	 fest 	 ival 	 	in	the	world	.
so	while	other	 kid 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	 sitcom 	 s 	 	and	 cartoon 	 s 	 	,	i	was	 watch 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	esoteric	 document 	 aries 	 	made	by	and	about	women	.
you	can	see	how	 th 	 is 	 	had	an	influence	.
but	she	was	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	feminist	in	the	house	.
my	dad	 actual 	 ly 	 	 re 	 sign 	 ed 	 	from	the	male	-	 on 	 ly 	 	business	club	in	my	 home 	 town 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 s 	 aid 	 	he	would	never	be	part	of	an	 organ 	 ization 	 	that	would	one	day	welcome	his	son	,	but	not	his	daughter	.
he	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	here	 to 	 day 	 	.
the	trick	here	is	my	brother	would	 be 	 come 	 	an	 experiment 	 al 	 	poet	,	not	a	 business 	 man 	 	,	but	the	 intent 	 ion 	 	was	 re 	 ally 	 	good	.
in	any	case	,	i	did	n't	 read 	 ily 	 	claim	the	feminist	label	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	it	was	all	around	me	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 associate 	 d 	 	it	with	my	mom	's	women	's	 group 	 s 	 	,	her	 s 	 wish 	 y 	 	 skirt 	 s 	 	and	her	shoulder	 pad 	 s 	 	--	 non 	 e 	 	of	which	had	much	 cache 	 t 	 	in	the	 hall 	 ways 	 	of	palmer	high	school	where	i	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	be	cool	at	the	time	.
but	i	 suspect 	 ed 	 	there	was	 some 	 thing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	whole	 femin 	 ism 	 	thing	,	so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 cover 	 t 	 ly 	 	 tiptoe 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	my	mom	's	 book 	 shelv 	 es 	 	and	 pick 	 ing 	 	 book 	 s 	 	off	and	 read 	 ing 	 	them	--	never	,	of	course	,	 admit 	 ting 	 	that	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	so	.
i	did	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	claim	the	feminist	label	 un 	 til 	 	i	went	to	barnard	college	and	i	heard	amy	richards	and	jennifer	baumgardner	speak	for	the	first	time	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	the	co	-	 author 	 s 	 	of	a	book	 call 	 ed 	 	``	manifesta	.	``
so	what	 ver 	 y 	 	 pro 	 found 	 	 epiph 	 any 	 	,	you	might	ask	,	was	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	my	feminist	click	moment	?
 fish 	 net 	 	 stock 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
jennifer	baumgardner	was	 wear 	 ing 	 	them	.
i	thought	they	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	hot	.
i	 decide 	 d 	 	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	i	can	claim	the	feminist	label	.
now	i	tell	you	 th 	 is 	 	--	i	tell	you	 th 	 is 	 	at	the	risk	of	 embarrass 	 ing 	 	 my 	 self 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	part	of	the	work	of	 femin 	 ism 	 	is	to	admit	that	 aesthetic 	 s 	 	,	that	 beaut 	 y 	 	,	that	 f 	 un 	 	do	matter	.
there	are	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 ver 	 y 	 	modern	 politic 	 al 	 	 move 	 ments 	 	that	have	caught	fire	in	no	small	part	 be 	 cause 	 	of	cultural	 hip 	 ness 	 	.
 any 	 one 	 	heard	of	these	two	 guy 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	?
so	my	 femin 	 ism 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	indebted	to	my	mom	's	,
but	it	 look 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	different	.
my	mom	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 patriarch 	 y 	 	.	``
i	say	,	``	 intersect 	 ion 	 ality 	 	.	``
so	race	,	class	,	gender	,	ability	,	all	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	go	 in 	 to 	 	our	 experience 	 s 	 	of	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	to	be	a	woman	.
pay	 equ 	 ity 	 	?	 y 	 es 	 	.	 absolute 	 ly 	 	a	feminist	issue	.
but	for	me	,	so	is	 im 	 migr 	 ation 	 	.
thank	you	.
my	mom	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	protest	march	.	``
i	say	,	``	 on 	 line 	 	 organ 	 izing 	 	.	``
i	co	-	edit	,	 a 	 long 	 	with	a	 collect 	 ive 	 	of	other	super	-	smart	,	 amaz 	 ing 	 	women	,	a	 s 	 ite 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	feministing.com	.
we	are	the	most	 wide 	 ly 	 	read	feminist	 public 	 ation 	 	ever	,
and	i	tell	you	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	see	that	there	's	a	 continu 	 um 	 	.
feminist	 b 	 logging 	 	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	the	21st	century	version	of	 conscious 	 ness 	 	raising	.
but	we	 al 	 so 	 	have	a	 straight 	 forward 	 	 politic 	 al 	 	impact	.
feministing	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	get	 merchan 	 dis 	 e 	 	 pull 	 ed 	 	off	the	 shelv 	 es 	 	of	walmart	.
we	got	a	 mis 	 ogy 	 n 	 ist 	 	 administr 	 ator 	 	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	us	hate	-	mail	 fire 	 d 	 	from	a	big	ten	school	.
and	one	of	our	 big 	 gest 	 	 success 	 es 	 	is	we	get	mail	from	 teen 	 age 	 	 girl 	 s 	 	in	the	middle	of	iowa	who	say	,	``	i	googled	jessica	simpson	and	 s 	 tumble 	 d 	 	on	your	 s 	 ite 	 	.
i	 real 	 ized 	 	 femin 	 ism 	 	was	n't	about	man	-	 hat 	 ing 	 	and	birkenstocks	.	``
so	we	're	able	to	pull	in	the	next	generation	in	a	 total 	 ly 	 	new	way	.
my	mom	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	gloria	steinem	.	``
i	say	,	``	samhita	mukhopadhyay	,	miriam	perez	,	ann	friedman	,	jessica	valenti	,	vanessa	valenti	,	we	do	n't	want	one	hero	.

which	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	me	to	the	second	paradox	:	 sober 	 ing 	 	up	about	our	 small 	 ness 	 	and	 maintain 	 ing 	 	faith	in	our	 great 	 ness 	 	all	at	once	.
 man 	 y 	 	in	my	generation	--	 be 	 cause 	 	of	well	-	intentioned	 parent 	 ing 	 	and	self	-	esteem	education	--	 we 	 re 	 	 social 	 ized 	 	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	special	little	 snow 	 flake 	 s 	 	--	who	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	go	out	and	 s 	 ave 	 	the	world	.
these	are	three	 word 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	of	us	 we 	 re 	 	raised	with	.
we	walk	 a 	 cross 	 	 gradu 	 ation 	 	 stage 	 s 	 	,	high	on	our	 over 	 blown 	 	 expect 	 ations 	 	,	and	when	we	float	back	down	to	earth	,	we	 real 	 ize 	 	we	do	n't	know	what	the	heck	it	 mean 	 s 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 ave 	 	the	world	 any 	 way 	 	.
the	 main 	 stream 	 	media	often	 paint 	 s 	 	my	generation	 a 	 s 	 	 a 	 pathetic 	 	,
and	i	think	it	's	much	more	accurate	to	say	we	are	 deep 	 ly 	 	 overwhelm 	 ed 	 	.	and	there	's	a	lot	to	be	 overwhelm 	 ed 	 	about	,	to	be	fair	--	an	 environment 	 al 	 	crisis	,	wealth	 dis 	 par 	 ity 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	 un 	 like 	 	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	since	1928	,	and	 global 	 ly 	 	,	a	 total 	 ly 	 	immoral	and	 on 	 going 	 	wealth	 dis 	 par 	 ity 	 	.

it	's	 en 	 ough 	 	to	make	you	feel	 ver 	 y 	 	 overwhelm 	 ed 	 	.
i	 experience 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 first 	 hand 	 	 my 	 self 	 	when	i	 graduate 	 d 	 	from	barnard	college	in	2002	.
i	was	 fire 	 d 	 	up	;	i	was	ready	to	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
i	went	out	and	i	 work 	 ed 	 	at	a	non	-	profit	,	i	went	to	grad	school	,	i	phone	-	 bank 	 ed 	 	,	i	 protest 	 ed 	 	,	i	 volunteer 	 ed 	 	,	and	 non 	 e 	 	of	it	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	matter	.
and	on	a	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	dark	night	of	december	of	2004	,	i	 s 	 at 	 	down	with	my	family	,	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	that	i	had	 be 	 come 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 dis 	 illusion 	 ed 	 	.
i	admitted	that	i	'd	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	a	 fanta 	 s 	 y 	 	--	kind	of	a	dark	 fanta 	 s 	 y 	 	--	of	writing	a	letter	about	 every 	 thing 	 	that	was	wrong	with	the	world	and	then	 light 	 ing 	 	 my 	 self 	 	on	fire	on	the	white	house	 step 	 s 	 	.
my	mom	took	a	drink	of	her	signature	sea	breeze	,	her	 eye 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 well 	 ed 	 	with	 tear 	 s 	 	,	and	she	 look 	 ed 	 	right	at	me	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	will	not	stand	for	your	 de 	 s 	 per 	 ation 	 	.	``
she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	are	 smart 	 er 	 	,	more	creative	and	more	 resili 	 ent 	 	than	that	.	``
which	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	me	to	my	third	paradox	.
growing	up	is	about	 aim 	 ing 	 	to	succeed	 wild 	 ly 	 	and	 be 	 ing 	 	 fulfill 	 ed 	 	by	 fail 	 ing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	well	.
there	's	a	writer	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 deep 	 ly 	 	 influence 	 d 	 	by	,	parker	palmer	,	and	he	 write 	 s 	 	that	 man 	 y 	 	of	us	are	often	 whip 	 lash 	 ed 	 	``	between	 arrog 	 ant 	 	 over 	 estimation 	 	of	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	a	 serv 	 ile 	 	 under 	 estimation 	 	of	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.	``
you	may	have	 guess 	 ed 	 	by	now	,	i	did	not	light	 my 	 self 	 	on	fire	.
i	did	what	i	know	to	do	in	 de 	 s 	 per 	 ation 	 	,	which	is	write	.
i	wrote	the	book	i	 need 	 ed 	 	to	read	.
i	wrote	a	book	about	eight	 in 	 credible 	 	people	all	over	 th 	 is 	 	country	 do 	 ing 	 	social	justice	work	.
i	wrote	about	nia	martin	-	robinson	,	the	daughter	of	detroit	and	two	civil	 right 	 s 	 	 activist 	 s 	 	,	who	's	 d 	 ed 	 ic 	 ating 	 	her	life	to	 environment 	 al 	 	justice	.
i	wrote	about	emily	apt	who	 initi 	 ally 	 	 be 	 came 	 	a	 case 	 work 	 er 	 	in	the	 wel 	 fare 	 	system	 be 	 cause 	 	she	 decide 	 d 	 	that	was	the	most	noble	thing	she	could	do	,	but	 quick 	 ly 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	did	she	not	like	it	,	but	she	was	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	good	at	it	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	what	she	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	was	make	 film 	 s 	 	.
so	she	made	a	film	about	the	 wel 	 fare 	 	system	and	had	a	huge	impact	.
i	wrote	about	maricela	guzman	,	the	daughter	of	mexican	 im 	 migrant 	 s 	 	,	who	 join 	 ed 	 	the	 militar 	 y 	 	so	she	could	afford	college	.
she	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 sexual 	 ly 	 	 assault 	 ed 	 	in	boot	camp	and	went	on	to	co	-	organize	a	group	 call 	 ed 	 	the	service	women	's	action	network	.
what	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	these	people	and	 other 	 s 	 	was	that	i	could	n't	 judg 	 e 	 	them	based	on	 the 	 ir 	 	failure	to	meet	 the 	 ir 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	lofty	 goal 	 s 	 	.
 man 	 y 	 	of	them	are	 work 	 ing 	 	in	 deep 	 ly 	 	intractable	 system 	 s 	 	--	the	 militar 	 y 	 	,	congress	,	the	education	system	,	etc	.
but	what	they	 manage 	 d 	 	to	do	 with 	 in 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 system 	 s 	 	was	be	a	 human 	 izing 	 	force	.
and	at	the	end	of	the	day	,	what	could	possibly	be	more	 import 	 ant 	 	than	that	?
cornel	west	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	of	course	it	's	a	failure	.
but	how	good	a	failure	is	it	?	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	to	say	we	give	up	our	 wild 	 est 	 	,	 big 	 gest 	 	 dream 	 s 	 	.
it	's	to	say	we	 oper 	 ate 	 	on	two	 level 	 s 	 	.
on	one	,	we	 re 	 ally 	 	go	after	changing	these	broken	 system 	 s 	 	of	which	we	find	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	a	part	.
but	on	the	other	,	we	root	our	self	-	esteem	in	the	 dai 	 ly 	 	 act 	 s 	 	of	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	one	person	's	day	more	kind	,	more	just	,	etc	.
so	when	i	was	a	little	girl	,	i	had	a	couple	of	 ver 	 y 	 	strange	 habit 	 s 	 	.
one	of	them	was	i	used	to	lie	on	the	kitchen	floor	of	my	 child 	 hood 	 	home	,	and	i	would	suck	the	thumb	of	my	left	hand	and	hold	my	mom	's	cold	 to 	 es 	 	with	my	right	hand	.
i	was	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	her	talk	on	the	phone	,	which	she	did	a	lot	.
she	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	board	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	she	was	 found 	 ing 	 	peace	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	,	she	was	 coordi 	 nating 	 	 car 	 pool 	 s 	 	,	she	was	 consol 	 ing 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	--	all	these	 dai 	 ly 	 	 act 	 s 	 	of	care	and	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	.
and	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	,	at	three	and	four	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	i	was	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	the	 so 	 oth 	 ing 	 	sound	of	her	voice	,
but	i	think	i	was	 al 	 so 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	my	first	 less 	 on 	 	in	activist	work	.
the	 activist 	 s 	 	i	 interview 	 ed 	 	had	 noth 	 ing 	 	in	common	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	one	thing	,	which	was	that	they	all	 cit 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 mother 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	most	 loom 	 ing 	 	and	 import 	 ant 	 	activist	 influence 	 s 	 	.
so	often	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	at	a	young	age	,	we	look	far	 a 	 field 	 	for	our	 model 	 s 	 	of	the	 meaning 	 ful 	 	life	,	and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	they	're	in	our	own	 kitchen 	 s 	 	,	 talk 	 ing 	 	on	the	phone	,	making	us	 d 	 inner 	 	,	 do 	 ing 	 	all	that	 keep 	 s 	 	the	world	going	around	and	around	.
my	mom	and	so	 man 	 y 	 	women	like	her	have	taught	me	that	life	is	not	about	 glor 	 y 	 	,	or	 certain 	 ty 	 	,	or	security	even	.
it	's	about	 em 	 bracing 	 	the	paradox	.
it	's	about	 act 	 ing 	 	in	the	face	of	overwhelm	.
and	it	's	about	loving	people	 re 	 ally 	 	well	.
and	at	the	end	of	the	day	,	these	 thing 	 s 	 	make	for	a	 life 	 time 	 	of	 challeng 	 e 	 	and	reward	.
thank	you	.
