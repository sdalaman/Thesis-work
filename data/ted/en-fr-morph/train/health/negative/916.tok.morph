i	'm	an	american	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	,	 general 	 ly 	 	,	i	 ignor 	 e 	 	 foot 	 ball 	 	 un 	 less 	 	it	 involve 	 s 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	my	 s 	 ize 	 	or	bruno	's	 s 	 ize 	 	running	 in 	 to 	 	each	other	at	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	high	 speed 	 s 	 	.
that	 s 	 aid 	 	,	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	to	 ignor 	 e 	 	 foot 	 ball 	 	for	the	last	couple	of	 week 	 s 	 	.
i	go	onto	twitter	,	there	are	all	these	strange	 word 	 s 	 	that	i	've	never	heard	before	:	fifa	,	vuvuzela	,	weird	 joke 	 s 	 	about	 oct 	 opi 	 	.
but	the	one	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 be 	 en 	 	sort	of	 stress 	 ing 	 	me	out	,	that	i	have	n't	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	figure	out	,	is	 th 	 is 	 	phrase	``	cala	a	 bo 	 ca 	 	,	galvao	.	``
if	you	've	gone	onto	twitter	in	the	last	couple	of	 week 	 s 	 	,	you	've	 prob 	 ably 	 	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	major	 trend 	 ing 	 	 top 	 ic 	 	.
 be 	 ing 	 	a	 mono 	 lingual 	 	american	,	i	 obvious 	 ly 	 	do	n't	know	what	the	phrase	 mean 	 s 	 	.
so	i	went	onto	twitter	,	and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	some	people	if	they	could	explain	to	me	``	cala	a	 bo 	 ca 	 	,	galvao	.	``
and	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	my	brazilian	 friend 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	more	than	ready	to	help	.
they	 explain 	 ed 	 	that	the	galvao	bird	is	a	rare	and	 en 	 danger 	 ed 	 	 par 	 rot 	 	that	's	in	 terr 	 ible 	 	,	 terr 	 ible 	 	danger	.
in	fact	,	i	'll	let	them	tell	you	a	bit	more	about	it	.
 nar 	 rator 	 	:	a	word	about	galvao	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	rare	kind	of	bird	native	to	brazil	.
every	year	,	more	than	300,000	galvao	 bird 	 s 	 	are	 kill 	 ed 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	carnival	 para 	 de 	 s 	 	.
ethan	zuckerman	:	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	tragic	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	and	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 get 	 s 	 	 wo 	 rse 	 	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	is	the	galvao	 par 	 rot 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 attract 	 ive 	 	,	 use 	 ful 	 	for	 head 	 dress 	 es 	 	,	it	 evident 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	certain	 hallucin 	 o 	 genic 	 	 proper 	 ties 	 	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	that	there	's	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	problem	with	galvao	abuse	.
some	sick	and	 twist 	 ed 	 	people	have	found	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 s 	 nor 	 ting 	 	galvao	.
and	it	's	 terr 	 ibly 	 	 en 	 danger 	 ed 	 	.
the	good	news	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	the	global	community	--	 aga 	 in 	 	,	my	brazilian	 friend 	 s 	 	tell	me	--	is	 pitch 	 ing 	 	in	to	help	out	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	 lad 	 y 	 	gaga	 ha 	 s 	 	released	a	new	single	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	five	or	six	new	 single 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	near	 a 	 s 	 	i	can	tell	--	titled	``	cala	a	 bo 	 ca 	 	,	galvao	.	``
and	my	brazilian	 friend 	 s 	 	tell	me	that	if	i	just	tweet	the	phrase	``	cala	a	 bo 	 ca 	 	,	galvao	,	``	10	 cent 	 s 	 	will	be	 give 	 n 	 	to	a	global	campaign	to	 s 	 ave 	 	 th 	 is 	 	rare	and	 beaut 	 iful 	 	bird	.
now	,	most	of	you	have	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	 p 	 rank 	 	,	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	good	one	.
``	cala	a	 bo 	 ca 	 	,	galvao	``	 actual 	 ly 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	different	.	in	portugese	,	it	 mean 	 s 	 	``	shut	your	mouth	,	galvao	.	``
and	it	 specific 	 ally 	 	 refer 	 s 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	guy	,	galvao	bueno	,	who	's	the	lead	soccer	 comment 	 ator 	 	for	rede	globo	.
and	what	i	understand	from	my	brazilian	 friend 	 s 	 	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	guy	is	just	a	cliche	machine	.
he	can	ruin	the	most	 interest 	 ing 	 	match	by	just	 sp 	 out 	 ing 	 	cliche	 aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	.
so	brazilians	went	to	that	first	match	against	north	korea	,	put	up	 th 	 is 	 	 bann 	 er 	 	,	 start 	 ed 	 	a	twitter	campaign	and	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	 con 	 vince 	 	the	rest	of	us	to	tweet	the	phrase	:	``	cala	a	 bo 	 ca 	 	,	galvao	.	``
and	in	fact	,	 we 	 re 	 	so	 success 	 ful 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	that	it	 top 	 ped 	 	twitter	for	two	 week 	 s 	 	.
now	there	's	a	couple	--	there	's	a	couple	of	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	that	you	can	take	from	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	the	first	 less 	 on 	 	,	which	i	think	is	a	 worth 	 while 	 	one	,	is	that	you	can	not	go	wrong	 ask 	 ing 	 	people	to	be	active	 on 	 line 	 	,	so	long	 a 	 s 	 	 activ 	 ism 	 	just	 mean 	 s 	 	 re 	 tweet 	 ing 	 	a	phrase	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	 activ 	 ism 	 	is	that	simple	,	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	easy	to	get	away	with	.
the	other	thing	you	can	take	from	 th 	 is 	 	,	by	the	way	,	is	that	there	are	a	lot	of	brazilians	on	twitter	.
there	's	more	than	five	million	of	them	.
 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	national	 represent 	 ation 	 	,	11	percent	of	brazilian	 inter 	 net 	 	 user 	 s 	 	are	on	twitter	.
that	's	a	much	 high 	 er 	 	number	than	in	the	u.s.	or	u.k	.
next	to	japan	,	it	's	the	second	most	 represent 	 ed 	 	by	population	.
now	if	you	're	using	twitter	or	other	social	 network 	 s 	 	,	and	you	did	n't	 real 	 ize 	 	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	space	with	a	lot	of	brazilians	in	it	,	you	're	like	most	of	us	.
 be 	 cause 	 	what	 happen 	 s 	 	on	a	social	network	is	you	interact	with	the	people	that	you	have	 chose 	 n 	 	to	interact	with	.
and	if	you	are	like	me	,	a	big	,	 geek 	 y 	 	,	white	,	american	guy	,	you	tend	to	interact	with	a	lot	of	other	 geek 	 y 	 	,	white	,	american	 guy 	 s 	 	.
and	you	do	n't	 necess 	 arily 	 	have	the	sense	that	twitter	is	in	fact	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 heav 	 ily 	 	brazilian	space	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	surprising	to	 man 	 y 	 	americans	,	a	 heav 	 ily 	 	african	-	american	space	.
twitter	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	did	some	research	.
they	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 the 	 ir 	 	local	population	.
they	 believ 	 e 	 	that	24	percent	of	american	twitter	 user 	 s 	 	are	african	-	american	.
that	's	about	twice	 a 	 s 	 	high	 a 	 s 	 	african	-	americans	are	 represent 	 ed 	 	in	the	population	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	that	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 shock 	 ing 	 	to	 man 	 y 	 	twitter	 user 	 s 	 	,	but	it	should	n't	be	.
and	the	reason	it	should	n't	be	is	that	on	any	day	you	can	go	 in 	 to 	 	 trend 	 ing 	 	 top 	 ic 	 s 	 	.	and	you	tend	to	find	 top 	 ic 	 s 	 	that	are	 al 	 most 	 	 entire 	 ly 	 	african	-	american	 conversation 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	 visual 	 ization 	 	 d 	 one 	 	by	fernando	viegas	and	martin	wattenberg	,	two	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 visual 	 ization 	 	 design 	 ers 	 	,	who	 look 	 ed 	 	at	a	 week 	 end 	 	's	worth	of	twitter	traffic	and	 essential 	 ly 	 	found	that	a	lot	of	these	 trend 	 ing 	 	 top 	 ic 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	 s 	 egreg 	 ated 	 	 conversation 	 s 	 	--	and	in	ways	that	you	would	n't	expect	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	oil	 s 	 pill 	 	is	a	 most 	 ly 	 	white	conversation	,	that	 cook 	 out 	 	is	a	 most 	 ly 	 	black	conversation	.
and	what	's	crazy	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	if	you	 want 	 ed 	 	to	mix	up	who	you	 we 	 re 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	on	twitter	,	it	's	 liter 	 ally 	 	a	quick	click	away	.
you	click	on	that	 cook 	 out 	 	tag	,	there	an	 entire 	 ly 	 	different	conversation	with	different	people	 particip 	 ating 	 	in	it	.
but	 general 	 ly 	 	 s 	 peaking 	 	,	most	of	us	do	n't	.
we	end	up	 with 	 in 	 	these	filter	 bubble 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	my	friend	eli	pariser	 call 	 s 	 	them	,	where	we	see	the	people	we	 al 	 ready 	 	know	and	the	people	who	are	similar	to	the	people	we	 al 	 ready 	 	know	.
and	we	tend	not	to	see	that	 wide 	 r 	 	picture	.
now	for	me	,	i	'm	 surprise 	 d 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	was	n't	how	the	 inter 	 net 	 	was	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	.
if	you	go	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	early	 day 	 s 	 	of	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	when	cyber	-	utopians	like	nick	negroponte	 we 	 re 	 	writing	big	 book 	 s 	 	like	``	 be 	 ing 	 	digital	,	``	the	 predict 	 ion 	 	was	that	the	 inter 	 net 	 	was	going	to	be	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	force	to	smooth	out	cultural	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	,	to	put	us	all	on	a	common	field	of	one	fashion	or	 an 	 other 	 	.
negroponte	 start 	 ed 	 	his	book	with	a	story	about	how	hard	it	is	to	build	 connect 	 ions 	 	in	the	world	of	 atom 	 s 	 	.
he	's	at	a	technology	 con 	 ference 	 	in	florida	.
and	he	's	looking	at	 some 	 thing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 tru 	 ly 	 	absurd	,	which	is	 bottle 	 s 	 	of	evian	water	on	the	table	.
and	negroponte	 say 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	crazy	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	old	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.	it	's	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	of	moving	these	heavy	,	 s 	 low 	 	 atom 	 s 	 	over	long	 distance 	 s 	 	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	to	do	.
we	're	 head 	 ing 	 	to	the	future	of	bits	,	where	 every 	 thing 	 	is	 speed 	 y 	 	,	it	's	 weight 	 less 	 	.	it	can	be	 any 	 where 	 	in	the	world	at	any	time	.
and	it	's	going	to	change	the	world	 a 	 s 	 	we	know	it	.
now	,	negroponte	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	right	about	a	lot	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.	he	's	 total 	 ly 	 	wrong	about	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	in	 man 	 y 	 	 case 	 s 	 	 atom 	 s 	 	are	much	more	mobile	than	bits	.
if	i	walk	 in 	 to 	 	a	store	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	for	me	to	buy	water	that	's	 bottle 	 d 	 	in	fiji	,	 ship 	 ped 	 	at	great	expense	to	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 surprising 	 ly 	 	hard	for	me	to	see	a	fijian	feature	film	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	difficult	for	me	to	listen	to	fijian	music	.	it	's	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	difficult	for	me	to	get	fijian	news	,	which	is	strange	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	there	's	an	enormous	amount	going	on	in	fiji	.
there	's	a	coup	government	.	there	's	a	 militar 	 y 	 	government	.
there	's	 crack 	 down 	 s 	 	on	the	press	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	place	that	we	 prob 	 ably 	 	should	be	 pay 	 ing 	 	attention	to	at	the	moment	.
here	's	what	i	think	is	going	on	.	i	think	that	we	tend	to	look	a	lot	at	the	 infra 	 structure 	 	of	 global 	 ization 	 	.	we	look	at	the	 frame 	 work 	 	that	 make 	 s 	 	it	possible	to	live	in	 th 	 is 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	world	.
and	that	's	a	 frame 	 work 	 	that	 include 	 s 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 air 	 line 	 	 route 	 s 	 	.	it	 include 	 s 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 cable 	 s 	 	.
we	look	at	a	map	like	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	and	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	the	entire	world	is	flat	 be 	 cause 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	is	a	hop	or	two	away	.
you	can	get	on	a	flight	in	london	,	you	can	end	up	in	bangalore	 lat 	 er 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
two	 hop 	 s 	 	,	you	're	in	suva	,	the	 cap 	 itol 	 	of	fiji	.
it	's	all	right	there	.
when	you	start	looking	at	what	 actual 	 ly 	 	 flow 	 s 	 	on	top	of	these	 network 	 s 	 	,	you	get	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	picture	.
you	start	looking	at	how	the	global	plane	 flight 	 s 	 	move	,	and	you	 sudden 	 ly 	 	discover	that	the	world	is	n't	even	close	to	flat	.
it	's	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 lump 	 y 	 	.
there	are	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	world	that	are	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	well	 connect 	 ed 	 	.
there	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	a	giant	 path 	 way 	 	in	the	sky	between	london	and	new	york	.
but	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	map	,	and	you	can	watch	 th 	 is 	 	for	,	you	know	,	two	or	three	 minute 	 s 	 	.
you	wo	n't	see	 ver 	 y 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 plane 	 s 	 	go	from	south	america	to	africa	.
and	you	'll	discover	that	there	are	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	 glob 	 e 	 	that	are	 system 	 at 	 ically 	 	cut	off	.
when	we	stop	looking	at	the	 infra 	 structure 	 	that	 make 	 s 	 	 connect 	 ion 	 	possible	,	and	we	look	at	what	 actual 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	,	we	start	 real 	 izing 	 	that	the	world	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	 quit 	 e 	 	the	same	way	that	we	think	it	 do 	 es 	 	.
so	here	's	the	problem	that	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	in	the	last	decade	or	so	.
the	world	is	,	in	fact	,	 get 	 ting 	 	more	global	.
it	's	 get 	 ting 	 	more	 connect 	 ed 	 	.
more	of	 problem 	 s 	 	are	global	in	scale	.
more	of	our	 economic 	 s 	 	is	global	in	scale	.
and	our	media	is	less	global	by	the	day	.
if	you	 watch 	 ed 	 	a	 tele 	 vision 	 	 broad 	 cast 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	in	the	1970s	,	35	to	40	percent	of	it	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	 inter 	 national 	 	news	on	a	 night 	 ly 	 	new	 broad 	 cast 	 	.
that	's	down	to	about	12	to	15	percent	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	 tend 	 s 	 	to	give	us	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 distort 	 ed 	 	view	of	the	world	.
here	's	a	slide	that	alisa	miller	 show 	 ed 	 	at	a	previous	ted	talk	.
alisa	's	the	 p 	 resident 	 	of	public	radio	 inter 	 national 	 	.
and	she	made	a	 cart 	 ogram 	 	,	which	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	a	 distort 	 ed 	 	map	based	on	what	american	 tele 	 vision 	 	news	 cast 	 s 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	at	for	a	month	.
and	you	see	that	when	you	distort	a	map	based	on	attention	,	the	world	 with 	 in 	 	american	 tele 	 vision 	 	news	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	 reduc 	 ed 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	giant	 bloat 	 ed 	 	u.s.	and	a	couple	of	other	 count 	 ries 	 	which	we	've	 invad 	 ed 	 	.
and	that	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	what	our	media	is	about	.
and	before	you	conclude	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	a	function	of	american	tv	news	--	which	is	 dread 	 ful 	 	,	and	i	agree	that	it	's	 dread 	 ful 	 	--	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	mapping	elite	media	like	the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	,	and	i	get	the	same	thing	.
when	you	look	at	the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	,	you	look	at	other	elite	media	,	what	you	 large 	 ly 	 	get	are	 picture 	 s 	 	of	 ver 	 y 	 	 wealth 	 y 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	and	the	 nation 	 s 	 	we	've	 invad 	 ed 	 	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	new	media	is	n't	 necess 	 arily 	 	 help 	 ing 	 	us	all	that	much	.
here	's	a	map	made	by	mark	graham	who	's	down	the	street	at	the	oxford	 inter 	 net 	 	institute	.
a	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	map	of	 article 	 s 	 	in	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	geo	-	 cod 	 ed 	 	.
and	you	'll	notice	that	there	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	heavy	bias	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	north	america	and	western	europe	.
even	 with 	 in 	 	wikipedias	,	where	we	're	creating	 the 	 ir 	 	own	content	 on 	 line 	 	,	there	's	a	heavy	bias	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	place	where	a	lot	of	the	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	 author 	 s 	 	are	based	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	to	the	rest	of	the	world	.
in	the	u.k.	,	you	can	get	up	,	you	can	pick	up	your	computer	when	you	get	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	session	,	you	could	read	a	 news 	 paper 	 	from	india	or	from	australia	,	from	canada	,	god	forbid	from	the	u.s	.
you	 prob 	 ably 	 	wo	n't	.
if	you	look	at	 on 	 line 	 	media	consumption	--	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	in	the	top	10	 user 	 s 	 	of	the	 inter 	 net 	 	--	more	than	95	percent	of	the	news	 read 	 er 	 ship 	 	is	on	domestic	news	 s 	 ites 	 	.
it	's	one	of	these	rare	 case 	 s 	 	where	the	u.s.	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	better	than	[	the	u.k.	]	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	like	 read 	 ing 	 	your	media	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	vice	versa	.
so	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	 start 	 s 	 	 lead 	 ing 	 	me	to	think	that	we	're	in	a	state	that	i	refer	to	 a 	 s 	 	 imagin 	 ary 	 	 cosmo 	 politan 	 ism 	 	.
we	look	at	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
we	think	we	're	 get 	 ting 	 	 th 	 is 	 	wide	view	of	the	 glob 	 e 	 	.
we	 occasion 	 ally 	 	 s 	 tumble 	 	onto	a	page	in	chinese	,	and	we	decide	that	we	do	in	fact	have	the	 great 	 est 	 	technology	ever	built	to	connect	us	to	the	rest	of	the	world	.
and	we	forget	that	most	of	the	time	we	're	 check 	 ing 	 	boston	red	sox	 score 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	real	problem	--	not	just	 be 	 cause 	 	the	red	sox	are	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	bad	year	--
but	it	's	a	real	problem	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	're	 discuss 	 ing 	 	here	at	ted	,	the	real	 problem 	 s 	 	in	the	world	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	to	solve	are	global	in	scale	and	scope	,
they	 requir 	 e 	 	global	 conversation 	 s 	 	to	get	to	global	 solution 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	problem	we	have	to	solve	.
so	here	's	the	good	news	.
for	six	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 hang 	 ing 	 	out	with	these	 guy 	 s 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	group	 call 	 ed 	 	global	 voice 	 s 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	team	of	 blogger 	 s 	 	from	around	the	world	.
our	mission	was	to	fix	the	world	's	media	.
we	 start 	 ed 	 	in	2004	.
you	might	have	 notice 	 d 	 	,	we	have	n't	 d 	 one 	 	all	that	well	so	far	.
nor	do	i	think	we	are	by	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	to	solve	the	problem	.
but	the	more	that	i	think	about	it	,	the	more	that	i	think	that	a	few	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	 a 	 long 	 	the	way	are	 interest 	 ing 	 	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	for	how	we	would	 re 	 wire 	 	if	we	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	use	the	web	to	have	a	 wide 	 r 	 	world	.
the	first	thing	you	have	to	consider	is	that	there	are	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	world	that	are	dark	 spot 	 s 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	attention	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	--	the	map	of	the	world	at	night	by	nasa	--	they	're	dark	 liter 	 ally 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	lack	of	 electric 	 ity 	 	.
and	i	used	to	think	that	a	dark	spot	on	 th 	 is 	 	map	 bas 	 ically 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	you	're	not	going	to	get	media	from	there	 be 	 cause 	 	there	are	more	 bas 	 ic 	 	 need 	 s 	 	.
what	i	'm	 start 	 ing 	 	to	 real 	 ize 	 	is	that	you	can	get	media	,	it	's	just	an	enormous	amount	of	work	,	and	you	need	an	enormous	amount	of	 encourag 	 ement 	 	.
one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	dark	 spot 	 s 	 	is	madagascar	,	a	country	which	is	 general 	 ly 	 	better	known	for	the	dreamworks	film	than	it	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	known	for	the	 love 	 ly 	 	people	who	live	there	.
and	so	the	people	who	 found 	 ed 	 	foko	club	in	madagascar	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	 concern 	 ed 	 	with	 try 	 ing 	 	to	change	the	image	of	 the 	 ir 	 	country	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	much	 simpl 	 er 	 	.
it	was	a	club	to	learn	english	and	to	learn	 computer 	 s 	 	and	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
but	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	was	that	madagascar	went	through	a	violent	coup	.
most	 in 	 dependent 	 	media	was	shut	down	.
and	the	high	school	 student 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	to	blog	through	foko	club	 sudden 	 ly 	 	found	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	an	 inter 	 national 	 	audience	about	the	 demonst 	 ration 	 s 	 	,	the	violence	,	 every 	 thing 	 	that	was	going	on	 with 	 in 	 	 th 	 is 	 	country	.
so	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	small	program	designed	to	get	people	in	front	of	 computer 	 s 	 	,	 publish 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 thought 	 s 	 	,	 publish 	 ing 	 	 in 	 dependent 	 	media	,	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	huge	impact	on	what	we	know	about	 th 	 is 	 	country	.
most	people	here	do	n't	speak	malagasy	.
i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	 guess 	 ing 	 	that	most	of	you	do	n't	even	speak	chinese	--	which	is	sort	of	 s 	 ad 	 	if	you	think	about	it	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	's	now	the	most	 represent 	 ed 	 	language	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
 fortunate 	 ly 	 	people	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	how	to	fix	 th 	 is 	 	.
if	you	're	using	google	chrome	and	you	go	to	a	chinese	language	 s 	 ite 	 	,	you	notice	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	cute	box	at	the	top	,	which	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	 detect 	 s 	 	that	the	page	is	in	chinese	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	at	a	mouse	click	will	give	you	a	 transl 	 ation 	 	of	the	page	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	a	machine	 transl 	 ation 	 	of	the	page	.
and	while	google	is	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	good	with	some	 language 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	 dread 	 ful 	 	with	chinese	.
and	the	 result 	 s 	 	can	be	 pre 	 tty 	 	funny	.
what	you	 re 	 ally 	 	want	--	what	i	 re 	 ally 	 	want	,	is	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	the	ability	to	push	a	button	and	have	 th 	 is 	 	 queue 	 d 	 	so	a	human	 be 	 ing 	 	can	 transl 	 ate 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	if	you	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	absurd	,	it	's	not	.
there	's	a	group	right	now	in	 chin 	 a 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	yeeyan	.	and	yeeyan	is	a	group	of	150,000	 volunteer 	 s 	 	who	get	 on 	 line 	 	every	day	.
they	look	for	the	most	 interest 	 ing 	 	content	in	the	english	language	.
they	 transl 	 ate 	 	 rough 	 ly 	 	100	 article 	 s 	 	a	day	from	major	 news 	 paper 	 s 	 	,	major	 web 	 s 	 ites 	 	.
they	put	it	 on 	 line 	 	for	free	.
it	's	the	project	of	a	guy	named	zhang	lei	,	who	was	living	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	lhasa	 riot 	 s 	 	and	who	could	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	how	 bias 	 ed 	 	american	media	 cover 	 age 	 	was	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	if	there	's	one	thing	i	can	do	,	i	can	start	 transl 	 ating 	 	,	so	that	people	between	these	 count 	 ries 	 	start	 understand 	 ing 	 	each	other	a	little	bit	better	.	``	and	my	question	to	you	is	:	if	yeeyan	can	line	up	150,000	people	to	 transl 	 ate 	 	the	english	 inter 	 net 	 	 in 	 to 	 	chinese	,	where	's	the	english	language	yeeyan	?
who	's	going	after	chinese	,	which	now	 ha 	 s 	 	400	million	 inter 	 net 	 	 user 	 s 	 	out	there	?
my	guess	is	at	 l 	 east 	 	one	of	them	 ha 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	say	.
so	even	if	we	can	find	a	way	to	 transl 	 ate 	 	from	chinese	,	there	's	no	guarantee	that	we	're	going	to	find	it	.
when	we	look	for	information	 on 	 line 	 	,	we	 bas 	 ically 	 	have	two	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	.
we	use	a	lot	of	search	.	and	search	is	 terr 	 ific 	 	if	you	know	what	you	're	looking	for	.
but	if	what	you	're	looking	for	is	 s 	 er 	 en 	 dip 	 ity 	 	,	if	you	want	to	 s 	 tumble 	 	onto	 some 	 thing 	 	that	you	did	n't	know	you	 need 	 ed 	 	,	our	main	 philosoph 	 y 	 	is	to	look	to	our	social	 network 	 s 	 	,	to	look	for	our	 friend 	 s 	 	.
what	are	they	looking	at	?	 may 	 be 	 	we	should	be	looking	at	it	.
the	problem	with	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	 essential 	 ly 	 	what	you	end	up	 get 	 ting 	 	after	a	while	is	the	 wis 	 dom 	 	of	the	flock	.
you	end	up	 flock 	 ing 	 	with	a	lot	of	people	who	are	 prob 	 ably 	 	similar	to	you	,	who	have	similar	 interest 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	get	information	from	the	other	 flock 	 s 	 	,	from	the	other	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	world	where	people	 get 	 ting 	 	together	and	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 interest 	 s 	 	.
to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	at	a	certain	point	,	you	need	 some 	 one 	 	to	bump	you	out	of	your	flock	and	 in 	 to 	 	 an 	 other 	 	flock	.
you	need	a	guide	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	amira	al	hussaini	.	she	is	the	middle	east	editor	for	global	 voice 	 s 	 	.	she	 ha 	 s 	 	one	of	the	 hard 	 est 	 	 job 	 s 	 	in	the	world	.
from	 kill 	 ing 	 	each	other	,	she	 ha 	 s 	 	to	figure	out	what	is	going	to	interest	you	about	the	middle	east	.
and	in	that	sense	of	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	you	out	of	your	normal	orbit	,	and	to	try	to	get	you	to	pay	attention	to	a	story	about	 some 	 one 	 	who	's	 give 	 n 	 	up	 smok 	 ing 	 	for	the	month	of	ramadan	,	she	 ha 	 s 	 	to	know	 some 	 thing 	 	about	a	global	audience	.
she	 ha 	 s 	 	to	know	 some 	 thing 	 	about	what	 st 	 ories 	 	are	 avail 	 able 	 	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	,	she	's	a	deejay	.
she	's	a	 skill 	 ed 	 	human	 cur 	 ator 	 	who	 know 	 s 	 	what	material	is	 avail 	 able 	 	to	her	,	who	's	able	to	listen	to	the	audience	,	and	who	's	able	to	make	a	 s 	 election 	 	and	push	people	forward	in	one	fashion	or	 an 	 other 	 	.
i	do	n't	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	 necess 	 arily 	 	an	 algorithm 	 ic 	 	process	.
i	think	what	's	great	about	the	 inter 	 net 	 	is	that	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 make 	 s 	 	it	much	 eas 	 ier 	 	for	 deejay 	 s 	 	to	reach	a	 wide 	 r 	 	audience	.
i	know	amira	.
i	can	ask	her	what	to	read	.
but	with	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	she	's	in	a	position	where	she	can	tell	a	lot	of	people	what	to	read	.
and	you	can	listen	to	her	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	if	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	way	that	you	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 hav 	 ing 	 	your	web	 widen 	 ed 	 	.
so	once	you	start	 widen 	 ing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	once	you	start	 light 	 ing 	 	up	 voice 	 s 	 	in	the	dark	 spot 	 s 	 	,	once	you	start	 transl 	 ating 	 	,	once	you	start	 cur 	 ating 	 	,	you	end	up	in	some	 re 	 ally 	 	weird	 place 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	image	from	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	blog	,	which	is	afrigadget	.
and	afrigadget	is	a	blog	that	 look 	 s 	 	at	technology	in	an	africa	 con 	 text 	 	.
and	 specific 	 ally 	 	,	it	's	looking	at	a	 black 	 smith 	 	in	kibera	in	nairobi	,	who	is	 turn 	 ing 	 	the	shaft	of	a	landrover	 in 	 to 	 	a	cold	chisel	.
and	when	you	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	image	,	you	might	find	 your 	 self 	 	going	,	``	why	would	i	 conceiv 	 ably 	 	care	about	 th 	 is 	 	?	``
and	the	truth	is	,	 th 	 is 	 	guy	can	 prob 	 ably 	 	explain	 th 	 is 	 	to	you	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	erik	hersman	.	you	 guy 	 s 	 	may	have	 s 	 een 	 	him	around	the	 con 	 ference 	 	.
he	 go 	 es 	 	by	the	 mon 	 ik 	 er 	 	white	african	.
he	's	both	a	 ver 	 y 	 	well	known	american	geek	,	but	he	's	 al 	 so 	 	kenyan	;	he	was	born	in	sudan	,	grew	up	in	kenya	.
he	is	a	bridge	figure	.
he	is	 some 	 one 	 	who	 liter 	 ally 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	feet	in	both	 world 	 s 	 	--	one	in	the	world	of	the	african	technology	community	,	one	in	the	world	of	the	american	technology	community	.
and	so	he	's	able	to	tell	a	story	about	 th 	 is 	 	 black 	 smith 	 	in	kibera	and	turn	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	story	about	 re 	 purpos 	 ing 	 	technology	,	about	 innov 	 ating 	 	from	constraint	,	about	looking	for	inspiration	based	on	 re 	 using 	 	 material 	 s 	 	.
he	 know 	 s 	 	one	world	,	and	he	's	 find 	 ing 	 	a	way	to	communicate	it	to	 an 	 other 	 	world	,	both	of	which	he	 ha 	 s 	 	deep	 connect 	 ions 	 	to	.
these	bridge	 figure 	 s 	 	,	i	'm	 pre 	 tty 	 	well	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	,	are	the	future	of	how	we	try	to	make	the	world	 wide 	 r 	 	through	using	the	web	.
but	the	trick	with	 bridge 	 s 	 	is	,	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	you	need	 some 	 one 	 	to	cross	them	.
and	that	's	where	we	start	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 xeno 	 phil 	 es 	 	.
so	if	i	found	 my 	 self 	 	in	the	nfl	,	i	suspect	i	would	 s 	 pend 	 	my	off	-	season	 nurs 	 ing 	 	my	 wound 	 s 	 	,	 enjoy 	 ing 	 	my	house	,	so	on	and	so	forth	--	possibly	 record 	 ing 	 	a	hip	-	hop	 al 	 bum 	 	.
dhani	jones	,	who	is	the	middle	 line 	 back 	 er 	 	for	the	cincinnati	bengals	,	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	different	approach	to	the	off	-	season	.
dhani	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 tele 	 vision 	 	show	.	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	dhani	 tackle 	 s 	 	the	 glob 	 e 	 	.	``
and	every	week	on	 th 	 is 	 	 tele 	 vision 	 	show	,	dhani	 travel 	 s 	 	to	a	different	nation	of	the	world	.
he	 find 	 s 	 	a	local	 s 	 port 	 ing 	 	team	.
he	 train 	 s 	 	with	them	for	a	week	,	and	he	 play 	 s 	 	a	match	with	them	.
and	his	reason	for	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	just	that	he	 want 	 s 	 	to	master	muay	thai	 box 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	,	for	him	,	 s 	 port 	 	is	the	language	that	 allow 	 s 	 	him	to	 en 	 counter 	 	the	full	width	and	wonder	of	the	world	.
for	some	of	us	it	might	be	music	.	for	some	of	us	it	might	be	food	.
for	a	lot	of	us	it	might	be	 liter 	 ature 	 	or	writing	.
but	there	are	all	these	different	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	that	allow	you	to	go	out	and	look	at	the	world	and	find	your	place	 with 	 in 	 	it	.
the	goal	of	my	talk	here	is	not	to	 persuad 	 e 	 	the	people	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	to	embrace	your	 xeno 	 philia 	 	.
my	guess	--	 give 	 n 	 	that	you	're	at	a	 con 	 ference 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	tedglobal	--	is	that	most	of	you	are	 xeno 	 phil 	 es 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	you	use	that	term	.
my	 challeng 	 e 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	's	not	 en 	 ough 	 	to	make	the	personal	decision	that	you	want	a	 wide 	 r 	 	world	.
we	have	to	figure	out	how	to	 re 	 wire 	 	the	 system 	 s 	 	that	we	have	.
we	have	to	fix	our	media	.
we	have	to	fix	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.	we	have	to	fix	our	education	.	we	have	to	fix	our	 im 	 migr 	 ation 	 	policy	.
we	need	to	look	at	ways	of	creating	 s 	 er 	 en 	 dip 	 ity 	 	,	of	making	 transl 	 ation 	 	pervasive	,	and	we	need	to	find	ways	to	embrace	and	 celebr 	 ate 	 	these	bridge	 figure 	 s 	 	.	and	we	need	to	figure	out	how	to	 cultiv 	 ate 	 	 xeno 	 phil 	 es 	 	.
that	's	what	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	.	i	need	your	help	.
