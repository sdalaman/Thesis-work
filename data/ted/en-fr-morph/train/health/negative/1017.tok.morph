well	,	the	subject	of	difficult	 negoti 	 ation 	 	 re 	 mind 	 s 	 	me	of	one	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	from	the	middle	east	,	of	a	man	who	left	to	his	three	 son 	 s 	 	17	 camel 	 s 	 	.
to	the	first	son	,	he	left	half	the	 camel 	 s 	 	.	to	the	second	son	,	he	left	a	third	of	the	 camel 	 s 	 	,	and	to	the	 young 	 est 	 	son	,	he	left	a	 n 	 in 	 th 	 	of	the	 camel 	 s 	 	.
well	three	 son 	 s 	 	got	 in 	 to 	 	a	 negoti 	 ation 	 	.
seventeen	 do 	 es 	 	n't	divide	by	two	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	divide	by	three	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	divide	by	nine	.
brotherly	 temper 	 s 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	to	get	 s 	 trained 	 	.
 final 	 ly 	 	,	in	 de 	 s 	 per 	 ation 	 	,	they	went	and	they	 consult 	 ed 	 	a	wise	old	woman	.
the	wise	old	woman	thought	about	 the 	 ir 	 	problem	for	a	long	time	,	and	 final 	 ly 	 	she	came	back	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	i	do	n't	know	if	i	can	help	you	,	but	at	 l 	 east 	 	,	if	you	want	,	you	can	have	my	camel	.	``
so	then	they	had	18	 camel 	 s 	 	.
the	first	son	took	his	half	--	half	of	18	is	nine	.
the	second	son	took	his	third	--	a	third	of	18	is	six	.
the	 young 	 est 	 	son	took	his	 n 	 in 	 th 	 	--	a	 n 	 in 	 th 	 	of	18	is	two	.
you	get	17	.
they	had	one	camel	left	over	.
they	 g 	 ave 	 	it	back	to	the	wise	old	woman	.
now	if	you	think	about	that	story	for	a	moment	,	i	think	it	 resemble 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	the	difficult	 negoti 	 ations 	 	we	get	 involve 	 d 	 	in	.
they	start	off	like	17	 camel 	 s 	 	--	no	way	to	 re 	 solve 	 	it	.
 some 	 how 	 	,	what	we	need	to	do	is	step	back	from	 t 	 hose 	 	 situ 	 ations 	 	,	like	that	wise	old	woman	,	look	at	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	through	fresh	 eye 	 s 	 	and	come	up	with	an	18th	camel	.
now	 find 	 ing 	 	that	18th	camel	in	the	world	's	 conflict 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	my	life	 pass 	 ion 	 	.
i	 bas 	 ically 	 	see	 human 	 ity 	 	a	bit	like	 t 	 hose 	 	three	 brother 	 s 	 	.	we	're	all	one	family	.
we	know	that	 scientific 	 ally 	 	,	 thank 	 s 	 	to	the	 communication 	 s 	 	revolution	,	all	the	 tribe 	 s 	 	on	the	planet	,	all	15,000	 tribe 	 s 	 	,	are	in	touch	with	each	other	.
and	it	's	a	big	family	 re 	 un 	 ion 	 	,
and	yet	,	like	 man 	 y 	 	family	 re 	 un 	 ions 	 	,	it	's	not	all	peace	and	light	.
there	's	a	lot	of	conflict	,
and	the	question	is	,	how	do	we	deal	with	our	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	?
how	do	we	deal	with	our	 deep 	 est 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	,	 give 	 n 	 	the	human	 prop 	 en 	 s 	 ity 	 	for	conflict	and	the	human	 gen 	 ius 	 	at	 de 	 vis 	 ing 	 	 weapon 	 s 	 	of	enormous	 destruct 	 ion 	 	?
that	's	the	question	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	've	 s 	 pent 	 	the	last	better	part	of	three	 decade 	 s 	 	,	 al 	 most 	 	four	,	 travel 	 ing 	 	the	world	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	work	,	 get 	 ting 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 conflict 	 s 	 	ranging	from	yugoslavia	to	the	middle	east	to	chechnya	to	venezuela	,	some	of	the	most	difficult	 conflict 	 s 	 	on	the	face	of	the	planet	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	 my 	 self 	 	that	question	.
and	i	think	i	've	found	,	in	some	ways	,	what	is	the	secret	to	peace	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 surprising 	 ly 	 	simple	.
it	's	not	easy	,	but	it	's	simple	.
it	's	not	even	new	.
it	may	be	one	of	our	most	ancient	human	 heritage 	 s 	 	.
the	secret	to	peace	is	us	.
it	's	us	who	act	 a 	 s 	 	the	 surround 	 ing 	 	community	around	any	conflict	,	who	can	play	a	 construct 	 ive 	 	role	.
let	me	give	you	just	a	story	,	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
about	20	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	was	in	south	africa	 work 	 ing 	 	with	the	 part 	 ies 	 	in	that	conflict	,	and	i	had	an	extra	month	,	so	i	 s 	 pent 	 	some	time	living	with	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 group 	 s 	 	of	san	bushmen	.
i	was	 cur 	 ious 	 	about	them	and	about	the	way	in	which	they	 re 	 solve 	 	conflict	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	after	all	,	 with 	 in 	 	living	 memor 	 y 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 hunter 	 s 	 	and	 gatherer 	 s 	 	,	living	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	like	our	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	lived	for	 may 	 be 	 	99	percent	of	the	human	story	.
and	all	the	men	have	these	poison	 arrow 	 s 	 	that	they	use	for	 hunt 	 ing 	 	--	 absolute 	 ly 	 	fatal	.
so	how	do	they	deal	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	?
well	what	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	is	 when 	 ever 	 	 temper 	 s 	 	rise	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	,	 some 	 one 	 	 go 	 es 	 	and	 hide 	 s 	 	the	poison	 arrow 	 s 	 	out	in	the	bush	,	and	then	 every 	 one 	 	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	around	in	a	circle	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	they	 s 	 it 	 	,	and	they	talk	,	and	they	talk	.
it	may	take	two	 day 	 s 	 	,	three	 day 	 s 	 	,	four	 day 	 s 	 	,	but	they	do	n't	rest	 un 	 til 	 	they	find	a	 re 	 solution 	 	,	or	better	yet	,	a	 reconcili 	 ation 	 	.
and	if	 temper 	 s 	 	are	still	too	high	,	then	they	 s 	 end 	 	 some 	 one 	 	off	to	visit	some	 relat 	 ive 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 cool 	 ing 	 	-	off	period	.
well	that	system	is	,	i	think	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	system	that	 ke 	 pt 	 	us	 al 	 ive 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	 give 	 n 	 	our	human	 tend 	 encies 	 	.
that	system	,	i	call	the	``	third	side	.	``
 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	think	about	it	,	 normal 	 ly 	 	when	we	think	of	conflict	,	when	we	 de 	 scribe 	 	it	,	there	's	 al 	 ways 	 	two	 side 	 s 	 	--
it	's	arabs	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	israelis	,	labor	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	management	,	husband	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	wife	,	republicans	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	 democrat 	 s 	 	.	but	what	we	do	n't	often	see	is	that	there	's	 al 	 ways 	 	a	third	side	,
and	the	third	side	of	the	conflict	is	us	,	it	's	the	 surround 	 ing 	 	community	,	it	's	the	 friend 	 s 	 	,	the	 al 	 lies 	 	,	the	family	 member 	 s 	 	,	the	 neighbor 	 s 	 	.
and	we	can	play	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 construct 	 ive 	 	role	.
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	the	most	fundamental	way	in	which	the	third	side	can	help	is	to	 re 	 mind 	 	the	 part 	 ies 	 	of	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	at	 s 	 take 	 	.
for	the	sake	of	the	 kid 	 s 	 	,	for	the	sake	of	the	family	,	for	the	sake	of	the	community	,	for	the	sake	of	the	future	,	let	's	stop	 fight 	 ing 	 	for	a	moment	and	start	 talk 	 ing 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	the	thing	is	,	when	we	're	 involve 	 d 	 	in	conflict	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	to	lose	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	to	react	.
human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	--	we	're	 re 	 action 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	the	 say 	 ing 	 	 go 	 es 	 	,	when	 ang 	 ry 	 	,	you	will	make	the	best	speech	you	will	ever	regret	.
and	so	the	third	side	 re 	 mind 	 s 	 	us	of	that	.
the	third	side	 help 	 s 	 	us	go	to	the	 balc 	 ony 	 	,	which	is	a	metaphor	for	a	place	of	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	where	we	can	keep	our	 eye 	 s 	 	on	the	prize	.
let	me	tell	you	a	little	story	from	my	own	 negoti 	 ating 	 	experience	.
some	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	was	 involve 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	facilitator	in	some	 ver 	 y 	 	tough	 talk 	 s 	 	between	the	 lead 	 ers 	 	of	russia	and	the	 lead 	 ers 	 	of	chechnya	.
there	was	a	war	going	on	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	know	.
and	we	met	in	the	hague	,	in	the	peace	 pa 	 lace 	 	,	in	the	same	room	where	the	yugoslav	war	 crime 	 s 	 	 trib 	 un 	 al 	 	was	taking	place	.
and	the	 talk 	 s 	 	got	off	to	a	 ra 	 ther 	 	 rock 	 y 	 	start	when	the	vice	 p 	 resident 	 	of	chechnya	 beg 	 an 	 	by	 point 	 ing 	 	at	the	russians	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	should	stay	right	here	in	your	 seat 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	going	to	be	on	trial	for	war	 crime 	 s 	 	.	``
and	then	he	went	on	,	and	then	he	 turn 	 ed 	 	to	me	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	're	an	american	.
look	at	what	you	americans	are	 do 	 ing 	 	in	puerto	rico	.	``
and	my	mind	 start 	 ed 	 	 rac 	 ing 	 	,	``	puerto	rico	?	what	do	i	know	about	puerto	rico	?	``
i	 start 	 ed 	 	 react 	 ing 	 	,	but	then	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	remember	to	go	to	the	 balc 	 ony 	 	.
and	then	when	he	 pause 	 d 	 	,	and	 every 	 one 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	at	me	for	a	 respons 	 e 	 	,	from	a	 balc 	 ony 	 	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	i	was	able	to	thank	him	for	his	 remark 	 s 	 	and	say	,	``	i	appreciate	your	 critic 	 ism 	 	of	my	country	,	and	i	take	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	sign	that	we	're	among	 friend 	 s 	 	and	can	speak	 candid 	 ly 	 	to	one	 an 	 other 	 	.
and	what	we	're	here	to	do	is	not	to	talk	about	puerto	rico	or	the	past	.
what	we	're	here	to	do	is	to	see	if	we	can	figure	out	a	way	to	stop	the	 suffer 	 ing 	 	and	the	 blood 	 shed 	 	in	chechnya	.	``
the	conversation	got	back	on	track	.
that	's	the	role	of	the	third	side	,	is	to	help	the	 part 	 ies 	 	to	go	to	the	 balc 	 ony 	 	.
now	let	me	take	you	for	a	moment	to	what	's	 wide 	 ly 	 	 regard 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	world	's	most	difficult	conflict	,	or	the	most	 im 	 possible 	 	conflict	,	is	the	middle	east	.
question	is	:	where	's	the	third	side	there	?
how	could	we	possibly	go	to	the	 balc 	 ony 	 	?
now	i	do	n't	pretend	to	have	an	answer	to	the	middle	east	conflict	,	but	i	think	i	've	got	a	first	step	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	a	first	step	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	any	one	of	us	could	do	 a 	 s 	 	third	-	siders	.
let	me	just	ask	you	one	question	first	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	in	the	last	 year 	 s 	 	have	ever	found	 your 	 self 	 	 worry 	 ing 	 	about	the	middle	east	and	 wonder 	 ing 	 	what	 any 	 one 	 	could	do	?
just	out	of	curiosity	,	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	?
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	the	great	 major 	 ity 	 	of	us	.
and	here	,	it	's	so	far	away	.
why	do	we	pay	so	much	attention	to	 th 	 is 	 	conflict	?
is	it	the	number	of	 death 	 s 	 	?
there	are	a	hundred	 time 	 s 	 	more	people	who	die	in	a	conflict	in	africa	than	in	the	middle	east	.
no	,	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	story	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	feel	 personal 	 ly 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	that	story	.
 whet 	 her 	 	we	're	christians	,	muslims	or	jews	,	religious	or	non	-	religious	,	we	feel	we	have	a	personal	 s 	 take 	 	in	it	.
 st 	 ories 	 	matter	.	 a 	 s 	 	an	 anthropo 	 logist 	 	,	i	know	that	.
 st 	 ories 	 	are	what	we	use	to	transmit	knowledge	.
they	give	meaning	to	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
that	's	what	we	tell	here	at	ted	,	we	tell	 st 	 ories 	 	.
 st 	 ories 	 	are	the	key	.
and	so	my	question	is	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	let	's	try	and	 re 	 solve 	 	the	 politic 	 s 	 	there	in	the	middle	east	,	but	let	's	 al 	 so 	 	take	a	look	at	the	story	.
let	's	try	to	get	at	the	root	of	what	it	's	all	about	.
let	's	see	if	we	can	 app 	 ly 	 	the	third	side	to	it	.
what	would	that	mean	?	what	is	the	story	there	?
now	 a 	 s 	 	 anthropo 	 logists 	 	,	we	know	that	every	culture	 ha 	 s 	 	an	origin	story	.
what	's	the	origin	story	of	the	middle	east	?
in	a	phrase	,	it	's	:	4,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	a	man	and	his	family	 walk 	 ed 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	middle	east	,	and	the	world	 ha 	 s 	 	never	 be 	 en 	 	the	same	since	.
that	man	,	of	course	,	was	abraham	.
and	what	he	stood	for	was	 un 	 ity 	 	,	the	 un 	 ity 	 	of	the	family	.
he	's	the	father	of	us	all	.
but	it	's	not	just	what	he	stood	for	,	it	's	what	his	 mess 	 age 	 	was	.
his	 bas 	 ic 	 	 mess 	 age 	 	was	 un 	 ity 	 	too	,	the	 interconnect 	 ed 	 ness 	 	of	it	all	,	the	 un 	 ity 	 	of	it	all	,
and	his	 bas 	 ic 	 	value	was	respect	,	was	 kind 	 ness 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	 strange 	 rs 	 	.
that	's	what	he	's	known	for	,	his	 hospital 	 ity 	 	.
so	in	that	sense	,	he	's	the	 symbol 	 ic 	 	third	side	of	the	middle	east	.
he	's	the	one	who	 re 	 mind 	 s 	 	us	that	we	're	all	part	of	a	 great 	 er 	 	whole	.
now	how	would	you	--	now	think	about	that	for	a	moment	.
 to 	 day 	 	we	face	the	 scour 	 ge 	 	of	 terror 	 ism 	 	.
what	is	 terror 	 ism 	 	?
 terror 	 ism 	 	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	taking	an	 innoc 	 ent 	 	 strange 	 r 	 	and	 treat 	 ing 	 	them	 a 	 s 	 	an	 ene 	 my 	 	whom	you	kill	in	order	to	create	fear	.
what	's	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	of	 terror 	 ism 	 	?
it	's	taking	an	 innoc 	 ent 	 	 strange 	 r 	 	and	 treat 	 ing 	 	them	 a 	 s 	 	a	friend	whom	you	welcome	 in 	 to 	 	your	home	in	order	to	 s 	 ow 	 	and	create	 understand 	 ing 	 	,	or	respect	,	or	love	.
so	what	if	then	you	took	the	story	of	abraham	,	which	is	a	third	side	story	,	what	if	that	could	be	--	 be 	 cause 	 	abraham	 stand 	 s 	 	for	 hospital 	 ity 	 	--	what	if	that	could	be	an	antidote	to	 terror 	 ism 	 	?
what	if	that	could	be	a	 vaccin 	 e 	 	against	religious	 in 	 toler 	 ance 	 	?
how	would	you	 br 	 ing 	 	that	story	to	life	?
now	it	's	not	 en 	 ough 	 	just	to	tell	a	story	--	that	's	 power 	 ful 	 	--	but	people	need	to	experience	the	story	.
they	need	to	be	able	to	live	the	story	.	how	would	you	do	that	?
and	that	was	my	 think 	 ing 	 	of	how	would	you	do	that	.
and	that	's	what	 come 	 s 	 	to	the	first	step	here	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	simple	way	to	do	that	is	you	go	for	a	walk	.
you	go	for	a	walk	in	the	 foot 	 step 	 s 	 	of	abraham	.
you	 re 	 trace 	 	the	 foot 	 step 	 s 	 	of	abraham	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 walk 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	real	power	.
you	know	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	 anthropo 	 logist 	 	,	 walk 	 ing 	 	is	what	made	us	human	.
 walk 	 ing 	 	,	it	's	funny	,	when	you	walk	,	you	walk	side	-	by	-	side	in	the	same	common	direction	.
now	if	i	 we 	 re 	 	to	come	to	you	face	-	to	-	face	and	come	 th 	 is 	 	close	to	you	,	you	would	feel	 threaten 	 ed 	 	.
but	if	i	walk	shoulder	-	to	-	shoulder	,	even	 touch 	 ing 	 	 shoulder 	 s 	 	,	it	's	no	problem	.
who	 fight 	 s 	 	while	they	walk	?
that	's	why	in	 negoti 	 ations 	 	,	often	,	when	 thing 	 s 	 	get	tough	,	people	go	for	 walk 	 s 	 	in	the	 wood 	 s 	 	.
so	the	idea	came	to	me	of	what	about	inspiring	a	path	,	a	route	--	think	the	silk	route	,	think	the	appalachian	trail	--	that	 follow 	 ed 	 	in	the	 foot 	 step 	 s 	 	of	abraham	.
people	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	that	's	crazy	.	you	ca	n't	.
you	ca	n't	 re 	 trace 	 	the	 foot 	 step 	 s 	 	of	abraham	.	it	's	too	 in 	 secure 	 	.
you	've	got	to	cross	all	these	 border 	 s 	 	.
it	 go 	 es 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	10	different	 count 	 ries 	 	in	the	middle	east	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 un 	 ites 	 	them	all	.	``
and	so	we	 stud 	 ied 	 	the	idea	at	harvard	.
we	did	our	due	 di 	 lig 	 ence 	 	.
and	then	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	a	group	of	us	,	about	25	of	us	from	about	10	different	 count 	 ries 	 	,	 decide 	 d 	 	to	see	if	we	could	 re 	 trace 	 	the	 foot 	 step 	 s 	 	of	abraham	,	going	from	his	 initi 	 al 	 	 birth 	 place 	 	in	the	city	of	urfa	in	southern	 tur 	 key 	 	,	 north 	 ern 	 	mesopotamia	.
and	we	then	took	a	bus	and	took	some	 walk 	 s 	 	and	went	to	harran	,	where	,	in	the	 b 	 ible 	 	,	he	 set 	 s 	 	off	on	his	journey	.
then	we	 cross 	 ed 	 	the	border	 in 	 to 	 	syria	,	went	to	aleppo	,	which	,	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	is	named	after	abraham	.
we	went	to	damascus	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	a	long	 histo 	 ry 	 	 associate 	 d 	 	with	abraham	.
we	then	came	to	 north 	 ern 	 	jordan	,	to	jerusalem	,	which	is	all	about	abraham	,	to	bethlehem	,	and	 final 	 ly 	 	to	the	place	where	he	's	buried	in	hebron	.
so	 effective 	 ly 	 	,	we	went	from	womb	to	tomb	.
we	 show 	 ed 	 	it	could	be	 d 	 one 	 	.	it	was	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	journey	.
let	me	ask	you	a	question	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	have	had	the	experience	of	 be 	 ing 	 	in	a	strange	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	,	or	strange	land	,	and	a	total	 strange 	 r 	 	,	perfect	 strange 	 r 	 	,	 come 	 s 	 	up	to	you	and	 show 	 s 	 	you	some	 kind 	 ness 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	 invit 	 es 	 	you	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	home	,	 give 	 s 	 	you	a	drink	,	 give 	 s 	 	you	a	coffee	,	 give 	 s 	 	you	a	meal	?
how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	have	ever	had	that	experience	?
that	's	the	 es 	 s 	 ence 	 	of	the	abraham	path	.
but	that	's	what	you	discover	,	is	you	go	 in 	 to 	 	these	 village 	 s 	 	in	the	middle	east	where	you	expect	 hostil 	 ity 	 	,	and	you	get	the	most	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 hospital 	 ity 	 	,	all	 associate 	 d 	 	with	abraham	.
``	in	the	name	of	father	abraham	,	let	me	 off 	 er 	 	you	some	food	.	``
so	what	we	 discover 	 ed 	 	is	that	abraham	is	not	just	a	figure	out	of	a	book	for	 t 	 hose 	 	people	.	he	's	 al 	 ive 	 	;	he	's	a	living	presence	.
and	to	make	a	long	story	short	,	in	the	last	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	now	,	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	have	 beg 	 un 	 	to	walk	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	path	of	abraham	in	the	middle	east	,	 enjoy 	 ing 	 	the	 hospital 	 ity 	 	of	the	people	there	.
they	've	 beg 	 un 	 	to	walk	in	israel	and	palestine	,	in	jordan	,	in	 tur 	 key 	 	,	in	syria	.
it	's	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	experience	.
men	,	women	,	young	people	,	old	people	--	more	women	than	men	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	.
for	 t 	 hose 	 	who	ca	n't	walk	,	who	are	 un 	 able 	 	to	get	there	right	now	,	people	 start 	 ed 	 	to	organize	 walk 	 s 	 	in	cities	,	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 commun 	 ities 	 	.
in	cincinnati	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	that	 organize 	 d 	 	a	walk	from	a	church	to	a	mosque	to	a	 s 	 y 	 nag 	 ogue 	 	and	all	had	an	abrahamic	meal	together	.
it	was	abraham	path	day	.
in	sao	paulo	,	brazil	,	it	's	 be 	 come 	 	an	annual	event	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	to	run	in	a	virtual	abraham	path	run	,	 unit 	 ing 	 	the	different	 commun 	 ities 	 	.
the	media	love	it	;	they	 re 	 ally 	 	 ador 	 e 	 	it	.
they	lavish	attention	on	it	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	visual	,	and	it	 spread 	 s 	 	the	idea	,	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	abrahamic	 hospital 	 ity 	 	of	 kind 	 ness 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 strange 	 rs 	 	.
and	just	a	couple	 week 	 s 	 	ago	,	there	was	an	npr	story	on	it	.
last	month	,	there	was	a	piece	in	the	 guard 	 ian 	 	,	in	the	manchester	 guard 	 ian 	 	,	about	it	--	two	whole	 page 	 s 	 	.
and	they	 quote 	 d 	 	a	 village 	 r 	 	who	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	walk	 connect 	 s 	 	us	to	the	world	.	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	it	was	like	a	light	that	went	on	in	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
it	 br 	 ought 	 	us	hope	.
and	so	that	's	what	it	's	about	.
but	it	's	not	just	about	 psycho 	 logy 	 	;	it	's	about	 economic 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 a 	 s 	 	people	walk	they	 s 	 pend 	 	money	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	woman	right	here	,	um	ahmad	,	is	a	woman	who	 live 	 s 	 	on	a	path	in	 north 	 ern 	 	jordan	.
she	's	 desperate 	 ly 	 	poor	.
she	's	 partial 	 ly 	 	blind	,	her	husband	ca	n't	work	,	she	's	got	seven	 kid 	 s 	 	.
but	what	she	can	do	is	cook	,
and	so	she	's	 beg 	 un 	 	to	cook	for	some	 group 	 s 	 	of	 walk 	 ers 	 	who	come	through	the	village	and	have	a	meal	in	her	home	.
they	 s 	 it 	 	on	the	floor	.
she	 do 	 es 	 	n't	even	have	a	 table 	 cloth 	 	.
she	 make 	 s 	 	the	most	 delic 	 ious 	 	food	that	's	fresh	from	the	 herb 	 s 	 	in	the	 surround 	 ing 	 	 country 	 side 	 	.
and	so	more	and	more	 walk 	 ers 	 	have	come	,
and	 late 	 ly 	 	she	's	 beg 	 un 	 	to	earn	an	income	to	support	her	family	.
and	so	she	told	our	team	there	,	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	have	made	me	visible	in	a	village	where	people	 we 	 re 	 	once	 a 	 shame 	 d 	 	to	look	at	me	.	``
that	's	the	potential	of	the	abraham	path	.
there	are	 liter 	 ally 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 commun 	 ities 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	middle	east	,	 a 	 cross 	 	the	path	.
the	potential	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	to	change	the	game	.
and	to	change	the	game	,	you	have	to	change	the	frame	,	the	way	we	see	 thing 	 s 	 	--	to	change	the	frame	from	 hostil 	 ity 	 	to	 hospital 	 ity 	 	,	from	 terror 	 ism 	 	to	 tour 	 ism 	 	.
and	in	that	sense	,	the	abraham	path	is	a	game	-	changer	.
let	me	just	show	you	one	thing	.
i	have	a	little	 a 	 corn 	 	here	that	i	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	while	i	was	 walk 	 ing 	 	on	the	path	 ear 	 lier 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	.
now	the	 a 	 corn 	 	is	 associate 	 d 	 	with	the	oak	tree	,	of	course	--	 grow 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	an	oak	tree	,	which	is	 associate 	 d 	 	with	abraham	.
the	path	right	now	is	like	an	 a 	 corn 	 	;	it	's	still	in	 it 	 s 	 	early	phase	.
what	would	the	oak	tree	look	like	?
well	i	think	back	to	my	 child 	 hood 	 	,	a	good	part	of	which	i	 s 	 pent 	 	,	after	 be 	 ing 	 	born	here	in	chicago	,	i	 s 	 pent 	 	in	europe	.
if	you	had	 be 	 en 	 	in	the	 ruin 	 s 	 	of	,	say	,	london	in	1945	,	or	berlin	,	and	you	had	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	sixty	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	be	the	most	 peace 	 ful 	 	,	 prosper 	 ous 	 	part	of	the	planet	,	``	people	would	have	thought	you	 we 	 re 	 	 cert 	 ifiably 	 	 insan 	 e 	 	.
but	they	did	it	 thank 	 s 	 	to	a	common	 ident 	 ity 	 	--	europe	--	and	a	common	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
so	my	question	is	,	if	it	can	be	 d 	 one 	 	in	europe	,	why	not	in	the	middle	east	?
why	not	,	 thank 	 s 	 	to	a	common	 ident 	 ity 	 	,	which	is	the	story	of	abraham	,	and	 thank 	 s 	 	to	a	common	 eco 	 nomy 	 	that	would	be	based	in	good	part	on	 tour 	 ism 	 	?
so	let	me	conclude	then	by	 say 	 ing 	 	that	in	the	last	35	 year 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	've	 work 	 ed 	 	in	some	of	the	most	 danger 	 ous 	 	,	difficult	and	intractable	 conflict 	 s 	 	around	the	planet	,	i	have	yet	to	see	one	conflict	that	i	felt	could	not	be	 transform 	 ed 	 	.
it	's	not	easy	,	of	course	,	but	it	's	possible	.
it	was	 d 	 one 	 	in	south	africa	.
it	was	 d 	 one 	 	in	 north 	 ern 	 	ireland	.
it	could	be	 d 	 one 	 	 any 	 where 	 	.
it	 simpl 	 y 	 	 depend 	 s 	 	on	us	.
it	 depend 	 s 	 	on	us	taking	the	third	side	.
so	let	me	 invit 	 e 	 	you	to	consider	taking	the	third	side	,	even	 a 	 s 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	step	.
we	're	about	to	take	a	break	in	a	moment	.
just	go	up	to	 some 	 one 	 	who	's	from	a	different	culture	,	a	different	country	,	a	different	 ethnic 	 ity 	 	,	some	 differ 	 ence 	 	,	and	engage	them	in	a	conversation	;	listen	to	them	.
that	's	a	third	side	act	.
that	's	 walk 	 ing 	 	abraham	's	path	.
after	a	tedtalk	,	why	not	a	tedwalk	?
so	let	me	just	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	three	 thing 	 s 	 	.
one	is	,	the	secret	to	peace	is	the	third	side	.
the	third	side	is	us	.	each	of	us	,	with	a	single	step	,	can	take	the	world	,	can	 br 	 ing 	 	the	world	a	step	 close 	 r 	 	to	peace	.
there	's	an	old	african	 pro 	 verb 	 	that	 go 	 es 	 	:	``	when	spider	 web 	 s 	 	 un 	 ite 	 	,	they	can	halt	even	the	lion	.	``
if	we	're	able	to	 un 	 ite 	 	our	third	-	side	 web 	 s 	 	of	peace	,	we	can	even	halt	the	lion	of	war	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
