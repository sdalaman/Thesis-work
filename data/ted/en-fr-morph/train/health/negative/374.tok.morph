 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 fused 	 	his	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	right	there	with	him	.
and	then	he	had	to	 clar 	 ify 	 	that	he	was	n't	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	them	.

fermi	's	 reason 	 ing 	 	,	if	i	may	 para 	 phrase 	 	 bad 	 ly 	 	,	is	that	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	so	vast	that	it	 stand 	 s 	 	to	reason	,	there	should	be	other	intelligent	life	out	there	.
and	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	so	old	that	 un 	 less 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	 civil 	 ization 	 	ever	to	evolve	,	we	should	have	some	evidence	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 exist 	 ence 	 	by	now	.
and	yet	,	to	the	best	of	our	knowledge	,	we	are	 al 	 one 	 	.
``	where	is	 every 	 body 	 	?	``	 ask 	 ed 	 	fermi	,	and	his	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	had	no	answer	.

now	,	i	am	not	a	scientist	.
i	have	never	built	an	atomic	pile	.
 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	,	i	might	 argu 	 e 	 	that	,	 technical 	 ly 	 	,	every	pile	is	atomic	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	with	respect	,	i	might	point	out	two	 possibil 	 ities 	 	that	enrico	fermi	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	did	not	consider	.
one	is	that	the	 alien 	 s 	 	might	be	 ver 	 y 	 	far	away	.
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	i	 da 	 re 	 	say	,	even	on	other	 planet 	 s 	 	.
the	other	 possibil 	 ity 	 	--	--	is	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	enrico	fermi	 him 	 self 	 	was	an	alien	.
think	about	it	.
is	n't	it	a	little	convenient	that	in	the	 mid 	 st 	 	of	the	world	war	,	out	of	 no 	 where 	 	,	 sudden 	 ly 	 	an	italian	scientist	 show 	 ed 	 	up	with	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	new	technology	that	would	transform	 every 	 thing 	 	in	the	world	and	 dark 	 en 	 	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	the	human	species	 fore 	 ver 	 	after	?
and	is	n't	it	a	little	strange	that	he	 requir 	 ed 	 	no	payment	for	 th 	 is 	 	?
that	he	 ask 	 ed 	 	for	 on 	 ly 	 	one	thing	--	a	gift	of	two	 health 	 y 	 	 s 	 perm 	 	 whale 	 s 	 	?
that	's	--	that	's	not	true	.

for	even	in	my	own	life	,	there	are	 memor 	 ies 	 	i	have	that	are	difficult	to	explain	--	 happen 	 ing 	 s 	 	that	are	so	odd	and	 un 	 account 	 ably 	 	weird	,	that	it	is	difficult	to	imagine	they	 we 	 re 	 	not	the	result	of	 pro 	 long 	 ed 	 	and	frequent	contact	with	 alien 	 s 	 	 through 	 out 	 	my	life	.

and	there	i	was	 chase 	 d 	 	by	a	pack	of	 fer 	 al 	 	 dog 	 s 	 	on	the	dock	,	and	the	lead	dog	bit	me	on	the	ass	,	 requir 	 ing 	 	me	to	go	to	a	strange	portuguese	clinic	and	 receiv 	 e 	 	an	ass	shot	.
make	of	that	what	you	will	.
our	last	day	in	portugal	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	in	the	 di 	 strict 	 	capital	of	faro	,	and	catherine	 decide 	 d 	 	that	she	 want 	 ed 	 	to	go	to	the	beach	one	last	time	.
now	,	faro	is	a	 bust 	 ling 	 	little	city	,	and	to	get	to	the	beach	,	she	 explain 	 ed 	 	,	you	would	have	to	take	a	bus	and	then	a	boat	.
and	did	i	want	to	come	with	?
but	i	was	 exhaust 	 ed 	 	and	dog	-	bitten	,	and	so	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no.	``
i	remember	what	she	 look 	 ed 	 	like	before	she	left	.
the	 fre 	 ck 	 les 	 	had	grown	and	 multi 	 plied 	 	on	her	face	and	 shoulder 	 s 	 	,	 cluster 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	kind	of	a	tan	.
a	tan	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	both	tan	--
is	 th 	 is 	 	true	?
her	 eye 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	extra	bright	and	extra	blue	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	.
she	was	 smil 	 ing 	 	.
she	was	a	single	woman	about	to	go	 al 	 one 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	country	,	not	even	 s 	 peaking 	 	the	language	,	to	travel	 al 	 one 	 	by	bus	and	boat	to	go	to	a	beach	she	did	not	know	or	had	never	 s 	 een 	 	.
i	 love 	 d 	 	her	,	and	then	she	went	out	 in 	 to 	 	that	strange	,	alien	land	.
it	took	me	some	time	to	come	to	my	 sense 	 s 	 	.
i	had	my	own	``	lost	time	``	moment	,	where	i	 wok 	 e 	 	up	and	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 real 	 ized 	 	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	late	in	the	day	,	 al 	 most 	 	 d 	 inner 	 time 	 	,	and	she	had	not	come	back	.
nervous	,	i	went	down	to	the	street	to	look	for	her	.
now	,	i	did	not	speak	portuguese	.
i	did	not	know	where	the	beach	was	.
i	could	not	call	her	on	a	cell	phone	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	was	1991	,	and	the	 alien 	 s 	 	had	not	 give 	 n 	 	us	that	technology	yet	.
i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	the	day	would	 on 	 ly 	 	have	two	possible	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	:	either	catherine	would	come	back	to	the	hotel	,	or	she	would	never	come	back	to	the	hotel	.
and	so	i	 s 	 at 	 	down	to	wait	.
i	did	not	watch	the	 ski 	 es 	 	,	but	the	 ver 	 y 	 	end	of	the	street	where	the	 bus 	 es 	 	and	 car 	 s 	 	and	 pedestrian 	 s 	 	and	little	 s 	 cooter 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	moving	 a 	 long 	 	.
and	i	 watch 	 ed 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 con 	 s 	 tell 	 ations 	 	shift	,	 hop 	 ing 	 	that	they	would	part	and	i	would	see	her	face	.
it	was	at	that	moment	,	in	that	 ver 	 y 	 	small	town	of	30,000	or	so	,	that	i	 tru 	 ly 	 	 appreciate 	 d 	 	the	 vast 	 ness 	 	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	and	the	 search 	 ing 	 	we	might	do	in	it	.
and	that	's	when	the	liberians	came	 a 	 long 	 	.
five	young	men	--	all	 laugh 	 ing 	 	,	happy	,	 travel 	 ing 	 	together	,	coming	back	to	 th 	 is 	 	hotel	where	they	 we 	 re 	 	 stay 	 ing 	 	.
one	of	them	was	named	joseph	,	and	he	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	what	was	i	 do 	 ing 	 	,	and	i	 explain 	 ed 	 	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	do	n't	worry	.	``	he	was	 s 	 ure 	 	that	catherine	would	be	safe	.
but	he	did	not	seem	so	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	,	for	he	 s 	 at 	 	down	to	wait	with	me	.
and	for	the	next	two	 hour 	 s 	 	,	they	all	 wait 	 ed 	 	with	me	:	taking	 turn 	 s 	 	,	going	up	to	 the 	 ir 	 	room	,	coming	back	,	 tell 	 ing 	 	me	 joke 	 s 	 	,	 distract 	 ing 	 	me	.
two	 hour 	 s 	 	,	they	 g 	 ave 	 	me	a	 mess 	 age 	 	.
we	are	not	 al 	 one 	 	.
and	then	,	in	the	middle	of	a	sentence	,	at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	birth	of	 t 	 wi 	 light 	 	,	i	 turn 	 ed 	 	and	 look 	 ed 	 	down	the	street	.
the	 star 	 s 	 	 align 	 ed 	 	,	and	she	came	back	.
she	was	 smil 	 ing 	 	.	she	did	not	understand	why	i	was	so	 worri 	 ed 	 	.
 n 	 either 	 	did	the	liberians	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	there	was	a	huge	amount	of	relief	in	 the 	 ir 	 	laughter	 a 	 s 	 	they	 clap 	 ped 	 	us	on	the	back	,	and	went	back	up	to	 the 	 ir 	 	room	and	left	us	 al 	 one 	 	in	the	street	,	 hold 	 ing 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	.
an	event	like	 th 	 is 	 	 leav 	 es 	 	a	scar	on	the	 memor 	 y 	 	,	much	like	a	piece	of	alien	technology	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 insert 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	your	 buttock 	 s 	 	by	a	``	portuguese	doctor	.	``
and	even	now	,	a	decade	and	a	half	 lat 	 er 	 	,	even	now	that	we	are	married	,	i	look	for	her	still	,	 when 	 ever 	 	she	is	not	in	the	room	.
and	even	 th 	 ough 	 	,	i	think	you	'll	agree	,	it	is	 prob 	 able 	 	that	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	time	she	was	away	,	she	was	 kidnap 	 ped 	 	and	 replace 	 d 	 	by	an	alien	clone	,	i	love	her	and	wait	for	her	still	.
thank	you	for	your	kind	attention	.
