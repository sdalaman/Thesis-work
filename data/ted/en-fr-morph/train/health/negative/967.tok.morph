we	live	in	in	a	 remark 	 able 	 	time	,	the	age	of	 genomic 	 s 	 	.
your	genome	is	the	entire	sequence	of	your	dna	.
your	sequence	and	mine	are	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	different	.
that	's	why	we	look	different	.
i	've	got	 brow 	 n 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	;
you	might	have	blue	or	gray	.
but	it	's	not	just	skin	-	deep	.
the	 head 	 lines 	 	tell	us	that	 gene 	 s 	 	can	give	us	 scar 	 y 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	even	shape	our	 personal 	 ity 	 	,	or	give	us	mental	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	.
our	 gene 	 s 	 	seem	to	have	awesome	power	over	our	 de 	 s 	 tin 	 ies 	 	.
and	yet	,	i	would	like	to	think	that	i	am	more	than	my	 gene 	 s 	 	.
what	do	you	 guy 	 s 	 	think	?
are	you	more	than	your	 gene 	 s 	 	?
 y 	 es 	 	?
i	think	some	people	agree	with	me	.
i	think	we	should	make	a	 state 	 ment 	 	.
i	think	we	should	say	it	all	together	.
all	right	:	``	i	'm	more	than	my	 gene 	 s 	 	``	--	all	together	.
 every 	 body 	 	:	i	am	more	than	my	 gene 	 s 	 	.
sebastian	seung	:	what	am	i	?
i	am	my	 connect 	 ome 	 	.
now	,	since	you	 guy 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	great	,	 may 	 be 	 	you	can	humor	me	and	say	 th 	 is 	 	all	together	too	.
right	.	all	together	now	.
 every 	 body 	 	:	i	am	my	 connect 	 ome 	 	.
ss	:	that	 sound 	 ed 	 	great	.
you	know	,	you	 guy 	 s 	 	are	so	great	,	you	do	n't	even	know	what	a	 connect 	 ome 	 	is	,	and	you	're	 will 	 ing 	 	to	play	 a 	 long 	 	with	me	.
i	could	just	go	home	now	.
well	,	so	far	 on 	 ly 	 	one	 connect 	 ome 	 	is	known	,	that	of	 th 	 is 	 	 tin 	 y 	 	worm	.
 it 	 s 	 	modest	nervous	system	 consist 	 s 	 	of	just	300	 neuro 	 ns 	 	.
and	in	the	1970s	and	'80s	,	a	team	of	 scientist 	 s 	 	 ma 	 pped 	 	all	7,000	 connect 	 ions 	 	between	the	 neuro 	 ns 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	 dia 	 gram 	 	,	every	 no 	 de 	 	is	a	 neuro 	 n 	 	,	and	every	line	is	a	 connect 	 ion 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 connect 	 ome 	 	of	the	worm	c.	 ele 	 gan 	 s 	 	.
your	 connect 	 ome 	 	is	far	more	complex	than	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	your	brain	 contain 	 s 	 	100	billion	 neuro 	 ns 	 	and	10,000	 time 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 connect 	 ions 	 	.
there	's	a	 dia 	 gram 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	for	your	brain	,	but	there	's	no	way	it	would	fit	on	 th 	 is 	 	slide	.
your	 connect 	 ome 	 	 contain 	 s 	 	one	million	 time 	 s 	 	more	 connect 	 ions 	 	than	your	genome	 ha 	 s 	 	 letter 	 s 	 	.
that	's	a	lot	of	information	.
what	's	in	that	information	?
we	do	n't	know	for	 s 	 ure 	 	,	but	there	are	 the 	 ories 	 	.
since	the	19th	century	,	 neuro 	 scientist 	 s 	 	have	 specul 	 ated 	 	that	 may 	 be 	 	your	 memor 	 ies 	 	--	the	information	that	 make 	 s 	 	you	,	you	--	 may 	 be 	 	your	 memor 	 ies 	 	are	 store 	 d 	 	in	the	 connect 	 ions 	 	between	your	brain	's	 neuro 	 ns 	 	.
and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	other	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	of	your	personal	 ident 	 ity 	 	--	 may 	 be 	 	your	 personal 	 ity 	 	and	your	 in 	 tell 	 ect 	 	--	 may 	 be 	 	they	're	 al 	 so 	 	 encode 	 d 	 	in	the	 connect 	 ions 	 	between	your	 neuro 	 ns 	 	.
and	so	now	you	can	see	why	i	 pro 	 posed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 hypo 	 thesis 	 	:	i	am	my	 connect 	 ome 	 	.
i	did	n't	ask	you	to	chant	it	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	true	;	i	just	want	you	to	remember	it	.
and	in	fact	,	we	do	n't	know	if	 th 	 is 	 	 hypo 	 thesis 	 	is	correct	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	never	had	 techno 	 logies 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	to	test	it	.
 find 	 ing 	 	that	worm	 connect 	 ome 	 	took	over	a	dozen	 year 	 s 	 	of	 ted 	 ious 	 	labor	.
and	to	find	the	 connect 	 ome 	 s 	 	of	 brain 	 s 	 	more	like	our	own	,	we	need	more	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	that	are	 autom 	 ated 	 	,	that	will	speed	up	the	process	of	 find 	 ing 	 	 connect 	 ome 	 s 	 	.
and	in	the	next	few	 minute 	 s 	 	,	i	'll	tell	you	about	some	of	these	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	which	are	 current 	 ly 	 	under	 develop 	 ment 	 	in	my	lab	and	the	 lab 	 s 	 	of	my	 collabor 	 ators 	 	.
now	you	've	 prob 	 ably 	 	 s 	 een 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	of	 neuro 	 ns 	 	before	.
you	can	 recogn 	 ize 	 	them	 instant 	 ly 	 	by	 the 	 ir 	 	fantastic	 shape 	 s 	 	.
they	extend	long	and	 delic 	 ate 	 	 branch 	 es 	 	,	and	in	short	,	they	look	like	 tree 	 s 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	a	single	 neuro 	 n 	 	.
in	order	to	find	 connect 	 ome 	 s 	 	,	we	have	to	see	all	the	 neuro 	 ns 	 	at	the	same	time	.
so	let	's	meet	bobby	kasthuri	,	who	 work 	 s 	 	in	the	 labor 	 atory 	 	of	jeff	lichtman	at	harvard	university	.
bobby	is	 hold 	 ing 	 	 fantastic 	 ally 	 	thin	 slice 	 s 	 	of	a	mouse	brain	.
and	we	're	 zoom 	 ing 	 	in	by	a	factor	of	100,000	 time 	 s 	 	to	obtain	the	 re 	 solution 	 	,	so	that	we	can	see	the	 branch 	 es 	 	of	 neuro 	 ns 	 	all	at	the	same	time	.
 ex 	 cept 	 	,	you	still	may	not	 re 	 ally 	 	 recogn 	 ize 	 	them	,	and	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	to	work	in	three	 dimension 	 s 	 	.
if	we	take	 man 	 y 	 	 image 	 s 	 	of	 man 	 y 	 	 slice 	 s 	 	of	the	brain	and	stack	them	up	,	we	get	a	three	-	dimensional	image	.
and	still	,	you	may	not	see	the	 branch 	 es 	 	.
so	we	start	at	the	top	,	and	we	color	in	the	cross	-	section	of	one	branch	in	red	,
and	we	do	that	for	the	next	slice	and	for	the	next	slice	.
and	we	keep	on	 do 	 ing 	 	that	,	slice	after	slice	.
if	we	 continu 	 e 	 	through	the	entire	stack	,	we	can	 re 	 construct 	 	the	three	-	dimensional	shape	of	a	small	fragment	of	a	branch	of	a	 neuro 	 n 	 	.
and	we	can	do	that	for	 an 	 other 	 	 neuro 	 n 	 	in	green	.
and	you	can	see	that	the	green	 neuro 	 n 	 	 touch 	 es 	 	the	red	 neuro 	 n 	 	at	two	 location 	 s 	 	,	and	these	are	what	are	 call 	 ed 	 	 synapse 	 s 	 	.
let	's	zoom	in	on	one	synapse	,
and	keep	your	 eye 	 s 	 	on	the	 in 	 terior 	 	of	the	green	 neuro 	 n 	 	.
you	should	see	small	 circle 	 s 	 	--
these	are	 call 	 ed 	 	 ves 	 icles 	 	.
they	contain	a	molecule	know	 a 	 s 	 	a	 neuro 	 transmit 	 ter 	 	.
and	so	when	the	green	 neuro 	 n 	 	 want 	 s 	 	to	communicate	,	it	 want 	 s 	 	to	 s 	 end 	 	a	 mess 	 age 	 	to	the	red	 neuro 	 n 	 	,	it	 s 	 pit 	 s 	 	out	 neuro 	 transmit 	 ter 	 	.
at	the	synapse	,	the	two	 neuro 	 ns 	 	are	 s 	 aid 	 	to	be	 connect 	 ed 	 	like	two	 friend 	 s 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	on	the	 tele 	 phone 	 	.
so	you	see	how	to	find	a	synapse	.
how	can	we	find	an	entire	 connect 	 ome 	 	?
well	,	we	take	 th 	 is 	 	three	-	dimensional	stack	of	 image 	 s 	 	and	treat	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	 gig 	 antic 	 	three	-	dimensional	 color 	 ing 	 	book	.
we	color	every	 neuro 	 n 	 	in	,	in	a	different	color	,	and	then	we	look	through	all	of	the	 image 	 s 	 	,	find	the	 synapse 	 s 	 	and	note	the	 color 	 s 	 	of	the	two	 neuro 	 ns 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	each	synapse	.
if	we	can	do	that	 through 	 out 	 	all	the	 image 	 s 	 	,	we	could	find	a	 connect 	 ome 	 	.
now	,	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	you	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	the	 bas 	 ic 	 s 	 	of	 neuro 	 ns 	 	and	 synapse 	 s 	 	.
and	so	i	think	we	're	ready	to	tackle	one	of	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 question 	 s 	 	in	 neuro 	 science 	 	:	how	are	the	 brain 	 s 	 	of	men	and	women	different	?
 accord 	 ing 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	self	-	help	book	,	 guy 	 s 	 	 brain 	 s 	 	are	like	 wa 	 ff 	 les 	 	;	they	keep	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	 compartment 	 al 	 ized 	 	in	boxes	.
 girl 	 s 	 	'	 brain 	 s 	 	are	like	spaghetti	;	 every 	 thing 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	life	is	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	 every 	 thing 	 	else	.
you	 guy 	 s 	 	are	 laugh 	 ing 	 	,	but	you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	book	 change 	 d 	 	my	life	.
but	 serious 	 ly 	 	,	what	's	wrong	with	 th 	 is 	 	?
you	 al 	 ready 	 	know	 en 	 ough 	 	to	tell	me	--	what	's	wrong	with	 th 	 is 	 	 state 	 ment 	 	?
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	 whet 	 her 	 	you	're	a	guy	or	girl	,	 every 	 one 	 	's	 brain 	 s 	 	are	like	spaghetti	.
or	 may 	 be 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	fine	 cap 	 ell 	 ini 	 	with	 branch 	 es 	 	.
just	 a 	 s 	 	one	strand	of	spaghetti	 contact 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	other	 strand 	 s 	 	on	your	plate	,	one	 neuro 	 n 	 	 touch 	 es 	 	 man 	 y 	 	other	 neuro 	 ns 	 	through	 the 	 ir 	 	 entangle 	 d 	 	 branch 	 es 	 	.
one	 neuro 	 n 	 	can	be	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	so	 man 	 y 	 	other	 neuro 	 ns 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	can	be	 synapse 	 s 	 	at	these	 point 	 s 	 	of	contact	.
by	now	,	you	might	have	sort	of	lost	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	on	how	large	 th 	 is 	 	cube	of	brain	tissue	 actual 	 ly 	 	is	.
and	so	let	's	do	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 compar 	 ison 	 s 	 	to	show	you	.
i	assure	you	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 tin 	 y 	 	.	it	's	just	six	 micro 	 ns 	 	on	a	side	.
so	,	here	's	how	it	 stack 	 s 	 	up	against	an	entire	 neuro 	 n 	 	.
and	you	can	tell	that	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 on 	 ly 	 	the	 small 	 est 	 	 fragment 	 s 	 	of	 branch 	 es 	 	are	 contain 	 ed 	 	 in 	 side 	 	 th 	 is 	 	cube	.
and	a	 neuro 	 n 	 	,	well	,	that	's	 small 	 er 	 	than	brain	.
and	that	's	just	a	mouse	brain	--
it	's	a	lot	 small 	 er 	 	than	a	human	brain	.
so	when	show	my	 friend 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	they	've	told	me	,	``	you	know	,	sebastian	,	you	should	just	give	up	.
 neuro 	 science 	 	is	 hope 	 less 	 	.	``
 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	look	at	a	brain	with	your	naked	eye	,	you	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	see	how	complex	it	is	,	but	when	you	use	a	 micro 	 scope 	 	,	 final 	 ly 	 	the	 hid 	 den 	 	 complex 	 ity 	 	is	 reveal 	 ed 	 	.
in	the	17th	century	,	the	 mathematic 	 ian 	 	and	 philosoph 	 er 	 	,	blaise	pascal	,	wrote	of	his	dread	of	the	infinite	,	his	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	 in 	 sign 	 ific 	 ance 	 	at	 contempl 	 ating 	 	the	vast	 reach 	 es 	 	of	 out 	 er 	 	space	.
and	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	scientist	,	i	'm	not	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	talk	about	my	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	--
too	much	information	,	professor	.
but	may	i	?
i	feel	curiosity	,	and	i	feel	wonder	,	but	at	 time 	 s 	 	i	have	 al 	 so 	 	felt	despair	.
why	did	i	 choos 	 e 	 	to	 stud 	 y 	 	 th 	 is 	 	organ	that	is	so	awesome	in	 it 	 s 	 	 complex 	 ity 	 	that	it	might	well	be	infinite	?
it	's	absurd	.
how	could	we	even	 da 	 re 	 	to	think	that	we	might	ever	understand	 th 	 is 	 	?
and	yet	,	i	persist	in	 th 	 is 	 	 qui 	 x 	 otic 	 	endeavor	.
and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	these	 day 	 s 	 	i	harbor	new	 hope 	 s 	 	.
 some 	 day 	 	,	a	fleet	of	 micro 	 scope 	 s 	 	will	capture	every	 neuro 	 n 	 	and	every	synapse	in	a	vast	 data 	 base 	 	of	 image 	 s 	 	.
and	some	day	,	 artificial 	 ly 	 	intelligent	 super 	 computer 	 s 	 	will	 analyz 	 e 	 	the	 image 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	human	 assist 	 ance 	 	to	summarize	them	in	a	 connect 	 ome 	 	.
i	do	not	know	,	but	i	hope	that	i	will	live	to	see	that	day	,
 be 	 cause 	 	 find 	 ing 	 	an	entire	human	 connect 	 ome 	 	is	one	of	the	 great 	 est 	 	 techno 	 logical 	 	 challeng 	 es 	 	of	all	time	.
it	will	take	the	work	of	 generation 	 s 	 	to	succeed	.
at	the	present	time	,	my	 collabor 	 ators 	 	and	i	,	what	we	're	 aim 	 ing 	 	for	is	much	more	modest	--	just	to	find	partial	 connect 	 ome 	 s 	 	of	 tin 	 y 	 	 chunk 	 s 	 	of	mouse	and	human	brain	.
but	even	that	will	be	 en 	 ough 	 	for	the	first	 test 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 hypo 	 thesis 	 	that	i	am	my	 connect 	 ome 	 	.
for	now	,	let	me	try	to	 con 	 vince 	 	you	of	the	 pla 	 us 	 ibility 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 hypo 	 thesis 	 	,	that	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	worth	taking	 serious 	 ly 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	grow	 dur 	 ing 	 	 child 	 hood 	 	and	age	 dur 	 ing 	 	 adult 	 hood 	 	,	your	personal	 ident 	 ity 	 	 change 	 s 	 	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	.
 like 	 wise 	 	,	every	 connect 	 ome 	 	 change 	 s 	 	over	time	.
what	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 change 	 s 	 	happen	?
well	,	 neuro 	 ns 	 	,	like	 tree 	 s 	 	,	can	grow	new	 branch 	 es 	 	,	and	they	can	lose	old	 one 	 s 	 	.
 synapse 	 s 	 	can	be	 create 	 d 	 	,	and	they	can	be	 eliminate 	 d 	 	.
and	 synapse 	 s 	 	can	grow	 large 	 r 	 	,	and	they	can	grow	 small 	 er 	 	.
second	question	:	what	 cause 	 s 	 	these	 change 	 s 	 	?
well	,	it	's	true	.
to	some	 ex 	 tent 	 	,	they	are	 programm 	 ed 	 	by	your	 gene 	 s 	 	.
but	that	's	not	the	whole	story	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	are	 signal 	 s 	 	,	 electric 	 al 	 	 signal 	 s 	 	,	that	travel	 a 	 long 	 	the	 branch 	 es 	 	of	 neuro 	 ns 	 	and	chemical	 signal 	 s 	 	that	jump	 a 	 cross 	 	from	branch	to	branch	.
these	 signal 	 s 	 	are	 call 	 ed 	 	neural	activity	.
and	there	's	a	lot	of	evidence	that	neural	activity	is	 en 	 cod 	 ing 	 	our	 thought 	 s 	 	,	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	 per 	 ception 	 s 	 	,	our	mental	 experience 	 s 	 	.
and	there	's	a	lot	of	evidence	that	neural	activity	can	cause	your	 connect 	 ions 	 	to	change	.
and	if	you	put	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 fact 	 s 	 	together	,	it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	your	 experience 	 s 	 	can	change	your	 connect 	 ome 	 	.
and	that	's	why	every	 connect 	 ome 	 	is	 un 	 ique 	 	,	even	 t 	 hose 	 	of	 genetic 	 ally 	 	 ident 	 ical 	 	 t 	 win 	 s 	 	.
the	 connect 	 ome 	 	is	where	nature	 meet 	 s 	 	nurture	.
and	it	might	true	that	just	the	mere	act	of	 think 	 ing 	 	can	change	your	 connect 	 ome 	 	--	an	idea	that	you	may	find	 empower 	 ing 	 	.
what	's	in	 th 	 is 	 	picture	?
a	cool	and	 re 	 fresh 	 ing 	 	stream	of	water	,	you	say	.
what	else	is	in	 th 	 is 	 	picture	?
do	not	forget	that	groove	in	the	earth	 call 	 ed 	 	the	stream	bed	.
 with 	 out 	 	it	,	the	water	would	not	know	in	which	direction	to	flow	.
and	with	the	stream	,	i	would	like	to	 pro 	 pose 	 	a	metaphor	for	the	relationship	between	neural	activity	and	 connect 	 ivity 	 	.
neural	activity	is	 constant 	 ly 	 	changing	.
it	's	like	the	water	of	the	stream	;	it	never	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	still	.
the	 connect 	 ions 	 	of	the	brain	's	neural	network	 determine 	 s 	 	the	 path 	 ways 	 	 a 	 long 	 	which	neural	activity	 flow 	 s 	 	.
and	so	the	 connect 	 ome 	 	is	like	bed	of	the	stream	;
but	the	metaphor	is	 rich 	 er 	 	than	that	,
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	true	that	the	stream	bed	 guide 	 s 	 	the	flow	of	the	water	,	but	over	long	 time 	 scale 	 s 	 	,	the	water	 al 	 so 	 	 re 	 shape 	 s 	 	the	bed	of	the	stream	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	told	you	just	now	,	neural	activity	can	change	the	 connect 	 ome 	 	.
and	if	you	'll	allow	me	to	ascend	to	 metaphor 	 ical 	 	 height 	 s 	 	,	i	will	 re 	 mind 	 	you	that	neural	activity	is	the	physical	 bas 	 is 	 	--	or	so	 neuro 	 scientist 	 s 	 	think	--	of	 thought 	 s 	 	,	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	 per 	 ception 	 s 	 	.
and	so	we	might	even	speak	of	the	stream	of	 conscious 	 ness 	 	.
neural	activity	is	 it 	 s 	 	water	,	and	the	 connect 	 ome 	 	is	 it 	 s 	 	bed	.
so	let	's	return	from	the	 height 	 s 	 	of	metaphor	and	return	to	science	.
suppose	our	 techno 	 logies 	 	for	 find 	 ing 	 	 connect 	 ome 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	work	.
how	will	we	go	about	 test 	 ing 	 	the	 hypo 	 thesis 	 	``	i	am	my	 connect 	 ome 	 	?	``
well	,	i	 pro 	 pose 	 	a	direct	test	.
let	us	attempt	to	read	out	 memor 	 ies 	 	from	 connect 	 ome 	 s 	 	.
consider	the	 memor 	 y 	 	of	long	temporal	 sequence 	 s 	 	of	 move 	 ments 	 	,	like	a	pianist	 play 	 ing 	 	a	beethoven	 son 	 ata 	 	.
 accord 	 ing 	 	to	a	 theor 	 y 	 	that	 date 	 s 	 	back	to	the	19th	century	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 memor 	 ies 	 	are	 store 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 chain 	 s 	 	of	 syn 	 apt 	 ic 	 	 connect 	 ions 	 	 in 	 side 	 	your	brain	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	if	the	first	 neuro 	 ns 	 	in	the	chain	are	 activate 	 d 	 	,	through	 the 	 ir 	 	 synapse 	 s 	 	they	 s 	 end 	 	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	to	the	second	 neuro 	 ns 	 	,	which	are	 activate 	 d 	 	,	and	so	on	down	the	line	,	like	a	chain	of	 fall 	 ing 	 	 domin 	 o 	 es 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	sequence	of	neural	 activ 	 ation 	 	is	 hypothesize 	 d 	 	to	be	the	neural	 bas 	 is 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	sequence	of	 move 	 ments 	 	.
so	one	way	of	 try 	 ing 	 	to	test	the	 theor 	 y 	 	is	to	look	for	 s 	 uch 	 	 chain 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	 connect 	 ome 	 s 	 	.
but	it	wo	n't	be	easy	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	not	going	to	look	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
they	're	going	to	be	 scramble 	 d 	 	up	.
so	we	'll	have	to	use	our	 computer 	 s 	 	to	try	to	 un 	 scramble 	 	the	chain	.
and	if	we	can	do	that	,	the	sequence	of	the	 neuro 	 ns 	 	we	 re 	 cover 	 	from	that	 un 	 s 	 cram 	 bling 	 	will	be	a	 predict 	 ion 	 	of	the	pattern	of	neural	activity	that	is	 re 	 play 	 ed 	 	in	the	brain	 dur 	 ing 	 	 memor 	 y 	 	recall	.
and	if	that	 we 	 re 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	,	that	would	be	the	first	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 read 	 ing 	 	a	 memor 	 y 	 	from	a	 connect 	 ome 	 	.
what	a	mess	--
have	you	ever	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	wire	up	a	system	 a 	 s 	 	complex	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	?
i	hope	not	.
but	if	you	have	,	you	know	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	to	make	a	 mistak 	 e 	 	.
the	 branch 	 es 	 	of	 neuro 	 ns 	 	are	like	the	 wire 	 s 	 	of	the	brain	.
can	 any 	 one 	 	guess	:	what	's	the	total	length	of	 wire 	 s 	 	in	your	brain	?
i	'll	give	you	a	hint	.	it	's	a	big	number	.
i	estimate	,	 million 	 s 	 	of	 mile 	 s 	 	,
all	 pack 	 ed 	 	in	your	skull	.
and	if	you	appreciate	that	number	,	you	can	 eas 	 ily 	 	see	there	is	huge	potential	for	mis	-	wiring	of	the	brain	.
and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	the	popular	press	 love 	 s 	 	 head 	 lines 	 	like	,	``	 ano 	 re 	 xic 	 	 brain 	 s 	 	are	wired	 different 	 ly 	 	,	``	or	``	 aut 	 istic 	 	 brain 	 s 	 	are	wired	 different 	 ly 	 	.	``
these	are	plausible	 claim 	 s 	 	,	but	in	truth	,	we	ca	n't	see	the	brain	's	wiring	 clear 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	to	tell	if	these	are	 re 	 ally 	 	true	.
and	so	the	 techno 	 logies 	 	for	 see 	 ing 	 	 connect 	 ome 	 s 	 	will	allow	us	to	 final 	 ly 	 	read	mis	-	wiring	of	the	brain	,	to	see	mental	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	in	 connect 	 ome 	 s 	 	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	the	best	way	to	test	a	 hypo 	 thesis 	 	is	to	consider	 it 	 s 	 	most	 extrem 	 e 	 	 implic 	 ation 	 	.
 philosoph 	 ers 	 	know	 th 	 is 	 	game	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.
if	you	 believ 	 e 	 	that	i	am	my	 connect 	 ome 	 	,	i	think	you	must	 al 	 so 	 	accept	the	idea	that	death	is	the	 destruct 	 ion 	 	of	your	 connect 	 ome 	 	.
i	 ment 	 ion 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	there	are	 prophet 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	who	claim	that	technology	will	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	alter	the	human	condition	and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	even	transform	the	human	species	.
one	of	 the 	 ir 	 	most	 cher 	 ish 	 ed 	 	 dream 	 s 	 	is	to	cheat	death	by	that	practice	known	 a 	 s 	 	 cryo 	 nic 	 s 	 	.
if	you	pay	100,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	you	can	arrange	to	have	your	body	 froze 	 n 	 	after	death	and	 store 	 d 	 	in	liquid	nitrogen	in	one	of	these	 tank 	 s 	 	in	an	arizona	 ware 	 house 	 	,	 await 	 ing 	 	a	future	 civil 	 ization 	 	that	is	 advance 	 d 	 	to	resurrect	you	.
should	we	 ridicul 	 e 	 	the	modern	 seek 	 ers 	 	of	 im 	 mortal 	 ity 	 	,	 call 	 ing 	 	them	 fool 	 s 	 	?
or	will	they	 some 	 day 	 	 chuck 	 le 	 	over	our	 grave 	 s 	 	?
i	do	n't	know	--
i	prefer	to	test	 the 	 ir 	 	 belief 	 s 	 	,	 scientific 	 ally 	 	.
i	 pro 	 pose 	 	that	we	attempt	to	find	a	 connect 	 ome 	 	of	a	 froze 	 n 	 	brain	.
we	know	that	damage	to	the	brain	 occur 	 s 	 	after	death	and	 dur 	 ing 	 	freezing	.
the	question	is	:	 ha 	 s 	 	that	damage	 era 	 s 	 ed 	 	the	 connect 	 ome 	 	?
if	it	 ha 	 s 	 	,	there	is	no	way	that	any	future	 civil 	 ization 	 	will	be	able	to	 re 	 cover 	 	the	 memor 	 ies 	 	of	these	 froze 	 n 	 	 brain 	 s 	 	.
 resurrect 	 ion 	 	might	succeed	for	the	body	,	but	not	for	the	mind	.
on	the	other	hand	,	if	the	 connect 	 ome 	 	is	still	 in 	 tact 	 	,	we	can	not	 ridicul 	 e 	 	the	 claim 	 s 	 	of	 cryo 	 nic 	 s 	 	so	 eas 	 ily 	 	.
i	've	 de 	 scribed 	 	a	quest	that	 begin 	 s 	 	in	the	world	of	the	 ver 	 y 	 	small	,	and	 propel 	 s 	 	us	to	the	world	of	the	far	future	.
 connect 	 ome 	 s 	 	will	mark	a	 turn 	 ing 	 	point	in	human	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	we	 evolv 	 ed 	 	from	our	ape	-	like	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	on	the	african	savanna	,	what	 distinguish 	 ed 	 	us	was	our	 large 	 r 	 	 brain 	 s 	 	.
we	have	used	our	 brain 	 s 	 	to	fashion	ever	more	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	.
 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	these	 techno 	 logies 	 	will	 be 	 come 	 	so	 power 	 ful 	 	that	we	will	use	them	to	know	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	by	 de 	 construct 	 ing 	 	and	 re 	 construct 	 ing 	 	our	own	 brain 	 s 	 	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	voyage	of	self	-	 discover 	 y 	 	is	not	just	for	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	but	for	all	of	us	.
and	i	'm	 grat 	 e 	 ful 	 	for	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	share	 th 	 is 	 	voyage	with	you	 to 	 day 	 	.
thank	you	.
