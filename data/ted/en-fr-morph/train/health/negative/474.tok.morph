back	in	1992	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	for	a	company	 call 	 ed 	 	 inter 	 val 	 	research	,	which	was	just	then	 be 	 ing 	 	 found 	 ed 	 	by	david	lidell	and	paul	allen	 a 	 s 	 	a	for	-	profit	research	enterprise	in	silicon	 val 	 ley 	 	.
i	met	with	david	to	talk	about	what	i	might	do	in	his	company	.
i	was	just	coming	out	of	a	 fail 	 ed 	 	virtual	 re 	 ality 	 	business	and	 support 	 ing 	 	 my 	 self 	 	by	 be 	 ing 	 	on	the	 s 	 peaking 	 	circuit	and	writing	 book 	 s 	 	--	after	twenty	 year 	 s 	 	or	so	in	the	computer	game	industry	 hav 	 ing 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	that	people	did	n't	think	they	could	sell	.
and	david	and	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	we	had	a	question	in	common	,	that	we	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	the	answer	to	,	and	that	was	,	``	why	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 any 	 body 	 	built	any	computer	 game 	 s 	 	for	little	 girl 	 s 	 	?	``
why	is	that	?
it	ca	n't	just	be	a	giant	 s 	 exist 	 	 conspi 	 racy 	 	.
these	people	are	n't	that	smart	.
there	's	six	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	on	the	table	.
they	would	go	for	it	if	they	could	figure	out	how	.
so	,	what	is	the	deal	here	?
and	 a 	 s 	 	we	thought	about	our	 goal 	 s 	 	--	i	should	say	that	 inter 	 val 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	a	 human 	 istic 	 	institution	,	in	the	 classic 	 al 	 	sense	that	 human 	 ism 	 	,	at	 it 	 s 	 	best	,	 find 	 s 	 	a	way	to	combine	clear	-	eyed	 empir 	 ical 	 	research	with	a	set	of	core	 value 	 s 	 	that	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	love	and	respect	people	.
the	 bas 	 ic 	 	idea	of	 human 	 ism 	 	is	the	 improv 	 able 	 	quality	of	life	;	that	we	can	do	good	 thing 	 s 	 	,	that	there	are	 thing 	 s 	 	worth	 do 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	good	 thing 	 s 	 	to	do	,	and	that	clear	-	eyed	 empir 	 ic 	 ism 	 	can	help	us	figure	out	how	to	do	them	.
so	,	 contr 	 ary 	 	to	popular	belief	,	there	is	not	a	conflict	of	interest	between	 empir 	 ic 	 ism 	 	and	 value 	 s 	 	.
and	 inter 	 val 	 	research	is	kind	of	the	living	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	how	that	can	be	true	.
so	david	and	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	go	find	out	,	through	the	best	research	we	could	 must 	 er 	 	,	what	it	would	take	to	get	a	little	girl	to	put	her	 hand 	 s 	 	on	a	computer	,	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	the	level	of	comfort	and	ease	with	the	technology	that	little	 boy 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 cause 	 	they	play	video	 game 	 s 	 	.
we	 s 	 pent 	 	two	and	a	half	 year 	 s 	 	 conduct 	 ing 	 	research	;	we	 s 	 pent 	 	 an 	 other 	 	year	and	a	half	in	advance	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
then	we	 form 	 ed 	 	a	spin	-	off	company	.
in	the	research	phase	of	the	project	at	 inter 	 val 	 	,	we	 partner 	 ed 	 	with	a	company	 call 	 ed 	 	cheskin	research	,	and	these	people	--	davis	masten	and	christopher	ireland	--	 change 	 d 	 	my	mind	 entire 	 ly 	 	about	what	market	research	was	and	what	it	could	be	.
they	taught	me	how	to	look	and	see	,	and	they	did	not	do	the	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	stupid	thing	of	 say 	 ing 	 	to	a	child	,	``	of	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	we	 al 	 ready 	 	make	you	,	which	do	you	like	best	?	``	--	which	 give 	 s 	 	you	zero	 answer 	 s 	 	that	are	 us 	 able 	 	.
so	,	what	we	did	for	the	first	two	and	a	half	 year 	 s 	 	was	four	 thing 	 s 	 	:	we	did	an	 extens 	 ive 	 	review	of	the	 liter 	 ature 	 	in	related	 field 	 s 	 	,	like	cognitive	 psycho 	 logy 	 	,	spatial	cognition	,	gender	 stud 	 ies 	 	,	play	 theor 	 y 	 	,	 socio 	 logy 	 	,	 prim 	 at 	 ology 	 	.	thank	you	frans	de	waal	,	 where 	 ver 	 	you	are	,	i	love	you	and	i	'd	give	 any 	 thing 	 	to	meet	you	.
after	we	had	 d 	 one 	 	that	with	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	large	team	of	people	and	 discover 	 ed 	 	what	we	thought	the	 s 	 al 	 ient 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	with	 girl 	 s 	 	and	 boy 	 s 	 	and	 play 	 ing 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	,	after	all	,	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	what	 th 	 is 	 	is	about	--	we	 move 	 d 	 	to	the	second	phase	of	our	work	,	where	we	 interview 	 ed 	 	adult	 expert 	 s 	 	in	academia	,	some	of	the	people	who	'd	 produce 	 d 	 	the	 liter 	 ature 	 	that	we	found	relevant	.	 al 	 so 	 	,	we	did	focus	 group 	 s 	 	with	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	on	the	ground	with	 kid 	 s 	 	every	day	,	like	 play 	 ground 	 	 super 	 visor 	 s 	 	.	we	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	them	,	 confirm 	 ed 	 	some	 hypo 	 these 	 s 	 	and	identified	some	serious	 question 	 s 	 	about	gender	 differ 	 ence 	 	and	play	.
then	we	did	what	i	consider	to	be	the	heart	of	the	work	:	 interview 	 ed 	 	1,100	children	,	 boy 	 s 	 	and	 girl 	 s 	 	,	 age 	 s 	 	seven	to	12	,	all	over	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	--	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	silicon	 val 	 ley 	 	,	boston	and	austin	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 k 	 new 	 	that	 the 	 ir 	 	little	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	would	have	 million 	 s 	 	of	 computer 	 s 	 	in	them	and	they	would	n't	be	a	 represent 	 ative 	 	 s 	 ample 	 	.
and	at	the	end	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	 conversation 	 s 	 	with	 kid 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	best	 friend 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	after	two	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	 pull 	 ed 	 	together	some	survey	data	from	 an 	 other 	 	10,000	children	,	drew	up	a	set	up	of	what	we	thought	 we 	 re 	 	the	key	 find 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	our	research	,	and	 s 	 pent 	 	 an 	 other 	 	year	 transform 	 ing 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	design	 heuristic 	 s 	 	,	for	 design 	 ing 	 	computer	-	based	 product 	 s 	 	--	and	,	in	fact	,	any	kind	of	 product 	 s 	 	--	for	little	 girl 	 s 	 	,	 age 	 s 	 	eight	to	12	.
and	we	 s 	 pent 	 	that	time	 design 	 ing 	 	 inter 	 active 	 	 prototype 	 s 	 	for	computer	 soft 	 ware 	 	and	 test 	 ing 	 	them	with	little	 girl 	 s 	 	.
in	1996	,	in	november	,	we	 form 	 ed 	 	the	company	 pur 	 ple 	 	moon	which	was	a	 spin 	 off 	 	of	 inter 	 val 	 	research	,	and	our	chief	 invest 	 ors 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 inter 	 val 	 	research	,	vulcan	 north 	 west 	 	,	 institution 	 al 	 	venture	 partner 	 s 	 	and	allen	and	company	.
we	 launch 	 ed 	 	a	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	on	september	2nd	that	 ha 	 s 	 	now	 serv 	 ed 	 	25	million	 page 	 s 	 	,	and	 ha 	 s 	 	42,000	 register 	 ed 	 	young	girl	 user 	 s 	 	.	they	visit	an	average	of	one	and	a	half	 time 	 s 	 	a	day	,	 s 	 pend 	 	an	average	of	35	 minute 	 s 	 	a	visit	,	and	look	at	50	 page 	 s 	 	a	visit	.
so	we	feel	that	we	've	 form 	 ed 	 	a	 success 	 ful 	 	 on 	 line 	 	community	with	 girl 	 s 	 	.
we	 launch 	 ed 	 	two	 title 	 s 	 	in	october	--	``	rockett	's	new	school	``	--	the	first	of	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 product 	 s 	 	--	is	about	a	character	 call 	 ed 	 	rockett	 begin 	 ning 	 	her	first	day	of	school	in	eighth	grade	at	a	brand	new	place	,	with	a	blank	 s 	 late 	 	,	which	 allow 	 s 	 	 girl 	 s 	 	to	play	with	the	question	of	,	``	what	will	i	be	like	when	i	'm	 old 	 er 	 	?	``
``	what	's	it	going	to	be	like	to	be	in	high	school	or	 juni 	 or 	 	high	school	?
who	are	my	 friend 	 s 	 	?	``	;
to	 exercis 	 e 	 	the	love	of	social	 complex 	 ity 	 	and	the	narrative	 intellig 	 ence 	 	that	 drive 	 s 	 	most	of	 the 	 ir 	 	play	behavior	;	and	which	 embed 	 s 	 	in	it	 value 	 s 	 	about	 not 	 ic 	 ing 	 	that	we	have	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 choice 	 s 	 	in	our	 live 	 s 	 	and	the	ways	that	we	conduct	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
the	other	title	that	we	 launch 	 ed 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	secret	 path 	 s 	 	in	the	forest	,	``	which	 address 	 es 	 	the	more	 fanta 	 s 	 y 	 	-	oriented	,	inner	 live 	 s 	 	of	 girl 	 s 	 	.
these	two	 title 	 s 	 	both	 show 	 ed 	 	up	in	the	top	50	 entertain 	 ment 	 	 title 	 s 	 	in	pc	data	--	 entertain 	 ment 	 	 title 	 s 	 	in	pc	data	in	december	,	right	up	there	with	``	john	madden	 foot 	 ball 	 	,	``	which	 thrill 	 s 	 	me	to	death	.
so	,	we	're	real	,	and	we	've	 touch 	 ed 	 	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	little	 girl 	 s 	 	.
we	've	made	half	-	a	-	billion	 impression 	 s 	 	with	 market 	 ing 	 	and	pr	for	 th 	 is 	 	brand	,	 pur 	 ple 	 	moon	.
ninety	-	six	percent	of	them	,	 rough 	 ly 	 	,	have	 be 	 en 	 	positive	;	four	percent	of	them	have	 be 	 en 	 	``	other	.	``
i	want	to	talk	about	the	other	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 politic 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	enterprise	,	in	a	way	,	have	 be 	 en 	 	the	most	 fasci 	 nating 	 	part	of	it	,	for	me	.
there	are	 re 	 ally 	 	two	 kind 	 s 	 	of	negative	 review 	 s 	 	that	we	've	 receiv 	 ed 	 	.
one	kind	of	 review 	 er 	 	is	a	male	 gam 	 er 	 	who	 think 	 s 	 	he	 know 	 s 	 	what	 game 	 s 	 	ought	to	be	,	and	wo	n't	show	the	product	to	little	 girl 	 s 	 	.
the	other	kind	of	 review 	 er 	 	is	a	certain	flavor	of	feminist	who	 think 	 s 	 	they	know	what	little	 girl 	 s 	 	ought	to	be	.
and	so	it	's	funny	to	me	that	these	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	odd	 bed 	 fellow 	 s 	 	have	one	thing	in	common	:	they	do	n't	listen	to	little	 girl 	 s 	 	.
they	have	n't	 look 	 ed 	 	at	children	and	they	're	 certain 	 ly 	 	not	 demonst 	 rating 	 	any	love	for	them	.
i	'd	like	to	play	you	some	 voice 	 s 	 	of	little	 girl 	 s 	 	from	the	two	-	and	-	a	-	half	 year 	 s 	 	of	research	that	we	did	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	some	of	the	 voice 	 s 	 	are	more	 re 	 cent 	 	.
and	these	 voice 	 s 	 	will	be	 accompani 	 ed 	 	by	 photograph 	 s 	 	that	they	took	for	us	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	,	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	they	value	and	care	about	.
these	are	 picture 	 s 	 	the	 girl 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	never	saw	,	but	they	 g 	 ave 	 	to	us	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	stuff	 t 	 hose 	 	 review 	 ers 	 	do	n't	know	about	and	are	n't	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	kind	of	research	i	recommend	to	 t 	 hose 	 	who	want	to	do	 human 	 istic 	 	work	.
girl	1	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	my	character	is	 usual 	 ly 	 	a	tomboy	.	 her 	 s 	 	is	more	 in 	 to 	 	 boy 	 s 	 	.

if	at	any	time	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	game	we	want	to	learn	more	about	the	 character 	 s 	 	,	we	can	go	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 hid 	 den 	 	 hall 	 way 	 	,	and	i	'll	 quick 	 ly 	 	just	show	you	the	 inter 	 face 	 	.
