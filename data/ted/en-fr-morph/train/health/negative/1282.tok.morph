 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	gather	around	.
i	would	love	to	share	with	you	a	story	.
once	 up 	 on 	 	a	time	in	19th	century	germany	,	there	was	the	book	.
now	 dur 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	time	,	the	book	was	the	king	of	 story 	 tell 	 ing 	 	.
it	was	 vene 	 r 	 able 	 	.
it	was	 ubiqu 	 it 	 ous 	 	.
but	it	was	a	little	bit	 bor 	 ing 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	400	 year 	 s 	 	of	 exist 	 ence 	 	,	 story 	 teller 	 s 	 	never	 evolv 	 ed 	 	the	book	 a 	 s 	 	a	 story 	 tell 	 ing 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	.
but	then	one	author	 arriv 	 ed 	 	,	and	he	 change 	 d 	 	the	game	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
his	name	was	lothar	,	lothar	meggendorfer	.
lothar	meggendorfer	put	his	foot	down	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 gen 	 ug 	 	ist	 gen 	 ug 	 	!	``
he	 grab 	 bed 	 	his	pen	,	he	 snatch 	 ed 	 	his	 s 	 cis 	 s 	 ors 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	man	 re 	 fused 	 	to	fold	to	the	 convention 	 s 	 	of	 normal 	 cy 	 	and	just	 decide 	 d 	 	to	fold	.
 histo 	 ry 	 	would	know	lothar	meggendorfer	 a 	 s 	 	--	who	else	?	--	the	world	's	first	true	inventor	of	the	children	's	pop	-	up	book	.
for	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 light 	 	and	for	 th 	 is 	 	wonder	,	people	 re 	 jo 	 ic 	 ed 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	happy	 be 	 cause 	 	the	story	 surviv 	 ed 	 	,	and	that	the	world	would	keep	on	 s 	 pinning 	 	.
lothar	meggendorfer	was	n't	the	first	to	evolve	the	way	a	story	was	told	,	and	he	 certain 	 ly 	 	was	n't	the	last	.
 whet 	 her 	 	 story 	 teller 	 s 	 	 real 	 ized 	 	it	or	not	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 channel 	 ing 	 	meggendorfer	's	spirit	when	they	 move 	 d 	 	opera	to	 va 	 ud 	 ville 	 	,	radio	news	to	radio	theater	,	film	to	film	in	motion	to	film	in	sound	,	color	,	3d	,	on	vhs	and	on	dvd	.
there	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	be	no	cure	for	 th 	 is 	 	meggendorferitis	.	and	 thing 	 s 	 	got	a	lot	more	 f 	 un 	 	when	the	 inter 	 net 	 	came	around	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	could	people	 broad 	 cast 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	world	,	but	they	could	do	so	using	what	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	be	an	infinite	amount	of	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	one	company	would	tell	a	story	of	love	through	 it 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	own	search	engine	.
one	taiwanese	production	studio	would	interpret	american	 politic 	 s 	 	in	3d	.
and	one	man	would	tell	the	 st 	 ories 	 	of	his	father	by	using	a	platform	 call 	 ed 	 	twitter	to	communicate	the	 ex 	 cre 	 ment 	 	his	father	would	 gesticul 	 ate 	 	.
and	after	all	 th 	 is 	 	,	 every 	 one 	 	 pause 	 d 	 	;	they	took	a	step	back	.
they	 real 	 ized 	 	that	,	in	6,000	 year 	 s 	 	of	 story 	 tell 	 ing 	 	,	they	've	gone	from	 depict 	 ing 	 	 hunt 	 ing 	 	on	cave	 wall 	 s 	 	to	 depict 	 ing 	 	shakespeare	on	facebook	 wall 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	cause	for	 celebr 	 ation 	 	.
the	art	of	 story 	 tell 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 remain 	 ed 	 	 un 	 change 	 d 	 	.
and	for	the	most	part	,	the	 st 	 ories 	 	are	 recycl 	 ed 	 	.
but	the	way	that	 human 	 s 	 	tell	the	 st 	 ories 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	with	 pur 	 e 	 	,	 consist 	 ent 	 	 novel 	 ty 	 	.
and	they	 remember 	 ed 	 	a	man	,	one	 amaz 	 ing 	 	german	,	every	time	a	new	 story 	 tell 	 ing 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	 pop 	 ped 	 	up	next	.
