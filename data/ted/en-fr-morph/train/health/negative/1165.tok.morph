in	2007	,	i	 decide 	 d 	 	that	we	 need 	 ed 	 	to	 re 	 conceptual 	 ize 	 	how	we	thought	about	economic	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
our	new	goal	should	be	that	when	every	family	 think 	 s 	 	about	where	they	want	to	live	and	work	,	they	should	be	able	to	 choos 	 e 	 	between	at	 l 	 east 	 	a	 hand 	 ful 	 	of	different	cities	that	 we 	 re 	 	all	 com 	 pet 	 ing 	 	to	attract	new	 resident 	 s 	 	.
now	we	're	a	long	way	away	from	that	goal	right	now	.
there	are	 billion 	 s 	 	of	people	in	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	who	do	n't	have	even	a	single	city	that	would	be	 will 	 ing 	 	to	welcome	them	.
but	the	 amaz 	 ing 	 	thing	about	cities	is	they	're	worth	so	much	more	than	it	 cost 	 s 	 	to	build	them	.
so	we	could	 eas 	 ily 	 	supply	the	world	with	 dozen 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	,	of	new	cities	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	might	sound	preposterous	to	you	if	you	've	never	thought	about	new	cities	.
but	just	 substitut 	 e 	 	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	building	for	cities	.
imagine	half	the	people	who	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	in	 a 	 part 	 ments 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	had	them	;	the	other	half	are	n't	there	yet	.
you	could	try	and	expand	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	by	 do 	 ing 	 	additions	on	all	the	 exist 	 ing 	 	 a 	 part 	 ments 	 	.
but	you	know	what	you	'd	run	 in 	 to 	 	is	 t 	 hose 	 	 a 	 part 	 ments 	 	and	the	 surround 	 ing 	 	 area 	 s 	 	have	 rule 	 s 	 	to	avoid	 dis 	 comfort 	 	and	the	 distract 	 ions 	 	of	construction	.
so	it	's	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	hard	to	do	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	additions	.
but	you	could	go	out	 some 	 place 	 	brand	new	,	build	a	brand	new	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	building	,	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	the	 rule 	 s 	 	there	 we 	 re 	 	 one 	 s 	 	that	 facilitate 	 d 	 	construction	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 get 	 ting 	 	in	the	way	.
so	i	 pro 	 posed 	 	that	 government 	 s 	 	create	new	reform	 zone 	 s 	 	big	 en 	 ough 	 	to	hold	cities	and	 g 	 ave 	 	them	a	name	:	 chart 	 er 	 	cities	.
 lat 	 er 	 	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	at	about	 th 	 is 	 	same	time	,	javier	and	octavio	 we 	 re 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	of	reform	in	honduras	.
they	 k 	 new 	 	that	about	75,000	hondurans	every	year	would	 leav 	 e 	 	to	go	to	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	ask	,	what	could	they	do	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	 t 	 hose 	 	people	could	stay	and	do	the	same	 thing 	 s 	 	in	honduras	.
at	one	point	,	javier	 s 	 aid 	 	to	octavio	,	``	what	if	we	took	some	of	our	empty	land	--	what	if	we	just	 g 	 ave 	 	it	to	an	 emb 	 ass 	 y 	 	--	give	some	to	the	u.s.	 emb 	 ass 	 y 	 	;	give	some	to	the	canadian	 emb 	 ass 	 y 	 	--	and	then	if	people	want	to	go	work	under	the	 rule 	 s 	 	of	canada	or	under	the	 rule 	 s 	 	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	they	can	go	get	 job 	 s 	 	,	do	 every 	 thing 	 	they	do	on	 t 	 hose 	 	 emb 	 ass 	 y 	 	 ground 	 s 	 	that	they	would	 other 	 wise 	 	have	to	go	to	canada	or	the	u.s.	to	do	?	``	in	the	summer	of	2009	,	honduras	went	through	a	 wrench 	 ing 	 	 constit 	 ution 	 al 	 	crisis	.
at	the	next	 regular 	 ly 	 	 schedule 	 d 	 	election	,	pepe	lobo	won	in	a	 land 	 slide 	 	on	a	platform	that	 promise 	 d 	 	reform	,	but	 reconcili 	 ation 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
he	 ask 	 ed 	 	octavio	to	be	his	chief	of	staff	.
 mean 	 while 	 	,	i	was	 get 	 ting 	 	ready	to	give	a	talk	at	tedglobal	.
through	a	process	of	 refine 	 ment 	 	,	trial	and	error	,	a	lot	of	user	 test 	 ing 	 	,	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	boil	 th 	 is 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	 con 	 cept 	 	of	 chart 	 er 	 	city	down	to	the	bare	 essential 	 s 	 	.
the	first	point	was	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	 rule 	 s 	 	,	like	 t 	 hose 	 	 rule 	 s 	 	that	say	you	ca	n't	come	in	and	disturb	all	the	 exist 	 ing 	 	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	 holder 	 s 	 	.
we	pay	a	lot	of	attention	to	new	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	but	it	 take 	 s 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	and	 rule 	 s 	 	to	get	progress	,
and	it	's	 usual 	 ly 	 	the	 rule 	 s 	 	that	hold	us	back	.
in	the	fall	of	2010	,	a	friend	from	guatemala	 s 	 ent 	 	octavio	a	link	to	the	tedtalk	.
he	 show 	 ed 	 	it	to	javier	.
they	 call 	 ed 	 	me	.
they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	let	's	present	 th 	 is 	 	to	the	 lead 	 ers 	 	of	our	country	.	``
so	in	december	we	met	in	miami	,	in	a	hotel	 con 	 ference 	 	room	.
i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	explain	 th 	 is 	 	point	about	how	 valu 	 able 	 	cities	are	,	how	much	more	 valu 	 able 	 	they	are	than	they	cost	.
and	i	used	 th 	 is 	 	slide	 show 	 ing 	 	how	 valu 	 able 	 	the	raw	land	is	in	a	place	like	new	york	city	:
notice	,	land	that	's	worth	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	in	some	 case 	 s 	 	,	per	square	meter	.
but	it	was	a	 fair 	 ly 	 	abstract	 discuss 	 ion 	 	,	and	at	some	point	when	there	was	a	pause	,	octavio	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	paul	,	 may 	 be 	 	we	could	watch	the	tedtalk	.	``
so	the	tedtalk	laid	out	in	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 term 	 s 	 	,	a	 chart 	 er 	 	city	is	a	place	where	you	start	with	 un 	 inhabit 	 ed 	 	land	,	a	 chart 	 er 	 	that	 spec 	 ifies 	 	the	 rule 	 s 	 	that	will	 app 	 ly 	 	there	and	then	a	chance	for	people	to	opt	in	,	to	go	live	under	 t 	 hose 	 	 rule 	 s 	 	or	not	.
so	i	was	 ask 	 ed 	 	by	the	 p 	 resident 	 	of	honduras	who	 s 	 aid 	 	that	we	need	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	project	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 import 	 ant 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	could	be	the	way	forward	for	our	country	.
i	was	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	come	to	_UNK_	and	talk	 aga 	 in 	 	on	january	fourth	and	fifth	.
so	i	 present 	 ed 	 	 an 	 other 	 	fact	-	 fill 	 ed 	 	 lectur 	 e 	 	that	 include 	 d 	 	a	slide	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	which	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	make	the	point	that	,	if	you	want	to	create	a	lot	of	value	in	a	city	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	big	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	of	denver	,	and	the	 out 	 line 	 	is	the	new	 air 	 port 	 	that	was	built	in	denver	.
 th 	 is 	 	 air 	 port 	 	 al 	 one 	 	 cover 	 s 	 	more	than	100	square	 kilometer 	 s 	 	.
so	i	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 persuad 	 e 	 	the	hondurans	,	if	you	build	a	new	city	,	you	've	got	to	start	with	a	 s 	 ite 	 	that	's	at	 l 	 east 	 	1,000	square	 kilometer 	 s 	 	.
that	's	more	than	250	hundred	-	thousand	 acre 	 s 	 	.
 every 	 body 	 	 applaud 	 ed 	 	 polite 	 ly 	 	.
the	 face 	 s 	 	in	the	audience	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	serious	and	attentive	.
the	 lead 	 er 	 	of	the	congress	came	up	on	stage	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	professor	romer	,	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	for	your	 lectur 	 e 	 	,	but	 may 	 be 	 	we	could	watch	the	tedtalk	.
i	've	got	it	here	on	my	 lap 	 top 	 	.	``	so	i	 s 	 at 	 	down	,	and	they	 play 	 ed 	 	the	tedtalk	.
and	it	got	to	the	 es 	 s 	 ence 	 	,	which	is	that	a	new	city	could	 off 	 er 	 	new	 choice 	 s 	 	for	people	.
there	would	be	a	choice	of	a	city	which	you	could	go	to	which	could	be	in	honduras	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 mile 	 s 	 	away	in	the	north	.
and	it	 al 	 so 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	new	 choice 	 s 	 	for	 lead 	 ers 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	 lead 	 ers 	 	in	the	government	there	in	honduras	would	need	help	from	partner	 count 	 ries 	 	,	who	could	benefit	from	partner	 count 	 ries 	 	who	help	them	set	up	the	 rule 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 chart 	 er 	 	and	the	 enforce 	 ment 	 	,	so	 every 	 body 	 	can	trust	that	the	 chart 	 er 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	will	be	 enforce 	 d 	 	.
and	the	 in 	 sight 	 	of	 p 	 resident 	 	lobo	was	that	that	assurance	of	 enforce 	 ment 	 	that	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 a 	 s 	 	a	way	to	get	the	foreign	 invest 	 ors 	 	to	come	in	and	build	the	city	could	be	 equal 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	for	all	the	different	 part 	 ies 	 	in	honduras	who	had	 suffer 	 ed 	 	for	so	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	from	fear	and	 dis 	 trust 	 	.
we	went	and	 look 	 ed 	 	at	a	 s 	 ite 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	picture	's	from	there	.
it	 eas 	 ily 	 	could	hold	a	thousand	square	 kilometer 	 s 	 	.
and	 short 	 ly 	 	 there 	 after 	 	,	on	january	19th	,	they	 vot 	 ed 	 	in	the	congress	to	amend	 the 	 ir 	 	 constit 	 ution 	 	to	have	a	 constit 	 ution 	 al 	 	 pro 	 vision 	 	that	 allow 	 s 	 	for	special	 develop 	 ment 	 	 region 	 s 	 	.
in	a	country	which	had	just	gone	through	 th 	 is 	 	 wrench 	 ing 	 	crisis	,	the	vote	in	the	congress	in	favor	of	 th 	 is 	 	 constit 	 ution 	 al 	 	amendment	was	124	to	one	.
all	 part 	 ies 	 	,	all	 fact 	 ions 	 	in	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	 back 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
to	be	part	of	the	 constit 	 ution 	 	,	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	to	pass	it	twice	in	the	congress	.
on	february	17th	they	 pass 	 ed 	 	it	 aga 	 in 	 	with	 an 	 other 	 	vote	of	114	to	one	.
 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	after	that	vote	,	on	february	21st	to	the	24th	,	a	 deleg 	 ation 	 	of	about	30	hondurans	went	to	the	two	 place 	 s 	 	in	the	world	that	are	most	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 get 	 ting 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	city	building	business	.
one	is	south	korea	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	of	a	big	,	new	city	center	that	's	 be 	 ing 	 	built	in	south	korea	--	 big 	 ger 	 	than	 down 	 town 	 	boston	.
 every 	 thing 	 	you	see	there	was	built	in	four	 year 	 s 	 	,	after	they	 s 	 pent 	 	four	 year 	 s 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	the	 permit 	 s 	 	.
the	other	place	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	city	building	is	singapore	.
they	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	built	two	cities	 al 	 ready 	 	in	 chin 	 a 	 	and	are	 pre 	 par 	 ing 	 	the	third	.
so	if	you	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	 practical 	 ly 	 	,	here	's	where	we	are	.
they	've	got	a	 s 	 ite 	 	;	they	're	 al 	 ready 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	for	the	second	city	.
they	're	 put 	 ting 	 	in	place	a	legal	system	that	could	allow	for	 manage 	 rs 	 	to	come	in	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	an	external	legal	system	.
one	country	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	 volunteer 	 ed 	 	to	let	 it 	 s 	 	 suprem 	 e 	 	court	be	the	court	of	final	appeal	for	the	new	 judi 	 cial 	 	system	there	.
there	's	 design 	 ers 	 	and	 build 	 ers 	 	of	cities	who	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	.
they	even	can	 br 	 ing 	 	with	them	some	 fin 	 anc 	 ing 	 	.
but	the	one	thing	you	know	they	've	 al 	 ready 	 	 solve 	 d 	 	is	that	there	's	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 ten 	 ants 	 	.
there	's	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 business 	 es 	 	that	would	like	to	locate	in	the	americas	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	in	a	place	with	a	free	trade	zone	,	and	there	's	 lot 	 s 	 	of	people	who	'd	like	to	go	there	.
around	the	world	,	there	's	700	million	people	who	say	they	'd	like	to	move	 permanent 	 ly 	 	 some 	 place 	 	else	right	now	.
there	's	a	million	a	year	who	 leav 	 e 	 	latin	america	to	go	to	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
 man 	 y 	 	of	these	are	a	father	who	 ha 	 s 	 	to	 leav 	 e 	 	his	family	 be 	 hind 	 	to	go	get	a	job	--	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	a	single	mother	who	 ha 	 s 	 	to	get	 en 	 ough 	 	money	to	even	pay	for	food	or	 cloth 	 ing 	 	.
 s 	 ad 	 ly 	 	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	there	are	even	children	who	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	 re 	 unit 	 ed 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	that	they	have	n't	 s 	 een 	 	,	in	some	 case 	 s 	 	,	for	a	decade	.
so	what	kind	of	an	idea	is	it	to	think	about	building	a	brand	new	city	in	honduras	?
or	to	build	a	dozen	of	these	,	or	a	hundred	of	these	,	around	the	world	?
what	kind	of	an	idea	is	it	to	think	about	 insist 	 ing 	 	that	every	family	have	a	choice	of	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	cities	that	are	 com 	 pet 	 ing 	 	to	attract	new	 resident 	 s 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	idea	worth	 spread 	 ing 	 	.
and	my	 friend 	 s 	 	from	honduras	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	to	say	thank	you	,	ted	.
