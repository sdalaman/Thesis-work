the	 ocean 	 s 	 	cover	some	70	percent	of	our	planet	.
and	i	think	arthur	c.	clarke	 prob 	 ably 	 	had	it	right	when	he	 s 	 aid 	 	that	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	we	ought	to	call	our	planet	planet	ocean	.
and	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	are	 huge 	 ly 	 	productive	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	by	the	satellite	image	of	 photo 	 synthesis 	 	,	the	production	of	new	life	.
in	fact	,	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	produce	half	of	the	new	life	every	day	on	earth	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	about	half	the	oxygen	that	we	breathe	.
in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	that	,	it	 harbor 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	the	 bio 	 divers 	 ity 	 	on	earth	,	and	much	of	it	we	do	n't	know	about	.
but	i	'll	tell	you	some	of	that	 to 	 day 	 	.
that	 al 	 so 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	even	get	 in 	 to 	 	the	whole	protein	 extra 	 ction 	 	that	we	do	from	the	ocean	.
that	's	about	10	percent	of	our	global	 need 	 s 	 	and	100	percent	of	some	 is 	 land 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	.
if	you	 we 	 re 	 	to	descend	 in 	 to 	 	the	95	percent	of	the	 bio 	 sphere 	 	that	's	 liv 	 able 	 	,	it	would	 quick 	 ly 	 	 be 	 come 	 	pitch	black	,	 interrupt 	 ed 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	by	 pin 	 point 	 s 	 	of	light	from	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nt 	 	 organism 	 s 	 	.
and	if	you	turn	the	 light 	 s 	 	on	,	you	might	 period 	 ically 	 	see	spectacular	 organism 	 s 	 	swim	by	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	 den 	 izen 	 s 	 	of	the	deep	,	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	live	in	the	deep	ocean	.
and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	the	deep	sea	floor	would	come	 in 	 to 	 	view	.
 th 	 is 	 	type	of	 habit 	 at 	 	 cover 	 s 	 	more	of	the	earth	's	surface	than	all	other	 habit 	 at 	 s 	 	 combine 	 d 	 	.
and	yet	,	we	know	more	about	the	surface	of	the	moon	and	about	mars	than	we	do	about	 th 	 is 	 	 habit 	 at 	 	,	 de 	 spite 	 	the	fact	that	we	have	yet	to	 ex 	 tract 	 	a	gram	of	food	,	a	breath	of	oxygen	or	a	drop	of	water	from	 t 	 hose 	 	bodies	.
and	so	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	an	 inter 	 national 	 	program	 beg 	 an 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	census	of	marine	life	,	which	set	out	to	try	and	improve	our	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	life	in	the	global	 ocean 	 s 	 	.
it	 involve 	 d 	 	17	different	 project 	 s 	 	around	the	world	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	these	are	the	 foot 	 print 	 s 	 	of	the	different	 project 	 s 	 	.
and	i	hope	you	'll	appreciate	the	level	of	global	 cover 	 age 	 	that	it	 manage 	 d 	 	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	.
it	all	 beg 	 an 	 	when	two	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	fred	grassle	and	jesse	ausubel	,	met	in	 wood 	 s 	 	hole	,	massachusetts	where	both	 we 	 re 	 	 guest 	 s 	 	at	the	 fame 	 d 	 	 ocean 	 o 	 graphic 	 	institute	.
and	fred	was	 lament 	 ing 	 	the	state	of	marine	 bio 	 divers 	 ity 	 	and	the	fact	that	it	was	in	trouble	and	 noth 	 ing 	 	was	 be 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	about	it	.
well	,	from	that	 discuss 	 ion 	 	grew	 th 	 is 	 	program	that	 involve 	 d 	 	2,700	 scientist 	 s 	 	from	more	than	80	 count 	 ries 	 	around	the	world	who	 engag 	 ed 	 	in	540	ocean	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 s 	 	at	a	 combine 	 d 	 	cost	of	650	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	 stud 	 y 	 	the	 distribut 	 ion 	 	,	 divers 	 ity 	 	and	abundance	of	life	in	the	global	ocean	.
and	so	what	did	we	find	?
we	found	spectacular	new	species	,	the	most	 beaut 	 iful 	 	and	 visual 	 ly 	 	 stunn 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 every 	 where 	 	we	 look 	 ed 	 	--	from	the	 shore 	 line 	 	to	the	abyss	,	form	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	all	the	way	up	to	fish	and	 every 	 thing 	 	in	between	.	and	the	 limit 	 ing 	 	step	here	was	n't	the	 un 	 known 	 	 divers 	 ity 	 	of	life	,	but	 ra 	 ther 	 	the	 tax 	 o 	 nomic 	 	 special 	 ists 	 	who	can	identify	and	catalog	these	species	that	 be 	 came 	 	the	 limit 	 ing 	 	step	.
they	,	in	fact	,	are	an	 en 	 danger 	 ed 	 	species	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
there	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	four	to	five	new	species	 de 	 scribed 	 	 every 	 day 	 	for	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	say	,	it	could	be	a	much	 large 	 r 	 	number	.
now	,	i	come	from	newfoundland	in	canada	--	it	's	an	 is 	 land 	 	off	the	east	coast	of	that	continent	--	where	we	 experience 	 d 	 	one	of	the	worst	 fish 	 ing 	 	 disaster 	 s 	 	in	human	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	photograph	 show 	 s 	 	a	small	boy	next	to	a	codfish	.
it	's	around	1900	.
now	,	when	i	was	a	boy	of	about	his	age	,	i	would	go	out	 fish 	 ing 	 	with	my	 grand 	 father 	 	and	we	would	catch	fish	about	half	that	 s 	 ize 	 	.
and	i	thought	that	was	the	norm	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	had	never	 s 	 een 	 	fish	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
if	you	 we 	 re 	 	to	go	out	there	 to 	 day 	 	,	20	 year 	 s 	 	after	 th 	 is 	 	 fish 	 ery 	 	 collapse 	 d 	 	,	if	you	could	catch	a	fish	,	which	would	be	a	bit	of	a	 challeng 	 e 	 	,	it	would	be	half	that	 s 	 ize 	 	still	.
so	what	we	're	 ex 	 peri 	 encing 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	shifting	 base 	 lines 	 	.
our	 expect 	 ations 	 	of	what	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	can	produce	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	appreciate	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	n't	 s 	 een 	 	it	in	our	 life 	 time 	 s 	 	.
now	most	of	us	,	and	i	would	say	me	 include 	 d 	 	,	think	that	human	 exploit 	 ation 	 	of	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 be 	 came 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	serious	in	the	last	50	to	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	100	 year 	 s 	 	or	so	.
the	census	 actual 	 ly 	 	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	look	back	in	time	,	using	every	source	of	information	they	could	get	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	on	.
and	so	 any 	 thing 	 	from	restaurant	 menu 	 s 	 	to	 mon 	 aste 	 ry 	 	 record 	 s 	 	to	 ship 	 s 	 	'	 log 	 s 	 	to	see	what	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	like	.
 be 	 cause 	 	science	data	 re 	 ally 	 	 go 	 es 	 	back	to	,	at	best	,	world	war	ii	,	for	the	most	part	.
and	so	what	they	found	,	in	fact	,	is	that	 exploit 	 ation 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	 heav 	 ily 	 	with	the	romans	.
and	so	at	that	time	,	of	course	,	there	was	no	 refrige 	 ration 	 	.
so	 fish 	 er 	 men 	 	could	 on 	 ly 	 	catch	what	they	could	either	eat	or	sell	that	day	.
but	the	romans	 develop 	 ed 	 	salting	.
and	with	salting	,	it	 be 	 came 	 	possible	to	store	fish	and	to	transport	it	long	 distance 	 s 	 	.
and	so	 beg 	 an 	 	industrial	 fish 	 ing 	 	.
and	so	these	are	the	 sort 	 s 	 	of	extrapolations	that	we	have	of	what	sort	of	loss	we	've	had	 relat 	 ive 	 	to	pre	-	human	 impact 	 s 	 	on	the	ocean	.
they	range	from	65	to	98	percent	for	these	major	 group 	 s 	 	of	 organism 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 show 	 n 	 	in	the	dark	blue	 bar 	 s 	 	.
now	for	 t 	 hose 	 	species	the	we	 manage 	 d 	 	to	 leav 	 e 	 	 al 	 one 	 	,	that	we	protect	--	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	marine	 mammal 	 s 	 	in	 re 	 cent 	 	 year 	 s 	 	and	sea	 bird 	 s 	 	--	there	is	some	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	.
so	it	's	not	all	 hope 	 less 	 	.
but	for	the	most	part	,	we	've	gone	from	salting	to	 exhaust 	 ing 	 	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	other	line	of	evidence	is	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	one	.
it	's	from	trophy	fish	caught	off	the	coast	of	florida	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	photograph	from	the	1950s	.
i	want	you	to	notice	the	scale	on	the	slide	,	 be 	 cause 	 	when	you	see	the	same	picture	from	the	1980s	,	we	see	the	fish	are	much	 small 	 er 	 	and	we	're	 al 	 so 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	a	change	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	 com 	 position 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	fish	.
by	2007	,	the	catch	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 laugh 	 able 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	 s 	 ize 	 	for	a	trophy	fish	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	no	 laugh 	 ing 	 	matter	.
the	 ocean 	 s 	 	have	lost	a	lot	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 product 	 ivity 	 	and	we	're	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	it	.
so	what	's	left	?	 actual 	 ly 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	a	lot	.
there	's	a	lot	of	 excit 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	a	little	bit	about	them	.
and	i	want	to	start	with	a	bit	on	technology	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	of	course	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	ted	 con 	 ference 	 	and	you	want	to	hear	 some 	 thing 	 	on	technology	.
so	one	of	the	 tool 	 s 	 	that	we	use	to	 s 	 ample 	 	the	deep	ocean	are	 remote 	 ly 	 	 oper 	 ated 	 	 vehicle 	 s 	 	.
so	these	are	 tether 	 ed 	 	 vehicle 	 s 	 	we	lower	down	to	the	sea	floor	where	they	're	our	 eye 	 s 	 	and	our	 hand 	 s 	 	for	 work 	 ing 	 	on	the	sea	bottom	.
so	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	was	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	go	on	an	 ocean 	 o 	 graphic 	 	 cruis 	 e 	 	and	i	could	n't	go	 be 	 cause 	 	of	a	 sch 	 ed 	 ul 	 ing 	 	conflict	.
but	through	a	satellite	link	i	was	able	to	 s 	 it 	 	at	my	 stud 	 y 	 	at	home	with	my	dog	curled	up	at	my	feet	,	a	cup	of	tea	in	my	hand	,	and	i	could	tell	the	pilot	,	``	i	want	a	 s 	 ample 	 	right	there	.	``
and	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	the	pilot	did	for	me	.
that	's	the	sort	of	technology	that	's	 avail 	 able 	 	 to 	 day 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	was	n't	 avail 	 able 	 	even	a	decade	ago	.
so	it	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	 s 	 ample 	 	these	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 habit 	 at 	 s 	 	that	are	 ver 	 y 	 	far	from	the	surface	and	 ver 	 y 	 	far	from	light	.
and	so	one	of	the	 tool 	 s 	 	that	we	can	use	to	 s 	 ample 	 	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	is	 acoustic 	 s 	 	,	or	sound	 wave 	 s 	 	.
and	the	advantage	of	sound	 wave 	 s 	 	is	that	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	pass	well	through	water	,	 un 	 like 	 	light	.
and	so	we	can	 s 	 end 	 	out	sound	 wave 	 s 	 	,	they	 bounc 	 e 	 	off	 object 	 s 	 	like	fish	and	are	 reflect 	 ed 	 	back	.
and	so	in	 th 	 is 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	a	census	scientist	took	out	two	 ship 	 s 	 	.
one	would	 s 	 end 	 	out	sound	 wave 	 s 	 	that	would	 bounc 	 e 	 	back	.
they	would	be	 receiv 	 ed 	 	by	a	second	ship	,	and	that	would	give	us	 ver 	 y 	 	precise	 estimate 	 s 	 	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	of	250	billion	 her 	 ring 	 	in	a	period	of	about	a	minute	.
and	that	's	an	area	about	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	manhattan	 is 	 land 	 	.
and	to	be	able	to	do	that	is	a	tremendous	 fish 	 eries 	 	tool	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 know 	 ing 	 	how	 man 	 y 	 	fish	are	there	is	 re 	 ally 	 	critical	.
we	can	 al 	 so 	 	use	satellite	 tag 	 s 	 	to	track	 animal 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	move	through	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	.
and	so	for	 animal 	 s 	 	that	come	to	the	surface	to	breathe	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	elephant	seal	,	it	's	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	 s 	 end 	 	data	back	to	shore	and	tell	us	where	 exact 	 ly 	 	it	is	in	the	ocean	.
and	so	from	that	we	can	produce	these	 track 	 s 	 	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	the	dark	blue	 show 	 s 	 	you	where	the	elephant	seal	 move 	 d 	 	in	the	north	 pac 	 ific 	 	.
now	i	 real 	 ize 	 	for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	are	 color 	 blind 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	slide	is	not	 ver 	 y 	 	 help 	 ful 	 	,	but	stick	with	me	 non 	 e 	 the 	 less 	 	.
for	 animal 	 s 	 	that	do	n't	surface	,	we	have	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	pop	-	up	 tag 	 s 	 	,	which	collect	data	about	light	and	what	time	the	 s 	 un 	 	 rise 	 s 	 	and	 set 	 s 	 	.
and	then	at	some	period	of	time	it	 pop 	 s 	 	up	to	the	surface	and	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 re 	 lay 	 s 	 	that	data	back	to	shore	.
 be 	 cause 	 	gps	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	under	water	.	that	's	why	we	need	these	 tool 	 s 	 	.
and	so	from	 th 	 is 	 	we	're	able	to	identify	these	blue	 high 	 ways 	 	,	these	hot	 spot 	 s 	 	in	the	ocean	,	that	should	be	real	 prior 	 ity 	 	 area 	 s 	 	for	ocean	 conserv 	 ation 	 	.
now	one	of	the	other	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	may	think	about	is	that	,	when	you	go	to	the	 super 	 market 	 	and	you	buy	 thing 	 s 	 	,	they	're	 s 	 can 	 ned 	 	.
and	so	there	's	a	 bar 	 code 	 	on	that	product	that	 tell 	 s 	 	the	computer	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	the	product	is	.
 genetic 	 ists 	 	have	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	similar	tool	 call 	 ed 	 	genetic	barcoding	.
and	what	barcoding	 do 	 es 	 	is	use	a	specific	gene	 call 	 ed 	 	co	1	that	's	 consist 	 ent 	 	 with 	 in 	 	a	species	,	but	 varie 	 s 	 	among	species	.
and	so	what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	is	we	can	unambiguously	identify	which	species	are	which	even	if	they	look	similar	to	each	other	,	but	may	be	 bio 	 logically 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	different	.
now	one	of	the	 nic 	 est 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	i	like	to	cite	on	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	story	of	two	young	women	,	high	school	 student 	 s 	 	in	new	york	city	,	who	 work 	 ed 	 	with	the	census	.
they	went	out	and	 collect 	 ed 	 	fish	from	 market 	 s 	 	and	from	 restaurant 	 s 	 	in	new	york	city	and	they	barcoded	it	.
well	what	they	found	was	mislabeled	fish	.
so	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	they	found	 some 	 thing 	 	which	was	 s 	 old 	 	 a 	 s 	 	tuna	,	which	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 valu 	 able 	 	,	was	in	fact	tilapia	,	which	is	a	much	less	 valu 	 able 	 	fish	.
they	 al 	 so 	 	found	an	 en 	 danger 	 ed 	 	species	 s 	 old 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	common	one	.
so	barcoding	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	know	what	we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	with	and	 al 	 so 	 	what	we	're	eating	.
the	ocean	 bio 	 geo 	 graphic 	 	information	system	is	the	 data 	 base 	 	for	all	the	census	data	.
it	's	open	access	;	you	can	all	go	in	and	download	data	 a 	 s 	 	you	wish	.
and	it	 contain 	 s 	 	all	the	data	from	the	census	plus	other	data	 set 	 s 	 	that	people	 we 	 re 	 	 will 	 ing 	 	to	 con 	 tribute 	 	.
and	so	what	you	can	do	with	that	is	to	plot	the	 distribut 	 ion 	 	of	species	and	where	they	occur	in	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	.
what	i	've	 plot 	 ted 	 	up	here	is	the	data	that	we	have	on	hand	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	where	our	 s 	 ampl 	 ing 	 	effort	 ha 	 s 	 	 concent 	 rated 	 	.
now	what	you	can	see	is	we	've	 s 	 ampl 	 ed 	 	the	area	in	the	north	atlantic	,	in	the	north	sea	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	the	east	coast	of	north	america	 fair 	 ly 	 	well	.
that	's	the	warm	 color 	 s 	 	which	show	a	well	-	 s 	 ampl 	 ed 	 	region	.
the	cold	 color 	 s 	 	,	the	blue	and	the	black	,	show	 area 	 s 	 	where	we	have	 al 	 most 	 	no	data	.
so	even	after	a	10	-	year	census	,	there	are	large	 area 	 s 	 	that	still	remain	 un 	 explore 	 d 	 	.
now	there	are	a	group	of	 scientist 	 s 	 	living	in	texas	,	 work 	 ing 	 	in	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	of	mexico
who	 decide 	 d 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	labor	of	love	to	pull	together	all	the	knowledge	they	could	about	 bio 	 divers 	 ity 	 	in	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	of	mexico	.
and	so	they	put	 th 	 is 	 	together	,	a	list	of	all	the	species	,	where	they	're	known	to	occur	,	and	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 seem 	 ed 	 	like	a	 ver 	 y 	 	esoteric	,	scientific	type	of	 exercis 	 e 	 	.
but	then	,	of	course	,	there	was	the	deep	horizon	oil	 s 	 pill 	 	.
so	all	of	a	sudden	,	 th 	 is 	 	labor	of	love	for	no	obvious	economic	reason	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	a	critical	piece	of	information	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	how	that	system	is	going	to	 re 	 cover 	 	,	how	long	it	will	take	and	how	the	 law 	 suit 	 s 	 	and	the	multi	-	billion	-	dollar	 discuss 	 ions 	 	that	are	going	to	happen	in	the	coming	 year 	 s 	 	are	 like 	 ly 	 	to	be	resolved	.
so	what	did	we	find	?
well	,	i	could	stand	here	for	 hour 	 s 	 	,	but	,	of	course	,	i	'm	not	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	do	that	.
but	i	will	tell	you	some	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 discover 	 ies 	 	from	the	census	.
so	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	 discover 	 ed 	 	is	where	are	the	hot	 spot 	 s 	 	of	 divers 	 ity 	 	?
where	do	we	find	the	most	species	of	ocean	life	?
and	what	we	find	if	we	plot	up	the	well	-	known	species	is	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	a	 distribut 	 ion 	 	.
and	what	we	see	is	that	for	 coast 	 al 	 	 tag 	 s 	 	,	for	 t 	 hose 	 	 organism 	 s 	 	that	live	near	the	 shore 	 line 	 	,	they	're	most	 divers 	 e 	 	in	the	 tropic 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	we	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	known	for	a	while	,	so	it	's	not	a	real	 break 	 through 	 	.
what	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	is	that	the	 ocean 	 ic 	 	 tag 	 s 	 	,	or	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	live	far	from	the	coast	,	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	more	 divers 	 e 	 	at	 inter 	 mediate 	 	 latitude 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	sort	of	data	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	that	 manage 	 rs 	 	could	use	if	they	want	to	 priori 	 tize 	 	 area 	 s 	 	of	the	ocean	that	we	need	to	 conserv 	 e 	 	.
you	can	do	 th 	 is 	 	on	a	global	scale	,	but	you	can	 al 	 so 	 	do	it	on	a	 region 	 al 	 	scale	.
and	that	's	why	 bio 	 divers 	 ity 	 	data	can	be	so	 valu 	 able 	 	.
now	while	a	lot	of	the	species	we	 discover 	 ed 	 	in	the	census	are	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	small	and	hard	to	see	,	that	 certain 	 ly 	 	was	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	the	case	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	while	it	's	hard	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	a	three	 kilo 	 gram 	 	 lob 	 ster 	 	could	elude	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	it	did	 un 	 til 	 	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	when	south	african	 fish 	 er 	 men 	 	 request 	 ed 	 	an	export	permit	and	 scientist 	 s 	 	 real 	 ized 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	 some 	 thing 	 	new	to	science	.
 similar 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 gold 	 en 	 	v	kelp	 collect 	 ed 	 	in	alaska	just	 be 	 low 	 	the	low	water	mark	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	a	new	species	.
even	 th 	 ough 	 	it	's	three	 meter 	 s 	 	long	,	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 elude 	 d 	 	science	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	guy	,	 th 	 is 	 	bigfin	 s 	 quid 	 	,	is	seven	 meter 	 s 	 	in	length	.
but	to	be	fair	,	it	 live 	 s 	 	in	the	deep	 water 	 s 	 	of	the	mid	-	atlantic	ridge	,	so	it	was	a	lot	 hard 	 er 	 	to	find	.
but	there	's	still	potential	for	 discover 	 y 	 	of	big	and	 excit 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	shrimp	,	we	've	 dub 	 bed 	 	it	the	jurassic	shrimp	,	it	's	thought	to	have	gone	extinct	50	 year 	 s 	 	ago	--	at	 l 	 east 	 	it	was	,	 un 	 til 	 	the	census	 discover 	 ed 	 	it	was	living	and	 do 	 ing 	 	just	fine	off	the	coast	of	australia	.
and	it	 show 	 s 	 	that	the	ocean	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 it 	 s 	 	 vast 	 ness 	 	,	can	hide	 secret 	 s 	 	for	a	 ver 	 y 	 	long	time	.
so	,	steven	spielberg	,	eat	your	heart	out	.
if	we	look	at	 distribut 	 ions 	 	,	in	fact	 distribut 	 ions 	 	change	 dramat 	 ically 	 	.
and	so	one	of	the	 record 	 s 	 	that	we	had	was	 th 	 is 	 	 soot 	 y 	 	shearwater	,	which	 under 	 go 	 es 	 	these	spectacular	 migr 	 ations 	 	all	the	way	from	new	zealand	all	the	way	up	to	alaska	and	back	 aga 	 in 	 	in	search	of	 end 	 less 	 	summer	 a 	 s 	 	they	complete	 the 	 ir 	 	life	 cycle 	 s 	 	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	the	white	 s 	 hark 	 	cafe	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	location	in	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	where	white	 s 	 hark 	 	 converg 	 e 	 	.
we	do	n't	know	why	they	 converg 	 e 	 	there	,	we	 simpl 	 y 	 	do	n't	know	.
that	's	a	question	for	the	future	.
one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	're	taught	in	high	school	is	that	all	 animal 	 s 	 	 requir 	 e 	 	oxygen	in	order	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	little	critter	,	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	about	half	a	millimeter	in	 s 	 ize 	 	,	not	 terr 	 ibly 	 	 charisma 	 tic 	 	.
but	it	was	 on 	 ly 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	in	the	early	1980s	.
but	the	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	about	it	is	that	,	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	census	 scientist 	 s 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	guy	can	 thriv 	 e 	 	in	oxygen	-	poor	 sediment 	 s 	 	in	the	deep	mediterranean	sea	.
so	now	they	know	that	,	in	fact	,	 animal 	 s 	 	can	live	 with 	 out 	 	oxygen	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	some	of	them	,	and	that	they	can	adapt	to	even	the	 harsh 	 est 	 	of	 condition 	 s 	 	.
if	you	 we 	 re 	 	to	suck	all	the	water	out	of	the	ocean	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	you	'd	be	left	 be 	 hind 	 	with	,	and	that	's	the	 bio 	 mass 	 	of	life	on	the	sea	floor	.
now	what	we	see	is	huge	 bio 	 mass 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	 pole 	 s 	 	and	not	much	 bio 	 mass 	 	in	between	.
we	found	life	in	the	 extrem 	 es 	 	.
and	so	there	 we 	 re 	 	new	species	that	 we 	 re 	 	found	that	live	 in 	 side 	 	ice	and	help	to	support	an	ice	-	based	food	web	.
and	we	 al 	 so 	 	found	 th 	 is 	 	spectacular	yeti	crab	that	 live 	 s 	 	near	 boil 	 ing 	 	hot	 hydro 	 thermal 	 	 vent 	 s 	 	at	easter	 is 	 land 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	species	 re 	 ally 	 	 capture 	 d 	 	the	public	's	attention	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	found	the	 deep 	 est 	 	 vent 	 s 	 	known	yet	--	5,000	 meter 	 s 	 	--	the	 hot 	 test 	 	 vent 	 s 	 	at	407	 degree 	 s 	 	celsius	--	 vent 	 s 	 	in	the	south	 pac 	 ific 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	in	the	 arc 	 tic 	 	where	 non 	 e 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	found	before	.
so	even	new	 environment 	 s 	 	are	still	 with 	 in 	 	the	domain	of	the	discoverable	.
now	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	 un 	 known 	 s 	 	,	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	.
and	i	'm	just	going	to	summarize	just	a	few	of	them	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	for	you	.
first	of	all	,	we	might	ask	,	how	 man 	 y 	 	 fish 	 es 	 	in	the	sea	?
we	 actual 	 ly 	 	know	the	 fish 	 es 	 	better	than	we	do	any	other	group	in	the	ocean	other	than	marine	 mammal 	 s 	 	.
and	so	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	 extrapol 	 ate 	 	based	on	rates	of	 discover 	 y 	 	how	 man 	 y 	 	more	species	we	're	 like 	 ly 	 	to	discover	.
and	from	that	,	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 calcul 	 ate 	 	that	we	know	about	16,500	marine	species	and	there	are	 prob 	 ably 	 	 an 	 other 	 	1,000	to	4,000	left	to	go	.
so	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	well	.
we	've	got	about	75	percent	of	the	fish	,	 may 	 be 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	90	percent	.
but	the	 fish 	 es 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	say	,	are	the	best	known	.
so	our	level	of	knowledge	is	much	less	for	other	 group 	 s 	 	of	 organism 	 s 	 	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	figure	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	based	on	a	brand	new	paper	that	's	going	to	come	out	in	the	journal	plos	biology	.
and	what	is	 do 	 es 	 	is	predict	how	 man 	 y 	 	more	species	there	are	on	land	and	in	the	ocean	.
and	what	they	found	is	that	they	think	that	we	know	of	about	nine	percent	of	the	species	in	the	ocean	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	91	percent	,	even	after	the	census	,	still	remain	to	be	 discover 	 ed 	 	.
and	so	that	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	be	about	two	million	species	once	all	is	 s 	 aid 	 	and	 d 	 one 	 	.
so	we	still	have	 quit 	 e 	 	a	lot	of	work	to	do	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 un 	 known 	 s 	 	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	 bacter 	 ium 	 	is	part	of	 mat 	 s 	 	that	are	found	off	the	coast	of	chile	.
and	these	 mat 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	cover	an	area	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	greece	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	 bacter 	 ium 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	visible	to	the	naked	eye	.
but	you	can	imagine	the	 bio 	 mass 	 	that	 represent 	 s 	 	.
but	the	 re 	 ally 	 	 intrigu 	 ing 	 	thing	about	the	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	is	just	how	 divers 	 e 	 	they	are	.
a	single	drop	of	 sea 	 water 	 	could	contain	160	different	 type 	 s 	 	of	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	.
and	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	are	thought	 potential 	 ly 	 	to	contain	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	billion	different	 type 	 s 	 	.
so	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	.	what	are	they	all	 do 	 ing 	 	out	there	?
we	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	n't	know	.
the	most	 excit 	 ing 	 	thing	,	i	would	say	,	about	 th 	 is 	 	census	is	the	role	of	global	science	.
and	so	 a 	 s 	 	we	see	in	 th 	 is 	 	image	of	light	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	night	,	there	are	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 area 	 s 	 	of	the	earth	where	human	 develop 	 ment 	 	is	much	 great 	 er 	 	and	other	 area 	 s 	 	where	it	's	much	less	,	but	between	them	we	see	large	dark	 area 	 s 	 	of	 relat 	 ively 	 	 un 	 explore 	 d 	 	ocean	.
the	other	point	i	'd	like	to	make	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	ocean	's	 interconnect 	 ed 	 	.
marine	 organism 	 s 	 	do	not	care	about	 inter 	 national 	 	 bound 	 aries 	 	;	they	move	where	they	will	.
and	so	the	 import 	 ance 	 	then	of	global	 collabor 	 ation 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	all	the	more	 import 	 ant 	 	.
we	've	lost	a	lot	of	 para 	 dis 	 e 	 	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	these	tuna	that	 we 	 re 	 	once	so	abundant	in	the	north	sea	are	now	 effective 	 ly 	 	gone	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	 trawl 	 s 	 	taken	in	the	deep	sea	in	the	mediterranean	,	which	 collect 	 ed 	 	more	garbage	than	they	did	 animal 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	the	deep	sea	,	that	's	the	environment	that	we	consider	to	be	among	the	most	 pr 	 ist 	 ine 	 	left	on	earth	.
and	there	are	a	lot	of	other	 pressure 	 s 	 	.
ocean	 acid 	 ification 	 	is	a	 re 	 ally 	 	big	issue	that	people	are	 concern 	 ed 	 	with	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	ocean	 warm 	 ing 	 	,	and	the	 effect 	 s 	 	they	're	going	to	have	on	coral	 reef 	 s 	 	.
on	the	scale	of	 decade 	 s 	 	,	in	our	 life 	 time 	 s 	 	,	we	're	going	to	see	a	lot	of	damage	to	coral	 reef 	 s 	 	.
and	i	could	 s 	 pend 	 	the	rest	of	my	time	,	which	is	 get 	 ting 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 limit 	 ed 	 	,	going	through	 th 	 is 	 	 lit 	 any 	 	of	 concern 	 s 	 	about	the	ocean	,	but	i	want	to	end	on	a	more	positive	note	.
and	so	the	grand	 challeng 	 e 	 	then	is	to	try	and	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	we	preserve	what	's	left	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	is	still	spectacular	 beaut 	 y 	 	.
and	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	are	so	productive	,	there	's	so	much	going	on	in	there	that	's	of	relevance	to	 human 	 s 	 	that	we	 re 	 ally 	 	need	to	,	even	from	a	 self 	 ish 	 	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	try	to	do	better	than	we	have	in	the	past	.
so	we	need	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	hot	 spot 	 s 	 	and	do	our	best	to	protect	them	.
when	we	look	at	 picture 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	they	take	our	breath	away	,	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	 help 	 ing 	 	to	give	us	breath	by	the	oxygen	that	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	provide	.
census	 scientist 	 s 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	in	the	rain	,	they	 work 	 ed 	 	in	the	cold	,	they	 work 	 ed 	 	under	water	and	they	 work 	 ed 	 	above	water	 try 	 ing 	 	to	illuminate	the	 won 	 dr 	 ous 	 	 discover 	 y 	 	,	the	still	vast	 un 	 known 	 	,	the	spectacular	 adapt 	 ations 	 	that	we	see	in	ocean	life	.
so	 whet 	 her 	 	you	're	a	yak	 herd 	 er 	 	living	in	the	 mountain 	 s 	 	of	chile	,	 whet 	 her 	 	you	're	a	 stock 	 broker 	 	in	new	york	city	or	 whet 	 her 	 	you	're	a	tedster	living	in	edinburgh	,	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	matter	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	go	so	 s 	 hall 	 	we	.
 thank 	 s 	 	for	 listen 	 ing 	 	.
