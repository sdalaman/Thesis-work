 a 	 s 	 	an	architect	you	design	for	the	present	,	with	an	 aware 	 ness 	 	of	the	past	,	for	a	future	which	is	 essential 	 ly 	 	 un 	 known 	 	.
the	green	agenda	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	agenda	and	issue	of	the	day	.
and	i	'd	like	to	share	some	experience
over	the	last	40	 year 	 s 	 	--	we	 celebr 	 ate 	 	our	 fort 	 ieth 	 	 annivers 	 ary 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	--	and	to	explore	and	to	touch	on	some	 observ 	 ations 	 	about	the	nature	of	 sustain 	 ability 	 	.
how	far	you	can	 anticip 	 ate 	 	,	what	 follow 	 s 	 	from	it	,	what	are	the	 threat 	 s 	 	,	what	are	the	 possibil 	 ities 	 	,	the	 challeng 	 es 	 	,	the	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	?
i	think	that	--	i	've	 s 	 aid 	 	in	the	past	,	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	before	 any 	 body 	 	even	 invent 	 ed 	 	the	 con 	 cept 	 	of	a	green	agenda	,	that	it	was	n't	about	fashion	--	it	was	about	 surviv 	 al 	 	.
but	what	i	never	 s 	 aid 	 	,	and	what	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	going	to	make	the	point	is	,	that	 re 	 ally 	 	,	green	is	cool	.
i	mean	,	all	the	 project 	 s 	 	which	have	,	in	some	way	,	 be 	 en 	 	inspired	by	that	agenda	are	about	a	 celebr 	 atory 	 	 life 	 style 	 	,	in	a	way	 celebr 	 ating 	 	the	 place 	 s 	 	and	the	 space 	 s 	 	which	determine	the	quality	of	life	.
i	 rare 	 ly 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	quote	 any 	 thing 	 	,	so	i	'm	going	to	try	and	find	a	piece	of	paper	if	i	can	,	[	in	]	which	 some 	 body 	 	,	at	the	end	of	last	year	,	 venture 	 d 	 	the	thought	about	what	for	that	individual	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	 import 	 ant 	 	 observ 	 er 	 	,	analyst	,	writer	--	a	guy	 call 	 ed 	 	thomas	friedman	,	who	wrote	in	the	herald	tribune	,	about	2006	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	think	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	to	happen	in	2006	was	that	living	and	 think 	 ing 	 	green	hit	main	street	.
we	 reach 	 ed 	 	a	 tip 	 ping 	 	point	 th 	 is 	 	year	where	living	,	 act 	 ing 	 	,	 design 	 ing 	 	,	 invest 	 ing 	 	and	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	green	came	to	be	 under 	 stood 	 	by	a	critical	mass	of	 citizen 	 s 	 	,	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	and	 official 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	most	 patriot 	 ic 	 	,	 capital 	 istic 	 	,	geo	-	 politic 	 al 	 	and	competitive	thing	they	could	do	.
 h 	 ence 	 	my	 mot 	 to 	 	:	green	is	the	new	red	,	white	and	blue	.	``
and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	 my 	 self 	 	,	in	a	way	,	looking	back	,	``	when	did	that	kind	of	 aware 	 ness 	 	of	the	planet	and	 it 	 s 	 	 f 	 rag 	 ility 	 	first	appear	?	``
and	i	think	it	was	july	20	,	1969	,	when	,	for	the	first	time	,	man	could	look	back	at	planet	earth	.
and	,	in	a	way	,	it	was	buckminster	 full 	 er 	 	who	 co 	 in 	 ed 	 	that	phrase	.
and	before	the	kind	of	collapse	of	the	 commun 	 ist 	 	system	,	i	was	 privilege 	 d 	 	to	meet	a	lot	of	cosmonauts	in	space	city	and	other	 place 	 s 	 	in	russia	.
and	 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	think	back	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	the	first	true	 environment 	 alist 	 s 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	a	kind	of	 pioneer 	 ing 	 	 pass 	 ion 	 	,	 fire 	 d 	 	about	the	 problem 	 s 	 	of	the	aral	sea	.
and	at	that	period	it	was	--	in	a	way	,	a	number	of	 thing 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
buckminster	 full 	 er 	 	was	the	kind	of	green	guru	--	 aga 	 in 	 	,	a	word	that	had	not	 be 	 en 	 	 co 	 in 	 ed 	 	.
he	was	a	design	scientist	,	if	you	like	,	a	poet	,	but	he	 fore 	 saw 	 	all	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 happen 	 ing 	 	now	.
it	's	 an 	 other 	 	subject	.	it	's	 an 	 other 	 	conversation	.
you	can	go	back	to	his	 writing 	 s 	 	:	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	.
it	was	at	that	time	,	with	an	 aware 	 ness 	 	 fire 	 d 	 	by	bucky	's	 prop 	 he 	 cies 	 	,	his	 concern 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	citizen	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	citizen	of	the	planet	,	that	 influence 	 d 	 	my	 think 	 ing 	 	and	what	we	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	at	that	time	.
and	it	's	a	number	of	 project 	 s 	 	.
i	select	 th 	 is 	 	one	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	1973	,	and	it	was	a	master	plan	for	one	of	the	 can 	 ary 	 	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 prob 	 ably 	 	 coincide 	 d 	 	with	the	time	when	you	had	the	planet	earth	's	sourcebook	,	and	you	had	the	 hip 	 pie 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	.
and	there	are	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 qual 	 ities 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 draw 	 ing 	 	,	which	 seek 	 s 	 	to	sum	up	the	 recommend 	 ations 	 	.
and	all	the	 component 	 s 	 	are	there	which	are	now	in	common	parlance	,	in	our	 vocabul 	 ary 	 	,	you	know	,	30	-	odd	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	:
wind	energy	,	 recycl 	 ing 	 	,	 bio 	 mass 	 	,	solar	 cell 	 s 	 	.	and	in	parallel	at	that	time	,	there	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	kind	of	exclusive	design	club	.
people	who	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	design	conscious	 we 	 re 	 	inspired	by	the	work	of	dieter	rams	,	and	the	 object 	 s 	 	that	he	would	create	for	the	company	 call 	 ed 	 	braun	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	going	back	the	mid	-	'50s	,	'60s	.
and	 de 	 spite 	 	bucky	's	 prop 	 he 	 cies 	 	that	 every 	 thing 	 	would	be	miniaturized	and	technology	would	make	an	 in 	 credible 	 	style	--	access	to	comfort	,	to	 a 	 men 	 ities 	 	--	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	to	imagine	that	 every 	 thing 	 	that	we	see	in	 th 	 is 	 	image	,	would	be	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	stylishly	 package 	 d 	 	.
and	that	,	and	more	 be 	 side 	 s 	 	,	would	be	in	the	palm	of	your	hand	.
and	i	think	that	that	digital	revolution	now	is	coming	to	the	point	where	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	virtual	world	,	which	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	so	 man 	 y 	 	people	together	here	,	 final 	 ly 	 	 connect 	 s 	 	with	the	physical	world	,	there	is	the	 re 	 ality 	 	that	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 human 	 ized 	 	,	so	that	digital	world	 ha 	 s 	 	all	the	 friend 	 lines 	 s 	 	,	all	the	 immedi 	 acy 	 	,	the	 orient 	 ation 	 	of	the	analog	world	.
 prob 	 ably 	 	 summ 	 ed 	 	up	in	a	way	by	the	 styl 	 ish 	 	or	 alter 	 native 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	here	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	 gen 	 er 	 ously 	 	had	 gift 	 ed 	 	at	 lunch 	 time 	 	,	the	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	,	which	is	a	further	kind	of	 develop 	 ment 	 	--	and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	inspired	by	the	 in 	 credible 	 	sort	of	sensual	feel	.
a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	object	.
so	,	 some 	 thing 	 	which	in	[	the	]	'50s	,	'60s	was	 ver 	 y 	 	exclusive	 ha 	 s 	 	now	 be 	 come 	 	,	 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	 quit 	 e 	 	inclusive	.
and	the	 re 	 ference 	 	to	the	ipod	 a 	 s 	 	 icon 	 ic 	 	,	and	in	a	way	 e 	 voc 	 ative 	 	of	performance	,	 deliver 	 y 	 	--
 quit 	 e 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	that	[	in	]	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	year	2007	,	the	financial	 time 	 s 	 	 comment 	 ed 	 	that	the	detroit	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	 en 	 vy 	 	the	halo	effect	that	toyota	 ha 	 s 	 	 gain 	 ed 	 	from	the	prius	 a 	 s 	 	the	hybrid	,	energy	-	conscious	vehicle	,	which	 rival 	 s 	 	the	ipod	 a 	 s 	 	an	 icon 	 ic 	 	product	.
and	i	think	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 tempt 	 ing 	 	to	,	in	a	way	,	seduce	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	 architect 	 s 	 	,	or	 any 	 body 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	with	the	design	process	--	that	the	answer	to	our	 problem 	 s 	 	lies	with	 building 	 s 	 	.
 building 	 s 	 	are	 import 	 ant 	 	,	but	they	're	 on 	 ly 	 	a	component	of	a	much	 big 	 ger 	 	picture	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	might	seek	to	 demonst 	 rate 	 	,	if	you	could	 achiev 	 e 	 	the	 im 	 possible 	 	,	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	 perpetu 	 al 	 	motion	,	you	could	design	a	carbon	-	free	house	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
that	would	be	the	answer	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	not	the	answer	.
it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	problem	.
you	can	not	 separat 	 e 	 	the	 building 	 s 	 	out	from	the	 infra 	 structure 	 	of	 cite 	 s 	 	and	the	 mobil 	 ity 	 	of	transit	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	if	,	in	that	bucky	-	inspired	phrase	,	we	draw	back	and	we	look	at	planet	earth	,	and	we	take	a	kind	of	typical	,	 industrial 	 ized 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	then	the	energy	 consum 	 ed 	 	would	be	split	between	the	 building 	 s 	 	,	44	percent	,	transport	,	34	percent	,	and	industry	.	but	 aga 	 in 	 	,	that	 on 	 ly 	 	 show 	 s 	 	part	of	the	picture	.
if	you	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	 building 	 s 	 	together	with	the	 associate 	 d 	 	transport	,	in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	the	transport	of	people	,	which	is	26	percent	,	then	70	percent	of	the	energy	consumption	is	 influence 	 d 	 	by	the	way	that	our	 cite 	 s 	 	and	 infra 	 structure 	 	work	together	.
so	the	 problem 	 s 	 	of	 sustain 	 ability 	 	can	not	be	 separat 	 ed 	 	from	the	nature	of	the	cities	,	of	which	the	 building 	 s 	 	are	a	part	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	if	you	take	,	and	you	make	a	 compar 	 ison 	 	between	a	 re 	 cent 	 	kind	of	city	,	what	i	'll	call	,	simplistically	,	a	north	american	city	--	and	detroit	is	not	a	bad	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	it	is	 ver 	 y 	 	car	dependent	.
the	city	 go 	 es 	 	out	in	annular	 ring 	 s 	 	,	 consum 	 ing 	 	more	and	more	green	space	,	and	more	and	more	 road 	 s 	 	,	and	more	and	more	energy	in	the	transport	of	people	between	the	city	center	--	which	 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	city	center	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 depriv 	 ed 	 	of	the	living	and	just	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	commercial	,	 aga 	 in 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	dead	.
if	you	 compar 	 ed 	 	detroit	with	a	city	of	a	 north 	 ern 	 	european	 ex 	 ample 	 	--	and	munich	is	not	a	bad	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	that	,	with	the	 great 	 er 	 	 depend 	 ence 	 	on	 walk 	 ing 	 	and	 cycl 	 ing 	 	--	then	a	city	which	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	twice	 a 	 s 	 	dense	,	is	 on 	 ly 	 	using	one	-	tenth	of	the	energy	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	you	take	these	 compar 	 able 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	and	the	energy	leap	is	enormous	.
so	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	if	you	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 general 	 ize 	 	,	you	can	 demonst 	 rate 	 	that	 a 	 s 	 	the	density	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	the	bottom	there	,	that	the	energy	 consum 	 ed 	 	 reduc 	 es 	 	 dramat 	 ically 	 	.
of	course	you	ca	n't	 separat 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	out	from	 issue 	 s 	 	like	social	 divers 	 ity 	 	,	mass	transit	,	the	ability	to	be	able	to	walk	a	convenient	distance	,	the	quality	of	civic	 space 	 s 	 	.
but	 aga 	 in 	 	,	you	can	see	detroit	,	in	yellow	at	the	top	,	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	consumption	,	down	 be 	 low 	 	copenhagen	.
and	copenhagen	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	it	's	a	dense	city	,	is	not	dense	 compar 	 ed 	 	with	the	 re 	 ally 	 	dense	cities	.
in	the	year	2000	,	a	 ra 	 ther 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
you	had	for	the	first	time	mega	-	cities	,	[	of	]	5	million	or	more	,	which	 we 	 re 	 	 occur 	 ring 	 	in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	.
and	now	,	out	of	 typical 	 ly 	 	46	cities	,	33	of	 t 	 hose 	 	mega	-	cities	are	in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	.
so	you	have	to	ask	 your 	 self 	 	--	the	 environment 	 al 	 	impact	of	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 chin 	 a 	 	or	india	.
if	you	take	 chin 	 a 	 	,	and	you	just	take	beijing	,	you	can	see	on	that	traffic	system	,	and	the	 poll 	 ution 	 	 associate 	 d 	 	with	the	consumption	of	energy	 a 	 s 	 	the	 car 	 s 	 	expand	at	the	price	of	the	 bi 	 cycle 	 s 	 	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	if	you	put	onto	the	 road 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	is	 current 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	,	1,000	new	 car 	 s 	 	every	day	--	 statistic 	 ally 	 	,	it	's	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 boom 	 ing 	 	auto	market	in	the	world	--
and	the	half	a	billion	 bi 	 cycle 	 s 	 	 serv 	 ing 	 	one	and	a	third	billion	people	are	 reduc 	 ing 	 	.
and	that	 urban 	 ization 	 	is	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	,	 accele 	 rated 	 	pace	.
so	,	if	we	think	of	the	 transit 	 ion 	 	in	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	of	the	 move 	 ment 	 	from	the	land	to	the	cities	,	which	took	200	 year 	 s 	 	,	then	that	same	process	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	20	 year 	 s 	 	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	it	is	 accele 	 rating 	 	by	a	factor	of	10	.
and	 quit 	 e 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	over	 some 	 thing 	 	like	a	60	-	year	period	,	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	the	 doub 	 ling 	 	in	life	 expect 	 ancy 	 	,	over	that	period	where	the	 urban 	 ization 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 treble 	 d 	 	.
if	i	pull	back	from	that	global	picture	,	and	i	look	at	the	 implic 	 ation 	 	over	a	similar	period	of	time	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	technology	--	which	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	tool	,	is	a	tool	for	 design 	 ers 	 	,	and	i	cite	our	own	experience	 a 	 s 	 	a	company	,	and	i	just	 illustr 	 ate 	 	that	by	a	small	 s 	 election 	 	of	 project 	 s 	 	--	then	how	do	you	measure	that	change	of	technology	?
how	 do 	 es 	 	it	affect	the	design	of	 building 	 s 	 	?
and	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	,	how	can	it	lead	to	the	creation	of	 building 	 s 	 	which	 consum 	 e 	 	less	energy	,	create	less	 poll 	 ution 	 	and	are	more	 social 	 ly 	 	 respons 	 ible 	 	?
that	story	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 building 	 s 	 	,	 start 	 ed 	 	in	the	late	'60s	,	early	'70s	.
the	one	 ex 	 ample 	 	i	take	is	a	corporate	 head 	 quarter 	 s 	 	for	a	company	 call 	 ed 	 	willis	and	faber	,	in	a	small	market	town	in	the	 north 	 east 	 	of	england	,	 com 	 mut 	 ing 	 	distance	with	london	.
and	here	,	the	first	thing	you	can	see	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	building	,	the	roof	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	warm	kind	of	 over 	 coat 	 	 blank 	 et 	 	,	a	kind	of	 insula 	 ting 	 	garden	,	which	is	 al 	 so 	 	about	the	 celebr 	 ation 	 	of	public	space	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	for	 th 	 is 	 	community	,	they	have	 th 	 is 	 	garden	in	the	sky	.
so	the	 human 	 istic 	 	ideal	is	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	in	all	 th 	 is 	 	work	,	 encapsul 	 ated 	 	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	by	one	of	my	early	 sketch 	 es 	 	here	,	where	you	can	see	 green 	 ery 	 	,	you	can	see	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	,	you	have	a	 connect 	 ion 	 	with	nature	.
and	nature	is	part	of	the	 gene 	 rator 	 	,	the	driver	for	 th 	 is 	 	building	.
and	 symbol 	 ically 	 	,	the	 color 	 s 	 	of	the	 in 	 terior 	 	are	green	and	yellow	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	 facil 	 ities 	 	like	 swimm 	 ing 	 	 pool 	 s 	 	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 flex 	 time 	 	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	social	heart	,	a	space	,	you	have	contact	with	nature	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	was	1973	.
in	2001	,	 th 	 is 	 	building	 receiv 	 ed 	 	an	 a 	 ward 	 	.
and	the	 a 	 ward 	 	was	about	a	 celebr 	 ation 	 	for	a	building	which	had	 be 	 en 	 	in	use	over	a	long	period	of	time	.
and	the	people	who	'd	 create 	 d 	 	it	came	back	:	the	project	 manage 	 rs 	 	,	the	company	chairmen	then	.
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	you	know	,	``	the	 architect 	 s 	 	,	norman	was	 al 	 ways 	 	going	on	about	 design 	 ing 	 	for	the	future	,	and	you	know	,	it	did	n't	seem	to	cost	us	any	more	.
so	we	humored	him	,	we	 ke 	 pt 	 	him	happy	.	``
the	image	at	the	top	,	what	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	--	if	you	look	at	it	in	detail	,	 re 	 ally 	 	what	it	is	 say 	 ing 	 	is	you	can	wire	 th 	 is 	 	building	.
 th 	 is 	 	building	was	wired	for	change	.
so	,	in	1975	,	the	image	there	is	of	typewriters	.
and	when	the	photograph	was	taken	,	it	's	word	 processor 	 s 	 	.
and	what	they	 we 	 re 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	occasion	was	that	our	 competitor 	 s 	 	had	to	build	new	 building 	 s 	 	for	the	new	technology	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	fortunate	,	 be 	 cause 	 	in	a	way	our	building	was	future	-	 proof 	 ed 	 	.
it	 anticip 	 ated 	 	change	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 change 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	not	known	.
round	about	that	design	period	 lead 	 ing 	 	up	to	 th 	 is 	 	building	,	i	did	a	sketch	,	which	we	 pull 	 ed 	 	out	of	the	 archiv 	 e 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	.
and	i	was	 say 	 ing 	 	,	and	i	wrote	,	``	but	we	do	n't	have	the	time	,	and	we	 re 	 ally 	 	do	n't	have	the	 im 	 mediate 	 	 expert 	 ise 	 	at	a	technical	level	.	``
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	we	did	n't	have	the	technology	to	do	what	would	be	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	on	that	building	.
and	that	would	be	to	create	a	kind	of	three	-	dimensional	bubble	--	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 over 	 coat 	 	that	would	 natural 	 ly 	 	 ventil 	 ate 	 	,	would	breathe	and	would	 serious 	 ly 	 	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	energy	 load 	 s 	 	.
 not 	 with 	 stand 	 ing 	 	the	fact	that	the	building	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	green	building	,	is	 ver 	 y 	 	much	a	 pioneer 	 ing 	 	building	.
and	if	i	fast	-	forward	in	time	,	what	is	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	that	the	technology	is	now	 avail 	 able 	 	and	 celebr 	 atory 	 	.
the	library	of	the	free	university	,	which	 open 	 ed 	 	last	year	,	is	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	that	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	 transit 	 ion 	 	from	one	of	the	 man 	 y 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 sketch 	 es 	 	and	computer	 image 	 s 	 	to	the	 re 	 ality 	 	.
and	a	combination	of	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	here	,	the	kind	of	heavy	mass	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	of	these	book	 stack 	 s 	 	,	and	the	way	in	which	that	is	 en 	 closed 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	skin	,	which	 en 	 able 	 s 	 	the	building	to	be	 ventil 	 ated 	 	,	to	 consum 	 e 	 	 dramat 	 ically 	 	less	energy	,	and	where	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	with	the	 force 	 s 	 	of	nature	.
and	what	is	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	 huge 	 ly 	 	popular	by	the	people	who	use	it	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	coming	back	to	that	thing	about	the	 life 	 style 	 	,	and	in	a	way	,	the	 eco 	 logical 	 	agenda	is	 ver 	 y 	 	much	at	one	with	the	spirit	.
so	it	's	not	a	kind	of	sacrifice	,	 quit 	 e 	 	the	reverse	.
i	think	it	's	a	great	--	it	's	a	 celebr 	 ation 	 	.
and	you	can	measure	the	performance	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	energy	consumption	,	of	that	building	against	a	typical	library	.
if	i	show	 an 	 other 	 	 a 	 spect 	 	of	that	technology	then	,	in	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	 con 	 text 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	building	in	the	alps	in	switzerland	.
 pre 	 fabric 	 ated 	 	from	the	most	 tradition 	 al 	 	of	 material 	 s 	 	,	but	that	material	--	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	technology	,	the	computing	ability	,	the	ability	to	prefabricate	,	make	high	-	performance	 component 	 s 	 	out	of	timber	--	 ver 	 y 	 	much	at	the	cutting	edge	.
and	just	to	give	a	sort	of	 glimps 	 e 	 	of	that	technology	,	the	ability	to	plot	 point 	 s 	 	in	the	sky	and	to	transmit	,	to	transfer	that	information	now	,	 direct 	 ly 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 factor 	 y 	 	.
so	if	you	cross	the	border	--	just	 a 	 cross 	 	the	border	--	a	small	 factor 	 y 	 	in	germany	,	and	here	you	can	see	the	guy	with	his	computer	screen	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	 point 	 s 	 	in	space	are	 communicate 	 d 	 	.

and	then	 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	that	building	to	then	be	clad	in	the	 old 	 est 	 	technology	,	which	is	the	kind	of	hand	-	cut	shingles	.
one	quarter	of	a	million	of	them	 appli 	 ed 	 	by	hand	 a 	 s 	 	the	final	finish	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	way	in	which	that	 work 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	building	,	for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	us	who	can	enjoy	the	 space 	 s 	 	,	to	live	and	visit	there	.
if	i	made	the	leap	 in 	 to 	 	these	new	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	then	how	did	we	--	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	before	that	?
i	mean	,	you	know	,	what	was	life	like	before	the	mobile	phone	,	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	take	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	?
well	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	the	building	still	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
i	mean	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 glimps 	 e 	 	of	the	 in 	 terior 	 	of	our	hong	kong	bank	of	1979	,	which	 open 	 ed 	 	in	1985	,	with	the	ability	to	be	able	to	reflect	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	deep	 in 	 to 	 	the	heart	of	 th 	 is 	 	space	here	.
and	in	the	 ab 	 s 	 ence 	 	of	 computer 	 s 	 	,	you	have	to	 physical 	 ly 	 	model	.
so	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	we	would	put	 model 	 s 	 	under	an	artificial	sky	.
for	wind	 tunnel 	 s 	 	,	we	would	 liter 	 ally 	 	put	them	in	a	wind	tunnel	and	blast	air	,	and	the	 man 	 y 	 	 kilometer 	 s 	 	of	cable	and	so	on	.
and	the	 turn 	 ing 	 	point	was	 prob 	 ably 	 	,	in	our	 term 	 s 	 	,	when	we	had	the	first	computer	.
and	that	was	at	the	time	that	we	 s 	 ought 	 	to	 re 	 design 	 	,	 re 	 invent 	 	the	 air 	 port 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	terminal	four	at	heathrow	,	typical	of	any	terminal	--
big	,	heavy	roof	,	 block 	 ing 	 	out	the	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	,	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 machine 	 ry 	 	,	big	 pipe 	 s 	 	,	whirring	 machine 	 ry 	 	.
and	stansted	,	the	green	 alter 	 native 	 	,	which	uses	natural	light	,	is	a	friendly	place	:	you	know	where	you	are	,	you	can	 re 	 late 	 	to	the	 out 	 side 	 	.
and	for	a	large	part	of	 it 	 s 	 	cycle	,	not	 need 	 ing 	 	electric	light	--	electric	light	,	which	in	turn	 create 	 s 	 	more	heat	,	which	 create 	 s 	 	more	 cool 	 ing 	 	 load 	 s 	 	and	so	on	.
and	at	that	 part 	 icular 	 	point	in	time	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	one	of	the	few	 so 	 lit 	 ary 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	a	little	image	of	the	tree	of	stansted	.
not	going	back	 ver 	 y 	 	far	in	time	,	1990	,
that	's	our	 off 	 ice 	 	.
and	if	you	 look 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 close 	 ly 	 	,	you	'd	see	that	people	 we 	 re 	 	 draw 	 ing 	 	with	 pencil 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 push 	 ing 	 	,	you	know	,	big	 rul 	 ers 	 	and	 triangle 	 s 	 	.
it	's	not	that	long	ago	,	17	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	here	we	are	now	.
i	mean	,	major	 transform 	 ation 	 	.
going	back	in	time	,	there	was	a	 lad 	 y 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	valerie	larkin	,	and	in	1987	,	she	had	all	our	information	on	one	 dis 	 k 	 	.
now	,	every	week	,	we	have	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	84	million	 dis 	 k 	 s 	 	,	which	record	our	 archiv 	 al 	 	information	on	past	,	current	and	future	 project 	 s 	 	.	that	 reach 	 es 	 	21	 kilometer 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	sky	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	view	you	would	get	,	if	you	 look 	 ed 	 	down	on	that	.
but	 mean 	 while 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	know	,	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 protagonist 	 s 	 	like	al	gore	are	 not 	 ing 	 	the	 inexor 	 able 	 	rise	in	temperature	,	set	in	the	 con 	 text 	 	of	that	,

so	it	would	be	 total 	 ly 	 	 renew 	 able 	 	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	 human 	 istic 	 	sketch	,	the	 transl 	 ation 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	public	space	,
but	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	much	a	part	of	the	 eco 	 logy 	 	.
but	here	,	not	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	model	it	for	real	.
 obvious 	 ly 	 	the	wind	tunnel	had	a	place	,	but	the	ability	now	with	the	computer	to	explore	,	to	plan	,	to	see	how	that	would	work	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	 force 	 s 	 	of	nature	:
natural	 ventil 	 ation 	 	,	to	be	able	to	model	the	chamber	 be 	 low 	 	,	and	to	look	at	 bio 	 mass 	 	.
a	combination	of	 bio 	 mass 	 	,	aquifers	,	 burn 	 ing 	 	 veget 	 able 	 	oil	--	a	process	that	,	 quit 	 e 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	was	 develop 	 ed 	 	in	eastern	germany	,	at	the	time	of	 it 	 s 	 	 depend 	 ence 	 	on	the	soviet	 b 	 loc 	 	.
so	 re 	 ally 	 	,	retranslating	that	technology	and	 develop 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	which	was	so	clean	,	it	was	 virtual 	 ly 	 	 poll 	 ution 	 	-	free	.
you	can	measure	it	 aga 	 in 	 	.
you	can	 compar 	 e 	 	how	that	building	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 it 	 s 	 	 e 	 mission 	 	in	 ton 	 s 	 	of	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	per	year	--	at	the	time	that	we	took	that	project	,	over	7,000	 ton 	 s 	 	--
what	it	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	with	natural	gas
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	with	the	 veget 	 able 	 	oil	,	450	 ton 	 s 	 	.
i	mean	,	a	94	percent	 r 	 eduction 	 	--	 virtual 	 ly 	 	clean	.
we	can	see	the	same	 process 	 es 	 	at	work	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	commerce	bank	--	 it 	 s 	 	 depend 	 ence 	 	on	natural	 ventil 	 ation 	 	,	the	way	that	you	can	model	 t 	 hose 	 	 garden 	 s 	 	,	the	way	they	spiral	around	.
but	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	much	about	the	 life 	 style 	 	,	the	quality	--	 some 	 thing 	 	that	would	be	more	 enjoy 	 able 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	place	to	work	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	we	can	measure	the	 r 	 eduction 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	energy	consumption	.
there	is	an	evolution	here	between	the	 project 	 s 	 	,	and	swiss	re	 aga 	 in 	 	 develop 	 s 	 	that	a	little	bit	further	--
the	project	in	the	city	in	london	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	sequence	 show 	 s 	 	the	 build 	 up 	 	of	that	model	.
but	what	it	 show 	 s 	 	first	,	which	i	think	is	 quit 	 e 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	is	that	here	you	see	the	circle	,	you	see	the	public	space	around	it	.
what	are	the	other	ways	of	 put 	 ting 	 	the	same	amount	of	space	on	the	 s 	 ite 	 	?
if	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	you	seek	to	do	a	building	which	 go 	 es 	 	right	to	the	edge	of	the	 pave 	 ment 	 	,	it	's	the	same	amount	of	space	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	you	profile	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	cut	 groove 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	it	.
the	 groove 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	the	kind	of	green	 lung 	 s 	 	which	give	 view 	 s 	 	,	which	give	light	,	 ventil 	 ation 	 	,	make	the	building	fresher	.
and	you	enclose	that	with	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 al 	 so 	 	is	central	to	 it 	 s 	 	 appear 	 ance 	 	,	which	is	a	mesh	of	triangulated	 structure 	 s 	 	--	 aga 	 in 	 	,	in	a	long	 connect 	 ion 	 	 e 	 voc 	 ative 	 	of	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 work 	 s 	 	of	buckminster	 full 	 er 	 	,	and	the	way	in	which	triangulation	can	 in 	 crease 	 	performance	and	 al 	 so 	 	give	that	building	 it 	 s 	 	sense	of	 ident 	 ity 	 	.
and	here	,	if	we	look	at	a	detail	of	the	way	that	the	building	 open 	 s 	 	up	and	 breathe 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	atria	,	the	way	in	which	now	,	with	a	computer	,	we	can	model	the	 force 	 s 	 	,	we	can	see	the	high	pressure	,	the	low	pressure	,	the	way	in	which	the	building	 behav 	 es 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	like	an	 air 	 craft 	 	wing	.
so	it	 al 	 so 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	the	ability	,	all	the	time	,	 regard 	 less 	 	of	the	direction	of	the	wind	,	to	be	able	to	make	the	building	fresh	and	efficient	.
and	 un 	 like 	 	 convention 	 al 	 	 building 	 s 	 	,	the	top	of	the	building	is	 celebr 	 atory 	 	.
it	's	a	 view 	 ing 	 	place	for	people	,	not	 machine 	 ry 	 	.
and	the	base	of	the	building	is	 aga 	 in 	 	about	public	space	.
 compar 	 ing 	 	it	with	a	typical	building	,	what	 happen 	 s 	 	if	we	seek	to	use	 s 	 uch 	 	design	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 re 	 ally 	 	large	-	scale	 think 	 ing 	 	?
and	i	'm	just	going	to	give	two	 image 	 s 	 	out	of	a	kind	of	company	research	project	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	well	known	that	the	dead	sea	is	 dy 	 ing 	 	.
the	level	is	dropping	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	like	the	aral	sea	.
and	the	dead	sea	is	 obvious 	 ly 	 	much	lower	than	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	and	 sea 	 s 	 	around	it	.
so	there	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	project	which	rescues	the	dead	sea	by	creating	a	 pipe 	 line 	 	,	a	pipe	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	above	the	surface	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	buried	,	that	will	 re 	 dress 	 	that	,	and	will	feed	from	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	of	aqaba	 in 	 to 	 	the	dead	sea	.
and	our	 transl 	 ation 	 	of	that	,	using	a	lot	of	the	 think 	 ing 	 	built	up	over	the	40	 year 	 s 	 	,	is	to	say	,	what	if	that	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	just	a	pipe	,	what	if	it	is	a	 life 	 line 	 	?
what	if	it	is	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	where	you	are	,	of	the	grand	 can 	 al 	 	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 tourist 	 s 	 	,	 habit 	 ation 	 	,	 de 	 s 	 al 	 in 	 ation 	 	,	 agricultur 	 e 	 	?
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	water	is	the	 life 	 blood 	 	.
and	if	you	just	go	back	to	the	previous	image	,	and	you	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	area	of	 volatil 	 ity 	 	and	 hostil 	 ity 	 	,	that	a	 un 	 ifying 	 	design	idea	 a 	 s 	 	a	 human 	 itarian 	 	 gest 	 ure 	 	could	have	the	affect	of	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 war 	 ring 	 	 fact 	 ions 	 	together	in	a	 unit 	 ed 	 	cause	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 some 	 thing 	 	that	would	be	 genuine 	 ly 	 	green	and	productive	in	the	widest	sense	.
 infra 	 structure 	 	at	that	large	scale	is	 al 	 so 	 	 in 	 s 	 e 	 par 	 able 	 	from	communication	.
and	 whet 	 her 	 	that	communication	is	the	virtual	world	or	it	is	the	physical	world	,	then	it	's	 absolute 	 ly 	 	central	to	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
and	how	do	we	make	more	 leg 	 ible 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	growing	world	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	in	some	of	the	 place 	 s 	 	that	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	--	 chin 	 a 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	which	in	the	next	ten	 year 	 s 	 	will	create	400	new	 air 	 port 	 s 	 	.
now	what	form	do	they	take	?
how	do	you	make	them	more	friendly	at	that	scale	?
hong	kong	i	refer	to	 a 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	analog	experience	in	a	digital	age	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	 al 	 ways 	 	have	a	point	of	 re 	 ference 	 	.
so	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	we	take	that	and	you	expand	that	further	 in 	 to 	 	the	chinese	 socie 	 ty 	 	?
and	what	is	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	that	that	 produce 	 s 	 	in	a	way	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	the	ultimate	mega	-	building	.
it	is	 physical 	 ly 	 	the	largest	project	on	the	planet	at	the	moment	.
250	--	excuse	me	,	50,000	people	 work 	 ing 	 	24	 hour 	 s 	 	,	seven	 day 	 s 	 	.
 large 	 r 	 	by	17	percent	than	every	terminal	put	together	at	heathrow	--	built	--	plus	the	new	,	un	-	built	terminal	five	.
and	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	here	is	a	building	that	will	be	green	,	that	is	compact	 de 	 spite 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 s 	 ize 	 	and	is	about	the	human	experience	of	travel	,	is	about	friendly	,	is	coming	back	to	that	 start 	 ing 	 	point	,	is	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	much	about	the	 life 	 style 	 	.
and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	these	,	in	the	end	,	 a 	 s 	 	 celebr 	 atory 	 	 space 	 s 	 	.	 a 	 s 	 	hubert	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	over	lunch	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	sort	of	 engag 	 ed 	 	in	conversation	,	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	cities	.
hubert	was	 say 	 ing 	 	,	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 correct 	 ly 	 	,	``	these	are	the	new	 cat 	 hedral 	 s 	 	.	``
and	in	a	way	,	one	 a 	 spect 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	conversation	was	 trigger 	 ed 	 	on	new	year	's	eve	,	when	i	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	olympic	agenda	in	 chin 	 a 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 it 	 s 	 	green	 ambit 	 ions 	 	and	 aspir 	 ations 	 	.
and	i	was	voicing	the	thought	that	--	it	just	 cross 	 ed 	 	my	mind	that	new	year	's	eve	,
a	sort	of	 symbol 	 ic 	 	 turn 	 ing 	 	point	 a 	 s 	 	we	move	from	2006	to	2007	--	that	 may 	 be 	 	,	you	know	,	the	future	was	the	most	 power 	 ful 	 	,	 innov 	 ative 	 	sort	of	nation	.
the	way	in	which	 some 	 body 	 	like	kennedy	 inspiration 	 ally 	 	could	say	,	``	we	put	a	man	on	the	moon	.	``
you	know	,	who	is	going	to	say	that	we	 crack 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	thing	of	the	 depend 	 ence 	 	on	fossil	 fuel 	 s 	 	,	with	all	that	 be 	 ing 	 	held	to	 ran 	 som 	 	by	 r 	 ogue 	 	 regime 	 s 	 	,	and	so	on	.
and	that	's	a	 concert 	 ed 	 	platform	.
it	's	more	than	one	 de 	 vice 	 	,	you	know	,	it	's	 renew 	 able 	 	.
and	i	 voice 	 d 	 	the	thought	that	 may 	 be 	 	at	the	turn	of	the	year	,	i	thought	that	the	inspiration	was	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	come	from	 t 	 hose 	 	other	,	 large 	 r 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	out	there	--	the	chinas	,	the	indias	,	the	asian	-	 pac 	 ific 	 	 tiger 	 s 	 	.
