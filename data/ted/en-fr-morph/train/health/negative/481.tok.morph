i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 intrigu 	 ed 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	question	of	 whet 	 her 	 	we	could	evolve	or	develop	a	sixth	sense	--
a	sense	that	would	give	us	 seam 	 less 	 	access	and	easy	access	to	meta	-	information	or	information	that	may	exist	 some 	 where 	 	that	may	be	relevant	to	help	us	make	the	right	decision	about	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	that	we	're	coming	 a 	 cross 	 	.
and	some	of	you	may	 argu 	 e 	 	,	well	,	do	n't	 to 	 day 	 	's	cell	 phone 	 s 	 	do	that	 al 	 ready 	 	?
but	i	would	say	no	.
when	you	meet	 some 	 one 	 	here	at	ted	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	top	 network 	 ing 	 	place	,	of	course	,	of	the	year	--	you	do	n't	shake	 some 	 body 	 	's	hand	and	then	say	,	``	can	you	hold	on	for	a	moment	while	i	take	out	my	phone	and	google	you	?	``
or	when	you	go	to	the	 super 	 market 	 	and	you	're	 stand 	 ing 	 	there	in	that	huge	aisle	of	different	 type 	 s 	 	of	toilet	 paper 	 s 	 	,	you	do	n't	take	out	your	cell	phone	,	and	open	a	 brow 	 s 	 er 	 	,	and	go	to	a	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	to	try	to	decide	which	of	these	different	toilet	 paper 	 s 	 	is	the	most	 eco 	 logically 	 	 respons 	 ible 	 	purchase	to	make	.
so	we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	have	easy	access	to	all	 th 	 is 	 	relevant	information	that	can	just	help	us	make	optimal	 decision 	 s 	 	about	what	to	do	next	and	what	 action 	 s 	 	to	take	.
and	so	my	research	group	at	the	media	lab	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 develop 	 ing 	 	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 invent 	 ions 	 	to	give	us	access	to	 th 	 is 	 	information	in	a	sort	of	easy	way	,	 with 	 out 	 	 requir 	 ing 	 	that	the	user	 change 	 s 	 	any	of	 the 	 ir 	 	behavior	.
and	i	'm	here	to	unveil	our	 lat 	 est 	 	effort	,	and	most	 success 	 ful 	 	effort	so	far	,	which	is	still	 ver 	 y 	 	much	a	work	in	process	.
i	'm	 actual 	 ly 	 	 wear 	 ing 	 	the	 de 	 vice 	 	right	now	and	we	've	sort	of	 cobble 	 d 	 	it	together	with	 component 	 s 	 	that	are	off	the	shelf	--	and	that	,	by	the	way	,	 on 	 ly 	 	cost	350	 dollar 	 s 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	in	time	.
i	'm	 wear 	 ing 	 	a	camera	,	just	a	simple	 web 	 cam 	 	,	a	 port 	 able 	 	,	 batt 	 ery 	 	-	powered	 project 	 ion 	 	system	with	a	little	mirror	.
these	 component 	 s 	 	communicate	to	my	cell	phone	in	my	pocket	which	 act 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	communication	and	computation	 de 	 vice 	 	.
and	in	the	video	here	we	see	my	student	pranav	mistry	,	who	's	 re 	 ally 	 	the	 gen 	 ius 	 	who	's	 be 	 en 	 	 implement 	 ing 	 	and	 design 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	whole	system	.
and	we	see	how	 th 	 is 	 	system	lets	him	walk	up	to	any	surface	and	start	using	his	 hand 	 s 	 	to	interact	with	the	information	that	is	 project 	 ed 	 	in	front	of	him	.
the	system	 track 	 s 	 	the	four	significant	 finger 	 s 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	he	's	 wear 	 ing 	 	simple	marker	 cap 	 s 	 	that	you	may	 recogn 	 ize 	 	.
but	if	you	want	a	more	 styl 	 ish 	 	version	you	could	 al 	 so 	 	paint	your	 nail 	 s 	 	in	different	 color 	 s 	 	.
and	the	camera	 bas 	 ically 	 	 track 	 s 	 	these	four	 finger 	 s 	 	and	 recogn 	 ize 	 s 	 	any	 gest 	 ures 	 	that	he	's	making	so	he	can	just	go	to	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	a	map	of	long	beach	,	zoom	in	and	out	,	etc	.
the	system	 al 	 so 	 	 recogn 	 ize 	 s 	 	 icon 	 ic 	 	 gest 	 ures 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	``	take	a	picture	``	 gest 	 ure 	 	,	and	then	 take 	 s 	 	a	picture	of	 what 	 ever 	 	is	in	front	of	you	.
and	when	he	then	 walk 	 s 	 	back	to	the	media	lab	,	he	can	just	go	up	to	any	wall	and	project	all	the	 picture 	 s 	 	that	he	's	taken	,	sort	through	them	and	organize	them	,	and	re	-	 s 	 ize 	 	them	,	etc	.	,
 aga 	 in 	 	using	all	natural	 gest 	 ures 	 	.
so	,	some	of	you	most	 like 	 ly 	 	 we 	 re 	 	here	two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	and	saw	the	demo	by	jeff	han	or	some	of	you	may	think	,	``	well	,	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 th 	 is 	 	look	like	the	 micro 	 soft 	 	surface	table	?	``
and	 y 	 es 	 	,	you	 al 	 so 	 	interact	using	natural	 gest 	 ures 	 	,	both	 hand 	 s 	 	,	etc	.
but	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	here	is	that	you	can	use	any	surface	,	you	can	walk	to	up	to	any	surface	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	your	hand	if	 noth 	 ing 	 	else	is	 avail 	 able 	 	and	interact	with	 th 	 is 	 	 project 	 ed 	 	data	.
the	 de 	 vice 	 	is	 complete 	 ly 	 	 port 	 able 	 	,	and	can	be	...
so	one	 import 	 ant 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 	is	that	it	's	 total 	 ly 	 	mobile	.
 an 	 other 	 	even	more	 import 	 ant 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 	is	that	in	mass	production	 th 	 is 	 	would	not	cost	more	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	than	 to 	 day 	 	's	cell	 phone 	 s 	 	and	would	 actual 	 ly 	 	not	sort	of	be	a	 big 	 ger 	 	 pack 	 aging 	 	--	could	look	a	lot	more	 styl 	 ish 	 	than	 th 	 is 	 	version	that	i	'm	 wear 	 ing 	 	around	my	neck	.
but	other	than	 lett 	 ing 	 	some	of	you	live	out	your	 fanta 	 s 	 y 	 	of	looking	 a 	 s 	 	cool	 a 	 s 	 	tom	 cruis 	 e 	 	in	``	 minor 	 ity 	 	report	,	``	the	reason	why	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	is	that	it	 re 	 ally 	 	can	act	 a 	 s 	 	one	of	these	sixth	-	sense	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	that	 give 	 s 	 	you	relevant	information	about	 what 	 ever 	 	is	in	front	of	you	.
so	we	see	pranav	here	going	 in 	 to 	 	the	 super 	 market 	 	and	he	's	 shop 	 ping 	 	for	some	paper	 to 	 wel 	 s 	 	.
and	,	 a 	 s 	 	he	 pick 	 s 	 	up	a	product	the	system	can	 recogn 	 ize 	 	the	product	that	he	's	 pick 	 ing 	 	up	,	using	either	image	 re 	 cognition 	 	or	marker	technology	,	and	give	him	the	green	light	or	an	 o 	 range 	 	light	.
he	can	ask	for	 add 	 ition 	 al 	 	information	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	choice	here	is	a	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	good	choice	,	 give 	 n 	 	his	personal	 cri 	 ter 	 ia 	 	.
some	of	you	may	want	the	toilet	paper	with	the	most	bleach	in	it	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	the	most	 eco 	 logically 	 	-	 respons 	 ible 	 	choice	.
if	he	 pick 	 s 	 	up	a	book	in	the	 book 	 store 	 	,	he	can	get	an	amazon	rating	--
it	 get 	 s 	 	 project 	 ed 	 	right	on	the	cover	of	the	book	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	juan	's	book	,	our	previous	speaker	,	which	 get 	 s 	 	a	great	rating	,	by	the	way	,	at	amazon	.
and	so	,	pranav	 turn 	 s 	 	the	page	of	the	book	and	can	then	see	 add 	 ition 	 al 	 	information	about	the	book	--	 read 	 er 	 	 comment 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	sort	of	information	by	his	 favor 	 ite 	 	critic	,	etc	.
if	he	 turn 	 s 	 	to	a	 part 	 icular 	 	page	he	 find 	 s 	 	an	 annot 	 ation 	 	by	 may 	 be 	 	an	expert	of	a	friend	of	 our 	 s 	 	that	 give 	 s 	 	him	a	little	bit	of	 add 	 ition 	 al 	 	information	about	 what 	 ever 	 	is	on	that	 part 	 icular 	 	page	.
 read 	 ing 	 	the	 news 	 paper 	 	--	it	never	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 out 	 d 	 ated 	 	.
you	can	get	video	 annot 	 ations 	 	of	the	event	that	you	're	 read 	 ing 	 	about
you	can	get	the	 lat 	 est 	 	 s 	 port 	 s 	 	 score 	 s 	 	etc	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	more	controversial	one	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	interact	with	 some 	 one 	 	at	ted	,	 may 	 be 	 	you	can	see	a	word	cloud	of	the	 tag 	 s 	 	,	the	 word 	 s 	 	that	are	 associate 	 d 	 	with	that	person	in	 the 	 ir 	 	blog	and	personal	web	 page 	 s 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	the	student	is	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 camera 	 s 	 	,	etc	.
on	your	way	to	the	 air 	 port 	 	,	if	you	pick	up	your	 board 	 ing 	 	pass	,	it	can	tell	you	that	your	flight	is	 delay 	 ed 	 	,	that	the	gate	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	,	etc	.
and	,	if	you	need	to	know	what	the	current	time	is	it	's	 a 	 s 	 	simple	 a 	 s 	 	 draw 	 ing 	 	a	watch	--	on	your	arm	.
so	that	's	where	we	're	at	so	far	in	 develop 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	sixth	sense	that	would	give	us	 seam 	 less 	 	access	to	all	 th 	 is 	 	relevant	information	about	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	may	come	 a 	 cross 	 	.
my	student	pranav	,	who	's	 re 	 ally 	 	,	like	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	the	 gen 	 ius 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
he	 do 	 es 	 	deserve	a	lot	of	 app 	 laus 	 e 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	do	n't	think	he	's	slept	much	in	the	last	three	 month 	 s 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
and	his	girlfriend	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	not	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	about	him	either	.
but	it	's	not	perfect	yet	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	much	a	work	in	progress	.
and	who	 know 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	in	 an 	 other 	 	10	 year 	 s 	 	we	'll	be	here	with	the	ultimate	sixth	sense	brain	implant	.
thank	you	.
