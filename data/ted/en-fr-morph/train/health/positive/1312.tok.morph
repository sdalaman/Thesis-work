i	've	 s 	 pent 	 	the	last	decade	 subject 	 ing 	 	 my 	 self 	 	to	pain	and	 humil 	 iation 	 	,	 hope 	 fully 	 	for	a	good	cause	,	which	is	self	-	 improve 	 ment 	 	.
and	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	three	 part 	 s 	 	.
so	first	i	 start 	 ed 	 	with	the	mind	.
and	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	try	to	get	 smart 	 er 	 	by	 read 	 ing 	 	the	entire	encyclopedia	britannica	from	a	to	z	--	or	,	more	 precise 	 ly 	 	,	from	``	a	-	ak	``	to	``	zywiec	.	``
and	here	's	a	little	image	of	that	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	year	.
it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	a	 fasci 	 nating 	 	journey	.
it	was	 pain 	 ful 	 	at	 time 	 s 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	for	 t 	 hose 	 	around	me	.
my	wife	 start 	 ed 	 	to	fine	me	one	dollar	for	every	 ir 	 relevant 	 	fact	i	 insert 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	conversation	.
so	it	had	 it 	 s 	 	 down 	 side 	 s 	 	.
but	after	that	,	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	work	on	the	spirit	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	last	year	,	i	grew	up	with	no	 relig 	 ion 	 	at	all	.
i	'm	jewish	,	but	i	'm	jewish	in	the	same	way	the	 o 	 live 	 	garden	is	italian	.
not	 re 	 ally 	 	.
but	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	learn	about	the	 b 	 ible 	 	and	my	heritage	by	 actual 	 ly 	 	 div 	 ing 	 	in	and	 try 	 ing 	 	to	live	it	and	 immers 	 e 	 	 my 	 self 	 	in	it	.
so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	follow	all	the	 rule 	 s 	 	of	the	 b 	 ible 	 	.
and	from	the	ten	 command 	 ments 	 	to	growing	my	beard	--	 be 	 cause 	 	leviticus	 say 	 s 	 	you	can	not	 s 	 have 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	 look 	 ed 	 	like	by	the	end	.
thank	you	for	that	 re 	 action 	 	.
i	look	a	little	like	moses	,	or	ted	kaczynski	.
i	got	both	of	them	.
so	there	was	the	 top 	 i 	 ary 	 	there	.
and	there	's	the	sheep	.
now	the	final	part	of	the	 tri 	 logy 	 	was	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	focus	on	the	body	and	try	to	be	the	 health 	 iest 	 	person	i	could	be	,	the	 health 	 iest 	 	person	 al 	 ive 	 	.
so	that	's	what	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	the	last	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	i	just	 finish 	 ed 	 	a	couple	of	 month 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	i	have	to	say	,	thank	god	.
 be 	 cause 	 	living	so	 health 	 ily 	 	was	 kill 	 ing 	 	me	.
it	was	so	 overwhelm 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	amount	of	 thing 	 s 	 	you	have	to	do	,	it	's	just	mind	-	boggling	.
i	was	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	all	the	 expert 	 s 	 	and	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	sort	of	a	board	of	medical	 advise 	 rs 	 	.
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 tell 	 ing 	 	me	all	the	 thing 	 s 	 	i	had	to	do	.
i	had	to	eat	right	,	 exercis 	 e 	 	,	meditate	,	pet	 dog 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	 lower 	 s 	 	the	blood	pressure	.
i	wrote	the	book	on	a	 tread 	 mill 	 	,	and	it	took	me	about	a	thousand	 mile 	 s 	 	to	write	the	book	.
i	had	to	put	on	 s 	 un 	 screen 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	no	small	feat	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	listen	to	 der 	 ma 	 to 	 logists 	 	,	they	say	that	you	should	have	a	shot	glass	full	of	 s 	 un 	 screen 	 	.
and	you	have	to	 re 	 app 	 ly 	 	it	every	two	to	four	 hour 	 s 	 	.
so	i	think	half	of	my	book	advance	went	 in 	 to 	 	 s 	 un 	 screen 	 	.
i	was	like	a	 glaz 	 ed 	 	 dough 	 nut 	 	for	most	of	the	year	.
there	was	the	 wash 	 ing 	 	of	 hand 	 s 	 	.
i	had	to	do	that	 proper 	 ly 	 	.
and	my	 immuno 	 logist 	 	told	me	that	i	should	 al 	 so 	 	wipe	down	all	of	the	remote	 control 	 s 	 	and	iphones	in	my	house	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	are	just	 org 	 ies 	 	of	 germ 	 s 	 	.
so	that	took	a	lot	of	time	.
i	 al 	 so 	 	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	be	the	 safe 	 st 	 	person	i	could	be	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	a	part	of	health	.
i	was	inspired	by	the	danish	 safe 	 ty 	 	council	.
they	 start 	 ed 	 	a	public	campaign	that	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	a	 walk 	 ing 	 	helmet	is	a	good	helmet	.	``
so	they	 believ 	 e 	 	you	should	not	just	wear	 helmet 	 s 	 	for	 bi 	 king 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	for	 walk 	 ing 	 	around	.
and	you	can	see	there	they	're	 shop 	 ping 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 helmet 	 s 	 	.
well	 yea 	 h 	 	,	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	that	.
now	it	's	a	little	 extrem 	 e 	 	,	i	admit	.
but	if	you	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	the	``	freakonomics	``	 author 	 s 	 	wrote	about	 th 	 is 	 	--	that	more	people	die	on	a	per	mile	 bas 	 is 	 	from	drunk	 walk 	 ing 	 	than	from	drunk	 driv 	 ing 	 	.
so	 some 	 thing 	 	to	think	about	 to 	 night 	 	if	you	've	had	a	couple	.
so	i	 finish 	 ed 	 	,	and	it	was	a	success	in	a	sense	.
all	of	the	 marker 	 s 	 	went	in	the	right	direction	.
my	cholesterol	went	down	,	i	lost	weight	,	my	wife	 stop 	 ped 	 	 tell 	 ing 	 	me	that	i	 look 	 ed 	 	 pregn 	 ant 	 	.
so	that	was	nice	.
and	it	was	 success 	 ful 	 	 over 	 all 	 	.
but	i	 al 	 so 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	i	was	too	 health 	 y 	 	,	and	that	was	 un 	 health 	 y 	 	.
i	was	so	focused	on	 do 	 ing 	 	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	was	 neglect 	 ing 	 	my	 friend 	 s 	 	and	family	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	dan	buettner	can	tell	you	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	strong	social	network	is	so	 cruci 	 al 	 	to	our	health	.
so	i	 finish 	 ed 	 	.
and	i	kind	of	went	 over 	 board 	 	on	the	week	after	the	project	was	over	.
i	went	to	the	dark	side	,	and	i	just	 indulge 	 d 	 	 my 	 self 	 	.
it	was	like	 some 	 thing 	 	out	of	caligula	.
 with 	 out 	 	the	 s 	 ex 	 	part	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	have	three	young	 kid 	 s 	 	,	so	that	was	n't	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
but	the	over	-	eating	and	over	-	 drink 	 ing 	 	,	 definite 	 ly 	 	.
and	i	 final 	 ly 	 	have	 stabil 	 ized 	 	.
so	now	i	'm	back	to	 adopt 	 ing 	 	 man 	 y 	 	--	not	all	;	i	do	n't	wear	a	helmet	 any 	 more 	 	--	but	 dozen 	 s 	 	of	 health 	 y 	 	 behavior 	 s 	 	that	i	 adopt 	 ed 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	my	year	.
it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	a	life	-	changing	project	.
and	i	,	of	course	,	do	n't	have	time	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	all	of	them	.
let	me	just	tell	you	two	 re 	 ally 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
the	first	is	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	was	surprising	to	me	;	i	did	n't	expect	 th 	 is 	 	to	come	out	--	but	i	live	a	much	 quiet 	 er 	 	life	now	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	live	in	 s 	 uch 	 	a	noisy	world	.
there	's	 train 	 s 	 	and	 plane 	 s 	 	and	 car 	 s 	 	and	bill	o'reilly	,	he	's	 ver 	 y 	 	noisy	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	real	 under 	 estimate 	 d 	 	,	under	-	 appreciate 	 d 	 	health	hazard	--	not	just	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 harm 	 s 	 	our	 hear 	 ing 	 	,	which	it	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 do 	 es 	 	,	but	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 initi 	 ates 	 	the	fight	-	or	-	flight	 respons 	 e 	 	.
a	loud	noise	will	get	your	fight	-	or	-	flight	 respons 	 e 	 	going	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	,	over	the	 year 	 s 	 	,	can	cause	real	damage	,	 cardio 	 vascular 	 	damage	.
the	world	health	 organ 	 ization 	 	just	did	a	big	 stud 	 y 	 	that	they	 publish 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	.
and	it	was	 d 	 one 	 	in	europe	.
and	they	 estimate 	 d 	 	that	1.6	million	 year 	 s 	 	of	 health 	 y 	 	living	are	lost	every	year	in	europe	 be 	 cause 	 	of	noise	 poll 	 ution 	 	.
so	they	think	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 dead 	 ly 	 	.
and	by	the	way	,	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 terr 	 ible 	 	for	your	brain	.
it	 re 	 ally 	 	 impair 	 s 	 	cognition	.
and	our	 found 	 ing 	 	 father 	 s 	 	 k 	 new 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
when	they	wrote	the	 constit 	 ution 	 	,	they	put	dirt	all	over	the	 cobble 	 stone 	 s 	 	 out 	 side 	 	the	hall	so	that	they	could	 concent 	 rate 	 	.
so	 with 	 out 	 	noise	 r 	 eduction 	 	technology	,	our	country	would	not	exist	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	a	patriot	,	i	felt	it	was	 import 	 ant 	 	to	--	i	wear	all	the	 ear 	 plug 	 s 	 	and	the	 ear 	 phone 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 improv 	 ed 	 	my	life	in	a	surprising	and	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	way	.
and	the	second	point	i	want	to	make	,	the	final	point	,	is	that	--	and	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	theme	of	tedmed	--	that	joy	is	so	 import 	 ant 	 	to	your	health	,	that	 ver 	 y 	 	few	of	these	 behavior 	 s 	 	will	stick	with	me	 un 	 less 	 	there	's	some	sense	of	pleasure	and	joy	in	them	.
and	just	to	give	you	one	 in 	 stance 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	:	food	.
the	junk	food	industry	is	 re 	 ally 	 	great	at	 press 	 ing 	 	our	pleasure	 button 	 s 	 	and	 figur 	 ing 	 	out	what	's	the	most	 pleas 	 ur 	 able 	 	.
but	i	think	we	can	use	 the 	 ir 	 	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	and	 app 	 ly 	 	them	to	 health 	 y 	 	food	.
to	give	just	one	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	we	love	 crunch 	 iness 	 	,	 mouth 	 feel 	 	.
so	i	 bas 	 ically 	 	have	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	 in 	 corporate 	 	 crunch 	 iness 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	lot	of	my	 recipe 	 s 	 	--	throw	in	some	 s 	 un 	 flower 	 	 seed 	 s 	 	.
and	you	can	 al 	 most 	 	trick	 your 	 self 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	you	're	eating	doritos	.
and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	made	me	a	 health 	 ier 	 	person	.
the	book	about	it	 come 	 s 	 	out	in	april	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	drop	dead	 health 	 y 	 	.	``
and	i	hope	that	i	do	n't	get	sick	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	book	tour	.
that	's	my	 great 	 est 	 	hope	.
so	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
