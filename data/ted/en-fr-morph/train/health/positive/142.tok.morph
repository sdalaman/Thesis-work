i	'm	going	to	talk	to	you	 to 	 day 	 	about	 hope 	 fully 	 	 convert 	 ing 	 	fear	 in 	 to 	 	hope	.
when	we	go	to	the	physician	 to 	 day 	 	--	when	we	go	to	the	doctor	's	 off 	 ice 	 	and	we	walk	in	,	there	are	 word 	 s 	 	that	we	just	do	n't	want	to	hear	.
there	are	 word 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 tru 	 ly 	 	 af 	 raid 	 	of	.
diabetes	,	cancer	,	parkinson	's	,	alzheimer	's	,	heart	failure	,	lung	failure	--
 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	know	are	 debilit 	 ating 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	,	for	which	there	's	 relat 	 ively 	 	little	that	can	be	 d 	 one 	 	.
and	what	i	want	to	lay	out	for	you	 to 	 day 	 	is	a	different	way	of	 think 	 ing 	 	about	how	to	treat	 debilit 	 ating 	 	disease	,	why	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	,
why	 with 	 out 	 	it	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	our	health	care	system	will	melt	down	if	you	think	it	 al 	 ready 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	,
and	where	we	are	 clinic 	 ally 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	and	where	we	might	go	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	,	and	what	some	of	the	 hurdle 	 s 	 	are	.
and	we	're	going	to	do	all	of	that	in	18	 minute 	 s 	 	,	i	promise	.
i	want	to	start	with	 th 	 is 	 	slide	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	slide	sort	of	 tell 	 s 	 	the	story	the	way	science	magazine	 think 	 s 	 	of	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	an	issue	from	2002	that	they	 publish 	 ed 	 	with	a	lot	of	different	 article 	 s 	 	on	the	 bio 	 nic 	 	human	.
it	was	 bas 	 ically 	 	a	 re 	 generative 	 	medicine	issue	.
 re 	 generative 	 	medicine	is	an	 extra 	 ordinari 	 ly 	 	simple	 con 	 cept 	 	that	 every 	 body 	 	can	understand	.
it	's	 simpl 	 y 	 	 accele 	 rating 	 	the	pace	at	which	the	body	 heal 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	to	a	 clinic 	 ally 	 	relevant	 time 	 scale 	 	.
so	we	know	how	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	ways	that	are	up	there	.
we	know	that	if	we	have	a	 damage 	 d 	 	hip	,	you	can	put	an	artificial	hip	in	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	idea	that	science	magazine	used	on	 the 	 ir 	 	front	cover	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	complete	 anti 	 thesis 	 	of	 re 	 generative 	 	medicine	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 re 	 generative 	 	medicine	.
 re 	 generative 	 	medicine	is	what	business	week	put	up	when	they	did	a	story	about	 re 	 generative 	 	medicine	not	too	long	ago	.
the	idea	is	that	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 figur 	 ing 	 	out	how	to	 amelio 	 rate 	 	 symptom 	 s 	 	with	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	and	 drug 	 s 	 	and	the	like	--	and	i	'll	come	back	to	that	theme	a	few	 time 	 s 	 	--	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 do 	 ing 	 	that	,	we	will	 re 	 generate 	 	lost	function	of	the	body	by	 re 	 generating 	 	the	function	of	 organ 	 s 	 	and	 damage 	 d 	 	tissue	.
so	that	at	the	end	of	the	 treat 	 ment 	 	,	you	are	the	same	 a 	 s 	 	you	 we 	 re 	 	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	 treat 	 ment 	 	.
 ver 	 y 	 	few	good	 idea 	 s 	 	--	if	you	agree	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	good	idea	--	 ver 	 y 	 	few	good	 idea 	 s 	 	are	 tru 	 ly 	 	novel	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	the	same	.
if	you	look	back	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	charles	lindbergh	,	who	was	better	known	for	 fly 	 ing 	 	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	,	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	one	of	the	first	people	 a 	 long 	 	with	alexis	carrel	,	one	of	the	 no 	 bel 	 	 laureate 	 s 	 	from	rockefeller	,	to	begin	to	think	about	,	could	you	culture	 organ 	 s 	 	?
and	they	 publish 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	book	in	1937	,	where	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	to	think	about	,	what	could	you	do	in	bio	-	 reactor 	 s 	 	to	grow	whole	 organ 	 s 	 	?
we	've	come	a	long	way	since	then	.
i	'm	going	to	share	with	you	some	of	the	 excit 	 ing 	 	work	that	's	going	on	.
but	before	 do 	 ing 	 	that	,	what	i	'd	like	to	do	is	share	my	 depress 	 ion 	 	about	the	health	care	system	and	the	need	for	 th 	 is 	 	with	you	.
 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 talk 	 s 	 	 yester 	 day 	 	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	 improv 	 ing 	 	the	quality	of	life	,	and	 reduc 	 ing 	 	poverty	,
and	 essential 	 ly 	 	increasing	life	 expect 	 ancy 	 	all	around	the	 glob 	 e 	 	.
one	of	the	 challeng 	 es 	 	is	that	the	 rich 	 er 	 	we	are	,	the	 long 	 er 	 	we	live	.
and	the	 long 	 er 	 	we	live	,	the	more	expensive	it	is	to	take	care	of	our	 disease 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	get	 old 	 er 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 simpl 	 y 	 	the	wealth	of	a	country	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	the	percent	of	population	over	the	age	of	65	.
and	you	can	 bas 	 ically 	 	see	that	the	 rich 	 er 	 	a	country	is	,	the	 old 	 er 	 	the	people	are	 with 	 in 	 	it	.
why	is	 th 	 is 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	?
and	why	is	 th 	 is 	 	a	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 dramat 	 ic 	 	 challeng 	 e 	 	right	now	?
if	the	average	age	of	your	population	is	30	,	then	the	average	kind	of	disease	that	you	have	to	treat	is	 may 	 be 	 	a	broken	ankle	every	now	and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	a	little	bit	of	asthma	.
if	the	average	age	in	your	country	is	45	to	55	,	now	the	average	person	is	looking	at	diabetes	,	early	-	 on 	 set 	 	diabetes	,	heart	failure	,	 cor 	 on 	 ary 	 	 art 	 ery 	 	disease	--
 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 inherent 	 ly 	 	more	difficult	to	treat	,	and	much	more	expensive	to	treat	.
just	have	a	look	at	the	 demo 	 graphic 	 s 	 	in	the	u.s.	here	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	from	``	the	 untie 	 d 	 	 state 	 s 	 	of	america	.	``
in	1930	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	41	 work 	 ers 	 	per	 retire 	 e 	 	.
41	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	 out 	 side 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	sick	,	 pay 	 ing 	 	for	the	one	 retire 	 e 	 	who	was	 ex 	 peri 	 encing 	 	 debilit 	 ating 	 	disease	.
in	2010	,	two	 work 	 ers 	 	per	 retire 	 e 	 	in	the	u.s	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 match 	 ed 	 	in	every	 industrial 	 ized 	 	,	 wealth 	 y 	 	country	in	the	world	.
how	can	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	afford	to	treat	 patient 	 s 	 	when	the	 re 	 ality 	 	of	 get 	 ting 	 	old	 look 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	age	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	cost	of	health	care	.
and	you	can	see	that	right	around	age	45	,	40	to	45	,	there	's	a	sudden	spike	in	the	cost	of	health	care	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.	if	you	do	the	right	 stud 	 ies 	 	,	you	can	look	at	how	much	you	 a 	 s 	 	an	individual	 s 	 pend 	 	on	your	own	health	care	,	 plot 	 ted 	 	over	your	 life 	 time 	 	.
and	about	seven	 year 	 s 	 	before	you	're	about	to	die	,	there	's	a	spike	.
and	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	--	we	wo	n't	get	 in 	 to 	 	that	.
there	are	 ver 	 y 	 	few	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	few	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	can	 re 	 ally 	 	do	that	will	change	the	way	that	you	can	treat	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 disease 	 s 	 	and	experience	what	i	would	call	 health 	 y 	 	aging	.
i	'd	suggest	there	are	four	 thing 	 s 	 	,
and	 non 	 e 	 	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	include	an	 insur 	 ance 	 	system	or	a	legal	system	.
all	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	do	is	change	who	 pay 	 s 	 	.
they	do	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	change	what	the	actual	cost	of	the	 treat 	 ment 	 	is	.
one	thing	you	can	do	is	not	treat	.	you	can	ration	health	care	.
we	wo	n't	talk	about	that	 any 	 more 	 	.	it	's	too	 depress 	 ing 	 	.
you	can	prevent	.
 obvious 	 ly 	 	a	lot	of	 mon 	 ies 	 	should	be	put	 in 	 to 	 	 prevent 	 ion 	 	.
but	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	most	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	to	me	 any 	 way 	 	,	and	most	 import 	 ant 	 	,	is	the	idea	of	 diagnos 	 ing 	 	a	disease	much	 ear 	 lier 	 	on	in	the	 progress 	 ion 	 	,	and	then	 treat 	 ing 	 	the	disease	to	cure	the	disease	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 treat 	 ing 	 	a	symptom	.
think	of	it	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	diabetes	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	with	diabetes	,	what	do	we	do	?
we	 diagnos 	 e 	 	the	disease	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	once	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 symptom 	 atic 	 	,	and	then	we	treat	the	symptom	for	10	,	20	,	30	,	40	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	we	do	ok	.	insulin	's	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	therapy	.
but	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	it	 stop 	 s 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	,	and	diabetes	 lead 	 s 	 	to	a	 predict 	 able 	 	 on 	 set 	 	of	 debilit 	 ating 	 	disease	.
why	could	n't	we	just	inject	the	 pan 	 cre 	 a 	 s 	 	with	 some 	 thing 	 	to	 re 	 generate 	 	the	 pan 	 cre 	 a 	 s 	 	early	on	in	the	disease	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	even	before	it	was	 symptom 	 atic 	 	?
and	it	might	be	a	little	bit	expensive	at	the	time	that	we	did	it	,	but	if	it	 work 	 ed 	 	,	we	would	 tru 	 ly 	 	be	able	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	different	.
 th 	 is 	 	video	,	i	think	,	 get 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 con 	 cept 	 	that	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 quit 	 e 	 	 dramat 	 ically 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 new 	 t 	 	re	-	growing	 it 	 s 	 	limb	.
if	a	 new 	 t 	 	can	do	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	thing	,	why	ca	n't	we	?
i	'll	 actual 	 ly 	 	show	you	some	more	 import 	 ant 	 	 feature 	 s 	 	about	limb	 re 	 generation 	 	in	a	moment	.
but	what	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	in	 re 	 generative 	 	medicine	is	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	every	organ	system	of	the	body	,	for	 tissue 	 s 	 	and	for	 organ 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
so	 to 	 day 	 	's	 re 	 ality 	 	is	that	if	we	get	sick	,	the	 mess 	 age 	 	is	we	will	treat	your	 symptom 	 s 	 	,	and	you	need	to	adjust	to	a	new	way	of	life	.
i	would	pose	to	you	that	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	--	and	when	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	is	we	could	debate	,	but	it	's	 with 	 in 	 	the	 foresee 	 able 	 	future	--	we	will	talk	about	 re 	 generative 	 	 rehabilit 	 ation 	 	.
there	's	a	limb	 prost 	 hetic 	 	up	here	,	similar	 actual 	 ly 	 	one	on	the	soldier	that	's	come	back	from	 ir 	 aq 	 	.
there	are	370	 soldier 	 s 	 	that	have	come	back	from	 ir 	 aq 	 	that	have	lost	 limb 	 s 	 	.
imagine	if	 in 	 stead 	 	of	facing	that	,	they	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	face	the	 re 	 generation 	 	of	that	limb	.
it	's	a	wild	 con 	 cept 	 	.
i	'll	show	you	where	we	are	at	the	moment	in	 work 	 ing 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	that	 con 	 cept 	 	.
but	it	's	 appli 	 cable 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	to	every	organ	system	.
how	can	we	do	that	?
the	way	to	do	that	is	to	develop	a	conversation	with	the	body	.
we	need	to	learn	to	speak	the	body	's	language	.
and	to	 s 	 witch 	 	on	 process 	 es 	 	that	we	 k 	 new 	 	how	to	do	when	we	 we 	 re 	 	a	fetus	.
a	 mammal 	 ian 	 	fetus	,	if	it	 lose 	 s 	 	a	limb	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	first	 trim 	 est 	 er 	 	of	 pregn 	 ancy 	 	,	will	re	-	grow	that	limb	.
so	our	dna	 ha 	 s 	 	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	do	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	wound	-	 heal 	 ing 	 	 mechan 	 ism 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	natural	process	,	but	it	is	lost	 a 	 s 	 	we	age	.
in	a	child	,	before	the	age	of	about	six	 month 	 s 	 	,	if	they	lose	 the 	 ir 	 	 finger 	 tip 	 	in	an	accident	,	they	'll	re	-	grow	 the 	 ir 	 	 finger 	 tip 	 	.
by	the	time	they	're	five	,	they	wo	n't	be	able	to	do	that	 any 	 more 	 	.
so	to	engage	in	that	conversation	with	the	body	,	we	need	to	speak	the	body	's	language	.
and	there	are	certain	 tool 	 s 	 	in	our	 tool 	 box 	 	that	allow	us	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	three	of	these	 tool 	 s 	 	through	which	to	 con 	 verse 	 	with	the	body	.
the	first	is	cellular	 ther 	 a 	 pies 	 	.
 clear 	 ly 	 	,	we	heal	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	a	natural	process	,	using	 cell 	 s 	 	to	do	most	of	the	work	.
 there 	 fore 	 	,	if	we	can	find	the	right	 cell 	 s 	 	and	implant	them	in	the	body	,	they	may	do	the	 heal 	 ing 	 	.
 second 	 ly 	 	,	we	can	use	 material 	 s 	 	.
we	heard	 yester 	 day 	 	about	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	new	 material 	 s 	 	.
if	we	can	invent	 material 	 s 	 	,	design	 material 	 s 	 	,	or	 ex 	 tract 	 	 material 	 s 	 	from	a	natural	environment	,	then	we	might	be	able	to	have	 t 	 hose 	 	 material 	 s 	 	induce	the	body	to	heal	 it 	 self 	 	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	we	may	be	able	to	use	smart	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	that	will	 off 	 load 	 	the	work	of	the	body	and	allow	it	to	heal	.
i	'm	going	to	show	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	each	of	these	,	and	i	'm	going	to	start	with	 material 	 s 	 	.
steve	badylak	--	who	's	at	the	university	of	pittsburgh	--	about	a	decade	ago	had	a	 remark 	 able 	 	idea	.
and	that	idea	was	that	the	small	intestine	of	a	pig	,	if	you	threw	away	all	the	 cell 	 s 	 	,	and	if	you	did	that	in	a	way	that	 allow 	 ed 	 	it	to	remain	 bio 	 logically 	 	active	,	may	contain	all	of	the	 necess 	 ary 	 	 factor 	 s 	 	and	 signal 	 s 	 	that	would	signal	the	body	to	heal	 it 	 self 	 	.
and	he	 ask 	 ed 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	question	.
he	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	question	,	if	i	take	that	material	,	which	is	a	natural	material	that	 usual 	 ly 	 	 induce 	 s 	 	 heal 	 ing 	 	in	the	small	intestine	,	and	i	place	it	 some 	 where 	 	else	on	a	person	's	body	,	would	it	give	a	tissue	-	specific	 respons 	 e 	 	,	or	would	it	make	small	intestine	if	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	make	a	new	ear	?
i	would	n't	be	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	 th 	 is 	 	story	if	it	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 compel 	 ling 	 	.
the	picture	i	'm	about	to	show	you
 how 	 ever 	 	,	for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	that	are	even	the	 s 	 light 	 est 	 	bit	 squeam 	 ish 	 	--	even	 th 	 ough 	 	you	may	not	like	to	admit	it	in	front	of	your	 friend 	 s 	 	--	the	 light 	 s 	 	are	down	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	good	time	to	look	at	your	feet	,	check	your	 black 	 berry 	 	,	do	 any 	 thing 	 	other	than	look	at	the	screen	.
what	i	'm	about	to	show	you	is	a	diabetic	ulcer	.
and	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	--	it	's	good	to	laugh	before	we	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 re 	 ality 	 	of	diabetes	.
i	think	a	lot	of	 time 	 s 	 	we	hear	about	 diabetic 	 s 	 	,	diabetic	 ulcer 	 s 	 	,	we	just	do	n't	connect	the	ulcer	with	the	 event 	 ual 	 	 treat 	 ment 	 	,	which	is	 amput 	 ation 	 	,	if	you	ca	n't	heal	it	.
so	i	'm	going	to	put	the	slide	up	now	.	it	wo	n't	be	up	for	long	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	diabetic	ulcer	.	it	's	tragic	.
the	 treat 	 ment 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	is	 amput 	 ation 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 old 	 er 	 	 lad 	 y 	 	.	she	 ha 	 s 	 	cancer	of	the	liver	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	diabetes	,	and	 ha 	 s 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	to	die	with	what	's	left	of	her	body	 in 	 tact 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 lad 	 y 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	,	after	a	year	of	 attempt 	 ed 	 	 treat 	 ment 	 	of	that	ulcer	,	that	she	would	try	 th 	 is 	 	new	therapy	that	steve	 invent 	 ed 	 	.
that	's	what	the	wound	 look 	 ed 	 	like	11	 week 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
that	material	 contain 	 ed 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	natural	 signal 	 s 	 	.
and	that	material	induced	the	body	to	 s 	 witch 	 	back	on	a	 heal 	 ing 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	that	it	did	n't	have	before	.
there	's	going	to	be	a	couple	more	 di 	 stress 	 ing 	 	 slide 	 s 	 	for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	--	i	'll	let	you	know	when	you	can	look	 aga 	 in 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	horse	.	the	horse	is	not	in	pain	.
if	the	horse	was	in	pain	,	i	would	n't	show	you	 th 	 is 	 	slide	.
the	horse	just	 ha 	 s 	 	 an 	 other 	 	nostril	that	's	 develop 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	a	 rid 	 ing 	 	accident	.
just	a	few	 week 	 s 	 	after	 treat 	 ment 	 	--	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	taking	that	material	,	 turn 	 ing 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	gel	,	and	 pack 	 ing 	 	that	area	,	and	then	 repeat 	 ing 	 	the	 treat 	 ment 	 	a	few	 time 	 s 	 	--	and	the	horse	 heal 	 s 	 	up	.
and	if	you	took	an	 ultra 	 sound 	 	of	that	area	,	it	would	look	great	.
here	's	a	dolphin	where	the	fin	's	 be 	 en 	 	re	-	 attach 	 ed 	 	.
there	are	now	400,000	 patient 	 s 	 	around	the	world	who	have	used	that	material	to	heal	 the 	 ir 	 	 wound 	 s 	 	.
could	you	 re 	 generate 	 	a	limb	?
darpa	just	 g 	 ave 	 	steve	15	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	lead	an	eight	-	institution	project	to	begin	the	process	of	 ask 	 ing 	 	that	question	.
and	i	'll	show	you	the	15	million	dollar	picture	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	78	year	-	old	man	who	's	lost	the	end	of	his	 finger 	 tip 	 	.
remember	that	i	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	before	the	children	who	lose	 the 	 ir 	 	 finger 	 tip 	 s 	 	.
after	 treat 	 ment 	 	that	's	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 clinic 	 ally 	 	relevant	 to 	 day 	 	.
there	are	 material 	 s 	 	that	do	 th 	 is 	 	.	here	are	the	heart	 patch 	 es 	 	.
but	could	you	go	a	little	further	?
could	you	,	say	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	using	material	,	can	i	take	some	 cell 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	with	the	material	,	and	 re 	 move 	 	a	 damage 	 d 	 	piece	of	tissue	,	put	a	bio	-	degradable	material	on	there	?
you	can	see	here	a	little	bit	of	heart	muscle	 beat 	 ing 	 	in	a	dish	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	 d 	 one 	 	by	teruo	okano	at	tokyo	women	's	hospital	.
he	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	grow	 beat 	 ing 	 	tissue	in	a	dish	.
he	 chill 	 s 	 	the	dish	,	it	 change 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 proper 	 ties 	 	and	he	 peel 	 s 	 	it	right	out	of	the	dish	.
it	's	the	 cool 	 est 	 	stuff	.
now	i	'm	going	to	show	you	cell	-	based	 re 	 generation 	 	.
and	what	i	'm	going	to	show	you	here	is	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	from	the	hip	of	a	patient	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	if	you	're	 squeam 	 ish 	 	,	you	do	n't	want	to	watch	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	one	's	kind	of	cool	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	bypass	operation	,	just	like	what	al	gore	had	,	with	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	at	the	end	of	the	bypass	operation	,	you	're	going	to	see	the	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	from	the	patient	that	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	procedure	 be 	 ing 	 	 inject 	 ed 	 	 direct 	 ly 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	heart	of	the	patient	.
and	i	'm	 stand 	 ing 	 	up	here	 be 	 cause 	 	at	one	point	i	'm	going	to	show	you	just	how	early	 th 	 is 	 	technology	is	.
here	go	the	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	,	right	 in 	 to 	 	the	 beat 	 ing 	 	heart	of	the	patient	.
and	if	you	look	 re 	 ally 	 	 care 	 fully 	 	,	it	's	going	to	be	right	around	 th 	 is 	 	point	you	'll	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	a	back	-	flush	.
you	see	the	 cell 	 s 	 	coming	back	out	.
we	need	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	new	technology	,	new	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	,	to	get	the	 cell 	 s 	 	to	the	right	place	at	the	right	time	.
just	a	little	bit	of	data	,	a	 tin 	 y 	 	bit	of	data	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	 random 	 ized 	 	trial	.
at	 th 	 is 	 	time	 th 	 is 	 	was	an	n	of	20.	now	there	's	an	n	of	about	100	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	,	if	you	take	an	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	sick	patient	and	you	give	them	a	bypass	,	they	get	a	little	bit	better	.
if	you	give	them	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	bypass	,	for	these	 part 	 icular 	 	 patient 	 s 	 	,	they	 be 	 came 	 	 a 	 symptom 	 atic 	 	.
these	are	now	two	 year 	 s 	 	out	.
the	 cool 	 est 	 	thing	would	be	is	if	you	could	 diagnos 	 e 	 	the	disease	early	,	and	prevent	the	 on 	 set 	 	of	the	disease	to	a	bad	state	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	same	procedure	,	but	now	 d 	 one 	 	 minimal 	 ly 	 	 invasive 	 ly 	 	,	with	 on 	 ly 	 	three	 hole 	 s 	 	in	the	body	where	they	're	taking	the	heart	and	 simpl 	 y 	 	 inject 	 ing 	 	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	through	a	laparoscopic	procedure	.
there	go	the	 cell 	 s 	 	.
we	do	n't	have	time	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 detail 	 s 	 	,	but	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	that	 work 	 s 	 	too	.
you	can	take	 patient 	 s 	 	who	are	less	sick	,	and	 br 	 ing 	 	them	back	to	an	 al 	 most 	 	 a 	 symptom 	 atic 	 	state	through	that	kind	of	therapy	.
here	's	 an 	 other 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	stem	-	cell	therapy	that	is	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	 clinic 	 al 	 	yet	,	but	i	think	 ver 	 y 	 	soon	will	be	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	work	of	kacey	marra	from	pittsburgh	,	 a 	 long 	 	with	a	number	of	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	around	the	world	.
they	've	 decide 	 d 	 	that	 liposu 	 ction 	 	fluid	,	which	--	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	we	have	a	lot	of	 liposu 	 ction 	 	fluid	.
it	's	a	great	source	of	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	.
stem	 cell 	 s 	 	are	 pack 	 ed 	 	in	that	 liposu 	 ction 	 	fluid	.
so	you	could	go	in	,	you	could	get	your	tummy	-	tuck	.
out	 come 	 s 	 	the	 liposu 	 ction 	 	fluid	,	and	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	the	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	are	 isolate 	 d 	 	and	 turn 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 neuro 	 ns 	 	.
all	 d 	 one 	 	in	the	lab	.
and	i	think	 fair 	 ly 	 	soon	,	you	will	see	 patient 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 treat 	 ed 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	own	fat	-	derived	,	or	adipose	-	derived	,	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	.
i	 talk 	 ed 	 	before	about	the	use	of	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	to	 dramat 	 ically 	 	change	the	way	we	treat	disease	.
here	's	just	one	 ex 	 ample 	 	before	i	close	up	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 equal 	 ly 	 	tragic	.
we	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 a 	 bid 	 ing 	 	and	 heart 	 break 	 ing 	 	 partner 	 ship 	 	with	our	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	at	the	institute	for	 sur 	 gical 	 	research	in	the	us	 arm 	 y 	 	,	who	have	to	treat	the	now	11,000	 kid 	 s 	 	that	have	come	back	from	 ir 	 aq 	 	.
 man 	 y 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 patient 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 severe 	 ly 	 	 burn 	 ed 	 	.
and	if	there	's	 any 	 thing 	 	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	about	burn	,	it	's	that	we	do	n't	know	how	to	treat	it	.
 every 	 thing 	 	that	is	 d 	 one 	 	to	treat	burn	--	 bas 	 ically 	 	we	do	a	 s 	 odd 	 ing 	 	approach	.
we	make	 some 	 thing 	 	over	here	,	and	then	we	transplant	it	onto	the	 s 	 ite 	 	of	the	wound	,	and	we	try	and	get	the	two	to	take	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	here	,	a	new	,	 wear 	 able 	 	bio	-	reactor	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	designed	--	it	should	be	tested	 clinic 	 ally 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	at	isr	--	by	joerg	gerlach	in	pittsburgh	.
and	that	bio	-	reactor	will	lay	down	in	the	wound	bed	.
the	gun	that	you	see	there	 spray 	 s 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	.
that	's	going	to	spray	 cell 	 s 	 	over	that	area	.
the	reactor	will	serve	to	 fertil 	 ize 	 	the	environment	,	deliver	other	 thing 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	at	the	same	time	,	and	 there 	 fore 	 	we	will	seed	that	lawn	,	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	try	the	 s 	 odd 	 ing 	 	approach	.
it	's	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	way	of	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
so	my	18	 minute 	 s 	 	is	up	.
so	let	me	finish	up	with	some	good	news	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	a	little	bit	of	bad	news	.
the	good	news	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	work	.
 clear 	 ly 	 	the	 image 	 s 	 	kind	of	get	that	 a 	 cross 	 	.
it	's	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	difficult	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 high 	 ly 	 	inter	-	disciplinary	.
 al 	 most 	 	every	field	of	science	 engineer 	 ing 	 	and	 clinic 	 al 	 	practice	is	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	 th 	 is 	 	to	happen	.
a	number	of	 government 	 s 	 	,	and	a	number	of	 region 	 s 	 	,	have	 recogn 	 ized 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	new	way	to	treat	disease	.
the	japanese	government	 we 	 re 	 	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	the	first	,	when	they	 decide 	 d 	 	to	invest	first	3	billion	,	 lat 	 er 	 	 an 	 other 	 	2	billion	in	 th 	 is 	 	field	.
it	's	no	 co 	 incidence 	 	.
japan	is	the	 old 	 est 	 	country	on	earth	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 it 	 s 	 	average	age	.
they	need	 th 	 is 	 	to	work	or	 the 	 ir 	 	health	system	dies	.
so	they	're	 put 	 ting 	 	a	lot	of	 strat 	 egic 	 	 invest 	 ment 	 	focused	in	 th 	 is 	 	area	.
the	european	 un 	 ion 	 	,	same	thing	.
 chin 	 a 	 	,	the	same	thing	.	 chin 	 a 	 	just	 launch 	 ed 	 	a	national	tissue	-	 engineer 	 ing 	 	center	.
the	first	year	budget	was	250	million	us	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	we	've	had	a	 some 	 what 	 	different	approach	.	oh	,	for	al	gore	to	come	and	be	in	the	real	world	 a 	 s 	 	 p 	 resident 	 	.
we	've	had	a	different	approach	.
and	the	approach	 ha 	 s 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	 be 	 en 	 	to	just	sort	of	fund	 thing 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	come	 a 	 long 	 	.
but	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	no	 strat 	 egic 	 	 invest 	 ment 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	all	of	the	 necess 	 ary 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	to	bear	and	focus	them	in	a	 care 	 ful 	 	way	.
and	i	'm	going	to	finish	up	with	a	quote	,	 may 	 be 	 	a	little	cheap	shot	,	at	the	director	of	the	nih	,	who	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 charm 	 ing 	 	man	.
 my 	 self 	 	and	jay	vacanti	from	harvard	went	to	visit	with	him	and	a	number	of	his	 director 	 s 	 	of	his	institute	just	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	ago	,	to	try	and	 con 	 vince 	 	him	that	it	was	time	to	take	just	a	little	piece	of	that	27.5	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	that	he	's	going	to	get	next	year	and	focus	it	,	in	a	 strat 	 egic 	 	way	,	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	we	can	 accele 	 rate 	 	the	pace	at	which	these	 thing 	 s 	 	get	to	 patient 	 s 	 	.
and	at	the	end	of	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 test 	 y 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 	,	what	the	nih	director	 s 	 aid 	 	was	,	``	your	vision	is	 large 	 r 	 	than	our	 appetit 	 e 	 	.	``
i	'd	like	to	close	by	 say 	 ing 	 	that	no	one	's	going	to	change	our	vision	,	but	together	we	can	change	his	 appetit 	 e 	 	.
thank	you	.
