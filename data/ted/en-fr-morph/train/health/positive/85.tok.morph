we	live	in	a	world	that	 every 	 one 	 	 know 	 s 	 	is	 inter 	 dependent 	 	,	but	 in 	 sufficient 	 	in	three	major	ways	.
it	is	,	first	of	all	,	 pro 	 found 	 ly 	 	 un 	 equal 	 	:
half	the	world	's	people	still	living	on	less	than	two	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	day	;
a	billion	people	with	no	access	to	clean	water	;
two	and	a	half	billion	no	access	to	 sanit 	 ation 	 	;
a	billion	going	to	bed	 hung 	 ry 	 	every	night	;
one	in	four	 death 	 s 	 	every	year	from	 aid 	 s 	 	,	tb	,	malaria	and	the	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 infect 	 ions 	 	 associate 	 d 	 	with	 dirt 	 y 	 	water	--	80	percent	of	them	under	five	 year 	 s 	 	of	age	.
even	in	 wealth 	 y 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	it	is	common	now	to	see	 ine 	 quality 	 	growing	.
in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	since	2001	we	've	had	five	 year 	 s 	 	of	economic	growth	,	five	 year 	 s 	 	of	 product 	 ivity 	 	growth	in	the	 work 	 place 	 	,	but	 med 	 ian 	 	 wage 	 s 	 	are	 stag 	 nant 	 	and	the	 percent 	 age 	 	of	 work 	 ing 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	dropping	 be 	 low 	 	the	poverty	line	is	up	by	four	percent	.
the	 percent 	 age 	 	of	 work 	 ing 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	 with 	 out 	 	health	care	up	by	four	percent	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 inter 	 dependent 	 	world	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	to	most	of	us	--	which	is	why	we	're	all	here	in	 north 	 ern 	 	california	 do 	 ing 	 	what	we	do	for	a	living	,	 enjoy 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 even 	 ing 	 	--	is	 pro 	 found 	 ly 	 	 un 	 equal 	 	.
it	is	 al 	 so 	 	 un 	 s 	 table 	 	.
 un 	 s 	 table 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 threat 	 s 	 	of	terror	,	 weapon 	 s 	 	of	mass	 destruct 	 ion 	 	,	the	spread	of	global	disease	and	a	sense	that	we	are	 vulner 	 able 	 	to	it	in	a	way	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	n't	not	so	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	most	 import 	 ant 	 	of	all	,	it	is	 un 	 sustain 	 able 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	climate	change	,	resource	 deple 	 tion 	 	and	species	 destruct 	 ion 	 	.
when	i	think	about	the	world	i	would	like	to	 leav 	 e 	 	to	my	daughter	and	the	 grand 	 children 	 	i	hope	to	have	,	it	is	a	world	that	 move 	 s 	 	away	from	 un 	 equal 	 	,	 un 	 s 	 table 	 	,	 un 	 sustain 	 able 	 	 inter 	 depend 	 ence 	 	to	 integrate 	 d 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	--	 local 	 ly 	 	,	 national 	 ly 	 	and	 global 	 ly 	 	--	that	share	the	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	of	all	 success 	 ful 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	:

when	the	terrorist	 incident 	 s 	 	 occur 	 red 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 king 	 dom 	 	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	think	even	 th 	 ough 	 	they	did	n't	claim	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 live 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	lost	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	on	9/11	,	i	think	the	thing	that	 trouble 	 d 	 	the	british	most	was	that	the	 perpet 	 rator 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	not	 invad 	 ers 	 	,	but	 home 	 grown 	 	 citizen 	 s 	 	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	religious	and	 politic 	 al 	 	 ident 	 ities 	 	 we 	 re 	 	more	 import 	 ant 	 	to	them	than	the	people	they	grew	up	with	,	went	to	school	with	,	 work 	 ed 	 	with	,	 share 	 d 	 	 week 	 end 	 s 	 	with	,	 share 	 d 	 	 meal 	 s 	 	with	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	they	thought	 the 	 ir 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	more	 import 	 ant 	 	than	 the 	 ir 	 	common	 human 	 ity 	 	.
it	is	the	central	 psycho 	 logical 	 	plague	of	 human 	 kind 	 	in	the	21st	century	.
 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	mix	,	people	like	us	,	who	are	not	in	public	 off 	 ice 	 	,	have	more	power	to	do	good	than	at	any	time	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	more	than	half	the	world	's	people	live	under	 government 	 s 	 	they	 vot 	 ed 	 	in	and	can	vote	out	.
and	even	non	-	 democrat 	 ic 	 	 government 	 s 	 	are	more	sensitive	to	public	opinion	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 prim 	 arily 	 	of	the	power	of	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	people	of	modest	 mean 	 s 	 	can	band	together	and	 a 	 mass 	 	vast	 sum 	 s 	 	of	money	that	can	change	the	world	for	some	public	good	if	they	all	agree	.
when	the	tsunami	hit	south	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	,	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 con 	 tribute 	 d 	 	1.2	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	.

when	i	 be 	 came 	 	 p 	 resident 	 	in	1993	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	 non 	 e 	 	of	these	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	in	russia	.

when	i	 organize 	 d 	 	my	 found 	 ation 	 	,	and	i	thought	about	the	world	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	and	the	world	that	i	hope	to	 leav 	 e 	 	to	the	next	generation	,	and	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	be	realistic	about	what	i	had	 car 	 ed 	 	about	all	my	life	that	i	could	still	have	an	impact	on	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	focus	on	 activ 	 ities 	 	that	would	help	to	 allevi 	 ate 	 	poverty	,	fight	disease	,	combat	climate	change	,	bridge	the	religious	,	racial	and	other	 divide 	 s 	 	that	 tor 	 ment 	 	the	world	,	but	to	do	it	in	a	way	that	would	either	use	 what 	 ever 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	we	could	put	together	in	our	group	to	change	the	way	some	public	good	function	was	 perform 	 ed 	 	so	that	it	would	 s 	 weep 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	world	more	.
you	saw	one	 re 	 ference 	 	to	that	in	what	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	do	with	 aid 	 s 	 	 drug 	 s 	 	.
and	i	want	to	say	that	the	head	of	our	 aid 	 s 	 	effort	,	and	the	person	who	 al 	 so 	 	is	 prim 	 arily 	 	active	in	the	wish	i	'll	make	 to 	 night 	 	,	ira	magaziner	,	is	here	with	me	and	i	want	to	thank	him	for	 every 	 thing 	 	he	's	 d 	 one 	 	.
he	's	over	there	.
when	i	got	out	of	 off 	 ice 	 	and	was	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	work	,	first	in	the	caribbean	,	to	try	to	help	deal	with	the	 aid 	 s 	 	crisis	,	generic	 drug 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	for	about	500	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	person	a	year	.
if	you	 b 	 ought 	 	them	in	vast	 bulk 	 s 	 	,	you	could	get	them	at	a	little	under	400	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
the	first	country	we	went	to	work	in	,	the	bahamas	,	was	 pay 	 ing 	 	3,500	 dollar 	 s 	 	for	these	 drug 	 s 	 	.
the	market	was	so	 terr 	 ibly 	 	 dis 	 organize 	 d 	 	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	 buy 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	medicine	through	two	 agent 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	 gig 	 ging 	 	them	 seven 	 fold 	 	.
so	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	week	we	 we 	 re 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	,	we	got	the	price	down	to	500	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
and	all	of	a	sudden	,	they	could	 s 	 ave 	 	seven	 time 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 live 	 s 	 	for	the	same	amount	of	money	.
then	we	went	to	work	with	the	 manufactur 	 ers 	 	of	 aid 	 s 	 	 medicine 	 s 	 	,	one	of	whom	was	 cit 	 ed 	 	in	the	film	,	and	 negoti 	 ated 	 	a	whole	different	change	in	business	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	,
 be 	 cause 	 	even	at	500	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	these	 drug 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 old 	 	on	a	high	-	margin	,	low	-	volume	,	 un 	 certain 	 	-	payment	 bas 	 is 	 	.
so	we	 work 	 ed 	 	on	 improv 	 ing 	 	the	 product 	 ivity 	 	of	the	 operation 	 s 	 	and	the	supply	chain	,	and	went	to	a	low	-	margin	,	high	-	volume	,	 absolute 	 ly 	 	certain	-	payment	business	.
i	 jok 	 ed 	 	that	the	main	 con 	 trib 	 ution 	 	we	made	to	the	battle	against	 aid 	 s 	 	was	to	get	the	 manufactur 	 ers 	 	to	change	from	a	 jewel 	 ry 	 	store	to	a	 grocer 	 y 	 	store	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	.
but	the	price	went	to	140	 dollar 	 s 	 	from	500	.
and	 pre 	 tty 	 	soon	,	the	average	price	was	192	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
now	we	can	get	it	for	about	100	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
children	's	medicine	was	600	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 no 	 body 	 	could	afford	to	buy	any	of	it	.
we	 negoti 	 ated 	 	it	down	to	190	.
then	,	the	french	 impose 	 d 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 brilli 	 ant 	 ly 	 	 conceiv 	 ed 	 	 air 	 line 	 	tax	to	create	a	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	unitaid	,	got	a	bunch	of	other	 count 	 ries 	 	to	help	.
that	children	's	medicine	is	now	60	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	person	a	year	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	that	is	 keep 	 ing 	 	us	from	 bas 	 ically 	 	saving	the	 live 	 s 	 	of	 every 	 body 	 	who	 need 	 s 	 	the	medicine	to	stay	 al 	 ive 	 	are	the	 ab 	 s 	 ence 	 	of	 system 	 s 	 	 necess 	 ary 	 	to	 diagnos 	 e 	 	,	treat	and	care	for	people	and	deliver	 th 	 is 	 	medicine	.
we	 start 	 ed 	 	a	 child 	 hood 	 	 obes 	 ity 	 	 initi 	 ative 	 	with	the	heart	 associ 	 ation 	 	in	america	.
we	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	do	the	same	thing	by	 negoti 	 ating 	 	industry	-	right	 deal 	 s 	 	with	the	soft	drink	and	the	snack	food	industry	to	cut	the	caloric	and	other	 danger 	 ous 	 	content	of	food	going	to	our	children	in	the	 school 	 s 	 	.
we	just	 re 	 organize 	 d 	 	the	 market 	 s 	 	.
and	it	 occur 	 red 	 	to	me	that	in	 th 	 is 	 	whole	non	-	 government 	 al 	 	world	,	 some 	 body 	 	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 organ 	 izing 	 	public	 good 	 s 	 	 market 	 s 	 	.
and	that	is	now	what	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	,	and	 work 	 ing 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	large	cities	group	to	fight	climate	change	,	to	 negoti 	 ate 	 	huge	,	big	,	volume	 deal 	 s 	 	that	will	 en 	 able 	 	cities	which	generate	75	percent	of	the	world	's	 green 	 house 	 	 gas 	 es 	 	,	to	 drastic 	 ally 	 	and	 quick 	 ly 	 	 reduc 	 e 	 	 green 	 house 	 	gas	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	in	a	way	that	is	good	 economic 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	whole	 discuss 	 ion 	 	 a 	 s 	 	if	it	's	some	sort	of	economic	burden	,	is	a	 myster 	 y 	 	to	me	.
i	think	it	's	a	bird	's	nest	on	the	ground	.
when	al	gore	won	his	well	-	 deserve 	 d 	 	oscar	for	the	``	 in 	 convenient 	 	truth	``	movie	,	i	was	 thrill 	 ed 	 	,	but	i	had	 urge 	 d 	 	him	to	make	a	second	movie	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	saw	``	an	 in 	 convenient 	 	truth	,	``	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	slide	in	the	gore	 lectur 	 e 	 	is	the	last	one	,	which	 show 	 s 	 	here	's	where	 green 	 house 	 	 gas 	 es 	 	are	going	if	we	do	n't	do	 any 	 thing 	 	,	here	's	where	they	could	go	.
and	then	there	are	six	different	 categor 	 ies 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	we	can	do	to	change	the	 tra 	 ject 	 ory 	 	.
we	need	a	movie	on	 t 	 hose 	 	six	 categor 	 ies 	 	.
and	all	of	you	need	to	have	it	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	in	your	 brain 	 s 	 	and	to	organize	 your 	 s 	 elves 	 	around	it	.
so	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	that	.
so	 organ 	 izing 	 	these	 market 	 s 	 	is	one	thing	we	try	to	do	.
now	we	have	taken	on	a	second	thing	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 get 	 s 	 	to	my	wish	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	my	experience	in	 work 	 ing 	 	in	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	that	while	the	 head 	 lines 	 	may	all	be	--	the	 pessim 	 istic 	 	 head 	 lines 	 	may	say	,	well	,	we	ca	n't	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	that	or	the	other	thing	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	--	i	think	 incapacit 	 y 	 	is	a	far	 big 	 ger 	 	problem	in	poor	 count 	 ries 	 	than	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	,	and	 feed 	 s 	 	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	.
we	now	have	the	money	,	 give 	 n 	 	these	low	 price 	 s 	 	,	to	 distribut 	 e 	 	 aid 	 s 	 	 drug 	 s 	 	all	over	the	world	to	people	we	can	not	 present 	 ly 	 	reach	.
 to 	 day 	 	these	low	 price 	 s 	 	are	 avail 	 able 	 	in	the	25	 count 	 ries 	 	where	we	work	,	and	in	a	total	of	62	 count 	 ries 	 	,
and	about	550,000	people	are	 get 	 ting 	 	the	 benefit 	 s 	 	of	them	.
but	the	money	is	there	to	reach	 other 	 s 	 	.	the	 system 	 s 	 	are	not	there	to	reach	the	people	.
so	what	we	have	 be 	 en 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	,	 work 	 ing 	 	first	in	rwanda	and	then	in	malawi	and	other	 place 	 s 	 	--	but	i	want	to	talk	about	rwanda	 to 	 night 	 	--	is	to	develop	a	model	for	 r 	 ural 	 	health	care	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	poor	area	that	can	be	used	to	deal	with	 aid 	 s 	 	,	tb	,	malaria	,	other	 infect 	 ious 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	,	 ma 	 ternal 	 	and	child	health	,	and	a	whole	range	of	health	 issue 	 s 	 	poor	people	are	 grappl 	 ing 	 	with	in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	,	that	can	first	be	 scale 	 d 	 	for	the	whole	nation	of	rwanda	,	and	then	will	be	a	model	that	could	 liter 	 ally 	 
be	 implement 	 ed 	 	in	any	other	poor	country	in	the	world	.
and	the	test	is	:	one	,	will	it	do	the	job	?	will	it	provide	high	quality	care	?
and	two	,	will	it	do	it	at	a	price	that	will	 en 	 able 	 	the	country	to	sustain	a	health	care	system	 with 	 out 	 	foreign	 donor 	 s 	 	after	five	to	10	 year 	 s 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	the	 long 	 er 	 	i	deal	with	these	 problem 	 s 	 	,	the	more	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	i	am	that	we	have	to	--	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	 economic 	 s 	 	,	health	,	education	,	 what 	 ever 	 	--	we	have	to	build	 system 	 s 	 	.
and	the	 ab 	 s 	 ence 	 	of	 system 	 s 	 	that	function	break	the	 connect 	 ion 	 	which	got	you	all	in	 th 	 is 	 	seat	 to 	 night 	 	.
you	think	about	 what 	 ever 	 	your	life	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	,	 how 	 ever 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 obstacle 	 s 	 	you	have	 face 	 d 	 	in	your	life	,	at	critical	 juncture 	 s 	 	you	 al 	 ways 	 	 k 	 new 	 	there	was	a	 predict 	 able 	 	 connect 	 ion 	 	between	the	effort	you	 exert 	 ed 	 	and	the	result	you	 achiev 	 ed 	 	.
in	a	world	with	no	 system 	 s 	 	,	with	 cha 	 os 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	guerilla	struggle	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 predict 	 ability 	 	is	not	there	.
and	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 al 	 most 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	to	 s 	 ave 	 	 live 	 s 	 	,	 educ 	 ate 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	,	develop	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	,	 what 	 ever 	 	.
the	person	,	in	my	view	,	who	 ha 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	the	best	job	of	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	health	care	area	,	of	building	a	system	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	poor	area	,	is	dr.	paul	 farm 	 er 	 	,	who	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	know	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	for	now	20	 year 	 s 	 	with	his	group	,	 partner 	 s 	 	in	health	,	 prim 	 arily 	 	in	 ha 	 iti 	 	where	he	 start 	 ed 	 	,
but	they	've	 al 	 so 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	in	russia	,	in	peru	and	other	 place 	 s 	 	around	the	world	.
 a 	 s 	 	poor	 a 	 s 	 	 ha 	 iti 	 	is	,	in	the	area	where	 farm 	 er 	 	's	clinic	is	active	--	and	they	serve	a	 catch 	 ment 	 	area	far	 great 	 er 	 	than	the	medical	 professional 	 s 	 	they	have	would	 indic 	 ate 	 	they	could	serve	--	since	1988	,	they	have	not	lost	one	person	to	 tube 	 rculosis 	 	,	not	one	.
and	they	've	 achiev 	 ed 	 	a	lot	of	other	 amaz 	 ing 	 	health	 result 	 s 	 	.
so	when	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	work	in	rwanda	on	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 dramat 	 ically 	 	 in 	 crease 	 	the	income	of	the	country	and	fight	the	 aid 	 s 	 	problem	,	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	build	a	 health 	 care 	 	network	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	had	 be 	 en 	 	 total 	 ly 	 	 destroy 	 ed 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	genocide	in	1994	,	and	the	per	capita	income	was	still	under	a	dollar	a	day	.
so	i	rang	up	,	 ask 	 ed 	 	paul	 farm 	 er 	 	if	he	would	help	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	me	if	we	could	prove	there	was	a	model	in	 ha 	 iti 	 	and	a	model	in	rwanda	that	we	could	then	take	all	over	the	country	,	number	one	,	it	would	be	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	thing	for	a	country	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 suffer 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	any	on	earth	in	the	last	15	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	number	two	,	we	would	have	 some 	 thing 	 	that	could	then	be	 adapt 	 ed 	 	to	any	other	poor	country	 any 	 where 	 	in	the	world	.
and	so	we	have	set	about	 do 	 ing 	 	that	.
now	,	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	together	18	 month 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	in	an	area	 call 	 ed 	 	southern	kayonza	,	which	is	one	of	the	 poor 	 est 	 	 area 	 s 	 	in	rwanda	,	with	a	group	that	 original 	 ly 	 	 include 	 s 	 	about	400,000	people	.
we	're	 essential 	 ly 	 	 implement 	 ing 	 	what	paul	 farm 	 er 	 	did	in	 ha 	 iti 	 	:	he	 develop 	 s 	 	and	 train 	 s 	 	paid	community	health	 work 	 ers 	 	who	are	able	to	identify	health	 problem 	 s 	 	,	ensure	that	people	who	have	 aid 	 s 	 	or	tb	are	 proper 	 ly 	 	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	and	take	 the 	 ir 	 	medicine	 regular 	 ly 	 	,	who	work	on	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	about	health	education	,	clean	water	and	 sanit 	 ation 	 	,	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	 nutrition 	 al 	 	 supplement 	 s 	 	and	moving	people	up	the	chain	of	health	care	if	they	have	 problem 	 s 	 	of	the	 s 	 ever 	 ity 	 	that	 requir 	 e 	 	it	.
the	 procedure 	 s 	 	that	make	 th 	 is 	 	work	have	 be 	 en 	 	 perfect 	 ed 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	by	paul	 farm 	 er 	 	and	his	team	in	 the 	 ir 	 	work	in	 r 	 ural 	 	 ha 	 iti 	 	over	the	last	20	 year 	 s 	 	.
 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	we	did	an	 evalu 	 ation 	 	of	the	first	18	 month 	 s 	 	of	our	 effort 	 s 	 	in	rwanda	.
and	the	 result 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	so	good	that	the	rwandan	government	 ha 	 s 	 	now	 agree 	 d 	 	to	adopt	the	model	for	the	entire	country	,	and	 ha 	 s 	 	 strong 	 ly 	 	 support 	 ed 	 	and	put	the	full	 resource 	 s 	 	of	the	government	 be 	 hind 	 	it	.
i	'll	tell	you	a	little	bit	about	our	team	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 indic 	 ative 	 	of	what	we	do	.
we	have	about	500	people	around	the	world	 work 	 ing 	 	in	our	 aid 	 s 	 	program	,	some	of	them	for	 noth 	 ing 	 	--	just	for	 transport 	 ation 	 	,	room	and	board	.
and	then	we	have	 other 	 s 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	in	these	other	related	 program 	 s 	 	.
our	business	plan	in	rwanda	was	put	together	under	the	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	of	diana	noble	,	who	is	an	 un 	 usual 	 ly 	 	 gift 	 ed 	 	woman	,	but	not	 un 	 usual 	 	in	the	type	of	people	who	have	 be 	 en 	 	 will 	 ing 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	work	.
she	was	the	 young 	 est 	 	partner	at	schroder	 venture 	 s 	 	in	london	in	her	20s	.
she	was	ceo	of	a	 success 	 ful 	 	 e 	 - 	 venture 	 	--	she	 start 	 ed 	 	and	built	 re 	 ed 	 	elsevier	 venture 	 s 	 	--	and	at	45	she	 decide 	 d 	 	she	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	different	with	her	life	.
so	she	now	 work 	 s 	 	full	-	time	on	 th 	 is 	 	for	 ver 	 y 	 	little	pay	.
she	and	her	team	of	 form 	 er 	 	business	people	have	 create 	 d 	 	a	business	plan	that	will	 en 	 able 	 	us	to	scale	 th 	 is 	 	health	system	up	for	the	whole	country	.
and	it	would	be	worthy	of	the	kind	of	private	 equ 	 ity 	 	work	she	used	to	do	when	she	was	making	a	lot	more	money	for	it	.
when	we	came	to	 th 	 is 	 	 r 	 ural 	 	area	,	45	percent	of	the	children	under	the	age	of	five	had	 stunt 	 ed 	 	growth	due	to	 mal 	 nutrition 	 	.
23	percent	of	them	 di 	 ed 	 	before	they	 reach 	 ed 	 	the	age	of	five	.
 mortal 	 ity 	 	at	birth	was	over	two	-	and	-	a	-	half	percent	.
over	15	percent	of	the	 death 	 s 	 	among	 adult 	 s 	 	and	children	 occur 	 red 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	intestinal	 parasit 	 es 	 	and	 dia 	 rrhea 	 	from	 dirt 	 y 	 	water	and	 in 	 ad 	 equate 	 	 sanit 	 ation 	 	--	all	 entire 	 ly 	 	 prevent 	 able 	 	and	 treat 	 able 	 	.
over	13	percent	of	the	 death 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	from	 respirator 	 y 	 	 ill 	 ness 	 es 	 	--	 aga 	 in 	 	,	all	 prevent 	 able 	 	and	 treat 	 able 	 	.
and	not	a	single	soul	in	 th 	 is 	 	area	was	 be 	 ing 	 	 treat 	 ed 	 	for	 aid 	 s 	 	or	 tube 	 rculosis 	 	.
 with 	 in 	 	the	first	18	 month 	 s 	 	,	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	:	we	went	from	zero	to	about	2,000	people	 be 	 ing 	 	 treat 	 ed 	 	for	 aid 	 s 	 	.
that	's	80	percent	of	the	people	who	need	 treat 	 ment 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	area	.
listen	to	 th 	 is 	 	:	less	than	four	-	 tenth 	 s 	 	of	one	percent	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 treat 	 ed 	 	 stop 	 ped 	 	taking	 the 	 ir 	 	medicine	or	 other 	 wise 	 	 default 	 ed 	 	on	 treat 	 ment 	 	.
that	's	lower	than	the	figure	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
less	than	three	-	 tenth 	 s 	 	of	one	percent	had	to	transfer	to	the	more	expensive	second	-	line	 drug 	 s 	 	.
400,000	 pregn 	 ant 	 	women	 we 	 re 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 counsel 	 ing 	 	and	will	give	birth	for	the	first	time	 with 	 in 	 	an	 organize 	 d 	 	 health 	 care 	 	system	.
that	's	about	43	percent	of	all	the	 pregn 	 ancies 	 	.
about	40	percent	of	all	the	people	--	i	 s 	 aid 	 	400,000	.	i	 me 	 ant 	 	40,000	.
about	40	percent	of	all	the	people	who	need	tb	 treat 	 ment 	 	are	now	 get 	 ting 	 	it	--	in	just	18	 month 	 s 	 	,	up	from	zero	when	we	 start 	 ed 	 	.
43	percent	of	the	children	in	need	of	an	infant	 feed 	 ing 	 	program	to	prevent	 mal 	 nutrition 	 	and	early	death	are	now	 get 	 ting 	 	the	food	 supplement 	 s 	 	they	need	to	stay	 al 	 ive 	 	and	to	grow	.
we	've	 start 	 ed 	 	the	first	malaria	 treat 	 ment 	 	 program 	 s 	 	they	've	ever	had	there	.
 patient 	 s 	 	admitted	to	a	hospital	that	was	 destroy 	 ed 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	genocide	that	we	have	 renovate 	 d 	 	 a 	 long 	 	with	four	other	 clinic 	 s 	 	,	complete	with	solar	power	 gene 	 rator 	 s 	 	,	good	lab	technology	.
we	now	are	 treat 	 ing 	 	325	people	a	month	,	 de 	 spite 	 	the	fact	that	 al 	 most 	 	100	percent	of	the	 aid 	 s 	 	 patient 	 s 	 	are	now	 treat 	 ed 	 	at	home	.
and	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	is	 be 	 cause 	 	we	've	 implement 	 ed 	 	paul	 farm 	 er 	 	's	model	,	using	community	health	 work 	 ers 	 	,	we	estimate	that	 th 	 is 	 	system	could	be	put	 in 	 to 	 	place	for	all	of	rwanda	for	between	five	and	six	percent	of	gdp	,	and	that	the	government	could	sustain	that	 with 	 out 	 	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	foreign	aid	after	five	or	six	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	understand	 health 	 care 	 	 economic 	 s 	 	you	know	that	all	 wealth 	 y 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	 s 	 pend 	 	between	nine	and	11	percent	of	gdp	on	health	care	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	we	 s 	 pend 	 	16	--	but	that	's	a	story	for	 an 	 other 	 	day	.
we	're	now	 work 	 ing 	 	with	 partner 	 s 	 	in	health	and	the	 mini 	 stry 	 	of	health	in	rwanda	and	our	 found 	 ation 	 	 folk 	 s 	 	to	scale	 th 	 is 	 	system	up	.
we	're	 al 	 so 	 	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	in	malawi	and	lesotho	.
and	we	have	similar	 project 	 s 	 	in	tanzania	,	mozambique	,	kenya	and	ethiopia	with	other	 partner 	 s 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	the	same	thing	:	to	 s 	 ave 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 live 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	can	,	but	to	do	it	in	a	 system 	 atic 	 	way	that	can	be	 implement 	 ed 	 	 nation 	 wide 	 	and	then	with	a	model	that	can	be	 implement 	 ed 	 	in	any	country	in	the	world	.
we	need	 initi 	 al 	 	 up 	 front 	 	 invest 	 ment 	 	to	train	 doctor 	 s 	 	,	 nurse 	 s 	 	,	health	 administr 	 ation 	 	and	community	health	 work 	 ers 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	country	,	to	set	up	the	information	technology	,	the	solar	energy	,	the	water	and	 sanit 	 ation 	 	,	the	 transport 	 ation 	 	 infra 	 structure 	 	.
but	over	a	five	-	to	10	-	year	period	,	we	will	take	down	the	need	for	 out 	 side 	 	 assist 	 ance 	 	and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	it	will	be	 phase 	 d 	 	out	.
my	wish	is	that	ted	assist	us	in	our	work	and	help	us	to	build	a	high	-	quality	 r 	 ural 	 	health	system	in	a	poor	country	,	rwanda	,	that	can	be	a	model	for	africa	,	and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	for	any	poor	country	 any 	 where 	 	in	the	world	.
my	belief	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	will	help	us	to	build	a	more	 integrate 	 d 	 	world	with	more	 partner 	 s 	 	and	 few 	 er 	 	 terrorist 	 s 	 	,	with	more	productive	 citizen 	 s 	 	and	 few 	 er 	 	 hat 	 ers 	 	,	a	place	we	'd	all	want	our	 kid 	 s 	 	and	our	 grand 	 children 	 	to	grow	up	in	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	an	honor	for	me	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	,	to	work	in	rwanda	where	we	 al 	 so 	 	have	a	major	economic	 develop 	 ment 	 	project	in	 partner 	 ship 	 	with	 s 	 ir 	 	tom	hunter	,	the	scottish	 philanthro 	 pist 	 	,	where	last	year	we	,	using	the	same	thing	with	 aid 	 s 	 	 drug 	 s 	 	,	cut	the	cost	of	 fertil 	 izer 	 	and	the	interest	rates	on	 micro 	 credit 	 	 loan 	 s 	 	by	30	percent	and	 achiev 	 ed 	 	three	-	to	four	-	hundred	percent	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	in	crop	 yield 	 s 	 	with	the	 farm 	 ers 	 	.
these	people	have	 be 	 en 	 	through	a	lot	and	 non 	 e 	 	of	us	,	most	of	all	me	,	 help 	 ed 	 	them	when	they	 we 	 re 	 	on	the	 ver 	 ge 	 	of	 destroy 	 ing 	 	each	other	.
we	're	 un 	 do 	 ing 	 	that	now	,	and	they	are	so	over	it	and	so	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	future	.
we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	an	 environment 	 ally 	 	 respons 	 ible 	 	way	.
i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	my	best	to	 con 	 vince 	 	them	not	to	run	the	electric	grid	to	the	35	percent	of	the	people	that	have	no	access	,	but	to	do	it	with	clean	energy	.	to	have	 respons 	 ible 	 	 re 	 forest 	 ation 	 	 project 	 s 	 	,
the	rwandans	,	 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	have	 be 	 en 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	good	,	mr.	wilson	,	in	 pre 	 serv 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 top 	 s 	 oil 	 	.
there	's	a	couple	of	 guy 	 s 	 	from	southern	 farm 	 ing 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	--	the	first	thing	i	did	when	i	went	out	to	 th 	 is 	 	place	was	to	get	down	on	my	 hand 	 s 	 	and	 knee 	 s 	 	and	dig	in	the	dirt	and	see	what	they	'd	 d 	 one 	 	with	it	.
we	have	a	chance	here	to	prove	that	a	country	that	 al 	 most 	 	 s 	 laughter 	 ed 	 	 it 	 self 	 	out	of	 exist 	 ence 	 	can	practice	 reconcili 	 ation 	 	,	 re 	 organize 	 	 it 	 self 	 	,	focus	on	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	and	provide	 comprehens 	 ive 	 	,	quality	health	care	with	minimal	 out 	 side 	 	help	.
i	am	 grat 	 e 	 ful 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	prize	,	and	i	will	use	it	to	that	end	.
we	could	use	some	more	help	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	think	of	what	it	would	mean	if	we	could	have	a	world	-	class	health	system	in	rwanda	--	in	a	country	with	a	less	-	than	-	one	-	dollar	-	a	-	day	-	per	-	capita	income	,	one	that	could	 s 	 ave 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	 live 	 s 	 	over	the	next	decade	if	 appli 	 ed 	 	to	every	 similar 	 ly 	 	 situ 	 ated 	 	country	on	earth	.
it	's	worth	a	try	and	i	 believ 	 e 	 	it	would	succeed	.
thank	you	and	god	bless	you	.
