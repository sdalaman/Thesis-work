so	it	was	about	four	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	five	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,
i	was	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	on	a	stage	in	philadelphia	,	i	think	it	was	,	with	a	bag	similar	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	i	was	 pull 	 ing 	 	a	molecule	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	bag	.
and	i	was	 say 	 ing 	 	,	you	do	n't	know	 th 	 is 	 	molecule	 re 	 ally 	 	well	,
but	your	body	 know 	 s 	 	it	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	well	.
and	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	that	your	body	 hat 	 ed 	 	it	,	at	the	time	,
 be 	 cause 	 	we	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 immun 	 e 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	alpha	-	gal	epitope	.
and	the	fact	that	pig	heart	 val 	 ves 	 	have	 lot 	 s 	 	of	these	on	them	is	the	reason	that	you	ca	n't	transplant	a	pig	heart	 val 	 ve 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	person	 eas 	 ily 	 	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	our	body	 do 	 es 	 	n't	hate	these	.
our	body	 love 	 s 	 	these	.	it	eats	them	.
i	mean	,	the	 cell 	 s 	 	in	our	 immun 	 e 	 	system	are	 al 	 ways 	 	 hung 	 ry 	 	.
and	if	an	 anti 	 body 	 	is	 s 	 tuck 	 	to	one	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	on	the	cell	,	it	 mean 	 s 	 	``	that	's	food	.	``
now	,	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	about	that	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	you	know	,	we	've	got	 th 	 is 	 	 immun 	 e 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	molecule	that	we	do	n't	make	,	and	we	see	it	a	lot	in	other	 animal 	 s 	 	and	stuff	.
but	i	 s 	 aid 	 	we	ca	n't	get	rid	of	it	,
 be 	 cause 	 	all	the	people	who	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	transplant	heart	 val 	 ves 	 	found	out	you	ca	n't	get	rid	of	that	 immun 	 ity 	 	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	why	do	n't	you	use	that	?
what	if	i	could	stick	 th 	 is 	 	molecule	,	 s 	 lap 	 	it	onto	a	bacteria	that	was	 pathogen 	 ic 	 	to	me	,	that	had	just	 invad 	 ed 	 	my	 lung 	 s 	 	?
i	mean	i	could	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	tap	 in 	 to 	 	an	 immun 	 e 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	that	was	 al 	 ready 	 	there	,
where	it	was	not	going	to	take	five	or	six	 day 	 s 	 	to	develop	it	--
it	was	going	to	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	attack	 what 	 ever 	 	 th 	 is 	 	thing	was	on	.
it	was	kind	of	like	the	same	thing	that	 happen 	 s 	 	when	you	,	like	when	you	're	 get 	 ting 	 	 stop 	 ped 	 	for	a	traffic	ticket	in	l.a.	,	and	the	cop	 drop 	 s 	 	a	bag	of	 mar 	 ijuana 	 	in	the	back	of	your	car	,	and	then	 charge 	 s 	 	you	for	 possess 	 ion 	 	of	 mar 	 ijuana 	 	.
it	's	like	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	fast	,	 ver 	 y 	 	efficient	way	to	get	people	off	the	street	.
so	you	can	take	a	bacteria	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	these	 thing 	 s 	 	at	all	,	and	if	you	could	 clam 	 p 	 	these	on	it	 re 	 ally 	 	well	you	have	it	taken	off	the	street	.
and	for	certain	bacteria	we	do	n't	have	 re 	 ally 	 	efficient	ways	to	do	that	 any 	 more 	 	.
our	 anti 	 biotic 	 s 	 	are	running	out	.
and	,	i	mean	,	the	world	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	is	running	out	too	.
so	 prob 	 ably 	 	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	50	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	--	 strepto 	 coccus 	 	and	stuff	like	that	will	be	 ramp 	 ant 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	we	wo	n't	be	here	.	but	if	we	are	--	we	're	going	to	need	 some 	 thing 	 	to	do	with	the	bacteria	.
so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	thing	,	with	a	bunch	of	 collabor 	 ators 	 	.
and	 try 	 ing 	 	to	attach	 th 	 is 	 	to	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 attach 	 ed 	 	to	certain	specific	target	 zone 	 s 	 	,	bacteria	that	we	do	n't	like	.
and	i	feel	now	like	george	bush	.
it	's	like	``	mission	 accomplish 	 ed 	 	.	``
so	i	might	be	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	dumb	,	just	like	he	was	 do 	 ing 	 	at	the	time	.
but	 bas 	 ically 	 	what	i	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	there	we	've	now	gotten	to	work	.
and	it	's	 kill 	 ing 	 	bacteria	.	it	's	eating	them	.
 th 	 is 	 	thing	can	be	 s 	 tuck 	 	,	like	that	little	green	triangle	up	there	,	sort	of	 symbol 	 izing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	right	now	.
you	can	stick	 th 	 is 	 	to	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	a	dna	 apt 	 am 	 er 	 	.	and	that	dna	 apt 	 am 	 er 	 	will	attach	 specific 	 ally 	 	to	a	target	that	you	have	 select 	 ed 	 	for	it	.
so	you	can	find	a	little	feature	on	a	 bacter 	 ium 	 	that	you	do	n't	like	,	like	staphylococcus	--	i	do	n't	like	it	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 kill 	 ed 	 	a	professor	friend	of	mine	last	year	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	respond	to	 anti 	 biotic 	 s 	 	.	so	i	do	n't	like	it	.
and	i	'm	making	an	 apt 	 am 	 er 	 	that	will	have	 th 	 is 	 	 attach 	 ed 	 	to	it	.
that	will	know	how	to	find	 s 	 ta 	 ph 	 	when	it	's	in	your	body	,	and	will	alert	your	 immun 	 e 	 	system	to	go	after	it	.
here	's	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	.	see	that	line	on	the	 ver 	 y 	 	top	with	the	little	 dot 	 s 	 	?
that	's	a	bunch	of	 mic 	 e 	 	that	had	 be 	 en 	 	 poison 	 ed 	 	by	our	scientist	 friend 	 s 	 	down	in	texas	,	at	brooks	air	base	,	with	 an 	 thra 	 x 	 	.
and	they	had	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 treat 	 ed 	 	with	a	drug	that	we	made	that	would	attack	 an 	 thra 	 x 	 	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	and	direct	your	 immun 	 e 	 	system	to	it	.
you	'll	notice	they	all	lived	,	the	 one 	 s 	 	on	the	top	line	--
that	's	a	100	percent	 surviv 	 al 	 	rate	.
and	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	lived	 an 	 other 	 	14	 day 	 s 	 	,	or	28	when	we	 final 	 ly 	 	 kill 	 ed 	 	them	,	and	took	them	 a 	 part 	 	and	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	what	went	wrong	.
why	did	they	not	die	?
and	they	did	n't	die	 be 	 cause 	 	they	did	n't	have	 an 	 thra 	 x 	 	 any 	 more 	 	.
so	we	did	it	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
mission	 accomplish 	 ed 	 	!
