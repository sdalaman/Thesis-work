so	 a 	 s 	 	a	fashion	 design 	 er 	 	,	i	've	 al 	 ways 	 	 tend 	 ed 	 	to	think	of	 material 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	or	 th 	 is 	 	,	or	 may 	 be 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	then	i	met	a	biologist	,	and	now	i	think	of	 material 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	--	green	tea	,	sugar	,	a	few	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	and	a	little	time	.
i	'm	 essential 	 ly 	 	using	a	kombucha	recipe	,	which	is	a	 sym 	 biotic 	 	mix	of	bacteria	,	 y 	 east 	 s 	 	and	other	micro	-	 organism 	 s 	 	,	which	spin	 cell 	 u 	 lose 	 	in	a	 ferment 	 ation 	 	process	.
over	time	,	these	 tin 	 y 	 	 th 	 read 	 s 	 	form	in	the	liquid	 in 	 to 	 	 layer 	 s 	 	and	produce	a	mat	on	the	surface	.
so	we	start	by	 brew 	 ing 	 	the	tea	.
i	brew	up	to	about	30	 liter 	 s 	 	of	tea	at	a	time	,	and	then	while	it	's	still	hot	,	add	a	couple	of	 kilo 	 s 	 	of	sugar	.
we	stir	 th 	 is 	 	in	 un 	 til 	 	it	's	 complete 	 ly 	 	 dis 	 solve 	 d 	 	and	then	pour	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	growth	bath	.
we	need	to	check	that	the	temperature	 ha 	 s 	 	 cool 	 ed 	 	to	 be 	 low 	 	30	 degree 	 s 	 	c	.
and	then	we	're	ready	to	add	the	living	organism	.
and	 a 	 long 	 	with	that	,	some	 ace 	 tic 	 	acid	.
and	once	you	get	 th 	 is 	 	process	going	,	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	 re 	 cycle 	 	your	previous	 ferment 	 ed 	 	liquid	.
we	need	to	maintain	an	 optim 	 um 	 	temperature	for	the	growth	.
and	i	use	a	heat	mat	to	 s 	 it 	 	the	bath	on	and	a	 thermo 	 stat 	 	to	 regulat 	 e 	 	it	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	in	hot	weather	,	i	can	just	grow	it	 out 	 side 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	mini	fabric	farm	.
after	about	three	 day 	 s 	 	,	the	 bubble 	 s 	 	will	appear	on	the	surface	of	the	liquid	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 tell 	 ing 	 	us	that	the	 ferment 	 ation 	 	is	in	full	 s 	 wing 	 	.
and	the	bacteria	are	 feed 	 ing 	 	on	the	sugar	 nutrient 	 s 	 	in	the	liquid	.
so	they	're	 s 	 pinning 	 	these	 tin 	 y 	 	nano	 fiber 	 s 	 	of	 pur 	 e 	 	 cell 	 u 	 lose 	 	.
and	they	're	 stick 	 ing 	 	together	,	 form 	 ing 	 	 layer 	 s 	 	and	giving	us	a	sheet	on	the	surface	.
after	about	two	to	three	 week 	 s 	 	,	we	're	looking	at	 some 	 thing 	 	which	is	about	an	inch	in	 thick 	 ness 	 	.
so	the	bath	on	the	left	is	after	five	 day 	 s 	 	,	and	on	the	right	,	after	10	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	static	culture	.
you	do	n't	have	to	do	 any 	 thing 	 	to	it	;	you	just	 liter 	 ally 	 	watch	it	grow	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	need	light	.
and	when	it	's	ready	to	harvest	,	you	take	it	out	of	the	bath	and	you	wash	it	in	cold	,	 soap 	 y 	 	water	.
at	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	heavy	.
it	's	over	90	percent	water	,	so	we	need	to	let	that	 evapo 	 rate 	 	.
so	i	spread	it	out	onto	a	 wood 	 en 	 	sheet	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	you	can	do	that	 out 	 side 	 	and	just	let	it	dry	in	the	air	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	it	's	 dry 	 ing 	 	,	it	's	 compress 	 ing 	 	,	so	what	you	're	left	with	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	the	recipe	,	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	either	like	a	 re 	 ally 	 	light	-	weight	,	 trans 	 parent 	 	paper	,	or	 some 	 thing 	 	which	is	much	more	like	a	 flex 	 ible 	 	 veget 	 able 	 	leather	.
and	then	you	can	either	cut	that	out	and	sew	it	 convention 	 ally 	 	,	or	you	can	use	the	wet	material	to	form	it	around	a	three	-	dimensional	shape	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	it	 evapo 	 rates 	 	,	it	will	knit	 it 	 self 	 	together	,	 form 	 ing 	 	 seam 	 s 	 	.
so	the	color	in	 th 	 is 	 	jacket	is	coming	 pur 	 e 	 ly 	 	from	green	tea	.
i	guess	it	 al 	 so 	 	 look 	 s 	 	a	little	bit	like	human	skin	,	which	 intrigu 	 es 	 	me	.
since	it	's	 organ 	 ic 	 	,	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	keen	to	try	and	 minim 	 ize 	 	the	 add 	 ition 	 	of	any	 chemical 	 s 	 	.
i	can	make	it	change	color	 with 	 out 	 	using	dye	by	a	process	of	iron	 oxid 	 ation 	 	.
using	fruit	and	 veget 	 able 	 	 stain 	 ing 	 	,	create	 organ 	 ic 	 	 pattern 	 ing 	 	.
and	using	 indi 	 go 	 	,	make	it	anti	-	 micro 	 bi 	 al 	 	.
and	in	fact	,	cotton	would	take	up	to	18	 dip 	 s 	 	in	 indi 	 go 	 	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	a	color	 th 	 is 	 	dark	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	super	-	absorbency	of	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 cell 	 u 	 lose 	 	,	it	just	 take 	 s 	 	one	,	and	a	 re 	 ally 	 	short	one	at	that	.
what	i	ca	n't	yet	do	is	make	it	water	-	resistant	.
so	if	i	was	to	walk	 out 	 side 	 	in	the	rain	 wear 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	dress	 to 	 day 	 	,	i	would	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	start	to	absorb	huge	 amount 	 s 	 	of	water	.
the	dress	would	get	 re 	 ally 	 	heavy	,	and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	the	 seam 	 s 	 	would	 prob 	 ably 	 	fall	 a 	 part 	 	--	 leav 	 ing 	 	me	 feel 	 ing 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	naked	.
possibly	a	good	performance	piece	,	but	 definite 	 ly 	 	not	ideal	for	 every 	 day 	 	wear	.
what	i	'm	looking	for	is	a	way	to	give	the	material	the	 qual 	 ities 	 	that	i	need	.
so	what	i	want	to	do	is	say	to	a	future	bug	,	``	spin	me	a	 th 	 read 	 	.
align	it	in	 th 	 is 	 	direction	.
make	it	 hydro 	 phobic 	 	.
and	while	you	're	at	it	,	just	form	it	around	 th 	 is 	 	3d	shape	.	``
bacterial	 cell 	 u 	 lose 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	used	for	wound	 heal 	 ing 	 	,	and	possibly	in	the	future	for	 bio 	 compatible 	 	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	,	possibly	even	 re 	 placement 	 	bone	tissue	.
but	with	synthetic	biology	,	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	imagine	 engineer 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 bacter 	 ium 	 	to	produce	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 give 	 s 	 	us	the	quality	,	 quant 	 ity 	 	and	shape	of	material	that	we	 desir 	 e 	 	.
 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 design 	 er 	 	,	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 
 be 	 cause 	 	then	i	start	to	think	,	 w 	 ow 	 	,	we	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	imagine	growing	 consum 	 able 	 	 product 	 s 	 	.
what	 excit 	 es 	 	me	about	using	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	is	 the 	 ir 	 	efficiency	.
so	we	 on 	 ly 	 	grow	what	we	need	.
there	's	no	waste	.
and	in	fact	,	we	could	make	it	from	a	waste	stream	--	so	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	a	waste	sugar	stream	from	a	food	 process 	 ing 	 	plant	.
 final 	 ly 	 	,	at	the	end	of	use	,	we	could	 bio 	 de 	 grade 	 	it	 natural 	 ly 	 	 a 	 long 	 	with	your	 veget 	 able 	 	 peel 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
what	i	'm	not	 suggest 	 ing 	 	is	that	 micro 	 bi 	 al 	 	 cell 	 u 	 lose 	 	is	going	to	be	a	 re 	 placement 	 	for	cotton	,	leather	or	other	 text 	 ile 	 	 material 	 s 	 	.
but	i	do	think	it	could	be	 quit 	 e 	 	a	smart	and	 sustain 	 able 	 	 add 	 ition 	 	to	our	 increasing 	 ly 	 	precious	natural	 resource 	 s 	 	.
 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	it	wo	n't	even	be	fashion	where	we	see	these	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	have	 the 	 ir 	 	impact	.
we	could	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	imagine	growing	a	lamp	,	a	chair	,	a	car	or	 may 	 be 	 	even	a	house	.
so	i	guess	what	my	question	to	you	is	:	in	the	future	,	what	would	you	 choos 	 e 	 	to	grow	?
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
bruno	giussani	:	suzanne	,	just	a	curiosity	,	what	you	're	 wear 	 ing 	 	is	not	random	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	 jacket 	 s 	 	you	grew	?
sl	:	 y 	 es 	 	,	it	is	.
it	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	--	part	of	the	project	's	still	in	process	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	one	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 bio 	 de 	 grad 	 ing 	 	in	front	of	your	 eye 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 absorb 	 ing 	 	my	sweat	,	and	it	's	 feed 	 ing 	 	on	it	.
bg	:	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	we	'll	let	you	go	and	 s 	 ave 	 	it	,	and	 rescu 	 e 	 	it	.
