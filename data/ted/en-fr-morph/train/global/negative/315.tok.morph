who	are	we	?
that	is	the	big	question	.	and	 essential 	 ly 	 	we	are	just	an	 up 	 right 	 	-	 walk 	 ing 	 	,	big	-	brained	,	super	-	intelligent	ape	.
 th 	 is 	 	could	be	us	.
we	belong	to	the	family	 call 	 ed 	 	the	hominidae	.
we	are	the	species	 call 	 ed 	 	homo	 sapien 	 s 	 	 sapien 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	remember	that	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	our	place	in	the	world	 to 	 day 	 	and	our	future	on	planet	earth	.
we	are	one	species	of	about	five	and	a	half	thousand	 mammal 	 ian 	 	species	that	exist	on	planet	earth	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	that	's	just	a	 tin 	 y 	 	fraction	of	all	species	that	have	ever	lived	on	the	planet	in	past	 time 	 s 	 	.
we	're	one	species	out	of	 approximate 	 ly 	 	,
or	let	's	say	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	16	 up 	 right 	 	-	 walk 	 ing 	 	 ape 	 s 	 	that	have	 exist 	 ed 	 	over	the	past	six	to	eight	million	 year 	 s 	 	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	we	know	,	we	're	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 up 	 right 	 	-	 walk 	 ing 	 	ape	that	 exist 	 s 	 	on	planet	earth	 to 	 day 	 	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	the	 bono 	 bo 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	remember	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 bono 	 bo 	 s 	 	are	so	human	,	and	they	share	99	percent	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 gene 	 s 	 	with	us	.	and	we	share	our	 origin 	 s 	 	with	a	 hand 	 ful 	 	of	the	living	great	 ape 	 s 	 	.	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	remember	that	we	 evolv 	 ed 	 	.	now	,	i	know	that	's	a	 dirt 	 y 	 	word	for	some	people	,	but	we	 evolv 	 ed 	 	from	common	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	with	the	 gorilla 	 s 	 	,	the	chimpanzee	and	 al 	 so 	 	the	 bono 	 bo 	 s 	 	.
we	have	a	common	past	,	and	we	have	a	common	future	.	and	it	is	 import 	 ant 	 	to	remember	that	all	of	these	great	 ape 	 s 	 	have	come	on	 a 	 s 	 	long	and	 a 	 s 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 evolution 	 ary 	 	journey	 a 	 s 	 	we	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	have	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	it	's	 th 	 is 	 	journey	that	is	of	 s 	 uch 	 	interest	to	 human 	 ity 	 	,	and	it	's	 th 	 is 	 	journey	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	the	focus	of	the	past	three	 generation 	 s 	 	of	my	family	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	in	east	africa	looking	for	the	fossil	 remain 	 s 	 	of	our	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	to	try	and	piece	together	our	 evolution 	 ary 	 	past	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	we	look	for	them	.
a	group	of	 dedicate 	 d 	 	young	men	and	women	walk	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	out	 a 	 cross 	 	vast	 area 	 s 	 	of	africa	,	looking	for	small	 fragment 	 s 	 	of	bone	,	fossil	bone	,	that	may	be	on	the	surface	.
and	that	's	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	what	we	may	do	 a 	 s 	 	we	walk	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	in	 north 	 ern 	 	kenya	,	looking	for	 fossil 	 s 	 	.
i	doubt	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	in	the	audience	can	see	the	fossil	that	's	in	 th 	 is 	 	picture	,	but	if	you	look	 ver 	 y 	 	 care 	 fully 	 	,	there	is	a	jaw	,	a	lower	jaw	,	of	a	4.1	-	million	-	year	-	old	 up 	 right 	 	-	 walk 	 ing 	 	ape	 a 	 s 	 	it	was	found	at	lake	turkana	on	the	west	side	.
it	's	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	time	-	 consum 	 ing 	 	,	labor	-	intensive	and	it	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	going	to	involve	a	lot	more	people	,	to	begin	to	piece	together	our	past	.
we	still	 re 	 ally 	 	have	n't	got	a	 ver 	 y 	 	complete	picture	of	it	.
when	we	find	a	fossil	,	we	mark	it	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	we	've	got	great	technology	:	we	have	gps	.
we	mark	it	with	a	gps	fix	,	and	we	 al 	 so 	 	take	a	digital	photograph	of	the	specimen	,	so	we	could	 essential 	 ly 	 	put	it	back	on	the	surface	,	 exact 	 ly 	 	where	we	found	it	.	and	we	can	 br 	 ing 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	information	 in 	 to 	 	big	gis	 package 	 s 	 	,	 to 	 day 	 	.
when	we	then	find	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	like	the	 bone 	 s 	 	of	a	human	 ance 	 s 	 tor 	 	,	we	begin	to	 excav 	 ate 	 	it	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 care 	 fully 	 	and	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	,	using	 dent 	 al 	 	 pick 	 s 	 	and	fine	 paint 	 brush 	 es 	 	.
and	all	the	sediment	is	then	put	through	these	 screen 	 s 	 	,	and	where	we	go	 aga 	 in 	 	through	it	 ver 	 y 	 	 care 	 fully 	 	,	looking	for	small	bone	 fragment 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	then	 wash 	 ed 	 	.
and	these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	so	 excit 	 ing 	 	.	they	are	so	often	the	 on 	 ly 	 	,	or	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	time	that	 any 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	 s 	 een 	 	the	 remain 	 s 	 	.
and	here	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	special	moment	,	when	my	mother	and	 my 	 self 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 dig 	 ging 	 	up	some	 remain 	 s 	 	of	human	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	.	and	it	is	one	of	the	most	special	 thing 	 s 	 	to	ever	do	with	your	mother	.
not	 man 	 y 	 	people	can	say	that	.
but	now	,	let	me	take	you	back	to	africa	,	two	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
i	'd	just	like	to	point	out	,	if	you	look	at	the	map	of	africa	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	look	like	a	hominid	skull	in	 it 	 s 	 	shape	.
now	we	're	going	to	go	to	the	east	african	and	the	rift	 val 	 ley 	 	.
it	 essential 	 ly 	 	 run 	 s 	 	up	from	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	of	aden	,	or	 run 	 s 	 	down	to	lake	malawi	.
and	the	rift	 val 	 ley 	 	is	a	 depress 	 ion 	 	.
it	's	a	basin	,	and	 river 	 s 	 	flow	down	from	the	 high 	 land 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	basin	,	 carry 	 ing 	 	sediment	,	 pre 	 serv 	 ing 	 	the	 bone 	 s 	 	of	 animal 	 s 	 	that	lived	there	.
if	you	want	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	fossil	,	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	need	to	die	 some 	 where 	 	where	your	 bone 	 s 	 	will	be	 rapid 	 ly 	 	buried	.
you	then	hope	that	the	earth	 move 	 s 	 	in	 s 	 uch 	 	a	way	 a 	 s 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	the	 bone 	 s 	 	back	up	to	the	surface	.
and	then	you	hope	that	one	of	us	lot	will	walk	around	and	find	small	 piece 	 s 	 	of	you	.
ok	,	so	it	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	surprising	that	we	know	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	we	do	know	 to 	 day 	 	about	our	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	difficult	,	a	,	for	these	 thing 	 s 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	--	to	be	--	 preserve 	 d 	 	,	and	 second 	 ly 	 	,	for	them	to	have	 be 	 en 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	back	up	to	the	surface	.
and	we	 re 	 ally 	 	have	 on 	 ly 	 	 s 	 pent 	 	50	 year 	 s 	 	looking	for	these	 remain 	 s 	 	,	and	begin	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	piece	together	our	 evolution 	 ary 	 	story	.
so	,	let	's	go	to	lake	turkana	,	which	is	one	 s 	 uch 	 	lake	basin	in	the	 ver 	 y 	 	north	of	our	country	,	kenya	.
and	if	you	look	north	here	,	there	's	a	big	river	that	 flow 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	lake	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	 carry 	 ing 	 	sediment	and	 pre 	 serv 	 ing 	 	the	 remain 	 s 	 	of	the	 animal 	 s 	 	that	lived	there	.
fossil	 s 	 ites 	 	run	up	and	down	both	 length 	 s 	 	of	that	lake	basin	,	which	 represent 	 s 	 	some	20,000	square	 mile 	 s 	 	.
that	's	a	huge	job	that	we	've	got	on	our	 hand 	 s 	 	.
two	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	at	lake	turkana	,	homo	 erect 	 us 	 	,	one	of	our	human	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	lived	in	 th 	 is 	 	region	.
you	can	see	some	of	the	major	fossil	 s 	 ites 	 	that	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	in	the	north	.	but	,	 essential 	 ly 	 	,	two	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	homo	 erect 	 us 	 	,	up	in	the	far	right	corner	,	lived	 a 	 long 	 side 	 	three	other	species	of	human	 ance 	 s 	 tor 	 	.
and	here	is	a	skull	of	a	homo	 erect 	 us 	 	,	which	i	just	 pull 	 ed 	 	off	the	shelf	there	.
but	it	is	not	to	say	that	 be 	 ing 	 	a	single	species	on	planet	earth	is	the	norm	.
in	fact	,	if	you	go	back	in	time	,	it	is	the	norm	that	there	are	 multi 	 ple 	 	species	of	 hominid 	 s 	 	or	of	human	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	that	 co 	 exist 	 	at	any	one	time	.
where	did	these	 thing 	 s 	 	come	from	?
that	's	what	we	're	still	 try 	 ing 	 	to	find	 answer 	 s 	 	to	,	and	it	is	 import 	 ant 	 	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	there	is	 divers 	 ity 	 	in	all	different	species	,	and	our	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	are	no	exception	.
here	's	some	 re 	 construction 	 s 	 	of	some	of	the	 fossil 	 s 	 	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	found	from	lake	turkana	.
but	i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	to	have	 be 	 en 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	up	in	kenya	,	 essential 	 ly 	 	 ac 	 company 	 ing 	 	my	 parent 	 s 	 	to	lake	turkana	in	search	of	human	 remain 	 s 	 	.
and	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	dig	up	,	when	we	got	old	 en 	 ough 	 	,	 fossil 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	a	 s 	 lender 	 	-	snouted	crocodile	.	and	we	 d 	 ug 	 	up	giant	 tortoise 	 s 	 	,	and	 elephant 	 s 	 	and	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	.
but	when	i	was	12	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	was	in	 th 	 is 	 	picture	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 	was	in	place	on	the	west	side	,	when	they	found	 essential 	 ly 	 	the	skeleton	of	 th 	 is 	 	homo	 erect 	 us 	 	.
i	could	 re 	 late 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	homo	 erect 	 us 	 	skeleton	 ver 	 y 	 	well	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	the	same	age	that	he	was	when	he	 di 	 ed 	 	.
and	i	 imagin 	 ed 	 	him	to	be	tall	,	dark	-	 skin 	 ned 	 	.

he	was	 ver 	 y 	 	able	to	use	 stone 	 s 	 	 effective 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	individual	 him 	 self 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	one	that	i	'm	 hold 	 ing 	 	up	here	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	a	bad	back	.	he	'd	 prob 	 ably 	 	had	an	 in 	 jury 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	child	.

 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	for	him	,	he	fell	 in 	 to 	 	a	swamp	and	could	n't	get	out	.
 essential 	 ly 	 	,	his	 bone 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	buried	and	 beaut 	 i 	 fully 	 	 preserve 	 d 	 	.
and	he	 remain 	 ed 	 	there	 un 	 til 	 	1.6	million	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	when	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	famous	fossil	hunter	,	kamoya	kimeu	,	 walk 	 ed 	 	 a 	 long 	 	a	small	 hill 	 side 	 	and	found	that	small	piece	of	his	skull	 ly 	 ing 	 	on	the	surface	 among 	 st 	 	the	 pe 	 bble 	 s 	 	,	 recogn 	 ized 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	hominid	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	little	piece	up	here	on	the	top	.
well	,	an	 excav 	 ation 	 	was	 beg 	 un 	 	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	,	and	more	and	more	little	bits	of	skull	 start 	 ed 	 	to	be	 extra 	 cted 	 	from	the	sediment	.
and	what	was	so	 f 	 un 	 	about	it	was	 th 	 is 	 	:	the	skull	 piece 	 s 	 	got	 close 	 r 	 	and	 close 	 r 	 	to	the	 root 	 s 	 	of	the	tree	,	and	 fair 	 ly 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	the	tree	had	grown	up	,
but	it	had	found	that	the	skull	had	 capture 	 d 	 	nice	water	in	the	 hill 	 side 	 	,	and	so	it	had	 decide 	 d 	 	to	grow	 it 	 s 	 	 root 	 s 	 	in	and	around	 th 	 is 	 	,	 hold 	 ing 	 	it	in	place	and	 prevent 	 ing 	 	it	from	 wash 	 ing 	 	away	down	the	 slop 	 e 	 	.
we	 beg 	 an 	 	to	find	limb	 bone 	 s 	 	;	we	found	finger	 bone 	 s 	 	,	the	 bone 	 s 	 	of	the	 pel 	 vis 	 	,	 vertebra 	 e 	 	,	 rib 	 s 	 	,	the	collar	 bone 	 s 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	that	had	never	,	ever	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 een 	 	before	in	homo	 erect 	 us 	 	.
it	was	 tru 	 ly 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	.
he	had	a	body	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	to	our	own	,	and	he	was	on	the	threshold	of	 be 	 coming 	 	human	.
well	,	 short 	 ly 	 	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	 member 	 s 	 	of	his	species	 start 	 ed 	 	to	move	 north 	 ward 	 s 	 	out	of	africa	,	and	you	start	to	see	 fossil 	 s 	 	of	homo	 erect 	 us 	 	in	georgia	,	 chin 	 a 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	in	 part 	 s 	 	of	indonesia	.
so	,	homo	 erect 	 us 	 	was	the	first	human	 ance 	 s 	 tor 	 	to	 leav 	 e 	 	africa	and	begin	 it 	 s 	 	spread	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 glob 	 e 	 	.

but	they	lived	 on 	 ly 	 	18,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	that	is	 tru 	 ly 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	to	think	about	.
just	to	put	 th 	 is 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 generation 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	people	do	find	it	hard	to	think	of	time	,	homo	 erect 	 us 	 	left	africa	90,000	 generation 	 s 	 	ago	.

the	question	now	is	,	well	,	who	are	we	?
we	're	 certain 	 ly 	 	a	polluting	,	 waste 	 ful 	 	,	 aggress 	 ive 	 	species	,	with	a	few	nice	 thing 	 s 	 	 throw 	 n 	 	in	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	.
for	the	most	part	,	we	're	not	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 pleas 	 ant 	 	at	all	.
we	have	a	much	 large 	 r 	 	brain	than	our	ape	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	.
is	 th 	 is 	 	a	good	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 adapt 	 ation 	 	,	or	is	it	going	to	lead	us	to	 be 	 ing 	 	the	 short 	 est 	 	-	lived	hominid	species	on	planet	earth	?
and	what	is	it	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 make 	 s 	 	us	us	?
i	think	it	's	our	 collect 	 ive 	 	 intellig 	 ence 	 	.
it	's	our	ability	to	write	 thing 	 s 	 	down	,	our	language	and	our	 conscious 	 ness 	 	.
from	 ver 	 y 	 	primitive	 begin 	 ning 	 s 	 	,	with	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 crud 	 e 	 	tool	kit	of	 stone 	 s 	 	,	we	now	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 advance 	 d 	 	tool	kit	,	and	our	tool	use	 ha 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 reach 	 ed 	 	unprecedented	 level 	 s 	 	:

and	we	've	 al 	 so 	 	 manage 	 d 	 	to	communicate	with	people	all	over	the	world	,	from	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 place 	 s 	 	.
even	from	 with 	 in 	 	an	 excav 	 ation 	 	in	 north 	 ern 	 	kenya	,	we	can	talk	to	people	about	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	al	gore	so	 clear 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 re 	 minded 	 	us	,	we	have	 reach 	 ed 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 number 	 s 	 	of	people	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	.
human	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 surviv 	 e 	 	on	planet	earth	,	if	you	look	at	the	fossil	record	,	for	about	,	on	average	,	a	million	 year 	 s 	 	at	a	time	.
we	've	 on 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	around	for	the	past	200,000	 year 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	species	,	yet	we	've	 reach 	 ed 	 	a	population	of	more	than	six	and	a	half	billion	people	.
and	last	year	,	our	population	grew	by	80	million	.
i	mean	,	these	are	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 number 	 s 	 	.
you	can	see	here	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	taken	from	al	gore	's	book	.	but	what	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	is	our	technology	 ha 	 s 	 	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	the	 check 	 s 	 	and	 balance 	 s 	 	on	our	population	growth	.
we	have	to	control	our	 number 	 s 	 	,	and	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	else	that	's	 be 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	in	the	world	 to 	 day 	 	.

my	father	so	 appropriate 	 ly 	 	put	it	,	that	``	we	are	 certain 	 ly 	 	the	 on 	 ly 	 	animal	that	 make 	 s 	 	conscious	 choice 	 s 	 	that	are	bad	for	our	 surviv 	 al 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	species	.	``
can	we	hold	it	together	?
it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	remember	that	we	all	 evolv 	 ed 	 	in	africa	.
we	all	have	an	african	origin	.
we	have	a	common	past	and	we	share	a	common	future	.
 evolution 	 arily 	 	 s 	 peaking 	 	,	we	're	just	a	 bli 	 p 	 	.
we	're	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	on	the	edge	of	a	 pre 	 cipice 	 	,	and	we	have	the	 tool 	 s 	 	and	the	technology	at	our	 hand 	 s 	 	to	communicate	what	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 d 	 one 	 	to	hold	it	together	 to 	 day 	 	.
we	could	tell	every	single	human	 be 	 ing 	 	out	there	,	if	we	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	.
but	will	we	do	that	,	or	will	we	just	let	nature	take	 it 	 s 	 	course	?
well	,	to	end	on	a	 ver 	 y 	 	positive	note	,	i	think	 evolution 	 arily 	 	 s 	 peaking 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	a	 fair 	 ly 	 	good	thing	,	in	the	end	.
i	'll	 leav 	 e 	 	it	at	that	,	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
