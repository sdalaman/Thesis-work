 em 	 bracing 	 	 other 	 ness 	 	.
when	i	first	heard	 th 	 is 	 	theme	,	i	thought	,	well	,	 em 	 bracing 	 	 other 	 ness 	 	is	 em 	 bracing 	 	 my 	 self 	 	.
and	the	journey	to	that	place	of	 understand 	 ing 	 	and	 accept 	 ance 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	one	for	me	,	and	it	's	 give 	 n 	 	me	an	 in 	 sight 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	whole	 not 	 ion 	 	of	self	,	which	i	think	is	worth	sharing	with	you	 to 	 day 	 	.
we	each	have	a	self	,	but	i	do	n't	think	that	we	're	born	with	one	.
you	know	how	 new 	 born 	 	 bab 	 ies 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	they	're	part	of	 every 	 thing 	 	;	they	're	not	 separat 	 e 	 	?
well	that	fundamental	sense	of	 one 	 ness 	 	is	lost	on	us	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
it	's	like	that	 initi 	 al 	 	stage	is	over	--	 one 	 ness 	 	:	 inf 	 ancy 	 	,	 un 	 form 	 ed 	 	,	primitive	.
it	's	no	 long 	 er 	 	valid	or	real	.
what	is	real	is	 separat 	 e 	 ness 	 	,
and	at	some	point	in	early	 baby 	 hood 	 	,	the	idea	of	self	 start 	 s 	 	to	form	.
our	little	 port 	 ion 	 	of	 one 	 ness 	 	is	 give 	 n 	 	a	name	,	is	told	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	about	 it 	 self 	 	,
and	these	 detail 	 s 	 	,	 opinion 	 s 	 	and	 idea 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 fact 	 s 	 	,	which	go	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	building	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	our	 ident 	 ity 	 	.
and	that	self	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	the	vehicle	for	 navig 	 ating 	 	our	social	world	.
but	the	self	is	a	 project 	 ion 	 	based	on	other	people	's	 project 	 ions 	 	.
is	it	who	we	 re 	 ally 	 	are	?
or	who	we	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	be	,	or	should	be	?
so	 th 	 is 	 	whole	 interact 	 ion 	 	with	self	and	 ident 	 ity 	 	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	one	for	me	growing	up	.
the	self	that	i	 attempt 	 ed 	 	to	take	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	world	was	 reject 	 ed 	 	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	my	panic	at	not	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	self	that	fit	,	and	the	 con 	 fusion 	 	that	came	from	my	self	 be 	 ing 	 	 reject 	 ed 	 	,	 create 	 d 	 	 anxie 	 ty 	 	,	shame	and	 hope 	 lessness 	 	,	which	kind	of	defined	me	for	a	long	time	.
but	in	retrospect	,	the	 destruct 	 ion 	 	of	my	self	was	so	 repetit 	 ive 	 	that	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	see	a	pattern	.
the	self	 change 	 d 	 	,	got	 affect 	 ed 	 	,	broken	,	 destroy 	 ed 	 	,	but	 an 	 other 	 	one	would	evolve	--
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 strong 	 er 	 	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 hate 	 ful 	 	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	not	 want 	 ing 	 	to	be	there	at	all	.
the	self	was	not	constant	.
and	how	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	would	my	self	have	to	die	before	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	it	was	never	 al 	 ive 	 	in	the	first	place	?
i	grew	up	on	the	coast	of	england	in	the	'70s	.
my	dad	is	white	from	cornwall	,	and	my	mom	is	black	from	zimbabwe	.
even	the	idea	of	us	 a 	 s 	 	a	family	was	 challeng 	 ing 	 	to	most	people	.
but	nature	had	 it 	 s 	 	 wick 	 ed 	 	way	,	and	 brow 	 n 	 	 bab 	 ies 	 	 we 	 re 	 	born	.
but	from	about	the	age	of	five	,	i	was	aware	that	i	did	n't	fit	.
i	was	the	black	atheist	kid	in	the	all	-	white	catholic	school	run	by	 n 	 un 	 s 	 	.
i	was	an	 anomal 	 y 	 	,
and	my	self	was	 root 	 ing 	 	around	for	definition	and	 try 	 ing 	 	to	plug	in	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	self	 like 	 s 	 	to	fit	,	to	see	 it 	 self 	 	 replicate 	 d 	 	,	to	belong	.
that	 confirm 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 exist 	 ence 	 	and	 it 	 s 	 	 import 	 ance 	 	.
and	it	is	 import 	 ant 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	an	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	function	.
 with 	 out 	 	it	,	we	 liter 	 ally 	 	ca	n't	 inter 	 face 	 	with	 other 	 s 	 	.
we	ca	n't	hatch	 plan 	 s 	 	and	climb	that	 stair 	 way 	 	of	 popular 	 ity 	 	,	of	success	.
but	my	skin	color	was	n't	right	.
my	hair	was	n't	right	.
my	 histo 	 ry 	 	was	n't	right	.
my	self	 be 	 came 	 	defined	by	 other 	 ness 	 	,	which	 me 	 ant 	 	that	,	in	that	social	world	,	i	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	exist	.
and	i	was	``	other	``	before	 be 	 ing 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	else	--	even	before	 be 	 ing 	 	a	girl	.
i	was	a	 notice 	 able 	 	 no 	 body 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	world	was	 open 	 ing 	 	up	around	 th 	 is 	 	time	:	performance	and	 danc 	 ing 	 	.
that	 nag 	 ging 	 	dread	of	self	-	hood	did	n't	exist	when	i	was	 danc 	 ing 	 	.
i	'd	 liter 	 ally 	 	lose	 my 	 self 	 	.
and	i	was	a	 re 	 ally 	 	good	 danc 	 er 	 	.
i	would	put	all	my	 emotion 	 al 	 	 express 	 ion 	 	 in 	 to 	 	my	 danc 	 ing 	 	.
i	could	be	in	the	 move 	 ment 	 	in	a	way	that	i	was	n't	able	to	be	in	my	real	life	,	in	 my 	 self 	 	.
and	at	16	,	i	 s 	 tumble 	 d 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	 an 	 other 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	,	and	i	 earn 	 ed 	 	my	first	 act 	 ing 	 	role	in	a	film	.
i	can	 hard 	 ly 	 	find	the	 word 	 s 	 	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	the	peace	i	felt	when	i	was	 act 	 ing 	 	.
my	 dy 	 s 	 functional 	 	self	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	plug	in	to	 an 	 other 	 	self	,	not	my	own	,
and	it	felt	so	good	.
it	was	the	first	time	that	i	 exist 	 ed 	 	 in 	 side 	 	a	fully	-	 function 	 ing 	 	self	--	one	that	i	controlled	,	that	i	 steer 	 ed 	 	,	that	i	 g 	 ave 	 	life	to	.
but	the	 shoot 	 ing 	 	day	would	end	,	and	i	'd	return	to	my	 gna 	 r 	 ly 	 	,	awkward	self	.
by	19	,	i	was	a	fully	-	fledged	movie	 a 	 ctor 	 	,	but	still	 search 	 ing 	 	for	definition	.
i	 appli 	 ed 	 	to	read	 anthropo 	 logy 	 	at	university	.
dr.	phyllis	lee	 g 	 ave 	 	me	my	interview	,	and	she	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	,	``	how	would	you	define	race	?	``	well	,	i	thought	i	had	the	answer	to	that	one	,
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	skin	color	.	``	``	so	biology	,	 genetic 	 s 	 	?	``	she	 s 	 aid 	 	.
``	 be 	 cause 	 	,	thandie	,	that	's	not	accurate	.
 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	more	genetic	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	a	black	kenyan	and	a	black	ugandan	than	there	is	between	a	black	kenyan	and	,	say	,	a	white	norwegian	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	all	stem	from	africa	.
so	in	africa	,	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	more	time	to	create	genetic	 divers 	 ity 	 	.	``	in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	race	 ha 	 s 	 	no	 bas 	 is 	 	in	 bio 	 logical 	 	or	scientific	fact	.
on	the	one	hand	,	result	.
right	?
on	the	other	hand	,	my	definition	of	self	just	lost	a	huge	chunk	of	 it 	 s 	 	 cr 	 ed 	 ibility 	 	.
but	what	was	credible	,	what	is	 bio 	 logical 	 	and	scientific	fact	,	is	that	we	all	stem	from	africa	--	in	fact	,	from	a	woman	 call 	 ed 	 	 mitochondria 	 l 	 	eve	who	lived	160,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	race	is	an	 il 	 legitimate 	 	 con 	 cept 	 	which	our	 s 	 elves 	 	have	 create 	 d 	 	based	on	fear	and	 ignor 	 ance 	 	.
 strange 	 ly 	 	,	these	 revel 	 ations 	 	did	n't	cure	my	low	self	-	esteem	,	that	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	 other 	 ness 	 	.
my	 desir 	 e 	 	to	disappear	was	still	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	.
i	had	a	degree	from	cambridge	;	i	had	a	 thriv 	 ing 	 	 care 	 er 	 	,	but	my	self	was	a	car	crash	,	and	i	wound	up	with	bulimia	and	on	a	therapist	's	couch	.
and	of	course	i	did	.
i	still	 believ 	 ed 	 	my	self	was	all	i	was	.
i	still	 valu 	 ed 	 	self	-	worth	above	all	other	worth	,
and	what	was	there	to	suggest	 other 	 wise 	 	?
we	've	 create 	 d 	 	entire	value	 system 	 s 	 	and	a	physical	 re 	 ality 	 	to	support	the	worth	of	self	.
look	at	the	industry	for	self	-	image	and	the	 job 	 s 	 	it	 create 	 s 	 	,	the	revenue	it	 turn 	 s 	 	over	.
we	'd	be	right	in	 assum 	 ing 	 	that	the	self	is	an	actual	living	thing	.
but	it	's	not	.	it	's	a	 project 	 ion 	 	which	our	clever	 brain 	 s 	 	create	in	order	to	cheat	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	from	the	 re 	 ality 	 	of	death	.
but	there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	can	give	the	self	ultimate	and	infinite	 connect 	 ion 	 	--	and	that	thing	is	 one 	 ness 	 	,	our	 es 	 s 	 ence 	 	.
the	self	's	struggle	for	 authentic 	 ity 	 	and	definition	will	never	end	 un 	 less 	 	it	's	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	 it 	 s 	 	creator	--	to	you	and	to	me	.
and	that	can	happen	with	 aware 	 ness 	 	--	 aware 	 ness 	 	of	the	 re 	 ality 	 	of	 one 	 ness 	 	and	the	 project 	 ion 	 	of	self	-	hood	.
for	a	start	,	we	can	think	about	all	the	 time 	 s 	 	when	we	do	lose	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
it	 happen 	 s 	 	when	i	dance	,	when	i	'm	 act 	 ing 	 	.
i	'm	 earth 	 ed 	 	in	my	 es 	 s 	 ence 	 	,	and	my	self	is	 suspend 	 ed 	 	.
in	 t 	 hose 	 	 moment 	 s 	 	,	i	'm	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	 every 	 thing 	 	--	the	ground	,	the	air	,	the	 sound 	 s 	 	,	the	energy	from	the	audience	.
all	my	 sense 	 s 	 	are	alert	and	 al 	 ive 	 	in	much	the	same	way	 a 	 s 	 	an	infant	might	feel	--	that	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	 one 	 ness 	 	.
and	when	i	'm	 act 	 ing 	 	a	role	,	i	inhabit	 an 	 other 	 	self	,	and	i	give	it	life	for	 a 	 while 	 	,
 be 	 cause 	 	when	the	self	is	 suspend 	 ed 	 	so	is	 divisive 	 ness 	 	and	judgment	.
and	i	've	 play 	 ed 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	from	a	 venge 	 ful 	 	ghost	in	the	time	of	 slave 	 ry 	 	to	 secret 	 ary 	 	of	state	in	2004	.
and	no	matter	how	other	these	 s 	 elves 	 	might	be	,	they	're	all	related	in	me	.
and	i	 honest 	 ly 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	the	key	to	my	success	 a 	 s 	 	an	 a 	 ctor 	 	and	my	progress	 a 	 s 	 	a	person	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	the	 ver 	 y 	 	lack	of	self	that	used	to	make	me	feel	so	 anx 	 ious 	 	and	 in 	 secure 	 	.
i	 al 	 ways 	 	 wonder 	 ed 	 	why	i	could	feel	 other 	 s 	 	'	pain	so	 deep 	 ly 	 	,	why	i	could	 recogn 	 ize 	 	the	 some 	 body 	 	in	the	 no 	 body 	 	.
it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	i	did	n't	have	a	self	to	get	in	the	way	.
i	thought	i	 lack 	 ed 	 	 sub 	 stance 	 	,	and	the	fact	that	i	could	feel	 other 	 s 	 	'	 me 	 ant 	 	that	i	had	 noth 	 ing 	 	of	 my 	 self 	 	to	feel	.
the	thing	that	was	a	source	of	shame	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	source	of	 enlighten 	 ment 	 	.
and	when	i	 real 	 ized 	 	and	 re 	 ally 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	that	my	self	is	a	 project 	 ion 	 	and	that	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	function	,	a	funny	thing	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
i	 stop 	 ped 	 	giving	it	so	much	 author 	 ity 	 	.
i	give	it	 it 	 s 	 	due	.
i	take	it	to	therapy	.
i	've	 be 	 come 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	familiar	with	 it 	 s 	 	 dy 	 s 	 functional 	 	behavior	.
but	i	'm	not	 a 	 shame 	 d 	 	of	my	self	.
in	fact	,	i	respect	my	self	and	 it 	 s 	 	function	.
and	over	time	and	with	practice	,	i	've	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	live	more	and	more	from	my	 es 	 s 	 ence 	 	.
and	if	you	can	do	that	,	 in 	 credible 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	happen	.
i	was	in	congo	in	february	,	 danc 	 ing 	 	and	 celebr 	 ating 	 	with	women	who	've	 surviv 	 ed 	 	the	 destruct 	 ion 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	 liter 	 ally 	 	 un 	 think 	 able 	 	ways	--	 destroy 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	other	 brutal 	 ized 	 	,	 psychopath 	 ic 	 	 s 	 elves 	 	all	over	that	 beaut 	 iful 	 	land	are	 fuel 	 ing 	 	our	 s 	 elves 	 	'	 addict 	 ion 	 	to	ipods	,	 pad 	 s 	 	,	and	bling	,	which	further	 dis 	 connect 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	from	ever	 feel 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	pain	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 suffer 	 ing 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	death	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	 he 	 y 	 	,	if	we	're	all	living	in	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	 mistak 	 ing 	 	it	for	life	,	then	we	're	 d 	 evalu 	 ing 	 	and	 desensi 	 tizing 	 	life	.
and	in	that	 dis 	 connect 	 ed 	 	state	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	we	can	build	 factor 	 y 	 	 farm 	 s 	 	with	no	 window 	 s 	 	,	destroy	marine	life	and	use	rape	 a 	 s 	 	a	weapon	of	war	.
so	here	's	a	note	to	self	:	the	 crack 	 s 	 	have	 start 	 ed 	 	to	show	in	our	 construct 	 ed 	 	world	,	and	 ocean 	 s 	 	will	 continu 	 e 	 	to	 s 	 urge 	 	through	the	 crack 	 s 	 	,	and	oil	and	blood	,	 river 	 s 	 	of	it	.
 cruci 	 ally 	 	,	we	have	n't	 be 	 en 	 	 figur 	 ing 	 	out	how	to	live	in	 one 	 ness 	 	with	the	earth	and	every	other	living	thing	.
we	've	just	 be 	 en 	 	 insan 	 e 	 ly 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	how	to	live	with	each	other	--	 billion 	 s 	 	of	each	other	.
 on 	 ly 	 	we	're	not	living	with	each	other	;	our	crazy	 s 	 elves 	 	are	living	with	each	other	and	 perpetu 	 ating 	 	an	 epi 	 demic 	 	of	 dis 	 connect 	 ion 	 	.
let	's	live	with	each	other	and	take	it	a	breath	at	a	time	.
if	we	can	get	under	that	heavy	self	,	light	a	torch	of	 aware 	 ness 	 	,	and	find	our	 es 	 s 	 ence 	 	,	our	 connect 	 ion 	 	to	the	infinite	and	every	other	living	thing	.
we	 k 	 new 	 	it	from	the	day	we	 we 	 re 	 	born	.
let	's	not	be	 freak 	 ed 	 	out	by	our	 bounti 	 ful 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 ness 	 	.
it	's	more	a	 re 	 ality 	 	than	the	 one 	 s 	 	our	 s 	 elves 	 	have	 create 	 d 	 	.
imagine	what	kind	of	 exist 	 ence 	 	we	can	have	if	we	honor	 inevit 	 able 	 	death	of	self	,	appreciate	the	privilege	of	life	and	marvel	at	what	 come 	 s 	 	next	.
simple	 aware 	 ness 	 	is	where	it	 begin 	 s 	 	.
thank	you	for	 listen 	 ing 	 	.
