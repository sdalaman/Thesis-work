i	 stud 	 y 	 	how	the	brain	 process 	 es 	 
information	.	that	is	,	how	it	 take 	 s 	 	information	in	from	the	 out 	 side 	 	world	,	and	 convert 	 s 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	of	 electric 	 al 	 	activity	,	and	then	how	it	uses	 t 	 hose 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	to	allow	you	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	--	to	see	,	hear	,	to	reach	for	an	object	.
so	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	a	 bas 	 ic 	 	scientist	,	not	a	 clinic 	 ian 	 	,	but	in	the	last	year	and	a	half	i	've	 start 	 ed 	 	to	 s 	 witch 	 	over	,	to	use	what	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	about	these	 pattern 	 s 	 	of	activity	to	develop	 prost 	 hetic 	 	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	,	and	what	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	 to 	 day 	 	is	show	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	our	first	 fo 	 ray 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	's	the	 develop 	 ment 	 	of	a	 prost 	 hetic 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	for	 treat 	 ing 	 	 blind 	 ness 	 	.
so	let	me	start	in	on	that	problem	.
there	are	10	million	people	in	the	u.s.	and	 man 	 y 	 	more	 world 	 wide 	 	who	are	blind	or	are	facing	 blind 	 ness 	 	due	to	 disease 	 s 	 	of	the	retina	,	 disease 	 s 	 	like	 ma 	 cular 	 	 de 	 generation 	 	,	and	there	's	little	that	can	be	 d 	 one 	 	for	them	.
there	are	some	drug	 treat 	 ments 	 	,	but	they	're	 on 	 ly 	 	effective	on	a	small	fraction	of	the	population	.	and	so	,	for	the	vast	 major 	 ity 	 	of	 patient 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	best	hope	for	 regain 	 ing 	 	sight	is	through	 prost 	 hetic 	 	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	.
the	problem	is	that	current	 prost 	 hetic 	 s 	 	do	n't	work	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.	they	're	still	 ver 	 y 	 	 limit 	 ed 	 	in	the	vision	that	they	can	provide	.
and	so	,	you	know	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	with	these	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	,	 patient 	 s 	 	can	see	simple	 thing 	 s 	 	like	bright	 light 	 s 	 	and	high	contrast	 edge 	 s 	 	,	not	 ver 	 y 	 	much	more	,	so	 noth 	 ing 	 	close	to	normal	vision	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	possible	.
so	what	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	about	 to 	 day 	 	is	a	 de 	 vice 	 	that	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	that	i	think	 ha 	 s 	 	the	potential	to	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	,	to	be	much	more	effective	,	and	what	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	is	show	you	how	it	 work 	 s 	 	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	let	me	back	up	a	little	bit	and	show	you	how	a	normal	retina	 work 	 s 	 	first	so	you	can	see	the	problem	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	solve	.
here	you	have	a	retina	.
so	you	have	an	image	,	a	retina	,	and	a	brain	.
so	when	you	look	at	 some 	 thing 	 	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	image	of	 th 	 is 	 	baby	's	face	,	it	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	your	eye	and	it	 land 	 s 	 	on	your	retina	,	on	the	front	-	end	 cell 	 s 	 	here	,	the	 photo 	 receptor 	 s 	 	.
then	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	the	 retina 	 l 	 	 circuit 	 ry 	 	,	the	middle	part	,	 go 	 es 	 	to	work	on	it	,	and	what	it	 do 	 es 	 	is	it	 perform 	 s 	 	 operation 	 s 	 	on	it	,	it	 ex 	 tract 	 s 	 	information	from	it	,	and	it	 convert 	 s 	 	that	information	 in 	 to 	 	a	code	.
and	the	code	is	in	the	form	of	these	 pattern 	 s 	 	of	 electric 	 al 	 	 puls 	 es 	 	that	get	 s 	 ent 	 	up	to	the	brain	,	and	so	the	key	thing	is	that	the	image	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	 get 	 s 	 	 convert 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	code	.	and	when	i	say	code	,	i	do	 liter 	 ally 	 	mean	code	.
like	 th 	 is 	 	pattern	of	 puls 	 es 	 	here	 actual 	 ly 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	``	baby	's	face	,	``	and	so	when	the	brain	 get 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	pattern	of	 puls 	 es 	 	,	it	 know 	 s 	 	that	what	was	out	there	was	a	baby	's	face	,	and	if	it	got	a	different	pattern	it	would	know	that	what	was	out	there	was	,	say	,	a	dog	,	or	 an 	 other 	 	pattern	would	be	a	house	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	you	get	the	idea	.
and	,	of	course	,	in	real	life	,	it	's	all	dynamic	,	meaning	that	it	's	changing	all	the	time	,	so	the	 pattern 	 s 	 	of	 puls 	 es 	 	are	changing	all	the	time	 be 	 cause 	 	the	world	you	're	looking	at	is	changing	all	the	time	too	.
so	,	you	know	,	it	's	sort	of	a	 complic 	 ated 	 
thing	.	you	have	these	 pattern 	 s 	 	of	 puls 	 es 	 	coming	out	of	your	eye	every	 milli 	 second 	 	 tell 	 ing 	 	your	brain	what	it	is	that	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	.
so	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	a	person	 get 	 s 	 	a	 retina 	 l 	 	 de 	 generative 	 	disease	like	 ma 	 cular 	 	 de 	 generation 	 	?	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	is	that	,	the	front	-	end	 cell 	 s 	 	die	,	the	 photo 	 receptor 	 s 	 	die	,	and	over	time	,	all	the	 cell 	 s 	 	and	the	 circuit 	 s 	 	that	are	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	them	,	they	die	too	.
 un 	 til 	 	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	have	left	are	these	 cell 	 s 	 	here	,	the	 out 	 put 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	,	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	 s 	 end 	 	the	 signal 	 s 	 	to	the	brain	,	but	 be 	 cause 	 	of	all	that	 de 	 generation 	 	they	are	n't	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	any	 signal 	 s 	 	 any 	 more 	 	.
they	are	n't	 get 	 ting 	 	any	 in 	 put 	 	,	so	the	person	's	brain	no	 long 	 er 	 	 get 	 s 	 	any	visual	information	--	that	is	,	he	or	she	is	blind	.
so	,	a	solution	to	the	problem	,	then	,	would	be	to	build	a	 de 	 vice 	 	that	could	mimic	the	 action 	 s 	 	of	that	front	-	end	 circuit 	 ry 	 	and	 s 	 end 	 	 signal 	 s 	 	to	the	retina	's	 out 	 put 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	,	and	they	can	go	back	to	 do 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	normal	job	of	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	 signal 	 s 	 	to	the	brain	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	our	 prost 	 hetic 	 	 do 	 es 	 	.
so	it	 consist 	 s 	 	of	two	 part 	 s 	 	,	what	we	call	an	 encode 	 r 	 	and	a	transducer	.
and	so	the	 encode 	 r 	 	 do 	 es 	 	just	what	i	was	 say 	 ing 	 	:	it	 mimic 	 s 	 	the	 action 	 s 	 	of	the	front	-	end	 circuit 	 ry 	 	--	so	it	 take 	 s 	 	 image 	 s 	 	in	and	 convert 	 s 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	the	retina	's	code	.
and	then	the	transducer	then	 make 	 s 	 	the	 out 	 put 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	 s 	 end 	 	the	code	on	up	to	the	brain	,	and	the	result	is	a	 retina 	 l 	 	 prost 	 hetic 	 	that	can	produce	normal	 retina 	 l 	 	 out 	 put 	 	.
so	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	blind	retina	,	even	one	with	no	front	-	end	 circuit 	 ry 	 	at	all	,	no	 photo 	 receptor 	 s 	 	,	can	now	 s 	 end 	 	out	normal	 signal 	 s 	 	,	 signal 	 s 	 	that	the	brain	can	understand	.
so	no	other	 de 	 vice 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	i	just	want	to	take	a	sentence	or	two	to	say	 some 	 thing 	 	about	the	 encode 	 r 	 	and	what	it	's	 do 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	the	key	part	and	it	's	sort	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	and	kind	of	cool	.
i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	``	cool	``	is	 re 	 ally 	 	the	right	word	,	but	you	know	what	i	mean	.
so	what	it	's	 do 	 ing 	 	is	,	it	's	 re 	 placing 	 	the	 retina 	 l 	 	 circuit 	 ry 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	the	 gut 	 s 	 	of	the	 retina 	 l 	 	 circuit 	 ry 	 	,	with	a	set	of	 equ 	 ations 	 	,	a	set	of	 equ 	 ations 	 	that	we	can	implement	on	a	chip	.	so	it	's	just	math	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	we	're	not	 liter 	 ally 	 	 re 	 placing 	 	the	 component 	 s 	 	of	the	retina	.
it	's	not	like	we	're	making	a	little	mini	-	 de 	 vice 	 	for	each	of	the	different	cell	 type 	 s 	 	.
we	've	just	 abstract 	 ed 	 	what	the	retina	's	 do 	 ing 	 	with	a	set	of	 equ 	 ations 	 	.
and	so	,	in	a	way	,	the	 equ 	 ations 	 	are	 serv 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	sort	of	a	 code 	 book 	 	.	an	image	 come 	 s 	 	in	,	 go 	 es 	 	through	the	set	of	 equ 	 ations 	 	,	and	out	 come 	 s 	 	 stream 	 s 	 	of	 electric 	 al 	 	 puls 	 es 	 	,	just	like	a	normal	retina	would	produce	.
now	let	me	put	my	money	where	my	mouth	is	and	show	you	that	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	produce	normal	 out 	 put 	 	,	and	what	the	 implic 	 ations 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	are	.
here	are	three	 set 	 s 	 	of	 fir 	 ing 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	.	the	top	one	is	from	a	normal	animal	,	the	middle	one	is	from	a	blind	animal	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	 treat 	 ed 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	 encode 	 r 	 	-	transducer	 de 	 vice 	 	,	and	the	bottom	one	is	from	a	blind	animal	 treat 	 ed 	 	with	a	standard	 prost 	 hetic 	 	.
so	the	bottom	one	is	the	state	-	of	-	the	-	art	 de 	 vice 	 	that	's	out	there	right	now	,	which	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	made	up	of	light	 detect 	 ors 	 	,	but	no	 encode 	 r 	 	.	so	what	we	did	was	we	 present 	 ed 	 	 movie 	 s 	 	of	 every 	 day 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	--	people	,	 bab 	 ies 	 	,	park	 bench 	 es 	 	,	you	know	,	regular	 thing 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	--	and	we	 record 	 ed 	 	the	 respons 	 es 	 	from	the	 retina 	 s 	 	of	these	three	 group 	 s 	 	of	 animal 	 s 	 	.
now	just	to	orient	you	,	each	box	is	 show 	 ing 	 	the	 fir 	 ing 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	of	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	,	and	just	 a 	 s 	 	in	the	previous	 slide 	 s 	 	,	each	row	is	a	different	cell	,	and	i	just	made	the	 puls 	 es 	 	a	little	bit	 small 	 er 	 	and	 th 	 inner 	 	so	i	could	show	you	a	long	stretch	of	data	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	the	 fir 	 ing 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	from	the	blind	animal	 treat 	 ed 	 	with	the	 encode 	 r 	 	-	transducer	 re 	 ally 	 	do	 ver 	 y 	 	 close 	 ly 	 	match	the	normal	 fir 	 ing 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	--	and	it	's	not	perfect	,	but	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	--
and	the	blind	animal	 treat 	 ed 	 	with	the	standard	 prost 	 hetic 	 	,	the	 respons 	 es 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	do	n't	.
and	so	with	the	standard	method	,	the	 cell 	 s 	 	do	fire	,	they	just	do	n't	fire	in	the	normal	 fir 	 ing 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	do	n't	have	the	right	code	.
how	 import 	 ant 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	?
what	's	the	potential	impact	on	a	patient	's	ability	to	see	?
so	i	'm	just	going	to	show	you	one	bottom	-	line	experiment	that	 answer 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	of	course	i	've	got	a	lot	of	other	data	,	so	if	you	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	i	'm	happy	to	show	more	.	so	the	experiment	is	 call 	 ed 	 	a	 re 	 construction 	 	experiment	.
so	what	we	did	is	we	took	a	moment	in	time	from	these	 record 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	what	was	the	retina	 see 	 ing 	 	at	that	moment	?
can	we	 re 	 construct 	 	what	the	retina	was	 see 	 ing 	 	from	the	 respons 	 es 	 	from	the	 fir 	 ing 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	?
so	,	when	we	did	 th 	 is 	 	for	 respons 	 es 	 	from	the	standard	method	and	from	our	 encode 	 r 	 	and	transducer	.
so	let	me	show	you	,	and	i	'm	going	to	start	with	the	standard	method	first	.
so	you	can	see	that	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	 limit 	 ed 	 	,	and	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 fir 	 ing 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	are	n't	in	the	right	code	,	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 limit 	 ed 	 	in	what	they	can	tell	you	about	what	's	out	there	.	so	you	can	see	that	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	there	,	but	it	's	not	so	clear	what	that	 some 	 thing 	 	is	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	just	sort	of	 circle 	 s 	 	back	to	what	i	was	 say 	 ing 	 	in	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	that	with	the	standard	method	,	 patient 	 s 	 	can	see	high	-	contrast	 edge 	 s 	 	,	they	can	see	light	,	but	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 eas 	 ily 	 	go	further	than	that	.	so	what	was	the	image	?	it	was	a	baby	's	face	.
so	what	about	with	our	approach	,	 add 	 ing 	 	the	code	?	and	you	can	see	that	it	's	much	better	.	not	 on 	 ly 	 	can	you	tell	that	it	's	a	baby	's	face	,	but	you	can	tell	that	it	's	 th 	 is 	 	baby	's	face	,	which	is	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 challeng 	 ing 	 	task	.
so	on	the	left	is	the	 encode 	 r 	 	 al 	 one 	 	,	and	on	the	right	is	from	an	actual	blind	retina	,	so	the	 encode 	 r 	 	and	the	transducer	.
but	the	key	one	 re 	 ally 	 	is	the	 encode 	 r 	 	 al 	 one 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	can	team	up	the	 encode 	 r 	 	with	the	different	transducer	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	just	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	first	one	that	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	.
i	just	 want 	 ed 	 	to	say	 some 	 thing 	 	about	the	standard	method	.
when	 th 	 is 	 	first	came	out	,	it	was	just	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	thing	,	the	idea	that	you	even	make	a	blind	retina	respond	at	all	.
but	there	was	 th 	 is 	 	 limit 	 ing 	 	factor	,	the	issue	of	the	code	,	and	how	to	make	the	 cell 	 s 	 	respond	better	,
produce	normal	 respons 	 es 	 	,	and	so	 th 	 is 	 	was	our	 con 	 trib 	 ution 	 	.
now	i	just	want	to	wrap	up	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	i	was	 ment 	 ion 	 ing 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	of	course	i	have	a	lot	of	other	data	if	you	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	,	but	i	just	 want 	 ed 	 	to	give	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	 bas 	 ic 	 	idea	of	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	communicate	with	the	brain	in	 it 	 s 	 	language	,	and	the	potential	power	of	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	do	that	.
so	it	's	different	from	the	motor	 prost 	 hetic 	 s 	 	where	you	're	 commun 	 ic 	 ating 	 	from	the	brain	to	a	 de 	 vice 	 	.	here	we	have	to	communicate	from	the	 out 	 side 	 	world	 in 	 to 	 	the	brain	and	be	 under 	 stood 	 	,	and	be	 under 	 stood 	 	by	the	brain	.
and	then	the	last	thing	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	say	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	is	to	 emphas 	 ize 	 	that	the	idea	 general 	 ize 	 s 	 	.
so	the	same	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	that	we	used	to	find	the	code	for	the	retina	we	can	 al 	 so 	 	use	to	find	the	code	for	other	 area 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	the	 audit 	 ory 	 	system	and	the	motor	system	,	so	for	 treat 	 ing 	 	 deaf 	 ness 	 	and	for	motor	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	.
so	just	the	same	way	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	jump	over	the	 damage 	 d 	 	 circuit 	 ry 	 	in	the	retina	to	get	to	the	retina	's	 out 	 put 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	,	we	can	jump	over	the	 damage 	 d 	 	 circuit 	 ry 	 	in	the	cochlea	to	get	the	 audit 	 ory 	 	nerve	,	or	jump	over	 damage 	 d 	 	 area 	 s 	 	in	the	cortex	,	in	the	motor	cortex	,	to	bridge	the	gap	 produce 	 d 	 	by	a	stroke	.
i	just	want	to	end	with	a	simple	 mess 	 age 	 	that	 understand 	 ing 	 	the	code	is	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	and	if	we	can	understand	the	code	,	the	language	of	the	brain	,	 thing 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	possible	that	did	n't	seem	 obvious 	 ly
