the	value	of	 noth 	 ing 	 	:	out	of	 noth 	 ing 	 	 come 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	.
that	was	an	essay	i	wrote	when	i	was	11	 year 	 s 	 	old	and	i	got	a	b	+	.
what	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	:	 noth 	 ing 	 	out	of	 some 	 thing 	 	,	and	how	we	create	.
and	i	'm	gon	na	try	and	do	that	 with 	 in 	 	the	18	-	minute	time	span	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	told	to	stay	 with 	 in 	 	,	and	to	follow	the	ted	 command 	 ments 	 	:	that	is	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 create 	 s 	 	a	near	-	death	experience	,	but	near	-	death	is	good	for	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	.
ok	.
so	,	i	 al 	 so 	 	want	to	explain	,	 be 	 cause 	 	dave	eggers	 s 	 aid 	 	he	was	going	to	 heck 	 le 	 	me	if	i	 s 	 aid 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	that	was	a	lie	,	or	not	true	to	universal	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	.
and	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	it	 th 	 is 	 	way	for	half	the	audience	,	who	is	scientific	.
when	i	say	we	,	i	do	n't	mean	you	,	 necess 	 arily 	 	;	i	mean	me	,	and	my	right	brain	,	my	left	brain	and	the	one	that	's	in	between	that	is	the	censor	and	 tell 	 s 	 	me	what	i	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	is	wrong	.
and	i	'm	going	do	that	 al 	 so 	 	by	looking	at	what	i	think	is	part	of	my	creative	process	,	which	 include 	 s 	 	a	number	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	the	 noth 	 ing 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	even	 ear 	 lier 	 	than	the	moment	in	which	i	'm	creating	 some 	 thing 	 	new	.
and	that	 include 	 s 	 	nature	,	and	nurture	,	and	what	i	refer	to	 a 	 s 	 	 nightmare 	 s 	 	.
now	in	the	nature	area	,	we	look	at	 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	we	are	 innate 	 ly 	 	 equi 	 pped 	 	with	 some 	 thing 	 	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	in	our	 brain 	 s 	 	,	some	 ab 	 normal 	 	 chromosom 	 e 	 	that	 cause 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	muse	-	like	effect	.
and	some	people	would	say	that	we	're	born	with	it	in	some	other	 mean 	 s 	 	.	and	 other 	 s 	 	,	like	my	mother	,	would	say	that	i	get	my	material	from	past	 live 	 s 	 	.
some	people	would	 al 	 so 	 	say	that	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	may	be	a	function	of	some	other	 neuro 	 logical 	 	quirk	--	van	gogh	syndrome	--	that	you	have	a	little	bit	of	,	you	know	,	 psycho 	 sis 	 	,	or	 depress 	 ion 	 	.
i	do	have	to	say	,	 some 	 body 	 	--	i	read	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	that	van	gogh	was	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 necess 	 arily 	 	 psycho 	 tic 	 	,	that	he	might	have	had	temporal	lobe	 seizure 	 s 	 	,	and	that	might	have	 caus 	 ed 	 	his	spurt	of	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	,	and	i	do	n't	--
i	suppose	it	 do 	 es 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	in	some	part	of	your	brain	.
and	i	will	 ment 	 ion 	 	that	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	temporal	lobe	 seizure 	 s 	 	a	number	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	but	it	was	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	time	i	was	writing	my	last	book	,	and	some	people	say	that	book	is	 quit 	 e 	 	different	.
i	think	that	part	of	it	 al 	 so 	 	 begin 	 s 	 	with	a	sense	of	 ident 	 ity 	 	crisis	:	you	know	,	who	am	i	,	why	am	i	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	person	,	why	am	i	not	black	like	 every 	 body 	 	else	?
and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	you	're	 equi 	 pped 	 	with	 skill 	 s 	 	,	but	they	may	not	be	the	kind	of	 skill 	 s 	 	that	 en 	 able 	 	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	.
i	used	to	draw	.	i	thought	i	would	be	an	artist	.
and	i	had	a	 miniatur 	 e 	 	 poo 	 d 	 le 	 	.
and	it	was	n't	bad	,	but	it	was	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	creative	.
 be 	 cause 	 	all	i	could	 re 	 ally 	 	do	was	represent	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	one	-	on	-	one	way	.
and	i	have	a	sense	that	i	 prob 	 ably 	 	 cop 	 ied 	 	 th 	 is 	 	from	a	book	.
and	then	,	i	 al 	 so 	 	was	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 shin 	 ing 	 	in	a	certain	area	that	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	,	and	you	know	,	you	look	at	 t 	 hose 	 	 score 	 s 	 	,	and	it	was	n't	bad	,	but	it	was	not	 certain 	 ly 	 	 predict 	 ive 	 	that	i	would	one	day	make	my	living	out	of	the	 art 	 ful 	 	 arrange 	 ment 	 	of	 word 	 s 	 	.
 al 	 so 	 	,	one	of	the	 principle 	 s 	 	of	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	is	to	have	a	little	 child 	 hood 	 	trauma	.
and	i	had	the	usual	kind	that	i	think	a	lot	of	people	had	,	and	that	is	that	,	you	know	,	i	had	 expect 	 ations 	 	 place 	 d 	 	on	me	.
that	figure	right	there	,	by	the	way	,	figure	right	there	was	a	 to 	 y 	 	 give 	 n 	 	to	me	when	i	was	but	nine	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	and	it	was	to	help	me	 be 	 come 	 	a	doctor	from	a	 ver 	 y 	 	early	age	.
i	have	some	 one 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	long	 last 	 ing 	 	:	from	the	age	of	five	to	15	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	my	side	occupation	,	and	it	led	to	a	sense	of	failure	.
but	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	there	was	 some 	 thing 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	real	in	my	life	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	when	i	was	about	14	.
and	it	was	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	my	brother	,	in	1967	,	and	then	my	father	,	six	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	had	brain	 tumor 	 s 	 	.
and	my	mother	 believ 	 ed 	 	that	 some 	 thing 	 	had	gone	wrong	,	and	she	was	gon	na	find	out	what	it	was	,	and	she	was	gon	na	fix	it	.
my	father	was	a	baptist	 mini 	 ster 	 	,	and	he	 believ 	 ed 	 	in	 miracle 	 s 	 	,	and	that	god	's	will	would	take	care	of	that	.
but	,	of	course	,	they	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 dy 	 ing 	 	,	six	 month 	 s 	 	 a 	 part 	 	.
and	after	that	,	my	mother	 believ 	 ed 	 	that	it	was	fate	,	or	 curse 	 s 	 	--	she	went	looking	through	all	the	 reason 	 s 	 	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	why	 th 	 is 	 	would	have	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
 every 	 thing 	 	 ex 	 cept 	 	 random 	 ness 	 	.	she	did	not	 believ 	 e 	 	in	 random 	 ness 	 	.
there	was	a	reason	for	 every 	 thing 	 	.
and	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	,	she	thought	,	was	that	her	mother	,	who	had	 di 	 ed 	 	when	she	was	 ver 	 y 	 	young	,	was	 ang 	 ry 	 	at	her	.
and	so	,	i	had	 th 	 is 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	of	death	all	around	me	,	 be 	 cause 	 	my	mother	 al 	 so 	 	 believ 	 ed 	 	that	i	would	be	next	,	and	she	would	be	next	.	and	when	you	are	 face 	 d 	 	with	the	prospect	of	death	 ver 	 y 	 	soon	,	you	begin	to	think	 ver 	 y 	 	much	about	 every 	 thing 	 	.
you	 be 	 come 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	creative	,	in	a	 surviv 	 al 	 	sense	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	,	then	,	led	to	my	big	 question 	 s 	 	.
and	they	're	the	same	 one 	 s 	 	that	i	have	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	they	are	:	why	do	 thing 	 s 	 	happen	,	and	how	do	 thing 	 s 	 	happen	?
and	the	one	my	mother	 ask 	 ed 	 	:	how	do	i	make	 thing 	 s 	 	happen	?
it	's	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	way	to	look	at	these	 question 	 s 	 	,	when	you	write	a	story	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	after	all	,	in	that	 frame 	 work 	 	,	between	page	one	and	300	,	you	have	to	answer	 th 	 is 	 	question	of	why	 thing 	 s 	 	happen	,	how	 thing 	 s 	 	happen	,	in	what	order	they	happen	.	what	are	the	 influence 	 s 	 	?
how	do	i	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	 nar 	 rator 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	writer	,	 al 	 so 	 	influence	that	?
and	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	one	that	,	i	think	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	our	 scientist 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	a	kind	of	 cosmo 	 logy 	 	,	and	i	have	to	develop	a	 cosmo 	 logy 	 	of	my	own	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	creator	of	that	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
and	you	see	,	there	's	a	lot	of	back	and	forth	in	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	that	happen	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	it	out
--	 year 	 s 	 	and	 year 	 s 	 	,	 often 	 time 	 s 	 	.
so	,	when	i	look	at	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	,	i	 al 	 so 	 	think	that	it	is	 th 	 is 	 	sense	or	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 ability 	 	to	repress	,	my	looking	at	 associ 	 ations 	 	in	 practical 	 ly 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	in	life	.
and	i	got	a	lot	of	them	 dur 	 ing 	 	what	's	 be 	 en 	 	going	on	 through 	 out 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	,	 al 	 most 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	going	on	.
and	so	i	'm	going	to	use	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	metaphor	,	 th 	 is 	 	 associ 	 ation 	 	:	 quant 	 um 	 	 mechanic 	 s 	 	,	which	i	 re 	 ally 	 	do	n't	understand	,	but	i	'm	still	gon	na	use	it	 a 	 s 	 	the	process	for	 explain 	 ing 	 	how	it	is	the	metaphor	.
so	,	in	 quant 	 um 	 	 mechanic 	 s 	 	,	of	course	,	you	have	dark	energy	and	dark	matter	.
and	it	's	the	same	thing	in	looking	at	these	 question 	 s 	 	of	how	 thing 	 s 	 	happen	.
there	's	a	lot	of	 un 	 known 	 	,	and	you	often	do	n't	know	what	it	is	 ex 	 cept 	 	by	 it 	 s 	 	 ab 	 s 	 ence 	 	.
but	when	you	make	 t 	 hose 	 	 associ 	 ations 	 	,	you	want	them	to	come	together	in	a	kind	of	 syn 	 er 	 gy 	 	in	the	story	,	and	what	you	're	 find 	 ing 	 	is	what	 matter 	 s 	 	.	the	meaning	.
and	that	's	what	i	look	for	in	my	work	,	a	personal	meaning	.
there	is	 al 	 so 	 	the	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	principle	,	which	is	part	of	 quant 	 um 	 	 mechanic 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	understand	it	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	 constant 	 ly 	 	in	the	writing	.
and	there	's	the	 terr 	 ible 	 	and	 dread 	 ed 	 	 observ 	 er 	 	effect	,	in	which	you	're	looking	for	 some 	 thing 	 	,	and	you	know	,	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 happen 	 ing 	 	 simultaneous 	 ly 	 	,	and	you	're	looking	at	it	in	a	different	way	,	and	you	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 re 	 ally 	 	look	for	the	about	-	ness	,
or	what	is	 th 	 is 	 	story	about	.	and	if	you	try	too	hard	,	then	you	will	 on 	 ly 	 	write	the	about	.
you	wo	n't	discover	 any 	 thing 	 	.
and	what	you	 we 	 re 	 	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	find	,	what	you	 hop 	 ed 	 	to	find	in	some	serendipitous	way	,	is	no	 long 	 er 	 	there	.
now	,	i	do	n't	want	to	 ignor 	 e 	 	the	other	side	of	what	 happen 	 s 	 	in	our	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	like	 man 	 y 	 	of	our	 scientist 	 s 	 	have	.
and	so	,	i	am	going	to	just	throw	in	string	 theor 	 y 	 	here	,	and	just	say	that	creative	people	are	 multi 	 dimensional 	 	,	and	there	are	11	 level 	 s 	 	,	i	think	,	of	 anxie 	 ty 	 	.
and	they	all	 oper 	 ate 	 	at	the	same	time	.
there	is	 al 	 so 	 	a	big	question	of	 ambigu 	 ity 	 	.
and	i	would	link	that	to	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 cosmo 	 logical 	 	constant	.
and	you	do	n't	know	what	is	 oper 	 ating 	 	,	but	 some 	 thing 	 	is	 oper 	 ating 	 	there	.
and	 ambigu 	 ity 	 	,	to	me	,	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	in	my	life	,	and	i	have	it	.	moral	 ambigu 	 ity 	 	.
it	is	 constant 	 ly 	 	there	.	and	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	that	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	came	to	me	.
it	was	 some 	 thing 	 	i	read	in	an	 editor 	 ial 	 	by	a	woman	who	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	war	in	 ir 	 aq 	 	.	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 s 	 ave 	 	a	man	from	 drown 	 ing 	 	,	you	are	 respons 	 ible 	 	to	him	for	life	.	``
a	 ver 	 y 	 	famous	chinese	 say 	 ing 	 	,	she	 s 	 aid 	 	.
and	that	 mean 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	went	 in 	 to 	 	 ir 	 aq 	 	,	we	should	stay	there	 un 	 til 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 solve 	 d 	 	.	you	know	,	 may 	 be 	 	even	100	 year 	 s 	 	.
so	,	there	was	 an 	 other 	 	one	that	i	came	 a 	 cross 	 	,	and	it	's	``	saving	fish	from	 drown 	 ing 	 	.	``
and	it	's	what	buddhist	 fish 	 er 	 men 	 	say	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	not	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	kill	 any 	 thing 	 	.
and	they	 al 	 so 	 	have	to	make	a	living	,	and	people	need	to	be	fed	.
so	 the 	 ir 	 	way	of	 rational 	 izing 	 	that	is	they	are	saving	the	fish	from	 drown 	 ing 	 	,	and	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	in	the	process	the	fish	die	.
now	,	what	's	 encapsul 	 ated 	 	in	both	these	 drown 	 ing 	 	 metaphor 	 s 	 	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	one	of	them	is	my	mother	's	 interpret 	 ation 	 	,	and	it	is	a	famous	chinese	 say 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	she	 s 	 aid 	 	it	to	me	:	``	 s 	 ave 	 	a	man	from	 drown 	 ing 	 	,	you	are	 respons 	 ible 	 	to	him	for	life	.	``
and	it	was	a	 war 	 ning 	 	--	do	n't	get	 involve 	 d 	 	in	other	people	's	business	,	or	you	're	going	to	get	 s 	 tuck 	 	.
ok	.	i	think	if	 some 	 body 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	was	 drown 	 ing 	 	,	she	'd	 s 	 ave 	 	them	.
but	,	both	of	these	 say 	 ing 	 s 	 	--	saving	a	fish	from	 drown 	 ing 	 	,	or	saving	a	man	from	 drown 	 ing 	 	--	to	me	they	had	to	do	with	 intent 	 ions 	 	.
and	all	of	us	in	life	,	when	we	see	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	we	have	a	 respons 	 e 	 	.
and	then	we	have	 intent 	 ions 	 	.
there	's	an	 ambigu 	 ity 	 	of	what	that	should	be	that	we	should	do	,	and	then	we	do	 some 	 thing 	 	.
and	the	 result 	 s 	 	of	that	may	not	match	what	our	 intent 	 ions 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	go	wrong	.	and	so	,	after	that	,	what	are	our	 respons 	 ibilities 	 	?
what	are	we	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	do	?
do	we	stay	in	for	life	,	or	do	we	do	 some 	 thing 	 	else	and	 just 	 ify 	 	and	say	,	well	,	my	 intent 	 ions 	 	 we 	 re 	 	good	,	and	 there 	 fore 	 	i	can	not	be	held	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	all	of	it	?
that	is	the	 ambigu 	 ity 	 	in	my	life	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 disturb 	 ed 	 	me	,	and	led	me	to	write	a	book	 call 	 ed 	 	``	saving	fish	from	 drown 	 ing 	 	.	``
i	saw	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	that	.	once	i	identified	 th 	 is 	 	question	,	it	was	all	over	the	place	.
i	got	these	 hint 	 s 	 	 every 	 where 	 	.
and	then	,	in	a	way	,	i	 k 	 new 	 	that	they	had	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	there	.
and	then	writing	,	that	's	what	 happen 	 s 	 	.	i	get	these	 hint 	 s 	 	,	these	 clue 	 s 	 	,	and	i	 real 	 ize 	 	that	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	obvious	,	and	yet	they	have	not	 be 	 en 	 	.
and	what	i	need	,	in	effect	,	is	a	focus	.
and	when	i	have	the	question	,	it	is	a	focus	.
and	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	that	seem	to	be	flotsam	and	 jet 	 s 	 am 	 	in	life	 actual 	 ly 	 	go	through	that	question	,	and	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	 t 	 hose 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	relevant	.
and	it	 seem 	 s 	 	like	it	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	all	the	time	.
you	think	there	's	a	sort	of	 co 	 incidence 	 	going	on	,	a	 s 	 er 	 en 	 dip 	 ity 	 	,	in	which	you	're	 get 	 ting 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	help	from	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
and	it	may	 al 	 so 	 	be	 explain 	 ed 	 	that	now	you	have	a	focus	.
and	you	are	 not 	 ic 	 ing 	 	it	more	often	.
but	you	 app 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
you	begin	to	look	at	 thing 	 s 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	your	 tension 	 s 	 	.
your	brother	,	who	's	 fall 	 en 	 	in	trouble	,	do	you	take	care	of	him	?
why	or	why	not	?
it	may	be	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	more	serious	--	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	human	 right 	 s 	 	in	burma	.
i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	that	i	should	n't	go	 be 	 cause 	 	 some 	 body 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	if	i	did	,	it	would	show	that	i	approved	of	the	 militar 	 y 	 	regime	there	.
and	then	,	after	a	while	,	i	had	to	ask	 my 	 self 	 	,	``	why	do	we	take	on	knowledge	,	why	do	we	take	on	 assumption 	 s 	 	that	other	people	have	 give 	 n 	 	us	?	``
and	it	was	the	same	thing	that	i	felt	when	i	was	growing	up	,	and	was	 hear 	 ing 	 	these	 rule 	 s 	 	of	moral	conduct	from	my	father	,	who	was	a	baptist	 mini 	 ster 	 	.
so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	that	i	would	go	to	burma	for	my	own	 intent 	 ions 	 	,	and	still	did	n't	know	that	if	i	went	there	,	what	the	result	of	that	would	be	,	if	i	wrote	a	book	--	and	i	just	would	have	to	face	that	 lat 	 er 	 	,	when	the	time	came	.
we	are	all	 concern 	 ed 	 	with	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	see	in	the	world	that	we	are	aware	of	.
we	come	to	 th 	 is 	 	point	and	say	,	what	do	i	 a 	 s 	 	an	individual	do	?
not	all	of	us	can	go	to	africa	,	or	work	at	 hospital 	 s 	 	,	so	what	do	we	do	,	if	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	moral	 respons 	 e 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	?
 al 	 so 	 	,	i	think	one	of	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	we	are	all	looking	at	,	and	we	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	 to 	 day 	 	,	is	genocide	.
 th 	 is 	 	 lead 	 s 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	question	.	when	i	look	at	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 moral 	 ly 	 	 ambigu 	 ous 	 	and	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	,	and	i	consider	what	my	 intent 	 ions 	 	should	be	,	i	 real 	 ize 	 	it	 go 	 es 	 	back	to	 th 	 is 	 	 ident 	 ity 	 	question	that	i	had	when	i	was	a	child	--	and	why	am	i	here	,	and	what	is	the	meaning	of	my	life	,	and	what	is	my	place	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	?
it	 seem 	 s 	 	so	obvious	,	and	yet	it	is	not	.
we	all	hate	moral	 ambigu 	 ity 	 	in	some	sense	,	and	yet	it	is	 al 	 so 	 	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 necess 	 ary 	 	.
in	writing	a	story	,	it	is	the	place	where	i	begin	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	i	get	help	from	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	it	 seem 	 s 	 	.
my	mother	would	say	it	was	the	ghost	of	my	 grand 	 mother 	 	from	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	book	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 seem 	 ed 	 	i	 k 	 new 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	i	was	not	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	know	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	writing	that	the	 grand 	 mother 	 	 di 	 ed 	 	 accident 	 ally 	 	,	from	an	 over 	 dose 	 	of	 op 	 ium 	 	,	while	 hav 	 ing 	 	too	much	of	a	good	time	,	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	put	down	in	the	story	that	the	woman	 kill 	 ed 	 	 her 	 self 	 	,	and	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	was	the	way	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
and	my	mother	 decide 	 d 	 	that	that	information	must	have	come	from	my	 grand 	 mother 	 	.
there	are	 al 	 so 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 quit 	 e 	 	 un 	 can 	 ny 	 	,	which	 br 	 ing 	 	me	information	that	will	help	me	in	the	writing	of	the	book	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	i	was	writing	a	story	that	 include 	 d 	 	some	kind	of	detail	,	period	of	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	a	certain	location	.
and	i	 need 	 ed 	 	to	find	 some 	 thing 	 	 historic 	 ally 	 	that	would	match	that	.
and	i	took	down	 th 	 is 	 	book	,	and	i	--
first	page	that	i	 flip 	 ped 	 	it	to	was	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	setting	,	and	the	time	period	,
and	the	kind	of	character	i	 need 	 ed 	 	--	was	the	taiping	 rebel 	 lion 	 	,	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	the	area	near	guilin	,	 out 	 side 	 	of	that	,	and	a	character	who	thought	he	was	the	son	of	god	.
you	wonder	,	are	these	 thing 	 s 	 	random	chance	?
well	,	what	is	random	?	what	is	chance	?	what	is	luck	?
what	are	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	get	from	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	that	you	ca	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	explain	?
and	that	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	story	,	too	.
these	are	the	 thing 	 s 	 	i	 constant 	 ly 	 	think	about	from	day	to	day	.
 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	when	good	 thing 	 s 	 	happen	,	and	,	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	when	bad	 thing 	 s 	 	happen	.
but	i	do	think	there	's	a	kind	of	 s 	 er 	 en 	 dip 	 ity 	 	,	and	i	do	want	to	know	what	 t 	 hose 	 	 element 	 s 	 	are	,	so	i	can	thank	them	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	try	to	find	them	in	my	life	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	i	think	that	when	i	am	aware	of	them	,	more	of	them	happen	.
 an 	 other 	 	chance	 en 	 counter 	 	is	when	i	went	to	a	place	--	i	just	was	with	some	 friend 	 s 	 	,	and	we	drove	 random 	 ly 	 	to	a	different	place	,	and	we	 end 	 ed 	 	up	in	 th 	 is 	 	non	-	tourist	location	,	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	village	,	 pr 	 ist 	 ine 	 	.
and	we	 walk 	 ed 	 	three	 val 	 ley 	 s 	 	beyond	,	and	the	third	 val 	 ley 	 	,	there	was	 some 	 thing 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 myster 	 ious 	 	and	ominous	,	a	 dis 	 comfort 	 	i	felt	.	and	then	i	 k 	 new 	 	that	had	to	be	[	the	]	setting	of	my	book	.
and	in	writing	one	of	the	 scene 	 s 	 	,	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	that	third	 val 	 ley 	 	.
for	some	reason	i	wrote	about	cairns	--	 stack 	 s 	 	of	 rock 	 s 	 	--	that	a	man	was	building	.
and	i	did	n't	know	 exact 	 ly 	 	why	i	had	it	,	but	it	was	so	 vivi 	 d 	 	.
i	got	 s 	 tuck 	 	,	and	a	friend	,	when	she	 ask 	 ed 	 	if	i	would	go	for	a	walk	with	her	 dog 	 s 	 	,	that	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 s 	 ure 	 	.	and	about	45	 minute 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	 walk 	 ing 	 	 a 	 long 	 	the	beach	,	i	came	 a 	 cross 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	it	was	a	man	,	a	chinese	man	,	and	he	was	 stack 	 ing 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	not	with	glue	,	not	with	 any 	 thing 	 	.
and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	him	,	``	how	is	it	possible	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	?	``
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	i	guess	with	 every 	 thing 	 	in	life	,	there	's	a	place	of	balance	.	``
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	meaning	of	my	story	at	that	point	.
i	had	so	 man 	 y 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	--	i	have	so	 man 	 y 	 	 in 	 stance 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	when	i	'm	writing	a	story	,	and	i	can	not	explain	it	.
is	it	 be 	 cause 	 	i	had	the	filter	that	i	have	 s 	 uch 	 	a	strong	 co 	 incidence 	 	in	writing	about	these	 thing 	 s 	 	?
or	is	it	a	kind	of	 s 	 er 	 en 	 dip 	 ity 	 	that	we	can	not	explain	,	like	the	 cosmo 	 logical 	 	constant	?
a	big	thing	that	i	 al 	 so 	 	think	about	is	 accident 	 s 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	my	mother	did	not	 believ 	 e 	 	in	 random 	 ness 	 	.
what	is	the	nature	of	 accident 	 s 	 	?
and	how	are	we	going	to	assign	what	the	 respons 	 ibility 	 	and	the	 cause 	 s 	 	are	,	 out 	 side 	 	of	a	court	of	law	?
i	was	able	to	see	that	in	a	 first 	 hand 	 	way	,	when	i	went	to	 beaut 	 iful 	 	dong	village	,	in	guizhou	,	the	 poor 	 est 	 	 pro 	 vince 	 	of	 chin 	 a 	 	.
and	i	saw	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	place	.	i	 k 	 new 	 	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	come	back	.
and	i	had	a	chance	to	do	that	,	when	national	 geo 	 graphic 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	if	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	write	 any 	 thing 	 	about	 chin 	 a 	 	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	 y 	 es 	 	,	about	 th 	 is 	 	village	of	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	people	,	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	 minor 	 ity 	 	.
and	they	 agree 	 d 	 	,	and	between	the	time	i	saw	 th 	 is 	 	place	and	the	next	time	i	went	,	there	was	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	accident	.	a	man	,	an	old	man	,	fell	 a 	 sleep 	 	,	and	his	quilt	 drop 	 ped 	 	in	a	pan	of	fire	that	 ke 	 pt 	 	him	warm	.
60	 home 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 destroy 	 ed 	 	,	and	40	 we 	 re 	 	 damage 	 d 	 	.
 respons 	 ibility 	 	was	 assign 	 ed 	 	to	the	family	.
the	man	's	 son 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 banish 	 ed 	 	to	live	three	 kilometer 	 s 	 	away	,	in	a	 cow 	 shed 	 	.
and	,	of	course	,	 a 	 s 	 	westerners	,	we	say	,	``	well	,	it	was	an	accident	.	that	's	not	fair	.
it	's	the	son	,	not	the	father	.	``
when	i	go	on	a	story	,	i	have	to	let	go	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 belief 	 s 	 	.
it	 take 	 s 	 	a	while	,	but	i	have	to	let	go	of	them	and	just	go	there	,	and	be	there	.
and	so	i	was	there	on	three	 occasion 	 s 	 	,	different	 season 	 s 	 	.
and	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	sense	 some 	 thing 	 	different	about	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	and	what	had	 happen 	 ed 	 	before	,	and	the	nature	of	life	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	poor	village	,	and	what	you	find	 a 	 s 	 	your	 joy 	 s 	 	,	and	your	 ritual 	 s 	 	,	your	 tradition 	 s 	 	,	your	 link 	 s 	 	with	other	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	.	and	i	saw	how	 th 	 is 	 	had	a	kind	of	justice	,	in	 it 	 s 	 	 respons 	 ibility 	 	.
i	was	able	to	find	out	 al 	 so 	 	about	the	 ce 	 re 	 mon 	 y 	 	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	using	,	a	 ce 	 re 	 mon 	 y 	 	they	had	n't	used	in	about	29	 year 	 s 	 	.	and	it	was	to	 s 	 end 	 	some	men	--	a	 fe 	 ng 	 	shui	master	 s 	 ent 	 	men	down	to	the	 under 	 world 	 	on	ghost	 horse 	 s 	 	.
now	you	,	 a 	 s 	 	westerners	,	and	i	,	 a 	 s 	 	westerners	,	would	say	well	,	that	's	 super 	 st 	 ition 	 	.	but	after	 be 	 ing 	 	there	for	a	while	,	and	 see 	 ing 	 	the	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	you	begin	to	wonder	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 belief 	 s 	 	are	 t 	 hose 	 	that	are	in	operation	in	the	world	,	 determi 	 ning 	 	how	 thing 	 s 	 	happen	.
so	i	 remain 	 ed 	 	with	them	,	and	the	more	i	wrote	that	story	,	the	more	i	got	 in 	 to 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 belief 	 s 	 	,	and	i	think	that	's	 import 	 ant 	 	for	me	--	to	take	on	the	 belief 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	is	where	the	story	is	real	,	and	that	is	where	i	'm	gon	na	find	the	 answer 	 s 	 	to	how	i	feel	about	certain	 question 	 s 	 	that	i	have	in	life	.
 year 	 s 	 	go	by	,	of	course	,	and	the	writing	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	happen	 instant 	 ly 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	convey	it	to	you	here	at	ted	.
the	book	 come 	 s 	 	and	it	 go 	 es 	 	.	when	it	 arriv 	 es 	 	,	it	is	no	 long 	 er 	 	my	book	.
it	is	in	the	 hand 	 s 	 	of	 read 	 ers 	 	,	and	they	interpret	it	 different 	 ly 	 	.
but	i	go	back	to	 th 	 is 	 	question	of	,	how	do	i	create	 some 	 thing 	 	out	of	 noth 	 ing 	 	?
and	how	do	i	create	my	own	life	?
and	i	think	it	is	by	 question 	 ing 	 	,	and	 say 	 ing 	 	to	 my 	 self 	 	that	there	are	no	absolute	 truth 	 s 	 	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	in	 specific 	 s 	 	,	the	 specific 	 s 	 	of	story	,	and	the	past	,	the	 specific 	 s 	 	of	that	past	,	and	what	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	the	story	at	that	point	.
i	 al 	 so 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	in	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 thing 	 s 	 	--	my	 think 	 ing 	 	about	luck	,	and	fate	,	and	 co 	 incidence 	 s 	 	and	 accident 	 s 	 	,	god	's	will	,	and	the	 synchron 	 y 	 	of	 myster 	 ious 	 	 force 	 s 	 	--	i	will	come	to	some	 not 	 ion 	 	of	what	that	is	,	how	we	create	.
i	have	to	think	of	my	role	.	where	i	am	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	and	did	 some 	 body 	 	intend	for	me	to	be	that	way	,	or	is	it	just	 some 	 thing 	 	i	came	up	with	?
and	i	 al 	 so 	 	can	find	that	by	 imagin 	 ing 	 	fully	,	and	 be 	 coming 	 	what	is	 imagin 	 ed 	 	--	and	yet	is	in	that	real	world	,	the	 fiction 	 al 	 	world	.
and	that	is	how	i	find	 particle 	 s 	 	of	truth	,	not	the	absolute	truth	,	or	the	whole	truth	.
and	they	have	to	be	in	all	 possibil 	 ities 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	i	never	 consider 	 ed 	 	before	.
so	,	there	are	never	complete	 answer 	 s 	 	.
or	 ra 	 ther 	 	,	if	there	is	an	answer	,	it	is	to	 re 	 mind 	 	 my 	 self 	 	that	there	is	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	in	 every 	 thing 	 	,	and	that	is	good	,	 be 	 cause 	 	then	i	will	discover	 some 	 thing 	 	new	.
and	if	there	is	a	partial	answer	,	a	more	complete	answer	from	me	,	it	is	to	 simpl 	 y 	 	imagine	.
and	to	imagine	is	to	put	 my 	 self 	 	in	that	story	,	 un 	 til 	 	there	was	 on 	 ly 	 	--	there	is	a	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	between	me	and	the	story	that	i	am	creating	.
and	that	's	how	i	've	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	if	i	feel	what	is	in	the	story	--	in	one	story	--	then	i	come	the	 close 	 st 	 	,	i	think	,	to	 know 	 ing 	 	what	 compass 	 ion 	 	is	,	to	 feel 	 ing 	 	that	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	for	 every 	 thing 	 	,	in	that	question	of	how	 thing 	 s 	 	happen	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	with	the	 feel 	 ing 	 	.
i	have	to	 be 	 come 	 	the	story	in	order	to	understand	a	lot	of	that	.
we	've	come	to	the	end	of	the	talk	,	and	i	will	reveal	what	is	in	the	bag	,	and	it	is	the	muse	,	and	it	is	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	transform	in	our	 live 	 s 	 	,	that	are	 wonder 	 ful 	 	and	stay	with	us	.
there	she	is	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	!
