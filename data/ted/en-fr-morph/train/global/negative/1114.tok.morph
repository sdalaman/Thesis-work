i	have	 s 	 pent 	 	the	past	few	 year 	 s 	 	 put 	 ting 	 	 my 	 self 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 situ 	 ations 	 	that	are	 usual 	 ly 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	and	at	the	same	time	 some 	 what 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
i	went	to	 pri 	 son 	 	--	difficult	.
i	 work 	 ed 	 	in	a	coal	mine	--	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
i	 film 	 ed 	 	in	war	 zone 	 s 	 	--	difficult	and	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
and	i	 s 	 pent 	 	30	 day 	 s 	 	eating	 noth 	 ing 	 	but	 th 	 is 	 	--	 f 	 un 	 	in	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	little	difficult	in	the	middle	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	in	the	end	.
in	fact	,	most	of	my	 care 	 er 	 	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 immers 	 ing 	 	 my 	 self 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 seem 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 horr 	 ible 	 	 situ 	 ations 	 	for	the	whole	goal	of	 try 	 ing 	 	to	examine	 socie 	 tal 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	in	a	way	that	make	them	 engag 	 ing 	 	,	that	make	them	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	that	 hope 	 fully 	 	break	them	down	in	a	way	that	make	them	 entertain 	 ing 	 	and	 access 	 ible 	 	to	an	audience	.
so	when	i	 k 	 new 	 	i	was	coming	here	to	do	a	ted	talk	that	was	going	to	look	at	the	world	of	 brand 	 ing 	 	and	 sponsor 	 ship 	 	,	i	 k 	 new 	 	i	would	want	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	a	little	different	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	some	of	you	may	or	may	not	have	heard	,	a	couple	 week 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	took	out	an	ad	on	ebay	.
i	 s 	 ent 	 	out	some	facebook	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	,	some	twitter	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	,	and	i	 g 	 ave 	 	people	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	buy	the	 na 	 ming 	 	 right 	 s 	 	to	my	2011	ted	talk	.
that	's	right	,	some	 luck 	 y 	 	individual	,	corporation	,	for	-	profit	or	non	-	profit	,	was	going	to	get	the	once	-	in	-	a	-	 life 	 time 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	chris	anderson	will	never	let	it	happen	 aga 	 in 	 	--	to	buy	the	 na 	 ming 	 	 right 	 s 	 	to	the	talk	you	're	 watch 	 ing 	 	right	now	,	that	at	the	time	did	n't	have	a	title	,	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	have	a	lot	of	content	and	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	give	much	hint	 a 	 s 	 	to	what	the	subject	matter	would	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	.
so	what	you	 we 	 re 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	was	 th 	 is 	 	:	your	name	here	 present 	 s 	 	:	my	ted	talk	that	you	have	no	idea	what	the	subject	is	and	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	the	content	,	could	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	blow	up	in	your	face	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	if	i	make	you	or	your	company	look	stupid	for	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
but	that	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	media	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
you	know	how	 man 	 y 	 	people	watch	these	ted	 talk 	 s 	 	?
it	's	a	lot	.
that	's	just	a	 work 	 ing 	 	title	,	by	the	way	.
so	even	with	that	 cave 	 at 	 	,	i	 k 	 new 	 	that	 some 	 one 	 	would	buy	the	 na 	 ming 	 	 right 	 s 	 	.
now	if	you	'd	have	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	that	a	year	ago	,	i	would	n't	have	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	tell	you	that	with	any	 certain 	 ty 	 	.
but	in	the	new	project	that	i	'm	 work 	 ing 	 	on	,	my	new	film	,	we	examine	the	world	of	 market 	 ing 	 	,	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	,	i	put	 my 	 self 	 	in	some	 pre 	 tty 	 	 horr 	 ible 	 	 situ 	 ations 	 	over	the	 year 	 s 	 	,	but	 noth 	 ing 	 	could	 prep 	 are 	 	me	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	could	ready	me	,	for	 any 	 thing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	difficult	or	 a 	 s 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	 a 	 s 	 	going	 in 	 to 	 	the	rooms	with	these	 guy 	 s 	 	.
you	see	,	i	had	 th 	 is 	 	idea	for	a	movie	.
morgan	spurlock	:	what	i	want	to	do	is	make	a	film	all	about	product	placement	,	 market 	 ing 	 	and	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	,	where	the	entire	film	is	funded	by	product	placement	,	 market 	 ing 	 	and	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	.
so	the	movie	will	be	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	 great 	 est 	 	movie	ever	 s 	 old 	 	.	``	so	what	 happen 	 s 	 	in	``	the	 great 	 est 	 	movie	ever	 s 	 old 	 	,	``	is	that	 every 	 thing 	 	from	top	to	bottom	,	from	start	to	finish	,	is	 brand 	 ed 	 	from	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	end	--	from	the	above	-	the	-	title	sponsor	that	you	'll	see	in	the	movie	,	which	is	brand	x	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	brand	,	the	qualcomm	 stad 	 ium 	 	,	the	 staple 	 s 	 	center	...
these	people	will	be	married	to	the	film	in	 perpetu 	 ity 	 	--	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
and	so	the	film	 explore 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	whole	idea	--	it	's	what	?	in	 perpetu 	 ity 	 	,	 fore 	 ver 	 	?
i	'm	a	 red 	 un 	 d 	 ant 	 	person	.
that	was	more	for	 emphas 	 is 	 	.
it	was	,	``	in	 perpetu 	 ity 	 	.	 fore 	 ver 	 	.	``
but	not	 on 	 ly 	 	are	we	going	to	have	the	brand	x	title	sponsor	,	but	we	're	going	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	we	sell	out	every	 categor 	 y 	 	we	can	in	the	film	.
so	 may 	 be 	 	we	sell	a	shoe	and	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	the	 great 	 est 	 	shoe	you	ever	 wo 	 re 	 	...
the	 great 	 est 	 	car	you	ever	drove	from	``	the	 great 	 est 	 	movie	ever	 s 	 old 	 	,	``	the	 great 	 est 	 	drink	you	've	ever	had	,	 court 	 es 	 y 	 	of	``	the	 great 	 est 	 	movie	ever	 s 	 old 	 	.	``
_UNK_	_UNK_	:	so	the	idea	is	,	beyond	just	 show 	 ing 	 	that	 brand 	 s 	 	are	a	part	of	your	life	,	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	them	to	finance	the	film	?
ms	:	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	we	show	the	whole	process	of	how	 do 	 es 	 	it	work	.
the	goal	of	 th 	 is 	 	whole	film	is	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	.
you	're	going	to	see	the	whole	thing	take	place	in	 th 	 is 	 	movie	.
so	that	's	the	whole	 con 	 cept 	 	,	the	whole	film	,	start	to	finish	.
and	i	would	love	for	_UNK_	to	help	make	it	happen	.
robert	friedman	:	you	know	it	's	funny	,	 be 	 cause 	 	when	i	first	hear	it	,	it	is	the	ultimate	respect	for	an	audience	.

john	kamen	:	i	think	that	you	're	going	to	have	a	hard	time	 meet 	 ing 	 	with	them	,	but	i	think	it	's	 certain 	 ly 	 	worth	 pur 	 suing 	 	a	couple	big	,	 re 	 ally 	 	obvious	 brand 	 s 	 	.

 non 	 e 	 	of	them	 want 	 ed 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	to	do	with	 th 	 is 	 	movie	.

they	 want 	 ed 	 	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	 th 	 is 	 	project	.
and	i	was	blown	away	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	thought	the	whole	 con 	 cept 	 	,	the	idea	of	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	,	was	to	get	your	product	out	in	front	of	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	 a 	 s 	 	possible	,	to	get	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	to	see	it	 a 	 s 	 	possible	.
 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	in	 to 	 day 	 	's	world	,	 th 	 is 	 	 intersect 	 ion 	 	of	new	media	and	old	media	and	the	 fracture 	 d 	 	media	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	,	is	n't	the	idea	to	get	that	new	buzz	-	worthy	 deliver 	 y 	 	vehicle	that	's	going	to	get	that	 mess 	 age 	 	to	the	 masse 	 s 	 	?
no	,	that	's	what	i	thought	.
but	the	problem	was	,	you	see	,	my	idea	had	one	fatal	flaw	,	and	that	flaw	was	 th 	 is 	 	.	 actual 	 ly 	 	no	,	that	was	not	the	flaw	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	.
that	would	n't	have	 be 	 en 	 	a	problem	at	all	.
 th 	 is 	 	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	fine	.
but	what	 th 	 is 	 	image	 represent 	 s 	 	was	the	problem	.
see	,	when	you	do	a	google	image	search	for	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	--	-	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	first	 image 	 s 	 	that	 come 	 s 	 	up	.
so	i	like	the	way	you	roll	,	sergey	brin	.	no	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	was	the	problem	:	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	--	free	from	 pre 	 tense 	 	or	deceit	;	 eas 	 ily 	 	 detect 	 ed 	 	or	 s 	 een 	 	through	;	 read 	 ily 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	;	 character 	 ized 	 	by	 vis 	 ibility 	 	or	 access 	 ibility 	 	of	information	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 concern 	 ing 	 	business	 practice 	 s 	 	--	that	last	line	 be 	 ing 	 	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	 big 	 gest 	 	problem	.
you	see	,	we	hear	a	lot	about	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	these	 day 	 s 	 	.
our	 politic 	 ians 	 	say	it	,	our	 p 	 resident 	 	 say 	 s 	 	it	,	even	our	ceo	's	say	it	.

but	why	?	well	,	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	is	 scar 	 y 	 	--	like	that	odd	,	still	-	 s 	 cream 	 ing 	 	bear	.
it	's	 un 	 predict 	 able 	 	--	like	 th 	 is 	 	odd	country	road	.
and	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 risk 	 y 	 	.
what	else	is	 risk 	 y 	 	?
eating	an	entire	bowl	of	cool	whip	.

now	when	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	and	 tell 	 ing 	 	them	that	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	tell	 th 	 is 	 	story	,	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	we	want	you	to	tell	a	story	.
we	want	you	to	tell	a	story	,	but	we	just	want	to	tell	our	story	.	``	see	,	when	i	was	a	kid	and	my	father	would	catch	me	in	some	sort	of	a	lie	--	and	there	he	is	giving	me	the	look	he	often	 g 	 ave 	 	me	--	he	would	say	,	``	son	,	there	's	three	 side 	 s 	 	to	every	story	.

and	so	i	found	a	company	 call 	 ed 	 	olson	zaltman	in	_UNK_	.
they	've	 help 	 ed 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	like	_UNK_	,	_UNK_	,	 hall 	 mark 	 	discover	that	brand	 personal 	 ity 	 	.
if	they	could	do	it	for	them	,	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	they	could	do	it	for	me	.
abigail	:	you	 br 	 ought 	 	your	 picture 	 s 	 	,	right	?
ms	:	i	did	.	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	picture	is	a	picture	of	my	family	.
a	:	so	tell	me	a	little	bit	how	it	 relat 	 es 	 	to	your	 thought 	 s 	 	and	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	about	who	you	are	.
ms	:	these	are	the	people	who	shape	the	way	i	look	at	the	world	.
a	:	tell	me	about	 th 	 is 	 	world	.
ms	:	 th 	 is 	 	world	?	i	think	your	world	is	the	world	that	you	live	in	--	like	people	who	are	around	you	,	your	 friend 	 s 	 	,	your	family	,	the	way	you	live	your	life	,	the	job	you	do	.
all	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 stem 	 med 	 	and	 start 	 ed 	 	from	one	place	,	and	for	me	they	 stem 	 med 	 	and	 start 	 ed 	 	with	my	family	in	west	virginia	.
a	:	what	's	the	next	one	you	want	to	talk	about	?
ms	:	the	next	one	:	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	best	day	ever	.
a	:	how	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 late 	 	to	your	 thought 	 s 	 	and	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	about	who	you	are	?
ms	:	it	's	like	,	who	do	i	want	to	be	?
i	like	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	different	.
i	like	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	weird	.	i	like	weird	 thing 	 s 	 	.
a	:	tell	me	about	the	``	why	``	phase	--	what	 do 	 es 	 	that	do	for	us	?
what	is	the	machete	?	what	pupa	stage	are	you	in	now	?
why	is	it	 import 	 ant 	 	to	 re 	 boot 	 	?	what	 do 	 es 	 	the	red	represent	?
tell	me	a	little	bit	about	that	part	.
...	a	little	more	about	you	that	is	not	who	you	are	.
what	are	some	other	_UNK_	that	you	've	had	?
...	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	to	be	fear	.	what	kind	of	roller	 coast 	 er 	 	are	you	on	?
ms	:	_UNK_	!	no	,	thank	you	.
a	:	 thank 	 s 	 	for	you	patience	.
a	:	 yea 	 h 	 	.	all	right	.
ms	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	i	do	n't	know	what	's	going	to	come	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
there	was	a	whole	lot	of	crazy	going	on	in	there	.
_UNK_	zaltman	:	the	first	thing	we	saw	was	 th 	 is 	 	idea	that	you	had	two	distinct	,	but	 comple 	 ment 	 ary 	 	 side 	 s 	 	to	your	brand	 personal 	 ity 	 	--	the	morgan	spurlock	brand	is	a	 mind 	 ful 	 	/	play	brand	.
 t 	 hose 	 	are	 juxta 	 posed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 nice 	 ly 	 	together	.
and	i	think	there	's	 al 	 most 	 	a	paradox	with	 t 	 hose 	 	.
and	i	think	some	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	will	just	focus	on	one	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 strength 	 s 	 	or	the	other	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 focus 	 ing 	 	on	both	.
most	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	tend	to	--	and	it	's	human	nature	--	to	avoid	 thing 	 s 	 	that	they	're	not	 s 	 ure 	 	of	,	avoid	fear	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 element 	 s 	 	,	and	you	 re 	 ally 	 	embrace	 t 	 hose 	 	,	and	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	turn	them	 in 	 to 	 	 positive 	 s 	 	for	you	,	and	it	's	a	neat	thing	to	see	.
what	other	 brand 	 s 	 	are	like	that	?
the	first	on	here	is	the	classic	,	apple	.
and	you	can	see	here	too	,	target	,	wii	,	mini	from	the	mini	_UNK_	,	and	_UNK_	.
now	there	's	 play 	 ful 	 	 brand 	 s 	 	and	 mind 	 ful 	 	 brand 	 s 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	have	come	and	gone	,	but	a	 play 	 ful 	 	,	 mind 	 ful 	 	brand	is	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	thing	.
ms	:	a	 play 	 ful 	 	,	 mind 	 ful 	 	brand	.	what	is	your	brand	?
if	 some 	 body 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	you	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	your	brand	 ident 	 ity 	 	,	your	brand	 personal 	 ity 	 	,	what	would	you	be	?
are	you	an	up	 attribut 	 e 	 	?	are	you	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 get 	 s 	 	the	blood	 flow 	 ing 	 	?
or	are	you	more	of	a	down	 attribut 	 e 	 	?
are	you	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	a	little	more	calm	,	 re 	 serv 	 ed 	 	,	 conserv 	 ative 	 	?
up	 attribut 	 es 	 	are	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 be 	 ing 	 	 play 	 ful 	 	,	 be 	 ing 	 	fresh	like	the	fresh	prince	,	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	,	 ad 	 vent 	 ur 	 ous 	 	,	edgy	or	 da 	 ring 	 	like	_UNK_	_UNK_	,	nimble	or	 ag 	 ile 	 	,	 profan 	 e 	 	,	 domin 	 eer 	 ing 	 	,	 magic 	 al 	 	or	 mystic 	 al 	 	like	gandalf	.
or	are	you	more	of	a	down	 attribut 	 e 	 	?
are	you	 mind 	 ful 	 	,	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	like	_UNK_	?
are	you	 establish 	 ed 	 	,	 tradition 	 al 	 	,	 nurtur 	 ing 	 	,	 protect 	 ive 	 	,	 em 	 pathetic 	 	like	the	oprah	?
are	you	 reli 	 able 	 	,	 s 	 table 	 	,	familiar	,	safe	,	secure	,	sacred	,	 contempl 	 ative 	 	or	wise	like	the	dalai	lama	or	yoda	?
over	the	course	of	 th 	 is 	 	film	,	we	had	500	-	plus	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	up	and	down	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	no	,	``	they	did	n't	want	any	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	project	.
they	 want 	 ed 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	 th 	 is 	 	film	,	 main 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	would	have	no	control	,	they	would	have	no	control	over	the	final	product	.
but	we	did	get	17	brand	 partner 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	 will 	 ing 	 	to	relinquish	that	control	,	who	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	in	business	with	 some 	 one 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 mind 	 ful 	 	and	 a 	 s 	 	 play 	 ful 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 my 	 self 	 	and	who	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	 empower 	 ed 	 	us	to	tell	 st 	 ories 	 	that	 normal 	 ly 	 	we	would	n't	be	able	to	tell	--	 st 	 ories 	 	that	an	_UNK_	would	 normal 	 ly 	 	never	get	 be 	 hind 	 	.
they	enabled	us	to	tell	the	story	about	_UNK_	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	got	 in 	 to 	 	 tell 	 ing 	 	the	story	in	 th 	 is 	 	film	about	how	now	they	're	using	mri	's	to	target	the	 desir 	 e 	 	 center 	 s 	 	of	your	brain	for	both	 commercial 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	movie	 market 	 ing 	 	.
we	went	to	san	paulo	where	they	have	 bann 	 ed 	 	 out 	 door 	 	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	.
in	the	entire	city	for	the	past	five	 year 	 s 	 	,	there	's	no	 bill 	 board 	 s 	 	,	there	's	no	 post 	 ers 	 	,	there	's	no	 fli 	 ers 	 	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
and	we	went	to	school	 di 	 strict 	 s 	 	where	now	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	are	making	 the 	 ir 	 	way	 in 	 to 	 	cash	-	 s 	 trapped 	 	 school 	 s 	 	all	 a 	 cross 	 	america	.
what	's	 in 	 credible 	 	for	me	is	the	 project 	 s 	 	that	i	've	gotten	the	most	 feed 	 back 	 	out	of	,	or	i	've	had	the	most	success	in	,	are	 one 	 s 	 	where	i	've	 interact 	 ed 	 	with	 thing 	 s 	 	 direct 	 ly 	 	.
and	that	's	what	these	 brand 	 s 	 	did	.
they	cut	out	the	 middle 	 man 	 	,	they	cut	out	 the 	 ir 	 	 age 	 ncies 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 may 	 be 	 	these	 age 	 ncies 	 	do	n't	have	my	best	interest	in	mind	.
i	'm	going	to	deal	 direct 	 ly 	 	with	the	artist	.
i	'm	going	to	work	with	him	to	create	 some 	 thing 	 	different	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	going	to	get	people	 think 	 ing 	 	,	that	's	going	to	 challeng 	 e 	 	the	way	we	look	at	the	world	.	``
and	how	 ha 	 s 	 	that	 be 	 en 	 	for	them	?	 ha 	 s 	 	it	 be 	 en 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	?
well	,	since	the	film	 premiere 	 d 	 	at	the	sundance	film	 fest 	 ival 	 	,	let	's	take	a	look	.
 accord 	 ing 	 	to	_UNK_	,	the	movie	 premiere 	 d 	 	in	january	,	and	since	then	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	even	the	whole	thing	--	we	've	had	900	million	media	 impression 	 s 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	film	.
that	's	 liter 	 ally 	 	 cover 	 ing 	 	just	like	a	two	and	a	half	-	week	period	.
that	's	 on 	 ly 	 	 on 	 line 	 	--	no	print	,	no	tv	.
the	film	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	even	 be 	 en 	 	 distribut 	 ed 	 	yet	.
it	's	not	even	 on 	 line 	 	.	it	's	not	even	 stream 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	not	even	 be 	 en 	 	out	 in 	 to 	 	other	foreign	 count 	 ries 	 	yet	.
so	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	film	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	to	gain	a	lot	of	 moment 	 um 	 	.
and	not	bad	for	a	project	that	 al 	 most 	 	every	ad	 age 	 ncy 	 	we	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	 advise 	 d 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 client 	 s 	 	not	to	take	part	.
what	i	 al 	 ways 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	is	that	if	you	take	 chance 	 s 	 	,	if	you	take	 risk 	 s 	 	,	that	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 risk 	 s 	 	will	come	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	when	you	push	people	away	from	that	,	you	're	 push 	 ing 	 	them	more	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	failure	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	when	you	train	your	 employ 	 ees 	 	to	be	risk	 a 	 verse 	 	,	then	you	're	 pre 	 par 	 ing 	 	your	whole	company	to	be	reward	 challeng 	 ed 	 	.
i	feel	like	that	what	 ha 	 s 	 	to	happen	moving	forward	is	we	need	to	 encourag 	 e 	 	people	to	take	 risk 	 s 	 	.
we	need	to	 encourag 	 e 	 	people	to	not	be	 af 	 raid 	 	of	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	that	may	 s 	 care 	 	them	.
 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	moving	forward	,	i	think	we	have	to	embrace	fear	.
we	've	got	to	put	that	bear	in	a	cage	.
embrace	fear	.	embrace	risk	.
one	big	_UNK_	at	a	time	,	we	have	to	embrace	risk	.
and	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	we	have	to	embrace	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	more	than	ever	,	a	little	 honest 	 y 	 	is	going	to	go	a	long	way	.
and	that	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	through	 honest 	 y 	 	and	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	,	my	entire	talk	,	``	embrace	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	,	``	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	to	you	by	my	good	 friend 	 s 	 	at	emc	,	who	for	$	7,100	 b 	 ought 	 	the	 na 	 ming 	 	 right 	 s 	 	on	ebay	.
