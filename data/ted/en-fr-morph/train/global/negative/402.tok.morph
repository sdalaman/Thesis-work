welcome	to	10,000	feet	.
let	me	explain	why	we	are	here	and	why	some	of	you	have	a	pine	 con 	 e 	 	close	to	you	.
once	 up 	 on 	 	a	time	,	i	did	a	book	 call 	 ed 	 	``	how	 building 	 s 	 	learn	.	``
 to 	 day 	 	's	event	you	might	call	``	how	 mountain 	 s 	 	teach	.	``
a	little	 back 	 ground 	 	:	for	10	 year 	 s 	 	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	how	to	hack	 civil 	 ization 	 	so	that	we	can	get	long	-	term	 think 	 ing 	 	to	be	 autom 	 atic 	 	and	common	 in 	 stead 	 	of	difficult	and	rare	--	or	in	some	 case 	 s 	 	,	non	-	existent	.
it	would	be	 help 	 ful 	 	if	 human 	 ity 	 	got	 in 	 to 	 	the	habit	of	 think 	 ing 	 	of	the	now	not	just	 a 	 s 	 	next	week	or	next	quarter	,	but	you	know	,	next	10,000	 year 	 s 	 	and	the	last	10,000	 year 	 s 	 	--	 bas 	 ically 	 	 civil 	 ization 	 	's	story	so	far	.
so	we	have	the	long	now	 found 	 ation 	 	in	san	francisco	.
it	's	an	 incub 	 ator 	 	for	about	a	dozen	 project 	 s 	 	,	all	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	 continu 	 ity 	 	over	the	long	term	.
our	core	project	is	a	 ra 	 ther 	 	 ambit 	 ious 	 	 fol 	 ly 	 	--	i	suppose	,	a	 myth 	 ic 	 	 under 	 taking 	 	:	to	build	a	10,000	-	year	clock	that	can	 re 	 ally 	 	keep	good	time	for	that	long	a	period	.
and	the	design	 problem 	 s 	 	of	a	project	like	that	are	just	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 delic 	 ious 	 	.
go	to	the	clock	.	and	what	we	have	here	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	saw	here	three	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
it	's	the	first	 work 	 ing 	 	prototype	of	the	clock	.
it	's	about	nine	feet	high	.
designed	by	danny	hillis	and	alexander	rose	.	it	's	 present 	 ly 	 	in	london	,	and	is	 tick 	 ing 	 	away	 ver 	 y 	 	 de 	 liberate 	 ly 	 	at	the	science	museum	there	.
so	the	design	problem	for	 to 	 day 	 	is	going	to	be	,	how	do	you	house	an	 event 	 ual 	 	 monument 	 al 	 	clock	like	 th 	 is 	 	so	it	can	 re 	 ally 	 	tick	,	 s 	 ave 	 	time	 beaut 	 i 	 fully 	 	for	100	centuries	?
well	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	first	solution	.
alexander	rose	came	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	a	spiraloid	tower	with	 continu 	 ous 	 	sloping	 ramp 	 s 	 	.
and	it	 look 	 ed 	 	like	a	way	to	go	,	 un 	 til 	 	you	start	 think 	 ing 	 	about	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	deep	time	do	to	a	building	?
well	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	deep	time	 do 	 es 	 	to	a	building	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	parthenon	.	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	2,450	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	and	look	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	it	.
here	's	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	project	.	they	 re 	 ally 	 	 k 	 new 	 	it	'd	last	 fore 	 ver 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	'd	build	it	out	of	 absolute 	 ly 	 	huge	 stone 	 s 	 	.
and	now	it	's	a	pathetic	ruin	and	no	one	even	 know 	 s 	 	what	it	was	used	for	.
that	's	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	 building 	 s 	 	.	they	're	 vulner 	 able 	 	.
even	the	most	 dur 	 able 	 	and	intactable	 building 	 s 	 	,	like	the	 pyramid 	 s 	 	of	giza	,	are	in	bad	shape	when	you	look	up	close	.
they	've	 be 	 en 	 	 loot 	 ed 	 	 in 	 side 	 	and	out	.
and	they	're	built	to	protect	 thing 	 s 	 	but	they	do	n't	protect	 thing 	 s 	 	.
so	we	got	to	 think 	 ing 	 	,	if	you	ca	n't	put	 thing 	 s 	 	 safe 	 ly 	 	in	a	building	,	where	can	you	 safe 	 ly 	 	put	them	?	we	thought	,	ok	,	 under 	 ground 	 	.
how	about	 under 	 ground 	 	with	a	view	?
 under 	 ground 	 	in	a	place	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	solid	.
so	the	obvious	answer	was	,	we	need	a	mountain	.
you	do	n't	want	just	any	mountain	.
you	need	 absolute 	 ly 	 	the	right	mountain	if	you	're	going	to	have	a	clock	for	10,000	 year 	 s 	 	.
so	here	's	an	image	of	the	long	view	of	the	search	problem	.
and	we	got	to	 think 	 ing 	 	for	 vari 	 ous 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	it	ought	to	be	a	desert	mountain	,	so	we	got	looking	in	the	dry	 area 	 s 	 	of	the	 south 	 west 	 	.
we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	mesas	in	new	mexico	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	looking	at	dead	 volcan 	 o 	 es 	 	in	arizona	.
then	roger	kennedy	,	who	was	the	director	of	the	national	 park 	 s 	 	service	,	led	us	to	eastern	nevada	,	to	america	's	 new 	 est 	 	and	 old 	 est 	 	national	park	,	which	is	 call 	 ed 	 	great	basin	national	park	.
it	's	right	on	the	eastern	border	of	nevada	.
it	's	the	highest	range	in	the	state	--	over	13,000	feet	.
and	you	'll	notice	that	on	the	left	,	on	the	left	,	on	the	west	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	steep	,	and	on	the	right	it	's	gentle	.
 th 	 is 	 	place	is	remote	.	it	's	over	200	 mile 	 s 	 	from	any	major	city	.
it	's	 no 	 where 	 	near	any	 inter 	 state 	 	or	 rail 	 road 	 	.
and	it	's	--	the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	that	 go 	 es 	 	by	is	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	america	's	loneliest	 high 	 way 	 	,	u.s.	50	.
now	,	 in 	 side 	 	the	yellow	line	here	,	on	the	right	is	--	that	's	all	national	park	.
 in 	 side 	 	the	green	line	is	national	forest	.
and	then	over	to	the	left	is	bureau	of	land	management	land	and	some	private	land	.
now	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	that	two	-	mile	-	long	strip	right	in	the	middle	,	 th 	 is 	 	 vert 	 ical 	 	,	was	 avail 	 able 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	private	land	.
and	 thank 	 s 	 	to	jay	 walk 	 er 	 	who	was	here	and	mitch	kapor	who	was	here	,	who	 start 	 ed 	 	the	process	,	long	now	was	able	to	get	that	two	-	mile	-	long	strip	of	land	.
and	now	let	's	look	at	the	grand	truth	of	what	's	there	.
we	're	in	pole	canyon	,	looking	west	up	the	western	escarpment	of	mount	washington	,	which	is	11,600	feet	on	top	.
 t 	 hose 	 	white	 cliff 	 s 	 	are	a	dense	cambrian	 lime 	 stone 	 	.
that	's	a	2,000	-	foot	thick	 form 	 ation 	 	,	and	it	might	be	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	place	to	hide	a	clock	.
it	would	be	a	 pil 	 grim 	 age 	 	to	get	to	it	;	it	would	be	a	serious	 hik 	 e 	 	to	get	up	to	where	the	clock	is	.
so	last	june	,	the	long	now	board	,	some	staff	and	some	 donor 	 s 	 	and	 advisor 	 s 	 	,	made	a	two	-	week	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 	to	the	mountain	to	explore	it	and	investigate	,	one	,	if	it	's	the	right	mountain	,	and	two	,	if	it	's	the	right	mountain	,	how	it	might	 actual 	 ly 	 	work	for	us	.
now	danny	hillis	sort	of	 frame 	 d 	 	the	problem	.
he	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 theor 	 y 	 	of	how	the	 over 	 all 	 	clock	experience	should	work	.
it	's	what	he	 call 	 s 	 	the	seven	 stage 	 s 	 	of	a	 myth 	 ic 	 	adventure	.
it	 start 	 s 	 	with	the	image	.	the	image	is	a	picture	you	have	in	your	mind	of	the	goal	at	the	end	of	the	journey	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	it	might	well	be	an	image	of	the	clock	.
then	there	's	the	point	of	embarkation	,	that	is	,	the	point	of	 transit 	 ion 	 	from	 ordin 	 ary 	 	life	to	 be 	 ing 	 	a	pilgrim	on	a	quest	.
then	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	nice	image	of	it	,	there	's	the	labyrinth	.
the	labyrinth	is	a	 con 	 cept 	 	,	it	's	like	a	 t 	 wi 	 light 	 	zone	,	it	's	a	place	where	it	's	difficult	,	where	you	get	 dis 	 oriented 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	you	get	 scar 	 ed 	 	--	but	you	have	to	go	through	it	if	you	're	going	to	get	to	some	kind	of	deep	 re 	 integ 	 ration 	 	.
then	there	should	 al 	 ways 	 	be	in	sight	the	draw	--	a	kind	of	a	beacon	that	 draw 	 s 	 	you	on	through	the	labyrinth	to	finish	the	process	of	 get 	 ting 	 	there	.
now	brian	eno	,	who	's	 be 	 en 	 	in	the	thick	of	the	long	now	process	,	 s 	 pent 	 	two	 year 	 s 	 	making	a	c.d	.	 call 	 ed 	 	``	january	7003	,	``	and	it	's	``	bell	 stud 	 ies 	 	for	the	clock	of	the	long	now	.	``
based	on	--	 part 	 s 	 	of	it	are	based	on	an	algorithm	that	danny	hillis	 develop 	 ed 	 	,	so	that	a	peal	of	10	 bell 	 s 	 	 make 	 s 	 	a	different	peal	every	day	for	10,000	 year 	 s 	 	.
the	hillis	algorithm	.	10	 factor 	 ial 	 	 give 	 s 	 	you	that	number	.
and	in	fact	,	 pre 	 tty 	 	soon	we	'll	hear	the	sound	.
january	7003	.	there	it	is	.
ok	,	back	to	danny	's	list	.
number	five	of	the	seven	is	the	 pay 	 off 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	it	.	the	climax	.
the	goal	.	the	main	thing	that	you	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	to	.
and	then	danny	 say 	 s 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	great	journey	will	have	a	secret	 pay 	 off 	 	.
 some 	 thing 	 	you	did	n't	expect	that	 cap 	 s 	 	what	you	did	expect	.
then	there	's	the	return	.
you	've	got	to	have	a	 gradu 	 al 	 	return	to	the	 ordin 	 ary 	 	world	,
so	you	have	time	to	assimilate	what	you	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	.
and	then	,	how	about	a	 me 	 ment 	 o 	 	?	number	seven	.
at	the	end	of	it	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	physical	,	a	kind	of	reward	that	you	take	away	.
it	might	be	a	piece	of	a	core	drill	of	the	mountain	.
 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	just	 your 	 s 	 	.	how	do	you	 stud 	 y 	 	a	mountain	for	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	normal	building	project	.
what	do	you	look	for	?
what	are	the	 element 	 s 	 	that	will	most	affect	your	 idea 	 s 	 	and	 decision 	 s 	 	?
start	with	 border 	 s 	 	.	if	you	look	on	the	left	side	of	the	 cliff 	 s 	 	here	,	that	's	national	park	.	that	's	 sac 	 ro 	 sanct 	 	--	you	ca	n't	do	 any 	 thing 	 	with	that	.	to	the	right	of	it	is	national	forest	.
there	's	 possibil 	 ities 	 	.	the	 border 	 s 	 	are	 import 	 ant 	 	.
other	 element 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 mine 	 s 	 	,	weather	,	 approach 	 es 	 	and	 elev 	 ation 	 	.
and	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	.	look	at	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	up	on	top	there	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	mount	washington	is	 cover 	 ed 	 	with	bristlecone	 pine 	 s 	 	.
they	're	the	world	's	 old 	 est 	 	living	thing	.
people	think	they	're	just	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	 shrub 	 s 	 	,	but	that	's	not	 actual 	 ly 	 	true	.
there	are	 tree 	 s 	 	on	that	mountain	that	are	5,000	 year 	 s 	 	old	and	still	living	.
the	wood	is	so	solid	it	's	like	stone	,	and	it	 last 	 s 	 	for	a	long	time	.
so	when	you	do	tree	ring	 stud 	 ies 	 	of	 trunk 	 s 	 	that	are	on	the	mountain	,	some	of	them	go	back	10,000	 year 	 s 	 	.
the	stone	 it 	 self 	 	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	 sculpt 	 ed 	 	by	millennia	of	 ver 	 y 	 	tough	 winter 	 s 	 	up	there	.
we	had	tree	ring	 analyst 	 s 	 	from	the	university	of	arizona	join	us	on	the	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 	.
now	,	if	you	 guy 	 s 	 	have	a	pine	 con 	 e 	 	 hand 	 y 	 	,	now	's	a	good	time	to	put	it	in	your	hand	and	feel	it	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	on	the	end	.
that	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
you	'll	find	out	why	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	a	bristlecone	pine	.	a	little	 sensor 	 y 	 	experience	.
here	's	danny	hillis	in	the	 mid 	 st 	 	of	a	bristlecone	pine	forest	on	long	now	land	.	i	should	say	that	the	age	of	bristlecones	was	 discover 	 ed 	 	,	led	by	a	 theor 	 y 	 	.
edmund	schulman	in	the	1950s	had	 be 	 en 	 	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	under	great	stress	at	timberline	,	and	came	to	the	 real 	 ization 	 	that	he	put	in	an	article	in	science	magazine	 call 	 ed 	 	,	``	 long 	 ev 	 ity 	 	under	 advers 	 ity 	 	in	conifers	.	``
and	then	,	based	on	that	principle	,	he	 start 	 ed 	 	looking	around	at	the	 vari 	 ous 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	at	timberline	,
and	 real 	 ized 	 	that	the	bristlecone	 pine 	 s 	 	--	he	found	some	in	the	white	 mountain 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	over	4,000	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
 long 	 ev 	 ity 	 	under	 advers 	 ity 	 	is	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	design	principle	in	 it 	 s 	 	own	right	.
ok	,	onto	the	 mine 	 s 	 	.	the	first	 ask 	 ing 	 	price	for	the	 proper 	 ty 	 	when	we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	it	in	1998	was	one	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	for	180	 acre 	 s 	 	and	a	couple	of	 mine 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	owner	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	there	's	one	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	of	beryllium	in	that	mountain	.	``
and	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 w 	 ow 	 	,	that	's	great	.	listen	,	we	'll	counter	.	how	about	zero	?
and	we	're	a	non	-	profit	 found 	 ation 	 	,	you	can	give	us	the	 proper 	 ty 	 	and	take	a	hell	of	a	tax	deduction	.
all	you	have	to	do	is	prove	to	the	government	it	's	worth	a	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	.	``
well	,	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	went	by	and	there	was	some	kind	of	back	and	forth	,	and	by	and	by	,	 thank 	 s 	 	to	mitch	and	jay	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	buy	the	whole	 proper 	 ty 	 	for	140,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	 mine 	 s 	 	.	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	any	beryllium	in	it	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	pole	adit	.	and	it	 do 	 es 	 	have	 t 	 ung 	 sten 	 	,	a	little	bit	of	 t 	 ung 	 sten 	 	,	left	over	,	that	's	the	kind	of	mine	it	was	.
but	it	 go 	 es 	 	a	mile	-	and	-	a	-	half	in	a	straight	line	,	due	east	 in 	 to 	 	the	range	,	 in 	 to 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 territ 	 ory 	 	--	 ex 	 cept 	 	that	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	'll	see	when	we	go	 in 	 side 	 	in	a	minute	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 hop 	 ing 	 	for	 lime 	 stone 	 	but	in	there	is	just	 sha 	 le 	 	.
and	 sha 	 le 	 	is	not	 quit 	 e 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	 compete 	 nt 	 	rock	.
 compete 	 nt 	 	rock	is	rock	that	will	hold	 it 	 self 	 	up	 with 	 out 	 	any	shoring	.
the	 sha 	 le 	 	would	like	some	shoring	,	and	so	 part 	 s 	 	of	it	are	 cav 	 ed 	 	in	in	there	.
that	's	ben	roberts	from	--	he	's	the	bat	 special 	 ist 	 	from	the	national	park	.
but	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 wonder 	 s 	 	back	in	there	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	weird	fungus	on	some	of	the	 collapse 	 d 	 	 timber 	 s 	 	.
ok	,	here	's	 an 	 other 	 	mine	that	's	up	on	top	of	the	 proper 	 ty 	 	,	and	it	 date 	 s 	 	back	to	1870	.
that	's	what	the	 proper 	 ty 	 	was	 original 	 ly 	 	built	around	--	it	was	a	set	of	 min 	 ing 	 	 claim 	 s 	 	.	it	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	productive	silver	mine	.
in	fact	,	it	was	the	highest	-	 oper 	 ating 	 	mine	in	nevada	,	and	it	ran	year	round	.
you	can	imagine	what	it	was	like	in	the	winter	at	10,000	feet	.
you	may	 recogn 	 ize 	 	a	couple	of	the	 min 	 ers 	 	there	.
there	's	jeff	bezos	on	the	right	and	paul	saville	on	the	left	looking	for	galena	,	which	is	the	lead	-	silver	thing	.	they	did	n't	find	any	.
they	both	 ke 	 pt 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	day	 job 	 s 	 	.	here	's	the	last	mine	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 bon 	 a 	 nza 	 	adit	.	it	's	down	in	a	canyon	.
and	alexander	rose	on	the	left	there	 work 	 ed 	 	with	a	bunch	of	people	from	the	national	park	to	survey	the	whole	mine	.	it	's	a	mile	deep	.
and	they	 al 	 so 	 	found	four	species	of	 bat 	 s 	 	in	there	.
now	,	 al 	 most 	 	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 mine 	 s 	 	,	by	the	way	,	meet	 under 	 neath 	 	the	mountain	.
they	do	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	,	but	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	to	think	about	.
they	do	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	meet	.
let	's	go	to	weather	.	 mountain 	 s 	 	 special 	 ize 	 	in	 interest 	 ing 	 	weather	.
way	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	than	monterey	even	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	so	one	tuesday	 morn 	 ing 	 	last	june	,	there	we	 we 	 re 	 	.
 wok 	 e 	 	up	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	--	the	mountain	was	 cover 	 ed 	 	with	snow	.
that	was	a	great	time	to	go	up	and	visit	our	weather	station	which	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 thank 	 s 	 	to	mitch	kapor	,	we	're	building	up	there	.
and	it	's	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	scene	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	,	on	the	left	there	,	the	 joy 	 ful 	 	 lad 	 y 	 	is	pat	irwin	,	who	's	the	 region 	 al 	 	head	of	the	national	forest	service	,	and	they	 g 	 ave 	 	us	the	 tempor 	 ary 	 	use	permit	to	be	there	.
we	want	a	 tempor 	 ary 	 	use	permit	for	the	clock	,	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	--	10,000	-	year	 tempor 	 ary 	 	use	permit	.
the	weather	station	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
kurt	bollacker	and	alexander	rose	designed	a	 radical 	 ly 	 	 wire 	 less 	 	station	.
it	 run 	 s 	 	on	solar	,	and	it	 s 	 end 	 s 	 	a	signal	with	that	antenna	and	 bounc 	 es 	 	it	off	of	micrometeorite	 trail 	 s 	 	in	the	atmosphere	to	a	place	in	bozeman	,	montana	,	where	the	data	is	taken	down	and	then	 s 	 ent 	 	through	 land 	 lines 	 	to	san	francisco	,	where	we	put	the	data	in	real	time	up	on	our	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
and	there	you	see	a	week	of	weather	at	9,400	feet	on	mount	washington	.
let	's	go	to	 approach 	 es 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	it	 happen 	 s 	 	,	there	are	no	 trail 	 s 	 	 any 	 where 	 	on	mount	washington	,	just	a	few	old	 min 	 ing 	 	 road 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	so	you	have	to	bushwhack	 every 	 where 	 	.
but	there	's	no	 bear 	 s 	 	,	and	there	's	no	poison	oak	,	and	there	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	no	people	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	place	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	empty	for	a	long	time	.
you	can	 hik 	 e 	 	for	 day 	 s 	 	and	not	 en 	 counter 	 	 any 	 body 	 	.
well	,	here	's	a	potential	approach	.
you	need	to	come	up	the	lincoln	canyon	.
it	's	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	world	all	of	 it 	 s 	 	own	,	 surround 	 ed 	 	by	 cliff 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	an	easy	 hik 	 e 	 	to	 s 	 troll 	 	up	the	canyon	bottom	,	 un 	 til 	 	you	get	to	 th 	 is 	 	 bar 	 rier 	 	,	and	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 present 	 s 	 	a	problem	.
so	you	can	scratch	lincoln	canyon	 a 	 s 	 	an	approach	.
 an 	 other 	 	possible	approach	is	right	up	the	western	front	of	the	mountain	.
you	can	see	why	we	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	call	it	long	mountain	.
and	from	where	you	're	 stand 	 ing 	 	at	6,000	feet	in	the	 val 	 ley 	 	,	it	's	an	easy	 hik 	 e 	 	up	to	the	mature	pinyon	and	 juni 	 per 	 	forest	through	that	knoll	at	the	front	at	7,600	feet	.
and	you	can	carry	right	on	up	through	 meadow 	 s 	 	and	steepening	forest	to	the	high	base	of	the	 cliff 	 s 	 	at	10,500	feet	,
where	there	's	a	bit	of	a	problem	.
now	,	jeff	bezos	 advise 	 d 	 	us	when	he	left	at	the	end	of	the	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 	,	``	make	the	clock	 in 	 access 	 ible 	 	.
the	 hard 	 er 	 	it	is	to	get	to	,	the	more	people	will	value	it	.	``
and	check	--	 t 	 hose 	 	are	600	-	foot	 vert 	 ical 	 	 wall 	 s 	 	there	.
so	alexander	rose	 want 	 ed 	 	to	explore	 th 	 is 	 	route	,	and	he	 start 	 ed 	 	over	here	on	the	left	from	his	 pick 	 up 	 	truck	at	8,900	feet	and	headed	up	the	mountain	.
now	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	gain	 elev 	 ation 	 	your	iq	 go 	 es 	 	down	--	but	your	 emotion 	 al 	 	affect	 go 	 es 	 	up	,	which	is	great	for	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	 myth 	 ic 	 	experience	,	 whet 	 her 	 	you	want	to	or	not	.
in	fact	,	danny	hillis	can	estimate	altitude	by	how	much	math	he	ca	n't	do	in	his	head	.
now	,	i	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	be	on	the	radio	with	alexander	when	he	got	to	 th 	 is 	 	point	at	the	base	of	the	 cliff 	 s 	 	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	quote	,	``	there	's	a	 hid 	 den 	 	 not 	 ch 	 	.	i	think	i	can	get	up	a	ways	.	``
now	,	he	's	a	rock	 climb 	 er 	 	,	but	you	know	,	he	's	our	 ex 	 ecutive 	 	director	.
i	do	n't	want	him	 kill 	 ed 	 	.	i	know	he	's	going	to	love	 cliff 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	be	 care 	 ful 	 	,	be	 care 	 ful 	 	,	be	 care 	 ful 	 	.	``
then	he	 start 	 s 	 	going	up	,	and	the	next	thing	i	hear	is	,	``	i	'm	half	-	way	up	.	it	's	like	 climb 	 ing 	 	 stair 	 s 	 	.	i	'm	going	up	60	 degree 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	secret	 pass 	 age 	 	.	it	's	like	 some 	 thing 	 	from	tolkien	.	``
and	i	'm	going	,	``	 care 	 ful 	 	,	 care 	 ful 	 	.	 pleas 	 e 	 	be	 care 	 ful 	 	.	``
and	then	,	of	course	,	the	next	thing	i	hear	is	,	``	i	've	made	it	to	the	top	.	you	can	see	all	of	creation	from	up	here	.	``
and	he	 dash 	 ed 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	top	of	the	 mountain 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	there	he	is	.	that	's	alexander	rose	.
first	 a 	 s 	 cent 	 	of	the	western	face	to	mount	washington	,	and	a	 s 	 olo 	 	 a 	 s 	 cent 	 	at	that	.
 th 	 is 	 	 discover 	 y 	 	 change 	 d 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	about	our	sense	of	these	 cliff 	 s 	 	and	what	to	do	with	them	.
we	 real 	 ized 	 	that	we	had	to	name	 th 	 is 	 	thing	that	alexander	 discover 	 ed 	 	.
how	about	zander	's	 cre 	 vice 	 	?	no	.
so	we	 final 	 ly 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	on	alexander	's	siq	.
zander	's	siq	is	named	after	--	some	of	you	have	 be 	 en 	 	to	petra	,	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 s 	 lot 	 	canyon	that	 lead 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	petra	 call 	 ed 	 	the	siq	,	and	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	siq	.
and	it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	 hid 	 den 	 	.	i	ca	n't	find	it	in	 th 	 is 	 	image	,	and	i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	you	can	.
 on 	 ly 	 	when	you	get	fresh	snow	can	you	see	just	 a 	 long 	 	the	rim	there	,	and	that	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	it	out	.
now	,	danny	and	i	 we 	 re 	 	up	at	 th 	 is 	 	same	area	one	day	,	and	danny	 look 	 ed 	 	over	to	the	right	and	 notice 	 d 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 half 	 way 	 	up	the	 cliff 	 s 	 	,	which	is	a	kind	of	a	porch	or	a	cliff	shelf	with	bristlecones	on	it	,	and	 suppose 	 d 	 	that	people	going	up	to	the	clock	 in 	 side 	 	the	mountain	could	come	out	onto	that	shelf	and	look	down	at	the	view	.
and	the	people	 toil 	 ing 	 	up	the	mountain	could	see	them	,	these	 tin 	 y 	 	little	people	up	there	,	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 half 	 way 	 	up	the	cliff	.
how	did	they	get	there	?	do	i	have	to	do	that	?
and	so	that	 may 	 be 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	part	of	the	draw	and	part	of	the	labyrinth	.
you	can	get	 an 	 other 	 	angle	on	danny	's	porch	by	going	around	to	the	south	and	looking	north	at	the	whole	 form 	 ation 	 	there	.
and	you	need	to	know	that	danny	's	clock	is	to	be	 ke 	 pt 	 	accurate	by	a	ray	of	 s 	 un 	 shine 	 	,	that	perfect	noon	hitting	it	every	 s 	 un 	 ny 	 	day	,	and	the	 puls 	 e 	 	of	heat	from	that	 set 	 s 	 	off	a	solar	trigger	which	resets	the	clock	to	make	it	 perfect 	 ly 	 	accurate	.
so	even	with	the	 s 	 low 	 ing 	 	of	the	 rot 	 ation 	 	of	the	earth	and	so	on	,	the	clock	will	keep	 perfect 	 ly 	 	good	time	.
so	here	we	're	looking	from	the	south	,	look	north	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	all	forest	service	land	.	if	you	go	up	on	top	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 cliff 	 s 	 	,	that	's	some	of	the	long	now	land	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	.
and	if	you	go	up	there	and	look	back	,	then	you	'll	get	a	sense	of	what	the	view	 start 	 s 	 	to	be	like	from	the	top	of	the	mountain	.
that	's	the	long	view	.	that	's	80	 mile 	 s 	 	to	the	horizon	.
and	that	's	 al 	 so 	 	timberline	and	 t 	 hose 	 	bristlecones	 re 	 ally 	 	are	 shrub 	 s 	 	.
that	's	a	different	place	to	be	.	it	's	11,400	feet	and	it	's	exquisite	.
now	,	if	you	go	over	to	the	right	from	 th 	 is 	 	image	to	looking	at	the	edge	of	the	 cliff 	 s 	 	,	it	's	600	foot	,	just	about	a	yard	to	the	left	of	kurt	bollacker	's	foot	,	there	is	a	600	-	foot	drop	.	he	's	 am 	 bling 	 	on	over	to	zander	's	siq	.
that	's	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	looking	down	it	.
we	should	 prob 	 ably 	 	put	in	a	rail	or	 some 	 thing 	 	.
over	on	the	eastern	side	it	's	gentle	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	.
and	that	's	not	snow	--	that	's	what	the	white	 lime 	 stone 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
you	 al 	 so 	 	see	there	a	bighorn	sheep	.
 the 	 ir 	 	herd	was	 re 	 introduc 	 ed 	 	from	wyoming	.
and	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	well	,	but	they	've	got	a	bit	of	trouble	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	danny	hillis	,	and	he	's	 figur 	 ing 	 	out	a	design	problem	.
he	's	 try 	 ing 	 	to	determine	if	where	he	is	on	a	bit	of	long	now	land	would	appear	from	down	in	the	 val 	 ley 	 	to	be	the	actual	peak	of	the	mountain	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	real	peak	is	 hid 	 den 	 	around	the	corner	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	in	the	 infant 	 ry 	 	we	used	to	call	the	 militar 	 y 	 	crest	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	the	answer	is	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	that	is	from	down	 be 	 low 	 	in	the	 val 	 ley 	 	it	 do 	 es 	 	look	like	the	peak	,	and	that	might	be	 conjure 	 d 	 	with	.
we	 gradu 	 ally 	 	 real 	 ized 	 	we	have	three	serious	design	 domain 	 s 	 	to	work	on	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
one	is	the	experience	of	the	mountain	.
 an 	 other 	 	is	the	experience	in	the	mountain	.
and	the	third	is	the	experience	from	the	mountain	,	which	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 dominate 	 d 	 	by	the	view	shed	of	the	spring	 val 	 ley 	 	there	 be 	 hind 	 	danny	,	and	if	you	look	off	to	the	right	,	out	there	,	15	 mile 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	to	the	schell	creek	range	.
in	the	front	,	there	are	10	ranches	 st 	 rung 	 	right	 a 	 long 	 	the	base	of	the	 mountain 	 s 	 	using	the	water	from	the	 mountain 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	there	are	artesian	 well 	 s 	 	where	water	 spring 	 s 	 	right	 in 	 to 	 	the	air	.
one	of	the	ranches	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	kirkeby	ranch	,	and	i	'll	take	you	there	for	a	minute	.
it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	nice	ranch	.
alfalfa	and	cattle	,	run	by	paul	and	ronnie	brenham	,	and	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	 idy 	 llic 	 	.	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	hard	work	.
and	most	of	these	ranches	are	 hav 	 ing 	 	trouble	 keep 	 ing 	 	going	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 the 	 ir 	 	view	to	the	west	of	the	schell	creek	range	.
and	if	you	go	out	to	that	line	of	 tree 	 s 	 	at	the	far	end	,	you	'll	see	what	the	 val 	 ley 	 	used	to	look	like	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 rock 	 y 	 	mountain	junipers	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	there	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	a	scheme	 emerge 	 d 	 	that	long	now	is	looking	to	see	if	it	might	be	possible	to	buy	up	the	whole	 val 	 ley 	 	,
 be 	 cause 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	10	ranches	with	 the 	 ir 	 	17,000	 acre 	 s 	 	dominate	a	500	square	mile	 val 	 ley 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	grazing	allotments	and	so	on	,	and	there	's	a	 possibil 	 ity 	 	that	you	could	get	the	whole	thing	for	five	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	and	 gradu 	 ally 	 	 re 	 store 	 	it	to	 it 	 s 	 	wild	condition	,	and	 some 	 where 	 	in	the	process	turn	it	back	over	to	the	national	park	,	and	it	would	double	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	great	basin	national	park	.	that	would	be	 s 	 well 	 	.
ok	,	let	's	take	one	more	look	at	the	mountain	 it 	 self 	 	.
the	clock	experience	should	be	 pro 	 found 	 	,	but	from	the	 out 	 side 	 	it	should	be	 in 	 visible 	 	.
now	,	at	the	base	of	the	high	 cliff 	 s 	 	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	natural	cave	.
it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	about	12	feet	deep	,	but	what	if	it	 we 	 re 	 	 deepen 	 ed 	 	from	 in 	 side 	 	?
you	 excav 	 ated 	 	from	 some 	 where 	 	,	came	up	from	 in 	 side 	 	and	 deepen 	 ed 	 	it	.
and	then	you	could	have	an	 en 	 trance 	 	which	was	 ver 	 y 	 	rough	and	narrow	 a 	 s 	 	you	first	went	in	,	that	 gradu 	 ally 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	more	 refine 	 d 	 	and	then	 actual 	 ly 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	exquisite	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	stone	 take 	 s 	 	a	perfect	polish	.
you	'd	have	a	 polish 	 ed 	 	set	of	 pass 	 age 	 s 	 	and	 chamber 	 s 	 	in	there	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 lead 	 ing 	 	to	the	10,000	year	clock	.
and	it	's	not	a	mine	.	 th 	 is 	 	would	be	a	 nuance 	 d 	 	evocation	of	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	structure	of	the	mountain	,	and	you	would	be	 appreci 	 ating 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	much	from	 in 	 side 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	do	from	 out 	 side 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 architect 	 ure 	 	not	made	by	building	,	but	by	what	you	 ver 	 y 	 	 care 	 fully 	 	take	away	.
so	that	's	what	the	mountain	taught	us	.
most	of	the	amazingness	of	the	clock	we	can	borrow	from	the	amazingness	of	the	mountain	.
all	we	have	to	do	is	 high 	 light 	 	 it 	 s 	 	spectacular	 feature 	 s 	 	and	blend	in	with	them	.
it	's	not	a	clock	in	a	mountain	--	it	's	a	mountain	clock	.
now	,	the	tewa	 in 	 d 	 ians 	 	in	the	 south 	 west 	 	have	a	 say 	 ing 	 	for	what	you	need	to	do	when	you	want	to	think	long	term	about	 any 	 thing 	 	.
they	say	,	``	pin	peya	obe	``	--	welcome	to	the	mountain	.
thank	you	.
