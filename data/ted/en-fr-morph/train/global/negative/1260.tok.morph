what	is	it	about	 fly 	 ing 	 	 car 	 s 	 	?
we	've	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	for	about	a	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	there	are	historic	 attempt 	 s 	 	that	have	had	some	level	of	technical	success	.
but	we	have	n't	yet	gotten	to	the	point	where	on	your	way	here	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	you	see	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 tru 	 ly 	 	 seam 	 lessly 	 	 integrate 	 s 	 	the	two	-	dimensional	world	that	we	're	 comfort 	 able 	 	in	with	the	three	-	dimensional	sky	above	us	--	that	,	i	do	n't	know	about	you	,	but	i	 re 	 ally 	 	enjoy	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	time	in	.
we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	 historic 	 al 	 	 attempt 	 s 	 	that	had	 be 	 en 	 	out	there	and	 real 	 ized 	 	that	,	 de 	 spite 	 	the	fact	that	we	have	a	lot	of	modern	 innov 	 ations 	 	to	draw	on	 to 	 day 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 avail 	 able 	 	 previous 	 ly 	 	--	we	have	modern	composite	 material 	 s 	 	,	we	have	 air 	 craft 	 	 engine 	 s 	 	that	get	good	fuel	 eco 	 nomy 	 	and	have	better	power	-	to	-	rate	 ratio 	 s 	 	than	have	ever	 be 	 en 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	,	we	have	glass	 cock 	 pit 	 	avionics	that	 br 	 ing 	 	the	information	you	need	to	fly	 direct 	 ly 	 	to	you	in	the	 cock 	 pit 	 	--	but	 with 	 out 	 	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	 address 	 ing 	 	the	problem	from	a	different	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	we	 real 	 ized 	 	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	be	 get 	 ting 	 	the	same	result	that	people	had	 be 	 en 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	for	the	last	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	,	which	is	n't	where	we	want	to	be	right	now	.
so	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	a	car	that	can	fly	,	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	try	to	make	a	plane	that	could	drive	.
and	the	result	is	the	terrafugia	 transit 	 ion 	 	.
it	's	a	two	-	seat	,	single	-	engine	 air 	 plane 	 	that	 work 	 s 	 	just	like	any	other	small	 air 	 plane 	 	.
you	take	off	and	land	at	a	local	 air 	 port 	 	.
then	once	you	're	on	the	ground	,	you	fold	up	the	 wing 	 s 	 	,	drive	it	home	,	park	it	in	your	 gar 	 age 	 	.
and	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
after	two	 year 	 s 	 	of	an	 innov 	 ative 	 	design	and	construction	process	,	the	proof	of	 con 	 cept 	 	made	 it 	 s 	 	public	debut	in	2008	.
now	like	with	 any 	 thing 	 	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	different	from	the	 stat 	 us 	 	quo	,	it	did	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	go	so	well	 test 	 ing 	 	that	 air 	 craft 	 	.
and	we	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	thing	that	,	when	you	go	home	with	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	broken	,	you	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	a	lot	more	than	when	you	 manage 	 d 	 	to	tick	off	all	of	your	test	 object 	 ive 	 s 	 	the	first	time	through	.
still	,	we	 ver 	 y 	 	much	 want 	 ed 	 	to	see	the	 air 	 craft 	 	that	we	'd	all	 help 	 ed 	 	build	in	the	air	,	off	the	ground	,	like	it	was	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	.
and	on	our	third	high	-	speed	 test 	 ing 	 	 deploy 	 ment 	 	on	a	bitter	cold	 morn 	 ing 	 	in	 up 	 state 	 	new	york	,	we	got	to	do	that	for	the	first	time	.
the	picture	 be 	 hind 	 	me	was	 snap 	 ped 	 	by	the	 co 	 pilot 	 	in	our	chase	 air 	 craft 	 	just	 moment 	 s 	 	after	the	 wheel 	 s 	 	got	off	the	ground	for	the	first	time	.
and	we	 we 	 re 	 	all	 ver 	 y 	 	 flatter 	 ed 	 	to	see	that	image	 be 	 come 	 	a	symbol	of	 accomplish 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	people	had	thought	was	 im 	 possible 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	the	world	over	.
the	flight	 test 	 ing 	 	that	 follow 	 ed 	 	that	was	 a 	 s 	 	 bas 	 ic 	 	and	low	-	risk	 a 	 s 	 	we	could	make	it	,	but	it	still	 accomplish 	 ed 	 	what	we	 need 	 ed 	 	to	to	take	the	program	to	the	next	step	and	to	gain	the	 cr 	 ed 	 ibility 	 	that	we	 need 	 ed 	 	 with 	 in 	 	our	 event 	 ual 	 	market	,	the	general	 av 	 iation 	 	community	,	and	with	the	 regulat 	 ors 	 	that	govern	the	use	of	design	of	 air 	 craft 	 	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	in	the	 state 	 s 	 	.
the	faa	,	about	a	year	ago	,	 g 	 ave 	 	us	an	 exempt 	 ion 	 	for	the	 transit 	 ion 	 	to	allow	us	to	have	an	 add 	 ition 	 al 	 	110	 lb 	 s 	 	.	 with 	 in 	 	the	light	 s 	 port 	 	 air 	 craft 	 	 categor 	 y 	 	.
now	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	sound	like	a	lot	,	but	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	deliver	the	 transit 	 ion 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	light	 s 	 port 	 	 air 	 craft 	 	 make 	 s 	 	it	 simpl 	 er 	 	for	us	to	 cert 	 ify 	 	it	,	but	it	 al 	 so 	 	 make 	 s 	 	it	much	 eas 	 ier 	 	for	you	to	learn	how	to	fly	it	.
a	 s 	 port 	 	pilot	can	be	 certificate 	 d 	 	in	 a 	 s 	 	little	 a 	 s 	 	20	 hour 	 s 	 	of	flight	time	.
and	at	110	 lb 	 s 	 	.	,	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	for	solving	the	other	side	of	the	 equ 	 ation 	 	--	 driv 	 ing 	 	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	 driv 	 ing 	 	,	with	 it 	 s 	 	 associate 	 d 	 	design	 implement 	 ation 	 	and	 regulat 	 ory 	 	 hurdle 	 s 	 	,	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 hard 	 er 	 	problem	to	solve	than	 fly 	 ing 	 	.
for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	us	that	 s 	 pend 	 	most	of	our	 live 	 s 	 	on	the	ground	,	 th 	 is 	 	may	be	counter	-	intuitive	,	but	 driv 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 pot 	 hole 	 s 	 	,	 cobble 	 stone 	 s 	 	,	 pedestrian 	 s 	 	,	other	 driver 	 s 	 	and	a	 ra 	 ther 	 	long	and	 detail 	 ed 	 	list	of	federal	motor	vehicle	 safe 	 ty 	 	 standard 	 s 	 	to	 con 	 tend 	 	with	.

we	have	a	carbon	fiber	 safe 	 ty 	 	cage	that	 protect 	 s 	 	the	 occu 	 pants 	 	for	less	than	10	percent	of	the	weight	of	a	 tradition 	 al 	 	steel	 cha 	 s 	 sis 	 	in	a	car	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	 al 	 so 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	good	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	,	was	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	.
the	 regulat 	 ions 	 	for	 vehicle 	 s 	 	on	the	road	 we 	 re 	 	n't	written	with	an	 air 	 plane 	 	in	mind	.
so	we	did	need	a	little	bit	of	support	from	the	national	 high 	 way 	 	traffic	 safe 	 ty 	 	 administr 	 ation 	 	.
now	you	may	have	 s 	 een 	 	in	the	news	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	they	came	through	with	us	at	the	end	of	last	month	with	a	few	special	 exempt 	 ions 	 	that	will	allow	the	 transit 	 ion 	 	to	be	 s 	 old 	 	in	the	same	 categor 	 y 	 	 a 	 s 	 	suvs	and	light	 truck 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	multi	-	purpose	passenger	vehicle	,	it	is	now	 official 	 ly 	 	``	designed	for	 occasion 	 al 	 	off	-	road	use	.	``
now	let	's	see	it	in	action	.
you	can	see	there	the	 wing 	 s 	 	 fold 	 ed 	 	up	just	 a 	 long 	 	the	side	of	the	plane	.
you	're	not	 power 	 ing 	 	the	 propel 	 ler 	 	,	you	're	 power 	 ing 	 	the	 wheel 	 s 	 	.
and	it	is	under	seven	feet	tall	,	so	it	will	fit	in	a	standard	construction	 gar 	 age 	 	.
and	that	's	the	 autom 	 ated 	 	wing	-	 fold 	 ing 	 	 mechan 	 ism 	 	.
that	's	real	time	.
you	just	push	a	few	 button 	 s 	 	in	the	 cock 	 pit 	 	,	and	the	 wing 	 s 	 	come	out	.
once	they	're	fully	 deploy 	 ed 	 	,	there	's	a	 mechanic 	 al 	 	lock	that	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	place	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	from	 in 	 side 	 	the	 cock 	 pit 	 	.
and	they	're	now	fully	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 hand 	 ling 	 	any	of	the	 load 	 s 	 	you	would	see	in	flight	--	just	like	 put 	 ting 	 	down	your	 convert 	 ible 	 	top	.
and	you	're	all	 think 	 ing 	 	what	your	 neighbor 	 s 	 	would	think	of	 see 	 ing 	 	that	.
test	pilot	:	 un 	 til 	 	the	vehicle	flies	,	75	percent	of	your	risk	is	that	first	flight	.
radio	:	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	flew	.	 y 	 es 	 	.
radio	2	:	that	was	 gorge 	 ous 	 	.
radio	:	what	did	you	think	of	that	?
that	was	 beaut 	 iful 	 	from	up	here	,	i	tell	you	.
amd	:	see	,	we	're	all	 exceed 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	that	little	 bun 	 ny 	 	hop	.
and	our	test	pilot	 g 	 ave 	 	us	the	best	 feed 	 back 	 	you	can	get	from	a	test	pilot	after	a	first	flight	,	which	was	that	it	was	``	 remark 	 ably 	 	 un 	 remark 	 able 	 	.	``
he	would	go	onto	tell	us	that	the	 transit 	 ion 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	the	 eas 	 iest 	 	 air 	 plane 	 	to	land	that	he	'd	 flow 	 n 	 	in	his	entire	30	-	year	 care 	 er 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	test	pilot	.
so	 de 	 spite 	 	making	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	 seem 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 revolution 	 ary 	 	,	we	 re 	 ally 	 	focused	on	 do 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	little	new	 a 	 s 	 	possible	.
we	leverage	a	lot	of	technology	from	the	state	-	of	-	the	-	art	in	general	 av 	 iation 	 	and	from	 auto 	 motive 	 	 rac 	 ing 	 	.
when	we	do	have	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	 tru 	 ly 	 	out	-	of	-	the	-	box	,	we	use	an	 increment 	 al 	 	design	,	build	,	test	,	 re 	 design 	 	cycle	that	lets	us	 reduc 	 e 	 	risk	in	baby	 step 	 s 	 	.
now	since	we	 start 	 ed 	 	terrafugia	about	6	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	we	've	had	a	lot	of	 t 	 hose 	 	baby	 step 	 s 	 	.
we	've	gone	from	 be 	 ing 	 	three	of	us	 work 	 ing 	 	in	the	 base 	 ment 	 	at	mit	while	we	 we 	 re 	 	still	in	graduate	school	to	about	two	-	dozen	of	us	 work 	 ing 	 	in	an	 initi 	 al 	 	production	 facil 	 ity 	 	 out 	 side 	 	of	boston	.
we	've	had	to	 over 	 come 	 	 challeng 	 es 	 	like	 keep 	 ing 	 	the	weight	 be 	 low 	 	the	light	 s 	 port 	 	limit	that	i	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	,	 figur 	 ing 	 	out	how	to	 polite 	 ly 	 	respond	when	a	 regulat 	 or 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	you	,	``	but	that	wo	n't	fit	through	a	toll	booth	with	the	 wing 	 s 	 	 extend 	 ed 	 	--	to	all	of	the	other	 associate 	 d 	 	 dur 	 ability 	 	and	 engineer 	 ing 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	that	we	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	on	the	ground	.
still	,	if	 every 	 thing 	 	 go 	 es 	 	to	our	satisfaction	with	the	 test 	 ing 	 	and	construction	of	the	two	production	 prototype 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	on	right	now	,	 t 	 hose 	 	first	 deliver 	 ies 	 	to	the	,	about	a	hundred	,	people	who	have	 re 	 serv 	 ed 	 	an	 air 	 plane 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	should	begin	at	the	end	of	next	year	.
the	 transit 	 ion 	 	will	cost	in	line	with	other	small	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'm	 certain 	 ly 	 	not	out	to	replace	your	chevy	,	but	i	do	think	that	the	 transit 	 ion 	 	should	be	your	next	 air 	 plane 	 	.
here	's	why	.
while	 near 	 ly 	 	all	of	the	commercial	air	travel	in	the	world	 go 	 es 	 	through	a	 relat 	 ively 	 	small	number	of	large	hub	 air 	 port 	 s 	 	,	there	is	a	huge	 under 	 util 	 ized 	 	resource	out	there	.
there	are	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	local	 air 	 strip 	 s 	 	that	do	n't	see	 near 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 air 	 craft 	 	 operation 	 s 	 	a	day	 a 	 s 	 	they	could	.
on	average	,	there	's	one	 with 	 in 	 	20	to	30	 mile 	 s 	 	of	 where 	 ver 	 	you	are	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
the	 transit 	 ion 	 	 give 	 s 	 	you	a	 safe 	 r 	 	,	more	convenient	and	more	 f 	 un 	 	way	of	using	 th 	 is 	 	resource	.
for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	are	n't	yet	 pilot 	 s 	 	,	there	's	four	main	 reason 	 s 	 	why	 t 	 hose 	 	of	us	who	are	do	n't	fly	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	we	'd	like	to	:	the	weather	,	 prim 	 arily 	 	,	cost	,	long	door	-	to	-	door	travel	time	and	 mobil 	 ity 	 	at	your	destination	.
now	,	bad	weather	 come 	 s 	 	in	,	just	land	,	fold	up	the	 wing 	 s 	 	,	drive	home	.
 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	if	it	 rain 	 s 	 	a	little	,	you	have	a	 wind 	 shield 	 	 wipe 	 r 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	 pay 	 ing 	 	to	keep	your	 air 	 plane 	 	in	a	 hang 	 er 	 	,	park	it	in	your	 gar 	 age 	 	.
and	the	 un 	 lead 	 ed 	 	 auto 	 motive 	 	fuel	that	we	use	is	both	 cheap 	 er 	 	and	better	for	the	environment	than	 tradition 	 al 	 	 av 	 gas 	 	.
door	-	to	-	door	travel	time	is	 reduc 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	now	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 lugg 	 ing 	 	 bag 	 s 	 	,	 find 	 ing 	 	a	 park 	 ing 	 	space	,	taking	off	your	 shoe 	 s 	 	or	 pull 	 ing 	 	your	 air 	 plane 	 	out	of	the	 hang 	 er 	 	,	you	're	now	just	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	that	time	 get 	 ting 	 	to	where	you	want	to	go	.
and	 mobil 	 ity 	 	to	your	destination	is	 clear 	 ly 	 	 solve 	 d 	 	.
just	fold	up	the	 wing 	 s 	 	and	keep	going	.
the	 transit 	 ion 	 	 simultaneous 	 ly 	 	 expand 	 s 	 	our	 horizon 	 s 	 	while	making	the	world	a	 small 	 er 	 	,	more	 access 	 ible 	 	place	.
it	 al 	 so 	 	 continu 	 es 	 	to	be	a	fabulous	adventure	.
i	hope	you	'll	each	take	a	moment	to	think	about	how	you	could	use	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 
to	give	 your 	 self 	 	more	access	to	your	own	world	,	and	to	make	your	own	travel	more	convenient	and	more	 f 	 un 	 	.
thank	you	for	giving	me	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	share	it	with	you	.
