thank	you	.	i	have	to	tell	you	i	'm	both	 challeng 	 ed 	 	and	 excit 	 ed 	 	.
my	 excit 	 ement 	 	is	:	i	get	a	chance	to	give	 some 	 thing 	 	back	.
my	 challeng 	 e 	 	is	:	the	 short 	 est 	 	 semi 	 nar 	 	i	 usual 	 ly 	 	do	is	50	 hour 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	not	 exagge 	 rating 	 	.	i	do	 week 	 end 	 s 	 	,	and	what	i	do	--	i	do	even	more	than	that	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	coach	people	--	but	i	'm	 in 	 to 	 	 immers 	 ion 	 	.	 be 	 cause 	 	how	did	you	learn	language	?
you	did	n't	learn	it	by	just	 learn 	 ing 	 	 principle 	 s 	 	,	you	got	in	it	and	you	did	it	so	often	that	it	 be 	 came 	 	real	.
and	the	bottom	line	of	why	i	'm	here	,	 be 	 side 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	a	crazy	 mo 	 fo 	 	,	is	that	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	in	a	position	--	i	'm	not	here	to	 motiv 	 ate 	 	you	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	;	you	do	n't	need	that	.
and	a	lot	of	 time 	 s 	 	that	's	what	people	think	i	do	,	and	it	's	the	 fur 	 th 	 est 	 	thing	from	it	.	what	 happen 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	is	people	say	to	me	,	``	i	do	n't	need	any	 motiv 	 ation 	 	.	``
and	i	say	,	``	well	,	that	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	.	that	's	not	what	i	do	.	``
i	'm	the	``	why	``	guy	.	i	want	to	know	why	you	do	what	you	do	.
what	is	your	motive	for	action	?
what	is	it	that	 drive 	 s 	 	you	in	your	life	 to 	 day 	 	?	not	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
or	are	you	running	the	same	pattern	?	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	the	 in 	 visible 	 	force	of	internal	drive	,	 activate 	 d 	 	,	is	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	in	the	world	.
i	'm	here	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 believ 	 e 	 	emotion	is	the	force	of	life	.
all	of	us	here	have	great	 mind 	 s 	 	.
you	know	?	most	of	us	here	have	great	 mind 	 s 	 	,	right	?
i	do	n't	know	about	 an 	 other 	 	 categor 	 y 	 	,	but	we	all	know	how	to	think	.
and	with	our	 mind 	 s 	 	we	can	 rational 	 ize 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	.
we	can	make	 any 	 thing 	 	happen	.	we	can	--	i	agree	with	what	was	 de 	 scribed 	 	a	few	 day 	 s 	 	ago	,	about	 th 	 is 	 	idea	that	people	work	in	 the 	 ir 	 	self	-	interest	.
but	we	all	know	that	that	's	 bull 	 shit 	 	at	 time 	 s 	 	.
you	do	n't	work	in	your	self	-	interest	all	the	time	,	 be 	 cause 	 	when	emotion	 come 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	it	,	the	wiring	 change 	 s 	 	in	the	way	it	 function 	 s 	 	.
and	so	it	's	 wonder 	 ful 	 	for	us	to	think	 intellectual 	 ly 	 	about	how	the	life	of	the	world	is	,	and	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	who	are	 ver 	 y 	 	smart	--	we	can	play	 th 	 is 	 	game	in	our	head	.
but	i	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	know	what	's	 driv 	 ing 	 	you	.
and	what	i	would	like	to	 may 	 be 	 	 invit 	 e 	 	you	to	do	by	the	end	of	 th 	 is 	 	talk	is	explore	where	you	are	 to 	 day 	 	,	for	two	 reason 	 s 	 	.	one	:	so	that	you	can	 con 	 tribute 	 	more	.	and	two	:	so	that	 hope 	 fully 	 	we	can	not	just	understand	other	people	more	,	but	 may 	 be 	 	appreciate	them	more	,	and	create	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 connect 	 ions 	 	that	can	stop	some	of	the	 challeng 	 es 	 	that	we	face	in	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
they	're	 on 	 ly 	 	going	to	get	 magn 	 ified 	 	by	the	 ver 	 y 	 	technology	that	's	 connect 	 ing 	 	us	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	making	us	intersect	.	and	that	 intersect 	 ion 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	create	the	view	of	``	 every 	 body 	 	now	 understand 	 s 	 	 every 	 body 	 	,	and	 every 	 body 	 	 appreciate 	 s 	 	 every 	 body 	 	.	``	so	,	i	've	had	an	obsession	 bas 	 ically 	 	for	30	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	that	obsession	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	,	``	what	 make 	 s 	 	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	the	quality	of	 people 	 s 	 	 live 	 s 	 	?
what	 make 	 s 	 	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	performance	?	``	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	what	i	got	 hire 	 d 	 	to	do	.
i	've	got	to	produce	the	result	now	.
that	's	what	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	for	30	 year 	 s 	 	.	i	get	the	phone	call	when	the	athlete	is	 burn 	 ing 	 	down	on	national	 tele 	 vision 	 	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 a 	 head 	 	by	five	 stroke 	 s 	 	and	now	they	ca	n't	get	back	on	the	course	.
and	i	've	got	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	right	now	to	get	the	result	or	 noth 	 ing 	 	 matter 	 s 	 	.	i	get	the	phone	call	when	the	child	is	going	commit	 su 	 icide 	 	,	and	i	've	got	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	right	now	.	and	in	29	 year 	 s 	 	--	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	 grat 	 e 	 ful 	 	to	tell	you	i	've	never	lost	one	in	29	 year 	 s 	 	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	i	wo	n't	some	day	.	but	i	have	n't	 d 	 one 	 	it	,	and	the	reason	is	an	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	these	human	 need 	 s 	 	that	i	want	to	talk	to	you	about	.
so	,	when	i	get	 t 	 hose 	 	 call 	 s 	 	about	performance	,	that	's	one	thing	.
how	do	you	make	a	change	?
but	 al 	 so 	 	,	i	'm	looking	to	see	what	is	it	that	's	 sha 	 ping 	 	that	person	's	ability	to	 con 	 tribute 	 	,	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	beyond	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.	so	 may 	 be 	 	the	real	question	is	,	you	know	,	i	look	at	life	and	say	,	there	's	two	master	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	.
one	is	:	there	's	the	science	of	 achiev 	 ement 	 	,	which	 al 	 most 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	that	's	run	is	 master 	 ed 	 	to	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 ex 	 tent 	 	.
that	's	``	how	do	you	take	the	 in 	 visible 	 	and	make	it	visible	,	``	right	?
how	do	you	take	what	you	're	 dream 	 ing 	 	of	and	make	it	happen	?
 whet 	 her 	 	it	be	your	business	,	your	 con 	 trib 	 ution 	 	to	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	money	--	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	for	you	--	your	body	,	your	family	.	but	the	other	 less 	 on 	 	of	life	that	is	 rare 	 ly 	 	 master 	 ed 	 	is	the	art	of	 fulfill 	 ment 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	science	is	easy	,	right	?
we	know	the	 rule 	 s 	 	.	you	write	the	code	.	you	follow	the	--	and	you	get	the	 result 	 s 	 	.	once	you	know	the	game	you	just	,	you	know	,	you	up	the	 ant 	 e 	 	,	do	n't	you	?
but	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	 fulfill 	 ment 	 	--	that	's	an	art	.
and	the	reason	is	,	it	's	about	 appreci 	 ation 	 	and	it	's	about	 con 	 trib 	 ution 	 	.	you	can	 on 	 ly 	 	feel	so	much	by	 your 	 self 	 	.
so	,	i	've	had	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	 labor 	 atory 	 	to	try	to	answer	the	question	of	the	real	question	,	which	is	what	's	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	 some 	 body 	 	's	life	if	you	look	at	 some 	 body 	 	like	 t 	 hose 	 	people	that	you	've	 give 	 n 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	to	?	like	all	the	 resource 	 s 	 	they	say	they	need	.	you	 g 	 ave 	 	them	not	a	100	-	dollar	computer	;	you	 g 	 ave 	 	them	the	best	computer	.	you	 g 	 ave 	 	them	love	;	you	 g 	 ave 	 	them	joy	.	you	 we 	 re 	 	there	to	comfort	them	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	people	 ver 	 y 	 	often	--	and	you	know	some	of	them	,	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	--	end	up	the	rest	of	 the 	 ir 	 	life	with	all	 th 	 is 	 	love	,	education	,	money	and	 back 	 ground 	 	,	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	life	going	in	and	out	of	rehab	.	and	then	you	meet	people	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	through	ultimate	pain	--	 psycho 	 logically 	 	,	 sexual 	 ly 	 	,	 spiritual 	 ly 	 	,	 emotion 	 ally 	 	 abuse 	 d 	 	--	and	not	 al 	 ways 	 	,	but	often	,	they	 be 	 come 	 	some	of	the	people	that	 con 	 tribute 	 	the	most	to	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
so	,	the	question	we	've	got	to	ask	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	is	,	what	is	it	?
what	is	it	that	 shape 	 s 	 	us	?	and	we	live	in	a	therapy	culture	.
most	of	us	do	n't	do	that	,	but	the	culture	's	a	therapy	culture	.
and	what	i	mean	by	that	is	the	 mind 	 set 	 	that	we	are	our	past	.
and	 every 	 body 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	--	you	would	n't	be	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	if	you	 b 	 ought 	 	that	 theor 	 y 	 	--	but	the	--	most	of	 socie 	 ty 	 	 think 	 s 	 	 bio 	 graphy 	 	is	 de 	 s 	 tin 	 y 	 	.
the	past	 equal 	 s 	 	the	future	.	and	of	course	it	 do 	 es 	 	if	you	live	there	.
but	what	people	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	know	,	and	what	we	have	to	 re 	 mind 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	you	can	know	 some 	 thing 	 	 intellectual 	 ly 	 	,	you	can	know	what	to	do	and	then	not	use	it	,	not	 app 	 ly 	 	it	.
so	 re 	 ally 	 	,	we	're	going	to	 re 	 mind 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	that	decision	is	the	ultimate	power	.	that	's	what	it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	.
now	,	when	you	ask	people	,	you	know	,	have	you	 fail 	 ed 	 	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	?
how	 man 	 y 	 	have	ever	 fail 	 ed 	 	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	significant	in	your	life	?	say	,	``	aye	.	``	audience	:	aye	.
tr	:	 thank 	 s 	 	for	the	 interact 	 ion 	 	on	a	high	level	there	.
but	if	you	ask	people	,	why	did	n't	you	 achiev 	 e 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	?
 some 	 body 	 	who	's	 work 	 ing 	 	for	you	,	you	know	,	or	a	partner	,	or	even	 your 	 self 	 	.	when	you	fail	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	a	goal	,	what	's	the	reason	people	say	they	fail	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	?
what	do	they	tell	you	?	do	n't	have	the	--	did	n't	know	 en 	 ough 	 	,	did	n't	have	the	--	knowledge	.	did	n't	have	the	--	money	.
did	n't	have	the	--	time	.	did	n't	have	the	--	technology	.	you	know	,
i	did	n't	have	the	right	 manage 	 r 	 	.	did	n't	have	the	...	al	gore	:	 suprem 	 e 	 	court	.	tr	:	and	--	and	--	--	what	do	all	 t 	 hose 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	the	 suprem 	 e 	 	court	,	have	in	common	?
they	are	a	claim	to	you	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	,	and	they	may	be	accurate	.
you	may	not	have	the	money	;	you	may	not	have	the	 suprem 	 e 	 	court	;	but	that	is	not	the	 defi 	 ning 	 	factor	.
and	you	correct	me	if	i	'm	wrong	.
the	 defi 	 ning 	 	factor	is	never	 resource 	 s 	 	;	it	's	 resource 	 fulness 	 	.
and	what	i	mean	 specific 	 ally 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	just	some	phrase	,	is	if	you	have	emotion	,	human	emotion	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	 experience 	 d 	 	from	you	a	day	before	 yester 	 day 	 	at	a	level	that	is	 a 	 s 	 	 pro 	 found 	 	 a 	 s 	 	i	've	ever	 experience 	 d 	 	,	and	if	you	'd	 communicate 	 d 	 	with	that	emotion	i	 believ 	 e 	 	you	would	have	beat	his	ass	and	won	.
but	,	how	easy	for	me	to	tell	him	what	he	should	do	.
idiot	,	robbins	.	but	i	know	when	we	 watch 	 ed 	 	the	debate	at	that	time	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	 emotion 	 s 	 	that	 block 	 ed 	 	people	's	ability	to	get	 th 	 is 	 	man	's	 in 	 tell 	 ect 	 	and	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	.
and	the	way	that	it	came	 a 	 cross 	 	to	some	people	on	that	day	--	 be 	 cause 	 	i	know	people	that	 want 	 ed 	 	to	vote	in	your	direction	and	did	n't	,	and	i	was	 up 	 set 	 	.	but	there	was	emotion	that	was	there	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	know	what	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	here	?	say	,	``	aye	.	``
audience	:	aye	.
tr	:	so	,	emotion	is	it	.	and	if	we	get	the	right	emotion	,	we	can	get	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	do	 any 	 thing 	 	.	we	can	get	through	it	.
if	you	're	creative	 en 	 ough 	 	,	 play 	 ful 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	 f 	 un 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	can	you	get	through	to	 any 	 body 	 	?	 y 	 es 	 	or	no	?
audience	:	 y 	 es 	 	.	tr	:	if	you	do	n't	have	the	money	,	but	you	're	creative	and	 determine 	 d 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	you	find	the	way	.	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	ultimate	resource	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	the	story	that	people	tell	us	,	right	?
the	story	people	tell	us	is	a	bunch	of	different	 st 	 ories 	 	.
they	tell	us	we	do	n't	have	the	 resource 	 s 	 	,	but	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	if	you	take	a	look	here	--	flip	it	up	,	if	you	would	--	they	say	,	what	are	all	the	 reason 	 s 	 	they	have	n't	 accomplish 	 ed 	 	that	?
next	one	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	.	he	's	broken	my	pattern	,	that	son	-	of	-	a	-	bitch	.
but	i	 appreciate 	 d 	 	the	energy	,	i	'll	tell	you	that	.
what	 determine 	 s 	 	your	 resource 	 s 	 	?	we	've	 s 	 aid 	 	 decision 	 s 	 	shape	 de 	 s 	 tin 	 y 	 	,	which	is	my	focus	here	.	if	 decision 	 s 	 	shape	 de 	 s 	 tin 	 y 	 	,	what	 determine 	 s 	 	it	is	three	 decision 	 s 	 	.	what	are	you	going	to	focus	on	?
right	now	,	you	have	to	decide	what	you	're	going	to	focus	on	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	second	,	 conscious 	 ly 	 	or	 un 	 conscious 	 ly 	 	,	the	minute	you	decide	to	focus	on	 some 	 thing 	 	you	've	got	to	give	it	a	meaning	,	and	 what 	 ever 	 	that	meaning	is	 produce 	 s 	 	emotion	.
is	 th 	 is 	 	the	end	or	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	?	is	god	 punish 	 ing 	 	me	or	 reward 	 ing 	 	me	,	or	is	 th 	 is 	 	the	roll	of	the	 d 	 ice 	 	?
an	emotion	,	then	,	 create 	 s 	 	what	we	're	going	to	do	or	the	action	.
so	,	think	about	your	own	life	,
the	 decision 	 s 	 	that	have	shaped	your	 de 	 s 	 tin 	 y 	 	.
and	that	 sound 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	heavy	,	but	in	the	last	five	or	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	15	 year 	 s 	 	,	how	have	there	 be 	 en 	 	some	 decision 	 s 	 	you	've	made	that	if	you	'd	made	a	different	decision	,	your	life	would	be	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	?	how	 man 	 y 	 	can	think	about	it	?
 honest 	 ly 	 	,	better	or	 wo 	 rse 	 	?	say	,	``	aye	.	``
audience	:	aye	.	tr	:	so	the	bottom	line	is	,	 may 	 be 	 	it	was	where	to	go	to	work	,	and	you	met	the	love	of	your	life	there	.
 may 	 be 	 	it	was	a	 care 	 er 	 	decision	.	i	know	the	google	 gen 	 ius 	 es 	 	i	saw	here	--	i	mean	,	i	understand	that	 the 	 ir 	 	decision	was	to	sell	 the 	 ir 	 	technology	at	first	.	what	if	they	made	that	decision	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	to	build	 the 	 ir 	 	own	culture	?	how	would	the	world	be	different	?
how	would	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	be	different	?	 the 	 ir 	 	impact	?
the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	our	world	is	these	 decision 	 s 	 	.
when	a	woman	 stand 	 s 	 	up	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	no	,	i	wo	n't	go	to	the	back	of	the	bus	,	``	she	did	n't	just	affect	her	life	.	that	decision	shaped	our	culture	.

you	've	got	it	in	your	brain	;	you	've	got	it	in	your	 lung 	 s 	 	.
but	what	was	his	decision	of	what	to	focus	on	?
different	than	most	people	.	what	did	it	mean	?
it	was	n't	the	end	;	it	was	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	.	what	am	i	going	to	do	?

when	we	want	to	influence	 some 	 body 	 	,	we	've	got	to	know	what	 al 	 ready 	 	 influence 	 s 	 	them	.
and	it	's	made	up	of	three	 part 	 s 	 	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	.
first	,	what	's	your	target	?	what	are	you	after	?
which	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	--	it	's	not	your	 desir 	 es 	 	.
you	can	get	your	 desir 	 es 	 	or	 goal 	 s 	 	.	how	 man 	 y 	 	have	ever	got	a	goal	or	 desir 	 e 	 	and	thought	,	is	 th 	 is 	 	all	there	is	?
how	 man 	 y 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	there	?	say	,	``	aye	.	``	audience	:	aye	.
tr	:	so	,	it	's	 need 	 s 	 	we	have	.	i	 believ 	 e 	 	there	are	six	human	 need 	 s 	 	.
second	,	once	you	know	what	the	target	that	's	 driv 	 ing 	 	you	is	and	you	 un 	 cover 	 	it	for	the	truth	--	you	do	n't	form	it	;	you	 un 	 cover 	 	it	--	then	you	find	out	what	's	your	map	,	what	's	the	belief	 system 	 s 	 	that	are	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	how	to	get	 t 	 hose 	 	 need 	 s 	 	.
some	people	think	the	way	to	get	 t 	 hose 	 	 need 	 s 	 	is	destroy	the	world	,	some	people	is	to	build	 some 	 thing 	 	,	create	 some 	 thing 	 	,	love	 some 	 one 	 	.
and	then	there	's	the	fuel	you	pick	.	so	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	six	 need 	 s 	 	.
let	me	tell	you	what	they	are	.	first	one	:	 certain 	 ty 	 	.
now	,	these	are	not	 goal 	 s 	 	or	 desir 	 es 	 	,	these	are	universal	.
 every 	 one 	 	 need 	 s 	 	 certain 	 ty 	 	that	they	can	avoid	pain	and	at	 l 	 east 	 	be	 comfort 	 able 	 	.	now	,	how	do	you	get	it	?
control	 every 	 body 	 	?	develop	a	skill	?	give	up	?	smoke	a	 cigar 	 ette 	 	?
and	if	you	got	 total 	 ly 	 	certain	,	 iron 	 ically 	 	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	we	all	need	that	--	like	if	you	're	not	certain	about	your	health	,	or	your	children	,	or	money	,	you	do	n't	think	about	much	.
you	're	not	 s 	 ure 	 	if	the	 ceil 	 ing 	 	's	going	to	hold	up	,	you	're	not	going	to	listen	to	any	speaker	.
but	,	while	we	go	for	 certain 	 ty 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	,	if	we	get	total	 certain 	 ty 	 	,	we	get	what	?	what	do	you	feel	if	you	're	certain	?
you	know	what	's	going	to	happen	,	when	it	's	going	to	happen	,
how	it	's	going	to	happen	--	what	would	you	feel	?
 bor 	 ed 	 	out	of	your	 mind 	 s 	 	.	so	,	god	,	in	her	infinite	 wis 	 dom 	 	,	 g 	 ave 	 	us	a	second	human	need	,	which	is	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	.
we	need	 varie 	 ty 	 	.	we	need	surprise	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	here	love	 surprise 	 s 	 	?	say	,	``	aye	.	``	audience	:	aye	.
tr	:	 bull 	 shit 	 	.	you	like	the	 surprise 	 s 	 	you	want	.
the	 one 	 s 	 	you	do	n't	want	you	call	 problem 	 s 	 	,	but	you	need	them	.
so	,	 varie 	 ty 	 	is	 import 	 ant 	 	.	have	you	ever	 rent 	 ed 	 	a	video	or	a	film	that	you	've	 al 	 ready 	 	 s 	 een 	 	?	who	's	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	?	get	a	 fuck 	 ing 	 	life	.
all	right	.	why	are	you	 do 	 ing 	 	it	?	you	're	certain	it	's	good	 be 	 cause 	 	you	read	it	before	,	saw	it	before	,	but	you	're	 hop 	 ing 	 	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	long	 en 	 ough 	 	you	've	 for 	 gotten 	 	,	that	there	's	 varie 	 ty 	 	.
third	human	need	,	critical	:	 sign 	 ific 	 ance 	 	.	we	all	need	to	feel	 import 	 ant 	 	,	special	,	 un 	 ique 	 	.	you	can	get	it	by	making	more	money	.
you	can	do	it	by	 be 	 ing 	 	more	spiritual	.	you	can	do	it	by	 get 	 ting 	 	 your 	 self 	 	in	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	where	you	put	more	 tattoo 	 s 	 	and	 ear 	 ring 	 s 	 	in	 place 	 s 	 	 human 	 s 	 	do	n't	want	to	know	.
 what 	 ever 	 	it	 take 	 s 	 	.	the	 fast 	 est 	 	way	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	if	you	have	no	 back 	 ground 	 	,	no	culture	,	no	belief	and	 resource 	 s 	 	or	 resource 	 fulness 	 	,	is	violence	.	if	i	put	a	gun	to	your	head	and	i	live	in	the	'	hood	,	 instant 	 ly 	 	i	'm	significant	.
zero	to	10.	how	high	?	10.	how	certain	am	i	that	you	're	going	to	respond	to	me	?	10.	how	much	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	?
who	 know 	 s 	 	what	's	going	to	happen	next	?	kind	of	 excit 	 ing 	 	.
like	 climb 	 ing 	 	up	 in 	 to 	 	a	cave	and	 do 	 ing 	 	that	stuff	all	the	way	down	there	.	total	 varie 	 ty 	 	and	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	.
and	it	's	significant	,	is	n't	it	?	so	you	want	to	risk	your	life	for	it	.
so	that	's	why	violence	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	around	and	will	be	around	 un 	 less 	 	we	have	a	 conscious 	 ness 	 	change	 a 	 s 	 	a	species	.
now	,	you	can	get	 sign 	 ific 	 ance 	 	a	million	ways	,	but	to	be	significant	,	you	've	got	to	be	 un 	 ique 	 	and	different	.
here	's	what	we	 re 	 ally 	 	need	:	 connect 	 ion 	 	and	love	--	fourth	need	.
we	all	want	it	.	most	people	settle	for	 connect 	 ion 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	love	's	too	 scar 	 y 	 	.	do	n't	want	to	get	hurt	.
who	here	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	 be 	 en 	 	hurt	in	an	 intima 	 te 	 	relationship	?	say	,	``	aye	.	``
if	you	do	n't	raise	your	hand	,	you	'll	have	had	other	shit	too	,	come	on	.
and	you	're	going	to	get	hurt	 aga 	 in 	 	.
are	n't	you	glad	you	came	to	 th 	 is 	 	positive	visit	?
but	here	's	what	's	true	--	we	need	it	.	we	can	do	it	through	 in 	 timacy 	 	,	through	 friend 	 ship 	 	,	through	 pray 	 er 	 	,	through	 walk 	 ing 	 	in	nature	.
if	 noth 	 ing 	 	else	 work 	 s 	 	for	you	,	get	a	dog	.	do	n't	get	a	cat	.	get	a	dog	,
 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	 leav 	 e 	 	for	two	 minute 	 s 	 	,	it	's	like	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	gone	for	six	 month 	 s 	 	when	you	show	back	up	 aga 	 in 	 	five	 minute 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	right	?
now	,	these	first	four	 need 	 s 	 	,	every	human	 find 	 s 	 	a	way	to	meet	.
even	if	you	lie	to	 your 	 self 	 	,	you	need	to	have	split	 personal 	 ities 	 	.
but	the	last	two	 need 	 s 	 	--	the	first	four	 need 	 s 	 	are	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 need 	 s 	 	of	the	 personal 	 ities 	 	,	is	what	i	call	it	--	the	last	two	are	the	 need 	 s 	 	of	the	spirit	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	 fulfill 	 ment 	 	 come 	 s 	 	.	you	wo	n't	get	 fulfill 	 ment 	 	from	the	first	four	.	you	'll	figure	a	way	--	smoke	,	drink	,	do	 what 	 ever 	 	--	to	meet	the	first	four	,	but	the	last	two	--	number	five	:	you	must	grow	.	we	all	know	the	answer	here	.
if	you	do	n't	grow	,	you	're	what	?	if	a	relationship	's	not	growing	,	if	a	business	is	not	growing	,	if	you	're	not	growing	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	how	much	money	you	have	,	how	 man 	 y 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	you	have	,	how	 man 	 y 	 	people	love	you	,	you	feel	like	hell	.	and	the	reason	we	grow	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	is	so	we	have	 some 	 thing 	 	to	give	of	value	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	sixth	need	is	to	 con 	 tribute 	 	beyond	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	all	know	,	 corn 	 y 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	 sound 	 s 	 	,	the	secret	to	living	is	giving	.	we	all	know	life	's	not	about	me	;	it	's	about	we	.	 th 	 is 	 	culture	 know 	 s 	 	that	.	 th 	 is 	 	room	 know 	 s 	 	that	.
and	it	's	 excit 	 ing 	 	.	when	you	see	nicholas	up	here	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	his	$	100	computer	,	the	most	passionate	 excit 	 ing 	 	thing	is	:	here	's	a	 gen 	 ius 	 	,	but	he	's	got	a	 call 	 ing 	 	now	.
you	can	feel	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	him	and	it	's	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
and	that	 call 	 ing 	 	can	touch	other	people	.	in	my	own	life	,	my	life	was	 touch 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	when	i	was	11	 year 	 s 	 	old	,
 thank 	 s 	 giving 	 	,	no	money	,	no	food	--	we	're	not	going	to	 starv 	 e 	 	,	but	my	father	was	 total 	 ly 	 	 mess 	 ed 	 	up	.	my	mom	was	 lett 	 ing 	 	him	know	how	bad	he	 mess 	 ed 	 	up	.	and	 some 	 body 	 	came	to	the	door	and	 deliver 	 ed 	 	food	.	my	father	made	three	 decision 	 s 	 	.
i	know	what	they	 we 	 re 	 	 brief 	 ly 	 	.	his	focus	was	:	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	 char 	 ity 	 	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	it	mean	?	i	'm	 worth 	 less 	 	.	what	've	i	got	to	do	?	 leav 	 e 	 	my	family	.	``	which	he	did	.	the	time	was	one	of	the	most	 pain 	 ful 	 	 experience 	 s 	 	of	life	.	my	three	 decision 	 s 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	me	a	different	path	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	focus	on	:	'	there	's	food	'	``	--	what	a	 con 	 cept 	 	,	you	know	.
second	--	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 change 	 d 	 	my	life	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	shaped	me	 a 	 s 	 	a	human	 be 	 ing 	 	--	``	 some 	 body 	 	's	gift	.	i	do	n't	even	know	who	it	is	.	``	my	father	 al 	 ways 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	one	 give 	 s 	 	a	shit	.	``	and	all	of	a	sudden	,	 some 	 body 	 	i	do	n't	know	,	they	're	not	 ask 	 ing 	 	for	 any 	 thing 	 	,	they	're	just	giving	our	family	food	,	looking	out	for	us	.	it	made	me	 believ 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	:	``	what	 do 	 es 	 	it	mean	that	 strange 	 rs 	 	care	?	``	and	what	that	made	me	decide	is	,	if	 strange 	 rs 	 	care	about	me	and	my	family	,	i	care	about	them	.
what	am	i	going	to	do	?	i	'm	going	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	to	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	.	so	,	when	i	was	17	,	i	went	out	one	day	on	 thank 	 s 	 giving 	 	.	it	was	my	target	for	 year 	 s 	 	to	have	 en 	 ough 	 	money	to	feed	two	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	.
the	most	 f 	 un 	 	thing	i	ever	did	in	my	life	,	the	most	moving	.
then	next	year	i	did	four	.	i	did	n't	tell	 any 	 body 	 	what	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	.
next	year	eight	.	i	was	n't	 do 	 ing 	 	it	for	brownie	 point 	 s 	 	,	but	after	eight	,	i	thought	,	shit	,	i	could	use	some	help	.
so	 s 	 ure 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	i	went	out	and	what	did	i	do	?
i	got	my	 friend 	 s 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	and	i	grew	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	and	then	i	got	11	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	and	i	built	the	 found 	 ation 	 	.
now	,	18	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	i	'm	proud	to	tell	you	,	last	year	we	fed	two	million	people	in	35	 count 	 ries 	 	through	our	 found 	 ation 	 	,	all	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	 holi 	 day 	 s 	 	:	 thank 	 s 	 giving 	 	,	christmas	--	--	in	all	the	different	 count 	 ries 	 	around	the	world	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	fantastic	.
thank	you	.
so	,	i	do	n't	tell	you	that	to	brag	;	i	tell	you	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	proud	of	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	get	 excit 	 ed 	 	to	 con 	 tribute 	 	once	they	've	had	the	chance	to	experience	it	,	not	talk	about	it	.
so	,	 final 	 ly 	 	--	and	i	'm	about	out	of	time	--	the	target	that	 shape 	 s 	 	you	--	here	's	what	's	different	about	people	.	we	have	the	same	 need 	 s 	 	,	but	are	you	a	 certain 	 ty 	 	freak	?	is	that	what	you	value	most	,	or	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	?	 th 	 is 	 	man	here	could	n't	be	a	 certain 	 ty 	 	freak	if	he	 climb 	 ed 	 	through	 t 	 hose 	 	 cave 	 s 	 	.	are	you	driven	by	 sign 	 ific 	 ance 	 	or	love	?	we	all	need	all	six	,	but	 what 	 ever 	 	your	lead	system	is	,	 tilt 	 s 	 	you	in	a	different	direction	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	move	in	a	direction	,	you	have	a	destination	or	 de 	 s 	 tin 	 y 	 	.
the	second	piece	is	the	map	.	think	of	that	 a 	 s 	 	the	 oper 	 ating 	 	system	that	 tell 	 s 	 	you	how	to	get	there	.	and	some	people	's	map	is	:	``	i	'm	going	to	 s 	 ave 	 	 live 	 s 	 	even	if	i	die	for	other	people	,	``	and	they	're	 fire 	 men 	 	.	 some 	 body 	 	else	is	:	``	i	'm	going	to	kill	people	to	do	it	.	``	they	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	meet	the	same	 need 	 s 	 	of	 sign 	 ific 	 ance 	 	,	right	?	they	want	to	honor	god	or	honor	 the 	 ir 	 	family	,	but	they	have	a	different	map	.
and	there	are	seven	different	 belief 	 s 	 	.	i	ca	n't	go	through	them	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	 d 	 one 	 	.	the	last	piece	is	emotion	.
i	'd	say	one	of	the	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	map	is	like	time	.	some	people	's	idea	of	a	long	time	is	100	 year 	 s 	 	.	 some 	 body 	 	else	's	is	three	 second 	 s 	 	,	which	is	what	i	have	.
and	the	last	one	i	've	 al 	 ready 	 	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	,	that	fell	to	you	.
if	you	've	got	a	target	and	you	've	got	a	map	and	let	's	say	--	i	ca	n't	use	google	 be 	 cause 	 	i	love	macs	and	they	have	n't	made	it	good	for	macs	yet	--	so	if	you	use	mapquest	--	how	 man 	 y 	 	have	made	 th 	 is 	 	fatal	 mistak 	 e 	 	of	using	mapquest	at	some	time	?
you	use	 th 	 is 	 	thing	and	you	do	n't	get	there	.	well	,	imagine	if	your	 belief 	 s 	 	guarantee	you	can	never	get	to	where	you	want	to	go	?
the	last	thing	is	emotion	.
now	,	here	's	what	i	'll	tell	you	about	emotion	.	there	are	6,000	 emotion 	 s 	 	that	we	all	have	 word 	 s 	 	for	in	the	english	language	,	which	is	just	a	 linguist 	 ic 	 	 represent 	 ation 	 	,	right	,	that	 change 	 s 	 	by	language	.	but	if	your	 domin 	 ant 	 	 emotion 	 s 	 	--	if	i	had	more	time	,	i	have	20,000	people	or	1,000	,	and	i	have	them	write	down	all	the	 emotion 	 s 	 	that	they	experience	in	an	average	week	,	and	i	 g 	 ave 	 	them	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	they	 need 	 ed 	 	,
and	on	one	side	they	write	 empower 	 ing 	 	 emotion 	 s 	 	,	the	other	's	disempowering	--
guess	how	 man 	 y 	 	 emotion 	 s 	 	people	experience	?	less	than	12	.
and	half	of	 t 	 hose 	 	make	them	feel	like	shit	.	so	they	got	five	or	six	good	 f 	 rick 	 in 	 	'	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	right	?	it	's	like	they	feel	``	happy	,	happy	,	 excit 	 ed 	 	,	oh	shit	,	 frust 	 rated 	 	,	 frust 	 rated 	 	,	 overwhelm 	 ed 	 	,	 depress 	 ed 	 	.	``	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	know	 some 	 body 	 	who	no	matter	what	 happen 	 s 	 	 find 	 s 	 	a	way	to	get	 piss 	 ed 	 	off	?	how	 man 	 y 	 	know	 some 	 body 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	?
or	,	no	matter	what	 happen 	 s 	 	,	they	find	a	way	to	be	happy	or	 excit 	 ed 	 	.
how	may	know	 some 	 body 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	?	come	on	.
when	9/11	 happen 	 ed 	 	--	i	'll	finish	with	 th 	 is 	 	--	i	was	in	hawaii	.
