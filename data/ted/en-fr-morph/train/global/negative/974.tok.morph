we	are	here	 to 	 day 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	[	the	]	 unit 	 ed 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	have	defined	 goal 	 s 	 	for	the	progress	of	 count 	 ries 	 	.
they	're	 call 	 ed 	 	 mill 	 e 	 nnium 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	 goal 	 s 	 	.
and	the	reason	i	 re 	 ally 	 	like	these	 goal 	 s 	 	is	that	there	are	eight	of	them	.
and	by	 spec 	 ifying 	 	eight	different	 goal 	 s 	 	,	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	that	there	are	so	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	to	change	in	a	country	in	order	to	get	the	good	life	for	people	.
look	here	--	you	have	to	end	poverty	,	education	,	gender	,	child	and	 ma 	 ternal 	 	health	,	control	 infect 	 ions 	 	,	protect	the	environment	and	get	the	good	global	 link 	 s 	 	between	 nation 	 s 	 	in	every	 a 	 spect 	 	from	aid	to	trade	.
there	's	a	second	reason	i	like	these	 develop 	 ment 	 	 goal 	 s 	 	,	and	that	is	 be 	 cause 	 	each	and	every	one	is	 measur 	 ed 	 	.
take	child	 mortal 	 ity 	 	;
the	aim	here	is	to	 reduc 	 e 	 	child	 mortal 	 ity 	 	by	two	-	 third 	 s 	 	,	from	1990	to	2015	.
that	's	a	four	percent	 r 	 eduction 	 	per	year	--
and	 th 	 is 	 	,	with	 measur 	 ing 	 	.	that	's	what	 make 	 s 	 	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	 politic 	 al 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	and	 re 	 ally 	 	going	for	the	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	,	a	better	life	for	people	.
and	what	i	'm	so	happy	about	with	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	we	have	 al 	 ready 	 	 document 	 ed 	 	that	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	in	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	,	in	the	middle	east	,	in	latin	america	and	east	europe	that	[	are	]	 reduc 	 ing 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	rate	.
and	even	 might 	 y 	 	brazil	is	going	down	with	five	percent	per	year	,	and	 tur 	 key 	 	with	seven	percent	per	year	.
so	there	's	good	news	.
but	then	i	hear	people	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	there	is	no	progress	in	africa	.
and	there	's	not	even	 statistic 	 s 	 	on	africa	to	know	what	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	.	``
i	'll	prove	them	wrong	on	both	 point 	 s 	 	.
come	with	me	to	the	 wonder 	 ful 	 	world	of	 statistic 	 s 	 	.
i	 br 	 ing 	 	you	to	the	 web 	 page 	 	,	childmortality.org	,	where	you	can	take	 death 	 s 	 	in	children	 be 	 low 	 	five	 year 	 s 	 	of	age	for	all	 count 	 ries 	 	--
it	's	 d 	 one 	 	by	u.n.	 special 	 ists 	 	.
and	i	will	take	kenya	 a 	 s 	 	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
here	you	see	the	data	.
do	n't	panic	--	do	n't	panic	now	,	i	'll	help	you	through	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	 look 	 s 	 	nasty	,	like	in	college	when	you	did	n't	like	 statistic 	 s 	 	.
but	first	thing	,	when	you	see	 dot 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	have	to	ask	 your 	 self 	 	:	from	where	do	the	data	come	?
what	is	the	origin	of	the	data	?
is	it	so	that	in	kenya	,	there	are	 doctor 	 s 	 	and	other	 special 	 ists 	 	who	write	the	death	certificate	at	the	death	of	the	child	and	it	's	 s 	 ent 	 	to	the	 statistic 	 al 	 	 off 	 ice 	 	?
no	--	low	-	income	 count 	 ries 	 	like	kenya	still	do	n't	have	that	level	of	 organ 	 ization 	 	.
it	 exist 	 s 	 	,	but	it	's	not	complete	 be 	 cause 	 	so	 man 	 y 	 	 death 	 s 	 	occur	in	the	home	with	the	family	,	and	it	's	not	 register 	 ed 	 	.
what	we	 re 	 ly 	 	on	is	not	an	 in 	 complete 	 	system	.
we	have	 interview 	 s 	 	,	we	have	 survey 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 high 	 ly 	 	professional	female	 interview 	 ers 	 	who	 s 	 it 	 	down	for	one	hour	with	a	woman	and	ask	her	about	[	her	]	birth	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	children	did	you	have	?
are	they	 al 	 ive 	 	?
if	they	 di 	 ed 	 	,	at	what	age	and	what	year	?
and	then	 th 	 is 	 	is	 d 	 one 	 	in	a	 represent 	 ative 	 	 s 	 ample 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	women	in	the	country	and	put	together	in	what	used	to	be	 call 	 ed 	 	a	 demo 	 graphic 	 	health	survey	report	.
but	these	 survey 	 s 	 	are	 cost 	 ly 	 	,	so	they	can	 on 	 ly 	 	be	 d 	 one 	 	[	in	]	three	-	to	five	-	year	 inter 	 val 	 s 	 	.
but	they	have	good	quality	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 limit 	 ation 	 	.
and	all	these	 color 	 ed 	 	lines	here	are	 result 	 s 	 	;	each	color	is	one	survey	.
but	that	's	too	 complic 	 ated 	 	for	 to 	 day 	 	,	so	i	'll	 simpl 	 ify 	 	it	for	you	,	and	i	give	you	one	average	point	for	each	survey	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	1977	,	1988	,	1992	,	'97	and	2002	.
and	when	the	 expert 	 s 	 	in	the	u.n.	have	got	these	 survey 	 s 	 	in	place	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 data 	 base 	 	,	then	they	use	 advance 	 d 	 	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 formula 	 s 	 	to	produce	a	trend	line	,	and	the	trend	line	 look 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
see	here	--	it	's	the	best	fit	they	can	get	of	 th 	 is 	 	point	.
but	watch	out	--
they	 continu 	 e 	 	the	line	beyond	the	last	point	out	 in 	 to 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
and	they	 estimate 	 d 	 	that	in	2008	,	kenya	had	per	child	 mortal 	 ity 	 	of	128	.
and	i	was	 s 	 ad 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	could	see	 th 	 is 	 	 revers 	 al 	 	in	kenya	with	an	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	child	 mortal 	 ity 	 	in	the	90s	.
it	was	so	tragic	.
but	in	june	,	i	got	a	mail	in	my	 in 	 box 	 	from	 demo 	 graphic 	 	health	 survey 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 show 	 ed 	 	good	news	from	kenya	.
i	was	so	happy	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	the	estimate	of	the	new	survey	.
then	it	just	took	 an 	 other 	 	three	 month 	 s 	 	for	[	the	]	u.n.	to	get	it	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 serv 	 er 	 	,	and	on	friday	we	got	the	new	trend	line	--
it	was	down	here	.
is	n't	it	nice	--	is	n't	it	nice	,	 yea 	 h 	 	?
i	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	on	friday	,	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	front	of	my	computer	,	and	i	saw	the	death	rate	fall	from	128	to	84	just	that	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
so	we	 celebr 	 ated 	 	.
but	now	,	when	you	have	 th 	 is 	 	trend	line	,	how	do	we	measure	progress	?
i	'm	going	 in 	 to 	 	some	 detail 	 s 	 	here	,	 be 	 cause 	 	[	the	]	u.n.	do	it	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
they	start	[	in	]	1990	--	they	measure	to	2009	.
they	say	,	``	0.9	percent	,	no	progress	.	``
that	's	 un 	 fair 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	professor	,	i	think	i	have	the	right	to	 pro 	 pose 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	.
i	would	say	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	do	 th 	 is 	 	--
10	 year 	 s 	 	is	 en 	 ough 	 	to	follow	the	trend	.
it	's	two	 survey 	 s 	 	,	and	you	can	see	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	now	.
they	have	2.4	percent	.
had	i	 be 	 en 	 	in	the	 mini 	 stry 	 	of	health	in	kenya	,	i	may	have	 join 	 ed 	 	these	two	 point 	 s 	 	.
so	what	i	'm	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	is	that	we	know	the	child	 mortal 	 ity 	 	.
we	have	a	 de 	 cent 	 	trend	.
it	's	coming	 in 	 to 	 	some	 trick 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	then	when	we	are	 measur 	 ing 	 	mdgs	.
and	the	reason	here	for	africa	is	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	'90s	was	a	bad	decade	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	in	kenya	,	but	 a 	 cross 	 	africa	.
the	hiv	 epi 	 demic 	 	 peak 	 ed 	 	.
there	was	 resist 	 ance 	 	for	the	old	malaria	 drug 	 s 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	we	got	the	new	 drug 	 s 	 	.
we	got	,	 lat 	 er 	 	,	the	mosquito	 nett 	 ing 	 	.
and	there	was	socio	-	economic	 problem 	 s 	 	,	which	are	now	 be 	 ing 	 	 solve 	 d 	 	at	a	much	better	scale	.
so	look	at	the	average	here	--
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	average	for	all	of	sub	-	saharan	africa	.
and	[	the	]	u.n.	 say 	 s 	 	it	's	a	 r 	 eduction 	 	with	1.8	percent	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	 sound 	 s 	 	a	little	 theoretic 	 al 	 	,	but	it	's	not	so	 theoretic 	 al 	 	.
you	know	,	these	 economist 	 s 	 	,	they	love	money	,	they	want	more	and	more	of	it	,	they	want	it	to	grow	.
so	they	 calcul 	 ate 	 	the	percent	annual	growth	rate	of	[	the	]	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
we	in	public	health	,	we	hate	child	death	,	so	we	want	less	and	less	and	less	of	child	 death 	 s 	 	.
so	we	 calcul 	 ate 	 	the	percent	 r 	 eduction 	 	per	year	,
but	it	's	sort	of	the	same	 percent 	 age 	 	.
if	your	 eco 	 nomy 	 	 grow 	 s 	 	with	four	percent	,	you	ought	to	 reduc 	 e 	 	child	 mortal 	 ity 	 	four	percent	;	if	it	's	used	well	and	people	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	and	can	get	the	use	of	the	 resource 	 s 	 	in	the	way	they	want	it	.
so	is	 th 	 is 	 	fair	now	to	measure	 th 	 is 	 	over	19	 year 	 s 	 	?
an	economist	would	never	do	that	.
i	have	just	 divid 	 ed 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	two	 period 	 s 	 	.
in	the	90s	,	 on 	 ly 	 	1.2	percent	,	 on 	 ly 	 	1.2	percent	.
 where 	 a 	 s 	 	now	,	second	gear	--	it	's	like	africa	had	first	gear	,	now	they	go	 in 	 to 	 	second	gear	.
but	even	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	fair	 represent 	 ation 	 	of	africa	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	an	average	,	it	's	an	average	speed	of	 r 	 eduction 	 	in	africa	.
and	look	here	when	i	take	you	 in 	 to 	 	my	bubble	 graph 	 s 	 	.
still	here	,	child	death	per	1,000	on	that	axis	.
here	we	have	[	the	]	year	.
and	i	'm	now	giving	you	a	 wide 	 r 	 	picture	than	the	mdg	.
i	start	50	 year 	 s 	 	ago	when	africa	 celebr 	 ated 	 	 in 	 depend 	 ence 	 	in	most	 count 	 ries 	 	.
i	give	you	congo	,	which	was	high	,	ghana	--	lower	.	and	kenya	--	even	lower	.
and	what	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	over	the	 year 	 s 	 	since	then	?	here	we	go	.
you	can	see	,	with	 in 	 depend 	 ence 	 	,	 liter 	 acy 	 	 improv 	 ed 	 	and	 vaccin 	 ations 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	,	 small 	 pox 	 	was	 eradic 	 ated 	 	,	 hygien 	 e 	 	was	 improv 	 ed 	 	,	and	 thing 	 s 	 	got	better	.
but	then	,	in	the	'80s	,	watch	out	here	.
congo	got	 in 	 to 	 	civil	war	,	and	they	 level 	 ed 	 	off	here	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	the	 back 	 lash 	 	in	kenya	,	and	ghana	 bypass 	 ed 	 	,	but	then	kenya	and	ghana	go	down	together	--	still	a	 stand 	 still 	 	in	congo	.
that	's	where	we	are	 to 	 day 	 	.
you	can	see	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	sense	to	make	an	average	of	 th 	 is 	 	zero	 improve 	 ment 	 	and	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	fast	 improve 	 ment 	 	.
time	 ha 	 s 	 	come	to	stop	 think 	 ing 	 	about	sub	-	saharan	africa	 a 	 s 	 	one	place	.
 the 	 ir 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	are	so	different	,	and	they	merit	to	be	 recogn 	 ized 	 	in	the	same	way	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	do	n't	talk	about	europe	 a 	 s 	 	one	place	.
i	can	tell	you	that	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	in	greece	and	sweden	are	 ver 	 y 	 	different	--
 every 	 one 	 	 know 	 s 	 	that	.
and	they	are	 judg 	 ed 	 	,	each	country	,	on	how	they	are	 do 	 ing 	 	.
so	let	me	show	the	 wide 	 r 	 	picture	.
my	country	,	sweden	:	1800	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	up	there	.
what	a	strange	 personal 	 ity 	 	 dis 	 order 	 	we	must	have	,	 count 	 ing 	 	the	children	so	 meticulous 	 ly 	 	in	spite	of	a	high	child	death	rate	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	strange	.	it	's	sort	of	 embarrass 	 ing 	 	.
but	we	had	that	habit	in	sweden	,	you	know	,	that	we	 count 	 ed 	 	all	the	child	 death 	 s 	 	,	even	if	we	did	n't	do	 any 	 thing 	 	about	it	.
and	then	,	you	see	,	these	 we 	 re 	 	famine	 year 	 s 	 	.
these	 we 	 re 	 	bad	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	people	got	fed	up	with	sweden	.
my	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	 move 	 d 	 	to	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	soon	they	 start 	 ed 	 	to	get	better	and	better	here	.
and	here	we	got	better	education	,	and	we	got	health	service	,	and	child	 mortal 	 ity 	 	came	down	.
we	never	had	a	war	;	sweden	was	in	peace	all	 th 	 is 	 	time	.
but	look	,	the	rate	of	 lower 	 ing 	 	in	sweden	was	not	fast	.
sweden	 achiev 	 ed 	 	a	low	child	 mortal 	 ity 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 start 	 ed 	 	early	.
we	had	 prim 	 ary 	 	school	 actual 	 ly 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	in	1842	.
and	then	you	get	that	 wonder 	 ful 	 	effect	when	we	got	female	 liter 	 acy 	 	one	generation	 lat 	 er 	 	.
you	have	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	the	 invest 	 ments 	 	we	do	in	progress	are	long	-	term	 invest 	 ments 	 	.
it	's	not	about	just	five	 year 	 s 	 	--
it	's	long	-	term	 invest 	 ments 	 	.
and	sweden	never	 reach 	 ed 	 	[	the	]	 mill 	 e 	 nnium 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	goal	rate	,	3.1	percent	when	i	 calcul 	 ated 	 	.
so	we	are	off	track	--	that	's	what	sweden	is	.
but	you	do	n't	talk	about	it	so	much	.
we	want	 other 	 s 	 	to	be	better	than	we	 we 	 re 	 	,	and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	 other 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	better	.
let	me	show	you	thailand	,	see	what	a	success	story	,	thailand	from	the	1960s	--	how	they	went	down	here	and	 reach 	 ed 	 	 al 	 most 	 	the	same	child	 mortal 	 ity 	 	 level 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	sweden	.
and	i	'll	give	you	 an 	 other 	 	story	--	egypt	,	the	most	 hid 	 den 	 	,	 glor 	 ious 	 	success	in	public	health	.
egypt	was	up	here	in	1960	,	 high 	 er 	 	than	congo	.
the	nile	 del 	 ta 	 	was	a	 mis 	 ery 	 	for	children	with	 dia 	 rrhea 	 l 	 	disease	and	malaria	and	a	lot	of	 problem 	 s 	 	.
and	then	they	got	the	aswan	dam	.	they	got	 electric 	 ity 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 home 	 s 	 	,
they	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	education
and	they	got	 prim 	 ary 	 	health	care	.
and	down	they	went	,	you	know	.
and	they	got	 safe 	 r 	 	water	,	they	 eradic 	 ated 	 	malaria	.
and	is	n't	it	a	success	story	.
 mill 	 e 	 nnium 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	goal	rates	for	child	 mortal 	 ity 	 	is	fully	possible	.
and	the	good	thing	is	that	ghana	 to 	 day 	 	is	going	with	the	same	rate	 a 	 s 	 	egypt	did	at	 it 	 s 	 	 fast 	 est 	 	.
kenya	is	now	 speed 	 ing 	 	up	.
here	we	have	a	problem	.
we	have	a	severe	problem	in	 count 	 ries 	 	which	are	at	a	 stand 	 still 	 	.
now	,	let	me	now	 br 	 ing 	 	you	to	a	 wide 	 r 	 	picture	,	a	 wide 	 r 	 	picture	of	child	 mortal 	 ity 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	show	you	the	relationship	between	child	 mortal 	 ity 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	axis	here	--	 th 	 is 	 	axis	here	is	child	 mortal 	 ity 	 	--	and	here	i	have	the	family	 s 	 ize 	 	.
the	relationship	between	child	 mortal 	 ity 	 	and	family	 s 	 ize 	 	.
one	,	two	,	three	,	four	children	per	woman	:
six	,	seven	,	eight	children	per	woman	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	,	once	 aga 	 in 	 	,	1960	--	50	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
each	bubble	is	a	country	--
the	color	,	you	can	see	,	a	continent	.
the	dark	blue	here	is	sub	-	saharan	africa	.
and	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	bubble	is	the	population	.
and	these	are	the	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 develop 	 ing 	 	``	 count 	 ries 	 	.
they	had	high	,	or	 ver 	 y 	 	high	,	child	 mortal 	 ity 	 	and	family	 s 	 ize 	 	,	six	to	eight	.
and	the	 one 	 s 	 	over	there	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	western	 count 	 ries 	 	.
they	had	low	child	 mortal 	 ity 	 	and	small	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	.
what	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	?
what	i	want	you	[	to	do	]	now	is	to	see	with	your	own	 eye 	 s 	 	the	relation	between	fall	in	child	 mortal 	 ity 	 	and	 de 	 crease 	 	in	family	 s 	 ize 	 	.
i	just	want	not	to	have	any	room	for	doubt	--
you	have	to	see	that	for	 your 	 self 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	.	now	i	start	the	world	.
here	we	come	down	with	the	 eradic 	 ation 	 	of	 small 	 pox 	 	,	better	education	,	health	service	.
it	got	down	there	--	 chin 	 a 	 	 come 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	western	box	here	.
and	here	brazil	is	in	the	western	box	.
india	is	 approach 	 ing 	 	.	the	first	african	 count 	 ries 	 	coming	 in 	 to 	 	the	western	box	,
and	we	get	a	lot	a	new	 neighbor 	 s 	 	.
welcome	to	a	 de 	 cent 	 	life	.
come	on	.	we	want	 every 	 one 	 	down	there	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	vision	we	have	,	is	n't	it	.
and	look	now	,	the	first	african	 count 	 ries 	 	here	are	coming	in	.
there	we	are	 to 	 day 	 	.
there	is	no	 s 	 uch 	 	thing	 a 	 s 	 	a	``	western	world	``	and	``	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	report	from	[	the	]	u.n.	,	which	came	out	on	friday	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	good	--	``	 level 	 s 	 	and	 trend 	 s 	 	in	child	 mortal 	 ity 	 	``	--	 ex 	 cept 	 	 th 	 is 	 	page	.
 th 	 is 	 	page	is	 ver 	 y 	 	bad	;
it	's	a	 categor 	 ization 	 	of	 count 	 ries 	 	.
it	 label 	 s 	 	``	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	``	--	i	can	read	from	the	list	here	--	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	:	 re 	 public 	 	of	korea	--	south	korea	.
huh	?
they	get	samsung	,	how	can	they	be	[	a	]	 develop 	 ing 	 	country	?
they	have	here	singapore	.
they	have	the	 low 	 est 	 	child	 mortal 	 ity 	 	in	the	world	,	singapore	.
they	 bypass 	 ed 	 	sweden	five	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	they	are	 label 	 ed 	 	a	 develop 	 ing 	 	country	.
they	have	here	qatar	.
it	's	the	 rich 	 est 	 	country	in	the	world	with	al	jazeera	.
how	the	heck	could	they	be	[	a	]	 develop 	 ing 	 	country	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	crap	.
the	rest	here	is	good	--	the	rest	is	good	.
we	have	to	have	a	modern	 con 	 cept 	 	,	which	 fit 	 s 	 	to	the	data	.
and	we	have	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	we	are	all	going	to	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	down	to	here	.
what	is	the	 import 	 ance 	 	now	with	the	 relation 	 s 	 	here	.
look	--	even	if	we	look	in	africa	--
these	are	the	african	 count 	 ries 	 	.
you	can	 clear 	 ly 	 	see	the	relation	with	 fall 	 ing 	 	child	 mortal 	 ity 	 	and	 decr 	 eas 	 ing 	 	family	 s 	 ize 	 	,	even	 with 	 in 	 	africa	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 happen 	 s 	 	.
and	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	piece	of	research	came	out	on	friday	from	the	institute	of	health	 metric 	 s 	 	and	 evalu 	 ation 	 	in	seattle	 show 	 ing 	 	that	 al 	 most 	 	50	percent	of	the	fall	in	child	 mortal 	 ity 	 	can	be	 attribut 	 ed 	 	to	female	education	.
that	is	,	when	we	get	 girl 	 s 	 	in	school	,	we	'll	get	an	impact	15	to	20	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,
which	is	a	secular	trend	which	is	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	.
that	's	why	we	must	have	that	long	-	term	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	but	we	must	measure	the	impact	over	10	-	year	 period 	 s 	 	.
it	's	fully	possible	to	get	child	 mortal 	 ity 	 	down	in	all	of	these	 count 	 ries 	 	and	to	get	them	down	in	the	corner	where	we	all	would	like	to	live	together	.
and	of	course	,	 lower 	 ing 	 	child	 mortal 	 ity 	 	is	a	matter	of	 ut 	 most 	 	 import 	 ance 	 	from	 human 	 itarian 	 	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	 de 	 cent 	 	life	for	children	,	we	are	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	.
but	it	is	 al 	 so 	 	a	 strat 	 egic 	 	 invest 	 ment 	 	in	the	future	of	all	 man 	 kind 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	about	the	environment	.
we	will	not	be	able	to	manage	the	environment	and	avoid	the	 terr 	 ible 	 	climate	crisis	if	we	do	n't	 stabil 	 ize 	 	the	world	population	.
let	's	be	clear	about	that	.
and	the	way	to	do	that	,	that	is	to	get	child	 mortal 	 ity 	 	down	,	get	access	to	family	 plan 	 ning 	 	and	 be 	 hind 	 	that	drive	female	education	.
and	that	is	fully	possible	.	let	's	do	it	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
