well	,	good	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
you	know	,	the	computer	and	 tele 	 vision 	 	both	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	60	,	and	 to 	 day 	 	i	'd	like	to	talk	about	 the 	 ir 	 	relationship	.
 de 	 spite 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	middle	age	,	if	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	 follow 	 ing 	 	the	 theme 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	or	the	 entertain 	 ment 	 	industry	,	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	clear	that	one	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 pick 	 ing 	 	on	the	other	.
so	it	's	about	time	that	we	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	how	the	computer	ambushed	 tele 	 vision 	 	,
or	why	the	 invent 	 ion 	 	of	the	atomic	bomb	 unleash 	 ed 	 	 force 	 s 	 	that	lead	to	the	 writer 	 s 	 	'	strike	.
and	it	's	not	just	what	these	are	 do 	 ing 	 	to	each	other	,	but	it	's	what	the	audience	 think 	 s 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 frame 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	matter	.
to	get	a	sense	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	theme	we	've	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	all	week	,	i	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	a	bunch	of	tweeners	.
i	wrote	on	 card 	 s 	 	:	``	 tele 	 vision 	 	,	``	``	radio	,	``	``	myspace	,	``	``	 inter 	 net 	 	,	``	``	pc	.	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	just	arrange	these	,	from	what	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	you	and	what	's	not	,	and	then	tell	me	why	.
let	's	listen	to	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	they	get	to	the	 port 	 ion 	 	of	the	 discuss 	 ion 	 	on	 tele 	 vision 	 	.
girl	1	:	well	,	i	think	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	but	,	like	,	not	 necess 	 ary 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	you	can	do	a	lot	of	other	stuff	with	your	free	time	than	watch	 program 	 s 	 	.
peter	hirshberg	:	which	is	more	 f 	 un 	 	,	 inter 	 net 	 	or	tv	?
 girl 	 s 	 	:	 inter 	 net 	 	.
girl	2	:	i	think	we	--	the	 reason 	 s 	 	,	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	we	put	computer	before	tv	is	 be 	 cause 	 	 now 	 a 	 day 	 s 	 	,	like	,	we	have	tv	 show 	 s 	 	on	the	computer	.
girl	2	:	and	then	you	can	download	onto	your	ipod	.
ph	:	would	you	like	to	be	the	 p 	 resident 	 	of	a	tv	network	?
girl	4	:	i	would	n't	like	it	.
girl	2	:	that	would	be	so	 stress 	 ful 	 	.
girl	5	:	no	.
ph	:	how	come	?
girl	5	:	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	going	to	lose	all	 the 	 ir 	 	money	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	.
girl	3	:	like	the	stock	market	,	it	 go 	 es 	 	up	and	down	and	stuff	.
i	think	right	now	the	 computer 	 s 	 	will	be	at	the	top	and	 every 	 thing 	 	will	be	kind	of	going	down	and	stuff	.
ph	:	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	an	 un 	 easy 	 	relationship	between	the	tv	business	and	the	tech	business	,	 re 	 ally 	 	ever	since	they	both	 turn 	 ed 	 	about	30	.
we	go	through	 period 	 s 	 	of	enthrallment	,	 follow 	 ed 	 	by	 react 	 ions 	 	in	 board 	 rooms 	 	,	in	the	finance	community	best	 character 	 ized 	 	 a 	 s 	 	,	what	's	the	finance	term	?	ick	pooey	.
let	me	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	.	the	year	is	1976	,	and	warner	 buy 	 s 	 	atari	 be 	 cause 	 	video	 game 	 s 	 	are	on	the	rise	.
the	next	year	they	march	forward	and	they	 introduc 	 e 	 	qube	,	the	first	 inter 	 active 	 	cable	tv	system	,	and	the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	 herald 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 tele 	 communication 	 s 	 	moving	to	the	home	,	 converg 	 ence 	 	,	great	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
 every 	 body 	 	in	the	east	coast	 get 	 s 	 	in	the	 picture 	 s 	 	--	citicorp	,	penney	,	rca	--	all	 get 	 ting 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	big	vision	.
by	the	way	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	about	when	i	enter	the	picture	.
i	'm	going	to	do	a	summer	 intern 	 ship 	 	at	time	warner	.
that	summer	i	'm	all	--	i	'm	at	warner	that	summer	--	i	'm	all	 excit 	 ed 	 	to	work	on	 converg 	 ence 	 	,	and	then	the	bottom	 fall 	 s 	 	out	.
 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	out	too	well	for	them	,	they	lose	money	.
and	i	had	a	happy	brush	with	 converg 	 ence 	 	 un 	 til 	 	,	kind	of	,	warner	 bas 	 ically 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	liquidate	the	whole	thing	.
that	's	when	i	 leav 	 e 	 	graduate	school	,	and	i	ca	n't	work	in	new	york	on	kind	of	 entertain 	 ment 	 	and	technology	 be 	 cause 	 	i	have	to	be	 ex 	 il 	 ed 	 	to	california	,	where	the	 remain 	 ing 	 	 job 	 s 	 	are	,	 al 	 most 	 	to	the	sea	,	to	go	to	work	for	apple	computer	.
warner	,	of	course	,	 write 	 s 	 	off	more	than	400	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
four	hundred	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	which	was	real	money	back	in	the	'70s	.
but	they	 we 	 re 	 	onto	 some 	 thing 	 	and	they	got	better	at	it	.
by	the	year	2000	,	the	process	was	 perfect 	 ed 	 	.	they	 merge 	 d 	 	with	aol	,	and	in	just	four	 year 	 s 	 	,	 manage 	 d 	 	to	shed	about	200	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	of	market	 capital 	 ization 	 	,	 show 	 ing 	 	that	they	'd	 actual 	 ly 	 	 master 	 ed 	 	the	art	of	 app 	 ly 	 ing 	 	moore	's	law	of	 success 	 ive 	 	 miniatur 	 ization 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	balance	sheet	.
now	,	i	think	that	one	reason	that	the	media	and	the	 entertain 	 ment 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	,	or	the	media	community	,	is	driven	so	crazy	by	the	tech	community	is	that	tech	 folk 	 s 	 	talk	 different 	 ly 	 	.
you	know	,	for	50	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	've	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	changing	the	world	,	about	total	 transform 	 ation 	 	.
for	50	 year 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	about	 hope 	 s 	 	and	 fear 	 s 	 	and	 promise 	 s 	 	of	a	better	world	.	and	i	got	to	 think 	 ing 	 	,	you	know	,	who	else	 talk 	 s 	 	that	way	?
and	the	answer	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	 clear 	 ly 	 	--	it	's	people	in	 relig 	 ion 	 	and	in	 politic 	 s 	 	.
and	so	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	tech	world	is	best	 under 	 stood 	 	,	not	 a 	 s 	 	a	business	cycle	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	a	 mess 	 ian 	 ic 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	.
we	promise	 some 	 thing 	 	great	,	we	 evangel 	 ize 	 	it	,	we	're	going	to	change	the	world	.	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	out	too	well	,	and	so	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	go	back	to	the	well	and	start	all	over	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	people	in	new	york	and	l.a.	look	on	in	absolute	,	morbid	 astonish 	 ment 	 	.
but	it	's	 th 	 is 	 	irrational	view	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 drive 	 s 	 	us	on	to	the	next	thing	.
so	,	what	i	'd	like	to	ask	is	,	if	the	computer	is	 be 	 coming 	 	a	principal	tool	of	media	and	 entertain 	 ment 	 	,	how	did	we	get	here	?
i	mean	,	how	did	a	machine	that	was	built	for	 account 	 ing 	 	and	 art 	 ille 	 ry 	 	morph	 in 	 to 	 	media	?
of	course	,	the	first	computer	was	built	just	after	world	war	ii	to	solve	 militar 	 y 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	,	but	 thing 	 s 	 	got	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	just	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	--	1949	with	 whirl 	 wind 	 	,
built	at	mit	's	lincoln	lab	.	jay	forrester	was	building	 th 	 is 	 	for	the	 nav 	 y 	 	,	but	you	ca	n't	help	but	see	that	the	creator	of	 th 	 is 	 	machine	had	in	mind	a	machine	that	might	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	a	potential	media	star	.
so	take	a	look	at	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	the	 fore 	 most 	 	journalist	of	early	 tele 	 vision 	 	 meet 	 s 	 	one	of	the	 fore 	 most 	 	computer	 pioneer 	 s 	 	,	and	the	computer	 begin 	 s 	 	to	express	 it 	 self 	 	.
journalist	:	it	's	a	 whirl 	 wind 	 	 electron 	 ic 	 	computer	.
with	 consider 	 able 	 	 trepid 	 ation 	 	,	we	 under 	 take 	 	to	interview	 th 	 is 	 	new	machine	.
jay	forrester	:	 hell 	 o 	 	new	york	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	cambridge	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 oscill 	 o 	 scope 	 	of	the	 whirl 	 wind 	 	 electron 	 ic 	 	computer	.
would	you	like	if	i	used	the	machine	?
journalist	:	 y 	 es 	 	,	of	course	.	but	i	have	an	idea	,	mr.	forrester	.
since	 th 	 is 	 	computer	was	made	in	 con 	 junction 	 	with	the	 off 	 ice 	 	of	 nav 	 al 	 	research	,	why	do	n't	we	 s 	 witch 	 	down	to	the	 pent 	 agon 	 	in	washington	and	let	the	 nav 	 y 	 	's	research	chief	,	admiral	bolster	,	give	 whirl 	 wind 	 	the	 work 	 out 	 	?
calvin	bolster	:	well	,	ed	,	 th 	 is 	 	problem	 concern 	 s 	 	the	 nav 	 y 	 	's	viking	rocket	.
 th 	 is 	 	rocket	 go 	 es 	 	up	135	 mile 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	sky	.
now	,	at	the	standard	rate	of	fuel	consumption	,	i	would	like	to	see	the	computer	trace	the	flight	path	of	 th 	 is 	 	rocket	and	see	how	it	can	determine	,	at	any	instant	,	say	at	the	end	of	40	 second 	 s 	 	,	the	amount	of	fuel	 remain 	 ing 	 	,	and	the	 velo 	 city 	 	at	that	set	instant	.
jf	:	over	on	the	left	-	hand	side	,	you	will	notice	fuel	consumption	 decr 	 eas 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	rocket	 take 	 s 	 	off	.
and	on	the	right	-	hand	side	,	there	's	a	scale	that	 show 	 s 	 	the	rocket	's	 velo 	 city 	 	.
the	rocket	's	position	is	 show 	 n 	 	by	the	 tra 	 ject 	 ory 	 	that	we	're	now	looking	at	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	it	 reach 	 es 	 	the	peak	of	 it 	 s 	 	 tra 	 ject 	 ory 	 	,	the	 velo 	 city 	 	,	you	will	notice	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 drop 	 ped 	 	off	to	a	 minim 	 um 	 	.
then	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	rocket	 div 	 es 	 	down	,	 velo 	 city 	 	 pick 	 s 	 	up	 aga 	 in 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	a	 maxim 	 um 	 	 velo 	 city 	 	and	the	rocket	 hit 	 s 	 	the	ground	.
how	's	that	?
journalist	:	what	about	that	,	admiral	?
cb	:	 look 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	good	to	me	.
jf	:	and	before	 leav 	 ing 	 	,	we	would	like	to	show	you	 an 	 other 	 	kind	of	 mathematic 	 al 	 	problem	that	some	of	the	 boy 	 s 	 	have	 work 	 ed 	 	out	in	 the 	 ir 	 	spare	time	,	in	a	less	serious	vein	,	for	a	sunday	afternoon	.
journalist	:	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	mr.	forrester	and	the	mit	lab	.
ph	:	you	know	,	so	much	was	 work 	 ed 	 	out	:	the	first	real	-	time	 interact 	 ion 	 	,	the	video	 dis 	 play 	 	,	 point 	 ing 	 	a	gun	.	it	lead	to	the	 micro 	 computer 	 	,	but	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	it	was	too	 price 	 y 	 	for	the	 nav 	 y 	 	,	and	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	lost	if	it	 we 	 re 	 	n't	for	a	happy	 co 	 incidence 	 	.
enter	the	atomic	bomb	.
we	're	 threaten 	 ed 	 	by	the	 great 	 est 	 	weapon	ever	,	and	 know 	 ing 	 	a	good	thing	when	it	 s 	 ees 	 	it	,	the	air	force	 decide 	 s 	 	it	 need 	 s 	 	the	 big 	 gest 	 	computer	ever	to	protect	us	.
they	adapt	 whirl 	 wind 	 	to	a	massive	air	defense	system	,	deploy	it	all	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 froze 	 n 	 	north	,	and	 s 	 pend 	 	 near 	 ly 	 	three	 time 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	on	 th 	 is 	 	computer	 a 	 s 	 	was	 s 	 pent 	 	on	the	manhattan	project	building	the	a	-	bomb	in	the	first	place	.
talk	about	a	shot	in	the	arm	for	the	computer	industry	.
and	you	can	imagine	that	the	air	force	 be 	 came 	 	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	 sale 	 s 	 man 	 	.
here	's	 the 	 ir 	 	 market 	 ing 	 	video	.
 nar 	 rator 	 	:	in	a	mass	raid	,	high	-	speed	 bomb 	 ers 	 	could	be	in	on	us	before	we	could	determine	 the 	 ir 	 	 track 	 s 	 	.
and	then	it	would	be	too	late	to	act	.
we	can	not	afford	to	take	that	chance	.
it	is	to	meet	 th 	 is 	 	threat	that	the	air	force	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 develop 	 ing 	 	 s 	 age 	 	,	the	semi	-	 autom 	 atic 	 	ground	environment	system	,	to	 strength 	 en 	 	our	air	 defense 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	new	computer	,	built	to	 be 	 come 	 	the	nerve	center	of	a	defense	network	,	is	able	to	perform	all	the	complex	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	countering	a	mass	 ene 	 my 	 	raid	.
it	is	 provide 	 d 	 	with	 it 	 s 	 	own	 power 	 house 	 	 contain 	 ing 	 	large	 dies 	 el 	 	-	driven	 gene 	 rator 	 s 	 	,	air	-	 condition 	 ing 	 	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	,	and	 cool 	 ing 	 	 tower 	 s 	 	 requir 	 ed 	 	to	cool	the	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	vacuum	 tube 	 s 	 	in	the	computer	.
ph	:	you	know	,	that	one	computer	was	huge	.
there	's	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	 market 	 ing 	 	 less 	 on 	 	from	it	,	which	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	when	you	market	a	product	,	you	can	either	say	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	be	 wonder 	 ful 	 	,	it	will	make	you	feel	better	and	enliven	you	.	or	there	's	one	other	 market 	 ing 	 	 pro 	 position 	 	:	if	you	do	n't	use	our	product	,	you	'll	die	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 re 	 ally 	 	good	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	that	.
 th 	 is 	 	had	the	first	 point 	 ing 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	.	it	was	 distribut 	 ed 	 	,	so	it	 work 	 ed 	 	out	--	 distribut 	 ed 	 	computing	and	modems	--	so	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	could	talk	to	each	other	.
about	20	percent	of	all	the	nation	's	 programm 	 ers 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 wrap 	 ped 	 	up	in	 th 	 is 	 	thing	,	and	it	led	to	an	awful	lot	of	what	we	have	 to 	 day 	 	.	it	 al 	 so 	 	used	vacuum	 tube 	 s 	 	.
you	saw	how	huge	it	was	,	and	to	give	you	a	sense	for	 th 	 is 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	we	've	 talk 	 ed 	 	a	lot	about	moore	's	law	and	making	 thing 	 s 	 	small	at	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	,	so	let	's	talk	about	making	 thing 	 s 	 	large	.
if	we	took	 whirl 	 wind 	 	and	put	it	in	a	place	that	you	all	know	,	say	,	century	city	,	it	would	fit	 beaut 	 i 	 fully 	 	.
you	'd	kind	of	have	to	take	century	city	out	,	but	it	could	fit	in	there	.
but	like	,	let	's	imagine	we	took	the	 lat 	 est 	 	pentium	processor	,	the	 lat 	 est 	 	core	2	 extrem 	 e 	 	,	which	is	a	four	-	core	processor	that	 in 	 tel 	 	's	 work 	 ing 	 	on	,	it	will	be	our	 lap 	 top 	 	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	.
to	build	that	,	what	we	'd	do	with	 whirl 	 wind 	 	technology	is	we	'd	have	to	take	up	 rough 	 ly 	 	from	the	10	to	mulholland	,	and	from	the	405	to	la	cienega	just	with	 t 	 hose 	 	whirlwinds	.
and	then	,	the	92	nuclear	power	 plant 	 s 	 	that	it	would	take	to	provide	the	power	would	fill	up	the	rest	of	los	angeles	.
that	's	 rough 	 ly 	 	a	third	more	nuclear	power	than	all	of	france	 create 	 s 	 	.
so	,	the	next	time	they	tell	you	they	're	on	to	 some 	 thing 	 	,	 clear 	 ly 	 	they	're	not	.
so	--	and	we	have	n't	even	 work 	 ed 	 	out	the	 cool 	 ing 	 	 need 	 s 	 	.
but	it	 give 	 s 	 	you	the	kind	of	power	that	people	have	,	that	the	audience	 ha 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 reason 	 s 	 	these	 transform 	 ations 	 	are	 happen 	 ing 	 	.

here	he	is	 talk 	 ing 	 	from	the	1960s	.
marshall	mcluhan	:	if	the	audience	can	 be 	 come 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	the	actual	process	of	making	the	ad	,	then	it	's	happy	.	it	's	like	the	old	quiz	 show 	 s 	 	.	they	 we 	 re 	 	great	tv	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 g 	 ave 	 	the	audience	a	role	,	 some 	 thing 	 	to	do	.

we	're	now	right	 in 	 to 	 	the	1960s	.
it	's	the	era	of	big	business	and	data	 center 	 s 	 	for	computing	.
but	all	that	was	about	to	change	.
you	know	,	the	 express 	 ion 	 	of	technology	 reflect 	 s 	 	the	people	and	the	time	of	the	culture	it	was	built	in	.
and	when	i	say	that	code	 express 	 es 	 	our	 hope 	 s 	 	and	 aspir 	 ations 	 	,	it	's	not	just	a	joke	about	messianism	,	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	what	we	do	.
but	for	 th 	 is 	 	part	of	the	story	,	i	'd	 actual 	 ly 	 	like	to	throw	it	to	america	's	 lead 	 ing 	 	technology	 correspond 	 ent 	 	,	john	markoff	.
john	markoff	:	do	you	want	to	know	what	the	counterculture	in	 drug 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 ex 	 	,	rock	'	n	'	roll	and	the	anti	-	war	 move 	 ment 	 	had	to	do	with	computing	?	 every 	 thing 	 	.
it	all	 happen 	 ed 	 	 with 	 in 	 	five	 mile 	 s 	 	of	where	i	'm	 stand 	 ing 	 	,	at	stanford	university	,	between	1960	and	1975	.
in	the	 mid 	 st 	 	of	revolution	in	the	 street 	 s 	 	and	rock	and	roll	 concert 	 s 	 	in	the	 park 	 s 	 	,	a	group	of	 research 	 ers 	 	led	by	people	like	john	mccarthy	,	a	computer	scientist	at	the	stanford	artificial	 intellig 	 ence 	 	lab	,	and	doug	engelbart	,	a	computer	scientist	at	sri	,	 change 	 d 	 	the	world	.
engelbart	came	out	of	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	dry	 engineer 	 ing 	 	culture	,	but	while	he	was	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	do	his	work	,	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	was	 bubb 	 ling 	 	on	the	mid	-	 pen 	 insula 	 	.

there	was	the	vietnam	war	.	there	was	black	 liber 	 ation 	 	.	there	was	women	's	 liber 	 ation 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	 remark 	 able 	 	place	,	at	a	 remark 	 able 	 	time	.

and	most	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	they	had	 th 	 is 	 	 etho 	 s 	 	of	sharing	information	.
i	think	these	 idea 	 s 	 	are	difficult	to	understand	,	 be 	 cause 	 	when	you	're	trapped	in	one	paradigm	,	the	next	paradigm	is	 al 	 ways 	 	like	a	science	fiction	 uni 	 verse 	 	--	it	 make 	 s 	 	no	sense	.
the	 st 	 ories 	 	 we 	 re 	 	so	 compel 	 ling 	 	that	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	write	a	book	about	them	.
the	title	of	the	book	is	,	``	what	the	dormouse	 s 	 aid 	 	:	how	the	'60s	counterculture	shaped	the	personal	computer	industry	.	``

here	's	the	 architect 	 ure 	 	machine	group	,	the	 pre 	 decessor 	 	of	the	media	lab	,	in	1981	.

hypercard	was	the	first	program	to	 introduc 	 e 	 	the	public	to	hyperlinks	,	where	you	could	 random 	 ly 	 	hook	to	any	kind	of	picture	,	or	piece	of	text	,	or	data	 a 	 cross 	 	a	file	system	,	and	we	had	no	way	of	 explain 	 ing 	 	it	.
there	was	no	metaphor	.	was	it	a	 data 	 base 	 	?
a	 proto 	 ty 	 ping 	 	tool	?	a	 script 	 ed 	 	language	?
heck	,	it	was	 every 	 thing 	 	.	so	we	 end 	 ed 	 	up	writing	a	 market 	 ing 	 	brochure	.

james	burke	:	you	'll	be	 pleas 	 ed 	 	to	know	,	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	,	that	there	are	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	ways	to	create	a	hypercard	 inter 	 active 	 	video	.
the	most	 involve 	 d 	 	method	is	to	go	 a 	 head 	 	and	produce	your	own	videodisc	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	build	your	own	hypercard	 stack 	 s 	 	.
by	far	the	 simpl 	 est 	 	method	is	to	buy	a	pre	-	made	videodisc	and	hypercard	 stack 	 s 	 	from	a	commercial	 suppli 	 er 	 	.
the	method	we	 illustr 	 ate 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	video	uses	a	pre	-	made	videodisc	but	 create 	 s 	 	custom	hypercard	 stack 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	method	 allow 	 s 	 	you	to	use	 exist 	 ing 	 	videodisc	 material 	 s 	 	in	ways	which	suit	your	specific	 need 	 s 	 	and	 interest 	 s 	 	.
ph	:	i	hope	you	 real 	 ize 	 	how	 sub 	 ver 	 s 	 ive 	 	that	is	.
that	's	like	a	 d 	 ick 	 	cheney	speech	.
you	think	he	's	a	nice	 bald 	 ing 	 	guy	,	but	he	's	just	 declare 	 d 	 	war	on	the	content	business	.	find	the	commercial	stuff	,	mash	it	up	,	tell	the	story	your	way	.

by	the	way	,	 s 	 peaking 	 	of	the	filing	system	,	it	never	 occur 	 red 	 	to	us	that	these	hyperlinks	could	go	beyond	the	local	area	network	.

mm	:	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 g 	 ave 	 	the	audience	a	role	,	 some 	 thing 	 	to	do	.
ph	:	in	my	own	company	,	technorati	,	we	see	 some 	 thing 	 	like	67,000	blog	 post 	 s 	 	an	hour	come	in	.
that	's	about	2,700	fresh	,	 connect 	 ive 	 	 link 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	about	112	million	 blog 	 s 	 	that	are	out	there	.
and	it	's	no	wonder	that	 a 	 s 	 	we	head	 in 	 to 	 	the	 writer 	 s 	 	'	strike	,	odd	 thing 	 s 	 	happen	.
you	know	,	it	 re 	 mind 	 s 	 	me	of	that	old	saw	in	hollywood	,	that	a	 produce 	 r 	 	is	 any 	 one 	 	who	 know 	 s 	 	a	writer	.
i	now	think	a	network	 bo 	 s 	 s 	 	is	 any 	 one 	 	who	 ha 	 s 	 	a	cable	 mod 	 em 	 	.
but	it	's	not	a	joke	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	real	 head 	 line 	 	.	``	 web 	 s 	 ites 	 	attract	 s 	 tri 	 king 	 	 writer 	 s 	 	:
 oper 	 ators 	 	of	 s 	 ites 	 	like	mydamnchannel.com	could	benefit	from	labor	 disput 	 es 	 	.	``
 mean 	 while 	 	,	you	have	the	tv	 blogger 	 s 	 	going	out	on	strike	,	in	 sympath 	 y 	 	with	the	 tele 	 vision 	 	 writer 	 s 	 	.
and	then	you	have	tv	guide	,	a	fox	 proper 	 ty 	 	,	which	is	about	to	sponsor	the	 on 	 line 	 	video	 a 	 ward 	 s 	 	--	but	cancels	it	out	of	 sympath 	 y 	 	with	 tradition 	 al 	 	 tele 	 vision 	 	,	not	 appear 	 ing 	 	to	gloat	.
to	show	you	how	schizophrenic	 th 	 is 	 	all	is	,	here	's	the	head	of	myspace	,	or	fox	 inter 	 active 	 	,	a	news	corp	company	,	 be 	 ing 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	well	,	with	the	 writer 	 s 	 	'	strike	,	is	n't	 th 	 is 	 	going	to	hurt	news	corp	and	help	you	 on 	 line 	 	?
man	:	but	i	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	i	think	there	's	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.	 a 	 s 	 	the	strike	 continu 	 es 	 	,	there	's	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	for	more	people	to	experience	video	on	 place 	 s 	 	like	myspace	tv	.
ph	:	oh	,	but	then	he	 remember 	 s 	 	he	 work 	 s 	 	for	rupert	murdoch	.
man	:	 y 	 es 	 	,	well	,	first	,	you	know	,	i	'm	part	of	news	corporation	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	fox	 entertain 	 ment 	 	group	.	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	we	hope	that	the	strike	is	--	that	the	 issue 	 s 	 	are	resolved	 a 	 s 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	possible	.
ph	:	one	of	the	great	 thing 	 s 	 	that	's	going	on	here	is	the	 global 	 ization 	 	of	content	 re 	 ally 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
here	is	a	clip	from	a	video	,	from	a	piece	of	 anim 	 ation 	 	that	was	written	by	a	writer	in	hollywood	,	 anim 	 ation 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	out	in	israel	,	 farm 	 ed 	 	out	to	croatia	and	india	,	and	it	's	now	an	 inter 	 national 	 	 s 	 eries 	 	.
 nar 	 rator 	 	:	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	 take 	 s 	 	place	between	the	 minute 	 s 	 	of	2:15	 p.m 	 . 	 	and	2:18	 p.m 	 . 	 	,
in	the	 month 	 s 	 	 p 	 reced 	 ing 	 	the	 p 	 resident 	 ial 	 	 prim 	 aries 	 	.
voice	1	:	you	'll	have	to	stay	here	in	the	safe	house	 un 	 til 	 	we	get	word	the	terrorist	threat	is	over	.
voice	2	:	you	mean	we	'll	have	to	live	here	,	together	?
voice	2	:	well	,	there	 go 	 es 	 	the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	.
ph	:	the	company	that	 create 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	aniboom	,	is	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	where	 th 	 is 	 	is	headed	.	 tradition 	 al 	 	tv	 anim 	 ation 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	,	say	,	between	80,000	and	10,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	minute	.
they	're	producing	 thing 	 s 	 	for	between	1,500	and	800	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	minute	.
and	they	're	 off 	 er 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 creator 	 s 	 	30	percent	of	the	back	end	,	in	a	much	more	 entrepreneur 	 ial 	 	manner	.	so	,	it	's	a	different	model	.
what	the	 entertain 	 ment 	 	business	is	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	with	,	the	world	of	 brand 	 s 	 	is	 figur 	 ing 	 	out	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	nike	now	 understand 	 s 	 	that	nike	plus	is	not	just	a	 de 	 vice 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	shoe	,	it	's	a	network	to	hook	 it 	 s 	 	 custom 	 ers 	 	together	.
and	the	head	of	 market 	 ing 	 	at	nike	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	people	are	coming	to	our	 s 	 ite 	 	an	average	of	three	 time 	 s 	 	a	week	.	we	do	n't	have	to	go	to	them	.	``	which	 mean 	 s 	 	 tele 	 vision 	 	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	is	down	57	percent	for	nike	.
or	,	 a 	 s 	 	nike	's	head	of	 market 	 ing 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	we	're	not	in	the	business	of	 keep 	 ing 	 	media	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	 al 	 ive 	 	.
we	're	in	the	business	of	 connect 	 ing 	 	with	 consumer 	 s 	 	.	``
and	media	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	 real 	 ize 	 	the	audience	is	 import 	 ant 	 	 al 	 so 	 	.
here	's	a	man	 announc 	 ing 	 	the	new	market	watch	from	dow	jones	,	powered	100	percent	by	the	user	experience	on	the	home	page	--	user	-	generated	content	married	up	with	 tradition 	 al 	 	content	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	you	have	a	 big 	 ger 	 	audience	and	more	interest	if	you	hook	up	with	them	.
or	,	 a 	 s 	 	geoffrey	moore	once	told	me	,	it	's	intellectual	curiosity	that	's	the	trade	that	 brand 	 s 	 	need	in	the	age	of	the	 blog 	 o 	 sphere 	 	.
and	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	happen	in	the	 entertain 	 ment 	 	business	.
one	of	my	heroes	is	songwriter	,	ally	willis	,	who	just	wrote	``	the	color	 pur 	 ple 	 	``	and	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	an	r	and	--	rhythm	and	 blue 	 s 	 	writer	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	she	 s 	 aid 	 	about	where	 song 	 writing 	 	's	going	.
ally	willis	:	where	 million 	 s 	 	of	 collabor 	 ators 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	the	song	,	 be 	 cause 	 	to	look	at	them	 strict 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	spam	is	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	what	 th 	 is 	 	medium	is	about	.
ph	:	so	,	to	wrap	up	,	i	'd	love	to	throw	it	back	to	marshall	mcluhan	,	who	,	40	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	was	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	 audience 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	going	through	just	 a 	 s 	 	much	change	,	and	i	think	that	,	 to 	 day 	 	,	 tradition 	 al 	 	hollywood	and	the	 writer 	 s 	 	are	framing	 th 	 is 	 	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	in	the	way	that	it	was	 be 	 ing 	 	 frame 	 d 	 	before	.
but	i	do	n't	need	to	tell	you	 th 	 is 	 	,	let	's	throw	it	back	to	him	.
 nar 	 rator 	 	:	we	are	in	the	middle	of	a	tremendous	 c 	 lash 	 	between	the	old	and	the	new	.
mm	:	the	medium	 do 	 es 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	to	people	and	they	are	 al 	 ways 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	 un 	 aware 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
they	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	notice	the	new	medium	that	is	 wrap 	 ping 	 	them	up	.
they	think	of	the	old	medium	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	old	medium	is	 al 	 ways 	 	the	content	of	the	new	medium	,	 a 	 s 	 	 movie 	 s 	 	tend	to	be	the	content	of	tv	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	 book 	 s 	 	used	to	be	the	content	,	 novel 	 s 	 	used	to	be	the	content	of	 movie 	 s 	 	.
and	so	every	time	a	new	medium	 arriv 	 es 	 	,	the	old	medium	is	the	content	,	and	it	is	 high 	 ly 	 	 observ 	 able 	 	,	 high 	 ly 	 	 notice 	 able 	 	,	but	the	real	,	real	roughing	up	and	massaging	is	 d 	 one 	 	by	the	new	medium	,	and	it	is	 ignor 	 ed 	 	.
ph	:	i	think	it	's	a	great	time	of	enthrallment	.
there	's	 be 	 en 	 	more	raw	dna	of	 communication 	 s 	 	and	media	 throw 	 n 	 	out	there	.	content	is	moving	from	 show 	 s 	 	to	 particle 	 s 	 	that	are	 batt 	 ed 	 	back	and	forth	,	and	part	of	social	 communication 	 s 	 	,	and	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	be	a	time	of	great	 ren 	 aiss 	 ance 	 	and	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
and	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	 tele 	 vision 	 	may	have	gotten	beat	up	,	what	's	 get 	 ting 	 	built	is	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	new	form	of	communication	,	and	we	kind	of	have	the	 merge 	 r 	 	of	the	two	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	and	a	new	way	of	 think 	 ing 	 	to	look	at	it	.
 thank 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
