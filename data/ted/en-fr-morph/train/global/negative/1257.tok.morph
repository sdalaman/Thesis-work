i	am	a	 papercut 	 ter 	 	.	i	cut	 st 	 ories 	 	.
so	my	process	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 straight 	 forward 	 	.
i	take	a	piece	of	paper	,	i	 visual 	 ize 	 	my	story	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	i	sketch	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	i	do	n't	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	my	image	is	 al 	 ready 	 	 in 	 side 	 	the	paper	,	i	just	have	to	 re 	 move 	 	what	's	not	from	that	story	.
so	i	did	n't	come	to	 papercut 	 ting 	 	in	a	straight	line	.
in	fact	,	i	see	it	more	 a 	 s 	 	a	spiral	.
i	was	not	born	with	a	blade	in	my	hand	.
and	i	do	n't	remember	 papercut 	 ting 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	child	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	teenager	,	i	was	 sketch 	 ing 	 	,	 draw 	 ing 	 	,	and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	an	artist	.
but	i	was	 al 	 so 	 	a	rebel	.
and	i	left	 every 	 thing 	 	and	went	for	a	long	 s 	 eries 	 	of	odd	 job 	 s 	 	.
so	among	them	,	i	have	 be 	 en 	 	a	 shepherd 	 es 	 s 	 	,	a	truck	driver	,	a	 factor 	 y 	 	 work 	 er 	 	,	a	 clean 	 ing 	 	 lad 	 y 	 	.
i	 work 	 ed 	 	in	 tour 	 ism 	 	for	one	year	in	mexico	,	one	year	in	egypt	.
i	 move 	 d 	 	for	two	 year 	 s 	 	in	taiwan	.
and	then	i	 settl 	 ed 	 	in	new	york	where	i	 be 	 came 	 	a	tour	guide	.
and	i	still	 work 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	tour	 lead 	 er 	 	,	 travel 	 ed 	 	back	and	forth	in	 chin 	 a 	 	,	tibet	and	central	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	.
so	of	course	,	it	took	time	,	and	i	was	 near 	 ly 	 	40	,	and	i	 decide 	 d 	 	it	's	time	to	start	 a 	 s 	 	an	artist	.
i	chose	 papercut 	 ting 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	paper	is	cheap	,	it	's	light	,	and	you	can	use	it	in	a	lot	of	different	ways	.
and	i	chose	the	language	of	 s 	 il 	 houette 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 graphical 	 ly 	 	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	efficient	.
and	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	just	 get 	 ting 	 	to	the	essential	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
so	the	word	``	 s 	 il 	 houette 	 	``	 come 	 s 	 	from	a	 mini 	 ster 	 	of	finance	,	etienne	de	 s 	 il 	 houette 	 	.
and	he	 s 	 lash 	 ed 	 	so	 man 	 y 	 	 budget 	 s 	 	that	people	 s 	 aid 	 	they	could	n't	afford	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	 any 	 more 	 	,	and	they	 need 	 ed 	 	to	have	 the 	 ir 	 	portrait	``	a	la	 s 	 il 	 houette 	 	.	``
so	i	made	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 image 	 s 	 	,	 cutting 	 s 	 	,	and	i	 assemble 	 d 	 	them	in	 portfolio 	 s 	 	.
and	people	told	me	--	like	these	36	 view 	 s 	 	of	the	empire	state	building	--	they	told	me	,	``	you	're	making	artist	 book 	 s 	 	.	``
so	artist	 book 	 s 	 	have	a	lot	of	 definition 	 s 	 	.
they	come	in	a	lot	of	different	 shape 	 s 	 	.
but	to	me	,	they	are	 fasci 	 nating 	 	 object 	 s 	 	to	 visual 	 ly 	 	narrate	a	story	.
they	can	be	with	 word 	 s 	 	or	 with 	 out 	 	 word 	 s 	 	.
and	i	have	a	 pass 	 ion 	 	for	 image 	 s 	 	and	for	 word 	 s 	 	.
i	love	pun	and	the	relation	to	the	 un 	 conscious 	 	.
i	love	 odd 	 ities 	 	of	 language 	 s 	 	.
and	 every 	 where 	 	i	lived	,	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	the	 language 	 s 	 	,	but	never	 master 	 ed 	 	them	.
so	i	'm	 al 	 ways 	 	looking	for	the	false	 co 	 gn 	 ates 	 	or	 ident 	 ical 	 	 word 	 s 	 	in	different	 language 	 s 	 	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	guess	,	my	mother	tongue	is	french	.
and	my	 dai 	 ly 	 	language	is	english	.
so	i	did	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	work	where	it	was	 ident 	 ical 	 	 word 	 s 	 	in	french	and	in	english	.
so	one	of	these	 work 	 s 	 	is	the	``	 spell 	 ing 	 	spider	.	``
so	the	 spell 	 ing 	 	spider	is	a	cousin	of	the	 spell 	 ing 	 	bee	.
but	it	's	much	more	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	the	web	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	spider	 spin 	 s 	 	a	 bi 	 lingual 	 	 alpha 	 bet 	 	.
so	you	can	read	``	 architect 	 ure 	 	active	``	or	``	active	 architect 	 ure 	 	.	``
so	 th 	 is 	 	spider	 go 	 es 	 	through	the	whole	 alpha 	 bet 	 	with	 ident 	 ical 	 	 adjective 	 s 	 	and	 substantive 	 s 	 	.
so	if	you	do	n't	know	one	of	these	 language 	 s 	 	,	it	's	instant	 learn 	 ing 	 	.
and	one	ancient	form	of	the	book	is	 scroll 	 s 	 	.
so	 scroll 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	convenient	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	can	create	a	large	image	on	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	table	.
so	the	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	of	that	is	that	you	 on 	 ly 	 	see	one	part	of	your	image	,	so	it	 make 	 s 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 free 	 style 	 	 architect 	 ure 	 	.
and	i	'm	making	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 window 	 s 	 	.
so	it	's	to	look	beyond	the	surface	.
it	's	to	have	a	look	at	different	 world 	 s 	 	.
and	 ver 	 y 	 	often	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	an	 out 	 sider 	 	.
so	i	want	to	see	how	 thing 	 s 	 	work	and	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
so	each	window	is	an	image	and	is	a	world	that	i	often	 re 	 visit 	 	.
and	i	 re 	 visit 	 	 th 	 is 	 	world	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	image	or	clich√©	about	what	we	want	to	do	,	and	what	are	the	 word 	 s 	 	,	 coll 	 oquial 	 ism 	 s 	 	,	that	we	have	with	the	 express 	 ions 	 	.
it	's	all	if	.
so	what	if	we	 we 	 re 	 	living	in	balloon	 house 	 s 	 	?
it	would	make	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 up 	 lift 	 ing 	 	world	.
and	we	would	 leav 	 e 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	low	 foot 	 print 	 	on	the	planet	.
it	would	be	so	light	.
so	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	i	view	from	the	 in 	 side 	 	,	like	egocentricity	and	the	inner	 circle 	 s 	 	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	it	's	a	global	view	,	to	see	our	common	 root 	 s 	 	and	how	we	can	use	them	to	catch	 dream 	 s 	 	.
and	we	can	use	them	 al 	 so 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 safe 	 ty 	 	net	.
and	my	 inspiration 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 eclec 	 tic 	 	.
i	'm	 influence 	 d 	 	by	 every 	 thing 	 	i	read	,	 every 	 thing 	 	i	see	.
i	have	some	 st 	 ories 	 	that	are	 humor 	 ous 	 	,	like	``	dead	 beat 	 s 	 	.	``
other	 one 	 s 	 	are	 historic 	 al 	 	.
here	it	's	``	candycity	.	``
it	's	a	non	-	sugar	-	 co 	 ated 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	sugar	.
it	 go 	 es 	 	from	slave	trade	to	over	-	consumption	of	sugar	with	some	sweet	 moment 	 s 	 	in	between	.
and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	i	have	an	 emotion 	 al 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	to	news	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	2010	haitian	 earth 	 quake 	 	.
other	 time 	 s 	 	,	it	's	not	even	my	 st 	 ories 	 	.
people	tell	me	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 memor 	 ies 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 aspir 	 ations 	 	,	and	i	create	a	 mind 	 s 	 cape 	 	.
i	channel	 the 	 ir 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	[	so	that	]	they	have	a	place	to	go	back	to	look	at	 the 	 ir 	 	life	and	 it 	 s 	 	 possibil 	 ities 	 	.
i	call	them	freudian	cities	.
i	can	not	speak	for	all	my	 image 	 s 	 	,	so	i	'll	just	go	through	a	few	of	my	 world 	 s 	 	just	with	the	title	.
``	modicity	.	``	``	 electric 	 ity 	 	.	``	``	mad	growth	on	columbus	circle	.	``	``	reefcity	.	``	``	a	web	of	time	.	``	``	 cha 	 os 	 	city	.	``	``	 dai 	 ly 	 	 battle 	 s 	 	.	``	``	felicity	.	``	``	 float 	 ing 	 	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	.	``
and	at	one	point	,	i	had	to	do	``	the	whole	nine	 yard 	 s 	 	.	``
so	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	papercut	that	's	nine	 yard 	 s 	 	long	.
so	in	life	and	in	 papercut 	 ting 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	is	 connect 	 ed 	 	.
one	story	 lead 	 s 	 	to	 an 	 other 	 	.
i	was	 al 	 so 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	 physical 	 ity 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	format	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	have	to	walk	to	see	it	.
and	parallel	to	my	cutting	is	my	running	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	with	small	 image 	 s 	 	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	with	a	few	 mile 	 s 	 	.
 large 	 r 	 	 image 	 s 	 	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	run	 marathon 	 s 	 	.
then	i	went	to	run	50k	,	then	60k	.
then	i	ran	50	 mile 	 s 	 	--	 ultra 	 marathon 	 s 	 	.
and	i	still	feel	i	'm	running	,	it	's	just	the	training	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	long	-	distance	 papercut 	 ter 	 	.
and	running	 give 	 s 	 	me	a	lot	of	energy	.
here	is	a	three	-	week	 papercut 	 ting 	 	marathon	at	the	museum	of	 art 	 s 	 	and	design	in	new	york	city	.
the	result	is	``	 hell 	 s 	 	and	 heaven 	 s 	 	.	``
it	's	two	 pan 	 el 	 s 	 	13	ft.	high	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 install 	 ed 	 	in	the	museum	on	two	 floor 	 s 	 	,	but	in	fact	,	it	's	a	 continu 	 ous 	 	image	.
and	i	call	it	``	 hell 	 s 	 	and	 heaven 	 s 	 	``	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 dai 	 ly 	 	 hell 	 s 	 	and	 dai 	 ly 	 	 heaven 	 s 	 	.
there	is	no	border	in	between	.
some	people	are	born	in	 hell 	 s 	 	,	and	against	all	 odd 	 s 	 	,	they	make	it	to	 heaven 	 s 	 	.
other	people	make	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	trip	.
that	's	the	border	.
you	have	 sweat 	 shop 	 s 	 	in	 hell 	 s 	 	.
you	have	people	 rent 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 wing 	 s 	 	in	the	 heaven 	 s 	 	.
and	then	you	have	all	 t 	 hose 	 	individual	 st 	 ories 	 	where	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	we	even	have	the	same	action	,	and	the	result	 put 	 s 	 	you	in	 hell 	 s 	 	or	in	 heaven 	 s 	 	.
so	the	whole	``	 hell 	 s 	 	and	 heaven 	 s 	 	``	is	about	free	will	and	 determi 	 n 	 ism 	 	.
and	in	 papercut 	 ting 	 	,	you	have	the	 draw 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	structure	 it 	 self 	 	.
so	you	can	take	it	off	the	wall	.
here	it	's	an	artist	book	 install 	 ation 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 ident 	 ity 	 	project	.	``
it	's	not	 auto 	 bio 	 graphical 	 	 ident 	 ities 	 	.
they	are	more	our	social	 ident 	 ities 	 	.
and	then	you	can	just	walk	 be 	 hind 	 	them	and	try	them	on	.
so	it	's	like	the	different	 layer 	 s 	 	of	what	we	are	made	of	and	what	we	present	to	the	world	 a 	 s 	 	an	 ident 	 ity 	 	.
that	's	 an 	 other 	 	artist	book	project	.
in	fact	,	in	the	picture	,	you	have	two	of	them	.
it	's	one	i	'm	 wear 	 ing 	 	and	one	that	's	on	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	at	the	center	for	 book 	 s 	 	 art 	 s 	 	in	new	york	city	.
why	do	i	call	it	a	book	?
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	fashion	 state 	 ment 	 	,	``	and	there	are	 quote 	 s 	 	about	fashion	,	so	you	can	read	it	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	definition	of	artist	book	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 gen 	 er 	 ous 	 	.
so	artist	 book 	 s 	 	,	you	take	them	off	the	wall	.
you	take	them	for	a	walk	.
you	can	 al 	 so 	 	install	them	 a 	 s 	 	public	art	.
here	it	's	in	scottsdale	,	arizona	,	and	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 float 	 ing 	 	 memor 	 ies 	 	.	``
so	it	's	 region 	 al 	 	 memor 	 ies 	 	,	and	they	are	just	 random 	 ly 	 	 move 	 d 	 	by	the	wind	.
i	love	public	art	.
and	i	 enter 	 ed 	 	 com 	 petition 	 s 	 	for	a	long	time	.
after	eight	 year 	 s 	 	of	 reject 	 ion 	 	,	i	was	 thrill 	 ed 	 	to	get	my	first	commission	with	the	percent	for	art	in	new	york	city	.
it	was	for	a	 merge 	 r 	 	station	for	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	 work 	 ers 	 	and	 fire 	 men 	 	.
i	made	an	artist	book	that	's	in	 stain 	 less 	 	steel	 in 	 stead 	 	of	paper	.
i	 call 	 ed 	 	it	``	 work 	 ing 	 	in	the	same	direction	.	``
but	i	 add 	 ed 	 	 weather 	 van 	 es 	 	on	both	 side 	 s 	 	to	show	that	they	cover	all	 direction 	 s 	 	.
with	public	art	,	i	could	 al 	 so 	 	make	cut	glass	.
here	it	's	 facet 	 ed 	 	glass	in	the	bronx	.
and	each	time	i	make	public	art	,	i	want	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	relevant	to	the	place	it	's	 install 	 ed 	 	.
so	for	the	 sub 	 way 	 	in	new	york	,	i	saw	a	 correspond 	 ence 	 	between	 rid 	 ing 	 	the	 sub 	 way 	 	and	 read 	 ing 	 	.
it	is	travel	in	time	,	travel	on	time	.
and	bronx	 liter 	 ature 	 	,	it	's	all	about	bronx	 writer 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	glass	project	is	in	a	public	library	in	san	jose	,	california	.
so	i	made	a	 veget 	 able 	 	point	of	view	of	the	growth	of	san	jose	.
so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	in	the	center	with	the	 a 	 corn 	 	for	the	ohlone	indian	 civil 	 ization 	 	.
then	i	have	the	fruit	from	europe	for	the	 ranch 	 ers 	 	.
and	then	the	fruit	of	the	world	for	silicon	 val 	 ley 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	it	's	still	growing	.
so	the	 techni 	 que 	 	,	it	's	cut	,	 sand 	 blast 	 ed 	 	,	 etch 	 ed 	 	and	 print 	 ed 	 	glass	 in 	 to 	 	 architect 	 ural 	 	glass	.
and	 out 	 side 	 	the	library	,	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	make	a	place	to	 cultiv 	 ate 	 	your	mind	.
i	took	library	material	that	had	fruit	in	 the 	 ir 	 	title	and	i	used	them	to	make	an	 orc 	 hard 	 	walk	with	these	 fruit 	 s 	 	of	knowledge	.
i	 al 	 so 	 	 plant 	 ed 	 	the	 biblio 	 tree 	 	.
so	it	's	a	tree	,	and	in	 it 	 s 	 	trunk	you	have	the	 root 	 s 	 	of	 language 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	all	about	 inter 	 national 	 	writing	 system 	 s 	 	.
and	on	the	 branch 	 es 	 	you	have	library	material	growing	.
you	can	 al 	 so 	 	have	function	and	form	with	public	art	.
so	in	aurora	,	colorado	it	's	a	bench	.
but	you	have	a	 bon 	 us 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	bench	.
 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	 s 	 it 	 	a	long	time	in	summer	in	 short 	 s 	 	,	you	will	walk	away	with	 tempor 	 ary 	 	 brand 	 ing 	 	of	the	story	element	on	your	 t 	 high 	 s 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	functional	work	,	it	's	in	the	south	side	of	chicago	for	a	 sub 	 way 	 	station	.
and	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 seed 	 s 	 	of	the	future	are	 plant 	 ed 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.	``
it	's	a	story	about	 transform 	 ation 	 	and	 connect 	 ions 	 	.
so	it	 act 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	screen	to	protect	the	rail	and	the	 commute 	 r 	 	,	and	not	to	have	 object 	 s 	 	 fall 	 ing 	 	on	the	 rail 	 s 	 	.
to	be	able	to	change	 f 	 ence 	 s 	 	and	window	 guard 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 flower 	 s 	 	,	it	's	fantastic	.
and	here	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	for	the	last	three	 year 	 s 	 	with	a	south	bronx	 develop 	 er 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	art	to	life	to	low	-	income	 building 	 s 	 	and	 afford 	 able 	 	housing	.
so	each	building	 ha 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	own	 personal 	 ity 	 	.
and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	it	's	about	a	 leg 	 acy 	 	of	the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	,	like	in	morrisania	,	about	the	jazz	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
and	for	other	 project 	 s 	 	,	like	in	paris	,	it	's	about	the	name	of	the	street	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	 ru 	 e 	 	 de 	 s 	 	 prairie 	 s 	 	--	prairie	street	.
so	i	 br 	 ought 	 	back	the	 rabbi 	 t 	 	,	the	 dragon 	 fly 	 	,	to	stay	in	that	street	.
and	in	2009	,	i	was	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	make	a	 post 	 er 	 	to	be	 place 	 d 	 	in	the	 sub 	 way 	 	 car 	 s 	 	in	new	york	city	for	a	year	.
so	that	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 captiv 	 e 	 	audience	.
and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	give	them	an	 es 	 cape 	 	.
i	 create 	 d 	 	``	all	around	town	.	``
it	is	a	 papercut 	 ting 	 	,	and	then	after	,	i	 add 	 ed 	 	color	on	the	computer	.
so	i	can	call	it	techno	-	 craft 	 ed 	 	.
and	 a 	 long 	 	the	way	,	i	'm	kind	of	making	 papercut 	 ting 	 s 	 	and	 add 	 ing 	 	other	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	.
but	the	result	is	 al 	 ways 	 	to	have	 st 	 ories 	 	.
so	the	 st 	 ories 	 	,	they	have	a	lot	of	 possibil 	 ities 	 	.
they	have	a	lot	of	 scenario 	 s 	 	.
i	do	n't	know	the	 st 	 ories 	 	.
i	take	 image 	 s 	 	from	our	global	 imagin 	 ation 	 	,	from	clich√©	,	from	 thing 	 s 	 	we	are	 think 	 ing 	 	about	,	from	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
and	 every 	 body 	 	's	a	 nar 	 rator 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 every 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	story	to	tell	.
but	more	 import 	 ant 	 	is	 every 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	make	a	story	to	make	sense	of	the	world	.
and	in	all	these	 uni 	 verse 	 s 	 	,	it	's	like	 imagin 	 ation 	 	is	the	vehicle	to	be	 transport 	 ed 	 	with	,	but	the	destination	is	our	 mind 	 s 	 	and	how	we	can	 re 	 connect 	 	with	the	essential	and	with	the	magic	.
and	it	's	what	story	cutting	is	all	about	.
