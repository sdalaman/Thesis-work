when	i	was	a	child	,	i	 al 	 ways 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	a	 super 	 hero 	 	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 s 	 ave 	 	the	world	and	then	make	 every 	 one 	 	happy	.
but	i	 k 	 new 	 	that	i	'd	need	 super 	 power 	 s 	 	to	make	my	 dream 	 s 	 	come	true	.
so	i	used	to	embark	on	these	 imagin 	 ary 	 	 journey 	 s 	 	to	find	 inter 	 galactic 	 	 object 	 s 	 	from	planet	krypton	,	which	was	a	lot	of	 f 	 un 	 	,	but	did	n't	get	much	result	.
when	i	grew	up	and	 real 	 ized 	 	that	science	fiction	was	not	a	good	source	for	 super 	 power 	 s 	 	,	i	 decide 	 d 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	to	embark	on	a	journey	of	real	science	,	to	find	a	more	 use 	 ful 	 	truth	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	my	journey	in	california	with	a	uc	berkley	30	-	year	 long 	 itudinal 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	that	 examine 	 d 	 	the	 photo 	 s 	 	of	 student 	 s 	 	in	an	old	 year 	 book 	 	and	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	measure	 the 	 ir 	 	success	and	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	 through 	 out 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	life	.
by	 measur 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	student	 s 	 mile 	 s 	 	,	 research 	 ers 	 	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	predict	how	 fulfill 	 ing 	 	and	long	-	 last 	 ing 	 	a	subject	's	marriage	will	be	,	how	well	she	would	score	on	 standard 	 ized 	 	 test 	 s 	 	of	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	and	how	inspiring	she	would	be	to	 other 	 s 	 	.
in	 an 	 other 	 	 year 	 book 	 	,	i	 s 	 tumble 	 d 	 	 up 	 on 	 	barry	obama	's	picture	.
when	i	first	saw	his	picture	,	i	thought	that	these	 super 	 power 	 s 	 	came	from	his	super	collar	.
but	now	i	know	it	was	all	in	his	 s 	 mile 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	aha	!	moment	came	from	a	2010	wayne	state	university	research	project	that	 look 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	pre	-	1950s	 base 	 ball 	 	 card 	 s 	 	of	major	league	 player 	 s 	 	.
the	 research 	 ers 	 	found	that	the	span	of	a	player	's	 s 	 mile 	 	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	predict	the	span	of	his	life	.
 player 	 s 	 	who	did	n't	 s 	 mile 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	lived	an	average	of	 on 	 ly 	 	72.9	 year 	 s 	 	,	where	 player 	 s 	 	with	 beam 	 ing 	 	 s 	 mile 	 s 	 	lived	an	average	of	 al 	 most 	 	80	 year 	 s 	 	.
the	good	news	is	that	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	born	 smil 	 ing 	 	.
using	3d	 ultra 	 sound 	 	technology	,	we	can	now	see	that	 develop 	 ing 	 	 bab 	 ies 	 	appear	to	 s 	 mile 	 	,	even	in	the	womb	.
when	they	're	born	,	 bab 	 ies 	 	 continu 	 e 	 	to	 s 	 mile 	 	--	 initi 	 ally 	 	,	 most 	 ly 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	sleep	.
and	even	blind	 bab 	 ies 	 	 s 	 mile 	 	to	the	sound	of	the	human	voice	.
 smil 	 ing 	 	is	one	of	the	most	 bas 	 ic 	 	,	 bio 	 logically 	 	-	uniform	 express 	 ions 	 	of	all	 human 	 s 	 	.
in	 stud 	 ies 	 	 conduct 	 ed 	 	in	papua	new	guinea	,	paul	ekman	,	the	world	's	most	 ren 	 owned 	 	 research 	 er 	 	on	 fa 	 cial 	 	 express 	 ions 	 	,	found	that	even	 member 	 s 	 	of	the	fore	tribe	,	who	 we 	 re 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	 dis 	 connect 	 ed 	 	from	western	culture	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	known	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 un 	 usual 	 	 cannibal 	 ism 	 	 ritual 	 s 	 	,	 attribut 	 ed 	 	 s 	 mile 	 s 	 	to	 de 	 script 	 ions 	 	of	 situ 	 ations 	 	the	same	way	you	and	i	would	.
so	from	papua	new	guinea	to	hollywood	all	the	way	to	modern	art	in	beijing	,	we	 s 	 mile 	 	often	,	and	you	 s 	 mile 	 	to	express	joy	and	satisfaction	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	people	here	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	 s 	 mile 	 	more	than	20	 time 	 s 	 	per	day	?
raise	your	hand	if	you	do	.	oh	,	 w 	 ow 	 	.
 out 	 side 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	more	than	a	third	of	us	 s 	 mile 	 	more	than	20	 time 	 s 	 	per	day	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	less	than	14	percent	of	us	 s 	 mile 	 	less	than	five	.
in	fact	,	 t 	 hose 	 	with	the	most	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 super 	 power 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	children	,	who	 s 	 mile 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 a 	 s 	 	400	 time 	 s 	 	per	day	.

a	 re 	 cent 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	at	uppsala	university	in	sweden	found	that	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	to	frown	when	looking	at	 some 	 one 	 	who	 s 	 mile 	 s 	 	.
you	ask	,	why	?
 be 	 cause 	 	 smil 	 ing 	 	is	 evolution 	 arily 	 	 con 	 tag 	 ious 	 	,	and	it	 suppress 	 es 	 	the	control	we	 usual 	 ly 	 	have	on	our	 fa 	 cial 	 	 muscle 	 s 	 	.
 mimic 	 king 	 	a	 s 	 mile 	 	and	 ex 	 peri 	 encing 	 	it	 physical 	 ly 	 	help	us	understand	 whet 	 her 	 	our	 s 	 mile 	 	is	fake	or	real	,	so	we	can	understand	the	 emotion 	 al 	 	state	of	the	 smil 	 er 	 	.
in	a	 re 	 cent 	 	 mimic 	 king 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	at	the	university	of	clermont	-	ferrand	in	france	,	 subject 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	determine	 whet 	 her 	 	a	 s 	 mile 	 	was	real	or	fake	while	 hold 	 ing 	 	a	pencil	in	 the 	 ir 	 	mouth	to	repress	 smil 	 ing 	 	 muscle 	 s 	 	.
 with 	 out 	 	the	pencil	,	 subject 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 excel 	 lent 	 	 judg 	 es 	 	,	but	with	the	pencil	in	 the 	 ir 	 	mouth	--	when	they	could	not	mimic	the	 s 	 mile 	 	they	saw	--	 the 	 ir 	 	judgment	was	 impair 	 ed 	 	.
in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	 theor 	 izing 	 	on	evolution	in	``	the	origin	of	species	,	``	charles	darwin	 al 	 so 	 	wrote	the	 fa 	 cial 	 	 feed 	 back 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	.
his	 theor 	 y 	 	 state 	 s 	 	that	the	act	of	 smil 	 ing 	 	 it 	 self 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 make 	 s 	 	us	feel	better	--	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 smil 	 ing 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 mere 	 ly 	 	a	result	of	 feel 	 ing 	 	good	.
in	his	 stud 	 y 	 	,	darwin	 actual 	 ly 	 	 cit 	 ed 	 	a	french	 neuro 	 logist 	 	,	guillaume	duchenne	,	who	used	electric	 jol 	 ts 	 	to	 fa 	 cial 	 	 muscle 	 s 	 	to	induce	and	 stimul 	 ate 	 	 s 	 mile 	 s 	 	.
 pleas 	 e 	 	,	do	n't	try	 th 	 is 	 	at	home	.
in	a	related	german	 stud 	 y 	 	,	 research 	 ers 	 	used	fmri	 im 	 aging 	 	to	measure	brain	activity	before	and	after	 inject 	 ing 	 	botox	to	suppress	 smil 	 ing 	 	 muscle 	 s 	 	.

 smil 	 ing 	 	 stimul 	 ates 	 	our	brain	reward	 mechan 	 ism 	 	in	a	way	that	even	chocolate	--	a	well	-	 regard 	 ed 	 	pleasure	 induce 	 r 	 	--	can	not	match	.
british	 research 	 ers 	 	found	that	one	 s 	 mile 	 	can	generate	the	same	level	of	brain	 stimul 	 ation 	 	 a 	 s 	 	up	to	2,000	 bar 	 s 	 	of	chocolate	.

that	's	like	25	grand	a	 s 	 mile 	 	.
it	's	not	bad	.
and	think	about	it	 th 	 is 	 	way	:	25,000	 time 	 s 	 	400	--	 quit 	 e 	 	a	few	 kid 	 s 	 	out	there	feel	like	mark	zuckerberg	every	day	.

 smil 	 ing 	 	can	help	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	level	of	stress	-	enhancing	 hormone 	 s 	 	like	 cort 	 isol 	 	,	 adrenalin 	 e 	 	and	dopamine	,	 in 	 crease 	 	the	level	of	mood	-	enhancing	 hormone 	 s 	 	like	 endo 	 rphin 	 	and	 reduc 	 e 	 	 over 	 all 	 	blood	pressure	.
