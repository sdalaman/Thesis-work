i	'm	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	 s 	 care 	 	you	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	about	fear	,	right	?
and	you	should	be	 re 	 ally 	 	 af 	 raid 	 	,	but	not	for	the	 reason 	 s 	 	why	you	think	you	should	be	.
you	should	be	 re 	 ally 	 	 af 	 raid 	 	that	--	if	we	stick	up	the	first	slide	on	 th 	 is 	 	thing	--	there	we	go	--	that	you	're	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	out	.
 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	 s 	 pend 	 	 th 	 is 	 	week	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 ir 	 aq 	 	and	 think 	 ing 	 	about	bush	and	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	stock	market	,	you	're	going	to	 mis 	 s 	 	one	of	the	 great 	 est 	 	 adventure 	 s 	 	that	we	've	ever	 be 	 en 	 	on	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 th 	 is 	 	adventure	's	 re 	 ally 	 	about	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 crystall 	 ized 	 	dna	.
every	life	form	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	--	every	insect	,	every	bacteria	,	every	plant	,	every	animal	,	every	human	,	every	 politic 	 ian 	 	--	is	 cod 	 ed 	 	in	that	stuff	.
and	if	you	want	to	take	a	single	crystal	of	dna	,	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	that	.
and	we	're	just	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	understand	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	single	most	 excit 	 ing 	 	adventure	that	we	have	ever	 be 	 en 	 	on	.
it	's	the	single	 great 	 est 	 	mapping	project	we	've	ever	 be 	 en 	 	on	.
if	you	think	that	the	mapping	of	america	's	made	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	,	or	 land 	 ing 	 	on	the	moon	,	or	 th 	 is 	 	other	stuff	,	it	's	the	map	of	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	the	map	of	every	plant	and	every	insect	and	every	bacteria	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 make 	 s 	 	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
and	it	's	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	tell	us	a	lot	about	evolution	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	what	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	is	--	and	richard	dawkins	 ha 	 s 	 	written	about	 th 	 is 	 	--	is	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	a	river	out	of	eden	.
so	,	the	3.2	billion	base	 pair 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	each	of	your	 cell 	 s 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	a	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	where	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	for	the	past	billion	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	we	could	start	 d 	 ating 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	we	could	start	changing	medicine	and	 archeo 	 logy 	 	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	if	you	take	the	human	species	about	700	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	white	europeans	 diverge 	 d 	 	from	black	africans	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	significant	way	.
white	europeans	 we 	 re 	 	subject	to	the	plague	.
and	when	they	 we 	 re 	 	subject	to	the	plague	,	most	people	did	n't	 surviv 	 e 	 	,	but	 t 	 hose 	 	who	 surviv 	 ed 	 	had	a	mutation	on	the	ccr	5	receptor	.
and	that	mutation	was	 pass 	 ed 	 	on	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	 surviv 	 ed 	 	,	so	there	was	a	great	deal	of	population	pressure	.
in	africa	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	did	n't	have	these	cities	,	you	did	n't	have	that	ccr	5	population	pressure	mutation	.
we	can	date	it	to	700	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
that	is	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	why	 aid 	 s 	 	is	 rag 	 ing 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	africa	 a 	 s 	 	fast	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	,	and	not	 a 	 s 	 	fast	 a 	 cross 	 	europe	.
and	we	're	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	find	these	little	 thing 	 s 	 	for	malaria	,	for	 sick 	 le 	 	cell	,	for	 cancer 	 s 	 	.
and	in	the	measure	that	we	map	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	single	 great 	 est 	 	adventure	that	we	'll	ever	be	on	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	friday	,	i	want	you	to	pull	out	a	 re 	 ally 	 	good	bottle	of	wine	,	and	i	want	you	to	toast	these	two	people	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	friday	,	50	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	watson	and	crick	found	the	structure	of	dna	,	and	that	is	 al 	 most 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	a	date	 a 	 s 	 	the	12th	of	february	when	we	first	 ma 	 pped 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,
but	 any 	 way 	 	,	we	'll	get	to	that	.
i	thought	we	'd	talk	about	the	new	zoo	.
so	,	all	you	 guy 	 s 	 	have	heard	about	dna	,	all	the	stuff	that	dna	 do 	 es 	 	,	but	some	of	the	stuff	we	're	 discover 	 ing 	 	is	kind	of	nifty	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	be	the	single	most	abundant	species	on	the	planet	.
if	you	think	you	're	 success 	 ful 	 	or	 cock 	 roach 	 es 	 	are	 success 	 ful 	 	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	there	's	ten	trillion	trillion	pleurococcus	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	out	there	.
and	we	did	n't	know	that	pleurococcus	was	out	there	,
which	is	part	of	the	reason	why	 th 	 is 	 	whole	species	-	mapping	project	is	so	 import 	 ant 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	just	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	learn	where	we	came	from	and	what	we	are	.
and	we	're	 find 	 ing 	 	 amoeb 	 a 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 amoeb 	 a 	 	 dub 	 ia 	 	.
and	the	 amoeb 	 a 	 	 dub 	 ia 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	look	like	much	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	that	each	of	you	 ha 	 s 	 	about	3.2	billion	 letter 	 s 	 	,	which	is	what	 make 	 s 	 	you	you	,	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	gene	code	 in 	 side 	 	each	of	your	 cell 	 s 	 	,
and	 th 	 is 	 	little	 amoeb 	 a 	 	which	,	you	know	,	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	in	water	in	 hundred 	 s 	 	and	 million 	 s 	 	and	 billion 	 s 	 	,	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	have	620	billion	base	 pair 	 s 	 	of	gene	code	 in 	 side 	 	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	little	 thing 	 ama 	 jig 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	genome	that	's	200	 time 	 s 	 	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	 your 	 s 	 	.
and	if	you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	of	efficient	information	 s 	 to 	 rage 	 	 mechan 	 ism 	 s 	 	,	it	may	not	turn	out	to	be	 chip 	 s 	 	.
it	may	turn	out	to	be	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 look 	 s 	 	a	little	like	that	 amoeb 	 a 	 	.
and	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	we	're	 learn 	 ing 	 	from	life	and	how	life	 work 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 funk 	 y 	 	little	thing	:	people	did	n't	used	to	think	that	it	was	worth	taking	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	out	of	nuclear	 reactor 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	 danger 	 ous 	 	and	,	of	course	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	lived	there	.
and	then	 final 	 ly 	 	 some 	 body 	 	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	a	 micro 	 scope 	 	and	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	water	that	was	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	next	to	the	 core 	 s 	 	.
and	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	next	to	that	water	in	the	 core 	 s 	 	was	 th 	 is 	 	little	 de 	 ino 	 coccus 	 	 radio 	 dur 	 an 	 s 	 	,	 do 	 ing 	 	a	 back 	 stroke 	 	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 chromosom 	 es 	 	blown	 a 	 part 	 	every	day	,	six	,	seven	 time 	 s 	 	,	 re 	 stitch 	 ing 	 	them	,	living	in	about	200	 time 	 s 	 	the	 radi 	 ation 	 	that	would	kill	you	.
and	by	now	you	should	be	 get 	 ting 	 	a	hint	 a 	 s 	 	to	how	 divers 	 e 	 	and	how	 import 	 ant 	 	and	how	 interest 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	journey	 in 	 to 	 	life	is	,	and	how	 man 	 y 	 	different	life	 form 	 s 	 	there	are	,	and	how	there	can	be	different	life	 form 	 s 	 	living	in	 ver 	 y 	 	different	 place 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	even	 out 	 side 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	planet	.
 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	can	live	in	 radi 	 ation 	 	that	 look 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	that	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	up	a	whole	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	 question 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	little	 thing 	 ama 	 jig 	 	:	we	did	n't	know	 th 	 is 	 	 thing 	 ama 	 jig 	 	 exist 	 ed 	 	.
we	should	have	known	that	 th 	 is 	 	 exist 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	bacteria	that	you	can	see	to	the	naked	eye	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	thing	is	0.75	 millimeter 	 s 	 	.
it	 live 	 s 	 	in	a	deep	trench	off	the	coast	of	namibia	.
and	what	you	're	looking	at	with	 th 	 is 	 	namibiensis	is	the	 big 	 gest 	 	bacteria	we	've	ever	 s 	 een 	 	.
so	,	it	's	about	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	little	period	on	a	sentence	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	we	did	n't	know	 th 	 is 	 	thing	was	there	three	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
we	're	just	 begin 	 ning 	 	 th 	 is 	 	journey	of	life	in	the	new	zoo	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 re 	 ally 	 	odd	one	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	ferroplasma	.
the	reason	why	ferroplasma	is	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	it	eats	iron	,	 live 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	 batt 	 ery 	 	acid	,	and	 excrete 	 s 	 	 sulfur 	 ic 	 	acid	.
so	,	when	you	think	of	odd	life	 form 	 s 	 	,	when	you	think	of	what	it	 take 	 s 	 	to	live	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	efficient	life	form	,
and	they	call	it	an	 arch 	 aea 	 	.	 arch 	 aea 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	``	the	ancient	 one 	 s 	 	.	``
and	the	reason	why	they	're	ancient	is	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	thing	came	up	when	 th 	 is 	 	planet	was	 cover 	 ed 	 	by	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 sulfur 	 ic 	 	acid	in	 batt 	 eries 	 	,	and	it	was	eating	iron	when	the	earth	was	part	of	a	 melt 	 ed 	 	core	.
so	,	it	's	not	just	 dog 	 s 	 	and	 cat 	 s 	 	and	 whale 	 s 	 	and	 dolphin 	 s 	 	that	you	should	be	aware	of	and	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	on	 th 	 is 	 	little	journey	.
your	fear	should	be	that	you	are	not	,	that	you	're	 pay 	 ing 	 	attention	to	stuff	which	is	temporal	.
i	mean	,	george	bush	--	he	's	going	to	be	gone	,	 al 	 right 	 	?	life	is	n't	.
 whet 	 her 	 	the	 human 	 s 	 	 surviv 	 e 	 	or	do	n't	 surviv 	 e 	 	,	these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	going	to	be	living	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	or	other	 planet 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	just	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	understand	 th 	 is 	 	code	of	dna
that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	the	most	 excit 	 ing 	 	intellectual	adventure	that	we	've	ever	 be 	 en 	 	on	.
and	you	can	do	strange	 thing 	 s 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	baby	gar	.
 conserv 	 ation 	 	group	 get 	 s 	 	together	,	tries	to	figure	out	how	to	breed	an	animal	that	's	 al 	 most 	 	extinct	.
they	ca	n't	do	it	 natural 	 ly 	 	,	so	what	they	do	with	 th 	 is 	 	thing	is	they	take	a	spoon	,	take	some	 cell 	 s 	 	out	of	an	adult	gar	's	mouth	,	code	,	take	the	 cell 	 s 	 	from	that	and	insert	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	 fertil 	 ized 	 	cow	's	egg	,	 re 	 program 	 	cow	's	egg	--	different	gene	code	.
when	you	do	that	,	the	cow	 give 	 s 	 	birth	to	a	gar	.
we	are	now	 experiment 	 ing 	 	with	 bong 	 os 	 	,	 pan 	 da 	 s 	 	,	elims	,	sumatran	 tiger 	 s 	 	,	and	the	australians	--	bless	 the 	 ir 	 	 heart 	 s 	 	--	are	 play 	 ing 	 	with	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
now	,	the	last	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 di 	 ed 	 	in	september	1936	.
these	are	tasmanian	 tiger 	 s 	 	.	the	last	known	one	 di 	 ed 	 	at	the	hobart	zoo	.
but	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	 a 	 s 	 	we	learn	more	about	gene	code	and	how	to	 re 	 program 	 	species	,	we	may	be	able	to	close	the	gene	 gap 	 s 	 	in	 deterio 	 rate 	 	dna	.
and	when	we	learn	how	to	close	the	gene	 gap 	 s 	 	,	then	we	can	put	a	full	string	of	dna	together	.
and	if	we	do	that	,	and	insert	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 fertil 	 ized 	 	wolf	's	egg	,	we	may	give	birth	to	an	animal	that	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 walk 	 ed 	 	the	earth	since	1936	.
and	then	you	can	start	going	back	further	,	and	you	can	start	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 do 	 do 	 s 	 	,	and	you	can	think	about	other	species	.
and	in	other	 place 	 s 	 	,	like	maryland	,	they	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	what	the	primordial	 ance 	 s 	 tor 	 	is	.
 be 	 cause 	 	each	of	us	 contain 	 s 	 	our	entire	gene	code	of	where	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	for	the	past	billion	 year 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	've	 evolv 	 ed 	 	from	that	stuff	,	you	can	take	that	tree	of	life	and	collapse	it	back	,
and	in	the	measure	that	you	learn	to	 re 	 program 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	we	'll	give	birth	to	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	 ver 	 y 	 	close	to	the	first	primordial	 ooz 	 e 	 	.
and	it	's	all	coming	out	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	look	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
these	are	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	that	did	n't	exist	five	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.

we	will	have	a	1,000	-	dollar	genome	 with 	 in 	 	the	next	five	to	eight	 year 	 s 	 	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	each	of	you	will	contain	on	a	cd	your	entire	gene	code	.
and	it	will	be	 re 	 ally 	 	 bor 	 ing 	 	.	it	will	read	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
the	 re 	 ally 	 	neat	thing	about	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	is	that	's	life	.
and	laurie	's	going	to	talk	about	 th 	 is 	 	one	a	little	bit	.
 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	happen	to	find	 th 	 is 	 	one	 in 	 side 	 	your	body	,	you	're	in	big	trouble	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	the	source	code	for	 eb 	 ola 	 	.
that	's	one	of	the	 dead 	 liest 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	known	to	 human 	 s 	 	.
but	 plant 	 s 	 	work	the	same	way	and	 insect 	 s 	 	work	the	same	way	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	apple	 work 	 s 	 	the	same	way	.
 th 	 is 	 	apple	is	the	same	thing	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 flop 	 py 	 	 dis 	 k 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	thing	 code 	 s 	 	 one 	 s 	 	and	 zero 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	thing	 code 	 s 	 	a	,	t	,	c	,	gs	,	and	it	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	up	there	,	 absorb 	 ing 	 	energy	on	a	tree	,	and	one	fine	day	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	energy	to	say	,	execute	,	and	it	 go 	 es 	 	[	thump	]	.	right	?
and	when	it	 do 	 es 	 	that	,	 push 	 es 	 	a	.	exe	,	what	it	 do 	 es 	 	is	,	it	 execute 	 s 	 	the	first	line	of	code	,	which	 read 	 s 	 	just	like	that	,	aatcagggaccc	,	and	that	 mean 	 s 	 	:	make	a	root	.
next	line	of	code	:	make	a	stem	.
next	line	of	code	,	tacgggg	:	make	a	flower	that	's	white	,	that	 bloom 	 s 	 	in	the	spring	,	that	 smell 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
in	the	measure	that	you	have	the	code	and	the	measure	that	you	read	it	--
and	,	by	the	way	,	the	first	plant	was	read	two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	;	the	first	human	was	read	two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	;	the	first	insect	was	read	two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.	the	first	thing	that	we	ever	read	was	in	1995	:	a	little	bacteria	 call 	 ed 	 	haemophilus	 influenza 	 e 	 	.
in	the	measure	that	you	have	the	source	code	,	 a 	 s 	 	all	of	you	know	,	you	can	change	the	source	code	,	and	you	can	 re 	 program 	 	life	 form 	 s 	 	so	that	 th 	 is 	 	little	 thing 	 y 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	 vaccin 	 e 	 	,	or	 th 	 is 	 	little	 thing 	 y 	 	 start 	 s 	 	producing	 bio 	 material 	 s 	 	,
which	is	why	dupont	is	now	growing	a	form	of	 pol 	 yester 	 	that	 feel 	 s 	 	like	silk	in	corn	.
 th 	 is 	 	 change 	 s 	 	all	 rule 	 s 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	life	,	but	we	're	 re 	 programm 	 ing 	 	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	you	look	like	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	your	 chromosom 	 es 	 	.
and	what	you	can	do	now	is	,	you	can	 out 	 lay 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	your	 chromosom 	 e 	 	is	,	and	what	the	gene	code	on	that	 chromosom 	 e 	 	is	right	here	,	and	what	 t 	 hose 	 	 gene 	 s 	 	code	for	,	and	what	 animal 	 s 	 	they	code	against	,	and	then	you	can	tie	it	to	the	 liter 	 ature 	 	.
and	in	the	measure	that	you	can	do	that	,	you	can	go	home	 to 	 day 	 	,	and	get	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	and	access	the	world	's	 big 	 gest 	 	public	library	,	which	is	a	library	of	life	.
and	you	can	do	some	 pre 	 tty 	 	strange	 thing 	 s 	 
 be 	 cause 	 	in	the	same	way	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	 re 	 program 	 	 th 	 is 	 	apple	,	if	you	go	to	cliff	tabin	's	lab	at	the	harvard	medical	school	,	he	's	 re 	 programm 	 ing 	 	chicken	 embryo 	 s 	 	to	grow	more	 wing 	 s 	 	.
why	would	cliff	be	 do 	 ing 	 	that	?	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	a	restaurant	.
the	reason	why	he	's	 re 	 programm 	 ing 	 	that	animal	to	have	more	 wing 	 s 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	when	you	used	to	play	with	 lizard 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	little	child	,	and	you	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	the	lizard	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	the	tail	fell	off	,	but	it	 re 	 grew 	 	.
