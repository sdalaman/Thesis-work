 dog 	 s 	 	have	 interest 	 s 	 	.
they	have	interest	 sniff 	 ing 	 	each	other	,	chasing	 squirrel 	 s 	 	.
and	if	we	do	n't	make	that	a	reward	in	training	,	that	will	be	a	 distract 	 ion 	 	.
it	's	 al 	 ways 	 	sort	of	 s 	 truck 	 	me	 a 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	a	 scar 	 y 	 	thought	that	if	you	see	a	dog	in	a	park	,	and	the	owner	is	 call 	 ing 	 	it	,	and	the	owner	 say 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	``	puppy	,	come	here	,	come	here	,	``	and	the	dog	 think 	 s 	 	,	``	hmm	,	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
i	'm	 sniff 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	other	dog	's	rear	end	,	the	owner	's	 call 	 ing 	 	.	``	it	's	a	difficult	choice	,	right	?
i	mean	,	you	lose	.
you	can	not	compete	with	the	environment	,	if	you	have	an	adolescent	dog	's	brain	.
so	,	when	we	train	,	we	're	 al 	 ways 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	take	 in 	 to 	 	account	the	dog	's	point	of	view	.
now	,	i	'm	here	 large 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	kind	of	a	rift	in	dog	training	at	the	moment	that	--	on	one	side	,	we	have	people	who	think	that	you	train	a	dog	,	number	one	,	by	making	up	 rule 	 s 	 	,	human	 rule 	 s 	 	.	we	do	n't	take	the	dog	's	point	of	view	 in 	 to 	 	account	.
so	the	human	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	you	're	going	to	act	 th 	 is 	 	way	,	damn	it	.
we	're	going	to	force	you	to	act	against	your	will	,	to	bend	to	our	will	.	``	then	,	number	two	,	we	keep	these	 rule 	 s 	 	a	secret	from	the	dog	.
and	then	number	three	,	now	we	can	punish	the	dog	for	 break 	 ing 	 	 rule 	 s 	 	he	did	n't	even	know	 exist 	 ed 	 	.	so	you	get	a	little	puppy	,	he	 come 	 s 	 	.	his	 on 	 ly 	 	crime	is	he	grew	.
when	he	was	a	little	puppy	,	he	 put 	 s 	 	his	 paw 	 s 	 	on	your	leg	--	you	know	,	is	n't	that	nice	?	and	you	go	,	``	oh	,	there	's	a	good	boy	.	``	you	bend	down	,	you	pat	him	--	you	reward	him	for	 jump 	 ing 	 	up	.
his	one	 mistak 	 e 	 	is	he	's	a	tibetan	 ma 	 stiff 	 	,	and	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	he	 weigh 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	80	 pound 	 s 	 	.
every	time	he	 jump 	 s 	 	up	,	he	 get 	 s 	 	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	abuse	.
i	mean	,	it	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 scar 	 y 	 	the	abuse	that	 dog 	 s 	 	get	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	whole	 domin 	 ance 	 	issue	--	number	one	,	what	we	get	in	dog	training	is	 th 	 is 	 	mickey	-	mouse	 interpret 	 ation 	 	of	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	social	system	.
and	they	take	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	 serious 	 ly 	 	.
male	 dog 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	serious	about	a	 hierarch 	 y 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 prevent 	 s 	 	physical	 fight 	 s 	 	.
of	course	,	female	 dog 	 s 	 	,	 bitch 	 es 	 	,	on	the	other	hand	,	have	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	bitch	 amend 	 ments 	 	to	male	 hierarch 	 ical 	 	rule	.
the	number	one	is	,	``	i	have	it	,	you	do	n't	.	``
and	what	you	will	find	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	low	-	 rank 	 ing 	 	bitch	will	 quit 	 e 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	keep	a	bone	away	from	a	high	-	 rank 	 ing 	 	male	.
so	,	we	get	in	dog	training	 th 	 is 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	of	 domin 	 ance 	 s 	 	,	or	of	the	alpha	dog	.	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	that	you	've	heard	 th 	 is 	 	.
 dog 	 s 	 	get	so	 abuse 	 d 	 	.
 dog 	 s 	 	,	 horse 	 s 	 	and	 human 	 s 	 	--	these	are	the	three	species	which	are	so	 abuse 	 d 	 	in	life	.
and	the	reason	is	built	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	behavior	--	is	to	 al 	 ways 	 	come	back	and	 apolog 	 ize 	 	.
like	,	``	oh	,	i	'm	sorry	you	had	to	beat	me	.	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	sorry	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	it	's	my	fault	.	``
they	are	just	so	 beat 	 able 	 	,
and	that	's	why	they	get	 beat 	 en 	 	.
the	poor	puppy	 jump 	 s 	 	up	,	you	open	the	dog	book	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	it	say	?	``	hold	his	front	 paw 	 s 	 	,	 squeez 	 e 	 	his	front	 paw 	 s 	 	,	stamp	on	his	hind	feet	,	squirt	him	in	the	face	with	lemon	juice	,	hit	him	on	the	head	with	a	 roll 	 ed 	 	-	up	 news 	 paper 	 	,	knee	him	in	the	chest	,	flip	him	over	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	.	``	 be 	 cause 	 	he	grew	?
and	 be 	 cause 	 	he	's	 perform 	 ing 	 	a	behavior	you	've	trained	him	to	do	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	 insan 	 ity 	 	.
i	ask	 owner 	 s 	 	,	``	well	,	how	would	you	like	the	dog	to	greet	you	?	``	and	people	say	,	``	well	,	i	do	n't	know	,	to	 s 	 it 	 	,	i	guess	.	``	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	let	's	teach	him	to	 s 	 it 	 	.	``	and	then	we	give	him	a	reason	for	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	first	stage	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	 teach 	 ing 	 	a	dog	esl	.
i	could	speak	to	you	and	say	,	``	laytay	-	chai	,	paisey	,	paisey	.	``	go	on	,	 some 	 thing 	 	should	happen	now	.
why	are	n't	you	 respond 	 ing 	 	?	oh	,	you	do	n't	speak	swahili	.
well	,	i	've	got	news	for	you	.	the	dog	 do 	 es 	 	n't	speak	english	,	or	american	,	or	spanish	,	or	french	.
so	the	first	stage	in	training	is	to	teach	the	dog	esl	,	english	 a 	 s 	 	a	second	language	.
and	that	's	how	we	use	the	food	lure	in	the	hand	,	and	we	use	food	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	 owner 	 s 	 	.
my	wife	 do 	 es 	 	n't	need	food	--	she	's	a	great	 train 	 er 	 	,
much	better	than	i	am	.	i	do	n't	need	food	,	but	the	average	owner	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	puppy	,	 s 	 it 	 	.	``	or	they	go	,	``	 s 	 it 	 	,	 s 	 it 	 	,	 s 	 it 	 	.	``	they	're	making	a	hand	signal	in	front	of	the	dog	's	 rect 	 um 	 	for	some	reason	,	like	the	dog	 ha 	 s 	 	a	third	eye	there	--	it	's	 insan 	 e 	 	.
you	know	,	``	 s 	 it 	 	,	 s 	 it 	 	.	``	no	,	we	go	,	``	puppy	,	 s 	 it 	 	``	--	boom	,	it	's	got	it	in	six	to	10	 trial 	 s 	 	.
then	we	phase	out	the	food	 a 	 s 	 	a	lure	,	and	now	the	dog	 know 	 s 	 	that	``	 s 	 it 	 	``	 mean 	 s 	 	 s 	 it 	 	,
and	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	communicate	to	a	dog	in	a	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 construct 	 ed 	 	english	sentence	.
``	phoenix	,	come	here	,	take	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	go	to	jamie	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	.	``	and	i	've	taught	her	``	phoenix	,	``	``	come	here	,	``	``	take	 th 	 is 	 	,	``	``	go	to	``	and	the	name	of	my	son	,	``	jamie	.	``
and	the	dog	can	take	a	note	,	and	i	've	got	my	own	little	search	-	and	-	 rescu 	 e 	 	dog	.
he	'll	find	jamie	 where 	 ver 	 	he	is	,	you	know	,	 where 	 ver 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	are	,	 crush 	 ing 	 	 rock 	 s 	 	by	a	stream	or	 some 	 thing 	 	,	and	take	him	a	little	 mess 	 age 	 	that	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	 d 	 inner 	 	's	ready	.	come	in	for	 d 	 inner 	 	.	``	so	,	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	the	dog	 know 	 s 	 	what	we	want	it	to	do	.
will	it	do	it	?
not	 necess 	 arily 	 	,	no	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	if	he	's	in	the	park	and	there	's	a	rear	end	to	sniff	,	why	come	to	the	owner	?
the	dog	 live 	 s 	 	with	you	,	the	dog	can	get	you	any	time	.	the	dog	can	sniff	your	butt	,	if	you	like	,	when	he	 want 	 s 	 	to	.
at	the	moment	,	he	's	in	the	park	,	and	you	are	 com 	 pet 	 ing 	 	with	 smell 	 s 	 	,	and	other	 dog 	 s 	 	,	and	 squirrel 	 s 	 	.
so	the	second	stage	in	training	is	to	teach	the	dog	to	want	to	do	what	we	want	him	to	do	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	.
we	use	the	premack	principle	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	,	we	follow	a	low	-	frequency	behavior	--	one	the	dog	 do 	 es 	 	n't	want	to	do	--	by	a	high	-	frequency	behavior	,	 common 	 ly 	 	known	 a 	 s 	 	a	behavior	problem	,	or	a	dog	hobby	--	 some 	 thing 	 	the	dog	 do 	 es 	 	like	to	do	.
that	will	then	 be 	 come 	 	a	reward	for	the	lower	-	frequency	behavior	.
so	we	go	,	``	 s 	 it 	 	,	``	on	the	couch	;	``	 s 	 it 	 	,	``	tummy	-	rub	;	``	 s 	 it 	 	,	``
look	,	i	throw	a	tennis	ball	;	``	 s 	 it 	 	,	``	say	 hell 	 o 	 	to	that	other	dog	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	we	put	``	sniff	butt	``	on	queue	.
``	 s 	 it 	 	,	``	sniff	butt	.
so	now	all	of	these	 distract 	 ions 	 	that	 work 	 ed 	 	against	training	now	 be 	 come 	 	 reward 	 s 	 	that	work	for	training	.
and	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	,	in	 es 	 s 	 ence 	 	,	is	we	're	 teach 	 ing 	 	the	dog	,	kind	of	like	--	we	're	 lett 	 ing 	 	the	dog	think	that	the	dog	is	training	us	.
and	i	can	imagine	 th 	 is 	 	dog	,	you	know	,	 s 	 peaking 	 	through	the	 f 	 ence 	 	to	,	say	,	an	akita	,	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	 w 	 ow 	 	,	my	 owner 	 s 	 	,	they	are	so	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	easy	to	train	.
they	're	like	 gold 	 en 	 	retrievers	.
all	i	have	to	do	is	 s 	 it 	 	,	and	they	do	 every 	 thing 	 	.
they	open	 door 	 s 	 	,	they	drive	my	car	,	they	 mass 	 age 	 	me	,	they	will	throw	tennis	 ball 	 s 	 	,	they	will	cook	for	me	and	serve	the	food	.
it	's	like	,	if	i	just	 s 	 it 	 	,	that	's	my	command	.	then	i	have	my	own	personal	 door 	 man 	 	,	 cha 	 uffeur 	 	,	 masse 	 use 	 	,	chef	and	 wait 	 er 	 	.	``	and	now	the	dog	's	 re 	 ally 	 	happy	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	,	to	me	,	is	 al 	 ways 	 	what	training	is	.
so	we	 re 	 ally 	 	 motiv 	 ate 	 	the	dog	to	want	to	do	it	,	 s 	 uch 	 	that	the	need	for	 punish 	 ment 	 	seldom	 come 	 s 	 	up	.
now	we	move	to	phase	three	,	when	now	--
there	's	 time 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	when	 d 	 addy 	 	 know 	 s 	 	best	.
and	i	have	a	little	sign	on	my	 f 	 ridge 	 	,	and	it	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	the	 d 	 addy 	 	,	that	's	why	.	``
sorry	,	no	more	 explan 	 ation 	 	.	``	i	'm	the	 d 	 addy 	 	,	you	're	not	.	 s 	 it 	 	.	``	and	there	's	 time 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	if	my	son	's	 friend 	 s 	 	 leav 	 e 	 	the	door	open	,	the	 dog 	 s 	 	have	to	know	you	do	n't	step	 a 	 cross 	 	 th 	 is 	 	line	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	life	-	or	-	death	thing	.
you	 leav 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	the	 sanct 	 ity 	 	of	your	house	,	and	you	could	be	hit	on	the	street	.
so	some	 thing 	 s 	 	we	have	to	let	the	dog	know	,	``	you	must	n't	do	 th 	 is 	 	.	``	and	so	we	have	to	enforce	,	but	 with 	 out 	 	force	.
people	here	get	 ver 	 y 	 	 con 	 fused 	 	about	what	a	 punish 	 ment 	 	is	.
they	think	a	 punish 	 ment 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	nasty	.
i	bet	a	lot	of	you	do	,	right	?
you	think	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	 pain 	 ful 	 	,	or	 scar 	 y 	 	,	or	nasty	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	to	be	.
there	's	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 definition 	 s 	 	of	what	a	 punish 	 ment 	 	is	,
but	one	definition	,	the	most	popular	,	is	:	a	 punish 	 ment 	 	is	a	 stimul 	 us 	 	that	 reduc 	 es 	 	the	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	 p 	 reced 	 ing 	 	behavior	,	 s 	 uch 	 	that	it	's	less	 like 	 ly 	 	to	occur	in	the	future	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	not	have	to	be	nasty	,	 scar 	 y 	 	or	 pain 	 ful 	 	.
and	i	would	say	,	if	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	to	be	,	then	 may 	 be 	 	it	should	n't	be	.
i	was	 work 	 ing 	 	with	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	dog	about	a	year	ago	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	dog	that	put	both	his	 owner 	 s 	 	in	hospital	,	plus	the	brother	-	in	-	law	,	plus	the	child	.
and	i	 on 	 ly 	 	 agree 	 d 	 	to	work	with	it	if	they	 promise 	 d 	 	it	would	stay	in	 the 	 ir 	 	house	,	and	they	never	took	it	 out 	 side 	 	.
the	dog	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 euthanize 	 d 	 	now	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	dog	i	 work 	 ed 	 	with	for	a	while	.
a	lot	of	the	 aggress 	 ion 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	around	the	kitchen	,
so	while	i	was	there	--	 th 	 is 	 	was	on	the	fourth	visit	--	we	did	a	four	and	a	half	hour	down	-	stay	,	with	the	dog	on	his	mat	.
and	he	was	 ke 	 pt 	 	there	by	the	owner	's	calm	 insist 	 ence 	 	.
when	the	dog	would	try	to	 leav 	 e 	 	the	mat	,	she	would	say	,	``	 r 	 over 	 	,	on	the	mat	,	on	the	mat	,	on	the	mat	.	``
the	dog	broke	his	down	-	stay	22	 time 	 s 	 	in	four	and	a	half	 hour 	 s 	 	,	while	she	 cook 	 ed 	 	 d 	 inner 	 	,
 be 	 cause 	 	we	had	a	lot	of	 aggress 	 ion 	 	related	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	food	.
the	 break 	 s 	 	got	 few 	 er 	 	and	 few 	 er 	 	.
you	see	,	the	 punish 	 ment 	 	was	 work 	 ing 	 	.
the	behavior	problem	was	going	away	.
she	never	raised	her	voice	.
if	she	did	,	she	would	have	got	bitten	.
it	's	not	a	good	dog	you	shout	at	.
and	a	lot	of	my	 friend 	 s 	 	train	 re 	 ally 	 	neat	 animal 	 s 	 	,	 grizz 	 ly 	 	 bear 	 s 	 	--	if	you	've	ever	 s 	 een 	 	a	 grizz 	 ly 	 	bear	on	the	 tell 	 y 	 	or	in	film	,	then	it	's	a	friend	of	mine	who	's	trained	it	--
how	are	you	going	to	reprimand	a	 grizz 	 ly 	 	bear	?
``	bad	bear	,	bad	bear	!	``	voom	!
your	head	now	is	100	 yard 	 s 	 	away	,	 s 	 ailing 	 	through	the	air	,	ok	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	crazy	.
so	,	where	do	we	go	from	here	?
we	want	a	better	way	.
 dog 	 s 	 	deserve	better	.
but	for	me	,	the	reason	for	 th 	 is 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	with	 dog 	 s 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	with	 watch 	 ing 	 	people	train	 pup 	 pies 	 	,	and	 real 	 izing 	 	they	have	 horr 	 end 	 ous 	 	 interact 	 ion 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	,	 horr 	 end 	 ous 	 	relationship	 skill 	 s 	 	.
not	just	with	 the 	 ir 	 	puppy	,	but	with	the	rest	of	the	family	at	class	.
i	mean	,	my	all	-	time	classic	is	 an 	 other 	 	``	come	here	``	one	.
you	see	 some 	 one 	 	in	the	park	--	and	i	'll	cover	my	mic	when	i	say	 th 	 is 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	do	n't	want	to	wake	you	up	--	and	there	's	the	owner	in	the	park	,	and	 the 	 ir 	 	dog	's	over	here	,	and	they	say	,	``	 r 	 over 	 	,	come	here	.
 r 	 over 	 	,	come	here	.	 r 	 over 	 	,	come	here	,	you	son	of	a	bitch	.	``
the	dog	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	do	n't	think	so	.	``	i	mean	,	who	in	 the 	 ir 	 	right	mind	would	think	that	a	dog	would	want	to	approach	them	when	they	're	 s 	 cream 	 ing 	 	like	that	?
 in 	 stead 	 	,	the	dog	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	know	that	tone	.	i	know	that	tone	.	 previous 	 ly 	 	,	when	i	've	 approach 	 ed 	 	,	i	've	gotten	 punish 	 ed 	 	there	.	``	i	was	 walk 	 ing 	 	onto	a	plane	--	 th 	 is 	 	,	for	me	,	was	a	 pivot 	 al 	 	moment	in	my	 care 	 er 	 	,	and	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 cement 	 ed 	 	what	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	with	 th 	 is 	 	whole	puppy	-	training	thing	,	the	 not 	 ion 	 	of	how	to	teach	 pup 	 pies 	 	in	a	dog	-	friendly	way	to	want	to	do	what	we	want	to	do	,	so	we	do	n't	have	to	force	them	.
you	know	,	i	puppy	-	train	my	child	.
and	the	 semi 	 nal 	 	moment	was	,	i	was	 get 	 ting 	 	on	a	plane	in	dallas	,	and	in	row	two	was	a	father	,	i	 p 	 resume 	 	,	and	a	young	boy	about	five	,

``	johnny	,	do	n't	do	that	.	``	kick	,	kick	,	kick	.
i	'm	 stand 	 ing 	 	right	here	with	my	bag	.
the	father	 lean 	 s 	 	over	,	 grab 	 s 	 	him	like	 th 	 is 	 	and	 give 	 s 	 	him	 ug 	 ly 	 	face	.
and	 ug 	 ly 	 	face	is	 th 	 is 	 	--
when	you	go	face	-	to	-	face	with	a	puppy	or	a	child	,	you	say	,	``	what	are	you	 do 	 ing 	 	!	now	stop	it	,	stop	it	,	stop	it	!	``	and	i	went	,	``	oh	my	god	,	do	i	do	 some 	 thing 	 	?	``	that	child	 ha 	 s 	 	lost	 every 	 thing 	 	--	that	one	of	the	two	people	he	can	trust	in	 th 	 is 	 	world	 ha 	 s 	 	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 pull 	 ed 	 	the	rug	from	under	his	feet	.
and	i	thought	,	``	do	i	tell	 th 	 is 	 	jerk	to	quit	it	?	``	i	thought	,	``	ian	,	stay	out	of	it	,	stay	out	of	it	,	you	know	,	walk	on	.	``	i	 walk 	 ed 	 	to	the	back	of	the	plane	,
i	 s 	 at 	 	down	,	and	a	thought	came	to	me	.
if	that	had	 be 	 en 	 	a	dog	,	i	would	have	laid	him	out	.
if	he	had	 kick 	 ed 	 	a	dog	,	i	would	have	 punch 	 ed 	 	him	out	.
he	 kick 	 ed 	 	a	child	,	 grab 	 s 	 	the	child	like	 th 	 is 	 	and	i	let	it	go	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	's	all	about	.
these	relationship	 skill 	 s 	 	are	so	easy	.
i	mean	,	we	 a 	 s 	 	 human 	 s 	 	,	our	 sh 	 allow 	 ness 	 	when	we	 choos 	 e 	 	a	life	-	mate	based	on	the	three	cs	--	coat	color	,	 conform 	 ation 	 	,	 cute 	 ness 	 	.
you	know	,	kind	of	like	a	little	robot	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	how	we	go	 in 	 to 	 	a	relationship	,	and	it	's	 hunk 	 y 	 	-	 d 	 ory 	 	for	a	year	.
and	then	,	a	little	behavior	problem	 come 	 s 	 	up	.	no	different	from	the	dog	 bark 	 ing 	 	.
the	husband	wo	n't	clear	up	his	 clothe 	 s 	 	,	or	the	wife	's	 al 	 ways 	 	late	for	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	,	ok	?
and	our	personal	 feed 	 back 	 	--	there	's	two	 thing 	 s 	 	about	it	.
when	you	watch	people	 interact 	 ing 	 	with	 animal 	 s 	 	or	other	people	,	there	is	 ver 	 y 	 	little	 feed 	 back 	 	,	it	's	too	 in 	 frequent 	 	.
and	when	it	 happen 	 s 	 	,	it	's	bad	,	it	's	nasty	.
you	see	it	's	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	in	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	with	 spouse 	 s 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	with	children	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	with	 parent 	 s 	 	.	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	from	 bo 	 s 	 s 	 	to	 employ 	 ee 	 	.
it	's	 a 	 s 	 	if	there	's	some	 sch 	 adenfreude 	 	there	,
that	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	take	 de 	 light 	 	in	people	 get 	 ting 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	wrong	,	so	that	we	can	then	moan	and	groan	and	bitch	at	them	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	would	say	,	is	the	 big 	 gest 	 	human	 fo 	 ible 	 	that	we	have	.
it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	.
we	take	the	good	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	,	and	we	moan	and	groan	at	the	bad	.
and	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	whole	 not 	 ion 	 	of	these	 skill 	 s 	 	should	be	taught	.
you	know	,	 calcul 	 us 	 	is	 wonder 	 ful 	 	.
when	i	was	a	kid	,	i	was	a	 calcul 	 us 	 	whiz	.
i	do	n't	understand	a	thing	about	it	now	,	but	i	could	do	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	kid	.
 geo 	 metry 	 	,	fantastic	.	you	know	,	 quant 	 um 	 	 mechanic 	 s 	 	--	these	are	cool	 thing 	 s 	 	.
but	they	do	n't	 s 	 ave 	 	 marriage 	 s 	 	and	they	do	n't	raise	children	.
and	my	look	to	the	future	is	,	and	what	i	want	to	do	with	 th 	 is 	 	 dog 	 gy 	 	stuff	,	is	to	teach	people	that	you	know	,	your	husband	's	just	 a 	 s 	 	easy	to	train	.
 prob 	 ably 	 	 eas 	 ier 	 	--	if	you	got	a	rottie	--	much	 eas 	 ier 	 	to	train	.
your	 kid 	 s 	 	are	easy	to	train	.
all	you	've	got	to	do	is	to	watch	them	,	to	time	-	 s 	 ample 	 	the	behavior	,	and	say	,	every	five	 minute 	 s 	 	,	you	ask	the	question	,	``	is	it	good	,	or	is	it	bad	?	``
if	it	's	good	,	say	,	``	that	was	 re 	 ally 	 	neat	,	thank	you	.	``
that	is	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 power 	 ful 	 	training	 techni 	 que 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	should	be	taught	in	 school 	 s 	 	.
 relationship 	 s 	 	--	how	do	you	 negoti 	 ate 	 	?
how	you	do	 negoti 	 ate 	 	with	your	friend	who	 want 	 s 	 	your	 to 	 y 	 	?
you	know	,	how	to	 prep 	 are 	 	you	for	your	first	relationship	?
how	on	earth	about	raising	children	?
we	think	how	we	do	it	--	one	night	in	bed	,	we	're	 pregn 	 ant 	 	,	and	then	we	're	raising	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	in	life	,	a	child	.
no	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	should	be	taught	--	the	good	living	,	the	good	 habit 	 s 	 	,	which	are	just	 a 	 s 	 	hard	to	break	 a 	 s 	 	bad	 habit 	 s 	 	.
so	,	that	would	be	my	wish	to	the	future	.
