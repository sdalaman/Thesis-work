the	 care 	 er 	 	that	i	 start 	 ed 	 	early	on	in	my	life	was	looking	for	 ex 	 otic 	 	life	 form 	 s 	 	in	 ex 	 otic 	 	 place 	 s 	 	,	and	at	that	time	i	was	 work 	 ing 	 	in	the	antarctic	and	the	 arc 	 tic 	 	,	and	high	 desert 	 s 	 	and	low	 desert 	 s 	 	.
 un 	 til 	 	about	a	dozen	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	when	i	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 capture 	 d 	 	by	 cave 	 s 	 	,	and	i	 re 	 ally 	 	re	-	focused	most	of	my	research	in	that	direction	.
so	i	have	a	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	day	job	--	i	get	to	do	some	 re 	 ally 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	stuff	.
i	work	in	some	of	the	most	 extrem 	 e 	 	cave	 environment 	 s 	 	on	the	planet	.
 man 	 y 	 	of	them	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	kill	us	from	the	minute	we	go	 in 	 to 	 	them	,	but	 never 	 the 	 less 	 	,	they	're	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 grip 	 ping 	 	,	and	contain	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	 bio 	 logical 	 	 wonder 	 s 	 	that	are	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	different	from	 t 	 hose 	 	that	we	have	on	the	planet	.
 a 	 part 	 	from	the	intrinsic	value	of	the	biology	and	 mineral 	 ogy 	 	and	geo	-	 micro 	 biology 	 	that	we	do	there	,	we	're	 al 	 so 	 	using	these	 a 	 s 	 	 template 	 s 	 	for	 figur 	 ing 	 	out	how	to	go	look	for	life	on	other	 planet 	 s 	 	.
 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	mars	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	europa	,	the	small	,	 ic 	 y 	 	moon	around	jupiter	.
and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	 some 	 day 	 	,	far	beyond	our	solar	system	 it 	 self 	 	.
i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	 passionate 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	human	future	,	on	the	moon	and	mars	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	,	and	 else 	 where 	 	in	the	solar	system	.
i	think	it	's	time	that	we	 transit 	 ion 	 ed 	 	to	a	solar	system	-	going	 civil 	 ization 	 	and	species	.
and	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	 out 	 growth 	 	of	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	then	,	i	wonder	about	 whet 	 her 	 	we	can	,	and	 whet 	 her 	 	we	even	should	,	think	about	 transport 	 ing 	 	earth	-	type	life	to	other	 planet 	 s 	 	.
 not 	 ably 	 	mars	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	first	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
 some 	 thing 	 	i	never	talk	about	in	scientific	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	is	how	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	got	to	 th 	 is 	 	state	and	why	i	do	the	work	that	i	do	.
why	do	n't	i	have	a	normal	job	,	a	 sens 	 ible 	 	job	?
and	then	of	course	,	i	blame	the	soviet	 un 	 ion 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	in	the	mid	-	1950s	,	when	i	was	a	 tin 	 y 	 	child	,	they	had	the	 au 	 da 	 city 	 	to	launch	a	 ver 	 y 	 	primitive	little	satellite	 call 	 ed 	 	sputnik	,	which	 s 	 ent 	 	the	western	world	 in 	 to 	 	a	 hyster 	 ical 	 	 tail 	 spin 	 	.
and	a	tremendous	amount	of	money	went	 in 	 to 	 	the	 fund 	 ing 	 	of	science	and	 mathematic 	 s 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	for	 kid 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'm	a	product	of	that	generation	,	like	so	 man 	 y 	 	other	of	my	 peer 	 s 	 	.
it	 re 	 ally 	 	caught	hold	of	us	,	and	caught	fire	,	and	it	would	be	 love 	 ly 	 	if	we	could	 re 	 produce 	 	that	 aga 	 in 	 	now	.
of	course	,	 re 	 fusing 	 	to	grow	up	--	--	even	 th 	 ough 	 	i	 imperson 	 ate 	 	a	grown	-	up	in	 dai 	 ly 	 	life	,	but	i	do	a	 fair 	 ly 	 	good	job	of	that	--	but	 re 	 ally 	 	 retain 	 ing 	 	that	 child 	 like 	 	quality	of	not	 car 	 ing 	 	what	other	people	think	about	what	you	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	,	is	 re 	 ally 	 	critical	.
the	next	element	is	the	fact	that	i	have	 appli 	 ed 	 	a	value	judgment	and	my	value	judgment	is	that	the	presence	of	life	is	better	than	no	life	.
and	so	,	life	is	more	 valu 	 able 	 	than	no	life	.
and	so	i	think	that	that	 hold 	 s 	 	together	a	great	deal	of	the	work	that	people	in	 th 	 is 	 	audience	approach	.
i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	mars	,	of	course	,	and	that	was	a	product	of	my	 be 	 ing 	 	a	young	 under 	 graduate 	 	when	the	viking	 land 	 ers 	 	 land 	 ed 	 	on	mars	.
and	that	took	what	had	 be 	 en 	 	a	 tin 	 y 	 	little	astronomical	object	in	the	sky	,	that	you	would	see	 a 	 s 	 	a	dot	,	and	 turn 	 ed 	 	it	 complete 	 ly 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	that	 ver 	 y 	 	first	primitive	picture	came	 ra 	 ster 	 ing 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	screen	.
and	when	it	 be 	 came 	 	a	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	,	it	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 came 	 	a	destination	,	and	 alter 	 ed 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	the	course	of	my	life	.
in	my	graduate	 year 	 s 	 	i	 work 	 ed 	 	with	my	 col 	 league 	 	and	mentor	and	friend	,	steve	schneider	,	at	the	national	center	for	 at 	 mo 	 spheric 	 	research	,	 work 	 ing 	 	on	global	change	 issue 	 s 	 	.
we	've	written	a	number	of	 thing 	 s 	 	on	the	role	of	gaia	 hypo 	 thesis 	 	--	 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	you	could	consider	earth	 a 	 s 	 	a	single	 ent 	 ity 	 	in	any	 meaning 	 ful 	 	scientific	sense	,	and	then	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	 out 	 growth 	 	of	that	,	i	 work 	 ed 	 	on	the	 environment 	 al 	 	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	of	nuclear	war	.
so	,	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	and	grim	 thing 	 s 	 	.
but	what	it	taught	me	was	to	look	at	earth	 a 	 s 	 	a	planet	with	external	 eye 	 s 	 	,	not	just	 a 	 s 	 	our	home	.
and	that	is	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 step 	 ping 	 	away	in	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	to	try	to	then	think	about	the	way	our	planet	 behav 	 es 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	planet	,	and	with	the	life	that	's	on	it	.
and	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	to	be	a	 s 	 al 	 ient 	 	point	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
we	're	 get 	 ting 	 	ready	to	begin	to	go	through	the	process	of	 leav 	 ing 	 	our	planet	of	origin	and	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	 wide 	 r 	 	solar	system	and	beyond	.
so	,	back	to	mars	.
how	hard	is	it	going	to	be	to	find	life	on	mars	?
well	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	for	us	to	find	each	other	,	even	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	.
so	,	 find 	 ing 	 	life	on	 an 	 other 	 	planet	is	a	non	-	trivial	occupation	and	we	 s 	 pend 	 	a	lot	of	time	 try 	 ing 	 	to	think	about	that	.
 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	you	think	it	's	 like 	 ly 	 	to	be	 success 	 ful 	 	sort	of	 depend 	 s 	 	on	what	you	think	about	the	 chance 	 s 	 	of	life	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
i	think	,	 my 	 self 	 	,	that	life	is	a	natural	 out 	 growth 	 	of	the	increasing	 complex 	 ification 	 	of	matter	over	time	.
so	,	you	start	with	the	big	bang	and	you	get	hydrogen	,	and	then	you	get	 hel 	 ium 	 	,	and	then	you	get	more	 complic 	 ated 	 	stuff	,	and	you	get	 planet 	 s 	 	 form 	 ing 	 	--	and	life	is	a	common	,	planetary	-	based	 phenomen 	 on 	 	,	in	my	view	.
 certain 	 ly 	 	,	in	the	last	15	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	increasing	 number 	 s 	 	of	 planet 	 s 	 	 out 	 side 	 	of	our	solar	system	 be 	 ing 	 	 confirm 	 ed 	 	,
and	just	last	month	,	a	couple	of	 week 	 s 	 	ago	,	a	planet	in	the	 s 	 ize 	 	-	class	of	earth	 ha 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	found	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	news	.
so	,	my	first	bold	 predict 	 ion 	 	is	that	,	is	that	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	life	is	going	to	be	 every 	 where 	 	.
it	's	going	to	be	 every 	 where 	 	we	look	--	where	there	are	planetary	 system 	 s 	 	that	can	possibly	support	it	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	planetary	 system 	 s 	 	are	going	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	common	.
so	,	what	about	life	on	mars	?
well	,	if	 some 	 body 	 	had	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	about	a	dozen	 year 	 s 	 	ago	what	i	thought	the	 chance 	 s 	 	of	life	on	mars	would	be	,	i	would	've	 prob 	 ably 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	a	couple	of	percent	.
and	even	that	was	 consider 	 ed 	 	 out 	 rage 	 ous 	 	at	the	time	.
i	was	once	 sneer 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 introduc 	 ed 	 	by	a	 form 	 er 	 	nasa	official	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	 on 	 ly 	 	person	on	the	planet	who	still	thought	there	was	life	on	mars	.
of	course	,	that	official	is	now	dead	,	and	i	'm	not	,	so	there	's	a	certain	amount	of	 glor 	 y 	 	in	 out 	 living 	 	your	 advers 	 aries 	 	.
but	 thing 	 s 	 	have	 change 	 d 	 	 great 	 ly 	 	over	the	last	dozen	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	the	reason	that	they	have	 change 	 d 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	we	now	have	new	information	.
the	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 path 	 finder 	 	mission	that	went	in	'97	,	and	the	mer	 r 	 over 	 	 mission 	 s 	 	that	are	on	mars	 a 	 s 	 	we	speak	now	and	the	european	space	 age 	 ncy 	 	's	mars	express	,	 ha 	 s 	 	taught	us	a	number	of	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
there	is	sub	-	surface	ice	on	that	planet	.
and	so	where	there	is	water	,	there	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	high	chance	of	our	kind	of	life	.
there	's	 clear 	 ly 	 	 sediment 	 ary 	 	 rock 	 s 	 	all	over	the	place	--	one	of	the	 land 	 ers 	 	is	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	the	middle	of	an	ancient	 sea 	 bed 	 	,	and	there	are	these	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 structure 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 blue 	 berries 	 	,	which	are	these	little	,	 rock 	 y 	 	 con 	 cre 	 tions 	 	that	we	are	 bus 	 y 	 	making	 bio 	 logically 	 	in	my	lab	right	now	.
so	,	with	all	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	put	together	,	i	think	that	the	 chance 	 s 	 	of	life	are	much	 great 	 er 	 	than	i	would	've	ever	thought	.
i	think	that	the	chance	of	life	 hav 	 ing 	 	 arise 	 n 	 	on	mars	,	 some 	 time 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	past	,	is	 may 	 be 	 	one	in	four	to	 may 	 be 	 	even	half	and	half	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	bold	 state 	 ment 	 	.
i	think	it	's	there	,	and	i	think	we	need	to	go	look	for	it	,	and	i	think	it	's	 under 	 ground 	 	.
so	the	game	's	 a 	 foot 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	game	that	we	play	in	astro	-	biology	.
how	do	you	try	to	get	a	handle	on	 extra 	 terrestrial 	 	life	?
how	do	you	plan	to	look	for	it	?
how	do	you	know	it	when	you	find	it	?
 be 	 cause 	 	if	it	's	big	and	obvious	,	we	would	've	 al 	 ready 	 	found	it	--	it	would	've	 al 	 ready 	 	bitten	us	on	the	foot	,	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	.
so	,	we	know	that	it	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 cry 	 p 	 tic 	 	.
 ver 	 y 	 	 critical 	 ly 	 	,	how	do	we	protect	it	,	if	we	find	it	,	and	not	 contami 	 n 	 ate 	 	it	?
and	 al 	 so 	 	,	even	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	more	 critical 	 ly 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	home	planet	we	have	,	how	do	we	protect	us	from	it	,	while	we	 stud 	 y 	 	it	?
so	why	might	it	be	hard	to	find	?
well	,	it	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	 micro 	 scopic 	 	,	and	it	's	never	easy	to	 stud 	 y 	 	 micro 	 scopic 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	the	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	that	we	now	have	to	do	that	allow	us	to	 stud 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	in	much	 great 	 er 	 	depth	,	at	much	 small 	 er 	 	 scale 	 s 	 	than	ever	before	.
but	it	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	 hid 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	are	out	 sequest 	 er 	 ing 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	from	your	environment	,	that	 make 	 s 	 	you	 y 	 um 	 my 	 	,	and	other	 thing 	 s 	 	might	want	to	eat	you	,	or	 consum 	 e 	 	you	.
and	so	,	there	's	a	game	of	predator	-	 pre 	 y 	 	that	's	going	to	be	,	 essential 	 ly 	 	,	universal	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	in	any	kind	of	 bio 	 logical 	 	system	.
it	 al 	 so 	 	may	be	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	different	in	 it 	 s 	 	fundamental	 proper 	 ties 	 	--	 it 	 s 	 	 chemist 	 ry 	 	,	or	 it 	 s 	 	 s 	 ize 	 	.
we	say	small	,	but	what	 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	?
is	it	virus	-	sized	?	is	it	 small 	 er 	 	than	that	?
is	it	 big 	 ger 	 	than	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 bacter 	 ium 	 	?	we	do	n't	know	.
and	speed	of	activity	,	which	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	face	in	our	work	with	sub	-	surface	 organism 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	grow	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	.
if	i	 we 	 re 	 	to	take	a	swab	off	your	 tee 	 th 	 	and	plate	it	on	a	 pe 	 tri 	 	plate	,	 with 	 in 	 	about	four	or	five	 hour 	 s 	 	,	i	would	have	to	see	growth	.
but	the	 organism 	 s 	 	that	we	work	with	,	from	the	sub	-	surface	of	earth	,	 ver 	 y 	 	often	it	's	 month 	 s 	 	--	and	in	 man 	 y 	 	 case 	 s 	 	,	 year 	 s 	 	--	before	we	see	any	growth	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	.
so	they	are	,	 intrinsic 	 ally 	 	,	a	 s 	 lower 	 	life	-	form	.
but	the	real	issue	is	that	we	are	 guide 	 d 	 	by	our	 limit 	 ed 	 	experience	,	and	 un 	 til 	 	we	can	think	out	of	the	box	of	our	 cr 	 an 	 ium 	 	and	what	we	know	,	then	we	ca	n't	 recogn 	 ize 	 	what	to	look	for	,	or	how	to	plan	for	it	.
so	,	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	is	 every 	 thing 	 	and	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	that	i	've	just	 brief 	 ly 	 	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	you	about	,	i	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	to	think	about	earth	 a 	 s 	 	an	 extra 	 terrestrial 	 	planet	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 in 	 valu 	 able 	 	in	our	approach	to	try	to	 stud 	 y 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	game	on	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	:	where	you	're	in	an	 air 	 plane 	 	and	you	look	out	the	window	,	you	see	the	horizon	.
i	 al 	 ways 	 	turn	my	head	on	the	side	,	and	that	simple	change	 make 	 s 	 	me	go	from	 see 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	planet	 a 	 s 	 	home	,	to	 see 	 ing 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	planet	.
it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	trick	,	and	i	never	fail	to	do	it	when	i	'm	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	a	window	seat	.
well	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	 app 	 ly 	 	to	our	work	.
 th 	 is 	 	 show 	 s 	 	one	of	the	most	 extrem 	 e 	 	 cave 	 s 	 	that	we	work	in	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	cueva	de	villa	luz	in	tabasco	,	in	mexico	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	cave	is	 saturate 	 d 	 	with	 sulfur 	 ic 	 	acid	.
there	is	tremendous	 amount 	 s 	 	of	hydrogen	sulfide	coming	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	cave	from	 volcan 	 ic 	 	 source 	 s 	 	and	from	the	 break 	 down 	 	of	 evapo 	 rite 	 	--	 mineral 	 s 	 	 be 	 low 	 	the	 carbon 	 ates 	 	in	which	 th 	 is 	 	cave	is	 form 	 ed 	 	--	and	it	is	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	 hostil 	 e 	 	environment	for	us	.
we	have	to	go	in	with	 protect 	 ive 	 	 suit 	 s 	 	and	 breath 	 ing 	 	gear	,	and	30	 part 	 s 	 	per	million	of	h	2s	will	kill	you	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 regular 	 ly 	 	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	hundred	 part 	 s 	 	per	million	.
so	,	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 hazard 	 ous 	 	environment	,	with	co	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	and	 man 	 y 	 	other	 gas 	 es 	 	.
these	 extrem 	 e 	 	physical	and	chemical	 parameter 	 s 	 	make	the	biology	that	 grow 	 s 	 	in	these	 place 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	special	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 contr 	 ary 	 	to	what	you	might	think	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 de 	 void 	 	of	life	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	 rich 	 est 	 	 cave 	 s 	 	that	we	have	found	on	the	planet	,	 any 	 where 	 	.
it	's	 burst 	 ing 	 	with	life	.
the	 extrem 	 es 	 	on	earth	are	 interest 	 ing 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	right	,	but	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	them	is	 be 	 cause 	 	they	represent	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	the	average	 condition 	 s 	 	that	we	may	expect	on	other	 planet 	 s 	 	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	part	of	the	ability	that	we	have	,	to	try	to	stretch	our	 imagin 	 ation 	 	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	what	we	may	find	in	the	future	.
there	's	so	much	life	in	 th 	 is 	 	cave	,	and	i	ca	n't	even	begin	to	scratch	the	surface	of	it	with	you	.
but	one	of	the	most	famous	 object 	 s 	 	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	are	what	we	call	snottites	,	for	obvious	 reason 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	stuff	 look 	 s 	 	like	what	 come 	 s 	 	out	of	your	two	-	year	-	old	's	nose	when	he	 ha 	 s 	 	a	cold	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 produce 	 d 	 	by	bacteria	who	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	making	more	 sulfur 	 ic 	 	acid	,	and	living	at	phs	right	around	zero	.
and	so	,	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	is	like	 batt 	 ery 	 	acid	.
and	yet	,	 every 	 thing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	cave	 ha 	 s 	 	 adapt 	 ed 	 	to	it	.
in	fact	,	there	's	so	much	energy	 avail 	 able 	 	for	biology	in	 th 	 is 	 	cave	,	that	there	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	huge	number	of	 cave 	 fish 	 	.
and	the	local	zoque	 in 	 d 	 ians 	 	harvest	 th 	 is 	 	twice	a	year	,	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	 the 	 ir 	 	easter	week	 celebr 	 ation 	 	and	holy	week	 celebr 	 ation 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 usual 	 	for	 cave 	 s 	 	.
in	some	of	the	other	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 cave 	 s 	 	that	we	work	in	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	in	lechuguilla	cave	in	new	mexico	near	carlsbad	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	most	famous	 cave 	 s 	 	in	the	world	.
it	's	115	 mile 	 s 	 	of	 ma 	 pped 	 	 pass 	 age 	 	,	it	's	 pr 	 ist 	 ine 	 	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	no	natural	 open 	 ing 	 	and	it	's	a	 gig 	 antic 	 	 bio 	 logical 	 	,	geo	-	microbiological	 labor 	 atory 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	cave	,	great	 area 	 s 	 	are	 cover 	 ed 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	 red 	 dish 	 	material	that	you	see	here	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	these	enormous	 crystal 	 s 	 	of	 s 	 ele 	 nite 	 	that	you	can	see	 dan 	 gling 	 	down	.
 th 	 is 	 	stuff	is	 produce 	 d 	 	 bio 	 logically 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 break 	 down 	 	product	of	the	 bed 	 rock 	 	,	that	 organism 	 s 	 	are	 bus 	 y 	 	 munch 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	way	through	.
they	take	iron	and	 man 	 gan 	 ese 	 	 mineral 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	 bed 	 rock 	 	and	they	 oxid 	 ize 	 	them	.
and	every	time	they	do	that	,	they	get	a	 tin 	 y 	 	little	 pack 	 et 	 	of	energy	.
and	that	 tin 	 y 	 	little	 pack 	 et 	 	of	energy	is	what	they	use	,	then	,	to	run	 the 	 ir 	 	life	 process 	 es 	 	.
 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	they	 al 	 so 	 	do	 th 	 is 	 	with	 ur 	 an 	 ium 	 	and	 chro 	 mium 	 	,	and	 vari 	 ous 	 	other	toxic	 metal 	 s 	 	.
and	so	,	the	obvious	 a 	 venue 	 	for	bio	-	 remedi 	 ation 	 	 come 	 s 	 	from	 organism 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
these	 organism 	 s 	 	we	now	 br 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	lab	,	and	you	can	see	some	of	them	growing	on	 pe 	 tri 	 	 plate 	 s 	 	,	and	get	them	to	 re 	 produce 	 	the	precise	 bio 	 mineral 	 s 	 	that	we	find	on	the	 wall 	 s 	 	of	these	 cave 	 s 	 	.
so	,	these	are	 signal 	 s 	 	that	they	 leav 	 e 	 	in	the	rock	record	.
well	,	even	in	basalt	 surface 	 s 	 	in	lava	-	tube	 cave 	 s 	 	,	which	are	a	by	-	product	of	 volcan 	 ic 	 	activity	,	we	find	these	 wall 	 s 	 	 total 	 ly 	 	 cover 	 ed 	 	,	in	 man 	 y 	 	 case 	 s 	 	,	by	these	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	 g 	 listen 	 ing 	 	silver	 wall 	 s 	 	,	or	 shin 	 y 	 	pink	or	 shin 	 y 	 	red	or	 shin 	 y 	 	gold	.
and	these	are	mineral	 deposit 	 s 	 	that	are	 al 	 so 	 	made	by	bacteria	.
and	you	can	see	in	these	central	 image 	 s 	 	here	,	 s 	 canning 	 	electron	 micro 	 graph 	 s 	 	of	some	of	these	 guy 	 s 	 	--	these	are	 garden 	 s 	 	of	these	bacteria	.
one	of	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	about	these	 part 	 icular 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	is	that	they	're	in	the	 act 	 ino 	 mycete 	 	and	 strepto 	 mycete 	 	 group 	 s 	 	of	the	bacteria	,	which	is	where	we	get	most	of	our	 anti 	 biotic 	 s 	 	.
the	sub	-	surface	of	earth	 contain 	 s 	 	a	vast	 bio 	 divers 	 ity 	 	.
and	these	 organism 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 separat 	 e 	 	from	the	surface	,	make	a	vast	array	of	novel	 com 	 pound 	 s 	 	.
and	so	,	the	potential	for	 exploit 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	for	pharmaceutical	and	industrial	chemical	uses	is	 complete 	 ly 	 	 un 	 ta 	 pped 	 	,	but	 prob 	 ably 	 	 exceed 	 s 	 	most	of	the	rest	of	the	 bio 	 divers 	 ity 	 	of	the	planet	.
so	,	lava	-	tube	 cave 	 s 	 	--	i	've	just	told	you	about	 organism 	 s 	 	that	live	here	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	.
we	know	that	on	mars	and	the	moon	there	are	 ton 	 s 	 	of	these	 structure 	 s 	 	.
we	can	see	them	.
on	the	left	you	can	see	a	lava	tube	 form 	 ing 	 	at	a	 re 	 cent 	 	 erupt 	 ion 	 	--	mount	etna	in	sicily	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	way	these	 tube 	 s 	 	form	.
and	when	they	hollow	out	,	then	they	 be 	 come 	 	 habit 	 at 	 s 	 	for	 organism 	 s 	 	.
these	are	all	over	the	planet	mars	,	and	we	're	 bus 	 y 	 	 catalog 	 u 	 ing 	 	them	now	.
and	so	,	there	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	cave	real	 e 	 state 	 	on	mars	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	of	that	type	.
in	order	to	access	these	sub	-	surface	 environment 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	,	we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 develop 	 ing 	 	the	 tool 	 s 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
you	know	,	it	's	not	easy	to	get	 in 	 to 	 	these	 cave 	 s 	 	.	it	 requir 	 es 	 	 crawl 	 ing 	 	,	 climb 	 ing 	 	,	rope	-	work	,	technical	rope	-	work	and	 man 	 y 	 	other	complex	human	 motion 	 s 	 	in	order	to	access	these	.
we	face	the	problem	of	,	how	can	we	do	 th 	 is 	 	 robotic 	 ally 	 	?
why	would	we	want	to	do	it	 robotic 	 ally 	 	?
well	,	we	're	going	to	be	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	robotic	 mission 	 s 	 	to	mars	long	in	advance	of	human	 mission 	 s 	 	.
and	then	,	 second 	 ly 	 	,	 get 	 ting 	 	back	to	that	 ear 	 lier 	 	point	that	i	made	about	the	 precious 	 ness 	 	of	any	life	that	we	may	find	on	mars	,	we	do	n't	want	to	 contami 	 n 	 ate 	 	it	.
and	one	of	the	best	ways	to	 stud 	 y 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 contami 	 nating 	 	it	is	to	have	an	 inter 	 media 	 ry 	 	.
and	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	we	're	 imagin 	 ing 	 	 inter 	 media 	 ry 	 	robotic	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	that	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	some	of	that	front	-	end	work	for	us	,	to	protect	any	potential	life	that	we	find	.
i	'm	not	going	to	go	through	all	of	these	 project 	 s 	 	now	,	but	we	're	 involve 	 d 	 	in	about	half	-	a	-	dozen	robotic	 develop 	 ment 	 	 project 	 s 	 	,	in	 collabor 	 ation 	 	with	a	number	of	different	 group 	 s 	 	.
i	want	to	talk	 specific 	 ally 	 	about	the	array	that	you	see	on	the	top	.
these	are	 hop 	 ping 	 	 micro 	 bot 	 	 s 	 warm 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	with	the	field	and	space	 robotic 	 s 	 	 labor 	 atory 	 	and	my	friend	steve	dubowsky	at	mit	,	and	we	have	come	up	with	the	idea	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	little	,	 jump 	 ing 	 	bean	-	like	 robot 	 s 	 	that	are	 propel 	 led 	 	by	artificial	muscle	,	which	is	one	of	the	dubowsky	lab	's	 special 	 ties 	 	--	are	the	epams	,	or	artificial	 muscle 	 s 	 	.
and	these	allow	them	to	hop	.
they	 behav 	 e 	 	with	a	 s 	 warm 	 	behavior	,	where	they	 re 	 late 	 	to	each	other	,	 model 	 ed 	 	after	insect	 s 	 warm 	 	behavior	,	and	they	could	be	made	 ver 	 y 	 	 nume 	 r 	 ous 	 	.
and	so	,	one	can	 s 	 end 	 	a	thousand	of	them	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	in	 th 	 is 	 	upper	left	-	hand	picture	,	a	thousand	of	them	could	fit	 in 	 to 	 	the	 pay 	 load 	 	 ba 	 y 	 	that	was	used	for	one	of	the	current	mer	 r 	 over 	 s 	 	.
and	these	little	 guy 	 s 	 	--	you	could	lose	 man 	 y 	 	of	them	.
if	you	 s 	 end 	 	a	thousand	of	them	,	you	could	 prob 	 ably 	 	get	rid	of	90	percent	of	them	and	still	have	a	mission	.
and	so	,	that	 allow 	 s 	 	you	the	 flex 	 ibility 	 	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 challeng 	 ing 	 	 terra 	 in 	 	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	make	your	way	where	you	want	to	go	.
now	,	to	wrap	 th 	 is 	 	up	,	i	want	to	talk	for	two	 second 	 s 	 	about	 cave 	 s 	 	and	the	human	expansion	beyond	earth	 a 	 s 	 	a	natural	 out 	 growth 	 	of	the	work	that	we	do	in	 cave 	 s 	 	.
it	 occur 	 red 	 	to	us	a	number	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	that	 cave 	 s 	 	have	 man 	 y 	 	 proper 	 ties 	 	that	people	have	used	and	other	 organism 	 s 	 	have	used	 a 	 s 	 	 habit 	 at 	 	in	the	past	.
and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	it	's	time	we	 start 	 ed 	 	to	explore	 t 	 hose 	 	,	in	the	 con 	 text 	 	of	future	mars	and	the	moon	exploration	.
so	,	we	have	just	 finish 	 ed 	 	a	nasa	institute	for	 advance 	 d 	 	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	phase	ii	 stud 	 y 	 	,	looking	at	the	 irreducib 	 le 	 	set	of	 techno 	 logies 	 	that	you	would	need	in	order	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	allow	people	to	inhabit	lava	 tube 	 s 	 	on	the	moon	or	mars	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	be	a	 fair 	 ly 	 	simple	and	small	list	,	and	we	have	gone	in	the	 relat 	 ively 	 	primitive	technology	direction	.
so	,	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 infla 	 table 	 	 liner 	 s 	 	that	can	conform	to	the	complex	 topo 	 logical 	 	shape	on	the	 in 	 side 	 	of	a	cave	,	 foam 	 ed 	 	-	in	-	place	 air 	 lock 	 s 	 	to	deal	with	 th 	 is 	 	complex	 top 	 ology 	 	,	 vari 	 ous 	 	ways	of	 get 	 ting 	 	 breath 	 ing 	 	 gas 	 es 	 	made	from	the	intrinsic	 material 	 s 	 	of	these	bodies	.
and	the	future	is	there	for	us	to	use	these	lava	-	tube	 cave 	 s 	 	on	mars	.
and	right	now	we	're	in	 cave 	 s 	 	,	and	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	science	and	 re 	 creation 	 	,	but	i	think	in	the	future	we	'll	be	using	them	for	 habit 	 at 	 	and	science	on	these	other	bodies	.
now	,	my	view	of	what	the	current	 stat 	 us 	 	of	potential	life	on	mars	is	that	it	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	 be 	 en 	 	on	the	planet	,	 may 	 be 	 	one	in	two	 chance 	 s 	 	.
the	question	 a 	 s 	 	to	 whet 	 her 	 	there	is	life	on	mars	that	is	related	to	life	on	earth	 ha 	 s 	 	now	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 mud 	 di 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	now	know	,	from	mars	 meteorite 	 s 	 	that	have	made	it	to	earth	,	that	there	's	material	that	can	be	 ex 	 change 	 d 	 	between	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 planet 	 s 	 	.
one	of	the	 burn 	 ing 	 	 question 	 s 	 	,	of	course	,	is	if	we	go	there	and	find	life	in	the	sub	-	surface	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	fully	expect	that	we	will	,	is	that	a	second	genesis	of	life	?
did	life	start	here	and	was	it	 transport 	 ed 	 	there	?
did	it	start	there	and	get	 transport 	 ed 	 	here	?
 th 	 is 	 	will	be	a	 fasci 	 nating 	 	 puzzl 	 e 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	next	half	-	century	,	and	where	i	expect	that	we	will	have	more	and	more	mars	 mission 	 s 	 	to	answer	these	 question 	 s 	 	.
thank	you	.
