i	want	to	start	with	a	game	.
and	to	win	 th 	 is 	 	game	,	all	you	have	to	do	is	see	the	 re 	 ality 	 	that	's	in	front	of	you	 a 	 s 	 	it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	.	all	right	?
so	,	we	have	two	 pan 	 el 	 s 	 	here	,	of	 color 	 ed 	 	 dot 	 s 	 	.
and	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 dot 	 s 	 	is	the	same	in	the	two	 pan 	 el 	 s 	 	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
and	you	have	to	tell	me	which	one	.
now	,	narrow	it	down	to	the	gray	one	,	the	green	one	and	,	say	,	the	 o 	 range 	 	one	.
so	,	by	a	show	of	 hand 	 s 	 	--	we	'll	start	with	the	 eas 	 iest 	 	one	--	show	of	 hand 	 s 	 	:	how	 man 	 y 	 	people	think	it	's	the	gray	one	?
 re 	 ally 	 	?	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	people	think	it	's	the	green	one	?
and	how	 man 	 y 	 	people	think	it	's	the	 o 	 range 	 	one	?
 pre 	 tty 	 	even	split	.
let	's	find	out	what	the	 re 	 ality 	 	is	.
here	is	the	 o 	 range 	 	one	.
here	is	the	green	one	.
and	here	is	the	gray	one	.
so	,	for	all	of	you	who	saw	that	,	you	're	a	complete	 re 	 alist 	 	.	all	right	?
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	is	n't	it	?
 be 	 cause 	 	 near 	 ly 	 	every	living	system	 ha 	 s 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	the	ability	to	detect	light	in	one	way	or	 an 	 other 	 	.
so	,	for	us	,	 see 	 ing 	 	color	is	one	of	the	 simpl 	 est 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	the	brain	 do 	 es 	 	.
and	yet	,	even	at	 th 	 is 	 	most	fundamental	level	,	 con 	 text 	 	is	 every 	 thing 	 	.
what	i	want	to	talk	about	is	not	that	 con 	 text 	 	is	 every 	 thing 	 	,	but	why	is	 con 	 text 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 answer 	 ing 	 	that	question	that	 tell 	 s 	 	us	not	 on 	 ly 	 	why	we	see	what	we	do	,	but	who	we	are	 a 	 s 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	,	and	who	we	are	 a 	 s 	 	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
but	first	,	we	have	to	ask	 an 	 other 	 	question	,	which	is	,	``	what	is	color	for	?	``
and	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	,	i	'll	just	show	you	.
what	you	see	here	is	a	jungle	scene	,
and	you	see	the	 surface 	 s 	 	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	the	amount	of	light	that	 t 	 hose 	 	 surface 	 s 	 	reflect	.
now	,	can	any	of	you	see	the	predator	that	's	about	to	jump	out	at	you	?
and	if	you	have	n't	 s 	 een 	 	it	yet	,	you	're	dead	.	right	?
can	 any 	 one 	 	see	it	?	 any 	 one 	 	?	no	?
now	,	let	's	see	the	 surface 	 s 	 	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	the	quality	of	light	that	they	reflect	.
and	now	you	see	it	.
so	,	color	 en 	 able 	 s 	 	us	to	see	the	 similar 	 ities 	 	and	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	between	 surface 	 s 	 	,	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	the	full	spectrum	of	light	that	they	reflect	.
but	what	you	've	just	 d 	 one 	 	is	,	in	 man 	 y 	 	 respect 	 s 	 	,	 mathematic 	 ally 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	.
why	?	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	berkeley	 tell 	 s 	 	us	,	we	have	no	direct	access	to	our	physical	world	,	other	than	through	our	 sense 	 s 	 	.
and	the	light	that	 fall 	 s 	 	onto	our	 eye 	 s 	 	is	 determine 	 d 	 	by	 multi 	 ple 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	in	the	world	--	not	 on 	 ly 	 	the	color	of	 object 	 s 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	the	color	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 illumi 	 nation 	 	,	and	the	color	of	the	space	between	us	and	 t 	 hose 	 	 object 	 s 	 	.
you	vary	any	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 parameter 	 s 	 	,	and	you	'll	change	the	color	of	the	light	that	 fall 	 s 	 	onto	your	eye	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	huge	problem	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	the	same	image	could	have	an	infinite	number	of	possible	real	-	world	 source 	 s 	 	.
so	let	me	show	you	what	i	mean	.	imagine	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	back	of	your	eye	.
and	these	are	two	 project 	 ions 	 	from	the	world	.
they	are	 ident 	 ical 	 	in	every	single	way	.
 ident 	 ical 	 	in	shape	,	 s 	 ize 	 	,	spectral	content	.	they	are	the	same	,	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	your	eye	is	 concern 	 ed 	 	.
and	yet	they	come	from	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	 source 	 s 	 	.
the	one	on	the	right	 come 	 s 	 	from	a	yellow	surface	,	in	shadow	,	oriented	facing	the	left	,	 view 	 ed 	 	through	a	 pink 	 ish 	 	medium	.
the	one	on	the	left	 come 	 s 	 	from	an	 o 	 range 	 	surface	,	under	direct	light	,	facing	to	the	right	,	 view 	 ed 	 	through	a	sort	of	a	 blu 	 ish 	 	medium	.
 complete 	 ly 	 	different	 meaning 	 s 	 	,	giving	rise	to	the	exact	same	 retina 	 l 	 	information	.
and	yet	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	the	 retina 	 l 	 	information	that	we	get	.
so	how	on	earth	do	we	even	see	?
so	,	if	you	remember	 any 	 thing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	next	18	 minute 	 s 	 	,	remember	 th 	 is 	 	:	that	the	light	that	 fall 	 s 	 	on	to	your	eye	,	 sensor 	 y 	 	information	,	is	 meaning 	 less 	 	,
 be 	 cause 	 	it	could	mean	 liter 	 ally 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	.
and	what	's	true	for	 sensor 	 y 	 	information	is	true	for	information	 general 	 ly 	 	.
there	is	no	inherent	meaning	in	information	.
it	's	what	we	do	with	that	information	that	 matter 	 s 	 	.
so	,	how	do	we	see	?	well	,	we	see	by	 learn 	 ing 	 	to	see	.
so	,	the	brain	 evolv 	 ed 	 	the	 mechan 	 ism 	 s 	 	for	 find 	 ing 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	,	 find 	 ing 	 	 relationship 	 s 	 	in	information	and	 associ 	 ating 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 relationship 	 s 	 	with	a	 behavior 	 al 	 	meaning	,	a	 sign 	 ific 	 ance 	 	,	by	 interact 	 ing 	 	with	the	world	.
we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	aware	of	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	form	of	more	cognitive	 attribut 	 es 	 	,	like	language	.
so	,	i	'm	going	to	give	you	some	letter	 string 	 s 	 	.	and	i	want	you	to	read	them	out	for	me	,	if	you	can	.
audience	:	``	can	you	read	 th 	 is 	 	?	``
``	you	are	not	 read 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.	``
``	what	are	you	 read 	 ing 	 	?	``
beau	 lot 	 to 	 	:	``	what	are	you	 read 	 ing 	 	?	``	half	the	 letter 	 s 	 	are	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	.	right	?
there	is	no	a	priori	reason	why	an	``	h	``	 ha 	 s 	 	to	go	between	that	``	w	``	and	``	a.	``
but	you	put	one	there	.	why	?
 be 	 cause 	 	in	the	 statistic 	 s 	 	of	your	past	experience	it	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	to	do	so	.	so	you	do	so	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	yet	you	do	n't	put	a	letter	after	that	first	``	t.	``
why	?	 be 	 cause 	 	it	would	n't	have	 be 	 en 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	in	the	past	.
so	you	do	n't	do	it	 aga 	 in 	 	.
so	let	me	show	you	how	 quick 	 ly 	 	our	 brain 	 s 	 	can	 re 	 define 	 	 normal 	 ity 	 	,
even	at	the	 simpl 	 est 	 	thing	the	brain	 do 	 es 	 	,	which	is	color	.
so	,	if	i	could	have	the	 light 	 s 	 	down	up	here	.
i	want	you	to	first	notice	that	 t 	 hose 	 	two	desert	 scene 	 s 	 	are	 physical 	 ly 	 	the	same	.
one	is	 simpl 	 y 	 	the	 flip 	 ping 	 	of	the	other	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
now	i	want	you	to	look	at	that	dot	between	the	green	and	the	red	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
and	i	want	you	to	 star 	 e 	 	at	that	dot	.	do	n't	look	 any 	 where 	 	else	.
and	we	're	going	to	look	at	that	for	about	30	 second 	 s 	 	,
which	is	a	bit	of	a	killer	in	an	18	-	minute	talk	.
but	i	 re 	 ally 	 	want	you	to	learn	.
and	i	'll	tell	you	--	do	n't	look	 any 	 where 	 	else	--	and	i	'll	tell	you	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	 in 	 side 	 	your	head	.
your	brain	is	 learn 	 ing 	 	.	and	it	's	 learn 	 ing 	 	that	the	right	side	of	 it 	 s 	 	visual	field	is	under	red	 illumi 	 nation 	 	;	the	left	side	of	 it 	 s 	 	visual	field	is	under	green	 illumi 	 nation 	 	.
that	's	what	it	's	 learn 	 ing 	 	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
now	,	when	i	tell	you	,	i	want	you	to	look	at	the	dot	between	the	two	desert	 scene 	 s 	 	.
so	why	do	n't	you	do	that	now	?
can	i	have	the	 light 	 s 	 	up	 aga 	 in 	 	?
i	take	it	from	your	 respons 	 e 	 	they	do	n't	look	the	same	 any 	 more 	 	.	right	?
why	?	 be 	 cause 	 	your	brain	is	 see 	 ing 	 	that	same	information	 a 	 s 	 	if	the	right	one	is	still	under	red	light	,	and	the	left	one	is	still	under	green	light	.
that	's	your	new	normal	.
so	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	mean	for	 con 	 text 	 	?
it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	i	can	take	these	two	 ident 	 ical 	 	 square 	 s 	 	,	and	i	can	put	them	in	light	and	dark	 surround 	 s 	 	.
and	now	the	one	on	the	dark	surround	 look 	 s 	 	 light 	 er 	 	than	the	one	on	the	light	surround	.
what	's	significant	is	not	 simpl 	 y 	 	the	light	and	dark	 surround 	 s 	 	that	matter	.
it	's	what	 t 	 hose 	 	light	and	dark	 surround 	 s 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	for	your	behavior	in	the	past	.
so	i	'll	show	you	what	i	mean	.	here	we	have	that	exact	same	illusion	.
we	have	two	 ident 	 ical 	 	 tile 	 s 	 	,	on	the	left	,	one	in	a	dark	surround	,	one	in	a	light	surround	.
and	the	same	thing	over	on	the	right	.
now	,	what	i	'm	going	to	do	is	i	'm	going	to	review	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 scene 	 s 	 	.
but	i	'm	not	going	to	change	 any 	 thing 	 	 with 	 in 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	boxes	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	meaning	.
and	see	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	your	 per 	 ception 	 	.
notice	that	on	the	left	the	two	 tile 	 s 	 	look	 near 	 ly 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	 oppos 	 ite 	 	:	one	 ver 	 y 	 	white	and	one	 ver 	 y 	 	dark	.
all	right	?	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	on	the	right	,	the	two	 tile 	 s 	 	look	 near 	 ly 	 	the	same	.
and	yet	there	is	still	one	on	a	dark	surround	and	one	on	a	light	surround	.
why	?	 be 	 cause 	 	if	the	tile	in	that	shadow	 we 	 re 	 	in	fact	in	shadow	,	and	 reflect 	 ing 	 	the	same	amount	of	light	to	your	eye	 a 	 s 	 	the	one	 out 	 side 	 	the	shadow	,	it	would	have	to	be	more	 reflect 	 ive 	 	--	just	the	 law 	 s 	 	of	physics	.
so	you	see	it	that	way	.
 where 	 a 	 s 	 	on	the	right	,	the	information	is	 consist 	 ent 	 	with	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 tile 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	under	the	same	light	.
if	they	are	under	the	same	light	,	 reflect 	 ing 	 	the	same	amount	of	light	to	your	eye	,	then	they	must	be	 equal 	 ly 	 	 reflect 	 ive 	 	.
so	you	see	it	that	way	.
which	 mean 	 s 	 	we	can	 br 	 ing 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	information	together	to	create	some	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	strong	 illusion 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	i	made	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	you	'll	notice	you	see	a	dark	 brow 	 n 	 	tile	at	the	top	,	and	a	bright	 o 	 range 	 	tile	at	the	side	.
that	is	your	 per 	 cept 	 ual 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	.	the	physical	 re 	 ality 	 	is	that	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 tile 	 s 	 	are	the	same	.
here	you	see	four	gray	 tile 	 s 	 	on	your	left	,	seven	gray	 tile 	 s 	 	on	the	right	.
i	'm	not	going	to	change	 t 	 hose 	 	 tile 	 s 	 	at	all	,
but	i	'm	going	to	reveal	the	rest	of	the	scene
and	see	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	your	 per 	 ception 	 	.
the	four	blue	 tile 	 s 	 	on	the	left	are	gray	.
the	seven	yellow	 tile 	 s 	 	on	the	right	are	 al 	 so 	 	gray	.
they	are	the	same	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	me	?	let	's	watch	it	 aga 	 in 	 	.
what	's	true	for	color	is	 al 	 so 	 	true	for	complex	 per 	 ception 	 s 	 	of	motion	.
so	here	we	have	--	let	's	turn	 th 	 is 	 	around	--	a	diamond	.
and	what	i	'm	going	to	do	is	,	i	'm	going	to	hold	it	here	,	and	i	'm	going	to	spin	it	.	and	for	all	of	you	,	you	'll	see	it	 prob 	 ably 	 	 s 	 pinning 	 	 th 	 is 	 	direction	.
now	i	want	you	to	keep	looking	at	it	.
move	your	 eye 	 s 	 	around	,	blink	,	 may 	 be 	 	close	one	eye	.
and	 sudden 	 ly 	 	it	will	flip	,	and	start	 s 	 pinning 	 	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	direction	.
 y 	 es 	 	?	raise	your	hand	if	you	got	that	.	 y 	 es 	 	?
keep	 blink 	 ing 	 	.	every	time	you	blink	it	will	 s 	 witch 	 	.	 al 	 right 	 	?
so	i	can	ask	you	,	which	direction	is	it	 rot 	 ating 	 	?
how	do	you	know	?
your	brain	 do 	 es 	 	n't	know	.	 be 	 cause 	 	both	are	 equal 	 ly 	 	 like 	 ly 	 	.
so	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	where	it	 look 	 s 	 	,	it	 flip 	 s 	 	between	the	two	 possibil 	 ities 	 	.
are	we	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 one 	 s 	 	that	see	 illusion 	 s 	 	?
the	answer	to	 th 	 is 	 	question	is	no	.
even	the	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 bumble 	 bee 	 	,	with	 it 	 s 	 	mere	one	million	brain	 cell 	 s 	 	,	which	is	250	 time 	 s 	 	 few 	 er 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	than	you	have	in	one	retina	,	 s 	 ees 	 	 illusion 	 s 	 	,	 do 	 es 	 	the	most	 complic 	 ated 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	even	our	most	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	ca	n't	do	.
so	in	my	lab	,	we	of	course	work	on	 bumble 	 bees 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	can	 complete 	 ly 	 	control	 the 	 ir 	 	experience	,	and	see	how	that	 alter 	 s 	 	the	 architect 	 ure 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	brain	.
and	we	do	 th 	 is 	 	in	what	we	call	the	bee	 m 	 atrix 	 	.
and	here	you	have	the	hive	.	you	can	see	the	 que 	 en 	 	bee	,	that	large	bee	in	the	middle	there	.	 t 	 hose 	 	are	all	her	 daughter 	 s 	 	,	the	 egg 	 s 	 	.
and	they	go	back	and	forth	between	 th 	 is 	 	hive	and	the	arena	,	via	 th 	 is 	 	tube	.
and	you	'll	see	one	of	the	bees	come	out	here	.
you	see	how	she	 ha 	 s 	 	a	little	number	on	her	?
 yea 	 h 	 	there	is	 an 	 other 	 	one	coming	out	.	she	 ha 	 s 	 	 an 	 other 	 	number	on	her	.
now	,	they	are	not	born	that	way	.	right	?
we	pull	them	out	,	put	them	in	the	 f 	 ridge 	 	,	and	they	fall	 a 	 sleep 	 	.
and	then	you	can	 super 	 glue 	 	little	 number 	 s 	 	on	them	.
and	now	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	experiment	they	get	 reward 	 ed 	 	if	they	go	to	the	blue	 flower 	 s 	 	.
and	they	land	on	the	flower	.	they	stick	 the 	 ir 	 	tongue	in	there	,	 call 	 ed 	 	a	 prob 	 os 	 cis 	 	,	and	they	drink	sugar	water	.
now	she	is	 drink 	 ing 	 	a	glass	of	water	that	's	about	that	big	to	you	and	i	,	will	do	that	about	three	 time 	 s 	 	,	and	then	fly	.
and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	they	learn	not	to	go	to	the	blue	,	but	to	go	to	where	the	other	bees	go	.
so	they	copy	each	other	.	they	can	count	to	five	.	they	can	 recogn 	 ize 	 	 face 	 s 	 	.
and	here	she	 come 	 s 	 	down	the	 lad 	 der 	 	.
and	she	'll	come	 in 	 to 	 	the	hive	,	find	an	empty	honey	pot	and	throw	up	,	and	that	's	honey	.
now	remember	--	--	she	's	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	going	to	the	blue	 flower 	 s 	 	.
but	what	are	these	bees	 do 	 ing 	 	in	the	upper	right	corner	?
it	 look 	 s 	 	like	they	're	going	to	green	 flower 	 s 	 	.
now	,	are	they	 get 	 ting 	 	it	wrong	?
and	the	answer	to	the	question	is	no	.	 t 	 hose 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	blue	 flower 	 s 	 	.
but	 t 	 hose 	 	are	blue	 flower 	 s 	 	under	green	light	.
so	they	are	using	the	 relationship 	 s 	 	between	the	 color 	 s 	 	to	solve	the	 puzzl 	 e 	 	,
which	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	we	do	.
so	,	 illusion 	 s 	 	are	often	used	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	in	art	,	in	the	 word 	 s 	 	of	a	more	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	artist	,	``	to	 demonst 	 rate 	 	the	 f 	 rag 	 ility 	 	of	our	 sense 	 s 	 	.	``
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	complete	 rub 	 b 	 ish 	 	.
the	 sense 	 s 	 	are	n't	fragile	.	and	if	they	 we 	 re 	 	,	we	would	n't	be	here	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	color	 tell 	 s 	 	us	 some 	 thing 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	,	that	the	brain	did	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	evolve	to	see	the	world	the	way	it	is	.
we	ca	n't	.	 in 	 stead 	 	,	the	brain	 evolv 	 ed 	 	to	see	the	world	the	way	it	was	 use 	 ful 	 	to	see	in	the	past	.
and	how	we	see	is	by	 continu 	 ally 	 	 re 	 defi 	 ning 	 	 normal 	 ity 	 	.
so	how	can	we	take	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	of	 plastic 	 ity 	 	of	the	brain	and	get	people	to	experience	 the 	 ir 	 	world	 different 	 ly 	 	?
well	,	one	of	the	ways	we	do	in	my	lab	and	studio	is	we	 transl 	 ate 	 	the	light	 in 	 to 	 	sound	and	we	 en 	 able 	 	people	to	hear	 the 	 ir 	 	visual	world	.
and	they	can	 navig 	 ate 	 	the	world	using	 the 	 ir 	 	 ear 	 s 	 	.
here	is	david	,	in	the	right	.	and	he	is	 hold 	 ing 	 	a	camera	.
on	the	left	is	what	his	camera	 s 	 ees 	 	.
and	you	'll	see	there	is	a	line	,	a	faint	line	going	 a 	 cross 	 	that	image	.
that	line	is	broken	up	 in 	 to 	 	32	 square 	 s 	 	.
in	each	square	we	 calcul 	 ate 	 	the	average	color	.
and	then	we	just	 simpl 	 y 	 	 transl 	 ate 	 	that	 in 	 to 	 	sound	.
and	now	he	's	going	to	turn	around	,	close	his	 eye 	 s 	 	,	and	find	a	plate	on	the	ground	with	his	 eye 	 s 	 	closed	.
he	 find 	 s 	 	it	.	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.	right	?
so	not	 on 	 ly 	 	can	we	create	a	 prost 	 hetic 	 	for	the	 visual 	 ly 	 	 impair 	 ed 	 	,	but	we	can	 al 	 so 	 	investigate	how	people	 liter 	 ally 	 	make	sense	of	the	world	.
but	we	can	 al 	 so 	 	do	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.	we	can	 al 	 so 	 	make	music	with	color	.
so	,	 work 	 ing 	 	with	 kid 	 s 	 	,	they	 create 	 d 	 	 image 	 s 	 	,	 think 	 ing 	 	about	what	might	the	 image 	 s 	 	you	see	sound	like	if	we	could	listen	to	them	.
and	then	we	 transl 	 ated 	 	these	 image 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 image 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	six	-	year	-	old	child	 com 	 posing 	 	a	piece	of	music	for	a	32	-	piece	orchestra	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	 sound 	 s 	 	like	.
so	,	a	six	-	year	-	old	child	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
now	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	mean	?
what	 th 	 is 	 	 suggest 	 s 	 	is	that	no	one	is	an	 out 	 side 	 	 observ 	 er 	 	of	nature	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
we	are	not	defined	by	our	central	 proper 	 ties 	 	,	by	the	bits	that	make	us	up	.
we	're	defined	by	our	environment	and	our	 interact 	 ion 	 	with	that	environment	--	by	our	 eco 	 logy 	 	.
and	that	 eco 	 logy 	 	is	 necess 	 arily 	 	 relat 	 ive 	 	,	 historic 	 al 	 	and	 empir 	 ical 	 	.
so	what	i	'd	like	to	finish	with	is	 th 	 is 	 	over	here	.
 be 	 cause 	 	what	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 celebr 	 ate 	 	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	 on 	 ly 	 	through	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	is	there	potential	for	 understand 	 ing 	 	.
so	,	if	some	of	you	are	still	 feel 	 ing 	 	a	bit	too	certain	,	i	'd	like	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
so	,	if	we	have	the	 light 	 s 	 	down	.
and	what	we	have	here	--	can	 every 	 one 	 	see	25	 pur 	 ple 	 	 surface 	 s 	 	on	your	left	,	and	25	,	call	it	 yellow 	 ish 	 	,	 surface 	 s 	 	on	your	right	?
so	,	now	,	what	i	want	to	do	:	i	'm	going	to	put	the	middle	nine	 surface 	 s 	 	here	under	yellow	 illumi 	 nation 	 	by	 simpl 	 y 	 	 put 	 ting 	 	a	filter	 be 	 hind 	 	them	.
all	right	.	now	you	can	see	that	 change 	 s 	 	the	light	that	's	coming	through	there	.	right	?
 be 	 cause 	 	now	the	light	is	going	through	a	 yellow 	 ish 	 	filter	and	then	a	 pur 	 pl 	 ish 	 	filter	.	i	'm	going	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	 oppos 	 ite 	 	on	the	left	here	.
i	'm	going	to	put	the	middle	nine	under	a	 pur 	 pl 	 ish 	 	light	.
now	,	some	of	you	will	notice	that	the	 con 	 sequence 	 	is	that	the	light	coming	through	 t 	 hose 	 	middle	nine	on	the	right	,	or	your	left	,	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	 a 	 s 	 	the	light	coming	through	the	middle	nine	on	your	right	.
 agree 	 d 	 	?	 y 	 es 	 	?
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	so	they	are	 physical 	 ly 	 	the	same	.
let	's	pull	the	 cover 	 s 	 	off	.
now	remember	,	you	know	the	middle	nine	are	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	.
do	they	look	the	same	?	no	.
the	question	is	,	``	is	that	an	illusion	?	``
and	i	'll	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	that	.
so	,	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
