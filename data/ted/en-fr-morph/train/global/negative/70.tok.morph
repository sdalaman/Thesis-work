 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	a	two	-	hour	 present 	 ation 	 	i	give	to	high	school	 student 	 s 	 	,	cut	down	to	three	 minute 	 s 	 	.	and	it	all	 start 	 ed 	 	one	day	on	a	plane	,	on	my	way	to	ted	,	seven	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	in	the	seat	next	to	me	was	a	high	school	student	,	a	teenager	,	and	she	came	from	a	 re 	 ally 	 	poor	family	.
and	she	 want 	 ed 	 	to	make	 some 	 thing 	 	of	her	life	,	and	she	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	a	simple	little	question	.
she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	 lead 	 s 	 	to	success	?	``	and	i	felt	 re 	 ally 	 	 bad 	 ly 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	could	n't	give	her	a	good	answer	.
so	i	get	off	the	plane	,	and	i	come	to	ted	.
and	i	think	,	jeez	,	i	'm	in	the	middle	of	a	room	of	 success 	 ful 	 	people	!
so	why	do	n't	i	ask	them	what	 help 	 ed 	 	them	succeed	,	and	pass	it	on	to	 kid 	 s 	 	?

ted	-	sters	do	it	for	love	;	they	do	n't	do	it	for	money	.
carol	coletta	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	would	pay	 some 	 one 	 	to	do	what	i	do	.	``
and	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	is	:	if	you	do	it	for	love	,	the	money	 come 	 s 	 	 any 	 way 	 	.
work	!	rupert	murdoch	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	``	it	's	all	hard	work	.

did	he	say	 f 	 un 	 	?	rupert	?	 y 	 es 	 	!
ted	-	sters	do	have	 f 	 un 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	.	and	they	work	hard	.
i	 figur 	 ed 	 	,	they	're	not	 work 	 aholic 	 s 	 	.	they	're	 work 	 afro 	 lic 	 s 	 	.
good	!	alex	garden	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	to	be	 success 	 ful 	 	put	your	nose	down	in	 some 	 thing 	 	and	get	damn	good	at	it	.	``
there	's	no	magic	;	it	's	practice	,	practice	,	practice	.
and	it	's	focus	.	norman	jewison	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	``	i	think	it	all	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	with	 focus 	 ing 	 	 your 	 self 	 	on	one	thing	.	``	and	push	!	david	gallo	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	push	 your 	 self 	 	.
 physical 	 ly 	 	,	 ment 	 ally 	 	,	you	've	got	ta	push	,	push	,	push	.	``
you	got	ta	push	through	 s 	 hy 	 ness 	 	and	self	-	doubt	.
goldie	hawn	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	 al 	 ways 	 	had	self	-	 doubt 	 s 	 	.
i	was	n't	good	 en 	 ough 	 	;	i	was	n't	smart	 en 	 ough 	 	.
i	did	n't	think	i	'd	make	it	.	``
now	it	's	not	 al 	 ways 	 	easy	to	push	 your 	 self 	 	,	and	that	's	why	they	 invent 	 ed 	 	 mother 	 s 	 	.

now	a	lot	of	 kid 	 s 	 	tell	me	they	want	to	be	 millionaire 	 s 	 	.
and	the	first	thing	i	say	to	them	is	:	``	ok	,	well	you	ca	n't	serve	 your 	 self 	 	;	you	got	ta	serve	 other 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	of	value	.

i	'd	say	it	was	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	idea	.
and	there	's	no	magic	to	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	in	coming	up	with	 idea 	 s 	 	--	it	's	just	 do 	 ing 	 	some	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 thing 	 s 	 	.

which	of	course	 mean 	 s 	 	``	 critic 	 ism 	 	,	 reject 	 ion 	 	,	 ass 	 hole 	 s 	 	and	pressure	.	``
so	,	the	big	--	the	answer	to	 th 	 is 	 	question	is	simple	:	pay	4,000	 buck 	 s 	 	and	come	to	ted	.
or	 fail 	 ing 	 	that	,	do	the	eight	 thing 	 s 	 	--	and	trust	me	,	these	are	the	big	eight	 thing 	 s 	 	that	lead	to	success	.
thank	you	ted	-	sters	for	all	your	 interview 	 s 	 	!
