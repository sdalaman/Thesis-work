so	,	what	i	'm	going	to	do	is	just	give	you	the	 lat 	 est 	 	episode	of	india	's	--	 may 	 be 	 	the	world	's	--	 long 	 est 	 	running	soap	opera	,	which	is	cricket	.
and	may	it	run	 fore 	 ver 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 give 	 s 	 	people	like	me	a	living	.
it	's	got	 every 	 thing 	 	that	you	'd	want	a	normal	soap	opera	to	want	:
it	's	got	love	,	joy	,	happiness	,	 s 	 ad 	 ness 	 	,	 tear 	 s 	 	,	laughter	,	 lot 	 s 	 	of	deceit	,	 intrigu 	 e 	 	.
and	like	all	good	soaps	,	it	 jump 	 s 	 	20	 year 	 s 	 	when	the	audience	interest	 change 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	cricket	 ha 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	.
it	's	 jump 	 ed 	 	20	 year 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	20	-	over	game	.
and	that	's	what	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	,	how	a	small	change	 lead 	 s 	 	to	a	 ver 	 y 	 	big	revolution	.
but	it	was	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	like	that	.
cricket	was	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	 th 	 is 	 	speed	-	driven	 generation 	 s 	 	game	.
there	was	a	time	when	you	 play 	 ed 	 	cricket	,	you	 play 	 ed 	 	 time 	 less 	 	test	 match 	 es 	 	,	when	you	 play 	 ed 	 	on	till	the	game	got	over	.
and	there	was	 th 	 is 	 	game	in	march	1939	that	 start 	 ed 	 	on	the	third	of	march	and	 end 	 ed 	 	on	the	14th	of	march	.
and	it	 on 	 ly 	 	 end 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	english	cricketers	had	to	go	from	durban	to	cape	town	,	which	is	a	two	-	hour	train	journey	,	to	catch	the	ship	that	left	on	the	17th	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	next	ship	was	n't	around	for	a	long	time	.
so	,	the	match	was	 end 	 ed 	 	in	between	.
and	one	of	the	english	batsmen	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	what	?
 an 	 other 	 	half	an	hour	and	we	would	have	won	.	``
 an 	 other 	 	half	an	hour	after	12	 day 	 s 	 	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	two	sundays	in	between	.	but	of	course	,	sundays	are	church	 day 	 s 	 	,
so	you	do	n't	play	on	sundays	.	and	one	day	it	 rain 	 ed 	 	,
so	they	all	 s 	 at 	 	around	making	 friend 	 s 	 	with	each	other	.
but	there	is	a	reason	why	india	fell	in	love	with	cricket	:	 be 	 cause 	 	we	had	about	the	same	pace	of	life	.
the	mahabharata	was	like	that	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	was	n't	it	?
you	 f 	 ought 	 	by	day	,	then	it	was	 s 	 un 	 set 	 	,	so	 every 	 one 	 	went	back	home	.
and	then	you	 work 	 ed 	 	out	your	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	,	and	you	came	and	 f 	 ought 	 	the	next	day	,	and	you	went	back	home	 aga 	 in 	 	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	the	mahabharata	and	our	cricket	was	that	in	cricket	,	 every 	 body 	 	was	 al 	 ive 	 	to	come	back	and	fight	the	next	day	.
 prince 	 s 	 	 patron 	 ize 	 	the	game	,	not	 be 	 cause 	 	they	love	the	game	,	but	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	a	 mean 	 s 	 	of	 ing 	 rati 	 ating 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	the	british	 rul 	 ers 	 	.
but	there	is	one	other	reason	why	india	fell	in	love	with	cricket	,	which	was	,	all	you	 need 	 ed 	 	was	a	plank	of	wood	and	a	rubber	ball	,	and	any	number	of	people	could	play	it	 any 	 where 	 	.
take	a	look	:
you	could	play	it	in	the	dump	with	some	 rock 	 s 	 	over	there	,
you	could	play	it	in	a	little	 al 	 ley 	 	--
you	could	n't	hit	square	 any 	 where 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	bat	hit	the	wall	;
do	n't	forget	the	air	 condition 	 ing 	 	and	the	cable	 wire 	 s 	 	.
you	could	play	it	on	the	 bank 	 s 	 	of	the	ganges	--
that	's	 a 	 s 	 	clean	 a 	 s 	 	the	ganges	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	for	a	long	time	.
or	you	could	play	 man 	 y 	 	 game 	 s 	 	in	one	small	patch	of	land	,	even	if	you	did	n't	know	which	game	you	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	in	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	you	can	play	 any 	 where 	 	.
but	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	the	game	 move 	 d 	 	on	,	you	know	,	 final 	 ly 	 	.
you	do	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	have	five	 day 	 s 	 	.	so	,	we	 move 	 d 	 	on	,	and	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	50	-	over	cricket	.
and	then	an	enormous	accident	took	place	.
in	indian	 s 	 port 	 	we	do	n't	make	 thing 	 s 	 	happen	,
 accident 	 s 	 	happen	and	we	're	in	the	right	place	at	the	right	time	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	.
and	we	won	 th 	 is 	 	world	cup	in	1983	.
and	 sudden 	 ly 	 	we	fell	in	love	with	the	50	-	over	game	,
and	we	 play 	 ed 	 	it	 virtual 	 ly 	 	every	day	.
there	was	more	50	-	over	cricket	than	 any 	 where 	 	.
but	there	was	 an 	 other 	 	big	date	.
1983	was	when	we	won	the	world	cup	.
1991	,	'92	,	we	found	a	finance	 mini 	 ster 	 	and	a	prime	 mini 	 ster 	 	 will 	 ing 	 	to	let	the	world	look	at	india	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	be	 th 	 is 	 	great	country	of	 intrigu 	 e 	 	and	 myster 	 y 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	closed	country	.
and	so	we	 allow 	 ed 	 	 multi 	 national 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	india	.
we	cut	 custom 	 s 	 	 du 	 ties 	 	,	we	 reduc 	 ed 	 	import	 du 	 ties 	 	,
and	we	got	all	the	 multi 	 national 	 s 	 	coming	in	,	with	 multi 	 national 	 	 budget 	 s 	 	,	who	 look 	 ed 	 	at	per	-	capita	income	and	got	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	the	 possibil 	 ities 	 	in	india	,	and	 we 	 re 	 	looking	for	a	vehicle	to	reach	every	indian	.
and	there	are	 on 	 ly 	 	two	 vehicle 	 s 	 	in	india	--	one	real	,	one	 script 	 ed 	 	.
the	 script 	 ed 	 	one	is	what	you	see	in	the	 movie 	 s 	 	,
the	real	one	was	cricket	.
and	so	one	of	my	 friend 	 s 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	right	here	in	front	of	me	,	ravi	dhariwal	from	pepsi	,	 decide 	 d 	 	he	's	going	to	take	it	all	over	the	world	.
and	pepsi	was	 th 	 is 	 	big	revolution	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 start 	 ed 	 	taking	cricket	all	over	.
and	so	cricket	 start 	 ed 	 	 be 	 coming 	 	big	;
cricket	 start 	 ed 	 	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	 rich 	 es 	 	in	.
 tele 	 vision 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	 cover 	 ing 	 	cricket	.	for	a	long	time	 tele 	 vision 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	wo	n't	cover	cricket	 un 	 less 	 	you	pay	us	to	cover	it	.	``
then	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	ok	,
the	next	 right 	 s 	 	are	 s 	 old 	 	for	55	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
the	next	 right 	 s 	 	are	 s 	 old 	 	for	612	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	.	``	so	,	it	's	a	bit	of	a	 curv 	 e 	 	,	that	.
and	then	 an 	 other 	 	big	accident	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	our	cricket	.
england	 invent 	 ed 	 	20	overs	cricket	,	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	the	world	must	play	20	overs	cricket	.	``
just	 a 	 s 	 	england	 invent 	 ed 	 	cricket	,	and	made	the	rest	of	the	world	play	it	.
thank	god	for	them	.
and	so	,	india	had	to	go	and	play	the	t	20	world	cup	,	you	see	.
india	did	n't	want	to	play	the	t	20	world	cup	.
but	we	 we 	 re 	 	 force 	 d 	 	to	play	it	by	an	8-1	margin	.
and	then	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 dramat 	 ic 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
we	got	to	the	final	,	and	then	 th 	 is 	 	moment	,	that	will	remain	 enshrin 	 ed 	 	 fore 	 ver 	 	,	for	 every 	 body 	 	,	take	a	look	.
the	pakistani	batsman	 try 	 ing 	 	to	clear	the	fielder	.
announcer	:	and	zishan	 take 	 s 	 	it	!	india	 win 	 s 	 	!
what	a	match	for	a	twenty20	final	.
india	,	the	world	 champion 	 s 	 	.
india	,	t	20	 champion 	 s 	 	.
but	what	a	game	we	had	,	m.	s.	dhoni	got	it	right	in	the	air	,	but	misbah	-	ul	-	haq	,	what	a	player	.
a	massive	,	massive	success	:
india	,	the	world	tt	 champion 	 s 	 	.
harsha	bhogle	:	 sudden 	 ly 	 	india	 discover 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	power	of	20	-	overs	cricket	.
the	accident	,	of	course	,	there	,	was	that	the	batsman	thought	the	bowler	was	 bowl 	 ing 	 	fast	.
if	he	had	bowled	fast	,	the	ball	would	have	gone	where	it	was	 me 	 ant 	 	to	go	,	but	it	did	n't	go	.	and	we	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	we	could	be	good	at	 th 	 is 	 	game	.
and	what	it	 al 	 so 	 	did	was	it	led	to	a	certain	 pri 	 de 	 	in	the	fact	that	india	could	be	the	best	in	the	world	.
it	was	at	a	time	when	 invest 	 ment 	 	was	coming	in	,	india	was	 feel 	 ing 	 	a	little	more	confident	about	 it 	 self 	 	.
and	so	there	was	a	 feel 	 ing 	 	that	there	was	great	 pri 	 de 	 	in	what	we	can	do	.
and	 thank 	 fully 	 	for	all	of	us	,	the	english	are	 ver 	 y 	 	good	at	 invent 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,
and	then	the	 gr 	 acious 	 	people	that	they	are	,	they	let	the	world	 be 	 come 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	good	at	it	.
and	so	england	 invent 	 ed 	 	t	20	cricket	,	and	 allow 	 ed 	 	india	to	hijack	it	.
it	was	not	like	reengineering	that	we	do	in	medicine	,	we	just	took	it	straight	away	,	 a 	 s 	 	is	.
and	so	,	we	 launch 	 ed 	 	our	own	t	20	league	.
six	 week 	 s 	 	,	city	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	city	.
it	was	a	new	thing	for	us	.	we	had	 on 	 ly 	 	ever	 support 	 ed 	 	our	country	--	the	 on 	 ly 	 	two	 area 	 s 	 	in	which	india	was	 ver 	 y 	 	proud	about	 the 	 ir 	 	country	,	 represent 	 ing 	 	 it 	 self 	 	on	the	field	.
one	was	war	,	the	indian	 arm 	 y 	 	,	which	we	do	n't	like	to	happen	 ver 	 y 	 	often	.
the	other	was	indian	cricket	.
now	,	 sudden 	 ly 	 	we	had	to	support	city	 league 	 s 	 	.
but	the	people	 get 	 ting 	 	 in 	 to 	 	these	city	 league 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	taking	 the 	 ir 	 	 cue 	 s 	 	from	the	west	.
america	is	a	home	of	 league 	 s 	 	.	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	right	,	we	'll	build	some	glitzy	 league 	 s 	 	here	in	india	.	``
but	was	india	ready	for	it	?
 be 	 cause 	 	cricket	,	for	a	long	time	in	india	was	 al 	 ways 	 	 organize 	 d 	 	.
it	was	never	 promote 	 d 	 	,	it	was	never	 s 	 old 	 	--	it	was	 organize 	 d 	 	.
and	look	what	they	did	with	our	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	nice	,	simple	family	game	.
all	of	a	sudden	,	you	had	that	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
an	 open 	 ing 	 	 ce 	 re 	 mon 	 y 	 	to	match	every	other	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	an	india	that	was	 buy 	 ing 	 	corvettes	.	 th 	 is 	 	was	an	india	that	was	 buy 	 ing 	 	jaguar	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	an	india	that	was	 add 	 ing 	 	more	mobile	 phone 	 s 	 	per	month	than	new	zealand	's	population	twice	over	.
so	,	it	was	a	different	india	.
but	it	was	 al 	 so 	 	a	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	more	orthodox	india	that	was	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	to	be	modern	,	but	did	n't	want	to	say	that	to	people	.
and	so	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	aghast	when	the	 cheer 	 lead 	 ers 	 	 arriv 	 ed 	 	.
 every 	 one 	 	 secret 	 ly 	 	 watch 	 ed 	 	them	,	but	 every 	 one 	 	 claim 	 ed 	 	not	to	.
the	new	 owner 	 s 	 	of	indian	cricket	 we 	 re 	 	not	the	old	 prince 	 s 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	not	 bureaucrat 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	 force 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 s 	 port 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	did	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	love	it	;	these	 we 	 re 	 	people	who	ran	serious	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.
and	so	they	 start 	 ed 	 	promoting	cricket	big	time	,	 start 	 ed 	 	promoting	 club 	 s 	 	big	time	.
and	they	've	 start 	 ed 	 	promoting	them	with	huge	money	 be 	 hind 	 	it	.
i	mean	the	ipl	had	2.3	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	before	a	ball	was	bowled	,
1.6	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	for	 tele 	 vision 	 	revenue	over	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	 an 	 other 	 	70	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	plus	from	all	these	franchises	that	 we 	 re 	 	 put 	 ting 	 	in	money	.	and	then	they	had	to	appeal	to	 the 	 ir 	 	cities	,
but	they	had	to	do	it	like	the	west	,	right	?	 be 	 cause 	 	we	are	setting	up	 league 	 s 	 	.
but	what	they	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	good	at	 do 	 ing 	 	was	making	it	 ver 	 y 	 	 local 	 ized 	 	.
so	,	just	to	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	how	they	did	it	--	not	manchester	 unit 	 ed 	 	style	 pro 	 motion 	 	,	but	 ver 	 y 	 	mumbai	style	 pro 	 motion 	 	.	take	a	look	.
of	course	,	a	lot	of	people	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 may 	 be 	 	they	dance	better	than	they	play	.	``
but	that	's	all	right	.	what	it	did	 al 	 so 	 	is	it	 change 	 d 	 	the	way	we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	cricket	.
all	 a 	 long 	 	,	if	you	 want 	 ed 	 	a	young	cricketer	,	you	 pick 	 ed 	 	him	up	from	the	bylanes	of	your	own	little	 local 	 ity 	 	,	your	own	city	,	and	you	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	proud	of	the	system	that	 produce 	 d 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	cricketers	.
now	,	all	of	the	sudden	,	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	to	bowl	a	shot	--	if	mumbai	 we 	 re 	 	to	bowl	a	shot	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	they	need	n't	go	to	kalbadevi	or	shivaji	park	or	 some 	 where 	 	to	source	them	,	they	could	go	to	trinidad	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	the	new	india	,	was	n't	it	?	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	new	world	,	where	you	can	source	from	 any 	 where 	 	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	you	get	the	best	product	at	the	best	price	.
and	all	of	a	sudden	,	indian	 s 	 port 	 	had	 awake 	 ned 	 	to	the	 re 	 ality 	 	that	you	can	source	the	best	product	for	the	best	price	 any 	 where 	 	in	the	world	.
so	,	the	mumbai	 in 	 d 	 ians 	 	flew	in	dwayne	bravo	from	trinidad	and	tobago	,	 over 	 night 	 	.	and	when	he	had	to	go	back	to	represent	the	west	indies	,	they	 ask 	 ed 	 	him	,	``	when	do	you	have	to	reach	?	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	have	to	be	there	by	a	certain	time	,	so	i	have	to	 leav 	 e 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.	``
we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	no	,	no	.	it	's	not	about	when	you	have	to	 leav 	 e 	 	;	it	's	about	when	do	you	have	to	reach	there	?	``
and	so	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	've	got	to	reach	on	date	x.	``
and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	fine	,	you	play	to	date	x	,	minus	one	.	``	so	,	he	 play 	 ed 	 	in	hyderabad	,	went	,	straight	after	the	game	,	went	from	the	 stad 	 ium 	 	to	hyderabad	 air 	 port 	 	,	 s 	 at 	 	in	a	private	corporate	jet	--	first	 re 	 fuel 	 ing 	 	in	portugal	,	second	 re 	 fuel 	 ing 	 	in	brazil	;	he	was	in	west	indies	in	time	.
never	would	india	have	thought	on	 th 	 is 	 	scale	before	.
never	would	india	have	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	want	a	player	to	play	one	game	for	me	,	and	i	will	use	a	corporate	jet	to	 s 	 end 	 	him	all	the	way	back	to	kingston	,	jamaica	to	play	a	game	.	``
and	i	just	thought	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	``	 w 	 ow 	 	,	we	've	 arriv 	 ed 	 	 some 	 where 	 	in	the	world	,	you	know	?
we	have	 arriv 	 ed 	 	 some 	 where 	 	.	we	are	 think 	 ing 	 	big	.	``
but	what	 th 	 is 	 	 al 	 so 	 	did	was	it	 start 	 ed 	 	 marry 	 ing 	 	the	two	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	in	indian	cricket	,	which	is	cricket	and	the	 movie 	 s 	 	in	indian	 entertain 	 ment 	 	.
there	is	cricket	and	the	 movie 	 s 	 	.
and	they	came	together	 be 	 cause 	 	people	in	the	 movie 	 s 	 	now	 start 	 ed 	 	 own 	 ing 	 	 club 	 s 	 	.
and	so	,	people	 start 	 ed 	 	going	to	the	cricket	to	watch	preity	zinta	.
they	 start 	 ed 	 	going	to	the	cricket	to	watch	shah	rukh	khan	.
and	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
we	 start 	 ed 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	song	and	dance	in	indian	cricket	.
and	so	it	 start 	 ed 	 	 re 	 s 	 em 	 bling 	 	the	indian	 movie 	 s 	 	more	and	more	.
and	of	course	,	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	on	preity	zinta	's	team	--	 a 	 s 	 	you	will	see	on	the	clip	that	 follow 	 s 	 	--	if	you	did	well	,	you	got	a	hug	from	preity	zinta	.
so	that	was	the	ultimate	reason	to	do	well	.	take	a	look	--
 every 	 one 	 	's	 watch 	 ing 	 	preity	zinta	.
and	then	of	course	there	was	shah	rukh	 play 	 ing 	 	the	kolkata	crowd	.
we	'd	all	 s 	 een 	 	 match 	 es 	 	in	kolkata	,	but	we	'd	never	 s 	 een 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	:
shah	rukh	,	with	the	bengali	song	,	 get 	 ting 	 	the	 audience 	 s 	 	all	 work 	 ed 	 	up	for	kolkata	--	not	for	india	,	but	for	kolkata	.
but	take	a	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	.
an	indian	film	star	 hugg 	 ing 	 	a	pakistani	cricketer	 be 	 cause 	 	they	'd	won	in	kolkata	.
can	you	imagine	?
and	do	you	know	what	the	pakistani	cricketer	 s 	 aid 	 	?
``	i	wish	i	was	 play 	 ing 	 	for	preity	zinta	's	team	.	``
but	i	thought	i	'd	take	 th 	 is 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	--	there	's	a	few	people	from	pakistan	in	here	.
i	'm	so	happy	that	you	're	here	 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	we	can	show	that	we	can	both	be	together	and	be	 friend 	 s 	 	,	right	?

one	and	a	half	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	for	six	 week 	 s 	 	'	work	.
that	's	not	bad	,	is	it	?
so	,	at	2.3	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	before	the	first	ball	was	bowled	.
what	india	was	 do 	 ing 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	was	 bench 	 mark 	 ing 	 	 it 	 self 	 	against	the	best	in	the	world	,	and	it	 be 	 came 	 	a	huge	brand	.
lalit	modi	was	on	the	cover	of	business	 to 	 day 	 	.
ipl	 be 	 came 	 	the	 big 	 gest 	 	brand	in	india	and	,	 be 	 cause 	 	our	 election 	 s 	 	,	had	to	be	 move 	 d 	 	to	south	africa	,	and	we	had	to	start	the	tournament	in	three	 week 	 s 	 	.
move	a	whole	tournament	to	south	africa	in	three	 week 	 s 	 	.
but	we	did	it	.	you	know	why	?
 be 	 cause 	 	no	country	 work 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	do	till	three	 week 	 s 	 	before	an	event	,	and	 no 	 body 	 	 work 	 s 	 	fast	 a 	 s 	 	we	do	in	the	last	three	 week 	 s 	 	.
our	population	,	which	for	a	long	time	we	thought	was	a	problem	,	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 be 	 came 	 	our	 big 	 gest 	 	asset	 be 	 cause 	 	there	 we 	 re 	 	more	people	 watch 	 ing 	 	--	the	huge	 consum 	 ing 	 	class	--	 every 	 body 	 	came	to	watch	the	cricket	.
we	'd	 al 	 so 	 	made	cricket	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 s 	 port 	 	in	india	,	which	is	a	 p 	 ity 	 	,	but	in	india	every	other	 s 	 port 	 	 push 	 es 	 	cricket	to	 be 	 come 	 	big	,	which	is	a	bit	of	a	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	of	our	 time 	 s 	 	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	last	minute	before	i	go	--	there	's	a	couple	of	side	 effect 	 s 	 	of	all	 th 	 is 	 	.
for	a	long	time	,	india	was	 th 	 is 	 	country	of	poverty	,	dust	,	 beg 	 gar 	 s 	 	,	snake	charmers	,	filth	,
delhi	 bel 	 ly 	 	--	people	heard	delhi	 bel 	 ly 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	before	they	came	.
and	,	all	of	a	sudden	,	india	was	 th 	 is 	 	land	of	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
cricketers	all	over	the	world	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	,	we	love	india	.	we	love	to	play	in	india	.	``
and	that	felt	good	,	you	know	?
we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	the	dollar	's	 quit 	 e 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	.	``
can	you	imagine	,	you	've	got	the	dollar	on	view	and	there	's	no	delhi	 bel 	 ly 	 	in	there	 any 	 more 	 	.
there	's	no	filth	,	there	's	no	 beg 	 gar 	 s 	 	,	all	the	snake	charmers	have	 vanish 	 ed 	 	,
 every 	 body 	 	's	gone	.	 th 	 is 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	you	how	the	 capital 	 ist 	 	world	 rule 	 s 	 	.
right	so	,	 final 	 ly 	 	,	an	english	game	that	india	usurped	a	little	bit	,	but	t	20	is	going	to	be	the	next	 mission 	 ary 	 	in	the	world	.
if	you	want	to	take	the	game	around	the	world	,	it	's	got	to	be	the	 short 	 est 	 	form	of	the	game	.
you	ca	n't	take	a	 time 	 less 	 	test	to	 chin 	 a 	 	and	 s 	 it 	 	through	14	 day 	 s 	 	with	no	result	in	the	end	,	or	you	ca	n't	take	it	all	over	the	world	.
so	that	's	what	t	20	is	 do 	 ing 	 	.
 hope 	 fully 	 	,	it	'll	make	 every 	 one 	 	 rich 	 er 	 	,	 hope 	 fully 	 	it	'll	make	the	game	 big 	 ger 	 	and	 hope 	 fully 	 	it	'll	give	cricket	 comment 	 ators 	 	more	time	in	the	business	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.	thank	you	.
