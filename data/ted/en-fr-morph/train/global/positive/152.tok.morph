it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	to	speak	at	the	end	of	a	 con 	 ference 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,
 be 	 cause 	 	 every 	 one 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	spoken	.	 every 	 thing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	.
so	i	thought	that	what	may	be	 use 	 ful 	 	is	to	 re 	 mind 	 	us	of	some	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	have	gone	on	here	,	and	then	 may 	 be 	 	 off 	 er 	 	some	 idea 	 s 	 	which	we	can	take	away	,	and	take	forward	and	work	on	.
that	's	what	i	'd	like	to	try	and	do	.
we	came	here	 say 	 ing 	 	we	want	to	talk	about	``	africa	:	the	next	chapter	.	``
but	we	are	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	``	africa	:	the	next	chapter	``	 be 	 cause 	 	we	are	looking	at	the	old	and	the	present	chapter	--	that	we	're	looking	at	,	and	 say 	 ing 	 	it	's	not	 s 	 uch 	 	a	good	thing	.
the	picture	i	 show 	 ed 	 	you	before	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	picture	,	of	drought	,	death	and	disease	is	what	we	 usual 	 ly 	 	see	.
what	we	want	to	look	at	is	``	africa	:	the	next	chapter	,	``
and	that	's	 th 	 is 	 	:	a	 health 	 y 	 	,	 smil 	 ing 	 	,	 beaut 	 iful 	 	african	.
and	i	think	it	's	worth	 remember 	 ing 	 	what	we	've	heard	through	the	 con 	 ference 	 	right	from	the	first	day	,	where	i	heard	that	all	the	 import 	 ant 	 	 statistic 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 give 	 n 	 	--	about	where	we	are	now	,	about	how	the	continent	is	 do 	 ing 	 	much	better	.
and	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	that	is	that	we	have	a	platform	to	build	on	.
so	i	'm	not	going	to	 s 	 pend 	 	too	much	time	--	just	to	show	you	,	 re 	 fresh 	 	your	 memor 	 ies 	 	that	we	are	here	for	``	africa	:	the	next	chapter	``	 be 	 cause 	 	for	the	first	time	there	 re 	 ally 	 	is	a	platform	to	build	on	.
we	 re 	 ally 	 	do	have	it	going	right	that	the	continent	is	growing	at	rates	that	people	had	thought	would	not	happen	.
after	 decade 	 s 	 	of	2	percent	,	we	are	now	at	5	percent	,	and	it	's	going	to	--	 project 	 ed 	 	--	6	and	7	percent	even	.
and	 infla 	 tion 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	come	down	.
external	debt	--	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	can	tell	you	a	long	story	about	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 personal 	 ly 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	on	one	of	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 debt 	 s 	 	on	the	continent	--	 ha 	 s 	 	come	down	 dramat 	 ically 	 	.
you	know	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	from	 al 	 most 	 	50	billion	down	to	about	12	or	13	billion	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	huge	 achiev 	 ement 	 	.
you	know	,	we	've	built	up	 re 	 serve 	 s 	 	.	why	is	that	 import 	 ant 	 	?
it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 show 	 s 	 	off	our	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	,	 show 	 s 	 	off	our	 curr 	 encies 	 	and	 give 	 s 	 	a	platform	on	which	people	can	plan	and	build	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 business 	 es 	 	.
we	've	 al 	 so 	 	 s 	 een 	 	some	evidence	that	all	 th 	 is 	 	is	making	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	private	 invest 	 ment 	 	 flow 	 s 	 	have	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	.
i	want	to	 re 	 mind 	 	you	 aga 	 in 	 	--	i	know	you	saw	these	 statistic 	 s 	 	before	--	from	 al 	 most 	 	6	billion	we	are	now	at	about	18	billion	.
in	2005	,	remittances	--	i	just	took	one	country	,	nigeria	 skyrocket 	 ing 	 	--	 skyrocket 	 ing 	 	is	too	 dramat 	 ic 	 	,	but	increasing	 dramat 	 ically 	 	.
and	in	 man 	 y 	 	other	 count 	 ries 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
why	is	 th 	 is 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	?	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 show 	 s 	 	confidence	.
people	are	now	confident	to	 br 	 ing 	 	--	if	your	people	in	the	diaspora	 br 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	money	back	,	it	 show 	 s 	 	other	people	that	,	look	,	there	is	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	confidence	in	your	country	.
and	 in 	 stead 	 	of	an	outflow	,	you	are	now	 get 	 ting 	 	a	net	 in 	 flow 	 	.
now	,	why	is	all	 th 	 is 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	to	have	to	go	 re 	 ally 	 	fast	?
it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	that	we	build	 th 	 is 	 	platform	,	that	we	have	the	 p 	 resident 	 	,	kikwete	,	and	 other 	 s 	 	of	our	 lead 	 ers 	 	who	are	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	look	,	we	must	do	 some 	 thing 	 	different	.	``
 be 	 cause 	 	we	are	 confront 	 ed 	 	with	a	 challeng 	 e 	 	.
62	percent	of	our	population	is	 be 	 low 	 	the	age	of	24	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	mean	?
 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	we	have	to	focus	on	how	our	youth	are	going	to	be	 engag 	 ed 	 	in	productive	endeavor	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
you	have	to	focus	on	how	to	create	 job 	 s 	 	,	make	 s 	 ure 	 	they	do	n't	fall	 in 	 to 	 	disease	,	and	that	they	get	an	education	.
but	most	of	all	that	they	are	 productive 	 ly 	 	 engag 	 ed 	 	in	life	,	and	that	they	are	creating	the	kind	of	productive	environment	in	our	 count 	 ries 	 	that	will	make	 thing 	 s 	 	happen	.
and	to	support	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	just	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	--	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	since	 leav 	 ing 	 	government	is	to	start	an	opinion	research	 organ 	 ization 	 	in	nigeria	.
most	of	our	 count 	 ries 	 	do	n't	even	have	any	opinion	research	.
people	do	n't	have	voice	.
there	is	no	way	you	can	know	what	people	want	.
one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	was	what	's	 the 	 ir 	 	top	issue	.
like	in	every	other	country	where	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	,	 job 	 s 	 	is	the	top	issue	.
i	want	to	 leav 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	up	here	and	come	back	to	it	.
but	before	i	get	to	 th 	 is 	 	slide	,	i	just	 want 	 ed 	 	to	run	you	through	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	to	say	that	for	me	,	the	next	stage	of	building	 th 	 is 	 	platform	that	now	 en 	 able 	 s 	 	us	to	move	forward	--	and	we	must	n't	make	light	of	it	.
it	was	 on 	 ly 	 	5	,	6	,	7	 year 	 s 	 	ago	we	could	n't	even	talk	about	the	next	chapter	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	in	the	old	chapter	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	going	 no 	 where 	 	.
the	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	 we 	 re 	 	not	growing	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	negative	per	capita	growth	.
the	microeconomic	 frame 	 work 	 	and	 found 	 ation 	 	for	moving	forward	was	not	even	there	.
so	let	's	not	forget	that	it	's	taken	a	lot	to	build	 th 	 is 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	do	in	nigeria	that	dele	 refer 	 red 	 	to	.
creating	our	own	program	to	solve	 problem 	 s 	 	,	like	 fight 	 ing 	 	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	,	building	 institution 	 s 	 	,	stabilizing	the	micro	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
so	now	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	platform	we	can	build	on	.
and	it	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	us	to	the	debate	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	going	on	here	:	aid	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	private	sector	,	aid	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	trade	,	etc	.
and	 some 	 one 	 	stood	up	to	say	that	one	of	the	 frust 	 rating 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	is	that	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	 simpl 	 istic 	 	debate	.
and	that	's	not	what	the	debate	should	be	about	.
that	's	 engag 	 ing 	 	in	the	wrong	debate	.
the	issue	here	is	how	do	we	get	a	 partner 	 ship 	 	that	 involve 	 s 	 	government	 donor 	 s 	 	,	the	private	sector	and	 ordin 	 ary 	 	african	people	taking	charge	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 live 	 s 	 	?
how	do	we	combine	all	 th 	 is 	 	?
to	move	our	continent	forward	,	to	do	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	need	 do 	 ing 	 	that	i	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	--	 get 	 ting 	 	young	people	 employ 	 ed 	 	.
 get 	 ting 	 	the	creative	 juice 	 s 	 	 flow 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	continent	,	much	of	what	you	have	 s 	 een 	 	here	.
so	i	'm	 af 	 raid 	 	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 engag 	 ing 	 	a	little	bit	in	the	wrong	debate	.
we	need	to	 br 	 ing 	 	it	back	to	say	,	what	is	the	combination	of	all	these	 factor 	 s 	 	that	is	going	to	yield	what	we	want	?
and	i	want	to	tell	you	 some 	 thing 	 	.
for	me	,	the	issue	about	aid	--
i	do	n't	think	that	africans	need	to	now	go	all	the	way	over	to	the	other	side	and	feel	bad	about	aid	.
africa	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	giving	the	other	 count 	 ries 	 	aid	.
mo	ibrahim	 s 	 aid 	 	at	a	debate	we	 we 	 re 	 	at	that	he	 dream 	 s 	 	one	day	when	africa	will	be	giving	aid	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	mo	,	you	're	right	.	we	have	--	no	,	but	we	've	 al 	 ready 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	it	!
the	u.k.	and	the	u.s.	could	not	have	 be 	 en 	 	built	 to 	 day 	 	 with 	 out 	 	africa	's	aid	.	``
it	is	all	the	 resource 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	taken	from	africa	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	human	,	that	built	these	 count 	 ries 	 	 to 	 day 	 	!
so	when	they	try	to	give	back	,	we	should	n't	be	on	the	defensive	.
the	issue	is	not	that	.
the	issue	is	how	are	we	using	what	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 give 	 n 	 	back	.
how	are	we	using	it	?
is	it	 be 	 ing 	 	 direct 	 ed 	 	 effective 	 ly 	 	?
i	want	to	tell	you	a	little	story	.
why	i	do	n't	mind	if	we	get	aid	,	but	we	use	it	well	.
from	1967	to	'70	,	nigeria	 f 	 ought 	 	a	war	--	the	nigeria	-	biafra	war	.
and	in	the	middle	of	that	war	,	i	was	14	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
we	 s 	 pent 	 	much	of	our	time	with	my	mother	 cook 	 ing 	 	.
for	the	 arm 	 y 	 	--	my	father	 join 	 ed 	 	the	 arm 	 y 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	brigadier	--	the	biafran	 arm 	 y 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	on	the	biafran	side	.
and	we	 we 	 re 	 	down	to	eating	one	meal	a	day	,	running	from	place	to	place	,	but	 where 	 ver 	 	we	could	help	we	did	.
at	a	certain	point	in	time	,	in	1969	,	 thing 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	down	to	 al 	 most 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	a	meal	a	day	.
people	,	children	 we 	 re 	 	 dy 	 ing 	 	of	kwashiorkor	.
i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	some	of	you	who	are	not	so	young	will	remember	 t 	 hose 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	.
well	,	i	was	in	the	middle	of	it	.
in	the	 mid 	 st 	 	of	all	 th 	 is 	 	,	my	mother	fell	ill	with	a	stomach	ailment	for	two	or	three	 day 	 s 	 	.
we	thought	she	was	going	to	die	.
my	father	was	not	there	.
he	was	in	the	 arm 	 y 	 	.
so	i	was	the	 old 	 est 	 	person	in	the	house	.
my	sister	fell	 ver 	 y 	 	ill	with	malaria	.
she	was	three	 year 	 s 	 	old	and	i	was	15	.
and	she	had	 s 	 uch 	 	a	high	 f 	 ever 	 	.	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	.
it	did	n't	look	like	it	was	going	to	work	.
 un 	 til 	 	we	heard	that	10	 kilometer 	 s 	 	away	there	was	a	doctor	,	who	was	looking	at	people	and	giving	them	 med 	 s 	 	.
now	i	put	my	sister	on	my	back	--	 burn 	 ing 	 	--	and	i	 walk 	 ed 	 	10	 kilometer 	 s 	 	with	her	 s 	 trapped 	 	on	my	back	.
it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	hot	.	i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 hung 	 ry 	 	.
i	was	 scar 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 k 	 new 	 	her	life	 depend 	 ed 	 	on	my	 get 	 ting 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	woman	.
we	heard	there	was	a	woman	doctor	who	was	 treat 	 ing 	 	people	.
i	 walk 	 ed 	 	10	 kilometer 	 s 	 	,	 put 	 ting 	 	one	foot	in	front	of	the	other	.
i	got	there	and	i	saw	huge	 crowd 	 s 	 	.
 al 	 most 	 	a	thousand	people	 we 	 re 	 	there	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	break	down	the	door	.
she	was	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	a	church	.	how	was	i	going	to	get	in	?
i	had	to	crawl	in	between	the	 leg 	 s 	 	of	these	people	with	my	sister	 s 	 trapped 	 	on	my	back	,	find	a	way	to	a	window	.
and	while	they	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	break	down	the	door	,	i	 climb 	 ed 	 	in	through	the	window	,	and	 jump 	 ed 	 	in	.
 th 	 is 	 	woman	told	me	it	was	in	the	nick	of	time	.
by	the	time	we	 jump 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	that	hall	,	she	was	 bare 	 ly 	 	moving	.
she	 g 	 ave 	 	a	shot	of	her	chloroquine	--	what	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	was	the	chloroquine	then	--	 g 	 ave 	 	her	some	--	it	must	have	 be 	 en 	 	a	re	-	hydration	--	and	some	other	 ther 	 a 	 pies 	 	,	and	put	us	in	a	corner	.
in	about	two	to	three	 hour 	 s 	 	,	she	 start 	 ed 	 	to	move	.
and	then	they	toweled	her	down	 be 	 cause 	 	she	 start 	 ed 	 	 sweat 	 ing 	 	,	which	was	a	good	sign	.
and	then	my	sister	 wok 	 e 	 	up	.
and	about	five	or	six	 hour 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	she	 s 	 aid 	 	we	could	go	home	.
i	 s 	 trapped 	 	her	on	my	back	.
i	 walk 	 ed 	 	the	10	 kilometer 	 s 	 	back	and	it	was	the	 short 	 est 	 	walk	i	ever	had	.
i	was	so	happy	--	--	that	my	sister	was	 al 	 ive 	 	!
 to 	 day 	 	she	's	41	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	a	mother	of	three	,	and	she	's	a	physician	saving	other	 live 	 s 	 	.
why	am	i	 tell 	 ing 	 	that	?	i	'm	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	that	 be 	 cause 	 	--	when	it	is	you	or	your	person	 involve 	 d 	 	--	you	do	n't	care	where	--	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	aid	.
you	do	n't	care	what	it	is	!
you	just	want	the	person	to	be	 al 	 ive 	 	!
and	now	let	me	 be 	 come 	 	less	 sentiment 	 al 	 	,	and	say	that	saving	 live 	 s 	 	--	which	some	of	the	aid	we	get	 do 	 es 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	continent	--	when	you	 s 	 ave 	 	the	life	of	 any 	 one 	 	,	a	 farm 	 er 	 	,	a	teacher	,	a	mother	,	they	are	 con 	 trib 	 uting 	 	 productive 	 ly 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	an	economist	,	we	can	 al 	 so 	 	look	at	that	side	of	the	story	.
these	are	people	who	are	productive	 agent 	 s 	 	in	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
so	if	we	 s 	 ave 	 	people	from	hiv	/	 aid 	 s 	 	,	if	we	 s 	 ave 	 	them	from	malaria	,	it	 mean 	 s 	 	they	can	form	the	base	of	production	for	our	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
and	by	the	same	 to 	 ken 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 one 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	 yester 	 day 	 	--	if	we	do	n't	and	they	die	,	 the 	 ir 	 	children	will	 be 	 come 	 	a	burden	on	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
so	even	from	an	economic	 stand 	 point 	 	,	if	we	 leav 	 e 	 	the	social	and	the	 human 	 itarian 	 	,	we	need	to	 s 	 ave 	 	 live 	 s 	 	now	.
so	that	's	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	,	from	a	personal	experience	,	that	i	say	let	's	channel	these	 resource 	 s 	 	we	get	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	productive	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	i	will	 al 	 so 	 	tell	you	that	i	'm	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	who	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	sole	answer	.
that	's	why	i	 s 	 aid 	 	the	debate	 ha 	 s 	 	to	get	more	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	.
you	know	,	we	have	to	use	it	well	.
what	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	europe	?
do	you	all	know	that	spain	--	part	of	the	eu	--	got	10	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	aid	from	the	rest	of	the	eu	?
 resource 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 transfer 	 red 	 	to	them	--	and	 we 	 re 	 	the	spanish	 a 	 shame 	 d 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	?	no	!
the	eu	 transfer 	 red 	 	10	billion	.	where	did	they	use	it	?
have	you	 be 	 en 	 	to	southern	spain	 late 	 ly 	 	?	there	are	 road 	 s 	 	 every 	 where 	 	.
 infra 	 structure 	 	 every 	 where 	 	.
it	is	on	the	back	of	 th 	 is 	 	that	the	whole	of	southern	spain	 ha 	 s 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 service 	 s 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
did	you	know	that	ireland	got	3	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	aid	?
ireland	is	one	of	the	 fast 	 est 	 	-	growing	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	in	the	european	 un 	 ion 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
for	which	 man 	 y 	 	people	,	even	from	other	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	world	,	are	going	there	to	find	 job 	 s 	 	.
what	did	they	do	with	the	3	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	aid	?
they	used	it	to	build	an	information	superhighway	,	gain	 infra 	 structure 	 	that	 en 	 able 	 s 	 	them	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	in	the	information	technology	revolution	,
and	to	create	 job 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
they	did	n't	say	,	``	no	,	you	know	,	we	're	not	going	to	take	 th 	 is 	 	.	``
 to 	 day 	 	,	the	european	 un 	 ion 	 	is	 bus 	 y 	 	 transfer 	 ring 	 	aid	.
my	 frust 	 ration 	 	is	if	they	can	build	 infra 	 structure 	 	in	spain	--	which	is	 road 	 s 	 	,	 high 	 ways 	 	,	other	 thing 	 s 	 	that	they	can	build	--	i	say	then	,	why	do	they	 re 	 fuse 	 	to	use	the	same	aid	to	build	the	same	 infra 	 structure 	 	in	our	 count 	 ries 	 	?
when	we	ask	them	and	tell	them	what	we	need	,
one	of	my	 worri 	 es 	 	 to 	 day 	 	is	that	we	have	 man 	 y 	 	 found 	 ations 	 	now	.
now	we	talk	about	the	world	bank	,	imf	,	and	 account 	 ability 	 	,	all	that
and	the	eu	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	have	private	 citizen 	 s 	 	now	who	have	a	lot	of	money	--
some	of	them	in	 th 	 is 	 	audience	,	with	private	 found 	 ations 	 	.
and	one	day	,	these	 found 	 ations 	 	have	so	much	money	,	they	will	 over 	 take 	 	the	official	aid	that	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 give 	 n 	 	.
but	i	fear	--	and	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	 grat 	 e 	 ful 	 	to	all	of	them	for	what	they	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	on	the	continent	--	but	i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	 worri 	 ed 	 	.	i	wake	up	with	a	 gna 	 wing 	 	in	my	 bel 	 ly 	 
 be 	 cause 	 	i	see	a	new	set	of	aid	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	on	the	continent	.
and	they	're	 al 	 so 	 	going	from	country	to	country	,	and	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	find	what	to	do	.
but	i	'm	not	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	that	 the 	 ir 	 	 assist 	 ance 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 channel 	 ed 	 	in	the	right	way	.
and	 man 	 y 	 	of	them	are	not	 re 	 ally 	 	familiar	with	the	continent	.
they	are	just	 discover 	 ing 	 	.
and	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	i	do	n't	see	africans	 work 	 ing 	 	with	them	.
they	are	just	going	 al 	 one 	 	!
and	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	i	get	the	impression	that	they	are	not	 re 	 ally 	 	even	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 hear 	 ing 	 	from	africans	who	might	know	.
they	want	to	visit	us	,	see	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	on	the	ground	and	make	a	decision	.
and	now	i	'm	 may 	 be 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	harsh	.
but	i	worry	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	money	is	so	 import 	 ant 	 	.
now	,	who	are	they	 account 	 able 	 	to	?
are	we	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 board 	 s 	 	when	they	make	 decision 	 s 	 	about	where	to	channel	money	?	are	we	there	?
will	we	make	the	same	 mistak 	 e 	 	that	we	made	before	?
have	our	 pre 	 sidents 	 	and	our	 lead 	 ers 	 	--	 every 	 one 	 	is	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	--	have	they	ever	 call 	 ed 	 	these	people	together	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	look	,	your	 found 	 ation 	 	and	your	 found 	 ation 	 	--	you	have	so	much	money	,	we	are	 grat 	 e 	 ful 	 	.
let	's	 s 	 it 	 	down	and	 re 	 ally 	 	tell	you	where	the	money	should	be	 channel 	 ed 	 	and	where	 th 	 is 	 	aid	should	go	.	``
have	we	 d 	 one 	 	that	?	the	answer	is	no	.
and	each	one	is	making	 the 	 ir 	 	own	individual	effort	.
and	then	10	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	,	 billion 	 s 	 	will	 aga 	 in 	 	have	gone	 in 	 to 	 	africa	,	and	we	would	still	have	the	same	 problem 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 give 	 s 	 	us	the	 hope 	 less 	 	image	.
our	 in 	 ability 	 	to	take	charge	and	say	to	all	these	people	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	money	,	``	 s 	 it 	 	down	.	``	and	we	do	n't	do	it	 be 	 cause 	 	there	are	so	 man 	 y 	 	of	us	.	we	do	n't	coordinate	.
we	've	not	 call 	 ed 	 	the	bill	 gate 	 s 	 	,	and	the	soros	,	and	 every 	 body 	 	else	who	is	 help 	 ing 	 	and	say	,	``	 s 	 it 	 	down	.	let	's	have	a	 con 	 ference 	 	with	you	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	continent	,	here	are	our	 prior 	 ities 	 	.
here	is	where	we	want	you	to	channel	 th 	 is 	 	money	.	``
each	one	should	not	be	an	entrepreneur	going	out	and	 find 	 ing 	 	what	is	best	.
we	're	not	 try 	 ing 	 	to	stop	them	at	all	!	but	to	help	them	help	us	better	.
and	what	is	 disappoint 	 ing 	 	me	is	that	we	are	not	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
ten	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	we	will	have	the	same	story	,	and	we	will	be	 repeat 	 ing 	 	the	same	 thing 	 s 	 	.
so	our	problem	right	now	is	,	how	can	we	leverage	all	 th 	 is 	 	good	will	that	is	coming	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	our	way	?
how	can	we	get	government	to	combine	 proper 	 ly 	 	with	these	private	 found 	 ations 	 	,	with	the	 inter 	 national 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	,	and	with	our	private	sector	.
i	 firm 	 ly 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	in	that	private	sector	thing	too	.
but	it	can	not	do	it	 al 	 one 	 	.
so	there	might	be	a	few	 idea 	 s 	 	we	could	think	of	that	could	work	.
they	 s 	 aid 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	about	 pro 	 life 	 rating 	 	and	sharing	 idea 	 s 	 	.
so	why	do	n't	we	think	of	using	some	of	 th 	 is 	 	aid	?
well	,	why	do	n't	we	first	say	to	 t 	 hose 	 	 help 	 ing 	 	us	out	,	``	do	n't	be	 s 	 hy 	 	about	 infra 	 structure 	 	.
that	health	that	you	're	 work 	 ing 	 	on	can	not	be	 sustain 	 able 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 infra 	 structure 	 	.
that	education	will	work	better	if	we	've	got	 electric 	 ity 	 	and	 rail 	 road 	 s 	 	,	and	so	on	.
that	 agricultur 	 e 	 	will	work	better	if	there	are	 rail 	 road 	 s 	 	to	get	the	 good 	 s 	 	to	market	.
do	n't	be	 s 	 hy 	 	of	it	.
invest	some	of	your	 resource 	 s 	 	in	that	,	too	.	``
and	then	we	can	see	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	combination	of	private	,	 inter 	 national 	 	,	 multi 	 lateral 	 	money	,	private	sector	and	the	african	that	we	can	put	together	 a 	 s 	 	a	 partner 	 ship 	 	,	so	that	aid	can	be	a	facilitator	.
that	is	all	aid	can	be	.
aid	can	not	solve	our	 problem 	 s 	 	,	i	'm	 firm 	 ly 	 	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	about	that	.
but	it	can	be	catalytic	.	and	if	we	fail	to	use	it	 a 	 s 	 	catalytic	,	we	would	have	 fail 	 ed 	 	.
one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	why	 chin 	 a 	 	is	a	bit	popular	with	africans	now	--	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	is	not	 on 	 ly 	 	just	that	,	you	know	,	these	people	are	stupid	and	 chin 	 a 	 	is	coming	to	take	 resource 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	a	little	more	leverage	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	chinese	.
if	you	tell	them	,	``	we	need	a	road	here	,	``	they	will	help	you	build	it	.
they	do	n't	 s 	 hy 	 	away	from	 infra 	 structure 	 	.
in	fact	,	the	chinese	 mini 	 ster 	 	of	finance	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	when	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	him	what	are	we	 do 	 ing 	 	wrong	in	nigeria	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	there	are	two	 thing 	 s 	 	you	need	 on 	 ly 	 	.	 infra 	 structure 	 	,	 infra 	 structure 	 	,	 infra 	 structure 	 	and	discipline	.
you	are	undisciplined	.	``
and	i	repeat	it	for	the	continent	.
it	's	the	same	.	we	need	 infra 	 structure 	 	,	 infra 	 structure 	 	and	discipline	.
so	we	can	make	a	catalytic	to	help	us	provide	some	of	that	.
now	i	 real 	 ize 	 	--	i	'm	not	 say 	 ing 	 	--	health	and	education	--	no	,	you	can	 al 	 so 	 	provide	that	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
but	i	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	it	's	not	either	or	.
let	's	see	how	aid	can	be	a	facilitator	in	 partner 	 ship 	 	.
one	idea	.
second	thing	,	for	the	private	sector	,
people	are	 af 	 raid 	 	to	take	 risk 	 s 	 	on	the	continent	.
why	ca	n't	some	of	 th 	 is 	 	aid	be	used	 a 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	guarantee	 mechan 	 ism 	 s 	 	,	to	 en 	 able 	 	people	to	take	risk	?
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	both	 stand 	 ing 	 	at	my	--	i	'm	out	of	time	.
am	i	out	of	time	?
ok	,	so	let	me	not	forget	my	 punch 	 line 	 	.
one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	i	want	 every 	 body 	 	to	 collabor 	 ate 	 	on	is	to	support	women	,	to	create	 job 	 s 	 	.
a	lot	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	here	about	women	,	i	do	n't	need	to	repeat	it	.
but	there	are	people	--	women	--	creating	 job 	 s 	 	.
and	we	know	,	 stud 	 ies 	 	have	 show 	 n 	 	that	when	you	put	 resource 	 s 	 	in	the	hand	of	the	woman	--	in	fact	,	there	's	an	econometric	 stud 	 y 	 	,	the	world	bank	review	,	 d 	 one 	 	in	2000	,	 show 	 ing 	 	that	 transfer 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 hand 	 s 	 	of	women	result	in	 health 	 ier 	 	children	,	more	for	the	 house 	 hold 	 	,	more	for	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	and	all	that	.
so	i	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	that	one	of	the	takeaways	from	here	--	i	'm	not	 say 	 ing 	 	the	men	are	not	 import 	 ant 	 	--	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	if	you	 leav 	 e 	 	the	 husband 	 s 	 	out	,	what	will	they	do	?
they	'll	come	back	home	and	get	 dis 	 grunt 	 led 	 	,	and	it	will	result	in	 difficult 	 ies 	 	we	do	n't	want	.
we	do	n't	want	men	 beat 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	wives	 be 	 cause 	 	they	do	n't	have	a	job	,	and	so	on	.
but	at	the	margin	,	we	 al 	 so 	 	--	i	want	to	push	 th 	 is 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	reason	is	the	men	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	--	they	get	--	not	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	,	but	they	tend	to	get	more	support	.
but	i	want	you	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	 resource 	 s 	 	in	the	 hand 	 s 	 	of	african	women	is	a	 power 	 ful 	 	tool	.
there	are	people	creating	 job 	 s 	 	.	beatrice	gakuba	 ha 	 s 	 	 create 	 d 	 	200	 job 	 s 	 	from	her	flower	business	in	rwanda	.
we	have	ibukun	awosika	in	nigeria	,	with	the	chair	company	.
she	 want 	 s 	 	to	expand	.
she	 need 	 s 	 	 an 	 other 	 	20	million	.
she	will	create	 an 	 other 	 	100	,	200	more	 job 	 s 	 	.
so	take	away	from	here	is	how	are	you	going	to	put	together	the	 resource 	 s 	 	to	put	money	in	the	 hand 	 s 	 	of	women	in	the	middle	who	are	ready	--	business	people	who	want	to	expand	and	create	more	 job 	 s 	 	.
and	 last 	 ly 	 	,	what	are	you	going	to	do	to	be	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	 partner 	 ship 	 	of	aid	,	government	,	private	sector	and	the	african	 a 	 s 	 	an	individual	?
thank	you	.
