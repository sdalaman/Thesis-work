i	'll	just	take	you	to	bangladesh	for	a	minute	.
before	i	tell	that	story	,	we	should	ask	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	the	question	:	why	 do 	 es 	 	poverty	exist	?
i	mean	,	there	is	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	knowledge	and	scientific	 break 	 through 	 s 	 	.
we	all	live	in	the	same	planet	,	but	there	's	still	a	great	deal	of	poverty	in	the	world	.
and	i	think	--	so	i	want	to	throw	a	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	that	i	have	,	so	that	we	can	assess	 th 	 is 	 	project	,	or	any	other	project	,	for	that	matter	,	to	see	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	 con 	 trib 	 uting 	 	or	--	 con 	 trib 	 uting 	 	to	poverty	or	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 allevi 	 ate 	 	it	.
rich	 count 	 ries 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	aid	to	poor	 count 	 ries 	 	for	the	last	60	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	by	and	large	,	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 fail 	 ed 	 	.	and	you	can	see	 th 	 is 	 	book	,	written	by	 some 	 one 	 	who	 work 	 ed 	 	in	the	world	bank	for	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	he	 find 	 s 	 	economic	growth	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	to	be	elusive	.
by	and	large	,	it	did	not	work	.
so	the	question	is	,	why	is	that	?
in	my	mind	,	there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	to	learn	from	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	europe	.
i	mean	,	even	here	,	 yester 	 day 	 	i	was	 walk 	 ing 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	street	,	and	they	 show 	 ed 	 	three	bishops	 we 	 re 	 	 execute 	 d 	 	500	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	right	 a 	 cross 	 	the	street	from	here	.
so	my	point	is	,	there	's	a	lot	of	struggle	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	in	europe	,	where	 citizen 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 empower 	 ed 	 	by	 techno 	 logies 	 	.
and	they	 demand 	 ed 	 	 author 	 ities 	 	from	--	to	come	down	from	 the 	 ir 	 	high	 horse 	 s 	 	.
and	in	the	end	,	there	's	better	 bar 	 gain 	 ing 	 	between	the	 author 	 ities 	 	and	 citizen 	 s 	 	,	and	 demo 	 cracies 	 	,	 capital 	 ism 	 	--	 every 	 thing 	 	else	 flourish 	 ed 	 	.
and	so	you	can	see	,	the	real	process	of	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 back 	 ed 	 	up	by	 th 	 is 	 	500	-	page	book	--	that	the	 author 	 ities 	 	came	down	and	 citizen 	 s 	 	got	up	.
but	if	you	look	,	if	you	have	that	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	then	you	can	see	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	last	60	 year 	 s 	 	.
aid	 actual 	 ly 	 	did	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	.
it	 empower 	 ed 	 	 author 	 ities 	 	,
and	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	,	 marginal 	 ized 	 	 citizen 	 s 	 	.
the	 author 	 ities 	 	did	not	have	the	reason	to	make	economic	growth	happen	so	that	they	could	tax	people	and	make	more	money	for	to	run	 the 	 ir 	 	business	.
 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	it	from	 a 	 broad 	 	.
and	in	fact	,	if	you	see	oil	-	rich	 count 	 ries 	 	,	where	 citizen 	 s 	 	are	not	yet	 empower 	 ed 	 	,	the	same	thing	 go 	 es 	 	--
nigeria	,	saudi	arabia	,	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 count 	 ries 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	aid	and	oil	or	mineral	money	 act 	 s 	 	the	same	way	.
it	 empower 	 s 	 	 author 	 ities 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	 activ 	 ating 	 	the	 citizen 	 s 	 	--	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	,	 leg 	 s 	 	,	 brain 	 s 	 	,	what	have	you	.
and	if	you	agree	with	that	,	then	i	think	the	best	way	to	improve	these	 count 	 ries 	 	is	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	that	economic	 develop 	 ment 	 	is	of	the	people	,	by	the	people	,	for	the	people	.
and	that	is	the	real	network	effect	.
if	 citizen 	 s 	 	can	network	and	make	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	more	 organize 	 d 	 	and	productive	,	so	that	 the 	 ir 	 	 voice 	 s 	 	are	heard	,	so	then	 thing 	 s 	 	would	improve	.
and	to	contrast	that	,	you	can	see	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	institution	in	the	world	,	the	world	bank	,	is	an	 organ 	 ization 	 	of	the	government	,	by	the	government	,	for	the	 government 	 s 	 	.
just	see	the	contrast	.
and	that	is	the	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	i	have	,	and	then	i	can	start	my	story	.
of	course	,	how	would	you	empower	 citizen 	 s 	 	?
there	could	be	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 techno 	 logies 	 	.	and	one	is	cell	 phone 	 s 	 	.
 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	``	the	economist	``	 recogn 	 ized 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	i	 s 	 tumble 	 d 	 	 up 	 on 	 	the	idea	12	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	that	's	what	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	.
so	12	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	be	an	 invest 	 ment 	 	 bank 	 er 	 	in	new	york	.
we	had	--	 quit 	 e 	 	a	few	our	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	by	a	computer	network	.
and	we	got	more	productive	 be 	 cause 	 	we	did	n't	have	to	 ex 	 change 	 	 flop 	 py 	 	 dis 	 k 	 s 	 	;	we	could	update	each	other	more	often	.
but	one	time	it	broke	down	.
and	it	 re 	 minded 	 	me	of	a	day	in	1971	.
there	was	a	war	going	on	in	my	country	.
and	my	family	 move 	 d 	 	out	of	an	urban	place	,	where	we	used	to	live	,	to	a	remote	 r 	 ural 	 	area	where	it	was	 safe 	 r 	 	.
and	one	time	my	mother	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	to	get	some	medicine	for	a	 young 	 er 	 	 s 	 i 	 bling 	 	.
and	i	 walk 	 ed 	 	10	 mile 	 s 	 	or	so	,	all	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	to	get	there	,	to	the	medicine	man	.
and	he	was	n't	there	,	so	i	 walk 	 ed 	 	all	afternoon	back	.
so	i	had	 an 	 other 	 	 un 	 productive 	 	day	.
so	while	i	was	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	a	tall	building	in	new	york	,	i	put	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 experience 	 s 	 	together	side	by	side	,	and	 bas 	 ically 	 	 conclude 	 d 	 	that	 connect 	 ivity 	 	is	 product 	 ivity 	 	--	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	in	a	modern	 off 	 ice 	 	or	an	 under 	 develop 	 ed 	 	village	.
so	 natural 	 ly 	 	,	i	--	the	 implic 	 ation 	 	of	that	is	that	the	 tele 	 phone 	 	is	a	weapon	against	poverty	.
and	if	that	's	the	case	,	then	the	question	is	how	 man 	 y 	 	 tele 	 phone 	 s 	 	did	we	have	at	that	time	?
and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	that	there	was	one	 tele 	 phone 	 	in	bangladesh	for	every	500	people	.
and	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 phone 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	in	the	few	urban	 place 	 s 	 	.
the	vast	 r 	 ural 	 	 area 	 s 	 	,	where	100	million	people	lived	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	no	 tele 	 phone 	 s 	 	.
so	just	imagine	how	 man 	 y 	 	man	-	 month 	 s 	 	or	man	-	 year 	 s 	 	are	 waste 	 d 	 	,	just	like	i	 waste 	 d 	 	a	day	.
if	you	just	 multi 	 ply 	 	by	100	million	people	,	let	's	say	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	one	day	a	month	,	 what 	 ever 	 	,	and	you	see	a	vast	amount	of	resource	 waste 	 d 	 	.
and	after	all	,	poor	 count 	 ries 	 	,	like	rich	 count 	 ries 	 	,	one	thing	we	've	got	equal	,	is	 the 	 ir 	 	 day 	 s 	 	are	the	same	length	:	24	 hour 	 s 	 	.
so	if	you	lose	that	precious	resource	,	where	you	are	 some 	 what 	 	equal	to	the	 rich 	 er 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	that	's	a	huge	waste	.
so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	looking	for	any	evidence	that	--	 do 	 es 	 	 connect 	 ivity 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 in 	 crease 	 	 product 	 ivity 	 	?
and	i	could	n't	find	much	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	but	i	found	 th 	 is 	 	graph	 produce 	 d 	 	by	the	itu	,	which	is	the	 inter 	 national 	 	telecommunication	 un 	 ion 	 	,	based	in	geneva	.
they	show	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	.
that	you	see	,	the	 horizon 	 tal 	 	axis	is	where	you	place	your	country	.
so	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	or	the	uk	would	be	here	,	 out 	 side 	 	.
and	so	the	impact	of	one	new	 tele 	 phone 	 	,	which	is	on	the	 vert 	 ical 	 	axis	,	is	 ver 	 y 	 	little	.
but	if	you	come	back	to	a	 poor 	 er 	 	country	,	where	the	gnp	per	capita	is	,	let	's	say	,	500	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	or	300	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	then	the	impact	is	huge	:	6,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	.	or	5,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
the	question	was	,	how	much	did	it	cost	to	install	a	new	 tele 	 phone 	 	in	bangladesh	?
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	:	2,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
so	if	you	 s 	 pend 	 	2,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	and	let	's	say	the	 tele 	 phone 	 	 last 	 s 	 	10	 year 	 s 	 	,
and	if	5,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	every	year	--	so	that	's	50,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
so	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	gadget	to	have	.
and	of	course	,	if	the	cost	of	 install 	 ing 	 	a	 tele 	 phone 	 	is	going	down	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	a	digital	revolution	going	on	,	then	it	would	be	even	more	 dramat 	 ic 	 	.
and	i	 k 	 new 	 	a	little	 economic 	 s 	 	by	then	--	it	 say 	 s 	 	adam	smith	taught	us	that	 special 	 ization 	 	 lead 	 s 	 	to	 product 	 ivity 	 	.
but	how	would	you	 special 	 ize 	 	?
let	's	say	i	'm	a	 fish 	 er 	 man 	 	and	a	 farm 	 er 	 	.
and	chris	is	a	 fish 	 er 	 man 	 	 farm 	 er 	 	.	both	are	 general 	 ists 	 	.
so	the	point	is	that	we	could	 on 	 ly 	 	--	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	we	could	depend	on	each	other	,	is	if	we	can	connect	with	each	other	.
and	if	we	are	 neighbor 	 s 	 	,	i	could	just	walk	over	to	his	house	.
but	then	we	are	 limit 	 ing 	 	our	economic	sphere	to	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	small	area	.
but	in	order	to	expand	that	,	you	need	a	river	,	or	you	need	a	 high 	 way 	 	,	or	you	need	 tele 	 phone 	 	lines	.
but	in	any	event	,	it	's	 connect 	 ivity 	 	that	 lead 	 s 	 	to	dependability	.
and	that	 lead 	 s 	 	to	 special 	 ization 	 	.
that	 lead 	 s 	 	to	 product 	 ivity 	 	.
so	the	question	was	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	looking	at	 th 	 is 	 	issue	,	and	going	back	and	forth	between	bangladesh	and	new	york	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	a	lot	of	 reason 	 s 	 	people	told	me	why	we	do	n't	have	 en 	 ough 	 	 tele 	 phone 	 s 	 	.
and	one	of	them	is	the	 lack 	 ing 	 	 buy 	 ing 	 	power	.
poor	people	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	do	n't	have	the	power	to	buy	.
but	the	point	is	,	if	it	's	a	production	tool	,	why	do	we	have	to	worry	about	that	?
i	mean	,	in	america	,	people	buy	 car 	 s 	 	,	and	they	put	 ver 	 y 	 	little	money	down	.
they	get	a	car	,	and	they	go	to	work	.
the	work	 pay 	 s 	 	them	a	 s 	 al 	 ary 	 	;	the	 s 	 al 	 ary 	 	 allow 	 s 	 	them	to	pay	for	the	car	over	time	.
the	car	 pay 	 s 	 	for	 it 	 self 	 	.
so	if	the	 tele 	 phone 	 	is	a	production	tool	,	then	we	do	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	have	to	worry	about	the	 pur 	 chasing 	 	power	.
and	of	course	,	even	if	that	's	true	,	then	what	about	 initi 	 al 	 	 buy 	 ing 	 	power	?
so	then	the	question	is	,	why	ca	n't	we	have	some	kind	of	 share 	 d 	 	access	?
in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	we	have	--	 every 	 body 	 	 need 	 s 	 	a	 bank 	 ing 	 	service	,	but	 ver 	 y 	 	few	of	us	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	buy	a	bank	.
so	it	's	--	a	bank	 tend 	 s 	 	to	serve	a	whole	community	.
so	we	could	do	that	for	 tele 	 phone 	 s 	 	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	people	told	me	that	we	have	a	lot	of	 import 	 ant 	 	 prim 	 ary 	 	 need 	 s 	 	to	meet	:	food	,	 cloth 	 ing 	 	,	shelter	,	 what 	 ever 	 	.
but	 aga 	 in 	 	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	paternalistic	.
you	should	be	raising	income	and	let	people	decide	what	they	want	to	do	with	 the 	 ir 	 	money	.
but	the	real	problem	is	the	lack	of	other	 infra 	 structure 	 s 	 	.
see	,	you	need	some	kind	of	 infra 	 structure 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	a	new	thing	.
for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	the	 inter 	 net 	 	was	 boom 	 ing 	 	in	the	u.s.	 be 	 cause 	 	there	 we 	 re 	 	--	there	 we 	 re 	 	people	who	had	 computer 	 s 	 	.
they	had	modems	.
they	had	 tele 	 phone 	 	lines	,	so	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	to	 br 	 ing 	 	in	a	new	idea	,	like	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
but	that	's	what	's	 lack 	 ing 	 	in	a	poor	country	.
so	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	we	did	n't	have	ways	to	have	credit	 check 	 s 	 	,	few	 bank 	 s 	 	to	collect	 bill 	 s 	 	,	etc	.
but	that	's	why	i	 notice 	 d 	 	grameen	bank	,	which	is	a	bank	for	poor	people	,	and	had	1,100	 branch 	 es 	 	,	12,000	 employ 	 ees 	 	,	2.3	million	 borrow 	 ers 	 	.
and	they	had	these	 branch 	 es 	 	.
i	thought	i	could	put	cell	 tower 	 s 	 	and	create	a	network	.
and	 any 	 way 	 	,	to	cut	the	time	short	--	so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	--	i	first	went	to	them	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	i	could	connect	all	your	 branch 	 es 	 	and	make	you	more	efficient	.	``
but	you	know	,	they	have	,	after	all	,	 evolv 	 ed 	 	in	a	country	 with 	 out 	 	 tele 	 phone 	 s 	 	,	so	they	are	 de 	 central 	 ized 	 	.	i	mean	,	of	course	there	might	be	other	good	 reason 	 s 	 	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	was	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	--	they	had	to	be	.
and	so	they	 we 	 re 	 	not	that	 interest 	 ed 	 	to	connect	all	 the 	 ir 	 	 branch 	 es 	 	,	and	then	to	be	--	and	rock	the	boat	.
so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 focus 	 ing 	 	.	what	is	it	that	they	 re 	 ally 	 	do	?
so	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	that	 some 	 body 	 	 borrow 	 s 	 	money	from	the	bank	.
she	 typical 	 ly 	 	 buy 	 s 	 	a	cow	.	the	cow	 give 	 s 	 	milk	.
and	she	 sell 	 s 	 	the	milk	to	the	 village 	 rs 	 	,	and	 pay 	 s 	 	off	the	loan	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	business	for	her	,	but	it	's	milk	for	 every 	 body 	 	else	.
and	 sudden 	 ly 	 	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	a	cell	phone	could	be	a	cow	.
 be 	 cause 	 	some	way	she	could	borrow	200	 dollar 	 s 	 	from	the	bank	,	get	a	phone	and	have	the	phone	for	 every 	 body 	 	.
and	it	's	a	business	for	her	.
so	i	wrote	to	the	bank	,	and	they	thought	for	a	while	,	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	it	's	a	little	crazy	,	but	logical	.
if	you	think	it	can	be	 d 	 one 	 	,	come	and	make	it	happen	.	``
so	i	quit	my	job	;	i	went	back	to	bangladesh	.
i	 create 	 d 	 	a	company	in	america	 call 	 ed 	 	gonofone	,	which	in	bengali	 mean 	 s 	 	``	people	's	phone	.	``
and	angel	 invest 	 ors 	 	in	america	put	in	money	 in 	 to 	 	that	.
i	flew	around	the	world	.
after	about	a	million	--	i	mean	,	i	got	 reject 	 ed 	 	from	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 place 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	go	to	a	poor	country	,	i	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	go	to	the	poor	of	the	poor	country	.
after	about	a	million	 mile 	 s 	 	,	and	a	 meaning 	 ful 	 	--	a	 sub 	 stantial 	 	loss	of	hair	,	i	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	put	together	a	 con 	 sort 	 ium 	 	,	and	--	which	 involve 	 d 	 	the	norwegian	 tele 	 phone 	 	company	,	which	 provide 	 d 	 	the	know	-	how	,	and	the	grameen	bank	 provide 	 d 	 	the	 infra 	 structure 	 	to	spread	the	service	.
to	make	the	story	short	,	here	is	the	 cover 	 age 	 	of	the	country	.
you	can	see	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 cover 	 ed 	 	.
even	in	bangladesh	,	there	are	some	empty	 place 	 s 	 	.
but	we	are	 al 	 so 	 	 invest 	 ing 	 	around	 an 	 other 	 	300	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	to	extend	that	 cover 	 age 	 	.
now	,	about	that	cow	model	i	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	.
there	are	about	115,000	people	who	are	 re 	 tail 	 ing 	 	 tele 	 phone 	 	 service 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 neighbor 	 hood 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	 serv 	 ing 	 	52,000	 village 	 s 	 	,	which	represent	about	80	million	people	.
and	these	 phone 	 s 	 	are	generating	about	100	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	for	the	company	.
and	two	 dollar 	 s 	 	profit	per	entrepreneur	per	day	,	which	is	like	700	 dollar 	 s 	 	per	year	.
and	of	course	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 benefici 	 al 	 	in	a	lot	of	ways	.
it	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	income	,	 improve 	 s 	 	 wel 	 fare 	 	,	etc	.
and	the	result	is	,	right	now	,	 th 	 is 	 	company	is	the	largest	 tele 	 phone 	 	company	,	with	3.5	million	 sub 	 scribe 	 rs 	 	,
115,000	of	these	 phone 	 s 	 	i	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	--	that	 produce 	 s 	 	about	a	third	of	the	traffic	in	the	network	.
and	2004	,	the	net	profit	,	after	 tax 	 es 	 	--	 ver 	 y 	 	serious	 tax 	 es 	 	--	was	120	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
and	the	company	 con 	 tribute 	 d 	 	about	190	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	the	government	coffers	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	here	are	some	of	the	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	.
``	the	government	 need 	 s 	 	to	provide	 economic 	 ally 	 	 vi 	 able 	 	 service 	 s 	 	.	``
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 in 	 stance 	 	where	private	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	can	provide	that	.
``	 government 	 s 	 	need	to	subsidize	private	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	some	people	think	.
