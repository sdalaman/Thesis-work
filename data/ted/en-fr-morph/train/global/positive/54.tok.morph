i	'm	going	to	take	you	on	a	journey	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
to	explain	the	wish	,	i	'm	going	to	have	to	take	you	 some 	 where 	 	which	 man 	 y 	 	people	have	n't	 be 	 en 	 	,	and	that	's	around	the	world	.
when	i	was	about	24	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	kate	store	and	 my 	 self 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	an	 organ 	 ization 	 	to	get	 architect 	 s 	 	and	 design 	 ers 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 human 	 itarian 	 	work	.
not	 on 	 ly 	 	about	 respond 	 ing 	 	to	natural	 disaster 	 s 	 	,	but	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 system 	 ic 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	.
we	 believ 	 ed 	 	that	where	the	 resource 	 s 	 	and	 expert 	 ise 	 	are	scarce	,	 innov 	 ative 	 	,	 sustain 	 able 	 	design	can	 re 	 ally 	 	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	people	's	 live 	 s 	 	.
so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	my	life	 a 	 s 	 	an	architect	,	or	training	 a 	 s 	 	an	architect	,	and	i	was	 al 	 ways 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 social 	 ly 	 	 respons 	 ible 	 	design	,	and	how	you	can	 re 	 ally 	 	make	an	impact	.
but	when	i	went	to	 architect 	 ural 	 	school	,	it	 seem 	 ed 	 	that	i	was	the	black	sheep	in	the	family	.
 man 	 y 	 	 architect 	 s 	 	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	think	that	when	you	design	,	you	design	a	jewel	,	and	it	's	a	jewel	that	you	try	and	 crav 	 e 	 	for	.
 where 	 a 	 s 	 	i	felt	that	when	you	design	,	you	either	improve	or	you	create	a	 detri 	 ment 	 	to	the	community	in	which	you	're	 design 	 ing 	 	in	.
so	you	're	not	just	 do 	 ing 	 	a	building	for	the	 resident 	 s 	 	or	for	the	people	who	are	going	to	use	it	,	but	for	the	community	 a 	 s 	 	a	whole	.
and	in	1999	,	we	 start 	 ed 	 	by	 respond 	 ing 	 	to	the	issue	of	the	housing	crisis	for	 return 	 ing 	 	 refuge 	 es 	 	in	kosovo	and	i	did	n't	know	what	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	;	like	i	say	,	mid	-	20s	,	and	i	'm	the	,	i	'm	the	 inter 	 net 	 	generation	,	so	we	 start 	 ed 	 	a	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
we	put	a	call	out	there	,	and	to	my	surprise	in	a	couple	of	 month 	 s 	 	we	had	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 ent 	 ries 	 	from	around	the	world	.
that	led	to	a	number	of	 prototype 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	built	and	 re 	 ally 	 	 experiment 	 ing 	 	with	some	 idea 	 s 	 	.
two	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	a	project	on	 develop 	 ing 	 	mobile	health	 clinic 	 s 	 	in	sub	-	saharan	africa	,	 respond 	 ing 	 	to	the	hiv	/	 aid 	 s 	 	 pan 	 demic 	 	.
that	led	to	550	 ent 	 ries 	 	from	53	 count 	 ries 	 	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	have	 design 	 ers 	 	from	around	the	world	that	 particip 	 ate 	 	.
and	we	had	an	exhibit	of	work	that	 follow 	 ed 	 	that	.
2004	was	the	 tip 	 ping 	 	point	for	us	.
we	 start 	 ed 	 	 respond 	 ing 	 	to	natural	 disaster 	 s 	 	and	 get 	 ting 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	iran	and	 b 	 am 	 	,	 al 	 so 	 	 follow 	 ing 	 	up	on	our	work	in	africa	.
 work 	 ing 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	most	people	look	at	poverty	and	they	see	the	face	of	a	 foreign 	 er 	 	,	but	go	live	--	i	live	in	bozeman	,	montana	--	go	up	to	the	north	 plain 	 s 	 	on	the	 reservation 	 s 	 	,	or	go	down	to	alabama	or	mississippi	pre	-	katrina	,	and	i	could	have	 show 	 n 	 	you	 place 	 s 	 	that	have	far	 wo 	 rse 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	than	 man 	 y 	 	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	to	.
so	we	got	 involve 	 d 	 	in	and	 work 	 ed 	 	in	inner	cities	and	 else 	 where 	 	.
and	then	 al 	 so 	 	i	will	go	 in 	 to 	 	some	more	 project 	 s 	 	.
2005	mother	nature	 kick 	 ed 	 	our	arse	.
i	think	we	can	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 assum 	 e 	 	that	2005	was	a	 horr 	 ific 	 	year	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	natural	 disaster 	 s 	 	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	and	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 connect 	 ions 	 	to	 blog 	 s 	 	and	so	forth	,	 with 	 in 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	 hour 	 s 	 	of	the	tsunami	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	raising	 fund 	 s 	 	,	 get 	 ting 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	,	 work 	 ing 	 	with	people	on	the	ground	.
we	run	from	a	couple	of	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	in	the	first	couple	of	 day 	 s 	 	,	i	had	4,000	 email 	 s 	 	from	people	 need 	 ing 	 	help	.
so	we	 beg 	 an 	 	to	get	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 project 	 s 	 	there	,	and	i	'll	talk	about	some	 other 	 s 	 	.
and	then	of	course	,	 th 	 is 	 	year	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 respond 	 ing 	 	to	katrina	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 follow 	 ing 	 	up	on	our	 re 	 construction 	 	 work 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	brief	 over 	 view 	 	.
in	2004	,	i	 re 	 ally 	 	could	n't	manage	the	number	of	people	who	 want 	 ed 	 	to	help	,	or	the	number	of	 request 	 s 	 	that	i	was	 get 	 ting 	 	.
it	was	all	coming	 in 	 to 	 	my	 lap 	 top 	 	and	cell	phone	.
so	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	embrace	an	open	source	model	of	business	--	that	 any 	 one 	 	,	 any 	 where 	 	in	the	world	,	could	start	a	local	chapter	,	and	they	can	get	 involve 	 d 	 	in	local	 problem 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	 believ 	 e 	 	there	is	no	 s 	 uch 	 	thing	 a 	 s 	 	utopia	.
all	 problem 	 s 	 	are	local	.	all	 solution 	 s 	 	are	local	.
so	,	and	that	 mean 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	 some 	 body 	 	who	is	based	in	mississippi	 know 	 s 	 	more	about	mississippi	than	i	do	.	so	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	is	,	we	used	meetup	and	all	these	other	kind	of	 inter 	 net 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	,	and	we	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 hav 	 ing 	 	40	 chapter 	 s 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	up	,	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 architect 	 s 	 	in	104	 count 	 ries 	 	.
so	the	bullet	point	--	sorry	,	i	never	do	a	suit	,	so	i	 k 	 new 	 	that	i	was	going	to	take	 th 	 is 	 	off	.
ok	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	going	to	do	it	 ver 	 y 	 	quick	.
so	in	the	past	seven	 year 	 s 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	just	about	 non 	 profit 	 	.
what	it	 show 	 ed 	 	me	is	that	there	's	a	 grass 	 root 	 s 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	going	on	of	 social 	 ly 	 	 respons 	 ible 	 	 design 	 ers 	 	who	 re 	 ally 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	world	 ha 	 s 	 	got	a	lot	 small 	 er 	 	,	and	that	we	have	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	--	not	the	 respons 	 ibility 	 	,	but	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	--	to	 re 	 ally 	 	get	 involve 	 d 	 	in	making	change	.
i	'm	 add 	 ing 	 	that	to	my	time	.
so	what	you	do	n't	know	is	,	we	've	got	these	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 design 	 ers 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	around	the	world	,	 connect 	 ed 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	by	a	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	and	we	have	a	staff	of	three	.
by	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	,	the	fact	that	 no 	 body 	 	told	us	we	could	n't	do	it	,	we	did	it	.	and	so	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	to	be	 s 	 aid 	 	about	 naive 	 te 	 	.
so	seven	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	we	've	 develop 	 ed 	 	so	that	we	've	got	 advoc 	 acy 	 	,	 in 	 stig 	 ation 	 	and	 implement 	 ation 	 	.	we	 advoc 	 ate 	 	for	good	design	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	through	student	 work 	 shop 	 s 	 	and	 lectur 	 es 	 	and	public	 forum 	 s 	 	,	op	-	eds	;	we	have	a	book	on	 human 	 itarian 	 	work	;	but	 al 	 so 	 	disaster	 mitig 	 ation 	 	and	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	public	policy	.
we	can	talk	about	fema	,	but	that	's	 an 	 other 	 	talk	.
 in 	 stig 	 ation 	 	,	 develop 	 ing 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	with	 commun 	 ities 	 	and	ngos	 do 	 ing 	 	open	-	source	design	 com 	 petition 	 s 	 	.
 refer 	 ring 	 	,	 match 	 making 	 	with	 commun 	 ities 	 	and	then	 implement 	 ing 	 	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	out	there	and	 do 	 ing 	 	the	work	,	 be 	 cause 	 	when	you	invent	,	it	's	never	a	 re 	 ality 	 	 un 	 til 	 	it	's	built	.
so	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	that	if	we	're	 design 	 ing 	 	and	 try 	 ing 	 	to	create	change	,	we	build	that	change	.
so	here	's	a	select	number	of	 project 	 s 	 	.
kosovo	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	kosovo	in	'99	.	we	did	an	open	design	 com 	 petition 	 	,	like	i	 s 	 aid 	 	.	it	led	to	a	whole	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 idea 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	was	n't	about	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	shelter	,	but	 transit 	 ional 	 	shelter	that	would	last	five	to	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	that	would	be	 place 	 d 	 	next	to	the	land	the	resident	lived	in	,	and	that	they	would	 re 	 build 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	home	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	n't	 im 	 posing 	 	an	 architect 	 ure 	 	on	a	community	;	 th 	 is 	 	was	giving	them	the	 tool 	 s 	 	and	,	and	the	space	to	allow	them	to	 re 	 build 	 	and	 re 	 grow 	 	the	way	they	want	to	.
we	have	from	the	 sub 	 lime 	 	to	the	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	,	but	they	 work 	 ed 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 infla 	 table 	 	 hem 	 p 	 	house	.	it	was	built	;	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ship 	 ping 	 	 contain 	 er 	 	.	built	and	 work 	 s 	 	.
and	a	whole	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 idea 	 s 	 	that	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 deal 	 t 	 	with	 architect 	 ural 	 	building	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	the	 issue 	 s 	 	of	 govern 	 ance 	 	and	the	idea	of	creating	 commun 	 ities 	 	through	complex	 network 	 s 	 	.
so	we	've	 engag 	 ed 	 	not	just	 design 	 ers 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	,	you	know	,	a	whole	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	technology	-	based	 professional 	 s 	 	.
using	 rub 	 ble 	 	from	 destroy 	 ed 	 	 home 	 s 	 	to	create	new	 home 	 s 	 	.
using	straw	bale	construction	,	creating	heat	 wall 	 s 	 	.
and	then	 some 	 thing 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	'99	.
we	went	to	africa	,	 original 	 ly 	 	to	look	at	the	housing	issue	.
 with 	 in 	 	three	 day 	 s 	 	,	we	 real 	 ized 	 	the	problem	was	not	housing	;	it	was	the	growing	 pan 	 demic 	 	of	hiv	/	 aid 	 s 	 	.
and	it	was	n't	 doctor 	 s 	 	 tell 	 ing 	 	us	 th 	 is 	 	;	it	was	actual	 village 	 rs 	 	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 stay 	 ing 	 	with	.
and	so	we	came	up	with	the	bright	idea	that	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 get 	 ting 	 	people	to	walk	10	,	15	 kilometer 	 s 	 	to	see	 doctor 	 s 	 	,	you	get	the	 doctor 	 s 	 	to	the	people	.
and	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 engag 	 ing 	 	the	medical	community	.
and	i	thought	,	you	know	,	we	thought	we	 we 	 re 	 	real	bright	,	you	know	,	 spark 	 s 	 	--	we	've	come	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	great	idea	,	mobile	health	 clinic 	 s 	 	 wide 	 ly 	 	 distribut 	 ed 	 	 through 	 out 	 	sub	-	saharan	africa	.
and	the	community	,	the	medical	community	there	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	've	 s 	 aid 	 	 th 	 is 	 	for	the	last	decade	.	we	know	 th 	 is 	 	.
we	just	do	n't	know	how	to	show	 th 	 is 	 	.	``	so	in	a	way	,	we	had	taken	a	pre	-	 exist 	 ing 	 	need	and	 show 	 n 	 	 solution 	 s 	 	.
and	so	 aga 	 in 	 	,	we	had	a	whole	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 idea 	 s 	 	that	came	in	.
 th 	 is 	 	one	i	 personal 	 ly 	 	love	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	idea	that	 architect 	 ure 	 	is	not	just	about	 solution 	 s 	 	,	but	about	raising	 aware 	 ness 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ken 	 af 	 	clinic	.	you	get	seed	and	you	grow	it	in	a	plot	of	land	,	and	then	once	--	and	it	 grow 	 s 	 	14	feet	in	a	month	.
and	on	the	fourth	week	,	the	 doctor 	 s 	 	come	and	they	mow	out	an	area	,	put	a	 ten 	 s 	 ile 	 	structure	on	the	top	and	when	the	 doctor 	 s 	 	have	 finish 	 ed 	 	 treat 	 ing 	 	and	 see 	 ing 	 	 patient 	 s 	 	and	 village 	 rs 	 	,	you	cut	down	the	clinic	and	you	eat	it	.	it	's	an	eat	your	own	clinic	.
so	it	's	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	the	fact	that	if	you	have	 aid 	 s 	 	,	you	 al 	 so 	 	need	to	have	nutrition	rates	,	and	the	idea	that	the	idea	of	nutrition	is	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	anti	-	retrovirals	out	there	.
so	you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	serious	solution	.
 th 	 is 	 	one	i	love	.	the	idea	is	it	's	not	just	a	clinic	--	it	's	a	community	center	.
 th 	 is 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	at	setting	up	trade	 route 	 s 	 	and	economic	 engine 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	community	,	so	it	can	be	a	self	-	 sustain 	 ing 	 	project	.
every	one	of	these	 project 	 s 	 	is	 sustain 	 able 	 	.
that	's	not	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	a	tree	-	 hugg 	 ing 	 	green	person	.
it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	when	you	live	on	four	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	day	,	you	're	living	on	 surviv 	 al 	 	and	you	have	to	be	 sustain 	 able 	 	.
you	have	to	know	where	your	energy	is	coming	from	.
you	have	to	know	where	your	resource	is	coming	from	.
and	you	have	to	keep	the	maintenance	down	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	about	 get 	 ting 	 	an	economic	engine	,	and	then	at	night	it	 turn 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	movie	theater	.
so	it	's	not	an	 aid 	 s 	 	clinic	.	it	's	a	community	center	.
so	you	can	see	 idea 	 s 	 	.	and	these	 idea 	 s 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 prototype 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	built	.	and	 current 	 ly 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	year	,	there	are	 clinic 	 s 	 	 roll 	 ing 	 	out	in	nigeria	and	kenya	.
from	that	we	 al 	 so 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	siyathemba	,	which	was	a	project	--	the	community	came	to	us	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	the	problem	is	that	the	 girl 	 s 	 	do	n't	have	education	.
and	we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	in	an	area	where	young	women	between	the	 age 	 s 	 	of	16	and	24	have	a	50	percent	hiv	/	 aid 	 s 	 	rate	.	and	that	's	not	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 promisc 	 uous 	 	,	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	no	knowledge	.
and	so	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	look	at	the	idea	of	 s 	 port 	 s 	 	and	create	a	youth	 s 	 port 	 s 	 	center	that	 double 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	hiv	/	 aid 	 s 	 	 out 	 reach 	 	center	,	and	the	 coach 	 es 	 	of	the	 girl 	 s 	 	'	team	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 so 	 	trained	 doctor 	 s 	 	.
so	that	there	would	be	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 low 	 	way	of	 develop 	 ing 	 	kind	of	confidence	in	health	care	.
and	we	 pick 	 ed 	 	nine	 final 	 ists 	 	,	and	then	 t 	 hose 	 	nine	 final 	 ists 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 distribut 	 ed 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	entire	region	,	and	then	the	community	 pick 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	design	.
they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	our	design	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	not	 on 	 ly 	 	about	 engag 	 ing 	 	a	community	;	it	's	about	 empower 	 ing 	 	a	community	and	about	 get 	 ting 	 	them	to	be	a	part	of	the	 re 	 building 	 	process	.
so	the	winning	design	is	here	,	and	then	of	course	,	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	go	and	work	with	the	community	and	the	 client 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 design 	 er 	 	.	he	's	out	there	 work 	 ing 	 	with	the	first	ever	women	's	soccer	team	in	kwa	-	zulu	natal	,	siyathemba	,	and	they	can	tell	it	better	.
video	:	well	,	my	name	is	sisi	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	work	at	the	african	center	.
i	'm	a	 consult 	 ant 	 	and	i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	the	national	 foot 	 ball 	 	player	for	south	africa	,	bafana	bafana	,	and	i	 al 	 so 	 	play	in	the	vodacom	league	for	the	team	 call 	 ed 	 	tembisa	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	now	 change 	 d 	 	to	siyathemba	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	our	home	ground	.
cameron	sinclair	:	so	i	'm	going	to	show	that	 lat 	 er 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	running	out	of	time	.
i	can	see	chris	looking	at	me	 s 	 ly 	 ly 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	 connect 	 ion 	 	,	just	a	 meet 	 ing 	 	with	 some 	 body 	 	who	 want 	 ed 	 	to	develop	africa	's	first	 tele 	 medicine 	 	center	,	in	tanzania	.	and	we	met	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	a	couple	of	 month 	 s 	 	ago	.	we	've	 al 	 ready 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	design	,	and	the	team	is	over	there	,	 work 	 ing 	 	in	 partner 	 ship 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	 match 	 making 	 	 thank 	 s 	 	to	a	couple	of	tedsters	:	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	cheryl	heller	and	andrew	zolli	,	who	 connect 	 ed 	 	me	with	 th 	 is 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	african	woman	.
and	we	start	construction	in	june	,	and	it	will	be	 open 	 ed 	 	by	tedglobal	.
so	when	you	come	to	tedglobal	,	you	can	check	it	out	.
but	what	we	're	known	 prob 	 ably 	 	most	for	is	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	 disaster 	 s 	 	and	 develop 	 ment 	 	,	and	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	a	lot	of	 issue 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	tsunami	and	 al 	 so 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	hurricane	katrina	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	370	-	dollar	shelter	that	can	be	 eas 	 ily 	 	 assemble 	 d 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is
a	community	-	designed	community	center	.
and	what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	is	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	live	and	work	with	the	community	,	and	they	're	part	of	the	design	process	.
the	 kid 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	 involve 	 d 	 	in	mapping	out	where	the	community	center	should	be	,	and	then	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	the	community	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	through	 skill 	 s 	 	training	,	end	up	building	the	building	with	us	.
here	is	 an 	 other 	 	school	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	the	u.n.	 g 	 ave 	 	these	 guy 	 s 	 	for	six	 month 	 s 	 	--	12	plastic	 tarp 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	in	august	.	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	 re 	 placement 	 	,	and	it	's	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	last	for	two	 year 	 s 	 	.
when	the	rain	 come 	 s 	 	down	,	you	ca	n't	hear	a	thing	,	and	in	the	summer	it	's	about	140	 degree 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	.
so	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	if	the	rain	's	coming	down	,	let	's	get	fresh	water	.
so	every	one	of	our	 school 	 s 	 	have	rain	water	 collect 	 ion 	 	 system 	 s 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	low	cost	.
a	class	,	three	 class 	 rooms 	 	and	 rain 	 water 	 	 collect 	 ion 	 	is	5,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	raised	by	hot	chocolate	 sale 	 s 	 	in	atlanta	.
it	's	built	by	the	 parent 	 s 	 	of	the	 kid 	 s 	 	.
the	 kid 	 s 	 	are	out	there	on	-	 s 	 ite 	 	,	building	the	 building 	 s 	 	.
and	it	 open 	 ed 	 	a	couple	of	 week 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	there	's	600	 kid 	 s 	 	that	are	now	using	the	 school 	 s 	 	.
so	,	disaster	 hit 	 s 	 	home	.
we	see	the	bad	 st 	 ories 	 	on	cnn	and	fox	and	all	that	,	but	we	do	n't	see	the	good	 st 	 ories 	 	.
here	is	a	community	that	got	together	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	no	to	 wait 	 ing 	 	.
they	 form 	 ed 	 	a	 partner 	 ship 	 	,	a	 divers 	 e 	 	 partner 	 ship 	 	of	 player 	 s 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	map	out	east	biloxi	,	to	figure	out	who	is	 get 	 ting 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	.
we	've	had	over	1,500	 volunteer 	 s 	 	 re 	 building 	 	,	 rehab 	 bing 	 	 home 	 s 	 	.
 figur 	 ing 	 	out	what	fema	 regulat 	 ions 	 	are	,	not	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	them	to	 dict 	 ate 	 	to	us	how	you	should	 re 	 build 	 	.

 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 rehab 	 bed 	 	home	,	 d 	 one 	 	in	four	 day 	 s 	 	.

600	 buck 	 s 	 	,	 happen 	 ed 	 	two	 day 	 s 	 	ago	.
we	put	together	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	a	 wash 	 room 	 	.

that	was	 the 	 ir 	 	home	,	and	these	are	the	 photograph 	 s 	 	they	took	.
and	we	're	 help 	 ing 	 	,	 work 	 ing 	 	with	them	to	create	a	new	building	.

why	do	n't	aid	 age 	 ncies 	 	do	 th 	 is 	 	?	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	u.n.	tent	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	new	u.n.	tent	,	just	 introduc 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	.

it	took	20	 year 	 s 	 	to	design	 th 	 is 	 	and	get	it	 implement 	 ed 	 	in	the	field	.
i	was	12	 year 	 s 	 	old	.	there	's	a	problem	here	.
 luck 	 ily 	 	,	we	're	not	 al 	 one 	 	.
there	are	 hundred 	 s 	 	and	 hundred 	 s 	 	and	 hundred 	 s 	 	and	 hundred 	 s 	 	and	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 architect 	 s 	 	and	 design 	 ers 	 	and	 inventor 	 s 	 	around	the	world	that	are	 get 	 ting 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 human 	 itarian 	 	work	.
more	 hem 	 p 	 	 house 	 s 	 	--	it	's	a	theme	in	japan	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	.
i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	what	they	're	 smok 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	grip	clip	designed	by	 some 	 body 	 	who	 s 	 aid 	 	,	all	you	need	is	some	way	to	attach	membrane	 structure 	 s 	 	to	physical	support	 beam 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	guy	designed	for	nasa	,	is	now	 do 	 ing 	 	housing	.
i	'm	going	to	whip	through	 th 	 is 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	know	i	've	got	 on 	 ly 	 	a	couple	of	 minute 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	 d 	 one 	 	in	the	last	two	 year 	 s 	 	.
i	 show 	 ed 	 	you	 some 	 thing 	 	that	took	20	 year 	 s 	 	to	do	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	a	 s 	 election 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	built	in	the	last	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
from	brazil	to	india	,	mexico	,	alabama	,	 chin 	 a 	 	,	israel	,	palestine	,	vietnam	.
the	average	age	of	a	 design 	 er 	 	who	 get 	 s 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	project	is	32	--	that	's	how	old	i	am	.	so	it	's	a	young	--	i	just	have	to	stop	here	,	 be 	 cause 	 	arup	is	in	the	room	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	best	-	designed	toilet	in	the	world	.
if	you	're	ever	,	ever	in	india	,	go	use	 th 	 is 	 	toilet	.
chris	luebkeman	will	tell	you	why	.
i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	that	's	how	he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 s 	 pend 	 	the	party	.	but	the	future	is	not	going	to	be	the	sky	-	 scrap 	 ing 	 	cities	of	new	york	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	.	and	when	you	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	see	crisis	.
what	i	see	is	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 inventor 	 s 	 	.
one	billion	people	live	in	 ab 	 ject 	 	poverty	.
we	hear	about	them	all	the	time	.
four	billion	live	in	growing	but	fragile	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	.
one	in	seven	live	in	 un 	 plan 	 ned 	 	 settle 	 ments 	 	.
if	we	do	 noth 	 ing 	 	about	the	housing	crisis	that	's	about	to	happen	,	in	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	one	in	three	people	will	live	in	an	 un 	 plan 	 ned 	 	 settle 	 ment 	 	or	a	 refuge 	 e 	 	camp	.	look	left	,	look	right	:	one	of	you	will	be	there	.
how	do	we	improve	the	living	 standard 	 s 	 	of	five	billion	people	?
with	10	million	 solution 	 s 	 	.
so	i	wish	to	develop	a	community	that	 active 	 ly 	 	 embrace 	 s 	 	 innov 	 ative 	 	and	 sustain 	 able 	 	design	to	improve	the	living	 condition 	 s 	 	for	 every 	 one 	 	.
chris	anderson	:	wait	a	second	.	wait	a	second	.	that	's	your	wish	?
cs	:	that	's	my	wish	.
ca	:	that	's	his	wish	!
cs	:	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 architect 	 ure 	 	for	 human 	 ity 	 	with	700	 dollar 	 s 	 	and	a	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
so	chris	 some 	 how 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	to	give	me	100,000	.
so	why	not	 th 	 is 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	?
open	-	source	 architect 	 ure 	 	is	the	way	to	go	.
you	have	a	 divers 	 e 	 	community	of	 particip 	 ants 	 	--	and	we	're	not	just	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 inventor 	 s 	 	and	 design 	 ers 	 	,	but	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	 fund 	 ing 	 	model	.
my	role	is	not	 a 	 s 	 	a	 design 	 er 	 	;	it	's	 a 	 s 	 	a	conduit	between	the	design	world	and	the	 human 	 itarian 	 	world	.
and	what	we	need	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 replicate 	 s 	 	me	 global 	 ly 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	have	n't	slept	in	seven	 year 	 s 	 	.
 second 	 ly 	 	,	what	will	 th 	 is 	 	thing	be	?
 design 	 ers 	 	want	to	respond	to	 issue 	 s 	 	of	 human 	 itarian 	 	crisis	,	but	they	do	n't	want	some	company	in	the	west	taking	 the 	 ir 	 	idea	and	 bas 	 ically 	 	 profit 	 ing 	 	from	it	.
so	creative	 common 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	 licens 	 e 	 	.
and	what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	is	that	a	 design 	 er 	 	can	--	the	siyathemba	project	i	 show 	 ed 	 	was	the	first	ever	building	to	have	a	creative	 common 	 s 	 	 licens 	 e 	 	on	it	.
 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	that	is	built	,	 any 	 one 	 	in	africa	or	any	 develop 	 ing 	 	nation	can	take	the	construction	 document 	 s 	 	and	replicate	it	for	free	.
so	why	not	allow	 design 	 ers 	 	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	still	 protect 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 right 	 s 	 	here	?
we	want	to	have	a	community	where	you	can	upload	 idea 	 s 	 	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	can	be	tested	in	 earth 	 quake 	 	,	in	flood	,	in	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	austere	 environment 	 s 	 	.	the	reason	that	's	 import 	 ant 	 	is	i	do	n't	want	to	wait	for	the	next	katrina	to	find	out	if	my	house	 work 	 s 	 	.
that	's	too	late	.	we	need	to	do	it	now	.
so	 do 	 ing 	 	that	 global 	 ly 	 	.
and	i	want	 th 	 is 	 	whole	thing	to	work	multi	-	lingually	.
when	you	look	at	the	face	of	an	architect	,	most	people	think	a	gray	-	haired	white	guy	.
i	do	n't	see	that	.	i	see	the	face	of	the	world	.
so	i	want	 every 	 one 	 	from	all	over	the	planet	,	to	be	able	to	be	a	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	design	and	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
the	idea	of	 need 	 s 	 	-	based	 com 	 petition 	 s 	 	--	x	-	prize	for	the	other	98	percent	,	if	you	want	to	call	it	that	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	want	to	look	at	ways	of	 match 	 making 	 	and	 put 	 ting 	 	 fund 	 ing 	 	 partner 	 s 	 	together	.
and	the	idea	of	 integ 	 rating 	 	 manufactur 	 ers 	 	--	fab	 lab 	 s 	 	in	every	country	.
when	i	hear	about	the	$	100	 lap 	 top 	 	and	it	's	going	to	 educ 	 ate 	 	every	child	--	 educ 	 ate 	 	every	 design 	 er 	 	in	the	world	.	put	one	in	every	favela	,	every	 s 	 lum 	 	 settle 	 ment 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	know	what	,
 innov 	 ation 	 	will	happen	.
and	i	need	to	know	that	.	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	leap	-	back	.
we	talk	about	leapfrog	 techno 	 logies 	 	.	i	write	with	worldchanging	,	and	the	one	thing	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	is	,	i	learn	more	on	the	ground	than	i	've	ever	 learn 	 ed 	 	here	.
so	let	's	take	 t 	 hose 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	,	adapt	them	and	we	can	use	them	.
these	 idea 	 s 	 	are	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	have	 adapt 	 able 	 	;	they	should	have	the	potential	for	evolution	;	they	should	be	 develop 	 ed 	 	by	every	nation	on	the	world	and	 use 	 ful 	 	for	every	nation	on	the	world	.	what	will	it	take	?
there	should	be	a	sheet	.	i	do	n't	have	time	to	read	 th 	 is 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	going	to	be	 yank 	 ed 	 	off	.
ca	:	just	 leav 	 e 	 	it	up	there	for	a	sec	.
cs	:	well	,	what	will	it	take	?	you	 guy 	 s 	 	are	smart	.
so	it	's	going	to	take	a	lot	of	computing	power	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	want	the	idea	that	any	 lap 	 top 	 	 any 	 where 	 	in	the	world	can	plug	 in 	 to 	 	the	system	and	be	able	to	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 particip 	 ate 	 	in	 develop 	 ing 	 	these	 design 	 s 	 	,	but	 util 	 ize 	 	the	 design 	 s 	 	.	 al 	 so 	 	,	a	process	of	 review 	 ing 	 	the	 design 	 s 	 	.
i	want	every	arup	engineer	in	the	world	to	check	and	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	stuff	that	's	 stand 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	are	the	best	in	the	world	.	plug	.
and	so	you	know	,	i	want	these	--	and	i	just	should	note	,	i	have	two	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	and	one	of	them	there	,	is	there	and	that	 ha 	 s 	 	3000	 design 	 s 	 	on	it	.	if	i	drop	that	 lap 	 top 	 	,	what	 happen 	 s 	 	?
so	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	have	these	proven	 idea 	 s 	 	put	up	there	,	easy	to	use	,	easy	to	get	a	hold	of	.
my	mom	once	 s 	 aid 	 	,	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	 wo 	 rse 	 	than	 be 	 ing 	 	all	mouth	and	no	 trou 	 s 	 ers 	 	.
i	'm	fed	up	of	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	making	change	.
you	 on 	 ly 	 	make	it	by	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
we	've	 change 	 d 	 	fema	 guide 	 lines 	 	.	we	've	 change 	 d 	 	public	policy	.
we	've	 change 	 d 	 	 inter 	 national 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	--	based	on	building	 thing 	 s 	 	.
so	for	me	,	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	that	we	create	a	real	conduit	for	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	and	that	it	's	free	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
think	of	free	culture	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	free	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
 some 	 body 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	 th 	 is 	 	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	back	.
i	will	give	 point 	 s 	 	for	 t 	 hose 	 	who	know	it	.	i	think	the	man	was	 may 	 be 	 	25	 year 	 s 	 	too	early	,	so	let	's	do	it	.
