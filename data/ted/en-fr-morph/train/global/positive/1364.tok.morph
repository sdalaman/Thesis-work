which	 mean 	 s 	 	that	,	while	we	all	have	one	 bio 	 graphy 	 	,	they	have	 man 	 y 	 	.
i	want	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	to	talk	about	the	story	,	the	 bio 	 graphy 	 	--	or	 ra 	 ther 	 	the	biographies	--	of	one	 part 	 icular 	 	object	,	one	 remark 	 able 	 	thing	.	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	,	i	agree	,	look	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
it	's	about	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	 rug 	 by 	 	ball	.
it	's	made	of	clay	,	and	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 fashion 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	cylinder	shape	,	 cover 	 ed 	 	with	close	writing	and	then	 bake 	 d 	 	dry	in	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 knock 	 ed 	 	about	a	bit	,	which	is	not	surprising	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	made	two	and	a	half	thousand	 year 	 s 	 	ago	and	was	 d 	 ug 	 	up	in	1879	.
but	 to 	 day 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	thing	is	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	a	major	player	in	the	 politic 	 s 	 	of	the	middle	east	.
and	it	's	an	object	with	 fasci 	 nating 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	and	 st 	 ories 	 	that	are	by	no	 mean 	 s 	 	over	yet	.
the	story	 begin 	 s 	 	in	the	iran	-	 ir 	 aq 	 	war	and	that	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 event 	 s 	 	that	 culmin 	 ated 	 	in	the	invasion	of	 ir 	 aq 	 	by	foreign	 force 	 s 	 	,	the	removal	of	a	 de 	 spot 	 ic 	 	 rul 	 er 	 	and	instant	regime	change	.
and	i	want	to	begin	with	one	episode	from	that	sequence	of	 event 	 s 	 	that	most	of	you	would	be	 ver 	 y 	 	familiar	with	,	belshazzar	's	 f 	 east 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	iran	-	 ir 	 aq 	 	war	of	539	bc	.
and	the	 parallel 	 s 	 	between	the	 event 	 s 	 	of	539	bc	and	2003	and	in	between	are	 start 	 ling 	 	.
what	you	're	looking	at	is	rembrandt	's	 paint 	 ing 	 	,	now	in	the	national	 gall 	 ery 	 	in	london	,	 illustr 	 ating 	 	the	text	from	the	prophet	daniel	in	the	hebrew	 script 	 ures 	 	.
and	you	all	know	 rough 	 ly 	 	the	story	.
belshazzar	,	the	son	of	nebuchadnezzar	,	nebuchadnezzar	who	'd	 conquer 	 ed 	 	israel	,	sacked	jerusalem	and	 capture 	 d 	 	the	people	and	taken	the	jews	back	to	babylon	.
not	 on 	 ly 	 	the	jews	,	he	'd	taken	the	temple	 vessel 	 s 	 	.
he	'd	ransacked	,	desecrated	the	temple	.	and	the	great	gold	 vessel 	 s 	 	of	the	temple	in	jerusalem	had	 be 	 en 	 	taken	to	babylon	.
belshazzar	,	his	son	,	 decide 	 s 	 	to	have	a	 f 	 east 	 	.
and	in	order	to	make	it	even	more	 excit 	 ing 	 	,	he	 add 	 ed 	 	a	bit	of	sacrilege	to	the	rest	of	the	 f 	 un 	 	,	and	he	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	out	the	temple	 vessel 	 s 	 	.
he	's	 al 	 ready 	 	at	war	with	the	iranians	,	with	the	king	of	persia	.
and	that	night	,	daniel	 tell 	 s 	 	us	,	at	the	height	of	the	festivities	a	hand	 appear 	 ed 	 	and	wrote	on	the	wall	,	``	you	are	 weigh 	 ed 	 	in	the	balance	and	found	 want 	 ing 	 	,
and	your	 king 	 dom 	 	is	 hand 	 ed 	 	over	to	the	medes	and	the	persians	.	``	and	that	 ver 	 y 	 	night	cyrus	,	king	of	the	persians	,	 enter 	 ed 	 	babylon	and	the	whole	regime	of	belshazzar	fell	.
it	is	,	of	course	,	a	great	moment	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	the	jewish	people	.
it	's	a	great	story	.	it	's	story	we	all	know	.
``	the	writing	on	the	wall	``	is	part	of	our	 every 	 day 	 	language	.
what	 happen 	 ed 	 	next	was	 remark 	 able 	 	,	and	it	's	where	our	cylinder	 enter 	 s 	 	the	story	.
cyrus	,	king	of	the	persians	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 enter 	 ed 	 	babylon	 with 	 out 	 	a	fight	--	the	great	empire	of	babylon	,	which	ran	from	central	southern	 ir 	 aq 	 	to	the	mediterranean	,	 fall 	 s 	 	to	cyrus	.
and	cyrus	 make 	 s 	 	a	 decla 	 ration 	 	.
and	that	is	what	 th 	 is 	 	cylinder	is	,	the	 decla 	 ration 	 	made	by	the	 rul 	 er 	 	 guide 	 d 	 	by	god	who	had	toppled	the	iraqi	despot	and	was	going	to	 br 	 ing 	 	 free 	 dom 	 	to	the	people	.
in	 ring 	 ing 	 	babylonian	--	it	was	written	in	babylonian	--	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	am	cyrus	,	king	of	all	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	the	great	king	,	the	 power 	 ful 	 	king	,	king	of	babylon	,	king	of	the	four	 quarter 	 s 	 	of	the	world	.	``	they	're	not	 s 	 hy 	 	of	 hyper 	 bo 	 le 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	.

so	the	 hyper 	 bo 	 le 	 	is	not	 actual 	 ly 	 	surprising	.
and	what	is	the	great	king	,	the	 power 	 ful 	 	king	,	the	king	of	the	four	 quarter 	 s 	 	of	the	world	going	to	do	?

he	'll	let	them	return	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	.
and	more	 import 	 ant 	 	,	he	will	let	them	all	 re 	 cover 	 	the	 god 	 s 	 	,	the	 statue 	 s 	 	,	the	temple	 vessel 	 s 	 	that	had	 be 	 en 	 	 confisc 	 ated 	 	.

 th 	 is 	 	is	the	decree	,	 th 	 is 	 	object	is	the	evidence	for	the	fact	that	the	jews	,	after	the	 ex 	 ile 	 	in	babylon	,	the	 year 	 s 	 	they	'd	 s 	 pent 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	by	the	 water 	 s 	 	of	babylon	,	 weep 	 ing 	 	when	they	 remember 	 ed 	 	jerusalem	,	 t 	 hose 	 	jews	 we 	 re 	 	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	go	home	.

 th 	 is 	 	is	the	jewish	version	of	the	same	story	.	``	thus	 s 	 aid 	 	cyrus	,	king	of	persia	,	'	all	the	 king 	 dom 	 s 	 	of	the	earth	have	the	lord	god	of	heaven	 give 	 n 	 	 the 	 e 	 	,	and	he	 ha 	 s 	 	charged	me	to	build	him	a	house	in	jerusalem	.

two	great	 text 	 s 	 	,	what	about	the	 politic 	 s 	 	?
what	was	going	on	was	the	fundamental	shift	in	middle	eastern	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
the	empire	of	iran	,	the	medes	and	the	persians	,	 unit 	 ed 	 	under	cyrus	,	 be 	 came 	 	the	first	great	world	empire	.
cyrus	 begin 	 s 	 	in	the	530s	bc	.
and	by	the	time	of	his	son	darius	,	the	whole	of	the	eastern	mediterranean	is	under	persian	control	.
 th 	 is 	 	empire	is	,	in	fact	,	the	middle	east	 a 	 s 	 	we	now	know	it	,
and	it	's	what	 shape 	 s 	 	the	middle	east	 a 	 s 	 	we	now	know	it	.
it	was	the	largest	empire	the	world	had	known	 un 	 til 	 	then	.
much	more	 import 	 ant 	 	,	it	was	the	first	 multi 	 cultural 	 	,	multifaith	state	on	a	huge	scale	.
and	it	had	to	be	run	in	a	 quit 	 e 	 	new	way	.
it	had	to	be	run	in	different	 language 	 s 	 	.	the	fact	that	 th 	 is 	 	decree	is	in	babylonian	 say 	 s 	 	one	thing	.
and	it	had	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	different	 habit 	 s 	 	,	different	 people 	 s 	 	,	different	 relig 	 ions 	 	,	different	 faith 	 s 	 	.
all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	are	 respect 	 ed 	 	by	cyrus	.
cyrus	 set 	 s 	 	up	a	model	of	how	you	run	a	great	 multi 	 national 	 	,	multifaith	,	 multi 	 cultural 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	.	and	the	result	of	that	was	an	empire	that	 include 	 d 	 	the	 area 	 s 	 	you	see	on	the	screen	,	and	which	 surviv 	 ed 	 	for	200	 year 	 s 	 	of	 st 	 ability 	 	 un 	 til 	 	it	was	 shatter 	 ed 	 	by	alexander	.
it	left	a	dream	of	the	middle	east	 a 	 s 	 	a	unit	,	and	a	unit	where	people	of	different	 faith 	 s 	 	could	live	together	.
the	greek	 invasion 	 s 	 	 end 	 ed 	 	that	.
and	of	course	,	alexander	could	n't	sustain	a	government	and	it	 fragment 	 ed 	 	.
but	what	cyrus	 represent 	 ed 	 	 remain 	 ed 	 	 absolute 	 ly 	 	central	.
the	greek	historian	xenophon	wrote	his	book	``	cyropaedia	``	promoting	cyrus	 a 	 s 	 	the	great	 rul 	 er 	 	.
and	 through 	 out 	 	european	culture	 after 	 ward 	 	,	cyrus	 remain 	 ed 	 	the	model	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	16th	century	image	to	show	you	how	 wide 	 spread 	 	his	 vene 	 ration 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	was	.
and	xenophon	's	book	on	cyrus	on	how	you	ran	a	 divers 	 e 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	was	one	of	the	great	 text 	 book 	 s 	 	that	inspired	the	 found 	 ing 	 	 father 	 s 	 	of	the	american	revolution	.

 mean 	 while 	 	,	back	in	babylon	,	 thing 	 s 	 	had	not	 be 	 en 	 	going	well	.
after	alexander	,	the	other	 empire 	 s 	 	,	babylon	 decline 	 s 	 	,	 fall 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 ruin 	 s 	 	,	and	all	the	 trace 	 s 	 	of	the	great	babylonian	empire	are	lost	--	 un 	 til 	 	1879	when	the	cylinder	is	 discover 	 ed 	 	by	a	british	museum	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	 dig 	 ging 	 	in	babylon	.
and	it	 enter 	 s 	 	now	 an 	 other 	 	story	.
it	 enter 	 s 	 	that	great	debate	in	the	middle	of	the	19th	century	:	are	the	 script 	 ures 	 	 reli 	 able 	 	?	can	we	trust	them	?
we	 on 	 ly 	 	 k 	 new 	 	about	the	return	of	the	jews	and	the	decree	of	cyrus	from	the	hebrew	 script 	 ures 	 	.
no	other	evidence	.
 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 appear 	 ed 	 	.
and	great	 excit 	 ement 	 	to	a	world	where	 t 	 hose 	 	who	 believ 	 ed 	 	in	the	 script 	 ures 	 	had	had	 the 	 ir 	 	faith	in	creation	shaken	by	evolution	,	by	 geo 	 logy 	 	,	here	was	evidence	that	the	 script 	 ures 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 historic 	 ally 	 	true	.
it	's	a	great	19th	century	moment	.
but	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	,	of	course	,	is	where	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	--	the	 fact 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	true	,	hurrah	for	 archeo 	 logy 	 	,	but	the	 interpret 	 ation 	 	was	 ra 	 ther 	 	more	 complic 	 ated 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	cylinder	account	and	the	hebrew	 b 	 ible 	 	account	differ	in	one	key	respect	.
the	babylonian	cylinder	is	written	by	the	 priest 	 s 	 	of	the	great	god	of	bablyon	,	marduk	.
and	,	not	 surprising 	 ly 	 	,	they	tell	you	that	all	 th 	 is 	 	was	 d 	 one 	 	by	marduk	.
``	marduk	,	we	hold	,	 call 	 ed 	 	cyrus	by	his	name	.	``	marduk	 take 	 s 	 	cyrus	by	the	hand	,	 call 	 s 	 	him	to	shepherd	his	people	and	 give 	 s 	 	him	the	rule	of	babylon	.
marduk	 tell 	 s 	 	cyrus	that	he	will	do	these	great	,	 gen 	 er 	 ous 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	of	setting	the	people	free	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	why	we	should	all	be	 grat 	 e 	 ful 	 	to	and	worship	marduk	.
the	hebrew	 writer 	 s 	 	in	the	old	 test 	 a 	 ment 	 	,	you	will	not	be	 surprise 	 d 	 	to	learn	,	take	a	 ra 	 ther 	 	different	view	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
for	them	,	of	course	,	it	ca	n't	possibly	by	marduk	that	made	all	 th 	 is 	 	happen	.
it	can	 on 	 ly 	 	be	jehovah	.
and	so	in	isaiah	,	we	have	the	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 text 	 s 	 	giving	all	the	credit	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	not	to	marduk	but	to	the	lord	god	of	israel	--	the	lord	god	of	israel	who	 al 	 so 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	cyrus	by	name	,	 al 	 so 	 	 take 	 s 	 	cyrus	by	the	hand	and	 talk 	 s 	 	of	him	 shepherd 	 ing 	 	his	people	.
it	's	a	 remark 	 able 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	two	different	priestly	appropriations	of	the	same	event	,	two	different	religious	takeovers	of	a	 politic 	 al 	 	fact	.
god	,	we	know	,	is	 usual 	 ly 	 	on	the	side	of	the	big	 battalion 	 s 	 	.
the	question	is	,	which	god	was	it	?
and	the	debate	unsettles	 every 	 body 	 	in	the	19th	century	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	the	hebrew	 script 	 ures 	 	are	part	of	a	much	 wide 	 r 	 	world	of	 relig 	 ion 	 	.
and	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	clear	the	cylinder	is	 old 	 er 	 	than	the	text	of	isaiah	,	and	yet	,	jehovah	is	 s 	 peaking 	 	in	 word 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	to	 t 	 hose 	 	used	by	marduk	.
and	there	's	a	 s 	 light 	 	sense	that	isaiah	 know 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	god	 s 	 peaking 	 	,	of	course	,	``	i	have	 call 	 ed 	 	 the 	 e 	 	by	thy	name	 th 	 ough 	 	 th 	 ou 	 	hast	not	known	me	.	``	i	think	it	's	 recogn 	 ized 	 	that	cyrus	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 real 	 ize 	 	that	he	's	 act 	 ing 	 	under	 order 	 s 	 	from	jehovah	.	and	 equal 	 ly 	 	,	he	'd	have	 be 	 en 	 	 surprise 	 d 	 	that	he	was	 act 	 ing 	 	under	 order 	 s 	 	from	marduk	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	of	course	,	cyrus	is	a	good	iranian	with	a	 total 	 ly 	 	different	set	of	 god 	 s 	 	who	are	not	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	in	any	of	these	 text 	 s 	 	.	that	's	1879	.
40	 year 	 s 	 	on	and	we	're	in	1917	,	and	the	cylinder	 enter 	 s 	 	a	different	world	.
 th 	 is 	 	time	,	the	real	 politic 	 s 	 	of	the	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	world	--	the	year	of	the	balfour	 decla 	 ration 	 	,	the	year	when	the	new	imperial	power	in	the	middle	east	,	britain	,	 decide 	 s 	 	that	it	will	declare	a	jewish	national	home	,	it	will	allow	the	jews	to	return	.
and	the	 respons 	 e 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	by	the	jewish	population	in	eastern	europe	is	rhapsodic	.
and	 a 	 cross 	 	eastern	europe	,	jews	 dis 	 play 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	of	cyrus	and	of	george	v	side	by	side	--	the	two	great	 rul 	 ers 	 	who	have	 allow 	 ed 	 	the	return	to	jerusalem	.

you	all	know	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
the	state	of	israel	is	 set 	 up 	 	,	and	50	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	in	the	late	60s	,	it	's	clear	that	britain	's	role	 a 	 s 	 	the	imperial	power	is	over	.
and	 an 	 other 	 	story	of	the	cylinder	 begin 	 s 	 	.

it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	critical	to	find	a	symbol	that	will	pull	together	all	iranians	--	muslims	and	non	-	muslims	,	christians	,	zoroastrians	,	jews	living	in	iran	,	people	who	are	 dev 	 out 	 	,	not	 dev 	 out 	 	.
and	the	obvious	emblem	is	cyrus	.
so	when	the	british	museum	and	tehran	national	musuem	cooperate	and	work	together	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	,	the	iranians	ask	for	one	thing	 on 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	loan	.
it	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	object	they	want	.
they	want	to	borrow	the	cyrus	cylinder	.
and	last	year	,	the	cyrus	cylinder	went	to	tehran	for	the	second	time	.
it	's	 show 	 n 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 present 	 ed 	 	here	,	put	 in 	 to 	 	 it 	 s 	 	case	by	the	director	of	the	national	museum	of	tehran	,	one	of	the	 man 	 y 	 	women	in	iran	in	 ver 	 y 	 	senior	 position 	 s 	 	,	mrs.	ardakani	.
it	was	a	huge	event	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	other	side	of	that	same	picture	.
it	's	 s 	 een 	 	in	tehran	by	between	one	and	two	million	people	in	the	space	of	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	beyond	any	 block 	 buster 	 	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	in	the	west	.
and	it	's	the	subject	of	a	huge	debate	about	what	 th 	 is 	 	cylinder	 mean 	 s 	 	,	what	cyrus	 mean 	 s 	 	,	but	above	all	,	cyrus	 a 	 s 	 	 articulate 	 d 	 	through	 th 	 is 	 	cylinder	--	cyrus	 a 	 s 	 	the	 defend 	 er 	 	of	the	 home 	 land 	 	,	the	champion	,	of	course	,	of	iranian	 ident 	 ity 	 	and	of	the	iranian	 people 	 s 	 	,	 toler 	 ant 	 	of	all	 faith 	 s 	 	.
and	in	the	current	iran	,	zoroastrians	and	christians	have	 guarantee 	 d 	 	 place 	 s 	 	in	the	iranian	parliament	,	 some 	 thing 	 	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	proud	of	.
to	see	 th 	 is 	 	object	in	tehran	,	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	jews	living	in	iran	came	to	tehran	to	see	it	.
it	 be 	 came 	 	a	great	emblem	,	a	great	subject	of	debate	about	what	iran	is	at	home	and	 a 	 broad 	 	.
is	iran	still	to	be	the	 defend 	 er 	 	of	the	 oppress 	 ed 	 	?
will	iran	set	free	the	people	that	the	tyrants	have	 enslave 	 d 	 	and	expropriated	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	 head 	 y 	 	national	rhetoric	,	and	it	was	all	put	together	in	a	great	 page 	 ant 	 	 launch 	 ing 	 	the	return	.
here	you	see	 th 	 is 	 	out	-	sized	cyrus	cylinder	on	the	stage	with	great	 figure 	 s 	 	from	iranian	 histo 	 ry 	 	 gather 	 ing 	 	to	take	 the 	 ir 	 	place	in	the	heritage	of	iran	.	it	was	a	narrative	 present 	 ed 	 	by	the	 p 	 resident 	 	 him 	 self 	 	.
and	for	me	,	to	take	 th 	 is 	 	object	to	iran	,	to	be	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	take	 th 	 is 	 	object	to	iran	was	to	be	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	be	part	of	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	debate	led	at	the	highest	 level 	 s 	 	about	what	iran	is	,	what	different	irans	there	are	and	how	the	different	 histo 	 ries 	 	of	iran	might	shape	the	world	 to 	 day 	 	.
it	's	a	debate	that	's	still	 continu 	 ing 	 	,	and	it	will	 continu 	 e 	 	to	 rum 	 ble 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	object	is	one	of	the	great	 decla 	 ration 	 s 	 	of	a	human	 aspir 	 ation 	 	.
it	 stand 	 s 	 	with	the	american	 constit 	 ution 	 	.
it	 certain 	 ly 	 	 say 	 s 	 	far	more	about	real	 free 	 dom 	 s 	 	than	 magn 	 a 	 	 cart 	 a 	 	.	it	is	a	document	that	can	mean	so	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	for	iran	and	for	the	region	.
a	replica	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	at	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	.	in	new	york	 th 	 is 	 	 aut 	 umn 	 	,	it	will	be	present	when	the	great	 debate 	 s 	 	about	the	future	of	the	middle	east	take	place	.
and	i	want	to	finish	by	 ask 	 ing 	 	you	what	the	next	story	will	be	in	which	 th 	 is 	 	object	 figure 	 s 	 	.
it	will	appear	,	 certain 	 ly 	 	,	in	 man 	 y 	 	more	middle	eastern	 st 	 ories 	 	.
and	what	story	of	the	middle	east	,	what	story	of	the	world	,	do	you	want	to	see	 reflect 	 ing 	 	what	is	 s 	 aid 	 	,	what	is	 express 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	cylinder	?
the	right	of	 people 	 s 	 	to	live	together	in	the	same	state	,	 worship 	 ing 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	,	 free 	 ly 	 	--	a	middle	east	,	a	world	,	in	which	 relig 	 ion 	 	is	not	the	subject	of	division	or	of	debate	.	in	the	world	of	the	middle	east	at	the	moment	,	the	 debate 	 s 	 	are	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	know	,	shrill	.
but	i	think	it	's	possible	that	the	most	 power 	 ful 	 	and	the	 wise 	 st 	 	voice	of	all	of	them	may	well	be	the	voice	of	 th 	 is 	 	mute	thing	,	the	cyrus	cylinder	.
thank	you	.
