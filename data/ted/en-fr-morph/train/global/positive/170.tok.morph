i	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 wait 	 ing 	 	by	the	phone	for	a	call	from	ted	for	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	in	fact	,	in	2000	,	i	was	ready	to	talk	about	ebay	,	but	no	call	.
in	2003	,	i	was	ready	to	do	a	talk	about	the	skoll	 found 	 ation 	 	and	social	 entrepreneur 	 ship 	 	.	no	call	.	in	2004	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 particip 	 ant 	 	 production 	 s 	 	and	we	had	a	 re 	 ally 	 	good	first	year	,	and	no	call	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	i	get	a	call	last	year	,	and	then	i	have	to	go	up	after	j.j.	abrams	.
you	've	got	a	cruel	sense	of	humor	,	ted	.
when	i	first	 move 	 d 	 	to	hollywood	from	silicon	 val 	 ley 	 	,	i	had	some	misgivings	.
but	i	found	that	there	 we 	 re 	 	some	 advantage 	 s 	 	to	 be 	 ing 	 	in	hollywood	.
and	,	in	fact	,	some	 advantage 	 s 	 	to	 own 	 ing 	 	your	own	media	company	.
and	i	 al 	 so 	 	found	that	hollywood	and	silicon	 val 	 ley 	 	have	a	lot	more	in	common	than	i	would	have	 dream 	 ed 	 	.
hollywood	 ha 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 s 	 ex 	 	 symbol 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 val 	 ley 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 s 	 ex 	 	 symbol 	 s 	 	.	hollywood	 ha 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 rival 	 ries 	 	,	and	the	 val 	 ley 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 rival 	 ries 	 	.
hollywood	 gather 	 s 	 	around	power	 table 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 val 	 ley 	 	 gather 	 s 	 	around	power	 table 	 s 	 	.
so	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	there	was	a	lot	more	in	common	than	i	would	have	 dream 	 ed 	 	.
but	i	'm	 actual 	 ly 	 	here	 to 	 day 	 	to	tell	a	story	.
and	part	of	it	is	a	personal	story	.	when	chris	 invit 	 ed 	 	me	to	speak	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	people	think	of	you	 a 	 s 	 	a	bit	of	an	enigma	,	and	they	want	to	know	what	 drive 	 s 	 	you	a	bit	.
and	what	 re 	 ally 	 	 drive 	 s 	 	me	is	a	vision	of	the	future	that	i	think	we	all	share	.
it	's	a	world	of	peace	and	 prosper 	 ity 	 	and	 sustain 	 ability 	 	.
and	when	we	heard	a	lot	of	the	 present 	 ations 	 	over	the	last	couple	of	 day 	 s 	 	,	ed	wilson	and	the	 picture 	 s 	 	of	james	nachtwey	,	i	think	we	all	 real 	 ized 	 	how	far	we	have	to	go	to	get	to	 th 	 is 	 	new	version	of	 human 	 ity 	 	that	i	like	to	call	``	 human 	 ity 	 	2.0	.	``
and	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 re 	 side 	 s 	 	in	each	of	us	,	to	close	what	i	think	are	the	two	big	 calam 	 ities 	 	in	the	world	 to 	 day 	 	.
one	is	the	gap	in	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	gap	that	 p 	 resident 	 	clinton	last	night	 call 	 ed 	 	 un 	 even 	 	,	 un 	 fair 	 	and	 un 	 sustain 	 able 	 	--	and	,	out	of	that	,	 come 	 s 	 	poverty	and	 il 	 liter 	 acy 	 	and	disease	and	all	these	 e 	 vil 	 s 	 	that	we	see	around	us	.
but	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	the	other	,	 big 	 ger 	 	gap	is	what	we	call	the	hope	gap	.
and	 some 	 one 	 	,	at	some	point	,	came	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	bad	idea	that	an	 ordin 	 ary 	 	individual	could	n't	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	the	world	.
and	i	think	that	's	just	a	 horr 	 ible 	 	thing	.
and	so	chapter	one	 re 	 ally 	 	 begin 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	with	all	of	us	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 with 	 in 	 	each	of	us	is	the	power	to	equal	 t 	 hose 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	 gap 	 s 	 	and	to	close	the	hope	 gap 	 s 	 	.
and	if	the	men	and	women	of	ted	ca	n't	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	the	world	,	i	do	n't	know	who	can	.
and	for	me	,	a	lot	of	 th 	 is 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	when	i	was	 young 	 er 	 	and	my	family	used	to	go	 camp 	 ing 	 	in	 up 	 state 	 	new	york	.
and	there	 re 	 ally 	 	was	n't	much	to	do	there	for	the	summer	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	get	 beat 	 en 	 	up	by	my	sister	or	read	 book 	 s 	 	.
and	so	i	used	to	read	 author 	 s 	 	like	james	michener	and	james	clavell	and	ayn	rand	.
and	 the 	 ir 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	made	the	world	seem	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	and	 interconnect 	 ed 	 	place	.
and	it	 s 	 truck 	 	me	that	if	i	could	write	 st 	 ories 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	world	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	small	and	 interconnect 	 ed 	 	,	that	 may 	 be 	 	i	could	get	people	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	 issue 	 s 	 	that	 affect 	 ed 	 	us	all	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	engage	them	to	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
i	did	n't	think	that	was	 necess 	 arily 	 	the	best	way	to	make	a	living	,	so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	go	on	a	path	to	 be 	 come 	 	 financial 	 ly 	 	 in 	 dependent 	 	,	so	i	could	write	these	 st 	 ories 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	i	could	.
i	then	had	a	bit	of	a	wake	-	up	call	when	i	was	14	.
and	my	dad	came	home	one	day	and	 announce 	 d 	 	that	he	had	cancer	,	and	it	 look 	 ed 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	bad	.
and	what	he	 s 	 aid 	 	was	,	he	was	n't	so	much	 af 	 raid 	 	that	he	might	die	,	but	that	he	had	n't	 d 	 one 	 	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	with	his	life	.
and	knock	on	wood	,	he	's	still	 al 	 ive 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
but	for	a	young	man	that	made	a	real	impression	on	me	,	that	one	never	 know 	 s 	 	how	much	time	one	 re 	 ally 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	.
so	i	set	out	in	a	 hur 	 ry 	 	.	i	 stud 	 ied 	 	 engineer 	 ing 	 	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	a	couple	of	 business 	 es 	 	that	i	thought	would	be	the	ticket	to	financial	 free 	 dom 	 	.
one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 business 	 es 	 	was	a	computer	 rent 	 al 	 	business	 call 	 ed 	 	micros	on	the	move	,	which	is	 ver 	 y 	 	well	named	,	 be 	 cause 	 	people	 ke 	 pt 	 	 steal 	 ing 	 	the	 computer 	 s 	 	.
so	i	 figur 	 ed 	 	i	 need 	 ed 	 	to	learn	a	little	bit	more	about	business	,	so	i	went	to	stanford	business	school	and	 stud 	 ied 	 	there	.
and	while	i	was	there	,	i	made	 friend 	 s 	 	with	a	fellow	named	pierre	omidyar	,	who	is	here	 to 	 day 	 	.	and	pierre	,	i	 apolog 	 ize 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	photo	from	the	old	 day 	 s 	 	.
and	just	after	i	'd	 graduate 	 d 	 	,	pierre	came	to	me	buy	and	sell	 thing 	 s 	 	 on 	 line 	 	with	each	other	.
and	with	the	 wis 	 dom 	 	of	my	stanford	degree	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	pierre	,	what	a	stupid	idea	.	``
and	 needle 	 s 	 s 	 	to	say	,	i	was	right	.
but	right	after	that	,	pierre	--	in	'96	,	pierre	and	i	left	our	full	-	time	 job 	 s 	 	to	build	ebay	 a 	 s 	 	a	company	.	and	the	rest	of	that	story	,	you	know	.
the	company	went	public	two	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	and	is	 to 	 day 	 	one	of	the	best	known	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	in	the	world	.
 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	people	use	it	in	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 count 	 ries 	 	,	and	so	on	.
but	for	me	,	 personal 	 ly 	 	,	it	was	a	real	change	.
i	went	from	living	in	a	house	with	five	 guy 	 s 	 	in	palo	 al 	 to 	 	and	living	off	 the 	 ir 	 	 left 	 over 	 s 	 	,	to	all	of	a	sudden	 hav 	 ing 	 	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 resource 	 s 	 	.
and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	figure	out	how	i	could	take	the	 bless 	 ing 	 	of	these	 resource 	 s 	 	and	share	it	with	the	world	.
and	around	that	time	,	i	met	john	gardner	,	who	is	a	 remark 	 able 	 	man	.
he	was	the	architect	of	the	great	 socie 	 ty 	 	 program 	 s 	 	under	lyndon	johnson	in	the	1960s	.
and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	him	what	he	felt	was	the	best	thing	i	could	do	,	or	 any 	 one 	 	could	do	,	to	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	the	long	-	term	 issue 	 s 	 	facing	 human 	 ity 	 	.
and	john	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	bet	on	good	people	 do 	 ing 	 	good	 thing 	 s 	 	.
bet	on	good	people	 do 	 ing 	 	good	 thing 	 s 	 	.	``
and	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 reson 	 ated 	 	with	me	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	a	 found 	 ation 	 	to	bet	on	these	good	people	 do 	 ing 	 	good	 thing 	 s 	 	.
these	 lead 	 ing 	 	,	 innov 	 ative 	 	,	 non 	 profit 	 	 folk 	 s 	 	,	who	are	using	business	 skill 	 s 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 leverage 	 d 	 	way	to	solve	social	 problem 	 s 	 	.
people	 to 	 day 	 	we	call	social	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	.
and	to	put	a	face	on	it	,	people	like	muhammad	yunus	,	who	 start 	 ed 	 	the	grameen	bank	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 lift 	 ed 	 	100	million	people	plus	out	of	poverty	around	the	world	,	won	the	 no 	 bel 	 	peace	prize	.
but	there	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	lot	of	people	that	you	do	n't	know	.	 folk 	 s 	 	like	ann	cotton	,	who	 start 	 ed 	 	a	group	 call 	 ed 	 	camfed	in	africa	,	 be 	 cause 	 	she	felt	 girl 	 s 	 	'	education	was	lagging	.
and	she	 start 	 ed 	 	it	about	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	 to 	 day 	 	,	she	 educ 	 ates 	 	over	a	quarter	million	african	 girl 	 s 	 	.
and	 some 	 body 	 	like	dr.	victoria	hale	,	who	 start 	 ed 	 	the	world	's	first	 non 	 profit 	 	pharmaceutical	company	,
and	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	first	drug	will	be	 fight 	 ing 	 	visceral	leishmaniasis	,	 al 	 so 	 	known	 a 	 s 	 	black	 f 	 ever 	 	.
and	by	2010	,	she	 hope 	 s 	 	to	eliminate	 th 	 is 	 	disease	,	which	is	 re 	 ally 	 	a	 scour 	 ge 	 	in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	way	to	bet	on	good	people	 do 	 ing 	 	good	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	a	lot	of	 th 	 is 	 	 come 	 s 	 	together	in	a	 philosoph 	 y 	 	of	change	that	i	find	 re 	 ally 	 	is	 power 	 ful 	 	.
it	's	what	we	call	,	``	invest	,	connect	and	 celebr 	 ate 	 	.	``
and	invest	:	if	you	see	good	people	 do 	 ing 	 	good	 thing 	 s 	 	,
invest	in	them	.	invest	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	,
or	in	business	.	invest	in	these	 folk 	 s 	 	.
 connect 	 ing 	 	them	together	through	 con 	 ference 	 s 	 	--	like	a	ted	--	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	so	 man 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	 connect 	 ions 	 	,
or	through	the	world	forum	on	social	 entrepreneur 	 ship 	 	that	my	 found 	 ation 	 	 do 	 es 	 	at	oxford	every	year	.
and	 celebr 	 ate 	 	them	:	tell	 the 	 ir 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	not	 on 	 ly 	 	are	there	good	people	 do 	 ing 	 	good	work	,	but	 the 	 ir 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	can	help	close	these	 gap 	 s 	 	of	hope	.
and	it	was	 th 	 is 	 	last	part	of	the	mission	,	the	 celebr 	 ate 	 	part	,	that	 re 	 ally 	 	got	me	back	to	 think 	 ing 	 	when	i	was	a	kid	and	 want 	 ed 	 	to	tell	 st 	 ories 	 	to	get	people	 involve 	 d 	 	in	the	 issue 	 s 	 	that	affect	us	all	.
and	a	light	bulb	went	off	,	which	was	,	first	,	that	i	did	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	to	do	the	writing	 my 	 self 	 	,	i	could	find	 writer 	 s 	 	.
and	then	the	next	light	bulb	was	,	better	than	just	writing	,	what	about	film	and	tv	,	to	get	out	to	people	in	a	big	way	?
and	i	thought	about	the	 film 	 s 	 	that	inspired	me	,	 film 	 s 	 	like	``	gandhi	``	and	``	schindler	's	list	.	``
and	i	 wonder 	 ed 	 	who	was	 do 	 ing 	 	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 film 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	there	 re 	 ally 	 	was	n't	a	specific	company	that	was	focused	on	the	public	interest	.
so	,	in	2003	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	make	my	way	around	los	angeles	to	talk	about	the	idea	of	a	pro	-	social	media	company	and	i	was	met	with	a	lot	of	 encourag 	 ement 	 	.
one	of	the	lines	of	 encourag 	 ement 	 	that	i	heard	over	and	over	was	,	``	the	 street 	 s 	 	of	hollywood	are	 litter 	 ed 	 	with	the	carcasses	of	people	like	you	,	who	think	you	're	going	to	come	to	 th 	 is 	 	town	and	make	 movie 	 s 	 	.	``	and	then	of	course	,	there	was	the	other	 ad 	 age 	 	.	``	the	 sur 	 est 	 	way	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	millionaire	is	to	start	by	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 billion 	 aire 	 	and	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	movie	business	.	``	undeterred	,	in	january	of	2004	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 particip 	 ant 	 	 production 	 s 	 	with	the	vision	to	be	a	global	media	company	focused	on	the	public	interest	.
and	our	mission	is	to	produce	 entertain 	 ment 	 	that	 create 	 s 	 	and	 inspire 	 s 	 	social	change	.
and	we	do	n't	just	want	people	to	see	our	 movie 	 s 	 	and	say	,	that	was	 f 	 un 	 	,	and	forget	about	it	.
we	want	them	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	 involve 	 d 	 	in	the	 issue 	 s 	 	.
in	2005	,	we	 launch 	 ed 	 	our	first	 s 	 late 	 	of	 film 	 s 	 	,	``	murder	ball	,	``	``	north	country	,	``	``	syriana	``	and	``	good	night	and	good	luck	.	``
and	much	to	my	surprise	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 notice 	 d 	 	.
we	 end 	 ed 	 	up	with	11	oscar	nominations	for	these	 film 	 s 	 	.
and	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	year	for	 th 	 is 	 	guy	.
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	 join 	 ed 	 	the	 advoc 	 acy 	 	 program 	 s 	 	and	the	 activ 	 ism 	 	 program 	 s 	 	that	we	 create 	 d 	 	to	go	around	the	 movie 	 s 	 	.
and	we	had	an	 on 	 line 	 	component	of	that	,	our	community	sect	 call 	 ed 	 	 particip 	 ate 	 	.	net	.
but	with	our	social	sector	 partner 	 s 	 	,	like	the	aclu	and	pbs	and	the	sierra	club	and	the	nrdc	,	once	people	saw	the	film	,	there	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	they	could	do	to	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
one	of	these	 film 	 s 	 	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	 call 	 ed 	 	``	north	country	,	``	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	kind	of	a	box	 off 	 ice 	 	disaster	.
but	it	was	a	film	that	 star 	 red 	 	charlize	theron	and	it	was	about	women	's	 right 	 s 	 	,	women	's	 empower 	 ment 	 	,	domestic	violence	and	so	on	.
and	we	released	the	film	at	the	same	time	that	the	congress	was	 deb 	 ating 	 	the	 renew 	 al 	 	of	the	violence	against	women	act	.
and	with	 screen 	 ing 	 s 	 	on	the	hill	,	and	 discuss 	 ions 	 	,	and	with	our	social	sector	 partner 	 s 	 	,	like	the	national	 organ 	 ization 	 	of	women	,	the	film	was	 wide 	 ly 	 	 credit 	 ed 	 	with	 in 	 flu 	 encing 	 	the	 success 	 ful 	 	 renew 	 al 	 	of	the	act	.
and	that	to	me	,	spoke	 volume 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	--	the	film	 start 	 ed 	 	about	a	true	-	life	story
about	a	woman	who	was	 harass 	 ed 	 	,	 su 	 ed 	 	her	 employ 	 er 	 	,	led	to	a	 land 	 mark 	 	case	that	led	to	the	equal	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	act	,	and	the	violence	against	women	act	and	 other 	 s 	 	.
and	then	the	movie	about	 th 	 is 	 	person	 do 	 ing 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	then	led	to	 th 	 is 	 	 great 	 er 	 	 renew 	 al 	 	.
and	so	 aga 	 in 	 	,	it	 go 	 es 	 	back	to	 bet 	 ting 	 	on	good	people	 do 	 ing 	 	good	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 s 	 peaking 	 	of	which	,	our	fellow	tedster	,	al	--	i	first	saw	al	do	his	slide	show	 present 	 ation 	 	on	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	in	may	of	2005	.
at	that	point	,	i	thought	i	 k 	 new 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	about	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	.
i	thought	it	was	a	30	to	50	year	problem	.
and	after	we	saw	his	slide	show	,	it	 be 	 came 	 	clear	that	it	was	much	more	 urge 	 nt 	 	.
and	so	right	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	i	met	 back 	 stage 	 	with	al	,	and	with	lawrence	bender	,	who	was	there	,	and	laurie	david	,	and	davis	guggenheim	,	who	was	running	 document 	 aries 	 	for	 particip 	 ant 	 	at	the	time	.
and	with	al	's	 bless 	 ing 	 	,	we	 decide 	 d 	 	on	the	spot	to	turn	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	film	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	felt	that	we	could	get	the	 mess 	 age 	 	out	there	far	more	 quick 	 ly 	 	than	 hav 	 ing 	 	al	go	around	the	world	,	 s 	 peaking 	 	to	 audience 	 s 	 	of	100	or	200	at	a	time	.
and	you	know	,	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	 ad 	 age 	 	in	hollywood	,	that	 no 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	about	 any 	 thing 	 	.
and	i	 re 	 ally 	 	thought	 th 	 is 	 	was	going	to	be	a	straight	-	to	-	pbs	 char 	 it 	 able 	 	 initi 	 ative 	 	.
and	so	it	was	a	great	shock	to	all	of	us	when	the	film	 re 	 ally 	 	 capture 	 d 	 	the	public	interest	,	and	 to 	 day 	 	is	 man 	 d 	 atory 	 	 view 	 ing 	 	in	 school 	 s 	 	in	england	and	scotland	,	and	most	of	scandinavia	.
we	've	 s 	 ent 	 	50,000	dvds	to	high	school	 teacher 	 s 	 	in	the	u.s.	and	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 change 	 d 	 	the	debate	on	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	.
it	was	 al 	 so 	 	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	year	for	 th 	 is 	 	guy	.
we	now	call	al	the	george	clooney	of	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	.
and	for	 particip 	 ant 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	the	start	.
 every 	 thing 	 	we	do	 look 	 s 	 	at	the	major	 issue 	 s 	 	in	the	world	.
and	we	have	10	 film 	 s 	 	in	production	right	now	,	and	 dozen 	 s 	 	 other 	 s 	 	in	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
i	'll	 quick 	 ly 	 	talk	about	a	few	coming	up	.
one	is	``	charlie	wilson	's	war	,	``	with	tom	hanks	and	julia	roberts	.
and	it	's	the	true	story	of	 congress 	 man 	 	charlie	wilson	,	and	how	he	funded	the	taliban	to	fight	the	russians	in	afghanistan	.
and	we	're	 al 	 so 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	a	movie	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	kite	runner	,	``	based	on	the	book	``	the	kite	runner	,	``	 al 	 so 	 	about	afghanistan	.
and	we	think	once	people	see	these	 film 	 s 	 	,	they	'll	have	a	much	better	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	that	part	of	the	world
and	the	middle	east	in	general	.	we	 premiere 	 d 	 	a	film	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	chicago	10	``	at	sundance	 th 	 is 	 	year	.
it	's	based	on	the	 protest 	 ers 	 	at	the	 democrat 	 ic 	 	convention	in	1968	,	abby	hoffman	and	crew	,
and	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	a	story	about	a	small	group	of	 individual 	 s 	 	who	did	make	change	in	the	world	.
and	a	 document 	 ary 	 	that	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	on	jimmy	carter	and	his	mid	-	east	peace	 effort 	 s 	 	over	the	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 follow 	 ing 	 	him	on	his	 re 	 cent 	 	book	tour	,	which	,	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	know	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	non	-	controversial	--	--	which	is	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	for	 get 	 ting 	 	people	to	come	see	a	movie	.
in	 clo 	 s 	 ing 	 	,	i	'd	like	to	say	that	 every 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	make	change	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	way	.
and	all	the	people	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	have	 d 	 one 	 	so	through	 the 	 ir 	 	business	 live 	 s 	 	,	or	 the 	 ir 	 	 philanthro 	 pic 	 	work	,	or	 the 	 ir 	 	other	 interest 	 s 	 	.
and	one	thing	that	i	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	is	that	there	's	never	one	right	way	to	make	change	.
one	can	do	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	tech	person	,	or	 a 	 s 	 	a	finance	person	,	or	a	 non 	 profit 	 	person	,	or	 a 	 s 	 	an	 entertain 	 ment 	 	person	,	but	every	one	of	us	is	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	and	more	.
and	i	 believ 	 e 	 	if	we	do	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	we	can	close	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	 gap 	 s 	 	,	we	can	close	the	hope	 gap 	 s 	 	.
and	i	can	imagine	,	if	we	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	the	 head 	 lines 	 	in	10	 year 	 s 	 	might	read	 some 	 thing 	 	like	these	:	``	new	 aid 	 s 	 	 case 	 s 	 	in	africa	fall	to	zero	,	``	``	u.s.	 import 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	last	barrel	of	oil	``	--	--	``	israelis	and	palestinians	 celebr 	 ate 	 	10	 year 	 s 	 	of	 peace 	 ful 	 	coexistence	.	``	and	i	like	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	``	snow	 ha 	 s 	 	 return 	 ed 	 	to	kilimanjaro	.	``
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	an	ebay	 list 	 ing 	 	for	one	well	-	 travel 	 ed 	 	slide	show	,	now	 obsolet 	 e 	 	,	museum	piece	.	 pleas 	 e 	 	contact	al	gore	.
and	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	,	 work 	 ing 	 	together	,	we	can	make	all	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	happen	.
and	i	want	to	thank	you	all	for	 hav 	 ing 	 	me	here	 to 	 day 	 	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	real	honor	.	thank	you	.
oh	,	thank	you	.
