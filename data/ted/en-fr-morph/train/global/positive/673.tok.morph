one	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	cartoon	 character 	 s 	 	is	snoopy	.
i	love	the	way	he	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	and	lies	on	his	 ke 	 nnel 	 	and	 contempl 	 ates 	 	the	great	 thing 	 s 	 	of	life	.
so	when	i	thought	about	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	my	mind	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	went	to	one	of	the	cartoon	 strip 	 s 	 	,	where	he	's	 ly 	 ing 	 	there	and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	 re 	 ally 	 	understand	,	and	i	 re 	 ally 	 	appreciate	how	one	should	love	one	's	neighbor	 a 	 s 	 	one	love	's	 one 	 self 	 	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	trouble	is	the	people	next	door	;	i	ca	n't	stand	them	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	,	in	a	way	,	is	one	of	the	 challeng 	 es 	 	of	how	to	interpret	a	 re 	 ally 	 	good	idea	.
we	all	,	i	think	,	 believ 	 e 	 	in	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
if	you	look	at	all	the	world	 relig 	 ions 	 	,	all	the	main	world	 relig 	 ions 	 	,	you	'll	find	 with 	 in 	 	them	some	 teach 	 ing 	 	 concern 	 ing 	 	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
so	in	judaism	,	we	have	,	from	our	torah	,	that	you	should	love	your	neighbor	 a 	 s 	 	you	love	 your 	 self 	 	.
and	 with 	 in 	 	jewish	 teach 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	the	 rabbi 	 nic 	 	 teach 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	we	have	hillel	,	who	taught	that	you	should	n't	do	to	 other 	 s 	 	what	you	do	n't	like	 be 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	to	 your 	 self 	 	.
and	all	the	main	 relig 	 ions 	 	have	similar	 teach 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 with 	 in 	 	judaism	,	we	have	a	 teach 	 ing 	 	about	god	,	who	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 com 	 passionate 	 	one	,	ha	-	rachaman	.
after	all	,	how	could	the	world	exist	 with 	 out 	 	god	 be 	 ing 	 	 com 	 passionate 	 	?
and	we	,	 a 	 s 	 	taught	 with 	 in 	 	the	torah	that	we	are	made	in	the	image	of	god	,	so	we	too	have	to	be	 com 	 passionate 	 	.
but	what	 do 	 es 	 	it	mean	?	how	 do 	 es 	 	it	impact	on	our	 every 	 day 	 	life	?
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	of	course	,	 be 	 ing 	 	 com 	 passionate 	 	can	produce	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	us	that	are	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	to	control	.
i	know	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	when	i	've	gone	and	 conduct 	 ed 	 	a	funeral	,	or	when	i	have	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	with	the	 be 	 re 	 av 	 ed 	 	,	or	with	people	who	are	 dy 	 ing 	 	,	and	i	am	 overwhelm 	 ed 	 	by	the	 s 	 ad 	 ness 	 	,	by	the	 difficult 	 y 	 	,	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	that	is	there	for	the	family	,	for	the	person	.
and	i	'm	 touch 	 ed 	 	,	so	that	 tear 	 s 	 	come	to	my	 eye 	 s 	 	.
and	yet	,	if	i	just	 allow 	 ed 	 	 my 	 self 	 	to	be	 overwhelm 	 ed 	 	by	these	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	i	would	n't	be	 do 	 ing 	 	my	job	--	 be 	 cause 	 	i	have	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	there	for	them	and	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	 ritual 	 s 	 	happen	,	that	 practical 	 ities 	 	are	 s 	 een 	 	to	.
and	yet	,	on	the	other	hand	,	if	i	did	n't	feel	 th 	 is 	 	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	then	i	feel	that	it	would	be	time	for	me	to	hang	up	my	robe	and	give	up	 be 	 ing 	 	a	rabbi	.
and	these	same	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	are	there	for	all	of	us	 a 	 s 	 	we	face	the	world	.
who	can	not	be	 touch 	 ed 	 	by	 compass 	 ion 	 	when	we	see	the	 terr 	 ible 	 	 horr 	 ors 	 	of	the	 result 	 s 	 	of	war	,	or	famine	,	or	 earth 	 quake 	 s 	 	,	or	 tsunami 	 s 	 	?
i	know	some	people	who	say	``	well	,	you	know	there	's	just	so	much	out	there	--	i	ca	n't	do	 any 	 thing 	 	,
i	'm	not	going	to	even	begin	to	try	.	``
and	there	are	some	 char 	 ity 	 	 work 	 ers 	 	who	call	 th 	 is 	 	 compass 	 ion 	 	fatigue	.
there	are	 other 	 s 	 	who	feel	they	ca	n't	confront	 compass 	 ion 	 	 any 	 more 	 	,	and	so	they	turn	off	the	 tele 	 vision 	 	and	do	n't	watch	.
in	judaism	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	we	tend	to	 al 	 ways 	 	say	,	there	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	a	middle	way	.
you	have	to	,	of	course	,	be	aware	of	the	 need 	 s 	 	of	 other 	 s 	 	,	but	you	have	to	be	aware	in	 s 	 uch 	 	a	way	that	you	can	carry	on	with	your	life	and	be	of	help	to	people	.
so	part	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	an	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	what	 make 	 s 	 	people	tick	.
and	,	of	course	,	you	ca	n't	do	that	 un 	 less 	 	you	understand	 your 	 self 	 	a	bit	more	.
and	there	's	a	 love 	 ly 	 	 rabbi 	 nic 	 	 interpret 	 ation 	 	of	the	 begin 	 ning 	 s 	 	of	creation	,	which	 say 	 s 	 	that	when	god	 create 	 d 	 	the	world	,	god	thought	that	it	would	be	best	to	create	the	world	 on 	 ly 	 	with	the	divine	 attribut 	 e 	 	of	justice	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	after	all	,	god	is	just	.
 there 	 fore 	 	,	there	should	be	justice	 through 	 out 	 	the	world	.
and	then	god	 look 	 ed 	 	to	the	future	and	 real 	 ized 	 	,	if	the	world	was	 create 	 d 	 	just	with	justice	,	the	world	could	n't	exist	.
so	,	god	thought	,	``	nope	,	i	'm	going	to	create	the	world	just	with	 compass 	 ion 	 	.	``
and	then	god	 look 	 ed 	 	to	the	future	and	 real 	 ized 	 	that	,	in	fact	,	if	the	world	 we 	 re 	 	just	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	there	would	be	 anarch 	 y 	 	and	 cha 	 os 	 	.
there	had	to	be	 limit 	 s 	 	to	all	 thing 	 s 	 	.
the	 rabbi 	 s 	 	 de 	 scribe 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	like	a	king	who	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	fragile	glass	bowl	.
if	you	put	too	much	cold	water	in	,	it	will	shatter	.
if	you	put	 boil 	 ing 	 	water	in	,	it	will	shatter	.
what	do	you	have	to	do	?	put	in	a	 mix 	 ture 	 	of	the	two	.
and	so	god	put	both	of	these	 possibil 	 ities 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	world	.
there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	more	 th 	 ough 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	there	.
and	that	is	the	 transl 	 ation 	 	of	the	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	that	we	may	have	about	 compass 	 ion 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 wide 	 r 	 	world	,	 in 	 to 	 	action	.
so	,	like	snoopy	,	we	ca	n't	just	lie	there	and	think	great	 thought 	 s 	 	about	our	 neighbor 	 s 	 	.
we	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	it	.
and	so	there	is	 al 	 so 	 	,	 with 	 in 	 	judaism	,	 th 	 is 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	of	love	and	 kind 	 ness 	 	that	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	:	``	 ches 	 ed 	 	.	``
all	these	three	 thing 	 s 	 	,	then	,	have	to	be	 meld 	 ed 	 	together	.
the	idea	of	justice	,	which	 give 	 s 	 	 bound 	 aries 	 	to	our	 live 	 s 	 	and	 give 	 s 	 	us	a	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	what	's	right	about	life	,	what	's	right	about	living	,	what	should	we	be	 do 	 ing 	 	,	social	justice	.
there	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	a	 will 	 ing 	 ness 	 	to	do	good	 de 	 ed 	 s 	 	,	but	not	,	of	course	,	at	the	expense	of	our	own	 sanit 	 y 	 	.
you	know	,	there	's	no	way	that	you	can	do	 any 	 thing 	 	for	 any 	 one 	 	if	you	 over 	 do 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	 balanc 	 ing 	 	them	all	in	the	middle	is	 th 	 is 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	,
which	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	there	,	if	you	like	,	at	our	 ver 	 y 	 	 root 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	 come 	 s 	 	to	us	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	made	in	the	image	of	god	,
who	is	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	the	 com 	 passionate 	 	one	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 compass 	 ion 	 	 en 	 tail 	 	?
it	 en 	 tail 	 s 	 	 understand 	 ing 	 	the	pain	of	the	other	.
but	even	more	than	that	,	it	 mean 	 s 	 	 understand 	 ing 	 	one	's	 connect 	 ion 	 	to	the	whole	of	creation	:	 understand 	 ing 	 	that	one	is	part	of	that	creation	,	that	there	is	a	 un 	 ity 	 	that	 under 	 lies 	 	all	that	we	see	,	all	that	we	hear	,	all	that	we	feel	.
i	call	that	 un 	 ity 	 	god	.
and	that	 un 	 ity 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 connect 	 s 	 	all	of	creation	.
and	,	of	course	,	in	the	modern	world	,	with	the	 environment 	 al 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	,	we	're	 be 	 coming 	 	even	more	aware	of	the	 connect 	 ivity 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	,	that	 some 	 thing 	 	i	do	here	 actual 	 ly 	 	 do 	 es 	 	matter	in	africa	,	that	if	i	use	too	much	of	my	carbon	 allow 	 ance 	 	,	it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	that	we	are	 caus 	 ing 	 	a	great	lack	of	rain	in	central	and	eastern	africa	.
so	there	is	a	 connect 	 ivity 	 	,
and	i	have	to	understand	that	--	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	the	creation	,	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	me	 be 	 ing 	 	made	in	the	image	of	god	.
and	i	have	to	understand	that	my	 need 	 s 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	have	to	be	 sublimate 	 d 	 	to	other	 need 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	``	18	 minute 	 s 	 	``	business	,	i	find	 quit 	 e 	 	 fasci 	 nating 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	in	judaism	,	the	number	18	,	in	hebrew	 letter 	 s 	 	,	 stand 	 s 	 	for	life	--	the	word	``	life	.	``
so	,	in	a	sense	,	the	18	 minute 	 s 	 	is	 challeng 	 ing 	 	me	to	say	,	``	in	life	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	's	 import 	 ant 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	.	``	but	,	 some 	 thing 	 	else	 a 	 s 	 	well	:
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	18	 minute 	 s 	 	is	 import 	 ant 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	at	passover	,	when	we	have	to	eat	 un 	 leaven 	 ed 	 	bread	,	the	 rabbi 	 s 	 	say	,	what	is	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	dough	that	is	made	 in 	 to 	 	bread	,	and	dough	that	is	made	 in 	 to 	 	 un 	 leaven 	 ed 	 	bread	,	or	``	matzah	``	?
and	they	say	``	it	's	18	 minute 	 s 	 	.	``
 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	how	long	they	say	it	 take 	 s 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	dough	to	 be 	 come 	 	leaven	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	it	mean	,	``	dough	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	leaven	``	?
it	 mean 	 s 	 	it	 get 	 s 	 	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	hot	air	.
what	's	matzah	?	what	's	 un 	 leaven 	 ed 	 	bread	?	you	do	n't	get	it	.
 symbol 	 ically 	 	,	what	the	 rabbi 	 s 	 	say	is	that	at	passover	,	what	we	have	to	do	is	try	to	get	rid	of	our	hot	air	--	our	 pri 	 de 	 	,	our	 feel 	 ing 	 	that	we	are	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	people	in	the	whole	entire	world	,	and	that	 every 	 thing 	 	should	 r 	 evolve 	 	round	us	.
so	we	try	and	get	rid	of	 t 	 hose 	 	,	and	so	 do 	 ing 	 	,	try	to	get	rid	of	the	 habit 	 s 	 	,	the	 emotion 	 s 	 	,	the	 idea 	 s 	 	that	enslave	us	,	that	make	our	 eye 	 s 	 	closed	,	give	us	tunnel	vision	so	we	do	n't	see	the	 need 	 s 	 	of	 other 	 s 	 	--	and	free	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	free	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	from	that	.
and	that	too	is	a	 bas 	 is 	 	for	 hav 	 ing 	 	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	for	 understand 	 ing 	 	our	place	in	the	world	.
now	there	is	,	in	judaism	,	a	 gorge 	 ous 	 	story	of	a	rich	man	who	 s 	 at 	 	in	 s 	 y 	 nag 	 ogue 	 	one	day	.
and	,	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	do	,	he	was	 doz 	 ing 	 	off	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	sermon	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	he	was	 doz 	 ing 	 	off	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 read 	 ing 	 	from	the	book	of	leviticus	in	the	torah	.
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	that	in	the	ancient	 time 	 s 	 	in	the	temple	in	jerusalem	,	the	 priest 	 s 	 	used	to	have	bread	,	which	they	used	to	place	 in 	 to 	 	a	special	table	in	the	temple	in	jerusalem	.
the	man	was	 a 	 sleep 	 	,	but	he	heard	the	 word 	 s 	 	bread	,	temple	,	god	,	and	he	 wok 	 e 	 	up	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	god	 want 	 s 	 	bread	.	that	's	it	.	god	 want 	 s 	 	bread	.	i	know	what	god	 want 	 s 	 	.	``
and	he	 rush 	 ed 	 	home	.	and	after	the	sabbath	,	he	made	12	 lo 	 ave 	 s 	 	of	bread	,	took	them	to	the	 s 	 y 	 nag 	 ogue 	 	,	went	 in 	 to 	 	the	 s 	 y 	 nag 	 ogue 	 	,	 open 	 ed 	 	the	ark	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	god	,	i	do	n't	know	why	you	want	 th 	 is 	 	bread	,	but	here	you	are	.	``
and	he	put	it	in	the	ark	with	the	 scroll 	 s 	 	of	the	torah	.
then	he	went	home	.
the	 clean 	 er 	 	came	 in 	 to 	 	the	 s 	 y 	 nag 	 ogue 	 	.
``	oh	god	,	i	'm	in	 s 	 uch 	 	trouble	.	i	've	got	children	to	feed	.
my	wife	's	ill.	i	've	got	no	money	.	what	can	i	do	?	``
he	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 s 	 y 	 nag 	 ogue 	 	.	``	god	,	will	you	 pleas 	 e 	 	help	me	?
ah	,	what	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	smell	.	``
he	 go 	 es 	 	to	the	ark	.	he	 open 	 s 	 	the	ark	.
``	there	's	bread	!	god	,	you	've	 answer 	 ed 	 	my	 ple 	 a 	 	.	you	've	 answer 	 ed 	 	my	question	.	``
 take 	 s 	 	the	bread	and	 go 	 es 	 	home	.
 mean 	 while 	 	,	the	rich	man	 think 	 s 	 	to	 him 	 self 	 	,	``	i	'm	an	idiot	.	god	 want 	 s 	 	bread	?
god	,	the	one	who	 rule 	 s 	 	the	entire	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	 want 	 s 	 	my	bread	?	``
he	 rush 	 es 	 	to	the	 s 	 y 	 nag 	 ogue 	 	.	``	i	'll	get	it	out	of	the	ark	before	 any 	 body 	 	 find 	 s 	 	it	.	``
he	 go 	 es 	 	in	there	,	and	it	's	not	there	.
and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	god	,	you	 re 	 ally 	 	did	want	it	.	you	 want 	 ed 	 	my	bread	.
next	week	,	with	 raisin 	 s 	 	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	went	on	for	 year 	 s 	 	.
every	week	,	the	man	would	 br 	 ing 	 	bread	with	 raisin 	 s 	 	,	with	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	good	 thing 	 s 	 	,	put	it	 in 	 to 	 	the	ark	.
every	week	,	the	 clean 	 er 	 	would	come	.	``	god	you	've	 answer 	 ed 	 	my	 ple 	 a 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.	``
take	the	bread	.	take	it	home	.
went	on	 un 	 til 	 	a	new	rabbi	came	.	 rabbi 	 s 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	spoil	 thing 	 s 	 	.
the	rabbi	came	in	and	saw	what	was	going	on	.
and	he	 call 	 ed 	 	the	two	of	them	to	his	 off 	 ice 	 	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	you	know	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	.	``
and	the	rich	man	--	oh	,	dear	--	 crest 	 fall 	 en 	 	.
``	you	mean	god	did	n't	want	my	bread	?	``
and	the	poor	man	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	and	you	mean	god	did	n't	answer	my	pleas	?	``
and	the	rabbi	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	've	 mis 	 under 	 stood 	 	me	.
you	've	 mis 	 under 	 stood 	 	 total 	 ly 	 	,	``	he	 s 	 aid 	 	.
``	of	course	,	what	you	are	 do 	 ing 	 	,	``	he	 s 	 aid 	 	to	the	rich	man	,	``	is	 answer 	 ing 	 	god	's	 ple 	 a 	 	that	we	should	be	 com 	 passionate 	 	.
and	god	,	``	he	 s 	 aid 	 	to	the	poor	man	,	``	is	 answer 	 ing 	 	your	 ple 	 a 	 	that	people	should	be	 com 	 passionate 	 	and	give	.	``
he	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	rich	man	.	he	held	the	rich	man	's	 hand 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	do	n't	you	understand	?	``	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	these	are	the	 hand 	 s 	 	of	god	.	``
so	that	is	the	way	i	feel	:	that	i	can	 on 	 ly 	 	try	to	approach	 th 	 is 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 com 	 passionate 	 	,	of	 understand 	 ing 	 	that	there	is	a	 connect 	 ivity 	 	,	that	there	is	a	 un 	 ity 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	world	;	that	i	want	to	try	and	serve	that	 un 	 ity 	 	,	and	that	i	can	try	and	do	that	by	 understand 	 ing 	 	,	i	hope	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	 some 	 thing 	 	of	the	pain	of	 other 	 s 	 	;	but	 understand 	 ing 	 	that	there	are	 limit 	 s 	 	,	that	people	have	to	bear	 respons 	 ibility 	 	for	some	of	the	 problem 	 s 	 	that	come	 up 	 on 	 	them	;	and	that	i	have	to	understand	that	there	are	 limit 	 s 	 	to	my	energy	,	to	the	giving	i	can	give	.
i	have	to	 re 	 evaluate 	 	them	,	try	and	 separat 	 e 	 	out	the	material	 thing 	 s 	 	and	my	 emotion 	 s 	 	that	may	be	 en 	 s 	 lav 	 ing 	 	me	,	so	that	i	can	see	the	world	 clear 	 ly 	 	.
and	then	i	have	to	try	to	see	in	what	ways	i	can	make	these	the	 hand 	 s 	 	of	god	.
and	so	try	to	 br 	 ing 	 	 compass 	 ion 	 	to	life	in	 th 	 is 	 	world	.
