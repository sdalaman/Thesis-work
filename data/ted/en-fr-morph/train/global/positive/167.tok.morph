but	there	was	 some 	 thing 	 	else	that	i	've	 notice 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 change 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	taking	place	,	 a 	 s 	 	people	 we 	 re 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	to	find	out	that	hmm	...	 yea 	 h 	 	,	there	 re 	 ally 	 	is	a	black	hole	at	the	center	of	every	 galax 	 y 	 	.
the	science	 writer 	 s 	 	and	 editor 	 s 	 	--	i	should	n't	say	science	 writer 	 s 	 	,	i	should	say	people	who	write	about	science	--	and	 editor 	 s 	 	would	 s 	 it 	 	down	over	a	couple	of	 beer 	 s 	 	,	after	a	hard	day	of	work	,	and	start	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	some	of	these	 in 	 credible 	 	 per 	 ception 	 s 	 	about	how	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 work 	 s 	 	.
and	they	would	 inevit 	 ably 	 	end	up	in	what	i	thought	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	bizarre	place	,	which	is	ways	the	world	could	end	 ver 	 y 	 	 sudden 	 ly 	 	.
and	that	's	what	i	want	to	talk	about	 to 	 day 	 	.
ah	,	you	laugh	,	you	 fool 	 s 	 	.
 yea 	 h 	 	,	we	need	the	time	!
stephen	petranek	:	at	first	,	it	all	 seem 	 ed 	 	a	little	 fantastic 	 al 	 	to	me	,	but	after	 challeng 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	these	 idea 	 s 	 	,	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	take	a	lot	of	them	 serious 	 ly 	 	.	and	then	september	11	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	and	i	thought	,	ah	,	god	,	i	ca	n't	go	to	the	ted	 con 	 ference 	 	and	talk	about	how	the	world	is	going	to	end	.
 no 	 body 	 	 want 	 s 	 	to	hear	that	.	not	after	 th 	 is 	 	!
and	that	got	me	 in 	 to 	 	a	 discuss 	 ion 	 	with	some	other	people	,	other	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	about	 may 	 be 	 	some	other	 subject 	 s 	 	,	and	one	of	the	 guy 	 s 	 	i	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	,	who	was	a	 neuro 	 scientist 	 	,	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	,	i	think	there	are	a	lot	of	 solution 	 s 	 	to	the	 problem 	 s 	 	you	 br 	 ought 	 	up	,	``	and	 re 	 mind 	 s 	 	me	of	michael	's	talk	 yester 	 day 	 	and	his	mother	 say 	 ing 	 	you	ca	n't	have	a	solution	if	you	do	n't	have	a	problem	.
so	,	we	went	out	looking	for	 solution 	 s 	 	to	ways	that	the	world	might	end	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	,	and	lo	and	 be 	 hold 	 	,	we	found	them	.
which	 lead 	 s 	 	me	to	a	 video 	 tape 	 	of	a	 p 	 resident 	 	bush	press	 con 	 ference 	 	from	a	couple	of	 week 	 s 	 	ago	.

 p 	 resident 	 	george	w.	bush	:	 what 	 ever 	 	it	 cost 	 s 	 	to	defend	our	security	,	and	 what 	 ever 	 	it	 cost 	 s 	 	to	defend	our	 free 	 dom 	 	,	we	must	pay	it	.

he	 want 	 s 	 	two	trillion	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	protect	us	from	 terrorist 	 s 	 	next	year	,	a	two	-	trillion	-	dollar	federal	budget	,	which	will	land	us	back	 in 	 to 	 	 defici 	 t 	 	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	real	fast	.	but	 terrorist 	 s 	 	are	n't	the	 on 	 ly 	 	threat	we	face	.
there	are	 re 	 ally 	 	serious	 calam 	 ities 	 	 star 	 ing 	 	us	in	the	eye	that	we	're	in	the	same	kind	of	 deni 	 al 	 	about	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	about	 terror 	 ism 	 	,	and	what	could	've	 happen 	 ed 	 	on	september	11	.

so	let	's	start	.	number	10	:	we	lose	the	will	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	.
we	live	in	an	 in 	 credible 	 	age	of	modern	medicine	.	we	are	all	much	 health 	 ier 	 	than	we	 we 	 re 	 	20	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
people	around	the	world	are	 get 	 ting 	 	better	medicine	--	but	 ment 	 ally 	 	,	we	're	 fall 	 ing 	 	 a 	 part 	 	.
the	world	health	 organ 	 ization 	 	now	 estimate 	 s 	 	that	one	out	of	five	people	on	the	planet	is	 clinic 	 ally 	 	 depress 	 ed 	 	.
and	the	world	health	 organ 	 ization 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 say 	 s 	 	that	 depress 	 ion 	 	is	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 epi 	 demic 	 	that	 human 	 kind 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	 face 	 d 	 	.
soon	,	genetic	 break 	 through 	 s 	 	and	even	better	medicine	are	going	to	allow	us	to	think	of	100	 a 	 s 	 	a	normal	 life 	 span 	 	.
a	female	child	born	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	,	on	average	--	 med 	 ian 	 	--	will	live	to	age	83	.
our	life	 long 	 ev 	 ity 	 	is	going	up	 al 	 most 	 	a	year	for	every	year	that	 pass 	 es 	 	.
now	the	problem	with	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	 get 	 ting 	 	 old 	 er 	 	,	is	that	people	over	65	are	the	most	 like 	 ly 	 	people	to	commit	 su 	 icide 	 	.
so	,	what	are	the	 solution 	 s 	 	?
we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	have	mental	health	 insur 	 ance 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	,	and	it	's	--	--	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	a	crime	.
 some 	 thing 	 	like	98	percent	of	all	people	with	 depress 	 ion 	 	,	and	i	mean	 re 	 ally 	 	severe	 depress 	 ion 	 	--	i	have	a	friend	with	 stunn 	 ing 	 ly 	 	severe	 depress 	 ion 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 cur 	 able 	 	disease	,	with	present	medicine	and	present	technology	.
but	it	is	often	a	combination	of	talk	therapy	and	 pill 	 s 	 	.
 pill 	 s 	 	 al 	 one 	 	do	n't	do	it	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	in	 clinic 	 ally 	 	 depress 	 ed 	 	people	.
you	ought	to	be	able	to	go	to	a	psychiatrist	or	a	 psycho 	 logist 	 	,	and	put	down	your	10	-	dollar	copay	,	and	get	 treat 	 ed 	 	,	just	like	you	do	when	you	got	a	cut	on	your	arm	.	it	's	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	.
 second 	 ly 	 	,	drug	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	are	not	going	to	develop	 re 	 ally 	 	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	psychoactive	 drug 	 s 	 	.	we	know	that	most	mental	 ill 	 ness 	 es 	 	have	a	 bio 	 logical 	 	component	that	can	be	 deal 	 t 	 	with	.
and	we	know	just	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	amount	more	about	the	brain	now	than	we	did	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.	we	need	a	pump	-	push	from	the	federal	government	,	through	nih	and	national	science	--	nsf	--	and	 place 	 s 	 	like	that	to	start	 help 	 ing 	 	the	drug	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	develop	some	 advance 	 d 	 	psychoactive	 drug 	 s 	 	.

ten	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	you	could	n't	have	found	an	astronomer	--	well	,	 ver 	 y 	 	few	 astronomer 	 s 	 	--	in	the	world	who	would	've	told	you	that	there	are	any	 planet 	 s 	 	 any 	 where 	 	 out 	 side 	 	our	solar	system	.
1995	,	we	found	three	.	the	count	now	is	up	to	80	--

all	of	the	 one 	 s 	 	we	've	found	,	by	the	way	,	are	in	 th 	 is 	 	little	,	 teen 	 y 	 	,	 tin 	 y 	 	corner	where	we	live	,	in	the	 milk 	 y 	 	way	.	there	must	be	 million 	 s 	 	of	 planet 	 s 	 	in	the	 milk 	 y 	 	way	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	carl	sagan	 insist 	 ed 	 	for	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	was	 laugh 	 ed 	 	at	for	it	,	there	must	be	 billion 	 s 	 	and	 billion 	 s 	 	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.

it	's	 be 	 coming 	 	obvious	that	the	chance	that	life	 do 	 es 	 	not	exist	 else 	 where 	 	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	and	 prob 	 ably 	 	 fair 	 ly 	 	close	to	us	,	is	a	 fair 	 ly 	 	remote	idea	.
and	the	chance	that	some	of	it	is	n't	more	intelligent	than	 our 	 s 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	a	remote	idea	.

now	,	what	will	happen	?	what	if	they	come	to	,	you	know	,	suck	up	our	 ocean 	 s 	 	for	the	hydrogen	?
and	swat	us	away	like	flies	,	the	way	we	swat	away	flies	when	we	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	 rain 	 forest 	 	and	start	logging	it	.
we	can	look	at	our	own	 histo 	 ry 	 	.	the	late	physicist	gerard	o'neill	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 advance 	 d 	 	western	 civil 	 ization 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	had	a	 destruct 	 ive 	 	effect	on	all	primitive	 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	come	in	contact	with	,	even	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 case 	 s 	 	where	every	attempt	was	made	to	protect	and	guard	the	primitive	 civil 	 ization 	 	.	``
if	the	 alien 	 s 	 	come	 visit 	 ing 	 	,	we	're	the	primitive	 civil 	 ization 	 	.
so	,	what	are	the	 solution 	 s 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	?
thank	god	you	can	all	read	!
it	may	seem	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	,	but	we	have	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 lous 	 y 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 anticip 	 ating 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	prepared	for	them	.

and	that	is	not	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	beyond	 comprehens 	 ion 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	.

 man 	 y 	 	other	 eco 	 system 	 s 	 	on	earth	are	in	real	,	real	danger	.
we	're	living	in	a	time	of	mass	 extinct 	 ions 	 	that	 exceed 	 s 	 	the	fossil	record	by	a	factor	of	10,000	.
we	have	lost	25	percent	of	the	 un 	 ique 	 	species	in	hawaii	in	the	last	20	 year 	 s 	 	.	california	is	 expect 	 ed 	 	to	lose	25	percent	of	 it 	 s 	 	species	in	the	next	40	 year 	 s 	 	.

there	's	 re 	 ally 	 	a	tree	like	that	out	there	.	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	what	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	.
and	when	that	 eco 	 system 	 	 collapse 	 s 	 	,	it	could	take	a	major	 eco 	 system 	 	with	it	,	like	our	atmosphere	.	so	,	what	do	we	do	about	 th 	 is 	 	?	what	are	the	 solution 	 s 	 	?
there	is	some	 model 	 ing 	 	of	 eco 	 system 	 s 	 	going	on	now	.
the	problem	with	 eco 	 system 	 s 	 	is	that	we	understand	them	so	 poor 	 ly 	 	,	that	we	do	n't	know	they	're	 re 	 ally 	 	in	trouble	 un 	 til 	 	it	's	 al 	 most 	 	too	late	.

one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	he	raved	about	was	that	a	particle	 accele 	 rator 	 	experiment	could	go	 hay 	 wire 	 	and	set	off	a	chain	 re 	 action 	 	that	would	destroy	the	world	.
a	lot	of	 ver 	 y 	 	sober	-	minded	 physicist 	 s 	 	,	 believ 	 e 	 	it	or	not	,	have	had	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	thought	.

other	collider	 experiment 	 s 	 	--	there	's	one	that	's	going	to	take	place	next	summer	at	cern	--	have	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	creating	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	strangelets	,	which	are	kind	of	like	 anti 	 matter 	 	.	 when 	 ever 	 	they	hit	other	matter	,	they	destroy	it	and	obliterate	it	.	most	 physicist 	 s 	 	say	that	the	 accele 	 rator 	 s 	 	we	have	now	are	not	 re 	 ally 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	to	create	black	 hole 	 s 	 	and	strangelets	that	we	need	to	worry	about	,	and	they	're	 prob 	 ably 	 	right	.

we	shut	one	down	that	was	going	to	be	big	.

we	have	an	 electro 	 magnet 	 ic 	 	field	around	the	earth	,	and	it	's	 constant 	 ly 	 	 bombard 	 ed 	 	by	high	-	energy	 particle 	 s 	 	,	like	 proton 	 s 	 	.
and	in	my	opinion	,	we	do	n't	 s 	 pend 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	time	looking	at	that	natural	 labor 	 atory 	 	and	 figur 	 ing 	 	out	first	what	's	safe	to	do	on	earth	.
number	six	:	 bio 	 tech 	 	disaster	.	it	's	one	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 one 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	on	bt	corn	.
bt	corn	is	a	corn	that	 create 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	own	 pest 	 icide 	 	to	kill	a	corn	borer	.
you	may	of	heard	of	it	--	heard	it	 call 	 ed 	 	starlink	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	when	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 ta 	 co 	 	 shell 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	taken	out	of	the	 super 	 market 	 s 	 	about	a	year	and	a	half	ago	.
 th 	 is 	 	stuff	was	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	 on 	 ly 	 	be	feed	for	 animal 	 s 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	and	it	got	 in 	 to 	 	the	human	food	supply	,	and	 some 	 body 	 	should	've	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	that	it	would	get	in	the	human	food	supply	 ver 	 y 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	.
but	the	thing	that	's	 alarm 	 ing 	 	is	a	couple	of	 month 	 s 	 	ago	,	in	mexico	,	where	bt	corn	and	all	 genetic 	 ally 	 	 alter 	 ed 	 	corn	is	 total 	 ly 	 	 il 	 legal 	 	,	they	found	bt	corn	 gene 	 s 	 	in	wild	corn	 plant 	 s 	 	.
now	,	corn	 origin 	 ated 	 	,	we	think	,	in	mexico	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	genetic	 bio 	 divers 	 ity 	 	storehouse	of	corn	.
 th 	 is 	 	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	back	a	 skeptic 	 ism 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	away	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	that	superweeds	and	superpests	could	spread	around	the	world	,	from	 bio 	 technology 	 	,	that	 liter 	 ally 	 	could	destroy	the	world	's	food	supply	in	 ver 	 y 	 	short	order	.
so	,	what	do	we	do	about	that	?
we	treat	 bio 	 technology 	 	with	the	same	 scru 	 tin 	 y 	 	we	 app 	 ly 	 	to	nuclear	power	 plant 	 s 	 	.
it	's	that	simple	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 un 	 regulat 	 ed 	 	field	.
when	the	starlink	disaster	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	there	was	a	battle	between	the	epa	and	the	fda	over	who	 re 	 ally 	 	had	 author 	 ity 	 	,	and	over	what	 part 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	they	did	n't	get	it	 straight 	 ened 	 	out	for	 month 	 s 	 	.	that	's	kind	of	crazy	.
number	five	,	one	of	my	 favor 	 ites 	 	:	 revers 	 al 	 	of	the	earth	's	 magnet 	 ic 	 	field	.
 believ 	 e 	 	it	or	not	,	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	every	few	hundred	thousand	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	in	our	 histo 	 ry 	 	.	north	pole	 go 	 es 	 	to	the	south	,	south	pole	 go 	 es 	 	to	the	north	,	and	vice	versa	.
but	what	 happen 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 occur 	 s 	 	,	is	that	we	lose	our	 magnet 	 ic 	 	field	around	the	earth	over	the	period	of	about	100	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	all	these	 cosm 	 ic 	 	 ray 	 s 	 	and	 particle 	 s 	 	that	are	to	come	 stream 	 ing 	 	at	us	from	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	that	 th 	 is 	 	field	 protect 	 s 	 	us	from	,	are	--	well	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	we	're	gon	na	fry	.
sp	:	so	,	what	can	we	do	about	 th 	 is 	 	?	oh	,	by	the	way	,	we	're	 over 	 due 	 	.	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	780,000	 year 	 s 	 	since	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
so	,	it	should	have	 happen 	 ed 	 	about	480,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
oh	,	and	here	's	one	other	thing	.	 scientist 	 s 	 	think	now	our	 magnet 	 ic 	 	field	may	be	 diminish 	 ed 	 	by	about	five	percent	.	so	,	 may 	 be 	 	we	're	in	the	throes	of	it	.
one	of	the	 problem 	 s 	 	of	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	how	 health 	 y 	 	the	earth	is	,	is	that	we	have	--	you	know	,	we	do	n't	have	good	weather	data	from	60	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	much	less	data	on	 thing 	 s 	 	like	the	 o 	 zone 	 	layer	.
so	,	there	's	a	 fair 	 ly 	 	simple	solution	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
there	's	going	to	be	a	lot	of	cheap	 rocket 	 ry 	 	that	's	going	to	come	 on 	 line 	 	in	about	six	or	seven	 year 	 s 	 	that	 get 	 s 	 	us	 in 	 to 	 	the	low	atmosphere	 ver 	 y 	 	 cheap 	 ly 	 	.
you	know	,	we	can	make	 o 	 zone 	 	from	car	 tail 	 pipe 	 s 	 	.
it	's	not	hard	:	it	's	just	three	oxygen	 atom 	 s 	 	.
if	you	 br 	 ought 	 	the	entire	 o 	 zone 	 	layer	down	to	the	surface	of	the	earth	,	it	would	be	the	 thick 	 ness 	 	of	two	 penni 	 es 	 	,	at	14	 pound 	 s 	 	per	square	inch	.
you	do	n't	need	that	much	up	there	.
we	need	to	learn	how	to	repair	and	replenish	the	earth	's	 o 	 zone 	 	layer	.
number	four	:	giant	solar	 flare 	 s 	 	.
solar	 flare 	 s 	 	are	enormous	 magnet 	 ic 	 	outbursts	from	the	 s 	 un 	 	that	bombard	the	earth	with	high	-	speed	 sub 	 atomic 	 	 particle 	 s 	 	.
so	far	,	our	atmosphere	 ha 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	,	and	our	 magnet 	 ic 	 	field	 ha 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	well	 protect 	 ing 	 	us	from	 th 	 is 	 	.
 occasion 	 ally 	 	,	we	get	a	flare	from	the	 s 	 un 	 	that	 cause 	 s 	 	 ha 	 voc 	 	with	 communication 	 s 	 	and	so	forth	,	and	 electric 	 ity 	 	.
but	the	 alarm 	 ing 	 	thing	is	that	 astronomer 	 s 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	 star 	 s 	 	that	are	similar	to	our	 s 	 un 	 	,	and	they	've	found	that	a	number	of	them	,	when	they	're	about	the	age	of	our	 s 	 un 	 	,	 bright 	 en 	 	by	a	factor	of	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	20.	 do 	 es 	 	n't	last	for	 ver 	 y 	 	long	.
and	they	think	these	are	super	-	 flare 	 s 	 	,	 million 	 s 	 	of	 time 	 s 	 	more	 power 	 ful 	 	than	any	 flare 	 s 	 	we	've	had	from	our	 s 	 un 	 	so	far	.
 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	we	do	n't	want	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	.
there	's	a	flip	side	to	it	.	in	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	 star 	 s 	 	like	our	 s 	 un 	 	,	we	've	found	that	they	go	through	 period 	 s 	 	of	diminishment	,	when	 the 	 ir 	 	total	amount	of	energy	that	's	 exp 	 ell 	 ed 	 	from	them	 go 	 es 	 	down	by	 may 	 be 	 	one	percent	.
one	percent	 do 	 es 	 	n't	sound	like	a	lot	,	but	it	would	cause	one	hell	of	an	ice	age	here	.
so	,	what	can	we	do	about	 th 	 is 	 	?
start	 terra 	 form 	 ing 	 	mars	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 subject 	 s 	 	.	i	wrote	a	story	about	 th 	 is 	 	in	life	magazine	in	1993	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	rocket	science	,	but	it	's	not	hard	rocket	science	.
 every 	 thing 	 	that	we	need	to	make	an	atmosphere	on	mars	,	and	to	make	a	 liv 	 able 	 	planet	on	mars	,	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	there	.
and	you	just	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	have	to	 s 	 end 	 	little	nuclear	 factor 	 ies 	 	up	there	that	 go 	 bble 	 	up	the	iron	oxide	on	the	surface	of	mars	and	 s 	 pit 	 	out	the	oxygen	.
the	problem	is	it	 take 	 s 	 	300	 year 	 s 	 	to	terraform	mars	,	 minim 	 um 	 	.
 re 	 ally 	 	more	like	500	 year 	 s 	 	to	do	it	right	.
there	's	no	reason	why	we	should	n't	start	now	.
number	three	--	is	n't	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	cool	?
a	new	global	 epi 	 demic 	 	.	people	have	 be 	 en 	 	at	war	with	 germ 	 s 	 	and	from	time	to	time	,	the	 germ 	 s 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	get	the	upper	hand	.
in	1918	,	we	had	a	flu	 epi 	 demic 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	that	 kill 	 ed 	 	20	million	people	.
that	was	back	when	the	population	was	around	100	million	people	.
the	bubonic	plague	in	europe	,	in	the	middle	 age 	 s 	 	,	 kill 	 ed 	 	one	out	of	four	europeans	.
 aid 	 s 	 	is	coming	back	.	 eb 	 ola 	 	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	 rear 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	head	with	much	too	much	frequency	,	and	old	 disease 	 s 	 	like	cholera	are	 be 	 coming 	 	resistant	to	 anti 	 biotic 	 s 	 	.
we	've	all	 learn 	 ed 	 	what	--	the	kind	of	panic	that	can	occur	when	an	old	disease	 rear 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	head	,	like	 an 	 thra 	 x 	 	.
the	worst	 possibil 	 ity 	 	is	that	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	germ	,	like	 s 	 ta 	 ph 	 	,	for	which	we	have	one	 anti 	 biotic 	 	that	still	 work 	 s 	 	,	 mut 	 ates 	 	.
and	we	know	 s 	 ta 	 ph 	 	can	do	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
a	 s 	 ta 	 ph 	 	cell	can	be	next	to	a	muscle	cell	in	your	body	and	borrow	 gene 	 s 	 	from	it	when	 anti 	 biotic 	 s 	 	come	,	and	change	and	 mut 	 ate 	 	.
the	danger	is	that	some	germ	like	 s 	 ta 	 ph 	 	will	be	--	will	 mut 	 ate 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 virul 	 ent 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 con 	 tag 	 ious 	 	,	and	will	 s 	 weep 	 	through	 population 	 s 	 	before	we	can	do	 any 	 thing 	 	about	it	.
that	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	before	.	about	12,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	there	was	a	massive	wave	of	mammal	 extinct 	 ions 	 	in	the	americas	,	and	that	is	thought	to	have	 be 	 en 	 	a	 virul 	 ent 	 	disease	.
so	,	what	can	we	do	about	it	?
it	is	nuts	.	we	give	 anti 	 biotic 	 s 	 	--	--	every	cow	,	every	lamb	,	every	chicken	,	they	get	 anti 	 biotic 	 s 	 	every	day	,	all	.	you	know	,	you	go	to	a	restaurant	,	you	eat	fish	,	i	got	news	for	you	,	it	's	all	 farm 	 ed 	 	.	you	know	,	you	got	ta	ask	when	you	go	to	a	restaurant	if	it	's	a	wild	fish	,	cause	they	're	not	going	to	tell	you	.	we	're	giving	away	the	code	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	like	 be 	 ing 	 	at	war	and	giving	 some 	 body 	 	your	secret	code	.
we	're	 tell 	 ing 	 	the	 germ 	 s 	 	out	there	how	to	fight	us	.
we	got	ta	fix	that	.	we	got	ta	 out 	 law 	 	that	right	away	.
 second 	 ly 	 	,	our	public	health	system	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	saw	with	 an 	 thra 	 x 	 	,	is	a	real	disaster	.
we	have	a	real	,	major	 out 	 break 	 	of	disease	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	we	are	not	prepared	to	cope	with	it	.
now	,	there	is	money	in	the	federal	budget	,	next	year	,	to	build	up	the	public	health	service	.
but	i	do	n't	think	to	any	 ex 	 tent 	 	that	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 d 	 one 	 	.
number	two	--	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	--	we	meet	a	 r 	 ogue 	 	black	hole	.
you	know	,	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	or	15	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	you	walk	 in 	 to 	 	an	 astro 	 nomy 	 	convention	,	and	you	say	,	``	you	know	,	there	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	a	black	hole	at	the	center	of	every	 galax 	 y 	 	,	``
and	they	're	going	to	hoot	you	off	the	stage	.
and	now	,	if	you	went	 in 	 to 	 	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 convention 	 s 	 	and	you	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	i	do	n't	think	black	 hole 	 s 	 	are	out	there	,	``	they	'd	hoot	you	off	the	stage	.
our	 comprehens 	 ion 	 	of	the	way	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 work 	 s 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	--	 ha 	 s 	 	just	 gain 	 ed 	 	 un 	 believ 	 ably 	 	in	 re 	 cent 	 	 year 	 s 	 	.
we	think	that	there	are	about	10	million	dead	 star 	 s 	 	in	the	 milk 	 y 	 	way	 al 	 one 	 	,	our	 galax 	 y 	 	.
and	these	 star 	 s 	 	have	 compress 	 ed 	 	down	to	 may 	 be 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	12	,	15	 mile 	 s 	 	wide	,	and	they	are	black	 hole 	 s 	 	.	and	they	are	gobbling	up	 every 	 thing 	 	around	them	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	light	,	which	is	why	we	ca	n't	see	them	.
most	of	them	should	be	in	orbit	around	 some 	 thing 	 	.
but	 galax 	 ies 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	violent	 place 	 s 	 	,	and	 thing 	 s 	 	can	be	 s 	 pun 	 	out	of	orbit	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	,	space	is	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	vast	.
so	even	if	you	 f 	 lung 	 	a	million	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	out	of	orbit	,	the	 chance 	 s 	 	that	one	would	 actual 	 ly 	 	hit	us	is	 fair 	 ly 	 	remote	.
but	it	 on 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	get	close	,	about	a	billion	 mile 	 s 	 	away	,	one	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
about	a	billion	 mile 	 s 	 	away	,	here	's	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	earth	's	orbit	:	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 elli 	 pt 	 ical 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 circul 	 ar 	 	.
and	for	three	 month 	 s 	 	out	of	the	year	,	the	surface	 temperature 	 s 	 	go	up	to	150	to	_UNK_	for	three	 month 	 s 	 	out	of	the	year	,	they	go	to	50	 be 	 low 	 	zero	.
that	wo	n't	work	too	well	.	what	can	we	do	about	 th 	 is 	 	?
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	 scar 	 iest 	 	.	i	do	n't	have	a	good	answer	for	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	we	got	ta	think	about	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 colon 	 izing 	 	race	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	number	one	:	 big 	 gest 	 	danger	to	life	 a 	 s 	 	we	know	it	,	i	think	,	a	 re 	 ally 	 	big	 a 	 steroid 	 	 head 	 s 	 	for	earth	.
the	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	to	remember	here	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	question	of	if	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	question	of	when	,	and	how	big	.
in	1908	,	just	a	200	-	foot	piece	of	a	 com 	 et 	 	 explode 	 d 	 	over	siberia	and	 flatten 	 ed 	 	 forest 	 s 	 	for	 may 	 be 	 	100	 mile 	 s 	 	.
it	had	the	effect	of	about	1,000	hiroshima	 bomb 	 s 	 	.
 astronomer 	 s 	 	estimate	that	little	 a 	 steroid 	 s 	 	like	that	come	about	every	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	.
in	1989	,	a	large	 a 	 steroid 	 	 pass 	 ed 	 	400,000	 mile 	 s 	 	away	from	earth	.
 noth 	 ing 	 	to	worry	about	,	right	?
it	 pass 	 ed 	 	 direct 	 ly 	 	through	earth	's	orbit	.	we	 we 	 re 	 	in	that	that	spot	six	 hour 	 s 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	.
a	small	 a 	 steroid 	 	,	say	a	half	mile	wide	,	would	touch	off	firestorms	 follow 	 ed 	 	by	severe	global	 cool 	 ing 	 	from	the	 deb 	 ris 	 	 kick 	 ed 	 	up	--	carl	sagan	's	nuclear	winter	thing	.	an	 a 	 steroid 	 	five	 mile 	 s 	 	wide	 cause 	 s 	 	major	 extinct 	 ions 	 	.	we	think	the	one	that	got	the	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	was	about	five	 mile 	 s 	 	wide	.
where	are	they	?	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	kuiper	belt	,	which	--	some	people	think	pluto	's	not	a	planet	,	that	's	where	pluto	is	,	it	's	in	the	kuiper	belt	.
there	's	 al 	 so 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	a	little	 far 	 ther 	 	out	,	 call 	 ed 	 	the	oort	cloud	.
there	are	about	100,000	 ball 	 s 	 	of	ice	and	rock	--	 come 	 ts 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	--	out	there	,	that	are	50	 mile 	 s 	 	in	 dia 	 meter 	 	or	more	,	and	they	 regular 	 ly 	 	take	a	little	spin	,	in	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	 s 	 un 	 	and	pass	 reason 	 ably 	 	close	to	us	.
of	more	concern	,	i	think	,	is	the	 a 	 steroid 	 s 	 	that	exist	between	mars	and	jupiter	.
the	 folk 	 s 	 	at	the	sloan	digital	sky	survey	told	us	last	fall	--	they	're	making	the	first	map	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	three	-	dimensional	map	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	--	that	there	are	 prob 	 ably 	 	700,000	 a 	 steroid 	 s 	 	between	mars	and	jupiter	that	are	a	half	a	mile	big	or	 big 	 ger 	 	.
so	you	say	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	well	,	what	are	 re 	 ally 	 	the	 chance 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	?
andrew	,	can	you	put	that	chart	up	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	chart	that	dr.	clark	chapman	at	the	 south 	 west 	 	research	institute	 present 	 ed 	 	to	congress	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
you	'll	notice	that	the	chance	of	an	 a 	 steroid 	 	-	 s 	 lash 	 	-	 com 	 et 	 	impact	 kill 	 ing 	 	you	is	about	one	in	20,000	,	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	the	work	they	've	 d 	 one 	 	.
now	look	at	the	one	right	 be 	 low 	 	that	.
passenger	 air 	 craft 	 	crash	,	one	in	20,000	.
we	 s 	 pend 	 	an	awful	lot	of	money	 try 	 ing 	 	to	be	 s 	 ure 	 	that	we	do	n't	die	in	 air 	 plane 	 	 accident 	 s 	 	,	and	we	're	not	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	 hard 	 ly 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	.	and	yet	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 complete 	 ly 	 	 prevent 	 able 	 	.
we	 final 	 ly 	 	have	,	just	in	the	last	year	,	the	technology	to	stop	 th 	 is 	 	cold	.
could	we	have	the	 solution 	 s 	 	?
nasa	's	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	three	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	,	three	million	 buck 	 s 	 	--	that	is	like	pocket	change	--	to	search	for	 a 	 steroid 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	figure	out	every	 a 	 steroid 	 	that	's	out	there	,	and	if	it	might	hit	earth	,	and	when	it	might	hit	earth	.
and	they	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	that	.
but	it	's	going	to	take	them	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	at	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	three	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	,	and	even	then	,	they	claim	they	'll	 on 	 ly 	 	have	about	80	percent	of	them	catalogued	.
 come 	 ts 	 	are	a	 tough 	 er 	 	act	.
we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	have	the	technology	to	predict	 com 	 et 	 	 tra 	 ject 	 ories 	 	,	or	when	one	with	our	name	on	it	might	 arriv 	 e 	 	.
but	we	would	have	 lot 	 s 	 	of	time	,	if	we	see	it	coming	.
we	 re 	 ally 	 	need	a	 dedicate 	 d 	 	 observ 	 atory 	 	.
you	'll	notice	that	a	lot	of	 come 	 ts 	 	are	named	after	people	you	never	heard	of	,	amateur	 astronomer 	 s 	 	?	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	 no 	 body 	 	's	looking	for	them	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	 amateur 	 s 	 	.
we	need	a	 dedicate 	 d 	 	 observ 	 atory 	 	that	 look 	 s 	 	for	 come 	 ts 	 	.
part	two	of	the	 solution 	 s 	 	:	we	need	to	figure	out	how	to	blow	up	an	 a 	 steroid 	 	,	or	alter	 it 	 s 	 	 tra 	 ject 	 ory 	 	.	now	,	a	year	ago	,	we	did	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	thing	.
we	 s 	 ent 	 	a	 prob 	 e 	 	out	to	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 steroid 	 	belt	,	 call 	 ed 	 	near	,	near	earth	 a 	 steroid 	 	rendezvous	.
and	these	 guy 	 s 	 	orbited	a	30	--	or	no	,	about	a	22	-	mile	long	 a 	 steroid 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 ero 	 s 	 	.
and	then	,	of	course	,	you	know	,	they	 pull 	 ed 	 	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	sneaky	nasa	 thing 	 s 	 	,	where	they	had	extra	 batt 	 eries 	 	and	extra	gas	 a 	 board 	 	and	 every 	 thing 	 	,	and	then	,	at	the	last	minute	,	they	 land 	 ed 	 	.	when	the	mission	was	over	,	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	 land 	 ed 	 	on	the	thing	.
we	have	 land 	 ed 	 	a	rocket	ship	on	an	 a 	 steroid 	 	.	it	's	not	a	big	deal	.
now	,	the	trouble	with	just	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	a	bomb	out	for	 th 	 is 	 	thing	is	that	you	do	n't	have	 any 	 thing 	 	to	push	against	in	space	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	no	air	.
a	nuclear	explosion	is	just	 a 	 s 	 	hot	,	but	we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	have	 any 	 thing 	 	big	 en 	 ough 	 	to	melt	a	22	-	mile	long	 a 	 steroid 	 	,
or	vaporize	it	,	would	be	more	like	it	.
but	we	can	learn	to	land	on	these	 a 	 steroid 	 s 	 	that	have	our	name	on	them	and	put	 some 	 thing 	 	like	a	small	ion	 pro 	 pulsion 	 	motor	on	it	,	which	would	 gent 	 ly 	 	,	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	,	after	a	period	of	time	,	push	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	different	 tra 	 ject 	 ory 	 	,	which	,	if	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	our	math	right	,	would	keep	it	from	hitting	earth	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	just	a	matter	of	 find 	 ing 	 	'	em	,	going	there	,	and	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	about	it	.
i	know	your	head	is	 s 	 pinning 	 	from	all	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	.
yikes	!	so	 man 	 y 	 	big	 threat 	 s 	 	!
the	thing	,	i	think	,	to	remember	,	is	september	11	.
we	do	n't	want	to	get	caught	flat	-	footed	 aga 	 in 	 	.
we	know	about	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	.
science	 ha 	 s 	 	the	power	to	predict	the	future	in	 man 	 y 	 	 case 	 s 	 	now	.
knowledge	is	power	.
the	worst	thing	we	can	do	is	say	,	jeez	,	i	got	 en 	 ough 	 	to	worry	about	 with 	 out 	 	 worry 	 ing 	 	about	an	 a 	 steroid 	 	.
that	's	a	 mistak 	 e 	 	that	could	 liter 	 ally 	 	cost	us	our	future	.
thank	you	.
