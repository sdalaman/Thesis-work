 a 	 s 	 	an	artist	,	 connect 	 ion 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	me	.
through	my	work	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	articulate	that	 human 	 s 	 	are	not	 separat 	 e 	 	from	nature	and	that	 every 	 thing 	 	is	 interconnect 	 ed 	 	.
i	first	went	to	antarctica	 al 	 most 	 	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	where	i	saw	my	first	 ice 	 berg 	 s 	 	.
i	was	in	awe	.
my	heart	beat	fast	,	my	head	was	dizzy	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 com 	 prehend 	 	what	it	was	that	stood	in	front	of	me	.
the	 ice 	 berg 	 s 	 	around	me	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 most 	 	200	feet	out	of	the	water	,
and	i	could	 on 	 ly 	 	help	but	wonder	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	one	 snow 	 flake 	 	on	top	of	 an 	 other 	 	 snow 	 flake 	 	,	year	after	year	.
 ice 	 berg 	 s 	 	are	born	when	they	calve	off	of	 glaci 	 ers 	 	or	break	off	of	ice	 shelv 	 es 	 	.
each	 ice 	 berg 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	own	individual	 personal 	 ity 	 	.
they	have	a	distinct	way	of	 interact 	 ing 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	environment	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 experience 	 s 	 	.
some	 re 	 fuse 	 	to	give	up	and	hold	on	to	the	bitter	end	,	while	 other 	 s 	 	ca	n't	take	it	 any 	 more 	 	and	 crumb 	 le 	 	in	a	fit	of	 dramat 	 ic 	 	 pass 	 ion 	 	.
it	's	easy	to	think	,	when	you	look	at	an	 ice 	 berg 	 	,	that	they	're	 isolate 	 d 	 	,	that	they	're	 separat 	 e 	 	and	 al 	 one 	 	,	much	like	we	 a 	 s 	 	 human 	 s 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	view	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
but	the	 re 	 ality 	 	is	far	from	it	.
 a 	 s 	 	an	 ice 	 berg 	 	 melt 	 s 	 	,	i	am	 breath 	 ing 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	ancient	atmosphere	.
 a 	 s 	 	the	 ice 	 berg 	 	 melt 	 s 	 	,	it	is	 re 	 leas 	 ing 	 	mineral	-	rich	fresh	water	that	nourishes	 man 	 y 	 	 form 	 s 	 	of	life	.
i	approach	 photograph 	 ing 	 	these	 ice 	 berg 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	if	i	'm	making	 portrait 	 s 	 	of	my	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	,	 know 	 ing 	 	that	in	these	individual	 moment 	 s 	 	they	exist	in	that	way	and	will	never	exist	that	way	 aga 	 in 	 	.
it	is	not	a	death	when	they	melt	;	it	is	not	an	end	,	but	a	 continu 	 ation 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	path	through	the	cycle	of	life	.
some	of	the	ice	in	the	 ice 	 berg 	 s 	 	that	i	photograph	is	 ver 	 y 	 	young	--	a	couple	thousand	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
and	some	of	the	ice	is	over	100,000	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
the	last	 picture 	 s 	 	i	'd	like	to	show	you	are	of	an	 ice 	 berg 	 	that	i	 photograph 	 ed 	 	in	_UNK_	,	greenland	.
it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	rare	occasion	that	you	get	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	witness	an	 ice 	 berg 	 	 roll 	 ing 	 	.
you	can	see	on	the	left	side	a	small	boat	.
that	's	about	a	15	-	foot	boat	.
and	i	'd	like	you	to	pay	attention	to	the	shape	of	the	 ice 	 berg 	 	and	where	it	is	at	the	 water 	 line 	 	.
you	can	see	here	,	it	 begin 	 s 	 	to	roll	,	and	the	boat	 ha 	 s 	 	 move 	 d 	 	to	the	other	side	,	and	the	man	is	 stand 	 ing 	 	there	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	average	-	 s 	 ize 	 	_UNK_	 ice 	 berg 	 	.
it	's	about	120	feet	above	the	water	,	or	40	 meter 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	video	is	real	time	.
and	just	like	that	,	the	 ice 	 berg 	 	 show 	 s 	 	you	a	different	side	of	 it 	 s 	 	 personal 	 ity 	 	.
thank	you	.
