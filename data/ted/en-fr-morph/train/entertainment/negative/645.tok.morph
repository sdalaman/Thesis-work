do	we	live	in	a	 border 	 less 	 	world	?
before	you	answer	that	,	have	a	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	map	.
 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	 politic 	 al 	 	map	 show 	 s 	 	that	we	have	over	200	 count 	 ries 	 	in	the	world	 to 	 day 	 	.
that	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	more	than	at	any	time	in	centuries	.
now	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	will	object	.
for	you	 th 	 is 	 	would	be	a	more	appropriate	map	.
you	could	call	it	tedistan	.
in	tedistan	,	there	are	no	 border 	 s 	 	,	just	 connect 	 ed 	 	 space 	 s 	 	and	 un 	 connect 	 ed 	 	 space 	 s 	 	.
most	of	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	 re 	 side 	 	in	one	of	the	40	 dot 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	screen	,	of	the	 man 	 y 	 	more	that	represent	90	percent	of	the	world	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
but	let	's	talk	about	the	90	percent	of	the	world	population	that	will	never	 leav 	 e 	 	the	place	in	which	they	 we 	 re 	 	born	.
for	them	,	 nation 	 s 	 	,	 count 	 ries 	 	,	 bound 	 aries 	 	,	 border 	 s 	 	still	matter	a	great	deal	,	and	often	 violent 	 ly 	 	.
now	here	at	ted	,	we	're	solving	some	of	the	great	 riddle 	 s 	 	of	science	and	 myster 	 ies 	 	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
well	here	is	a	fundamental	problem	we	have	not	 solve 	 d 	 	:	our	 bas 	 ic 	 	 politic 	 al 	 	 geo 	 graphy 	 	.
how	do	we	 distribut 	 e 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	around	the	world	?
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	 import 	 ant 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	border	 conflict 	 s 	 	 just 	 ify 	 	so	much	of	the	world	's	 militar 	 y 	 	-	industrial	complex	.
border	 conflict 	 s 	 	can	 de 	 rail 	 	so	much	of	the	progress	that	we	hope	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	here	.
so	i	think	we	need	a	 deep 	 er 	 	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	how	people	,	money	,	power	,	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	culture	,	technology	interact	to	change	the	map	of	the	world	.
and	we	can	try	to	 anticip 	 ate 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 change 	 s 	 	,	and	shape	them	in	a	more	 construct 	 ive 	 	direction	.
so	we	're	going	to	look	at	some	 map 	 s 	 	of	the	past	,	the	present	and	some	 map 	 s 	 	you	have	n't	 s 	 een 	 	in	order	to	get	a	sense	of	where	 thing 	 s 	 	are	going	.
let	's	start	with	the	world	of	1945	.
1945	there	 we 	 re 	 	just	100	 count 	 ries 	 	in	the	world	.
after	world	war	ii	,	europe	was	 deva 	 state 	 d 	 	,	but	still	held	large	 over 	 sea 	 s 	 	 colon 	 ies 	 	:	french	west	africa	,	british	east	africa	,	south	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	,	and	so	forth	.
then	over	the	late	'40s	,	'50s	,	'60s	,	'70s	and	'80s	,	 wave 	 s 	 	of	 de 	 colon 	 ization 	 	took	place	.
over	50	new	 count 	 ries 	 	 we 	 re 	 	born	.
you	can	see	that	africa	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 fragment 	 ed 	 	.
india	,	pakistan	,	bangladesh	,	south	east	asian	 nation 	 s 	 	 create 	 d 	 	.
then	came	the	end	of	the	cold	war	.
the	end	of	the	cold	war	and	the	 dis 	 integ 	 ration 	 	of	the	soviet	 un 	 ion 	 	.
you	had	the	creation	of	new	 state 	 s 	 	in	eastern	europe	,	the	 form 	 er 	 	yugoslav	 re 	 public 	 s 	 	and	the	balkans	,	and	the	'	stans	of	central	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	we	have	200	 count 	 ries 	 	in	the	world	.
the	entire	planet	is	 cover 	 ed 	 	by	sovereign	,	 in 	 dependent 	 	nation	-	 state 	 s 	 	.
 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	that	 some 	 one 	 	's	gain	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 some 	 one 	 	else	's	loss	?
let	's	zoom	in	on	one	of	the	most	 strat 	 egic 	 	 area 	 s 	 	of	the	world	,	eastern	eurasia	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	on	 th 	 is 	 	map	,	russia	is	still	the	largest	country	in	the	world	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	know	,	 chin 	 a 	 	is	the	most	 popu 	 lous 	 	.
and	they	share	a	 length 	 y 	 	land	border	.
what	you	do	n't	see	on	 th 	 is 	 	map	is	that	most	of	russia	's	150	million	people	are	 concent 	 rated 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	western	 pro 	 vince 	 s 	 	and	 area 	 s 	 	that	are	close	to	europe	.
and	 on 	 ly 	 	30	million	people	are	in	 it 	 s 	 	eastern	 area 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	the	world	bank	 predict 	 s 	 	that	russia	's	population	is	 dec 	 lining 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	about	120	million	people	and	there	is	 an 	 other 	 	thing	that	you	do	n't	see	on	 th 	 is 	 	map	.
stalin	,	khrushchev	and	other	soviet	 lead 	 ers 	 	 force 	 d 	 	russians	out	to	the	far	east	to	be	in	 gulag 	 s 	 	,	labor	 camp 	 s 	 	,	nuclear	cities	,	 what 	 ever 	 	the	case	was	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	oil	 price 	 s 	 	rose	,	russian	 government 	 s 	 	have	 invest 	 ed 	 	in	 infra 	 structure 	 	to	 un 	 ite 	 	the	country	,	east	and	west	.
but	 noth 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	more	 per 	 verse 	 ly 	 	 impact 	 ed 	 	russia	's	 demo 	 graphic 	 	 distribut 	 ion 	 	,
 be 	 cause 	 	the	people	in	the	east	,	who	never	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	there	 any 	 way 	 	,	have	gotten	on	 t 	 hose 	 	 train 	 s 	 	and	 road 	 s 	 	and	gone	back	to	the	west	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	result	,	in	the	russian	far	east	 to 	 day 	 	,	which	is	twice	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	india	,	you	have	 exact 	 ly 	 	six	million	russians	.
so	let	's	get	a	sense	of	what	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	part	of	the	world	.
we	can	start	with	mongolia	,	or	 a 	 s 	 	some	call	it	,	mine	-	golia	.
why	do	they	call	it	that	?
 be 	 cause 	 	in	mine	-	golia	,	chinese	 firm 	 s 	 	 oper 	 ate 	 	and	own	most	of	the	 mine 	 s 	 	--	 cop 	 per 	 	,	 z 	 inc 	 	,	gold	--	and	they	truck	the	 resource 	 s 	 	south	and	east	 in 	 to 	 	 main 	 land 	 	 chin 	 a 	 	.
 chin 	 a 	 	is	n't	 conquer 	 ing 	 	mongolia	.	it	's	 buy 	 ing 	 	it	.
 colon 	 ies 	 	 we 	 re 	 	once	 conquer 	 ed 	 	.	 to 	 day 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	are	 b 	 ought 	 	.
so	let	's	 app 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	principle	to	siberia	.
siberia	most	of	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	think	of	 a 	 s 	 	a	cold	,	desolate	,	 un 	 liv 	 able 	 	place	.
but	in	fact	,	with	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	and	 ris 	 ing 	 	 temperature 	 s 	 	,	all	of	a	sudden	you	have	vast	wheat	 field 	 s 	 	and	 agr 	 i 	 business 	 	,	and	grain	 be 	 ing 	 	 produce 	 d 	 	in	siberia	.
but	who	is	it	going	to	feed	?
well	,	just	on	the	other	side	of	the	amo	river	,	in	the	heilongjiang	and	harbin	 pro 	 vince 	 s 	 	of	 chin 	 a 	 	,	you	have	over	100	million	people	.
that	's	 large 	 r 	 	than	the	entire	population	of	russia	.
every	single	year	,	for	at	 l 	 east 	 	a	decade	or	more	,	[	60,000	]	of	them	have	 be 	 en 	 	 vot 	 ing 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	feet	,	 cross 	 ing 	 	,	moving	north	and	 inhabit 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	desolate	 terra 	 in 	 	.
they	set	up	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 bazaar 	 s 	 	and	medical	 clinic 	 s 	 	.
they	've	taken	over	the	timber	industry	and	 be 	 en 	 	 ship 	 ping 	 	the	lumber	east	,	back	 in 	 to 	 	 chin 	 a 	 	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	like	mongolia	,	 chin 	 a 	 	is	n't	 conquer 	 ing 	 	russia	.	it	's	just	 leas 	 ing 	 	it	.
that	's	what	i	call	 global 	 ization 	 	chinese	style	.
now	 may 	 be 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	the	map	of	the	region	might	look	like	in	10	to	20	 year 	 s 	 	.
but	hold	on	.	 th 	 is 	 	map	is	700	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	map	of	the	yuan	 dy 	 nasty 	 	,	led	by	kublai	khan	,	the	 grand 	 son 	 	of	genghis	khan	.
so	 histo 	 ry 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 necess 	 arily 	 	repeat	 it 	 self 	 	,	but	it	 do 	 es 	 	 rhym 	 e 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	just	to	give	you	a	taste	of	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	part	of	the	world	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	 global 	 ization 	 	chinese	style	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 global 	 ization 	 	 open 	 s 	 	up	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	ways	for	us	to	 under 	 mine 	 	and	change	the	way	we	think	about	 politic 	 al 	 	 geo 	 graphy 	 	.	so	,	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	east	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	in	fact	,	people	do	n't	think	about	 nation 	 s 	 	and	 border 	 s 	 	.
they	think	more	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 empire 	 s 	 	and	 hierarch 	 ies 	 	,	 usual 	 ly 	 	chinese	or	japanese	.
well	it	's	 chin 	 a 	 	's	turn	 aga 	 in 	 	.
so	let	's	look	at	how	 chin 	 a 	 	is	re	-	 establish 	 ing 	 	that	 hierarch 	 y 	 	in	the	far	east	.
it	 start 	 s 	 	with	the	global	 hub 	 s 	 	.
remember	the	40	 dot 	 s 	 	on	the	 night 	 time 	 	map	that	show	the	 hub 	 s 	 	of	the	global	 eco 	 nomy 	 	?
east	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	 to 	 day 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	more	of	 t 	 hose 	 	global	 hub 	 s 	 	than	any	other	region	in	the	world	.
tokyo	,	seoul	,	beijing	,	shanghai	,	hong	kong	,	singapore	and	sidney	.
these	are	the	 filter 	 s 	 	and	 funnel 	 s 	 	of	global	capital	.
 trillion 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	region	,
so	much	of	it	 be 	 ing 	 	 invest 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 chin 	 a 	 	.
then	there	is	trade	.
these	 vector 	 s 	 	and	 arrow 	 s 	 	represent	ever	 strong 	 er 	 	trade	 relationship 	 s 	 	that	 chin 	 a 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	with	every	country	in	the	region	.
 specific 	 ally 	 	,	it	 target 	 s 	 	japan	and	korea	and	australia	,	 count 	 ries 	 	that	are	strong	 al 	 lies 	 	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
australia	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	is	 heav 	 ily 	 	dependent	on	 export 	 ing 	 	iron	ore	and	natural	gas	to	 chin 	 a 	 	.
for	 poor 	 er 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	 chin 	 a 	 	 reduc 	 es 	 	 ta 	 riff 	 s 	 	so	that	laos	and	cambodia	can	sell	 the 	 ir 	 	 good 	 s 	 	more	 cheap 	 ly 	 	and	 be 	 come 	 	dependent	on	 export 	 ing 	 	to	 chin 	 a 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
and	now	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	have	 be 	 en 	 	 read 	 ing 	 	in	the	news	how	people	are	looking	to	 chin 	 a 	 	to	lead	the	 re 	 bound 	 	,	the	economic	 re 	 bound 	 	,	not	just	in	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	,	but	 potential 	 ly 	 	for	the	world	.
the	asian	free	trade	zone	,	 al 	 most 	 	free	trade	zone	,	that	's	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	now	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 great 	 er 	 	trade	volume	than	trade	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	.
so	 chin 	 a 	 	is	 be 	 coming 	 	the	anchor	of	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	in	the	region	.
 an 	 other 	 	pillar	of	 th 	 is 	 	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	is	 diploma 	 cy 	 	.
 chin 	 a 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 sign 	 ed 	 	 militar 	 y 	 	 agree 	 ments 	 	with	 man 	 y 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	in	the	region	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	the	hub	of	 diplomat 	 ic 	 	 institution 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	east	asian	community	.
some	of	these	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	do	n't	even	have	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	member	.
there	is	a	 treat 	 y 	 	of	 non 	 aggress 	 ion 	 	between	 count 	 ries 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	that	if	there	 we 	 re 	 	a	conflict	between	 chin 	 a 	 	and	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	most	 count 	 ries 	 	vow	to	just	 s 	 it 	 	it	out	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	american	 al 	 lies 	 	like	korea	and	australia	.
 an 	 other 	 	pillar	of	the	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	,	like	russia	,	is	 demo 	 graphic 	 	.
 chin 	 a 	 	 export 	 s 	 	business	people	,	 nann 	 ies 	 	,	 student 	 s 	 	,	 teacher 	 s 	 	to	teach	chinese	around	the	region	,	to	 inter 	 marry 	 	and	to	occupy	ever	 great 	 er 	 	 command 	 ing 	 	 height 	 s 	 	of	the	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	.
 al 	 ready 	 	ethnic	chinese	people	in	malaysia	,	thailand	and	indonesia	are	the	real	key	 factor 	 s 	 	and	 driver 	 s 	 	in	the	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	there	.
chinese	 pri 	 de 	 	is	 resurg 	 ent 	 	in	the	region	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	.
singapore	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	used	to	ban	chinese	language	education	.
now	it	 encourag 	 es 	 	it	.
if	you	add	it	all	up	what	do	you	get	?
well	,	if	you	remember	before	world	war	ii	,	japan	had	a	vision	for	a	 great 	 er 	 	japanese	co	-	 prosper 	 ity 	 	sphere	.
what	's	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	 to 	 day 	 	is	what	you	might	call	a	 great 	 er 	 	chinese	co	-	 prosper 	 ity 	 	sphere	.
so	no	matter	what	the	lines	on	the	map	tell	you	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 nation 	 s 	 	and	 border 	 s 	 	,	what	you	 re 	 ally 	 	have	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	in	the	far	east	are	national	 culture 	 s 	 	,	but	in	a	much	more	fluid	,	imperial	zone	.
all	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 fir 	 ing 	 	a	shot	.
that	's	most	 certain 	 ly 	 	not	the	case	in	the	middle	east	where	 count 	 ries 	 	are	still	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	in	the	 border 	 s 	 	left	 be 	 hind 	 	by	european	 colonial 	 ists 	 	.
so	what	can	we	do	to	think	about	 border 	 s 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	part	of	the	world	?
what	lines	on	the	map	should	we	focus	on	?
what	i	want	to	present	to	you	is	what	i	call	state	building	,	day	by	day	.
let	's	start	with	 ir 	 aq 	 	.
six	 year 	 s 	 	after	the	u.s.	invasion	of	 ir 	 aq 	 	,	the	country	still	 exist 	 s 	 	more	on	a	map	than	it	 do 	 es 	 	in	 re 	 ality 	 	.
oil	used	to	be	one	of	the	 force 	 s 	 	 hold 	 ing 	 	 ir 	 aq 	 	together	;	now	it	is	the	most	significant	cause	of	the	country	's	 dis 	 integ 	 ration 	 	.
the	reason	is	kurdistan	.
the	kurds	for	3,000	 year 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 w 	 aging 	 	a	struggle	for	 in 	 depend 	 ence 	 	,
and	now	is	 the 	 ir 	 	chance	to	 final 	 ly 	 	have	it	.
these	are	 pipe 	 line 	 	 route 	 s 	 	,	which	emerge	from	kurdistan	,	which	is	an	oil	-	rich	region	.
and	 to 	 day 	 	,	if	you	go	to	kurdistan	,	you	'll	see	that	kurdish	peshmerga	 guerilla 	 s 	 	are	 s 	 quar 	 ing 	 	off	against	the	sunni	iraqi	 arm 	 y 	 	.
but	what	are	they	 guard 	 ing 	 	?
is	it	 re 	 ally 	 	a	border	on	the	map	?
no	.	it	's	the	 pipe 	 lines 	 	.
if	the	kurds	can	control	 the 	 ir 	 	 pipe 	 lines 	 	,	they	can	set	the	 term 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 state 	 hood 	 	.
now	should	we	be	 up 	 set 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	about	the	potential	 dis 	 integ 	 ration 	 	of	 ir 	 aq 	 	?
i	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	we	should	.
 ir 	 aq 	 	will	still	be	the	second	largest	oil	 produce 	 r 	 	in	the	world	,	 be 	 hind 	 	saudi	arabia	.
and	we	'll	have	a	chance	to	solve	a	3,000	year	old	 disput 	 e 	 	.
now	remember	kurdistan	is	 land 	 lock 	 ed 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	no	choice	but	to	 behav 	 e 	 	.
in	order	to	profit	from	 it 	 s 	 	oil	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	export	it	through	 tur 	 key 	 	or	syria	,	and	other	 count 	 ries 	 	,	and	 ir 	 aq 	 	 it 	 self 	 	.
and	 there 	 fore 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	have	 ami 	 cable 	 	 relation 	 s 	 	with	them	.
now	lets	look	at	a	 pe 	 rennial 	 	conflict	in	the	region	.	that	is	,	of	course	,	in	palestine	.
palestine	is	 some 	 thing 	 	of	a	 car 	 to 	 graphic 	 	 anomal 	 y 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	two	 part 	 s 	 	palestinian	,	one	part	israel	.
30	 year 	 s 	 	of	rose	garden	 diploma 	 cy 	 	have	not	 deliver 	 ed 	 	us	peace	in	 th 	 is 	 	conflict	.
what	might	?	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	what	might	solve	the	problem	is	 infra 	 structure 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	 donor 	 s 	 	are	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
these	two	 arrow 	 s 	 	are	an	arc	,	an	arc	of	 commute 	 r 	 	 rail 	 road 	 s 	 	and	other	 infra 	 structure 	 	that	link	the	west	bank	and	gaza	.
if	gaza	can	have	a	 function 	 ing 	 	port	and	be	linked	to	the	west	bank	,	you	can	have	a	 vi 	 able 	 	palestinian	state	,	palestinian	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
that	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	is	going	to	 br 	 ing 	 	peace	to	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	conflict	.
the	 less 	 on 	 	from	kurdistan	and	from	palestine	is	that	 in 	 depend 	 ence 	 	 al 	 one 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	 infra 	 structure 	 	,	is	 fu 	 tile 	 	.
now	what	might	 th 	 is 	 	entire	region	look	like	if	in	fact	we	focus	on	other	lines	on	the	map	 be 	 side 	 s 	 	 border 	 s 	 	,	when	the	 in 	 securities 	 	might	 ab 	 ate 	 	?
the	last	time	that	was	the	case	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	century	ago	,	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	ottoman	empire	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	hejaz	 rail 	 way 	 	.
the	hejaz	 rail 	 way 	 	ran	from	istanbul	to	medina	via	damascus	.	it	even	had	an	 off 	 shoot 	 	running	to	haifa	in	what	is	 to 	 day 	 	israel	,	on	the	mediterranean	sea	.
but	 to 	 day 	 	the	hejaz	 rail 	 way 	 	lies	in	 tat 	 ter 	 s 	 	,	 ruin 	 s 	 	.
if	we	 we 	 re 	 	to	focus	on	 re 	 construct 	 ing 	 	these	 curv 	 y 	 	lines	on	the	map	,	 infra 	 structure 	 	,	that	cross	the	straight	lines	,	the	 border 	 s 	 	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	the	middle	east	would	be	a	far	more	 peace 	 ful 	 	region	.
now	let	's	look	at	 an 	 other 	 	part	of	the	world	,	the	 form 	 er 	 	soviet	 re 	 public 	 s 	 	of	central	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	,	the	'	stans	.
these	 count 	 ries 	 	'	 border 	 s 	 	 origin 	 ate 	 	from	stalin	's	 decr 	 ees 	 	.
he	 purpose 	 ly 	 	did	not	want	these	 count 	 ries 	 	to	make	sense	.
he	 want 	 ed 	 	 ethnic 	 ities 	 	to	mingle	in	ways	that	would	allow	him	to	divide	and	rule	.
 fortunate 	 ly 	 	for	them	,	most	of	 the 	 ir 	 	oil	and	gas	 resource 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	after	the	soviet	 un 	 ion 	 	 collapse 	 d 	 	.
now	i	know	some	of	you	may	be	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	oil	,	oil	,	oil	.
why	is	it	all	he	's	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	is	oil	?	``
well	,	there	is	a	big	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	the	way	we	used	to	talk	about	oil	and	the	way	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	it	now	.
before	it	was	,	how	do	we	control	 the 	 ir 	 	oil	?
now	it	's	 the 	 ir 	 	oil	for	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 purpose 	 s 	 	.
and	i	assure	you	it	's	every	bit	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	them	 a 	 s 	 	it	might	have	 be 	 en 	 	to	 colon 	 izer 	 s 	 	and	 imperial 	 ists 	 	.
here	are	just	some	of	the	 pipe 	 line 	 	 project 	 ions 	 	and	 possibil 	 ities 	 	and	 scenario 	 s 	 	and	 route 	 s 	 	that	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 ma 	 pped 	 	out	for	the	next	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 decade 	 s 	 	.
a	great	deal	of	them	.
for	a	number	of	 count 	 ries 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	part	of	the	world	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	 pipe 	 lines 	 	is	the	ticket	to	 be 	 coming 	 	part	of	the	global	 eco 	 nomy 	 	and	for	 hav 	 ing 	 	some	meaning	 be 	 side 	 s 	 	the	 border 	 s 	 	that	they	are	not	loyal	to	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
just	take	azerbaijan	.
azerbaijan	was	a	 for 	 gotten 	 	corner	of	the	caucuses	,
but	now	with	the	baku	-	tbilisi	-	ceyhan	 pipe 	 line 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 tur 	 key 	 	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 re 	 brand 	 ed 	 	 it 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 front 	 ier 	 	of	the	west	.
then	there	is	turkmenistan	,	which	most	people	think	of	 a 	 s 	 	a	 froze 	 n 	 	basket	case	.
but	now	it	's	 con 	 trib 	 uting 	 	gas	 a 	 cross 	 	the	caspian	sea	to	provide	for	europe	,	and	even	a	 potential 	 ly 	 	turkmen	-	afghan	-	pakistan	-	india	 pipe 	 line 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
then	there	is	kazakhstan	,	which	did	n't	even	have	a	name	before	.
it	was	more	 consider 	 ed 	 	south	siberia	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	soviet	 un 	 ion 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	most	people	 recogn 	 ize 	 	kazakhstan	 a 	 s 	 	an	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	 geo 	 politic 	 al 	 	player	.	why	?
 be 	 cause 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 shrewd 	 ly 	 	designed	 pipe 	 lines 	 	to	flow	 a 	 cross 	 	the	caspian	,	north	through	russia	,	and	even	east	to	 chin 	 a 	 	.
more	 pipe 	 lines 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	more	silk	 road 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	the	great	game	.
the	great	game	 con 	 note 	 s 	 	 domin 	 ance 	 	of	one	over	the	other	.
silk	road	 con 	 note 	 s 	 	 in 	 depend 	 ence 	 	and	mutual	trust	.
the	more	 pipe 	 lines 	 	we	have	,	the	more	silk	 road 	 s 	 	we	'll	have	,	and	the	less	of	a	 domin 	 ant 	 	great	game	 com 	 petition 	 	we	'll	have	in	the	21st	century	.
now	let	's	look	at	the	 on 	 ly 	 	part	of	the	world	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	down	 it 	 s 	 	 border 	 s 	 	,	and	how	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 enhance 	 d 	 	 it 	 s 	 	strength	.
and	that	is	,	of	course	,	europe	.
the	european	 un 	 ion 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	 a 	 s 	 	just	the	coal	and	steel	community	of	six	 count 	 ries 	 	,
and	 the 	 ir 	 	main	purpose	was	 re 	 ally 	 	to	keep	the	 rehabilit 	 ation 	 	of	germany	to	happen	in	a	 peace 	 ful 	 	way	.
but	then	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	it	grew	 in 	 to 	 	12	 count 	 ries 	 	,
and	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	12	 star 	 s 	 	on	the	european	flag	.
the	e.u	.	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 came 	 	a	 curr 	 ency 	 	block	,	and	is	now	the	most	 power 	 ful 	 	trade	block	in	the	entire	world	.
on	average	,	the	e.u	.	 ha 	 s 	 	grown	by	one	country	per	year	since	the	end	of	the	cold	war	.
in	fact	most	of	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	on	just	one	day	.
in	2004	,	15	new	 count 	 ries 	 	 join 	 ed 	 	the	e.u	.
and	now	you	have	what	most	people	consider	a	zone	of	peace	 span 	 ning 	 	27	 count 	 ries 	 	and	450	million	people	.
so	what	is	next	?	what	is	the	future	of	the	european	 un 	 ion 	 	?
well	in	light	blue	,	you	see	the	 zone 	 s 	 	or	the	 region 	 s 	 	that	are	at	 l 	 east 	 	two	-	 third 	 s 	 	or	more	dependent	on	the	european	 un 	 ion 	 	for	trade	and	 invest 	 ment 	 	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	that	tell	us	?	trade	and	 invest 	 ment 	 	tell	us	that	europe	is	 put 	 ting 	 	 it 	 s 	 	money	where	 it 	 s 	 	mouth	is	.
even	if	these	 region 	 s 	 	are	n't	part	of	the	e.u	.	,	they	are	 be 	 coming 	 	part	of	 it 	 s 	 	sphere	of	influence	.
just	take	the	balkans	.	croatia	,	serbia	bosnia	,	they	're	not	 member 	 s 	 	of	the	e.u	.	yet	.
but	you	can	get	on	a	german	ice	train	and	make	it	 al 	 most 	 	to	albania	.
in	bosnia	you	use	the	euro	 curr 	 ency 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	,	and	that	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 curr 	 ency 	 	they	're	 prob 	 ably 	 	ever	going	to	have	.
so	,	looking	at	other	 part 	 s 	 	of	europe	's	 per 	 iph 	 ery 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	north	africa	.
on	average	,	every	year	or	two	,	a	new	oil	or	gas	 pipe 	 line 	 	 open 	 s 	 	up	under	the	mediterranean	,	 connect 	 ing 	 	north	africa	to	europe	.
that	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 help 	 s 	 	europe	diminish	 it 	 s 	 	 reli 	 ance 	 	on	russia	for	energy	,	but	if	you	travel	to	north	africa	 to 	 day 	 	,	you	'll	hear	more	and	more	people	 say 	 ing 	 	that	they	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	think	of	 the 	 ir 	 	region	 a 	 s 	 	the	middle	east	.
so	in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 p 	 resident 	 	sarkozy	of	france	is	right	when	he	 talk 	 s 	 	about	a	mediterranean	 un 	 ion 	 	.
now	let	's	look	at	 tur 	 key 	 	and	the	caucasus	.
i	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	azerbaijan	before	.
that	corridor	of	 tur 	 key 	 	and	the	caucasus	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	the	conduit	for	20	percent	of	europe	's	energy	supply	.
so	 do 	 es 	 	 tur 	 key 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	have	to	be	a	member	of	the	european	 un 	 ion 	 	?
i	do	n't	think	it	 do 	 es 	 	.	i	think	it	's	 al 	 ready 	 	part	of	a	euro	-	turkish	 super 	 power 	 	.
so	what	's	next	?	where	are	we	going	to	see	 border 	 s 	 	change	and	new	 count 	 ries 	 	born	?
well	,	south	central	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	,	south	west	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	place	to	start	.
eight	 year 	 s 	 	after	the	u.s.	 invad 	 ed 	 	afghanistan	there	is	still	a	tremendous	amount	of	 in 	 st 	 ability 	 	.
pakistan	and	afghanistan	are	still	so	fragile	that	 n 	 either 	 	of	them	have	 deal 	 t 	 	 construct 	 ively 	 	with	the	problem	of	pashtun	 national 	 ism 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	flag	that	flies	in	the	 mind 	 s 	 	of	20	million	pashtuns	who	live	on	both	 side 	 s 	 	of	the	afghan	and	pakistan	border	.
let	's	not	neglect	the	insurgency	just	to	the	south	,
balochistan	.	two	 week 	 s 	 	ago	,	balochi	 rebel 	 s 	 	 attack 	 ed 	 	a	pakistani	 militar 	 y 	 	 gar 	 ris 	 on 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	flag	that	they	raised	over	it	.
the	post	-	colonial	 ent 	 ropy 	 	that	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	around	the	world	is	 accele 	 rating 	 	,
and	i	expect	more	 s 	 uch 	 	 change 	 s 	 	to	occur	in	the	map	 a 	 s 	 	the	 state 	 s 	 	fragment	.
of	course	,	we	ca	n't	forget	africa	.
53	 count 	 ries 	 	,	and	by	far	the	most	number	of	 suspicious 	 ly 	 	straight	lines	on	the	map	.
if	we	 we 	 re 	 	to	look	at	all	of	africa	we	could	most	 certain 	 ly 	 	 acknowledg 	 e 	 	far	more	,	 trib 	 al 	 	 division 	 s 	 	and	so	forth	.
but	let	's	just	look	at	sudan	,	the	second	-	largest	country	in	africa	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	three	 on 	 going 	 	civil	 war 	 s 	 	,	the	genocide	in	darfur	,	which	you	all	know	about	,	the	civil	war	in	the	east	of	the	country	,	and	south	sudan	.
south	sudan	is	going	to	be	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	 refer 	 end 	 um 	 	in	2011	in	which	it	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 like 	 ly 	 	to	vote	 it 	 self 	 	 in 	 depend 	 ence 	 	.
now	let	's	go	up	to	the	 arc 	 tic 	 	circle	.
there	is	a	great	race	on	for	energy	 resource 	 s 	 	under	the	 arc 	 tic 	 	 sea 	 bed 	 	.
who	will	win	?	canada	?	russia	?	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	?
 actual 	 ly 	 	greenland	.
 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 week 	 s 	 	ago	greenland	's	[	60,000	]	people	 vot 	 ed 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	self	-	 govern 	 ance 	 	 right 	 s 	 	from	denmark	.
so	denmark	is	about	to	get	a	whole	lot	 small 	 er 	 	.
what	is	the	 less 	 on 	 	from	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	?
 geo 	 politic 	 s 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 sentiment 	 al 	 	discipline	.	it	's	 constant 	 ly 	 	 morph 	 ing 	 	and	changing	the	world	,	like	climate	change	.
and	like	our	relationship	with	the	 eco 	 system 	 	we	're	 al 	 ways 	 	 search 	 ing 	 	for	equilibrium	in	how	we	divide	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	planet	.
now	we	fear	 change 	 s 	 	on	the	map	.
we	fear	civil	 war 	 s 	 	,	death	 toll 	 s 	 	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	learn	the	 name 	 s 	 	of	new	 count 	 ries 	 	.
but	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	the	 in 	 ertia 	 	of	the	 exist 	 ing 	 	 border 	 s 	 	that	we	have	 to 	 day 	 	is	far	 wo 	 rse 	 	and	far	more	violent	.
the	question	is	how	do	we	change	 t 	 hose 	 	 border 	 s 	 	,	and	what	lines	do	we	focus	on	?
i	 believ 	 e 	 	we	focus	on	the	lines	that	cross	 border 	 s 	 	,	the	 infra 	 structure 	 	lines	.	then	we	'll	wind	up	with	the	world	we	want	,	a	 border 	 less 	 	one	.
thank	you	.
