so	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	i	 start 	 ed 	 	a	program	to	try	to	get	the	 rock 	 star 	 	tech	and	design	people	to	take	a	year	off	and	work	in	the	one	environment	that	 represent 	 s 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 every 	 thing 	 	they	're	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	hate	;	we	have	them	work	in	government	.
the	program	is	 call 	 ed 	 	code	for	america	,	and	it	's	a	little	bit	like	a	peace	 corp 	 s 	 	for	 geek 	 s 	 	.	we	select	a	few	 fellow 	 s 	 	every	year	and	we	have	them	work	with	city	 government 	 s 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	them	off	 in 	 to 	 	the	third	world	,	we	 s 	 end 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	the	_UNK_	of	city	hall	.
and	there	they	make	great	 app 	 s 	 	,	they	work	with	city	staffers	.
but	 re 	 ally 	 	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	is	they	're	 show 	 ing 	 	what	's	possible	with	technology	 to 	 day 	 	.
so	meet	al	.
al	is	a	fire	hydrant	in	the	city	of	boston	.
here	it	kind	of	 look 	 s 	 	like	he	's	looking	for	a	date	,	but	what	he	's	 re 	 ally 	 	looking	for	is	for	 some 	 one 	 	to	 shove 	 l 	 	him	out	when	he	 get 	 s 	 	 snow 	 ed 	 	in	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 know 	 s 	 	he	's	not	 ver 	 y 	 	good	at	 fight 	 ing 	 	 fire 	 s 	 	when	he	's	 cover 	 ed 	 	in	four	feet	of	snow	.
now	how	did	he	come	to	be	looking	for	help	in	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 ique 	 	manner	?
we	had	a	team	of	 fellow 	 s 	 	in	boston	last	year	through	the	code	for	america	program	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	there	in	february	,	and	it	 snow 	 ed 	 	a	lot	in	february	last	year	.
and	they	 notice 	 d 	 	that	the	city	never	 get 	 s 	 	to	 dig 	 ging 	 	out	these	fire	 hydrant 	 s 	 	.
but	one	fellow	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	a	guy	named	erik	_UNK_	-	_UNK_	,	 notice 	 d 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	else	,	and	that	's	that	 citizen 	 s 	 	are	 shove 	 ling 	 	out	 side 	 walk 	 s 	 	right	in	front	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
so	he	did	what	any	good	 develop 	 er 	 	would	do	,	he	wrote	an	app	.
it	's	a	cute	little	app	where	you	can	adopt	a	fire	hydrant	.
so	you	agree	to	dig	it	out	when	it	 snow 	 s 	 	.
if	you	do	,	you	get	to	name	it	,
and	he	 call 	 ed 	 	the	first	one	al	.
and	if	you	do	n't	,	 some 	 one 	 	can	steal	it	from	you	.
so	it	's	got	cute	little	game	 dynamic 	 s 	 	on	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	modest	little	app	.
it	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	 small 	 est 	 	of	the	21	 app 	 s 	 	that	the	 fellow 	 s 	 	wrote	last	year	.
but	it	's	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	no	other	government	technology	 do 	 es 	 	.
it	's	 spread 	 ing 	 	 viral 	 ly 	 	.
there	's	a	guy	in	the	i.t	.	 depart 	 ment 	 	of	the	city	of	_UNK_	who	saw	 th 	 is 	 	app	and	 real 	 ized 	 	that	he	could	use	it	,	not	for	snow	,	but	to	get	 citizen 	 s 	 	to	adopt	tsunami	 siren 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	that	these	tsunami	 siren 	 s 	 	work	,	but	people	steal	the	 batt 	 eries 	 	out	of	them	.
so	he	's	 get 	 ting 	 	 citizen 	 s 	 	to	check	on	them	.
and	then	seattle	 decide 	 d 	 	to	use	it	to	get	 citizen 	 s 	 	to	clear	out	 clog 	 ged 	 	storm	 drain 	 s 	 	.
and	chicago	just	 roll 	 ed 	 	it	out	to	get	people	to	sign	up	to	 shove 	 l 	 	 side 	 walk 	 s 	 	when	it	 snow 	 s 	 	.
so	we	now	know	of	nine	cities	that	are	 plan 	 ning 	 	to	use	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	spread	just	frictionlessly	,	 organ 	 ically 	 	,	 natural 	 ly 	 	.
if	you	know	 any 	 thing 	 	about	government	technology	,	you	know	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	how	it	 normal 	 ly 	 	 go 	 es 	 	.
_UNK_	 soft 	 ware 	 	 usual 	 ly 	 	 take 	 s 	 	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
we	had	a	team	that	 work 	 ed 	 	on	a	project	in	boston	last	year	that	took	three	people	about	two	and	a	half	 month 	 s 	 	.
it	was	a	way	that	 parent 	 s 	 	could	figure	out	which	 we 	 re 	 	the	right	public	 school 	 s 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	told	 after 	 ward 	 	that	if	that	had	gone	through	normal	 channel 	 s 	 	,	it	would	have	taken	at	 l 	 east 	 	two	 year 	 s 	 	and	it	would	have	cost	about	two	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
there	is	one	project	in	the	california	court	system	right	now	that	so	far	cost	 taxpayer 	 s 	 	two	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	.
and	there	are	 project 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	at	every	level	of	government	.
so	an	app	that	 take 	 s 	 	a	couple	of	 day 	 s 	 	to	write	and	then	 spread 	 s 	 	 viral 	 ly 	 	,	that	's	sort	of	a	shot	 a 	 cross 	 	the	bow	to	the	institution	of	government	.
it	 suggest 	 s 	 	how	government	could	work	better	--	not	more	like	a	private	company	,	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	think	it	should	.
and	not	even	like	a	tech	company	,	but	more	like	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 it 	 self 	 	.
and	that	 mean 	 s 	 	permissionless	,	it	 mean 	 s 	 	open	,	it	 mean 	 s 	 	generative	.
and	that	's	 import 	 ant 	 	.
but	what	's	more	 import 	 ant 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	app	is	that	it	 represent 	 s 	 	how	a	new	generation	is	 tack 	 ling 	 	the	problem	of	government	--	not	 a 	 s 	 	the	problem	of	an	_UNK_	institution	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	a	problem	of	 collect 	 ive 	 	action	.
and	that	's	great	news	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	good	at	 collect 	 ive 	 	action	with	digital	technology	.
now	there	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	large	community	of	people	that	are	building	the	 tool 	 s 	 	that	we	need	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	together	 effective 	 ly 	 	.
it	's	not	just	code	for	america	 fellow 	 s 	 	,	there	are	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	people	all	over	the	country	that	are	 stand 	 ing 	 	and	writing	civic	 app 	 s 	 	every	day	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 commun 	 ities 	 	.
they	have	n't	 give 	 n 	 	up	on	government	.
they	are	 frust 	 rated 	 	 a 	 s 	 	hell	with	it	,	but	they	're	not	 complain 	 ing 	 	about	it	,	they	're	 fix 	 ing 	 	it	.
and	these	 folk 	 s 	 	know	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	've	lost	sight	of	.
and	that	's	that	when	you	strip	away	all	your	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	about	 politic 	 s 	 	and	the	line	at	the	dmv	and	all	 t 	 hose 	 	other	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	mad	about	,	government	is	,	at	 it 	 s 	 	core	,	in	the	 word 	 s 	 	of	tim	o'reilly	,	``	what	we	do	together	that	we	ca	n't	do	 al 	 one 	 	.	``	now	a	lot	of	people	have	 give 	 n 	 	up	on	government	.
and	if	you	're	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	people	,	i	would	ask	that	you	 re 	 consider 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	are	changing	.
 politic 	 s 	 	is	not	changing	;	government	is	changing	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	government	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	 deriv 	 es 	 	 it 	 s 	 	power	from	us	--	remember	``	we	the	people	?	``	--	how	we	think	about	it	is	going	to	effect	how	that	change	 happen 	 s 	 	.
now	i	did	n't	know	 ver 	 y 	 	much	about	government	when	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	program	.
and	like	a	lot	of	people	,	i	thought	government	was	 bas 	 ically 	 	about	 get 	 ting 	 	people	 elect 	 ed 	 	to	 off 	 ice 	 	.
well	after	two	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	've	come	to	the	 con 	 clusion 	 	that	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	local	government	,	is	about	opossums	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	call	center	for	the	 service 	 s 	 	and	information	line	.
it	's	 general 	 ly 	 	where	you	will	get	if	you	call	311	in	your	city	.
if	you	should	ever	have	the	chance	to	staff	your	city	's	call	center	,	 a 	 s 	 	our	fellow	scott	silverman	did	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	the	program	--	in	fact	,	they	all	do	that	--	you	will	find	that	people	call	government	with	a	 ver 	 y 	 	wide	range	of	 issue 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	an	opossum	 s 	 tuck 	 	in	your	house	.
so	scott	 get 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	call	.
he	 type 	 s 	 	``	opossum	``	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	official	knowledge	base	.
he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	come	up	with	 any 	 thing 	 	.	he	 start 	 s 	 	with	animal	control	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	look	,	can	you	just	open	all	the	 door 	 s 	 	to	your	house	and	play	music	 re 	 ally 	 	loud	and	see	if	the	thing	 leav 	 es 	 	?	``	so	that	 work 	 ed 	 	.	so	_UNK_	for	scott	.
but	that	was	n't	the	end	of	the	opossums	.
boston	 do 	 es 	 	n't	just	have	a	call	center	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	an	app	,	a	web	and	mobile	app	,	 call 	 ed 	 	 citizen 	 s 	 	connect	.
now	we	did	n't	write	 th 	 is 	 	app	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	work	of	the	 ver 	 y 	 	smart	people	at	the	 off 	 ice 	 	of	new	urban	 mechanic 	 s 	 	in	boston	.
so	one	day	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	actual	report	--	 th 	 is 	 	came	in	:	``	opossum	in	my	 trash 	 can 	 	.	ca	n't	tell	if	it	's	dead	.
how	do	i	get	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	?	``	but	what	 happen 	 s 	 	with	 citizen 	 s 	 	connect	is	different	.
so	scott	was	 s 	 peaking 	 	person	-	to	-	person	.
but	on	 citizen 	 s 	 	connect	 every 	 thing 	 	is	public	,	so	 every 	 body 	 	can	see	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	a	neighbor	saw	it	.
and	the	next	report	we	got	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	 walk 	 ed 	 	over	to	 th 	 is 	 	location	,	found	the	 trash 	 can 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	the	house	.
opossum	?	check	.	living	?	 y 	 ep 	 	.
 turn 	 ed 	 	 trash 	 can 	 	on	 it 	 s 	 	side	.	 walk 	 ed 	 	home	.
 good 	 night 	 	sweet	opossum	.	``
 pre 	 tty 	 	simple	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	great	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	digital	 meet 	 ing 	 	the	physical	.
and	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	great	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	government	 get 	 ting 	 	in	on	the	crowd	-	sourcing	game	.
but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	great	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	government	 a 	 s 	 	a	platform	.
and	i	do	n't	mean	 necess 	 arily 	 	a	 techno 	 logical 	 	definition	of	platform	here	.
i	'm	just	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	a	platform	for	people	to	help	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	to	help	 other 	 s 	 	.
so	one	citizen	 help 	 ed 	 	 an 	 other 	 	citizen	,	but	government	 play 	 ed 	 	a	key	role	here	.
it	 connect 	 ed 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	two	people	.
and	it	could	have	 connect 	 ed 	 	them	with	government	 service 	 s 	 	if	they	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	,	but	a	neighbor	is	a	far	better	and	 cheap 	 er 	 	 alter 	 native 	 	to	government	 service 	 s 	 	.
when	one	neighbor	 help 	 s 	 	 an 	 other 	 	,	we	 strength 	 en 	 	our	 commun 	 ities 	 	.
we	call	animal	control	,	it	just	 cost 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	money	.
now	one	of	the	 import 	 ant 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	we	need	to	think	about	government	is	that	it	's	not	the	same	thing	 a 	 s 	 	 politic 	 s 	 	.
and	most	people	get	that	,	but	they	think	that	one	is	the	 in 	 put 	 	to	the	other	.
that	our	 in 	 put 	 	to	the	system	of	government	is	 vot 	 ing 	 	.
now	how	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	have	we	 elect 	 ed 	 	a	 politic 	 al 	 	 lead 	 er 	 	--	and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	we	 s 	 pend 	 	a	lot	of	energy	 get 	 ting 	 	a	new	 politic 	 al 	 	 lead 	 er 	 	 elect 	 ed 	 	--	and	then	we	 s 	 it 	 	back	and	we	expect	government	to	reflect	our	 value 	 s 	 	and	meet	our	 need 	 s 	 	,	and	then	not	that	much	 change 	 s 	 	?
that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	government	is	like	a	vast	ocean	and	 politic 	 s 	 	is	the	six	-	inch	layer	on	top	.
and	what	's	under	that	is	what	we	call	 bureau 	 cracy 	 	.
and	we	say	that	word	with	 s 	 uch 	 	 con 	 tempt 	 	.
but	it	's	that	 con 	 tempt 	 	that	 keep 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	thing	that	we	own	and	we	pay	for	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	 work 	 ing 	 	against	us	,	 th 	 is 	 	other	thing	,	and	then	we	're	disempowering	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
people	seem	to	think	 politic 	 s 	 	is	sexy	.
if	we	want	 th 	 is 	 	institution	to	work	for	us	,	we	're	going	to	have	to	make	 bureau 	 cracy 	 	sexy	.
 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	where	the	real	work	of	government	 happen 	 s 	 	.
we	have	to	engage	with	the	 machine 	 ry 	 	of	government	.
so	that	's	_UNK_	 move 	 ment 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	.
have	you	 s 	 een 	 	these	 guy 	 s 	 	?
it	's	a	group	of	 concern 	 ed 	 	 citizen 	 s 	 	that	have	written	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 detail 	 ed 	 	325	-	page	report	that	's	a	 respons 	 e 	 	to	the	sec	's	request	for	comment	on	the	financial	reform	bill	.
that	's	not	 be 	 ing 	 	 politic 	 ally 	 	active	,	that	's	 be 	 ing 	 	bureaucratically	active	.
now	for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	us	who	've	 give 	 n 	 	up	on	government	,	it	's	time	that	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	about	the	world	that	we	want	to	 leav 	 e 	 	for	our	children	.
you	have	to	see	the	enormous	 challeng 	 es 	 	that	they	're	going	to	face	.
do	we	 re 	 ally 	 	think	we	're	going	to	get	where	we	need	to	go	 with 	 out 	 	 fix 	 ing 	 	the	one	institution	that	can	act	on	 be 	 half 	 	of	all	of	us	?
we	ca	n't	do	 with 	 out 	 	government	,	but	we	do	need	it	to	be	more	effective	.
the	good	news	is	that	technology	is	making	it	possible	to	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	 re 	 frame 	 	the	function	of	government	in	a	way	that	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	scale	by	 strength 	 en 	 ing 	 	civil	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
and	there	's	a	generation	out	there	that	's	grown	up	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	and	they	know	that	it	's	not	that	hard	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	together	,	you	just	have	to	architect	the	 system 	 s 	 	the	right	way	.
now	the	average	age	of	our	 fellow 	 s 	 	is	28	,
so	i	am	,	_UNK_	,	 al 	 most 	 	a	generation	 old 	 er 	 	than	most	of	them	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	generation	that	's	grown	up	taking	 the 	 ir 	 	 voice 	 s 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	.
they	're	not	 fight 	 ing 	 	that	battle	that	we	're	all	 fight 	 ing 	 	about	who	 get 	 s 	 	to	speak	;	they	all	get	to	speak	.
they	can	express	 the 	 ir 	 	opinion	on	any	channel	at	any	time	,	and	they	do	.
so	when	they	're	 face 	 d 	 	with	the	problem	of	government	,	they	do	n't	care	 a 	 s 	 	much	about	using	 the 	 ir 	 	 voice 	 s 	 	.
they	're	using	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	.
they	're	using	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	to	write	 application 	 s 	 	that	make	government	work	better	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	 application 	 s 	 	let	us	use	our	 hand 	 s 	 	to	make	our	 commun 	 ities 	 	better	.
that	could	be	 shove 	 ling 	 	out	a	hydrant	,	 pull 	 ing 	 	a	weed	,	 turn 	 ing 	 	over	a	garbage	can	with	an	opossum	in	it	.
and	 certain 	 ly 	 	,	we	could	have	 be 	 en 	 	 shove 	 ling 	 	out	 t 	 hose 	 	fire	 hydrant 	 s 	 	all	 a 	 long 	 	,	and	 man 	 y 	 	people	do	.
but	these	 app 	 s 	 	are	like	little	digital	 re 	 mind 	 ers 	 	that	we	're	not	just	 consumer 	 s 	 	,	and	we	're	not	just	 consumer 	 s 	 	of	government	,	 put 	 ting 	 	in	our	 tax 	 es 	 	and	 get 	 ting 	 	back	 service 	 s 	 	.
we	're	more	than	that	,	we	're	 citizen 	 s 	 	.
and	we	're	not	going	to	fix	government	 un 	 til 	 	we	fix	 citizen 	 ship 	 	.
so	the	question	i	have	for	all	of	you	here	:	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	the	big	,	 import 	 ant 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	need	to	do	together	,	all	of	us	together	,	are	we	just	going	to	be	a	crowd	of	 voice 	 s 	 	,	or	are	we	 al 	 so 	 	going	to	be	a	crowd	of	 hand 	 s 	 	?
