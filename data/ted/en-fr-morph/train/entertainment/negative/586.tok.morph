a	month	ago	 to 	 day 	 	i	stood	there	:
90	 degree 	 s 	 	south	,	the	top	of	the	bottom	of	the	world	,	the	 geo 	 graphic 	 	south	pole	.
and	i	stood	there	 be 	 side 	 	two	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 friend 	 s 	 	of	mine	,	richard	weber	and	kevin	vallely	.
together	we	had	just	broken	the	world	speed	record	for	a	trek	to	the	south	pole	.
it	took	us	33	 day 	 s 	 	,	23	 hour 	 s 	 	and	55	 minute 	 s 	 	to	get	there	.
we	 s 	 have 	 d 	 	five	 day 	 s 	 	off	the	previous	best	time	.
and	in	the	process	,	i	 be 	 came 	 	the	first	person	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	to	make	the	entire	650	-	mile	journey	,	from	hercules	 in 	 let 	 	to	south	pole	,	 sole 	 ly 	 	on	feet	,	 with 	 out 	 	 ski 	 s 	 	.
now	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	are	 prob 	 ably 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	wait	a	sec	,	is	 th 	 is 	 	tough	to	do	?	``
imagine	,	if	you	will	,	 drag 	 ging 	 	a	 s 	 led 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	just	saw	in	that	video	clip	,	with	170	 pound 	 s 	 	of	gear	,	in	it	 every 	 thing 	 	you	need	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	on	your	antarctic	trek	.
it	's	going	to	be	40	 be 	 low 	 	,	every	single	day	.
you	'll	be	in	a	massive	 head 	 wind 	 	.
and	at	some	point	you	're	going	to	have	to	cross	these	 crack 	 s 	 	in	the	ice	,	these	 crevasse 	 s 	 	.
some	of	them	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 pre 	 car 	 ious 	 	thin	 foot 	 bridge 	 	 under 	 neath 	 	them	that	could	give	way	at	a	moment	's	notice	,	taking	your	 s 	 led 	 	,	you	,	 in 	 to 	 	the	abyss	,	never	to	be	 s 	 een 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
the	 punch 	 line 	 	to	your	journey	?	look	at	the	horizon	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	it	's	 up 	 hill 	 	the	entire	way	,
 be 	 cause 	 	the	south	pole	is	at	10,000	feet	,
and	you	're	 start 	 ing 	 	at	sea	level	.
our	journey	did	not	,	in	fact	,	begin	at	hercules	 in 	 let 	 	,	where	 froze 	 n 	 	ocean	 meet 	 s 	 	the	land	of	antarctica	.
it	 beg 	 an 	 	a	little	less	than	two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
a	couple	of	 bud 	 dies 	 	of	mine	and	i	had	 finish 	 ed 	 	a	111	-	day	run	 a 	 cross 	 	the	entire	sahara	desert	.
and	while	we	 we 	 re 	 	there	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	the	 serious 	 ness 	 	of	the	water	crisis	in	 north 	 ern 	 	africa	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 issue 	 s 	 	facing	the	people	of	 north 	 ern 	 	africa	 affect 	 ed 	 	young	people	the	most	.
i	came	home	to	my	wife	after	111	 day 	 s 	 	of	running	in	the	sand	,
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	,	there	's	no	doubt	if	 th 	 is 	 	 bo 	 zo 	 	can	get	 a 	 cross 	 	the	desert	,	we	are	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 do 	 ing 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	we	set	our	 mind 	 s 	 	to	.	``
but	if	i	'm	going	to	 continu 	 e 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	these	 adventure 	 s 	 	,	there	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	a	reason	for	me	to	do	them	beyond	just	 get 	 ting 	 	there	.
around	that	time	i	met	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 	,	peter	thum	,	who	inspired	me	with	his	 action 	 s 	 	.
he	's	 try 	 ing 	 	to	find	and	solve	water	 issue 	 s 	 	,	the	crisis	around	the	world	.
his	 d 	 ed 	 ic 	 ation 	 	inspired	me	to	come	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 	:
a	run	to	the	south	pole	where	,	with	an	 inter 	 active 	 	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	i	will	be	able	to	 br 	 ing 	 	young	people	,	 student 	 s 	 	and	 teacher 	 s 	 	from	around	the	world	on	board	the	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 	with	me	,	 a 	 s 	 	active	 member 	 s 	 	.
so	we	would	have	a	live	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	that	every	single	day	of	the	33	 day 	 s 	 	,	we	would	be	 b 	 logging 	 	,	 tell 	 ing 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	of	,	you	know	,	 deplete 	 d 	 	 o 	 zone 	 	forcing	us	to	cover	our	 face 	 s 	 	,	or	we	will	burn	.
 cross 	 ing 	 	 mile 	 s 	 	and	 mile 	 s 	 	of	sastrugi	--	 froze 	 n 	 	ice	 snow 	 drift 	 s 	 	that	could	be	hip	-	deep	.
i	'm	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	,	 cross 	 ing 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	with	170	-	pound	 s 	 led 	 	,	that	 s 	 led 	 	may	 a 	 s 	 	well	have	 weigh 	 ed 	 	1,700	 pound 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	what	it	felt	like	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 b 	 logging 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	live	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	 dai 	 ly 	 	to	these	 student 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 track 	 ing 	 	us	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	about	10	-	hour	 trek 	 king 	 	 day 	 s 	 	,	15	-	hour	 trek 	 king 	 	 day 	 s 	 	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	20	 hour 	 s 	 	of	 trek 	 king 	 	 dai 	 ly 	 	to	meet	our	goal	.
we	'd	catch	cat	-	naps	at	40	 be 	 low 	 	on	our	 s 	 led 	 	,	 incident 	 ally 	 	.
in	turn	,	 student 	 s 	 	,	people	from	around	the	world	,	would	ask	us	 question 	 s 	 	.
young	people	would	ask	the	most	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 question 	 s 	 	.
one	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	:	it	's	40	 be 	 low 	 	,	you	've	got	to	go	to	the	 bath 	 room 	 	,	where	are	you	going	to	go	and	how	are	you	going	to	do	it	?
i	'm	not	going	to	answer	that	.	but	i	will	answer	some	of	the	more	popular	 question 	 s 	 	.
where	do	you	sleep	?	we	slept	in	a	tent	that	was	 ver 	 y 	 	low	to	the	ground	,
 be 	 cause 	 	the	 wind 	 s 	 	on	antarctica	 we 	 re 	 	so	 extrem 	 e 	 	,	it	would	blow	 any 	 thing 	 	else	away	.
what	do	you	eat	?	one	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 dish 	 es 	 	on	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 	:	butter	and	 ba 	 con 	 	.	it	's	about	a	million	 calorie 	 s 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 burn 	 ing 	 	about	8,500	a	day	,
so	we	 need 	 ed 	 	it	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	 batt 	 eries 	 	do	you	carry	for	all	the	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	that	you	have	?
 virtual 	 ly 	 	 non 	 e 	 	.	all	of	our	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	film	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	,	was	charged	by	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
and	do	you	get	 a 	 long 	 	?	i	 certain 	 ly 	 	hope	so	,
 be 	 cause 	 	at	some	point	or	 an 	 other 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 	,	one	of	your	 team 	 mate 	 s 	 	is	going	to	have	to	take	a	 ver 	 y 	 	big	needle	,	and	put	it	in	an	 infect 	 ed 	 	 bli 	 ster 	 	,	and	drain	it	for	you	.
but	 serious 	 ly 	 	,	 serious 	 ly 	 	,	we	did	get	 a 	 long 	 	,
 be 	 cause 	 	we	had	a	common	goal	of	 want 	 ing 	 	to	inspire	these	young	people	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	our	 team 	 mate 	 s 	 	!	they	 we 	 re 	 	inspiring	us	.

we	 arriv 	 ed 	 	at	the	south	pole	.	we	 huddl 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	that	tent	,	45	 be 	 low 	 	that	day	,	i	'll	never	forget	it	.
we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	each	other	with	these	 look 	 s 	 	of	 dis 	 belief 	 	at	what	we	had	just	 complete 	 d 	 	.
and	i	remember	looking	at	the	 guy 	 s 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	what	do	i	take	from	 th 	 is 	 	journey	?	``	you	know	?	 serious 	 ly 	 	.
