we	do	not	invest	in	 victim 	 s 	 	,	we	invest	in	 surviv 	 ors 	 	.
and	in	ways	both	big	and	small	,	the	narrative	of	the	victim	 shape 	 s 	 	the	way	we	see	women	.
you	ca	n't	count	what	you	do	n't	see	.
and	we	do	n't	invest	in	what	's	 in 	 visible 	 	to	us	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	face	of	 resili 	 ence 	 	.
six	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	writing	about	women	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	and	after	conflict	.
i	set	out	to	write	a	 compel 	 ling 	 	economic	story	,	one	that	had	great	 character 	 s 	 	,	that	no	one	else	was	 tell 	 ing 	 	,	and	one	that	i	thought	 matter 	 ed 	 	.
and	that	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	women	.
i	had	left	abc	news	and	a	 care 	 er 	 	i	 love 	 d 	 	at	the	age	of	30	for	business	school	,	a	path	i	 k 	 new 	 	 al 	 most 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	about	.
 non 	 e 	 	of	the	women	i	had	grown	up	with	in	maryland	had	 graduate 	 d 	 	from	college	,	let	 al 	 one 	 	 consider 	 ed 	 	business	school	.
but	they	had	hustled	to	feed	 the 	 ir 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	and	pay	 the 	 ir 	 	rent	.
and	i	saw	from	a	young	age	that	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	 de 	 cent 	 	job	and	 earn 	 ing 	 	a	good	living	made	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 	for	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	.
so	if	you	're	going	to	talk	about	 job 	 s 	 	,	then	you	have	to	talk	about	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	.
and	if	you	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	in	conflict	and	post	-	conflict	 setting 	 s 	 	,	then	you	must	talk	about	women	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	the	population	you	have	left	.
rwanda	in	the	 im 	 mediate 	 	 after 	 math 	 	of	the	genocide	was	77	percent	female	.
i	want	to	 introduc 	 e 	 	you	to	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	i	've	met	and	share	with	you	some	of	what	they	've	taught	me	over	the	 year 	 s 	 	.
i	went	to	afghanistan	in	2005	to	work	on	a	financial	 time 	 s 	 	piece	,	and	there	i	met	kamila	,	a	young	women	who	told	me	she	had	just	 turn 	 ed 	 	down	a	job	with	the	 inter 	 national 	 	community	that	would	have	paid	her	 near 	 ly 	 	$	2,000	a	month	--	an	astronomical	sum	in	that	 con 	 text 	 	.
and	she	had	 turn 	 ed 	 	it	down	,	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	she	was	going	to	start	her	next	business	,	an	 entrepreneur 	 ship 	 	 consult 	 ancy 	 	that	would	teach	business	 skill 	 s 	 	to	men	and	women	all	around	afghanistan	.
business	,	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	was	critical	to	her	country	's	future	.
 be 	 cause 	 	long	after	 th 	 is 	 	round	of	internationals	left	,	business	would	help	keep	her	country	 peace 	 ful 	 	and	secure	.	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	business	was	even	more	 import 	 ant 	 	for	women	 be 	 cause 	 	 earn 	 ing 	 	an	income	 earn 	 ed 	 	respect	and	money	was	power	for	women	.
so	i	was	 amaz 	 ed 	 	.
i	mean	here	was	a	girl	who	had	never	lived	in	peace	time	who	 some 	 how 	 	had	come	to	sound	like	a	 candid 	 ate 	 	from	``	the	apprentice	.	``
so	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	her	,	``	how	in	the	world	do	you	know	 th 	 is 	 	much	about	business	?
why	are	you	so	passionate	?	``	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	oh	gayle	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	my	third	business	.
my	first	business	was	a	dressmaking	business
i	 start 	 ed 	 	under	the	taliban	.
and	that	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	an	 excel 	 lent 	 	business	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 provide 	 d 	 	 job 	 s 	 	for	women	all	around	our	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	.
and	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	how	i	 be 	 came 	 	an	entrepreneur	.	``	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	:	here	 we 	 re 	 	 girl 	 s 	 	who	 brave 	 d 	 	danger	to	 be 	 come 	 	 bread 	 winner 	 s 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	 year 	 s 	 	in	which	they	could	n't	even	be	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 street 	 s 	 	.
and	at	a	time	of	economic	collapse	when	people	 s 	 old 	 	baby	 doll 	 s 	 	and	shoe	 lace 	 s 	 	and	 window 	 s 	 	and	 door 	 s 	 	just	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	,	these	 girl 	 s 	 	made	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	 surviv 	 al 	 	and	 starv 	 ation 	 	for	so	 man 	 y 	 	.
i	could	n't	 leav 	 e 	 	the	story	,	and	i	could	n't	 leav 	 e 	 	the	 top 	 ic 	 	either	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 every 	 where 	 	i	went	i	met	more	of	these	women	who	no	one	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	know	about	,	or	even	wish	to	.
i	went	on	to	bosnia	,	and	early	on	in	my	 interview 	 s 	 	i	met	with	an	imf	official	who	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	,	gayle	,	i	do	n't	think	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	women	in	business	in	bosnia	,	but	there	is	a	 lad 	 y 	 	selling	cheese	 near 	 by 	 	on	the	side	of	the	road	.
so	 may 	 be 	 	you	could	interview	her	.	``	so	i	went	out	 report 	 ing 	 	and	 with 	 in 	 	a	day	i	met	narcisa	kavazovic	who	at	that	point	was	 open 	 ing 	 	a	new	 factor 	 y 	 	on	the	war	's	 form 	 er 	 	front	lines	in	sarajevo	.
she	had	 start 	 ed 	 	her	business	 squat 	 ting 	 	in	an	 abandon 	 ed 	 	 gar 	 age 	 	,	 sew 	 ing 	 	 sheet 	 s 	 	and	 pil 	 low 	 	 case 	 s 	 	she	would	take	to	 market 	 s 	 	all	around	the	city	so	that	she	could	support	the	12	or	13	family	 member 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	 count 	 ing 	 	on	her	for	 surviv 	 al 	 	.
by	the	time	we	met	,	she	had	20	 employ 	 ees 	 	,	most	of	them	women	,	who	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 boy 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 girl 	 s 	 	to	school	.
and	she	was	just	the	start	.
i	met	women	running	essential	 oil 	 s 	 	 business 	 es 	 	,	wineries	and	even	the	country	's	largest	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	 age 	 ncy 	 	.
so	these	 st 	 ories 	 	together	 be 	 came 	 	the	herald	tribune	business	cover	.
and	when	 th 	 is 	 	story	 post 	 ed 	 	,	i	ran	to	my	computer	to	 s 	 end 	 	it	to	the	imf	official	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	just	in	case	you	're	looking	for	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	to	feature	at	your	next	 invest 	 ment 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	,	here	are	a	couple	of	women	.	``	but	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
the	imf	official	is	 hard 	 ly 	 	the	 on 	 ly 	 	person	to	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	file	women	under	micro	.
the	 bias 	 es 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	intentional	or	 other 	 wise 	 	,	are	pervasive	,	and	so	are	the	 mis 	 lead 	 ing 	 	mental	 image 	 s 	 	.
if	you	see	the	word	``	 micro 	 finance 	 	,	``	what	 come 	 s 	 	to	mind	?
most	people	say	women	.
and	if	you	see	the	word	``	entrepreneur	,	``	most	people	think	men	.
why	is	that	?
 be 	 cause 	 	we	aim	low	and	we	think	small	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	women	.
 micro 	 finance 	 	is	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	tool	that	 lead 	 s 	 	to	self	-	sufficiency	and	self	-	respect	,	but	we	must	move	beyond	micro	-	 hope 	 s 	 	and	micro	-	 ambit 	 ions 	 	for	women	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	have	so	much	 great 	 er 	 	 hope 	 s 	 	for	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
they	want	to	move	from	micro	to	medium	and	beyond	.
and	in	 man 	 y 	 	 place 	 s 	 	,	they	're	there	.
in	the	u.s.	,	women	-	owned	 business 	 es 	 	will	create	five	and	a	half	million	new	 job 	 s 	 	by	2018	.
in	south	korea	and	indonesia	,	women	own	 near 	 ly 	 	half	a	million	 firm 	 s 	 	.
 chin 	 a 	 	,	women	run	20	percent	of	all	small	 business 	 es 	 	.
and	in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	 over 	 all 	 	,	that	figure	is	40	to	50	percent	.
 near 	 ly 	 	 every 	 where 	 	i	go	,	i	meet	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	who	are	seeking	access	to	finance	,	access	to	 market 	 s 	 	and	 establish 	 ed 	 	business	 network 	 s 	 	.
they	are	often	 ignor 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 hard 	 er 	 	to	help	.
it	is	much	 risk 	 ier 	 	to	give	a	50,000	dollar	loan	than	it	is	to	give	a	500	dollar	loan	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	the	world	bank	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 not 	 ed 	 	,	women	are	 s 	 tuck 	 	in	a	 product 	 ivity 	 	trap	.
 t 	 hose 	 	in	small	 business 	 es 	 	ca	n't	get	the	capital	they	need	to	expand	and	 t 	 hose 	 	in	microbusiness	ca	n't	grow	out	of	them	.
 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	i	was	at	the	state	 depart 	 ment 	 	in	washington	and	i	met	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	passionate	entrepreneur	from	ghana	.
she	 sell 	 s 	 	 chocolate 	 s 	 	.
and	she	had	come	to	washington	,	not	seeking	a	 hand 	 out 	 	and	not	seeking	a	microloan	.
she	had	come	seeking	serious	 invest 	 ment 	 	 dollar 	 s 	 	so	that	she	could	build	the	 factor 	 y 	 	and	buy	the	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	she	 need 	 s 	 	to	export	her	 chocolate 	 s 	 	to	africa	,	europe	,	the	middle	east	and	far	beyond	--	capital	that	would	help	her	to	employ	more	than	the	20	people	that	she	 al 	 ready 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	for	her	,	and	capital	that	would	fuel	her	own	country	's	economic	climb	.
the	great	news	is	we	 al 	 ready 	 	know	what	 work 	 s 	 	.
 theor 	 y 	 	and	 empir 	 ical 	 	evidence	have	 al 	 ready 	 	taught	us	.
we	do	n't	need	to	invent	 solution 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	them	--	cash	flow	 loan 	 s 	 	based	in	income	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 asset 	 s 	 	,	 loan 	 s 	 	that	use	secure	 contract 	 s 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 col 	 lateral 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	women	often	do	n't	own	land	.
and	kiva.org	,	the	microlender	,	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	now	 experiment 	 ing 	 	with	 crowd 	 sourcing 	 	small	and	medium	sized	 loan 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	just	to	start	.
 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	in	fashion	to	call	women	``	the	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	market	of	the	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	market	.	``
i	think	that	is	 terr 	 ific 	 	.
you	know	why	?
 be 	 cause 	 	--	and	i	say	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 body 	 	who	 work 	 ed 	 	in	finance	--	500	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	at	 l 	 east 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	 in 	 to 	 	the	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	 market 	 s 	 	in	the	past	decade	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 invest 	 ors 	 	saw	the	potential	for	return	at	a	time	of	 s 	 low 	 ing 	 	economic	growth	,	and	so	they	 create 	 d 	 	financial	 product 	 s 	 	and	financial	 innov 	 ation 	 	 tailor 	 ed 	 	to	the	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	 market 	 s 	 	.
how	 wonder 	 ful 	 	would	it	be	if	we	 we 	 re 	 	prepared	to	replace	all	of	our	lofty	 word 	 s 	 	with	our	 wallet 	 s 	 	and	invest	500	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	 unleash 	 ing 	 	women	's	economic	potential	?
just	think	of	the	 benefit 	 s 	 	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	 job 	 s 	 	,	 product 	 ivity 	 	,	 employ 	 ment 	 	,	child	nutrition	,	 ma 	 ternal 	 	 mortal 	 ity 	 	,	 liter 	 acy 	 	and	much	,	much	more	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	world	economic	forum	 not 	 ed 	 	,	 small 	 er 	 	gender	 gap 	 s 	 	are	 direct 	 ly 	 	 correlate 	 d 	 	with	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	economic	 competitive 	 ness 	 	.
and	not	one	country	in	all	the	world	 ha 	 s 	 	 eliminate 	 d 	 	 it 	 s 	 	economic	 particip 	 ation 	 	gap	--	not	one	.
so	the	great	news	is	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 in 	 credible 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
we	have	so	much	room	to	grow	.
so	you	see	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	about	 do 	 ing 	 	good	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	about	global	growth	and	global	 employ 	 ment 	 	.
it	is	about	how	we	invest	and	it	's	about	how	we	see	women	.
and	women	can	no	 long 	 er 	 	be	both	half	the	population	and	a	special	interest	group	.
 often 	 time 	 s 	 	i	get	 in 	 to 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 discuss 	 ions 	 	with	 report 	 ers 	 	who	say	to	me	,	``	gayle	,	these	are	great	 st 	 ories 	 	,	but	you	're	 re 	 ally 	 	writing	about	the	 exception 	 s 	 	.	``	now	that	 make 	 s 	 	me	pause	for	just	a	couple	 reason 	 s 	 	.
first	of	all	,	for	 exception 	 s 	 	,	there	are	a	lot	of	them	and	they	're	 import 	 ant 	 	.
 second 	 ly 	 	,	when	we	talk	about	men	who	are	 succeed 	 ing 	 	,	we	 right 	 ly 	 	consider	them	 icon 	 s 	 	or	 pioneer 	 s 	 	or	 innov 	 ators 	 	to	be	emulated	.
and	when	we	talk	about	women	,	they	are	either	 exception 	 s 	 	to	be	 dismiss 	 ed 	 	or	aberrations	to	be	 ignor 	 ed 	 	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	there	is	no	 socie 	 ty 	 	 any 	 where 	 	in	all	the	world	that	is	not	 change 	 d 	 	 ex 	 cept 	 	by	 it 	 s 	 	most	 exception 	 al 	 	.
so	why	would	n't	we	 celebr 	 ate 	 	and	 elev 	 ate 	 	these	change	makers	and	job	 creator 	 s 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	overlook	them	?
 th 	 is 	 	 top 	 ic 	 	of	 resili 	 ence 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	personal	to	me	and	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	 ha 	 s 	 	shaped	my	life	.
my	mom	was	a	single	mom	who	 work 	 ed 	 	at	the	phone	company	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	day	and	 s 	 old 	 	tupperware	at	night	so	that	i	could	have	every	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	possible	.
we	shopped	double	 coup 	 on 	 s 	 	and	layaway	and	consignment	 store 	 s 	 	,	and	when	she	got	sick	with	stage	four	breast	cancer	and	could	no	 long 	 er 	 	work	,	we	even	 appli 	 ed 	 	for	food	 stamp 	 s 	 	.
and	when	i	would	feel	sorry	for	 my 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	nine	or	10	year	-	old	 girl 	 s 	 	do	,	she	would	say	to	me	,	``	my	dear	,	on	a	scale	of	major	world	 tra 	 ged 	 ies 	 	,	 your 	 s 	 	is	not	a	three	.	``	and	when	i	was	 app 	 ly 	 ing 	 	to	business	school	and	felt	certain	i	could	n't	do	it	and	 no 	 body 	 	i	 k 	 new 	 	had	 d 	 one 	 	it	,	i	went	to	my	aunt	who	 surviv 	 ed 	 	 year 	 s 	 	of	beatings	at	the	hand	of	her	husband	and	 es 	 cap 	 ed 	 	a	marriage	of	abuse	with	 on 	 ly 	 	her	dignity	 in 	 tact 	 	.
and	she	told	me	,	``	never	import	other	people	's	 limit 	 ations 	 	.	``	and	when	i	 complain 	 ed 	 	to	my	 grand 	 mother 	 	,	a	world	war	ii	veteran	who	 work 	 ed 	 	in	film	for	50	 year 	 s 	 	and	who	 support 	 ed 	 	me	from	the	age	of	13	,	that	i	was	 terr 	 ified 	 	that	if	i	 turn 	 ed 	 	down	a	plum	 assign 	 ment 	 	at	abc	for	a	 fellow 	 ship 	 	 over 	 sea 	 s 	 	,	i	would	never	ever	,	ever	find	 an 	 other 	 	job	,	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	kiddo	,	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	two	 thing 	 s 	 	.
first	of	all	,	no	one	 turn 	 s 	 	down	a	fulbright	,	and	 second 	 ly 	 	,	mcdonald	's	is	 al 	 ways 	 	 hir 	 ing 	 	.	``	``	you	will	find	a	job	.	take	the	leap	.	``	the	women	in	my	family	are	not	 exception 	 s 	 	.
the	women	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	and	 watch 	 ing 	 	in	l.a.	and	all	around	the	world	are	not	 exception 	 s 	 	.
we	are	not	a	special	interest	group	.
we	are	the	 major 	 ity 	 	.
and	for	far	too	long	,	we	have	 under 	 estimate 	 d 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	 be 	 en 	 	undervalued	by	 other 	 s 	 	.
it	is	time	for	us	to	aim	 high 	 er 	 	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	women	,	to	invest	more	and	to	deploy	our	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	benefit	women	all	around	the	world	.
we	can	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	,	and	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	,	not	just	for	women	,	but	for	a	global	 eco 	 nomy 	 	that	 desperate 	 ly 	 	 need 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 con 	 trib 	 ution 	 s 	 	.
together	we	can	make	certain	that	the	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	 exception 	 s 	 	begin	to	rule	.
when	we	change	the	way	we	see	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	 other 	 s 	 	will	follow	.
