i	have	had	the	distinct	 bless 	 ing 	 	in	my	life	to	have	 work 	 ed 	 	on	a	bunch	of	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 project 	 s 	 	.
but	the	 cool 	 est 	 	i	ever	 work 	 ed 	 	on	was	around	 th 	 is 	 	guy	.
 th 	 is 	 	guy	's	name	is	tempt	.
tempt	was	one	of	the	 fore 	 most 	 	graffiti	 artist 	 s 	 	in	the	80s	.
and	he	came	up	home	from	a	run	one	day	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	dad	,	my	 leg 	 s 	 	are	 ting 	 ling 	 	.	``	and	that	was	the	 on 	 set 	 	of	als	.
so	tempt	is	now	 complete 	 ly 	 	 paralyze 	 d 	 	.
he	 on 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	use	of	his	 eye 	 s 	 	.
i	was	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	to	him	.
i	have	a	company	that	 do 	 es 	 	design	and	 anim 	 ation 	 	,	so	 obvious 	 ly 	 	graffiti	is	 definite 	 ly 	 	an	 intric 	 ate 	 	part	of	what	we	admire	and	respect	in	the	art	world	.
and	so	we	 decide 	 d 	 	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	sponsor	tony	,	tempt	,	and	his	cause	.
so	i	went	and	met	with	his	brother	and	father	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	're	going	to	give	you	 th 	 is 	 	money	.
what	are	you	going	to	do	with	it	?	``	and	his	brother	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	just	want	to	be	able	to	talk	to	tony	 aga 	 in 	 	.
i	just	want	to	be	able	to	communicate	with	him	and	him	to	be	able	to	communicate	with	me	.	``	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	wait	a	second	,	is	n't	that	--	i	've	 s 	 een 	 	stephen	 hawk 	 ing 	 	--	do	n't	all	 paralyze 	 d 	 	people	have	the	ability	to	communicate	via	these	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	?	``	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	 un 	 less 	 	you	're	in	the	upper	_UNK_	and	you	've	got	 re 	 ally 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 insur 	 ance 	 	,	you	ca	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	that	.
these	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	are	n't	 access 	 ible 	 	to	people	.	``	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	how	do	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	communicate	?	``	 ha 	 s 	 	 every 	 one 	 	 s 	 een 	 	the	movie	``	the	 div 	 ing 	 	bell	and	the	 butter 	 fly 	 	?	``	that	's	how	they	communicate	--	so	run	 the 	 ir 	 	finger	 a 	 long 	 	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	that	's	 arch 	 a 	 ic 	 	.	how	can	that	be	?	``	so	i	 show 	 ed 	 	up	with	the	 desir 	 e 	 	to	just	write	a	check	,	and	 in 	 stead 	 	,	i	wrote	a	check	that	i	had	no	 freak 	 ing 	 	idea	how	i	was	going	to	cash	.
i	 commit 	 ted 	 	to	his	brother	and	his	father	right	then	and	there	--	i	'm	like	,	``	all	right	,	here	's	the	deal	:	tony	's	going	to	speak	,	we	're	going	to	get	him	a	machine	,	and	we	're	going	to	figure	out	a	way	for	him	to	do	his	art	 aga 	 in 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	a	_UNK_	that	 some 	 one 	 	who	still	 ha 	 s 	 	all	of	that	in	him	is	n't	able	to	communicate	it	.	``	so	i	spoke	at	a	 con 	 ference 	 	a	couple	 month 	 s 	 	after	that	.
i	met	these	 guy 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	_UNK_	,	graffiti	research	lab	,	and	they	have	a	technology	that	 allow 	 s 	 	them	to	project	a	light	onto	any	surface	and	then	,	with	a	laser	 point 	 er 	 	,	draw	on	it	,	and	it	just	 register 	 s 	 	the	negative	space	.
so	they	go	around	and	do	art	 install 	 ations 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
all	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	go	up	there	,	they	 s 	 aid 	 	there	's	a	life	cycle	.
first	it	 start 	 s 	 	with	the	sexual	 organ 	 s 	 	,	then	it	 start 	 s 	 	with	 cus 	 s 	 	 word 	 s 	 	,	then	it	was	bush	_UNK_	and	then	people	 actual 	 ly 	 	got	to	art	.
but	there	was	 al 	 ways 	 	a	life	cycle	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 present 	 ations 	 	.
so	i	went	home	and	was	 hav 	 ing 	 	 d 	 inner 	 	with	my	wife	and	was	 tell 	 ing 	 	her	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	we	 we 	 re 	 	like	,	``	well	wait	a	second	.	if	we	know	that	 th 	 is 	 	technology	 exist 	 s 	 	where	you	can	use	your	 eye 	 s 	 	to	control	 thing 	 s 	 	,	why	do	n't	we	figure	out	a	way	for	tempt	to	control	a	laser	and	he	could	do	graf	 aga 	 in 	 	?	well	that	would	be	awesome	.	``	so	that	 start 	 ed 	 	the	journey	.
and	about	two	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	about	a	year	 lat 	 er 	 	,	after	a	bunch	of	 organ 	 ization 	 	and	a	bunch	of	moving	 thing 	 s 	 	around	,	we	'd	 accomplish 	 ed 	 	a	couple	 thing 	 s 	 	.
one	,	we	 batt 	 er 	 ed 	 	down	the	 door 	 s 	 	of	the	 insur 	 ance 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	,	and	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	got	tempt	a	machine	that	let	him	communicate	--	a	stephen	 hawk 	 ing 	 	machine	.
which	was	awesome	.
and	he	's	 serious 	 ly 	 	one	of	the	 funni 	 est 	 	--	i	call	him	yoda	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	talk	to	the	guy	,	you	get	an	email	from	him	,	and	you	're	like	,	``	i	'm	not	worthy	.	 th 	 is 	 	guy	's	so	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.	``	the	other	thing	we	did	is	we	flew	seven	 programm 	 ers 	 	from	all	over	the	world	--	 liter 	 ally 	 	every	corner	of	the	world	--	 in 	 to 	 	our	house	.
my	wife	and	 kid 	 s 	 	and	i	 move 	 d 	 	to	our	back	 gar 	 age 	 	,	and	these	 hack 	 ers 	 	and	 programm 	 ers 	 	and	 conspi 	 racy 	 	 theor 	 ists 	 	and	 anarch 	 ists 	 	took	over	our	house	.
a	lot	of	our	 friend 	 s 	 	thought	we	 we 	 re 	 	 absolute 	 ly 	 	stupid	to	do	that	and	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	come	back	and	all	the	 picture 	 s 	 	on	the	wall	would	be	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	and	graf	on	the	 wall 	 s 	 	.
but	for	over	two	 week 	 s 	 	,	we	 programm 	 ed 	 	,	we	went	to	the	venice	 board 	 walk 	 	,	my	 kid 	 s 	 	got	 involve 	 d 	 	,	my	dog	got	 involve 	 d 	 	,	and	we	 create 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	eyewriter	,	and	you	can	see	the	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	cheap	pair	of	 s 	 un 	 glass 	 es 	 	that	we	 b 	 ought 	 	at	the	venice	beach	 board 	 walk 	 	,	some	 cop 	 per 	 	wire	and	some	stuff	from	home	 de 	 pot 	 	and	radio	 s 	 hack 	 	.
we	took	a	ps	3	camera	,	 hack 	 ed 	 	it	open	,	 mount 	 ed 	 	it	to	an	led	light	,	and	now	there	's	a	 de 	 vice 	 	that	is	free	--	you	build	 th 	 is 	 	 your 	 self 	 	,	we	publish	the	code	for	free	,	you	download	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	for	free	.
and	now	we	've	 create 	 d 	 	a	 de 	 vice 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 absolute 	 ly 	 	no	 limit 	 ations 	 	.
there	's	no	 insur 	 ance 	 	company	that	can	say	``	no.	``
there	's	no	hospital	that	can	say	``	no.	``
 any 	 body 	 	who	's	 paralyze 	 d 	 	now	 ha 	 s 	 	access	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	draw	or	communicate	using	 on 	 ly 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	.
thank	you	.
thank	you	 guy 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.	that	was	awesome	.
so	at	the	end	of	the	two	 week 	 s 	 	,	we	went	back	to	tempt	's	room	.
i	love	 th 	 is 	 	picture	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 one 	 	else	's	room	and	that	's	his	room	.
so	there	's	all	 th 	 is 	 	hustle	and	_UNK_	going	on	for	the	big	 unveil 	 ing 	 	.
and	after	over	a	year	of	 plan 	 ning 	 	,	two	 week 	 s 	 	of	 programm 	 ing 	 	,	carb	-	fest	and	all	-	night	 session 	 s 	 	,	tony	drew	 aga 	 in 	 	for	the	first	time	in	seven	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	picture	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	his	life	support	system	,	and	he	's	looking	over	his	life	support	system	.
we	 kick 	 ed 	 	his	bed	so	that	he	could	see	out	.
and	we	set	up	a	 project 	 or 	 	on	a	wall	out	in	the	 park 	 ing 	 	lot	 out 	 side 	 	of	his	hospital	.
and	he	drew	 aga 	 in 	 	for	the	first	time	,	in	front	of	his	family	and	 friend 	 s 	 	--	and	you	can	 on 	 ly 	 	imagine	what	the	 feel 	 ing 	 	in	the	 park 	 ing 	 	lot	was	.
the	funny	thing	was	,	we	had	to	break	 in 	 to 	 	the	 park 	 ing 	 	lot	too	,	so	we	 total 	 ly 	 	felt	like	we	 we 	 re 	 	legit	in	the	whole	graf	scene	too	.
so	at	the	end	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	he	 s 	 ent 	 	us	an	email	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	the	email	 s 	 aid 	 	:	``	that	was	the	first	time	i	've	drawn	 any 	 thing 	 	for	seven	 year 	 s 	 	.
i	feel	like	i	had	 be 	 en 	 	held	 under 	 water 	 	,	and	 some 	 one 	 	 final 	 ly 	 	 reach 	 ed 	 	down	and	 pull 	 ed 	 	my	head	up	so	i	could	breathe	.	``	is	n't	that	awesome	?
so	that	's	kind	of	our	battle	cry	.
that	's	what	 keep 	 s 	 	us	going	and	 keep 	 s 	 	us	 develop 	 ing 	 	.
and	we	've	got	 s 	 uch 	 	a	long	way	to	go	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	,	but	it	's	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	an	etch	a	sketch	.
and	 some 	 one 	 	who	 ha 	 s 	 	that	kind	of	 art 	 istic 	 	potential	 deserve 	 s 	 	so	much	more	.
so	we	're	in	the	process	of	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	how	to	make	it	better	,	 fast 	 er 	 	,	 strong 	 er 	 	.
since	that	time	,	we	've	had	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 acknowledg 	 ment 	 	.
we	've	won	a	bunch	of	 a 	 ward 	 s 	 	.
remember	,	it	's	free	;	 non 	 e 	 	of	us	are	making	any	money	on	 th 	 is 	 	thing	.
it	's	all	coming	out	of	our	own	 pocket 	 s 	 	.
so	the	 a 	 ward 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	like	,	``	oh	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	fantastic	.	``	armstrong	twittered	about	us	,	and	then	in	december	,	time	magazine	 honor 	 ed 	 	us	 a 	 s 	 	one	of	the	top	50	 invent 	 ions 	 	of	2010	,	which	was	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	.
the	 cool 	 est 	 	thing	about	 th 	 is 	 	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	's	 comple 	 ting 	 	the	whole	circle	--	is	that	in	april	of	 th 	 is 	 	year	,	at	the	_UNK_	moca	in	 down 	 town 	 	los	angeles	,	there	's	going	to	be	an	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	``	art	of	the	 street 	 s 	 	.	``	and	``	art	of	the	 street 	 s 	 	``	is	going	to	have	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	the	bad	-	 ass 	 es 	 	of	the	street	art	scene	--	_UNK_	,	shepard	_UNK_	,	_UNK_	--	all	of	these	 guy 	 s 	 	will	be	there	.
tempt	's	going	to	be	in	the	show	,	which	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	awesome	.
so	 bas 	 ically 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	point	:	if	you	see	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	not	possible	,	make	it	possible	.
 every 	 thing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	was	n't	possible	--	 th 	 is 	 	stage	,	 th 	 is 	 	computer	,	 th 	 is 	 	mic	,	the	eyewriter	--	was	n't	possible	at	one	point	.
make	it	possible	,	 every 	 one 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	.
i	'm	not	a	 programm 	 er 	 	,	never	 d 	 one 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	with	ocular	 re 	 cognition 	 	technology	,	but	i	just	 recogn 	 ized 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	and	 associate 	 d 	 	 my 	 self 	 	with	 amaz 	 ing 	 	people	so	that	we	could	make	 some 	 thing 	 	happen	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	question	i	want	 every 	 one 	 	to	ask	 your 	 self 	 	every	single	day	when	you	come	up	with	 some 	 thing 	 	you	feel	that	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 d 	 one 	 	:
if	not	now	,	then	when	?	and	if	not	me	,	then	who	?
thank	you	 guy 	 s 	 	.
