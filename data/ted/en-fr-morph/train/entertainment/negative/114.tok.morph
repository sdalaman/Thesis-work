i	just	want	to	say	,	over	the	last	few	 year 	 s 	 	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	--	had	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	 clo 	 s 	 ing 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	.
and	i	've	had	some	 in 	 credible 	 	warm	-	up	 act 	 s 	 	.
about	eight	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	billy	graham	 open 	 ed 	 	for	me	.	and	i	thought	that	there	was	--	i	thought	that	there	was	 absolute 	 ly 	 	no	way	in	hell	to	top	that	.
but	i	just	 want 	 ed 	 	to	say	--	and	i	mean	 th 	 is 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 iron 	 y 	 	--	i	think	i	can	speak	for	 every 	 body 	 	in	the	audience	when	i	say	that	i	wish	to	god	that	you	 we 	 re 	 	the	 p 	 resident 	 	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
ok	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	title	of	my	talk	 to 	 day 	 	.
i	just	want	to	give	you	a	quick	 over 	 view 	 	.
first	of	all	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	remember	i	'm	 complete 	 ly 	 	 politic 	 ally 	 	correct	,	and	i	mean	 every 	 thing 	 	with	great	 affect 	 ion 	 	.
if	any	of	you	have	sensitive	 stomach 	 s 	 	or	are	 feel 	 ing 	 	queasy	,	now	is	the	time	to	check	your	 black 	 berry 	 	.
just	to	review	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	tedtalk	.
we	're	going	to	do	some	 joke 	 s 	 	,	some	gags	,	some	little	skits	--	and	then	we	're	going	to	talk	about	the	l	1	point	.
so	,	one	of	the	 question 	 s 	 	i	ask	 my 	 self 	 	is	,	was	 th 	 is 	 	the	most	 di 	 stress 	 ing 	 	ted	ever	?
let	's	try	and	sum	 thing 	 s 	 	up	,	 s 	 hall 	 	we	?
 image 	 s 	 	of	limb	 re 	 generation 	 	and	 face 	 s 	 	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	 small 	 pox 	 	:	21	percent	of	the	 con 	 ference 	 	.
 ment 	 ions 	 	of	polar	 bear 	 s 	 	 drown 	 ing 	 	:	four	percent	.
 image 	 s 	 	of	the	earth	 be 	 ing 	 	 wipe 	 d 	 	out	by	flood	or	bird	flu	:	64	percent	.
and	david	pogue	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	show	 tune 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	most	 di 	 stress 	 ing 	 	ted	ever	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	with	neil	gershenfeld	on	next	year	's	ted	bag	.
and	if	the	--	if	the	 con 	 ference 	 	is	 any 	 where 	 	near	 th 	 is 	 	 di 	 stress 	 ing 	 	,	then	we	're	going	to	have	a	 s 	 cream 	 	bag	next	year	.
it	's	going	to	be	a	cradle	-	to	-	cradle	 s 	 cream 	 	bag	,	of	course	.
so	you	're	going	to	be	able	to	go	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 br 	 ing 	 	it	over	here	and	open	it	up	.	aaaah	!
 mean 	 while 	 	,	back	at	ted	university	,	 th 	 is 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	woman	is	 teach 	 ing 	 	you	how	to	chop	 s 	 un 	 	 chip 	 s 	 	.
so	robert	wright	--	i	do	n't	know	,	i	felt	like	if	there	was	 any 	 one 	 	that	helen	 need 	 ed 	 	to	give	 anti 	 depress 	 ants 	 	to	,	it	might	have	 be 	 en 	 	him	.
i	want	to	 de 	 liberate 	 ly 	 	interfere	with	his	dopamine	 level 	 s 	 	.
he	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 moral 	 ity 	 	.
 eco 	 nomy 	 	class	 moral 	 ity 	 	is	,	we	want	to	bomb	you	back	to	the	stone	age	.
business	class	 moral 	 ity 	 	is	,	do	n't	bomb	japan	--	they	built	my	car	.
and	first	-	class	 moral 	 ity 	 	is	,	do	n't	bomb	mexico	--	they	clean	my	house	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	it	is	 politic 	 ally 	 	 in 	 correct 	 	.
all	right	,
now	i	want	to	do	a	little	bit	of	a	thing	for	you	...
all	right	,	now	these	are	the	wha	--	i	'd	say	,	[	mumble	,	mumble	--	mumble	,	mumble	,	mumble	,	mumble	,	mumble	]	--	ahh	!
so	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	show	you	 guy 	 s 	 	--	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	talk	about	a	 revolution 	 ary 	 	new	computer	 inter 	 face 	 	that	lets	you	work	with	 image 	 s 	 	just	 a 	 s 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	--	 a 	 s 	 	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	natural	user	 inter 	 face 	 	.
and	you	can	--	you	can	use	 re 	 ally 	 	natural	hand	 gest 	 ures 	 	to	like	,	go	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
now	we	had	a	harvard	professor	here	--	she	was	from	harvard	,	i	just	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 ment 	 ion 	 	and	--	and	she	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	professor	from	harvard	.
and	she	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	seven	-	dimensional	,	 in 	 vert 	 ed 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 s 	 	.
with	,	you	know	,	of	course	,	there	's	the	 gravit 	 y 	 	brain	.	there	's	the	weak	brain	.	and	then	there	's	my	weak	brain	,	which	is	too	--	too	--	 absolute 	 ly 	 	too	weak	to	understand	what	the	fuck	she	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	.
now	--
one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	me	is	to	try	and	figure	out	what	on	earth	am	i	here	for	.
and	that	's	why	i	went	out	and	i	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	a	best	-	selling	business	book	.
you	know	,	it	 bas 	 ically 	 	uses	 a 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	central	 pre 	 mise 	 	greek	 mytho 	 logy 	 	.
and	it	's	by	a	guy	named	pastor	rick	warren	,	and	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	porpoise	driven	life	.	``
and	rick	is	 a 	 s 	 	a	pagan	god	,	which	i	thought	was	kind	of	appropriate	,	in	a	certain	way	.
and	now	we	're	going	to	have	kind	of	a	little	more	 visual 	 ization 	 	about	rick	warren	.
ok	.	all	right	.
now	,	red	is	rick	warren	,	and	green	is	daniel	dennett	,	ok	?
the	 scale 	 s 	 	here	are	 relig 	 io 	 s 	 ity 	 	from	zero	percent	,	or	atheist	,	to	100	percent	,	 b 	 ible 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	true	.
and	then	 th 	 is 	 	is	 book 	 s 	 	 s 	 old 	 	--	the	 log 	 arithmic 	 	scale	.
30,000	,	300,000	,	three	million	,	30	million	,	300	million	.
ok	,	now	they	're	duking	it	out	.	now	they	're	duking	it	out	.
and	rick	warren	's	kind	of	 pull 	 ing 	 	 a 	 head 	 	,	kind	of	 pull 	 ing 	 	 a 	 head 	 	.
 y 	 up 	 	,	and	his	 install 	 ed 	 	base	is	 get 	 ting 	 	a	little	 big 	 ger 	 	.
but	darwin	's	 danger 	 ous 	 	idea	is	coming	back	.	it	's	coming	back	.
let	me	turn	the	 trail 	 s 	 	on	,	so	you	can	see	that	a	little	bit	better	.
now	,	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	is	,	nicholas	negroponte	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	us	about	one	lap	dance	per	--	i	'm	sorry	--	about	one	 lap 	 top 	 	per	child	.
now	let	's	talk	about	some	of	the	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	that	are	 import 	 ant 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	 revolution 	 ary 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	.
i	'll	tell	you	a	little	bit	about	the	design	 parameter 	 s 	 	,	and	then	i	'll	show	it	to	you	in	person	.
first	of	all	,	it	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	small	.
it	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	flat	,	so	it	's	transportable	.
 light 	 weight 	 	.	 port 	 able 	 	.
uses	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	little	power	.

and	 broad 	 ly 	 	 appli 	 cable 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 platform 	 s 	 	.
now	,	we	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	 d 	 one 	 	some	research	--	neil	gershenfeld	and	the	fab	 lab 	 s 	 	went	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	market	.
they	did	some	research	;	we	came	back	;	and	we	think	we	have	the	perfect	prototype	of	what	the	 student 	 s 	 	in	the	field	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	for	.
and	here	it	is	,	the	$	100	computer	.
ok	,	ok	,	ok	,	ok	--	 excel 	 lent 	 	,	 excel 	 lent 	 	.
now	,	i	 b 	 ought 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	from	clifford	stoll	for	about	900	 buck 	 s 	 	.
and	he	and	his	team	of	 juni 	 or 	 	-	high	school	 student 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	real	science	.
so	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	check	and	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 do 	 use 	 	here	,	and	see	who	uses	 mar 	 ijuana 	 	.
see	who	uses	 mar 	 ijuana 	 	.
are	we	going	to	be	able	to	find	any	 mar 	 ijuana 	 	,	jim	young	?
 on 	 ly 	 	if	we	open	 en 	 ough 	 	 lock 	 er 	 	 door 	 s 	 	.
ok	,	now	 small 	 pox 	 	is	an	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 di 	 stress 	 ing 	 	 ill 	 ness 	 	.
we	had	dr.	larry	 brilli 	 ant 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	how	we	 eradic 	 ated 	 	 small 	 pox 	 	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	show	you	the	 stage 	 s 	 	of	 small 	 pox 	 	.
we	start	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	day	one	.
day	two	.
day	three	,	she	 get 	 s 	 	a	 massive 	 ly 	 	big	pox	on	her	shoulder	.
day	three	.
day	four	.	day	five	and	day	six	.
now	the	good	news	is	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	a	trained	medical	professional	,	i	know	that	even	 th 	 ough 	 	she	'll	be	 scar 	 red 	 	for	life	,	she	's	going	to	make	a	full	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	.
now	the	good	news	about	 architect 	 s 	 	for	 human 	 ity 	 	is	they	're	 re 	 ally 	 	kind	of	the	most	 amaz 	 ing 	 	group	.
they	've	 be 	 en 	 	 sponsor 	 ing 	 	a	design	 com 	 petition 	 	to	come	up	with	 innov 	 ative 	 	medical	housing	 solution 	 s 	 	,	clinic	 solution 	 s 	 	,	in	africa	,	and	they	've	had	a	design	 com 	 petition 	 	.
now	the	 wonder 	 ful 	 	thing	is	,	larry	 brilli 	 ant 	 	was	just	 ap 	 point 	 ed 	 	the	head	of	the	google	 found 	 ation 	 	,
and	so	he	 decide 	 d 	 	that	he	would	support	--	he	would	support	cameron	's	work	.
and	the	way	he	 decide 	 d 	 	to	support	that	work	was	by	 ship 	 ping 	 	over	50,000	 ship 	 ping 	 	 contain 	 ers 	 	of	google	 snack 	 s 	 	.
so	i	want	to	show	you	some	 prototype 	 s 	 	.
the	u.n.	--	you	know	,	they	took	20	 year 	 s 	 	just	to	add	a	flap	to	a	tent	,
but	i	think	we	have	some	more	 excit 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	home	made	 entire 	 ly 	 	out	of	fruit	roll	-	 up 	 s 	 	.	and	 t 	 hose 	 	roll	-	up	 cookie 	 s 	 	 co 	 ated 	 	with	white	chocolate	.
and	the	 re 	 ally 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	thing	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	when	you	're	 d 	 one 	 	,	well	--	you	can	eat	it	.
but	the	thing	that	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	is	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	granola	house	.
and	the	granola	house	 ha 	 s 	 	a	special	 s 	 un 	 	chip	roof	to	collect	water	and	 re 	 cycle 	 	it	.
and	it	's	--	well	,	on	 th 	 is 	 	side	it	 ha 	 s 	 	regular	 s 	 our 	 	patch	 kid 	 s 	 	and	gummy	 bear 	 s 	 	to	let	in	the	light	.
but	on	 th 	 is 	 	side	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 sugar 	 y 	 	gummy	 bear 	 s 	 	,	to	diffuse	the	light	more	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	.
and	we	--	we	 want 	 ed 	 	just	to	show	you	what	 th 	 is 	 	might	look	like	in	situ	.
so	,	einstein	--	einstein	,	tell	me	--	what	's	your	 favor 	 ite 	 	song	?
no	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	what	's	your	 favor 	 ite 	 	song	?
no	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	what	's	your	 favor 	 ite 	 	song	?
``	free	bird	.	``
ok	,	so	,	einstein	,	what	's	your	 favor 	 ite 	 	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	group	?
could	you	say	that	 aga 	 in 	 	?	what	's	your	 favor 	 ite 	 	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	group	?

your	 favor 	 ite 	 	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	group	--	it	's	diana	ross	and	the	--	audience	:	supremes	!
tom	reilly	:	 exact 	 ly 	 	.
could	we	have	the	sound	up	on	the	 lap 	 top 	 	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	?
``	free	bird	``	kind	of	 re 	 mind 	 s 	 	me	that	if	you	--	if	you	listen	to	``	free	bird	``	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	you	might	hear	.
computer	:	satan	.	satan	.	satan	.	satan	.
satan	.	satan	.	satan	.
tr	:	now	it	's	a	little	hard	to	hear	the	whole	 mess 	 age 	 	,	so	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	--	so	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	help	you	a	little	bit	.

buy	``	the	purpose	-	driven	life	,	``	or	satan	will	take	your	soul	.
tr	:	so	,	we	've	 talk 	 ed 	 	a	lot	about	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	,	but	,	you	know	,	 a 	 s 	 	jill	 s 	 aid 	 	,	it	 sound 	 s 	 	kind	of	nice	--	good	weather	in	the	 winter 	 time 	 	,	and	new	york	city	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	jay	 walk 	 er 	 	 point 	 ed 	 	out	,	that	is	just	not	 scar 	 y 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	.
so	al	,	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	think	i	'm	 ra 	 ther 	 	good	at	 brand 	 ing 	 	.
so	i	've	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	figure	out	a	good	design	process	to	come	up	with	a	new	term	to	replace	``	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	.	``
so	we	 start 	 ed 	 	with	babel	fish	.	we	put	in	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	.
and	then	we	 decide 	 d 	 	that	we	'd	change	it	from	english	to	dutch	--	 in 	 to 	 	``	het	globale	verwarmen	.	``
from	dutch	to	chinese	,	 in 	 to 	 	``	hordahordaneecheewa	.	``
chinese	to	portuguese	:	aquecer	-	 s 	 e 	 	global	.
then	portuguese	to	pig	latin	.
aquecer	-	 s 	 e 	 	ucked	-	fay	.
and	then	 final 	 ly 	 	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	english	,	which	is	,	we	're	 total 	 ly 	 	 fuck 	 ed 	 	.
now	i	do	n't	know	about	you	,	but	michael	shermer	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	the	 will 	 ing 	 ness 	 	for	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	--	 evolution 	 arily 	 	,	they	're	designed	to	see	 pattern 	 s 	 	in	 thing 	 s 	 	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	in	cheese	 sandwich 	 es 	 	.
now	can	you	look	at	that	 care 	 fully 	 	and	see	if	you	see	the	virgin	mary	?
i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	make	it	a	little	bit	 clear 	 er 	 	.
is	it	the	virgin	mary	?
or	is	it	mena	trott	?
so	,	i	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	josh	prince	-	ramus	about	the	convention	center	and	the	 con 	 ference 	 s 	 	.	it	's	 get 	 ting 	 	 awful 	 ly 	 	big	.
it	's	 get 	 ting 	 	just	a	little	bit	too	big	.	it	's	 burst 	 ing 	 	at	the	 seam 	 s 	 	here	a	little	bit	.
so	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	come	up	with	a	program	--	how	we	could	 re 	 make 	 	 th 	 is 	 	structure	to	better	 accommo 	 date 	 	ted	.
so	first	of	all	we	 decide 	 d 	 	--	that	we	 need 	 ed 	 	about	one	-	third	 book 	 store 	 	,	one	-	third	google	cafe	,	about	20	percent	 registr 	 ation 	 	,	80	percent	 luxur 	 y 	 	hotel	,	about	five	percent	for	restrooms	.
and	then	of	course	,	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	have	the	 simul 	 cast 	 	 loung 	 e 	 	,	the	lobby	and	the	steinbeck	forum	.
now	let	me	show	you	how	that	 liter 	 ally 	 	 transl 	 ated 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	design	program	.
so	first	,	one	of	the	 problem 	 s 	 	with	monterey	is	that	if	there	is	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	and	greenland	 melt 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	say	,	the	ocean	level	is	going	to	rise	20	feet	and	flood	the	hell	out	of	the	convention	center	.
so	we	're	going	to	build	 th 	 is 	 	new	building	on	 s 	 tilt 	 s 	 	.
so	we	build	 th 	 is 	 	building	on	 s 	 tilt 	 s 	 	,	then	up	here	--	is	where	we	're	going	to	put	the	new	steinbeck	 audit 	 orium 	 	.
and	the	 wonder 	 ful 	 	thing	about	the	new	 book 	 store 	 	is	,	it	's	going	to	be	shaped	in	a	spiral	that	's	 organize 	 d 	 	by	the	dewey	decimal	system	.
then	we	're	going	to	make	an	 escal 	 ator 	 	that	 help 	 s 	 	you	get	up	there	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	we	're	going	to	put	the	marriott	hotel	and	the	portola	plaza	on	the	top	.
now	i	do	n't	know	about	you	,	but	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	i	have	these	 image 	 s 	 	in	my	head	of	 separat 	 ed 	 	at	birth	.
i	do	n't	know	about	you	,	but	when	i	see	aubrey	de	 gr 	 ey 	 	,	i	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	go	to	gandalf	the	 gr 	 ey 	 	.
ok	.	now	,	we	've	heard	,	of	course	,	that	we	're	all	 soldier 	 s 	 	here	.
so	what	i	'd	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	like	you	to	do	now	is	,	pick	up	your	white	piece	of	paper	.	 do 	 es 	 	 every 	 body 	 	have	 the 	 ir 	 	white	piece	of	paper	?
and	i	want	you	to	get	out	a	pen	,	and	i	want	you	to	write	a	terrorist	note	.
if	we	put	up	the	elmo	for	a	moment	--	if	we	put	up	the	elmo	,	then	we	'll	get	,	you	know	,	i	'll	give	you	a	model	that	you	can	work	from	,	ok	?
and	then	i	want	you	to	fold	that	note	 in 	 to 	 	a	paper	 air 	 plane 	 	.
and	once	you	've	 fold 	 ed 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	paper	 air 	 plane 	 	,	i	want	you	to	take	some	 an 	 thra 	 x 	 	--	and	i	want	you	to	put	that	in	the	paper	 air 	 plane 	 	.
and	then	i	want	you	to	throw	it	on	jim	young	.
 luck 	 ily 	 	,	i	was	the	recipient	of	the	ted	prize	 th 	 is 	 	year	.
and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	see	--	i	want	to	dedicate	 th 	 is 	 	film	to	my	father	,	homer	.
ok	.	now	 th 	 is 	 	film	is	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	 en 	 ough 	 	,
so	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	make	it	a	little	bit	 hard 	 er 	 	.
so	i	'm	going	to	try	and	do	 th 	 is 	 	while	 re 	 cit 	 ing 	 	pi	.

can	we	cue	the	music	 pleas 	 e 	 	?
now	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	use	 th 	 is 	 	talk	to	talk	about	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	a	little	bit	.
back	in	1968	,	you	can	see	that	the	mountain	range	of	brokeback	mountain	was	 cover 	 ed 	 	in	151	 inch 	 es 	 	of	snow	pack	.
 parent 	 hetic 	 ally 	 	,	over	there	on	the	 slop 	 es 	 	,	i	did	want	to	show	you	that	black	men	ski	.
but	over	the	 year 	 s 	 	,	10	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	the	snow	 pack 	 s 	 	 erode 	 d 	 	,	and	,	if	you	notice	,	the	 tree 	 s 	 	have	 start 	 ed 	 	 turn 	 ing 	 	yellow	.
the	water	level	of	the	lake	 ha 	 s 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	 dry 	 ing 	 	up	.
a	few	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	there	's	no	snow	left	at	all	.
and	all	the	 tree 	 s 	 	have	 turn 	 ed 	 	 brow 	 n 	 	.

and	i	fear	,	if	we	do	 noth 	 ing 	 	for	our	planet	,	in	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	it	's	going	to	look	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
mr.	vice	 p 	 resident 	 	,	i	wish	i	 k 	 new 	 	how	to	quit	you	.
