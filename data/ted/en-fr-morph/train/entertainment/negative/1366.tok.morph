my	story	 begin 	 s 	 	right	here	 actual 	 ly 	 	in	rajasthan	about	two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
i	was	in	the	desert	,	under	the	 star 	 ry 	 	 ski 	 es 	 	with	the	sufi	 s 	 ing 	 er 	 	_UNK_	ali	.
and	we	 we 	 re 	 	in	conversation	about	how	 noth 	 ing 	 	had	 change 	 d 	 	since	the	time	of	the	ancient	indian	epic	``	the	mahabharata	.	``
so	back	in	the	day	,	when	us	 in 	 d 	 ians 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	travel	we	'd	jump	 in 	 to 	 	a	 cha 	 riot 	 	and	we	'd	zoom	 a 	 cross 	 	the	sky	.
now	we	do	the	same	with	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	.
back	then	,	when	_UNK_	,	the	great	indian	warrior	prince	,	when	he	was	 thirst 	 y 	 	,	he	'd	take	out	a	bow	,	he	'd	shoot	it	 in 	 to 	 	the	ground	and	water	would	come	out	.
now	we	do	the	same	with	 drill 	 s 	 	and	 machine 	 s 	 	.
the	 con 	 clusion 	 	that	we	came	to	was	that	magic	had	 be 	 en 	 	 replace 	 d 	 	by	 machine 	 ry 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	made	me	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 ad 	 	.
i	found	 my 	 self 	 	 be 	 coming 	 	a	little	bit	of	a	_UNK_	.
i	was	 terr 	 ified 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	idea	that	i	would	lose	the	ability	to	enjoy	and	appreciate	the	 s 	 un 	 set 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	my	camera	on	me	,	 with 	 out 	 	 tweet 	 ing 	 	it	to	my	 friend 	 s 	 	.
and	it	felt	like	technology	should	 en 	 able 	 	magic	,	not	kill	it	.
when	i	was	a	little	girl	,	my	 grand 	 father 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	me	his	little	silver	pocket	watch	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	piece	of	50	-	year	-	old	technology	 be 	 came 	 	the	most	 magic 	 al 	 	thing	to	me	.
it	 be 	 came 	 	a	 gi 	 ld 	 ed 	 	 gate 	 way 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	world	full	of	 pirate 	 s 	 	and	shipwrecks	and	 image 	 s 	 	in	my	 imagin 	 ation 	 	.
so	i	felt	like	our	 cell 	 phone 	 s 	 	and	our	 f 	 ancy 	 	 watch 	 es 	 	and	our	 camera 	 s 	 	had	 stop 	 ped 	 	us	from	 dream 	 ing 	 	.
they	 stop 	 ped 	 	us	from	 be 	 ing 	 	inspired	.
and	so	i	 jump 	 ed 	 	in	,	i	 jump 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	world	of	technology	,	to	see	how	i	could	use	it	to	 en 	 able 	 	magic	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	kill	it	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 illustr 	 ating 	 	 book 	 s 	 	since	i	was	16	.
and	so	when	i	saw	the	ipad	,	i	saw	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	 story 	 tell 	 ing 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	that	could	connect	 read 	 ers 	 	all	over	the	world	.
it	can	know	how	we	're	 hold 	 ing 	 	it	.
it	can	know	where	we	are	.
it	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	together	image	and	text	and	 anim 	 ation 	 	and	sound	and	touch	.
 story 	 tell 	 ing 	 	is	 be 	 coming 	 	more	and	more	multi	-	 sensor 	 ial 	 	.
but	what	are	we	 do 	 ing 	 	with	it	?
so	i	'm	 actual 	 ly 	 	just	going	to	go	in	and	launch	khoya	,	an	 inter 	 active 	 	app	for	the	ipad	.
so	it	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	place	your	 finger 	 s 	 	 up 	 on 	 	each	light	.	``	and	so	--	it	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	box	 belong 	 s 	 	to	...	``	and	so	i	type	in	my	name	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	i	 be 	 come 	 	a	character	in	the	book	.
at	 vari 	 ous 	 	 point 	 s 	 	,	a	little	letter	 drop 	 s 	 	down	to	me	--	and	the	ipad	 know 	 s 	 	where	you	live	 be 	 cause 	 	of	gps	--	which	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 address 	 ed 	 	to	me	.
the	child	in	me	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	by	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 possibil 	 ities 	 	.
now	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	a	lot	about	magic	.
and	i	do	n't	mean	 wizard 	 s 	 	and	 dragon 	 s 	 	,	i	mean	the	kind	of	 child 	 hood 	 	magic	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	that	we	all	 harbor 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	children	.
 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	 fire 	 flies 	 	in	a	jar	,	for	some	reason	,	was	 al 	 ways 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	to	me	.
and	so	over	here	you	need	to	tilt	your	ipad	,	take	the	 fire 	 flies 	 	out	.
and	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	illuminate	your	way	through	the	rest	of	the	book	.
 an 	 other 	 	idea	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 fascinate 	 d 	 	me	 a 	 s 	 	a	child	was	that	an	entire	 galax 	 y 	 	could	be	 contain 	 ed 	 	 with 	 in 	 	a	single	 mar 	 ble 	 	.
and	so	over	here	,	each	book	and	each	world	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	little	 mar 	 ble 	 	that	i	drag	in	to	 th 	 is 	 	 magic 	 al 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	 de 	 vice 	 	.
and	it	 open 	 s 	 	up	a	map	.
all	 a 	 long 	 	,	all	 fanta 	 s 	 y 	 	 book 	 s 	 	have	 al 	 ways 	 	had	 map 	 s 	 	,	but	these	 map 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	static	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	map	that	 grow 	 s 	 	and	 glow 	 s 	 	and	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	your	 navig 	 ation 	 	for	the	rest	of	the	book	.
it	 reveal 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	to	you	at	certain	 point 	 s 	 	in	the	book	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
so	i	'm	just	going	to	enter	in	.
 an 	 other 	 	thing	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	me	is	creating	content	that	is	indian	and	yet	 ver 	 y 	 	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	.
over	here	,	these	are	the	apsaras	.
so	we	've	all	heard	about	 fair 	 ies 	 	and	we	've	all	heard	about	_UNK_	,	but	how	 man 	 y 	 	people	 out 	 side 	 	of	india	know	about	 the 	 ir 	 	indian	 counter 	 part 	 s 	 	,	the	apsaras	?
these	poor	apsaras	have	 be 	 en 	 	trapped	 in 	 side 	 	indra	's	 chamber 	 s 	 	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	in	an	old	and	_UNK_	book	.
and	so	we	're	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	them	back	in	a	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	story	for	children	.
and	a	story	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 deal 	 s 	 	with	new	 issue 	 s 	 	like	the	 environment 	 al 	 	crisis	.
 s 	 peaking 	 	of	the	 environment 	 al 	 	crisis	,	i	think	a	big	problem	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	in	the	last	10	 year 	 s 	 	is	that	children	have	 be 	 en 	 	 lock 	 ed 	 	 in 	 side 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	rooms	,	 glu 	 ed 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	pcs	,	they	have	n't	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	get	out	.
but	now	with	mobile	technology	,	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	take	our	children	 out 	 side 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	natural	world	with	 the 	 ir 	 	technology	.
one	of	the	 interact 	 ions 	 	in	the	book	is	that	you	're	 s 	 ent 	 	off	on	 th 	 is 	 	quest	where	you	need	to	go	 out 	 side 	 	,	take	out	your	camera	on	the	ipad	and	collect	 picture 	 s 	 	of	different	natural	 object 	 s 	 	.
when	i	was	a	child	,	i	had	 multi 	 ple 	 	 collect 	 ions 	 	of	 stick 	 s 	 	and	 stone 	 s 	 	and	 pe 	 bble 	 s 	 	and	 shell 	 s 	 	.
and	 some 	 how 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	do	n't	do	that	 any 	 more 	 	.
so	in	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	back	 th 	 is 	 	 child 	 hood 	 	ritual	,	you	need	to	go	out	and	,	in	one	chapter	,	take	a	picture	of	a	flower	and	then	tag	it	.
in	 an 	 other 	 	chapter	,	you	need	to	take	a	picture	of	a	piece	of	bark	and	then	tag	that	.
and	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	that	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	create	a	digital	 collect 	 ion 	 	of	 photograph 	 s 	 	that	you	can	then	put	up	 on 	 line 	 	.
a	child	in	london	 put 	 s 	 	up	a	picture	of	a	fox	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	oh	,	i	saw	a	fox	 to 	 day 	 	.	``	a	child	in	india	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	saw	a	monkey	 to 	 day 	 	.	``	and	it	 create 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	social	network	around	a	 collect 	 ion 	 	of	digital	 photograph 	 s 	 	that	you	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	taken	.
in	the	 possibil 	 ities 	 	of	 link 	 ing 	 	together	magic	,	the	earth	and	technology	,	there	are	 multi 	 ple 	 	 possibil 	 ities 	 	.
in	the	next	book	,	we	plan	on	 hav 	 ing 	 	an	 interact 	 ion 	 	where	you	take	your	ipad	out	with	the	video	on	and	through	 augment 	 ed 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	,	you	see	 th 	 is 	 	layer	of	 animate 	 d 	 	pixies	appear	on	a	_UNK_	that	's	 out 	 side 	 	your	house	.
at	one	point	,	your	screen	is	 fill 	 ed 	 	up	with	 leav 	 es 	 	.
and	so	you	need	to	make	the	sound	of	wind	and	blow	them	away	and	read	the	rest	of	the	book	.
we	're	moving	,	we	're	all	moving	here	,	to	a	world	where	the	 force 	 s 	 	of	nature	come	 close 	 r 	 	together	to	technology	,	and	magic	and	technology	can	come	 close 	 r 	 	together	.
we	're	 harness 	 ing 	 	energy	from	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
we	're	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	our	children	and	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 close 	 r 	 	to	the	natural	world	and	that	magic	and	joy	and	 child 	 hood 	 	love	that	we	had	through	the	simple	medium	of	a	story	.
thank	you	.
