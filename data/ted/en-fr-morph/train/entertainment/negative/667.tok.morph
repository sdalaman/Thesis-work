all	 building 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	have	 some 	 thing 	 	in	common	.
they	're	made	using	victorian	 techno 	 logies 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 involve 	 s 	 	 blue 	 print 	 s 	 	,	industrial	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	and	construction	using	 team 	 s 	 	of	 work 	 ers 	 	.
all	of	 th 	 is 	 	effort	 result 	 s 	 	in	an	 in 	 ert 	 	object	.
and	that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	there	is	a	one	-	way	transfer	of	energy	from	our	environment	 in 	 to 	 	our	 home 	 s 	 	and	cities	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 sustain 	 able 	 	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	that	it	is	possible	for	us	to	construct	 genuine 	 ly 	 	 sustain 	 able 	 	 home 	 s 	 	and	cities	is	by	 connect 	 ing 	 	them	to	nature	,	not	 insula 	 ting 	 	them	from	it	.
now	,	in	order	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	need	the	right	kind	of	language	.
living	 system 	 s 	 	are	in	constant	conversation	with	the	natural	world	,	through	 set 	 s 	 	of	chemical	 react 	 ions 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 metabol 	 ism 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 con 	 version 	 	of	one	group	of	 sub 	 stance 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 an 	 other 	 	,	either	through	the	production	or	the	absorption	of	energy	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	way	in	which	living	 material 	 s 	 	make	the	most	of	 the 	 ir 	 	local	 resource 	 s 	 	in	a	 sustain 	 able 	 	way	.
so	,	i	'm	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	use	of	 metabol 	 ic 	 	 material 	 s 	 	for	the	practice	of	 architect 	 ure 	 	.
but	they	do	n't	exist	.	so	i	'm	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	make	them	.
i	'm	 work 	 ing 	 	with	architect	neil	spiller	at	the	bartlett	school	of	 architect 	 ure 	 	,
and	we	're	 collabor 	 ating 	 	with	 inter 	 national 	 	 scientist 	 s 	 	in	order	to	generate	these	new	 material 	 s 	 	from	a	bottom	up	approach	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	we	're	generating	them	from	scratch	.
one	of	our	 collabor 	 ators 	 	is	chemist	martin	hanczyc	,
and	he	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	 transit 	 ion 	 	from	 in 	 ert 	 	to	living	matter	.
now	,	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	kind	of	process	that	i	'm	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	,	when	we	're	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 sustain 	 able 	 	 material 	 s 	 	.
so	,	martin	,	he	 work 	 s 	 	with	a	system	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 proto 	 cell 	 	.
now	all	 th 	 is 	 	is	--	and	it	's	magic	--	is	a	little	fatty	bag	.	and	it	's	got	a	chemical	 batt 	 ery 	 	in	it	.
and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	no	dna	.
 th 	 is 	 	little	bag	is	able	to	conduct	 it 	 self 	 	in	a	way	that	can	 on 	 ly 	 	be	 de 	 scribed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	living	.
it	is	able	to	move	around	 it 	 s 	 	environment	.
it	can	follow	chemical	 grad 	 ient 	 s 	 	.
it	can	 under 	 go 	 	complex	 react 	 ions 	 	,	some	of	which	are	 hap 	 pi 	 ly 	 	 architect 	 ural 	 	.
so	here	we	are	.	these	are	 proto 	 cell 	 s 	 	,	 pattern 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	environment	.
we	do	n't	know	how	they	do	that	yet	.
here	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 proto 	 cell 	 	,	and	it	's	 vigor 	 ously 	 	 shed 	 d 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	skin	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	chemical	kind	of	birth	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	violent	process	.
here	,	we	've	got	a	 proto 	 cell 	 	to	 ex 	 tract 	 	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	out	of	the	atmosphere	and	turn	it	 in 	 to 	 	 carbon 	 ate 	 	.
and	that	's	the	shell	around	that	 glob 	 ular 	 	fat	.
they	are	 quit 	 e 	 	brittle	.	so	you	've	 on 	 ly 	 	got	a	part	of	one	there	.
so	what	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	is	,	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	push	these	 techno 	 logies 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	creating	bottom	-	up	construction	 approach 	 es 	 	for	 architect 	 ure 	 	,	which	contrast	the	current	,	victorian	,	top	-	down	 method 	 s 	 	which	impose	structure	 up 	 on 	 	matter	.
that	ca	n't	be	 energ 	 et 	 ically 	 	 sens 	 ible 	 	.
so	,	bottom	-	up	 material 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	exist	 to 	 day 	 	.
they	've	 be 	 en 	 	in	use	,	in	 architect 	 ure 	 	,	since	ancient	 time 	 s 	 	.
if	you	walk	around	the	city	of	oxford	,	where	we	are	 to 	 day 	 	,	and	have	a	look	at	the	 brick 	 work 	 	,	which	i	've	 enjoy 	 ed 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	in	the	last	couple	of	 day 	 s 	 	,	you	'll	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	that	a	lot	of	it	is	made	of	 lime 	 stone 	 	.
and	if	you	look	even	 close 	 r 	 	,	you	'll	see	,	in	that	 lime 	 stone 	 	,	there	are	little	 shell 	 s 	 	and	little	 skeleton 	 s 	 	that	are	 pil 	 ed 	 	 up 	 on 	 	each	other	.
and	then	they	are	 fossil 	 ized 	 	over	 million 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
now	a	block	of	 lime 	 stone 	 	,	in	 it 	 self 	 	,	is	n't	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	that	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
it	 look 	 s 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
but	imagine	what	the	 proper 	 ties 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 lime 	 stone 	 	block	might	be	if	the	 surface 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	in	conversation	with	the	atmosphere	.
 may 	 be 	 	they	could	 ex 	 tract 	 	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	.
would	it	give	 th 	 is 	 	block	of	 lime 	 stone 	 	new	 proper 	 ties 	 	?
well	,	most	 like 	 ly 	 	it	would	.	it	might	be	able	to	grow	.
it	might	be	able	to	self	-	repair	,	and	even	respond	to	 dramat 	 ic 	 	 change 	 s 	 	in	the	 im 	 mediate 	 	environment	.
so	,	 architect 	 s 	 	are	never	happy	with	just	one	block	of	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	material	.
they	think	big	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
so	when	we	think	about	 scal 	 ing 	 	up	 metabol 	 ic 	 	 material 	 s 	 	,	we	can	start	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 eco 	 logical 	 	 intervention 	 s 	 	like	repair	of	 a 	 toll 	 s 	 	,	or	 re 	 clam 	 ation 	 	of	 part 	 s 	 	of	a	city	that	are	 damage 	 d 	 	by	water	.
so	,	one	of	these	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	would	of	course	be	the	historic	city	of	venice	.
now	,	venice	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	know	,	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 tempest 	 uous 	 	relationship	with	the	sea	,	and	is	built	 up 	 on 	 	 wood 	 en 	 	 pile 	 s 	 	.
so	we	've	 de 	 vis 	 ed 	 	a	way	by	which	it	may	be	possible	for	the	 proto 	 cell 	 	technology	that	we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	with	to	 sustain 	 ably 	 	 re 	 claim 	 	venice	.
and	architect	christian	kerrigan	 ha 	 s 	 	come	up	with	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 design 	 s 	 	that	show	us	how	it	may	be	possible	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	grow	a	 lime 	 stone 	 	reef	 under 	 neath 	 	the	city	.
so	,	here	is	the	technology	we	have	 to 	 day 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	our	 proto 	 cell 	 	technology	,	 effective 	 ly 	 	making	a	shell	,	like	 it 	 s 	 	 lime 	 stone 	 	 fore 	 father 	 s 	 	,	and	 deposit 	 ing 	 	it	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	complex	environment	,	against	natural	 material 	 s 	 	.
we	're	looking	at	crystal	 lattice 	 s 	 	to	see	the	 bond 	 ing 	 	process	in	 th 	 is 	 	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	part	.
we	do	n't	just	want	 lime 	 stone 	 	 dump 	 ed 	 	 every 	 where 	 	in	all	the	 pre 	 tty 	 	 can 	 al 	 s 	 	.
 creative 	 ly 	 	 craft 	 ed 	 	around	the	 wood 	 en 	 	 pile 	 s 	 	.
so	,	you	can	see	from	these	 dia 	 gram 	 s 	 	that	the	 proto 	 cell 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	moving	away	from	the	light	,	 to 	 ward 	 	the	dark	 found 	 ations 	 	.
we	've	 observ 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	 labor 	 atory 	 	.
the	 proto 	 cell 	 s 	 	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	move	away	from	the	light	.
they	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	 al 	 so 	 	move	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	light	.	you	have	to	just	 choos 	 e 	 	your	species	.
so	that	these	do	n't	just	exist	 a 	 s 	 	one	 ent 	 ity 	 	,	we	kind	of	 chemical 	 ly 	 	engineer	them	.
and	so	here	the	 proto 	 cell 	 s 	 	are	 deposit 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 lime 	 stone 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 specific 	 ally 	 	,	around	the	 found 	 ations 	 	of	venice	,	 effective 	 ly 	 	 petr 	 ifying 	 	it	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	going	to	happen	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	.	it	's	going	to	take	a	while	.
it	's	going	to	take	 year 	 s 	 	of	 t 	 un 	 ing 	 	and	 monitor 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	technology	in	order	for	us	to	 be 	 come 	 	ready	to	test	it	out	in	a	case	-	by	-	case	 bas 	 is 	 	on	the	most	 damage 	 d 	 	and	 stress 	 ed 	 	 building 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	city	of	venice	.
but	 gradu 	 ally 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	 building 	 s 	 	are	 repair 	 ed 	 	,	we	will	see	the	 ac 	 cre 	 tion 	 	of	a	 lime 	 stone 	 	reef	 be 	 neath 	 	the	city	.
an	 ac 	 cre 	 tion 	 	 it 	 self 	 	is	a	huge	sink	of	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	.
 al 	 so 	 	it	will	attract	the	local	marine	 eco 	 logy 	 	,	who	will	find	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 eco 	 logical 	 	 niche 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 architect 	 ure 	 	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.	now	we	have	an	 architect 	 ure 	 	that	 connect 	 s 	 	a	city	to	the	natural	world	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	direct	and	 im 	 mediate 	 	way	.
but	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	the	most	 excit 	 ing 	 	thing	about	it	is	that	the	driver	of	 th 	 is 	 	technology	is	 avail 	 able 	 	 every 	 where 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	terrestrial	 chemist 	 ry 	 	.	we	've	all	got	it	,
which	 mean 	 s 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	technology	is	just	 a 	 s 	 	appropriate	for	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	for	first	world	 count 	 ries 	 	.
so	,	in	 summ 	 ary 	 	,	i	'm	generating	 metabol 	 ic 	 	 material 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 counter 	 poise 	 	to	victorian	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	and	building	 architect 	 ures 	 	from	a	bottom	-	up	approach	.
 second 	 ly 	 	,	these	 metabol 	 ic 	 	 material 	 s 	 	have	some	of	the	 proper 	 ties 	 	of	living	 system 	 s 	 	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	they	can	perform	in	similar	ways	.
they	can	expect	to	have	a	lot	of	 form 	 s 	 	and	 function 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	practice	of	 architect 	 ure 	 	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	an	 observ 	 er 	 	in	the	future	 marvel 	 ing 	 	at	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	structure	in	the	environment	may	find	it	 al 	 most 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	to	tell	 whet 	 her 	 	 th 	 is 	 	structure	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 create 	 d 	 	by	a	natural	process	or	an	artificial	one	.
thank	you	.
