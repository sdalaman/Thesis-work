i	'm	often	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	what	 surprise 	 s 	 	you	about	the	book	?
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	that	i	got	to	write	it	.
i	would	have	never	 imagin 	 ed 	 	that	,	not	in	my	 wild 	 est 	 	 dream 	 s 	 	did	i	think	--	i	do	n't	even	consider	 my 	 self 	 	to	be	an	author	.
and	i	'm	often	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	why	do	you	think	so	 man 	 y 	 	people	have	read	 th 	 is 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	thing	's	selling	still	about	a	million	copies	a	month	.
and	i	think	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	spiritual	 empti 	 ness 	 	is	a	universal	disease	.
i	think	 in 	 side 	 	at	some	point	,	we	put	our	 head 	 s 	 	down	on	the	 pil 	 low 	 	and	we	go	,	``	there	's	got	to	be	more	to	life	than	 th 	 is 	 	.	``
get	up	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	go	to	work	,	come	home	and	watch	tv	,	go	to	bed	,	get	up	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	go	to	work	,	come	home	,	watch	tv	,	go	to	bed	,	go	to	 part 	 ies 	 	on	 week 	 end 	 s 	 	.
a	lot	of	people	say	,	``	i	'm	living	.	``	no	,	you	're	not	living	--	that	's	just	 exist 	 ing 	 	.
just	 exist 	 ing 	 	.
i	 re 	 ally 	 	think	that	's	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	inner	 desir 	 e 	 	.
i	do	 believ 	 e 	 	what	chris	 s 	 aid 	 	.	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	you	're	not	an	accident	.
your	 parent 	 s 	 	may	not	have	 plan 	 ned 	 	you	,	but	i	 believ 	 e 	 	god	did	.
i	think	there	are	 accident 	 al 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	;	there	's	no	doubt	about	that	.
i	do	n't	think	there	are	 accident 	 al 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	.
and	i	think	you	matter	.
i	think	you	matter	to	god	;	i	think	you	matter	to	 histo 	 ry 	 	;	i	think	you	matter	to	 th 	 is 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
and	i	think	that	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	what	i	call	the	 surviv 	 al 	 	level	of	living	,	the	success	level	of	living	and	the	significant	level	of	living	is	,	do	you	figure	out	,	what	on	earth	am	i	here	for	?
i	meet	a	lot	of	people	who	are	 ver 	 y 	 	smart	,	and	say	,	``	but	why	ca	n't	i	figure	out	my	 problem 	 s 	 	?	``
and	i	meet	a	lot	of	people	who	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	,	who	say	,	``	why	do	n't	i	feel	more	 fulfill 	 ed 	 	?
why	do	i	feel	like	a	fake	?
why	do	i	feel	like	i	've	got	to	pretend	that	i	'm	more	than	i	 re 	 ally 	 	am	?	``
i	think	that	 come 	 s 	 	down	to	 th 	 is 	 	issue	of	meaning	,	of	 sign 	 ific 	 ance 	 	,	of	purpose	.
i	think	it	 come 	 s 	 	down	to	 th 	 is 	 	issue	of	:	why	am	i	here	?	what	am	i	here	for	?	where	am	i	going	?
these	are	not	religious	 issue 	 s 	 	--	they	're	human	 issue 	 s 	 	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	tell	michael	before	he	spoke	that	i	 re 	 ally 	 	appreciate	what	he	 do 	 es 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 make 	 s 	 	my	life	work	a	whole	lot	 eas 	 ier 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	pastor	,	i	do	see	a	lot	of	 kook 	 s 	 	.
and	i	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	there	are	 kook 	 s 	 	in	every	area	of	life	.
 relig 	 ion 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	a	 monopol 	 y 	 	on	that	,	but	there	are	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	religious	 kook 	 s 	 	.
there	are	secular	 kook 	 s 	 	;	there	are	smart	 kook 	 s 	 	,	dumb	 kook 	 s 	 	.
there	are	people	--	a	 lad 	 y 	 	came	up	to	me	the	other	day	,	and	she	had	a	white	piece	of	paper	--	michael	,	you	'll	like	 th 	 is 	 	one	--	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	do	you	see	in	it	?	``
and	i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	it	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	oh	,	i	do	n't	see	 any 	 thing 	 	.	``
and	she	 go 	 es 	 	,	``	well	,	i	see	jesus	,	``	and	 start 	 ed 	 	 cry 	 ing 	 	and	left	.
i	'm	going	,	ok	,	you	know	.	fine	.
um	.
when	the	book	 be 	 came 	 	the	best	-	selling	book	in	the	world	for	the	last	three	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	kind	of	had	my	little	crisis	.
and	that	was	:	what	is	the	purpose	of	 th 	 is 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	it	 br 	 ought 	 	in	enormous	 amount 	 s 	 	of	money	.
when	you	write	the	best	-	selling	book	in	the	world	,	it	's	 ton 	 s 	 	and	 ton 	 s 	 	of	money	--
and	it	 br 	 ought 	 	in	a	lot	of	attention	,	 n 	 either 	 	of	which	i	 want 	 ed 	 	.
when	i	 start 	 ed 	 	saddleback	church	,	i	was	25	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	it	with	one	other	family	in	1980	.
and	i	 decide 	 d 	 	that	i	was	never	going	to	go	on	tv	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	did	n't	want	to	be	a	 celebr 	 ity 	 	,	i	did	n't	want	to	be	a	,	quote	,	``	 evangel 	 ist 	 	,	 tel 	 evangel 	 ist 	 	``	--	that	's	not	my	thing	.
and	all	of	a	sudden	,	it	 br 	 ought 	 	a	lot	of	money	and	a	lot	of	attention	.
i	do	n't	think	--	now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 world 	 view 	 	,	and	i	will	tell	you	,	 every 	 body 	 	's	got	a	 world 	 view 	 	.
 every 	 body 	 	's	 bet 	 ting 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	life	on	 some 	 thing 	 	.
you	're	 bet 	 ting 	 	your	life	on	 some 	 thing 	 	--	you	just	better	know	why	you	're	 bet 	 ting 	 	what	you	're	 bet 	 ting 	 	on	.
so	,	 every 	 body 	 	's	 bet 	 ting 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	life	on	 some 	 thing 	 	,	and	when	i	,	you	know	,	made	a	bet	,	i	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	jesus	was	who	he	 s 	 aid 	 	he	was	.
but	 every 	 body 	 	's	got	--	and	i	 believ 	 e 	 	in	a	 plural 	 istic 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	--	 every 	 body 	 	's	 bet 	 ting 	 	on	 some 	 thing 	 	.
and	when	i	 start 	 ed 	 	the	church	,	you	know	,	i	had	no	 plan 	 s 	 	to	do	what	it	's	 do 	 ing 	 	now	.
and	then	when	i	wrote	 th 	 is 	 	book	,	and	all	of	a	sudden	it	just	took	off	,	then	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	now	,	what	's	the	purpose	of	 th 	 is 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	 a 	 s 	 	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	say	,	i	do	n't	think	you	're	 give 	 n 	 	money	or	fame	for	your	own	ego	,	ever	.
i	just	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	that	.
and	when	you	write	a	book	that	the	first	sentence	of	the	book	is	,	``	it	's	not	about	you	,	``	then	,	when	all	of	a	sudden	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	the	best	-	selling	book	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	you	got	to	figure	,	well	,	i	guess	it	's	not	about	me	.
that	's	kind	of	a	no	-	 brain 	 er 	 	.
so	,	what	is	it	for	?
and	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	think	about	what	i	call	the	``	 steward 	 ship 	 	of	 af 	 flu 	 ence 	 	``	and	the	``	 steward 	 ship 	 	of	influence	.	``
so	i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	 essential 	 ly 	 	,	that	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	is	 steward 	 ship 	 	.
that	if	you	are	a	 lead 	 er 	 	in	any	area	--	in	business	,	in	 politic 	 s 	 	,	in	 s 	 port 	 s 	 	,	in	art	,	in	 academic 	 s 	 	,	in	any	area	--	you	do	n't	own	it	;	you	are	a	steward	of	it	.
for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	that	's	why	i	 believ 	 e 	 	in	 protect 	 ing 	 	the	environment	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	my	planet	.	it	was	n't	mine	before	i	was	born	.
it	's	not	going	to	be	mine	after	i	die	.
i	'm	just	here	for	80	 year 	 s 	 	and	then	that	's	it	.
i	was	 deb 	 ating 	 	the	other	day	on	a	talk	show	,	and	the	guy	was	 challeng 	 ing 	 	me	and	go	,	``	what	's	a	pastor	 do 	 ing 	 	on	 protect 	 ing 	 	the	environment	?	``
and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	guy	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	do	you	 believ 	 e 	 	that	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	are	 respons 	 ible 	 	to	make	the	world	a	little	bit	better	place	for	the	next	generation	?
do	you	think	we	have	a	 steward 	 ship 	 	here	,	to	take	the	environment	 serious 	 ly 	 	?	``
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no.	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	oh	,	you	do	n't	?	``	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	let	me	make	 th 	 is 	 	clear	 aga 	 in 	 	.
do	you	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 a 	 s 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	--	i	'm	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 relig 	 ion 	 	--	do	you	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 a 	 s 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	it	is	our	 respons 	 ibility 	 	to	take	care	of	 th 	 is 	 	planet	and	make	it	just	a	little	bit	better	for	the	next	generation	?	``
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	.
not	any	more	than	any	other	species	.	``
when	he	 s 	 aid 	 	the	word	``	species	,	``	he	was	 reveal 	 ing 	 	his	 world 	 view 	 	.
and	he	was	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	i	'm	no	more	 respons 	 ible 	 	to	take	care	of	 th 	 is 	 	environment	than	a	duck	is	.	``
well	now	,	i	know	a	lot	of	 time 	 s 	 	we	act	like	 duck 	 s 	 	,	but	you	're	not	a	duck	.
you	're	not	a	duck	.
and	you	are	 respons 	 ible 	 	--	that	's	my	 world 	 view 	 	.
and	so	,	you	need	to	understand	what	your	 world 	 view 	 	is	.
the	problem	is	most	people	never	 re 	 ally 	 	think	it	through	.
they	never	 re 	 ally 	 	 cod 	 ify 	 	it	or	 qual 	 ify 	 	it	or	 quant 	 ify 	 	it	,	and	say	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	 believ 	 e 	 	in	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	why	i	 believ 	 e 	 	what	i	 believ 	 e 	 	.	``
i	do	n't	 personal 	 ly 	 	have	 en 	 ough 	 	faith	to	be	an	atheist	.
but	you	may	,	you	may	.
your	 world 	 view 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	 do 	 es 	 	determine	 every 	 thing 	 	else	in	your	life	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 determine 	 s 	 	your	 decision 	 s 	 	;	it	 determine 	 s 	 	your	 relationship 	 s 	 	;	it	 determine 	 s 	 	your	level	of	confidence	.
it	 determine 	 s 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	in	your	life	.
what	we	 believ 	 e 	 	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	--	and	you	know	 th 	 is 	 	--	 determine 	 s 	 	our	behavior	,	and	our	behavior	 determine 	 s 	 	what	we	 be 	 come 	 	in	life	.
so	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	money	 start 	 ed 	 	 pour 	 ing 	 	in	,	and	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	fame	 start 	 ed 	 	 pour 	 ing 	 	in	,	and	i	go	,	what	do	i	do	with	 th 	 is 	 	?
my	wife	and	i	first	made	five	 decision 	 s 	 	on	what	to	do	with	the	money	.
we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	first	,	we	're	not	going	to	use	it	on	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.	``
i	did	n't	go	out	and	buy	a	 big 	 ger 	 	house	.
i	do	n't	own	a	 guest 	 house 	 	.
i	still	drive	the	same	four	-	year	-	old	ford	that	i	've	driven	.
we	just	 s 	 aid 	 	,	we	're	not	going	to	use	it	on	us	.
the	second	thing	was	,	i	 stop 	 ped 	 	taking	a	 s 	 al 	 ary 	 	from	the	church	that	i	pastor	.
third	thing	is	,	i	 add 	 ed 	 	up	all	that	the	church	had	paid	me	over	the	last	25	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	i	 g 	 ave 	 	it	back	.
and	i	 g 	 ave 	 	it	back	 be 	 cause 	 	i	did	n't	want	 any 	 body 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	that	i	do	what	i	do	for	money	--	i	do	n't	.
in	fact	,	 personal 	 ly 	 	,	i	've	never	met	a	priest	or	a	pastor	or	a	 mini 	 ster 	 	who	 do 	 es 	 	it	for	money	.
i	know	that	's	a	 stereo 	 type 	 	.	i	've	never	met	one	of	them	.
 believ 	 e 	 	me	,	there	's	a	whole	lot	 eas 	 ier 	 	ways	to	make	money	.
 pastor 	 s 	 	are	like	on	24	-	 hour 	 s 	 	-	a	-	day	call	.	they	're	like	 doctor 	 s 	 	.
i	left	late	 to 	 day 	 	.	i	'd	 hop 	 ed 	 	to	be	here	 yester 	 day 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	my	father	-	in	-	law	is	in	his	last	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	,	48	 hour 	 s 	 	before	he	dies	of	cancer	.
and	i	'm	 watch 	 ing 	 	a	guy	who	's	lived	his	life	--	he	's	now	in	his	mid	-	80s	--	and	he	's	 dy 	 ing 	 	with	peace	.	you	know	,	the	test	of	your	 world 	 view 	 	is	not	how	you	act	in	the	good	 time 	 s 	 	.
the	test	of	your	 world 	 view 	 	is	how	you	act	at	the	funeral	.
and	 hav 	 ing 	 	 be 	 en 	 	through	 liter 	 ally 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	if	not	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 funeral 	 s 	 	,	it	 make 	 s 	 	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
it	 make 	 s 	 	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	what	you	 believ 	 e 	 	.
so	,	we	 g 	 ave 	 	it	all	back	,	and	then	we	set	up	three	 found 	 ations 	 	,	 work 	 ing 	 	on	some	of	the	major	 problem 	 s 	 	of	the	world	:	 il 	 liter 	 acy 	 	,	poverty	,	 pan 	 demic 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	--	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	hiv	/	 aid 	 s 	 	--	and	set	up	these	three	 found 	 ations 	 	,	and	put	the	money	 in 	 to 	 	that	.
the	last	thing	we	did	is	we	 be 	 came 	 	what	i	call	``	reverse	 tith 	 ers 	 	.	``
and	that	is	,	when	my	wife	and	i	got	married	30	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 tith 	 ing 	 	.
now	,	that	's	a	principle	in	the	 b 	 ible 	 	that	 say 	 s 	 	give	10	percent	of	what	you	get	back	to	 char 	 ity 	 	,	give	it	away	to	help	other	people	.
so	,	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	that	,	and	each	year	we	would	raise	our	 tith 	 e 	 	1	percent	.
so	,	our	first	year	of	marriage	we	went	to	11	percent	,	second	year	we	went	to	12	percent	,	and	the	third	year	we	went	to	13	percent	,	and	on	and	on	and	on	.	why	did	i	do	that	?
 be 	 cause 	 	every	time	i	give	,	it	 break 	 s 	 	the	grip	of	 material 	 ism 	 	in	my	life	.
 material 	 ism 	 	is	all	about	 get 	 ting 	 	--	get	,	get	,	get	,	get	all	you	can	,	can	all	you	get	,	 s 	 it 	 	on	the	can	and	spoil	the	rest	.
it	's	all	about	more	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	more	.
and	we	think	that	the	good	life	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	looking	good	--
that	's	most	 import 	 ant 	 	of	all	--	looking	good	,	 feel 	 ing 	 	good	and	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	 good 	 s 	 	.
but	that	's	not	the	good	life	.
i	meet	people	all	the	time	who	have	 t 	 hose 	 	,	and	they	're	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	happy	.
if	money	 actual 	 ly 	 	made	you	happy	,	then	the	 wealth 	 iest 	 	people	in	the	world	would	be	the	 hap 	 pies 	 t 	 	.
and	that	i	know	,	 personal 	 ly 	 	,	i	know	,	is	not	true	.
it	's	just	not	true	.
so	,	the	good	life	is	not	about	looking	good	,	 feel 	 ing 	 	good	or	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	 good 	 s 	 	;
it	's	about	 be 	 ing 	 	good	and	 do 	 ing 	 	good	.
giving	your	life	away	.
 sign 	 ific 	 ance 	 	in	life	 do 	 es 	 	n't	come	from	 stat 	 us 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	can	 al 	 ways 	 	find	 some 	 body 	 	who	's	got	more	than	you	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	come	from	 s 	 ex 	 	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	come	from	 s 	 al 	 ary 	 	.
it	 come 	 s 	 	from	 serv 	 ing 	 	.
it	is	in	giving	our	 live 	 s 	 	away	that	we	find	meaning	,	we	find	 sign 	 ific 	 ance 	 	.
that	's	the	way	we	 we 	 re 	 	wired	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	by	god	.
and	so	we	 beg 	 an 	 	to	give	away	,	and	now	after	30	 year 	 s 	 	,	my	wife	and	i	are	reverse	 tith 	 ers 	 	--	we	give	away	90	percent	and	live	on	10	.
that	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	was	the	easy	part	.
the	hard	part	is	,	what	do	i	do	with	all	 th 	 is 	 	attention	?
 be 	 cause 	 	i	start	 get 	 ting 	 	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 invit 	 ations 	 	.
i	just	came	off	a	 near 	 ly 	 	month	-	long	 s 	 peaking 	 	tour	on	three	different	 continent 	 s 	 	,	and	i	wo	n't	go	 in 	 to 	 	that	,	but	it	was	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	thing	.
and	i	'm	going	,	what	do	i	do	with	 th 	 is 	 	 no 	 to 	 riet 	 y 	 	that	the	book	 ha 	 s 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	?
and	 be 	 ing 	 	a	pastor	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 read 	 ing 	 	the	 b 	 ible 	 	.
there	's	a	chapter	in	the	 b 	 ible 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	psalm	72	,	and	it	's	solomon	's	 pray 	 er 	 	for	more	influence	.
when	you	read	 th 	 is 	 	 pray 	 er 	 	,	it	 sound 	 s 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 self 	 ish 	 	,	self	-	 center 	 ed 	 	.
it	 sound 	 s 	 	like	,	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	god	,	i	want	you	to	make	me	famous	.	``
that	's	what	he	 pray 	 s 	 	.
he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	want	you	to	make	me	famous	.
i	want	you	to	spread	the	fame	of	my	name	through	every	land	.	i	want	you	to	give	me	power	.	i	want	you	to	make	me	famous	.
i	want	you	to	give	me	influence	.	``
and	it	just	 sound 	 s 	 	like	the	most	 egot 	 istic 	 al 	 	request	you	could	make	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	pray	.
 un 	 til 	 	you	read	the	whole	psalm	,	the	whole	chapter	.
and	then	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	so	that	the	king	``	--	he	was	the	king	of	israel	at	that	time	at	 it 	 s 	 	 ap 	 ex 	 	in	power	--	``	so	that	the	king	may	care	for	the	widow	and	orphan	,	support	 depress 	 ed 	 	,	defend	the	 defense 	 less 	 	,	care	for	the	sick	,	assist	the	poor	,	speak	up	for	the	 foreign 	 er 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	in	 pri 	 son 	 	.	``
 bas 	 ically 	 	,	he	's	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	all	the	 marginal 	 ized 	 	in	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	read	that	,	i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	it	,	and	i	thought	,	you	know	,	what	 th 	 is 	 	is	 say 	 ing 	 	is	that	the	purpose	of	influence	is	to	speak	up	for	 t 	 hose 	 	who	have	no	influence	.
the	purpose	of	influence	is	not	to	build	your	ego	,	or	your	net	worth	.
and	,	by	the	way	,	your	net	worth	is	not	the	same	thing	 a 	 s 	 	your	self	-	worth	.
your	value	is	not	based	on	your	 valu 	 able 	 s 	 	;	it	's	based	on	a	whole	different	set	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	so	the	purpose	of	influence	is	to	speak	up	for	 t 	 hose 	 	who	have	no	influence	.
and	i	had	to	admit	,	i	ca	n't	think	of	the	last	time	i	thought	of	 widow 	 s 	 	and	 orphan 	 s 	 	.
they	're	not	on	my	radar	.
i	pastor	a	church	in	one	of	the	most	 af 	 fluent 	 	 area 	 s 	 	of	america	--	a	bunch	of	gated	 commun 	 ities 	 	.
i	have	a	church	full	of	ceos	and	 scientist 	 s 	 	.
and	i	could	go	five	 year 	 s 	 	and	never	,	ever	see	a	 home 	 less 	 	person	.
they	're	just	not	in	my	 path 	 way 	 	.
now	,	they	're	13	 mile 	 s 	 	up	the	road	in	santa	ana	.
so	,	i	had	to	say	,	``	ok	,	i	would	use	 what 	 ever 	 	 af 	 flu 	 ence 	 	and	 what 	 ever 	 	influence	i	've	got	to	help	 t 	 hose 	 	who	do	n't	have	either	of	 t 	 hose 	 	.	``
you	know	,	there	's	a	story	in	the	 b 	 ible 	 	about	moses	.
 whet 	 her 	 	you	 believ 	 e 	 	it	's	true	or	not	--	it	 re 	 ally 	 	did	n't	matter	to	me	.
but	moses	,	if	you	saw	the	movie	,	``	the	ten	 command 	 ments 	 	,	``	moses	 go 	 es 	 	out	,	and	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	 burn 	 ing 	 	bush	,	and	god	 talk 	 s 	 	to	him	.
and	god	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	moses	,	what	's	in	your	hand	?	``
i	think	that	's	one	of	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 question 	 s 	 	you	'll	ever	be	 ask 	 ed 	 	.
what	's	in	your	hand	?
moses	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	it	's	a	staff	.
it	's	a	shepherd	's	staff	.	``
and	god	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	throw	it	down	.	``
and	if	you	saw	the	movie	,	you	know	,	he	 throw 	 s 	 	it	down	and	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	snake	.
and	then	god	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	pick	it	up	.	``
and	he	 pick 	 s 	 	it	back	up	 aga 	 in 	 	,	and	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	staff	 aga 	 in 	 	.
now	,	i	'm	 read 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	thing	,	and	i	'm	going	,	what	is	that	all	about	?
ok	.	what	's	that	all	about	?	well	,	i	do	know	a	couple	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
number	one	,	god	never	 do 	 es 	 	a	miracle	to	show	off	.
it	's	not	just	,	``	 w 	 ow 	 	,	is	n't	that	cool	?	``
and	,	by	the	way	,	my	god	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	to	show	up	on	cheese	bread	.
you	know	,	if	god	's	going	to	show	up	,	he	's	not	going	to	show	up	on	cheese	bread	.
ok	?	i	just	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	why	i	love	what	michael	 do 	 es 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	like	,	ok	,	if	he	's	 debunk 	 ing 	 	it	,	then	i	do	n't	have	to	.
but	god	--	my	god	--	 do 	 es 	 	n't	show	up	on	 sprinkl 	 er 	 	 image 	 s 	 	.
he	got	a	few	more	 power 	 ful 	 	ways	than	that	to	do	 what 	 ever 	 	he	 want 	 s 	 	to	do	.
but	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	do	 miracle 	 s 	 	just	to	show	off	.
second	thing	is	,	if	god	ever	 ask 	 s 	 	you	a	question	,	he	 al 	 ready 	 	 know 	 s 	 	the	answer	.
 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	if	he	's	god	,	then	that	would	mean	that	when	he	 ask 	 s 	 	the	question	,	it	's	for	your	benefit	,	not	his	.
so	,	he	's	going	,	``	what	's	in	your	hand	?	``
now	,	what	was	in	moses	'	hand	?
well	,	it	was	a	shepherd	's	staff	.	now	,	follow	me	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	staff	 represent 	 ed 	 	three	 thing 	 s 	 	about	moses	'	life	.
first	,	it	 represent 	 ed 	 	his	 ident 	 ity 	 	.
he	was	a	shepherd	.	it	's	the	symbol	of	his	own	occupation	.
i	am	a	shepherd	.	it	's	a	symbol	of	his	 ident 	 ity 	 	,	his	 care 	 er 	 	,	his	job	.
second	,	it	's	a	symbol	of	not	 on 	 ly 	 	his	 ident 	 ity 	 	;	it	's	a	symbol	of	his	income	,	 be 	 cause 	 	all	of	his	 asset 	 s 	 	are	 ti 	 ed 	 	up	in	sheep	.
in	 t 	 hose 	 	 day 	 s 	 	 no 	 body 	 	had	bank	 account 	 s 	 	,	or	american	express	 card 	 s 	 	,	or	 hedg 	 e 	 	 fund 	 s 	 	.
your	 asset 	 s 	 	are	 ti 	 ed 	 	up	in	your	 flock 	 s 	 	.
so	it	's	a	symbol	of	his	 ident 	 ity 	 	,	and	it	's	a	symbol	of	his	income	.
and	the	third	thing	:	it	's	a	symbol	of	his	influence	.
what	do	you	do	with	a	shepherd	's	staff	?
well	,	you	know	,	you	move	sheep	from	point	a	to	point	b	with	it	,	by	hook	or	by	crook	.
you	pull	them	or	you	poke	them	,	one	or	the	other	.
so	,	he	's	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	you	're	going	to	lay	down	your	 ident 	 ity 	 	.
what	's	in	your	hand	?	you	've	got	 ident 	 ity 	 	;	you	've	got	income	;	you	've	got	influence	.
what	's	in	your	hand	?	``
and	he	's	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	if	you	lay	it	down	,	i	'll	make	it	come	 al 	 ive 	 	.
i	'll	do	some	 thing 	 s 	 	you	could	never	imagine	possible	.	``
and	if	you	've	 watch 	 ed 	 	that	movie	,	``	ten	 command 	 ments 	 	,	``	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	big	 miracle 	 s 	 	that	happen	in	egypt	are	 d 	 one 	 	through	 th 	 is 	 	staff	.
last	year	,	i	was	 invit 	 ed 	 	to	speak	at	nba	all	-	 star 	 s 	 	game	.
and	so	,	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	the	 player 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	most	of	the	nba	 team 	 s 	 	,	nfl	 team 	 s 	 	and	all	the	other	 team 	 s 	 	have	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	40	 day 	 s 	 	of	purpose	,	based	on	the	book	.
and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	's	in	your	hand	?
so	,	what	's	in	your	hand	?	``	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	it	's	a	 basket 	 ball 	 	,	and	that	 basket 	 ball 	 	 represent 	 s 	 	your	 ident 	 ity 	 	,	who	you	are	.
you	're	an	nba	player	.	it	 represent 	 s 	 	your	income	.
you	're	making	a	lot	of	money	off	that	little	ball	.
and	it	 represent 	 s 	 	your	influence	.
and	even	 th 	 ough 	 	you	're	 on 	 ly 	 	going	to	be	in	the	nba	for	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	you	're	going	to	be	an	nba	player	for	the	rest	of	your	life	.
and	that	 give 	 s 	 	with	you	enormous	influence	.
so	,	what	are	you	going	to	do	with	what	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	 give 	 n 	 	?	``
and	i	guess	that	's	the	main	reason	i	came	up	here	 to 	 day 	 	,	to	all	of	you	 ver 	 y 	 	bright	people	at	ted	,	is	to	say	,	``	what	's	in	your	hand	?	``
what	do	you	have	that	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	 give 	 n 	 	?
talent	,	 back 	 ground 	 	,	education	,	 free 	 dom 	 	,	 network 	 s 	 	,	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	,	wealth	,	 idea 	 s 	 	,	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	.
what	are	you	 do 	 ing 	 	with	what	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	 give 	 n 	 	?
that	,	to	me	,	is	the	 prim 	 ary 	 	question	about	life	.
that	,	to	me	,	is	what	 be 	 ing 	 	purpose	-	driven	is	all	about	.
in	the	book	i	talk	about	how	you	're	wired	to	do	certain	 thing 	 s 	 	,	you	're	shaped	.
 th 	 is 	 	little	cross	 take 	 s 	 	spiritual	 gift 	 s 	 	,	heart	,	ability	,	 personal 	 ity 	 	and	 experience 	 s 	 	.
these	 thing 	 s 	 	shape	you	.
and	if	you	want	to	know	what	you	ought	to	be	 do 	 ing 	 	with	your	life	,	you	need	to	look	at	your	shape	.	what	am	i	wired	to	do	?
why	would	god	wire	you	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	and	then	not	have	you	do	it	?
if	you	're	wired	to	be	an	 anthropo 	 logist 	 	,	you	'll	be	an	 anthropo 	 logist 	 	.
if	you	're	wired	to	be	an	 under 	 sea 	 	 explore 	 r 	 	,	you	'll	be	an	 under 	 sea 	 	 explore 	 r 	 	.
if	you	're	wired	to	make	 deal 	 s 	 	,	you	make	 deal 	 s 	 	.
if	you	're	wired	to	paint	,	you	paint	.
did	you	know	that	god	 s 	 mile 	 s 	 	when	you	be	you	?
when	my	little	 kid 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	little	--	they	're	all	grown	,	now	i	have	 grand 	 kid 	 s 	 	--	i	used	to	go	in	and	 s 	 it 	 	on	the	side	of	 the 	 ir 	 	bed	,	and	i	used	to	watch	my	 kid 	 s 	 	sleep	.
and	i	just	 watch 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	little	bodies	rise	and	lower	,	rise	and	lower	.
and	i	would	look	at	them	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	an	accident	.
rise	and	lower	--
and	i	got	joy	out	of	just	 watch 	 ing 	 	them	sleep	.
some	people	have	the	 mis 	 guide 	 d 	 	idea	that	god	 on 	 ly 	 	 get 	 s 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	when	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	,	quote	,	``	spiritual	 thing 	 s 	 	,	``	like	going	to	church	or	 help 	 ing 	 	the	poor	,	or	,	you	know	,	 confess 	 ing 	 	or	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
the	bottom	line	is	,	god	 get 	 s 	 	pleasure	 watch 	 ing 	 	you	be	you	.	why	?
he	made	you	.	and	when	you	do	what	you	 we 	 re 	 	made	to	do	,	he	 go 	 es 	 	,	``	that	's	my	boy	.
that	's	my	girl	.
you	're	using	the	talent	and	ability	that	i	 g 	 ave 	 	you	.	``
so	my	 ad 	 vice 	 	to	you	is	,	look	at	what	's	in	your	hand	--	your	 ident 	 ity 	 	,	your	influence	,	your	income	--	and	say	,	``	it	's	not	about	me	.
it	's	about	making	the	world	a	better	place	.	``
thank	you	.
