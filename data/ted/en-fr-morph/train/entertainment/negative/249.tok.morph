it	is	 interest 	 ing 	 	that	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	the	most	significant	health	-	care	budget	 go 	 es 	 	to	 cardio 	 vascular 	 	disease	care	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	private	or	public	.	there	's	no	 compar 	 ison 	 	at	all	.
in	africa	--	where	it	is	a	major	killer	--	it	is	 total 	 ly 	 	 ignor 	 ed 	 	.
and	that	 situ 	 ation 	 	can	not	be	right	.	we	must	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	it	.
a	health	 stat 	 us 	 	of	a	nation	 parallel 	 s 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	of	that	nation	.
17	million	people	die	every	year	from	heart	disease	.
32	million	heart	 attack 	 s 	 	and	 stroke 	 s 	 	occur	.
most	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	in	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	and	the	 major 	 ity 	 	is	in	africa	.
85	percent	of	global	disease	burden	for	 cardio 	 vascular 	 	disease
is	in	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	--	not	in	the	west	--
and	yet	90	percent	of	the	 resource 	 s 	 	are	in	the	west	.
who	is	at	risk	?	people	like	you	.
it	's	not	just	the	africans	that	should	be	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	that	.
all	 friend 	 s 	 	of	africa	,	that	will	have	reason	to	be	in	africa	at	some	point	in	time	,	should	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	 deplor 	 able 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
 ha 	 s 	 	 any 	 one 	 	here	 wonder 	 ed 	 	what	will	happen
if	you	go	back	to	your	room	at	night	,
and	you	start	 get 	 ting 	 	chest	 pain 	 s 	 	,	 short 	 ness 	 	of	breath	,	 sweat 	 ing 	 	?
you	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	heart	attack	.	what	are	you	going	to	do	?
will	you	fly	back	to	the	u.s.	,	germany	,	europe	?
no	,	you	will	die	.	50	percent	will	die	 with 	 in 	 	24	 hour 	 s 	 	,	if	not	 treat 	 ed 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	's	going	on	.
in	a	look	at	the	map	of	the	u.s.	--	the	graph	here	,	10	million	people	here	,	10	million	here	.
by	the	time	you	get	to	50	,	it	's	 al 	 most 	 	no	one	left	in	nigeria	--
life	 expect 	 ancy 	 	is	47	.
it	's	not	 be 	 cause 	 	some	people	do	n't	 surviv 	 e 	 	 child 	 hood 	 	 ill 	 ness 	 es 	 	--
they	do	--	but	they	do	not	 surviv 	 e 	 	after	the	time	that	they	reach	about	45	 year 	 s 	 	old	and	50	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	 time 	 s 	 	they	're	most	productive	.
 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	 time 	 s 	 	that	they	should	be	 con 	 trib 	 uting 	 
to	africa	's	 develop 	 ment 	 	.	but	they	're	not	there	.
the	best	way	to	spiral	 in 	 to 	 	a	cycle	of	poverty	is	to	kill	the	 parent 	 s 	 	.
if	you	can	not	secure	the	 parent 	 s 	 	,	you	can	not	guarantee	the	security	of	the	african	child	.
what	are	the	risk	 factor 	 s 	 	?
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	well	known	.	i	'm	not	going	to	 s 	 pend 	 	a	lot	of	time	on	 t 	 hose 	 	.
these	are	just	for	information	:	 hyper 	 tension 	 	,	diabetes	,	 obes 	 ity 	 	,	lack	of	 exercis 	 e 	 	.	the	usual	 suspect 	 s 	 	.
right	here	in	tanzania	,	30	percent	of	 individual 	 s 	 	have	 hyper 	 tension 	 	.
20	percent	are	 get 	 ting 	 	 treat 	 ed 	 	.
 on 	 ly 	 	less	than	one	percent	are	 ad 	 equate 	 ly 	 	 treat 	 ed 	 	.
if	we	can	treat	 hyper 	 tension 	 	 al 	 one 	 	in	africa	,	we	'll	 s 	 ave 	 	250,000	 live 	 s 	 	a	year	.	that	's	 quit 	 e 	 	significant	!
easy	to	treat	.	look	at	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	in	mauritius	.
in	eight	short	 year 	 s 	 	--	we	're	here	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	hiv	,	malaria	,
which	is	all	good	.
we	can	not	make	the	 mistak 	 es 	 	we	've	made	with	malaria	and	hiv	.
in	eight	short	 year 	 s 	 	,	non	-	 commun 	 ic 	 able 	 	 disease 	 s 	 
will	 be 	 come 	 	the	 lead 	 ing 	 	 cause 	 s 	 	of	death	in	africa	.
that	is	 some 	 thing 	 	to	keep	in	mind	.	we	ca	n't	deal	with	it	with	 situ 	 ations 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	typical	african	hospital	.	we	ca	n't	depend	on	the	 elite 	 s 	 	--
they	go	to	usa	,	germany	,	u.k.	for	 treat 	 ment 	 	.	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	.
you	ca	n't	depend	on	foreign	aid	 al 	 one 	 	.
here	is	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	:	 count 	 ries 	 	are	 turn 	 ing 	 	 in 	 ward 	 s 	 	.
post	-	9/11	,	[	the	]	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	had	a	lot	of	trouble
to	deal	with	,	 the 	 ir 	 	own	internal	 issue 	 s 	 	.
so	,	they	 s 	 pend 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	money	 try 	 ing 	 	to	fix	 t 	 hose 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	.
you	ca	n't	 right 	 ly 	 	--	it	's	not	 the 	 ir 	 	 respons 	 ibility 	 	,
it	is	my	 respons 	 ibility 	 	.	i	have	to	take	care	of	my	own	 problem 	 s 	 	.
if	they	help	,	that	's	good	!	but	that	is	not	my	 expect 	 ation 	 	.
these	 worsen 	 ing 	 	 indic 	 es 	 	of	health	care	or	health	 stud 	 ies 	 	in	africa
demand	a	new	look	.	we	can	not	keep	on	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	the	way	we	've	 al 	 ways 	 	 d 	 one 	 	them	.
if	they	have	not	 work 	 ed 	 	,	we	have	to	look	for	 alter 	 native 	 	 solution 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	here	to	talk	to	you	about	 solution 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	--	what	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	difficult	sign	to	some	of	us	.
 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	it	.
 every 	 one 	 	 know 	 s 	 	the	problem	.	no	one	 know 	 s 	 	what	the	 solution 	 s 	 	are	.
we	 decide 	 d 	 	that	we	 need 	 ed 	 	to	put	our	money	where	our	mouth	is	.
 every 	 one 	 	is	ready	to	throw	in	money	,
in	 term 	 s 	 	of	free	money	aid	to	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	.
talk	about	 sustain 	 able 	 	 invest 	 ment 	 	,	no	one	is	 interest 	 ed 	 	.
you	ca	n't	raise	money	.
i	have	 d 	 one 	 	 business 	 es 	 	in	 health 	 care 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	--
i	live	in	nashville	,	tennessee	,	health	care	capital	of	america	.
[	it	's	]	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	to	raise	money	for	health	-	care	 venture 	 s 	 	.
but	start	 tell 	 ing 	 	them	,	you	know	,	we	're	going	to	try	to	do	it	in	nigeria	--	 every 	 one 	 	 run 	 s 	 	away	.
that	is	 total 	 ly 	 	wrong	.	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	in	the	audience	here	,	if	you	want	to	help	africa	,	invest	money	in	 sustain 	 able 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
let	me	lead	you	through	a	day	in	the	life	of	the	heart	institute	,
so	you	get	a	 glimps 	 e 	 	of	what	we	do	,
and	i	'll	talk	a	little	bit	more	about	it	.
what	we	have	 d 	 one 	 	is	to	show	that	high	-	quality	health	care	,	 compar 	 able 	 	to	the	best	 any 	 where 	 	in	the	world	,	can	be	 d 	 one 	 	in	a	 develop 	 ing 	 	country	environment	.
we	have	25	 position 	 s 	 	right	now	--	all	of	them	trained	,	board	 cert 	 ified 	 	in	the	usa	,	canada	or	britain	.
we	have	every	 mod 	 ality 	 	that	can	be	 d 	 one 	 	in	vanderbilt	,	cleveland	clinic	--	 every 	 where 	 	in	the	u.s.	--
and	we	do	it	for	about	10	percent	of	the	cost	that	you	will	need	to	do	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
 add 	 ition 	 ally 	 	,	we	have	a	policy	that	no	one	is	ever	 turn 	 ed 	 	away	 be 	 cause 	 	of	ability	to	pay	.
we	take	care	of	 every 	 one 	 	.
 whet 	 her 	 	you	have	one	dollar	,	two	 dollar 	 s 	 	--	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	.
and	i	will	tell	you	how	we	're	able	to	do	it	.
we	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	we	select	our	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	 proper 	 ly 	 	.
we	go	for	modular	 unit 	 s 	 	.	 unit 	 s 	 	that	have	multi	-	 mod 	 ality 	 	 function 	 s 	 
have	modular	 component 	 s 	 	.	easy	to	repair	,	and	 be 	 cause 	 	of	that	,	we	do	not	take	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	not	 dur 	 able 	 	and	can	not	last	.
we	 emphas 	 ize 	 	training	,	and	we	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	process	is	 re 	 generative 	 	.
 ver 	 y 	 	soon	we	will	all	be	dead	and	gone	,	but	the	 problem 	 s 	 	will	stay	,
 un 	 less 	 	we	have	people	taking	over	from	where	we	 stop 	 ped 	 	.
we	made	 s 	 ure 	 	that	we	 produce 	 d 	 	some	 thing 	 s 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
we	do	not	buy	unit	 dose 	 s 	 	of	 radio 	 pharmaceutical 	 s 	 	.
we	get	the	 gene 	 rator 	 s 	 	from	the	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.
we	 manufactur 	 e 	 	them	in	-	house	,	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.	that	 keep 	 s 	 	the	 cost 	 s 	 	down	.
so	,	for	a	 radio 	 pharmaceutical 	 	in	the	u.s.	--	that	you	'll	get	a	unit	dose	for	250	 dollar 	 s 	 	--
when	we	're	 finish 	 ed 	 	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	it	in	-	house	,	we	come	at	a	price	of	about	two	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
we	 recogn 	 ize 	 	that	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	to	bridge	the	gap	between	the	rich	and	poor	 count 	 ries 	 	is	through	education	and	technology	.
all	these	 problem 	 s 	 	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	--	if	we	 br 	 ing 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	,	they	will	all	disappear	.
technology	is	a	great	 equal 	 izer 	 	.	how	do	we	make	it	work	?
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 prov 	 ed 	 	:	self	-	care	is	cost	-	effective	.
it	 extend 	 s 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	the	 r 	 ural 	 	 center 	 s 	 	,	and	we	can	use	 expert 	 ise 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	smart	way	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	way	our	 center 	 s 	 	are	set	up	.
we	 current 	 ly 	 	have	three	 location 	 s 	 	in	the	caribbean	,	and	we	're	 plan 	 ning 	 	a	fourth	one	.
and	we	have	now	 decide 	 d 	 	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	africa	.
we	will	be	 do 	 ing 	 	the	west	african	heart	institute
in	port	harcourt	,	nigeria	.	that	project	will	be	 start 	 ing 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	next	few	 month 	 s 	 	.	we	hope	to	open	in	2008-09	.
and	we	will	do	other	 center 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	model	can	be	 adapt 	 ed 	 	to	every	disease	process	.
all	the	 unit 	 s 	 	,	all	the	 center 	 s 	 	,	are	linked	through	a	 s 	 witch 	 ed 	 	hub	to	a	central	 serv 	 er 	 	,
and	all	the	 image 	 s 	 	are	 populate 	 d 	 	to	review	 station 	 s 	 	.
and	we	designed	 th 	 is 	 	 tele 	 medicine 	 	solution	.	it	's	 prop 	 riet 	 ary 	 	to	us	,	and	we	are	happy	to	share	what	we	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	with	 any 	 one 	 	who	is	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.	you	can	still	be	 profit 	 able 	 	.
we	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	the	 tele 	 medicine 	 	platform	 give 	 s 	 	access	to	expert	medical	 special 	 ists 	 	 any 	 where 	 	in	the	world	,	just	by	a	click	of	the	button	.
i	'll	lead	you	through	,	to	see	how	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	at	the	heart	institute	.	the	 doctor 	 s 	 	from	 any 	 where 	 	can	log	in	.
i	can	call	you	in	switzerland	and	say	,	``	listen	,	go	 in 	 to 	 	our	system	.
look	at	mrs.	jones	.	look	at	the	 stud 	 y 	 	,	tell	me	what	you	think	.	``	they	'll	give	me	that	information	,	and	we	'll	make	the	care	of	the	patient	better	.
the	patient	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	to	travel	.
he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	to	experience	the	 anxie 	 ty 	 	of	not	 know 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 limit 	 ed 	 	 expert 	 ise 	 	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	use	[	an	]	 electron 	 ic 	 	medical	record	system	.
i	'm	happy	to	say	that	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	have	 implement 	 ed 	 	--
80	percent	of	u.s.	 practice 	 s 	 	do	not	have	them	,	and	yet	the	technology	is	there	.
but	you	know	,	they	have	that	 luxur 	 y 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	ca	n't	get	it	in	nashville	,	you	can	travel	to	birmingham	,	two	 hour 	 s 	 	away	,	and	you	'll	get	it	.	if	you	ca	n't	get	it	in	cleveland	,	you	can	go	to	cincinnati	.	we	do	n't	have	that	 luxur 	 y 	 	,	so	we	have	to	make	it	happen	.
when	we	do	it	,	we	will	put	the	cost	of	care	down	.
and	we	'll	extend	it	to	the	 r 	 ural 	 	 center 	 s 	 	and	make	it	 afford 	 able 	 	.
and	 every 	 one 	 	will	get	the	care	they	deserve	.
it	can	not	just	be	technology	,	we	 recogn 	 ize 	 	that	.
 prevent 	 ion 	 	must	be	part	of	the	solution	--	we	 emphas 	 ize 	 	that	.
but	,	you	know	,	you	have	to	tell	people	what	can	be	 d 	 one 	 	.
it	's	not	possible	to	tell	people	to	do	what	is	going	to	be	expensive	,
and	they	go	home	and	ca	n't	do	it	.
they	need	to	be	 al 	 ive 	 	,	they	need	to	feed	.
we	recommend	 exercis 	 e 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	most	effective	,	simple	,	easy	thing	to	do	.
we	have	had	 walk 	 s 	 	every	year	--	every	march	,	april	.
we	form	people	 in 	 to 	 	 group 	 s 	 	and	make	them	go	 in 	 to 	 	 challeng 	 es 	 	.
which	group	 lose 	 s 	 	the	most	weight	,	we	give	them	 prize 	 s 	 	.
which	 group 	 s 	 	record	more	 walk 	 ing 	 	distance	by	 ped 	 o 	 meter 	 	,	we	give	them	 prize 	 s 	 	.	we	do	 th 	 is 	 	 constant 	 ly 	 	.
we	 encourag 	 e 	 	them	to	 br 	 ing 	 	children	.
that	way	we	start	 ex 	 posing 	 	the	children	from	 ver 	 y 	 	early	on	,	on	what	these	 issue 	 s 	 	are	.	 be 	 cause 	 	once	they	learn	it	,	they	will	stay	with	it	.	in	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	we	have	 create 	 d 	 	at	 l 	 east 	 	100	 skill 	 ed 	 	 job 	 s 	 	in	jamaica	 al 	 one 	 	,	and	these	are	 physician 	 s 	 	with	 expert 	 ise 	 	and	special	training	.
we	have	taken	care	of	over	1,000	 indi 	 gent 	 	 patient 	 s 	 	that	could	have	 di 	 ed 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	four	free	 pace 	 makers 	 	in	 patient 	 s 	 
with	complete	heart	block	.	for	 t 	 hose 	 	that	understand	 cardio 	 logy 	 	,	complete	heart	block	 mean 	 s 	 	certain	death	.
if	you	do	n't	get	 th 	 is 	 	 pace 	 maker 	 	,	you	will	be	dead	.
so	we	are	 pleas 	 ed 	 	with	that	.
 in 	 direct 	 ly 	 	,	we	have	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	the	government	of	jamaica	five	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	from	people	that	would	have	gone	to	miami	or	atlanta	for	care	.
and	we	've	 hope 	 fully 	 	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	a	lot	of	 live 	 s 	 	.
by	the	end	of	 th 	 is 	 	year	,	we	would	have	 con 	 tribute 	 d 	 	over	one	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	 indi 	 gent 	 	care	.	in	the	first	four	 month 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	340,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	 ave 	 rag 	 ing 	 	85,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	month	.	the	government	will	not	do	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	have	 com 	 pet 	 ing 	 	 need 	 s 	 	.
they	need	to	put	 resource 	 s 	 	 else 	 where 	 	.	but	we	can	still	do	it	.
people	say	,	``	how	can	you	do	that	?	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	we	can	do	that	.	at	 l 	 east 	 	4,000	rich	jamaicans	that	 we 	 re 	 	 head 	 ing 	 	to	miami	for	 treat 	 ment 	 	have	self	-	 confess 	 ed 	 	that	they	did	not	go	to	miami	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	heart	institute	of	the	caribbean	.
and	,	if	they	went	to	miami	,	they	will	 s 	 pend 	 	 significant 	 ly 	 	more	--	eight	to	10	 time 	 s 	 	more	.	and	they	feel	happy	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	it	at	home	,	 get 	 ting 	 	the	same	quality	of	care	.
and	for	that	money	--	for	every	one	patient	that	 ha 	 s 	 	the	money	to	pay	,	it	 give 	 s 	 	us	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	take	care	of	at	 l 	 east 	 	four	people	that	do	not	have	the	 resource 	 s 	 	to	pay	.
for	 th 	 is 	 	to	work	,	 th 	 is 	 	progress	must	be	 sustain 	 able 	 	.
so	,	we	 emphas 	 ize 	 	training	.	training	is	critical	.
we	have	gone	further	:	we	have	 form 	 ed 	 	a	relationship	with	the	university	of	technology	,	jamaica	,	where	i	now	have	an	appointment	.
and	we	are	 start 	 ing 	 	a	 bio 	 medical 	 	 engineer 	 ing 	 	program	,	so	that	we	will	train	people	 local 	 ly 	 	,	who	can	repair	that	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	.
that	way	we	're	not	going	to	deal	with	 obsolesc 	 ence 	 	and	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 issue 	 s 	 	.
we	're	 al 	 so 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	 anc 	 ill 	 ary 	 	health	-	care	technology	training	 program 	 s 	 	--
training	people	in	 echocardi 	 ography 	 	,	cardiac	 ultra 	 sound 	 	,
 t 	 hose 	 	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.	now	,	with	that	kind	of	training	,	it	 give 	 s 	 	people	 motiv 	 ation 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	now	they	will	get	a	 bachelor 	 s 	 	degree	in	medical	 im 	 aging 	 	and	all	that	kind	of	stuff	.	in	the	process	,	i	want	you	to	just	hear	from	the	 train 	 ees 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	what	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	for	them	.	dr.	jason	 top 	 ping 	 	:	my	name	is	jason	 top 	 ping 	 	.	i	'm	a	senior	resident	in	 an 	 est 	 hesia 	 	in	intensive	care

there	's	 be 	 en 	 	no	doubt	around	my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	about	the	 util 	 ity 	 	of	the	training	i	 receiv 	 ed 	 	here	,	and	i	think	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	an	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	interest	now	in	--	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	in	 echocardi 	 ography 	 	and	 it 	 s 	 	use	in	our	setting	.

ernest	madu	:	the	 less 	 on 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	it	can	be	 d 	 one 	 	,	and	it	can	be	 sustain 	 ed 	 	,	and	you	can	make	it	possible	for	 every 	 one 	 	.
who	are	we	to	decide	that	poor	people	can	not	get	the	best	care	?
when	have	you	 be 	 en 	 	 ap 	 point 	 ed 	 	to	play	god	?
it	is	not	my	decision	.	my	job	is	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	every	person	,	no	matter	what	fate	 ha 	 s 	 	 assign 	 ed 	 	to	you	,	will	have	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	get	the	best	quality	health	care	in	life	.
