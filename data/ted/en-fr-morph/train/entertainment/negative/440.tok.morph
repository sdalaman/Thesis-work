so	,	i	want	to	start	out	with	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	picture	from	my	 child 	 hood 	 	.
i	love	the	science	fiction	 movie 	 s 	 	.
here	it	is	:	``	 th 	 is 	 	 is 	 land 	 	earth	.	``
and	 leav 	 e 	 	it	to	hollywood	to	get	it	just	right	.
two	-	and	-	a	-	half	 year 	 s 	 	in	the	making	.
i	mean	,	even	the	 creation 	 ists 	 	give	us	6,000	,	but	hollywood	 go 	 es 	 	to	the	chase	.
and	in	 th 	 is 	 	movie	,	we	see	what	we	think	is	out	there	:	 fly 	 ing 	 	 saucer 	 s 	 	and	 alien 	 s 	 	.
every	world	 ha 	 s 	 	an	alien	,	and	every	alien	world	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 fly 	 ing 	 	saucer	,	and	they	move	about	with	great	speed	.	 alien 	 s 	 	.
well	,	don	brownlee	,	my	friend	,	and	i	 final 	 ly 	 	got	to	the	point	where	we	got	 tire 	 d 	 	of	 turn 	 ing 	 	on	the	tv	and	 see 	 ing 	 	the	 space 	 ship 	 s 	 	and	 see 	 ing 	 	the	 alien 	 s 	 	every	night	,	and	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	write	a	counter	-	argument	to	it	,	and	put	out	what	 do 	 es 	 	it	 re 	 ally 	 	take	for	an	earth	to	be	 habit 	 able 	 	,	for	a	planet	to	be	an	earth	,	to	have	a	place	where	you	could	 prob 	 ably 	 	get	not	just	life	,	but	 complex 	 ity 	 	,	which	 requir 	 es 	 	a	huge	amount	of	evolution	,	and	 there 	 fore 	 	 con 	 st 	 ancy 	 	of	 condition 	 s 	 	.
so	,	in	2000	we	wrote	``	rare	earth	.	``	in	2003	,	we	then	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	let	's	not	think	about	where	 earth 	 s 	 	are	in	space	,	but	how	long	 ha 	 s 	 	earth	 be 	 en 	 	earth	?
if	you	go	back	two	billion	 year 	 s 	 	,	you	're	not	on	an	earth	-	like	planet	any	more	.
what	we	call	an	earth	-	like	planet	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	short	 inter 	 val 	 	of	time	.	well	,	``	rare	earth	``	 actual 	 ly 	 	taught	me	an	awful	lot	about	 meet 	 ing 	 	the	public	.
right	after	,	i	got	an	 invit 	 ation 	 	to	go	to	a	science	fiction	convention	,	and	with	all	great	 earn 	 est 	 ness 	 	 walk 	 ed 	 	in	.
david	brin	was	going	to	debate	me	on	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	i	 walk 	 ed 	 	in	,	the	crowd	of	a	hundred	 start 	 ed 	 	 boo 	 ing 	 	 lust 	 ily 	 	.
i	had	a	girl	who	came	up	who	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	my	dad	 say 	 s 	 	you	're	the	devil	.	``
you	can	not	take	people	's	 alien 	 s 	 	away	from	them	and	expect	to	be	 any 	 body 	 	's	 friend 	 s 	 	.	well	,	the	second	part	of	that	,	soon	after	--	and	i	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	paul	allen	;	i	saw	him	in	the	audience	,	and	i	 hand 	 ed 	 	him	a	copy	of	``	rare	earth	.	``
and	jill	tarter	was	there	,	and	she	 turn 	 ed 	 	to	me	,	and	she	 look 	 ed 	 	at	me	just	like	that	girl	in	``	the	exorcist	.	``
it	was	,	``	it	 burn 	 s 	 	!	it	 burn 	 s 	 	!	``
 be 	 cause 	 	seti	 do 	 es 	 	n't	want	to	hear	 th 	 is 	 	.
seti	 want 	 s 	 	there	to	be	stuff	out	there	.
i	 re 	 ally 	 	applaud	the	seti	 effort 	 s 	 	,	but	we	have	not	heard	 any 	 thing 	 	yet	.
and	i	 re 	 ally 	 	do	think	we	have	to	start	 think 	 ing 	 	about	what	's	a	good	planet	and	what	is	n't	.
now	,	i	throw	 th 	 is 	 	slide	up	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 indic 	 ates 	 	to	me	that	,	even	if	seti	 do 	 es 	 	hear	 some 	 thing 	 	,	can	we	figure	out	what	they	 s 	 aid 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	slide	that	was	 pass 	 ed 	 	between	the	two	major	 intellig 	 ence 	 s 	 	on	earth	--	a	mac	to	a	pc	--	and	it	ca	n't	even	get	the	 letter 	 s 	 	right	--	--	so	how	are	we	going	to	talk	to	the	 alien 	 s 	 	?
and	if	they	're	50	light	 year 	 s 	 	away	,	and	we	call	them	up	,	and	you	 bl 	 ah 	 	,	 bl 	 ah 	 	,	 bl 	 ah 	 	,	 bl 	 ah 	 	,	 bl 	 ah 	 	,	and	then	50	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	it	 come 	 s 	 	back	and	they	say	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	repeat	?
i	mean	,	there	we	are	.
our	planet	is	a	good	planet	 be 	 cause 	 	it	can	keep	water	.
mars	is	a	bad	planet	,	but	it	's	still	good	 en 	 ough 	 	for	us	to	go	there	and	to	live	on	 it 	 s 	 	surface	if	we	're	 protect 	 ed 	 	.
but	venus	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	bad	--	the	worst	--	planet	.
even	 th 	 ough 	 	it	's	earth	-	like	,	and	even	 th 	 ough 	 	early	in	 it 	 s 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	it	may	 ver 	 y 	 	well	have	 harbor 	 ed 	 	earth	-	like	life	,	it	soon	 succumb 	 ed 	 	to	 run 	 away 	 	 green 	 house 	 	--	that	's	an	800	 degree 	 s 	 	[	fahrenheit	]	surface	--	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 ramp 	 ant 	 	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	.
well	,	we	know	from	 astro 	 biology 	 	that	we	can	 re 	 ally 	 	now	predict	what	's	going	to	happen	to	our	 part 	 icular 	 	planet	.
we	are	right	now	in	the	 beaut 	 iful 	 	oreo	of	 exist 	 ence 	 	--	of	at	 l 	 east 	 	life	on	planet	earth	--	 follow 	 ing 	 	the	first	 horr 	 ible 	 	 micro 	 bi 	 al 	 	age	.
in	the	cambrian	explosion	,	life	 emerge 	 d 	 	from	the	 swamp 	 s 	 	,	 complex 	 ity 	 	 a 	 rose 	 	,	and	from	what	we	can	tell	,	we	're	 half 	 way 	 	through	.
we	have	 a 	 s 	 	much	time	for	 animal 	 s 	 	to	exist	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	 a 	 s 	 	they	have	 be 	 en 	 	here	now	,	till	we	hit	the	second	 micro 	 bi 	 al 	 	age	.
and	that	will	happen	,	 paradox 	 ically 	 	--	 every 	 thing 	 	you	hear	about	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	--	when	we	hit	co	2	down	to	10	 part 	 s 	 	per	million	,	we	are	no	 long 	 er 	 	going	to	have	to	have	 plant 	 s 	 	that	are	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	have	any	 photo 	 synthesis 	 	,	and	there	go	 animal 	 s 	 	.
so	,	after	that	we	 prob 	 ably 	 	have	seven	billion	 year 	 s 	 	.	the	 s 	 un 	 	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	 intens 	 ity 	 	,	in	 it 	 s 	 	 bright 	 ness 	 	,	and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	at	about	12	billion	 year 	 s 	 	after	it	first	 start 	 ed 	 	,	the	earth	is	 consum 	 ed 	 	by	a	large	 s 	 un 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	's	left	.
so	,	a	planet	like	us	is	going	to	have	an	age	and	an	old	age	,	and	we	are	in	 it 	 s 	 	 gold 	 en 	 	summer	age	right	now	.
but	there	's	two	 fate 	 s 	 	to	 every 	 thing 	 	,	is	n't	there	?
now	,	a	lot	of	you	are	going	to	die	of	old	age	,	but	some	of	you	,	 horr 	 ibly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	are	going	to	die	in	an	accident	.
and	that	's	the	fate	of	a	planet	,	too	.
earth	,	if	we	're	 luck 	 y 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	--	if	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	get	hit	by	a	hale	-	bopp	,	or	 get 	 s 	 	 blast 	 ed 	 	by	some	supernova	 near 	 by 	 	in	the	next	seven	billion	 year 	 s 	 	--	we	'll	find	under	your	feet	.
but	what	about	 accident 	 al 	 	death	?
well	,	 paleonto 	 logists 	 	for	the	last	200	 year 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 chart 	 ing 	 	death	.	it	's	strange	--	 extinct 	 ion 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 con 	 cept 	 	was	n't	even	thought	about	 un 	 til 	 	baron	cuvier	in	france	found	 th 	 is 	 	first	 mast 	 odon 	 	.
he	could	n't	match	it	up	to	any	 bone 	 s 	 	on	the	planet	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	aha	!	it	's	extinct	.
and	 ver 	 y 	 	soon	after	,	the	fossil	record	 start 	 ed 	 	 yield 	 ing 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	idea	of	how	 man 	 y 	 	 plant 	 s 	 	and	 animal 	 s 	 	there	have	 be 	 en 	 	since	complex	life	 re 	 ally 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	to	 leav 	 e 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	fossil	record	.
in	that	complex	record	of	 fossil 	 s 	 	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	 time 	 s 	 	when	 lot 	 s 	 	of	stuff	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	be	 dy 	 ing 	 	out	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	and	the	father	/	mother	 geo 	 logists 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	these	``	mass	 extinct 	 ions 	 	.	``
all	 a 	 long 	 	it	was	thought	to	be	either	an	act	of	god	or	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	long	,	 s 	 low 	 	climate	change	,	and	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 change 	 d 	 	in	1980	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	 rock 	 y 	 	 out 	 crop 	 	near	gubbio	,	where	walter	alvarez	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	what	was	the	time	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	these	white	 rock 	 s 	 	,	which	held	 creature 	 s 	 	of	the	 cre 	 taceous 	 	period	,	and	the	pink	 rock 	 s 	 	above	,	which	held	tertiary	 fossil 	 s 	 	.
how	long	did	it	take	to	go	from	one	system	to	the	next	?
and	what	they	found	was	 some 	 thing 	 	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	.
they	found	in	 th 	 is 	 	gap	,	in	between	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	thin	clay	layer	,	and	that	clay	layer	--	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	thin	red	layer	here	--	is	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	 irid 	 ium 	 	.
and	not	just	 irid 	 ium 	 	;	it	's	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	 glass 	 y 	 	 s 	 ph 	 e 	 rule 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	 quar 	 tz 	 	 grain 	 s 	 	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	 subject 	 ed 	 	to	enormous	pressure	:	shock	 quar 	 tz 	 	.
now	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	slide	the	white	is	chalk	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	chalk	was	 deposit 	 ed 	 	in	a	warm	ocean	.
the	chalk	 it 	 self 	 	's	 compose 	 d 	 	by	plankton	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 fall 	 en 	 	down	from	the	sea	surface	onto	the	sea	floor	,	so	that	90	percent	of	the	sediment	here	is	skeleton	of	living	stuff	,	and	then	you	have	that	millimeter	-	thick	red	layer	,	and	then	you	have	black	rock	.
and	the	black	rock	is	the	sediment	on	the	sea	bottom	in	the	 ab 	 s 	 ence 	 	of	plankton	.
and	that	's	what	 happen 	 s 	 	in	an	 a 	 steroid 	 	 catastroph 	 e 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	what	 th 	 is 	 	was	,	of	course	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	famous	k	-	t	.
a	10	-	kilometer	body	hit	the	planet	.
the	 effect 	 s 	 	of	it	spread	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	thin	impact	layer	all	over	the	planet	,	and	we	had	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	the	death	of	the	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	,	the	death	of	these	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 ammo 	 nite 	 s 	 	,	leconteiceras	here	,	and	celaeceras	over	here	,	and	so	much	else	.
i	mean	,	it	must	be	true	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	've	had	two	hollywood	 block 	 buster 	 s 	 	since	that	time	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	paradigm	,	from	1980	to	about	2000	,	 total 	 ly 	 	 change 	 d 	 	how	we	 geo 	 logists 	 	thought	about	 catastroph 	 es 	 	.
prior	to	that	,	 uniform 	 itarianism 	 	was	the	 domin 	 ant 	 	paradigm	:	the	fact	that	if	 any 	 thing 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	on	the	planet	in	the	past	,	there	are	present	-	day	 process 	 es 	 	that	will	explain	it	.
but	we	have	n't	 witness 	 ed 	 	a	big	 a 	 steroid 	 	impact	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	type	of	neo	-	catastrophism	,	and	it	took	about	20	 year 	 s 	 	for	the	scientific	 establish 	 ment 	 	to	 final 	 ly 	 	come	to	 grip 	 s 	 	:	 y 	 es 	 	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	hit	;	and	 y 	 es 	 	,	the	 effect 	 s 	 	of	that	hit	 caus 	 ed 	 	a	major	mass	 extinct 	 ion 	 	.
well	,	there	are	five	major	mass	 extinct 	 ions 	 	over	the	last	500	million	 year 	 s 	 	,	 call 	 ed 	 	the	big	five	.
they	range	from	450	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	to	the	last	,	the	k	-	t	,	number	four	,	but	the	 big 	 gest 	 	of	all	was	the	p	,	or	the	permian	 extinct 	 ion 	 	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	mother	of	all	mass	 extinct 	 ions 	 	.
and	every	one	of	these	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 sub 	 sequent 	 ly 	 	 blame 	 d 	 	on	large	-	body	impact	.
but	is	 th 	 is 	 	true	?
the	most	 re 	 cent 	 	,	the	permian	,	was	thought	to	have	 be 	 en 	 	an	impact	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	structure	on	the	right	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	buckminsterfullerene	,	a	carbon	-	60	.	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	 t 	 hose 	 	 terr 	 ible 	 	 geo 	 de 	 s 	 ic 	 	 dom 	 es 	 	of	my	late	 be 	 love 	 d 	 	'60s	,
they	're	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 buckyball 	 s 	 	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	evidence	was	used	to	suggest	that	at	the	end	of	the	permian	,	250	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	a	 com 	 et 	 	hit	us	.
and	when	the	 com 	 et 	 	 hit 	 s 	 	,	the	pressure	 produce 	 s 	 	the	 buckyball 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 capture 	 s 	 	bits	of	the	 com 	 et 	 	.
 hel 	 ium 	 	-	3	:	 ver 	 y 	 	rare	on	the	surface	of	the	earth	,	 ver 	 y 	 	common	in	space	.
but	is	 th 	 is 	 	true	?
in	1990	,	 work 	 ing 	 	on	the	k	-	t	 extinct 	 ion 	 	for	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	 move 	 d 	 	to	south	africa	to	begin	work	twice	a	year	in	the	great	karoo	desert	.
i	was	so	 luck 	 y 	 	to	watch	the	change	of	that	south	africa	 in 	 to 	 	the	new	south	africa	 a 	 s 	 	i	went	year	by	year	.
and	i	 work 	 ed 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	permian	 extinct 	 ion 	 	,	 camp 	 ing 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	boer	 grave 	 yard 	 	for	 month 	 s 	 	at	a	time	.
and	the	 fossil 	 s 	 	are	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	.
you	know	,	you	're	 gaz 	 ing 	 	 up 	 on 	 	your	 ver 	 y 	 	 di 	 stant 	 	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	.
these	are	mammal	-	like	 reptil 	 es 	 	.
they	are	 cultural 	 ly 	 	 in 	 visible 	 	.	we	do	not	make	 movie 	 s 	 	about	these	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	gorgonopsian	,	or	a	gorgon	.
that	's	an	18	-	inch	long	skull	of	an	animal	that	was	 prob 	 ably 	 	seven	or	eight	feet	,	 sprawl 	 ed 	 	like	a	lizard	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	had	a	head	like	a	lion	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	top	carnivore	,	the	t	-	 r 	 ex 	 	of	 it 	 s 	 	time	.
but	there	's	 lot 	 s 	 	of	stuff	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	my	poor	son	,	patrick	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	 paleonto 	 logical 	 	child	abuse	.
hold	still	,	you	're	the	scale	.
there	was	big	stuff	back	then	.
fifty	-	five	species	of	mammal	-	like	 reptil 	 es 	 	.
the	age	of	 mammal 	 s 	 	had	well	and	 tru 	 ly 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	250	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	...
...	and	then	a	 catastroph 	 e 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
and	what	 happen 	 s 	 	next	is	the	age	of	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	.
it	was	all	a	 mistak 	 e 	 	;	it	should	have	never	 happen 	 ed 	 	.	but	it	did	.
now	,	 luck 	 ily 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	thrinaxodon	,	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	 rob 	 in 	 	egg	here	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	skull	i	've	 discover 	 ed 	 	just	before	taking	 th 	 is 	 	picture	--	there	's	a	pen	for	scale	;	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 tin 	 y 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	in	the	lower	triassic	,	after	the	mass	 extinct 	 ion 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 finish 	 ed 	 	.
you	can	see	the	eye	socket	and	you	can	see	the	little	 tee 	 th 	 	in	the	front	.
if	that	 do 	 es 	 	not	 surviv 	 e 	 	,	i	'm	not	the	thing	giving	 th 	 is 	 	talk	.
 some 	 thing 	 	else	is	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 surviv 	 e 	 	,	we	are	not	here	;	there	are	no	 mammal 	 s 	 	.	it	's	that	close	;	one	species	 ek 	 es 	 	through	.
well	,	can	we	say	 any 	 thing 	 	about	the	pattern	of	who	 surviv 	 es 	 	and	who	 do 	 es 	 	n't	?
here	's	sort	of	the	end	of	that	10	 year 	 s 	 	of	work	.
the	 range 	 s 	 	of	stuff	--	the	red	line	is	the	mass	 extinct 	 ion 	 	.
but	we	've	got	 surviv 	 ors 	 	and	 thing 	 s 	 	that	get	through	,	and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	get	through	 prefer 	 ential 	 ly 	 	are	cold	 blood 	 s 	 	.
warm	-	blooded	 animal 	 s 	 	take	a	huge	hit	at	 th 	 is 	 	time	.
the	 surviv 	 ors 	 	that	do	get	through	produce	 th 	 is 	 	world	of	crocodile	-	like	 creature 	 s 	 	.
there	's	no	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	yet	;	just	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 low 	 	,	 saur 	 ian 	 	,	 scal 	 y 	 	,	nasty	,	 swamp 	 y 	 	place	with	a	couple	of	 tin 	 y 	 	 mammal 	 s 	 	 hid 	 ing 	 	in	the	 fringe 	 s 	 	.
and	there	they	would	hide	for	160	million	 year 	 s 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	 liberate 	 d 	 	by	that	k	-	t	 a 	 steroid 	 	.
so	,	if	not	impact	,	what	?
and	the	what	,	i	think	,	is	that	we	 return 	 ed 	 	,	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	,	to	the	pre	-	cambrian	world	,	that	first	 micro 	 bi 	 al 	 	age	,	and	the	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	are	still	out	there	.
they	hate	we	 animal 	 s 	 	.
they	 re 	 ally 	 	want	 the 	 ir 	 	world	back	.
and	they	've	 tri 	 ed 	 	over	and	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 suggest 	 s 	 	to	me	that	life	 caus 	 ing 	 	these	mass	 extinct 	 ions 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	did	is	 inherent 	 ly 	 	anti	-	gaian	.
 th 	 is 	 	whole	gaia	idea	,	that	life	 make 	 s 	 	the	world	better	for	 it 	 self 	 	--	 any 	 body 	 	 be 	 en 	 	on	a	 free 	 way 	 	on	a	friday	afternoon	in	los	angeles	 believ 	 ing 	 	in	the	gaia	 theor 	 y 	 	?	no	.
so	,	i	 re 	 ally 	 	suspect	there	's	an	 alter 	 native 	 	,	and	that	life	 do 	 es 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	try	to	do	 it 	 self 	 	in	--	not	 conscious 	 ly 	 	,	but	just	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 do 	 es 	 	.
and	here	's	the	weapon	,	it	 seem 	 s 	 	,	that	it	did	so	over	the	last	500	million	 year 	 s 	 	.
there	are	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	which	,	through	 the 	 ir 	 	 metabol 	 ism 	 	,	produce	hydrogen	sulfide	,	and	they	do	so	in	large	 amount 	 s 	 	.
hydrogen	sulfide	is	 ver 	 y 	 	fatal	to	we	 human 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	small	 a 	 s 	 	200	 part 	 s 	 	per	million	will	kill	you	.
you	 on 	 ly 	 	have	to	go	to	the	black	sea	and	a	few	other	 place 	 s 	 	--	some	 lake 	 s 	 	--	and	get	down	,	and	you	'll	find	that	the	water	 it 	 self 	 	 turn 	 s 	 	 pur 	 ple 	 	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	 pur 	 ple 	 	from	the	presence	of	 nume 	 r 	 ous 	 	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	which	have	to	have	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	and	have	to	have	hydrogen	sulfide	,	and	we	can	detect	 the 	 ir 	 	presence	 to 	 day 	 	--	we	can	see	them	--	but	we	can	 al 	 so 	 	detect	 the 	 ir 	 	presence	in	the	past	.
and	the	last	three	 year 	 s 	 	have	 s 	 een 	 	an	enormous	 break 	 through 	 	in	a	brand	-	new	field	.
i	am	 al 	 most 	 	extinct	--	i	'm	a	 paleonto 	 logist 	 	who	 collect 	 s 	 	 fossil 	 s 	 	.
but	the	new	wave	of	 paleonto 	 logists 	 	--	my	graduate	 student 	 s 	 	--	collect	 bio 	 marker 	 s 	 	.
they	take	the	sediment	 it 	 self 	 	,	they	 ex 	 tract 	 	the	oil	from	it	,	and	from	that	they	can	produce	 com 	 pound 	 s 	 	which	turn	out	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	specific	to	 part 	 icular 	 	 micro 	 bi 	 al 	 	 group 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	 lipid 	 s 	 	are	so	tough	,	they	can	get	 preserve 	 d 	 	in	sediment	and	last	the	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	 necess 	 ary 	 	,	and	be	 extra 	 cted 	 	and	tell	us	who	was	there	.
and	we	know	who	was	there	.	at	the	end	of	the	permian	,	at	 man 	 y 	 	of	these	mass	 extinct 	 ion 	 	 bound 	 aries 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	find	:	isorenieratene	.	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	specific	.
it	can	 on 	 ly 	 	occur	if	the	surface	of	the	ocean	 ha 	 s 	 	no	oxygen	,	and	is	 total 	 ly 	 	 saturate 	 d 	 	with	hydrogen	sulfide	--	 en 	 ough 	 	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	to	come	out	of	solution	.
 th 	 is 	 	led	lee	kump	,	and	 other 	 s 	 	from	penn	state	and	my	group	,	to	 pro 	 pose 	 	what	i	call	the	kump	 hypo 	 thesis 	 	:	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	mass	 extinct 	 ions 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 caus 	 ed 	 	by	 lower 	 ing 	 	oxygen	,	by	high	co	2.	and	the	worst	effect	of	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	:	hydrogen	sulfide	 be 	 ing 	 	 produce 	 d 	 	out	of	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	.
well	,	what	's	the	source	of	 th 	 is 	 	?
in	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	case	,	the	source	over	and	over	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	flood	 basalt 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	view	of	the	earth	now	,	if	we	 ex 	 tract 	 	a	lot	of	it	.
and	each	of	these	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	hydrogen	bomb	;	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	the	 effect 	 s 	 	are	even	 wo 	 rse 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	when	deep	-	earth	material	 come 	 s 	 	to	the	surface	,	 spread 	 s 	 	out	over	the	surface	of	the	planet	.
well	,	it	's	not	the	lava	that	 kill 	 s 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	,
it	's	the	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	that	 come 	 s 	 	out	with	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	volvos	;	 th 	 is 	 	is	 volcan 	 o 	 es 	 	.
but	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	is	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	.
so	,	these	are	new	data	rob	berner	and	i	--	from	yale	--	put	together	,	and	what	we	try	to	do	now	is	track	the	amount	of	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	in	the	entire	rock	record	--	and	we	can	do	 th 	 is 	 	from	a	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 mean 	 s 	 	--	and	put	all	the	red	lines	here	,	when	these	--	what	i	call	 green 	 house 	 	mass	 extinct 	 ions 	 	--	took	place	.
and	there	's	two	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 re 	 ally 	 	evident	here	to	me	,	is	that	these	 extinct 	 ions 	 	take	place	when	co	2	is	going	up	.
but	the	second	thing	that	's	not	 show 	 n 	 	on	here	:	the	earth	 ha 	 s 	 	never	had	any	ice	on	it	when	we	've	had	1,000	 part 	 s 	 	per	million	co	2	.
we	are	at	380	and	 climb 	 ing 	 	.
we	should	be	up	to	a	thousand	in	three	centuries	at	the	most	,	but	my	friend	david	battisti	in	seattle	 say 	 s 	 	he	 think 	 s 	 	a	100	 year 	 s 	 	.
so	,	there	 go 	 es 	 	the	ice	 cap 	 s 	 	,	and	there	 come 	 s 	 	240	feet	of	sea	level	rise	.
i	live	in	a	view	house	now	;	i	'm	going	to	have	 water 	 front 	 	.
all	right	,	what	's	the	 con 	 sequence 	 	?	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	 prob 	 ably 	 	turn	 pur 	 ple 	 	.
and	we	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	reason	that	 complex 	 ity 	 	took	so	long	to	take	place	on	planet	earth	.
we	had	these	hydrogen	sulfide	 ocean 	 s 	 	for	a	 ver 	 y 	 	great	long	period	.
they	stop	complex	life	from	 exist 	 ing 	 	.
we	know	hydrogen	sulfide	is	 erupt 	 ing 	 	 present 	 ly 	 	a	few	 place 	 s 	 	on	the	planet	.
and	i	throw	 th 	 is 	 	slide	in	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	me	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	two	 month 	 s 	 	ago	--	and	i	throw	 th 	 is 	 	slide	in	 be 	 cause 	 	here	is	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	animal	,	 chamber 	 ed 	 	 na 	 util 	 us 	 	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	since	the	 animal 	 s 	 	first	 start 	 ed 	 	--	500	million	 year 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 track 	 ing 	 	experiment	,	and	any	of	you	scuba	divers	,	if	you	want	to	get	 involve 	 d 	 	in	one	of	the	 cool 	 est 	 	 project 	 s 	 	ever	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	off	the	great	 bar 	 rier 	 	reef	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	we	speak	now	,	these	 na 	 util 	 us 	 	are	 track 	 ing 	 	out	 the 	 ir 	 	 behavior 	 s 	 	to	us	.
but	the	thing	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	every	once	in	a	while	we	divers	can	run	 in 	 to 	 	trouble	,	so	i	'm	going	to	do	a	little	thought	experiment	here	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	great	white	 s 	 hark 	 	that	ate	some	of	my	 trap 	 s 	 	.
we	 pull 	 ed 	 	it	up	;	up	it	 come 	 s 	 	.	so	,	it	's	out	there	with	me	at	night	.
so	,	i	'm	 swimm 	 ing 	 	 a 	 long 	 	,	and	it	 take 	 s 	 	off	my	leg	.
i	'm	80	 mile 	 s 	 	from	shore	,	what	's	going	to	happen	to	me	?
well	now	,	i	die	.
five	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	hope	 happen 	 s 	 	to	me	:	i	'm	taken	back	to	the	boat	,	i	'm	 give 	 n 	 	a	gas	mask	:	80	 part 	 s 	 	per	million	hydrogen	sulfide	.
i	'm	then	 throw 	 n 	 	in	an	ice	pond	,	i	'm	 cool 	 ed 	 	15	 degree 	 s 	 	lower	and	i	could	be	taken	to	a	critical	care	hospital	.
and	the	reason	i	could	do	that	is	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 mammal 	 s 	 	have	gone	through	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	these	hydrogen	sulfide	 event 	 s 	 	,	and	our	bodies	have	 adapt 	 ed 	 	.
and	we	can	now	use	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	what	i	think	will	be	a	major	medical	 break 	 through 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	mark	roth	.	he	was	funded	by	darpa	.
 tri 	 ed 	 	to	figure	out	how	to	 s 	 ave 	 	americans	after	 battle 	 field 	 	 inju 	 ries 	 	.
he	 ble 	 ed 	 s 	 	out	 pig 	 s 	 	.
he	 put 	 s 	 	in	80	 part 	 s 	 	per	million	hydrogen	sulfide	--	the	same	stuff	that	 surviv 	 ed 	 	these	past	mass	 extinct 	 ions 	 	--	and	he	 turn 	 s 	 	a	mammal	 in 	 to 	 	a	 reptil 	 e 	 	.
``	i	 believ 	 e 	 	we	are	 see 	 ing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	the	result	of	 mammal 	 s 	 	and	 reptil 	 es 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	 under 	 gone 	 	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 expo 	 s 	 ures 	 	to	h	2s	.	``
i	got	 th 	 is 	 	email	from	him	two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	;	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	think	i	've	got	an	answer	to	some	of	your	 question 	 s 	 	.	``
so	,	he	now	 ha 	 s 	 	taken	 mic 	 e 	 	down	for	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 a 	 s 	 	four	 hour 	 s 	 	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	six	 hour 	 s 	 	,	and	these	are	brand	-	new	data	he	 s 	 ent 	 	me	on	the	way	over	here	.
on	the	top	,	now	,	that	is	a	temperature	record	of	a	mouse	who	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	through	--	the	 dot 	 ted 	 	line	,	the	 temperature 	 s 	 	.
so	,	the	temperature	 start 	 s 	 	at	25	 cent 	 i 	 grade 	 	,	and	down	it	 go 	 es 	 	,	down	it	 go 	 es 	 	.
six	 hour 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	up	 go 	 es 	 	the	temperature	.
now	,	the	same	mouse	is	 give 	 n 	 	80	 part 	 s 	 	per	million	hydrogen	sulfide	in	 th 	 is 	 	solid	graph	,	and	look	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	 it 	 s 	 	temperature	.
 it 	 s 	 	temperature	 drop 	 s 	 	.
it	 go 	 es 	 	down	to	15	 degree 	 s 	 	 cent 	 i 	 grade 	 	from	35	,	and	 come 	 s 	 	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	 perfect 	 ly 	 	fine	.
here	is	a	way	we	can	get	people	to	critical	care	.
here	's	how	we	can	 br 	 ing 	 	people	cold	 en 	 ough 	 	to	last	till	we	get	critical	care	.
now	,	you	're	all	 think 	 ing 	 	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	what	about	the	brain	tissue	?
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	great	 challeng 	 es 	 	that	is	going	to	happen	.
you	're	in	an	accident	.	you	've	got	two	 choice 	 s 	 	:	you	're	going	to	die	,	or	you	're	going	to	take	the	hydrogen	sulfide	and	,	say	,	75	percent	of	you	is	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	,	 ment 	 ally 	 	.
what	are	you	going	to	do	?
do	we	all	have	to	have	a	little	button	 say 	 ing 	 	,	let	me	die	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	coming	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	us	,	and	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	be	a	revolution	.
we	're	going	to	 s 	 ave 	 	 live 	 s 	 	,	but	there	's	going	to	be	a	cost	to	it	.
the	new	view	of	mass	 extinct 	 ions 	 	is	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	hit	,	and	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	we	have	to	think	about	the	long	term	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	will	get	hit	 aga 	 in 	 	.
but	there	's	a	far	 wo 	 rse 	 	danger	 confront 	 ing 	 	us	.
we	can	 eas 	 ily 	 	go	back	to	the	hydrogen	sulfide	world	.
give	us	a	few	millennia	--	and	we	 human 	 s 	 	should	last	 t 	 hose 	 	few	millennia	--	will	it	happen	 aga 	 in 	 	?	if	we	 continu 	 e 	 	,	it	'll	happen	 aga 	 in 	 	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	of	us	flew	here	?
how	 man 	 y 	 	of	us	have	gone	through	our	entire	kyoto	quota	just	for	 fly 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	?
how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	have	 exceed 	 ed 	 	it	?	 yea 	 h 	 	,	i	've	 certain 	 ly 	 	 exceed 	 ed 	 	it	.
we	have	a	huge	problem	facing	us	 a 	 s 	 	a	species	.
we	have	to	beat	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	want	to	be	able	to	go	back	to	 th 	 is 	 	reef	.	thank	you	.
chris	anderson	:	i	've	just	got	one	question	for	you	,	peter	.
am	i	 understand 	 ing 	 	you	right	,	that	what	you	're	 say 	 ing 	 	here	is	that	we	have	in	our	own	bodies	a	 bio 	 chemical 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	to	hydrogen	sulfide	that	in	your	mind	 prove 	 s 	 	that	there	have	 be 	 en 	 	past	mass	 extinct 	 ions 	 	due	to	climate	change	?
peter	ward	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	every	single	cell	in	us	can	produce	minute	 quant 	 ities 	 	of	hydrogen	sulfide	in	great	 cri 	 s 	 es 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	roth	 ha 	 s 	 	found	out	.
so	,	what	we	're	looking	at	now	:	 do 	 es 	 	it	 leav 	 e 	 	a	signal	?
 do 	 es 	 	it	 leav 	 e 	 	a	signal	in	bone	or	in	plant	?
and	we	go	back	to	the	fossil	record	and	we	could	try	to	detect	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	these	have	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	past	.
ca	:	it	's	 simultaneous 	 ly 	 	an	 in 	 credible 	 	medical	 techni 	 que 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	a	 terrify 	 ing 	 	...
