you	hear	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	era	of	environment	--	or	biology	,	or	information	technology	...	well	,	it	's	the	era	of	a	lot	of	different	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	're	in	right	now	.	but	one	thing	for	 s 	 ure 	 	:	it	's	the	era	of	change	.	there	's	more	change	going	on	than	ever	 ha 	 s 	 	 occur 	 red 	 	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	human	life	on	earth	.
and	you	all	sort	of	know	it	,	but	it	's	hard	to	get	it	so	that	you	 re 	 ally 	 	understand	it	.
and	i	've	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	put	together	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	a	good	start	for	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	've	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	show	in	 th 	 is 	 	--	 th 	 ough 	 	the	color	 do 	 es 	 	n't	come	out	--
that	what	i	'm	 concern 	 ed 	 	with	is	the	little	50	-	year	time	bubble	that	you	are	in	.	you	tend	to	be	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	a	generation	past	,	a	generation	future	--	your	 parent 	 s 	 	,	your	 kid 	 s 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	you	can	change	over	the	next	few	 decade 	 s 	 	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	50	-	year	time	bubble	you	kind	of	move	 a 	 long 	 	in	.	and	in	that	50	 year 	 s 	 	,	if	you	look	at	the	population	 curv 	 e 	 	,	you	find	the	population	of	 human 	 s 	 	on	the	earth	more	than	 double 	 s 	 	and	we	're	up	three	-	and	-	a	-	half	 time 	 s 	 	since	i	was	born	.	when	you	have	a	new	baby	,	by	the	time	that	kid	 get 	 s 	 	out	of	high	school	more	people	will	be	 add 	 ed 	 	than	 exist 	 ed 	 	on	earth	when	i	was	born	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	unprecedented	,	and	it	's	big	.
where	it	 go 	 es 	 	in	the	future	is	 question 	 ed 	 	.	so	that	's	the	human	part	.
now	,	the	human	part	related	to	 animal 	 s 	 	:	look	at	the	left	side	of	that	.
what	i	call	the	human	 port 	 ion 	 	--	 human 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 stock 	 	and	 pet 	 s 	 	--	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	the	natural	 port 	 ion 	 	--	all	the	other	wild	 animal 	 s 	 	and	just	--	these	are	 vertebrate 	 s 	 	and	all	the	 bird 	 s 	 	,	etc	.	,	in	the	land	and	air	,	not	in	the	water	.	how	 do 	 es 	 	it	balance	?
 certain 	 ly 	 	,	10,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	the	 civil 	 ization 	 	's	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	the	human	 port 	 ion 	 	was	less	than	one	tenth	of	one	percent	.	let	's	look	at	it	now	.
you	follow	 th 	 is 	 	 curv 	 e 	 	and	you	see	the	 white 	 r 	 	spot	in	the	middle	--	that	's	your	50	-	year	time	bubble	.	 human 	 s 	 	,	 live 	 stock 	 	and	 pet 	 s 	 	are	now	97	percent	of	that	 integrate 	 d 	 	total	mass	on	earth	and	all	wild	nature	is	three	percent	.	we	have	won	.	the	next	generation	 do 	 es 	 	n't	even	have	to	worry	about	 th 	 is 	 	game	--	it	is	over	.
and	the	 big 	 gest 	 	problem	came	in	the	last	25	 year 	 s 	 	:	it	went	from	25	percent	up	to	that	97	percent	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	is	a	 sober 	 ing 	 	picture	 up 	 on 	 	 real 	 izing 	 	that	we	,	 human 	 s 	 	,	are	in	charge	of	life	on	earth	;	we	're	like	the	 capric 	 ious 	 	 god 	 s 	 	of	old	greek	 myth 	 s 	 	,	kind	of	 play 	 ing 	 	with	life	--	and	not	a	great	deal	of	 wis 	 dom 	 	 inject 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	it	.
now	,	the	third	 curv 	 e 	 	is	information	technology	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	moore	's	law	 plot 	 ted 	 	here	,	which	 relat 	 es 	 	to	density	of	information	,	but	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	for	 show 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	other	 thing 	 s 	 	about	information	technology	--	 computer 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	use	,	 inter 	 net 	 	,	etc	.	and	what	's	 import 	 ant 	 	is	it	just	 go 	 es 	 	straight	up	through	the	top	of	the	 curv 	 e 	 	,	and	 ha 	 s 	 	no	real	 limit 	 s 	 	to	it	.	now	try	and	contrast	these	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	earth	going	through	that	same	--	--	frame	.	and	to	make	it	 re 	 ally 	 	clear	,	i	've	put	all	four	on	one	graph	.	there	's	no	need	to	see	the	little	 detail 	 ed 	 	 word 	 s 	 	on	it	.
that	first	one	is	 human 	 s 	 	-	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	-	nature	;
we	've	won	,	there	's	no	more	gain	.	human	population	.
and	so	if	you	're	looking	for	growth	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	to	get	 in 	 to 	 	,	that	's	not	a	good	one	--	 protect 	 ing 	 	natural	 creature 	 s 	 	.	human	population	is	going	up	;	it	's	going	to	 continu 	 e 	 	for	 quit 	 e 	 	a	while	.
good	business	in	 obstetric 	 ians 	 	,	 mort 	 ic 	 ians 	 	,	and	 farm 	 ing 	 	,	housing	,	etc	.	--	they	all	deal	with	human	bodies	,	which	 requir 	 e 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	fed	,	 transport 	 ed 	 	,	 house 	 d 	 	and	so	on	.	and	the	information	technology	,	which	 connect 	 s 	 	to	our	 brain 	 s 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	no	limit	--	now	,	that	is	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	field	to	be	in	.	you	're	looking	for	growth	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	?	it	's	just	going	up	through	the	roof	.
and	then	,	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	earth	.	 some 	 how 	 	making	these	all	compatible	with	the	earth	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	bad	industry	to	be	 involve 	 d 	 	with	.
so	,	that	's	the	stage	out	of	all	 th 	 is 	 	.	i	find	,	for	 reason 	 s 	 	i	do	n't	understand	,	i	 re 	 ally 	 	do	have	a	goal	.
and	the	goal	is	that	the	world	be	 desir 	 able 	 	and	 sustain 	 able 	 	when	my	 kid 	 s 	 	reach	my	age	--	and	i	think	that	's	--	in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	the	next	generation	.	i	think	that	's	a	goal	that	we	 prob 	 ably 	 	all	share	.
i	think	it	's	a	 hope 	 less 	 	goal	.	 techno 	 logically 	 	,	it	's	 achiev 	 able 	 	;	 economic 	 ally 	 	,	it	's	 achiev 	 able 	 	;	 politic 	 ally 	 	,	it	 mean 	 s 	 	sort	of	the	 habit 	 s 	 	,	 institution 	 s 	 	of	people	--	it	's	 im 	 possible 	 	.
the	 institution 	 s 	 	of	the	past	with	all	 the 	 ir 	 	 in 	 ertia 	 	are	just	 ir 	 relevant 	 	for	the	future	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	they	're	there	and	we	have	to	deal	with	them	.	i	 s 	 pend 	 	about	15	percent	of	my	time	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 s 	 ave 	 	the	world	,	the	other	85	percent	,	the	usual	--	and	 what 	 ever 	 	else	we	devote	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	.
and	in	that	15	percent	,	the	main	focus	is	on	human	mind	,	 think 	 ing 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	,
 some 	 how 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	unleash	 kid 	 s 	 	from	the	 straight 	 jacket 	 	of	school	,	which	is	 put 	 ting 	 	information	and	dogma	 in 	 to 	 	them	,	get	them	so	they	 re 	 ally 	 	think	,	ask	tough	 question 	 s 	 	,	 argu 	 e 	 	about	serious	 subject 	 s 	 	,	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	that	's	in	the	book	,	think	 broad 	 ly 	 	or	creative	.	they	can	be	.
our	school	 system 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 flaw 	 ed 	 	and	do	not	reward	you	for	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 import 	 ant 	 	in	life	or	for	the	 surviv 	 al 	 	of	 civil 	 ization 	 	;	they	reward	you	for	a	lot	of	 learn 	 ing 	 	and	 s 	 op 	 ping 	 	up	stuff	.
we	ca	n't	go	 in 	 to 	 	that	 to 	 day 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	there	is	n't	time	--	it	's	a	broad	subject	.	one	thing	for	 s 	 ure 	 	,	in	the	future	there	is	an	essential	feature	--	 necess 	 ary 	 	,	but	not	sufficient	--	which	is	 do 	 ing 	 	more	with	less	.	we	've	got	to	be	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	with	more	efficiency	using	less	energy	,	less	material	.
your	great	-	great	 grand 	 parent 	 s 	 	got	by	on	muscle	power	,	and	yet	we	all	think	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	huge	power	that	's	essential	for	our	 life 	 style 	 	.	and	with	all	the	 wonder 	 ful 	 	technology	we	have	we	can	do	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	much	more	efficient	:	 conserv 	 e 	 	,	 re 	 cycle 	 	,	etc	.
let	me	just	rush	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	through	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	.

i	'll	be	 focus 	 ing 	 	on	the	air	here	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	solar	-	powered	 air 	 plane 	 	--	165	 mile 	 s 	 	 carry 	 ing 	 	a	person	from	france	to	england	 a 	 s 	 	a	symbol	that	solar	power	is	going	to	be	an	 import 	 ant 	 	part	of	our	future	.	then	we	did	the	solar	car	for	general	 motor 	 s 	 	--	the	sunracer	--	that	won	the	race	in	australia	.
we	got	a	lot	of	people	 think 	 ing 	 	about	electric	 car 	 s 	 	,	what	you	could	do	with	them	.	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	when	we	 suggest 	 ed 	 	to	gm	that	now	is	the	time	and	we	could	do	a	thing	 call 	 ed 	 	the	impact	,	they	 sponsor 	 ed 	 	it	,	and	here	's	the	impact	that	we	 develop 	 ed 	 	with	them	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 program 	 s 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 demonst 	 rator 	 	.	and	they	put	huge	effort	 in 	 to 	 	 turn 	 ing 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	commercial	product	.
with	that	 pre 	 am 	 ble 	 	,	let	's	show	the	first	two	-	minute	 video 	 tape 	 	,	which	 show 	 s 	 	a	little	 air 	 plane 	 	for	 sur 	 veil 	 lance 	 	and	moving	to	a	giant	 air 	 plane 	 	.

if	 th 	 is 	 	 hit 	 s 	 	you	,	it	will	not	hurt	you	.
ok	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.	thank	you	.
but	now	,	 a 	 s 	 	they	say	in	 infomercial 	 s 	 	,	we	have	 some 	 thing 	 	much	better	for	you	,	which	we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	on	:	 plane 	 s 	 	that	are	 on 	 ly 	 	six	 inch 	 es 	 	--	15	 centimeter 	 s 	 	--	in	 s 	 ize 	 	.
and	matt	's	plane	was	on	the	cover	of	popular	science	last	month	,	 show 	 ing 	 	what	 th 	 is 	 	can	lead	to	.	and	in	a	while	,	 some 	 thing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 ize 	 	will	have	gps	and	a	video	camera	in	it	.	we	've	had	one	of	these	fly	nine	 mile 	 s 	 	through	the	air	at	35	 mile 	 s 	 	an	hour	with	just	a	little	 batt 	 ery 	 	in	it	.
but	there	's	a	lot	of	technology	going	.
there	are	just	 mile 	 stone 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	the	way	of	some	 remark 	 able 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	one	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	the	video	in	it	,	but	you	get	a	little	feel	from	what	it	can	do	.
ok	,	here	we	go	.	mk	:	sorry	.
ok	.
pm	:	if	you	can	pass	it	down	when	you	're	 d 	 one 	 	.	 yea 	 h 	 	,	i	think	--	i	lost	a	little	 orient 	 ation 	 	;	i	 look 	 ed 	 	up	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	light	.	it	hit	the	building	.	and	the	building	was	 poor 	 ly 	 	 place 	 d 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
but	you	're	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	see	what	can	be	 d 	 one 	 	.
we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 project 	 s 	 	now	--	even	wing	-	flapping	 thing 	 s 	 	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	hawk	 moth 	 s 	 	--	darpa	 contract 	 s 	 	,	 work 	 ing 	 	with	caltech	,	ucla	.
where	all	 th 	 is 	 	 lead 	 s 	 	,	i	do	n't	know	.	is	it	practical	?	i	do	n't	know	.
but	like	any	 bas 	 ic 	 	research	,	when	you	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 force 	 d 	 	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	way	beyond	 exist 	 ing 	 	technology	,	you	can	get	there	with	micro	-	technology	,	 nano 	 technology 	 	.
you	can	do	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	when	you	 real 	 ize 	 	what	nature	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	all	 a 	 long 	 	.	 a 	 s 	 	you	get	to	these	small	 scale 	 s 	 	,	you	 real 	 ize 	 	we	have	a	lot	to	learn	from	nature	--	not	with	747s	--	but	when	you	get	down	to	the	nature	's	realm	,	nature	 ha 	 s 	 	200	million	 year 	 s 	 	of	experience	.	it	never	 make 	 s 	 	a	 mistak 	 e 	 	.	 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	make	a	 mistak 	 e 	 	,	you	do	n't	 leav 	 e 	 	any	 pro 	 geny 	 	.
we	should	have	 noth 	 ing 	 	but	success	 st 	 ories 	 	from	nature	,	for	you	or	for	 bird 	 s 	 	,	and	we	're	 learn 	 ing 	 	a	lot	from	 it 	 s 	 	 fasci 	 nating 	 	 subject 	 s 	 	.
in	 con 	 clud 	 ing 	 	,	i	want	to	get	back	to	the	big	picture	and	i	have	just	two	final	 slide 	 s 	 	to	try	and	put	it	in	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	.
the	first	i	'll	just	read	.	at	last	,	i	put	in	three	 sentence 	 s 	 	and	had	it	say	what	i	 want 	 ed 	 	.
over	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	on	a	 un 	 ique 	 	sphere	,	chance	 ha 	 s 	 	 paint 	 ed 	 	a	thin	 cover 	 ing 	 	of	life	--	complex	,	 im 	 prob 	 able 	 	,	 wonder 	 ful 	 	and	fragile	.	 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	we	 human 	 s 	 	--	a	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 arriv 	 ed 	 	species	,	no	 long 	 er 	 	subject	to	the	 check 	 s 	 	and	 balance 	 s 	 	inherent	in	nature	--	have	grown	in	population	,	technology	and	 intellig 	 ence 	 	to	a	position	of	 terr 	 ible 	 	power	.	we	now	wield	the	 paint 	 brush 	 	.	and	that	's	serious	:	we	're	not	 ver 	 y 	 	bright	.	we	're	short	on	 wis 	 dom 	 	;	we	're	high	on	technology	.	where	's	it	going	to	lead	?
well	,	inspired	by	the	 sentence 	 s 	 	,	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	wield	the	 paint 	 brush 	 	.
every	25	 year 	 s 	 	i	do	a	picture	.	here	's	the	one	--	tries	to	show	that	the	world	is	n't	 get 	 ting 	 	any	 big 	 ger 	 	.
sort	of	a	 time 	 line 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	non	-	linear	scale	,	nature	rates	and	 tri 	 lob 	 ites 	 	and	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	,	and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	we	saw	some	 human 	 s 	 	with	 cave 	 s 	 	...	 bird 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 fly 	 ing 	 	 over 	 head 	 	,	after	 pterosaur 	 s 	 	.
and	then	we	get	to	the	 civil 	 ization 	 	above	the	little	tv	set	with	a	gun	on	it	.	then	traffic	 jam 	 s 	 	,	and	power	 system 	 s 	 	,	and	some	 dot 	 s 	 	for	digital	.	where	it	's	going	to	lead	--	i	have	no	idea	.
and	so	i	just	put	robotic	and	natural	 cock 	 roach 	 es 	 	out	there	,	but	you	can	fill	in	 what 	 ever 	 	you	want	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	 fore 	 cast 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 war 	 ning 	 	,	and	we	have	to	think	 serious 	 ly 	 	about	it	.
and	that	time	when	 th 	 is 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	is	not	100	 year 	 s 	 	or	500	 year 	 s 	 	.
 thing 	 s 	 	are	going	on	 th 	 is 	 	decade	,	next	decade	;
it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	short	time	that	we	have	to	decide	what	we	are	going	to	do	.
and	if	we	can	get	some	 agree 	 ment 	 	on	where	we	want	the	world	to	be	--	 desir 	 able 	 	,	 sustain 	 able 	 	when	your	 kid 	 s 	 	reach	your	age	--	i	think	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	can	reach	it	.	now	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	 war 	 ning 	 	,	not	a	 fore 	 cast 	 	.	that	was	before	--	i	 paint 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	before	we	 start 	 ed 	 	in	on	making	robotic	 version 	 s 	 	of	hawk	 moth 	 s 	 	and	 cock 	 roach 	 es 	 	,	and	now	i	'm	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	wonder	 serious 	 ly 	 	--	was	 th 	 is 	 	more	of	a	 fore 	 cast 	 	than	i	 want 	 ed 	 	?
i	 personal 	 ly 	 	think	the	 surviv 	 ing 	 	intelligent	life	form	on	earth	is	not	going	to	be	carbon	-	based	;	it	's	going	to	be	silicon	-	based	.
and	so	where	it	all	 go 	 es 	 	,	i	do	n't	know	.
the	one	final	bit	of	 spark 	 le 	 	we	'll	put	in	at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	end	here	is	an	 utter 	 ly 	 	 im 	 practical 	 	flight	vehicle	,	which	is	a	little	ornithopter	wing	-	flapping	 de 	 vice 	 	that	--	rubber	-	band	powered	--	that	we	'll	show	you	.
mk	:	32	gram	.	sorry	,	one	gram	.
pm	:	last	night	we	 g 	 ave 	 	it	a	few	too	 man 	 y 	 	 turn 	 s 	 	and	it	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	bash	the	roof	out	 al 	 so 	 	.	it	's	about	a	gram	.
the	tube	there	's	hollow	,	about	paper	-	thin	.
and	if	 th 	 is 	 	 land 	 s 	 	on	you	,	i	assure	you	it	will	not	hurt	you	.
but	if	you	reach	out	to	grab	it	or	hold	it	,	you	will	destroy	it	.
so	,	be	gentle	,	just	act	like	a	 wood 	 en 	 	indian	or	 some 	 thing 	 	.
and	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	down	--	and	we	'll	see	how	it	 go 	 es 	 	.
we	consider	 th 	 is 	 	to	be	sort	of	the	spirit	of	ted	.
and	you	wonder	,	is	it	practical	?	and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	if	i	had	not	 be 	 en 	 	--	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	we	have	some	light	bulb	 change 	 s 	 	.
we	can	 prob 	 ably 	 	get	it	down	,	but	it	's	possible	it	's	gone	up	to	a	 great 	 er 	 	 de 	 s 	 tin 	 y 	 	up	there	--	--	than	it	ever	had	.	and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	make	--	just	--	but	i	want	to	make	just	two	 point 	 s 	 	.	one	is	,	you	think	it	's	frivolous	;	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	it	.	and	yet	if	i	had	not	 be 	 en 	 	making	 ornithopter 	 s 	 	like	that	,	a	little	bit	cruder	,	in	1939	--	a	long	,	long	time	ago	--	there	would	n't	have	 be 	 en 	 	a	gossamer	condor	,	there	would	n't	have	 be 	 en 	 	an	 al 	 batross 	 	,	a	solar	challenger	,	there	would	n't	be	an	impact	car	,	there	would	n't	be	a	 man 	 date 	 	on	zero	-	 e 	 mission 	 	 vehicle 	 s 	 	in	california	.
a	lot	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	--	or	similar	--	would	have	 happen 	 ed 	 	some	time	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	a	decade	 lat 	 er 	 	.	i	did	n't	 real 	 ize 	 	at	the	time	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	 inquir 	 y 	 	-	based	,	 hand 	 s 	 	-	on	 thing 	 s 	 	with	 team 	 s 	 	,	like	they	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	in	education	 system 	 s 	 	.
so	i	think	that	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	symbol	,	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	.
and	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 al 	 so 	 	is	 import 	 ant 	 	.	you	can	think	of	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	sort	of	a	symbol	for	 learn 	 ing 	 	and	ted	that	 some 	 how 	 	 get 	 s 	 	you	 think 	 ing 	 	of	technology	and	nature	,	and	 put 	 s 	 	it	all	together	in	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	--	that	make	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	,	i	think	,	more	 import 	 ant 	 	than	any	that	's	taken	place	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	in	 th 	 is 	 	decade	.
thank	you	.
