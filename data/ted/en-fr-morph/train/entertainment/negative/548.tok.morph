i	'll	tell	you	a	little	bit	about	irrational	behavior	.
not	 your 	 s 	 	,	of	course	--	other	people	's	.
so	after	 be 	 ing 	 	at	mit	for	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	writing	academic	 paper 	 s 	 	is	not	that	 excit 	 ing 	 	.
you	know	,	i	do	n't	know	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	you	read	,
but	it	's	not	 f 	 un 	 	to	read	and	often	not	 f 	 un 	 	to	write	--
even	 wo 	 rse 	 	to	write	.
so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	try	and	write	 some 	 thing 	 	more	 f 	 un 	 	.
and	i	came	up	with	an	idea	that	i	will	write	a	 cook 	 book 	 	.
and	the	title	for	my	 cook 	 book 	 	was	going	to	be	``	 din 	 ing 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 crumb 	 s 	 	:	the	art	of	eating	over	the	sink	.	``
and	it	was	going	to	be	a	look	at	life	through	the	kitchen	.
and	i	was	 quit 	 e 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.	i	was	going	to	talk	a	little	bit	about	research	,	a	little	bit	about	the	kitchen	.
you	know	,	we	do	so	much	in	the	kitchen	i	thought	 th 	 is 	 	would	be	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	wrote	a	couple	of	 chapter 	 s 	 	.
and	i	took	it	to	mit	press	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	cute	,	but	not	for	us	.	go	and	find	 some 	 body 	 	else	.	``
i	 tri 	 ed 	 	other	people	and	 every 	 body 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	the	same	thing	,	``	cute	.	not	for	us	.	``
 un 	 til 	 	 some 	 body 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	look	,	if	you	're	serious	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	first	have	to	write	a	book	about	your	research	.	you	have	to	publish	 some 	 thing 	 	,
and	then	you	'll	get	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	write	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
if	you	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	do	it	you	have	to	do	it	.	``
so	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	,	i	 re 	 ally 	 	do	n't	want	to	write	about	my	research	.
i	do	 th 	 is 	 	all	day	long	.	i	want	to	write	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
 some 	 thing 	 	a	bit	more	free	,	less	 con 	 s 	 trained 	 	.	``
and	 th 	 is 	 	person	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 force 	 ful 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	look	.	that	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	you	'll	ever	do	it	.	``
so	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	if	i	have	to	do	it	--	``	i	had	a	sabbatical	.	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'll	write	about	my	research	if	there	is	no	other	way	.	and	then	i	'll	get	to	do	my	 cook 	 book 	 	.	``
so	i	wrote	a	book	on	my	research	.
and	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	 quit 	 e 	 	 f 	 un 	 	in	two	ways	.
first	of	all	,	i	 enjoy 	 ed 	 	writing	.
but	the	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	was	that	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	from	people	.
it	's	a	fantastic	time	to	write	,
 be 	 cause 	 	there	is	so	much	 feed 	 back 	 	you	can	get	from	people	.
people	write	me	about	 the 	 ir 	 	personal	experience	,	and	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	,	and	what	they	disagree	,	and	 nuance 	 s 	 	.
and	even	 be 	 ing 	 	here	--	i	mean	the	last	few	 day 	 s 	 	,	i	've	known	 re 	 ally 	 	 height 	 s 	 	of	 obsess 	 ive 	 	behavior	i	never	thought	about	.
which	i	think	is	just	 fasci 	 nating 	 	.
i	will	tell	you	a	little	bit	about	irrational	behavior	.
and	i	want	to	start	by	giving	you	some	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	visual	illusion	 a 	 s 	 	a	metaphor	for	 rational 	 ity 	 	.
so	think	about	these	two	 table 	 s 	 	.
and	you	must	have	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	illusion	.
if	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	you	what	's	 long 	 er 	 	,	the	 vert 	 ical 	 	line	on	the	table	on	the	left	,	or	the	 horizon 	 tal 	 	line	on	the	table	on	the	right	?
which	one	 seem 	 s 	 	 long 	 er 	 	?
can	 any 	 body 	 	see	 any 	 thing 	 	but	the	left	one	 be 	 ing 	 	 long 	 er 	 	?
no	,	right	?	it	's	 im 	 possible 	 	.
but	the	nice	thing	about	visual	illusion	is	we	can	 eas 	 ily 	 	 demonst 	 rate 	 	 mistak 	 es 	 	.
so	i	can	put	some	lines	on	;	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	help	.
i	can	animate	the	lines	.	and	to	the	 ex 	 tent 	 	you	 believ 	 e 	 	i	did	n't	shrink	the	lines	,	which	i	did	n't	,	i	've	proven	to	you	that	your	 eye 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 de 	 ceiv 	 ing 	 	you	.
now	,	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	when	i	take	the	lines	away	,	it	's	 a 	 s 	 	if	you	have	n't	 learn 	 ed 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	in	the	last	minute	.
you	ca	n't	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	and	say	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	now	i	see	 re 	 ality 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	.	``
right	?	it	's	 im 	 possible 	 	to	 over 	 come 	 	 th 	 is 	 	sense	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	 long 	 er 	 	.
our	 intuit 	 ion 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 fool 	 ing 	 	us	in	a	 repeat 	 able 	 	,	 predict 	 able 	 	,	 consist 	 ent 	 	way	.
and	there	is	 al 	 most 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	we	can	do	about	it	,	 a 	 side 	 	from	taking	a	 rul 	 er 	 	and	 start 	 ing 	 	to	measure	it	.
here	is	 an 	 other 	 	one	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 illusion 	 s 	 	.
what	do	you	see	the	color	that	top	arrow	is	 point 	 ing 	 	to	?
 brow 	 n 	 	.	thank	you	.
the	bottom	one	?	yellow	.
 turn 	 s 	 	out	they	're	 ident 	 ical 	 	.
can	 any 	 body 	 	see	them	 a 	 s 	 	 ident 	 ical 	 	?
 ver 	 y 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	.
i	can	cover	the	rest	of	the	cube	up	.	and	if	i	cover	the	rest	of	the	cube	you	can	see	that	they	are	 ident 	 ical 	 	.
and	if	you	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	me	you	can	get	the	slide	 lat 	 er 	 	and	do	some	 art 	 s 	 	and	 craft 	 s 	 	and	see	that	they	're	 ident 	 ical 	 	.
but	 aga 	 in 	 	it	's	the	same	story	that	if	we	take	the	 back 	 ground 	 	away	,	the	illusion	 come 	 s 	 	back	.	right	.
there	is	no	way	for	us	not	to	see	 th 	 is 	 	illusion	.
i	guess	 may 	 be 	 	if	you	're	 color 	 blind 	 	i	do	n't	think	you	can	see	that	.
i	want	you	to	think	about	illusion	 a 	 s 	 	a	metaphor	.
vision	is	one	of	the	best	 thing 	 s 	 	we	do	.
we	have	a	huge	part	of	our	brain	 dedicate 	 d 	 	to	vision	--	 big 	 ger 	 	than	 dedicate 	 d 	 	to	 any 	 thing 	 	else	.
we	do	more	vision	more	 hour 	 s 	 	of	the	day	than	we	do	 any 	 thing 	 	else	.
and	we	are	 evolution 	 arily 	 	designed	to	do	vision	.
and	if	we	have	these	 predict 	 able 	 	 repeat 	 able 	 	 mistak 	 es 	 	in	vision	,	which	we	're	so	good	at	,	what	's	the	chance	that	we	do	n't	make	even	more	 mistak 	 es 	 	in	 some 	 thing 	 	we	're	not	 a 	 s 	 	good	at	--
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	financial	decision	making	:
 some 	 thing 	 	we	do	n't	have	an	 evolution 	 ary 	 	reason	to	do	,	we	do	n't	have	a	 special 	 ized 	 	part	of	the	brain	,	and	we	do	n't	do	that	 man 	 y 	 	 hour 	 s 	 	of	the	day	.
and	the	argument	is	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 case 	 s 	 	it	might	be	the	issue	that	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	make	 man 	 y 	 	more	 mistak 	 es 	 
and	,	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	not	have	an	easy	way	to	see	them	.
 be 	 cause 	 	in	visual	 illusion 	 s 	 	we	can	 eas 	 ily 	 	 demonst 	 rate 	 	the	 mistak 	 es 	 	;
in	cognitive	illusion	it	's	much	,	much	 hard 	 er 	 	to	 demonst 	 rate 	 	to	people	the	 mistak 	 es 	 	.
so	i	want	to	show	you	some	cognitive	 illusion 	 s 	 	,	or	decision	-	making	 illusion 	 s 	 	,	in	the	same	way	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 plot 	 s 	 	in	social	 science 	 s 	 	.
it	's	from	a	paper	by	johnson	and	goldstein	.
and	it	 bas 	 ically 	 	 show 	 s 	 	the	 percent 	 age 	 	of	people	who	 indic 	 ated 	 	they	would	be	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	giving	 the 	 ir 	 	 organ 	 s 	 	to	 don 	 ation 	 	.
and	these	are	different	 count 	 ries 	 	in	europe	.	and	you	 bas 	 ically 	 	see	two	 type 	 s 	 	of	 count 	 ries 	 	:
 count 	 ries 	 	on	the	right	,	that	seem	to	be	giving	a	lot	;	and	 count 	 ries 	 	on	the	left	that	seem	to	giving	 ver 	 y 	 	little	,	or	much	less	.
the	question	is	,	why	?	why	do	some	 count 	 ries 	 	give	a	lot	and	some	 count 	 ries 	 	give	a	little	?
when	you	ask	people	 th 	 is 	 	question	,	they	 usual 	 ly 	 	think	that	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 some 	 thing 	 	about	culture	.
right	?	how	much	do	you	care	about	people	?
giving	your	 organ 	 s 	 	to	 some 	 body 	 	else	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	about	how	much	you	care	about	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	how	linked	you	are	.
or	 may 	 be 	 	it	is	about	 relig 	 ion 	 	.
but	,	if	you	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	plot	,	you	can	see	that	 count 	 ries 	 	that	we	think	about	 a 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	 actual 	 ly 	 	exhibit	 ver 	 y 	 	different	behavior	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	sweden	is	all	the	way	on	the	right	,	and	denmark	,	that	we	think	is	 cultural 	 ly 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	,	is	all	the	way	on	the	left	.
germany	is	on	the	left	.	and	austria	is	on	the	right	.
the	netherlands	is	on	the	left	.	and	belgium	is	on	the	right	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	your	 part 	 icular 	 	version	of	european	 similar 	 ity 	 	,	you	can	think	about	the	u.	k	and	france	 a 	 s 	 	either	similar	 cultural 	 ly 	 	or	not	.
but	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	from	organ	 don 	 ation 	 	they	are	 ver 	 y 	 	different	.
by	the	way	,	the	netherlands	is	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	story	.
you	see	the	netherlands	is	kind	of	the	 big 	 gest 	 	of	the	small	group	.
 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	they	got	to	28	percent	after	 mail 	 ing 	 	every	 house 	 hold 	 	in	the	country	a	letter	 beg 	 ging 	 	people	to	join	 th 	 is 	 	organ	 don 	 ation 	 	program	.
you	know	the	 express 	 ion 	 	,	``	 beg 	 ging 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 get 	 s 	 	you	so	far	``	?
it	's	28	percent	in	organ	 don 	 ation 	 	.
but	 what 	 ever 	 	the	 count 	 ries 	 	on	the	right	are	 do 	 ing 	 	they	are	 do 	 ing 	 	a	much	better	job	than	 beg 	 ging 	 	.
so	what	are	they	 do 	 ing 	 	?
 turn 	 s 	 	out	the	secret	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	with	a	form	at	the	dmv	.
and	here	is	the	story	.	the	 count 	 ries 	 	on	the	left	have	a	form	at	the	dmv	that	 look 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.	check	the	box	 be 	 low 	 	if	you	want	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	in	the	organ	donor	program	.
and	what	 happen 	 s 	 	?
people	do	n't	check	,	and	they	do	n't	join	.
the	 count 	 ries 	 	on	the	right	,	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	give	a	lot	,	have	a	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	different	form	.
it	 say 	 s 	 	check	the	box	 be 	 low 	 	if	you	do	n't	want	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	.
 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	when	people	get	 th 	 is 	 	,	they	 aga 	 in 	 	do	n't	check	--	but	now	they	join	.
now	think	about	what	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	.
we	wake	up	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	and	we	feel	we	make	 decision 	 s 	 	.
we	wake	up	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	and	we	open	the	 close 	 t 	 
and	we	feel	that	we	decide	what	to	wear	.
and	we	open	the	 refrige 	 rator 	 	and	we	feel	that	we	decide	what	to	eat	.
what	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	is	that	much	of	these	 decision 	 s 	 	are	not	 re 	 sid 	 ing 	 	 with 	 in 	 	us	.
they	are	 re 	 sid 	 ing 	 	in	the	person	who	is	 design 	 ing 	 	that	form	.
when	you	walk	 in 	 to 	 	the	dmv	,	the	person	who	designed	the	form	will	have	a	huge	influence	on	what	you	'll	end	up	 do 	 ing 	 	.
now	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	intuit	these	 result 	 s 	 	.	think	about	it	for	 your 	 self 	 	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	 believ 	 e 	 	that	if	you	went	to	renew	your	 licens 	 e 	 	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	,	and	you	went	to	the	dmv	,	and	you	would	 en 	 counter 	 	one	of	these	 form 	 s 	 	,	that	it	would	 actual 	 ly 	 	change	your	own	behavior	?
 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	think	that	you	will	influence	us	.
we	can	say	,	``	oh	,	these	funny	europeans	,	of	course	it	would	influence	them	.	``
but	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	us	,	we	have	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 feel 	 ing 	 	that	we	are	at	the	driver	's	seat	,	we	have	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 feel 	 ing 	 	that	we	are	in	control	,	and	we	are	making	the	decision	,	that	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	even	accept	the	idea	that	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	an	illusion	of	making	a	decision	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	an	actual	decision	.
now	,	you	might	say	,	``	these	are	 decision 	 s 	 	we	do	n't	care	about	.	``
in	fact	,	by	definition	,	these	are	 decision 	 s 	 	about	 some 	 thing 	 	that	will	happen	to	us	after	we	die	.
how	could	we	care	about	 some 	 thing 	 	less	than	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 happen 	 s 	 	after	we	die	?
so	a	standard	economist	,	 some 	 one 	 	who	 believ 	 es 	 	in	 rational 	 ity 	 	,	would	say	,	``	you	know	what	?	the	cost	of	 lift 	 ing 	 	the	pencil	and	 mark 	 ing 	 	a	v	is	 high 	 er 	 	than	the	possible	benefit	of	the	decision	,
so	that	's	why	we	get	 th 	 is 	 	effect	.	``
but	,	in	fact	,	it	's	not	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	easy	.
it	's	not	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	trivial	.	it	's	not	 be 	 cause 	 	we	do	n't	care	.
it	's	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	.	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	we	care	.
it	's	difficult	and	it	's	complex	.	and	it	's	so	complex	that	we	do	n't	know	what	to	do	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	no	idea	what	to	do	we	just	pick	 what 	 ever 	 	it	was	that	was	 chose 	 n 	 	for	us	.
i	'll	give	you	one	more	 ex 	 ample 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	from	a	paper	by	redelmeier	and	schaefer	.
and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	 th 	 is 	 	effect	 al 	 so 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	to	 expert 	 s 	 	,	people	who	are	well	-	paid	,	 expert 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 decision 	 s 	 	,	do	it	a	lot	.	``
and	they	 bas 	 ically 	 	took	a	group	of	 physician 	 s 	 	.	and	they	 present 	 ed 	 	to	them	a	case	 stud 	 y 	 	of	a	patient	.
here	is	a	patient	.	he	is	a	67	-	year	-	old	 farm 	 er 	 	.
he	's	 be 	 en 	 	 suffer 	 ing 	 	from	a	right	hip	pain	for	a	while	.
and	then	they	 s 	 aid 	 	to	the	physician	,	``	you	 decide 	 d 	 	a	few	 week 	 s 	 	ago	that	 noth 	 ing 	 	is	 work 	 ing 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	patient	.
all	these	 medic 	 ations 	 	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	 work 	 ing 	 	.
so	you	refer	the	patient	to	hip	 re 	 placement 	 	therapy	.
hip	 re 	 placement 	 	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?	``
so	the	patient	is	on	a	path	to	have	his	hip	 replace 	 d 	 	.
and	then	they	 s 	 aid 	 	to	half	the	 physician 	 s 	 	,	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 yester 	 day 	 	you	 review 	 ed 	 	the	patient	's	case	and	you	 real 	 ized 	 	that	you	 for 	 got 	 	to	try	one	 medic 	 ation 	 	.
you	did	not	try	ibuprofen	.
what	do	you	do	?	do	you	pull	the	patient	back	and	try	ibuprofen	?
or	do	you	let	them	go	and	have	hip	 re 	 placement 	 	?	``
well	the	good	news	is	that	most	 physician 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	 decide 	 d 	 	to	pull	the	patient	and	try	the	ibuprofen	.
 ver 	 y 	 	good	for	the	 physician 	 s 	 	.
the	other	group	of	the	 physician 	 s 	 	,	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 yester 	 day 	 	when	you	 review 	 ed 	 	the	case	you	 discover 	 ed 	 	there	 we 	 re 	 	two	 medic 	 ations 	 	you	did	n't	try	out	yet	,	ibuprofen	and	piroxicam	.	``
and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	have	two	 medic 	 ations 	 	you	did	n't	try	out	yet	.	what	do	you	do	?
you	let	them	go	.	or	you	pull	them	back	.
and	if	you	pull	them	back	do	you	try	ibuprofen	or	piroxicam	?	which	one	?	``
now	think	of	it	.	 th 	 is 	 	decision	 make 	 s 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	easy	to	let	the	patient	 continu 	 e 	 	with	hip	 re 	 placement 	 	.	but	 pull 	 ing 	 	them	back	,	all	of	the	sudden	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	more	complex	.
there	is	one	more	decision	.
what	 happen 	 s 	 	now	?
 major 	 ity 	 	of	the	 physician 	 s 	 	now	 choos 	 e 	 	to	let	the	patient	go	to	hip	 re 	 placement 	 	.
i	hope	 th 	 is 	 	 worri 	 es 	 	you	,	by	the	way	--	when	you	go	to	see	your	physician	.
the	thing	is	is	that	no	physician	would	ever	say	,	``	piroxicam	,	ibuprofen	,	hip	 re 	 placement 	 	.
let	's	go	for	hip	 re 	 placement 	 	.	``
but	the	moment	you	set	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	default	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	huge	power	over	 what 	 ever 	 	people	end	up	 do 	 ing 	 	.
i	'll	give	you	a	couple	of	more	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	on	irrational	decision	-	making	.
imagine	i	give	you	a	choice	.	do	you	want	to	go	for	a	 week 	 end 	 	to	rome	?
all	 expense 	 s 	 	paid	:	hotel	,	 transport 	 ation 	 	,	food	,	 break 	 fast 	 	,	a	 continent 	 al 	 	 break 	 fast 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	.
or	a	 week 	 end 	 	in	paris	?
now	,	a	 week 	 end 	 	in	paris	,	a	 week 	 end 	 	in	rome	,	these	are	different	 thing 	 s 	 	;
they	have	different	food	,	different	culture	,	different	art	.
now	imagine	i	 add 	 ed 	 	a	choice	to	the	set	that	 no 	 body 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	.
imagine	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	a	 week 	 end 	 	in	rome	,	a	 week 	 end 	 	in	paris	,	or	 hav 	 ing 	 	your	car	 stole 	 n 	 	?	``
it	's	a	funny	idea	,	 be 	 cause 	 	why	would	 hav 	 ing 	 	your	car	 stole 	 n 	 	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	set	,	influence	 any 	 thing 	 	?
but	what	if	the	option	to	have	your	car	 stole 	 n 	 	was	not	 exact 	 ly 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
what	if	it	was	a	trip	to	rome	,	all	 expense 	 s 	 	paid	,	 transport 	 ation 	 	,	 break 	 fast 	 	,	but	 do 	 es 	 	n't	include	coffee	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
if	you	want	coffee	you	have	to	pay	for	it	 your 	 self 	 	.	it	's	two	 eur 	 os 	 	50	.
now	in	some	ways	,	 give 	 n 	 	that	you	can	have	rome	with	coffee	,	why	would	you	possibly	want	rome	 with 	 out 	 	coffee	?
it	's	like	 hav 	 ing 	 	your	car	 stole 	 n 	 	.	it	's	an	 infer 	 ior 	 	option	.
but	guess	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	.	the	moment	you	add	rome	 with 	 out 	 	coffee	,	rome	with	coffee	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	more	popular	.	and	people	 choos 	 e 	 	it	.
the	fact	that	you	have	rome	 with 	 out 	 	coffee	 make 	 s 	 	rome	with	coffee	look	 super 	 ior 	 	,
and	not	just	to	rome	 with 	 out 	 	coffee	--	even	 super 	 ior 	 	to	paris	.
here	are	two	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	principle	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	an	ad	from	the	economist	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	that	 g 	 ave 	 	us	three	 choice 	 s 	 	.	an	 on 	 line 	 	subscription	for	59	 dollar 	 s 	 	.	a	print	subscription	for	_UNK_	or	you	could	get	both	for	125	.
now	i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	and	i	 call 	 ed 	 	up	the	economist	.
and	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	figure	out	what	 we 	 re 	 	they	 think 	 ing 	 	.
and	they	 pass 	 ed 	 	me	from	one	person	to	 an 	 other 	 	to	 an 	 other 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	i	got	to	a	person	who	was	in	charge	of	the	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
and	i	 call 	 ed 	 	them	up	.	and	they	went	to	check	what	was	going	on	.
the	next	thing	i	know	,	the	ad	is	gone	.	and	no	 explan 	 ation 	 	.
so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	do	the	experiment	that	i	would	have	 love 	 d 	 	the	economist	to	do	with	me	.
i	took	 th 	 is 	 	and	i	 g 	 ave 	 	it	to	100	mit	 student 	 s 	 	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	would	you	 choos 	 e 	 	?	``
these	are	the	market	share	.	most	people	 want 	 ed 	 	the	 com 	 bo 	 	deal	.
 thank 	 fully 	 	 no 	 body 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	the	 dominate 	 d 	 	option	.	that	 mean 	 s 	 	our	 student 	 s 	 	can	read	.
but	now	if	you	have	an	option	that	 no 	 body 	 	 want 	 s 	 	,	you	can	take	it	off	.	right	?
so	i	 print 	 ed 	 	 an 	 other 	 	version	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	where	i	 eliminate 	 d 	 	the	middle	option	.
i	 g 	 ave 	 	it	to	 an 	 other 	 	100	 student 	 s 	 	.	here	is	what	 happen 	 s 	 	.
now	the	most	popular	option	 be 	 came 	 	the	 l 	 east 	 	popular	.	and	the	 l 	 east 	 	popular	 be 	 came 	 	the	most	popular	.
what	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	was	the	option	that	was	 use 	 less 	 	,	in	the	middle	,	was	 use 	 less 	 	in	the	sense	that	 no 	 body 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	it	.
but	it	was	n't	 use 	 less 	 	in	the	sense	that	it	 help 	 ed 	 	people	figure	out	what	they	 want 	 ed 	 	.
in	fact	,	 relat 	 ive 	 	to	the	option	in	the	middle	,	which	was	get	 on 	 ly 	 	the	print	for	125	,	the	print	and	web	for	125	 look 	 ed 	 	like	a	fantastic	deal	.	and	 a 	 s 	 	a	 con 	 sequence 	 	,	people	chose	it	.
the	general	idea	here	,	by	the	way	,	is	that	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	n't	know	our	 pre 	 ference 	 s 	 	that	well	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	we	do	n't	know	our	 pre 	 ference 	 s 	 	that	well	we	're	susceptible	to	all	of	these	 influence 	 s 	 	from	the	external	 force 	 s 	 	:
the	 default 	 s 	 	,	the	 part 	 icular 	 	 option 	 s 	 	that	are	 present 	 ed 	 	to	us	,	and	so	on	.
one	more	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	.	people	 believ 	 e 	 	that	when	we	deal	with	physical	 attract 	 ion 	 	,	we	see	 some 	 body 	 	,	and	we	know	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	we	like	them	or	not	,
 attract 	 ed 	 	or	not	.
which	is	why	we	have	these	four	-	minute	 date 	 s 	 	.
so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	experiment	with	people	.
i	'll	show	you	graphic	 image 	 s 	 	of	people	--	not	real	people	.	the	experiment	was	with	people	.
i	 show 	 ed 	 	some	people	a	picture	of	tom	,	and	a	picture	of	jerry	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	``	who	do	you	want	to	date	?	tom	or	jerry	?	``
but	for	half	the	people	i	 add 	 ed 	 	an	 ug 	 ly 	 	version	of	jerry	.
i	took	photoshop	and	i	made	jerry	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	less	 attract 	 ive 	 	.
the	other	people	,	i	 add 	 ed 	 	an	 ug 	 ly 	 	version	of	tom	.
and	the	question	was	,	will	 ug 	 ly 	 	jerry	and	 ug 	 ly 	 	tom	help	 the 	 ir 	 	 respect 	 ive 	 	,	more	 attract 	 ive 	 	 brother 	 s 	 	?
the	answer	was	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 y 	 es 	 	.
when	 ug 	 ly 	 	jerry	was	around	,	jerry	was	popular	.	when	 ug 	 ly 	 	tom	was	around	,	tom	was	popular	.
 th 	 is 	 	of	course	 ha 	 s 	 	two	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	 implic 	 ations 	 	for	life	in	general	.
if	you	ever	go	bar	 hop 	 ping 	 	,	who	do	you	want	to	take	with	you	?
you	want	a	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 ugli 	 er 	 	version	of	 your 	 self 	 	.
similar	.	similar	...	but	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 ugli 	 er 	 	.
the	second	point	,	or	course	,	is	that	if	 some 	 body 	 	else	 invit 	 es 	 	you	,	you	know	how	they	think	about	you	.
now	you	're	 get 	 ting 	 	it	.	what	is	the	general	point	?
the	general	point	is	that	when	we	think	about	 economic 	 s 	 	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	view	of	human	nature	.
``	what	a	piece	of	work	is	man	!	how	noble	in	reason	!	``
we	have	 th 	 is 	 	view	of	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	of	 other 	 s 	 	.
the	 behavior 	 al 	 	 economic 	 s 	 	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	is	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	less	 gen 	 er 	 ous 	 	to	people	.
in	fact	in	medical	 term 	 s 	 	,	that	's	our	view	.
but	there	is	a	silver	lining	.
the	silver	lining	is	,	i	think	,	kind	of	the	reason	that	 behavior 	 al 	 	 economic 	 s 	 	is	 interest 	 ing 	 	and	 excit 	 ing 	 	.
are	we	 super 	 man 	 	?	or	are	we	homer	simpson	?
when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	building	the	physical	world	,	we	kind	of	understand	our	 limit 	 ations 	 	.
we	build	 step 	 s 	 	.	and	we	build	these	 thing 	 s 	 	that	not	 every 	 body 	 	can	use	 obvious 	 ly 	 	.
we	understand	our	 limit 	 ations 	 	,	and	we	build	around	it	.
but	for	some	reason	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	the	mental	world	,	when	we	design	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 health 	 care 	 	and	 retire 	 ment 	 	and	 stock 	 market 	 s 	 	,	we	 some 	 how 	 	forget	the	idea	that	we	are	 limit 	 ed 	 	.
i	think	that	if	we	 under 	 stood 	 	our	cognitive	 limit 	 ations 	 	in	the	same	way	that	we	understand	our	physical	 limit 	 ations 	 	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	they	do	n't	 star 	 e 	 	us	in	the	face	in	the	same	way	,	we	could	design	a	better	world	.
and	that	,	i	think	,	is	the	hope	of	 th 	 is 	 	thing	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
