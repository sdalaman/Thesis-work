i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	fortunate	to	be	here	.
i	feel	so	fortunate	.	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	so	 impress 	 ed 	 	by	the	 kind 	 ness 	 	 express 	 ed 	 	to	me	.
i	 call 	 ed 	 	my	wife	leslie	,	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	,	there	's	so	 man 	 y 	 	good	people	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	so	much	good	.
it	 feel 	 s 	 	like	i	've	 land 	 ed 	 	in	a	 colon 	 y 	 	of	 angel 	 s 	 	.	``
it	's	a	true	 feel 	 ing 	 	.
but	let	me	get	to	the	talk	--	i	see	the	clock	is	running	.
i	'm	a	public	school	teacher	,	and	i	just	want	to	share	a	story	of	my	 super 	 intend 	 ent 	 	.	her	name	is	pam	moran	in	albemarle	 count 	 y 	 	,	virginia	,	the	 foot 	 hill 	 s 	 	of	the	blue	ridge	 mountain 	 s 	 	.
and	she	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	high	-	tech	 super 	 intend 	 ent 	 	.
she	uses	smart	 board 	 s 	 	,	she	 blog 	 s 	 	,	she	 tweet 	 s 	 	,	she	 do 	 es 	 	facebook	,	she	 do 	 es 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	high	-	tech	stuff	.
she	's	a	technology	 lead 	 er 	 	and	 instruct 	 ional 	 	 lead 	 er 	 	.
but	in	her	 off 	 ice 	 	,	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	old	 wood 	 en 	 	,	weather	-	worn	table	,	kitchen	table	--	 peel 	 ing 	 	green	paint	,	it	's	kind	of	 rick 	 ety 	 	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	pam	,	you	're	 s 	 uch 	 	a	modern	,	cutting	-	edge	person	.
why	is	 th 	 is 	 	old	table	in	your	 off 	 ice 	 	?	``
and	she	told	me	,	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	,	i	grew	up	in	southwestern	virginia	,	in	the	coal	 mine 	 s 	 	and	the	 farm 	 land 	 s 	 	of	 r 	 ural 	 	virginia	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	table	was	in	my	 grand 	 father 	 	's	kitchen	.
and	we	'd	come	in	from	 play 	 ing 	 	,	he	'd	come	in	from	 plow 	 ing 	 	and	 work 	 ing 	 	,	and	we	'd	 s 	 it 	 	around	that	table	every	night	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	grew	up	,	i	heard	so	much	knowledge	and	so	 man 	 y 	 	 in 	 sight 	 s 	 	and	so	much	 wis 	 dom 	 	come	out	around	 th 	 is 	 	table	,	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	call	it	the	 wis 	 dom 	 	table	.
and	when	he	 pass 	 ed 	 	on	,	i	took	 th 	 is 	 	table	with	me	and	 br 	 ought 	 	it	to	my	 off 	 ice 	 	,	and	it	 re 	 mind 	 s 	 	me	of	him	.
it	 re 	 mind 	 s 	 	me	of	what	 go 	 es 	 	on	around	an	empty	space	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	.	``
the	project	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	about	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	world	peace	game	,	and	 essential 	 ly 	 	it	is	 al 	 so 	 	an	empty	space	.
and	i	'd	like	to	think	of	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	21st	century	 wis 	 dom 	 	table	,	 re 	 ally 	 	.
it	all	 start 	 ed 	 	back	in	1977	.
i	was	a	young	man	,	and	i	had	 be 	 en 	 	dropping	in	and	out	of	college	.
and	my	 parent 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	patient	,	but	i	had	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	intermittent	sojourns	to	india	on	a	 mystic 	 al 	 	quest	.
and	i	remember	the	last	time	i	came	back	from	india	--	in	my	long	white	 flow 	 ing 	 	 robe 	 s 	 	and	my	big	beard	and	my	john	lennon	 glass 	 es 	 	--	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	to	my	father	,	``	dad	,	i	think	i	've	just	about	found	spiritual	 enlighten 	 ment 	 	.	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	there	's	one	more	thing	you	need	to	find	.	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	is	that	,	dad	?	``	``	a	job	.	``
and	so	they	 plead 	 ed 	 	with	me	to	get	a	degree	in	 some 	 thing 	 	.
so	i	got	a	degree	and	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	education	.
it	was	an	 experiment 	 al 	 	education	program	.
it	could	have	 be 	 en 	 	 dent 	 ist 	 ry 	 	,	but	the	word	``	 experiment 	 al 	 	``	was	in	it	,	and	so	that	's	what	i	had	to	go	for	.
and	i	went	in	for	a	job	interview	in	the	richmond	public	 school 	 s 	 	in	virginia	,	the	capital	city	,	 b 	 ought 	 	a	three	-	piece	suit	--	my	concession	to	convention	--	 ke 	 pt 	 	my	long	beard	and	my	afro	and	my	platform	 shoe 	 s 	 	--	at	the	time	it	was	the	'70s	--	and	i	 walk 	 ed 	 	in	,	and	i	 s 	 at 	 	down	and	had	an	interview	.
and	i	guess	they	 we 	 re 	 	hard	up	for	 teacher 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 super 	 visor 	 	,	her	name	was	anna	aro	,	 s 	 aid 	 	i	had	the	job	 teach 	 ing 	 	 gift 	 ed 	 	children	.
and	i	was	so	 shock 	 ed 	 	,	so	 stunn 	 ed 	 	,	i	got	up	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	thank	you	,	but	what	do	i	do	?	``
 gift 	 ed 	 	education	had	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	taken	hold	too	much	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 material 	 s 	 	or	 thing 	 s 	 	to	use	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	do	i	do	?	``
and	her	answer	 shock 	 ed 	 	me	.	it	 stunn 	 ed 	 	me	.
her	answer	set	the	template	for	the	entire	 care 	 er 	 	i	was	to	have	after	that	.
she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	do	you	want	to	do	?	``
and	that	question	 clear 	 ed 	 	the	space	.
there	was	no	program	 direct 	 ive 	 	,	no	manual	to	follow	,	no	 standard 	 s 	 	in	 gift 	 ed 	 	education	in	that	way	.
and	she	 clear 	 ed 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	a	space	that	i	 endeavor 	 ed 	 	from	then	on	to	clear	a	space	for	my	 student 	 s 	 	,	an	empty	space	,	 where 	 by 	 	they	could	create	and	make	meaning	out	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 understand 	 ing 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	1978	,	and	i	was	 teach 	 ing 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	and	a	friend	of	mine	 introduc 	 ed 	 	me	to	a	young	 film 	 maker 	 	.
his	name	is	chris	farina	.
chris	farina	is	here	 to 	 day 	 	at	his	own	cost	.
chris	,	could	you	stand	up	and	let	them	see	you	--	a	young	,	 vision 	 ary 	 	 film 	 maker 	 	who	's	made	a	film	.
 th 	 is 	 	film	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	world	peace	and	other	4th	grade	 achiev 	 ement 	 s 	 	.	``
he	 pro 	 posed 	 	the	film	to	me	--	it	's	a	great	title	.
he	 pro 	 posed 	 	the	film	to	me	,	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	it	'll	be	on	local	tv	,	and	we	can	say	hi	to	our	 friend 	 s 	 	.	``
but	the	film	 ha 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	gone	 place 	 s 	 	.
now	it	's	still	in	debt	,	but	chris	 ha 	 s 	 	 manage 	 d 	 	,	through	his	own	sacrifice	,	to	get	 th 	 is 	 	film	out	.
so	we	made	a	film	and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	be	more	than	a	story	about	me	,	more	than	a	story	about	one	teacher	.
it	's	a	story	that	's	a	 test 	 a 	 ment 	 	to	 teach 	 ing 	 	and	 teacher 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	thing	.
and	the	strange	thing	is	,	when	i	watch	the	film	--	i	have	the	 eer 	 ie 	 	 sens 	 ation 	 	of	 see 	 ing 	 	it	--	i	saw	 my 	 self 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	disappear	.
what	i	saw	was	my	 teacher 	 s 	 	coming	through	me	.
i	saw	my	 geo 	 metry 	 	teacher	in	high	school	,	mr.	rucell	's	wry	 s 	 mile 	 	under	his	 handle 	 bar 	 	 must 	 ache 	 	.
that	's	the	 s 	 mile 	 	i	use	--	that	's	his	 s 	 mile 	 	.
i	saw	jan	polo	's	 flash 	 ing 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	.
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 flash 	 ing 	 	in	anger	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 flash 	 ing 	 	in	love	,	 intens 	 e 	 	love	for	her	 student 	 s 	 	.
and	i	have	that	kind	of	flash	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	.
and	i	saw	 mis 	 s 	 	ethel	j.	 bank 	 s 	 	who	 wo 	 re 	 	 pearl 	 s 	 	and	high	-	 heel 	 s 	 	to	 element 	 ary 	 	school	every	day	.
and	you	know	,	she	had	that	old	-	school	teacher	 star 	 e 	 	.
you	know	the	one	.
``	and	i	'm	not	even	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	you	 be 	 hind 	 	me	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	've	got	 eye 	 s 	 	in	the	back	of	my	head	.	``
you	know	that	teacher	?
i	did	n't	use	that	 star 	 e 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	often	,	but	i	do	have	it	in	my	repertoire	.
and	 mis 	 s 	 	 bank 	 s 	 	was	there	 a 	 s 	 	a	great	mentor	for	me	.
and	then	i	saw	my	own	 parent 	 s 	 	,	my	first	 teacher 	 s 	 	.
my	father	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 invent 	 ive 	 	,	spatial	 think 	 er 	 	.
that	's	my	brother	malcolm	there	on	the	right	.
and	my	mother	,	who	taught	me	in	fourth	grade	in	 s 	 egreg 	 ated 	 	 school 	 s 	 	in	virginia	,	who	was	my	inspiration	.
and	 re 	 ally 	 	,	i	feel	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	,	when	i	see	the	film	--	i	have	a	 gest 	 ure 	 	she	 do 	 es 	 	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	--	i	feel	like	i	am	a	 continu 	 ation 	 	of	her	 gest 	 ure 	 	.
i	am	one	of	her	 teach 	 ing 	 	 gest 	 ures 	 	.
and	the	 beaut 	 iful 	 	thing	was	,	i	got	to	teach	my	daughter	in	 element 	 ary 	 	school	,	madeline	.
and	so	that	 gest 	 ure 	 	of	my	mother	's	 continu 	 es 	 	through	 man 	 y 	 	 generation 	 s 	 	.
it	's	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	to	have	that	 line 	 age 	 	.
and	so	i	'm	here	 stand 	 ing 	 	on	the	 shoulder 	 s 	 	of	 man 	 y 	 	people	.
i	'm	not	here	 al 	 one 	 	.
there	are	 man 	 y 	 	people	on	 th 	 is 	 	stage	right	now	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	world	peace	game	i	'd	like	to	tell	you	about	.
it	 start 	 ed 	 	out	like	 th 	 is 	 	:	it	's	just	a	four	-	foot	by	five	-	foot	 ply 	 wood 	 	board	in	an	inner	-	city	urban	school	,	1978	.
i	was	creating	a	 less 	 on 	 	for	 student 	 s 	 	on	africa	.
we	put	all	the	 problem 	 s 	 	of	the	world	there	,	and	i	thought	,	let	's	let	them	solve	it	.
i	did	n't	want	to	 lectur 	 e 	 	or	have	just	book	 read 	 ing 	 	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	have	them	be	 immers 	 ed 	 	and	learn	the	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	 learn 	 ing 	 	through	 the 	 ir 	 	bodies	.
so	i	thought	,	well	they	like	to	play	 game 	 s 	 	.	i	'll	make	 some 	 thing 	 	--	i	did	n't	say	 inter 	 active 	 	;	we	did	n't	have	that	term	in	1978	--	but	 some 	 thing 	 	 inter 	 active 	 	.
and	so	we	made	the	game	,	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	since	 evolv 	 ed 	 	to	a	four	-	foot	by	four	-	foot	by	four	-	foot	plexiglass	structure	.
and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	four	plexiglass	 layer 	 s 	 	.
there	's	an	 out 	 er 	 	space	layer	with	black	 hole 	 s 	 	and	 satellite 	 s 	 	and	research	 satellite 	 s 	 	and	 a 	 steroid 	 	 min 	 ing 	 	.
there	's	an	air	and	space	level	with	 cloud 	 s 	 	that	are	big	 puff 	 s 	 	of	cotton	we	push	around	and	 territ 	 orial 	 	air	 space 	 s 	 	and	air	 force 	 s 	 	,	a	ground	and	sea	level	with	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	game	 piece 	 s 	 	on	it	--	even	an	 under 	 sea 	 	level	with	 sub 	 marine 	 s 	 	and	 under 	 sea 	 	 min 	 ing 	 	.
there	are	four	 count 	 ries 	 	around	the	board	.
the	 kid 	 s 	 	make	up	the	 name 	 s 	 	of	the	 count 	 ries 	 	--	some	are	rich	;	some	are	poor	.
they	have	different	 asset 	 s 	 	,	commercial	and	 militar 	 y 	 	.
and	each	country	 ha 	 s 	 	a	cabinet	.
there	's	a	prime	 mini 	 ster 	 	,	 secret 	 ary 	 	of	state	,	 mini 	 ster 	 	of	defense	and	a	cfo	,	or	comptroller	.
i	 choos 	 e 	 	the	prime	 mini 	 ster 	 	based	on	my	relationship	with	them	.
i	 off 	 er 	 	them	the	job	,	they	can	turn	it	down	,	and	then	they	 choos 	 e 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	cabinet	.
there	's	a	world	bank	,	 arm 	 s 	 	 deal 	 ers 	 	and	a	 unit 	 ed 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	.
there	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	weather	goddess	who	 control 	 s 	 	a	random	stock	market	and	random	weather	.
that	's	not	all	.
and	then	there	's	a	13	-	page	crisis	document	with	50	 inter 	 lock 	 ing 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	.
so	that	,	if	one	thing	 change 	 s 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	else	 change 	 s 	 	.
i	throw	them	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	complex	 m 	 atrix 	 	,	and	they	trust	me	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	a	deep	,	rich	relationship	together	.
and	so	with	all	these	 cri 	 s 	 es 	 	,	we	have	--	let	's	see	--	ethnic	and	 minor 	 ity 	 	 tension 	 s 	 	;	we	have	chemical	and	nuclear	 s 	 pill 	 s 	 	,	nuclear	 pro 	 life 	 ration 	 	.	there	's	oil	 s 	 pill 	 s 	 	,	 environment 	 al 	 	 disaster 	 s 	 	,	water	 right 	 s 	 	 disput 	 es 	 	,	 break 	 away 	 	 re 	 public 	 s 	 	,	famine	,	 en 	 danger 	 ed 	 	species	and	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	.
if	al	gore	is	here	,	i	'm	going	to	 s 	 end 	 	my	fourth	-	graders	from	agnor	-	hurt	and	venable	 school 	 s 	 	to	you	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 solve 	 d 	 	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	in	a	week	.
and	they	've	 d 	 one 	 	it	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 time 	 s 	 	too	.
so	i	 al 	 so 	 	have	in	the	game	a	saboteur	--	some	child	--	it	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	a	 trouble 	 maker 	 	--	and	i	have	my	 trouble 	 maker 	 	put	to	use	 be 	 cause 	 	they	,	on	the	surface	,	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 s 	 ave 	 	the	world	and	 the 	 ir 	 	position	in	the	game	.
but	they	're	 al 	 so 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 under 	 mine 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	in	the	game	.
and	they	do	it	 secret 	 ly 	 	through	 mis 	 information 	 	and	 ambigu 	 ities 	 	and	 ir 	 r 	 elev 	 ancies 	 	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	cause	 every 	 one 	 	to	think	more	 deep 	 ly 	 	.
the	saboteur	is	there	,	and	we	 al 	 so 	 	read	from	 s 	 un 	 	tzu	's	``	the	art	of	war	.	``	fourth	-	graders	understand	it	--	nine	 year 	 s 	 	old	--	and	they	handle	that	and	use	that	to	understand	how	to	,	not	follow	--	at	first	they	do	--	the	 path 	 s 	 	to	power	and	 destruct 	 ion 	 	,	the	path	to	war	.
they	learn	to	overlook	short	-	 sight 	 ed 	 	 react 	 ions 	 	and	 im 	 puls 	 ive 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	,	to	think	in	a	long	-	term	,	more	 con 	 sequent 	 ial 	 	way	.
stewart	brand	is	here	,	and	one	of	the	 idea 	 s 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	game	came	from	him	with	a	 co 	 evolution 	 	 quarter 	 ly 	 	article	on	a	peace	force	.
and	in	the	game	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 student 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	form	a	peace	force	.
i	'm	just	a	clock	 watch 	 er 	 	.
i	'm	just	a	 clar 	 ifier 	 	.	i	'm	just	a	facilitator	.
the	 student 	 s 	 	run	the	game	.
i	have	no	chance	to	make	any	policy	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	once	they	start	 play 	 ing 	 	.
so	i	'll	just	share	with	you	...
boy	:	the	world	peace	game	is	serious	.
you	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	taught	 some 	 thing 	 	like	how	to	take	care	of	the	world	.
see	,	mr.	hunter	is	 do 	 ing 	 	that	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 say 	 s 	 	his	time	 ha 	 s 	 	 mess 	 ed 	 	up	a	lot	,	and	he	's	 try 	 ing 	 	to	tell	us	how	to	fix	that	problem	.
john	hunter	:	i	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	them	a	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	ca	n't	tell	them	 any 	 thing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	do	n't	know	the	answer	.
and	i	admit	the	truth	to	them	right	up	front	:	i	do	n't	know	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	i	do	n't	know	,	they	've	got	to	dig	up	the	answer	.
and	so	i	 apolog 	 ize 	 	to	them	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
i	say	,	``	i	'm	so	sorry	,	 boy 	 s 	 	and	 girl 	 s 	 	,	but	the	truth	is	we	have	left	 th 	 is 	 	world	to	you	in	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 s 	 ad 	 	and	 terr 	 ible 	 	shape	,	and	we	hope	you	can	fix	it	for	us	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	 th 	 is 	 	game	will	help	you	learn	how	to	do	it	.	``
it	's	a	 since 	 re 	 	 apolog 	 y 	 	,	and	they	take	it	 ver 	 y 	 	 serious 	 ly 	 	.
now	you	may	be	 wonder 	 ing 	 	what	all	 th 	 is 	 	 complex 	 ity 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
well	when	we	have	the	game	start	,	here	's	what	you	see	.
jh	:	all	right	,	we	're	going	 in 	 to 	 	 negoti 	 ations 	 	 a 	 s 	 	of	now	.	go	.
jh	:	my	question	to	you	is	,	who	's	in	charge	of	that	 class 	 room 	 	?
it	's	a	serious	question	:	who	is	 re 	 ally 	 	in	charge	?
i	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	to	cede	control	of	the	 class 	 room 	 	over	to	the	 student 	 s 	 	over	time	.
there	's	a	trust	and	an	 understand 	 ing 	 	and	a	 d 	 ed 	 ic 	 ation 	 	to	an	ideal	that	i	 simpl 	 y 	 	do	n't	have	to	do	what	i	thought	i	had	to	do	 a 	 s 	 	a	 begin 	 ning 	 	teacher	:	control	every	conversation	and	 respons 	 e 	 	in	the	 class 	 room 	 	.
it	's	 im 	 possible 	 	.	 the 	 ir 	 	 collect 	 ive 	 	 wis 	 dom 	 	is	much	 great 	 er 	 	than	mine	,	and	i	admit	it	to	them	 open 	 ly 	 	.
so	i	'll	just	share	with	you	some	 st 	 ories 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	of	some	 magic 	 al 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	have	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	game	we	had	a	little	girl	,	and	she	was	the	defense	 mini 	 ster 	 	of	the	 poor 	 est 	 	nation	.
and	the	defense	 mini 	 ster 	 	--	she	had	the	tank	 corp 	 s 	 	and	air	force	and	so	forth	.
and	she	was	next	door	to	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 wealth 	 y 	 	,	oil	-	rich	neighbor	.
 with 	 out 	 	 pro 	 voc 	 ation 	 	,	 sudden 	 ly 	 	she	 attack 	 ed 	 	,	against	her	prime	 mini 	 ster 	 	's	 order 	 s 	 	,	the	next	-	door	neighbor	's	oil	 field 	 s 	 	.
she	 march 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	oil	field	 re 	 serve 	 s 	 	,	 surround 	 ed 	 	it	,	 with 	 out 	 	 fir 	 ing 	 	a	shot	,	and	 secure 	 d 	 	it	and	held	it	.
and	that	neighbor	was	 un 	 able 	 	to	conduct	any	 militar 	 y 	 	 operation 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	fuel	supply	was	 lock 	 ed 	 	up	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	all	 up 	 set 	 	with	her	,	``	why	are	you	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	world	peace	game	.	what	is	wrong	with	you	?	``
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	little	girl	and	,	at	nine	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	she	held	her	 piece 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	know	what	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	.	``
to	her	 girlfriend 	 s 	 	she	 s 	 aid 	 	that	.
that	's	a	 b 	 reach 	 	there	.
and	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	ever	want	to	cross	a	nine	year	-	old	girl	with	 tank 	 s 	 	.
they	are	the	 tough 	 est 	 	 opponent 	 s 	 	.
and	we	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 up 	 set 	 	.
i	thought	i	was	 fail 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	teacher	.	why	would	she	do	 th 	 is 	 	?
but	come	to	find	out	,	a	few	game	 day 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	--	and	there	are	 turn 	 s 	 	where	we	take	 negoti 	 ation 	 	from	a	team	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	there	's	a	 negoti 	 ation 	 	period	with	all	 team 	 s 	 	,	and	each	team	 take 	 s 	 	a	turn	,	then	we	go	back	in	 negoti 	 ation 	 	,	around	and	around	,	so	each	turn	around	is	one	game	day	.
so	a	few	game	 day 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	it	came	to	light	that	we	found	out	 th 	 is 	 	major	country	was	 plan 	 ning 	 	a	 militar 	 y 	 	offensive	to	dominate	the	entire	world	.
had	they	had	 the 	 ir 	 	fuel	 suppli 	 es 	 	,	they	would	have	 d 	 one 	 	it	.
she	was	able	to	see	the	 vector 	 s 	 	and	trend	lines	and	 intent 	 ions 	 	long	before	any	of	us	and	understand	what	was	going	to	happen	and	made	a	 philosoph 	 ical 	 	decision	to	attack	in	a	peace	game	.
now	she	used	a	small	war	to	 a 	 vert 	 	a	 large 	 r 	 	war	,	so	we	 stop 	 ped 	 	and	had	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 philosoph 	 ical 	 	 discuss 	 ion 	 	about	 whet 	 her 	 	that	was	right	,	 condition 	 al 	 	good	,	or	not	right	.
that	's	the	kind	of	 think 	 ing 	 	that	we	put	them	in	,	the	 situ 	 ations 	 	.
i	could	not	have	designed	that	in	 teach 	 ing 	 	it	.
it	came	about	 spontane 	 ously 	 	through	 the 	 ir 	 	 collect 	 ive 	 	 wis 	 dom 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	thing	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
we	have	a	letter	in	the	game	.
if	you	're	a	 militar 	 y 	 	 command 	 er 	 	and	you	wage	 troop 	 s 	 	--	the	little	plastic	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	on	the	board	--	and	you	lose	them	,	i	put	in	a	letter	.
you	have	to	write	a	letter	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	--	the	 fiction 	 al 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	of	your	 fiction 	 al 	 	 troop 	 s 	 	--	 explain 	 ing 	 	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	and	 off 	 er 	 ing 	 	your	 condolence 	 s 	 	.
so	you	have	a	little	bit	more	thought	before	you	commit	to	combat	.
and	so	we	had	 th 	 is 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	come	up	--	last	summer	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	at	agnor	-	hurt	school	in	albemarle	 count 	 y 	 	--	and	one	of	our	 militar 	 y 	 	 command 	 ers 	 	got	up	to	read	that	letter	and	one	of	the	other	 kid 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	mr.	hunter	,	let	's	ask	--	there	's	a	parent	over	there	.	``
there	was	a	parent	 visit 	 ing 	 	that	day	,	just	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	the	back	of	the	room	.
``	let	's	ask	that	mom	to	read	the	letter	.
it	'll	be	more	 real 	 er 	 	if	she	 read 	 s 	 	it	.	``
so	we	did	,	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	her	,	and	she	 game 	 ly 	 	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	the	letter	.
``	 s 	 ure 	 	.	``	she	 start 	 ed 	 	 read 	 ing 	 	.	she	read	one	sentence	.
she	read	two	 sentence 	 s 	 	.
by	the	third	sentence	,	she	was	in	 tear 	 s 	 	.
i	was	in	 tear 	 s 	 	.
 every 	 body 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	that	when	we	lose	 some 	 body 	 	,	the	 winner 	 s 	 	are	not	 gl 	 o 	 ating 	 	.
we	all	lose	.
and	it	was	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 occur 	 rence 	 	and	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 understand 	 ing 	 	.
i	'll	show	you	what	my	friend	david	 say 	 s 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
he	's	 be 	 en 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	 battle 	 s 	 	.
david	:	we	've	 re 	 ally 	 	had	 en 	 ough 	 	of	people	 attack 	 ing 	 	.
i	mean	,	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	[	most	of	]	the	time	.
but	now	i	'm	 feel 	 ing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	weird	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	living	what	 s 	 un 	 	tzu	 s 	 aid 	 	one	week	.
one	week	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 t 	 hose 	 	who	go	 in 	 to 	 	battle	and	win	will	want	to	go	back	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	who	lose	in	battle	will	want	to	go	back	and	win	.	``
and	so	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	winning	 battle 	 s 	 	,	so	i	'm	going	 in 	 to 	 	 battle 	 s 	 	,	more	 battle 	 s 	 	.
and	i	think	it	's	sort	of	weird	to	be	living	what	 s 	 un 	 	tzu	 s 	 aid 	 	.
jh	:	i	get	 chill 	 s 	 	every	time	i	see	that	.
that	's	the	kind	of	 engage 	 ment 	 	you	want	to	have	happen	.
and	i	ca	n't	design	that	,	i	ca	n't	plan	that	,	and	i	ca	n't	even	test	that	.
but	it	's	self	-	evident	 assess 	 ment 	 	.
we	know	that	's	an	authentic	 assess 	 ment 	 	of	 learn 	 ing 	 	.
we	have	a	lot	of	data	,	but	i	think	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	we	go	beyond	data	with	the	real	truth	of	what	's	going	on	.
so	i	'll	just	share	a	third	story	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	about	my	friend	brennan	.
we	had	 play 	 ed 	 	the	game	one	session	after	school	for	 man 	 y 	 	 week 	 s 	 	,	about	seven	 week 	 s 	 	,	and	we	had	 essential 	 ly 	 	 solve 	 d 	 	all	50	of	the	 inter 	 lock 	 ing 	 	 cri 	 s 	 es 	 	.
the	way	the	game	is	won	is	all	50	 problem 	 s 	 	have	to	be	 solve 	 d 	 	and	every	country	's	asset	value	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	above	 it 	 s 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	point	.
some	are	poor	,	some	are	 wealth 	 y 	 	.	there	are	 billion 	 s 	 	.
the	world	bank	 p 	 resident 	 	was	a	third	-	 grad 	 er 	 	one	time	.
he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	how	 man 	 y 	 	 zero 	 s 	 	in	a	trillion	?	i	've	got	to	 calcul 	 ate 	 	that	right	away	.	``
but	he	was	setting	 fisc 	 al 	 	policy	in	that	game	for	high	school	 player 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	with	him	.
so	the	team	that	was	the	 poor 	 est 	 	had	gotten	even	 poor 	 er 	 	.
there	was	no	way	they	could	win	.
and	we	 we 	 re 	 	 approach 	 ing 	 	four	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	,	our	cut	-	off	time	--	there	was	about	a	minute	left	--	and	despair	just	 settl 	 ed 	 	over	the	room	.
i	thought	,	i	'm	 fail 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	teacher	.
i	should	have	gotten	it	so	they	could	have	won	.
they	should	n't	be	 fail 	 ing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	've	 fail 	 ed 	 	them	.
and	i	was	just	 feel 	 ing 	 	so	 s 	 ad 	 	and	 d 	 eject 	 ed 	 	.
and	 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	brennan	 walk 	 ed 	 	over	to	my	chair	and	he	 grab 	 bed 	 	the	bell	,	the	bell	i	ring	to	signal	a	change	or	a	 re 	 conven 	 ing 	 	of	 cabinet 	 s 	 	,	and	he	ran	back	to	his	seat	,	rang	the	bell	.
 every 	 body 	 	ran	to	his	chair	:	there	was	 s 	 cream 	 ing 	 	;	there	was	 yell 	 ing 	 	,	 wav 	 ing 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 do 	 ssi 	 ers 	 	.
they	get	these	 do 	 ssi 	 ers 	 	full	of	secret	 document 	 s 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 gesticul 	 ating 	 	;	they	 we 	 re 	 	running	around	.
i	did	n't	know	what	they	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	.	i	'd	lost	control	of	my	 class 	 room 	 	.
principal	 walk 	 s 	 	in	,	i	'm	out	of	a	job	.
the	 parent 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	looking	in	the	window	.
and	brennan	 run 	 s 	 	back	to	his	seat	.	 every 	 body 	 	 run 	 s 	 	back	to	 the 	 ir 	 	seat	.
he	 ring 	 s 	 	the	bell	 aga 	 in 	 	.	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	we	have	``	--	and	there	's	12	 second 	 s 	 	left	on	the	clock	--	``	we	have	,	all	 nation 	 s 	 	,	 pool 	 ed 	 	all	our	 fund 	 s 	 	together	.
and	we	've	got	600	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
we	're	going	to	 off 	 er 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	 don 	 ation 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	poor	country	.
and	if	they	accept	it	,	it	'll	raise	 the 	 ir 	 	asset	value	and	we	can	win	the	game	.
will	you	accept	it	?	``
and	there	are	three	 second 	 s 	 	left	on	the	clock	.
 every 	 body 	 	 look 	 s 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	prime	 mini 	 ster 	 	of	that	country	,	and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	.	``
and	the	game	is	won	.
 spontane 	 ous 	 	 compass 	 ion 	 	that	could	not	be	 plan 	 ned 	 	for	,	that	was	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	and	 un 	 predict 	 able 	 	.
every	game	we	play	is	different	.
some	 game 	 s 	 	are	more	about	social	 issue 	 s 	 	,	some	are	more	about	economic	 issue 	 s 	 	.
some	 game 	 s 	 	are	more	about	 war 	 fare 	 	.
but	i	do	n't	try	to	 den 	 y 	 	them	that	 re 	 ality 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	human	.
i	allow	them	to	go	there	and	,	through	 the 	 ir 	 	own	experience	,	learn	,	in	a	 blood 	 less 	 	way	,	how	not	to	do	what	they	consider	to	be	the	wrong	thing	.
and	they	find	out	what	is	right	 the 	 ir 	 	own	way	,	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 s 	 elves 	 	.
and	so	in	 th 	 is 	 	game	,	i	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	so	much	from	it	,	but	i	would	say	that	if	 on 	 ly 	 	they	could	pick	up	a	critical	 think 	 ing 	 	tool	or	creative	 think 	 ing 	 	tool	from	 th 	 is 	 	game	and	leverage	 some 	 thing 	 	good	for	the	world	,	they	may	 s 	 ave 	 	us	all	.
if	 on 	 ly 	 	.
and	on	 be 	 half 	 	of	all	of	my	 teacher 	 s 	 	on	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 shoulder 	 s 	 	i	'm	 stand 	 ing 	 	,	thank	you	.	thank	you	.	thank	you	.
