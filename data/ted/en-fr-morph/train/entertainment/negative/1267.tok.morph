 human 	 s 	 	have	long	held	a	 fasci 	 nation 	 	for	the	human	brain	.
we	chart	it	,	we	've	 de 	 scribed 	 	it	,	we	've	drawn	it	,	we	've	 ma 	 pped 	 	it	.
now	just	like	the	physical	 map 	 s 	 	of	our	world	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	 high 	 ly 	 	 influence 	 d 	 	by	technology	--	think	google	 map 	 s 	 	,	think	gps	--	the	same	thing	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	for	brain	mapping	through	 transform 	 ation 	 	.
so	let	's	take	a	look	at	the	brain	.
most	people	,	when	they	first	look	at	a	fresh	human	brain	,	they	say	,	``	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	look	what	you	're	 typical 	 ly 	 	looking	at	when	 some 	 one 	 	 show 	 s 	 	you	a	brain	.	``	 typical 	 ly 	 	,	what	you	're	looking	at	is	a	 fix 	 ed 	 	brain	.	it	's	gray	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 out 	 er 	 	layer	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 va 	 s 	 cul 	 ature 	 	,	which	is	 in 	 credible 	 	,	around	a	human	brain	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	.
20	percent	of	the	oxygen	coming	from	your	 lung 	 s 	 	,	20	percent	of	the	blood	 pump 	 ed 	 	from	your	heart	,	is	 serv 	 ic 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	one	organ	.
that	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	if	you	hold	two	 fist 	 s 	 	together	,	it	's	just	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 large 	 r 	 	than	the	two	 fist 	 s 	 	.
 scientist 	 s 	 	,	sort	of	at	the	end	of	the	20th	century	,	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	they	could	track	blood	flow	to	map	non	-	 invasive 	 ly 	 	where	activity	was	going	on	in	the	human	brain	.
so	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	they	can	see	in	the	back	part	of	the	brain	,	which	is	just	 turn 	 ing 	 	around	there	.
there	's	the	 ce 	 rebel 	 lum 	 	;	that	's	 keep 	 ing 	 	you	 up 	 right 	 	right	now	.
it	's	 keep 	 ing 	 	me	 stand 	 ing 	 	.	it	's	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 coordinate 	 d 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	.
on	the	side	here	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	temporal	cortex	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	area	where	 prim 	 ary 	 	 audit 	 ory 	 	 process 	 ing 	 	--	so	you	're	 hear 	 ing 	 	my	 word 	 s 	 	,	you	're	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	it	up	 in 	 to 	 	 high 	 er 	 	language	 process 	 ing 	 	 center 	 s 	 	.
 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	front	of	the	brain	is	the	place	in	which	all	of	the	more	complex	thought	,	decision	making	--	it	's	the	last	to	mature	in	late	 adult 	 hood 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	where	all	your	decision	-	making	 process 	 es 	 	are	going	on	.
it	's	the	place	where	you	're	 dec 	 id 	 ing 	 	right	now	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	are	n't	going	to	order	the	steak	for	 d 	 inner 	 	.
so	if	you	take	a	 deep 	 er 	 	look	at	the	brain	,	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	,	if	you	look	at	it	in	cross	-	section	,	what	you	can	see	is	that	you	ca	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	see	a	whole	lot	of	structure	there	.
but	there	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	lot	of	structure	there	.
it	's	 cell 	 s 	 	and	it	's	 wire 	 s 	 	all	wired	together	.
so	about	a	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	some	 scientist 	 s 	 	 invent 	 ed 	 	a	stain	that	would	stain	 cell 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	 show 	 n 	 	here	in	the	the	 ver 	 y 	 	light	blue	.
you	can	see	 area 	 s 	 	where	 neuro 	 nal 	 	cell	bodies	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 stain 	 ed 	 	.
and	what	you	can	see	is	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	non	-	uniform	.	you	see	a	lot	more	structure	there	.
so	the	 out 	 er 	 	part	of	that	brain	is	the	 neo 	 cortex 	 	.
it	's	one	 continu 	 ous 	 	 process 	 ing 	 	unit	,	if	you	will	.
but	you	can	 al 	 so 	 	see	 thing 	 s 	 	 under 	 neath 	 	there	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
and	all	of	these	blank	 area 	 s 	 	are	the	 area 	 s 	 	in	which	the	 wire 	 s 	 	are	running	through	.
they	're	 prob 	 ably 	 	less	cell	dense	.
so	there	's	about	86	billion	 neuro 	 ns 	 	in	our	brain	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	non	-	 uniform 	 ly 	 	 distribut 	 ed 	 	.
and	how	they	're	 distribut 	 ed 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 con 	 tribute 	 s 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	function	.
and	of	course	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	before	,	since	we	can	now	start	to	map	brain	function	,	we	can	start	to	tie	these	 in 	 to 	 	the	individual	 cell 	 s 	 	.
so	let	's	take	a	 deep 	 er 	 	look	.
let	's	look	at	 neuro 	 ns 	 	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	i	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	,	there	are	86	billion	 neuro 	 ns 	 	.
there	are	 al 	 so 	 	these	 small 	 er 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	'll	see	.
these	are	support	 cell 	 s 	 	--	 astro 	 cytes 	 	glia	.
and	the	 nerve 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	are	the	 one 	 s 	 	who	are	 receiv 	 ing 	 	 in 	 put 	 	.
they	're	storing	it	,	they	're	 process 	 ing 	 	it	.
each	 neuro 	 n 	 	is	 connect 	 ed 	 	via	 synapse 	 s 	 	to	up	to	10,000	other	 neuro 	 ns 	 	in	your	brain	.
and	each	 neuro 	 n 	 	 it 	 self 	 	is	 large 	 ly 	 	 un 	 ique 	 	.
the	 un 	 ique 	 	character	of	both	individual	 neuro 	 ns 	 	and	 neuro 	 ns 	 	 with 	 in 	 	a	 collect 	 ion 	 	of	the	brain	are	driven	by	fundamental	 proper 	 ties 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	 bio 	 chemist 	 ry 	 	.
these	are	 protein 	 s 	 	.
they	're	 protein 	 s 	 	that	are	 controll 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	ion	channel	 move 	 ment 	 	.
they	're	 controll 	 ing 	 	who	nervous	system	 cell 	 s 	 	partner	up	with	.
and	they	're	 controll 	 ing 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	that	the	nervous	system	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	.
so	if	we	zoom	in	to	an	even	 deep 	 er 	 	level	,	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 protein 	 s 	 	are	 encode 	 d 	 	by	our	 genome 	 s 	 	.
we	each	have	23	 pair 	 s 	 	of	 chromosom 	 es 	 	.
we	get	one	from	mom	,	one	from	dad	.
and	on	these	 chromosom 	 es 	 	are	 rough 	 ly 	 	25,000	 gene 	 s 	 	.
they	're	 encode 	 d 	 	in	the	dna	.
and	the	nature	of	a	 give 	 n 	 	cell	 driv 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	 bio 	 chemist 	 ry 	 	is	 dict 	 ated 	 	by	which	of	these	25,000	 gene 	 s 	 	are	 turn 	 ed 	 	on	and	at	what	level	they	're	 turn 	 ed 	 	on	.
and	so	our	project	is	seeking	to	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	 read 	 out 	 	,	 understand 	 ing 	 	which	of	these	25,000	 gene 	 s 	 	is	 turn 	 ed 	 	on	.
so	in	order	to	 under 	 take 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	a	project	,	we	 obvious 	 ly 	 	need	 brain 	 s 	 	.
so	we	 s 	 ent 	 	our	lab	technician	out	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	seeking	normal	human	 brain 	 s 	 	.
what	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	start	with	is	a	medical	 examine 	 r 	 	's	 off 	 ice 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	a	place	where	the	dead	are	 br 	 ought 	 	in	.
we	are	seeking	normal	human	 brain 	 s 	 	.
there	's	a	lot	of	 cri 	 ter 	 ia 	 	by	which	we	're	 select 	 ing 	 	these	 brain 	 s 	 	.
we	want	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	we	have	normal	 human 	 s 	 	between	the	 age 	 s 	 	of	20	to	60	,	they	 di 	 ed 	 	a	 some 	 what 	 	natural	death	with	no	 in 	 jury 	 	to	the	brain	,	no	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 psych 	 iatric 	 	disease	,	no	 drug 	 s 	 	on	board	--	we	do	a	 toxic 	 ology 	 	 work 	 up 	 	.
and	we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 care 	 ful 	 	about	the	 brain 	 s 	 	that	we	do	take	.
we	're	 al 	 so 	 	 select 	 ing 	 	for	 brain 	 s 	 	in	which	we	can	get	the	tissue	,	we	can	get	consent	to	take	the	tissue	 with 	 in 	 	24	 hour 	 s 	 	of	time	of	death	.
 be 	 cause 	 	what	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	measure	,	the	rna	--	which	is	the	 read 	 out 	 	from	our	 gene 	 s 	 	--	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 lab 	 ile 	 	,	and	so	we	have	to	move	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
one	side	note	on	the	 collect 	 ion 	 	of	 brain 	 s 	 	:	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	way	that	we	collect	,	and	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 requir 	 e 	 	consent	,	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	a	lot	more	male	 brain 	 s 	 	than	female	 brain 	 s 	 	.
 male 	 s 	 	are	much	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	die	an	 accident 	 al 	 	death	in	the	prime	of	 the 	 ir 	 	life	.
and	men	are	much	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	have	 the 	 ir 	 	significant	other	,	spouse	,	give	consent	than	the	other	way	around	.
so	the	first	thing	that	we	do	at	the	 s 	 ite 	 	of	 collect 	 ion 	 	is	we	collect	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	an	mr	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 magnet 	 ic 	 	 reson 	 ance 	 	 im 	 aging 	 	--	mri	.
it	's	a	standard	template	by	which	we	're	going	to	hang	the	rest	of	 th 	 is 	 	data	.
so	we	collect	 th 	 is 	 	mr	.
and	you	can	think	of	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	our	satellite	view	for	our	map	.
the	next	thing	we	do	is	we	collect	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	a	diffusion	 ten 	 s 	 or 	 	 im 	 aging 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 map 	 s 	 	the	large	 ca 	 bling 	 	in	the	brain	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	you	can	think	of	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 al 	 most 	 	mapping	our	 inter 	 state 	 	 high 	 ways 	 	,	if	you	will	.
the	brain	is	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	from	the	skull	,	and	then	it	's	 slice 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	one	-	centimeter	 slice 	 s 	 	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	are	 froze 	 n 	 	solid	,	and	they	're	 ship 	 ped 	 	to	seattle	.
and	in	seattle	,	we	take	these	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	whole	human	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	--	and	we	put	them	 in 	 to 	 	what	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	a	 glor 	 ified 	 	meat	 slice 	 r 	 	.
there	's	a	blade	here	that	's	going	to	cut	 a 	 cross 	 	a	section	of	the	tissue	and	transfer	it	to	a	 micro 	 scope 	 	slide	.
we	're	going	to	then	 app 	 ly 	 	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 stain 	 s 	 	to	it	,	and	we	 s 	 can 	 	it	.
and	then	what	we	get	is	our	first	mapping	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	 expert 	 s 	 	come	in	and	they	make	 bas 	 ic 	 	 an 	 atomic 	 	 assign 	 ments 	 	.
you	could	consider	 th 	 is 	 	state	 bound 	 aries 	 	,	if	you	will	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	broad	 out 	 lines 	 	.
from	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	're	able	to	then	fragment	that	brain	 in 	 to 	 	further	 piece 	 s 	 	,	which	then	we	can	put	on	a	 small 	 er 	 	 cryo 	 stat 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	 show 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	here	--	 th 	 is 	 	 froze 	 n 	 	tissue	,	and	it	's	 be 	 ing 	 	cut	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	20	 micro 	 ns 	 	thin	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	about	a	baby	hair	's	width	.
and	remember	,	it	's	 froze 	 n 	 	.
and	so	you	can	see	here	,	old	-	 fashion 	 ed 	 	technology	of	the	 paint 	 brush 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 appli 	 ed 	 	.
we	take	a	 micro 	 scope 	 	slide	.
then	we	 ver 	 y 	 	 care 	 fully 	 	melt	onto	the	slide	.
 th 	 is 	 	will	then	go	onto	a	robot	that	's	going	to	 app 	 ly 	 	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 stain 	 s 	 	to	it	.
and	our	 anatomist 	 s 	 	are	going	to	go	in	and	take	a	 deep 	 er 	 	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	 aga 	 in 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	they	can	see	under	the	 micro 	 scope 	 	.
you	can	see	 collect 	 ions 	 	and	 configu 	 ration 	 s 	 	of	large	and	small	 cell 	 s 	 	in	 cluster 	 s 	 	and	 vari 	 ous 	 	 place 	 s 	 	.
and	from	there	it	's	routine	.	they	understand	where	to	make	these	 assign 	 ments 	 	.
and	they	can	make	 bas 	 ically 	 	what	's	a	 re 	 ference 	 	atlas	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	more	 detail 	 ed 	 	map	.
our	 scientist 	 s 	 	then	use	 th 	 is 	 	to	go	back	to	 an 	 other 	 	piece	of	that	tissue	and	do	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	laser	 s 	 canning 	 	 micro 	 dis 	 section 	 	.
so	the	technician	 take 	 s 	 	the	 instruct 	 ions 	 	.
they	scribe	 a 	 long 	 	a	place	there	.
and	then	the	laser	 actual 	 ly 	 	 cut 	 s 	 	.
you	can	see	that	blue	dot	there	cutting	.	and	that	tissue	 fall 	 s 	 	off	.
you	can	see	on	the	 micro 	 scope 	 	slide	here	,	that	's	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	real	time	.
there	's	a	 contain 	 er 	 	 under 	 neath 	 	that	's	 collect 	 ing 	 	that	tissue	.
we	take	that	tissue	,	we	 pur 	 ify 	 	the	rna	out	of	it	using	some	 bas 	 ic 	 	technology	,	and	then	we	put	a	 flor 	 escent 	 	tag	on	it	.
we	take	that	 tag 	 ged 	 	material	and	we	put	it	on	to	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	a	 micro 	 array 	 	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	may	look	like	a	bunch	of	 dot 	 s 	 	to	you	,	but	each	one	of	these	individual	 dot 	 s 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 un 	 ique 	 	piece	of	the	human	genome	that	we	 spot 	 ted 	 	down	on	glass	.
 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 rough 	 ly 	 	60,000	 element 	 s 	 	on	it	,	so	we	 repeat 	 ed 	 ly 	 	measure	 vari 	 ous 	 	 gene 	 s 	 	of	the	25,000	 gene 	 s 	 	in	the	genome	.
and	when	we	take	a	 s 	 ample 	 	and	we	 hybrid 	 ize 	 	it	to	it	,	we	get	a	 un 	 ique 	 	 finger 	 print 	 	,	if	you	will	,	 quant 	 itative 	 ly 	 	of	what	 gene 	 s 	 	are	 turn 	 ed 	 	on	in	that	 s 	 ample 	 	.
now	we	do	 th 	 is 	 	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	process	for	any	 give 	 n 	 	brain	.
we	're	taking	over	a	thousand	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	for	each	brain	.
 th 	 is 	 	area	 show 	 n 	 	here	is	an	area	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 hippo 	 campus 	 	.
it	's	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 learn 	 ing 	 	and	 memor 	 y 	 	.
and	it	 con 	 tribute 	 s 	 	to	about	70	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	thousand	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
so	each	 s 	 ample 	 	 get 	 s 	 	us	about	50,000	data	 point 	 s 	 	with	repeat	 measure 	 ments 	 	,	a	thousand	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
so	 rough 	 ly 	 	,	we	have	50	million	data	 point 	 s 	 	for	a	 give 	 n 	 	human	brain	.
we	've	 d 	 one 	 	right	now	two	human	 brain 	 s 	 	-	worth	of	data	.
we	've	put	all	of	that	together	 in 	 to 	 	one	thing	,	and	i	'll	show	you	what	that	synthesis	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
it	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	a	large	data	set	of	information	that	's	all	 free 	 ly 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	to	any	scientist	around	the	world	.
they	do	n't	even	have	to	log	in	to	come	use	 th 	 is 	 	tool	,	mine	 th 	 is 	 	data	,	find	 interest 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	out	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	here	's	the	 mod 	 al 	 ities 	 	that	we	put	together	.
you	'll	start	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	from	what	we	've	 collect 	 ed 	 	before	.
here	's	the	mr.	it	 provide 	 s 	 	the	 frame 	 work 	 	.
there	's	an	 oper 	 ator 	 	side	on	the	right	that	 allow 	 s 	 	you	to	turn	,	it	 allow 	 s 	 	you	to	zoom	in	,	it	 allow 	 s 	 	you	to	 high 	 light 	 	individual	 structure 	 s 	 	.
but	most	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	we	're	now	mapping	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 an 	 atomic 	 	 frame 	 work 	 	,	which	is	a	common	 frame 	 work 	 	for	people	to	understand	where	 gene 	 s 	 	are	 turn 	 ed 	 	on	.
so	the	red	 level 	 s 	 	are	where	a	gene	is	 turn 	 ed 	 	on	to	a	great	degree	.
green	is	the	sort	of	cool	 area 	 s 	 	where	it	's	not	 turn 	 ed 	 	on	.
and	each	gene	 give 	 s 	 	us	a	 finger 	 print 	 	.
and	remember	that	we	've	 assay 	 ed 	 	all	the	25,000	 gene 	 s 	 	in	the	genome	and	have	all	of	that	data	 avail 	 able 	 	.
so	what	can	 scientist 	 s 	 	learn	about	 th 	 is 	 	data	?
we	're	just	 start 	 ing 	 	to	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	data	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
there	's	some	 bas 	 ic 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	would	want	to	understand	.
two	great	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	are	 drug 	 s 	 	,	prozac	and	wellbutrin	.
these	are	 common 	 ly 	 	 pre 	 scribed 	 	 anti 	 depress 	 ants 	 	.
now	remember	,	we	're	 assay 	 ing 	 	 gene 	 s 	 	.
 gene 	 s 	 	 s 	 end 	 	the	 instruct 	 ions 	 	to	make	 protein 	 s 	 	.
 protein 	 s 	 	are	 target 	 s 	 	for	 drug 	 s 	 	.
so	 drug 	 s 	 	bind	to	 protein 	 s 	 	and	either	turn	them	off	,	etc	.
so	if	you	want	to	understand	the	action	of	 drug 	 s 	 	,	you	want	to	understand	how	they	're	 act 	 ing 	 	in	the	ways	you	want	them	to	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	in	the	ways	you	do	n't	want	them	to	.
in	the	side	effect	profile	,	etc	.	,	you	want	to	see	where	 t 	 hose 	 	 gene 	 s 	 	are	 turn 	 ed 	 	on	.
and	for	the	first	time	,	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	that	.
we	can	do	that	in	 multi 	 ple 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	that	we	've	 assay 	 ed 	 	too	.
so	now	we	can	look	 through 	 out 	 	the	brain	.
we	can	see	 th 	 is 	 	 un 	 ique 	 	 finger 	 print 	 	.
and	we	get	 confirm 	 ation 	 	.
we	get	 confirm 	 ation 	 	that	,	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	the	gene	is	 turn 	 ed 	 	on	--	for	 some 	 thing 	 	like	prozac	,	in	 s 	 ero 	 tone 	 rgic 	 	 structure 	 s 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 al 	 ready 	 	known	be	 affect 	 ed 	 	--	but	we	 al 	 so 	 	get	to	see	the	whole	thing	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	get	to	see	 area 	 s 	 	that	no	one	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	 look 	 ed 	 	at	before	,	and	we	see	these	 gene 	 s 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	on	there	.
it	's	 a 	 s 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	a	side	effect	 a 	 s 	 	it	could	be	.
one	other	thing	you	can	do	with	 s 	 uch 	 	a	thing	is	you	can	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	a	pattern	 match 	 ing 	 	 exercis 	 e 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	 un 	 ique 	 	 finger 	 print 	 	,	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 can 	 	through	the	entire	genome	and	find	other	 protein 	 s 	 	that	show	a	similar	 finger 	 print 	 	.
so	if	you	're	in	drug	 discover 	 y 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	you	can	go	through	an	entire	 list 	 ing 	 	of	what	the	genome	 ha 	 s 	 	on	 off 	 er 	 	to	find	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	better	drug	 target 	 s 	 	and	optimize	.
most	of	you	are	 prob 	 ably 	 	familiar	with	genome	-	wide	 associ 	 ation 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	in	the	form	of	people	 cover 	 ing 	 	in	the	news	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	 scientist 	 s 	 	have	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	the	gene	or	 gene 	 s 	 	which	affect	x.	``	and	so	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 stud 	 ies 	 	are	 routine 	 ly 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	by	 scientist 	 s 	 	and	they	're	great	.	they	 analyz 	 e 	 	large	 population 	 s 	 	.
they	look	at	 the 	 ir 	 	entire	 genome 	 s 	 	,	and	they	try	to	find	hot	 spot 	 s 	 	of	activity	that	are	linked	 caus 	 ally 	 	to	 gene 	 s 	 	.
but	what	you	get	out	of	 s 	 uch 	 	an	 exercis 	 e 	 	is	 simpl 	 y 	 	a	list	of	 gene 	 s 	 	.
it	 tell 	 s 	 	you	the	what	,	but	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	tell	you	the	where	.
and	so	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	for	 t 	 hose 	 	 research 	 ers 	 	that	we	've	 create 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	resource	.
now	they	can	come	in	and	they	can	start	to	get	 clue 	 s 	 	about	activity	.
they	can	start	to	look	at	common	 path 	 ways 	 	--	other	 thing 	 s 	 	that	they	 simpl 	 y 	 	have	n't	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	do	before	.
so	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	audience	in	 part 	 icular 	 	can	understand	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	 individual 	 ity 	 	.
and	i	think	every	human	,	we	all	have	different	genetic	 back 	 ground 	 s 	 	,	we	all	have	lived	 separat 	 e 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
but	the	fact	is	our	 genome 	 s 	 	are	 great 	 er 	 	than	99	percent	similar	.
we	're	similar	at	the	genetic	level	.
and	what	we	're	 find 	 ing 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	even	at	the	brain	 bio 	 chemical 	 	level	,	we	are	 quit 	 e 	 	similar	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	 show 	 s 	 	it	's	not	99	percent	,	but	it	's	 rough 	 ly 	 	90	percent	 correspond 	 ence 	 	at	a	 reason 	 able 	 	 cut 	 off 	 	,	so	 every 	 thing 	 	in	the	cloud	is	 rough 	 ly 	 	 correlate 	 d 	 	.
and	then	we	find	some	 out 	 lier 	 s 	 	,	some	 thing 	 s 	 	that	lie	beyond	the	cloud	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	 gene 	 s 	 	are	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	but	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	subtle	.
so	i	think	it	's	an	 import 	 ant 	 	 mess 	 age 	 	to	take	home	 to 	 day 	 	that	even	 th 	 ough 	 	we	 celebr 	 ate 	 	all	of	our	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	,	we	are	 quit 	 e 	 	similar	even	at	the	brain	level	.
now	what	do	 t 	 hose 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	look	like	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	a	 stud 	 y 	 	that	we	did	to	follow	up	and	see	what	 exact 	 ly 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	--	and	they	're	 quit 	 e 	 	subtle	.
these	are	 thing 	 s 	 	where	 gene 	 s 	 	are	 turn 	 ed 	 	on	in	an	individual	cell	type	.
these	are	two	 gene 	 s 	 	that	we	found	 a 	 s 	 	good	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
one	is	 call 	 ed 	 	reln	--	it	's	 involve 	 d 	 	in	early	 develop 	 mental 	 	 cue 	 s 	 	.
 dis 	 c 	 	1	is	a	gene	that	's	 delet 	 ed 	 	in	 schizo 	 phrenia 	 	.
these	are	n't	schizophrenic	 individual 	 s 	 	,	but	they	do	show	some	population	 vari 	 ation 	 	.
and	so	what	you	're	looking	at	here	in	donor	one	and	donor	four	,	which	are	the	 exception 	 s 	 	to	the	other	two	,	that	 gene 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	on	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	specific	 sub 	 set 	 	of	 cell 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 th 	 is 	 	dark	 pur 	 ple 	 	 precipit 	 ate 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	cell	that	's	 tell 	 ing 	 	us	a	gene	is	 turn 	 ed 	 	on	there	.
 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	that	's	due	to	an	individual	's	genetic	 back 	 ground 	 	or	 the 	 ir 	 	 experience 	 s 	 	,	we	do	n't	know	.
 t 	 hose 	 	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 stud 	 ies 	 	 requir 	 e 	 	much	 large 	 r 	 	 population 	 s 	 	.
so	i	'm	going	to	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	a	final	note	about	the	 complex 	 ity 	 	of	the	brain	and	how	much	more	we	have	to	go	.
i	think	these	 resource 	 s 	 	are	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 valu 	 able 	 	.
they	give	 research 	 ers 	 	a	handle	on	where	to	go	.
but	we	 on 	 ly 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	at	a	 hand 	 ful 	 	of	 individual 	 s 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	.
we	're	 certain 	 ly 	 	going	to	be	looking	at	more	.
i	'll	just	close	by	 say 	 ing 	 	that	the	 tool 	 s 	 	are	there	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 tru 	 ly 	 	an	 un 	 explore 	 d 	 	,	 un 	 discover 	 ed 	 	continent	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	new	 front 	 ier 	 	,	if	you	will	.
and	so	for	 t 	 hose 	 	who	are	 un 	 daunt 	 ed 	 	,	but	 humble 	 d 	 	by	the	 complex 	 ity 	 	of	the	brain	,	the	future	 await 	 s 	 	.
 thank 	 s 	 	.
