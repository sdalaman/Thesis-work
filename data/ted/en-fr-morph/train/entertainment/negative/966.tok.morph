i	got	up	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	at	6:10	 a.m 	 . 	 	after	going	to	sleep	at	12:45	a.m	.
i	was	 awake 	 ned 	 	once	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	night	.
my	heart	rate	was	61	 beat 	 s 	 	per	minute	--
my	blood	pressure	,	127	over	74	.
i	had	zero	 minute 	 s 	 	of	 exercis 	 e 	 	 yester 	 day 	 	,	so	my	 maxim 	 um 	 	heart	rate	 dur 	 ing 	 	 exercis 	 e 	 	was	n't	 calcul 	 ated 	 	.
i	had	about	600	 milli 	 gram 	 s 	 	of	 c 	 affe 	 ine 	 	,	zero	of	alcohol	.
and	my	score	on	the	 nar 	 cis 	 s 	 ism 	 	 personal 	 ity 	 	index	,	or	the	npi	-	16	,	is	a	 re 	 assur 	 ing 	 	0.31	.
we	know	that	 number 	 s 	 	are	 use 	 ful 	 	for	us	when	we	advertise	,	manage	,	govern	,	search	.
i	'm	going	to	talk	about	how	they	're	 use 	 ful 	 	when	we	reflect	,	learn	,	remember	and	want	to	improve	.
a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	kevin	kelly	,	my	partner	,	and	i	 notice 	 d 	 	that	people	 we 	 re 	 	 subject 	 ing 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	 regime 	 s 	 	of	 quant 	 itative 	 	 measure 	 ment 	 	and	self	-	 track 	 ing 	 	that	went	far	beyond	the	 ordin 	 ary 	 	,	familiar	 habit 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 step 	 ping 	 	on	a	scale	every	day	.
people	 we 	 re 	 	 track 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	food	via	twitter	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	'	 dia 	 per 	 s 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	iphone	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	making	 detail 	 ed 	 	 journal 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	mood	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 symptom 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 treat 	 ments 	 	.
now	,	we	know	some	of	the	 techno 	 logical 	 	 fact 	 s 	 	that	are	 driv 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	change	in	our	 life 	 style 	 	--	the	 up 	 take 	 	and	diffusion	of	mobile	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	,	the	exponential	 improve 	 ment 	 	in	data	 s 	 to 	 rage 	 	and	data	 process 	 ing 	 	,	and	the	 remark 	 able 	 	 improve 	 ment 	 	in	human	 bio 	 metric 	 	 sensor 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	little	black	dot	there	is	a	3d	 accele 	 ro 	 meter 	 	.
it	 track 	 s 	 	your	 move 	 ment 	 	through	space	.
it	is	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	 ver 	 y 	 	small	and	 al 	 so 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	cheap	.
they	're	now	down	to	well	under	a	dollar	a	piece	,	and	they	're	going	 in 	 to 	 	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	.
but	what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	the	 in 	 credible 	 	 detail 	 ed 	 	information	that	you	can	get	from	just	one	sensor	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	sensor	is	in	the	hit	 bio 	 metric 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	--	among	early	 adopt 	 ers 	 	at	the	moment	--	the	fitbit	.
 th 	 is 	 	 track 	 s 	 	your	activity	and	 al 	 so 	 	your	sleep	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	just	that	sensor	in	it	.
you	're	 prob 	 ably 	 	familiar	with	the	nike	+	system	.
i	just	put	it	up	 be 	 cause 	 	that	little	blue	dot	is	the	sensor	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	just	a	pressure	sensor	like	the	kind	that	's	in	a	 door 	 bell 	 	.
and	nike	 know 	 s 	 	how	to	get	your	pace	and	distance	from	just	that	sensor	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 s 	 trap 	 	that	people	use	to	transmit	heart	-	rate	data	to	 the 	 ir 	 	nike	+	system	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	new	 de 	 vice 	 	that	 give 	 s 	 	you	 detail 	 ed 	 	sleep	 track 	 ing 	 	data	,	not	just	 whet 	 her 	 	you	're	 a 	 sleep 	 	or	awake	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	your	phase	of	sleep	--	deep	sleep	,	light	sleep	,	rem	sleep	.
the	sensor	is	just	a	little	strip	of	metal	in	that	 head 	 band 	 	there	.
the	rest	of	it	is	the	 bed 	 side 	 	 consol 	 e 	 	;
just	for	 re 	 ference 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	sleep	 track 	 ing 	 	system	from	just	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	--	i	mean	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 un 	 til 	 	now	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	sleep	 track 	 ing 	 	system	of	 to 	 day 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	just	was	 present 	 ed 	 	at	a	health	care	 con 	 ference 	 	in	d.c	.
most	of	what	you	see	there	is	an	asthma	 inhal 	 er 	 	,	but	the	top	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	gps	transceiver	,	which	 give 	 s 	 	you	the	date	and	location	of	an	asthma	incident	,	giving	you	a	new	 aware 	 ness 	 	of	your	 vulner 	 ability 	 	in	relation	to	time	and	 environment 	 al 	 	 factor 	 s 	 	.
now	,	we	know	that	new	 tool 	 s 	 	are	changing	our	sense	of	self	in	the	world	--	these	 tin 	 y 	 	 sensor 	 s 	 	that	gather	data	in	nature	,	the	 ubiqu 	 it 	 ous 	 	computing	that	 allow 	 s 	 	that	data	to	be	 under 	 stood 	 	and	used	,	and	of	course	the	social	 network 	 s 	 	that	allow	people	to	 collabor 	 ate 	 	and	 con 	 tribute 	 	.
but	we	think	of	these	 tool 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 point 	 ing 	 	 out 	 ward 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 window 	 s 	 	and	i	'd	just	like	to	 invit 	 e 	 	you	to	think	of	them	 a 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 turn 	 ing 	 	 in 	 ward 	 	and	 be 	 coming 	 	 mirror 	 s 	 	.
so	that	when	we	think	about	using	them	to	get	some	 system 	 atic 	 	 improve 	 ment 	 	,	we	 al 	 so 	 	think	about	how	they	can	be	 use 	 ful 	 	for	self	-	 improve 	 ment 	 	,	for	self	-	 discover 	 y 	 	,	self	-	 aware 	 ness 	 	,	self	-	knowledge	.
here	's	a	 bio 	 metric 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	:	a	pair	of	apple	earbuds	.
last	year	,	apple	 file 	 d 	 	some	 patent 	 s 	 	to	get	blood	 oxygen 	 ation 	 	,	heart	rate	and	body	temperature	via	the	earbuds	.
what	is	 th 	 is 	 	for	?
what	should	it	be	for	?
some	people	will	say	it	's	for	 bio 	 metric 	 	security	.
some	people	will	say	it	's	for	public	health	research	.
some	people	will	say	it	's	for	avant	-	garde	 market 	 ing 	 	research	.
i	'd	like	to	tell	you	that	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	for	self	-	knowledge	.
and	the	self	is	n't	the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	;	it	's	not	even	most	 thing 	 s 	 	.
the	self	is	just	our	operation	center	,	our	 conscious 	 ness 	 	,	our	moral	compass	.
so	,	if	we	want	to	act	more	 effective 	 ly 	 	in	the	world	,	we	have	to	get	to	know	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	better	.
thank	you	.
