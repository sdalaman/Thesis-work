i	heard	 th 	 is 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	story	about	miuccia	prada	.
she	's	an	italian	fashion	 design 	 er 	 	.
she	 go 	 es 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	vintage	store	in	paris	with	a	friend	of	 her 	 s 	 	.
she	's	 root 	 ing 	 	around	,	she	 find 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	one	jacket	by	balenciaga	--
she	 love 	 s 	 	it	.
she	's	 turn 	 ing 	 	it	 in 	 side 	 	out	.
she	's	looking	at	the	 seam 	 s 	 	.	she	's	looking	at	the	construction	.
her	friend	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	buy	it	 al 	 ready 	 	.	``
she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'll	buy	it	,	but	i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	going	to	replicate	it	.	``
now	,	the	 academic 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	audience	may	think	,	``	well	,	that	 sound 	 s 	 	like	 plagiar 	 ism 	 	.	``
but	to	a	 fashion 	 ista 	 	,	what	it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	is	a	sign	of	prada	's	 gen 	 ius 	 	:	that	she	can	root	through	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	fashion	and	pick	the	one	jacket	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	need	to	be	 change 	 d 	 	by	one	 io 	 ta 	 	,	and	to	be	current	and	to	be	now	.
you	might	 al 	 so 	 	be	 ask 	 ing 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	possible	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	 il 	 legal 	 	for	her	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
well	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	not	 il 	 legal 	 	.
in	the	fashion	industry	,	there	's	 ver 	 y 	 	little	intellectual	 proper 	 ty 	 	 protect 	 ion 	 	.
they	have	 trade 	 mark 	 	 protect 	 ion 	 	,	but	no	 copy 	 right 	 	 protect 	 ion 	 	and	no	patent	 protect 	 ion 	 	to	speak	of	.
all	they	have	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	is	 trade 	 mark 	 	 protect 	 ion 	 	,
and	so	it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	 any 	 body 	 	could	copy	any	 gar 	 ment 	 	on	any	person	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	and	sell	it	 a 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	design	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	that	they	ca	n't	copy	is	the	actual	 trade 	 mark 	 	label	 with 	 in 	 	that	piece	of	 appar 	 el 	 	.
that	's	one	reason	that	you	see	 logo 	 s 	 	 s 	 plat 	 ter 	 ed 	 	all	over	these	 product 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	a	lot	 hard 	 er 	 	for	knock	-	off	 artist 	 s 	 	to	knock	off	these	 design 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	ca	n't	knock	off	the	logo	.
but	if	you	go	to	santee	 al 	 ley 	 	,	 yea 	 h 	 	.
well	,	 yea 	 h 	 	.
 can 	 al 	 	street	,	i	know	.
and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	these	are	 f 	 un 	 	,	right	?
now	,	the	reason	for	 th 	 is 	 	,	the	reason	that	the	fashion	industry	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	any	 copy 	 right 	 	 protect 	 ion 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 court 	 s 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	long	ago	that	 appar 	 el 	 	is	too	 util 	 itarian 	 	to	 qual 	 ify 	 	for	 copy 	 right 	 	 protect 	 ion 	 	.
they	did	n't	want	a	 hand 	 ful 	 	of	 design 	 ers 	 	 own 	 ing 	 	the	 semi 	 nal 	 	building	 block 	 s 	 	of	our	 cloth 	 ing 	 	.
and	then	 every 	 body 	 	else	would	have	to	 licens 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	cuff	or	 th 	 is 	 	sleeve	 be 	 cause 	 	joe	blow	 own 	 s 	 	it	.
but	too	 util 	 itarian 	 	?	i	mean	is	that	the	way	you	think	of	fashion	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	vivienne	westwood	.	no	!
we	think	of	it	 a 	 s 	 	 may 	 be 	 	too	 s 	 il 	 ly 	 	,	too	 un 	 necess 	 ary 	 	.
now	,	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	are	familiar	with	the	logic	 be 	 hind 	 	 copy 	 right 	 	 protect 	 ion 	 	--	which	is	that	 with 	 out 	 	 owner 	 ship 	 	,	there	is	no	incentive	to	 innov 	 ate 	 	--	might	be	 re 	 ally 	 	 surprise 	 d 	 	by	both	the	critical	success	of	the	fashion	industry	and	the	economic	success	of	 th 	 is 	 	industry	.
what	i	'm	going	to	 argu 	 e 	 	 to 	 day 	 	is	that	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	no	 copy 	 right 	 	 protect 	 ion 	 	in	the	fashion	industry	,	fashion	 design 	 ers 	 	have	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	 elev 	 ate 	 	 util 	 itarian 	 	design	,	 thing 	 s 	 	to	cover	our	naked	bodies	,	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	consider	art	.
 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	no	 copy 	 right 	 	 protect 	 ion 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	industry	,	there	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	open	and	creative	 eco 	 logy 	 	of	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	.
 un 	 like 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	creative	 brother 	 s 	 	and	 sister 	 s 	 	,	who	are	 sculpt 	 ors 	 	or	 photograph 	 ers 	 	or	 film 	 makers 	 	or	 music 	 ians 	 	,	fashion	 design 	 ers 	 	can	 s 	 ample 	 	from	all	 the 	 ir 	 	 peer 	 s 	 	'	 design 	 s 	 	.
they	can	take	any	element	from	any	 gar 	 ment 	 	from	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	fashion	and	 in 	 corporate 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	design	.
they	're	 al 	 so 	 	notorious	for	 riff 	 ing 	 	off	of	the	 zeitge 	 ist 	 	.
and	here	,	i	suspect	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 influence 	 d 	 	by	the	 cost 	 ume 	 s 	 	in	avatar	.
 may 	 be 	 	just	a	little	.
ca	n't	 copy 	 right 	 	a	 cost 	 ume 	 	either	.
now	,	fashion	 design 	 ers 	 	have	the	 broad 	 est 	 	 pal 	 ette 	 	 imagin 	 able 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	creative	industry	.
 th 	 is 	 	 wed 	 d 	 ing 	 	dress	here	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	made	of	sporks	,
and	 th 	 is 	 	dress	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	made	of	 a 	 lumin 	 um 	 	.
i	've	heard	 th 	 is 	 	dress	 actual 	 ly 	 	sort	of	 sound 	 s 	 	like	wind	 chime 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	walk	through	.
so	,	one	of	the	 magic 	 al 	 	side	 effect 	 s 	 	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	culture	of	 copy 	 ing 	 	,	which	is	 re 	 ally 	 	what	it	is	,	is	the	 establish 	 ment 	 	of	 trend 	 s 	 	.
people	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 magic 	 al 	 	thing	.	how	 do 	 es 	 	it	happen	?
well	,	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	legal	for	people	to	copy	one	 an 	 other 	 	.
some	people	 believ 	 e 	 	that	there	are	a	few	people	at	the	top	of	the	fashion	food	chain	who	sort	of	 dict 	 ate 	 	to	us	what	we	're	all	going	to	wear	,
but	if	you	talk	to	any	 design 	 er 	 	at	any	level	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	these	high	-	end	 design 	 ers 	 	,	they	 al 	 ways 	 	say	 the 	 ir 	 	main	inspiration	 come 	 s 	 	from	the	street	:	where	people	like	you	and	me	remix	and	match	our	own	fashion	 look 	 s 	 	.	and	that	's	where	they	 re 	 ally 	 	get	a	lot	of	 the 	 ir 	 	creative	inspiration	,
so	it	's	both	a	top	-	down	and	a	bottom	-	up	kind	of	industry	.
now	,	the	fast	fashion	 giant 	 s 	 	have	 prob 	 ably 	 	 benefit 	 ed 	 	the	most	from	the	lack	of	 copy 	 right 	 	 protect 	 ion 	 	in	the	fashion	industry	.
they	are	notorious	for	 knock 	 ing 	 	off	high	-	end	 design 	 s 	 	and	selling	them	at	 ver 	 y 	 	low	 price 	 s 	 	.
and	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	 face 	 d 	 	with	a	lot	of	 law 	 suit 	 s 	 	,	but	 t 	 hose 	 	 law 	 suit 	 s 	 	are	 usual 	 ly 	 	not	won	by	fashion	 design 	 ers 	 	.
the	 court 	 s 	 	have	 s 	 aid 	 	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	,	``	you	do	n't	need	any	more	intellectual	 proper 	 ty 	 	 protect 	 ion 	 	.	``
when	you	look	at	copies	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	wonder	:	how	do	the	 luxur 	 y 	 	high	-	end	 brand 	 s 	 	remain	in	business	?
if	you	can	get	it	for	200	 buck 	 s 	 	,	why	pay	a	thousand	?
well	,	that	's	one	reason	we	had	a	 con 	 ference 	 	here	at	usc	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
we	 invit 	 ed 	 	tom	ford	to	come	--
the	 con 	 ference 	 	was	 call 	 ed 	 	,	``	ready	to	share	:	fashion	and	the	 owner 	 ship 	 	of	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	``	--
and	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	him	 exact 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	question	.
here	's	what	he	had	to	say	.
he	had	just	come	off	a	 success 	 ful 	 	 s 	 tin 	 t 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	lead	 design 	 er 	 	at	gucci	,	in	case	you	did	n't	know	.
tom	ford	:	and	we	found	after	much	research	that	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	not	much	research	,	 quit 	 e 	 	simple	research	--	that	the	 counter 	 fe 	 it 	 	 custom 	 er 	 	was	not	our	 custom 	 er 	 	.
the	people	on	santee	 al 	 ley 	 	are	not	the	 one 	 s 	 	who	shop	at	gucci	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	 demo 	 graphic 	 	.
and	,	you	know	,	a	knock	-	off	is	never	the	same	 a 	 s 	 	an	original	high	-	end	design	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	 material 	 s 	 	;	they	're	 al 	 ways 	 	made	of	 cheap 	 er 	 	 material 	 s 	 	.
but	even	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	a	 cheap 	 er 	 	version	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	some	 charm 	 ing 	 	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	,	can	breathe	a	little	extra	life	 in 	 to 	 	a	 dy 	 ing 	 	trend	.
there	's	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 virtue 	 s 	 	of	 copy 	 ing 	 	.
one	that	a	lot	of	cultural	 critic 	 s 	 	have	 point 	 ed 	 	to	is	that	we	now	have	a	much	 broad 	 er 	 	 pal 	 ette 	 	of	design	 choice 	 s 	 	to	 choos 	 e 	 	from	than	we	ever	have	before	,
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 main 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	fast	fashion	industry	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	good	thing	.	we	need	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 option 	 s 	 	.
fashion	,	 whet 	 her 	 	you	like	it	or	not	,	 help 	 s 	 	you	project	who	you	are	to	the	world	.
 be 	 cause 	 	of	fast	fashion	,	global	 trend 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	 establish 	 ed 	 	much	more	 quick 	 ly 	 	than	they	used	to	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	is	good	news	to	 trend 	 setter 	 s 	 	;
they	want	 trend 	 s 	 	to	be	set	so	that	they	can	move	product	.
for	 fashion 	 ista 	 s 	 	,	they	want	to	stay	 a 	 head 	 	of	the	 curv 	 e 	 	.
they	do	n't	want	to	be	 wear 	 ing 	 	what	 every 	 body 	 	else	is	 wear 	 ing 	 	.
and	so	,	they	want	to	move	on	to	the	next	trend	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	possible	.
i	tell	you	,	there	is	no	rest	for	the	 fashion 	 able 	 	.
every	season	,	these	 design 	 ers 	 	have	to	struggle	to	come	up	with	the	new	fabulous	idea	that	 every 	 body 	 	's	going	to	love	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	,	let	me	tell	you	,	is	 ver 	 y 	 	good	for	the	bottom	line	.
now	of	course	,	there	's	a	bunch	of	 effect 	 s 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	culture	of	 copy 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	on	the	creative	process	.
and	stuart	weitzman	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	shoe	 design 	 er 	 	.
he	 ha 	 s 	 	 complain 	 ed 	 	a	lot	about	people	 copy 	 ing 	 	him	,
but	in	one	interview	i	read	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 force 	 d 	 	him	to	up	his	game	.
he	had	to	come	up	with	new	 idea 	 s 	 	,	new	 thing 	 s 	 	that	would	be	hard	to	copy	.
he	came	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	bowden	-	wedge	heel	that	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	made	out	of	steel	or	 titan 	 ium 	 	;
if	you	make	it	from	some	sort	of	 cheap 	 er 	 	material	,	it	'll	 actual 	 ly 	 	crack	in	two	.
it	 force 	 d 	 	him	to	be	a	little	more	 innov 	 ative 	 	.
and	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 re 	 minded 	 	me	of	jazz	great	,	charlie	parker	.
i	do	n't	know	if	you	've	heard	 th 	 is 	 	anecdote	,	but	i	have	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	that	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	he	 invent 	 ed 	 	bebop	was	that	he	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	that	white	 music 	 ians 	 	would	n't	be	able	to	replicate	the	sound	.
he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	make	it	too	difficult	to	copy	,
and	that	's	what	fashion	 design 	 ers 	 	are	 do 	 ing 	 	all	the	time	.
they	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	put	together	a	signature	look	,	an	aesthetic	that	 reflect 	 s 	 	who	they	are	.
when	people	knock	it	off	,	 every 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	've	put	that	look	out	on	the	 run 	 way 	 	,	and	it	's	a	 cohere 	 nt 	 	aesthetic	.
i	love	these	gallianos	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	we	'll	move	on	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 un 	 like 	 	the	world	of	 come 	 dy 	 	.
i	do	n't	know	if	you	know	that	 joke 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	ca	n't	be	 copy 	 right 	 	 protect 	 ed 	 	.
so	when	one	-	 liner 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	popular	,	 every 	 body 	 	stole	them	from	one	 an 	 other 	 	.
but	now	,	we	have	a	different	kind	of	 com 	 ic 	 	.
they	develop	a	 person 	 a 	 	,	a	signature	style	,	much	like	fashion	 design 	 ers 	 	.
and	 the 	 ir 	 	 joke 	 s 	 	,	much	like	the	fashion	 design 	 s 	 	by	a	fashion	 design 	 er 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	work	 with 	 in 	 	that	aesthetic	.
if	 some 	 body 	 	 steal 	 s 	 	a	joke	from	larry	david	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	it	's	not	 a 	 s 	 	funny	.
now	,	the	other	thing	that	fashion	 design 	 ers 	 	have	 d 	 one 	 	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	culture	of	 copy 	 ing 	 	is	they	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	how	to	copy	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
they	knock	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	off	.
they	make	 deal 	 s 	 	with	the	fast	fashion	 giant 	 s 	 	and	they	come	up	with	a	way	to	sell	 the 	 ir 	 	product	to	a	whole	new	 demo 	 graphic 	 	:	the	santee	 al 	 ley 	 	 demo 	 graphic 	 	.
now	,	some	fashion	 design 	 ers 	 	will	say	,	``	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	that	we	do	n't	have	any	respect	.
in	other	 count 	 ries 	 	there	is	 protect 	 ion 	 	for	our	 art 	 ful 	 	 design 	 s 	 	.	``
but	if	you	take	a	look	at	the	two	other	 big 	 gest 	 	 market 	 s 	 	in	the	world	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	the	 protect 	 ion 	 	that	's	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 ine 	 ffectual 	 	.
in	japan	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	which	i	think	is	the	third	largest	market	,	they	have	a	design	law	;	it	 protect 	 s 	 	 appar 	 el 	 	,	but	the	 novel 	 ty 	 	standard	is	so	high	,	you	have	to	prove	that	your	 gar 	 ment 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	never	 exist 	 ed 	 	before	,
it	's	 total 	 ly 	 	 un 	 ique 	 	.
and	that	's	sort	of	like	the	 novel 	 ty 	 	standard	for	a	u.s.	patent	,	which	fashion	 design 	 ers 	 	never	get	--	 rare 	 ly 	 	get	here	in	the	 state 	 s 	 	.
in	the	european	 un 	 ion 	 	,	they	went	in	the	other	direction	.
 ver 	 y 	 	low	 novel 	 ty 	 	standard	,	 any 	 body 	 	can	register	 any 	 thing 	 	.
but	even	 th 	 ough 	 	it	's	the	home	of	the	fast	fashion	industry	and	you	have	a	lot	of	 luxur 	 y 	 	 design 	 ers 	 	there	,	they	do	n't	register	 the 	 ir 	 	 gar 	 ments 	 	,	 general 	 ly 	 	,	and	there	's	not	a	lot	of	 litig 	 ation 	 	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 novel 	 ty 	 	standard	is	too	low	.
a	person	can	come	in	and	take	 some 	 body 	 	else	's	gown	,	cut	off	three	 inch 	 es 	 	from	the	bottom	,	go	to	the	e.u	.	and	register	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	new	,	original	design	.
so	,	that	 do 	 es 	 	not	stop	the	knock	-	off	 artist 	 s 	 	.
if	you	look	at	the	 registr 	 y 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	a	lot	of	the	 register 	 ed 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	in	the	e.u	.	are	nike	t	-	 shirt 	 s 	 	that	are	 al 	 most 	 	 ident 	 ical 	 	to	one	 an 	 other 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 stop 	 ped 	 	diane	von	furstenberg	.
she	is	the	head	of	the	council	of	fashion	 design 	 ers 	 	of	america	,	and	she	 ha 	 s 	 	told	her	 constit 	 uency 	 	that	she	is	going	to	get	 copy 	 right 	 	 protect 	 ion 	 	for	fashion	 design 	 s 	 	.
the	 re 	 tail 	 ers 	 	have	kind	of	quashed	 th 	 is 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	.
i	do	n't	think	the	 legisl 	 ation 	 	is	going	 any 	 where 	 	,
 be 	 cause 	 	they	 real 	 ized 	 	it	is	so	hard	to	tell	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	a	 pirate 	 d 	 	design	and	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	just	part	of	a	global	trend	.
who	 own 	 s 	 	a	look	?
that	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	question	to	answer	.
it	 take 	 s 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 lawyer 	 s 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	court	time	,
and	the	 re 	 tail 	 ers 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	that	would	be	way	too	expensive	.
you	know	,	it	's	not	just	the	fashion	industry	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	 copy 	 right 	 	 protect 	 ion 	 	.
there	's	a	bunch	of	other	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	that	do	n't	have	 copy 	 right 	 	 protect 	 ion 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	the	food	industry	.
you	can	not	 copy 	 right 	 	a	recipe	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	a	set	of	 instruct 	 ions 	 	,	it	's	fact	,
and	you	can	not	 copy 	 right 	 	the	look	and	feel	of	even	the	most	 un 	 ique 	 	dish	.
same	with	 auto 	 mobile 	 s 	 	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	how	 wack 	 y 	 	they	look	or	how	cool	they	look	,	you	can	not	 copy 	 right 	 	the	 sculpt 	 ural 	 	design	.
it	's	a	 util 	 itarian 	 	article	,	that	's	why	.
same	with	furniture	,
it	's	too	 util 	 itarian 	 	.
magic	 trick 	 s 	 	,	i	think	they	're	 instruct 	 ions 	 	,	sort	of	like	 recipe 	 s 	 	:
no	 copy 	 right 	 	 protect 	 ion 	 	.
hairdos	,	no	 copy 	 right 	 	 protect 	 ion 	 	.
open	source	 soft 	 ware 	 	,	these	 guy 	 s 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	they	did	n't	want	 copy 	 right 	 	 protect 	 ion 	 	.
they	thought	it	'd	be	more	 innov 	 ative 	 	 with 	 out 	 	it	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	to	get	 copy 	 right 	 	for	 data 	 base 	 s 	 	.
tattoo	 artist 	 s 	 	,	they	do	n't	want	it	;	it	's	not	cool	.
they	share	 the 	 ir 	 	 design 	 s 	 	.
 joke 	 s 	 	,	no	 copy 	 right 	 	 protect 	 ion 	 	.
 fire 	 work 	 s 	 	 dis 	 play 	 s 	 	,
the	 rule 	 s 	 	of	 game 	 s 	 	,
the	smell	of	perfume	:	no	.
and	some	of	these	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	may	seem	sort	of	marginal	to	you	,	but	these	are	the	gross	 sale 	 s 	 	for	low	i.p	.	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	,	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	with	 ver 	 y 	 	little	 copy 	 right 	 	 protect 	 ion 	 	,
and	there	's	the	gross	 sale 	 s 	 	of	 film 	 s 	 	and	 book 	 s 	 	.
it	ai	n't	 pre 	 tty 	 	.
so	you	talk	to	people	in	the	fashion	industry	and	they	're	like	,	``	shhh	!
do	n't	tell	 any 	 body 	 	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	steal	from	each	other	's	 design 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 embarrass 	 ing 	 	.	``
but	you	know	what	?	it	's	 revolution 	 ary 	 	,
and	it	's	a	model	that	a	lot	of	other	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	--	like	the	 one 	 s 	 	we	just	saw	with	the	 re 	 ally 	 	small	 bar 	 s 	 	--	they	might	have	to	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	.	 be 	 cause 	 	right	now	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	with	a	lot	of	 copy 	 right 	 	 protect 	 ion 	 	are	 oper 	 ating 	 	in	an	atmosphere	where	it	's	 a 	 s 	 	if	they	do	n't	have	any	 protect 	 ion 	 	,
and	they	do	n't	know	what	to	do	.
when	i	found	out	that	there	are	a	whole	bunch	of	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	that	did	n't	have	 copy 	 right 	 	 protect 	 ion 	 	,	i	thought	,	``	what	 exact 	 ly 	 	is	the	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	logic	?
i	want	a	picture	.	``	and	the	 lawyer 	 s 	 	do	not	provide	a	picture	,
so	i	made	one	.
these	are	the	two	main	sort	of	 bin 	 ary 	 	 op 	 position 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	logic	of	 copy 	 right 	 	law	.
it	is	more	complex	than	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	will	do	.
first	:	is	 some 	 thing 	 	an	 art 	 istic 	 	object	?
then	it	 deserve 	 s 	 	 protect 	 ion 	 	.
is	it	a	 util 	 itarian 	 	object	?
then	no	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	not	deserve	 protect 	 ion 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	difficult	,	 un 	 s 	 table 	 	 bin 	 ary 	 	.
the	other	one	is	:	is	it	an	idea	?
is	it	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 need 	 s 	 	to	 free 	 ly 	 	 circul 	 ate 	 	in	a	free	 socie 	 ty 	 	?
no	 protect 	 ion 	 	.
or	is	it	a	 physical 	 ly 	 	 fix 	 ed 	 	 express 	 ion 	 	of	an	idea	:	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 some 	 body 	 	made	and	they	deserve	to	own	it	for	a	while	and	make	money	from	it	?
the	problem	is	that	digital	technology	 ha 	 s 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	 sub 	 vert 	 ed 	 	the	logic	of	 th 	 is 	 	 physical 	 ly 	 	 fix 	 ed 	 	,	 express 	 ion 	 	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	idea	 con 	 cept 	 	.
 now 	 a 	 day 	 s 	 	,	we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 recogn 	 ize 	 	a	book	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	on	our	shelf	or	music	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	a	physical	object	that	we	can	hold	.
it	's	a	digital	file	.
it	is	 bare 	 ly 	 	 tether 	 ed 	 	to	any	sort	of	physical	 re 	 ality 	 	in	our	 mind 	 s 	 	.
and	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	can	copy	and	transmit	them	so	 eas 	 ily 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	 circul 	 ate 	 	 with 	 in 	 	our	culture	a	lot	more	like	 idea 	 s 	 	than	like	 physical 	 ly 	 	 instant 	 iated 	 	 object 	 s 	 	.
now	,	the	conceptual	 issue 	 s 	 	are	 tru 	 ly 	 	 pro 	 found 	 	when	you	talk	about	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	and	 owner 	 ship 	 	and	,	let	me	tell	you	,	we	do	n't	want	to	 leav 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	just	to	 lawyer 	 s 	 	to	figure	out	.
they	're	smart	.
i	'm	with	one	.	he	's	my	boyfriend	,	he	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
he	's	smart	,	he	's	smart	.
but	you	want	an	 inter 	 disciplinary 	 	team	of	people	 hash 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	out	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	:	what	is	the	kind	of	 owner 	 ship 	 	model	,	in	a	digital	world	,	that	's	going	to	lead	to	the	most	 innov 	 ation 	 	?
and	my	 suggest 	 ion 	 	is	that	fashion	might	be	a	 re 	 ally 	 	good	place	to	start	looking	for	a	model	for	creative	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	in	the	future	.
if	you	want	more	information	about	 th 	 is 	 	research	project	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	visit	our	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	:	it	's	readytoshare.org	.	and	i	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	thank	veronica	jauriqui	for	making	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 fashion 	 able 	 	 present 	 ation 	 	.
thank	you	so	much	.
