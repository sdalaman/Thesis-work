it	 s 	 ure 	 	used	to	be	a	lot	 eas 	 ier 	 	to	be	from	iceland	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 un 	 til 	 	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	people	 k 	 new 	 	 hard 	 ly 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	about	us	,	and	i	could	 bas 	 ically 	 	come	out	here	and	say	 on 	 ly 	 	good	 thing 	 s 	 	about	us	.
but	in	the	last	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	we	've	 be 	 come 	 	 in 	 famous 	 	for	a	couple	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
first	,	of	course	,	the	economic	 melt 	 down 	 	.
it	 actual 	 ly 	 	got	so	bad	that	 some 	 body 	 	put	our	country	up	for	sale	on	ebay	.
ninety	-	nine	 p 	 ence 	 	was	the	 start 	 ing 	 	price	and	no	 re 	 serve 	 	.
then	there	was	the	 volcan 	 o 	 	that	 interrupt 	 ed 	 	the	travel	 plan 	 s 	 	of	 al 	 most 	 	all	of	you	and	 man 	 y 	 	of	your	 friend 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 p 	 resident 	 	obama	.
by	the	way	,	the	 pro 	 nunci 	 ation 	 	is	``	eyjafjallajokull	.	``
 non 	 e 	 	of	your	media	got	it	right	.
but	i	'm	not	here	to	share	these	 st 	 ories 	 	about	these	two	 thing 	 s 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	.	i	'm	here	to	tell	you	the	story	of	audur	capital	,	which	is	a	financial	firm	 found 	 ed 	 	by	me	and	kristin	--	who	you	see	in	the	picture	--	in	the	spring	of	2007	,	just	over	a	year	before	the	economic	collapse	hit	.
why	would	two	women	who	 we 	 re 	 	 enjoy 	 ing 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	 care 	 ers 	 	in	 invest 	 ment 	 	 bank 	 ing 	 	in	the	corporate	sector	 leav 	 e 	 	to	found	a	financial	 service 	 s 	 	firm	?
well	let	it	 suff 	 ice 	 	to	say	that	we	felt	a	bit	 overwhelm 	 ed 	 	with	testosterone	.
and	i	'm	not	here	to	say	that	men	are	to	blame	for	the	crisis	and	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	my	country	.
but	i	can	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	tell	you	that	in	my	country	,	much	like	on	wall	street	and	the	city	of	london	and	 else 	 where 	 	,	men	 we 	 re 	 	at	the	helm	of	the	game	of	the	financial	sector	,
and	that	kind	of	lack	of	 divers 	 ity 	 	and	 same 	 ness 	 	 lead 	 s 	 	to	 dis 	 astro 	 us 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	.
so	we	 decide 	 d 	 	,	a	bit	fed	-	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	world	and	 al 	 so 	 	with	the	strong	 feel 	 ing 	 	in	our	stomach	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	n't	 sustain 	 able 	 	,	to	found	a	financial	 service 	 s 	 	firm	based	on	our	 value 	 s 	 	,
and	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	 in 	 corporate 	 	 femin 	 ine 	 	 value 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	world	of	finance	.
raised	 quit 	 e 	 	a	few	 eye 	 brow 	 s 	 	in	iceland	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	n't	known	 a 	 s 	 	the	typical	``	women	``	women	in	iceland	up	 un 	 til 	 	then	.
so	it	was	 al 	 most 	 	like	coming	out	of	the	 close 	 t 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	talk	about	the	fact	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	women	and	that	we	 believ 	 ed 	 	that	we	had	a	set	of	 value 	 s 	 	and	a	way	of	 do 	 ing 	 	business	that	would	be	more	 sustain 	 able 	 	than	what	we	had	 experience 	 d 	 	 un 	 til 	 	then	.
and	we	got	a	great	group	of	people	to	join	us	--	 principle 	 d 	 	people	with	great	 skill 	 s 	 	,	and	 invest 	 ors 	 	with	a	vision	and	 value 	 s 	 	to	match	 our 	 s 	 	.
and	together	we	got	through	the	eye	of	the	financial	storm	in	iceland	 with 	 out 	 	taking	any	direct	 loss 	 es 	 	to	our	 equ 	 ity 	 	or	to	the	 fund 	 s 	 	of	our	 client 	 s 	 	.
and	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	i	want	to	thank	the	 talent 	 ed 	 	people	of	our	company	 fore 	 most 	 	for	that	--	and	 al 	 so 	 	there	's	a	factor	of	luck	and	 tim 	 ing 	 	--	we	are	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	that	we	did	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	our	 value 	 s 	 	.
so	let	me	share	with	you	our	 value 	 s 	 	.
we	 believ 	 e 	 	in	risk	 aware 	 ness 	 	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	?
we	 believ 	 e 	 	that	you	should	 al 	 ways 	 	understand	the	 risk 	 s 	 	that	you	're	taking	,	and	we	will	not	invest	in	 thing 	 s 	 	we	do	n't	understand	.
not	a	 complic 	 ated 	 	thing	.
but	in	2007	,	at	the	height	of	the	sub	-	prime	and	all	the	 complic 	 ated 	 	financial	 structure 	 s 	 	,	it	was	 quit 	 e 	 	 oppos 	 ite 	 	to	the	reckless	risk	-	taking	 behavior 	 s 	 	that	we	saw	on	the	market	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	in	straight	-	 talk 	 ing 	 	,	 tell 	 ing 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	,	using	simple	language	that	people	understand	,	 tell 	 ing 	 	people	about	the	 down 	 side 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	the	potential	 up 	 side 	 s 	 	,	and	even	 tell 	 ing 	 	the	bad	news	that	no	one	 want 	 s 	 	to	utter	,	like	our	lack	of	belief	in	the	 sustain 	 ability 	 	of	the	icelandic	financial	sector	that	 al 	 ready 	 	we	had	 month 	 s 	 	before	the	collapse	hit	us	.
and	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	we	do	work	in	the	financial	sector	,	where	excel	is	king	,	we	 believ 	 e 	 	in	 emotion 	 al 	 	capital	.
and	we	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 do 	 ing 	 	 emotion 	 al 	 	due	 di 	 lig 	 ence 	 	is	just	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	financial	due	 di 	 lig 	 ence 	 	.
it	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	people	that	make	money	and	lose	money	,	not	excel	 spread 	 sheet 	 s 	 	.	last	,	but	not	 l 	 east 	 	,	we	 believ 	 e 	 	in	profit	with	 principle 	 s 	 	.	we	care	how	we	make	our	profit	.	so	while	we	want	to	make	economic	profit	for	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	our	 custom 	 ers 	 	,	we	are	 will 	 ing 	 	to	do	it	with	a	long	-	term	view	,
and	we	like	to	have	a	 wide 	 r 	 	definition	of	 profit 	 s 	 	than	just	the	economic	profit	in	the	next	quarter	.
so	we	like	to	see	 profit 	 s 	 	,	plus	positive	social	and	 environment 	 al 	 	 benefit 	 s 	 	,	when	we	invest	.
but	it	was	n't	just	about	the	 value 	 s 	 	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	we	are	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	that	they	matter	.
it	was	 al 	 so 	 	about	a	business	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
it	's	the	female	trend	,	and	it	's	the	 sustain 	 ability 	 	trend	,	that	are	going	to	create	some	of	the	most	 interest 	 ing 	 	 invest 	 ment 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	in	the	 year 	 s 	 	to	come	.
the	whole	thing	about	the	female	trend	is	not	about	women	 be 	 ing 	 	better	than	men	;	it	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	about	women	 be 	 ing 	 	different	from	men	,	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	different	 value 	 s 	 	and	different	ways	to	the	table	.
so	what	do	you	get	?	you	get	better	decision	-	making	,
and	you	get	less	herd	behavior	,
and	both	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	hit	your	bottom	line	with	 ver 	 y 	 	positive	 result 	 s 	 	.
but	one	 ha 	 s 	 	to	wonder	,	now	that	we	've	had	 th 	 is 	 	financial	sector	collapse	 up 	 on 	 	us	in	iceland	--	and	by	the	way	,	europe	 look 	 s 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	bad	right	now	,
and	 man 	 y 	 	would	say	that	you	in	america	are	 head 	 ing 	 	for	some	more	trouble	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
now	that	we	've	had	all	that	happen	,	and	we	have	all	 th 	 is 	 	data	out	there	 tell 	 ing 	 	us	that	it	's	much	better	to	have	 divers 	 ity 	 	around	the	decision	-	making	 table 	 s 	 	,	will	we	see	business	and	finance	change	?
will	government	change	?
well	i	'll	give	you	my	straight	talk	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	have	 day 	 s 	 	that	i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	but	i	have	 day 	 s 	 	that	i	'm	full	of	doubt	.
have	you	 s 	 een 	 	the	 in 	 credible 	 	urge	out	there	to	 re 	 build 	 	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 fail 	 ed 	 	us	?
einstein	 s 	 aid 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	definition	of	 insan 	 ity 	 	--	to	do	the	same	 thing 	 s 	 	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 hop 	 ing 	 	for	a	different	 out 	 come 	 	.
so	i	guess	the	world	is	 insan 	 e 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	see	 entire 	 ly 	 	too	much	of	 do 	 ing 	 	the	same	 thing 	 s 	 	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 hop 	 ing 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	time	it	's	not	going	to	collapse	 up 	 on 	 	us	.
i	want	to	see	more	 revolution 	 ary 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	,
and	i	remain	 hope 	 ful 	 	.
like	ted	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	in	people	.
and	i	know	that	 consumer 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 coming 	 	more	conscious	,	and	they	are	going	to	start	 vot 	 ing 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 wallet 	 s 	 	,	and	they	are	going	to	change	the	face	of	business	and	finance	from	the	 out 	 side 	 	,	if	they	do	n't	do	it	from	the	 in 	 side 	 	.
but	i	'm	more	of	the	 revolution 	 ary 	 	,	and	i	should	be	;	i	'm	from	iceland	.
we	have	a	long	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	strong	,	 courage 	 ous 	 	,	 in 	 dependent 	 	women	,	ever	since	the	viking	age	.
and	i	want	to	tell	you	when	i	first	 real 	 ized 	 	that	women	matter	to	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	and	to	the	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	i	was	seven	--	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	be	my	mother	's	 birth 	 day 	 	--	october	24	,	1975	.
women	in	iceland	took	the	day	off	.
from	work	or	from	home	,	they	took	the	day	off	,	and	 noth 	 ing 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	in	iceland	.
they	 march 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	center	of	reykjavik	,	and	they	put	women	's	 issue 	 s 	 	onto	the	agenda	.
and	some	say	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	start	of	a	global	 move 	 ment 	 	.
for	me	it	was	the	start	of	a	long	journey	,	but	i	 decide 	 d 	 	that	day	to	matter	.
five	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	iceland	 elect 	 ed 	 	vigdis	finnbogadottir	 a 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 p 	 resident 	 	--	first	female	to	 be 	 come 	 	head	of	state	,	single	mom	,	a	breast	cancer	 surviv 	 or 	 	who	had	had	one	of	her	 breast 	 s 	 	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	.
and	at	one	of	the	campaign	 session 	 s 	 	,	she	had	one	of	her	male	 con 	 tender 	 s 	 	 al 	 lude 	 	to	the	fact	that	she	could	n't	 be 	 come 	 	 p 	 resident 	 	--	she	was	a	woman	,	and	even	half	a	woman	.
that	night	she	won	the	election	,	 be 	 cause 	 	she	came	back	--	not	just	 be 	 cause 	 	of	his	 crap 	 py 	 	behavior	--	but	she	came	back	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	i	'm	 actual 	 ly 	 	not	going	to	 breast 	 feed 	 	the	icelandic	nation	;	i	'm	going	to	lead	it	.	``
so	i	've	had	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 man 	 y 	 	women	role	 model 	 s 	 	that	have	 influence 	 d 	 	who	i	am	and	where	i	am	 to 	 day 	 	.
but	in	spite	of	that	,	i	went	through	the	first	10	or	15	 year 	 s 	 	of	my	 care 	 er 	 	 most 	 ly 	 	in	 deni 	 al 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	a	woman	.
 start 	 ed 	 	in	corporate	america	,	and	i	was	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	that	it	was	just	about	the	individual	,	that	women	and	men	would	have	just	the	same	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	.
but	i	've	come	to	conclude	 late 	 ly 	 	that	it	is	n't	like	that	.
we	are	not	the	same	,
and	it	's	great	.	 be 	 cause 	 	of	our	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	,	we	create	and	sustain	life	.
so	we	should	embrace	our	 differ 	 ence 	 	and	aim	for	 challeng 	 e 	 	.	the	final	thought	i	want	to	 leav 	 e 	 	with	you	is	that	i	'm	fed	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	 tyrann 	 y 	 	of	either	/	or	 choice 	 s 	 	in	life	--	either	it	's	men	or	it	's	women	.
we	need	to	start	 em 	 bracing 	 	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	of	balance	.
so	let	's	move	away	from	 think 	 ing 	 	about	business	here	and	 philanthro 	 py 	 	there	,	and	let	's	start	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 do 	 ing 	 	good	business	.
that	's	how	we	change	the	world	.	that	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 sustain 	 able 	 	future	.
thank	you	.
