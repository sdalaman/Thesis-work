have	you	ever	 wonder 	 ed 	 	why	 extrem 	 ism 	 	 seem 	 s 	 	to	have	 be 	 en 	 	on	the	rise	in	muslim	-	 major 	 ity 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	over	the	course	of	the	last	decade	?
have	you	ever	 wonder 	 ed 	 	how	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	can	be	 turn 	 ed 	 	around	?
have	you	ever	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	arab	 up 	 ris 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	thought	,	``	how	could	we	have	 predict 	 ed 	 	that	?	``	or	``	how	could	we	have	better	prepared	for	that	?	``	well	my	personal	story	,	my	personal	journey	,	what	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	me	to	the	ted	stage	here	 to 	 day 	 	,	is	a	 demonst 	 ration 	 	of	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	's	 be 	 en 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	muslim	-	 major 	 ity 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	over	the	course	of	the	last	 decade 	 s 	 	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	,	and	beyond	.
i	want	to	share	some	of	that	story	with	you	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	some	of	my	 idea 	 s 	 	around	change	and	the	role	of	social	 move 	 ments 	 	in	creating	change	in	muslim	-	 major 	 ity 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	.
so	let	me	begin	by	first	of	all	giving	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	brief	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	time	,	if	i	may	indulge	.
in	 med 	 ieval 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	there	 we 	 re 	 	defined	 allegiance 	 s 	 	.
an	 ident 	 ity 	 	was	defined	 prim 	 arily 	 	by	 relig 	 ion 	 	.
and	then	we	 move 	 d 	 	on	 in 	 to 	 	an	era	in	the	19th	century	with	the	rise	of	a	european	nation	-	state	where	 ident 	 ities 	 	and	 allegiance 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	defined	by	 ethnic 	 ity 	 	.
so	 ident 	 ity 	 	was	 prim 	 arily 	 	defined	by	 ethnic 	 ity 	 	,	and	the	nation	-	state	 reflect 	 ed 	 	that	.
in	the	age	of	 global 	 ization 	 	,	we	 move 	 d 	 	on	.
i	call	it	the	era	of	 citizen 	 ship 	 	--	where	people	could	be	from	multi	-	racial	,	multi	-	ethnic	 back 	 ground 	 s 	 	,	but	all	be	equal	 a 	 s 	 	 citizen 	 s 	 	in	a	state	.
you	could	be	american	-	italian	;	you	could	be	american	-	irish	;	you	could	be	british	-	pakistani	.
but	i	 believ 	 e 	 	now	that	we	're	moving	 in 	 to 	 	a	new	age	,	and	that	age	the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	 dub 	 bed 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	``	the	age	of	behavior	.	``	how	i	define	the	age	of	behavior	is	a	period	of	 trans 	 national 	 	 allegiance 	 s 	 	,	where	 ident 	 ity 	 	is	defined	more	so	by	 idea 	 s 	 	and	 narrative 	 s 	 	.
and	these	 idea 	 s 	 	and	 narrative 	 s 	 	that	bump	people	 a 	 cross 	 	 border 	 s 	 	are	 increasing 	 ly 	 	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	affect	the	way	in	which	people	 behav 	 e 	 	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	all	 necess 	 arily 	 	good	news	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	my	belief	that	hatred	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	global	just	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	love	.
but	 actual 	 ly 	 	it	's	my	belief	that	the	people	who	've	 be 	 en 	 	 tru 	 ly 	 	 capital 	 izing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	age	of	behavior	,	up	 un 	 til 	 	now	,	up	 un 	 til 	 	 re 	 cent 	 	 time 	 s 	 	,	up	 un 	 til 	 	the	last	six	 month 	 s 	 	,	the	people	who	have	 be 	 en 	 	 capital 	 izing 	 	most	on	the	age	of	behavior	and	the	 trans 	 national 	 	 allegiance 	 s 	 	,	using	digital	 activ 	 ism 	 	and	other	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 border 	 less 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	who	've	 be 	 en 	 	 benefit 	 ing 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 extrem 	 ists 	 	.
and	that	's	 some 	 thing 	 	which	i	'd	like	to	elaborate	on	.
if	we	look	at	islamists	,	if	we	look	at	the	 phenomen 	 on 	 	of	far	-	right	 fasci 	 st 	 s 	 	,	one	thing	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	good	at	,	one	thing	that	they	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 exceed 	 ing 	 	in	,	is	 commun 	 ic 	 ating 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	 border 	 s 	 	,	using	 techno 	 logies 	 	to	organize	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	to	 propag 	 ate 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 mess 	 age 	 	and	to	create	 tru 	 ly 	 	global	 phenomen 	 a 	 	.
now	i	should	know	,	 be 	 cause 	 	for	13	 year 	 s 	 	of	my	life	,	i	was	 involve 	 d 	 	in	an	 extrem 	 e 	 	islamist	 organ 	 ization 	 	.
and	i	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	potent	force	in	 spread 	 ing 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	 border 	 s 	 	,
and	i	 witness 	 ed 	 	the	rise	of	islamist	 extrem 	 ism 	 	 a 	 s 	 	distinct	from	islam	the	faith	,	and	the	way	in	which	it	 influence 	 d 	 	my	co	-	religionists	 a 	 cross 	 	the	world	.
and	my	story	,	my	personal	story	,	is	 tru 	 ly 	 	evidence	for	the	age	of	behavior	that	i	'm	 attempt 	 ing 	 	to	elaborate	 up 	 on 	 	here	.
i	was	,	by	the	way	--	i	'm	an	essex	lad	,	born	and	raised	in	essex	in	the	u.k	.
 any 	 one 	 	who	's	from	england	 know 	 s 	 	the	reputation	we	have	from	essex	.
but	 hav 	 ing 	 	 be 	 en 	 	born	in	essex	,	at	the	age	of	16	,	i	 join 	 ed 	 	an	 organ 	 ization 	 	.
at	the	age	of	17	,	i	was	 recruit 	 ing 	 	people	from	cambridge	university	to	 th 	 is 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	.
at	the	age	of	19	,	i	was	on	the	national	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	in	the	u.k	.
at	the	age	of	21	,	i	was	co	-	 found 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	in	pakistan	.
at	the	age	of	22	,	i	was	co	-	 found 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	in	denmark	.
by	the	age	of	24	,	i	found	 my 	 self 	 	 convict 	 ed 	 	in	 pri 	 son 	 	in	egypt	,	 be 	 ing 	 	 black 	 list 	 ed 	 	from	three	 count 	 ries 	 	in	the	world	for	 attempt 	 ing 	 	to	 over 	 throw 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 government 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 ing 	 	 subject 	 ed 	 	to	torture	in	egyptian	 jail 	 s 	 	and	 sentence 	 d 	 	to	five	 year 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	prisoner	of	 con 	 science 	 	.
now	that	journey	,	and	what	took	me	from	essex	all	the	way	 a 	 cross 	 	the	world	--	by	the	way	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 laugh 	 ing 	 	at	 democrat 	 ic 	 	 activist 	 s 	 	.
we	felt	they	 we 	 re 	 	from	the	age	of	 yester 	 year 	 	.
we	felt	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	out	of	date	.
i	 learn 	 ed 	 	how	to	use	email	from	the	 extrem 	 ist 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	that	i	used	.
i	 learn 	 ed 	 	how	to	 effective 	 ly 	 	communicate	 a 	 cross 	 	 border 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 detect 	 ed 	 	.
 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	i	was	 detect 	 ed 	 	,	of	course	,	in	egypt	.
but	the	way	in	which	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	to	use	technology	to	my	advantage	was	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	 with 	 in 	 	an	 extrem 	 ist 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	that	was	 force 	 d 	 	to	think	beyond	the	 con 	 fine 	 s 	 	of	the	nation	-	state	.
the	age	of	behavior	:	where	 idea 	 s 	 	and	 narrative 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 increasing 	 ly 	 	 defi 	 ning 	 	behavior	and	 ident 	 ity 	 	and	 allegiance 	 s 	 	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	we	 look 	 ed 	 	to	the	 stat 	 us 	 	quo	and	 ridicul 	 ed 	 	it	.
and	it	's	not	just	islamist	 extrem 	 ists 	 	that	did	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	even	if	you	look	 a 	 cross 	 	the	mood	music	in	europe	of	late	,	far	-	right	 fasci 	 sm 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	on	the	rise	.
a	form	of	anti	-	islam	rhetoric	is	 al 	 so 	 	on	the	rise	and	it	's	 trans 	 national 	 	.
and	the	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	 hav 	 ing 	 	is	that	it	's	 affect 	 ing 	 	the	 politic 	 al 	 	climate	 a 	 cross 	 	europe	.
what	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	is	that	what	 we 	 re 	 	 previous 	 ly 	 	 local 	 ized 	 	 parochial 	 ism 	 s 	 	,	individual	or	 group 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	 extrem 	 ists 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	 isolate 	 d 	 	from	one	 an 	 other 	 	,	have	 be 	 come 	 	 interconnect 	 ed 	 	in	a	 global 	 ized 	 	way	and	have	thus	 be 	 come 	 	,	or	are	 be 	 coming 	 	,	 main 	 stream 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	 inter 	 net 	 	and	 connect 	 ion 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	are	 connect 	 ing 	 	them	 a 	 cross 	 	the	world	.
if	you	look	at	the	rise	of	far	-	right	 fasci 	 sm 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	europe	of	late	,	you	will	see	some	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 happen 	 ing 	 	that	are	 in 	 flu 	 encing 	 	domestic	 politic 	 s 	 	,	yet	the	 phenomen 	 on 	 	is	 trans 	 national 	 	.
in	certain	 count 	 ries 	 	,	mosque	 minaret 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 bann 	 ed 	 	.
in	 other 	 s 	 	,	 head 	 s 	 carve 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 bann 	 ed 	 	.
in	 other 	 s 	 	,	kosher	and	 hal 	 al 	 	meat	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 bann 	 ed 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	speak	.
and	on	the	flip	side	,	we	have	 trans 	 national 	 	islamist	 extrem 	 ists 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	the	same	thing	 a 	 cross 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 socie 	 ties 	 	.
and	so	they	are	 pocket 	 s 	 	of	 parochial 	 ism 	 	that	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	in	a	way	that	 make 	 s 	 	them	feel	like	they	are	 main 	 stream 	 	.
now	that	never	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	possible	before	.
they	would	have	felt	 isolate 	 d 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	these	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 techno 	 logies 	 	came	around	and	 connect 	 ed 	 	them	in	a	way	that	made	them	feel	part	of	a	 large 	 r 	 	 phenomen 	 on 	 	.
where	 do 	 es 	 	that	 leav 	 e 	 	 demo 	 cracy 	 	 aspir 	 ants 	 	?
well	i	 believ 	 e 	 	they	're	 get 	 ting 	 	left	far	 be 	 hind 	 	.
and	i	'll	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	here	at	 th 	 is 	 	stage	.
if	any	of	you	 remember 	 s 	 	the	christmas	day	bomb	plot	:	there	's	a	man	 call 	 ed 	 	anwar	al-awlaki	.
 a 	 s 	 	an	american	citizen	,	 ethnic 	 ally 	 	a	yemeni	,	in	 hid 	 ing 	 	 current 	 ly 	 	in	yemen	,	who	inspired	a	nigerian	,	son	of	the	head	of	nigeria	's	national	bank	.
 th 	 is 	 	nigerian	student	 stud 	 ied 	 	in	london	,	trained	in	yemen	,	 board 	 ed 	 	a	flight	in	amsterdam	to	attack	america	.
in	the	 mean 	 while 	 	,	the	old	 ment 	 ality 	 	with	a	capital	o	,	was	 represent 	 ed 	 	by	his	father	,	the	head	of	the	nigerian	bank	,	 war 	 ning 	 	the	cia	that	his	own	son	was	about	to	attack	,
and	 th 	 is 	 	 war 	 ning 	 	fell	on	deaf	 ear 	 s 	 	.
the	old	 ment 	 ality 	 	with	a	capital	o	,	 a 	 s 	 	 represent 	 ed 	 	by	the	nation	-	state	,	not	yet	fully	 in 	 to 	 	the	age	of	behavior	,	not	 recogn 	 izing 	 	the	power	of	 trans 	 national 	 	social	 move 	 ments 	 	,	got	left	 be 	 hind 	 	.
and	the	christmas	day	 bomb 	 er 	 	 al 	 most 	 	 succeed 	 ed 	 	in	 attack 	 ing 	 	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	of	america	.
 aga 	 in 	 	with	the	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	the	far	right	:	that	we	find	,	 iron 	 ically 	 	,	 xeno 	 phobic 	 	 national 	 ists 	 	are	 util 	 izing 	 	the	 benefit 	 s 	 	of	 global 	 ization 	 	.
so	why	are	they	 succeed 	 ing 	 	?
and	why	are	 demo 	 cracy 	 	 aspir 	 ants 	 	 fall 	 ing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	?
well	we	need	to	understand	the	power	of	the	social	 move 	 ments 	 	who	understand	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	a	social	 move 	 ment 	 	is	 com 	 prise 	 d 	 	,	in	my	view	,	it	's	 com 	 prise 	 d 	 	of	four	main	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 com 	 prise 	 d 	 	of	 idea 	 s 	 	and	 narrative 	 s 	 	and	 symbol 	 s 	 	and	 lead 	 ers 	 	.
i	'll	talk	you	through	one	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	and	that	's	the	 ex 	 ample 	 	that	 every 	 one 	 	here	will	be	aware	of	,	and	that	's	the	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	al	-	qaeda	.
if	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	you	to	think	of	the	 idea 	 s 	 	of	al-qaeda	,	that	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 come 	 s 	 	to	your	mind	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	.
if	i	ask	you	to	think	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 narrative 	 s 	 	--	the	west	 be 	 ing 	 	at	war	with	islam	,	the	need	to	defend	islam	against	the	west	--	these	 narrative 	 s 	 	,	they	come	to	your	mind	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	.
 incident 	 ally 	 	,	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	 idea 	 s 	 	and	 narrative 	 s 	 	:	the	idea	is	the	cause	that	one	 believ 	 es 	 	in	;	and	the	narrative	is	the	way	to	sell	that	cause	--	the	 propag 	 and 	 a 	 	,	if	you	like	,	of	the	cause	.
so	the	 idea 	 s 	 	and	the	 narrative 	 s 	 	of	al-qaeda	come	to	your	mind	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	.
if	i	ask	you	to	think	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 symbol 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	,	they	come	to	your	mind	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	.
one	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	was	 kill 	 ed 	 	in	pakistan	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	.
so	these	 symbol 	 s 	 	and	these	 lead 	 ers 	 	come	to	your	mind	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	.
and	that	's	the	power	of	social	 move 	 ments 	 	.
they	're	 trans 	 national 	 	,	and	they	bond	around	these	 idea 	 s 	 	and	 narrative 	 s 	 	and	these	 symbol 	 s 	 	and	these	 lead 	 ers 	 	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	if	i	ask	your	 mind 	 s 	 	to	focus	 current 	 ly 	 	on	pakistan	,	and	i	ask	you	to	think	of	the	 symbol 	 s 	 	and	the	 lead 	 ers 	 	for	 demo 	 cracy 	 	in	pakistan	 to 	 day 	 	,	you	'll	be	hard	 press 	 ed 	 	to	think	beyond	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	the	 assassin 	 ation 	 	of	benazir	bhutto	.
which	 mean 	 s 	 	,	by	definition	,	that	 part 	 icular 	 	 lead 	 er 	 	no	 long 	 er 	 	 exist 	 s 	 	.
one	of	the	 problem 	 s 	 	we	're	facing	is	,	in	my	view	,	that	there	are	no	 global 	 ized 	 	,	youth	-	led	,	 grass 	 root 	 s 	 	social	 move 	 ments 	 	 advoc 	 ating 	 	for	 democrat 	 ic 	 	culture	 a 	 cross 	 	muslim	-	 major 	 ity 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	.
there	is	no	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	the	al-qaeda	,	 with 	 out 	 	the	 terror 	 ism 	 	,	for	 demo 	 cracy 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	muslim	-	 major 	 ity 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	.
there	are	no	 idea 	 s 	 	and	 narrative 	 s 	 	and	 lead 	 ers 	 	and	 symbol 	 s 	 	 advoc 	 ating 	 	the	 democrat 	 ic 	 	culture	on	the	ground	.
so	that	 beg 	 s 	 	the	next	question	.
why	is	it	that	 extrem 	 ist 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	of	the	far	-	right	or	of	the	islamist	 extrem 	 ism 	 	--	islamism	meaning	 t 	 hose 	 	who	wish	to	impose	one	version	of	islam	over	the	rest	of	 socie 	 ty 	 	--	why	is	it	that	they	are	 succeed 	 ing 	 	in	 organ 	 izing 	 	in	a	 global 	 ized 	 	way	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	who	 aspir 	 e 	 	to	 democrat 	 ic 	 	culture	are	 fall 	 ing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	?
and	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	's	for	four	 reason 	 s 	 	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	number	one	,	it	's	 com 	 place 	 ncy 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	who	 aspir 	 e 	 	to	 democrat 	 ic 	 	culture	are	in	power	,	or	have	 socie 	 ties 	 	that	are	 lead 	 ing 	 	 global 	 ized 	 	,	 power 	 ful 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	,	 power 	 ful 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	.
and	that	level	of	 com 	 place 	 ncy 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	they	do	n't	feel	the	need	to	 advoc 	 ate 	 	for	that	culture	.
the	second	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	is	 politic 	 al 	 	 correct 	 ness 	 	.
that	we	have	a	 hesit 	 ation 	 	in	 es 	 po 	 using 	 	the	 universal 	 ity 	 	of	 democrat 	 ic 	 	culture	 be 	 cause 	 	we	are	 associ 	 ating 	 	that	--	we	associate	 believ 	 ing 	 	in	the	 universal 	 ity 	 	of	our	 value 	 s 	 	--	with	 extrem 	 ists 	 	.
yet	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 when 	 ever 	 	we	talk	about	human	 right 	 s 	 	,	we	do	say	that	human	 right 	 s 	 	are	universal	.
but	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	out	to	 propag 	 ate 	 	that	view	is	 associate 	 d 	 	with	either	 neo 	 conserv 	 at 	 ivism 	 	or	with	islamist	 extrem 	 ism 	 	.
to	go	around	 say 	 ing 	 	that	i	 believ 	 e 	 	 democrat 	 ic 	 	culture	is	the	best	that	we	've	 arriv 	 ed 	 	at	 a 	 s 	 	a	form	of	 politic 	 al 	 	 organ 	 izing 	 	is	 associate 	 d 	 	with	 extrem 	 ism 	 	.
and	the	third	,	 democrat 	 ic 	 	choice	in	muslim	-	 major 	 ity 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 relegate 	 d 	 	to	a	 politic 	 al 	 	choice	,	meaning	 politic 	 al 	 	 part 	 ies 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	of	these	 socie 	 ties 	 	ask	people	to	vote	for	them	 a 	 s 	 	the	 democrat 	 ic 	 	party	,	but	then	the	other	 part 	 ies 	 	ask	them	to	vote	for	them	 a 	 s 	 	the	 militar 	 y 	 	party	--	 want 	 ing 	 	to	rule	by	 militar 	 y 	 	 dictator 	 ship 	 	.
and	then	you	have	a	third	party	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	vote	for	us	;	we	'll	establish	a	 theo 	 cracy 	 	.	``	so	 demo 	 cracy 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 mere 	 ly 	 	one	 politic 	 al 	 	choice	among	 man 	 y 	 	other	 form 	 s 	 	of	 politic 	 al 	 	 choice 	 s 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	.
and	what	 happen 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	when	 t 	 hose 	 	 part 	 ies 	 	are	 elect 	 ed 	 	,	and	 inevit 	 ably 	 	they	fail	,	or	 inevit 	 ably 	 	they	make	 politic 	 al 	 	 mistak 	 es 	 	,	 demo 	 cracy 	 	 take 	 s 	 	the	blame	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 politic 	 al 	 	 mistak 	 es 	 	.
and	then	people	say	,	``	we	've	 tri 	 ed 	 	 demo 	 cracy 	 	.	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	work	.
let	's	 br 	 ing 	 	the	 militar 	 y 	 	back	 aga 	 in 	 	.	``	and	the	fourth	reason	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	is	what	i	've	 label 	 ed 	 	here	on	the	slide	 a 	 s 	 	the	 ideo 	 logy 	 	of	 resist 	 ance 	 	.
what	i	mean	by	that	is	,	if	the	world	 super 	 power 	 	 to 	 day 	 	was	a	 commun 	 ist 	 	,	it	would	be	much	 eas 	 ier 	 	for	 demo 	 cracy 	 	 activist 	 s 	 	to	use	 demo 	 cracy 	 	 activ 	 ism 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	form	of	 resist 	 ance 	 	against	 colonial 	 ism 	 	,	than	it	is	 to 	 day 	 	with	the	world	 super 	 power 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	america	,	 occupy 	 ing 	 	certain	 land 	 s 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	 es 	 po 	 using 	 	 democrat 	 ic 	 	 ideal 	 s 	 	.
so	 rough 	 ly 	 	these	four	 reason 	 s 	 	make	it	a	lot	more	difficult	for	 democrat 	 ic 	 	culture	to	spread	 a 	 s 	 	a	 civil 	 ization 	 al 	 	choice	,	not	 mere 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 politic 	 al 	 	choice	.
when	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 t 	 hose 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	,	let	's	break	down	certain	 pre 	 conception 	 s 	 	.
is	it	just	about	 griev 	 ance 	 s 	 	?
is	it	just	about	a	lack	of	education	?
well	 statistic 	 ally 	 	,	the	 major 	 ity 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	who	join	 extrem 	 ist 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	are	 high 	 ly 	 	educated	.
 statistic 	 ally 	 	,	they	are	educated	,	on	average	,	above	the	education	 level 	 s 	 	of	western	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
 anecdotal 	 ly 	 	,	we	can	 demonst 	 rate 	 	that	if	poverty	was	the	 on 	 ly 	 	factor	,	well	bin	laden	is	from	one	of	the	 rich 	 est 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	in	saudi	arabia	.
his	 de 	 put 	 y 	 	,	ayman	al-zawahiri	,	was	a	 pediatric 	 ian 	 	--	not	an	ill	-	educated	man	.
 inter 	 national 	 	aid	and	 develop 	 ment 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	going	on	for	 year 	 s 	 	,	but	 extrem 	 ism 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	,	in	 man 	 y 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	on	the	rise	.
and	what	i	 believ 	 e 	 	is	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	is	genuine	 grass 	 root 	 s 	 	 activ 	 ism 	 	on	the	ground	,	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	 inter 	 national 	 	aid	,	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	education	,	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	health	.
not	exclusive	to	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	but	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	them	,	is	 propag 	 ating 	 	a	genuine	demand	for	 demo 	 cracy 	 	on	the	ground	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	i	 believ 	 e 	 	 neo 	 conserv 	 at 	 ism 	 	had	it	 up 	 side 	 	-	down	.
 neo 	 conserv 	 at 	 ism 	 	had	the	 philosoph 	 y 	 	that	you	go	in	with	a	supply	-	led	approach	to	impose	 democrat 	 ic 	 	 value 	 s 	 	from	the	top	down	.
 where 	 a 	 s 	 	islamists	and	far	-	right	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	,	for	 decade 	 s 	 	,	have	 be 	 en 	 	building	demand	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 ideo 	 logy 	 	on	the	 grass 	 root 	 s 	 	.
they	've	 be 	 en 	 	building	 civil 	 ization 	 al 	 	demand	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 value 	 s 	 	on	the	 grass 	 root 	 s 	 	,	and	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	 transit 	 ion 	 	to	 socie 	 ties 	 	that	are	 increasing 	 ly 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	for	a	form	of	islamism	.
mass	 move 	 ments 	 	in	pakistan	have	 be 	 en 	 	 represent 	 ed 	 	after	the	arab	 up 	 ris 	 ing 	 s 	 	 main 	 ly 	 	by	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	 claim 	 ing 	 	for	some	form	of	 theo 	 cracy 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	for	a	 democrat 	 ic 	 	 up 	 ris 	 ing 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	since	pre	-	 part 	 ition 	 	,	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	building	demand	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 ideo 	 logy 	 	on	the	ground	.
and	what	's	 need 	 ed 	 	is	a	genuine	 trans 	 national 	 	youth	-	led	 move 	 ment 	 	that	 work 	 s 	 	to	 active 	 ly 	 	 advoc 	 ate 	 	for	the	 democrat 	 ic 	 	culture	--	which	is	 necess 	 arily 	 	more	than	just	 election 	 s 	 	.
but	 with 	 out 	 	 free 	 dom 	 	of	speech	,	you	ca	n't	have	free	and	fair	 election 	 s 	 	.
 with 	 out 	 	human	 right 	 s 	 	,	you	do	n't	have	the	 protect 	 ion 	 	 grant 	 ed 	 	to	you	to	campaign	.
 with 	 out 	 	 free 	 dom 	 	of	belief	,	you	do	n't	have	the	right	to	join	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	.
so	what	's	 need 	 ed 	 	is	 t 	 hose 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	on	the	ground	 advoc 	 ating 	 	for	the	 democrat 	 ic 	 	culture	 it 	 self 	 	to	create	the	demand	on	the	ground	for	 th 	 is 	 	culture	.
what	that	will	do	is	avoid	the	problem	i	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 ear 	 lier 	 	,	where	 current 	 ly 	 	we	have	 politic 	 al 	 	 part 	 ies 	 	 present 	 ing 	 	 demo 	 cracy 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 mere 	 ly 	 	a	 politic 	 al 	 	choice	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	 a 	 long 	 side 	 	other	 choice 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 militar 	 y 	 	rule	and	 theo 	 cracy 	 	.
 where 	 a 	 s 	 	if	we	start	building	 th 	 is 	 	demand	on	the	ground	on	a	 civil 	 ization 	 al 	 	level	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 mere 	 ly 	 	on	a	 politic 	 al 	 	level	,	a	level	above	 politic 	 s 	 	--	 move 	 ments 	 	that	are	not	 politic 	 al 	 	 part 	 ies 	 	,	but	are	 ra 	 ther 	 	creating	 th 	 is 	 	 civil 	 ization 	 al 	 	demand	for	 th 	 is 	 	 democrat 	 ic 	 	culture	.	what	we	'll	have	in	the	end	is	 th 	 is 	 	ideal	that	you	see	on	the	slide	here	--	the	ideal	that	people	should	vote	in	an	 exist 	 ing 	 	 demo 	 cracy 	 	,	not	for	a	 demo 	 cracy 	 	.
but	to	get	to	that	stage	,	where	 demo 	 cracy 	 	 build 	 s 	 	the	fabric	of	 socie 	 ty 	 	and	the	 politic 	 al 	 	 choice 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	that	fabric	,	but	are	 certain 	 ly 	 	not	 theo 	 cratic 	 	and	 militar 	 y 	 	 dictator 	 ship 	 	--	i.e	.	you	're	 vot 	 ing 	 	in	a	 demo 	 cracy 	 	,	in	an	 exist 	 ing 	 	 demo 	 cracy 	 	,	and	that	 demo 	 cracy 	 	is	not	 mere 	 ly 	 	one	of	the	 choice 	 s 	 	at	the	 ball 	 ot 	 	box	.
to	get	to	that	stage	,	we	 genuine 	 ly 	 	need	to	start	building	demand	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	on	the	ground	.
now	to	conclude	,	how	 do 	 es 	 	that	happen	?
well	,	egypt	is	a	good	 start 	 ing 	 	point	.
the	arab	 up 	 ris 	 ing 	 s 	 	have	 demonst 	 rated 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	 al 	 ready 	 	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
but	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	arab	 up 	 ris 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	egypt	was	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 cath 	 art 	 ic 	 	for	me	.
what	 happen 	 ed 	 	there	was	a	 politic 	 al 	 	 coal 	 ition 	 	 gather 	 ed 	 	together	for	a	 politic 	 al 	 	goal	,	and	that	was	to	 re 	 move 	 	the	 lead 	 er 	 	.
we	need	to	move	one	step	beyond	that	now	.
we	need	to	see	how	we	can	help	 t 	 hose 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	move	from	 politic 	 al 	 	 coal 	 ition 	 s 	 	,	 loose 	 ly 	 	based	 politic 	 al 	 	 coal 	 ition 	 s 	 	,	to	 civil 	 ization 	 al 	 	 coal 	 ition 	 s 	 	that	are	 work 	 ing 	 	for	the	 ideal 	 s 	 	and	 narrative 	 s 	 	of	the	 democrat 	 ic 	 	culture	on	the	ground	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	not	 en 	 ough 	 	to	 re 	 move 	 	a	 lead 	 er 	 	or	 rul 	 er 	 	or	dictator	.
that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	guarantee	that	what	 come 	 s 	 	next	will	be	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	built	on	 democrat 	 ic 	 	 value 	 s 	 	.
but	 general 	 ly 	 	,	the	 trend 	 s 	 	that	start	in	egypt	have	 historic 	 ally 	 	spread	 a 	 cross 	 	the	mena	region	,	the	middle	east	and	north	africa	region	.
so	when	arab	 social 	 ism 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	in	egypt	,	it	spread	 a 	 cross 	 	the	region	.
in	the	'80s	and	'90s	when	islamism	 start 	 ed 	 	in	the	region	,	it	spread	 a 	 cross 	 	the	mena	region	 a 	 s 	 	a	whole	.
and	the	 aspir 	 ation 	 	that	we	have	at	the	moment	--	 a 	 s 	 	young	arabs	are	 prov 	 ing 	 	 to 	 day 	 	and	 instant 	 ly 	 	 re 	 brand 	 ing 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	prepared	to	die	for	more	than	just	 terror 	 ism 	 	--	is	that	there	is	a	chance	that	 democrat 	 ic 	 	culture	can	start	in	the	region	and	spread	 a 	 cross 	 	to	the	rest	of	the	 count 	 ries 	 	that	are	 surround 	 ing 	 	that	.
but	that	will	 requir 	 e 	 	 help 	 ing 	 	these	 socie 	 ties 	 	 transit 	 ion 	 	from	 hav 	 ing 	 	 mere 	 ly 	 	 politic 	 al 	 	 coal 	 ition 	 s 	 	to	building	 genuine 	 ly 	 	 grass 	 root 	 s 	 	-	based	social	 move 	 ments 	 	that	 advoc 	 ate 	 	for	the	 democrat 	 ic 	 	culture	.
and	we	've	made	a	start	for	that	in	pakistan	with	a	 move 	 ment 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	khudi	,	where	we	are	 work 	 ing 	 	on	the	ground	to	 encourag 	 e 	 	the	youth	to	create	genuine	buy	-	in	for	the	 democrat 	 ic 	 	culture	.
and	it	's	with	that	thought	that	i	'll	end	.
and	my	time	is	up	,	and	thank	you	for	your	time	.
