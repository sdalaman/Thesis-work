 th 	 is 	 	is	a	stream	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	river	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	all	over	the	country	.
there	are	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 mile 	 s 	 	of	 de 	 water 	 ed 	 	 stream 	 s 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
on	 th 	 is 	 	map	,	the	 color 	 ed 	 	 area 	 s 	 	represent	water	 conflict 	 s 	 	.
similar	 problem 	 s 	 	are	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	in	the	east	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
the	 reason 	 s 	 	vary	state	to	state	,	but	 most 	 ly 	 	in	the	 detail 	 s 	 	.
there	are	4,000	 mile 	 s 	 	of	 de 	 water 	 ed 	 	 stream 	 s 	 	in	montana	 al 	 one 	 	.
they	would	 ordinari 	 ly 	 	support	fish	and	other	 wild 	 life 	 	.
they	're	the	 vein 	 s 	 	of	the	 eco 	 system 	 	,	and	they	're	often	empty	 vein 	 s 	 	.
i	want	to	tell	you	the	story	of	just	one	of	these	 stream 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	an	 arche 	 type 	 	for	the	 large 	 r 	 	story	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 prick 	 ly 	 	pear	creek	.
it	 run 	 s 	 	through	a	 populate 	 d 	 	area	from	east	helena	to	lake	helena	.
it	 support 	 s 	 	wild	fish	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 cut 	 throat 	 	,	 brow 	 n 	 	and	 rain 	 bow 	 	 trou 	 t 	 	.
 near 	 ly 	 	every	year	for	more	than	a	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 look 	 ed 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	summer	.
how	did	we	get	here	?
well	,	it	 start 	 ed 	 	back	in	the	late	1800s	when	people	 start 	 ed 	 	 settl 	 ing 	 	in	 place 	 s 	 	like	montana	.
in	short	,	there	was	a	lot	of	water	and	there	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 ver 	 y 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	more	people	 show 	 ed 	 	up	 want 	 ing 	 	water	,	the	 folk 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	there	first	got	a	little	 concern 	 ed 	 	,	and	in	1865	,	montana	 pass 	 ed 	 	 it 	 s 	 	first	water	law	.
it	 bas 	 ically 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 every 	 body 	 	near	the	stream	can	share	in	the	stream	.
 odd 	 ly 	 	,	a	lot	of	people	 show 	 ed 	 	up	 want 	 ing 	 	to	share	the	stream	,	and	the	 folk 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	there	first	got	 concern 	 ed 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	out	 the 	 ir 	 	 lawyer 	 s 	 	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	 precede 	 nt 	 	-	setting	 suit 	 s 	 	in	1870	and	1872	,	both	 in 	 vol 	 v 	 ing 	 	 prick 	 ly 	 	pear	creek	.
and	in	1921	,	the	montana	 suprem 	 e 	 	court	 rul 	 ed 	 	in	a	case	 in 	 vol 	 v 	 ing 	 	 prick 	 ly 	 	pear	that	the	 folk 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	there	first	had	the	first	,	or	``	senior	water	 right 	 s 	 	.	``
these	senior	water	 right 	 s 	 	are	key	.
the	problem	is	that	all	over	the	west	now	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
some	of	these	creeks	have	 claim 	 s 	 	for	50	to	100	 time 	 s 	 	more	water	than	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	in	the	stream	.
and	the	senior	water	 right 	 s 	 	 holder 	 s 	 	,	if	they	do	n't	use	 the 	 ir 	 	water	right	,	they	risk	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	water	right	,	 a 	 long 	 	with	the	economic	value	that	 go 	 es 	 	with	it	.
so	they	have	no	incentive	to	 conserv 	 e 	 	.
so	it	's	not	just	about	the	number	of	people	;	the	system	 it 	 self 	 	 create 	 s 	 	a	 dis 	 incentive 	 	to	 conserv 	 e 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	you	can	lose	your	water	right	if	you	do	n't	use	it	.
so	after	 decade 	 s 	 	of	 law 	 suit 	 s 	 	and	140	 year 	 s 	 	,	now	,	of	experience	,	we	still	have	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	's	a	broken	system	.	there	's	a	 dis 	 incentive 	 	to	 conserv 	 e 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	if	you	do	n't	use	your	water	right	,	you	can	lose	your	water	right	.
and	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	you	all	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 create 	 d 	 	significant	 conflict 	 s 	 	between	the	 agricultur 	 al 	 	and	 environment 	 al 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	now	i	'm	going	to	change	 gear 	 s 	 	here	.
most	of	you	will	be	happy	to	know	that	the	rest	of	the	 present 	 ation 	 	's	free	,
and	some	of	you	'll	be	happy	to	know	that	it	 involve 	 s 	 	beer	.
there	's	 an 	 other 	 	thing	 happen 	 ing 	 	around	the	country	,	which	is	that	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	get	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	 the 	 ir 	 	water	 foot 	 print 	 	.
they	're	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	 secu 	 ring 	 	an	 ad 	 equate 	 	supply	of	water	,	they	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	be	 re 	 ally 	 	efficient	with	 the 	 ir 	 	water	use	,	and	they	're	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	how	 the 	 ir 	 	water	use	 affect 	 s 	 	the	image	of	 the 	 ir 	 	brand	.
well	,	it	's	a	national	problem	,	but	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	 an 	 other 	 	story	from	montana	,	and	it	 involve 	 s 	 	beer	.
i	bet	you	did	n't	know	,	it	 take 	 s 	 	about	5	 pint 	 s 	 	of	water	to	make	a	pint	of	beer	.
if	you	include	all	the	drain	,	it	 take 	 s 	 	more	than	a	hundred	 pint 	 s 	 	of	water	to	make	a	pint	of	beer	.
now	the	 brew 	 ers 	 	in	montana	have	 al 	 ready 	 	 d 	 one 	 	a	lot	to	 reduc 	 e 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	water	consumption	,
but	they	still	use	 million 	 s 	 	of	 gallon 	 s 	 	of	water	.
i	mean	,	there	's	water	in	beer	.
so	what	can	they	do	about	 th 	 is 	 	 remain 	 ing 	 	water	 foot 	 print 	 	that	can	have	serious	 effect 	 s 	 	on	the	 eco 	 system 	 	?
these	 eco 	 system 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	the	montana	 brew 	 ers 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 custom 	 ers 	 	.
after	all	,	there	's	a	strong	correlation	between	water	and	 fish 	 ing 	 	,
and	for	some	,	there	's	a	strong	correlation	between	 fish 	 ing 	 	and	beer	.
so	the	montana	 brew 	 ers 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 custom 	 ers 	 	are	 concern 	 ed 	 	,	and	they	're	looking	for	some	way	to	address	the	problem	.
so	how	can	they	address	 th 	 is 	 	 remain 	 ing 	 	water	 foot 	 print 	 	?
remember	 prick 	 ly 	 	pear	.
up	 un 	 til 	 	now	,	business	water	 steward 	 ship 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 limit 	 ed 	 	to	 measur 	 ing 	 	and	 reduc 	 ing 	 	,	and	we	're	 suggest 	 ing 	 	that	the	next	step	is	to	 re 	 store 	 	.
remember	 prick 	 ly 	 	pear	.
it	's	a	broken	system	.
you	've	got	a	 dis 	 incentive 	 	to	 conserv 	 e 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	do	n't	use	your	water	right	,	you	risk	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	your	water	right	.
well	,	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	connect	these	two	 world 	 s 	 	--	the	world	of	the	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	water	 foot 	 print 	 s 	 	and	the	world	of	the	 farm 	 ers 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	senior	water	 right 	 s 	 	on	these	creeks	.
in	some	 state 	 s 	 	,	senior	water	 right 	 s 	 	 holder 	 s 	 	can	 leav 	 e 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	water	in	-	stream	while	 legal 	 ly 	 	 protect 	 ing 	 	it	from	 other 	 s 	 	and	 maintain 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	water	right	.
after	all	,	it	is	 the 	 ir 	 	water	right	,	and	if	they	want	to	use	that	water	right	to	help	the	fish	grow	in	the	stream	,	it	's	 the 	 ir 	 	right	to	do	so	.
but	they	have	no	incentive	to	do	so	.
so	,	 work 	 ing 	 	with	local	water	 trust 	 s 	 	,	we	 create 	 d 	 	an	incentive	to	do	so	.
we	pay	them	to	 leav 	 e 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	water	in	-	stream	.
that	's	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	here	.
 th 	 is 	 	individual	 ha 	 s 	 	made	the	choice	and	is	 clo 	 s 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	water	 divers 	 ion 	 	,	 leav 	 ing 	 	the	water	in	the	stream	.
he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	lose	the	water	right	,	he	just	 choos 	 es 	 	to	 app 	 ly 	 	that	right	,	or	some	 port 	 ion 	 	of	it	,	to	the	stream	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	to	the	land	.
 be 	 cause 	 	he	's	the	senior	water	 right 	 s 	 	holder	,	he	can	protect	the	water	from	other	 user 	 s 	 	in	the	stream	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
he	 get 	 s 	 	paid	to	 leav 	 e 	 	the	water	in	the	stream	.
 th 	 is 	 	guy	's	 measur 	 ing 	 	the	water	that	 th 	 is 	 	 leav 	 es 	 	in	the	stream	.
we	then	take	the	 measur 	 ed 	 	water	,	we	divide	it	 in 	 to 	 	thousand	-	gallon	 increment 	 s 	 	.
each	increment	 get 	 s 	 	a	 s 	 erial 	 	number	and	a	certificate	,	and	then	the	 brew 	 ers 	 	and	 other 	 s 	 	buy	 t 	 hose 	 	 certificate 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	way	to	return	water	to	these	 de 	 grad 	 ed 	 	 eco 	 system 	 s 	 	.
the	 brew 	 ers 	 	pay	to	 re 	 store 	 	water	to	the	stream	.
it	 provide 	 s 	 	a	simple	,	 in 	 expensive 	 	and	 measur 	 able 	 	way	to	return	water	to	these	 de 	 grad 	 ed 	 	 eco 	 system 	 s 	 	,	while	giving	 farm 	 ers 	 	an	economic	choice	and	giving	 business 	 es 	 	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	 the 	 ir 	 	water	 foot 	 print 	 s 	 	an	easy	way	to	deal	with	them	.
after	140	 year 	 s 	 	of	conflict	and	100	 year 	 s 	 	of	dry	 stream 	 s 	 	,	a	 circum 	 stance 	 	that	 litig 	 ation 	 	and	 regulat 	 ion 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 solve 	 d 	 	,	we	put	together	a	market	-	based	,	 will 	 ing 	 	 buy 	 er 	 	,	 will 	 ing 	 	seller	solution	--	a	solution	that	 do 	 es 	 	not	 requir 	 e 	 	 litig 	 ation 	 	.
it	's	about	giving	 folk 	 s 	 	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	 the 	 ir 	 	water	 foot 	 print 	 s 	 	a	real	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	put	water	where	it	's	 critical 	 ly 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	,	 in 	 to 	 	these	 de 	 grad 	 ed 	 	 eco 	 system 	 s 	 	,	while	at	the	same	time	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	 farm 	 ers 	 	a	 meaning 	 ful 	 	economic	choice	about	how	 the 	 ir 	 	water	is	used	.
these	 trans 	 action 	 s 	 	create	 al 	 lies 	 	,	not	 ene 	 mies 	 	.
they	connect	people	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 divid 	 ing 	 	them	.
and	they	provide	 need 	 ed 	 	economic	support	for	 r 	 ural 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	.
and	most	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	 work 	 ing 	 	.
we	've	 return 	 ed 	 	more	than	four	billion	 gallon 	 s 	 	of	water	to	 de 	 grad 	 ed 	 	 eco 	 system 	 s 	 	.
we	've	 connect 	 ed 	 	senior	water	 right 	 s 	 	 holder 	 s 	 	with	 brew 	 ers 	 	in	montana	,	with	 hotel 	 s 	 	and	tea	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	in	oregon	and	with	high	-	tech	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	that	use	a	lot	of	water	in	the	 south 	 west 	 	.
and	when	we	make	these	 connect 	 ions 	 	,	we	can	and	we	do	turn	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
