it	was	an	 in 	 credible 	 	surprise	to	me	to	find	out	that	there	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	an	 organ 	 ization 	 	that	 car 	 ed 	 	about	both	 part 	 s 	 	of	my	life	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	i	work	 a 	 s 	 	a	 theoretic 	 al 	 	physicist	.
i	develop	and	test	 model 	 s 	 	of	the	big	bang	,	using	 observ 	 ation 	 al 	 	data	.
and	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 moon 	 light 	 ing 	 	for	the	last	five	 year 	 s 	 	 help 	 ing 	 	with	a	project	in	africa	.
and	,	i	get	a	lot	of	 fl 	 ak 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	at	cambridge	.
people	wonder	,	you	know	,	``	how	do	you	have	time	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	?	``	and	so	on	.
and	so	it	was	 simpl 	 y 	 	 astonish 	 ing 	 	to	me	to	find	an	 organ 	 ization 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 appreciate 	 d 	 	both	 t 	 hose 	 	 side 	 s 	 	.
so	i	thought	i	'd	start	off	by	just	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	a	little	bit	about	 my 	 self 	 	and	why	i	lead	 th 	 is 	 	schizophrenic	life	.
well	,	i	was	born	in	south	africa	and	my	 parent 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 imprison 	 ed 	 	for	 resist 	 ing 	 	the	racist	regime	.
when	they	 we 	 re 	 	released	,	we	left	and	we	went	 a 	 s 	 	 refuge 	 es 	 	to	kenya	and	tanzania	.
both	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	young	 count 	 ries 	 	then	,	and	full	of	hope	for	the	future	.
we	had	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 child 	 hood 	 	.	we	did	n't	have	any	money	,	but	we	 we 	 re 	 	 out 	 door 	 s 	 	most	of	the	time	.
we	had	fantastic	 friend 	 s 	 	and	we	saw	the	 wonder 	 s 	 	of	the	world	,	like	kilimanjaro	,	serengeti	and	the	olduvai	gorge	.
well	,	then	we	 move 	 d 	 	to	london	for	high	school	.
and	after	that	--	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	much	to	say	about	that	.
it	was	 ra 	 ther 	 	dull	.	but	i	came	back	to	africa	at	the	age	of	17	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	volunteer	teacher	to	lesotho	,	which	is	a	 tin 	 y 	 	country	,	 surround 	 ed 	 	at	that	time	by	apartheid	south	africa	.
well	,	80	percent	of	the	men	in	lesotho	 work 	 ed 	 	in	the	 mine 	 s 	 	over	the	border	,	in	brutal	 condition 	 s 	 	.
 never 	 the 	 less 	 	,	i	--	 a 	 s 	 	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	a	 ra 	 ther 	 	 irrit 	 ating 	 	young	,	white	man	coming	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	village	,	i	was	 welcome 	 d 	 	with	 in 	 credible 	 	 hospital 	 ity 	 	and	 warm 	 th 	 	.
but	the	 kid 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	the	best	part	.
the	 kid 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	:	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	eager	and	often	 ver 	 y 	 	bright	.
and	i	'm	just	going	to	tell	you	one	story	,	which	got	through	to	me	.
i	used	to	try	to	take	the	 kid 	 s 	 	 out 	 side 	 	 a 	 s 	 	often	 a 	 s 	 	possible	,	to	try	to	connect	the	academic	stuff	with	the	real	world	.
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	used	to	that	.
but	i	took	them	 out 	 side 	 	one	day	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	want	you	to	estimate	the	height	of	the	building	.	``
and	i	 expect 	 ed 	 	them	to	put	a	 rul 	 er 	 	next	to	the	wall	,	 s 	 ize 	 	it	up	with	a	finger	,	and	make	an	estimate	of	the	height	.
but	there	was	one	little	boy	,	 ver 	 y 	 	small	for	his	age	.
he	was	the	son	of	one	of	the	 poor 	 est 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	in	the	village	.
and	he	was	n't	 do 	 ing 	 	that	.	he	was	 s 	 crib 	 bling 	 	with	chalk	on	the	 pave 	 ment 	 	.
and	so	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	--	i	was	 annoy 	 ed 	 	--	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	are	you	 do 	 ing 	 	?
i	want	you	to	estimate	the	height	of	the	building	.	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	ok	.	i	 measur 	 ed 	 	the	height	of	a	brick	.
i	 count 	 ed 	 	the	number	of	 brick 	 s 	 	and	now	i	'm	 multi 	 ply 	 ing 	 	.	``
well	--	--	i	had	n't	thought	of	that	one	.
and	 man 	 y 	 	 experience 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	me	.
 an 	 other 	 	one	is	that	i	met	a	 min 	 er 	 	.	he	was	home	on	his	three	-	month	 leav 	 e 	 	from	the	 mine 	 s 	 	.
 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	next	to	him	one	day	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	one	thing	that	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 love 	 d 	 	at	school	.
and	you	know	what	it	was	?	shakespeare	.	``	and	he	 re 	 cit 	 ed 	 	some	to	me	.
and	these	and	 man 	 y 	 	similar	 experience 	 s 	 	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	me	that	there	are	just	 ton 	 s 	 	of	bright	 kid 	 s 	 	in	africa	--	 invent 	 ive 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	,	intellectual	 kid 	 s 	 	--	and	 starv 	 ed 	 	of	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
and	if	africa	is	going	to	get	 fix 	 ed 	 	,	it	's	by	them	,	not	by	us	.
well	,	after	--	--	that	's	the	truth	.
well	,	after	lesotho	,	i	 travel 	 ed 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	africa	before	 return 	 ing 	 	to	england	--	so	gray	and	 depress 	 ing 	 	,	in	 compar 	 ison 	 	.
and	i	went	to	cambridge	.	and	there	,	i	fell	for	 theoretic 	 al 	 	physics	.
well	,	i	'm	not	going	to	explain	 th 	 is 	 	 equ 	 ation 	 	,	but	 theoretic 	 al 	 	physics	is	 re 	 ally 	 	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	subject	.
we	can	write	down	all	the	 law 	 s 	 	of	physics	we	know	in	one	line	.
and	,	 admitted 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 short 	 hand 	 	 not 	 ation 	 	.
and	it	 contain 	 s 	 	18	free	 parameter 	 s 	 	,	ok	,	which	we	have	to	fit	to	the	data	.
so	it	's	not	the	final	story	,	but	it	's	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	 summ 	 ary 	 	of	 every 	 thing 	 	we	know	about	nature	at	the	most	 bas 	 ic 	 	level	.
and	 a 	 part 	 	from	a	few	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	loose	 end 	 s 	 	,	which	you	've	heard	about	here	--	like	dark	energy	and	dark	matter	--	 th 	 is 	 	 equ 	 ation 	 	 de 	 scribe 	 s 	 	,	 seem 	 s 	 	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	about	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	and	what	's	in	it	.
but	there	's	one	big	 puzzl 	 e 	 	 remain 	 ing 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	was	most	 succinct 	 ly 	 	put	to	me	by	my	 prim 	 ary 	 	school	math	teacher	in	tanzania	,	who	's	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	scottish	 lad 	 y 	 	who	i	still	stay	in	touch	with	.
and	she	's	now	in	her	80s	.
and	when	i	try	to	explain	my	work	to	her	,	she	 wave 	 d 	 	away	all	the	 detail 	 s 	 	,	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	neil	,	there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	one	question	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 matter 	 s 	 	.
what	 bang 	 ed 	 	?	``
``	 every 	 one 	 	 talk 	 s 	 	about	the	big	bang	.	what	 bang 	 ed 	 	?	``
and	she	's	right	.	it	's	a	question	we	've	all	 be 	 en 	 	 avoid 	 ing 	 	.
the	standard	 explan 	 ation 	 	is	that	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 some 	 how 	 	 sp 	 rang 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 exist 	 ence 	 	,	full	of	a	strange	kind	of	energy	--	 infla 	 tion 	 ary 	 	energy	--	which	 ble 	 w 	 	it	up	.
but	the	 puzzl 	 e 	 	of	why	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 emerge 	 d 	 	in	that	peculiar	state	is	 complete 	 ly 	 	 un 	 solve 	 d 	 	.
now	,	i	 work 	 ed 	 	on	that	 theor 	 y 	 	for	a	while	,	with	stephen	 hawk 	 ing 	 	and	 other 	 s 	 	.
but	then	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	explore	 an 	 other 	 	 alter 	 native 	 	.
the	 alter 	 native 	 	is	that	the	big	bang	was	n't	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 exist 	 ed 	 	before	the	bang	,	and	the	bang	was	just	a	violent	event	in	a	pre	-	 exist 	 ing 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
well	,	 th 	 is 	 	 possibil 	 ity 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 suggest 	 ed 	 	by	the	 lat 	 est 	 	 the 	 ories 	 	,	the	 un 	 ified 	 	 the 	 ories 	 	,	which	try	to	explain	all	 t 	 hose 	 	18	free	 parameter 	 s 	 	in	a	single	 frame 	 work 	 	,	which	will	 hope 	 fully 	 	predict	all	of	them	.
and	i	'll	just	share	a	cartoon	of	 th 	 is 	 	idea	here	.
it	's	all	i	can	convey	.	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	these	 the 	 ories 	 	,	there	are	extra	 dimension 	 s 	 	of	space	,	not	just	the	three	we	're	familiar	with	,	but	at	every	point	in	the	room	there	are	more	 dimension 	 s 	 	.
and	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	there	's	one	 ra 	 ther 	 	strange	one	,	in	the	most	elegant	 un 	 ified 	 	 the 	 ories 	 	we	have	.	the	strange	one	 look 	 s 	 	 like 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	:	that	we	live	in	a	three	-	dimensional	world	.
we	live	in	one	of	these	 world 	 s 	 	,	and	i	can	 on 	 ly 	 	show	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	sheet	,	but	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	three	-	dimensional	.	and	a	 tin 	 y 	 	distance	away	,	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	sheet	,	 al 	 so 	 	three	-	dimensional	,	and	they	're	 separat 	 ed 	 	by	a	gap	.
the	gap	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 tin 	 y 	 	,	and	i	've	blown	it	up	so	you	can	see	it	.
but	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	a	 tin 	 y 	 	fraction	of	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	an	atomic	nucleus	.
i	wo	n't	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	 detail 	 s 	 	of	why	we	think	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	it	 come 	 s 	 	out	of	the	math	and	 try 	 ing 	 	to	explain	the	physics	that	we	know	.
well	,	i	got	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	me	that	it	was	an	obvious	question	.
which	is	,	what	 happen 	 s 	 	if	these	two	,	three	-	dimensional	 world 	 s 	 	should	 actual 	 ly 	 	collide	?
and	if	they	collide	,	it	would	look	a	lot	like	the	big	bang	.
but	it	's	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	different	than	in	the	 convention 	 al 	 	picture	.
the	 convention 	 al 	 	picture	of	the	big	bang	is	a	point	.
 every 	 thing 	 	 come 	 s 	 	out	of	a	point	;	you	have	infinite	density	.	and	all	the	 equ 	 ations 	 	break	down	.
no	hope	of	 de 	 s 	 crib 	 ing 	 	that	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	picture	,	you	'll	notice	,	the	bang	is	 extend 	 ed 	 	.	it	's	not	a	point	.
the	density	of	matter	is	 fin 	 ite 	 	,	and	we	have	a	chance	of	a	 consist 	 ent 	 	set	of	 equ 	 ations 	 	that	can	 de 	 scribe 	 	the	whole	process	.
so	,	to	cut	a	long	story	short	,	we	've	 explore 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 alter 	 native 	 	.
we	've	 show 	 n 	 	that	it	can	fit	all	of	the	data	that	we	have	about	the	 form 	 ation 	 	of	 galax 	 ies 	 	,	the	 fluctu 	 ations 	 	in	the	 micro 	 wave 	 	 back 	 ground 	 	.
 further 	 more 	 	,	there	's	an	 experiment 	 al 	 	way	to	tell	 th 	 is 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	,	 a 	 part 	 	from	the	 infla 	 tion 	 ary 	 	 explan 	 ation 	 	that	i	told	you	before	.
it	 involve 	 s 	 	 gravit 	 ation 	 al 	 	 wave 	 s 	 	.
and	in	 th 	 is 	 	scenario	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	was	the	big	bang	not	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	from	the	picture	,	it	can	happen	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	.
it	may	be	that	we	live	in	an	 end 	 less 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	both	in	space	and	in	time	.
and	there	've	 be 	 en 	 	 bang 	 s 	 	in	the	past	,	and	there	will	be	 bang 	 s 	 	in	the	future	.
and	 may 	 be 	 	we	live	in	an	 end 	 less 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
well	,	making	and	 test 	 ing 	 	 model 	 s 	 	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	,	for	me	,	the	best	way	i	have	of	 enjoy 	 ing 	 	and	 appreci 	 ating 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
we	need	to	make	the	best	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 model 	 s 	 	we	can	,	the	most	 consist 	 ent 	 	 one 	 s 	 	.
and	then	we	scrutinize	them	,	logically	and	with	data	.
and	we	try	to	 con 	 vince 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	--	we	 re 	 ally 	 	try	to	 con 	 vince 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	they	're	wrong	.
that	's	progress	:	when	we	prove	 thing 	 s 	 	wrong	.
and	 gradu 	 ally 	 	,	we	 hope 	 fully 	 	move	 close 	 r 	 	and	 close 	 r 	 	to	 understand 	 ing 	 	the	world	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	 pursue 	 d 	 	my	 care 	 er 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	was	 al 	 ways 	 	 gna 	 wing 	 	away	 in 	 side 	 	me	.
what	about	africa	?
what	about	 t 	 hose 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	i	'd	left	 be 	 hind 	 	?
 in 	 stead 	 	of	 develop 	 ing 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	'd	all	 hop 	 ed 	 	in	the	'60s	,	 thing 	 s 	 	had	gotten	 wo 	 rse 	 	.
africa	was	 grip 	 ped 	 	by	poverty	,	disease	and	war	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 graphical 	 ly 	 	 show 	 n 	 	by	the	worldmapper	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	and	project	.
and	so	the	idea	is	to	represent	each	country	on	a	map	,	but	scale	the	area	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	some	 quant 	 ity 	 	.
so	here	's	just	the	standard	area	map	of	the	world	.	by	the	way	,	africa	is	 ver 	 y 	 	large	.
and	the	next	map	now	 show 	 s 	 	africa	's	gdp	in	1960	,	around	the	time	of	 in 	 depend 	 ence 	 	for	 man 	 y 	 	african	 state 	 s 	 	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	1990	,	and	then	2002	.	and	here	's	a	 project 	 ion 	 	for	2015	.
big	 change 	 s 	 	are	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	the	world	,	but	they	're	not	 help 	 ing 	 	africa	.
what	about	africa	's	population	?	the	population	is	n't	out	of	proportion	to	 it 	 s 	 	area	,	but	africa	 lead 	 s 	 	the	world	in	 death 	 s 	 	from	often	 prevent 	 able 	 	 cause 	 s 	 	:	 mal 	 nutrition 	 	,	simple	 infect 	 ions 	 	and	birth	 complic 	 ations 	 	.
then	there	's	hiv	/	 aid 	 s 	 	.	and	then	there	are	 death 	 s 	 	from	war	.
ok	,	 current 	 ly 	 	there	are	45,000	people	a	month	 dy 	 ing 	 	in	the	congo	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 con 	 sequence 	 	of	the	war	there	over	 col 	 tan 	 	and	 diamond 	 s 	 	and	other	 thing 	 s 	 	.
it	's	still	going	on	.
what	about	africa	's	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	these	 problem 	 s 	 	?
well	,	here	's	the	number	of	 physician 	 s 	 	in	africa	.
here	's	the	number	of	people	in	 high 	 er 	 	education	.
and	here	--	most	 shock 	 ing 	 	to	me	--	the	number	of	scientific	research	 paper 	 s 	 	coming	out	of	africa	.
it	just	 do 	 es 	 	n't	exist	 scientific 	 ally 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 eloquent 	 ly 	 	 argu 	 ed 	 	at	ted	africa	:	that	all	of	the	aid	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	 give 	 n 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	 fail 	 ed 	 	to	put	africa	onto	 it 	 s 	 	own	two	feet	.
well	,	the	 transit 	 ion 	 	to	 demo 	 cracy 	 	in	south	africa	in	1994	was	 liter 	 ally 	 	a	dream	come	true	for	 man 	 y 	 	of	us	.
my	 parent 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	both	 elect 	 ed 	 	to	the	first	parliament	,	 a 	 long 	 side 	 	nelson	and	winnie	mandela	.	they	 we 	 re 	 	the	 on 	 ly 	 	other	couple	.
and	in	2001	,	i	took	a	research	 leav 	 e 	 	to	visit	them	.
and	while	i	was	 bus 	 y 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	--	i	was	 work 	 ing 	 	on	these	 coll 	 id 	 ing 	 	 world 	 s 	 	,	in	the	day	.
but	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	there	was	a	desperate	 short 	 age 	 	of	 skill 	 s 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	,	in	industry	,	in	government	,	in	education	.
the	ability	to	make	and	test	 model 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	essential	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	to	every	single	area	of	science	 to 	 day 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	to	modern	 socie 	 ty 	 	 it 	 self 	 	.
and	if	you	do	n't	have	math	,	you	're	not	going	to	enter	the	modern	age	.
so	i	had	an	idea	.	and	the	idea	was	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	.
the	idea	was	to	set	up	an	african	institute	for	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 science 	 s 	 	,	or	 aim 	 s 	 	.
and	let	's	recruit	 student 	 s 	 	from	the	whole	of	africa	,	 br 	 ing 	 	them	together	with	 lectur 	 ers 	 	from	all	over	the	world	,	and	we	'll	try	to	give	them	a	fantastic	education	.
well	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	cambridge	professor	,	i	had	 man 	 y 	 	 contact 	 s 	 	.
and	to	my	 astonish 	 ment 	 	,	they	 back 	 ed 	 	me	100	percent	.
they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	go	and	do	it	,	and	we	'll	come	and	 lectur 	 e 	 	.	``
and	i	 k 	 new 	 	it	would	be	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 f 	 un 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	 brilli 	 ant 	 	 student 	 s 	 	from	these	 count 	 ries 	 	--	where	they	do	n't	have	any	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	--	together	with	the	best	 lectur 	 ers 	 	in	the	world	--	who	i	 k 	 new 	 	would	come	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	interest	in	africa	--
and	put	them	together	and	just	let	the	 spark 	 s 	 	fly	.
so	we	 b 	 ought 	 	a	 der 	 elict 	 	hotel	near	cape	town	.
it	's	an	80	-	room	art	deco	hotel	from	the	1920s	.
the	area	was	kind	of	 seed 	 y 	 	,	so	we	got	an	80	-	room	hotel	for	100,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	building	.	we	 decide 	 d 	 	we	would	refurbish	it	and	then	put	out	the	word	:	we	're	going	to	start	the	best	math	institute	in	africa	in	 th 	 is 	 	hotel	.
well	,	the	new	south	africa	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	country	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	have	n't	 be 	 en 	 	there	,	you	should	go	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
and	we	 recruit 	 ed 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	staff	,	 high 	 ly 	 	 motiv 	 ated 	 	staff	.
the	other	thing	that	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	which	was	good	for	us	,	is	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
even	 th 	 ough 	 	the	 inter 	 net 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	expensive	all	over	africa	,	there	are	 inter 	 net 	 	 cafe 	 s 	 	 every 	 where 	 	.
and	bright	young	africans	are	desperate	to	join	the	global	community	,	to	be	 success 	 ful 	 	--	and	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 ambit 	 ious 	 	.
they	want	to	be	the	next	einstein	.
and	so	when	word	came	out	that	 aim 	 s 	 	was	 open 	 ing 	 	,	it	spread	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	via	 e 	 - 	 mail 	 	and	our	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
and	we	got	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 appli 	 cant 	 s 	 	.
well	,	we	designed	 aim 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	24	-	hour	 learn 	 ing 	 	environment	,	and	it	was	fantastic	to	start	a	university	from	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
you	have	to	 re 	 think 	 	,	what	is	the	university	for	?
and	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	.
so	we	designed	it	to	have	 inter 	 active 	 	 teach 	 ing 	 	.
no	 dro 	 ning 	 	on	at	the	 chalk 	 board 	 	.
we	 emphas 	 ize 	 	problem	-	solving	,	 work 	 ing 	 	in	 group 	 s 	 	,	every	student	 discover 	 ing 	 	and	 maxim 	 izing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	potential	and	not	chasing	 grade 	 s 	 	.
 every 	 one 	 	 live 	 s 	 	together	in	 th 	 is 	 	hotel	--	 lectur 	 ers 	 	and	 student 	 s 	 	--	and	it	's	not	surprising	at	all	to	find	an	 imp 	 romptu 	 	 tutor 	 ial 	 	at	1	a.m	.
the	 student 	 s 	 	do	n't	 usual 	 ly 	 	 leav 	 e 	 	the	computer	lab	till	2	or	3	a.m	.
and	then	they	're	up	 aga 	 in 	 	at	eight	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
 lectur 	 es 	 	,	problem	-	solving	and	so	on	.	it	's	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	place	.
we	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 emphas 	 ize 	 	 area 	 s 	 	of	great	relevance	to	africa	's	 develop 	 ment 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 area 	 s 	 	,	 scientist 	 s 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	in	africa	will	have	a	competitive	advantage	.
they	'll	publish	,	be	 invit 	 ed 	 	to	 con 	 ference 	 s 	 	.
they	'll	do	well	.	they	'll	have	 success 	 ful 	 	 care 	 ers 	 	.
and	 aim 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	well	.
here	is	a	list	of	last	year	's	 graduate 	 s 	 	,	 graduate 	 d 	 	in	june	,	and	what	they	're	 current 	 ly 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	--	48	of	them	.
and	where	they	are	is	 indic 	 ated 	 	over	here	.
and	where	they	've	gone	.	so	these	are	all	 post 	 graduate 	 	 student 	 s 	 	.
and	they	've	all	gone	on	to	master	's	and	ph.d.	 degree 	 s 	 	in	 excel 	 lent 	 	 place 	 s 	 	.
five	 student 	 s 	 	can	be	educated	at	 aim 	 s 	 	for	the	cost	of	 educ 	 ating 	 	one	in	the	u.s.	or	europe	.
but	more	 import 	 ant 	 	,	the	pan	-	african	student	body	is	a	 continu 	 al 	 	source	of	strength	,	 pri 	 de 	 	and	 commit 	 ment 	 	to	africa	.
we	 illustr 	 ate 	 	 aim 	 s 	 	'	progress	by	 color 	 ing 	 	in	the	 count 	 ries 	 	of	africa	.
so	here	you	can	see	 be 	 hind 	 	 th 	 is 	 	list	.
when	a	 count 	 y 	 	is	 color 	 ed 	 	yellow	,	we	've	 receiv 	 ed 	 	an	application	;	 o 	 range 	 	,	we	've	 accept 	 ed 	 	an	application	;	and	green	,	a	student	 ha 	 s 	 	 graduate 	 d 	 	.
so	here	is	where	we	 we 	 re 	 	after	the	first	 gradu 	 ation 	 	in	2004	.
and	we	set	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	a	goal	of	 turn 	 ing 	 	the	continent	green	.
so	there	's	2005	,	-6	,	-7	,	-8	.
we	're	well	on	the	way	to	 achiev 	 ing 	 	our	 initi 	 al 	 	goal	.
we	had	some	of	the	 student 	 s 	 	 film 	 ed 	 	at	home	before	they	came	to	 aim 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'll	just	show	you	one	.
tendai	mugwagwa	:	my	name	is	tendai	mugwagwa	.
i	have	a	bachelor	of	science	with	an	education	degree	.
i	will	be	 attend 	 ing 	 	 aim 	 s 	 	.
my	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	the	course	is	that	it	 cover 	 s 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	a	lot	.
you	know	,	from	physics	to	medicine	,	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	 epidemio 	 logy 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 model 	 ing 	 	.
neil	turok	:	so	tendai	came	to	 aim 	 s 	 	and	did	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.
and	i	'll	let	her	take	it	from	there	.
tm	:	my	name	is	tendai	mugwagwa	and	i	was	a	student	at	 aim 	 s 	 	in	2003	and	2004	.
after	 leav 	 ing 	 	 aim 	 s 	 	,	i	went	on	to	do	a	master	's	in	 appli 	 ed 	 	 mathematic 	 s 	 	at	the	university	of	cape	town	in	south	africa	.
after	that	,	i	came	to	the	netherlands	where	i	'm	now	 do 	 ing 	 	a	ph.d.	in	 theoretic 	 al 	 	 immuno 	 logy 	 	.
professor	:	tendai	is	 work 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 in 	 dependent 	 ly 	 	.
she	 communicate 	 s 	 	well	with	the	 immuno 	 logists 	 	at	the	hospital	.	so	all	in	all	i	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	ph.d.	student	from	south	africa	.
so	i	'm	happy	she	's	here	.
nt	:	 an 	 other 	 	student	in	the	first	year	of	 aim 	 s 	 	was	shehu	.
and	he	's	 show 	 n 	 	here	with	his	 favor 	 ite 	 	high	school	teacher	.
and	then	 enter 	 ing 	 	university	in	 north 	 ern 	 	nigeria	.
and	after	 aim 	 s 	 	,	shehu	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	high	-	energy	physics	,	and	he	came	to	cambridge	.
he	's	about	to	finish	his	ph.d.	,	and	he	was	 film 	 ed 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	with	 some 	 one 	 	you	all	know	.
shehu	:	and	from	there	we	will	be	able	to	,	 hope 	 fully 	 	,	make	better	 predict 	 ions 	 	and	then	we	 compar 	 e 	 	it	to	the	graph	and	 al 	 so 	 	make	some	 predict 	 ions 	 	.
stephen	 hawk 	 ing 	 	:	that	is	nice	.
nt	:	here	are	the	current	 student 	 s 	 	at	 aim 	 s 	 	.	there	are	53	of	them	from	20	different	 count 	 ries 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	20	women	.
so	now	i	'm	going	to	get	to	my	ted	business	.
well	,	we	had	a	party	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	africa	--	we	have	good	 part 	 ies 	 	in	africa	.	and	last	month	,	they	threw	a	surprise	party	for	me	.
here	's	 some 	 body 	 	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	.
i	want	to	point	out	a	few	other	 exception 	 al 	 	people	in	 th 	 is 	 	picture	.
so	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	party	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	they	're	 complete 	 ly 	 	 e 	 clip 	 s 	 ing 	 	me	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	ezra	.	she	's	from	darfur	.	she	's	a	physicist	,	and	 some 	 how 	 	 stay 	 s 	 	 smil 	 ing 	 	,	in	spite	of	 every 	 thing 	 	going	on	back	home	.
but	she	 want 	 s 	 	to	 continu 	 e 	 	in	physics	,	and	she	's	 do 	 ing 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	well	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	lydia	.	lydia	is	the	first	ever	woman	to	graduate	in	 mathematic 	 s 	 	in	the	central	african	 re 	 public 	 	.
and	she	's	now	at	 aim 	 s 	 	.
so	now	let	me	get	to	our	ted	wish	.
well	,	it	's	not	my	ted	wish	;	it	's	our	wish	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	've	 al 	 ready 	 	 gather 	 ed 	 	.
and	our	wish	 ha 	 s 	 	two	 part 	 s 	 	:	one	is	a	dream	and	the	other	's	a	plan	.	ok	.
our	ted	dream	is	that	the	next	einstein	will	be	african	.
in	 striv 	 ing 	 	for	the	 height 	 s 	 	of	creative	 gen 	 ius 	 	,	we	want	to	give	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	the	 motiv 	 ation 	 	,	the	 encourag 	 ement 	 	and	the	courage	to	obtain	the	high	-	level	 skill 	 s 	 	they	need	to	help	africa	.
among	them	will	be	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 brilli 	 ant 	 	 scientist 	 s 	 	--	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	of	that	from	what	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	at	 aim 	 s 	 	--	they	'll	 al 	 so 	 	be	the	african	 gate 	 s 	 	,	brins	and	 page 	 s 	 	of	the	future	.
well	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	we	 al 	 so 	 	have	a	plan	.	and	our	plan	is	 quit 	 e 	 	simple	.
 aim 	 s 	 	is	now	a	proven	model	.
and	what	we	need	to	do	is	to	replicate	it	.
we	want	to	roll	out	15	 aim 	 s 	 	 center 	 s 	 	in	the	next	five	 year 	 s 	 	,	all	over	africa	.
each	will	have	a	pan	-	african	student	body	,	but	 special 	 ize 	 	in	a	different	area	of	science	.
we	want	to	use	science	to	 over 	 come 	 	the	national	and	cultural	 bar 	 rier 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 do 	 es 	 	at	 aim 	 s 	 	.
and	we	want	to	add	 element 	 s 	 	to	the	curriculum	.
we	want	to	add	 entrepreneur 	 ship 	 	and	policy	 skill 	 s 	 	.
the	 expand 	 ed 	 	 aim 	 s 	 	will	be	a	 cohere 	 nt 	 	pan	-	african	institution	,	and	 it 	 s 	 	 graduate 	 s 	 	will	form	a	 power 	 ful 	 	network	,	 work 	 ing 	 	together	for	peace	and	progress	 a 	 cross 	 	the	continent	.
over	the	last	year	,	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 visit 	 ing 	 	 s 	 ites 	 	in	africa	,	looking	at	potential	 s 	 ites 	 	for	new	 aim 	 s 	 	 center 	 s 	 	.
and	here	are	the	 one 	 s 	 	we	've	 select 	 ed 	 	.
and	each	of	these	 center 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	strong	local	team	,	each	is	in	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	place	,	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	place	,	which	 inter 	 national 	 	 lectur 	 ers 	 	will	be	happy	to	visit	.
and	our	 partner 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	africa	are	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 enthusiast 	 ic 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
 every 	 one 	 	 want 	 s 	 	an	 aim 	 s 	 	center	in	 the 	 ir 	 	country	.
and	last	november	,	the	 con 	 ference 	 	of	all	the	african	 mini 	 sters 	 	of	science	and	technology	,	held	in	mombasa	,	 call 	 ed 	 	for	a	 comprehens 	 ive 	 	plan	to	roll	out	 aim 	 s 	 	.
so	we	have	 politic 	 al 	 	support	right	 a 	 cross 	 	the	continent	.
it	wo	n't	be	easy	.
at	every	 s 	 ite 	 	there	will	be	huge	 challeng 	 es 	 	.
local	 scientist 	 s 	 	must	play	 lead 	 ing 	 	 role 	 s 	 	and	 government 	 s 	 	must	be	 persuad 	 ed 	 	to	buy	in	.
 condition 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	,	but	we	can	not	afford	to	 com 	 promise 	 	on	 t 	 hose 	 	 principle 	 s 	 	which	made	 aim 	 s 	 	work	.
and	we	summarize	them	 th 	 is 	 	way	:	the	 institute 	 s 	 	have	got	to	be	relevant	,	 innov 	 ative 	 	,	cost	-	effective	and	high	quality	.	why	?
 be 	 cause 	 	we	want	africa	to	be	rich	.
easy	to	remember	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	 rule 	 s 	 	we	need	.
so	,	just	in	 end 	 ing 	 	,	let	me	say	the	 on 	 ly 	 	people	who	can	fix	africa	are	 talent 	 ed 	 	young	africans	.
by	 un 	 lock 	 ing 	 	and	 nurtur 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	creative	potential	,	we	can	create	a	step	change	in	africa	's	future	.	over	time	,	they	will	 con 	 tribute 	 	to	african	 develop 	 ment 	 	and	to	science	in	ways	we	can	 on 	 ly 	 	imagine	.
thank	you	.
