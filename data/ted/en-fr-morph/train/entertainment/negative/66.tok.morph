good	 morn 	 ing 	 	.	how	are	you	?	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	great	,	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	it	?
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	blown	away	by	the	whole	thing	.
in	fact	,	i	'm	 leav 	 ing 	 	.
there	have	 be 	 en 	 	three	 theme 	 s 	 	,	have	n't	there	,	running	through	the	 con 	 ference 	 	,	which	are	relevant	to	what	i	want	to	talk	about	.
one	is	the	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	evidence	of	human	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	in	all	of	the	 present 	 ations 	 	that	we	've	had	and	in	all	of	the	people	here	.	just	the	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	it	and	the	range	of	it	.	the	second	is	that	it	's	put	us	in	a	place	where	we	have	no	idea	what	's	going	to	happen	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	future	.	no	idea	how	 th 	 is 	 	may	play	out	.
i	have	an	interest	in	education	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	what	i	find	is	 every 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	an	interest	in	education	.
do	n't	you	?	i	find	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
if	you	're	at	a	 d 	 inner 	 	party	,	and	you	say	you	work	in	education	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	you	're	not	often	at	 d 	 inner 	 	 part 	 ies 	 	,	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	if	you	work	in	education	.
you	're	not	 ask 	 ed 	 	.
and	you	're	never	 ask 	 ed 	 	back	,	 cur 	 iously 	 	.	that	's	strange	to	me	.
but	if	you	are	,	and	you	say	to	 some 	 body 	 	,	you	know	,	they	say	,	``	what	do	you	do	?	``
and	you	say	you	work	in	education	,	you	can	see	the	blood	run	from	 the 	 ir 	 	face	.	they	're	like	,	``	oh	my	god	,	``	you	know	,	``	why	me	?	my	one	night	out	all	week	.	``
but	if	you	ask	about	 the 	 ir 	 	education	,	they	pin	you	to	the	wall	.	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 go 	 es 	 	deep	with	people	,	am	i	right	?
like	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	and	money	and	other	 thing 	 s 	 	.
i	have	a	big	interest	in	education	,	and	i	think	we	all	do	.
we	have	a	huge	 vest 	 ed 	 	interest	in	it	,	 part 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	education	that	's	 me 	 ant 	 	to	take	us	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	future	that	we	ca	n't	grasp	.
if	you	think	of	it	,	children	 start 	 ing 	 	school	 th 	 is 	 	year	will	be	 ret 	 ir 	 ing 	 	in	2065	.	 no 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	clue	--	 de 	 spite 	 	all	the	 expert 	 ise 	 	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	on	 para 	 de 	 	for	the	past	four	 day 	 s 	 	--	what	the	world	will	look	like	in	five	 year 	 s 	 	'	time	.	and	yet	we	're	 me 	 ant 	 	to	be	 educ 	 ating 	 	them	for	it	.	so	the	 un 	 predict 	 ability 	 	,	i	think	,	is	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	.
and	the	third	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	we	've	all	 agree 	 d 	 	,	 non 	 e 	 the 	 less 	 	,	on	the	 re 	 ally 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 cap 	 a 	 cities 	 	that	children	have	--	 the 	 ir 	 	 cap 	 a 	 cities 	 	for	 innov 	 ation 	 	.	i	mean	,	sirena	last	night	was	a	marvel	,	was	n't	she	?	just	 see 	 ing 	 	what	she	could	do	.
and	she	's	 exception 	 al 	 	,	but	i	think	she	's	not	,	so	to	speak	,	 exception 	 al 	 	in	the	whole	of	 child 	 hood 	 	.
what	you	have	there	is	a	person	of	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 d 	 ed 	 ic 	 ation 	 	who	found	a	talent	.	and	my	 content 	 ion 	 	is	,	all	 kid 	 s 	 	have	tremendous	 talent 	 s 	 	.
and	we	squander	them	,	 pre 	 tty 	 	 ruth 	 lessly 	 	.
so	i	want	to	talk	about	education	and	i	want	to	talk	about	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	.	my	 content 	 ion 	 	is	that	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	now	is	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	in	education	 a 	 s 	 	 liter 	 acy 	 	,	and	we	should	treat	it	with	the	same	 stat 	 us 	 	.
thank	you	.	that	was	it	,	by	the	way	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.	so	,	15	 minute 	 s 	 	left	.
well	,	i	was	born	...	no	.
i	heard	a	great	story	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	--	i	love	 tell 	 ing 	 	it	--	of	a	little	girl	who	was	in	a	 draw 	 ing 	 	 less 	 on 	 	.	she	was	six	and	she	was	at	the	back	,	 draw 	 ing 	 	,	and	the	teacher	 s 	 aid 	 	 th 	 is 	 	little	girl	 hard 	 ly 	 	ever	paid	attention	,	and	in	 th 	 is 	 	 draw 	 ing 	 	 less 	 on 	 	she	did	.
the	teacher	was	 fascinate 	 d 	 	and	she	went	over	to	her	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	are	you	 draw 	 ing 	 	?	``
and	the	girl	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'm	 draw 	 ing 	 	a	picture	of	god	.	``
and	the	teacher	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	but	 no 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	what	god	 look 	 s 	 	like	.	``
and	the	girl	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	they	will	in	a	minute	.	``
when	my	son	was	four	in	england	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	he	was	four	 every 	 where 	 	,	to	be	honest	.
if	we	're	 be 	 ing 	 	strict	about	it	,	 where 	 ver 	 	he	went	,	he	was	four	that	year	.
he	was	in	the	nativity	play	.
do	you	remember	the	story	?	no	,	it	was	big	.
it	was	a	big	story	.	mel	gibson	did	the	 s 	 equ 	 el 	 	.
you	may	have	 s 	 een 	 	it	:	``	nativity	ii	.	``	but	james	got	the	part	of	joseph	,	which	we	 we 	 re 	 	 thrill 	 ed 	 	about	.
we	 consider 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	to	be	one	of	the	lead	 part 	 s 	 	.
we	had	the	place	 cram 	 med 	 	full	of	 agent 	 s 	 	in	t	-	 shirt 	 s 	 	:	``	james	robinson	is	joseph	!	``
he	did	n't	have	to	speak	,	but	you	know	the	bit	where	the	three	 king 	 s 	 	come	in	.	they	come	in	 bear 	 ing 	 	 gift 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 br 	 ing 	 	gold	,	 frank 	 incense 	 	and	myrhh	.
 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.	we	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	and	i	think	they	just	went	out	of	sequence	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	the	little	boy	 after 	 ward 	 	and	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	ok	with	that	?	``	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	,	why	?	was	that	wrong	?	``
they	just	 s 	 witch 	 ed 	 	,	that	was	it	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	the	three	 boy 	 s 	 	came	in	--	four	-	year	-	olds	with	tea	 to 	 wel 	 s 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 head 	 s 	 	--	and	they	put	these	boxes	down	,	and	the	first	boy	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	 br 	 ing 	 	you	gold	.	``
and	the	second	boy	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	 br 	 ing 	 	you	myrhh	.	``
and	the	third	boy	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	frank	 s 	 ent 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.	``	what	these	 thing 	 s 	 	have	in	common	is	that	 kid 	 s 	 	will	take	a	chance	.
if	they	do	n't	know	,	they	'll	have	a	go	.
am	i	right	?	they	're	not	 frighten 	 ed 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	wrong	.
now	,	i	do	n't	mean	to	say	that	 be 	 ing 	 	wrong	is	the	same	thing	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	creative	.
what	we	do	know	is	,	if	you	're	not	prepared	to	be	wrong	,	you	'll	never	come	up	with	 any 	 thing 	 	original	--
if	you	're	not	prepared	to	be	wrong	.	and	by	the	time	they	get	to	be	 adult 	 s 	 	,	most	 kid 	 s 	 	have	lost	that	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	.
they	have	 be 	 come 	 	 frighten 	 ed 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	wrong	.
and	we	run	our	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	by	the	way	.
we	 stigma 	 tize 	 	 mistak 	 es 	 	.	and	we	're	now	running	national	education	 system 	 s 	 	where	 mistak 	 es 	 	are	the	worst	thing	you	can	make	.
and	the	result	is	that	we	are	 educ 	 ating 	 	people	out	of	 the 	 ir 	 	creative	 cap 	 a 	 cities 	 	.	picasso	once	 s 	 aid 	 	 th 	 is 	 	--	he	 s 	 aid 	 	that	all	children	are	born	 artist 	 s 	 	.
the	problem	is	to	remain	an	artist	 a 	 s 	 	we	grow	up	.	i	 believ 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 passionate 	 ly 	 	,	that	we	do	n't	grow	 in 	 to 	 	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	,
we	grow	out	of	it	.	or	 ra 	 ther 	 	,	we	get	educated	out	if	it	.
so	why	is	 th 	 is 	 	?
i	lived	in	stratford	-	on	-	avon	 un 	 til 	 	about	five	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
in	fact	,	we	 move 	 d 	 	from	stratford	to	los	angeles	.
so	you	can	imagine	what	a	 seam 	 less 	 	 transit 	 ion 	 	that	was	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	we	lived	in	a	place	 call 	 ed 	 	snitterfield	,	just	 out 	 side 	 	stratford	,	which	is	where	shakespeare	's	father	was	born	.	are	you	 s 	 truck 	 	by	a	new	thought	?	i	was	.
you	do	n't	think	of	shakespeare	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	father	,	do	you	?
do	you	?	 be 	 cause 	 	you	do	n't	think	of	shakespeare	 be 	 ing 	 	a	child	,	do	you	?
shakespeare	 be 	 ing 	 	seven	?	i	never	thought	of	it	.	i	mean	,	he	was	seven	at	some	point	.	he	was	in	 some 	 body 	 	's	english	class	,	was	n't	he	?	how	 annoy 	 ing 	 	would	that	be	?
``	must	try	 hard 	 er 	 	.	``	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 ent 	 	to	bed	by	his	dad	,	you	know	,	to	shakespeare	,	``	go	to	bed	,	now	,	``
to	william	shakespeare	,	``	and	put	the	pencil	down	.
and	stop	 s 	 peaking 	 	like	that	.	it	's	 con 	 fusing 	 	 every 	 body 	 	.	``
 any 	 way 	 	,	we	 move 	 d 	 	from	stratford	to	los	angeles	,	and	i	just	want	to	say	a	word	about	the	 transit 	 ion 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
my	son	did	n't	want	to	come	.
i	've	got	two	 kid 	 s 	 	.	he	's	21	now	;	my	daughter	's	16	.
he	did	n't	want	to	come	to	los	angeles	.	he	 love 	 d 	 	it	,	but	he	had	a	girlfriend	in	england	.	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	love	of	his	life	,	sarah	.
he	'd	known	her	for	a	month	.
mind	you	,	they	'd	had	 the 	 ir 	 	fourth	 annivers 	 ary 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	a	long	time	when	you	're	16	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	he	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 up 	 set 	 	on	the	plane	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'll	never	find	 an 	 other 	 	girl	like	sarah	.	``
and	we	 we 	 re 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	 pleas 	 ed 	 	about	that	,	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	she	was	the	main	reason	we	 we 	 re 	 	 leav 	 ing 	 	the	country	.
but	 some 	 thing 	 	 strike 	 s 	 	you	when	you	move	to	america	and	when	you	travel	around	the	world	:	every	education	system	on	earth	 ha 	 s 	 	the	same	 hierarch 	 y 	 	of	 subject 	 s 	 	.
every	one	.	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	where	you	go	.
you	'd	think	it	would	be	 other 	 wise 	 	,	but	it	is	n't	.
at	the	top	are	 mathematic 	 s 	 	and	 language 	 s 	 	,	then	the	 human 	 ities 	 	,	and	the	bottom	are	the	 art 	 s 	 	.
 every 	 where 	 	on	earth	.
and	in	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	every	system	too	,	there	's	a	 hierarch 	 y 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	 art 	 s 	 	.
art	and	music	are	 normal 	 ly 	 	 give 	 n 	 	a	 high 	 er 	 	 stat 	 us 	 	in	 school 	 s 	 	than	drama	and	dance	.	there	is	n't	an	education	system	on	the	planet	that	 teach 	 es 	 	dance	 every 	 day 	 	to	children	the	way	we	teach	them	 mathematic 	 s 	 	.	why	?
why	not	?	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	 ra 	 ther 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
i	think	math	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	but	so	is	dance	.
children	dance	all	the	time	if	they	're	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	,	we	all	do	.
we	all	have	bodies	,	do	n't	we	?	did	i	 mis 	 s 	 	a	 meet 	 ing 	 	?
 truth 	 fully 	 	,	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	,	 a 	 s 	 	children	grow	up	,	we	start	to	 educ 	 ate 	 	them	 progress 	 ively 	 	from	the	waist	up	.	and	then	we	focus	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 head 	 s 	 	.
and	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	to	one	side	.
if	you	 we 	 re 	 	to	visit	education	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	alien	,	and	say	``	what	's	it	for	,	public	education	?	``
i	think	you	'd	have	to	conclude	--	if	you	look	at	the	 out 	 put 	 	,	who	 re 	 ally 	 	 succeed 	 s 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	,	who	 do 	 es 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	that	they	should	,	who	 get 	 s 	 	all	the	brownie	 point 	 s 	 	,	who	are	the	 winner 	 s 	 	--	i	think	you	'd	have	to	conclude	the	whole	purpose	of	public	education	 through 	 out 	 	the	world	is	to	produce	university	 professor 	 s 	 	.	is	n't	it	?
they	're	the	people	who	come	out	the	top	.
and	i	used	to	be	one	,	so	there	.
and	i	like	university	 professor 	 s 	 	,	but	you	know	,	we	should	n't	hold	them	up	 a 	 s 	 	the	high	-	water	mark	of	all	human	 achiev 	 ement 	 	.
they	're	just	a	form	of	life	,	 an 	 other 	 	form	of	life	.	but	they	're	 ra 	 ther 	 	 cur 	 ious 	 	,	and	i	say	 th 	 is 	 	out	of	 affect 	 ion 	 	for	them	.
there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	 cur 	 ious 	 	about	 professor 	 s 	 	in	my	experience	--	not	all	of	them	,	but	 typical 	 ly 	 	--	they	live	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 head 	 s 	 	.
they	live	up	there	,	and	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	to	one	side	.
they	're	 dis 	 embodi 	 ed 	 	,	you	know	,	in	a	kind	of	 liter 	 al 	 	way	.
they	look	 up 	 on 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	body	 a 	 s 	 	a	form	of	transport	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 head 	 s 	 	,	do	n't	they	?
it	's	a	way	of	 get 	 ting 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	head	to	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
if	you	want	real	evidence	of	out	-	of	-	body	 experience 	 s 	 	,	by	the	way	,	get	 your 	 self 	 	 a 	 long 	 	to	a	 resident 	 ial 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	of	senior	 academic 	 s 	 	,	and	pop	 in 	 to 	 	the	 dis 	 co 	 the 	 que 	 	on	the	final	night	.
and	there	you	will	see	it	--	grown	men	and	women	 writ 	 h 	 ing 	 	 un 	 controll 	 ably 	 	,	off	the	beat	,	 wait 	 ing 	 	 un 	 til 	 	it	 end 	 s 	 	so	they	can	go	home	and	write	a	paper	about	it	.
now	our	education	system	is	 pre 	 dica 	 ted 	 	on	the	idea	of	academic	ability	.
and	there	's	a	reason	.
the	whole	system	was	 invent 	 ed 	 	--	around	the	world	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	no	public	 system 	 s 	 	of	education	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	before	the	19th	century	.
they	all	came	 in 	 to 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	to	meet	the	 need 	 s 	 	of	 industrial 	 ism 	 	.
so	the	 hierarch 	 y 	 	is	 root 	 ed 	 	on	two	 idea 	 s 	 	.
number	one	,	that	the	most	 use 	 ful 	 	 subject 	 s 	 	for	work	are	at	the	top	.	so	you	 we 	 re 	 	 prob 	 ably 	 	 steer 	 ed 	 	 benign 	 ly 	 	away	from	 thing 	 s 	 	at	school	when	you	 we 	 re 	 	a	kid	,	 thing 	 s 	 	you	 like 	 d 	 	,	on	the	 ground 	 s 	 	that	you	would	never	get	a	job	 do 	 ing 	 	that	.	is	that	right	?
do	n't	do	music	,	you	're	not	going	to	be	a	 music 	 ian 	 	;	do	n't	do	art	,	you	wo	n't	be	an	artist	.
benign	 ad 	 vice 	 	--	now	,	 pro 	 found 	 ly 	 	 mistak 	 en 	 	.	the	whole	world	is	 engulf 	 ed 	 	in	a	revolution	.
and	the	second	is	academic	ability	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	come	to	dominate	our	view	of	 intellig 	 ence 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 un 	 ive 	 rs 	 ities 	 	designed	the	system	in	 the 	 ir 	 	image	.
if	you	think	of	it	,	the	whole	system	of	public	education	around	the	world	is	a	 pro 	 tract 	 ed 	 	process	of	university	 en 	 trance 	 	.
and	the	 con 	 sequence 	 	is	that	 man 	 y 	 	 high 	 ly 	 	 talent 	 ed 	 	,	 brilli 	 ant 	 	,	creative	people	think	they	're	not	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	thing	they	 we 	 re 	 	good	at	at	school	was	n't	 valu 	 ed 	 	,	or	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 stigma 	 t 	 ized 	 	.
and	i	think	we	ca	n't	afford	to	go	on	that	way	.
in	the	next	30	 year 	 s 	 	,	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	unesco	,	more	people	 world 	 wide 	 	will	be	 gradu 	 ating 	 	through	education	than	since	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
more	people	,	and	it	's	the	combination	of	all	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	've	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	--	technology	and	 it 	 s 	 	 transform 	 ation 	 	effect	on	work	,	and	 demo 	 graphy 	 	and	the	huge	explosion	in	population	.
 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	 degree 	 s 	 	are	n't	worth	 any 	 thing 	 	.	is	n't	that	true	?
when	i	was	a	student	,	if	you	had	a	degree	,	you	had	a	job	.
if	you	did	n't	have	a	job	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	you	did	n't	want	one	.
and	i	did	n't	want	one	,	 frank 	 ly 	 	.
but	now	 kid 	 s 	 	with	 degree 	 s 	 	are	often	 head 	 ing 	 	home	to	carry	on	 play 	 ing 	 	video	 game 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	need	an	ma	where	the	previous	job	 requir 	 ed 	 	a	ba	,	and	now	you	need	a	phd	for	the	other	.
it	's	a	process	of	academic	 infla 	 tion 	 	.
and	it	 indic 	 ates 	 	the	whole	structure	of	education	is	shifting	 be 	 neath 	 	our	feet	.	we	need	to	 radical 	 ly 	 	 re 	 think 	 	our	view	of	 intellig 	 ence 	 	.
we	know	three	 thing 	 s 	 	about	 intellig 	 ence 	 	.
one	,	it	's	 divers 	 e 	 	.	we	think	about	the	world	in	all	the	ways	that	we	experience	it	.	we	think	 visual 	 ly 	 	,	we	think	in	sound	,	we	think	 kinesthetic 	 ally 	 	.	we	think	in	abstract	 term 	 s 	 	,	we	think	in	 move 	 ment 	 	.
 second 	 ly 	 	,	 intellig 	 ence 	 	is	dynamic	.
if	you	look	at	the	 interact 	 ions 	 	of	a	human	brain	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	heard	 yester 	 day 	 	from	a	number	of	 present 	 ations 	 	,	 intellig 	 ence 	 	is	 wonder 	 fully 	 	 inter 	 active 	 	.
the	brain	is	n't	 divid 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 compartment 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	--	which	i	define	 a 	 s 	 	the	process	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	original	 idea 	 s 	 	that	have	value	--	more	often	than	not	 come 	 s 	 	about	through	the	 interact 	 ion 	 	of	different	disciplinary	ways	of	 see 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
the	brain	is	 intentional 	 ly 	 	--	by	the	way	,	there	's	a	shaft	of	 nerve 	 s 	 	that	 join 	 s 	 	the	two	 halv 	 es 	 	of	the	brain	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 corp 	 us 	 	 call 	 o 	 sum 	 	.	it	's	 thick 	 er 	 	in	women	.
 follow 	 ing 	 	off	from	helen	 yester 	 day 	 	,	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	why	women	are	better	at	multi	-	tasking	.
 be 	 cause 	 	you	are	,	are	n't	you	?
there	's	a	raft	of	research	,	but	i	know	it	from	my	personal	life	.
if	my	wife	is	 cook 	 ing 	 	a	meal	at	home	--	which	is	not	often	,	 thank 	 fully 	 	.
but	you	know	,	she	's	 do 	 ing 	 	--	no	,	she	's	good	at	some	 thing 	 s 	 	--	but	if	she	's	 cook 	 ing 	 	,	you	know	,	she	's	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	people	on	the	phone	,	she	's	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	the	 kid 	 s 	 	,	she	's	 paint 	 ing 	 	the	 ceil 	 ing 	 	,	she	's	 do 	 ing 	 	open	-	heart	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	over	here	.
if	i	'm	 cook 	 ing 	 	,	the	door	is	shut	,	the	 kid 	 s 	 	are	out	,	the	phone	's	on	the	hook	,	if	she	 come 	 s 	 	in	i	get	 annoy 	 ed 	 	.
i	say	,	``	terry	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	,	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	fry	an	egg	in	here	.	give	me	a	break	.	``
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	you	know	that	old	 philosoph 	 ical 	 	thing	,	if	a	tree	 fall 	 s 	 	in	a	forest	and	 no 	 body 	 	 hear 	 s 	 	it	,	did	it	happen	?	remember	that	old	 chest 	 nut 	 	?
i	saw	a	great	t	-	shirt	 re 	 ally 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	which	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	if	a	man	 speak 	 s 	 	his	mind	in	a	forest	,	and	no	woman	 hear 	 s 	 	him	,	is	he	still	wrong	?	``
and	the	third	thing	about	 intellig 	 ence 	 	is	,	it	's	distinct	.	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	a	new	book	at	the	moment	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 epiph 	 any 	 	,	``	which	is	based	on	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 interview 	 s 	 	with	people	about	how	they	 discover 	 ed 	 
 the 	 ir 	 	talent	.	i	'm	 fascinate 	 d 	 	by	how	people	got	to	be	there	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 prompt 	 ed 	 	by	a	conversation	i	had	with	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	woman	who	 may 	 be 	 	most	people	have	never	heard	of	;	she	's	 call 	 ed 	 	gillian	lynne	--	have	you	heard	of	her	?	some	have	.	she	's	a	 choreograph 	 er 	 	and	 every 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	her	work	.
she	did	``	 cat 	 s 	 	``	and	``	phantom	of	the	opera	.	``	she	's	 wonder 	 ful 	 	.	i	used	to	be	on	the	board	of	the	royal	ballet	in	england	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	gillian	and	i	had	lunch	one	day	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	gillian	,	how	'd	you	get	to	be	a	 danc 	 er 	 	?	``	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	it	was	 interest 	 ing 	 	;	when	she	was	at	school	,	she	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 hope 	 less 	 	.	and	the	school	,	in	the	'30s	,	wrote	to	her	 parent 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	think	gillian	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 learn 	 ing 	 	 dis 	 order 	 	.	``	she	could	n't	 concent 	 rate 	 	;	she	was	fidgeting	.	i	think	now	they	'd	say	she	had	adhd	.	would	n't	you	?	but	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	1930s	,	and	adhd	had	n't	 be 	 en 	 	 invent 	 ed 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	.
it	was	n't	an	 avail 	 able 	 	condition	.
people	 we 	 re 	 	n't	aware	they	could	have	that	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	she	went	to	see	 th 	 is 	 	 special 	 ist 	 	.	so	,	 th 	 is 	 	oak	-	paneled	room	,
and	she	was	there	with	her	mother	,	and	she	was	led	and	 s 	 at 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	chair	at	the	end	,	and	she	 s 	 at 	 	on	her	 hand 	 s 	 	for	20	 minute 	 s 	 	while	 th 	 is 	 	man	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	her	mother	about	all	the	 problem 	 s 	 	gillian	was	 hav 	 ing 	 	at	school	.	and	at	the	end	of	it	--	 be 	 cause 	 	she	was	 disturb 	 ing 	 	people	;	her	 home 	 work 	 	was	 al 	 ways 	 	late	;	and	so	on	,	little	kid	of	eight	--	in	the	end	,	the	doctor	went	and	 s 	 at 	 	next	to	gillian	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	gillian	,	i	've	 listen 	 ed 	 	to	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	that	your	mother	's	told	me	,	and	i	need	to	speak	to	her	 private 	 ly 	 	.	``	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	wait	here	.	we	'll	be	back	;	we	wo	n't	be	 ver 	 y 	 	long	,	``

now	,	i	think	...	what	i	think	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	al	gore	spoke	the	other	night	about	 eco 	 logy 	 	and	the	revolution	that	was	 trigger 	 ed 	 	by	rachel	carson	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	our	 on 	 ly 	 	hope	for	the	future	is	to	adopt	a	new	conception	of	human	 eco 	 logy 	 	,	one	in	which	we	start	to	 re 	 constitute 	 	our	conception	of	the	 rich 	 ness 	 	of	human	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	.
our	education	system	 ha 	 s 	 	 min 	 ed 	 	our	 mind 	 s 	 	in	the	way	that	we	strip	-	mine	the	earth	:	for	a	 part 	 icular 	 	 commodit 	 y 	 	.
and	for	the	future	,	it	wo	n't	serve	us	.
we	have	to	 re 	 think 	 	the	fundamental	 principle 	 s 	 	on	which	we	're	 educ 	 ating 	 	our	children	.	there	was	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	quote	by	jonas	salk	,	who	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	if	all	the	 insect 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	to	disappear	from	the	earth	,	 with 	 in 	 	50	 year 	 s 	 	all	life	on	earth	would	end	.
if	all	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	 disappear 	 ed 	 	from	the	earth	,	 with 	 in 	 	50	 year 	 s 	 	all	 form 	 s 	 	of	life	would	flourish	.	``
and	he	's	right	.
what	ted	 celebr 	 ates 	 	is	the	gift	of	the	human	 imagin 	 ation 	 	.
we	have	to	be	 care 	 ful 	 	now	that	we	use	 th 	 is 	 	gift	 wise 	 ly 	 	and	that	we	 a 	 vert 	 	some	of	the	 scenario 	 s 	 	that	we	've	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	.	and	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	we	'll	do	it	is	by	 see 	 ing 	 	our	creative	 cap 	 a 	 cities 	 	for	the	 rich 	 ness 	 	they	are	and	 see 	 ing 	 	our	children	for	the	hope	that	they	are	.	and	our	task	is	to	 educ 	 ate 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	whole	 be 	 ing 	 	,	so	they	can	face	 th 	 is 	 	future	.
by	the	way	--	we	may	not	see	 th 	 is 	 	future	,	but	they	will	.	and	our	job	is	to	help	them	make	 some 	 thing 	 	of	it	.	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
