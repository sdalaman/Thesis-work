i	am	a	 reform 	 ed 	 	 market 	 er 	 	,	and	i	now	work	in	 inter 	 national 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
in	october	,	i	 s 	 pent 	 	some	time	in	the	 democrat 	 ic 	 	 re 	 public 	 	of	congo	,	which	is	the	[	second	]	largest	country	in	africa	.
in	fact	,	it	's	 a 	 s 	 	large	 a 	 s 	 	western	europe	,	but	it	 on 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	300	 mile 	 s 	 	of	 pav 	 ed 	 	 road 	 s 	 	.
the	drc	is	a	 danger 	 ous 	 	place	.
in	the	past	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	five	million	people	have	 di 	 ed 	 	due	to	a	war	in	the	east	.
but	war	is	n't	the	 on 	 ly 	 	reason	that	life	is	difficult	in	the	drc	.
there	are	 man 	 y 	 	health	 issue 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
in	fact	,	the	hiv	 pre 	 valence 	 	rate	is	1.3	percent	among	 adult 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	might	not	sound	like	a	large	number	,	but	in	a	country	with	76	million	people	,	it	 mean 	 s 	 	there	are	930,000	that	are	 infect 	 ed 	 	.
and	due	to	the	poor	 infra 	 structure 	 	,	 on 	 ly 	 	25	percent	of	 t 	 hose 	 	are	 receiv 	 ing 	 	the	life	-	saving	 drug 	 s 	 	that	they	need	.
which	is	why	,	in	part	,	donor	 age 	 ncies 	 	provide	 condom 	 s 	 	at	low	or	no	cost	.
and	so	while	i	was	in	the	drc	,	i	 s 	 pent 	 	a	lot	of	time	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	people	about	 condom 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	damien	.
damien	 run 	 s 	 	a	hotel	 out 	 side 	 	of	kinshasa	.
it	's	a	hotel	that	's	 on 	 ly 	 	open	 un 	 til 	 	 mid 	 night 	 	,	so	it	's	not	a	place	that	you	stay	.
but	it	is	a	place	where	 s 	 ex 	 	 work 	 ers 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 client 	 s 	 	come	.
now	damien	 know 	 s 	 	all	about	 condom 	 s 	 	,	but	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	sell	them	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	there	's	just	not	in	demand	.
it	's	not	surprising	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	three	percent	of	people	in	the	drc	use	 condom 	 s 	 	.
joseph	and	christine	,	who	run	a	 pharma 	 cy 	 	where	they	sell	a	number	of	these	 condom 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 aid 	 	 de 	 spite 	 	the	fact	that	donor	 age 	 ncies 	 	provide	them	at	low	or	no	cost	,	and	they	have	 market 	 ing 	 	 campaign 	 s 	 	that	go	 a 	 long 	 	with	them	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 custom 	 ers 	 	do	n't	buy	the	 brand 	 ed 	 	 version 	 s 	 	.
they	like	the	 generic 	 s 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	a	 market 	 er 	 	,	i	found	that	 cur 	 ious 	 	.
and	so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	look	at	what	the	 market 	 ing 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	like	.
and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	there	are	three	main	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	used	by	the	donor	 age 	 ncies 	 	for	these	 condom 	 s 	 	:	fear	,	 fin 	 anc 	 ing 	 	and	fidelity	.
they	name	the	 condom 	 s 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	vive	,	``	to	live	``	or	trust	.
they	package	it	with	the	red	ribbon	that	 re 	 mind 	 s 	 	us	of	hiv	,	put	it	in	boxes	that	 re 	 mind 	 	you	who	paid	for	them	,	show	 picture 	 s 	 	of	your	wife	or	husband	and	tell	you	to	protect	them	or	to	act	 prud 	 ent 	 ly 	 	.
now	these	are	not	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 some 	 one 	 	is	 think 	 ing 	 	about	just	before	they	go	get	a	condom	.
what	is	it	that	you	think	about	just	before	you	get	a	condom	?
 s 	 ex 	 	!
and	the	private	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	that	sell	 condom 	 s 	 	in	these	 place 	 s 	 	,	they	understand	 th 	 is 	 	.
 the 	 ir 	 	 market 	 ing 	 	is	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	different	.
the	name	might	not	be	much	different	,	but	the	 image 	 ry 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	is	.
some	 brand 	 s 	 	are	 aspir 	 ation 	 al 	 	,	and	 certain 	 ly 	 	the	 pack 	 aging 	 	is	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 pro 	 voc 	 ative 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	made	me	think	that	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	the	donor	 age 	 ncies 	 	had	just	 mis 	 s 	 ed 	 	out	on	a	key	 a 	 spect 	 	of	 market 	 ing 	 	:	 understand 	 ing 	 	who	's	the	audience	.
and	for	donor	 age 	 ncies 	 	,	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	the	audience	 tend 	 s 	 	to	be	people	that	are	n't	even	in	the	country	they	're	 work 	 ing 	 	[	in	]	.
it	's	people	back	home	,	people	that	support	 the 	 ir 	 	work	,	people	like	these	.
but	if	what	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	is	stop	the	spread	of	hiv	,	we	need	to	think	about	the	 custom 	 er 	 	,	the	people	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	behavior	 need 	 s 	 	to	change	--	the	 couple 	 s 	 	,	the	young	women	,	the	young	men	--	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 live 	 s 	 	depend	on	it	.
and	so	the	 less 	 on 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	matter	what	you	're	selling	;	you	just	have	to	think	about	who	is	your	 custom 	 er 	 	,	and	what	are	the	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	that	are	going	to	get	them	to	change	 the 	 ir 	 	behavior	.
it	might	just	 s 	 ave 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
thank	you	.
