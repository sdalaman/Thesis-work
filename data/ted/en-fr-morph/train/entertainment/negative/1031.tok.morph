i	grew	up	in	new	york	city	,	between	harlem	and	the	bronx	.	growing	up	 a 	 s 	 	a	boy	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	taught	that	men	had	to	be	tough	,	had	to	be	strong	,	had	to	be	 courage 	 ous 	 	,	 domin 	 ating 	 	--	no	pain	,	no	 emotion 	 s 	 	,	with	the	exception	of	anger	--	and	 definite 	 ly 	 	no	fear	;	that	men	are	in	charge	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	women	are	not	;	that	men	lead	,	and	you	should	just	follow	and	do	what	we	say	;	that	men	are	 super 	 ior 	 	;	women	are	 infer 	 ior 	 	;	that	men	are	strong	;	women	are	weak	;	that	women	are	of	less	value	,	 proper 	 ty 	 	of	men	,	and	 object 	 s 	 	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	sexual	 object 	 s 	 	.
i	've	 lat 	 er 	 	come	to	know	that	to	be	the	 collect 	 ive 	 	 social 	 ization 	 	of	men	,	better	known	 a 	 s 	 	the	``	man	box	.	``
see	 th 	 is 	 	man	box	 ha 	 s 	 	in	it	all	the	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	of	how	we	define	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	to	be	a	man	.
now	i	 al 	 so 	 	want	to	say	,	 with 	 out 	 	a	doubt	,	there	are	some	 wonder 	 ful 	 	,	 wonder 	 ful 	 	,	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	about	 be 	 ing 	 	a	man	.
but	at	the	same	time	,	there	's	some	stuff	that	's	just	straight	up	 twist 	 ed 	 	,
and	we	 re 	 ally 	 	need	to	begin	to	 challeng 	 e 	 	,	look	at	it	and	 re 	 ally 	 	get	in	the	process	of	 de 	 construct 	 ing 	 	,	 re 	 defi 	 ning 	 	,	what	we	come	to	know	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 hood 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	my	two	at	home	,	kendall	and	jay	.
they	're	11	and	12	.
kendall	's	15	 month 	 s 	 	 old 	 er 	 	than	jay	.
there	was	a	period	of	time	when	my	wife	--	her	name	is	tammie	--	and	i	,	we	just	got	real	 bus 	 y 	 	and	whip	,	 b 	 am 	 	,	boom	:	kendall	and	jay	.	and	when	they	 we 	 re 	 	about	five	and	six	,	four	and	five	,	jay	could	come	to	me	,	come	to	me	 cry 	 ing 	 	.
it	did	n't	matter	what	she	was	 cry 	 ing 	 	about	,	she	could	get	on	my	knee	,	she	could	 s 	 not 	 	my	sleeve	up	,	just	cry	,	cry	it	out	.
 d 	 addy 	 	's	got	you	.	that	's	all	that	's	 import 	 ant 	 	.
now	kendall	on	the	other	hand	--	and	like	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	he	's	 on 	 ly 	 	15	 month 	 s 	 	 old 	 er 	 	than	her	--	he	'd	come	to	me	 cry 	 ing 	 	,	it	's	like	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	i	would	hear	him	cry	,	a	clock	would	go	off	.
i	would	give	the	boy	 prob 	 ably 	 	about	30	 second 	 s 	 	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	,	by	the	time	he	got	to	me	,	i	was	 al 	 ready 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	,	``	why	are	you	 cry 	 ing 	 	?
hold	your	head	up	.	look	at	me	.
explain	to	me	what	's	wrong	.
tell	me	what	's	wrong	.	i	ca	n't	understand	you	.
why	are	you	 cry 	 ing 	 	?	``
and	out	of	my	own	 frust 	 ration 	 	of	my	role	and	 respons 	 ibility 	 	of	building	him	up	 a 	 s 	 	a	man	to	fit	 in 	 to 	 	these	 guide 	 lines 	 	and	these	 structure 	 s 	 	that	are	 defi 	 ning 	 	 th 	 is 	 	man	box	,	i	would	find	 my 	 self 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	,	``	just	go	in	your	room	.	just	go	on	,	go	on	in	your	room	.
 s 	 it 	 	down	,	get	 your 	 self 	 	together	and	come	back	and	talk	to	me	when	you	can	talk	to	me	like	a	-	-	``	what	?
like	a	man	.
and	he	's	five	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	grow	in	life	,	i	would	say	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	``	my	god	,	what	's	wrong	with	me	?
what	am	i	 do 	 ing 	 	?	why	would	i	do	 th 	 is 	 	?	``
and	i	think	back	.
i	think	back	to	my	father	.
there	was	a	time	in	my	life	where	we	had	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 trouble 	 d 	 	experience	in	our	family	.
my	brother	,	henry	,	he	 di 	 ed 	 	 tragic 	 ally 	 	when	we	 we 	 re 	 	 teenager 	 s 	 	.
we	lived	in	new	york	city	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	.
we	lived	in	the	bronx	at	the	time	,
and	the	burial	was	in	a	place	 call 	 ed 	 	long	 is 	 land 	 	,	it	was	about	two	 hour 	 s 	 	 out 	 side 	 	of	the	city	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	 pre 	 par 	 ing 	 	to	come	back	from	the	burial	,	the	 car 	 s 	 	 stop 	 ped 	 	at	the	 bath 	 room 	 	to	let	 folk 	 s 	 	take	care	of	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	before	the	long	ride	back	to	the	city	.
and	the	 lim 	 ous 	 ine 	 	 empti 	 es 	 	out	.
my	mother	,	my	sister	,	my	 a 	 untie 	 	,	they	all	get	out	,	but	my	father	and	i	 stay 	 ed 	 	in	the	 lim 	 ous 	 ine 	 	,
and	no	 soon 	 er 	 	than	the	women	got	out	,	he	burst	out	 cry 	 ing 	 	.
he	did	n't	want	cry	in	front	of	me	,
but	he	 k 	 new 	 	he	was	n't	going	to	make	it	back	to	the	city	,	and	it	was	better	me	than	to	allow	 him 	 self 	 	to	express	these	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	 emotion 	 s 	 	in	front	of	the	women	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	man	who	,	10	 minute 	 s 	 	ago	,	in	the	ground	--	 some 	 thing 	 	i	just	ca	n't	even	imagine	.
the	thing	that	 stick 	 s 	 	with	me	the	most	is	that	he	was	 apolog 	 izing 	 	to	me	for	 cry 	 ing 	 	in	front	of	me	,
and	at	the	same	time	,	he	was	 al 	 so 	 	giving	me	 prop 	 s 	 	,	 lift 	 ing 	 	me	up	,	for	not	 cry 	 ing 	 	.
i	come	to	 al 	 so 	 	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	fear	that	we	have	 a 	 s 	 	men	,	 th 	 is 	 	fear	that	just	 ha 	 s 	 	us	 paralyze 	 d 	 	,	 hold 	 ing 	 	us	 host 	 age 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	man	box	.
i	can	remember	 s 	 peaking 	 	to	a	12	-	year	-	old	boy	,	a	 foot 	 ball 	 	player	,	and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	him	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	how	would	you	feel	if	,	in	front	of	all	the	 player 	 s 	 	,	your	coach	told	you	you	 we 	 re 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	like	a	girl	?	``
now	i	 expect 	 ed 	 	him	to	say	 some 	 thing 	 	like	,	i	'd	be	 s 	 ad 	 	;	i	'd	be	mad	;	i	'd	be	 ang 	 ry 	 	,	or	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
no	,	the	boy	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	--	the	boy	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	``	it	would	destroy	me	.	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	``	god	,	if	it	would	destroy	him	to	be	 call 	 ed 	 	a	girl	,	what	are	we	then	 teach 	 ing 	 	him	about	 girl 	 s 	 	?	``
it	took	me	back	to	a	time	when	i	was	about	12	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
i	grew	up	in	 ten 	 ement 	 	 building 	 s 	 	in	the	inner	city	.
at	 th 	 is 	 	time	we	're	living	in	the	bronx	,
and	in	the	building	next	to	where	i	lived	there	was	a	guy	named	johnny	.
he	was	about	16	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	and	we	 we 	 re 	 	all	about	12	 year 	 s 	 	old	--	 young 	 er 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	.
and	he	was	 hang 	 ing 	 	out	with	all	us	 young 	 er 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	guy	,	he	was	up	to	a	lot	of	no	good	.
he	was	the	kind	of	kid	who	 parent 	 s 	 	would	have	to	wonder	,	``	what	is	 th 	 is 	 	16	-	year	-	old	boy	 do 	 ing 	 	with	these	12	-	year	-	old	 boy 	 s 	 	?	``
and	he	did	 s 	 pend 	 	a	lot	of	time	up	to	no	good	.
he	was	a	 trouble 	 d 	 	kid	.
his	mother	had	 di 	 ed 	 	from	a	 hero 	 in 	 	 over 	 dose 	 	.
he	was	 be 	 ing 	 	raised	by	his	 grand 	 mother 	 	.
his	father	was	n't	on	the	set	.
his	 grand 	 mother 	 	had	two	 job 	 s 	 	.
he	was	home	 al 	 one 	 	a	lot	.
but	i	've	got	to	tell	you	,	we	young	 guy 	 s 	 	,	we	 look 	 ed 	 	up	to	 th 	 is 	 	 du 	 de 	 	,	man	.
he	was	cool	.	he	was	fine	.
that	's	what	the	 sister 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	he	was	fine	.	``
he	was	 hav 	 ing 	 	 s 	 ex 	 	.
we	all	 look 	 ed 	 	up	to	him	.
so	one	day	,	i	'm	out	in	front	of	the	house	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	--	just	 play 	 ing 	 	around	,	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	--	i	do	n't	know	what	.
he	 look 	 s 	 	out	his	window	;	he	 call 	 s 	 	me	 up 	 stair 	 s 	 	;	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	anthony	.	``
they	 call 	 ed 	 	me	anthony	growing	up	 a 	 s 	 	a	kid	.
``	 he 	 y 	 	anthony	,	come	on	 up 	 stair 	 s 	 	.	``
johnny	call	,	you	go	.
so	i	run	right	 up 	 stair 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	he	 open 	 s 	 	the	door	,	he	 say 	 s 	 	to	me	,	``	do	you	want	some	?	``
now	i	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	 k 	 new 	 	what	he	 me 	 ant 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	for	me	growing	up	at	that	time	,	and	our	relationship	with	 th 	 is 	 	man	box	,	``	do	you	want	some	?	``	 me 	 ant 	 	one	of	two	 thing 	 s 	 	:	 s 	 ex 	 	or	 drug 	 s 	 	--	and	we	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 do 	 ing 	 	 drug 	 s 	 	.
now	my	box	,	my	card	,	my	man	box	card	,	was	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	in	 jeopard 	 y 	 	.
two	 thing 	 s 	 	:	one	,	i	never	had	 s 	 ex 	 	.
we	do	n't	talk	about	that	 a 	 s 	 	men	.
you	 on 	 ly 	 	tell	your	 dear 	 est 	 	,	 close 	 st 	 	friend	,	 s 	 worn 	 	to	secrecy	for	life	,	the	first	time	you	had	 s 	 ex 	 	.
for	 every 	 body 	 	else	,	we	go	around	like	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	 s 	 ex 	 	since	we	 we 	 re 	 	two	.
there	ai	n't	no	first	time	.
the	other	thing	i	could	n't	tell	him	is	that	i	did	n't	want	any	.
that	's	even	 wo 	 rse 	 	.	we	're	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	 al 	 ways 	 	be	on	the	 pro 	 wl 	 	.
women	are	 object 	 s 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	sexual	 object 	 s 	 	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	so	i	could	n't	tell	him	any	of	that	.
so	,	like	my	mother	would	say	,	make	a	long	story	short	,	i	just	 simpl 	 y 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	to	johnny	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	.	``
he	told	me	to	go	in	his	room	.
i	go	in	his	room	.	on	his	bed	is	a	girl	from	the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	named	sheila	.
she	's	16	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
she	's	 nud 	 e 	 	.
she	's	what	i	know	 to 	 day 	 	to	be	 ment 	 ally 	 	ill	,	 high 	 er 	 	-	 function 	 ing 	 	at	 time 	 s 	 	than	 other 	 s 	 	.
we	had	a	whole	choice	of	 in 	 appropriate 	 	 name 	 s 	 	for	her	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	johnny	had	just	gotten	through	 hav 	 ing 	 	 s 	 ex 	 	with	her	.
well	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	he	 rap 	 ed 	 	her	,	but	he	would	say	he	had	 s 	 ex 	 	with	her	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	while	sheila	never	 s 	 aid 	 	no	,	she	 al 	 so 	 	never	 s 	 aid 	 	 y 	 es 	 	.
so	he	was	 off 	 er 	 ing 	 	me	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	do	the	same	.
so	when	i	go	in	the	room	,	i	close	the	door	.
 folk 	 s 	 	,	i	'm	 petr 	 ified 	 	.
i	stand	with	my	back	to	the	door	so	johnny	ca	n't	bust	in	the	room	and	see	that	i	'm	not	 do 	 ing 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	,
and	i	stand	there	long	 en 	 ough 	 	that	i	could	have	 actual 	 ly 	 	 d 	 one 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	.
so	now	i	'm	no	 long 	 er 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	what	i	'm	going	to	do	;
i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	how	i	'm	going	to	get	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	room	.
so	in	my	12	 year 	 s 	 	of	 wis 	 dom 	 	,	i	zip	my	pants	down	,	i	walk	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	room	,	and	lo	and	 be 	 hold 	 	to	me	,	while	i	was	in	the	room	with	sheila	,	johnny	was	back	at	the	window	 call 	 ing 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	up	.
so	now	there	's	a	living	room	full	of	 guy 	 s 	 	.
it	was	like	the	 wait 	 ing 	 	room	in	the	doctor	's	 off 	 ice 	 	.
and	they	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	how	was	it	,
and	i	say	to	them	,	``	it	was	good	,	``
and	i	zip	my	pants	up	in	front	of	them	,	and	i	head	for	the	door	.
now	i	say	 th 	 is 	 	all	with	remorse	,	and	i	was	 feel 	 ing 	 	a	tremendous	amount	of	remorse	at	that	time	,	but	i	was	 conflict 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	while	i	was	 feel 	 ing 	 	remorse	,	i	was	 excit 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	did	n't	get	caught	.	but	i	 k 	 new 	 	i	felt	bad	about	what	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	fear	,	 get 	 ting 	 	 out 	 side 	 	the	man	box	,	 total 	 ly 	 	 envelop 	 ed 	 	me	.
it	was	way	more	 import 	 ant 	 	to	me	,	about	me	and	my	man	box	card	than	about	sheila	and	what	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	to	her	.
see	 collect 	 ively 	 	,	we	 a 	 s 	 	men	are	taught	to	have	less	value	in	women	,	to	view	them	 a 	 s 	 	 proper 	 ty 	 	and	the	 object 	 s 	 	of	men	.
we	see	that	 a 	 s 	 	an	 equ 	 ation 	 	that	 equal 	 s 	 	violence	against	women	.
we	 a 	 s 	 	men	,	good	men	,	the	large	 major 	 ity 	 	of	men	,	we	 oper 	 ate 	 	on	the	 found 	 ation 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	whole	 collect 	 ive 	 	 social 	 ization 	 	.
we	kind	of	see	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 separat 	 e 	 	,	but	we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	much	a	part	of	it	.
you	see	,	we	have	to	come	to	understand	that	less	value	,	 proper 	 ty 	 	and	 object 	 ification 	 	is	the	 found 	 ation 	 	and	the	violence	ca	n't	happen	 with 	 out 	 	it	.
so	we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	much	a	part	of	the	solution	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	the	problem	.
the	center	for	disease	control	 say 	 s 	 	that	men	's	violence	against	women	is	at	 epi 	 demic 	 	 proportion 	 s 	 	,	is	the	number	one	health	concern	for	women	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	and	 a 	 broad 	 	.
so	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	i	'd	like	to	just	say	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	love	of	my	life	,	my	daughter	jay	.
the	world	i	envision	for	her	--	how	do	i	want	men	to	be	 act 	 ing 	 	and	 behav 	 ing 	 	?
i	need	you	on	board	.	i	need	you	with	me	.
i	need	you	 work 	 ing 	 	with	me	and	me	 work 	 ing 	 	with	you	on	how	we	raise	our	 son 	 s 	 	and	teach	them	to	be	men	--	that	it	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	to	not	be	 domin 	 ating 	 	,	that	it	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	to	have	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	 emotion 	 s 	 	,	that	it	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	to	promote	 e 	 quality 	 	,	that	it	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	to	have	women	who	are	just	 friend 	 s 	 	and	that	's	it	,	that	it	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	to	be	whole	,	that	my	 liber 	 ation 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	man	is	 ti 	 ed 	 	to	your	 liber 	 ation 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	woman	.
i	remember	 ask 	 ing 	 	a	nine	-	year	-	old	boy	,	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	a	nine	-	year	-	old	boy	,	``	what	would	life	be	like	for	you	,	if	you	did	n't	have	to	adhere	to	 th 	 is 	 	man	box	?	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	``	i	would	be	free	.	``
thank	you	 folk 	 s 	 	.
