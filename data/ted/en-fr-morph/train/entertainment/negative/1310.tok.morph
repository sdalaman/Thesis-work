do	you	remember	the	story	of	odysseus	and	the	 siren 	 s 	 	from	high	school	or	 juni 	 or 	 	high	school	?
there	was	 th 	 is 	 	hero	,	odysseus	,	who	's	 head 	 ing 	 	back	home	after	the	trojan	war	.
and	he	's	 stand 	 ing 	 	on	the	deck	of	his	ship	,	he	's	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	his	first	mate	,	and	he	's	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	,	we	will	sail	past	 t 	 hose 	 	 rock 	 s 	 	,	and	on	 t 	 hose 	 	 rock 	 s 	 	 s 	 it 	 	some	 beaut 	 iful 	 	women	 call 	 ed 	 	 siren 	 s 	 	.
and	these	women	 s 	 ing 	 	an	 enchant 	 ing 	 	song	,	a	song	so	 all 	 ur 	 ing 	 	that	all	 sail 	 ors 	 	who	hear	it	crash	 in 	 to 	 	the	 rock 	 s 	 	and	die	.	``	now	you	would	expect	,	 give 	 n 	 	that	,	that	they	would	 choos 	 e 	 	an	alternate	route	around	the	 siren 	 s 	 	,	but	 in 	 stead 	 	odysseus	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	want	to	hear	that	song	.
and	so	what	i	'm	going	to	do	is	i	'm	going	to	pour	wax	in	the	 ear 	 s 	 	of	you	and	all	the	men	--	stay	with	me	--	so	that	you	ca	n't	hear	the	song	,	and	then	i	'm	going	to	have	you	tie	me	to	the	mast	so	that	i	can	listen	and	we	can	all	sail	by	 un 	 affect 	 ed 	 	.	``
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 cap 	 tain 	 	 put 	 ting 	 	the	life	of	every	single	person	on	the	ship	at	risk	so	that	he	can	hear	a	song	.
and	i	'd	like	to	think	if	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	case	,	they	 prob 	 ably 	 	would	have	 rehears 	 ed 	 	it	a	few	 time 	 s 	 	.
odysseus	would	have	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	let	's	do	a	dry	run	.
you	tie	me	to	the	mast	,	and	i	'm	going	to	beg	and	plead	.
and	no	matter	what	i	say	,	you	can	not	untie	me	from	the	mast	.
all	right	,	so	tie	me	to	the	mast	.	``	and	the	first	mate	 take 	 s 	 	a	rope	and	ties	odysseus	to	the	mast	in	a	nice	knot	.
and	odysseus	 do 	 es 	 	his	best	job	 play 	 act 	 ing 	 	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	untie	me	.	untie	me	.
i	want	to	hear	that	song	.	untie	me	.	``	and	the	first	mate	 wise 	 ly 	 	 resist 	 s 	 	and	 do 	 es 	 	n't	untie	odysseus	.
and	then	odysseus	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	see	that	you	can	get	it	.
all	right	,	untie	me	now	and	we	'll	get	some	 d 	 inner 	 	.	``	and	the	first	mate	 hesit 	 ates 	 	.
he	's	like	,	``	is	 th 	 is 	 	still	the	 rehears 	 al 	 	,	or	should	i	untie	him	?	``	and	the	first	mate	 think 	 s 	 	,	``	well	,	i	guess	at	some	point	the	 rehears 	 al 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	end	.	``
so	he	 untie 	 s 	 	odysseus	,	and	odysseus	 flip 	 s 	 	out	.
he	's	like	,	``	you	idiot	.	you	moron	.
if	you	do	that	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	,	i	'll	be	dead	,	you	'll	be	dead	,	every	single	one	of	the	men	will	be	dead	.
now	just	do	n't	untie	me	no	matter	what	.	``
he	 throw 	 s 	 	the	first	mate	to	the	ground	.
 th 	 is 	 	 repeat 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	through	the	night	--	 rehears 	 al 	 	,	 ty 	 ing 	 	to	the	mast	,	 con 	 ning 	 	his	way	out	of	it	,	 beat 	 ing 	 	the	poor	first	mate	up	 merci 	 lessly 	 	.
hilarity	ensues	.
 ty 	 ing 	 	 your 	 self 	 	to	a	mast	is	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	the	 old 	 est 	 	written	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	what	 psycho 	 logists 	 	call	a	 commit 	 ment 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	.
a	 commit 	 ment 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	is	a	decision	that	you	make	with	a	cool	head	to	bind	 your 	 self 	 	so	that	you	do	n't	do	 some 	 thing 	 	 regret 	 table 	 	when	you	have	a	hot	head	.
 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	two	 head 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	one	person	when	you	think	about	it	.
 scholar 	 s 	 	have	long	 invoke 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	metaphor	of	two	 s 	 elves 	 	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	 question 	 s 	 	of	 tempt 	 ation 	 	.
there	is	first	,	the	present	self	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	like	odysseus	when	he	's	 hear 	 ing 	 	the	song	.
he	just	 want 	 s 	 	to	get	to	the	front	row	.
he	just	 think 	 s 	 	about	the	here	and	now	and	the	 im 	 mediate 	 	 grat 	 ification 	 	.
but	then	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	other	self	,	the	future	self	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	odysseus	 a 	 s 	 	an	old	man	who	 want 	 s 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	more	than	to	retire	in	a	 s 	 un 	 ny 	 	villa	with	his	wife	penelope	 out 	 side 	 	of	ithaca	--	the	other	one	.
so	why	do	we	need	 commit 	 ment 	 	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	?
well	 resist 	 ing 	 	 tempt 	 ation 	 	is	hard	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	19th	century	english	economist	nassau	william	senior	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	to	 ab 	 stain 	 	from	the	 enjoy 	 ment 	 	which	is	in	our	power	,	or	to	seek	 di 	 stant 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 im 	 mediate 	 	 result 	 s 	 	,	are	among	the	most	 pain 	 ful 	 	 exert 	 ions 	 	of	the	human	will	.	``	if	you	set	 goal 	 s 	 	for	 your 	 self 	 	and	you	're	like	a	lot	of	other	people	,	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	 real 	 ize 	 	it	's	not	that	your	 goal 	 s 	 	are	 physical 	 ly 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	that	's	 keep 	 ing 	 	you	from	 achiev 	 ing 	 	them	,	it	's	that	you	lack	the	self	-	discipline	to	stick	to	them	.
it	's	 physical 	 ly 	 	possible	to	lose	weight	.
it	's	 physical 	 ly 	 	possible	to	 exercis 	 e 	 	more	.
but	 resist 	 ing 	 	 tempt 	 ation 	 	is	hard	.
the	other	reason	that	it	's	difficult	to	resist	 tempt 	 ation 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	an	 un 	 equal 	 	battle	between	the	present	self	and	the	future	self	.
i	mean	,	let	's	face	it	,	the	present	self	is	present	.
it	's	in	control	.	it	's	in	power	right	now	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	these	strong	,	 hero 	 ic 	 	 arm 	 s 	 	that	can	lift	 dough 	 nuts 	 	 in 	 to 	 	your	mouth	.
and	the	future	self	is	not	even	around	.
it	's	off	in	the	future	.	it	's	weak	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	even	have	a	lawyer	present	.
there	's	 no 	 body 	 	to	stick	up	for	the	future	self	.
and	so	the	present	self	can	 trou 	 nce 	 	all	over	 it 	 s 	 	 dream 	 s 	 	.
so	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	battle	between	the	two	 s 	 elves 	 	that	's	 be 	 ing 	 	 f 	 ought 	 	,	and	we	need	 commit 	 ment 	 	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	to	level	the	 play 	 ing 	 	field	between	the	two	.
now	i	'm	a	big	fan	of	 commit 	 ment 	 	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
 ty 	 ing 	 	 your 	 self 	 	to	the	mast	is	the	 old 	 est 	 	one	,	but	there	are	other	 one 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 lock 	 ing 	 	a	credit	card	away	with	a	key	or	not	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	junk	food	 in 	 to 	 	the	house	so	you	wo	n't	eat	it	or	 un 	 plug 	 ging 	 	your	 inter 	 net 	 	 connect 	 ion 	 	so	you	can	use	your	computer	.
i	was	creating	 commit 	 ment 	 	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	of	my	own	long	before	i	 k 	 new 	 	what	they	 we 	 re 	 	.
so	when	i	was	a	 starv 	 ing 	 	post	-	doc	at	columbia	university	,	i	was	deep	in	a	publish	-	or	-	perish	phase	of	my	 care 	 er 	 	.
i	had	to	write	five	 page 	 s 	 	a	day	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 paper 	 s 	 	or	i	would	have	to	give	up	five	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
and	when	you	try	to	execute	these	 commit 	 ment 	 	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	,	you	 real 	 ize 	 	the	devil	is	 re 	 ally 	 	in	the	 detail 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	not	that	easy	to	get	rid	of	five	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
i	mean	,	you	ca	n't	burn	it	;	that	's	 il 	 legal 	 	.
and	i	thought	,	well	i	could	give	it	to	a	 char 	 ity 	 	or	give	it	to	my	wife	or	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
but	then	i	thought	,	oh	,	i	'm	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	 my 	 self 	 	 mix 	 ed 	 	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	not	writing	is	bad	,	but	giving	to	 char 	 ity 	 	is	good	.
so	then	i	would	kind	of	 just 	 ify 	 	not	writing	by	giving	a	gift	.
and	then	i	kind	of	 flip 	 ped 	 	that	around	and	thought	,	well	i	could	give	it	to	the	neo	-	nazis	.
but	then	i	was	like	,	that	's	more	bad	than	writing	is	good	,	and	so	that	would	n't	work	.
so	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	i	just	 decide 	 d 	 	i	would	 leav 	 e 	 	it	in	an	 envelop 	 e 	 	on	the	 sub 	 way 	 	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	a	good	person	would	find	it	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	a	bad	person	would	find	it	.
on	average	,	it	was	just	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	 point 	 less 	 	 ex 	 change 	 	of	money	that	i	would	regret	.
 s 	 uch 	 	it	is	with	 commit 	 ment 	 	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	.
but	 de 	 spite 	 	my	like	for	them	,	there	's	two	 nag 	 ging 	 	 concern 	 s 	 	that	i	've	 al 	 ways 	 	had	about	 commit 	 ment 	 	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	,	and	you	might	feel	 th 	 is 	 	if	you	use	them	 your 	 self 	 	.
so	the	first	is	,	when	you	've	got	one	of	these	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	going	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	contract	to	write	 every 	 day 	 	or	pay	,	it	's	just	a	constant	 re 	 mind 	 er 	 	that	you	have	no	self	-	control	.
you	're	just	 tell 	 ing 	 	 your 	 self 	 	,	``	 with 	 out 	 	you	,	 commit 	 ment 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	,	i	am	 noth 	 ing 	 	,	i	have	no	self	-	discipline	.	``	and	then	when	you	're	ever	in	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	where	you	do	n't	have	a	 commit 	 ment 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	in	place	--	like	,	``	oh	my	god	,	that	person	's	 off 	 er 	 ing 	 	me	a	 dough 	 nut 	 	,	and	i	have	no	defense	 mechan 	 ism 	 	,	``	--	you	just	eat	it	.
so	i	do	n't	like	the	way	that	they	take	the	power	away	from	you	.
i	think	self	-	discipline	is	 some 	 thing 	 	,	it	's	like	a	muscle	.
the	more	you	 exercis 	 e 	 	it	,	the	 strong 	 er 	 	it	 get 	 s 	 	.
the	other	problem	with	 commit 	 ment 	 	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	is	that	you	can	 al 	 ways 	 	weasel	your	way	out	of	them	.
you	say	,	``	well	,	of	course	i	ca	n't	write	 to 	 day 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	giving	a	tedtalk	and	i	have	five	media	 interview 	 s 	 	,	and	then	i	'm	going	to	a	 cock 	 tail 	 	party	and	then	i	'll	be	drunk	after	that	.
and	so	there	's	no	way	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	work	.	``	so	in	effect	,	you	are	like	odysseus	and	the	first	mate	in	one	person	.
you	're	 put 	 ting 	 	 your 	 self 	 	,	you	're	 bind 	 ing 	 	 your 	 self 	 	,	and	you	're	 weasel 	 ing 	 	your	way	out	of	it	,	and	then	you	're	 beat 	 ing 	 	 your 	 self 	 	up	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	.
so	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	for	about	a	decade	now	on	 find 	 ing 	 	other	ways	to	change	people	's	relationship	to	the	future	self	 with 	 out 	 	using	 commit 	 ment 	 	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	.
in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	i	'm	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	relationship	to	the	future	financial	self	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 time 	 ly 	 	issue	.
i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	 top 	 ic 	 	of	saving	.
now	saving	is	a	classic	two	 s 	 elves 	 	problem	.
the	present	self	 do 	 es 	 	not	want	to	 s 	 ave 	 	at	all	.
it	 want 	 s 	 	to	 consum 	 e 	 	.
 where 	 a 	 s 	 	the	future	self	 want 	 s 	 	the	present	self	to	 s 	 ave 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 time 	 ly 	 	problem	.
we	look	at	the	 saving 	 s 	 	rate	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 dec 	 lining 	 	since	the	1950s	.
at	the	same	time	,	the	 retire 	 ment 	 	risk	index	,	the	chance	of	not	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	meet	your	 need 	 s 	 	in	 retire 	 ment 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	increasing	.
and	we	're	at	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	now	where	for	every	three	baby	 boom 	 ers 	 	,	the	mckinsey	global	institute	 predict 	 s 	 	that	two	will	not	be	able	to	meet	 the 	 ir 	 	pre	-	 retire 	 ment 	 	 need 	 s 	 	while	they	're	in	 retire 	 ment 	 	.
so	what	can	we	do	about	 th 	 is 	 	?
there	's	a	 philosoph 	 er 	 	,	derek	parfit	,	who	 s 	 aid 	 	some	 word 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	inspiring	to	my	 co 	 author 	 s 	 	and	i	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	that	,	``	we	might	neglect	our	future	 s 	 elves 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	some	failure	of	belief	or	 imagin 	 ation 	 	.	``
that	is	to	say	,	we	 some 	 how 	 	might	not	 believ 	 e 	 	that	we	're	going	to	get	old	,	or	we	might	not	be	able	to	imagine	that	we	're	going	to	get	old	some	day	.
on	the	one	hand	,	it	 sound 	 s 	 	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	.
of	course	,	we	know	that	we	're	going	to	get	old	.
but	are	n't	there	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	 believ 	 e 	 	and	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	at	the	same	time	?
so	my	 co 	 author 	 s 	 	and	i	have	used	 computer 	 s 	 	,	the	 great 	 est 	 	tool	of	our	time	,	to	assist	people	's	 imagin 	 ation 	 	and	help	them	imagine	what	it	might	be	like	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	future	.
and	i	'll	show	you	some	of	these	 tool 	 s 	 	right	here	.
the	first	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 distribut 	 ion 	 	 build 	 er 	 	.
it	 show 	 s 	 	people	what	the	future	might	be	like	by	 show 	 ing 	 	them	a	hundred	 equal 	 ly 	 	 prob 	 able 	 	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	that	might	be	 obtain 	 ed 	 	in	the	future	.
each	 out 	 come 	 	is	 show 	 n 	 	by	one	of	these	 marker 	 s 	 	,	and	each	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	on	a	row	that	 represent 	 s 	 	a	level	of	wealth	and	 retire 	 ment 	 	.
 be 	 ing 	 	up	at	the	top	 mean 	 s 	 	that	you	're	 enjoy 	 ing 	 	a	high	income	in	 retire 	 ment 	 	.
 be 	 ing 	 	down	at	the	bottom	 mean 	 s 	 	that	you	're	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	to	make	 end 	 s 	 	meet	.
when	you	make	an	 invest 	 ment 	 	,	what	you	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	is	,	``	i	accept	that	any	one	of	these	100	 thing 	 s 	 	could	happen	to	me	and	determine	my	wealth	.	``	now	you	can	try	to	move	your	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	around	.
you	can	try	to	 manipul 	 ate 	 	your	fate	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	person	is	 do 	 ing 	 	,	but	it	 cost 	 s 	 	you	 some 	 thing 	 	to	do	it	.
it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	you	have	to	 s 	 ave 	 	more	 to 	 day 	 	.
once	you	find	an	 invest 	 ment 	 	that	you	're	happy	with	,	what	people	do	is	they	click	``	 d 	 one 	 	``	and	the	 marker 	 s 	 	begin	to	disappear	,	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	,	one	by	one	.
it	 simul 	 ates 	 	what	it	is	like	to	invest	in	 some 	 thing 	 	and	to	watch	that	 invest 	 ment 	 	pan	out	.
at	the	end	,	there	will	 on 	 ly 	 	be	one	marker	left	 stand 	 ing 	 	and	it	will	determine	our	wealth	in	 retire 	 ment 	 	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	person	 retire 	 d 	 	at	150	percent	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	income	in	 retire 	 ment 	 	.
they	're	making	more	money	while	 retire 	 d 	 	than	they	 we 	 re 	 	making	while	they	 we 	 re 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	.
if	you	're	like	most	people	,	just	 see 	 ing 	 	that	 g 	 ave 	 	you	a	small	sense	of	 el 	 ation 	 	and	joy	--	just	to	think	about	making	50	percent	more	money	in	 retire 	 ment 	 	than	before	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	had	you	 end 	 ed 	 	up	on	the	 ver 	 y 	 	bottom	,	it	might	have	 give 	 n 	 	you	a	 s 	 light 	 	sense	of	dread	and	/	or	 nause 	 a 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	to	get	by	in	 retire 	 ment 	 	.
by	using	 th 	 is 	 	tool	over	and	over	and	 simul 	 ating 	 	 out 	 come 	 	after	 out 	 come 	 	,	people	can	understand	that	the	 invest 	 ments 	 	and	 saving 	 s 	 	that	they	 under 	 take 	 	 to 	 day 	 	determine	 the 	 ir 	 	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	in	the	future	.
now	people	are	 motiv 	 ated 	 	through	 emotion 	 s 	 	,	but	different	people	find	different	 thing 	 s 	 	 motiv 	 ating 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 simul 	 ation 	 	that	uses	 graphic 	 s 	 	,	but	other	people	find	 motiv 	 ating 	 	what	money	can	buy	,	not	just	 number 	 s 	 	.
so	here	i	made	a	 distribut 	 ion 	 	 build 	 er 	 	where	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 show 	 ing 	 	 numeric 	 al 	 	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	,	i	show	people	what	 t 	 hose 	 	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	will	get	you	,	in	 part 	 icular 	 	 a 	 part 	 ments 	 	that	you	can	afford	if	you	're	 ret 	 ir 	 ing 	 	on	3,000	,	2,500	,	2,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	per	month	and	so	on	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	move	down	the	 lad 	 der 	 	of	 a 	 part 	 ments 	 	,	you	see	that	they	get	 wo 	 rse 	 	and	 wo 	 rse 	 	.
some	of	them	look	like	 place 	 s 	 	i	lived	in	 a 	 s 	 	a	graduate	student	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	get	to	the	 ver 	 y 	 	bottom	,	you	're	 face 	 d 	 	with	the	 un 	 fortunate 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	that	if	you	do	n't	 s 	 ave 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	for	 retire 	 ment 	 	,	you	wo	n't	be	able	to	afford	any	housing	at	all	.
 t 	 hose 	 	are	actual	 picture 	 s 	 	of	actual	 a 	 part 	 ments 	 	 rent 	 ing 	 	for	that	amount	 a 	 s 	 	 advertise 	 d 	 	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
the	last	thing	i	'll	show	you	,	the	last	 behavior 	 al 	 	time	machine	,	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	 create 	 d 	 	with	hal	hershfield	,	who	was	 introduc 	 ed 	 	to	me	by	my	 co 	 author 	 	on	a	previous	project	,	bill	sharpe	.
and	what	it	is	is	an	exploration	 in 	 to 	 	virtual	 re 	 ality 	 	.
so	what	we	do	is	we	take	 picture 	 s 	 	of	people	--	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	college	-	age	people	--	and	we	use	 soft 	 ware 	 	to	age	them	and	show	these	people	what	they	'll	look	like	when	they	're	60	,	70	,	80	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
and	we	try	to	test	 whet 	 her 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 assist 	 ing 	 	your	 imagin 	 ation 	 	by	looking	at	the	face	of	your	future	self	can	change	you	 invest 	 ment 	 	behavior	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	our	 experiment 	 s 	 	.
here	we	see	the	face	of	the	young	subject	on	the	left	.
he	's	 give 	 n 	 	a	control	that	 allow 	 s 	 	him	to	adjust	his	 saving 	 s 	 	rate	.
 a 	 s 	 	he	 move 	 s 	 	his	 saving 	 s 	 	rate	down	,	it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	he	's	saving	zero	when	it	's	all	the	way	here	at	the	left	.
you	can	see	his	current	annual	income	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 percent 	 age 	 	of	his	 pay 	 check 	 	that	he	can	take	home	 to 	 day 	 	--	is	 quit 	 e 	 	high	,	91	percent	,	but	his	 retire 	 ment 	 	income	is	 quit 	 e 	 	low	.
he	's	going	to	retire	on	44	percent	of	what	he	 earn 	 ed 	 	while	he	was	 work 	 ing 	 	.
if	he	 s 	 ave 	 s 	 	the	 maxim 	 um 	 	legal	amount	,	his	 retire 	 ment 	 	income	 go 	 es 	 	up	,	but	he	's	 un 	 happy 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	now	he	 ha 	 s 	 	less	money	on	the	left	-	hand	side	to	 s 	 pend 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
other	 condition 	 s 	 	show	people	the	future	self	.
and	from	the	future	self	's	point	of	view	,	 every 	 thing 	 	is	in	reverse	.
if	you	 s 	 ave 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	little	,	the	future	self	is	 un 	 happy 	 	living	on	44	percent	of	the	income	.
 where 	 a 	 s 	 	if	the	present	self	 s 	 ave 	 s 	 	a	lot	,	the	future	self	is	 de 	 light 	 ed 	 	,	where	the	income	is	close	up	near	100	percent	.
to	 br 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	to	a	 wide 	 r 	 	audience	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	with	hal	and	allianz	to	create	 some 	 thing 	 	we	call	the	 behavior 	 al 	 	time	machine	,	in	which	you	not	 on 	 ly 	 	get	to	see	 your 	 self 	 	in	the	future	,	but	you	get	to	see	 anticip 	 ated 	 	 emotion 	 al 	 	 react 	 ions 	 	to	different	 level 	 s 	 	of	 retire 	 ment 	 	wealth	.
so	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	here	is	 some 	 body 	 	using	the	tool	.
and	just	watch	the	 fa 	 cial 	 	 express 	 ions 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	move	the	 s 	 lider 	 	.
the	 young 	 er 	 	face	 get 	 s 	 	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	and	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	,	saving	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
the	 old 	 er 	 	face	is	 mis 	 er 	 able 	 	.
and	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	,	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	we	're	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	it	up	to	a	moderate	 saving 	 s 	 	rate	.
and	then	it	's	a	high	 saving 	 s 	 	rate	.
the	 young 	 er 	 	face	is	 get 	 ting 	 	 un 	 happy 	 	.
the	 old 	 er 	 	face	is	 quit 	 e 	 	 pleas 	 ed 	 	with	the	decision	.
we	're	going	to	see	if	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	an	effect	on	what	people	do	.
and	what	's	nice	about	it	is	it	's	not	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 bias 	 ing 	 	people	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 a 	 s 	 	one	face	 s 	 mile 	 s 	 	,	the	other	face	 frown 	 s 	 	.
it	's	not	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	which	way	to	put	the	 s 	 lider 	 	,	it	's	just	 re 	 mind 	 ing 	 	you	that	you	are	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	and	 legal 	 ly 	 	 ti 	 ed 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	future	self	.
your	 decision 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	are	going	to	determine	 it 	 s 	 	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	.
and	that	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	easy	to	forget	.
 th 	 is 	 	use	of	virtual	 re 	 ality 	 	is	not	just	good	for	making	people	look	 old 	 er 	 	.
there	are	 program 	 s 	 	you	can	get	to	see	how	people	might	look	if	they	smoke	,	if	they	get	too	much	 expo 	 s 	 ure 	 	to	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	if	they	gain	weight	and	so	on	.
and	what	's	good	is	,	 un 	 like 	 	in	the	 experiment 	 s 	 	that	hal	and	 my 	 self 	 	ran	with	russ	smith	,	you	do	n't	have	to	program	these	by	 your 	 self 	 	in	order	to	see	the	virtual	 re 	 ality 	 	.
there	are	 application 	 s 	 	you	can	get	on	 smart 	 phone 	 s 	 	for	just	a	few	 dollar 	 s 	 	that	do	the	same	thing	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	picture	of	hal	,	my	 co 	 author 	 	.
you	might	 recogn 	 ize 	 	him	from	the	previous	 demo 	 s 	 	.
and	just	for	 kick 	 s 	 	we	ran	his	picture	through	the	 bald 	 ing 	 	,	aging	and	weight	gain	 soft 	 ware 	 	to	see	how	he	would	look	.
hal	is	here	,	so	i	think	we	owe	it	to	him	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 your 	 self 	 	to	 dis 	 abuse 	 	you	of	that	last	image	.
and	i	'll	close	it	there	.
on	 be 	 half 	 	of	hal	and	 my 	 self 	 	,	i	wish	all	the	best	to	your	present	and	future	 s 	 elves 	 	.
thank	you	.
