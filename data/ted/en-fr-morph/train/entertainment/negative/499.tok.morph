when	most	people	think	about	the	 begin 	 ning 	 s 	 	of	 aid 	 s 	 	,	they	're	gon	na	think	back	to	the	1980s	.
and	 certain 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	decade	in	which	we	 discover 	 ed 	 	 aid 	 s 	 	and	the	virus	that	 cause 	 s 	 	it	,	hiv	.
but	in	fact	 th 	 is 	 	virus	 cross 	 ed 	 	over	 in 	 to 	 	 human 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 decade 	 s 	 	before	,	from	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	,	where	the	virus	 origin 	 ated 	 	,	 in 	 to 	 	 human 	 s 	 	who	hunt	these	 ape 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	photo	was	taken	before	the	great	 depress 	 ion 	 	in	brazzaville	,	congo	.
at	 th 	 is 	 	time	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 individual 	 s 	 	,	we	think	,	that	 we 	 re 	 	 infect 	 ed 	 	with	hiv	.
so	i	have	a	couple	of	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 question 	 s 	 	for	you	.
if	 th 	 is 	 	virus	was	in	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 individual 	 s 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	why	was	it	the	case	that	it	took	us	 un 	 til 	 	1984	to	be	able	to	discover	 th 	 is 	 	virus	?
ok	now	,	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	had	we	 be 	 en 	 	there	in	the	'40s	and	'50s	,	'60s	,	had	we	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	disease	,	had	we	 under 	 stood 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	was	going	on	with	it	,	how	might	that	have	 change 	 d 	 	and	 complete 	 ly 	 	 transform 	 ed 	 	the	nature	of	the	way	 th 	 is 	 	 pan 	 demic 	 	 move 	 d 	 	?
in	fact	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 un 	 ique 	 	to	hiv	.	the	vast	 major 	 ity 	 	of	viruses	come	from	 animal 	 s 	 	.
and	you	can	kind	of	think	of	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	pyramid	of	 th 	 is 	 	 bubb 	 ling 	 	up	of	viruses	from	 animal 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	human	 population 	 s 	 	.
but	 on 	 ly 	 	at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	top	of	 th 	 is 	 	pyramid	do	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	human	.
 never 	 the 	 less 	 	,	we	 s 	 pend 	 	the	vast	 major 	 ity 	 	of	our	energy	focused	on	 th 	 is 	 	level	of	the	pyramid	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	tackle	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 al 	 ready 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	 adapt 	 ed 	 	to	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	that	are	going	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	to	address	--	 a 	 s 	 	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	in	the	case	of	hiv	.
so	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	last	15	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	the	 ear 	 lier 	 	 inter 	 face 	 	here	--	what	i	've	 label 	 ed 	 	``	viral	 chat 	 ter 	 	,	``	which	was	a	term	 co 	 in 	 ed 	 	by	my	mentor	don	burke	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	idea	that	we	can	 stud 	 y 	 	the	sort	of	 ping 	 ing 	 	of	these	viruses	 in 	 to 	 	human	 population 	 s 	 	,	the	 move 	 ment 	 	of	these	 agent 	 s 	 	over	 in 	 to 	 	 human 	 s 	 	;	and	by	 cap 	 tur 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	moment	,	we	might	be	able	to	move	to	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	where	we	can	catch	them	early	.
ok	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	,	and	i	'm	going	to	show	you	some	 picture 	 s 	 	now	from	the	field	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	of	a	central	african	hunter	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 fair 	 ly 	 	common	picture	.
one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	i	want	you	to	note	from	it	is	blood	--	that	you	see	a	tremendous	amount	of	blood	contact	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	 absolute 	 ly 	 	key	for	us	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 intima 	 te 	 	form	of	 connect 	 ion 	 	.
so	if	we	're	going	to	 stud 	 y 	 	viral	 chat 	 ter 	 	,	we	need	to	get	to	these	 population 	 s 	 	who	have	intensive	contact	with	wild	 animal 	 s 	 	.
and	so	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	people	like	 th 	 is 	 	individual	.
we	collect	blood	from	them	,	other	 specimen 	 s 	 	.
we	look	at	the	 disease 	 s 	 	,	which	are	in	the	 animal 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	the	 human 	 s 	 	.
and	 ideal 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	allow	us	to	catch	these	 thing 	 s 	 	early	on	,	 a 	 s 	 	they	're	moving	over	 in 	 to 	 	human	 population 	 s 	 	.
and	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	 object 	 ive 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	work	is	not	to	just	go	out	once	and	look	at	these	 individual 	 s 	 	,	but	to	establish	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 individual 	 s 	 	in	these	 population 	 s 	 	that	we	would	monitor	 continu 	 ously 	 	on	a	regular	 bas 	 is 	 	.
when	they	 we 	 re 	 	sick	,	we	would	collect	 specimen 	 s 	 	from	them	.
we	would	 actual 	 ly 	 	enlist	them	--	which	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	now	--	to	collect	 specimen 	 s 	 	from	 animal 	 s 	 	.
we	give	them	these	little	 piece 	 s 	 	of	filter	paper	.
when	they	 s 	 ample 	 	from	 animal 	 s 	 	,	they	collect	the	blood	on	the	filter	paper	and	 th 	 is 	 	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	identify	yet	-	 un 	 known 	 	viruses	from	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	right	 animal 	 s 	 	--	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 hunt 	 ed 	 	.
 nar 	 rator 	 	:	deep	in	a	remote	region	of	cameroon	,	two	 hunter 	 s 	 	 s 	 talk 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 pre 	 y 	 	.
 the 	 ir 	 	 name 	 s 	 	are	patrice	and	patee	.
they	're	 search 	 ing 	 	for	bush	meat	;	forest	 animal 	 s 	 	they	can	kill	to	feed	 the 	 ir 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	.
patrice	and	patee	set	out	most	 day 	 s 	 	to	go	out	 hunt 	 ing 	 	in	the	forest	around	 the 	 ir 	 	 home 	 s 	 	.
they	have	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 trap 	 s 	 	,	of	 snare 	 s 	 	that	they	've	set	up	to	catch	wild	 pig 	 s 	 	,	 snake 	 s 	 	,	 monkey 	 s 	 	,	 rod 	 ent 	 s 	 	--	 any 	 thing 	 	they	can	,	 re 	 ally 	 	.
patrice	and	patee	have	 be 	 en 	 	out	for	 hour 	 s 	 	but	found	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
the	 animal 	 s 	 	are	 simpl 	 y 	 	gone	.
we	stop	for	a	drink	of	water	.
then	there	is	a	 rust 	 le 	 	in	the	brush	.
a	group	of	 hunter 	 s 	 	approach	,
 the 	 ir 	 	 pack 	 s 	 	 load 	 ed 	 	with	wild	game	.
there	's	at	 l 	 east 	 	three	viruses	that	you	know	about	,	which	are	in	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	monkey	.
nathan	wolfe	:	 th 	 is 	 	species	,	 yea 	 h 	 	.	and	there	's	 man 	 y 	 	 man 	 y 	 	more	 pathogen 	 s 	 	that	are	present	in	these	 animal 	 s 	 	.
these	 individual 	 s 	 	are	at	specific	risk	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	if	there	's	blood	contact	,	they	're	at	risk	for	 trans 	 mission 	 	and	possibly	 infect 	 ion 	 	with	novel	viruses	.
 nar 	 rator 	 	:	 a 	 s 	 	the	 hunter 	 s 	 	 dis 	 play 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 kill 	 s 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	surprising	 happen 	 s 	 	.
they	show	us	filter	paper	they	've	used	to	collect	the	 animal 	 s 	 	'	blood	.
the	blood	will	be	tested	for	zoonotic	viruses	,	part	of	a	program	dr.	wolfe	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 pent 	 	 year 	 s 	 	setting	up	.
nw	:	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	from	 th 	 is 	 	animal	right	here	,	 great 	 er 	 	spot	-	nosed	guenon	.
every	person	who	 ha 	 s 	 	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	filter	 paper 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	at	 l 	 east 	 	,	at	a	 minim 	 um 	 	,	 be 	 en 	 	through	our	 bas 	 ic 	 	health	education	about	the	 risk 	 s 	 	 associate 	 d 	 	with	these	 activ 	 ities 	 	,	which	 pre 	 sum 	 ably 	 	,	from	our	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	 give 	 s 	 	them	the	ability	to	 de 	 crease 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	risk	,	and	then	 obvious 	 ly 	 	the	risk	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	,	the	village	,	the	country	,	and	the	world	.
nw	:	ok	,	before	i	 continu 	 e 	 	,	i	think	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	take	just	a	moment	to	talk	about	bush	meat	.	bush	meat	is	the	 hunt 	 ing 	 	of	wild	game	.
ok	?	and	you	can	consider	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	different	bush	meat	.
i	'm	going	to	be	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
when	your	children	and	 grand 	 children 	 	sort	of	pose	 question 	 s 	 	to	you	about	 th 	 is 	 	period	of	time	,	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	they	're	gon	na	ask	you	,	is	how	it	was	they	we	 allow 	 ed 	 	some	of	our	 close 	 st 	 	living	 relat 	 ive 	 s 	 	,	some	of	the	most	 valu 	 able 	 	and	 en 	 danger 	 ed 	 	species	on	our	planet	,	to	go	extinct	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	n't	able	to	address	some	of	the	 issue 	 s 	 	of	poverty	in	these	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	world	.
but	in	fact	that	's	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	question	they	're	going	to	ask	you	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
they	're	 al 	 so 	 	going	to	ask	you	the	question	that	when	we	 k 	 new 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	way	that	hiv	 enter 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	human	population	,	and	that	other	 disease 	 s 	 	had	the	potential	to	enter	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	why	did	we	let	these	 behavior 	 s 	 	 continu 	 e 	 	?
why	did	we	not	find	some	other	solution	to	 th 	 is 	 	?
they	're	going	to	say	,	in	 region 	 s 	 	of	 pro 	 found 	 	 in 	 st 	 ability 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	world	,	where	you	have	 intens 	 e 	 	poverty	,	where	 population 	 s 	 	are	growing	and	you	do	n't	have	 sustain 	 able 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	lead	to	food	 in 	 security 	 	.
but	they	're	 al 	 so 	 	going	to	ask	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	a	different	question	.
it	's	one	that	i	think	we	all	need	to	ask	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	which	is	,	why	we	thought	the	 respons 	 ibility 	 	 rest 	 ed 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	individual	here	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	individual	--	you	can	see	just	right	up	over	his	right	shoulder	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	individual	that	 hunt 	 ed 	 	the	monkey	from	the	last	picture	that	i	 show 	 ed 	 	you	.
ok	,	take	a	look	at	his	shirt	.
you	know	,	take	a	look	at	his	face	.
bush	meat	is	one	of	the	central	 cri 	 s 	 es 	 	,	which	is	 occur 	 ring 	 	in	our	population	right	now	,	in	 human 	 ity 	 	,	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	.
but	it	ca	n't	be	the	fault	of	 some 	 body 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
ok	?	and	solving	it	can	not	be	his	 respons 	 ibility 	 	 al 	 one 	 	.
there	's	no	easy	 solution 	 s 	 	,	but	what	i	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	to	you	is	that	we	neglect	 th 	 is 	 	problem	at	our	own	peril	.
so	,	in	1998	,	 a 	 long 	 	with	my	 mentor 	 s 	 	don	burke	and	colonel	mpoudi	-	ngole	,	we	went	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	start	 th 	 is 	 	work	in	central	africa	,	to	work	with	 hunter 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	part	of	the	world	.
and	my	job	--	at	that	time	i	was	a	post	-	 doctor 	 al 	 	fellow	,	and	i	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 task 	 ed 	 	with	setting	 th 	 is 	 	up	.
so	i	 s 	 aid 	 	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	``	ok	,	great	--	we	're	gon	na	collect	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 specimen 	 s 	 	.	we	're	gon	na	go	to	all	these	different	 location 	 s 	 	.	it	's	going	to	be	 wonder 	 ful 	 	.	``
you	know	,	i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	map	;	i	 pick 	 ed 	 	out	17	 s 	 ites 	 	;	i	 figur 	 ed 	 	,	no	problem	.
 needle 	 s 	 s 	 	to	say	,	i	was	 drastic 	 ally 	 	wrong	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 challeng 	 ing 	 	work	to	do	.
 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	i	had	and	 continu 	 e 	 	to	have	an	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	team	of	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	and	 collabor 	 ators 	 	in	my	own	team	,	and	that	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	that	 th 	 is 	 	work	can	 re 	 ally 	 	occur	.
we	have	a	whole	range	of	 challeng 	 es 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	work	.
one	of	them	is	just	 obtain 	 ing 	 	trust	from	 individual 	 s 	 	that	we	work	with	in	the	field	.
the	person	you	see	on	the	right	hand	side	is	paul	delong	-	minutu	.
he	's	one	of	the	best	 communicator 	 s 	 	that	i	've	 re 	 ally 	 	ever	 deal 	 t 	 	with	.
when	i	 arriv 	 ed 	 	i	did	n't	speak	a	word	of	french	,	and	i	still	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	understand	what	it	was	he	was	 say 	 ing 	 	.
paul	 work 	 ed 	 	for	 year 	 s 	 	on	the	cameroonian	national	radio	and	 tele 	 vision 	 	,	and	he	spoke	about	health	 issue 	 s 	 	.	he	was	a	health	 correspond 	 ent 	 	.
so	we	 figur 	 ed 	 	we	'd	hire	 th 	 is 	 	person	--	when	we	got	there	he	could	be	a	great	communicator	.
when	we	would	get	to	these	 r 	 ural 	 	 village 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	what	we	found	out	is	that	no	one	had	 tele 	 vision 	 	,	so	they	would	n't	 recogn 	 ize 	 	his	face	.
but	--	when	he	 beg 	 an 	 	to	speak	they	would	 actual 	 ly 	 	 recogn 	 ize 	 	his	voice	from	the	radio	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	 some 	 body 	 	who	had	 in 	 credible 	 	potential	to	spread	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	of	our	 mess 	 age 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	be	with	 regard 	 s 	 	to	 wild 	 life 	 	 conserv 	 ation 	 	or	health	 prevent 	 ion 	 	.
often	we	run	 in 	 to 	 	 obstacle 	 s 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	us	coming	back	from	one	of	these	 ver 	 y 	 	 r 	 ural 	 	 s 	 ites 	 	,	with	 specimen 	 s 	 	from	200	 individual 	 s 	 	that	we	 need 	 ed 	 	to	get	back	to	the	lab	 with 	 in 	 	48	 hour 	 s 	 	.
i	like	to	show	 th 	 is 	 	shot	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	ubald	tamoufe	,	who	's	the	lead	 invest 	 igator 	 	in	our	cameroon	 s 	 ite 	 	.
ubald	 laugh 	 s 	 	at	me	when	i	show	 th 	 is 	 	photo	 be 	 cause 	 	of	course	you	ca	n't	see	his	face	.
but	the	reason	i	like	to	show	the	shot	is	 be 	 cause 	 	you	can	see	that	he	's	about	to	solve	 th 	 is 	 	problem	.
which	--	which	he	did	,	which	he	did	.
just	a	few	quick	before	and	after	 shot 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	our	 labor 	 atory 	 	before	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	now	.
early	on	,	in	order	to	ship	our	 specimen 	 s 	 	,	we	had	to	have	dry	ice	.	to	get	dry	ice	we	had	to	go	to	the	 brew 	 eries 	 	--	beg	,	borrow	,	steal	to	get	these	 folk 	 s 	 	to	give	it	to	us	.
now	we	have	our	own	liquid	nitrogen	.
i	like	to	call	our	 labor 	 atory 	 	the	 cold 	 est 	 	place	in	central	africa	--	it	might	be	.
and	here	's	a	shot	of	me	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	before	shot	of	me	.
no	comment	.
so	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	?	so	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	10	 year 	 s 	 	that	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	work	,	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 surprise 	 d 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
we	made	a	number	of	 discover 	 ies 	 	.
and	what	we	've	found	is	that	if	you	look	in	the	right	place	,	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	monitor	the	flow	of	these	viruses	 in 	 to 	 	human	 population 	 s 	 	.
that	 g 	 ave 	 	us	a	tremendous	amount	of	hope	.
what	we	've	found	is	a	whole	range	of	new	viruses	in	these	 individual 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	new	viruses	in	the	same	group	 a 	 s 	 	hiv	--	so	,	brand	new	 retro 	 viruses 	 	.
and	let	's	face	it	,	any	new	 retro 	 virus 	 	in	the	human	population	--	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	we	should	be	aware	of	.
it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	we	should	be	 follow 	 ing 	 	.	it	's	not	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	should	be	 surprise 	 d 	 	by	.
 needle 	 s 	 s 	 	to	say	in	the	past	these	viruses	 enter 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	these	 r 	 ural 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	might	 ver 	 y 	 	well	have	gone	extinct	.
that	's	no	 long 	 er 	 	the	case	.	logging	 road 	 s 	 	provide	access	to	urban	 area 	 s 	 	.
and	 critical 	 ly 	 	,	what	 happen 	 s 	 	in	central	africa	 do 	 es 	 	n't	stay	in	central	africa	.
so	,	once	we	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	possible	that	we	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	 th 	 is 	 	 monitor 	 ing 	 	,	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	move	 th 	 is 	 	from	research	,	to	 re 	 ally 	 	attempt	to	phase	up	to	a	global	 monitor 	 ing 	 	effort	.
through	 gen 	 er 	 ous 	 	support	and	 partner 	 ship 	 	 scientific 	 ally 	 	with	google.org	and	the	skoll	 found 	 ation 	 	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	start	the	global	viral	 fore 	 cast 	 ing 	 	 initi 	 ative 	 	and	begin	work	in	four	different	 s 	 ites 	 	in	africa	and	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	.
 needle 	 s 	 s 	 	to	say	,	different	 population 	 s 	 	from	different	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	world	have	different	 sort 	 s 	 	of	contact	.
so	it	's	not	just	 hunter 	 s 	 	in	central	africa	.
