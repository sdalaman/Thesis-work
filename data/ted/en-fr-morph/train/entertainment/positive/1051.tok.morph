if	we	look	around	us	,	much	of	what	 surround 	 s 	 	us	 start 	 ed 	 	life	 a 	 s 	 	 vari 	 ous 	 	 rock 	 s 	 	and	sludge	buried	in	the	ground	in	 vari 	 ous 	 	 place 	 s 	 	in	the	world	.
but	,	of	course	,	they	do	n't	look	like	 rock 	 s 	 	and	sludge	now	.	they	look	like	tv	 camera 	 s 	 	,	 monitor 	 s 	 	,	 annoy 	 ing 	 	radio	 mic 	 s 	 	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	 magic 	 al 	 	 transform 	 ation 	 	is	what	i	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	at	with	my	project	,	which	 be 	 came 	 	known	 a 	 s 	 	the	 toast 	 er 	 	project	.
and	it	was	 al 	 so 	 	inspired	by	 th 	 is 	 	quote	from	douglas	adams	,
and	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	is	from	``	the	hitchhiker	's	guide	to	the	 galax 	 y 	 	.	``
and	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	it	 de 	 scribe 	 s 	 	is	the	hero	of	the	book	--	he	's	a	20th	-	century	man	--	 find 	 s 	 	 him 	 self 	 	 al 	 one 	 	on	a	strange	planet	 populate 	 d 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	by	a	 techno 	 logically 	 	primitive	people	.
and	he	kind	of	 assum 	 es 	 	that	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	he	'll	 be 	 come 	 	--	these	 village 	 rs 	 	--	he	'll	 be 	 come 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	emperor	and	transform	 the 	 ir 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	with	his	 wonder 	 ful 	 	command	of	technology	and	science	and	the	 element 	 s 	 	,	but	,	of	course	,	 real 	 ize 	 s 	 	that	 with 	 out 	 	the	rest	of	human	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	he	can	 bare 	 ly 	 	make	a	sandwich	,	let	 al 	 one 	 	a	 toast 	 er 	 	.
but	he	did	n't	have	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	.
so	i	thought	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	i	'll	try	and	make	an	electric	 toast 	 er 	 	from	scratch	.
and	,	 work 	 ing 	 	on	the	idea	that	the	 cheap 	 est 	 	electric	 toast 	 er 	 	would	 al 	 so 	 	be	the	 simpl 	 est 	 	to	reverse	-	engineer	,	i	went	and	 b 	 ought 	 	the	 cheap 	 est 	 	 toast 	 er 	 	i	could	find	,	took	it	home	and	was	kind	of	 dis 	 may 	 ed 	 	to	discover	that	,	 in 	 side 	 	 th 	 is 	 	object	,	which	i	'd	 b 	 ought 	 	for	just	3.49	 pound 	 s 	 	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	400	different	bits	made	out	of	a	hundred	-	plus	different	 material 	 s 	 	.
i	did	n't	have	the	rest	of	my	life	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	project	.	i	had	 may 	 be 	 	nine	 month 	 s 	 	.
so	i	thought	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	i	'll	start	with	five	.
and	these	 we 	 re 	 	steel	,	 mic 	 a 	 	,	plastic	,	 cop 	 per 	 	and	nickel	.
so	,	 start 	 ing 	 	with	steel	:	how	do	you	make	steel	?
i	went	and	 knock 	 ed 	 	on	the	door	of	the	rio	tinto	chair	of	 advance 	 d 	 	mineral	 extra 	 ction 	 	at	the	royal	school	of	 mine 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	how	do	you	make	steel	?	``	and	professor	cilliers	was	 ver 	 y 	 	kind	and	 talk 	 ed 	 	me	through	it	.
and	my	vague	 remember 	 ing 	 s 	 	from	gcse	science	--	well	,	steel	 come 	 s 	 	from	iron	,	so	i	 phone 	 d 	 	up	an	iron	mine	.
and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	hi	,	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	a	 toast 	 er 	 	.
can	i	come	up	and	get	some	iron	?	``	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	when	i	got	there	--	 emerge 	 s 	 	ray	.
he	had	 mis 	 heard 	 	me	and	thought	i	was	coming	up	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	a	 post 	 er 	 	,	and	so	was	n't	prepared	to	take	me	 in 	 to 	 	the	 mine 	 s 	 	.
but	after	some	 nag 	 ging 	 	,	i	got	him	to	do	that	.
ray	:	it	was	crease	 lime 	 stone 	 	,
and	that	was	 produce 	 d 	 	by	sea	 creature 	 s 	 	350	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	in	a	nice	,	warm	,	 s 	 un 	 ny 	 	atmosphere	.
when	you	 stud 	 y 	 	 geo 	 logy 	 	,	you	can	see	what	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	past	,
and	there	 we 	 re 	 	 terr 	 ific 	 	 change 	 s 	 	in	the	earth	.
thomas	thwaites	:	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	they	had	the	christmas	 decor 	 ations 	 	up	.
and	of	course	,	it	was	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 work 	 ing 	 	mine	 any 	 more 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	ray	was	a	 min 	 er 	 	there	,	the	mine	had	closed	and	had	 be 	 en 	 	 re 	 open 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	tourist	 attract 	 ion 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	of	course	,	it	ca	n't	compete	on	the	scale	of	 operation 	 s 	 	which	are	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	south	america	,	australia	,	 where 	 ver 	 	.
but	 any 	 way 	 	,	i	got	my	 suit 	 case 	 	of	iron	ore	and	 drag 	 ged 	 	it	back	to	london	on	the	train	,	and	then	was	 face 	 d 	 	with	the	problem	:	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	how	do	you	make	 th 	 is 	 	rock	 in 	 to 	 	 component 	 s 	 	for	a	 toast 	 er 	 	?
so	i	went	back	to	professor	cilliers	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	go	to	the	library	.	``	so	i	did	and	was	looking	through	the	 under 	 graduate 	 	 text 	 book 	 s 	 	on	 metal 	 lu 	 rgy 	 	--	 complete 	 ly 	 	 use 	 less 	 	for	what	i	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	of	course	,	they	do	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	tell	you	how	to	do	it	if	you	want	to	do	it	 your 	 self 	 	and	you	do	n't	have	a	 s 	 melt 	 ing 	 	plant	.
so	i	 end 	 ed 	 	up	going	to	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	science	library	and	looking	at	 th 	 is 	 	book	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	 text 	 book 	 	on	 metal 	 lu 	 rgy 	 	written	in	the	west	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	.
and	there	you	can	see	that	 wood 	 cut 	 	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	what	i	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 do 	 ing 	 	.
but	 in 	 stead 	 	of	a	 bel 	 low 	 s 	 	,	i	had	a	leaf	 blow 	 er 	 	.
and	that	was	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 re 	 occur 	 red 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	project	,
was	,	the	 small 	 er 	 	the	scale	you	want	to	work	on	,	the	further	back	in	time	you	have	to	go	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	after	a	day	and	about	half	a	night	 s 	 melt 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	iron	.
i	 drag 	 ged 	 	out	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	,	and	it	was	n't	iron	.
but	 luck 	 ily 	 	,	i	found	a	patent	 on 	 line 	 	for	industrial	 furnace 	 s 	 	that	use	 micro 	 wave 	 s 	 	,
and	at	30	 minute 	 s 	 	at	full	power	,	and	i	was	able	to	finish	off	the	process	.
so	,	my	next	--	the	next	thing	i	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	was	 cop 	 per 	 	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	mine	was	once	the	largest	 cop 	 per 	 	mine	in	the	world	.
it	's	not	 any 	 more 	 	,
but	i	found	a	 retire 	 d 	 	 geo 	 logy 	 	professor	to	take	me	down	,
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	i	'll	let	you	have	some	water	from	the	mine	.	``	and	the	reason	i	was	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 get 	 ting 	 	water	is	 be 	 cause 	 	water	which	 go 	 es 	 	through	 mine 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	kind	of	 acid 	 ic 	 	and	will	start	 pick 	 ing 	 	up	,	 dis 	 solving 	 	the	 mineral 	 s 	 	from	the	mine	.
and	a	good	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	rio	tinto	,	which	is	in	portugal	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	it	's	got	 lot 	 s 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 mineral 	 s 	 	 dis 	 solve 	 d 	 	in	it	.
so	 man 	 y 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	that	it	's	now	just	a	home	for	bacteria	who	 re 	 ally 	 	like	 acid 	 ic 	 	,	toxic	 condition 	 s 	 	.
but	 any 	 way 	 	,	the	water	i	 drag 	 ged 	 	back	from	the	isle	of	anglesey	where	the	mine	was	--	there	was	 en 	 ough 	 	 cop 	 per 	 	in	it	 s 	 uch 	 	that	i	could	cast	the	 pin 	 s 	 	of	my	metal	electric	plug	.
so	my	next	thing	:	i	was	off	to	scotland	to	get	 mic 	 a 	 	.
and	 mic 	 a 	 	is	a	mineral	which	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 insula 	 tor 	 	and	 ver 	 y 	 	good	at	 insula 	 ting 	 	 electric 	 ity 	 	.
that	's	me	 get 	 ting 	 	 mic 	 a 	 	.
and	the	last	material	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	 to 	 day 	 	is	plastic	,
and	,	of	course	,	my	 toast 	 er 	 	had	to	have	a	plastic	case	.
plastic	is	the	 defi 	 ning 	 	feature	of	cheap	 electric 	 al 	 	 good 	 s 	 	.
and	so	plastic	 come 	 s 	 	from	oil	,	so	i	 phone 	 d 	 	up	bp	and	 s 	 pent 	 	a	good	half	an	hour	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 con 	 vince 	 	the	pr	 off 	 ice 	 	at	bp	that	it	would	be	fantastic	for	them	if	they	flew	me	to	an	oil	rig	and	let	me	have	a	jug	of	oil	.
bp	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	bit	more	on	 the 	 ir 	 	mind	now	.
but	even	then	they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	we	'll	phone	you	back	``	--	never	did	.
so	i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	other	ways	of	making	plastic	.
and	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	make	plastic	from	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 oil 	 s 	 	which	come	from	 plant 	 s 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	from	 starch 	 es 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 attempt 	 ing 	 	to	make	potato	starch	plastic	.
and	for	a	while	that	was	looking	 re 	 ally 	 	good	.
i	 pour 	 ed 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	the	mold	,	which	you	can	see	there	,	which	i	've	made	from	a	tree	trunk	.
and	it	was	looking	good	for	a	while	,
but	i	left	it	 out 	 side 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	had	to	 leav 	 e 	 	it	 out 	 side 	 	to	dry	,	and	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	i	came	back	and	there	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 nail 	 s 	 	eating	the	 un 	 hydro 	 ly 	 z 	 ed 	 	bits	of	potato	.
so	kind	of	out	of	 de 	 s 	 per 	 ation 	 	,	i	 decide 	 d 	 	that	i	could	think	 lateral 	 ly 	 	.
and	 geo 	 logists 	 	have	 actual 	 ly 	 	 christen 	 ed 	 	--	well	,	they	're	 deb 	 ating 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	to	christen	--	the	age	that	we	're	living	in	--	they	're	 deb 	 ating 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	to	make	it	a	new	 geo 	 logical 	 	epoch	 call 	 ed 	 	the	anthropocene	,	the	age	of	man	.
and	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	 geo 	 logists 	 	of	the	future	would	kind	of	see	a	sharp	shift	in	the	 strat 	 a 	 	of	rock	that	is	 be 	 ing 	 	laid	down	now	.
so	 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	it	will	 be 	 come 	 	kind	of	 radio 	 active 	 	from	chernobyl	and	the	2,000	or	so	nuclear	 bomb 	 s 	 	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	set	off	since	1945	.
and	there	'd	 al 	 so 	 	be	an	 extinct 	 ion 	 	event	--	like	 fossil 	 s 	 	would	 sudden 	 ly 	 	disappear	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	,	i	thought	that	there	would	be	synthetic	 polymer 	 s 	 	,	 plastic 	 s 	 	,	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	in	the	rock	.
so	i	 look 	 ed 	 	up	a	plastic	--	so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	that	i	could	mine	some	of	 th 	 is 	 	modern	-	day	rock	.
and	i	went	up	to	manchester	to	visit	a	place	 call 	 ed 	 	axion	 recycl 	 ing 	 	.
and	they	're	at	the	sharp	end	of	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	weee	,	which	is	 th 	 is 	 	european	 electric 	 al 	 	and	 electron 	 ic 	 	waste	 direct 	 ive 	 	.
and	that	was	 br 	 ought 	 	 in 	 to 	 	force	to	try	and	deal	with	the	mountain	of	stuff	that	is	just	 be 	 ing 	 	made	and	then	living	for	a	while	in	our	 home 	 s 	 	and	then	going	to	 land 	 fill 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	it	.
so	there	's	a	picture	of	my	 toast 	 er 	 	.	that	's	it	 with 	 out 	 	the	case	on	.
and	there	it	is	on	the	 shelv 	 es 	 	.
 thank 	 s 	 	.	bruno	giussani	:	i	'm	told	you	did	plug	it	in	once	.
tt	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	i	did	plug	it	in	.
i	do	n't	know	if	you	could	see	,	but	i	was	never	able	to	make	 insula 	 tion 	 	for	the	 wire 	 s 	 	.
kew	 garden 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 insist 	 ent 	 	that	i	could	n't	come	and	hack	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	rubber	tree	.
so	the	 wire 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 un 	 insulate 	 d 	 	.	so	there	was	240	 volt 	 s 	 	going	through	these	 home 	 made 	 	 cop 	 per 	 	 wire 	 s 	 	,	 home 	 made 	 	plug	.
and	for	about	five	 second 	 s 	 	,	the	 toast 	 er 	 	 toast 	 ed 	 	,	but	then	,	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	the	element	kind	of	 melt 	 ed 	 	 it 	 self 	 	.
but	i	 consider 	 ed 	 	it	a	partial	success	,	to	be	honest	.
