so	,	i	am	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	going	to	talk	about	the	 space 	 s 	 	men	create	for	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,
but	first	i	want	to	tell	you	why	i	'm	here	.
i	'm	here	for	two	 reason 	 s 	 	.	these	two	 guy 	 s 	 	are	my	two	 son 	 s 	 	ford	and	wren	.
when	ford	was	about	three	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	we	 share 	 d 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	room	together	,	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	space	.
my	 off 	 ice 	 	was	on	one	half	of	the	 bed 	 room 	 	,	and	his	 bed 	 room 	 	was	on	the	other	half	.
and	you	can	imagine	,	if	you	're	a	writer	,	that	 thing 	 s 	 	would	get	 re 	 ally 	 	 crowd 	 ed 	 	around	 dead 	 lines 	 	.
so	when	wren	was	on	the	way	,	i	 real 	 ized 	 	i	 need 	 ed 	 	to	find	a	space	of	my	own	.
there	was	no	more	space	in	the	house	.	so	i	went	out	to	the	 back 	 yard 	 	,
and	 with 	 out 	 	any	previous	building	experience	,	and	about	3,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	and	some	 recycl 	 ed 	 	 material 	 s 	 	,	i	built	 th 	 is 	 	space	.
it	had	 every 	 thing 	 	i	 need 	 ed 	 	.	it	was	quiet	.
there	was	 en 	 ough 	 	space	.	and	i	had	control	,	which	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	was	building	 th 	 is 	 	space	,	i	thought	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	``	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	i	'm	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	guy	to	have	to	have	 carv 	 ed 	 	out	a	space	for	his	own	.	``
so	i	did	some	research	.
and	i	found	that	there	was	an	historic	 precede 	 nce 	 	.
hemingway	had	his	writing	space	.
elvis	had	two	or	three	 man 	 space 	 s 	 	,	which	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	 un 	 ique 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	he	lived	with	both	his	wife	and	his	mother	in	graceland	.
in	the	popular	culture	,	 super 	 man 	 	had	the	fortress	of	 s 	 ol 	 itude 	 	,
and	there	was	,	of	course	,	the	batcave	.
so	i	 real 	 ized 	 	then	that	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	go	out	on	a	journey	and	see	what	 guy 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	creating	for	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	now	.
here	is	one	of	the	first	 space 	 s 	 	i	found	.	it	is	in	austin	,	texas	,	which	is	where	i	'm	from	.
on	the	 out 	 side 	 	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	 ver 	 y 	 	typical	 gar 	 age 	 	,	a	nice	 gar 	 age 	 	.
but	on	the	 in 	 side 	 	,	it	's	 any 	 thing 	 	but	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	,	to	me	,	is	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	classic	 man 	 space 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	 ne 	 on 	 	concert	 post 	 ers 	 	,	a	bar	and	,	of	course	,	the	leg	lamp	,	which	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
i	soon	 real 	 ized 	 	that	 man 	 space 	 s 	 	did	n't	have	to	be	 on 	 ly 	 	 in 	 side 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	guy	built	a	 bowl 	 ing 	 	 al 	 ley 	 	in	his	 back 	 yard 	 	,	out	of	 land 	 s 	 cap 	 ing 	 	 timber 	 s 	 	,	 astro 	 turf 	 	.
and	he	found	the	 score 	 board 	 	in	the	trash	.
here	's	 an 	 other 	 	 out 	 door 	 	space	,	a	little	bit	more	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	a	1923	 wood 	 en 	 	 tug 	 boat 	 	,	made	 complete 	 ly 	 	out	of	douglas	fir	.	the	guy	did	it	all	 him 	 self 	 	.
and	there	is	about	1,000	square	feet	of	 hang 	 ing 	 	-	out	space	 in 	 side 	 	.
so	,	 pre 	 tty 	 	early	on	in	my	 investigation 	 s 	 	i	 real 	 ized 	 	what	i	was	 find 	 ing 	 	was	not	what	i	 expect 	 ed 	 	to	find	,	which	was	,	 quit 	 e 	 	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	a	lot	of	beer	can	 pyramid 	 s 	 	and	 over 	 stuff 	 ed 	 	 couch 	 es 	 	and	flat	-	screen	tvs	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	 definite 	 ly 	 	hang	-	out	 spot 	 s 	 	.	but	some	 we 	 re 	 	for	 work 	 ing 	 	,	some	 we 	 re 	 	for	 play 	 ing 	 	,
some	 we 	 re 	 	for	 guy 	 s 	 	to	collect	 the 	 ir 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
most	of	all	,	i	was	just	 surprise 	 d 	 	with	what	i	was	 find 	 ing 	 	.
take	 th 	 is 	 	place	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
on	the	 out 	 side 	 	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	typical	 north 	 eastern 	 	 gar 	 age 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	in	long	 is 	 land 	 	,	new	york	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	that	might	tip	you	off	is	the	round	window	.
on	the	 in 	 side 	 	it	's	a	 re 	 creation 	 	of	a	16th	century	japanese	tea	house	.
the	man	 import 	 ed 	 	all	the	 material 	 s 	 	from	japan	,	and	he	 hire 	 d 	 	a	japanese	 carp 	 enter 	 	to	build	it	in	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	style	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	no	 nail 	 s 	 	or	 screw 	 s 	 	.
all	the	 joint 	 s 	 	are	hand	-	 carv 	 ed 	 	and	hand	-	scribed	.
here	is	 an 	 other 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	typical	scene	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 sub 	 urban 	 	las	vegas	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	.
but	you	open	one	of	the	 gar 	 age 	 	 door 	 s 	 	and	there	is	a	professional	-	 s 	 ize 	 	 box 	 ing 	 	ring	 in 	 side 	 	.
and	so	there	is	a	good	reason	for	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	was	built	by	 th 	 is 	 	man	who	is	wayne	mccullough	.
he	won	the	silver	 med 	 al 	 	for	ireland	in	the	1992	olympics	,
and	he	 train 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	space	.	he	 train 	 s 	 	other	people	.
and	right	off	the	 gar 	 age 	 	he	 ha 	 s 	 	his	own	trophy	room	where	he	can	sort	of	bask	in	his	 accomplish 	 ments 	 	,
which	is	 an 	 other 	 	sort	of	 import 	 ant 	 	part	about	a	 man 	 space 	 	.
so	,	while	 th 	 is 	 	space	 represent 	 s 	 	 some 	 one 	 	's	profession	,	 th 	 is 	 	one	 certain 	 ly 	 	 represent 	 s 	 	a	 pass 	 ion 	 	.
it	's	made	to	look	like	the	 in 	 side 	 	of	an	english	 s 	 ailing 	 	ship	.
it	's	a	 collect 	 ion 	 	of	 naut 	 ical 	 	 anti 	 que 	 s 	 	from	the	1700s	and	1800s	.	museum	quality	.
so	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	came	to	the	end	of	my	journey	,
i	found	over	50	 space 	 s 	 	.	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	surprising	.
but	they	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 so 	 	--	i	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 impress 	 ed 	 	by	how	 personal 	 ized 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	,	and	how	much	work	went	 in 	 to 	 	them	.
and	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 guy 	 s 	 	that	i	met	 we 	 re 	 	all	 ver 	 y 	 	passionate	about	what	they	did	.
and	they	 re 	 ally 	 	 love 	 d 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 profession 	 s 	 	.
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	passionate	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 collect 	 ions 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 hob 	 bie 	 s 	 	.
and	so	they	 create 	 d 	 	these	 space 	 s 	 	to	reflect	what	they	love	to	do	,	and	who	they	 we 	 re 	 	.
so	if	you	do	n't	have	a	space	of	your	own	,	i	 high 	 ly 	 	recommend	 find 	 ing 	 	one	,	and	 get 	 ting 	 	 in 	 to 	 	it	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
