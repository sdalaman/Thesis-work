i	had	 request 	 ed 	 	 slide 	 s 	 	,	kind	of	 adamant 	 ly 	 	,	up	till	the	--	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	,	last	few	 day 	 s 	 	,	but	was	 deni 	 ed 	 	access	to	a	slide	 project 	 or 	 	.	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	find	them	a	lot	more	 emotion 	 al 	 	--	--	and	personal	,	and	the	neat	thing	about	a	slide	 project 	 or 	 	is	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	focus	the	work	,	 un 	 like 	 	powerpoint	and	some	other	 program 	 s 	 	.
now	,	i	agree	that	you	have	to	--	 yea 	 h 	 	,	there	are	certain	 concession 	 s 	 	and	,	you	know	,	if	you	use	a	slide	 project 	 or 	 	,	you	're	not	able	to	have	the	bad	type	 s 	 wing 	 	in	from	the	back	or	the	side	,	or	up	or	down	,	but	 may 	 be 	 	that	's	an	o.k	.	trade	-	off	,	to	trade	that	off	for	a	focus	.
it	's	a	thought	.	just	a	thought	.
and	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	nice	about	 slide 	 s 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 s 	 tuck 	 	.
and	the	thing	you	 re 	 ally 	 	hope	for	is	 occasion 	 ally 	 	they	burn	up	,	which	we	wo	n't	see	 to 	 night 	 	.	so	.
with	that	,	let	's	get	the	first	slide	up	here	.	 th 	 is 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	have	 prob 	 ably 	 	 guess 	 ed 	 	,	is	a	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 empti 	 ed 	 	beer	can	in	portugal	.
 th 	 is 	 	--	i	had	just	 arriv 	 ed 	 	in	barcelona	for	the	first	time	,	and	i	thought	--	you	know	,	fly	all	night	,	i	 look 	 ed 	 	up	,	and	i	thought	,	 w 	 ow 	 	,	how	clean	.
you	come	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	major	 air 	 port 	 	,	and	they	 simpl 	 y 	 	have	a	b	.
i	mean	,	how	nice	is	that	?
 every 	 thing 	 	's	gotten	 simpl 	 er 	 	in	design	,	and	here	's	 th 	 is 	 	mega	 air 	 port 	 	,	and	god	,	i	just	--	i	took	a	picture	.
i	thought	,	god	,	that	is	the	 cool 	 est 	 	thing	i	've	ever	 s 	 een 	 	at	an	 air 	 port 	 	.
till	a	couple	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	i	went	back	to	the	same	 air 	 port 	 	--	same	plane	,	i	think	--	and	 look 	 ed 	 	up	,	and	it	 s 	 aid 	 	c	.
it	was	 on 	 ly 	 	then	that	i	 real 	 ized 	 	it	was	 simpl 	 y 	 	a	gate	that	i	was	coming	 in 	 to 	 	.
i	'm	a	big	 believ 	 er 	 	in	the	emotion	of	design	,	and	the	 mess 	 age 	 	that	's	 s 	 ent 	 	before	 some 	 body 	 	 begin 	 s 	 	to	read	,	before	they	get	the	rest	of	the	information	;	what	is	the	 emotion 	 al 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	they	get	to	the	product	,	to	the	story	,	to	the	 paint 	 ing 	 	--	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	.
that	area	of	design	 interest 	 s 	 	me	the	most	,	and	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	for	me	is	a	real	clear	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 simpl 	 ified 	 	version	of	what	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	.
these	are	a	couple	of	 gar 	 age 	 	 door 	 s 	 	 paint 	 ed 	 	 ident 	 ical 	 	,	 situ 	 ated 	 	next	to	each	other	.
so	,	here	's	the	first	door	.	you	know	,	you	get	the	 mess 	 age 	 	.
you	know	,	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	clear	.
take	a	look	at	the	second	door	and	see	if	there	's	any	different	 mess 	 age 	 	.
o.k	.	,	which	one	would	you	park	in	front	of	?
same	color	,	same	 mess 	 age 	 	,	same	 word 	 s 	 	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	that	's	different	is	the	 express 	 ion 	 	that	the	individual	door	-	owner	here	put	 in 	 to 	 	the	piece	--	and	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	which	is	the	psycho	-	killer	here	?
yet	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	say	that	;	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	need	to	say	that	.
i	would	 prob 	 ably 	 	park	in	front	of	the	other	one	.
i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	a	lot	of	you	are	aware	that	graphic	design	 ha 	 s 	 	gotten	a	lot	 simpl 	 er 	 	in	the	last	five	 year 	 s 	 	or	so	.
it	's	gotten	so	simple	that	it	's	 al 	 ready 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	to	kind	of	come	back	the	other	way	 aga 	 in 	 	and	get	a	little	more	 express 	 ive 	 	.
but	i	was	in	milan	and	saw	 th 	 is 	 	street	sign	,	and	was	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	to	see	that	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	 minimal 	 ism 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	even	 be 	 en 	 	 transl 	 ated 	 	by	the	graffiti	artist	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	graffiti	artist	 ha 	 s 	 	come	 a 	 long 	 	,	made	 th 	 is 	 	sign	a	little	bit	better	,	and	then	 move 	 d 	 	on	.
he	did	n't	 over 	 power 	 	it	like	they	have	a	 tend 	 ency 	 	to	do	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	for	a	book	by	``	 metro 	 poli 	 s 	 	.	``
i	took	some	 photo 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 bill 	 board 	 	in	florida	,	and	either	they	had	n't	paid	 the 	 ir 	 	rent	,	or	they	did	n't	want	to	pay	 the 	 ir 	 	rent	 aga 	 in 	 	on	the	sign	,	and	the	 bill 	 board 	 	people	 we 	 re 	 	too	cheap	to	tear	the	whole	sign	down	,	so	they	just	 tear 	 ed 	 	out	 section 	 s 	 	of	it	.
and	i	would	 argu 	 e 	 	that	it	's	possibly	more	effective	than	the	original	 bill 	 board 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 get 	 ting 	 	your	attention	,	 get 	 ting 	 	you	to	look	over	that	way	.
and	 hope 	 fully 	 	you	do	n't	stop	and	buy	 t 	 hose 	 	awful	 pe 	 can 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	--	stuckey	's	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	from	my	second	book	.
the	first	book	is	 call 	 ed 	 	,	``	the	end	of	print	,	``	and	it	was	 d 	 one 	 	 a 	 long 	 	with	a	film	,	 work 	 ing 	 	with	william	burroughs	.
and	``	the	end	of	print	``	is	now	in	 it 	 s 	 	fifth	 print 	 ing 	 	.
when	i	first	 contact 	 ed 	 	william	burroughs	about	 be 	 ing 	 	part	of	it	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	no	;	he	 s 	 aid 	 	he	did	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	it	was	the	end	of	print	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	well	,	that	's	fine	;	i	just	would	love	to	have	your	 in 	 put 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	film	and	 th 	 is 	 	book	,	and	he	 final 	 ly 	 	 agree 	 d 	 	to	it	.
and	at	the	end	of	the	film	,	he	 say 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	great	voice	that	i	ca	n't	mimic	but	i	'll	kind	of	try	,	but	not	 re 	 ally 	 	,	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	remember	 attend 	 ing 	 	an	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	,	'	 photograph 	 y 	 	:	the	end	of	 paint 	 ing 	 	.	'	``	and	then	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	and	,	of	course	,	it	was	n't	at	all	.	``
so	,	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	when	 photograph 	 y 	 	was	 perfect 	 ed 	 	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	people	going	around	 say 	 ing 	 	,	that	's	it	:	you	've	just	 ruin 	 ed 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 	.
people	are	just	going	to	take	 picture 	 s 	 	now	.
and	of	course	,	that	was	n't	the	case	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	from	``	2nd	sight	,	``	a	book	i	did	on	 intuit 	 ion 	 	.
i	think	it	's	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 	in	design	,	but	possibly	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	.
it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	 every 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	.
it	's	not	a	matter	of	 teach 	 ing 	 	it	;	in	fact	,	most	of	the	 school 	 s 	 	tend	to	 dis 	 count 	 	 intuit 	 ion 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 	of	your	 work 	 ing 	 	process	 be 	 cause 	 	they	ca	n't	 quant 	 ify 	 	it	:	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	teach	people	the	four	 step 	 s 	 	to	intuitive	design	,	but	we	can	teach	you	the	four	 step 	 s 	 	to	a	nice	business	card	or	a	 news 	 letter 	 	.
so	it	 tend 	 s 	 	to	get	 dis 	 count 	 ed 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	quote	from	albert	einstein	,	who	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	the	 in 	 tell 	 ect 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	little	to	do	on	the	road	to	 discover 	 y 	 	.
there	 come 	 s 	 	a	leap	in	 conscious 	 ness 	 	--	call	it	 intuit 	 ion 	 	or	what	you	will	--	and	the	solution	just	 come 	 s 	 	to	you	,	and	you	do	n't	know	from	where	or	why	.	``
so	,	it	's	kind	of	like	when	 some 	 body 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	who	did	that	song	?
and	the	more	you	try	to	think	about	it	,	the	further	the	answer	 get 	 s 	 	from	you	,	and	the	minute	you	stop	 think 	 ing 	 	about	it	,	your	 intuit 	 ion 	 	 give 	 s 	 	you	that	answer	,	in	a	sense	.
i	like	 th 	 is 	 	for	a	couple	of	 reason 	 s 	 	.
if	you	've	had	any	design	 course 	 s 	 	,	they	would	teach	you	you	ca	n't	read	 th 	 is 	 	.	i	think	you	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	can	and	,	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	i	think	it	's	true	.
``	do	n't	 mistak 	 e 	 	 leg 	 ibility 	 	for	communication	.	``
just	 be 	 cause 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	's	 leg 	 ible 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 mean 	 s 	 	it	 communicate 	 s 	 	.
more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	it	 communicate 	 s 	 	the	right	thing	.
so	,	what	is	the	 mess 	 age 	 	 s 	 ent 	 	before	 some 	 body 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 get 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	material	?
and	i	think	that	's	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	an	 overlook 	 ed 	 	area	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 work 	 ing 	 	with	marshall	mcluhan	.
i	 stay 	 ed 	 	and	 work 	 ed 	 	with	his	wife	and	son	,	eric	,	and	we	came	up	with	close	to	600	 quote 	 s 	 	from	marshall	that	are	just	 amaz 	 ing 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 a 	 head 	 	of	the	 time 	 s 	 	,	 predict 	 ing 	 	so	much	of	what	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	,	 tele 	 vision 	 	,	media	world	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	book	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 prob 	 es 	 	.	``	it	's	 an 	 other 	 	word	for	 quote 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	--	a	lot	of	them	are	never	--	have	never	 be 	 en 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	before	,	and	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	i	've	 interpret 	 ed 	 	the	different	 quote 	 s 	 	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	 content 	 s 	 	page	 original 	 ly 	 	.
when	i	got	 d 	 one 	 	it	was	540	 page 	 s 	 	,	and	then	the	 publish 	 er 	 	,	gingko	press	,	 end 	 ed 	 	up	cutting	it	down	 consider 	 ably 	 	:	it	's	just	under	400	 page 	 s 	 	now	.
but	i	 decide 	 d 	 	i	 like 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 content 	 s 	 	page	--	i	 like 	 d 	 	the	way	it	 look 	 s 	 	--	so	i	 ke 	 pt 	 	it	.
it	now	 ha 	 s 	 	no	relevance	to	the	book	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	,	but	it	's	a	nice	spread	,	i	think	,	in	there	.
so	,	a	couple	 spread 	 s 	 	from	the	book	:	here	mcluhan	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	the	new	media	are	not	 bridge 	 s 	 	between	man	and	nature	;	they	are	nature	.	``
``	the	 invent 	 ion 	 	of	 print 	 ing 	 	did	away	with	 anonym 	 ity 	 	,	 foster 	 ing 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	of	 liter 	 ary 	 	fame	and	the	habit	of	 consider 	 ing 	 	intellectual	effort	 a 	 s 	 	private	 proper 	 ty 	 	,	``
which	had	never	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	before	 print 	 ing 	 	.	``	when	new	 techno 	 logies 	 	impose	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	on	 socie 	 ties 	 	long	 habitu 	 ated 	 	to	 old 	 er 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	 anxie 	 ties 	 	of	all	 kind 	 s 	 	result	.	``
``	while	people	are	 engag 	 ed 	 	in	creating	a	 total 	 ly 	 	different	world	,	they	 al 	 ways 	 	form	 vivi 	 d 	 	 image 	 s 	 	of	the	 p 	 reced 	 ing 	 	world	.	``
i	hate	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	.	it	's	hard	to	read	.
``	people	in	the	 electron 	 ic 	 	age	have	no	possible	environment	 ex 	 cept 	 	the	 glob 	 e 	 	,	and	no	possible	occupation	 ex 	 cept 	 	information	 gather 	 ing 	 	.	``
that	was	it	.	that	's	all	he	saw	 a 	 s 	 	the	 option 	 s 	 	.	and	not	too	far	off	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	project	for	nine	inch	 nail 	 s 	 	.
and	i	 on 	 ly 	 	show	it	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 seem 	 ed 	 	like	it	got	all	 th 	 is 	 	 r 	 elev 	 ancy 	 	all	of	a	sudden	,	and	it	was	 d 	 one 	 	right	after	9/11	.
and	i	had	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	a	bomb	shelter	in	the	 back 	 yard 	 	of	a	house	i	had	 b 	 ought 	 	in	la	that	the	real	 e 	 state 	 	person	had	n't	 point 	 ed 	 	out	.
there	was	some	bomb	shelter	built	,	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	in	the	'60s	cuban	 mis 	 s 	 ile 	 	crisis	.
and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	real	 e 	 state 	 	guy	what	it	was	 a 	 s 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	 walk 	 ing 	 	by	,	and	he	 go 	 es 	 	,	``	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	to	do	with	the	 sew 	 age 	 	system	.	``
i	was	,	o.k	.	;	that	's	fine	.
i	 final 	 ly 	 	went	down	there	,	and	it	was	 th 	 is 	 	old	 rust 	 ed 	 	 circul 	 ar 	 	thing	,	and	two	 bed 	 s 	 	,	and	 ver 	 y 	 	kind	of	 creep 	 y 	 	and	weird	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	,	 surprising 	 ly 	 	,	it	was	 d 	 one 	 	in	kind	of	a	cheap	metal	,	and	it	had	 complete 	 ly 	 	 rust 	 ed 	 	through	,	and	water	 every 	 where 	 	,	and	 spider 	 s 	 	.
and	i	thought	,	you	know	,	what	 we 	 re 	 	they	 think 	 ing 	 	?
you	'd	think	 may 	 be 	 	cement	,	possibly	,	or	 some 	 thing 	 	.
but	 any 	 way 	 	,	i	used	 th 	 is 	 	for	a	cover	for	the	nine	inch	 nail 	 s 	 	dvd	,	and	i	've	 al 	 so 	 	now	 fix 	 ed 	 	the	bomb	shelter	with	duct	tape	,	and	it	's	ready	.	i	think	i	'm	ready	.	so	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	experiment	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	for	a	client	,	quicksilver	,	where	we	 we 	 re 	 	taking	what	was	a	six	-	shot	sequence	and	 try 	 ing 	 	to	use	print	 a 	 s 	 	a	medium	to	get	people	to	the	web	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	six	-	shot	sequence	.
i	've	taken	one	shot	;	i	 crop 	 ped 	 	it	a	few	different	ways	.
and	then	the	 tin 	 y 	 	line	of	copy	 say 	 s 	 	,	if	you	want	to	see	 th 	 is 	 	entire	sequence	--	how	 th 	 is 	 	whole	ride	was	--	go	to	the	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
and	my	guess	is	that	a	lot	of	the	surf	 kid 	 s 	 	did	go	to	the	 s 	 ite 	 	to	get	 th 	 is 	 	entire	picture	.
got	no	way	of	 track 	 ing 	 	it	,	so	i	could	be	 total 	 ly 	 	wrong	.
i	do	n't	have	the	 s 	 ite 	 	.	it	's	just	the	piece	 it 	 self 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	group	in	new	york	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 coal 	 ition 	 	for	a	smoke	-	free	environment	--	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	to	do	these	 post 	 ers 	 	.

you	ca	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	--	well	,	you	ca	n't	see	it	at	all	--	but	the	second	line	is	 re 	 ally 	 	the	more	kind	of	 pay 	 off 	 	,	in	a	sense	.
it	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	if	the	 cigar 	 ette 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	can	lie	,	then	so	can	we	.	``	but	--	--	but	i	did	.

and	it	was	 purpose 	 ly 	 	 d 	 one 	 	to	look	 fair 	 ly 	 	serious	.
it	was	n't	some	,	you	know	,	weird	grunge	type	or	 some 	 thing 	 	;	it	 look 	 ed 	 	like	they	might	be	real	.	 any 	 way 	 	.
 post 	 er 	 	for	atlantic	center	for	the	 art 	 s 	 	,	a	school	in	florida	.
 th 	 is 	 	 amaze 	 s 	 	me	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	product	i	just	found	out	.
i	was	in	the	caribbean	at	christmas	,	and	i	'm	just	blown	away	that	in	 th 	 is 	 	day	and	age	they	will	still	sell	--	not	that	they	will	sell	--	that	there	is	felt	a	need	for	people	to	 light 	 en 	 	the	color	of	 the 	 ir 	 	skin	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	either	an	old	product	with	new	 pack 	 aging 	 	,	or	a	brand	-	new	package	,	and	i	just	thought	,	yikes	!	how	's	that	still	 happen 	 ing 	 	?
i	do	a	lot	of	 work 	 shop 	 s 	 	all	over	the	world	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	 assign 	 ment 	 	was	to	come	up	with	new	 symbol 	 s 	 	for	the	 rest 	 room 	 	 door 	 s 	 	.
i	felt	 th 	 is 	 	was	one	of	the	more	 success 	 ful 	 	 solution 	 s 	 	.
the	 student 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	cut	them	up	and	put	them	up	around	 bar 	 s 	 	and	 restaurant 	 s 	 	that	night	,	and	i	just	 al 	 ways 	 	have	 th 	 is 	 	vision	of	 th 	 is 	 	 elder 	 ly 	 	couple	going	to	use	the	 rest 	 room 	 	...
i	did	some	work	for	 micro 	 soft 	 	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	back	.
it	was	a	 world 	 wide 	 	 brand 	 ing 	 	campaign	.
and	it	was	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	me	--	my	 back 	 ground 	 	is	in	 socio 	 logy 	 	;	i	had	no	design	training	,	and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	people	say	,	well	,	that	 explain 	 s 	 	it	--	but	it	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	experiment	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	no	product	that	i	had	to	sell	;	it	was	 simpl 	 y 	 	the	image	of	 micro 	 soft 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	improve	.
they	thought	some	people	did	n't	like	them	.
i	found	out	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	true	,	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	campaign	 world 	 wide 	 	.
and	our	goal	was	to	try	to	 human 	 ize 	 	them	a	bit	,	and	what	i	did	was	add	type	and	people	to	the	ad	,	which	the	previous	campaign	had	not	had	,	and	 no 	 body 	 	 remember 	 ed 	 	them	,	and	 no 	 body 	 	 re 	 ference 	 d 	 	them	.
and	we	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	say	that	,	 he 	 y 	 	,	some	of	these	 guy 	 s 	 	that	work	there	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	ok	;	some	of	them	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	 friend 	 s 	 	and	family	,	and	they	're	not	all	awful	people	.
and	the	 um 	 br 	 ella 	 	campaign	was	``	thank	god	it	's	monday	.	``	so	,	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	take	 th 	 is 	 	--	what	was	 perceive 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	negative	:	 the 	 ir 	 	over	-	 competitive 	 ness 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	,	you	know	,	long	 work 	 ing 	 	 hour 	 s 	 	--	and	turn	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	positive	and	not	run	from	it	.
you	know	:	thank	god	it	's	monday	--	i	get	to	go	back	to	that	little	 cubic 	 le 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	fake	gray	 wall 	 s 	 	,	and	hear	 every 	 body 	 	else	's	 conversation 	 s 	 	f	or	10	 hour 	 s 	 	and	then	go	home	.
but	 any 	 way 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	 ad 	 s 	 	i	was	most	 pleas 	 ed 	 	with	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	all	 elaborate 	 ly 	 	art	-	 direct 	 ed 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	one	i	thought	 actual 	 ly 	 	felt	like	the	girl	was	looking	at	the	computer	.
it	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	wonder	around	.	``	and	then	it	's	a	piece	of	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	the	ad	ran	around	the	world	.
in	germany	,	they	made	one	small	change	 with 	 out 	 	 check 	 ing 	 	with	me	--	nor	did	they	have	to	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	 d 	 one 	 	through	 age 	 ncies 	 	--	but	see	if	you	can	tell	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	how	the	ad	ran	 through 	 out 	 	the	world	;	germany	made	one	 s 	 light 	 	change	in	the	ad	.
now	,	there	's	kind	of	two	 issue 	 s 	 	here	.
if	you	're	going	to	put	a	kid	in	the	ad	,	pick	one	that	 look 	 s 	 	 al 	 ive 	 	.
i	just	have	a	 feel 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	kid	's	 be 	 en 	 	there	for	a	week	,	you	know	.
he	's	just	 re 	 ally 	 	 hop 	 ing 	 	that	 boot 	 s 	 	up	and	,	you	know	...
and	then	 a 	 s 	 	the	 age 	 ncy 	 	 explain 	 ed 	 	to	me	,	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	look	,	we	do	n't	have	little	green	people	in	our	country	;	why	would	we	put	little	green	people	in	our	 ad 	 s 	 	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	?	``
so	,	i	understand	 the 	 ir 	 	logic	.	i	 total 	 ly 	 	disagree	with	it	;
i	think	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	-	minded	approach	,	the	world	is	 certain 	 ly 	 	much	more	global	,	and	i	 certain 	 ly 	 	think	the	people	of	germany	could	have	 handle 	 d 	 	a	little	black	girl	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	front	of	a	computer	,	 th 	 ough 	 	we	'll	never	know	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	some	work	from	ray	gun	.
and	the	point	of	 th 	 is 	 	magazine	was	to	read	the	 article 	 s 	 	,	listen	to	the	music	,	and	try	to	interpret	it	.
there	's	no	grid	,	there	's	no	system	,	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	set	up	in	advance	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 open 	 er 	 	for	brian	eno	,	and	it	's	just	kind	of	my	personal	 interpret 	 ation 	 	of	the	music	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 rock 	 star 	 s 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 teacher 	 s 	 	they	had	 lust 	 ed 	 	after	in	school	.
there	's	a	lot	of	great	writing	in	``	ray	gun	.	``
and	i	was	fortunate	to	find	a	photograph	of	a	teacher	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	on	some	 book 	 s 	 	.
article	on	bryan	 ferr 	 y 	 	--	just	 re 	 ally 	 	 bor 	 ing 	 	article	--	so	i	set	the	whole	article	in	dingbat	.
you	could	--	you	could	 high 	 light 	 	it	;	you	could	make	it	helvetica	or	 some 	 thing 	 	:	it	is	the	actual	article	.
i	suppose	you	could	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	decode	it	,	but	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	not	 ver 	 y 	 	well	written	;	it	 re 	 ally 	 	would	n't	be	 worth 	 while 	 	.
 hav 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	a	lot	of	 magazine 	 s 	 	,	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	 cur 	 ious 	 	how	big	 magazine 	 s 	 	handle	big	 st 	 ories 	 	,	and	i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 cur 	 ious 	 	to	see	how	time	and	newsweek	would	handle	9/11	.
and	i	was	 bas 	 ically 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	 disappoint 	 ed 	 	to	see	that	they	had	 chose 	 n 	 	to	show	the	photo	we	'd	 al 	 ready 	 	 s 	 een 	 	a	million	 time 	 s 	 	,	which	was	 bas 	 ically 	 	the	moment	of	impact	.
and	people	magazine	,	i	thought	,	got	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	best	shot	.
it	's	kind	of	 horse 	 y 	 	type	,	but	the	 text 	 ure 	 	--	the	second	plane	not	 quit 	 e 	 	hitting	:	there	was	 some 	 thing 	 	more	 ent 	 ic 	 ing 	 	,	if	that	's	the	right	--	it	's	not	the	right	word	--	but	in	 th 	 is 	 	cover	than	time	or	newsweek	.
but	when	i	got	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	magazine	,	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	kind	of	 disturb 	 ing 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 continu 	 ed 	 	.
on	the	left	we	see	people	 dy 	 ing 	 	;	we	see	people	running	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
and	on	the	right	we	learn	that	there	's	a	new	way	to	support	your	breast	.
the	 cove 	 ted 	 	right	-	hand	page	was	not	 give 	 n 	 	up	to	the	whole	issue	.
look	at	the	image	of	 th 	 is 	 	 lad 	 y 	 	--	who	 know 	 s 	 	what	she	's	going	through	?	--	and	the	copy	 say 	 s 	 	:	``	he	 know 	 s 	 	just	how	to	give	me	 goose 	 bump 	 s 	 	.	``
 yea 	 h 	 	,	he	 jump 	 s 	 	out	of	 building 	 s 	 	.	it	's	--	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	one	 work 	 s 	 	,	kind	of	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	spread	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 continu 	 ed 	 	through	the	entire	magazine	.
it	did	not	let	up	.
 th 	 is 	 	 say 	 s 	 	:	``	one	clean	 fit 	 s 	 	all	.	``	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	a	lot	of	 orphan 	 s 	 	made	 th 	 is 	 	day	,	and	here	's	a	dead	body	 be 	 ing 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	out	.
it	just	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	possibly	even	a	blank	page	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	more	appropriate	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	one	i	think	is	possibly	the	worst	:	two	 lad 	 ies 	 	,	both	facing	the	same	way	,	both	 wear 	 ing 	 	 jean 	 s 	 	.
one	--	who	 know 	 s 	 	what	she	's	going	through	;	the	other	one	is	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	model	behavior	and	milk	.
and	--	i	 g 	 ave 	 	a	talk	in	new	york	a	couple	 month 	 s 	 	after	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	 some 	 body 	 	came	up	to	me	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	that	--	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	 email 	 ed 	 	me	--	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	that	they	 appreciate 	 d 	 	the	talk	,	and	when	they	got	back	to	 the 	 ir 	 	car	,	they	found	a	note	on	 the 	 ir 	 	car	that	made	them	think	 may 	 be 	 	new	york	was	 get 	 ting 	 	back	to	 be 	 ing 	 	new	york	 aga 	 in 	 	after	 th 	 is 	 	event	--	it	had	 be 	 en 	 	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	what	they	found	on	 the 	 ir 	 	car	.
there	's	 ver 	 y 	 	few	 time 	 s 	 	you	'd	be	happy	to	find	 th 	 is 	 	on	your	car	,	but	it	did	seem	to	 indic 	 ate 	 	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	coming	back	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	my	 desk 	 top 	 	.
 some 	 body 	 	told	me	 to 	 day 	 	there	was	 th 	 is 	 	thing	 call 	 ed 	 	 fold 	 ers 	 	,	but	i	do	n't	know	what	they	are	.
these	are	my	 note 	 s 	 	for	the	talk	--	there	might	be	a	correlation	here	.
we	are	 wrap 	 ping 	 	up	.
 th 	 is 	 	i	saw	on	the	plane	,	 fly 	 ing 	 	in	,	for	hot	new	 product 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 improve 	 ment 	 	,	or	a	good	idea	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	like	,	if	you	do	n't	 s 	 pend 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	time	in	front	of	your	computer	,	you	can	now	get	a	plate	in	the	 key 	 board 	 	,	so	there	's	no	more	 fak 	 ing 	 	it	--	that	you	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 it 	 	at	your	desk	all	day	and	eat	and	work	 any 	 way 	 	.	now	there	's	a	plate	,	and	it	would	be	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	convenient	to	get	a	piece	of	pizza	,	then	type	a	little	bit	,	then	...
i	'm	just	not	 s 	 ure 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	 improve 	 ment 	 	.
if	you	ever	doubt	the	power	of	graphic	design	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	generic	sign	that	 liter 	 ally 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	vote	for	hitler	.	``	it	 say 	 s 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	else	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	to	me	is	an	 extrem 	 e 	 	case	of	the	power	of	emotion	,	of	graphic	design	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	,	in	fact	,	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	generic	 post 	 er 	 	at	the	time	.
what	's	next	?	what	's	next	is	going	to	be	people	.
 a 	 s 	 	we	get	more	 technical 	 ly 	 	driven	,	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	people	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	more	than	it	's	ever	 be 	 en 	 	before	.
you	have	to	 util 	 ize 	 	who	you	are	in	your	work	.
 no 	 body 	 	else	can	do	that	:	 no 	 body 	 	else	can	pull	from	your	 back 	 ground 	 	,	from	your	 parent 	 s 	 	,	your	 up 	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	,	your	whole	life	experience	.
if	you	allow	that	to	happen	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	you	can	do	some	 un 	 ique 	 	work	,	and	you	're	going	to	enjoy	the	work	a	lot	more	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	--	i	like	found	art	;	hand	 letter 	 ing 	 	's	coming	back	in	a	big	way	,	and	i	thought	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	great	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	both	.
 th 	 is 	 	 lad 	 y 	 	's	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	for	her	lost	pit	bull	.
it	's	friendly	--	she	's	 under 	 lined 	 	friendly	--	that	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	why	she	 call 	 s 	 	it	hercules	or	hercles	.	she	ca	n't	spell	.
but	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	she	's	 will 	 ing 	 	to	give	you	20	 buck 	 s 	 	to	go	find	 th 	 is 	 	lost	pit	bull	.
and	i	'm	 think 	 ing 	 	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	right	,	i	'll	go	look	for	a	lost	pit	bill	for	20	 buck 	 s 	 	.
i	have	 vision 	 s 	 	of	people	going	down	 al 	 ley 	 ways 	 	 yell 	 ing 	 	out	for	hercles	,	and	you	get	charged	by	 th 	 is 	 	thing	and	you	go	,	oh	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	be	hercles	;	 pleas 	 e 	 	be	the	friendly	one	.
i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	she	never	found	the	dog	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	took	the	sign	.
but	i	was	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	give	a	talk	at	a	 con 	 ference 	 	in	sacramento	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	back	.
and	the	theme	was	courage	,	and	they	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	to	talk	about	how	 courage 	 ous 	 	it	is	to	be	a	graphic	 design 	 er 	 	.
and	i	 remember 	 ed 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	photograph	of	my	father	,	who	was	a	test	pilot	,	and	he	told	me	that	when	you	 sign 	 ed 	 	up	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	test	pilot	,	they	told	you	that	there	was	a	40	to	50	percent	chance	of	death	on	the	job	.
that	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	high	for	most	 occupation 	 s 	 	.
but	,	you	know	,	the	government	would	make	a	plane	;	they	'd	say	,	go	see	if	that	one	flies	,	would	you	?
some	of	them	did	;	some	of	them	did	n't	.
and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	some	of	these	 decision 	 s 	 	i	have	to	make	between	,	like	,	serif	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	san	-	serif	.
and	for	the	most	part	,	they	're	not	real	life	-	 threaten 	 ing 	 	.
why	not	experiment	?	why	not	have	some	 f 	 un 	 	?
why	not	put	some	of	 your 	 self 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	work	?
and	when	i	was	 teach 	 ing 	 	,	i	used	to	 al 	 ways 	 	ask	the	 student 	 s 	 	,	what	's	the	definition	of	a	good	job	?
and	 a 	 s 	 	 teacher 	 s 	 	,	after	you	get	all	the	 answer 	 s 	 	,	you	like	to	give	them	the	correct	answer	.
and	the	best	one	i	've	heard	--	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	some	of	you	have	heard	 th 	 is 	 	--	the	definition	of	a	good	job	is	:	if	you	could	afford	to	--	if	money	was	n't	an	issue	--	would	you	be	 do 	 ing 	 	that	same	work	?
and	if	you	would	,	you	've	got	a	great	job	.
and	if	you	would	n't	,	what	the	heck	are	you	 do 	 ing 	 	?
you	're	going	to	be	dead	a	 re 	 ally 	 	long	time	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
