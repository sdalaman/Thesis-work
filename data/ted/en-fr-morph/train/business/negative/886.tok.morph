thank	you	so	much	.	i	'm	going	to	try	to	take	you	on	a	journey	of	the	 under 	 water 	 	acoustic	world	of	 whale 	 s 	 	and	 dolphin 	 s 	 	.
since	we	are	 s 	 uch 	 	a	visual	species	,	it	's	hard	for	us	to	 re 	 ally 	 	understand	 th 	 is 	 	,
so	i	'll	use	a	 mix 	 ture 	 	of	 figure 	 s 	 	and	 sound 	 s 	 	and	hope	 th 	 is 	 	can	communicate	it	.
but	let	's	 al 	 so 	 	think	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	visual	species	,	what	it	's	like	when	we	go	 snorkel 	 ing 	 	or	 div 	 ing 	 	and	try	to	look	 under 	 water 	 	.
we	 re 	 ally 	 	ca	n't	see	 ver 	 y 	 	far	.
our	vision	,	which	 work 	 s 	 	so	well	in	air	,	all	of	a	sudden	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 restrict 	 ed 	 	and	 clau 	 stro 	 phobic 	 	.
and	what	marine	 mammal 	 s 	 	have	 evolv 	 ed 	 	over	the	last	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	is	ways	to	depend	on	sound	to	both	explore	 the 	 ir 	 	world	and	 al 	 so 	 	to	stay	in	touch	with	one	 an 	 other 	 	.
 dolphin 	 s 	 	and	 tooth 	 ed 	 	 whale 	 s 	 	use	 echo 	 location 	 	.
they	can	produce	loud	 click 	 s 	 	and	listen	for	 echo 	 es 	 	from	the	sea	floor	in	order	to	orient	.
they	can	listen	for	 echo 	 es 	 	from	 pre 	 y 	 	in	order	to	decide	where	food	is	and	to	decide	which	one	they	want	to	eat	.
all	marine	 mammal 	 s 	 	use	sound	for	communication	to	stay	in	touch	.
so	the	large	 bale 	 en 	 	 whale 	 s 	 	will	produce	long	,	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 song 	 s 	 	,	which	are	used	in	 re 	 productive 	 	 advertise 	 ment 	 	for	male	and	 female 	 s 	 	,	both	to	find	one	 an 	 other 	 	and	to	select	a	mate	.
and	mother	and	young	and	 close 	 ly 	 	 bond 	 ed 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	use	 call 	 s 	 	to	stay	in	touch	with	one	 an 	 other 	 	,
so	sound	is	 re 	 ally 	 	critical	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
the	first	thing	that	got	me	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	 sound 	 s 	 	of	these	 under 	 water 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	,	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	world	was	so	foreign	to	me	,	was	evidence	from	 captiv 	 e 	 	 dolphin 	 s 	 	that	 captiv 	 e 	 	 dolphin 	 s 	 	could	 imit 	 ate 	 	human	 sound 	 s 	 	.
and	i	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	i	'll	use	some	visual	 represent 	 ations 	 	of	 sound 	 s 	 	.
here	's	the	first	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	plot	of	frequency	against	time	--
sort	of	like	musical	 not 	 ation 	 	,	where	the	 high 	 er 	 	 note 	 s 	 	are	up	 high 	 er 	 	and	the	lower	 note 	 s 	 	are	lower	,	and	time	 go 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	of	a	 train 	 er 	 	's	 whistl 	 e 	 	,	a	 whistl 	 e 	 	a	 train 	 er 	 	will	blow	to	tell	a	dolphin	it	's	 d 	 one 	 	the	right	thing	and	can	come	get	a	fish	.
it	 sound 	 s 	 	sort	of	like	``	tweeeeeet	.	``	like	that	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ca 	 lf 	 	in	 captiv 	 ity 	 	making	an	 imit 	 ation 	 	of	that	 train 	 er 	 	's	 whistl 	 e 	 	.
if	you	 hum 	 med 	 	 th 	 is 	 	tune	to	your	dog	or	cat	and	it	 hum 	 med 	 	it	back	to	you	,	you	ought	to	be	 pre 	 tty 	 	 surprise 	 d 	 	.
 ver 	 y 	 	few	 non 	 human 	 	 mammal 	 s 	 	can	 imit 	 ate 	 	 sound 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	for	our	music	and	our	language	.
so	it	's	a	 puzzl 	 e 	 	:	the	few	other	mammal	 group 	 s 	 	that	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	why	do	they	do	it	?
a	lot	of	my	 care 	 er 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 devote 	 d 	 	to	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	how	these	 animal 	 s 	 	use	 the 	 ir 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	,	use	the	ability	to	change	what	you	say	based	on	what	you	hear	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	communication	 system 	 s 	 	.
so	let	's	start	with	 call 	 s 	 	of	a	 non 	 human 	 	 prim 	 ate 	 	.
 man 	 y 	 	 mammal 	 s 	 	have	to	produce	contact	 call 	 s 	 	when	,	say	,	a	mother	and	 ca 	 lf 	 	are	 a 	 part 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	a	call	 produce 	 d 	 	by	squirrel	 monkey 	 s 	 	when	they	're	 isolate 	 d 	 	from	 an 	 other 	 	one	.
and	you	can	see	,	there	's	not	much	 vari 	 ability 	 	in	these	 call 	 s 	 	.
by	contrast	,	the	signature	 whistl 	 e 	 	which	 dolphin 	 s 	 	use	to	stay	in	touch	,	each	individual	here	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 radical 	 ly 	 	different	call	.
they	can	use	 th 	 is 	 	ability	to	learn	 call 	 s 	 	in	order	to	develop	more	 complic 	 ated 	 	and	more	 distinct 	 ive 	 	 call 	 s 	 	to	identify	 individual 	 s 	 	.
how	about	the	setting	in	which	 animal 	 s 	 	need	to	use	 th 	 is 	 	call	?
well	let	's	look	at	 mother 	 s 	 	and	 calve 	 s 	 	.
in	normal	life	for	mother	and	 ca 	 lf 	 	dolphin	,	they	'll	often	drift	 a 	 part 	 	or	swim	 a 	 part 	 	if	mom	is	chasing	a	fish	,
and	when	they	 separat 	 e 	 	they	have	to	get	back	together	 aga 	 in 	 	.
what	 th 	 is 	 	figure	 show 	 s 	 	is	the	 percent 	 age 	 	of	the	 separat 	 ions 	 	in	which	 dolphin 	 s 	 	 whistl 	 e 	 	,	against	the	 maxim 	 um 	 	distance	.
so	when	 dolphin 	 s 	 	are	 separat 	 ing 	 	by	less	than	20	 meter 	 s 	 	,	less	than	half	the	time	they	need	to	use	 whistl 	 es 	 	.
most	of	the	time	they	can	just	find	each	other	just	by	 swimm 	 ing 	 	around	.
but	all	of	the	time	when	they	 separat 	 e 	 	by	more	than	100	 meter 	 s 	 	,	they	need	to	use	these	 individual 	 ly 	 	 distinct 	 ive 	 	 whistl 	 es 	 	to	come	back	together	 aga 	 in 	 	.
most	of	these	 distinct 	 ive 	 	signature	 whistl 	 es 	 	are	 quit 	 e 	 	 stereo 	 type 	 d 	 	and	 s 	 table 	 	through	the	life	of	a	dolphin	.	but	there	are	some	 exception 	 s 	 	.
when	a	male	dolphin	 leav 	 es 	 	mom	,	it	will	often	join	up	with	 an 	 other 	 	male	and	form	an	alliance	,	which	may	last	for	 decade 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	these	two	 animal 	 s 	 	form	a	social	bond	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 distinct 	 ive 	 	 whistl 	 es 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 converg 	 e 	 	and	 be 	 come 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	.
 th 	 is 	 	plot	 show 	 s 	 	two	 member 	 s 	 	of	a	pair	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	at	the	top	here	,	they	share	an	up	-	 s 	 weep 	 	,	like	``	 wo 	 op 	 	,	 wo 	 op 	 	,	 wo 	 op 	 	.	``
they	both	have	that	kind	of	up	-	 s 	 weep 	 	.
 where 	 a 	 s 	 	these	 member 	 s 	 	of	a	pair	go	``	wo	-	ot	,	wo	-	ot	,	wo	-	ot	.	``
and	what	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	is	they	've	used	 th 	 is 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	process	to	develop	a	new	sign	that	 ident 	 ifies 	 	 th 	 is 	 	new	social	group	.
it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	way	that	they	can	form	a	new	 ident 	 ifier 	 	for	the	new	social	group	that	they	've	had	.
let	's	now	take	a	step	back	and	see	what	 th 	 is 	 	 mess 	 age 	 	can	tell	us	about	 protect 	 ing 	 	 dolphin 	 s 	 	from	human	 disturb 	 ance 	 	.
 any 	 body 	 	looking	at	 th 	 is 	 	picture	will	know	 th 	 is 	 	dolphin	is	 surround 	 ed 	 	,	and	 clear 	 ly 	 	his	behavior	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 disrupt 	 ed 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	bad	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
but	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	when	just	a	single	boat	is	 approach 	 ing 	 	a	group	of	 dolphin 	 s 	 	at	a	couple	hundred	 meter 	 s 	 	away	,	the	 dolphin 	 s 	 	will	start	 whistl 	 ing 	 	,	they	'll	change	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	,	they	'll	have	a	more	 cohes 	 ive 	 	group	,	wait	for	the	boat	to	go	by	,	and	then	they	'll	get	back	to	normal	business	.
well	,	in	a	place	like	sarasota	,	florida	,	the	average	 inter 	 val 	 	between	 time 	 s 	 	that	a	boat	is	 pass 	 ing 	 	 with 	 in 	 	a	hundred	 meter 	 s 	 	of	a	dolphin	group	is	six	 minute 	 s 	 	.
so	even	in	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	look	 a 	 s 	 	bad	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	it	's	still	 affect 	 ing 	 	the	amount	of	time	these	 animal 	 s 	 	have	to	do	 the 	 ir 	 	normal	work	.
and	if	we	look	at	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 pr 	 ist 	 ine 	 	environment	like	western	australia	,	lars	bider	 ha 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	work	 compar 	 ing 	 	dolphin	behavior	and	 distribut 	 ion 	 	before	there	 we 	 re 	 	dolphin	-	 watch 	 ing 	 	 boat 	 s 	 	.
when	there	was	one	boat	,	not	much	of	an	impact	.
and	two	 boat 	 s 	 	:	when	the	second	boat	was	 add 	 ed 	 	,	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	was	that	some	of	the	 dolphin 	 s 	 	left	the	area	 complete 	 ly 	 	.
of	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	 stay 	 ed 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 re 	 productive 	 	rate	 decline 	 d 	 	.
so	it	could	have	a	negative	impact	on	the	whole	population	.
when	we	think	of	marine	-	 protect 	 ed 	 	 area 	 s 	 	for	 animal 	 s 	 	like	 dolphin 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	we	have	to	be	 quit 	 e 	 	conscious	about	 activ 	 ities 	 	that	we	thought	 we 	 re 	 	benign	.
we	may	need	to	 regulat 	 e 	 	the	 intens 	 ity 	 	of	 re 	 creation 	 al 	 	 boat 	 ing 	 	and	actual	whale	 watch 	 ing 	 	in	order	to	prevent	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 problem 	 s 	 	.
i	'd	 al 	 so 	 	like	to	point	out	that	sound	 do 	 es 	 	n't	obey	 bound 	 aries 	 	.
so	you	can	draw	a	line	to	try	to	protect	an	area	,	but	chemical	 poll 	 ution 	 	and	noise	 poll 	 ution 	 	will	 continu 	 e 	 	to	move	through	the	area	.
and	i	'd	like	to	 s 	 witch 	 	now	from	 th 	 is 	 	local	,	familiar	,	 coast 	 al 	 	environment	to	a	much	 broad 	 er 	 	world	of	the	 bale 	 en 	 	 whale 	 s 	 	and	the	open	ocean	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	kind	of	map	we	've	all	 be 	 en 	 	looking	at	.
the	world	is	 most 	 ly 	 	blue	.
but	i	'd	 al 	 so 	 	like	to	point	out	that	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	are	much	more	 connect 	 ed 	 	than	we	think	.
notice	how	few	 bar 	 rier 	 s 	 	there	are	to	 move 	 ment 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	all	of	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	land	.
to	me	,	the	most	mind	-	 bend 	 ing 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	the	 interconnect 	 ed 	 ness 	 	of	the	ocean	 come 	 s 	 	from	an	acoustic	experiment	where	 ocean 	 ographer 	 s 	 	took	a	ship	to	the	southern	indian	ocean	,	 deploy 	 ed 	 	an	 under 	 water 	 	 loud 	 speaker 	 	and	 play 	 ed 	 	back	a	sound	.
that	same	sound	 travel 	 ed 	 	to	the	west	,	and	could	be	heard	in	bermuda	,	and	 travel 	 ed 	 	to	the	east	,	and	could	be	heard	in	monterey	--	the	same	sound	.
so	we	live	in	a	world	of	satellite	communication	,	are	used	to	global	communication	,	but	it	's	still	 amaz 	 ing 	 	to	me	.
the	ocean	 ha 	 s 	 	 proper 	 ties 	 	that	allow	low	-	frequency	sound	to	 bas 	 ically 	 	move	 global 	 ly 	 	.
the	acoustic	transit	time	for	each	of	these	 path 	 s 	 	is	about	three	 hour 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 near 	 ly 	 	 half 	 way 	 	around	the	 glob 	 e 	 	.
in	the	early	'70s	,	roger	payne	and	an	ocean	 acoustic 	 ian 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	a	 theoretic 	 al 	 	paper	 point 	 ing 	 	out	that	it	was	possible	that	sound	could	transmit	over	these	large	 area 	 s 	 	,	but	 ver 	 y 	 	few	 biologist 	 s 	 	 believ 	 ed 	 	it	.
it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	we	've	 on 	 ly 	 	known	of	long	-	range	 propag 	 ation 	 	for	a	few	 decade 	 s 	 	,	the	 whale 	 s 	 	 clear 	 ly 	 	have	 evolv 	 ed 	 	,	over	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	a	way	to	exploit	 th 	 is 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 proper 	 ty 	 	of	the	ocean	.
so	blue	 whale 	 s 	 	and	fin	 whale 	 s 	 	produce	 ver 	 y 	 	low	-	frequency	 sound 	 s 	 	that	can	travel	over	 ver 	 y 	 	long	 range 	 s 	 	.
the	top	plot	here	 show 	 s 	 	a	 complic 	 ated 	 	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 call 	 s 	 	that	are	 repeat 	 ed 	 	by	 male 	 s 	 	.
they	form	 song 	 s 	 	,	and	they	appear	to	play	a	role	in	 re 	 production 	 	,	sort	of	like	that	of	song	 bird 	 s 	 	.
down	 be 	 low 	 	here	,	we	see	 call 	 s 	 	made	by	both	 male 	 s 	 	and	 female 	 s 	 	that	 al 	 so 	 	carry	over	 ver 	 y 	 	long	 range 	 s 	 	.
the	 biologist 	 s 	 	 continu 	 ed 	 	to	be	 skeptic 	 al 	 	of	the	long	-	range	communication	issue	well	past	the	'70s	,	 un 	 til 	 	the	end	of	the	cold	war	.
what	 happen 	 ed 	 	was	,	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	cold	war	,	the	u.s.	 nav 	 y 	 	had	a	system	that	was	secret	at	the	time	,	that	they	used	to	track	russian	 sub 	 marine 	 s 	 	.
it	had	deep	 under 	 water 	 	 micro 	 phone 	 s 	 	,	or	 hydro 	 phone 	 s 	 	,	 cable 	 d 	 	to	shore	,	all	wired	back	to	a	central	place	that	could	listen	to	 sound 	 s 	 	over	the	whole	north	atlantic	.
and	after	the	berlin	wall	fell	,	the	 nav 	 y 	 	made	these	 system 	 s 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	to	whale	bio	-	 acoustic 	 ians 	 	to	see	what	they	could	hear	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	plot	from	christopher	clark	who	 track 	 ed 	 	one	individual	blue	whale	 a 	 s 	 	it	 pass 	 ed 	 	by	bermuda	,	went	down	to	the	latitude	of	miami	and	came	back	 aga 	 in 	 	.
it	was	 track 	 ed 	 	for	43	 day 	 s 	 	,	 swimm 	 ing 	 	1,700	 kilometer 	 s 	 	,	or	more	than	1,000	 mile 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 show 	 s 	 	us	both	that	the	 call 	 s 	 	are	 detect 	 able 	 	over	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 mile 	 s 	 	and	that	 whale 	 s 	 	 routine 	 ly 	 	swim	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 mile 	 s 	 	.
they	're	ocean	-	based	and	scale	 animal 	 s 	 	who	are	 commun 	 ic 	 ating 	 	over	much	 long 	 er 	 	 range 	 s 	 	than	we	had	 anticip 	 ated 	 	.
 un 	 like 	 	 fin 	 s 	 	and	 blue 	 s 	 	,	which	 dispers 	 e 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 temper 	 ate 	 	and	 tropic 	 al 	 	 ocean 	 s 	 	,	the	 hump 	 back 	 ed 	 	 whale 	 s 	 	 congreg 	 ate 	 	in	local	 tradition 	 al 	 	 breed 	 ing 	 	 ground 	 s 	 	,
so	they	can	make	a	sound	that	's	a	little	 high 	 er 	 	in	frequency	,	 broad 	 er 	 	-	band	and	more	 complic 	 ated 	 	.
so	you	're	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	the	 complic 	 ated 	 	song	 produce 	 d 	 	by	 hump 	 back 	 s 	 	here	.
 hump 	 back 	 s 	 	,	when	they	develop	the	ability	to	 s 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	song	,	they	're	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	other	 whale 	 s 	 	and	 modify 	 ing 	 	what	they	 s 	 ing 	 	based	on	what	they	're	 hear 	 ing 	 	,	just	like	song	 bird 	 s 	 	or	the	dolphin	 whistl 	 es 	 	i	 de 	 scribed 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	 hump 	 back 	 	song	is	a	form	of	animal	culture	,	just	like	music	for	 human 	 s 	 	would	be	.
i	think	one	of	the	most	 interest 	 ing 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 come 	 s 	 	from	australia	.
 biologist 	 s 	 	on	the	east	coast	of	australia	 we 	 re 	 	 record 	 ing 	 	the	 song 	 s 	 	of	 hump 	 back 	 s 	 	in	that	area	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 o 	 range 	 	line	here	 mark 	 s 	 	the	typical	 song 	 s 	 	of	east	coast	 hump 	 back 	 s 	 	.
in	'95	they	all	 s 	 ang 	 	the	normal	song	.
but	in	'96	they	heard	a	few	weird	 song 	 s 	 	,
and	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	that	these	strange	 song 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	typical	of	west	coast	 whale 	 s 	 	.
the	west	coast	 call 	 s 	 	 be 	 came 	 	more	and	more	popular	,	 un 	 til 	 	by	1998	,	 non 	 e 	 	of	the	 whale 	 s 	 	 s 	 ang 	 	the	east	coast	song	;	it	was	 complete 	 ly 	 	gone	.
they	just	 s 	 ang 	 	the	cool	new	west	coast	song	.
it	's	 a 	 s 	 	if	some	new	hit	style	had	 complete 	 ly 	 	 wipe 	 d 	 	out	the	old	-	 fashion 	 ed 	 	style	before	,	and	with	no	 gold 	 en 	 	 old 	 ies 	 	 station 	 s 	 	.
 no 	 body 	 	 s 	 ang 	 	the	old	 one 	 s 	 	.
i	'd	like	to	 brief 	 ly 	 	just	show	what	the	ocean	 do 	 es 	 	to	these	 call 	 s 	 	.
now	you	are	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	a	 record 	 ing 	 	made	by	chris	clark	,	0.2	 mile 	 s 	 	away	from	a	 hump 	 back 	 	.
you	can	hear	the	full	frequency	range	.	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	loud	.
you	sound	 ver 	 y 	 	 near 	 by 	 	.
the	next	 record 	 ing 	 	you	're	going	to	hear	was	made	of	the	same	 hump 	 back 	 	song	50	 mile 	 s 	 	away	.
that	's	 show 	 n 	 	down	here	.
you	 on 	 ly 	 	hear	the	low	 fr 	 equ 	 encies 	 	.
you	hear	the	 reverbe 	 ration 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	sound	 travel 	 s 	 	over	long	-	range	in	the	ocean	and	is	not	 quit 	 e 	 	 a 	 s 	 	loud	.
now	after	i	play	back	these	 hump 	 back 	 	 call 	 s 	 	,	i	'll	play	blue	whale	 call 	 s 	 	,	but	they	have	to	be	 s 	 ped 	 	up	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	so	low	in	frequency	that	you	would	n't	be	able	to	hear	it	 other 	 wise 	 	.
here	's	a	blue	whale	call	at	50	 mile 	 s 	 	,	which	was	 di 	 stant 	 	for	the	 hump 	 back 	 	.	it	's	loud	,	clear	--	you	can	hear	it	 ver 	 y 	 	 clear 	 ly 	 	.
here	's	the	same	call	 record 	 ed 	 	from	a	 hydro 	 phone 	 	500	 mile 	 s 	 	away	.
there	's	a	lot	of	noise	,	which	is	 most 	 ly 	 	other	 whale 	 s 	 	.
but	you	can	still	hear	that	faint	call	.
let	's	now	 s 	 witch 	 	and	think	about	a	potential	for	human	 impact 	 s 	 	.
the	most	 domin 	 ant 	 	sound	that	 human 	 s 	 	put	 in 	 to 	 	the	ocean	 come 	 s 	 	from	 ship 	 ping 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	sound	of	a	ship	,	and	i	'm	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	talk	a	little	 loud 	 er 	 	to	talk	over	it	.
imagine	that	whale	 listen 	 ing 	 	from	500	 mile 	 s 	 	.
there	's	a	potential	problem	that	 may 	 be 	 	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 ship 	 ping 	 	noise	would	prevent	 whale 	 s 	 	from	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	hear	each	other	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	known	for	 quit 	 e 	 	a	while	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	figure	from	a	 text 	 book 	 	on	 under 	 water 	 	sound	.
and	on	the	y	-	axis	is	the	 loud 	 ness 	 	of	average	 ambi 	 ent 	 	noise	in	the	deep	ocean	by	frequency	.
in	the	low	 fr 	 equ 	 encies 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	line	 indic 	 ates 	 	sound	that	 come 	 s 	 	from	 s 	 e 	 ism 	 ic 	 	activity	of	the	earth	.
up	high	,	these	 vari 	 able 	 	lines	 indic 	 ate 	 	increasing	noise	in	 th 	 is 	 	frequency	range	from	 high 	 er 	 	wind	and	wave	.
but	right	in	the	middle	here	where	there	's	a	sweet	spot	,	the	noise	is	 dominate 	 d 	 	by	human	 ship 	 s 	 	.
now	think	about	it	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	thing	:
that	in	 th 	 is 	 	frequency	range	where	 whale 	 s 	 	communicate	,	the	main	source	 global 	 ly 	 	,	on	our	planet	,	for	the	noise	 come 	 s 	 	from	human	 ship 	 s 	 	,	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	human	 ship 	 s 	 	,	 di 	 stant 	 	,	far	away	,	just	all	 aggreg 	 ating 	 	.
the	next	slide	will	show	what	the	impact	 th 	 is 	 	may	have	on	the	range	at	which	 whale 	 s 	 	can	communicate	.
so	here	we	have	the	 loud 	 ness 	 	of	a	call	at	the	whale	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	we	get	 far 	 ther 	 	away	,	the	sound	 get 	 s 	 	 faint 	 er 	 	and	 faint 	 er 	 	.
now	in	the	pre	-	industrial	ocean	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	 ment 	 ion 	 ing 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	whale	call	could	be	 eas 	 ily 	 	 detect 	 ed 	 	.
it	's	 loud 	 er 	 	than	noise	at	a	range	of	a	thousand	 kilometer 	 s 	 	.
let	's	now	take	that	 add 	 ition 	 al 	 	 in 	 crease 	 	in	noise	that	we	saw	 come 	 s 	 	from	 ship 	 ping 	 	.
all	of	a	sudden	,	the	effective	range	of	communication	 go 	 es 	 	from	a	thousand	 kilometer 	 s 	 	to	10	 kilometer 	 s 	 	.
now	if	 th 	 is 	 	signal	is	used	for	 male 	 s 	 	and	 female 	 s 	 	to	find	each	other	for	 mat 	 ing 	 	and	they	're	 dispers 	 ed 	 	,	imagine	the	impact	 th 	 is 	 	could	have	on	the	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	of	 en 	 danger 	 ed 	 	 population 	 s 	 	.
 whale 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	have	contact	 call 	 s 	 	like	i	 de 	 scribed 	 	for	the	 dolphin 	 s 	 	.
i	'll	play	the	sound	of	a	contact	call	used	by	right	 whale 	 s 	 	to	stay	in	touch	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	kind	of	call	that	is	used	by	,	say	,	right	whale	 mother 	 s 	 	and	 calve 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	 separat 	 e 	 	to	come	back	 aga 	 in 	 	.
now	imagine	--	let	's	put	the	ship	noise	in	the	picture	.
what	's	a	mother	to	do	if	the	ship	 come 	 s 	 	by	and	her	 ca 	 lf 	 	is	n't	there	?
i	'll	 de 	 scribe 	 	a	couple	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	.
one	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	is	if	your	call	's	down	here	,	and	the	noise	is	in	 th 	 is 	 	band	,	you	could	shift	the	frequency	of	your	call	out	of	the	noise	band	and	communicate	better	.
susan	 park 	 s 	 	of	penn	state	 ha 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 stud 	 ied 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
she	's	 look 	 ed 	 	in	the	atlantic	.	here	's	data	from	the	south	atlantic	.
here	's	a	typical	south	atlantic	contact	call	from	the	'70s	.
look	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	by	2000	to	the	average	call	.
same	thing	in	the	north	atlantic	,	in	the	'50s	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	2000	.
over	the	last	50	 year 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	've	put	more	noise	 in 	 to 	 	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	,	these	 whale 	 s 	 	have	had	to	shift	.
it	's	 a 	 s 	 	if	the	whole	population	had	to	shift	from	 be 	 ing 	 	 bas 	 s 	 es 	 	to	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 ten 	 or 	 	.
it	's	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	shift	,	induced	by	 human 	 s 	 	over	 th 	 is 	 	large	scale	,	in	both	time	and	space	.
and	we	now	know	that	 whale 	 s 	 	can	 compens 	 ate 	 	for	noise	by	 call 	 ing 	 	 loud 	 er 	 	,	like	i	did	when	that	ship	was	 play 	 ing 	 	,	by	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	silence	and	by	shifting	 the 	 ir 	 	call	out	of	the	noise	band	.
now	there	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	to	 call 	 ing 	 	 loud 	 er 	 	or	shifting	the	frequency	away	from	where	you	want	to	be	,
and	there	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	lost	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	.
if	we	 al 	 so 	 	have	to	wait	for	silence	,	they	may	 mis 	 s 	 	a	critical	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	communicate	.
so	we	have	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	when	the	noise	in	 habit 	 at 	 s 	 	 de 	 grade 	 s 	 	the	 habit 	 at 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	that	the	 animal 	 s 	 	either	have	to	pay	too	much	to	be	able	to	communicate	,	or	are	not	able	to	perform	critical	 function 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	problem	.
and	i	'm	happy	to	say	that	there	are	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	promising	 develop 	 ments 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	area	,	looking	at	the	impact	of	 ship 	 ping 	 	on	 whale 	 s 	 	.
in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	 ship 	 ping 	 	noise	,	the	 inter 	 national 	 	maritime	 organ 	 ization 	 	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 form 	 ed 	 	a	group	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	job	is	to	establish	 guide 	 lines 	 	for	 quiet 	 ing 	 	 ship 	 s 	 	,	to	tell	the	industry	how	you	could	quiet	 ship 	 s 	 	.
and	they	've	 al 	 ready 	 	found	that	by	 be 	 ing 	 	more	intelligent	about	better	 propel 	 ler 	 	design	,	you	can	 reduc 	 e 	 	that	noise	by	90	percent	.
if	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	insulate	and	isolate	the	 machine 	 ry 	 	of	the	ship	from	the	hull	,	you	can	 reduc 	 e 	 	that	noise	by	99	percent	.
so	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	it	's	 prim 	 arily 	 	an	issue	of	cost	and	 standard 	 s 	 	.
if	 th 	 is 	 	group	can	establish	 standard 	 s 	 	,	and	if	the	 ship 	 building 	 	industry	 adopt 	 s 	 	them	for	building	new	 ship 	 s 	 	,	we	can	now	see	a	 gradu 	 al 	 	decline	in	 th 	 is 	 	potential	problem	.
but	there	's	 al 	 so 	 	 an 	 other 	 	problem	from	 ship 	 s 	 	that	i	'm	 illustr 	 ating 	 	here	,	and	that	's	the	problem	of	collision	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	whale	that	just	 squeak 	 ed 	 	by	a	 rapid 	 ly 	 	moving	 contain 	 er 	 	ship	and	 avoid 	 ed 	 	collision	.
but	collision	is	a	serious	problem	.
 en 	 danger 	 ed 	 	 whale 	 s 	 	are	 kill 	 ed 	 	every	year	by	ship	collision	,
and	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	try	to	 reduc 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	'll	discuss	two	 ver 	 y 	 	promising	 approach 	 es 	 	.
the	first	case	 come 	 s 	 	from	the	 ba 	 y 	 	of	fundy	.	these	black	lines	mark	 ship 	 ping 	 	 lane 	 s 	 	in	and	out	of	the	 ba 	 y 	 	of	fundy	.
the	 color 	 ized 	 	area	 show 	 s 	 	the	risk	of	collision	for	 en 	 danger 	 ed 	 	right	 whale 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 ship 	 s 	 	moving	in	 th 	 is 	 	lane	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	 th 	 is 	 	lane	here	 go 	 es 	 	right	through	a	major	 feed 	 ing 	 	area	of	right	 whale 	 s 	 	in	the	summer	time	,
and	it	 make 	 s 	 	an	area	of	a	significant	risk	of	collision	.
well	,	 biologist 	 s 	 	who	could	n't	take	no	for	an	answer	went	to	the	 inter 	 national 	 	maritime	 organ 	 ization 	 	and	 petition 	 ed 	 	them	to	say	,	``	ca	n't	you	move	that	lane	?	 t 	 hose 	 	are	just	lines	on	the	ground	.
ca	n't	you	move	them	over	to	a	place	where	there	's	less	of	a	risk	?	``
and	the	 inter 	 national 	 	maritime	 organ 	 ization 	 	 respond 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 strong 	 ly 	 	,	``	these	are	the	new	 lane 	 s 	 	.	``	the	 ship 	 ping 	 	 lane 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 move 	 d 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	the	risk	of	collision	is	much	lower	.
so	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	promising	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
we	can	be	 ver 	 y 	 	creative	about	 think 	 ing 	 	of	different	ways	to	 reduc 	 e 	 	these	 risk 	 s 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	action	which	was	just	taken	 in 	 dependent 	 ly 	 	by	a	 ship 	 ping 	 	company	 it 	 self 	 	was	 initi 	 ated 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 concern 	 s 	 	the	 ship 	 ping 	 	company	had	about	 green 	 house 	 	gas	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	with	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	.
the	maersk	line	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 the 	 ir 	 	 com 	 petition 	 	and	saw	that	 every 	 body 	 	who	is	in	 ship 	 ping 	 	 think 	 s 	 	time	is	money	.
they	rush	 a 	 s 	 	fast	 a 	 s 	 	they	can	to	get	to	 the 	 ir 	 	port	.
but	then	they	often	wait	there	.
what	maersk	did	is	they	 work 	 ed 	 	ways	to	 s 	 low 	 	down	.
they	could	 s 	 low 	 	down	by	about	50	percent	.
 th 	 is 	 	 reduc 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	fuel	consumption	by	about	30	percent	,	which	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	them	money	,	and	at	the	same	time	,	it	had	a	significant	benefit	for	 whale 	 s 	 	.
it	you	 s 	 low 	 	down	,	you	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	amount	of	noise	you	make	and	you	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	risk	of	collision	.
so	to	conclude	,	i	'd	just	like	to	point	out	,	you	know	,	the	 whale 	 s 	 	live	in	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	acoustic	environment	.
they	've	 evolv 	 ed 	 	over	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	to	take	advantage	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	we	need	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	attentive	and	 vigil 	 ant 	 	to	 think 	 ing 	 	about	where	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	do	may	 un 	 intentional 	 ly 	 	prevent	them	from	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 activ 	 ities 	 	.
at	the	same	time	,	we	need	to	be	 re 	 ally 	 	creative	in	 think 	 ing 	 	of	 solution 	 s 	 	to	be	able	to	help	 reduc 	 e 	 	these	 problem 	 s 	 	.
i	hope	these	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	have	 show 	 n 	 	some	of	the	different	 direction 	 s 	 	we	can	take	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	 protect 	 ed 	 	 area 	 s 	 
to	be	able	to	keep	the	ocean	safe	for	 whale 	 s 	 	to	be	able	to	 continu 	 e 	 	to	communicate	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
