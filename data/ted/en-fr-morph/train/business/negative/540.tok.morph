 aid 	 s 	 	was	 discover 	 ed 	 	1981	;	the	virus	,	1983	.
these	gapminder	 bubble 	 s 	 	show	you	how	the	spread	of	the	virus	was	in	1983	in	the	world	,	or	how	we	estimate	that	it	was	.
what	we	are	 show 	 ing 	 	here	is	--	on	 th 	 is 	 	axis	here	,	i	'm	 show 	 ing 	 	percent	of	 infect 	 ed 	 	 adult 	 s 	 	.
and	on	 th 	 is 	 	axis	,	i	'm	 show 	 ing 	 	 dollar 	 s 	 	per	person	in	income	.
and	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	these	 bubble 	 s 	 	,	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	 bubble 	 s 	 	here	,	that	 show 	 s 	 	how	 man 	 y 	 	are	 infect 	 ed 	 	in	each	country	,	and	the	color	is	the	continent	.
now	,	you	can	see	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	in	1983	,	had	a	 ver 	 y 	 	low	 percent 	 age 	 	 infect 	 ed 	 	,	but	due	to	the	big	population	,	still	a	 s 	 izable 	 	bubble	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	 infect 	 ed 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
and	,	up	there	,	you	see	uganda	.
they	had	 al 	 most 	 	five	percent	 infect 	 ed 	 	,	and	 quit 	 e 	 	a	big	bubble	in	spite	of	 be 	 ing 	 	a	small	country	,	then	.
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	most	 infect 	 ed 	 	country	in	the	world	.
now	,	what	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	?
now	you	have	 under 	 stood 	 	the	graph	and	now	,	in	the	next	60	 second 	 s 	 	,	we	will	play	the	hiv	 epi 	 demic 	 	in	the	world	.
but	first	,	i	have	a	new	 invent 	 ion 	 	here	.
i	have	 solid 	 ified 	 	the	beam	of	the	laser	 point 	 er 	 	.
so	,	ready	,	 stead 	 y 	 	,	go	!
first	,	we	have	the	fast	rise	in	uganda	and	zimbabwe	.
they	went	 up 	 ward 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
in	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	,	the	first	country	to	be	 heav 	 ily 	 	 infect 	 ed 	 	was	thailand	--
they	 reach 	 ed 	 	one	to	two	percent	.
then	,	uganda	 start 	 ed 	 	to	turn	back	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	zimbabwe	 skyrocket 	 ed 	 	,	and	some	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	south	africa	had	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	rise	of	hiv	frequency	.
look	,	india	got	 man 	 y 	 	 infect 	 ed 	 	,	but	had	a	low	level	.
and	 al 	 most 	 	the	same	 happen 	 s 	 	here	.
see	,	uganda	coming	down	,	zimbabwe	coming	down	,	russia	went	to	one	percent	.
in	the	last	two	to	three	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	have	 reach 	 ed 	 	a	 stead 	 y 	 	state	of	hiv	 epi 	 demic 	 	in	the	world	.
25	 year 	 s 	 	it	took	.
but	,	 stead 	 y 	 	state	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	that	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 get 	 ting 	 	better	,	it	's	just	that	they	have	 stop 	 ped 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 wo 	 rse 	 	.
and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	--	the	 stead 	 y 	 	state	is	,	more	or	less	,	one	percent	of	the	adult	world	population	is	hiv	-	 infect 	 ed 	 	.
it	 mean 	 s 	 	30	to	40	million	people	,	the	whole	of	california	--	every	person	,	that	's	more	or	less	what	we	have	 to 	 day 	 	in	the	world	.
now	,	let	me	make	a	fast	 re 	 play 	 	of	botswana	.
botswana	--	upper	middle	-	income	country	in	southern	africa	,	 democrat 	 ic 	 	government	,	good	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	there	.
they	 start 	 ed 	 	low	,	they	 skyrocket 	 ed 	 	,	they	 peak 	 ed 	 	up	there	in	2003	,	and	now	they	are	down	.
but	they	are	 fall 	 ing 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	in	botswana	,	with	good	 eco 	 nomy 	 	and	 govern 	 ance 	 	,	they	can	manage	to	treat	people	.
and	if	people	who	are	 infect 	 ed 	 	are	 treat 	 ed 	 	,	they	do	n't	die	of	 aid 	 s 	 	.
these	 percent 	 age 	 s 	 	wo	n't	come	down	 be 	 cause 	 	people	can	 surviv 	 e 	 	10	to	20	 year 	 s 	 	.
so	there	's	some	problem	with	these	 metric 	 s 	 	now	.
but	the	 poor 	 er 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	in	africa	,	the	low	-	income	 count 	 ries 	 	down	here	,	there	the	rates	fall	 fast 	 er 	 	,	of	the	 percent 	 age 	 	 infect 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	people	still	die	.
in	spite	of	pepfar	,	the	 gen 	 er 	 ous 	 	pepfar	,	all	people	are	not	 reach 	 ed 	 	by	 treat 	 ment 	 	,	and	of	 t 	 hose 	 	who	are	 reach 	 ed 	 	by	 treat 	 ment 	 	in	the	poor	 count 	 ries 	 	,	 on 	 ly 	 	60	percent	are	left	on	 treat 	 ment 	 	after	two	 year 	 s 	 	.
it	's	not	realistic	with	 life 	 long 	 	 treat 	 ment 	 	for	 every 	 one 	 	in	the	 poor 	 est 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	.
but	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	good	that	what	is	 d 	 one 	 	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	.
but	focus	now	is	back	on	 prevent 	 ion 	 	.
it	is	 on 	 ly 	 	by	 stop 	 ping 	 	the	 trans 	 mission 	 	that	the	world	will	be	able	to	deal	with	it	.	 drug 	 s 	 	is	too	 cost 	 ly 	 	--	had	we	had	the	 vaccin 	 e 	 	,	or	when	we	will	get	the	 vaccin 	 e 	 	,	that	's	 some 	 thing 	 	more	effective	--	but	the	 drug 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 cost 	 ly 	 	for	the	poor	.
not	the	drug	in	 it 	 self 	 	,	but	the	 treat 	 ment 	 	and	the	care	which	is	 need 	 ed 	 	around	it	.
so	,	when	we	look	at	the	pattern	,	one	thing	 come 	 s 	 	out	 ver 	 y 	 	 clear 	 ly 	 	:	you	see	the	blue	 bubble 	 s 	 	and	people	say	hiv	is	 ver 	 y 	 	high	in	africa	.
i	would	say	,	hiv	is	 ver 	 y 	 	different	in	africa	.
you	'll	find	the	highest	hiv	rate	in	the	world	in	african	 count 	 ries 	 	,	and	yet	you	'll	find	senegal	,	down	here	--	the	same	rate	 a 	 s 	 	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
and	you	'll	find	madagascar	,	and	you	'll	find	a	lot	of	african	 count 	 ries 	 	about	 a 	 s 	 	low	 a 	 s 	 	the	rest	of	the	world	.
it	's	 th 	 is 	 	 terr 	 ible 	 	 simpl 	 ification 	 	that	there	's	one	africa	and	 thing 	 s 	 	go	on	in	one	way	in	africa	.
we	have	to	stop	that	.
it	's	not	 respect 	 ful 	 	,	and	it	's	not	 ver 	 y 	 	clever	to	think	that	way	.
i	had	the	fortune	to	live	and	work	for	a	time	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
i	found	out	that	salt	lake	city	and	san	francisco	 we 	 re 	 	different	.
and	so	it	is	in	africa	--	it	's	a	lot	of	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
so	,	why	is	it	so	high	?	is	it	war	?
no	,	it	's	not	.	look	here	.
war	-	torn	congo	is	down	there	--	two	,	three	,	four	percent	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 peace 	 ful 	 	zambia	,	 neighbor 	 ing 	 	country	--	15	percent	.
and	there	's	good	 stud 	 ies 	 	of	the	 refuge 	 es 	 	coming	out	of	congo	--	they	have	two	,	three	percent	 infect 	 ed 	 	,	and	 peace 	 ful 	 	zambia	--	much	 high 	 er 	 	.
there	are	now	 stud 	 ies 	 	 clear 	 ly 	 	 show 	 ing 	 	that	the	 war 	 s 	 	are	 terr 	 ible 	 	,	that	 rape 	 s 	 	are	 terr 	 ible 	 	,
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	the	 driv 	 ing 	 	force	for	the	high	 level 	 s 	 	in	africa	.
so	,	is	it	poverty	?
well	if	you	look	at	the	macro	level	,	it	 seem 	 s 	 	more	money	,	more	hiv	.
but	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 simpl 	 istic 	 	,	so	let	's	go	down	and	look	at	tanzania	.
i	will	split	tanzania	in	five	income	 group 	 s 	 	,	from	the	highest	income	to	the	 low 	 est 	 	income	,	and	here	we	go	.
the	 one 	 s 	 	with	the	highest	income	,	the	better	off	--	i	would	n't	say	rich	--	they	have	 high 	 er 	 	hiv	.
the	 differ 	 ence 	 	 go 	 es 	 	from	11	percent	down	to	four	percent	,	and	it	is	even	 big 	 ger 	 	among	women	.
there	's	a	lot	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	thought	,	that	now	,	good	research	,	 d 	 one 	 	by	african	 institution 	 s 	 	and	 research 	 ers 	 	together	with	the	 inter 	 national 	 	 research 	 ers 	 	,	show	that	that	's	not	the	case	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	 with 	 in 	 	tanzania	.
and	,	i	ca	n't	avoid	 show 	 ing 	 	kenya	.
look	here	at	kenya	.
i	've	split	kenya	in	 it 	 s 	 	 pro 	 vince 	 s 	 	.
here	it	 go 	 es 	 	.
see	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	 with 	 in 	 	one	african	country	--	it	 go 	 es 	 	from	 ver 	 y 	 	low	level	to	 ver 	 y 	 	high	level	,	and	most	of	the	 pro 	 vince 	 s 	 	in	kenya	is	 quit 	 e 	 	modest	.
so	,	what	is	it	then	?
why	do	we	see	 th 	 is 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	high	 level 	 s 	 	in	some	 count 	 ries 	 	?
well	,	it	is	more	common	with	 multi 	 ple 	 	 partner 	 s 	 	,	there	is	less	condom	use	,	and	there	is	age	-	disparate	 s 	 ex 	 	--	that	is	,	 old 	 er 	 	men	tend	to	have	 s 	 ex 	 	with	 young 	 er 	 	women	.
we	see	 high 	 er 	 	rates	in	 young 	 er 	 	women	than	 young 	 er 	 	men	in	 man 	 y 	 	of	these	 high 	 ly 	 	 affect 	 ed 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	.
but	where	are	they	 situ 	 ated 	 	?
i	will	swap	the	 bubble 	 s 	 	to	a	map	.
look	,	the	 high 	 ly 	 	 infect 	 ed 	 	are	four	percent	of	all	population	and	they	hold	50	percent	of	the	hiv	-	 infect 	 ed 	 	.
hiv	 exist 	 s 	 	all	over	the	world	.
look	,	you	have	 bubble 	 s 	 	all	over	the	world	here	.
brazil	 ha 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	hiv	-	 infect 	 ed 	 	.
arab	 count 	 ries 	 	not	so	much	,	but	iran	is	 quit 	 e 	 	high	.
they	have	 hero 	 in 	 	 addict 	 ion 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	 pro 	 stit 	 ution 	 	in	iran	.
india	 ha 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	 man 	 y 	 	.
 south 	 east 	 	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	,	and	so	on	.
but	,	there	is	one	part	of	africa	--	and	the	difficult	thing	is	,	at	the	same	time	,	not	to	make	a	uniform	 state 	 ment 	 	about	africa	,	not	to	come	to	simple	 idea 	 s 	 	of	why	it	is	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	on	one	hand	.	on	the	other	hand	,	try	to	say	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	the	case	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	is	a	scientific	 con 	 sens 	 us 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	pattern	now	.
unaids	have	 d 	 one 	 	good	data	 avail 	 able 	 	,	 final 	 ly 	 	,	about	the	spread	of	hiv	.
it	could	be	 con 	 curr 	 ency 	 	.
it	could	be	some	virus	 type 	 s 	 	.
it	could	be	that	there	is	other	 thing 	 s 	 	which	 make 	 s 	 	 trans 	 mission 	 	occur	in	a	 high 	 er 	 	frequency	.
after	all	,	if	you	are	 complete 	 ly 	 	 health 	 y 	 	and	you	have	 hetero 	 sexual 	 	 s 	 ex 	 	,	the	risk	of	 infect 	 ion 	 	in	one	 inter 	 course 	 	is	one	in	1,000	.
do	n't	jump	to	 con 	 clusion 	 s 	 	now	on	how	to	 behav 	 e 	 	 to 	 night 	 	and	so	on	.
but	--	and	if	you	are	in	an	 un 	 favor 	 able 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	more	 sexual 	 ly 	 	 transmit 	 ted 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	,	it	can	be	one	in	100	.
but	what	we	think	is	that	it	could	be	 con 	 curr 	 ency 	 	.
and	what	is	 con 	 curr 	 ency 	 	?
in	sweden	,	we	have	no	 con 	 curr 	 ency 	 	.
we	have	 s 	 erial 	 	 mono 	 gam 	 y 	 	.
vodka	,	new	year	's	eve	--	new	partner	for	the	spring	.
vodka	,	midsummer	's	eve	--	new	partner	for	the	fall	.
vodka	--	and	it	 go 	 es 	 	on	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	know	?
and	you	collect	a	big	number	of	 ex 	 es 	 	.
and	we	have	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	chlamydia	 epi 	 demic 	 	--	 terr 	 ible 	 	chlamydia	 epi 	 demic 	 	which	 stick 	 s 	 	around	for	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	.
hiv	 ha 	 s 	 	a	peak	three	to	six	 week 	 s 	 	after	 infect 	 ion 	 	and	 there 	 fore 	 	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	more	than	one	partner	in	the	same	month	is	much	more	 danger 	 ous 	 	for	hiv	than	 other 	 s 	 	.
 prob 	 ably 	 	,	it	's	a	combination	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	what	 make 	 s 	 	me	so	happy	is	that	we	are	moving	now	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	fact	when	we	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	.
you	can	get	 th 	 is 	 	chart	,	free	.
we	have	 upload 	 ed 	 	unaids	data	on	the	gapminder	 s 	 ite 	 	.
and	we	hope	that	when	we	act	on	global	 problem 	 s 	 	in	the	future	we	will	not	 on 	 ly 	 	have	the	heart	,	we	will	not	 on 	 ly 	 	have	the	money	,	but	we	will	 al 	 so 	 	use	the	brain	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
