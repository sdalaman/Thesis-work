on	the	30th	of	may	,	1832	,	a	 gun 	 shot 	 	was	heard	 ring 	 ing 	 	out	 a 	 cross 	 	the	13th	 arrondiss 	 ement 	 	in	paris	.
a	peasant	,	who	was	 walk 	 ing 	 	to	market	that	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	ran	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	where	the	 gun 	 shot 	 	had	come	from	,	and	found	a	young	man	 writ 	 h 	 ing 	 	in	 agon 	 y 	 	on	the	floor	,	 clear 	 ly 	 	shot	by	a	 due 	 ling 	 	wound	.
the	young	man	's	name	was	evariste	galois	.
he	was	a	well	-	known	 revolution 	 ary 	 	in	paris	at	the	time	.
galois	was	taken	to	the	local	hospital	where	he	 di 	 ed 	 	the	next	day	in	the	 arm 	 s 	 	of	his	brother	.
and	the	last	 word 	 s 	 	he	 s 	 aid 	 	to	his	brother	 we 	 re 	 	,	``	do	n't	cry	for	me	,	alfred	.	i	need	all	the	courage	i	can	 must 	 er 	 	to	die	at	the	age	of	20.	``
it	was	n't	,	in	fact	,	 revolution 	 ary 	 	 politic 	 s 	 	for	which	galois	was	famous	.
but	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	,	while	still	at	school	,	he	'd	 actual 	 ly 	 	 crack 	 ed 	 	one	of	the	big	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	at	the	time	.
and	he	wrote	to	the	 academic 	 ians 	 	in	paris	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	explain	his	 theor 	 y 	 	.
but	the	 academic 	 ians 	 	could	n't	understand	 any 	 thing 	 	that	he	wrote	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	how	he	wrote	most	of	his	 mathematic 	 s 	 	.
so	,	the	night	before	that	 d 	 uel 	 	,	he	 real 	 ized 	 	 th 	 is 	 	possibly	is	his	last	chance	to	try	and	explain	his	great	 break 	 through 	 	.
so	he	 stay 	 ed 	 	up	the	whole	night	,	writing	away	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	explain	his	 idea 	 s 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	the	dawn	came	up	and	he	went	to	meet	his	 de 	 s 	 tin 	 y 	 	,	he	left	 th 	 is 	 	pile	of	 paper 	 s 	 	on	the	table	for	the	next	generation	.
 may 	 be 	 	the	fact	that	he	 stay 	 ed 	 	up	all	night	 do 	 ing 	 	 mathematic 	 s 	 	was	the	fact	that	he	was	 s 	 uch 	 	a	bad	shot	that	 morn 	 ing 	 	and	got	 kill 	 ed 	 	.
but	 contain 	 ed 	 	 in 	 side 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 document 	 s 	 	was	a	new	language	,	a	language	to	understand	one	of	the	most	fundamental	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	of	science	--	 name 	 ly 	 	symmetry	.
now	,	symmetry	is	 al 	 most 	 	nature	's	language	.
it	 help 	 s 	 	us	to	understand	so	 man 	 y 	 	different	bits	of	the	scientific	world	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 mole 	 cular 	 	structure	.	what	 crystal 	 s 	 	are	possible	,	we	can	understand	through	the	 mathematic 	 s 	 	of	symmetry	.
in	 micro 	 biology 	 	you	 re 	 ally 	 	do	n't	want	to	get	a	 symmetric 	 al 	 	object	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	 general 	 ly 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	nasty	.
the	 s 	 wine 	 	flu	virus	,	at	the	moment	,	is	a	 symmetric 	 al 	 	object	.
and	it	uses	the	efficiency	of	symmetry	to	be	able	to	 propag 	 ate 	 	 it 	 self 	 	so	well	.
but	on	a	 large 	 r 	 	scale	of	biology	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	symmetry	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 communicate 	 s 	 	genetic	information	.
i	've	taken	two	 picture 	 s 	 	here	and	i	've	made	them	 artificial 	 ly 	 	 symmetric 	 al 	 	.
and	if	i	ask	you	which	of	these	you	find	more	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	you	're	 prob 	 ably 	 	drawn	to	the	lower	two	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	hard	to	make	symmetry	.	and	if	you	can	make	 your 	 self 	 	 symmetric 	 al 	 	,	you	're	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	out	a	sign	that	you	've	got	good	 gene 	 s 	 	,	you	've	got	a	good	 up 	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	and	 there 	 fore 	 	you	'll	make	a	good	mate	.
so	symmetry	is	a	language	which	can	help	to	communicate	genetic	information	.
symmetry	can	 al 	 so 	 	help	us	to	explain	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	the	large	hadron	collider	in	cern	.	or	what	's	not	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	the	large	hadron	collider	in	cern	.	to	be	able	to	make	 predict 	 ions 	 	about	the	fundamental	 particle 	 s 	 	we	might	see	there	,
it	 seem 	 s 	 	that	they	are	all	 facet 	 s 	 	of	some	strange	 symmetric 	 al 	 	shape	in	a	 high 	 er 	 	dimensional	space	.
and	i	think	galileo	 summ 	 ed 	 	up	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 nice 	 ly 	 	,	the	power	of	 mathematic 	 s 	 	to	understand	the	scientific	world	around	us	.
he	wrote	,	``	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	can	not	be	read	 un 	 til 	 	we	have	 learn 	 t 	 	the	language	and	 be 	 come 	 	familiar	with	the	 character 	 s 	 	in	which	it	is	written	.
it	is	written	in	 mathematic 	 al 	 	language	,
and	the	 letter 	 s 	 	are	 triangle 	 s 	 	,	 circle 	 s 	 	and	other	 geo 	 metric 	 	 figure 	 s 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	which	 mean 	 s 	 	it	is	 human 	 ly 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	to	 com 	 prehend 	 	a	single	word	.	``
but	it	's	not	just	 scientist 	 s 	 	who	are	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	symmetry	.
 artist 	 s 	 	too	love	to	play	around	with	symmetry	.
they	 al 	 so 	 	have	a	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	more	 ambigu 	 ous 	 	relationship	with	it	.
here	is	thomas	mann	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	symmetry	in	``	the	magic	mountain	.	``
he	 ha 	 s 	 	a	character	 de 	 s 	 crib 	 ing 	 	the	 snow 	 flake 	 	,
and	he	 say 	 s 	 	he	``	 shudder 	 ed 	 	at	 it 	 s 	 	perfect	 pre 	 cis 	 ion 	 	,	found	it	 death 	 ly 	 	,	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 mar 	 row 	 	of	death	.	``
but	what	 artist 	 s 	 	like	to	do	is	to	set	up	 expect 	 ations 	 	of	symmetry	and	then	break	them	.
and	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	i	found	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	when	i	 visit 	 ed 	 	a	 col 	 league 	 	of	mine	in	japan	,	professor	kurokawa	.
and	he	took	me	up	to	the	 temple 	 s 	 	in	nikko	.
and	just	after	 th 	 is 	 	photo	was	taken	we	 walk 	 ed 	 	up	the	 stair 	 s 	 	.
and	the	 gate 	 way 	 	you	see	 be 	 hind 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	eight	 column 	 s 	 	,	with	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 symmetric 	 al 	 	 design 	 s 	 	on	them	.
seven	of	them	are	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	,	and	the	eighth	one	is	 turn 	 ed 	 	 up 	 side 	 	down	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	to	professor	kurokawa	,	``	 w 	 ow 	 	,	the	 architect 	 s 	 	must	have	 re 	 ally 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 kick 	 ing 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	when	they	 real 	 ized 	 	that	they	'd	made	a	 mistak 	 e 	 	and	put	 th 	 is 	 	one	 up 	 side 	 	down	.	``
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	no	,	no	.	it	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 de 	 liberate 	 	act	.	``
and	he	 refer 	 red 	 	me	to	 th 	 is 	 	 love 	 ly 	 	quote	from	the	japanese	``	 essay 	 s 	 	in	idleness	``	from	the	14th	century	,
in	which	the	 essay 	 ist 	 	wrote	,	``	in	 every 	 thing 	 	,	 uniform 	 ity 	 	is	 un 	 desir 	 able 	 	.
 leav 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 in 	 complete 	 	 make 	 s 	 	it	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	and	 give 	 s 	 	one	the	 feel 	 ing 	 	that	there	is	room	for	growth	.	``
even	when	building	the	imperial	 pa 	 lace 	 	,	they	 al 	 ways 	 	 leav 	 e 	 	one	place	 un 	 finish 	 ed 	 	.
but	if	i	had	to	 choos 	 e 	 	one	building	in	the	world	to	be	cast	out	on	a	desert	 is 	 land 	 	,	to	live	the	rest	of	my	life	,	 be 	 ing 	 	an	addict	of	symmetry	,	i	would	 prob 	 ably 	 	 choos 	 e 	 	the	alhambra	in	granada	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 pa 	 lace 	 	 celebr 	 ating 	 	symmetry	.
 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	i	took	my	family	--
we	do	these	 ra 	 ther 	 	kind	of	 nerd 	 y 	 	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 trip 	 s 	 	,	which	my	family	love	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	my	son	tamer	.	you	can	see	he	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 enjoy 	 ing 	 	our	 mathematic 	 al 	 	trip	to	the	alhambra	.
but	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	try	and	enrich	him	.
i	think	one	of	the	 problem 	 s 	 	about	school	 mathematic 	 s 	 	is	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	look	at	how	 mathematic 	 s 	 	is	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	in	the	world	we	live	in	.
so	,	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	open	his	 eye 	 s 	 	up	to	how	much	symmetry	is	running	through	the	alhambra	.
you	see	it	 al 	 ready 	 	.	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	you	go	in	,	the	 reflect 	 ive 	 	symmetry	in	the	water	.
but	it	's	on	the	 wall 	 s 	 	where	all	the	 excit 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
the	moorish	 artist 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 deni 	 ed 	 	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	to	draw	 thing 	 s 	 	with	 soul 	 s 	 	.
so	they	 explore 	 d 	 	a	more	 geo 	 metric 	 	art	.
and	so	what	is	symmetry	?
the	alhambra	 some 	 how 	 	 ask 	 s 	 	all	of	these	 question 	 s 	 	.
what	is	symmetry	?	when	[	there	]	are	two	of	these	 wall 	 s 	 	,	do	they	have	the	same	 sym 	 me 	 tries 	 	?
can	we	say	 whet 	 her 	 	they	 discover 	 ed 	 	all	of	the	 sym 	 me 	 tries 	 	in	the	alhambra	?
and	it	was	galois	who	 produce 	 d 	 	a	language	to	be	able	to	answer	some	of	these	 question 	 s 	 	.
for	galois	,	symmetry	--	 un 	 like 	 	for	thomas	mann	,	which	was	 some 	 thing 	 	still	and	 death 	 ly 	 	--	for	galois	,	symmetry	was	all	about	motion	.
what	can	you	do	to	a	 symmetric 	 al 	 	object	,
move	it	in	some	way	,	so	it	 look 	 s 	 	the	same	 a 	 s 	 	before	you	 move 	 d 	 	it	?
i	like	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	the	magic	trick	 move 	 s 	 	.
what	can	you	do	to	 some 	 thing 	 	?	you	close	your	 eye 	 s 	 	.
i	do	 some 	 thing 	 	,	put	it	back	down	 aga 	 in 	 	.
it	 look 	 s 	 	like	it	did	before	it	 start 	 ed 	 	.
so	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	the	 wall 	 s 	 	in	the	alhambra	--
i	can	take	all	of	these	 tile 	 s 	 	,	and	fix	them	at	the	yellow	place	,	 rot 	 ate 	 	them	by	90	 degree 	 s 	 	,	put	them	all	back	down	 aga 	 in 	 	and	they	fit	 perfect 	 ly 	 	down	there	.
and	if	you	open	your	 eye 	 s 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	,	you	would	n't	know	that	they	'd	 move 	 d 	 	.
but	it	's	the	motion	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 character 	 ize 	 s 	 	the	symmetry	 in 	 side 	 	the	alhambra	.
but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	about	producing	a	language	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	the	power	of	 mathematic 	 s 	 	is	often	to	change	one	thing	 in 	 to 	 	 an 	 other 	 	,	to	change	 geo 	 metry 	 	 in 	 to 	 	language	.
so	i	'm	going	to	take	you	through	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	push	you	a	little	bit	 mathematic 	 ally 	 	--	so	brace	 your 	 s 	 elves 	 	--
push	you	a	little	bit	to	understand	how	 th 	 is 	 	language	 work 	 s 	 	,	which	 en 	 able 	 s 	 	us	to	capture	what	is	symmetry	.
so	,	let	's	take	these	two	 symmetric 	 al 	 	 object 	 s 	 	here	.
let	's	take	the	 twist 	 ed 	 	six	-	 point 	 ed 	 	 star 	 fish 	 	.
what	can	i	do	to	the	 star 	 fish 	 	which	 make 	 s 	 	it	look	the	same	?
well	,	there	i	 rot 	 ated 	 	it	by	a	sixth	of	a	turn	,	and	still	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	it	did	before	i	 start 	 ed 	 	.
i	could	 rot 	 ate 	 	it	by	a	third	of	a	turn	,	or	a	half	a	turn	,	or	put	it	back	down	on	 it 	 s 	 	image	,	or	two	 third 	 s 	 	of	a	turn	.
and	a	fifth	symmetry	,	i	can	 rot 	 ate 	 	it	by	five	 sixth 	 s 	 	of	a	turn	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	are	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	can	do	to	the	 symmetric 	 al 	 	object	that	make	it	look	like	it	did	before	i	 start 	 ed 	 	.
now	,	for	galois	,	there	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	sixth	symmetry	.
can	 any 	 body 	 	think	what	else	i	could	do	to	 th 	 is 	 	which	would	 leav 	 e 	 	it	like	i	did	before	i	 start 	 ed 	 	?
i	ca	n't	flip	it	 be 	 cause 	 	i	've	put	a	little	twist	on	it	,	have	n't	i	?
it	's	got	no	 reflect 	 ive 	 	symmetry	.
but	what	i	could	do	is	just	 leav 	 e 	 	it	where	it	is	,	pick	it	up	,	and	put	it	down	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	for	galois	 th 	 is 	 	was	like	the	 zero 	 th 	 	symmetry	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	the	 invent 	 ion 	 	of	the	number	zero	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	modern	 con 	 cept 	 	,	 seven 	 th 	 	century	a.d.	,	by	the	 in 	 d 	 ians 	 	.
it	 seem 	 s 	 	mad	to	talk	about	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	same	idea	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 symmetric 	 al 	 	--
so	 every 	 thing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	symmetry	,	where	you	just	 leav 	 e 	 	it	where	it	is	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	object	 ha 	 s 	 	six	 sym 	 me 	 tries 	 	.
and	what	about	the	triangle	?
well	,	i	can	 rot 	 ate 	 	by	a	third	of	a	turn	 clock 	 wise 	 	or	a	third	of	a	turn	 anti 	 clock 	 wise 	 	.
but	now	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	some	 reflect 	 ional 	 	symmetry	.
i	can	reflect	it	in	the	line	through	x	,	or	the	line	through	y	,	or	the	line	through	z	.
five	 sym 	 me 	 tries 	 	and	then	of	course	the	 zero 	 th 	 	symmetry	where	i	just	pick	it	up	and	 leav 	 e 	 	it	where	it	is	.
so	both	of	these	 object 	 s 	 	have	six	 sym 	 me 	 tries 	 	.
now	,	i	'm	a	great	 believ 	 er 	 	that	 mathematic 	 s 	 	is	not	a	 spect 	 ator 	 	 s 	 port 	 	,	and	you	have	to	do	some	 mathematic 	 s 	 	in	order	to	 re 	 ally 	 	understand	it	.
so	here	is	a	little	question	for	you	.
and	i	'm	going	to	give	a	prize	at	the	end	of	my	talk	for	the	person	who	 get 	 s 	 	 close 	 st 	 	to	the	answer	.
the	rubik	's	cube	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	 sym 	 me 	 tries 	 	 do 	 es 	 	a	rubik	's	cube	have	?
how	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	can	i	do	to	 th 	 is 	 	object	and	put	it	down	so	it	still	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	cube	?
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?	so	i	want	you	to	think	about	that	problem	 a 	 s 	 	we	go	on	,	and	count	how	 man 	 y 	 	 sym 	 me 	 tries 	 	there	are	.
and	there	will	be	a	prize	for	the	person	who	 get 	 s 	 	 close 	 st 	 	at	the	end	.
but	let	's	go	back	down	to	 sym 	 me 	 tries 	 	that	i	got	for	these	two	 object 	 s 	 	.
what	galois	 real 	 ized 	 	:	it	is	n't	just	the	individual	 sym 	 me 	 tries 	 	,	but	how	they	interact	with	each	other	which	 re 	 ally 	 	 character 	 ize 	 s 	 	the	symmetry	of	an	object	.
if	i	do	one	magic	trick	move	 follow 	 ed 	 	by	 an 	 other 	 	,	the	combination	is	a	third	magic	trick	move	.
and	here	we	see	galois	 start 	 ing 	 	to	develop	a	language	to	see	the	 sub 	 stance 	 	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	 un 	 s 	 een 	 	,	the	sort	of	abstract	idea	of	the	symmetry	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	physical	object	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	what	if	i	turn	the	 star 	 fish 	 	by	a	sixth	of	a	turn	,	and	then	a	third	of	a	turn	?
so	i	've	 give 	 n 	 	 name 	 s 	 	.	the	capital	 letter 	 s 	 	,	a	,	b	,	c	,	d	,	e	,	f	,	are	the	 name 	 s 	 	for	the	 rot 	 ations 	 	.
b	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 rot 	 ates 	 	the	little	yellow	dot	to	the	b	on	the	 star 	 fish 	 	.	and	so	on	.
so	what	if	i	do	b	,	which	is	a	sixth	of	a	turn	,	 follow 	 ed 	 	by	c	,	which	is	a	third	of	a	turn	?
well	let	's	do	that	.	a	sixth	of	a	turn	,	 follow 	 ed 	 	by	a	third	of	a	turn	,	the	 combine 	 d 	 	effect	is	 a 	 s 	 	if	i	had	just	 rot 	 ated 	 	it	by	half	a	turn	in	one	go	.
so	the	little	table	here	 record 	 s 	 	how	the	algebra	of	these	 sym 	 me 	 tries 	 	work	.
i	do	one	 follow 	 ed 	 	by	 an 	 other 	 	,	the	answer	is	it	's	 rot 	 ation 	 	d	,	half	a	turn	.
what	i	if	i	did	it	in	the	other	order	?	would	it	make	any	 differ 	 ence 	 	?
let	's	see	.	let	's	do	the	third	of	the	turn	first	,	and	then	the	sixth	of	a	turn	.
of	course	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	any	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
it	still	 end 	 s 	 	up	at	half	a	turn	.
and	there	is	some	symmetry	here	in	the	way	the	 sym 	 me 	 tries 	 	interact	with	each	other	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	to	the	 sym 	 me 	 tries 	 	of	the	triangle	.
let	's	see	what	 happen 	 s 	 	if	we	do	two	 sym 	 me 	 tries 	 	with	the	triangle	,	one	after	the	other	.
let	's	do	a	 rot 	 ation 	 	by	a	third	of	a	turn	 anti 	 clock 	 wise 	 	,	and	reflect	in	the	line	through	x	.
well	,	the	 combine 	 d 	 	effect	is	 a 	 s 	 	if	i	had	just	 d 	 one 	 	the	 reflect 	 ion 	 	in	the	line	through	z	to	start	with	.
now	,	let	's	do	it	in	a	different	order	.
let	's	do	the	 reflect 	 ion 	 	in	x	first	,	 follow 	 ed 	 	by	the	 rot 	 ation 	 	by	a	third	of	a	turn	 anti 	 clock 	 wise 	 	.
the	 combine 	 d 	 	effect	,	the	triangle	 end 	 s 	 	up	 some 	 where 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	.	it	's	 a 	 s 	 	if	it	was	 reflect 	 ed 	 	in	the	line	through	y	.
now	it	 matter 	 s 	 	what	order	you	do	the	 operation 	 s 	 	in	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 en 	 able 	 s 	 	us	to	distinguish	why	the	 sym 	 me 	 tries 	 	of	these	 object 	 s 	 	--	they	both	have	six	 sym 	 me 	 tries 	 	.	so	why	should	n't	we	say	they	have	the	same	 sym 	 me 	 tries 	 	?
but	the	way	the	 sym 	 me 	 tries 	 	interact	 en 	 able 	 	us	--	we	've	now	got	a	language	to	distinguish	why	these	 sym 	 me 	 tries 	 	are	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	different	.
and	you	can	try	 th 	 is 	 	when	you	go	down	to	the	pub	,	 lat 	 er 	 	on	.
take	a	beer	mat	and	 rot 	 ate 	 	it	by	a	quarter	of	a	turn	,	then	flip	it	.	and	then	do	it	in	the	other	order	,
and	the	picture	will	be	facing	in	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	direction	.
now	,	galois	 produce 	 d 	 	some	 law 	 s 	 	for	how	these	 table 	 s 	 	--	how	 sym 	 me 	 tries 	 	interact	.
it	's	 al 	 most 	 	like	little	sudoku	 table 	 s 	 	.
you	do	n't	see	any	symmetry	twice	in	any	row	or	column	.
and	,	using	 t 	 hose 	 	 rule 	 s 	 	,	he	was	able	to	say	that	there	are	in	fact	 on 	 ly 	 	two	 object 	 s 	 	with	six	 sym 	 me 	 tries 	 	.
and	they	'll	be	the	same	 a 	 s 	 	the	 sym 	 me 	 tries 	 	of	the	triangle	,	or	the	 sym 	 me 	 tries 	 	of	the	six	-	 point 	 ed 	 	 star 	 fish 	 	.
i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
it	's	 al 	 most 	 	like	the	 con 	 cept 	 	of	number	 be 	 ing 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	for	symmetry	.
in	the	front	here	,	i	've	got	one	,	two	,	three	people	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	on	one	,	two	,	three	 chair 	 s 	 	.
the	people	on	the	 chair 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	different	,	but	the	number	,	the	abstract	idea	of	the	number	,	is	the	same	.
and	we	can	see	 th 	 is 	 	now	:	we	go	back	to	the	 wall 	 s 	 	in	the	alhambra	.
here	are	two	 ver 	 y 	 	different	 wall 	 s 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	different	 geo 	 metric 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	.
but	,	using	the	language	of	galois	,	we	can	understand	that	the	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	abstract	 sym 	 me 	 tries 	 	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	same	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	let	's	take	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	wall	with	the	 triangle 	 s 	 	with	a	little	twist	on	them	.
you	can	 rot 	 ate 	 	them	by	a	sixth	of	a	turn	if	you	 ignor 	 e 	 	the	 color 	 s 	 	.	we	're	not	 match 	 ing 	 	up	the	 color 	 s 	 	.
but	the	 shape 	 s 	 	match	up	if	i	 rot 	 ate 	 	by	a	sixth	of	a	turn	around	the	point	where	all	the	 triangle 	 s 	 	meet	.
what	about	the	center	of	a	triangle	?	i	can	 rot 	 ate 	 	by	a	third	of	a	turn	around	the	center	of	the	triangle	,	and	 every 	 thing 	 	 match 	 es 	 	up	.
and	then	there	is	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	place	 half 	 way 	 	 a 	 long 	 	an	edge	,	where	i	can	 rot 	 ate 	 	by	180	 degree 	 s 	 	.
and	all	the	 tile 	 s 	 	match	up	 aga 	 in 	 	.
so	 rot 	 ate 	 	 a 	 long 	 	 half 	 way 	 	 a 	 long 	 	the	edge	,	and	they	all	match	up	.
now	,	let	's	move	to	the	 ver 	 y 	 	different	-	looking	wall	in	the	alhambra	.
and	we	find	the	same	 sym 	 me 	 tries 	 	here	,	and	the	same	 interact 	 ion 	 	.
so	,	there	was	a	sixth	of	a	turn	.	a	third	of	a	turn	where	the	z	 piece 	 s 	 	meet	.	and	the	half	a	turn	is	 half 	 way 	 	between	the	six	 point 	 ed 	 	 star 	 s 	 	.
and	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	these	 wall 	 s 	 	look	 ver 	 y 	 	different	,	galois	 ha 	 s 	 	 produce 	 d 	 	a	language	to	say	that	in	fact	the	 sym 	 me 	 tries 	 	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	these	are	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	.
and	it	's	a	symmetry	we	call	6-3-2	.
here	is	 an 	 other 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	in	the	alhambra	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	wall	,	a	 ceil 	 ing 	 	,	and	a	floor	.
they	all	look	 ver 	 y 	 	different	.	but	 th 	 is 	 	language	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	say	that	they	are	 represent 	 ations 	 	of	the	same	 symmetric 	 al 	 	abstract	object	,	which	we	call	4-4-2	.	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	 foot 	 ball 	 	,
but	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	fact	that	there	are	two	 place 	 s 	 	where	you	can	 rot 	 ate 	 	by	a	quarter	of	a	turn	,	and	one	by	half	a	turn	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	power	of	the	language	is	even	more	,	 be 	 cause 	 	galois	can	say	,	``	did	the	moorish	 artist 	 s 	 	discover	all	of	the	possible	 sym 	 me 	 tries 	 	on	the	 wall 	 s 	 	in	the	alhambra	?	``
and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	they	 al 	 most 	 	did	.
you	can	prove	,	using	galois	'	language	,	there	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	17	different	 sym 	 me 	 tries 	 	that	you	can	do	in	the	 wall 	 s 	 	in	the	alhambra	.
and	they	,	if	you	try	to	produce	a	different	wall	with	 th 	 is 	 	18th	one	,	it	will	have	to	have	the	same	 sym 	 me 	 tries 	 	 a 	 s 	 	one	of	these	17	.
but	these	are	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	can	see	.
and	the	power	of	galois	'	 mathematic 	 al 	 	language	is	it	 al 	 so 	 	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	create	 symmetric 	 al 	 	 object 	 s 	 	in	the	 un 	 s 	 een 	 	world	,	beyond	the	two	-	dimensional	,	three	-	dimensional	,	all	the	way	through	to	the	four	-	or	five	-	or	infinite	-	dimensional	space	.
and	that	's	where	i	work	.	i	create	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 object 	 s 	 	,	 symmetric 	 al 	 	 object 	 s 	 	,	using	galois	'	language	,	in	 ver 	 y 	 	high	dimensional	 space 	 s 	 	.
so	i	think	it	's	a	great	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	 un 	 s 	 een 	 	,	which	the	power	of	 mathematic 	 al 	 	language	 allow 	 s 	 	you	to	create	.
so	,	like	galois	,	i	 stay 	 ed 	 	up	all	last	night	creating	a	new	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 symmetric 	 al 	 	object	for	you	,
and	i	've	got	a	picture	of	it	here	.
well	,	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	it	is	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	a	picture	.	if	i	could	have	my	board
at	the	side	here	,	great	,	 excel 	 lent 	 	.
here	we	are	.	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	i	ca	n't	show	you	a	picture	of	 th 	 is 	 	 symmetric 	 al 	 	object	.
but	here	is	the	language	which	 de 	 scribe 	 s 	 	how	the	 sym 	 me 	 tries 	 	interact	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	new	 symmetric 	 al 	 	object	 do 	 es 	 	not	have	a	name	yet	.
now	,	people	like	 get 	 ting 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 name 	 s 	 	on	 thing 	 s 	 	,	on	 crat 	 ers 	 	on	the	moon	or	new	species	of	 animal 	 s 	 	.
so	i	'm	going	to	give	you	the	chance	to	get	your	name	on	a	new	 symmetric 	 al 	 	object	which	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 be 	 en 	 	named	before	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	thing	--	species	die	away	,	and	 moon 	 s 	 	kind	of	get	hit	by	 met 	 e 	 ors 	 	and	explode	--	but	 th 	 is 	 	 mathematic 	 al 	 	object	will	live	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
it	will	make	you	 im 	 mortal 	 	.
in	order	to	win	 th 	 is 	 	 symmetric 	 al 	 	object	,	what	you	have	to	do	is	to	answer	the	question	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	you	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	 sym 	 me 	 tries 	 	 do 	 es 	 	a	rubik	's	cube	have	?
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	i	'm	going	to	sort	you	out	.
 ra 	 ther 	 	than	you	all	 shout 	 ing 	 	out	,	i	want	you	to	count	how	 man 	 y 	 	 digit 	 s 	 	there	are	in	that	number	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
if	you	've	got	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	 factor 	 ial 	 	,	you	've	got	to	expand	the	 factor 	 ial 	 s 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	now	if	you	want	to	play	,	i	want	you	to	stand	up	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
if	you	think	you	've	got	an	estimate	for	how	 man 	 y 	 	 digit 	 s 	 	,
right	--	we	've	 al 	 ready 	 	got	one	competitor	here	.
if	you	all	stay	down	he	 win 	 s 	 	it	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	 excel 	 lent 	 	.	so	we	've	got	four	here	,	five	,	six	.
great	.	 excel 	 lent 	 	.	that	should	get	us	going	.	all	right	.
 any 	 body 	 	with	five	or	less	 digit 	 s 	 	,	you	've	got	to	 s 	 it 	 	down	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	've	 under 	 estimate 	 d 	 	.
five	or	less	 digit 	 s 	 	.	so	,	if	you	're	in	the	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	you	've	got	to	 s 	 it 	 	down	.
60	 digit 	 s 	 	or	more	,	you	've	got	to	 s 	 it 	 	down	.	you	've	 over 	 estimate 	 d 	 	.
20	 digit 	 s 	 	or	less	,	 s 	 it 	 	down	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	 digit 	 s 	 	are	there	in	your	number	?
two	?	so	you	should	have	 s 	 at 	 	down	 ear 	 lier 	 	.
let	's	have	the	other	 one 	 s 	 	,	who	 s 	 at 	 	down	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	20	,	up	 aga 	 in 	 	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
if	i	told	you	20	or	less	,	stand	up	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	one	.	i	think	there	 we 	 re 	 	a	few	here	.
the	people	who	just	last	 s 	 at 	 	down	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	how	 man 	 y 	 	 digit 	 s 	 	do	you	have	in	your	number	?
21.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	good	.	how	 man 	 y 	 	do	you	have	in	 your 	 s 	 	?
18.	so	it	 go 	 es 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	 lad 	 y 	 	here	.
21	is	the	 close 	 st 	 	.
it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	--	the	number	of	 sym 	 me 	 tries 	 	in	the	rubik	's	cube	 ha 	 s 	 	25	 digit 	 s 	 	.
so	now	i	need	to	name	 th 	 is 	 	object	.
so	,	what	is	your	name	?
i	need	your	 sur 	 name 	 	.	 symmetric 	 al 	 	 object 	 s 	 	 general 	 ly 	 	--
spell	it	for	me	.
g	-	h	-	e	-	z	no	,	so	2	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	 be 	 en 	 	used	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	in	the	 mathematic 	 al 	 	language	.	so	you	ca	n't	have	that	one	.
so	ghez	,	there	we	go	.	that	's	your	new	 symmetric 	 al 	 	object	.
you	are	now	 im 	 mortal 	 	.
and	if	you	'd	like	your	own	 symmetric 	 al 	 	object	,	i	have	a	project	raising	money	for	a	 char 	 ity 	 	in	guatemala	,	where	i	will	stay	up	all	night	and	 dev 	 ise 	 	an	object	for	you	,	for	a	 don 	 ation 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	 char 	 ity 	 	to	help	 kid 	 s 	 	get	 in 	 to 	 	education	in	guatemala	.
and	i	think	what	 drive 	 s 	 	me	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 mathematic 	 ian 	 	,	are	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	which	are	not	 s 	 een 	 	,	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	have	n't	 discover 	 ed 	 	.
it	's	all	the	 un 	 answer 	 ed 	 	 question 	 s 	 	which	make	 mathematic 	 s 	 	a	living	subject	.
and	i	will	 al 	 ways 	 	come	back	to	 th 	 is 	 	quote	from	the	japanese	``	 essay 	 s 	 	in	idleness	``	:	``	in	 every 	 thing 	 	,	 uniform 	 ity 	 	is	 un 	 desir 	 able 	 	.
 leav 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 in 	 complete 	 	 make 	 s 	 	it	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	and	 give 	 s 	 	one	the	 feel 	 ing 	 	that	there	is	room	for	growth	.	``	thank	you	.
