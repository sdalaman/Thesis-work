our	mission	is	to	build	a	 detail 	 ed 	 	,	realistic	computer	model	of	the	human	brain	.
and	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	,	in	the	past	four	 year 	 s 	 	,	a	proof	of	 con 	 cept 	 	on	a	small	part	of	the	 rod 	 ent 	 	brain	,	and	with	 th 	 is 	 	proof	of	 con 	 cept 	 	we	are	now	 scal 	 ing 	 	the	project	up	to	reach	the	human	brain	.
why	are	we	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	?
there	are	three	 import 	 ant 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	.
the	first	is	,	it	's	essential	for	us	to	understand	the	human	brain	if	we	do	want	to	get	 a 	 long 	 	in	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	and	i	think	that	it	is	a	key	step	in	evolution	.
the	second	reason	is	,	we	can	not	keep	 do 	 ing 	 	animal	 experiment 	 ation 	 	 fore 	 ver 	 	,
and	we	have	to	 em 	 body 	 	all	our	data	and	all	our	knowledge	 in 	 to 	 	a	 work 	 ing 	 	model	.
it	's	like	a	noah	's	ark	.	it	's	like	an	 archiv 	 e 	 	.
and	the	third	reason	is	that	there	are	two	billion	people	on	the	planet	that	are	 affect 	 ed 	 	by	mental	 dis 	 order 	 	,	and	the	 drug 	 s 	 	that	are	used	 to 	 day 	 	are	 large 	 ly 	 	 empir 	 ical 	 	.
i	think	that	we	can	come	up	with	 ver 	 y 	 	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	 solution 	 s 	 	on	how	to	treat	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	.
now	,	even	at	 th 	 is 	 	stage	,	we	can	use	the	brain	model	to	explore	some	fundamental	 question 	 s 	 	about	how	the	brain	 work 	 s 	 	.
and	here	,	at	ted	,	for	the	first	time	,	i	'd	like	to	share	with	you	how	we	're	 address 	 ing 	 	one	 theor 	 y 	 	--	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 the 	 ories 	 	--	one	 theor 	 y 	 	of	how	the	brain	 work 	 s 	 	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	is	that	the	brain	 create 	 s 	 	,	 build 	 s 	 	,	a	version	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,
and	 project 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	version	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	like	a	bubble	,	all	around	us	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	of	course	a	 top 	 ic 	 	of	 philosoph 	 ical 	 	debate	for	centuries	.
but	,	for	the	first	time	,	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	address	 th 	 is 	 	,	with	brain	 simul 	 ation 	 	,	and	ask	 ver 	 y 	 	 system 	 atic 	 	and	 rigor 	 ous 	 	 question 	 s 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	could	possibly	be	true	.
the	reason	why	the	moon	is	huge	on	the	horizon	is	 simpl 	 y 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	our	 per 	 cept 	 ual 	 	bubble	 do 	 es 	 	not	stretch	out	380,000	 kilometer 	 s 	 	.
it	 run 	 s 	 	out	of	space	.
and	so	what	we	do	is	we	 compar 	 e 	 	the	 building 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	our	 per 	 cept 	 ual 	 	bubble	,	and	we	make	a	decision	.
we	make	a	decision	it	's	that	big	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	it	's	not	that	big	.	and	what	that	 illustr 	 ates 	 	is	that	 decision 	 s 	 	are	the	key	 thing 	 s 	 	that	support	our	 per 	 cept 	 ual 	 	bubble	.	it	 keep 	 s 	 	it	 al 	 ive 	 	.
 with 	 out 	 	 decision 	 s 	 	you	can	not	see	,	you	can	not	think	,	you	can	not	feel	.
and	you	may	think	that	 anesthet 	 ic 	 s 	 	work	by	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	you	 in 	 to 	 	some	deep	sleep	,	or	by	 block 	 ing 	 	your	 receptor 	 s 	 	so	that	you	do	n't	feel	pain	,	but	in	fact	most	 anesthet 	 ic 	 s 	 	do	n't	work	that	way	.
what	they	do	is	they	 introduc 	 e 	 	a	noise	 in 	 to 	 	the	brain	so	that	the	 neuro 	 ns 	 	can	not	understand	each	other	.
they	are	 con 	 fused 	 	,	and	you	can	not	make	a	decision	.
so	,	while	you	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	up	your	mind	what	the	doctor	,	the	surgeon	,	is	 do 	 ing 	 	while	he	's	 hack 	 ing 	 	away	at	your	body	,	he	's	long	gone	.
he	's	at	home	 hav 	 ing 	 	tea	.
so	,	when	you	walk	up	to	a	door	and	you	open	it	,	what	you	 compulsive 	 ly 	 	have	to	do	to	perceive	is	to	make	 decision 	 s 	 	,	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 decision 	 s 	 	about	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	room	,	the	 wall 	 s 	 	,	the	height	,	the	 object 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	.
99	percent	of	what	you	see	is	not	what	 come 	 s 	 	in	through	the	 eye 	 s 	 	.
it	is	what	you	infer	about	that	room	.
so	i	can	say	,	with	some	 certain 	 ty 	 	,	``	i	think	,	 there 	 fore 	 	i	am.	``
but	i	can	not	say	,	``	you	think	,	 there 	 fore 	 	you	are	,	``	 be 	 cause 	 	``	you	``	are	 with 	 in 	 	my	 per 	 cept 	 ual 	 	bubble	.
now	,	we	can	 specul 	 ate 	 	and	 philosoph 	 ize 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	we	do	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	to	for	the	next	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	.
we	can	ask	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	question	.
``	can	the	brain	build	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 per 	 ception 	 	?	``
is	it	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 do 	 ing 	 	it	?
 do 	 es 	 	it	have	the	 sub 	 stance 	 	to	do	it	?
and	that	's	what	i	'm	going	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	to	you	 to 	 day 	 	.
so	,	it	took	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	11	billion	 year 	 s 	 	to	build	the	brain	.
it	had	to	improve	it	a	little	bit	.
it	had	to	add	to	the	frontal	part	,	so	that	you	would	have	 instinct 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	had	to	cope	on	land	.
but	the	real	big	step	was	the	 neo 	 cortex 	 	.
it	's	a	new	brain	.	you	 need 	 ed 	 	it	.
the	 mammal 	 s 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	it	 be 	 cause 	 	they	had	to	cope	with	 parent 	 hood 	 	,	social	 interact 	 ions 	 	,	complex	cognitive	 function 	 s 	 	.
so	,	you	can	think	of	the	 neo 	 cortex 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	ultimate	solution	 to 	 day 	 	,	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	know	it	.
it	's	the	pinnacle	,	it	's	the	final	product	that	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 produce 	 d 	 	.
it	was	so	 success 	 ful 	 	in	evolution	that	from	mouse	to	man	it	 expand 	 ed 	 	about	a	 thousand 	 fold 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	 number 	 s 	 	of	 neuro 	 ns 	 	,	to	produce	 th 	 is 	 	 al 	 most 	 	 frighten 	 ing 	 	organ	,	structure	.
and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 stop 	 ped 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 evolution 	 ary 	 	path	.
in	fact	,	the	 neo 	 cortex 	 	in	the	human	brain	is	 evolv 	 ing 	 	at	an	enormous	speed	.
if	you	zoom	 in 	 to 	 	the	surface	of	the	 neo 	 cortex 	 	,	you	discover	that	it	's	made	up	of	little	 modul 	 es 	 	,	g	5	 processor 	 s 	 	,	like	in	a	computer	.
but	there	are	about	a	million	of	them	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	so	 success 	 ful 	 	in	evolution	that	what	we	did	was	to	 duplic 	 ate 	 	them	over	and	over	and	add	more	and	more	of	them	to	the	brain	 un 	 til 	 	we	ran	out	of	space	in	the	skull	.
and	the	brain	 start 	 ed 	 	to	fold	in	on	 it 	 self 	 	,	and	that	's	why	the	 neo 	 cortex 	 	is	so	 high 	 ly 	 	 con 	 volu 	 ted 	 	.
we	're	just	 pack 	 ing 	 	in	 column 	 s 	 	,	so	that	we	'd	have	more	 neo 	 cort 	 ical 	 	 column 	 s 	 	to	perform	more	complex	 function 	 s 	 	.
so	you	can	think	of	the	 neo 	 cortex 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	massive	grand	piano	,	a	million	-	key	grand	piano	.
each	of	these	 neo 	 cort 	 ical 	 	 column 	 s 	 	would	produce	a	note	.
you	 stimul 	 ate 	 	it	;	it	 produce 	 s 	 	a	 sym 	 phony 	 	.
but	it	's	not	just	a	 sym 	 phony 	 	of	 per 	 ception 	 	.
it	's	a	 sym 	 phony 	 	of	your	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	your	 re 	 ality 	 	.
now	,	of	course	it	 take 	 s 	 	 year 	 s 	 	to	learn	how	to	master	a	grand	piano	with	a	million	 key 	 s 	 	.
that	's	why	you	have	to	 s 	 end 	 	your	 kid 	 s 	 	to	good	 school 	 s 	 	,	 hope 	 fully 	 	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	to	oxford	.
but	it	's	not	 on 	 ly 	 	education	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 genetic 	 s 	 	.
you	may	be	born	 luck 	 y 	 	,	where	you	know	how	to	master	your	 neo 	 cort 	 ical 	 	column	,	and	you	can	play	a	fantastic	 sym 	 phony 	 	.
in	fact	,	there	is	a	new	 theor 	 y 	 	of	 aut 	 ism 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	``	 intens 	 e 	 	world	``	 theor 	 y 	 	,	which	 suggest 	 s 	 	that	the	 neo 	 cort 	 ical 	 	 column 	 s 	 	are	super	-	 column 	 s 	 	.
they	are	 high 	 ly 	 	 re 	 active 	 	,	and	they	are	super	-	plastic	,	and	so	the	 aut 	 ists 	 	are	 prob 	 ably 	 	 cap 	 able 	 	of	building	and	 learn 	 ing 	 	a	 sym 	 phony 	 	which	is	 un 	 think 	 able 	 	for	us	.
but	you	can	 al 	 so 	 	understand	that	if	you	have	a	disease	 with 	 in 	 	one	of	these	 column 	 s 	 	,	the	note	is	going	to	be	off	.
the	 per 	 ception 	 	,	the	 sym 	 phony 	 	that	you	create	is	going	to	be	 corrupt 	 ed 	 	,	and	you	will	have	 symptom 	 s 	 	of	disease	.
so	,	the	holy	 g 	 rail 	 	for	 neuro 	 science 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	to	understand	the	design	of	the	 neocorit 	 ical 	 	column	--	and	it	's	not	just	for	 neuro 	 science 	 	;	it	's	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	to	understand	 per 	 ception 	 	,	to	understand	 re 	 ality 	 	,	and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	to	even	 al 	 so 	 	understand	physical	 re 	 ality 	 	.
so	,	what	we	did	was	,	for	the	past	15	 year 	 s 	 	,	was	to	dissect	out	the	 neo 	 cortex 	 	,	 system 	 at 	 ically 	 	.
it	's	a	bit	like	going	and	 catalog 	 ing 	 	a	piece	of	the	 rain 	 forest 	 	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	 do 	 es 	 	it	have	?
what	 shape 	 s 	 	are	the	 tree 	 s 	 	?
how	 man 	 y 	 	of	each	type	of	tree	do	you	have	?	where	are	they	 position 	 ed 	 	?
but	it	's	a	bit	more	than	 catalog 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	and	discover	all	the	 rule 	 s 	 	of	communication	,	the	 rule 	 s 	 	of	 connect 	 ivity 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 neuro 	 ns 	 	do	n't	just	like	to	connect	with	any	 neuro 	 n 	 	.
they	 choos 	 e 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 care 	 fully 	 	who	they	connect	with	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	more	than	 catalog 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	to	build	three	-	dimensional	digital	 model 	 s 	 	of	them	.
and	we	did	that	for	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 neuro 	 ns 	 	,	built	digital	 model 	 s 	 	of	all	the	different	 type 	 s 	 	of	 neuro 	 ns 	 	we	came	 a 	 cross 	 	.
and	once	you	have	that	,	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	begin	to	build	the	 neo 	 cort 	 ical 	 	column	.
and	here	we	're	 coil 	 ing 	 	them	up	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	you	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	what	you	see	is	that	the	 branch 	 es 	 	intersect	 actual 	 ly 	 	in	 million 	 s 	 	of	 location 	 s 	 	,	and	at	each	of	these	 intersect 	 ions 	 	they	can	form	a	synapse	.
and	a	synapse	is	a	chemical	location	where	they	communicate	with	each	other	.
and	these	 synapse 	 s 	 	together	form	the	network	or	the	circuit	of	the	brain	.
now	,	the	circuit	,	you	could	 al 	 so 	 	think	of	 a 	 s 	 	the	fabric	of	the	brain	.
and	when	you	think	of	the	fabric	of	the	brain	,	the	structure	,	how	is	it	built	?	what	is	the	pattern	of	the	carpet	?
you	 real 	 ize 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	 pose 	 s 	 	a	fundamental	 challeng 	 e 	 	to	any	 theor 	 y 	 	of	the	brain	,	and	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	to	a	 theor 	 y 	 	that	 say 	 s 	 	that	there	is	some	 re 	 ality 	 	that	 emerge 	 s 	 	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	carpet	,	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	carpet	with	a	 part 	 icular 	 	pattern	.
the	reason	is	 be 	 cause 	 	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	design	secret	of	the	brain	is	 divers 	 ity 	 	.
every	 neuro 	 n 	 	is	different	.
it	's	the	same	in	the	forest	.	every	pine	tree	is	different	.
you	may	have	 man 	 y 	 	different	 type 	 s 	 	of	 tree 	 s 	 	,	but	every	pine	tree	is	different	.	and	in	the	brain	it	's	the	same	.
so	there	is	no	 neuro 	 n 	 	in	my	brain	that	is	the	same	 a 	 s 	 	 an 	 other 	 	,	and	there	is	no	 neuro 	 n 	 	in	my	brain	that	is	the	same	 a 	 s 	 	in	 your 	 s 	 	.
and	your	 neuro 	 ns 	 	are	not	going	to	be	oriented	and	 position 	 ed 	 	in	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	way	.
and	you	may	have	more	or	less	 neuro 	 ns 	 	.
so	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 like 	 ly 	 	that	you	got	the	same	fabric	,	the	same	 circuit 	 ry 	 	.
so	,	how	could	we	possibly	create	a	 re 	 ality 	 	that	we	can	even	understand	each	other	?
well	,	we	do	n't	have	to	 specul 	 ate 	 	.
we	can	look	at	all	10	million	 synapse 	 s 	 	now	.
we	can	look	at	the	fabric	.	and	we	can	change	 neuro 	 ns 	 	.
we	can	use	different	 neuro 	 ns 	 	with	different	 vari 	 ations 	 	.
we	can	position	them	in	different	 place 	 s 	 	,	orient	them	in	different	 place 	 s 	 	.
we	can	use	less	or	more	of	them	.
and	when	we	do	that	what	we	 discover 	 ed 	 	is	that	the	 circuit 	 ry 	 	 do 	 es 	 	change	.
but	the	pattern	of	how	the	 circuit 	 ry 	 	is	designed	 do 	 es 	 	not	.
so	,	the	fabric	of	the	brain	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	your	brain	may	be	 small 	 er 	 	,	 big 	 ger 	 	,	it	may	have	different	 type 	 s 	 	of	 neuro 	 ns 	 	,	different	 morpho 	 logies 	 	of	 neuro 	 ns 	 	,
we	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	share	the	same	fabric	.
and	we	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	species	-	specific	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	that	that	could	explain	why	we	ca	n't	communicate	 a 	 cross 	 	species	.
so	,	let	's	 s 	 witch 	 	it	on	.	but	to	do	it	,	what	you	have	to	do	is	you	have	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	come	 al 	 ive 	 	.
we	make	it	come	 al 	 ive 	 	with	 equ 	 ations 	 	,	a	lot	of	 mathematic 	 s 	 	.
and	,	in	fact	,	the	 equ 	 ations 	 	that	make	 neuro 	 ns 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 electric 	 al 	 	 gene 	 rator 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	by	two	cambridge	 no 	 bel 	 	 laureate 	 s 	 	.
so	,	we	have	the	 mathematic 	 s 	 	to	make	 neuro 	 ns 	 	come	 al 	 ive 	 	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	have	the	 mathematic 	 s 	 	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	how	 neuro 	 ns 	 	collect	information	,	and	how	they	create	a	little	 light 	 ning 	 	bolt	to	communicate	with	each	other	.
and	when	they	get	to	the	synapse	,	what	they	do	is	they	 effective 	 ly 	 	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	shock	the	synapse	.
it	's	like	 electric 	 al 	 	shock	that	 re 	 lease 	 s 	 	the	 chemical 	 s 	 	from	these	 synapse 	 s 	 	.
and	we	've	got	the	 mathematic 	 s 	 	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	 th 	 is 	 	process	.
so	we	can	 de 	 scribe 	 	the	communication	between	the	 neuro 	 ns 	 	.
there	 liter 	 ally 	 	are	 on 	 ly 	 	a	 hand 	 ful 	 	of	 equ 	 ations 	 	that	you	need	to	 simul 	 ate 	 	the	activity	of	the	 neo 	 cortex 	 	.
but	what	you	do	need	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	big	computer	.
and	in	fact	you	need	one	 lap 	 top 	 	to	do	all	the	 calcul 	 ations 	 	just	for	one	 neuro 	 n 	 	.
so	you	need	10,000	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	.
so	where	do	you	go	?	you	go	to	ibm	,	and	you	get	a	 super 	 computer 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	know	how	to	take	10,000	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	and	put	it	 in 	 to 	 	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	 refrige 	 rator 	 	.
so	now	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	blue	gene	 super 	 computer 	 	.
we	can	load	up	all	the	 neuro 	 ns 	 	,	each	one	on	to	 it 	 s 	 	processor	,	and	fire	it	up	,	and	see	what	 happen 	 s 	 	.
take	the	magic	carpet	for	a	ride	.
here	we	activate	it	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	 give 	 s 	 	the	first	 glimps 	 e 	 	of	what	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	your	brain	when	there	is	a	 stimul 	 ation 	 	.
it	's	the	first	view	.
now	,	when	you	look	at	that	the	first	time	,	you	think	,	``	my	god	.	how	is	 re 	 ality 	 	coming	out	of	that	?	``
but	,	in	fact	,	you	can	start	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	we	have	n't	trained	 th 	 is 	 	 neo 	 cort 	 ical 	 	column	to	create	a	specific	 re 	 ality 	 	.
but	we	can	ask	,	``	where	is	the	rose	?	``
we	can	ask	,	``	where	is	it	 in 	 side 	 	,	if	we	 stimul 	 ate 	 	it	with	a	picture	?	``
where	is	it	 in 	 side 	 	the	 neo 	 cortex 	 	?
 ultimate 	 ly 	 	it	's	got	to	be	there	if	we	 stimul 	 ated 	 	it	with	it	.
so	,	the	way	that	we	can	look	at	that	is	to	 ignor 	 e 	 	the	 neuro 	 ns 	 	,	 ignor 	 e 	 	the	 synapse 	 s 	 	,	and	look	just	at	the	raw	 electric 	 al 	 	activity	.
 be 	 cause 	 	that	is	what	it	's	creating	.
it	's	creating	 electric 	 al 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	.
so	when	we	did	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	for	the	first	time	,	saw	these	ghost	-	like	 structure 	 s 	 	:	 electric 	 al 	 	 object 	 s 	 	 appear 	 ing 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	 neo 	 cort 	 ical 	 	column	.
and	it	's	these	 electric 	 al 	 	 object 	 s 	 	that	are	 hold 	 ing 	 	all	the	information	about	 what 	 ever 	 	 stimul 	 ated 	 	it	.
and	then	when	we	 zoom 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	it	's	like	a	 ver 	 it 	 able 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
so	the	next	step	is	just	to	take	these	brain	 coordinate 	 s 	 	and	to	project	them	 in 	 to 	 	 per 	 cept 	 ual 	 	space	.
and	if	you	do	that	,	you	will	be	able	to	step	 in 	 side 	 	the	 re 	 ality 	 	that	is	 create 	 d 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	machine	,	by	 th 	 is 	 	piece	of	the	brain	.
so	,	in	 summ 	 ary 	 	,	i	think	that	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	may	have	--	it	's	possible	--	 evolv 	 ed 	 	a	brain	to	see	 it 	 self 	 	,	which	may	be	a	first	step	in	 be 	 coming 	 	aware	of	 it 	 self 	 	.
there	is	a	lot	more	to	do	to	test	these	 the 	 ories 	 	,	and	to	test	any	other	 the 	 ories 	 	.
but	i	hope	that	you	are	at	 l 	 east 	 	 part 	 ly 	 	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	that	it	is	not	 im 	 possible 	 	to	build	a	brain	.
we	can	do	it	 with 	 in 	 	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	if	we	do	succeed	,	we	will	 s 	 end 	 	to	ted	,	in	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	a	 holo 	 gram 	 	to	talk	to	you	.	thank	you	.
