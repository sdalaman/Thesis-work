i	'd	like	to	ask	you	,	what	do	these	three	people	have	in	common	?
well	,	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	 recogn 	 ize 	 	the	first	person	.
i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	you	're	all	avid	``	american	idol	``	 watch 	 ers 	 	.
but	you	might	not	 recogn 	 ize 	 	aydah	al	jahani	,	who	is	a	 contest 	 ant 	 	,	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	a	 final 	 ist 	 	,	in	the	poet	of	the	 million 	 s 	 	 com 	 petition 	 	,	which	is	 broad 	 cast 	 	out	of	abu	dhabi	,	and	 s 	 een 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	arab	world	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	contest	people	have	to	write	and	 re 	 cite 	 	original	 poet 	 ry 	 	,	in	the	nabati	form	of	 poet 	 ry 	 	,	which	is	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	bedouin	form	.
and	 lim 	 a 	 	sahar	was	a	 final 	 ist 	 	in	the	afghan	star	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	 com 	 petition 	 	.
now	,	before	i	go	any	further	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	i	know	it	all	 beg 	 an 	 	with	``	britain	's	got	talent	.	``
but	my	point	in	 discuss 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	to	show	you	--	i	hope	i	'll	be	able	to	show	you	how	these	merit	-	based	 com 	 petition 	 s 	 	,	with	equal	access	to	 every 	 one 	 	,	with	the	winner	 select 	 ed 	 	via	 vot 	 ing 	 	by	sms	,	are	changing	 trib 	 al 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	.
and	i	'm	going	to	focus	on	afghanistan	and	the	arab	world	with	the	uae	,	how	they	're	changing	 trib 	 al 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	,	not	by	 introduc 	 ing 	 	western	 idea 	 s 	 	,	but	by	 be 	 ing 	 	 integrate 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	language	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 place 	 s 	 	.
it	all	 begin 	 s 	 	with	 enjoy 	 ment 	 	.
video	:	we	are	late	to	watch	``	afghan	star	.	``
we	are	going	to	watch	``	afghan	star	.	``	we	are	late	.
we	are	running	late	.
we	must	go	to	watch	``	afghan	star	.	``
cynthia	schneider	:	these	 program 	 s 	 	are	 reach 	 ing 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 deep 	 ly 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
in	afghanistan	,	people	go	to	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 length 	 s 	 	to	be	able	to	watch	 th 	 is 	 	program	.
and	you	do	n't	 necess 	 arily 	 	have	to	have	your	own	tv	set	.
people	watch	it	all	over	the	country	 al 	 so 	 	in	public	 place 	 s 	 	.
but	it	 go 	 es 	 	beyond	 watch 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 al 	 so 	 	,	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	 campaign 	 ing 	 	.
people	 be 	 come 	 	so	 engag 	 ed 	 	that	they	have	 volunteer 	 s 	 	,	just	like	 politic 	 al 	 	 volunteer 	 s 	 	 any 	 way 	 	,	who	fan	out	over	the	 country 	 side 	 	,	 campaign 	 ing 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 candid 	 ate 	 	.
contestants	 al 	 so 	 	put	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	forward	.
now	,	of	course	there	is	a	certain	degree	of	ethnic	allegiance	,	but	not	 entire 	 ly 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	each	year	the	winner	 ha 	 s 	 	come	from	a	different	 trib 	 al 	 	group	.
 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 open 	 ed 	 	up	the	door	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	for	women	.
and	in	the	last	season	there	 we 	 re 	 	two	women	in	the	 final 	 ists 	 	.
one	of	them	,	 lim 	 a 	 	sahar	,	is	a	pashtun	from	kandahar	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 conserv 	 ative 	 	part	of	the	country	.
and	here	she	 relat 	 es 	 	,	in	the	 document 	 ary 	 	film	``	afghan	star	,	``	how	her	 friend 	 s 	 	 urge 	 d 	 	her	not	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	and	told	her	that	she	was	 leav 	 ing 	 	them	for	 demo 	 cracy 	 	.
but	she	 al 	 so 	 	 con 	 fide 	 s 	 	that	she	 know 	 s 	 	that	 member 	 s 	 	of	the	taliban	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	sms	-	ing	 vote 	 s 	 	in	for	her	.
aydah	al	jahnani	 al 	 so 	 	took	 risk 	 s 	 	and	put	 her 	 self 	 	out	,	to	compete	in	the	poet	of	the	 million 	 s 	 	 com 	 petition 	 	.
i	have	to	say	,	her	husband	 back 	 ed 	 	her	from	the	start	.
but	her	tribe	and	family	 urge 	 d 	 	her	not	to	compete	and	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	against	it	.
but	,	once	she	 start 	 ed 	 	to	win	,	then	they	got	 be 	 hind 	 	her	 aga 	 in 	 	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	 com 	 petition 	 	and	winning	is	a	universal	human	value	.
and	she	's	out	there	.
her	 poet 	 ry 	 	is	about	women	,	and	the	life	of	women	in	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
so	just	by	 present 	 ing 	 	 her 	 self 	 	and	 be 	 ing 	 	in	 com 	 petition 	 	with	men	--	 th 	 is 	 	 show 	 s 	 	the	 vot 	 ing 	 	on	the	program	--	it	 set 	 s 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	for	young	women	--	these	are	young	women	in	the	audience	of	the	program	--	in	abu	dhabi	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	people	in	the	 view 	 ing 	 	audience	.
now	you	'd	think	that	``	american	idol	``	would	 introduc 	 e 	 	a	measure	of	americanization	.
but	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	just	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
by	using	 th 	 is 	 	 engag 	 ing 	 	popular	format	for	 tradition 	 al 	 	,	local	culture	,	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	in	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	,	is	 precipit 	 ating 	 	a	 re 	 viv 	 al 	 	of	interest	in	nabati	 poet 	 ry 	 	,	 al 	 so 	 	in	 tradition 	 al 	 	dress	and	dance	and	music	.
and	for	afghanistan	,	where	the	taliban	 bann 	 ed 	 	music	for	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	,	it	is	 re 	 introduc 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 tradition 	 al 	 	music	.
they	do	n't	 s 	 ing 	 	pop	 song 	 s 	 	,	they	 s 	 ing 	 	afghan	music	.
and	they	 al 	 so 	 	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	how	to	lose	 grace 	 fully 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	 ave 	 ng 	 ing 	 	the	winner	.
no	small	thing	.
and	the	final	,	sort	of	,	 formula 	 tion 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	``	american	idol	``	format	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	just	 appear 	 ed 	 	in	afghanistan	,	is	a	new	program	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	 candid 	 ate 	 	.	``
and	in	 th 	 is 	 	program	,	people	present	policy	 platform 	 s 	 	that	are	then	 vot 	 ed 	 	on	.
 man 	 y 	 	of	them	are	too	young	to	run	for	 p 	 resident 	 	,
but	by	 put 	 ting 	 	the	 issue 	 s 	 	out	there	,	they	are	 in 	 flu 	 encing 	 	the	 p 	 resident 	 ial 	 	race	.
so	for	me	,	the	 sub 	 stance 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	 un 	 s 	 een 	 	is	how	 re 	 ality 	 	tv	is	 driv 	 ing 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	.
thank	you	.
