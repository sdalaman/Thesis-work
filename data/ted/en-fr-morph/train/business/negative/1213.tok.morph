what	i	want	to	talk	to	you	about	is	what	we	can	learn	from	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	the	 genome 	 s 	 	of	living	people	and	extinct	 human 	 s 	 	.
but	before	 do 	 ing 	 	that	,	i	just	 brief 	 ly 	 	want	to	 re 	 mind 	 	you	about	what	you	 al 	 ready 	 	know	:	that	our	 genome 	 s 	 	,	our	genetic	material	,	are	 store 	 d 	 	in	 al 	 most 	 	all	 cell 	 s 	 	in	our	bodies	in	 chromosom 	 es 	 	in	the	form	of	dna	,	which	is	 th 	 is 	 	famous	double	-	 hel 	 ical 	 	molecule	.
and	the	genetic	information	is	 contain 	 ed 	 	in	the	form	of	a	sequence	of	four	 base 	 s 	 	 abbrevi 	 ated 	 	with	the	 letter 	 s 	 	a	,	t	,	c	and	g	.
and	the	information	is	there	twice	--	one	on	each	strand	--	which	is	 import 	 ant 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	when	new	 cell 	 s 	 	are	 form 	 ed 	 	,	these	 strand 	 s 	 	come	 a 	 part 	 	,	new	 strand 	 s 	 	are	 synthesize 	 d 	 	with	the	old	 one 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 template 	 s 	 	in	an	 al 	 most 	 	perfect	process	.
but	 noth 	 ing 	 	,	of	course	,	in	nature	is	 total 	 ly 	 	perfect	,	so	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	an	error	is	made	and	a	wrong	letter	is	built	in	.
and	we	can	then	see	the	result	of	 s 	 uch 	 	 mutation 	 s 	 	when	we	 compar 	 e 	 	dna	 sequence 	 s 	 	among	us	here	in	the	room	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
if	we	 compar 	 e 	 	my	genome	to	the	genome	of	you	,	will	differ	between	us	.	and	these	 mutation 	 s 	 	 accumul 	 ate 	 	 approximate 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	function	of	time	.
so	if	we	add	in	a	chimpanzee	here	,	we	will	see	more	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	.
 approximate 	 ly 	 	one	letter	in	a	hundred	will	differ	from	a	chimpanzee	.
and	if	you	're	then	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	a	piece	of	dna	,	or	the	whole	genome	,	you	can	 re 	 construct 	 	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	the	dna	with	 t 	 hose 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	you	 observ 	 e 	 	.
and	 general 	 ly 	 	we	depict	our	 idea 	 s 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	in	the	form	of	 tree 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	.
the	two	human	dna	 sequence 	 s 	 	go	back	to	a	common	 ance 	 s 	 tor 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	.
 far 	 ther 	 	back	is	there	one	 share 	 d 	 	with	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	these	 mutation 	 s 	 	happen	 approximate 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	function	of	time	,	you	can	transform	these	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	to	 estimate 	 s 	 	of	time	,	where	the	two	 human 	 s 	 	,	 typical 	 ly 	 	,	will	share	a	common	 ance 	 s 	 tor 	 	about	half	a	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	with	the	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	,	it	will	be	in	the	order	of	five	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
so	what	 ha 	 s 	 	now	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	last	few	 year 	 s 	 	is	that	there	are	account	 techno 	 logies 	 	around	that	allow	you	to	see	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 piece 	 s 	 	of	dna	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
so	we	can	now	,	in	a	matter	of	 hour 	 s 	 	,	determine	a	whole	human	genome	.
each	of	us	,	of	course	,	 contain 	 s 	 	two	human	 genome 	 s 	 	--	one	from	our	 mother 	 s 	 	and	one	from	our	 father 	 s 	 	.
and	they	are	around	three	billion	 s 	 uch 	 	 letter 	 s 	 	long	.
and	we	will	find	that	the	two	 genome 	 s 	 	in	me	,	or	one	genome	of	mine	we	want	to	use	,	will	have	about	three	million	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	in	the	order	of	that	.
and	what	you	can	then	 al 	 so 	 	begin	to	do	is	to	say	,	``	how	are	these	genetic	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	 distribut 	 ed 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	world	?	``
and	if	you	do	that	,	you	find	a	certain	amount	of	genetic	 vari 	 ation 	 	in	africa	.
and	if	you	look	 out 	 side 	 	africa	,	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	find	less	genetic	 vari 	 ation 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	surprising	,	of	course	,	 be 	 cause 	 	in	the	order	of	six	to	eight	 time 	 s 	 	 few 	 er 	 	people	live	in	africa	than	 out 	 side 	 	africa	.
yet	the	people	 in 	 side 	 	africa	have	more	genetic	 vari 	 ation 	 	.
 more 	 over 	 	,	 al 	 most 	 	all	these	genetic	 vari 	 ants 	 	we	see	 out 	 side 	 	africa	have	 close 	 ly 	 	related	dna	 sequence 	 s 	 	that	you	find	 in 	 side 	 	africa	.
but	if	you	look	in	africa	,	there	is	a	component	of	the	genetic	 vari 	 ation 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	no	close	 relat 	 ive 	 s 	 	 out 	 side 	 	.
so	a	model	to	explain	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	a	part	of	the	african	 vari 	 ation 	 	,	but	not	all	of	it	,	[	 ha 	 s 	 	]	gone	out	and	 colon 	 ized 	 	the	rest	of	the	world	.
and	together	with	the	 method 	 s 	 	to	date	these	genetic	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	led	to	the	 in 	 sight 	 	that	modern	 human 	 s 	 	--	 human 	 s 	 	that	are	 essential 	 ly 	 	 in 	 distinguish 	 able 	 	from	you	and	me	--	 evolv 	 ed 	 	in	africa	,	 quit 	 e 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	between	100	and	200,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	 lat 	 er 	 	,	between	100	and	50,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	or	so	,	went	out	of	africa	to	 colon 	 ize 	 	the	rest	of	the	world	.
so	what	i	often	like	to	say	is	that	,	from	a	genomic	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	we	are	all	africans	.
we	either	live	 in 	 side 	 	africa	 to 	 day 	 	,	or	in	 quit 	 e 	 	 re 	 cent 	 	 ex 	 ile 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	 con 	 sequence 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 cent 	 	origin	of	modern	 human 	 s 	 	is	that	genetic	 vari 	 ants 	 	are	 general 	 ly 	 	 distribut 	 ed 	 	 wide 	 ly 	 	in	the	world	,	in	 man 	 y 	 	 place 	 s 	 	,	and	they	tend	to	vary	 a 	 s 	 	 grad 	 ient 	 s 	 	,	from	a	bird	's	-	eye	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	at	 l 	 east 	 	.
and	since	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	genetic	 vari 	 ants 	 	,	and	they	have	different	 s 	 uch 	 	 grad 	 ient 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	if	we	determine	a	dna	sequence	--	a	genome	from	one	individual	--	we	can	 quit 	 e 	 	 accurate 	 ly 	 	estimate	where	that	person	 come 	 s 	 	from	,	 provide 	 d 	 	that	 it 	 s 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	or	 grand 	 parent 	 s 	 	have	n't	 move 	 d 	 	around	too	much	.
but	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	then	mean	,	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	tend	to	think	,	that	there	are	huge	genetic	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	between	 group 	 s 	 	of	people	--	on	different	 continent 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	?
well	we	can	begin	to	ask	 t 	 hose 	 	 question 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	.
there	is	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	a	project	that	's	 under 	 way 	 	to	sequence	a	thousand	 individual 	 s 	 	--	 the 	 ir 	 	 genome 	 s 	 	--	from	different	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	world	.
they	've	 sequence 	 d 	 	185	africans	from	two	 population 	 s 	 	in	africa	.
[	they	've	]	 sequence 	 d 	 	 approximate 	 ly 	 	 equal 	 ly 	 	[	 a 	 s 	 	]	 man 	 y 	 	people	in	europe	and	in	 chin 	 a 	 	.
and	we	can	begin	to	say	how	much	 vari 	 ance 	 	do	we	find	,	how	 man 	 y 	 	 letter 	 s 	 	that	vary	in	at	 l 	 east 	 	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	individual	 sequence 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	a	lot	:	38	million	 vari 	 able 	 	 position 	 s 	 	.
but	we	can	then	ask	:	are	there	any	absolute	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	between	africans	and	non	-	africans	?
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 	most	of	us	would	imagine	 exist 	 ed 	 	.
and	with	absolute	 differ 	 ence 	 	--	and	i	mean	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	where	people	 in 	 side 	 	africa	at	a	certain	position	,	where	all	 individual 	 s 	 	--	100	percent	--	have	one	letter	,	and	 every 	 body 	 	 out 	 side 	 	africa	 ha 	 s 	 	 an 	 other 	 	letter	.
and	the	answer	to	that	,	among	 t 	 hose 	 	 million 	 s 	 	of	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	,	is	that	there	is	not	a	single	 s 	 uch 	 	position	.
 th 	 is 	 	may	be	surprising	.
 may 	 be 	 	a	single	individual	is	 mis 	 class 	 ified 	 	or	so	.
so	we	can	relax	the	 cri 	 ter 	 ion 	 	a	bit	and	say	:	how	 man 	 y 	 	 position 	 s 	 	do	we	find	where	95	percent	of	people	in	africa	have	one	 vari 	 ant 	 	,	95	percent	 an 	 other 	 	 vari 	 ant 	 	,	and	the	number	of	that	is	12	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	surprising	.
it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	when	we	look	at	people	and	see	a	person	from	africa	and	a	person	from	europe	or	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	,	we	can	not	,	for	a	single	position	in	the	genome	with	100	percent	 accu 	 racy 	 	,	predict	what	the	person	would	carry	.
and	 on 	 ly 	 	for	12	 position 	 s 	 	can	we	hope	to	be	95	percent	right	.
 th 	 is 	 	may	be	surprising	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	can	,	of	course	,	look	at	these	people	and	 quit 	 e 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	say	where	they	or	 the 	 ir 	 	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	came	from	.
so	what	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	now	is	that	 t 	 hose 	 	 trait 	 s 	 	we	then	look	at	and	so	 read 	 ily 	 	see	--	 fa 	 cial 	 	 feature 	 s 	 	,	skin	color	,	hair	structure	--	are	not	 determine 	 d 	 	by	single	 gene 	 s 	 	with	big	 effect 	 s 	 	,	but	are	 determine 	 d 	 	by	 man 	 y 	 	different	genetic	 vari 	 ants 	 	that	seem	to	vary	in	frequency	between	different	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	world	.
there	is	 an 	 other 	 	thing	with	 t 	 hose 	 	 trait 	 s 	 	that	we	so	 eas 	 ily 	 	 observ 	 e 	 	in	each	other	that	i	think	is	 worth 	 while 	 	to	consider	,	and	that	is	that	,	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 liter 	 al 	 	sense	,	they	're	 re 	 ally 	 	on	the	surface	of	our	bodies	.
they	are	what	we	just	 s 	 aid 	 	--	 fa 	 cial 	 	 feature 	 s 	 	,	hair	structure	,	skin	color	.
there	are	 al 	 so 	 	a	number	of	 feature 	 s 	 	that	vary	between	 continent 	 s 	 	like	that	that	have	to	do	with	how	we	 metabol 	 ize 	 	food	that	we	 ing 	 est 	 	,	or	that	have	to	do	with	how	our	 immun 	 e 	 	 system 	 s 	 	deal	with	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	that	try	to	 invad 	 e 	 	our	bodies	.
but	so	 t 	 hose 	 	are	all	 part 	 s 	 	of	our	bodies	where	we	 ver 	 y 	 	 direct 	 ly 	 	interact	with	our	environment	,	in	a	direct	 confront 	 ation 	 	,	if	you	like	.
it	's	easy	to	imagine	how	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 part 	 s 	 	of	our	bodies	 we 	 re 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	 influence 	 d 	 	by	 s 	 election 	 	from	the	environment	and	 shift 	 ed 	 	 fr 	 equ 	 encies 	 	of	 gene 	 s 	 	that	are	 involve 	 d 	 	in	them	.
but	if	we	look	on	other	 part 	 s 	 	of	our	bodies	where	we	do	n't	 direct 	 ly 	 	interact	with	the	environment	--	our	 kid 	 ney 	 s 	 	,	our	 liver 	 s 	 	,	our	 heart 	 s 	 	--	there	is	no	way	to	say	,	by	just	looking	at	these	 organ 	 s 	 	,	where	in	the	world	they	would	come	from	.
so	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	that	 come 	 s 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	 real 	 ization 	 	that	 human 	 s 	 	have	a	 re 	 cent 	 	common	origin	in	africa	,	and	that	is	that	when	 t 	 hose 	 	 human 	 s 	 	 emerge 	 d 	 	around	100,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	or	so	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	not	 al 	 one 	 	on	the	planet	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	other	 form 	 s 	 	of	 human 	 s 	 	around	,	most	 famous 	 ly 	 	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	 neanderthal 	 s 	 	--	these	 ro 	 bust 	 	 form 	 s 	 	of	 human 	 s 	 	,	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	the	left	here	with	a	modern	human	skeleton	on	the	right	--	that	 exist 	 ed 	 	in	western	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	and	europe	since	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
so	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	question	is	,	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	when	we	met	?
what	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	the	 neanderthal 	 s 	 	?
and	to	begin	to	answer	 s 	 uch 	 	 question 	 s 	 	,	my	research	group	--	since	over	25	 year 	 s 	 	now	--	 work 	 s 	 	on	 method 	 s 	 	to	 ex 	 tract 	 	dna	from	 remain 	 s 	 	of	 neanderthal 	 s 	 	and	extinct	 animal 	 s 	 	that	are	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 involve 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	technical	 issue 	 s 	 	in	how	you	 ex 	 tract 	 	the	dna	,	how	you	convert	it	to	a	form	you	can	sequence	.
you	have	to	work	 ver 	 y 	 	 care 	 fully 	 	to	avoid	 contami 	 nation 	 	of	 experiment 	 s 	 	with	dna	from	 your 	 self 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	then	,	in	 con 	 junction 	 	with	these	 method 	 s 	 	that	allow	 ver 	 y 	 	 man 	 y 	 	dna	 molecule 	 s 	 	to	be	 sequence 	 d 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	,	 allow 	 ed 	 	us	last	year	to	present	the	first	version	of	the	neanderthal	genome	,	so	that	any	one	of	you	can	now	look	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	on	the	neanderthal	genome	,	or	at	 l 	 east 	 	on	the	55	percent	of	it	that	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	 re 	 construct 	 	so	far	.
and	you	can	begin	to	 compar 	 e 	 	it	to	the	 genome 	 s 	 	of	people	who	live	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	one	question	that	you	may	then	want	to	ask	is	,	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	when	we	met	?
did	we	mix	or	not	?
and	the	way	to	ask	that	question	is	to	look	at	the	neanderthal	that	 come 	 s 	 	from	southern	europe	and	 compar 	 e 	 	it	to	 genome 	 s 	 	of	people	who	live	 to 	 day 	 	.
so	we	then	look	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	with	 pair 	 s 	 	of	 individual 	 s 	 	,	 start 	 ing 	 	with	two	africans	,	looking	at	the	two	african	 genome 	 s 	 	,	 find 	 ing 	 	 place 	 s 	 	where	they	differ	from	each	other	,	and	in	each	case	ask	:	what	is	a	neanderthal	like	?
 do 	 es 	 	it	match	one	african	or	the	other	african	?
we	would	expect	there	to	be	no	 differ 	 ence 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 neanderthal 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	never	in	africa	.
they	should	be	equal	,	have	no	reason	to	be	 close 	 r 	 	to	one	african	than	 an 	 other 	 	african	.
and	that	's	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	the	case	.
 statistic 	 ally 	 	 s 	 peaking 	 	,	there	is	no	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	how	often	the	neanderthal	 match 	 es 	 	one	african	or	the	other	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	different	if	we	now	look	at	the	european	individual	and	an	african	.
then	,	 significant 	 ly 	 	more	often	,	 do 	 es 	 	a	neanderthal	match	the	european	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	the	african	.
the	same	is	true	if	we	look	at	a	chinese	individual	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	an	african	,	the	neanderthal	will	match	the	chinese	individual	more	often	.
 th 	 is 	 	may	 al 	 so 	 	be	surprising	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 neanderthal 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	never	in	 chin 	 a 	 	.
so	the	model	we	've	 pro 	 posed 	 	to	explain	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	when	modern	 human 	 s 	 	came	out	of	africa	 some 	 time 	 	after	100,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	they	met	 neanderthal 	 s 	 	.	 pre 	 sum 	 ably 	 	,	they	did	so	first	in	the	middle	east	,	where	there	 we 	 re 	 	 neanderthal 	 s 	 	living	.
if	they	then	 mix 	 ed 	 	with	each	other	there	,	then	 t 	 hose 	 	modern	 human 	 s 	 	that	 be 	 came 	 	the	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	of	 every 	 one 	 	 out 	 side 	 	africa	carried	with	them	 th 	 is 	 	neanderthal	component	in	 the 	 ir 	 	genome	to	the	rest	of	the	world	.
so	that	 to 	 day 	 	,	the	people	living	 out 	 side 	 	africa	have	about	two	and	a	half	percent	of	 the 	 ir 	 	dna	from	 neanderthal 	 s 	 	.
so	 hav 	 ing 	 	now	a	neanderthal	genome	on	hand	 a 	 s 	 	a	 re 	 ference 	 	point	and	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	 techno 	 logies 	 	to	look	at	ancient	 remain 	 s 	 	and	 ex 	 tract 	 	the	dna	,	we	can	begin	to	 app 	 ly 	 	them	 else 	 where 	 	in	the	world	.
and	the	first	place	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	that	is	in	southern	siberia	in	the	altai	 mountain 	 s 	 	at	a	place	 call 	 ed 	 	denisova	,	a	cave	 s 	 ite 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	mountain	here	,	where	 archeo 	 logists 	 	in	2008	found	a	 tin 	 y 	 	little	piece	of	bone	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	copy	of	it	--	that	they	 real 	 ized 	 	came	from	the	last	 phal 	 anx 	 	and	it	was	well	 en 	 ough 	 	 preserve 	 d 	 	so	we	could	determine	the	dna	from	 th 	 is 	 	individual	,	even	to	a	 great 	 er 	 	 ex 	 tent 	 	than	for	the	 neanderthal 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	and	start	 relat 	 ing 	 	it	to	the	neanderthal	genome	and	to	people	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	we	found	that	 th 	 is 	 	individual	 share 	 d 	 	a	common	origin	for	his	dna	 sequence 	 s 	 	with	 neanderthal 	 s 	 	around	640,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	further	back	,	800,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	is	there	a	common	origin	with	present	day	 human 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	individual	 come 	 s 	 	from	a	population	that	 share 	 s 	 	an	origin	with	 neanderthal 	 s 	 	,	but	far	back	and	then	have	a	long	 in 	 dependent 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
we	call	 th 	 is 	 	group	of	 human 	 s 	 	,	that	we	then	 de 	 scribed 	 	for	the	first	time	from	 th 	 is 	 	 tin 	 y 	 	,	 tin 	 y 	 	little	piece	of	bone	,	the	denisovans	,	after	 th 	 is 	 	place	where	they	 we 	 re 	 	first	 de 	 scribed 	 	.
so	we	can	then	ask	for	denisovans	the	same	 thing 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	for	the	 neanderthal 	 s 	 	:	did	they	mix	with	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	of	present	day	people	?
if	we	ask	that	question	,	and	 compar 	 e 	 	the	denisovan	genome	to	people	around	the	world	,	we	 surprising 	 ly 	 	find	no	evidence	of	denisovan	dna	in	any	people	living	even	close	to	siberia	 to 	 day 	 	.
but	we	do	find	it	in	papua	new	guinea	and	in	other	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	in	melanesia	and	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 pre 	 sum 	 ably 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	these	denisovans	had	 be 	 en 	 	more	 wide 	 spread 	 	in	the	past	,	since	we	do	n't	think	that	the	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	of	melanesians	 we 	 re 	 	ever	in	siberia	.
so	from	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	these	 genome 	 s 	 	of	extinct	 human 	 s 	 	,	we	're	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	 arriv 	 e 	 	at	a	picture	of	what	the	world	 look 	 ed 	 	like	when	modern	 human 	 s 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	coming	out	of	africa	.
in	the	west	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	 neanderthal 	 s 	 	;	in	the	east	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	denisovans	--	 may 	 be 	 	other	 form 	 s 	 	of	 human 	 s 	 	too	that	we	've	not	yet	 de 	 scribed 	 	.
we	do	n't	know	 quit 	 e 	 	where	the	 border 	 s 	 	between	these	people	 we 	 re 	 	,	but	we	know	that	in	southern	siberia	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	both	 neanderthal 	 s 	 	and	denisovans	at	 l 	 east 	 	at	some	time	in	the	past	.
then	modern	 human 	 s 	 	 emerge 	 d 	 	 some 	 where 	 	in	africa	,	came	out	of	africa	,	 pre 	 sum 	 ably 	 	in	the	middle	east	.
they	meet	 neanderthal 	 s 	 	,	mix	with	them	,	 continu 	 e 	 	to	spread	over	the	world	,	and	 some 	 where 	 	in	 south 	 east 	 	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	,	they	meet	denisovans	and	mix	with	them	and	 continu 	 e 	 	on	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	.
and	then	these	 ear 	 lier 	 	 form 	 s 	 	of	 human 	 s 	 	disappear	,	but	they	live	on	a	little	bit	 to 	 day 	 	in	some	of	us	--	in	that	people	 out 	 side 	 	of	africa	have	two	and	a	half	percent	of	 the 	 ir 	 	dna	from	 neanderthal 	 s 	 	,	and	people	in	melanesia	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	an	 add 	 ition 	 al 	 	five	percent	 approximate 	 ly 	 	from	the	denisovans	.
 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	then	mean	that	there	is	after	all	some	absolute	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	people	 out 	 side 	 	africa	and	 in 	 side 	 	africa	in	that	people	 out 	 side 	 	africa	have	 th 	 is 	 	old	component	in	 the 	 ir 	 	genome	from	these	extinct	 form 	 s 	 	of	 human 	 s 	 	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	africans	do	not	?
well	i	do	n't	think	that	is	the	case	.
 pre 	 sum 	 ably 	 	,	modern	 human 	 s 	 	 emerge 	 d 	 	 some 	 where 	 	in	africa	.
they	spread	 a 	 cross 	 	africa	 al 	 so 	 	,	of	course	,	and	there	 we 	 re 	 	 old 	 er 	 	,	 ear 	 lier 	 	 form 	 s 	 	of	 human 	 s 	 	there	.
and	since	we	 mix 	 ed 	 	 else 	 where 	 	,	i	'm	 pre 	 tty 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	that	one	day	,	when	we	will	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	have	a	genome	of	 al 	 so 	 	these	 ear 	 lier 	 	 form 	 s 	 	in	africa	,	we	will	find	that	they	have	 al 	 so 	 	 mix 	 ed 	 	with	early	modern	 human 	 s 	 	in	africa	.
so	to	sum	up	,	what	have	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	 genome 	 s 	 	of	present	day	 human 	 s 	 	and	extinct	 human 	 s 	 	?
we	learn	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	but	one	thing	that	i	find	sort	of	 import 	 ant 	 	to	 ment 	 ion 	 	is	that	i	think	the	 less 	 on 	 	is	that	we	have	 al 	 ways 	 	 mix 	 ed 	 	.
we	 mix 	 ed 	 	with	these	 ear 	 lier 	 	 form 	 s 	 	of	 human 	 s 	 	,	 where 	 ver 	 	we	met	them	,	and	we	 mix 	 ed 	 	with	each	other	ever	since	.
thank	you	for	your	attention	.
