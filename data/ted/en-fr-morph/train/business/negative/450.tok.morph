right	when	i	was	15	was	when	i	first	got	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	solar	energy	.
my	family	had	 move 	 d 	 	from	fort	lee	,	new	jersey	to	california	,	and	we	 move 	 d 	 	from	the	snow	to	 lot 	 s 	 	of	heat	,	and	gas	lines	.
there	was	gas	 ration 	 ing 	 	in	1973	.
the	energy	crisis	was	in	full	bore	.	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 read 	 ing 	 	popular	science	magazine	,	and	i	got	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	the	potential	of	solar	energy	to	try	and	solve	that	crisis	.
i	had	just	taken	 tri 	 go 	 no 	 metry 	 	in	high	school	,	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	about	the	parabola	and	how	it	could	 concent 	 rate 	 	 ray 	 s 	 	of	light	to	a	single	focus	.
that	got	me	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	.
and	i	 re 	 ally 	 	felt	that	there	would	be	potential	to	build	some	kind	of	thing	that	could	 concent 	 rate 	 	light	.
so	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	company	 call 	 ed 	 	solar	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	company	where	i	built	 parabola 	 s 	 	,	i	took	metal	shop	,	and	i	remember	 walk 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	metal	shop	building	 parabola 	 s 	 	and	stirling	 engine 	 s 	 	.
and	i	was	building	 th 	 is 	 	stirling	engine	over	on	the	 la 	 the 	 	,	and	all	the	 bike 	 r 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	--	 motor 	 cycle 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	--	came	over	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	're	building	a	bong	,	are	n't	you	?	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	it	's	a	stirling	engine	.	it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	.	``
but	they	did	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	me	.
i	 s 	 old 	 	the	 plan 	 s 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	engine	and	for	 th 	 is 	 	dish	in	the	back	of	popular	science	magazine	,	for	four	 dollar 	 s 	 	each	.
and	i	 earn 	 ed 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	money	to	pay	for	my	first	year	of	caltech	.
it	was	a	 re 	 ally 	 	big	 excit 	 ement 	 	for	me	to	get	 in 	 to 	 	caltech	.
and	my	first	year	at	caltech	,	i	 continu 	 ed 	 	the	business	.
but	then	,	in	the	second	year	of	caltech	,	they	 start 	 ed 	 	 grad 	 ing 	 	.
the	whole	first	year	was	pass	/	fail	,	but	the	second	year	was	 grad 	 ed 	 	.
i	was	n't	able	to	keep	up	with	the	business	,	and	i	 end 	 ed 	 	up	with	a	25	-	year	 de 	 tour 	 	.
my	dream	had	 be 	 en 	 	to	convert	solar	energy	at	a	 ver 	 y 	 	practical	cost	,	but	then	i	had	 th 	 is 	 	big	 de 	 tour 	 	.
first	,	the	 course 	 work 	 	at	caltech	.
then	,	when	i	 graduate 	 d 	 	from	caltech	,	the	ibm	p.c	.	came	out	,	and	i	got	 addict 	 ed 	 	to	the	ibm	p.c	.	in	1981	.
and	then	in	1983	,	 lot 	 us 	 	1-2-3	came	out	,	and	i	was	 complete 	 ly 	 	blown	away	by	 lot 	 us 	 	1-2-3	.
i	 beg 	 an 	 	 oper 	 ating 	 	my	business	with	1-2-3	,	 beg 	 an 	 	writing	add	-	 in 	 s 	 	for	1-2-3	,	wrote	a	natural	language	 inter 	 face 	 	to	1-2-3	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	an	 education 	 al 	 	 soft 	 ware 	 	company	after	i	 join 	 ed 	 	 lot 	 us 	 	,	and	then	i	 start 	 ed 	 	idealab	so	i	could	have	a	roof	under	which	i	could	build	 multi 	 ple 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	in	 success 	 ion 	 
then	,	much	much	 lat 	 er 	 	--	in	2000	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	--	the	new	california	energy	crisis	--	or	what	was	 pur 	 port 	 ed 	 	to	be	a	big	energy	crisis	--	was	coming	.
and	i	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	if	there	was	some	way	we	could	build	 some 	 thing 	 	that	would	 capital 	 ize 	 	on	that	and	try	and	get	people	back	-	up	energy	,	in	case	the	crisis	 re 	 ally 	 	came	.
and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	looking	at	how	we	could	build	 batt 	 ery 	 	back	-	up	 system 	 s 	 	that	could	give	people	five	 hour 	 s 	 	,	10	 hour 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	even	a	full	day	,	or	three	 day 	 s 	 	'	worth	of	back	-	up	power	.
i	'm	glad	you	heard	 ear 	 lier 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	 batt 	 eries 	 	are	 un 	 believ 	 ably 	 	energy	--	lack	of	density	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	fuel	.
so	much	more	energy	can	be	 store 	 d 	 	with	fuel	than	with	 batt 	 eries 	 	.
you	'd	have	to	fill	your	entire	 park 	 ing 	 	space	of	one	 gar 	 age 	 	space	just	to	give	 your 	 self 	 	four	 hour 	 s 	 	of	 batt 	 ery 	 	back	-	up	.
and	i	 conclude 	 d 	 	,	after	 research 	 ing 	 	every	other	technology	that	we	could	deploy	for	storing	energy	--	 fly 	 wheel 	 s 	 	,	different	 formula 	 tions 	 	of	 batt 	 eries 	 	--	it	just	was	n't	practical	to	store	energy	.
so	what	about	making	energy	?
 may 	 be 	 	we	could	make	energy	.
i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	figure	out	--	 may 	 be 	 	solar	's	 be 	 come 	 	 attract 	 ive 	 	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	25	 year 	 s 	 	since	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	let	me	go	back	and	look	at	what	's	 be 	 en 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	with	solar	 cell 	 s 	 	.
and	the	price	had	gone	down	from	10	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	watt	to	about	four	or	five	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	watt	,	but	it	 stabil 	 ized 	 	.
and	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	to	get	much	lower	than	that	to	be	cost	effective	.
i	 stud 	 ied 	 	all	the	new	 thing 	 s 	 	that	had	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	solar	 cell 	 s 	 	,	and	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	look	for	ways	we	could	 innov 	 ate 	 	and	make	solar	 cell 	 s 	 	more	 in 	 expensive 	 ly 	 	.
there	are	a	lot	of	new	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 happen 	 ing 	 	to	do	that	,	but	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	the	process	 requir 	 es 	 	a	tremendous	amount	of	energy	.
some	people	even	say	it	 take 	 s 	 	more	energy	to	make	a	solar	cell	than	it	will	give	out	in	 it 	 s 	 	entire	life	.
 hope 	 fully 	 	,	if	we	can	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	amount	of	energy	it	 take 	 s 	 	to	make	the	 cell 	 s 	 	,	that	will	 be 	 come 	 	more	practical	.
but	right	now	,	you	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	have	to	take	silicon	,	put	it	in	an	oven	at	1600	 degree 	 s 	 	fahrenheit	for	17	 hour 	 s 	 	,	to	make	the	 cell 	 s 	 	.
a	lot	of	people	are	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 thing 	 s 	 	to	try	and	 reduc 	 e 	 	that	,	but	i	did	n't	have	 any 	 thing 	 	to	 con 	 tribute 	 	in	that	area	.
so	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	figure	out	what	other	way	could	we	try	and	make	cost	-	effective	solar	 electric 	 ity 	 	.
so	i	thought	of	an	idea	--	what	if	we	collect	the	 s 	 un 	 	with	a	large	 reflect 	 or 	 	--
like	i	had	 be 	 en 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	way	back	when	,	when	i	was	in	high	school	--
but	 may 	 be 	 	with	modern	technology	we	could	make	a	 cheap 	 er 	 	,	large	 collect 	 or 	 	,	 concent 	 rate 	 	it	to	a	small	 convert 	 er 	 	,	and	then	the	 con 	 version 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	would	n't	have	to	be	 a 	 s 	 	expensive	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	much	 small 	 er 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	solar	 cell 	 s 	 	,	which	have	to	be	 cover 	 ing 	 	the	entire	surface	area	that	you	want	to	gather	 s 	 un 	 	from	.
 th 	 is 	 	 seem 	 ed 	 	practical	now	,	 be 	 cause 	 	a	lot	of	new	 techno 	 logies 	 	had	come	in	the	25	 year 	 s 	 	since	i	had	last	 look 	 ed 	 	at	it	.
first	of	all	,	there	was	a	lot	of	new	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	,	not	to	 ment 	 ion 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	cheap	 miniatur 	 e 	 	 motor 	 s 	 	--	 brush 	 less 	 	 motor 	 s 	 	,	 serv 	 o 	 	 motor 	 s 	 	,	 step 	 per 	 	 motor 	 s 	 	,	that	are	used	in	 print 	 ers 	 	and	 scanner 	 s 	 	and	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	.
so	,	that	's	a	 break 	 through 	 	.
of	course	,	 in 	 expensive 	 	 micro 	 processor 	 s 	 	and	then	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 break 	 through 	 	--	genetic	 algorithm 	 s 	 	.
i	'll	be	 ver 	 y 	 	short	on	genetic	 algorithm 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	 power 	 ful 	 	way	of	solving	intractable	 problem 	 s 	 	using	natural	 s 	 election 	 	.
you	take	a	problem	that	you	ca	n't	solve	with	a	 pur 	 e 	 	 mathematic 	 al 	 	answer	,	you	build	an	 evolution 	 ary 	 	system	to	try	 multi 	 ple 	 	tries	at	 guess 	 ing 	 	,	you	add	 s 	 ex 	 	--	where	you	take	half	of	one	solution	and	half	of	 an 	 other 	 	and	then	make	new	 mutation 	 s 	 	--	and	you	use	natural	 s 	 election 	 	to	kill	off	not	 a 	 s 	 	good	 solution 	 s 	 	.
 usual 	 ly 	 	,	with	a	genetic	algorithm	on	a	computer	 to 	 day 	 	,	with	a	three	 giga 	 hertz 	 	processor	you	can	solve	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 form 	 er 	 ly 	 	intractable	 problem 	 s 	 	in	just	a	matter	of	 minute 	 s 	 	.
we	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	come	up	with	a	way	to	use	genetic	 algorithm 	 s 	 	to	create	a	new	type	of	 concent 	 rator 	 	.
and	i	'll	show	you	what	we	came	up	with	.
 tradition 	 ally 	 	,	 concent 	 rator 	 s 	 	look	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	 shape 	 s 	 	are	 parabola 	 s 	 	.
they	take	all	the	parallel	 in 	 coming 	 	 ray 	 s 	 	and	focus	it	to	a	single	spot	.
they	have	to	track	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	have	to	be	 point 	 ing 	 	 direct 	 ly 	 	at	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
they	 usual 	 ly 	 	have	about	a	one	degree	 accept 	 ance 	 	angle	,
meaning	once	they	're	more	than	about	a	degree	off	,	 non 	 e 	 	of	the	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	 ray 	 s 	 	will	hit	the	focus	.
so	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	come	up	with	a	way	of	making	a	non	-	 track 	 ing 	 	 collect 	 or 	 	,	a	 collect 	 or 	 	that	would	gather	much	more	than	one	degree	of	light	,	with	no	moving	 part 	 s 	 	.
so	we	 create 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	genetic	algorithm	to	try	 th 	 is 	 	out	,	we	made	a	model	in	xl	of	a	multi	-	surface	 reflect 	 or 	 	,	and	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	thing	 evolv 	 ed 	 	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	,	from	 try 	 ing 	 	a	billion	 cycle 	 s 	 	,	a	billion	different	 attempt 	 s 	 	,	with	a	 fit 	 ness 	 	function	that	defined	how	can	you	collect	the	most	light	,	from	the	most	 angle 	 s 	 	,	over	a	day	,	from	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	shape	that	 evolv 	 ed 	 	.
it	's	 th 	 is 	 	non	-	 track 	 ing 	 	 collect 	 or 	 	with	these	six	tuba	-	like	 horn 	 s 	 	,	and	each	of	them	collect	light	in	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	way	--	if	the	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	 strike 	 s 	 	right	here	,	it	might	 bounc 	 e 	 	right	to	the	center	,	the	hot	spot	,	 direct 	 ly 	 	,	but	if	the	 s 	 un 	 	is	off	-	axis	and	 come 	 s 	 	from	the	side	,	it	might	hit	two	 place 	 s 	 	and	take	two	 bounc 	 es 	 	.
so	for	direct	light	,	it	 take 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	one	 bounc 	 e 	 	,	for	off	-	axis	light	it	might	take	two	,	and	for	 extrem 	 e 	 	off	-	axis	,	it	might	take	three	.
your	efficiency	 go 	 es 	 	down	with	more	 bounc 	 es 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	lose	about	10	percent	with	each	 bounc 	 e 	 	,
but	 th 	 is 	 	 allow 	 ed 	 	us	to	collect	light	from	a	plus	or	minus	25	degree	angle	.
so	,	about	two	and	a	half	 hour 	 s 	 	of	the	day	we	could	collect	with	a	 station 	 ary 	 	component	.
solar	 cell 	 s 	 	collect	light	for	four	and	a	half	 hour 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	.
on	an	average	 adjust 	 ed 	 	day	,	a	solar	cell	--
 be 	 cause 	 	the	 s 	 un 	 	's	moving	 a 	 cross 	 	the	sky	,	the	solar	cell	is	going	down	with	a	 s 	 ine 	 	wave	function	of	performance	at	the	off	-	axis	 angle 	 s 	 	.
it	 collect 	 s 	 	about	four	and	a	half	average	 hour 	 s 	 	of	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	a	day	.
so	,	even	 th 	 is 	 	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	it	was	great	with	no	moving	 part 	 s 	 	--	we	could	 achiev 	 e 	 	high	 temperature 	 s 	 	--	was	n't	 en 	 ough 	 	.
we	 need 	 ed 	 	to	beat	solar	 cell 	 s 	 	.
so	we	took	a	look	at	 an 	 other 	 	idea	.
we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	a	way	to	break	up	a	parabola	 in 	 to 	 	individual	 pet 	 al 	 s 	 	that	would	track	.
so	what	you	see	here	is	12	 separat 	 e 	 	 pet 	 al 	 s 	 	,	that	each	could	be	controlled	with	individual	 micro 	 processor 	 s 	 	that	would	 on 	 ly 	 	cost	a	dollar	.
you	can	buy	a	two	 mega 	 hertz 	 	 micro 	 processor 	 	for	a	dollar	now	.
and	you	can	buy	 step 	 per 	 	 motor 	 s 	 	that	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	never	wear	out	 be 	 cause 	 	they	have	no	 brush 	 es 	 	,	for	a	dollar	.
we	can	control	all	12	of	these	 pet 	 al 	 s 	 	for	under	50	 dollar 	 s 	 	and	what	 th 	 is 	 	would	allow	us	to	do	is	not	have	to	move	the	focus	any	more	,	but	 on 	 ly 	 	move	the	 pet 	 al 	 s 	 	.
the	whole	system	would	have	a	much	lower	profile	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	we	could	gather	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	for	six	and	a	half	to	seven	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	.
now	that	we	have	 concent 	 rated 	 	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	,	what	are	we	going	to	put	at	the	center	to	convert	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	to	 electric 	 ity 	 	?
so	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	look	at	all	the	different	heat	 engine 	 s 	 	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	used	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	to	try	and	convert	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	to	 electric 	 ity 	 	,	or	heat	to	 electric 	 ity 	 	.
and	one	of	the	great	 one 	 s 	 	of	all	time	,	james	watt	's	 s 	 team 	 	engine	of	1788	was	a	major	,	major	 break 	 through 	 	.
james	watt	did	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	invent	the	 s 	 team 	 	engine	,	he	just	 refine 	 d 	 	it	.
but	,	his	 refine 	 ments 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	.
he	 add 	 ed 	 	new	linear	motion	 guide 	 s 	 	to	the	 piston 	 s 	 	,	he	 add 	 ed 	 	a	 condens 	 er 	 	to	cool	the	 s 	 team 	 	 out 	 side 	 	the	cylinder	,	he	made	the	engine	double	-	 act 	 ing 	 	so	it	had	double	the	power	.
 t 	 hose 	 	 we 	 re 	 	major	 break 	 through 	 s 	 	.
i	mean	,	all	of	the	 improve 	 ments 	 	he	made	--
and	it	's	 just 	 ifiable 	 	that	our	measure	of	energy	,	the	watt	,	 to 	 day 	 	is	named	after	him	.
so	we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	engine	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	had	some	potential	.
 s 	 team 	 	 engine 	 s 	 	are	 danger 	 ous 	 	,	and	they	had	tremendous	impact	on	the	world	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	know	--	industrial	revolution	and	 ship 	 s 	 	and	 loco 	 motive 	 s 	 	.
but	they	're	 usual 	 ly 	 	good	to	be	large	,	so	they	're	not	good	for	 distribut 	 ed 	 	power	generation	.
but	they	're	 al 	 so 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	high	pressure	,	so	they	're	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	type	of	engine	is	the	hot	air	engine	.
and	the	hot	air	engine	 al 	 so 	 	was	not	 invent 	 ed 	 	by	robert	stirling	,	but	robert	stirling	came	 a 	 long 	 	in	1816	and	 radical 	 ly 	 	 improv 	 ed 	 	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	engine	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	so	 interest 	 ing 	 	--	it	 on 	 ly 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	on	air	,	no	 s 	 team 	 	--	 ha 	 s 	 	led	to	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	creative	 design 	 s 	 	over	the	 year 	 s 	 	that	use	the	stirling	engine	principle	.
but	after	the	stirling	engine	,	otto	came	 a 	 long 	 	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	,	he	did	n't	invent	the	internal	 com 	 bust 	 ion 	 	engine	,	he	just	 refine 	 d 	 	it	.
he	 show 	 ed 	 	it	in	paris	in	1867	,	and	it	was	a	major	 achiev 	 ement 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 br 	 ought 	 	the	power	density	of	the	engine	way	up	.
you	could	now	get	a	lot	more	power	in	a	lot	 small 	 er 	 	space	,	and	that	 allow 	 ed 	 	the	engine	to	be	used	for	mobile	 application 	 s 	 	.
so	,	once	you	have	 mobil 	 ity 	 	,	now	you	're	making	a	lot	of	 engine 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	you	've	got	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 unit 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	 s 	 team 	 	 ship 	 s 	 	or	big	 factor 	 ies 	 	where	you	're	not	making	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 unit 	 s 	 	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	engine	that	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 benefit 	 ing 	 	from	mass	production	where	all	the	other	 engine 	 s 	 	did	n't	benefit	.
so	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	went	 in 	 to 	 	mass	production	,	 cost 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 reduc 	 ed 	 	,	100	 year 	 s 	 	of	 refine 	 ment 	 	,	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 reduc 	 ed 	 	,	tremendous	production	value	.
there	have	 be 	 en 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	internal	 com 	 bust 	 ion 	 	 engine 	 s 	 	built	,	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	stirling	 engine 	 s 	 	built	.
and	not	 near 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	small	 s 	 team 	 	 engine 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	built	 any 	 more 	 	,	 on 	 ly 	 	large	 one 	 s 	 	for	big	 operation 	 s 	 	.
so	after	looking	at	these	three	,	and	47	 other 	 s 	 	,	we	 conclude 	 d 	 	that	the	stirling	engine	would	be	the	best	one	to	use	.
i	want	to	give	you	a	brief	 explan 	 ation 	 	of	how	we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	it	and	how	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
so	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	look	at	the	stirling	engine	in	a	new	way	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	practical	--	weight	no	 long 	 er 	 	 matter 	 ed 	 	for	our	application
the	internal	 com 	 bust 	 ion 	 	engine	took	off	 be 	 cause 	 	weight	 matter 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	you	 we 	 re 	 	moving	around	.
but	if	you	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	generate	solar	energy	in	a	static	place	the	weight	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	so	much	.
the	other	thing	we	 discover 	 ed 	 	is	that	efficiency	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	so	much	if	your	energy	source	is	free	.
 normal 	 ly 	 	,	efficiency	is	 cruci 	 al 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	fuel	cost	of	your	engine	over	 it 	 s 	 	life	 dwarf 	 s 	 	the	cost	of	the	engine	.
but	if	your	fuel	source	is	free	,	then	the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	that	 matter 	 s 	 	is	the	up	-	front	capital	cost	of	the	engine	.
so	you	do	n't	want	to	optimize	for	efficiency	,	you	want	to	optimize	for	power	per	dollar	.
so	using	that	new	twist	,	with	the	new	 cri 	 ter 	 ia 	 	,	we	thought	we	could	re	-	look	at	the	stirling	engine	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	 br 	 ing 	 	genetic	 algorithm 	 s 	 	in	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	,	robert	stirling	did	n't	have	gordon	moore	before	him	to	get	us	three	 giga 	 hertz 	 	of	processor	power	.
so	we	took	the	same	genetic	algorithm	that	we	used	 ear 	 lier 	 	to	make	that	 concent 	 rator 	 	,	which	did	n't	work	out	for	us	,	to	optimize	the	stirling	engine	,	and	make	 it 	 s 	 	design	 s 	 ize 	 s 	 	and	all	of	 it 	 s 	 	 dimension 	 s 	 	the	exact	 optim 	 um 	 	to	get	the	most	power	per	dollar	,	 ir 	 respect 	 ive 	 	of	weight	,	 ir 	 respect 	 ive 	 	of	 s 	 ize 	 	,	to	get	the	most	 con 	 version 	 	of	solar	energy	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 s 	 un 	 	is	free	.
and	that	's	the	process	we	took	--	let	me	show	you	how	the	engine	 work 	 s 	 	.
the	 simpl 	 est 	 	heat	engine	,	or	hot	air	engine	,	of	all	time	would	be	 th 	 is 	 	--	take	a	box	,	a	steel	 can 	 ist 	 er 	 	,	with	a	piston	.
put	a	flame	under	it	,	the	piston	 move 	 s 	 	up	.
take	it	off	the	flame	and	pour	water	on	it	,	or	let	it	cool	down	,	the	piston	 move 	 s 	 	down	.
that	's	a	heat	engine	.
that	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	the	most	fundamental	heat	engine	you	could	possibly	have	.
the	problem	is	the	efficiency	is	one	 hundred 	 th 	 	of	one	percent	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	 heat 	 ing 	 	all	the	metal	of	the	chamber	and	then	 cool 	 ing 	 	all	the	metal	of	the	chamber	each	time	.
and	you	're	 on 	 ly 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	power	from	the	air	that	's	 heat 	 ing 	 	at	the	same	time	,	but	you	're	 was 	 ting 	 	all	the	energy	 heat 	 ing 	 	the	metal	and	 cool 	 ing 	 	the	metal	.
so	 some 	 one 	 	came	up	with	a	 ver 	 y 	 	clever	idea	,
to	--	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 heat 	 ing 	 	the	whole	cylinder	and	 cool 	 ing 	 	the	whole	cylinder	,	what	about	if	you	put	a	 dis 	 place 	 r 	 	 in 	 side 	 	--	a	little	thing	that	 shuttle 	 s 	 	the	air	back	and	forth	.
you	move	that	up	and	down	with	a	little	bit	of	energy	but	now	you	're	 on 	 ly 	 	shifting	the	air	down	to	the	hot	end	and	up	to	the	cold	end	,	down	to	the	hot	end	and	up	to	the	cold	end	.
so	,	now	you	're	not	 alternate 	 ly 	 	 heat 	 ing 	 	and	 cool 	 ing 	 	the	metal	,	you	're	just	 alternate 	 ly 	 	 heat 	 ing 	 	and	 cool 	 ing 	 	the	air	.
that	 allow 	 s 	 	you	to	get	the	efficiency	up	from	a	 hundred 	 th 	 	of	a	percent	to	about	two	percent	.
and	then	robert	stirling	came	 a 	 long 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	 gen 	 ius 	 	idea	,	which	was	,	well	i	'm	still	not	 heat 	 ing 	 	the	metal	now	,	with	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	engine	,	but	i	'm	still	 re 	 heat 	 ing 	 	all	the	air	.
i	'm	still	 heat 	 ing 	 	the	air	every	time	and	 cool 	 ing 	 	the	air	every	time	.
what	about	if	i	put	a	thermal	sponge	in	the	middle	,	in	the	 pass 	 age 	 way 	 	between	where	the	air	 ha 	 s 	 	to	move	between	hot	and	cold	?
so	he	made	fine	 wire 	 s 	 	,	and	 crack 	 ed 	 	glass	,	and	all	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 material 	 s 	 	to	be	a	heat	sponge	.
so	when	the	air	 push 	 es 	 	up	to	go	from	the	hot	end	to	the	cold	end	,	it	 put 	 s 	 	some	heat	 in 	 to 	 	the	sponge	.
and	then	when	the	air	 come 	 s 	 	back	after	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 cool 	 ed 	 	it	 pick 	 s 	 	up	that	heat	 aga 	 in 	 	.
so	you	're	 re 	 using 	 	your	energy	five	or	six	 time 	 s 	 	,	and	that	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	the	efficiency	up	between	30	and	40	percent
it	's	a	little	known	,	but	 brilli 	 ant 	 	,	 gen 	 ius 	 	 invent 	 ion 	 	of	robert	stirling	that	 take 	 s 	 	the	hot	air	engine	from	 be 	 ing 	 	 some 	 what 	 	 im 	 practical 	 	--	like	i	found	out	when	i	made	the	real	simple	version	in	high	school	--	to	 ver 	 y 	 	 potential 	 ly 	 	possible	,	once	you	get	the	efficiency	up	,	if	you	can	design	 th 	 is 	 	to	be	low	 en 	 ough 	 	cost	.
so	we	 re 	 ally 	 	set	out	on	a	path	to	try	and	make	the	 low 	 est 	 	cost	possible	.
we	built	a	huge	 mathematic 	 al 	 	model	of	how	a	stirling	engine	 work 	 s 	 	.
we	 appli 	 ed 	 	the	genetic	algorithm	.
we	got	the	 result 	 s 	 	from	that	for	the	optimal	engine	.
we	built	 engine 	 s 	 	--	so	we	built	100	different	 engine 	 s 	 	over	the	last	two	 year 	 s 	 	.
we	 measur 	 ed 	 	each	one	,	we	 re 	 adjust 	 ed 	 	the	model	to	what	we	 measur 	 ed 	 	,	and	then	we	led	that	to	the	current	prototype	.
it	led	to	a	 ver 	 y 	 	compact	,	 in 	 expensive 	 	engine	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	the	engine	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
let	me	show	you	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	in	real	life	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	engine	.
it	's	just	a	small	cylinder	down	here	which	 hold 	 s 	 	the	 gene 	 rator 	 	 in 	 side 	 	and	all	the	 link 	 age 	 	and	it	's	the	hot	cap	--	the	hot	cylinder	on	the	top	--	 th 	 is 	 	part	 get 	 s 	 	hot	,	 th 	 is 	 	part	is	cool	,	and	 electric 	 ity 	 	 come 	 s 	 	out	.
the	exact	 con 	 verse 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	true	.
if	you	put	 electric 	 ity 	 	in	,	 th 	 is 	 	will	get	hot	and	 th 	 is 	 	will	get	cold	,	you	get	 refrige 	 ration 	 	.
so	it	's	a	complete	 revers 	 ible 	 	cycle	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	efficient	cycle	,	and	 quit 	 e 	 	a	simple	thing	to	make	.
so	now	you	put	the	two	 thing 	 s 	 	together	.
so	you	have	the	engine	,	now	what	if	you	combine	the	 pet 	 al 	 s 	 	and	the	engine	in	the	center	?
the	 pet 	 al 	 s 	 	track	and	the	engine	 get 	 s 	 	the	 concent 	 rated 	 	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	,	take	that	heat	and	turn	it	 in 	 to 	 	 electric 	 ity 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	the	first	prototype	of	our	system	 look 	 ed 	 	like	together	with	the	 pet 	 al 	 s 	 	and	the	engine	in	the	center	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 be 	 ing 	 	run	out	in	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	and	now	i	want	to	show	you	what	the	actual	thing	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
thank	you	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	unit	with	the	12	 pet 	 al 	 s 	 
these	 pet 	 al 	 s 	 	cost	about	a	dollar	each	--	they	're	 light 	 weight 	 	,	 inject 	 ion 	 	 mold 	 ed 	 	plastic	,	 a 	 lumin 	 ized 	 	.
the	 mechan 	 ism 	 	to	control	each	 pet 	 al 	 	is	 be 	 low 	 	there	with	a	 micro 	 processor 	 	on	each	one	.
there	are	 thermo 	 couple 	 s 	 	on	the	engine	--	little	 sensor 	 s 	 	that	detect	the	heat	when	the	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	 strike 	 s 	 	them	.
each	 pet 	 al 	 	 adjust 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	 separat 	 e 	 ly 	 	to	keep	the	highest	temperature	on	it	.
when	the	 s 	 un 	 	 come 	 s 	 	out	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	the	 pet 	 al 	 s 	 	will	seek	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	find	it	by	 search 	 ing 	 	for	the	highest	temperature
about	a	minute	and	a	half	or	two	 minute 	 s 	 	after	the	 ray 	 s 	 	are	 s 	 tri 	 king 	 	the	hot	cap	the	engine	will	be	warm	 en 	 ough 	 	to	start	and	then	the	engine	will	generate	 electric 	 ity 	 	for	about	six	and	a	half	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	--	six	and	a	half	to	seven	 hour 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 s 	 un 	 	 move 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	sky
a	critical	part	that	we	can	take	advantage	of	is	that	we	have	these	 in 	 expensive 	 	 micro 	 processor 	 s 	 	and	each	one	of	these	 pet 	 al 	 s 	 	are	autonomous	,	and	each	one	of	these	 pet 	 al 	 s 	 	 figure 	 s 	 	out	where	the	 s 	 un 	 	is	with	no	user	set	-	up	.
so	you	do	n't	have	to	tell	what	latitude	,	 long 	 itude 	 	you	're	at	,	you	do	n't	have	to	tell	what	your	roof	 slop 	 e 	 	angle	is	,	you	do	n't	have	to	tell	what	 orient 	 ation 	 	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	care	.
what	it	 do 	 es 	 	is	it	 search 	 es 	 	to	find	the	 hot 	 test 	 	spot	,	it	 search 	 es 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	a	half	an	hour	 lat 	 er 	 	,	it	 search 	 es 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	a	day	 lat 	 er 	 	,	it	 search 	 es 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	a	month	 lat 	 er 	 	.
it	 bas 	 ically 	 	 figure 	 s 	 	out	where	on	earth	you	are	by	 watch 	 ing 	 	the	direction	the	 s 	 un 	 	 move 	 s 	 	,	so	you	do	n't	have	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	enter	 any 	 thing 	 	about	that	.
the	way	the	unit	 work 	 s 	 	is	,	when	the	 s 	 un 	 	 come 	 s 	 	out	the	engine	will	start	and	you	get	power	out	here	.
we	have	a.c.	and	d.c.	,	get	12	 volt 	 s 	 	d.c.	,	so	that	could	be	used	for	certain	 application 	 s 	 	.
we	have	an	 in 	 vert 	 er 	 	in	there	,	so	you	get	117	 volt 	 s 	 	a.c.	and	you	 al 	 so 	 	get	hot	water	.
the	hot	water	's	 option 	 al 	 	.
you	do	n't	have	to	use	the	hot	water	,	it	will	cool	 it 	 self 	 	.
but	you	can	use	it	to	 option 	 ally 	 	heat	hot	water	and	that	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	the	efficiency	up	even	 high 	 er 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	some	of	the	heat	that	you	would	 normal 	 ly 	 	be	 reject 	 ing 	 	,	you	can	now	use	 a 	 s 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	energy	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	for	a	pool	or	hot	water	.
let	me	show	you	a	quick	movie	of	what	 th 	 is 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	running	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	test	where	we	took	it	 out 	 side 	 	and	each	of	the	 pet 	 al 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 individual 	 ly 	 	seeking	.
and	what	they	do	is	step	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 coarse 	 ly 	 	at	first	,	and	then	 ver 	 y 	 	 fine 	 ly 	 	 after 	 ward 	 	.
once	they	get	a	temperature	 read 	 ing 	 	on	the	 thermo 	 couple 	 	 indic 	 ating 	 	they	found	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	then	they	 s 	 low 	 	down	and	do	a	fine	search	,	then	all	the	 pet 	 al 	 s 	 	will	move	 in 	 to 	 	position	,	and	then	the	engine	will	start	.
so	,	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	for	the	last	two	 year 	 s 	 	.
we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	the	progress	,	we	do	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	long	way	to	go	 th 	 ough 	 	still	,	and	let	me	tell	you	a	little	bit	more	about	that	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	how	we	envision	it	would	be	in	a	 resident 	 ial 	 	 install 	 ation 	 	:	you	'd	 prob 	 ably 	 	have	more	than	one	unit	on	your	roof	.
it	could	be	on	your	roof	,	or	in	your	 back 	 yard 	 	,	or	 some 	 where 	 	else	.
you	do	n't	have	to	have	 en 	 ough 	 	 unit 	 s 	 	to	power	your	entire	house	,	you	just	 s 	 ave 	 	money	with	each	 increment 	 al 	 	one	you	add	.
so	you	're	still	using	the	grid	 potential 	 ly 	 	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	type	of	application	,	to	be	your	back	-	up	supply	--	of	course	,	you	ca	n't	use	these	at	night	,	and	you	ca	n't	use	these	on	 cloud 	 y 	 	 day 	 s 	 	.
but	by	 reduc 	 ing 	 	your	energy	use	,	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	at	the	peak	 time 	 s 	 	--	 usual 	 ly 	 	when	you	have	you	air	 condition 	 ing 	 	on	,	or	other	 time 	 s 	 	like	that	--	 th 	 is 	 	 generate 	 s 	 	the	peak	power	at	the	peak	 us 	 age 	 	time	,	so	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 comple 	 ment 	 ary 	 	in	that	sense	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	how	we	would	envision	a	 resident 	 ial 	 	application	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	think	there	's	 ver 	 y 	 	big	potential	for	energy	 farm 	 s 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	in	remote	land	where	there	 happen 	 s 	 	to	be	a	lot	of	 s 	 un 	 	.
it	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	good	combination	of	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 factor 	 s 	 	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	there	's	a	lot	of	 power 	 ful 	 	 s 	 un 	 	all	around	the	world	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	but	in	special	 place 	 s 	 	where	it	 happen 	 s 	 	to	be	 relat 	 ively 	 	 in 	 expensive 	 	to	place	these	and	 al 	 so 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	more	 place 	 s 	 	where	there	is	high	wind	power	.
so	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	that	is	,	here	's	the	map	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 every 	 where 	 	that	's	not	green	or	blue	is	a	 re 	 ally 	 	ideal	place	,	but	even	the	green	or	blue	 area 	 s 	 	are	good	,	just	not	 a 	 s 	 	good	 a 	 s 	 	the	 place 	 s 	 	that	are	red	,	 o 	 range 	 	and	yellow	.
but	the	hot	 s 	 port 	 	right	around	las	vegas	and	death	 val 	 ley 	 	and	that	area	is	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	good	.
and	all	 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	is	affect	the	 pay 	 back 	 	period	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	that	you	could	n't	use	solar	energy	;	you	could	use	solar	energy	 any 	 where 	 	on	earth	.
it	just	 affect 	 s 	 	the	 pay 	 back 	 	period	if	you	're	 compar 	 ing 	 	to	grid	-	 suppli 	 ed 	 	 electric 	 ity 	 	.
but	if	you	do	n't	have	grid	-	 suppli 	 ed 	 	 electric 	 ity 	 	,	then	the	whole	question	of	 pay 	 back 	 	is	a	different	one	 entire 	 ly 	 	.
it	's	just	how	 man 	 y 	 	 watt 	 s 	 	do	you	get	per	dollar	,	and	how	could	you	benefit	from	that	using	that	power	to	change	your	life	in	some	way	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	map	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	map	of	the	whole	earth
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	you	can	see	a	huge	 swath 	 e 	 	in	the	middle	of	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	where	a	large	part	of	the	population	is	,	there	's	tremendous	 chance 	 s 	 	for	solar	energy	.
and	of	course	,	look	at	africa	.
it	's	just	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	what	the	potential	is	to	take	advantage	of	solar	energy	there	,	and	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	to	talk	more	about	 find 	 ing 	 	ways	we	can	help	with	that	.
so	,	in	 con 	 clusion 	 	,	i	would	say	my	journey	 ha 	 s 	 	 show 	 n 	 	me	that	you	can	 re 	 visit 	 	old	 idea 	 s 	 	in	a	new	light	,	and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	 dis 	 card 	 ed 	 	in	the	past	can	be	practical	now	if	you	 app 	 ly 	 	some	new	technology	or	new	 twist 	 s 	 	.
we	 believ 	 e 	 	we	're	 get 	 ting 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	close	to	 some 	 thing 	 	practical	and	 afford 	 able 	 	.
our	short	-	term	goal	for	 th 	 is 	 	is	to	be	half	the	price	of	solar	 cell 	 s 	 	and	our	 long 	 er 	 	-	term	goal	is	to	be	less	than	a	five	-	year	 pay 	 back 	 	.
and	at	less	than	a	five	-	year	 pay 	 back 	 	,	all	of	a	sudden	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	economic
so	you	do	n't	have	to	just	want	to	have	a	feel	-	good	attitude	about	energy	to	want	to	have	one	of	these	.
it	just	 make 	 s 	 	economic	sense	.
right	now	,	solar	 pay 	 back 	 s 	 	are	between	30	and	50	 year 	 s 	 	.
if	you	get	it	down	 be 	 low 	 	five	 year 	 s 	 	then	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 al 	 most 	 	a	no	-	 brain 	 er 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	interest	to	own	it	--	 some 	 one 	 	else	will	finance	it	for	you	and	you	can	just	make	money	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	from	day	one	.
so	that	's	our	real	 power 	 ful 	 	goal	that	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 shoot 	 ing 	 	for	in	the	company	.
two	other	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	surprising	to	me	--	one	was	how	casual	we	are	about	energy	.
i	was	 walk 	 ing 	 	from	the	 elev 	 ator 	 	over	here	,	and	even	just	looking	at	the	stage	right	now	--	so	there	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	20	500	watt	 light 	 s 	 	right	now	.
there	's	10,000	 watt 	 s 	 	of	light	 pour 	 ing 	 	on	the	stage	,	one	 horse 	 power 	 	is	756	 watt 	 s 	 	,	at	full	power	.
so	there	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	15	 horse 	 s 	 	running	at	full	speed	just	to	keep	the	stage	lit	.
not	to	 ment 	 ion 	 	the	200	 horse 	 s 	 	that	are	 prob 	 ably 	 	running	right	now	to	keep	the	 air 	 condition 	 ing 	 	going	.
and	it	's	just	 amaz 	 ing 	 	,	walk	in	the	 elev 	 ator 	 	and	there	's	 light 	 s 	 	on	in	the	 elev 	 ator 	 	.
of	course	,	now	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	sensitive	at	home	when	we	 leav 	 e 	 	the	 light 	 s 	 	on	by	 mistak 	 e 	 	.
but	,	 every 	 where 	 	around	us	we	have	 in 	 sati 	 able 	 	use	for	energy	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	so	cheap	.
and	it	's	cheap	 be 	 cause 	 	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 subsidize 	 d 	 	by	energy	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	 concent 	 rated 	 	by	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	,	oil	is	solar	energy	 concent 	 rate 	 	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 pound 	 ed 	 	for	a	billion	 year 	 s 	 	with	a	lot	of	energy	to	make	it	have	all	that	energy	 contain 	 ed 	 	in	it	.
and	we	do	n't	have	a	 birth 	 right 	 	to	just	use	that	up	 a 	 s 	 	fast	 a 	 s 	 	we	are	,	i	think	.
and	it	would	be	great	if	we	could	find	a	way	to	make	our	energy	 us 	 age 	 	 renew 	 able 	 	,	where	 a 	 s 	 	we	're	using	the	energy	we	're	creating	it	at	the	same	pace	,	and	i	 re 	 ally 	 	hope	we	can	get	there	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	,	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	a	great	audience	.
