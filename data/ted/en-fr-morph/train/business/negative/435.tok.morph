my	work	is	play	.
and	i	play	when	i	design	.
i	even	 look 	 ed 	 	it	up	in	the	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	,	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	that	,	and	the	definition	of	play	,	number	one	,	was	 engag 	 ing 	 	in	a	 child 	 like 	 	activity	or	endeavor	,	and	number	two	was	 gam 	 bling 	 	.
and	i	 real 	 ize 	 	i	do	both	when	i	'm	 design 	 ing 	 	.
i	'm	both	a	kid	and	i	'm	 gam 	 bling 	 	all	the	time	.
and	i	think	that	if	you	're	not	,	there	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 inherent 	 ly 	 	wrong	if	you	're	a	 design 	 er 	 	.
but	the	serious	part	is	what	threw	me	,	and	i	could	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	get	a	handle	on	it	 un 	 til 	 	i	 remember 	 ed 	 	an	essay	.
and	it	's	an	essay	i	read	30	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
it	was	written	by	russell	 bake 	 r 	 	,	who	used	to	write	an	``	 observ 	 er 	 	``	column	in	the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	.
he	's	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	humorist	.	and	i	'm	going	to	read	you	 th 	 is 	 	essay	,	or	an	excerpt	from	it	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 re 	 ally 	 	hit	home	for	me	.
here	is	a	letter	of	friendly	 ad 	 vice 	 	.
be	serious	,	it	 say 	 s 	 	.
what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	,	of	course	,	is	,	be	solemn	.
 be 	 ing 	 	solemn	is	easy	.
 be 	 ing 	 	serious	is	hard	.
children	 al 	 most 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	begin	by	 be 	 ing 	 	serious	,	which	is	what	 make 	 s 	 	them	so	 entertain 	 ing 	 	when	 compar 	 ed 	 	with	 adult 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	class	.
 adult 	 s 	 	,	on	the	whole	,	are	solemn	.
in	 politic 	 s 	 	,	the	rare	 candid 	 ate 	 	who	is	serious	,	like	adlai	stevenson	,	is	 eas 	 ily 	 	 overwhelm 	 ed 	 	by	one	who	is	solemn	,	like	eisenhower	.
that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	hard	for	most	people	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	 serious 	 ness 	 	,	which	is	rare	,
but	more	 comfort 	 able 	 	to	endorse	solemnity	,	which	is	 common 	 place 	 	.
 jog 	 ging 	 	,	which	is	 common 	 place 	 	,	and	 wide 	 ly 	 	 accept 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	good	for	you	,	is	solemn	.
 poke 	 r 	 	is	serious	.
washington	,	d.c.	is	solemn	.
new	york	is	serious	.
going	to	 education 	 al 	 	 con 	 ference 	 s 	 	to	tell	you	 any 	 thing 	 	about	the	future	is	solemn	.
taking	a	long	walk	by	 your 	 self 	 	,	 dur 	 ing 	 	which	you	 dev 	 ise 	 	a	 fool 	 proof 	 	scheme	for	 rob 	 bing 	 	tiffany	's	,	is	serious	.
now	,	when	i	 app 	 ly 	 	russell	 bake 	 r 	 	's	definition	of	solemnity	or	 serious 	 ness 	 	to	design	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 necess 	 arily 	 	make	any	 part 	 icular 	 	point	about	quality	.
solemn	design	is	often	 import 	 ant 	 	and	 ver 	 y 	 	effective	design	.
solemn	design	is	 al 	 so 	 	 social 	 ly 	 	correct	,	and	is	 accept 	 ed 	 	by	appropriate	 audience 	 s 	 	.
it	's	what	right	-	 think 	 ing 	 	 design 	 ers 	 	and	all	the	 client 	 s 	 	are	 striv 	 ing 	 	for	.
serious	design	,	serious	play	,	is	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
for	one	thing	,	it	often	 happen 	 s 	 	 spontane 	 ously 	 	,	 intuitive 	 ly 	 	,	 accident 	 ally 	 	or	 incident 	 ally 	 	.
it	can	be	 achiev 	 ed 	 	out	of	 innoc 	 ence 	 	,	or	 arrog 	 ance 	 	,	or	out	of	 self 	 ish 	 ness 	 	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	out	of	 care 	 lessness 	 	.
but	 most 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	 achiev 	 ed 	 	through	all	 t 	 hose 	 	kind	of	crazy	 part 	 s 	 	of	human	behavior	that	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	make	any	sense	.
serious	design	is	 im 	 perfect 	 	.
it	's	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	the	kind	of	craft	 law 	 s 	 	that	come	from	 some 	 thing 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	the	first	of	 it 	 s 	 	kind	.
serious	design	is	 al 	 so 	 	--	often	--	 quit 	 e 	 	unsuccessful	from	the	solemn	point	of	view	.
that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	the	art	of	serious	play	is	about	 invent 	 ion 	 	,	change	,	 rebel 	 lion 	 	--	not	 perfect 	 ion 	 	.
 perfect 	 ion 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	solemn	play	.
now	,	i	 al 	 ways 	 	saw	design	 care 	 ers 	 	like	surreal	 stair 	 case 	 s 	 	.
if	you	look	at	the	 stair 	 case 	 	,	you	'll	see	that	in	your	20s	the	risers	are	 ver 	 y 	 	high	and	the	 step 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	short	,	and	you	make	huge	 discover 	 ies 	 	.
you	sort	of	leap	up	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	in	your	youth	.
that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	you	do	n't	know	 any 	 thing 	 	and	you	have	a	lot	to	learn	,
and	so	that	 any 	 thing 	 	you	do	is	a	 learn 	 ing 	 	experience	and	you	're	just	 jump 	 ing 	 	right	up	there	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	get	 old 	 er 	 	,	the	risers	get	shallower	and	the	 step 	 s 	 	get	 wide 	 r 	 	,	and	you	start	moving	 a 	 long 	 	at	a	 s 	 lower 	 	pace	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	making	 few 	 er 	 	 discover 	 ies 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	get	 old 	 er 	 	and	more	 decr 	 epit 	 	,	you	sort	of	inch	 a 	 long 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	 depress 	 ing 	 	,	long	 stair 	 case 	 	,	 lead 	 ing 	 	you	 in 	 to 	 	 obliv 	 ion 	 	.
i	find	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	to	be	serious	.
i	'm	 hire 	 d 	 	to	be	solemn	,	but	i	find	more	and	more	that	i	'm	solemn	when	i	do	n't	have	to	be	.
and	in	my	35	 year 	 s 	 	of	 work 	 ing 	 	experience	,	i	think	i	was	 re 	 ally 	 	serious	four	 time 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'm	going	to	show	them	to	you	now	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	came	out	of	 ver 	 y 	 	specific	 condition 	 s 	 	.
it	's	great	to	be	a	kid	.
now	,	when	i	was	in	my	early	20s	,	i	 work 	 ed 	 	in	the	record	business	,	 design 	 ing 	 	record	 cover 	 s 	 	for	cbs	 record 	 s 	 	,	and	i	had	no	idea	what	a	great	job	i	had	.
i	thought	 every 	 body 	 	had	a	job	like	that	.
and	what	--	the	way	i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	design	and	the	way	i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	world	was	,	what	was	going	on	around	me	and	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	came	at	the	time	i	 walk 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	design	 we 	 re 	 	the	 ene 	 my 	 	.
i	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 hat 	 ed 	 	the	 type 	 face 	 	helvetica	.
i	thought	the	 type 	 face 	 	helvetica	was	the	cleanest	,	most	 bor 	 ing 	 	,	most	fascistic	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 repress 	 ive 	 	 type 	 face 	 	,	and	i	 hat 	 ed 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	that	was	designed	in	helvetica	.
and	when	i	was	in	my	college	 day 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	sort	of	design	that	was	 fashion 	 able 	 	and	popular	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	a	 love 	 ly 	 	book	jacket	by	rudy	de	harak	,	but	i	just	 hat 	 ed 	 	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	designed	with	helvetica	,
and	i	made	parodies	about	it	.
i	just	thought	it	was	,	you	know	,	 complete 	 ly 	 	 bor 	 ing 	 	.
so	--	so	,	my	goal	in	life	was	to	do	stuff	that	was	n't	made	out	of	helvetica	.
and	to	do	stuff	that	was	n't	made	out	of	helvetica	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	kind	of	hard	 be 	 cause 	 	you	had	to	find	it	.
and	there	 we 	 re 	 	n't	a	lot	of	 book 	 s 	 	about	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	design	in	the	early	70s	.	there	 we 	 re 	 	n't	--	there	was	n't	a	 ple 	 th 	 ora 	 	of	design	 publish 	 ing 	 	.
you	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	to	go	to	 anti 	 que 	 	 store 	 s 	 	.	you	had	to	go	to	europe	.
you	had	to	go	 place 	 s 	 	and	find	the	stuff	.
and	what	i	 respond 	 ed 	 	to	was	,	you	know	,	art	nouveau	,	or	deco	,	or	victorian	 typo 	 graphy 	 	,	or	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	just	 complete 	 ly 	 	not	helvetica	.
and	i	taught	 my 	 self 	 	design	 th 	 is 	 	way	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	was	sort	of	my	early	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	i	used	these	 thing 	 s 	 	in	 re 	 ally 	 	 goof 	 y 	 	ways	on	record	 cover 	 s 	 	and	in	my	design	.
i	was	n't	educated	.	i	just	sort	of	put	these	 thing 	 s 	 	together	.
i	 mix 	 ed 	 	up	victorian	 design 	 s 	 	with	pop	,	and	i	 mix 	 ed 	 	up	art	nouveau	with	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
and	i	made	these	 ver 	 y 	 	lush	,	 ver 	 y 	 	elaborate	record	 cover 	 s 	 	,	not	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	 be 	 ing 	 	a	post	-	 modern 	 ist 	 	or	a	historicist	--	 be 	 cause 	 	i	did	n't	know	what	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	.
i	just	 hat 	 ed 	 	helvetica	.
and	that	kind	of	 pass 	 ion 	 	drove	me	 in 	 to 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	serious	play	,	a	kind	of	play	i	could	never	do	now	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	too	well	-	educated	.
and	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	about	that	form	of	youth	,	where	you	can	let	 your 	 self 	 	grow	and	play	,	and	be	 re 	 ally 	 	a	 bra 	 t 	 	,	and	then	accomplish	 thing 	 s 	 	.
by	the	end	of	the	'70s	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	the	stuff	 be 	 came 	 	known	.
i	mean	,	these	 cover 	 s 	 	 appear 	 ed 	 	all	over	the	world	,	and	they	 start 	 ed 	 	winning	 a 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	and	people	 k 	 new 	 	them	.
and	i	was	 sudden 	 ly 	 	a	post	-	 modern 	 ist 	 	,	and	i	 beg 	 an 	 	a	 care 	 er 	 	 a 	 s 	 	--	in	my	own	business	.
and	first	i	was	 praise 	 d 	 	for	it	,	then	 critic 	 ized 	 	for	it	,	but	the	fact	of	the	matter	was	,	i	had	 be 	 come 	 	solemn	.
i	did	n't	do	what	i	think	was	a	piece	of	serious	work	 aga 	 in 	 	for	about	14	 year 	 s 	 	.
i	 s 	 pent 	 	most	of	the	'80s	 be 	 ing 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	solemn	,	 turn 	 ing 	 	out	these	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 design 	 s 	 	that	i	was	 expect 	 ed 	 	to	do	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	who	i	was	,	and	i	was	living	in	 th 	 is 	 	cycle	of	going	from	serious	to	solemn	to	hackneyed	to	dead	,	and	 get 	 ting 	 	 re 	 discover 	 ed 	 	all	over	 aga 	 in 	 	.
so	,	here	was	the	second	condition	for	which	i	think	i	 accomplish 	 ed 	 	some	serious	play	.
there	's	a	paul	newman	movie	that	i	love	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	 ver 	 dict 	 	.	``
i	do	n't	know	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	have	 s 	 een 	 	it	,	but	it	's	a	beaut	.
and	in	the	movie	,	he	 play 	 s 	 	a	down	-	and	-	out	lawyer	who	's	 be 	 come 	 	an	 ambul 	 ance 	 	chaser	.
and	he	's	taken	on	--	he	's	 give 	 n 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	a	 mal 	 practice 	 	suit	to	handle	that	's	sort	of	an	easy	deal	,	and	in	the	 mid 	 st 	 	of	 try 	 ing 	 	to	connect	the	deal	,	he	 start 	 s 	 	to	 empath 	 ize 	 	and	identify	with	his	client	,	and	he	 regain 	 s 	 	his	 moral 	 ity 	 	and	purpose	,	and	he	 go 	 es 	 	on	to	win	the	case	.
and	in	the	depth	of	despair	,	in	the	 mid 	 st 	 	of	the	movie	,	when	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	he	ca	n't	pull	 th 	 is 	 	thing	off	,	and	he	 need 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	he	 need 	 s 	 	to	win	 th 	 is 	 	case	so	 bad 	 ly 	 	.	there	's	a	shot	of	paul	newman	 al 	 one 	 	,	in	his	 off 	 ice 	 	,	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	case	.	there	are	no	other	 case 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	case	.	there	are	no	other	 case 	 s 	 	.	``
and	in	that	moment	of	 desir 	 e 	 	and	focus	,	he	can	win	.
and	that	is	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	position	to	be	in	to	create	some	serious	play	.
and	i	had	that	moment	in	1994	when	i	met	a	theater	director	named	george	wolfe	,	who	was	going	to	have	me	design	an	 ident 	 ity 	 	for	the	new	york	shakespeare	 fest 	 ival 	 	,	then	known	,	and	then	 be 	 came 	 	the	public	theater	.
and	i	 beg 	 an 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 immers 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	project	in	a	way	i	never	was	before	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	theater	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	like	at	that	time	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	was	in	the	 news 	 paper 	 s 	 	and	in	the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	sort	of	a	comment	on	the	time	.
and	the	public	theater	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	much	better	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	than	 th 	 is 	 	.
they	had	no	logo	and	no	 ident 	 ity 	 	,	but	they	had	these	 ver 	 y 	 	 icon 	 ic 	 	 post 	 ers 	 	 paint 	 ed 	 	by	paul	davis	.
and	george	wolf	had	taken	over	from	 an 	 other 	 	director	and	he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	change	the	theater	,	and	he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	make	it	urban	and	loud	and	a	place	that	was	inclusive	.
so	,	 draw 	 ing 	 	on	my	love	of	 typo 	 graphy 	 	,	i	 immers 	 ed 	 	 my 	 self 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	project	.
and	what	was	different	about	it	was	the	 total 	 ity 	 	of	it	,	was	that	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 be 	 came 	 	the	voice	,	the	visual	voice	,	of	a	place	in	a	way	i	had	never	 d 	 one 	 	before	,	where	every	 a 	 spect 	 	--	the	 small 	 est 	 	ad	,	the	ticket	,	 what 	 ever 	 	it	was	--	was	designed	by	me	.
there	was	no	format	.
there	was	no	in	-	house	 depart 	 ment 	 	that	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 push 	 ed 	 	to	.
i	 liter 	 ally 	 	for	three	 year 	 s 	 	made	 every 	 thing 	 	--	every	scrap	of	paper	,	 every 	 thing 	 	 on 	 line 	 	,	that	 th 	 is 	 	theater	did	.
and	it	was	the	 on 	 ly 	 	job	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	other	 job 	 s 	 	.	i	lived	and	 breath 	 ed 	 	it	in	a	way	i	have	n't	with	a	client	since	.
it	enabled	me	to	 re 	 ally 	 	express	 my 	 self 	 	and	grow	.
and	i	think	that	you	know	when	you	're	going	to	be	 give 	 n 	 	 th 	 is 	 	position	,	and	it	's	rare	,	but	when	you	get	it	and	you	have	 th 	 is 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	,	it	's	the	moment	of	serious	play	.
i	did	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	i	still	do	them	.
i	still	work	for	the	public	theater	.
i	'm	on	 the 	 ir 	 	board	,	and	i	still	am	 involve 	 d 	 	with	it	.
the	high	point	of	the	public	theater	,	i	think	,	was	in	1996	,	two	 year 	 s 	 	after	i	designed	it	,	which	was	the	``	 br 	 ing 	 	in	'	da	noise	,	 br 	 ing 	 	in	'	da	funk	``	campaign	that	was	all	over	new	york	.
but	 some 	 thing 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	it	,	and	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	it	was	,	it	 be 	 came 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	popular	.
and	that	is	a	kiss	of	death	for	 some 	 thing 	 	serious	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 make 	 s 	 	it	solemn	.
and	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	was	that	new	york	city	,	to	a	degree	,	ate	my	 ident 	 ity 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	people	 beg 	 an 	 	to	copy	it	.
here	's	an	ad	in	the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	 some 	 body 	 	did	for	a	play	 call 	 ed 	 	``	mind	 game 	 s 	 	.	``
then	``	chicago	``	came	out	,	used	similar	 graphic 	 s 	 	,	and	the	public	theater	's	 ident 	 ity 	 	was	just	 total 	 ly 	 	eaten	and	taken	away	,	which	 me 	 ant 	 	i	had	to	change	it	.
so	,	i	 change 	 d 	 	it	so	that	every	season	was	different	,	and	i	 continu 	 ed 	 	to	do	these	 post 	 ers 	 	,	but	they	never	had	the	 serious 	 ness 	 	of	the	first	 ident 	 ity 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	too	individual	,	and	they	did	n't	have	that	heft	of	 every 	 thing 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	the	same	thing	.
now	--	and	i	think	since	the	public	theater	,	i	must	have	 d 	 one 	 	more	than	a	dozen	cultural	 ident 	 ities 	 	for	major	 institution 	 s 	 	,	and	i	do	n't	think	i	ever	--	i	ever	grasped	that	 serious 	 ness 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	--	i	do	them	for	 ver 	 y 	 	big	,	 import 	 ant 	 	 institution 	 s 	 	in	new	york	city	.
the	 institution 	 s 	 	are	solemn	,	and	so	is	the	design	.
they	're	better	 craft 	 ed 	 	than	the	public	theater	was	,	and	they	 s 	 pend 	 	more	money	on	them	,	but	i	think	that	that	moment	 come 	 s 	 	and	 go 	 es 	 	.
the	best	way	to	accomplish	serious	design	--	which	i	think	we	all	have	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	do	--	is	to	be	 total 	 ly 	 	and	 complete 	 ly 	 	unqualified	for	the	job	.
that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	happen	 ver 	 y 	 	often	,	but	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	me	in	the	year	2000	,	when	for	some	reason	or	 an 	 other 	 	,	a	whole	pile	of	different	 architect 	 s 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	to	ask	me	to	design	the	 insid 	 es 	 	of	 theater 	 s 	 	with	them	,	where	i	would	take	 environment 	 al 	 	 graphic 	 s 	 	and	work	them	 in 	 to 	 	 building 	 s 	 	.
i	'd	never	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	work	before	.
i	did	n't	know	how	to	read	an	 architect 	 ural 	 	plan	,	i	did	n't	know	what	they	 we 	 re 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	,	and	i	 re 	 ally 	 	could	n't	handle	the	fact	that	a	job	--	a	single	job	--	could	go	on	for	four	 year 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	used	to	 immedi 	 acy 	 	in	graphic	design	,	and	that	kind	of	attention	to	detail	was	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	for	 some 	 body 	 	like	me	,	with	add	.
so	,	it	was	a	rough	--	it	was	a	rough	go	,	but	i	fell	in	love	with	 th 	 is 	 	process	of	 actual 	 ly 	 	 integ 	 rating 	 	 graphic 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 architect 	 ure 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	did	n't	know	what	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	why	ca	n't	the	 sign 	 age 	 	be	on	the	floor	?	``
new	yorkers	look	at	 the 	 ir 	 	feet	.
and	then	i	found	that	 act 	 ors 	 	and	 actress 	 es 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	take	 the 	 ir 	 	 cue 	 s 	 	from	the	floor	,	so	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	that	these	 sort 	 s 	 	of	sign	 system 	 s 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	to	make	sense	.
they	 integrate 	 d 	 	with	the	building	in	 re 	 ally 	 	peculiar	ways	.
they	ran	around	 corner 	 s 	 	,	they	went	up	 side 	 s 	 	of	 building 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 meld 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 architect 	 ure 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 sym 	 phony 	 	space	on	90th	street	and	broadway	,	and	the	type	is	interwoven	 in 	 to 	 	the	 stain 	 less 	 	steel
and	 back 	 lit 	 	with	fiber	 optic 	 s 	 	.
and	the	architect	,	jim	polshek	,	 essential 	 ly 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	me	a	canvas	to	play	 typo 	 graphy 	 	out	on	.
and	it	was	serious	play	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	children	's	museum	in	pittsburgh	,	pennsylvania	,	made	out	of	 complete 	 ly 	 	 in 	 expensive 	 	 material 	 s 	 	.
extruded	 typo 	 graphy 	 	that	's	 back 	 lit 	 	with	 ne 	 on 	 	.
 thing 	 s 	 	i	never	did	before	,	built	before	.
i	just	thought	they	'd	be	kind	of	 f 	 un 	 	to	do	.
 donor 	 s 	 	'	 wall 	 s 	 	made	out	of	lucite	.
and	then	,	 in 	 expensive 	 	 sign 	 age 	 	.
i	think	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	of	these	was	 th 	 is 	 	little	job	in	newark	,	new	jersey	.
it	's	a	 perform 	 ing 	 	 art 	 s 	 	school	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	building	that	--	they	had	no	money	,	and	they	had	to	recast	it	,	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	if	we	give	you	100,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	what	can	you	do	with	it	?
and	i	did	a	little	photoshop	job	on	it	,	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	well	,	i	think	we	can	paint	it	.
and	we	did	.	and	it	was	play	.
and	there	's	the	building	.	 every 	 thing 	 	was	 paint 	 ed 	 	--	 typo 	 graphy 	 	over	the	whole	damn	thing	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	the	air	 condition 	 ing 	 	 duct 	 s 	 	.
i	 hire 	 d 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	who	paint	 flat 	 s 	 	 fix 	 ed 	 	on	the	 side 	 s 	 	of	 gar 	 age 	 s 	 	to	do	the	 paint 	 ing 	 	on	the	building	,	and	they	 love 	 d 	 	it	.
they	got	 in 	 to 	 	it	--	they	took	the	job	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 serious 	 ly 	 	.
they	used	to	climb	up	on	the	building	and	call	me	and	tell	me	that	they	had	to	correct	my	 typo 	 graphy 	 	--	that	my	 s 	 pac 	 ing 	 	was	wrong	,	and	they	 move 	 d 	 	it	,	and	they	did	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	with	it	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	serious	,	too	.	it	was	 quit 	 e 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	.
by	the	time	i	did	bloomberg	's	 head 	 quarter 	 s 	 	my	work	had	 beg 	 un 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	 accept 	 ed 	 	.
people	 want 	 ed 	 	it	in	big	,	expensive	 place 	 s 	 	.
and	that	 beg 	 an 	 	to	make	it	solemn	.
bloomberg	was	all	about	 number 	 s 	 	,	and	we	did	big	 number 	 s 	 	through	the	space	and	the	 number 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 project 	 ed 	 	on	a	spectacular	led	that	my	partner	,	lisa	strausfeld	,	 programm 	 ed 	 	.
but	it	 be 	 came 	 	the	end	of	the	 serious 	 ness 	 	of	the	play	,	and	it	 start 	 ed 	 	to	,	once	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 be 	 come 	 	solemn	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	current	project	in	pittsburgh	,	pennsylvania	,	where	i	got	to	be	 goof 	 y 	 	.
i	was	 invit 	 ed 	 	to	design	a	logo	for	 th 	 is 	 	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	,	 call 	 ed 	 	the	north	side	,	and	i	thought	it	was	 s 	 il 	 ly 	 	for	a	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	to	have	a	logo	.
i	think	that	's	 ra 	 ther 	 	 creep 	 y 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	.	why	would	a	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	have	a	logo	?
a	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	thing	--	it	's	got	a	 land 	 mark 	 	,	it	's	got	a	place	,	it	's	got	a	restaurant	.	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	a	logo	.	i	mean	,	what	would	that	be	?
so	i	had	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	give	a	 present 	 ation 	 	to	a	city	council	and	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	 constit 	 uent 	 s 	 	,	and	i	went	to	pittsburgh	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	,	 re 	 ally 	 	what	you	have	here	are	all	these	underpasses	that	 separat 	 e 	 	the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	from	the	center	of	town	.
why	do	n't	you	 celebr 	 ate 	 	them	,	and	make	the	underpasses	landmarks	?	``
so	i	 beg 	 an 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	crazy	 present 	 ation 	 	of	these	 install 	 ations 	 	--	potential	 install 	 ations 	 	--	on	these	underpass	 bridge 	 s 	 	,	and	stood	up	in	front	of	the	city	council	--	and	was	a	little	bit	 scar 	 ed 	 	,	i	have	to	admit	.
but	i	was	so	 utter 	 ly 	 	unqualified	for	 th 	 is 	 	project	,	and	so	 utter 	 ly 	 	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	,	and	 ignor 	 ed 	 	the	brief	so	 desperate 	 ly 	 	that	i	think	they	just	 embrace 	 d 	 	it	with	wholeheartedness	,	just	 complete 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	so	 goof 	 y 	 	to	begin	with	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	bridge	they	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 	up	and	 pre 	 par 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	speak	.
it	will	change	every	six	 month 	 s 	 	,	and	it	will	 be 	 come 	 	an	art	 install 	 ation 	 	in	the	north	side	of	pittsburgh	,	and	it	will	 prob 	 ably 	 	 be 	 come 	 	a	 land 	 mark 	 	in	the	area	.
john	hockenberry	told	you	a	bit	about	my	travail	with	citibank	,	that	is	now	a	10	-	year	relationship	,	and	i	still	work	with	them	.
and	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	am	 amuse 	 d 	 	by	them	and	like	them	,	and	think	that	 a 	 s 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	big	corporation	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	keep	 the 	 ir 	 	 graphic 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	nice	.
i	drew	the	logo	for	citibank	on	a	napkin	in	the	first	 meet 	 ing 	 	.
that	was	the	play	part	of	the	job	.
and	then	i	 s 	 pent 	 	a	year	going	to	long	,	 ted 	 ious 	 	,	 bor 	 ing 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	sell	 th 	 is 	 	logo	through	to	a	huge	corporation	to	the	point	of	 tear 	 s 	 	.
i	thought	i	was	going	to	go	crazy	at	the	end	of	 th 	 is 	 	year	.
we	made	idiotic	 present 	 ations 	 	 show 	 ing 	 	how	the	citi	logo	made	sense	,	and	how	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	derived	from	an	 um 	 br 	 ella 	 	,	and	we	made	 anim 	 ations 	 	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	we	came	back	and	forth	and	back	and	forth	and	back	and	forth	.
and	it	was	worth	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 b 	 ought 	 	 th 	 is 	 	thing	,	and	it	 play 	 ed 	 	out	on	 s 	 uch 	 	a	grand	scale	,	and	it	's	so	 inter 	 national 	 ly 	 	 recogn 	 izable 	 	,	but	for	me	it	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 depress 	 ing 	 	year	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	matter	of	fact	,	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	never	 b 	 ought 	 	onto	the	logo	 un 	 til 	 	fallon	put	it	on	 it 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	good	``	live	richly	``	campaign	,	and	then	 every 	 body 	 	 accept 	 ed 	 	it	all	over	the	world	.
so	 dur 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	time	i	 need 	 ed 	 	some	kind	of	 counter 	 balance 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	crazy	,	crazy	 exist 	 ence 	 	of	going	to	these	long	,	idiotic	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
and	i	was	up	in	my	country	house	,	and	for	some	reason	,	i	 beg 	 an 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 	these	 ver 	 y 	 	big	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	,	 labor 	 ious 	 	,	 complic 	 ated 	 	 map 	 s 	 	of	the	entire	world	,	and	 list 	 ing 	 	every	place	on	the	planet	,	and	 put 	 ting 	 	them	in	,	and	 mis 	 spell 	 ing 	 	them	,	and	 put 	 ting 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	in	the	wrong	spot	,	and	 complete 	 ly 	 	 controll 	 ing 	 	the	information	,	and	going	 total 	 ly 	 	and	 complete 	 ly 	 	nuts	with	it	.
they	would	take	me	about	six	 month 	 s 	 	 initi 	 ally 	 	,	but	then	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	at	it	.
here	's	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
every	single	city	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	is	on	here	.
and	it	hung	for	about	eight	 month 	 s 	 	at	the	cooper	-	hewitt	,	and	people	 walk 	 ed 	 	up	to	it	,	and	they	would	point	to	a	part	of	the	map	and	they	'd	say	,	``	oh	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	here	.	``
and	,	of	course	,	they	could	n't	have	 be 	 en 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	in	the	wrong	spot	.
but	what	i	 like 	 d 	 	about	it	was	,	i	was	 controll 	 ing 	 	my	own	idiotic	information	,	and	i	was	creating	my	own	 pal 	 ette 	 	of	information	,	and	i	was	 total 	 ly 	 	and	 complete 	 ly 	 	at	play	.
one	of	my	 favor 	 ites 	 	was	 th 	 is 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 	i	did	of	florida	after	the	2000	election	that	 ha 	 s 	 	the	election	 result 	 s 	 	 roll 	 ing 	 	around	in	the	water	.
i	keep	that	for	evidence	.
 some 	 body 	 	was	up	at	my	house	and	saw	the	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	 recommend 	 ed 	 	them	to	a	 gall 	 ery 	 	,	and	i	had	a	first	show	about	two	-	and	-	a	-	half	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	i	 show 	 ed 	 	these	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	that	i	'm	 show 	 ing 	 	you	now	.
and	then	a	funny	thing	 happen 	 ed 	 	--	they	 s 	 old 	 	.
and	they	 s 	 old 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	and	 be 	 came 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	popular	.
we	 start 	 ed 	 	making	 print 	 s 	 	from	them	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	manhattan	,	one	from	the	 s 	 eries 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	print	from	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	which	we	did	in	red	,	white	and	blue	.
we	 beg 	 an 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	these	big	silkscreen	 print 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 start 	 ed 	 	selling	,	too	.
so	,	the	 gall 	 ery 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	me	to	have	 an 	 other 	 	show	in	two	 year 	 s 	 	,	which	 me 	 ant 	 	that	i	 re 	 ally 	 	had	to	paint	these	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	much	 fast 	 er 	 	than	i	had	ever	 d 	 one 	 	them	.	and	i	--	they	 start 	 ed 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	more	 politic 	 al 	 	,	and	i	 pick 	 ed 	 	 area 	 s 	 	that	sort	of	 we 	 re 	 	in	the	news	or	that	i	had	some	 feel 	 ing 	 	about	,	and	i	 beg 	 an 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	then	 th 	 is 	 	funny	thing	 happen 	 ed 	 	.	i	found	that	i	was	no	 long 	 er 	 	at	play	.
i	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	solemn	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	of	 fulfill 	 ing 	 	an	 expect 	 ation 	 	for	a	show	,	which	is	not	where	i	 start 	 ed 	 	with	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
so	,	while	they	 be 	 came 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	,	i	know	how	to	make	them	,	so	i	'm	not	a	neophyte	,	and	they	're	no	 long 	 er 	 	serious	--	they	have	 be 	 come 	 	solemn	.
and	that	's	a	 terrify 	 ing 	 	factor	--	when	you	start	 some 	 thing 	 	and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	that	way	--	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	all	that	's	left	for	you	is	to	go	back	and	to	find	out	what	the	next	thing	is	that	you	can	push	,	that	you	can	invent	,	that	you	can	be	 ignor 	 ant 	 	about	,
that	you	can	be	 arrog 	 ant 	 	about	,	that	you	can	fail	with	,	and	that	you	can	be	a	fool	with	.
 be 	 cause 	 	in	the	end	,	that	's	how	you	grow	,	and	that	's	all	that	 matter 	 s 	 	.
so	,	i	'm	 plug 	 ging 	 	 a 	 long 	 	here	--	and	i	'm	just	going	to	have	to	blow	up	the	 stair 	 case 	 	.
