 a 	 s 	 	a	boy	,	i	 love 	 d 	 	 car 	 s 	 	.
when	i	 turn 	 ed 	 	18	,	i	lost	my	best	friend	to	a	car	accident	.
like	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	then	i	 decide 	 d 	 	i	'd	dedicate	my	life	to	saving	one	million	people	every	year	.
now	i	have	n't	 succeed 	 ed 	 	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	a	progress	report	,	but	i	'm	here	to	tell	you	a	little	bit	about	self	-	 driv 	 ing 	 	 car 	 s 	 	.
i	saw	the	 con 	 cept 	 	first	in	the	darpa	grand	 challeng 	 es 	 	where	the	u.s.	government	 issue 	 d 	 	a	prize	to	build	a	self	-	 driv 	 ing 	 	car	that	could	 navig 	 ate 	 	a	desert	.
and	even	 th 	 ough 	 	a	hundred	 team 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	there	,	these	 car 	 s 	 	went	 no 	 where 	 	.
so	we	 decide 	 d 	 	at	stanford	to	build	a	different	self	-	 driv 	 ing 	 	car	.
we	built	the	 hard 	 ware 	 	and	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	.
we	made	it	learn	from	us	,	and	we	set	it	free	in	the	desert	.
and	the	 un 	 imagin 	 able 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	:	it	 be 	 came 	 	the	first	car	to	ever	return	from	a	darpa	grand	 challeng 	 e 	 	,	winning	stanford	2	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
yet	i	still	had	n't	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	a	single	life	.
since	,	our	work	 ha 	 s 	 	focused	on	building	 driv 	 ing 	 	 car 	 s 	 	that	can	drive	 any 	 where 	 	by	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	--	any	street	in	california	.
we	've	driven	140,000	 mile 	 s 	 	.
our	 car 	 s 	 	have	 sensor 	 s 	 	by	which	they	 magic 	 ally 	 	can	see	 every 	 thing 	 	around	them	and	make	 decision 	 s 	 	about	every	 a 	 spect 	 	of	 driv 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	the	perfect	 driv 	 ing 	 	 mechan 	 ism 	 	.
we	've	driven	in	cities	,	like	in	san	francisco	here	.
we	've	driven	from	san	francisco	to	los	angeles	on	 high 	 way 	 	1	.
we	've	 en 	 counter 	 ed 	 	 jog 	 gers 	 	,	 bus 	 y 	 	 high 	 ways 	 	,	toll	 booth 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 with 	 out 	 	a	person	in	the	loop	;	the	car	just	 drive 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	.
in	fact	,	while	we	drove	140,000	 mile 	 s 	 	,	people	did	n't	even	notice	.
mountain	 road 	 s 	 	,	day	and	night	,	and	even	 crook 	 ed 	 	lombard	street	in	san	francisco	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	our	 car 	 s 	 	get	so	crazy	,	they	even	do	little	 stunt 	 s 	 	.
man	:	oh	,	my	god	.	what	?
second	man	:	it	's	 driv 	 ing 	 	 it 	 self 	 	.
sebastian	thrun	:	now	i	ca	n't	get	my	friend	harold	back	to	life	,
but	i	can	do	 some 	 thing 	 	for	all	the	people	who	 di 	 ed 	 	.
do	you	know	that	 driv 	 ing 	 	 accident 	 s 	 	are	the	number	one	cause	of	death	for	young	people	?
and	do	you	 real 	 ize 	 	that	 al 	 most 	 	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	are	due	to	human	error	and	not	machine	error	,	and	can	 there 	 fore 	 	be	 prevent 	 ed 	 	by	 machine 	 s 	 	?
do	you	 real 	 ize 	 	that	we	could	change	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	of	 high 	 ways 	 	by	a	factor	of	two	or	three	if	we	did	n't	 re 	 ly 	 	on	human	 pre 	 cis 	 ion 	 	on	 stay 	 ing 	 	in	the	lane	--	improve	body	position	and	 there 	 fore 	 	drive	a	little	bit	 close 	 r 	 	together	on	a	little	bit	 narrow 	 er 	 	 lane 	 s 	 	,	and	do	away	with	all	traffic	 jam 	 s 	 	on	 high 	 ways 	 	?
do	you	 real 	 ize 	 	that	you	,	ted	 user 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 pend 	 	an	average	of	52	 minute 	 s 	 	per	day	in	traffic	,	 was 	 ting 	 	your	time	on	your	 dai 	 ly 	 	commute	?
you	could	regain	 th 	 is 	 	time	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	four	billion	 hour 	 s 	 	 waste 	 d 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	 al 	 one 	 	.
and	it	's	2.4	billion	 gallon 	 s 	 	of	 gas 	 o 	 line 	 	 waste 	 d 	 	.
now	i	think	there	's	a	vision	here	,	a	new	technology	,	and	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	looking	forward	to	a	time	when	 generation 	 s 	 	after	us	look	back	at	us	and	say	how	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	it	was	that	 human 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 driv 	 ing 	 	 car 	 s 	 	.
thank	you	.
