brain	magic	.	what	's	brain	magic	all	about	?
brain	magic	to	me	 indic 	 ates 	 	that	area	of	magic	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	 psycho 	 logical 	 	and	mind	-	 read 	 ing 	 	 effect 	 s 	 	.
so	 un 	 like 	 	 tradition 	 al 	 	magic	,	it	uses	the	power	of	 word 	 s 	 	,	 linguist 	 ic 	 	 de 	 ception 	 	,	non	-	verbal	communication	and	 vari 	 ous 	 	other	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	to	create	the	illusion	of	a	sixth	sense	.
now	,	i	'm	going	to	show	you	all	how	easy	it	is	to	 manipul 	 ate 	 	the	human	mind	once	you	know	how	.
and	i	want	 every 	 body 	 	 down 	 stair 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	to	join	in	with	me	and	 every 	 body 	 	here	.
i	want	 every 	 body 	 	to	put	out	your	 hand 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	for	me	,	first	of	all	.
ok	,	clap	them	together	,	once	.
ok	,	reverse	your	 hand 	 s 	 	.
now	,	follow	my	 action 	 s 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	.
now	about	half	the	audience	 ha 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	left	hand	up	.	why	is	that	?
ok	,	swap	them	around	,	put	your	right	hand	up	.
ok	,	now	,	cross	your	 hand 	 s 	 	over	,	so	your	right	hand	 go 	 es 	 	over	,	 inter 	 lace 	 	your	 finger 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	then	make	 s 	 ure 	 	your	right	thumb	is	 out 	 side 	 	your	left	thumb	--	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
 your 	 s 	 	is	the	other	way	around	,	so	swap	it	around	.
 excel 	 lent 	 	,	ok	.	extend	your	 finger 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	for	me	.
all	right	.	tap	them	together	once	.
ok	,	now	,	if	you	did	not	allow	me	to	deceive	your	 mind 	 s 	 	,	you	would	all	be	able	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	,	now	you	can	see	how	easy	it	is	for	me	to	 manipul 	 ate 	 	the	human	mind	,	once	you	know	how	.
now	,	i	remember	when	i	was	about	15	,	i	read	a	copy	of	life	magazine	,	which	 detail 	 ed 	 	a	story	about	a	75	-	year	-	old	blind	russian	woman	who	could	sense	 print 	 ed 	 	 letter 	 s 	 	--	there	's	still	people	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	it	here	--	--	who	could	sense	 print 	 ed 	 	 letter 	 s 	 	and	even	sense	 color 	 s 	 	,	just	by	touch	.
and	she	was	 complete 	 ly 	 	blind	.
she	could	 al 	 so 	 	read	the	 s 	 erial 	 	 number 	 s 	 	on	 bill 	 s 	 	when	they	 we 	 re 	 	 place 	 d 	 	,	face	down	,	on	a	hard	surface	.
now	,	i	was	 fascinate 	 d 	 	,	but	at	the	same	time	,	 skeptic 	 al 	 	.
how	could	 some 	 body 	 	read	using	 the 	 ir 	 	 finger 	 tip 	 s 	 	?
you	know	,	if	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	think	about	it	,	if	 some 	 body 	 	is	 total 	 ly 	 	blind	--	a	guy	 yester 	 day 	 	did	a	 demonst 	 ration 	 	in	one	of	the	rooms	,	where	people	had	to	close	 the 	 ir 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	and	they	could	just	hear	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	just	a	 re 	 ally 	 	weird	thing	to	try	and	figure	out	.	how	could	 some 	 body 	 	read	using	 the 	 ir 	 	 finger 	 tip 	 s 	 	?
now	 ear 	 lier 	 	on	,	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	a	tv	show	that	i	have	coming	up	on	mtv	,	i	 attempt 	 ed 	 	to	give	a	similar	 demonst 	 ration 	 	of	what	is	now	known	 a 	 s 	 	second	sight	.
