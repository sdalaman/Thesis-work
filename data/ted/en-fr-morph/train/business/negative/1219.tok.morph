hi	 every 	 one 	 	.
i	'm	an	artist	and	a	dad	--	second	time	around	.
thank	you	.
and	i	want	to	share	with	you	my	 lat 	 est 	 	art	project	.
it	's	a	children	's	book	for	the	ipad	.
it	's	a	little	 quirk 	 y 	 	and	 s 	 il 	 ly 	 	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	pop	-	it	,	``	and	it	's	about	the	 thing 	 s 	 	little	 kid 	 s 	 	do	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	about	 pot 	 ty 	 	training	--	 a 	 s 	 	most	of	you	,	i	hope	,	know	.
you	can	tickle	the	rug	.
you	can	make	the	baby	poop	.
you	can	do	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 f 	 un 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
you	can	burst	 bubble 	 s 	 	.
you	can	draw	,	 a 	 s 	 	 every 	 one 	 	should	.
but	you	know	,	i	have	a	problem	with	children	's	 book 	 s 	 	:	i	think	they	're	full	of	 propag 	 and 	 a 	 	.
at	 l 	 east 	 	an	indian	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	one	of	these	american	 book 	 s 	 	in	park	 slop 	 e 	 	,	forget	it	.
it	's	not	the	way	i	was	 br 	 ought 	 	up	.
so	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'm	going	to	counter	 th 	 is 	 	with	my	own	 propag 	 and 	 a 	 	.	``	if	you	notice	 care 	 fully 	 	,	it	's	a	 homo 	 sexual 	 	couple	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	up	a	child	.
you	do	n't	like	it	?
shake	it	,	and	you	have	a	lesbian	couple	.
shake	it	,	and	you	have	a	 hetero 	 sexual 	 	couple	.
you	know	,	i	do	n't	even	 believ 	 e 	 	in	the	 con 	 cept 	 	of	an	ideal	family	.
i	have	to	tell	you	about	my	 child 	 hood 	 	.
i	went	to	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	proper	christian	school	taught	by	 n 	 un 	 s 	 	,	 father 	 s 	 	,	 brother 	 s 	 	,	 sister 	 s 	 	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	,	i	was	 br 	 ought 	 	up	to	be	a	good	samaritan	,	and	i	am	.
and	i	'd	go	at	the	end	of	the	day	to	a	 tradition 	 al 	 	hindu	house	,	which	was	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	 on 	 ly 	 	hindu	house	in	a	 pre 	 domin 	 ant 	 ly 	 	islamic	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	,	i	 celebr 	 ated 	 	every	religious	function	.
in	fact	,	when	there	was	a	 wed 	 d 	 ing 	 	in	our	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	,	all	of	us	would	paint	our	 house 	 s 	 	for	the	 wed 	 d 	 ing 	 	.
i	remember	we	 cri 	 ed 	 	 pro 	 fuse 	 ly 	 	when	the	little	 goat 	 s 	 	we	 play 	 ed 	 	with	in	the	summer	 be 	 came 	 	biriani	.
we	all	had	to	fast	 dur 	 ing 	 	ramadan	.
it	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	time	.
but	i	must	say	,	i	'll	never	forget	,	when	i	was	13	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
babri	masjid	--	one	of	the	most	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 mosque 	 s 	 	in	india	,	built	by	king	babur	,	i	think	,	in	the	16th	century	--	was	 demolish 	 ed 	 	by	hindu	 activist 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 caus 	 ed 	 	major	 riot 	 s 	 	in	my	city	.
and	for	the	first	time	,	i	was	 affect 	 ed 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	 commun 	 al 	 	 un 	 rest 	 	.
my	little	five	-	year	-	old	kid	neighbor	 come 	 s 	 	running	in	,	and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 rag 	 s 	 	,	 rag 	 s 	 	.
you	know	the	hindus	are	 kill 	 ing 	 	us	muslims	.	be	 care 	 ful 	 	.	``	i	'm	like	,	``	 du 	 de 	 	,	i	'm	hindu	.	``	he	's	like	,	``	huh	!	``	you	know	,	my	work	is	inspired	by	 event 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
even	in	my	 gall 	 ery 	 	 show 	 s 	 	,	i	try	and	 re 	 visit 	 	historic	 event 	 s 	 	like	babri	masjid	,	distill	 on 	 ly 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 emotion 	 al 	 	residue	and	image	my	own	life	.
imagine	 histo 	 ry 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	taught	 different 	 ly 	 	.
remember	that	children	's	book	where	you	shake	and	the	 sexual 	 ity 	 	of	the	 parent 	 s 	 	change	?
i	have	 an 	 other 	 	idea	.
it	's	a	children	's	book	about	indian	 in 	 depend 	 ence 	 	--	 ver 	 y 	 	 patriot 	 ic 	 	.
but	when	you	shake	it	,	you	get	pakistan	's	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	.
shake	it	 aga 	 in 	 	,	and	you	get	the	british	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	.
you	have	to	 separat 	 e 	 	fact	from	bias	,	right	.
even	my	 book 	 s 	 	on	children	have	cute	,	 fuzz 	 y 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	.
but	they	're	 play 	 ing 	 	 geo 	 politic 	 s 	 	.
they	're	 play 	 ing 	 	out	israel	-	palestine	,	india	-	pakistan	.
you	know	,	i	'm	making	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	argument	.
and	my	argument	[	is	]	that	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	for	us	to	teach	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	is	by	 teach 	 ing 	 	children	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 s 	 	at	the	 ear 	 liest 	 	stage	.
after	all	,	children	's	 book 	 s 	 	are	 manual 	 s 	 	on	 parent 	 ing 	 	,	so	you	better	give	them	children	's	 book 	 s 	 	that	teach	them	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 s 	 	.
and	 con 	 verse 	 ly 	 	,	 on 	 ly 	 	when	you	teach	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 s 	 	will	a	child	be	able	to	imagine	and	put	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	the	 shoe 	 s 	 	of	 some 	 one 	 	who	is	different	from	them	.
i	'm	making	an	argument	that	art	and	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	essential	 tool 	 s 	 	in	 empath 	 y 	 	.
you	know	,	i	ca	n't	promise	my	child	a	life	 with 	 out 	 	bias	--	we	're	all	 bias 	 ed 	 	--	but	i	promise	to	bias	my	child	with	 multi 	 ple 	 	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 s 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
