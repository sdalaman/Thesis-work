i	would	like	to	talk	to	you	about	why	 man 	 y 	 	e-health	 project 	 s 	 	fail	.
and	i	 re 	 ally 	 	think	that	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	of	it	is	that	we	 stop 	 ped 	 	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	 patient 	 s 	 	.
and	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	did	at	_UNK_	university	is	we	 ap 	 point 	 ed 	 	a	chief	 listen 	 ing 	 	officer	.
not	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	scientific	way	--	she	 put 	 s 	 	up	a	little	cup	of	coffee	or	cup	of	tea	and	 ask 	 s 	 	 patient 	 s 	 	,	family	,	 relat 	 ive 	 s 	 	,	``	what	's	up	?
how	could	we	help	you	?	``	and	we	think	,	we	like	to	think	,	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	major	 problem 	 s 	 	why	all	--	 may 	 be 	 	not	all	--	but	most	of	the	e-health	 project 	 s 	 	fail	,	since	we	 stop 	 ped 	 	 listen 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	my	wifi	scale	.	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	thing	.
it	's	got	one	knob	,	on	/	off	.
and	every	 morn 	 ing 	 	i	hop	on	it	.
and	 y 	 es 	 	,	i	've	got	a	 challeng 	 e 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	might	see	.
and	i	put	my	 challeng 	 e 	 	on	95	 k 	 g 	 	.
but	the	thing	is	that	it	's	made	 th 	 is 	 	simple	that	 when 	 ever 	 	i	hop	on	,	it	 s 	 end 	 s 	 	my	data	through	google	health	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
and	it	's	 collect 	 ed 	 	by	my	general	practitioner	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	so	he	can	see	what	's	my	problem	in	weight	,	not	on	the	 ver 	 y 	 	moment	that	i	need	_UNK_	support	or	 some 	 thing 	 	like	it	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	looking	 back 	 ward 	 	.
but	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	thing	.
 a 	 s 	 	some	of	you	might	know	,	i	've	got	more	than	4,000	 follow 	 ers 	 	on	twitter	.
so	every	 morn 	 ing 	 	i	hop	on	my	wifi	scale	and	before	i	'm	in	my	car	,	people	start	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	me	,	``	i	think	you	need	a	light	lunch	 to 	 day 	 	,	lucien	.	``	but	that	's	the	 nic 	 est 	 	thing	that	could	happen	,	since	 th 	 is 	 	is	peer	pressure	,	peer	pressure	used	to	help	 patient 	 s 	 	--	since	 th 	 is 	 	could	be	used	for	 obes 	 ity 	 	,	it	could	be	used	to	stop	 smok 	 ing 	 	in	 patient 	 s 	 	.
but	on	the	other	hand	,	it	 al 	 so 	 	could	be	used	to	get	people	from	out	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 chair 	 s 	 	and	try	to	work	together	in	some	kind	of	 gam 	 ing 	 	activity	to	get	more	control	of	 the 	 ir 	 	health	.
 a 	 s 	 	of	next	week	,	it	will	soon	be	 avail 	 able 	 	.
there	will	be	 th 	 is 	 	little	blood	pressure	meter	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	an	iphone	or	 some 	 thing 	 	or	other	.
and	people	will	be	able	,	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 home 	 s 	 	,	to	take	 the 	 ir 	 	blood	pressure	,	 s 	 end 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	doctor	and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	share	it	with	 other 	 s 	 	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	for	over	a	hundred	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	point	where	 patient 	 s 	 	get	 in 	 to 	 	position	and	can	collect	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	control	 aga 	 in 	 	,	be	 cap 	 tain 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	ship	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	can	help	us	in	health	care	due	to	the	 challeng 	 es 	 	that	we	face	,	like	health	care	cost	explosion	,	 double 	 d 	 	demand	and	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	.
make	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	that	are	easy	to	use	and	start	with	 th 	 is 	 	to	embrace	 patient 	 s 	 	in	the	team	.
and	you	can	do	 th 	 is 	 	with	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	by	crowd	-	sourcing	.
and	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	did	i	would	like	to	share	with	you	 introduc 	 ed 	 	by	a	little	video	.
we	've	all	got	 navig 	 ation 	 	 control 	 s 	 	in	our	car	.
we	 may 	 be 	 	even	[	have	]	it	in	our	 cell 	 phone 	 	.
we	know	 perfect 	 ly 	 	where	all	the	atms	are	about	the	city	of	maastricht	.
the	other	thing	is	we	know	where	all	the	gas	 station 	 s 	 	are	.
and	 s 	 ure 	 	,	we	could	find	fast	food	 chain 	 s 	 	.
but	where	would	be	the	 near 	 est 	 	aed	to	help	 th 	 is 	 	patient	?
we	 ask 	 ed 	 	around	and	 no 	 body 	 	 k 	 new 	 	.
 no 	 body 	 	 k 	 new 	 	where	the	 near 	 est 	 	life	-	saving	aed	was	to	be	 obtain 	 ed 	 	right	now	.
so	what	we	did	,	we	 crowd 	 sourced 	 	the	netherlands	.
we	set	up	a	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	and	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	crowd	,	``	if	you	see	an	aed	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	submit	it	,	tell	us	where	it	is	,	tell	us	when	it	's	open	,	``	since	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	in	 off 	 ice 	 	 hour 	 s 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	it	's	closed	,	of	course	.
and	over	10,000	aeds	 al 	 ready 	 	in	the	netherlands	 al 	 ready 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 submit 	 ted 	 	.
the	next	step	we	took	was	to	find	the	 application 	 s 	 	for	it	.
and	we	built	an	ipad	application	.
we	made	an	application	for	_UNK_	,	 augment 	 ed 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	,	to	find	these	aeds	.
and	 when 	 ever 	 	you	are	in	a	city	like	maastricht	and	 some 	 body 	 	 collapse 	 s 	 	,	you	can	use	your	iphone	,	and	 with 	 in 	 	the	next	 week 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	run	your	 micro 	 soft 	 	 cell 	 phone 	 	,	to	find	the	 near 	 est 	 	aed	which	can	 s 	 ave 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	of	 to 	 day 	 	,	we	would	like	to	 introduc 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	aed	_UNK_	,	which	is	what	the	product	is	 call 	 ed 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	aed	_UNK_	.
and	we	would	like	to	start	 th 	 is 	 	on	a	 world 	 wide 	 	level	.
and	[	we	're	]	 ask 	 ing 	 	all	of	our	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	in	the	rest	of	the	world	,	 col 	 league 	 	 un 	 ive 	 rs 	 ities 	 	,	to	help	us	to	find	and	work	and	act	like	a	hub	to	crowd	-	source	all	these	aeds	all	around	the	world	.
that	 when 	 ever 	 	you	're	on	 holi 	 day 	 	and	 some 	 body 	 	 collapse 	 s 	 	,	might	it	be	your	own	 relat 	 ive 	 	or	 some 	 one 	 	just	in	front	of	you	,	you	can	find	 th 	 is 	 	.
the	other	thing	we	would	like	to	ask	is	of	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	 al 	 so 	 	all	over	the	world	that	will	be	able	to	help	us	_UNK_	these	aeds	.
these	might	be	 cou 	 rier 	 	 service 	 s 	 	or	cable	 guy 	 s 	 	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	just	to	see	 whet 	 her 	 	the	aed	that	's	 submit 	 ted 	 	still	is	in	place	.
so	 pleas 	 e 	 	help	us	on	 th 	 is 	 	one	and	try	to	make	not	 on 	 ly 	 	health	a	little	bit	better	,	but	take	control	of	it	.
thank	you	.
