i	have	the	answer	to	a	question	that	we	've	all	 ask 	 ed 	 	.
the	question	is	,	why	is	it	that	the	letter	x	 represent 	 s 	 	the	 un 	 known 	 	?
now	i	know	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	in	math	class	,	but	now	it	's	 every 	 where 	 	in	the	culture	--
the	x	prize	,	the	x	-	 file 	 s 	 	,	project	x	,	 ted 	 x 	 	.
where	'd	that	come	from	?
about	six	 year 	 s 	 	ago	i	 decide 	 d 	 	that	i	would	learn	arabic	,	which	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	be	a	 suprem 	 e 	 ly 	 	logical	language	.
to	write	a	word	or	a	phrase	or	a	sentence	in	arabic	is	like	 craft 	 ing 	 	an	 equ 	 ation 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	every	part	is	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	precise	and	 car 	 ries 	 	a	lot	of	information	.
that	's	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	so	much	of	what	we	've	come	to	think	of	 a 	 s 	 	western	science	and	 mathematic 	 s 	 	and	 engineer 	 ing 	 	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	out	in	the	first	few	centuries	of	the	common	era	by	the	persians	and	the	arabs	and	the	turks	.
 th 	 is 	 	 include 	 s 	 	the	little	system	in	arabic	 call 	 ed 	 	 al 	 - 	 jebr 	 a 	 	.
and	 al 	 - 	 jebr 	 	 rough 	 ly 	 	 transl 	 ates 	 	to	``	the	system	for	 reconcili 	 ng 	 	disparate	 part 	 s 	 	.	``
 al 	 - 	 jebr 	 	 final 	 ly 	 	came	 in 	 to 	 	english	 a 	 s 	 	algebra	.
one	 ex 	 ample 	 	among	 man 	 y 	 	.
the	arabic	 text 	 s 	 	 contain 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 wis 	 dom 	 	 final 	 ly 	 	made	 the 	 ir 	 	way	to	europe	--	which	is	to	say	spain	--	in	the	11th	and	12th	centuries	.
and	when	they	 arriv 	 ed 	 	there	was	tremendous	interest	in	 transl 	 ating 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 wis 	 dom 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	european	language	.
but	there	 we 	 re 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	.
one	problem	is	there	are	some	 sound 	 s 	 	in	arabic	that	just	do	n't	make	it	through	a	european	voice	box	 with 	 out 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	practice	.
trust	me	on	that	one	.
 al 	 so 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 sound 	 s 	 	tend	not	to	be	 represent 	 ed 	 	by	the	 character 	 s 	 	that	are	 avail 	 able 	 	in	european	 language 	 s 	 	.
here	's	one	of	the	 culprit 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	letter	 she 	 en 	 	,	and	it	 make 	 s 	 	the	sound	we	think	of	 a 	 s 	 	sh	--	``	sh.	``
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	letter	of	the	word	 sha 	 lan 	 	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	``	 some 	 thing 	 	``	just	like	the	the	english	word	``	 some 	 thing 	 	``	--	some	 un 	 defined 	 	,	 un 	 known 	 	thing	.
now	in	arabic	,	we	can	make	 th 	 is 	 	definite	by	 add 	 ing 	 	the	definite	article	``	al	.	``
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 al 	 - 	 sha 	 lan 	 	--	the	 un 	 known 	 	thing	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	word	that	 appear 	 s 	 	 through 	 out 	 	early	 mathematic 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	10th	century	 deriv 	 ation 	 	of	 proof 	 s 	 	.
the	problem	for	the	 med 	 ieval 	 	spanish	 scholar 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	 task 	 ed 	 	with	 transl 	 ating 	 	 th 	 is 	 	material	is	that	the	letter	 she 	 en 	 	and	the	word	 sha 	 lan 	 	ca	n't	be	 render 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	spanish	 be 	 cause 	 	spanish	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	that	sh	,	that	``	sh	``	sound	.
so	by	convention	,	they	 create 	 d 	 	a	rule	in	which	they	 borrow 	 ed 	 	the	ck	sound	,	``	ck	``	sound	,	from	the	 classic 	 al 	 	greek	in	the	form	of	the	letter	kai	.
 lat 	 er 	 	when	 th 	 is 	 	material	was	 transl 	 ated 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	common	european	language	,	which	is	to	say	latin	,	they	 simpl 	 y 	 	 replace 	 d 	 	the	greek	kai	with	the	latin	x	.
and	once	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	once	 th 	 is 	 	material	was	in	latin	,	it	 form 	 ed 	 	the	 bas 	 is 	 	for	 mathematic 	 s 	 	 text 	 book 	 s 	 	for	 al 	 most 	 	600	 year 	 s 	 	.
but	now	we	have	the	answer	to	our	question	.
why	is	it	that	x	is	the	 un 	 known 	 	?
x	is	the	 un 	 known 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	you	ca	n't	say	``	sh	``	in	spanish	.
and	i	thought	that	was	worth	sharing	.
