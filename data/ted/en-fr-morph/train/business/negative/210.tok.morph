i	'm	a	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	artist	and	i	show	in	art	 gall 	 eries 	 	and	 museum 	 s 	 	.
i	show	a	number	of	 photograph 	 s 	 	and	 film 	 s 	 	,	but	i	 al 	 so 	 	make	 tele 	 vision 	 	 program 	 s 	 	,	 book 	 s 	 	and	some	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	,	all	with	the	same	 con 	 cept 	 	.
and	it	's	about	our	 fix 	 ation 	 	with	 celebr 	 ity 	 	and	 celebr 	 ity 	 	culture	,	and	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	the	image	:
 celebr 	 ity 	 	is	born	of	 photograph 	 y 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	start	with	how	i	 start 	 ed 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 cept 	 	seven	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	when	 prince 	 s 	 s 	 	diana	 di 	 ed 	 	.
there	was	a	sort	of	a	 stand 	 still 	 	in	britain	the	moment	of	her	death	,	and	people	 decide 	 d 	 	to	mourn	her	death	in	a	sort	of	mass	way	.
i	was	 fascinate 	 d 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	 phenomen 	 on 	 	,
so	i	 wonder 	 ed 	 	:	could	one	 er 	 ase 	 	the	image	of	diana	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 crud 	 e 	 ly 	 	and	 physical 	 ly 	 	?
so	,	i	got	a	gun	and	 start 	 ed 	 	to	shoot	at	the	image	of	diana	,
but	i	could	n't	 er 	 ase 	 	 th 	 is 	 	from	my	 memor 	 y 	 	and	 certain 	 ly 	 	it	was	not	 be 	 ing 	 	 era 	 s 	 ed 	 	from	the	public	 psych 	 e 	 	.
 moment 	 um 	 	was	 be 	 ing 	 	built	.
the	press	wrote	about	her	death	in	 ra 	 ther 	 	,	i	felt	,	 porno 	 graphic 	 	ways	--	like	,	``	which	bit	of	 art 	 ery 	 	left	which	bit	of	body	?	``	and	``	how	did	she	die	in	the	back	of	the	car	?	``	--
and	i	was	 intrigu 	 ed 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	mass	 voyeur 	 ism 	 	,
so	i	made	these	 ra 	 ther 	 	gory	 image 	 s 	 	.
i	then	went	on	 wonder 	 ing 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	i	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	replace	her	image	,
so	i	got	a	look	-	 a 	 like 	 	of	diana	and	posed	her	in	the	right	 position 	 s 	 	and	 angle 	 s 	 	and	 create 	 d 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	was	in	,	or	 exist 	 ed 	 	in	,	the	public	 imagin 	 ation 	 	.
so	people	 we 	 re 	 	 wonder 	 ing 	 	:	was	she	going	to	marry	dodi	?
was	she	in	love	with	him	?
was	she	 pregn 	 ant 	 	?	did	she	want	his	baby	?
was	she	 pregn 	 ant 	 	when	she	 di 	 ed 	 	?
so	i	 create 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	image	of	diana	,	dodi	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 imagin 	 ary 	 	 mix 	 ed 	 	-	race	child
and	 th 	 is 	 	image	came	out	,	which	 caus 	 ed 	 	a	huge	public	 out 	 cry 	 	at	the	time	.
i	then	went	on	to	make	more	 comment 	 s 	 	on	the	media	and	press	 image 	 ry 	 	,
so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	making	 re 	 ference 	 	to	media	 image 	 ry 	 	--	made	it	 grain 	 y 	 	,	shot	through	 door 	 ways 	 	and	so	on	and	so	forth	--	to	 titill 	 ate 	 	the	public	or	the	 view 	 er 	 	further	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	the	 view 	 er 	 	more	aware	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 voyeur 	 ism 	 	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	image	of	diana	looking	at	camilla	 kiss 	 ing 	 	her	husband	,
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	sequence	of	 image 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 get 	 s 	 	 show 	 n 	 	in	art	 gall 	 eries 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	sequence	.	and	 similar 	 ly 	 	with	the	di	-	dodian	baby	 image 	 ry 	 	--
 th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	art	 gall 	 ery 	 	 install 	 ation 	 	.
i	'm	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	how	you	ca	n't	 re 	 ly 	 	on	your	own	 per 	 ception 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	jane	smith	and	jo	bloggs	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	but	you	think	it	's	camilla	and	the	 que 	 en 	 	,
and	i	'm	 fascinate 	 d 	 	how	what	you	think	is	real	is	n't	 necess 	 arily 	 	real	.	and	the	camera	can	lie	,
and	it	 make 	 s 	 	it	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	with	the	mass	 bombard 	 ment 	 	of	 image 	 ry 	 	to	tell	 un 	 truth 	 s 	 	.
so	,	i	 continu 	 ed 	 	to	work	on	 th 	 is 	 	project	of	how	 photograph 	 y 	 	 seduce 	 s 	 	us	and	is	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	look	at	than	the	actual	real	subject	matter	.
and	at	the	same	time	,	it	 re 	 move 	 s 	 	us	from	the	real	subject	matter	,
and	 th 	 is 	 	 act 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	sort	of	 titill 	 ating 	 	thing	.
so	,	the	photograph	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 teas 	 er 	 	and	 inc 	 ites 	 	 desir 	 e 	 	and	 voyeur 	 ism 	 	;
what	you	ca	n't	have	,	you	want	more	.
in	the	photograph	,	the	real	subject	 do 	 es 	 	n't	exist
so	it	 make 	 s 	 	you	want	that	person	more	.
and	that	is	the	way	,	i	think	,	that	 celebr 	 ity 	 	 magazine 	 s 	 	work	now	:
the	more	 picture 	 s 	 	you	see	of	these	 celebr 	 ities 	 	,	the	more	you	feel	you	know	them	,	but	you	do	n't	know	them	and	you	want	to	know	them	further	.
of	course	,	the	 que 	 en 	 	 go 	 es 	 	to	her	stud	often	to	watch	her	 horse 	 s 	 	...	watch	her	 horse 	 s 	 	.	.
and	then	i	was	sort	of	making	 image 	 ry 	 	.
in	england	there	's	an	 express 	 ion 	 	:	``	you	ca	n't	imagine	the	 que 	 en 	 	on	the	loo	.	``
so	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	penetrate	that	.
well	,	here	is	the	image	.
all	 th 	 is 	 	 image 	 ry 	 	was	creating	a	lot	of	 fu 	 s 	 s 	 
and	i	was	 cit 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 disgust 	 ing 	 	artist	.	the	press	 we 	 re 	 	writing	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	giving	full	 page 	 s 	 	about	how	 terr 	 ible 	 	 th 	 is 	 	was	.	which	i	found	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	that	it	was	going	full	cycle	:
i	was	making	 comment 	 s 	 	about	the	press	and	about	how	we	know	 fact 	 s 	 	and	information	 on 	 ly 	 	by	media	--	 be 	 cause 	 	we	do	n't	know	the	real	people	;
 ver 	 y 	 	few	of	us	know	the	real	people	--
but	it	was	going	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	press	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 public 	 izing 	 	,	 effective 	 ly 	 	,	my	 filth 	 y 	 	work	.
so	,	these	are	 broad 	 sheet 	 s 	 	,	 tabloid 	 s 	 	,	 debate 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	had	all	about	 th 	 is 	 	work	,
 film 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 bann 	 ed 	 	before	people	had	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	the	look	at	the	work	,
 politic 	 ians 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	--
all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	--	great	 head 	 lines 	 	.
then	 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	it	 start 	 ed 	 	to	get	on	front	 page 	 s 	 	.
i	was	 be 	 ing 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	and	paid	to	do	front	 cover 	 s 	 	.
 sudden 	 ly 	 	i	was	 be 	 coming 	 	sort	of	 accept 	 able 	 	,	which	i	found	 al 	 so 	 	 fasci 	 nating 	 	.
how	one	moment	--	it	was	 disgust 	 ing 	 	--	 journalist 	 s 	 	would	lie	to	me	to	get	a	story	or	a	photograph	of	me	,	 say 	 ing 	 	my	work	was	 wonder 	 ful 	 	,	and	the	next	minute	there	 we 	 re 	 	 terr 	 ible 	 	 head 	 lines 	 	about	me	.
but	then	 th 	 is 	 	 change 	 d 	 	 sudden 	 ly 	 	.
i	then	 start 	 ed 	 	to	work	for	 magazine 	 s 	 	and	 news 	 paper 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	an	image	that	went	 in 	 to 	 	tatler	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	 an 	 other 	 	 news 	 paper 	 	image	.
it	was	an	april	fool	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	and	to	 th 	 is 	 	day	some	people	think	it	's	real	.
i	was	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	next	to	 some 	 one 	 	at	 d 	 inner 	 	the	other	day	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	great	image	of	the	 que 	 en 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	 out 	 side 	 	william	hill	.
they	thought	it	was	real	.
i	was	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	,	at	the	time	,	the	 hyper 	 bo 	 le 	 	of	 icon 	 s 	 	--	and	diana	and	marilyn	--	and	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	 celebr 	 ity 	 	in	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
how	they	wheedle	 the 	 ir 	 	way	 in 	 to 	 	the	 collect 	 ive 	 	 psych 	 e 	 	 with 	 out 	 	us	even	 know 	 ing 	 	,	and	how	that	should	happen	.
i	 explore 	 d 	 	with	 actual 	 ly 	 	 dress 	 ing 	 	up	 a 	 s 	 	the	 celebr 	 ities 	 	 my 	 self 	 	.
there	's	me	 a 	 s 	 	diana	--
i	look	like	the	mass	 murder 	 er 	 	myra	hindley	,	i	think	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	one	.	.
and	me	 a 	 s 	 	the	 que 	 en 	 	.
i	then	 continu 	 ed 	 	on	to	make	a	whole	body	of	work	about	marilyn	--	the	 big 	 gest 	 	icon	of	all	--
and	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 titill 	 ate 	 	by	 shoot 	 ing 	 	through	 door 	 ways 	 	and	 shut 	 ter 	 s 	 	and	so	on	and	so	forth	,	and	 on 	 ly 	 	 show 	 ing 	 	certain	 angle 	 s 	 	to	create	a	 re 	 ality 	 	that	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	is	 complete 	 ly 	 	 construct 	 ed 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	look	-	 a 	 like 	 	,	so	the	 craft 	 ing 	 	 element 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	 complete 	 ly 	 	enormous	.	she	 look 	 s 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	like	marilyn	,
but	by	the	time	we	've	made	her	up	and	put	 wig 	 s 	 	and	 make 	 up 	 	on	,	she	 look 	 s 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	like	marilyn	,	to	the	 ex 	 tent 	 	that	her	husband	could	n't	 recogn 	 ize 	 	her	--	or	 recogn 	 ize 	 	 th 	 is 	 	look	-	 a 	 like 	 	--	in	these	 photograph 	 s 	 	,	which	i	find	 quit 	 e 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
so	,	all	 th 	 is 	 	work	is	 get 	 ting 	 	 show 	 n 	 	in	art	 gall 	 eries 	 	.
then	i	made	a	book	.
i	was	 al 	 so 	 	making	a	tv	 s 	 eries 	 	for	the	bbc	at	the	time	.
 still 	 s 	 	from	the	tv	 s 	 eries 	 	went	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	book	.
but	there	was	a	real	legal	problem	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 look 	 s 	 	real	,	but	how	do	you	get	over	that	?
 be 	 cause 	 	 obvious 	 ly 	 	it	's	making	a	comment	about	our	culture	right	now	:	that	we	ca	n't	tell	what	's	real	.
how	do	we	know	when	we	're	looking	at	 some 	 thing 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	real	or	not	?
so	,	from	my	point	of	view	,	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	publish	it	,	but	at	the	same	time	it	 do 	 es 	 	cause	a	 con 	 fusion 	 	--	intentional	on	my	 be 	 half 	 	,	but	 problem 	 atic 	 	for	any	 out 	 let 	 	that	i	'm	 work 	 ing 	 	with	.
so	a	big	 dis 	 claim 	 er 	 	is	put	on	 every 	 thing 	 	that	i	do	,	and	i	made	 narrative 	 s 	 	about	all	the	european	or	brit	 celebr 	 ities 	 	and	 comment 	 s 	 	about	our	public	 figure 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	tony	blair	get	up	to	in	private	with	his	fashion	guru	?
and	 al 	 so 	 	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	the	 per 	 ception 	 s 	 	that	are	put	about	bin	laden	,	saddam	hussein	,	the	 link 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	put	about	pre	-	 ir 	 aq 	 	war	.
and	what	is	going	to	happen	to	the	 mon 	 arch 	 y 	 	?	 be 	 cause 	 	 obvious 	 ly 	 	the	british	public	,	i	think	,	would	prefer	william	to	charles	on	the	 thr 	 one 	 	.
and	it	's	that	wish	,	or	that	 desir 	 e 	 	,	that	i	suppose	i	'm	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	in	my	work	.
i	'm	not	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	 celebr 	 ity 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
i	'm	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	 per 	 ception 	 	of	the	 celebr 	 ity 	 	.
and	with	some	look	-	alikes	,	they	are	so	good
you	do	n't	know	 whet 	 her 	 	they	're	real	or	not	.
i	did	an	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	campaign	for	schweppes	,	which	is	coca	-	 col 	 a 	 	,	and	so	that	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	 legal 	 ities 	 	.
it	's	 high 	 ly 	 	commercial	.
but	it	was	a	 difficult 	 y 	 	for	me	--	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	 art 	 work 	 	;
should	i	do	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	?	--	at	the	time	.
so	i	made	 s 	 ure 	 	the	work	was	not	 com 	 promise 	 d 	 	in	any	way	and	that	the	 integ 	 r 	 ity 	 	of	the	work	 remain 	 ed 	 	the	same	.
but	the	 meaning 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	in	the	sense	that	with	the	logo	on	,	you	're	 clo 	 s 	 ing 	 	all	the	lines	of	 interpret 	 ation 	 	down	to	selling	a	product	and	that	's	all	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	.
when	you	take	the	logo	off	,	you	're	 open 	 ing 	 	up	the	 interpret 	 ations 	 	and	making	the	work	 in 	 conclusive 	 	,
 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	conclusive	when	you	are	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	image	is	 quit 	 e 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	we	made	it	three	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.	and	it	's	camilla	in	her	 wed 	 d 	 ing 	 	dress	,	which	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 near 	 ly 	 	got	re	-	used	now	,	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	prior	to	her	 wed 	 d 	 ing 	 	.
tony	blair	and	cherie	.	and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	 legal 	 ities 	 	--	we	had	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 care 	 ful 	 	.
it	's	 obvious 	 ly 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	big	commercial	company	,	and	so	 th 	 is 	 	little	,	``	shh	--	it	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	them	,	``	was	put	on	the	side	of	the	 image 	 ry 	 	.
and	margaret	thatcher	 visit 	 ing 	 	jeffery	archer	in	jail	.
i	then	was	 ask 	 ed 	 	by	selfridges	to	do	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 window 	 s 	 	for	them	,
so	i	built	a	 s 	 au 	 na 	 	bath	in	one	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 window 	 s 	 	and	 create 	 d 	 	little	 scene 	 s 	 	--	live	 scene 	 s 	 	with	look	-	alikes	 in 	 side 	 	the	 window 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 window 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	all	 s 	 team 	 ed 	 	up	.
so	,	it	's	tony	blair	 read 	 ing 	 	and	 p 	 rac 	 tic 	 ing 	 	his	speech	;
i	've	got	them	 do 	 ing 	 	 y 	 oga 	 	 in 	 side 	 	there	with	carole	caplin	;	sven	making	out	with	ulrika	jonsson	,	who	he	was	 hav 	 ing 	 	an	 af 	 fair 	 	with	at	that	time	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	huge	success	for	them	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 image 	 ry 	 	got	 show 	 n 	 	in	the	press	the	day	after	in	every	single	 news 	 paper 	 	,	 broad 	 sheet 	 s 	 	and	 tabloid 	 s 	 	.
it	was	a	bit	of	a	road	 stop 	 per 	 	,	which	was	 problem 	 atic 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	police	 ke 	 pt 	 	on	 try 	 ing 	 	to	clear	away	the	 crowd 	 s 	 	,
but	huge	 f 	 un 	 	--	it	was	great	for	me	to	do	a	performance	.
 al 	 so 	 	,	people	 we 	 re 	 	taking	 photograph 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	so	it	was	 be 	 ing 	 	 text 	 ed 	 	around	the	world	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	all	 th 	 is 	 	 image 	 ry 	 	.

i	suppose	i	come	from	a	sort	of	non	-	 humor 	 ous 	 	 back 	 ground 	 	with	serious	intent	,

and	i	think	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	matter	that	my	work	is	 consider 	 ed 	 	 humor 	 ous 	 	,	in	a	way	;	i	think	it	's	a	way	in	for	me	to	deal	with	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	 image 	 ry 	 	and	how	we	read	all	our	information	through	 image 	 ry 	 	.
it	's	an	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	fast	way	of	 get 	 ting 	 	information	.
it	's	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	difficult	if	it	's	 construct 	 ed 	 	 correct 	 ly 	 	,	and	there	are	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	of	 construct 	 ing 	 	 icon 	 ic 	 	 image 	 ry 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	image	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	is	sort	of	spot	-	on	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 exact 	 ly 	 	 sum 	 s 	 	up	what	elton	may	be	 do 	 ing 	 	in	private	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	what	might	be	 happen 	 ing 	 	with	saddam	hussein	,	and	george	bush	 read 	 ing 	 	the	koran	 up 	 side 	 	-	down	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	george	bush	target	practice	--	 shoot 	 ing 	 	at	bin	laden	and	michael	moore	.
and	then	you	change	the	photograph	he	's	 shoot 	 ing 	 	at	,	and	it	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	grim	and	 may 	 be 	 	less	 access 	 ible 	 	.	.
