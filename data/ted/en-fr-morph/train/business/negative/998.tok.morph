i	guess	the	story	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	start	 may 	 be 	 	back	in	the	the	1960s	,	when	i	was	seven	or	eight	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	 watch 	 ing 	 	jacques	cousteau	 document 	 aries 	 	on	the	living	room	floor	with	my	mask	and	 flip 	 per 	 s 	 	on	.
then	after	every	episode	,	i	had	to	go	up	to	the	 bath 	 tub 	 	and	swim	around	the	 bath 	 tub 	 	and	look	at	the	drain	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	all	there	was	to	look	at	.
and	by	the	time	i	 turn 	 ed 	 	16	,	i	 pursue 	 d 	 	a	 care 	 er 	 	in	marine	science	,	in	exploration	and	 div 	 ing 	 	,	and	lived	in	 under 	 water 	 	 habit 	 at 	 s 	 	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	one	off	the	florida	 key 	 s 	 	,	for	30	 day 	 s 	 	total	.
brian	skerry	took	 th 	 is 	 	shot	.	 thank 	 s 	 	,	brian	.
and	i	've	 div 	 ed 	 	in	deep	-	sea	 submersible 	 s 	 	around	the	world	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	one	is	the	 deep 	 est 	 	 div 	 ing 	 	 sub 	 marine 	 	in	the	world	,	 oper 	 ated 	 	by	the	japanese	government	.
and	sylvia	earle	and	i	 we 	 re 	 	on	an	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 sub 	 marine 	 	20	 year 	 s 	 	ago	in	japan	.
and	on	my	 d 	 ive 	 	,	i	went	down	18,000	feet	,	to	an	area	that	i	thought	would	be	 pr 	 ist 	 ine 	 	 wild 	 er 	 ness 	 	area	on	the	sea	floor	.
but	when	i	got	there	,	i	found	 lot 	 s 	 	of	plastic	garbage	and	other	 deb 	 ris 	 	.
and	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	a	 turn 	 ing 	 	point	in	my	life	,	where	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	i	could	n't	just	go	have	 f 	 un 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	science	and	exploration	.	i	 need 	 ed 	 	to	put	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	 con 	 text 	 	.
i	 need 	 ed 	 	to	head	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 conserv 	 ation 	 	 goal 	 s 	 	.
so	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	work	with	national	 geo 	 graphic 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	and	 other 	 s 	 	and	led	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 s 	 	to	antarctica	.
i	led	three	 div 	 ing 	 	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 s 	 	to	antarctica	.
ten	 year 	 s 	 	ago	was	a	 semi 	 nal 	 	trip	,	where	we	 explore 	 d 	 	that	big	 ice 	 berg 	 	,	b	-	15	,	the	largest	 ice 	 berg 	 	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	that	broke	off	the	ross	ice	shelf	.
and	we	 develop 	 ed 	 	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	to	 d 	 ive 	 	 in 	 side 	 	and	under	the	 ice 	 berg 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 heat 	 ing 	 	 pad 	 s 	 	on	our	 kid 	 ney 	 s 	 	with	a	 batt 	 ery 	 	that	we	 drag 	 ged 	 	around	,	so	that	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	blood	 flow 	 ed 	 	through	our	 kid 	 ney 	 s 	 	,	it	would	get	a	little	boost	of	 warm 	 th 	 	before	going	back	 in 	 to 	 	our	bodies	.
but	after	three	 trip 	 s 	 	to	antarctica	,	i	 decide 	 d 	 	that	it	might	be	 nic 	 er 	 	to	work	in	 warm 	 er 	 	water	.
and	that	same	year	,	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	headed	north	to	the	phoenix	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	that	story	here	in	a	moment	.
but	before	i	do	,	i	just	want	you	to	ponder	 th 	 is 	 	graph	for	a	moment	.
you	may	have	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	other	 form 	 s 	 	,	but	the	top	line	is	the	amount	of	 protect 	 ed 	 	area	on	land	,	 global 	 ly 	 	,	and	it	's	about	12	percent	.
and	you	can	see	that	it	kind	of	 hoc 	 key 	 	 stick 	 s 	 	up	around	the	1960s	and	'70s	,
and	it	's	on	kind	of	a	nice	 tra 	 ject 	 ory 	 	right	now	.
and	that	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	when	 every 	 body 	 	got	aware	of	the	environment	and	earth	day	and	all	the	stuff	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	'60s	with	the	 hip 	 pies 	 	and	 every 	 thing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	did	,	i	think	,	have	an	affect	on	global	 aware 	 ness 	 	.
but	the	ocean	-	 protect 	 ed 	 	area	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	flat	line	 un 	 til 	 	right	about	now	--	it	 appear 	 s 	 	to	be	 tick 	 ing 	 	up	.
and	i	do	 believ 	 e 	 	that	we	are	at	the	 hoc 	 key 	 	stick	point	of	the	 protect 	 ed 	 	area	in	the	ocean	.
i	think	we	would	have	gotten	there	a	lot	 ear 	 lier 	 	if	we	could	see	what	 happen 	 s 	 	in	the	ocean	like	we	can	see	what	 happen 	 s 	 	on	land	.
but	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	the	ocean	is	 opa 	 que 	 	,	and	we	ca	n't	see	what	's	going	on	.
and	 there 	 fore 	 	we	're	way	 be 	 hind 	 	on	 protect 	 ion 	 	.
but	scuba	 div 	 ing 	 	,	 submersible 	 s 	 	and	all	the	work	that	we	're	setting	about	to	do	here	will	help	 rect 	 ify 	 	that	.
so	where	are	the	phoenix	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	?
they	 we 	 re 	 	the	world	's	largest	marine	-	 protect 	 ed 	 	area	up	 un 	 til 	 	last	week	when	the	chagos	 arch 	 ipelago 	 	was	 declare 	 d 	 	.
it	's	in	the	mid	-	 pac 	 ific 	 	.	it	's	about	five	 day 	 s 	 	from	 any 	 where 	 	.
if	you	want	to	get	to	the	phoenix	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	,	it	's	five	 day 	 s 	 	from	fiji	,	it	's	five	 day 	 s 	 	from	hawaii	,	it	's	five	 day 	 s 	 	from	samoa	.
it	's	out	in	the	middle	of	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	,	right	around	the	 equ 	 ator 	 	.
i	had	never	heard	of	the	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	nor	the	country	,	kiribati	,	that	 own 	 s 	 	them	,	till	two	 friend 	 s 	 	of	mine	who	run	a	 live 	 a 	 board 	 	 d 	 ive 	 	boat	in	fiji	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	greg	,	would	you	lead	a	scientific	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 	up	to	these	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	?
they	've	never	 be 	 en 	 	 div 	 ed 	 	.	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	.
but	tell	me	where	they	are	and	the	country	that	 own 	 s 	 	them	.	``
so	that	's	when	i	first	 learn 	 ed 	 	of	the	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	and	had	no	idea	what	i	was	 get 	 ting 	 	 in 	 to 	 	.
but	i	was	in	for	the	adventure	.
let	me	give	you	a	little	peek	here	of	the	phoenix	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	-	 protect 	 ed 	 	area	.
it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	deep	-	water	part	of	our	planet	.
the	average	 depth 	 s 	 	are	about	12,000	ft	.
there	's	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 sea 	 mount 	 s 	 	in	the	phoenix	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	,	which	are	 specific 	 ally 	 	part	of	the	 protect 	 ed 	 	area	.
 sea 	 mount 	 s 	 	are	 import 	 ant 	 	for	 bio 	 divers 	 ity 	 	.
there	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	more	 mountain 	 s 	 	in	the	ocean	than	there	are	on	land	.
it	's	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	fact	.
and	the	phoenix	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	rich	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 sea 	 mount 	 s 	 	.
so	it	's	a	deep	--	think	about	it	in	a	big	three	-	dimensional	space	,	 ver 	 y 	 	deep	three	-	dimensional	space	with	 herd 	 s 	 	of	tuna	,	 whale 	 s 	 	,	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	deep	sea	marine	life	like	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	here	before	.
that	's	the	vessel	that	we	took	up	there	for	these	 stud 	 ies 	 	,	early	on	,	and	that	's	what	the	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	look	like	--	you	can	see	in	the	 back 	 ground 	 	.
they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	low	to	the	water	,	and	they	're	all	 un 	 inhabit 	 ed 	 	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	one	 is 	 land 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	about	35	 care 	 taker 	 s 	 	on	it	.
and	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	 un 	 inhabit 	 ed 	 	for	most	of	time	 be 	 cause 	 	even	in	the	ancient	 day 	 s 	 	,	these	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	too	far	away	from	the	bright	 light 	 s 	 	of	fiji	and	hawaii	and	tahiti	for	 t 	 hose 	 	ancient	polynesian	 marin 	 ers 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 tra 	 ver 	 s 	 ing 	 	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	so	 wide 	 ly 	 	.
but	we	got	up	there	,	and	i	had	the	 un 	 ique 	 	and	 wonder 	 ful 	 	scientific	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	and	personal	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	get	to	a	place	that	had	never	 be 	 en 	 	 div 	 ed 	 	and	just	get	to	an	 is 	 land 	 	and	go	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	where	are	we	going	to	 d 	 ive 	 	?
let	's	try	there	,	``	and	then	 fall 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	water	.
both	my	personal	and	my	professional	life	 change 	 d 	 	.
 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	i	saw	a	world	that	i	had	never	 s 	 een 	 	before	in	the	ocean	--	 school 	 s 	 	of	fish	that	 we 	 re 	 	so	dense	they	 dull 	 ed 	 	the	 penet 	 ration 	 	of	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	from	the	surface	,	coral	 reef 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 continu 	 ous 	 	and	solid	and	 color 	 ful 	 	,	large	fish	 every 	 where 	 	,	 man 	 ta 	 	 ray 	 s 	 	.
it	was	an	 eco 	 system 	 	.	 par 	 rot 	 fish 	 	 spawn 	 ing 	 	--
 th 	 is 	 	is	about	5,000	 long 	 nose 	 	 par 	 rot 	 fish 	 	 spawn 	 ing 	 	at	the	 en 	 trance 	 	to	one	of	the	phoenix	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	.
you	can	see	the	fish	are	 ball 	 ed 	 	up	and	then	there	's	a	little	 cloud 	 y 	 	area	there	where	they	're	 ex 	 changing 	 	the	 egg 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 perm 	 	for	 re 	 production 	 	--
 event 	 s 	 	that	the	ocean	is	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	do	,	but	 struggle 	 s 	 	to	do	in	 man 	 y 	 	 place 	 s 	 	now	 be 	 cause 	 	of	human	activity	.
the	phoenix	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	and	all	the	 equ 	 ator 	 ial 	 	 part 	 s 	 	of	our	planet	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	for	tuna	 fish 	 eries 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 yellow 	 fin 	 	tuna	that	you	see	here	.
phoenix	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	is	a	major	tuna	location	.
and	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	--	we	had	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	on	our	early	 div 	 es 	 	,	up	to	150	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	at	once	,	which	is	an	 indic 	 ation 	 	of	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 health 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	,	system	.
so	i	thought	the	 scene 	 s 	 	of	never	-	 end 	 ing 	 	 wild 	 er 	 ness 	 	would	go	on	 fore 	 ver 	 	,
but	they	did	 final 	 ly 	 	come	to	an	end	.
and	we	 explore 	 d 	 	the	surface	of	the	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	--	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	bird	 nest 	 ing 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	some	of	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	bird	-	 nest 	 ing 	 	 s 	 ites 	 	in	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	,	in	the	world	.
and	we	 finish 	 ed 	 	our	trip	.
and	that	's	the	area	 aga 	 in 	 	.
you	can	see	the	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	--	there	are	eight	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	--	that	pop	out	of	the	water	.
the	 peak 	 s 	 	that	do	n't	come	out	of	the	water	are	the	 sea 	 mount 	 s 	 	.
remember	,	a	 sea 	 mount 	 	 turn 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	an	 is 	 land 	 	when	it	 hit 	 s 	 	the	surface	.
and	what	's	the	 con 	 text 	 	of	the	phoenix	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	?
where	do	these	exist	?
well	they	exist	in	the	 re 	 public 	 	of	kiribati	,	and	kiribati	is	 locate 	 d 	 	in	the	central	 pac 	 ific 	 	in	three	 is 	 land 	 	 group 	 s 	 	.
in	the	west	we	have	the	gilbert	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	.	in	the	center	we	have	the	phoenix	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	,	which	is	the	subject	that	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	.	and	then	over	to	the	east	we	have	the	line	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	.
it	's	the	largest	 a 	 toll 	 	nation	in	the	world	.
and	they	have	about	110,000	people	spread	out	over	33	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	.
they	control	3.4	million	cubic	 mile 	 s 	 	of	ocean	,	and	that	's	between	one	and	two	percent	of	all	the	ocean	water	on	the	planet	.
and	when	i	was	first	going	up	there	,	i	 bare 	 ly 	 	 k 	 new 	 	the	name	of	 th 	 is 	 	country	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	people	would	ask	me	,	``	why	are	you	going	to	 th 	 is 	 	place	 call 	 ed 	 	kiribati	?	``
and	it	 re 	 minded 	 	me	of	that	old	joke	where	the	bank	robber	 come 	 s 	 	out	of	the	 court 	 house 	 	 hand 	 cuff 	 ed 	 	,	and	the	 report 	 er 	 	 yell 	 s 	 	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	 will 	 y 	 	.	why	do	you	rob	 bank 	 s 	 	?	``
and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	cause	that	's	where	all	the	money	is	.	``
and	i	would	tell	people	,	``	why	do	i	go	to	kiribati	?
 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	where	all	the	ocean	is	.	``
they	 bas 	 ically 	 	are	one	nation	that	 control 	 s 	 	most	of	the	 equ 	 ator 	 ial 	 	 water 	 s 	 	of	the	central	 pac 	 ific 	 	ocean	.
they	're	 al 	 so 	 	a	country	that	is	in	 di 	 re 	 	danger	.
sea	 level 	 s 	 	are	 ris 	 ing 	 	,	and	kiribati	,	 a 	 long 	 	with	42	other	 nation 	 s 	 	in	the	world	,	will	be	under	water	 with 	 in 	 	50	to	100	 year 	 s 	 	due	to	climate	change	and	the	 associate 	 d 	 	sea	-	level	rise	from	thermal	expansion	and	the	 melt 	 ing 	 	of	 fresh 	 water 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	ocean	.
the	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	rise	 on 	 ly 	 	one	to	two	 meter 	 s 	 	above	the	surface	.
some	of	the	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	have	 al 	 ready 	 	gone	under	water	.
and	these	 nation 	 s 	 	are	 face 	 d 	 	with	a	real	problem	.
we	 a 	 s 	 	a	world	are	 face 	 d 	 	with	a	problem	.
what	do	we	do	with	 dis 	 place 	 d 	 	fellow	earthlings	who	no	 long 	 er 	 	have	a	home	on	the	planet	?
the	 p 	 resident 	 	of	the	maldives	 conduct 	 ed 	 	a	mock	cabinet	 meet 	 ing 	 	 under 	 water 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	to	 high 	 light 	 	the	 di 	 re 	 	 s 	 trait 	 s 	 	of	these	 count 	 ries 	 	.
so	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	we	need	to	focus	on	.
but	back	to	the	phoenix	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	,	which	is	the	subject	of	 th 	 is 	 	talk	.
after	i	got	back	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 amaz 	 ing 	 	,	what	we	found	.
i	'd	like	to	go	back	and	share	it	with	the	government	of	kiribati	,	who	are	over	in	tarawa	,	the	 western 	 most 	 	group	.
so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 contact 	 ing 	 	them	--	 be 	 cause 	 	they	had	 actual 	 ly 	 	 give 	 n 	 	me	a	permit	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	--	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	want	to	come	up	and	tell	you	what	we	found	.	``
and	for	some	reason	they	did	n't	want	me	to	come	,	or	it	was	hard	to	find	a	time	and	a	place	,	and	it	took	a	while	,	but	 final 	 ly 	 	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	you	can	come	.
but	if	you	come	,	you	have	to	buy	lunch	for	 every 	 body 	 	who	 come 	 s 	 	to	the	 semi 	 nar 	 	.	``
so	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	i	'm	happy	to	buy	lunch	.
just	get	 what 	 ever 	 	 any 	 body 	 	 want 	 s 	 	.	``
so	david	obura	,	a	coral	reef	biologist	,	and	i	went	to	tarawa	,	and	we	 present 	 ed 	 	for	two	 hour 	 s 	 	on	the	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 find 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	the	phoenix	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	.
and	the	country	never	 k 	 new 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.	they	never	had	any	data	from	 th 	 is 	 	area	.
they	'd	never	had	any	information	from	the	phoenix	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	.
after	the	talk	,	the	 mini 	 ster 	 	of	 fish 	 eries 	 	 walk 	 ed 	 	up	to	me	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	greg	,	do	you	 real 	 ize 	 	that	you	are	the	first	scientist	who	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	come	back	and	told	us	what	they	did	?	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	often	issue	these	 permit 	 s 	 	to	do	research	in	our	 water 	 s 	 	,	but	 usual 	 ly 	 	we	get	a	note	two	or	three	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	or	a	 re 	 print 	 	.
but	you	're	the	first	one	who	's	ever	come	back	and	told	us	what	you	did	.
and	we	 re 	 ally 	 	appreciate	that	.	and	we	're	 buy 	 ing 	 	you	lunch	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	are	you	free	for	 d 	 inner 	 	?	``
and	i	was	free	for	 d 	 inner 	 	,	and	i	went	out	to	 d 	 inner 	 	with	the	 mini 	 ster 	 	of	 fish 	 eries 	 	in	kiribati	.
and	over	the	course	of	 d 	 inner 	 	,	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	kiribati	 gain 	 s 	 	most	of	 it 	 s 	 	revenue	--	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	poor	country	--	but	it	 gain 	 s 	 	what	revenue	is	 ha 	 s 	 	by	selling	access	to	foreign	 nation 	 s 	 	to	take	fish	out	of	 it 	 s 	 	 water 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	kiribati	 do 	 es 	 	not	have	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	take	the	fish	 it 	 self 	 	.
and	the	deal	that	they	strike	is	the	 ex 	 tract 	 ing 	 	country	 give 	 s 	 	kiribati	five	percent	of	the	 land 	 ed 	 	value	.
so	if	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 re 	 move 	 s 	 	a	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	'	worth	of	 lob 	 sters 	 	from	a	reef	,	kiribati	 get 	 s 	 	50,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
and	,	you	know	,	it	did	n't	seem	like	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	deal	to	me	.
so	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	 mini 	 ster 	 	over	 d 	 inner 	 	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	would	you	consider	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	where	you	would	still	get	paid	--	we	do	the	math	and	figure	out	what	the	value	of	the	resource	is	--	but	you	 leav 	 e 	 	fish	and	the	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	and	the	shrimp	in	the	water	?	``
he	 stop 	 ped 	 	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	we	would	like	to	do	that	to	deal	with	our	 over 	 fish 	 ing 	 	problem	,	and	i	think	we	would	call	it	a	reverse	 fish 	 ing 	 	 licens 	 e 	 	.	``
he	 co 	 in 	 ed 	 	the	term	``	reverse	 fish 	 ing 	 	 licens 	 e 	 	.	``
so	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	a	'	reverse	 fish 	 ing 	 	 licens 	 e 	 	.	'	``
so	we	 walk 	 ed 	 	away	from	 th 	 is 	 	 d 	 inner 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	not	 know 	 ing 	 	where	to	go	at	that	point	.
i	went	back	to	the	 state 	 s 	 	and	 start 	 ed 	 	looking	around	where	reverse	 fish 	 ing 	 	 licens 	 es 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	 issue 	 d 	 	,
and	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	there	 we 	 re 	 	 non 	 e 	 	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	no	 ocean 	 ic 	 	 deal 	 s 	 	where	 count 	 ries 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 compens 	 ated 	 	for	not	 fish 	 ing 	 	.
it	had	 occur 	 red 	 	on	land	,	in	 rain 	 forest 	 s 	 	of	south	america	and	africa	,	where	 land 	 owner 	 s 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	paid	not	to	cut	the	 tree 	 s 	 	down	.
and	 conserv 	 ation 	 	 inter 	 national 	 	had	 s 	 truck 	 	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 deal 	 s 	 	.
so	i	went	to	 conserv 	 ation 	 	 inter 	 national 	 	and	 br 	 ought 	 	them	in	 a 	 s 	 	a	partner	and	went	through	the	process	of	 valu 	 ing 	 	the	 fish 	 ery 	 	resource	,	 dec 	 id 	 ing 	 	how	much	kiribati	should	be	 compens 	 ated 	 	,	what	the	range	of	the	 fish 	 es 	 	 we 	 re 	 	,	 br 	 ought 	 	in	a	whole	bunch	of	other	 partner 	 s 	 	--	the	government	of	australia	,	the	government	of	new	zealand	,	the	world	bank	.
the	oak	 found 	 ation 	 	and	national	 geo 	 graphic 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	big	 fund 	 ers 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
and	we	 bas 	 ically 	 	 found 	 ed 	 	the	park	on	the	idea	of	an	 end 	 ow 	 ment 	 	that	would	pay	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	lost	 fish 	 ing 	 	 licens 	 e 	 	 fee 	 s 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	poor	country	to	keep	the	area	 in 	 tact 	 	.
 half 	 way 	 	through	 th 	 is 	 	process	,	i	met	the	 p 	 resident 	 	of	kiribati	,	 p 	 resident 	 	anote	tong	.	he	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 lead 	 er 	 	,	a	real	 vision 	 ary 	 	,	forward	-	 think 	 ing 	 	man	,	and	he	told	me	two	 thing 	 s 	 	when	i	 approach 	 ed 	 	him	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	greg	,	there	's	two	 thing 	 s 	 	i	'd	like	you	to	do	.
one	is	,	remember	i	'm	a	 politic 	 ian 	 	,	so	you	've	got	to	go	out	and	work	with	my	 mini 	 sters 	 	and	 con 	 vince 	 	the	people	of	kiribati	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	good	idea	.
 second 	 ly 	 	,	i	'd	like	you	to	create	 principle 	 s 	 	that	will	transcend	my	own	 pre 	 side 	 ncy 	 	.
i	do	n't	want	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	if	it	's	going	to	go	away	after	i	'm	 vot 	 ed 	 	out	of	 off 	 ice 	 	.	``
so	we	had	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	good	vision	and	a	lot	of	science	,	a	lot	of	 lawyer 	 s 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	.
 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 step 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	taken	to	pull	 th 	 is 	 	off	.
and	it	was	 prim 	 arily 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	kiribati	 real 	 ized 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	self	-	interest	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
they	 real 	 ized 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	common	cause	with	the	 conserv 	 ation 	 	community	.
then	in	2002	,	when	 th 	 is 	 	was	all	going	full	-	 s 	 wing 	 	,	a	coral	-	 bleach 	 ing 	 	event	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	phoenix	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	.
here	's	 th 	 is 	 	resource	that	we	're	looking	to	 s 	 ave 	 	,	and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	it	's	the	 hot 	 test 	 	 heat 	 ing 	 	event	the	ocean	heated	up	 a 	 s 	 	it	 do 	 es 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	and	the	hot	spot	 form 	 ed 	 	and	 stall 	 ed 	 	right	over	the	phoenix	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	for	six	 month 	 s 	 	.
it	was	over	32	 degree 	 s 	 	celsius	for	six	 month 	 s 	 
and	it	 bas 	 ically 	 	 kill 	 ed 	 	60	percent	of	the	coral	.
so	 sudden 	 ly 	 	we	had	 th 	 is 	 	area	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 protect 	 ing 	 	,	but	now	it	 appear 	 ed 	 	to	be	dead	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	in	the	coral	 area 	 s 	 	.
of	course	the	deep	-	sea	 area 	 s 	 	and	the	open	ocean	 area 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	fine	,	but	the	coral	,	which	 every 	 body 	 	 like 	 s 	 	to	look	at	,	was	in	trouble	.
well	,	the	good	news	is	it	's	 re 	 cover 	 ed 	 	and	 re 	 cover 	 ing 	 	fast	,	 fast 	 er 	 	than	any	reef	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	picture	was	just	taken	by	brian	skerry	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	ago	when	we	 return 	 ed 	 	to	the	phoenix	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	and	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	a	 protect 	 ed 	 	area	and	 ha 	 s 	 	 health 	 y 	 	fish	 population 	 s 	 	that	keep	the	 al 	 ga 	 e 	 	 graze 	 d 	 	down	and	keep	the	rest	of	the	reef	 health 	 y 	 	,	the	coral	is	 boom 	 ing 	 	,	is	just	 boom 	 ing 	 	back	.
it	's	 al 	 most 	 	like	if	a	person	 ha 	 s 	 	 multi 	 ple 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	,	it	's	hard	to	get	well	,	you	might	die	,	but	if	you	 on 	 ly 	 	have	one	disease	to	deal	with	,	you	can	get	better	.
and	that	's	the	story	with	climate	-	change	 heat 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	threat	,	the	 on 	 ly 	 	influence	that	the	reef	had	to	deal	with	.
there	was	no	 fish 	 ing 	 	,	there	was	no	 poll 	 ution 	 	,	there	was	no	 coast 	 al 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	,	and	the	reef	is	on	a	full	-	bore	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	.
now	i	remember	that	 d 	 inner 	 	i	had	with	the	 mini 	 ster 	 	of	 fish 	 eries 	 	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	when	we	first	 br 	 ought 	 	 th 	 is 	 	up	and	i	got	 quit 	 e 	 	 animate 	 d 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	 d 	 inner 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	i	think	that	the	 conserv 	 ation 	 	community	might	embrace	 th 	 is 	 	idea	,	 mini 	 ster 	 	.	``
he	 pause 	 d 	 	and	put	his	 hand 	 s 	 	together	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	greg	,	but	the	devil	will	be	in	the	 detail 	 s 	 	,	``	he	 s 	 aid 	 	.
and	it	 certain 	 ly 	 	was	.
the	last	10	 year 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	detail	after	detail	ranging	from	creating	 legisl 	 ation 	 	to	 multi 	 ple 	 	research	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 s 	 	to	communication	 plan 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 team 	 s 	 	of	 lawyer 	 s 	 	,	mous	,	creating	the	phoenix	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	trust	board	.
and	we	are	now	in	the	process	of	raising	the	full	 end 	 ow 	 ment 	 	.
kiribati	 ha 	 s 	 	 froze 	 n 	 	 ex 	 tract 	 ing 	 	 activ 	 ities 	 	at	 it 	 s 	 	current	state	while	we	raise	the	 end 	 ow 	 ment 	 	.
we	just	had	our	first	pipa	trust	board	 meet 	 ing 	 	three	 week 	 s 	 	ago	.
so	it	's	a	fully	functional	up	-	and	-	running	 ent 	 ity 	 	that	 negoti 	 ates 	 	the	reverse	 fish 	 ing 	 	 licens 	 e 	 	with	the	country	.
and	the	pipa	trust	board	 hold 	 s 	 	that	 licens 	 e 	 	and	 pay 	 s 	 	the	country	for	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	solid	,	 ver 	 y 	 	well	thought	-	out	,	 ver 	 y 	 	well	 ground 	 ed 	 	system	,
and	it	was	a	bottom	-	up	system	,	and	that	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	work	,	from	the	bottom	up	to	secure	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	the	 condition 	 s 	 	for	success	here	are	 list 	 ed 	 	.
you	can	read	them	 your 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
but	i	would	say	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	one	in	my	mind	was	 work 	 ing 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	market	 force 	 s 	 	of	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
and	that	 insur 	 ed 	 	that	we	could	move	 th 	 is 	 	forward	and	it	would	have	both	the	self	-	interest	of	kiribati	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	the	self	-	interest	of	the	world	.
and	i	'll	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	one	final	slide	,	that	is	:	how	do	we	scale	 th 	 is 	 	up	?
how	do	we	 real 	 ize 	 	sylvia	's	dream	?
where	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	do	we	take	 th 	 is 	 	?
here	's	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	with	large	mpas	and	large	 conserv 	 ation 	 	 zone 	 s 	 	on	it	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	we	have	a	 patch 	 work 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	 th 	 is 	 	ocean	.
i	've	just	 de 	 scribed 	 	to	you	the	one	story	 be 	 hind 	 	that	 rect 	 angular 	 	area	in	the	middle	,	the	phoenix	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	,	but	every	other	green	patch	on	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	own	story	.
and	what	we	need	to	do	now	is	look	at	the	whole	 pac 	 ific 	 	ocean	in	 it 	 s 	 	 entire 	 ty 	 	and	make	a	network	of	mpas	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	so	that	we	have	our	world	's	largest	ocean	 protect 	 ed 	 	and	self	-	 sustain 	 ing 	 	over	time	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
