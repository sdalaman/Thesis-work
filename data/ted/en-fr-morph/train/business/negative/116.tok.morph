how	 man 	 y 	 	 creation 	 ists 	 	do	we	have	in	the	room	?
 prob 	 ably 	 	 non 	 e 	 	.	i	think	we	're	all	darwinians	.
and	yet	 man 	 y 	 	darwinians	are	 anx 	 ious 	 	,	a	little	 un 	 easy 	 	--	would	like	to	see	some	 limit 	 s 	 	on	just	how	far	the	darwinism	 go 	 es 	 	.
you	know	 spider 	 web 	 s 	 	?	 s 	 ure 	 	,	they	are	 product 	 s 	 	of	evolution	.
the	world	wide	web	?	not	so	 s 	 ure 	 	.
 be 	 a 	 ver 	 	 dam 	 s 	 	,	 y 	 es 	 	.	 ho 	 over 	 	dam	,	no	.
what	do	they	think	it	is	that	 prevent 	 s 	 	the	 product 	 s 	 	of	human	 ing 	 en 	 u 	 ity 	 	from	 be 	 ing 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	 fruit 	 s 	 	of	the	tree	of	life	,	and	 h 	 ence 	 	,	in	some	sense	,	 obey 	 ing 	 	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 rule 	 s 	 	?
and	yet	people	are	 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	resistant	to	the	idea	of	 app 	 ly 	 ing 	 	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	to	 think 	 ing 	 	--	to	our	 think 	 ing 	 	.
and	so	i	'm	going	to	talk	a	little	bit	about	that	,	 keep 	 ing 	 	in	mind	that	we	have	a	lot	on	the	program	here	.
so	you	're	out	in	the	 wood 	 s 	 	,	or	you	're	out	in	the	 past 	 ure 	 	,	and	you	see	 th 	 is 	 	ant	 crawl 	 ing 	 	up	 th 	 is 	 	blade	of	grass	.
it	 climb 	 s 	 	up	to	the	top	,	and	it	 fall 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 climb 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 fall 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 climb 	 s 	 	--
 try 	 ing 	 	to	stay	at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	top	of	the	blade	of	grass	.
what	is	 th 	 is 	 	ant	 do 	 ing 	 	?	what	is	 th 	 is 	 	in	aid	of	?
what	 goal 	 s 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	ant	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	by	 climb 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	blade	of	grass	?
what	's	in	it	for	the	ant	?
and	the	answer	is	:	 noth 	 ing 	 	.	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	in	it	for	the	ant	.
well	then	,	why	is	it	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	?
is	it	just	a	 flu 	 ke 	 	?
 yea 	 h 	 	,	it	's	just	a	 flu 	 ke 	 	.	it	's	a	 lance 	 t 	 	 flu 	 ke 	 	.
it	's	a	little	brain	worm	.
it	's	a	 parasit 	 ic 	 	brain	worm	that	 ha 	 s 	 	to	get	 in 	 to 	 	the	stomach	of	a	sheep	or	a	cow	in	order	to	 continu 	 e 	 	 it 	 s 	 	life	cycle	.
 s 	 al 	 mon 	 	swim	 up 	 stream 	 	to	get	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 spawn 	 ing 	 	 ground 	 s 	 	,	and	 lance 	 t 	 	 flu 	 ke 	 s 	 	 command 	 eer 	 	a	 pass 	 ing 	 	ant	,	crawl	 in 	 to 	 	 it 	 s 	 	brain	,	and	drive	it	up	a	blade	of	grass	like	an	all	-	 terra 	 in 	 	vehicle	.
so	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	in	it	for	the	ant	.
the	ant	's	brain	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 hijack 	 ed 	 	by	a	 parasit 	 e 	 	that	 infect 	 s 	 	the	brain	,	 in 	 duc 	 ing 	 	 sui 	 cidal 	 	behavior	.
 pre 	 tty 	 	 scar 	 y 	 	.
well	,	 do 	 es 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	like	that	happen	with	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	all	on	 be 	 half 	 	of	a	cause	other	than	one	's	own	genetic	 fit 	 ness 	 	,	of	course	.
well	,	it	may	 al 	 ready 	 	have	 occur 	 red 	 	to	you	that	islam	 mean 	 s 	 	``	surrender	,	``	or	``	 sub 	 mission 	 	of	self	-	interest	to	the	will	of	allah	.	``
well	,	it	's	 idea 	 s 	 	--	not	 worm 	 s 	 	--	that	hijack	our	 brain 	 s 	 	.
now	,	am	i	 say 	 ing 	 	that	a	 s 	 izable 	 	 minor 	 ity 	 	of	the	world	's	population	 ha 	 s 	 	had	 the 	 ir 	 	brain	 hijack 	 ed 	 	by	 parasit 	 ic 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	?
no	,	it	's	 wo 	 rse 	 	than	that	.
most	people	have	.
there	are	a	lot	of	 idea 	 s 	 	to	die	for	.
 free 	 dom 	 	,	if	you	're	from	new	hampshire	.
justice	.	truth	.	 commun 	 ism 	 	.
 man 	 y 	 	people	have	laid	down	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	for	 commun 	 ism 	 	,
and	 man 	 y 	 	have	laid	down	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	for	 capital 	 ism 	 	.
and	 man 	 y 	 	for	catholicism	.	and	 man 	 y 	 	for	islam	.
these	are	just	a	few	of	the	 idea 	 s 	 	that	are	to	die	for	.
they	're	 infect 	 ious 	 	.
 yester 	 day 	 	,	amory	lovins	spoke	about	``	 infect 	 ious 	 	 re 	 pit 	 itis 	 	.	``	it	was	a	term	of	abuse	,	in	effect	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 un 	 think 	 ing 	 	 engineer 	 ing 	 	.
well	,	most	of	the	cultural	spread	that	 go 	 es 	 	on	is	not	 brilli 	 ant 	 	,	new	,	out	-	of	-	the	-	box	 think 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	``	 infect 	 ious 	 	 repetit 	 is 	 	,	``
and	we	might	 a 	 s 	 	well	try	to	have	a	 theor 	 y 	 	of	what	's	going	on	when	that	 happen 	 s 	 	so	that	we	can	understand	the	 condition 	 s 	 	of	 infect 	 ion 	 	.
 host 	 s 	 	work	hard	to	spread	these	 idea 	 s 	 	to	 other 	 s 	 	.
i	 my 	 self 	 	am	a	 philosoph 	 er 	 	,	and	one	of	our	 occupation 	 al 	 	 hazard 	 s 	 	is	that	people	ask	us	what	the	meaning	of	life	is	.
and	you	have	to	have	a	 bump 	 er 	 	 stick 	 er 	 	,	you	know	.	you	have	to	have	a	 state 	 ment 	 	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	mine	.	the	secret	of	happiness	is	:	find	 some 	 thing 	 	more	 import 	 ant 	 	than	you	are	and	dedicate	your	life	to	it	.
most	of	us	--	now	that	the	``	me	decade	``	is	well	in	the	past	--	now	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
one	set	of	 idea 	 s 	 	or	 an 	 other 	 	have	 simpl 	 y 	 	 replace 	 d 	 	our	 bio 	 logical 	 	 imper 	 ative 	 s 	 	in	our	own	 live 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	our	 summ 	 um 	 	 bon 	 um 	 	is	.
it	's	not	 maxim 	 izing 	 	the	number	of	 grand 	 children 	 	we	have	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 pro 	 found 	 	 bio 	 logical 	 	effect	.
it	's	the	 sub 	 ordin 	 ation 	 	of	genetic	interest	to	other	 interest 	 s 	 	.
and	no	other	species	 do 	 es 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	at	all	like	it	.
well	,	how	are	we	going	to	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	?
it	is	,	on	the	one	hand	,	a	 bio 	 logical 	 	effect	,	and	a	 ver 	 y 	 	large	one	.
 un 	 mistak 	 able 	 	.
now	,	what	 the 	 ories 	 	do	we	want	to	use	to	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	?
well	,	 man 	 y 	 	 the 	 ories 	 	.	but	how	could	 some 	 thing 	 	tie	them	together	?
the	idea	of	 replica 	 ting 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	;	 idea 	 s 	 	that	replicate	by	 pass 	 ing 	 	from	brain	to	brain	.
richard	dawkins	,	whom	you	'll	be	 hear 	 ing 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	in	the	day	,	 invent 	 ed 	 	the	term	``	 meme 	 s 	 	,	``	and	put	forward	the	first	 re 	 ally 	 	clear	and	 vivi 	 d 	 	version	of	 th 	 is 	 	idea	in	his	book	``	the	 self 	 ish 	 	gene	.	``
now	here	am	i	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	his	idea	.
well	,	you	see	,	it	's	not	his	.	 y 	 es 	 	--	he	 start 	 ed 	 	it	.
but	it	's	 every 	 body 	 	's	idea	now	.
and	he	's	not	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	what	i	say	about	 meme 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	what	i	say	about	 meme 	 s 	 	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	think	we	're	all	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	not	just	the	 intend 	 ed 	 	 effect 	 s 	 	of	our	 idea 	 s 	 	,	but	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 like 	 ly 	 	 mis 	 uses 	 	.
so	it	is	 import 	 ant 	 	,	i	think	,	to	richard	,	and	to	me	,	that	these	 idea 	 s 	 	not	be	 abuse 	 d 	 	and	 mis 	 used 	 	.
they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	to	 mis 	 use 	 	.	that	's	why	they	're	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
and	it	's	just	about	a	full	-	time	job	 try 	 ing 	 	to	prevent	people	who	are	 scar 	 ed 	 	of	these	 idea 	 s 	 	from	 caricatur 	 ing 	 	them	and	then	running	off	to	one	 di 	 re 	 	purpose	or	 an 	 other 	 	.
so	we	have	to	keep	 plug 	 ging 	 	away	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	correct	the	 mis 	 apprehens 	 ions 	 	so	that	 on 	 ly 	 	the	benign	and	 use 	 ful 	 	 vari 	 ants 	 	of	our	 idea 	 s 	 	 continu 	 e 	 	to	spread	.
but	it	is	a	problem	.
we	do	n't	have	much	time	,	and	i	'm	going	to	go	over	just	a	little	bit	of	 th 	 is 	 	and	cut	out	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	a	lot	of	other	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	going	to	be	 s 	 aid 	 	.
so	let	me	just	point	out	:	 meme 	 s 	 	are	like	viruses	.
that	's	what	richard	 s 	 aid 	 	,	back	in	'93	.
and	you	might	think	,	``	well	,	how	can	that	be	?
i	mean	,	a	virus	is	--	you	know	,	it	's	stuff	!	what	's	a	meme	made	of	?	``
 yester 	 day 	 	,	negroponte	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	viral	 tele 	 communication 	 s 	 	but	--	what	's	a	virus	?
a	virus	is	a	string	of	 nuclei 	 c 	 	acid	with	attitude	.
that	is	,	there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	about	it	that	 tend 	 s 	 	to	make	it	replicate	better	than	the	 com 	 petition 	 	 do 	 es 	 	.	and	that	's	what	a	meme	is	.	it	's	an	information	 pack 	 et 	 	with	attitude	.
what	's	a	meme	made	of	?	what	are	bits	made	of	,	mom	?
not	silicon	.
they	're	made	of	information	,	and	can	be	carried	in	any	physical	medium	.
what	's	a	word	made	of	?
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	when	people	say	,	``	do	 meme 	 s 	 	exist	?	``
i	say	,	``	well	,	do	 word 	 s 	 	exist	?	are	they	in	your	 onto 	 logy 	 	?	``
if	they	are	,	 word 	 s 	 	are	 meme 	 s 	 	that	can	be	 pronounce 	 d 	 	.
then	there	's	all	the	other	 meme 	 s 	 	that	ca	n't	be	 pronounce 	 d 	 	.
there	are	different	species	of	 meme 	 s 	 	.
remember	the	 shake 	 rs 	 	?	gift	to	be	simple	?
simple	,	 beaut 	 iful 	 	furniture	?
and	,	of	course	,	they	're	 bas 	 ically 	 	extinct	now	.
and	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	is	that	among	the	 cre 	 ed 	 	of	 shake 	 r 	 	-	dom	is	that	one	should	be	 celib 	 ate 	 	.
not	just	the	 priest 	 s 	 	.	 every 	 body 	 	.
well	,	it	's	not	so	surprising	that	they	've	gone	extinct	.
but	in	fact	that	's	not	why	they	went	extinct	.
they	 surviv 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	they	did	at	a	time	when	the	social	 safe 	 ty 	 	 net 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	n't	there	.
and	there	 we 	 re 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 widow 	 s 	 	and	 orphan 	 s 	 	,	people	like	that	,	who	 need 	 ed 	 	a	foster	home	.
and	so	they	had	a	ready	supply	of	 convert 	 s 	 	.
and	they	could	keep	it	going	.
and	,	in	principle	,	it	could	've	gone	on	 fore 	 ver 	 	,
with	perfect	 celib 	 acy 	 	on	the	part	of	the	 host 	 s 	 	.
the	idea	 be 	 ing 	 	 pass 	 ed 	 	on	through	 pro 	 s 	 e 	 ly 	 tizing 	 	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	through	the	gene	line	.
so	the	 idea 	 s 	 	can	live	on	in	spite	of	the	fact	that	they	're	not	 be 	 ing 	 	 pass 	 ed 	 	on	 genetic 	 ally 	 	.
a	meme	can	flourish	in	spite	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	negative	impact	on	genetic	 fit 	 ness 	 	.
after	all	,	the	meme	for	 shake 	 r 	 	-	dom	was	 essential 	 ly 	 	a	 steril 	 izing 	 	 parasit 	 e 	 	.
there	are	other	 parasit 	 es 	 	that	do	 th 	 is 	 	--	which	render	the	host	 steril 	 e 	 	.
it	's	part	of	 the 	 ir 	 	plan	.
they	do	n't	have	to	have	 mind 	 s 	 	to	have	a	plan	.
i	'm	just	going	to	draw	your	attention	to	just	one	of	the	 man 	 y 	 	 implic 	 ations 	 	of	the	 meme 	 tic 	 	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	which	i	recommend	.
i	've	not	time	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	more	of	it	.
in	jared	diamond	's	 wonder 	 ful 	 	book	,	``	 gun 	 s 	 	,	 germ 	 s 	 	and	steel	,	``	he	 talk 	 s 	 	about	how	it	was	 germ 	 s 	 	,	more	than	 gun 	 s 	 	and	steel	,	that	 conquer 	 ed 	 	the	new	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	--	the	western	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	--
that	 conquer 	 ed 	 	the	rest	of	the	world	.
when	european	 explore 	 rs 	 	and	 travel 	 ers 	 	spread	out	,	they	 br 	 ought 	 	with	them	the	 germ 	 s 	 	that	they	had	 be 	 come 	 	 essential 	 ly 	 	 immun 	 e 	 	to	,	that	they	had	 learn 	 ed 	 	how	to	 toler 	 ate 	 	over	 hundred 	 s 	 	and	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	of	living	with	 domestic 	 ated 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	the	 source 	 s 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 pathogen 	 s 	 	.
and	they	just	 wipe 	 d 	 	out	--	these	 pathogen 	 s 	 	just	 wipe 	 d 	 	out	the	native	people	,	who	had	no	 immun 	 ity 	 	to	them	at	all	.
and	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	 aga 	 in 	 	.
we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	 th 	 is 	 	time	with	toxic	 idea 	 s 	 	.
 yester 	 day 	 	,	a	number	of	people	--	nicholas	negroponte	and	 other 	 s 	 	--	spoke	about	all	the	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 happen 	 ing 	 	when	our	 idea 	 s 	 	get	spread	out	,	 thank 	 s 	 	to	all	the	new	technology	all	over	the	world	.
and	i	agree	.	it	is	 large 	 ly 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	.	 large 	 ly 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	.
but	among	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	that	 inevit 	 ably 	 	flow	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	whole	world	 thank 	 s 	 	to	our	technology	,	are	a	lot	of	toxic	 idea 	 s 	 	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 real 	 ized 	 	for	some	time	.
sayyid	qutb	is	one	of	the	 found 	 ing 	 	 father 	 s 	 	of	 fanatic 	 al 	 	islam	,	one	of	the	 ideo 	 logues 	 	that	inspired	osama	bin	laden	.

these	 meme 	 s 	 	are	 spread 	 ing 	 	around	the	world	and	they	are	 wi 	 ping 	 	out	whole	 culture 	 s 	 	.
they	are	 wi 	 ping 	 	out	 language 	 s 	 	.
they	are	 wi 	 ping 	 	out	 tradition 	 s 	 	and	 practice 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	not	our	fault	,	 any 	 more 	 	than	it	's	our	fault	when	our	 germ 	 s 	 	lay	waste	to	people	that	have	n't	 develop 	 ed 	 	the	 immun 	 ity 	 	.
we	have	an	 immun 	 ity 	 	to	all	of	the	junk	that	lies	around	the	 edge 	 s 	 	of	our	culture	.
we	're	a	free	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	so	we	let	 porn 	 ography 	 	and	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	--	we	shrug	them	off	.
they	're	like	a	mild	cold	.
they	're	not	a	big	deal	for	us	.
but	we	should	 recogn 	 ize 	 	that	for	 man 	 y 	 	people	in	the	world	,	they	are	a	big	deal	.
and	we	should	be	 ver 	 y 	 	alert	to	 th 	 is 	 	.	 a 	 s 	 	we	spread	our	education	and	our	technology	,	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	are	 do 	 ing 	 	is	we	're	the	 vector 	 s 	 	of	 meme 	 s 	 	that	are	 correct 	 ly 	 	 view 	 ed 	 	by	the	 host 	 s 	 	of	 man 	 y 	 	other	 meme 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 di 	 re 	 	threat	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 favor 	 ite 	 	 meme 	 s 	 	--	the	 meme 	 s 	 	that	they	are	prepared	to	die	for	.
well	now	,	how	are	we	going	to	tell	the	good	 meme 	 s 	 	from	the	bad	 meme 	 s 	 	?
that	is	not	the	job	of	the	science	of	 meme 	 tics 	 	.
 meme 	 tics 	 	is	 moral 	 ly 	 	neutral	.	and	so	it	should	be	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	the	place	for	hate	and	anger	.
if	you	've	had	a	friend	who	's	 di 	 ed 	 	of	 aid 	 s 	 	,	then	you	hate	hiv	.
but	the	way	to	deal	with	that	is	to	do	science	,	and	understand	how	it	 spread 	 s 	 	and	why	in	a	 moral 	 ly 	 	neutral	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	.
get	the	 fact 	 s 	 	.
work	out	the	 implic 	 ations 	 	.
there	's	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	room	for	moral	 pass 	 ion 	 	once	we	've	got	the	 fact 	 s 	 	and	can	figure	out	the	best	thing	to	do	.
and	,	 a 	 s 	 	with	 germ 	 s 	 	,	the	trick	is	not	to	try	to	 annihil 	 ate 	 	them	.
you	will	never	 annihil 	 ate 	 	the	 germ 	 s 	 	.
