i	just	came	back	from	a	community	that	 hold 	 s 	 	the	secret	to	human	 surviv 	 al 	 	.
it	's	a	place	where	women	run	the	show	,	have	 s 	 ex 	 	to	say	 hell 	 o 	 	,	and	play	 rule 	 s 	 	the	day	--	where	 f 	 un 	 	is	serious	business	.
and	no	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	 burn 	 ing 	 	man	or	san	francisco	.
 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	meet	your	 cousin 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	world	of	wild	 bono 	 bo 	 s 	 	in	the	 jungle 	 s 	 	of	congo	.
 bono 	 bo 	 s 	 	are	,	together	with	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	,	your	living	 close 	 st 	 	 relat 	 ive 	 	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	we	all	share	a	common	 ance 	 s 	 tor 	 	,	an	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 grand 	 mother 	 	,	who	lived	around	six	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
now	,	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	are	well	-	known	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 aggress 	 ion 	 	.
but	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	we	have	made	too	much	of	an	 emphas 	 is 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 spect 	 	in	our	 narrative 	 s 	 	of	human	evolution	.
but	 bono 	 bo 	 s 	 	show	us	the	other	side	of	the	 co 	 in 	 	.
while	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	are	 dominate 	 d 	 	by	big	,	 scar 	 y 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	,	bonobo	 socie 	 ty 	 	is	run	by	 empower 	 ed 	 	 female 	 s 	 	.	these	 guy 	 s 	 	have	 re 	 ally 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	out	,	since	 th 	 is 	 	 lead 	 s 	 	to	a	 high 	 ly 	 	 toler 	 ant 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	where	fatal	violence	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 be 	 en 	 	 observ 	 ed 	 	yet	.
but	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	 bono 	 bo 	 s 	 	are	the	 l 	 east 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	of	the	great	 ape 	 s 	 	.
they	live	in	the	 depth 	 s 	 	of	the	congolese	jungle	,	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	to	 stud 	 y 	 	them	.
the	congo	is	a	paradox	--	a	land	of	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 bio 	 divers 	 ity 	 	and	 beaut 	 y 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	the	heart	of	 dark 	 ness 	 	 it 	 self 	 	--	the	scene	of	a	violent	conflict	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 rag 	 ed 	 	for	 decade 	 s 	 	and	 claim 	 ed 	 	 near 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 live 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	first	world	war	.
not	 surprising 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 destruct 	 ion 	 	 al 	 so 	 	_UNK_	bonobo	 surviv 	 al 	 	.
_UNK_	 trade 	 s 	 	and	forest	loss	 mean 	 s 	 	we	could	n't	fill	a	small	 stad 	 ium 	 	with	all	the	 bono 	 bo 	 s 	 	that	are	left	in	the	world	--	and	we	're	not	even	 s 	 ure 	 	of	that	to	be	honest	.
yet	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	land	of	violence	and	 cha 	 os 	 	,	you	can	hear	 hid 	 den 	 	laughter	 s 	 way 	 ing 	 	the	 tree 	 s 	 	.
who	are	these	 cousin 	 s 	 	?
we	know	them	 a 	 s 	 	the	``	make	love	,	not	war	``	 ape 	 s 	 	since	they	have	frequent	,	 promisc 	 uous 	 	and	_UNK_	 s 	 ex 	 
to	manage	conflict	and	solve	social	 issue 	 s 	 	.
now	,	i	'm	not	 say 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	solution	to	all	of	 human 	 ity 	 	's	 problem 	 s 	 	--	since	there	's	more	to	bonobo	life	than	the	_UNK_	sutra	.
 bono 	 bo 	 s 	 	,	like	 human 	 s 	 	,	love	to	play	 through 	 out 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	entire	 live 	 s 	 	.
play	is	not	just	child	's	 game 	 s 	 	.
for	us	and	them	,	play	is	foundational	for	 bond 	 ing 	 	 relationship 	 s 	 	and	 foster 	 ing 	 	 toler 	 ance 	 	.
it	's	where	we	learn	to	trust	and	where	we	learn	about	the	 rule 	 s 	 	of	the	game	.
play	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	and	 resili 	 ence 	 	,	and	it	's	all	about	the	generation	of	 divers 	 ity 	 	--	 divers 	 ity 	 	of	 interact 	 ions 	 	,	 divers 	 ity 	 	of	 behavior 	 s 	 	,	 divers 	 ity 	 	of	 connect 	 ions 	 	.
and	when	you	watch	bonobo	play	,	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 root 	 s 	 	of	human	laughter	,	dance	and	ritual	.
play	is	the	glue	that	 bind 	 s 	 	us	together	.
now	,	i	do	n't	know	how	you	play	,	but	i	want	to	show	you	a	couple	of	 un 	 ique 	 	 clip 	 s 	 	fresh	from	the	wild	.
first	,	it	's	a	ball	game	bonobo	-	style	--	and	i	do	not	mean	 foot 	 ball 	 	.
so	here	,	we	have	a	young	female	and	a	male	 engag 	 ed 	 	in	a	chase	game	.
have	a	look	what	she	's	 do 	 ing 	 	.
it	might	be	the	 evolution 	 ary 	 	origin	of	the	phrase	,	``	she	's	got	him	by	the	 ball 	 s 	 	.	``
 on 	 ly 	 	i	think	that	he	's	 ra 	 ther 	 	loving	it	here	,	right	?
 yea 	 h 	 	.
so	 s 	 ex 	 	play	is	common	in	both	 bono 	 bo 	 s 	 	and	 human 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	video	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 show 	 s 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	video	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 show 	 s 	 	the	_UNK_	of	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	 un 	 usual 	 	 element 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	play	--	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 test 	 icles 	 	--	and	 al 	 so 	 	how	play	both	 requir 	 es 	 	trust	and	fosters	trust	--	while	at	the	same	time	 be 	 ing 	 	tremendous	 f 	 un 	 	.
but	play	's	a	shapeshifter	.
play	's	a	shapeshifter	,	and	it	can	take	 man 	 y 	 	 form 	 s 	 	,	some	of	which	are	more	quiet	,	 imagin 	 ative 	 	,	 cur 	 ious 	 	--	 may 	 be 	 	where	wonder	is	 discover 	 ed 	 	 a 	 new 	 	.
and	i	want	you	to	see	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	_UNK_	,	a	young	female	,	and	she	is	 quiet 	 ly 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	with	water	.
i	think	,	like	her	,	we	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	play	 al 	 one 	 	,	and	we	explore	the	 bound 	 aries 	 	of	our	inner	and	our	 out 	 er 	 	 world 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	that	 play 	 ful 	 	curiosity	that	 drive 	 s 	 	us	to	explore	,	 drive 	 s 	 	us	to	interact	,	and	then	the	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	 connect 	 ions 	 	we	form	are	the	real	 hot 	 bed 	 	for	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	.
so	these	are	just	small	_UNK_	 in 	 to 	 	the	 in 	 sight 	 s 	 	that	bonobo	give	us	to	our	past	and	present	.
but	they	 al 	 so 	 	hold	a	secret	for	our	future	,	a	future	where	we	need	to	adapt	to	an	 increasing 	 ly 	 	 challeng 	 ing 	 	world	through	 great 	 er 	 	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	and	 great 	 er 	 	 co 	 operation 	 	.
the	secret	is	that	play	is	the	key	to	these	 cap 	 a 	 cities 	 	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	play	is	our	 adapt 	 ive 	 	 wild 	 card 	 	.
in	order	to	adapt	 success 	 fully 	 	to	a	changing	world	,	we	need	to	play	.
but	will	we	make	the	most	of	our	 play 	 fulness 	 	?
play	is	not	frivolous	.	play	's	essential	.
for	 bono 	 bo 	 s 	 	and	 human 	 s 	 	 a 	 like 	 	,	life	is	not	just	red	in	tooth	and	claw	.
in	 time 	 s 	 	when	it	 seem 	 s 	 	 l 	 east 	 	appropriate	to	play	,	it	might	be	the	 time 	 s 	 	when	it	is	most	 urge 	 nt 	 	.
and	so	,	my	fellow	 prim 	 ates 	 	,	let	us	embrace	 th 	 is 	 	gift	from	evolution	and	play	together	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	 re 	 discover 	 	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	,	 fellow 	 ship 	 	and	wonder	.
thank	you	.
