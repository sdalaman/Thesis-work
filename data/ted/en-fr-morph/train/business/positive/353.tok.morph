good	 morn 	 ing 	 	.	my	name	is	david	rose	.
i	am	a	 s 	 erial 	 	entrepreneur	 turn 	 ed 	 	 s 	 erial 	 	 invest 	 or 	 	.
and	by	the	use	of	 pitch 	 ing 	 	powerpoints	to	vcs	,	i	have	 personal 	 ly 	 	raised	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	from	vcs	through	powerpoint	 pitch 	 es 	 	.
and	then	,	 turn 	 ing 	 	round	to	the	other	side	of	the	 equ 	 ation 	 	,	i	have	 personal 	 ly 	 	 supervise 	 d 	 	the	 invest 	 ment 	 	of	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	who	have	 be 	 en 	 	 pitch 	 ing 	 	me	with	powerpoint	 present 	 ations 	 	.
so	i	think	it	's	safe	to	say	i	know	a	little	bit	about	the	process	of	 pitch 	 ing 	 	.
so	,	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	question	that	you	've	all	got	to	figure	out	is	:	what	is	the	single	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	that	a	vc	is	looking	for	when	you	come	to	them	 pitch 	 ing 	 	your	new	business	idea	?
and	there	are	 obvious 	 ly 	 	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
there	are	business	 model 	 s 	 	,	and	there	are	 financial 	 s 	 	,	and	there	are	 market 	 s 	 	and	there	is	that	.	 over 	 all 	 	,	of	all	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	have	to	do	,	what	is	the	single	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	the	vc	 some 	 body 	 	?	what	?
david	s.	rose	:	people	?	you	!	that	's	it	--	you	are	the	person	.
and	so	 there 	 fore 	 	,	the	entire	purpose	of	a	vc	pitch	is	to	 con 	 vince 	 	them	that	you	are	the	entrepreneur	in	whom	they	are	going	to	invest	 the 	 ir 	 	money	and	make	a	lot	of	money	in	return	.
now	,	how	do	you	do	 th 	 is 	 	?
you	ca	n't	just	walk	up	and	say	,	you	know	,	``	hi	,	i	'm	a	 re 	 ally 	 	good	guy	,	and	a	good	girl	,	and	you	should	 re 	 ally 	 	invest	in	me	.	``	right	?
so	,	in	the	course	of	your	vc	pitch	,	you	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	few	 minute 	 s 	 	,	and	most	vc	 pitch 	 es 	 	--	most	angel	 pitch 	 es 	 	are	about	15	 minute 	 s 	 	,	most	vc	 pitch 	 es 	 	should	be	less	than	half	an	hour	.	people	's	attention	span	after	18	 minute 	 s 	 	 begin 	 s 	 	to	drop	off	,
 test 	 s 	 	have	 show 	 n 	 	.
so	in	that	18	 minute 	 s 	 	,	or	10	 minute 	 s 	 	,	or	five	 minute 	 s 	 	,	you	have	to	convey	a	whole	bunch	of	different	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	.
you	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	to	convey	about	10	different	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	while	you	're	 stand 	 ing 	 	up	there	.
what	's	the	single	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	you	've	got	to	convey	?
what	?
dsr	:	boy	,	oh	boy	,	oh	boy	!	and	that	's	a	straight	line	we	got	right	over	there	.	and	i	did	n't	even	prompt	him	.
you	're	right	,	 integ 	 r 	 ity 	 	.	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	the	key	thing	.
i	would	much	 ra 	 ther 	 	invest	in	 some 	 body 	 	--	you	know	,	take	a	chance	on	 some 	 body 	 	--	who	i	know	is	straight	than	 some 	 body 	 	where	there	's	any	possible	question	of	,	you	know	,	who	are	they	looking	out	for	,	and	what	's	going	on	.
so	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	is	 integ 	 r 	 ity 	 	.
and	what	's	the	second	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	after	 integ 	 r 	 ity 	 	?
let	's	see	if	you	can	get	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
dsr	:	close	 en 	 ough 	 	!	 pass 	 ion 	 	.
right	,	so	here	you	want	--	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	by	definition	are	people	who	are	 leav 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	else	,	 start 	 ing 	 	a	new	world	over	here	,	creating	and	 put 	 ting 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 life 	 blood 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	thing	.
you	've	got	to	convey	 pass 	 ion 	 	.
if	you	're	not	passionate	about	your	own	company	,	why	on	earth	should	 any 	 one 	 	else	be	passionate	?
why	should	they	put	more	money	 in 	 to 	 	your	company	,	if	you	're	not	passionate	about	it	?
so	,	 integ 	 r 	 ity 	 	and	 pass 	 ion 	 	:	the	single	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	out	there	.
then	there	are	a	whole	 pan 	 op 	 ly 	 	of	other	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	've	got	to	do	,	to	wrap	up	in	 th 	 is 	 	package	that	you	're	 present 	 ing 	 	to	a	vc	.
experience	.
you	've	got	to	be	able	to	say	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	you	know	,	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	before	.	``
and	``	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	before	``	is	 start 	 ing 	 	an	enterprise	and	creating	value	,	and	taking	 some 	 thing 	 	from	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	end	.
so	that	's	why	vcs	love	to	fund	 s 	 erial 	 	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	even	if	you	did	n't	do	it	right	the	first	time	,	you	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	the	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	,	which	are	going	to	stand	you	in	 ver 	 y 	 	good	stead	the	next	time	.
and	now	 a 	 long 	 	with	that	,	 a 	 long 	 	with	the	experience	of	 start 	 ing 	 	an	enterprise	,	or	running	 some 	 thing 	 	--	and	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	to	be	a	business	.	it	can	be	in	an	 organ 	 ization 	 	at	school	,	it	can	be	a	not	-	for	-	profit	.	but	they	want	experience	in	creating	an	 organ 	 ization 	 	.
next	up	is	knowledge	.
if	you	're	 tell 	 ing 	 	me	you	're	going	to	be	the	great	 develop 	 er 	 	of	the	map	of	the	human	genome	,	you	'd	better	know	what	a	human	genome	is	.
i	mean	,	i	want	you	to	have	domain	 expert 	 ise 	 	.
so	i	do	n't	want	 some 	 body 	 	who	's	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	i	've	got	a	great	idea	in	a	business	i	know	 noth 	 ing 	 	about	.	i	do	n't	know	who	the	 player 	 s 	 	are	.	i	do	n't	know	what	the	market	is	like	.	``
so	you	've	got	to	know	your	market	.
you	've	got	to	know	your	area	.
and	then	you	have	to	have	the	 skill 	 s 	 	that	it	 take 	 s 	 	to	get	a	company	going	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	include	 every 	 thing 	 	from	technical	 skill 	 s 	 	,	if	it	's	a	technology	business	,	to	 market 	 ing 	 	,	and	 sale 	 s 	 	,	and	management	,	and	so	on	.
but	,	you	know	,	not	 every 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	all	these	 skill 	 s 	 	.
there	are	 ver 	 y 	 	few	people	who	have	the	full	set	of	 skill 	 s 	 	that	it	 take 	 s 	 	to	run	a	company	.
so	what	else	do	you	 requir 	 e 	 	?
well	,	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	.
you	've	got	to	be	able	to	 con 	 vince 	 	us	that	you	either	have	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	team	that	 ha 	 s 	 	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 factor 	 s 	 	in	it	,	or	else	you	can	.
and	you	have	the	charisma	and	the	management	style	and	the	ability	to	get	people	to	follow	your	lead	,	to	inspire	them	,	to	 motiv 	 ate 	 	them	to	be	part	of	your	team	.
all	right	,	then	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	all	that	,	what	else	do	i	want	to	know	 a 	 s 	 	a	vc	?
i	want	to	know	that	you	have	 commit 	 ment 	 	.
that	you	are	going	to	be	here	to	the	end	.
i	want	you	to	say	,	or	i	want	you	to	convey	,	that	you	are	going	to	die	if	you	have	to	,	with	your	 ver 	 y 	 	last	breath	,	with	your	 finger 	 nail 	 s 	 	 scratch 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	drag	you	out	.
you	're	going	to	keep	my	money	 al 	 ive 	 	and	you	're	going	to	make	more	money	out	of	it	.
so	i	do	n't	want	 some 	 body 	 	who	's	going	to	cut	and	run	at	the	first	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	bad	 thing 	 s 	 	happen	.
there	's	never	 be 	 en 	 	an	angel	-	or	a	venture	-	funded	company	where	bad	 thing 	 s 	 	did	n't	happen	.
so	i	want	to	know	that	you	're	 commit 	 ted 	 	to	be	there	to	the	 ver 	 y 	 	end	.
you	've	got	to	have	vision	.
you	've	got	to	be	able	to	see	where	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	.
i	do	n't	want	 an 	 other 	 	``	me	too	``	product	.
i	want	 some 	 body 	 	who	 know 	 s 	 	,	who	can	change	the	world	out	there	.
but	on	top	of	that	,	i	 al 	 so 	 	need	 real 	 ism 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	need	to	know	that	you	know	that	while	changing	the	world	is	great	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	happen	.
and	before	you	get	to	change	the	world	,	bad	 thing 	 s 	 	are	going	to	take	place	.
and	you	've	got	to	be	able	to	deal	with	that	.
and	you	have	to	have	rational	 project 	 ions 	 	and	stuff	.
and	then	 final 	 ly 	 	,	you	're	 ask 	 ing 	 	for	my	money	,	not	just	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	my	money	,	but	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	me	.
you	need	to	be	 coach 	 able 	 	.
so	i	need	to	know	that	you	have	the	ability	to	listen	.
we	've	had	a	lot	of	experience	.	people	who	are	vcs	or	 angel 	 s 	 	 invest 	 ing 	 	in	you	have	had	experience	and	they	'd	like	to	know	that	you	want	to	hear	that	experience	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	how	do	you	convey	all	these	10	 thing 	 s 	 	in	10	 minute 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	any	more	?
you	ca	n't	say	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	i	've	got	high	 integ 	 r 	 ity 	 	,	invest	in	me	!	``	right	?
you	've	got	to	do	a	whole	pitch	that	 convey 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 convey 	 ing 	 	it	.
so	think	about	your	pitch	 a 	 s 	 	a	 time 	 line 	 	.
it	 start 	 s 	 	off	,	you	walk	in	the	door	.
they	know	 noth 	 ing 	 	at	all	,	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	,	about	you	.
and	you	can	take	them	on	an	 emotion 	 al 	 	--	all	 pitch 	 es 	 	,	or	all	 sale 	 s 	 	 present 	 ations 	 	,	are	 emotion 	 al 	 	at	some	level	.
you	can	go	up	,	you	can	go	down	,	right	?
and	it	 go 	 es 	 	from	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	end	.
you	walk	in	the	door	.	so	the	first	thing	you	've	got	to	do	--	the	 over 	 all 	 	,	you	know	,	arc	of	your	 present 	 ation 	 	--	it	's	got	to	start	like	a	rocket	.
you	've	got	 may 	 be 	 	10	 second 	 s 	 	--	between	10	and	30	 second 	 s 	 	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	how	long	the	pitch	is	--	to	get	 the 	 ir 	 	attention	.
in	my	case	,	``	i	've	 invest 	 ed 	 	.	i	have	got	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	from	powerpoint	 pitch 	 es 	 	.
i	have	 invest 	 ed 	 	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	.	``
that	's	it	--	that	should	get	you	right	there	.
 th 	 is 	 	can	be	a	factor	,	and	 every 	 body 	 	can	be	 say 	 ing 	 	it	's	 counter 	 intuitive 	 	.	it	can	be	a	story	,	it	can	be	experience	.
but	you	've	got	to	grab	 the 	 ir 	 	 emotion 	 al 	 	attention	,	focused	on	you	,	 with 	 in 	 	that	first	few	 second 	 s 	 	.
and	then	from	there	,	you	've	got	to	take	them	on	a	 ver 	 y 	 	solid	,	 stead 	 y 	 	,	 up 	 ward 	 	path	,	right	from	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	end	.
and	 every 	 thing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	got	to	be	 re 	 in 	 forcing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	you	've	got	to	get	better	,	and	better	,	and	better	,	and	better	.
and	it	's	 revv 	 ing 	 	up	to	the	 ver 	 y 	 	end	,	and	then	at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	end	you	've	got	to	--	boom	!	--	knock	them	out	of	the	park	.
you	want	to	be	able	to	get	them	to	 s 	 uch 	 	an	 emotion 	 al 	 	high	that	they	are	ready	to	write	you	a	check	,	throw	money	at	you	,	right	there	before	you	 leav 	 e 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	how	do	you	do	that	?
well	,	first	of	all	,	logical	 progress 	 ion 	 	.
any	time	you	go	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	any	time	you	skip	a	step	--
imagine	 walk 	 ing 	 	up	a	 stair 	 case 	 	where	some	of	the	 tread 	 s 	 	are	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	,	or	the	 height 	 s 	 	are	different	 height 	 s 	 	.
you	stop	,	you	've	got	to	figure	it	out	.
you	want	a	nice	logical	 progress 	 ion 	 	.
start	with	 tell 	 ing 	 	them	what	the	market	is	.
why	are	you	going	to	do	x	,	y	or	z	.
and	then	you	've	got	to	tell	me	how	you	're	going	to	do	it	,	and	what	it	is	you	're	going	to	do	.	how	you	're	going	to	do	it	.
and	the	whole	--	it	's	got	to	flow	from	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	end	.
you	've	 al 	 so 	 	got	to	let	me	know	that	there	are	 touch 	 stone 	 s 	 	.
you	want	to	tie	in	to	the	rest	of	the	world	out	there	.
so	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	if	you	 re 	 ference 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	i	've	heard	of	,	or	 bas 	 ic 	 	 item 	 s 	 	in	your	business	,	i	want	to	know	about	them	.	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	can	 re 	 late 	 	to	:	 valid 	 ators 	 	,	or	 any 	 thing 	 	that	 tell 	 s 	 	me	 some 	 body 	 	else	 ha 	 s 	 	approved	 th 	 is 	 	,	or	there	's	 out 	 side 	 	 valid 	 ation 	 	.
it	can	be	 sale 	 s 	 	;	it	can	be	you	've	got	an	 a 	 ward 	 	for	 some 	 thing 	 	;	it	can	be	,	people	have	 d 	 one 	 	it	before	;	it	can	be	your	beta	 test 	 s 	 	are	going	great	.
 what 	 ever 	 	.	i	want	to	know	 valid 	 ation 	 	,	that	you	're	 tell 	 ing 	 	me	not	just	what	you	're	 tell 	 ing 	 	me	,	but	that	 some 	 body 	 	else	--	or	 some 	 thing 	 	else	out	there	--	 say 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 make 	 s 	 	sense	.
and	then	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	looking	for	the	 up 	 side 	 	here	,
i	've	got	to	have	 believ 	 able 	 	 up 	 side 	 	.
and	that	's	two	 part 	 s 	 	.
it	's	got	to	be	 up 	 side 	 	,	and	it	's	got	to	be	 believ 	 able 	 	.
the	 up 	 side 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	if	you	're	 tell 	 ing 	 	me	that	you	're	going	to	be	out	there	,	five	 year 	 s 	 	out	,	making	a	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	--	hmm	.	that	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	 up 	 side 	 	.
 tell 	 ing 	 	me	you	're	going	to	be	out	there	making	a	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	--	that	's	not	 believ 	 able 	 	.
so	it	's	got	to	be	both	 side 	 s 	 	.
on	the	other	hand	,	there	are	a	lot	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	drive	me	down	,	take	the	 emotion 	 al 	 	level	down	,	and	you	've	got	to	 re 	 cover 	 	from	 t 	 hose 	 	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	are	 any 	 thing 	 	you	tell	me	that	i	know	is	not	true	.
``	we	have	no	 com 	 petition 	 	.	there	's	 no 	 body 	 	else	who	's	ever	made	a	widget	like	 th 	 is 	 	.	``
 odd 	 s 	 	are	i	 prob 	 ably 	 	know	 some 	 body 	 	who	 ha 	 s 	 	made	a	widget	.
and	the	minute	you	tell	me	that	--	boom	!	you	know	,	i	 dis 	 count 	 	half	of	what	you	're	 say 	 ing 	 	from	then	on	.
 any 	 thing 	 	that	 make 	 s 	 	me	think	.	 any 	 thing 	 	that	i	do	n't	understand	,	where	i	have	to	make	the	leap	 my 	 self 	 	,	in	my	own	head	,	is	going	to	stop	the	flow	of	the	 present 	 ation 	 	.
so	,	you	've	got	to	take	me	through	like	a	sixth	 grad 	 er 	 	--	dub	,	dub	,	dub	,	dub	,	dub	--	but	 with 	 out 	 	 patron 	 izing 	 	me	.
and	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 trick 	 y 	 	path	to	do	it	.
but	if	you	can	do	it	,	it	 work 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	well	.
 any 	 thing 	 	that	's	 in 	 consist 	 ent 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	 con 	 cept 	 	of	your	thing	.
if	you	tell	me	 sale 	 s 	 	of	x	,	y	or	z	are	10	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	and	the	next	slide	,	or	five	 slide 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	they	're	five	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
well	,	one	may	have	 be 	 en 	 	gross	 sale 	 s 	 	,	one	may	have	 be 	 en 	 	net	 sale 	 s 	 	,	but	i	want	to	know	that	all	the	 number 	 s 	 	make	sense	together	.
and	then	 final 	 ly 	 	,	 any 	 thing 	 	that	's	an	error	,	or	a	typo	,	or	a	stupid	 mistak 	 e 	 	,	or	a	line	that	's	in	the	wrong	place	.	that	 show 	 s 	 	me	that	--	if	you	ca	n't	even	do	a	 present 	 ation 	 	,	how	the	heck	can	you	run	a	company	?
so	 th 	 is 	 	all	 feed 	 s 	 	in	together	.
all	right	,	so	the	best	way	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	is	to	look	at	our	 better 	 s 	 	,	look	at	people	who	have	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	before	.
so	let	's	look	at	the	most	 success 	 ful 	 	technology	 ex 	 ecutive 	 	in	the	business	and	see	how	a	 present 	 ation 	 	 go 	 es 	 	.
bill	 gate 	 s 	 	'	powerpoint	 present 	 ation 	 	over	here	.
here	's	 gate 	 s 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	a	thing	for	 window 	 s 	 	.
is	 th 	 is 	 	the	way	you	should	do	a	powerpoint	 present 	 ation 	 	?
what	do	you	think	?
no	.	who	do	you	think	we	should	look	at	 a 	 s 	 	our	role	model	?
oh	,	is	n't	that	funny	!	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	great	one	over	here	.
 y 	 es 	 	?	ok	,	steve	 job 	 s 	 	.
you	want	absolute	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	zen	of	 present 	 ation 	 	,	right	?
here	he	is	.	one	little	guy	,	black	 jean 	 s 	 	and	stuff	,	on	a	 total 	 ly 	 	empty	stage	.
what	are	you	 focus 	 ing 	 	on	?
you	're	 focus 	 ing 	 	on	him	!	 th 	 is 	 	is	steve	 job 	 s 	 	.
so	,	you	know	,	our	great	--	these	 wonder 	 ful 	 	long	bullet	 point 	 s 	 	,	a	whole	list	of	 thing 	 s 	 	,	you	know	--	good	!
no	,	they	're	not	.
the	long	bullet	 point 	 s 	 	are	bad	.

best	of	all	,	 image 	 s 	 	.	just	a	simple	image	.
i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	image	--	a	picture	's	worth	a	thousand	 word 	 s 	 	.
you	look	at	the	image	and	you	see	that	,	and	you	drop	the	whole	thing	.
and	then	,	you	come	back	to	me	.
and	you	're	focused	on	me	and	why	i	'm	 s 	 uch 	 	a	great	guy	,	and	why	you	want	to	invest	in	me	.

and	then	i	come	back	to	you	.	i	'm	focused	on	you	,	ok	?
you	do	that	,	you	give	me	your	quick	15	-	second	or	30	-	second	intro	,	grab	my	attention	.
and	then	you	want	to	give	me	a	quick	business	 over 	 view 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	five	-	minute	pitch	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	you	know	,	two	 sentence 	 s 	 	.
``	we	build	 widget 	 s 	 	for	the	x	,	y	,	z	market	.	``
or	,	``	we	sell	 service 	 s 	 	to	help	 some 	 body 	 	do	x.	``	you	know	,	 what 	 ever 	 	.
and	that	is	like	the	picture	on	the	 out 	 side 	 	of	a	 jig 	 saw 	 	 puzzl 	 e 	 	box	.

you	know	,	do	n't	do	a	live	demo	.
no	,	never	do	a	live	demo	.
do	a	 can 	 ned 	 	demo	,	or	do	 some 	 thing 	 	that	lets	me	know	why	people	are	going	to	buy	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	.
then	i	want	to	know	--	now	that	i	know	what	you	're	selling	,	tell	me	how	you	make	money	on	it	.
for	every	x	you	sell	,	you	get	y	,	you	do	your	 service 	 s 	 	of	z	.
i	want	to	know	what	the	business	model	is	on	a	sort	of	per	-	unit	 bas 	 is 	 	,	or	for	the	actual	product	that	you	're	selling	.
i	want	to	know	who	you	're	selling	 th 	 is 	 	thing	to	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 custom 	 ers 	 	.
and	i	want	to	know	if	you	have	any	 relationship 	 s 	 	that	are	going	to	be	special	to	help	you	.

 th 	 is 	 	 help 	 s 	 	to	say	you	're	 big 	 ger 	 	than	just	one	little	thing	over	here	.
but	then	,	 every 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 com 	 petition 	 	.
there	 ha 	 s 	 	never	 be 	 en 	 	a	company	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	 com 	 petition 	 	.
even	if	the	 com 	 petition 	 	is	the	old	way	of	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	.	i	want	to	know	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	your	 com 	 petition 	 	is	,	and	then	that	will	help	me	 judg 	 e 	 	how	you	fit	 in 	 to 	 	the	whole	operation	over	here	.
but	then	,	i	want	to	know	how	you	're	special	.
if	i	know	what	your	 com 	 petition 	 	 do 	 es 	 	,	how	are	you	going	to	prevent	your	 com 	 petition 	 	from	eating	your	lunch	over	here	?
and	then	all	 th 	 is 	 	ties	 in 	 to 	 	the	financial	 over 	 view 	 	.
and	you	have	to	have	--	you	ca	n't	do	a	vc	pitch	 with 	 out 	 	giving	me	your	 financial 	 s 	 	.
i	want	to	know	three	and	,	you	know	,	a	year	or	two	back	,	or	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	in	 exist 	 ence 	 	.
and	i	want	to	know	three	or	four	or	five	 year 	 s 	 	forward	.
five	is	a	bit	much	.	 prob 	 ably 	 	four	is	rational	.
and	i	want	to	know	how	that	business	model	that	you	 show 	 ed 	 	me	on	a	product	 bas 	 is 	 	is	going	to	 transl 	 ate 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	company	model	.
and	,	you	know	,	how	 man 	 y 	 	 widget 	 s 	 	are	you	going	to	sell	?
you	're	making	x	amount	per	widget	.
i	want	to	know	what	the	driver	is	.
we	're	going	to	have	1,000	 custom 	 ers 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	,	and	10,000	next	year	.
and	our	 revenue 	 s 	 	are	going	to	go	 th 	 is 	 	,	that	and	the	other	thing	.
and	so	that	 give 	 s 	 	me	the	whole	picture	for	the	next	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 year 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	which	i	'm	 invest 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	want	to	know	how	the	money	you	're	going	to	get	from	me	is	going	to	help	you	get	there	.
you	're	going	to	open	an	 off 	 shore 	 	plant	in	 chin 	 a 	 	,	you	're	going	to	 s 	 pend 	 	it	all	on	 sale 	 s 	 	and	 market 	 ing 	 	,	you	're	going	to	go	to	tahiti	,	or	 what 	 ever 	 	out	there	.
but	then	 come 	 s 	 	the	ask	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	where	you	tell	me	how	much	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	want	to	get	.
you	're	looking	for	5	million	--	at	what	kind	of	 valu 	 ation 	 	?
two	million	at	100,000	.
what	's	the	money	in	so	far	?	who	 invest 	 ed 	 	?
i	hope	you	 invest 	 ed 	 	 personal 	 ly 	 	.	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	 follow 	 ing 	 	on	.	if	you	ca	n't	invest	in	your	own	thing	,	why	should	i	invest	in	it	?
so	i	like	to	know	if	you	have	 friend 	 s 	 	and	family	,	or	angel	 invest 	 ors 	 	in	there	,	or	you	've	had	more	vcs	before	.
what	's	the	capital	structure	up	 un 	 til 	 	 th 	 is 	 	point	?
and	then	 final 	 ly 	 	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	all	that	,	you	've	now	told	me	the	whole	thing	,	so	now	you	've	got	to	 br 	 ing 	 	it	back	to	that	 con 	 clusion 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	that	rocket	going	up	.
so	 hope 	 fully 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	positive	,	positive	,	positive	,	more	positive	.
and	 every 	 thing 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	you	say	 click 	 s 	 	with	me	,	and	it	all	 make 	 s 	 	sense	.
and	i	'm	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	great	.	``
and	then	you	take	me	back	to	your	logo	.
just	your	logo	on	the	screen	.
and	i	look	at	the	logo	--	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	good	.
now	i	come	back	to	you	.	 noth 	 ing 	 	else	to	look	at	,	right	?
and	now	,	you	've	got	to	wrap	it	up	and	tie	it	up	here	.
you	've	got	to	give	me	the	final	,	you	know	--	boom	!	--
the	final	pitch	that	's	going	to	 s 	 end 	 	me	 in 	 to 	 	space	.
now	,	in	the	process	of	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	over	here	,	how	do	you	remember	the	 sequence 	 s 	 	and	 do 	 ers 	 	?
you	've	 notice 	 d 	 	here	that	i	'm	not	looking	at	the	screen	,	right	?
the	screen	is	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	is	set	up	so	it	's	in	front	of	me	.
so	,	i	could	n't	even	see	if	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	.
so	now	,	how	do	i	know	what	's	going	on	here	?
well	,	i	've	got	a	 lap 	 top 	 	in	front	of	me	,	but	you	're	looking	at	me	.	and	you	're	looking	at	 th 	 is 	 	.
what	do	you	think	i	'm	looking	at	?
you	think	that	i	'm	looking	at	that	?
no	,	i	'm	looking	 actual 	 ly 	 	at	a	special	version	of	powerpoint	over	here	,	which	 show 	 s 	 	me	the	 slide 	 s 	 	 a 	 head 	 	,	the	 slide 	 s 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	,	my	 note 	 s 	 	from	here	,	so	i	can	see	what	's	going	on	.
powerpoint	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	built	 in 	 to 	 	every	copy	of	powerpoint	that	's	 ship 	 ped 	 	.
if	you	use	apple	's	 key 	 note 	 	,	it	's	got	an	even	better	version	in	 key 	 note 	 	.
and	then	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	program	,	 call 	 ed 	 	 ov 	 ation 	 	,	you	can	get	from	adobe	,	that	they	just	 b 	 ought 	 	last	summer	.
which	 actual 	 ly 	 	 help 	 s 	 	you	run	the	whole	 timer 	 s 	 	,	and	it	lets	you	figure	out	what	's	going	on	.
so	,	here	's	my	wrap	up	to	take	you	to	the	moon	,	right	?
david	's	--	i	 usual 	 ly 	 	do	a	top	10	,	we	do	n't	have	time	for	top	10s	.
so	david	's	top	five	 present 	 ation 	 	 tip 	 s 	 	.
number	one	:	 al 	 ways 	 	use	 present 	 er 	 	mode	,	or	 ov 	 ation 	 	,	or	 present 	 er 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	lets	you	know	 exact 	 ly 	 	where	you	're	going	.
it	 help 	 s 	 	you	pace	 your 	 self 	 	,	it	 give 	 s 	 	you	a	timer	so	we	end	on	time	and	the	whole	bit	.
number	four	:	 al 	 ways 	 	use	remote	control	.
have	you	 s 	 een 	 	me	touch	the	computer	?
no	,	you	have	n't	.	why	not	?
 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	using	remote	control	over	here	.
 al 	 ways 	 	use	remote	control	.
number	three	:	the	 hand 	 out 	 s 	 	you	give	are	not	your	 present 	 ation 	 	.
if	you	follow	my	 suggest 	 ions 	 	,	you	're	going	to	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	spare	,	 ver 	 y 	 	zen	-	like	 present 	 ation 	 	,	which	is	great	for	 convey 	 ing 	 	who	you	are	and	 get 	 ting 	 	people	 emotion 	 ally 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	.
but	it	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	good	 a 	 s 	 	a	 hand 	 out 	 	.
you	want	to	have	a	 hand 	 out 	 	that	 give 	 s 	 	a	lot	more	information	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 hand 	 out 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	stand	 with 	 out 	 	you	over	here	.
number	three	:
do	n't	read	your	speech	.
can	you	imagine	?	``	well	,	you	should	invest	in	my	company	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	good	.	``
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	,	right	?	do	n't	read	your	speech	.
and	the	number	one	 present 	 ation 	 	tip	:	never	,	ever	look	at	the	screen	.
you	're	making	a	 connect 	 ion 	 	with	your	audience	over	here	,	and	you	 al 	 ways 	 	want	to	do	a	one	-	on	-	one	 connect 	 ion 	 	.
the	screen	should	come	up	 visual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	you	,	and	supplement	what	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	replace	you	.
and	that	is	how	to	pitch	to	a	vc	.
