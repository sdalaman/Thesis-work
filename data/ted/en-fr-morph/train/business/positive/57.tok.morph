i	'm	going	to	discuss	with	you	three	of	my	 invent 	 ions 	 	that	can	have	an	effect	on	10	to	a	100	million	people	,	which	we	will	hope	to	see	happen	.
we	 discuss 	 ed 	 	,	in	the	prior	film	,	some	of	the	old	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	did	,	like	 s 	 tent 	 s 	 	and	insulin	 pump 	 s 	 	for	the	diabetic	.
and	i	'd	like	to	talk	 ver 	 y 	 	 brief 	 ly 	 	about	three	new	 invent 	 ions 	 	that	will	change	the	 live 	 s 	 	of	 man 	 y 	 	people	.
at	the	present	time	,	it	 take 	 s 	 	an	average	of	three	 hour 	 s 	 	after	the	first	 symptom 	 s 	 	of	a	heart	attack	are	 recogn 	 ized 	 	by	the	patient	,	before	that	patient	 arriv 	 es 	 	at	an	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	room	.
and	people	with	silent	ischemia	--	which	,	 transl 	 ated 	 	 in 	 to 	 	english	,	 mean 	 s 	 	they	do	n't	have	any	 symptom 	 s 	 	--	it	 take 	 s 	 	even	 long 	 er 	 	for	them	to	get	to	the	hospital	.
the	ami	,	 a 	 cute 	 	 myo 	 car 	 dial 	 	 in 	 far 	 ction 	 	,	which	is	a	doctor	's	big	word	so	they	can	charge	you	more	money	--	--	 mean 	 s 	 	a	heart	attack	.	annual	incidence	:	1.2	million	americans	.
 mortal 	 ity 	 	:	300,000	people	 dy 	 ing 	 	each	year	.
about	half	of	them	,	600,000	,	have	permanent	damage	to	 the 	 ir 	 	heart	that	will	cause	them	to	have	 ver 	 y 	 	bad	 problem 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	on	.
thus	900,000	people	either	have	 di 	 ed 	 	or	have	significant	damage	to	 the 	 ir 	 	heart	muscle	.
 symptom 	 s 	 	are	often	 deni 	 ed 	 	by	the	patient	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	us	men	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	are	 ver 	 y 	 	brave	.	we	are	 ver 	 y 	 	brave	,
and	we	do	n't	want	to	admit	that	i	'm	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	hell	of	a	chest	pain	.
then	,	 approximate 	 ly 	 	25	percent	of	all	 patient 	 s 	 	never	have	any	 symptom 	 s 	 	.
what	are	we	going	to	do	about	them	?	how	can	we	 s 	 ave 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	?
it	's	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	true	of	 diabetic 	 s 	 	and	 elder 	 ly 	 	women	.
well	,	what	is	 need 	 ed 	 	for	the	 ear 	 liest 	 	possible	 war 	 ning 	 	of	a	heart	attack	?
a	 mean 	 s 	 	to	determine	if	there	's	a	complete	 block 	 age 	 	of	a	 cor 	 on 	 ary 	 	 art 	 ery 	 	.
that	,	 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	is	a	heart	attack	.
the	 mean 	 s 	 	consist	of	 not 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	a	little	technical	,	st	segment	 elev 	 ation 	 	of	the	 electro 	 gram 	 	--
 transl 	 ated 	 	 in 	 to 	 	english	,	that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	if	there	's	an	 electric 	 al 	 	signal	in	the	heart	,	and	one	part	of	the	ecg	--	which	we	call	the	st	segment	--	 elev 	 ates 	 	,	that	is	a	 s 	 ure 	 	sign	of	a	heart	attack	.
and	if	we	had	a	computer	put	 in 	 to 	 	the	body	of	a	person	who	's	at	risk	,	we	could	know	,	before	they	even	have	 symptom 	 s 	 	,	that	they	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	heart	attack	,	to	 s 	 ave 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	life	.
well	,	the	doctor	can	program	a	level	of	 th 	 is 	 	st	 elev 	 ation 	 	 volt 	 age 	 	that	will	trigger	an	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	alarm	,	vibration	like	your	cell	phone	,	but	right	by	your	clavicle	bone	.
and	when	it	 go 	 es 	 	beep	,	beep	,	beep	,	you	better	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	want	to	live	you	have	to	get	to	some	medical	 treat 	 ment 	 	.
so	we	have	to	try	these	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	out	 be 	 cause 	 	the	fda	wo	n't	just	let	us	use	them	on	people	 un 	 less 	 	we	try	it	out	first	,	and	the	best	model	for	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	to	be	 pig 	 s 	 	.
and	what	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	with	the	pig	was	external	 electro 	 de 	 s 	 	on	the	skin	,	like	you	see	in	an	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	room	,	and	i	'm	going	to	show	you	why	they	do	n't	work	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.
and	then	we	put	a	lead	,	which	is	a	wire	,	in	the	right	ventricle	 in 	 side 	 	the	heart	,	which	 do 	 es 	 	the	 electro 	 gram 	 	,	which	is	the	signal	 volt 	 age 	 	from	 in 	 side 	 	the	heart	.
well	,	with	the	pig	,	at	the	 base 	 line 	 	,	before	we	 block 	 ed 	 	the	pig	's	 art 	 ery 	 	to	 simul 	 ate 	 	a	heart	attack	,	that	was	the	signal	.
after	43	 second 	 s 	 	,	even	an	expert	could	n't	tell	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	,	and	after	three	 minute 	 s 	 	--	well	,	if	you	 re 	 ally 	 	 stud 	 ied 	 	it	,	you	'd	see	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
but	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	when	we	 look 	 ed 	 	 in 	 side 	 	the	pig	's	heart	,	to	the	 electro 	 gram 	 	?
there	was	the	 base 	 line 	 	--	first	of	all	,	a	much	 big 	 ger 	 	and	more	 reli 	 able 	 	signal	.
second	of	all	,	i	'll	bet	even	you	people	who	are	 un 	 trained 	 	can	see	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	,	and	we	see	here	an	st	segment	 elev 	 ation 	 	right	after	 th 	 is 	 	sharp	line	.	look	at	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	there	.	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	take	much	--	every	 lay 	 person 	 	could	see	that	 differ 	 ence 	 	,	and	 computer 	 s 	 	can	be	 programm 	 ed 	 	to	 eas 	 ily 	 	detect	it	.
then	,	look	at	that	after	three	 minute 	 s 	 	.
we	see	that	the	signal	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	in	the	heart	,	we	can	use	it	to	tell	people	that	they	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	heart	attack	even	before	they	have	 symptom 	 s 	 	so	we	can	 s 	 ave 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	life	.
then	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	it	with	my	son	,	dr.	tim	fischell	,	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	it	on	some	human	 patient 	 s 	 	who	had	to	have	a	 s 	 tent 	 	put	in	.
well	,	he	 ke 	 pt 	 	the	balloon	 fill 	 ed 	 	to	block	the	 art 	 ery 	 	,	to	 simul 	 ate 	 	a	 block 	 age 	 	,	which	is	what	a	heart	attack	is	.
and	it	's	not	hard	to	see	that	--	the	 base 	 line 	 	is	the	first	picture	on	the	upper	left	.
next	to	it	,	at	30	 second 	 s 	 	,	you	see	 th 	 is 	 	rise	here	,	then	 th 	 is 	 	rise	--	that	's	the	st	 elev 	 ation 	 	.
and	if	we	had	a	computer	that	could	detect	it	,	we	could	tell	you	you	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	heart	attack	so	early	it	could	 s 	 ave 	 	your	life	and	prevent	 con 	 gest 	 ive 	 	heart	failure	.
and	then	he	did	it	 aga 	 in 	 	.	we	 fill 	 ed 	 	the	balloon	 aga 	 in 	 	a	few	 minute 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	and	here	you	see	,	even	after	10	 second 	 s 	 	,	a	great	rise	in	 th 	 is 	 	piece	,	which	we	can	have	 computer 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	,	under	your	chest	like	a	 pace 	 maker 	 	,	with	a	wire	 in 	 to 	 	your	heart	like	a	 pace 	 maker 	 	.
and	 computer 	 s 	 	do	n't	go	to	sleep	.
we	have	a	little	 batt 	 ery 	 	and	on	 th 	 is 	 	little	 batt 	 ery 	 	that	computer	will	run	for	five	 year 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 need 	 ing 	 	 re 	 placement 	 	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	the	system	look	like	?
well	,	on	the	left	is	the	imd	,	which	is	 implant 	 able 	 	medical	 de 	 vice 	 	,	and	 to 	 night 	 	in	the	tent	you	can	see	it	--	they	've	 exhibit 	 ed 	 	it	.
it	's	about	 th 	 is 	 	big	,	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	 pace 	 maker 	 	.
it	's	 implant 	 ed 	 	with	 ver 	 y 	 	 convention 	 al 	 	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	.
and	the	exd	is	an	external	 de 	 vice 	 	that	you	can	have	on	your	night	table	.
it	'll	wake	you	up	and	tell	you	to	get	your	tail	to	the	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	room	when	the	thing	 go 	 es 	 	off	 be 	 cause 	 	,	if	you	do	n't	,	you	're	in	deep	doo	-	doo	.
and	then	,	 final 	 ly 	 	,	a	 programm 	 er 	 	that	will	set	the	level	of	the	 stimul 	 ation 	 	,	which	is	the	level	which	 say 	 s 	 	you	are	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	heart	attack	.
the	fda	 say 	 s 	 	,	ok	,	test	 th 	 is 	 	final	 de 	 vice 	 	after	it	's	built	in	some	animal	,	which	we	 s 	 aid 	 	is	a	pig	,	so	we	had	to	get	 th 	 is 	 	pig	to	have	a	heart	attack	.
and	when	you	go	to	the	 farm 	 yard 	 	,	you	ca	n't	 eas 	 ily 	 	get	 pig 	 s 	 	to	have	heart	 attack 	 s 	 	,	so	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	well	,	we	're	 expert 	 s 	 	in	 s 	 tent 	 s 	 	.
 to 	 night 	 	you	'll	see	some	of	our	 invent 	 ed 	 	 s 	 tent 	 s 	 	.
we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	so	we	'll	put	in	a	 s 	 tent 	 	,	but	we	're	not	going	to	put	in	a	 s 	 tent 	 	that	we	'd	put	in	people	.
we	're	 put 	 ting 	 	in	a	 cop 	 per 	 	 s 	 tent 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 cop 	 per 	 	 s 	 tent 	 	 erode 	 s 	 	the	 art 	 ery 	 	and	 cause 	 s 	 	heart	 attack 	 s 	 	.
that	's	not	 ver 	 y 	 	nice	,	but	,	after	all	,	we	had	to	find	out	what	the	answer	is	.
so	we	took	two	 cop 	 per 	 	 s 	 tent 	 s 	 	and	we	put	it	in	the	 art 	 ery 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	pig	,	and	let	me	show	you	the	result	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 grat 	 ifying 	 	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	people	who	have	heart	disease	are	 concern 	 ed 	 	.
so	there	it	was	,	thursday	 morn 	 ing 	 	we	 stop 	 ped 	 	the	pig	's	 medic 	 ation 	 	and	there	is	his	 electro 	 gram 	 	,	the	signal	from	 in 	 side 	 	the	pig	's	heart	coming	out	by	radio	 tele 	 metry 	 	.
then	,	on	friday	at	6:43	,	he	 beg 	 an 	 	to	get	certain	 sign 	 s 	 	,	which	 lat 	 er 	 	we	had	the	pig	run	around	--	i	'm	not	going	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	early	stage	.
but	look	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	at	10:06	after	we	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	pig	's	 medic 	 ation 	 	that	 ke 	 pt 	 	him	from	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	heart	attack	.
any	one	of	you	now	is	an	expert	on	st	 elev 	 ation 	 	.	can	you	see	it	there	?
can	you	see	it	in	the	picture	after	the	big	rise	of	the	qrs	--	you	see	st	 elev 	 ation 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	pig	at	10:06	was	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	heart	attack	.
what	 happen 	 s 	 	after	you	have	the	heart	attack	,	 th 	 is 	 	 block 	 age 	 	?
your	rhythm	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 ir 	 regular 	 	,	and	that	's	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	45	 minute 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
then	,	 vent 	 r 	 icular 	 	 fi 	 brill 	 ation 	 	,	the	heart	 qui 	 ver 	 s 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 beat 	 s 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	before	death	of	the	pig	--	and	then	the	pig	 di 	 ed 	 	;	it	went	flat	-	line	.
but	we	had	a	little	bit	over	an	hour	where	we	could	've	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	pig	's	life	.
well	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	fda	,	we	did	n't	 s 	 ave 	 	the	pig	's	life	,
 be 	 cause 	 	we	need	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	type	of	animal	research	for	 human 	 s 	 	.
but	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	the	sake	of	a	human	,	we	can	 s 	 ave 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	life	.
we	can	 s 	 ave 	 	the	 live 	 s 	 	of	people	who	are	at	high	risk	for	a	heart	attack	.
what	is	the	 respons 	 e 	 	to	 a 	 cute 	 	 myo 	 car 	 dial 	 	 in 	 far 	 ction 	 	,	a	heart	attack	,	 to 	 day 	 	?
well	,	you	feel	some	chest	pain	or	 in 	 digest 	 ion 	 	.
it	's	not	all	that	bad	;	you	decide	not	to	do	 any 	 thing 	 	.
 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 hour 	 s 	 	pass	and	it	 get 	 s 	 	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	and	even	the	man	wo	n't	 ignor 	 e 	 	it	.
 final 	 ly 	 	,	you	go	to	the	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	room	.
you	wait	 a 	 s 	 	 burn 	 s 	 	and	other	critical	 patient 	 s 	 	are	 treat 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	75	percent	of	the	 patient 	 s 	 	who	go	to	an	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	room	with	chest	 pain 	 s 	 	do	n't	have	ami	,	so	you	're	not	taken	 ver 	 y 	 	 serious 	 ly 	 	.
they	 final 	 ly 	 	see	you	.	it	 take 	 s 	 	more	time	to	get	your	 electro 	 cardio 	 gram 	 	on	your	skin	and	 diagnos 	 e 	 	it	,	and	it	's	hard	to	do	 be 	 cause 	 	they	do	n't	have	the	 base 	 line 	 	data	,	which	the	computer	we	put	in	you	 get 	 s 	 	.
 final 	 ly 	 	,	if	you	're	 luck 	 y 	 	,	you	are	 treat 	 ed 	 	in	three	or	four	 hour 	 s 	 	after	the	incident	,	but	the	heart	muscle	 ha 	 s 	 	 di 	 ed 	 	.
and	that	is	the	typical	 treat 	 ment 	 	in	the	 advance 	 d 	 	world	--	not	africa	--	that	's	the	typical	 treat 	 ment 	 	in	the	 advance 	 d 	 	world	 to 	 day 	 	.
so	we	 develop 	 ed 	 	the	angelmed	 guard 	 ian 	 	system
and	we	have	a	 de 	 vice 	 	 in 	 side 	 	 th 	 is 	 	patient	,	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 implant 	 ed 	 	angelmed	 guard 	 ian 	 	.
and	when	you	have	a	 block 	 age 	 	,	the	alarm	 go 	 es 	 	off	and	it	 s 	 end 	 s 	 	the	alarm	and	the	 electro 	 gram 	 	to	an	external	 de 	 vice 	 	,	which	 get 	 s 	 	your	 base 	 line 	 	 electro 	 gram 	 	from	24	 hour 	 s 	 	ago
and	the	one	that	 caus 	 ed 	 	the	alarm	,	so	you	can	take	it	to	the	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	room	and	show	them	,	and	say	,	take	care	of	me	right	away	.
then	it	 go 	 es 	 	to	a	network	 operation 	 s 	 	center	,	where	they	get	your	data	from	your	patient	 data 	 base 	 	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	put	in	at	some	central	location	,	say	,	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
then	it	 go 	 es 	 	to	a	 diagnos 	 tic 	 	center	,	and	 with 	 in 	 	one	minute	of	your	heart	attack	,	your	signal	 appear 	 s 	 	on	the	screen	of	a	computer	and	the	computer	 analyz 	 es 	 	what	your	problem	is	.
and	the	person	who	's	there	,	the	medical	practitioner	,	 call 	 s 	 	you	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	a	cell	phone	--	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	mr.	smith	,	you	're	in	deep	doo	-	doo	;	you	have	a	problem	.
we	've	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 ambul 	 ance 	 	.	the	 ambul 	 ance 	 	is	on	the	way	.
it	'll	pick	you	up	,	and	then	we	're	going	to	call	your	doctor	,	tell	him	about	it	.
we	're	going	to	 s 	 end 	 	him	the	signal	that	we	have	,	that	 say 	 s 	 	you	have	a	heart	attack	,	and	we	're	going	to	 s 	 end 	 	the	signal	to	the	hospital	and	we	're	going	to	have	it	 analyz 	 ed 	 	there	,	and	there	you	're	going	to	be	with	your	doctor	and	you	'll	be	taken	care	of	so	you	wo	n't	die	of	a	heart	attack	.	``
that	's	the	first	 invent 	 ion 	 	that	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	.
and	now	i	want	to	talk	about	 some 	 thing 	 	 entire 	 ly 	 	different	.
at	first	i	did	n't	think	migraine	 head 	 ache 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	a	big	problem
 be 	 cause 	 	i	'd	never	had	a	migraine	 head 	 ache 	 	,
but	then	i	spoke	to	some	people	who	have	three	or	four	every	week	of	 the 	 ir 	 	life	,	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 total 	 ly 	 	 ruin 	 ed 	 	by	it	.
we	have	a	mission	 state 	 ment 	 	for	our	company	 do 	 ing 	 	migraine	,	which	is	,	``	prevent	or	 amelio 	 rate 	 	migraine	 head 	 ache 	 s 	 	by	the	application	of	a	safe	,	controlled	 magnet 	 ic 	 	 puls 	 e 	 	 appli 	 ed 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	,	by	the	patient	.	``
now	,	you	're	 prob 	 ably 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	few	 physicist 	 s 	 	here	.
if	you	're	a	physicist	you	'd	know	there	's	a	certain	faraday	's	law	,	which	 say 	 s 	 	if	i	 app 	 ly 	 	a	 magnet 	 ic 	 	 puls 	 e 	 	on	salt	water	--	that	's	your	 brain 	 s 	 	by	the	way	--	it	'll	generate	electric	 current 	 s 	 	,	and	the	electric	current	in	the	brain	can	 er 	 ase 	 	a	migraine	 head 	 ache 	 	.
that	's	what	we	have	 discover 	 ed 	 	.
so	here	's	a	picture	of	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	.
the	 patient 	 s 	 	who	have	a	migraine	 precede 	 d 	 	by	an	aura	have	a	band	of	 excit 	 ed 	 	 neuro 	 ns 	 	--	that	's	 show 	 n 	 	in	red	--	that	 move 	 s 	 	at	three	to	five	 millimeter 	 s 	 	a	minute	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	mid	-	brain	.
and	when	it	 hit 	 s 	 	the	mid	-	brain	,	that	's	when	the	 head 	 ache 	 	 begin 	 s 	 	.
there	's	 th 	 is 	 	migraine	that	is	 precede 	 d 	 	by	a	visual	aura	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	visual	aura	,	by	the	way	--	and	i	'll	show	you	a	picture	--	but	it	sort	of	 begin 	 s 	 	with	little	 danc 	 ing 	 	 light 	 s 	 	,	 get 	 s 	 	 big 	 ger 	 	and	 big 	 ger 	 	 un 	 til 	 	it	 fill 	 s 	 	your	whole	visual	field	.
and	what	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	was	 th 	 is 	 	;	here	is	a	 de 	 vice 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	cadwell	model	mes	10	.
 weigh 	 s 	 	about	70	 pound 	 s 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	a	wire	about	an	inch	in	 dia 	 meter 	 	.
and	here	's	one	of	the	 patient 	 s 	 	who	 ha 	 s 	 	an	aura	and	 al 	 ways 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 head 	 ache 	 	,	bad	one	,	after	the	aura	.	what	do	we	do	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	an	aura	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
it	's	sort	of	funny	 danc 	 ing 	 	 light 	 s 	 	,	 show 	 n 	 	there	on	the	left	and	right	side	.
and	that	's	a	fully	 develop 	 ed 	 	visual	aura	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	see	on	top	.
in	the	middle	,	our	 experiment 	 alist 	 	,	the	 neuro 	 logist 	 	,	who	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'm	going	to	move	 th 	 is 	 	down	a	little	and	i	'm	going	to	 er 	 ase 	 	half	your	aura	.	``
and	,	by	god	,	the	 neuro 	 logist 	 	did	 er 	 ase 	 	it	,	and	that	's	the	middle	picture	:	half	of	the	aura	 era 	 s 	 ed 	 	by	a	short	 magnet 	 ic 	 	 puls 	 e 	 	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	?
that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	the	 magnet 	 ic 	 	 puls 	 e 	 	is	generating	an	electric	current	that	's	 inter 	 fer 	 ing 	 	with	the	 er 	 ron 	 eous 	 	 electric 	 al 	 	activity	in	the	brain	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	ok	,	now	i	'm	going	to	--	``	all	of	the	aura	get	 era 	 s 	 ed 	 	with	an	 appropriate 	 ly 	 	 place 	 d 	 	 magnet 	 ic 	 	 puls 	 e 	 	.
what	is	the	result	?	we	designed	a	 magnet 	 ic 	 	 de 	 polar 	 izer 	 	that	 look 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	that	you	could	have	--	a	 lad 	 y 	 	,	in	her	pocket	book	--	and	when	you	get	an	aura	you	can	try	it	and	see	how	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
well	,	the	next	thing	they	have	to	show	is	what	was	on	abc	news	,	channel	7	,	last	week	in	new	york	city	,	in	the	11	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	news	.

stacy	sager	:	but	for	christina	sidebottom	,	 al 	 most 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	was	worth	 try 	 ing 	 	if	it	could	stop	a	migraine	.
it	may	look	 s 	 il 	 ly 	 	or	even	 frighten 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	walk	around	with	it	in	your	 pur 	 s 	 e 	 	,	but	 research 	 ers 	 	here	in	ohio	 organ 	 izing 	 	 clinic 	 al 	 	 trial 	 s 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	migraine	 zap 	 per 	 	,	say	it	is	 scientific 	 ally 	 	sound	--

robert	fischell	:	and	that	is	the	 invent 	 ion 	 	to	treat	 migraine 	 s 	 	.
you	see	,	the	problem	is	,	30	million	americans	have	migraine	 head 	 ache 	 s 	 	,	and	we	need	a	 mean 	 s 	 	to	treat	it	,	and	i	think	that	we	now	have	it	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	 de 	 vice 	 	that	we	did	,	and	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	my	second	wish	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	to	do	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
our	 con 	 clusion 	 s 	 	from	our	 stud 	 ies 	 	so	far	,	at	three	research	 center 	 s 	 	,	is	there	is	a	 mark 	 ed 	 	 improve 	 ment 	 	in	pain	 level 	 s 	 	after	using	it	just	once	.
the	most	severe	 head 	 ache 	 s 	 	 respond 	 ed 	 	better	after	we	did	it	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 time 	 s 	 	,
and	the	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	 find 	 ing 	 	 indic 	 ates 	 	that	even	 establish 	 ed 	 	 head 	 ache 	 s 	 	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	with	aura	,	get	 treat 	 ed 	 	and	get	 diminish 	 ed 	 	.
and	 aura 	 s 	 	can	be	 era 	 s 	 ed 	 	and	the	migraine	,	then	,	 do 	 es 	 	not	occur	.
and	that	is	the	migraine	 invent 	 ion 	 	that	we	are	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	and	that	we	are	 work 	 ing 	 	on	.
the	third	and	last	 invent 	 ion 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	with	an	idea	.
epilepsy	can	best	be	 treat 	 ed 	 	by	 respons 	 ive 	 	 electric 	 al 	 	 stimul 	 ation 	 	.
now	,	why	do	we	use	--	add	on	,	 near 	 ly 	 	,	an	epileptic	focus	?
now	,	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	us	technical	people	,	 un 	 like 	 	mr.	bono	,	have	to	get	 in 	 to 	 	all	these	technical	 word 	 s 	 	.
well	,	``	 respons 	 ive 	 	 electric 	 al 	 	 stimul 	 ation 	 	``	 mean 	 s 	 	that	we	sense	,	at	a	place	in	your	brain	which	is	 call 	 ed 	 	an	``	epileptic	focus	,	``	which	is	where	the	epileptic	seizure	 begin 	 s 	 	--
we	sense	there	,	that	it	's	going	to	happen	,	and	then	we	respond	by	 app 	 ly 	 ing 	 	an	 electric 	 al 	 	energy	at	that	spot	,	which	 er 	 ase 	 s 	 	the	 er 	 rant 	 	signal	so	that	you	do	n't	get	the	 clinic 	 al 	 	 manifest 	 ations 	 	of	the	migraine	 head 	 ache 	 	.
we	use	current	 pace 	 maker 	 	 defi 	 brill 	 ator 	 	technology	that	's	used	for	the	heart	.
we	thought	we	could	adapt	it	for	the	brain	.
the	 de 	 vice 	 	could	be	 implant 	 ed 	 	under	the	scalp	to	be	 total 	 ly 	 	 hid 	 den 	 	and	avoid	wire	 break 	 age 	 	,	which	 occur 	 s 	 	if	you	put	it	in	the	chest	and	you	try	to	move	your	neck	around	.
form	a	company	to	develop	a	neuro	-	 pace 	 maker 	 	for	epilepsy	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	other	 disease 	 s 	 	of	the	brain	,	 be 	 cause 	 	all	 disease 	 s 	 	of	the	brain	are	a	result	of	some	 electric 	 al 	 	 mal 	 function 	 	in	it	,	that	 cause 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	,	if	not	all	,	of	brain	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	.
we	 form 	 ed 	 	a	company	 call 	 ed 	 	neuropace	and	we	 start 	 ed 	 	work	on	 respons 	 ive 	 	 neuro 	 stimul 	 ation 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	of	what	the	 de 	 vice 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	like	,	that	's	 place 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	cranial	bone	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	a	better	picture	.
here	we	have	our	 de 	 vice 	 	in	which	we	put	in	a	frame	.
there	's	a	cut	made	in	the	scalp	;	it	's	 open 	 ed 	 	;	the	 neuro 	 surgeon 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	template	;	he	 mark 	 s 	 	it	around	,	and	uses	a	 dent 	 al 	 	burr	to	 re 	 move 	 	a	piece	of	the	cranial	bone	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	our	 de 	 vice 	 	.
and	 to 	 night 	 	,	you	'll	be	able	to	see	the	 de 	 vice 	 	in	the	tent	.
and	then	with	four	 screw 	 s 	 	,	we	put	in	a	frame	,	then	we	snap	in	the	 de 	 vice 	 	and	we	run	with	 wire 	 s 	 	--	the	one	 show 	 n 	 	in	green	will	go	to	the	surface	of	the	brain	with	 electro 	 de 	 s 	 	,	to	the	epileptic	focus	,	the	origin	of	the	epilepsy	,	where	we	can	sense	the	 electric 	 al 	 	signal	and	have	computer	analysis	that	 tell 	 s 	 	us	when	to	hit	it	with	some	 electric 	 al 	 	current	to	prevent	the	 clinic 	 al 	 	 manifest 	 ation 	 	of	the	seizure	.
in	the	blue	wire	,	we	see	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	a	deep	brain	 electro 	 de 	 	.
if	that	's	the	source	of	the	epilepsy	,	we	can	attack	that	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
the	 comprehens 	 ive 	 	solution	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 de 	 vice 	 	;	it	's	about	one	 inch 	 es 	 	by	two	 inch 	 es 	 	and	,	 odd 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	just	the	 thick 	 ness 	 	of	most	cranial	 bone 	 s 	 	.
the	 advantage 	 s 	 	of	 respons 	 ive 	 	 neuro 	 stimul 	 ation 	 	:	it	can	detect	and	terminate	 seizure 	 s 	 	before	the	 clinic 	 al 	 	 symptom 	 s 	 	occur	,	provide	 stimul 	 ation 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	when	 need 	 ed 	 	,	can	be	 turn 	 ed 	 	off	if	 seizure 	 s 	 	disappear	;	it	 ha 	 s 	 	minimal	side	 effect 	 s 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	a	matter	of	fact	,	in	all	our	 clinic 	 al 	 	 trial 	 s 	 	to	date	,	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	no	side	 effect 	 s 	 	in	the	40	or	so	 patient 	 s 	 	in	whom	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 implant 	 ed 	 	--	and	it	's	 in 	 visible 	 	,	 cosmetic 	 ally 	 	 hid 	 den 	 	,	so	,	if	you	have	epilepsy	and	you	have	the	 de 	 vice 	 	,	no	one	will	know	it	 be 	 cause 	 	you	ca	n't	tell	that	it	's	there	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 show 	 s 	 	what	an	 electro 	 encephalo 	 gram 	 	is	,	and	on	the	left	is	the	signal	of	a	 spontane 	 ous 	 	seizure	of	one	of	the	 patient 	 s 	 	.
then	we	 stimul 	 ated 	 	,	and	you	see	how	that	heavy	black	line	and	then	you	see	the	 electro 	 encephalo 	 gram 	 	signal	going	to	normal	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	they	did	not	get	the	epileptic	seizure	.
that	 conclude 	 s 	 	my	 discuss 	 ion 	 	of	epilepsy	,	which	is	the	third	 invent 	 ion 	 	that	i	want	to	discuss	here	 th 	 is 	 	afternoon	.
i	have	three	 wish 	 es 	 	.	well	,	i	ca	n't	do	much	about	africa	.
i	'm	a	tech	;	i	'm	 in 	 to 	 	medical	 gadget 	 ry 	 	,	which	is	 most 	 ly 	 	high	-	tech	stuff	like	mr.	bono	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	.
the	first	wish	is	to	use	the	epilepsy	 respons 	 ive 	 	 neuro 	 stimul 	 ator 	 	,	 call 	 ed 	 	rns	,	for	 respons 	 ive 	 	 neuro 	 stimul 	 ator 	 	--	that	's	a	 brilli 	 ant 	 	acronym	--	for	the	 treat 	 ment 	 	of	other	brain	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	.
well	,	if	we	're	going	to	do	it	for	epilepsy	,	why	the	hell	not	try	it	for	 some 	 thing 	 	else	?
then	you	saw	what	that	 de 	 vice 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	like	,	that	the	woman	was	using	to	fix	her	 migraine 	 s 	 	?
i	tell	you	 th 	 is 	 	:	that	's	 some 	 thing 	 	which	some	research	engineer	like	me	would	concoct	,	not	a	real	 design 	 er 	 	of	good	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	.
we	want	to	have	some	people	,	who	 re 	 ally 	 	know	how	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	perform	human	 engineer 	 ing 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	to	develop	the	 optim 	 um 	 	design	for	the	 port 	 able 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	for	 treat 	 ing 	 	migraine	 head 	 ache 	 s 	 	.
and	some	of	the	 sponsor 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	ted	 meet 	 ing 	 	are	 s 	 uch 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	.
then	we	're	going	to	 challeng 	 e 	 	the	ted	 attend 	 ees 	 	to	come	up	with	a	way	to	improve	health	care	in	the	usa	,	where	we	have	 problem 	 s 	 	that	africa	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	.
and	by	 reduc 	 ing 	 	 mal 	 practice 	 	 litig 	 ation 	 	--	 mal 	 practice 	 	 litig 	 ation 	 	is	not	an	african	problem	;	it	's	an	american	problem	.
so	,	to	get	 quick 	 ly 	 	to	my	first	wish	--	the	brain	 oper 	 ates 	 	by	 electric 	 al 	 	 signal 	 s 	 	.
if	the	 electric 	 al 	 	 signal 	 s 	 	create	a	brain	 dis 	 order 	 	,	electro	-	 stimul 	 ation 	 	can	 over 	 come 	 	that	 dis 	 order 	 	by	 act 	 ing 	 	on	the	brain	's	 neuro 	 ns 	 	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	if	you	've	 screw 	 ed 	 	up	 electric 	 al 	 	 signal 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	,	by	 put 	 ting 	 	other	 electric 	 al 	 	 signal 	 s 	 	from	a	computer	in	the	brain	,	we	can	 counter 	 act 	 	that	.
a	signal	in	the	brain	that	 trigger 	 s 	 	brain	 dy 	 s 	 function 	 	might	be	 sens 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	trigger	for	electro	-	 stimul 	 ation 	 	like	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	with	epilepsy	.
but	even	if	there	is	no	signal	,	electro	-	 stimul 	 ation 	 	of	an	appropriate	part	of	the	brain	can	turn	off	a	brain	 dis 	 order 	 	.
and	consider	 treat 	 ing 	 	 psycho 	 tic 	 	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	--	and	i	want	 th 	 is 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	with	the	ted	group	--	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 obsess 	 ive 	 	-	compulsive	 dis 	 order 	 	that	,	 present 	 ly 	 	,	is	not	well	 treat 	 ed 	 	with	 drug 	 s 	 	,	and	 include 	 s 	 	five	million	americans	.
and	mr.	fischer	,	and	his	group	at	neuropace	,	and	 my 	 self 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	we	can	have	a	 dramat 	 ic 	 	effect	in	 improv 	 ing 	 	ocd	in	america	and	in	the	world	.
that	is	the	first	wish	.
the	second	wish	is	,	at	the	present	time	,	the	 clinic 	 al 	 	 trial 	 s 	 	of	 trans 	 cranial 	 	 magnet 	 ic 	 	 stimul 	 ators 	 	--	that	's	what	tms	 mean 	 s 	 	,	 de 	 vice 	 	to	treat	migraine	 head 	 ache 	 s 	 	--	 appear 	 s 	 	to	be	 quit 	 e 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	.
well	,	that	's	the	good	news	.
the	present	 port 	 able 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	is	far	from	 optimal 	 ly 	 	designed	,	both	 a 	 s 	 	to	human	 factor 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 appear 	 ance 	 	.
i	think	she	 s 	 aid 	 	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	gun	.	a	lot	of	people	do	n't	like	 gun 	 s 	 	.
engage	a	company	 hav 	 ing 	 	prior	 success 	 es 	 	for	human	 factor 	 s 	 	 engineer 	 ing 	 	and	industrial	design	to	optimize	the	design	of	the	first	 port 	 able 	 	tms	 de 	 vice 	 	that	will	be	 s 	 old 	 	to	the	 patient 	 s 	 	who	have	migraine	 head 	 ache 	 s 	 	.
and	that	is	the	second	wish	.
and	,	of	the	100,000	-	dollar	prize	money	,	that	ted	was	so	 gen 	 er 	 ous 	 	to	give	me	,	i	am	 don 	 ating 	 	50,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	the	neuropace	people	to	get	on	with	the	 treat 	 ment 	 	of	ocd	,	 obsess 	 ive 	 	-	compulsive	 dis 	 order 	 	,	and	i	'm	making	 an 	 other 	 	50,000	 avail 	 able 	 	for	a	company	to	optimize	the	design	of	the	 de 	 vice 	 	for	 migraine 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	how	i	'll	use	my	100,000	-	dollar	prize	money	.
well	,	the	third	and	final	wish	is	 some 	 what 	 	--	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	much	more	 complic 	 ated 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 involve 	 s 	 	 lawyer 	 s 	 	.
well	,	medical	 mal 	 practice 	 	 litig 	 ation 	 	in	the	us	 ha 	 s 	 	 escal 	 ated 	 	the	cost	of	 mal 	 practice 	 	 insur 	 ance 	 	,	so	that	 compete 	 nt 	 	 physician 	 s 	 	are	 leav 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	practice	.
 lawyer 	 s 	 	take	 case 	 s 	 	on	 con 	 ting 	 ency 	 	with	the	hope	of	a	big	share	of	a	big	 settle 	 ment 	 	by	a	 sym 	 pathetic 	 	jury	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	patient	 re 	 ally 	 	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 bad 	 ly 	 	.
the	high	cost	of	health	care	in	the	us	is	 part 	 ly 	 	due	to	 litig 	 ation 	 	and	 insur 	 ance 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	.
i	've	 s 	 een 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	,	 graph 	 s 	 	in	 to 	 day 	 	's	usa	 to 	 day 	 	 show 	 ing 	 	it	 skyrocket 	 ing 	 	out	of	control	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	factor	.
well	,	how	can	the	ted	community	help	with	 th 	 is 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	?
i	have	a	couple	of	 idea 	 s 	 	to	begin	with	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	 start 	 ing 	 	point	for	 discuss 	 ion 	 	with	the	ted	group	,	a	major	part	of	the	problem	is	the	nature	of	the	written	 ex 	 tent 	 	of	 inform 	 ed 	 	consent	that	the	patient	or	spouse	must	read	and	sign	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	epilepsy	people	what	are	they	using	for	 inform 	 ed 	 	consent	.
would	you	 believ 	 e 	 	,	12	 page 	 s 	 	,	single	space	,	the	patient	 ha 	 s 	 	to	read	before	they	're	in	our	trial	to	cure	 the 	 ir 	 	epilepsy	?
what	do	you	think	 some 	 one 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	at	the	end	of	 read 	 ing 	 	12	single	-	 space 	 d 	 	 page 	 s 	 	?
they	do	n't	understand	what	the	hell	it	's	about	.
that	's	the	present	system	.	how	about	making	a	video	?
we	have	 entertain 	 ment 	 	people	here	;	we	have	people	who	know	how	to	do	 video 	 s 	 	,	with	visual	 present 	 ation 	 	of	the	anatomy	and	procedure	 d 	 one 	 	with	 anim 	 ation 	 	.
 every 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	that	we	can	do	better	with	a	visual	thing	that	can	be	 inter 	 active 	 	with	the	patient	,	where	they	see	the	video	and	they	're	 be 	 ing 	 	 video 	 ed 	 	and	they	press	,	do	you	understand	 th 	 is 	 	?	no	,	i	do	n't	.
well	,	then	let	's	go	to	a	 simpl 	 er 	 	 explan 	 ation 	 	.
then	there	's	a	 simpl 	 er 	 	one	and	,	oh	 y 	 es 	 	,	i	understand	that	.	well	,	press	the	button	and	you	're	on	record	,	you	understand	.
and	that	is	one	of	the	 idea 	 s 	 	.
now	,	 al 	 so 	 	a	video	is	 d 	 one 	 	of	the	patient	or	spouse	and	medical	 present 	 er 	 	,	with	the	patient	 agree 	 ing 	 	that	he	 understand 	 s 	 	the	procedure	to	be	 d 	 one 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	all	the	possible	failure	 mode 	 s 	 	.
the	patient	or	spouse	 agree 	 s 	 	not	to	file	a	 law 	 suit 	 	if	one	of	the	known	procedure	 failure 	 s 	 	 occur 	 s 	 	.
now	,	in	america	,	in	fact	,	you	can	not	give	up	your	right	to	trial	by	jury	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	if	a	video	is	there	that	 every 	 thing 	 	was	 explain 	 ed 	 	to	you	,	and	you	have	it	all	in	the	video	file	,	it	'll	be	much	less	 like 	 ly 	 	that	some	 hot 	 shot 	 	lawyer	will	take	 th 	 is 	 	case	on	 con 	 ting 	 ency 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	wo	n't	be	 near 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	good	a	case	.
if	a	medical	error	 occur 	 s 	 	,	the	patient	or	spouse	 agree 	 s 	 	to	a	 settle 	 ment 	 	for	fair	 compens 	 ation 	 	by	 arbitr 	 ation 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	going	to	court	.
that	would	 s 	 ave 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	legal	 cost 	 s 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 
and	would	 de 	 crease 	 	the	cost	of	medicine	for	 every 	 one 	 	.
these	are	just	some	 start 	 ing 	 	 point 	 s 	 	.
and	,	so	there	,	that	's	the	end	of	all	my	 wish 	 es 	 	.
i	wish	i	had	more	 wish 	 es 	 	but	three	is	what	i	've	got	and	there	they	are	.
