so	 to 	 day 	 	i	'm	going	to	talk	to	you	about	the	rise	of	 collabor 	 ative 	 	consumption	.
i	'm	going	to	explain	what	it	is	and	try	and	 con 	 vince 	 	you	--	in	just	15	 minute 	 s 	 	--	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	a	flimsy	idea	,	or	a	short	-	term	trend	,	but	a	 power 	 ful 	 	cultural	and	economic	force	 re 	 invent 	 ing 	 	not	just	what	we	 consum 	 e 	 	,	but	how	we	 consum 	 e 	 	.
now	i	'm	going	to	start	with	a	 deceptive 	 ly 	 	simple	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
 hand 	 s 	 	up	--	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	have	 book 	 s 	 	,	cds	,	dvds	,	or	 video 	 s 	 	 ly 	 ing 	 	around	your	house	that	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	wo	n't	use	 aga 	 in 	 	,	but	you	ca	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	 br 	 ing 	 	 your 	 self 	 	to	throw	away	?
ca	n't	see	all	the	 hand 	 s 	 	,	but	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	all	of	you	,	right	?
on	our	 shelv 	 es 	 	at	home	,	we	have	a	box	set	of	the	dvd	 s 	 eries 	 	``	24	,	``	season	six	to	be	precise	.
i	think	it	was	 b 	 ought 	 	for	us	around	three	 year 	 s 	 	ago	for	a	christmas	present	.
now	my	husband	,	chris	,	and	i	love	 th 	 is 	 	show	.
but	let	's	face	it	,	when	you	've	 watch 	 ed 	 	it	once	 may 	 be 	 	,	or	twice	,	you	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	watch	it	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	know	how	jack	bauer	is	going	to	defeat	the	 terrorist 	 s 	 	.
so	there	it	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	on	our	 shelv 	 es 	 	 obsolet 	 e 	 	to	us	,	but	with	 im 	 mediate 	 	 lat 	 ent 	 	value	to	 some 	 one 	 	else	.
now	before	we	go	on	,	i	have	a	 confess 	 ion 	 	to	make	.
i	lived	in	new	york	for	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	i	am	a	big	fan	of	``	 s 	 ex 	 	and	the	city	.	``
now	i	'd	love	to	watch	the	first	movie	 aga 	 in 	 	 a 	 s 	 	sort	of	a	warm	-	up	to	the	 s 	 equ 	 el 	 	coming	out	next	week	.
so	how	 eas 	 ily 	 	could	i	swap	our	 un 	 want 	 ed 	 	copy	of	``	24	``	for	a	 want 	 ed 	 	copy	of	``	 s 	 ex 	 	and	the	city	?	``
now	you	may	have	 notice 	 d 	 	there	's	a	new	sector	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	swap	-	 tra 	 d 	 ing 	 	.	now	the	 eas 	 iest 	 	 analog 	 y 	 	for	swap	-	 tra 	 d 	 ing 	 	is	like	an	 on 	 line 	 	 d 	 ating 	 	service	for	all	your	 un 	 want 	 ed 	 	media	.
what	it	 do 	 es 	 	is	use	the	 inter 	 net 	 	to	create	an	infinite	 market 	 place 	 	to	match	person	a	's	``	 have 	 s 	 	``	with	person	c	's	``	 want 	 s 	 	,	``	 what 	 ever 	 	they	may	be	.
the	other	week	,	i	went	on	one	of	these	 s 	 ites 	 	,	 appropriate 	 ly 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	swaptree	,
and	there	 we 	 re 	 	over	59,300	 item 	 s 	 	that	i	could	 instant 	 ly 	 	swap	for	my	copy	of	``	24.	``
lo	and	 be 	 hold 	 	,	there	in	reseda	,	ca	was	rondoron	who	 want 	 ed 	 	swap	his	or	her	``	like	new	``	copy	of	``	 s 	 ex 	 	and	the	city	``	for	my	copy	of	``	24.	``
so	in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	here	is	that	swaptree	 solve 	 s 	 	my	 carry 	 ing 	 	company	's	sugar	rush	problem	,	a	problem	the	 economist 	 s 	 	call	``	the	 co 	 incidence 	 	of	 want 	 s 	 	,	``	in	 approximate 	 ly 	 	60	 second 	 s 	 	.
what	's	even	more	 amaz 	 ing 	 	is	it	will	print	out	a	purchase	label	on	the	spot	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 know 	 s 	 	the	weight	of	the	item	.
now	there	are	 layer 	 s 	 	of	technical	wonder	 be 	 hind 	 	 s 	 ites 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	swaptree	,	but	that	's	not	my	interest	,	and	nor	is	swap	 tra 	 d 	 ing 	 	,	per	 s 	 e 	 	.
my	 pass 	 ion 	 	,	and	what	i	've	 s 	 pent 	 	the	last	few	 year 	 s 	 	 dedicate 	 d 	 	to	 research 	 ing 	 	,	is	the	 collabor 	 ative 	 	 behavior 	 s 	 	and	trust	-	 mechanic 	 s 	 	inherent	in	these	 system 	 s 	 	.
when	you	think	about	it	,	it	would	have	 seem 	 ed 	 	like	a	crazy	idea	,	even	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	that	i	would	swap	my	stuff	with	a	total	 strange 	 r 	 	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	real	name	i	did	n't	know	and	 with 	 out 	 	any	money	changing	 hand 	 s 	 	.	yet	99	percent	of	 trade 	 s 	 	on	swaptree	happen	 success 	 fully 	 	,
and	the	one	percent	that	 receiv 	 e 	 	a	negative	rating	,	it	's	for	 relat 	 ively 	 	minor	 reason 	 s 	 	,	like	the	item	did	n't	 arriv 	 e 	 	on	time	.
so	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	here	?
an	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	dynamic	that	 ha 	 s 	 	huge	commercial	and	cultural	 implic 	 ations 	 	is	at	play	.
 name 	 ly 	 	,	that	technology	is	 enabl 	 ing 	 	trust	between	 strange 	 rs 	 	.
we	now	live	in	a	global	village	where	we	can	mimic	the	ties	that	used	to	happen	face	to	face	,	but	on	a	scale	and	in	ways	that	have	never	 be 	 en 	 	possible	before	.
so	what	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	is	that	social	 network 	 s 	 	and	real	-	time	 techno 	 logies 	 	are	taking	us	back	.
we	're	 bar 	 tering 	 	,	 tra 	 d 	 ing 	 	,	 swap 	 ping 	 	,	sharing	,	but	they	're	 be 	 ing 	 	 re 	 invent 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	dynamic	and	 appeal 	 ing 	 	 form 	 s 	 	.
what	i	find	 fasci 	 nating 	 	is	that	we	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	wired	our	world	to	share	,	 whet 	 her 	 	that	's	our	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	,	our	school	,	our	 off 	 ice 	 	,	or	our	facebook	network	,
and	that	's	creating	an	 eco 	 nomy 	 	of	``	what	's	mine	is	 your 	 s 	 	.	``
from	the	 might 	 y 	 	ebay	,	the	 grand 	 father 	 	of	 ex 	 change 	 	 market 	 place 	 s 	 	,	to	car	-	sharing	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	goget	,	where	you	pay	a	 month 	 ly 	 	fee	to	rent	 car 	 s 	 	by	the	hour	,	to	social	 lend 	 ing 	 	 platform 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	zopa	,	that	will	take	 any 	 one 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	audience	with	100	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	lend	,	and	match	them	with	a	 borrow 	 er 	 	 any 	 where 	 	in	the	world	,	we	're	sharing	and	 collabor 	 ating 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	in	ways	that	i	 believ 	 e 	 	are	more	hip	than	 hip 	 pie 	 	.
i	call	 th 	 is 	 	``	 ground 	 s 	 well 	 	 collabor 	 ative 	 	consumption	.	``
now	before	i	dig	 in 	 to 	 	the	different	 system 	 s 	 	of	 collabor 	 ative 	 	consumption	,	i	'd	like	to	try	and	answer	the	question	that	every	author	 right 	 fully 	 	 get 	 s 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	which	is	,	where	did	 th 	 is 	 	idea	come	from	?
now	i	'd	like	to	say	i	 wok 	 e 	 	up	one	 morn 	 ing 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'm	going	to	write	about	 collabor 	 ative 	 	consumption	,	``
but	 actual 	 ly 	 	it	was	a	 complic 	 ated 	 	web	of	 seem 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 dis 	 connect 	 ed 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	.
over	the	next	minute	,	you	're	going	to	see	a	bit	like	a	conceptual	 fire 	 work 	 s 	 	 dis 	 play 	 	of	all	the	 dot 	 s 	 	that	went	on	in	my	head	.
the	first	thing	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	notice	:	how	 man 	 y 	 	big	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	--	from	the	 wis 	 dom 	 	of	 crowd 	 s 	 	to	smart	 mob 	 s 	 	--	around	how	 ridicul 	 ously 	 	easy	it	is	to	form	 group 	 s 	 	for	a	purpose	.
and	linked	to	 th 	 is 	 	crowd	mania	 we 	 re 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	all	around	the	world	--	from	the	election	of	a	 p 	 resident 	 	to	the	 in 	 famous 	 	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	,	and	 every 	 thing 	 	in	between	--	on	what	the	power	of	 number 	 s 	 	could	 achiev 	 e 	 	.
now	,	you	know	when	you	learn	a	new	word	,	and	then	you	start	to	see	that	word	 every 	 where 	 	?
that	's	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	me	when	i	 notice 	 d 	 	that	we	are	moving	from	 pass 	 ive 	 	 consumer 	 s 	 	to	 creator 	 s 	 	,	to	 high 	 ly 	 	enabled	 collabor 	 ators 	 	.
what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	is	the	 inter 	 net 	 	is	 re 	 moving 	 	the	 middle 	 man 	 	,	so	that	 any 	 one 	 	from	a	t	-	shirt	 design 	 er 	 	to	a	 knit 	 ter 	 	can	make	a	living	selling	peer	-	to	-	peer	.
and	the	 ubiqu 	 it 	 ous 	 	force	of	 th 	 is 	 	peer	-	to	-	peer	revolution	 mean 	 s 	 	that	sharing	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	at	 phenomen 	 al 	 	rates	.
i	mean	,	it	's	 amaz 	 ing 	 	to	think	that	,	in	every	single	minute	of	 th 	 is 	 	speech	,	25	 hour 	 s 	 	of	youtube	video	will	be	 load 	 ed 	 	.
now	what	i	find	 fasci 	 nating 	 	about	these	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	is	how	they	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 tap 	 ping 	 	 in 	 to 	 	our	 prim 	 ate 	 	 instinct 	 s 	 	.
i	mean	,	we	're	 monkey 	 s 	 	,	and	we	're	born	and	 br 	 ed 	 	to	share	and	cooperate	.
and	we	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	so	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	when	we	 hunt 	 ed 	 	in	 pack 	 s 	 	,	or	 farm 	 ed 	 	in	 co 	 operative 	 s 	 	,	before	 th 	 is 	 	big	system	 call 	 ed 	 	hyper	-	consumption	came	 a 	 long 	 	and	we	built	these	 f 	 ence 	 s 	 	and	 create 	 d 	 	out	own	little	fiefdoms	.
but	 thing 	 s 	 	are	changing	,	and	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	why	is	the	digital	 native 	 s 	 	,	or	gen	-	y	.
they	're	growing	up	sharing	--	 file 	 s 	 	,	video	 game 	 s 	 	,	knowledge	.	it	's	second	nature	to	them	.
so	we	,	the	 millennia 	 l 	 s 	 	--	i	am	just	a	 millennia 	 l 	 	--	are	like	foot	 soldier 	 s 	 	,	moving	us	from	a	culture	of	``	me	``	to	a	culture	of	``	we	.	``
the	reason	why	it	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	so	fast	is	 be 	 cause 	 	of	mobile	 collabor 	 ation 	 	.
we	now	live	in	a	 connect 	 ed 	 	age	where	we	can	locate	 any 	 one 	 	,	 any 	 time 	 	,	in	real	-	time	,	from	a	small	 de 	 vice 	 	in	our	 hand 	 s 	 	.
all	of	 th 	 is 	 	was	going	through	my	head	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	end	of	2008	,	when	,	of	course	,	the	great	financial	crash	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
thomas	friedman	is	one	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	 column 	 ists 	 	,	and	he	 poignant 	 ly 	 	 comment 	 ed 	 	that	2008	is	when	we	hit	a	wall	,	when	mother	nature	and	the	market	both	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	more	.	``
now	we	 ration 	 ally 	 	know	that	an	 eco 	 nomy 	 	built	on	hyper	-	consumption	is	a	ponzi	scheme	.	it	's	a	house	of	 card 	 s 	 	.
yet	,	it	's	hard	for	us	to	 individual 	 ly 	 	know	what	to	do	.
so	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	lot	of	 t 	 wit 	 tering 	 	,	right	?
well	it	was	a	lot	of	noise	and	 complex 	 ity 	 	in	my	head	,	 un 	 til 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	i	 real 	 ized 	 	it	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	four	key	 driver 	 s 	 	.
one	,	a	 renew 	 ed 	 	belief	in	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	community	,	and	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 re 	 definition 	 	of	what	friend	and	neighbor	 re 	 ally 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	.
a	 tor 	 rent 	 	of	peer	-	to	-	peer	social	 network 	 s 	 	and	real	-	time	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	changing	the	way	we	 behav 	 e 	 	.
three	,	 press 	 ing 	 	 un 	 resolved 	 	 environment 	 al 	 	 concern 	 s 	 	.
and	four	,	a	global	 recess 	 ion 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	 shock 	 ed 	 	consumer	 behavior 	 s 	 	.
these	four	 driver 	 s 	 	are	fusing	together	and	creating	the	big	shift	--	away	from	the	20th	century	,	defined	by	hyper	-	consumption	,	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	21st	century	,	defined	by	 collabor 	 ative 	 	consumption	.
i	 general 	 ly 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	we	're	at	an	 inf 	 le 	 ction 	 	point	where	the	sharing	 behavior 	 s 	 	--	through	 s 	 ites 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	flickr	and	twitter	that	are	 be 	 coming 	 	second	nature	 on 	 line 	 	--	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 appli 	 ed 	 	to	 off 	 line 	 	 area 	 s 	 	of	our	 every 	 day 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
from	 morn 	 ing 	 	 commute 	 s 	 	to	the	way	fashion	is	designed	to	the	way	we	grow	food	,	we	are	 consum 	 ing 	 	and	 collabor 	 ating 	 	once	 aga 	 in 	 	.
so	my	co	-	author	,	roo	rogers	,	and	i	have	 actual 	 ly 	 	 gather 	 ed 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	from	all	around	the	world	of	 collabor 	 ative 	 	consumption	.
and	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	they	vary	 enormous 	 ly 	 	in	scale	,	 matur 	 ity 	 	and	purpose	,	when	we	 div 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	them	,	we	 real 	 ized 	 	that	they	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	 organize 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	three	clear	 system 	 s 	 	.
the	first	is	 re 	 distribut 	 ion 	 	 market 	 s 	 	.
 re 	 distribut 	 ion 	 	 market 	 s 	 	,	just	like	swaptree	,	are	when	you	take	a	used	,	or	pre	-	owned	,	item	and	move	it	from	where	it	's	not	 need 	 ed 	 	to	 some 	 where 	 	,	or	 some 	 one 	 	,	where	it	is	.
they	're	 increasing 	 ly 	 	thought	of	 a 	 s 	 	the	fifth	'	r	'	--	 reduc 	 e 	 	,	 re 	 use 	 	,	 re 	 cycle 	 	,	repair	and	 re 	 distribut 	 e 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	they	stretch	the	life	cycle	of	a	product	and	 there 	 by 	 	 reduc 	 e 	 	waste	.
the	second	is	 collabor 	 ative 	 	 life 	 style 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	sharing	of	 resource 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	like	money	,	 skill 	 s 	 	and	time	.
i	bet	,	in	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	that	 phrase 	 s 	 	like	``	 co 	 work 	 ing 	 	``	and	``	 couch 	 surfing 	 	``	and	``	time	 bank 	 s 	 	``	are	going	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	part	of	 every 	 day 	 	 ver 	 na 	 cular 	 	.
one	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	 collabor 	 ative 	 	 life 	 style 	 s 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	landshare	.
it	's	a	scheme	in	the	u.k.	that	 match 	 es 	 	mr.	jones	,	with	some	spare	space	in	his	back	garden	,	with	mrs.	smith	,	a	would	-	be	 grow 	 er 	 	.
together	they	grow	 the 	 ir 	 	own	food	.
it	's	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	that	's	so	simple	,	yet	 brilli 	 ant 	 	,	you	wonder	why	it	's	never	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	before	.
now	,	the	third	system	is	product	-	service	 system 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	where	you	pay	for	the	benefit	of	the	product	--	what	it	 do 	 es 	 	for	you	--	 with 	 out 	 	 need 	 ing 	 	to	own	the	product	 out 	 right 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	idea	is	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	for	 thing 	 s 	 	that	have	high	-	 idl 	 ing 	 	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	.
and	that	can	be	 any 	 thing 	 	from	baby	 good 	 s 	 	to	 fashion 	 s 	 	to	--	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	have	a	power	drill	,
own	a	power	drill	?	right	.
that	power	drill	will	be	used	around	12	to	13	 minute 	 s 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	entire	 life 	 time 	 	.
it	's	kind	of	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	,	right	?
 be 	 cause 	 	what	you	need	is	the	hole	,	not	the	drill	.
so	why	do	n't	you	rent	the	drill	,	or	,	even	better	,	rent	out	your	own	drill	to	other	people	and	make	some	money	from	it	?
these	three	 system 	 s 	 	are	coming	together	,	 allow 	 ing 	 	people	to	share	 resource 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 sacri 	 f 	 ic 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 life 	 style 	 s 	 	,	or	 the 	 ir 	 	 cher 	 ish 	 ed 	 	personal	 free 	 dom 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	not	 ask 	 ing 	 	people	to	share	 nice 	 ly 	 	in	the	 sand 	 pit 	 	.
so	i	want	to	just	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	how	 power 	 ful 	 	 collabor 	 ative 	 	consumption	can	be	to	change	 behavior 	 s 	 	.
the	average	car	 cost 	 s 	 	8,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	to	run	.
yet	,	that	car	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	 idl 	 e 	 	for	23	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	.
so	when	you	consider	these	two	 fact 	 s 	 	,	it	 start 	 s 	 	to	make	a	little	less	sense	that	we	have	to	own	one	 out 	 right 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	car	-	sharing	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	zipcar	and	goget	come	in	.
in	2009	,	zipcar	took	250	 particip 	 ants 	 	from	 a 	 cross 	 	13	cities	--	and	they	're	all	self	-	 confess 	 ed 	 	car	 addict 	 s 	 	and	car	-	sharing	 rook 	 ies 	 	--	and	got	them	to	surrender	 the 	 ir 	 	 key 	 s 	 	for	a	month	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	these	people	had	to	walk	,	bike	,	take	the	train	,	or	other	 form 	 s 	 	of	public	transport	.
they	could	 on 	 ly 	 	use	 the 	 ir 	 	zipcar	 member 	 ship 	 	when	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 necess 	 ary 	 	.
the	 result 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 challeng 	 e 	 	after	just	one	month	was	 stagger 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	 amaz 	 ing 	 	that	413	 lb 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	lost	just	from	the	extra	 exercis 	 e 	 	.
but	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	statistic	is	that	100	out	of	the	250	 particip 	 ants 	 	did	not	want	 the 	 ir 	 	 key 	 s 	 	back	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	the	car	 addict 	 s 	 	had	lost	 the 	 ir 	 	urge	to	own	.
now	 product 	 s 	 	-	service	 system 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	around	for	 year 	 s 	 	.
just	think	of	 lib 	 r 	 aries 	 	and	 laundr 	 ette 	 s 	 	.
but	i	think	they	're	 enter 	 ing 	 	a	new	age	,	 be 	 cause 	 	technology	 make 	 s 	 	sharing	 friction 	 less 	 	and	 f 	 un 	 	.
there	's	a	great	quote	that	was	written	in	the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	that	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	sharing	is	to	 owner 	 ship 	 	what	the	ipod	is	to	the	8	-	track	,	what	solar	power	is	to	the	coal	mine	.	``
i	 believ 	 e 	 	 al 	 so 	 	,	our	generation	,	our	relationship	to	 satisfy 	 ing 	 	what	we	want	is	far	less	tangible	than	any	other	previous	generation	.
i	do	n't	want	the	dvd	;	i	want	the	movie	it	 car 	 ries 	 	.
i	do	n't	want	a	 clunk 	 y 	 	 answer 	 ing 	 	machine	;	i	want	the	 mess 	 age 	 	it	 s 	 ave 	 s 	 	.
i	do	n't	want	a	cd	;	i	want	the	music	it	 play 	 s 	 	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	i	do	n't	want	stuff	;	i	want	the	 need 	 s 	 	or	 experience 	 s 	 	it	 fulfill 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 fuel 	 ing 	 	a	massive	shift	from	where	 us 	 age 	 	 trump 	 s 	 	 possess 	 ions 	 	--	or	 a 	 s 	 	kevin	kelly	,	the	editor	of	wired	magazine	,	 put 	 s 	 	it	,	``	where	access	is	better	than	 owner 	 ship 	 	.	``
now	 a 	 s 	 	our	 possess 	 ions 	 	 de 	 material 	 ize 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	cloud	,	a	 blur 	 ry 	 	line	is	 appear 	 ing 	 	between	what	's	mine	,	what	's	 your 	 s 	 	,	and	what	's	 our 	 s 	 	.
i	want	to	give	you	one	 ex 	 ample 	 	that	 show 	 s 	 	how	fast	 th 	 is 	 	evolution	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 represent 	 s 	 	an	eight	-	year	time	span	.
we	've	gone	from	 tradition 	 al 	 	car	-	 owner 	 ship 	 	to	car	-	sharing	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	zipcar	and	goget	,	to	ride	-	sharing	 platform 	 s 	 	that	match	 ride 	 s 	 	to	the	 new 	 est 	 	entry	,	which	is	peer	-	to	-	peer	car	 rent 	 al 	 	,	where	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	make	money	out	of	 rent 	 ing 	 	that	car	that	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	 idl 	 e 	 	for	23	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	to	your	neighbor	.
now	all	of	these	 system 	 s 	 	 requir 	 e 	 	a	degree	of	trust	,	and	the	 corner 	 stone 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	is	reputation	.	now	in	the	old	consumer	system	,	our	reputation	did	n't	matter	so	much	,	 be 	 cause 	 	our	credit	 histo 	 ry 	 	was	far	more	 import 	 ant 	 	that	any	kind	of	peer	-	to	-	peer	review	.
but	now	with	the	web	,	we	 leav 	 e 	 	a	trail	.
with	every	 spam 	 mer 	 	we	flag	,	with	every	idea	we	post	,	comment	we	share	,	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 signal 	 ing 	 	how	well	we	 collabor 	 ate 	 	,	and	 whet 	 her 	 	we	can	or	ca	n't	be	 trust 	 ed 	 	.
let	's	go	back	to	my	first	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	swaptree	.
i	can	see	that	rondoron	 ha 	 s 	 	 complete 	 d 	 	553	 trade 	 s 	 	with	a	100	percent	success	rate	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	i	can	trust	him	or	her	.
now	mark	my	 word 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	a	matter	of	time	before	we	're	going	to	be	able	to	perform	a	google	-	like	search	and	see	a	cumulative	picture	of	our	reputation	capital	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	reputation	capital	will	determine	our	access	to	 collabor 	 ative 	 	consumption	.
it	's	a	new	social	 curr 	 ency 	 	,	so	to	speak	,	that	could	 be 	 come 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	 a 	 s 	 	our	credit	rating	.
now	 a 	 s 	 	a	 clo 	 s 	 ing 	 	thought	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	in	a	period	where	we	're	 wa 	 king 	 	up	from	 th 	 is 	 	 hum 	 ong 	 ous 	 	 hang 	 over 	 	of	 empti 	 ness 	 	and	waste	,	and	we	're	taking	a	leap	to	create	a	more	 sustain 	 able 	 	system	built	to	serve	our	innate	 need 	 s 	 	for	community	and	individual	 ident 	 ity 	 	.
