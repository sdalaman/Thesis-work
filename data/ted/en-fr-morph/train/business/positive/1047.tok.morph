there	are	two	 group 	 s 	 	of	women	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	 screen 	 ing 	 	 mamm 	 ography 	 	--	women	in	whom	 mamm 	 ography 	 	 work 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	well	and	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 live 	 s 	 	and	women	in	whom	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	well	at	all	.
do	you	know	which	group	you	're	in	?
if	you	do	n't	,	you	're	not	 al 	 one 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	breast	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 politic 	 al 	 	organ	.
the	truth	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	lost	in	all	the	rhetoric	coming	from	the	press	,	 politic 	 ians 	 	,	 radio 	 logists 	 	and	medical	 im 	 aging 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.
i	will	do	my	best	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	to	tell	you	what	i	think	is	the	truth	.
but	first	,	my	 dis 	 closure 	 s 	 	.
i	am	not	a	breast	cancer	 surviv 	 or 	 	.
i	'm	not	a	 radio 	 logist 	 	.
i	do	n't	have	any	 patent 	 s 	 	,	and	i	've	never	 receiv 	 ed 	 	any	money	from	a	medical	 im 	 aging 	 	company	,
and	i	am	not	seeking	your	vote	.
what	i	am	is	a	doctor	of	internal	medicine	who	 be 	 came 	 	 passionate 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 top 	 ic 	 	about	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	when	a	patient	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	a	question	.
she	came	to	see	me	after	 discover 	 ing 	 	a	breast	lump	.
her	sister	had	 be 	 en 	 	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	with	breast	cancer	in	her	40s	.
she	and	i	 we 	 re 	 	both	 ver 	 y 	 	 pregn 	 ant 	 	at	that	time	,	and	my	heart	just	 ach 	 ed 	 	for	her	,	 imagin 	 ing 	 	how	 af 	 raid 	 	she	must	be	.
 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	her	lump	 prov 	 ed 	 	to	be	benign	.
but	she	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	a	question	:	how	confident	was	i	that	i	would	find	a	tumor	early	on	her	 mamm 	 ogram 	 	if	she	 develop 	 ed 	 	one	?
so	i	 stud 	 ied 	 	her	 mamm 	 ogram 	 	,	and	i	 review 	 ed 	 	the	 radio 	 logy 	 	 liter 	 ature 	 	,	and	i	was	 shock 	 ed 	 	to	discover	that	,	in	her	case	,	our	 chance 	 s 	 	of	 find 	 ing 	 	a	tumor	early	on	the	 mamm 	 ogram 	 	 we 	 re 	 	less	than	the	 to 	 s 	 s 	 	of	a	 co 	 in 	 	.
you	may	recall	a	year	ago	when	a	 fire 	 storm 	 	 erupt 	 ed 	 	after	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 prevent 	 ive 	 	 service 	 s 	 	task	force	 review 	 ed 	 	the	world	's	 mamm 	 ography 	 	 screen 	 ing 	 	 liter 	 ature 	 	and	 issue 	 d 	 	a	 guide 	 line 	 	 recommend 	 ing 	 	against	 screen 	 ing 	 	 mamm 	 ogram 	 s 	 	in	women	in	 the 	 ir 	 	40s	.
now	 every 	 body 	 	 rush 	 ed 	 	to	 critic 	 ize 	 	the	task	force	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	most	of	them	 we 	 re 	 	n't	in	 any 	 way 	 	familiar	with	the	 mamm 	 ography 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	.
it	took	the	senate	just	17	 day 	 s 	 	to	ban	the	use	of	the	 guide 	 lines 	 	in	 determi 	 ning 	 	 insur 	 ance 	 	 cover 	 age 	 	.
 radio 	 logists 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 out 	 rag 	 ed 	 	by	the	 guide 	 lines 	 	.
the	pre	-	eminent	 mamm 	 ographer 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 issue 	 d 	 	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	quote	to	the	washington	post	.
the	 radio 	 logists 	 	 we 	 re 	 	,	in	turn	,	 critic 	 ized 	 	for	 protect 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	financial	self	-	interest	.
but	in	my	view	,	the	 radio 	 logists 	 	are	heroes	.
there	's	a	 short 	 age 	 	of	 radio 	 logists 	 	 qual 	 ified 	 	to	read	 mamm 	 ogram 	 s 	 	,	and	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	 mamm 	 ogram 	 s 	 	are	one	of	the	most	complex	of	all	 radio 	 logy 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	to	interpret	,	and	 be 	 cause 	 	 radio 	 logists 	 	are	 su 	 ed 	 	more	often	over	 mis 	 s 	 ed 	 	breast	cancer	than	any	other	cause	.
but	that	 ver 	 y 	 	fact	is	 tell 	 ing 	 	.
where	there	is	 th 	 is 	 	much	legal	smoke	,	there	is	 like 	 ly 	 	to	be	some	fire	.
the	factor	most	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	that	fire	is	breast	density	.
breast	density	 refer 	 s 	 	to	the	 relat 	 ive 	 	amount	of	fat	--	 picture 	 d 	 	here	in	yellow	--	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	 connect 	 ive 	 	and	 epit 	 hel 	 ial 	 	 tissue 	 s 	 	--	 picture 	 d 	 	in	pink	.
and	that	proportion	is	 prim 	 arily 	 	 genetic 	 ally 	 	 determine 	 d 	 	.
two	-	 third 	 s 	 	of	women	in	 the 	 ir 	 	40s	have	dense	breast	tissue	,
which	is	why	 mamm 	 ography 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	 a 	 s 	 	well	in	them	.
and	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	breast	density	 general 	 ly 	 	 decline 	 s 	 	with	age	,	up	to	a	third	of	women	retain	dense	breast	tissue	for	 year 	 s 	 	after	 men 	 o 	 pause 	 	.
so	how	do	you	know	if	your	 breast 	 s 	 	are	dense	?
well	,	you	need	to	read	the	 detail 	 s 	 	of	your	 mamm 	 ography 	 	report	.
 radio 	 logists 	 	 class 	 ify 	 	breast	density	 in 	 to 	 	four	 categor 	 ies 	 	based	on	the	 appear 	 ance 	 	of	the	tissue	on	a	 mamm 	 ogram 	 	.
if	the	breast	is	less	than	25	percent	dense	,	that	's	 call 	 ed 	 	fatty	-	 replace 	 d 	 	.
the	next	 categor 	 y 	 	is	 scatter 	 ed 	 	 fibro 	 g 	 land 	 ular 	 	 den 	 s 	 ities 	 	,	 follow 	 ed 	 	by	 heterogeneous 	 ly 	 	dense	and	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	dense	.
and	 breast 	 s 	 	that	fall	 in 	 to 	 	these	two	 categor 	 ies 	 	are	 consider 	 ed 	 	dense	.
the	problem	with	breast	density	is	that	it	's	 tru 	 ly 	 	the	wolf	in	sheep	's	 cloth 	 ing 	 	.
both	 tumor 	 s 	 	and	dense	breast	tissue	appear	white	on	a	 mamm 	 ogram 	 	,	and	the	x	-	ray	often	ca	n't	distinguish	between	the	two	.
so	it	's	easy	to	see	 th 	 is 	 	tumor	in	the	upper	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	fatty	breast	.
but	imagine	how	difficult	it	would	be	to	find	that	tumor	in	 th 	 is 	 	dense	breast	.
that	's	why	 mamm 	 ogram 	 s 	 	find	over	80	percent	of	 tumor 	 s 	 	in	fatty	 breast 	 s 	 	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	few	 a 	 s 	 	40	percent	in	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	dense	 breast 	 s 	 	.
now	it	's	bad	 en 	 ough 	 	that	breast	density	 make 	 s 	 	it	hard	to	find	a	cancer	,	but	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	 power 	 ful 	 	 predict 	 or 	 	of	your	risk	for	breast	cancer	.
it	's	a	 strong 	 er 	 	risk	factor	than	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	mother	or	a	sister	with	breast	cancer	.
at	the	time	my	patient	posed	 th 	 is 	 	question	to	me	,	breast	density	was	an	 obscur 	 e 	 	 top 	 ic 	 	in	the	 radio 	 logy 	 	 liter 	 ature 	 	,	and	 ver 	 y 	 	few	women	 hav 	 ing 	 	 mamm 	 ogram 	 s 	 	,	or	the	 physician 	 s 	 	 order 	 ing 	 	them	,	 k 	 new 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	what	else	could	i	 off 	 er 	 	her	?
 mamm 	 ogram 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	around	since	the	1960	's	,
and	it	's	 change 	 d 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	little	.
there	have	 be 	 en 	 	 surprising 	 ly 	 	few	 innov 	 ations 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	digital	 mamm 	 ography 	 	was	approved	in	2000	.
digital	 mamm 	 ography 	 	is	still	an	x	-	ray	of	the	breast	,	but	the	 image 	 s 	 	can	be	 store 	 d 	 	and	 manipul 	 ated 	 	 digital 	 ly 	 	,	just	like	we	can	with	a	digital	camera	.
the	u.s.	 ha 	 s 	 	 invest 	 ed 	 	four	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	 convert 	 ing 	 	to	digital	 mamm 	 ography 	 	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	,
and	what	have	we	 gain 	 ed 	 	from	that	 invest 	 ment 	 	?
in	a	 stud 	 y 	 	funded	by	over	25	million	taxpayer	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	digital	 mamm 	 ography 	 	was	found	to	be	no	better	over	all	than	 tradition 	 al 	 	 mamm 	 ography 	 	,
and	in	fact	,	it	was	 wo 	 rse 	 	in	 old 	 er 	 	women	.
but	it	was	better	in	one	group	,	and	that	was	women	under	50	who	 we 	 re 	 	pre	-	menopausal	and	had	dense	 breast 	 s 	 	,
and	in	 t 	 hose 	 	women	,	digital	 mamm 	 ography 	 	found	twice	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 cancer 	 s 	 	,	but	it	still	 on 	 ly 	 	found	60	percent	.
so	digital	 mamm 	 ography 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	giant	leap	forward	for	 manufactur 	 ers 	 	of	digital	 mamm 	 ography 	 	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	,	but	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	step	forward	for	 woman 	 kind 	 	.
what	about	 ultra 	 sound 	 	?
 ultra 	 sound 	 	 generate 	 s 	 	more	 bio 	 psies 	 	that	are	 un 	 necess 	 ary 	 	 relat 	 ive 	 	to	other	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	so	it	's	not	 wide 	 ly 	 	used	.
and	mri	is	 exquisite 	 ly 	 	sensitive	for	 find 	 ing 	 	 tumor 	 s 	 	,	but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	expensive	.
if	we	think	about	 disrupt 	 ive 	 	technology	,	we	see	an	 al 	 most 	 	 ubiqu 	 it 	 ous 	 	pattern	of	the	technology	 get 	 ting 	 	 small 	 er 	 	and	less	expensive	.
think	about	ipods	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	 stereo 	 s 	 	.
but	it	's	the	exact	 oppos 	 ite 	 	in	health	care	.
the	 machine 	 s 	 	get	ever	 big 	 ger 	 	and	ever	more	expensive	.
 screen 	 ing 	 	the	average	young	woman	with	an	mri	is	kind	of	like	 driv 	 ing 	 	to	the	 grocer 	 y 	 	store	in	a	hummer	.
it	's	just	way	too	much	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	.
one	mri	 s 	 can 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	10	 time 	 s 	 	what	a	digital	 mamm 	 ogram 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	.
and	 soon 	 er 	 	or	 lat 	 er 	 	,	we	're	going	to	have	to	accept	the	fact	that	health	care	 innov 	 ation 	 	ca	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	come	at	a	much	 high 	 er 	 	price	.
malcolm	gladwell	wrote	an	article	in	the	new	yorker	on	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	and	he	made	the	case	that	scientific	 discover 	 ies 	 	are	 rare 	 ly 	 	the	product	of	one	individual	's	 gen 	 ius 	 	.
 ra 	 ther 	 	,	big	 idea 	 s 	 	can	be	 orchestra 	 ted 	 	,	if	you	can	 simpl 	 y 	 	gather	people	with	different	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 s 	 	in	a	room	and	get	them	to	talk	about	 thing 	 s 	 	that	they	do	n't	 ordinari 	 ly 	 	talk	about	.
it	's	like	the	 es 	 s 	 ence 	 	of	ted	.
he	 quote 	 s 	 	one	 innov 	 ator 	 	who	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	the	 on 	 ly 	 	time	a	physician	and	a	physicist	get	together	is	when	the	physicist	 get 	 s 	 	sick	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	 make 	 s 	 	no	sense	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 physician 	 s 	 	have	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 problem 	 s 	 	that	they	do	n't	 real 	 ize 	 	have	 solution 	 s 	 	.
and	 physicist 	 s 	 	have	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 solution 	 s 	 	for	 thing 	 s 	 	that	they	do	n't	 real 	 ize 	 	are	 problem 	 s 	 	.
now	,	take	a	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	cartoon	that	 accompani 	 ed 	 	gladwell	's	article	,	and	tell	me	if	you	see	 some 	 thing 	 	 disturb 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	 depict 	 ion 	 	of	 innov 	 ative 	 	 think 	 ers 	 	.
so	if	you	will	allow	me	a	little	creative	 licens 	 e 	 	,	i	will	tell	you	the	story	of	the	serendipitous	collision	of	my	patient	's	problem	with	a	physicist	's	solution	.
 short 	 ly 	 	after	her	visit	,	i	was	 introduc 	 ed 	 	to	a	nuclear	physicist	at	mayo	named	michael	o'conner	,	who	was	a	 special 	 ist 	 	in	cardiac	 im 	 aging 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	i	had	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	.
and	he	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	tell	me	about	a	 con 	 ference 	 	he	'd	just	 return 	 ed 	 	from	in	israel	,	where	they	 we 	 re 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	a	new	type	of	 gam 	 ma 	 	 detect 	 or 	 	.
now	 gam 	 ma 	 	 im 	 aging 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	around	for	a	long	time	to	image	the	heart	,	and	it	had	even	 be 	 en 	 	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	image	the	breast	.
but	the	problem	was	that	the	 gam 	 ma 	 	 detect 	 ors 	 	 we 	 re 	 	these	huge	,	 bulk 	 y 	 	 tube 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	these	 s 	 c 	 in 	 till 	 ating 	 	 crystal 	 s 	 	,	and	you	just	could	n't	get	them	close	 en 	 ough 	 	around	the	breast	to	find	small	 tumor 	 s 	 	.
but	the	potential	advantage	was	that	 gam 	 ma 	 	 ray 	 s 	 	,	 un 	 like 	 	x	-	 ray 	 s 	 	,	are	not	 influence 	 d 	 	by	breast	density	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	technology	could	not	find	 tumor 	 s 	 	when	they	're	small	,
and	 find 	 ing 	 	a	small	tumor	is	critical	for	 surviv 	 al 	 	.
if	you	can	find	a	tumor	when	it	's	less	than	a	centimeter	,	 surviv 	 al 	 	 exceed 	 s 	 	90	percent	,	but	 drop 	 s 	 	off	 rapid 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	tumor	 s 	 ize 	 	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	.
but	michael	told	me	about	a	new	type	of	 gam 	 ma 	 	 detect 	 or 	 	that	he	'd	 s 	 een 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	it	.
it	's	made	not	of	a	 bulk 	 y 	 	tube	,	but	of	a	thin	layer	of	a	 semi 	 conductor 	 	material	that	 serve 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 gam 	 ma 	 	 detect 	 or 	 	.
and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	him	about	 th 	 is 	 	problem	with	breast	density	,	and	we	 real 	 ized 	 	that	we	might	be	able	to	get	 th 	 is 	 	 detect 	 or 	 	close	 en 	 ough 	 	around	the	breast	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	find	small	 tumor 	 s 	 	.
so	after	 put 	 ting 	 	together	a	grid	of	these	 cube 	 s 	 	with	tape	--	--	michael	 hack 	 ed 	 	off	the	x	-	ray	plate	of	a	 mamm 	 ography 	 	machine	that	was	about	to	be	 throw 	 n 	 	out	,
and	we	 attach 	 ed 	 	the	new	 detect 	 or 	 	,	and	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	call	 th 	 is 	 	machine	 mole 	 cular 	 	breast	 im 	 aging 	 	,	or	mbi	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	image	from	our	first	patient	.
and	you	can	see	,	using	the	old	 gam 	 ma 	 	technology	,	that	it	just	 look 	 ed 	 	like	noise	.
but	using	our	new	 detect 	 or 	 	,	we	could	begin	to	see	the	 out 	 line 	 	of	a	tumor	.
so	here	we	 we 	 re 	 	,	a	nuclear	physicist	,	an	 intern 	 ist 	 	,	soon	 join 	 ed 	 	by	carrie	hruska	,	a	 bio 	 medical 	 	engineer	,	and	two	 radio 	 logists 	 	,	and	we	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	take	on	the	 en 	 trench 	 ed 	 	world	of	 mamm 	 ography 	 	with	a	machine	that	was	held	together	by	duct	tape	.
to	say	that	we	 face 	 d 	 	high	 dose 	 s 	 	of	 skeptic 	 ism 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	early	 year 	 s 	 	is	just	a	huge	 under 	 state 	 ment 	 	,
but	we	 we 	 re 	 	so	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	that	we	might	be	able	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	work	that	we	 chip 	 ped 	 	away	with	 increment 	 al 	 	 mod 	 ification 	 s 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	system	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	our	current	 detect 	 or 	 	.
and	you	can	see	that	it	 look 	 s 	 	a	lot	different	.
the	duct	tape	is	gone	,	and	we	 add 	 ed 	 	a	second	 detect 	 or 	 	on	top	of	the	breast	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	further	 improv 	 ed 	 	our	tumor	 detect 	 ion 	 	.
so	how	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	work	?
the	patient	 receiv 	 es 	 	an	 inject 	 ion 	 	of	a	radio	 trac 	 er 	 	that	's	taken	up	by	 rapid 	 ly 	 	 pro 	 life 	 rating 	 	tumor	 cell 	 s 	 	,	but	not	by	normal	 cell 	 s 	 	,
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	key	 differ 	 ence 	 	from	 mamm 	 ography 	 	.
 mamm 	 ography 	 	 re 	 lies 	 	on	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	in	the	 appear 	 ance 	 	of	the	tumor	from	the	 back 	 ground 	 	tissue	,	and	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	that	 t 	 hose 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	can	be	 obscur 	 ed 	 	in	a	dense	breast	.
but	mbi	 exploit 	 s 	 	the	different	 mole 	 cular 	 	behavior	of	 tumor 	 s 	 	,	and	 there 	 fore 	 	,	it	's	 imper 	 vi 	 ous 	 	to	breast	density	.
after	the	 inject 	 ion 	 	,	the	patient	's	breast	is	 place 	 d 	 	between	the	 detect 	 ors 	 	.
and	if	you	've	ever	had	a	 mamm 	 ogram 	 	--	if	you	're	old	 en 	 ough 	 	to	have	had	a	 mamm 	 ogram 	 	--	you	know	what	 come 	 s 	 	next	:	pain	.
you	may	be	 surprise 	 d 	 	to	know	that	 mamm 	 ography 	 	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 radio 	 logic 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	that	's	 regulat 	 ed 	 	by	federal	law	,	and	the	law	 requir 	 es 	 	that	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	a	40	-	pound	car	 batt 	 ery 	 	come	down	on	your	breast	 dur 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	.
but	with	mbi	,	we	use	just	light	,	pain	-	free	 compress 	 ion 	 	.
and	the	 detect 	 or 	 	then	 transmit 	 s 	 	the	image	to	the	computer	.
so	here	's	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
you	can	see	,	on	the	right	,	a	 mamm 	 ogram 	 	 show 	 ing 	 	a	faint	tumor	,	the	 edge 	 s 	 	of	which	are	 blur 	 red 	 	by	the	dense	tissue	.
but	the	mbi	image	 show 	 s 	 	that	tumor	much	more	 clear 	 ly 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	a	second	tumor	,	which	 pro 	 found 	 ly 	 	influence	that	patient	's	 sur 	 gical 	 	 option 	 s 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	the	 mamm 	 ogram 	 	found	one	tumor	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	 demonst 	 rate 	 	three	discrete	 tumor 	 s 	 	--	one	is	small	 a 	 s 	 	three	 millimeter 	 s 	 	.
our	big	break	came	in	2004	.
after	we	had	 demonst 	 rated 	 	that	we	could	find	small	 tumor 	 s 	 	,	we	used	these	 image 	 s 	 	to	submit	a	grant	to	the	susan	g.	komen	 found 	 ation 	 	.
and	we	 we 	 re 	 	 el 	 ated 	 	when	they	took	a	chance	on	a	team	of	 complete 	 ly 	 	 un 	 known 	 	 invest 	 igator 	 s 	 	and	funded	us	to	 stud 	 y 	 	1,000	women	with	dense	 breast 	 s 	 	,	 compar 	 ing 	 	a	 screen 	 ing 	 	 mamm 	 ogram 	 	to	an	mbi	.
of	the	 tumor 	 s 	 	that	we	found	,	 mamm 	 ography 	 	found	mbi	found	83	percent	.
here	's	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	from	that	 screen 	 ing 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	.
the	digital	 mamm 	 ogram 	 	was	read	 a 	 s 	 	normal	and	 show 	 s 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	dense	tissue	,	but	the	mbi	 show 	 s 	 	an	area	of	 intens 	 e 	 	 up 	 take 	 	,	which	 correlate 	 d 	 	with	a	two	-	centimeter	tumor	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	a	one	-	centimeter	tumor	.
and	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	a	45	-	year	-	old	medical	 secret 	 ary 	 	at	mayo	,	who	had	lost	her	mother	to	breast	cancer	when	she	was	 ver 	 y 	 	young	,	 want 	 ed 	 	to	enroll	in	our	 stud 	 y 	 	.
and	her	 mamm 	 ogram 	 	 show 	 ed 	 	an	area	of	 ver 	 y 	 	dense	tissue	,	but	her	mbi	 show 	 ed 	 	an	area	of	 worri 	 some 	 	 up 	 take 	 	,	which	we	can	 al 	 so 	 	see	on	a	color	image	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 correspond 	 ed 	 	to	a	tumor	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	golf	ball	.
but	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	it	was	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	before	it	had	spread	to	her	lymph	 nod 	 es 	 	.
so	now	that	we	 k 	 new 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	technology	could	find	three	 time 	 s 	 	more	 tumor 	 s 	 	in	a	dense	breast	,	we	had	to	solve	one	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	problem	.
we	had	to	figure	out	how	to	lower	the	 radi 	 ation 	 	dose	,
and	we	have	 s 	 pent 	 	the	last	three	 year 	 s 	 	making	 mod 	 ification 	 s 	 	to	every	 a 	 spect 	 	of	the	 im 	 aging 	 	system	to	allow	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	to	report	that	we	're	now	using	a	dose	of	 radi 	 ation 	 	that	is	 equi 	 valent 	 	to	the	effective	dose	from	one	digital	 mamm 	 ogram 	 	.
and	at	 th 	 is 	 	low	dose	,	we	're	 continu 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 screen 	 ing 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	image	from	three	 week 	 s 	 	ago	in	a	67	-	year	-	old	woman	 show 	 s 	 	a	normal	digital	 mamm 	 ogram 	 	,	but	an	mbi	image	 show 	 ing 	 	an	 up 	 take 	 	that	 prov 	 ed 	 	to	be	a	large	cancer	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	just	young	women	that	it	's	 benefit 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 old 	 er 	 	women	with	dense	tissue	.
and	we	're	now	 routine 	 ly 	 	using	one	-	fifth	the	 radi 	 ation 	 	dose	that	's	used	in	any	other	type	of	 gam 	 ma 	 	technology	.
mbi	 generate 	 s 	 	four	 image 	 s 	 	per	breast	.
mri	 generate 	 s 	 	over	a	thousand	.
it	 take 	 s 	 	a	 radio 	 logist 	 	 year 	 s 	 	of	 special 	 ty 	 	training	to	 be 	 come 	 	expert	in	 different 	 i 	 ating 	 	the	normal	 an 	 atomic 	 	detail	from	the	 worri 	 some 	 	 find 	 ing 	 	.
but	i	suspect	even	the	non	-	 radio 	 logists 	 	in	the	room	can	find	the	tumor	on	the	mbi	image	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	why	mbi	is	so	 potential 	 ly 	 	 disrupt 	 ive 	 	--
it	's	 a 	 s 	 	accurate	 a 	 s 	 	mri	,	it	's	far	less	complex	to	interpret	,	and	it	's	a	fraction	of	the	cost	.
but	you	can	understand	why	there	may	be	 force 	 s 	 	in	the	breast	-	 im 	 aging 	 	world	who	prefer	the	 stat 	 us 	 	quo	.
after	 achiev 	 ing 	 	what	we	felt	 we 	 re 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	 result 	 s 	 	,	our	 man 	 u 	 script 	 	was	 reject 	 ed 	 	by	four	 journal 	 s 	 	.
after	the	fourth	 reject 	 ion 	 	,	we	 request 	 ed 	 	 re 	 consider 	 ation 	 	of	the	 man 	 u 	 script 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 strong 	 ly 	 	 suspect 	 ed 	 	that	one	of	the	 review 	 ers 	 	who	had	 reject 	 ed 	 	it	had	a	financial	conflict	of	interest	in	a	 com 	 pet 	 ing 	 	technology	.
our	 man 	 u 	 script 	 	was	then	 accept 	 ed 	 	and	will	be	 publish 	 ed 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	 th 	 is 	 	month	in	the	journal	 radio 	 logy 	 	.
we	still	need	to	complete	the	 screen 	 ing 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	using	the	low	dose	,	and	then	our	 find 	 ing 	 s 	 	will	need	to	be	 replicate 	 d 	 	at	other	 institution 	 s 	 	,
and	 th 	 is 	 	could	take	five	or	more	 year 	 s 	 	.
if	 th 	 is 	 	technology	is	 wide 	 ly 	 	 adopt 	 ed 	 	,	i	will	not	benefit	 financial 	 ly 	 	in	any	way	,
and	that	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	me	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 allow 	 s 	 	me	to	 continu 	 e 	 	to	tell	you	the	truth	.
but	i	 recogn 	 ize 	 	--	i	 recogn 	 ize 	 	that	the	 adopt 	 ion 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	technology	will	depend	 a 	 s 	 	much	on	economic	and	 politic 	 al 	 	 force 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	will	on	the	 sound 	 ness 	 	of	the	science	.
the	mbi	unit	 ha 	 s 	 	now	 be 	 en 	 	fda	approved	,	but	it	's	not	yet	 wide 	 ly 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	.
so	 un 	 til 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	is	 avail 	 able 	 	for	women	with	dense	 breast 	 s 	 	,	there	are	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	should	know	to	protect	 your 	 self 	 	.
first	,	know	your	density	.
ninety	percent	of	women	do	n't	,	and	95	percent	of	women	do	n't	know	that	it	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	your	breast	cancer	risk	.
the	state	of	connecticut	 be 	 came 	 	the	first	and	 on 	 ly 	 	state	to	 man 	 date 	 	that	women	 receiv 	 e 	 	 not 	 ification 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	breast	density	after	a	 mamm 	 ogram 	 	.
i	was	at	a	 con 	 ference 	 	of	60,000	people	in	breast	-	 im 	 aging 	 	last	week	in	chicago	,
and	i	was	 stunn 	 ed 	 	that	there	was	a	heated	debate	 a 	 s 	 	to	 whet 	 her 	 	we	should	be	 tell 	 ing 	 	women	what	 the 	 ir 	 	breast	density	is	.
of	course	we	should	.
and	if	you	do	n't	know	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	ask	your	doctor	or	read	the	 detail 	 s 	 	of	your	 mamm 	 ography 	 	report	.
second	,	if	you	're	pre	-	menopausal	,	try	to	schedule	your	 mamm 	 ogram 	 	in	the	first	two	 week 	 s 	 	of	your	 menstru 	 al 	 	cycle	,	when	breast	density	is	 relat 	 ively 	 	lower	.
third	,	if	you	notice	a	 persist 	 ent 	 	change	in	your	breast	,	insist	on	 add 	 ition 	 al 	 	 im 	 aging 	 	.
and	fourth	and	most	 import 	 ant 	 	,	the	 mamm 	 ography 	 	debate	will	rage	on	,	but	i	do	 believ 	 e 	 	that	all	women	40	and	 old 	 er 	 	should	have	an	annual	 mamm 	 ogram 	 	.
 mamm 	 ography 	 	is	n't	perfect	,	but	it	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	test	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	proven	to	 reduc 	 e 	 	 mortal 	 ity 	 	from	breast	cancer	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	 mortal 	 ity 	 	 bann 	 er 	 	is	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 word 	 	which	 mamm 	 ography 	 	's	most	 ard 	 ent 	 	 advoc 	 ates 	 	use	to	deter	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
some	women	who	develop	breast	cancer	die	from	it	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,
and	most	women	,	 thank 	 fully 	 	,	 surviv 	 e 	 	.
so	it	 take 	 s 	 	10	or	more	 year 	 s 	 	for	any	 screen 	 ing 	 	method	to	 demonst 	 rate 	 	a	 r 	 eduction 	 	in	 mortal 	 ity 	 	from	breast	cancer	.
 mamm 	 ography 	 	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	one	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	around	long	 en 	 ough 	 	to	have	a	chance	of	making	that	claim	.
it	is	time	for	us	to	accept	both	the	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 success 	 es 	 	of	 mamm 	 ography 	 	and	the	 limit 	 ations 	 	.
we	need	to	 individual 	 ize 	 	 screen 	 ing 	 	based	on	density	.
for	women	 with 	 out 	 	dense	 breast 	 s 	 	,	 mamm 	 ography 	 	is	the	best	choice	.
but	for	women	with	dense	 breast 	 s 	 	;	we	should	n't	abandon	 screen 	 ing 	 	 al 	 together 	 	,	we	need	to	 off 	 er 	 	them	 some 	 thing 	 	better	.
the	 bab 	 ies 	 	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 carry 	 ing 	 	when	my	patient	first	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	 th 	 is 	 	question	are	now	both	in	middle	school	,	and	the	answer	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	so	 s 	 low 	 	to	come	.
she	's	 give 	 n 	 	me	her	 bless 	 ing 	 	to	share	 th 	 is 	 	story	with	you	.
after	 under 	 going 	 	 bio 	 psies 	 	that	further	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	her	risk	for	cancer	and	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	her	sister	to	cancer	,	she	made	the	difficult	decision	to	have	a	prophylactic	 mast 	 ectomy 	 	.
we	can	and	must	do	better	,	not	just	in	time	for	her	 grand 	 daughter 	 s 	 	and	my	 daughter 	 s 	 	,	but	in	time	for	you	.
thank	you	.
