four	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	on	the	ted	stage	,	i	 announce 	 d 	 	a	company	i	was	 work 	 ing 	 	with	at	the	time	 call 	 ed 	 	odeo	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	of	that	 announce 	 ment 	 	,	we	got	a	big	article	in	the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	,	which	led	to	more	press	,	which	led	to	more	attention	,	and	me	 dec 	 id 	 ing 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	ceo	of	that	company	--	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	i	was	just	an	 advise 	 r 	 	--	and	raising	a	round	of	venture	capital	and	 ramp 	 ing 	 	up	 hir 	 ing 	 	.	one	of	the	 guy 	 s 	 	i	 hire 	 d 	 	was	an	engineer	named	jack	dorsey	,	and	a	year	 lat 	 er 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	decide	which	way	to	go	with	odeo	,	and	jack	 present 	 ed 	 	an	idea	he	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 tinker 	 ing 	 	around	with	for	a	number	of	 year 	 s 	 	that	was	based	around	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	simple	 stat 	 us 	 	 update 	 s 	 	to	 friend 	 s 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	with	sms	at	the	time	at	odeo	,	so	we	kind	of	put	two	and	two	together	,	and	in	early	2006	we	 launch 	 ed 	 	twitter	 a 	 s 	 	a	side	project	at	odeo	.
now	,	it	's	hard	to	 just 	 ify 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	a	side	project	at	a	 start 	 up 	 	,	where	focus	is	so	critical	,	but	i	had	 actual 	 ly 	 	 launch 	 ed 	 	blogger	 a 	 s 	 	a	side	project	to	my	previous	company	,	 think 	 ing 	 	it	was	just	a	little	thing	we	'd	do	on	the	side	,	and	it	 end 	 ed 	 	up	taking	over	not	 on 	 ly 	 	the	company	,	but	my	life	over	the	next	five	or	six	 year 	 s 	 	.
so	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	to	follow	 hunch 	 es 	 	even	 th 	 ough 	 	you	ca	n't	 necess 	 arily 	 	 just 	 ify 	 	them	or	know	where	they	're	going	to	go	.
and	that	's	kind	of	what	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	with	twitter	,	time	after	time	.
so	,	for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	 un 	 familiar 	 	,	twitter	is	based	around	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	,	 seem 	 ing 	 ly 	 	trivial	 con 	 cept 	 	.
you	say	what	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	in	140	 character 	 s 	 	or	less	,	and	people	who	are	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	you	get	 t 	 hose 	 	 update 	 s 	 	.
if	they	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	,	they	get	the	update	 a 	 s 	 	a	text	 mess 	 age 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	cell	phone	.
so	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	i	may	twitter	right	now	that	i	'm	giving	a	talk	at	ted	.
it	's	a	normal	 every 	 day 	 	thing	.
and	in	my	case	,	when	i	hit	 s 	 end 	 	,	up	to	60,000	people	will	 receiv 	 e 	 	that	 mess 	 age 	 	in	a	matter	of	 second 	 s 	 	.
now	,	the	fundamental	idea	is	that	twitter	lets	people	share	 moment 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	 when 	 ever 	 	they	want	,	be	they	 moment 	 ous 	 	 occasion 	 s 	 	or	mundane	 one 	 s 	 	.
it	is	by	sharing	these	 moment 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	're	 happen 	 ing 	 	that	lets	people	feel	more	 connect 	 ed 	 	and	in	touch	,	 de 	 spite 	 	distance	,	and	in	real	time	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	the	 prim 	 ary 	 	use	we	saw	for	twitter	from	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	and	what	got	us	 excit 	 ed 	 	.
what	we	did	n't	 anticip 	 ate 	 	was	the	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	other	uses	that	would	evolve	from	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	system	.	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	 real 	 ized 	 	was	how	 import 	 ant 	 	twitter	could	be	 dur 	 ing 	 	real	-	time	 event 	 s 	 	.
when	the	 wild 	 fire 	 s 	 	broke	out	in	san	diego	,	in	october	of	2007	,	people	 turn 	 ed 	 	to	twitter	to	report	what	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	and	to	find	information	from	 neighbor 	 s 	 	about	what	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	around	them	.
but	it	was	n't	just	 individual 	 s 	 	.
the	l.a.	 time 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	to	twitter	to	 dispens 	 e 	 	information	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	and	put	a	twitter	feed	on	the	front	page	,	and	the	l.a.	fire	 depart 	 ment 	 	and	red	cross	used	it	to	 dispens 	 e 	 	news	and	 update 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.	at	 th 	 is 	 	event	,	 dozen 	 s 	 	of	people	are	 t 	 wit 	 tering 	 	and	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	are	 follow 	 ing 	 	 a 	 long 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	want	to	know	what	it	 feel 	 s 	 	like	to	be	here	and	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	.	among	the	other	 interest 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	have	 crop 	 ped 	 	up	are	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	from	 business 	 es 	 	,	from	 market 	 ing 	 	and	 communication 	 s 	 	and	 predict 	 able 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	to	an	 insan 	 e 	 ly 	 	popular	korean	-	barbecue	 ta 	 co 	 	truck	that	 drive 	 s 	 	around	l.a.	and	twitters	where	it	 stop 	 s 	 	,	 caus 	 ing 	 	a	line	to	form	around	the	block	.	 politic 	 ians 	 	have	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 beg 	 un 	 	 t 	 wit 	 tering 	 	.	in	fact	,	there	are	47	 member 	 s 	 	of	congress	who	 current 	 ly 	 	have	twitter	 account 	 s 	 	.	and	they	're	 tweet 	 ing 	 	,	in	some	 case 	 s 	 	,	from	 be 	 hind 	 	closed	-	door	 session 	 s 	 	with	the	 p 	 resident 	 	.	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	 th 	 is 	 	guy	's	not	 lik 	 ing 	 	what	he	's	 hear 	 ing 	 	.
the	 p 	 resident 	 	 him 	 self 	 	is	our	most	popular	twitter	user	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	his	 tweet 	 s 	 	have	 drop 	 ped 	 	off	 a 	 s 	 	of	late	,	while	senator	mccain	's	have	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	.
 a 	 s 	 	have	 th 	 is 	 	guy	's	.
twitter	was	 original 	 ly 	 	designed	 a 	 s 	 	a	 broad 	 cast 	 	medium	:
you	 s 	 end 	 	one	 mess 	 age 	 	and	it	 go 	 es 	 	out	to	 every 	 body 	 	,	and	you	 receiv 	 e 	 	the	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	you	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	.
one	of	the	 man 	 y 	 	ways	that	 user 	 s 	 	shaped	the	evolution	of	twitter	was	by	 invent 	 ing 	 	a	way	to	 re 	 ply 	 	to	a	specific	person	or	a	specific	 mess 	 age 	 	.	so	,	 th 	 is 	 	 syn 	 tax 	 	,	the	``	@	 user 	 name 	 	``	that	shaquille	o'neal	's	using	here	to	 re 	 ply 	 	to	one	of	his	 fan 	 s 	 	,	was	 complete 	 ly 	 	 invent 	 ed 	 	by	 user 	 s 	 	,	and	we	did	n't	build	it	 in 	 to 	 	the	system	 un 	 til 	 	it	 al 	 ready 	 	 be 	 came 	 	popular	and	then	we	made	it	 eas 	 ier 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	 man 	 y 	 	ways	that	 user 	 s 	 	have	shaped	the	system	.
 an 	 other 	 	is	via	the	api	.
we	built	an	application	-	 programm 	 ing 	 	 inter 	 face 	 	,	which	 bas 	 ically 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	 programm 	 ers 	 	can	write	 soft 	 ware 	 	that	 interact 	 s 	 	with	twitter	.
we	 current 	 ly 	 	know	about	over	2,000	 piece 	 s 	 	of	 soft 	 ware 	 	that	can	 s 	 end 	 	twitter	 update 	 s 	 	--	 inter 	 face 	 s 	 	for	mac	,	 window 	 s 	 	,	your	iphone	,	your	 black 	 berry 	 	--
 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	a	 de 	 vice 	 	that	lets	an	 un 	 born 	 	baby	twitter	when	it	 kick 	 s 	 	or	a	plant	twitter	when	it	 need 	 s 	 	water	.	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	third	-	party	 develop 	 ment 	 	came	from	a	little	company	in	virginia	 call 	 ed 	 	summize	.	summize	built	a	twitter	search	engine	.	and	they	 ta 	 pped 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	fact	that	,	if	you	have	 million 	 s 	 	of	people	around	the	world	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	and	what	's	around	them	,	you	have	an	 in 	 credible 	 	resource	to	find	out	about	any	 top 	 ic 	 	or	event	while	it	's	going	on	.	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 change 	 d 	 	how	we	 perceive 	 d 	 	twitter	.	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	here	's	what	people	are	 say 	 ing 	 	about	ted	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	way	that	our	mind	was	 shift 	 ed 	 	,	and	twitter	was	n't	what	we	thought	it	was	.	we	 like 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	so	much	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 b 	 ought 	 	the	company	and	are	 fold 	 ing 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	the	main	product	.	 th 	 is 	 	not	 on 	 ly 	 	lets	you	view	twitters	in	different	ways	,	but	it	 introduc 	 es 	 	new	use	 case 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
one	of	my	 favor 	 ites 	 	is	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	ago	when	there	was	a	gas	 short 	 age 	 	in	atlanta	.	some	 user 	 s 	 	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	that	they	would	twitter	when	they	found	gas	--	where	it	was	,	and	how	much	it	cost	--	and	then	 append 	 ed 	 	the	 key 	 word 	 	``	#	 atl 	 gas 	 	``	so	that	other	people	search	for	that	and	find	gas	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	trend	of	people	using	 th 	 is 	 	communication	network	to	help	each	other	out	 go 	 es 	 	far	beyond	the	original	idea	of	just	 keep 	 ing 	 	up	with	family	and	 friend 	 s 	 	.	it	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	more	and	more	 late 	 ly 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	raising	money	for	 home 	 less 	 	people	or	to	dig	 well 	 s 	 	in	africa	or	for	a	family	in	crisis	.	people	have	raised	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	over	twitter	in	a	matter	of	 day 	 s 	 	on	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 occasion 	 s 	 	.	it	 seem 	 s 	 	like	when	you	give	people	 eas 	 ier 	 	ways	to	share	information	,	more	good	 thing 	 s 	 	happen	.	i	have	no	idea	what	will	happen	next	with	twitter	.
i	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	to	follow	the	hunch	,	but	never	 assum 	 e 	 	where	it	will	go	.	 thank 	 s 	 	.
chris	anderson	:	we	're	not	 quit 	 e 	 	 d 	 one 	 	yet	.
so	,	look	,	if	we	could	have	 th 	 is 	 	screen	live	...
 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	most	 terrify 	 ing 	 	thing	that	any	speaker	can	do	after	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	to	an	event	.	it	's	 total 	 ly 	 	 intimid 	 ating 	 	.
