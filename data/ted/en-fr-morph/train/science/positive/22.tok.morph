 he 	 y 	 	,	i	am	michael	shermer	,	the	director	of	the	 skeptic 	 s 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	the	 publish 	 er 	 	of	``	skeptic	``	magazine	.
we	investigate	 claim 	 s 	 	of	the	 para 	 normal 	 	,	pseudo	-	science	,	and	fringe	 group 	 s 	 	and	 cult 	 s 	 	and	 claim 	 s 	 	of	all	 kind 	 s 	 	between	--	science	and	pseudo	-	science	and	non	-	science	and	junk	science	,	voodoo	science	,	 patho 	 logical 	 	science	,	bad	science	,	non	-	science	and	plain	old	 non 	 sense 	 	.
and	 un 	 less 	 	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	on	mars	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	you	know	there	's	a	lot	of	that	out	there	.
some	people	call	us	 debunk 	 ers 	 	,	which	is	kind	of	a	negative	term	.
but	let	's	face	it	--	there	's	a	lot	of	bunk	,	and	we	are	like	the	 bunk 	 o 	 	 s 	 quad 	 s 	 	of	the	police	 depart 	 ments 	 	out	there	,	 flush 	 ing 	 	out	.
well	,	we	're	sort	of	like	the	ralph	naders	of	bad	 idea 	 s 	 	--	 try 	 ing 	 	to	replace	bad	 idea 	 s 	 	with	good	 idea 	 s 	 	.
i	'll	show	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	a	bad	idea	.
i	 br 	 ought 	 	 th 	 is 	 	with	me	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	 give 	 n 	 	to	us	by	nbc	dateline	to	test	.
it	's	the	--	it	's	 produce 	 d 	 	by	the	quadro	corporation	of	west	virginia	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	quadro	2000	dowser	rod	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 old 	 	to	high	school	 administr 	 ators 	 	for	900	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	piece	.
it	's	a	piece	of	plastic	with	a	radio	 s 	 hack 	 	antenna	 attach 	 ed 	 	to	it	.
you	could	dowse	for	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	one	was	built	to	dowse	for	 mar 	 ijuana 	 	in	 student 	 s 	 	'	 lock 	 ers 	 	.
so	the	way	it	 work 	 s 	 	is	,	you	go	down	the	 hall 	 way 	 	and	you	see	if	it	 tilt 	 s 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	a	 part 	 icular 	 	 lock 	 er 	 	,	and	then	you	open	the	 lock 	 er 	 	.
so	it	 look 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	'll	show	you	.
no	,	it	--	well	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	kind	of	a	right	-	 lean 	 ing 	 	bias	.
so	,	i	'll	show	--	well	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	science	,	so	we	'll	do	a	controlled	experiment	.
it	'll	go	 th 	 is 	 	way	for	 s 	 ure 	 	.
 s 	 ir 	 	,	you	want	to	empty	your	 pocket 	 s 	 	.	 pleas 	 e 	 	,	 s 	 ir 	 	?
so	the	question	was	,	can	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	find	 mar 	 ijuana 	 	in	 student 	 s 	 	'	 lock 	 ers 	 	?
and	the	answer	is	,	if	you	open	 en 	 ough 	 	of	them	,	 y 	 es 	 	.
but	in	science	,	we	have	to	keep	track	of	the	 mis 	 s 	 es 	 	,	not	just	the	 hit 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	key	 less 	 on 	 	to	my	short	talk	here	,	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	 psych 	 ic 	 s 	 	work	,	 astrologer 	 s 	 	,	and	 ta 	 rot 	 	card	 read 	 ers 	 	and	so	on	.
people	remember	the	 hit 	 s 	 	;	they	forget	the	 mis 	 s 	 es 	 	.
in	science	we	have	to	keep	the	whole	 data 	 base 	 	,	and	look	to	see	if	the	number	of	 hit 	 s 	 	 some 	 how 	 	 stand 	 s 	 	out	from	the	total	number	that	you	would	expect	by	chance	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	we	tested	it	.
we	had	two	 opa 	 que 	 	boxes	:	one	with	government	-	approved	thc	 mar 	 ijuana 	 	,	and	one	with	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
and	it	got	it	50	percent	of	the	time	--
which	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	you	'd	expect	with	a	 co 	 in 	 	flip	model	.
so	that	's	just	a	 f 	 un 	 	little	 ex 	 ample 	 	here	of	the	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	we	do	.
``	skeptic	``	is	the	 quarter 	 ly 	 	 public 	 ation 	 	.
each	one	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 part 	 icular 	 	theme	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	one	is	on	the	future	of	 intellig 	 ence 	 	.
are	people	 get 	 ting 	 	 smart 	 er 	 	or	 dumb 	 er 	 	?
i	have	an	opinion	of	 th 	 is 	 	 my 	 self 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	business	i	'm	in	,
but	,	in	fact	,	people	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	are	 get 	 ting 	 	 smart 	 er 	 	.
three	iq	 point 	 s 	 	per	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	going	up	.
sort	of	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	.
with	science	,	do	n't	think	of	 skeptic 	 ism 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	thing	or	even	science	 a 	 s 	 	a	thing	.
are	science	and	 relig 	 ion 	 	compatible	?
it	's	like	,	are	science	and	 plumb 	 ing 	 	compatible	?
these	--	they	're	just	two	different	 thing 	 s 	 	.
science	is	not	a	thing	.	it	's	a	verb	.
it	's	a	way	of	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 thing 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	way	of	looking	for	natural	 explan 	 ations 	 	for	all	 phenomen 	 a 	 	.
i	mean	,	what	's	more	 like 	 ly 	 	:	that	 extra 	 terrestrial 	 	 intellig 	 ence 	 s 	 	or	multi	-	dimensional	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	travel	 a 	 cross 	 	the	vast	 distance 	 s 	 	of	 inter 	 stellar 	 	space	to	 leav 	 e 	 	a	crop	circle	in	 farm 	 er 	 	bob	's	field	in	puckerbrush	,	kansas	to	promote	 skeptic 	 .com 	 	,	our	 web 	 page 	 	?
or	is	it	more	 like 	 ly 	 	that	a	 read 	 er 	 	of	``	skeptic	``	did	 th 	 is 	 	with	photoshop	?
and	in	all	 case 	 s 	 	we	have	to	ask	--	what	's	the	more	 like 	 ly 	 	 explan 	 ation 	 	?
and	before	we	say	 some 	 thing 	 	is	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	world	,	we	should	first	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	it	's	not	in	 th 	 is 	 	world	.
what	's	more	 like 	 ly 	 	--	that	arnold	had	a	little	 extra 	 terrestrial 	 	help	in	his	run	for	the	 govern 	 or 	 ship 	 	?
or	that	the	``	world	 week 	 ly 	 	news	``	 make 	 s 	 	stuff	up	?
and	part	of	that	--	the	same	theme	is	 express 	 ed 	 	 nice 	 ly 	 	here	in	 th 	 is 	 	sidney	harris	cartoon	.
for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	in	the	back	,	it	 say 	 s 	 	here	:	``	then	a	miracle	 occur 	 s 	 	.
i	think	you	need	to	be	more	 ex 	 plicit 	 	here	in	step	two	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	single	slide	 complete 	 ly 	 	 dismantle 	 s 	 	the	intelligent	design	 argument 	 s 	 	.
there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	more	to	it	than	that	.
you	can	say	a	miracle	 occur 	 s 	 	.
it	's	just	that	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	explain	 any 	 thing 	 	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 off 	 er 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	.	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	test	.
it	's	the	end	of	the	conversation	for	intelligent	design	 creation 	 ists 	 	.
 where 	 a 	 s 	 	--	and	it	's	true	,	 scientist 	 s 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	throw	 term 	 s 	 	out	 a 	 s 	 	 linguist 	 ic 	 	place	 fill 	 ers 	 	--	dark	energy	or	dark	matter	or	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	--
 un 	 til 	 	we	figure	out	what	it	is	,	we	'll	just	call	it	 th 	 is 	 	--
it	's	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	 caus 	 al 	 	chain	for	science	.
for	intelligent	design	 creation 	 ists 	 	,	it	's	the	end	of	the	chain	.
so	 aga 	 in 	 	,	we	can	ask	 th 	 is 	 	:	what	's	more	 like 	 ly 	 	?	are	ufos	alien	 space 	 ship 	 s 	 	or	 per 	 cept 	 ual 	 	cognitive	 mistak 	 es 	 	--	or	even	 fake 	 s 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	ufo	shot	from	my	house	in	altadena	,	california	,	looking	down	over	pasadena	.
and	if	it	 look 	 s 	 	a	lot	like	a	buick	 hub 	 cap 	 	,	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	.
you	do	n't	even	need	photoshop	;	you	do	n't	need	high	-	tech	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	;	you	do	n't	need	 computer 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	shot	with	a	 throw 	 away 	 	kodak	instamatic	camera	.
you	just	have	 some 	 body 	 	off	on	the	side	with	a	 hub 	 cap 	 	ready	to	go	.
camera	's	ready	--	that	's	it	.
so	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	it	's	possible	that	most	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	fake	or	 illusion 	 s 	 	or	so	on	and	that	some	of	them	are	real	,	it	's	more	 like 	 ly 	 	that	all	of	them	are	fake	,	like	the	crop	 circle 	 s 	 	.
on	a	more	serious	note	,	in	all	of	science	we	're	looking	for	a	balance	between	data	and	 theor 	 y 	 	.
in	the	case	of	galileo	,	he	had	two	 problem 	 s 	 	when	he	 turn 	 ed 	 	his	 tele 	 scope 	 	to	saturn	.
first	of	all	,	there	was	no	 theor 	 y 	 	of	planetary	 ring 	 s 	 	.
and	second	of	all	,	his	data	was	 grain 	 y 	 	and	 fuzz 	 y 	 	,	and	he	could	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	make	out	what	it	was	he	was	looking	at	.
so	he	wrote	that	he	had	 s 	 een 	 	--	``	i	have	 observ 	 ed 	 	that	the	 fur 	 th 	 est 	 	planet	 ha 	 s 	 	three	bodies	.	``
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	he	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 con 	 clud 	 ing 	 	that	he	saw	.
so	 with 	 out 	 	a	 theor 	 y 	 	of	planetary	 ring 	 s 	 	and	with	 on 	 ly 	 	 grain 	 y 	 	data	,	you	ca	n't	have	a	good	 theor 	 y 	 	.
and	it	was	n't	 solve 	 d 	 	 un 	 til 	 	1655	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	christiaan	huygens	's	book	in	which	he	 catalog 	 ed 	 	all	the	 mistak 	 es 	 	that	people	made	in	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	what	was	going	on	with	saturn	.
it	was	n't	till	--	huygens	had	two	 thing 	 s 	 	.
he	had	a	good	 theor 	 y 	 	of	planetary	 ring 	 s 	 	and	how	the	solar	system	 oper 	 ated 	 	.
and	then	,	he	had	better	 tele 	 scopic 	 	,	more	fine	-	grain	data	in	which	he	could	figure	out	that	 a 	 s 	 	the	earth	is	going	around	 fast 	 er 	 	--	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	kepler	's	 law 	 s 	 	--	than	saturn	,	then	we	catch	up	with	it	.
and	we	see	the	 angle 	 s 	 	of	the	 ring 	 s 	 	at	different	 angle 	 s 	 	,	there	.
and	that	,	in	fact	,	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	be	true	.
the	 problem 	 s 	 	with	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	 theor 	 y 	 	is	that	your	 theor 	 y 	 	may	be	 load 	 ed 	 	with	cognitive	 bias 	 es 	 	.	so	one	of	the	 problem 	 s 	 	of	 explain 	 ing 	 	why	people	 believ 	 e 	 	weird	 thing 	 s 	 	is	that	we	have	 thing 	 s 	 	on	a	simple	level	.
and	then	i	'll	go	to	more	serious	 one 	 s 	 	.
like	,	we	have	a	 tend 	 ency 	 	to	see	 face 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	face	on	mars	,	which	was	--	in	1976	,	where	there	was	a	whole	 move 	 ment 	 	to	get	nasa	to	photograph	that	area	 be 	 cause 	 	people	thought	 th 	 is 	 	was	 monument 	 al 	 	 architect 	 ure 	 	made	by	martians	.
well	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	--	here	's	the	close	-	up	of	it	from	2001	.
if	you	 s 	 quint 	 	,	you	can	still	see	the	face	.
and	when	you	're	 s 	 quint 	 ing 	 	,	what	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	is	you	're	 turn 	 ing 	 	that	from	fine	-	grain	to	coarse	-	grain	.
and	so	,	you	're	 reduc 	 ing 	 	the	quality	of	your	data	.
and	if	i	did	n't	tell	you	what	to	look	for	,	you	'd	still	see	the	face	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	 programm 	 ed 	 	by	evolution	to	see	 face 	 s 	 	.
 face 	 s 	 	are	 import 	 ant 	 	for	us	 social 	 ly 	 	.
and	,	of	course	,	happy	 face 	 s 	 	.
 face 	 s 	 	of	all	 kind 	 s 	 	are	easy	to	see	.
you	can	see	the	happy	face	on	mars	,	there	.

here	's	the	virgin	mary	on	the	side	of	a	glass	window	in	sao	paulo	.
now	,	here	's	the	virgin	mary	made	her	 appear 	 ance 	 	on	a	cheese	sandwich	--	which	i	got	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	hold	in	a	las	vegas	casino	,	of	course	,	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	america	.
 th 	 is 	 	casino	paid	28,500	 dollar 	 s 	 	on	ebay	for	the	cheese	sandwich	.
but	who	 do 	 es 	 	it	 re 	 ally 	 	look	like	,	the	virgin	mary	?
it	 ha 	 s 	 	that	sort	of	 puck 	 er 	 ed 	 	lips	,	1940s	-	era	look	.
virgin	mary	in	clearwater	,	florida	.
i	 actual 	 ly 	 	went	to	see	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
there	was	a	lot	of	people	there	--	the	 faith 	 ful 	 	come	to	be	in	 the 	 ir 	 	--	 wheelchair 	 s 	 	and	 crutch 	 es 	 	,	and	so	on	.
and	we	went	down	,	 investigate 	 d 	 	.
just	to	give	you	a	 s 	 ize 	 	--	that	's	dawkins	,	me	and	the	 amaz 	 ing 	 	randi	,	next	to	 th 	 is 	 	two	,	two	and	a	half	story	 s 	 ize 	 	image	.

so	we	 walk 	 ed 	 	around	the	 back 	 side 	 	,	just	to	see	what	was	going	on	here	,	where	--	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	 where 	 ver 	 	there	's	a	 sprinkl 	 er 	 	head	and	a	palm	tree	,	you	get	the	effect	.

i	guess	you	can	 on 	 ly 	 	have	one	miracle	per	building	.
so	is	it	 re 	 ally 	 	a	miracle	of	mary	,	or	is	it	a	miracle	of	marge	?
and	then	i	'm	going	to	finish	up	with	 an 	 other 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	with	audio	--	 audit 	 ory 	 	 illusion 	 s 	 	.
there	is	 th 	 is 	 	film	,	``	white	noise	,	``	with	michael	keaton	about	the	dead	 talk 	 ing 	 	back	to	us	.

all	right	,	i	'm	going	to	just	end	with	a	positive	,	nice	,	little	story	about	--	the	 skeptic 	 s 	 	is	a	 non 	 profit 	 	 education 	 al 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	.

but	my	friend	,	simon	singh	,	the	particle	physicist	now	 turn 	 ed 	 	science	 educ 	 ator 	 	,	and	he	wrote	the	book	``	the	big	bang	,	``	and	so	on	.
he	uses	every	chance	he	 get 	 s 	 	to	promote	good	science	.
and	so	,	he	wrote	an	op	-	ed	piece	in	``	the	 guard 	 ian 	 	``	about	katie	's	song	,	in	which	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	well	,	we	know	 exact 	 ly 	 	how	old	,	how	far	from	the	edge	.
