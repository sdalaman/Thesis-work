 jam 	 bo 	 	,	 bon 	 jou 	 r 	 	,	zdravstvujtye	,	 day 	 o 	 	:	these	are	a	few	of	the	 language 	 s 	 	that	i	've	spoken	little	bits	of	over	the	course	of	the	last	six	 week 	 s 	 	,
 a 	 s 	 	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	to	17	 count 	 ries 	 	i	think	i	'm	up	to	,	on	 th 	 is 	 	crazy	tour	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	,	 check 	 ing 	 	out	 vari 	 ous 	 	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	of	the	project	that	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	.	and	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	a	little	bit	about	 lat 	 er 	 	on	.
and	 visit 	 ing 	 	some	 pre 	 tty 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	 place 	 s 	 	,
 place 	 s 	 	like	mongolia	,	cambodia	,	new	guinea	,	south	africa	,	tanzania	twice	--	i	was	here	a	month	ago	.
and	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	make	a	 whirl 	 wind 	 	tour	of	the	world	like	that	is	 utter 	 ly 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	,	for	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 reason 	 s 	 	.
you	see	some	 in 	 credible 	 	stuff	.
and	you	get	to	make	these	spot	 compar 	 ison 	 s 	 	between	people	all	around	the	 glob 	 e 	 	.
and	the	thing	that	you	 re 	 ally 	 	take	away	from	that	,	the	kind	of	surface	thing	that	you	take	away	from	it	,	is	not	that	we	're	all	one	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	about	that	,	but	 ra 	 ther 	 	how	different	we	are	.
there	is	so	much	 divers 	 ity 	 	around	the	 glob 	 e 	 	.
6,000	different	 language 	 s 	 	spoken	by	six	and	a	half	billion	people	,	all	different	 color 	 s 	 	,	 shape 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 ize 	 s 	 	.
you	walk	down	the	street	in	any	big	city	,	you	travel	like	that	,	and	you	are	 amaz 	 ed 	 	at	the	 divers 	 ity 	 	in	the	human	species	.
how	do	we	explain	that	 divers 	 ity 	 	?
well	,	that	's	what	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	 to 	 day 	 	,	is	how	we	're	using	the	 tool 	 s 	 	of	 genetic 	 s 	 	,	population	 genetic 	 s 	 	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	to	tell	us	how	we	generated	 th 	 is 	 	 divers 	 ity 	 	,	and	how	long	it	took	.
now	,	the	problem	of	human	 divers 	 ity 	 	,	like	all	big	scientific	 question 	 s 	 	--	how	do	you	explain	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	--	can	be	broken	down	 in 	 to 	 	sub	-	 question 	 s 	 	.
and	you	can	ferret	away	at	 t 	 hose 	 	little	sub	-	 question 	 s 	 	.
first	one	is	 re 	 ally 	 	a	question	of	 origin 	 s 	 	.
do	we	all	share	a	common	origin	,	in	fact	?
and	 give 	 n 	 	that	we	do	--	and	that	's	the	assumption	 every 	 body 	 	,	i	think	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	would	make	--	when	was	that	?
when	did	we	 origin 	 ate 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	species	?
how	long	have	we	 be 	 en 	 	 diverge 	 nt 	 	from	each	other	?
and	the	second	question	is	related	,	but	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	different	.
if	we	do	spring	from	a	common	source	,	how	did	we	come	to	occupy	every	corner	of	the	 glob 	 e 	 	,	and	in	the	process	generate	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	 divers 	 ity 	 	,	the	different	ways	of	life	,	the	different	 appear 	 ance 	 s 	 	,	the	different	 language 	 s 	 	around	the	world	?
well	,	the	question	of	 origin 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	with	so	 man 	 y 	 	other	 question 	 s 	 	in	biology	,	 seem 	 s 	 	to	have	 be 	 en 	 	 answer 	 ed 	 	by	darwin	over	a	century	ago	.
in	``	the	 d 	 escent 	 	of	man	,	``	he	wrote	,	``	in	each	great	region	of	the	world	,	the	living	 mammal 	 s 	 	are	 close 	 ly 	 	related	to	the	extinct	species	of	the	same	region	.
it	's	 there 	 fore 	 	 prob 	 able 	 	that	africa	was	 form 	 er 	 ly 	 	 inhabit 	 ed 	 	by	extinct	 ape 	 s 	 	 close 	 ly 	 	 all 	 ied 	 	to	the	gorilla	and	chimpanzee	,
and	 a 	 s 	 	these	two	species	are	now	man	's	 near 	 est 	 	 al 	 lies 	 	,	it	's	 some 	 what 	 	more	 prob 	 able 	 	that	our	early	 progenitor 	 s 	 	lived	on	the	african	continent	than	 else 	 where 	 	.	``
so	we	're	 d 	 one 	 	,	we	can	go	home	--	 finish 	 ed 	 	the	origin	question	.
well	,	not	 quit 	 e 	 	.	 be 	 cause 	 	darwin	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	our	 di 	 stant 	 	 ance 	 stry 	 	,	our	common	 ance 	 stry 	 	with	 ape 	 s 	 	.
and	it	is	 quit 	 e 	 	clear	that	 ape 	 s 	 	 origin 	 ated 	 	on	the	african	continent	.
around	23	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	they	appear	in	the	fossil	record	.
africa	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 dis 	 connect 	 ed 	 	from	the	other	 land 	 masse 	 s 	 	at	that	time	,	due	to	the	 vag 	 aries 	 	of	plate	 tectonic 	 s 	 	,	 float 	 ing 	 	around	the	indian	ocean	.
 bump 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	eurasia	around	16	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	then	we	had	the	first	african	 exo 	 du 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	call	it	.
the	 ape 	 s 	 	that	left	at	that	time	 end 	 ed 	 	up	in	 south 	 east 	 	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	,	 be 	 came 	 	the	 gib 	 bon 	 s 	 	and	the	 orangutan 	 s 	 	.
and	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	 stay 	 ed 	 	on	in	africa	 evolv 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 gorilla 	 s 	 	,	the	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	and	us	.
so	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	if	you	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	our	common	 ance 	 stry 	 	with	 ape 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	,	by	looking	at	the	fossil	record	,	we	 start 	 ed 	 	off	here	.
but	that	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	the	question	i	'm	 ask 	 ing 	 	.
i	'm	 ask 	 ing 	 	about	our	human	 ance 	 stry 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	would	 recogn 	 ize 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	like	us	if	they	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	here	in	the	room	.
if	they	 we 	 re 	 	 peer 	 ing 	 	over	your	shoulder	,	you	would	n't	leap	back	,	like	that	.	what	about	our	human	 ance 	 stry 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	if	we	go	far	 en 	 ough 	 	back	,	we	share	a	common	 ance 	 stry 	 	with	every	living	thing	on	earth	.
dna	ties	us	all	together	,	so	we	share	 ance 	 stry 	 	with	 bar 	 racuda 	 	and	bacteria	and	 mushroom 	 s 	 	,	if	you	go	far	 en 	 ough 	 	back	--	over	a	billion	 year 	 s 	 	.
what	we	're	 ask 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 ough 	 	is	human	 ance 	 stry 	 	.
how	do	we	 stud 	 y 	 	that	?
well	,	 historic 	 ally 	 	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 stud 	 ied 	 	using	the	science	of	 paleo 	 anthropo 	 logy 	 	.	 dig 	 ging 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	up	out	of	the	ground	,	and	 large 	 ly 	 	on	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	 morpho 	 logy 	 	--	the	way	 thing 	 s 	 	are	shaped	,	often	skull	shape	--	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	 look 	 s 	 	a	little	bit	more	like	us	than	that	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	must	be	my	 ance 	 s 	 tor 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	must	be	who	i	'm	 direct 	 ly 	 	 descend 	 ed 	 	from	.	``
the	field	of	 paleo 	 anthropo 	 logy 	 	,	i	'll	 argu 	 e 	 	,	 give 	 s 	 	us	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 fasci 	 nating 	 	 possibil 	 ities 	 	about	our	 ance 	 stry 	 	,	but	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	give	us	the	 prob 	 abilities 	 	that	we	 re 	 ally 	 	want	 a 	 s 	 	 scientist 	 s 	 	.
what	do	i	mean	by	that	?
you	're	looking	at	a	great	 ex 	 ample 	 	here	.
these	are	three	extinct	species	of	 hominid 	 s 	 	,	potential	human	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	.
all	 d 	 ug 	 	up	just	west	of	here	in	olduvai	gorge	,	by	the	leakey	family	.
and	they	're	all	 d 	 ating 	 	to	 rough 	 ly 	 	the	same	time	.
from	left	to	right	,	we	've	got	homo	 erect 	 us 	 	,	homo	 hab 	 ili 	 s 	 	,	and	australopithecus	--	now	 call 	 ed 	 	paranthropus	boisei	,	the	 ro 	 bust 	 	 australopithec 	 ine 	 	.	three	extinct	species	,	same	place	,	same	time	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	not	all	three	could	be	my	direct	 ance 	 s 	 tor 	 	.
which	one	of	these	 guy 	 s 	 	am	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	related	to	?
 possibil 	 ities 	 	about	our	 ance 	 stry 	 	,	but	not	the	 prob 	 abilities 	 	that	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	looking	for	.
well	,	a	different	approach	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	to	look	at	 morpho 	 logy 	 	in	 human 	 s 	 	using	the	 on 	 ly 	 	data	that	people	 re 	 ally 	 	had	at	hand	 un 	 til 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	--	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 large 	 ly 	 	skull	shape	.
the	first	person	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	 system 	 at 	 ically 	 	was	linnaeus	,	carl	von	linne	,	a	swedish	botanist	,	who	in	the	 eight 	 een 	 th 	 	century	took	it	 up 	 on 	 	 him 	 self 	 	to	 categor 	 ize 	 	every	living	organism	on	the	planet	.
you	think	you	've	got	a	tough	job	?
and	he	did	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	job	.
he	 categor 	 ized 	 	about	12,000	species	in	``	systema	naturae	.	``
he	 actual 	 ly 	 	 co 	 in 	 ed 	 	the	term	homo	 sapien 	 s 	 	--	it	 mean 	 s 	 	wise	man	in	latin	.
but	looking	around	the	world	at	the	 divers 	 ity 	 	of	 human 	 s 	 	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	you	know	,	we	seem	to	come	in	discreet	sub	-	species	or	 categor 	 ies 	 	.	``
and	he	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	africans	and	americans	and	asians	and	europeans	,	and	a	 blatant 	 ly 	 	racist	 categor 	 y 	 	he	 term 	 ed 	 	``	monstrosus	,	``	which	 bas 	 ically 	 	 include 	 d 	 	all	the	people	he	did	n't	like	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 imagin 	 ary 	 	folk	like	elves	.
it	's	easy	to	dismiss	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	well	-	intentioned	but	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	 be 	 night 	 ed 	 	 mus 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	an	 eight 	 een 	 th 	 	century	scientist	 work 	 ing 	 	in	the	pre	-	darwinian	era	.
 ex 	 cept 	 	,	if	you	had	taken	physical	 anthropo 	 logy 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	20	or	30	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	in	 man 	 y 	 	 case 	 s 	 	you	would	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	that	same	 class 	 ification 	 	of	 human 	 ity 	 	.
human	 race 	 s 	 	that	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	physical	 anthropo 	 logists 	 	of	30	,	40	 year 	 s 	 	ago	--	carlton	coon	is	the	best	 ex 	 ample 	 	--	had	 be 	 en 	 	 div 	 er 	 ging 	 	from	each	other	--	 th 	 is 	 	was	in	the	post	-	darwinian	era	--	for	over	a	million	 year 	 s 	 	,	since	the	time	of	homo	 erect 	 us 	 	.
but	based	on	what	data	?
 ver 	 y 	 	little	.	 ver 	 y 	 	little	.	 morpho 	 logy 	 	and	a	lot	of	 guess 	 work 	 	.
well	,	what	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	 to 	 day 	 	,	what	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	now	is	a	new	approach	to	 th 	 is 	 	problem	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	going	out	and	 guess 	 ing 	 	about	our	 ance 	 stry 	 	,	 dig 	 ging 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	up	out	of	the	ground	,	possible	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	,	and	 say 	 ing 	 	it	on	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	 morpho 	 logy 	 	--	which	we	still	do	n't	 complete 	 ly 	 	understand	,
we	do	n't	know	the	genetic	 cause 	 s 	 	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 morpho 	 logical 	 	 vari 	 ation 	 	--
what	we	need	to	do	is	turn	the	problem	on	 it 	 s 	 	head	.
 be 	 cause 	 	what	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	is	a	 genea 	 logical 	 	problem	,
or	a	 genea 	 logical 	 	question	.
what	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	is	construct	a	family	tree	for	 every 	 body 	 	 al 	 ive 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	any	 genea 	 logist 	 	will	tell	you	--	 any 	 body 	 	have	a	member	of	the	family	,	or	 may 	 be 	 	you	have	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	construct	a	family	tree	,	trace	back	in	time	?
you	start	in	the	present	,	with	 relationship 	 s 	 	you	're	certain	about	.
you	and	your	 s 	 i 	 bling 	 s 	 	,	you	have	a	parent	in	common	.
you	and	your	 cousin 	 s 	 	share	a	 grand 	 parent 	 	in	common	.
you	 gradu 	 ally 	 	trace	further	and	further	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	past	,	 add 	 ing 	 	these	ever	more	 di 	 stant 	 	 relationship 	 s 	 	.
but	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	no	matter	how	good	you	are	at	 dig 	 ging 	 	up	the	church	 record 	 s 	 	,	and	all	that	stuff	,	you	hit	what	the	 genea 	 logists 	 	call	a	brick	wall	.
a	point	beyond	which	you	do	n't	know	 any 	 thing 	 	else	about	your	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	,	and	you	enter	 th 	 is 	 	dark	and	 myster 	 ious 	 	realm	we	call	 histo 	 ry 	 	that	we	have	to	feel	our	way	through	with	 whisper 	 ed 	 	 gui 	 dance 	 	.
who	 we 	 re 	 	these	people	who	came	before	?
we	have	no	written	record	.	well	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	we	do	.
written	in	our	dna	,	in	our	genetic	code	--
we	have	a	 historic 	 al 	 	document	that	 take 	 s 	 	us	back	in	time	to	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 ear 	 liest 	 	 day 	 s 	 	of	our	species	.	and	that	's	what	we	 stud 	 y 	 	.
now	,	a	quick	 prim 	 er 	 	on	dna	.
i	suspect	that	not	 every 	 body 	 	in	the	audience	is	a	 genetic 	 ist 	 	.
it	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	long	,	linear	molecule	,	a	 cod 	 ed 	 	version	of	how	to	make	 an 	 other 	 	copy	of	you	.	it	's	your	 blue 	 print 	 	.
it	's	 compose 	 d 	 	of	four	 sub 	 unit 	 s 	 	:	a	,	c	,	g	and	t	,	we	call	them	.
and	it	's	the	sequence	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 sub 	 unit 	 s 	 	that	 define 	 s 	 	that	 blue 	 print 	 	.
how	long	is	it	?	well	,	it	's	 billion 	 s 	 	of	these	 sub 	 unit 	 s 	 	in	length	.
a	 hap 	 l 	 oid 	 	genome	--	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	two	copies	of	all	of	our	 chromosom 	 es 	 	--
a	 hap 	 l 	 oid 	 	genome	is	around	3.2	billion	 nucleotide 	 s 	 	in	length	.
and	the	whole	thing	,	if	you	add	it	all	together	,	is	over	six	billion	 nucleotide 	 s 	 	long	.
if	you	take	all	the	dna	out	of	one	cell	in	your	body	,	and	stretch	it	end	to	end	,	it	's	around	two	 meter 	 s 	 	long	.
if	you	take	all	the	dna	out	of	every	cell	in	your	body	,	and	you	stretch	it	end	to	end	,	it	would	reach	from	here	to	the	moon	and	back	,	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 time 	 s 	 	.	it	's	a	lot	of	information	.
and	so	when	you	're	 copy 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	dna	molecule	to	pass	it	on	,	it	's	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	tough	job	.
imagine	the	 long 	 est 	 	book	you	can	think	of	,	``	war	and	peace	.	``
now	 multi 	 ply 	 	it	by	100	.
and	imagine	 copy 	 ing 	 	that	by	hand	.
and	you	're	 work 	 ing 	 	away	 un 	 til 	 	late	at	night	,	and	you	're	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 care 	 ful 	 	,	and	you	're	 drink 	 ing 	 	coffee	and	you	're	 pay 	 ing 	 	attention	,	but	,	 occasion 	 ally 	 	,	when	you	're	 copy 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	by	hand	,	you	're	going	to	make	a	little	typo	,	a	 spell 	 ing 	 	 mistak 	 e 	 	--
 substitut 	 e 	 	an	i	for	an	e	,	or	a	c	for	a	t	.
same	thing	 happen 	 s 	 	to	our	dna	 a 	 s 	 	it	's	 be 	 ing 	 	 pass 	 ed 	 	on	through	the	 generation 	 s 	 	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	happen	 ver 	 y 	 	often	.	we	have	a	 proof 	 read 	 ing 	 	 mechan 	 ism 	 	built	in	.
but	when	it	 do 	 es 	 	happen	,	and	these	 change 	 s 	 	get	 transmit 	 ted 	 	down	through	the	 generation 	 s 	 	,	they	 be 	 come 	 	 marker 	 s 	 	of	 d 	 escent 	 	.
if	you	share	a	marker	with	 some 	 one 	 	,	it	 mean 	 s 	 	you	share	an	 ance 	 s 	 tor 	 	at	some	point	in	the	past	,
the	person	who	first	had	that	change	in	 the 	 ir 	 	dna	.
and	it	's	by	looking	at	the	pattern	of	genetic	 vari 	 ation 	 	,	the	pattern	of	these	 marker 	 s 	 	in	people	all	over	the	world	,	and	 assess 	 ing 	 	the	 relat 	 ive 	 	 age 	 s 	 	when	they	 occur 	 red 	 	 through 	 out 	 	our	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	that	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	construct	a	family	tree	for	 every 	 body 	 	 al 	 ive 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
these	are	two	 piece 	 s 	 	of	dna	that	we	use	 quit 	 e 	 	 wide 	 ly 	 	in	our	work	.
 mitochondria 	 l 	 	dna	,	 trac 	 ing 	 	a	 pur 	 e 	 ly 	 	 ma 	 ternal 	 	line	of	 d 	 escent 	 	.
you	get	your	mtdna	from	your	mother	,	and	your	mother	's	mother	,
all	the	way	back	to	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	woman	.
the	y	 chromosom 	 e 	 	,	the	piece	of	dna	that	 make 	 s 	 	men	men	,	 trace 	 s 	 	a	 pur 	 e 	 ly 	 	 patern 	 al 	 	line	of	 d 	 escent 	 	.

now	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	these	are	 simpl 	 ified 	 	 version 	 s 	 	of	the	real	 tree 	 s 	 	,	they	're	still	kind	of	 complic 	 ated 	 	,	so	let	's	 simpl 	 ify 	 	them	.
turn	them	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 side 	 s 	 	,	combine	them	so	that	they	look	like	a	tree	with	the	root	at	the	bottom	and	the	 branch 	 es 	 	going	up	.
what	's	the	take	-	home	 mess 	 age 	 	?
well	,	the	thing	that	 jump 	 s 	 	out	at	you	first	is	that	the	 deep 	 est 	 	 line 	 age 	 s 	 	in	our	family	 tree 	 s 	 	are	found	 with 	 in 	 	africa	,	among	africans	.

and	what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	is	that	we	 origin 	 ated 	 	in	africa	.	it	's	written	in	our	dna	.
every	piece	of	dna	we	look	at	 ha 	 s 	 	 great 	 er 	 	 divers 	 ity 	 	 with 	 in 	 	africa	than	 out 	 side 	 	of	africa	.
and	at	some	point	in	the	past	,	a	sub	-	group	of	africans	left	the	african	continent	to	go	out	and	populate	the	rest	of	the	world	.
now	,	how	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	do	we	share	 th 	 is 	 	 ance 	 stry 	 	?
was	it	 million 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	which	we	might	suspect	by	looking	at	all	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	 vari 	 ation 	 	around	the	world	?
no	,	the	dna	 tell 	 s 	 	a	story	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	.
 with 	 in 	 	the	last	200,000	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	all	share	an	 ance 	 s 	 tor 	 	,	a	single	person	--	 mitochondria 	 l 	 	eve	,	you	might	have	heard	about	her	--	in	africa	,
an	african	woman	who	 g 	 ave 	 	rise	to	all	the	 mitochondria 	 l 	 	 divers 	 ity 	 	in	the	world	 to 	 day 	 	.
but	what	's	even	more	 amaz 	 ing 	 	is	that	if	you	look	at	the	y	-	 chromosom 	 e 	 	side	,	the	male	side	of	the	story	,	the	y	-	 chromosom 	 e 	 	adam	 on 	 ly 	 	lived	around	60,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
that	's	 on 	 ly 	 	about	2,000	human	 generation 	 s 	 	,
the	blink	of	an	eye	in	an	 evolution 	 ary 	 	sense	.
that	 tell 	 s 	 	us	we	 we 	 re 	 	all	still	living	in	africa	at	that	time	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	an	african	man	who	 g 	 ave 	 	rise	to	all	the	y	 chromosom 	 e 	 	 divers 	 ity 	 	around	the	world	.
it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	last	60,000	 year 	 s 	 	that	we	have	 start 	 ed 	 	to	generate	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	 divers 	 ity 	 	we	see	around	the	world	.
 s 	 uch 	 	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	story	.
we	're	all	 effective 	 ly 	 	part	of	an	 extend 	 ed 	 	african	family	.
now	,	that	 seem 	 s 	 	so	 re 	 cent 	 	.	why	did	n't	we	start	to	 leav 	 e 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	?
why	did	n't	homo	 erect 	 us 	 	evolve	 in 	 to 	 	 separat 	 e 	 	species	,	or	sub	-	species	 ra 	 ther 	 	,	human	 race 	 s 	 	around	the	world	?
why	was	it	that	we	seem	to	have	come	out	of	africa	so	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	?
well	,	that	's	a	big	question	.	these	``	why	``	 question 	 s 	 	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	in	 genetic 	 s 	 	and	the	 stud 	 y 	 	of	 histo 	 ry 	 	in	general	,	are	 al 	 ways 	 	the	big	 one 	 s 	 	,
the	 one 	 s 	 	that	are	tough	to	answer	.
and	so	when	all	else	 fail 	 s 	 	,	talk	about	the	weather	.
what	was	going	on	to	the	world	's	weather	around	60,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	?
well	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	going	 in 	 to 	 	the	worst	part	of	the	last	ice	age	.
the	last	ice	age	 start 	 ed 	 	 rough 	 ly 	 	120,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
it	went	up	and	down	,	and	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	to	 accele 	 rate 	 	around	70,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
 lot 	 s 	 	of	evidence	from	sediment	 core 	 s 	 	and	the	 poll 	 en 	 	 type 	 s 	 	,	oxygen	 isotope 	 s 	 	and	so	on	.
we	hit	the	last	 glaci 	 al 	 	 maxim 	 um 	 	around	16,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	but	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	from	70,000	 year 	 s 	 	on	,	 thing 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	tough	,
 get 	 ting 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	cold	.	the	 north 	 ern 	 	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	had	massive	growing	ice	 sheet 	 s 	 	.
new	york	city	,	chicago	,	seattle	,	all	under	a	sheet	of	ice	.
most	of	britain	,	all	of	scandinavia	,	 cover 	 ed 	 	by	ice	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 kilometer 	 s 	 	thick	.
now	,	africa	is	the	most	 tropic 	 al 	 	continent	on	the	planet	--	about	85	percent	of	it	lies	between	cancer	and	capricorn	--
and	there	are	n't	a	lot	of	 glaci 	 ers 	 	here	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	on	the	high	 mountain 	 s 	 	here	in	east	africa	.
so	what	was	going	on	here	?	we	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 cover 	 ed 	 	in	ice	in	africa	.
 ra 	 ther 	 	,	africa	was	 dry 	 ing 	 	out	at	that	time	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	paleo	-	climatological	map	of	what	africa	 look 	 ed 	 	like	between	60,000	and	70,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 re 	 construct 	 ed 	 	from	all	these	 piece 	 s 	 	of	evidence	that	i	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	before	.
the	reason	for	that	is	that	ice	 actual 	 ly 	 	 suck 	 s 	 	 moist 	 ure 	 	out	of	the	atmosphere	.
if	you	think	about	antarctica	,	it	's	 technical 	 ly 	 	a	desert	,	it	 get 	 s 	 	so	little	 precipit 	 ation 	 	.
so	the	whole	world	was	 dry 	 ing 	 	out	.
the	sea	 level 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	dropping	.	and	africa	was	 turn 	 ing 	 	to	desert	.
the	sahara	was	much	 big 	 ger 	 	then	than	it	is	now	.
and	the	human	 habit 	 at 	 	was	 reduc 	 ed 	 	to	just	a	few	small	 pocket 	 s 	 	,	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	what	we	have	 to 	 day 	 	.
the	evidence	from	genetic	data	is	that	the	human	population	around	 th 	 is 	 	time	,	 rough 	 ly 	 	70,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 crash 	 ed 	 	to	 few 	 er 	 	than	2,000	 individual 	 s 	 	.
we	 near 	 ly 	 	went	extinct	.	we	 we 	 re 	 	 hang 	 ing 	 	on	by	our	 finger 	 nail 	 s 	 	.
and	then	 some 	 thing 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.	a	great	 illustr 	 ation 	 	of	it	.
look	at	some	stone	 tool 	 s 	 	.
the	 one 	 s 	 	on	the	left	are	from	africa	,	from	around	a	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
the	 one 	 s 	 	on	the	right	 we 	 re 	 	made	by	 neanderthal 	 s 	 	,	our	 di 	 stant 	 	 cousin 	 s 	 	,	not	our	direct	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	,	living	in	europe	,
and	they	date	from	around	50,000	or	60,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
now	,	at	the	risk	of	 offend 	 ing 	 	any	 paleo 	 anthropo 	 logists 	 	or	physical	 anthropo 	 logists 	 	in	the	audience	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	there	's	not	a	lot	of	change	between	these	two	stone	tool	 group 	 s 	 	.
the	 one 	 s 	 	on	the	left	are	 pre 	 tty 	 	similar	to	the	 one 	 s 	 	on	the	right	.
we	are	in	a	period	of	long	cultural	 s 	 ta 	 sis 	 	from	a	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	 un 	 til 	 	around	60,000	to	70,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
the	tool	 style 	 s 	 	do	n't	change	that	much	.
the	evidence	is	that	the	human	way	of	life	did	n't	change	that	much	 dur 	 ing 	 	that	period	.
but	then	50	,	60	,	70	thousand	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 some 	 where 	 	in	that	region	,	all	hell	 break 	 s 	 	loose	.	art	 make 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 appear 	 ance 	 	.
the	stone	 tool 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	much	more	 fine 	 ly 	 	 craft 	 ed 	 	.
the	evidence	is	that	 human 	 s 	 	begin	to	 special 	 ize 	 	in	 part 	 icular 	 	 pre 	 y 	 	species	,	at	 part 	 icular 	 	 time 	 s 	 	of	the	year	.
the	population	 s 	 ize 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	to	expand	.

we	 be 	 came 	 	much	more	social	.	the	social	 network 	 s 	 	 expand 	 ed 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	change	in	behavior	 allow 	 ed 	 	us	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	these	 worsen 	 ing 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	in	africa	,	and	they	 allow 	 ed 	 	us	to	start	to	expand	around	the	world	.
we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	about	african	success	 st 	 ories 	 	.
well	,	you	want	the	ultimate	african	success	story	?
look	in	the	mirror	.	you	're	it	.	the	reason	you	're	 al 	 ive 	 	 to 	 day 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 change 	 s 	 	in	our	 brain 	 s 	 	that	took	place	in	africa	--	 prob 	 ably 	 	 some 	 where 	 	in	the	region	where	we	're	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	right	now	,	around	60	,	70	thousand	 year 	 s 	 	ago	--	 allow 	 ing 	 	us	not	 on 	 ly 	 	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	in	africa	,	but	to	expand	out	of	africa	.

an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	story	,	and	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	first	in	africa	.
the	 change 	 s 	 	that	 allow 	 ed 	 	us	to	do	that	,	the	evolution	of	 th 	 is 	 	 high 	 ly 	 	 adapt 	 able 	 	brain	that	we	all	carry	around	with	us	,	 allow 	 ing 	 	us	to	create	novel	 culture 	 s 	 	,

now	,	that	story	i	just	told	you	is	 liter 	 ally 	 	a	 whirl 	 wind 	 	tour	of	how	we	 populate 	 d 	 	the	world	,	the	great	paleolithic	 wander 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	our	species	.
and	that	's	the	story	that	i	told	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	in	my	book	,	``	the	journey	of	man	,	``	and	a	film	that	we	made	with	the	same	title	.

which	is	a	great	question	to	be	 ask 	 ed 	 	by	national	 geo 	 graphic 	 	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	you	know	,	what	i	've	 sketch 	 ed 	 	out	here	is	just	that	.
it	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	coarse	sketch	of	how	we	 migr 	 ated 	 	around	the	planet	.
and	it	's	based	on	a	few	thousand	people	we	've	 s 	 ampl 	 ed 	 	from	,	you	know	,	a	 hand 	 ful 	 	of	 population 	 s 	 	around	the	world	.	 stud 	 ied 	 	a	few	genetic	 marker 	 s 	 	,	and	there	are	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 gap 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	map	.

and	that	was	the	genesis	of	the	genographic	project	.
the	project	 launch 	 ed 	 	in	april	2005	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	three	core	 component 	 s 	 	.	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	science	is	a	big	part	of	it	.
the	field	research	that	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	around	the	world	with	 indi 	 genous 	 	 people 	 s 	 	.
people	who	have	lived	in	the	same	location	for	a	long	period	of	time
retain	a	 connect 	 ion 	 	to	the	place	where	they	live	that	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	rest	of	us	have	lost	.
so	my	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	come	from	all	over	 north 	 ern 	 	europe	.
i	live	in	the	eastern	 sea 	 board 	 	of	north	america	when	i	'm	not	 travel 	 ing 	 	.

that	's	the	focus	of	the	field	research	,	the	 center 	 s 	 	that	we	've	set	up	all	over	the	world	--
10	of	them	,	top	population	 genetic 	 ists 	 	.
but	,	in	 add 	 ition 	 	,	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	open	up	 th 	 is 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	to	 any 	 body 	 	around	the	world	.
how	often	do	you	get	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	in	a	big	scientific	project	?
the	human	genome	project	,	or	a	mars	 r 	 over 	 	mission	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	can	.
you	can	go	onto	our	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	nationalgeographic.com/genographic	.
you	can	order	a	kit	.	you	can	test	your	own	dna	.
