i	'll	just	start	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	17th	century	.
i	hope	 no 	 body 	 	 find 	 s 	 	that	offensive	.
i	--	you	know	,	when	i	--	after	i	had	 invent 	 ed 	 	pcr	,	i	kind	of	 need 	 ed 	 	a	change	.
and	i	 move 	 d 	 	down	to	la	jolla	and	 learn 	 ed 	 	how	to	surf	.
and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	living	down	there	on	the	beach	for	a	long	time	.
and	when	 surf 	 ers 	 	are	out	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	 wave 	 s 	 	,	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	wonder	,	if	you	've	never	 be 	 en 	 	out	there	,	what	are	they	 do 	 ing 	 	?
you	know	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	there	's	a	10-	,	15	-	minute	break	out	there	when	you	're	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	a	wave	to	come	in	.
they	 usual 	 ly 	 	talk	about	the	17th	century	.
you	know	,	they	get	a	real	bad	rap	in	the	world	.
people	think	they	're	sort	of	 low 	 brow 	 s 	 	.
one	day	,	 some 	 body 	 	 suggest 	 ed 	 	i	read	 th 	 is 	 	book	.
it	was	 call 	 ed 	 	--	it	was	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	air	pump	,	``	or	 some 	 thing 	 	like	``	the	 le 	 via 	 than 	 	and	the	air	pump	.	``
it	was	a	real	weird	book	about	the	17th	century	.
and	i	 real 	 ized 	 	,	the	 root 	 s 	 	of	the	way	i	sort	of	thought	was	just	the	 on 	 ly 	 	natural	way	to	think	about	 thing 	 s 	 	.
that	--	you	know	,	i	was	born	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 thing 	 s 	 	that	way	,	and	i	had	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	like	a	little	scientist	guy	.
and	when	i	went	to	find	out	 some 	 thing 	 	,	i	used	scientific	 method 	 s 	 	.	i	was	n't	real	 surprise 	 d 	 	,	you	know	,	when	they	first	told	me	how	--	how	you	 we 	 re 	 	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	do	science	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'd	 al 	 ready 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	it	for	 f 	 un 	 	and	 what 	 ever 	 	.
but	it	did	n't	--	it	never	 occur 	 red 	 	to	me	that	it	had	to	be	 invent 	 ed 	 	and	that	it	had	 be 	 en 	 	 invent 	 ed 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	350	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
you	know	,	it	was	--	like	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	england	,	and	germany	,	and	italy	sort	of	all	at	the	same	time	.
and	the	story	of	that	,	i	thought	,	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 fasci 	 nating 	 	.
so	i	'm	going	to	talk	a	little	bit	about	that	,	and	what	 exact 	 ly 	 	is	it	that	 scientist 	 s 	 	are	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	do	.
and	it	's	,	it	's	a	kind	of	--	you	know	,	charles	i	got	 be 	 headed 	 	 some 	 where 	 	early	in	the	17th	century	.
and	the	english	set	up	cromwell	and	a	whole	bunch	of	republicans	or	 what 	 ever 	 	,	and	not	the	kind	of	republicans	we	had	.
they	 change 	 d 	 	the	government	,	and	it	did	n't	work	.
and	charles	ii	,	the	son	,	was	 final 	 ly 	 	put	back	on	the	 thr 	 one 	 	of	england	.
he	was	 re 	 ally 	 	nervous	,	 be 	 cause 	 	his	dad	had	 be 	 en 	 	,	you	know	,	 be 	 headed 	 	for	 be 	 ing 	 	the	king	of	england	and	he	was	nervous	about	the	fact	that	 conversation 	 s 	 	that	got	going	in	,	like	,	 bar 	 s 	 	and	stuff	would	turn	to	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	kind	of	--	it	's	hard	to	 believ 	 e 	 	,	but	people	in	the	17th	century	in	england	 we 	 re 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	to	talk	about	,	you	know	,	 philosoph 	 y 	 	and	stuff	in	 bar 	 s 	 	.
they	did	n't	have	tv	 screen 	 s 	 	,	and	they	did	n't	have	any	 foot 	 ball 	 	 game 	 s 	 	to	watch	.
and	they	would	get	 re 	 ally 	 	 piss 	 y 	 	,	and	all	of	a	sudden	people	would	 s 	 pill 	 	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	street	and	fight	about	 issue 	 s 	 	like	 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	it	was	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	if	robert	boyle	made	a	 de 	 vice 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	vacuum	pump	.
now	,	boyle	was	a	friend	of	charles	ii	.	he	was	a	christian	guy	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	 week 	 end 	 s 	 	,	but	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	week	he	was	a	scientist	.
which	was	--	back	then	it	was	sort	of	,	you	know	,	well	,	you	know	--	if	you	made	 th 	 is 	 	thing	--	he	made	 th 	 is 	 	little	 de 	 vice 	 	,	like	kind	of	like	a	 bi 	 cycle 	 	pump	in	reverse	that	could	suck	all	the	air	out	of	--	you	know	what	a	bell	jar	is	?	one	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	you	pick	it	up	,	put	it	down	,	and	it	's	got	a	seal	,	and	you	can	see	 in 	 side 	 	of	it	,	so	you	can	see	what	's	going	on	 in 	 side 	 	 th 	 is 	 	thing	.
but	what	he	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	was	to	pump	all	the	air	out	of	there	,	and	see	what	would	happen	 in 	 side 	 	there	.
i	mean	,	the	first	--	i	think	one	of	the	first	 experiment 	 s 	 	he	did	was	he	put	a	bird	in	there	.
and	people	in	the	17th	century	,	they	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	understand	the	same	way	we	do	about	you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	is	a	bunch	of	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 molecule 	 s 	 	,	and	we	breathe	it	in	for	a	purpose	and	all	that	.
i	mean	,	fish	do	n't	know	much	about	water	,	and	people	did	n't	know	much	about	air	.
but	both	 start 	 ed 	 	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	it	.
one	thing	,	he	put	a	bird	in	there	,	and	he	 pump 	 ed 	 	all	the	air	out	,	and	the	bird	 di 	 ed 	 	.	so	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	hmm	...
he	 s 	 aid 	 	--	he	 call 	 ed 	 	what	he	'd	 d 	 one 	 	 a 	 s 	 	making	--	they	did	n't	call	it	a	vacuum	pump	at	the	time	.
now	you	call	it	a	vacuum	pump	;	he	 call 	 ed 	 	it	a	vacuum	.
right	?	and	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	,	he	got	 in 	 to 	 	trouble	with	the	local	clergy	who	 s 	 aid 	 	,	you	ca	n't	make	a	vacuum	.
ah	,	uh	--	aristotle	 s 	 aid 	 	that	nature	 abhor 	 s 	 	one	.
i	think	it	was	a	poor	 transl 	 ation 	 	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	,	but	people	 reli 	 ed 	 	on	 author 	 ities 	 	like	that	.
and	you	know	,	boyle	 say 	 s 	 	,	well	,	shit	.
i	make	them	all	the	time	.
i	mean	,	 what 	 ever 	 	that	is	that	 kill 	 s 	 	the	bird	--	and	i	'm	 call 	 ing 	 	it	a	vacuum	.
and	the	religious	people	 s 	 aid 	 	that	if	god	 want 	 ed 	 	you	to	make	--	i	mean	,	god	is	 every 	 where 	 	,	that	was	one	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 rule 	 s 	 	,	is	god	is	 every 	 where 	 	.
and	a	vacuum	--	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	in	a	vacuum	,	so	you	've	--	god	could	n't	be	in	there	.
so	 there 	 fore 	 	the	church	 s 	 aid 	 	that	you	ca	n't	make	a	vacuum	,	you	know	.
and	boyle	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 bull 	 shit 	 	.
i	mean	,	you	want	to	call	it	 god 	 less 	 	,	you	know	,	you	call	it	 god 	 less 	 	.
but	that	's	not	my	job	.	i	'm	not	 in 	 to 	 	that	.
i	do	that	on	the	 week 	 end 	 	.	and	like	--	what	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	is	figure	out	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	you	suck	 every 	 thing 	 	out	of	a	compartment	.
and	he	did	all	these	cute	little	 experiment 	 s 	 	.
like	he	did	one	with	--	he	had	a	little	wheel	,	like	a	fan	,	that	was	sort	of	 loose 	 ly 	 	 attach 	 ed 	 	,	so	it	could	spin	by	 it 	 self 	 	.
he	had	 an 	 other 	 	fan	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	it	that	he	had	like	a	--	i	mean	,	the	way	i	would	have	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	would	be	,	like	,	a	rubber	band	,	and	,	you	know	,	around	a	tinker	 to 	 y 	 	kind	of	fan	.
i	know	 exact 	 ly 	 	how	he	did	it	;	i	've	 s 	 een 	 	the	 draw 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
it	's	two	 fan 	 s 	 	,	one	which	he	could	turn	from	 out 	 side 	 	after	he	got	the	vacuum	 establish 	 ed 	 	,	and	he	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	if	he	 pull 	 ed 	 	all	the	air	out	of	it	,	the	one	fan	would	no	 long 	 er 	 	turn	the	other	one	,	right	?
 some 	 thing 	 	was	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	,	you	know	.	i	mean	,	these	are	--	it	's	kind	of	weird	to	think	that	 some 	 one 	 	had	to	do	an	experiment	to	show	that	,	but	that	was	what	was	going	on	at	the	time	.
and	like	,	there	was	big	 argument 	 s 	 	about	it	in	the	--	you	know	,	the	gin	 house 	 s 	 	and	in	the	coffee	 shop 	 s 	 	and	stuff	.
and	charles	 start 	 ed 	 	not	 lik 	 ing 	 	that	.
charles	ii	was	kind	of	 say 	 ing 	 	,	you	know	,	you	should	keep	that	--	let	's	make	a	place	where	you	can	do	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	where	people	do	n't	get	so	--	you	know	,	we	do	n't	want	the	--	we	do	n't	want	to	get	the	people	mad	at	me	 aga 	 in 	 	.	and	so	--	 be 	 cause 	 	when	they	 start 	 ed 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 relig 	 ion 	 	and	science	and	stuff	like	that	,	that	's	when	it	had	sort	of	gotten	his	father	in	trouble	.
and	so	,	charles	 s 	 aid 	 	,	i	'm	going	to	put	up	the	money	give	you	 guy 	 s 	 	a	building	,	come	here	and	you	can	meet	in	the	building	,	but	just	do	n't	talk	about	 relig 	 ion 	 	in	there	.
and	that	was	fine	with	boyle	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	ok	,	we	're	going	to	start	 hav 	 ing 	 	these	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
and	 any 	 body 	 	who	 want 	 s 	 	to	do	science	is	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	about	the	time	that	isaac	newton	was	 start 	 ing 	 	to	whip	out	a	lot	of	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	there	was	all	kind	of	people	that	would	come	to	the	royal	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	they	 call 	 ed 	 	it	.	you	had	to	be	 dress 	 ed 	 	up	 pre 	 tty 	 	well	.
it	was	n't	like	a	ted	 con 	 ference 	 	.
that	was	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 cri 	 ter 	 ia 	 	,	was	that	you	be	--	you	 look 	 ed 	 	like	a	 gentle 	 man 	 	,	and	they	'd	let	 any 	 body 	 	could	come	.
you	did	n't	have	to	be	a	member	then	.
and	so	,	they	would	come	in	and	you	would	do	--	 any 	 body 	 	that	was	going	to	show	an	experiment	,	which	was	kind	of	a	new	word	at	the	time	,	 demonst 	 rate 	 	some	principle	,	they	had	to	do	it	on	stage	,	where	 every 	 body 	 	could	see	it	.
so	they	 we 	 re 	 	--	the	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	was	,	you	 we 	 re 	 	not	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	talk	about	final	 cause 	 s 	 	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	.
and	god	was	out	of	the	picture	.
the	actual	nature	of	 re 	 ality 	 	was	not	at	issue	.
you	're	not	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	talk	about	the	absolute	nature	of	 any 	 thing 	 	.
you	 we 	 re 	 	not	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	talk	about	 any 	 thing 	 	that	you	could	n't	 demonst 	 rate 	 	.
so	if	 some 	 body 	 	could	see	it	,	you	could	say	,	here	's	how	the	machine	 work 	 s 	 	,	here	's	what	we	do	,	and	then	here	's	what	 happen 	 s 	 	.
and	 see 	 ing 	 	what	 happen 	 s 	 	,	it	was	ok	to	 general 	 ize 	 	,	and	say	,	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	will	happen	 any 	 time 	 	we	make	one	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	so	you	can	start	making	up	some	 rule 	 s 	 	.
you	say	,	 any 	 time 	 	you	have	a	vacuum	state	,	you	will	discover	that	one	wheel	will	not	turn	 an 	 other 	 	one	,	if	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 connect 	 ion 	 	between	them	is	 what 	 ever 	 	was	there	before	the	vacuum	.	that	kind	of	thing	.
 candle 	 s 	 	ca	n't	burn	in	a	vacuum	,	 there 	 fore 	 	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	 spark 	 ler 	 s 	 	would	n't	either	.
it	's	not	clear	;	 actual 	 ly 	 	 spark 	 ler 	 s 	 	will	,	but	they	did	n't	know	that	.	they	did	n't	have	 spark 	 ler 	 s 	 	.	but	,	they	--	--	you	can	make	up	 rule 	 s 	 	,	but	they	have	to	 re 	 late 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	to	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	 demonst 	 rate 	 	.
and	most	the	 demonst 	 ration 	 s 	 	had	to	do	with	 visual 	 s 	 	.	like	if	you	do	an	experiment	on	stage	,	and	 no 	 body 	 	can	see	it	,	they	can	just	hear	it	,	they	would	 prob 	 ably 	 	think	you	 we 	 re 	 	 freak 	 y 	 	.
i	mean	,	 re 	 ality 	 	is	what	you	can	see	.
that	was	n't	an	 ex 	 plicit 	 	rule	in	the	 meet 	 ing 	 	,	but	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	that	was	part	of	it	,	you	know	.	if	people	hear	 voice 	 s 	 	,	and	they	ca	n't	see	and	associate	it	with	 some 	 body 	 	,	that	person	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	not	there	.
but	the	general	idea	that	you	could	 on 	 ly 	 	--	you	could	 on 	 ly 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	talk	about	 thing 	 s 	 	in	that	place	that	had	some	kind	of	 experiment 	 al 	 	 bas 	 is 	 	.
it	did	n't	matter	what	thomas	hobbes	,	who	was	a	local	 philosoph 	 er 	 	,	 s 	 aid 	 	about	it	,	you	know	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	 we 	 re 	 	n't	going	to	be	 talk 	 ing 	 	final	 cause 	 s 	 	.
what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	here	,	in	the	middle	of	the	17th	century	,	was	that	what	 be 	 came 	 	my	field	--	science	,	 experiment 	 al 	 	science	--	was	 pull 	 ing 	 	 it 	 self 	 	away	,	and	it	was	in	a	physical	way	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	going	to	do	it	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	over	here	,	but	it	was	 al 	 so 	 	what	--	it	was	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	thing	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
science	had	 be 	 en 	 	all	 inter 	 lock 	 ed 	 	with	 the 	 ology 	 	,	and	 philosoph 	 y 	 	,	and	--	and	--	and	 mathematic 	 s 	 	,	which	is	 re 	 ally 	 	not	science	.
but	 experiment 	 al 	 	science	had	 be 	 en 	 	 ti 	 ed 	 	up	with	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	the	 mathematic 	 s 	 	part	and	the	 experiment 	 al 	 	science	part	was	 pull 	 ing 	 	away	from	 philosoph 	 y 	 	.
and	--	 thing 	 s 	 	--	we	never	 look 	 ed 	 	back	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	so	cool	since	then	.
i	mean	,	it	just	--	it	just	--	 un 	 tangle 	 d 	 	a	thing	that	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 imp 	 ed 	 ing 	 	technology	from	 be 	 ing 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	.
and	,	i	mean	,	 every 	 body 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	--	now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	350	short	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
remember	,	that	's	a	short	time	.
it	was	300,000	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	,	 year 	 s 	 	ago	that	most	of	us	,	the	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	of	most	of	us	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	came	up	out	of	africa	and	 turn 	 ed 	 	to	the	left	.
you	know	,	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	 turn 	 ed 	 	to	the	right	,	there	are	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	in	the	japanese	 transl 	 ation 	 	.
but	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	--	a	long	time	ago	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	350	short	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
but	in	that	350	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	place	 ha 	 s 	 	just	 under 	 gone 	 	a	lot	of	 change 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	 every 	 body 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	 prob 	 ably 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	if	you	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	your	bag	--	some	of	you	,	i	know	,	did	n't	pick	up	your	 bag 	 s 	 	--	but	if	you	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	your	bag	,	 every 	 body 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	 ha 	 s 	 	got	in	 the 	 ir 	 	pocket	,	or	back	in	 the 	 ir 	 	room	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	350	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 king 	 s 	 	would	have	gone	to	war	to	have	.
i	mean	,	if	you	can	think	how	 import 	 ant 	 	--	if	you	have	a	gps	system	and	there	are	no	 satellite 	 s 	 	,	it	's	not	going	to	be	much	use	.	but	,	like	--	but	,	you	know	,	if	 some 	 body 	 	had	a	gps	system	in	the	17th	century	some	king	would	have	gotten	together	an	 arm 	 y 	 	and	gone	to	get	it	,	you	know	.	if	that	person	--	audience	:	for	the	 ted 	 dy 	 	bear	?	the	 ted 	 dy 	 	bear	?
kary	mullis	:	they	might	have	 d 	 one 	 	it	for	the	 ted 	 dy 	 	bear	,	 yea 	 h 	 	.
but	--	all	of	us	own	stuff	.
i	mean	,	 individual 	 s 	 	own	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 king 	 s 	 	would	have	 definite 	 ly 	 	gone	to	war	to	get	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	350	 year 	 s 	 	.
not	a	whole	lot	of	people	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	.
you	know	,	the	 import 	 ant 	 	people	--	you	can	 al 	 most 	 	read	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	,	about	all	the	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	people	that	made	 advance 	 s 	 	,	you	know	.
and	,	i	mean	--	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	stuff	,	you	know	,	all	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	came	from	that	 separat 	 ion 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	little	sort	of	thing	that	we	do	--	now	i	,	when	i	was	a	boy	was	born	sort	of	with	 th 	 is 	 	idea	that	if	you	want	to	know	 some 	 thing 	 	--	you	know	,	 may 	 be 	 	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	my	old	man	was	gone	a	lot	,	and	my	mother	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	know	much	science	,	but	i	thought	if	you	want	to	know	 some 	 thing 	 	about	stuff	,	you	do	it	--	you	make	an	experiment	,	you	know	.
you	get	--	you	get	,	like	--	i	just	had	a	natural	 feel 	 ing 	 	for	science	and	setting	up	 experiment 	 s 	 	.	i	thought	that	was	the	way	 every 	 body 	 	had	 al 	 ways 	 	thought	.
i	thought	that	 any 	 body 	 	with	any	 brain 	 s 	 	will	do	it	that	way	.
it	is	n't	true	.	i	mean	,	there	's	a	lot	of	people	--	you	know	,	i	was	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 scientist 	 s 	 	that	was	--	got	 in 	 to 	 	trouble	the	other	night	at	 d 	 inner 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	post	-	 modern 	 ism 	 	thing	.
and	i	did	n't	mean	,	you	know	--	where	is	that	 lad 	 y 	 	?
audience	:	here	.
km	:	i	mean	,	i	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	think	of	that	 a 	 s 	 	an	argument	so	much	 a 	 s 	 	just	a	 live 	 ly 	 	 discuss 	 ion 	 	.
i	did	n't	take	it	 personal 	 ly 	 	,	but	--	i	just	--	i	had	--	i	 naive 	 ly 	 	had	thought	,	 un 	 til 	 	 th 	 is 	 	surfing	experience	 start 	 ed 	 	me	 in 	 to 	 	the	17th	century	,	i	'd	thought	that	's	just	the	way	people	thought	,	and	 every 	 body 	 	did	,	and	they	 recogn 	 ized 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	by	what	they	could	see	or	touch	or	feel	or	hear	.
at	any	rate	,	when	i	was	a	boy	,	i	,	like	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	i	had	 th 	 is 	 	--	i	got	 th 	 is 	 	little	book	from	fort	sill	,	oklahoma	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	about	the	time	that	george	dyson	's	dad	was	 start 	 ing 	 	to	blow	nuclear	--	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 blow 	 ing 	 	up	nuclear	 rocket 	 s 	 	and	stuff	.
i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	about	making	my	own	little	 rocket 	 s 	 	.
and	i	 k 	 new 	 	that	 frog 	 s 	 	--	little	 frog 	 s 	 	--	had	 aspir 	 ations 	 	of	space	travel	,	just	like	people	.	and	i	--	i	was	looking	for	a	--	a	 pro 	 pulsion 	 	system	that	would	like	,	make	a	rocket	,	like	,	 may 	 be 	 	about	four	feet	high	go	up	a	couple	of	 mile 	 s 	 	.
and	,	i	mean	,	that	was	my	sort	of	goal	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	it	to	go	out	of	sight	and	then	i	 want 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	little	 parachut 	 e 	 	to	come	back	with	the	frog	in	it	.	and	--	i	--	i	--	i	got	 th 	 is 	 	book	from	fort	sill	,	oklahoma	,	where	there	's	a	 mis 	 s 	 ile 	 	base	.
they	 s 	 end 	 	it	out	for	amateur	 rocket 	 e 	 ers 	 	,	and	it	 s 	 aid 	 	in	there	do	not	ever	heat	a	 mix 	 ture 	 	of	 pot 	 ass 	 ium 	 	 per 	 chlorate 	 	and	sugar	.
you	know	,	that	's	what	you	call	a	lead	.	you	sort	of	--	now	you	say	,	well	,	let	's	see	if	i	can	get	hold	of	some	 pot 	 ass 	 ium 	 	chlorate	and	sugar	,	 per 	 chlorate 	 	and	sugar	,	and	heat	it	;	it	would	be	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	see	what	it	is	they	do	n't	want	me	to	do	,	and	what	it	is	going	to	--	and	how	is	it	going	to	work	.
and	we	did	n't	have	--	like	,	my	mother	 pre 	 sided 	 	over	the	back	yard	from	an	 up 	 stair 	 s 	 	window	,	where	she	would	be	 iron 	 ing 	 	or	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
and	she	was	 usual 	 ly 	 	just	sort	of	 keep 	 ing 	 	an	eye	on	,	and	if	there	was	any	 puff 	 s 	 	of	smoke	out	there	,	she	'd	lean	out	and	admonish	us	all	not	to	blow	our	 eye 	 s 	 	out	.	that	was	her	--	you	know	,	that	was	kind	of	the	worst	thing	that	could	happen	to	us	.
that	's	why	i	thought	,	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	i	do	n't	blow	my	 eye 	 s 	 	out	...
i	may	not	care	about	the	fact	that	it	's	 prohibit 	 ed 	 	from	 heat 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	solution	.
i	'm	going	to	do	it	 care 	 fully 	 	,	but	i	'll	do	it	.
it	's	like	 any 	 thing 	 	else	that	's	 prohibit 	 ed 	 	:	you	do	it	 be 	 hind 	 	the	 gar 	 age 	 	.
so	,	i	went	to	the	drug	store	and	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	buy	some	 pot 	 ass 	 ium 	 	 per 	 chlorate 	 	and	it	was	n't	 un 	 reason 	 able 	 	then	for	a	kid	to	walk	 in 	 to 	 	a	drug	store	and	buy	 chemical 	 s 	 	.
 now 	 a 	 day 	 s 	 	,	it	's	no	ma'am	,	check	your	 shoe 	 s 	 	.	and	like	--	but	then	it	was	n't	--	they	did	n't	have	any	,	but	the	guy	had	--	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	what	kind	of	 salt 	 s 	 	or	 pot 	 ass 	 ium 	 	do	you	have	?	you	know	.
and	he	had	 pot 	 ass 	 ium 	 	 nitr 	 ate 	 	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	that	might	do	the	same	thing	,	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	.
i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	it	's	got	to	do	with	 rocket 	 s 	 	or	it	would	n't	be	in	that	manual	.
and	so	i	--	i	did	some	 experiment 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	off	with	little	 tin 	 y 	 	 amount 	 s 	 	of	 pot 	 ass 	 ium 	 	 nitr 	 ate 	 	and	sugar	,	which	was	 read 	 ily 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	,	and	i	 mix 	 ed 	 	it	in	different	 proportion 	 s 	 	,	and	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	light	it	on	fire	.
just	to	see	what	would	happen	,	if	you	 mix 	 ed 	 	it	together	.	and	it	--	they	 burn 	 ed 	 	.
it	 burn 	 ed 	 	kind	of	 s 	 low 	 	,	but	it	made	a	nice	smell	,	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	other	rocket	 fuel 	 s 	 	i	had	 tri 	 ed 	 	,	that	all	had	sulfur	in	them	.
and	,	it	 s 	 melt 	 	like	 burn 	 t 	 	 can 	 dy 	 	.
and	then	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	the	 melt 	 ing 	 	business	,	and	i	 melt 	 ed 	 	it	.
and	then	it	 melt 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	little	sort	of	 syrup 	 y 	 	liquid	,	 brow 	 n 	 	.
and	then	it	 cool 	 ed 	 	down	to	a	brick	-	hard	 sub 	 stance 	 	,	that	when	you	lit	that	,	it	went	off	like	a	bat	.
i	mean	,	the	little	bowl	of	that	stuff	that	had	 cool 	 ed 	 	down	--	you	'd	light	it	,	and	it	would	just	start	 danc 	 ing 	 	around	the	yard	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	there	is	a	way	to	get	a	frog	up	to	where	he	 want 	 s 	 	to	go	.
so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 develop 	 ing 	 	--	you	know	,	george	's	dad	had	a	lot	of	help	.	i	just	had	my	brother	.
but	i	--	it	took	me	about	--	it	took	me	about	,	i	'd	say	,	six	 month 	 s 	 	to	 final 	 ly 	 	figure	out	all	the	little	 thing 	 s 	 	.
there	's	a	lot	of	little	 thing 	 s 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	making	a	rocket	that	it	will	 actual 	 ly 	 	work	,	even	after	you	have	the	fuel	.
but	you	do	it	,	by	--	what	i	just	--	you	know	,	you	do	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	and	you	write	down	 thing 	 s 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	you	make	 observ 	 ations 	 	,	you	know	.
and	then	you	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	build	up	a	 theor 	 y 	 	of	how	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	 work 	 s 	 	.
and	it	was	--	i	was	 follow 	 ing 	 	all	the	 rule 	 s 	 	.
i	did	n't	know	what	the	 rule 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	,	i	'm	a	natural	born	scientist	,	i	guess	,	or	some	kind	of	a	 throw 	 back 	 	to	the	17th	century	,	 what 	 ever 	 	.
but	at	any	rate	,	we	 final 	 ly 	 	did	have	a	 de 	 vice 	 	that	would	 re 	 produce 	 ably 	 	put	a	frog	out	of	sight	and	get	him	back	 al 	 ive 	 	.
and	we	had	not	--	i	mean	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 frighten 	 ed 	 	by	it	.
we	should	have	 be 	 en 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	made	a	lot	of	smoke	and	it	made	a	lot	of	noise	,	and	it	was	 power 	 ful 	 	,	you	know	.
and	once	in	a	while	,	they	would	blow	up	.
but	i	was	n't	 worri 	 ed 	 	,	by	the	way	,	about	,	you	know	,	the	explosion	 caus 	 ing 	 	the	 destruct 	 ion 	 	of	the	planet	.
i	had	n't	heard	about	the	10	ways	that	we	should	be	 af 	 raid 	 	of	the	--	by	the	way	,	i	could	have	thought	,	i	'd	better	not	do	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	say	not	to	,	you	know	.
and	i	'd	better	get	 per 	 mission 	 	from	the	government	.
if	i	'd	have	 wait 	 ed 	 	around	for	that	,	i	would	have	never	--	the	frog	would	have	 di 	 ed 	 	,	you	know	.
at	any	rate	,	i	 br 	 ing 	 	it	up	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	a	good	story	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	tell	personal	 thing 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	and	that	's	a	personal	--	i	was	going	to	tell	you	about	the	first	night	that	i	met	my	wife	,	but	that	would	be	too	personal	,	would	n't	it	.
so	,	so	i	've	got	 some 	 thing 	 	else	that	's	not	personal	.
but	that	...	process	is	what	i	think	of	 a 	 s 	 	science	,	see	,	where	you	start	with	some	idea	,	and	then	 in 	 stead 	 	of	,	like	,	looking	up	,	every	 author 	 ity 	 	that	you	've	ever	heard	of	i	--	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	you	do	that	,	if	you	're	going	to	write	a	paper	 lat 	 er 	 	,	you	want	to	figure	out	who	else	 ha 	 s 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	on	it	.
but	in	the	actual	process	,	you	get	an	idea	--	like	,	when	i	got	the	idea	one	night	that	i	could	 ampl 	 ify 	 	dna	with	two	oligonucleotides	,	and	i	could	make	 lot 	 s 	 	of	copies	of	some	little	piece	of	dna	,	you	know	,	the	 think 	 ing 	 	for	that	was	about	20	 minute 	 s 	 	while	i	was	 driv 	 ing 	 	my	car	,	and	then	 in 	 stead 	 	of	going	--	i	went	back	and	i	did	talk	to	people	about	it	,	but	if	i	'd	 listen 	 ed 	 	to	what	i	heard	from	all	my	 friend 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	 mole 	 cular 	 	 biologist 	 s 	 	--	i	would	have	 abandon 	 ed 	 	it	.
you	know	,	if	i	had	gone	back	looking	for	an	 author 	 ity 	 	figure	who	could	tell	me	if	it	would	work	or	not	,	he	would	have	 s 	 aid 	 	,	no	,	it	 prob 	 ably 	 	wo	n't	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	 result 	 s 	 	of	it	 we 	 re 	 	so	spectacular	that	if	it	 work 	 ed 	 	it	was	going	to	change	 every 	 body 	 	's	 god 	 damn 	 	way	of	 do 	 ing 	 	 mole 	 cular 	 	biology	.
 no 	 body 	 	 want 	 s 	 	a	chemist	to	come	in	and	poke	around	in	 the 	 ir 	 	stuff	like	that	and	change	 thing 	 s 	 	.
but	if	you	go	to	 author 	 ity 	 	,	and	you	 al 	 ways 	 	do	n't	--	you	do	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	get	the	right	answer	,	see	.
but	i	 k 	 new 	 	,	you	'd	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	lab	and	you	'd	try	to	make	it	work	 your 	 self 	 	.	and	then	you	're	the	 author 	 ity 	 	,	and	you	can	say	,	i	know	it	 work 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	right	there	in	that	tube	is	where	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	and	here	,	on	 th 	 is 	 	gel	,	there	's	a	little	band	there	that	i	know	that	's	dna	,	and	that	's	the	dna	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 ampl 	 ify 	 	,	so	there	!	so	it	 do 	 es 	 	work	.
you	know	,	that	's	how	you	do	science	.
and	then	you	say	,	well	,	what	can	make	it	work	better	?
and	then	you	figure	out	better	and	better	ways	to	do	it	.
but	you	 al 	 ways 	 	work	from	,	from	like	,	 fact 	 s 	 	that	you	have	made	 avail 	 able 	 	to	you	by	 do 	 ing 	 	 experiment 	 s 	 	:	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	could	do	on	a	stage	.
and	no	 trick 	 y 	 	shit	 be 	 hind 	 	the	thing	.	i	mean	,	it	's	all	--	you	've	got	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	honest	with	what	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	if	it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	going	to	work	.
i	mean	,	you	ca	n't	make	up	 result 	 s 	 	,	and	then	do	 an 	 other 	 	experiment	based	on	that	one	.
so	you	have	to	be	honest	.
and	i	'm	 bas 	 ically 	 	honest	.
i	have	a	 fair 	 ly 	 	bad	 memor 	 y 	 	,	and	 dis 	 honest 	 y 	 	would	 al 	 ways 	 	get	me	in	trouble	,	if	i	,	like	--	so	i	've	just	sort	of	 be 	 en 	 	 natural 	 ly 	 	honest	and	 natural 	 ly 	 	inquisitive	,	and	that	sort	of	 lead 	 s 	 	to	that	kind	of	science	.
now	,	let	's	see	...
i	've	got	 an 	 other 	 	five	 minute 	 s 	 	,	right	?
ok	.	all	 scientist 	 s 	 	are	n't	like	that	.
you	know	--	and	there	is	a	lot	--	there	is	a	lot	--	a	lot	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	going	on	since	isaac	newton	and	all	that	stuff	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	right	around	world	war	ii	in	that	same	time	period	before	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	 a 	 s 	 	hell	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	government	got	--	 real 	 ized 	 	that	 scientist 	 s 	 	are	n't	strange	 du 	 de 	 s 	 	that	,	you	know	,	hide	in	 iv 	 ory 	 	 tower 	 s 	 	and	do	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	with	test	tube	.
 scientist 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	made	world	war	ii	 a 	 s 	 	we	know	it	 quit 	 e 	 	possible	.
they	made	 fast 	 er 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
they	made	 big 	 ger 	 	 gun 	 s 	 	to	shoot	them	down	with	.
you	know	,	they	made	 drug 	 s 	 	to	give	the	 pilot 	 s 	 	if	they	 we 	 re 	 	broken	up	in	the	process	.	they	made	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	--	and	then	 final 	 ly 	 	one	giant	bomb	to	end	the	whole	thing	,	right	?
and	 every 	 body 	 	 steppe 	 d 	 	back	a	little	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	you	know	,	we	ought	to	invest	in	 th 	 is 	 	shit	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 who 	 ever 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	got	the	most	of	these	people	 work 	 ing 	 	in	the	 place 	 s 	 	is	going	to	have	a	 domin 	 ant 	 	position	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	in	the	 militar 	 y 	 	,	and	 prob 	 ably 	 	in	all	kind	of	economic	ways	.
and	they	got	 involve 	 d 	 	in	it	,	and	the	scientific	and	industrial	 establish 	 ment 	 	was	born	,	and	out	of	that	came	a	lot	of	 scientist 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	in	there	for	the	money	,	you	know	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	.
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	the	 cur 	 ious 	 	little	 boy 	 s 	 	that	 like 	 d 	 	to	put	 frog 	 s 	 	up	in	the	air	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	the	same	people	that	 lat 	 er 	 	went	in	to	medical	school	,	you	know	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	was	money	in	it	,	you	know	.	i	mean	,	 lat 	 er 	 	,	then	they	all	got	 in 	 to 	 	business	--	i	mean	,	there	are	 wave 	 s 	 	of	--	going	 in 	 to 	 	your	high	school	,	person	 say 	 ing 	 	,	you	want	to	be	rich	,	you	know	,	be	a	scientist	.	you	know	,	not	 any 	 more 	 	.
you	want	to	be	rich	,	you	be	a	 business 	 man 	 	.
but	a	lot	of	people	got	in	it	for	the	money	and	the	power	and	the	travel	.
that	's	back	when	travel	was	easy	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	people	do	n't	think	--	they	do	n't	--	they	do	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	tell	you	the	truth	,	you	know	.
there	is	 noth 	 ing 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	contract	,	in	fact	,	that	 make 	 s 	 	it	to	 the 	 ir 	 	advantage	 al 	 ways 	 	,	to	tell	you	the	truth	.
and	the	people	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	are	people	that	like	--	they	say	that	they	're	a	member	of	the	 commit 	 tee 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	,	say	,	the	inter	-	 government 	 al 	 	 pan 	 el 	 	on	climate	change	.
and	they	--	and	they	have	these	big	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	where	they	try	to	figure	out	how	we	're	going	to	--	how	we	're	going	to	 continu 	 ally 	 	prove	that	the	planet	is	 get 	 ting 	 	 warm 	 er 	 	,	when	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 contr 	 ary 	 	to	most	people	's	 sens 	 ations 	 	.
i	mean	,	if	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	measure	the	temperature	over	a	period	--	i	mean	,	the	temperature	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 measur 	 ed 	 	now	 pre 	 tty 	 	 care 	 fully 	 	for	about	50	,	60	 year 	 s 	 	--	 long 	 er 	 	than	that	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 measur 	 ed 	 	,	but	in	 re 	 ally 	 	nice	,	precise	ways	,	and	 record 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 ke 	 pt 	 	for	50	or	60	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	in	fact	,	the	temperature	had	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	gone	up	.
it	's	like	,	the	average	temperature	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	up	a	 tin 	 y 	 	little	bit	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 night 	 time 	 	 temperature 	 s 	 	at	the	weather	 station 	 s 	 	have	come	up	just	a	little	bit	.
but	there	's	a	good	 explan 	 ation 	 	for	that	.
and	it	's	that	the	weather	 station 	 s 	 	are	all	built	 out 	 side 	 	of	town	,	where	the	 air 	 port 	 	was	,	and	now	the	town	's	 move 	 d 	 	out	there	,	there	's	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	all	around	and	they	call	it	the	 sky 	 line 	 	effect	.
and	most	 respons 	 ible 	 	people	that	measure	 temperature 	 s 	 	 real 	 ize 	 	you	have	to	shield	your	 measur 	 ing 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	from	that	.
and	even	then	,	you	know	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 building 	 s 	 	get	warm	in	the	 day 	 time 	 	,	and	they	keep	it	a	little	 warm 	 er 	 	at	night	.
so	the	temperature	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	,	sort	of	,	 inch 	 ing 	 	up	.
it	should	have	 be 	 en 	 	.	but	not	a	lot	.	not	like	,	you	know	--	the	first	guy	--	the	first	guy	that	got	the	idea	that	we	're	going	to	fry	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	here	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	he	did	n't	think	of	it	that	way	.
his	name	was	sven	arrhenius	.	he	was	swedish	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	if	you	double	the	co	2	level	in	the	atmosphere	,	which	he	thought	might	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	in	1900	--	the	temperature	ought	to	go	up	about	5.5	 degree 	 s 	 	,	he	 calcul 	 ated 	 	.
he	was	 think 	 ing 	 	of	the	earth	 a 	 s 	 	,	kind	of	like	,	you	know	,	like	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	 insulate 	 d 	 	thing	with	no	stuff	in	it	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	just	energy	coming	down	,	energy	 leav 	 ing 	 	.
and	so	he	came	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	will	be	cool	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	'll	be	a	 long 	 er 	 	growing	season	in	sweden	,	you	know	,	and	the	 surf 	 ers 	 	 like 	 d 	 	it	,	the	 surf 	 ers 	 	thought	,	that	's	a	cool	idea	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	cold	in	the	ocean	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	and	--	but	a	lot	of	other	people	 lat 	 er 	 	on	 start 	 ed 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	it	would	be	bad	,	you	know	.
but	 no 	 body 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 demonst 	 rated 	 	it	,	right	?
i	mean	,	the	temperature	 a 	 s 	 	 measur 	 ed 	 	--	and	you	can	find	 th 	 is 	 	on	our	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 inter 	 net 	 	,	you	just	go	and	look	for	all	nasas	 record 	 s 	 	,	and	all	the	weather	bureau	's	 record 	 s 	 	,	and	you	'll	look	at	it	 your 	 self 	 	,	and	you	'll	see	,	the	temperature	 ha 	 s 	 	just	--	the	 night 	 time 	 	temperature	 measur 	 ed 	 	on	the	surface	of	the	planet	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	up	a	 tin 	 y 	 	little	bit	.
so	if	you	just	average	that	and	the	 day 	 time 	 	temperature	,	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	it	went	up	about	.7	 degree 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	century	.
but	in	fact	,	it	was	just	coming	up	--	it	was	the	 night 	 time 	 	;	the	 day 	 time 	 	 temperature 	 s 	 	did	n't	go	up	.
so	--	and	arrhenius	'	 theor 	 y 	 	--	and	all	the	global	 warm 	 ers 	 	think	--	they	would	say	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	it	should	go	up	in	the	 day 	 time 	 	,	too	,	if	it	's	the	 green 	 house 	 	effect	.
now	,	people	like	 thing 	 s 	 	that	have	,	like	,	 name 	 s 	 	like	that	,	that	they	can	envision	it	,	right	?	i	mean	--	but	people	do	n't	like	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	so	--	most	--	i	mean	,	you	do	n't	get	all	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	 thing 	 s 	 	like	the	actual	evidence	,	you	know	,	which	would	be	evidence	for	 strength 	 en 	 ing 	 	of	the	 tropic 	 al 	 	 circul 	 ation 	 	in	the	1990s	.
it	's	a	paper	that	came	out	in	february	,	and	most	of	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	had	n't	heard	about	it	.
``	evidence	for	large	decadal	 vari 	 ability 	 	in	the	 tropic 	 al 	 	mean	 radi 	 ative 	 	energy	budget	.	``
excuse	me	.	 t 	 hose 	 	 paper 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	by	nasa	,	and	some	 scientist 	 s 	 	at	columbia	,	and	viliki	and	a	whole	bunch	of	people	,	princeton	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 paper 	 s 	 	came	out	in	science	magazine	,	february	the	first	,	and	these	--	the	 con 	 clusion 	 	in	both	of	these	 paper 	 s 	 	,	and	in	 al 	 so 	 	the	science	editor	's	,	like	,	 de 	 script 	 ions 	 	of	these	 paper 	 s 	 	,	for	,	you	know	,	for	the	 quick 	 ie 	 	,	is	that	our	 the 	 ories 	 	about	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	are	 complete 	 ly 	 	wrong	.	i	mean	,	what	these	 guy 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	--	the	nasa	people	have	 be 	 en 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	for	a	long	time	.
they	say	,	if	you	measure	the	temperature	of	the	atmosphere	,	it	is	n't	going	up	--	it	's	not	going	up	at	all	.	we	've	 do 	 ing 	 	it	 ver 	 y 	 	 care 	 fully 	 	now	for	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	from	 satellite 	 s 	 	,	and	it	is	n't	going	up	.	and	in	 th 	 is 	 	paper	,	they	show	 some 	 thing 	 	much	more	 s 	 tri 	 king 	 	,	and	that	was	that	they	did	what	they	call	a	 radi 	 ation 	 	--	and	i	'm	not	going	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	 detail 	 s 	 	of	it	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	,	but	it	is	n't	 a 	 s 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	might	make	you	think	it	is	by	the	 word 	 s 	 	they	use	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 paper 	 s 	 	.	if	you	 re 	 ally 	 	get	down	to	it	,	they	say	,	the	 s 	 un 	 	 put 	 s 	 	out	a	certain	amount	of	energy	--	we	know	how	much	that	is	--	it	 fall 	 s 	 	on	the	earth	,	the	earth	 give 	 s 	 	back	a	certain	amount	.
when	it	 get 	 s 	 	warm	it	 generate 	 s 	 	--	it	 make 	 s 	 	 red 	 der 	 	energy	--	i	mean	,	like	infra	-	red	,
like	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	warm	 give 	 s 	 	off	infra	-	red	.
the	whole	business	of	the	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	--	trash	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	is	that	--	if	the	--	if	there	's	too	much	co	2	in	the	atmosphere	,	the	heat	that	's	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 es 	 cape 	 	wo	n't	be	able	to	get	out	.	but	the	heat	coming	from	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	which	is	 most 	 ly 	 	down	in	the	--	it	's	like	350	 nano 	 meter 	 s 	 	,	which	is	where	it	's	 center 	 ed 	 	--	that	 go 	 es 	 	right	through	co	2	.
so	you	still	get	heated	,	but	you	do	n't	dissipate	any	.
well	,	these	 guy 	 s 	 	 measur 	 ed 	 	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
i	mean	,	you	can	talk	about	that	stuff	,	and	you	can	write	these	large	 report 	 s 	 	,	and	you	can	get	government	money	to	do	it	,	but	these	--	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	 measur 	 ed 	 	it	,	and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	in	the	last	10	 year 	 s 	 	--	that	's	why	they	say	``	decadal	``	there	--
that	the	energy	--	that	the	level	of	what	they	call	``	 im 	 balance 	 	``	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	way	the	hell	over	what	was	 expect 	 ed 	 	.
like	,	the	amount	of	 im 	 balance 	 	--	meaning	,	heat	's	coming	in	and	it	's	not	going	out	that	you	would	get	from	 hav 	 ing 	 	double	the	co	2	,	which	we	're	not	 any 	 where 	 	near	that	,	by	the	way	.
but	if	we	did	,	in	2025	or	 some 	 thing 	 	,	have	double	the	co	2	 a 	 s 	 	we	had	in	1900	,	they	say	it	would	be	 in 	 crease 	 	the	energy	budget	by	about	--	in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	one	watt	per	square	centimeter	more	would	be	coming	in	than	going	out	.
so	the	planet	should	get	 warm 	 er 	 	.
well	,	they	found	out	in	 th 	 is 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	--	these	two	 stud 	 ies 	 	by	two	different	 team 	 s 	 	--	that	five	and	a	half	 watt 	 s 	 	per	square	meter	had	 be 	 en 	 	coming	in	from	1998	,	1999	,	and	the	place	did	n't	get	 warm 	 er 	 	.
so	the	 theor 	 y 	 	's	 ka 	 put 	 	--	it	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
these	 paper 	 s 	 	should	have	 be 	 en 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	,	``	the	end	to	the	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	fiasco	,	``	you	know	.
they	're	 concern 	 ed 	 	,	and	you	can	tell	they	have	 ver 	 y 	 	 guard 	 ed 	 	 con 	 clusion 	 s 	 	in	these	 paper 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	big	 labor 	 ator 	 ies 	 	that	are	funded	by	 lot 	 s 	 	of	money	and	by	 scar 	 ed 	 	people	.
you	know	,	if	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	you	know	what	?
there	is	n't	a	problem	with	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	any	 long 	 er 	 	,	so	we	can	--	you	know	,	they	're	 fund 	 ing 	 	.
and	if	you	start	a	grant	request	with	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	,	and	say	,	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	 obvious 	 ly 	 	had	n't	 happen 	 ed 	 	...
if	they	--	if	they	--	if	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	if	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	that	,	i	'm	 get 	 ting 	 	out	.
i	'll	stand	up	too	,	and	--	they	have	to	say	that	.
they	had	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 c 	 aut 	 ious 	 	.
but	what	i	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	is	,	you	can	be	 de 	 light 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	editor	of	science	,	who	is	no	 d 	 um 	 my 	 	,	and	both	of	these	 fair 	 ly 	 	professional	--	 re 	 ally 	 	professional	 team 	 s 	 	,	have	 re 	 ally 	 	come	to	the	same	 con 	 clusion 	 	and	in	the	bottom	lines	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 paper 	 s 	 	they	have	to	say	,	what	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	is	,	that	what	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	,	was	the	global	 circul 	 ation 	 	model	that	we	predict	that	the	earth	is	going	to	get	 over 	 heated 	 	that	it	's	all	wrong	.	it	's	wrong	by	a	large	factor	.
it	's	not	by	a	small	one	.	they	just	--
they	just	 mis 	 interpret 	 ed 	 	the	fact	that	the	earth	--	there	's	 obvious 	 ly 	 	some	 mechan 	 ism 	 s 	 	going	on	that	 no 	 body 	 	 k 	 new 	 	about	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	heat	's	coming	in	and	it	is	n't	 get 	 ting 	 	 warm 	 er 	 	.
so	the	planet	is	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	thing	,	you	know	,	it	's	big	and	 horr 	 ible 	 	--	and	big	and	 wonder 	 ful 	 	,	and	it	 do 	 es 	 	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	we	do	n't	know	 any 	 thing 	 	about	.
so	i	mean	,	the	reason	i	put	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	all	together	,	ok	,	here	's	the	way	you	're	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	do	science	--	some	science	is	 d 	 one 	 	for	other	 reason 	 s 	 	,	and	just	curiosity	.
and	there	's	a	lot	of	 thing 	 s 	 	like	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	,	and	 o 	 zone 	 	hole	and	you	know	,	a	whole	bunch	of	scientific	public	 issue 	 s 	 	,	that	if	you	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	them	,	then	you	have	to	get	down	the	 detail 	 s 	 	,	and	read	the	 paper 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	,	``	large	decadal	 vari 	 ability 	 	in	the	...	``
you	have	to	figure	out	what	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 word 	 s 	 	mean	.
and	if	you	just	listen	to	the	 guy 	 s 	 	who	are	 hy 	 ping 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	,	and	making	a	lot	of	money	out	of	it	,	you	'll	be	 mis 	 inform 	 ed 	 	,	and	you	'll	be	 worry 	 ing 	 	about	the	wrong	 thing 	 s 	 	.
remember	the	10	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	going	to	get	you	.	the	--	one	of	them	--	and	the	 a 	 steroid 	 s 	 	is	the	one	i	 re 	 ally 	 	agree	with	there	.	i	mean	,	you	've	got	to	watch	out	for	 a 	 steroid 	 s 	 	.	ok	,	thank	you	for	 hav 	 ing 	 	me	here	.
