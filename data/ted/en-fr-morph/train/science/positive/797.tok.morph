if	you	think	about	the	phone	--	and	 in 	 tel 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	tested	a	lot	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	i	'm	going	to	show	you	,	over	the	last	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	in	about	600	 elder 	 ly 	 	 house 	 hold 	 s 	 	--	300	in	ireland	,	and	300	in	portland	--	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	:	how	do	we	measure	and	monitor	behavior	in	a	 medical 	 ly 	 	 meaning 	 ful 	 	way	?
and	if	you	think	about	the	phone	,	right	,	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	can	use	for	some	 in 	 credible 	 	ways	to	help	people	 actual 	 ly 	 	take	the	right	 medic 	 ation 	 	at	the	right	time	.
we	're	 test 	 ing 	 	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	simple	sensor	-	network	 techno 	 logies 	 	in	the	home	so	that	any	phone	that	a	senior	is	 al 	 ready 	 	 comfort 	 able 	 	with	can	help	them	deal	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 medic 	 ations 	 	.
and	a	lot	of	what	they	do	is	they	pick	up	the	phone	,	and	it	's	our	system	 whisper 	 ing 	 	to	them	which	pill	they	need	to	take	,	and	they	fake	like	they	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	conversation	with	a	friend	.
and	they	're	not	 embarrass 	 ed 	 	by	a	 med 	 s 	 	 c 	 addy 	 	that	's	 ug 	 ly 	 	,	that	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	kitchen	table	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	'm	old	.	i	'm	 f 	 rail 	 	.	``
it	's	 sur 	 rep 	 tit 	 ious 	 	technology	that	's	 help 	 ing 	 	them	do	a	simple	task	of	taking	the	right	pill	at	the	right	time	.
now	,	we	 al 	 so 	 	do	some	 pre 	 tty 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	with	these	 phone 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	that	moment	when	you	answer	the	phone	is	a	cognitive	test	every	time	that	you	do	it	.
think	about	it	,	all	right	?	i	'm	going	to	answer	the	phone	three	different	 time 	 s 	 	.
``	 hell 	 o 	 	?	 he 	 y 	 	.	``
all	right	?	that	's	the	first	time	.
``	 hell 	 o 	 	?	uh	,	 he 	 y 	 	.	``
``	 hell 	 o 	 	?	uh	,	who	?
oh	,	 he 	 y 	 	.	``
all	right	?	 ver 	 y 	 	big	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	between	the	way	i	 answer 	 ed 	 	the	phone	the	three	 time 	 s 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	we	monitor	phone	 us 	 age 	 	by	 senior 	 s 	 	over	a	long	period	of	time	,	down	to	the	 tenth 	 s 	 	of	a	 micro 	 second 	 	,	that	 re 	 cognition 	 	moment	of	 whet 	 her 	 	they	can	figure	out	that	person	on	the	other	end	is	a	friend	and	we	start	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	them	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	,	or	they	do	a	lot	of	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	trouble	talk	,	where	they	're	like	,	``	wait	,	who	is	 th 	 is 	 	?	oh	.	``	right	?
 wait 	 ing 	 	for	that	 re 	 cognition 	 	moment	may	be	the	best	early	 indic 	 ator 	 	of	the	 on 	 set 	 	of	 de 	 ment 	 ia 	 	than	 any 	 thing 	 	that	 show 	 s 	 	up	 clinic 	 ally 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
we	call	these	 behavior 	 al 	 	 marker 	 s 	 	.
there	's	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 other 	 s 	 	.	is	the	person	going	to	the	phone	 a 	 s 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	when	it	 ring 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	they	used	to	?
is	it	a	 hear 	 ing 	 	problem	or	is	it	a	 physical 	 ity 	 	problem	?
 ha 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	voice	gotten	more	quiet	?	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	work	with	people	with	alzheimer	's	and	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	with	parkinson	's	,
where	that	quiet	voice	that	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 show 	 s 	 	up	with	parkinson	's	 patient 	 s 	 	may	be	the	best	early	 indic 	 ator 	 	of	parkinson	's	five	to	10	 year 	 s 	 	before	it	 show 	 s 	 	up	 clinic 	 ally 	 	.
but	 t 	 hose 	 	subtle	 change 	 s 	 	in	your	voice	over	a	long	period	of	time	are	hard	for	you	or	your	spouse	to	notice	 un 	 til 	 	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	so	 extrem 	 e 	 	and	your	voice	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	so	quiet	.
so	,	 sensor 	 s 	 	are	looking	at	that	kind	of	voice	.
when	you	pick	up	the	phone	,	how	much	 trem 	 or 	 	are	you	 hav 	 ing 	 	,	and	what	is	that	like	,	and	what	is	that	trend	like	over	a	period	of	time	?
are	you	 hav 	 ing 	 	more	trouble	 dial 	 ing 	 	the	phone	than	you	used	to	?
is	it	a	 dexter 	 ity 	 	problem	?	is	it	the	 on 	 set 	 	of	 art 	 hritis 	 	?
are	you	using	the	phone	?	are	you	 social 	 izing 	 	less	than	you	used	to	?
and	looking	at	that	pattern	.	and	what	 do 	 es 	 	that	decline	in	social	health	mean	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	a	vital	sign	of	the	future	?
and	then	 w 	 ow 	 	,	what	a	radical	idea	,	we	--	 ex 	 cept 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	--	might	be	able	to	use	 th 	 is 	 	 new 	 fang 	 led 	 	technology	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	interact	with	a	nurse	or	a	doctor	on	the	other	end	of	the	line	.
 w 	 ow 	 	,	what	a	great	day	that	will	be	once	we	're	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	 t 	 hose 	 	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
so	,	these	are	what	i	would	call	 behavior 	 al 	 	 marker 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	the	whole	field	that	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	work	on	for	the	last	10	 year 	 s 	 	at	 in 	 tel 	 	.
how	do	you	put	simple	 disrupt 	 ive 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	and	the	first	of	five	 phrase 	 s 	 	that	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	in	 th 	 is 	 	talk	?
 behavior 	 al 	 	 marker 	 s 	 	matter	.
how	do	we	change	behavior	?
how	do	we	measure	 change 	 s 	 	in	behavior	in	a	 meaning 	 ful 	 	way	that	's	going	to	help	us	with	 prevent 	 ion 	 	of	disease	,	early	 on 	 set 	 	of	disease	,	and	 track 	 ing 	 	the	 progress 	 ion 	 	of	disease	over	a	long	period	of	time	?
now	,	why	would	 in 	 tel 	 	let	me	 s 	 pend 	 	a	lot	of	time	and	money	,	over	the	last	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	the	 need 	 s 	 	of	 senior 	 s 	 	and	start	 think 	 ing 	 	about	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 behavior 	 al 	 	 marker 	 s 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	some	of	the	field	work	that	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	.
we	have	now	lived	with	1,000	 elder 	 ly 	 	 house 	 hold 	 s 	 	in	20	 count 	 ries 	 	over	the	last	10	 year 	 s 	 	.
we	 stud 	 y 	 	people	in	rochester	,	new	york	.
we	go	live	with	them	in	the	winter	 be 	 cause 	 	what	they	do	in	the	winter	,	and	 the 	 ir 	 	access	to	 health 	 care 	 	,	and	how	much	they	 social 	 ize 	 	,	is	 ver 	 y 	 	different	than	in	the	summer	.
if	they	have	a	hip	fracture	we	go	with	them	and	we	 stud 	 y 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	entire	 dis 	 charge 	 	experience	.
if	they	have	a	family	member	who	is	a	key	part	of	 the 	 ir 	 	care	network	,	we	fly	and	 stud 	 y 	 	them	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
so	,	we	 stud 	 y 	 	the	 hol 	 istic 	 	health	experience	of	1,000	 senior 	 s 	 	over	the	last	10	 year 	 s 	 	in	20	different	 count 	 ries 	 	.
why	is	 in 	 tel 	 	 will 	 ing 	 	to	fund	that	?
it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	second	slogan	that	i	want	to	talk	about	.	ten	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	when	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 con 	 vince 	 	 in 	 tel 	 	to	let	me	go	start	looking	at	 disrupt 	 ive 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	that	could	help	with	 in 	 dependent 	 	living	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	 call 	 ed 	 	it	:	``	y	2k	+	10.	``	you	know	,	back	in	2000	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	all	so	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	 pay 	 ing 	 	attention	to	the	aging	of	our	 computer 	 s 	 	,	and	 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	they	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	the	tick	of	the	clock	from	1999	to	2000	,	that	we	 mis 	 s 	 ed 	 	a	moment	that	 on 	 ly 	 	 demo 	 graph 	 ers 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 pay 	 ing 	 	attention	to	.
it	was	right	around	new	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	that	 s 	 witch 	 over 	 	,	when	we	had	the	 large 	 r 	 	number	of	 old 	 er 	 	people	on	the	planet	,	for	the	first	time	than	 young 	 er 	 	people	.

and	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	it	 seem 	 ed 	 	like	i	had	a	lot	of	time	to	 con 	 vince 	 	 in 	 tel 	 	to	work	on	 th 	 is 	 	.	right	?
y	2k	+	10	was	coming	,	the	baby	 boom 	 ers 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	to	retire	.
well	 folk 	 s 	 	,	it	's	like	we	know	these	 demo 	 graphic 	 s 	 	here	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	map	of	the	entire	world	.	it	's	like	the	 light 	 s 	 	are	on	,	but	 no 	 body 	 	's	home	on	 th 	 is 	 	 demo 	 graphic 	 	y	2k	+	10	problem	.	right	?
i	mean	we	sort	of	get	it	here	,	but	we	do	n't	get	it	here	,
and	we	're	not	 do 	 ing 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	about	it	.
the	health	reform	bill	is	 large 	 ly 	 	 ignor 	 ing 	 	the	 real 	 ities 	 	of	the	age	wave	that	's	coming	,	and	the	 implic 	 ations 	 	for	what	we	need	to	do	to	change	not	 on 	 ly 	 	how	we	pay	for	care	,	but	deliver	care	in	some	 radical 	 ly 	 	different	ways	.
and	in	fact	,	it	's	 up 	 on 	 	us	.
i	mean	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	saw	these	 head 	 lines 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	catherine	casey	who	is	the	first	 boom 	 er 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	social	security	.
that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 occur 	 red 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	.	she	took	early	 retire 	 ment 	 	.
she	was	born	one	second	after	 mid 	 night 	 	in	1946	.
a	 retire 	 d 	 	school	teacher	,

the	first	 boom 	 er 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	we	did	n't	even	wait	till	2011	,	next	year	.
we	're	 al 	 ready 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	to	see	early	 retire 	 ment 	 	occur	 th 	 is 	 	year	.
all	right	,	so	it	's	here	.	 th 	 is 	 	y	2k	+	10	problem	is	at	our	door	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	50	 tsunami 	 s 	 	 schedule 	 d 	 	on	the	calendar	,
but	 some 	 how 	 	we	ca	n't	sort	of	 marsh 	 al 	 	our	government	and	 innov 	 ative 	 	 force 	 s 	 	to	sort	of	get	out	in	front	of	it	and	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	it	.	we	'll	wait	 un 	 til 	 	it	's	more	of	a	 catastroph 	 e 	 	,	and	react	,	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	 prep 	 are 	 	for	it	.
so	,	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	it	's	so	 challeng 	 ing 	 	to	 prep 	 are 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	y	2k	problem	is	,	i	want	to	 argu 	 e 	 	,	we	have	what	i	would	call	 main 	 frame 	 	 poison 	 ing 	 	.
andy	grove	,	about	six	or	seven	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	even	know	or	remember	 th 	 is 	 	,	in	a	fortune	magazine	article	he	used	the	phrase	``	 main 	 frame 	 	 health 	 care 	 	,	``	and	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 extend 	 ing 	 	and	 expand 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.

i	just	 extend 	 ed 	 	it	.	``
you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 main 	 frame 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 ment 	 ality 	 	of	 travel 	 ing 	 	to	and	 time 	 sharing 	 	large	,	expensive	 health 	 care 	 	 system 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	in	1787	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	general	hospital	in	vienna	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	second	general	hospital	in	vienna	,	in	about	1850	,	was	where	we	 start 	 ed 	 	to	build	out	an	entire	curriculum	for	 teach 	 ing 	 	med	 student 	 s 	 	 special 	 ties 	 	.
and	it	's	a	place	in	which	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 develop 	 ing 	 	 architect 	 ure 	 	that	 liter 	 ally 	 	 divid 	 ed 	 	the	body	,	and	 divid 	 ed 	 	care	 in 	 to 	 	 depart 	 ments 	 	and	 compartment 	 s 	 	.
and	it	was	 reflect 	 ed 	 	in	our	 architect 	 ure 	 	,
it	was	 reflect 	 ed 	 	in	the	way	that	we	taught	 student 	 s 	 	,
and	 th 	 is 	 	 main 	 frame 	 	 ment 	 ality 	 	 persist 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
now	,	i	'm	not	anti	-	hospital	.
with	my	own	 health 	 care 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	,	i	've	taken	drug	 ther 	 a 	 pies 	 	,	i	've	 travel 	 ed 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	hospital	and	 other 	 s 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	.
but	we	worship	the	high	hospital	on	a	hill	.	right	?
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 main 	 frame 	 	 health 	 care 	 	.
and	just	 a 	 s 	 	30	 year 	 s 	 	ago	we	could	n't	 conceiv 	 e 	 	that	we	would	have	the	power	of	a	 main 	 frame 	 	computer	that	took	up	a	room	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 ize 	 	in	our	 pur 	 s 	 es 	 	and	on	our	 belt 	 s 	 	,	that	we	're	 carry 	 ing 	 	around	in	our	cell	phone	 to 	 day 	 	,
and	 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	computing	,	that	used	to	be	an	expert	driven	system	,	it	was	a	personal	system	that	we	all	owned	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	our	 dai 	 ly 	 	 live 	 s 	 	--
that	shift	from	 main 	 frame 	 	to	personal	computing	is	what	we	have	to	do	for	 health 	 care 	 	.
we	have	to	shift	from	 th 	 is 	 	 main 	 frame 	 	 ment 	 ality 	 	of	 health 	 care 	 	to	a	personal	model	of	 health 	 care 	 	.
we	are	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	way	of	 think 	 ing 	 	.
when	 in 	 tel 	 	 do 	 es 	 	 survey 	 s 	 	all	around	the	world	and	we	say	,	``	quick	 respons 	 e 	 	:	 health 	 care 	 	.	``	the	first	word	that	 come 	 s 	 	up	is	``	doctor	.	``
the	second	that	 come 	 s 	 	up	is	``	hospital	.	``	and	the	third	is	``	 ill 	 ness 	 	``	or	``	 sick 	 ness 	 	.	``	right	?
we	are	wired	,	in	our	 imagin 	 ation 	 	,	to	think	about	 health 	 care 	 	and	 health 	 care 	 	 innov 	 ation 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	that	place	.
our	entire	health	reform	 discuss 	 ion 	 	right	now	,	health	i.t	.	,	when	we	talk	with	policy	makers	,	 equal 	 s 	 	``	how	are	we	going	to	get	 doctor 	 s 	 	using	 electron 	 ic 	 	medical	 record 	 s 	 	in	the	 main 	 frame 	 	?	``
we	're	not	 think 	 ing 	 	about	how	do	we	shift	from	the	 main 	 frame 	 	to	the	home	.
and	the	problem	with	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	way	we	 conceiv 	 e 	 	 health 	 care 	 	.	right	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 re 	 active 	 	,	crisis	-	driven	system	.
we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	15	-	minute	 ex 	 am 	 s 	 	with	 patient 	 s 	 	.
it	's	population	-	based	.
we	collect	a	bunch	of	 bio 	 logical 	 	information	in	 th 	 is 	 	artificial	setting	,
and	we	fix	them	up	,	like	 hump 	 ty 	 	-	 dump 	 ty 	 	all	over	 aga 	 in 	 	,	and	 s 	 end 	 	them	home	,	and	hope	--	we	might	hand	them	a	brochure	,	 may 	 be 	 	an	 inter 	 active 	 	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	--	that	they	do	 a 	 s 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	and	do	n't	come	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	 main 	 frame 	 	.
and	the	problem	is	we	ca	n't	afford	it	 to 	 day 	 	,	 folk 	 s 	 	.
we	ca	n't	afford	 main 	 frame 	 	 health 	 care 	 	 to 	 day 	 	to	include	the	 un 	 insur 	 ed 	 	.
and	now	we	want	to	do	a	double	-	double	of	the	age	wave	coming	through	?
business	 a 	 s 	 	usual	in	 health 	 care 	 	is	broken	and	we	've	got	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	different	.
we	've	got	to	focus	on	the	home	.
we	've	got	to	focus	on	a	personal	 health 	 care 	 	paradigm	that	 move 	 s 	 	care	to	the	home	.	how	do	we	be	more	 pro 	 active 	 	,	 prevent 	 ion 	 	-	driven	?
how	do	we	collect	vital	 sign 	 s 	 	and	other	 kind 	 s 	 	of	information	24	by	7	?
how	do	we	get	a	personal	 base 	 line 	 	about	what	's	going	to	work	for	you	?
how	do	we	collect	not	just	 bio 	 logical 	 	data	but	 behavior 	 al 	 	data	,	 psycho 	 logical 	 	data	,	 relation 	 al 	 	data	,	in	and	on	and	around	the	home	?

now	,	the	most	 frighten 	 ing 	 	thing	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	wife	's	 grand 	 mother 	 	.
now	,	i	'm	eric	dishman	.	i	speak	english	,
i	work	for	 in 	 tel 	 	,	i	make	a	good	 s 	 al 	 ary 	 	,
i	'm	smart	about	 fall 	 s 	 	and	fall	-	related	 inju 	 ries 	 	--
it	's	an	area	of	research	that	i	work	on	.
i	have	access	to	 senator 	 s 	 	and	ceos	.
i	ca	n't	stop	 th 	 is 	 	from	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
what	 happen 	 s 	 	if	you	do	n't	have	money	,	you	do	n't	speak	english	or	do	n't	have	the	kind	of	access	to	deal	with	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 problem 	 s 	 	that	 inevit 	 ably 	 	occur	?
how	do	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	prevent	the	vast	 major 	 ity 	 	of	 fall 	 s 	 	from	ever	 occur 	 ring 	 	in	the	first	place	?
let	me	give	you	a	quick	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	work	that	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	to	try	to	do	 exact 	 ly 	 	that	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 wear 	 ing 	 	a	little	technology	that	we	call	shimmer	.
it	's	a	research	platform	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	 accele 	 ro 	 metry 	 	.	you	can	plug	in	a	three	-	lead	ecg	.
there	is	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	sort	of	plug	-	and	-	play	kind	of	legos	that	you	can	do	to	capture	,	in	the	wild	,	in	the	real	world	,	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 trem 	 or 	 	,	 ga 	 it 	 	,	 strid 	 e 	 	length	and	 t 	 hose 	 	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
the	problem	is	,	our	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	 fall 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	like	 mim 	 i 	 	,	is	get	a	survey	in	the	mail	three	 month 	 s 	 	after	you	fell	,
from	the	state	,	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	what	 we 	 re 	 	you	 do 	 ing 	 	when	you	fell	?	``
that	's	sort	of	the	state	of	the	art	.
but	with	 some 	 thing 	 	like	shimmer	,	or	we	have	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	magic	carpet	,	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	 sensor 	 s 	 	in	carpet	,	or	camera	-	based	 system 	 s 	 	that	we	 borrow 	 ed 	 	from	 s 	 port 	 s 	 	medicine	,	we	're	 start 	 ing 	 	for	the	first	time	in	 t 	 hose 	 	600	 elder 	 ly 	 	 house 	 hold 	 s 	 	to	collect	actual	kinematic	motion	data	to	understand	:	what	are	the	subtle	 change 	 s 	 	that	are	 occur 	 ring 	 	that	can	show	us	that	mom	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	risk	at	 fall 	 s 	 	?
and	most	often	we	can	do	two	 intervention 	 s 	 	,	fix	the	 med 	 s 	 	mix	.
i	'm	a	 qual 	 itative 	 	 research 	 er 	 	,	but	when	i	look	at	these	data	 stream 	 s 	 	coming	in	from	these	 home 	 s 	 	,	i	can	look	at	the	data	and	tell	you	the	day	that	some	doctor	 pre 	 scribed 	 	them	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 no 	 body 	 	else	 k 	 new 	 	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	on	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	see	the	 change 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	in	the	 house 	 hold 	 	.	right	?
these	 discover 	 ies 	 	of	 behavior 	 al 	 	 marker 	 s 	 	,	and	 behavior 	 al 	 	 change 	 s 	 	are	game	changing	,	and	like	the	 discover 	 y 	 	of	the	 micro 	 scope 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	our	 collect 	 ing 	 	data	 stream 	 s 	 	that	we	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	never	 d 	 one 	 	before	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	in	our	tril	clinic	in	ireland	of	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	what	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	is	she	's	looking	at	data	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	picture	,	from	the	magic	carpet	.
so	,	we	have	a	little	carpet	that	you	can	look	at	your	amount	of	 post 	 ural 	 	 s 	 way 	 	,	and	look	at	the	 change 	 s 	 	in	your	 post 	 ural 	 	 s 	 way 	 	over	 man 	 y 	 	 month 	 s 	 	.
here	's	what	some	of	 th 	 is 	 	data	might	look	like	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	sensor	 fir 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
these	are	two	different	 subject 	 s 	 	in	our	 stud 	 y 	 	.
it	's	about	a	year	's	worth	of	data	.
the	color	 represent 	 s 	 	different	rooms	they	are	in	the	house	.
 th 	 is 	 	person	on	the	left	is	living	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	home	.
 th 	 is 	 	person	on	the	right	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	living	in	an	 assist 	 ed 	 	living	 facil 	 ity 	 	.
i	know	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	look	at	how	 punctu 	 ated 	 	meal	time	is	when	they	are	no	 long 	 er 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	rooms	here	.	right	?
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	that	much	to	you	.
but	when	we	look	at	these	 cycle 	 s 	 	of	data	over	a	 long 	 er 	 	period	of	time	--	and	we	're	looking	at	 every 	 thing 	 	from	motion	around	different	rooms	in	the	house	,	to	sort	of	micro	-	 motion 	 s 	 	that	shimmer	 pick 	 s 	 	up	,	about	 ga 	 it 	 	and	 strid 	 e 	 	length	--	these	 stream 	 s 	 	of	data	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	tell	us	 thing 	 s 	 	about	 behavior 	 al 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	that	we	've	never	 under 	 stood 	 	before	.
you	can	go	to	orcatech.org	--	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	 whale 	 s 	 	,	it	's	the	oregon	center	for	aging	and	technology	--
to	see	more	about	that	.
the	problem	is	,	 in 	 tel 	 	is	still	one	of	the	largest	 fund 	 ers 	 	in	the	world	of	 in 	 dependent 	 	living	technology	research	.
i	'm	not	 brag 	 ging 	 	about	how	much	we	fund	;	it	's	how	little	 any 	 one 	 	else	 actual 	 ly 	 	 pay 	 s 	 	attention	to	aging	and	 fund 	 s 	 	 innov 	 ation 	 	on	aging	,	chronic	disease	management	and	 in 	 dependent 	 	living	in	the	home	.
so	,	my	 man 	 tra 	 	here	,	my	fourth	slogan	is	:	10,000	 house 	 hold 	 s 	 	or	bust	.
we	need	to	drive	a	national	,	if	not	 inter 	 national 	 	,	framingham	-	type	heart	 stud 	 y 	 	of	 in 	 dependent 	 	living	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	where	we	have	10,000	 elder 	 ly 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	 house 	 hold 	 s 	 	with	 broad 	 band 	 	,	full	medical	 character 	 ization 	 	,	and	a	platform	by	which	we	can	start	to	experiment	and	turn	these	from	20	-	 house 	 hold 	 	anecdotal	 stud 	 ies 	 	that	the	 un 	 ive 	 rs 	 ities 	 	fund	,	to	large	 clinic 	 al 	 	 trial 	 s 	 	that	prove	out	the	value	of	these	 techno 	 logies 	 	.
so	,	10,000	 house 	 hold 	 s 	 	or	bust	.
these	are	just	some	of	the	 house 	 hold 	 s 	 	that	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	in	the	 in 	 tel 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	.
my	fifth	and	final	phrase	:	i	have	 tri 	 ed 	 	for	two	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	there	 we 	 re 	 	 moment 	 s 	 	when	we	 we 	 re 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	close	,	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	 health 	 care 	 	reform	bill	be	about	reform	from	 some 	 thing 	 	and	to	 some 	 thing 	 	,
from	a	 main 	 frame 	 	model	to	a	personal	health	model	,	or	to	mean	 some 	 thing 	 	more	than	just	a	debate	about	the	public	option	and	how	we	're	going	to	finance	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	how	we	finance	 health 	 care 	 	.
we	're	going	to	figure	 some 	 thing 	 	out	for	the	next	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	try	it	.
no	matter	who	 pay 	 s 	 	for	it	,	we	better	start	 do 	 ing 	 	care	in	a	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	different	way	and	 treat 	 ing 	 	the	home	and	the	patient	and	the	family	member	and	the	 care 	 giver 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	these	 coordinate 	 d 	 	care	 team 	 s 	 
and	using	 disrupt 	 ive 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	that	are	 al 	 ready 	 	here	to	do	care	in	some	 pre 	 tty 	 	fundamental	different	ways	.
the	 p 	 resident 	 	 need 	 s 	 	to	stand	up	and	say	,	at	the	end	of	a	 health 	 care 	 	reform	debate	,	``	our	goal	 a 	 s 	 	a	country	is	to	move	50	percent	of	care	out	of	 institution 	 s 	 	,	 clinic 	 s 	 	,	 hospital 	 s 	 	and	 nurs 	 ing 	 	 home 	 s 	 	,	to	the	home	,	in	10	 year 	 s 	 	.	``
it	's	 achiev 	 able 	 	.	we	should	do	it	 economic 	 ally 	 	,
we	should	do	it	 moral 	 ly 	 	,
and	we	should	do	it	for	quality	of	life	.
but	there	is	no	goal	 with 	 in 	 	 th 	 is 	 	health	reform	.
it	's	just	a	mess	 to 	 day 	 	.
so	,	you	know	,	that	's	my	last	 mess 	 age 	 	to	you	.
how	do	we	set	a	going	-	to	-	the	-	moon	goal	of	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	the	y	2k	+	10	problem	that	's	coming	?
it	's	not	that	 innov 	 ation 	 	and	technology	is	going	to	be	the	magic	pill	that	 cure 	 s 	 	all	,	but	it	's	going	to	be	part	of	the	solution	.
and	if	we	do	n't	create	a	personal	health	 move 	 ment 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	're	all	 aim 	 ing 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	in	reform	,	then	we	're	going	to	move	 no 	 where 	 	.
so	,	i	hope	you	'll	turn	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	 in 	 to 	 	that	kind	of	 move 	 ment 	 	forward	.
 thank 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
