 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	now	i	do	n't	want	to	alarm	 any 	 body 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	but	it	's	just	come	to	my	attention	that	the	person	to	your	right	is	a	liar	.
 al 	 so 	 	,	the	person	to	your	left	is	a	liar	.
 al 	 so 	 	the	person	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	your	 ver 	 y 	 	 seat 	 s 	 	is	a	liar	.
we	're	all	 liar 	 s 	 	.
what	i	'm	going	to	do	 to 	 day 	 	is	i	'm	going	to	show	you	what	the	research	 say 	 s 	 	about	why	we	're	all	 liar 	 s 	 	,	how	you	can	 be 	 come 	 	a	 lies 	 potter 	 	and	why	you	might	want	to	go	the	extra	mile	and	go	from	 lies 	 pot 	 ting 	 	to	truth	seeking	,	and	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	to	trust	building	.
now	 s 	 peaking 	 	of	trust	,	ever	since	i	wrote	 th 	 is 	 	book	,	``	 lies 	 pot 	 ting 	 	,	``	no	one	 want 	 s 	 	to	meet	me	in	person	 any 	 more 	 	,	no	,	no	,	no	,	no	,	no	.
they	say	,	``	it	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	we	'll	email	you	.	``
i	ca	n't	even	get	a	coffee	date	at	starbucks	.
my	husband	's	like	,	``	honey	,	 de 	 ception 	 	?

so	before	i	get	 start 	 ed 	 	,	what	i	'm	going	to	do	is	i	'm	going	to	 clar 	 ify 	 	my	goal	for	you	,	which	is	not	to	teach	a	game	of	gotcha	.

no	,	 lies 	 potter 	 s 	 	are	 arm 	 ed 	 	with	scientific	knowledge	of	how	to	spot	 de 	 ception 	 	.
they	use	it	to	get	to	the	truth	,	and	they	do	what	mature	 lead 	 ers 	 	do	 every 	 day 	 	;	they	have	difficult	 conversation 	 s 	 	with	difficult	people	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	 time 	 s 	 	.
and	they	start	up	that	path	by	 accept 	 ing 	 	a	core	 pro 	 position 	 	,	and	that	 pro 	 position 	 	is	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	:	 ly 	 ing 	 	is	a	 co 	 operative 	 	act	.

 some 	 time 	 s 	 	we	're	 will 	 ing 	 	 particip 	 ants 	 	in	 de 	 ception 	 	for	the	sake	of	social	dignity	,	 may 	 be 	 	to	keep	a	secret	that	should	be	 ke 	 pt 	 	secret	,	secret	.
we	say	,	``	nice	song	.	``

freud	had	it	right	.
freud	 s 	 aid 	 	,	look	,	there	's	much	more	to	it	than	speech	:	``	no	mortal	can	keep	a	secret	.

and	we	all	do	it	no	matter	how	 power 	 ful 	 	you	are	.

now	 th 	 is 	 	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	us	to	our	next	pattern	,	which	is	body	language	.
with	body	language	,	here	's	what	you	've	got	to	do	.
you	've	 re 	 ally 	 	got	to	just	throw	your	 assumption 	 s 	 	out	the	door	.
let	the	science	temper	your	knowledge	a	little	bit	.	 be 	 cause 	 	we	think	 liar 	 s 	 	fidget	all	the	time	.
well	guess	what	,	they	're	known	to	freeze	 the 	 ir 	 	upper	bodies	when	they	're	 ly 	 ing 	 	.
we	think	 liar 	 s 	 	wo	n't	look	you	in	the	 eye 	 s 	 	.
well	guess	what	,	they	look	you	in	the	 eye 	 s 	 	a	little	too	much	just	to	 compens 	 ate 	 	for	that	myth	.
we	think	 warm 	 th 	 	and	 s 	 mile 	 s 	 	convey	 honest 	 y 	 	,	 since 	 r 	 ity 	 	.
but	a	trained	 lies 	 potter 	 	can	spot	a	fake	 s 	 mile 	 	a	mile	away	.
can	you	all	spot	the	fake	 s 	 mile 	 	here	?
you	can	 conscious 	 ly 	 	contract	the	 muscle 	 s 	 	in	your	 cheek 	 s 	 	.
but	the	real	 s 	 mile 	 	's	in	the	 eye 	 s 	 	,	the	crow	's	feet	of	the	 eye 	 s 	 	.
they	can	not	be	 conscious 	 ly 	 	 contract 	 ed 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	if	you	 over 	 did 	 	the	botox	.
do	n't	 over 	 do 	 	the	botox	;	 no 	 body 	 	will	think	you	're	honest	.
now	we	're	going	to	look	at	the	hot	 spot 	 s 	 	.
can	you	tell	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	a	conversation	?
can	you	start	to	find	the	hot	 spot 	 s 	 	to	see	the	 discrep 	 ancies 	 	between	 some 	 one 	 	's	 word 	 s 	 	and	 some 	 one 	 	's	 action 	 s 	 	?
now	i	know	it	 seem 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	obvious	,	but	when	you	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	conversation	with	 some 	 one 	 	you	suspect	of	 de 	 ception 	 	,	attitude	is	by	far	the	most	 overlook 	 ed 	 	but	 tell 	 ing 	 	of	 indic 	 ators 	 	.
an	honest	person	is	going	to	be	 co 	 operative 	 	.
they	're	going	to	show	they	're	on	your	side	.
they	're	going	to	be	 enthusiast 	 ic 	 	.
they	're	going	to	be	 will 	 ing 	 	and	 help 	 ful 	 	to	 get 	 ting 	 	you	to	the	truth	.
they	're	going	to	be	 will 	 ing 	 	to	 brain 	 storm 	 	,	name	 suspect 	 s 	 	,	provide	 detail 	 s 	 	.
they	're	going	to	say	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	it	was	 t 	 hose 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	in	 pay 	 roll 	 	that	 for 	 ged 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 check 	 s 	 	.	``
they	're	going	to	be	 infuri 	 ated 	 	if	they	sense	they	're	 wrong 	 ly 	 	 accus 	 ed 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	entire	course	of	the	interview	,	not	just	in	 flash 	 es 	 	;	they	'll	be	 infuri 	 ated 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	entire	course	of	the	interview	.
and	if	you	ask	 some 	 one 	 	honest	what	should	happen	to	 whom 	 ever 	 	did	 for 	 ge 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 check 	 s 	 	,	an	honest	person	is	much	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	recommend	strict	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 len 	 ient 	 	 punish 	 ment 	 	.
now	let	's	say	you	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	that	exact	same	conversation	with	 some 	 one 	 	deceptive	.
that	person	may	be	 withdraw 	 n 	 	,	look	down	,	lower	 the 	 ir 	 	voice	,	pause	,	be	kind	of	herky	-	 jerk 	 y 	 	.
ask	a	deceptive	person	to	tell	 the 	 ir 	 	story	,	they	're	going	to	pepper	it	with	way	too	much	detail	in	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 ir 	 relevant 	 	 place 	 s 	 	.
and	then	they	're	going	to	tell	 the 	 ir 	 	story	in	strict	 chrono 	 logical 	 	order	.
and	what	a	trained	 interrog 	 ator 	 	 do 	 es 	 	is	they	come	in	and	in	 ver 	 y 	 	subtle	ways	over	the	course	of	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 hour 	 s 	 	,	they	will	ask	that	person	to	tell	that	story	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	and	then	they	'll	watch	them	squirm	,	and	track	which	 question 	 s 	 	produce	the	highest	volume	of	deceptive	 tell 	 s 	 	.
why	do	they	do	that	?	well	we	all	do	the	same	thing	.
we	 rehears 	 e 	 	our	 word 	 s 	 	,	but	we	 rare 	 ly 	 	 rehears 	 e 	 	our	 gest 	 ures 	 	.
we	say	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	``	we	shake	our	 head 	 s 	 	``	no.	``
we	tell	 ver 	 y 	 	convincing	 st 	 ories 	 	,	we	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	shrug	our	 shoulder 	 s 	 	.

so	i	know	it	's	not	possible	.
happy	to	take	a	 patern 	 ity 	 	test	,	and	would	love	to	see	it	happen	.
 interview 	 er 	 	:	are	you	going	to	do	that	soon	?	is	there	 some 	 body 	 	--
je	:	well	,	i	'm	 on 	 ly 	 	one	side	.	i	'm	 on 	 ly 	 	one	side	of	the	test	.
but	i	'm	happy	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	in	one	.
pm	:	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	head	 shake 	 s 	 	are	much	 eas 	 ier 	 	to	spot	once	you	know	to	look	for	them	.
there	're	going	to	be	 time 	 s 	 	when	 some 	 one 	 	 make 	 s 	 	one	 express 	 ion 	 	while	 mask 	 ing 	 	 an 	 other 	 	that	just	kind	of	 leak 	 s 	 	through	in	a	flash	.
 murder 	 ers 	 	are	known	to	leak	 s 	 ad 	 ness 	 	.
your	new	joint	venture	partner	might	shake	your	hand	,	 celebr 	 ate 	 	,	go	out	to	 d 	 inner 	 	with	you	and	then	leak	an	 express 	 ion 	 	of	anger	.
and	we	're	not	all	going	to	 be 	 come 	 	 fa 	 cial 	 	 express 	 ion 	 	 expert 	 s 	 	 over 	 night 	 	here	,	but	there	's	one	i	can	teach	you	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	,	and	it	's	easy	to	learn	,	and	that	's	the	 express 	 ion 	 	of	 con 	 tempt 	 	.
now	with	anger	,	you	've	got	two	people	on	an	even	 play 	 ing 	 	field	.
it	's	still	 some 	 what 	 	of	a	 health 	 y 	 	relationship	.
but	when	anger	 turn 	 s 	 	to	 con 	 tempt 	 	,	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	 dismiss 	 ed 	 	.
it	's	 associate 	 d 	 	with	moral	 super 	 ior 	 ity 	 	.
and	for	that	reason	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	 re 	 cover 	 	from	.
here	's	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
it	's	 mark 	 ed 	 	by	one	lip	corner	 pull 	 ed 	 	up	and	in	.
it	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 a 	 symmetric 	 al 	 	 express 	 ion 	 	.
and	in	the	presence	of	 con 	 tempt 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	 de 	 ception 	 	 follow 	 s 	 	--	and	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	follow	--	look	the	other	way	,	go	the	other	direction	,	 re 	 consider 	 	the	deal	,	say	,	``	no	thank	you	.	i	'm	not	coming	up	for	just	one	more	 night 	 cap 	 	.	thank	you	.	``
science	 ha 	 s 	 	 surface 	 d 	 	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	more	 indic 	 ators 	 	.
we	know	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	we	know	 liar 	 s 	 	will	shift	 the 	 ir 	 	blink	rate	,	point	 the 	 ir 	 	feet	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	an	exit	.
they	will	take	 bar 	 rier 	 	 object 	 s 	 	and	put	them	between	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	the	person	that	is	 interview 	 ing 	 	them	.
they	'll	alter	 the 	 ir 	 	vocal	tone	,	often	making	 the 	 ir 	 	vocal	tone	much	lower	.
now	here	's	the	deal	.
these	 behavior 	 s 	 	are	just	 behavior 	 s 	 	.
they	're	not	proof	of	 de 	 ception 	 	.
they	're	red	 flag 	 s 	 	.
we	're	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
we	make	deceptive	 fl 	 ailing 	 	 gest 	 ures 	 	all	over	the	place	all	day	long	.
they	do	n't	mean	 any 	 thing 	 	in	and	of	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
but	when	you	see	 cluster 	 s 	 	of	them	,	that	's	your	signal	.
look	,	listen	,	 prob 	 e 	 	,	ask	some	hard	 question 	 s 	 	,	get	out	of	that	 ver 	 y 	 	 comfort 	 able 	 	mode	of	 know 	 ing 	 	,	walk	 in 	 to 	 	curiosity	mode	,	ask	more	 question 	 s 	 	,	have	a	little	dignity	,	treat	the	person	you	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	with	 rap 	 port 	 	.
do	n't	try	to	be	like	 t 	 hose 	 	 folk 	 s 	 	on	``	law	&	order	``	and	 t 	 hose 	 	other	tv	 show 	 s 	 	that	 pum 	 mel 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 subject 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 sub 	 mission 	 	.
do	n't	be	too	 aggress 	 ive 	 	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	.
now	we	've	 talk 	 ed 	 	a	little	bit	about	how	to	talk	to	 some 	 one 	 	who	's	 ly 	 ing 	 	and	how	to	spot	a	lie	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	 promise 	 d 	 	,	we	're	now	going	to	look	at	what	the	truth	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
but	i	'm	going	to	show	you	two	 video 	 s 	 	,	two	 mother 	 s 	 	--	one	is	 ly 	 ing 	 	,	one	is	 tell 	 ing 	 	the	truth	.
and	these	 we 	 re 	 	 surface 	 d 	 	by	 research 	 er 	 	david	matsumoto	in	california	.
and	i	think	they	're	an	 excel 	 lent 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	what	the	truth	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
 th 	 is 	 	mother	,	diane	 down 	 s 	 	,	shot	her	 kid 	 s 	 	at	close	range	,	drove	them	to	the	hospital	while	they	bled	all	over	the	car	,	 claim 	 ed 	 	a	scraggy	-	haired	 strange 	 r 	 	did	it	.
and	you	'll	see	when	you	see	the	video	,	she	ca	n't	even	pretend	to	be	an	 agon 	 izing 	 	mother	.
what	you	want	to	look	for	here	is	an	 in 	 credible 	 	 discrep 	 ancy 	 	between	 horr 	 ific 	 	 event 	 s 	 	that	she	 de 	 scribe 	 s 	 	and	her	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	cool	demeanor	.
and	if	you	look	 close 	 ly 	 	,	you	'll	see	 d 	 up 	 ing 	 	 de 	 light 	 	 through 	 out 	 	 th 	 is 	 	video	.
diane	 down 	 s 	 	:	at	night	when	i	close	my	 eye 	 s 	 	,	i	can	see	christie	 reach 	 ing 	 	her	hand	out	to	me	while	i	'm	 driv 	 ing 	 	,	and	the	blood	just	 ke 	 pt 	 	coming	out	of	her	mouth	.
and	that	--	 may 	 be 	 	it	'll	 fad 	 e 	 	too	with	time	--	but	i	do	n't	think	so	.
that	 both 	 ers 	 	me	the	most	.
pm	:	now	i	'm	going	to	show	you	a	video	of	an	actual	 griev 	 ing 	 	mother	,	erin	runnion	,	 confront 	 ing 	 	her	daughter	's	 murder 	 er 	 	and	 torture 	 r 	 	in	court	.
here	you	're	going	to	see	no	false	emotion	,	just	the	authentic	 express 	 ion 	 	of	a	mother	's	 agon 	 y 	 	.
erin	runnion	:	i	wrote	 th 	 is 	 	 state 	 ment 	 	on	the	third	 annivers 	 ary 	 	of	the	night	you	took	my	baby	,	and	you	hurt	her	,	and	you	 crush 	 ed 	 	her	,	you	 terr 	 ified 	 	her	 un 	 til 	 	her	heart	 stop 	 ped 	 	.
and	she	 f 	 ought 	 	,	and	i	know	she	 f 	 ought 	 	you	.
but	i	know	she	 look 	 ed 	 	at	you	with	 t 	 hose 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 brow 	 n 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	,	and	you	still	 want 	 ed 	 	to	kill	her	.
and	i	do	n't	understand	it	,	and	i	never	will	.
pm	:	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	there	's	no	 doubt 	 ing 	 	the	 ver 	 a 	 city 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 emotion 	 s 	 	.
now	the	technology	around	what	the	truth	 look 	 s 	 	like	is	 progress 	 ing 	 	on	,	the	science	of	it	.
we	know	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	that	we	now	have	 special 	 ized 	 	eye	 track 	 ers 	 	and	 infra 	 red 	 	brain	 s 	 can 	 s 	 	,	mri	's	that	can	decode	the	 signal 	 s 	 	that	our	bodies	 s 	 end 	 	out	when	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	be	deceptive	.
and	these	 techno 	 logies 	 	are	going	to	be	 market 	 ed 	 	to	all	of	us	 a 	 s 	 	 panacea 	 s 	 	for	deceit	,	and	they	will	prove	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	some	day	.
but	you	've	got	to	ask	 your 	 self 	 	in	the	 mean 	 time 	 	:	who	do	you	want	on	your	side	of	the	 meet 	 ing 	 	,	 some 	 one 	 	who	's	trained	in	 get 	 ting 	 	to	the	truth	or	some	guy	who	's	going	to	drag	a	400	-	pound	 electro 	 encephalo 	 gram 	 	through	the	door	?
 lies 	 potter 	 s 	 	 re 	 ly 	 	on	human	 tool 	 s 	 	.
they	know	,	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 one 	 	once	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	character	's	who	you	are	in	the	dark	.	``
and	what	's	kind	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	that	 to 	 day 	 	we	have	so	little	 dark 	 ness 	 	.
our	world	is	lit	up	24	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	.
it	's	 trans 	 parent 	 
with	 blog 	 s 	 	and	social	 network 	 s 	 	 broad 	 cast 	 ing 	 	the	buzz	of	a	whole	new	generation	of	people	that	have	made	a	choice	to	live	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	in	public	.
it	's	a	much	more	noisy	world	.
so	one	 challeng 	 e 	 	we	have	is	to	remember	,	 over 	 sharing 	 	,	that	's	not	 honest 	 y 	 	.
our	 man 	 ic 	 	 tweet 	 ing 	 	and	 text 	 ing 	 	can	blind	us	to	the	fact	that	the	 subtle 	 ties 	 	of	human	 de 	 cency 	 	--	character	 integ 	 r 	 ity 	 	--	that	's	still	what	 matter 	 s 	 	,	that	's	 al 	 ways 	 	what	's	going	to	matter	.
so	in	 th 	 is 	 	much	noisier	world	,	it	might	make	sense	for	us	to	be	just	a	little	bit	more	 ex 	 plicit 	 	about	our	moral	code	.
when	you	combine	the	science	of	 recogn 	 izing 	 	 de 	 ception 	 	with	the	art	of	looking	,	 listen 	 ing 	 	,	you	exempt	 your 	 self 	 	from	 collabor 	 ating 	 	in	a	lie	.
you	start	up	that	path	of	 be 	 ing 	 	just	a	little	bit	more	 ex 	 plicit 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	signal	to	 every 	 one 	 	around	you	,	you	say	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	my	world	,	our	world	,	it	's	going	to	be	an	honest	one	.
my	world	is	going	to	be	one	where	truth	is	 strength 	 ened 	 	and	 false 	 hood 	 	is	 recogn 	 ized 	 	and	 marginal 	 ized 	 	.	``
and	when	you	do	that	,	the	ground	around	you	 start 	 s 	 	to	shift	just	a	little	bit	.
and	that	's	the	truth	.	thank	you	.
