i	'm	going	to	talk	about	your	 mind 	 set 	 	.
 do 	 es 	 	your	 mind 	 set 	 	correspond	to	my	 data 	 set 	 	?
if	not	,	one	or	the	other	 need 	 s 	 	 up 	 grad 	 ing 	 	,	is	n't	it	?
when	i	talk	to	my	 student 	 s 	 	about	global	 issue 	 s 	 	,	and	i	listen	to	them	in	the	coffee	break	,	they	 al 	 ways 	 	talk	about	``	we	``	and	``	them	.	``
and	when	they	come	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	 lectur 	 e 	 	room	i	ask	them	,	``	what	do	you	mean	with	``	we	``	and	``	them	``	?
``	oh	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	.	it	's	the	western	world	and	it	's	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	,	``	they	say	.
``	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	it	in	college	.	``	and	what	is	the	definition	then	?	``	the	definition	?
 every 	 one 	 	 know 	 s 	 	,	``	they	say	.
but	then	you	know	,	i	press	them	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	one	girl	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 clever 	 ly 	 	,	``	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	.
western	world	is	a	long	life	in	a	small	family	.
 develop 	 ing 	 	world	is	a	short	life	in	a	large	family	.	``	and	i	like	that	definition	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	enabled	me	to	transfer	 the 	 ir 	 	 mind 	 set 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 data 	 set 	 	.
and	here	you	have	the	 data 	 set 	 	.
so	,	you	can	see	that	what	we	have	on	 th 	 is 	 	axis	here	is	 s 	 ize 	 	of	family	.	one	,	two	,	three	,	four	,	five	children	per	woman	on	 th 	 is 	 	axis	.
and	here	,	length	of	life	,	life	 expect 	 ancy 	 	,	30	,	40	,	50	.
 exact 	 ly 	 	what	the	 student 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	was	 the 	 ir 	 	 con 	 cept 	 	about	the	world	.
and	 re 	 ally 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	about	the	 bed 	 room 	 	.
 whet 	 her 	 	the	man	and	woman	decide	to	have	small	family	,	and	take	care	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	,	and	how	long	they	will	live	.	it	's	about	the	 bath 	 room 	 	and	the	kitchen	.	if	you	have	soap	,	water	and	food	,	you	know	,	you	can	live	long	.
and	the	 student 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	right	.	it	was	n't	that	the	world	 consist 	 ed 	 	--	the	world	 consist 	 ed 	 	here	,	of	one	set	of	 count 	 ries 	 	over	here	,	which	had	large	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	and	short	life	.	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	.
and	we	had	one	set	of	 count 	 ries 	 	up	there	which	was	the	western	world	.
they	had	small	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	and	long	life	.
and	you	are	going	to	see	here	the	 amaz 	 ing 	 	thing	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	world	 dur 	 ing 	 	my	 life 	 time 	 	.
then	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	 appli 	 ed 	 	soap	and	water	,	 vaccin 	 ation 	 	.
and	all	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	 start 	 ed 	 	to	 app 	 ly 	 	family	 plan 	 ning 	 	.
and	 part 	 ly 	 	to	usa	who	help	to	provide	technical	 ad 	 vice 	 	and	 invest 	 ment 	 	.
and	you	see	all	the	world	 move 	 s 	 	over	to	a	two	child	family	,	and	a	life	with	60	to	70	 year 	 s 	 	.
but	some	 count 	 ries 	 	remain	back	in	 th 	 is 	 	area	here	.
and	you	can	see	we	still	have	afghanistan	down	here	.
we	have	liberia	.	we	have	congo	.
so	we	have	 count 	 ries 	 	living	there	.
so	the	problem	i	had	is	that	the	 world 	 view 	 	that	my	 student 	 s 	 	had	 correspond 	 s 	 	to	 re 	 ality 	 	in	the	world	the	year	 the 	 ir 	 	 teacher 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	born	.
and	we	,	in	fact	,	when	we	have	 play 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	over	the	world	.	i	was	at	the	global	health	 con 	 ference 	 	here	in	washington	last	week	,	and	i	could	see	the	wrong	 con 	 cept 	 	even	active	people	in	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	had	,
that	they	did	n't	 real 	 ize 	 	the	 improve 	 ment 	 	of	mexico	there	,	and	 chin 	 a 	 	,	in	relation	to	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
look	here	when	i	move	them	forward	.
here	we	go	.
they	catch	up	.	there	's	mexico	.
it	's	on	par	with	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	in	these	two	social	 dimension 	 s 	 	.
there	was	less	than	five	percent	of	the	 special 	 ists 	 	in	global	health	that	was	aware	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	great	nation	,	mexico	,	 ha 	 s 	 	the	problem	that	 arm 	 s 	 	are	coming	from	north	,	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 border 	 s 	 	,	so	they	had	to	stop	that	,
 be 	 cause 	 	they	have	 th 	 is 	 	strange	relationship	to	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	you	know	.
but	if	i	would	change	 th 	 is 	 	axis	here	,	i	would	 in 	 stead 	 	put	income	per	person	.
income	per	person	.	i	can	put	that	here	.
and	we	will	then	see	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	picture	.
by	the	way	,	i	'm	 teach 	 ing 	 	you	how	to	use	our	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	gapminder	world	,	while	i	'm	 correct 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	free	 util 	 ity 	 	on	the	net	.
and	when	i	now	 final 	 ly 	 	got	it	right	,	i	can	go	back	200	 year 	 s 	 	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
and	i	can	find	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	up	there	.
and	i	can	let	the	other	 count 	 ries 	 	be	 show 	 n 	 	.
and	now	i	have	income	per	person	on	 th 	 is 	 	axis	.
and	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	had	some	,	one	,	two	thousand	 dollar 	 s 	 	at	that	time	.
and	the	life	 expect 	 ancy 	 	was	35	to	40	 year 	 s 	 	,	on	par	with	afghanistan	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	what	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	world	,	i	will	show	now	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	for	one	year	at	university	.	you	can	watch	me	for	one	minute	now	and	you	'll	see	the	whole	thing	.
you	can	see	how	the	 brow 	 n 	 	 bubble 	 s 	 	,	which	is	west	europe	,	and	the	yellow	one	,	which	is	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	they	get	 rich 	 er 	 	and	 rich 	 er 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	start	to	get	 health 	 ier 	 	and	 health 	 ier 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	now	100	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	where	the	rest	of	the	world	 remain 	 s 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	.
here	we	come	.	and	that	was	the	influenza	.
that	's	why	we	are	so	 scar 	 ed 	 	about	flu	,	is	n't	it	?
it	's	still	 remember 	 ed 	 	.	the	fall	of	life	 expect 	 ancy 	 	.
and	then	we	come	up	.	not	 un 	 til 	 	 in 	 depend 	 ence 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	.
look	here	you	have	 chin 	 a 	 	over	there	,	you	have	india	over	there	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
did	you	note	there	,	that	we	have	mexico	up	there	?
mexico	is	not	at	all	on	par	with	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,
but	they	are	 quit 	 e 	 	close	.
and	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	see	 chin 	 a 	 	and	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	200	 year 	 s 	 	,
 be 	 cause 	 	i	have	my	 old 	 est 	 	son	now	 work 	 ing 	 	for	google	,	after	google	 acquir 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 soft 	 ware 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	in	fact	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	child	labor	.	my	son	and	his	wife	 s 	 at 	 	in	a	 close 	 t 	 	for	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	and	 develop 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	my	 young 	 est 	 	son	,	who	 stud 	 ied 	 	chinese	in	beijing	.
so	they	come	in	with	the	two	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 s 	 	i	have	,	you	know	?
and	my	son	,	 young 	 est 	 	son	who	 stud 	 ied 	 	in	beijing	,	in	 chin 	 a 	 	,	he	got	a	long	-	term	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	.
 where 	 a 	 s 	 	when	my	 old 	 est 	 	son	,	who	 work 	 s 	 	for	google	,	he	should	develop	by	quarter	,	or	by	half	-	year	.
or	google	is	 quit 	 e 	 	 gen 	 er 	 ous 	 	,	so	he	can	have	one	or	two	 year 	 s 	 	to	go	.
but	in	 chin 	 a 	 	they	look	generation	after	generation	 be 	 cause 	 	they	remember	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 embarrass 	 ing 	 	period	,	for	100	 year 	 s 	 	,	when	they	went	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	.
and	then	they	would	remember	the	first	part	of	last	century	,	which	was	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	,
and	we	could	go	by	 th 	 is 	 	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	great	leap	forward	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	was	1963	.
mao	tse	-	tung	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	health	to	 chin 	 a 	 	,
and	then	he	 di 	 ed 	 	,	and	then	deng	xiaoping	 start 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	move	forward	.
is	n't	it	strange	to	see	that	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	first	grew	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	and	then	 gradu 	 ally 	 	got	rich	?
 where 	 a 	 s 	 	 chin 	 a 	 	could	get	 health 	 y 	 	much	 ear 	 lier 	 	,
 be 	 cause 	 	they	 appli 	 ed 	 	the	knowledge	of	education	,	nutrition	,	and	then	 al 	 so 	 	 benefit 	 s 	 	of	 pen 	 icillin 	 	and	 vaccin 	 es 	 	and	family	 plan 	 ning 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	could	have	social	 develop 	 ment 	 	before	they	got	the	economic	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
so	to	me	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	public	health	professor	,	it	's	not	strange	that	all	these	 count 	 ries 	 	grow	so	fast	now	.
 be 	 cause 	 	what	you	see	here	,	what	you	see	here	is	the	flat	world	of	thomas	friedman	,
is	n't	it	.
it	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	flat	.
but	the	middle	income	 count 	 ries 	 	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	i	suggest	to	my	 student 	 s 	 	,	stop	using	the	 con 	 cept 	 	``	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	.	``	 be 	 cause 	 	after	all	,	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	is	like	 hav 	 ing 	 	two	 chapter 	 s 	 	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
the	last	chapter	is	about	present	,	and	 p 	 resident 	 	obama	,
and	the	other	is	about	the	past	,	where	you	cover	 every 	 thing 	 	from	washington	to	eisenhower	.
 be 	 cause 	 	washington	to	eisenhower	,	that	is	what	we	find	in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	.
we	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	go	to	mayflower	to	eisenhower	,	and	that	would	be	put	together	 in 	 to 	 	a	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	,
which	is	 right 	 ly 	 	growing	 it 	 s 	 	cities	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	way	,
which	have	great	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	have	the	 col 	 lap 	 s 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	.
so	,	how	could	we	make	better	sense	about	 th 	 is 	 	?
well	,	one	way	of	 try 	 ing 	 	is	to	see	 whet 	 her 	 	we	could	look	at	income	 distribut 	 ion 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	income	 distribut 	 ion 	 	of	 people 	 s 	 	in	the	world	,	from	$	1	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	you	have	food	to	eat	.
these	people	go	to	bed	 hung 	 ry 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	number	of	people	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	$	10	,	 whet 	 her 	 	you	have	a	public	or	a	private	health	service	system	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	you	can	provide	health	service	for	your	family	and	school	for	your	children	,
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	oecd	 count 	 ries 	 	:
green	,	latin	america	,	east	europe	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	east	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	,	and	the	light	blue	there	is	south	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	the	world	 change 	 d 	 	.
it	 change 	 d 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
can	you	see	how	it	's	growing	?	and	how	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	and	 billion 	 s 	 	is	coming	out	of	poverty	in	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	?
and	it	 go 	 es 	 	over	here	?
and	i	come	now	,	 in 	 to 	 	 project 	 ions 	 	,
but	i	have	to	stop	at	the	door	of	lehman	 brother 	 s 	 	there	,	you	know	,	 be 	 cause 	 	--	that	's	where	the	 project 	 ions 	 	are	not	valid	any	 long 	 er 	 	.
 prob 	 ably 	 	the	world	will	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	then	it	will	 continu 	 e 	 	forward	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	more	or	less	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	will	happen	,
and	we	have	a	world	which	can	not	be	 look 	 ed 	 	 up 	 on 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 divid 	 ed 	 	.
we	have	the	high	income	 count 	 ries 	 	here	,	with	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 lead 	 ing 	 	power	;
we	have	the	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	in	the	middle	,	which	provide	a	lot	of	the	 fund 	 ing 	 	for	the	 bail 	 out 	 	;
and	we	have	the	low	income	 count 	 ries 	 	here	.
 yea 	 h 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	fact	that	from	where	the	money	 come 	 s 	 	,
they	have	 be 	 en 	 	saving	,	you	know	,	over	the	last	decade	.
and	here	we	have	the	low	income	 count 	 ries 	 	where	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	are	.
and	here	we	have	the	 count 	 ries 	 	in	collapse	and	war	,	like	afghanistan	,	somalia	,	 part 	 s 	 	of	congo	,	darfur	.
we	have	all	 th 	 is 	 	at	the	same	time	.
that	's	why	it	's	so	 problem 	 atic 	 	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	what	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	so	different	,	what	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	there	.
and	that	's	why	i	suggest	a	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	different	approach	of	what	you	would	call	it	.
and	you	have	huge	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	 al 	 so 	 	.
i	heard	that	your	 depart 	 ments 	 	here	 we 	 re 	 	by	 region 	 s 	 	.
here	you	have	sub	-	saharan	africa	,	south	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	,	east	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	,	arab	 state 	 s 	 	,	east	europe	,	latin	america	,	and	oecd	.
and	on	 th 	 is 	 	axis	,	gdp	.
and	on	 th 	 is 	 	,	heath	,	child	 surviv 	 al 	 	,
and	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	come	 a 	 s 	 	a	surprise	that	africa	south	of	sahara	is	at	the	bottom	.
but	when	i	split	it	,	when	i	split	it	 in 	 to 	 	country	 bubble 	 s 	 	,	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	 bubble 	 s 	 	here	is	the	population	.	then	you	see	sierra	leone	and	mauritius	,	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	.
there	is	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	 with 	 in 	 	sub	-	saharan	africa	.
and	i	can	split	the	 other 	 s 	 	.	here	is	the	south	asian	,	arab	world	.
now	all	your	different	 depart 	 ments 	 	.
east	europe	,	latin	america	,	and	oecd	 count 	 ries 	 	.
and	here	 we 	 re 	 	are	.	we	have	a	 continu 	 um 	 	in	the	world	.
we	can	not	put	it	 in 	 to 	 	two	 part 	 s 	 	.
it	is	mayflower	down	here	.	it	is	washington	here	,	building	,	building	 count 	 ries 	 	.
it	's	lincoln	here	,	 advanc 	 ing 	 	them	.
it	's	eisenhower	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	 modern 	 ity 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 count 	 ries 	 	.
and	then	it	's	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	up	here	.
and	we	have	 count 	 ries 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	of	 understand 	 ing 	 	how	the	world	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	.
at	 th 	 is 	 	point	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	make	a	pause	.
and	it	is	my	task	,	on	 be 	 half 	 	of	the	rest	of	the	world	,	to	convey	a	 thank 	 s 	 	to	the	u.s.	 taxpayer 	 s 	 	,	for	 demo 	 graphic 	 	health	survey	.
 man 	 y 	 	are	not	aware	of	--	no	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	joke	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	serious	.
it	is	due	to	usa	's	 continu 	 ous 	 	 sponsor 	 ing 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	25	 year 	 s 	 	of	the	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 method 	 ology 	 	for	 measur 	 ing 	 	child	 mortal 	 ity 	 	that	we	have	a	grasp	of	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	the	world	.
and	it	is	u.s.	government	at	 it 	 s 	 	best	,	 with 	 out 	 	 advoc 	 acy 	 	,	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	 fact 	 s 	 	,	that	it	's	 use 	 ful 	 	for	the	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
and	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	data	free	of	charge	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	for	the	world	to	use	.	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
 quit 	 e 	 	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	of	the	world	bank	,	who	 compil 	 ed 	 	data	with	government	money	,	tax	money	,	and	then	they	sell	it	to	add	a	little	profit	,	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 in 	 efficient 	 	,	gutenberg	way	.
but	the	people	 do 	 ing 	 	that	at	the	world	bank	are	among	the	best	in	the	world	.
and	they	are	 high 	 ly 	 	 skill 	 ed 	 	 professional 	 s 	 	.
it	's	just	that	we	would	like	to	 up 	 grade 	 	our	 inter 	 national 	 	 age 	 ncies 	 	to	deal	with	the	world	in	the	modern	way	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	do	.
and	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	free	data	and	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	,	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	of	america	is	one	of	the	best	.
and	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	come	easy	from	the	mouth	of	a	swedish	public	health	professor	.
and	i	'm	not	paid	to	come	here	,	no	.	i	would	like	to	show	you	what	 happen 	 s 	 	with	the	data	,	what	we	can	show	with	 th 	 is 	 	data	.
look	here	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	world	.
with	income	down	there	and	child	 mortal 	 ity 	 	.
and	what	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	world	?
since	1950	,	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	last	50	 year 	 s 	 	we	have	had	a	fall	in	child	 mortal 	 ity 	 	.
and	it	is	the	dhs	that	 make 	 s 	 	it	possible	to	know	 th 	 is 	 	.

we	have	a	 continu 	 um 	 	.	but	we	still	have	,	of	course	,	congo	,	up	there	.	we	still	have	 a 	 s 	 	poor	 count 	 ries 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	have	had	,	 al 	 ways 	 	,	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
and	that	's	the	bottom	billion	,	where	we	've	heard	 to 	 day 	 	about	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	new	approach	to	do	it	.
and	how	fast	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	?
well	,	mdg	4	.
the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 be 	 en 	 	so	eager	to	use	mdg	4	.
but	you	have	 be 	 en 	 	the	main	sponsor	that	 ha 	 s 	 	enabled	us	to	measure	it	,
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	child	 mortal 	 ity 	 	that	we	can	measure	.
and	we	used	to	say	that	it	should	fall	four	percent	per	year	.
let	's	see	what	sweden	 ha 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	.
we	used	to	boast	about	fast	social	progress	.
that	's	where	we	 we 	 re 	 	,	1900	.
1900	,	sweden	was	there	.
same	child	 mortal 	 ity 	 	 a 	 s 	 	bangladesh	had	,	1990	,
 th 	 ough 	 	they	had	lower	income	.
they	 start 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.	they	used	the	aid	well	.
they	 vaccin 	 ated 	 	the	 kid 	 s 	 	.	they	get	better	water	.
and	they	 reduc 	 ed 	 	child	 mortal 	 ity 	 	,	with	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	4.7	percent	per	year	.	they	beat	sweden	.
i	run	sweden	the	same	16	year	period	.
second	round	,	it	's	sweden	,	1916	,	against	egypt	,	1990	.
here	we	go	.	once	 aga 	 in 	 	the	usa	is	part	of	the	reason	here	.
they	get	safe	water	,	they	get	food	for	the	poor	,
and	they	get	malaria	 eradic 	 ated 	 	.
5.5	percent	.	they	are	 fast 	 er 	 	than	the	 mill 	 e 	 nnium 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	goal	.
and	third	chance	for	sweden	,	against	brazil	here	.
brazil	here	 ha 	 s 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	social	 improve 	 ment 	 	over	the	last	16	 year 	 s 	 	,
and	they	go	 fast 	 er 	 	than	sweden	.
 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	the	world	is	 converg 	 ing 	 	.
the	middle	income	 count 	 ries 	 	,	the	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	they	are	 catch 	 ing 	 	up	.
they	are	moving	to	cities	,	where	they	 al 	 so 	 	get	better	 assist 	 ance 	 	for	that	.
well	the	swedish	 student 	 s 	 	protest	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	.
they	say	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	fair	,	 be 	 cause 	 	these	 count 	 ries 	 	had	 vaccin 	 es 	 	and	 anti 	 biotic 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	not	 avail 	 able 	 	for	sweden	.
we	have	to	do	real	-	time	 com 	 petition 	 	.	``
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	i	give	you	singapore	,	the	year	i	was	born	.
singapore	had	twice	the	child	 mortal 	 ity 	 	of	sweden	.
it	's	the	most	 tropic 	 al 	 	country	in	the	world	,
a	marshland	on	the	 equ 	 ator 	 	.
and	here	we	go	.	it	took	a	little	time	for	them	to	get	 in 	 dependent 	 	.
but	then	they	 start 	 ed 	 	to	grow	 the 	 ir 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
and	they	made	the	social	 invest 	 ment 	 	.	they	got	away	malaria	.
they	got	a	 magnific 	 ent 	 	health	system	that	beat	both	the	u.s.	and	sweden	.
we	never	thought	it	would	happen	that	they	would	win	over	sweden	!
all	these	green	 count 	 ries 	 	are	 achiev 	 ing 	 	 mill 	 e 	 nnium 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	 goal 	 s 	 	.
these	yellow	are	just	about	to	be	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
these	red	are	the	 count 	 ries 	 	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	do	it	,	and	the	policy	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 improv 	 ed 	 	.
not	 simpl 	 istic 	 	extrapolation	.
we	have	to	 re 	 ally 	 	find	a	way	of	 support 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	in	a	better	way	.
we	have	to	respect	the	middle	income	 count 	 ries 	 	on	what	they	are	 do 	 ing 	 	.
and	we	have	to	fact	-	base	the	whole	way	we	look	at	the	world	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	dollar	per	person	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	hiv	in	the	 count 	 ries 	 	.
the	blue	is	africa	.
the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	 bubble 	 s 	 	is	how	 man 	 y 	 	are	hiv	 affect 	 ed 	 	.
you	see	the	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	in	south	africa	there	.
about	20	percent	of	the	adult	population	are	 infect 	 ed 	 	.
and	in	spite	of	them	 hav 	 ing 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	a	high	income	,	they	have	a	huge	number	of	hiv	 infect 	 ed 	 	.
but	you	 al 	 so 	 	see	that	there	are	african	 count 	 ries 	 	down	here	.
there	is	no	 s 	 uch 	 	thing	 a 	 s 	 	an	hiv	 epi 	 demic 	 	in	africa	.
there	's	a	number	,	five	to	10	 count 	 ries 	 	in	africa	that	 ha 	 s 	 	the	same	level	 a 	 s 	 	sweden	and	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
and	there	are	 other 	 s 	 	who	are	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	high	.
and	i	will	show	you	that	what	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	one	of	the	best	 count 	 ries 	 	,	with	the	most	 vib 	 rant 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	in	africa	and	a	good	 govern 	 ance 	 	,	botswana	.
they	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	high	level	.	it	's	coming	down	.
but	now	it	's	not	 fall 	 ing 	 	,
 be 	 cause 	 	there	,	with	help	from	pepfar	,	it	's	 work 	 ing 	 	with	 treat 	 ment 	 	.	and	people	are	not	 dy 	 ing 	 	.
and	you	can	see	it	's	not	that	easy	,	that	it	is	war	which	 caus 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	here	,	in	congo	,	there	is	war	.
and	here	,	in	zambia	,	there	is	peace	.
and	it	's	not	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.	 rich 	 er 	 	country	 ha 	 s 	 	a	little	 high 	 er 	 	.
if	i	split	tanzania	in	 it 	 s 	 	income	,
the	 rich 	 er 	 	20	percent	in	tanzania	 ha 	 s 	 	more	hiv	than	the	 poor 	 est 	 	one	.
and	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	different	 with 	 in 	 	each	country	.
look	at	the	 pro 	 vince 	 s 	 	of	kenya	.	they	are	 ver 	 y 	 	different	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	you	see	.
it	's	not	deep	poverty	.	it	's	the	special	 situ 	 ation 	 	,
 prob 	 ably 	 	of	concurrent	sexual	 partner 	 ship 	 	among	part	of	the	 hetero 	 sexual 	 	population	in	some	 count 	 ries 	 	,	or	some	 part 	 s 	 	of	 count 	 ries 	 	,	in	south	and	eastern	africa	.
do	n't	make	it	africa	.	do	n't	make	it	a	race	issue	.
make	it	a	local	issue	.	and	do	 prevent 	 ion 	 	at	each	place	,	in	the	way	it	can	be	 d 	 one 	 	there	.
there	are	 thing 	 s 	 	of	 suffer 	 ing 	 	in	the	one	billion	 poor 	 est 	 	,	which	we	do	n't	know	.
 t 	 hose 	 	who	live	beyond	the	 cell 	 phone 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	who	have	yet	to	see	a	computer	,	 t 	 hose 	 	who	have	no	 electric 	 ity 	 	at	home	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	disease	,	konzo	,	i	 s 	 pent 	 	20	 year 	 s 	 	elucidating	in	africa	.
it	's	 caus 	 ed 	 	by	fast	 process 	 ing 	 	of	toxic	 cass 	 a 	 va 	 	root	in	famine	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
it	's	similar	to	the	pellagra	 epi 	 demic 	 	in	mississippi	in	the	'30s	.
it	's	similar	to	other	 nutrition 	 al 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	.
it	will	never	affect	a	rich	person	.
we	have	 s 	 een 	 	it	here	in	mozambique	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 epi 	 demic 	 	in	mozambique	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 epi 	 demic 	 	in	 north 	 ern 	 	tanzania	.
you	never	heard	about	the	disease	.
but	it	's	much	more	than	 eb 	 ola 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 affect 	 ed 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	disease	.

there	is	still	 myster 	 y 	 	in	one	billion	.
and	we	have	to	have	more	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	than	just	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	and	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	.
we	need	a	new	 mind 	 set 	 	.	the	world	is	 converg 	 ing 	 	,

they	are	still	 a 	 s 	 	poor	 a 	 s 	 	they	've	ever	 be 	 en 	 	.
it	's	not	 sustain 	 able 	 	,	and	it	will	not	happen	around	one	 super 	 power 	 	.
