so	,	120	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	dr.	r√∂ntgen	x	-	rayed	his	wife	's	hand	.
 quit 	 e 	 	why	he	had	to	pin	her	 finger 	 s 	 	to	the	floor	with	her	brooch	,	i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	.	it	 seem 	 s 	 	a	bit	 extrem 	 e 	 	to	me	.
that	image	was	the	start	of	the	x	-	ray	technology	.
and	i	'm	still	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	using	the	same	 principle 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
i	'm	 interpret 	 ing 	 	it	in	a	more	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	manner	.
the	first	shot	i	ever	did	was	of	a	soda	can	,	which	was	to	promote	a	brand	that	we	all	know	,	so	i	'm	not	going	to	do	them	any	 favor 	 s 	 	by	 show 	 ing 	 	you	it	.
but	the	second	shot	i	did	was	my	 shoe 	 s 	 	i	was	 wear 	 ing 	 	on	the	day	.
and	i	do	 re 	 ally 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	shot	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 show 	 s 	 	all	the	 detri 	 tu 	 s 	 	that	's	sort	of	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	in	the	sole	of	the	 sneak 	 ers 	 	.
it	was	just	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	pot	-	luck	 thing 	 s 	 	where	you	get	it	right	first	time	.
moving	on	to	 some 	 thing 	 	a	bit	 large 	 r 	 	,
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	x	-	ray	of	a	bus	.
and	the	bus	is	full	of	people	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	same	person	.	it	's	just	one	skeleton	.
and	back	in	the	'60s	,	they	used	to	teach	student	 radi 	 ographer 	 s 	 	to	take	x	-	 ray 	 s 	 	,	 thank 	 fully 	 	not	on	you	and	i	,	but	on	dead	people	.
so	,	i	've	still	got	access	to	one	of	these	dead	people	 call 	 ed 	 	frieda	;	she	's	 fall 	 ing 	 	 a 	 part 	 	,	i	'm	 af 	 raid 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	she	's	 ver 	 y 	 	old	and	fragile	.
but	 every 	 one 	 	on	that	bus	is	frieda	.
and	the	bus	is	taken	with	a	 car 	 go 	 	-	 s 	 canning 	 	x	-	ray	,	which	is	the	sort	of	machine	you	have	on	 border 	 s 	 	,	which	 check 	 s 	 	for	 contr 	 a 	 band 	 	and	 drug 	 s 	 	and	 bomb 	 s 	 	and	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 fair 	 ly 	 	obvious	what	that	is	.
so	,	using	large	-	scale	 object 	 s 	 	 do 	 es 	 	sort	of	create	drama	 be 	 cause 	 	you	just	do	n't	see	x	-	 ray 	 s 	 	of	big	 thing 	 s 	 	that	often	.
technology	is	moving	 a 	 head 	 	,
and	these	large	 car 	 go 	 	scanner	x	-	 ray 	 s 	 	that	work	with	the	digital	system	are	 get 	 ting 	 	better	and	better	and	better	.
 aga 	 in 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	,	to	make	it	come	 al 	 ive 	 	you	need	,	 some 	 how 	 	,	to	add	the	human	element	.
and	i	think	the	reason	 th 	 is 	 	image	 work 	 s 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	is	 be 	 cause 	 	frieda	is	 driv 	 ing 	 	the	 bulldoze 	 r 	 	.
 quit 	 e 	 	a	difficult	brief	,	make	a	pair	of	men	's	pants	look	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
but	i	think	the	process	,	in	 it 	 self 	 	,	 show 	 s 	 	how	exquisite	they	are	.
fashion	--	now	,	i	'm	sort	of	anti	-	fashion	 be 	 cause 	 	i	do	n't	show	the	surface	,	i	show	what	's	 with 	 in 	 	.
so	,	the	 fashion 	 ista 	 s 	 	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	like	me	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	if	kate	moss	is	 wear 	 ing 	 	it	or	if	i	'm	 wear 	 ing 	 	it	,	it	 look 	 s 	 	the	same	.
we	all	look	the	same	 in 	 side 	 	,	 believ 	 e 	 	me	.
the	 crease 	 s 	 	in	the	material	and	the	sort	of	 nuance 	 s 	 	.
and	i	show	 thing 	 s 	 	for	 re 	 ally 	 	what	they	are	,	what	they	're	made	of	.
i	peel	back	the	 layer 	 s 	 	and	 ex 	 pose 	 	it	.
and	if	it	's	well	made	i	show	it	,	if	it	's	 bad 	 ly 	 	made	i	show	it	.
and	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	ross	can	associate	that	with	design	.
the	design	 come 	 s 	 	from	 with 	 in 	 	.
it	's	not	just	topshop	,
i	get	some	strange	 look 	 s 	 	when	i	go	out	 get 	 ting 	 	my	 prop 	 s 	 	.
here	i	was	 fum 	 bling 	 	around	in	the	 lad 	 ies 	 	'	 under 	 wear 	 	 depart 	 ment 	 	of	a	 depart 	 ment 	 	store	,	 al 	 most 	 	got	 es 	 cort 	 ed 	 	from	the	 pre 	 mis 	 es 	 	.
i	live	 oppos 	 ite 	 	a	farm	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	 run 	 t 	 	of	the	litter	,	a	piglet	that	 di 	 ed 	 	.
and	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	,	if	you	look	at	the	 leg 	 s 	 	,	you	'll	notice	that	the	 bone 	 s 	 	have	n't	fused	.
and	should	that	pig	have	grown	,	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	it	was	dead	,	it	would	have	 certain 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	dead	after	i	x	-	rayed	it	,	with	the	amount	of	 radi 	 ation 	 	i	used	 any 	 way 	 	.
but	once	the	 bone 	 s 	 	had	fused	together	it	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	 health 	 y 	 	.
so	,	that	's	an	empty	 park 	 a 	 	jacket	.
but	i	 quit 	 e 	 	love	the	way	it	's	posed	.
nature	is	my	 great 	 est 	 	inspiration	.
and	to	carry	on	with	a	theme	that	we	've	 al 	 ready 	 	 touch 	 ed 	 	with	is	how	nature	is	related	to	 architect 	 ure 	 	.
if	you	look	at	the	roof	of	the	eden	project	,	or	the	british	library	,	it	's	all	 th 	 is 	 	 honey 	 comb 	 	structure	.
and	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 architect 	 s 	 	are	inspired	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	am	,	by	what	 surround 	 s 	 	us	,	by	nature	.
 th 	 is 	 	,	in	fact	,	is	a	victoria	water	 li 	 ly 	 	leaf	that	 float 	 s 	 	on	the	top	of	a	pond	.
an	amaryllis	flower	looking	 re 	 ally 	 	three	-	dimensional	.
 sea 	 weed 	 	,	 ebb 	 ing 	 	in	the	tide	.
now	,	how	do	i	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	where	do	i	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	all	of	that	sort	of	thing	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	my	new	,	purpose	-	built	,	x	-	ray	shed	.
and	the	door	to	my	x	-	ray	room	is	made	of	lead	and	steel	.
it	 weigh 	 s 	 	1,250	 kilo 	 gram 	 s 	 	and	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 exercis 	 e 	 	i	get	is	 open 	 ing 	 	and	 clo 	 s 	 ing 	 	it	.
the	 wall 	 s 	 	are	700	 millimeter 	 s 	 	thick	of	solid	dense	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	.
so	,	i	'm	using	 quit 	 e 	 	a	lot	of	 radi 	 ation 	 	.
a	lot	more	than	you	'd	get	in	a	hospital	or	a	vet	's	.
and	there	i	am	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 quit 	 e 	 	high	-	powered	x	-	ray	machine	.
what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	about	x	-	ray	 re 	 ally 	 	is	,	if	you	think	about	it	,	is	that	that	technology	is	used	for	looking	for	cancer	or	looking	for	 drug 	 s 	 	,	or	looking	for	 contr 	 a 	 band 	 	or	 what 	 ever 	 	.
and	i	use	that	sort	of	technology	to	create	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 quit 	 e 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
so	,	still	 work 	 ing 	 	with	film	,	i	'm	 af 	 raid 	 	.
technology	in	x	-	ray	where	it	's	life	-	 s 	 ize 	 	 process 	 ed 	 	,	 a 	 part 	 	from	these	large	 car 	 go 	 	-	 s 	 canning 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 move 	 d 	 	on	 en 	 ough 	 	for	the	quality	of	the	image	and	the	 re 	 solution 	 	to	be	good	 en 	 ough 	 	for	what	i	want	to	do	with	it	,	which	is	show	my	 picture 	 s 	 	big	.
so	,	i	have	to	use	a	1980s	drum	scanner	,	which	was	designed	in	the	 day 	 s 	 	when	 every 	 one 	 	shot	 photograph 	 s 	 	on	film	.
they	 s 	 can 	 	each	individual	x	-	ray	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 show 	 s 	 	how	i	do	my	process	of	same	-	 s 	 ize 	 	x	-	 ray 	 s 	 	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	my	daughter	's	dress	.
still	 ha 	 s 	 	the	tag	in	it	from	me	 buy 	 ing 	 	it	,	so	i	can	take	it	back	to	the	shop	if	she	did	n't	like	it	.
but	there	are	four	x	-	ray	 plate 	 s 	 	.
you	can	see	them	 over 	 lap 	 ping 	 	.
so	,	when	you	move	forward	from	 some 	 thing 	 	 fair 	 ly 	 	small	,	a	dress	which	is	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 ize 	 	,	onto	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	which	is	 d 	 one 	 	in	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	process	,	you	can	see	that	that	is	a	lot	of	work	.
in	fact	,	that	is	three	 month 	 s 	 	solid	x	-	raying	.
there	is	over	500	 separat 	 e 	 	 component 	 s 	 	.
boeing	 s 	 ent 	 	me	a	747	in	 contain 	 ers 	 	.
and	i	 s 	 ent 	 	them	back	an	x	-	ray	.
i	kid	you	not	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	frieda	is	my	dead	skeleton	.
 th 	 is 	 	,	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	two	 picture 	 s 	 	.
one	on	the	 extrem 	 e 	 	right	is	a	photograph	of	an	american	 foot 	 ball 	 er 	 	.
the	one	on	the	left	is	an	x	-	ray	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	time	i	had	to	use	a	real	body	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	 need 	 ed 	 	all	the	skin	tissue	to	make	it	look	real	,	to	make	it	look	like	it	was	a	real	athlete	.
so	,	here	i	had	to	use	a	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 de 	 cease 	 d 	 	body	.
and	 get 	 ting 	 	a	hold	of	that	was	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	difficult	and	 labor 	 ious 	 	.
but	people	do	 don 	 ate 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	bodies	to	art	and	science	.
and	when	they	do	,	i	'm	in	the	queue	.
so	,	i	like	to	use	them	.
the	 color 	 ing 	 	,	so	 color 	 ing 	 	 add 	 s 	 	 an 	 other 	 	level	to	the	x	-	 ray 	 s 	 	.
it	 make 	 s 	 	it	more	 organ 	 ic 	 	,	more	natural	.
it	's	 what 	 ever 	 	 take 	 s 	 	my	 f 	 ancy 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	.
it	's	not	 accurate 	 ly 	 	 color 	 ed 	 	to	how	it	is	in	real	life	.
that	flower	 do 	 es 	 	n't	come	in	bright	 o 	 range 	 	,	i	do	n't	think	.
but	i	just	like	it	in	bright	 o 	 range 	 	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	with	 some 	 thing 	 	technical	,	like	these	are	dj	 deck 	 s 	 	,	it	sort	of	 add 	 s 	 	 an 	 other 	 	level	.
it	 make 	 s 	 	a	two	dimensional	image	look	more	three	dimensional	.
the	most	difficult	 thing 	 s 	 	to	x	-	ray	,	the	most	 technical 	 ly 	 	 challeng 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	to	x	-	ray	are	the	 light 	 est 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	the	most	 delic 	 ate 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
to	get	the	detail	in	a	feather	,	 believ 	 e 	 	me	,	if	there	is	 any 	 one 	 	out	here	who	 know 	 s 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	about	x	-	 ray 	 s 	 	,	that	's	 quit 	 e 	 	a	 challeng 	 e 	 	.
i	'm	now	going	to	show	you	a	short	film	,	i	'll	step	to	the	side	.
video	:	the	thing	in	there	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
if	you	touch	that	,	you	could	possibly	die	through	 radi 	 ation 	 	 poison 	 ing 	 	.
in	my	 care 	 er 	 	i	've	had	two	 expo 	 s 	 ures 	 	to	 radi 	 ation 	 	,	which	is	two	too	 man 	 y 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 stay 	 s 	 	with	you	for	life	.	it	's	cumulative	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	human	 con 	 not 	 ations 	 	.
the	fact	that	it	's	a	child	's	 to 	 y 	 	that	we	all	 recogn 	 ize 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	it	's	a	robot	,	and	it	 come 	 s 	 	from	a	sci	-	fi	 gen 	 us 	 	.
it	's	a	surprise	that	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 human 	 ity 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	man	-	made	,	future	,	alien	 associ 	 ations 	 	.
and	it	's	just	a	bit	 s 	 pooky 	 	.
the	bus	was	 d 	 one 	 	with	a	 car 	 go 	 	-	 s 	 canning 	 	x	-	ray	machine	,	which	is	used	on	the	 border 	 s 	 	between	 count 	 ries 	 	,	looking	for	 contr 	 a 	 band 	 	and	 il 	 legal 	 	 im 	 migrant 	 s 	 	.
the	 lor 	 ry 	 	 go 	 es 	 	in	front	of	it	.	and	it	 take 	 s 	 	 slice 	 s 	 	of	x	-	 ray 	 s 	 	through	the	 lor 	 ry 	 	.
and	that	's	how	 th 	 is 	 	was	 d 	 one 	 	.	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	slice	,	slice	.
it	's	a	bit	like	a	ct	scanner	in	a	hospital	.	 slice 	 s 	 	.
and	then	if	you	look	 care 	 fully 	 	,	there	is	all	little	 thing 	 s 	 	.
he	's	got	 head 	 phone 	 s 	 	on	,	 read 	 ing 	 	the	 news 	 paper 	 	,	got	a	hat	on	,	 glass 	 es 	 	,	got	a	bag	.
so	,	these	little	 detail 	 s 	 	help	to	make	it	work	,	make	it	real	.
the	problem	with	using	living	people	is	that	to	take	an	x	-	ray	,	if	i	x	-	ray	you	,	you	get	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	to	 radi 	 ation 	 	.
so	,	to	avoid	that	--	i	have	to	avoid	it	 some 	 how 	 	--	is	i	use	dead	people	.
now	,	that	's	a	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	,	from	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 de 	 cease 	 d 	 	bodies	,	to	a	skeleton	that	was	used	by	student	 radi 	 ographer 	 s 	 	to	train	in	taking	x	-	 ray 	 s 	 	of	the	human	body	,	at	different	 den 	 s 	 ities 	 	.
i	have	 ver 	 y 	 	high	-	tech	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	of	 glove 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 cis 	 s 	 ors 	 	and	a	 buck 	 et 	 	.
i	will	show	how	the	 cap 	 ill 	 ary 	 	action	 work 	 s 	 	,	how	it	 feed 	 s 	 	,	i	'll	be	able	to	get	all	the	 cell 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	that	stem	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	 transfer 	 s 	 	food	from	 it 	 s 	 	 root 	 s 	 	to	 it 	 s 	 	 leav 	 es 	 	.
look	at	 th 	 is 	 	 mon 	 ster 	 	.
it	's	so	 bas 	 ic 	 	.	it	just	 grow 	 s 	 	wild	.
that	's	what	i	 re 	 ally 	 	like	about	it	,	the	fact	that	i	have	n't	got	to	go	and	buy	it	,	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 be 	 en 	 	 genetic 	 ally 	 	 modifi 	 ed 	 	at	all	.
it	's	just	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
and	the	x	-	ray	 show 	 s 	 	how	 beaut 	 iful 	 	nature	can	be	.
not	that	that	is	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	when	you	look	at	it	with	the	human	eye	,	the	way	the	 leav 	 es 	 	form	.	they	're	 curl 	 ing 	 	back	on	each	other	.
so	the	x	-	ray	will	show	the	 over 	 lap 	 s 	 	in	these	little	 corner 	 s 	 	.
the	 thick 	 er 	 	the	object	,	the	more	 radi 	 ation 	 	it	 need 	 s 	 	,	and	the	more	time	it	 need 	 s 	 	.
the	 light 	 er 	 	the	object	,	the	less	 radi 	 ation 	 	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	you	keep	the	time	up	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	time	 give 	 s 	 	you	detail	.
the	 long 	 er 	 	the	 expo 	 s 	 ure 	 	 go 	 es 	 	on	for	,	the	more	detail	you	get	.
if	you	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	,	just	the	tube	,	it	is	 quit 	 e 	 	bright	.
but	i	could	get	a	bit	 dark 	 er 	 	in	the	tube	,	but	 every 	 thing 	 	else	would	suffer	.
so	,	these	 leav 	 es 	 	at	the	edge	would	start	to	disappear	.
what	i	like	is	how	hard	the	 edge 	 s 	 	are	,	how	sharp	.
 yea 	 h 	 	,	i	'm	 quit 	 e 	 	 pleas 	 ed 	 	with	it	.
i	travel	beyond	the	surface	and	show	 some 	 thing 	 	for	what	it	's	worth	,	for	what	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	made	of	,	how	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 work 	 s 	 	.
but	 al 	 so 	 	i	find	that	i	've	got	the	benefit	of	taking	away	all	the	surface	,	which	is	 thing 	 s 	 	that	people	are	used	to	 see 	 ing 	 	.
and	that	's	the	sort	of	thing	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	.
i	've	got	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	now	to	show	you	what	i	'm	going	to	be	 do 	 ing 	 	in	the	future	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	commercial	application	of	my	most	 re 	 cent 	 	work	.
and	what	's	good	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	think	,	is	that	it	's	like	a	moment	in	time	,	like	you	've	 turn 	 ed 	 	around	,	you	've	got	x	-	ray	vision	and	you	've	taken	a	picture	with	the	x	-	ray	camera	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	i	have	n't	got	x	-	ray	vision	.
i	do	dream	in	x	-	ray	.	i	see	my	 project 	 s 	 	in	my	sleep	.
and	i	know	what	they	're	going	to	look	like	in	x	-	ray	and	i	'm	not	far	off	.
so	,	what	am	i	 do 	 ing 	 	in	the	future	?
well	,	 th 	 is 	 	year	is	the	50th	 annivers 	 ary 	 	of	issigonis	's	mini	,	which	is	one	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 car 	 s 	 	.
so	,	i	've	taken	it	 a 	 part 	 	,	component	by	component	,	 month 	 s 	 	and	 month 	 s 	 	and	 month 	 s 	 	of	work	.
and	with	 th 	 is 	 	image	,	i	'm	going	to	be	 dis 	 play 	 ing 	 	it	in	the	victoria	and	albert	museum	 a 	 s 	 	a	light	box	,	which	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 attach 	 ed 	 	to	the	car	.
so	,	i	've	got	to	saw	the	car	in	half	,	down	the	middle	,	not	an	easy	task	,	in	 it 	 self 	 	.
and	then	,	so	you	can	get	in	the	driver	's	side	,	 s 	 it 	 	down	,	and	up	against	you	is	a	wall	.
and	if	you	get	out	and	walk	around	to	the	other	side	of	the	car	,	you	see	a	life	-	sized	light	box	of	the	car	 show 	 ing 	 	you	how	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'm	going	to	take	that	idea	and	 app 	 ly 	 	it	to	other	sort	of	 icon 	 ic 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	from	my	life	.
like	,	my	first	computer	was	a	big	 move 	 ment 	 	in	my	life	.
and	i	had	a	mac	classic	.	and	it	's	a	little	box	.
and	i	think	that	would	look	 quit 	 e 	 	neat	 a 	 s 	 	an	x	-	ray	.
