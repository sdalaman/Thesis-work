what	i	'd	like	to	do	is	just	drag	us	all	down	 in 	 to 	 	the	 gutt 	 er 	 	,	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	all	the	way	down	 in 	 to 	 	the	 sew 	 er 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	want	to	talk	about	 dia 	 rrhea 	 	.
and	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	i	want	to	talk	about	the	design	of	 dia 	 rrhea 	 	.
and	when	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 biologist 	 s 	 	talk	about	design	,	they	 re 	 ally 	 	mean	design	by	natural	 s 	 election 	 	.
and	that	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	me	to	the	title	of	the	talk	,	``	using	evolution	to	design	disease	 organism 	 s 	 	 intelligent 	 ly 	 	.	``
and	i	 al 	 so 	 	have	a	little	bit	of	a	sort	of	 smart 	 ass 	 	 sub 	 title 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	i	'm	not	just	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	to	be	cute	.
i	 re 	 ally 	 	think	that	 th 	 is 	 	 sub 	 title 	 	 explain 	 s 	 	what	 some 	 body 	 	like	me	,	who	's	sort	of	a	darwin	 wan 	 na 	 be 	 	,	how	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	look	at	one	's	role	in	sort	of	coming	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	field	of	health	 science 	 s 	 	and	medicine	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	not	a	 ver 	 y 	 	friendly	field	for	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 biologist 	 s 	 	.
you	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	a	great	potential	,	but	you	see	a	lot	of	people	who	are	sort	of	 defend 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	turf	,	and	may	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	 ver 	 y 	 	resistant	,	when	one	tries	to	 introduc 	 e 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	.
so	,	all	of	the	talk	 to 	 day 	 	is	going	to	deal	with	two	general	 question 	 s 	 	.
one	is	that	,	why	are	some	disease	 organism 	 s 	 	more	 harm 	 ful 	 	?	and	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 close 	 ly 	 	related	question	,	which	is	,	how	can	we	take	control	of	 th 	 is 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	once	we	understand	the	answer	to	the	first	question	?
how	can	we	make	the	 harm 	 ful 	 	 organism 	 s 	 	more	mild	?
and	i	'm	going	to	be	 talk 	 ing 	 	,	to	begin	with	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	about	 dia 	 rrhea 	 l 	 	disease	 organism 	 s 	 	.
and	the	focus	when	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	 dia 	 rrhea 	 l 	 	 organism 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	the	focus	when	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	any	 organism 	 s 	 	that	cause	 a 	 cute 	 	 infect 	 ious 	 	disease	,	is	to	think	about	the	problem	from	a	germ	's	point	of	view	,
germ	's	-	eye	view	.
and	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	to	think	about	a	fundamental	idea	which	i	think	 make 	 s 	 	sense	out	of	a	tremendous	amount	of	 vari 	 ation 	 	in	the	 harm 	 fulness 	 	of	disease	 organism 	 s 	 	.
and	that	idea	is	that	from	the	germ	's	-	eye	point	of	view	,	disease	 organism 	 s 	 	have	to	get	from	one	host	to	 an 	 other 	 	,	and	often	they	have	to	 re 	 ly 	 	on	the	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	of	the	host	to	move	them	to	 an 	 other 	 	host	.
but	not	 al 	 ways 	 	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	you	get	disease	 organism 	 s 	 	that	do	n't	 re 	 ly 	 	on	host	 mobil 	 ity 	 	at	all	for	 trans 	 mission 	 	.
and	when	you	have	that	,	then	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	us	that	natural	 s 	 election 	 	will	favor	the	more	 exploit 	 ative 	 	,	more	predator	-	like	 organism 	 s 	 	.
so	,	natural	 s 	 election 	 	will	favor	 organism 	 s 	 	that	are	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	cause	damage	.
if	 in 	 stead 	 	 trans 	 mission 	 	to	 an 	 other 	 	host	 requir 	 es 	 	host	 mobil 	 ity 	 	,	then	we	expect	that	the	 winner 	 s 	 	of	the	 com 	 petition 	 	will	be	the	 mild 	 er 	 	 organism 	 s 	 	.
so	,	if	the	pathogen	 do 	 es 	 	n't	need	the	host	to	be	 health 	 y 	 	and	active	,	and	actual	 s 	 election 	 	 favor 	 s 	 	 pathogen 	 s 	 	that	take	advantage	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 host 	 s 	 	,	the	 winner 	 s 	 	in	the	 com 	 petition 	 	are	 t 	 hose 	 	that	exploit	the	 host 	 s 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 re 	 productive 	 	success	.
but	if	the	host	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	mobile	in	order	to	transmit	the	pathogen	,	then	it	's	the	benign	 one 	 s 	 	that	tend	to	be	the	 winner 	 s 	 	.
so	,	i	'm	going	to	begin	by	 app 	 ly 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	idea	to	 dia 	 rrhea 	 l 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	.
 dia 	 rrhea 	 l 	 	disease	 organism 	 s 	 	get	 transmit 	 ted 	 	in	 bas 	 ically 	 	three	ways	.
they	can	be	 transmit 	 ted 	 	from	person	-	to	-	person	contact	,	person	-	to	-	food	-	then	-	to	-	person	contact	,	when	 some 	 body 	 	eats	 contami 	 nated 	 	food	,
or	they	can	be	 transmit 	 ted 	 	through	the	water	.
and	when	they	're	 transmit 	 ted 	 	through	the	water	,	 un 	 like 	 	the	first	two	 mode 	 s 	 	of	 trans 	 mission 	 	,	these	 pathogen 	 s 	 	do	n't	 re 	 ly 	 	on	a	 health 	 y 	 	host	for	 trans 	 mission 	 	.
a	person	can	be	sick	in	bed	and	still	infect	 ten 	 s 	 	,	even	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	other	 individual 	 s 	 	.
to	sort	of	 illustr 	 ate 	 	that	,	 th 	 is 	 	 dia 	 gram 	 	 emphas 	 ize 	 s 	 	that	if	you	've	got	a	sick	person	in	bed	,	 some 	 body 	 	's	going	to	be	taking	out	the	 contami 	 nated 	 	 material 	 s 	 	.
they	're	going	to	wash	 t 	 hose 	 	 contami 	 nated 	 	 material 	 s 	 	,	and	then	the	water	may	move	 in 	 to 	 	 source 	 s 	 	of	 drink 	 ing 	 	water	.
people	will	come	in	to	 t 	 hose 	 	 place 	 s 	 	where	you	've	got	 contami 	 nated 	 	 drink 	 ing 	 	water	,	 br 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	back	to	the	family	,	may	drink	right	at	that	point	.
the	whole	point	is	that	a	person	who	ca	n't	move	can	still	infect	 man 	 y 	 	other	 individual 	 s 	 	.
and	so	,	the	 theor 	 y 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	us	that	when	 dia 	 rrhea 	 l 	 	disease	 organism 	 s 	 	are	 transport 	 ed 	 	by	water	,	we	expect	them	to	be	more	predator	-	like	,	more	 harm 	 ful 	 	.
and	you	can	test	these	 idea 	 s 	 	.
so	,	one	way	you	can	test	is	just	look	at	all	 dia 	 rrhea 	 l 	 	bacteria	,	and	see	 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	tend	to	be	more	 transmit 	 ted 	 	by	water	,	tend	to	be	more	 harm 	 ful 	 	.
and	the	answer	is	--	 y 	 ep 	 	,	they	are	.
now	i	put	 t 	 hose 	 	 name 	 s 	 	in	there	just	for	the	bacteria	 buff 	 s 	 	,	but	the	main	point	here	is	that	--	there	's	a	lot	of	them	here	,	i	can	tell	--	the	main	point	here	is	that	 t 	 hose 	 	data	 point 	 s 	 	all	show	a	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	,	positive	 associ 	 ation 	 	between	the	degree	to	which	a	disease	organism	is	 transmit 	 ted 	 	by	water	,	and	how	 harm 	 ful 	 	they	are	,	how	much	death	they	cause	per	 un 	 treat 	 ed 	 	 infect 	 ion 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 suggest 	 s 	 	we	're	on	the	right	track	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	,	to	me	,	 suggest 	 s 	 	that	we	 re 	 ally 	 	need	to	ask	some	 add 	 ition 	 al 	 	 question 	 s 	 	.
remember	the	second	question	that	i	raised	at	the	 out 	 set 	 	was	,	how	can	we	use	 th 	 is 	 	knowledge	to	make	disease	 organism 	 s 	 	evolve	to	be	mild	?
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	 suggest 	 s 	 	that	if	you	could	just	block	 water 	 borne 	 	 trans 	 mission 	 	,	you	could	cause	disease	 organism 	 s 	 	to	shift	from	the	right	-	hand	side	of	that	graph	to	the	left	-	hand	side	of	the	graph	.
but	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	tell	you	how	long	.
i	mean	,	if	 th 	 is 	 	would	 requir 	 e 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	then	it	's	 worth 	 less 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 controll 	 ing 	 	of	these	 pathogen 	 s 	 	.
but	if	it	could	occur	in	just	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	then	it	might	be	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	way	to	control	some	of	the	nasty	 problem 	 s 	 	that	we	have	n't	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	control	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 suggest 	 s 	 	that	we	could	 domestic 	 ate 	 	these	 organism 	 s 	 	.
we	could	make	them	evolve	to	be	not	so	 harm 	 ful 	 	to	us	.
and	so	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	focused	on	 th 	 is 	 	organism	,	which	is	the	el	tor	 bio 	 type 	 	of	the	organism	 call 	 ed 	 	vibrio	 cholera 	 e 	 	.
and	that	is	the	species	of	organism	that	is	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	 caus 	 ing 	 	cholera	.
and	the	reason	i	thought	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 re 	 ally 	 	great	organism	to	look	at	is	that	we	understand	why	it	's	so	 harm 	 ful 	 	.
it	's	 harm 	 ful 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 produce 	 s 	 	a	toxin	,
and	that	toxin	is	released	when	the	organism	 get 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	our	intestinal	tract	.
it	 cause 	 s 	 	fluid	to	flow	from	the	 cell 	 s 	 	that	line	our	intestine	 in 	 to 	 	the	 lum 	 en 	 	,	the	internal	chamber	of	our	intestine	,	and	then	that	fluid	 go 	 es 	 	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	it	can	,	which	is	out	the	other	end	.
and	it	 flush 	 es 	 	out	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	different	other	 competitor 	 s 	 	that	would	 other 	 wise 	 	make	life	difficult	for	the	 vibrio 	 s 	 	.
so	what	 happen 	 s 	 	,	if	you	've	got	an	organism	,	it	 produce 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	toxin	.	after	a	few	 day 	 s 	 	of	 infect 	 ion 	 	you	end	up	 hav 	 ing 	 	--	the	 fec 	 al 	 	material	 re 	 ally 	 	is	n't	so	 disgust 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	might	imagine	.
it	's	sort	of	 cloud 	 y 	 	water	.
and	if	you	took	a	drop	of	that	water	,	you	might	find	a	million	 dia 	 rrhea 	 l 	 	 organism 	 s 	 	.
if	the	organism	 produce 	 d 	 	a	lot	of	toxin	,	you	might	find	10	million	,	or	100	million	.
if	it	did	n't	produce	a	lot	of	 th 	 is 	 	toxin	,	then	you	might	find	a	 small 	 er 	 	number	.
so	the	task	is	to	try	to	figure	out	how	to	determine	 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	you	could	get	an	organism	like	 th 	 is 	 	to	evolve	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 mild 	 ness 	 	by	 block 	 ing 	 	 water 	 borne 	 	 trans 	 mission 	 	,	 there 	 by 	 	 allow 	 ing 	 	the	organism	 on 	 ly 	 	to	be	 transmit 	 ted 	 	by	person	-	to	-	person	contact	,	or	person	-	food	-	person	contact	--
both	of	which	would	 re 	 ally 	 	 requir 	 e 	 	that	people	be	mobile	and	 fair 	 ly 	 	 health 	 y 	 	for	 trans 	 mission 	 	.
now	,	i	can	think	of	some	possible	 experiment 	 s 	 	.
one	would	be	to	take	a	lot	of	different	 s 	 train 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	organism	--	some	that	produce	a	lot	of	 toxin 	 s 	 	,	some	that	produce	a	little	--	and	take	 t 	 hose 	 	 s 	 train 	 s 	 	and	spew	them	out	in	different	 count 	 ries 	 	.
some	 count 	 ries 	 	that	might	have	clean	water	 suppli 	 es 	 	,	so	that	you	ca	n't	get	 water 	 borne 	 	 trans 	 mission 	 	:	you	expect	the	organism	to	evolve	to	 mild 	 ness 	 	there	.
other	 count 	 ries 	 	,	in	which	you	've	got	a	lot	of	 water 	 borne 	 	 trans 	 mission 	 	,	there	you	expect	these	 organism 	 s 	 	to	evolve	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	a	high	level	of	 harm 	 fulness 	 	,	right	?
there	's	a	little	 ethic 	 al 	 	problem	in	 th 	 is 	 	experiment	.
i	was	 hop 	 ing 	 	to	hear	a	few	 gasp 	 s 	 	at	 l 	 east 	 	.
that	 make 	 s 	 	me	worry	a	little	bit	.
but	 any 	 how 	 	,	the	laughter	 make 	 s 	 	me	feel	a	little	bit	better	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 ethic 	 al 	 	problem	's	a	big	problem	.
just	to	 emphas 	 ize 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	.
here	's	a	girl	who	's	 al 	 most 	 	dead	.
she	got	 re 	 hyd 	 ration 	 	therapy	,	she	 perk 	 ed 	 	up	,	 with 	 in 	 	a	few	 day 	 s 	 	she	was	looking	like	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	person	.
so	,	we	do	n't	want	to	run	an	experiment	like	that	.
but	 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	just	that	thing	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	1991	.
in	1991	,	 th 	 is 	 	cholera	organism	got	 in 	 to 	 	 lim 	 a 	 	,	peru	,	and	 with 	 in 	 	two	 month 	 s 	 	it	had	spread	to	the	 neighbor 	 ing 	 	 area 	 s 	 	.
now	,	i	do	n't	know	how	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	and	i	did	n't	have	 any 	 thing 	 	to	do	with	it	,	i	promise	you	.
i	do	n't	think	 any 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	,	but	i	'm	not	 a 	 verse 	 	to	,	once	that	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	to	see	 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	the	 predict 	 ion 	 	that	we	would	make	,	that	i	did	make	before	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	 hold 	 s 	 	up	.
did	the	organism	evolve	to	 mild 	 ness 	 	in	a	place	like	chile	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	some	of	the	most	well	 protect 	 ed 	 	water	 suppli 	 es 	 	in	latin	america	?
and	did	it	evolve	to	be	more	 harm 	 ful 	 	in	a	place	like	ecuador	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	some	of	the	 l 	 east 	 	well	 protect 	 ed 	 	?
and	peru	's	got	 some 	 thing 	 	sort	of	in	between	.
and	so	,	with	 fund 	 ing 	 	from	the	bosack	-	kruger	 found 	 ation 	 	,	i	got	a	lot	of	 s 	 train 	 s 	 	from	these	different	 count 	 ries 	 	and	we	 measur 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	toxin	production	in	the	lab	.
and	we	found	that	in	chile	--	 with 	 in 	 	two	 month 	 s 	 	of	the	invasion	of	peru	you	had	 s 	 train 	 s 	 	 enter 	 ing 	 	chile	--
and	when	you	look	at	 t 	 hose 	 	 s 	 train 	 s 	 	,	in	the	 ver 	 y 	 	far	left	-	hand	side	of	 th 	 is 	 	graph	,	you	see	a	lot	of	 vari 	 ation 	 	in	the	toxin	production	.
each	dot	 correspond 	 s 	 	to	an	 is 	 let 	 	from	a	different	person	--
a	lot	of	 vari 	 ation 	 	on	which	natural	 s 	 election 	 	can	act	.
but	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	point	is	,	if	you	look	over	the	1990s	,	 with 	 in 	 	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	the	 organism 	 s 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	to	be	more	mild	.
they	 evolv 	 ed 	 	to	produce	less	toxin	.	and	to	just	give	you	a	sense	of	how	 import 	 ant 	 	 th 	 is 	 	might	be	,	if	we	look	in	1995	,	we	find	that	there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	one	case	of	cholera	,	on	average	,	 report 	 ed 	 	from	chile	every	two	 year 	 s 	 	.
so	,	it	's	controlled	.
that	's	how	much	we	have	in	america	,	cholera	that	's	 acquir 	 ed 	 	 en 	 demic 	 ally 	 	,
and	we	do	n't	think	we	've	got	a	problem	here	.
they	did	n't	--	they	 solve 	 d 	 	the	problem	in	chile	.
but	,	before	we	get	too	confident	,	we	'd	better	look	at	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	other	 count 	 ries 	 	,	and	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	organism	 do 	 es 	 	n't	just	 al 	 ways 	 	evolve	 to 	 ward 	 	 mild 	 ness 	 	.
well	,	in	peru	it	did	n't	.
and	in	ecuador	--	remember	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	place	where	it	 ha 	 s 	 	the	highest	potential	 water 	 borne 	 	 trans 	 mission 	 	--	it	 look 	 ed 	 	like	it	got	more	 harm 	 ful 	 	.
in	every	case	there	's	a	lot	of	 vari 	 ation 	 	,	but	 some 	 thing 	 	about	the	environment	the	people	are	living	in	,	and	i	think	the	 on 	 ly 	 	realistic	 explan 	 ation 	 	is	that	it	's	the	degree	of	 water 	 borne 	 	 trans 	 mission 	 	,	 favor 	 ed 	 	the	 harm 	 ful 	 	 s 	 train 	 s 	 	in	one	place	,	and	mild	 s 	 train 	 s 	 	in	 an 	 other 	 	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 encourag 	 ing 	 	,	it	 suggest 	 s 	 	that	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	might	want	to	do	 any 	 how 	 	,	if	we	had	 en 	 ough 	 	money	,	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	give	us	a	much	 big 	 ger 	 	bang	for	the	buck	.
it	would	make	these	 organism 	 s 	 	evolve	to	 mild 	 ness 	 	,	so	that	even	 th 	 ough 	 	people	might	be	 get 	 ting 	 	 infect 	 ed 	 	,	they	'd	be	 infect 	 ed 	 	with	mild	 s 	 train 	 s 	 	.
it	would	n't	be	 caus 	 ing 	 	severe	disease	.
but	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 a 	 spect 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	if	you	could	control	the	evolution	of	 virul 	 ence 	 	,	evolution	of	 harm 	 fulness 	 	,	then	you	should	be	able	to	control	 anti 	 biotic 	 	 resist 	 ance 	 	.
and	the	idea	is	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	.
if	you	've	got	a	 harm 	 ful 	 	organism	,	a	high	proportion	of	the	people	are	going	to	be	 symptom 	 atic 	 	,	a	high	proportion	of	the	people	are	going	to	be	going	to	get	 anti 	 biotic 	 s 	 	.
you	've	got	a	lot	of	pressure	 favor 	 ing 	 	 anti 	 biotic 	 	 resist 	 ance 	 	,	so	you	get	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	 virul 	 ence 	 	 lead 	 ing 	 	to	the	evolution	of	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	 anti 	 biotic 	 	 resist 	 ance 	 	.
and	once	you	get	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	 anti 	 biotic 	 	 resist 	 ance 	 	,	the	 anti 	 biotic 	 s 	 	are	n't	 knock 	 ing 	 	out	the	 harm 	 ful 	 	 s 	 train 	 s 	 	 any 	 more 	 	.
so	,	you	've	got	a	 high 	 er 	 	level	of	 virul 	 ence 	 	.
so	,	you	get	 th 	 is 	 	 vic 	 ious 	 	cycle	.
the	goal	is	to	turn	 th 	 is 	 	around	.
if	you	could	cause	an	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 de 	 crease 	 	in	 virul 	 ence 	 	by	 clean 	 ing 	 	up	the	water	supply	,	you	should	be	able	to	get	an	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 de 	 crease 	 	in	 anti 	 biotic 	 	 resist 	 ance 	 	.
so	,	we	can	go	to	the	same	 count 	 ries 	 	and	look	and	see	.
did	chile	avoid	the	problem	of	 anti 	 biotic 	 	 resist 	 ance 	 	,
 where 	 a 	 s 	 	did	ecuador	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	the	 begin 	 ning 	 s 	 	of	the	problem	?
if	we	look	in	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	1990s	,	we	see	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	a	lot	of	 vari 	 ation 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	on	the	y	-	axis	,	we	've	just	got	a	measure	of	 anti 	 biotic 	 	 sensitiv 	 ity 	 	--
and	i	wo	n't	go	 in 	 to 	 	that	.
but	we	've	got	a	lot	of	 vari 	 ation 	 	in	 anti 	 biotic 	 	 sensitiv 	 ity 	 	in	chile	,	peru	and	ecuador	,	and	no	trend	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 year 	 s 	 	.
but	if	we	look	at	the	end	of	the	1990s	,	just	half	a	decade	 lat 	 er 	 	,	we	see	that	in	ecuador	they	 start 	 ed 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	 resist 	 ance 	 	problem	.
 anti 	 biotic 	 	 sensitiv 	 ity 	 	was	going	down	.
and	in	chile	,	you	still	had	 anti 	 biotic 	 	 sensitiv 	 ity 	 	.
so	,	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	chile	 dodge 	 d 	 	two	 bullet 	 s 	 	.
they	got	the	organism	to	evolve	to	 mild 	 ness 	 	,	and	they	got	no	 develop 	 ment 	 	of	 anti 	 biotic 	 	 resist 	 ance 	 	.
now	,	these	 idea 	 s 	 	should	 app 	 ly 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	board	,
 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	figure	out	why	some	 organism 	 s 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	to	 virul 	 ence 	 	.
and	i	want	to	give	you	just	one	more	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	've	 talk 	 ed 	 	a	little	bit	about	malaria	.
and	the	 ex 	 ample 	 	i	want	to	deal	with	is	,	or	the	idea	i	want	to	deal	with	,	the	question	is	,	what	can	we	do	to	try	to	get	the	 malaria 	 l 	 	organism	to	evolve	to	 mild 	 ness 	 	?
now	,	malaria	's	 transmit 	 ted 	 	by	a	mosquito	,	and	 normal 	 ly 	 	if	you	're	 infect 	 ed 	 	with	malaria	,	and	you	're	 feel 	 ing 	 	sick	,	it	 make 	 s 	 	it	even	 eas 	 ier 	 	for	the	mosquito	to	bite	you	.
and	you	can	show	,	just	by	looking	at	data	from	 liter 	 ature 	 	,	that	vector	-	borne	 disease 	 s 	 	are	more	 harm 	 ful 	 	than	non	-	vector	-	borne	 disease 	 s 	 	.
but	i	think	there	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 fasci 	 nating 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	what	one	can	do	 experiment 	 ally 	 	to	try	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	 demonst 	 rate 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
in	the	case	of	 water 	 borne 	 	 trans 	 mission 	 	,	we	'd	like	to	clean	up	the	water	 suppli 	 es 	 	,	see	 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	we	can	get	 t 	 hose 	 	 organism 	 s 	 	to	evolve	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 mild 	 ness 	 	.
in	the	case	of	malaria	,	what	we	'd	like	to	do	is	mosquito	-	proof	 house 	 s 	 	.
and	the	logic	's	a	little	more	subtle	here	.
if	you	mosquito	-	proof	 house 	 s 	 	,	when	people	get	sick	,	they	're	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	bed	--	or	in	mosquito	-	proof	 hospital 	 s 	 	,	they	're	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	a	hospital	bed	--	and	the	 mosquito 	 es 	 	ca	n't	get	to	them	.
so	,	if	you	're	a	 harm 	 ful 	 	 vari 	 ant 	 	in	a	place	where	you	've	got	mosquito	-	proof	housing	,	then	you	're	a	 lose 	 r 	 	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	 pathogen 	 s 	 	that	get	 transmit 	 ted 	 	are	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	are	 infect 	 ing 	 	people	that	feel	 health 	 y 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	to	walk	 out 	 side 	 	and	get	mosquito	 bite 	 s 	 	.
so	,	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	to	mosquito	proof	 house 	 s 	 	,	you	should	be	able	to	get	these	 organism 	 s 	 	to	evolve	to	 mild 	 ness 	 	.
and	there	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	experiment	that	was	 d 	 one 	 	that	 suggest 	 s 	 	that	we	 re 	 ally 	 	should	go	 a 	 head 	 	and	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	that	experiment	was	 d 	 one 	 	in	 north 	 ern 	 	alabama	.
just	to	give	you	a	little	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	've	 give 	 n 	 	you	a	star	at	the	intellectual	center	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	which	is	right	there	in	louisville	,	kentucky	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	experiment	was	 d 	 one 	 	about	200	 mile 	 s 	 	south	of	there	,	in	 north 	 ern 	 	alabama	,	by	the	tennessee	 val 	 ley 	 	 author 	 ity 	 	.
they	had	 dam 	 med 	 	up	the	tennessee	river	.
they	'd	 caus 	 ed 	 	the	water	to	back	up	,	they	 need 	 ed 	 	electric	,	 hydro 	 electric 	 	power	.
and	when	you	get	 stag 	 nant 	 	water	,	you	get	 mosquito 	 es 	 	.
they	found	in	the	late	'30s	--	10	 year 	 s 	 	after	they	'd	made	these	 dam 	 s 	 	--	that	the	people	in	 north 	 ern 	 	alabama	 we 	 re 	 	 infect 	 ed 	 	with	malaria	,
about	a	third	to	half	of	them	 we 	 re 	 	 infect 	 ed 	 	with	malaria	.
 th 	 is 	 	 show 	 s 	 	you	the	 position 	 s 	 	of	some	of	these	 dam 	 s 	 	.
ok	,	so	the	tennessee	 val 	 ley 	 	 author 	 ity 	 	was	in	a	little	bit	of	a	bind	.
there	was	n't	ddt	,	there	was	n't	 chloro 	 qui 	 nes 	 	:	what	do	they	do	?
well	,	they	 decide 	 d 	 	to	mosquito	proof	every	house	in	 north 	 ern 	 	alabama	.
so	they	did	.	they	 divid 	 ed 	 	 north 	 ern 	 	alabama	 in 	 to 	 	11	 zone 	 s 	 	,	and	 with 	 in 	 	three	 year 	 s 	 	,	about	100	 dollar 	 s 	 	per	house	,	they	mosquito	 proof 	 ed 	 	every	house	.
and	these	are	the	data	.
every	row	 a 	 cross 	 	here	 represent 	 s 	 	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	11	 zone 	 s 	 	.
and	the	 aste 	 risk 	 s 	 	represent	the	time	at	which	the	mosquito	 proof 	 ing 	 	was	complete	.
and	so	what	you	can	see	is	that	just	the	mosquito	-	 proof 	 ed 	 	housing	,	and	 noth 	 ing 	 	else	,	 caus 	 ed 	 	the	 eradic 	 ation 	 	of	malaria	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	,	 incident 	 ally 	 	,	 publish 	 ed 	 	in	1949	,	in	the	 lead 	 ing 	 	 text 	 book 	 	of	malaria	,	 call 	 ed 	 	``	boyd	's	malariology	.	``
but	 al 	 most 	 	no	malaria	 expert 	 s 	 	even	know	it	 exist 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 import 	 ant 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 tell 	 s 	 	us	that	if	you	have	moderate	 bit 	 ing 	 	 den 	 s 	 ities 	 	,	you	can	 eradic 	 ate 	 	malaria	by	mosquito	 proof 	 ing 	 	 house 	 s 	 	.
now	,	i	would	suggest	that	you	could	do	 th 	 is 	 	in	a	lot	of	 place 	 s 	 	.
like	,	you	know	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	you	get	 in 	 to 	 	the	malaria	zone	,	sub	-	saharan	africa	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	you	move	to	 re 	 ally 	 	 intens 	 e 	 	 bit 	 ing 	 	rate	 area 	 s 	 	,	like	nigeria	,	you	're	 certain 	 ly 	 	not	going	to	 eradic 	 ate 	 	.
but	that	's	when	you	should	be	 favor 	 ing 	 	evolution	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 mild 	 ness 	 	.
so	to	me	,	it	's	an	experiment	that	's	 wait 	 ing 	 	to	happen	,	and	if	it	 confirm 	 s 	 	the	 predict 	 ion 	 	,	then	we	should	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	tool	.
in	a	way	,	much	more	 power 	 ful 	 	than	the	kind	of	 tool 	 s 	 	we	're	looking	at	,
 be 	 cause 	 	most	of	what	's	 be 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	 to 	 day 	 	is	to	 re 	 ly 	 	on	 thing 	 s 	 	like	anti	-	 malaria 	 l 	 	 drug 	 s 	 	.
and	we	know	that	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	it	's	great	to	make	 t 	 hose 	 	anti	-	 malaria 	 l 	 	 drug 	 s 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	at	 re 	 ally 	 	low	cost	and	high	frequency	,	we	know	that	when	you	make	them	 high 	 ly 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	you	're	going	to	get	 resist 	 ance 	 	to	 t 	 hose 	 	 drug 	 s 	 	.
and	so	it	's	a	short	-	term	solution	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	long	-	term	solution	.
what	i	'm	 suggest 	 ing 	 	here	is	that	we	could	get	evolution	 work 	 ing 	 	in	the	direction	we	want	it	to	go	,
 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 al 	 ways 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	battle	evolution	 a 	 s 	 	a	problem	that	 s 	 ty 	 mies 	 	our	 effort 	 s 	 	to	control	the	pathogen	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	with	anti	-	 malaria 	 l 	 	 drug 	 s 	 	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	table	i	've	 give 	 n 	 	just	to	 emphas 	 ize 	 	that	i	've	 on 	 ly 	 	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	two	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	logic	 appli 	 es 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	board	for	 infect 	 ious 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	,	and	it	ought	to	.
 be 	 cause 	 	when	we	're	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	 infect 	 ious 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	,	we	're	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	living	 system 	 s 	 	.
we	're	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	living	 system 	 s 	 	;	we	're	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	 system 	 s 	 	that	evolve	.
and	so	if	you	do	 some 	 thing 	 	with	 t 	 hose 	 	 system 	 s 	 	,	they	're	going	to	evolve	one	way	or	 an 	 other 	 	.
and	all	i	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	is	that	we	need	to	figure	out	how	they	'll	evolve	,	so	that	--	we	need	to	adjust	our	 intervention 	 s 	 	to	get	the	most	bang	for	the	intervention	buck	,	so	that	we	can	get	these	 organism 	 s 	 	to	evolve	in	the	direction	we	want	them	to	go	.
so	,	i	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	have	time	to	talk	about	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	but	i	did	want	to	put	them	up	there	,	just	to	give	you	a	sense	that	there	 re 	 ally 	 	are	 solution 	 s 	 	to	 controll 	 ing 	 	the	evolution	of	 harm 	 fulness 	 	of	some	of	the	nasty	 pathogen 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 confront 	 ed 	 	with	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 link 	 s 	 	up	with	a	lot	of	the	other	 idea 	 s 	 	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	.
so	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 ear 	 lier 	 	 to 	 day 	 	there	was	 discuss 	 ion 	 	of	,	how	do	you	 re 	 ally 	 	lower	sexual	 trans 	 mission 	 	of	hiv	?
what	 th 	 is 	 	 emphas 	 ize 	 s 	 	is	that	we	need	to	figure	out	how	it	will	work	.
will	it	 may 	 be 	 	get	 lower 	 ed 	 	if	we	alter	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	of	the	area	?
it	may	get	 lower 	 ed 	 	if	we	 inter 	 vene 	 	in	ways	that	 encourag 	 e 	 	people	to	stay	more	 faith 	 ful 	 	to	 partner 	 s 	 	,	and	so	on	.
but	the	key	thing	is	to	figure	out	how	to	lower	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	we	lower	it	,	we	'll	get	an	 evolution 	 ary 	 	change	in	the	virus	.
and	the	data	 re 	 ally 	 	do	support	 th 	 is 	 	:	that	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	get	the	virus	 evolv 	 ing 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 mild 	 ness 	 	.
and	that	will	just	add	to	the	 effective 	 ness 	 	of	our	control	 effort 	 s 	 	.
so	the	other	thing	i	 re 	 ally 	 	like	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	 be 	 side 	 s 	 	the	fact	that	it	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	a	whole	new	dimension	 in 	 to 	 	the	 stud 	 y 	 	of	control	of	disease	,	is	that	often	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 intervention 	 s 	 	that	you	want	,	that	it	 indic 	 ates 	 	should	be	 d 	 one 	 	,	are	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 intervention 	 s 	 	that	people	want	 any 	 how 	 	.
but	people	just	have	n't	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	 just 	 ify 	 	the	cost	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	kind	of	thing	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	.
if	we	know	that	we	're	going	to	get	extra	bang	for	the	buck	from	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	clean	water	,	then	i	think	that	we	can	say	,	let	's	push	the	effort	 in 	 to 	 	that	 a 	 spect 	 	of	the	control	,	so	that	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	solve	the	problem	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	,	if	you	just	look	at	the	frequency	of	 infect 	 ion 	 	,	you	would	suggest	that	you	ca	n't	solve	the	problem	well	 en 	 ough 	 	just	by	 clean 	 ing 	 	up	water	supply	.
