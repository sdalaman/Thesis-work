i	love	a	 challeng 	 e 	 	,	and	saving	the	earth	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	a	good	one	.
we	all	know	the	earth	is	in	trouble	.
we	have	now	 enter 	 ed 	 	in	the	6x	,	the	sixth	major	 extinct 	 ion 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	.
i	often	 wonder 	 ed 	 	,	if	there	was	a	 unit 	 ed 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	of	 organism 	 s 	 	--	 other 	 wise 	 	known	 a 	 s 	 	``	uh	-	oh	``	--	--	and	every	organism	had	a	right	to	vote	,	would	we	be	 vot 	 ed 	 	on	the	planet	,	or	off	the	planet	?
i	think	that	vote	is	 occur 	 ring 	 	right	now	.
i	want	to	present	to	you	a	 suit 	 e 	 	of	six	 myco 	 logical 	 	 solution 	 s 	 	,	using	fungi	,	and	these	 solution 	 s 	 	are	based	on	 mycel 	 ium 	 	.
the	 mycel 	 ium 	 	 in 	 fuse 	 s 	 	all	 land 	 scapes 	 	,	it	 hold 	 s 	 	 s 	 oil 	 s 	 	together	,	it	's	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 ten 	 acious 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 hold 	 s 	 	up	to	30,000	 time 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	mass	.
they	're	the	grand	 mole 	 cular 	 	 dis 	 assemble 	 rs 	 	of	nature	--	the	 s 	 oil 	 	 magic 	 ians 	 	.
they	generate	the	 hum 	 us 	 	 s 	 oil 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 land 	 masse 	 s 	 	of	earth	.
we	have	now	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	there	is	a	multi	-	 direction 	 al 	 	transfer	of	 nutrient 	 s 	 	between	 plant 	 s 	 	,	 mitig 	 ated 	 	by	the	 mcyel 	 ium 	 	--	so	the	 mycel 	 ium 	 	is	the	mother	that	is	giving	 nutrient 	 s 	 	from	 al 	 der 	 	and	 bi 	 rch 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	to	 hem 	 lock 	 s 	 	,	 cedar 	 s 	 	and	douglas	 fir 	 s 	 	.
 dust 	 y 	 	and	i	,	we	like	to	say	,	on	sunday	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	we	go	to	church	.
i	'm	in	love	with	the	old	-	growth	forest	,	and	i	'm	a	 patriot 	 ic 	 	american	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	 t 	 hose 	 	.
most	of	you	are	familiar	with	portobello	 mushroom 	 s 	 	.
and	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	i	face	a	big	obstacle	.	when	i	 ment 	 ion 	 	 mushroom 	 s 	 	to	 some 	 body 	 	,	they	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	think	portobellos	or	magic	 mushroom 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	 glaz 	 e 	 	over	,	and	they	think	i	'm	a	little	crazy	.
so	,	i	hope	to	 pierc 	 e 	 	that	prejudice	 fore 	 ver 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	group	.
we	call	it	 myco 	 phobia 	 	,	the	irrational	fear	of	the	 un 	 known 	 	,	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	fungi	.
 mushroom 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	fast	in	 the 	 ir 	 	growth	.
day	21	,	day	23	,	day	25	.
 mushroom 	 s 	 	produce	strong	 anti 	 biotic 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	we	're	more	 close 	 ly 	 	related	to	fungi	than	we	are	to	any	other	 king 	 dom 	 	.
a	group	of	20	 eukary 	 otic 	 	 micro 	 biologist 	 s 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	a	paper	two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	 erect 	 ing 	 	opisthokonta	--	a	super	-	 king 	 dom 	 	that	 join 	 s 	 	 animal 	 ia 	 	and	fungi	together	.
we	share	in	common	the	same	 pathogen 	 s 	 	.
fungi	do	n't	like	to	rot	from	bacteria	,	and	so	our	best	 anti 	 biotic 	 s 	 	come	from	fungi	.
but	here	is	a	mushroom	that	's	past	 it 	 s 	 	prime	.
after	they	 sporulat 	 e 	 	,	they	do	rot	.
but	i	 pro 	 pose 	 	to	you	that	the	sequence	of	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	that	occur	on	 rot 	 ting 	 	 mushroom 	 s 	 	are	essential	for	the	health	of	the	forest	.
they	give	rise	to	the	 tree 	 s 	 	,	they	create	the	 deb 	 ris 	 	 field 	 s 	 	that	feed	the	 mycel 	 ium 	 	.
and	so	we	see	a	mushroom	here	 sporulat 	 ing 	 	.
and	the	 s 	 pore 	 s 	 	are	 germ 	 in 	 ating 	 	,	and	the	 mycel 	 ium 	 	 form 	 s 	 	and	 go 	 es 	 	 under 	 ground 	 	.
in	a	single	cubic	inch	of	 s 	 oil 	 	,	there	can	be	more	than	eight	 mile 	 s 	 	of	these	 cell 	 s 	 	.
my	foot	is	 cover 	 ing 	 	 approximate 	 ly 	 	300	 mile 	 s 	 	of	 mycel 	 ium 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 photo 	 micro 	 graph 	 s 	 	from	nick	read	and	patrick	hickey	.
and	notice	that	 a 	 s 	 	the	 mycel 	 ium 	 	 grow 	 s 	 	,	it	 conquer 	 s 	 	 territ 	 ory 	 	and	then	it	 begin 	 s 	 	the	net	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	a	 s 	 canning 	 	electron	 micro 	 scopist 	 	for	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	have	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	electron	 micro 	 graph 	 s 	 	,	and	when	i	'm	 star 	 ing 	 	at	the	 mycel 	 ium 	 	,	i	 real 	 ize 	 	that	they	are	 micro 	 filtration 	 	 membrane 	 s 	 	.
we	 exhal 	 e 	 	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	,	so	 do 	 es 	 	 mycel 	 ium 	 	.
it	 inhal 	 es 	 	oxygen	,	just	like	we	do	.
but	these	are	 essential 	 ly 	 	 external 	 ized 	 	 stomach 	 s 	 	and	 lung 	 s 	 	.
and	i	present	to	you	a	 con 	 cept 	 	that	these	are	 extend 	 ed 	 	 neuro 	 logical 	 	 membrane 	 s 	 	.
and	in	these	 cav 	 ities 	 	,	these	micro	-	 cav 	 ities 	 	form	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	they	fuse	 s 	 oil 	 s 	 	,	they	absorb	water	.
these	are	little	 well 	 s 	 	.
and	 in 	 side 	 	these	 well 	 s 	 	,	then	 micro 	 bi 	 al 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	begin	to	form	.
and	so	the	spongy	 s 	 oil 	 	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 resist 	 s 	 	 ero 	 s 	 ion 	 	,	but	 set 	 s 	 	up	a	 micro 	 bi 	 al 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	that	 give 	 s 	 	rise	to	a	 plural 	 ity 	 	of	other	 organism 	 s 	 	.
i	first	 pro 	 posed 	 	,	in	the	early	1990s	,	that	 mycel 	 ium 	 	is	earth	's	natural	 inter 	 net 	 	.
when	you	look	at	the	 mycel 	 ium 	 	,	they	're	 high 	 ly 	 	 branch 	 ed 	 	.
and	if	there	's	one	branch	that	is	broken	,	then	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 nod 	 es 	 	of	 cross 	 ing 	 	--	 inter 	 net 	 	 engineer 	 s 	 	 may 	 be 	 	call	them	hot	 point 	 s 	 	--	there	are	 alter 	 native 	 	 path 	 ways 	 	for	 channel 	 ing 	 	 nutrient 	 s 	 	and	information	.
the	 mycel 	 ium 	 	is	 senti 	 ent 	 	.
it	 know 	 s 	 	that	you	are	there	.
when	you	walk	 a 	 cross 	 	 land 	 scapes 	 	,	it	 leap 	 s 	 	up	in	the	 after 	 math 	 	of	your	 foot 	 step 	 s 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	grab	 deb 	 ris 	 	.
so	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	the	 invent 	 ion 	 	of	the	computer	 inter 	 net 	 	is	an	 inevit 	 able 	 	 con 	 sequence 	 	of	a	 previous 	 ly 	 	proven	,	 bio 	 logically 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	model	.
the	earth	 invent 	 ed 	 	the	computer	 inter 	 net 	 	for	 it 	 s 	 	own	benefit	,	and	we	now	,	 be 	 ing 	 	the	top	organism	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	,	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 al 	 locate 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	in	order	to	protect	the	 bio 	 sphere 	 	.
going	way	out	,	dark	matter	 conform 	 s 	 	to	the	same	 mycel 	 ial 	 	 arche 	 type 	 	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	matter	 be 	 get 	 s 	 	life	;	life	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	single	 cell 	 s 	 	;	single	 cell 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 string 	 s 	 	;	 string 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 chain 	 s 	 	;	 chain 	 s 	 	network	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	paradigm	that	we	see	 through 	 out 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
most	of	you	may	not	know	that	fungi	 we 	 re 	 	the	first	 organism 	 s 	 	to	come	to	land	.
they	came	to	land	1.3	billion	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	 plant 	 s 	 	 follow 	 ed 	 	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	hundred	million	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
how	is	that	possible	?
it	's	possible	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 mycel 	 ium 	 	 produce 	 s 	 	 oxal 	 ic 	 	 acid 	 s 	 	,	and	 man 	 y 	 	other	 acid 	 s 	 	and	 enzyme 	 s 	 	,	 pock 	 mark 	 ing 	 	rock	and	 grab 	 bing 	 	 calc 	 ium 	 	and	other	 mineral 	 s 	 	and	 form 	 ing 	 	 calc 	 ium 	 	 oxal 	 ates 	 	.
 make 	 s 	 	the	 rock 	 s 	 	 crumb 	 le 	 	,	and	the	first	step	in	the	generation	of	 s 	 oil 	 	.
 oxal 	 ic 	 	acid	is	two	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	 molecule 	 s 	 	 join 	 ed 	 	together	.
so	,	fungi	and	 mycel 	 ium 	 	 sequest 	 er 	 	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	in	the	form	of	 calc 	 ium 	 	 oxal 	 ates 	 	.
and	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	other	 oxal 	 ates 	 	are	 al 	 so 	 	 sequest 	 er 	 ing 	 	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	through	the	 mineral 	 s 	 	that	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 form 	 ed 	 	and	taken	out	of	the	rock	 m 	 atrix 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	first	 discover 	 ed 	 	in	1859	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	photograph	by	franz	hueber	.
 th 	 is 	 	photograph	's	taken	1950s	in	saudi	arabia	.
420	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 th 	 is 	 	organism	 exist 	 ed 	 	.
it	was	 call 	 ed 	 	prototaxites	.
prototaxites	,	 lay 	 ing 	 	down	,	was	about	three	feet	tall	.
the	 tall 	 est 	 	 plant 	 s 	 	on	earth	at	that	time	 we 	 re 	 	less	than	two	feet	.
dr.	boyce	,	at	the	university	of	chicago	,	 publish 	 ed 	 	an	article	in	the	journal	of	 geo 	 logy 	 	 th 	 is 	 	past	year	 determi 	 ning 	 	that	prototaxites	was	a	giant	fungus	,	a	giant	mushroom	.
 a 	 cross 	 	the	 land 	 scapes 	 	of	earth	 we 	 re 	 	 dot 	 ted 	 	these	giant	 mushroom 	 s 	 	.
all	 a 	 cross 	 	most	land	 masse 	 s 	 	.
and	these	 exist 	 ed 	 	for	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
now	,	we	've	had	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 extinct 	 ion 	 	 event 	 s 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	we	march	forward	--	65	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	--	most	of	you	know	about	it	--	we	had	an	 a 	 steroid 	 	impact	.
the	earth	was	 s 	 truck 	 	by	an	 a 	 steroid 	 	,	a	huge	amount	of	 deb 	 ris 	 	was	 jettison 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	atmosphere	.
 s 	 un 	 light 	 	was	cut	off	,	and	fungi	 inherit 	 ed 	 	the	earth	.
 t 	 hose 	 	 organism 	 s 	 	that	 pair 	 ed 	 	with	fungi	 we 	 re 	 	 reward 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	fungi	do	not	need	light	.
more	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	at	einstein	university	,	they	just	 determine 	 d 	 	that	fungi	use	 radi 	 ation 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	source	of	energy	,	much	like	 plant 	 s 	 	use	light	.
so	,	the	prospect	of	fungi	 exist 	 ing 	 	on	other	 planet 	 s 	 	 else 	 where 	 	,	i	think	,	is	a	 for 	 gone 	 	 con 	 clusion 	 	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	in	my	own	mind	.
the	largest	organism	in	the	world	is	in	eastern	oregon	.
i	could	n't	 mis 	 s 	 	it	.	it	was	2,200	 acre 	 s 	 	in	 s 	 ize 	 	:
2,200	 acre 	 s 	 	in	 s 	 ize 	 	,	2,000	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
the	largest	organism	on	the	planet	is	a	 mycel 	 ial 	 	mat	,	one	cell	wall	thick	.
how	is	it	that	 th 	 is 	 	organism	can	be	so	large	,	and	yet	be	one	cell	wall	thick	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	we	have	five	or	six	skin	 layer 	 s 	 	that	protect	us	?
the	 mycel 	 ium 	 	,	in	the	right	 condition 	 s 	 	,	 produce 	 s 	 	a	mushroom	--	it	 burst 	 s 	 	through	with	 s 	 uch 	 	 fer 	 o 	 city 	 	that	it	can	break	asphalt	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	with	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 experiment 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	show	you	six	,	if	i	can	,	 solution 	 s 	 	for	 help 	 ing 	 	to	 s 	 ave 	 	the	world	.
battelle	 labor 	 ator 	 ies 	 	and	i	 join 	 ed 	 	up	in	bellingham	,	washington	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	four	 pile 	 s 	 	 saturate 	 d 	 	with	 dies 	 el 	 	and	other	petroleum	waste	:
one	was	a	control	pile	;	one	pile	was	 treat 	 ed 	 	with	 enzyme 	 s 	 	;	one	pile	was	 treat 	 ed 	 	with	bacteria	;	and	our	pile	we	 inocul 	 ated 	 	with	mushroom	 mycel 	 ium 	 	.
the	 mycel 	 ium 	 	 absorb 	 s 	 	the	oil	.
the	 mycel 	 ium 	 	is	producing	 enzyme 	 s 	 	--	 per 	 oxid 	 ase 	 s 	 	--	that	break	carbon	-	hydrogen	 bond 	 s 	 	.
these	are	the	same	 bond 	 s 	 	that	hold	 hydro 	 carbon 	 s 	 	together	.
so	,	the	 mycel 	 ium 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 saturate 	 d 	 	with	the	oil	,	and	then	,	when	we	 return 	 ed 	 	six	 week 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	all	the	 tarp 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	,	all	the	other	 pile 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	dead	,	dark	and	 stink 	 y 	 	.
we	came	back	to	our	pile	,	it	was	 cover 	 ed 	 	with	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 pound 	 s 	 	of	oyster	 mushroom 	 s 	 	,	and	the	color	 change 	 d 	 	to	a	light	form	.
the	 enzyme 	 s 	 	 re 	 manufactur 	 ed 	 	the	 hydro 	 carbon 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 carbohydrate 	 s 	 	--	 f 	 ung 	 al 	 	 sugar 	 s 	 	.
some	of	these	 mushroom 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	 mushroom 	 s 	 	.
they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	large	.
they	're	 show 	 ing 	 	how	much	nutrition	that	they	could	've	 obtain 	 ed 	 	.
but	 some 	 thing 	 	else	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	which	was	an	 epiph 	 any 	 	in	my	life	.
they	 sporulat 	 ed 	 	,	the	 s 	 pore 	 s 	 	attract	 insect 	 s 	 	,	the	 insect 	 s 	 	laid	 egg 	 s 	 	,	 egg 	 s 	 	 be 	 came 	 	 larva 	 e 	 	.
 bird 	 s 	 	then	came	,	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	in	 seed 	 s 	 	,	and	our	pile	 be 	 came 	 	an	 oa 	 sis 	 	of	life	.
 where 	 a 	 s 	 	the	other	three	 pile 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	dead	,	dark	and	 stink 	 y 	 	,	and	the	pah	's	--	the	 aroma 	 tic 	 	 hydro 	 carbon 	 s 	 	--	went	from	10,000	 part 	 s 	 	per	million	to	less	than	200	in	eight	 week 	 s 	 	.
the	last	image	we	do	n't	have	.	the	entire	pile	was	a	green	berm	of	life	.
these	are	 gate 	 way 	 	species	,
 van 	 guard 	 	species	that	open	the	door	for	other	 bio 	 logical 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	.
so	i	 invent 	 ed 	 	 bur 	 lap 	 	 s 	 ack 	 s 	 	,	 bunk 	 er 	 	spawn	--	and	 put 	 ting 	 	the	 mycel 	 ium 	 	--	using	storm	blown	 deb 	 ris 	 	,	you	can	take	these	 bur 	 lap 	 	 s 	 ack 	 s 	 	and	put	them	 down 	 stream 	 	from	a	farm	that	's	producing	e.	coli	,	or	other	 waste 	 s 	 	,	or	a	 factor 	 y 	 	with	chemical	 toxin 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 lead 	 s 	 	to	 habit 	 at 	 	 resto 	 ration 	 	.
so	,	we	set	up	a	 s 	 ite 	 	in	mason	 count 	 y 	 	,	washington	,	and	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	a	 dramat 	 ic 	 	 de 	 crease 	 	in	the	amount	of	 coli 	 form 	 s 	 	.

 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 log 	 arithmic 	 	scale	,	10	to	the	eighth	power	.
there	's	more	than	a	100	million	 colon 	 ies 	 	per	gram	,	and	10	to	the	third	power	is	around	1,000	.
in	48	 hour 	 s 	 	to	72	 hour 	 s 	 	,	these	three	mushroom	species	 reduc 	 ed 	 	the	amount	of	 coli 	 form 	 	bacteria	10,000	 time 	 s 	 	.

and	so	,	for	the	first	time	,	i	am	 show 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
we	have	three	different	 s 	 train 	 s 	 	of	agarikon	 mushroom 	 s 	 	 high 	 ly 	 	active	against	flu	viruses	.
here	's	the	 select 	 ivity 	 	index	 number 	 s 	 	--	against	pox	,	you	saw	10s	and	20s	--	now	against	flu	viruses	,	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	the	ribavirin	 control 	 s 	 	,	we	have	an	 extra 	 ordinari 	 ly 	 	high	activity	.
and	we	're	using	a	natural	 ex 	 tract 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	same	 do 	 s 	 age 	 	window	 a 	 s 	 	a	 pur 	 e 	 	pharmaceutical	.
we	 tri 	 ed 	 	it	against	flu	a	viruses	--	h	1n1	,	h	3n2	--	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	flu	b	viruses	.
so	then	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	a	blend	,	and	in	a	blend	combination	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	it	against	h	5n1	,	and	we	got	 great 	 er 	 	than	1,000	 select 	 ivity 	 	index	.
i	then	think	that	we	can	make	the	argument	that	we	should	 s 	 ave 	 	the	old	-	growth	forest	 a 	 s 	 	a	matter	of	national	defense	.
i	 be 	 came 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 entomo 	 pathogen 	 ic 	 	fungi	--	fungi	that	kill	 insect 	 s 	 	.
our	house	was	 be 	 ing 	 	 destroy 	 ed 	 	by	 carp 	 enter 	 	ants	.
so	,	i	went	to	the	epa	 home 	 page 	 	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 recommend 	 ing 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	with	 meta 	 rhiz 	 ium 	 	species	of	a	group	of	fungi	that	kill	 carp 	 enter 	 	ants	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 term 	 ites 	 	.
i	did	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 no 	 body 	 	else	had	 d 	 one 	 	.
i	 actual 	 ly 	 	 chase 	 d 	 	the	 mycel 	 ium 	 	,	when	it	 stop 	 ped 	 	producing	 s 	 pore 	 s 	 	.
these	are	 s 	 pore 	 s 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 s 	 pore 	 s 	 	.
i	was	able	to	morph	the	culture	 in 	 to 	 	a	non	-	 sporulat 	 ing 	 	form	.
and	so	the	industry	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 pent 	 	over	100	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	 specific 	 ally 	 	on	bait	 station 	 s 	 	to	prevent	 term 	 ites 	 	from	eating	your	house	.
but	the	 insect 	 s 	 	are	n't	stupid	,	and	they	would	avoid	the	 s 	 pore 	 s 	 	when	they	came	close	,	and	so	i	 morph 	 ed 	 	the	 culture 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	non	-	 sporulat 	 ing 	 	form	.
and	i	got	my	daughter	's	barbie	doll	dish	,	i	put	it	right	where	a	bunch	of	 carp 	 enter 	 	ants	 we 	 re 	 	making	 deb 	 ris 	 	 field 	 s 	 	,	every	day	,	in	my	house	,	and	the	ants	 we 	 re 	 	 attract 	 ed 	 	to	the	 mycel 	 ium 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	no	 s 	 pore 	 s 	 	.
they	 g 	 ave 	 	it	to	the	 que 	 en 	 	.
one	week	 lat 	 er 	 	,	i	had	no	 saw 	 dust 	 	 pile 	 s 	 	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	.
and	then	--	a	 delic 	 ate 	 	dance	between	 d 	 inner 	 	and	death	--	the	 mycel 	 ium 	 	is	 consum 	 ed 	 	by	the	ants	,	they	 be 	 come 	 	 mum 	 m 	 ified 	 	,	and	,	 bo 	 ing 	 	,	a	mushroom	 pop 	 s 	 	out	of	 the 	 ir 	 	head	.
now	after	 sporulat 	 ion 	 	,	the	 s 	 pore 	 s 	 	repel	.
so	,	the	house	is	no	 long 	 er 	 	 suit 	 able 	 	for	invasion	.
so	,	you	have	a	near	-	permanent	solution	for	 re 	 invasion 	 	of	 term 	 ites 	 	.
and	so	my	house	came	down	,	i	 receiv 	 ed 	 	my	first	patent	against	 carp 	 enter 	 	ants	,	 term 	 ites 	 	and	fire	ants	.
then	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	 ex 	 tract 	 s 	 	,	and	lo	and	 be 	 hold 	 	,	we	can	steer	 insect 	 s 	 	to	different	 direction 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	huge	 implic 	 ations 	 	.
i	then	 receiv 	 ed 	 	my	second	patent	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	big	one	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	an	alexander	graham	bell	patent	.	it	 cover 	 s 	 	over	200,000	species	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	most	 disrupt 	 ive 	 	technology	--	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	told	by	 ex 	 ecutive 	 s 	 	of	the	 pest 	 icide 	 	industry	--	that	they	have	ever	 witness 	 ed 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	could	 total 	 ly 	 	revamp	the	 pest 	 icide 	 	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	world	.
you	could	fly	100	ph.d.	 student 	 s 	 	under	the	 um 	 br 	 ella 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 cept 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	my	 s 	 up 	 position 	 	is	that	 entomo 	 pathogen 	 ic 	 	fungi	,	prior	to	 sporulat 	 ion 	 	,	attract	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 insect 	 s 	 
that	are	 other 	 wise 	 	 repel 	 led 	 	by	 t 	 hose 	 	 s 	 pore 	 s 	 	.
and	so	i	came	up	with	a	life	box	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 need 	 ed 	 	a	 deliver 	 y 	 	system	.
the	life	box	--	you	're	gon	na	be	 get 	 ting 	 	a	dvd	of	the	ted	 con 	 ference 	 	--	you	add	 s 	 oil 	 	,	you	add	water	,	you	have	 myco 	 rrhizal 	 	and	 endo 	 phy 	 tic 	 	fungi	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 s 	 pore 	 s 	 	,	like	of	the	agarikon	mushroom	.
the	 seed 	 s 	 	then	are	 mother 	 ed 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	 mycel 	 ium 	 	.	and	then	you	put	tree	 seed 	 s 	 	in	here	,	and	then	you	end	up	growing	--	 potential 	 ly 	 	--	an	old	-	growth	forest	from	a	 card 	 board 	 	box	.
i	want	to	 re 	 invent 	 	the	 deliver 	 y 	 	system	,	and	the	use	of	 card 	 board 	 	around	the	world	,	so	they	 be 	 come 	 	 eco 	 logical 	 	 foot 	 print 	 s 	 	.
if	there	's	a	youtube	-	like	 s 	 ite 	 	that	you	could	put	up	,	you	could	make	it	 inter 	 active 	 	,	zip	code	specific	--	where	people	could	join	together	,	and	through	satellite	 im 	 aging 	 	 system 	 s 	 	,	through	virtual	earth	or	google	earth	,	you	could	confirm	carbon	 credit 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 sequest 	 er 	 ed 	 
by	the	 tree 	 s 	 	that	are	coming	through	life	boxes	.
you	could	take	a	 card 	 board 	 	box	 deliver 	 ing 	 	 shoe 	 s 	 	,	you	could	add	water	--	i	 develop 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	for	the	 refuge 	 e 	 	community	--	 corn 	 s 	 	,	 bean 	 s 	 	and	squash	and	 on 	 ions 	 	.
i	took	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 contain 	 ers 	 	--	my	wife	 s 	 aid 	 	,	if	i	could	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	 any 	 body 	 	could	--	and	i	 end 	 ed 	 	up	growing	a	seed	garden	.	then	you	harvest	the	 seed 	 s 	 	--	and	thank	you	,	eric	rasmussen	,	for	your	help	on	 th 	 is 	 	--	and	then	you	're	 harvest 	 ing 	 	the	seed	garden	.
then	you	can	harvest	the	 ker 	 nel 	 s 	 	,	and	then	you	just	need	a	few	 ker 	 nel 	 s 	 	.	i	add	 mycel 	 ium 	 	to	it	,	and	then	i	 inocul 	 ate 	 	the	 corn 	 cob 	 s 	 	.
now	,	three	 corn 	 cob 	 s 	 	,	no	other	grain	--	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 mushroom 	 s 	 	begin	to	form	.	too	 man 	 y 	 	 withdraw 	 al 	 s 	 	from	the	carbon	bank	,	and	so	 th 	 is 	 	population	will	be	shut	down	.
but	watch	what	 happen 	 s 	 	here	.
the	 mushroom 	 s 	 	then	are	 harvest 	 ed 	 	,	but	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	the	 mycel 	 ium 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 convert 	 ed 	 	the	 cell 	 u 	 lose 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 f 	 ung 	 al 	 	 sugar 	 s 	 	.
and	so	i	thought	,	how	could	we	address	the	energy	crisis	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	?
and	we	came	up	with	econol	.
generating	ethanol	from	 cell 	 u 	 lose 	 	using	 mycel 	 ium 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	 inter 	 media 	 ry 	 	--	and	you	gain	all	the	 benefit 	 s 	 	that	i	've	 de 	 scribed 	 	to	you	 al 	 ready 	 	.
but	to	go	from	 cell 	 u 	 lose 	 	to	ethanol	is	 eco 	 logically 	 	 un 	 intelligent 	 	,	and	i	think	that	we	need	to	be	 eco 	 no 	 logically 	 	intelligent	about	the	generation	of	 fuel 	 s 	 	.
so	,	we	build	the	carbon	 bank 	 s 	 	on	the	planet	,	renew	the	 s 	 oil 	 s 	 	.	these	are	a	species	that	we	need	to	join	with	.
i	think	 engag 	 ing 	 	 mycel 	 ium 	 	can	help	 s 	 ave 	 	the	world	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
