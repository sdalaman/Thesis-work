now	when	we	think	of	our	 sense 	 s 	 	,	we	do	n't	 usual 	 ly 	 	think	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	why	they	 prob 	 ably 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	,	from	a	 bio 	 logical 	 	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	.
we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	think	of	the	 evolution 	 ary 	 	need	to	be	 protect 	 ed 	 	by	our	 sense 	 s 	 	,	but	that	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	why	our	 sense 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	--	to	keep	us	safe	,	to	allow	us	to	live	.
 re 	 ally 	 	when	we	think	of	our	 sense 	 s 	 	,	or	when	we	think	of	the	loss	of	the	sense	,	we	 re 	 ally 	 	think	about	 some 	 thing 	 	more	like	 th 	 is 	 	:	the	ability	to	touch	 some 	 thing 	 	 luxur 	 ious 	 	,	to	taste	 some 	 thing 	 	 delic 	 ious 	 	,	to	smell	 some 	 thing 	 	 fragr 	 ant 	 	,	to	see	 some 	 thing 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	want	out	of	our	 sense 	 s 	 	.
we	want	 beaut 	 y 	 	;	we	do	n't	just	want	function	.
and	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	 sensor 	 y 	 	 resto 	 ration 	 	,	we	're	still	 ver 	 y 	 	far	away	from	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	provide	 beaut 	 y 	 	.
and	that	's	what	i	'd	like	to	talk	to	you	a	little	bit	about	 to 	 day 	 	.
 like 	 wise 	 	for	 hear 	 ing 	 	.
when	we	think	about	why	we	hear	,	we	do	n't	often	think	about	the	ability	to	hear	an	alarm	or	a	siren	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	 clear 	 ly 	 	that	's	an	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	.
 re 	 ally 	 	what	we	want	to	hear	is	music	.
so	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	know	that	that	's	beethoven	's	 seven 	 th 	 	 sym 	 phony 	 	.
 man 	 y 	 	of	you	know	that	he	was	deaf	,	or	near	 pro 	 found 	 ly 	 	deaf	,	when	he	wrote	that	.
how	 un 	 usual 	 	it	is	that	we	can	hear	music	.
music	is	just	one	of	the	 strange 	 st 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	there	is	.
it	's	acoustic	 vibration 	 s 	 	in	the	air	,	little	 wave 	 s 	 	of	energy	in	the	air	that	tickle	our	 ear 	 drum 	 	.
 some 	 how 	 	in	 tick 	 ling 	 	our	 ear 	 drum 	 	that	 transmit 	 s 	 	energy	down	our	 hear 	 ing 	 	 bone 	 s 	 	,	which	get	 convert 	 ed 	 	to	a	fluid	impulse	 in 	 side 	 	the	cochlea	and	then	 some 	 how 	 	 convert 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	an	 electric 	 al 	 	signal	in	our	 audit 	 ory 	 	 nerve 	 s 	 	that	 some 	 how 	 	wind	up	in	our	 brain 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 per 	 ception 	 	of	a	song	or	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	piece	of	music	.
that	process	is	 entire 	 ly 	 	abstract	and	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 usual 	 	.
and	we	could	discuss	that	 top 	 ic 	 	 al 	 one 	 	for	 day 	 s 	 	to	 re 	 ally 	 	try	to	figure	out	,	how	is	it	that	we	hear	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	 emotion 	 al 	 	from	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 start 	 s 	 	out	 a 	 s 	 	a	vibration	in	the	air	?
 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	if	you	have	 hear 	 ing 	 	loss	,	most	people	that	lose	 the 	 ir 	 	 hear 	 ing 	 	lose	it	at	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	cochlea	,	the	inner	ear	.
and	it	's	at	the	hair	cell	level	that	they	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
now	if	you	had	to	pick	a	sense	to	lose	,	i	have	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	honest	with	you	and	say	,	we	're	better	at	 re 	 storing 	 	 hear 	 ing 	 	than	we	are	at	 re 	 storing 	 	any	sense	that	there	is	.
in	fact	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	even	 actual 	 ly 	 	 come 	 s 	 	close	to	our	ability	to	 re 	 store 	 	 hear 	 ing 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	a	physician	and	a	surgeon	,	i	can	 confident 	 ly 	 	tell	my	 patient 	 s 	 	that	if	you	had	to	pick	a	sense	to	lose	,	we	are	the	 fur 	 th 	 est 	 	 a 	 long 	 	 medical 	 ly 	 	and	 sur 	 gical 	 ly 	 	with	 hear 	 ing 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	 music 	 ian 	 	,	i	can	tell	you	that	if	i	had	to	have	a	 cochlea 	 r 	 	implant	,	i	'd	be	 heart 	 broken 	 	.	i	'd	just	be	 plain 	 ly 	 	 heart 	 broken 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	know	that	music	would	never	sound	the	same	to	me	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	video	that	i	'm	going	to	show	you	of	a	girl	who	's	born	deaf	.
she	's	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 support 	 ive 	 	environment	.
her	mother	's	 do 	 ing 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	she	can	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	play	that	video	 pleas 	 e 	 	.
mother	:	that	's	an	owl	.

owl	.	owl	.
 yea 	 h 	 	.

you	want	it	?
charles	limb	:	now	 de 	 spite 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	going	for	 th 	 is 	 	child	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	family	support	and	simple	 in 	 fused 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	,	there	is	a	 limit 	 ation 	 	to	what	a	child	who	's	deaf	,	an	infant	who	was	born	deaf	,	 ha 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	world	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	social	,	 education 	 al 	 	,	 voc 	 ation 	 al 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	.
i	'm	not	 say 	 ing 	 	that	they	ca	n't	live	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	 wonder 	 ful 	 	life	.
i	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	that	they	're	going	to	face	 obstacle 	 s 	 	that	most	people	who	have	normal	 hear 	 ing 	 	will	not	have	to	face	.
now	 hear 	 ing 	 	loss	and	the	 treat 	 ment 	 	for	 hear 	 ing 	 	loss	 ha 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	in	the	past	200	 year 	 s 	 	.
i	mean	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	they	used	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	like	stick	ear	-	shaped	 object 	 s 	 	onto	your	 ear 	 s 	 	and	stick	 funnel 	 s 	 	in	.
and	that	was	the	best	you	could	do	for	 hear 	 ing 	 	loss	.
back	then	you	could	n't	even	look	at	the	 ear 	 drum 	 	.
so	it	's	not	too	surprising	that	there	 we 	 re 	 	no	good	 treat 	 ments 	 	for	 hear 	 ing 	 	loss	.
and	now	 to 	 day 	 	we	have	the	modern	multi	-	channel	 cochlea 	 r 	 	implant	,	which	is	an	 out 	 patient 	 	procedure	.
it	's	 sur 	 gical 	 ly 	 	 place 	 d 	 	 in 	 side 	 	the	inner	ear	.
it	 take 	 s 	 	about	an	hour	and	a	half	to	two	 hour 	 s 	 	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	where	it	's	 d 	 one 	 	,	under	general	 an 	 est 	 hesia 	 	.
and	in	the	end	,	you	 achiev 	 e 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	where	an	 electro 	 de 	 	array	is	 insert 	 ed 	 	 in 	 side 	 	the	cochlea	.
now	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 quit 	 e 	 	 crud 	 e 	 	in	 compar 	 ison 	 	to	our	regular	inner	ear	.
but	here	is	that	same	girl	who	is	 implant 	 ed 	 	now	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	her	10	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	video	that	was	taken	by	my	 sur 	 gical 	 	mentor	,	dr.	john	niparko	,	who	 implant 	 ed 	 	her	.
if	we	could	play	 th 	 is 	 	video	 pleas 	 e 	 	.
john	niparko	:	so	you	've	written	two	 book 	 s 	 	?
girl	:	i	have	written	two	 book 	 s 	 	.
girl	:	no	,	the	other	one	was	a	book	.
jn	:	well	 th 	 is 	 	book	 ha 	 s 	 	seven	 chapter 	 s 	 	,	and	the	last	chapter	is	 en 	 titled 	 	``	the	good	 thing 	 s 	 	about	 be 	 ing 	 	deaf	.	``	do	you	remember	writing	that	chapter	?
girl	:	 y 	 es 	 	i	do	.	i	remember	writing	every	chapter	.
jn	:	 yea 	 h 	 	.
girl	:	well	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	my	sister	can	be	kind	of	 annoy 	 ing 	 	.
so	it	 come 	 s 	 	in	 hand 	 y 	 	to	not	be	 annoy 	 ed 	 	by	her	.
jn	:	i	see	.	and	who	is	that	?
girl	:	holly	.
mother	:	her	sister	.	girl	:	my	sister	.
jn	:	and	how	can	you	avoid	 be 	 ing 	 	 annoy 	 ed 	 	by	her	?
girl	:	i	just	take	off	my	ci	,	and	i	do	n't	hear	 any 	 thing 	 	.
it	 come 	 s 	 	in	 hand 	 y 	 	.
jn	:	so	you	do	n't	want	to	hear	 every 	 thing 	 	that	's	out	there	?
girl	:	no	.
cl	:	and	so	she	's	 phenomen 	 al 	 	.
and	there	's	no	way	that	you	ca	n't	look	at	that	 a 	 s 	 	an	 overwhelm 	 ing 	 	success	.
it	is	.	it	's	a	huge	success	story	in	modern	medicine	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	 de 	 spite 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	 facil 	 ity 	 	that	some	 cochlea 	 r 	 	implant	 user 	 s 	 	 dis 	 play 	 	with	language	,	you	turn	on	the	radio	and	all	of	a	sudden	they	ca	n't	hear	music	 al 	 most 	 	at	all	.
in	fact	,	most	implant	 user 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	struggle	and	 dis 	 like 	 	music	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 sound 	 s 	 	so	bad	.
and	so	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	 re 	 storing 	 	 beaut 	 y 	 	to	 some 	 body 	 	's	life	,	we	have	a	long	way	to	go	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	audition	.
now	there	are	a	lot	of	 reason 	 s 	 	for	that	.
i	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	the	fact	that	music	is	a	different	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	abstract	.
language	is	 ver 	 y 	 	different	.	language	is	 ver 	 y 	 	precise	.
in	fact	,	the	whole	reason	we	use	it	is	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	semantic	-	 specific 	 ity 	 	.
when	you	say	a	word	,	what	you	care	is	that	word	was	 perceive 	 d 	 	 correct 	 ly 	 	.
you	do	n't	care	that	the	word	 sound 	 ed 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	when	it	was	spoken	.
music	is	 entire 	 ly 	 	different	.
when	you	hear	music	,	if	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	sound	good	,	what	's	the	point	?
there	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	little	point	in	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	music	when	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	sound	good	to	you	.
the	 acoustic 	 s 	 	of	music	are	much	 hard 	 er 	 	than	 t 	 hose 	 	of	language	.
and	you	can	see	on	 th 	 is 	 	figure	,	that	the	frequency	range	and	the	decibel	range	,	the	dynamic	range	of	music	is	far	more	heterogeneous	.
so	if	we	had	to	design	a	perfect	 cochlea 	 r 	 	implant	,	what	we	would	try	to	do	is	target	it	to	be	able	to	allow	music	 trans 	 mission 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	 al 	 ways 	 	view	music	 a 	 s 	 	the	pinnacle	of	 hear 	 ing 	 	.
if	you	can	hear	music	,	you	should	be	able	to	hear	 any 	 thing 	 	.
now	the	 problem 	 s 	 	begin	first	with	pitch	 per 	 ception 	 	.
i	mean	,	most	of	us	know	that	pitch	is	a	fundamental	building	block	of	music	.
and	 with 	 out 	 	the	ability	to	perceive	pitch	well	,	music	and	 melo 	 dy 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	thing	to	do	--	forget	about	a	 harmon 	 y 	 	and	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	midi	 arrange 	 ment 	 	of	rachmaninoff	's	 pre 	 lude 	 	.
now	if	we	could	just	play	 th 	 is 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	now	if	we	consider	that	in	a	 cochlea 	 r 	 	implant	patient	pitch	 per 	 ception 	 	could	be	off	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	two	 octave 	 s 	 	,	let	's	see	what	 happen 	 s 	 	here	when	we	 random 	 ize 	 	 th 	 is 	 	to	 with 	 in 	 	one	 semi 	 tone 	 	.
we	would	be	 thrill 	 ed 	 	if	we	had	one	 semi 	 tone 	 	pitch	 per 	 ception 	 	in	 cochlea 	 r 	 	implant	 user 	 s 	 	.
go	 a 	 head 	 	and	play	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
now	my	goal	in	 show 	 ing 	 	you	that	is	to	show	you	that	music	is	not	 ro 	 bust 	 	to	degradation	.
you	distort	it	a	little	bit	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	pitch	,	and	you	've	 change 	 d 	 	it	.
and	it	might	be	that	you	kind	of	like	that	.
that	's	kind	of	 hypno 	 tic 	 	.
but	it	 certain 	 ly 	 	was	n't	the	way	the	music	was	 intend 	 ed 	 	.
and	you	're	not	 hear 	 ing 	 	the	same	thing	that	most	people	who	have	normal	 hear 	 ing 	 	are	 hear 	 ing 	 	.
not	just	the	ability	to	tell	 pitch 	 es 	 	 a 	 part 	 	,	but	the	ability	to	tell	 sound 	 s 	 	 a 	 part 	 	.
most	 cochlea 	 r 	 	implant	 user 	 s 	 	can	not	tell	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	an	instrument	.
if	we	could	play	these	two	sound	 clip 	 s 	 	in	 success 	 ion 	 	.
the	 trump 	 et 	 	.
and	the	second	one	.
that	's	a	 viol 	 in 	 	.
these	have	similar	wave	 form 	 s 	 	.	they	're	both	 sustain 	 ed 	 	 instrument 	 s 	 	.
 cochlea 	 r 	 	implant	 user 	 s 	 	can	not	tell	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	these	 instrument 	 s 	 	.
the	sound	quality	,	or	the	sound	of	the	sound	is	how	i	like	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	 tim 	 b 	 re 	 	,	tone	color	--	they	can	not	tell	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	implant	is	not	 transmit 	 ting 	 	the	quality	of	music	that	 usual 	 ly 	 	 provide 	 s 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 warm 	 th 	 	.
now	if	you	look	at	the	brain	of	an	individual	who	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 cochlea 	 r 	 	implant	and	you	have	them	listen	to	speech	,	have	them	listen	to	rhythm	and	have	them	listen	to	 melo 	 dy 	 	,	what	you	find	is	that	the	 audit 	 ory 	 	cortex	is	the	most	active	 dur 	 ing 	 	speech	.
you	would	think	that	 be 	 cause 	 	these	 implant 	 s 	 	are	 optimize 	 d 	 	for	speech	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	designed	for	speech	.
but	 actual 	 ly 	 	if	you	look	at	 melo 	 dy 	 	,	what	you	find	is	that	there	's	 ver 	 y 	 	little	 cort 	 ical 	 	activity	in	implant	 user 	 s 	 	 compar 	 ed 	 	with	normal	 hear 	 ing 	 	 control 	 s 	 	.
so	for	 what 	 ever 	 	reason	,	 th 	 is 	 	implant	is	not	 success 	 fully 	 	 stimul 	 ating 	 	 audit 	 ory 	 	 cort 	 ice 	 s 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	 melo 	 dy 	 	 per 	 ception 	 	.
now	the	next	question	is	,	well	how	 do 	 es 	 	it	 re 	 ally 	 	sound	?
now	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	some	 stud 	 ies 	 	to	 re 	 ally 	 	get	a	sense	of	what	sound	quality	is	like	for	these	implant	 user 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	play	you	two	 clip 	 s 	 	of	 us 	 her 	 	,	one	which	is	normal	and	one	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 most 	 	no	high	 fr 	 equ 	 encies 	 	,	 al 	 most 	 	no	low	 fr 	 equ 	 encies 	 	and	not	even	that	 man 	 y 	 	mid	 fr 	 equ 	 encies 	 	.
go	 a 	 head 	 	and	play	that	.
i	had	 patient 	 s 	 	tell	me	that	 t 	 hose 	 	sound	the	same	.
they	can	not	 different 	 iate 	 	sound	quality	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	between	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 clip 	 s 	 	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	we	are	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	far	away	in	just	 get 	 ting 	 	to	where	we	want	to	get	to	.
now	the	question	 come 	 s 	 	to	mind	:	is	there	any	hope	?
and	 y 	 es 	 	,	there	is	hope	.
now	i	do	n't	know	if	 any 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	who	 th 	 is 	 	is	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	...	 do 	 es 	 	 some 	 body 	 	know	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	beethoven	.
now	why	would	we	know	what	beethoven	's	skull	 look 	 s 	 	like	?
 be 	 cause 	 	his	grave	was	 ex 	 hum 	 ed 	 	.
and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	his	temporal	 bone 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 harvest 	 ed 	 	when	he	 di 	 ed 	 	to	try	to	look	at	the	cause	of	his	 deaf 	 ness 	 	,	which	is	why	he	 ha 	 s 	 	 mold 	 ing 	 	clay	and	his	skull	is	 bulg 	 ing 	 	out	on	the	side	there	.
but	beethoven	 compose 	 d 	 	music	long	after	he	lost	his	 hear 	 ing 	 	.
what	that	 suggest 	 s 	 	is	that	,	even	in	the	case	of	 hear 	 ing 	 	loss	,	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	for	music	 remain 	 s 	 	.
the	 brain 	 s 	 	remain	 hard 	 wired 	 	for	music	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	to	work	with	dr.	david	ryugo	where	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	deaf	 cat 	 s 	 	that	are	white	and	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	we	give	them	 cochlea 	 r 	 	 implant 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	cat	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	trained	to	respond	to	a	 trump 	 et 	 	for	food	.

if	we	 we 	 re 	 	to	direct	 effort 	 s 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	training	 cochlea 	 r 	 	implant	 user 	 s 	 	to	hear	music	--	 be 	 cause 	 	right	now	there	's	 virtual 	 ly 	 	no	effort	put	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	that	,	no	 rehabilit 	 ative 	 	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	little	in	the	way	of	 techno 	 logical 	 	 advance 	 s 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	improve	music	--	we	would	come	a	long	way	.
now	i	want	to	show	you	one	last	video	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	of	a	student	of	mine	named	joseph	who	i	had	the	good	fortune	to	work	with	for	three	 year 	 s 	 	in	my	lab	.
he	's	deaf	,	and	he	 learn 	 ed 	 	to	play	the	piano	after	he	 receiv 	 ed 	 	the	 cochlea 	 r 	 	implant	.
and	here	's	a	video	of	joseph	.
joseph	:	i	was	born	in	1986	.
and	at	about	four	 month 	 s 	 	old	,	i	was	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	with	 pro 	 found 	 ly 	 	severe	 hear 	 ing 	 	loss	.
not	long	after	,	i	was	fitted	with	 hear 	 ing 	 	 aid 	 s 	 	.
but	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	these	 hear 	 ing 	 	 aid 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	the	most	 power 	 ful 	 	 hear 	 ing 	 	 aid 	 s 	 	on	the	market	at	the	time	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 ver 	 y 	 	 help 	 ful 	 	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	,	i	had	to	 re 	 ly 	 	on	lip	 read 	 ing 	 	a	lot	,	and	i	could	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	hear	what	people	 we 	 re 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	.
when	i	was	12	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	i	was	one	of	the	first	few	people	in	singapore	who	 under 	 went 	 	 cochlea 	 r 	 	 implant 	 ation 	 	.
and	not	long	after	i	got	my	 cochlea 	 r 	 	implant	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	how	to	play	piano	.
and	it	was	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	.
since	then	,	i	've	never	 look 	 ed 	 	back	.
cl	:	joseph	is	 phenomen 	 al 	 	.	he	's	 brilli 	 ant 	 	.
he	is	now	a	medical	student	at	yale	university	,	and	he	's	 contempl 	 ating 	 	a	 sur 	 gical 	 	 care 	 er 	 	--	one	of	the	first	deaf	 individual 	 s 	 	to	consider	a	 care 	 er 	 	in	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	.
there	are	 al 	 most 	 	no	deaf	 surgeon 	 s 	 	 any 	 where 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 un 	 heard 	 	of	stuff	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	technology	.
and	the	fact	that	he	can	play	the	piano	like	that	is	a	 test 	 a 	 ment 	 	to	his	brain	.
truth	of	the	matter	is	you	can	play	the	piano	 with 	 out 	 	a	 cochlea 	 r 	 	implant	,	 be 	 cause 	 	all	you	have	to	do	is	press	the	 key 	 s 	 	at	the	right	time	.
you	do	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	to	hear	it	.
i	know	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	hear	well	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	've	heard	him	do	 kara 	 oke 	 	.
and	it	's	one	of	the	most	awful	 thing 	 s 	 	--	 heart 	 warm 	 ing 	 	,	but	awful	.
and	so	there	is	 certain 	 ly 	 	a	lot	of	hope	,	but	there	's	a	lot	more	that	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 d 	 one 	 	.
so	i	just	want	to	conclude	with	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	 word 	 s 	 	.
when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	 resto 	 ration 	 	of	 hear 	 ing 	 	,	we	have	 certain 	 ly 	 	come	a	long	way	,	a	 remark 	 ably 	 	long	way	.
and	we	have	a	much	 long 	 er 	 	way	to	go	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	the	idea	of	 re 	 storing 	 	perfect	 hear 	 ing 	 	.
and	let	me	tell	you	right	now	,	it	's	fine	that	we	would	all	be	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	with	speech	.
but	i	tell	you	,	if	we	lost	our	 hear 	 ing 	 	,	if	 any 	 one 	 	here	 sudden 	 ly 	 	lost	your	 hear 	 ing 	 	,	you	would	want	perfect	 hear 	 ing 	 	back	.
you	would	n't	want	 de 	 cent 	 	 hear 	 ing 	 	,	you	would	want	perfect	 hear 	 ing 	 	.
 resto 	 ration 	 	of	 bas 	 ic 	 	 sensor 	 y 	 	function	is	critical	.
and	i	do	n't	mean	to	 under 	 state 	 	how	 import 	 ant 	 	it	is	to	 re 	 store 	 	 bas 	 ic 	 	function	.
but	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 resto 	 ration 	 	of	the	ability	to	perceive	 beaut 	 y 	 	where	we	can	get	inspiring	.
and	i	do	n't	think	that	we	should	give	up	on	 beaut 	 y 	 	.
and	i	want	to	thank	you	for	your	time	.
