when	i	was	10	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	a	cousin	of	mine	took	me	on	a	tour	of	his	medical	school	.	and	 a 	 s 	 	a	special	treat	,	he	took	me	to	the	 path 	 ology 	 	lab	and	took	a	real	human	brain	out	of	the	jar	and	 place 	 d 	 	it	in	my	 hand 	 s 	 	.
and	there	it	was	,	the	seat	of	human	 conscious 	 ness 	 	,	the	 power 	 house 	 	of	the	human	body	,	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	my	 hand 	 s 	 	.
and	that	day	i	 k 	 new 	 	that	when	i	grew	up	,	i	was	going	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	brain	doctor	,	scientist	,	 some 	 thing 	 	or	the	other	.
 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	when	i	 final 	 ly 	 	grew	up	,	my	dream	came	true	.
and	it	was	while	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	my	ph.d.	on	the	 neuro 	 logical 	 	 cause 	 s 	 	of	 dy 	 s 	 le 	 xia 	 	in	children	that	i	 en 	 counter 	 ed 	 	a	 start 	 ling 	 	fact	that	i	'd	like	to	share	with	you	all	 to 	 day 	 	.
it	is	 estimate 	 d 	 	that	one	in	six	children	,	that	's	one	in	six	children	,	suffer	from	some	 develop 	 mental 	 	 dis 	 order 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 dis 	 order 	 	that	 retard 	 s 	 	mental	 develop 	 ment 	 	in	the	child	and	 cause 	 s 	 	permanent	mental	 impair 	 ments 	 	.
which	 mean 	 s 	 	that	each	and	every	one	of	you	here	 to 	 day 	 	 know 	 s 	 	at	 l 	 east 	 	one	child	that	is	 suffer 	 ing 	 	from	a	 develop 	 mental 	 	 dis 	 order 	 	.
but	here	's	what	 re 	 ally 	 	 per 	 plex 	 ed 	 	me	.
 de 	 spite 	 	the	fact	that	each	and	every	one	of	these	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	 origin 	 ates 	 	in	the	brain	,	most	of	these	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	are	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	 sole 	 ly 	 	on	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	 observ 	 able 	 	behavior	.
but	 diagnos 	 ing 	 	a	brain	 dis 	 order 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	looking	at	the	brain	is	 analog 	 ous 	 	to	 treat 	 ing 	 	a	patient	with	a	heart	problem	based	on	 the 	 ir 	 	physical	 symptom 	 s 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	even	 do 	 ing 	 	an	ecg	or	a	chest	x	-	ray	to	look	at	the	heart	.
it	 seem 	 ed 	 	so	intuitive	to	me	.
to	 diagnos 	 e 	 	and	treat	a	brain	 dis 	 order 	 	 accurate 	 ly 	 	,	it	would	be	 necess 	 ary 	 	to	look	at	the	brain	 direct 	 ly 	 	.
looking	at	behavior	 al 	 one 	 	can	 mis 	 s 	 	a	vital	piece	of	the	 puzzl 	 e 	 	and	provide	an	 in 	 complete 	 	,	or	even	a	 mis 	 lead 	 ing 	 	,	picture	of	the	child	's	 problem 	 s 	 	.
yet	,	 de 	 spite 	 	all	the	 advance 	 s 	 	in	medical	technology	,	the	 diagnos 	 is 	 	of	brain	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	in	one	in	six	children	still	 remain 	 ed 	 	so	 limit 	 ed 	 	.
and	then	i	came	 a 	 cross 	 	a	team	at	harvard	university	that	had	taken	one	 s 	 uch 	 	 advance 	 d 	 	medical	technology	and	 final 	 ly 	 	 appli 	 ed 	 	it	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	in	brain	research	,	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 diagnos 	 ing 	 	brain	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	in	children	.
 the 	 ir 	 	 ground 	 break 	 ing 	 	technology	 record 	 s 	 	the	eeg	,	or	the	 electric 	 al 	 	activity	of	the	brain	,	in	real	time	,	 allow 	 ing 	 	us	to	watch	the	brain	 a 	 s 	 	it	 perform 	 s 	 	 vari 	 ous 	 	 function 	 s 	 	and	then	detect	even	the	 s 	 light 	 est 	 	 ab 	 normal 	 ity 	 	in	any	of	these	 function 	 s 	 	:	vision	,	attention	,	language	,	audition	.
a	program	 call 	 ed 	 	brain	 electric 	 al 	 	activity	mapping	then	 triangulate 	 s 	 	the	source	of	that	 ab 	 normal 	 ity 	 	in	the	brain	.
and	 an 	 other 	 	program	 call 	 ed 	 	 statistic 	 al 	 	 prob 	 ability 	 	mapping	then	 perform 	 s 	 	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 calcul 	 ations 	 	to	determine	 whet 	 her 	 	any	of	these	 ab 	 normal 	 ities 	 	are	 clinic 	 ally 	 	significant	,	 allow 	 ing 	 	us	to	provide	a	much	more	accurate	 neuro 	 logical 	 	 diagnos 	 is 	 	of	the	child	's	 symptom 	 s 	 	.
and	so	i	 be 	 came 	 	the	head	of	 neuro 	 physiology 	 	for	the	 clinic 	 al 	 	arm	of	 th 	 is 	 	team	,
and	we	're	 final 	 ly 	 	able	to	use	 th 	 is 	 	technology	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 help 	 ing 	 	children	with	brain	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'm	happy	to	say	that	i	'm	now	in	the	process	of	setting	up	 th 	 is 	 	technology	here	in	india	.
i	'd	like	to	tell	you	about	one	 s 	 uch 	 	child	,	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	story	was	 al 	 so 	 	 cover 	 ed 	 	by	abc	news	.
seven	-	year	-	old	justin	senigar	came	to	our	clinic	with	 th 	 is 	 	 diagnos 	 is 	 	of	 ver 	 y 	 	severe	 aut 	 ism 	 	.
like	 man 	 y 	 	 aut 	 istic 	 	children	,	his	mind	was	 lock 	 ed 	 	 in 	 side 	 	his	body	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	 moment 	 s 	 	when	he	would	 actual 	 ly 	 	space	out	for	 second 	 s 	 	at	a	time	.
and	the	 doctor 	 s 	 	told	his	 parent 	 s 	 	he	was	never	going	to	be	able	to	communicate	or	interact	 social 	 ly 	 	,	and	he	would	 prob 	 ably 	 	never	have	too	much	language	.
when	we	used	 th 	 is 	 	 ground 	 break 	 ing 	 	eeg	technology	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	look	at	justin	's	brain	,	the	 result 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 start 	 ling 	 	.
it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	that	justin	was	 al 	 most 	 	 certain 	 ly 	 	not	 aut 	 istic 	 	.
he	was	 suffer 	 ing 	 	from	brain	 seizure 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	to	see	with	the	naked	eye	,	but	that	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 caus 	 ing 	 	 symptom 	 s 	 	that	 mimic 	 ked 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	of	 aut 	 ism 	 	.
after	justin	was	 give 	 n 	 	anti	-	seizure	 medic 	 ation 	 	,	the	change	in	him	was	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
 with 	 in 	 	a	period	of	60	 day 	 s 	 	,	his	 vocabul 	 ary 	 	went	from	two	to	three	 word 	 s 	 	to	300	 word 	 s 	 	.
and	his	communication	and	social	 interact 	 ion 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 improv 	 ed 	 	so	 dramat 	 ically 	 	that	he	was	 enroll 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	regular	school	and	even	 be 	 came 	 	a	 kar 	 ate 	 	super	champ	.
research	 show 	 s 	 	that	50	percent	of	children	,	 al 	 most 	 	50	percent	of	children	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	with	 aut 	 ism 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 suffer 	 ing 	 	from	 hid 	 den 	 	brain	 seizure 	 s 	 	.
these	are	the	 face 	 s 	 	of	the	children	that	i	have	tested	with	 st 	 ories 	 	just	like	justin	.
all	these	children	came	to	our	clinic	with	a	 diagnos 	 is 	 	of	 aut 	 ism 	 	,	attention	 defici 	 t 	 	 dis 	 order 	 	,	mental	 retard 	 ation 	 	,	language	 problem 	 s 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	our	eeg	 s 	 can 	 s 	 	 reveal 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	specific	 problem 	 s 	 	 hid 	 den 	 	 with 	 in 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 brain 	 s 	 	that	could	n't	possibly	have	 be 	 en 	 	 detect 	 ed 	 	by	 the 	 ir 	 	 behavior 	 al 	 	 assess 	 ments 	 	.
so	these	eeg	 s 	 can 	 s 	 	enabled	us	to	provide	these	children	with	a	much	more	accurate	 neuro 	 logical 	 	 diagnos 	 is 	 	and	much	more	 target 	 ed 	 	 treat 	 ment 	 	.
for	too	long	now	,	children	with	 develop 	 mental 	 	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	have	 suffer 	 ed 	 	from	 mis 	 diagnos 	 is 	 	while	 the 	 ir 	 	real	 problem 	 s 	 	have	gone	 un 	 detect 	 ed 	 	and	left	to	worsen	.
and	for	too	long	,	these	children	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	have	 suffer 	 ed 	 	 un 	 due 	 	 frust 	 ration 	 	and	 de 	 s 	 per 	 ation 	 	.
but	we	are	now	in	a	new	era	of	 neuro 	 science 	 	,	one	in	which	we	can	 final 	 ly 	 	look	 direct 	 ly 	 	at	brain	function	in	real	time	with	no	 risk 	 s 	 	and	no	side	 effect 	 s 	 	,	non	-	 invasive 	 ly 	 	,	and	find	the	true	source	of	so	 man 	 y 	 	 dis 	 abilities 	 	in	children	.
so	if	i	could	inspire	even	a	fraction	of	you	in	the	audience	 to 	 day 	 	to	share	 th 	 is 	 	 pioneer 	 ing 	 	 diagnos 	 tic 	 	approach	with	even	one	parent	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	child	is	 suffer 	 ing 	 	from	a	 develop 	 mental 	 	 dis 	 order 	 	,	then	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	one	more	 puzzl 	 e 	 	in	one	more	brain	will	be	 solve 	 d 	 	.
one	more	mind	will	be	 un 	 lock 	 ed 	 	.
and	one	more	child	who	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 mis 	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	or	even	 un 	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	by	the	system	will	 final 	 ly 	 	 real 	 ize 	 	his	or	her	true	potential	while	there	's	still	time	for	his	or	her	brain	to	 re 	 cover 	 	.
and	all	 th 	 is 	 	by	 simpl 	 y 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	the	child	's	 brain 	 wave 	 s 	 	.
thank	you	.
