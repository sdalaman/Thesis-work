when	i	was	growing	up	in	montana	,	i	had	two	 dream 	 s 	 	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	a	 paleonto 	 logist 	 	,	a	dinosaur	 paleonto 	 logist 	 	,	and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	have	a	pet	dinosaur	.
and	so	that	's	what	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 striv 	 ing 	 	for	all	of	my	life	.
i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	fortunate	early	in	my	 care 	 er 	 	.
i	was	fortunate	in	 find 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
i	was	n't	 ver 	 y 	 	good	at	 read 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	i	do	n't	read	much	of	 any 	 thing 	 	.
i	am	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 dy 	 s 	 lexic 	 	,	and	so	 read 	 ing 	 	is	the	 hard 	 est 	 	thing	i	do	.
but	 in 	 stead 	 	,	i	go	out	and	i	find	 thing 	 s 	 	.
then	i	just	pick	 thing 	 s 	 	up	.
i	 bas 	 ically 	 	practice	for	 find 	 ing 	 	money	on	the	street	.
and	i	wander	about	the	 hill 	 s 	 	,
and	i	have	found	a	few	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	i	have	 be 	 en 	 	fortunate	 en 	 ough 	 	to	find	 thing 	 s 	 	like	the	first	 egg 	 s 	 	in	the	western	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	and	the	first	baby	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	in	 nest 	 s 	 	,	the	first	dinosaur	 embryo 	 s 	 	and	massive	 accumul 	 ations 	 	of	 bone 	 s 	 	.
and	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	be	at	a	time	when	people	 we 	 re 	 	just	 start 	 ing 	 	to	begin	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	n't	the	big	,	stupid	,	green	 reptil 	 es 	 	that	people	had	thought	for	so	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	.
people	 we 	 re 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	to	get	an	idea	that	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	special	.
and	so	,	at	that	time	,	i	was	able	to	make	some	 interest 	 ing 	 	 hypo 	 these 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	with	my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	say	that	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	--	based	on	the	evidence	we	had	--	that	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	built	 nest 	 s 	 	and	lived	in	 colon 	 ies 	 	and	 car 	 ed 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	young	,	 br 	 ought 	 	food	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 bab 	 ies 	 	and	 travel 	 ed 	 	in	 gig 	 antic 	 	 herd 	 s 	 	.
so	it	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	stuff	.
i	have	gone	on	to	find	more	 thing 	 s 	 	and	discover	that	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	social	.
we	have	found	a	lot	of	evidence	that	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	from	when	they	 we 	 re 	 	 juvenile 	 s 	 	to	when	they	 we 	 re 	 	 adult 	 s 	 	.
the	 appear 	 ance 	 	of	them	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	different	--	which	it	is	in	all	social	 animal 	 s 	 	.
in	social	 group 	 s 	 	of	 animal 	 s 	 	,	the	 juvenile 	 s 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	look	different	than	the	 adult 	 s 	 	.
the	 adult 	 s 	 	can	 recogn 	 ize 	 	the	 juvenile 	 s 	 	;	the	 juvenile 	 s 	 	can	 recogn 	 ize 	 	the	 adult 	 s 	 	.
and	so	we	're	making	a	better	picture	of	what	a	dinosaur	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
and	they	did	n't	just	all	chase	 jeep 	 s 	 	around	.
but	it	is	that	social	thing	that	i	guess	 attract 	 ed 	 	michael	crichton	.
and	in	his	book	,	he	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	the	social	 animal 	 s 	 	.
and	then	steven	spielberg	,	of	course	,	 depict 	 s 	 	these	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	social	 creature 	 s 	 	.
the	theme	of	 th 	 is 	 	story	is	building	a	dinosaur	,	and	so	we	come	to	that	part	of	``	jurassic	park	.	``
michael	crichton	 re 	 ally 	 	was	one	of	the	first	people	to	talk	about	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	back	to	life	.
you	all	know	the	story	,	right	.
i	mean	,	i	 assum 	 e 	 	 every 	 one 	 	here	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 een 	 	``	jurassic	park	.	``
if	you	want	to	make	a	dinosaur	,	you	go	out	,	you	find	 your 	 self 	 	a	piece	of	 petr 	 ified 	 	tree	 s 	 ap 	 	--	 other 	 wise 	 	known	 a 	 s 	 	 am 	 ber 	 	--	that	 ha 	 s 	 	some	blood	-	 suck 	 ing 	 	 insect 	 s 	 	in	it	,	good	 one 	 s 	 	,	and	you	get	your	insect	and	you	drill	 in 	 to 	 	it	and	you	suck	out	some	dna	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 obvious 	 ly 	 	all	 insect 	 s 	 	that	 suck 	 ed 	 	blood	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 day 	 s 	 	 suck 	 ed 	 	dinosaur	dna	out	.
and	you	take	your	dna	back	to	the	 labor 	 atory 	 	and	you	clone	it	.
and	i	guess	you	inject	it	 in 	 to 	 	 may 	 be 	 	an	ostrich	egg	,	or	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	,
and	then	you	wait	,	and	,	lo	and	 be 	 hold 	 	,	out	 pop 	 s 	 	a	little	baby	dinosaur	.
and	 every 	 body 	 	's	happy	about	that	.
and	they	're	happy	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	.
they	keep	 do 	 ing 	 	it	;	they	just	keep	making	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	then	,	then	,	then	,	and	then	...
then	the	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 ing 	 	social	,	act	out	 the 	 ir 	 	 social 	 ness 	 	,
and	they	get	together	,	and	they	 conspi 	 re 	 	.	and	,	of	course	,	that	's	what	 make 	 s 	 	steven	spielberg	's	movie	--	 conspi 	 ring 	 	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	chasing	people	around	.	so	i	 assum 	 e 	 	 every 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	that	if	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	a	piece	of	 am 	 ber 	 	and	it	had	an	insect	in	it	,	and	you	 drill 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	it	,	and	you	got	 some 	 thing 	 	out	of	that	insect	,	and	you	 clon 	 ed 	 	it	,	and	you	did	it	over	and	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	,	you	'd	have	a	room	full	of	 mosquito 	 es 	 	.
and	 prob 	 ably 	 	a	whole	bunch	of	 tree 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
now	if	you	want	dinosaur	dna	,	i	say	go	to	the	dinosaur	.
so	that	's	what	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	.
back	in	1993	when	the	movie	came	out	,	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	a	grant	from	the	national	science	 found 	 ation 	 	to	attempt	to	 ex 	 tract 	 	dna	from	a	dinosaur	,
and	we	chose	the	dinosaur	on	the	left	,	a	tyrannosaurus	 r 	 ex 	 	,	which	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	nice	specimen	.	and	one	of	my	 form 	 er 	 	 doctor 	 al 	 	 student 	 s 	 	,	dr.	mary	schweitzer	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	the	 back 	 ground 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	thing	.
and	so	she	 look 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	bone	of	 th 	 is 	 	t.	 r 	 ex 	 	,	one	of	the	 t 	 high 	 	 bone 	 s 	 	,	and	she	 actual 	 ly 	 	found	some	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 structure 	 s 	 	in	there	.
they	found	these	red	 circul 	 ar 	 	-	looking	 object 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 look 	 ed 	 	,	for	all	the	world	,	like	red	blood	 cell 	 s 	 	.
and	they	're	in	what	appear	to	be	the	blood	 channel 	 s 	 	that	go	through	the	bone	.
and	so	she	thought	,	well	,	what	the	heck	.
so	she	 s 	 ampl 	 ed 	 	some	material	out	of	it	.
now	it	was	n't	dna	;	she	did	n't	find	dna	.
but	she	did	find	 hem 	 e 	 	,	which	is	the	 bio 	 logical 	 	 found 	 ation 	 	of	hemoglobin	.
and	that	was	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	.
that	was	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
that	was	--	here	we	have	65	-	million	-	year	-	old	 hem 	 e 	 	.
well	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	and	 tri 	 ed 	 	and	we	could	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	get	 any 	 thing 	 	else	out	of	it	.
so	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	went	by	,	and	then	we	 start 	 ed 	 	the	hell	creek	project	.
and	the	hell	creek	project	was	 th 	 is 	 	massive	 under 	 taking 	 	to	get	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	could	possibly	find	,	and	 hope 	 fully 	 	find	some	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	that	had	more	material	in	them	.
and	out	in	eastern	montana	there	's	a	lot	of	space	,	a	lot	of	 bad 	 land 	 s 	 	,	and	not	 ver 	 y 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	,
and	so	you	can	go	out	there	and	find	a	lot	of	stuff	.
and	we	did	find	a	lot	of	stuff	.
we	found	a	lot	of	tyrannosaurs	,	but	we	found	one	special	tyrannosaur	,	and	we	 call 	 ed 	 	it	b	-	 r 	 ex 	 	.
and	b	-	 r 	 ex 	 	was	found	under	a	thousand	cubic	 yard 	 s 	 	of	rock	.
it	was	n't	a	 ver 	 y 	 	complete	t.	 r 	 ex 	 	,	and	it	was	n't	a	 ver 	 y 	 	big	t.	 r 	 ex 	 	,	but	it	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	special	b	-	 r 	 ex 	 	.
and	i	and	my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	cut	 in 	 to 	 	it	,	and	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	determine	,	by	looking	at	lines	of	 arrest 	 ed 	 	growth	,	some	lines	in	it	,	that	b	-	 r 	 ex 	 	had	 di 	 ed 	 	at	the	age	of	16	.
we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	know	how	long	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	lived	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	n't	found	the	 old 	 est 	 	one	yet	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	one	 di 	 ed 	 	at	the	age	of	16	.
we	 g 	 ave 	 	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	to	mary	schweitzer	,	and	she	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	able	to	determine	that	b	-	 r 	 ex 	 	was	a	female	based	on	 med 	 ull 	 ary 	 	tissue	found	on	the	 in 	 side 	 	of	the	bone	.
 med 	 ull 	 ary 	 	tissue	is	the	 calc 	 ium 	 	build	-	up	,	the	 calc 	 ium 	 	 s 	 to 	 rage 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	when	an	animal	is	 pregn 	 ant 	 	,	when	a	bird	is	 pregn 	 ant 	 	.
so	here	was	the	character	that	linked	 bird 	 s 	 	and	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	.
but	mary	went	further	.
she	took	the	bone	,	and	she	 dump 	 ed 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	acid	.
now	we	all	know	that	 bone 	 s 	 	are	 fossil 	 ized 	 	,	and	so	if	you	dump	it	 in 	 to 	 	acid	,	there	should	n't	be	 any 	 thing 	 	left	.
but	there	was	 some 	 thing 	 	left	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	left	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	 flex 	 ible 	 	,	clear	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	.
and	so	here	was	the	first	soft	tissue	from	a	dinosaur	.
it	was	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	.
but	she	 al 	 so 	 	found	 osteo 	 cytes 	 	,	which	are	the	 cell 	 s 	 	that	laid	down	the	 bone 	 s 	 	.
and	try	and	try	,	we	could	not	find	dna	,	but	she	did	find	evidence	of	 protein 	 s 	 	.
but	we	thought	 may 	 be 	 	--	well	,	we	thought	 may 	 be 	 	that	the	material	was	 break 	 ing 	 	down	after	it	was	coming	out	of	the	ground	.
we	thought	 may 	 be 	 	it	was	 deterio 	 rating 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	fast	.
and	so	we	built	a	 labor 	 atory 	 	in	the	back	of	an	18	-	wheeler	 trail 	 er 	 	,	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	took	the	 labor 	 atory 	 	to	the	field	where	we	could	get	better	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
and	we	did	.	we	got	better	material	.
the	 cell 	 s 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	better	.
the	 vessel 	 s 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	better	.
found	the	protein	 collage 	 n 	 	.
i	mean	,	it	was	 wonder 	 ful 	 	stuff	.
but	it	's	not	dinosaur	dna	.
so	we	have	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	dinosaur	dna	,	and	all	dna	,	just	 break 	 s 	 	down	too	fast	.
we	're	just	not	going	to	be	able	to	do	what	they	did	in	``	jurassic	park	.	``
we	're	not	going	to	be	able	to	make	a	dinosaur	based	on	a	dinosaur	.
but	 bird 	 s 	 	are	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	.
 bird 	 s 	 	are	living	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	.
we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 class 	 ify 	 	them	 a 	 s 	 	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	.
we	now	call	them	non	-	 av 	 ian 	 	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	and	 av 	 ian 	 	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	.
so	the	non	-	 av 	 ian 	 	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	are	the	big	 clunk 	 y 	 	 one 	 s 	 	that	went	extinct	.
 av 	 ian 	 	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	are	our	modern	 bird 	 s 	 	.
so	we	do	n't	have	to	make	a	dinosaur	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 al 	 ready 	 	have	them	.
i	know	,	you	're	 a 	 s 	 	bad	 a 	 s 	 	the	sixth	-	graders	.
the	sixth	-	graders	look	at	it	and	they	say	,	``	no.	``
``	you	can	call	it	a	dinosaur	,	but	look	at	the	 velo 	 ciraptor 	 	:	the	 velo 	 ciraptor 	 	is	cool	.	``
``	the	chicken	is	not	.	``
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	our	problem	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	imagine	.
the	chicken	is	a	dinosaur	.
i	mean	it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	.
you	ca	n't	 argu 	 e 	 	with	it	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	the	 class 	 ifier 	 s 	 	and	we	've	 class 	 ified 	 	it	that	way	.
but	the	sixth	-	graders	demand	it	.
``	fix	the	chicken	.	``
so	that	's	what	i	'm	here	to	tell	you	about	:	how	we	are	going	to	fix	a	chicken	.
so	we	have	a	number	of	ways	that	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	can	fix	the	chicken	.
 be 	 cause 	 	evolution	 work 	 s 	 	,	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	some	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	.
we	'll	call	them	 bio 	 logical 	 	 mod 	 ification 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	.
we	have	 s 	 election 	 	.
and	we	know	 s 	 election 	 	 work 	 s 	 	.
we	 start 	 ed 	 	out	with	a	wolf	-	like	creature	and	we	 end 	 ed 	 	up	with	a	maltese	.
i	mean	,	that	's	--	that	's	 definite 	 ly 	 	genetic	 mod 	 ification 	 	.
or	any	of	the	other	funny	-	looking	little	 dog 	 s 	 	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	have	 trans 	 genesis 	 	.
 trans 	 genesis 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	too	.
that	's	where	you	take	a	gene	out	of	one	animal	and	stick	it	in	 an 	 other 	 	one	.
that	's	how	people	make	glofish	.
you	take	a	glow	gene	out	of	a	coral	or	a	 jelly 	 fish 	 	and	you	stick	it	in	a	 zebra 	 fish 	 	,	and	,	puff	,	they	glow	.
and	that	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	cool	.
and	they	 obvious 	 ly 	 	make	a	lot	of	money	off	of	them	.
and	now	they	're	making	glow	-	 rabbi 	 ts 	 	and	glow	-	all	-	 sort 	 s 	 	-	of	-	 thing 	 s 	 	.
i	guess	we	could	make	a	glow	chicken	.
but	i	do	n't	think	that	'll	satisfy	the	sixth	-	graders	either	.
but	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	thing	.
there	's	what	we	call	atavism	 activ 	 ation 	 	.
and	atavism	 activ 	 ation 	 	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	--	an	atavism	is	an	 ance 	 stral 	 	 character 	 istic 	 	.
you	heard	that	 occasion 	 ally 	 	children	are	born	with	 tail 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	an	 ance 	 stral 	 	 character 	 istic 	 	.
and	so	there	are	a	number	of	 atavism 	 s 	 	that	can	happen	.
 snake 	 s 	 	are	 occasion 	 ally 	 	born	with	 leg 	 s 	 	.
and	here	's	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	chicken	with	 tee 	 th 	 	.
a	fellow	by	the	name	of	matthew	harris	at	the	university	of	wisconsin	in	madison	 actual 	 ly 	 	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	a	way	to	 stimul 	 ate 	 	the	gene	for	 tee 	 th 	 	,	and	so	was	able	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	turn	the	tooth	gene	on	and	produce	 tee 	 th 	 	in	 chicken 	 s 	 	.
now	that	's	a	good	 character 	 istic 	 	.
we	can	 s 	 ave 	 	that	one	.
we	know	we	can	use	that	.
we	can	make	a	chicken	with	 tee 	 th 	 	.
that	's	 get 	 ting 	 	 close 	 r 	 	.
that	's	better	than	a	 glow 	 ing 	 	chicken	.
a	friend	of	mine	,	a	 col 	 league 	 	of	mine	,	dr.	hans	larsson	at	mcgill	university	,	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	looking	at	 atavism 	 s 	 	.
and	he	's	looking	at	them	by	looking	at	the	embryo	genesis	of	 bird 	 s 	 	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	looking	at	how	they	develop	,
and	he	's	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	how	 bird 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	lost	 the 	 ir 	 	tail	.
he	's	 al 	 so 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	 transform 	 ation 	 	of	the	arm	,	the	hand	,	to	the	wing	.
he	's	looking	for	 t 	 hose 	 	 gene 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	if	you	can	find	 t 	 hose 	 	,	i	can	just	reverse	them	and	make	what	i	need	to	make	for	the	sixth	-	graders	.	``
and	so	he	 agree 	 d 	 	.
and	so	that	's	what	we	're	looking	 in 	 to 	 	.
if	you	look	at	dinosaur	 hand 	 s 	 	,	a	 velo 	 ciraptor 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	that	cool	-	looking	hand	with	the	 claw 	 s 	 	on	it	.
 arch 	 aeopteryx 	 	,	which	is	a	bird	,	a	primitive	bird	,	still	 ha 	 s 	 	that	 ver 	 y 	 	primitive	hand	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	the	pigeon	,	or	a	chicken	or	 any 	 thing 	 	else	,	 an 	 other 	 	bird	,	 ha 	 s 	 	kind	of	a	weird	-	looking	hand	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	hand	is	a	wing	.
but	the	cool	thing	is	that	,	if	you	look	in	the	embryo	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	embryo	is	 develop 	 ing 	 	the	hand	 actual 	 ly 	 	 look 	 s 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	like	the	 arch 	 aeopteryx 	 	hand	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	the	three	 finger 	 s 	 	,	the	three	 digit 	 s 	 	.
but	a	gene	 turn 	 s 	 	on	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 fuse 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	together	.
and	so	what	we	're	looking	for	is	that	gene	.
we	want	to	stop	that	gene	from	 turn 	 ing 	 	on	,	fusing	 t 	 hose 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	together	,	so	we	can	get	a	chicken	that	 hatch 	 es 	 	out	with	a	three	-	fingered	hand	,	like	the	 arch 	 aeopteryx 	 	.
and	the	same	 go 	 es 	 	for	the	 tail 	 s 	 	.
 bird 	 s 	 	have	 bas 	 ically 	 	 rud 	 imentary 	 	 tail 	 s 	 	.
and	so	we	know	that	in	embryo	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	animal	is	 develop 	 ing 	 	,	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 relat 	 ively 	 	long	tail	.
but	a	gene	 turn 	 s 	 	on	and	 resorb 	 s 	 	the	tail	,	 get 	 s 	 	rid	of	it	.
so	that	's	the	other	gene	we	're	looking	for	.
we	want	to	stop	that	tail	from	 resorb 	 ing 	 	.
so	what	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	 re 	 ally 	 	is	take	our	chicken	,	modify	it	and	make	the	 chicken 	 o 	 saurus 	 	.
it	's	a	 cool 	 er 	 	-	looking	chicken	.
but	it	's	just	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 bas 	 ic 	 s 	 	.
so	that	 re 	 ally 	 	is	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	.
and	people	 al 	 ways 	 	say	,	``	why	do	that	?
why	make	 th 	 is 	 	thing	?
what	good	is	it	?	``
well	,	that	's	a	good	question	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	think	it	's	a	great	way	to	teach	 kid 	 s 	 	about	 evolution 	 ary 	 	biology	and	 develop 	 mental 	 	biology	and	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	 quit 	 e 	 	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	i	think	if	colonel	sanders	was	to	be	 care 	 ful 	 	how	he	 word 	 ed 	 	it	,	he	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	advertise	an	extra	piece	.
 any 	 way 	 	--	when	our	dino	-	chicken	 hatch 	 es 	 	,	it	will	be	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	the	 post 	 er 	 	child	,	or	what	you	might	call	a	 post 	 er 	 	chick	,	for	technology	,	 entertain 	 ment 	 	and	design	.
thank	you	.
