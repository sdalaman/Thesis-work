it	's	 amaz 	 ing 	 	,	when	you	meet	a	head	of	state	and	you	say	,	``	what	is	your	most	precious	natural	resource	?	``	--	they	will	not	say	children	at	first	.
and	then	when	you	say	children	,	they	will	 pre 	 tty 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	agree	with	you	.
:	we	're	 travel 	 ing 	 	 to 	 day 	 	with	the	 mini 	 ster 	 	of	defense	of	colombia	,	head	of	the	 arm 	 y 	 	and	the	head	of	the	police	,	and	we	're	dropping	off	650	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	to	children	who	have	no	 tele 	 vision 	 	,	no	 tele 	 phone 	 	and	have	 be 	 en 	 	in	a	community	cut	off	from	the	rest	of	the	world	for	the	past	40	 year 	 s 	 	.
the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	 deliver 	 ing 	 	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	region	is	 connect 	 ing 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	who	have	 other 	 wise 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 un 	 connect 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	farc	,	the	 guerrilla 	 s 	 	that	 start 	 ed 	 	off	40	 year 	 s 	 	ago	 a 	 s 	 	a	 politic 	 al 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	and	then	 be 	 came 	 	a	drug	 move 	 ment 	 	.
there	are	one	billion	children	in	the	world	,	and	50	percent	of	them	do	n't	have	 electric 	 ity 	 	at	home	or	at	school	.
and	in	some	 count 	 ries 	 	--	let	me	pick	afghanistan	--	75	percent	of	the	little	 girl 	 s 	 	do	n't	go	to	school	.
and	i	do	n't	mean	that	they	drop	out	of	school	in	the	third	or	fourth	grade	--	they	do	n't	go	.
so	in	the	three	 year 	 s 	 	since	i	 talk 	 ed 	 	at	ted	and	 show 	 ed 	 	a	prototype	,	it	's	gone	from	an	idea	to	a	real	 lap 	 top 	 	.
we	have	half	a	million	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	in	the	 hand 	 s 	 	of	children	.
we	have	about	a	quarter	of	a	million	in	transit	to	 t 	 hose 	 	and	other	children	,	and	then	there	are	 an 	 other 	 	quarter	of	a	million	more	that	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 order 	 ed 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	moment	.
so	,	in	rough	 number 	 s 	 	,	there	are	a	million	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	.
that	's	 small 	 er 	 	than	i	 predict 	 ed 	 	--	i	 predict 	 ed 	 	three	to	10	million	--	but	is	still	a	 ver 	 y 	 	large	number	.
in	colombia	,	we	have	about	3,000	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	.
it	's	the	 mini 	 ster 	 	of	defense	with	whom	we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	,	not	the	 mini 	 ster 	 	of	education	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	 s 	 een 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 strat 	 egic 	 	defense	issue	in	the	sense	of	 liber 	 ating 	 	these	 zone 	 s 	 	that	had	 be 	 en 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	closed	off	,	in	which	the	people	who	had	 be 	 en 	 	 caus 	 ing 	 	,	if	you	will	,	40	 year 	 s 	 	'	worth	of	 bomb 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	 kidnap 	 ping 	 s 	 	and	 assassin 	 ations 	 	lived	.
and	 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	the	 kid 	 s 	 	have	 connect 	 ed 	 	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	.
they	've	 leapfrog 	 ged 	 	.
the	change	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 monument 	 al 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	not	just	 open 	 ing 	 	it	up	,	but	it	's	 open 	 ing 	 	it	up	to	the	rest	of	the	world	.
so	 y 	 es 	 	,	they	're	building	 road 	 s 	 	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	they	're	 put 	 ting 	 	in	 tele 	 phone 	 	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	there	will	be	 tele 	 vision 	 	.
but	the	 kid 	 s 	 	six	to	12	 year 	 s 	 	old	are	surfing	the	 inter 	 net 	 	in	spanish	and	in	local	 language 	 s 	 	,	so	the	children	grow	up	with	access	to	information	,	with	a	window	 in 	 to 	 	the	rest	of	the	world	.
before	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	closed	off	.
 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	in	other	 count 	 ries 	 	,	it	will	be	the	 mini 	 ster 	 	of	finance	who	 s 	 ees 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	an	engine	of	economic	growth	.
and	that	engine	is	going	to	see	the	 result 	 s 	 	in	20	 year 	 s 	 	.
it	's	not	going	to	happen	,	you	know	,	in	one	year	,	but	it	's	an	 import 	 ant 	 	,	 deep 	 ly 	 	economic	and	cultural	change	that	 happen 	 s 	 	through	children	.
thirty	-	one	 count 	 ries 	 	in	total	are	 involve 	 d 	 	,	and	in	the	case	of	uruguay	,	half	the	children	 al 	 ready 	 	have	them	,	and	by	the	middle	of	2009	,	every	single	child	in	uruguay	will	have	a	 lap 	 top 	 	--	a	little	green	 lap 	 top 	 	.
now	what	are	some	of	the	 result 	 s 	 	?
some	of	the	 result 	 s 	 	that	go	 a 	 cross 	 	every	single	country	include	 teacher 	 s 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	they	have	never	 love 	 d 	 	 teach 	 ing 	 	so	much	,	and	 read 	 ing 	 	 comprehens 	 ion 	 	 measur 	 ed 	 	by	third	 part 	 ies 	 	--	not	by	us	--	 skyrocket 	 s 	 	.
 prob 	 ably 	 	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	we	see	is	children	 teach 	 ing 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	.
they	own	the	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	.	they	take	them	home	.
and	so	when	i	met	with	three	children	from	the	 school 	 s 	 	,	who	had	 travel 	 ed 	 	all	day	to	come	to	bogota	,	one	of	the	three	children	 br 	 ought 	 	her	mother	.
and	the	reason	she	 br 	 ought 	 	her	mother	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	six	-	year	-	old	child	had	 be 	 en 	 	 teach 	 ing 	 	her	mother	how	to	read	and	write	.
her	mother	had	not	gone	to	 prim 	 ary 	 	school	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 s 	 uch 	 	an	 in 	 version 	 	,	and	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	children	 be 	 ing 	 	the	 agent 	 s 	 	of	change	.
so	now	,	in	 clo 	 s 	 ing 	 	,	people	say	,	now	why	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	?
 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	are	a	 luxur 	 y 	 	;	it	's	like	giving	them	ipods	.	no	.
the	reason	you	want	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	is	that	the	word	is	education	,	not	 lap 	 top 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	education	project	,	not	a	 lap 	 top 	 	project	.
they	need	to	learn	 learn 	 ing 	 	.	and	then	,	just	think	--	they	can	have	,	let	's	say	,	100	 book 	 s 	 	.
in	a	village	,	you	have	100	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	,	each	with	a	different	set	of	100	 book 	 s 	 	,	and	so	that	village	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	10,000	 book 	 s 	 	.
you	and	i	did	n't	have	10,000	 book 	 s 	 	when	we	went	to	 prim 	 ary 	 	school	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	school	is	under	a	tree	,	or	in	 man 	 y 	 	 case 	 s 	 	,	the	teacher	 ha 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	a	fifth	-	grade	education	,	so	you	need	a	 collabor 	 ative 	 	model	of	 learn 	 ing 	 	,	not	just	building	more	 school 	 s 	 	and	training	more	 teacher 	 s 	 	,	which	you	have	to	do	 any 	 way 	 	.
so	we	're	once	 aga 	 in 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	``	give	one	,	get	one	.	``	last	year	,	we	ran	a	``	give	one	,	get	one	``	program	,	and	it	generated	over	100,000	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 
that	we	 we 	 re 	 	then	able	to	give	free	.
and	by	 be 	 ing 	 	a	zero	-	dollar	 lap 	 top 	 	,	we	can	go	to	 count 	 ries 	 	that	ca	n't	afford	it	at	all	.
and	that	's	what	we	did	.	we	went	to	 ha 	 iti 	 	,	we	went	to	rwanda	,	afghanistan	,	ethiopia	,	mongolia	.
 place 	 s 	 	that	are	not	 market 	 s 	 	,	 seed 	 ing 	 	it	with	the	 principle 	 s 	 	of	 s 	 atur 	 ation 	 	,	 connect 	 ivity 	 	,	low	 age 	 s 	 	,	etc	.
and	then	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	roll	out	large	 number 	 s 	 	.
so	think	of	it	 th 	 is 	 	way	:	think	of	it	 a 	 s 	 	 inocul 	 ating 	 	children	against	 ignor 	 ance 	 	.
and	think	of	the	 lap 	 top 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 vaccin 	 e 	 	.
you	do	n't	 vaccin 	 ate 	 	a	few	children	.
you	 vaccin 	 ate 	 	all	the	children	in	an	area	.
