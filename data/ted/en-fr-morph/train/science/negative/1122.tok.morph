hi	,	my	name	is	marcin	--	 farm 	 er 	 	,	 techno 	 logist 	 	.
i	was	born	in	poland	,	now	in	the	u.s	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	a	group	 call 	 ed 	 	open	source	 eco 	 logy 	 	.	we	've	identified	the	50	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	that	we	think	it	 take 	 s 	 	for	modern	life	to	exist	--	 thing 	 s 	 	from	 tract 	 ors 	 	,	bread	 oven 	 s 	 	,	circuit	makers	.
then	we	set	out	to	create	an	open	source	,	diy	,	do	it	 your 	 self 	 	version	that	 any 	 one 	 	can	build	and	maintain	at	a	fraction	of	the	cost	.
we	call	 th 	 is 	 	the	global	village	construction	set	.
so	let	me	tell	you	a	story	.
so	i	 finish 	 ed 	 	my	20s	with	a	ph.d.	in	fusion	energy	,	and	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	i	was	 use 	 less 	 	.
i	had	no	practical	 skill 	 s 	 	.
the	world	 present 	 ed 	 	me	with	 option 	 s 	 	,	and	i	took	them	.
i	guess	you	can	call	it	the	consumer	 life 	 style 	 	.
so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	a	farm	in	missouri	and	 learn 	 ed 	 	about	the	 economic 	 s 	 	of	 farm 	 ing 	 	.
i	 b 	 ought 	 	a	 tract 	 or 	 	--	then	it	broke	.
i	paid	to	get	it	 repair 	 ed 	 	--	then	it	broke	 aga 	 in 	 	.
then	 pre 	 tty 	 	soon	,	i	was	broke	too	.
i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	the	 tru 	 ly 	 	appropriate	,	low	-	cost	 tool 	 s 	 	that	i	 need 	 ed 	 	to	start	a	 sustain 	 able 	 	farm	and	 settle 	 ment 	 	just	did	n't	exist	yet	.
i	 need 	 ed 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 ro 	 bust 	 	,	modular	,	 high 	 ly 	 	efficient	and	 optimize 	 d 	 	,	low	-	cost	,	made	from	local	and	 recycl 	 ed 	 	 material 	 s 	 	that	would	last	a	 life 	 time 	 	,	not	designed	for	 obsolesc 	 ence 	 	.
i	found	that	i	would	have	to	build	them	 my 	 self 	 	.
so	i	did	just	that	.
and	i	tested	them	.
and	i	found	that	industrial	 product 	 ivity 	 	can	be	 achiev 	 ed 	 	on	a	small	scale	.
so	then	i	 publish 	 ed 	 	the	3d	 design 	 s 	 	,	 schematic 	 s 	 	,	 instruct 	 ional 	 	 video 	 s 	 	and	 budget 	 s 	 	on	a	wiki	.
then	 contributor 	 s 	 	from	all	over	the	world	 beg 	 an 	 	 show 	 ing 	 	up	,	 proto 	 ty 	 ping 	 	new	 machine 	 s 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	 dedicate 	 d 	 	project	 visit 	 s 	 	.
so	far	,	we	have	 prototype 	 d 	 	eight	of	the	50	 machine 	 s 	 	.
and	now	the	project	is	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	grow	on	 it 	 s 	 	own	.
we	know	that	open	source	 ha 	 s 	 	 succeed 	 ed 	 	with	 tool 	 s 	 	for	 man 	 aging 	 	knowledge	and	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	.
and	the	same	is	 start 	 ing 	 	to	happen	with	 hard 	 ware 	 	too	.
we	're	 focus 	 ing 	 	on	 hard 	 ware 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	 hard 	 ware 	 	that	can	change	people	's	 live 	 s 	 	in	 s 	 uch 	 	tangible	material	ways	.
if	we	can	lower	the	 bar 	 rier 	 s 	 	to	 farm 	 ing 	 	,	building	,	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	,	then	we	can	unleash	just	massive	 amount 	 s 	 	of	human	potential	.
that	's	not	 on 	 ly 	 	in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	.
our	 tool 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	made	for	the	american	 farm 	 er 	 	,	 build 	 er 	 	,	entrepreneur	,	maker	.
we	've	 s 	 een 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 excit 	 ement 	 	from	these	people	,	who	can	now	start	a	construction	business	,	 part 	 s 	 	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	,	 organ 	 ic 	 	csa	or	just	selling	power	back	to	the	grid	.
our	goal	is	a	 re 	 posit 	 ory 	 	of	 publish 	 ed 	 	 design 	 s 	 	so	clear	,	so	complete	,	that	a	single	 burn 	 ed 	 	dvd	is	 effective 	 ly 	 	a	 civil 	 ization 	 	 start 	 er 	 	kit	.
i	've	 plant 	 ed 	 	a	hundred	 tree 	 s 	 	in	a	day	.
i	've	 press 	 ed 	 	5,000	 brick 	 s 	 	in	one	day	from	the	dirt	 be 	 neath 	 	my	feet	and	built	a	 tract 	 or 	 	in	six	 day 	 s 	 	.
from	what	i	've	 s 	 een 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 on 	 ly 	 	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
if	 th 	 is 	 	idea	is	 tru 	 ly 	 	sound	,	then	the	 implic 	 ations 	 	are	significant	.
a	 great 	 er 	 	 distribut 	 ion 	 	of	the	 mean 	 s 	 	of	production	,	 environment 	 ally 	 	sound	supply	 chain 	 s 	 	,	and	a	 new 	 ly 	 	relevant	diy	maker	culture	can	hope	to	transcend	artificial	 scar 	 city 	 	.
we	're	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	the	 limit 	 s 	 	of	what	we	all	can	do	to	make	a	better	world	with	open	 hard 	 ware 	 	technology	.
thank	you	.
