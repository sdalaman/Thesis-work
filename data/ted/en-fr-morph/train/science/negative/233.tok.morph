thank	you	so	much	 every 	 one 	 	from	ted	,	and	chris	and	amy	in	 part 	 icular 	 	.
i	can	not	 believ 	 e 	 	i	'm	here	.
i	have	not	slept	in	 week 	 s 	 	.
neil	and	i	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	 compar 	 ing 	 	how	little	we	've	slept	in	 anticip 	 ation 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	.	i	've	never	 be 	 en 	 	so	nervous	--	and	i	do	 th 	 is 	 	when	i	'm	nervous	,	i	just	 real 	 ized 	 	.
so	,	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	sort	of	what	we	did	at	 th 	 is 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	826	valencia	,	and	then	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	how	we	all	might	join	in	and	do	similar	 thing 	 s 	 	.
back	in	about	2000	,	i	was	living	in	brooklyn	,	i	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	finish	my	first	book	,	i	was	 wander 	 ing 	 	around	dazed	every	day	 be 	 cause 	 	i	wrote	from	12	 a.m 	 . 	 	to	5	a.m	.
so	i	would	walk	around	in	a	 da 	 ze 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	day	.
i	had	no	mental	 acu 	 ity 	 	to	speak	of	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	day	,	but	i	had	 flex 	 ible 	 	 hour 	 s 	 	.
in	the	brooklyn	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	that	i	lived	in	,	park	 slop 	 e 	 	,	there	are	a	lot	of	 writer 	 s 	 	--	it	's	like	a	 ver 	 y 	 	high	per	capita	ratio	of	 writer 	 s 	 	to	normal	people	.
 mean 	 while 	 	,	i	had	grown	up	around	a	lot	of	 teacher 	 s 	 	.
my	mom	was	a	teacher	,	my	sister	 be 	 came 	 	a	teacher	and	after	college	so	 man 	 y 	 	of	my	 friend 	 s 	 	went	 in 	 to 	 	 teach 	 ing 	 	.
and	so	i	was	 al 	 ways 	 	 hear 	 ing 	 	them	talk	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	and	how	inspiring	they	 we 	 re 	 	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	sort	of	the	most	hard	-	 work 	 ing 	 	and	 constant 	 ly 	 	inspiring	people	i	 k 	 new 	 	.
but	i	 k 	 new 	 	so	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	up	against	,	so	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 struggle 	 s 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	.
and	one	of	them	was	that	so	 man 	 y 	 	of	my	 friend 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 teach 	 ing 	 	in	city	 school 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	trouble	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 student 	 s 	 	 keep 	 ing 	 	up	at	grade	level	,	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 read 	 ing 	 	and	writing	in	 part 	 icular 	 	.
now	,	so	 man 	 y 	 	of	these	 student 	 s 	 	had	come	from	 house 	 hold 	 s 	 	where	english	is	n't	spoken	in	the	home	,	where	a	lot	of	them	have	different	special	 need 	 s 	 	,	 learn 	 ing 	 	 dis 	 abilities 	 	.	and	of	course	they	're	 work 	 ing 	 	in	 school 	 s 	 	which	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	and	 ver 	 y 	 	often	are	under	-	funded	.
and	so	they	would	talk	to	me	about	 th 	 is 	 	and	say	,	``	you	know	,	what	we	 re 	 ally 	 	need	is	just	more	people	,	more	bodies	,	more	one	-	on	-	one	attention	,	more	 hour 	 s 	 	,	more	 expert 	 ise 	 	from	people	that	have	 skill 	 s 	 	in	english	and	can	work	with	these	 student 	 s 	 	one	-	on	-	one	.	``
now	,	i	would	say	,	``	well	,	why	do	n't	you	just	work	with	them	one	-	on	-	one	?	``
and	they	would	say	,	``	well	,	we	have	five	 class 	 es 	 	of	30	to	40	 student 	 s 	 	each	.
 th 	 is 	 	can	lead	up	to	150	,	180	,	200	 student 	 s 	 	a	day	.
how	can	we	possibly	give	each	student	even	one	hour	a	week	of	one	-	on	-	one	attention	?	``
you	'd	have	to	 great 	 ly 	 	 multi 	 ply 	 	the	 work 	 week 	 	and	clone	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	.
and	so	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	at	the	same	time	,	i	thought	about	 th 	 is 	 	massive	group	of	people	i	 k 	 new 	 	:	 writer 	 s 	 	,	 editor 	 s 	 	,	 journalist 	 s 	 	,	graduate	 student 	 s 	 	,	 assist 	 ant 	 	 professor 	 s 	 	,	you	name	it	.
all	these	people	that	had	sort	of	 flex 	 ible 	 	 dai 	 ly 	 	 hour 	 s 	 	and	an	interest	in	the	english	word	--	i	hope	to	have	an	interest	in	the	english	language	,	but	i	'm	not	 s 	 peaking 	 	it	well	right	now	.
i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	.	that	clock	 ha 	 s 	 	got	me	.
but	 every 	 one 	 	that	i	 k 	 new 	 	had	an	interest	in	the	 prim 	 acy 	 	of	the	written	word	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 nurtur 	 ing 	 	a	 demo 	 cracy 	 	,	 nurtur 	 ing 	 	an	 enlighten 	 ed 	 	life	.
and	so	they	had	,	you	know	,	 the 	 ir 	 	time	and	 the 	 ir 	 	interest	,	but	at	the	same	time	there	was	n't	a	conduit	that	i	 k 	 new 	 	of	in	my	community	to	 br 	 ing 	 	these	two	 commun 	 ities 	 	together	.
so	when	i	 move 	 d 	 	back	to	san	francisco	,	we	 rent 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	building	.
and	the	idea	was	to	put	mcsweeney	's	--	mcsweeney	's	 quarter 	 ly 	 	,	that	we	 publish 	 ed 	 	twice	or	three	 time 	 s 	 	a	year	,	and	a	few	other	 magazine 	 s 	 	--	we	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	move	it	 in 	 to 	 	an	 off 	 ice 	 	for	the	first	time	.
it	used	to	be	in	my	kitchen	in	brooklyn	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	move	it	 in 	 to 	 	an	 off 	 ice 	 	,	and	we	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	share	space	with	a	 tutor 	 ing 	 	center	.
so	we	thought	,	``	we	'll	have	all	these	 writer 	 s 	 	and	 editor 	 s 	 	and	 every 	 body 	 	--	sort	of	a	writing	community	--	coming	 in 	 to 	 	the	 off 	 ice 	 	every	day	 any 	 way 	 	,	why	do	n't	we	just	open	up	the	front	of	the	building	for	 student 	 s 	 	to	come	in	there	after	school	,	get	extra	help	on	 the 	 ir 	 	written	 home 	 work 	 	,	so	you	have	 bas 	 ically 	 	no	border	between	these	two	 commun 	 ities 	 	?	``
so	the	idea	was	that	we	would	be	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 what 	 ever 	 	we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	on	,	at	2:30	 p.m 	 . 	 	the	 student 	 s 	 	flow	in	and	you	put	down	what	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	,	or	you	trade	,	or	you	work	a	little	bit	 lat 	 er 	 	or	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	.
you	give	 t 	 hose 	 	 hour 	 s 	 	in	the	afternoon	to	the	 student 	 s 	 	in	the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	.
so	,	we	had	 th 	 is 	 	place	,	we	 rent 	 ed 	 	it	,	the	 land 	 lord 	 	was	all	for	it	.	we	did	 th 	 is 	 	mural	,	that	's	a	chris	ware	mural	,	that	 bas 	 ically 	 	 explain 	 s 	 	the	entire	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	the	 print 	 ed 	 	word	,	in	mural	form	--	it	 take 	 s 	 	a	long	time	to	digest	and	you	have	to	stand	in	the	middle	of	the	road	.
so	we	 rent 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	space	.	and	 every 	 thing 	 	was	great	 ex 	 cept 	 	the	 land 	 lord 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	the	space	is	zoned	for	 re 	 tail 	 	;	you	have	to	come	up	with	 some 	 thing 	 	.
you	've	got	ta	sell	 some 	 thing 	 	.
you	ca	n't	just	have	a	 tutor 	 ing 	 	center	.	``
so	we	thought	,	``	ha	ha	!	 re 	 ally 	 	!	``
and	we	could	n't	think	of	 any 	 thing 	 	 necess 	 arily 	 	to	sell	,	but	we	did	all	the	 necess 	 ary 	 	research	.
it	used	to	be	a	weight	room	,	so	there	 we 	 re 	 	rubber	 floor 	 s 	 	 be 	 low 	 	,	acoustic	tile	 ceil 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	fluorescent	 light 	 s 	 	.
we	took	all	that	down	,	and	we	found	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 wood 	 en 	 	 floor 	 s 	 	,	whitewashed	 beam 	 s 	 	and	it	had	the	look	--	while	we	 we 	 re 	 	renovating	 th 	 is 	 	place	,	 some 	 body 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	,	it	 re 	 ally 	 	kind	of	 look 	 s 	 	like	the	hull	of	a	ship	.	``
and	we	 look 	 ed 	 	around	and	 some 	 body 	 	else	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	you	should	sell	 suppli 	 es 	 	to	the	 work 	 ing 	 	buccaneer	.	``
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	did	.	so	it	made	 every 	 body 	 	laugh	,	and	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	there	's	a	point	to	that	.
let	's	sell	pirate	 suppli 	 es 	 	.	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	pirate	supply	store	.
you	see	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	sort	of	a	sketch	i	did	on	a	napkin	.
a	great	 carp 	 enter 	 	built	all	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	and	you	see	,	we	made	it	look	sort	of	pirate	supply	-	like	.
here	you	see	 plank 	 s 	 	 s 	 old 	 	by	the	foot	and	we	have	 suppli 	 es 	 	to	combat	 s 	 curv 	 y 	 	.	we	have	the	peg	 leg 	 s 	 	there	,	that	are	all	 hand 	 made 	 	and	fitted	to	you	.	up	at	the	top	,	you	see	the	eyepatch	 dis 	 play 	 	,	which	is	the	black	column	there	for	 every 	 day 	 	use	for	your	eyepatch	,	and	then	you	have	the	pastel	and	other	 color 	 s 	 	for	 step 	 ping 	 	out	at	night	--	special	 occasion 	 s 	 	,	bar	mitzvahs	and	 what 	 ever 	 	.
so	we	 open 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	place	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	vat	that	we	fill	with	 treasu 	 re 	 s 	 	that	 student 	 s 	 	dig	in	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 placement 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	in	case	you	lose	one	.	these	are	some	 sign 	 s 	 	that	we	have	all	over	the	place	:	``	practical	 jok 	 ing 	 	with	 pirate 	 s 	 	.	``
while	you	're	 read 	 ing 	 	the	sign	,	we	pull	a	rope	 be 	 hind 	 	the	counter	and	eight	mop	 head 	 s 	 	drop	on	your	head	.
that	was	just	my	one	thing	--	i	 s 	 aid 	 	we	had	to	have	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 drop 	 s 	 	on	people	's	 head 	 s 	 	.
it	 be 	 came 	 	mop	 head 	 s 	 	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	fish	theater	,	which	is	just	a	 salt 	 water 	 	tank	with	three	 seat 	 s 	 	,	and	then	right	 be 	 hind 	 	it	we	set	up	 th 	 is 	 	space	,	which	was	the	 tutor 	 ing 	 	center	.
so	right	there	is	the	 tutor 	 ing 	 	center	,	and	then	 be 	 hind 	 	the	 cur 	 tain 	 	 we 	 re 	 	the	mcsweeney	's	 off 	 ice 	 s 	 	,	where	all	of	us	would	be	 work 	 ing 	 	on	the	magazine	and	book	 edit 	 ing 	 	and	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	.
the	 kid 	 s 	 	would	come	in	--	or	we	thought	they	would	come	in	.	i	should	back	up	.
we	set	the	place	up	,	we	 open 	 ed 	 	up	,	we	 s 	 pent 	 	 month 	 s 	 	and	 month 	 s 	 	renovating	 th 	 is 	 	place	.
we	had	 table 	 s 	 	,	 chair 	 s 	 	,	 computer 	 s 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	.
i	went	to	a	dot	-	com	auction	at	a	 holi 	 day 	 	 in 	 n 	 	in	palo	 al 	 to 	 	and	i	 b 	 ought 	 	11	g	4s	with	a	stroke	of	a	 padd 	 le 	 	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	we	 b 	 ought 	 	'	em	,	we	set	 every 	 thing 	 	up	and	then	we	 wait 	 ed 	 	.
it	was	 start 	 ed 	 	with	about	12	of	my	 friend 	 s 	 	,	people	that	i	had	known	for	 year 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 writer 	 s 	 	in	the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	.
and	we	 s 	 at 	 	.	and	at	2:30	 p.m 	 . 	 	we	put	a	sandwich	board	out	on	the	front	 side 	 walk 	 	and	it	just	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	free	 tutor 	 ing 	 	for	your	english	-	related	and	writing	-	related	 need 	 s 	 	--	just	come	in	,	it	's	all	free	.	``
and	we	thought	,	``	oh	,	they	're	going	to	storm	the	 gate 	 s 	 	,	they	're	gon	na	love	it	.	``	and	they	did	n't	.
and	so	we	 wait 	 ed 	 	,	we	 s 	 at 	 	at	the	 table 	 s 	 	,	we	 wait 	 ed 	 	and	 wait 	 ed 	 	.
and	 every 	 body 	 	was	 be 	 coming 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 dis 	 courage 	 d 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	 week 	 s 	 	and	 week 	 s 	 	that	we	 wait 	 ed 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	where	 no 	 body 	 	came	in	.
and	then	 some 	 body 	 	alerted	us	to	the	fact	that	 may 	 be 	 	there	was	a	trust	gap	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	 oper 	 ating 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	a	pirate	supply	store	.
we	never	put	it	together	,	you	know	?
and	so	then	,	around	that	time	,	i	 persuad 	 ed 	 	a	woman	named	nineveh	caligari	,	a	 long 	 time 	 	san	francisco	 educ 	 ator 	 	--	she	was	 teach 	 ing 	 	in	mexico	city	,	she	had	all	the	experience	 necess 	 ary 	 	,	 k 	 new 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	about	education	,	was	 connect 	 ed 	 	with	all	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	and	community	 member 	 s 	 	in	the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	--
i	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	her	to	move	up	from	mexico	city	where	she	was	 teach 	 ing 	 	.	she	took	over	 a 	 s 	 	 ex 	 ecutive 	 	director	.
 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	,	she	made	the	inroads	with	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	and	the	 parent 	 s 	 	and	the	 student 	 s 	 	and	 every 	 thing 	 	,	and	so	 sudden 	 ly 	 	it	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	full	every	day	.
and	what	we	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 off 	 er 	 	every	day	was	one	-	on	-	one	attention	.
the	goal	was	to	have	a	one	-	to	-	one	ratio	with	every	one	of	these	 student 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	proven	that	35	to	40	 hour 	 s 	 	a	year	with	one	-	on	-	one	attention	,	a	student	can	get	one	grade	level	 high 	 er 	 	.
and	so	most	of	these	 student 	 s 	 	,	english	is	not	spoken	in	the	home	.
they	come	there	,	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	--	you	ca	n't	see	it	,	but	there	's	a	church	pew	that	i	 b 	 ought 	 	in	a	berkeley	auction	right	there	--	the	 parent 	 s 	 	will	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	watch	while	 the 	 ir 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 tutor 	 ed 	 	.
so	that	was	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	it	,	was	one	-	on	-	one	attention	.
and	we	found	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	full	every	day	with	 kid 	 s 	 	.
if	you	're	on	valencia	street	 with 	 in 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	few	 block 	 s 	 	at	around	2	 p.m 	 . 	 	,	2:30	 p.m 	 . 	 	,	you	will	get	run	over	,	often	,	by	the	 kid 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	big	 back 	 pack 	 s 	 	,	or	 what 	 ever 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	running	to	 th 	 is 	 	space	,
which	is	 ver 	 y 	 	strange	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	school	,	in	a	way	.
but	there	was	 some 	 thing 	 	 psycho 	 logical 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	there	that	was	just	a	little	bit	different	.
and	the	other	thing	was	,	there	was	no	stigma	.
 kid 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	n't	going	 in 	 to 	 	the	``	center	-	for	-	 kid 	 s 	 	-	that	-	need	-	more	-	help	,	``	or	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	.	it	was	826	valencia	.
first	of	all	,	it	was	a	pirate	supply	store	,	which	is	 insan 	 e 	 	.
and	then	 second 	 ly 	 	,	there	's	a	 publish 	 ing 	 	company	in	the	back	.
and	so	our	interns	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	at	the	same	 table 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	often	,	and	shoulder	-	to	-	shoulder	,	computer	-	next	-	to	-	computer	with	the	 student 	 s 	 	.
and	so	it	 be 	 came 	 	a	 tutor 	 ing 	 	center	--	 publish 	 ing 	 	center	,	is	what	we	 call 	 ed 	 	it	--	and	a	writing	center	.
they	go	in	,	and	they	might	be	 work 	 ing 	 	with	a	high	school	student	 actual 	 ly 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	a	novel	--	 be 	 cause 	 	we	had	 ver 	 y 	 	 gift 	 ed 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	,	too	.
so	there	's	no	stigma	.
they	're	all	 work 	 ing 	 	next	to	each	other	.	it	's	all	a	creative	endeavor	.
they	're	 see 	 ing 	 	 adult 	 s 	 	.	they	're	 model 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	behavior	.
these	 adult 	 s 	 	,	they	're	 work 	 ing 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	field	.
they	can	lean	over	,	ask	a	question	of	one	of	these	 adult 	 s 	 	and	it	all	sort	of	 feed 	 s 	 	on	each	other	.
there	's	a	lot	of	cross	-	 pollinat 	 ion 	 	.	the	 on 	 ly 	 	problem	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	for	the	 adult 	 s 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	at	mcsweeney	's	who	had	n't	 necess 	 arily 	 	 b 	 ought 	 	 in 	 to 	 	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	when	they	 sign 	 ed 	 	up	,	was	that	there	was	just	the	one	 bath 	 room 	 	.
with	like	60	 kid 	 s 	 	a	day	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	problem	.
but	you	know	,	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	about	the	 kid 	 s 	 	 finish 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 home 	 work 	 	in	a	 give 	 n 	 	day	,	 work 	 ing 	 	one	-	on	-	one	,	 get 	 ting 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	attention	--	they	go	home	,	they	're	 finish 	 ed 	 	.	they	do	n't	stall	.	they	do	n't	do	 the 	 ir 	 	 home 	 work 	 	in	front	of	the	tv	.
they	're	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	go	home	at	5:30	 p.m 	 . 	 	,	enjoy	 the 	 ir 	 	family	,	enjoy	other	 hob 	 bie 	 s 	 	,	get	 out 	 side 	 	,	play	.
and	that	 make 	 s 	 	a	happy	family	.
a	bunch	of	happy	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	in	a	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	is	a	happy	community	.
a	bunch	of	happy	 commun 	 ities 	 	 ti 	 ed 	 	together	is	a	happy	city	and	a	happy	world	.
so	the	key	to	it	all	is	 home 	 work 	 	!
there	you	have	it	,	you	know	--	one	-	on	-	one	attention	.
so	we	 start 	 ed 	 	off	with	about	12	 volunteer 	 s 	 	,	and	then	we	had	about	50	,
and	then	a	couple	hundred	.
and	we	now	have	1,400	 volunteer 	 s 	 	on	our	roster	.
and	we	make	it	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	easy	to	volunteer	.
the	key	thing	is	,	even	if	you	 on 	 ly 	 	have	a	couple	of	 hour 	 s 	 	a	month	,	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 hour 	 s 	 	shoulder	-	to	-	shoulder	,	next	to	one	student	,	 concent 	 rated 	 	attention	,	 shin 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	beam	of	light	on	 the 	 ir 	 	work	,	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 thought 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	self	-	 express 	 ion 	 	,	is	going	to	be	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 transform 	 ative 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	so	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 student 	 s 	 	have	not	had	that	ever	before	.
so	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	even	if	you	have	two	 hour 	 s 	 	one	sunday	every	six	 month 	 s 	 	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	.	that	's	going	to	be	 en 	 ough 	 	.	``
so	that	's	 part 	 ly 	 	why	the	tutor	 corp 	 s 	 	grew	so	fast	.
then	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	what	are	we	going	to	do	with	the	space	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	day	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	used	before	2:30	 p.m 	 . 	 	?	``
so	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	in	 class 	 es 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	day	.
so	every	day	,	there	's	a	field	trip	where	they	together	create	a	book	--
you	can	see	it	 be 	 ing 	 	 type 	 d 	 	up	above	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	 class 	 es 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	way	too	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	writing	.
you	just	point	a	camera	at	a	class	,	and	it	 al 	 ways 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	 book 	 s 	 	that	they	do	.
notice	the	title	of	the	book	,	``	the	book	that	was	never	 check 	 ed 	 	out	:	 titan 	 ic 	 	.	``
and	the	first	line	of	that	book	is	,	``	once	there	was	a	book	named	cindy	that	was	about	the	 titan 	 ic 	 	.	``
so	,	 mean 	 while 	 	,	there	's	an	adult	in	the	back	 ty 	 ping 	 	 th 	 is 	 	up	,	taking	it	 complete 	 ly 	 	 serious 	 ly 	 	,	which	 blow 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	mind	.
so	then	we	still	had	more	tutors	to	use	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	shot	of	just	some	of	the	tutors	 dur 	 ing 	 	one	of	the	 event 	 s 	 	.
the	 teacher 	 s 	 	that	we	work	with	--	and	 every 	 thing 	 	is	different	to	 teacher 	 s 	 	--	they	tell	us	what	to	do	.
we	went	in	there	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	we	're	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	 complete 	 ly 	 	 malle 	 able 	 	.	you	're	going	to	tell	us	.
the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	's	going	to	tell	us	,	the	 parent 	 s 	 	are	going	to	tell	us	.
the	 teacher 	 s 	 	are	going	to	tell	us	how	we	're	most	 use 	 ful 	 	.	``
so	then	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	why	do	n't	you	come	 in 	 to 	 	the	 school 	 s 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	what	about	the	 student 	 s 	 	that	would	n't	come	to	you	,	 necess 	 arily 	 	,	who	do	n't	have	 re 	 ally 	 	active	 parent 	 s 	 	that	are	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	them	in	,	or	are	n't	close	 en 	 ough 	 	?	``	so	then	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	well	,	we	've	got	1,400	people	on	our	tutor	roster	.
let	's	just	put	out	the	word	.	``	a	teacher	will	say	,	``	i	need	12	tutors	for	the	next	five	sundays	.
we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	on	our	college	 essay 	 s 	 	.	 s 	 end 	 	them	in	.	``
so	we	put	that	out	on	the	wire	:	1,400	tutors	.
 who 	 ever 	 	can	make	it	 sign 	 s 	 	up	.	they	go	in	about	a	half	an	hour	before	the	class	.
the	teacher	 tell 	 s 	 	them	what	to	do	,	how	to	do	it	,	what	 the 	 ir 	 	training	is	,	what	 the 	 ir 	 	project	is	so	far	.
they	work	under	the	teacher	's	guide	,	and	it	's	all	in	one	big	room	.
and	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	 br 	 un 	 t 	 	of	what	we	do	is	,	people	going	straight	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 work 	 place 	 	,	straight	from	home	,	straight	 in 	 to 	 	the	 class 	 room 	 	and	 work 	 ing 	 	 direct 	 ly 	 	with	the	 student 	 s 	 	.
so	then	we	're	able	to	work	with	 thousand 	 s 	 	and	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	more	 student 	 s 	 	.
then	 an 	 other 	 	school	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	what	if	we	just	give	you	a	 class 	 room 	 	and	you	can	staff	it	all	day	?	``
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	everett	middle	school	 writer 	 s 	 	'	room	,	where	we	 decor 	 ated 	 	it	in	buccaneer	style	.
it	's	right	off	the	library	.	and	there	we	serve	all	529	 kid 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	middle	school	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 the 	 ir 	 	 news 	 paper 	 	,	the	``	straight	-	up	news	,	``	that	 ha 	 s 	 	an	 on 	 going 	 	column	from	mayor	gavin	newsom
in	both	 language 	 s 	 	--	english	and	spanish	.
so	then	one	day	isabel	allende	wrote	to	us	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	why	do	n't	you	assign	a	book	with	high	school	 student 	 s 	 	?
i	want	them	to	write	about	how	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	peace	in	a	violent	world	.	``
and	so	we	went	 in 	 to 	 	thurgood	marshall	high	school	,	which	is	a	school	that	we	had	 work 	 ed 	 	with	on	some	other	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	we	 g 	 ave 	 	that	 assign 	 ment 	 	to	the	 student 	 s 	 	.
and	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	isabel	allende	is	going	to	read	all	your	 essay 	 s 	 	at	the	end	.
she	's	going	to	publish	them	in	a	book	.
she	's	going	to	sponsor	the	 print 	 ing 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	book	in	 paper 	 back 	 	form	.
it	's	going	to	be	 avail 	 able 	 	in	all	the	 book 	 store 	 s 	 	in	the	 ba 	 y 	 	area	and	 through 	 out 	 	the	world	,	on	amazon	and	you	name	it	.	``
so	these	 kid 	 s 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	 hard 	 er 	 	than	they	've	ever	 work 	 ed 	 	on	 any 	 thing 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	was	that	 out 	 side 	 	audience	,	there	was	isabel	allende	on	the	other	end	.
i	think	we	had	about	170	tutors	that	 work 	 ed 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	book	with	them	and	so	 th 	 is 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	out	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	well	.
we	had	a	big	party	at	the	end	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	book	that	you	can	find	 any 	 where 	 	.	so	that	led	to	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	these	.
you	can	see	amy	tan	 sponsor 	 ed 	 	the	next	one	,	``	i	might	get	 some 	 where 	 	.	``
and	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 came 	 	an	 on 	 going 	 	thing	.	more	and	more	 book 	 s 	 	.
now	we	're	sort	of	 addict 	 ed 	 	to	the	book	thing	.
the	 kid 	 s 	 	will	work	 hard 	 er 	 	than	they	've	ever	 work 	 ed 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	life	if	they	know	it	's	going	to	be	permanent	,	know	it	's	going	to	be	on	a	shelf	,	know	that	 no 	 body 	 	can	diminish	what	they	've	thought	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	that	we	've	 honor 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 word 	 s 	 	,	 honor 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 thought 	 s 	 	with	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 hour 	 s 	 	of	five	 draft 	 s 	 	,	six	 draft 	 s 	 	--	all	 th 	 is 	 	attention	that	we	give	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 thought 	 s 	 	.
and	once	they	 achiev 	 e 	 	that	level	,	once	they	've	written	at	that	level	,	they	can	never	go	back	.
it	's	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 transform 	 ative 	 	.
and	so	then	they	're	all	 s 	 old 	 	in	the	store	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	near	the	 plank 	 s 	 	.
we	sell	all	the	student	 book 	 s 	 	.
where	else	would	you	put	them	,	right	?
so	we	sell	'	em	,	and	then	 some 	 thing 	 	weird	had	 be 	 en 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	with	the	 store 	 s 	 	.	the	store	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	even	 th 	 ough 	 	we	 start 	 ed 	 	out	 a 	 s 	 	just	a	 ga 	 g 	 	--	the	store	 actual 	 ly 	 	made	money	.
so	it	was	 pay 	 ing 	 	the	rent	.
and	 may 	 be 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	a	san	francisco	thing	--	i	do	n't	know	,	i	do	n't	want	to	 judg 	 e 	 	.
but	people	would	come	in	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	was	before	the	pirate	 movie 	 s 	 	and	 every 	 thing 	 	!
it	was	making	a	lot	of	money	.	not	a	lot	of	money	,	but	it	was	 pay 	 ing 	 	the	rent	,	 pay 	 ing 	 	a	full	-	time	staff	member	there	.
there	's	the	ocean	 map 	 s 	 	you	can	see	on	the	left	.
and	it	 be 	 came 	 	a	 gate 	 way 	 	to	the	community	.	people	would	come	in	and	say	,	``	what	the	-	-	?
what	is	 th 	 is 	 	?	``	i	do	n't	want	to	 s 	 wear 	 	on	the	web	.
is	that	a	rule	?	i	do	n't	know	.
they	would	say	,	``	what	is	 th 	 is 	 	?	``
and	people	would	come	in	and	learn	more	about	it	.
and	then	right	beyond	--	there	's	 usual 	 ly 	 	a	little	chain	there	--	right	beyond	,	they	would	see	the	 kid 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 tutor 	 ed 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	field	trip	going	on	.	and	so	they	would	be	 shop 	 ping 	 	,	and	they	might	be	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	buy	some	lard	,	or	millet	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 par 	 rot 	 	,	or	,	you	know	,	a	hook	,	or	hook	 protect 	 or 	 	for	 night 	 time 	 	,	all	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	we	sell	.
so	the	store	 actual 	 ly 	 	did	 re 	 ally 	 	well	.
but	it	 br 	 ought 	 	in	so	 man 	 y 	 	people	--	 teacher 	 s 	 	,	 donor 	 s 	 	,	 volunteer 	 s 	 	,	 every 	 body 	 	--
 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	street	level	.	it	was	open	to	the	public	.
it	was	n't	a	non	-	profit	buried	,	you	know	,	on	the	30th	floor	of	some	building	 down 	 town 	 	.	it	was	right	in	the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	that	it	was	 serv 	 ing 	 	,	and	it	was	open	all	the	time	to	the	public	.
so	,	it	 be 	 came 	 	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	weird	,	happy	accident	.
so	all	the	people	i	used	to	know	in	brooklyn	,	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	why	do	n't	we	have	a	place	like	that	here	?	``
and	a	lot	of	them	had	 be 	 en 	 	 form 	 er 	 	 educ 	 ators 	 	or	would	-	be	 educ 	 ators 	 	,	so	they	 combine 	 d 	 	with	a	lot	of	local	 design 	 ers 	 	,	local	 writer 	 s 	 	,	and	they	just	took	the	idea	 in 	 dependent 	 ly 	 	and	they	did	 the 	 ir 	 	own	thing	.
they	did	n't	want	to	sell	pirate	 suppli 	 es 	 	.	they	did	n't	think	that	that	was	going	to	work	there	.
so	,	 know 	 ing 	 	the	crime	-	 fight 	 ing 	 	community	in	new	york	,	they	 open 	 ed 	 	the	brooklyn	 super 	 hero 	 	supply	company	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	sam	potts	'	great	design	that	did	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	to	make	it	look	sort	of	like	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	keysmith	's	 shop 	 s 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	to	have	every	service	they	've	ever	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	,	you	know	,	all	over	there	.
so	they	 open 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	place	.	 in 	 side 	 	,	it	's	like	a	costco	for	 super 	 heroes 	 	--	all	the	 suppli 	 es 	 	in	kind	of	 bas 	 ic 	 	form	.
these	are	all	 hand 	 made 	 	.
these	are	all	sort	of	repurposed	other	 product 	 s 	 	,	or	 what 	 ever 	 	.
all	the	 pack 	 aging 	 	is	 d 	 one 	 	by	sam	potts	.
so	then	you	have	the	 villa 	 in 	 	 contain 	 ment 	 	unit	,	where	 kid 	 s 	 	put	 the 	 ir 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	.	you	have	the	 off 	 ice 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	little	vault	--	you	have	to	put	your	product	in	there	,	it	 go 	 es 	 	up	an	electric	lift	and	then	the	guy	 be 	 hind 	 	the	counter	 tell 	 s 	 	you	that	you	have	to	 re 	 cite 	 	the	vow	of	 hero 	 ism 	 	,	which	you	do	,	if	you	want	to	buy	 any 	 thing 	 	.	and	it	 limit 	 s 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 sale 	 s 	 	.
 personal 	 ly 	 	,	i	think	it	's	a	problem	.
 be 	 cause 	 	they	have	to	do	it	hand	on	heart	and	 every 	 thing 	 	.
these	are	some	of	the	 product 	 s 	 	.	these	are	all	 hand 	 made 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	secret	 ident 	 ity 	 	kit	.
if	you	want	to	take	on	the	 ident 	 ity 	 	of	sharon	boone	,	one	american	female	 market 	 ing 	 	 ex 	 ecutive 	 	from	hoboken	,	new	jersey	.	it	's	a	full	dossier	on	 every 	 thing 	 	you	would	need	to	know	about	sharon	boone	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	capery	where	you	get	fitted	for	your	cape	,	and	then	you	walk	up	these	three	steel	-	 grad 	 ed 	 	 step 	 s 	 	and	then	we	turn	on	three	 hyd 	 raulic 	 	 fan 	 s 	 	from	every	side	and	then	you	can	see	the	cape	in	action	.
there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	 wo 	 rse 	 	than	,	you	know	,	 get 	 ting 	 	up	there	and	the	cape	is	 bunch 	 ing 	 	up	or	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
so	then	,	the	secret	door	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	 shelv 	 es 	 	you	do	n't	see	when	you	walk	in	,	but	it	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	 open 	 s 	 	.
you	can	see	it	there	in	the	middle	next	to	all	the	 grappl 	 ing 	 	 hook 	 s 	 	.
it	 open 	 s 	 	and	then	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 tutor 	 ing 	 	center	in	the	back	.
so	you	can	see	the	full	effect	!
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	--	i	just	want	to	 emphas 	 ize 	 	--	 local 	 ly 	 	funded	,	 local 	 ly 	 	built	.
all	the	 design 	 ers 	 	,	all	of	the	 build 	 ers 	 	,	 every 	 body 	 	was	local	,	all	the	time	was	pro	-	bono	.
i	just	came	and	 visit 	 ed 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	you	 guy 	 s 	 	are	 do 	 ing 	 	great	,	``	or	 what 	 ever 	 	.	that	was	it	.	you	can	see	the	time	in	all	five	 bo 	 rough 	 s 	 	of	new	york	in	the	back	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	space	 dur 	 ing 	 	 tutor 	 ing 	 	 hour 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 bus 	 y 	 	.	same	 principle 	 s 	 	:	one	-	on	-	one	attention	,	complete	devotion	to	the	 student 	 s 	 	'	work	and	a	 bound 	 less 	 	 optim 	 ism 	 	and	sort	of	a	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	and	 idea 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 witch 	 	is	 flick 	 ed 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 head 	 s 	 	when	they	walk	through	 t 	 hose 	 	18	feet	of	 th 	 is 	 	bizarre	store	,	right	?
so	it	's	school	,	but	it	's	not	school	.
it	's	 clear 	 ly 	 	not	school	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	they	're	 work 	 ing 	 	shoulder	-	to	-	shoulder	on	 table 	 s 	 	,	 pencil 	 s 	 	and	 paper 	 s 	 	,	 what 	 ever 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	 student 	 s 	 	,	khaled	hamdan	.
you	can	read	 th 	 is 	 	quote	.
 addict 	 ed 	 	to	video	 game 	 s 	 	and	tv	.	could	n't	 concent 	 rate 	 	at	home	.
came	in	.	got	 th 	 is 	 	 concent 	 rated 	 	attention	.
and	he	could	n't	 es 	 cape 	 	it	.
so	,	soon	 en 	 ough 	 	,	he	was	writing	.	he	would	finish	his	 home 	 work 	 	early	--	got	 re 	 ally 	 	 addict 	 ed 	 	to	 finish 	 ing 	 	his	 home 	 work 	 	early	.
it	's	an	 addict 	 ive 	 	thing	to	sort	of	be	 d 	 one 	 	with	it	,	and	to	have	it	 check 	 ed 	 	,	and	to	know	he	's	going	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	the	next	thing	and	be	prepared	for	school	the	next	day	.
so	he	got	 hook 	 ed 	 	on	that	,	and	then	he	 start 	 ed 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	other	 thing 	 s 	 	.
he	's	now	 be 	 en 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	in	five	 book 	 s 	 	.
he	co	-	wrote	a	mockumentary	about	 fail 	 ed 	 	 super 	 heroes 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	``	super	-	 ha 	 s 	 	-	beens	.	``
he	wrote	a	 s 	 eries 	 	on	``	penguin	balboa	,	``	which	is	a	 fight 	 ing 	 	--	a	 box 	 ing 	 	--	penguin	.
and	then	he	read	 a 	 loud 	 	just	a	few	 week 	 s 	 	ago	to	500	people	at	 sym 	 phony 	 	space	,	at	a	benefit	for	826	new	york	.	so	he	's	there	every	day	.
he	's	 evangel 	 ical 	 	about	it	.	he	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	his	 cousin 	 s 	 	in	now	.
there	's	four	family	 member 	 s 	 	that	come	in	every	day	.
so	,	i	'll	go	through	 re 	 ally 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	l.a.	,	the	echo	park	time	travel	mart	:	``	 when 	 ever 	 	you	are	,	we	're	 al 	 ready 	 	then	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	sort	of	a	7	-	eleven	for	time	 travel 	 ers 	 	.
so	you	see	 every 	 thing 	 	:	it	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	7	-	eleven	would	be	.
 lee 	 ches 	 	.	 mamm 	 oth 	 	 chunk 	 s 	 	.	they	even	have	 the 	 ir 	 	own	slurpee	machine	:	``	out	of	order	.	come	back	 yester 	 day 	 	.	``
 any 	 way 	 	.	so	i	'm	going	to	jump	 a 	 head 	 	.
these	are	 space 	 s 	 	that	are	 on 	 ly 	 	affiliated	with	us	,	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	same	thing	:	word	st.	in	pittsfield	,	massachusetts	;
