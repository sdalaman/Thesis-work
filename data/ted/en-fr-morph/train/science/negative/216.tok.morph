i	'm	here	to	enlist	you	in	 help 	 ing 	 	 re 	 shape 	 	the	story	about	how	 human 	 s 	 	and	other	 critter 	 s 	 	get	 thing 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	.	here	is	the	old	story	--	we	've	 al 	 ready 	 	heard	a	little	bit	about	it	:
biology	is	war	in	which	 on 	 ly 	 	the	 fierce 	 st 	 	 surviv 	 e 	 	;
 business 	 es 	 	and	 nation 	 s 	 	succeed	 on 	 ly 	 	by	 defeat 	 ing 	 	,	 destroy 	 ing 	 	and	 domin 	 ating 	 	 com 	 petition 	 	;
 politic 	 s 	 	is	about	your	side	winning	at	all	 cost 	 s 	 	.
but	i	think	we	can	see	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 begin 	 ning 	 s 	 	of	a	new	story	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	emerge	.
it	's	a	narrative	spread	 a 	 cross 	 	a	number	of	different	 discipline 	 s 	 	,	in	which	 co 	 operation 	 	,	 collect 	 ive 	 	action	and	complex	 inter 	 depend 	 encies 	 	play	a	more	 import 	 ant 	 	role	.
and	the	central	,	but	not	all	-	 import 	 ant 	 	,	role	of	 com 	 petition 	 	and	 surviv 	 al 	 	of	the	 fit 	 test 	 	 shrink 	 s 	 	just	a	little	bit	to	make	room	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	relationship	between	communication	,	media	and	 collect 	 ive 	 	action	when	i	wrote	``	smart	 mob 	 s 	 	,	``	and	i	found	that	when	i	 finish 	 ed 	 	the	book	,	i	 ke 	 pt 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	it	.
in	fact	,	if	you	look	back	,	human	communication	media	and	the	ways	in	which	we	organize	 social 	 ly 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	co	-	 evolv 	 ing 	 	for	 quit 	 e 	 	a	long	time	.
 human 	 s 	 	have	lived	for	much	,	much	 long 	 er 	 	than	the	 approximate 	 ly 	 	10,000	 year 	 s 	 	of	 settl 	 ed 	 	 agricultur 	 al 	 	 civil 	 ization 	 
in	small	family	 group 	 s 	 	.	 nomad 	 ic 	 	 hunter 	 s 	 	 br 	 ing 	 	down	 rabbi 	 ts 	 	,	 gather 	 ing 	 	food	.
the	form	of	wealth	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 day 	 s 	 	was	 en 	 ough 	 	food	to	stay	 al 	 ive 	 	.
but	at	some	point	,	they	 band 	 ed 	 	together	to	hunt	 big 	 ger 	 	game	.
and	we	do	n't	know	 exact 	 ly 	 	how	they	did	 th 	 is 	 	,
 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	they	must	have	 solve 	 d 	 	some	 collect 	 ive 	 	action	 problem 	 s 	 	;
it	 on 	 ly 	 	 make 	 s 	 	sense	that	you	ca	n't	hunt	 mast 	 odon 	 s 	 	while	you	're	 fight 	 ing 	 	with	the	other	 group 	 s 	 	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	we	have	no	way	of	 know 	 ing 	 	,	but	it	's	clear	that	a	new	form	of	wealth	must	have	 emerge 	 d 	 	.
more	protein	than	a	hunter	's	family	could	eat	before	it	 rot 	 ted 	 	.
so	that	raised	a	social	question	that	i	 believ 	 e 	 	must	have	driven	new	social	 form 	 s 	 	.
did	the	people	who	ate	that	 mast 	 odon 	 	meat	owe	 some 	 thing 	 	to	the	 hunter 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	?
and	if	so	,	how	did	they	make	 arrange 	 ments 	 	?
 aga 	 in 	 	,	we	ca	n't	know	,	but	we	can	be	 pre 	 tty 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	that	some	form	of	 symbol 	 ic 	 	communication	must	have	 be 	 en 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	.
of	course	,	with	 agricultur 	 e 	 	came	the	first	big	 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	,	the	first	cities	built	of	mud	and	brick	,	the	first	 empire 	 s 	 	.
and	it	was	the	 administer 	 s 	 	of	these	 empire 	 s 	 	who	 beg 	 an 	 	 hir 	 ing 	 	people	to	keep	track	of	the	wheat	and	sheep	and	wine	that	was	 ow 	 ed 	 	and	the	 tax 	 es 	 	that	was	 ow 	 ed 	 	on	them	by	making	 mark 	 s 	 	;	 mark 	 s 	 	on	clay	in	that	time	.
not	too	much	 long 	 er 	 	after	that	,	the	 alpha 	 bet 	 	was	 invent 	 ed 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	tool	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 re 	 serv 	 ed 	 	,	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	for	the	elite	 administr 	 ators 	 	who	 ke 	 pt 	 	track	of	 account 	 s 	 	for	the	 empire 	 s 	 	.
and	then	 an 	 other 	 	communication	technology	enabled	new	media	:
the	 print 	 ing 	 	press	came	 a 	 long 	 	,	and	 with 	 in 	 	 decade 	 s 	 	,	 million 	 s 	 	of	people	 be 	 came 	 	 liter 	 ate 	 	.
and	from	 liter 	 ate 	 	 population 	 s 	 	,	new	 form 	 s 	 	of	 collect 	 ive 	 	action	 emerge 	 d 	 	in	the	 sphere 	 s 	 	of	knowledge	,	 relig 	 ion 	 	and	 politic 	 s 	 	.
we	saw	scientific	 revolution 	 s 	 	,	the	protestant	 reform 	 ation 	 	,	 constit 	 ution 	 al 	 	 demo 	 cracies 	 	possible	where	they	had	not	 be 	 en 	 	possible	before	.
not	 create 	 d 	 	by	the	 print 	 ing 	 	press	,	but	enabled	by	the	 collect 	 ive 	 	action	that	 emerge 	 s 	 	from	 liter 	 acy 	 	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	new	 form 	 s 	 	of	wealth	 emerge 	 d 	 	.
now	,	commerce	is	ancient	.	 market 	 s 	 	are	 a 	 s 	 	old	 a 	 s 	 	the	 cross 	 road 	 s 	 	.
but	 capital 	 ism 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	know	it	,	is	 on 	 ly 	 	a	few	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	enabled	by	 co 	 operative 	 	 arrange 	 ments 	 	and	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	joint	-	stock	 owner 	 ship 	 	company	,	 share 	 d 	 	 li 	 ability 	 	 insur 	 ance 	 	,	double	-	entry	 book 	 keep 	 ing 	 	.
now	of	course	,	the	 enabl 	 ing 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	are	based	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,
and	in	the	 man 	 y 	 	-	to	-	 man 	 y 	 	era	,	every	 desk 	 top 	 	is	now	a	 print 	 ing 	 	press	,	a	 broad 	 cast 	 ing 	 	station	,	a	community	or	a	 market 	 place 	 	.
evolution	is	 speed 	 ing 	 	up	.
more	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	that	power	is	 un 	 tether 	 ing 	 	and	 leap 	 ing 	 	off	the	 desk 	 top 	 s 	 	,
and	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	we	're	going	to	see	a	significant	proportion	,	if	not	the	 major 	 ity 	 	of	the	human	race	,	 walk 	 ing 	 	around	 hold 	 ing 	 	,	 carry 	 ing 	 	or	 wear 	 ing 	 	 super 	 computer 	 s 	 	linked	at	 speed 	 s 	 	 great 	 er 	 	than	what	we	consider	to	be	 broad 	 band 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
now	,	when	i	 start 	 ed 	 	looking	 in 	 to 	 	 collect 	 ive 	 	action	,	the	 consider 	 able 	 	 liter 	 ature 	 	on	it	is	based	on	what	 socio 	 logists 	 	call	``	social	 dilemma 	 s 	 	.	``
and	there	are	a	couple	of	 myth 	 ic 	 	 narrative 	 s 	 	of	social	 dilemma 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	talk	 brief 	 ly 	 	about	two	of	them	:	the	prisoner	's	dilemma	and	the	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	of	the	 common 	 s 	 	.
now	,	when	i	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	with	kevin	kelly	,	he	 assur 	 ed 	 	me	that	 every 	 body 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	audience	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 know 	 s 	 	the	 detail 	 s 	 	of	the	prisoner	's	dilemma	,
so	i	'm	just	going	to	go	over	that	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
if	you	have	more	 question 	 s 	 	about	it	,	ask	kevin	kelly	 lat 	 er 	 	.
the	prisoner	's	dilemma	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	story	that	's	 over 	 laid 	 	on	a	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 m 	 atrix 	 	that	came	out	of	the	game	 theor 	 y 	 	in	the	early	 year 	 s 	 	of	 think 	 ing 	 	about	nuclear	war	:	two	 player 	 s 	 	who	could	n't	trust	each	other	.
let	me	just	say	that	every	 un 	 secure 	 d 	 	 trans 	 action 	 	is	a	good	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	a	prisoner	's	dilemma	.
person	with	the	 good 	 s 	 	,	person	with	the	money	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	ca	n't	trust	each	other	,	are	not	going	to	 ex 	 change 	 	.
 n 	 either 	 	one	 want 	 s 	 	to	be	the	first	one	or	they	're	going	to	get	the	 suck 	 er 	 	's	 pay 	 off 	 	,
but	both	lose	,	of	course	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	do	n't	get	what	they	want	.
if	they	could	 on 	 ly 	 	agree	,	if	they	could	 on 	 ly 	 	turn	a	prisoner	's	dilemma	 in 	 to 	 	a	different	 pay 	 off 	 	 m 	 atrix 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	an	assurance	game	,	they	could	proceed	.
twenty	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	robert	axelrod	used	the	prisoner	's	dilemma	 a 	 s 	 	a	 prob 	 e 	 	of	the	 bio 	 logical 	 	question	:	if	we	are	here	 be 	 cause 	 	our	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	fierce	 competitor 	 s 	 	,	how	 do 	 es 	 	 co 	 operation 	 	exist	at	all	?
he	 start 	 ed 	 	a	computer	tournament	for	people	to	submit	prisoner	's	dilemma	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	and	 discover 	 ed 	 	,	much	to	his	surprise	,	that	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	won	--
it	won	the	first	tournament	,	and	even	after	 every 	 one 	 	 k 	 new 	 	it	won	,	it	won	the	second	tournament	--	that	's	known	 a 	 s 	 	tit	for	tat	.
 an 	 other 	 	economic	game	that	may	not	be	 a 	 s 	 	well	known	 a 	 s 	 	the	prisoner	's	dilemma	is	the	ultimatum	game	,
and	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 prob 	 e 	 	of	our	 assumption 	 s 	 	about	the	way	people	make	economic	 trans 	 action 	 s 	 	.
here	's	how	the	game	is	 play 	 ed 	 	:	there	are	two	 player 	 s 	 	;
they	've	never	 play 	 ed 	 	the	game	before	,
they	will	not	play	the	game	 aga 	 in 	 	,	they	do	n't	know	each	other	,
and	they	are	,	in	fact	,	in	 separat 	 e 	 	rooms	.
first	player	is	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	a	hundred	 dollar 	 s 	 	and	is	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	 pro 	 pose 	 	a	split	:	50/50	,	90/10	,
 what 	 ever 	 	that	player	 want 	 s 	 	to	 pro 	 pose 	 	.	the	second	player	either	 accept 	 s 	 	the	split	--	both	 player 	 s 	 	are	paid	and	the	game	is	over	--
or	 reject 	 s 	 	the	split	--	 n 	 either 	 	player	is	paid	and	the	game	is	over	.
now	,	the	fundamental	 bas 	 is 	 	of	 neo 	 classic 	 al 	 	 economic 	 s 	 	would	tell	you	it	's	irrational	to	reject	a	dollar	 be 	 cause 	 	 some 	 one 	 	you	do	n't	know	in	 an 	 other 	 	room	is	going	to	get	99	.
yet	in	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 trial 	 s 	 	with	american	and	european	and	japanese	 student 	 s 	 	,	a	significant	 percent 	 age 	 	would	reject	any	 off 	 er 	 	that	's	not	close	to	50/50	.
and	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 screen 	 ed 	 	and	did	n't	know	about	the	game	and	had	never	 play 	 ed 	 	the	game	before	,	 prop 	 os 	 ers 	 	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	 innate 	 ly 	 	know	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	average	proposal	was	 surprising 	 ly 	 	close	to	50/50	.
now	,	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	part	 come 	 s 	 	in	more	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	when	 anthropo 	 logists 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	taking	 th 	 is 	 	game	to	other	 culture 	 s 	 	and	 discover 	 ed 	 	,	to	 the 	 ir 	 	surprise	,	that	 s 	 lash 	 	-	and	-	burn	 agricultur 	 alist 	 s 	 	in	the	amazon	or	 nomad 	 ic 	 	 pastor 	 alist 	 s 	 	in	central	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	or	a	dozen	different	 culture 	 s 	 	--	each	had	 radical 	 ly 	 	different	 idea 	 s 	 	of	what	is	fair	.
which	 suggest 	 s 	 	that	 in 	 stead 	 	of	there	 be 	 ing 	 	an	innate	sense	of	 fair 	 ness 	 	,	that	 some 	 how 	 	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	our	economic	 trans 	 action 	 s 	 	can	be	 influence 	 d 	 	by	our	social	 institution 	 s 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	we	know	that	or	not	.
the	other	major	narrative	of	social	 dilemma 	 s 	 	is	the	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	of	the	 common 	 s 	 	.
garrett	hardin	used	it	to	talk	about	 over 	 population 	 	in	the	late	1960s	.
he	used	the	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	a	common	grazing	area	in	which	each	person	by	 simpl 	 y 	 	 maxim 	 izing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	flock	led	to	 over 	 grazing 	 	and	the	 deple 	 tion 	 	of	the	resource	.
he	had	the	 ra 	 ther 	 	 gloom 	 y 	 	 con 	 clusion 	 	that	 human 	 s 	 	will	 inevit 	 ably 	 	 de 	 spoil 	 	any	common	pool	resource	in	which	people	can	not	be	 re 	 s 	 trained 	 	from	using	it	.
now	,	elinor	ostrom	,	a	 politic 	 al 	 	scientist	,	in	1990	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	question	that	any	good	scientist	should	ask	,
which	is	:	is	it	 re 	 ally 	 	true	that	 human 	 s 	 	will	 al 	 ways 	 	 de 	 spoil 	 	 common 	 s 	 	?
so	she	went	out	and	 look 	 ed 	 	at	what	data	she	could	find	.
she	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 case 	 s 	 	of	 human 	 s 	 	sharing	 water 	 shed 	 s 	 	,	 forest 	 ry 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	,	 fish 	 eries 	 	,	and	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	 y 	 es 	 	,	in	case	after	case	,	 human 	 s 	 	 destroy 	 ed 	 	the	 common 	 s 	 	that	they	 depend 	 ed 	 	on	.
but	she	 al 	 so 	 	found	 man 	 y 	 	 in 	 stance 	 s 	 	in	which	people	 es 	 cap 	 ed 	 	the	prisoner	's	dilemma	;
in	fact	,	the	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	of	the	 common 	 s 	 	is	a	 multi 	 player 	 	prisoner	's	dilemma	.
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	that	people	are	 on 	 ly 	 	 prisoner 	 s 	 	if	they	consider	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	be	.
they	 es 	 cape 	 	by	creating	 institution 	 s 	 	for	 collect 	 ive 	 	action	.
and	she	 discover 	 ed 	 	,	i	think	most	 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	that	among	 t 	 hose 	 	 institution 	 s 	 	that	 work 	 ed 	 	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	a	number	of	common	design
 principle 	 s 	 	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	 principle 	 s 	 	seem	to	be	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	from	 t 	 hose 	 	 institution 	 s 	 	that	do	n't	work	.
i	'm	moving	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	over	a	number	of	 discipline 	 s 	 	.	in	biology	,	the	 not 	 ions 	 	of	 sym 	 bio 	 sis 	 	,	group	 s 	 election 	 	,	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 psycho 	 logy 	 	are	 contest 	 ed 	 	,	to	be	 s 	 ure 	 	.
but	there	is	 re 	 ally 	 	no	 long 	 er 	 	any	major	debate	over	the	fact	that	 co 	 operative 	 	 arrange 	 ments 	 	have	 move 	 d 	 	from	a	 per 	 iph 	 er 	 al 	 	role	to	a	central	role	in	biology	,	from	the	level	of	the	cell	to	the	level	of	the	 eco 	 logy 	 	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	our	 not 	 ions 	 	of	 individual 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	economic	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 over 	 turn 	 ed 	 	.
rational	self	-	interest	is	not	 al 	 ways 	 	the	 domin 	 ating 	 	factor	.
in	fact	,	people	will	act	to	punish	 cheat 	 ers 	 	,	even	at	a	cost	to	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
and	most	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	 neuro 	 physiologic 	 al 	 	 measure 	 s 	 	have	 show 	 n 	 	that	people	who	punish	 cheat 	 ers 	 	in	economic	 game 	 s 	 	show	activity	in	the	reward	 center 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	brain	.
which	led	one	scientist	to	declare	that	 altruist 	 ic 	 	 punish 	 ment 	 	may	be	the	glue	that	 hold 	 s 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	together	.
now	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	how	new	 form 	 s 	 	of	communication	and	new	media	in	the	past	have	 help 	 ed 	 	create	new	economic	 form 	 s 	 	.

i	 simpl 	 y 	 	want	you	to	keep	in	mind	that	if	in	the	past	,	new	 form 	 s 	 	of	 co 	 operation 	 	enabled	by	new	 techno 	 logies 	 	create	new	 form 	 s 	 	of	wealth	,	we	may	be	moving	 in 	 to 	 	yet	 an 	 other 	 	economic	form	that	is	 significant 	 ly 	 	different	from	previous	 one 	 s 	 	.
