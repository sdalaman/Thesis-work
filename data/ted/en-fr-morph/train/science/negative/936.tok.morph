my	name	's	seth	priebatsch	.	i	'm	the	chief	 n 	 in 	 ja 	 	of	scvngr	.
i	am	a	proud	princeton	 drop 	 out 	 	.
 al 	 so 	 	proud	to	have	 re 	 locate 	 d 	 	here	to	boston	,	where	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	grew	up	.
 yea 	 h 	 	,	boston	.
easy	 win 	 s 	 	.	i	should	just	go	and	name	the	 count 	 ies 	 	that	we	've	got	around	here	.
so	,	i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	 fair 	 ly 	 	 determine 	 d 	 	to	try	and	build	a	game	layer	on	top	of	the	world	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	sort	of	a	new	 con 	 cept 	 	,	and	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	while	the	last	decade	was	the	decade	of	social	and	the	decade	of	where	the	 frame 	 work 	 	in	which	we	connect	with	other	people	was	built	,	 th 	 is 	 	next	decade	will	be	the	decade	where	the	game	 frame 	 work 	 	is	built	,	where	the	 motiv 	 ations 	 	that	we	use	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	influence	behavior	,	and	the	 frame 	 work 	 	in	which	that	is	 construct 	 ed 	 	,	is	 decide 	 d 	 	 up 	 on 	 	,	and	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
and	so	i	say	that	i	want	to	build	a	game	layer	on	top	of	the	world	,	but	that	's	not	 quit 	 e 	 	true	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 al 	 ready 	 	under	construction	;	it	's	 al 	 ready 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
and	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	right	now	.
it	 look 	 s 	 	like	the	web	did	back	in	1997	,	right	?
it	's	not	 ver 	 y 	 	good	.	it	's	 cl 	 utter 	 ed 	 	.
it	's	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	 lot 	 s 	 	of	different	 thing 	 s 	 	that	,	in	short	,	are	n't	that	 f 	 un 	 	.
there	are	credit	card	 scheme 	 s 	 	and	 air 	 line 	 	mile	 program 	 s 	 	and	 coup 	 on 	 	 card 	 s 	 	and	all	these	 loyal 	 ty 	 	 scheme 	 s 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	use	game	 dynamic 	 s 	 	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	are	building	the	game	layer	:	they	just	suck	.
they	're	not	 ver 	 y 	 	well	designed	,	right	?
so	,	that	's	 un 	 fortunate 	 	.
but	 luck 	 ily 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	action	hero	,	bob	the	 build 	 er 	 	,	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	we	can	do	better	.	we	can	build	 th 	 is 	 	better	.	``	and	the	 tool 	 s 	 	,	the	 resource 	 s 	 	that	we	use	to	build	a	game	layer	are	game	 dynamic 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
and	so	,	sort	of	,	the	crux	of	 th 	 is 	 	 present 	 ation 	 	is	going	to	go	through	four	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	game	 dynamic 	 s 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	that	,	if	you	use	 conscious 	 ly 	 	,	you	can	use	to	influence	behavior	,	both	for	good	,	for	bad	,	for	in	-	between	.
 hope 	 fully 	 	for	good	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	sort	of	the	 import 	 ant 	 	 stage 	 s 	 	in	which	that	 frame 	 work 	 	will	get	built	,	and	so	we	want	to	all	be	 think 	 ing 	 	about	it	 conscious 	 ly 	 	now	.
just	before	we	jump	 in 	 to 	 	that	,	there	's	sort	of	a	question	of	:	why	is	 th 	 is 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	?
i	'm	sort	of	making	 th 	 is 	 	claim	that	there	is	a	game	layer	on	top	of	the	world	,	and	that	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	that	we	build	it	 proper 	 ly 	 	.
the	reason	that	it	's	so	 import 	 ant 	 	is	that	,	the	last	decade	,	what	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	building	the	social	layer	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 frame 	 work 	 	for	 connect 	 ions 	 	,	and	construction	on	that	layer	is	over	,	it	's	 finish 	 ed 	 	.
there	's	still	a	lot	to	explore	.
there	's	still	a	lot	of	people	who	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	social	and	how	do	we	leverage	 th 	 is 	 	and	how	do	we	use	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	the	 frame 	 work 	 	 it 	 self 	 	is	 d 	 one 	 	,	and	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	facebook	.
and	that	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	right	?	a	lot	of	people	are	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	with	facebook	.
i	like	it	 quit 	 e 	 	a	lot	.
they	've	 create 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	thing	 call 	 ed 	 	the	open	graph	,	and	they	own	all	of	our	 connect 	 ions 	 	.
they	own	half	a	billion	people	.
and	so	when	you	want	to	build	on	the	social	layer	,	the	 frame 	 work 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	;	it	is	the	open	graph	api	.
and	if	you	're	happy	with	that	,	fantastic	.
if	you	're	not	,	too	bad	.	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	you	can	do	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	next	decade	--	and	that	's	a	real	thing	.
i	mean	,	we	want	to	build	 frame 	 work 	 s 	 	in	a	way	that	 make 	 s 	 	it	 accept 	 able 	 	and	 make 	 s 	 	it	,	you	know	,	productive	down	the	road	.
so	,	the	social	layer	is	all	about	these	 connect 	 ions 	 	.
the	game	layer	is	all	about	influence	.
it	's	not	about	 add 	 ing 	 	a	social	fabric	to	the	web	and	 connect 	 ing 	 	you	to	other	people	 every 	 where 	 	you	are	and	 every 	 where 	 	you	go	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	about	using	 dynamic 	 s 	 	,	using	 force 	 s 	 	,	to	influence	the	behavior	of	where	you	are	,	what	you	do	there	,	how	you	do	it	.
that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	,	and	it	's	going	to	be	more	 import 	 ant 	 	than	the	social	layer	.
it	's	going	to	affect	our	 live 	 s 	 	more	 deep 	 ly 	 	and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	more	 in 	 vis 	 ibly 	 	.
and	so	it	's	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	critical	that	at	 th 	 is 	 	moment	,	while	it	's	just	 get 	 ting 	 	 construct 	 ed 	 	,	while	the	 frame 	 work 	 s 	 	like	facebook	,	like	the	open	graph	,	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 create 	 d 	 	for	the	game	layer	 equi 	 valent 	 	,	that	we	think	about	it	 ver 	 y 	 	 conscious 	 ly 	 	,	and	that	we	do	it	in	a	way	that	is	open	,	that	is	 avail 	 able 	 	,	and	that	can	be	 leverage 	 d 	 	for	good	.
and	so	that	's	what	i	want	to	talk	about	for	game	 dynamic 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	construction	 ha 	 s 	 	just	 beg 	 un 	 	,	and	the	more	 conscious 	 ly 	 	we	can	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	the	better	we	'll	be	able	to	use	it	for	 any 	 thing 	 	that	we	want	.
so	like	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	the	way	that	you	go	through	and	build	on	the	game	layer	is	not	with	glass	and	steel	and	cement	.
and	the	 resource 	 s 	 	that	we	use	are	not	 th 	 is 	 	two	-	dimensional	swath	of	land	that	we	have	.
the	 resource 	 s 	 	are	 mind 	 share 	 	and	the	 tool 	 s 	 	,	the	raw	 material 	 s 	 	are	these	game	 dynamic 	 s 	 	.
so	with	that	,	you	know	,	a	couple	game	 dynamic 	 s 	 	to	talk	about	.
four	.	back	at	scvngr	,	we	like	to	joke	that	with	seven	game	 dynamic 	 s 	 	,	you	can	get	 any 	 one 	 	to	do	 any 	 thing 	 	.
and	so	 to 	 day 	 	,	i	'm	going	to	show	you	four	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	hope	to	have	a	competitive	advantage	at	the	end	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	still	.
so	the	first	one	,	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	game	dynamic	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	appointment	dynamic	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	dynamic	in	which	to	succeed	,	 player 	 s 	 	have	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	at	a	 pre 	 defined 	 	time	,	 general 	 ly 	 	at	a	 pre 	 defined 	 	place	.
and	these	 dynamic 	 s 	 	are	a	little	 scar 	 y 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	think	,	you	know	,	other	people	can	be	using	 force 	 s 	 	that	will	 manipul 	 ate 	 	how	i	interact	:	what	i	do	,	where	i	do	it	,	when	i	do	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	loss	of	free	will	that	 occur 	 s 	 	in	 game 	 s 	 	can	be	 frighten 	 ing 	 	,	so	with	each	dynamic	,	i	'm	going	to	give	three	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	:	one	that	 show 	 s 	 	how	 th 	 is 	 	is	 al 	 ready 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	used	in	the	real	world	,	so	you	can	sort	of	 rational 	 ize 	 	it	a	little	bit	;	one	that	 show 	 s 	 	it	in	what	we	consider	a	 convention 	 al 	 	game	--	i	think	 every 	 thing 	 	is	a	game	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	sort	of	more	of	a	what	you	would	think	is	a	game	 play 	 ed 	 	on	a	board	or	on	a	computer	screen	,	and	then	one	how	 th 	 is 	 	can	be	used	for	good	,	so	we	can	see	that	these	 force 	 s 	 	can	 re 	 ally 	 	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	.
so	the	first	one	--	the	most	famous	appointment	dynamic	in	the	world	--	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	happy	hour	.
so	i	just	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 drop 	 ped 	 	out	of	princeton	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	 end 	 ed 	 	up	for	the	first	time	in	a	bar	,	and	i	saw	these	happy	hour	 thing 	 s 	 	all	over	the	place	,	right	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 simpl 	 y 	 	an	appointment	dynamic	.
come	here	at	a	certain	time	,	get	your	 drink 	 s 	 	half	off	.
to	win	,	all	you	have	to	do	is	show	up	at	the	right	place	at	the	right	time	.
 th 	 is 	 	game	dynamic	is	so	 power 	 ful 	 	that	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	just	influence	our	behavior	,	it	's	 influence 	 d 	 	our	entire	culture	.
that	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 scar 	 y 	 	thought	,	that	one	game	dynamic	can	change	 thing 	 s 	 	so	 power 	 fully 	 	.
it	 al 	 so 	 	 exist 	 s 	 	in	more	 convention 	 al 	 	game	 form 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	you	've	all	heard	of	farmville	by	now	.
if	you	have	n't	,	i	recommend	 play 	 ing 	 	it	.
you	wo	n't	do	 any 	 thing 	 	else	with	the	rest	of	your	day	.
farmville	 ha 	 s 	 	more	active	 user 	 s 	 	than	twitter	.
it	's	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	,	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	dynamic	where	you	have	to	return	at	a	certain	time	to	water	your	 crop 	 s 	 	--	fake	 crop 	 s 	 	--	or	they	wilt	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	so	 power 	 ful 	 	that	,	when	they	tweak	 the 	 ir 	 	 stat 	 s 	 	,	when	they	say	your	 crop 	 s 	 	wilt	after	eight	 hour 	 s 	 	,	or	after	six	 hour 	 s 	 	,	or	after	24	 hour 	 s 	 	,	it	 change 	 s 	 	the	 life 	 cycle 	 	of	70	million	-	some	people	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	day	.
they	will	return	like	 clock 	 work 	 	at	different	 time 	 s 	 	.
so	if	they	 want 	 ed 	 	the	world	to	end	,	if	they	 want 	 ed 	 	 product 	 ivity 	 	to	stop	,	they	could	make	 th 	 is 	 	a	30	-	minute	cycle	,	and	no	one	could	do	 any 	 thing 	 	else	,	right	?
that	's	a	little	 scar 	 y 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	could	 al 	 so 	 	be	used	for	good	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	local	company	 call 	 ed 	 	 vital 	 ity 	 	,	and	they	've	 create 	 d 	 	a	product	to	help	people	take	 the 	 ir 	 	medicine	on	time	.
that	's	an	appointment	.
it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	people	do	n't	do	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.
and	they	have	these	glowcaps	,	which	,	you	know	,	flash	and	email	you	and	do	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	cool	 thing 	 s 	 	to	 re 	 mind 	 	you	to	take	your	medicine	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	that	is	n't	a	game	yet	,	but	 re 	 ally 	 	should	be	.
you	should	get	 point 	 s 	 	for	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	on	time	.
you	should	lose	 point 	 s 	 	for	not	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	on	time	.
they	should	 conscious 	 ly 	 	 recogn 	 ize 	 	that	they	've	built	an	appointment	dynamic	and	leverage	the	 game 	 s 	 	.
and	then	you	can	 re 	 ally 	 	 achiev 	 e 	 	good	in	some	 interest 	 ing 	 	ways	.
we	're	going	to	jump	onto	the	next	one	,	 may 	 be 	 	.	 y 	 es 	 	.
influence	and	 stat 	 us 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	most	famous	game	 dynamic 	 s 	 	.
it	's	used	all	over	the	place	.
it	's	used	in	your	 wallet 	 s 	 	,	right	now	.
we	all	want	that	credit	card	on	the	far	left	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	black	.
and	you	see	 some 	 one 	 	at	cvs	or	--	not	cvs	--	at	christian	dior	or	 some 	 thing 	 	,	and	then	...	i	do	n't	know	.	i	do	n't	have	a	black	card	;	i	've	got	a	 de 	 bit 	 	card	.
so	they	whip	it	out	.	and	you	see	men	,	they	have	that	black	card	.
i	want	that	 be 	 cause 	 	that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	they	're	 cool 	 er 	 	than	i	am	,	and	i	need	that	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	used	in	 game 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
``	modern	 war 	 fare 	 	,	``	one	of	the	most	 success 	 ful 	 	selling	 game 	 s 	 	of	all	time	.
i	'm	 on 	 ly 	 	a	level	four	,	but	i	 desperate 	 ly 	 	want	to	be	a	level	10	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	've	got	that	cool	red	badge	thing	,	and	that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	i	am	 some 	 how 	 	better	than	 every 	 one 	 	else	.
and	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	to	me	.	 stat 	 us 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	good	 motiv 	 ator 	 	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	used	in	more	 convention 	 al 	 	 setting 	 s 	 	and	can	be	used	more	 conscious 	 ly 	 	in	 convention 	 al 	 	 setting 	 s 	 	.
school	--	and	remember	,	i	made	it	through	one	year	,	so	i	think	i	'm	 qual 	 ified 	 	to	talk	on	school	--	is	a	game	,	it	's	just	not	a	 terr 	 ibly 	 	well	-	designed	game	,	right	.
there	are	 level 	 s 	 	.	there	are	c.	there	are	b.	there	is	a	.
there	are	 stat 	 uses 	 	.	i	mean	,	what	is	 val 	 ed 	 ic 	 tor 	 ian 	 	,	but	a	 stat 	 us 	 	?
if	we	 call 	 ed 	 	 val 	 ed 	 ic 	 tor 	 ian 	 	a	``	white	 k 	 night 	 	 pala 	 din 	 	level	20	,	``	i	think	people	would	 prob 	 ably 	 	work	a	lot	 hard 	 er 	 	.
so	school	is	a	game	,	and	there	have	 be 	 en 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 experiment 	 ations 	 	on	how	we	do	 th 	 is 	 	 proper 	 ly 	 	.
but	let	's	use	it	 conscious 	 ly 	 	.	like	why	have	 game 	 s 	 	that	you	can	lose	?
why	go	from	an	a	to	an	f	or	a	b	to	a	c	?
that	 suck 	 s 	 	.	why	not	level	-	up	?
and	at	princeton	,	they	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	 experiment 	 ed 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	,	where	they	have	 quiz 	 ze 	 s 	 	where	you	gain	experience	 point 	 s 	 	,	and	you	level	up	from	b	to	an	a	.
and	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	.
it	can	be	used	in	 interest 	 ing 	 	ways	.
the	third	one	i	want	to	talk	about	 quick 	 ly 	 	is	the	 progress 	 ion 	 	dynamic	,	where	you	have	to	sort	of	make	progress	,	you	have	to	move	through	different	 step 	 s 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	granular	fashion	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	used	all	over	the	place	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	linkedin	,	where	i	am	an	un	-	whole	individual	.
i	am	 on 	 ly 	 	85	percent	complete	on	linkedin	,	and	that	 both 	 ers 	 	me	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	so	deep	-	 seat 	 ed 	 	in	our	 psych 	 e 	 	that	when	we	're	 present 	 ed 	 	with	a	progress	bar	and	 present 	 ed 	 	with	easy	,	granular	 step 	 s 	 	to	take	to	try	and	complete	that	progress	bar	,	we	will	do	it	.
we	will	find	a	way	to	move	that	blue	line
all	the	way	to	the	right	edge	of	the	screen	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	used	in	 convention 	 al 	 	 game 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
i	mean	,	you	see	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 pala 	 din 	 	level	10	,	and	that	's	a	 pala 	 din 	 	level	20	,	and	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	fight	,	you	know	,	 orc 	 s 	 	on	the	 field 	 s 	 	of	mordor	against	the	raz	al	ghul	,	you	'd	 prob 	 ably 	 	want	to	be	the	 big 	 ger 	 	one	,	right	.
i	would	.
and	so	people	work	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	level	-	up	.
``	world	of	warcraft	``	is	one	of	the	most	 success 	 ful 	 	 game 	 s 	 	of	all	time	.
the	average	player	 s 	 pend 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	six	,	six	-	and	-	a	-	half	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	on	it	.
 the 	 ir 	 	most	 dedicate 	 d 	 	 player 	 s 	 	,	it	's	like	a	full	-	time	job	.
it	's	 insan 	 e 	 	.	and	they	have	these	 system 	 s 	 	where	you	can	level	-	up	.
and	that	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	thing	.	 progress 	 ion 	 	is	 power 	 ful 	 	.
it	can	 al 	 so 	 	be	used	in	 ver 	 y 	 	 compel 	 ling 	 	ways	for	good	.
one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	work	on	at	scvngr	is	how	do	you	use	 game 	 s 	 	to	drive	traffic	and	drive	business	to	local	 business 	 es 	 	,	to	sort	of	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	 ver 	 y 	 	key	to	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
and	here	we	have	a	game	that	people	play	.
they	go	 place 	 s 	 	,	they	do	 challeng 	 es 	 	,	they	earn	 point 	 s 	 	.
and	we	've	 introduc 	 ed 	 	a	 progress 	 ion 	 	dynamic	 in 	 to 	 	it	,	where	,	by	going	to	the	same	place	over	and	over	,	by	 do 	 ing 	 	 challeng 	 es 	 	,	by	 engag 	 ing 	 	with	the	business	,	you	move	a	green	bar	from	the	left	edge	of	the	screen	to	the	right	edge	of	the	screen	,	and	you	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 un 	 lock 	 	 reward 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 power 	 ful 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	that	we	can	see	that	it	 hook 	 s 	 	people	 in 	 to 	 	these	 dynamic 	 s 	 	,	 pull 	 s 	 	them	back	to	the	same	local	 business 	 es 	 	,	 create 	 s 	 	huge	 loyal 	 ty 	 	,	 create 	 s 	 	 engage 	 ment 	 	,	and	is	able	to	drive	 meaning 	 ful 	 	revenue	and	 f 	 un 	 	and	 engage 	 ment 	 	to	 business 	 es 	 	.
these	 progress 	 ion 	 	 dynamic 	 s 	 	are	 power 	 ful 	 	and	can	be	used	in	the	real	world	.
the	final	one	i	want	to	talk	about	--	and	it	's	a	great	one	to	end	on	--	is	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 cept 	 	of	 commun 	 al 	 	 discover 	 y 	 	,	a	dynamic	in	which	 every 	 one 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	work	together	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	.
and	 commun 	 al 	 	 discover 	 y 	 	is	 power 	 ful 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 leverage 	 s 	 	the	network	that	is	 socie 	 ty 	 	to	solve	 problem 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	used	in	some	sort	of	famous	consumer	web	 st 	 ories 	 	,	like	digg	,	which	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	you	've	all	heard	of	.
digg	is	a	 commun 	 al 	 	dynamic	to	try	to	find	and	source	the	best	news	,	the	most	 interest 	 ing 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	.
and	they	made	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	game	,	 initi 	 ally 	 	.
they	had	a	 lead 	 er 	 	board	,	where	,	if	you	 recommend 	 ed 	 	the	best	 st 	 ories 	 	,	you	would	get	 point 	 s 	 	.
and	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 motiv 	 ated 	 	people	to	find	the	best	 st 	 ories 	 	.
but	it	 be 	 came 	 	so	 power 	 ful 	 	that	there	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 cab 	 al 	 	,	a	group	of	people	,	the	top	seven	on	the	 lead 	 er 	 	board	,	who	would	work	together	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	they	 maintain 	 ed 	 	that	position	.
and	they	would	recommend	other	people	's	 st 	 ories 	 	,
and	the	game	 be 	 came 	 	more	 power 	 ful 	 	than	the	goal	.
and	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	to	end	up	 shut 	 ting 	 	down	the	 lead 	 er 	 	board	 be 	 cause 	 	while	it	was	effective	,	it	was	so	 power 	 ful 	 	that	it	 stop 	 ped 	 	sourcing	the	best	 st 	 ories 	 	and	 start 	 ed 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	people	work	to	maintain	 the 	 ir 	 	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	.
so	we	have	to	use	 th 	 is 	 	one	 care 	 fully 	 	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	used	in	 thing 	 s 	 	like	mcdonald	's	 monopol 	 y 	 	,	where	the	game	is	not	the	 monopol 	 y 	 	game	you	're	 play 	 ing 	 	,	but	the	sort	of	cottage	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	that	form	to	try	and	find	 board 	 walk 	 	,	right	.
and	now	they	're	just	looking	for	a	little	 stick 	 er 	 	that	 say 	 s 	 	``	 board 	 walk 	 	.	``
but	it	can	 al 	 so 	 	be	used	to	find	real	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	darpa	balloon	 challeng 	 e 	 	,	where	they	hid	a	couple	 balloon 	 s 	 	all	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	use	 network 	 s 	 	.
try	and	find	these	 balloon 	 s 	 	 fast 	 est 	 	,	and	the	winner	will	get	$	40,000	.	``
and	the	winner	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	group	out	of	mit	,	where	they	 create 	 d 	 	sort	of	a	pyramid	scheme	,	a	network	,	where	the	first	person	to	recommend	the	location	of	a	balloon	got	$	2,000	and	 any 	 one 	 	else	to	push	that	 recommend 	 ation 	 	up	 al 	 so 	 	got	a	cut	of	it	.
and	in	12	 hour 	 s 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	find	all	these	 balloon 	 s 	 	,	all	 a 	 cross 	 	the	country	,	right	.
 re 	 ally 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	dynamic	.
and	so	,	i	've	got	about	20	 second 	 s 	 	left	,	so	if	i	'm	going	to	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	 any 	 thing 	 	,	last	decade	was	the	decade	of	social	.
 th 	 is 	 	next	decade	is	the	decade	of	 game 	 s 	 	.
we	use	game	 dynamic 	 s 	 	to	build	on	it	.	we	build	with	 mind 	 share 	 	.
we	can	influence	behavior	.
it	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	.	it	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	.
let	's	all	build	it	together	,	let	's	do	it	well	and	have	 f 	 un 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	.
