one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 define 	 s 	 	a	tedster	is	you	've	taken	your	 pass 	 ion 	 	,	and	you	've	 turn 	 ed 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	 steward 	 ship 	 	.
you	 actual 	 ly 	 	put	action	to	the	 issue 	 s 	 	you	care	about	.
but	what	you	're	going	to	find	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	is	you	may	need	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	 elect 	 ed 	 	 official 	 s 	 	to	help	you	out	.
so	,	how	do	you	do	that	?
one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	i	should	 prob 	 ably 	 	tell	you	is	,	i	 work 	 ed 	 	for	the	 discover 	 y 	 	channel	early	in	my	 care 	 er 	 	,	and	that	sort	of	 warp 	 ed 	 	my	 frame 	 work 	 	.
so	,	when	you	start	to	think	about	 politic 	 ians 	 	,	you	've	got	to	 real 	 ize 	 	these	are	strange	 creature 	 s 	 	.
other	than	the	fact	that	they	ca	n't	tell	 direction 	 s 	 	,	and	they	have	 ver 	 y 	 	strange	 breed 	 ing 	 	 habit 	 s 	 	,	how	do	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	work	with	these	 thing 	 s 	 	?
what	we	need	to	understand	is	:	what	 drive 	 s 	 	the	 politic 	 al 	 	creature	?
and	there	are	two	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 prim 	 ary 	 	in	a	 politic 	 ian 	 	's	heart	:
one	is	reputation	and	influence	.
these	are	the	 prim 	 ary 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	by	which	a	 politic 	 ian 	 	can	do	his	job	.
the	second	one	--	 un 	 like 	 	most	 animal 	 s 	 	,	which	is	 surviv 	 al 	 	of	the	species	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	 p 	 reservation 	 	of	self	.
now	you	may	think	it	's	money	,	but	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	sort	of	a	 pr 	 oxy 	 	to	what	i	can	do	to	preserve	 my 	 self 	 	.
now	,	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	with	you	moving	your	issue	forward	is	these	 animal 	 s 	 	are	 get 	 ting 	 	 broad 	 cast 	 	to	all	the	time	.
so	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 get 	 ting 	 	your	issue	to	be	 import 	 ant 	 	?
you	can	 s 	 end 	 	them	an	email	.
well	,	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	i	've	got	so	 man 	 y 	 	viagra	 ad 	 s 	 	coming	at	me	,	your	email	is	lost	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	,	it	's	spam	.
how	about	you	get	on	the	phone	?
well	,	 chance 	 s 	 	are	i	've	got	a	 d 	 roid 	 	who	's	 pick 	 ing 	 	up	the	phone	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	they	 call 	 ed 	 	,	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	they	did	n't	like	it	.	``
that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	move	.
face	to	face	would	work	,	but	it	's	hard	to	set	it	up	.
it	's	hard	to	get	the	 con 	 text 	 	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	the	communication	to	work	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	 con 	 trib 	 ution 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	and	they	set	a	 con 	 text 	 	for	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	conversation	,	but	it	 take 	 s 	 	some	time	to	build	up	.
so	what	 actual 	 ly 	 	 work 	 s 	 	?
and	the	answer	is	 ra 	 ther 	 	strange	.
it	's	a	letter	.
we	live	in	a	digital	world	,	but	we	're	 fair 	 ly 	 	analog	 creature 	 s 	 	.
 letter 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	work	.
even	the	top	dog	 him 	 self 	 	 take 	 s 	 	time	every	day	to	read	10	 letter 	 s 	 	that	are	 pick 	 ed 	 	out	by	staff	.
i	can	tell	you	that	every	official	that	i	've	ever	 work 	 ed 	 	with	will	tell	you	about	the	 letter 	 s 	 	they	get	and	what	they	mean	.
so	,	how	are	you	going	to	write	your	letter	?
first	of	all	,	you	're	going	to	pick	up	an	analog	 de 	 vice 	 	:	a	pen	.
i	know	these	are	tough	,	and	you	may	have	a	hard	time	 get 	 ting 	 	your	hand	bent	around	it	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	critical	.
and	it	is	critical	that	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	 hand 	 write 	 	your	letter	.
it	is	so	novel	to	see	 th 	 is 	 	,	that	 some 	 body 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	an	analog	 de 	 vice 	 	and	 ha 	 s 	 	written	to	me	.
second	of	all	,	i	'm	going	to	recommend	that	you	get	 in 	 to 	 	a	 pro 	 active 	 	stance	and	write	to	your	 elect 	 ed 	 	 official 	 s 	 	at	 l 	 east 	 	once	a	month	.
here	's	my	promise	to	you	:
if	you	are	 consist 	 ent 	 	and	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	 with 	 in 	 	three	 month 	 s 	 	the	 elect 	 ed 	 	official	will	start	 call 	 ing 	 	you	when	that	issue	 come 	 s 	 	up	and	say	,	``	what	do	you	think	?	``
now	,	i	'm	going	to	give	you	a	four	 para 	 graph 	 	format	to	work	with	.
now	,	when	you	approach	these	 animal 	 s 	 	,	you	need	to	understand	there	's	a	 danger 	 ous 	 	end	to	them	,	and	you	 al 	 so 	 	need	to	approach	them	with	some	level	of	respect	and	a	little	bit	of	 war 	 iness 	 	.
so	in	 para 	 graph 	 	number	one	,	what	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	to	do	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	 th 	 is 	 	:	you	appreciate	them	.
you	may	not	appreciate	the	person	,	you	may	not	appreciate	 any 	 thing 	 	else	,	but	 may 	 be 	 	you	appreciate	the	fact	that	they	've	got	a	tough	gig	.
when	 animal 	 s 	 	are	going	to	make	a	point	,	they	make	the	point	.
they	do	n't	 s 	 pend 	 	a	lot	of	time	 d 	 ick 	 ing 	 	around	.
so	,	here	you	go	.
 para 	 graph 	 	number	two	:	you	may	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	to	just	get	 ver 	 y 	 	blunt	and	say	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	on	your	mind	.
when	you	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	do	n't	attack	people	;	you	attack	 tactic 	 s 	 	.
ad	 hom 	 in 	 em 	 	 attack 	 s 	 	will	get	you	 no 	 where 	 	.
 para 	 graph 	 	number	three	:	when	 animal 	 s 	 	are	 attack 	 ed 	 	or	 corner 	 ed 	 	,	they	will	fight	to	the	death	,	so	you	have	to	give	them	an	exit	.
most	of	the	time	,	if	they	have	an	exit	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	,	they	should	take	it	.
``	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	you	're	intelligent	.	if	you	had	the	right	information	,	you	would	have	 d 	 one 	 	the	right	thing	.	``
 last 	 ly 	 	,	you	want	to	be	the	 nurtur 	 ing 	 	agent	.
you	're	the	safe	place	to	come	in	to	.
so	,	in	 para 	 graph 	 	number	four	,	you	're	going	to	tell	people	,	``	if	no	one	is	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	you	with	 th 	 is 	 	information	,	let	me	help	.	``
 animal 	 s 	 	do	 dis 	 play 	 s 	 	.	they	do	two	 thing 	 s 	 	:
they	 war 	 n 	 	you	or	they	try	to	attract	you	and	say	,	``	we	need	to	mate	.	``
you	're	going	to	do	that	by	the	way	you	sign	your	letter	.
you	do	a	number	of	 thing 	 s 	 	:	you	're	a	vice	 p 	 resident 	 	,	you	volunteer	,	you	do	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
why	is	is	 th 	 is 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 establish 	 es 	 	the	two	 prim 	 ary 	 	 cri 	 ter 	 ia 	 	for	the	 politic 	 al 	 	creature	:	that	you	have	influence	in	a	large	sphere	,	and	that	my	 p 	 reservation 	 	 depend 	 s 	 	on	you	.
here	is	one	 ver 	 y 	 	quick	hack	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	for	the	 fed 	 s 	 	in	the	audience	.
here	's	how	you	mail	your	letter	.
first	of	all	,	you	 s 	 end 	 	the	original	to	the	 di 	 strict 	 	 off 	 ice 	 	.	so	,	you	 s 	 end 	 	the	copy	to	the	main	 off 	 ice 	 	.
if	they	follow	 proto 	 col 	 	,	they	'll	pick	up	the	phone	and	say	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	do	you	have	the	original	?	``	then	some	 d 	 roid 	 	in	the	back	 put 	 s 	 	the	name	on	a	 tickle 	 r 	 	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	oh	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 import 	 ant 	 	letter	.	``
and	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	 in 	 to 	 	the	 fold 	 er 	 	that	the	 elect 	 ed 	 	official	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	read	.
so	,	what	your	letter	 mean 	 s 	 	:
i	've	got	to	tell	you	,	we	are	all	in	a	party	,	and	 politic 	 al 	 	 official 	 s 	 	are	the	 pin 	 ata 	 s 	 	.
we	are	 har 	 angu 	 ed 	 	,	 lectur 	 ed 	 	to	,	 s 	 old 	 	,	 market 	 ed 	 	,	but	a	letter	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	one	of	the	few	 time 	 s 	 	that	we	have	honest	communication	.
i	got	 th 	 is 	 	letter	when	i	was	first	 elect 	 ed 	 	,	and	i	still	carry	it	to	every	council	 meet 	 ing 	 	i	go	to	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	at	real	 dial 	 ogue 	 	,
and	if	you	have	 steward 	 ship 	 	and	want	to	communicate	,	that	 dial 	 ogue 	 	is	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	.
so	when	you	do	that	,	here	's	what	i	can	promise	:	you	're	going	to	be	the	800	pound	gorilla	in	the	forest	.
get	writing	.
