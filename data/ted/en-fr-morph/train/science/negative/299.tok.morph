i	do	n't	speak	english	.
i	start	 s 	 peaking 	 	english	,	 learn 	 ing 	 	english	,	about	a	year	ago	.
i	speak	french	and	i	grew	up	with	french	,	so	my	english	is	franglais	.
i	'm	born	in	the	western	congo	,	in	an	area	around	here	,	and	then	went	to	university	in	kisangani	.
and	after	i	 finish 	 ed 	 	,	i	went	to	 th 	 is 	 	area	,	the	ituri	forest	.
but	what	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	--	when	i	was	about	14	,	i	grew	in	my	uncle	's	house	.
and	my	father	was	a	soldier	,	and	my	uncle	was	a	 fish 	 er 	 man 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	a	poacher	.
what	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	from	14	to	17	was	,	i	was	 assist 	 ing 	 	them	 collect 	 ing 	 	 iv 	 ory 	 	tusk	,	meat	and	 what 	 ever 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 kill 	 ing 	 	,	 po 	 ach 	 ing 	 	,	 hunt 	 ing 	 	in	the	forest	,	 br 	 ing 	 	it	in	the	main	city	to	get	access	to	the	market	.
but	 final 	 ly 	 	,	i	got	 my 	 self 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	.
around	17	to	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	 be 	 came 	 	,	 my 	 self 	 	,	a	poacher	.
and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	--	i	 believ 	 ed 	 	--	to	 continu 	 e 	 	my	 stud 	 ies 	 	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	go	to	university	,	but	my	father	was	poor	,	my	uncle	even	.
so	,	i	did	it	.
and	for	three	to	four	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	went	to	university	.
for	three	 time 	 s 	 	,	i	 appli 	 ed 	 	to	 bio 	 medical 	 	science	,	to	be	a	doctor	.
i	did	n't	succeed	.
i	was	 hav 	 ing 	 	my	 in 	 script 	 ions 	 	,	my	 ad 	 mission 	 	to	biology	.	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	way	,	i	'm	not	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
my	family	's	poor	,	my	area	do	n't	have	better	health	care	.
i	want	to	be	a	doctor	to	serve	them	.	``
three	 time 	 s 	 	,	that	 mean 	 s 	 	three	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	i	start	 get 	 ting 	 	old	.
i	say	,	``	oh	,	no	,	i	 continu 	 e 	 	.	``
so	,	i	did	 tropic 	 al 	 	 eco 	 logy 	 	and	plant	 bot 	 any 	 	.
when	i	 finish 	 ed 	 	,	i	went	to	the	ituri	forest	for	my	 intern 	 ship 	 	.
it	's	where	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 pass 	 ion 	 	with	what	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	right	up	to	now	--	i	'm	 stand 	 ing 	 	in	front	of	you	--	 do 	 ing 	 	 bot 	 any 	 	and	 wild 	 life 	 	 conserv 	 ation 	 	.
that	time	the	ituri	forest	was	 create 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	forest	 re 	 serve 	 	with	some	 animal 	 s 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	 plant 	 s 	 	.
and	the	training	center	there	was	built	around	the	scientific	congolese	staff	and	some	american	 scientist 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	.
so	,	the	okapi	faunal	 re 	 serve 	 	 protect 	 s 	 	number	--	i	think	that	is	the	largest	number	of	 elephant 	 s 	 	we	have	right	now	in	 protect 	 ed 	 	 area 	 s 	 	in	congo	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	.
and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	named	okapi	faunal	 re 	 serve 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	creature	.
that	is	a	forest	giraffe	.
i	think	you	 guy 	 s 	 	know	it	 quit 	 e 	 	well	.
here	we	have	savanna	 giraffe 	 s 	 	,	but	through	evolution	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	forest	giraffe	that	 live 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	in	congo	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	some	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 prim 	 ates 	 	.	thirteen	species	--	highest	 divers 	 ity 	 	we	can	find	in	one	single	area	in	africa	.
and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	the	ituri	forest	 it 	 self 	 	--
about	1,300	species	of	 plant 	 s 	 	,	so	far	known	.
i	 join 	 ed 	 	the	 wild 	 life 	 	 conserv 	 ation 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	 work 	 ing 	 	there	,	in	1995	,	but	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	with	them	 a 	 s 	 	a	student	in	1991	.
i	was	 ap 	 point 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 teach 	 ing 	 	 assist 	 ant 	 	at	my	university	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 accomplish 	 ed 	 	with	honor	.	but	i	did	n't	like	the	way	--	the	 instruct 	 ion 	 	i	got	was	 ver 	 y 	 	poor	.
and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	 form 	 ed 	 	to	a	training	center	and	a	research	center	.
with	the	end	of	the	 dictator 	 ship 	 	regime	of	mobutu	sese	seko	,	that	most	of	you	know	,	life	 be 	 came 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	.	and	the	work	we	have	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	was	 complete 	 ly 	 	difficult	to	do	and	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	it	.
when	kabila	 start 	 ed 	 	his	 move 	 ment 	 	to	liberate	congo	,	so	mobutu	 soldier 	 s 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	moving	and	 re 	 treat 	 ed 	 	.
so	they	 start 	 ed 	 	 flee 	 ing 	 	from	the	east	to	the	west	.
and	the	okapi	faunal	 re 	 serve 	 	is	there	,
so	there	was	a	road	from	goma	,	 some 	 where 	 	here	,	and	coming	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	they	might	go	through	,	pass	through	the	okapi	faunal	 re 	 serve 	 	.
congo	 ha 	 s 	 	five	of	the	world	's	 rich 	 est 	 	 s 	 ites 	 	of	 protect 	 ed 	 	area	,	and	the	okapi	faunal	 re 	 serve 	 	is	one	of	them	.
so	soldier	was	 flee 	 ing 	 	in	the	okapi	faunal	 re 	 serve 	 	.
on	 the 	 ir 	 	way	,	they	 loot 	 ed 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	.
torture	,	 war 	 s 	 	--	oh	,	my	god	,	you	ca	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	.
every	person	was	looking	his	way	--	where	to	go	,	we	do	n't	know	.
and	it	was	for	us	,	the	young	,	the	first	time	 re 	 ally 	 	we	hear	the	language	of	war	,	of	 gun 	 s 	 	.
and	even	people	who	 face 	 d 	 	the	 rebel 	 lion 	 	of	1963	,	after	our	 in 	 depend 	 ence 	 	,	they	did	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	what	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 kill 	 ing 	 	people	.	they	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 what 	 ever 	 	they	want	 be 	 cause 	 	they	have	power	.
who	have	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	that	?
young	children	.	child	 soldier 	 s 	 	.
you	ca	n't	ask	him	how	old	he	is	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 ha 	 s 	 	 gun 	 s 	 	.
but	i	was	from	the	west	,	 work 	 ing 	 	in	the	east	.	i	even	[	at	]	that	time	was	not	 s 	 peaking 	 	swahili	.
and	when	they	came	,	they	 loot 	 ed 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	.
you	ca	n't	speak	lingala	 be 	 cause 	 	lingala	was	from	mobutu	,	and	 every 	 one 	 	 s 	 peaking 	 	lingala	is	soldier	.
and	i	was	from	the	same	area	to	him	.
all	my	 friend 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	we	are	 leav 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	are	a	target	.
but	i	'm	not	going	to	the	east	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	do	n't	know	swahili	.
i	stay	.	if	i	go	,	i	will	be	 kill 	 ed 	 	.
i	ca	n't	go	back	to	my	area	--	it	's	more	than	1,000	 kilometer 	 s 	 	[	away	]	.
i	 stay 	 ed 	 	after	they	 loot 	 ed 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	.
we	have	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	research	on	 bot 	 any 	 	,
and	we	have	a	small	 herb 	 arium 	 	of	4,500	 sheet 	 s 	 	of	 plant 	 s 	 	.
we	cut	,	we	dry	and	we	 pack 	 ed 	 	them	,
we	 mount 	 ed 	 	them	on	a	 fold 	 er 	 	.
purpose	:	so	that	we	start	them	for	 agricultur 	 e 	 	,	for	medicine	,	for	 what 	 ever 	 	,	and	for	science	,	for	the	 stud 	 y 	 	of	the	 flor 	 a 	 	and	the	change	of	the	forest	.
that	is	people	moving	around	,	that	's	even	 pyg 	 mies 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	bright	guy	,	hard	-	 work 	 ing 	 	person	,	and	 pyg 	 my 	 	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	with	him	about	10	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	with	 soldier 	 s 	 	,	they	went	to	the	forest	for	 po 	 ach 	 ing 	 	 elephant 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	he	's	 pyg 	 my 	 	,	he	 know 	 s 	 	how	to	track	 elephant 	 s 	 	in	the	forest	.
he	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 attack 	 ed 	 	by	a	leopard	and	they	abandon	him	in	the	forest	.
they	came	to	told	me	,	i	have	to	 s 	 ave 	 	him	.
and	what	i	did	,	i	 g 	 ave 	 	him	just	 anti 	 biotic 	 s 	 	that	we	care	for	 tube 	 rculosis 	 	.	and	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	i	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	his	life	.
and	that	was	the	language	of	the	war	.
 every 	 where 	 	there	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	constant	 extra 	 ction 	 	of	mineral	,	 kill 	 ing 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	,	the	logging	 timber 	 s 	 	and	so	on	.
and	what	of	 import 	 ant 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	--	i	think	all	of	you	here	have	a	cell	phone	.
that	mineral	 ha 	 s 	 	 kill 	 ed 	 	a	lot	:	five	 million 	 s 	 	of	congolese	have	gone	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	colombo	-	tantalite	--	they	call	it	 col 	 tan 	 	--	that	they	use	it	to	make	cell	 phone 	 s 	 
and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	in	that	area	,	all	over	in	congo	.	 extra 	 ction 	 	,	and	good	,	big	business	of	the	war	.
and	what	i	did	for	the	first	war	,	after	we	have	lost	 every 	 thing 	 	,	i	have	to	 s 	 ave 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	,	even	 my 	 self 	 	,	my	life	and	life	of	the	staff	.
i	buried	some	of	our	new	vehicle	 engine 	 s 	 	,	i	buried	it	to	 s 	 ave 	 	it	.
and	some	of	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	went	with	them	,	on	the	top	of	the	 can 	 opy 	 	,	to	 s 	 ave 	 	it	.
he	's	not	 collect 	 ing 	 	 plant 	 s 	 	,	he	's	going	to	 s 	 ave 	 	our	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	on	the	 can 	 opy 	 	.
and	with	the	material	that	's	left	--	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	destroy	it	,	to	burn	it	,	they	did	n't	understand	it	,	they	did	n't	go	to	school	--	i	 pack 	 ed 	 	it	.
and	that	is	me	,	going	to	,	 hur 	 ry 	 ing 	 	to	uganda	,	to	try	to	 s 	 ave 	 	that	4,000	material	,	with	people	 carry 	 ing 	 	them	on	the	 bike 	 s 	 	,	 bi 	 cycle 	 s 	 	.
and	after	that	,	we	 succeed 	 ed 	 	.
i	 house 	 d 	 	that	4,000	material	at	the	 herb 	 arium 	 	of	makerere	university	.
and	after	the	war	,	i	have	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	 br 	 ing 	 	it	back	home	,	so	that	we	 continu 	 e 	 	our	 stud 	 ies 	 	.
the	second	war	came	while	we	did	n't	expect	it	.
with	 friend 	 s 	 	,	we	had	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	and	 watch 	 ing 	 	match	 foot 	 ball 	 	,	and	 hav 	 ing 	 	some	good	music	with	worldspace	radio	,	when	it	 start 	 ed 	 	,	i	think	.
so	,	it	was	so	bad	.
we	heard	that	now	from	the	east	 aga 	 in 	 	the	war	 start 	 ed 	 	,	and	it	's	going	fast	.
 th 	 is 	 	time	i	think	kabila	will	go	in	place	of	,	 a 	 s 	 	he	did	with	mobutu	.
and	the	 re 	 serve 	 	was	a	target	to	the	 rebel 	 s 	 	.
three	different	 move 	 ments 	 	and	two	militia	 act 	 ing 	 	in	the	same	area	and	 com 	 pet 	 ing 	 	for	natural	 resource 	 s 	 	.
and	there	was	no	way	to	work	.
they	destroy	 every 	 thing 	 	.
 po 	 ach 	 ing 	 	--	oh	,	no	way	.
and	that	's	the	 power 	 ful 	 	men	.	we	have	to	meet	and	to	talk	to	them	.	what	's	the	 regulat 	 ion 	 	of	the	 re 	 serve 	 	and	what	is	the	 regulat 	 ion 	 	of	the	 park 	 s 	 	?	and	they	ca	n't	do	what	they	are	 do 	 ing 	 	.
so	we	went	to	meet	them	.
that	is	 col 	 tan 	 	 extra 	 ction 	 	,	gold	 min 	 ing 	 	.
so	,	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	with	them	,	convincing	them	that	we	are	in	a	 protect 	 ed 	 	area	.	there	are	 regulat 	 ions 	 	that	it	's	 prohibit 	 ed 	 	to	do	logging	,	 min 	 ing 	 	and	 po 	 ach 	 ing 	 	,	 specific 	 ally 	 	.
but	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	 guy 	 s 	 	,	you	think	that	 soldier 	 s 	 	who	are	 dy 	 ing 	 	are	not	 import 	 ant 	 	,	and	your	 animal 	 s 	 	you	are	 protect 	 ing 	 	are	most	 import 	 ant 	 	.
we	do	n't	think	so	.
we	have	to	do	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	to	let	our	 move 	 ment 	 	advance	.	``
i	say	,	``	no	way	,	you	are	not	going	to	do	it	here	.	``
we	 start 	 ed 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	with	them	and	i	was	 negoti 	 ating 	 	.
 tri 	 ed 	 	to	protect	our	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	,	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	protect	our	staff	and	the	 village 	 s 	 	of	about	1,500	people	.
and	we	 continu 	 ed 	 	.
but	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	that	,	 negoti 	 ating 	 	with	them	.	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	we	are	 hav 	 ing 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 	and	they	are	 talk 	 ing 	 	with	jean	-	pierre	bemba	,	with	mbusa	nyamwisi	,	with	kabila	,	and	i	'm	there	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	they	talk	to	my	own	language	,	that	is	,	lingala	.
i	hear	it	and	what	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	they	are	 do 	 ing 	 	,	what	they	are	 plan 	 ning 	 	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	they	are	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	helicopter	to	supply	them	with	 am 	 mun 	 ition 	 	and	so	on	.
they	used	me	to	carry	that	,	and	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ing 	 	,	what	 come 	 s 	 	from	where	,	and	where	,	and	where	.
i	had	 on 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	--	my	satellite	phone	,	my	computer	and	a	plastic	solar	 pan 	 el 	 	--	that	i	hide	it	in	the	forest	.
and	every	time	,	 dai 	 ly 	 	,	after	we	have	 meet 	 ing 	 	,	what	 com 	 promise 	 	we	have	,	 what 	 ever 	 	,	i	go	,	i	write	a	short	email	,	 s 	 end 	 	it	.
i	do	n't	know	how	 man 	 y 	 	people	i	had	on	my	address	.
i	 s 	 ent 	 	the	 mess 	 age 	 	:	what	is	going	about	the	progress	of	the	war	and	what	they	are	 plan 	 ning 	 	to	do	.
they	 start 	 ed 	 	 suspect 	 ing 	 	that	what	we	do	on	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	and	the	afternoon	,	it	's	on	the	news	,	bbc	,	rfi	.
 some 	 thing 	 	might	be	going	on	.
and	one	day	,	we	went	for	a	 meet 	 ing 	 	.
sorry	.
one	day	,	we	went	to	meet	the	chief	 command 	 er 	 	.
he	had	the	same	 irid 	 ium 	 	cell	phone	like	me	.
and	he	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	,	``	do	you	know	how	to	use	 th 	 is 	 	?	``	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	have	never	 s 	 een 	 	it	.
i	do	n't	know	.	``
and	i	had	mine	on	my	pocket	.
so	,	it	was	a	chance	that	they	 trust 	 ed 	 	me	a	lot	.	they	did	n't	--	they	was	not	looking	on	me	.
so	i	was	 scar 	 ed 	 	.
and	when	we	 finish 	 ed 	 	the	 meet 	 ing 	 	,	i	went	to	return	it	in	the	forest	.
and	i	was	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	news	,	 do 	 ing 	 	 what 	 ever 	 	,
 report 	 ing 	 	 dai 	 ly 	 	to	the	u.n.	,	to	unesco	,	to	our	institution	in	new	york	,	what	have	 be 	 en 	 	going	.
and	for	that	,	they	have	 be 	 en 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	big	pressure	to	 leav 	 e 	 	,	to	free	the	area	.
 be 	 cause 	 	there	was	no	way	--	 what 	 ever 	 	they	do	,	it	's	known	the	same	time	.
 dur 	 ing 	 	the	first	two	 re 	 bell 	 ions 	 	,	they	 kill 	 ed 	 	all	 animal 	 s 	 	in	the	zoo	.
we	have	a	zoo	of	14	okapis	,	and	one	of	them	was	 pregn 	 ant 	 	.
and	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	war	,	after	a	week	of	heavy	war	,	 fight 	 ing 	 	in	the	area	,	we	 succeed 	 ed 	 	:	we	had	the	first	okapi	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 trou 	 s 	 er 	 	and	shirt	 re 	 mind 	 	me	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	local	population	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 rebel 	 s 	 	.
they	are	now	happy	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	the	news	that	they	have	 protect 	 ed 	 	the	okapi	with	the	war	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 s 	 ent 	 	the	news	that	they	are	 kill 	 ing 	 	and	 po 	 ach 	 ing 	 	 every 	 where 	 	.
after	a	week	,	we	 celebr 	 ated 	 	the	 birth 	 day 	 	of	that	okapi	,	they	 kill 	 ed 	 	an	elephant	,	just	50	 meter 	 s 	 	to	the	area	where	the	zoo	,	where	okapi	was	born	.
and	i	was	mad	.
i	 oppos 	 e 	 	it	--	that	they	are	now	going	to	dissect	it	,	 un 	 til 	 	i	do	my	report	and	then	i	see	the	chief	 command 	 er 	 	.	and	i	 succeed 	 ed 	 	.
the	elephant	just	 decay 	 ed 	 	and	they	just	got	the	 tusk 	 s 	 	.
what	we	are	 do 	 ing 	 	after	that	--	that	was	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	of	the	war	--	we	have	to	 re 	 build 	 	.
i	had	some	money	.	i	was	paid	150	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
i	 devote 	 d 	 	half	of	it	to	 re 	 build 	 	the	 herb 	 arium 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	did	n't	have	good	 infra 	 structure 	 	to	start	 plant 	 s 	 	.
 wild 	 life 	 	 conserv 	 ation 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	more	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	 plant 	 s 	 	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	with	70	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	and	start	 fund 	 raising 	 	money	to	where	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	going	.
i	had	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	go	all	over	,	where	 herb 	 arium 	 	for	my	african	material	is	.	and	they	 support 	 ed 	 	me	a	bit	,	and	i	built	 th 	 is 	 	.
now	,	it	's	 do 	 ing 	 	work	to	train	young	congolese	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	,	what	one	of	the	 special 	 ity 	 	we	are	 do 	 ing 	 	,	my	design	is	 track 	 ing 	 	the	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	effect	on	 bio 	 divers 	 ity 	 	,	and	what	the	 impact 	 s 	 	of	the	ituri	forest	is	 play 	 ing 	 	to	 up 	 take 	 	carbon	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	 stud 	 ies 	 	we	are	 do 	 ing 	 	on	a	40	-	hectare	plot	,	where	we	have	 tag 	 ged 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	and	 lian 	 a 	 s 	 	from	one	 centimeter 	 s 	 	,	and	we	are	 track 	 ing 	 	them	.
we	have	now	data	of	about	15	 year 	 s 	 	,	to	see	how	that	forest	is	 con 	 trib 	 uting 	 	to	the	carbon	 reduc 	 tions 	 	.
and	that	is	--	i	think	it	's	difficult	for	me	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 embarrass 	 ing 	 	talk	,	i	know	.	i	do	n't	know	where	to	start	,	where	to	finish	it	.
when	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	to	come	here	,	what	best	title	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	say	to	my	talk	,	i	did	n't	find	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	now	i	think	that	i	would	have	titled	it	,	``	the	language	of	 gun 	 s 	 	.	``
where	are	you	people	?
now	we	are	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 re 	 constit 	 ution 	 	,	 re 	 build 	 	africa	.
but	is	gun	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	a	tool	to	 re 	 build 	 	,	or	is	it	a	game	?
i	think	we	see	the	war	like	a	game	--	like	soccer	,	 foot 	 ball 	 	.
 every 	 body 	 	is	happy	,	but	see	what	it	's	 do 	 ing 	 	,
see	what	is	going	in	darfur	.
now	we	say	,	oh	,	my	god	.
see	what	the	 war 	 s 	 	in	rwanda	.
that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	language	of	 gun 	 s 	 	.
i	do	n't	think	that	 some 	 one 	 	may	blame	google	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 do 	 ing 	 	the	right	 thing 	 s 	 	,	even	if	people	like	al-qaeda	are	using	google	to	connect	between	them	.
but	it	's	 serv 	 ing 	 	 million 	 s 	 	for	the	best	.
but	what	is	 do 	 ing 	 	with	gun	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	?
thank	you	.	chris	anderson	:	thank	you	,	thank	you	.
just	wait	over	there	.
it	's	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	story	.
i	suspect	a	lot	of	people	here	have	the	same	question	i	have	.
how	can	we	help	you	?
corneille	ewango	:	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 embarrass 	 ing 	 	 question 	 s 	 	.
i	think	that	now	i	feel	nervous	.
and	i	think	,	 help 	 ing 	 	us	,	people	are	 act 	 ing 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	by	 ignor 	 ance 	 	.
i	did	it	 my 	 self 	 	.
if	i	know	when	i	was	young	,	that	[	by	]	 kill 	 ing 	 	an	elephant	,	i	'm	 destroy 	 ing 	 	 bio 	 divers 	 ity 	 	,	i	would	not	have	 d 	 one 	 	it	.
 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	have	 s 	 een 	 	the	 talent 	 s 	 	of	africans	,	but	there	are	few	who	are	going	to	school	.
 man 	 y 	 	are	 dy 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	all	 t 	 hose 	 	kind	of	 pan 	 demic 	 s 	 	,
hiv	,	malaria	,	poverty	,	not	going	to	school	.
what	you	can	assist	us	,	it	's	by	building	 cap 	 a 	 cities 	 	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	have	got	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	like	me	to	go	to	u.s.	,	do	a	master	's	?	and	go	--	now	,	i	'm	in	the	netherlands	to	do	a	ph.d	.
but	 man 	 y 	 	of	them	are	just	here	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	do	n't	have	money	.
and	they	ca	n't	go	even	to	university	.
they	ca	n't	even	attain	the	bachelor	's	degree	.
building	 cap 	 a 	 cities 	 	for	the	young	generation	is	going	to	make	a	better	generation	and	a	better	future	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	for	africa	.
ca	:	thank	you	,	thank	you	.
