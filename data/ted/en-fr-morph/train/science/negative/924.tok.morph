 to 	 day 	 	,	i	'm	going	to	take	you	around	the	world	in	18	 minute 	 s 	 	.
my	base	of	 operation 	 s 	 	is	in	the	u.s.	,	but	let	's	start	at	the	other	end	of	the	map	,	in	kyoto	,	japan	,	where	i	was	living	with	a	japanese	family	while	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	part	of	my	 dissert 	 ation 	 al 	 	research	15	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
i	 k 	 new 	 	even	then	that	i	would	 en 	 counter 	 	cultural	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	and	 mis 	 understand 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	but	they	 pop 	 ped 	 	up	when	i	 l 	 east 	 	 expect 	 ed 	 	it	.
on	my	first	day	,	i	went	to	a	restaurant	,	and	i	 order 	 ed 	 	a	cup	of	green	tea	with	sugar	.
after	a	pause	,	the	 wait 	 er 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	one	 do 	 es 	 	not	put	sugar	in	green	tea	.	``
``	i	know	,	``	i	 s 	 aid 	 	.	``	i	'm	aware	of	 th 	 is 	 	custom	.
but	i	 re 	 ally 	 	like	my	tea	sweet	.	``	in	 respons 	 e 	 	,	he	 g 	 ave 	 	me	an	even	more	 court 	 eous 	 	version	of	the	same	 explan 	 ation 	 	.
``	one	 do 	 es 	 	not	put	sugar	in	green	tea	.	``	``	i	understand	,	``	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	that	the	japanese	do	not	put	sugar	in	 the 	 ir 	 	green	tea	,
but	i	'd	like	to	put	some	sugar	in	my	green	tea	.	``	 surprise 	 d 	 	by	my	 insist 	 ence 	 	,	the	 wait 	 er 	 	took	up	the	issue	with	the	 manage 	 r 	 	.
 pre 	 tty 	 	soon	,	a	 length 	 y 	 	 discuss 	 ion 	 	 en 	 su 	 ed 	 	,	and	 final 	 ly 	 	the	 manage 	 r 	 	came	over	to	me	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	am	 ver 	 y 	 	sorry	.	we	do	not	have	sugar	.	``
well	,	since	i	could	n't	have	my	tea	the	way	i	 want 	 ed 	 	it	,	i	 order 	 ed 	 	a	cup	of	coffee	,	which	the	 wait 	 er 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	over	 prompt 	 ly 	 	.
 rest 	 ing 	 	on	the	saucer	 we 	 re 	 	two	 pack 	 et 	 s 	 	of	sugar	.
my	failure	to	 pro 	 cure 	 	 my 	 self 	 	a	cup	of	sweet	,	green	tea	was	not	due	to	a	simple	 mis 	 understand 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	due	to	a	fundamental	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	our	 idea 	 s 	 	about	choice	.
from	my	american	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	when	a	 pay 	 ing 	 	 custom 	 er 	 	 make 	 s 	 	a	 reason 	 able 	 	request	based	on	her	 pre 	 ference 	 s 	 	,	she	 ha 	 s 	 	every	right	to	have	that	request	met	.
the	american	way	,	to	quote	burger	king	,	is	to	``	have	it	your	way	,	``	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	starbucks	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	happiness	is	in	your	 choice 	 s 	 	.	``
but	from	the	japanese	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	it	's	 the 	 ir 	 	duty	to	protect	 t 	 hose 	 	who	do	n't	know	any	better	--	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	the	 ignor 	 ant 	 	 gai 	 j 	 in 	 	--	from	making	the	wrong	choice	.
let	's	face	it	:	the	way	i	 want 	 ed 	 	my	tea	was	 in 	 appropriate 	 	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	cultural	 standard 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	best	to	help	me	 s 	 ave 	 	face	.
americans	tend	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	they	've	 reach 	 ed 	 	some	sort	of	pinnacle	in	the	way	they	practice	choice	.
they	think	that	choice	,	 a 	 s 	 	 s 	 een 	 	through	the	american	lens	best	 fulfill 	 s 	 	an	innate	and	universal	 desir 	 e 	 	for	choice	in	all	 human 	 s 	 	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	these	 belief 	 s 	 	are	based	on	 assumption 	 s 	 	that	do	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	hold	true	in	 man 	 y 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	in	 man 	 y 	 	 culture 	 s 	 	.
at	 time 	 s 	 	they	do	n't	even	hold	true	at	america	's	own	 border 	 s 	 	.
i	'd	like	to	discuss	some	of	these	 assumption 	 s 	 	and	the	 problem 	 s 	 	 associate 	 d 	 	with	them	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	do	so	,	i	hope	you	'll	start	 think 	 ing 	 	about	some	of	your	own	 assumption 	 s 	 	and	how	they	 we 	 re 	 	shaped	by	your	 back 	 ground 	 s 	 	.
first	assumption	:	if	a	choice	 affect 	 s 	 	you	,	then	you	should	be	the	one	to	make	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	to	ensure	that	your	 pre 	 ference 	 s 	 	and	 interest 	 s 	 	will	be	most	fully	 account 	 ed 	 	for	.
it	is	essential	for	success	.
in	america	,	the	 prim 	 ary 	 	 locu 	 s 	 	of	choice	is	the	individual	.
people	must	 choos 	 e 	 	for	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 stick 	 ing 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 gun 	 s 	 	,	 regard 	 less 	 	of	what	other	people	want	or	recommend	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 be 	 ing 	 	true	to	 your 	 self 	 	.	``
but	do	all	 individual 	 s 	 	benefit	from	taking	 s 	 uch 	 	an	approach	to	choice	?
mark	lepper	and	i	did	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 stud 	 ies 	 	in	which	we	 s 	 ought 	 	the	answer	to	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	question	.
in	one	 stud 	 y 	 	,	which	we	ran	in	japantown	,	san	francisco	,	we	 br 	 ought 	 	seven	-	to	nine	-	year	-	old	anglo	-	and	asian	-	american	children	 in 	 to 	 	the	 labor 	 atory 	 	,	and	we	 divid 	 ed 	 	them	up	 in 	 to 	 	three	 group 	 s 	 	.
the	first	group	came	in	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 greet 	 ed 	 	by	 mis 	 s 	 	smith	,	who	 show 	 ed 	 	them	six	big	 pile 	 s 	 	of	 ana 	 gram 	 	 puzzl 	 es 	 	.
the	 kid 	 s 	 	got	to	 choos 	 e 	 	which	pile	of	 ana 	 gram 	 s 	 	they	would	like	to	do	,
and	they	even	got	to	 choos 	 e 	 	which	marker	they	would	write	 the 	 ir 	 	 answer 	 s 	 	with	.
when	the	second	group	of	children	came	in	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	to	the	same	room	,	 show 	 n 	 	the	same	 ana 	 gram 	 s 	 	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	time	 mis 	 s 	 	smith	told	them	which	 ana 	 gram 	 s 	 	to	do	and	which	 marker 	 s 	 	to	write	 the 	 ir 	 	 answer 	 s 	 	with	.
now	when	the	third	group	came	in	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	told	that	 the 	 ir 	 	 ana 	 gram 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 marker 	 s 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	 chose 	 n 	 	by	 the 	 ir 	 	 mother 	 s 	 	.
in	 re 	 ality 	 	,	the	 kid 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	told	what	to	do	,	 whet 	 her 	 	by	 mis 	 s 	 	smith	or	 the 	 ir 	 	 mother 	 s 	 	,	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 give 	 n 	 	the	 ver 	 y 	 	same	activity	,	which	 the 	 ir 	 	 counter 	 part 	 s 	 	in	the	first	group	had	 free 	 ly 	 	 chose 	 n 	 	.
with	 th 	 is 	 	procedure	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	ensure	that	the	 kid 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	three	 group 	 s 	 	all	did	the	same	activity	,	making	it	 eas 	 ier 	 	for	us	to	 compar 	 e 	 	performance	.
 s 	 uch 	 	small	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	in	the	way	we	 administer 	 ed 	 	the	activity	 yield 	 ed 	 	 s 	 tri 	 king 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	in	how	well	they	 perform 	 ed 	 	.
anglo	-	americans	,	they	did	two	and	a	half	 time 	 s 	 	more	 ana 	 gram 	 s 	 	when	they	got	to	 choos 	 e 	 	them	,	 a 	 s 	 	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	when	it	was	 chose 	 n 	 	for	them	by	 mis 	 s 	 	smith	or	 the 	 ir 	 	 mother 	 s 	 	.
it	did	n't	matter	who	did	the	 choos 	 ing 	 	,	if	the	task	was	 dict 	 ated 	 	by	 an 	 other 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	performance	 suffer 	 ed 	 	.
in	fact	,	some	of	the	 kid 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 vis 	 ibly 	 	 embarrass 	 ed 	 	when	they	 we 	 re 	 	told	that	 the 	 ir 	 	 mother 	 s 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	 consult 	 ed 	 	.
one	girl	named	mary	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	 ask 	 ed 	 	my	mother	?	``
in	contrast	,	asian	-	american	children	 perform 	 ed 	 	best	when	they	 believ 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 mother 	 s 	 	had	made	the	choice	,	second	best	when	they	chose	for	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	and	 l 	 east 	 	well	when	it	had	 be 	 en 	 	 chose 	 n 	 	by	 mis 	 s 	 	smith	.
a	girl	named	natsumi	even	 approach 	 ed 	 	 mis 	 s 	 	smith	 a 	 s 	 	she	was	 leav 	 ing 	 	the	room	and	 tugg 	 ed 	 	on	her	skirt	and	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	``	could	you	 pleas 	 e 	 	tell	my	 mom 	 my 	 	i	did	it	just	like	she	 s 	 aid 	 	?	``	the	first	-	generation	children	 we 	 re 	 	 strong 	 ly 	 	 influence 	 d 	 	by	 the 	 ir 	 	 im 	 migrant 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	'	approach	to	choice	.
for	them	,	choice	was	not	just	a	way	of	 defi 	 ning 	 	and	 assert 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 individual 	 ity 	 	,	but	a	way	to	create	community	and	 harmon 	 y 	 	by	 de 	 ferr 	 ing 	 	to	the	 choice 	 s 	 	of	people	whom	they	 trust 	 ed 	 	and	 respect 	 ed 	 	.
if	they	had	a	 con 	 cept 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	true	to	one	's	self	,	then	that	self	,	most	 like 	 ly 	 	,	[	was	]	 compose 	 d 	 	,	not	of	an	individual	,	but	of	a	 collect 	 ive 	 	.
success	was	just	 a 	 s 	 	much	about	 pleas 	 ing 	 	key	 figure 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	was	about	 satisfy 	 ing 	 	one	's	own	 pre 	 ference 	 s 	 	.
or	,	you	could	say	that	the	individual	's	 pre 	 ference 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	shaped	by	the	 pre 	 ference 	 s 	 	of	specific	 other 	 s 	 	.
the	assumption	then	that	we	do	best	when	the	individual	self	 choos 	 es 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 hold 	 s 	 	when	that	self	is	 clear 	 ly 	 	 divid 	 ed 	 	from	 other 	 s 	 	.
when	,	in	contrast	,	two	or	more	 individual 	 s 	 	see	 the 	 ir 	 	 choice 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 intima 	 te 	 ly 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	,	then	they	may	 ampl 	 ify 	 	one	 an 	 other 	 	's	success	by	 turn 	 ing 	 	 choos 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 collect 	 ive 	 	act	.
to	insist	that	they	 choos 	 e 	 	 in 	 dependent 	 ly 	 	might	 actual 	 ly 	 	 com 	 promise 	 	both	 the 	 ir 	 	performance	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 relationship 	 s 	 	.
yet	that	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	the	american	paradigm	 demand 	 s 	 	.
it	 leav 	 es 	 	little	room	for	 inter 	 depend 	 ence 	 	or	an	 acknowledg 	 ment 	 	of	individual	 fall 	 ibility 	 	.
it	 requir 	 es 	 	that	 every 	 one 	 	treat	choice	 a 	 s 	 	a	private	and	self	-	 defi 	 ning 	 	act	.
people	that	have	grown	up	in	 s 	 uch 	 	a	paradigm	might	find	it	 motiv 	 ating 	 	,
but	it	is	a	 mistak 	 e 	 	to	 assum 	 e 	 	that	 every 	 one 	 	 thriv 	 es 	 	under	the	pressure	of	 choos 	 ing 	 	 al 	 one 	 	.
the	second	assumption	which	 inform 	 s 	 	the	american	view	of	choice	 go 	 es 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
the	more	 choice 	 s 	 	you	have	,	the	more	 like 	 ly 	 	you	are	to	make	the	best	choice	.

you	will	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	find	the	perfect	match	.
let	's	test	 th 	 is 	 	assumption	by	 head 	 ing 	 	over	to	eastern	europe	.
here	,	i	 interview 	 ed 	 	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	 resident 	 s 	 	of	 form 	 er 	 ly 	 	 commun 	 ist 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	who	had	all	 face 	 d 	 	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	of	 transit 	 ion 	 ing 	 	to	a	more	 democrat 	 ic 	 	and	 capital 	 istic 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
one	of	the	most	 interest 	 ing 	 	 revel 	 ations 	 	came	not	from	an	answer	to	a	question	,	but	from	a	simple	 gest 	 ure 	 	of	 hospital 	 ity 	 	.
when	the	 particip 	 ants 	 	 arriv 	 ed 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	interview	,	i	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	them	a	set	of	 drink 	 s 	 	:	 co 	 ke 	 	,	diet	 co 	 ke 	 	,	sprite	--	seven	,	to	be	exact	.
 dur 	 ing 	 	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	session	,	which	was	run	in	russia	,	one	of	the	 particip 	 ants 	 	made	a	comment	that	 re 	 ally 	 	caught	me	off	guard	.
``	oh	,	but	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	.
it	's	all	just	soda	.	that	's	just	one	choice	.	``	i	was	so	 s 	 truck 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	comment	that	from	then	on	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	 off 	 er 	 	all	the	 particip 	 ants 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	seven	 soda 	 s 	 	,
and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	,	``	how	 man 	 y 	 	 choice 	 s 	 	are	these	?	``
 aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	they	 perceive 	 d 	 	these	seven	different	 soda 	 s 	 	,	not	 a 	 s 	 	seven	 choice 	 s 	 	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	one	choice	:	soda	or	no	soda	.
when	i	put	out	juice	and	water	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	these	seven	 soda 	 s 	 	,	now	they	 perceive 	 d 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	three	 choice 	 s 	 	--	juice	,	water	and	soda	.
 compar 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	to	the	die	-	hard	devotion	of	 man 	 y 	 	americans	,	not	just	to	a	 part 	 icular 	 	flavor	of	soda	,	but	to	a	 part 	 icular 	 	brand	.
you	know	,	research	 show 	 s 	 	 repeat 	 ed 	 ly 	 	that	we	ca	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	tell	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	 co 	 ke 	 	and	pepsi	.
of	course	,	you	and	i	know	that	 co 	 ke 	 	is	the	better	choice	.
for	modern	americans	who	are	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	to	more	 option 	 s 	 	and	more	 ad 	 s 	 	 associate 	 d 	 	with	 option 	 s 	 	than	 any 	 one 	 	else	in	the	world	,	choice	is	just	 a 	 s 	 	much	about	who	they	are	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	about	what	the	product	is	.
combine	 th 	 is 	 	with	the	assumption	that	more	 choice 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 ways 	 	better	,	and	you	have	a	group	of	people	for	whom	every	little	 differ 	 ence 	 	 matter 	 s 	 	and	so	every	choice	 matter 	 s 	 	.
but	for	eastern	europeans	,	the	sudden	 avail 	 ability 	 	of	all	these	consumer	 product 	 s 	 	on	the	 market 	 place 	 	was	a	 del 	 uge 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 flood 	 ed 	 	with	choice	before	they	could	protest	that	they	did	n't	know	how	to	swim	.
when	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	``	what	 word 	 s 	 	and	 image 	 s 	 	do	you	associate	with	choice	?	``	grzegorz	from	warsaw	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	ah	,	for	me	it	is	fear	.

i	do	n't	mean	to	say	that	i	want	no	choice	,	but	 man 	 y 	 	of	these	 choice 	 s 	 	are	 quit 	 e 	 	artificial	.	``	in	 re 	 ality 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 choice 	 s 	 	are	between	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	not	that	much	different	.
the	value	of	choice	 depend 	 s 	 	on	our	ability	to	perceive	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	between	the	 option 	 s 	 	.
americans	train	 the 	 ir 	 	whole	 live 	 s 	 	to	play	``	spot	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	.	``
they	practice	 th 	 is 	 	from	 s 	 uch 	 	an	early	age	that	they	've	come	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 every 	 one 	 	must	be	born	with	 th 	 is 	 	ability	.
in	fact	,	 th 	 ough 	 	all	 human 	 s 	 	share	a	 bas 	 ic 	 	need	and	 desir 	 e 	 	for	choice	,	we	do	n't	all	see	choice	in	the	same	 place 	 s 	 	or	to	the	same	 ex 	 tent 	 	.
when	 some 	 one 	 	ca	n't	see	how	one	choice	is	 un 	 like 	 	 an 	 other 	 	,	or	when	there	are	too	 man 	 y 	 	 choice 	 s 	 	to	 compar 	 e 	 	and	contrast	,	the	process	of	 choos 	 ing 	 	can	be	 con 	 fusing 	 	and	 frust 	 rating 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	making	better	 choice 	 s 	 	,	we	 be 	 come 	 	 overwhelm 	 ed 	 	by	choice	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	even	 af 	 raid 	 	of	it	.
choice	no	 long 	 er 	 	 off 	 ers 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	,	but	 impose 	 s 	 	 constraint 	 s 	 	.
it	's	not	a	marker	of	 liber 	 ation 	 	,	but	of	 suffoc 	 ation 	 	by	 meaning 	 less 	 	 min 	 utiae 	 	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	choice	can	develop	 in 	 to 	 	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 oppos 	 ite 	 	of	 every 	 thing 	 	it	 represent 	 s 	 	in	america	when	it	is	thrust	 up 	 on 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	who	are	 in 	 sufficient 	 ly 	 	prepared	for	it	.
but	it	is	not	 on 	 ly 	 	other	people	in	other	 place 	 s 	 	that	are	 feel 	 ing 	 	the	pressure	of	ever	-	increasing	choice	.
americans	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	are	 discover 	 ing 	 	that	 un 	 limit 	 ed 	 	choice	 seem 	 s 	 	more	 attract 	 ive 	 	in	 theor 	 y 	 	than	in	practice	.
we	all	have	physical	,	mental	and	 emotion 	 al 	 	 limit 	 ations 	 	that	make	it	 im 	 possible 	 	for	us	to	process	every	single	choice	we	 en 	 counter 	 	,	even	in	the	 grocer 	 y 	 	store	,	let	 al 	 one 	 	over	the	course	of	our	entire	 live 	 s 	 	.
a	number	of	my	 stud 	 ies 	 	have	 show 	 n 	 	that	when	you	give	people	10	or	more	 option 	 s 	 	when	they	're	making	a	choice	,	they	make	 poor 	 er 	 	 decision 	 s 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	be	health	care	,	 invest 	 ment 	 	,	other	critical	 area 	 s 	 	.
yet	still	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	us	 believ 	 e 	 	that	we	should	make	all	our	own	 choice 	 s 	 	and	seek	out	even	more	of	them	.
 th 	 is 	 	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	me	to	the	third	,	and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	most	 problem 	 atic 	 	,	assumption	:	``	you	must	never	say	no	to	choice	.	``	to	examine	 th 	 is 	 	,	let	's	go	back	to	the	u.s.	and	then	hop	 a 	 cross 	 	the	pond	to	france	.
right	 out 	 side 	 	chicago	,	a	young	couple	,	susan	and	daniel	mitchell	,	 we 	 re 	 	about	to	have	 the 	 ir 	 	first	baby	.
they	'd	 al 	 ready 	 	 pick 	 ed 	 	out	a	name	for	her	,	barbara	,	after	her	 grand 	 mother 	 	.
one	night	,	when	susan	was	seven	 month 	 s 	 	 pregn 	 ant 	 	,	she	 start 	 ed 	 	to	experience	 contract 	 ions 	 	and	was	 rush 	 ed 	 	to	the	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	room	.
the	baby	was	 deliver 	 ed 	 	through	a	c	-	section	,	but	barbara	 suffer 	 ed 	 	cerebral	 ano 	 xia 	 	,	a	loss	of	oxygen	to	the	brain	.
 un 	 able 	 	to	breathe	on	her	own	,	she	was	put	on	a	 ventil 	 ator 	 	.
two	 day 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	the	 doctor 	 s 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	the	mitchells	a	choice	:
they	could	either	 re 	 move 	 	barbara	off	the	life	support	,	in	which	case	she	would	die	 with 	 in 	 	a	matter	of	 hour 	 s 	 	,	or	they	could	keep	her	on	life	support	,	in	which	case	she	might	still	die	 with 	 in 	 	a	matter	of	 day 	 s 	 	.
if	she	 surviv 	 ed 	 	,	she	would	remain	in	a	permanent	 veget 	 ative 	 	state	,	never	able	to	walk	,	talk	or	interact	with	 other 	 s 	 	.
what	do	they	do	?
what	do	any	parent	do	?
in	a	 stud 	 y 	 	i	 conduct 	 ed 	 	with	simona	botti	and	kristina	orfali	,	american	and	french	 parent 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 interview 	 ed 	 	.
they	had	all	 suffer 	 ed 	 	the	same	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	.
in	all	 case 	 s 	 	,	the	life	support	was	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	,	and	the	 infant 	 s 	 	had	 di 	 ed 	 	.
but	there	was	a	big	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
in	france	,	the	 doctor 	 s 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	and	when	the	life	support	would	be	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	,	while	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	the	final	decision	 rest 	 ed 	 	with	the	 parent 	 s 	 	.
we	 wonder 	 ed 	 	:	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	have	an	effect	on	how	the	 parent 	 s 	 	cope	with	the	loss	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 love 	 d 	 	one	?
we	found	that	it	did	.
even	up	to	a	year	 lat 	 er 	 	,	american	 parent 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	express	negative	 emotion 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	french	 counter 	 part 	 s 	 	.
french	 parent 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	say	 thing 	 s 	 	like	,	``	noah	was	here	for	so	little	time	,	but	he	taught	us	so	much	.
he	 g 	 ave 	 	us	a	new	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	on	life	.	``	american	 parent 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	say	 thing 	 s 	 	like	,	``	what	if	?	what	if	?	``
 an 	 other 	 	parent	 complain 	 ed 	 	,	``	i	feel	 a 	 s 	 	if	they	 purpose 	 fully 	 	 torture 	 d 	 	me	.
how	did	they	get	me	to	do	that	?	``	and	 an 	 other 	 	parent	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	feel	 a 	 s 	 	if	i	've	 play 	 ed 	 	a	role	in	an	 exec 	 ution 	 	.	``	but	when	the	american	 parent 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	if	they	would	 ra 	 ther 	 	have	had	the	 doctor 	 s 	 	make	the	decision	,	they	all	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no.	``
they	could	not	imagine	 turn 	 ing 	 	that	choice	over	to	 an 	 other 	 	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	made	that	choice	made	them	feel	trapped	,	 guilt 	 y 	 	,	 ang 	 ry 	 	.
in	a	number	of	 case 	 s 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	even	 clinic 	 ally 	 	 depress 	 ed 	 	.
these	 parent 	 s 	 	could	not	 contempl 	 ate 	 	giving	up	the	choice	,	 be 	 cause 	 	to	do	so	would	have	gone	 contr 	 ary 	 	to	 every 	 thing 	 	they	had	 be 	 en 	 	taught	and	 every 	 thing 	 	they	had	come	to	 believ 	 e 	 	about	the	power	and	purpose	of	choice	.
in	her	essay	,	``	the	white	 al 	 bum 	 	,	``	joan	didion	 write 	 s 	 	,	``	we	tell	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	in	order	to	live	.
we	interpret	what	we	see	,	select	the	most	 work 	 able 	 	of	the	 multi 	 ple 	 	 choice 	 s 	 	.
we	live	 entire 	 ly 	 	by	the	 im 	 position 	 	of	a	narrative	line	 up 	 on 	 	disparate	 image 	 s 	 	,	by	the	idea	with	which	we	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	to	freeze	the	shifting	phantasmagoria	,	which	is	our	actual	experience	.	``	the	story	americans	tell	,	the	story	 up 	 on 	 	which	the	american	dream	 depend 	 s 	 	,	is	the	story	of	 limit 	 less 	 	choice	.
 th 	 is 	 	narrative	 promise 	 s 	 	so	much	:	 free 	 dom 	 	,	happiness	,	success	.
it	 lay 	 s 	 	the	world	at	your	feet	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	you	can	have	 any 	 thing 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	.	``
it	's	a	great	story	,	and	it	's	 understand 	 able 	 	why	they	would	be	 reluct 	 ant 	 	to	revise	it	.
but	when	you	take	a	close	look	,	you	start	to	see	the	 hole 	 s 	 	,	and	you	start	to	see	that	the	story	can	be	told	in	 man 	 y 	 	other	ways	.
americans	have	so	often	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	disseminate	 the 	 ir 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	of	choice	,	 believ 	 ing 	 	that	they	will	be	,	or	ought	to	be	,	 welcome 	 d 	 	with	open	 heart 	 s 	 	and	 mind 	 s 	 	.
but	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	 book 	 s 	 	and	the	 dai 	 ly 	 	news	tell	us	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	work	out	that	way	.
the	phantasmagoria	,	the	actual	experience	that	we	try	to	understand	and	organize	through	narrative	,	 varie 	 s 	 	from	place	to	place	.
no	single	narrative	 serve 	 s 	 	the	 need 	 s 	 	of	 every 	 one 	 	 every 	 where 	 	.
 more 	 over 	 	,	americans	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	could	benefit	from	 incorpo 	 rating 	 	new	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	narrative	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 driv 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 choice 	 s 	 	for	so	long	.
robert	frost	once	 s 	 aid 	 	that	,	``	it	is	 poet 	 ry 	 	that	is	lost	in	 transl 	 ation 	 	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	 suggest 	 s 	 	that	 what 	 ever 	 	is	 beaut 	 iful 	 	and	moving	,	 what 	 ever 	 	 give 	 s 	 	us	a	new	way	to	see	,	can	not	be	 communicate 	 d 	 	to	 t 	 hose 	 	who	speak	a	different	language	.
but	joseph	brodsky	 s 	 aid 	 	that	,	``	it	is	 poet 	 ry 	 	that	is	 gain 	 ed 	 	in	 transl 	 ation 	 	,	``	 suggest 	 ing 	 	that	 transl 	 ation 	 	can	be	a	creative	,	 transform 	 ative 	 	act	.
when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	choice	,	we	have	far	more	to	gain	than	to	lose	by	 engag 	 ing 	 	in	the	 man 	 y 	 	 transl 	 ations 	 	of	the	 narrative 	 s 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	 re 	 placing 	 	one	story	with	 an 	 other 	 	,	we	can	learn	from	and	revel	in	the	 man 	 y 	 	 version 	 s 	 	that	exist	and	the	 man 	 y 	 	that	have	yet	to	be	written	.
no	matter	where	we	're	from	and	what	your	narrative	is	,	we	all	have	a	 respons 	 ibility 	 	to	open	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	up	to	a	 wide 	 r 	 	array	of	what	choice	can	do	,	and	what	it	can	represent	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	not	lead	to	a	 para 	 ly 	 z 	 ing 	 	moral	 relat 	 ivism 	 	.
 ra 	 ther 	 	,	it	 teach 	 es 	 	us	when	and	how	to	act	.
it	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	us	that	much	 close 	 r 	 	to	 real 	 izing 	 	the	full	potential	of	choice	,	to	inspiring	the	hope	and	 achiev 	 ing 	 	the	 free 	 dom 	 	that	choice	 promise 	 s 	 	but	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	deliver	.
if	we	learn	to	speak	to	one	 an 	 other 	 	,	albeit	through	 transl 	 ation 	 	,	then	we	can	begin	to	see	choice	in	all	 it 	 s 	 	 strange 	 ness 	 	,	 complex 	 ity 	 	and	 compel 	 ling 	 	 beaut 	 y 	 	.
thank	you	.
bruno	giussani	:	thank	you	.
sheena	,	there	is	a	detail	about	your	 bio 	 graphy 	 	that	we	have	not	written	in	the	program	book	.
but	by	now	it	's	evident	to	 every 	 one 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	.	you	're	blind	.
and	i	guess	one	of	the	 question 	 s 	 	on	 every 	 body 	 	's	mind	is	:	how	 do 	 es 	 	that	influence	your	 stud 	 y 	 	of	 choos 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	an	activity	that	for	most	people	is	 associate 	 d 	 	with	visual	 in 	 put 	 s 	 	like	 aesthetic 	 s 	 	and	color	and	so	on	?
sheena	iyengar	:	well	,	it	's	funny	that	you	should	ask	that	 be 	 cause 	 	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	about	 be 	 ing 	 	blind	is	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	a	different	 van 	 t 	 age 	 	point	when	you	 observ 	 e 	 	the	way	 sight 	 ed 	 	people	make	 choice 	 s 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	just	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	,	there	's	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 choice 	 s 	 	out	there	that	are	 ver 	 y 	 	visual	these	 day 	 s 	 	.
 yea 	 h 	 	,	i	--	 a 	 s 	 	you	would	expect	--	get	 pre 	 tty 	 	 frust 	 rated 	 	by	 choice 	 s 	 	like	what	nail	polish	to	put	on	 be 	 cause 	 	i	have	to	 re 	 ly 	 	on	what	other	people	suggest	.
and	i	ca	n't	decide	.
and	so	one	time	i	was	in	a	 beaut 	 y 	 	 s 	 al 	 on 	 	,	and	i	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	decide	between	two	 ver 	 y 	 	light	 sha 	 de 	 s 	 	of	pink	.
and	one	was	 call 	 ed 	 	``	ballet	 slip 	 per 	 s 	 	.	``
and	the	other	one	was	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 ador 	 able 	 	.	``
and	so	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	these	two	 lad 	 ies 	 	,
and	the	one	 lad 	 y 	 	told	me	,	``	well	,	you	should	 definite 	 ly 	 	wear	'	ballet	 slip 	 per 	 s 	 	.	'	``
``	well	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	it	look	like	?	``
``	well	,	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	elegant	 sha 	 de 	 	of	pink	.	``
``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	great	.	``
the	other	 lad 	 y 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	me	to	wear	``	 ador 	 able 	 	.	``
``	what	 do 	 es 	 	it	look	like	?	``
``	it	's	a	 glamor 	 ous 	 	 sha 	 de 	 	of	pink	.	``
and	so	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	,	``	well	,	how	do	i	tell	them	 a 	 part 	 	?
what	's	different	about	them	?	``	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	one	is	elegant	,	the	other	one	's	 glamor 	 ous 	 	.	``
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	we	got	that	.
and	the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	they	had	 con 	 sens 	 us 	 	on	:	well	,	if	i	could	see	them	,	i	would	 clear 	 ly 	 	be	able	to	tell	them	 a 	 part 	 	.
and	what	i	 wonder 	 ed 	 	was	 whet 	 her 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 affect 	 ed 	 	by	the	name	or	the	content	of	the	color	,
so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	do	a	little	experiment	.
so	i	 br 	 ought 	 	these	two	 bottle 	 s 	 	of	nail	polish	 in 	 to 	 	the	 labor 	 atory 	 	,	and	i	 strip 	 ped 	 	the	 label 	 s 	 	off	.
and	i	 br 	 ought 	 	women	 in 	 to 	 	the	 labor 	 atory 	 	,	and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	,	``	which	one	would	you	pick	?	``
50	percent	of	the	women	 accus 	 ed 	 	me	of	 play 	 ing 	 	a	trick	,	of	 put 	 ting 	 	the	same	color	nail	polish	in	both	 t 	 hose 	 	 bottle 	 s 	 	.
at	which	point	you	start	to	wonder	who	the	trick	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 play 	 ed 	 	on	.
now	,	of	the	women	that	could	tell	them	 a 	 part 	 	,	when	the	 label 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	off	,	they	 pick 	 ed 	 	``	 ador 	 able 	 	,	``	and	when	the	 label 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	on	,	they	 pick 	 ed 	 	``	ballet	 slip 	 per 	 s 	 	.	``
so	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	i	can	tell	,	a	rose	by	any	other	name	 prob 	 ably 	 	 do 	 es 	 	look	different	and	 may 	 be 	 	even	 smell 	 s 	 	different	.
