metaphor	 live 	 s 	 	a	secret	life	all	around	us	.
we	utter	about	six	 metaphor 	 s 	 	a	minute	.
 metaphor 	 ical 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	is	essential	to	how	we	understand	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	 other 	 s 	 	,	how	we	communicate	,	learn	,	discover	and	invent	.
but	metaphor	is	a	way	of	thought	before	it	is	a	way	with	 word 	 s 	 	.
now	,	to	assist	me	in	 explain 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	've	 enlist 	 ed 	 	the	help	of	one	of	our	 great 	 est 	 	 philosoph 	 ers 	 	,	the	 reign 	 ing 	 	king	of	the	 metaphor 	 ians 	 	,	a	man	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 con 	 trib 	 ution 	 s 	 	to	the	field	are	so	great	that	he	 him 	 self 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	a	metaphor	.
i	am	,	of	course	,	 refer 	 ring 	 	to	 non 	 e 	 	other	than	elvis	presley	.
now	,	``	all	 s 	 hook 	 	up	``	is	a	great	love	song	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	great	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	how	 when 	 ever 	 	we	deal	with	 any 	 thing 	 	abstract	--	 idea 	 s 	 	,	 emotion 	 s 	 	,	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	,	 thought 	 s 	 	--	we	 inevit 	 ably 	 	resort	to	metaphor	.
in	``	all	 s 	 hook 	 	up	,	``	a	touch	is	not	a	touch	,	but	a	chill	.
lips	are	not	lips	,	but	 volcan 	 o 	 es 	 	.
she	is	not	she	,	but	a	 butter 	 cup 	 	.
and	love	is	not	love	,	but	 be 	 ing 	 	all	 s 	 hook 	 	up	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	,	elvis	is	 follow 	 ing 	 	aristotle	's	classic	definition	of	metaphor	 a 	 s 	 	the	process	of	giving	the	thing	a	name	that	 belong 	 s 	 	to	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 mathematic 	 s 	 	of	metaphor	.
and	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	.
x	 equal 	 s 	 	y	.
 th 	 is 	 	formula	 work 	 s 	 	 where 	 ver 	 	metaphor	is	present	.
elvis	uses	it	,	but	so	 do 	 es 	 	shakespeare	in	 th 	 is 	 	famous	line	from	``	romeo	and	juliet	:	``	juliet	is	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
now	,	here	,	shakespeare	 give 	 s 	 	the	thing	,	juliet	,	a	name	that	 belong 	 s 	 	to	 some 	 thing 	 	else	,	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
but	 when 	 ever 	 	we	give	a	thing	a	name	that	 belong 	 s 	 	to	 some 	 thing 	 	else	,	we	give	it	a	whole	network	of	 analog 	 ies 	 	too	.
we	mix	and	match	what	we	know	about	the	metaphor	's	source	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	with	what	we	know	about	 it 	 s 	 	target	,	juliet	.
and	metaphor	 give 	 s 	 	us	a	much	more	 vivi 	 d 	 	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	juliet	than	if	shakespeare	had	 liter 	 ally 	 	 de 	 scribed 	 	what	she	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
so	,	how	do	we	make	and	understand	 metaphor 	 s 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	might	look	familiar	.
the	first	step	is	pattern	 re 	 cognition 	 	.
look	at	 th 	 is 	 	image	.	what	do	you	see	?
three	 way 	 ward 	 	pac	-	men	,	and	three	 point 	 y 	 	brackets	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	present	.
what	we	see	,	 how 	 ever 	 	,	are	two	 over 	 lap 	 ping 	 	 triangle 	 s 	 	.
metaphor	is	not	just	the	 detect 	 ion 	 	of	 pattern 	 s 	 	;	it	is	the	creation	of	 pattern 	 s 	 	.
second	step	,	conceptual	 synest 	 hesia 	 	.
now	,	 synest 	 hesia 	 	is	the	experience	of	a	 stimul 	 us 	 	in	once	sense	organ	in	 an 	 other 	 	sense	organ	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 color 	 ed 	 	 hear 	 ing 	 	.
people	with	 color 	 ed 	 	 hear 	 ing 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	 color 	 s 	 	when	they	hear	the	 sound 	 s 	 	of	 word 	 s 	 	or	 letter 	 s 	 	.
we	all	have	 synest 	 hetic 	 	abilities	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	bouba	/	kiki	test	.
what	you	have	to	do	is	identify	which	of	these	 shape 	 s 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	bouba	,	and	which	is	 call 	 ed 	 	kiki	.
if	you	are	like	98	percent	of	other	people	,	you	will	identify	the	round	,	 amoeb 	 oid 	 	shape	 a 	 s 	 	bouba	,	and	the	sharp	,	 spi 	 ky 	 	one	 a 	 s 	 	kiki	.
can	we	do	a	quick	show	of	 hand 	 s 	 	?
 do 	 es 	 	that	correspond	?
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	i	think	99.9	would	about	cover	it	.
why	do	we	do	that	?
 be 	 cause 	 	we	 instinct 	 ively 	 	find	,	or	create	,	a	pattern	between	the	round	shape	and	the	round	sound	of	bouba	,	and	the	 spi 	 ky 	 	shape	and	the	 spi 	 ky 	 	sound	of	kiki	.
and	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 metaphor 	 s 	 	we	use	 every 	 day 	 	are	 synest 	 hetic 	 	.
silence	is	sweet	.
neckties	are	loud	.
 sexual 	 ly 	 	 attract 	 ive 	 	people	are	hot	.
 sexual 	 ly 	 	 un 	 attract 	 ive 	 	people	 leav 	 e 	 	us	cold	.
metaphor	 create 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	conceptual	 synest 	 hesia 	 	,	in	which	we	understand	one	 con 	 cept 	 	in	the	 con 	 text 	 	of	 an 	 other 	 	.
third	step	is	cognitive	dissonance	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	stroop	test	.
what	you	need	to	do	here	is	identify	 a 	 s 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	possible	the	color	of	the	ink	in	which	these	 word 	 s 	 	are	 print 	 ed 	 	.
you	can	take	the	test	now	.
if	you	're	like	most	people	,	you	will	experience	a	moment	of	cognitive	dissonance	when	the	name	of	the	color	is	 print 	 ed 	 	in	a	 different 	 ly 	 	 color 	 ed 	 	ink	.
the	test	 show 	 s 	 	that	we	can	not	 ignor 	 e 	 	the	 liter 	 al 	 	meaning	of	 word 	 s 	 	even	when	the	 liter 	 al 	 	meaning	 give 	 s 	 	the	wrong	answer	.
stroop	 test 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	with	metaphor	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
the	 particip 	 ants 	 	had	to	identify	,	 a 	 s 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	possible	,	the	 liter 	 ally 	 	false	 sentence 	 s 	 	.
they	took	 long 	 er 	 	to	reject	 metaphor 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	false	than	they	did	to	reject	 liter 	 ally 	 	false	 sentence 	 s 	 	.
why	?	 be 	 cause 	 	we	can	not	 ignor 	 e 	 	the	 metaphor 	 ical 	 	meaning	of	 word 	 s 	 	either	.	one	of	the	 sentence 	 s 	 	was	,	``	some	 job 	 s 	 	are	 jail 	 s 	 	.	``
now	,	 un 	 less 	 	you	're	a	 pri 	 son 	 	guard	,	the	sentence	``	some	 job 	 s 	 	are	 jail 	 s 	 	``	is	 liter 	 ally 	 	false	.
 s 	 ad 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	 metaphor 	 ically 	 	true	.
and	the	 metaphor 	 ical 	 	truth	 interfere 	 s 	 	with	our	ability	to	identify	it	 a 	 s 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	false	.
metaphor	 matter 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	around	us	every	day	,	all	the	time	.
metaphor	 matter 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 create 	 s 	 	 expect 	 ations 	 	.
pay	 care 	 ful 	 	attention	the	next	time	you	read	the	financial	news	.
agent	 metaphor 	 s 	 	 de 	 scribe 	 	price	 move 	 ments 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 de 	 liberate 	 	action	of	a	living	thing	,	 a 	 s 	 	in	,	``	the	nasdaq	 climb 	 ed 	 	 high 	 er 	 	.	``
object	 metaphor 	 s 	 	 de 	 scribe 	 	price	 move 	 ments 	 	 a 	 s 	 	non	-	living	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	in	,	``	the	dow	fell	like	a	brick	.	``
 research 	 ers 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	a	group	of	people	to	read	a	clutch	of	market	 comment 	 aries 	 	,	and	then	predict	the	next	day	's	price	trend	.
 t 	 hose 	 	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	to	agent	 metaphor 	 s 	 	had	 high 	 er 	 	 expect 	 ations 	 	that	price	 trend 	 s 	 	would	 continu 	 e 	 	.
and	they	had	 t 	 hose 	 	 expect 	 ations 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	agent	 metaphor 	 s 	 	 imp 	 ly 	 	the	 de 	 liberate 	 	action	of	a	living	thing	 pur 	 suing 	 	a	goal	.
if	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	house	 price 	 s 	 	are	 routine 	 ly 	 	 de 	 scribed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 climb 	 ing 	 	and	 climb 	 ing 	 	,	 high 	 er 	 	and	 high 	 er 	 	,	people	might	 natural 	 ly 	 	 assum 	 e 	 	that	that	rise	is	 un 	 stop 	 p 	 able 	 	.
they	may	feel	confident	,	say	,	in	taking	out	 mortgage 	 s 	 	they	 re 	 ally 	 	ca	n't	afford	.
that	's	a	hypothetical	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	course	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	metaphor	 mis 	 lead 	 s 	 	.
metaphor	 al 	 so 	 	 matter 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 influence 	 s 	 	 decision 	 s 	 	by	 activ 	 ating 	 	 analog 	 ies 	 	.
a	group	of	 student 	 s 	 	was	told	that	a	small	 democrat 	 ic 	 	country	had	 be 	 en 	 	 invad 	 ed 	 	and	had	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	u.s.	for	help	.
and	they	had	to	make	a	decision	.
what	should	they	do	?
 inter 	 vene 	 	,	appeal	to	the	u.n.	,	or	do	 noth 	 ing 	 	?
they	 we 	 re 	 	each	then	 give 	 n 	 	one	of	three	 de 	 script 	 ions 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	hypothetical	crisis	.
each	of	which	was	designed	to	trigger	a	different	 historic 	 al 	 	 analog 	 y 	 	:	world	war	ii	,	vietnam	,	and	the	third	was	 historic 	 ally 	 	neutral	.
 t 	 hose 	 	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	to	the	world	war	ii	scenario	made	more	 intervention 	 ist 	 	 recommend 	 ations 	 	than	the	 other 	 s 	 	.
just	 a 	 s 	 	we	can	not	 ignor 	 e 	 	the	 liter 	 al 	 	meaning	of	 word 	 s 	 	,	we	can	not	 ignor 	 e 	 	the	 analog 	 ies 	 	that	are	 trigger 	 ed 	 	by	metaphor	.
metaphor	 matter 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 open 	 s 	 	the	door	to	 discover 	 y 	 	.
 when 	 ever 	 	we	solve	a	problem	,	or	make	a	 discover 	 y 	 	,	we	 compar 	 e 	 	what	we	know	with	what	we	do	n't	know	.
and	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	to	find	out	about	the	 lat 	 ter 	 	is	to	investigate	the	ways	it	might	be	like	the	 form 	 er 	 	.
einstein	 de 	 scribed 	 	his	scientific	method	 a 	 s 	 	 comb 	 in 	 atory 	 	play	.
he	 famous 	 ly 	 	used	thought	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	which	are	 essential 	 ly 	 	elaborate	 analog 	 ies 	 	,	to	come	up	with	some	of	his	 great 	 est 	 	 discover 	 ies 	 	.
by	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	together	what	we	know	and	what	we	do	n't	know	through	 analog 	 y 	 	,	 metaphor 	 ical 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	 strike 	 s 	 	the	spark	that	 ignite 	 s 	 	 discover 	 y 	 	.
now	metaphor	is	 ubiqu 	 it 	 ous 	 	,	yet	it	's	 hid 	 den 	 	.
but	you	just	have	to	look	at	the	 word 	 s 	 	around	you	and	you	'll	find	it	.
ralph	waldo	emerson	 de 	 scribed 	 	language	 a 	 s 	 	``	fossil	 poet 	 ry 	 	.	``
but	before	it	was	fossil	 poet 	 ry 	 	language	was	fossil	metaphor	.
and	these	 fossil 	 s 	 	still	breathe	.
take	the	three	most	famous	 word 	 s 	 	in	all	of	western	 philosoph 	 y 	 	:	``	 cogit 	 o 	 	 er 	 go 	 	sum	.	``
that	's	 routine 	 ly 	 	 transl 	 ated 	 	 a 	 s 	 	,	``	i	think	,	 there 	 fore 	 	i	am.	``
but	there	is	a	better	 transl 	 ation 	 	.
the	latin	word	``	 cogit 	 o 	 	``	is	derived	from	the	 pre 	 fix 	 	``	co	,	``	meaning	``	together	,	``	and	the	verb	``	 agit 	 are 	 	,	``	meaning	``	to	shake	.	``
so	,	the	original	meaning	of	``	 cogit 	 o 	 	``	is	to	shake	together	.
and	the	proper	 transl 	 ation 	 	of	``	 cogit 	 o 	 	 er 	 go 	 	sum	``	is	``	i	shake	 thing 	 s 	 	up	,	 there 	 fore 	 	i	am.	``
metaphor	 shake 	 s 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	up	,	giving	us	 every 	 thing 	 	from	shakespeare	to	scientific	 discover 	 y 	 	in	the	process	.
the	mind	is	a	plastic	snow	 dom 	 e 	 	,	the	most	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	most	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	and	most	 it 	 self 	 	,	when	,	 a 	 s 	 	elvis	put	it	,	it	's	all	 s 	 hook 	 	up	.
and	metaphor	 keep 	 s 	 	the	mind	 sha 	 king 	 	,	 rat 	 tl 	 ing 	 	and	 roll 	 ing 	 	,	long	after	elvis	 ha 	 s 	 	left	the	building	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
