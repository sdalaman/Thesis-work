what	i	'd	like	to	start	off	with	is	an	 observ 	 ation 	 	,	which	is	that	if	i	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	over	the	last	year	,	it	's	that	the	 suprem 	 e 	 	 iron 	 y 	 	of	 publish 	 ing 	 	a	book	about	 s 	 low 	 ness 	 	is	that	you	have	to	go	around	promoting	it	 re 	 ally 	 	fast	.
i	seem	to	 s 	 pend 	 	most	of	my	time	these	 day 	 s 	 	 zip 	 ping 	 	from	city	to	city	,	studio	to	studio	,	interview	to	interview	,	 serv 	 ing 	 	up	the	book	in	 re 	 ally 	 	 tin 	 y 	 	bite	-	 s 	 ize 	 	 chunk 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 every 	 one 	 	these	 day 	 s 	 	 want 	 s 	 	to	know	how	to	 s 	 low 	 	down	,	but	they	want	to	know	how	to	 s 	 low 	 	down	 re 	 ally 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.	so	...
so	i	did	a	spot	on	cnn	the	other	day	where	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 pent 	 	more	time	in	 make 	 up 	 	than	i	did	 talk 	 ing 	 	on	air	.
and	i	think	that	--	that	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	surprising	 th 	 ough 	 	,	is	it	?
 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	kind	of	the	world	that	we	live	in	now	,	a	world	 s 	 tuck 	 	in	fast	-	forward	.
a	world	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	speed	,	with	 do 	 ing 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	,	with	 cram 	 ming 	 	more	and	more	 in 	 to 	 	less	and	less	time	.
every	moment	of	the	day	 feel 	 s 	 	like	a	race	against	the	clock	.
to	borrow	a	phrase	from	carrie	 fish 	 er 	 	,	which	is	in	my	bio	there	;	i	'll	just	 to 	 s 	 s 	 	it	out	 aga 	 in 	 	--	``	these	 day 	 s 	 	even	instant	 grat 	 ification 	 	 take 	 s 	 	too	long	.	``
and	if	you	think	about	how	we	to	try	to	make	 thing 	 s 	 	better	,	what	do	we	do	?
no	,	we	speed	them	up	,	do	n't	we	?	so	we	used	to	dial	;	now	we	speed	dial	.
we	used	to	read	;	now	we	speed	read	.	we	used	to	walk	;	now	we	speed	walk	.
and	of	course	,	we	used	to	date	and	now	we	speed	date	.
and	even	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	by	 the 	 ir 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	nature	 s 	 low 	 	--	we	try	and	speed	them	up	too	.	so	i	was	in	new	york	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	and	i	 walk 	 ed 	 	past	a	gym	that	had	an	 advertise 	 ment 	 	in	the	window	for	a	new	course	,	a	new	 even 	 ing 	 	course	.
and	it	was	for	,	you	 guess 	 ed 	 	it	,	speed	 y 	 oga 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	--	the	perfect	solution	for	time	-	 starv 	 ed 	 	 professional 	 s 	 	who	want	to	,	you	know	,	 salut 	 e 	 	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	but	 on 	 ly 	 	want	to	give	over	about	20	 minute 	 s 	 	to	it	.
i	mean	,	these	are	sort	of	the	 extrem 	 e 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	,	and	they	're	 am 	 using 	 	and	good	to	laugh	at	.
but	there	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	serious	point	,	and	i	think	that	in	the	 head 	 long 	 	dash	of	 dai 	 ly 	 	life	,	we	often	lose	sight	of	the	damage	that	 th 	 is 	 	 road 	 runner 	 	form	of	living	 do 	 es 	 	to	us	.
we	're	so	 marin 	 ated 	 	in	the	culture	of	speed	that	we	 al 	 most 	 	fail	to	notice	the	toll	it	 take 	 s 	 	on	every	 a 	 spect 	 	of	our	 live 	 s 	 	--
on	our	health	,	our	diet	,	our	work	,	our	 relationship 	 s 	 	,	the	environment	and	our	community	.
and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	it	 take 	 s 	 	a	wake	-	up	call	,	 do 	 es 	 	n't	it	,	to	alert	us	to	the	fact	that	we	're	 hur 	 ry 	 ing 	 	through	our	 live 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 actual 	 ly 	 	living	them	;	that	we	're	living	the	fast	life	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	the	good	life	.
and	i	think	for	 man 	 y 	 	people	,	that	wake	-	up	call	 take 	 s 	 	the	form	of	an	 ill 	 ness 	 	.
you	know	,	a	 burn 	 out 	 	,	or	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	the	body	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	ca	n't	take	it	 any 	 more 	 	,	``	and	 throw 	 s 	 	in	the	 to 	 wel 	 	.
or	 may 	 be 	 	a	relationship	 go 	 es 	 	up	in	smoke	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	n't	had	the	time	,	or	the	patience	,	or	the	 tranquil 	 ity 	 	,	to	be	with	the	other	person	,	to	listen	to	them	.
and	my	wake	-	up	call	came	when	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 read 	 ing 	 	 bed 	 time 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	to	my	son	,	and	i	found	that	at	the	end	of	day	,	i	would	go	 in 	 to 	 	his	room	and	i	just	could	n't	 s 	 low 	 	down	--	you	know	,	i	'd	be	speed	 read 	 ing 	 	``	the	cat	in	the	hat	.	``
i	'd	be	--	you	know	,	i	'd	be	 skip 	 ping 	 	lines	here	,	 para 	 graph 	 s 	 	there	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	a	whole	page	,	and	of	course	,	my	little	boy	 k 	 new 	 	the	book	 in 	 side 	 	out	,	so	we	would	 quar 	 rel 	 	.
and	what	should	have	 be 	 en 	 	the	most	 relax 	 ing 	 	,	the	most	 intima 	 te 	 	,	the	most	tender	moment	of	the	day	,	when	a	dad	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	down	to	read	to	his	son	,	 be 	 came 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 glad 	 iat 	 orial 	 	battle	of	 will 	 s 	 	,	a	 c 	 lash 	 	between	my	speed	and	his	 s 	 low 	 ness 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	went	on	for	some	time	,	 un 	 til 	 	i	caught	 my 	 self 	 	 s 	 canning 	 	a	 news 	 paper 	 	article	with	 time 	 saving 	 	 tip 	 s 	 	for	fast	people	.
and	one	of	them	made	 re 	 ference 	 	to	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 book 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	one	-	minute	 bed 	 time 	 	story	.	``
and	i	 win 	 ce 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 word 	 s 	 	now	,	but	my	first	 re 	 action 	 	at	the	time	was	 ver 	 y 	 	different	.
my	first	 re 	 flex 	 	was	to	say	,	``	hallelujah	--	what	a	great	idea	!
 th 	 is 	 	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	i	'm	looking	for	to	speed	up	 bed 	 time 	 	even	more	.	``
but	 thank 	 fully 	 	,	a	light	bulb	went	on	over	my	head	,	and	my	next	 re 	 action 	 	was	 ver 	 y 	 	different	,	and	i	took	a	step	back	,	and	i	thought	,	``	 who 	 a 	 	--	you	know	,	 ha 	 s 	 	it	 re 	 ally 	 	come	to	 th 	 is 	 	?
am	i	 re 	 ally 	 	in	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 hur 	 ry 	 	that	i	'm	prepared	to	 f 	 ob 	 	off	my	son	with	a	sound	byte	at	the	end	of	the	day	?	``
and	i	put	away	the	 news 	 paper 	 	--	and	i	was	 get 	 ting 	 	on	a	plane	--	and	i	 s 	 at 	 	there	,	and	i	did	 some 	 thing 	 	i	had	n't	 d 	 one 	 	for	a	long	time	--	which	is	i	did	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
i	just	thought	,	and	i	thought	long	and	hard	.
and	by	the	time	i	got	off	that	plane	,	i	'd	 decide 	 d 	 	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	it	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	investigate	 th 	 is 	 	whole	 road 	 runner 	 	culture	,	and	what	it	was	 do 	 ing 	 	to	me	and	to	 every 	 one 	 	else	.	and	i	had	two	 question 	 s 	 	in	my	head	.
the	first	was	,	how	did	we	get	so	fast	?
and	the	second	is	,	is	it	possible	,	or	even	 desir 	 able 	 	,	to	 s 	 low 	 	down	?
now	,	if	you	think	about	how	our	world	got	so	 accele 	 rated 	 	,	the	usual	 suspect 	 s 	 	rear	 the 	 ir 	 	 head 	 s 	 	.
you	think	of	,	you	know	,	 urban 	 ization 	 	,	 consumer 	 ism 	 	,	the	 work 	 place 	 	,	technology	.
but	i	think	if	you	cut	through	 t 	 hose 	 	 force 	 s 	 	,	you	get	to	what	might	be	the	 deep 	 er 	 	driver	,	the	nub	of	the	question	,	which	is	how	we	think	about	time	 it 	 self 	 	.
in	other	 culture 	 s 	 	,	time	is	 cycl 	 ical 	 	.
it	's	 s 	 een 	 	 a 	 s 	 	moving	in	great	,	 un 	 hurried 	 	 circle 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 al 	 ways 	 	 renew 	 ing 	 	and	 re 	 fresh 	 ing 	 	 it 	 self 	 	.
 where 	 a 	 s 	 	in	the	west	,	time	is	linear	.
it	's	a	 fin 	 ite 	 	resource	;	it	's	 al 	 ways 	 	 drain 	 ing 	 	away	.
you	either	use	it	,	or	lose	it	.
``	time	is	money	,	``	 a 	 s 	 	benjamin	franklin	 s 	 aid 	 	.
and	i	think	what	that	 do 	 es 	 	to	us	 psycho 	 logically 	 	is	it	 create 	 s 	 	an	 equ 	 ation 	 	.
time	is	scarce	,	so	what	do	we	do	?
well	--	well	,	we	speed	up	,	do	n't	we	?
we	try	and	do	more	and	more	with	less	and	less	time	.
we	turn	every	moment	of	every	day	 in 	 to 	 	a	race	to	the	finish	line	--
a	finish	line	,	 incident 	 ally 	 	,	that	we	never	reach	,	but	a	finish	line	 non 	 e 	 the 	 less 	 	.
and	i	guess	that	the	question	is	,	is	it	possible	to	break	free	from	that	 mind 	 set 	 	?
and	 thank 	 fully 	 	,	the	answer	is	 y 	 es 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	what	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	,	when	i	 beg 	 an 	 	looking	around	,	that	there	is	a	global	 back 	 lash 	 	against	 th 	 is 	 	culture	that	 tell 	 s 	 	us	that	 fast 	 er 	 	is	 al 	 ways 	 	better	,	and	that	 bus 	 ier 	 	is	best	.
right	 a 	 cross 	 	the	world	,	people	are	 do 	 ing 	 	the	 un 	 think 	 able 	 	:	they	're	 s 	 low 	 ing 	 	down	,	and	 find 	 ing 	 	that	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	 convention 	 al 	 	 wis 	 dom 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	you	that	if	you	 s 	 low 	 	down	,	you	're	road	kill	,	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	be	true	:
that	by	 s 	 low 	 ing 	 	down	at	the	right	 moment 	 s 	 	,	people	find	that	they	do	 every 	 thing 	 	better	.
they	eat	better	;	they	make	love	better	;	they	 exercis 	 e 	 	better	;	they	work	better	;	they	live	better	.
and	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	cauldron	of	 moment 	 s 	 	and	 place 	 s 	 	and	 act 	 s 	 	of	 decele 	 ration 	 	,	lie	what	a	lot	of	people	now	refer	to	 a 	 s 	 	the	``	 inter 	 national 	 	 s 	 low 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	.	``
now	if	you	'll	permit	me	a	small	act	of	 hypo 	 cri 	 s 	 y 	 	,	i	'll	just	give	you	a	 ver 	 y 	 	quick	 over 	 view 	 	of	what	's	going	on	 in 	 side 	 	the	 s 	 low 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	.	if	you	think	of	food	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	will	have	heard	of	the	 s 	 low 	 	food	 move 	 ment 	 	.

and	it	's	driven	by	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	and	 sens 	 ible 	 	 mess 	 age 	 	,	which	is	that	we	get	more	pleasure	and	more	health	from	our	food	when	we	 cultiv 	 ate 	 	,	cook	and	 consum 	 e 	 	it	at	a	 reason 	 able 	 	pace	.
i	think	 al 	 so 	 	the	explosion	of	the	 organ 	 ic 	 	 farm 	 ing 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	,	and	the	 ren 	 aiss 	 ance 	 	of	 farm 	 ers 	 	'	 market 	 s 	 	,	are	other	 illustr 	 ations 	 	of	the	fact	that	people	are	desperate	to	get	away	from	eating	and	 cook 	 ing 	 	and	 cultiv 	 ating 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	food	on	an	industrial	 time 	 table 	 	.
they	want	to	get	back	to	 s 	 lower 	 	 rhythm 	 s 	 	.
and	out	of	the	 s 	 low 	 	food	 move 	 ment 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	grown	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 s 	 low 	 	cities	 move 	 ment 	 	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	in	italy	,	but	 ha 	 s 	 	spread	right	 a 	 cross 	 	europe	and	beyond	.
and	in	 th 	 is 	 	,	 town 	 s 	 	begin	to	 re 	 think 	 	how	they	organize	the	urban	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	,	so	that	people	are	 encourag 	 ed 	 	to	 s 	 low 	 	down	and	smell	the	 rose 	 s 	 	and	connect	with	one	 an 	 other 	 	.
so	they	might	 cur 	 b 	 	traffic	,	or	put	in	a	park	bench	,	or	some	green	space	.
and	in	some	ways	,	these	 change 	 s 	 	add	up	to	more	than	the	sum	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 part 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	when	a	 s 	 low 	 	city	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 official 	 ly 	 	a	 s 	 low 	 	city	,	it	's	kind	of	like	a	 philosoph 	 ical 	 	 decla 	 ration 	 	.
it	's	 say 	 ing 	 	to	the	rest	of	world	,	and	to	the	people	in	that	town	,	that	we	 believ 	 e 	 	that	in	the	21st	century	,	 s 	 low 	 ness 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	role	to	play	.
in	medicine	,	i	think	a	lot	of	people	are	 deep 	 ly 	 	 dis 	 illusion 	 ed 	 	with	the	kind	of	quick	-	fix	 ment 	 ality 	 	you	find	in	 convention 	 al 	 	medicine	.
and	 million 	 s 	 	of	them	around	the	world	are	 turn 	 ing 	 	to	 comple 	 ment 	 ary 	 	and	 alter 	 native 	 	 form 	 s 	 	of	medicine	,	which	tend	to	tap	 in 	 to 	 	sort	of	 s 	 lower 	 	,	 gentle 	 r 	 	,	more	 hol 	 istic 	 	 form 	 s 	 	of	 heal 	 ing 	 	.
now	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	the	jury	is	out	on	 man 	 y 	 	of	these	 comple 	 ment 	 ary 	 	 ther 	 a 	 pies 	 	,	and	i	 personal 	 ly 	 	doubt	that	the	coffee	 ene 	 ma 	 	will	ever	,	you	know	,	gain	 main 	 stream 	 	approval	.
but	other	 treat 	 ments 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 acu 	 punctu 	 re 	 	and	 mass 	 age 	 	,	and	even	just	 relax 	 ation 	 	,	 clear 	 ly 	 	have	some	kind	of	benefit	.

 s 	 ex 	 	.	there	's	an	awful	lot	of	fast	 s 	 ex 	 	around	,	is	n't	there	?
i	was	coming	to	--	well	--	no	pun	 intend 	 ed 	 	there	.
i	was	making	my	way	,	let	's	say	,	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	to	oxford	,	and	i	went	through	a	news	agent	,	and	i	saw	a	magazine	,	a	men	's	magazine	,	and	it	 s 	 aid 	 	on	the	front	,	``	how	to	 br 	 ing 	 	your	partner	to	orgasm	in	30	 second 	 s 	 	.	``
so	,	you	know	,	even	 s 	 ex 	 	is	on	a	 stop 	 watch 	 	these	 day 	 s 	 	.
now	,	you	know	,	i	like	a	 quick 	 ie 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	the	next	person	,	but	i	think	that	there	's	an	awful	lot	to	be	 gain 	 ed 	 	from	 s 	 low 	 	 s 	 ex 	 	--	from	 s 	 low 	 ing 	 	down	in	the	 bed 	 room 	 	.
you	know	,	you	tap	 in 	 to 	 	that	--	 t 	 hose 	 	 deep 	 er 	 	,	sort	of	,	 psycho 	 logical 	 	,	 emotion 	 al 	 	,	spiritual	 current 	 s 	 	,	and	you	get	a	better	orgasm	with	the	 build 	 up 	 	.
you	can	get	more	bang	for	your	buck	,	let	's	say	.
i	mean	,	the	 point 	 er 	 	 sister 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	it	most	 eloquent 	 ly 	 	,	did	n't	they	,	when	they	 s 	 ang 	 	the	 praise 	 s 	 	of	``	a	lover	with	a	 s 	 low 	 	hand	.	``
now	,	we	all	 laugh 	 ed 	 	at	 s 	 ting 	 	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	when	he	went	tantric	,	but	you	fast	-	forward	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	now	you	find	 couple 	 s 	 	of	all	 age 	 s 	 	 flock 	 ing 	 	to	 work 	 shop 	 s 	 	,	or	 may 	 be 	 	just	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 bed 	 rooms 	 	,	 find 	 ing 	 	ways	to	put	on	the	 brake 	 s 	 	and	have	better	 s 	 ex 	 	.
and	of	course	,	in	italy	where	--	i	mean	,	italians	 al 	 ways 	 	seem	to	know	where	to	find	 the 	 ir 	 	pleasure	--	they	've	 launch 	 ed 	 	an	official	 s 	 low 	 	 s 	 ex 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	.
the	 work 	 place 	 	.	right	 a 	 cross 	 	much	of	the	world	--	north	america	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 not 	 able 	 	exception	--	 work 	 ing 	 	 hour 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	coming	down	.
and	europe	is	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	that	,	and	people	 find 	 ing 	 	that	 the 	 ir 	 	quality	of	life	 improve 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	're	 work 	 ing 	 	less	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	that	 the 	 ir 	 	 hour 	 ly 	 	 product 	 ivity 	 	 go 	 es 	 	up	.
now	,	 clear 	 ly 	 	there	are	 problem 	 s 	 	with	the	35	-	hour	 work 	 week 	 	in	france	--	too	much	,	too	soon	,	too	rigid	.
but	other	 count 	 ries 	 	in	europe	,	 not 	 ably 	 	the	nordic	 count 	 ries 	 	,	are	 show 	 ing 	 	that	it	's	possible	to	have	a	kick	-	ass	 eco 	 nomy 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 work 	 aholic 	 	.
and	norway	,	sweden	,	denmark	and	finland	now	rank	among	the	top	six	most	competitive	 nation 	 s 	 	on	earth	,	and	they	work	the	kind	of	 hour 	 s 	 	that	would	make	the	average	american	weep	with	 en 	 vy 	 	.
and	if	you	go	beyond	sort	of	the	country	level	,	down	at	the	micro	-	company	level	,	more	and	more	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	now	are	 real 	 izing 	 	that	they	need	to	allow	 the 	 ir 	 	staff	either	to	work	 few 	 er 	 	 hour 	 s 	 	or	just	to	 un 	 plug 	 	--	to	take	a	lunch	break	,	or	to	go	 s 	 it 	 	in	a	quiet	room	,	to	 s 	 witch 	 	off	 the 	 ir 	 	blackberrys	and	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	--	you	at	the	back	--	mobile	 phone 	 s 	 	,	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	work	day	or	on	the	 week 	 end 	 	,	so	that	they	have	time	to	 re 	 charge 	 	and	for	the	brain	to	slide	 in 	 to 	 	that	kind	of	creative	mode	of	thought	.
it	's	not	just	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	these	 day 	 s 	 	,	 adult 	 s 	 	who	 over 	 work 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	is	it	?	it	's	children	,	too	.
i	'm	37	,	and	my	 child 	 hood 	 	 end 	 ed 	 	in	the	mid	-	'80s	,	and	i	look	at	 kid 	 s 	 	now	,	and	i	'm	just	 amaz 	 ed 	 	by	the	way	they	race	around	with	more	 home 	 work 	 	,	more	 tutor 	 ing 	 	,	more	 extracurricular 	 s 	 	than	we	would	ever	have	 conceiv 	 ed 	 	of	a	generation	ago	.
and	some	of	the	most	 heart 	 rend 	 ing 	 	 email 	 s 	 	that	i	get	on	my	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	from	 adolescent 	 s 	 	 hover 	 ing 	 	on	the	edge	of	 burn 	 out 	 	,	 plead 	 ing 	 	with	me	to	write	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	,	to	help	them	 s 	 low 	 	down	,	to	help	them	get	off	 th 	 is 	 	full	-	throttle	 tread 	 mill 	 	.
but	 thank 	 fully 	 	,	there	is	a	 back 	 lash 	 	there	in	 parent 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	and	you	're	 find 	 ing 	 	that	,	you	know	,	 town 	 s 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	are	now	 band 	 ing 	 	together	and	 bann 	 ing 	 	 extracurricular 	 s 	 	on	a	 part 	 icular 	 	day	of	the	month	,	so	that	people	can	,	you	know	,	 de 	 compress 	 	and	have	some	family	time	,	and	 s 	 low 	 	down	.
 home 	 work 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	thing	.	there	are	 home 	 work 	 	 ban 	 s 	 	 spring 	 ing 	 	up	all	over	the	 develop 	 ed 	 	world	in	 school 	 s 	 	which	had	 be 	 en 	 	 pil 	 ing 	 	on	the	 home 	 work 	 	for	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	now	they	're	 discover 	 ing 	 	that	less	can	be	more	.
so	there	was	a	case	up	in	scotland	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	where	a	fee	-	 pay 	 ing 	 	,	high	-	 achiev 	 ing 	 	private	school	 bann 	 ed 	 	 home 	 work 	 	for	 every 	 one 	 	under	the	age	of	13	,	and	the	high	-	 achiev 	 ing 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	 freak 	 ed 	 	out	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	are	you	--	you	know	,	our	 kid 	 s 	 	will	fall	``	--	the	 head 	 master 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	no	,	your	children	need	to	 s 	 low 	 	down	at	the	end	of	the	day	.	``
and	just	 th 	 is 	 	last	month	,	the	 ex 	 am 	 	 result 	 s 	 	came	in	,	and	in	math	,	science	,	 mark 	 s 	 	went	up	20	percent	on	average	last	year	.
and	i	think	what	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 reveal 	 ing 	 	is	that	the	elite	 un 	 ive 	 rs 	 ities 	 	,	who	are	often	 cit 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	reason	that	people	drive	 the 	 ir 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	and	 hot 	 house 	 	them	so	much	,	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	notice	the	 calib 	 er 	 	of	 student 	 s 	 	coming	to	them	is	 fall 	 ing 	 	.	these	 kid 	 s 	 	have	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 mark 	 s 	 	;	they	have	cvs	 jamm 	 ed 	 	with	 extracurricular 	 s 	 	,	to	the	point	that	would	make	your	 eye 	 s 	 	water	.
but	they	lack	spark	;	they	lack	the	ability	to	think	 creative 	 ly 	 	and	think	 out 	 side 	 	--	they	do	n't	know	how	to	dream	.	and	so	what	these	 iv 	 y 	 	league	 school 	 s 	 	,	and	oxford	and	cambridge	and	so	on	,	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	 s 	 end 	 	a	 mess 	 age 	 	to	 parent 	 s 	 	and	 student 	 s 	 	that	they	need	to	put	on	the	 brake 	 s 	 	a	little	bit	.
and	in	harvard	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	they	 s 	 end 	 	out	a	letter	to	 under 	 graduate 	 s 	 	--	 fresh 	 men 	 	--	 tell 	 ing 	 	them	that	they	'll	get	more	out	of	life	,	and	more	out	of	harvard	,	if	they	put	on	the	 brake 	 s 	 	,	if	they	do	less	,	but	give	time	to	 thing 	 s 	 	,	the	time	that	 thing 	 s 	 	need	,	to	enjoy	them	,	to	savor	them	.
and	even	if	they	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	do	 noth 	 ing 	 	at	all	.
and	that	letter	is	 call 	 ed 	 	--	 ver 	 y 	 	 reveal 	 ing 	 	,	i	think	--	``	 s 	 low 	 	down	!	``	--	with	an	 ex 	 clam 	 ation 	 	mark	on	the	end	.
so	 where 	 ver 	 	you	look	,	the	 mess 	 age 	 	,	it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	,	is	the	same	:
that	less	is	 ver 	 y 	 	often	more	,	that	 s 	 lower 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	often	better	.	but	that	 s 	 aid 	 	,	of	course	,	it	's	not	that	easy	to	 s 	 low 	 	down	,	is	it	?
i	mean	,	you	heard	that	i	got	a	 speed 	 ing 	 	ticket	while	i	was	 research 	 ing 	 	my	book	on	the	 benefit 	 s 	 	of	 s 	 low 	 ness 	 	,	and	that	's	true	,	but	that	's	not	all	of	it	.
i	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	en	route	to	a	 d 	 inner 	 	held	by	 s 	 low 	 	food	at	the	time	.
and	if	that	's	not	 s 	 ham 	 ing 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	i	got	that	ticket	in	italy	.
and	if	any	of	you	have	ever	driven	on	an	italian	 high 	 way 	 	,	you	'll	have	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	idea	of	how	fast	i	was	going	.
but	why	is	it	so	hard	to	 s 	 low 	 	down	?
i	think	there	are	 vari 	 ous 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	.
one	is	that	speed	is	 f 	 un 	 	,	you	know	,	speed	is	sexy	.
it	's	all	that	 adrenalin 	 e 	 	rush	.	it	's	hard	to	give	it	up	.
i	think	there	's	a	kind	of	 meta 	 physical 	 	dimension	--	that	speed	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	way	of	 wall 	 ing 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	off	from	the	 big 	 ger 	 	,	 deep 	 er 	 	 question 	 s 	 	.
we	fill	our	head	with	 distract 	 ion 	 	,	with	 bus 	 y 	 ness 	 	,	so	that	we	do	n't	have	to	ask	,	am	i	well	?	am	i	happy	?	are	my	children	growing	up	right	?
are	 politic 	 ians 	 	making	good	 decision 	 s 	 	on	my	 be 	 half 	 	?
 an 	 other 	 	reason	--	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	i	think	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	the	most	 power 	 ful 	 	reason	--	why	we	find	it	hard	to	 s 	 low 	 	down	is	the	cultural	taboo	that	we	've	 erect 	 ed 	 	against	 s 	 low 	 ing 	 	down	.
``	 s 	 low 	 	``	is	a	 dirt 	 y 	 	word	in	our	culture	.
it	's	a	 by 	 word 	 	for	``	 laz 	 y 	 	,	``	``	 s 	 lack 	 er 	 	,	``	for	 be 	 ing 	 	 some 	 body 	 	who	 give 	 s 	 	up	.
you	know	,	``	he	's	a	bit	 s 	 low 	 	.	``	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	synonymous	with	 be 	 ing 	 	stupid	.
i	guess	what	the	 s 	 low 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	--	the	purpose	of	the	 s 	 low 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	,	or	 it 	 s 	 	main	goal	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	is	to	tackle	that	taboo	,	and	to	say	that	 y 	 es 	 	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 s 	 low 	 	is	not	the	answer	,	that	there	is	 s 	 uch 	 	a	thing	 a 	 s 	 	``	bad	 s 	 low 	 	.	``
you	know	,	i	got	 s 	 tuck 	 	on	the	m	25	,	which	is	a	ring	road	around	london	,	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	and	 s 	 pent 	 	three	-	and	-	a	-	half	 hour 	 s 	 	there	.	and	i	can	tell	you	,	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	 s 	 low 	 	.
but	the	new	idea	,	the	sort	of	 revolution 	 ary 	 	idea	,	of	the	 s 	 low 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	,	is	that	there	is	 s 	 uch 	 	a	thing	 a 	 s 	 	``	good	 s 	 low 	 	,	``	too	.
and	good	 s 	 low 	 	is	,	you	know	,	taking	the	time	to	eat	a	meal	with	your	family	,	with	the	tv	 s 	 witch 	 ed 	 	off	.
or	taking	the	time	to	look	at	a	problem	from	all	 angle 	 s 	 	in	the	 off 	 ice 	 	to	make	the	best	decision	at	work	.
or	even	 simpl 	 y 	 	just	taking	the	time	to	 s 	 low 	 	down	and	savor	your	life	.
now	,	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	found	most	 up 	 lift 	 ing 	 	about	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	that	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	around	the	book	since	it	came	out	,	is	the	 re 	 action 	 	to	it	.
and	i	 k 	 new 	 	that	when	my	book	on	 s 	 low 	 ness 	 	came	out	,	it	would	be	 welcome 	 d 	 	by	the	new	age	brigade	,	but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 en 	 	taken	up	,	with	great	 gust 	 o 	 	,	by	the	corporate	world	--	you	know	,	business	press	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	big	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	and	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	people	at	the	top	of	the	chain	,	people	like	you	,	i	think	,	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	there	's	too	much	speed	in	the	system	,	there	's	too	much	 bus 	 y 	 ness 	 	,	and	it	's	time	to	find	,	or	get	back	to	that	lost	art	of	shifting	 gear 	 s 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	 encourag 	 ing 	 	sign	,	i	think	,	is	that	it	's	not	just	in	the	 develop 	 ed 	 	world	that	 th 	 is 	 	idea	's	 be 	 en 	 	taken	up	.	in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	,	in	 count 	 ries 	 	that	are	on	the	 ver 	 ge 	 	of	making	that	leap	 in 	 to 	 	first	world	 stat 	 us 	 	--	 chin 	 a 	 	,	brazil	,	thailand	,	poland	,	and	so	on	--	these	 count 	 ries 	 	have	 embrace 	 d 	 	the	idea	of	the	 s 	 low 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	people	in	them	,	and	there	's	a	debate	going	on	in	 the 	 ir 	 	media	,	on	the	 street 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	they	're	looking	at	the	west	,	and	they	're	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	well	,	we	like	that	 a 	 spect 	 	of	what	you	've	got	,	but	we	're	not	so	 s 	 ure 	 	about	that	.	``
so	all	of	that	 s 	 aid 	 	,	is	it	,	i	guess	,	is	it	possible	?
that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	the	main	question	before	us	 to 	 day 	 	.	is	it	possible	to	 s 	 low 	 	down	?	and	i	'm	happy	to	be	able	to	say	to	you	that	the	answer	is	a	 re 	 sound 	 ing 	 	 y 	 es 	 	.
and	i	present	 my 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	exhibit	a	,	a	kind	of	 reform 	 ed 	 	and	 rehabilit 	 ated 	 	speed	-	aholic	.
i	still	love	speed	.	you	know	,	i	live	in	london	,	and	i	work	 a 	 s 	 	a	journalist	,	and	i	enjoy	the	buzz	and	the	 bus 	 y 	 ness 	 	,	and	the	 adrenalin 	 e 	 	rush	that	 come 	 s 	 	from	both	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
i	play	squash	and	ice	 hoc 	 key 	 	,	two	 ver 	 y 	 	fast	 s 	 port 	 s 	 	,	and	i	would	n't	give	them	up	for	the	world	.
but	i	've	 al 	 so 	 	,	over	the	last	year	or	so	,	got	in	touch	with	my	inner	tortoise	.
and	what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	is	that	i	no	 long 	 er 	 	 over 	 load 	 	 my 	 self 	 	 gratuitous 	 ly 	 	.
my	default	mode	is	no	 long 	 er 	 	to	be	a	rush	-	aholic	.
i	no	 long 	 er 	 	hear	time	's	 wing 	 ed 	 	 cha 	 riot 	 	 draw 	 ing 	 	near	,	or	at	 l 	 east 	 	not	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	i	did	before	.
i	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	hear	it	now	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	see	my	time	is	 tick 	 ing 	 	off	.
and	the	 up 	 shot 	 	of	all	of	that	is	that	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	feel	a	lot	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	,	 health 	 ier 	 	,	more	productive	than	i	ever	have	.
i	feel	like	i	'm	living	my	life	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 actual 	 ly 	 	just	 rac 	 ing 	 	through	it	.
and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	measure	of	the	success	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	i	feel	that	my	 relationship 	 s 	 	are	a	lot	 deep 	 er 	 	,	 rich 	 er 	 	,	 strong 	 er 	 	.
and	for	me	,	i	guess	,	the	 lit 	 mus 	 	test	for	 whet 	 her 	 	 th 	 is 	 	would	work	,	and	what	it	would	mean	,	was	 al 	 ways 	 	going	to	be	 bed 	 time 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	sort	of	where	the	journey	 beg 	 an 	 	.	and	there	too	the	news	is	 ros 	 y 	 	.	you	know	,	at	the	end	of	the	day	,	i	go	 in 	 to 	 	my	son	's	room	.
i	do	n't	wear	a	watch	.	i	 s 	 witch 	 	off	my	computer	,	so	i	ca	n't	hear	the	email	 ping 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	basket	,	and	i	just	 s 	 low 	 	down	to	his	pace	and	we	read	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	children	have	 the 	 ir 	 	own	tempo	and	internal	clock	,	they	do	n't	do	quality	time	,	where	you	schedule	10	 minute 	 s 	 	for	them	to	open	up	to	you	.
they	need	you	to	move	at	 the 	 ir 	 	rhythm	.
i	find	that	10	 minute 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	story	,	you	know	,	my	son	will	 sudden 	 ly 	 	say	,	``	you	know	,	 some 	 thing 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	 play 	 ground 	 	 to 	 day 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 both 	 er 	 ed 	 	me	.	``
and	we	'll	go	off	and	have	a	conversation	on	that	.
and	i	now	find	that	 bed 	 time 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	used	to	be	a	box	on	my	to	-	do	list	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	 dread 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	so	 s 	 low 	 	and	i	had	to	get	through	it	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
it	's	 be 	 come 	 	my	reward	at	the	end	of	the	day	,	 some 	 thing 	 	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 cher 	 ish 	 	.
and	i	have	a	kind	of	hollywood	 end 	 ing 	 	to	my	talk	 th 	 is 	 	afternoon	,	which	 go 	 es 	 	a	little	bit	like	 th 	 is 	 	:
a	few	 month 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	was	 get 	 ting 	 	ready	to	go	on	 an 	 other 	 	book	tour	,	and	i	had	my	 bag 	 s 	 	 pack 	 ed 	 	.
i	was	 down 	 stair 	 s 	 	by	the	front	door	,	and	i	was	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	a	taxi	,	and	my	son	came	down	the	 stair 	 s 	 	and	he	'd	made	a	card	for	me	.	and	he	was	 carry 	 ing 	 	it	.
he	'd	gone	and	 staple 	 d 	 	two	 card 	 s 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	like	these	,	together	,	and	put	a	 stick 	 er 	 	of	his	 favor 	 ite 	 	character	,	tintin	,	on	the	front	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	or	he	 hand 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	to	me	,	and	i	read	it	,	and	it	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	to	 d 	 addy 	 	,	love	benjamin	.	``
and	i	thought	,	``	aw	,	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	sweet	.	is	that	a	good	luck	on	the	book	tour	card	?	``
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	no	,	no	,	 d 	 addy 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	card	for	 be 	 ing 	 	the	best	story	 read 	 er 	 	in	the	world	.	``
and	i	thought	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	,	you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 low 	 ing 	 	down	thing	 re 	 ally 	 	 do 	 es 	 	work	.	``
