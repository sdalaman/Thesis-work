i	'm	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	to	be	 give 	 n 	 	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	come	and	speak	to	you	 to 	 day 	 	about	what	i	consider	to	be	the	 big 	 gest 	 	stunt	on	earth	.	or	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	not	 quit 	 e 	 	on	earth	.
a	 parachut 	 e 	 	jump	from	the	 ver 	 y 	 	edge	of	space	.
more	about	that	a	bit	 lat 	 er 	 	on	.
what	i	'd	like	to	do	first	is	take	you	through	a	 ver 	 y 	 	brief	helicopter	ride	of	 stunt 	 s 	 	and	the	 stunt 	 s 	 	industry	in	the	 movie 	 s 	 	and	in	 tele 	 vision 	 	,
and	show	you	how	technology	 ha 	 s 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	to	 inter 	 face 	 	with	the	physical	 skill 	 s 	 	of	the	stunt	 perform 	 er 	 	in	a	way	that	 make 	 s 	 	the	 stunt 	 s 	 	 big 	 ger 	 	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	 make 	 s 	 	them	 safe 	 r 	 	than	they	've	ever	 be 	 en 	 	before	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	a	professional	stunt	man	for	13	 year 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	a	stunt	 coordi 	 nator 	 	.	and	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	perform	 stunt 	 s 	 	i	often	design	them	.
 dur 	 ing 	 	that	time	,	health	and	 safe 	 ty 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	about	my	job	.
it	's	critical	now	that	when	a	car	crash	 happen 	 s 	 	it	is	n't	just	the	stunt	person	we	make	safe	,	it	's	the	crew	.
we	ca	n't	be	 kill 	 ing 	 	camera	men	.	we	ca	n't	be	 kill 	 ing 	 	stunt	men	.
we	ca	n't	be	 kill 	 ing 	 	 any 	 body 	 	or	 hurt 	 ing 	 	 any 	 body 	 	on	set	,	or	any	 pass 	 er 	 by 	 	.	so	,	 safe 	 ty 	 	is	 every 	 thing 	 	.
but	it	was	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	that	way	.
in	the	old	 day 	 s 	 	of	the	silent	 movie 	 s 	 	--	harold	lloyd	here	,	 hang 	 ing 	 	 famous 	 ly 	 	from	the	clock	 hand 	 s 	 	--	a	lot	of	these	 guy 	 s 	 	did	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 stunt 	 s 	 	.	they	 we 	 re 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	.
they	had	no	 safe 	 ty 	 	,	no	real	technology	.
what	 safe 	 ty 	 	they	had	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 cant 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	stunt	woman	,	rosie	venger	,	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	woman	.
you	can	see	from	the	slide	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	.

my	 favor 	 ite 	 	and	a	real	hero	of	mine	is	yakima	canutt	.

he	 work 	 ed 	 	with	john	wayne	and	most	of	 t 	 hose 	 	old	punch	-	 up 	 s 	 	you	see	in	the	westerns	.	yakima	was	either	there	or	he	stunt	 coordinate 	 d 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	screen	capture	from	``	 stage 	 coach 	 	,	``	where	yakima	canutt	is	 do 	 ing 	 	one	of	the	most	 danger 	 ous 	 	 stunt 	 s 	 	i	've	ever	 s 	 een 	 	.
there	is	no	 safe 	 ty 	 	,	no	back	support	,	no	 pad 	 s 	 	,	no	crash	 mat 	 s 	 	,	no	sand	 pit 	 s 	 	in	the	ground	.
that	's	one	of	the	most	 danger 	 ous 	 	horse	 stunt 	 s 	 	,	 certain 	 ly 	 	.

we	could	n't	do	them	 with 	 out 	 	technology	.
these	are	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	there	is	no	mask	on	my	face	.

here	's	a	bit	more	.
there	's	a	guy	with	a	flame	 throw 	 er 	 	there	,	giving	me	what	for	.
one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	a	 stunt 	 man 	 	often	 do 	 es 	 	,	and	you	'll	see	it	every	time	in	the	big	 movie 	 s 	 	,	is	be	blown	through	the	air	.
well	,	we	used	to	use	 tramp 	 ette 	 s 	 	.	in	the	old	 day 	 s 	 	,	that	's	all	they	had	.
and	that	's	a	ramp	.	spring	off	the	thing	and	fly	through	the	air	,
and	 hope 	 fully 	 	you	make	it	look	good	.
now	we	've	got	technology	.	 th 	 is 	 	thing	is	 call 	 ed 	 	an	air	ram	.	it	's	a	 frighten 	 ing 	 	piece	of	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	for	the	 no 	 vice 	 	stunt	 perform 	 er 	 	,
 be 	 cause 	 	it	will	break	your	 leg 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	if	you	land	on	it	wrong	.
 hav 	 ing 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	that	,	it	 work 	 s 	 	with	 compress 	 ed 	 	nitrogen	.
and	that	's	in	the	up	position	.	when	you	step	on	it	,	either	by	remote	control	or	with	the	pressure	of	your	foot	,	it	will	fire	you	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	the	gas	pressure	,	 any 	 thing 	 	from	five	feet	to	30	feet	.
i	could	,	 quit 	 e 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	fire	 my 	 self 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 gall 	 ery 	 	.
which	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	you	would	n't	want	.
not	 to 	 day 	 	.
car	 stunt 	 s 	 	are	 an 	 other 	 	area	where	technology	and	 engineer 	 ing 	 	 advance 	 s 	 	have	made	life	 eas 	 ier 	 	for	us	,	and	 safe 	 r 	 	.
we	can	do	 big 	 ger 	 	car	 stunt 	 s 	 	than	ever	before	now	.
 be 	 ing 	 	run	over	is	never	easy	.
that	's	an	old	-	 fashion 	 ed 	 	,	hard	,	 grit 	 ty 	 	,	physical	stunt	.
but	we	have	 padd 	 ing 	 	,	and	fantastic	shock	-	 absorb 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	sorbothane	--
the	 material 	 s 	 	that	help	us	,	when	we	're	hit	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	not	to	hurt	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	too	much	.
the	picture	in	the	bottom	right	-	hand	corner	there	is	of	some	crash	test	 d 	 um 	 my 	 	work	that	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	.

a	company	 make 	 s 	 	a	lattix	pillar	,	which	is	a	network	,	a	lattice	-	type	pillar	that	 collapse 	 s 	 	when	it	's	hit	.
the	car	on	the	left	drove	 in 	 to 	 	the	steel	pillar	.
and	you	ca	n't	see	it	from	there	,	but	the	engine	was	in	the	driver	's	lap	.
they	did	it	by	remote	control	.
i	drove	the	other	one	at	60	 mile 	 s 	 	an	hour	,	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	speed	,	and	 clear 	 ly 	 	 walk 	 ed 	 	away	from	it	.
 roll 	 ing 	 	a	car	over	is	 an 	 other 	 	area	where	we	use	technology	.
we	used	to	have	to	drive	up	a	ramp	,	and	we	still	do	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	.
but	now	we	have	a	 compress 	 ed 	 	nitrogen	 can 	 non 	 	.
you	can	just	see	,	 under 	 neath 	 	the	car	,	there	is	a	black	rod	on	the	floor	by	the	wheel	of	the	other	car	.
that	's	the	piston	that	was	 fire 	 d 	 	out	of	the	floor	.
we	can	flip	 lor 	 ries 	 	,	 coach 	 es 	 	,	 bus 	 es 	 	,	 any 	 thing 	 	over	with	a	nitrogen	 can 	 non 	 	with	 en 	 ough 	 	power	.
it	's	a	great	job	,	 re 	 ally 	 	.
it	's	 s 	 uch 	 	 f 	 un 	 	!
you	should	hear	some	of	the	phone	 conversation 	 s 	 	that	i	have	with	people	on	my	bluetooth	in	the	shop	.
``	well	,	we	can	flip	the	bus	over	,	we	can	have	it	burst	 in 	 to 	 	 flame 	 s 	 	,	and	how	about	 some 	 one 	 	,	you	know	,	big	explosion	.	``
and	people	are	looking	like	 th 	 is 	 	...
i	sort	of	forget	how	bizarre	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 conversation 	 s 	 	are	.
the	next	thing	that	i	'd	like	to	show	you	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	dunlop	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	to	do	 ear 	 lier 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	with	our	channel	five	's	``	fifth	gear	show	.	``
a	loop	-	the	-	loop	,	 big 	 gest 	 	in	the	world	.
 on 	 ly 	 	one	person	had	ever	 d 	 one 	 	it	before	.
now	,	the	 stunt 	 man 	 	solution	to	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	old	 day 	 s 	 	would	be	,	``	let	's	hit	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	fast	 a 	 s 	 	possible	.	60	 mile 	 s 	 	an	hour	.	let	's	just	go	for	it	.	foot	flat	to	the	floor	.	``
well	,	you	'd	die	if	you	did	that	.
we	went	to	cambridge	university	,	the	other	university	,	and	spoke	to	a	doctor	of	 mechanic 	 al 	 	 engineer 	 ing 	 	there	,	a	physicist	who	taught	us	that	it	had	to	be	37	 mile 	 s 	 	an	hour	.
even	then	,	i	caught	seven	g	and	lost	a	bit	of	 conscious 	 ness 	 	on	the	way	in	.
that	's	a	long	way	to	fall	,	if	you	get	it	wrong	.	that	was	just	about	right	.	so	 aga 	 in 	 	,	science	 help 	 s 	 	us	,	and	with	the	 engineer 	 ing 	 	too	--
the	 mod 	 ification 	 s 	 	to	the	car	and	the	wheel	.
high	 fall 	 s 	 	,	they	're	old	 fashion 	 ed 	 	 stunt 	 s 	 	.
what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	about	high	 fall 	 s 	 	is	that	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	we	use	 airbag 	 s 	 	,	and	some	 airbag 	 s 	 	are	 quit 	 e 	 	 advance 	 d 	 	,	they	're	designed	so	you	do	n't	slip	off	the	side	like	you	used	to	,	if	you	land	a	bit	wrong	.	so	,	they	're	a	much	 safe 	 r 	 	 pro 	 position 	 	.
just	 bas 	 ically 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	,	it	is	a	 bas 	 ic 	 	piece	of	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	.
it	's	a	 bounc 	 y 	 	castle	with	 s 	 lat 	 s 	 	in	the	side	to	allow	the	air	to	 es 	 cape 	 	.
that	's	all	it	is	,	a	 bounc 	 y 	 	castle	.
that	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	reason	we	do	it	.	see	,	it	's	all	 f 	 un 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	job	.
what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	we	still	use	 card 	 board 	 	boxes	.
they	used	to	use	 card 	 board 	 	boxes	 year 	 s 	 	ago	and	we	still	use	them	.
and	that	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	 al 	 most 	 	 retrospect 	 ive 	 	.
they	're	great	for	 catch 	 ing 	 	you	,	up	to	certain	 height 	 s 	 	.
and	on	the	other	side	of	the	 f 	 ence 	 	,	that	physical	art	,	the	physical	performance	of	the	 stunt 	 man 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 inter 	 face 	 d 	 	with	the	 ver 	 y 	 	highest	technology	in	i.t	.	and	in	 soft 	 ware 	 	.
not	the	 card 	 board 	 	box	,	but	the	green	screen	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	shot	of	``	terminator	,	``	the	movie	.
two	stunt	 guy 	 s 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	what	i	consider	to	be	a	 ra 	 ther 	 	benign	stunt	.
it	's	30	feet	.	it	's	water	.	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	.
with	the	green	screen	we	can	put	any	 back 	 ground 	 	in	the	world	on	it	,	moving	or	still	,
and	i	can	assure	you	,	 now 	 a 	 day 	 s 	 	you	ca	n't	see	the	joint	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 parachut 	 ist 	 	with	 an 	 other 	 	 parachut 	 ist 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	thing	.
 complete 	 ly 	 	in	the	 safe 	 ty 	 	of	a	studio	,	and	yet	with	the	green	screen	we	can	have	some	moving	image	that	a	 skydive 	 r 	 	took	,	and	put	in	the	sky	moving	and	the	 cloud 	 s 	 	 whiz 	 z 	 ing 	 	by	.

helicopter	 stunt 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 ways 	 	 f 	 un 	 	,	 hang 	 ing 	 	out	of	them	,	 what 	 ever 	 	.
and	 a 	 erial 	 	 stunt 	 s 	 	.	no	 a 	 erial 	 	stunt	would	be	the	same	 with 	 out 	 	 sky 	 div 	 ing 	 	.
which	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	us	 quit 	 e 	 	 nice 	 ly 	 	to	why	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	here	 to 	 day 	 	:
project	space	jump	.
in	1960	,	joseph	kittenger	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	air	force	did	the	most	spectacular	thing	.
he	did	a	jump	from	100,000	feet	,	102,000	to	be	precise	,	and	he	did	it	to	test	high	altitude	 system 	 s 	 	for	 militar 	 y 	 	 pilot 	 s 	 	in	the	new	range	of	 air 	 craft 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	going	up	to	80,000	feet	or	so	.
and	i	'd	just	like	to	show	you	a	little	 foot 	 age 	 	of	what	he	did	back	then	.
and	just	how	brave	he	was	in	1960	,	bear	in	mind	.	project	excelsior	,	it	was	 call 	 ed 	 	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	three	 jump 	 s 	 	.
they	first	 drop 	 ped 	 	some	 d 	 um 	 mies 	 	.
so	that	's	the	balloon	,	big	gas	balloon	.
it	's	that	shape	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 hel 	 ium 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	expand	.
my	balloon	will	expand	to	500	 time 	 s 	 	and	look	like	a	big	 pump 	 kin 	 	when	it	's	at	the	top	.
these	are	the	 d 	 um 	 mies 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 drop 	 ped 	 	from	100,000	feet	,
and	there	is	the	camera	that	's	 s 	 trapped 	 	to	them	.
you	can	 clear 	 ly 	 	see	the	 curv 	 ature 	 	of	the	earth	at	that	kind	of	altitude	.
and	i	'm	 plan 	 ning 	 	to	go	from	120,000	feet	,
which	is	about	22	 mile 	 s 	 	.
you	're	in	a	near	vacuum	in	that	environment	,
which	is	in	minus	50	 degree 	 s 	 	.	so	it	's	an	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 hostil 	 e 	 	place	to	be	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	joe	kittenger	 him 	 self 	 	.
bear	in	mind	,	 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gent 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	1960	.
he	did	n't	know	if	he	would	live	or	die	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	brave	man	.
i	spoke	with	him	on	the	phone	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	ago	.
he	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	humble	and	 wonder 	 ful 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 	.
he	 s 	 ent 	 	me	an	email	,	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	if	you	get	 th 	 is 	 	thing	off	the	ground	i	wish	you	all	the	best	.	``	and	he	 sign 	 ed 	 	it	,	``	happy	 land 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	``
which	i	thought	was	 quit 	 e 	 	 love 	 ly 	 	.
he	's	in	his	80s	and	he	 live 	 s 	 	in	florida	.	he	's	a	tremendous	guy	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	him	in	a	pressure	suit	.
now	one	of	the	 challeng 	 es 	 	of	going	up	to	altitude	is	when	you	get	to	30,000	feet	--	it	's	great	,	is	n't	it	?	--	when	you	get	to	30,000	feet	you	can	 re 	 ally 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	use	oxygen	.
above	30,000	feet	up	to	 near 	 ly 	 	50,000	feet	,	you	need	pressure	 breath 	 ing 	 	,	which	is	where	you	're	 wear 	 ing 	 	a	g	suit	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	him	in	his	old	rock	-	and	-	roll	 jean 	 s 	 	there	,	 push 	 ing 	 	him	in	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	up	 jean 	 s 	 	.
you	need	a	pressure	suit	.
you	need	a	pressure	 breath 	 ing 	 	system	with	a	g	suit	that	 squeez 	 es 	 	you	,	that	 help 	 s 	 	you	to	breathe	in	and	 help 	 s 	 	you	to	 exhal 	 e 	 	.
above	50,000	feet	you	need	a	space	suit	,	a	pressure	suit	.
 certain 	 ly 	 	at	100,000	feet	no	 air 	 craft 	 	will	fly	.
not	even	a	jet	engine	.
it	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	rocket	-	powered	or	one	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	a	great	big	gas	balloon	.
it	took	me	a	while	;	it	took	me	 year 	 s 	 	to	find	the	right	balloon	team	to	build	the	balloon	that	would	do	 th 	 is 	 	job	.
i	've	found	that	team	in	america	now	.
and	it	's	made	of	polyethylene	,	so	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	thin	.
we	will	have	two	 balloon 	 s 	 	for	each	of	my	test	 jump 	 s 	 	,
and	two	 balloon 	 s 	 	for	the	main	jump	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 notorious 	 ly 	 	tear	on	 take 	 off 	 	.
they	're	just	so	,	so	 delic 	 ate 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	step	off	.	he	's	written	on	that	thing	,	``	the	highest	step	in	the	world	.	``
and	what	must	that	feel	like	?
i	'm	 excit 	 ed 	 	and	i	'm	 scar 	 ed 	 	,
both	at	the	same	time	in	equal	 measure 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	camera	that	he	had	on	him	 a 	 s 	 	he	 tumble 	 d 	 	before	his	 dr 	 ogue 	 	chute	 open 	 ed 	 	to	 stabil 	 ize 	 	him	.
a	 dr 	 ogue 	 	chute	is	just	a	 small 	 er 	 	chute	which	 help 	 s 	 	to	keep	your	face	down	.
you	can	just	see	them	there	,	 pop 	 ping 	 	open	.
 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	 dr 	 ogue 	 	 chute 	 s 	 	.	he	had	three	of	them	.
i	did	 quit 	 e 	 	a	lot	of	research	.
and	you	'll	see	in	a	second	there	,	he	 come 	 s 	 	back	down	to	the	floor	.
now	just	to	give	you	some	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	balloon	,	the	little	black	 dot 	 s 	 	are	people	.
it	's	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	feet	high	.	it	's	enormous	.
that	's	in	new	mexico	.
that	's	the	u.s.	air	force	museum	.
and	they	've	made	a	 d 	 um 	 my 	 	of	him	.	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	it	 look 	 ed 	 	like	.
my	gondola	will	be	more	simple	than	that	.
it	's	a	three	sided	box	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	.
so	i	've	had	to	do	 quit 	 e 	 	a	lot	of	training	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	morocco	last	year	in	the	atlas	 mountain 	 s 	 	,	training	in	 pre 	 par 	 ation 	 	for	some	high	altitude	 jump 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	the	view	is	going	to	be	like	at	90,000	feet	for	me	.
now	you	may	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	a	thrill	-	seeking	trip	,	a	pleasure	ride	,	just	the	world	's	 big 	 gest 	 	stunt	.
well	there	's	a	little	bit	more	to	it	than	that	.
 try 	 ing 	 	to	find	a	space	suit	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	led	me	to	an	area	of	technology	that	i	never	 re 	 ally 	 	 expect 	 ed 	 	when	i	set	about	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	 contact 	 ed 	 	a	company	in	the	 state 	 s 	 	who	make	 suit 	 s 	 	for	nasa	.
that	's	a	current	suit	.	 th 	 is 	 	was	me	last	year	with	 the 	 ir 	 	chief	engineer	.
that	suit	would	cost	me	about	a	million	and	a	half	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
and	it	 weigh 	 s 	 	300	 pound 	 s 	 	and	you	ca	n't	skydive	in	it	.
so	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 tuck 	 	.	for	the	past	15	 year 	 s 	 	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	find	a	space	suit	that	would	do	 th 	 is 	 	job	,	or	 some 	 one 	 	that	will	make	one	.
 some 	 thing 	 	 revolution 	 ary 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	a	little	while	ago	,	at	the	same	 facil 	 ity 	 	.
that	's	the	prototype	of	the	 parachut 	 e 	 	.	i	've	now	had	them	custom	make	one	,
the	 on 	 ly 	 	one	of	 it 	 s 	 	kind	in	the	world	.	and	that	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	suit	of	 it 	 s 	 	kind	in	the	world	.
it	was	made	by	a	russian	that	's	designed	most	of	the	 suit 	 s 	 	of	the	past	18	 year 	 s 	 	for	the	soviets	.
he	left	the	company	 be 	 cause 	 	he	saw	,	 a 	 s 	 	some	other	people	in	the	space	suit	industry	,	an	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	market	for	space	 suit 	 s 	 	for	space	 tourist 	 s 	 	.
you	know	if	you	are	in	an	 air 	 craft 	 	at	30,000	feet	and	the	 cab 	 in 	 	 depress 	 ur 	 ize 	 s 	 	,	you	can	have	oxygen	.
if	you	're	at	100,000	feet	you	die	.
in	six	 second 	 s 	 	you	've	lost	 conscious 	 ness 	 	.	in	10	 second 	 s 	 	you	're	dead	.
your	blood	tries	to	boil	.	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	 vapor 	 ization 	 	.
the	body	 s 	 well 	 s 	 	up	.	it	's	awful	.
and	so	we	expect	--	it	's	not	much	 f 	 un 	 	.
we	expect	,	and	 other 	 s 	 	expect	,	that	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	the	faa	,	the	caa	might	say	,	``	you	need	to	put	 some 	 one 	 	in	a	suit	that	's	not	inflated	,	that	's	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	the	 air 	 craft 	 	.	``
then	they	're	 comfort 	 able 	 	,	they	have	good	vision	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	great	big	visor	.
and	then	if	the	 cab 	 in 	 	 depress 	 ur 	 ize 	 s 	 	while	the	 air 	 craft 	 	is	coming	back	down	,	in	 what 	 ever 	 	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	 measure 	 s 	 	,	 every 	 one 	 	is	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
i	would	like	to	 br 	 ing 	 	costa	on	,	if	he	's	here	,
to	show	you	the	 on 	 ly 	 	one	of	 it 	 s 	 	kind	in	the	world	.
i	was	going	to	wear	it	,
but	i	thought	i	'd	get	costa	to	do	it	,	my	 love 	 ly 	 	 assist 	 ant 	 	.	thank	you	.	he	's	 ver 	 y 	 	hot	.	thank	you	,	costa	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	communication	 head 	 set 	 	you	'll	see	on	 lot 	 s 	 	of	space	 suit 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	two	-	layer	suit	.	nasa	 suit 	 s 	 	have	got	13	 layer 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 light 	 weight 	 	suit	.	it	 weigh 	 s 	 	about	15	 pound 	 s 	 	.
it	's	next	to	 noth 	 ing 	 	.	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	designed	for	me	.
it	's	a	 work 	 ing 	 	prototype	.	i	will	use	it	for	all	the	 jump 	 s 	 	.
would	you	just	give	us	a	little	twirl	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	,	costa	?
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
and	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	look	far	different	when	it	's	inflated	,
 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	from	the	picture	down	there	.
i	've	even	 skydive 	 d 	 	in	it	in	a	wind	tunnel	,
which	 mean 	 s 	 	that	i	can	practice	 every 	 thing 	 	i	need	to	practice	,	in	 safe 	 ty 	 	,	before	i	ever	jump	out	of	 any 	 thing 	 	.	 thank 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	,	costa	.
 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	that	's	just	about	it	from	me	.
the	 stat 	 us 	 	of	my	mission	at	the	moment	is	it	still	 need 	 s 	 	a	major	sponsor	.
i	'm	confident	that	we	'll	find	one	.
i	think	it	's	a	great	 challeng 	 e 	 	.
and	i	hope	that	you	will	agree	with	me	,	it	is	the	 great 	 est 	 	stunt	on	earth	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	for	your	time	.
