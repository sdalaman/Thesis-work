in	 th 	 is 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	long	sort	of	marathon	 present 	 ation 	 	,	i	've	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	break	it	up	 in 	 to 	 	three	 part 	 s 	 	:	the	first	 be 	 ing 	 	a	whole	lot	of	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	on	how	it	can	be	a	little	bit	more	 pleas 	 ur 	 able 	 	to	deal	with	a	computer	and	 re 	 ally 	 	address	the	 qual 	 ities 	 	of	the	human	 inter 	 face 	 	.
and	these	will	be	some	simple	design	 qual 	 ities 	 	and	they	will	 al 	 so 	 	be	some	 qual 	 ities 	 	of	,	if	you	will	,	the	 intellig 	 ence 	 	of	 interact 	 ion 	 	.
then	the	second	part	will	 re 	 ally 	 	just	be	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	new	 techno 	 logies 	 	--	new	media	 fall 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	 in 	 to 	 	that	mold	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	i	will	go	through	them	 a 	 s 	 	fast	 a 	 s 	 	possible	.
and	then	the	last	one	will	be	some	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	collect	,	which	i	think	 illustr 	 ate 	 	 th 	 is 	 	at	 l 	 east 	 	 a 	 s 	 	best	i	can	,	in	the	world	of	 entertain 	 ment 	 	.
people	have	 th 	 is 	 	belief	--	and	i	share	most	of	it	--	that	we	will	be	using	the	tv	 screen 	 s 	 	or	 the 	 ir 	 	 equi 	 valent 	 s 	 	for	 electron 	 ic 	 	 book 	 s 	 	of	the	future	.	but	then	you	think	,	``	my	god	!	what	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	image	you	get	when	you	look	at	still	 picture 	 s 	 	on	tv	.	``
well	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	to	be	 terr 	 ible 	 	.
and	that	is	a	slide	taken	from	a	tv	set	and	it	was	pre	-	 process 	 ed 	 	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 sym 	 pathetic 	 	to	the	tv	medium	,	and	it	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 look 	 s 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
well	,	what	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	?	how	did	people	get	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	mess	?
where	you	are	now	,	all	of	a	sudden	,	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	front	of	personal	 computer 	 s 	 	and	video	text	--	teletext	 system 	 s 	 	,	and	 some 	 what 	 	 horr 	 ified 	 	by	what	you	see	on	the	screen	?
well	,	you	have	to	remember	that	tv	was	designed	to	be	 look 	 ed 	 	at	eight	 time 	 s 	 	the	distance	of	the	diagonal	.
so	you	get	a	13	-	inch	,	19	-	inch	,	 what 	 ever 	 	,	tv	,
and	then	you	should	 multi 	 ply 	 	that	by	eight	and	that	's	the	distance	you	should	 s 	 it 	 	away	from	the	tv	set	.
now	we	've	put	people	18	 inch 	 es 	 	in	front	of	a	tv	,	and	all	the	 artifact 	 s 	 	that	 non 	 e 	 	of	the	original	 design 	 ers 	 	 expect 	 ed 	 	to	be	 s 	 een 	 	,	all	of	a	sudden	,	are	 star 	 ing 	 	you	in	the	face	:	the	shadow	mask	,	the	 s 	 can 	 	lines	,	all	of	that	.
and	they	can	be	 treat 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	;
there	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	ways	of	 get 	 ting 	 	rid	of	them	,
there	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	ways	of	just	making	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	here	a	little	bit	about	 dis 	 play 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	.
let	me	talk	about	how	you	might	 in 	 put 	 	information	.
and	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	is	 al 	 ways 	 	 finger 	 s 	 	.	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	touch	-	sensitive	 dis 	 play 	 s 	 	.	high	-	tech	,	high	-	touch	.	is	n't	that	what	some	of	you	 s 	 aid 	 	?
it	's	 certain 	 ly 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	medium	for	 in 	 put 	 	,
and	a	lot	of	people	think	that	 finger 	 s 	 	are	a	 ver 	 y 	 	low	-	 re 	 solution 	 	sort	of	 styl 	 us 	 	for	inputting	to	a	 dis 	 play 	 	.
in	fact	,	they	're	not	:	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	high	-	 re 	 solution 	 	 in 	 put 	 	medium	--
you	have	to	just	do	it	twice	,	you	have	to	touch	the	screen	and	then	 rot 	 ate 	 	your	finger	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	--
and	you	can	move	a	cursor	with	great	 accu 	 racy 	 	.
and	so	when	you	see	on	the	market	these	 system 	 s 	 	that	have	just	a	few	light	 emit 	 ting 	 	diodes	on	the	side	and	are	 ver 	 y 	 	low	 re 	 solution 	 	,	it	's	nice	that	they	exist	 be 	 cause 	 	it	still	is	better	than	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
but	it	,	in	some	sense	,	 mis 	 s 	 es 	 	the	point	:	 name 	 ly 	 	,	that	 finger 	 s 	 	are	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	high	-	 re 	 solution 	 	 in 	 put 	 	medium	.
now	,	what	are	some	of	the	other	 advantage 	 s 	 	?
well	,	the	one	advantage	is	that	you	do	n't	have	to	pick	them	up	,
and	people	do	n't	 real 	 ize 	 	how	 import 	 ant 	 	that	is	--	not	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	pick	up	your	 finger 	 s 	 	to	use	them	.
when	you	think	for	a	second	of	the	mouse	on	macintosh	--	and	i	will	not	 critic 	 ize 	 	the	mouse	too	much	--	when	you	're	 ty 	 ping 	 	--	what	you	have	--	you	want	to	now	put	 some 	 thing 	 	--	first	of	all	,	you	've	got	to	find	the	mouse	.
you	have	to	 prob 	 ably 	 	stop	.	 may 	 be 	 	not	come	to	a	 grind 	 ing 	 	halt	,	but	you	've	got	to	sort	of	find	that	mouse	.	then	you	find	the	mouse	,	and	you	're	going	to	have	to	 wig 	 gle 	 	it	a	little	bit	to	see	where	the	cursor	is	on	the	screen	.
and	then	when	you	 final 	 ly 	 	see	where	it	is	,	then	you	've	got	to	move	it	to	get	the	cursor	over	there	,	and	then	--	``	bang	``	--	you	've	got	to	hit	a	button	or	do	 what 	 ever 	 	.
that	's	four	 separat 	 e 	 	 step 	 s 	 	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	 ty 	 ping 	 	and	then	 touch 	 ing 	 	and	 ty 	 ping 	 	and	just	 do 	 ing 	 	it	all	in	one	motion	--	or	one	-	and	-	a	-	half	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	how	you	want	to	count	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	what	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	is	just	 illustr 	 ate 	 	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 problem 	 s 	 	that	i	think	face	the	 design 	 ers 	 	of	new	computer	 system 	 s 	 	and	 entertain 	 ment 	 	 system 	 s 	 	and	 education 	 al 	 	 system 	 s 	 	from	the	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	of	the	quality	of	that	 inter 	 face 	 	.
and	 an 	 other 	 	advantage	,	of	course	,	of	using	 finger 	 s 	 	is	you	have	10	of	them	.
and	we	have	never	known	how	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	 technical 	 ly 	 	,
so	 th 	 is 	 	slide	is	a	fake	slide	.
we	never	 succeed 	 ed 	 	in	using	ten	 finger 	 s 	 	,	but	there	are	certain	 thing 	 s 	 	you	can	do	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	with	more	than	one	-	finger	 in 	 put 	 	,	which	is	 ra 	 ther 	 	 fasci 	 nating 	 	.
what	we	did	 s 	 tumble 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	was	 some 	 thing 	 	...	 aga 	 in 	 	,	which	is	typical	of	the	computer	field	,	is	when	you	have	a	bug	that	you	ca	n't	get	rid	of	you	turn	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	feature	.
and	 may 	 be 	 	...	 may 	 be 	 	a	mouse	is	a	new	kind	of	bug	.
but	the	bug	in	our	case	was	in	touch	-	sensitive	 dis 	 play 	 s 	 	:
we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	able	to	draw	--	you	know	,	rub	your	finger	 a 	 cross 	 	the	screen	to	 in 	 put 	 	 continu 	 ous 	 	 point 	 s 	 	--
and	there	was	just	too	much	friction	 create 	 d 	 	between	your	finger	and	the	glass	--	if	glass	was	the	substrate	,	which	it	 usual 	 ly 	 	is	.
so	we	found	that	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	was	a	feature	in	the	sense	you	could	build	a	pressure	-	sensitive	 dis 	 play 	 	.
and	when	you	touch	it	with	your	finger	,	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	then	,	 introduc 	 e 	 	all	the	 force 	 s 	 	on	the	face	of	that	screen	,	and	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	certain	amount	of	value	.
let	me	see	if	i	can	load	 an 	 other 	 	 dis 	 c 	 	and	show	you	,	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
now	,	imagine	a	screen	,	which	is	not	 on 	 ly 	 	touch	-	sensitive	now	,	it	's	pressure	-	sensitive	.
and	it	's	pressure	-	sensitive	to	the	 force 	 s 	 	both	in	the	plane	of	the	screen	--	x	,	y	,	and	z	at	 l 	 east 	 	in	one	direction	;	we	could	n't	figure	out	how	to	come	in	the	other	direction	.
but	let	me	get	rid	of	the	slide	,
and	let	's	see	if	 th 	 is 	 	 come 	 s 	 	on	.
ok	.	so	there	is	the	pressure	-	sensitive	 dis 	 play 	 	in	operation	.
the	person	's	just	,	if	you	will	,	 push 	 ing 	 	on	the	screen	to	make	a	 curv 	 e 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	part	.
i	want	to	stop	it	for	a	second	 be 	 cause 	 	the	movie	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 bad 	 ly 	 	made	.
and	the	 part 	 icular 	 	 dis 	 play 	 	was	built	about	six	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	when	we	 move 	 d 	 	from	one	room	to	 an 	 other 	 	room	,	a	 ra 	 ther 	 	large	person	 s 	 at 	 	on	it	and	it	got	 destroy 	 ed 	 	.
so	all	we	have	is	 th 	 is 	 	record	.
but	imagine	that	screen	 hav 	 ing 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 object 	 s 	 	on	it
and	the	person	 ha 	 s 	 	 touch 	 ed 	 	an	object	--	one	of	n	--	like	he	did	there	,	and	then	 push 	 ed 	 	on	it	.
now	,	imagine	a	program	where	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 object 	 s 	 	are	 physical 	 ly 	 	heavy	and	some	are	light	:
one	is	an	 an 	 vil 	 	on	a	 fuzz 	 y 	 	rug	and	the	other	one	is	a	ping	-	pong	ball	on	a	sheet	of	glass	.
and	when	you	touch	it	,	you	have	to	 re 	 ally 	 	push	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	move	that	 an 	 vil 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	screen	,
and	yet	you	touch	the	ping	-	pong	ball	 ver 	 y 	 	 light 	 ly 	 	and	it	just	scoots	 a 	 cross 	 	the	screen	.
and	what	you	can	do	--	 oop 	 s 	 	,	i	did	n't	mean	to	do	that	--	what	you	can	do	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	feed	back	to	the	user	the	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	the	physical	 proper 	 ties 	 	.
so	 aga 	 in 	 	,	they	do	n't	have	to	be	weight	;
they	could	be	a	general	 try 	 ing 	 	to	move	 troop 	 s 	 	,	and	he	's	got	to	move	an	 air 	 craft 	 	 car 	 rier 	 	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	a	little	boat	.
in	fact	,	they	funded	it	for	that	 ver 	 y 	 	reason	.
the	whole	 not 	 ion 	 	,	then	,	is	one	that	at	the	 inter 	 face 	 	there	are	physical	 proper 	 ties 	 	in	that	transducer	--	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	it	's	pressure	and	 touch 	 es 	 	--	that	allow	you	to	present	 thing 	 s 	 	to	the	user	that	you	could	never	present	before	.
so	it	's	not	 simpl 	 y 	 	looking	at	the	quality	or	,	if	you	will	,	the	 luxur 	 y 	 	of	that	 inter 	 face 	 	,	but	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	looking	at	the	idea	of	 present 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 previous 	 ly 	 	could	n't	be	 present 	 ed 	 	before	.
i	want	to	move	on	to	 an 	 other 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	which	is	one	of	a	different	sort	,	where	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	use	computer	and	video	 dis 	 c 	 	technology	now	to	come	up	with	a	new	kind	of	book	.
here	,	the	idea	is	that	you	're	going	to	take	 th 	 is 	 	book	,	if	you	will	,	and	it	's	going	to	come	 al 	 ive 	 	.
you	're	going	to	sort	of	breathe	life	 in 	 to 	 	it	.
we	are	so	used	to	 do 	 ing 	 	 monologue 	 s 	 	.
 film 	 makers 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	are	the	 expert 	 s 	 	in	monologue	making	:
you	make	a	film	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	well	-	 form 	 ed 	 	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	middle	and	end	,
and	in	some	sense	the	art	of	it	is	that	.
and	you	then	say	,	``	there	's	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	for	making	 conversation 	 al 	 	 movie 	 s 	 	.	``	well	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	?
and	it	sort	of	nibbles	at	the	core	of	the	whole	profession	and	all	the	 assumption 	 s 	 	of	that	medium	.
so	,	book	writing	is	the	same	thing	.
what	i	'll	show	you	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	is	a	new	kind	of	book	where	it	is	 mix 	 ed 	 	now	with	...	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	live	in	there	,	but	you	have	to	keep	a	few	 thing 	 s 	 	in	mind	.
one	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	book	 know 	 s 	 	about	 it 	 self 	 	.
each	frame	of	the	movie	 ha 	 s 	 	information	about	 it 	 self 	 	.
so	it	 know 	 s 	 	,	or	at	 l 	 east 	 	there	is	computer	-	 read 	 able 	 	information	in	the	medium	 it 	 self 	 	.	it	's	just	not	a	static	movie	frame	.
that	's	one	thing	.	the	other	is	that	you	have	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	it	is	a	random	access	medium	,	and	you	can	,	in	fact	,	branch	and	expand	and	elaborate	and	shrink	.
and	here	--	 aga 	 in 	 	,	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	--	is	the	 cook 	 book 	 	,	the	``	larousse	gastronomique	.	``
and	i	think	i	use	the	 ex 	 ample 	 	all	too	often	,	but	it	's	a	great	one	 be 	 cause 	 	there	is	a	classic	 end 	 ing 	 	in	that	little	encyclopedia	-	style	 cook 	 book 	 	that	 tell 	 s 	 	you	how	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	like	penguin	,	and	you	get	to	the	end	of	the	recipe	and	it	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	cook	 un 	 til 	 	 d 	 one 	 	.	``
now	,	that	would	be	,	if	you	will	,	the	top	green	track	,	which	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	too	much	.	but	you	might	have	to	elaborate	for	me	or	for	 some 	 body 	 	who	is	n't	an	expert	,	and	say	,	``	cook	at	380	 degree 	 s 	 	for	45	 minute 	 s 	 	.	``
and	then	for	a	real	 beg 	 inner 	 	,	you	would	go	down	even	further	and	elaborate	more	--	say	,	``	open	the	oven	,	preheat	,	wait	for	the	light	to	go	out	,	open	the	door	,	do	n't	 leav 	 e 	 	it	open	too	long	,	put	the	penguin	in	and	shut	the	door	.	.	.	``	 what 	 ever 	 	.
and	that	's	a	much	more	elaborate	one	than	you	dribble	back	.
that	's	one	kind	of	use	of	random	access	.	and	the	other	is	where	you	want	to	explain	the	same	thing	in	different	ways	.
if	you	're	in	a	 class 	 room 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	and	 some 	 body 	 	 ask 	 s 	 	a	question	,	the	last	thing	you	do	is	repeat	what	you	just	 s 	 aid 	 	.
you	try	and	think	of	a	different	way	of	 say 	 ing 	 	the	same	thing	,	or	if	you	know	the	 part 	 icular 	 	student	and	that	student	's	cognitive	style	,	then	you	might	say	it	in	a	way	that	you	think	would	have	a	good	impedance	match	with	that	student	.
there	are	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	you	will	use	--	and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	different	kind	of	 branch 	 ing 	 	.
so	,	what	i	will	show	you	is	...	it	's	a	 ra 	 ther 	 	 bor 	 ing 	 	book	,	but	i	'm	 af 	 raid 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	you	have	to	do	 bor 	 ing 	 	 book 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	your	 sponsor 	 s 	 	are	n't	 necess 	 arily 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	fiction	and	 entertain 	 ment 	 	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	book	on	how	to	repair	a	 trans 	 mission 	 	.
now	,	i	do	n't	even	know	what	vintage	the	 trans 	 mission 	 	is	,	but	let	me	just	show	you	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	some	of	it	,	and	we	'll	move	on	.

i	can	get	back	to	the	 illustr 	 ation 	 	,	but	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	it	's	not	a	single	frame	,
but	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	movie	of	 some 	 one 	 	coming	 in 	 to 	 	the	frame	and	 do 	 ing 	 	the	repair	that	's	 de 	 scribed 	 	in	the	text	.

ok	.	i	'm	at	the	third	and	last	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	which	i	 s 	 aid 	 	i	would	make	an	attempt	to	at	 l 	 east 	 	give	you	some	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	that	may	be	more	 direct 	 ly 	 	related	to	the	world	of	 entertain 	 ment 	 	.
and	of	course	,	good	education	 ha 	 s 	 	got	to	be	good	 entertain 	 ment 	 	,
so	my	first	 ex 	 ample 	 	will	be	drawn	from	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 re 	 cent 	 	experiment	that	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	--	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	in	senegal	--	where	we	have	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	use	personal	 computer 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 ped 	 ago 	 gical 	 	medium	.	but	not	 a 	 s 	 	 teach 	 ing 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	at	all	;
the	whole	 not 	 ion 	 	is	to	use	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	instrument	where	there	is	a	complete	 revers 	 al 	 	of	 role 	 s 	 	--
the	child	is	,	if	you	will	,	the	teacher	and	the	machine	is	the	student	--
and	the	art	of	computer	 programm 	 ing 	 	is	a	vehicle	that	sort	of	approximates	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 think 	 ing 	 	.
but	 teach 	 ing 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	 programm 	 ing 	 	per	 s 	 e 	 	is	 utter 	 ly 	 	 ir 	 relevant 	 	.
and	there	are	just	a	few	 slide 	 s 	 	i	want	to	go	through	,	but	there	's	a	story	i	'd	like	to	tell	.	and	that	was	when	,	before	we	did	 th 	 is 	 	in	any	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	--	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	,	in	fact	,	in	three	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	right	now	:	pakistan	,	colombia	and	senegal	--
we	did	it	in	some	 pre 	 tty 	 	rough	 area 	 s 	 	of	new	york	city	.
and	one	child	,	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	name	i	've	 for 	 gotten 	 	,	was	about	seven	or	eight	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 consider 	 ed 	 	 ment 	 ally 	 	 handicap 	 ped 	 	--	could	n't	read	,	did	n't	even	make	it	in	the	 low 	 est 	 	section	of	the	school	's	 class 	 es 	 	--
and	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	not	in	school	,	 th 	 ough 	 	 physical 	 ly 	 	there	.
but	did	hang	around	the	,	quote	,	``	computer	room	,	``	where	there	 we 	 re 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	a	few	 computer 	 s 	 	,	and	 learn 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	language	 call 	 ed 	 	logo	--
and	 learn 	 ed 	 	it	with	great	ease	and	found	it	a	lot	of	 f 	 un 	 	,
it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.	and	one	day	,	by	chance	,	some	 visit 	 ors 	 	from	the	nie	came	by	in	 the 	 ir 	 	double	-	breasted	 suit 	 s 	 	looking	at	 th 	 is 	 	 set 	 up 	 	,	and	 non 	 e 	 	of	the	children	who	 we 	 re 	 	 normal 	 ly 	 	there	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	one	child	,	 we 	 re 	 	there	.
he	was	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	let	me	show	you	how	 th 	 is 	 	 work 	 s 	 	,	``
and	they	got	an	 absolute 	 ly 	 	ingenuous	,	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	of	logo	.
and	the	child	was	just	 zip 	 ping 	 	right	through	it	,	 show 	 ing 	 	them	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	 un 	 til 	 	they	 ask 	 ed 	 	him	how	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	which	he	could	n't	explain
and	so	he	 flip 	 ped 	 	through	the	manual	,	found	the	 explan 	 ation 	 	and	 type 	 d 	 	the	command	and	got	it	to	do	what	they	 ask 	 ed 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 de 	 light 	 ed 	 	,	and	by	the	time	it	was	time	to	go	see	the	principal	,	whom	they	'd	 actual 	 ly 	 	come	to	see	--	not	the	computer	room	--	they	went	 up 	 stair 	 s 	 	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	!
that	child	was	 ver 	 y 	 	articulate	and	 show 	 ed 	 	us	and	even	 deal 	 t 	 	with	the	 thing 	 s 	 	he	could	n't	do	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	with	that	manual	.	it	was	just	 absolute 	 ly 	 	fantastic	.	``
the	principal	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	there	's	a	 dread 	 ful 	 	 mistak 	 e 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	child	ca	n't	read	.
and	you	 obvious 	 ly 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	hoodwinked	or	you	've	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	 some 	 body 	 	else	.	``
and	they	all	got	up	and	they	all	went	 down 	 stair 	 s 	 
and	the	child	was	still	there	.	and	they	did	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	intelligent	:	they	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	child	,	``	can	you	read	?	``
and	the	child	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	i	ca	n't	.	``
and	then	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	but	wait	a	minute	.	you	just	 look 	 ed 	 	through	that	manual	and	you	found	...	``	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	oh	,	but	that	's	not	 read 	 ing 	 	.	``
and	so	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	what	's	 read 	 ing 	 	then	?	``
he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	well	,	 read 	 ing 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	junk	they	give	me	in	little	 book 	 s 	 	to	read	.
it	's	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 ir 	 relevant 	 	,	and	i	get	 noth 	 ing 	 	for	it	.
but	here	,	with	a	little	bit	of	effort	i	get	a	lot	of	return	.	``
and	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	to	the	child	.
the	child	read	 beaut 	 i 	 fully 	 	,	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	,	and	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 compete 	 nt 	 	.	so	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	.
and	that	story	 ha 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	other	 anecdote 	 s 	 	that	are	similar	,	but	 w 	 ow 	 	.	the	key	to	the	future	of	 computer 	 s 	 	in	education	is	right	there	,
and	it	is	:	when	 do 	 es 	 	it	mean	 some 	 thing 	 	to	a	child	?
there	is	a	myth	,	and	it	 tru 	 ly 	 	is	a	myth	:	we	 believ 	 e 	 	--	and	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	a	lot	of	you	 believ 	 e 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	--	that	it	is	 hard 	 er 	 	to	read	and	write	than	it	is	to	learn	how	to	speak	.
and	it	's	not	,	but	we	think	speech	--	``	my	god	,	little	children	pick	it	up	 some 	 how 	 	,
and	by	the	age	of	two	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	a	 mediocr 	 e 	 	job	,
and	by	three	and	four	they	're	 s 	 peaking 	 	 reason 	 ably 	 	well	.
and	yet	you	've	got	to	go	to	school	to	learn	how	to	read	,
and	you	have	to	 s 	 it 	 	in	a	 class 	 room 	 	and	 some 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	teach	you	.	 h 	 ence 	 	,	it	must	be	 hard 	 er 	 	.	``	well	,	it	's	not	 hard 	 er 	 	.
what	the	truth	is	is	that	 s 	 peaking 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	great	value	to	a	child	;
the	child	can	get	a	great	deal	by	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	you	.
 read 	 ing 	 	and	writing	is	 utter 	 ly 	 	 use 	 less 	 	.
there	is	no	reason	for	a	child	to	read	and	write	 ex 	 cept 	 	blind	faith	,	and	that	it	's	going	to	help	you	.
so	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	you	go	to	school	and	people	say	,	``	just	 believ 	 e 	 	me	,	you	're	going	to	like	it	.
you	're	going	to	like	 read 	 ing 	 	,	``	and	just	read	and	read	.
on	the	other	hand	,	you	give	a	kid	--	a	three	-	year	-	old	kid	--	a	computer
and	they	type	a	little	command	and	--	poof	!	--	 some 	 thing 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	.
and	all	of	a	sudden	...	you	may	not	call	that	 read 	 ing 	 	and	writing	,	but	a	certain	bit	of	 ty 	 ping 	 	and	 read 	 ing 	 	stuff	on	the	screen	 ha 	 s 	 	a	huge	 pay 	 off 	 	,	and	it	's	a	lot	of	 f 	 un 	 	.
and	in	fact	,	it	's	a	 power 	 ful 	 	 education 	 al 	 	instrument	.
well	,	in	senegal	we	found	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	 class 	 room 	 	:	120	 kid 	 s 	 	--	three	per	desk	--	one	teacher	,	a	little	bit	of	chalk	.
 th 	 is 	 	student	was	one	of	our	first	 student 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	the	girl	on	the	left	 lean 	 ing 	 	with	her	 chalk 	 board 	 	,
and	she	came	...	 with 	 in 	 	two	 day 	 s 	 	--	i	want	to	show	you	the	program	she	wrote	,	and	remember	her	hairstyle	.	and	that	is	the	program	she	made	.
that	's	what	 me 	 ant 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	to	her	,	is	 do 	 ing 	 	the	hair	pattern	,	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	did	it	 with 	 in 	 	two	 day 	 s 	 	--	an	hour	each	day	--	and	found	it	was	,	to	her	,	 absolute 	 ly 	 	the	most	 meaning 	 ful 	 	piece	...
but	 root 	 ed 	 	in	that	,	little	did	she	know	how	much	knowledge	she	was	 acquir 	 ing 	 	about	 geo 	 metry 	 	and	just	math	and	logic	and	all	the	rest	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	i	could	talk	for	three	 hour 	 s 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	subject	.
i	will	come	to	my	last	 ex 	 ample 	 	and	then	quit	.
and	my	last	 ex 	 ample 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	some	of	my	 form 	 er 	 	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	,	whom	i	see	in	the	room	,	can	imagine	what	it	will	be	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	it	is	.	it	's	our	work	--	that	was	a	while	ago	,	and	it	still	is	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	project	--	of	teleconferencing	.
and	the	reason	it	 remain 	 s 	 	a	 favor 	 ite 	 	project	is	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	do	a	teleconferencing	system	where	you	had	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	:	you	had	five	people	at	five	different	 s 	 ites 	 	--	they	 we 	 re 	 	known	people	--
and	you	had	to	have	these	people	in	teleconference	,	 s 	 uch 	 	that	each	one	was	 utter 	 ly 	 	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	that	the	other	four	 we 	 re 	 	 physical 	 ly 	 	present	.
now	,	that	is	 sufficient 	 ly 	 	 z 	 any 	 	that	we	would	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	jump	to	the	bait	,	and	we	did	.
and	the	fact	that	we	 k 	 new 	 	the	people	--	we	had	to	take	a	page	out	of	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	walt	disney	--
we	 actual 	 ly 	 	went	so	far	 a 	 s 	 	to	build	crts	in	the	 shape 	 s 	 	of	the	people	's	 face 	 s 	 	.
so	if	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	call	my	friend	peter	sprague	on	the	phone	,	my	 secret 	 ary 	 	would	get	his	head	out	and	 br 	 ing 	 	it	and	set	it	on	the	desk	,
and	that	would	be	the	tv	used	for	the	occasion	.
and	it	's	 un 	 can 	 ny 	 	:	there	's	no	way	i	can	explain	to	you	the	amount	of	eye	contact	you	get	with	that	physical	face	 project 	 ed 	 	on	a	3d	crt	of	that	sort	.
the	next	thing	that	we	had	to	do	is	to	 persuad 	 e 	 	them	that	there	 need 	 ed 	 	to	be	spatial	 correspond 	 ence 	 	,	which	is	 straight 	 forward 	 	,	but	 aga 	 in 	 	,	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	did	n't	fall	 natural 	 ly 	 	out	of	a	 tele 	 communication 	 s 	 	or	computing	style	of	 think 	 ing 	 	;
it	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	if	you	will	,	 architect 	 ural 	 	or	spatial	 con 	 cept 	 	.	and	that	was	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	that	when	you	 s 	 it 	 	around	the	table	,	the	actual	location	of	the	people	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
and	when	 some 	 body 	 	 get 	 s 	 	up	,	in	fact	,	to	go	answer	a	phone	or	use	a	 bath 	 room 	 	or	 some 	 thing 	 	,	the	empty	seat	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	,	if	you	will	,	that	person	.	and	you	point	 frequent 	 ly 	 	to	the	empty	seat	and	you	say	,	``	he	or	she	would	n't	agree	,	``
and	the	empty	chair	is	that	person	and	the	spatiality	is	 cruci 	 al 	 	.
so	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	these	will	be	on	round	 table 	 s 	 	and	the	order	around	the	table	had	to	be	the	same	,
so	that	at	my	 s 	 ite 	 	,	i	would	be	,	if	you	will	,	real
and	then	at	each	other	's	 s 	 ite 	 	you	'd	have	these	plastic	 head 	 s 	 	.
and	the	plastic	 head 	 s 	 	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	you	want	to	project	them	.	and	there	are	a	number	of	 scheme 	 s 	 	,	which	i	do	n't	want	to	 d 	 well 	 	on	,
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	one	that	we	 final 	 ly 	 	used	where	we	 project 	 ed 	 	onto	rear	screen	material	that	was	 mold 	 ed 	 	in	the	face	--	 liter 	 ally 	 	in	the	face	of	the	person	.
and	i	'll	show	you	one	more	slide	,	where	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	made	from	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	a	solid	photograph	and	is	the	screen	.
now	,	we	track	,	on	the	person	's	head	,	the	head	 motion 	 s 	 	--
so	we	transmit	with	a	video	the	head	 position 	 s 	 	--
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	head	 move 	 s 	 	in	about	two	 axe 	 s 	 	.
so	if	i	,	all	of	a	sudden	,	turn	to	the	person	to	my	left	and	start	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	that	person	,	then	at	the	person	to	my	right	's	 s 	 ite 	 	,	he	'll	see	these	two	plastic	 head 	 s 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	each	other	.
and	then	if	that	person	 interrupt 	 s 	 	,	then	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 head 	 s 	 	may	turn	.
and	it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	 re 	 construct 	 ing 	 	,	 quit 	 e 	 	 accurate 	 ly 	 	,	teleconferencing	.
