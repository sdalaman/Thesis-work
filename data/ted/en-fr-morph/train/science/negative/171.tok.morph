three	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	got	a	phone	call	,	based	on	an	 ear 	 lier 	 	film	i	had	made	,	with	an	 off 	 er 	 	to	embed	the	new	hampshire	national	guard	.
my	idea	--	and	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	i	 wok 	 e 	 	up	in	the	middle	of	the	night	,	and	we	've	all	have	 t 	 hose 	 	 moment 	 s 	 	.	you	know	,	you	go	to	sleep	--
i	was	 excit 	 ed 	 	,	with	 th 	 is 	 	phone	call	.
i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	,	i	just	 finish 	 ed 	 	making	 an 	 other 	 	film	about	world	war	ii	 vet 	 s 	 	,	and	i	 real 	 ized 	 	i	'd	gotten	to	know	 the 	 ir 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	,	and	i	 real 	 ized 	 	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	once	-	in	-	a	-	 life 	 time 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	tell	a	warrior	's	story	 a 	 s 	 	it	 un 	 fold 	 ed 	 	.
so	i	went	to	bed	that	night	 pre 	 tty 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	.
not	 s 	 ure 	 	of	all	the	 detail 	 s 	 	,	but	 excit 	 ed 	 	.
it	was	n't	at	four	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	but	it	was	 close 	 r 	 	to	 mid 	 night 	 	.
 wok 	 e 	 	straight	up	.	wide	-	awake	 a 	 s 	 	could	be	.
and	i	had	 th 	 is 	 	idea	:	what	if	i	could	,	in	effect	,	 virtual 	 ly 	 	embed	,
and	create	a	 perm 	 e 	 able 	 	relationship	with	the	 soldier 	 s 	 	?
to	tell	the	story	from	the	 in 	 side 	 	out	,	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	the	 out 	 side 	 	in	?
so	,	i	 call 	 ed 	 	back	major	heilshorn	,	who	's	the	public	 af 	 fair 	 s 	 	officer	of	the	new	hampshire	national	guard	.
and	he	 k 	 new 	 	me	,	so	i	was	like	,	``	greg	?	``
he	's	like	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	deborah	?	``
told	him	my	idea	,	and	you	know	,	he	is	one	of	the	 brave 	 st 	 	men	in	the	world	,	 a 	 s 	 	is	general	blair	,	who	,	in	the	end	,	 g 	 ave 	 	me	 per 	 mission 	 	to	try	 th 	 is 	 	experiment	.
 with 	 in 	 	10	 day 	 s 	 	,	i	was	down	at	fort	dix	.
he	 g 	 ave 	 	me	my	pick	of	 unit 	 s 	 	.
i	 pick 	 ed 	 	one	unit	--	charlie	company	,	third	of	the	172nd	,	they	're	mountain	 infant 	 ry 	 	--	for	two	 reason 	 s 	 	.
one	,	they	're	 infant 	 ry 	 	.
number	two	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	be	based	at	lsa	anaconda	,	so	i	 k 	 new 	 	they	would	have	 inter 	 net 	 	access	.
the	 cave 	 at 	 	for	my	access	was	i	had	to	get	the	 soldier 	 s 	 	to	volunteer	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	big	thing	that
i	think	when	major	h	told	me	,	i	was	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 total 	 ly 	 	 gather 	 ing 	 	what	that	would	mean	.
so	what	that	 me 	 ant 	 	was	,	when	i	went	down	to	fort	dix	,	i	had	to	hop	out	in	front	of	180	 guy 	 s 	 	and	tell	them	of	my	vision	.
you	can	imagine	the	 hail 	 storm 	 	of	 question 	 s 	 	i	got	.
the	 open 	 ing 	 	one	was	,	``	what	the	fuck	do	you	know	about	the	national	guard	?	``
i	 start 	 ed 	 	with	the	1607	massachusetts	 ba 	 y 	 	 colon 	 y 	 	pequot	indian	 war 	 s 	 	.
 g 	 ave 	 	them	about	a	nine	minute	 respons 	 e 	 	,	and	there	we	went	.

so	,	i	want	to	show	the	 trail 	 er 	 	,	and	then	i	'm	going	to	take	 a 	 part 	 	one	scene	in	detail	.

there	are	three	 feature 	 d 	 	in	the	film	.
the	way	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	about	taji	was	steve	pink	 s 	 ent 	 	me	an	email	,	and	in	it	,	 attach 	 ed 	 	a	photo	of	that	 burn 	 ed 	 	body	out	at	the	car	.
and	the	tone	from	the	email	was	,	you	know	,	it	had	 be 	 en 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	bad	day	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	.
and	i	saw	in	my	im	window	that	 mi 	 ke 	 	moriarty	was	at	the	base	.
so	,	i	 ping 	 ed 	 	 mi 	 ke 	 	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 mi 	 ke 	 	,	can	you	 pleas 	 e 	 	go	get	that	interview	with	pink	?	``
 be 	 cause 	 	the	thing	that	 ver 	 y 	 	often	is	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	is	,	in	the	 militar 	 y 	 	what	they	call	``	hot	wash	.	``
it	's	that	 im 	 mediate 	 	interview	after	 some 	 thing 	 	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	,	you	know	.
and	if	you	let	time	go	by	,	it	kind	of	 s 	 often 	 s 	 	and	 smooth 	 s 	 	the	 edge 	 s 	 	.
and	for	me	,	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	that	.
so	,	in	order	to	get	the	 in 	 timacy 	 	,	to	share	that	experience	with	you	,	the	 guy 	 s 	 	--	the	two	most	popular	 mount 	 s 	 	--	there	was	a	camera	on	the	 tur 	 ret 	 	,	the	gun	 tur 	 ret 	 	,	and	then	on	the	 dash 	 board 	 	of	the	humvee	.
most	of	the	humvees	,	we	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 mount 	 ing 	 	two	 camera 	 s 	 	in	them	.
so	you	get	to	experience	that	in	real	time	,	right	?
the	interview	that	you	see	is	the	one	that	 mi 	 ke 	 	went	and	did	 with 	 in 	 	24	 hour 	 s 	 	of	that	episode	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
steve	pink	 read 	 ing 	 	his	journal	 happen 	 ed 	 	five	 month 	 s 	 	after	he	came	home	.
i	 k 	 new 	 	about	that	journal	,	but	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	private	.
and	you	know	,	you	earn	 some 	 one 	 	's	trust	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	in	doc	 film 	 making 	 	,	through	your	relationship	.
so	,	it	was	n't	 un 	 til 	 	five	 month 	 s 	 	after	he	was	home	that	he	would	read	that	journal	.
now	,	the	news	 foot 	 age 	 	i	put	in	there	to	try	to	show	--	you	know	,	i	think	 main 	 stream 	 	media	tries	to	do	the	best	they	can	in	the	format	that	they	have	.
but	the	thing	that	i	know	you	all	have	heard	a	lot	of	 time 	 s 	 	,	american	 soldier 	 s 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	why	do	n't	they	talk	about	the	good	stuff	that	we	do	?	``
ok	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	perfect	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
pink	's	 s 	 quad 	 	and	 an 	 other 	 	 s 	 quad 	 	 s 	 pent 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	entire	day	 out 	 side 	 	the	wire	.
they	did	n't	have	to	go	 out 	 side 	 	the	wire	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	not	americans	hurt	out	there	.
they	 s 	 pent 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	entire	day	 out 	 side 	 	the	wire	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 s 	 ave 	 	iraqi	 live 	 s 	 	--	the	iraqis	who	work	on	the	post	.
so	,	when	you	may	hear	 soldier 	 s 	 	 complain 	 ing 	 	,	that	's	what	they	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	,	you	know	?
and	i	think	it	's	 s 	 uch 	 	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	gift	that	they	would	share	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	way	of	 brid 	 ging 	 	.
and	when	i	talk	about	that	 polar 	 ity 	 	i	get	at	so	 man 	 y 	 	different	q	&	 a 	 s 	 	,	and	people	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 opinion 	 ated 	 	.
but	it	 seem 	 s 	 	like	people	do	n't	want	to	hear	so	much	,
or	listen	,	or	try	to	have	an	 ex 	 change 	 	.
and	i	'm	 a 	 s 	 	 fi 	 ery 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	next	person	,	but	i	 re 	 ally 	 	think	--	you	know	,	different	 speaker 	 s 	 	have	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	 the 	 ir 	 	concern	for	the	world	,	and	my	concern	is	that	we	have	to	have	these	 conversation 	 s 	 	.
and	we	have	to	be	able	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	 scar 	 y 	 	 place 	 s 	 	where	we	may	,	you	know	,	we	think	we	know	.
but	we	just	have	to	 leav 	 e 	 	that	little	bit	of	 open 	 ness 	 	,	to	know	.
there	's	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 dis 	 connect 	 	.
and	for	me	,	it	's	 try 	 ing 	 	to	bridge	that	 dis 	 connect 	 	.
i	'll	share	one	story	.
i	get	--	i	'm	often	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	you	know	,	for	me	,	what	have	 be 	 en 	 	some	of	the	special	 moment 	 s 	 	from	 hav 	 ing 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	film	.
and	at	 screen 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	 inevit 	 ably 	 	--	you	know	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	all	of	you	 obvious 	 ly 	 	do	 s 	 peaking 	 	stuff	--	 usual 	 ly 	 	you	have	people	who	hang	around	and	want	to	ask	you	more	 question 	 s 	 	.
and	 usual 	 ly 	 	,	the	first	 question 	 s 	 	are	,	``	oh	,	what	kind	of	 camera 	 s 	 	did	you	use	?	``
or	you	know	,	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
but	there	's	 al 	 ways 	 	a	few	 guy 	 s 	 	,	 al 	 most 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	,	who	are	the	last	 one 	 s 	 	.
and	i	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	over	time	that	 t 	 hose 	 	are	 al 	 ways 	 	the	 soldier 	 s 	 	.
and	they	wait	 un 	 til 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 every 	 body 	 	's	gone	.
and	for	me	,	one	of	the	most	 pro 	 found 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	 some 	 one 	 	 share 	 d 	 	with	me	,	that	then	 be 	 came 	 	my	story	,	was	--	for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	have	n't	 s 	 een 	 	the	film	,	and	it	's	not	a	 spoil 	 er 	 	--	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	common	there	are	a	lot	of	 civil 	 ian 	 	 accident 	 s 	 	,	where	people	get	in	front	of	humvees	and	they	get	 kill 	 ed 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	film	,	there	is	a	scene	where	an	iraqi	woman	is	 kill 	 ed 	 	.
a	soldier	came	up	to	me	and	stood	,	you	know	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 pre 	 tty 	 	close	,	a	foot	away	from	me	.
he	's	a	big	guy	.
and	he	 look 	 ed 	 	at	me	,	and	i	 smil 	 ed 	 	,	and	then	i	saw	the	 tear 	 s 	 	start	 well 	 ing 	 	up	in	his	 eye 	 s 	 	.
and	he	was	n't	going	to	blink	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	my	 gun 	 ner 	 	was	 throw 	 ing 	 	 can 	 dy 	 	.	``
and	i	 k 	 new 	 	what	he	was	going	to	say	.
the	 gun 	 ner 	 	was	 throw 	 ing 	 	 can 	 dy 	 	.
they	used	to	throw	 can 	 dy 	 	to	the	 kid 	 s 	 	.
 kid 	 s 	 	got	too	close	,	 ver 	 y 	 	often	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	 kill 	 ed 	 	a	child	.
and	i	'm	a	father	.	i	have	children	.
i	have	n't	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	tell	my	wife	.
i	'm	 af 	 raid 	 	she	's	going	to	think	i	'm	a	 mon 	 ster 	 	.	``
i	 hugg 	 ed 	 	him	,	of	course	,	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	you	know	,	``	it	's	going	to	be	ok	.	``
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'm	going	to	 br 	 ing 	 	her	to	see	your	film	.
and	then	i	'm	going	to	tell	her	.	``
so	when	i	talk	about	a	 dis 	 connect 	 	,	it	's	not	 on 	 ly 	 	for	 may 	 be 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	people	who	do	n't	know	a	soldier	,
which	there	 obvious 	 ly 	 	are	.	you	know	,	these	 day 	 s 	 	,
it	's	not	like	world	war	ii	,	where	there	was	a	war	front	and	a	home	front	,	and	 every 	 body 	 	 seem 	 ed 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	.
you	can	go	for	 day 	 s 	 	here	and	not	feel	like	there	's	a	war	going	on	.
and	often	,	i	'll	hear	people	say	,	who	 may 	 be 	 	know	that	i	did	 th 	 is 	 	film	,	and	they	say	,	``	oh	,	you	know	,	i	'm	against	the	war	,	but	i	support	the	 soldier 	 s 	 	.	``
and	i	've	 start 	 ed 	 	to	ask	them	,	``	well	,	that	's	nice	.	what	are	you	 do 	 ing 	 	?
are	you	 volunteer 	 ing 	 	at	a	va	?
you	go	and	see	 any 	 body 	 	?
do	you	,	if	you	find	out	your	neighbor	's	 be 	 en 	 	,	do	you	 s 	 pend 	 	some	time	?
not	 necess 	 arily 	 	ask	 question 	 s 	 	,	but	see	if	they	want	to	talk	?
do	you	give	money	to	any	of	the	 char 	 ities 	 	?	``
you	know	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	like	dean	kamen	's	 work 	 ing 	 	on	that	 amaz 	 ing 	 	thing	,	but	there	's	 char 	 ities 	 	where	you	can	sponsor	 computer 	 s 	 	for	 wound 	 ed 	 	 soldier 	 s 	 	.
i	think	,	i	 challeng 	 e 	 	us	to	say	--	to	 operation 	 al 	 ize 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 term 	 s 	 	,	when	we	say	we	support	 some 	 one 	 	,	you	know	?
are	you	a	friend	to	them	?
do	you	 re 	 ally 	 	care	?
and	i	would	just	say	it	's	my	hope	,	and	i	would	ask	you	 guy 	 s 	 	to	 pleas 	 e 	 	,	you	know	,	reach	out	a	hand	.
and	 re 	 ally 	 	do	give	them	a	hug	.
thank	you	.
