thank	you	.
and	i	feel	like	 th 	 is 	 	whole	 even 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	to	me	.
i	feel	it	's	sort	of	like	the	vimalakirti	sutra	,	an	ancient	work	from	ancient	india	in	which	the	buddha	 appear 	 s 	 	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	and	a	whole	bunch	of	people	come	to	see	him	from	the	 big 	 gest 	 	city	in	the	area	,	vaishali	,	and	they	 br 	 ing 	 	some	sort	of	 jewel 	 ed 	 	 parasol 	 s 	 	to	make	an	 off 	 er 	 ing 	 	to	him	.
all	the	young	people	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	from	the	city	.	the	old	 fog 	 ey 	 s 	 	do	n't	come	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	mad	at	buddha	,	 be 	 cause 	 	when	he	came	to	 the 	 ir 	 	city	he	 accept 	 ed 	 	--	he	 al 	 ways 	 	 accept 	 s 	 	the	first	 invit 	 ation 	 	that	 come 	 s 	 	to	him	,	from	 who 	 ever 	 	it	is	,	and	the	local	 ge 	 ish 	 a 	 	,	a	movie	-	star	sort	of	person	,	 rac 	 ed 	 	the	 elder 	 s 	 	of	the	city	in	a	 cha 	 riot 	 	and	 invit 	 ed 	 	him	first	.
so	he	was	 hang 	 ing 	 	out	with	the	movie	star	,	and	of	course	they	 we 	 re 	 	 grum 	 bling 	 	:	``	he	's	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	religious	and	all	 th 	 is 	 	.
what	's	he	 do 	 ing 	 	over	there	at	amrapali	's	house	with	all	his	500	 monk 	 s 	 	,	``	and	so	on	.	they	 we 	 re 	 	all	 grum 	 bling 	 	,	and	so	they	 boycott 	 ed 	 	him	.
they	would	n't	go	listen	to	him	.
but	the	young	people	all	came	.
and	they	 br 	 ought 	 	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	a	 jewel 	 ed 	 	parasol	,	and	they	put	it	on	the	ground	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	they	had	laid	all	these	,	all	 the 	 ir 	 	big	stack	of	these	 jewel 	 ed 	 	 parasol 	 s 	 	that	they	used	to	carry	in	ancient	india	,	he	 perform 	 ed 	 	a	kind	of	special	effect	which	made	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	giant	 planet 	 arium 	 	,	the	wonder	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.	 every 	 one 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	in	that	,	and	they	saw	in	there	the	total	 interconnect 	 ed 	 ness 	 	of	all	life	in	all	 uni 	 verse 	 s 	 	.
and	of	course	,	in	the	buddhist	 cosmo 	 s 	 	there	are	 million 	 s 	 	and	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 planet 	 s 	 	with	human	life	on	it	,	and	 enlighten 	 ed 	 	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	can	see	the	life	on	all	the	other	 planet 	 s 	 	.
so	they	do	n't	--	when	they	look	out	and	they	see	 t 	 hose 	 	 light 	 s 	 	that	you	 show 	 ed 	 	in	the	sky	--	they	do	n't	just	see	sort	of	 piece 	 s 	 	of	matter	 burn 	 ing 	 	or	 rock 	 s 	 	or	 flame 	 s 	 	or	 gas 	 es 	 	 expl 	 o 	 d 	 ing 	 	.
they	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	 land 	 scapes 	 	and	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	 god 	 s 	 	and	 dragon 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 er 	 pent 	 	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	 goddess 	 es 	 	and	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	.
he	made	that	special	effect	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	get	 every 	 one 	 	to	think	about	 interconnect 	 ion 	 	and	 interconnect 	 ed 	 ness 	 	and	how	 every 	 thing 	 	in	life	was	 total 	 ly 	 	 interconnect 	 ed 	 	.
and	then	leilei	--	i	know	his	other	name	--	told	us	about	 interconnect 	 ion 	 	,	and	how	we	're	all	 total 	 ly 	 	 interconnect 	 ed 	 	here	,	and	how	we	've	all	known	each	other	.	and	of	course	in	the	buddhist	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	we	've	 al 	 ready 	 	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 time 	 s 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 life 	 time 	 s 	 	in	the	past	.
and	i	did	n't	give	the	talk	 al 	 ways 	 	.	you	did	,	and	we	had	to	watch	you	,	and	so	forth	.
and	we	're	all	still	 try 	 ing 	 	to	,	i	guess	we	're	all	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	tedsters	,	if	that	's	a	modern	form	of	 enlighten 	 ment 	 	.
i	guess	so	.	 be 	 cause 	 	in	a	way	,	if	a	tedster	 relat 	 es 	 	to	all	the	 interconnect 	 ed 	 ness 	 	of	all	the	 computer 	 s 	 	and	 every 	 thing 	 	,	it	's	the	 for 	 ging 	 	of	a	mass	 aware 	 ness 	 	,	of	where	 every 	 body 	 	can	 re 	 ally 	 	know	 every 	 thing 	 	that	's	going	on	 every 	 where 	 	in	the	planet	.
and	 there 	 fore 	 	it	will	 be 	 come 	 	 in 	 toler 	 able 	 	--	what	 compass 	 ion 	 	is	,	is	where	it	will	 be 	 come 	 	 in 	 toler 	 able 	 	for	us	,	 total 	 ly 	 	 in 	 toler 	 able 	 	that	we	 s 	 it 	 	here	in	comfort	and	in	pleasure	and	 enjoy 	 ing 	 	the	life	of	the	mind	or	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	,	and	there	are	people	who	are	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 riddle 	 d 	 	with	disease	and	they	can	not	have	a	bite	of	food	and	they	have	no	place	,	or	they	're	 be 	 ing 	 	 brutal 	 ized 	 	by	some	 terr 	 ible 	 	person	and	so	forth	.
it	just	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 in 	 toler 	 able 	 	.
with	all	of	us	 know 	 ing 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	,	we	're	kind	of	 force 	 d 	 	by	technology	to	 be 	 come 	 	buddhas	or	 some 	 thing 	 	,	to	 be 	 come 	 	 enlighten 	 ed 	 	.
and	of	course	,	we	all	will	be	 deep 	 ly 	 	 disappoint 	 ed 	 	when	we	do	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	think	that	 be 	 cause 	 	we	are	kind	of	 tire 	 d 	 	of	what	we	do	,	a	little	bit	 tire 	 d 	 	,	we	do	suffer	.
we	do	enjoy	our	 mis 	 ery 	 	in	a	certain	way	.
we	distract	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	from	our	 mis 	 ery 	 	by	running	around	 some 	 where 	 	,	but	 bas 	 ically 	 	we	all	have	 th 	 is 	 	common	 mis 	 ery 	 	that	we	are	sort	of	 s 	 tuck 	 	 in 	 side 	 	our	 skin 	 s 	 	and	 every 	 one 	 	else	is	out	there	.
and	 occasion 	 ally 	 	we	get	together	with	 an 	 other 	 	person	 s 	 tuck 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	skin	and	the	two	of	us	enjoy	each	other	,	and	each	one	tries	to	get	out	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	,	and	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	it	 fail 	 s 	 	of	course	,	and	then	we	're	back	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	thing	.
 be 	 cause 	 	our	 ego 	 centric 	 	 per 	 ception 	 	--	from	the	buddha	's	point	of	view	,	 mis 	 per 	 ception 	 	--	is	that	all	we	are	is	what	is	 in 	 side 	 	our	skin	.
and	it	's	 in 	 side 	 	and	 out 	 side 	 	,	self	and	other	,	and	other	is	all	 ver 	 y 	 	different	.
and	 every 	 one 	 	here	is	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	 carry 	 ing 	 	that	 habitu 	 al 	 	 per 	 ception 	 	,	a	little	bit	,	right	?
you	know	,	 some 	 one 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	next	to	you	in	a	seat	--	that	's	ok	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	in	a	theater	,	but	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	on	a	park	bench	and	 some 	 one 	 	came	up	and	 s 	 at 	 	that	close	to	you	,	you	'd	freak	out	.
what	do	they	want	from	me	?	like	,	who	's	that	?
and	so	you	would	n't	 s 	 it 	 	that	close	to	 an 	 other 	 	person	 be 	 cause 	 	of	your	 not 	 ion 	 	that	it	's	you	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	--	that	's	all	buddha	 discover 	 ed 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	that	 cosm 	 ic 	 	 bas 	 ic 	 	idea	that	it	is	us	all	 al 	 one 	 	,	each	of	us	,	and	 every 	 one 	 	else	is	different	,	then	that	 put 	 s 	 	us	in	an	 im 	 possible 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	 do 	 es 	 	n't	it	?
who	is	it	who	's	going	to	get	 en 	 ough 	 	attention	from	the	world	?
who	's	going	to	get	 en 	 ough 	 	out	of	the	world	?
who	's	not	going	to	be	 over 	 run 	 	by	an	infinite	number	of	other	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	--	if	you	're	different	from	all	the	other	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	?
so	where	 compass 	 ion 	 	 come 	 s 	 	is	where	you	 surprising 	 ly 	 	discover	you	lose	 your 	 self 	 	in	some	way	:	through	art	,	through	 medit 	 ation 	 	,	through	 understand 	 ing 	 	,	through	knowledge	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 know 	 ing 	 	that	you	have	no	 s 	 uch 	 	 bound 	 ary 	 	,	 know 	 ing 	 	your	 interconnect 	 ed 	 ness 	 	with	other	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
you	can	experience	 your 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	other	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	when	you	see	through	the	delusion	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 separat 	 ed 	 	from	them	.
when	you	do	that	,	you	're	 force 	 d 	 	to	feel	what	they	feel	.
 luck 	 ily 	 	,	they	say	--	i	still	am	not	 s 	 ure 	 	--	but	 luck 	 ily 	 	,	they	say	that	when	you	reach	that	point	 be 	 cause 	 	some	people	have	 s 	 aid 	 	in	the	buddhist	 liter 	 ature 	 	,	they	say	,	``	oh	who	would	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	be	 com 	 passionate 	 	?
how	awful	!	i	'm	so	 mis 	 er 	 able 	 	on	my	own	.	my	head	is	 ach 	 ing 	 	.
my	 bone 	 s 	 	are	 ach 	 ing 	 	.	i	go	from	birth	to	death	.	i	'm	never	satisfied	.
i	never	have	 en 	 ough 	 	,	even	if	i	'm	a	 billion 	 aire 	 	,	i	do	n't	have	 en 	 ough 	 	.
i	need	a	hundred	billion	.	``	so	i	'm	like	that	.
imagine	if	i	had	to	feel	even	a	hundred	other	people	's	 suffer 	 ing 	 	.
it	would	be	 terr 	 ible 	 	.
but	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	strange	paradox	of	life	.
when	you	're	no	 long 	 er 	 	 lock 	 ed 	 	in	 your 	 self 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	the	 wis 	 dom 	 	or	the	 intellig 	 ence 	 	or	the	scientific	knowledge	of	the	nature	of	the	world	,	that	 en 	 able 	 s 	 	you	to	let	your	mind	spread	out	,	and	 empath 	 ize 	 	,	and	enhance	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	human	ability	of	 empath 	 izing 	 	,	and	 real 	 izing 	 	that	you	are	the	other	 be 	 ing 	 	,	 some 	 how 	 	by	that	 open 	 ing 	 	,	you	can	see	the	 deep 	 er 	 	nature	of	life	.	and	you	can	,	you	get	away	from	 th 	 is 	 	 terr 	 ible 	 	iron	circle	of	i	,	me	,	me	,	mine	,	like	the	beatles	used	to	 s 	 ing 	 	.
you	know	,	we	 re 	 ally 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	in	the	'60s	.
too	bad	 no 	 body 	 	ever	 wok 	 e 	 	up	to	it	,	and	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	suppress	it	since	then	.
i	,	me	,	me	,	mine	.	it	's	like	a	perfect	song	,	that	song	.	a	perfect	 teach 	 ing 	 	.
but	when	we	're	 reliev 	 ed 	 	from	that	,	we	 some 	 how 	 	then	 be 	 come 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	all	the	other	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
and	we	feel	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	.	it	's	 total 	 ly 	 	strange	.
it	's	 total 	 ly 	 	strange	.
the	dalai	lama	 al 	 ways 	 	 like 	 s 	 	to	say	--	he	 say 	 s 	 	that	when	you	give	birth	in	your	mind	to	the	idea	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	you	 real 	 ize 	 	that	you	 your 	 self 	 	and	your	 pain 	 s 	 	and	 pleasure 	 s 	 	are	 final 	 ly 	 	too	small	a	theater	for	your	 intellig 	 ence 	 	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	too	 bor 	 ing 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	you	feel	like	 th 	 is 	 	or	like	that	,	or	what	,	you	know	--	and	the	more	you	focus	on	how	you	feel	,	by	the	way	,	the	 wo 	 rse 	 	it	 get 	 s 	 	.
like	,	even	when	you	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	good	time	,	when	is	the	good	time	over	?
the	good	time	is	over	when	you	think	,	how	good	is	it	?
and	then	it	's	never	good	 en 	 ough 	 	.
i	love	that	leilei	 s 	 aid 	 	that	the	way	of	 help 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	who	are	 suffer 	 ing 	 	 bad 	 ly 	 	on	the	physical	plane	or	on	other	 plane 	 s 	 	is	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	good	time	,	 do 	 ing 	 	it	by	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	good	time	.
i	think	the	dalai	lama	should	have	heard	that	.	i	wish	he	'd	 be 	 en 	 	there	to	hear	that	.
he	once	told	me	--	he	 look 	 ed 	 	kind	of	 s 	 ad 	 	;	he	 worri 	 es 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	about	the	 have 	 s 	 	and	have	-	nots	.
he	 look 	 ed 	 	a	little	 s 	 ad 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	well	,	a	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	they	went	and	took	 every 	 thing 	 	away	from	the	 have 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	the	big	 commun 	 ist 	 	 revolution 	 s 	 	,	russia	and	 chin 	 a 	 	and	so	forth	.
they	took	it	all	away	by	violence	,	 say 	 ing 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	give	it	to	 every 	 one 	 	,	and	then	they	 we 	 re 	 	even	 wo 	 rse 	 	.
they	did	n't	help	at	all	.
so	what	could	possibly	change	 th 	 is 	 	 terr 	 ible 	 	gap	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 open 	 ed 	 	up	in	the	world	 to 	 day 	 	?
and	so	then	he	 look 	 s 	 	at	me	.
so	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	you	know	,	you	're	all	in	 th 	 is 	 	 your 	 self 	 	.	you	teach	:	it	's	 gene 	 ros 	 ity 	 	,	``	was	all	i	could	think	of	.	what	is	virtue	?
but	of	course	,	what	you	 s 	 aid 	 	,	i	think	the	key	to	saving	the	world	,	the	key	to	 compass 	 ion 	 	is	that	it	is	more	 f 	 un 	 	.
it	should	be	 d 	 one 	 	by	 f 	 un 	 	.	 gene 	 ros 	 ity 	 	is	more	 f 	 un 	 	.	that	's	the	key	.
 every 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	the	wrong	idea	.	they	think	buddha	was	so	 bor 	 ing 	 	,	and	they	're	so	 surprise 	 d 	 	when	they	meet	dalai	lama	and	he	's	 fair 	 ly 	 	 jol 	 ly 	 	.
even	 th 	 ough 	 	his	people	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 genocide 	 d 	 	--	and	 believ 	 e 	 	me	,	he	 feel 	 s 	 	every	blow	on	every	old	 n 	 un 	 	's	head	,	in	every	chinese	 pri 	 son 	 	.	he	 feel 	 s 	 	it	.
he	 feel 	 s 	 	the	way	they	are	 harvest 	 ing 	 	 yak 	 s 	 	 now 	 a 	 day 	 s 	 	.
i	wo	n't	even	say	what	they	do	.	but	he	 feel 	 s 	 	it	.
and	yet	he	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 jol 	 ly 	 	.	he	's	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 jol 	 ly 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	when	you	open	up	like	that	,	then	you	ca	n't	just	--	what	good	 do 	 es 	 	it	do	to	add	 be 	 ing 	 	 mis 	 er 	 able 	 	with	 other 	 s 	 	'	 mis 	 ery 	 	?
you	have	to	find	some	vision	where	you	see	how	 hope 	 ful 	 	it	is	,	how	it	can	be	 change 	 d 	 	.
look	at	that	 beaut 	 iful 	 	thing	chiho	 show 	 ed 	 	us	.	she	 scar 	 ed 	 	us	with	the	lava	man	.
she	 scar 	 ed 	 	us	with	the	lava	man	is	coming	,	then	the	tsunami	is	coming	,	but	then	 final 	 ly 	 	there	 we 	 re 	 	 flower 	 s 	 	and	 tree 	 s 	 	,	and	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 love 	 ly 	 	.
so	,	 compass 	 ion 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	to	feel	the	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	 other 	 s 	 	,	and	the	human	 be 	 ing 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	is	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
the	human	 be 	 ing 	 	is	 al 	 most 	 	out	of	time	.
the	human	 be 	 ing 	 	is	 compass 	 ion 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	what	is	our	brain	for	?
now	,	jim	's	brain	is	 memor 	 izing 	 	the	almanac	.
but	he	could	 memor 	 ize 	 	all	the	 need 	 s 	 	of	all	the	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	that	he	is	,	he	will	,	he	did	.
he	could	 memor 	 ize 	 	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	fantastic	 thing 	 s 	 	to	help	 man 	 y 	 	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
and	he	would	have	tremendous	 f 	 un 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	that	.
so	the	first	person	who	 get 	 s 	 	happy	,	when	you	stop	 focus 	 ing 	 	on	the	self	-	 center 	 ed 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	of	,	how	happy	am	i	,	where	you	're	 al 	 ways 	 	 dis 	 satisfied 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	mick	jagger	told	us	.	you	never	get	any	satisfaction	that	way	.
so	then	you	decide	,	``	well	,	i	'm	sick	of	 my 	 self 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	think	of	how	other	people	can	be	happy	.
i	'm	going	to	get	up	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	and	think	,	what	can	i	do	for	even	one	other	person	,	even	a	dog	,	my	dog	,	my	cat	,	my	pet	,	my	 butter 	 fly 	 	?	``
and	the	first	person	who	 get 	 s 	 	happy	when	you	do	that	,	you	do	n't	do	 any 	 thing 	 	for	 any 	 body 	 	else	,	but	you	get	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	,	you	 your 	 self 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	your	whole	 per 	 ception 	 	 broad 	 en 	 s 	 	and	you	 sudden 	 ly 	 	see	the	whole	world	and	all	of	the	people	in	it	.
and	you	 real 	 ize 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	--	 be 	 ing 	 	with	these	people	--	is	the	flower	garden	that	chiho	 show 	 ed 	 	us	.
it	is	nirvana	.
and	my	time	is	up	.	and	i	know	the	ted	 command 	 ments 	 	.
thank	you	.
