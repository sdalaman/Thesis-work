our	face	is	 huge 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	the	external	,	visual	part	that	 every 	 body 	 	else	 s 	 ees 	 	.
let	's	not	forget	it	's	a	functional	 ent 	 ity 	 	.
we	have	strong	skull	 bone 	 s 	 	that	protect	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	organ	in	our	body	:	the	brain	.
it	's	where	our	 sense 	 s 	 	are	 locate 	 d 	 	,	our	special	 sense 	 s 	 	--	our	vision	,	our	speech	,	our	 hear 	 ing 	 	,	our	smell	,	our	taste	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	bone	is	 pepper 	 ed 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	with	the	light	 shin 	 ing 	 	through	the	skull	with	 cav 	 ities 	 	,	the	 s 	 in 	 uses 	 	,	which	warm	and	 moist 	 en 	 	the	air	we	breathe	.
but	 al 	 so 	 	imagine	if	they	 we 	 re 	 	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	solid	bone	--	our	head	would	be	dead	weight	,	we	would	n't	be	able	to	hold	it	erect	,	we	would	n't	be	able	to	look	at	the	world	around	us	.
 th 	 is 	 	woman	is	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	 dy 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	benign	 tumor 	 s 	 	in	her	 fa 	 cial 	 	 bone 	 s 	 	have	 complete 	 ly 	 	 oblite 	 rated 	 	her	mouth	and	her	nose	so	she	ca	n't	breathe	and	eat	.
 attach 	 ed 	 	to	the	 fa 	 cial 	 	 bone 	 s 	 	that	define	our	face	's	structure	are	the	 muscle 	 s 	 	that	deliver	our	 fa 	 cial 	 	 express 	 ion 	 	,	our	universal	language	of	 express 	 ion 	 	,	our	social	-	 signal 	 ing 	 	system	.
and	 over 	 ly 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	skin	 d 	 rape 	 	,	which	is	a	 huge 	 ly 	 	complex	three	-	dimensional	structure	--	taking	right	-	angled	 bend 	 s 	 	here	and	there	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	thin	 area 	 s 	 	like	the	 eye 	 lids 	 	,	thick	 area 	 s 	 	like	the	cheek	,	different	 color 	 s 	 	.
and	then	we	have	the	sensual	factor	of	the	face	.
where	do	we	like	to	kiss	people	?
on	the	lips	.	nibble	the	 ear 	 s 	 	 may 	 be 	 	.
it	's	the	face	where	we	're	 attract 	 ed 	 	to	with	that	.
but	let	's	not	forget	the	hair	.
you	're	looking	at	the	image	on	your	left	-	hand	side	--	that	's	my	son	with	his	 eye 	 brow 	 s 	 	present	.
look	how	odd	he	 look 	 s 	 	with	the	 eye 	 brow 	 s 	 	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	.
there	's	a	definite	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
and	imagine	if	he	had	hair	 sprout 	 ing 	 	from	the	middle	of	his	nose	,	he	'd	look	even	 odd 	 er 	 	still	.
 dy 	 s 	 morpho 	 phobia 	 	is	an	 extrem 	 e 	 	version	of	the	fact	that	we	do	n't	see	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 other 	 s 	 	see	us	.
it	's	a	 shock 	 ing 	 	truth	that	we	 on 	 ly 	 	see	mirror	 image 	 s 	 	of	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	and	we	 on 	 ly 	 	see	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	freeze	-	frame	 photograph 	 ic 	 	 image 	 s 	 	that	capture	a	mere	fraction	of	the	time	that	we	live	.	 dy 	 s 	 morpho 	 phobia 	 	is	a	 per 	 version 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	where	people	who	may	be	 ver 	 y 	 	good	looking	regard	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 hide 	 ously 	 	 ug 	 ly 	 	and	are	 constant 	 ly 	 	seeking	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	to	correct	 the 	 ir 	 	 fa 	 cial 	 	 appear 	 ance 	 	.
they	do	n't	need	 th 	 is 	 	.	they	need	 psych 	 iatric 	 	help	.

after	the	 fa 	 cial 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	,	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	my	face	now	 reflect 	 s 	 	my	 personal 	 ity 	 	.

and	that	's	the	change	that	can	be	 achiev 	 ed 	 	for	 teenager 	 s 	 	.
is	 th 	 is 	 	change	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	a	real	change	,	or	is	it	a	 fig 	 ment 	 	of	the	 imagin 	 ation 	 	of	the	patient	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	?

when	people	get	 old 	 er 	 	,	they	do	n't	 necess 	 arily 	 	 choos 	 e 	 	to	follow	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	.
 the 	 ir 	 	presence	in	the	 consult 	 ation 	 	 suit 	 e 	 	is	a	result	of	the	 s 	 ling 	 s 	 	and	 arrow 	 s 	 	of	 out 	 rage 	 ous 	 	fortune	.

he	 look 	 s 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	at	 th 	 is 	 	stage	.

i	 learn 	 ed 	 	a	huge	amount	from	henry	.
henry	taught	me	that	you	can	carry	on	 work 	 ing 	 	.
he	 work 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	 advoc 	 ate 	 	.	he	 continu 	 ed 	 	to	play	cricket	.
he	 enjoy 	 ed 	 	life	to	the	full	,
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	 prob 	 ably 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	he	had	a	 success 	 ful 	 	,	 fulfill 	 ing 	 	job	and	a	 car 	 ing 	 	family	and	was	able	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	 social 	 ly 	 	.
he	 maintain 	 ed 	 	a	calm	 insouci 	 ance 	 	.
i	do	n't	say	he	 over 	 came 	 	 th 	 is 	 	;	he	did	n't	 over 	 come 	 	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	 some 	 thing 	 	more	than	that	.	he	 ignor 	 ed 	 	it	.
he	 ignor 	 ed 	 	the	 dis 	 figure 	 ment 	 	that	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	his	life	and	carried	on	 obliv 	 ious 	 	to	it	.
and	that	's	what	these	people	can	do	.
henriapi	 illustr 	 ates 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 phenomen 	 on 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	man	in	his	20s	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	first	visit	out	of	nigeria	was	with	 th 	 is 	 	 malign 	 ant 	 	cancer	that	he	came	to	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 king 	 dom 	 	to	have	 oper 	 ated 	 	on	.
it	was	my	 long 	 est 	 	operation	.
it	took	23	 hour 	 s 	 	.	i	did	it	with	my	 neuro 	 surgeon 	 	.	we	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	all	the	 bone 	 s 	 	at	the	right	side	of	his	face	--	his	eye	,	his	nose	,	the	skull	 bone 	 s 	 	,	the	 fa 	 cial 	 	skin	--	and	 re 	 construct 	 ed 	 	him	with	tissue	from	the	back	.
he	 continu 	 ed 	 	to	work	 a 	 s 	 	a	 psych 	 iatric 	 	nurse	.
he	got	married	.	he	had	a	son	 call 	 ed 	 	jeremiah	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 	of	me	with	my	son	jeremiah	 show 	 s 	 	me	 a 	 s 	 	the	 success 	 ful 	 	man	that	i	feel	that	i	am.	``
his	 fa 	 cial 	 	 dis 	 figure 	 ment 	 	did	not	affect	him	 be 	 cause 	 	he	had	the	support	of	a	family	;	he	had	a	 success 	 ful 	 	,	 fulfill 	 ing 	 	job	.
so	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	that	we	can	change	people	's	 face 	 s 	 	.
but	when	we	change	people	's	 face 	 s 	 	,	are	we	changing	 the 	 ir 	 	 ident 	 ity 	 	--	for	better	or	for	 wo 	 rse 	 	?
for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	there	are	two	different	 type 	 s 	 	of	 fa 	 cial 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	.
we	can	 categor 	 ize 	 	it	like	that	.
we	can	say	there	are	 patient 	 s 	 	who	 choos 	 e 	 	to	have	 fa 	 cial 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	--	like	 s 	 ue 	 	.
when	they	have	 fa 	 cial 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	,	they	feel	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	have	 change 	 d 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	other	people	perceive	them	 a 	 s 	 	better	people	.
they	do	n't	feel	different	.
they	feel	that	they	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	 gain 	 ed 	 	what	they	never	had	,	that	 the 	 ir 	 	face	now	 reflect 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 personal 	 ity 	 	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	that	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	cosmetic	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	and	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	you	might	say	,	``	well	,	 th 	 is 	 	type	of	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	might	be	 regard 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	cosmetic	.	``
if	you	do	cosmetic	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	,	 patient 	 s 	 	are	often	less	happy	.
they	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
 s 	 ue 	 	was	n't	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	her	life	.	she	was	just	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	the	face	that	 match 	 ed 	 	her	 personal 	 ity 	 	.
but	then	we	have	other	people	who	do	n't	 choos 	 e 	 	to	have	 fa 	 cial 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	.
they	're	people	who	have	 the 	 ir 	 	face	shot	off	.
i	'll	move	it	off	,	and	we	'll	have	a	blank	slide	for	 t 	 hose 	 	who	are	 squeam 	 ish 	 	 among 	 st 	 	you	.
they	have	it	 force 	 d 	 	 up 	 on 	 	them	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	told	you	,	if	they	have	a	 car 	 ing 	 	family	and	good	work	life	,	then	they	can	lead	normal	and	 fulfill 	 ed 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
 the 	 ir 	 	 ident 	 ity 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	change	.
is	 th 	 is 	 	business	a	western	 phenomen 	 on 	 	?
muzetta	's	family	give	the	lie	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	little	bangladeshi	girl	from	the	east	end	of	london	who	's	got	a	huge	 malign 	 ant 	 	tumor	on	the	right	side	of	her	face	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	made	her	blind	and	which	is	 rapid 	 ly 	 	growing	and	is	going	to	kill	her	 short 	 ly 	 	.
after	she	had	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	to	 re 	 move 	 	the	tumor	,	her	 parent 	 s 	 	 dress 	 ed 	 	her	in	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	green	 vel 	 vet 	 	dress	,	a	pink	ribbon	in	her	hair	,	and	they	 want 	 ed 	 	the	 paint 	 ing 	 	to	be	 show 	 n 	 	around	the	world	,	 de 	 spite 	 	the	fact	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	orthodox	muslims	and	the	mother	 wo 	 re 	 	a	full	burqa	.
so	it	's	not	 simpl 	 y 	 	a	western	 phenomen 	 on 	 	.
we	make	 judgment 	 s 	 	on	people	's	 face 	 s 	 	all	the	time	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	going	on	since	we	can	think	of	lombroso	and	the	way	he	would	define	criminal	 face 	 s 	 	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	you	could	see	criminal	 face 	 s 	 	,	 judg 	 ing 	 	them	just	on	the	 photograph 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 show 	 ed 	 	.
good	-	looking	people	are	 al 	 ways 	 	 judg 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	more	friendly	.
we	look	at	o.j	.	--	he	's	a	good	-	looking	guy	.
we	'd	like	to	 s 	 pend 	 	time	with	him	.	he	 look 	 s 	 	friendly	.
now	we	know	that	he	's	a	 convict 	 ed 	 	wife	-	batterer	,	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	he	's	not	the	good	guy	.
and	 beaut 	 y 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	equate	to	 good 	 ness 	 	,	and	 certain 	 ly 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	equate	to	 content 	 ment 	 	.
so	we	've	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	the	static	face	and	 judg 	 ing 	 	the	static	face	,	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	we	're	more	 comfort 	 able 	 	with	 judg 	 ing 	 	the	moving	face	.
we	think	we	can	 judg 	 e 	 	people	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 express 	 ions 	 	.
u.k.	 jur 	 ors 	 	in	the	u.k.	justice	system	like	to	see	a	live	witness	to	see	 whet 	 her 	 	they	can	pick	up	the	 tell 	 tale 	 	 sign 	 s 	 	of	 men 	 da 	 city 	 	--	the	blink	,	the	 hesit 	 ation 	 	.
and	so	they	want	to	see	live	 witness 	 es 	 	.
todorov	 tell 	 s 	 	us	that	,	in	a	tenth	of	a	second	,	we	can	make	a	judgment	on	 some 	 body 	 	's	face	.
are	we	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	image	?	 y 	 es 	 	,	we	are	.
would	we	be	happy	if	our	doctor	's	face	,	our	lawyer	's	face	,	our	financial	 advise 	 r 	 	's	face	was	 cover 	 ed 	 	?
we	'd	be	 pre 	 tty 	 	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	.
but	are	we	good	at	making	the	 judgment 	 s 	 	on	 fa 	 cial 	 	 appear 	 ance 	 	and	 move 	 ment 	 	?
the	truth	is	that	there	's	a	five	-	minute	rule	,	not	the	tenth	-	of	-	a	-	second	rule	like	todorov	,	but	a	five	-	minute	rule	.
if	you	 s 	 pend 	 	five	 minute 	 s 	 	with	 some 	 body 	 	,	you	start	looking	beyond	 the 	 ir 	 	 fa 	 cial 	 	 appear 	 ance 	 	,	and	the	people	who	you	're	 initi 	 ally 	 	 attract 	 ed 	 	to	may	seem	 bor 	 ing 	 	and	you	lose	interest	in	them	,	and	the	people	who	you	did	n't	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	seek	out	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	did	n't	find	them	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 attract 	 ive 	 	,	 be 	 come 	 	 attract 	 ive 	 	people	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 personal 	 ity 	 	.
so	we	've	 talk 	 ed 	 	a	lot	about	 fa 	 cial 	 	 appear 	 ance 	 	.
i	now	want	to	share	a	little	bit	of	the	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	that	we	do	--	where	we	're	at	and	where	we	're	going	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	image	of	ann	who	's	had	her	right	jaw	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	and	the	base	of	her	skull	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	.
and	you	can	see	in	the	 image 	 s 	 	 after 	 ward 	 	,	we	've	 manage 	 d 	 	to	 re 	 construct 	 	her	 success 	 fully 	 	.
but	that	's	not	good	 en 	 ough 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	ann	 want 	 s 	 	.	she	 want 	 s 	 	to	be	out	 kaya 	 king 	 	,	she	 want 	 s 	 	to	be	out	 climb 	 ing 	 	 mountain 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	what	she	 achiev 	 ed 	 	,	and	that	's	what	we	have	to	get	to	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 horr 	 ific 	 	image	,	so	i	'm	 put 	 ting 	 	my	hand	up	now	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	photograph	of	adi	,	a	nigerian	bank	 manage 	 r 	 	who	had	his	face	shot	off	in	an	 arm 	 ed 	 	 robber 	 y 	 	.
and	he	lost	his	lower	jaw	,	his	lip	,	his	chin	and	his	upper	jaw	and	 tee 	 th 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	bar	that	he	set	for	us	.
``	i	want	to	look	like	 th 	 is 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	i	 look 	 ed 	 	before	.	``
so	with	modern	technology	,	we	used	 computer 	 s 	 	to	make	 model 	 s 	 	.
we	made	a	model	of	the	jaw	 with 	 out 	 	bone	in	it	.
we	then	bent	a	plate	up	to	it	.
we	put	it	in	place	so	we	 k 	 new 	 	it	was	an	accurate	position	.
we	then	put	bone	and	tissue	from	the	back	.
here	you	can	see	the	plate	 hold 	 ing 	 	it	,	and	you	can	see	the	 implant 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	put	in	--	so	that	in	one	operation	we	 achiev 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	and	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	the	patient	's	life	is	 resto 	 red 	 	.
that	's	the	good	news	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	his	chin	skin	 do 	 es 	 	n't	look	the	same	 a 	 s 	 	it	did	before	.
it	's	skin	from	his	back	.
it	's	 thick 	 er 	 	,	it	's	 dark 	 er 	 	,	it	's	 coarse 	 r 	 	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	the	 con 	 tour 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	where	we	're	 fail 	 ing 	 	,
and	that	's	where	we	need	the	face	transplant	.
the	face	transplant	 ha 	 s 	 	a	role	 prob 	 ably 	 	in	 burn 	 s 	 	 patient 	 s 	 	to	replace	the	skin	.
we	can	replace	the	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	skeletal	structure	,	but	we	're	still	not	good	at	 re 	 placing 	 	the	 fa 	 cial 	 	skin	.
so	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 valu 	 able 	 	to	have	that	tool	in	our	 armament 	 arium 	 	.
but	the	 patient 	 s 	 	are	going	to	have	to	take	 drug 	 s 	 	that	suppress	 the 	 ir 	 	 immun 	 e 	 	system	for	the	rest	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	?
they	have	an	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	risk	of	 infect 	 ion 	 	,	an	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	risk	of	 malign 	 ancy 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	life	-	saving	transplant	--	like	a	heart	,	or	liver	,	or	lung	transplant	--	it	is	a	quality	-	of	-	life	transplant	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	,	are	the	 patient 	 s 	 	going	to	say	,	if	they	get	a	 malign 	 ant 	 	cancer	10	or	15	 year 	 s 	 	on	,	``	i	wish	i	'd	had	 convention 	 al 	 	 re 	 construct 	 ive 	 	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	now	 dy 	 ing 	 	of	a	 malign 	 ant 	 	cancer	``	?	we	do	n't	know	yet	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	do	n't	know	what	they	feel	about	 re 	 cognition 	 	and	 ident 	 ity 	 	.
bernard	devauchelle	and	sylvie	testelin	,	who	did	the	first	operation	,	are	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	that	.
 donor 	 s 	 	are	going	to	be	short	on	the	ground	,	 be 	 cause 	 	how	 man 	 y 	 	people	want	to	have	 the 	 ir 	 	 love 	 d 	 	one	's	face	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	at	the	point	of	death	?
so	there	are	going	to	be	 problem 	 s 	 	with	face	 transplant 	 ation 	 	.
so	the	better	news	is	the	future	's	 al 	 most 	 	here	--	and	the	future	is	tissue	 engineer 	 ing 	 	.
just	imagine	,	i	can	make	a	 bio 	 logically 	 	-	degradable	template	.
i	can	put	it	in	place	where	it	's	 me 	 ant 	 	to	be	.
i	can	 sprinkl 	 e 	 	a	few	 cell 	 s 	 	,	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	from	the	patient	's	own	hip	,	a	little	bit	of	 genetic 	 ally 	 	engineered	protein	,	and	lo	and	 be 	 hold 	 	,	 leav 	 e 	 	it	for	four	 month 	 s 	 	and	the	face	is	grown	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	bit	like	a	julia	child	recipe	.
but	we	've	still	got	 problem 	 s 	 	.
we	've	got	mouth	cancer	to	solve	.
we	're	still	not	 cur 	 ing 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	 patient 	 s 	 	--	it	's	the	most	 dis 	 figur 	 ing 	 	cancer	.
we	're	still	not	 re 	 construct 	 ing 	 	them	well	 en 	 ough 	 	.
in	the	u.k.	we	have	an	 epi 	 demic 	 	of	 fa 	 cial 	 	 inju 	 ries 	 	among	young	people	.
we	still	ca	n't	get	rid	of	 scar 	 s 	 	.
we	need	to	do	research	.
and	the	best	news	of	all	is	that	 surgeon 	 s 	 	know	that	we	need	to	do	research	.
and	we	've	set	up	 char 	 ities 	 	that	will	help	us	fund	the	 clinic 	 al 	 	research	to	determine	the	best	 treat 	 ment 	 	practice	now	and	better	 treat 	 ment 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	future	,	so	we	do	n't	just	 s 	 it 	 	on	our	laurels	and	say	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
let	's	 leav 	 e 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	.	``
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	.
