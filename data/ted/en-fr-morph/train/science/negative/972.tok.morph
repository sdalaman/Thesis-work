i	want	to	talk	to	you	 to 	 day 	 	about	 prosper 	 ity 	 	,	about	our	 hope 	 s 	 	for	a	 share 	 d 	 	and	 last 	 ing 	 	 prosper 	 ity 	 	.
and	not	just	us	,	but	the	two	billion	people	 world 	 wide 	 	who	are	still	 chronic 	 ally 	 	 under 	 nourish 	 ed 	 	.
and	hope	 actual 	 ly 	 	is	at	the	heart	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
in	fact	,	the	latin	word	for	hope	is	at	the	heart	of	the	word	 prosper 	 ity 	 	.
``	pro	-	speras	,	``	``	speras	,	``	hope	--	in	 accord 	 ance 	 	with	our	 hope 	 s 	 	and	 expect 	 ations 	 	.
the	 iron 	 y 	 	is	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	that	we	have	 cash 	 ed 	 	-	out	 prosper 	 ity 	 	 al 	 most 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	money	and	economic	growth	.
and	we	've	grown	our	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	so	much	that	we	now	stand	in	a	real	danger	of	 under 	 min 	 ing 	 	hope	--	running	down	 resource 	 s 	 	,	cutting	down	 rain 	 forest 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 pill 	 ing 	 	oil	 in 	 to 	 	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	of	mexico	,	changing	the	climate	--	and	the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 remote 	 ly 	 	 s 	 low 	 ed 	 	down	the	 relent 	 less 	 	rise	of	carbon	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	over	the	last	two	to	three	 decade 	 s 	 	is	 recess 	 ion 	 	.
and	 recess 	 ion 	 	,	of	course	,	is	n't	 exact 	 ly 	 	a	recipe	for	hope	either	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	're	 bus 	 y 	 	 find 	 ing 	 	out	.
so	we	're	caught	in	a	kind	of	trap	.
it	's	a	dilemma	,	a	dilemma	of	growth	.
we	ca	n't	live	with	it	;	we	ca	n't	live	 with 	 out 	 	it	.
trash	the	system	or	crash	the	planet	--
it	's	a	tough	choice	;	it	is	n't	much	of	a	choice	.
and	our	best	 a 	 venue 	 	of	 es 	 cape 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	is	a	kind	of	blind	faith	in	our	own	 clever 	 ness 	 	and	technology	and	efficiency	and	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	more	 efficient 	 ly 	 	.
now	i	have	n't	got	 any 	 thing 	 	against	efficiency	.	and	i	think	we	are	a	clever	species	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	.
but	i	think	we	should	 al 	 so 	 	just	check	the	 number 	 s 	 	,	take	a	 re 	 ality 	 	check	here	.	so	i	want	you	to	imagine	a	world	,	in	2050	,	of	around	nine	billion	people	,	all	 aspir 	 ing 	 	to	western	 income 	 s 	 	,	western	 life 	 style 	 s 	 	.
and	i	want	to	ask	the	question	--	and	we	'll	give	them	that	two	percent	 hik 	 e 	 	in	income	,	in	 s 	 al 	 ary 	 	each	year	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 believ 	 e 	 	in	growth	.
and	i	want	to	ask	the	question	:	how	far	and	how	fast	would	be	have	to	move	?
how	clever	would	we	have	to	be	?
how	much	technology	would	we	need	in	 th 	 is 	 	world	to	deliver	our	carbon	 target 	 s 	 	?
and	here	in	my	chart	--	on	the	left	-	hand	side	is	where	we	are	now	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	carbon	 intens 	 ity 	 	of	economic	growth	in	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	at	the	moment	.
it	's	around	about	770	 gram 	 s 	 	of	carbon	.
in	the	world	i	 de 	 scribe 	 	to	you	,	we	have	to	be	right	over	here	at	the	right	-	hand	side	at	six	 gram 	 s 	 	of	carbon	.
it	's	a	130	-	fold	 improve 	 ment 	 	,	and	that	is	10	 time 	 s 	 	further	and	 fast 	 er 	 	than	 any 	 thing 	 	we	've	ever	 achiev 	 ed 	 	in	industrial	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	we	can	do	it	,	 may 	 be 	 	it	's	possible	--	who	 know 	 s 	 	?
 may 	 be 	 	we	can	even	go	further	and	get	an	 eco 	 nomy 	 	that	 pull 	 s 	 	carbon	out	of	the	atmosphere	,	which	is	what	we	're	going	to	need	to	be	 do 	 ing 	 	by	the	end	of	the	century	.
but	should	n't	we	just	check	first	that	the	economic	system	that	we	have	is	 remote 	 ly 	 	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 deliver 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 improve 	 ment 	 	?
so	i	want	to	just	 s 	 pend 	 	a	couple	of	 minute 	 s 	 	on	system	 dynamic 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	bit	complex	,	and	i	 apolog 	 ize 	 	for	that	.
what	i	'll	try	and	do	,	is	i	'll	try	and	 para 	 phrase 	 	it	is	sort	of	human	 term 	 s 	 	.
so	it	 look 	 s 	 	a	little	bit	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 firm 	 s 	 	produce	 good 	 s 	 	for	 house 	 hold 	 s 	 	--	that	's	us	--	and	provide	us	with	 income 	 s 	 	,	and	that	's	even	better	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	can	 s 	 pend 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 income 	 s 	 	on	more	 good 	 s 	 	and	 service 	 s 	 	.
that	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 circul 	 ar 	 	flow	of	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
it	 look 	 s 	 	 harm 	 less 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	.
i	just	want	to	 high 	 light 	 	one	key	feature	of	 th 	 is 	 	system	,	which	is	the	role	of	 invest 	 ment 	 	.
now	 invest 	 ment 	 	 constitute 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	about	a	fifth	of	the	national	income	in	most	modern	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	,	but	it	 play 	 s 	 	an	 absolute 	 ly 	 	vital	role	.
and	what	it	 do 	 es 	 	 essential 	 ly 	 	is	to	 stimul 	 ate 	 	further	consumption	growth	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	a	couple	of	ways	--	chasing	 product 	 ivity 	 	,	which	 drive 	 s 	 	down	 price 	 s 	 	and	 encourag 	 es 	 	us	to	buy	more	stuff	.
but	i	want	to	 concent 	 rate 	 	on	the	role	of	 invest 	 ment 	 	in	seeking	out	 novel 	 ty 	 	,	the	production	and	consumption	of	 novel 	 ty 	 	.
joseph	schumpeter	 call 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	``	the	process	of	creative	 destruct 	 ion 	 	.	``
it	's	a	process	of	the	production	and	 re 	 production 	 	of	 novel 	 ty 	 	,	 continu 	 ally 	 	chasing	 expand 	 ing 	 	consumer	 market 	 s 	 	,	consumer	 good 	 s 	 	,	new	consumer	 good 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	it	 get 	 s 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	have	 some 	 thing 	 	of	an	 appetit 	 e 	 	for	 novel 	 ty 	 	.
we	love	new	stuff	--	new	material	stuff	for	 s 	 ure 	 	--	but	 al 	 so 	 	new	 idea 	 s 	 	,	new	 adventure 	 s 	 	,	new	 experience 	 s 	 	.
but	the	 material 	 ity 	 	 matter 	 s 	 	too	,
 be 	 cause 	 	in	every	 socie 	 ty 	 	that	 anthropo 	 logists 	 	have	 look 	 ed 	 	at	,	material	stuff	 oper 	 ates 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	language	--	a	language	of	 good 	 s 	 	,	a	 symbol 	 ic 	 	language	that	we	use	to	tell	each	other	 st 	 ories 	 	--	 st 	 ories 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	about	how	 import 	 ant 	 	we	are	.
 stat 	 us 	 	-	driven	,	conspicuous	consumption	 thriv 	 es 	 	from	the	language	of	 novel 	 ty 	 	.
and	here	,	all	of	a	sudden	,	we	have	a	system	that	is	 lock 	 ing 	 	economic	structure	with	social	logic	--	the	economic	 institution 	 s 	 	,	and	who	we	are	 a 	 s 	 	people	,	 lock 	 ed 	 	together	to	drive	an	engine	of	growth	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	engine	is	not	just	economic	value	;	it	is	 pull 	 ing 	 	material	 resource 	 s 	 	 relent 	 lessly 	 	through	the	system	,	driven	by	our	own	 in 	 sati 	 able 	 	 appetit 	 es 	 	,	driven	in	fact	by	a	sense	of	 anxie 	 ty 	 	.
adam	smith	,	200	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	spoke	about	our	 desir 	 e 	 	for	a	life	 with 	 out 	 	shame	.
a	life	 with 	 out 	 	shame	:	in	his	day	,	what	that	 me 	 ant 	 	was	a	 line 	 n 	 	shirt	,	and	 to 	 day 	 	,	well	,	you	still	need	the	shirt	,	but	you	need	the	hybrid	car	,	the	hdtv	,	two	 holi 	 day 	 s 	 	a	year	in	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	the	 net 	 book 	 	and	ipad	,	the	list	 go 	 es 	 	on	--	an	 al 	 most 	 	 in 	 exhaust 	 ible 	 	supply	of	 good 	 s 	 	,	driven	by	 th 	 is 	 	 anxie 	 ty 	 	.
and	even	if	we	do	n't	want	them	,	we	need	to	buy	them	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	if	we	do	n't	buy	them	,	the	system	 crash 	 es 	 	.
and	to	stop	it	 crash 	 ing 	 	over	the	last	two	to	three	 decade 	 s 	 	,	we	've	 expand 	 ed 	 	the	money	supply	,	 expand 	 ed 	 	credit	and	debt	,	so	that	people	can	keep	 buy 	 ing 	 	stuff	.
and	of	course	,	that	expansion	was	 deep 	 ly 	 	 implic 	 ated 	 	in	the	crisis	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	--	i	just	want	to	show	you	some	data	here	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	,	 essential 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	credit	and	debt	system	,	just	for	the	u.k	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	the	last	15	 year 	 s 	 	before	the	crash	,
and	you	can	see	there	,	consumer	debt	rose	 dramat 	 ically 	 	.
it	was	above	the	gdp	for	three	 year 	 s 	 	in	a	row	just	before	the	crisis	.
and	in	the	mean	time	,	personal	 saving 	 s 	 	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 plummet 	 ed 	 	.
the	 saving 	 s 	 	ratio	,	net	 saving 	 s 	 	,	 we 	 re 	 	 be 	 low 	 	zero	in	the	middle	of	2008	,	just	before	the	crash	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	people	 expand 	 ing 	 	debt	,	 draw 	 ing 	 	down	 the 	 ir 	 	 saving 	 s 	 	,	just	to	stay	in	the	game	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	strange	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	 per 	 verse 	 	,	story	,	just	to	put	it	in	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 term 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	story	about	us	,	people	,	 be 	 ing 	 	 persuad 	 ed 	 	to	 s 	 pend 	 	money	we	do	n't	have	on	 thing 	 s 	 	we	do	n't	need	to	create	 impression 	 s 	 	that	wo	n't	last	on	people	we	do	n't	care	about	.
but	before	we	 con 	 sign 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	despair	,	 may 	 be 	 	we	should	just	go	back	and	say	,	``	did	we	get	 th 	 is 	 	right	?
is	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	how	people	are	?
is	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	how	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	 behav 	 e 	 	?	``
and	 al 	 most 	 	 straight 	 away 	 	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	run	up	against	a	couple	of	 anomal 	 ies 	 	.
the	first	one	is	in	the	crisis	 it 	 self 	 	.
in	the	crisis	,	in	the	 recess 	 ion 	 	,	what	do	people	want	to	do	?
they	want	to	 hunk 	 er 	 	down	,	they	want	to	look	to	the	future	.
they	want	to	 s 	 pend 	 	less	and	 s 	 ave 	 	more	.
but	saving	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	wrong	thing	to	do	from	the	system	point	of	view	.
keynes	 call 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	the	``	paradox	of	 th 	 rift 	 	``	--	saving	 s 	 low 	 s 	 	down	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	.
and	 politic 	 ians 	 	call	on	us	 continu 	 ally 	 	to	draw	down	more	debt	,	to	draw	down	our	own	 saving 	 s 	 	even	further	,	just	so	that	we	can	get	the	show	back	on	the	road	,	so	we	can	keep	 th 	 is 	 	growth	-	based	 eco 	 nomy 	 	going	.
it	's	an	 anomal 	 y 	 	,	it	's	a	place	where	the	system	 actual 	 ly 	 	is	at	 odd 	 s 	 	with	who	we	are	 a 	 s 	 	people	.
here	's	 an 	 other 	 	one	--	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	one	:	why	is	it	that	we	do	n't	do	the	 blind 	 ing 	 ly 	 	obvious	 thing 	 s 	 	we	should	do	to	combat	climate	change	,	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 buy 	 ing 	 	energy	-	efficient	 appli 	 ance 	 s 	 	,	 put 	 ting 	 	in	efficient	 light 	 s 	 	,	 turn 	 ing 	 	the	 light 	 s 	 	off	 occasion 	 ally 	 	,	 insula 	 ting 	 	our	 home 	 s 	 	?
these	 thing 	 s 	 	 s 	 ave 	 	carbon	,	they	 s 	 ave 	 	energy	,	they	 s 	 ave 	 	us	money	.
so	is	it	that	,	 th 	 ough 	 	they	make	perfect	economic	sense	,	we	do	n't	do	them	?
well	,	i	had	my	own	personal	 in 	 sight 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
it	was	a	sunday	 even 	 ing 	 	,	sunday	afternoon	,
and	it	was	just	after	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	to	be	honest	,	too	long	after	--	we	had	 move 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	new	house	.
and	i	had	 final 	 ly 	 	got	around	to	 do 	 ing 	 	some	draft	 strip 	 ping 	 	,	 install 	 ing 	 	 insula 	 tion 	 	around	the	 window 	 s 	 	and	 door 	 s 	 	to	keep	out	the	 draft 	 s 	 	.
and	my	,	then	,	five	year	-	old	daughter	was	 help 	 ing 	 	me	in	the	way	that	five	year	-	olds	do	.
and	we	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	for	a	while	,	when	she	 turn 	 ed 	 	to	me	 ver 	 y 	 	 solemn 	 ly 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	will	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	keep	out	the	 giraffe 	 s 	 	?	``
``	here	they	are	,	the	 giraffe 	 s 	 	.	``
you	can	hear	the	five	-	year	-	old	mind	 work 	 ing 	 	.
these	 one 	 s 	 	,	 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	are	400	 mile 	 s 	 	north	of	here	 out 	 side 	 	barrow	-	in	-	furness	in	cumbria	.
 good 	 ness 	 	 know 	 s 	 	what	they	make	of	the	lake	 di 	 strict 	 	weather	.
but	 actual 	 ly 	 	that	 child 	 ish 	 	 mis 	 represent 	 ation 	 	 s 	 tuck 	 	with	me	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 be 	 came 	 	clear	to	me	why	we	do	n't	do	the	 blind 	 ing 	 ly 	 	obvious	 thing 	 s 	 	.
we	're	too	 bus 	 y 	 	 keep 	 ing 	 	out	the	 giraffe 	 s 	 	--	 put 	 ting 	 	the	 kid 	 s 	 	on	the	bus	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	 get 	 ting 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	work	on	time	,	 surviv 	 ing 	 	email	 over 	 load 	 	and	shop	floor	 politic 	 s 	 	,	 for 	 aging 	 	for	 grocer 	 ies 	 	,	 throw 	 ing 	 	together	 meal 	 s 	 	,	 es 	 cap 	 ing 	 	for	a	couple	of	precious	 hour 	 s 	 	in	the	 even 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	prime	-	time	tv	or	ted	 on 	 line 	 	,	 get 	 ting 	 	from	one	end	of	the	day	to	the	other	,	 keep 	 ing 	 	out	the	 giraffe 	 s 	 	.
what	is	the	 object 	 ive 	 	?
``	what	is	the	 object 	 ive 	 	of	the	consumer	?	``
mary	douglas	 ask 	 ed 	 	in	an	essay	on	poverty	written	35	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
``	it	is	,	``	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	to	help	create	the	social	world	and	find	a	credible	place	in	it	.	``
that	is	a	 deep 	 ly 	 	 human 	 izing 	 	vision	of	our	 live 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	vision	than	the	one	that	lies	at	the	heart	of	 th 	 is 	 	economic	model	.
so	who	are	we	?
who	are	these	people	?
are	we	these	 novel 	 ty 	 	-	seeking	,	 hedon 	 istic 	 	,	 self 	 ish 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	?
or	might	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 occasion 	 ally 	 	be	 some 	 thing 	 	like	the	 self 	 less 	 	altruist	 depict 	 ed 	 	in	rembrandt	's	 love 	 ly 	 	,	 love 	 ly 	 	sketch	here	?
well	 psycho 	 logy 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 say 	 s 	 	there	is	a	tension	--	a	tension	between	self	-	 regard 	 ing 	 	 behavior 	 s 	 	and	other	 regard 	 ing 	 	 behavior 	 s 	 	.
and	these	 tension 	 s 	 	have	deep	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 root 	 s 	 	,
so	 self 	 ish 	 	behavior	is	 adapt 	 ive 	 	in	certain	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	--	fight	or	flight	.
but	other	 regard 	 ing 	 	 behavior 	 s 	 	are	essential	to	our	evolution	 a 	 s 	 	social	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	even	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	from	our	point	of	view	,	 an 	 other 	 	tension	between	 novel 	 ty 	 	-	seeking	 behavior 	 s 	 	and	tradition	or	 conserv 	 ation 	 	.
 novel 	 ty 	 	is	 adapt 	 ive 	 	when	 thing 	 s 	 	are	changing	and	you	need	to	adapt	 your 	 self 	 	.
tradition	is	essential	to	lay	down	the	 st 	 ability 	 	to	raise	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	and	form	 cohes 	 ive 	 	social	 group 	 s 	 	.
so	here	,	all	of	a	sudden	,	we	're	looking	at	a	map	of	the	human	heart	.
and	it	 reveal 	 s 	 	to	us	,	 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	the	crux	of	the	matter	.
what	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	is	we	've	 create 	 d 	 	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	.
we	've	 create 	 d 	 	 system 	 s 	 	,	which	 system 	 at 	 ically 	 	privilege	,	 encourag 	 e 	 	,	one	narrow	 quad 	 rant 	 	of	the	human	soul	and	left	the	 other 	 s 	 	 un 	 regard 	 ed 	 	.
and	in	the	same	 to 	 ken 	 	,	the	solution	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	clear	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	,	 there 	 fore 	 	,	about	changing	human	nature	.
it	is	n't	,	in	fact	,	about	 cur 	 tail 	 ing 	 	 possibil 	 ities 	 	.
it	is	about	 open 	 ing 	 	up	.
it	is	about	 allow 	 ing 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	the	 free 	 dom 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	fully	human	,	 recogn 	 izing 	 	the	depth	and	the	 bread 	 th 	 	of	the	human	 psych 	 e 	 	and	building	 institution 	 s 	 	to	protect	rembrandt	's	fragile	altruist	 with 	 in 	 	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	mean	for	 economic 	 s 	 	?
what	would	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	look	like	if	we	took	that	vision	of	human	nature	at	 the 	 ir 	 	heart	and	 stretch 	 ed 	 	them	 a 	 long 	 	these	 ortho 	 gon 	 al 	 	 dimension 	 s 	 	of	the	human	 psych 	 e 	 	?
well	,	it	might	look	a	little	bit	like	the	4,000	community	-	interest	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	that	have	 sp 	 rung 	 	up	in	the	u.k.	over	the	last	five	 year 	 s 	 	and	a	similar	rise	in	b	 corporation 	 s 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	 enterprise 	 s 	 	that	have	 eco 	 logical 	 	and	social	 goal 	 s 	 	written	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 constit 	 ution 	 	at	 the 	 ir 	 	heart	--	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	,	in	fact	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	ecosia	.
and	i	just	want	to	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	show	you	 th 	 is 	 	.
ecosia	is	an	 inter 	 net 	 	search	engine	.
 inter 	 net 	 	search	 engine 	 s 	 	work	by	 draw 	 ing 	 	 revenue 	 s 	 	from	 sponsor 	 ed 	 	 link 	 s 	 	that	appear	when	you	do	a	search	.
and	ecosia	 work 	 s 	 	in	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	the	same	way	.
so	we	can	do	that	here	--
we	can	just	put	in	a	little	search	term	.
there	you	go	,	oxford	,	that	's	where	we	are	.	see	what	 come 	 s 	 	up	.
the	 differ 	 ence 	 	with	ecosia	 th 	 ough 	 	is	that	,	in	ecosia	's	case	,	it	 draw 	 s 	 	the	 revenue 	 s 	 	in	the	same	way	,	but	it	 al 	 locate 	 s 	 	80	percent	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 revenue 	 s 	 	to	a	 rain 	 forest 	 	 protect 	 ion 	 	project	in	the	amazon	.
and	we	're	going	to	do	it	.
we	're	just	going	to	click	on	naturejobs	.	uk	.
in	case	 any 	 one 	 	out	there	is	looking	for	a	job	in	a	 recess 	 ion 	 	,	that	's	the	page	to	go	to	.
and	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	then	was	the	sponsor	 g 	 ave 	 	 revenue 	 s 	 	to	ecosia	,	and	ecosia	is	giving	80	percent	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 revenue 	 s 	 	to	a	 rain 	 forest 	 	 protect 	 ion 	 	project	.
it	's	taking	 profit 	 s 	 	from	one	place	and	 al 	 loc 	 ating 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	the	 protect 	 ion 	 	of	 eco 	 logical 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	different	kind	of	enterprise	for	a	new	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
it	's	a	form	,	if	you	like	,	of	 eco 	 logical 	 	 al 	 truism 	 	--	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 a 	 long 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	lines	.	 may 	 be 	 	it	's	that	.
 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	,	 what 	 ever 	 	 th 	 is 	 	new	 eco 	 nomy 	 	is	,	what	we	need	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	to	do	,	in	fact	,	is	to	put	 invest 	 ment 	 	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	heart	of	the	model	,	to	re	-	 conceiv 	 e 	 	 invest 	 ment 	 	.
 on 	 ly 	 	now	,	 invest 	 ment 	 	is	n't	going	to	be	about	the	 relent 	 less 	 	and	 mind 	 less 	 	 pur 	 suit 	 	of	consumption	growth	.
 invest 	 ment 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	a	different	beast	.
 invest 	 ment 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	,	in	the	new	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	 protect 	 ing 	 	and	 nurtur 	 ing 	 	the	 eco 	 logical 	 	 asset 	 s 	 	on	which	our	future	 depend 	 s 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	about	 transit 	 ion 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 invest 	 ing 	 	in	low	-	carbon	 techno 	 logies 	 	and	 infra 	 structure 	 s 	 	.
we	have	to	invest	,	in	fact	,	in	the	idea	of	a	 meaning 	 ful 	 	 prosper 	 ity 	 	,	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	 cap 	 abilities 	 	for	people	to	flourish	.
and	of	course	,	 th 	 is 	 	task	 ha 	 s 	 	material	 dimension 	 s 	 	.
it	would	be	 non 	 sense 	 	to	talk	about	people	 flourish 	 ing 	 	if	they	did	n't	have	food	,	 cloth 	 ing 	 	and	shelter	.
but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	clear	that	 prosper 	 ity 	 	 go 	 es 	 	beyond	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	social	and	 psycho 	 logical 	 	 aim 	 s 	 	--	family	,	 friend 	 ship 	 	,	 commit 	 ments 	 	,	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	 particip 	 ating 	 	in	the	life	of	that	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	too	 requir 	 es 	 	 invest 	 ment 	 	,	 invest 	 ment 	 	--	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	in	 place 	 s 	 	--	 place 	 s 	 	where	we	can	connect	,	 place 	 s 	 	where	we	can	 particip 	 ate 	 	,	 share 	 d 	 	 space 	 s 	 	,	concert	 hall 	 s 	 	,	 garden 	 s 	 	,	public	 park 	 s 	 	,	 lib 	 r 	 aries 	 	,	 museum 	 s 	 	,	quiet	 center 	 s 	 	,	 place 	 s 	 	of	joy	and	 celebr 	 ation 	 	,	 place 	 s 	 	of	 tranquil 	 ity 	 	and	 contempl 	 ation 	 	,	 s 	 ites 	 	for	the	``	 cultiv 	 ation 	 	of	a	common	 citizen 	 ship 	 	,	``	in	michael	sandel	's	 love 	 ly 	 	phrase	.
an	 invest 	 ment 	 	--	 invest 	 ment 	 	,	after	all	,	is	just	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 bas 	 ic 	 	economic	 con 	 cept 	 	--	is	 noth 	 ing 	 	more	nor	less	than	a	relationship	between	the	present	and	the	future	,	a	 share 	 d 	 	present	and	a	common	future	.
and	we	need	that	relationship	to	reflect	,	to	 re 	 claim 	 	hope	.
so	let	me	come	back	,	with	 th 	 is 	 	sense	of	hope	,	to	the	two	billion	people	still	 try 	 ing 	 	to	live	each	day	on	less	than	the	price	of	a	 skin 	 ny 	 	latte	from	the	cafe	next	door	.
what	can	we	 off 	 er 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	people	?
it	's	clear	that	we	have	a	 respons 	 ibility 	 	to	help	lift	them	out	of	poverty	.
it	's	clear	that	we	have	a	 respons 	 ibility 	 	to	make	room	for	growth	where	growth	 re 	 ally 	 	 matter 	 s 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 poor 	 est 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	clear	that	we	will	never	 achiev 	 e 	 	that	 un 	 less 	 	we	're	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 re 	 defi 	 ning 	 	a	 meaning 	 ful 	 	sense	of	 prosper 	 ity 	 	in	the	 rich 	 er 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	,	a	 prosper 	 ity 	 	that	is	more	 meaning 	 ful 	 	and	less	 material 	 istic 	 	than	the	growth	-	based	model	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	just	a	western	post	-	 material 	 ist 	 	 fanta 	 s 	 y 	 	.
in	fact	,	an	african	 philosoph 	 er 	 	wrote	to	me	,	when	``	 prosper 	 ity 	 	 with 	 out 	 	growth	``	was	 publish 	 ed 	 	,	 point 	 ing 	 	out	the	 similar 	 ities 	 	between	 th 	 is 	 	view	of	 prosper 	 ity 	 	and	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	african	 con 	 cept 	 	of	ubuntu	.
ubuntu	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	am	 be 	 cause 	 	we	are	.	``
 prosper 	 ity 	 	is	a	 share 	 d 	 	endeavor	.
 it 	 s 	 	 root 	 s 	 	are	long	and	deep	--
 it 	 s 	 	 found 	 ations 	 	,	i	've	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	show	,	exist	 al 	 ready 	 	,	 in 	 side 	 	each	of	us	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	about	 stand 	 ing 	 	in	the	way	of	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
it	's	not	about	 over 	 throw 	 ing 	 	 capital 	 ism 	 	.
it	's	not	about	 try 	 ing 	 	to	change	human	nature	.
what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	here	is	we	're	taking	a	few	simple	 step 	 s 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	an	 economic 	 s 	 	fit	for	purpose	.
and	at	the	heart	of	that	 economic 	 s 	 	,	we	're	placing	a	more	credible	,	more	 ro 	 bust 	 	,	and	more	realistic	vision	of	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	to	be	human	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
chris	anderson	:	while	they	're	taking	the	 pod 	 ium 	 	away	,	just	a	quick	question	.
first	of	all	,	 economist 	 s 	 	are	n't	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	inspiring	,	so	you	may	need	to	work	on	the	tone	a	little	.
can	you	picture	the	 politic 	 ians 	 	ever	 buy 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	?
i	mean	,	can	you	picture	a	 politic 	 ian 	 	 stand 	 ing 	 	up	in	britain	and	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	gdp	fell	two	percent	 th 	 is 	 	year	.	good	news	!
we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	all	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	,	and	a	country	's	more	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	and	our	 live 	 s 	 	are	better	.	``
tim	jackson	:	well	that	's	 clear 	 ly 	 	not	what	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	.
you	're	not	making	news	out	of	 thing 	 s 	 	 fall 	 ing 	 	down	.
you	're	making	news	out	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	tell	you	that	we	're	 flourish 	 ing 	 	.
can	i	picture	 politic 	 ians 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	it	?
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	 al 	 ready 	 	am	 see 	 ing 	 	a	little	bit	of	it	.
when	we	first	 start 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	work	,	 politic 	 ians 	 	would	stand	up	,	 treasu 	 ry 	 	 spoke 	 s 	 men 	 	would	stand	up	,	and	 accus 	 e 	 	us	of	 want 	 ing 	 	to	go	back	and	live	in	 cave 	 s 	 	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	in	the	period	through	which	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	over	the	last	18	 year 	 s 	 	--	 part 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	financial	crisis	and	a	little	bit	of	 humil 	 ity 	 	in	the	profession	of	 economic 	 s 	 	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	people	are	 engag 	 ing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	issue	in	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 count 	 ries 	 	around	the	world	.
ca	:	but	is	it	 main 	 ly 	 	 politic 	 ians 	 	who	are	going	to	have	to	get	 the 	 ir 	 	act	together	,	or	is	it	going	to	be	more	just	civil	 socie 	 ty 	 	and	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	?
tj	:	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	civil	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
but	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	have	 politic 	 al 	 	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	kind	of	agenda	,	which	 actual 	 ly 	 	 politic 	 ians 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	are	kind	of	caught	in	that	dilemma	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 hook 	 ed 	 	on	the	growth	model	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
but	 actual 	 ly 	 	 open 	 ing 	 	up	the	space	to	think	about	different	ways	of	 govern 	 ing 	 	,	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 politic 	 s 	 	,	and	creating	the	space	for	civil	 socie 	 ty 	 	and	 business 	 es 	 	to	 oper 	 ate 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	--	 absolute 	 ly 	 	vital	.
ca	:	and	if	 some 	 one 	 	could	 con 	 vince 	 	you	that	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	can	make	the	--	what	was	it	?	--	the	130	-	fold	 improve 	 ment 	 	in	efficiency	,	of	 r 	 eduction 	 	of	carbon	 foot 	 print 	 	,	would	you	then	 actual 	 ly 	 	like	that	picture	of	economic	growth	 in 	 to 	 	more	knowledge	-	based	 good 	 s 	 	?
tj	:	i	would	still	want	to	know	that	you	could	do	that	and	get	 be 	 low 	 	zero	by	the	end	of	the	century	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	taking	carbon	out	of	the	atmosphere	,	and	solve	the	problem	of	 bio 	 divers 	 ity 	 	and	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	impact	on	land	use	and	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	the	 ero 	 s 	 ion 	 	of	 top 	 s 	 oil 	 s 	 	and	the	quality	of	water	.
if	you	can	 con 	 vince 	 	me	we	can	do	all	that	,	then	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	i	would	take	the	two	percent	.
