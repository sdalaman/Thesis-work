i	want	to	talk	 to 	 day 	 	about	--	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	take	the	long	view	,	and	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	what	i	think	are	the	three	 big 	 gest 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	for	 human 	 ity 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	long	point	of	view	.
some	of	these	have	 al 	 ready 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 touch 	 ed 	 	 up 	 on 	 	by	other	 speaker 	 s 	 	,	which	is	 encourag 	 ing 	 	.
it	 seem 	 s 	 	that	there	's	not	just	one	person	who	 think 	 s 	 	that	these	 problem 	 s 	 	are	 import 	 ant 	 	.
the	first	is	--	death	is	a	big	problem	.
if	you	look	at	the	 statistic 	 s 	 	,	the	 odd 	 s 	 	are	not	 ver 	 y 	 	 favor 	 able 	 	to	us	.
so	far	,	most	people	who	have	lived	have	 al 	 so 	 	 di 	 ed 	 	.
 rough 	 ly 	 	90	percent	of	 every 	 body 	 	who	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 al 	 ive 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 di 	 ed 	 	by	now	.
so	the	annual	death	rate	 add 	 s 	 	up	to	150,000	--	sorry	,	the	 dai 	 ly 	 	death	rate	--	150,000	people	per	day	,	which	is	a	huge	number	by	any	standard	.
the	annual	death	rate	,	then	,	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	56	million	.
if	we	just	look	at	the	single	,	 big 	 gest 	 	cause	of	death	--	aging	--	it	 account 	 s 	 	for	 rough 	 ly 	 	two	-	 third 	 s 	 	of	all	human	people	who	die	.
that	 add 	 s 	 	up	to	an	annual	death	toll	of	 great 	 er 	 	than	the	population	of	canada	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	we	do	n't	see	a	problem	 be 	 cause 	 	either	it	's	too	familiar	or	it	's	too	big	.
ca	n't	see	it	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	too	big	.
i	think	death	might	be	both	too	familiar	and	too	big	for	most	people	to	see	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	problem	.
once	you	think	about	it	,	you	see	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 statistic 	 al 	 	 point 	 s 	 	;
these	are	--	let	's	see	,	how	far	have	i	 talk 	 ed 	 	?
i	've	 talk 	 ed 	 	for	three	 minute 	 s 	 	.
so	that	would	be	,	 rough 	 ly 	 	,	324	people	have	 di 	 ed 	 	since	i	've	 beg 	 un 	 	 s 	 peaking 	 	.
people	like	--	it	's	 rough 	 ly 	 	the	population	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	 ha 	 s 	 	just	 di 	 ed 	 	.
now	,	the	human	cost	of	that	is	obvious	,
once	you	start	to	think	about	it	--	the	 suffer 	 ing 	 	,	the	loss	--	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	,	 economic 	 ally 	 	,	 enormous 	 ly 	 	 waste 	 ful 	 	.
i	just	look	at	the	information	,	and	knowledge	,	and	experience	that	is	lost	due	to	natural	 cause 	 s 	 	of	death	in	general	,	and	aging	,	in	 part 	 icular 	 	.
suppose	we	 approximate 	 d 	 	one	person	with	one	book	?	now	,	of	course	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 under 	 estimation 	 	.
a	person	's	 life 	 time 	 	of	 learn 	 ing 	 	and	experience	is	a	lot	more	than	you	could	put	 in 	 to 	 	a	single	book	.
but	let	's	suppose	we	did	 th 	 is 	 	.
52	million	people	die	of	natural	 cause 	 s 	 	each	year	 correspond 	 s 	 	,	then	,	to	52	million	 volume 	 s 	 	 destroy 	 ed 	 	.
library	of	congress	 hold 	 s 	 	18	million	 volume 	 s 	 	.
we	are	 up 	 set 	 	about	the	 burn 	 ing 	 	of	the	library	of	alexandria	.
it	's	one	of	the	great	cultural	 tra 	 ged 	 ies 	 	that	we	remember	,	even	 to 	 day 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	three	 lib 	 r 	 aries 	 	of	congress	--	 burn 	 t 	 	down	,	 fore 	 ver 	 	lost	--	each	year	.
so	that	's	the	first	big	problem	.
and	i	wish	 god 	 speed 	 	to	aubrey	de	 gr 	 ey 	 	,	and	other	people	like	him	,	to	try	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	possible	.
existential	risk	--	the	second	big	problem	.
existential	risk	is	a	threat	to	human	 surviv 	 al 	 	,	or	to	the	long	-	term	potential	of	our	species	.
now	,	why	do	i	say	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	big	problem	?
well	,	let	's	first	look	at	the	 prob 	 ability 	 	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	to	estimate	--	but	there	have	 be 	 en 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	four	 stud 	 ies 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	in	 re 	 cent 	 	 year 	 s 	 	,	which	is	surprising	.
you	would	think	that	it	would	be	of	some	interest	to	try	to	find	out	more	about	 th 	 is 	 	 give 	 n 	 	that	the	 s 	 take 	 s 	 	are	so	big	,	but	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 neglect 	 ed 	 	area	.
but	there	have	 be 	 en 	 	four	 stud 	 ies 	 	--	one	by	john	lesley	,	wrote	a	book	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
he	 estimate 	 d 	 	a	 prob 	 ability 	 	that	we	will	fail	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	the	current	century	:	50	percent	.
 similar 	 ly 	 	,	the	astronomer	royal	,	whom	we	heard	speak	 yester 	 day 	 	,	 al 	 so 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	50	percent	 prob 	 ability 	 	estimate	.
 an 	 other 	 	author	 do 	 es 	 	n't	give	any	 numeric 	 al 	 	estimate	,	but	 say 	 s 	 	the	 prob 	 ability 	 	is	significant	that	it	will	fail	.
i	wrote	a	long	paper	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	 assign 	 ing 	 	a	less	than	20	percent	 prob 	 ability 	 	would	be	a	 mistak 	 e 	 	in	light	of	the	current	evidence	we	have	.
now	,	the	exact	 figure 	 s 	 	here	,	we	should	take	with	a	big	grain	of	salt	,	but	there	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	a	 con 	 sens 	 us 	 	that	the	risk	is	 sub 	 stantial 	 	.
 every 	 body 	 	who	 ha 	 s 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	and	 stud 	 ied 	 	it	 agree 	 s 	 	.
now	,	if	we	think	about	what	just	 reduc 	 ing 	 	the	 prob 	 ability 	 	of	human	 extinct 	 ion 	 	by	just	one	 percent 	 age 	 	point	--	not	 ver 	 y 	 	much	--	so	that	's	 equi 	 valent 	 	to	60	million	 live 	 s 	 	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	,	if	we	just	count	the	 current 	 ly 	 	living	people	,	the	current	generation	.
now	one	percent	of	six	billion	people	is	 equi 	 valent 	 	to	60	million	.
so	that	's	a	large	number	.
if	we	 we 	 re 	 	to	take	 in 	 to 	 	account	future	 generation 	 s 	 	that	will	never	come	 in 	 to 	 	 exist 	 ence 	 	if	we	blow	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	up	,	then	the	figure	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	astronomical	.
if	we	could	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 colon 	 ize 	 	a	chunk	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	--	the	virgo	 super 	 cluster 	 	--	 may 	 be 	 	it	will	take	us	100	million	 year 	 s 	 	to	get	there	,	but	if	we	go	extinct	we	never	will	.
then	,	even	a	one	 percent 	 age 	 	point	 r 	 eduction 	 	in	the	 extinct 	 ion 	 	risk	could	be	 equi 	 valent 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	astronomical	number	--	10	to	the	power	of	32	.
so	if	you	take	 in 	 to 	 	account	future	 generation 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	our	own	,	every	other	moral	 imper 	 ative 	 	of	 philanthro 	 pic 	 	cost	just	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 ir 	 relevant 	 	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	you	should	focus	on	would	be	to	 reduc 	 e 	 	existential	risk	 be 	 cause 	 	even	the	 tin 	 iest 	 	 de 	 crease 	 	in	existential	risk	would	just	overwhelm	any	other	benefit	you	could	hope	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	.
and	even	if	you	just	look	at	the	current	people	,	and	 ignor 	 e 	 	the	potential	that	would	be	lost	if	we	went	extinct	,	it	should	still	have	a	high	 prior 	 ity 	 	.
now	,	let	me	 s 	 pend 	 	the	rest	of	my	time	on	the	third	big	problem	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	more	subtle	and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	difficult	to	grasp	.
think	about	some	time	in	your	life	--	some	people	might	never	have	 experience 	 d 	 	it	--	but	some	people	,	there	are	just	 t 	 hose 	 	 moment 	 s 	 	that	you	have	 experience 	 d 	 	where	life	was	fantastic	.
it	might	have	 be 	 en 	 	at	the	moment	of	some	great	,	creative	inspiration	you	might	have	had	when	you	just	 enter 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	flow	stage	.
or	when	you	 under 	 stood 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	you	had	never	 d 	 one 	 	before	.	or	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	in	the	 ecstas 	 y 	 	of	romantic	love	.
or	an	aesthetic	experience	--	a	 s 	 un 	 set 	 	or	a	great	piece	of	art	.
every	once	in	a	while	we	have	these	 moment 	 s 	 	,	and	we	 real 	 ize 	 	just	how	good	life	can	be	when	it	's	at	 it 	 s 	 	best	.
and	you	wonder	,	why	ca	n't	it	be	like	that	all	the	time	?
you	just	want	to	 cl 	 ing 	 	onto	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	then	,	of	course	,	it	 drift 	 s 	 	back	 in 	 to 	 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	life	and	the	 memor 	 y 	 	 fad 	 es 	 	.
and	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	difficult	to	recall	,	in	a	normal	frame	of	mind	,	just	how	good	life	can	be	at	 it 	 s 	 	best	.
or	how	bad	it	can	be	at	 it 	 s 	 	worst	.
the	third	big	problem	is	that	life	is	n't	 usual 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	could	be	.
i	think	that	's	a	big	,	big	problem	.
it	's	easy	to	say	what	we	do	n't	want	.
here	are	a	number	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	do	n't	want	--	 ill 	 ness 	 	,	 in 	 voluntary 	 	death	,	 un 	 necess 	 ary 	 	 suffer 	 ing 	 	,	 cruel 	 ty 	 	,	 stunt 	 ed 	 	growth	,	 memor 	 y 	 	loss	,	 ignor 	 ance 	 	,	 ab 	 s 	 ence 	 	of	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	.
suppose	we	 fix 	 ed 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	--	we	did	 some 	 thing 	 	about	all	of	these	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	.
we	got	rid	of	all	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
we	might	end	up	with	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,
which	is	--	i	mean	,	it	's	a	heck	of	a	lot	better	than	that	.
but	is	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	the	best	we	can	dream	of	?
is	 th 	 is 	 	the	best	we	can	do	?
or	is	it	possible	to	find	 some 	 thing 	 	a	little	bit	more	inspiring	to	work	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	?
and	if	we	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	think	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	that	there	are	ways	in	which	we	could	change	 thing 	 s 	 	,	not	just	by	 elimi 	 nating 	 	 negative 	 s 	 	,	but	 add 	 ing 	 	 positive 	 s 	 	.
on	my	wish	list	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	,	would	be	:	much	 long 	 er 	 	,	 health 	 ier 	 	 live 	 s 	 	,	 great 	 er 	 	 subject 	 ive 	 	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	,	 enhance 	 d 	 	cognitive	 cap 	 a 	 cities 	 	,	more	knowledge	and	 understand 	 ing 	 	,	 un 	 limit 	 ed 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	for	personal	growth	beyond	our	current	 bio 	 logical 	 	 limit 	 s 	 	,	better	 relationship 	 s 	 	,	an	 un 	 bound 	 ed 	 	potential	for	spiritual	,	moral	and	intellectual	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
if	we	want	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	what	,	in	the	world	,	would	have	to	change	?
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	answer	--	we	would	have	to	change	.
not	just	the	world	around	us	,	but	we	,	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
not	just	the	way	we	think	about	the	world	,	but	the	way	we	are	--	our	 ver 	 y 	 	biology	.
human	nature	would	have	to	change	.
now	,	when	we	think	about	changing	human	nature	,	the	first	thing	that	 come 	 s 	 	to	mind	are	these	human	 mod 	 ification 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	--	growth	hormone	therapy	,	cosmetic	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	,	 stimul 	 ants 	 	like	ritalin	,	adderall	,	anti	-	depressants	,	 ana 	 bolic 	 	 steroid 	 s 	 	,	artificial	 heart 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	pathetic	list	.
they	do	great	 thing 	 s 	 	for	a	few	people	who	suffer	from	some	specific	condition	,
but	for	most	people	,	they	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	transform	what	it	is	to	be	human	.	and	they	 al 	 so 	 	all	seem	a	little	bit	--	most	people	have	 th 	 is 	 	instinct	that	,	well	,	 s 	 ure 	 	,	there	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	anti	-	depressants	for	the	 re 	 ally 	 	 depress 	 ed 	 	people	.
but	there	's	a	kind	of	 que 	 a 	 s 	 iness 	 	that	these	are	 un 	 natural 	 	in	some	way	.
it	's	worth	 recall 	 ing 	 	that	there	are	a	lot	of	other	 mod 	 ification 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	and	 enhance 	 ment 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	that	we	use	.
we	have	skin	 enhance 	 ments 	 	,	 cloth 	 ing 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	i	can	see	,	all	of	you	are	 user 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 enhance 	 ment 	 	technology	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	so	that	's	a	great	thing	.
mood	 modifi 	 ers 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	used	from	time	 im 	 memorial 	 	--	 c 	 affe 	 ine 	 	,	alcohol	,	 nic 	 ot 	 ine 	 	,	 immun 	 e 	 	system	 enhance 	 ment 	 	,	vision	 enhance 	 ment 	 	,	 anesthet 	 ic 	 s 	 	--
we	take	that	 ver 	 y 	 	much	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	,	but	just	think	about	how	great	progress	that	is	--	like	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	an	operation	before	 anesthet 	 ic 	 s 	 	was	not	 f 	 un 	 	.
 con 	 traceptives 	 	,	 cosmetic 	 s 	 	and	brain	 re 	 programm 	 ing 	 	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	--	that	 sound 	 s 	 	ominous	,
but	the	 distinct 	 ion 	 	between	what	is	a	technology	--	a	gadget	would	be	the	 arche 	 type 	 	--	and	other	ways	of	changing	and	 re 	 writing 	 	human	nature	is	 quit 	 e 	 	subtle	.
so	if	you	think	about	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	to	learn	arithmetic	or	to	learn	to	read	,	you	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	 re 	 writing 	 	your	own	brain	.
you	're	changing	the	 micro 	 structure 	 	of	your	brain	 a 	 s 	 	you	go	 a 	 long 	 	.
so	in	a	broad	sense	,	we	do	n't	need	to	think	about	technology	 a 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	little	 gadget 	 s 	 	,	like	these	 thing 	 s 	 	here	,
but	even	 institution 	 s 	 	and	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	,	 psycho 	 logical 	 	 method 	 s 	 	and	so	forth	.
 form 	 s 	 	of	 organ 	 ization 	 	can	have	a	 pro 	 found 	 	impact	on	human	nature	.
looking	 a 	 head 	 	,	there	is	a	range	of	 techno 	 logies 	 	that	are	 al 	 most 	 	certain	to	be	 develop 	 ed 	 	 soon 	 er 	 	or	 lat 	 er 	 	.
we	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 ignor 	 ant 	 	about	what	the	time	scale	for	these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	,
but	they	all	are	 consist 	 ent 	 	with	 every 	 thing 	 	we	know	about	physical	 law 	 s 	 	,	 law 	 s 	 	of	 chemist 	 ry 	 	,	etc	.
it	's	possible	to	 assum 	 e 	 	,	setting	 a 	 side 	 	a	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	 catastroph 	 e 	 	,	that	 soon 	 er 	 	or	 lat 	 er 	 	we	will	develop	all	of	these	.
and	even	just	a	couple	of	these	would	be	 en 	 ough 	 	to	transform	the	human	condition	.
so	let	's	look	at	some	of	the	 dimension 	 s 	 	of	human	nature	that	seem	to	 leav 	 e 	 	room	for	 improve 	 ment 	 	.
health	span	is	a	big	and	 urge 	 nt 	 	thing	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	're	not	 al 	 ive 	 	,	then	all	the	other	 thing 	 s 	 	will	be	to	little	avail	.
intellectual	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	--	let	's	take	that	box	,	which	 fall 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	lot	of	different	sub	-	 categor 	 ies 	 	:	 memor 	 y 	 	,	 concent 	 ration 	 	,	mental	energy	,	 intellig 	 ence 	 	,	 empath 	 y 	 	.
these	are	 re 	 ally 	 	great	 thing 	 s 	 	.
part	of	the	reason	why	we	value	these	 trait 	 s 	 	is	that	they	make	us	better	at	 com 	 pet 	 ing 	 	with	other	people	--	they	're	 position 	 al 	 	 good 	 s 	 	.
but	part	of	the	reason	--	and	that	's	the	reason	why	we	have	 ethic 	 al 	 	ground	for	 pur 	 suing 	 	these	--	is	that	they	're	 al 	 so 	 	 intrinsic 	 ally 	 	 valu 	 able 	 	.
it	's	just	better	to	be	able	to	understand	more	of	the	world	around	you	and	the	people	that	you	are	 commun 	 ic 	 ating 	 	with	,	and	to	remember	what	you	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	.
 mod 	 al 	 ities 	 	and	special	 facul 	 ties 	 	.
now	,	the	human	mind	is	not	a	single	 unit 	 ary 	 	information	processor	,
but	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	different	,	special	,	 evolv 	 ed 	 	 modul 	 es 	 	that	do	specific	 thing 	 s 	 	for	us	.
if	you	think	about	what	we	 normal 	 ly 	 	take	 a 	 s 	 	giving	life	a	lot	of	 it 	 s 	 	meaning	--	music	,	humor	,	 er 	 otic 	 ism 	 	,	 spiritual 	 ity 	 	,	 aesthetic 	 s 	 	,	 nurtur 	 ing 	 	and	 car 	 ing 	 	,	gossip	,	 chat 	 ting 	 	with	people	--
all	of	these	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 like 	 ly 	 	,	are	enabled	by	a	special	 circuit 	 ry 	 	that	we	 human 	 s 	 	have	,	but	that	you	could	have	 an 	 other 	 	intelligent	life	form	that	 lack 	 s 	 	these	.
we	're	just	 luck 	 y 	 	that	we	have	the	requisite	neural	 machine 	 ry 	 	to	process	music	and	to	appreciate	it	and	enjoy	it	.
all	of	these	would	 en 	 able 	 	,	in	principle	--	be	 a 	 men 	 able 	 	to	 enhance 	 ment 	 	.
some	people	have	a	better	musical	ability	and	ability	to	appreciate	music	than	 other 	 s 	 	have	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	think	about	what	other	 thing 	 s 	 	are	--	so	if	these	all	enabled	great	 value 	 s 	 	,	why	should	we	think	that	evolution	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	provide	us	with	all	the	 mod 	 al 	 ities 	 	we	would	need	to	engage	with	other	 value 	 s 	 	that	there	might	be	?
imagine	a	species	that	just	did	n't	have	 th 	 is 	 	neural	 machine 	 ry 	 	for	 process 	 ing 	 	music	.
and	they	would	just	 star 	 e 	 	at	us	with	 baffl 	 ement 	 	when	we	 s 	 pend 	 	time	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	performance	,	like	the	one	we	just	heard	--	 be 	 cause 	 	of	people	making	stupid	 move 	 ments 	 	,
and	they	would	be	 re 	 ally 	 	 irrit 	 ated 	 	and	would	n't	see	what	we	 we 	 re 	 	up	to	.
but	 may 	 be 	 	they	have	 an 	 other 	 	 facul 	 ty 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	else	that	would	seem	 equal 	 ly 	 	irrational	to	us	,	but	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	tap	 in 	 to 	 	some	great	possible	value	there	.
but	we	are	just	 liter 	 ally 	 	deaf	to	that	kind	of	value	.
so	we	could	think	of	 add 	 ing 	 	on	different	,	new	 sensor 	 y 	 	 cap 	 a 	 cities 	 	and	mental	 facul 	 ties 	 	.

able	to	 s 	 witch 	 	back	and	forth	more	 eas 	 ily 	 	would	be	a	neat	thing	to	be	able	to	do	--	 eas 	 ier 	 	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	the	flow	state	,	when	you	're	 total 	 ly 	 	 immers 	 ed 	 	in	 some 	 thing 	 	you	are	 do 	 ing 	 	.

the	ability	to	--	it	's	 an 	 other 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	application	that	would	have	large	social	 ram 	 ification 	 	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	.
if	you	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	 choos 	 e 	 	to	preserve	your	romantic	 attach 	 ments 	 	to	one	person	,	 un 	 diminish 	 ed 	 	through	time	,	so	that	would	n't	have	to	--	love	would	never	have	to	 fad 	 e 	 	if	you	did	n't	want	it	to	.
that	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	not	all	that	difficult	.
it	might	just	be	a	simple	hormone	or	 some 	 thing 	 	that	could	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	in	 vol 	 es 	 	.
you	can	engineer	a	prairie	 vol 	 e 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	 mono 	 gam 	 ous 	 	when	it	's	 natural 	 ly 	 	 poly 	 gam 	 ous 	 	.
it	's	just	a	single	gene	.
might	be	more	 complic 	 ated 	 	in	 human 	 s 	 	,	but	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	not	that	much	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	last	picture	that	i	want	to	--	now	we	've	got	to	use	the	laser	 point 	 er 	 	.
a	possible	mode	of	 be 	 ing 	 	here	would	be	a	way	of	life	--	a	way	of	 be 	 ing 	 	,	 ex 	 peri 	 encing 	 	,	 think 	 ing 	 	,	 see 	 ing 	 	,	 interact 	 ing 	 	with	the	world	.
down	here	in	 th 	 is 	 	little	corner	,	here	,	we	have	the	little	sub	-	space	of	 th 	 is 	 	 large 	 r 	 	space	that	is	 access 	 ible 	 	to	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	--	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	with	our	 bio 	 logical 	 	 cap 	 a 	 cities 	 	.
it	's	a	part	of	the	space	that	's	 access 	 ible 	 	to	 animal 	 s 	 	;	since	we	are	 animal 	 s 	 	,	we	are	a	 sub 	 set 	 	of	that	.
and	then	you	can	imagine	some	 enhance 	 ments 	 	of	human	 cap 	 a 	 cities 	 	.
there	would	be	different	 mode 	 s 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	you	could	experience	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	stay	 al 	 ive 	 	for	,	say	,	200	 year 	 s 	 	.
then	you	could	live	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 live 	 s 	 	and	 accumul 	 ate 	 	 wis 	 dom 	 s 	 	that	are	just	not	possible	for	 human 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	 current 	 ly 	 	are	.
so	then	,	you	move	off	to	 th 	 is 	 	 large 	 r 	 	sphere	of	``	human	+	,	``	and	you	could	 continu 	 e 	 	that	process	and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	explore	a	lot	of	 th 	 is 	 	 large 	 r 	 	space	of	possible	 mode 	 s 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	.
now	,	why	is	that	a	good	thing	to	do	?
well	,	we	know	 al 	 ready 	 	that	in	 th 	 is 	 	little	human	circle	there	,	there	are	these	 enormous 	 ly 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	and	 worth 	 while 	 	 mode 	 s 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	--	human	life	at	 it 	 s 	 	best	is	 wonder 	 ful 	 	.
we	have	no	reason	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 with 	 in 	 	 th 	 is 	 	much	,	much	 large 	 r 	 	space	there	would	not	 al 	 so 	 	be	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 worth 	 while 	 	 mode 	 s 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	,
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 one 	 s 	 	that	would	be	way	beyond	our	 wild 	 est 	 	ability	even	to	imagine	or	dream	about	.
and	so	,	to	fix	 th 	 is 	 	third	problem	,	i	think	we	need	--	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	,	 care 	 fully 	 	,	with	 ethic 	 al 	 	 wis 	 dom 	 	and	constraint	--	develop	the	 mean 	 s 	 	that	 en 	 able 	 	us	to	go	out	in	 th 	 is 	 	 large 	 r 	 	space	and	explore	it
and	find	the	great	 value 	 s 	 	that	might	hide	there	.
 thank 	 s 	 	.
