i	just	want	to	say	my	name	is	emmanuel	jal	.
and	i	come	from	a	long	way	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 tell 	 ing 	 	a	story	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	so	 pain 	 ful 	 	for	me	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	tough	journey	for	me	,	 travel 	 ing 	 	the	world	,	 tell 	 ing 	 	my	story	in	form	of	a	book	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	 tell 	 ing 	 	it	like	now	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	,	the	 eas 	 iest 	 	one	was	when	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	it	in	form	of	a	music	.
so	i	have	 brand 	 ed 	 	 my 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	war	child	.
i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	an	old	 lad 	 y 	 	in	my	village	now	,	who	have	lost	her	children	.
there	is	no	 news 	 paper 	 	to	cover	her	pain	,	and	what	she	 want 	 s 	 	to	change	in	 th 	 is 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
and	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	it	for	a	young	man	who	want	to	create	a	change	and	 ha 	 s 	 	no	way	to	project	his	voice	 be 	 cause 	 	he	ca	n't	write	.	or	there	is	no	 inter 	 net 	 	,	like	facebook	,	myspace	,	youtube	,	for	them	to	talk	.
 al 	 so 	 	one	thing	that	 ke 	 pt 	 	me	 push 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	story	,
 th 	 is 	 	 pain 	 ful 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	out	,	the	 dream 	 s 	 	i	have	,
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	is	like	the	 voice 	 s 	 	of	the	dead	,	that	i	have	 s 	 een 	 	would	tell	me	,	``	do	n't	give	up	.	keep	on	going	.	``
 be 	 cause 	 	 some 	 time 	 	i	feel	like	 stop 	 ping 	 	and	not	 do 	 ing 	 	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	did	n't	know	what	i	was	 put 	 ting 	 	 my 	 self 	 	 in 	 to 	 	.
well	i	was	born	in	the	most	difficult	time	,	when	my	country	was	at	war	.
i	saw	my	village	 burn 	 ed 	 	down	.	the	world	that	 me 	 ant 	 	a	lot	to	me	,	i	saw	it	vanish	in	my	face	.
i	saw	my	aunt	in	rape	when	i	was	 on 	 ly 	 	five	.
my	mother	was	 claim 	 ed 	 	by	the	war	.
my	 brother 	 s 	 	and	 sister 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 scatter 	 ed 	 	.
and	up	to	now	,	me	and	my	father	 we 	 re 	 	 detach 	 ed 	 	and	i	still	have	 issue 	 s 	 	with	him	.
 see 	 ing 	 	people	die	every	day	,	my	mother	 cry 	 ing 	 	,
it	's	like	i	was	raised	in	a	violence	.
and	that	made	me	call	 my 	 self 	 	a	war	child	.
and	not	 on 	 ly 	 	that	,	when	i	was	eight	i	 be 	 came 	 	a	child	soldier	.
i	did	n't	know	what	was	the	war	for	.
but	one	thing	i	 k 	 new 	 
was	an	image	that	i	saw	that	 s 	 tuck 	 	in	my	head	.
when	i	went	to	the	training	camp	i	say	,	``	i	want	to	kill	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	muslims	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	arabs	,	 a 	 s 	 	possible	.	``
the	training	was	n't	easy	,	but	that	was	the	 driv 	 ing 	 	force	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 re 	 venge 	 	for	my	family	.	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 re 	 venge 	 	for	my	village	.
 luck 	 ily 	 	now	 thing 	 s 	 	have	 change 	 d 	 
 be 	 cause 	 	i	came	to	discover	the	truth	.
what	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 kill 	 ing 	 	us	was	n't	the	muslims	,	was	n't	the	arabs	.
it	was	 some 	 body 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	 some 	 where 	 	 manipul 	 ating 	 	the	system	,
and	using	 relig 	 ion 	 	to	get	what	they	want	to	get	out	of	us	,
which	is	the	oil	,	the	diamond	,	the	gold	and	the	land	.
so	 real 	 izing 	 	the	truth	 g 	 ave 	 	me	a	position	to	 choos 	 e 	 	:	should	i	 continu 	 e 	 	to	hate	,	or	let	it	go	?
so	i	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	forgive	.	now	i	 s 	 ing 	 	music	with	the	muslims	.	i	dance	with	them	.
i	even	had	a	movie	out	 call 	 ed 	 	``	war	child	,	``	funded	by	muslim	people	.
so	that	pain	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	out	.
but	my	story	is	huge	.
so	i	'm	just	going	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	a	different	step	now	,
which	is	 eas 	 ier 	 	for	me	.
i	'm	going	to	give	you	poem	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 force 	 d 	 	to	 s 	 in 	 	,	``
which	is	from	my	 al 	 bum 	 	``	war	child	.	``
i	talk	about	my	story	.	one	of	the	journey	that	i	tread	when	i	was	 tempt 	 ed 	 	to	eat	my	friend	 be 	 cause 	 	we	had	no	food
and	we	 we 	 re 	 	like	around	400	.
and	 on 	 ly 	 	16	people	 surviv 	 ed 	 	that	journey	.
so	i	hope	you	're	going	to	hear	 th 	 is 	 	.
my	 dream 	 s 	 	are	like	 tor 	 ment 	 	.	my	every	moment	.	 voice 	 s 	 	in	my	brain	,	of	 friend 	 s 	 	that	was	 s 	 lain 	 	.
 friend 	 s 	 	like	lual	who	 di 	 ed 	 	by	my	side	,	of	 starv 	 ation 	 	.
in	the	 burn 	 ing 	 	jungle	,	and	the	desert	plain	.	next	was	i	,	but	jesus	heard	my	cry	.	 a 	 s 	 	i	was	 tempt 	 ed 	 	to	eat	the	 rot 	 ten 	 	 fl 	 esh 	 	of	my	comrade	,
he	 g 	 ave 	 	me	comfort	.
we	used	to	raid	 village 	 s 	 	,	 steal 	 ing 	 	 chicken 	 s 	 	,	 goat 	 s 	 	and	 sheep 	 s 	 	,
 any 	 thing 	 	we	could	eat	.
i	 k 	 new 	 	it	was	rude	,	but	we	 need 	 ed 	 	food	.
and	 there 	 fore 	 	i	was	 force 	 d 	 	to	 s 	 in 	 	,	 force 	 d 	 	to	 s 	 in 	 	to	make	a	living	,
 force 	 d 	 	to	 s 	 in 	 	to	make	a	living	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	you	got	ta	lose	to	win	.
never	give	up	.	never	give	in	.
left	home	at	the	age	of	seven	.	one	year	 lat 	 er 	 	,	live	with	an	ak	-	47	by	my	side	.	slept	with	one	eye	open	wide	.
run	,	duck	,	play	dead	and	hide	.
i	've	 s 	 een 	 	my	people	die	like	flies	.
but	i	've	never	 s 	 een 	 	a	dead	body	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	one	that	i	've	 kill 	 ed 	 	.
but	still	 a 	 s 	 	i	wonder	,	i	wo	n't	go	under	.
 gun 	 s 	 	 bark 	 ing 	 	like	 light 	 ning 	 	and	thunder	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	child	so	young	and	tender	,	 word 	 s 	 	i	ca	n't	forget	i	still	remember	.
i	saw	 s 	 er 	 ge 	 ant 	 	command	raising	his	hand	,	no	 re 	 treat 	 	,	no	surrender	.
i	carry	the	 bann 	 er 	 	of	the	trauma	.
war	child	,	child	 with 	 out 	 	a	mama	,	still	 fight 	 ing 	 	in	the	 s 	 aga 	 	.
yet	 a 	 s 	 	i	wage	 th 	 is 	 	new	war	i	'm	not	 al 	 one 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	drama	.
no	 s 	 it 	 	or	stop	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	reach	for	the	top	i	'm	fully	 dedicate 	 d 	 	like	a	 patriot 	 ic 	 	cop	.
i	'm	on	a	fight	,	day	and	night	.
 some 	 time 	 	i	do	wrong	in	order	to	make	 thing 	 s 	 	right	.
it	's	like	i	'm	living	a	dream	.
first	time	i	'm	 feel 	 ing 	 	like	a	human	 be 	 ing 	 	.
ah	!	the	children	of	darfur	.
your	empty	 bell 	 ies 	 	on	the	 tell 	 y 	 	and	now	it	's	you	that	i	'm	 fight 	 ing 	 	for	.
left	home	.
do	n't	even	know	the	day	i	'll	ever	return	.
my	country	is	war	-	torn	.
music	i	used	to	hear	was	 bomb 	 s 	 	and	fire	of	 gun 	 s 	 	.
so	 man 	 y 	 	people	die	that	i	do	n't	even	cry	no	more	.
ask	god	question	,	what	am	i	here	for	.	and	why	are	my	people	poor	.	and	why	,	why	when	the	rest	of	the	children	 we 	 re 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	how	to	read	and	write	,	i	was	 learn 	 ing 	 	how	to	fight	.	i	ate	 s 	 nail 	 s 	 	,	 vulture 	 s 	 	,	 rabbi 	 ts 	 	,	 snake 	 s 	 	,	and	 any 	 thing 	 	that	had	life	.	i	was	ready	to	eat	.
i	know	it	's	a	shame	.	but	who	is	to	be	 blame 	 d 	 	?
thank	you	.
what	 energ 	 ized 	 	me	and	 ke 	 pt 	 	me	going	is	the	music	i	do	.
i	never	saw	 any 	 body 	 	to	tell	my	story	to	them	so	they	could	advise	me	or	do	therapy	.
so	the	music	had	 be 	 en 	 	my	therapy	for	me	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	where	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	heaven	,
where	i	can	be	happy	,	where	i	can	be	a	child	 aga 	 in 	 	,	in	 dance 	 s 	 	,	through	music	.
so	one	thing	i	know	about	music	:
music	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	that	 ha 	 s 	 	power	to	enter	your	cell	system	,	your	mind	,	your	heart	,	influence	your	soul	and	your	spirit	,
and	can	even	influence	the	way	you	live	 with 	 out 	 	even	you	 know 	 ing 	 	.
music	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	that	can	make	you	want	to	wake	up	your	bed	and	shake	your	leg	,	 with 	 out 	 	even	 want 	 ing 	 	to	do	it	.
and	so	the	power	music	 ha 	 s 	 	i	 normal 	 ly 	 	 compar 	 e 	 	to	the	power	love
when	love	 do 	 es 	 	n't	see	a	color	.
you	know	,	if	you	fall	in	love	with	a	frog	,	that	's	it	.
one	 test 	 im 	 ony 	 	about	how	i	find	music	is	 power 	 ful 	 	is	when
i	was	still	a	soldier	back	then	.	i	 hat 	 ed 	 	the	people	in	the	north	.
but	i	do	n't	know	why	i	do	n't	hate	 the 	 ir 	 	music	.
so	we	party	and	dance	to	 the 	 ir 	 	music	.
and	one	thing	that	 shock 	 ed 	 	me	is	one	day
they	 br 	 ought 	 	an	arab	 music 	 ian 	 	to	come	and	entertain	the	 soldier 	 s 	 	.	and	i	 al 	 most 	 	broke	my	leg	 danc 	 ing 	 	to	his	music	.
but	i	had	 th 	 is 	 	question	.
so	now	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	music	so	i	know	what	the	power	of	music	is	.
so	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	here	?
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	in	a	 pain 	 ful 	 	journey	.
 to 	 day 	 	is	day	number	233	in	which	i	 on 	 ly 	 	eat	 d 	 inner 	 	.
i	do	n't	eat	 break 	 fast 	 	.	no	lunch	.
and	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	a	campaign	 call 	 ed 	 	lose	to	win	.	where	i	'm	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	so	that	i	could	win	the	battle	that	i	'm	 fight 	 ing 	 	now	.
so	my	 break 	 fast 	 	,	my	lunch	,	i	 don 	 ate 	 	it	to	a	 char 	 ity 	 	that	i	 found 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	want	to	build	a	school	in	sudan	.
and	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 al 	 so 	 	it	's	a	normal	thing	in	my	home	,	people	eat	one	meal	a	day	.
here	i	am	in	the	west	.	i	 choos 	 e 	 	not	to	.
so	in	my	village	now	,	 kid 	 s 	 	there	,	they	 normal 	 ly 	 	listen	to	bbc	,	or	any	radio	,	and	they	are	 wait 	 ing 	 	to	know	,	the	day	emmanuel	will	eat	his	 break 	 fast 	 
it	 mean 	 s 	 	he	got	the	money	to	build	our	school	.
and	so	i	made	a	 commit 	 ment 	 	.	i	say	,	``	i	'm	gon	na	not	eat	my	 break 	 fast 	 	.	``
i	thought	i	was	famous	 en 	 ough 	 	that	i	would	raise	the	money	 with 	 in 	 	one	month	,	but	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 humble 	 d 	 	.	so	it	's	taken	me	232	 day 	 s 	 	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	stop	 un 	 til 	 	we	get	it	.	``
and	like	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	on	facebook	,	myspace	.
the	people	are	giving	three	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
the	 low 	 est 	 	amount	we	ever	got	was	20	 cent 	 s 	 	.
 some 	 body 	 	 don 	 ated 	 	20	 cent 	 s 	 	 on 	 line 	 	.	i	do	n't	know	how	they	did	it	.
but	that	 move 	 d 	 	me	.
and	so	,	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	education	to	me
is	what	i	'm	 will 	 ing 	 	to	die	for	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	know	what	it	can	do	to	my	people	.
education	enlighten	your	brain	,	give	you	so	 man 	 y 	 	 chance 	 s 	 	,	and	you	're	able	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	nation	we	have	 be 	 en 	 	 c 	 rippl 	 ed 	 	.
for	so	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	we	have	fed	on	aid	.
you	see	a	20	-	 year 	 s 	 	-	old	,	30	-	 year 	 s 	 	-	old	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	in	a	 refuge 	 e 	 	 camp 	 s 	 	.
they	 on 	 ly 	 	get	the	food	that	 drop 	 s 	 	from	the	sky	,	from	the	u.n	.
so	these	people	,	you	're	 kill 	 ing 	 	a	whole	generation	if	you	just	give	them	aid	.
if	 any 	 body 	 	want	to	help	us	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	need	.
give	us	 tool 	 s 	 	.	give	the	 farm 	 ers 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	.
it	's	rain	.	africa	is	 fertil 	 e 	 	.	they	can	grow	the	 crop 	 s 	 	.
invest	in	education	.
education	so	that	we	have	strong	institution	that	can	create	a	revolution	to	change	 every 	 thing 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	all	 t 	 hose 	 	old	men	that	are	creating	 war 	 s 	 	in	africa	.	they	will	die	soon	.
but	if	you	invest	in	education	then	we	'll	be	able	to	change	africa	.
that	's	what	i	'm	 ask 	 ing 	 	.
so	in	order	to	do	that	,	i	 found 	 ed 	 	a	 chart 	 er 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	gua	africa	,
where	we	put	 kid 	 s 	 	in	school	.
and	now	we	have	a	couple	in	university	.
we	have	like	40	 kid 	 s 	 	,	ex	-	child	 soldier 	 s 	 	 mix 	 ed 	 	with	 any 	 body 	 	that	we	feel	like	we	want	to	support	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	``	i	'm	going	to	put	it	in	practice	.	``	and	with	the	people	that	are	going	to	follow	me	and	help	me	do	 thing 	 s 	 	.
that	's	what	i	want	to	do	to	change	,	to	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	the	world	.
well	now	,	my	time	is	going	,	so	i	want	to	 s 	 ing 	 	a	song	.
but	i	'll	ask	you	 guy 	 s 	 	to	stand	up	so	we	 celebr 	 ate 	 	the	life	of	a	british	aid	 work 	 er 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	emma	mccune
that	made	it	possible	for	me	to	be	here	.
i	'm	gon	na	 s 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	song	,	just	to	inspire	you	how	 th 	 is 	 	woman	 ha 	 s 	 	made	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
she	came	to	my	country	and	saw	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	education	.
she	 s 	 aid 	 	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	to	help	sudan	is	to	invest	in	the	women	,	 educ 	 ating 	 	them	,	 educ 	 ating 	 	the	children	,
so	that	they	could	come	and	create	a	revolution	in	 th 	 is 	 	complex	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
so	she	even	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 marry 	 ing 	 	a	 command 	 er 	 	from	the	spla	.
and	she	 rescu 	 ed 	 	over	150	child	 soldier 	 s 	 	.
one	of	them	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	be	me	now	.
and	so	at	 th 	 is 	 	moment	i	want	to	ask	to	 celebr 	 ate 	 	emma	with	me	.
are	you	 guy 	 s 	 	ready	to	 celebr 	 ate 	 	emma	?
