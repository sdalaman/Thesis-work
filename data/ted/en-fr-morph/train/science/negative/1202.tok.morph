do	you	know	that	we	have	1.4	million	cellular	radio	 mast 	 s 	 	 deploy 	 ed 	 	 world 	 wide 	 	?
and	these	are	base	 station 	 s 	 	.
and	we	 al 	 so 	 	have	more	than	five	billion	of	these	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	here	.
these	are	cellular	mobile	 phone 	 s 	 	.
and	with	these	mobile	 phone 	 s 	 	,	we	transmit	more	than	600	 tera 	 byte 	 s 	 	of	data	every	month	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	6	with	14	 zero 	 es 	 	--	a	 ver 	 y 	 	large	number	.
and	 wire 	 less 	 	 communication 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	a	 util 	 ity 	 	like	 electric 	 ity 	 	and	water	.
we	use	it	 every 	 day 	 	.	we	use	it	in	our	 every 	 day 	 	 live 	 s 	 	now	--	in	our	private	 live 	 s 	 	,	in	our	business	 live 	 s 	 	.
and	we	even	have	to	be	 ask 	 ed 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 kind 	 ly 	 	,	to	 s 	 witch 	 	off	the	mobile	phone	at	 event 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	for	good	 reason 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	 th 	 is 	 	 import 	 ance 	 	why	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	look	 in 	 to 	 	the	 issue 	 s 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	technology	 ha 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	so	fundamental	to	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
and	one	of	the	 issue 	 s 	 	is	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	.
the	way	we	transmit	 wire 	 less 	 	data	is	by	using	 electro 	 magnet 	 ic 	 	 wave 	 s 	 	--	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	radio	 wave 	 s 	 	.
and	radio	 wave 	 s 	 	are	 limit 	 ed 	 	.
they	are	scarce	;	they	are	expensive	;	and	we	 on 	 ly 	 	have	a	certain	range	of	it	.
and	it	's	 th 	 is 	 	 limit 	 ation 	 	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	cope	with	the	demand	of	 wire 	 less 	 	data	 trans 	 mission 	 s 	 	and	the	number	of	 byte 	 s 	 	and	data	which	are	 transmit 	 ted 	 	every	month	.
and	we	are	 simpl 	 y 	 	running	out	of	spectrum	.
there	's	 an 	 other 	 	problem	.
that	is	efficiency	.
these	1.4	million	cellular	radio	 mast 	 s 	 	,	or	base	 station 	 s 	 	,	 consum 	 e 	 	a	lot	of	energy	.
and	mind	you	,	most	of	the	energy	is	not	used	to	transmit	the	radio	 wave 	 s 	 	,	it	is	used	to	cool	the	base	 station 	 s 	 	.
then	the	efficiency	of	 s 	 uch 	 	a	base	station	is	 on 	 ly 	 	at	about	five	percent	.
and	that	 create 	 s 	 	a	big	problem	.
then	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	issue	that	you	're	all	aware	of	.
you	have	to	 s 	 witch 	 	off	your	mobile	phone	 dur 	 ing 	 	 flight 	 s 	 	.
in	 hospital 	 s 	 	,	they	are	security	 issue 	 s 	 	.
and	security	is	 an 	 other 	 	issue	.
these	radio	 wave 	 s 	 	penetrate	through	 wall 	 s 	 	.
they	can	be	 inter 	 cept 	 ed 	 	,	and	 some 	 body 	 	can	make	use	of	your	network	if	he	 ha 	 s 	 	bad	 intent 	 ions 	 	.
so	these	are	the	main	four	 issue 	 s 	 	.
but	on	the	other	hand	,	we	have	14	billion	of	these	:	light	 bulb 	 s 	 	,	light	.
and	light	is	part	of	the	 electro 	 magnet 	 ic 	 	spectrum	.
so	let	's	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	 con 	 text 	 	of	the	entire	 electro 	 magnet 	 ic 	 	spectrum	,	where	we	have	 gam 	 ma 	 	 ray 	 s 	 	.
you	do	n't	want	to	get	close	to	 gam 	 ma 	 	 ray 	 s 	 	,	it	could	be	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
x	-	 ray 	 s 	 	,	 use 	 ful 	 	when	you	go	to	 hospital 	 s 	 	.
then	there	's	 ultra 	 viol 	 et 	 	light	.
it	's	good	for	a	nice	 s 	 un 	 tan 	 	,	but	 other 	 wise 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	for	the	human	body	.
 infra 	 red 	 	--	due	to	eye	 safe 	 ty 	 	 regulat 	 ions 	 	,	can	be	 on 	 ly 	 	used	with	low	power	.
and	then	we	have	the	radio	 wave 	 s 	 	,	they	have	the	 issue 	 s 	 	i	've	just	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	.
and	in	the	middle	there	,	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	visible	light	spectrum	.
it	's	light	,
and	light	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	around	for	 man 	 y 	 	 million 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	in	fact	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 create 	 d 	 	us	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 create 	 d 	 	life	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 create 	 d 	 	all	the	stuff	of	life	.
so	it	's	 inherent 	 ly 	 	safe	to	use	.
and	would	n't	it	be	great	to	use	that	for	 wire 	 less 	 	 communication 	 s 	 	?
not	 on 	 ly 	 	that	,	i	 compar 	 ed 	 	[	it	to	]	the	entire	spectrum	.
i	 compar 	 ed 	 	the	radio	 wave 	 s 	 	spectrum	--	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	it	--	with	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	visible	light	spectrum	.
and	guess	what	?
we	have	10,000	 time 	 s 	 	more	of	that	spectrum	,	which	is	there	for	us	to	use	.
so	not	 on 	 ly 	 	do	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	huge	amount	of	spectrum	,	let	's	 compar 	 e 	 	that	with	a	number	i	've	just	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	.
we	have	1.4	million	 expensive 	 ly 	 	 deploy 	 ed 	 	,	 in 	 efficient 	 	radio	cellular	base	 station 	 s 	 	.
and	 multi 	 ply 	 	that	by	10,000	,	then	you	end	up	at	14	billion	.
14	billion	is	the	number	of	light	 bulb 	 s 	 	 install 	 ed 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	.
so	we	have	the	 infra 	 structure 	 	there	.
look	at	the	 ceil 	 ing 	 	,	you	see	all	these	light	 bulb 	 s 	 	.
go	to	the	main	floor	,	you	see	these	light	 bulb 	 s 	 	.
can	we	use	them	for	 communication 	 s 	 	?
 y 	 es 	 	.
what	do	we	need	to	do	?
the	one	thing	we	need	to	do	is	we	have	to	replace	these	 in 	 efficient 	 	 inc 	 and 	 escent 	 	light	 bulb 	 s 	 	,	 flor 	 escent 	 	 light 	 s 	 	,	with	 th 	 is 	 	new	technology	of	led	,	led	light	 bulb 	 s 	 	.
an	led	is	a	 semi 	 conductor 	 	.	it	's	an	 electron 	 ic 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	.
and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	nice	 a 	 cute 	 	 proper 	 ty 	 	.
 it 	 s 	 	 intens 	 ity 	 	can	be	 modul 	 ated 	 	at	 ver 	 y 	 	high	 speed 	 s 	 	,	and	it	can	be	 s 	 witch 	 ed 	 	off	at	 ver 	 y 	 	high	 speed 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	fundamental	 bas 	 ic 	 	 proper 	 ty 	 	that	we	exploit	with	our	technology	.
so	let	's	show	how	we	do	that	.
let	's	go	to	the	 close 	 st 	 	neighbor	to	the	visible	light	spectrum	--	go	to	remote	 control 	 s 	 	.
you	all	know	remote	 control 	 s 	 	have	an	 infra 	 red 	 	led	--	 bas 	 ically 	 	you	 s 	 witch 	 	on	the	led	,	and	if	it	's	off	,	you	 s 	 witch 	 	it	off	.
and	it	 create 	 s 	 	a	simple	,	low	-	speed	data	stream	in	10,000	bits	per	second	,	20,000	bits	per	second	.
not	 us 	 able 	 	for	a	youtube	video	.
what	we	have	 d 	 one 	 	is	we	have	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	technology	with	which	we	can	 further 	 more 	 	replace	the	remote	control	of	our	light	bulb	.
we	transmit	with	our	technology	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	a	single	data	stream	,	we	transmit	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	data	 stream 	 s 	 	in	parallel	,	at	even	 high 	 er 	 	 speed 	 s 	 	.
and	the	technology	we	have	 develop 	 ed 	 	--	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	sim	ofdm	.
and	it	's	spacial	 modul 	 ation 	 	--	these	are	the	 on 	 ly 	 	technical	 term 	 s 	 	,	i	'm	not	going	 in 	 to 	 	 detail 	 s 	 	--	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	we	enabled	that	light	source	to	transmit	data	.
you	will	say	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	nice	--	a	slide	 create 	 d 	 	in	10	 minute 	 s 	 	.	``	but	not	 on 	 ly 	 	that	.
what	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	is	we	have	 al 	 so 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	 demonst 	 rator 	 	.
and	i	'm	 show 	 ing 	 	for	the	first	time	in	public	 th 	 is 	 	visible	light	 demonst 	 rator 	 	.
and	what	we	have	here	is	no	 ordin 	 ary 	 	desk	lamp	.
we	fit	in	an	led	light	bulb	,	worth	three	u.s.	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	put	in	our	signal	 process 	 ing 	 	technology	.
and	then	what	we	have	here	is	a	little	hole	.
and	the	light	 go 	 es 	 	through	that	hole	.
there	's	a	 receiv 	 er 	 	.
the	 receiv 	 er 	 	will	convert	these	little	,	subtle	 change 	 s 	 	in	the	 ampl 	 itude 	 	that	we	create	there	 in 	 to 	 	an	 electric 	 al 	 	signal	.
and	that	signal	is	then	 convert 	 ed 	 	back	to	a	high	-	speed	data	stream	.
in	the	future	we	hope	that	we	can	integrate	 th 	 is 	 	little	hole	 in 	 to 	 	these	smart	 phone 	 s 	 	.
and	not	 on 	 ly 	 	integrate	a	photo	 detect 	 or 	 	here	,	but	 may 	 be 	 	use	the	camera	 in 	 side 	 	.
so	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	i	 s 	 witch 	 	on	that	light	?
 a 	 s 	 	you	would	expect	,	it	's	a	light	,	a	desk	lamp	.
put	your	book	 be 	 neath 	 	it	and	you	can	read	.
it	's	 illumi 	 nating 	 	the	space	.
but	at	the	same	time	,	you	see	 th 	 is 	 	video	coming	up	here	.
and	that	's	a	video	,	a	high	-	definition	video	that	is	 transmit 	 ted 	 	through	that	light	beam	.
you	're	critical	.
you	think	,	``	ha	,	ha	,	ha	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	smart	academic	 do 	 ing 	 	a	little	bit	of	 trick 	 s 	 	here	.	``
but	let	me	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
once	 aga 	 in 	 	.
still	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	?
it	is	 th 	 is 	 	light	that	 transmit 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	high	-	definition	video	in	a	split	stream	.
and	if	you	look	at	the	light	,	it	is	 illumi 	 nating 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	would	expect	.
you	do	n't	notice	with	your	human	eye	.	you	do	n't	notice	the	subtle	 change 	 s 	 	in	the	 ampl 	 itude 	 	that	we	impress	onto	 th 	 is 	 	light	bulb	.
it	's	 serv 	 ing 	 	the	purpose	of	 illumi 	 nation 	 	,	but	at	the	same	time	,	we	are	able	to	transmit	 th 	 is 	 	data	.
and	you	see	,	even	light	from	the	 ceil 	 ing 	 	 come 	 s 	 	down	here	to	the	 receiv 	 er 	 	.
it	can	 ignor 	 e 	 	that	constant	light	,	 be 	 cause 	 	all	the	 receiv 	 er 	 	's	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	are	subtle	 change 	 s 	 	.
you	 al 	 so 	 	have	a	critical	question	now	,	and
you	say	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	do	i	have	to	have	the	light	on	all	the	time	to	have	 th 	 is 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	?	``
and	the	answer	is	 y 	 es 	 	.
but	,	you	can	 d 	 im 	 	down	the	light	to	a	level	that	it	 appear 	 s 	 	to	be	off	.
and	you	are	still	able	to	transmit	data	--	that	's	possible	.
so	i	've	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	to	you	the	four	 challeng 	 es 	 	.
 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	:	we	have	10,000	 time 	 s 	 	more	spectrum	,	10,000	 time 	 s 	 	more	leds	 install 	 ed 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	in	the	 infra 	 structure 	 	there	.
you	would	agree	with	me	,	 hope 	 fully 	 	,	there	's	no	issue	of	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	 any 	 more 	 	.
efficiency	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	data	through	 illumi 	 nation 	 	--	it	's	first	of	all	an	 illumi 	 nation 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	.
and	if	you	do	the	energy	budget	,	the	data	 trans 	 mission 	 	 come 	 s 	 	for	free	--	 high 	 ly 	 	energy	efficient	.
i	do	n't	 ment 	 ion 	 	the	high	energy	efficiency	of	these	led	light	 bulb 	 s 	 	.
if	the	whole	world	would	deploy	them	,	you	would	 s 	 ave 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	power	 plant 	 s 	 	.
that	's	 a 	 side 	 	.
and	then	i	've	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	the	 avail 	 ability 	 	.
you	will	agree	with	me	that	we	have	 light 	 s 	 	in	the	hospital	.
you	need	to	see	what	to	do	.
you	have	 light 	 s 	 	in	an	 air 	 craft 	 	.
so	it	's	 every 	 where 	 	in	a	day	there	is	light	.
look	around	.	 every 	 where 	 	.	look	at	your	smart	phone	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 flash 	 light 	 	,	an	led	 flash 	 light 	 	.
these	are	potential	 source 	 s 	 	for	high	-	speed	data	 trans 	 mission 	 	.
and	then	there	's	security	.
you	would	agree	with	me	that	light	 do 	 es 	 	n't	penetrate	through	 wall 	 s 	 	.
so	no	one	,	if	i	have	a	light	here	,	if	i	have	secure	data	,	no	one	on	the	other	side	of	 th 	 is 	 	room	through	that	wall	would	be	able	to	read	that	data	.
and	there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	data	where	there	is	light	.
so	if	i	do	n't	want	that	 receiv 	 er 	 	to	 receiv 	 e 	 	the	data	,	then	what	i	could	do	,	turn	it	away	.
so	the	data	 go 	 es 	 	in	that	direction	,	not	there	 any 	 more 	 	.
now	we	can	in	fact	see	where	the	data	is	going	to	.
so	for	me	,	the	 application 	 s 	 	of	it	,	to	me	,	are	beyond	 imagin 	 ation 	 	at	the	moment	.
we	have	had	a	century	of	 ver 	 y 	 	nice	,	smart	application	 develop 	 ers 	 	.
and	you	 on 	 ly 	 	have	to	notice	,	where	we	have	light	,	there	is	a	potential	way	to	transmit	data	.
but	i	can	give	you	a	few	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
well	you	may	see	the	impact	 al 	 ready 	 	now	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	remote	 oper 	 ated 	 	vehicle	 be 	 neath 	 	the	ocean	.
and	they	use	light	to	illuminate	space	down	there	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	light	can	be	used	to	transmit	 wire 	 less 	 	data	that	these	 thing 	 s 	 	[	use	]	to	communicate	with	each	other	.
 intrinsic 	 ally 	 	safe	 environment 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	 petro 	 chemical 	 	plant	--	you	ca	n't	use	rf	,	it	may	generate	antenna	 spark 	 s 	 	,	but	you	can	use	light	--	you	see	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	light	there	.
in	 hospital 	 s 	 	,	for	new	medical	 instrument 	 s 	 	;
in	 street 	 s 	 	for	traffic	control	.	 car 	 s 	 	have	led	-	based	 head 	 light 	 s 	 	,	led	-	based	back	 light 	 s 	 	,	and	 car 	 s 	 	can	communicate	with	each	other	and	prevent	 accident 	 s 	 	in	the	way	that	they	 ex 	 change 	 	information	.
traffic	 light 	 s 	 	can	communicate	to	the	car	and	so	on	.	and	then	you	have	these	 million 	 s 	 	of	street	 lamp 	 s 	 	 deploy 	 ed 	 	around	the	world	.
and	every	street	lamp	could	be	a	free	access	point	.
we	call	it	,	in	fact	,	a	li	-	fi	,	light	-	fidelity	.
and	then	we	have	these	 air 	 craft 	 	 cab 	 in 	 s 	 	.
there	are	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 light 	 s 	 	in	an	 air 	 craft 	 	 cab 	 in 	 	,	and	each	of	these	 light 	 s 	 	could	be	a	potential	 transmit 	 ter 	 	of	 wire 	 less 	 	data	.
so	you	could	enjoy	your	most	 favor 	 ite 	 	ted	video	on	your	long	flight	back	home	.
 on 	 line 	 	life	.	so	that	is	a	vision	,	i	think	,	that	is	possible	.
so	,	all	we	would	need	to	do	is	to	fit	a	small	 micro 	 chip 	 	to	every	potential	 illumi 	 nation 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	would	then	combine	two	 bas 	 ic 	 	 functional 	 ities 	 	:	 illumi 	 nation 	 	and	 wire 	 less 	 	data	 trans 	 mission 	 	.
and	it	's	 th 	 is 	 	 sym 	 bio 	 sis 	 	that	i	 personal 	 ly 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	could	solve	the	four	essential	 problem 	 s 	 	that	face	us	in	 wire 	 less 	 	communication	these	 day 	 s 	 	.
and	in	the	future	,	you	would	not	 on 	 ly 	 	have	14	billion	light	 bulb 	 s 	 	,	you	may	have	14	billion	li	-	fis	 deploy 	 ed 	 	 world 	 wide 	 	--	for	a	 clean 	 er 	 	,	a	 green 	 er 	 	,	and	even	a	 bright 	 er 	 	future	.
thank	you	.
