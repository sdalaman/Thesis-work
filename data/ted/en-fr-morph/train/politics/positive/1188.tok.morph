so	here	's	the	thing	.	we	have	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	where	private	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	are	 app 	 ly 	 ing 	 	 censor 	 ship 	 	 standard 	 s 	 	that	are	often	 quit 	 e 	 	 arbitr 	 ary 	 	and	 general 	 ly 	 	more	narrow	than	the	free	speech	 constit 	 ution 	 al 	 	 standard 	 s 	 	that	we	have	in	 demo 	 cracies 	 	.

so	here	's	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
in	a	pre	-	 inter 	 net 	 	world	,	 sovereign 	 ty 	 	over	our	physical	 free 	 dom 	 s 	 	,	or	lack	 there 	 of 	 	,	was	controlled	 al 	 most 	 	 entire 	 ly 	 	by	nation	-	 state 	 s 	 	.

and	 the 	 ir 	 	 sovereign 	 ties 	 	,	cross	-	cutting	,	 global 	 ly 	 	 inter 	 linked 	 	,	can	in	some	ways	 challeng 	 e 	 	the	 sovereign 	 ties 	 	of	nation	-	 state 	 s 	 	in	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	ways	,	but	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	act	to	project	and	extend	it	at	a	time	when	control	over	what	people	can	and	can	not	do	with	information	 ha 	 s 	 	more	effect	than	ever	on	the	 exercis 	 e 	 	of	power	in	our	physical	world	.
after	all	,	even	the	 lead 	 er 	 	of	the	free	world	 need 	 s 	 	a	little	help	from	the	sultan	of	facebookistan	if	he	 want 	 s 	 	to	get	 re 	 elect 	 ed 	 	next	year	.
and	these	 platform 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 certain 	 ly 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 help 	 ful 	 	to	 activist 	 s 	 	in	tunisia	and	egypt	 th 	 is 	 	past	spring	and	beyond	.

on	the	left	there	's	a	photo	taken	by	an	egyptian	activist	who	was	part	of	the	 storm 	 ing 	 	of	the	egyptian	state	security	 off 	 ice 	 s 	 	in	march	.

and	egyptian	 activist 	 s 	 	are	 assum 	 ing 	 	that	these	 techno 	 logies 	 	for	 sur 	 veil 	 lance 	 	are	still	 be 	 ing 	 	used	by	the	 transit 	 ional 	 	 author 	 ities 	 	running	the	 network 	 s 	 	there	.

but	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	lot	of	debate	in	tunisia	about	how	to	handle	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	problem	.
in	fact	,	on	twitter	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	a	number	of	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	 support 	 ive 	 	of	the	revolution	who	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	we	do	want	 demo 	 cracy 	 	and	free	 express 	 ion 	 	,	but	there	is	some	 kind 	 s 	 	of	speech	that	need	to	be	off	-	 bound 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	too	violent	and	it	might	be	 de 	 stabil 	 izing 	 	for	our	 demo 	 cracy 	 	.
but	the	problem	is	,	how	do	you	decide	who	is	in	power	to	make	these	 decision 	 s 	 	and	how	do	you	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	they	do	not	abuse	 the 	 ir 	 	power	?
 a 	 s 	 	riadh	guerfali	,	the	veteran	digital	activist	from	tunisia	,	 remark 	 ed 	 	over	 th 	 is 	 	incident	,	``	before	,	 thing 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	simple	:	you	had	the	good	 guy 	 s 	 	on	one	side	and	the	bad	 guy 	 s 	 	on	the	other	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	are	a	lot	more	subtle	.	``	welcome	to	 demo 	 cracy 	 	,	our	tunisian	and	egyptian	 friend 	 s 	 	.
the	 re 	 ality 	 	is	that	even	in	 democrat 	 ic 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	we	do	not	have	good	 answer 	 s 	 	for	how	you	balance	the	need	for	security	and	law	 enforce 	 ment 	 	on	one	hand	and	 protect 	 ion 	 	of	civil	 liber 	 ties 	 	and	free	speech	on	the	other	in	our	digital	 network 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	 what 	 ever 	 	you	may	think	of	julian	assange	,	even	people	who	are	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	big	 fan 	 s 	 	of	his	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	the	way	in	which	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	government	and	some	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	have	 handle 	 d 	 	wikileaks	.

so	we	 assum 	 e 	 	that	the	 inter 	 net 	 	is	a	border	-	 bust 	 ing 	 	technology	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	map	of	social	 network 	 s 	 	 world 	 wide 	 	,	and	 certain 	 ly 	 	facebook	 ha 	 s 	 	 conquer 	 ed 	 	much	of	the	world	--	which	is	either	a	good	or	a	bad	thing	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	how	you	like	the	way	facebook	 manage 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	service	.
but	 border 	 s 	 	do	persist	in	some	 part 	 s 	 	of	 cyber 	 space 	 	.
in	brazil	and	japan	,	it	's	for	 un 	 ique 	 	cultural	and	 linguist 	 ic 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	.
but	if	you	look	at	 chin 	 a 	 	,	vietnam	and	a	number	of	the	 form 	 er 	 	soviet	 state 	 s 	 	,	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	there	is	more	 trou 	 bling 	 	.
you	have	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	where	the	relationship	between	government	and	local	social	 network 	 ing 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	is	creating	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	where	,	 effective 	 ly 	 	,	the	 empower 	 ing 	 	potential	of	these	 platform 	 s 	 	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 con 	 s 	 trained 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	these	 relationship 	 s 	 	between	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	and	government	.
now	in	 chin 	 a 	 	,	you	have	the	``	great	 fire 	 wall 	 	,	``	 a 	 s 	 	it	's	well	-	known	,	that	 block 	 s 	 	facebook	and	twitter	and	now	google	+	and	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	other	 over 	 sea 	 s 	 	 web 	 s 	 ites 	 	.
and	that	's	 d 	 one 	 	in	part	with	the	help	from	western	technology	.
but	that	's	 on 	 ly 	 	half	of	the	story	.
the	other	part	of	the	story	are	 requir 	 ement 	 s 	 	that	the	chinese	government	 place 	 s 	 	on	all	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	 oper 	 ating 	 	on	the	chinese	 inter 	 net 	 	,	known	 a 	 s 	 	a	system	of	self	-	discipline	.
in	plain	english	,	that	 mean 	 s 	 	 censor 	 ship 	 	and	 sur 	 veil 	 lance 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 user 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ce 	 re 	 mon 	 y 	 	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	 attend 	 ed 	 	in	2009	where	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	of	 chin 	 a 	 	 present 	 ed 	 	 a 	 ward 	 s 	 	to	the	top	20	chinese	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	that	are	best	at	 exercis 	 ing 	 	self	-	discipline	--	i.e	.	 pol 	 ic 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	content	.
and	 rob 	 in 	 	li	,	ceo	of	baidu	,	 chin 	 a 	 	's	 domin 	 ant 	 	search	engine	,	was	one	of	the	 recipient 	 s 	 	.
in	russia	,	they	do	not	 general 	 ly 	 	block	the	 inter 	 net 	 	and	 direct 	 ly 	 	censor	 web 	 s 	 ites 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	rospil	that	's	an	anti	-	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
and	 ear 	 lier 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	,	there	was	a	 trou 	 bling 	 	incident	where	people	who	had	made	 don 	 ations 	 	to	rospil	through	a	 payment 	 s 	 	 process 	 ing 	 	system	 call 	 ed 	 	yandex	money	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 receiv 	 ed 	 	 threaten 	 ing 	 	phone	 call 	 s 	 	from	 member 	 s 	 	of	a	 national 	 ist 	 	party	who	had	 obtain 	 ed 	 	 detail 	 s 	 	about	 donor 	 s 	 	to	rospil	through	 member 	 s 	 	of	the	security	 service 	 s 	 	who	had	 some 	 how 	 	 obtain 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	information	from	people	at	yandex	money	.
 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 chill 	 ing 	 	effect	on	people	's	ability	to	use	the	 inter 	 net 	 	to	hold	government	 account 	 able 	 	.
so	we	have	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	in	the	world	 to 	 day 	 	where	in	more	and	more	 count 	 ries 	 	the	relationship	between	 citizen 	 s 	 	and	 government 	 s 	 	is	 mediate 	 d 	 	through	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	which	is	 com 	 prise 	 d 	 	 prim 	 arily 	 	of	 private 	 ly 	 	owned	and	 oper 	 ated 	 	 service 	 s 	 	.
so	the	 import 	 ant 	 	question	,	i	think	,	is	not	 th 	 is 	 	debate	over	 whet 	 her 	 	the	 inter 	 net 	 	is	going	to	help	the	good	 guy 	 s 	 	more	than	the	bad	 guy 	 s 	 	.
of	course	,	it	's	going	to	empower	 who 	 ever 	 	is	most	 skill 	 ed 	 	at	using	the	technology	and	best	 understand 	 s 	 	the	 inter 	 net 	 	in	 compar 	 ison 	 	with	 who 	 ever 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 advers 	 ary 	 	is	.
the	most	 urge 	 nt 	 	question	we	need	to	be	 ask 	 ing 	 	 to 	 day 	 	is	how	do	we	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 evolve 	 s 	 	in	a	citizen	-	centric	manner	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	all	of	you	will	agree	that	the	 on 	 ly 	 	legitimate	purpose	of	government	is	to	serve	 citizen 	 s 	 	,
and	i	would	 argu 	 e 	 	that	the	 on 	 ly 	 	legitimate	purpose	of	technology	is	to	improve	our	 live 	 s 	 	,	not	to	 manipul 	 ate 	 	or	enslave	us	.
so	the	question	is	,	we	know	how	to	hold	government	 account 	 able 	 	.
we	do	n't	 necess 	 arily 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	do	it	 ver 	 y 	 	well	,	but	we	have	a	sense	of	what	the	 model 	 s 	 	are	,	 politic 	 ally 	 	and	 institution 	 ally 	 	,	to	do	that	.
how	do	you	hold	the	 sovereign 	 s 	 	of	 cyber 	 space 	 	 account 	 able 	 	to	the	public	interest	when	most	ceo	's	 argu 	 e 	 	that	 the 	 ir 	 	main	 oblig 	 ation 	 	is	to	 maxim 	 ize 	 	 share 	 holder 	 	profit	?
and	government	 regulat 	 ion 	 	often	is	n't	 help 	 ing 	 	all	that	much	.
you	have	 situ 	 ations 	 	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	in	france	where	 p 	 resident 	 	sarkozy	 tell 	 s 	 	the	ceo	's	of	 inter 	 net 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	,	``	we	're	the	 on 	 ly 	 	legitimate	 represent 	 ative 	 s 	 	of	the	public	interest	.	``	but	then	he	 go 	 es 	 	and	 champion 	 s 	 	 law 	 s 	 	like	the	 in 	 famous 	 	``	three	-	 strike 	 s 	 	``	law	that	would	 dis 	 connect 	 	 citizen 	 s 	 	from	the	 inter 	 net 	 	for	file	sharing	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 condemn 	 ed 	 	by	the	u.n.	special	rapporteur	on	 free 	 dom 	 	of	 express 	 ion 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 dis 	 proportion 	 ate 	 	 viol 	 ation 	 	of	 citizen 	 s 	 	'	right	to	 communication 	 s 	 	,	and	 ha 	 s 	 	raised	 question 	 s 	 	 among 	 st 	 	civil	 socie 	 ty 	 	 group 	 s 	 	about	 whet 	 her 	 	some	 politic 	 al 	 	 represent 	 ative 	 s 	 	are	more	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 pre 	 serv 	 ing 	 	the	 interest 	 s 	 	of	the	 entertain 	 ment 	 	industry	than	they	are	in	 defend 	 ing 	 	the	 right 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 citizen 	 s 	 	.
and	here	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 king 	 dom 	 	there	's	 al 	 so 	 	concern	over	a	law	 call 	 ed 	 	the	digital	 eco 	 nomy 	 	act	that	's	placing	more	 on 	 us 	 	on	private	 inter 	 media 	 ries 	 	to	police	citizen	behavior	.
so	what	we	need	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	is	that	if	we	want	to	have	a	citizen	-	centric	 inter 	 net 	 	in	the	future	,	we	need	a	 broad 	 er 	 	and	more	 sustain 	 ed 	 	 inter 	 net 	 	 free 	 dom 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	.
after	all	,	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	did	n't	stop	polluting	 ground 	 water 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	matter	of	course	,	or	 employ 	 ing 	 	10	-	year	-	olds	 a 	 s 	 	a	matter	of	course	,	just	 be 	 cause 	 	 ex 	 ecutive 	 s 	 	 wok 	 e 	 	up	one	day	and	 decide 	 d 	 	it	was	the	right	thing	to	do	.
it	was	the	result	of	 decade 	 s 	 	of	 sustain 	 ed 	 	 activ 	 ism 	 	,	 share 	 holder 	 	 advoc 	 acy 	 	and	consumer	 advoc 	 acy 	 	.
 similar 	 ly 	 	,	 government 	 s 	 	do	n't	enact	intelligent	 environment 	 al 	 	and	labor	 law 	 s 	 	just	 be 	 cause 	 	 politic 	 ians 	 	wake	up	one	day	.
it	's	the	result	of	 ver 	 y 	 	 sustain 	 ed 	 	and	 pro 	 long 	 ed 	 	 politic 	 al 	 	 activ 	 ism 	 
that	you	get	the	right	 regulat 	 ions 	 	,	and	that	you	get	the	right	corporate	behavior	.
we	need	to	make	the	same	approach	with	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	are	going	to	need	 politic 	 al 	 	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
eight	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 approximate 	 ly 	 	,	the	 bar 	 on 	 s 	 	of	england	 decide 	 d 	 	that	the	divine	right	of	 king 	 s 	 	was	no	 long 	 er 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	for	them	so	well	,	and	they	 force 	 d 	 	king	john	to	sign	the	 magn 	 a 	 	 cart 	 a 	 	,	which	 recogn 	 ized 	 	that	even	the	king	who	 claim 	 ed 	 	to	have	divine	rule	still	had	to	 ab 	 ide 	 	by	a	 bas 	 ic 	 	set	of	 rule 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	set	off	a	cycle	of	what	we	can	call	 politic 	 al 	 	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	which	led	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	to	the	idea	of	consent	of	the	 govern 	 ed 	 	--	which	was	 implement 	 ed 	 	for	the	first	time	by	that	radical	 revolution 	 ary 	 	government	in	america	 a 	 cross 	 	the	pond	.
so	now	we	need	to	figure	out	how	to	build	consent	of	the	 network 	 ed 	 	.
