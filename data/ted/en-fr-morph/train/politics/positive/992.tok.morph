i	'm	going	to	talk	to	you	about	power	in	 th 	 is 	 	21st	century	.
and	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	what	i	'd	like	to	tell	you	is	that	power	is	changing	,	and	there	are	two	 type 	 s 	 	of	 change 	 s 	 	i	want	to	discuss	.
one	is	power	 transit 	 ion 	 	,	which	is	change	of	power	 among 	 st 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
and	there	the	simple	version	of	the	 mess 	 age 	 	is	it	's	moving	from	west	to	east	.
the	other	is	power	diffusion	,	the	way	power	is	moving	from	all	 state 	 s 	 	west	or	east	to	non	-	state	 act 	 ors 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	two	 thing 	 s 	 	are	the	huge	 shift 	 s 	 	of	power	in	our	century	.
and	i	want	to	tell	you	about	them	each	 separat 	 e 	 ly 	 	and	then	how	they	interact	and	why	,	in	the	end	,	there	may	be	some	good	news	.
when	we	talk	about	power	 transit 	 ion 	 	,	we	often	talk	about	the	rise	of	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	.
it	 re 	 ally 	 	should	be	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	or	return	of	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	.
if	we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	world	in	1800	,	you	'd	find	that	more	than	half	of	the	world	's	people	lived	in	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	and	they	made	more	than	half	the	world	's	product	.
now	fast	forward	to	1900	:	half	the	world	's	people	--	more	than	half	--	still	live	in	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	,	but	they	're	now	making	 on 	 ly 	 	a	fifth	of	the	world	's	product	.
what	 happen 	 ed 	 	?	the	industrial	revolution	,	which	 me 	 ant 	 	that	all	of	a	sudden	,	europe	and	america	 be 	 came 	 	the	 domin 	 ant 	 	center	of	the	world	.
what	we	're	going	to	see	in	the	21st	century	is	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	 gradu 	 ally 	 	 return 	 ing 	 	to	 be 	 ing 	 	more	than	half	of	the	world	's	population	and	more	than	half	of	the	world	's	product	.
that	's	 import 	 ant 	 	and	it	's	an	 import 	 ant 	 	shift	.
but	let	me	tell	you	a	little	bit	about	the	other	shift	that	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	,	which	is	power	diffusion	.
to	understand	power	diffusion	put	 th 	 is 	 	in	your	mind	:	computing	and	 communication 	 s 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	have	 fall 	 en 	 	a	 thousand 	 fold 	 	between	1970	and	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	century	.
now	that	's	a	big	abstract	number	.	but	to	make	it	more	real	,	if	the	price	of	an	 auto 	 mobile 	 	had	 fall 	 en 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	price	of	computing	power	,	you	could	buy	a	car	 to 	 day 	 	for	five	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
now	when	the	price	of	any	technology	 decline 	 s 	 	that	 dramat 	 ically 	 	,	the	 bar 	 rier 	 s 	 	to	entry	go	down	.	 any 	 body 	 	can	play	in	the	game	.
so	in	1970	,	if	you	 want 	 ed 	 	to	communicate	from	oxford	to	johannesburg	to	new	delhi	to	brasilia	and	 any 	 where 	 	 simultaneous 	 ly 	 	,	you	could	do	it	.	the	technology	was	there	.
but	to	be	able	to	do	it	,	you	had	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	rich	--	a	government	,	a	 multi 	 national 	 	corporation	,	 may 	 be 	 	the	catholic	church	--	but	you	had	to	be	 pre 	 tty 	 	 wealth 	 y 	 	.
now	,	 any 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	that	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	,	which	 previous 	 ly 	 	was	 restrict 	 ed 	 	by	price	just	to	a	few	 act 	 ors 	 	.	if	they	have	the	price	of	entry	 in 	 to 	 	an	 inter 	 net 	 	cafe	--	the	last	time	i	 look 	 ed 	 	,	it	was	 some 	 thing 	 	like	a	pound	an	hour	--	and	if	you	have	skype	,	it	's	free	.
so	 cap 	 abilities 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	once	 restrict 	 ed 	 	are	now	 avail 	 able 	 	to	 every 	 one 	 	.
and	what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	is	not	that	the	age	of	the	state	is	over	.
the	state	still	 matter 	 s 	 	.
but	the	stage	is	 crowd 	 ed 	 	.
the	state	's	not	 al 	 one 	 	.	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 act 	 ors 	 	.
some	of	that	's	good	:
oxfam	,	a	great	non	-	 government 	 al 	 	 a 	 ctor 	 	.
some	of	it	's	bad	:
al	qaeda	,	 an 	 other 	 	non	-	 government 	 al 	 	 a 	 ctor 	 	.
but	think	of	what	it	 do 	 es 	 	to	how	we	think	in	 tradition 	 al 	 	 term 	 s 	 	and	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	.
we	think	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	war	and	 inter 	 state 	 	war	.
and	you	can	think	back	to	1941	when	the	government	of	japan	 attack 	 ed 	 	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	at	pearl	harbor	.
it	's	worth	 not 	 ic 	 ing 	 	that	a	non	-	state	 a 	 ctor 	 	 attack 	 ing 	 	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	in	2001	 kill 	 ed 	 	more	americans	than	the	government	of	japan	did	in	1941	.
you	might	think	of	that	 a 	 s 	 	the	 privat 	 ization 	 	of	war	.
so	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	a	great	change	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	diffusion	of	power	.
now	the	problem	is	that	we	're	not	 think 	 ing 	 	about	it	in	 ver 	 y 	 	 innov 	 ative 	 	ways	.
so	let	me	step	back	and	ask	:	what	's	power	?
power	is	simple	the	ability	to	affect	 other 	 s 	 	to	get	the	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	you	want	,	and	you	can	do	it	in	three	ways	.
you	can	do	it	with	 threat 	 s 	 	of	 coerc 	 ion 	 	,	``	 stick 	 s 	 	,	``	you	can	do	it	with	 payment 	 s 	 	,	``	 carrot 	 s 	 	,	``	or	you	can	do	it	by	 get 	 ting 	 	 other 	 s 	 	to	want	what	you	want	.
and	that	ability	to	get	 other 	 s 	 	to	want	what	you	want	,	to	get	the	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	you	want	 with 	 out 	 	 coerc 	 ion 	 	or	payment	,	is	what	i	call	soft	power	.
and	that	soft	power	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	much	 neglect 	 ed 	 	and	much	 mis 	 under 	 stood 	 	,
and	yet	it	's	 tremendous 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	if	you	can	learn	to	use	more	soft	power	,	you	can	 s 	 ave 	 	a	lot	on	 carrot 	 s 	 	and	 stick 	 s 	 	.
 tradition 	 ally 	 	,	the	way	people	thought	about	power	was	 prim 	 arily 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 militar 	 y 	 	power	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	the	great	oxford	historian	who	taught	here	at	 th 	 is 	 	university	,	a.j.p	.	taylor	,	defined	a	great	power	 a 	 s 	 	a	country	able	to	prevail	in	war	.
but	we	need	a	new	narrative	if	we	're	to	understand	power	in	the	21st	century	.
it	's	not	just	 prevail 	 ing 	 	at	war	,	 th 	 ough 	 	war	still	 persist 	 s 	 	.
it	's	not	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 arm 	 y 	 	 win 	 s 	 	;	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	story	 win 	 s 	 	.
and	we	have	to	think	much	more	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 narrative 	 s 	 	and	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	narrative	is	going	to	be	effective	.
now	let	me	go	back	to	the	question	of	power	 transit 	 ion 	 	between	 state 	 s 	 	and	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	there	.
the	 narrative 	 s 	 	that	we	use	now	tend	to	be	the	rise	and	fall	of	the	great	 power 	 s 	 	.
and	the	current	narrative	is	all	about	the	rise	of	 chin 	 a 	 	and	the	decline	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	with	the	2008	financial	crisis	,	 man 	 y 	 	people	 s 	 aid 	 	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	end	of	american	power	.
the	tectonic	 plate 	 s 	 	of	world	 politic 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	shifting	.
and	 p 	 resident 	 	medvedev	of	russia	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 pronounce 	 d 	 	in	2008	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	end	of	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	power	.
but	in	fact	,	 th 	 is 	 	metaphor	of	decline	is	often	 ver 	 y 	 	 mis 	 lead 	 ing 	 	.
if	you	look	at	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	in	 re 	 cent 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	you	'll	see	the	 cycle 	 s 	 	of	belief	in	american	decline	come	and	go	every	10	or	15	 year 	 s 	 	or	so	.
in	1958	,	after	the	soviets	put	up	sputnik	,	it	was	``	that	's	the	end	of	america	.	``
in	1973	,	with	the	oil	 em 	 bar 	 go 	 	and	the	 clo 	 s 	 ing 	 	of	the	gold	window	,	that	was	the	end	of	america	.
in	the	1980s	,	 a 	 s 	 	america	went	through	a	 transit 	 ion 	 	in	the	reagan	period	,	between	the	rust	belt	 eco 	 nomy 	 	of	the	 mid 	 west 	 	to	the	silicon	 val 	 ley 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	of	california	,	that	was	the	end	of	america	.
but	in	fact	,	what	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	is	 non 	 e 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 we 	 re 	 	true	.
 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	people	 we 	 re 	 	over	-	 enthusiast 	 ic 	 	in	the	early	2000s	,	 think 	 ing 	 	america	could	do	 any 	 thing 	 	,	which	led	us	 in 	 to 	 	some	 dis 	 astro 	 us 	 	foreign	policy	 adventure 	 s 	 	,	and	now	we	're	back	to	decline	 aga 	 in 	 	.
the	moral	of	 th 	 is 	 	story	is	all	these	 narrative 	 s 	 	about	rise	and	fall	and	decline	tell	us	a	lot	more	about	 psycho 	 logy 	 	than	they	do	about	 re 	 ality 	 	.
if	we	try	to	focus	on	the	 re 	 ality 	 	,	then	what	we	need	to	focus	on	is	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 chin 	 a 	 	and	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
goldman	sachs	 ha 	 s 	 	 project 	 ed 	 	that	 chin 	 a 	 	,	the	chinese	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	will	surpass	that	of	the	u.s.	by	2027	.
so	we	've	got	,	what	,	17	more	 year 	 s 	 	to	go	or	so	before	 chin 	 a 	 	's	 big 	 ger 	 	.
now	 some 	 day 	 	,	with	a	billion	point	three	people	 get 	 ting 	 	 rich 	 er 	 	,	they	are	going	to	be	 big 	 ger 	 	than	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
but	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 care 	 ful 	 	about	these	 project 	 ions 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	goldman	sachs	 project 	 ion 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	that	 give 	 s 	 	you	an	accurate	picture	of	power	 transit 	 ion 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	century	.
let	me	 ment 	 ion 	 	three	 reason 	 s 	 	why	it	's	too	simple	.
first	of	all	,	it	's	a	linear	 project 	 ion 	 	.
you	know	,	 every 	 thing 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	here	's	the	growth	rate	of	 chin 	 a 	 	,	here	's	the	growth	rate	of	the	u.s.	,	here	it	 go 	 es 	 	--	straight	line	.
 histo 	 ry 	 	is	not	linear	.
there	are	often	 bump 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	the	road	,	 accident 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	the	way	.
the	second	thing	is	that	the	chinese	 eco 	 nomy 	 	 pass 	 es 	 	the	u.s.	 eco 	 nomy 	 	in	,	let	's	say	,	2030	,	which	it	may	it	,	that	will	be	a	measure	of	total	economic	 s 	 ize 	 	,	but	not	of	per	capita	income	--	wo	n't	tell	you	about	the	 com 	 position 	 	of	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
 chin 	 a 	 	still	 ha 	 s 	 	large	 area 	 s 	 	of	 under 	 develop 	 ment 	 
and	per	capita	income	is	a	better	measure	of	the	 sophistic 	 ation 	 	of	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
and	that	the	chinese	wo	n't	catch	up	or	pass	the	americans	 un 	 til 	 	 some 	 where 	 	in	the	 lat 	 ter 	 	part	,	after	2050	,	of	 th 	 is 	 	century	.
the	other	point	that	's	worth	 not 	 ic 	 ing 	 	is	how	one	-	dimensional	 th 	 is 	 	 project 	 ion 	 	is	.
you	know	,	it	 look 	 s 	 	at	economic	power	 measur 	 ed 	 	by	gdp	.
 do 	 es 	 	n't	tell	you	much	about	 militar 	 y 	 	power	,	 do 	 es 	 	n't	tell	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	about	soft	power	.
it	's	all	 ver 	 y 	 	one	-	dimensional	.	and	 al 	 so 	 	,	when	we	think	about	the	rise	of	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	,	or	return	of	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	 a 	 s 	 	i	 call 	 ed 	 	it	a	little	bit	 ear 	 lier 	 	,	it	's	worth	 remember 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	's	not	one	thing	.
if	you	're	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	japan	,	or	in	new	delhi	,	or	in	hanoi	,	your	view	of	the	rise	of	 chin 	 a 	 	is	a	little	different	than	if	you	're	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	beijing	.
 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	one	of	the	 advantage 	 s 	 	that	the	americans	will	have	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	power	in	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	is	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	want	an	american	 insur 	 ance 	 	policy	against	the	rise	of	 chin 	 a 	 	.
it	's	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	mexico	and	canada	 we 	 re 	 	 hostil 	 e 	 	 neighbor 	 s 	 	to	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	which	they	're	not	.
so	these	simple	 project 	 ions 	 	of	the	goldman	sachs	type	are	not	 tell 	 ing 	 	us	what	we	need	to	know	about	power	 transit 	 ion 	 	.
but	you	might	ask	,	well	so	what	in	any	case	?
why	 do 	 es 	 	it	matter	?	who	 care 	 s 	 	?
is	 th 	 is 	 	just	a	game	that	 diplomat 	 s 	 	and	 academic 	 s 	 	play	?
the	answer	is	it	 matter 	 s 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	a	lot	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	if	you	 believ 	 e 	 	in	decline	and	you	get	the	 answer 	 s 	 	wrong	on	 th 	 is 	 	,	the	 fact 	 s 	 	,	not	the	 myth 	 s 	 	,	you	may	have	 poli 	 cies 	 	which	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
let	me	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	from	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
the	peloponnesian	war	was	the	great	conflict	in	which	the	greek	city	state	system	 to 	 re 	 	 it 	 self 	 	 a 	 part 	 	two	and	a	half	millennia	ago	.
what	 caus 	 ed 	 	it	?
thucydides	,	the	great	historian	of	the	the	peloponnesian	war	,	 s 	 aid 	 	it	was	the	rise	in	the	power	of	athens	and	the	fear	it	 create 	 d 	 	in	sparta	.
notice	both	 halv 	 es 	 	of	that	 explan 	 ation 	 	.
 man 	 y 	 	people	 argu 	 e 	 	that	the	21st	century	is	going	to	repeat	the	20th	century	,	in	which	world	war	one	,	the	great	 con 	 flag 	 ration 	 	in	which	the	european	state	system	 to 	 re 	 	 it 	 self 	 	 a 	 part 	 	and	 destroy 	 ed 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 central 	 ity 	 	in	the	world	,	that	that	was	 caus 	 ed 	 	by	the	rise	in	the	power	of	germany	and	the	fear	it	 create 	 d 	 	in	britain	.
so	there	are	people	who	are	 tell 	 ing 	 	us	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	be	 re 	 produce 	 d 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	that	what	we	're	going	to	see	is	the	same	thing	now	in	 th 	 is 	 	century	.
no	,	i	think	that	's	wrong	.
it	's	bad	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
for	one	thing	,	germany	had	 surpass 	 ed 	 	britain	in	industrial	strength	by	1900	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	,	 chin 	 a 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 pass 	 ed 	 	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
but	 al 	 so 	 	,	if	you	have	 th 	 is 	 	belief	and	it	 create 	 s 	 	a	sense	of	fear	,	it	 lead 	 s 	 	to	 over 	 re 	 action 	 	.
and	the	 great 	 est 	 	danger	we	have	of	 man 	 aging 	 	 th 	 is 	 	power	 transit 	 ion 	 	of	the	shift	 to 	 ward 	 	the	east	is	fear	.
to	 para 	 phrase 	 	franklin	roosevelt	from	a	different	 con 	 text 	 	,	the	 great 	 est 	 	thing	we	have	to	fear	is	fear	 it 	 self 	 	.
we	do	n't	have	to	fear	the	rise	of	 chin 	 a 	 	or	the	return	of	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	.
and	if	we	have	 poli 	 cies 	 	in	which	we	take	it	in	that	 large 	 r 	 	 historic 	 al 	 	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	we	're	going	to	be	able	to	manage	 th 	 is 	 	process	.
let	me	say	a	word	now	about	the	 distribut 	 ion 	 	of	power	and	how	it	 relat 	 es 	 	to	power	diffusion	and	then	pull	these	two	 type 	 s 	 	together	.
if	you	ask	how	is	power	 distribut 	 ed 	 	in	the	world	 to 	 day 	 	,	it	's	 distribut 	 ed 	 	much	like	a	three	-	dimensional	 ches 	 s 	 	game	.
top	board	:	 militar 	 y 	 	power	among	 state 	 s 	 	.
the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 super 	 power 	 	,	and	it	's	 like 	 ly 	 	to	remain	that	way	for	two	or	three	 decade 	 s 	 	.
 chin 	 a 	 	's	not	going	to	replace	the	u.s.	on	 th 	 is 	 	 militar 	 y 	 	board	.
middle	board	of	 th 	 is 	 	three	-	dimensional	 ches 	 s 	 	game	:	economic	power	among	 state 	 s 	 	.
power	is	multi	-	polar	.
there	are	 balanc 	 ers 	 	--
the	u.s.	,	europe	,	 chin 	 a 	 	,	japan	can	balance	each	other	.
the	bottom	board	of	 th 	 is 	 	three	-	dimensional	,	the	board	of	 trans 	 national 	 	 relation 	 s 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	that	cross	 border 	 s 	 	 out 	 side 	 	the	control	of	 government 	 s 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	like	climate	change	,	drug	trade	,	financial	 flow 	 s 	 	,	 pan 	 demic 	 s 	 	,	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	that	cross	 border 	 s 	 	 out 	 side 	 	the	control	of	 government 	 s 	 	,	there	 no 	 body 	 	's	in	charge	.
it	 make 	 s 	 	no	sense	to	call	 th 	 is 	 	 uni 	 polar 	 	or	multi	-	polar	.
power	is	 chaotic 	 ally 	 	 distribut 	 ed 	 	.
and	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	you	can	solve	these	 problem 	 s 	 	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	 man 	 y 	 	 great 	 est 	 	 challeng 	 es 	 	are	coming	in	 th 	 is 	 	century	--	is	through	 co 	 operation 	 	,	through	 work 	 ing 	 	together	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	that	soft	power	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	more	 import 	 ant 	 	,	that	ability	to	organize	 network 	 s 	 	to	deal	with	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 problem 	 s 	 	and	to	be	able	to	get	 co 	 operation 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	way	of	 put 	 ting 	 	it	is	that	 a 	 s 	 	we	think	of	power	in	the	21st	century	,	we	want	to	get	away	from	the	idea	that	power	's	 al 	 ways 	 	zero	sum	--	my	gain	is	your	loss	and	vice	versa	.
power	can	 al 	 so 	 	be	positive	sum	,	where	your	gain	can	be	my	gain	.
if	 chin 	 a 	 	 develop 	 s 	 	 great 	 er 	 	energy	security	and	 great 	 er 	 	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	deal	with	 it 	 s 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	of	carbon	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	,	that	's	good	for	us	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	good	for	 chin 	 a 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	good	for	 every 	 body 	 	else	.
so	 empower 	 ing 	 	 chin 	 a 	 	to	deal	with	 it 	 s 	 	own	 problem 	 s 	 	of	carbon	is	good	for	 every 	 body 	 	,	and	it	's	not	a	zero	sum	,	i	win	,	you	lose	.
it	's	one	in	which	we	can	all	gain	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	we	think	about	power	in	 th 	 is 	 	century	,	we	want	to	get	away	from	 th 	 is 	 	view	that	it	's	all	i	win	,	you	lose	.
now	i	do	n't	mean	to	be	pollyannaish	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
 war 	 s 	 	persist	.	power	 persist 	 s 	 	.
 militar 	 y 	 	power	is	 import 	 ant 	 	.
 keep 	 ing 	 	 balance 	 s 	 	is	 import 	 ant 	 	.
all	 th 	 is 	 	still	 persist 	 s 	 	.
hard	power	is	there	,	and	it	will	remain	.
but	 un 	 less 	 	you	learn	how	to	mix	hard	power	with	soft	power	 in 	 to 	 	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	that	i	call	smart	power	,	you	're	not	going	to	deal	with	the	new	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 problem 	 s 	 	that	we	're	facing	.
so	the	key	question	that	we	need	to	think	about	 a 	 s 	 	we	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	do	we	work	together	to	produce	global	public	 good 	 s 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	from	which	all	of	us	can	benefit	?
how	do	we	define	our	national	 interest 	 s 	 	so	that	it	's	not	just	zero	sum	,	but	positive	sum	.
in	that	sense	,	if	we	define	our	 interest 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	for	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	the	way	britain	defined	 it 	 s 	 	 interest 	 s 	 	in	the	19th	century	,	 keep 	 ing 	 	an	open	 tra 	 d 	 ing 	 	system	,	 keep 	 ing 	 	a	 mon 	 et 	 ary 	 	 st 	 ability 	 	,	 keep 	 ing 	 	 free 	 dom 	 	of	the	 sea 	 s 	 	--	 t 	 hose 	 	 we 	 re 	 	good	for	britain	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	good	for	 other 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
and	in	the	21st	century	,	you	have	to	do	an	analog	to	that	.
how	do	we	produce	global	public	 good 	 s 	 	,	which	are	good	for	us	,	but	good	for	 every 	 one 	 	at	the	same	time	?
and	that	's	going	to	be	the	good	news	dimension	of	what	we	need	to	think	about	 a 	 s 	 	we	think	of	power	in	the	21st	century	.
there	are	ways	to	define	our	 interest 	 s 	 	in	which	,	while	 protect 	 ing 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	with	hard	power	,	we	can	organize	with	 other 	 s 	 	in	 network 	 s 	 	to	produce	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	public	 good 	 s 	 	,	but	ways	that	will	enhance	our	soft	power	.
so	if	one	 look 	 s 	 	at	the	 state 	 ments 	 	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	made	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	am	 impress 	 ed 	 	that	when	hillary	clinton	 de 	 scribed 	 	the	foreign	policy	of	the	obama	 administr 	 ation 	 	,	she	 s 	 aid 	 	that	the	foreign	policy	of	the	obama	 administr 	 ation 	 	was	going	to	be	smart	power	,	 a 	 s 	 	she	put	it	,	``	using	all	the	 tool 	 s 	 	in	our	foreign	policy	tool	box	.	``	and	if	we	're	going	to	deal	with	these	two	great	power	 shift 	 s 	 	that	i	've	 de 	 scribed 	 	,	the	power	shift	 represent 	 ed 	 	by	 transit 	 ion 	 	among	 state 	 s 	 	,	the	power	shift	 represent 	 ed 	 	by	diffusion	of	power	away	from	all	 state 	 s 	 	,	we	're	going	to	have	to	develop	a	new	narrative	of	power	in	which	we	combine	hard	and	soft	power	 in 	 to 	 	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	of	smart	power	.
and	that	's	the	good	news	i	have	.	we	can	do	that	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
