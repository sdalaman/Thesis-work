in	his	 inaugu 	 ral 	 	address	,	barack	obama	 appeal 	 ed 	 	to	each	of	us	to	give	our	best	 a 	 s 	 	we	try	to	 extr 	 ic 	 ate 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	current	financial	crisis	.
but	what	did	he	appeal	to	?
he	did	not	,	 hap 	 pi 	 ly 	 	,	follow	in	the	 foot 	 step 	 s 	 	of	his	 pre 	 decessor 	 	,	and	tell	us	to	just	go	 shop 	 ping 	 	.
nor	did	he	tell	us	,	``	trust	us	.	trust	your	country	.
invest	,	invest	,	invest	.	``
 in 	 stead 	 	,	what	he	told	us	was	to	put	 a 	 side 	 	 child 	 ish 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	he	 appeal 	 ed 	 	to	virtue	.
virtue	is	an	old	-	 fashion 	 ed 	 	word	.	it	 seem 	 s 	 	a	little	out	of	place	in	a	cutting	-	edge	environment	like	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
and	 be 	 side 	 s 	 	,	some	of	you	might	be	 wonder 	 ing 	 	,	what	the	hell	 do 	 es 	 	it	mean	?
let	me	begin	with	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	job	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	of	a	hospital	janitor	that	is	 scroll 	 ing 	 	up	on	the	screen	.
and	all	of	the	 item 	 s 	 	on	it	are	 un 	 remark 	 able 	 	.
they	're	the	 thing 	 s 	 	you	would	expect	:	mop	the	 floor 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 weep 	 	them	,	empty	the	trash	,	 re 	 stock 	 	the	 cabinet 	 s 	 	.
it	may	be	a	little	surprising	how	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	there	are	,	but	it	's	not	surprising	what	they	are	.
but	the	one	thing	i	want	you	to	notice	about	them	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	even	 th 	 ough 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	long	list	,	there	is	n't	a	single	thing	on	it	that	 involve 	 s 	 	other	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
not	one	.
the	janitor	's	job	could	just	 a 	 s 	 	well	be	 d 	 one 	 	in	a	 mort 	 uary 	 	 a 	 s 	 	in	a	hospital	.
and	yet	,	when	some	 psycho 	 logists 	 	 interview 	 ed 	 	hospital	 janitor 	 s 	 	to	get	a	sense	of	what	they	thought	 the 	 ir 	 	 job 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	like	,	they	 en 	 counter 	 ed 	 	 mi 	 ke 	 	,	who	told	them	about	how	he	 stop 	 ped 	 	 mop 	 ping 	 	the	floor	 be 	 cause 	 	mr.	jones	was	out	of	his	bed	 get 	 ting 	 	a	little	 exercis 	 e 	 	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	build	up	his	strength	,	 walk 	 ing 	 	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	up	and	down	the	hall	.
and	charlene	told	them	about	how	she	 ignor 	 ed 	 	her	 super 	 visor 	 	's	 ad 	 mon 	 ition 	 	and	did	n't	vacuum	the	 visit 	 or 	 	's	 loung 	 e 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	there	 we 	 re 	 	some	family	 member 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	there	all	day	,	every	day	who	,	at	 th 	 is 	 	moment	,	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	be	taking	a	nap	.
and	then	there	was	luke	,	who	 wash 	 ed 	 	the	floor	in	a	 com 	 at 	 ose 	 	young	man	's	room	twice	 be 	 cause 	 	the	man	's	father	,	who	had	 be 	 en 	 	 keep 	 ing 	 	a	vigil	for	six	 month 	 s 	 	,	did	n't	see	luke	do	it	the	first	time	,	and	his	father	was	 ang 	 ry 	 	.
and	behavior	like	 th 	 is 	 	from	 janitor 	 s 	 	,	from	 technician 	 s 	 	,	from	 nurse 	 s 	 	and	,	if	we	're	 luck 	 y 	 	now	and	then	,	from	 doctor 	 s 	 	,	 do 	 es 	 	n't	just	make	people	feel	a	little	better	,	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 improve 	 s 	 	the	quality	of	patient	care	and	 en 	 able 	 s 	 	 hospital 	 s 	 	to	run	well	.
now	,	not	all	 janitor 	 s 	 	are	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	of	course	.
but	the	 one 	 s 	 	who	are	think	that	these	 sort 	 s 	 	of	human	 interact 	 ions 	 	 in 	 vol 	 v 	 ing 	 	 kind 	 ness 	 	,	care	and	 empath 	 y 	 	are	an	essential	part	of	the	job	.
and	yet	 the 	 ir 	 	job	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	 contain 	 s 	 	not	one	word	about	other	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
these	 janitor 	 s 	 	have	the	moral	will	to	do	right	by	other	people	.
and	beyond	 th 	 is 	 	,	they	have	the	moral	skill	to	figure	out	what	``	 do 	 ing 	 	right	``	 mean 	 s 	 	.
``	practical	 wis 	 dom 	 	,	``	aristotle	told	us	,	``	is	the	combination	of	moral	will	and	moral	skill	.	``
a	wise	person	 know 	 s 	 	when	and	how	to	make	the	exception	to	every	rule	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	 janitor 	 s 	 	 k 	 new 	 	when	to	 ignor 	 e 	 	the	job	 du 	 ties 	 	in	the	service	of	other	 object 	 ive 	 s 	 	.
a	wise	person	 know 	 s 	 	how	to	 improv 	 ise 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	luke	did	when	he	re	-	 wash 	 ed 	 	the	floor	.
real	-	world	 problem 	 s 	 	are	often	 ambigu 	 ous 	 	and	ill	-	defined	and	the	 con 	 text 	 	is	 al 	 ways 	 	changing	.
a	wise	person	is	like	a	jazz	 music 	 ian 	 	--	using	the	 note 	 s 	 	on	the	page	,	but	 danc 	 ing 	 	around	them	,	 invent 	 ing 	 	 combination 	 s 	 	that	are	appropriate	for	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	and	the	people	at	hand	.

to	serve	other	people	,	not	to	 manipul 	 ate 	 	other	people	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	most	 import 	 ant 	 	,	a	wise	person	is	made	,	not	born	.
 wis 	 dom 	 	 depend 	 s 	 	on	experience	,	and	not	just	any	experience	.
you	need	the	time	to	get	to	know	the	people	that	you	're	 serv 	 ing 	 	.
you	need	 per 	 mission 	 	to	be	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	 improv 	 ise 	 	,	try	new	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 occasion 	 ally 	 	to	fail	and	to	learn	from	your	 failure 	 s 	 	.
and	you	need	to	be	 mentor 	 ed 	 	by	wise	 teacher 	 s 	 	.
when	you	ask	the	 janitor 	 s 	 	who	 behav 	 ed 	 	like	the	 one 	 s 	 	i	 de 	 scribed 	 	how	hard	it	is	to	learn	to	do	 the 	 ir 	 	job	,	they	tell	you	that	it	 take 	 s 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	experience	.

at	ted	,	 brilli 	 ance 	 	is	 ramp 	 ant 	 	.
it	's	 scar 	 y 	 	.
the	good	news	is	you	do	n't	need	to	be	 brilli 	 ant 	 	to	be	wise	.
the	bad	news	is	that	 with 	 out 	 	 wis 	 dom 	 	,	 brilli 	 ance 	 	is	n't	 en 	 ough 	 	.
it	's	 a 	 s 	 	 like 	 ly 	 	to	get	you	and	other	people	 in 	 to 	 	trouble	 a 	 s 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	else	.
now	,	i	hope	that	we	all	know	 th 	 is 	 	.
there	's	a	sense	in	which	it	's	obvious	,	and	yet	,	let	me	tell	you	a	little	story	.
it	's	a	story	about	 lemon 	 ade 	 	.
a	dad	and	his	seven	-	year	-	old	son	 we 	 re 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	a	detroit	 tiger 	 s 	 	game	at	the	 ball 	 park 	 	.
his	son	 ask 	 ed 	 	him	for	some	 lemon 	 ade 	 	and	dad	went	to	the	concession	stand	to	buy	it	.
all	they	had	was	 mi 	 ke 	 	's	hard	 lemon 	 ade 	 	,	which	was	five	percent	alcohol	.
dad	,	 be 	 ing 	 	an	academic	,	had	no	idea	that	 mi 	 ke 	 	's	hard	 lemon 	 ade 	 	 contain 	 ed 	 	alcohol	.
so	he	 br 	 ought 	 	it	back	.
and	the	kid	was	 drink 	 ing 	 	it	,	and	a	security	guard	 spot 	 ted 	 	it	,	and	 call 	 ed 	 	the	police	,	who	 call 	 ed 	 	an	 ambul 	 ance 	 	that	 rush 	 ed 	 	to	the	 ball 	 park 	 	,	 whisk 	 ed 	 	the	kid	to	the	hospital	.
the	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	room	 a 	 s 	 certain 	 ed 	 	that	the	kid	had	no	alcohol	in	his	blood	.	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	ready	to	let	the	kid	go	.
but	not	so	fast	.
the	wayne	 count 	 y 	 	child	 wel 	 fare 	 	 protect 	 ion 	 	 age 	 ncy 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	no	.
and	the	child	was	 s 	 ent 	 	to	a	foster	home	for	three	 day 	 s 	 	.
at	that	point	,	can	the	child	go	home	?
well	,	a	 judg 	 e 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	 y 	 es 	 	,	but	 on 	 ly 	 	if	the	dad	 leav 	 es 	 	the	house	and	 check 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 mote 	 l 	 	.
after	two	 week 	 s 	 	,	i	'm	happy	to	report	,	the	family	was	 re 	 unit 	 ed 	 	.
but	the	 wel 	 fare 	 	 work 	 ers 	 	and	the	 ambul 	 ance 	 	people	and	the	 judg 	 e 	 	all	 s 	 aid 	 	the	same	thing	:	``	we	hate	to	do	it	but	we	have	to	follow	procedure	.	``
how	do	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	happen	?
scott	simon	,	who	told	 th 	 is 	 	story	on	npr	,	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 rule 	 s 	 	and	 procedure 	 s 	 	may	be	dumb	,	but	they	spare	you	from	 think 	 ing 	 	.	``
and	,	to	be	fair	,	 rule 	 s 	 	are	often	 impose 	 d 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	previous	 official 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	lax	and	they	let	a	child	go	back	to	an	 a 	 bus 	 ive 	 	 house 	 hold 	 	.
fair	 en 	 ough 	 	.
when	 thing 	 s 	 	go	wrong	,	 a 	 s 	 	of	course	they	do	,	we	reach	for	two	 tool 	 s 	 	to	try	to	fix	them	.
one	tool	we	reach	for	is	 rule 	 s 	 	.
better	 one 	 s 	 	,	more	of	them	.
the	second	tool	we	reach	for	is	 incentive 	 s 	 	.
better	 one 	 s 	 	,	more	of	them	.
what	else	,	after	all	,	is	there	?
we	can	 certain 	 ly 	 	see	 th 	 is 	 	in	 respons 	 e 	 	to	the	current	financial	crisis	.
 regulat 	 e 	 	,	 regulat 	 e 	 	,	 regulat 	 e 	 	.
fix	the	 incentive 	 s 	 	,	fix	the	 incentive 	 s 	 	,	fix	the	 incentive 	 s 	 	...
the	truth	is	that	 n 	 either 	 	 rule 	 s 	 	nor	 incentive 	 s 	 	how	could	you	even	write	a	rule	that	got	the	 janitor 	 s 	 	to	do	what	they	did	?
and	would	you	pay	them	a	 bon 	 us 	 	for	 be 	 ing 	 	 empath 	 ic 	 	?
it	's	preposterous	on	 it 	 s 	 	face	.
and	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	that	 a 	 s 	 	we	turn	 increasing 	 ly 	 	to	 rule 	 s 	 	,	 rule 	 s 	 	and	 incentive 	 s 	 	may	make	 thing 	 s 	 	better	in	the	short	run	,	but	they	create	a	 down 	 ward 	 	spiral	that	 make 	 s 	 	them	 wo 	 rse 	 	in	the	long	run	.
moral	skill	is	 chip 	 ped 	 	away	by	an	over	-	 reli 	 ance 	 	on	 rule 	 s 	 	that	 depriv 	 es 	 	us	of	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	 improv 	 ise 	 	and	learn	from	our	 improvisation 	 s 	 	.
and	moral	will	is	 under 	 min 	 ed 	 	by	an	incessant	appeal	to	 incentive 	 s 	 	that	destroy	our	 desir 	 e 	 	to	do	the	right	thing	.
and	 with 	 out 	 	 intend 	 ing 	 	it	,	by	 appeal 	 ing 	 	to	 rule 	 s 	 	and	 incentive 	 s 	 	,	we	are	 engag 	 ing 	 	in	a	war	on	 wis 	 dom 	 	.
let	me	just	give	you	a	few	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	,	first	of	 rule 	 s 	 	and	the	war	on	moral	skill	.
the	 lemon 	 ade 	 	story	is	one	.
second	,	no	doubt	more	familiar	to	you	,	is	the	nature	of	modern	american	education	:	 script 	 ed 	 	,	lock	-	step	 curr 	 ic 	 ula 	 	.
here	's	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	from	chicago	 kind 	 ergarten 	 	.
 read 	 ing 	 	and	 enjoy 	 ing 	 	 liter 	 ature 	 	and	 word 	 s 	 	that	begin	with	'	b.	'	``	the	bath	:	``	assemble	 student 	 s 	 	on	a	rug	and	give	 student 	 s 	 	a	 war 	 ning 	 	about	the	 danger 	 s 	 	of	hot	water	.
say	75	 item 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	script	to	teach	a	25	-	page	picture	book	.
all	over	chicago	in	every	 kind 	 ergarten 	 	class	in	the	city	,	every	teacher	is	 say 	 ing 	 	the	same	 word 	 s 	 	in	the	same	way	on	the	same	day	.
we	know	why	these	 script 	 s 	 	are	there	.
we	do	n't	trust	the	judgment	of	 teacher 	 s 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	to	let	them	loose	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	.
 script 	 s 	 	like	these	are	 insur 	 ance 	 	 poli 	 cies 	 	against	disaster	.
and	they	prevent	disaster	.
but	what	they	assure	in	 it 	 s 	 	place	is	 mediocr 	 ity 	 	.
do	n't	get	me	wrong	.	we	need	 rule 	 s 	 	!
jazz	 music 	 ians 	 	need	some	 note 	 s 	 	--	most	of	them	need	some	 note 	 s 	 	on	the	page	.
we	need	more	 rule 	 s 	 	for	the	 bank 	 ers 	 	,	god	 know 	 s 	 	.
but	too	 man 	 y 	 	 rule 	 s 	 	prevent	 accomplish 	 ed 	 	jazz	 music 	 ians 	 	from	 improv 	 is 	 ing 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	,	they	lose	 the 	 ir 	 	 gift 	 s 	 	,	or	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	they	stop	 play 	 ing 	 	 al 	 together 	 	.
now	,	how	about	 incentive 	 s 	 	?
they	seem	 clever 	 er 	 	.
if	you	have	one	reason	for	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	and	i	give	you	a	second	reason	for	 do 	 ing 	 	the	same	thing	,	it	 seem 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	logical	that	two	 reason 	 s 	 	are	better	than	one	and	you	're	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	do	it	.
right	?
well	,	not	 al 	 ways 	 	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	two	 reason 	 s 	 	to	do	the	same	thing	seem	to	compete	with	one	 an 	 other 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 compliment 	 ing 	 	,	and	they	make	people	less	 like 	 ly 	 	to	do	it	.
i	'll	just	give	you	one	 ex 	 ample 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	time	is	 rac 	 ing 	 	.
in	switzerland	,	back	about	15	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	decide	where	to	 s 	 ite 	 	nuclear	waste	 dump 	 s 	 	.
there	was	going	to	be	a	national	 refer 	 end 	 um 	 	.
some	 psycho 	 logists 	 	went	around	and	 poll 	 ed 	 	 citizen 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	well	 inform 	 ed 	 	.
and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	would	you	be	 will 	 ing 	 	to	have	a	nuclear	waste	dump	in	your	community	?	``

they	 k 	 new 	 	it	was	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
they	thought	it	would	 reduc 	 e 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 proper 	 ty 	 	 value 	 s 	 	.
but	it	had	to	go	 some 	 where 	 	and	they	had	 respons 	 ibilities 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 citizen 	 s 	 	.
the	 psycho 	 logists 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	other	people	a	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	different	question	.
they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	if	we	paid	you	six	 week 	 s 	 	'	 s 	 al 	 ary 	 	every	year	would	you	be	 will 	 ing 	 	to	have	a	nuclear	waste	dump	in	your	community	?	``
two	 reason 	 s 	 	.	it	's	my	 respons 	 ibility 	 	and	i	'm	 get 	 ting 	 	paid	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	50	percent	 say 	 ing 	 	 y 	 es 	 	,	25	percent	 s 	 aid 	 	 y 	 es 	 	.
what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	that	the	second	 th 	 is 	 	 introduc 	 tion 	 	of	incentive	 get 	 s 	 	us	so	that	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 ask 	 ing 	 	,	``	what	is	my	 respons 	 ibility 	 	?	``
all	we	ask	is	,	``	what	 serve 	 s 	 	my	 interest 	 s 	 	?	``
when	 incentive 	 s 	 	do	n't	work	,	when	ceos	 ignor 	 e 	 	the	long	-	term	health	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	in	 pur 	 suit 	 	of	short	-	term	 gain 	 s 	 	that	will	lead	to	massive	 bon 	 uses 	 	,	the	 respons 	 e 	 	is	 al 	 ways 	 	the	same	.
get	 smart 	 er 	 	 incentive 	 s 	 	.
the	truth	is	that	there	are	no	 incentive 	 s 	 	that	you	can	 dev 	 ise 	 	that	are	ever	going	to	be	smart	 en 	 ough 	 	.
any	incentive	system	can	be	 sub 	 vert 	 ed 	 	by	bad	will	.
we	need	 incentive 	 s 	 	.	people	have	to	make	a	living	.
but	 excess 	 ive 	 	 reli 	 ance 	 	on	 incentive 	 s 	 	 de 	 moralize 	 s 	 	professional	activity	in	two	 sense 	 s 	 	of	that	word	.
it	 cause 	 s 	 	people	who	engage	in	that	activity	to	lose	 moral 	 e 	 	and	it	 cause 	 s 	 	the	activity	 it 	 self 	 	to	lose	 moral 	 ity 	 	.
barack	obama	 s 	 aid 	 	,	before	he	was	 inaugu 	 rated 	 	,	``	we	must	ask	not	just	'	is	it	 profit 	 able 	 	?	'	but	'	is	it	right	?

we	see	 th 	 is 	 	in	medicine	.
and	we	 certain 	 ly 	 	see	it	in	the	world	of	business	.
it	is	obvious	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	the	way	people	want	to	do	 the 	 ir 	 	work	.
so	what	can	we	do	?
a	few	 source 	 s 	 	of	hope	:	we	ought	to	try	to	re	-	moralize	work	.
one	way	not	to	do	it	:	teach	more	 ethic 	 s 	 	 course 	 s 	 	.
there	is	no	better	way	to	show	people	that	you	're	not	serious	than	to	tie	up	 every 	 thing 	 	you	have	to	say	about	 ethic 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	little	package	with	a	bow	and	 con 	 sign 	 	it	to	the	 margin 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	 ethic 	 s 	 	course	.
what	to	do	 in 	 stead 	 	?
one	:	 celebr 	 ate 	 	moral	 exempl 	 ar 	 s 	 	.
 acknowledg 	 e 	 	,	when	you	go	to	law	school	,	that	a	little	voice	is	 whisper 	 ing 	 	in	your	ear	about	atticus	finch	.
no	10	-	year	-	old	 go 	 es 	 	to	law	school	to	do	 merge 	 rs 	 	and	 acquisit 	 ions 	 	.

but	we	learn	that	with	 sophistic 	 ation 	 	 come 	 s 	 	the	 understand 	 ing 	 	that	you	ca	n't	 acknowledg 	 e 	 	that	you	have	moral	heroes	.
well	,	 acknowledg 	 e 	 	them	.
be	proud	that	you	have	them	.
 celebr 	 ate 	 	them	.
and	demand	that	the	people	who	teach	you	 acknowledg 	 e 	 	them	and	 celebr 	 ate 	 	them	too	.
that	's	one	thing	we	can	do	.
i	do	n't	know	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	remember	 th 	 is 	 	:	 an 	 other 	 	moral	hero	,	15	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	aaron	feuerstein	,	who	was	the	head	of	malden	 mill 	 s 	 	in	massachusetts	--	they	made	polartec	--	the	 factor 	 y 	 	 burn 	 ed 	 	down	.
3,000	 employ 	 ees 	 	.	he	 ke 	 pt 	 	every	one	of	them	on	the	 pay 	 roll 	 	.
why	?	 be 	 cause 	 	it	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	a	disaster	for	them	and	for	the	community	if	he	had	let	them	go	.
``	 may 	 be 	 	on	paper	our	company	is	worth	less	to	wall	street	,	but	i	can	tell	you	it	's	worth	more	.	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	fine	.	``
just	at	 th 	 is 	 	ted	we	heard	 talk 	 s 	 	from	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	moral	heroes	.
two	 we 	 re 	 	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	inspiring	to	me	.
one	was	ray	anderson	,	who	 turn 	 ed 	 	--	--	 turn 	 ed 	 	,	you	know	,	a	part	of	the	 e 	 vil 	 	empire	 in 	 to 	 	a	zero	-	 foot 	 print 	 	,	or	 al 	 most 	 	zero	-	 foot 	 print 	 	business	.
why	?	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	the	right	thing	to	do	.
and	a	 bon 	 us 	 	he	's	 discover 	 ing 	 	is	he	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	to	make	even	more	money	.
his	 employ 	 ees 	 	are	inspired	by	the	effort	.
why	?	 be 	 cause 	 	there	happy	to	be	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	the	right	thing	to	do	.
 yester 	 day 	 	we	heard	willie	smits	talk	about	re	-	foresting	in	indonesia	.
in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	perfect	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	took	the	will	to	do	the	right	thing	.
god	 know 	 s 	 	it	took	a	huge	amount	of	technical	skill	.
i	'm	 boggl 	 ed 	 	at	how	much	he	and	his	 associate 	 s 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	to	know	in	order	to	plot	 th 	 is 	 	out	.
but	most	 import 	 ant 	 	to	make	it	work	--	and	he	 emphas 	 ized 	 	 th 	 is 	 	--	is	that	it	took	 know 	 ing 	 	the	people	in	the	 commun 	 ities 	 	.
 un 	 less 	 	the	people	you	're	 work 	 ing 	 	with	are	 be 	 hind 	 	you	,	 th 	 is 	 	will	fail	.
and	there	is	n't	a	formula	to	tell	you	how	to	get	the	people	 be 	 hind 	 	you	,	 be 	 cause 	 	different	people	in	different	 commun 	 ities 	 	organize	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	in	different	ways	.
so	there	's	a	lot	here	at	ted	,	and	at	other	 place 	 s 	 	,	to	 celebr 	 ate 	 	.
and	you	do	n't	have	to	be	a	mega	-	hero	.
there	are	 ordin 	 ary 	 	heroes	.	 ordin 	 ary 	 	heroes	like	the	 janitor 	 s 	 	who	are	worth	 celebr 	 ating 	 	too	.
 a 	 s 	 	 practitioner 	 s 	 	each	and	every	one	of	us	should	 striv 	 e 	 	to	be	 ordin 	 ary 	 	,	if	not	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	heroes	.
 a 	 s 	 	 head 	 s 	 	of	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	,	we	should	 striv 	 e 	 	to	create	 environment 	 s 	 	that	 encourag 	 e 	 	and	nurture	both	moral	skill	and	moral	will	.
even	the	 wise 	 st 	 	and	most	well	-	meaning	people	will	give	up	if	they	have	to	swim	against	the	current	in	the	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	in	which	they	work	.
if	you	run	an	 organ 	 ization 	 	,	you	should	be	 s 	 ure 	 	that	 non 	 e 	 	of	the	 job 	 s 	 	--	 non 	 e 	 	of	the	 job 	 s 	 	--	have	job	 de 	 script 	 ions 	 	like	the	job	 de 	 script 	 ions 	 	of	the	 janitor 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	truth	is	that	any	work	that	you	do	that	 involve 	 s 	 	 interact 	 ion 	 	with	other	people	is	moral	work	.
and	any	moral	work	 depend 	 s 	 	 up 	 on 	 	practical	 wis 	 dom 	 	.
and	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	most	 import 	 ant 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 teacher 	 s 	 	,	we	should	 striv 	 e 	 	to	be	the	 ordin 	 ary 	 	heroes	,	the	moral	 exempl 	 ar 	 s 	 	,	to	the	people	we	mentor	.
and	there	are	a	few	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	have	to	remember	 a 	 s 	 	 teacher 	 s 	 	.
one	is	that	we	are	 al 	 ways 	 	 teach 	 ing 	 	.
 some 	 one 	 	is	 al 	 ways 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	.
the	camera	is	 al 	 ways 	 	on	.
bill	 gate 	 s 	 	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	education	and	,	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	the	model	that	kipp	was	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	:
``	knowledge	is	power	.	``
and	he	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	a	lot	of	the	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	kipp	is	 do 	 ing 	 	to	take	inner	-	city	 kid 	 s 	 	and	turn	them	in	the	direction	of	college	.
i	want	to	focus	on	one	 part 	 icular 	 	thing	kipp	is	 do 	 ing 	 	that	bill	did	n't	 ment 	 ion 	 	.
that	is	that	they	have	come	to	the	 real 	 ization 	 	that	the	single	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	 kid 	 s 	 	need	to	learn	is	character	.
they	need	to	learn	to	respect	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
they	need	to	learn	to	respect	 the 	 ir 	 	 school 	 mate 	 s 	 	.
they	need	to	learn	to	respect	 the 	 ir 	 	 teacher 	 s 	 	.
and	,	most	 import 	 ant 	 	,	they	need	to	learn	to	respect	 learn 	 ing 	 	.
that	's	the	principle	 object 	 ive 	 	.
if	you	do	that	,	the	rest	is	just	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	a	coast	 down 	 hill 	 	.
and	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	:	the	way	you	teach	these	 thing 	 s 	 	to	the	 kid 	 s 	 	is	by	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	and	all	the	other	staff	 em 	 body 	 	it	every	minute	of	every	day	.
obama	 appeal 	 ed 	 	to	virtue	.
and	i	think	he	was	right	.
and	the	virtue	i	think	we	need	above	all	 other 	 s 	 	is	practical	 wis 	 dom 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	what	 allow 	 s 	 	other	 virtue 	 s 	 	--	 honest 	 y 	 	,	 kind 	 ness 	 	,	courage	and	so	on	--	to	be	 dis 	 play 	 ed 	 	at	the	right	time	and	in	the	right	way	.
he	 al 	 so 	 	 appeal 	 ed 	 	to	hope	.
right	 aga 	 in 	 	.
i	think	there	is	reason	for	hope	.
i	think	people	want	to	be	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	be	virtuous	.
in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	,	it	's	what	ted	is	all	about	.
 want 	 ing 	 	to	do	the	right	thing	in	the	right	way	for	the	right	 reason 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 wis 	 dom 	 	is	 with 	 in 	 	the	grasp	of	each	and	every	one	of	us	if	 on 	 ly 	 	we	start	 pay 	 ing 	 	attention	.
 pay 	 ing 	 	attention	to	what	we	do	,	to	how	we	do	it	,	and	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	most	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	to	the	structure	of	the	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	which	we	work	,	so	 a 	 s 	 	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	it	 en 	 able 	 s 	 	us	and	other	people	to	develop	 wis 	 dom 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 hav 	 ing 	 	it	 suppress 	 ed 	 	.
