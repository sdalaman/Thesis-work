well	,	first	of	all	,	let	me	thank	emeka	--	 a 	 s 	 	a	matter	of	fact	,	ted	global	--	for	 put 	 ting 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	together	.
 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	is	going	to	rank	 a 	 s 	 	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	in	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	21st	century	.
think	african	 government 	 s 	 	will	put	together	a	 con 	 ference 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	?
you	think	the	a.u	.	will	put	together	a	 con 	 ference 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	?
even	before	they	do	that	they	will	ask	for	foreign	aid	.
i	would	 al 	 so 	 	like	to	pay	 hom 	 age 	 	and	honor	to	the	ted	 fellow 	 s 	 	june	arunga	,	james	shikwati	,	andrew	,	and	the	other	ted	 fellow 	 s 	 	.
i	call	them	the	cheetah	generation	.
the	cheetah	generation	is	a	new	breed	of	africans	who	brook	no	 non 	 sense 	 	about	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	.
they	understand	what	 account 	 ability 	 	and	 demo 	 cracy 	 	is	.
they	're	not	going	to	wait	for	government	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	for	them	.
that	's	the	cheetah	generation	,
and	africa	's	 salv 	 ation 	 	 rest 	 s 	 	on	the	 back 	 s 	 	of	these	 cheetah 	 s 	 	.
in	contrast	,	of	course	,	we	have	the	hippo	generation	.
the	hippo	generation	are	the	 rul 	 ing 	 	 elite 	 s 	 	.	they	are	 s 	 tuck 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	intellectual	patch	.	 complain 	 ing 	 	about	 colonial 	 ism 	 	and	 imperial 	 ism 	 	,	they	would	n't	move	one	foot	.
if	you	ask	them	to	reform	the	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	,	they	're	not	going	to	reform	it	 be 	 cause 	 	they	benefit	from	the	 rot 	 ten 	 	 stat 	 us 	 	quo	.
now	,	there	are	a	lot	of	africans	who	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 ang 	 ry 	 	,	 ang 	 ry 	 	at	the	condition	of	africa	.
now	,	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	a	continent	that	is	not	poor	.
it	is	rich	in	mineral	 resource 	 s 	 	,	natural	mineral	 resource 	 s 	 	.
but	the	mineral	wealth	of	africa	is	not	 be 	 ing 	 	 util 	 ized 	 	to	lift	 it 	 s 	 	people	out	of	poverty	.
that	's	what	 make 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	africans	 ver 	 y 	 	 ang 	 ry 	 	.	and	in	a	way	,	africa	is	more	than	a	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	,	in	more	ways	than	one	.
there	's	 an 	 other 	 	 endur 	 ing 	 	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	,	and	that	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	is	that	there	are	so	 man 	 y 	 	people	,	so	 man 	 y 	 	 government 	 s 	 	,	so	 man 	 y 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	who	want	to	help	the	people	in	africa	.	they	do	n't	understand	.
now	,	we	're	not	 say 	 ing 	 	do	n't	help	africa	.
 help 	 ing 	 	africa	is	noble	.
but	 help 	 ing 	 	africa	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	theater	of	the	absurd	.
it	's	like	the	blind	 lead 	 ing 	 	the	 clue 	 less 	 	.
there	are	certain	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	need	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	.
africa	's	 beg 	 ging 	 	-	bowl	 leak 	 s 	 	.
did	you	know	that	40	percent	of	the	wealth	 create 	 d 	 	in	africa	is	not	 invest 	 ed 	 	here	in	africa	?
it	's	taken	out	of	africa	.
that	's	what	the	world	bank	 say 	 s 	 	.
look	at	africa	's	 beg 	 ging 	 	-	bowl	.
it	 leak 	 s 	 	 horr 	 ibly 	 	.
there	are	people	who	think	that	we	should	pour	more	money	,	more	aid	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	bowl	which	 leak 	 s 	 	.
what	are	the	 leak 	 age 	 s 	 	?
 corrupt 	 ion 	 	 al 	 one 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	africa	148	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	put	that	 a 	 side 	 	.
capital	flight	out	of	africa	,	80	billion	a	year	.
put	that	 a 	 side 	 	.
let	's	take	food	 import 	 s 	 	.
every	year	africa	 s 	 pend 	 s 	 	20	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	import	food	.	just	add	that	up	,	all	these	 leak 	 age 	 s 	 	.
that	's	far	more	than	the	50	billion	tony	blair	 want 	 s 	 	to	raise	for	africa	.
now	,	back	in	the	1960s	africa	not	 on 	 ly 	 	fed	 it 	 self 	 	,	it	 al 	 so 	 	 export 	 ed 	 	food	.
not	 any 	 more 	 	.
we	know	that	 some 	 thing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	wrong	.	you	know	it	,	i	know	it	,	but	let	's	not	waste	our	time	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	these	 mistak 	 es 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	'll	 s 	 pend 	 	all	day	here	.
let	's	move	on	,	and	flip	over	to	the	next	chapter	,
and	that	's	what	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	is	all	about	--	the	next	chapter	.
the	next	chapter	 begin 	 s 	 	with	first	of	all	,	 ask 	 ing 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 th 	 is 	 	fundamental	question	,	``	whom	do	we	want	to	help	in	africa	?	``
there	is	the	people	,	and	then	there	is	the	government	or	 lead 	 ers 	 	.
now	,	the	previous	speaker	before	me	,	idris	mohammed	,	 indic 	 ated 	 	that	we	've	had	 a 	 by 	 s 	 mal 	 	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	in	africa	.
that	 character 	 ization 	 	,	in	my	view	,	is	even	more	 char 	 it 	 able 	 	.
i	belong	to	an	 inter 	 net 	 	 discuss 	 ion 	 	forum	,	an	african	 inter 	 net 	 	 discuss 	 ion 	 	forum	,	and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	since	1960	,	we	've	had	 exact 	 ly 	 	204	african	 head 	 s 	 	of	state	,	since	1960	.	``
and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	to	name	me	just	20	good	 lead 	 ers 	 	,	just	20	good	 lead 	 ers 	 	--	you	may	want	to	take	 th 	 is 	 	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	 challeng 	 e 	 	 your 	 self 	 	.
i	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	to	name	me	just	20	.
 every 	 body 	 	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	nelson	mandela	,	of	course	.
kwame	nkrumah	,	nyerere	,	kenyatta	--	 some 	 body 	 	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	idi	amin	.	i	let	that	pass	.
my	point	is	,	they	could	n't	go	beyond	15	.
even	if	they	had	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	name	me	20	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	that	tell	you	?
20	out	of	204	 mean 	 s 	 	that	the	vast	 major 	 ity 	 	of	the	african	 lead 	 ers 	 	 fail 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	people	.
and	if	you	look	at	them	,	the	 s 	 late 	 	of	the	post	-	colonial	 lead 	 ers 	 	--	an	 assort 	 ment 	 	of	 militar 	 y 	 	 fu 	 fu 	 	 head 	 s 	 	,
swiss	-	bank	 social 	 ists 	 	,	crocodile	 liber 	 ators 	 	,	vampire	 elite 	 s 	 	,	 qu 	 ack 	 	 revolution 	 aries 	 	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	is	a	far	cry	from	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	that	africans	have	known	for	centuries	.
the	second	false	 pre 	 mise 	 	that	we	make	when	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	help	africa	is	that	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	we	think	that	there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	a	government	in	africa	that	 care 	 s 	 	about	 it 	 s 	 	people	,	 serve 	 s 	 	the	 interest 	 s 	 	of	the	people	,	and	 represent 	 s 	 	the	people	.
there	is	one	 part 	 icular 	 	quote	--	a	lesotho	chief	once	 s 	 aid 	 	that	``	here	in	lesotho	,	we	've	got	two	 problem 	 s 	 	:	 rat 	 s 	 	and	the	government	.	``
what	you	and	i	understand	 a 	 s 	 	a	government	 do 	 es 	 	n't	exist	in	 man 	 y 	 	african	 count 	 ries 	 	.
in	fact	,	what	we	call	our	 government 	 s 	 	are	vampire	 state 	 s 	 	.
vampires	 be 	 cause 	 	they	suck	the	economic	 vital 	 ity 	 	out	of	 the 	 ir 	 	people	.
government	is	the	problem	in	africa	.
a	vampire	state	is	the	government	--	--	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 hijack 	 ed 	 	by	a	 phal 	 anx 	 	of	 bandit 	 s 	 	and	 crook 	 s 	 	who	use	the	 instrument 	 s 	 	of	state	power	to	enrich	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 cr 	 onies 	 	,	and	 tribe 	 s 	 men 	 	and	exclude	 every 	 body 	 	else	.
the	 rich 	 est 	 	people	in	africa	are	 head 	 s 	 	-	of	-	state	and	 mini 	 sters 	 	,	and	 quit 	 e 	 	often	the	chief	bandit	is	the	head	-	of	-	state	 him 	 self 	 	.
where	do	they	get	 the 	 ir 	 	money	?
by	creating	wealth	?
no	.
by	 rak 	 ing 	 	it	off	the	 back 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 suffer 	 ing 	 	people	.
that	's	not	wealth	creation	.	it	's	wealth	 re 	 distribut 	 ion 	 	.
the	third	fundamental	issue	that	we	have	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	is	that	if	we	want	to	help	the	african	people	,	we	must	know	where	the	african	people	are	.
take	any	african	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
an	african	 eco 	 nomy 	 	can	be	broken	up	 in 	 to 	 	three	 sector 	 s 	 	.
there	is	the	modern	sector	,	there	is	the	 inform 	 al 	 	sector	and	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	sector	.
the	modern	sector	is	the	 abo 	 de 	 	of	the	 elite 	 s 	 	.
it	's	the	seat	of	government	.
in	 man 	 y 	 	african	 count 	 ries 	 	the	modern	sector	is	lost	.
it	's	 dy 	 s 	 functional 	 	.
it	is	a	 mere 	 tric 	 ious 	 	 fan 	 dan 	 go 	 	of	 import 	 ed 	 	 system 	 s 	 	,	which	the	 elite 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	do	n't	understand	.
that	is	the	source	of	 man 	 y 	 	of	africa	's	 problem 	 s 	 	where	the	 struggle 	 s 	 	for	 politic 	 al 	 	power	emanate	and	then	 s 	 pill 	 	over	onto	the	 inform 	 al 	 	and	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	sector	,	 claim 	 ing 	 	 innoc 	 ent 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
now	the	modern	sector	,	of	course	,	is	where	a	lot	of	the	 develop 	 ment 	 	aid	and	 resource 	 s 	 	went	 in 	 to 	 	.
more	than	80	percent	of	 iv 	 ory 	 	coast	's	 develop 	 ment 	 	went	 in 	 to 	 	the	modern	sector	.
the	other	 sector 	 s 	 	,	the	 inform 	 al 	 	and	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	 sector 	 s 	 	,	are	where	you	find	the	 major 	 ity 	 	of	the	african	people	,
the	real	people	in	africa	.	that	's	where	you	find	them	.
now	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	it	 make 	 s 	 	common	sense	that	if	you	want	to	help	the	people	,	you	go	where	the	people	are	.
but	that	's	not	what	we	did	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	matter	of	fact	,	we	 neglect 	 ed 	 	the	 inform 	 al 	 	and	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	 sector 	 s 	 	.
now	,	 tradition 	 al 	 	sector	is	where	africa	 produce 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 agricultur 	 e 	 	,	which	is	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	why	africa	ca	n't	feed	 it 	 self 	 	,	and	that	's	why	it	must	import	food	.
all	right	,	you	can	not	develop	africa	by	 ignor 	 ing 	 	the	 inform 	 al 	 	and	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	 sector 	 s 	 	.
and	you	ca	n't	develop	the	 inform 	 al 	 	and	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	 sector 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	an	 operation 	 al 	 	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	how	these	two	 sector 	 s 	 	work	.
these	two	 sector 	 s 	 	,	let	me	 de 	 scribe 	 	to	you	,	have	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 indi 	 genous 	 	 institution 	 s 	 	.
first	one	is	the	 politic 	 al 	 	system	.
 tradition 	 ally 	 	,	africans	hate	 government 	 s 	 	.	they	hate	 tyrann 	 y 	 	.
if	you	look	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 tradition 	 al 	 	 system 	 s 	 	,	africans	organize	 the 	 ir 	 	 state 	 s 	 	in	two	 type 	 s 	 	.
the	first	one	 belong 	 s 	 	to	 t 	 hose 	 	ethnic	 socie 	 ties 	 	who	 believ 	 e 	 	that	the	state	was	 necess 	 arily 	 	 tyrann 	 ous 	 	,	so	they	did	n't	want	to	have	 any 	 thing 	 	to	do	with	any	 central 	 ized 	 	 author 	 ity 	 	.
these	 socie 	 ties 	 	are	the	ibo	,	the	somali	,	the	kikuyus	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	.	they	have	no	 chief 	 s 	 	.
the	other	ethnic	 group 	 s 	 	,	which	did	have	 chief 	 s 	 	,	made	 s 	 ure 	 	that	they	 surround 	 ed 	 	the	 chief 	 s 	 	with	 council 	 s 	 	 up 	 on 	 	 council 	 s 	 	 up 	 on 	 	 council 	 s 	 	to	prevent	them	from	 ab 	 using 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	power	.
in	ashanti	tradition	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	the	chief	can	not	make	any	decision	 with 	 out 	 	the	 con 	 curr 	 ence 	 	of	the	council	of	 elder 	 s 	 	.
 with 	 out 	 	the	council	the	chief	ca	n't	pass	any	law	,	and	if	the	chief	 do 	 es 	 	n't	govern	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	the	will	of	the	people	he	will	be	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	.
if	not	,	the	people	will	abandon	the	chief	,	go	 some 	 where 	 	else	and	set	up	a	new	 settle 	 ment 	 	.
and	even	if	you	look	in	ancient	african	 empire 	 s 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	all	 organize 	 d 	 	around	one	 part 	 icular 	 	principle	--	the	 con 	 fed 	 er 	 acy 	 	principle	,	which	is	 character 	 ized 	 	by	a	great	deal	of	 d 	 evolution 	 	of	 author 	 ity 	 	,	 de 	 central 	 ization 	 	of	power	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	have	 de 	 scribed 	 	to	you	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	part	of	africa	's	 indi 	 genous 	 	 politic 	 al 	 	heritage	.
now	,	 compar 	 e 	 	that	to	the	modern	 system 	 s 	 	the	 rul 	 ing 	 	 elite 	 s 	 	 establish 	 ed 	 	on	africa	.
it	is	a	total	far	cry	.
in	the	economic	system	in	 tradition 	 al 	 	africa	,	the	 mean 	 s 	 	of	production	is	 private 	 ly 	 	owned	.
it	's	owned	by	 extend 	 ed 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	.
you	see	,	in	the	west	,	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	economic	and	social	unit	is	the	individual	.
the	american	will	say	,	``	i	am	 be 	 cause 	 	i	am	,	and	i	can	damn	well	do	 any 	 thing 	 	i	want	,	 any 	 time 	 	.	``
the	accent	is	on	the	``	i.	``
in	africa	,	the	africans	say	,	``	i	am	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	are	.	``
the	``	we	``	 con 	 note 	 s 	 	community	--	the	 extend 	 ed 	 	family	system	.
the	 extend 	 ed 	 	family	system	 pool 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	together	.
they	own	 farm 	 s 	 	.	they	decide	what	to	do	,	what	to	produce	.
they	do	n't	take	any	 order 	 s 	 	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 chief 	 s 	 	.	they	decide	what	to	do	.
and	when	they	produce	 the 	 ir 	 	 crop 	 s 	 	,	they	sell	the	 sur 	 plus 	 	on	 market 	 place 	 s 	 	.
when	they	make	a	profit	it	is	 the 	 ir 	 s 	 	to	keep	,	not	for	the	chief	to	 sequest 	 er 	 	it	from	them	.
so	,	in	a	 nut 	 shell 	 	,	what	we	had	in	 tradition 	 al 	 	africa	was	a	free	-	market	system	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	 market 	 s 	 	in	africa	before	the	 colonial 	 ists 	 	 steppe 	 d 	 	foot	on	the	continent	.
timbuktu	was	one	great	big	market	town	.
kano	,	salaga	--	they	 we 	 re 	 	all	there	.
even	if	you	go	to	west	africa	,	you	notice	that	market	activity	in	west	africa	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 dominate 	 d 	 	by	women	.
so	,	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	appropriate	that	 th 	 is 	 	section	is	 call 	 ed 	 	a	 market 	 place 	 	.
the	market	is	not	alien	to	africa	.
what	africans	 practice 	 d 	 	was	a	different	form	of	 capital 	 ism 	 	,	but	then	after	 in 	 depend 	 ence 	 	,	all	of	a	sudden	,	 market 	 s 	 	,	 capital 	 ism 	 	 be 	 came 	 	a	western	institution	,	and	the	 lead 	 ers 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	africans	 we 	 re 	 	ready	for	 social 	 ism 	 	.
 non 	 sense 	 	.
and	even	then	,	what	kind	of	 social 	 ism 	 	did	they	practice	?
the	 social 	 ism 	 	that	they	 practice 	 d 	 	was	a	peculiar	form	of	swiss	-	bank	 social 	 ism 	 	,	which	 allow 	 ed 	 	the	 head 	 s 	 	of	 state 	 s 	 	and	the	 mini 	 sters 	 	to	rape	and	plunder	africa	's	 treasu 	 ries 	 	for	deposit	in	switzerland	.
that	is	not	the	kind	of	system	africans	had	known	for	centuries	.
what	do	we	do	now	?
go	back	to	africa	's	 indi 	 genous 	 	 institution 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	we	charge	the	 cheetah 	 s 	 	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	 inform 	 al 	 	 sector 	 s 	 	,	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	 sector 	 s 	 	.	that	's	where	you	find	the	african	people	.
and	i	'd	like	to	show	you	a	quick	little	video	about	the	 inform 	 al 	 	sector	,	about	the	boat	-	building	that	i	,	 my 	 self 	 	,	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	mobilize	africans	in	the	diaspora	to	invest	in	.
could	you	 pleas 	 e 	 	show	that	?
the	men	are	going	 fish 	 ing 	 	in	these	small	 boat 	 s 	 	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	it	's	an	enterprise	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	by	a	local	ghanaian	entrepreneur	,	using	his	own	capital	.
he	's	 get 	 ting 	 	no	 assist 	 ance 	 	from	the	government	,	and	he	's	building	a	second	,	 big 	 ger 	 	boat	.
a	 big 	 ger 	 	boat	will	mean	more	fish	will	be	caught	and	 land 	 ed 	 	.
it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	he	will	be	able	to	employ	more	ghanaians	.
it	 al 	 so 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	he	will	be	able	to	generate	wealth	.
and	then	it	will	have	what	 economist 	 s 	 	call	external	 effect 	 s 	 	on	a	local	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
all	that	you	need	to	do	,	all	that	the	 elite 	 s 	 	need	to	do	,	is	to	move	 th 	 is 	 	operation	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	 en 	 closed 	 	so	that	the	operation	can	be	made	more	efficient	.
now	,	it	is	not	just	 th 	 is 	 	 inform 	 al 	 	sector	.	there	is	 al 	 so 	 	 tradition 	 al 	 	medicine	.
80	percent	of	africans	still	 re 	 ly 	 	on	 tradition 	 al 	 	medicine	.
the	modern	 health 	 care 	 	sector	 ha 	 s 	 	 total 	 ly 	 	 collapse 	 d 	 	.	now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	area	--	i	mean	,	there	is	a	 treasu 	 re 	 	trove	of	wealth	in	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	medicine	area	.
