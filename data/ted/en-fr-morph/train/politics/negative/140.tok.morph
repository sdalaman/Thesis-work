i	told	you	three	 thing 	 s 	 	last	year	.
i	told	you	that	the	 statistic 	 s 	 	of	the	world	have	not	 be 	 en 	 	made	 proper 	 ly 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	of	that	,	we	still	have	the	old	 mind 	 set 	 	of	 develop 	 ing 	 	in	 industrial 	 ized 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	which	is	wrong	.
and	that	 animate 	 d 	 	 graphic 	 s 	 	can	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
 thing 	 s 	 	are	changing
and	 to 	 day 	 	,	on	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	statistic	division	home	page	,	it	 say 	 s 	 	,	by	first	of	may	,	full	access	to	the	 data 	 base 	 s 	 	.
and	if	i	could	share	the	image	with	you	on	the	screen	.
so	three	 thing 	 s 	 	have	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
u.n.	 open 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	statistic	 data 	 base 	 s 	 	,	and	we	have	a	new	version	of	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	up	 work 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	beta	on	the	net	,	so	you	do	n't	have	to	download	it	any	 long 	 er 	 	.	and	let	me	repeat	what	you	saw	last	year	.
the	 bubble 	 s 	 	are	the	 count 	 ries 	 	.
here	you	have	the	 fertil 	 ity 	 	rate	--	the	number	of	children	per	woman	--	and	there	you	have	the	length	of	life	in	 year 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	1950	--	 t 	 hose 	 	 we 	 re 	 	the	 industrial 	 ized 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	.
at	that	time	there	was	a	``	we	``	and	``	them	.	``
there	was	a	huge	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	the	world	.
but	then	it	 change 	 d 	 	,	and	it	went	on	 quit 	 e 	 	well	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 happen 	 s 	 	.
you	can	see	how	 chin 	 a 	 	is	the	red	,	big	bubble	.	the	blue	there	is	india	.
a	little	more	serious	 th 	 is 	 	year	in	 show 	 ing 	 	you	how	 thing 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 change 	 d 	 	.
and	it	's	africa	that	 stand 	 s 	 	out	 a 	 s 	 	the	problem	down	here	,	 do 	 es 	 	n't	it	?
large	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	still	,	and	the	hiv	 epi 	 demic 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	down	the	 count 	 ries 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	more	or	less	what	we	saw	last	year	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	it	will	go	on	 in 	 to 	 	the	future	.
and	i	will	talk	on	,	is	 th 	 is 	 	possible	?
 be 	 cause 	 	you	see	now	,	i	 present 	 ed 	 	 statistic 	 s 	 	that	do	n't	exist	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	we	are	.
will	it	be	possible	that	 th 	 is 	 	will	happen	?
i	cover	my	 life 	 time 	 	here	,	you	know	?
i	expect	to	live	100	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	we	are	 to 	 day 	 	.
now	could	we	look	here	 in 	 stead 	 	at	the	economic	 situ 	 ation 	 	in	the	world	?
and	i	would	like	to	show	that	against	child	 surviv 	 al 	 	.
we	'll	swap	the	axis	.	here	you	have	child	 mortal 	 ity 	 	--	that	is	,	 surviv 	 al 	 	--	four	 kid 	 s 	 	 dy 	 ing 	 	there	,	200	 dy 	 ing 	 	there	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	gdp	per	capita	on	 th 	 is 	 	axis	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	2007	.
and	if	i	go	back	in	time	,	i	've	 add 	 ed 	 	some	 historic 	 al 	 	 statistic 	 s 	 	--	here	we	go	,	here	we	go	,	here	we	go	--	not	so	much	 statistic 	 s 	 	100	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
some	 count 	 ries 	 	still	had	 statistic 	 s 	 	.
we	are	looking	down	in	the	 archiv 	 e 	 	,	and	when	we	are	down	 in 	 to 	 	1820	,	there	is	 on 	 ly 	 	austria	and	sweden	that	can	produce	 number 	 s 	 	.
but	they	 we 	 re 	 	down	here	.	they	had	1,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	per	person	per	year	.
and	they	lost	one	-	fifth	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	before	 the 	 ir 	 	first	 birth 	 day 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 happen 	 s 	 	in	the	world	,	if	we	play	the	entire	world	.	how	they	got	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	 rich 	 er 	 	and	 rich 	 er 	 	,	and	they	add	 statistic 	 s 	 	.
is	n't	it	 beaut 	 iful 	 	when	they	get	 statistic 	 s 	 	?
you	see	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	that	?
and	here	,	children	do	n't	live	 long 	 er 	 	.
the	last	century	,	1870	,	was	bad	for	the	 kid 	 s 	 	in	europe	,	 be 	 cause 	 	most	of	 th 	 is 	 	 statistic 	 s 	 	is	europe	.
it	was	 on 	 ly 	 	by	the	turn	of	the	century	that	more	than	90	percent	of	the	children	 surviv 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	first	year	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	india	coming	up	,	with	the	first	data	from	india	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	moving	away	here	,	 earn 	 ing 	 	more	money	.
and	we	will	soon	see	 chin 	 a 	 	coming	up	in	the	 ver 	 y 	 	far	end	corner	here	.
and	it	 move 	 s 	 	up	with	mao	tse	-	tung	 get 	 ting 	 	health	,	not	 get 	 ting 	 	so	rich	.
there	he	 di 	 ed 	 	,	then	deng	xiaoping	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	money	.	it	 move 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	way	over	here	.
and	the	 bubble 	 s 	 	keep	moving	up	there	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	the	world	 look 	 s 	 	like	 to 	 day 	 	.
let	us	have	a	look	at	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
we	have	a	function	here	--	i	can	tell	the	world	,	``	stay	where	you	are	.	``	and	i	take	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	--	we	still	want	to	see	the	 back 	 ground 	 	--	i	put	them	up	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	now	we	go	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	.
and	we	can	see	that	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 go 	 es 	 	to	the	right	of	the	 main 	 stream 	 	.
they	are	on	the	money	side	all	the	time	.
and	down	in	1915	,	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	was	a	neighbor	of	india	--	present	,	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	india	.
and	that	 mean 	 s 	 	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	was	 rich 	 er 	 	,	but	lost	more	 kid 	 s 	 	than	india	is	 do 	 ing 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	 proportion 	 ally 	 	.
and	look	here	--	 compar 	 e 	 	to	the	philippines	of	 to 	 day 	 	.
the	philippines	of	 to 	 day 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 most 	 	the	same	 eco 	 nomy 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	first	world	war	.
but	we	have	to	 br 	 ing 	 	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	forward	 quit 	 e 	 	a	while	to	find	the	same	health	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	have	in	the	philippines	.
about	1957	here	,	the	health	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	is	the	same	 a 	 s 	 	the	philippines	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	drama	of	 th 	 is 	 	world	which	 man 	 y 	 	call	 global 	 ized 	 	,	is	that	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	,	arabic	 count 	 ries 	 	,	latin	america	,	are	much	more	 a 	 head 	 	in	 be 	 ing 	 	 health 	 y 	 	,	educated	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	human	 resource 	 s 	 	than	they	are	 economic 	 ally 	 	.
there	's	a	 discrep 	 ancy 	 	in	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	 to 	 day 	 	in	the	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	.
there	now	,	social	 benefit 	 s 	 	,	social	progress	,	are	going	 a 	 head 	 	of	 economic 	 al 	 	progress	.
and	1957	--	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	had	the	same	 eco 	 nomy 	 	 a 	 s 	 	chile	 ha 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	how	long	do	we	have	to	 br 	 ing 	 	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	to	get	the	same	health	 a 	 s 	 	chile	 ha 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	?
i	think	we	have	to	go	,	there	--	we	have	2001	,	or	2002	--	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	the	same	health	 a 	 s 	 	chile	.
chile	's	 catch 	 ing 	 	up	!
 with 	 in 	 	some	 year 	 s 	 	chile	may	have	better	child	 surviv 	 al 	 	than	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	a	change	,	that	you	have	 th 	 is 	 	lag	of	more	or	less	30	,	40	 year 	 s 	 	'	 differ 	 ence 	 	on	the	health	.
and	 be 	 hind 	 	the	health	is	the	 education 	 al 	 	level	.
and	there	's	a	lot	of	 infra 	 structure 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	general	human	 resource 	 s 	 	are	there	.
now	we	can	take	away	 th 	 is 	 	--	and	i	would	like	to	show	you	the	rate	of	speed	,	the	rate	of	change	,	how	fast	they	have	gone	.
and	we	go	back	to	1920	,	and	i	want	to	look	at	japan	.
and	i	want	to	look	at	sweden	and	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'm	going	to	stage	a	race	here	between	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	 yellow 	 ish 	 	ford	here	and	the	red	toyota	down	there	,	and	the	 brow 	 nish 	 	volvo	.	and	here	we	go	.	here	we	go	.
the	toyota	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	bad	start	down	here	,	you	can	see	,	and	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	ford	is	going	off	-	road	there	.
and	the	volvo	is	 do 	 ing 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	fine	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	war	.	the	toyota	got	off	track	,	and	now	the	toyota	is	coming	on	the	 health 	 ier 	 	side	of	sweden	--	can	you	see	that	?
and	they	are	taking	over	sweden	,	and	they	are	now	 health 	 ier 	 	than	sweden	.
that	's	the	part	where	i	 s 	 old 	 	the	volvo	and	 b 	 ought 	 	the	toyota	.
and	now	we	can	see	that	the	rate	of	change	was	enormous	in	japan	.
they	 re 	 ally 	 	caught	up	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 change 	 s 	 	 gradu 	 ally 	 	.
we	have	to	look	over	 generation 	 s 	 	to	understand	it	.
and	let	me	show	you	my	own	sort	of	family	 histo 	 ry 	 	--	we	made	these	 graph 	 s 	 	here	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	same	thing	,	money	down	there	,	and	health	,	you	know	?
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	family	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	sweden	,	1830	,	when	my	great	-	great	-	grandma	was	born	.
sweden	was	like	sierra	leone	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	when	great	-	grandma	was	born	,	1863	.
and	sweden	was	like	mozambique	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	when	my	grandma	was	born	,	1891	.
she	took	care	of	me	 a 	 s 	 	a	child	,	so	i	'm	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	statistic	now	--	now	it	's	 or 	 al 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	in	my	family	.
that	's	when	i	 believ 	 e 	 	 statistic 	 s 	 	,	when	it	's	grandma	-	 ver 	 ified 	 	 statistic 	 s 	 	.
i	think	it	's	the	best	way	of	 ver 	 ifying 	 	 historic 	 al 	 	 statistic 	 s 	 	.
sweden	was	like	ghana	.
it	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	see	the	enormous	 divers 	 ity 	 	 with 	 in 	 	sub	-	saharan	africa	.
i	told	you	last	year	,	i	'll	tell	you	 aga 	 in 	 	,	my	mother	was	born	in	egypt	,	and	i	--	who	am	i	?
i	'm	the	mexican	in	the	family	.
and	my	daughter	,	she	was	born	in	chile	,	and	the	grand	-	daughter	was	born	in	singapore	,	now	the	 health 	 iest 	 	country	on	 th 	 is 	 	earth	.
it	 bypass 	 ed 	 	sweden	about	two	to	three	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	with	better	child	 surviv 	 al 	 	.
but	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	small	,	you	know	?
they	're	so	close	to	the	hospital	we	can	never	beat	them	out	in	these	 forest 	 s 	 	.
but	 hom 	 age 	 	to	singapore	.
singapore	is	the	best	one	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	 look 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	like	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	story	.
but	it	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	that	easy	,	that	it	's	all	a	good	story	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	have	to	show	you	one	of	the	other	 facil 	 ities 	 	.
we	can	 al 	 so 	 	make	the	color	here	represent	the	 vari 	 able 	 	--	and	what	am	i	 choos 	 ing 	 	here	?
carbon	-	 di 	 oxide 	 	 e 	 mission 	 	,	metric	ton	per	capita	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	1962	,	and	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	was	 emit 	 ting 	 	16	 ton 	 s 	 	per	person	.
and	 chin 	 a 	 	was	 emit 	 ting 	 	0.6	,	and	india	was	 emit 	 ting 	 	0.32	 ton 	 s 	 	per	capita	.
and	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	we	 move 	 d 	 	on	?
well	,	you	see	the	nice	story	of	 get 	 ting 	 	 rich 	 er 	 	and	 get 	 ting 	 	 health 	 ier 	 	--
 every 	 one 	 	did	it	at	the	cost	of	 e 	 mission 	 	of	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	.
there	is	no	one	who	 ha 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	it	so	far	.
and	we	do	n't	have	all	the	 update 	 d 	 	data	any	 long 	 er 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	hot	data	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	there	we	are	,	2001	.
and	in	the	 discuss 	 ion 	 	i	 attend 	 ed 	 	with	global	 lead 	 ers 	 	,	you	know	,	 man 	 y 	 	say	now	the	problem	is	that	the	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	,	they	are	 get 	 ting 	 	out	too	much	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	.
the	 mini 	 ster 	 	of	the	environment	of	india	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	you	 we 	 re 	 	the	one	who	 caus 	 ed 	 	the	problem	.	``
the	oecd	 count 	 ries 	 	--	the	high	-	income	 count 	 ries 	 	--	they	 we 	 re 	 	the	 one 	 s 	 	who	 caus 	 ed 	 	the	climate	change	.
``	but	we	forgive	you	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	did	n't	know	it	.
but	from	now	on	,	we	count	per	capita	.
from	now	on	we	count	per	capita	.
and	 every 	 one 	 	is	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	the	per	capita	 e 	 mission 	 	.	``	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 show 	 s 	 	you	,	we	have	not	 s 	 een 	 	good	economic	and	health	progress	 any 	 where 	 	in	the	world	 with 	 out 	 	 destroy 	 ing 	 	the	climate	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	what	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 change 	 d 	 	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 critic 	 ized 	 	for	 show 	 ing 	 	you	a	too	positive	image	of	the	world	,	but	i	do	n't	think	it	's	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
the	world	is	 quit 	 e 	 	a	 mess 	 y 	 	place	.
 th 	 is 	 	we	can	call	dollar	street	.
 every 	 one 	 	 live 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	street	here	.
what	they	earn	here	--	what	number	they	live	on	--	is	how	much	they	earn	per	day	.
 th 	 is 	 	family	 earn 	 s 	 	about	one	dollar	per	day	.
we	drive	up	the	street	here	,	we	find	a	family	here	which	 earn 	 s 	 	about	two	to	three	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	day	.
and	we	drive	away	here	--	we	find	the	first	garden	in	the	street	,	and	they	earn	10	to	50	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	day	.
and	how	do	they	live	?
if	we	look	at	the	bed	here	,	we	can	see	that	they	sleep	on	a	rug	on	the	floor	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	poverty	line	is	--	80	percent	of	the	family	income	is	just	to	cover	the	energy	 need 	 s 	 	,	the	food	for	the	day	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	two	to	five	 dollar 	 s 	 	.	you	have	a	bed	.
and	here	it	's	a	much	 nic 	 er 	 	 bed 	 room 	 	,	you	can	see	.
i	 lectur 	 ed 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	for	ikea	,	and	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	see	the	 s 	 of 	 a 	 	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	here	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 s 	 of 	 a 	 	,	how	it	will	emerge	from	there	.
and	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	,	when	you	go	around	here	in	the	photo	 pan 	 or 	 ama 	 	,	you	see	the	family	still	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	on	the	floor	there	.	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	there	is	a	 s 	 of 	 a 	 	,
if	you	watch	in	the	kitchen	,	you	can	see	that	the	great	 differ 	 ence 	 	for	women	 do 	 es 	 	not	come	between	one	to	10	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
it	 come 	 s 	 	beyond	here	,	when	you	 re 	 ally 	 	can	get	good	 work 	 ing 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	in	the	family	.
and	if	you	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	see	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	,	you	look	at	the	toilet	over	here	.
 th 	 is 	 	can	change	.	 th 	 is 	 	can	change	.
these	are	all	 picture 	 s 	 	and	 image 	 s 	 	from	africa	,	and	it	can	 be 	 come 	 	much	better	.
we	can	get	out	of	poverty	.
my	own	research	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 be 	 en 	 	in	it	or	 any 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	 s 	 pent 	 	20	 year 	 s 	 	in	 interview 	 s 	 	with	african	 farm 	 ers 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	on	the	 ver 	 ge 	 	of	famine	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	result	of	the	 farm 	 ers 	 	-	 need 	 s 	 	research	.
the	nice	thing	here	is	that	you	ca	n't	see	who	are	the	 research 	 ers 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	picture	.
that	's	when	research	 function 	 s 	 	in	poor	 socie 	 ties 	 	--	you	must	 re 	 ally 	 	live	with	the	people	.
when	you	're	in	poverty	,	 every 	 thing 	 	is	about	 surviv 	 al 	 	.
it	's	about	 hav 	 ing 	 	food	.
and	these	two	young	 farm 	 ers 	 	,	they	are	 girl 	 s 	 	now	--	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 parent 	 s 	 	are	dead	from	hiv	and	 aid 	 s 	 	--	they	discuss	with	a	trained	 agr 	 onomist 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	best	 agr 	 onomist 	 s 	 	in	malawi	,	junatambe	kumbira	,	and	he	's	 discuss 	 ing 	 	what	sort	of	 cass 	 a 	 va 	 	they	will	plant	--	the	best	 convert 	 er 	 	of	 s 	 un 	 shine 	 	to	food	that	man	 ha 	 s 	 	found	.
and	they	are	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 eager 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	to	get	 ad 	 vice 	 	,	and	that	's	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	in	poverty	.
that	's	one	 con 	 text 	 	.
 get 	 ting 	 	out	of	poverty	.
the	women	told	us	one	thing	.	``	get	us	technology	.
we	hate	 th 	 is 	 	 mort 	 ar 	 	,	to	stand	 hour 	 s 	 	and	 hour 	 s 	 	.
get	us	a	mill	so	that	we	can	mill	our	flour	,	then	we	will	be	able	to	pay	for	the	rest	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.	``	technology	will	 br 	 ing 	 	you	out	of	poverty	,	but	there	's	a	need	for	a	market	to	get	away	from	poverty	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	woman	is	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	now	,	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	her	 product 	 s 	 	to	the	market	.
but	she	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 thank 	 ful 	 	for	the	public	 invest 	 ment 	 	in	 school 	 ing 	 	so	she	can	count	,	and	wo	n't	be	 cheat 	 ed 	 	when	she	 reach 	 es 	 	the	market	.

you	can	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	find	my	experience	from	20	 year 	 s 	 	of	africa	is	that	the	 seem 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	is	possible	.
africa	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 d 	 one 	 	bad	.
in	50	 year 	 s 	 	they	've	gone	from	a	pre	-	 med 	 ieval 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	to	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 de 	 cent 	 	100	-	year	-	ago	europe	,	with	a	 function 	 ing 	 	nation	and	state	.
i	would	say	that	sub	-	saharan	africa	 ha 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	best	in	the	world	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	last	50	 year 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	do	n't	consider	where	they	came	from	.
it	's	 th 	 is 	 	stupid	 con 	 cept 	 	of	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	that	 put 	 s 	 	us	,	argentina	and	mozambique	together	50	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	 say 	 s 	 	that	mozambique	did	 wo 	 rse 	 	.
we	have	to	know	a	little	more	about	the	world	.
i	have	a	neighbor	who	 know 	 s 	 	200	 type 	 s 	 	of	wine	.
he	 know 	 s 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	.
he	 know 	 s 	 	the	name	of	the	grape	,	the	temperature	and	 every 	 thing 	 	.
i	 on 	 ly 	 	know	two	 type 	 s 	 	of	wine	--	red	and	white	.
but	my	neighbor	 on 	 ly 	 	 know 	 s 	 	two	 type 	 s 	 	of	 count 	 ries 	 	--	 industrial 	 ized 	 	and	 develop 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	know	200	,	i	know	about	the	small	data	.
but	you	can	do	that	.
but	i	have	to	get	serious	.	and	how	do	you	get	serious	?
you	make	a	powerpoint	,	you	know	?
 hom 	 age 	 	to	the	 off 	 ice 	 	package	,	no	?
what	is	 th 	 is 	 	,	what	is	 th 	 is 	 	,	what	am	i	 tell 	 ing 	 	?
i	'm	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	that	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 dimension 	 s 	 	of	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
 every 	 one 	 	 want 	 s 	 	your	pet	thing	.
if	you	are	in	the	corporate	sector	,	you	love	micro	-	credit	.
if	you	are	 fight 	 ing 	 	in	a	non	-	 government 	 al 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	,	you	love	 equ 	 ity 	 	between	gender	.
or	if	you	are	a	teacher	,	you	'll	love	unesco	,	and	so	on	.
on	the	global	level	,	we	have	to	have	more	than	our	own	thing	.
we	need	 every 	 thing 	 	.
all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 import 	 ant 	 	for	 develop 	 ment 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	when	you	just	get	out	of	poverty	and	you	should	go	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 wel 	 fare 	 	.
now	,	what	we	need	to	think	about	is	,	what	is	a	goal	for	 develop 	 ment 	 	,	and	what	are	the	 mean 	 s 	 	for	 develop 	 ment 	 	?
let	me	first	grade	what	are	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	.
economic	growth	to	me	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	public	-	health	professor	,	is	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	for	 develop 	 ment 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 explain 	 s 	 	80	percent	of	 surviv 	 al 	 	.
 govern 	 ance 	 	.	to	have	a	government	which	 function 	 s 	 	--	that	's	what	 br 	 ought 	 	california	out	of	the	 mis 	 ery 	 	of	1850	.
it	was	the	government	that	made	law	function	 final 	 ly 	 	.
education	,	human	 resource 	 s 	 	are	 import 	 ant 	 	.
health	is	 al 	 so 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	but	not	that	much	 a 	 s 	 	a	mean	.
environment	is	 import 	 ant 	 	.
human	 right 	 s 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	but	it	just	 get 	 s 	 	one	cross	.
now	what	about	 goal 	 s 	 	?	where	are	we	going	 to 	 ward 	 	?
we	are	not	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	money	.
money	is	not	a	goal	.
it	's	the	best	mean	,	but	i	give	it	zero	 a 	 s 	 	a	goal	.
 govern 	 ance 	 	,	well	it	's	 f 	 un 	 	to	vote	in	a	little	thing	,	but	it	's	not	a	goal	.
and	going	to	school	,	that	's	not	a	goal	,	it	's	a	mean	.
health	i	give	two	 point 	 s 	 	.	i	mean	it	's	nice	to	be	 health 	 y 	 	--	at	my	age	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	--	you	can	stand	here	,	you	're	 health 	 y 	 	.
and	that	's	good	,	it	 get 	 s 	 	two	 plus 	 s 	 es 	 	.
environment	is	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 cruci 	 al 	 	.
there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	for	the	 grand 	 kid 	 	if	you	do	n't	 s 	 ave 	 	up	.
but	where	are	the	 import 	 ant 	 	 goal 	 s 	 	?
of	course	,	it	's	human	 right 	 s 	 	.
human	 right 	 s 	 	is	the	goal	,	but	it	's	not	that	strong	of	a	mean	for	 achiev 	 ing 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
and	culture	.	culture	is	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	,	i	would	say	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	what	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	joy	to	life	.
that	's	the	value	of	living	.
so	the	 seem 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	is	possible	.
even	african	 count 	 ries 	 	can	 achiev 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	i	've	 show 	 n 	 	you	the	shot	where	the	 seem 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	is	possible	.
and	remember	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	remember	my	main	 mess 	 age 	 	,	which	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	the	 seem 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	is	possible	.
we	can	have	a	good	world	.
i	 show 	 ed 	 	you	the	 shot 	 s 	 	,	i	 prov 	 ed 	 	it	in	the	powerpoint	,	and	i	think	i	will	 con 	 vince 	 	you	 al 	 so 	 	by	culture	.
 br 	 ing 	 	me	my	 s 	 word 	 	!
 s 	 word 	 	 swallow 	 ing 	 	is	from	ancient	india	.
it	's	a	cultural	 express 	 ion 	 	that	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	inspired	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	to	think	beyond	the	obvious	.
and	i	will	now	prove	to	you	that	the	 seem 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	is	possible	by	taking	 th 	 is 	 	piece	of	steel	--	solid	steel	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 arm 	 y 	 	bayonet	from	the	swedish	 arm 	 y 	 	,	1850	,	in	the	last	year	we	had	war	.
and	it	's	all	solid	steel	--	you	can	hear	here	.
and	i	'm	going	to	take	 th 	 is 	 	blade	of	steel	,	and	push	it	down	through	my	body	of	blood	and	 fl 	 esh 	 	,	and	prove	to	you	that	the	 seem 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	is	possible	.
can	i	request	a	moment	of	absolute	silence	?
