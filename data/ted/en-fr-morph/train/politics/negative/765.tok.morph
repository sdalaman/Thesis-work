my	name	's	jamie	oliver	.	i	'm	34	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
i	'm	from	essex	in	england	and	for	the	last	seven	 year 	 s 	 	i	've	 work 	 ed 	 	 fair 	 ly 	 	 tire 	 lessly 	 	to	 s 	 ave 	 	 live 	 s 	 	in	my	own	way	.
i	'm	not	a	doctor	;
i	'm	a	chef	,	i	do	n't	have	expensive	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	or	medicine	.
i	use	information	,	education	.
i	 pro 	 found 	 ly 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	the	power	of	food	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 prim 	 al 	 	place	in	our	 home 	 s 	 	that	 bind 	 s 	 	us	to	the	best	bits	of	life	.
we	have	an	awful	,	awful	 re 	 ality 	 	right	now	.
america	,	you	're	at	the	top	of	your	game	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	most	 un 	 health 	 y 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	in	the	world	.
can	i	 pleas 	 e 	 	just	see	a	raise	of	 hand 	 s 	 	for	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	have	children	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	 to 	 day 	 	?

most	of	you	.	ok	.
we	,	the	 adult 	 s 	 	of	the	last	four	 generation 	 s 	 	,	have	 bless 	 ed 	 	our	children	with	the	 de 	 s 	 tin 	 y 	 	of	a	 short 	 er 	 	 life 	 span 	 	than	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 parent 	 s 	 	.

two	-	 third 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	 to 	 day 	 	,	in	america	,	are	 statistic 	 ally 	 	 over 	 weight 	 	or	 obes 	 e 	 	.
you	lot	,	you	're	all	right	,	but	we	'll	get	you	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	do	n't	worry	.
right	?
the	 statistic 	 s 	 	of	bad	health	are	clear	,	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	.
we	 s 	 pend 	 	our	 live 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 para 	 n 	 oid 	 	about	death	,	murder	,	 hom 	 icide 	 	,	you	name	it	;	it	's	on	the	front	page	of	every	paper	,	cnn	.
look	at	 hom 	 icide 	 	at	the	bottom	,	for	god	's	sake	.
right	?
every	single	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	in	the	red	is	a	diet	-	related	disease	.
any	doctor	,	any	 special 	 ist 	 	will	tell	you	that	.
fact	:	diet	-	related	disease	is	the	 big 	 gest 	 	killer	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	right	now	,	here	 to 	 day 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	global	problem	.
it	's	a	 catastroph 	 e 	 	.
it	's	 s 	 weep 	 ing 	 	the	world	.
england	is	right	 be 	 hind 	 	you	,	 a 	 s 	 	usual	.
i	know	they	 we 	 re 	 	close	,	but	not	that	close	.
we	need	a	revolution	.
mexico	,	australia	,	germany	,	india	,	 chin 	 a 	 	,	all	have	massive	 problem 	 s 	 	of	 obes 	 ity 	 	and	bad	health	.
think	about	 smok 	 ing 	 	.
it	 cost 	 s 	 	way	less	than	 obes 	 ity 	 	now	.
 obes 	 ity 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	you	americans	10	percent	of	your	 health 	 care 	 	 bill 	 s 	 	,
150	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	.
in	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	it	's	set	to	double	:
300	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	.
and	let	's	be	honest	,	 guy 	 s 	 	,	you	ai	n't	got	that	cash	.
i	came	here	to	start	a	food	revolution	that	i	so	 pro 	 found 	 ly 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	in	.
we	need	it	.	the	time	is	now	.
we	're	in	a	 tip 	 ping 	 	-	point	moment	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	for	seven	 year 	 s 	 	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	in	america	for	seven	 year 	 s 	 	.
now	is	the	time	when	it	's	 rip 	 e 	 	--	 rip 	 e 	 	for	the	 pick 	 ing 	 	.
i	went	to	the	eye	of	the	storm	.
i	went	to	west	virginia	,	the	most	 un 	 health 	 y 	 	state	in	america	.
or	it	was	last	year	.

i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	put	heart	and	soul	and	people	,	your	public	,	around	the	 statistic 	 s 	 	that	we	've	 be 	 come 	 	so	used	to	.
i	want	to	 introduc 	 e 	 	you	to	some	of	the	people	that	i	care	about	:
your	public	,	your	children	.
i	want	to	show	a	picture	of	my	friend	brittany	.
she	's	16	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
she	's	got	six	 year 	 s 	 	to	live	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	food	that	she	's	eaten	.
she	's	the	third	generation	of	americans	that	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	grown	up	 with 	 in 	 	a	food	environment	where	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	taught	to	cook	at	home	or	in	school	,	or	her	mom	,	or	her	mom	's	mom	.
she	 ha 	 s 	 	six	 year 	 s 	 	to	live	.
she	's	eating	her	liver	to	death	.
stacy	,	the	edwards	family	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	normal	family	,	 guy 	 s 	 	.
stacy	 do 	 es 	 	her	best	,	but	she	's	third	-	generation	 a 	 s 	 	well	;	she	was	never	taught	to	cook	at	home	or	in	school	.
the	family	's	 obes 	 e 	 	.
justin	here	,	12	 year 	 s 	 	old	,
he	's	350	 pound 	 s 	 	.
he	 get 	 s 	 	 bull 	 ied 	 	,	for	god	's	sake	.
the	daughter	there	,	katie	,	she	's	four	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
she	's	 obes 	 e 	 	before	she	even	 get 	 s 	 	to	 prim 	 ary 	 	school	.

but	you	know	what	?	her	father	,	who	was	 obes 	 e 	 	,	 di 	 ed 	 	in	her	 arm 	 s 	 	,
and	then	the	second	most	 import 	 ant 	 	man	in	her	life	,	her	uncle	,	 di 	 ed 	 	of	 obes 	 ity 	 	,
and	now	her	step	-	dad	is	 obes 	 e 	 	.
you	see	,	the	thing	is	 obes 	 ity 	 	and	diet	-	related	disease	 do 	 es 	 	n't	just	hurt	the	people	that	have	it	;	it	's	all	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	,	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	,	 brother 	 s 	 	,	 sister 	 s 	 	.
pastor	steve	:
an	 inspiration 	 al 	 	man	,	one	of	my	early	 al 	 lies 	 	in	huntington	,	west	virginia	.
he	's	at	the	sharp	knife	-	edge	of	 th 	 is 	 	problem	.
he	 ha 	 s 	 	to	bury	the	people	,	ok	?
and	he	's	fed	up	with	it	.	he	's	fed	up	with	 bury 	 ing 	 	his	 friend 	 s 	 	,	his	family	,	his	community	.
come	winter	,	three	 time 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	die	.
he	's	sick	of	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 prevent 	 able 	 	disease	.	waste	of	life	.
by	the	way	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	they	get	buried	in	.
we	're	not	 gear 	 ed 	 	up	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
ca	n't	even	get	them	out	the	door	--	and	i	'm	 be 	 ing 	 	serious	--
ca	n't	even	get	them	there	.	forklift	.
ok	,	i	see	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	triangle	,	ok	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	our	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	of	food	.
i	need	you	to	understand	it	.
you	've	 prob 	 ably 	 	heard	all	 th 	 is 	 	before	,	but	let	's	just	go	back	over	it	.
over	the	last	30	 year 	 s 	 	,	what	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	that	's	 rip 	 ped 	 	the	heart	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	country	?
let	's	be	frank	and	honest	:
well	,	modern	-	day	life	.
let	's	start	with	the	main	street	.	fast	food	 ha 	 s 	 	taken	over	the	whole	country	;	we	know	that	.
the	big	 brand 	 s 	 	are	some	of	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 power 	 s 	 	,	 power 	 ful 	 	 power 	 s 	 	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	.
 super 	 market 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
big	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.	big	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.
thirty	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	most	of	the	food	was	 large 	 ly 	 	local	and	 large 	 ly 	 	fresh	.
now	it	's	 large 	 ly 	 	 process 	 ed 	 	and	full	of	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 additive 	 s 	 	,	extra	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	,	and	you	know	the	rest	of	the	story	.
 port 	 ion 	 	 s 	 ize 	 	is	 obvious 	 ly 	 	a	massive	,	massive	problem	.
 label 	 ing 	 	is	a	massive	problem	.
the	 label 	 ing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	is	a	 dis 	 grace 	 	.
they	want	to	be	self	--	they	want	to	self	-	police	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
the	industry	 want 	 s 	 	to	self	-	police	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
what	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	climate	?	they	do	n't	deserve	it	.
how	can	you	say	 some 	 thing 	 	is	low	-	fat	when	it	's	full	of	so	much	sugar	?
home	.	the	 big 	 gest 	 	problem	with	the	home	is	that	used	to	be	the	heart	of	 pass 	 ing 	 	on	food	,	food	culture	,
what	made	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
that	ai	n't	 happen 	 ing 	 	 any 	 more 	 	.
and	you	know	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	go	to	work	and	 a 	 s 	 	life	 change 	 s 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	life	 al 	 ways 	 	 evolve 	 s 	 	,	we	kind	of	have	to	look	at	it	 hol 	 istically 	 	--	step	back	for	a	moment	,	and	re	-	address	the	balance	.
it	ai	n't	 happen 	 ing 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 happen 	 ed 	 	for	30	 year 	 s 	 	,	ok	?
i	want	to	show	you	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	that	is	 ver 	 y 	 	normal	right	now	;	the	edwards	family	.
jamie	oliver	:	let	's	have	a	talk	.
 th 	 is 	 	stuff	 go 	 es 	 	through	you	and	your	family	's	body	every	week	.
and	i	need	you	to	know	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	kill	your	children	early	.
how	are	you	 feel 	 ing 	 	?
stacy	:	just	 feel 	 ing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 ad 	 	and	 depress 	 ed 	 	right	now	.
but	,	you	know	,	i	want	my	 kid 	 s 	 	to	succeed	in	life	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	going	to	get	them	there	.
but	i	'm	 kill 	 ing 	 	them	.
jo	:	 y 	 es 	 	you	are	.	you	are	.
but	we	can	stop	that	.
normal	.	let	's	get	on	 school 	 s 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	'm	 fair 	 ly 	 	much	a	 special 	 ist 	 	in	.
ok	,	school	.
what	is	school	?	who	 invent 	 ed 	 	it	?	what	's	the	purpose	of	school	?
school	was	 al 	 ways 	 	 invent 	 ed 	 	to	arm	us	with	the	 tool 	 s 	 	to	make	us	creative	,	do	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	make	us	earn	a	living	,	etc	.	,	etc	.	,	etc	.
you	know	,	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	kind	of	in	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	tight	box	for	a	long	,	long	time	.
ok	?
but	we	have	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	it	to	deal	with	the	health	 catastroph 	 es 	 	of	america	,	ok	?
school	food	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	most	 kid 	 s 	 	--	31	million	a	day	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	have	twice	a	day	,	more	than	often	,	 break 	 fast 	 	and	lunch	,	180	 day 	 s 	 	of	the	year	.
so	you	could	say	that	school	food	is	 quit 	 e 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 judg 	 ing 	 	the	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	.
before	i	crack	 in 	 to 	 	my	rant	,	which	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	you	're	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	...	i	need	to	say	one	thing	,	and	it	's	so	 import 	 ant 	 	in	 hope 	 fully 	 	the	magic	that	 happen 	 s 	 	and	 un 	 fold 	 s 	 	in	the	next	three	 month 	 s 	 	.
the	lunch	 lad 	 ies 	 	,	the	lunch	 cook 	 s 	 	of	america	--	i	 off 	 er 	 	 my 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	ambassador	.
i	'm	not	 s 	 lack 	 ing 	 	them	off	.
they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	the	best	they	can	do	.
they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	best	.
but	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	what	they	're	told	,	and	what	they	're	 be 	 ing 	 	told	to	do	is	wrong	.
the	system	is	 high 	 ly 	 	run	by	 account 	 ants 	 	;
there	's	not	 en 	 ough 	 	,	or	any	,	food	-	 knowledge 	 able 	 	people	in	the	business	.
there	's	a	problem	:
if	you	're	not	a	food	expert	,	and	you	've	got	tight	 budget 	 s 	 	and	it	's	 get 	 ting 	 	 tight 	 er 	 	,	then	you	ca	n't	be	creative	,	you	ca	n't	duck	and	 d 	 ive 	 	and	write	different	 thing 	 s 	 	around	 thing 	 s 	 	.
if	you	're	an	 account 	 ant 	 	,	and	a	box	-	 tick 	 er 	 	,	the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	you	can	do	in	these	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	is	buy	 cheap 	 er 	 	shit	.
now	,	the	 re 	 ality 	 	is	,	the	food	that	your	 kid 	 s 	 	get	every	day	is	fast	food	,	it	's	 high 	 ly 	 	 process 	 ed 	 	,	there	's	not	 en 	 ough 	 	fresh	food	in	there	at	all	.
you	know	,	the	amount	of	 additive 	 s 	 	,	e	 number 	 s 	 	,	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	you	would	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	--	there	's	not	 en 	 ough 	 	 veggie 	 s 	 	at	all	.	french	 f 	 ries 	 	are	 consider 	 ed 	 	a	 veget 	 able 	 	.
pizza	for	 break 	 fast 	 	.	they	do	n't	even	get	 give 	 n 	 	 croc 	 ker 	 y 	 	.
knives	and	 for 	 k 	 s 	 	?	no	,	they	're	too	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
they	have	 s 	 cis 	 s 	 ors 	 	in	the	 class 	 room 	 	,	but	knives	and	 for 	 k 	 s 	 	?	no	.
and	the	way	i	look	at	it	is	:	if	you	do	n't	have	knives	and	 for 	 k 	 s 	 	in	your	school	,	you	're	 pur 	 e 	 ly 	 	 end 	 ors 	 ing 	 	,	from	a	state	level	,	fast	food	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 hand 	 held 	 	.
and	 y 	 es 	 	,	by	the	way	,	it	is	fast	food	:	it	's	 slop 	 py 	 	 jo 	 es 	 	,	it	's	 burger 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 wi 	 en 	 ers 	 	,	it	's	 pizza 	 s 	 	,	it	's	all	of	that	stuff	.
ten	percent	of	what	we	 s 	 pend 	 	on	 health 	 care 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	,	is	on	 obes 	 ity 	 	,	and	it	's	going	to	double	.
we	're	not	 teach 	 ing 	 	our	 kid 	 s 	 	.
there	's	no	 s 	 ta 	 tutor 	 y 	 	right	to	teach	 kid 	 s 	 	about	food	,	 element 	 ary 	 	or	 second 	 ary 	 	school	.	ok	?
we	do	n't	teach	 kid 	 s 	 	about	food	.	right	?
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	little	clip	from	an	 element 	 ary 	 	school	,	which	is	 ver 	 y 	 	common	in	england	.

and	most	 kid 	 s 	 	do	.
but	milk	ai	n't	good	 en 	 ough 	 	 any 	 more 	 	.	 be 	 cause 	 	 some 	 one 	 	at	the	milk	board	,	right	--	and	do	n't	get	me	wrong	,	i	support	milk	--	but	 some 	 one 	 	at	the	milk	board	 prob 	 ably 	 	paid	a	lot	of	money	for	some	 geez 	 er 	 	to	work	out	that	if	you	put	 load 	 s 	 	of	 flavor 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	 color 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	sugar	in	milk	,	right	,	more	 kid 	 s 	 	will	drink	it	.	 yea 	 h 	 	.

it	's	in	 every 	 thing 	 	.	even	the	milk	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 es 	 cap 	 ed 	 	the	kind	of	modern	-	day	 problem 	 s 	 	.
there	's	our	milk	.	there	's	our	 car 	 ton 	 	.
in	that	is	 near 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	sugar	 a 	 s 	 	one	of	your	 favor 	 ite 	 	 can 	 s 	 	of	 fizz 	 y 	 	pop	,
and	they	are	 hav 	 ing 	 	two	a	day	.
so	,	let	me	just	show	you	.
we	've	got	one	kid	,	here	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	,	you	know	,	eight	 table 	 spoon 	 s 	 	of	sugar	a	day	.
you	know	,	there	's	your	week	.
there	's	your	month	.
and	i	've	taken	the	 liber 	 ty 	 	of	 put 	 ting 	 	in	just	the	five	 year 	 s 	 	of	 element 	 ary 	 	school	sugar	,	just	from	milk	.
now	,	i	do	n't	know	about	you	 guy 	 s 	 	,	but	 judg 	 ing 	 	the	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	,	right	,	any	 judg 	 e 	 	in	the	whole	world	,	would	look	at	the	 statistic 	 s 	 	and	the	evidence	,	and	they	would	find	any	government	of	old	 guilt 	 y 	 	of	child	abuse	.	that	's	my	belief	.
now	,	if	i	came	up	here	,	and	i	wish	i	could	come	up	here	 to 	 day 	 	and	hang	a	cure	for	 aid 	 s 	 	or	cancer	,	you	'd	be	 fight 	 ing 	 	and	 s 	 cram 	 bling 	 	to	get	to	me	.
 th 	 is 	 	,	all	 th 	 is 	 	bad	news	,	is	 prevent 	 able 	 	.
that	's	the	good	news	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 prevent 	 able 	 	.
so	,	let	's	just	think	about	,	we	got	a	problem	here	,	we	need	to	 re 	 boot 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	so	,	in	my	world	,	what	do	we	need	to	do	?
here	is	the	thing	,	right	,
it	can	not	just	come	from	one	source	.
to	 re 	 boot 	 	and	make	real	tangible	change	,	real	change	,	so	that	i	could	look	you	in	the	white	of	the	 eye 	 s 	 	and	say	,	``	in	10	 year 	 s 	 	time	,	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	your	children	's	 live 	 s 	 	,	happiness	--	and	let	's	not	forget	,	you	're	clever	if	you	eat	well	,	you	know	you	're	going	to	live	 long 	 er 	 	--	all	of	that	stuff	,	it	will	look	different	.	ok	?	``	so	,	 super 	 market 	 s 	 	.
where	else	do	you	shop	so	 religious 	 ly 	 	?	week	in	,	week	out	.
how	much	money	do	you	 s 	 pend 	 	,	in	your	life	,	in	a	 super 	 market 	 	?
love	them	.	they	just	sell	us	what	we	want	.	all	right	.
they	owe	us	,	to	put	a	food	ambassador	in	every	major	 super 	 market 	 	.
they	need	to	help	us	shop	.	they	need	to	show	us	how	to	cook	quick	,	tasty	,	 season 	 al 	 	 meal 	 s 	 	for	people	that	are	 bus 	 y 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	expensive	.
it	is	 d 	 one 	 	in	some	,	and	it	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 d 	 one 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	board	in	america	soon	,	and	quick	.
the	big	 brand 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	the	food	 brand 	 s 	 	,	need	to	put	food	education	at	the	heart	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 business 	 es 	 	.
i	know	,	 eas 	 ier 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	than	 d 	 one 	 	.
it	's	the	future	.	it	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	.
fast	food	.	with	the	fast	-	food	industry	you	know	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	competitive	.
i	've	had	 load 	 s 	 	of	secret	 paper 	 s 	 	and	 deal 	 ing 	 s 	 	with	fast	food	 restaurant 	 s 	 	.
i	know	how	they	do	it	.
i	mean	 bas 	 ically 	 	they	've	 wean 	 ed 	 	us	on	to	these	 hit 	 s 	 	of	sugar	,	salt	and	fat	,	and	x	,	y	,	and	z	,
and	 every 	 one 	 	 love 	 s 	 	them	.	right	?
so	,	these	 guy 	 s 	 	are	going	to	be	part	of	the	solution	.
but	we	need	to	get	the	government	to	work	with	all	of	the	fast	food	 pur 	 vey 	 ors 	 	and	the	restaurant	industry	,
and	over	a	five	,	six	,	seven	year	period	wean	of	us	off	the	 extrem 	 e 	 	 amount 	 s 	 	of	fat	,	sugar	,	fat	and	all	the	other	non	-	food	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	.
now	,	 al 	 so 	 	,	back	to	the	sort	of	big	 brand 	 s 	 	:	 label 	 ing 	 	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	,	is	an	absolute	 far 	 ce 	 
and	 ha 	 s 	 	got	to	be	 sort 	 ed 	 	.
ok	,	school	.
 obvious 	 ly 	 	in	 school 	 s 	 	we	owe	it	to	them	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	180	 day 	 s 	 	of	the	year	,	from	that	little	precious	age	of	four	,	til	18	,	20	,	24	,	 what 	 ever 	 	,	they	need	to	be	 cook 	 ed 	 	proper	,	fresh	food	from	local	 grow 	 ers 	 	on	 s 	 ite 	 	.	ok	?
there	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	a	new	standard	of	fresh	,	proper	food	for	your	children	.	 yea 	 h 	 	?
under	the	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 pro 	 found 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	that	every	single	american	child	 leav 	 es 	 	school	 know 	 ing 	 	how	to	cook	10	 recipe 	 s 	 	that	will	 s 	 ave 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	life	.
life	 skill 	 s 	 	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	they	can	be	 student 	 s 	 	,	young	 parent 	 s 	 	,	and	be	able	to	sort	of	duck	and	 d 	 ive 	 	around	the	 bas 	 ic 	 s 	 	of	 cook 	 ing 	 	,	no	matter	what	 recess 	 ion 	 	 hit 	 s 	 	them	next	time	.	if	you	can	cook	,	 recess 	 ion 	 	money	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	.
if	you	can	cook	,	time	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	.
the	 work 	 place 	 	,	we	have	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	it	.
you	know	,	it	's	now	time	for	corporate	 respons 	 ibility 	 	to	 re 	 ally 	 	look	at	what	they	feed	or	make	 avail 	 able 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	staff	.
the	staff	are	the	 mom 	 s 	 	and	 dad 	 s 	 	of	america	's	children	.
marissa	,	her	father	 di 	 ed 	 	in	her	hand	,	i	think	she	'd	be	 quit 	 e 	 	happy	if	corporate	america	could	start	 feed 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	staff	 proper 	 ly 	 	.
 definite 	 ly 	 	they	should	n't	be	left	out	.
let	's	go	back	to	the	home	.
now	,	look	,	if	we	do	all	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	,	and	we	can	,	it	's	so	 achiev 	 able 	 	.	you	can	care	and	be	commercial	.
 absolute 	 ly 	 	.
but	the	home	 need 	 s 	 	to	start	 pass 	 ing 	 	on	 cook 	 ing 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	,	for	 s 	 ure 	 	.
for	 s 	 ure 	 	,	pass	it	on	 a 	 s 	 	a	 philosoph 	 y 	 	.
and	for	me	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	romantic	,	but	it	's	about	if	one	person	 teach 	 es 	 	three	people	how	to	cook	 some 	 thing 	 	,	and	they	teach	three	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 mate 	 s 	 	,	that	 on 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	repeat	 it 	 self 	 	25	 time 	 s 	 	,	and	that	's	the	whole	population	of	america	.
romantic	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	but	most	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	about	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	people	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	every	one	of	your	individual	 effort 	 s 	 	 make 	 s 	 	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
we	've	got	to	put	back	what	's	 be 	 en 	 	lost	.
huntington	kitchen	.	huntington	,	where	i	made	 th 	 is 	 	program	,	you	know	,	we	've	got	 th 	 is 	 	prime	-	time	program	that	 hope 	 fully 	 	will	inspire	people	to	 re 	 ally 	 	get	on	 th 	 is 	 	change	.
i	 tru 	 ly 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	change	will	happen	.
huntington	's	kitchen	.	i	work	with	a	community	.
i	 work 	 ed 	 	in	the	 school 	 s 	 	.	i	found	local	 sustain 	 able 	 	 fund 	 ing 	 	to	get	every	single	school	in	the	area	,	from	the	junk	,	onto	the	fresh	food	:
six	-	and	-	a	-	half	grand	per	school	.
that	's	all	it	 take 	 s 	 	,	six	-	and	-	a	-	half	grand	per	school	.
the	kitchen	is	25	grand	a	month	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	can	do	5,000	people	a	year	,	which	is	10	percent	of	 the 	 ir 	 	population	,
and	it	's	people	on	people	.
you	know	,	it	's	local	 cook 	 s 	 	 teach 	 ing 	 	local	people	.
it	's	free	 cook 	 ing 	 	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	,	 guy 	 s 	 	,	free	 cook 	 ing 	 	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	in	the	main	street	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	real	,	tangible	change	,	real	,	tangible	change	.
around	america	,	if	we	just	look	back	now	,	there	is	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	going	on	.
there	is	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	going	on	.	there	are	 angel 	 s 	 	around	america	 do 	 ing 	 	great	 thing 	 s 	 	in	 school 	 s 	 	--	farm	-	to	-	school	set	-	 up 	 s 	 	,	garden	set	-	 up 	 s 	 	,	education	--
there	are	 amaz 	 ing 	 	people	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	.
the	problem	is	they	all	want	to	roll	out	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	to	the	next	school	,	and	the	next	,
but	there	's	no	cash	.
we	need	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	the	 expert 	 s 	 	and	the	 angel 	 s 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	identify	them	,	and	allow	them	to	 eas 	 ily 	 	find	the	resource	to	keep	 roll 	 ing 	 	out	what	they	're	 al 	 ready 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	,	and	 do 	 ing 	 	well	.
 business 	 es 	 	of	america	need	to	support	mrs.	obama	to	do	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	she	 want 	 s 	 	to	do	.
and	look	,	i	know	it	's	weird	 hav 	 ing 	 	an	english	person	 stand 	 ing 	 	here	before	you	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	all	 th 	 is 	 	.
all	i	can	say	is	:	i	care	.	i	'm	a	father	,
and	i	love	 th 	 is 	 	country	,
and	i	 believ 	 e 	 	 tru 	 ly 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	that	if	change	can	be	made	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	,	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	will	happen	around	the	world	.	if	america	 do 	 es 	 	it	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	other	people	will	follow	.
it	's	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
when	i	was	in	huntington	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	a	few	 thing 	 s 	 	to	work	when	they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	,	i	thought	``	if	i	had	a	magic	 wan 	 d 	 	,	what	would	i	do	?	``	and	i	thought	,	``	you	know	what	?
i	'd	just	love	to	be	put	in	front	of	some	of	the	most	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 move 	 rs 	 	and	 shake 	 rs 	 	in	america	.	``
and	a	month	 lat 	 er 	 	,	ted	 phone 	 d 	 	me	up	and	 g 	 ave 	 	me	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 ward 	 	.
i	'm	here	.
so	,	my	wish	.
 dy 	 s 	 lexic 	 	,	so	i	'm	a	bit	 s 	 low 	 	.
my	wish	is	for	you	to	help	a	strong	,	 sustain 	 able 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	to	 educ 	 ate 	 	every	child	about	food	,	to	inspire	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	to	cook	 aga 	 in 	 	,	and	to	empower	people	 every 	 where 	 	to	fight	 obes 	 ity 	 	.
thank	you	.
