i	first	 be 	 came 	 	 fascinate 	 d 	 	with	 oct 	 opus 	 	at	an	early	age	.
i	grew	up	in	mobile	,	alabama	--
 some 	 body 	 	's	got	to	be	from	mobile	,	right	?	--
and	mobile	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	at	the	 con 	 flu 	 ence 	 	of	five	 river 	 s 	 	,	 form 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 del 	 ta 	 	.
and	the	 del 	 ta 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 all 	 igator 	 s 	 	 crawl 	 ing 	 	in	and	out	of	 river 	 s 	 	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	fish	and	 cy 	 press 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	 drip 	 ping 	 	with	 snake 	 s 	 	,	 bird 	 s 	 	of	every	flavor	.
it	's	an	absolute	 magic 	 al 	 	 wonder 	 land 	 	to	live	in	--	if	you	're	a	kid	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 animal 	 s 	 	,	to	grow	up	in	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 del 	 ta 	 	water	 flow 	 s 	 	to	mobile	 ba 	 y 	 	,	and	 final 	 ly 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	of	mexico	.
and	i	remember	my	first	real	contact	with	 oct 	 opus 	 	was	 prob 	 ably 	 	at	age	five	or	six	.
i	was	in	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	,	and	i	was	 swimm 	 ing 	 	around	and	saw	a	little	 oct 	 opus 	 	on	the	bottom	.
and	i	 reach 	 ed 	 	down	and	 pick 	 ed 	 	him	up	,	and	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	 be 	 came 	 	 fascinate 	 d 	 	and	 impress 	 ed 	 	by	 it 	 s 	 	speed	and	 it 	 s 	 	strength	and	 ag 	 ility 	 	.
it	was	 pry 	 ing 	 	my	 finger 	 s 	 	 a 	 part 	 	and	moving	to	the	back	of	my	hand	.
it	was	all	i	could	do	to	hold	onto	 th 	 is 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	creature	.
then	it	sort	of	 calm 	 ed 	 	down	in	the	 palm 	 s 	 	of	my	 hand 	 s 	 	and	 start 	 ed 	 	 flash 	 ing 	 	 color 	 s 	 	,	just	 puls 	 ing 	 	all	of	these	 color 	 s 	 	.	and	 a 	 s 	 	i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	it	,	it	kind	of	 tuck 	 ed 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 arm 	 s 	 	under	it	,	raised	 in 	 to 	 	a	 spheric 	 al 	 	shape	and	 turn 	 ed 	 	chocolate	 brow 	 n 	 	with	two	white	 strip 	 es 	 	.
i	'm	going	,	``	my	 go 	 sh 	 	!	``	i	had	never	 s 	 een 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	in	my	life	!
so	i	 marvel 	 ed 	 	for	a	moment	,	and	then	 decide 	 d 	 	it	was	time	to	 re 	 lease 	 	him	,	so	i	put	him	down	.
the	 oct 	 opus 	 	left	my	 hand 	 s 	 	and	then	did	the	 damn 	 ed 	 est 	 	thing	:
it	 land 	 ed 	 	on	the	bottom	in	the	 rub 	 ble 	 	and	--	 f 	 woosh 	 	!	--	 vanish 	 ed 	 	right	before	my	 eye 	 s 	 	.
and	i	 k 	 new 	 	,	right	then	,	at	age	six	,	that	is	an	animal	that	i	want	to	learn	more	about	.	so	i	did	.
and	i	went	off	to	college	and	got	a	degree	in	marine	 zoo 	 logy 	 	,	and	then	 move 	 d 	 	to	hawaii	and	 enter 	 ed 	 	graduate	school	at	the	university	of	hawaii	.
and	while	a	student	at	hawaii	,	i	 work 	 ed 	 	at	the	waikiki	 aqua 	 rium 	 	.
and	the	 aqua 	 rium 	 	had	a	lot	of	big	fish	 tank 	 s 	 	but	not	a	lot	of	 in 	 vertebrate 	 	 dis 	 play 	 s 	 	,	and	 be 	 ing 	 	the	 s 	 pine 	 less 	 	guy	,	i	thought	,	well	i	'll	just	go	out	in	the	field	and	collect	these	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	i	had	 be 	 en 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	about	 a 	 s 	 	a	student	and	 br 	 ing 	 	them	in	,	and	i	built	these	elaborate	 set 	 s 	 	and	put	them	on	 dis 	 play 	 	.
now	,	the	fish	in	the	 tank 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 gorge 	 ous 	 	to	look	at	,	but	they	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	interact	with	people	.
but	the	 oct 	 opus 	 	did	.
if	you	 walk 	 ed 	 	up	to	an	 oct 	 opus 	 	tank	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	early	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	before	 any 	 one 	 	 arriv 	 ed 	 	,	the	 oct 	 opus 	 	would	rise	up	and	look	at	you	and	you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	is	that	guy	 re 	 ally 	 	looking	at	me	?	he	is	looking	at	me	!	``	and	you	walk	up	to	the	front	of	the	tank	.	then	you	 real 	 ize 	 	that	these	 animal 	 s 	 	all	have	different	 personal 	 ities 	 	:
some	of	them	would	hold	 the 	 ir 	 	ground	,
 other 	 s 	 	would	 s 	 link 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	back	of	the	tank	and	disappear	in	the	 rock 	 s 	 	,
and	one	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	animal	...	i	went	up	to	the	front	of	the	tank	,	and	he	's	just	 star 	 ing 	 	at	me	,
and	he	had	little	 horn 	 s 	 	come	up	above	his	 eye 	 s 	 	.
so	i	went	right	up	to	the	front	of	the	tank	--
i	was	three	or	four	 inch 	 es 	 	from	the	front	glass	--
and	the	 oct 	 opus 	 	was	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	on	a	 per 	 ch 	 	,	a	little	rock	,	and	he	came	off	the	rock	and	he	 al 	 so 	 	came	down	right	to	the	front	of	the	glass	.
so	i	was	 star 	 ing 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	animal	about	six	or	seven	 inch 	 es 	 	away	,	and	at	that	time	i	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	focus	that	close	;	now	 a 	 s 	 	i	look	at	my	 fuzz 	 y 	 	 finger 	 s 	 	i	 real 	 ize 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 day 	 s 	 	are	long	gone	.	 any 	 way 	 	,	there	we	 we 	 re 	 	,	 star 	 ing 	 	at	each	other	,	and	he	 reach 	 es 	 	down	and	 grab 	 s 	 	an	 arm 	 ful 	 	of	 grave 	 l 	 	and	 re 	 lease 	 s 	 	it	in	the	jet	of	water	 enter 	 ing 	 	the	tank	from	the	filtration	system	,	and	--	 ch 	 k 	 	 ch 	 k 	 	 ch 	 k 	 	 ch 	 k 	 	 ch 	 k 	 	!	--	 th 	 is 	 	 grave 	 l 	 	 hit 	 s 	 	the	front	of	the	glass	and	 fall 	 s 	 	down	.
he	 reach 	 es 	 	up	,	 take 	 s 	 	 an 	 other 	 	 arm 	 ful 	 	of	 grave 	 l 	 	,	 re 	 lease 	 s 	 	it	--	 ch 	 k 	 	 ch 	 k 	 	 ch 	 k 	 	 ch 	 k 	 	 ch 	 k 	 	!	--	same	thing	.
then	he	 lift 	 s 	 	 an 	 other 	 	arm	and	i	lift	an	arm	.
then	he	 lift 	 s 	 	 an 	 other 	 	arm	and	i	lift	 an 	 other 	 	arm	.
and	then	i	 real 	 ize 	 	the	 oct 	 opus 	 	won	the	 arm 	 s 	 	race	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	out	and	he	had	six	left	.
but	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	i	can	 de 	 scribe 	 	what	i	was	 see 	 ing 	 	that	day	was	that	 th 	 is 	 	 oct 	 opus 	 	was	 play 	 ing 	 	,	which	is	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	behavior	for	a	mere	 in 	 vertebrate 	 	.
so	,	about	three	 year 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	my	degree	,	a	funny	thing	 happen 	 ed 	 	on	the	way	to	the	 off 	 ice 	 	,	which	 actual 	 ly 	 	 change 	 d 	 	the	course	of	my	life	.
a	man	came	 in 	 to 	 	the	 aqua 	 rium 	 	.	it	's	a	long	story	,	but	 essential 	 ly 	 	he	 s 	 ent 	 	me	and	a	couple	of	 friend 	 s 	 	of	mine	to	the	south	 pac 	 ific 	 	to	collect	 animal 	 s 	 	for	him	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	we	left	,	he	 g 	 ave 	 	us	two	16	-	millimeter	movie	 camera 	 s 	 	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	make	a	movie	about	 th 	 is 	 	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 	.	``	``	ok	,	a	couple	of	 biologist 	 s 	 	making	a	movie	--	 th 	 is 	 	'll	be	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	``
and	off	we	went	.	and	we	did	,	we	made	a	movie	,	which	had	to	be	the	worst	movie	ever	made	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	movie	making	,
but	it	was	a	blast	.	i	had	so	much	 f 	 un 	 	.
and	i	remember	that	proverbial	light	going	off	in	my	head	,	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	wait	a	minute	.
 may 	 be 	 	i	can	do	 th 	 is 	 	all	the	time	.
 yea 	 h 	 	,	i	'll	be	a	 film 	 maker 	 	.	``	so	i	 liter 	 ally 	 	came	back	from	that	job	,	quit	school	,	hung	my	 film 	 making 	 	 shin 	 gle 	 	and	just	never	told	 any 	 one 	 	that	i	did	n't	know	what	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	good	ride	.
and	what	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	in	school	 th 	 ough 	 	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 benefici 	 al 	 	.
if	you	're	a	 wild 	 life 	 	 film 	 maker 	 	and	you	're	going	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	field	to	film	 animal 	 s 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	behavior	,	it	 help 	 s 	 	to	have	a	fundamental	 back 	 ground 	 	on	who	these	 animal 	 s 	 	are	,	how	they	work	and	,	you	know	,	a	bit	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 behavior 	 s 	 	.
but	where	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	about	 oct 	 opus 	 	was	in	the	field	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 film 	 maker 	 	making	 film 	 s 	 	with	them	,	where	you	're	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	 s 	 pend 	 	large	 period 	 s 	 	of	time	with	the	 animal 	 s 	 	,	 see 	 ing 	 	 oct 	 opus 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 oct 	 opus 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	ocean	 home 	 s 	 	.
i	remember	i	took	a	trip	to	australia	,	went	to	an	 is 	 land 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	one	tree	 is 	 land 	 	.
and	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	,	evolution	had	 occur 	 red 	 	at	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	rapid	rate	on	one	tree	,
between	the	time	they	named	it	and	the	time	i	 arriv 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	there	 we 	 re 	 	at	 l 	 east 	 	three	 tree 	 s 	 	on	that	 is 	 land 	 	when	we	 we 	 re 	 	there	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	one	tree	is	 situ 	 ated 	 	right	next	to	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	coral	reef	.
in	fact	,	there	's	a	 s 	 urge 	 	channel	where	the	tide	is	moving	back	and	forth	,	twice	a	day	,	 pre 	 tty 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	.	and	there	's	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	reef	,	 ver 	 y 	 	complex	reef	,	with	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 animal 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	 oct 	 opus 	 	.
and	not	 un 	 ique 	 ly 	 	but	 certain 	 ly 	 	,	the	 oct 	 opus 	 	in	australia	are	 master 	 s 	 	at	camouflage	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	matter	of	fact	,	there	's	one	right	there	.
so	our	first	 challeng 	 e 	 	was	to	find	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	that	was	a	 challeng 	 e 	 	,	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	.
but	the	idea	is	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	there	for	a	month	and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 acclim 	 ate 	 	the	 animal 	 s 	 	to	us
so	that	we	could	see	 behavior 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 disturb 	 ing 	 	them	.
so	the	first	week	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 s 	 pent 	 	just	 get 	 ting 	 	 a 	 s 	 	close	 a 	 s 	 	we	could	,	every	day	a	little	 close 	 r 	 	,	a	little	 close 	 r 	 	,	a	little	 close 	 r 	 	.
and	you	 k 	 new 	 	what	the	limit	was	:	they	would	start	 get 	 ting 	 	 twitch 	 y 	 	and	you	'd	back	up	,	come	back	in	a	few	 hour 	 s 	 	.
and	after	the	first	week	,	they	 ignor 	 ed 	 	us	.
it	was	like	,	``	i	do	n't	know	what	that	thing	is	,	but	he	's	no	threat	to	me	.	``	so	they	went	on	about	 the 	 ir 	 	business
and	from	a	foot	away	,	we	're	 watch 	 ing 	 	 mat 	 ing 	 	and	 court 	 ing 	 	and	 fight 	 ing 	 	and	it	is	just	an	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	experience	.
and	one	of	the	most	fantastic	 dis 	 play 	 s 	 	that	i	remember	,	or	at	 l 	 east 	 	 visual 	 ly 	 	,	was	a	 for 	 aging 	 	behavior	.
and	they	had	a	lot	of	different	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	that	they	would	use	for	 for 	 aging 	 	,
but	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	one	used	vision	.
and	they	would	see	a	coral	head	,	 may 	 be 	 	10	feet	away	,	and	start	moving	over	 to 	 ward 	 	that	coral	head	.
and	i	do	n't	know	 whet 	 her 	 	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	saw	crab	in	it	,	or	 imagin 	 ed 	 	that	one	might	be	,	but	 what 	 ever 	 	the	case	,	they	would	leap	off	the	bottom	and	go	through	the	water	and	land	right	on	top	of	 th 	 is 	 	coral	head	,	and	then	the	web	between	the	 arm 	 s 	 	would	 complete 	 ly 	 	engulf	the	coral	head	,	and	they	would	fish	out	,	swim	for	 crab 	 s 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	the	 crab 	 s 	 	 touch 	 ed 	 	the	arm	,	it	was	 light 	 s 	 	out	.
and	i	 al 	 ways 	 	 wonder 	 ed 	 	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	under	that	web	.
so	we	 create 	 d 	 	a	way	to	find	out	,
and	i	got	my	first	look	at	that	famous	beak	in	action	.
it	was	fantastic	.
if	you	're	going	to	make	a	lot	of	 film 	 s 	 	about	a	 part 	 icular 	 	group	of	 animal 	 s 	 	,	you	might	 a 	 s 	 	well	pick	one	that	's	 fair 	 ly 	 	common	.
and	 oct 	 opus 	 	are	,	they	live	in	all	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	.
they	 al 	 so 	 	live	deep	.
and	i	ca	n't	say	 oct 	 opus 	 	are	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	my	 re 	 ally 	 	strong	interest	in	 get 	 ting 	 	in	 sub 	 s 	 	and	going	deep	,	but	 what 	 ever 	 	the	case	,	i	like	that	.
it	's	like	 noth 	 ing 	 	you	've	ever	 d 	 one 	 	.
if	you	ever	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	get	away	from	it	all	and	see	 some 	 thing 	 	that	you	have	never	 s 	 een 	 	,	and	have	an	 excel 	 lent 	 	chance	of	 see 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	no	one	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	 s 	 een 	 	,	get	in	a	sub	.
you	climb	in	,	seal	the	hatch	,	turn	on	a	little	oxygen	,	turn	on	the	 scrub 	 ber 	 	,	which	 re 	 move 	 s 	 	the	co	2	in	the	air	you	breathe	,	and	they	chuck	you	 over 	 board 	 	.
down	you	go	.	there	's	no	 connect 	 ion 	 	to	the	surface	 a 	 part 	 	from	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	 funk 	 y 	 	radio	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	go	down	,	the	 wash 	 ing 	 	machine	at	the	surface	 calm 	 s 	 	down	.
and	it	 get 	 s 	 	quiet	.
and	it	 start 	 s 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	nice	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	go	 deep 	 er 	 	,	that	 love 	 ly 	 	,	blue	water	you	 we 	 re 	 	 launch 	 ed 	 	in	 give 	 s 	 	way	to	 dark 	 er 	 	and	 dark 	 er 	 	blue	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	a	rich	 lav 	 end 	 er 	 	,	and	after	a	couple	of	thousand	feet	,	it	's	ink	black	.
and	now	you	've	 enter 	 ed 	 	the	realm	of	the	mid	-	water	community	.
you	could	give	an	entire	talk	about	the	 creature 	 s 	 	that	live	in	the	mid	-	water	.
 suff 	 ice 	 	to	say	 th 	 ough 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	i	'm	 concern 	 ed 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	question	,	the	most	bizarre	 design 	 s 	 	and	 out 	 rage 	 ous 	 	 behavior 	 s 	 	are	in	the	 animal 	 s 	 	that	live	in	the	mid	-	water	community	.
but	we	're	just	going	to	zip	right	past	 th 	 is 	 	area	,	 th 	 is 	 	area	that	 include 	 s 	 	about	95	percent	of	the	living	space	on	our	planet	and	go	to	the	mid	-	ocean	ridge	,	which	i	think	is	even	more	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	.
the	mid	-	ocean	ridge	is	a	huge	mountain	range	,	40,000	 mile 	 s 	 	long	,	 s 	 na 	 king 	 	around	the	entire	 glob 	 e 	 	.
and	they	're	big	 mountain 	 s 	 	,	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	feet	tall	,	some	of	which	are	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	feet	and	bust	through	the	surface	,	creating	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	like	hawaii	.
and	the	top	of	 th 	 is 	 	mountain	range	is	 split 	 ting 	 	 a 	 part 	 	,	creating	a	rift	 val 	 ley 	 	.
and	when	you	 d 	 ive 	 	 in 	 to 	 	that	rift	 val 	 ley 	 	,	that	's	where	the	action	is	 be 	 cause 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	active	 volcan 	 o 	 es 	 	are	going	off	at	any	point	in	time	all	 a 	 long 	 	 th 	 is 	 	40,000	mile	range	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	these	tectonic	 plate 	 s 	 	are	 spread 	 ing 	 	 a 	 part 	 	,	magma	,	lava	is	coming	up	and	 fill 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 gap 	 s 	 	,
and	you	're	looking	land	--	new	land	--	 be 	 ing 	 	 create 	 d 	 	right	before	your	 eye 	 s 	 	.
and	over	the	 top 	 s 	 	of	them	is	3,000	to	4,000	 meter 	 s 	 	of	water	creating	enormous	pressure	,	forcing	water	down	through	the	 crack 	 s 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	the	center	of	the	earth	,	 un 	 til 	 	it	 hit 	 s 	 	a	magma	chamber	where	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 super 	 heated 	 	and	 super 	 saturate 	 d 	 	with	 mineral 	 s 	 	,	 reverse 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	flow	and	 start 	 s 	 	 shoot 	 ing 	 	back	to	the	surface	and	is	 eject 	 ed 	 	out	of	the	earth	like	a	geyser	at	yellowstone	.
in	fact	,	 th 	 is 	 	whole	area	is	like	a	yellowstone	national	park	with	all	of	the	 trim 	 ming 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	vent	fluid	is	about	600	or	700	 degree 	 s 	 	f	.
the	 surround 	 ing 	 	water	is	just	a	couple	of	 degree 	 s 	 	above	freezing	.
so	it	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	 cool 	 s 	 	,	and	it	can	no	 long 	 er 	 	hold	in	 s 	 us 	 pension 	 	all	of	the	material	that	it	's	 dis 	 solve 	 d 	 	,	and	it	 precipit 	 ates 	 	out	,	 form 	 ing 	 	black	smoke	.
and	it	 form 	 s 	 	these	 tower 	 s 	 	,	these	 chimney 	 s 	 	that	are	10	,	20	,	30	feet	tall	.
and	all	 a 	 long 	 	the	 side 	 s 	 	of	these	 chimney 	 s 	 	is	 shimmer 	 ing 	 	with	heat	and	 load 	 ed 	 	with	life	.
you	've	got	black	 smok 	 ers 	 	going	all	over	the	place	and	 chimney 	 s 	 	that	have	tube	 worm 	 s 	 	that	might	be	eight	to	10	feet	long	.
and	out	of	the	 top 	 s 	 	of	these	tube	 worm 	 s 	 	are	these	 beaut 	 iful 	 	red	 plume 	 s 	 	.
and	living	 among 	 st 	 	the	tangle	of	tube	 worm 	 s 	 	is	an	entire	community	of	 animal 	 s 	 	:	shrimp	,	fish	,	 lob 	 sters 	 	,	crab	,	 clam 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 warm 	 s 	 	of	 arthro 	 pods 	 	that	are	 play 	 ing 	 	that	 danger 	 ous 	 	game	between	over	here	is	 scal 	 d 	 ing 	 	hot	and	freezing	cold	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	whole	 eco 	 system 	 	was	n't	even	known	about	 un 	 til 	 	33	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	it	 complete 	 ly 	 	threw	science	on	 it 	 s 	 	head	.
it	made	 scientist 	 s 	 	 re 	 think 	 	where	life	on	earth	might	have	 actual 	 ly 	 	 beg 	 un 	 	.
and	before	the	 discover 	 y 	 	of	these	 vent 	 s 	 	,	all	life	on	earth	,	the	key	to	life	on	earth	,	was	 believ 	 ed 	 	to	be	the	 s 	 un 	 	and	 photo 	 synthesis 	 	.	but	down	there	,	there	is	no	 s 	 un 	 	,	there	is	no	 photo 	 synthesis 	 	;
it	's	 chemo 	 synthetic 	 	environment	down	there	 driv 	 ing 	 	it	,	and	it	's	all	so	ephemeral	.
you	might	film	 th 	 is 	 	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	 hydro 	 thermal 	 	vent	,	which	you	think	at	the	time	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	on	 an 	 other 	 	planet	.
it	's	 amaz 	 ing 	 	to	think	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	on	earth	;
it	 look 	 s 	 	like	 alien 	 s 	 	in	an	alien	environment	.
but	you	go	back	to	the	same	vent	eight	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	and	it	can	be	 complete 	 ly 	 	dead	.
there	's	no	hot	water	.
all	of	the	 animal 	 s 	 	are	gone	,	they	're	dead	,
and	the	 chimney 	 s 	 	are	still	there	creating	a	 re 	 ally 	 	nice	ghost	town	,	an	 eer 	 ie 	 	,	 s 	 pooky 	 	ghost	town	,	but	 essential 	 ly 	 	 de 	 void 	 	of	 animal 	 s 	 	,	of	course	.
but	10	 mile 	 s 	 	down	the	ridge	...	 ps 	 hhh 	 	!	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	 volcan 	 o 	 	going	.
and	there	's	a	whole	new	 hydro 	 thermal 	 	vent	community	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 form 	 ed 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	life	and	death	of	 hydro 	 thermal 	 	vent	 commun 	 ities 	 	is	going	on	every	30	or	40	 year 	 s 	 	all	 a 	 long 	 	the	ridge	.
and	that	ephemeral	nature	of	the	 hydro 	 thermal 	 	vent	community	is	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	different	from	some	of	the	 area 	 s 	 	that	i	've	 s 	 een 	 	in	35	 year 	 s 	 	of	 travel 	 ing 	 	around	,	making	 film 	 s 	 	.
where	you	go	and	film	a	 re 	 ally 	 	nice	sequence	at	a	 ba 	 y 	 	.
and	you	go	back	,	and	i	'm	at	home	,	and	i	'm	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	what	can	i	shoot	...
ah	!	i	know	where	i	can	shoot	that	.
there	's	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 ba 	 y 	 	,	 lot 	 s 	 	of	soft	 coral 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 tomato 	 pods 	 	.	``	and	you	show	up	,	and	it	's	dead	.
there	's	no	coral	,	 al 	 ga 	 e 	 	growing	on	it	,	and	the	water	's	pea	soup	.
you	think	,	``	well	,	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	?	``	and	you	turn	around	,	and	there	's	a	 hill 	 side 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	you	with	a	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	going	in	,	and	 bulldoze 	 rs 	 	are	 push 	 ing 	 	 pile 	 s 	 	of	 s 	 oil 	 	back	and	forth	.
and	over	here	there	's	a	golf	course	going	in	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 tropic 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 rain 	 ing 	 	like	crazy	here	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 rain 	 water 	 	is	 flood 	 ing 	 	down	the	 hill 	 side 	 	,	 carry 	 ing 	 	with	it	 sediment 	 s 	 	from	the	construction	 s 	 ite 	 	,	 s 	 mother 	 ing 	 	the	coral	and	 kill 	 ing 	 	it	.
and	 fertil 	 izer 	 s 	 	and	 pest 	 icide 	 s 	 	are	 flow 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 ba 	 y 	 	from	the	golf	course	--
the	 pest 	 icide 	 s 	 	 kill 	 ing 	 	all	the	 larva 	 e 	 	and	little	 animal 	 s 	 	,	 fertil 	 izer 	 	creating	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	plankton	bloom	--
and	there	's	your	pea	soup	.
but	,	 encourag 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	i	've	 s 	 een 	 	just	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	to	a	place	that	was	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	 trash 	 ed 	 	 ba 	 y 	 	.
and	i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	it	,	just	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 yu 	 ck 	 	,	``	and	go	and	work	on	the	other	side	of	the	 is 	 land 	 	.
five	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	come	back	,	and	that	same	 ba 	 y 	 	is	now	 gorge 	 ous 	 	.	it	's	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
it	's	got	living	coral	,	fish	all	over	the	place	,	crystal	clear	water	,	and	you	go	,	``	how	did	that	happen	?	``	well	,	how	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	is	the	local	community	 galvan 	 ized 	 	.
they	 recogn 	 ized 	 	what	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	on	the	 hill 	 side 	 	and	put	a	stop	to	it	;	 enact 	 ed 	 	 law 	 s 	 	and	made	 permit 	 s 	 	 requir 	 ed 	 	to	do	 respons 	 ible 	 	construction	and	golf	course	maintenance	and	 stop 	 ped 	 	the	 sediment 	 s 	 	 flow 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 ba 	 y 	 	,	and	 stop 	 ped 	 	the	 chemical 	 s 	 	 flow 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 ba 	 y 	 	,	and	the	 ba 	 y 	 	 re 	 cover 	 ed 	 	.
the	ocean	 ha 	 s 	 	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	ability	to	 re 	 cover 	 	,	if	we	'll	just	 leav 	 e 	 	it	 al 	 one 	 	.
i	think	margaret	mead	 s 	 aid 	 	it	best	.
she	 s 	 aid 	 	that	a	small	group	of	 thought 	 ful 	 	people	could	change	the	world	.
 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	it	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	that	ever	 ha 	 s 	 	.
and	a	small	group	of	 thought 	 ful 	 	people	 change 	 d 	 	that	 ba 	 y 	 	.
i	'm	a	big	fan	of	 grass 	 root 	 s 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	to	a	lot	of	 lectur 	 es 	 	where	,	at	the	end	of	it	,	 inevit 	 ably 	 	,	one	of	the	first	 question 	 s 	 	that	 come 	 s 	 	up	is	,	``	but	,	but	what	can	i	do	?
i	'm	an	individual	.	i	'm	one	person	.
and	these	 problem 	 s 	 	are	so	large	and	global	,	and	it	's	just	 overwhelm 	 ing 	 	.	``	fair	 en 	 ough 	 	question	.
my	answer	to	that	is	do	n't	look	at	the	big	,	 overwhelm 	 ing 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	of	the	world	.
look	in	your	own	 back 	 yard 	 	.
look	in	your	heart	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
what	do	you	 re 	 ally 	 	care	about	that	is	n't	right	where	you	live	?
and	fix	it	.
create	a	 heal 	 ing 	 	zone	in	your	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	and	 encourag 	 e 	 	 other 	 s 	 	to	do	the	same	.
and	 may 	 be 	 	these	 heal 	 ing 	 	 zone 	 s 	 	can	 sprinkl 	 e 	 	a	map	,	little	 dot 	 s 	 	on	a	map	.
and	in	fact	,	the	way	that	we	can	communicate	 to 	 day 	 	--	where	alaska	is	 instant 	 ly 	 	 know 	 ing 	 	what	's	going	on	in	 chin 	 a 	 	,	and	the	kiwis	did	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	then	over	in	england	they	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	...	and	 every 	 body 	 	is	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	 every 	 one 	 	else	--
it	's	not	 isolate 	 d 	 	 point 	 s 	 	on	a	map	 any 	 more 	 	,	it	's	a	network	we	've	 create 	 d 	 	.
and	 may 	 be 	 	these	 heal 	 ing 	 	 zone 	 s 	 	can	start	growing	,	and	possibly	even	 over 	 lap 	 	,	and	good	 thing 	 s 	 	can	happen	.
so	that	's	how	i	answer	that	question	.
look	in	your	own	 back 	 yard 	 	,	in	fact	,	look	in	the	mirror	.
what	can	you	do	that	is	more	 respons 	 ible 	 	than	what	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	now	?
and	do	that	,	and	spread	the	word	.
the	vent	community	 animal 	 s 	 	ca	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	do	much	about	the	life	and	death	that	's	going	on	where	they	live	,	but	up	here	we	can	.
in	 theor 	 y 	 	,	we	're	 think 	 ing 	 	,	rational	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
and	we	can	make	 change 	 s 	 	to	our	behavior	that	will	influence	and	affect	the	environment	,	like	 t 	 hose 	 	people	 change 	 d 	 	the	health	of	that	 ba 	 y 	 	.
now	,	sylvia	's	ted	prize	wish	was	to	beseech	us	to	do	 any 	 thing 	 	we	could	,	 every 	 thing 	 	we	could	,	to	set	 a 	 side 	 	not	pin	 prick 	 s 	 	,	but	significant	 expanse 	 s 	 	of	the	ocean	for	 p 	 reservation 	 	,	``	hope	 spot 	 s 	 	,	``	she	 call 	 s 	 	them	.
and	i	applaud	that	.	i	 loud 	 ly 	 	applaud	that	.
and	it	's	my	hope	that	some	of	these	``	hope	 spot 	 s 	 	``	can	be	in	the	deep	ocean	,	an	area	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 historic 	 ally 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 serious 	 ly 	 	 neglect 	 ed 	 	,	if	not	 abuse 	 d 	 	.	the	term	``	deep	six	``	 come 	 s 	 	to	mind	:
``	if	it	's	too	big	or	too	toxic	for	a	 land 	 fill 	 	,	deep	six	it	!	``
so	,	i	hope	that	we	can	 al 	 so 	 	keep	some	of	these	``	hope	 spot 	 s 	 	``	in	the	deep	sea	.
now	,	i	do	n't	get	a	wish	,	but	i	 certain 	 ly 	 	can	say	that	i	will	do	 any 	 thing 	 	i	can	to	support	sylvia	earle	's	wish	.
and	that	i	do	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
