so	the	question	is	,	what	is	 in 	 visible 	 	?
there	is	more	of	it	than	you	think	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
 every 	 thing 	 	,	i	would	say	.	 every 	 thing 	 	that	 matter 	 s 	 	 ex 	 cept 	 	every	thing	and	 ex 	 cept 	 	matter	.	we	can	see	matter	.	but	we	ca	n't	see	what	's	the	matter	.
 a 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 cry 	 p 	 tic 	 	sentence	i	found	in	the	 guard 	 ian 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	:
``	the	marriage	 suffer 	 ed 	 	a	 set 	 back 	 	in	1965	,	when	the	husband	was	 kill 	 ed 	 	by	the	wife	.	``
there	's	a	world	of	 in 	 vis 	 ibility 	 	there	,	is	n't	there	?
so	,	we	can	see	the	 star 	 s 	 	and	the	 planet 	 s 	 	,
but	we	ca	n't	see	what	 hold 	 s 	 	them	 a 	 part 	 	or	what	 draw 	 s 	 	them	together	.
with	matter	,	 a 	 s 	 	with	people	,	we	see	 on 	 ly 	 	the	skin	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
we	ca	n't	see	 in 	 to 	 	the	engine	room	.
we	ca	n't	see	what	 make 	 s 	 	people	tick	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	not	 with 	 out 	 	 difficult 	 y 	 	.
and	the	 close 	 r 	 	we	look	at	 any 	 thing 	 	,	the	more	it	 disappear 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	if	you	look	 re 	 ally 	 	 close 	 ly 	 	at	stuff	,	if	you	look	at	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	 sub 	 structure 	 	of	matter	,	there	is	n't	 any 	 thing 	 	there	.
 electron 	 s 	 	disappear	in	a	kind	of	fuzz	,	and	there	is	 on 	 ly 	 	energy	.	and	you	ca	n't	see	energy	.
so	 every 	 thing 	 	that	 matter 	 s 	 	,	that	's	 import 	 ant 	 	,	is	 in 	 visible 	 	.
one	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 s 	 il 	 ly 	 	thing	that	's	 in 	 visible 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	story	,	which	is	 in 	 visible 	 	to	you	.
and	i	'm	now	going	to	make	it	visible	to	you	in	your	 mind 	 s 	 	.
it	's	about	an	m.p	.	 call 	 ed 	 	geoffrey	dickens	.
the	late	geoffrey	dickens	,	m.p	.	was	 attend 	 ing 	 	a	 fet 	 e 	 	in	his	 constit 	 uency 	 	.
 where 	 ver 	 	he	went	,	at	every	stall	he	 stop 	 ped 	 	he	was	 close 	 ly 	 	 follow 	 ed 	 	by	a	 devote 	 d 	 	 smil 	 ing 	 	woman	of	 indescrib 	 able 	 	 ugli 	 ness 	 	.
try	 a 	 s 	 	he	might	,	he	could	n't	get	away	from	her	.
a	few	 day 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	he	 receiv 	 ed 	 	a	letter	from	a	 constit 	 uent 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	how	much	she	 admire 	 d 	 	him	,	had	met	him	at	a	 fet 	 e 	 	and	 ask 	 ing 	 	for	a	 sign 	 ed 	 	photograph	.
after	her	name	,	written	in	brackets	was	the	apt	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	,	horse	face	.
``	i	've	 mis 	 judg 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	women	,	``	thought	mr.	dickens	.
``	not	 on 	 ly 	 	is	she	aware	of	her	physical	 repulsive 	 ness 	 	,	she	 turn 	 s 	 	it	to	her	advantage	.
a	photo	is	not	 en 	 ough 	 	.	``
so	he	went	out	and	 b 	 ought 	 	a	plastic	frame	to	put	the	photograph	in	.
and	on	the	photograph	,	he	wrote	with	a	flourish	,	``	to	horse	face	,	with	love	from	geoffrey	dickens	,	m.p.	``
after	it	had	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 ent 	 	off	,	his	 secret 	 ary 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	to	him	,	``	did	you	get	that	letter	from	the	woman	at	the	 fet 	 e 	 	?
i	wrote	horse	face	on	her	,	so	you	'd	remember	who	she	was	.	``
i	bet	he	thought	he	 wish 	 ed 	 	he	was	 in 	 visible 	 	,	do	n't	you	?
so	,	one	of	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	about	 in 	 vis 	 ibility 	 	is	that	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	ca	n't	see	we	 al 	 so 	 	ca	n't	understand	.
 gravit 	 y 	 	is	one	thing	that	we	ca	n't	see	and	which	we	do	n't	understand	.
it	's	the	 l 	 east 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	of	all	the	four	fundamental	 force 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 weak 	 est 	 	.
and	 no 	 body 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 know 	 s 	 	what	it	is	or	why	it	's	there	.
for	what	it	's	worth	,	 s 	 ir 	 	isaac	newton	,	the	 great 	 est 	 	scientist	who	ever	lived	,	he	thought	jesus	came	to	earth	 specific 	 ally 	 	to	 oper 	 ate 	 	the	 lever 	 s 	 	of	 gravit 	 y 	 	.
that	's	what	he	thought	he	was	there	for	.
so	,	bright	guy	,	could	be	wrong	on	that	one	,	i	do	n't	know	.
 conscious 	 ness 	 	.	i	see	all	your	 face 	 s 	 	.
i	have	no	idea	what	any	of	you	are	 think 	 ing 	 	.	is	n't	that	 amaz 	 ing 	 	?
is	n't	that	 in 	 credible 	 	that	we	ca	n't	read	each	other	's	 mind 	 s 	 	?
but	we	can	touch	each	other	,	taste	each	other	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	if	we	get	close	 en 	 ough 	 	.
but	we	ca	n't	read	each	other	's	 mind 	 s 	 	.	i	find	that	 quit 	 e 	 	 astonish 	 ing 	 	.
in	the	sufi	faith	,	 th 	 is 	 	great	middle	eastern	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	which	some	claim	is	the	route	of	all	 relig 	 ions 	 	,	sufi	 master 	 s 	 	are	all	 tele 	 path 	 s 	 	,	so	they	say	.
but	 the 	 ir 	 	main	 exercis 	 e 	 	of	 tele 	 pathy 	 	is	to	 s 	 end 	 	out	 power 	 ful 	 	 signal 	 s 	 	to	the	rest	of	us	that	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	exist	.
so	that	's	why	we	do	n't	think	it	 exist 	 s 	 	,	the	sufi	 master 	 s 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	us	.
in	the	question	of	 conscious 	 ness 	 	and	artificial	 intellig 	 ence 	 	,
artificial	 intellig 	 ence 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	,	like	the	 stud 	 y 	 	of	 conscious 	 ness 	 	,	gotten	 no 	 where 	 	.	we	have	no	idea	how	 conscious 	 ness 	 	 work 	 s 	 	.
with	artificial	 intellig 	 ence 	 	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	have	they	not	 create 	 d 	 	artificial	 intellig 	 ence 	 	,	they	have	n't	yet	 create 	 d 	 	artificial	 stupid 	 ity 	 	.

 an 	 other 	 	thing	we	ca	n't	see	is	the	human	genome	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 increasing 	 ly 	 	peculiar	,
 be 	 cause 	 	about	20	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	when	they	 start 	 ed 	 	 de 	 lv 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	genome	,	they	thought	it	would	 prob 	 ably 	 	contain	around	100,000	 gene 	 s 	 	.

 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	where	all	the	stuff	 happen 	 s 	 	that	 make 	 s 	 	you	who	you	are	.
 an 	 other 	 	thing	you	ca	n't	see	is	the	grid	on	which	we	hang	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 fasci 	 nating 	 	.	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	know	,	some	of	you	,	that	 cell 	 s 	 	are	 continu 	 ally 	 	 renew 	 ed 	 	.	you	can	see	it	in	skin	and	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	stuff	.
