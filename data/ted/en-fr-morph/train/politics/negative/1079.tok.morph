we	face	 moment 	 ous 	 	 decision 	 s 	 	with	 import 	 ant 	 	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	 through 	 out 	 	our	 live 	 s 	 	,
and	we	have	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	for	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	these	 decision 	 s 	 	.
we	talk	 thing 	 s 	 	over	with	our	 friend 	 s 	 	,	we	scour	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	we	search	through	 book 	 s 	 	.	but	still	,	even	in	 th 	 is 	 	age	of	google	and	tripadvisor	and	amazon	 recommend 	 s 	 	,	it	's	still	 expert 	 s 	 	that	we	 re 	 ly 	 	 up 	 on 	 	most	--	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	when	the	 s 	 take 	 s 	 	are	high	and	the	decision	 re 	 ally 	 	 matter 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	in	a	world	of	data	 del 	 uge 	 	and	 extrem 	 e 	 	 complex 	 ity 	 	,	we	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 expert 	 s 	 	are	more	able	to	process	information	than	we	can	--	that	they	are	able	to	come	to	better	 con 	 clusion 	 s 	 	than	we	could	come	to	on	our	own	.
and	in	an	age	that	is	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 now 	 a 	 day 	 s 	 	 frighten 	 ing 	 	or	 con 	 fusing 	 	,	we	feel	 re 	 assur 	 ed 	 	by	the	 al 	 most 	 	 parent 	 al 	 	-	like	 author 	 ity 	 	of	 expert 	 s 	 	who	tell	us	so	 clear 	 ly 	 	what	it	is	we	can	and	can	not	do	.
but	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	big	problem	,	a	problem	with	 potential 	 ly 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	for	us	 a 	 s 	 	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	culture	and	 a 	 s 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	.
it	's	not	that	 expert 	 s 	 	have	not	 massive 	 ly 	 	 con 	 tribute 	 d 	 	to	the	world	--	of	course	they	have	.
the	problem	lies	with	us	:	we	've	 be 	 come 	 	 addict 	 ed 	 	to	 expert 	 s 	 	.
we	've	 be 	 come 	 	 addict 	 ed 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 certain 	 ty 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 assur 	 ed 	 ness 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 definitive 	 ness 	 	,	and	in	the	process	,	we	have	 cede 	 d 	 	our	 respons 	 ibility 	 	,	 substitut 	 ing 	 	our	 in 	 tell 	 ect 	 	and	our	 intellig 	 ence 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 suppose 	 d 	 	 word 	 s 	 	of	 wis 	 dom 	 	.
we	've	 surrender 	 ed 	 	our	power	,	 tra 	 d 	 ing 	 	off	our	 dis 	 comfort 	 	with	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	for	the	illusion	of	 certain 	 ty 	 	that	they	provide	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	no	 exagge 	 ration 	 	.
in	a	 re 	 cent 	 	experiment	,	a	group	of	 adult 	 s 	 	had	 the 	 ir 	 	 brain 	 s 	 	 s 	 can 	 ned 	 	in	an	mri	machine	 a 	 s 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	 expert 	 s 	 	speak	.
the	 result 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	they	 listen 	 ed 	 	to	the	 expert 	 s 	 	'	 voice 	 s 	 	,	the	 in 	 dependent 	 	decision	-	making	 part 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 brain 	 s 	 	 s 	 witch 	 ed 	 	off	.
it	 liter 	 ally 	 	flat	-	lined	.
and	they	 listen 	 ed 	 	to	 what 	 ever 	 	the	 expert 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	and	took	 the 	 ir 	 	 ad 	 vice 	 	,	 how 	 ever 	 	right	or	wrong	.
but	 expert 	 s 	 	do	get	 thing 	 s 	 	wrong	.
did	you	know	that	 stud 	 ies 	 	show	that	 doctor 	 s 	 	 mis 	 diagnos 	 e 	 	four	 time 	 s 	 	out	of	10	?
did	you	know	that	if	you	file	your	tax	 return 	 s 	 	 your 	 self 	 	,	you	're	 statistic 	 ally 	 	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	be	filing	them	 correct 	 ly 	 	than	if	you	get	a	tax	 advise 	 r 	 	to	do	it	for	you	?
and	then	there	's	,	of	course	,	the	 ex 	 ample 	 	that	we	're	all	too	aware	of	:	financial	 expert 	 s 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	it	so	wrong	that	we	're	living	through	the	worst	 recess 	 ion 	 	since	the	1930s	.
for	the	sake	of	our	health	,	our	wealth	and	our	 collect 	 ive 	 	security	,	it	's	 imper 	 ative 	 	that	we	keep	the	 in 	 dependent 	 	decision	-	making	 part 	 s 	 	of	our	 brain 	 s 	 	 s 	 witch 	 ed 	 	on	.

and	we	've	 al 	 so 	 	got	to	be	aware	that	 expert 	 s 	 	,	of	course	,	 al 	 so 	 	make	 mistak 	 es 	 	.
they	make	 mistak 	 es 	 	every	single	day	--	 mistak 	 es 	 	born	out	of	 care 	 lessness 	 	.

a	common	 think 	 ing 	 	error	of	 radio 	 logists 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	--	when	they	look	at	ct	 s 	 can 	 s 	 	--	is	that	they	're	 over 	 ly 	 	 influence 	 d 	 	by	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	that	the	 refer 	 ring 	 	physician	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	that	he	 suspect 	 s 	 	the	patient	's	problem	to	be	.

these	are	,	of	course	,	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 in 	 sight 	 s 	 	i	could	share	,	but	i	hope	they	give	you	a	clear	sense	at	 l 	 east 	 	of	why	we	need	to	stop	 kow 	 tow 	 ing 	 	to	them	,	why	we	need	to	rebel	and	why	we	need	to	 s 	 witch 	 	our	 in 	 dependent 	 	decision	-	making	 cap 	 abilities 	 	on	.
but	how	can	we	do	 th 	 is 	 	?
well	for	the	sake	of	time	,	i	want	to	focus	on	just	three	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	.
first	,	we	've	got	to	be	ready	and	 will 	 ing 	 	to	take	 expert 	 s 	 	on	and	 dispens 	 e 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	of	them	 a 	 s 	 	modern	-	day	 a 	 post 	 les 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	get	a	ph.d.	in	every	single	subject	,	you	'll	be	 reliev 	 ed 	 	to	hear	.
but	it	 do 	 es 	 	mean	 persist 	 ing 	 	in	the	face	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 inevit 	 able 	 	 annoy 	 ance 	 	when	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	we	want	them	to	explain	 thing 	 s 	 	to	us	in	language	that	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	understand	.
why	was	it	that	,	when	i	had	an	operation	,	my	doctor	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	``	 be 	 ware 	 	,	ms.	hertz	,	of	 hyper 	 py 	 re 	 xia 	 	,	``	when	he	could	have	just	 a 	 s 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	watch	out	for	a	high	 f 	 ever 	 	.	``
you	see	,	 be 	 ing 	 	ready	to	take	 expert 	 s 	 	on	is	about	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 will 	 ing 	 	to	dig	 be 	 hind 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 graph 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 equ 	 ations 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 fore 	 cast 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 prop 	 he 	 cies 	 	,	and	 be 	 ing 	 	 arm 	 ed 	 	with	the	 question 	 s 	 	to	do	that	--	 question 	 s 	 	like	:	what	are	the	 assumption 	 s 	 	that	 under 	 pin 	 	 th 	 is 	 	?
what	is	the	evidence	 up 	 on 	 	which	 th 	 is 	 	is	based	?
what	 ha 	 s 	 	your	investigation	focused	on	?
and	what	 ha 	 s 	 	it	 ignor 	 ed 	 	?
it	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	came	out	that	 expert 	 s 	 	 trial 	 ing 	 	 drug 	 s 	 	before	they	come	to	market	 typical 	 ly 	 	trial	 drug 	 s 	 	first	,	 prim 	 arily 	 	on	male	 animal 	 s 	 	and	then	,	 prim 	 arily 	 	on	men	.
it	 seem 	 s 	 	that	they	've	 some 	 how 	 	 overlook 	 ed 	 	the	fact	that	over	half	the	world	's	population	are	women	.
and	women	have	drawn	the	short	medical	straw	 be 	 cause 	 	it	now	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	 man 	 y 	 	of	these	 drug 	 s 	 	do	n't	work	 near 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	on	women	 a 	 s 	 	they	do	on	men	--	and	the	 drug 	 s 	 	that	do	work	well	work	so	well	that	they	're	 active 	 ly 	 	 harm 	 ful 	 	for	women	to	take	.

second	,	we	need	to	create	the	space	for	what	i	call	``	 manage 	 d 	 	 dis 	 s 	 ent 	 	.	``
if	we	are	to	shift	 paradigm 	 s 	 	,	if	we	are	to	make	 break 	 through 	 s 	 	,	if	we	are	to	destroy	 myth 	 s 	 	,	we	need	to	create	an	environment	in	which	expert	 idea 	 s 	 	are	 batt 	 ling 	 	it	out	,	in	which	we	're	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	in	new	,	 divers 	 e 	 	,	 dis 	 cord 	 ant 	 	,	 here 	 tic 	 al 	 	 view 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 discuss 	 ion 	 	,	 fear 	 lessly 	 	,	in	the	knowledge	that	progress	 come 	 s 	 	about	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	from	the	creation	of	 idea 	 s 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 destruct 	 ion 	 	--	and	 al 	 so 	 	from	the	knowledge	that	,	by	 surround 	 ing 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	by	 diverge 	 nt 	 	,	 dis 	 cord 	 ant 	 	,	 here 	 tic 	 al 	 	 view 	 s 	 	.	all	the	research	now	 show 	 s 	 	us	that	 th 	 is 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 make 	 s 	 	us	 smart 	 er 	 	.
 encourag 	 ing 	 	 dis 	 s 	 ent 	 	is	a	 re 	 bell 	 ious 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 go 	 es 	 	against	our	 ver 	 y 	 	 instinct 	 s 	 	,	which	are	to	surround	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	with	 opinion 	 s 	 	and	 ad 	 vice 	 	that	we	 al 	 ready 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	or	want	to	be	true	.
and	that	's	why	i	talk	about	the	need	to	 active 	 ly 	 	manage	 dis 	 s 	 ent 	 	.
google	ceo	eric	schmidt	is	a	practical	practitioner	of	 th 	 is 	 	 philosoph 	 y 	 	.
in	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	he	 look 	 s 	 	out	for	the	person	in	the	room	--	 arm 	 s 	 	 cross 	 ed 	 	,	looking	a	bit	 be 	 mus 	 ed 	 	--	and	 draw 	 s 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	the	 discuss 	 ion 	 	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	see	if	they	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	are	the	person	with	a	different	opinion	,	so	that	they	have	 dis 	 s 	 ent 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	room	.
 man 	 aging 	 	 dis 	 s 	 ent 	 	is	about	 recogn 	 izing 	 	the	value	of	 disagree 	 ment 	 	,	 dis 	 cord 	 	and	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
but	we	need	to	go	even	further	.
we	need	to	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	 re 	 define 	 	who	it	is	that	 expert 	 s 	 	are	.
the	 convention 	 al 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	is	that	 expert 	 s 	 	are	people	with	 advance 	 d 	 	 degree 	 s 	 	,	 f 	 ancy 	 	 title 	 s 	 	,	 diploma 	 s 	 	,	best	-	selling	 book 	 s 	 	--	high	-	 stat 	 us 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	.
