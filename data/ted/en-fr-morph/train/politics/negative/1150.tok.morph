i	'm	used	to	 think 	 ing 	 	of	the	ted	audience	 a 	 s 	 	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 collect 	 ion 	 	of	some	of	the	most	effective	,	intelligent	,	intellectual	,	savvy	,	 world 	 ly 	 	and	 innov 	 ative 	 	people	in	the	world	.
and	i	think	that	's	true	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	i	 al 	 so 	 	have	reason	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 man 	 y 	 	,	if	not	most	,	of	you	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ty 	 ing 	 	your	 shoe 	 s 	 	 in 	 correct 	 ly 	 	.
now	i	know	that	 seem 	 s 	 	 ludicr 	 ous 	 	.
i	know	that	 seem 	 s 	 	 ludicr 	 ous 	 	.
and	 believ 	 e 	 	me	,	i	lived	the	same	 s 	 ad 	 	life	 un 	 til 	 	about	three	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.	and	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	me	was	i	 b 	 ought 	 	,	what	was	for	me	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	expensive	pair	of	 shoe 	 s 	 	.
but	 t 	 hose 	 	 shoe 	 s 	 	came	with	round	nylon	 lace 	 s 	 	,	and	i	could	n't	keep	them	 ti 	 ed 	 	.
so	i	went	back	to	the	store	and	 s 	 aid 	 	to	the	owner	,	``	i	love	the	 shoe 	 s 	 	,	but	i	hate	the	 lace 	 s 	 	.	``
he	took	a	look	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	oh	,	you	're	 ty 	 ing 	 	them	wrong	.	``
now	up	 un 	 til 	 	that	moment	,	i	would	have	thought	that	,	by	age	50	,	one	of	the	life	 skill 	 s 	 	that	i	had	 re 	 ally 	 	 nail 	 ed 	 	was	 ty 	 ing 	 	my	 shoe 	 s 	 	.
but	not	so	--	let	me	 demonst 	 rate 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	way	that	most	of	us	 we 	 re 	 	taught	to	tie	our	 shoe 	 s 	 	.
now	 a 	 s 	 	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	--	thank	you	.
wait	,	there	's	more	.
 a 	 s 	 	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	there	's	a	strong	form	and	a	weak	form	of	 th 	 is 	 	knot	,	and	we	 we 	 re 	 	taught	to	tie	the	weak	form	.	and	here	's	how	to	tell	.
if	you	pull	the	 strand 	 s 	 	at	the	base	of	the	knot	,	you	will	see	that	the	bow	will	orient	 it 	 self 	 	down	the	long	axis	of	the	shoe	.
that	's	the	weak	form	of	the	knot	.
but	not	to	worry	.
if	we	start	over	and	 simpl 	 y 	 	go	the	other	direction	around	the	bow	,	we	get	 th 	 is 	 	,	the	strong	form	of	the	knot	.
and	if	you	pull	the	 cord 	 s 	 	under	the	knot	,	you	will	see	that	the	bow	 orient 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	 a 	 long 	 	the	 trans 	 verse 	 	axis	of	the	shoe	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 strong 	 er 	 	knot	.	it	will	come	 untie 	 d 	 	less	often	.
it	will	let	you	down	less	,
and	not	 on 	 ly 	 	that	,	it	 look 	 s 	 	better	.
we	're	going	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	one	more	time	.
start	 a 	 s 	 	usual	,	go	the	other	way	around	the	loop	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	little	hard	for	children	,	but	i	think	you	can	handle	it	.
pull	the	knot	.
there	it	is	:	the	strong	form	of	the	shoe	knot	.
now	,	in	 keep 	 ing 	 	with	 to 	 day 	 	's	theme	,	i	'd	like	to	point	out	--	and	 some 	 thing 	 	you	 al 	 ready 	 	know	--	that	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	a	small	advantage	 some 	 place 	 	in	life	can	yield	tremendous	 result 	 s 	 	 some 	 place 	 	else	.
live	long	and	prosper	.
