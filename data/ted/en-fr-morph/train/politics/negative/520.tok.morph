when	i	was	five	 year 	 s 	 	old	i	fell	in	love	with	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	.
now	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	'30s	.
in	the	'30s	an	 air 	 plane 	 	had	two	 wing 	 s 	 	and	a	round	motor	,
and	was	 al 	 ways 	 	 flow 	 n 	 	by	a	guy	who	 look 	 ed 	 	like	cary	grant	.
he	had	high	leather	 boot 	 s 	 	,	jodhpurs	,	an	old	leather	jacket	,	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	helmet	and	 t 	 hose 	 	 marvel 	 ous 	 	 go 	 gg 	 les 	 	--	and	,	 inevit 	 ably 	 	,	a	white	 scar 	 f 	 	,	to	flow	in	the	wind	.
he	'd	 al 	 ways 	 	walk	up	to	his	 air 	 plane 	 	in	a	kind	of	saunter	,	devil	-	may	-	care	saunter	,	flick	the	 cigar 	 ette 	 	away	,	grab	the	girl	 wait 	 ing 	 	here	,	give	her	a	kiss	.
and	then	mount	his	 air 	 plane 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	for	the	last	time	.
of	course	i	 al 	 ways 	 	 wonder 	 ed 	 	what	would	happen	if	he	'd	 kiss 	 ed 	 	the	 air 	 plane 	 	first	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	was	real	 rom 	 ance 	 	to	me	.
 every 	 thing 	 	about	 fly 	 ing 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 year 	 s 	 	,	which	was	--	you	have	to	stop	and	think	for	a	moment	--	was	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	most	 advance 	 d 	 	 techno 	 logical 	 	thing	going	on	at	the	time	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	a	 young 	 ster 	 	,	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	get	close	to	 th 	 is 	 	by	 draw 	 ing 	 	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	,	 constant 	 ly 	 	 draw 	 ing 	 	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	.
it	's	the	way	i	got	a	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	 rom 	 ance 	 	.
and	of	course	,	in	a	way	,	when	i	say	 rom 	 ance 	 	,	i	mean	in	part	the	 aesthetic 	 s 	 	of	that	whole	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
i	think	the	word	is	the	 hol 	 istic 	 	experience	 r 	 evolv 	 ing 	 	around	a	product	.
the	product	was	that	 air 	 plane 	 	.
but	it	built	a	 rom 	 ance 	 	.
even	the	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	 air 	 plane 	 	had	french	 name 	 s 	 	.
ze	 fuse 	 l 	 age 	 	,	ze	 em 	 pan 	 age 	 	,	ze	 ness 	 al 	 	.	you	know	,	from	a	 rom 	 ance 	 	language	.
so	that	it	was	 some 	 thing 	 	that	just	got	 in 	 to 	 	your	spirit	.
it	did	mine	.
and	i	 decide 	 d 	 	i	had	to	get	 close 	 r 	 	than	just	 draw 	 ing 	 	 fanta 	 s 	 y 	 	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	build	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	.
so	i	built	model	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	.
and	i	found	that	in	 do 	 ing 	 	the	model	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	the	 appear 	 ance 	 	 draw 	 ing 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	not	 en 	 ough 	 	.
you	could	n't	transfer	 t 	 hose 	 	to	the	model	 it 	 self 	 	.
if	you	 want 	 ed 	 	it	to	fly	you	had	to	learn	the	discipline	of	 fly 	 ing 	 	.
you	had	to	learn	about	 aeronautic 	 s 	 	.
you	had	to	learn	what	made	an	 air 	 plane 	 	stay	in	the	air	.
and	of	course	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	model	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 year 	 s 	 	,	you	could	n't	control	it	.
so	it	had	to	be	self	-	 right 	 ing 	 	,	and	stay	up	 with 	 out 	 	 crash 	 ing 	 	.
so	i	had	to	give	up	the	approach	of	 draw 	 ing 	 	the	 fanta 	 s 	 y 	 	 shape 	 s 	 	and	convert	it	to	technical	 draw 	 ing 	 s 	 	--
the	shape	of	the	wing	,	the	shape	of	the	 fuse 	 l 	 age 	 	and	so	on	--
and	build	an	 air 	 plane 	 	over	these	 draw 	 ing 	 s 	 	that	i	 k 	 new 	 	 follow 	 ed 	 	some	of	the	 principle 	 s 	 	of	 fly 	 ing 	 	.
and	in	so	 do 	 ing 	 	,	i	could	produce	a	model	that	would	fly	,	stay	in	the	air	.
and	it	had	,	once	it	was	in	the	air	,	some	of	 th 	 is 	 	 rom 	 ance 	 	that	i	was	in	love	with	.
well	the	act	of	 draw 	 ing 	 	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	led	me	to	,	when	i	had	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	 choos 	 e 	 	a	course	in	school	,	led	me	to	sign	up	for	 aeronautic 	 al 	 	 engineer 	 ing 	 	.
and	when	i	was	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	 class 	 es 	 	--	in	which	no	one	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	to	draw	an	 air 	 plane 	 	--	to	my	surprise	.
i	had	to	learn	 mathematic 	 s 	 	and	 mechanic 	 s 	 	and	all	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	thing	.
i	'd	 w 	 ile 	 	away	my	time	 draw 	 ing 	 	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	in	the	class	.
one	day	a	young	man	 look 	 ed 	 	over	my	shoulder	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	draw	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.
you	should	be	in	the	art	 depart 	 ment 	 	.	``	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	why	?	``
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	for	one	thing	,	there	are	more	 girl 	 s 	 	there	.	``
so	my	 rom 	 ance 	 	was	 tempor 	 arily 	 	 shift 	 ed 	 	.
and	i	went	 in 	 to 	 	art	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 appreciate 	 d 	 	 draw 	 ing 	 	.
 stud 	 ied 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 	;	did	n't	do	 ver 	 y 	 	well	at	that	.
went	through	design	,	some	 architect 	 ure 	 	.
 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 hire 	 d 	 	 my 	 self 	 	out	 a 	 s 	 	a	 design 	 er 	 	.
and	for	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	25	 year 	 s 	 	,	living	in	italy	,	living	in	america	,	i	 do 	 led 	 	out	a	piece	of	 th 	 is 	 	 rom 	 ance 	 	to	 any 	 body 	 	who	'd	pay	for	it	--
 th 	 is 	 	sense	,	 th 	 is 	 	aesthetic	 feel 	 ing 	 	,	for	the	experience	 r 	 evolv 	 ing 	 	around	a	designed	object	.
and	it	 exist 	 s 	 	.
any	of	you	who	 rod 	 e 	 	the	 auto 	 mobile 	 s 	 	--	was	it	 yester 	 day 	 	?	--	at	the	track	,	you	know	the	 rom 	 ance 	 	 r 	 evolv 	 ing 	 	around	 t 	 hose 	 	high	performance	 car 	 s 	 	.
well	in	25	 year 	 s 	 	i	was	 most 	 ly 	 	 put 	 ting 	 	out	 piece 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 rom 	 ance 	 	and	not	 get 	 ting 	 	a	lot	back	in	 be 	 cause 	 	design	on	call	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	connect	you	with	a	 circum 	 stance 	 	in	which	you	can	produce	 thing 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	nature	.
so	after	25	 year 	 s 	 	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	feel	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	i	was	running	dry	.
and	i	quit	.
and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	up	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	operation	--	went	from	40	people	to	one	,	in	an	effort	to	 re 	 discover 	 	my	 innoc 	 ence 	 	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	get	back	where	the	 rom 	 ance 	 	was	.
and	i	could	n't	 choos 	 e 	 	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	had	gotten	sort	of	 un 	 romantic 	 	at	that	point	,
even	 th 	 ough 	 	i	'd	 d 	 one 	 	a	lot	of	 air 	 plane 	 	work	,	on	the	 in 	 terior 	 s 	 	.
so	i	chose	furniture	.
and	i	chose	 chair 	 s 	 	 specific 	 ally 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 k 	 new 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	about	them	.
i	'd	designed	a	lot	of	 chair 	 s 	 	,	over	the	 year 	 s 	 	for	 tract 	 ors 	 	and	 truck 	 s 	 	and	 sub 	 marine 	 s 	 	--
all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
but	not	 off 	 ice 	 	 chair 	 s 	 	.
so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	that	.
and	i	found	that	there	 we 	 re 	 	ways	to	 duplic 	 ate 	 	the	same	approach	that	i	used	to	use	on	the	 air 	 plane 	 	.
 on 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	time	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	the	product	 be 	 ing 	 	shaped	by	the	wind	,	it	was	shaped	by	the	human	body	.
so	the	discipline	was	--	 a 	 s 	 	in	the	 air 	 plane 	 	you	learn	a	lot	about	how	to	deal	with	the	air	,	for	a	chair	you	have	to	learn	a	lot	about	how	to	deal	with	the	body	,
and	what	the	body	 need 	 s 	 	,	 want 	 s 	 	,	 indic 	 ates 	 	it	 need 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	the	way	,	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	after	some	 up 	 s 	 	and	 down 	 s 	 	,	i	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 design 	 ing 	 	the	chair	i	'm	going	to	show	you	.
i	should	say	one	more	thing	.	when	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	model	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	,	i	did	 every 	 thing 	 	.
i	 conceiv 	 ed 	 	the	kind	of	 air 	 plane 	 	.
i	 bas 	 ically 	 	engineered	it	.
i	built	it	.
and	i	flew	it	.
and	that	's	the	way	i	work	now	.
when	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	chair	it	was	not	a	 pre 	 conceiv 	 ed 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	.
design	 now 	 a 	 day 	 s 	 	,	if	you	mean	it	,	you	do	n't	start	with	 styl 	 ing 	 	 sketch 	 es 	 	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	with	a	lot	of	loose	 idea 	 s 	 	,
 rough 	 ly 	 	eight	or	nine	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	the	loose	 idea 	 s 	 	had	 some 	 thing 	 	to	do	with	what	i	 k 	 new 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	with	people	in	the	 off 	 ice 	 	,
at	the	work	place	--	people	who	 work 	 ed 	 	,	and	used	task	 s 	 eating 	 	,	a	great	 man 	 y 	 	of	them	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	front	of	a	computer	all	day	long	.
and	i	felt	,	the	one	thing	they	do	n't	need	,	is	a	chair	that	 interfere 	 s 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	main	reason	for	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	.
so	i	took	the	approach	that	the	chair	should	do	 a 	 s 	 	much	for	them	 a 	 s 	 	 human 	 ly 	 	possible	or	 a 	 s 	 	 mechan 	 istically 	 	possible	so	that	they	did	n't	have	to	 fu 	 s 	 s 	 	with	it	.
so	my	idea	was	that	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	down	and	 reach 	 ing 	 	for	a	lot	of	 control 	 s 	 	,	that	you	would	 s 	 it 	 	on	the	chair	,	and	it	would	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	balance	your	weight	against	the	force	 requir 	 ed 	 	to	recline	.
now	that	may	not	mean	a	lot	to	some	of	you	.
but	you	know	most	good	 chair 	 s 	 	do	recline	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 benefici 	 al 	 	to	open	up	 th 	 is 	 	joint	between	your	 leg 	 s 	 	and	your	upper	body	for	better	 breath 	 ing 	 	and	better	flow	.
so	that	if	you	 s 	 it 	 	down	on	my	chair	,	 whet 	 her 	 	you	're	five	feet	tall	or	six	foot	six	,	it	 al 	 ways 	 	 deal 	 s 	 	with	your	weight	and	 transfer 	 s 	 	the	amount	of	force	 requir 	 ed 	 	to	recline	in	a	way	that	you	do	n't	have	to	look	for	 some 	 thing 	 	to	adjust	.
i	'll	tell	you	right	up	front	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	trade	off	.
there	are	 draw 	 back 	 s 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
one	is	:	you	ca	n't	 accommo 	 date 	 	 every 	 body 	 	.
there	are	some	 ver 	 y 	 	light	people	,
some	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	heavy	people	,
 may 	 be 	 	people	with	a	lot	of	bulk	up	top	.
they	begin	to	fall	off	the	end	of	your	chart	.
but	the	 com 	 promise 	 	,	i	felt	,	was	in	my	favor	 be 	 cause 	 	most	people	do	n't	adjust	 the 	 ir 	 	 chair 	 s 	 	.
they	will	 s 	 it 	 	in	them	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
i	had	 some 	 body 	 	on	the	bus	out	to	the	 race 	 track 	 	tell	me	about	his	sister	 call 	 ing 	 	him	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	she	had	one	of	the	new	,	better	 chair 	 s 	 	.
she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	oh	i	love	it	.	``
she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	but	it	's	too	high	.	``
so	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	i	'll	come	over	and	look	at	it	.	``
he	came	over	and	 look 	 ed 	 	at	it	.
he	 reach 	 ed 	 	down	.	he	 pull 	 ed 	 	a	lever	.	and	the	chair	 s 	 an 	 k 	 	down	.
she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	oh	it	's	 wonder 	 ful 	 	.	how	did	you	do	that	?	``
and	he	 show 	 ed 	 	her	the	lever	.
well	,	that	's	typical	of	a	lot	of	us	 work 	 ing 	 	in	 chair 	 s 	 	.
and	why	should	you	get	a	20	-	page	manual	about	how	to	run	a	chair	?
i	had	one	for	a	 wrist 	 watch 	 	once	.	20	 page 	 s 	 	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	i	felt	that	it	was	 import 	 ant 	 	that	you	did	n't	have	to	make	an	 adjust 	 ment 	 	in	order	to	get	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	action	.
the	other	thing	i	felt	was	that	 arm 	 rest 	 s 	 	had	never	 re 	 ally 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 proper 	 ly 	 	 approach 	 ed 	 
from	the	 stand 	 point 	 	of	how	much	of	an	aid	they	could	be	to	your	work	life	.
but	i	felt	it	was	too	much	to	ask	to	have	to	adjust	each	individual	 arm 	 rest 	 	in	order	to	get	it	where	you	 want 	 ed 	 	.
so	i	 s 	 pent 	 	a	long	time	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	i	 work 	 ed 	 	eight	or	nine	 year 	 s 	 	on	it	.
and	each	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	went	 a 	 long 	 	sort	of	in	parallel	but	 increment 	 ally 	 	 we 	 re 	 	a	problem	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	.
i	 work 	 ed 	 	a	long	time	on	 figur 	 ing 	 	out	how	to	move	the	 arm 	 s 	 	over	a	much	 great 	 er 	 	arc	--	that	is	up	and	down	--	and	make	them	a	lot	 eas 	 ier 	 	,	so	that	you	did	n't	have	to	use	a	button	.
and	so	after	 man 	 y 	 	 trial 	 s 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 failure 	 s 	 	,	we	came	up	with	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 arrange 	 ment 	 	in	which	we	could	just	move	one	arm	or	the	other	.
and	they	go	up	 eas 	 ily 	 	.
and	stop	where	you	want	.
you	can	put	them	down	,	 essential 	 ly 	 	out	of	the	way	.
no	 arm 	 s 	 	at	all	.
or	you	can	pull	them	up	where	you	want	them	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	 an 	 other 	 	thing	that	i	felt	,
while	not	 near 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	romantic	 a 	 s 	 	cary	grant	,	 never 	 the 	 less 	 	 begin 	 s 	 	to	grab	a	little	bit	of	aesthetic	operation	,	aesthetic	performance	 in 	 to 	 	a	product	.
the	next	area	that	was	of	interest	to	me	was	the	fact	that	 re 	 c 	 lining 	 	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	factor	.
and	the	more	you	can	recline	,	in	a	way	,	the	better	it	is	.
the	more	the	angle	between	here	and	here	 open 	 s 	 	up	--	and	 now 	 a 	 day 	 s 	 	,	with	a	screen	in	front	of	you	,	you	do	n't	want	to	have	your	eye	drop	too	far	in	the	recline	,	so	we	keep	it	at	more	or	less	the	same	level	--	but	you	transfer	weight	off	your	 tail 	 bone 	 s 	 	.
would	 every 	 body 	 	put	 the 	 ir 	 	hand	under	 the 	 ir 	 	bottom	and	feel	 the 	 ir 	 	 tail 	 bone 	 	?
you	feel	that	bone	under	there	?
just	your	own	.
there	's	two	of	them	,	one	on	either	side	.
all	the	weight	of	your	upper	 tors 	 o 	 	--	your	 arm 	 s 	 	,	your	head	--	 go 	 es 	 	right	down	through	your	back	,	your	 s 	 pine 	 	,	 in 	 to 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 bone 	 s 	 	when	you	 s 	 it 	 	.
and	that	's	a	lot	of	load	.
just	 reliev 	 ing 	 	your	 arm 	 s 	 	with	 arm 	 rest 	 s 	 	 take 	 s 	 	20	percent	of	that	load	off	.
now	that	,	if	your	 s 	 pine 	 	is	not	held	in	a	good	position	,	will	help	bend	your	 s 	 pine 	 	the	wrong	way	,	and	so	on	.
so	to	 un 	 load 	 	that	great	weight	--	if	that	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	 exist 	 s 	 	--	you	can	recline	.
when	you	recline	you	take	away	a	lot	of	that	load	off	your	bottom	end	,	and	transfer	it	to	your	back	.
at	the	same	time	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	say	,	you	open	up	 th 	 is 	 	joint	.
and	 breath 	 ability 	 	is	good	.
but	to	do	that	,	if	you	have	any	amount	of	recline	,	it	 get 	 s 	 	to	the	point	where	you	need	a	 head 	 rest 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 near 	 ly 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	,	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	hold	your	head	in	a	 vert 	 ical 	 	position	,	see	?
 a 	 s 	 	i	recline	,	my	head	 say 	 s 	 	more	or	less	 vert 	 ical 	 	.
well	if	you	're	 recline 	 d 	 	a	great	deal	,	you	have	to	use	muscle	force	to	hold	your	head	there	.
so	that	's	where	a	 head 	 rest 	 	 come 	 s 	 	in	.
now	 head 	 rest 	 	is	a	 challeng 	 e 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	you	want	it	to	adjust	 en 	 ough 	 	so	that	it	'll	fit	,	you	know	,	a	tall	guy	and	a	short	girl	.
so	here	we	are	.
i	've	got	five	 inch 	 es 	 	of	 adjust 	 ment 	 	here	in	order	to	get	the	 head 	 rest 	 	in	the	right	place	.
but	then	i	 k 	 new 	 	from	experience	and	looking	around	in	 off 	 ice 	 s 	 	where	there	 we 	 re 	 	 chair 	 s 	 	with	 head 	 rest 	 s 	 	that	 no 	 body 	 	would	ever	 both 	 er 	 	to	reach	back	and	turn	a	knob	and	adjust	the	 head 	 rest 	 	to	put	it	in	position	.
and	you	need	it	in	a	different	position	when	you	're	 up 	 right 	 	,	then	when	you	're	 recline 	 d 	 	.
so	i	 k 	 new 	 	that	had	to	be	 solve 	 d 	 	,	and	had	to	be	 autom 	 atic 	 	.
so	if	you	watch	 th 	 is 	 	chair	 a 	 s 	 	i	recline	,	the	 head 	 rest 	 	 come 	 s 	 	up	to	meet	my	neck	.
 ideal 	 ly 	 	you	want	to	put	the	head	support	in	the	cranial	area	,	right	there	.
so	that	part	of	it	took	a	long	time	to	work	out	.
and	there	is	a	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	other	 thing 	 s 	 	:	the	shape	of	the	 cushion 	 s 	 	,
the	gel	we	put	.	we	stole	the	idea	from	 bi 	 cycle 	 	 seat 	 s 	 	,	and	put	gel	in	the	 cushion 	 s 	 	and	in	the	 arm 	 rest 	 s 	 	to	absorb	point	load	--	 distribut 	 es 	 	the	 load 	 ing 	 	so	you	do	n't	get	hard	 spot 	 s 	 	.
you	cant	hit	your	elbow	on	bottom	.
