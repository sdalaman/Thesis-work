i	'm	a	writer	and	a	journalist	,	and	i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	an	 insan 	 e 	 ly 	 	 cur 	 ious 	 	person	,
so	in	22	 year 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	journalist	,	i	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	how	to	do	a	lot	of	new	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	three	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	how	to	do	was	to	 be 	 come 	 	 in 	 visible 	 	.
i	 be 	 came 	 	one	of	the	 work 	 ing 	 	 home 	 less 	 	.
i	quit	my	job	 a 	 s 	 	a	 news 	 paper 	 	editor	after	my	father	 di 	 ed 	 	in	february	of	that	same	year	,	and	 decide 	 d 	 	to	travel	.
his	death	hit	me	 pre 	 tty 	 	hard	.
and	there	 we 	 re 	 	a	lot	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	feel	and	deal	with	while	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	that	.
i	've	 camp 	 ed 	 	my	whole	life	.	and	i	 decide 	 d 	 	that	living	in	a	van	for	a	year	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	would	be	like	one	long	 camp 	 ing 	 	trip	.
so	i	 pack 	 ed 	 	my	cat	,	my	rottweiler	and	my	 camp 	 ing 	 	gear	 in 	 to 	 	a	1975	chevy	van	,	and	drove	off	 in 	 to 	 	the	 s 	 un 	 set 	 	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	fully	 fail 	 ed 	 	to	 real 	 ize 	 	three	critical	 thing 	 s 	 	.
one	:	that	 socie 	 ty 	 	 equate 	 s 	 	living	in	a	permanent	structure	,	even	a	 s 	 hack 	 	,	with	 hav 	 ing 	 	value	 a 	 s 	 	a	person	.
two	:	i	 fail 	 ed 	 	to	 real 	 ize 	 	how	 quick 	 ly 	 	the	negative	 per 	 ception 	 s 	 	of	other	people	can	impact	our	 re 	 ality 	 	,	if	we	let	it	.
three	:	i	 fail 	 ed 	 	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	 home 	 lessness 	 	is	an	attitude	,	not	a	 life 	 style 	 	.
at	first	,	living	in	the	van	was	great	.
i	 shower 	 ed 	 	in	 camp 	 ground 	 s 	 	.	i	ate	out	 regular 	 ly 	 	.
and	i	had	time	to	relax	and	to	 griev 	 e 	 	.
but	then	the	anger	and	the	 depress 	 ion 	 	about	my	father	's	death	set	in	.	my	 free 	 lance 	 	job	 end 	 ed 	 	.	and	i	had	to	get	a	full	-	time	job	to	pay	the	 bill 	 s 	 	.
what	had	 be 	 en 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	mild	spring	 turn 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 mis 	 er 	 ably 	 	hot	summer	.
and	it	 be 	 came 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	to	park	 any 	 where 	 	--	--	 with 	 out 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	obvious	that	i	had	a	cat	and	a	dog	with	me	,	and	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	hot	.
the	cat	came	and	went	through	an	open	window	in	the	van	.
the	 dog 	 gy 	 	went	 in 	 to 	 	 dog 	 gy 	 	day	care	.
and	i	 sweat 	 ed 	 	.
 when 	 ever 	 	i	could	,	i	used	 employ 	 ee 	 	 shower 	 s 	 	in	 off 	 ice 	 	 building 	 s 	 	and	truck	 stop 	 s 	 	.	or	i	 wash 	 ed 	 	up	in	public	rest	rooms	.
 night 	 time 	 	 temperature 	 s 	 	in	the	van	 rare 	 ly 	 	 drop 	 ped 	 	 be 	 low 	 	80	 degree 	 s 	 	fahrenheit	,	making	it	difficult	or	 im 	 possible 	 	to	sleep	.
food	 rot 	 ted 	 	in	the	heat	.
ice	in	my	ice	chest	 melt 	 ed 	 	 with 	 in 	 	 hour 	 s 	 	,	and	it	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	 mis 	 er 	 able 	 	.
i	could	n't	afford	to	find	an	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	,	or	could	n't	afford	an	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	that	would	allow	me	to	have	the	rottweiler	and	the	cat	.
and	i	 re 	 fused 	 	to	give	them	up	,
so	i	 stay 	 ed 	 	in	the	van	.
and	when	the	heat	made	me	too	sick	to	walk	the	50	feet	to	the	public	 rest 	 room 	 	 out 	 side 	 	my	van	at	night	,	i	used	a	 buck 	 et 	 	and	a	trash	bag	 a 	 s 	 	a	toilet	.
when	winter	weather	set	in	,	the	 temperature 	 s 	 	 drop 	 ped 	 	 be 	 low 	 	freezing	.	and	they	 stay 	 ed 	 	there	.
and	i	 face 	 d 	 	a	whole	new	set	of	 challeng 	 es 	 	.
i	 park 	 ed 	 	a	different	place	every	night	so	i	would	avoid	 be 	 ing 	 	 notice 	 d 	 	and	 hassle 	 d 	 	by	the	police	.
i	did	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	succeed	.
but	i	felt	out	of	control	of	my	life	.
and	i	do	n't	know	when	or	how	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	but	the	speed	at	which	i	went	from	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 talent 	 ed 	 	writer	and	journalist	to	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 home 	 less 	 	woman	,	living	in	a	van	,	took	my	breath	away	.
i	had	n't	 change 	 d 	 	.	my	i.q	.	had	n't	 drop 	 ped 	 	.
my	talent	,	my	 integ 	 r 	 ity 	 	,	my	 value 	 s 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	about	me	 remain 	 ed 	 	the	same	.
but	i	had	 change 	 d 	 	 some 	 how 	 	.
i	 spiral 	 ed 	 	 deep 	 er 	 	and	 deep 	 er 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 depress 	 ion 	 	.
and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 some 	 one 	 	 refer 	 red 	 	me	to	a	 home 	 less 	 	health	clinic	.
and	i	went	.	i	had	n't	 bath 	 ed 	 	in	three	 day 	 s 	 	.
i	was	 a 	 s 	 	 smell 	 y 	 	and	 a 	 s 	 	 depress 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 any 	 one 	 	in	line	.
i	just	was	n't	drunk	or	high	.
and	when	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	of	the	 home 	 less 	 	men	 real 	 ized 	 	that	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	a	 form 	 er 	 	university	professor	,	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	are	n't	 home 	 less 	 	.	why	are	you	 re 	 ally 	 	here	?	``
other	 home 	 less 	 	people	did	n't	see	me	 a 	 s 	 	 home 	 less 	 	,	but	i	did	.
then	the	professor	 listen 	 ed 	 	to	my	story	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	have	a	job	.	you	have	hope	.
the	real	 home 	 less 	 	do	n't	have	hope	.	``
a	 re 	 action 	 	to	the	 medic 	 ation 	 	the	clinic	 g 	 ave 	 	me	for	my	 depress 	 ion 	 	left	me	 sui 	 cidal 	 	.	and	i	remember	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	if	i	 kill 	 ed 	 	 my 	 self 	 	,	no	one	would	notice	.	``
a	friend	told	me	,	 short 	 ly 	 	after	that	,	that	she	had	heard	that	tim	russert	,	a	 national 	 ly 	 	 ren 	 owned 	 	journalist	,	had	 be 	 en 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	me	on	national	t.v	.
an	essay	i	'd	written	about	my	father	,	the	year	before	he	 di 	 ed 	 	,	was	in	tim	's	new	book	.
and	he	was	 do 	 ing 	 	the	talk	show	circuit	.	and	he	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	my	writing	.
and	when	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	tim	russert	,	 form 	 er 	 	 mode 	 rator 	 	of	``	meet	the	press	,	``	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	my	writing	,	while	i	was	living	in	a	van	in	a	wal	-	mart	 park 	 ing 	 	lot	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 laugh 	 ing 	 	.
you	should	too	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	 laugh 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	got	to	the	point	where	,	was	i	a	writer	,	or	was	i	a	 home 	 less 	 	woman	?
so	i	went	in	the	 book 	 store 	 	.	and	i	found	tim	's	book	.
and	i	stood	there	.	and	i	 re 	 read 	 	my	essay	.
and	i	 cri 	 ed 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	a	writer	.
i	was	a	writer	.
 short 	 ly 	 	after	that	i	 move 	 d 	 	back	to	tennessee	.
i	 alternate 	 d 	 	between	living	in	a	van	and	couch	surfing	with	 friend 	 s 	 	.
and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	writing	 aga 	 in 	 	.
by	the	summer	of	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	year	i	was	a	 work 	 ing 	 	journalist	.
i	was	winning	 a 	 ward 	 s 	 	.	i	was	living	in	my	own	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	.
i	was	no	 long 	 er 	 	 home 	 less 	 	.
and	i	was	no	 long 	 er 	 	 in 	 visible 	 	.
 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	work	full	and	part	-	time	 job 	 s 	 	,	and	live	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 car 	 s 	 	.
but	 socie 	 ty 	 	 continu 	 es 	 	to	 stigma 	 tize 	 	and	 criminal 	 ize 	 	living	in	your	vehicle	or	on	the	 street 	 s 	 	.
so	the	 home 	 less 	 	,	the	 work 	 ing 	 	 home 	 less 	 	,	 prim 	 arily 	 	remain	 in 	 visible 	 	.
but	if	you	ever	meet	one	,	engage	them	,	 encourag 	 e 	 	them	,	and	 off 	 er 	 	them	hope	.
the	human	spirit	can	 over 	 come 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	if	it	 ha 	 s 	 	hope	.
and	i	'm	not	here	to	be	the	 post 	 er 	 	girl	for	the	 home 	 less 	 	.
i	'm	not	here	to	 encourag 	 e 	 	you	to	give	money	to	the	next	 pan 	 handler 	 	you	meet	.
but	i	am	here	to	tell	you	that	,	based	on	my	experience	,	people	are	not	where	they	live	,	where	they	sleep	,	or	what	 the 	 ir 	 	life	 situ 	 ation 	 	is	at	any	 give 	 n 	 	time	.
three	 year 	 s 	 	ago	i	was	living	in	a	van	in	a	wal	-	mart	 park 	 ing 	 	lot	,
and	 to 	 day 	 	i	'm	 s 	 peaking 	 	at	ted	.
hope	 al 	 ways 	 	,	 al 	 ways 	 	 find 	 s 	 	a	way	.	thank	you	.
