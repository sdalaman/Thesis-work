i	'm	a	cancer	doctor	,	and	i	 walk 	 ed 	 	out	of	my	 off 	 ice 	 	and	 walk 	 ed 	 	by	the	 pharma 	 cy 	 	in	the	hospital	three	or	four	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	cover	of	fortune	magazine	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	the	window	of	the	 pharma 	 cy 	 	.
and	so	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	cancer	doctor	,	you	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	you	get	a	little	bit	 down 	 hearted 	 	.
but	when	you	start	to	read	the	article	by	cliff	,	who	 him 	 self 	 	is	a	cancer	 surviv 	 or 	 	,	who	was	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	by	a	 clinic 	 al 	 	trial
where	his	 parent 	 s 	 	drove	him	from	new	york	city	to	 up 	 state 	 	new	york	to	get	an	 experiment 	 al 	 	therapy	for	--	at	the	time	--	hodgkin	's	disease	,	which	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	his	life	,
he	 make 	 s 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	 point 	 s 	 	here	.
and	the	point	of	the	article	was	that	we	have	gotten	 r 	 eduction 	 ist 	 	in	our	view	of	biology	,	in	our	view	of	cancer	.
for	the	last	50	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	have	focused	on	 treat 	 ing 	 	the	individual	gene	in	 understand 	 ing 	 	cancer	,	not	in	 controll 	 ing 	 	cancer	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 astound 	 ing 	 	table	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 sober 	 s 	 	us	in	our	field	 every 	 day 	 	in	that	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	we	've	made	 remark 	 able 	 	 impact 	 s 	 	on	 cardio 	 vascular 	 	disease	,
but	look	at	cancer	.	the	death	rate	in	cancer	in	over	50	 year 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 change 	 d 	 	.
we	've	made	small	 win 	 s 	 	in	 disease 	 s 	 	like	chronic	 myel 	 o 	 genous 	 	leukemia	,	where	we	have	a	pill	that	can	put	100	percent	of	people	in	 re 	 mission 	 	,
but	in	general	,	we	have	n't	made	an	impact	at	all	in	the	war	on	cancer	.
so	,	what	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	 to 	 day 	 	,	is	a	little	bit	of	why	i	think	that	's	the	case	,	and	then	go	out	of	my	comfort	zone	and	tell	you	where	i	think	it	's	going	,	where	a	new	approach	--	that	we	hope	to	push	forward	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 treat 	 ing 	 	cancer	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	wrong	.
so	,	what	is	cancer	,	first	of	all	?
well	,	if	one	 ha 	 s 	 	a	mass	or	an	 ab 	 normal 	 	blood	value	,	you	go	to	a	doctor	,
they	stick	a	needle	in	.
they	way	we	make	the	 diagnos 	 is 	 	 to 	 day 	 	is	by	pattern	 re 	 cognition 	 	:
 do 	 es 	 	it	look	normal	?	 do 	 es 	 	it	look	 ab 	 normal 	 	?
so	,	that	 patho 	 logist 	 	is	just	like	looking	at	 th 	 is 	 	plastic	bottle	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	normal	cell	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	cancer	cell	.
that	is	the	state	-	of	-	the	-	art	 to 	 day 	 	in	 diagnos 	 ing 	 	cancer	.
there	's	no	 mole 	 cular 	 	test	,
there	's	no	 s 	 equ 	 encing 	 	of	 gene 	 s 	 	that	was	 refer 	 red 	 	to	 yester 	 day 	 	,
there	's	no	 f 	 ancy 	 	looking	at	the	 chromosom 	 es 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	state	-	of	-	the	-	art	and	how	we	do	it	.
you	know	,	i	know	 ver 	 y 	 	well	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	cancer	doctor	,	i	ca	n't	treat	 advance 	 d 	 	cancer	.
so	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	 a 	 side 	 	,	i	 firm 	 ly 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	in	the	field	of	 try 	 ing 	 	to	identify	cancer	early	.
it	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	you	can	start	to	fight	cancer	,	is	by	 catch 	 ing 	 	it	early	.
we	can	prevent	most	 cancer 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	the	previous	talk	 allud 	 ed 	 	to	 prevent 	 ing 	 	heart	disease	.
we	could	do	the	same	in	cancer	.
i	co	-	 found 	 ed 	 	a	company	 call 	 ed 	 	navigenics	,	where	,	if	you	 s 	 pit 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	tube	--	and	we	can	look	look	at	35	or	40	genetic	 marker 	 s 	 	for	disease	,	all	of	which	are	 delay 	 able 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 cancer 	 s 	 	--
you	start	to	identify	what	you	could	get	,	and	then	we	can	start	to	work	to	prevent	them	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	problem	is	,	when	you	have	 advance 	 d 	 	cancer	,	we	ca	n't	do	that	much	 to 	 day 	 	about	it	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	 statistic 	 s 	 	 al 	 lude 	 	to	.
so	,	the	thing	about	cancer	is	that	it	's	a	disease	of	the	aged	.
why	is	it	a	disease	of	the	aged	?
 be 	 cause 	 	evolution	 do 	 es 	 	n't	care	about	us	after	we	've	had	our	children	.
see	,	evolution	 protect 	 ed 	 	us	 dur 	 ing 	 	our	 child 	 bear 	 ing 	 	 year 	 s 	 	and	then	,	after	age	35	or	40	or	45	,	it	 s 	 aid 	 	``	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	 any 	 more 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	've	had	 the 	 ir 	 	 pro 	 geny 	 	.	``
so	if	you	look	at	 cancer 	 s 	 	,	it	is	 ver 	 y 	 	rare	--	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	rare	--	to	have	cancer	in	a	child	,	on	the	order	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 case 	 s 	 	a	year	.
 a 	 s 	 	one	 get 	 s 	 	 old 	 er 	 	?	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	common	.
why	is	it	hard	to	treat	?
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	heterogeneous	,	and	that	's	the	perfect	substrate	for	evolution	 with 	 in 	 	the	cancer	.
it	 start 	 s 	 	to	select	out	for	 t 	 hose 	 	bad	,	 aggress 	 ive 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	,	what	we	call	 clon 	 al 	 	 s 	 election 	 	.
but	,	if	we	start	to	understand	that	cancer	is	n't	just	a	 mole 	 cular 	 	defect	,	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	more	,	then	we	'll	get	to	new	ways	of	 treat 	 ing 	 	it	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	'll	show	you	.
so	,	one	of	the	fundamental	 problem 	 s 	 	we	have	in	cancer	is	that	,	right	now	,	we	 de 	 scribe 	 	it	by	a	number	of	 adjective 	 s 	 	,	 symptom 	 s 	 	:
``	i	'm	 tire 	 d 	 	,	i	'm	 bloat 	 ed 	 	,	i	have	pain	,	 etc 	 . 	 	``
you	then	have	some	 an 	 atomic 	 	 de 	 script 	 ions 	 	,
you	get	that	ct	 s 	 can 	 	:	``	there	's	a	three	centimeter	mass	in	the	liver	.	``
you	then	have	some	body	part	 de 	 script 	 ions 	 	:
``	it	's	in	the	liver	,	in	the	breast	,	in	the	 pro 	 state 	 	.	``
and	that	's	about	it	.
so	,	our	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	for	 de 	 s 	 crib 	 ing 	 	cancer	is	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	poor	.
it	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	 symptom 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 manifest 	 ations 	 	of	a	disease	.
what	's	 excit 	 ing 	 	is	that	over	the	last	two	or	three	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	government	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 pent 	 	400	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	and	they	've	 al 	 locate 	 d 	 	 an 	 other 	 	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	to	what	we	call	the	cancer	genome	atlas	project	.
so	,	it	is	the	idea	of	 s 	 equ 	 encing 	 	all	of	the	 gene 	 s 	 	in	the	cancer	,	and	giving	us	a	new	 lexic 	 on 	 	,	a	new	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	it	.
you	know	,	in	the	mid	-	1850	's	in	france	,	they	 start 	 ed 	 	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	cancer	by	body	part	.
that	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 change 	 d 	 	in	over	150	 year 	 s 	 	.
it	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 arch 	 a 	 ic 	 	that	we	call	cancer	by	 pro 	 state 	 	,	by	breast	,	by	muscle	.
it	 make 	 s 	 	no	sense	,	if	you	think	about	it	.
so	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	the	technology	is	here	 to 	 day 	 	,	and	,	over	the	next	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 year 	 s 	 	,	that	will	change	.
you	will	no	 long 	 er 	 	go	to	a	breast	cancer	clinic	.
you	will	go	to	a	her	2	 ampl 	 ified 	 	clinic	,	or	an	egfr	 activate 	 d 	 	clinic	,
and	they	will	go	to	some	of	the	 pathogen 	 ic 	 	 les 	 ions 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 caus 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	individual	cancer	.
so	,	 hope 	 fully 	 	,	we	will	go	from	 be 	 ing 	 	the	art	of	medicine	more	to	the	science	of	medicine	,	and	be	able	to	do	what	they	do	in	 infect 	 ious 	 	disease	,	which	is	look	at	that	organism	,	that	bacteria	,	and	then	say	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	 anti 	 biotic 	 	 make 	 s 	 	sense	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	have	a	 part 	 icular 	 	bacteria	that	will	respond	to	it	.	``
when	one	is	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	to	h	1n1	,	you	take	tamiflu	,	and	you	can	 remark 	 ably 	 	 de 	 crease 	 	the	 s 	 ever 	 ity 	 	of	 symptom 	 s 	 	and	prevent	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 manifest 	 ations 	 	of	the	disease	.
why	?	 be 	 cause 	 	we	know	what	you	have	,	and	we	know	how	to	treat	it	--	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	we	ca	n't	make	 vaccin 	 e 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	,	but	that	's	a	different	story	.
the	cancer	genome	atlas	is	coming	out	now	.
the	first	cancer	was	 d 	 one 	 	,	which	was	brain	cancer	.
in	the	next	month	,	the	end	of	december	,	you	'll	see	 ov 	 arian 	 	cancer	,
and	then	lung	cancer	will	come	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 month 	 s 	 	after	.
there	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	field	of	 proteo 	 mic 	 s 	 	that	i	'll	talk	about	in	a	few	 minute 	 s 	 	,	which	i	think	is	going	to	be	the	next	level	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 understand 	 ing 	 	and	 class 	 ifying 	 	disease	.
but	remember	,	i	'm	not	 push 	 ing 	 	 genomic 	 s 	 	,	 proteo 	 mic 	 s 	 	,	to	be	a	 r 	 eduction 	 ist 	 	.
i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	it	so	we	can	identify	what	we	're	up	against	.
and	there	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 distinct 	 ion 	 	there	that	we	'll	get	to	.
in	health	care	 to 	 day 	 	,	we	 s 	 pend 	 	most	of	the	 dollar 	 s 	 	--	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 treat 	 ing 	 	disease	--
most	of	the	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	the	last	two	 year 	 s 	 	of	a	person	's	life	.
we	 s 	 pend 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	little	,	if	any	,	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 identify 	 ing 	 	what	we	're	up	against	.
if	you	could	start	to	move	that	,	to	identify	what	you	're	up	against	,	you	're	going	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	a	hell	of	a	lot	better	.
if	we	could	even	take	it	one	step	further	and	prevent	disease	,	we	can	take	it	 enormous 	 ly 	 	the	other	direction	,
and	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	that	's	where	we	need	to	go	,	going	forward	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	of	the	national	cancer	institute	.
and	i	'm	here	to	tell	you	,	it	's	wrong	.
so	,	the	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	of	the	national	cancer	institute	 say 	 s 	 	that	cancer	is	a	genetic	disease	.
the	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	if	you	look	,	there	's	an	individual	mutation	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	a	second	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	a	third	,	and	that	is	cancer	.	``
but	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	cancer	doc	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	see	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	a	genetic	disease	.
so	,	there	you	see	,	it	's	a	liver	with	colon	cancer	in	it	,
and	you	see	 in 	 to 	 	the	 micro 	 scope 	 	a	lymph	 no 	 de 	 	where	cancer	 ha 	 s 	 	 invad 	 ed 	 	.
you	see	a	ct	 s 	 can 	 	where	cancer	is	in	the	liver	.
cancer	is	an	 interact 	 ion 	 	of	a	cell	that	no	 long 	 er 	 	is	under	growth	control	with	the	environment	.
it	's	not	in	the	abstract	;	it	's	the	 interact 	 ion 	 	with	the	environment	.
it	's	what	we	call	a	system	.
the	goal	of	me	 a 	 s 	 	a	cancer	doctor	is	not	to	understand	cancer	.
and	i	think	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	the	fundamental	problem	over	the	last	five	 decade 	 s 	 	,	is	that	we	have	 striv 	 ed 	 	to	understand	cancer	.
the	goal	is	to	control	cancer	.
and	that	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	 optim 	 ization 	 	scheme	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	for	all	of	us	.
i	got	up	at	the	american	 associ 	 ation 	 	of	cancer	research	,	one	of	the	big	cancer	research	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	with	20,000	people	there	,
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	've	made	a	 mistak 	 e 	 	.
we	've	all	made	a	 mistak 	 e 	 	,	 my 	 self 	 	 include 	 d 	 	,	by	 focus 	 ing 	 	down	,	by	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 r 	 eduction 	 ist 	 	.
we	need	to	take	a	step	back	.	``
and	,	 believ 	 e 	 	it	or	not	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	 his 	 s 	 es 	 	in	the	audience	.
people	got	 up 	 set 	 	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	we	're	going	to	go	forward	.
you	know	,	i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	fortunate	to	meet	danny	hillis	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 push 	 ed 	 	together	,	and	 n 	 either 	 	one	of	us	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	meet	the	other	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	do	i	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	meet	a	guy	from	disney	,	who	designed	 computer 	 s 	 	?	``
and	he	was	 say 	 ing 	 	:	 do 	 es 	 	he	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	meet	 an 	 other 	 	doctor	?
but	people	 prevail 	 ed 	 	on	us	,	and	we	got	together	,
and	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 transform 	 ative 	 	in	what	i	do	,	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 transform 	 ative 	 	.
we	have	designed	,	and	we	have	 work 	 ed 	 	on	the	 model 	 ing 	 	--	and	much	of	these	 idea 	 s 	 	came	from	danny	and	from	his	team	--	the	 model 	 ing 	 	of	cancer	in	the	body	 a 	 s 	 	complex	system	.
and	i	'll	show	you	some	data	there	where	i	 re 	 ally 	 	think	it	can	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	and	a	new	way	to	approach	it	.
the	key	is	,	when	you	look	at	these	 vari 	 able 	 s 	 	and	you	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	data	,	you	have	to	understand	the	data	 in 	 put 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	if	i	 measur 	 ed 	 	your	temperature	over	30	 day 	 s 	 	,	and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	``	what	was	the	average	temperature	?	``	and	it	came	back	at	98.7	,	i	would	say	,	``	great	.	``
but	if	 dur 	 ing 	 	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 day 	 s 	 	your	temperature	 spike 	 d 	 	to	102	for	six	 hour 	 s 	 	,	and	you	took	tylenol	and	got	better	,	etc	.	,
i	would	 total 	 ly 	 	 mis 	 s 	 	it	.
so	,	one	of	the	 problem 	 s 	 	,	the	fundamental	 problem 	 s 	 	in	medicine	is	that	you	and	i	,	and	all	of	us	,	we	go	to	our	doctor	once	a	year	.
we	have	discrete	data	 element 	 s 	 	;	we	do	n't	have	a	time	function	on	them	.
 ear 	 lier 	 	it	was	 refer 	 red 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	direct	life	 de 	 vice 	 	.
you	know	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	using	it	for	two	and	a	half	 month 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	 stagger 	 ing 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	,	not	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 tell 	 s 	 	me	how	 man 	 y 	 	 kilo 	 calorie 	 s 	 	i	do	every	day	,	but	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 look 	 s 	 	,	over	24	 hour 	 s 	 	,	what	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	in	a	day	.
and	i	did	n't	 real 	 ize 	 	that	for	three	 hour 	 s 	 	i	'm	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	at	my	desk	,	and	i	'm	not	moving	at	all	.
and	a	lot	of	the	 function 	 s 	 	in	the	data	that	we	have	 a 	 s 	 	 in 	 put 	 	 system 	 s 	 	here	are	 re 	 ally 	 	different	than	we	understand	them	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	not	 measur 	 ing 	 	them	 dynamic 	 ally 	 	.
and	so	,	if	you	think	of	cancer	 a 	 s 	 	a	system	,	there	's	an	 in 	 put 	 	and	an	 out 	 put 	 	and	a	state	in	the	middle	.
so	,	the	 state 	 s 	 	,	are	 equi 	 valent 	 	 class 	 es 	 	of	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	and	the	cancer	patient	,	the	 in 	 put 	 	,	is	the	environment	,	the	diet	,	the	 treat 	 ment 	 	,	the	genetic	 mutation 	 s 	 	.
the	 out 	 put 	 	are	our	 symptom 	 s 	 	:
do	we	have	pain	?	is	the	cancer	growing	?	do	we	feel	 bloat 	 ed 	 	,	etc	.	?
most	of	that	state	is	 hid 	 den 	 	.
so	what	we	do	in	our	field	is	we	change	and	 in 	 put 	 	,	we	give	 aggress 	 ive 	 	 chemo 	 therapy 	 	,
and	we	say	,	``	did	that	 out 	 put 	 	get	better	?	did	that	pain	improve	,	etc	.	?	``
and	so	,	the	problem	is	that	it	's	not	just	one	system	,	it	's	 multi 	 ple 	 	 system 	 s 	 	on	 multi 	 ple 	 	 scale 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	system	of	 system 	 s 	 	.
and	so	,	when	you	start	to	look	at	 emerge 	 nt 	 	 system 	 s 	 	,	you	can	look	at	a	 neuro 	 n 	 	under	a	 micro 	 scope 	 	.
a	 neuro 	 n 	 	under	the	 micro 	 scope 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	elegant	with	little	 thing 	 s 	 	 stick 	 ing 	 	out	and	little	 thing 	 s 	 	over	here	,	but	when	you	start	to	put	them	together	in	a	complex	system	,	and	you	start	to	see	that	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	brain	,	and	that	brain	can	create	 intellig 	 ence 	 	,	what	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	in	the	body	,
and	cancer	is	 start 	 ing 	 	to	model	it	like	a	complex	system	.
well	,	the	bad	news	is	that	these	 ro 	 bust 	 	--	and	 ro 	 bust 	 	is	a	key	word	--	 emerge 	 nt 	 	 system 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	understand	in	detail	.
the	good	news	is	you	can	 manipul 	 ate 	 	them	.
you	can	try	to	control	them	 with 	 out 	 	that	fundamental	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	every	component	.
one	of	the	most	fundamental	 clinic 	 al 	 	 trial 	 s 	 	in	cancer	came	out	in	february	in	the	new	england	journal	of	medicine	,	where	they	took	women	who	 we 	 re 	 	pre	-	menopausal	with	breast	cancer	.
so	,	about	the	worst	kind	of	breast	cancer	you	can	get	.
they	had	gotten	 the 	 ir 	 	 chemo 	 therapy 	 	,	and	then	they	 random 	 ized 	 	them	,	where	half	got	 place 	 bo 	 	,	and	half	got	a	drug	 call 	 ed 	 	zoledronic	acid	that	 build 	 s 	 	bone	.
it	's	used	to	treat	 osteo 	 poro 	 sis 	 	,	and	they	got	that	twice	a	year	.
they	 look 	 ed 	 	and	,	in	these	1,800	women	,	 give 	 n 	 	twice	a	year	a	drug	that	 build 	 s 	 	bone	,	you	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	 recur 	 rence 	 	of	cancer	by	35	percent	.
 reduc 	 e 	 	 occur 	 rence 	 	of	cancer	by	a	drug	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	even	touch	the	cancer	.
so	the	 not 	 ion 	 	,	you	change	the	 s 	 oil 	 	,	the	seed	 do 	 es 	 	n't	grow	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
you	change	that	system	,	and	you	could	have	a	 mark 	 ed 	 	effect	on	the	cancer	.
 no 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	 show 	 n 	 	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	will	be	 shock 	 ing 	 	--	 no 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	 show 	 n 	 	that	most	 chemo 	 therapy 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 touch 	 es 	 	a	cancer	cell	.
it	's	never	 be 	 en 	 	 show 	 n 	 	.
there	's	all	these	elegant	work	in	the	tissue	culture	 dish 	 es 	 	,	that	if	you	give	 th 	 is 	 	cancer	drug	,	you	can	do	 th 	 is 	 	effect	to	the	cell	,	but	the	 dose 	 s 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 dish 	 es 	 	are	 no 	 where 	 	near	the	 dose 	 s 	 	that	happen	in	the	body	.
if	i	give	a	woman	with	breast	cancer	a	drug	 call 	 ed 	 	taxol	every	three	 week 	 s 	 	,	which	is	the	standard	,	about	40	percent	of	women	with	 metasta 	 tic 	 	cancer	have	a	great	 respons 	 e 	 	to	that	drug	.
and	a	 respons 	 e 	 	is	50	percent	 shrink 	 age 	 	.
well	,	remember	that	's	not	even	an	order	of	 magn 	 itude 	 	,	but	that	's	a	different	story	.
they	then	recur	,	i	give	them	that	same	drug	every	week	.
 an 	 other 	 	30	percent	will	respond	.
they	then	recur	,	i	give	them	that	same	drug	over	96	 hour 	 s 	 	by	 continu 	 ous 	 	 in 	 fusion 	 	,	 an 	 other 	 	20	or	30	percent	will	respond	.
so	,	you	ca	n't	tell	me	it	's	 work 	 ing 	 	by	the	same	 mechan 	 ism 	 	in	all	three	 s 	 ize 	 	.
it	's	not	.	we	have	no	idea	the	 mechan 	 ism 	 	.
so	the	idea	that	 chemo 	 therapy 	 	may	just	be	 disrupt 	 ing 	 	that	complex	system	,	just	like	building	bone	 disrupt 	 ed 	 	that	system	and	 reduc 	 ed 	 	 recur 	 rence 	 	,	 chemo 	 therapy 	 	may	work	by	that	same	exact	way	.
the	wild	thing	about	that	trial	 al 	 so 	 	,	was	that	it	 reduc 	 ed 	 	new	 prim 	 aries 	 	,	so	new	 cancer 	 s 	 	,	by	30	percent	 al 	 so 	 	.
so	,	the	problem	is	,	 your 	 s 	 	and	mine	,	all	of	our	 system 	 s 	 	are	changing	.
they	're	dynamic	.
i	mean	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 scar 	 y 	 	slide	,	not	to	take	an	 a 	 side 	 	,	but	it	 look 	 s 	 	at	 obes 	 ity 	 	in	the	world	.
and	i	'm	sorry	if	you	ca	n't	read	the	 number 	 s 	 	,	they	're	kind	of	small	.
but	,	if	you	start	to	look	at	it	,	that	red	,	that	dark	color	there	,	more	than	75	percent	of	the	population	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	are	 obes 	 e 	 	.
look	a	decade	ago	,	look	two	 decade 	 s 	 	ago	:	 mark 	 ed 	 ly 	 	different	.
so	,	our	 system 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	are	 dramat 	 ically 	 	different	than	our	 system 	 s 	 	a	decade	or	two	ago	.
so	the	 disease 	 s 	 	we	have	 to 	 day 	 	,	which	reflect	 pattern 	 s 	 	in	the	system	over	the	last	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 decade 	 s 	 	,	are	going	to	change	 dramat 	 ically 	 	over	the	next	decade	or	so	based	on	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	picture	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	it	is	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	is	a	40	-	gigabyte	picture	of	the	whole	 proteo 	 me 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	drop	of	blood	that	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	through	a	 super 	 conduct 	 ing 	 	magnet	,	and	we	're	able	to	get	 re 	 solution 	 	where	we	can	start	to	see	all	of	the	 protein 	 s 	 	in	the	body	.
we	can	start	to	see	that	system	.
each	of	the	red	 dot 	 s 	 	are	where	a	protein	 ha 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	identified	.
the	power	of	these	 magnet 	 s 	 	,	the	power	of	what	we	can	do	here	,	is	that	we	can	see	an	individual	neutron	with	 th 	 is 	 	technology	.
so	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	stuff	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	with	danny	hillis	and	a	group	 call 	 ed 	 	 appli 	 ed 	 	 proteo 	 mic 	 s 	 	,	where	we	can	start	to	see	individual	neutron	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	,
and	we	can	start	to	look	at	that	system	like	we	never	have	before	.
so	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	a	 r 	 eduction 	 ist 	 	view	,	we	're	taking	a	step	back	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	woman	,	46	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	who	had	 re 	 current 	 	lung	cancer	.
it	was	in	her	brain	,	in	her	 lung 	 s 	 	,	in	her	liver	.
she	had	gotten	carboplatin	taxol	,	carboplatin	taxotere	,	gemcitabine	,	navelbine	:
every	drug	we	have	she	had	gotten	,	and	that	disease	 continu 	 ed 	 	to	grow	.
she	had	three	 kid 	 s 	 	under	the	age	of	12	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	her	ct	 s 	 can 	 	.
and	so	what	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	is	we	're	taking	a	cross	-	section	of	her	body	here	,
and	you	can	see	in	the	middle	there	is	her	heart	,	and	to	the	side	of	her	heart	on	the	left	there	is	 th 	 is 	 	large	tumor	that	will	 invad 	 e 	 	and	will	kill	her	,	 un 	 treat 	 ed 	 	,	in	a	matter	of	 week 	 s 	 	.
she	 go 	 es 	 	on	a	pill	a	day	that	 target 	 s 	 	a	 path 	 way 	 	,	and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	if	 th 	 is 	 	 path 	 way 	 	was	in	the	system	,	in	the	cancer	,	but	it	 target 	 ed 	 	a	 path 	 way 	 	,	and	a	month	 lat 	 er 	 	,	pow	,	that	cancer	's	gone	.
six	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	it	's	still	gone	.
that	cancer	 recur 	 red 	 	,	and	she	 pass 	 ed 	 	away	three	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	from	lung	cancer	,	but	she	got	three	 year 	 s 	 	from	a	drug	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 symptom 	 s 	 	 pre 	 dominate 	 ly 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 ac 	 ne 	 	.
that	's	about	it	.
so	,	the	problem	is	that	the	 clinic 	 al 	 	trial	was	 d 	 one 	 	,	and	we	 we 	 re 	 	a	part	of	it	,	and	in	the	fundamental	 clinic 	 al 	 	trial	--	the	 pivot 	 al 	 	 clinic 	 al 	 	trial	we	call	the	phase	three	,	we	 re 	 fused 	 	to	use	a	 place 	 bo 	 	.
would	you	want	your	mother	,	your	brother	,	your	sister	to	get	a	 place 	 bo 	 	if	they	had	 advance 	 d 	 	lung	cancer	and	had	 week 	 s 	 	to	live	?
and	the	answer	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	is	not	.
so	,	it	was	 d 	 one 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	group	of	 patient 	 s 	 	.
ten	percent	of	people	in	the	trial	had	 th 	 is 	 	 dramat 	 ic 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	that	was	 show 	 n 	 	here	,	and	the	drug	went	to	the	fda	,	and	the	fda	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 with 	 out 	 	a	 place 	 bo 	 	,	how	do	i	know	 patient 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 benefit 	 ed 	 	from	the	drug	?	``
so	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	the	fda	was	going	to	meet	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	 editor 	 ial 	 	in	the	wall	street	journal	.
and	so	,	what	do	you	know	,	that	drug	was	approved	.
the	 amaz 	 ing 	 	thing	is	 an 	 other 	 	company	did	the	right	scientific	trial	,	where	they	 g 	 ave 	 	half	 place 	 bo 	 	and	half	the	drug	.
and	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	there	.
what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	they	did	it	in	south	america	and	canada	,	where	it	's	``	more	 ethic 	 al 	 	to	give	 place 	 bo 	 s 	 	.	``
they	had	to	give	it	 al 	 so 	 	in	the	u.s.	to	get	approval	,	so	i	think	there	 we 	 re 	 	three	u.s.	 patient 	 s 	 	in	 up 	 state 	 	new	york	who	 we 	 re 	 	part	of	the	trial	.
but	they	did	that	,	and	what	they	found	is	that	70	percent	of	the	non	-	 respond 	 ers 	 	lived	much	 long 	 er 	 	and	did	better	than	people	who	got	 place 	 bo 	 	.
so	it	 challeng 	 ed 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	we	 k 	 new 	 	in	cancer	,	is	that	you	do	n't	need	to	get	a	 respons 	 e 	 	.
you	do	n't	need	to	shrink	the	disease	.
if	we	 s 	 low 	 	the	disease	,	we	may	have	more	of	a	benefit	on	patient	 surviv 	 al 	 	,	patient	 out 	 come 	 	,	how	they	feel	,	than	if	we	shrink	the	disease	.
the	problem	is	that	,	if	i	'm	 th 	 is 	 	doc	,	and	i	get	your	ct	 s 	 can 	 	 to 	 day 	 	and	you	've	got	a	two	centimeter	mass	in	your	liver	,	and	you	come	back	to	me	in	three	 month 	 s 	 	and	it	's	three	 centimeter 	 s 	 	,	did	that	drug	help	you	or	not	?
how	do	i	know	?
would	it	have	 be 	 en 	 	10	 centimeter 	 s 	 	,	or	am	i	giving	you	a	drug	with	no	benefit	and	significant	cost	?
so	,	it	's	a	fundamental	problem	.
and	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	that	's	where	these	new	 techno 	 logies 	 	can	come	in	.
and	so	,	the	goal	 obvious 	 ly 	 	is	that	you	go	 in 	 to 	 	your	doctor	's	 off 	 ice 	 	--	well	,	the	ultimate	goal	is	that	you	prevent	disease	,	right	?
the	ultimate	goal	is	that	you	prevent	any	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	from	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
that	is	the	most	effective	,	cost	-	effective	,	best	way	we	can	do	 thing 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
but	if	one	is	 un 	 fortunate 	 	to	get	a	disease	,	you	'll	go	 in 	 to 	 	your	doctor	's	 off 	 ice 	 	,	he	or	she	will	take	a	drop	of	blood	,	and	we	will	start	to	know	how	to	treat	your	disease	.
the	way	we	've	 approach 	 ed 	 	it	is	the	field	of	 proteo 	 mic 	 s 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	looking	at	the	system	.
it	's	taking	a	big	picture	.
the	problem	with	 techno 	 logies 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	if	one	 look 	 s 	 	at	 protein 	 s 	 	in	the	body	,	there	are	11	 order 	 s 	 	of	 magn 	 itude 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	the	high	-	abundant	and	the	low	-	abundant	 protein 	 s 	 	.
so	,	there	's	no	technology	in	the	world	that	can	span	11	 order 	 s 	 	of	 magn 	 itude 	 	.
and	so	,	a	lot	of	what	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	with	people	like	danny	hillis	and	 other 	 s 	 	is	to	try	to	 br 	 ing 	 	in	 engineer 	 ing 	 	 principle 	 s 	 	,	try	to	 br 	 ing 	 	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	.
we	can	start	to	look	at	different	 component 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	 th 	 is 	 	spectrum	.
and	so	,	 ear 	 lier 	 	was	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	cross	-	discipline	,	about	 collabor 	 ation 	 	.
and	i	think	one	of	the	 excit 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	is	 start 	 ing 	 	to	happen	now	is	that	people	from	 t 	 hose 	 	 field 	 s 	 	are	coming	in	.
 yester 	 day 	 	,	the	national	cancer	institute	 announce 	 d 	 	a	new	program	 call 	 ed 	 	the	physical	 science 	 s 	 	and	 onco 	 logy 	 	,	where	 physicist 	 s 	 	,	 mathematic 	 ians 	 	,	are	 br 	 ought 	 	in	to	think	about	cancer	,	people	who	never	 approach 	 ed 	 	it	before	.
danny	and	i	got	16	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	they	 announce 	 d 	 	 yester 	 day 	 	,
to	try	to	attach	 th 	 is 	 	problem	.
a	whole	new	approach	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	giving	high	 dose 	 s 	 	of	 chemo 	 therapy 	 	by	different	 mechan 	 ism 	 s 	 	,	to	try	to	 br 	 ing 	 	technology	to	get	a	picture	of	what	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	the	body	.
so	,	just	for	two	 second 	 s 	 	,	how	these	 techno 	 logies 	 	work	--	 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	understand	it	.
what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	every	protein	in	your	body	is	charged	,	so	the	 protein 	 s 	 	are	 spray 	 ed 	 	in	,	the	magnet	 spin 	 s 	 	them	around	,	and	then	there	's	a	 detect 	 or 	 	at	the	end	.
when	it	hit	that	 detect 	 or 	 	is	dependent	on	the	mass	and	the	charge	.
and	so	we	can	 accurate 	 ly 	 	--	if	the	magnet	is	big	 en 	 ough 	 	,	and	your	 re 	 solution 	 	is	high	 en 	 ough 	 	--	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	detect	all	of	the	 protein 	 s 	 	in	the	body	and	start	to	get	an	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	the	individual	system	.
and	so	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	cancer	doctor	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	paper	in	my	chart	,	in	your	chart	,	and	it	 be 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	thick	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	data	flow	is	 start 	 ing 	 	to	look	like	in	our	 off 	 ice 	 s 	 	,	where	that	drop	of	blood	is	creating	 gigabyte 	 s 	 	of	data	.
 electron 	 ic 	 	data	 element 	 s 	 	are	 de 	 s 	 crib 	 ing 	 	every	 a 	 spect 	 	of	the	disease	.
and	 certain 	 ly 	 	the	goal	is	we	can	start	to	learn	from	every	 en 	 counter 	 	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	move	forward	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	just	 hav 	 ing 	 	 en 	 counter 	 	and	 en 	 counter 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	fundamental	 learn 	 ing 	 	.
so	,	to	conclude	,	we	need	to	get	away	from	 r 	 eduction 	 ist 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	.
we	need	to	start	to	think	 different 	 ly 	 	and	 radical 	 ly 	 	.
and	so	,	i	 imp 	 lore 	 	 every 	 one 	 	here	:	think	 different 	 ly 	 	.	come	up	with	new	 idea 	 s 	 	.
tell	them	to	me	or	 any 	 one 	 	else	in	our	field	,	 be 	 cause 	 	over	the	last	59	 year 	 s 	 	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	.
we	need	a	 radical 	 ly 	 	different	approach	.
you	know	,	andy	grove	 steppe 	 d 	 	down	 a 	 s 	 	 chair 	 man 	 	of	the	board	at	 in 	 tel 	 	--	and	andy	was	one	of	my	 mentor 	 s 	 	,	tough	individual	.	when	andy	 steppe 	 d 	 	down	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	technology	will	win	.	technology	 it 	 self 	 	will	win	.	``	and	i	'm	a	firm	 believ 	 er 	 	,	in	the	field	of	medicine	and	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	cancer	,	that	it	's	going	to	be	a	broad	platform	of	 techno 	 logies 	 	that	will	help	us	move	forward	and	 hope 	 fully 	 	help	 patient 	 s 	 	in	the	near	-	term	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
