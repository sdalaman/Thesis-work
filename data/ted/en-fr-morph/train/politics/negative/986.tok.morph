i	'm	a	visual	artist	,	and	i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	one	of	the	co	-	 founder 	 s 	 	of	the	plastic	 poll 	 ution 	 	 coal 	 ition 	 	.	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	with	plastic	 bag 	 s 	 	,	which	i	cut	up	and	sew	back	together	 a 	 s 	 	my	 prim 	 ary 	 	material	for	my	 art 	 work 	 	for	the	last	20	 year 	 s 	 	.
i	turn	them	 in 	 to 	 	two	and	three	-	dimensional	 piece 	 s 	 	and	 sculpt 	 ures 	 	and	 install 	 ations 	 	.
 up 	 on 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	with	the	plastic	,	after	about	the	first	eight	 year 	 s 	 	,	some	of	my	work	 start 	 ed 	 	to	 fi 	 s 	 s 	 ure 	 	and	break	down	 in 	 to 	 	 small 	 er 	 	little	bits	of	plastic	.
and	i	thought	,	``	great	.	it	's	ephemeral	just	like	us	.	``
 up 	 on 	 	 educ 	 ating 	 	 my 	 self 	 	a	little	further	about	 plastic 	 s 	 	,	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	 real 	 ized 	 	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	bad	thing	.
it	's	a	bad	thing	that	plastic	 break 	 s 	 	down	 in 	 to 	 	 small 	 er 	 	little	bits	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 al 	 ways 	 	still	plastic	.
and	what	we	're	 find 	 ing 	 	is	that	a	lot	of	it	is	in	the	marine	environment	.
i	then	,	in	the	last	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	 learn 	 ed 	 	about	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	garbage	patch	and	the	 gy 	 re 	 	.	and	my	 initi 	 al 	 	 re 	 action 	 	--	and	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	lot	of	people	's	first	 re 	 action 	 	to	 learn 	 ing 	 	about	it	--	is	,	``	oh	my	god	!
we	've	got	to	go	out	there	and	clean	 th 	 is 	 	thing	up	.	``
so	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	proposal	to	go	out	with	a	 car 	 go 	 	ship	and	two	 de 	 commission 	 ed 	 	 fish 	 ing 	 	 trawl 	 ers 	 	,	a	 cr 	 ane 	 	,	a	 chip 	 ping 	 	machine	and	a	cold	-	 mold 	 ing 	 	machine	.
and	my	 intent 	 ion 	 	was	to	go	out	to	the	 gy 	 re 	 	,	raise	 aware 	 ness 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	issue	and	begin	to	pick	up	the	plastic	,	chip	it	 in 	 to 	 	little	bits	and	cold	mold	it	 in 	 to 	 	 brick 	 s 	 	that	could	 potential 	 ly 	 	be	used	 a 	 s 	 	building	 material 	 s 	 	in	 under 	 develop 	 ed 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	.
i	 beg 	 an 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	with	people	who	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	out	to	the	 gy 	 re 	 	and	 we 	 re 	 	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	the	plastic	problem	in	the	marine	environment	and	 up 	 on 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	so	,	i	 real 	 ized 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	that	 clean 	 ing 	 	it	up	would	be	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	drop	in	the	 buck 	 et 	 	 relat 	 ive 	 	to	how	much	is	 be 	 ing 	 	generated	every	day	around	the	world	,	and	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	i	 need 	 ed 	 	to	back	up	and	look	at	the	 big 	 ger 	 	picture	.
and	the	 big 	 ger 	 	picture	is	:	we	need	to	find	a	way	to	turn	off	the	faucet	.
we	need	to	cut	the	spigot	of	single	-	use	and	 dispos 	 able 	 	 plastic 	 s 	 	,	which	are	 enter 	 ing 	 	the	marine	environment	every	day	on	a	global	scale	.
so	in	looking	at	that	,	i	 al 	 so 	 	 real 	 ized 	 	that	i	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 ang 	 ry 	 	.
i	was	n't	just	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	plastic	that	you	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	imagine	out	in	the	middle	of	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	ocean	--	of	which	i	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	there	are	now	11	 gy 	 re 	 s 	 	,	 potential 	 ly 	 	,	of	plastic	in	five	major	 ocean 	 s 	 	in	the	world	.
it	's	not	just	that	 gy 	 re 	 	of	plastic	that	i	'm	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	--	it	's	the	 gy 	 re 	 	of	plastic	in	the	 super 	 market 	 	.
i	'd	go	to	the	 super 	 market 	 	and	all	of	my	food	is	 package 	 d 	 	in	plastic	.
all	of	my	 beverage 	 s 	 	are	 package 	 d 	 	in	plastic	,	even	at	the	health	food	market	.
i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	the	plastic	in	the	 refrige 	 rator 	 	,	and	i	'm	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	the	plastic	and	the	 toxin 	 s 	 	that	 le 	 ach 	 	from	plastic	 in 	 to 	 	us	and	 in 	 to 	 	our	bodies	.
so	i	came	together	with	a	group	of	other	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	all	looking	at	 th 	 is 	 	issue	,	and	we	 create 	 d 	 	the	plastic	 poll 	 ution 	 	 coal 	 ition 	 	.
we	have	 man 	 y 	 	 initi 	 ative 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	on	,	but	some	of	them	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 bas 	 ic 	 	.
one	is	:	if	80	to	90	percent	of	what	we	're	 find 	 ing 	 	in	the	ocean	--	of	the	marine	 deb 	 ris 	 	that	we	're	 find 	 ing 	 	in	the	ocean	--	is	plastic	,	then	why	do	n't	we	call	it	what	it	is	.
it	's	plastic	 poll 	 ution 	 	.
 recycl 	 ing 	 	--	 every 	 body 	 	kind	of	 end 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 book 	 s 	 	about	 be 	 ing 	 	 sustain 	 able 	 	and	 green 	 ing 	 	with	the	idea	of	 recycl 	 ing 	 	.
you	put	 some 	 thing 	 	in	a	bin	and	you	do	n't	have	to	think	about	it	 aga 	 in 	 	.
what	is	the	 re 	 ality 	 	of	that	?
in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	less	than	seven	percent	of	our	 plastic 	 s 	 	are	 recycl 	 ed 	 	.
and	if	you	 re 	 ally 	 	look	 in 	 to 	 	it	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	plastic	 bottle 	 s 	 	,	most	of	it	is	 on 	 ly 	 	down	-	 cycle 	 d 	 	,	or	 inciner 	 ated 	 	,	or	 ship 	 ped 	 	to	 chin 	 a 	 	.
it	is	down	-	 cycle 	 d 	 	and	 turn 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 less 	 er 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	while	a	glass	bottle	can	be	a	glass	bottle	 aga 	 in 	 	or	can	be	used	 aga 	 in 	 	--	a	plastic	bottle	can	never	be	a	plastic	bottle	 aga 	 in 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	big	issue	for	us	.
 an 	 other 	 	thing	that	we	're	looking	at	and	 ask 	 ing 	 	people	to	think	about	is	we	've	 add 	 ed 	 	a	fourth	r	onto	the	front	of	the	``	 reduc 	 e 	 	,	 re 	 use 	 	,	 re 	 cycle 	 	,	``	three	r	's	,	and	that	is	 re 	 fuse 	 	.
 when 	 ever 	 	possible	,	 re 	 fuse 	 	single	-	use	and	 dispos 	 able 	 	 plastic 	 s 	 	.
 alter 	 native 	 s 	 	exist	;
some	of	them	are	 ver 	 y 	 	old	-	school	.
i	 my 	 self 	 	am	now	 collect 	 ing 	 	these	cool	pyrex	 contain 	 ers 	 	and	using	 t 	 hose 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	glad	and	tupperware	 contain 	 ers 	 	to	store	food	in	.
and	i	know	that	i	am	 do 	 ing 	 	a	service	to	 my 	 self 	 	and	my	family	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	to	pick	up	a	 stain 	 less 	 	-	steel	bottle	or	a	glass	bottle	,	if	you	're	 travel 	 ing 	 	and	you	've	 for 	 gotten 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	your	 stain 	 less 	 	-	steel	bottle	and	fill	that	up	with	water	or	 filter 	 ed 	 	water	,	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	 pur 	 chasing 	 	plastic	 bottle 	 d 	 	water	.
i	guess	what	i	want	to	say	to	 every 	 body 	 	here	--	and	i	know	that	you	 guy 	 s 	 	know	a	lot	about	 th 	 is 	 	issue	--	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	huge	problem	in	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	problem	that	we	've	 create 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 consumer 	 s 	 	and	we	can	solve	.
we	can	solve	 th 	 is 	 	by	raising	 aware 	 ness 	 	of	the	issue	and	 teach 	 ing 	 	people	to	 choos 	 e 	 	 alter 	 native 	 s 	 	.
so	 when 	 ever 	 	possible	,	to	 choos 	 e 	 	 alter 	 native 	 s 	 	to	single	-	use	 plastic 	 s 	 	.
we	can	cut	the	stem	--	tide	the	stem	of	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 to 	 	our	 ocean 	 s 	 	and	in	 do 	 ing 	 	so	,	 s 	 ave 	 	our	 ocean 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 ave 	 	our	planet	,	 s 	 ave 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
thank	you	.
