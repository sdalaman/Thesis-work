 every 	 one 	 	is	both	a	 learn 	 er 	 	and	a	teacher	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	me	 be 	 ing 	 	inspired	by	my	first	tutor	,	my	mom	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	me	 teach 	 ing 	 	 introduc 	 tion 	 	to	artificial	 intellig 	 ence 	 	to	200	 student 	 s 	 	at	stanford	university	.
now	the	 student 	 s 	 	and	i	 enjoy 	 ed 	 	the	class	,	but	it	 occur 	 red 	 	to	me	that	while	the	subject	matter	of	the	class	is	 advance 	 d 	 	and	modern	,	the	 teach 	 ing 	 	technology	is	n't	.
in	fact	,	i	use	 bas 	 ically 	 	the	same	technology	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	14th	-	century	 class 	 room 	 	.
note	the	 text 	 book 	 	,	the	 s 	 age 	 	on	the	stage	,	and	the	 sleep 	 ing 	 	guy	in	the	back	.
just	like	 to 	 day 	 	.
so	my	co	-	teacher	,	sebastian	thrun	,	and	i	thought	,	there	must	be	a	better	way	.
we	 challeng 	 ed 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	create	an	 on 	 line 	 	class	that	would	be	equal	or	better	in	quality	to	our	stanford	class	,	but	to	 br 	 ing 	 	it	to	 any 	 one 	 	in	the	world	for	free	.
we	 announce 	 d 	 	the	class	on	july	29th	,	and	 with 	 in 	 	two	 week 	 s 	 	,	50,000	people	had	 sign 	 ed 	 	up	for	it	.
and	that	grew	to	160,000	 student 	 s 	 	from	209	 count 	 ries 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 thrill 	 ed 	 	to	have	that	kind	of	audience	,	and	just	a	bit	 terr 	 ified 	 	that	we	had	n't	 finish 	 ed 	 	 pre 	 par 	 ing 	 	the	class	yet	.
so	we	got	to	work	.
we	 stud 	 ied 	 	what	 other 	 s 	 	had	 d 	 one 	 	,	what	we	could	copy	and	what	we	could	change	.
benjamin	bloom	had	 show 	 ed 	 	that	one	-	on	-	one	 tutor 	 ing 	 	 work 	 s 	 	best	,	so	that	's	what	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	 emul 	 ate 	 	,	like	with	me	and	my	mom	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	we	 k 	 new 	 	it	would	be	one	-	on	-	 thousand 	 s 	 	.
here	,	an	 over 	 head 	 	video	camera	is	 record 	 ing 	 	me	 a 	 s 	 	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	and	 draw 	 ing 	 	on	a	piece	of	paper	.
a	student	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	class	felt	like	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	a	bar	with	a	 re 	 ally 	 	smart	friend	who	's	 explain 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	you	have	n't	grasped	,	but	are	about	to	.	``	and	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	we	 we 	 re 	 	 aim 	 ing 	 	for	.
now	,	from	khan	academy	,	we	saw	that	short	10	-	minute	 video 	 s 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	much	better	than	 try 	 ing 	 	to	record	an	hour	-	long	 lectur 	 e 	 	and	put	it	on	the	small	-	format	screen	.
we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	go	even	 short 	 er 	 	and	more	 inter 	 active 	 	.
our	typical	video	is	two	 minute 	 s 	 	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 short 	 er 	 	,	never	more	than	six	,	and	then	we	pause	for	a	quiz	question	,	to	make	it	feel	like	one	-	on	-	one	 tutor 	 ing 	 	.
here	,	i	'm	 explain 	 ing 	 	how	a	computer	uses	the	 gram 	 mar 	 	of	english	to	parse	 sentence 	 s 	 	,	and	here	,	there	's	a	pause	and	the	student	 ha 	 s 	 	to	reflect	,	understand	what	's	going	on	and	check	the	right	boxes	before	they	can	 continu 	 e 	 	.
 student 	 s 	 	learn	best	when	they	're	 active 	 ly 	 	 p 	 rac 	 tic 	 ing 	 	.
we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	engage	them	,	to	have	them	 grappl 	 e 	 	with	 ambigu 	 ity 	 	and	guide	them	to	synthesize	the	key	 idea 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
we	 most 	 ly 	 	avoid	 question 	 s 	 	like	,	``	here	's	a	formula	,	now	tell	me	the	value	of	y	when	x	is	equal	to	two	.	``	we	 prefer 	 red 	 	open	-	 end 	 ed 	 	 question 	 s 	 	.
one	student	wrote	,	``	now	i	'm	 see 	 ing 	 	bayes	 network 	 s 	 	and	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	game	 theor 	 y 	 	 every 	 where 	 	i	look	.	``	and	i	like	that	kind	of	 respons 	 e 	 	.
that	's	just	what	we	 we 	 re 	 	going	for	.
we	did	n't	want	 student 	 s 	 	to	 memor 	 ize 	 	the	 formula 	 s 	 	;	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	change	the	way	they	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	world	.
and	we	 succeed 	 ed 	 	.
or	,	i	should	say	,	the	 student 	 s 	 	 succeed 	 ed 	 	.
and	it	's	a	little	bit	 iron 	 ic 	 	that	we	set	about	to	disrupt	 tradition 	 al 	 	education	,	and	in	 do 	 ing 	 	so	,	we	 end 	 ed 	 	up	making	our	 on 	 line 	 	class	much	more	like	a	 tradition 	 al 	 	college	class	than	other	 on 	 line 	 	 class 	 es 	 	.
most	 on 	 line 	 	 class 	 es 	 	,	the	 video 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 ways 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	.
you	can	watch	them	any	time	you	want	.
but	if	you	can	do	it	any	time	,	that	 mean 	 s 	 	you	can	do	it	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	,	and	if	you	can	do	it	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	,	well	,	you	may	not	ever	get	around	to	it	.
so	we	 br 	 ought 	 	back	the	 innov 	 ation 	 	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	due	 date 	 s 	 	.
you	could	watch	the	 video 	 s 	 	any	time	you	 want 	 ed 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	week	,	but	at	the	end	of	the	week	,	you	had	to	get	the	 home 	 work 	 	 d 	 one 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 motiv 	 ated 	 	the	 student 	 s 	 	to	keep	going	,	and	it	 al 	 so 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	that	 every 	 body 	 	was	 work 	 ing 	 	on	the	same	thing	at	the	same	time	,	so	if	you	went	 in 	 to 	 	a	 discuss 	 ion 	 	forum	,	you	could	get	an	answer	from	a	peer	 with 	 in 	 	 minute 	 s 	 	.
now	,	i	'll	show	you	some	of	the	 forum 	 s 	 	,	most	of	which	 we 	 re 	 	self	-	 organize 	 d 	 	by	the	 student 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
from	daphne	koller	and	andrew	ng	,	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	the	 con 	 cept 	 	of	``	 flip 	 ping 	 	``	the	 class 	 room 	 	.
 student 	 s 	 	 watch 	 ed 	 	the	 video 	 s 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	,	and	then	they	come	together	to	discuss	them	.
from	eric	mazur	,	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	about	peer	 instruct 	 ion 	 	,	that	 peer 	 s 	 	can	be	the	best	 teacher 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	remember	what	it	's	like	to	not	understand	.
sebastian	and	i	have	 for 	 gotten 	 	some	of	that	.
of	course	,	we	could	n't	have	a	 class 	 room 	 	 discuss 	 ion 	 	with	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 student 	 s 	 	,	so	we	 encourag 	 ed 	 	and	 nurture 	 d 	 	these	 on 	 line 	 	 forum 	 s 	 	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	from	teach	for	america	,	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	a	class	is	not	 prim 	 arily 	 	about	information	.
more	 import 	 ant 	 	is	 motiv 	 ation 	 	and	 determi 	 nation 	 	.
it	was	 cruci 	 al 	 	that	the	 student 	 s 	 	see	that	we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	hard	for	them	and	they	're	all	 support 	 ing 	 	each	other	.
now	,	the	class	ran	10	 week 	 s 	 	,	and	in	the	end	,	about	half	of	the	160,000	 student 	 s 	 	 watch 	 ed 	 	at	 l 	 east 	 	one	video	each	week	,	and	over	20,000	 finish 	 ed 	 	all	the	 home 	 work 	 	,	 put 	 ting 	 	in	50	to	100	 hour 	 s 	 	.
they	got	 th 	 is 	 	 state 	 ment 	 	of	 accomplish 	 ment 	 	.
so	what	have	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	?
well	,	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	some	old	 idea 	 s 	 	and	some	new	and	put	them	together	,	but	there	are	more	 idea 	 s 	 	to	try	.
sebastian	's	 teach 	 ing 	 	 an 	 other 	 	class	now	.
i	'll	do	one	in	the	fall	.
stanford	coursera	,	udacity	,	mitx	and	 other 	 s 	 	have	more	 class 	 es 	 	coming	.
it	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	time	.
but	to	me	,	the	most	 excit 	 ing 	 	part	of	it	is	the	data	that	we	're	 gather 	 ing 	 	.
we	're	 gather 	 ing 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 interact 	 ions 	 	per	student	per	class	,	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 interact 	 ions 	 	 al 	 together 	 	,	and	now	we	can	start	 analyz 	 ing 	 	that	,	and	when	we	learn	from	that	,	do	 experiment 	 ations 	 	,	that	's	when	the	real	revolution	will	come	.
and	you	'll	be	able	to	see	the	 result 	 s 	 	from	a	new	generation	of	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 student 	 s 	 	.
