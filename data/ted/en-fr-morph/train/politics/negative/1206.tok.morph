so	 to 	 day 	 	,	i	want	us	to	reflect	on	the	 de 	 mise 	 	of	 guy 	 s 	 	.
 guy 	 s 	 	are	flaming	out	 academic 	 ally 	 	;	they	're	 wi 	 ping 	 	out	 social 	 ly 	 	with	 girl 	 s 	 	and	 sexual 	 ly 	 	with	women	.
other	than	that	,	there	's	not	much	of	a	problem	.
so	what	's	the	data	?
so	the	data	on	dropping	out	is	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
 boy 	 s 	 	are	30	percent	more	 like 	 ly 	 	than	 girl 	 s 	 	to	drop	out	of	school	.
in	canada	,	five	 boy 	 s 	 	drop	out	for	every	three	 girl 	 s 	 	.
 girl 	 s 	 	 out 	 perform 	 	 boy 	 s 	 	now	at	every	level	,	from	 element 	 ary 	 	school	to	graduate	school	.
there	's	a	10	percent	 different 	 ial 	 	between	 get 	 ting 	 	ba	's	and	all	graduate	 program 	 s 	 	,	with	 guy 	 s 	 	 fall 	 ing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	 girl 	 s 	 	.
two	-	 third 	 s 	 	of	all	 student 	 s 	 	in	special	ed	.	 remedi 	 al 	 	 program 	 s 	 	are	 guy 	 s 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	all	know	,	 boy 	 s 	 	are	five	 time 	 s 	 	more	 like 	 ly 	 	than	 girl 	 s 	 	to	be	 label 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	attention	 defici 	 t 	 	 dis 	 order 	 	--	and	 there 	 fore 	 	we	drug	them	with	ritalin	.
what	's	the	evidence	of	 wi 	 ping 	 	out	?
first	,	it	's	a	new	fear	of	 in 	 timacy 	 	.
 in 	 timacy 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	physical	,	 emotion 	 al 	 	 connect 	 ion 	 	with	 some 	 body 	 	else	--	and	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	with	 some 	 body 	 	of	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	 s 	 ex 	 	who	 give 	 s 	 	off	 ambigu 	 ous 	 	,	 contradict 	 ory 	 	,	 phosphor 	 escent 	 	 signal 	 s 	 	.
and	every	year	there	's	research	 d 	 one 	 	on	self	-	 report 	 ed 	 	 s 	 hy 	 ness 	 	among	college	 student 	 s 	 	.
and	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	a	 stead 	 y 	 	 in 	 crease 	 	among	 male 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	two	 kind 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	social	 awkward 	 ness 	 	.
the	old	 s 	 hy 	 ness 	 	was	a	fear	of	 reject 	 ion 	 	.
it	's	a	social	 awkward 	 ness 	 	like	you	're	a	 strange 	 r 	 	in	a	foreign	land	.
they	do	n't	know	what	to	say	,	they	do	n't	know	what	to	do	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	one	-	on	-	one	[	with	the	]	 oppos 	 ite 	 	 s 	 ex 	 	.
they	do	n't	know	the	language	of	face	contact	,	the	non	-	verbal	and	verbal	set	of	 rule 	 s 	 	that	 en 	 able 	 	you	to	 comfort 	 ably 	 	talk	to	 some 	 body 	 	else	,	listen	to	 some 	 body 	 	else	.
there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	i	'm	 develop 	 ing 	 	here	 call 	 ed 	 	social	 intens 	 ity 	 	syndrome	,	which	tries	to	account	for	why	 guy 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	prefer	male	 bond 	 ing 	 	over	female	 mat 	 ing 	 	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	from	 ear 	 liest 	 	 child 	 hood 	 	,	 boy 	 s 	 	,	and	then	men	,	prefer	the	company	of	 guy 	 s 	 	--	physical	company	.
and	there	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 cort 	 ical 	 	arousal	we	're	looking	at	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	with	 guy 	 s 	 	in	 team 	 s 	 	,	in	 club 	 s 	 	,	in	 gang 	 s 	 	,	in	 fratern 	 ities 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	in	the	 militar 	 y 	 	,	and	then	in	 pub 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 peak 	 s 	 	at	super	bowl	sunday	when	 guy 	 s 	 	would	 ra 	 ther 	 	be	in	a	bar	with	 strange 	 rs 	 	,	 watch 	 ing 	 	a	 total 	 ly 	 	 over 	 dress 	 ed 	 	aaron	rodgers	of	the	green	 ba 	 y 	 	packers	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	jennifer	lopez	 total 	 ly 	 	naked	in	the	 bed 	 room 	 	.
the	problem	is	they	now	prefer	[	the	]	 a 	 synchron 	 istic 	 	 inter 	 net 	 	world	to	the	 spontane 	 ous 	 	 interact 	 ion 	 	in	social	 relationship 	 s 	 	.
what	are	the	 cause 	 s 	 	?	well	,	it	's	an	 un 	 intend 	 ed 	 	 con 	 sequence 	 	.
i	think	it	's	 excess 	 ive 	 	 inter 	 net 	 	use	in	general	,	 excess 	 ive 	 	video	 gam 	 ing 	 	,	 excess 	 ive 	 	new	access	to	 porn 	 ography 	 	.
the	problem	is	these	are	arousal	 addict 	 ions 	 	.
drug	 addict 	 ion 	 	,	you	 simpl 	 y 	 	want	more	.
arousal	 addict 	 ion 	 	,	you	want	different	.
 drug 	 s 	 	,	you	want	more	of	the	same	--	different	.
so	you	need	the	 novel 	 ty 	 	in	order	for	the	arousal	to	be	 sustain 	 ed 	 	.
and	the	problem	is	the	industry	is	 supply 	 ing 	 	it	.
jane	mcgonigal	told	us	last	year	that	by	the	time	a	boy	is	21	,	he	's	 play 	 ed 	 	10,000	 hour 	 s 	 	of	video	 game 	 s 	 	,	most	of	that	in	 isol 	 ation 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	remember	,	cindy	 gall 	 op 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	men	do	n't	know	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	making	love	and	 do 	 ing 	 	porn	.
the	average	boy	now	 watch 	 es 	 	50	porn	video	 clip 	 s 	 	a	week	.
and	there	's	some	guy	 watch 	 ing 	 	a	hundred	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	.
and	the	porn	industry	is	the	 fast 	 est 	 	growing	industry	in	america	--	15	billion	 annual 	 ly 	 	.
for	every	400	 movie 	 s 	 	made	in	hollywood	,	there	are	11,000	now	made	porn	 video 	 s 	 	.
so	the	effect	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	is	it	's	a	new	kind	of	arousal	.
 boy 	 s 	 	'	 brain 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 digital 	 ly 	 	 re 	 wired 	 	in	a	 total 	 ly 	 	new	way	for	change	,	 novel 	 ty 	 	,	 excit 	 ement 	 	and	constant	arousal	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	they	're	 total 	 ly 	 	out	of	sync	in	 tradition 	 al 	 	 class 	 es 	 	,	which	are	analog	,	static	,	 interact 	 ively 	 	 pass 	 ive 	 	.
they	're	 al 	 so 	 	 total 	 ly 	 	out	of	sync	in	romantic	 relationship 	 s 	 	,	which	build	 gradu 	 ally 	 	and	 sub 	 t 	 ly 	 	.
so	what	's	the	solution	?	it	's	not	my	job	.
i	'm	here	to	alarm	.	it	's	your	job	to	solve	.
but	who	should	care	?	the	 on 	 ly 	 	people	who	should	care	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	 parent 	 s 	 	of	 boy 	 s 	 	and	 girl 	 s 	 	,	 educ 	 ators 	 	,	 gam 	 ers 	 	,	 film 	 makers 	 	and	women	who	would	like	a	real	man	who	they	can	talk	to	,	who	can	dance	,	who	can	make	love	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	and	 con 	 tribute 	 	to	the	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 pressure 	 s 	 	to	keep	our	species	above	banana	 slug 	 s 	 	.
no	offense	to	banana	slug	 owner 	 s 	 	.	thank	you	.
