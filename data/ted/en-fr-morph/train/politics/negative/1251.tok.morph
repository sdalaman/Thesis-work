so	 to 	 day 	 	,	i	would	like	to	talk	with	you	about	 bio 	 nic 	 s 	 	,	which	is	the	popular	term	for	the	science	of	 re 	 placing 	 	part	of	a	living	organism	with	a	mechatronic	 de 	 vice 	 	,	or	a	robot	.
it	is	 essential 	 ly 	 	the	stuff	of	life	 meet 	 s 	 	machine	.
and	 specific 	 ally 	 	,	i	'd	like	to	talk	with	you	about	how	 bio 	 nic 	 s 	 	is	 evolv 	 ing 	 	for	people	with	arm	 amput 	 ations 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	our	 motiv 	 ation 	 	.
arm	 amput 	 ation 	 	 cause 	 s 	 	a	huge	 dis 	 ability 	 	.
i	mean	,	the	functional	 impair 	 ment 	 	is	clear	.
our	 hand 	 s 	 	are	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 instrument 	 s 	 	.
and	when	you	lose	one	,	far	less	both	,	it	's	a	lot	 hard 	 er 	 	to	do	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	 physical 	 ly 	 	need	to	do	.
there	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	huge	 emotion 	 al 	 	impact	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	 s 	 pend 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	of	my	time	in	clinic	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	the	 emotion 	 al 	 	 adjust 	 ment 	 	of	 patient 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	with	the	physical	 dis 	 ability 	 	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	there	's	a	 pro 	 found 	 	social	impact	.
we	talk	with	our	 hand 	 s 	 	.
we	greet	with	our	 hand 	 s 	 	.
and	we	interact	with	the	physical	world	with	our	 hand 	 s 	 	.
and	when	they	're	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	,	it	's	a	 bar 	 rier 	 	.
arm	 amput 	 ation 	 	is	 usual 	 ly 	 	 caus 	 ed 	 	by	trauma	,	with	 thing 	 s 	 	like	industrial	 accident 	 s 	 	,	motor	vehicle	 collision 	 s 	 	or	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 poignant 	 ly 	 	,	war	.
there	are	 al 	 so 	 	some	children	who	are	born	 with 	 out 	 	 arm 	 s 	 	,	 call 	 ed 	 	 con 	 genital 	 	limb	 defici 	 ency 	 	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	we	do	n't	do	great	with	upper	-	limb	 prost 	 hetic 	 s 	 	.
there	are	two	general	 type 	 s 	 	.
they	're	 call 	 ed 	 	body	-	powered	 pro 	 s 	 these 	 s 	 	,	which	 we 	 re 	 	 invent 	 ed 	 	just	after	the	civil	war	,	 refine 	 d 	 	in	world	war	i	and	world	war	ii	.
here	you	see	a	patent	for	an	arm	in	1912	.
it	's	not	a	lot	different	than	the	one	you	see	on	my	patient	.
they	work	by	 harness 	 ing 	 	shoulder	power	.
so	when	you	squish	your	 shoulder 	 s 	 	,	they	pull	on	a	 bi 	 cycle 	 	cable	.
and	that	 bi 	 cycle 	 	cable	can	open	or	close	a	hand	or	a	hook	or	bend	an	elbow	.
and	we	still	use	them	 common 	 ly 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 ro 	 bust 	 	and	 relat 	 ively 	 	simple	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	.
the	state	of	the	art	is	what	we	call	 myo 	 electric 	 	 pro 	 s 	 these 	 s 	 	.
these	are	 motor 	 ized 	 	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	that	are	controlled	by	little	 electric 	 al 	 	 signal 	 s 	 	from	your	muscle	.
every	time	you	contract	a	muscle	,	it	 emit 	 s 	 	a	little	 electric 	 ity 	 	that	you	can	record	with	 antenna 	 e 	 	or	 electro 	 de 	 s 	 	and	use	that	to	 oper 	 ate 	 	the	 motor 	 ized 	 	 pro 	 s 	 thesis 	 	.
they	work	 pre 	 tty 	 	well	for	people	who	have	just	lost	 the 	 ir 	 	hand	,	 be 	 cause 	 	your	hand	 muscle 	 s 	 	are	still	there	.
you	 squeez 	 e 	 	your	hand	,	these	 muscle 	 s 	 	contract	.
you	open	it	,	these	 muscle 	 s 	 	contract	.
so	it	's	intuitive	,	and	it	 work 	 s 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	well	.
well	how	about	with	 high 	 er 	 	 level 	 s 	 	of	 amput 	 ation 	 	?
now	you	've	lost	your	arm	above	the	elbow	.
you	're	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	not	 on 	 ly 	 	these	 muscle 	 s 	 	,	but	your	hand	and	your	elbow	too	.
what	do	you	do	?
well	our	 patient 	 s 	 	have	to	use	 ver 	 y 	 	code	-	y	 system 	 s 	 	of	using	just	 the 	 ir 	 	arm	 muscle 	 s 	 	to	 oper 	 ate 	 	robotic	 limb 	 s 	 	.
we	have	robotic	 limb 	 s 	 	.
there	are	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	on	the	market	,	and	here	you	see	a	few	.
they	contain	just	a	hand	that	will	open	and	close	,	a	wrist	 rot 	 ator 	 	and	an	elbow	.
there	's	no	other	 function 	 s 	 	.
if	they	did	,	how	would	we	tell	them	what	to	do	?
we	built	our	own	arm	at	the	rehab	institute	of	chicago	where	we	've	 add 	 ed 	 	some	wrist	 flex 	 ion 	 	and	shoulder	 joint 	 s 	 	to	get	up	to	six	 motor 	 s 	 	,	or	six	 degree 	 s 	 	of	 free 	 dom 	 	.
and	we	've	had	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	work	with	some	 ver 	 y 	 	 advance 	 d 	 	 arm 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	funded	by	the	u.s.	 militar 	 y 	 	,	using	these	 prototype 	 s 	 	,	that	had	up	to	10	different	 degree 	 s 	 	of	 free 	 dom 	 	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	movable	 hand 	 s 	 	.
but	at	the	end	of	the	day	,	how	do	we	tell	these	robotic	 arm 	 s 	 	what	to	do	?
how	do	we	control	them	?
well	we	need	a	neural	 inter 	 face 	 	,	a	way	to	connect	to	our	nervous	system	or	our	thought	 process 	 es 	 	so	that	it	's	intuitive	,	it	's	natural	,	like	for	you	and	i	.
well	the	body	 work 	 s 	 	by	 start 	 ing 	 	a	motor	command	in	your	brain	,	going	down	your	 spin 	 al 	 	cord	,	out	the	 nerve 	 s 	 	and	to	your	 per 	 iph 	 ery 	 	.
and	your	 sens 	 ation 	 	's	the	exact	 oppos 	 ite 	 	.
you	touch	 your 	 self 	 	,	there	's	a	 stimul 	 us 	 	that	 come 	 s 	 	up	 t 	 hose 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	same	 nerve 	 s 	 	back	up	to	your	brain	.
when	you	lose	your	arm	,	that	nervous	system	still	 work 	 s 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	 nerve 	 s 	 	can	put	out	command	 signal 	 s 	 	.
and	if	i	tap	the	nerve	 end 	 ing 	 	on	a	world	war	ii	vet	,	he	'll	still	feel	his	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	hand	.
so	you	might	say	,	let	's	go	to	the	brain	and	put	 some 	 thing 	 	in	the	brain	to	record	 signal 	 s 	 	,	or	in	the	end	of	the	 per 	 iph 	 er 	 al 	 	nerve	and	record	them	there	.
and	these	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	research	 area 	 s 	 	,	but	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	.
you	have	to	put	in	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 micro 	 scopic 	 	 wire 	 s 	 	to	record	from	little	 tin 	 y 	 	individual	 neuro 	 ns 	 	--	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 fiber 	 s 	 	that	put	out	 tin 	 y 	 	 signal 	 s 	 	that	are	 micro 	 volt 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	just	too	hard	to	use	now	and	for	my	 patient 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
so	we	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	different	approach	.
we	're	using	a	 bio 	 logical 	 	 ampl 	 ifier 	 	to	 ampl 	 ify 	 	these	nerve	 signal 	 s 	 	--	 muscle 	 s 	 	.
 muscle 	 s 	 	will	 ampl 	 ify 	 	the	nerve	 signal 	 s 	 	about	a	thousand	-	fold	,	so	that	we	can	record	them	from	on	top	of	the	skin	,	like	you	saw	 ear 	 lier 	 	.
so	our	approach	is	 some 	 thing 	 	we	call	 target 	 ed 	 	 reinnerv 	 ation 	 	.
imagine	,	with	 some 	 body 	 	who	's	lost	 the 	 ir 	 	whole	arm	,	we	still	have	four	major	 nerve 	 s 	 	that	go	down	your	arm	.
and	we	take	the	nerve	away	from	your	chest	muscle	and	let	these	 nerve 	 s 	 	grow	 in 	 to 	 	it	.
now	you	think	,	``	close	hand	,	``	and	a	little	section	of	your	chest	 contract 	 s 	 	.
you	think	,	``	bend	elbow	,	``	a	different	section	 contract 	 s 	 	.
and	we	can	use	 electro 	 de 	 s 	 	or	 antenna 	 e 	 	to	pick	that	up	and	tell	the	arm	to	move	.
that	's	the	idea	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	man	that	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	it	on	.
his	name	is	jesse	sullivan	.
he	's	just	a	saint	of	a	man	--	54	-	year	-	old	 line 	 man 	 	who	 touch 	 ed 	 	the	wrong	wire	and	had	both	of	his	 arm 	 s 	 	 burn 	 t 	 	so	 bad 	 ly 	 	they	had	to	be	 amput 	 ated 	 	at	the	shoulder	.
jesse	came	to	us	at	the	ric	to	be	fit	with	these	state	-	of	-	the	-	art	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	,	and	here	you	see	them	.
i	'm	still	using	that	old	technology	with	a	 bi 	 cycle 	 	cable	on	his	right	side	.
and	he	 pick 	 s 	 	which	joint	he	 want 	 s 	 	to	move	with	 t 	 hose 	 	chin	 s 	 witch 	 es 	 	.
on	the	left	side	he	's	got	a	modern	 motor 	 ized 	 	 pro 	 s 	 thesis 	 	with	 t 	 hose 	 	three	 joint 	 s 	 	,	and	he	 oper 	 ates 	 	little	 pad 	 s 	 	in	his	shoulder	that	he	 touch 	 es 	 	to	make	the	arm	go	.
and	jesse	's	a	good	 cr 	 ane 	 	 oper 	 ator 	 	,	and	he	did	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	by	our	 standard 	 s 	 	.
he	 al 	 so 	 	 requir 	 ed 	 	a	 re 	 vision 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	on	his	chest	.
and	that	 g 	 ave 	 	us	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	do	 target 	 ed 	 	 reinnerv 	 ation 	 	.
so	my	 col 	 league 	 	,	dr.	greg	dumanian	,	did	the	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	.	first	,	we	cut	away	the	nerve	to	his	own	muscle	,	then	we	took	the	arm	 nerve 	 s 	 	and	just	kind	of	had	them	shift	down	onto	his	chest	and	closed	him	up	.
and	after	about	three	 month 	 s 	 	,	the	 nerve 	 s 	 	grew	in	a	little	bit	and	we	could	get	a	twitch	.
and	after	six	 month 	 s 	 	,	the	 nerve 	 s 	 	grew	in	well	,	and	you	could	see	strong	 contract 	 ions 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	jesse	 think 	 s 	 	open	and	close	his	hand	,	or	bend	or	 straight 	 en 	 	your	elbow	.
you	can	see	the	 move 	 ments 	 	on	his	chest	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	little	hash	 mark 	 s 	 	are	where	we	put	our	 antenna 	 e 	 	,	or	 electro 	 de 	 s 	 	.
and	i	 challeng 	 e 	 	 any 	 body 	 	in	the	room	to	make	 the 	 ir 	 	chest	go	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
his	brain	is	 think 	 ing 	 	about	his	arm	.
he	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 learn 	 ed 	 	how	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	with	the	chest	.
there	is	not	a	 learn 	 ing 	 	process	.
that	's	why	it	's	intuitive	.
so	here	's	jesse	in	our	first	little	test	with	him	.
on	the	left	-	hand	side	,	you	see	his	original	 pro 	 s 	 thesis 	 	,	and	he	's	using	 t 	 hose 	 	 s 	 witch 	 es 	 	to	move	little	 block 	 s 	 	from	one	box	to	the	other	.
he	's	had	that	arm	for	about	20	 month 	 s 	 	,	so	he	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	with	it	.
on	the	right	side	,	two	 month 	 s 	 	after	we	fit	him	with	his	 target 	 ed 	 	 reinnerv 	 ation 	 	 pro 	 s 	 thesis 	 	--	which	,	by	the	way	,	is	the	same	physical	arm	,	just	 programm 	 ed 	 	a	little	different	--	you	can	see	that	he	's	much	 fast 	 er 	 	and	much	 smooth 	 er 	 	 a 	 s 	 	he	 move 	 s 	 	these	little	 block 	 s 	 	.
and	we	're	 on 	 ly 	 	able	to	use	three	of	the	 signal 	 s 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	time	.
then	we	had	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	little	 surprise 	 s 	 	in	science	.
so	we	're	all	 motiv 	 ated 	 	to	get	motor	 command 	 s 	 	to	drive	robotic	 arm 	 s 	 	.
and	after	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	,	you	touch	jesse	on	his	chest	,	and	he	felt	his	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	hand	.
his	hand	 sens 	 ation 	 	grew	 in 	 to 	 	his	chest	 aga 	 in 	 	 prob 	 ably 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	had	 al 	 so 	 	taken	away	a	lot	of	fat	,	so	the	skin	was	right	down	to	the	muscle	and	 deinnervate 	 d 	 	,	if	you	would	,	his	skin	.
so	you	touch	jesse	here	,	he	 feel 	 s 	 	his	thumb	;	you	touch	it	here	,	he	 feel 	 s 	 	his	 pink 	 y 	 	.
he	 feel 	 s 	 	light	touch	down	to	one	gram	of	force	.
he	 feel 	 s 	 	hot	,	cold	,	sharp	,	dull	,	all	in	his	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	hand	,	or	both	his	hand	and	his	chest	,	but	he	can	attend	to	either	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	for	us	,	 be 	 cause 	 	now	we	have	a	 port 	 al 	 	,	a	 port 	 al 	 	,	or	a	way	to	 potential 	 ly 	 	give	back	 sens 	 ation 	 	,	so	that	he	might	feel	what	he	 touch 	 es 	 	with	his	 prost 	 hetic 	 	hand	.
imagine	 sensor 	 s 	 	in	the	hand	coming	up	and	 press 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	new	hand	skin	.
so	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	.
we	've	 al 	 so 	 	gone	on	with	what	was	 initi 	 ally 	 	our	 prim 	 ary 	 	population	of	people	with	above	-	the	-	elbow	 amput 	 ations 	 	.
and	here	we	deinnervate	,	or	cut	the	nerve	away	,	just	from	little	 segment 	 s 	 	of	muscle	and	 leav 	 e 	 	 other 	 s 	 	 al 	 one 	 	that	give	us	our	up	-	down	 signal 	 s 	 	and	two	 other 	 s 	 	that	will	give	us	a	hand	open	and	close	signal	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	one	of	our	first	 patient 	 s 	 	,	chris	.
you	see	him	with	his	original	 de 	 vice 	 	on	the	left	there	after	eight	 month 	 s 	 	of	use	,	and	on	the	right	,	it	is	two	 month 	 s 	 	.
he	's	about	four	or	five	 time 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	fast	with	 th 	 is 	 	simple	little	performance	metric	.
all	right	.
so	one	of	the	best	 part 	 s 	 	of	my	job	is	 work 	 ing 	 	with	 re 	 ally 	 	great	 patient 	 s 	 	who	are	 al 	 so 	 	our	research	 collabor 	 ators 	 	.
and	we	're	fortunate	 to 	 day 	 	to	have	amanda	kitts	come	and	join	us	.
 pleas 	 e 	 	welcome	amanda	kitts	.
so	amanda	,	would	you	 pleas 	 e 	 	tell	us	how	you	lost	your	arm	?
amanda	kitts	:	 s 	 ure 	 	.	in	2006	,	i	had	a	car	accident	.
and	i	was	 driv 	 ing 	 	home	from	work	,	and	a	truck	was	coming	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	direction	,	came	over	 in 	 to 	 	my	lane	,	ran	over	the	top	of	my	car	and	his	axle	 to 	 re 	 	my	arm	off	.
todd	kuiken	:	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	after	your	 amput 	 ation 	 	,	you	 heal 	 ed 	 	up	.
and	you	've	got	one	of	these	 convention 	 al 	 	 arm 	 s 	 	.
can	you	tell	us	how	it	 work 	 ed 	 	?
ak	:	well	,	it	was	a	little	difficult	,	 be 	 cause 	 	all	i	had	to	work	with	was	a	bicep	and	a	 tric 	 ep 	 	.
so	for	the	simple	little	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 pick 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	up	,	i	would	have	to	bend	my	elbow	,	and	then	i	would	have	to	 co 	 contract 	 	to	get	it	to	change	 mode 	 s 	 	.
when	i	did	that	,	i	had	to	use	my	bicep	to	get	the	hand	to	close	,	use	my	 tric 	 ep 	 	to	get	it	to	open	,	 co 	 contract 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	to	get	the	elbow	to	work	 aga 	 in 	 	.	tk	:	so	it	was	a	little	 s 	 low 	 	?
ak	:	a	little	 s 	 low 	 	,	and	it	was	just	hard	to	work	.	you	had	to	 concent 	 rate 	 	a	whole	lot	.
tk	:	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	i	think	about	nine	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	that	you	had	the	 target 	 ed 	 	 reinnerv 	 ation 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	,	took	six	more	 month 	 s 	 	to	have	all	the	 reinnerv 	 ation 	 	.
then	we	fit	her	with	a	 pro 	 s 	 thesis 	 	.
and	how	did	that	work	for	you	?
ak	:	it	 work 	 s 	 	good	.
i	was	able	to	use	my	elbow	and	my	hand	 simultaneous 	 ly 	 	.
i	could	work	them	just	by	my	 thought 	 s 	 	.
so	i	did	n't	have	to	do	any	of	the	 co 	 contract 	 ing 	 	and	all	that	.
tk	:	a	little	 fast 	 er 	 	?
ak	:	a	little	 fast 	 er 	 	.	and	much	more	easy	,	much	more	natural	.
tk	:	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	my	goal	.
for	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	my	goal	was	to	let	 some 	 body 	 	[	be	]	able	to	use	 the 	 ir 	 	elbow	and	hand	in	an	intuitive	way	and	at	the	same	time	.
and	we	now	have	over	50	 patient 	 s 	 	around	the	world	who	have	had	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	over	a	dozen	of	our	 wound 	 ed 	 	 warrior 	 s 	 	in	the	u.s.	 arm 	 ed 	 	 service 	 s 	 	.
the	success	rate	of	the	nerve	 transfer 	 s 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	high	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	 put 	 ting 	 	a	big	fat	nerve	onto	a	little	piece	of	muscle	.
and	it	 provide 	 s 	 	intuitive	control	.
our	functional	 test 	 ing 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	little	 test 	 s 	 	,	all	show	that	they	're	a	lot	 quick 	 er 	 	and	a	lot	 eas 	 ier 	 	.
and	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	is	our	 patient 	 s 	 	have	 appreciate 	 d 	 	it	.
so	that	was	all	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	.
but	we	want	to	do	better	.
there	's	a	lot	of	information	in	 t 	 hose 	 	nerve	 signal 	 s 	 	,	and	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	get	more	.
you	can	move	each	finger	.	you	can	move	your	thumb	,	your	wrist	.
can	we	get	more	out	of	it	?
so	we	did	some	 experiment 	 s 	 	where	we	 saturate 	 d 	 	our	poor	 patient 	 s 	 	with	 zillion 	 s 	 	of	 electro 	 de 	 s 	 	and	then	had	them	try	to	do	two	dozen	different	 task 	 s 	 	--	from	 wig 	 gling 	 	a	finger	to	moving	a	whole	arm	to	 reach 	 ing 	 	for	 some 	 thing 	 	--	and	 record 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	data	.
and	then	we	used	some	 algorithm 	 s 	 	that	are	a	lot	like	speech	 re 	 cognition 	 	 algorithm 	 s 	 	,
 call 	 ed 	 	pattern	 re 	 cognition 	 	.
see	.
and	here	you	can	see	,	on	jesse	's	chest	,	when	he	just	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	do	three	different	 thing 	 s 	 	,	you	can	see	three	different	 pattern 	 s 	 	.
but	i	ca	n't	put	in	an	 electro 	 de 	 	and	say	,	``	go	there	.	``
so	we	 collabor 	 ated 	 	with	our	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	in	university	of	new	brunswick	,	came	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	algorithm	control	,	which	amanda	can	now	 demonst 	 rate 	 	.
ak	:	so	i	have	the	elbow	that	 go 	 es 	 	up	and	down	.
i	have	the	wrist	 rot 	 ation 	 	that	 go 	 es 	 	--	and	it	can	go	all	the	way	around	.
and	i	have	the	wrist	 flex 	 ion 	 	and	 extens 	 ion 	 	.
and	i	 al 	 so 	 	have	the	hand	closed	and	open	.
tk	:	thank	you	,	amanda	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	research	arm	,	but	it	's	made	out	of	commercial	 component 	 s 	 	from	here	down	and	a	few	that	i	've	 borrow 	 ed 	 	from	around	the	world	.
it	's	about	seven	 pound 	 s 	 	,	which	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	about	what	my	arm	would	weigh	if	i	lost	it	right	here	.
 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	that	's	heavy	for	amanda	.
and	in	fact	,	it	 feel 	 s 	 	even	 heav 	 ier 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	not	 glu 	 ed 	 	on	the	same	.
she	's	 carry 	 ing 	 	all	the	weight	through	 harness 	 es 	 	.
so	the	 excit 	 ing 	 	part	is	n't	so	much	the	 mechatronic 	 s 	 	,	but	the	control	.
so	we	've	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	small	 micro 	 computer 	 	that	is	 blink 	 ing 	 	 some 	 where 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	her	back	and	is	 oper 	 ating 	 	 th 	 is 	 	all	by	the	way	she	 train 	 s 	 	it	to	use	her	individual	muscle	 signal 	 s 	 	.
so	amanda	,	when	you	first	 start 	 ed 	 	using	 th 	 is 	 	arm	,	how	long	did	it	take	to	use	it	?
ak	:	it	took	just	about	 prob 	 ably 	 	three	to	four	 hour 	 s 	 	to	get	it	to	train	.
i	had	to	hook	it	up	to	a	computer	,	so	i	could	n't	just	train	it	 any 	 where 	 	.
so	if	it	 stop 	 ped 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	,	i	just	had	to	take	it	off	.
so	now	it	's	able	to	train	with	just	 th 	 is 	 	little	piece	on	the	back	.
i	can	wear	it	around	.
if	it	 stop 	 s 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	for	some	reason	,	i	can	 re 	 train 	 	it	.
 take 	 s 	 	about	a	minute	.
tk	:	so	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	now	we	're	 get 	 ting 	 	to	a	 clinic 	 ally 	 	practical	 de 	 vice 	 	.	and	that	's	where	our	goal	is	--	to	have	 some 	 thing 	 	 clinic 	 ally 	 	 pragmat 	 ic 	 	to	wear	.
we	've	 al 	 so 	 	had	amanda	able	to	use	some	of	our	more	 advance 	 d 	 	 arm 	 s 	 	that	i	 show 	 ed 	 	you	 ear 	 lier 	 	.
here	's	amanda	using	an	arm	made	by	deka	research	corporation	.
and	i	 believ 	 e 	 	dean	kamen	 present 	 ed 	 	it	at	ted	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
so	amanda	,	you	can	see	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	good	control	.
it	's	all	the	pattern	 re 	 cognition 	 	.
and	it	now	 ha 	 s 	 	a	hand	that	can	do	different	 grasp 	 s 	 	.
what	we	do	is	have	the	patient	go	all	the	way	open	and	think	,	``	what	hand	grasp	pattern	do	i	want	?	``
it	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	that	mode	,	and	then	you	can	do	up	to	five	or	six	different	hand	 grasp 	 s 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	hand	.
amanda	,	how	 man 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	you	able	to	do	with	the	deka	arm	?
ak	:	i	was	able	to	get	four	.
i	had	the	key	grip	,	i	had	a	chuck	grip	,	i	had	a	power	grasp	and	i	had	a	fine	pinch	.
but	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	one	was	just	when	the	hand	was	open	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	work	with	 kid 	 s 	 	,	and	so	all	the	time	you	're	 clap 	 ping 	 	and	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	,	so	i	was	able	to	do	that	 aga 	 in 	 	,	which	was	 re 	 ally 	 	good	.
tk	:	that	hand	's	not	so	good	for	 clap 	 ping 	 	.
ak	:	ca	n't	clap	with	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
tk	:	all	right	.	so	that	's	 excit 	 ing 	 	on	where	we	may	go	with	the	better	 mechatronic 	 s 	 	,	if	we	make	them	good	 en 	 ough 	 	to	put	out	on	the	market	and	use	in	a	field	trial	.
i	want	you	to	watch	 close 	 ly 	 	.
claudia	:	oooooh	!
tk	:	that	's	claudia	,	and	that	was	the	first	time	she	got	to	feel	 sens 	 ation 	 	through	her	 prost 	 hetic 	 	.
she	had	a	little	sensor	at	the	end	of	her	 pro 	 s 	 thesis 	 	that	then	she	 rub 	 bed 	 	over	different	 surface 	 s 	 	,	and	she	could	feel	different	 text 	 ures 	 	of	 sand 	 paper 	 	,	different	 grit 	 s 	 	,	ribbon	cable	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 push 	 ed 	 	on	her	 reinnerv 	 ated 	 	hand	skin	.
she	 s 	 aid 	 	that	when	she	just	ran	it	 a 	 cross 	 	the	table	,	it	felt	like	her	finger	was	 rock 	 ing 	 	.
so	that	's	an	 excit 	 ing 	 	 labor 	 atory 	 	experiment	on	how	to	give	back	,	 potential 	 ly 	 	,	some	skin	 sens 	 ation 	 	.
but	here	's	 an 	 other 	 	video	that	 show 	 s 	 	some	of	our	 challeng 	 es 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	jesse	,	and	he	's	 squeez 	 ing 	 	a	foam	 to 	 y 	 	.
and	the	 hard 	 er 	 	he	 squeez 	 es 	 	--	you	see	a	little	black	thing	in	the	middle	that	's	 push 	 ing 	 	on	his	skin	 proportion 	 al 	 	to	how	hard	he	 squeez 	 es 	 	.
but	look	at	all	the	 electro 	 de 	 s 	 	around	it	.
i	've	got	a	real	 e 	 state 	 	problem	.
you	're	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	put	a	bunch	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	on	there	,	but	our	little	motor	's	making	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	noise	right	next	to	my	 electro 	 de 	 s 	 	.
so	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 challeng 	 ed 	 	on	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	there	.
the	future	is	bright	.
we	're	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	where	we	are	and	a	lot	of	 thing 	 s 	 	we	want	to	do	.
so	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	one	is	to	get	rid	of	my	real	 e 	 state 	 	problem	and	get	better	 signal 	 s 	 	.
we	want	to	develop	these	little	 tin 	 y 	 	 cap 	 sule 	 s 	 	about	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	piece	of	risotto	that	we	can	put	 in 	 to 	 	the	 muscle 	 s 	 	and	 tele 	 meter 	 	out	the	emg	 signal 	 s 	 	,	so	that	it	's	not	 worry 	 ing 	 	about	 electro 	 de 	 	contact	.
and	we	can	have	the	real	 e 	 state 	 	open	to	try	more	 sens 	 ation 	 	 feed 	 back 	 	.
we	want	to	build	a	better	arm	.
 th 	 is 	 	arm	--	they	're	 al 	 ways 	 	made	for	the	50th	 percent 	 ile 	 	male	--	which	 mean 	 s 	 	they	're	too	big	for	five	-	eighths	of	the	world	.
so	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	a	super	strong	or	super	fast	arm	,	we	're	making	an	arm	that	is	--	we	're	 start 	 ing 	 	with	,	the	25th	 percent 	 ile 	 	female	--	that	will	have	a	hand	that	 wrap 	 s 	 	around	,	 open 	 s 	 	all	the	way	,	two	 degree 	 s 	 	of	 free 	 dom 	 	in	the	wrist	and	an	elbow	.
so	it	'll	be	the	 small 	 est 	 	and	 light 	 est 	 	and	the	 smart 	 est 	 	arm	ever	made	.
once	we	can	do	it	that	small	,	it	's	a	lot	 eas 	 ier 	 	making	them	 big 	 ger 	 	.
so	 t 	 hose 	 	are	just	some	of	our	 goal 	 s 	 	.
and	we	 re 	 ally 	 	appreciate	you	all	 be 	 ing 	 	here	 to 	 day 	 	.
i	'd	like	to	tell	you	a	little	bit	about	the	dark	side	,	with	 yester 	 day 	 	's	theme	.
so	amanda	came	jet	-	lagged	,	she	's	using	the	arm	,	there	was	a	computer	spook	,	a	broken	wire	,	a	 convert 	 er 	 	that	 spark 	 ed 	 	.
we	took	out	a	whole	circuit	in	the	hotel	and	just	about	put	on	the	fire	alarm	.
and	 non 	 e 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	could	i	have	 deal 	 t 	 	with	,	but	i	have	a	 re 	 ally 	 	bright	research	team	.
and	 thank 	 fully 	 	dr.	annie	simon	was	with	us	and	 work 	 ed 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	 yester 	 day 	 	to	fix	it	.
that	's	science	.
and	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	it	 work 	 ed 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
so	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
