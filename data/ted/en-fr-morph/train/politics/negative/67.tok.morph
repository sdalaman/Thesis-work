 a 	 s 	 	other	 speaker 	 s 	 	have	 s 	 aid 	 	,	it	's	a	 ra 	 ther 	 	 daunt 	 ing 	 	experience	--	a	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 daunt 	 ing 	 	experience	--	to	be	 s 	 peaking 	 	in	front	of	 th 	 is 	 	audience	.
but	 un 	 like 	 	the	other	 speaker 	 s 	 	,	i	'm	not	going	to	tell	you	about	the	 myster 	 ies 	 	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	or	the	 wonder 	 s 	 	of	evolution	,	or	the	 re 	 ally 	 	clever	,	 innov 	 ative 	 	ways	people	are	 attack 	 ing 	 	the	major	 in 	 equal 	 ities 	 	in	our	world	.
or	even	the	 challeng 	 es 	 	of	nation	-	 state 	 s 	 	in	the	modern	global	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
my	brief	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	've	just	heard	,	is	to	tell	you	about	 statistic 	 s 	 	--	and	,	to	be	more	precise	,	to	tell	you	some	 excit 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	about	 statistic 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	--	--	that	's	 ra 	 ther 	 	more	 challeng 	 ing 	 	than	all	the	 speaker 	 s 	 	before	me	and	all	the	 one 	 s 	 	coming	after	me	.
one	of	my	senior	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	told	me	,	when	i	was	a	 young 	 ster 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	profession	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	 proud 	 ly 	 	,	that	 statistic 	 ians 	 	 we 	 re 	 	people	who	 like 	 d 	 	 figure 	 s 	 	but	did	n't	have	the	 personal 	 ity 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	 account 	 ants 	 	.
and	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	in	-	joke	among	 statistic 	 ians 	 	,	and	that	's	,	``	how	do	you	tell	the	 introvert 	 ed 	 	 statistic 	 ian 	 	from	the	 extrovert 	 ed 	 	 statistic 	 ian 	 	?	``
to	which	the	answer	is	,	``	the	 extrovert 	 ed 	 	 statistic 	 ian 	 	's	the	one	who	 look 	 s 	 	at	the	other	person	's	 shoe 	 s 	 	.	``
but	i	want	to	tell	you	 some 	 thing 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	--	and	here	it	is	,	so	 concent 	 rate 	 	now	.
 th 	 is 	 	 even 	 ing 	 	,	there	's	a	 re 	 ception 	 	in	the	university	's	museum	of	natural	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
and	it	's	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	setting	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	hope	you	'll	find	,	and	a	great	icon	to	the	best	of	the	victorian	tradition	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 like 	 ly 	 	--	in	 th 	 is 	 	special	setting	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 collect 	 ion 	 	of	people	--	but	you	might	just	find	 your 	 self 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	 some 	 one 	 	you	'd	 ra 	 ther 	 	wish	that	you	 we 	 re 	 	n't	.
so	here	's	what	you	do	.
when	they	say	to	you	,	``	what	do	you	do	?	``	--	you	say	,	``	i	'm	a	 statistic 	 ian 	 	.	``
well	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	pre	-	 war 	 ned 	 	now	,	and	they	'll	know	you	're	making	it	up	.
and	then	one	of	two	 thing 	 s 	 	will	happen	.
they	'll	either	discover	 the 	 ir 	 	long	-	lost	cousin	in	the	other	corner	of	the	room	and	run	over	and	talk	to	them	.
or	they	'll	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 par 	 ch 	 ed 	 	and	/	or	 hung 	 ry 	 	--	and	often	both	--	and	 s 	 print 	 	off	for	a	drink	and	some	food	.
and	you	'll	be	left	in	peace	to	talk	to	the	person	you	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	talk	to	.
it	's	one	of	the	 challeng 	 es 	 	in	our	profession	to	try	and	explain	what	we	do	.
we	're	not	top	on	people	's	 list 	 s 	 	for	 d 	 inner 	 	party	 guest 	 s 	 	and	 conversation 	 s 	 	and	so	on	.
and	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	i	've	never	 re 	 ally 	 	found	a	good	way	of	 do 	 ing 	 	.
but	my	wife	--	who	was	then	my	girlfriend	--	 manage 	 d 	 	it	much	better	than	i	've	ever	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	.
 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	when	we	first	 start 	 ed 	 	going	out	,	she	was	 work 	 ing 	 	for	the	bbc	in	britain	,	and	i	was	,	at	that	stage	,	 work 	 ing 	 	in	america	.
i	was	coming	back	to	visit	her	.
she	told	 th 	 is 	 	to	one	of	her	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	,	who	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	your	boyfriend	do	?	``
sarah	thought	 quit 	 e 	 	hard	about	the	 thing 	 s 	 	i	'd	 explain 	 ed 	 	--	and	she	 concent 	 rated 	 	,	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 day 	 s 	 	,	on	 listen 	 ing 	 	.
do	n't	tell	her	i	 s 	 aid 	 	that	.
and	she	was	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	work	i	did	 develop 	 ing 	 	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 model 	 s 	 	for	 understand 	 ing 	 	evolution	and	modern	 genetic 	 s 	 	.
so	when	her	 col 	 league 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	 do 	 es 	 	he	do	?	``
she	 pause 	 d 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	he	 model 	 s 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.	``	well	,	her	 col 	 league 	 	 sudden 	 ly 	 	got	much	more	 interest 	 ed 	 	than	i	had	any	right	to	expect	and	went	on	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	 do 	 es 	 	he	model	?	``
well	,	sarah	thought	a	little	bit	more	about	my	work	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 gene 	 s 	 	.	``	``	he	 model 	 s 	 	 gene 	 s 	 	.	``
that	is	my	first	love	,	and	that	's	what	i	'll	tell	you	a	little	bit	about	.
what	i	want	to	do	more	 general 	 ly 	 	is	to	get	you	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	place	of	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	and	 random 	 ness 	 	and	chance	in	our	world	,	and	how	we	react	to	that	,	and	how	well	we	do	or	do	n't	think	about	it	.
so	you	've	had	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	easy	time	up	till	now	--	a	few	 laugh 	 s 	 	,	and	all	that	kind	of	thing	--	in	the	 talk 	 s 	 	to	date	.
you	've	got	to	think	,	and	i	'm	going	to	ask	you	some	 question 	 s 	 	.
so	here	's	the	scene	for	the	first	question	i	'm	going	to	ask	you	.
can	you	imagine	 to 	 s 	 s 	 ing 	 	a	 co 	 in 	 	 success 	 ively 	 	?	and	for	some	reason	--	which	 s 	 hall 	 	remain	 ra 	 ther 	 	vague	--	we	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	a	 part 	 icular 	 	pattern	.
here	's	one	--	a	head	,	 follow 	 ed 	 	by	a	tail	,	 follow 	 ed 	 	by	a	tail	.
so	suppose	we	 to 	 s 	 s 	 	a	 co 	 in 	 	 repeat 	 ed 	 ly 	 	.
then	the	pattern	,	head	-	tail	-	tail	,	that	we	've	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 fix 	 ated 	 	with	 happen 	 s 	 	here	.
and	you	can	count	:	one	,	two	,	three	,	four	,	five	,	six	,	seven	,	eight	,	nine	,	10	--	it	 happen 	 s 	 	after	the	10th	 to 	 s 	 s 	 	.
so	you	might	think	there	are	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	to	do	,	but	humor	me	for	the	moment	.
imagine	 th 	 is 	 	half	of	the	audience	each	get	out	 co 	 in 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 to 	 s 	 s 	 	them	 un 	 til 	 	they	first	see	the	pattern	head	-	tail	-	tail	.
the	first	time	they	do	it	,	 may 	 be 	 	it	 happen 	 s 	 	after	the	10th	 to 	 s 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	here	.
the	second	time	,	 may 	 be 	 	it	's	after	the	fourth	 to 	 s 	 s 	 	.
the	next	time	,	after	the	15th	 to 	 s 	 s 	 	.
so	you	do	that	 lot 	 s 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 time 	 s 	 	,	and	you	average	 t 	 hose 	 	 number 	 s 	 	.
that	's	what	i	want	 th 	 is 	 	side	to	think	about	.
the	other	half	of	the	audience	 do 	 es 	 	n't	like	head	-	tail	-	tail	--	they	think	,	for	deep	cultural	 reason 	 s 	 	,	that	's	 bor 	 ing 	 	--	and	they	're	much	more	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	a	different	pattern	--	head	-	tail	-	head	.
so	,	on	 th 	 is 	 	side	,	you	get	out	your	 co 	 in 	 s 	 	,	and	you	 to 	 s 	 s 	 	and	 to 	 s 	 s 	 	and	 to 	 s 	 s 	 	.
and	you	count	the	number	of	 time 	 s 	 	 un 	 til 	 	the	pattern	head	-	tail	-	head	 appear 	 s 	 	and	you	average	them	.	ok	?
so	on	 th 	 is 	 	side	,	you	've	got	a	number	--	you	've	 d 	 one 	 	it	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 time 	 s 	 	,	so	you	get	it	 accurate 	 ly 	 	--	which	is	the	average	number	of	 to 	 s 	 s 	 es 	 	 un 	 til 	 	head	-	tail	-	tail	.
on	 th 	 is 	 	side	,	you	've	got	a	number	--	the	average	number	of	 to 	 s 	 s 	 es 	 	 un 	 til 	 	head	-	tail	-	head	.
so	here	's	a	deep	 mathematic 	 al 	 	fact	--	if	you	've	got	two	 number 	 s 	 	,	one	of	three	 thing 	 s 	 	must	be	true	.
either	they	're	the	same	,	or	 th 	 is 	 	one	's	 big 	 ger 	 	than	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	or	 th 	 is 	 	one	's	 big 	 ger 	 	than	that	one	.
so	what	's	going	on	here	?
so	you	've	all	got	to	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	you	've	all	got	to	vote	--	and	we	're	not	moving	on	.
and	i	do	n't	want	to	end	up	in	the	two	-	minute	silence	to	give	you	more	time	to	think	about	it	,	 un 	 til 	 	 every 	 one 	 	's	 express 	 ed 	 	a	view	.	ok	.
so	what	you	want	to	do	is	 compar 	 e 	 	the	average	number	of	 to 	 s 	 s 	 es 	 	 un 	 til 	 	we	first	see	head	-	tail	-	head	with	the	average	number	of	 to 	 s 	 s 	 es 	 	 un 	 til 	 	we	first	see	head	-	tail	-	tail	.
who	 think 	 s 	 	that	a	is	true	--	that	,	on	average	,	it	'll	take	 long 	 er 	 	to	see	head	-	tail	-	head	than	head	-	tail	-	tail	?
who	 think 	 s 	 	that	b	is	true	--	that	on	average	,	they	're	the	same	?
who	 think 	 s 	 	that	c	is	true	--	that	,	on	average	,	it	'll	take	less	time	to	see	head	-	tail	-	head	than	head	-	tail	-	tail	?
ok	,	who	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 vot 	 ed 	 	yet	?	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 naught 	 y 	 	--	i	 s 	 aid 	 	you	had	to	.
ok	.	so	most	people	think	b	is	true	.
and	you	might	be	 reliev 	 ed 	 	to	know	even	 ra 	 ther 	 	 distinguish 	 ed 	 	 mathematic 	 ians 	 	think	that	.
it	's	not	.	a	is	true	here	.
it	 take 	 s 	 	 long 	 er 	 	,	on	average	.
in	fact	,	the	average	number	of	 to 	 s 	 s 	 es 	 	till	head	-	tail	-	head	is	10	and	the	average	number	of	 to 	 s 	 s 	 es 	 	 un 	 til 	 	head	-	tail	-	tail	is	eight	.
how	could	that	be	?
 any 	 thing 	 	different	about	the	two	 pattern 	 s 	 	?
there	is	.	head	-	tail	-	head	 over 	 lap 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	.
if	you	went	head	-	tail	-	head	-	tail	-	head	,	you	can	 cunn 	 ing 	 ly 	 	get	two	 occur 	 rence 	 s 	 	of	the	pattern	in	 on 	 ly 	 	five	 to 	 s 	 s 	 es 	 	.
you	ca	n't	do	that	with	head	-	tail	-	tail	.
that	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	be	 import 	 ant 	 	.
there	are	two	ways	of	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	'll	give	you	one	of	them	.
so	imagine	--	let	's	suppose	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
on	 th 	 is 	 	side	--	remember	,	you	're	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	head	-	tail	-	tail	;	you	're	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	head	-	tail	-	head	.
we	start	 to 	 s 	 s 	 ing 	 	a	 co 	 in 	 	,	and	we	get	a	head	--	and	you	start	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	on	the	edge	of	your	seat	 be 	 cause 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	great	and	 wonder 	 ful 	 	,	or	awesome	,	might	be	about	to	happen	.
the	next	 to 	 s 	 s 	 	is	a	tail	--	you	get	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	.
the	 champ 	 agne 	 	's	on	ice	just	next	to	you	;	you	've	got	the	 glass 	 es 	 	 chill 	 ed 	 	to	 celebr 	 ate 	 	.
you	're	 wait 	 ing 	 	with	bated	breath	for	the	final	 to 	 s 	 s 	 	.
and	if	it	 come 	 s 	 	down	a	head	,	that	's	great	.
you	're	 d 	 one 	 	,	and	you	 celebr 	 ate 	 	.
if	it	's	a	tail	--	well	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	disappointedly	,	you	put	the	 glass 	 es 	 	away	and	put	the	 champ 	 agne 	 	back	.
and	you	keep	 to 	 s 	 s 	 ing 	 	,	to	wait	for	the	next	head	,	to	get	 excit 	 ed 	 	.
on	 th 	 is 	 	side	,	there	's	a	different	experience	.
it	's	the	same	for	the	first	two	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	sequence	.
you	're	a	little	bit	 excit 	 ed 	 	with	the	first	head	--	you	get	 ra 	 ther 	 	more	 excit 	 ed 	 	with	the	next	tail	.
then	you	 to 	 s 	 s 	 	the	 co 	 in 	 	.
if	it	's	a	tail	,	you	crack	open	the	 champ 	 agne 	 	.
if	it	's	a	head	you	're	 disappoint 	 ed 	 	,	but	you	're	still	a	third	of	the	way	to	your	pattern	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	that	's	an	 inform 	 al 	 	way	of	 present 	 ing 	 	it	--	that	's	why	there	's	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	way	of	 think 	 ing 	 	about	it	--	if	we	 to 	 s 	 s 	 ed 	 	a	 co 	 in 	 	eight	million	 time 	 s 	 	,	then	we	'd	expect	a	million	head	-	tail	-	 head 	 s 	 	and	a	million	head	-	tail	-	 tail 	 s 	 	--	but	the	head	-	tail	-	 head 	 s 	 	could	occur	in	clumps	.
so	if	you	want	to	put	a	million	 thing 	 s 	 	down	 among 	 st 	 	eight	million	 position 	 s 	 	and	you	can	have	some	of	them	 over 	 lap 	 ping 	 	,	the	clumps	will	be	further	 a 	 part 	 	.
it	's	 an 	 other 	 	way	of	 get 	 ting 	 	the	 intuit 	 ion 	 	.
what	's	the	point	i	want	to	make	?
it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	an	 eas 	 ily 	 	 state 	 d 	 	question	in	 prob 	 ability 	 	,	which	every	--	you	're	in	good	company	--	 every 	 body 	 	 get 	 s 	 	wrong	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	my	little	 divers 	 ion 	 	 in 	 to 	 	my	real	 pass 	 ion 	 	,	which	is	 genetic 	 s 	 	.
there	's	a	 connect 	 ion 	 	between	head	-	tail	-	 head 	 s 	 	and	head	-	tail	-	 tail 	 s 	 	in	 genetic 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	.
when	you	 to 	 s 	 s 	 	a	 co 	 in 	 	,	you	get	a	sequence	of	 head 	 s 	 	and	 tail 	 s 	 	.
when	you	look	at	dna	,	there	's	a	sequence	of	not	two	 thing 	 s 	 	--	 head 	 s 	 	and	 tail 	 s 	 	--	but	four	 letter 	 s 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	,	gs	,	cs	and	ts	.
and	there	are	little	chemical	 s 	 cis 	 s 	 ors 	 	,	 call 	 ed 	 	 restrict 	 ion 	 	 enzyme 	 s 	 	which	cut	dna	 when 	 ever 	 	they	see	 part 	 icular 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	.
and	they	're	an	 enormous 	 ly 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	tool	in	modern	 mole 	 cular 	 	biology	.
and	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 ask 	 ing 	 	the	question	,	``	how	long	 un 	 til 	 	i	see	a	head	-	tail	-	head	?	``	--	you	can	ask	,	``	how	big	will	the	 chunk 	 s 	 	be	when	i	use	a	 restrict 	 ion 	 	enzyme	which	 cut 	 s 	 	 when 	 ever 	 	it	 s 	 ees 	 	g	-	a	-	a	-	g	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	?	how	long	will	 t 	 hose 	 	 chunk 	 s 	 	be	?	``
that	's	a	 ra 	 ther 	 	trivial	 connect 	 ion 	 	between	 prob 	 ability 	 	and	 genetic 	 s 	 	.
there	's	a	much	 deep 	 er 	 	 connect 	 ion 	 	,	which	i	do	n't	have	time	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	and	that	is	that	modern	 genetic 	 s 	 	is	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	area	of	science	.
and	we	'll	hear	some	 talk 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	in	the	 con 	 ference 	 	 specific 	 ally 	 	about	that	.
but	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	 un 	 lock 	 ing 	 	the	 secret 	 s 	 	in	the	information	generated	by	modern	 experiment 	 al 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	a	key	part	of	that	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	with	 fair 	 ly 	 	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	--	you	'll	be	 reliev 	 ed 	 	to	know	that	i	do	 some 	 thing 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	in	my	day	job	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	more	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	than	the	head	-	tail	-	head	story	--	but	 quit 	 e 	 	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	computer	modelings	and	 mathematic 	 al 	 	modelings	and	modern	 statistic 	 al 	 	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	.
and	i	will	give	you	two	little	 snip 	 pet 	 s 	 	--	two	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	--	of	 project 	 s 	 	we	're	 involve 	 d 	 	in	in	my	group	in	oxford	,	both	of	which	i	think	are	 ra 	 ther 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	.
you	know	about	the	human	genome	project	.
that	was	a	project	which	 aim 	 ed 	 	to	read	one	copy	of	the	human	genome	.
the	natural	thing	to	do	after	you	've	 d 	 one 	 	that	--	and	that	's	what	 th 	 is 	 	project	,	the	 inter 	 national 	 	hapmap	project	,	which	is	a	 collabor 	 ation 	 	between	 lab 	 s 	 	in	five	or	six	different	 count 	 ries 	 	.
think	of	the	human	genome	project	 a 	 s 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	what	we	've	got	in	common	,	and	the	hapmap	project	is	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	where	there	are	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	between	different	people	.
why	do	we	care	about	that	?
well	,	there	are	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 reason 	 s 	 	.
the	most	 press 	 ing 	 	one	is	that	we	want	to	understand	how	some	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	make	some	people	susceptible	to	one	disease	--	type	-	2	diabetes	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	--	and	other	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	make	people	more	susceptible	to	heart	disease	,	or	stroke	,	or	 aut 	 ism 	 	and	so	on	.
that	's	one	big	project	.
there	's	a	second	big	project	,
 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	funded	by	the	wellcome	trust	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	,	 in 	 vol 	 v 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	large	 stud 	 ies 	 	--	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 individual 	 s 	 	,	with	each	of	eight	different	 disease 	 s 	 	,	common	 disease 	 s 	 	like	type	-	1	and	type	-	2	diabetes	,	and	 cor 	 on 	 ary 	 	heart	disease	,	 bi 	 polar 	 	disease	and	so	on	--	to	try	and	understand	the	 genetic 	 s 	 	.
to	try	and	understand	what	it	is	about	genetic	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	that	 cause 	 s 	 	the	 disease 	 s 	 	.
why	do	we	want	to	do	that	?
 be 	 cause 	 	we	understand	 ver 	 y 	 	little	about	most	human	 disease 	 s 	 	.
we	do	n't	know	what	 cause 	 s 	 	them	.
and	if	we	can	get	in	at	the	bottom	and	understand	the	 genetic 	 s 	 	,	we	'll	have	a	window	on	the	way	the	disease	 work 	 s 	 	,
and	a	whole	new	way	about	 think 	 ing 	 	about	disease	 ther 	 a 	 pies 	 	and	 prevent 	 ative 	 	 treat 	 ment 	 	and	so	on	.
so	that	's	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	the	little	 divers 	 ion 	 	on	my	main	love	.
back	to	some	of	the	more	mundane	 issue 	 s 	 	of	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	.
here	's	 an 	 other 	 	quiz	for	you	--	now	suppose	we	've	got	a	test	for	a	disease	which	is	n't	infallible	,	but	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	.
it	 get 	 s 	 	it	right	99	percent	of	the	time	.
and	i	take	one	of	you	,	or	i	take	 some 	 one 	 	off	the	street	,	and	i	test	them	for	the	disease	in	question	.
let	's	suppose	there	's	a	test	for	hiv	--	the	virus	that	 cause 	 s 	 	 aid 	 s 	 	--	and	the	test	 say 	 s 	 	the	person	 ha 	 s 	 	the	disease	.
what	's	the	chance	that	they	do	?
the	test	 get 	 s 	 	it	right	99	percent	of	the	time	.
so	a	natural	answer	is	99	percent	.
who	 like 	 s 	 	that	answer	?
come	on	--	 every 	 one 	 	's	got	to	get	 involve 	 d 	 	.
do	n't	think	you	do	n't	trust	me	 any 	 more 	 	.
well	,	you	're	right	to	be	a	bit	 skeptic 	 al 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	not	the	answer	.
that	's	what	you	might	think	.
it	's	not	the	answer	,	and	it	's	not	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	part	of	the	story	.
it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 depend 	 s 	 	on	how	common	or	how	rare	the	disease	is	.
so	let	me	try	and	 illustr 	 ate 	 	that	.
here	's	a	little	 caricatur 	 e 	 	of	a	million	 individual 	 s 	 	.
so	let	's	think	about	a	disease	that	 affect 	 s 	 	--	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	rare	,	it	 affect 	 s 	 	one	person	in	10,000	.
 among 	 st 	 	these	million	 individual 	 s 	 	,	most	of	them	are	 health 	 y 	 	and	some	of	them	will	have	the	disease	.
and	in	fact	,	if	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 pre 	 valence 	 	of	the	disease	,	about	100	will	have	the	disease	and	the	rest	wo	n't	.
so	now	suppose	we	test	them	all	.
what	 happen 	 s 	 	?
well	,	 among 	 st 	 	the	100	who	do	have	the	disease	,	the	test	will	get	it	right	99	percent	of	the	time	,	and	99	will	test	positive	.
 among 	 st 	 	all	these	other	people	who	do	n't	have	the	disease	,	the	test	will	get	it	right	99	percent	of	the	time	.
it	'll	 on 	 ly 	 	get	it	wrong	one	percent	of	the	time	.
but	there	are	so	 man 	 y 	 	of	them	that	there	'll	be	an	enormous	number	of	false	 positive 	 s 	 	.
put	that	 an 	 other 	 	way	--	of	all	of	them	who	test	positive	--	so	here	they	are	,	the	 individual 	 s 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	--	less	than	one	in	100	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	the	disease	.
so	even	 th 	 ough 	 	we	think	the	test	is	accurate	,	the	 import 	 ant 	 	part	of	the	story	is	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	bit	of	information	we	need	.
here	's	the	key	 intuit 	 ion 	 	.
what	we	have	to	do	,	once	we	know	the	test	is	positive	,	is	to	weigh	up	the	 pla 	 us 	 ibility 	 	,	or	the	 like 	 li 	 hood 	 	,	of	two	 com 	 pet 	 ing 	 	 explan 	 ations 	 	.
each	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 explan 	 ations 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 like 	 ly 	 	bit	and	an	 un 	 like 	 ly 	 	bit	.
one	 explan 	 ation 	 	is	that	the	person	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	the	disease	--	that	's	 overwhelm 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 like 	 ly 	 	,	if	you	pick	 some 	 one 	 	at	random	--	but	the	test	 get 	 s 	 	it	wrong	,	which	is	 un 	 like 	 ly 	 	.
the	other	 explan 	 ation 	 	is	that	the	person	 do 	 es 	 	have	the	disease	--	that	's	 un 	 like 	 ly 	 	--	but	the	test	 get 	 s 	 	it	right	,	which	is	 like 	 ly 	 	.
and	the	number	we	end	up	with	--	that	number	which	is	a	little	bit	less	than	one	in	100	--	is	to	do	with	how	 like 	 ly 	 	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 explan 	 ations 	 	is	 relat 	 ive 	 	to	the	other	.
each	of	them	taken	together	is	 un 	 like 	 ly 	 	.
here	's	a	more	 top 	 ical 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	thing	.
 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	in	britain	will	know	about	what	's	 be 	 come 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	a	 celebr 	 ated 	 	case	of	a	woman	 call 	 ed 	 	sally	clark	,	who	had	two	 bab 	 ies 	 	who	 di 	 ed 	 	 sudden 	 ly 	 	.
and	 initi 	 ally 	 	,	it	was	thought	that	they	 di 	 ed 	 	of	what	's	known	 inform 	 ally 	 	 a 	 s 	 	``	cot	death	,	``	and	more	 form 	 ally 	 	 a 	 s 	 	``	sudden	infant	death	syndrome	.	``	for	 vari 	 ous 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	,	she	was	 lat 	 er 	 	charged	with	murder	.
and	at	the	trial	,	her	trial	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 distinguish 	 ed 	 	 pediatric 	 ian 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	evidence	that	the	chance	of	two	cot	 death 	 s 	 	,	 innoc 	 ent 	 	 death 	 s 	 	,	in	a	family	like	 her 	 s 	 	--	which	was	professional	and	non	-	 smok 	 ing 	 	--	was	one	in	73	million	.
to	cut	a	long	story	short	,	she	was	 convict 	 ed 	 	at	the	time	.
 lat 	 er 	 	,	and	 fair 	 ly 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	acquitted	on	appeal	--	in	fact	,	on	the	second	appeal	.
and	just	to	set	it	in	 con 	 text 	 	,	you	can	imagine	how	awful	it	is	for	 some 	 one 	 	to	have	lost	one	child	,	and	then	two	,	if	they	're	 innoc 	 ent 	 	,	to	be	 convict 	 ed 	 	of	 murder 	 ing 	 	them	.
to	be	put	through	the	stress	of	the	trial	,	 convict 	 ed 	 	of	 murder 	 ing 	 	them	--	and	to	 s 	 pend 	 	time	in	a	women	's	 pri 	 son 	 	,	where	all	the	other	 prisoner 	 s 	 	think	you	 kill 	 ed 	 	your	children	--	is	a	 re 	 ally 	 	awful	thing	to	happen	to	 some 	 one 	 	.
and	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	large	part	here	 be 	 cause 	 	the	expert	got	the	 statistic 	 s 	 	 horr 	 ibly 	 	wrong	,	in	two	different	ways	.
so	where	did	he	get	the	one	in	73	million	number	?
he	 look 	 ed 	 	at	some	research	,	which	 s 	 aid 	 	the	chance	of	one	cot	death	in	a	family	like	sally	clark	's	is	about	one	in	8,500	.
so	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'll	 assum 	 e 	 	that	if	you	have	one	cot	death	in	a	family	,	the	chance	of	a	second	child	 dy 	 ing 	 	from	cot	death	are	n't	 change 	 d 	 	.	``
so	that	's	what	 statistic 	 ians 	 	would	call	an	assumption	of	 in 	 depend 	 ence 	 	.
it	's	like	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	if	you	 to 	 s 	 s 	 	a	 co 	 in 	 	and	get	a	head	the	first	time	,	that	wo	n't	affect	the	chance	of	 get 	 ting 	 	a	head	the	second	time	.	``
so	if	you	 to 	 s 	 s 	 	a	 co 	 in 	 	twice	,	the	chance	of	 get 	 ting 	 	a	head	twice	are	a	half	--	that	's	the	chance	the	first	time	--	 time 	 s 	 	a	half	--	the	chance	a	second	time	.
so	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	here	,	i	'll	 assum 	 e 	 	that	these	 event 	 s 	 	are	 in 	 dependent 	 	.
when	you	 multi 	 ply 	 	8,500	together	twice	,	you	get	about	73	million	.	``
and	 non 	 e 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	was	 state 	 d 	 	to	the	court	 a 	 s 	 	an	assumption	or	 present 	 ed 	 	to	the	jury	that	way	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	here	--	and	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	regrettably	--	first	of	all	,	in	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	you	'd	have	to	 ver 	 ify 	 	it	 empir 	 ically 	 	.
and	 second 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	 palp 	 ably 	 	false	.
there	are	 lot 	 s 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	do	n't	know	about	sudden	infant	 death 	 s 	 	.
it	might	well	be	that	there	are	 environment 	 al 	 	 factor 	 s 	 	that	we	're	not	aware	of	,	and	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	 like 	 ly 	 	to	be	the	case	that	there	are	genetic	 factor 	 s 	 	we	're	not	aware	of	.
so	if	a	family	 suffer 	 s 	 	from	one	cot	death	,	you	'd	put	them	in	a	high	-	risk	group	.
they	've	 prob 	 ably 	 	got	these	 environment 	 al 	 	risk	 factor 	 s 	 	and	/	or	genetic	risk	 factor 	 s 	 	we	do	n't	know	about	.
and	to	 argu 	 e 	 	,	then	,	that	the	chance	of	a	second	death	is	 a 	 s 	 	if	you	did	n't	know	that	information	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 il 	 ly 	 	.
it	's	 wo 	 rse 	 	than	 s 	 il 	 ly 	 	--	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	science	.
 non 	 e 	 the 	 less 	 	,	that	's	how	it	was	 present 	 ed 	 	,	and	at	trial	 no 	 body 	 	even	 argu 	 ed 	 	it	.
that	's	the	first	problem	.
the	second	problem	is	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	the	number	of	one	in	73	million	mean	?
so	after	sally	clark	was	 convict 	 ed 	 	--	you	can	imagine	,	it	made	 ra 	 ther 	 	a	splash	in	the	press	--	one	of	the	 journalist 	 s 	 	from	one	of	britain	's	more	 re 	 put 	 able 	 	 news 	 paper 	 s 	 	wrote	that	what	the	expert	had	 s 	 aid 	 	was	,	``	the	chance	that	she	was	 innoc 	 ent 	 	was	one	in	73	million	.	``
now	,	that	's	a	logical	error	.
it	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	logical	error	 a 	 s 	 	the	logical	error	of	 think 	 ing 	 	that	after	the	disease	test	,	which	is	99	percent	accurate	,	the	chance	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	disease	is	99	percent	.
in	the	disease	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	we	had	to	bear	in	mind	two	 thing 	 s 	 	,	one	of	which	was	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	that	the	test	got	it	right	or	not	.
and	the	other	one	was	the	chance	,	a	priori	,	that	the	person	had	the	disease	or	not	.
it	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	in	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 text 	 	.
there	are	two	 thing 	 s 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	--	two	 part 	 s 	 	to	the	 explan 	 ation 	 	.
we	want	to	know	how	 like 	 ly 	 	,	or	 relat 	 ively 	 	how	 like 	 ly 	 	,	two	different	 explan 	 ations 	 	are	.
one	of	them	is	that	sally	clark	was	 innoc 	 ent 	 	--	which	is	,	a	priori	,	 overwhelm 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 like 	 ly 	 	--	most	 mother 	 s 	 	do	n't	kill	 the 	 ir 	 	children	.
and	the	second	part	of	the	 explan 	 ation 	 	is	that	she	 suffer 	 ed 	 	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 un 	 like 	 ly 	 	event	.
not	 a 	 s 	 	 un 	 like 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	one	in	73	million	,	but	 non 	 e 	 the 	 less 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	 un 	 like 	 ly 	 	.
the	other	 explan 	 ation 	 	is	that	she	was	 guilt 	 y 	 	.	now	,	we	 prob 	 ably 	 	think	a	priori	that	's	 un 	 like 	 ly 	 	.
and	we	 certain 	 ly 	 	should	think	in	the	 con 	 text 	 	of	a	criminal	trial	that	that	's	 un 	 like 	 ly 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	presumption	of	 innoc 	 ence 	 	.
and	then	if	she	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	kill	the	children	,	she	 succeed 	 ed 	 	.
so	the	chance	that	she	's	 innoc 	 ent 	 	is	n't	one	in	73	million	.
we	do	n't	know	what	it	is	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	with	 weigh 	 ing 	 	up	the	strength	of	the	other	evidence	against	her	and	the	 statistic 	 al 	 	evidence	.
we	know	the	children	 di 	 ed 	 	.
what	 matter 	 s 	 	is	how	 like 	 ly 	 	or	 un 	 like 	 ly 	 	,	 relat 	 ive 	 	to	each	other	,	the	two	 explan 	 ations 	 	are	.
and	they	're	both	 im 	 plausible 	 	.
there	's	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	where	 error 	 s 	 	in	 statistic 	 s 	 	had	 re 	 ally 	 	 pro 	 found 	 	and	 re 	 ally 	 	 un 	 fortunate 	 	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	there	are	two	other	women	who	 we 	 re 	 	 convict 	 ed 	 	on	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	the	evidence	of	 th 	 is 	 	 pediatric 	 ian 	 	,	who	have	 sub 	 sequent 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	released	on	appeal	.
 man 	 y 	 	 case 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 review 	 ed 	 	.
and	it	's	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 top 	 ical 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	he	's	 current 	 ly 	 	facing	a	disrepute	charge	at	britain	's	general	medical	council	.
so	just	to	conclude	--	what	are	the	take	-	home	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	?
well	,	we	know	that	 random 	 ness 	 	and	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	and	chance	are	 ver 	 y 	 	much	a	part	of	our	 every 	 day 	 	life	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	true	--	and	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	,	you	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 collect 	 ive 	 	,	are	 ver 	 y 	 	special	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	,	you	're	 complete 	 ly 	 	typical	in	not	 get 	 ting 	 	the	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	i	 g 	 ave 	 	right	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	well	 document 	 ed 	 	that	people	get	 thing 	 s 	 	wrong	.
they	make	 error 	 s 	 	of	logic	in	 reason 	 ing 	 	with	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	.
we	can	cope	with	the	 subtle 	 ties 	 	of	language	 brilli 	 ant 	 ly 	 	--	and	there	are	 interest 	 ing 	 	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 question 	 s 	 	about	how	we	got	here	.
we	are	not	good	at	 reason 	 ing 	 	with	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	.
that	's	an	issue	in	our	 every 	 day 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	've	heard	from	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 talk 	 s 	 	,	 statistic 	 s 	 	 under 	 pin 	 s 	 	an	enormous	amount	of	research	in	science	--	in	social	science	,	in	medicine	and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	 quit 	 e 	 	a	lot	of	industry	.
all	of	quality	control	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	had	a	major	impact	on	industrial	 process 	 ing 	 	,	is	 under 	 pin 	 ned 	 	by	 statistic 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	we	're	bad	at	 do 	 ing 	 	.
at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 l 	 east 	 	,	we	should	 recogn 	 ize 	 	that	,	and	we	tend	not	to	.
to	go	back	to	the	legal	 con 	 text 	 	,	at	the	sally	clark	trial	all	of	the	 lawyer 	 s 	 	just	 accept 	 ed 	 	what	the	expert	 s 	 aid 	 	.
so	if	a	 pediatric 	 ian 	 	had	come	out	and	 s 	 aid 	 	to	a	jury	,	``	i	know	how	to	build	 bridge 	 s 	 	.	i	've	built	one	down	the	road	.
 pleas 	 e 	 	drive	your	car	home	over	it	,	``	they	would	have	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	 pediatric 	 ians 	 	do	n't	know	how	to	build	 bridge 	 s 	 	.
that	's	what	 engineer 	 s 	 	do	.	``
on	the	other	hand	,	he	came	out	and	 effective 	 ly 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	or	implied	,	``	i	know	how	to	reason	with	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	.	i	know	how	to	do	 statistic 	 s 	 	.	``
and	 every 	 one 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	that	's	fine	.	he	's	an	expert	.	``
so	we	need	to	understand	where	our	 compete 	 nce 	 	is	and	is	n't	.
 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 issue 	 s 	 	 a 	 rose 	 	in	the	early	 day 	 s 	 	of	dna	 pro 	 filing 	 	,	when	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	and	 lawyer 	 s 	 	and	in	some	 case 	 s 	 	 judg 	 es 	 	,	 routine 	 ly 	 	misrepresented	evidence	.
 usual 	 ly 	 	--	one	 hope 	 s 	 	--	 innoc 	 ent 	 ly 	 	,	but	misrepresented	evidence	.
forensic	 scientist 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	the	chance	that	 th 	 is 	 	guy	's	 innoc 	 ent 	 	is	one	in	three	million	.	``
even	if	you	 believ 	 e 	 	the	number	,	just	like	the	73	million	to	one	,	that	's	not	what	it	 me 	 ant 	 	.
and	there	have	 be 	 en 	 	 celebr 	 ated 	 	appeal	 case 	 s 	 	in	britain	and	 else 	 where 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	that	.
and	just	to	finish	in	the	 con 	 text 	 	of	the	legal	system	.	it	's	all	 ver 	 y 	 	well	to	say	,	``	let	's	do	our	best	to	present	the	evidence	.	``
but	more	and	more	,	in	 case 	 s 	 	of	dna	 pro 	 filing 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	one	--	we	expect	juries	,	who	are	 ordin 	 ary 	 	people	--	and	it	's	 document 	 ed 	 	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	bad	at	 th 	 is 	 	--	we	expect	juries	to	be	able	to	cope	with	the	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 reason 	 ing 	 	that	 go 	 es 	 	on	.
in	other	 sphere 	 s 	 	of	life	,	if	people	 argu 	 ed 	 	--	well	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	possibly	for	 politic 	 s 	 	--
but	in	other	 sphere 	 s 	 	of	life	,	if	people	 argu 	 ed 	 	illogically	,	we	'd	say	that	's	not	a	good	thing	.
we	sort	of	expect	it	of	 politic 	 ians 	 	and	do	n't	hope	for	much	more	.
in	the	case	of	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	,	we	get	it	wrong	all	the	time	--	and	at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 l 	 east 	 	,	we	should	be	aware	of	that	,
and	 ideal 	 ly 	 	,	we	might	try	and	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	it	.
 thank 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
