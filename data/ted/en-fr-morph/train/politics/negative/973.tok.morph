i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 fascinate 	 d 	 	for	a	 life 	 time 	 	by	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	,	form	and	function	of	giant	 blue 	 fin 	 	tuna	.
 blue 	 fin 	 	are	 warm 	 blood 	 ed 	 	like	us	.
they	're	the	largest	of	the	 tuna 	 s 	 	,	the	second	-	largest	fish	in	the	sea	--	 bon 	 y 	 	fish	.
they	 actual 	 ly 	 	are	a	fish	that	is	 endo 	 thermic 	 	--	 power 	 s 	 	through	the	ocean	with	warm	 muscle 	 s 	 	like	a	mammal	.
that	's	one	of	our	 blue 	 fin 	 	at	the	monterey	 ba 	 y 	 	 aqua 	 rium 	 	.	you	can	see	in	 it 	 s 	 	shape	and	 it 	 s 	 	 stream 	 lined 	 	design	it	's	powered	for	ocean	 swimm 	 ing 	 	.
it	flies	through	the	ocean	on	 it 	 s 	 	pectoral	 fin 	 s 	 	,	 get 	 s 	 	lift	,	 power 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 move 	 ments 	 	with	a	 lun 	 ate 	 	tail	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	got	a	naked	skin	for	most	of	 it 	 s 	 	body	,	so	it	 reduc 	 es 	 	friction	with	the	water	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	one	of	nature	's	 fin 	 est 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	.
now	,	 blue 	 fin 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 revere 	 d 	 	by	man	for	all	of	human	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
for	4,000	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	 fish 	 ed 	 	 sustain 	 ably 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	animal	,	and	it	's	 evidence 	 d 	 	in	the	art	that	we	see	from	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.	 blue 	 fin 	 	are	in	cave	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	in	france	.
they	're	on	 co 	 in 	 s 	 	that	date	back	3,000	 year 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	fish	was	 revere 	 d 	 	by	 human 	 kind 	 	.
it	was	 fish 	 ed 	 	 sustain 	 ably 	 	till	all	of	time	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	our	generation	.
 blue 	 fin 	 	are	 pursue 	 d 	 	 where 	 ver 	 	they	go	--
there	is	a	gold	rush	on	earth	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	gold	rush	for	 blue 	 fin 	 	.
there	are	 trap 	 s 	 	that	fish	 sustain 	 ably 	 	up	 un 	 til 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	.
and	yet	,	the	type	of	 fish 	 ing 	 	going	on	 to 	 day 	 	,	with	 pen 	 s 	 	,	with	enormous	 s 	 take 	 s 	 	,	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 wi 	 ping 	 	 blue 	 fin 	 	 eco 	 logically 	 	off	the	planet	.
now	 blue 	 fin 	 	,	in	general	,	 go 	 es 	 	to	one	place	:	japan	.	some	of	you	may	be	 guilt 	 y 	 	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	 con 	 tribute 	 d 	 	to	the	 de 	 mise 	 	of	 blue 	 fin 	 	.
they	're	 d 	 elect 	 able 	 	muscle	,	rich	in	fat	--	 absolute 	 ly 	 	taste	 delic 	 ious 	 	.
and	that	's	 the 	 ir 	 	problem	;	we	're	eating	them	to	death	.
now	in	the	atlantic	,	the	story	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	simple	.
 blue 	 fin 	 	have	two	 population 	 s 	 	:	one	large	,	one	small	.
the	north	american	population	is	 fish 	 ed 	 	at	about	2,000	ton	.
the	european	population	and	north	african	--	the	eastern	 blue 	 fin 	 	tuna	--	is	 fish 	 ed 	 	at	tremendous	 level 	 s 	 	:	50,000	 ton 	 s 	 	over	the	last	decade	 al 	 most 	 	every	year	.
the	result	is	 whet 	 her 	 	you	're	looking	at	the	west	or	the	eastern	 blue 	 fin 	 	population	,	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	tremendous	decline	on	both	 side 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	90	percent	if	you	go	back	with	your	 base 	 line 	 	to	1950	.
for	that	,	 blue 	 fin 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 give 	 n 	 	a	 stat 	 us 	 	 equi 	 valent 	 	to	 tiger 	 s 	 	,	to	 lion 	 s 	 	,	to	certain	african	 elephant 	 s 	 	and	to	 pan 	 da 	 s 	 	.
these	fish	have	 be 	 en 	 	 pro 	 posed 	 	for	an	 en 	 danger 	 ed 	 	species	 list 	 ing 	 	in	the	past	two	 month 	 s 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 vot 	 ed 	 	on	and	 reject 	 ed 	 	just	two	 week 	 s 	 	ago	,	 de 	 spite 	 	 out 	 stand 	 ing 	 	science	that	 show 	 s 	 	from	two	 commit 	 tee 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	fish	 meet 	 s 	 	the	 cri 	 ter 	 ia 	 	of	 cite 	 s 	 	i	.
and	if	it	's	 tuna 	 s 	 	you	do	n't	care	about	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	you	might	be	 interest 	 ed 	 	that	 inter 	 national 	 	long	lines	and	 pur 	 s 	 ing 	 	chase	down	 tuna 	 s 	 	and	 by 	 catch 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 leather 	 back 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	,	 mar 	 lin 	 	,	 al 	 batross 	 	.
these	 animal 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 de 	 mise 	 	 occur 	 s 	 	in	the	tuna	 fish 	 eries 	 	.
the	 challeng 	 e 	 	we	face	is	that	we	know	 ver 	 y 	 	little	about	tuna	,	and	 every 	 one 	 	in	the	room	 know 	 s 	 	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	when	an	african	lion	 take 	 s 	 	down	 it 	 s 	 	 pre 	 y 	 	.
i	doubt	 any 	 one 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 een 	 	a	giant	 blue 	 fin 	 	feed	.
 th 	 is 	 	tuna	 symbol 	 ize 	 s 	 	what	's	the	problem	for	all	of	us	in	the	room	.
it	's	the	21st	century	,	but	we	 re 	 ally 	 	have	 on 	 ly 	 	just	 beg 	 un 	 	to	 re 	 ally 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	our	 ocean 	 s 	 	in	a	deep	way	.
technology	 ha 	 s 	 	come	of	age	that	's	 allow 	 ing 	 	us	to	see	the	earth	from	space	and	go	deep	 in 	 to 	 	the	 sea 	 s 	 	 remote 	 ly 	 	.
and	we	've	got	to	use	these	 techno 	 logies 	 	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	to	get	a	better	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	how	our	ocean	realm	 work 	 s 	 	.
most	of	us	from	the	ship	--	even	i	--	look	out	at	the	ocean	and	see	 th 	 is 	 	 homogen 	 eous 	 	sea	.
we	do	n't	know	where	the	structure	is	.
we	ca	n't	tell	where	are	the	 water 	 ing 	 	 hole 	 s 	 	like	we	can	on	an	african	plain	.	we	ca	n't	see	the	 corridor 	 s 	 	,	and	we	ca	n't	see	what	it	is	that	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	together	a	tuna	,	a	 leather 	 back 	 	and	an	 al 	 batross 	 	.
we	're	 on 	 ly 	 	just	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	understand	how	the	physical	 ocean 	 ography 	 	and	the	 bio 	 logical 	 	 ocean 	 ography 	 	come	together	to	create	a	 season 	 al 	 	force	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 cause 	 s 	 	the	 up 	 well 	 ing 	 	that	might	make	a	hot	spot	a	hope	spot	.
the	 reason 	 s 	 	these	 challeng 	 es 	 	are	great	is	that	 technical 	 ly 	 	it	's	difficult	to	go	to	sea	.
it	's	hard	to	 stud 	 y 	 	a	 blue 	 fin 	 	on	 it 	 s 	 	turf	,	the	entire	 pac 	 ific 	 	realm	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	tough	to	get	up	close	and	personal	with	a	mako	 s 	 hark 	 	and	try	to	put	a	tag	on	it	.
and	then	imagine	 be 	 ing 	 	bruce	mate	's	team	from	osu	,	 get 	 ting 	 	up	close	to	a	blue	whale	and	 fix 	 ing 	 	a	tag	on	the	blue	whale	that	 stay 	 s 	 	,	an	 engineer 	 ing 	 	 challeng 	 e 	 	we	've	yet	to	 re 	 ally 	 	 over 	 come 	 	.
so	the	story	of	our	team	,	a	 dedicate 	 d 	 	team	,	is	fish	and	 chip 	 s 	 	.
we	 bas 	 ically 	 	are	taking	the	same	satellite	phone	 part 	 s 	 	,	or	the	same	 part 	 s 	 	that	are	in	your	computer	,	 chip 	 s 	 	.
we	're	 put 	 ting 	 	them	together	in	 un 	 usual 	 	ways	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	taking	us	 in 	 to 	 	the	ocean	realm	like	never	before	.
and	for	the	first	time	,	we	're	able	to	watch	the	journey	of	a	tuna	 be 	 neath 	 	the	ocean	using	light	and	 photo 	 ns 	 	to	measure	 s 	 un 	 rise 	 	and	 s 	 un 	 set 	 	.
now	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	with	 tuna 	 s 	 	for	over	15	 year 	 s 	 	.
i	have	the	privilege	of	 be 	 ing 	 	a	partner	with	the	monterey	 ba 	 y 	 	 aqua 	 rium 	 	.
we	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	taken	a	 s 	 liver 	 	of	the	ocean	,	put	it	 be 	 hind 	 	glass	,	and	we	together	have	put	 blue 	 fin 	 	tuna	and	 yellow 	 fin 	 	tuna	on	 dis 	 play 	 	.
when	the	veil	of	 bubble 	 s 	 	 lift 	 s 	 	every	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	a	community	from	the	 pel 	 agic 	 	ocean	,	one	of	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 place 	 s 	 	on	earth	you	can	see	giant	 blue 	 fin 	 	swim	by	.
we	can	see	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 beaut 	 y 	 	of	form	and	function	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 cease 	 less 	 	activity	.
they	're	 fly 	 ing 	 	through	 the 	 ir 	 	space	,	ocean	space	.
and	we	can	 br 	 ing 	 	two	million	people	a	year	 in 	 to 	 	contact	with	 th 	 is 	 	fish	and	show	them	 it 	 s 	 	 beaut 	 y 	 	.
 be 	 hind 	 	the	 scene 	 s 	 	is	a	 work 	 ing 	 	lab	at	stanford	university	 partner 	 ed 	 	with	the	monterey	 ba 	 y 	 	 aqua 	 rium 	 	.
here	,	for	over	14	or	15	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	in	both	 blue 	 fin 	 	and	 yellow 	 fin 	 	in	 captiv 	 ity 	 	.
we	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	these	fish	,
but	first	we	had	to	learn	how	to	 husband 	 ry 	 	them	.
what	do	they	like	to	eat	?
what	is	it	that	they	're	happy	with	?
we	go	in	the	 tank 	 s 	 	with	the	tuna	--	we	touch	 the 	 ir 	 	naked	skin	--
it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.	it	 feel 	 s 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	.
and	then	,	better	yet	,	we	've	got	our	own	version	of	tuna	 whisper 	 ers 	 	,	our	own	chuck	farwell	,	alex	norton	,	who	can	take	a	big	tuna	and	in	one	motion	,	put	it	 in 	 to 	 	an	 envelop 	 e 	 	of	water	,	so	that	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	work	with	the	tuna	and	learn	the	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	it	 take 	 s 	 	to	not	 inju 	 re 	 	 th 	 is 	 	fish	who	never	 s 	 ees 	 	a	 bound 	 ary 	 	in	the	open	sea	.
jeff	and	jason	there	,	are	 scientist 	 s 	 	who	are	going	to	take	a	tuna	and	put	it	in	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	a	 tread 	 mill 	 	,	a	 flu 	 me 	 	.
and	that	tuna	 think 	 s 	 	it	's	going	to	japan	,	but	it	's	 stay 	 ing 	 	in	place	.
we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 measur 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	oxygen	consumption	,	 it 	 s 	 	energy	consumption	.
we	're	taking	 th 	 is 	 	data	and	building	better	 model 	 s 	 	.
and	when	i	see	that	tuna	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	view	--	i	begin	to	wonder	:	how	did	 th 	 is 	 	fish	solve	the	 long 	 itude 	 	problem	before	we	did	?
so	take	a	look	at	that	animal	.
that	's	the	 close 	 st 	 	you	'll	 prob 	 ably 	 	ever	get	.
now	,	the	 activ 	 ities 	 	from	the	lab	have	taught	us	now	how	to	go	out	in	the	open	ocean	.
so	in	a	program	 call 	 ed 	 	tag	-	a	-	giant	we	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	gone	from	ireland	to	canada	,	from	corsica	to	spain	.
we	've	 fish 	 ed 	 	with	 man 	 y 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	around	the	world	in	an	effort	to	 bas 	 ically 	 	put	 electron 	 ic 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	giant	 tuna 	 s 	 	.
we	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	 tag 	 ged 	 	1,100	 tuna 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'm	going	to	show	you	three	 clip 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 tag 	 ged 	 	1,100	 tuna 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	process	,	but	it	's	a	ballet	.
we	 br 	 ing 	 	the	tuna	out	,	we	measure	it	.
a	team	of	 fish 	 ers 	 	,	 cap 	 tain 	 s 	 	,	 scientist 	 s 	 	and	 technician 	 s 	 	work	together	to	keep	 th 	 is 	 	animal	out	of	the	ocean	for	about	four	to	five	 minute 	 s 	 	.
we	put	water	over	 it 	 s 	 	 gill 	 s 	 	,	give	it	oxygen	.
and	then	with	a	lot	of	effort	,	after	 tag 	 ging 	 	,	 put 	 ting 	 	in	the	computer	,	making	 s 	 ure 	 	the	 s 	 talk 	 	is	 stick 	 ing 	 	out	so	it	 sense 	 s 	 	the	environment	,	we	 s 	 end 	 	 th 	 is 	 	fish	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	sea	.
and	when	it	 go 	 es 	 	,	we	're	 al 	 ways 	 	happy	.
we	see	a	flick	of	the	tail	.
and	from	our	data	that	 get 	 s 	 	 collect 	 ed 	 	,	when	that	tag	 come 	 s 	 	back	,	 be 	 cause 	 	a	 fish 	 er 	 	 return 	 s 	 	it	for	a	thousand	-	dollar	reward	,	we	can	get	 track 	 s 	 	 be 	 neath 	 	the	sea	for	up	to	five	 year 	 s 	 	now	,	on	a	 back 	 bon 	 ed 	 	animal	.
now	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	the	 tuna 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	large	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	fish	off	nantucket	.
but	that	's	about	half	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	 big 	 gest 	 	tuna	we	've	ever	 tag 	 ged 	 	.
it	 take 	 s 	 	a	human	effort	,	a	team	effort	,	to	 br 	 ing 	 	the	fish	in	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	what	we	're	going	to	do	is	put	a	pop	-	up	satellite	 archiv 	 al 	 	tag	on	the	tuna	.
 th 	 is 	 	tag	 ride 	 s 	 	on	the	tuna	,	 sense 	 s 	 	the	environment	around	the	tuna	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	will	come	off	the	fish	,	detach	,	float	to	the	surface	and	 s 	 end 	 	back	to	earth	-	 orbit 	 ing 	 	 satellite 	 s 	 	position	data	 estimate 	 d 	 	by	math	on	the	tag	,	pressure	data	and	temperature	data	.
and	so	what	we	get	then	from	the	pop	-	up	satellite	tag	is	we	get	away	from	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	have	a	human	 interact 	 ion 	 	to	 re 	 capture 	 	the	tag	.
both	the	 electron 	 ic 	 	 tag 	 s 	 	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	are	expensive	.
these	 tag 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	engineered	by	a	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 team 	 s 	 	in	north	america	.
they	are	some	of	our	 fin 	 est 	 	 instrument 	 s 	 	,	our	new	technology	in	the	ocean	 to 	 day 	 	.
one	community	in	general	 ha 	 s 	 	 give 	 n 	 	more	to	help	us	than	any	other	community	.
and	that	's	the	 fish 	 eries 	 	off	the	state	of	north	carolina	.
there	are	two	 village 	 s 	 	,	harris	and	morehead	city	,	every	winter	for	over	a	decade	,	held	a	party	 call 	 ed 	 	tag	-	a	-	giant	,	and	together	,	 fish 	 ers 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	with	us	to	tag	800	to	900	fish	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	to	measure	the	fish	.
we	're	going	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	that	in	 re 	 cent 	 	 year 	 s 	 	we	've	 start 	 ed 	 	:	take	a	 mu 	 cus 	 	 s 	 ample 	 	.
watch	how	 shin 	 y 	 	the	skin	is	;	you	can	see	my	 reflect 	 ion 	 	there	.
and	from	that	 mu 	 cus 	 	,	we	can	get	gene	 profile 	 s 	 	,
we	can	get	information	on	gender	,	 check 	 ing 	 	the	pop	-	up	tag	one	more	time	,	and	then	it	's	out	in	the	ocean	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	.
with	the	help	of	my	 form 	 er 	 	 post 	 doc 	 	,	gareth	lawson	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 gorge 	 ous 	 	picture	of	a	single	tuna	.
 th 	 is 	 	tuna	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	moving	on	a	 numeric 	 al 	 	ocean	.
the	warm	is	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	stream	,	the	cold	up	there	in	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	of	maine	.
that	's	where	the	tuna	 want 	 s 	 	to	go	--	it	 want 	 s 	 	to	 for 	 age 	 	on	 school 	 s 	 	of	 her 	 ring 	 	--
but	it	ca	n't	get	there	.	it	's	too	cold	.
but	then	it	 warm 	 s 	 	up	,	and	the	tuna	 pop 	 s 	 	in	,	 get 	 s 	 	some	fish	,	 may 	 be 	 	 come 	 s 	 	back	to	home	base	,	 go 	 es 	 	in	 aga 	 in 	 	and	then	 come 	 s 	 	back	to	winter	down	there	in	north	carolina	and	then	on	to	the	bahamas	.
and	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	scene	,	three	 tuna 	 s 	 	going	 in 	 to 	 	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	of	mexico	.
three	 tuna 	 s 	 	 tag 	 ged 	 	.
 astronomical 	 ly 	 	,	we	're	 calcul 	 ating 	 	 position 	 s 	 	.
they	're	coming	together	.	that	could	be	tuna	 s 	 ex 	 	--
and	there	it	is	.
that	is	where	the	tuna	spawn	.
so	from	data	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	're	able	now	to	put	the	map	up	,	and	in	 th 	 is 	 	map	you	see	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 position 	 s 	 	generated	by	 th 	 is 	 	decade	and	a	half	of	 tag 	 ging 	 	.
and	now	we	're	 show 	 ing 	 	that	 tuna 	 s 	 	on	the	western	side	go	to	the	eastern	side	.
so	two	 population 	 s 	 	of	 tuna 	 s 	 	--	that	is	,	we	have	a	 gu 	 lf 	 	population	,	one	that	we	can	tag	--	they	go	to	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	of	mexico	,	i	 show 	 ed 	 	you	that	--	and	a	second	population	.
living	 among 	 st 	 	our	 tuna 	 s 	 	--	our	north	american	 tuna 	 s 	 	--	are	european	 tuna 	 s 	 	that	go	back	to	the	med	.
on	the	hot	 spot 	 s 	 	--	the	hope	 spot 	 s 	 	--	they	're	 mix 	 ed 	 	 population 	 s 	 	.
and	so	what	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	with	the	science	is	we	're	 show 	 ing 	 	the	 inter 	 national 	 	commission	,	building	new	 model 	 s 	 	,	 show 	 ing 	 	them	that	a	two	-	stock	no	-	 mix 	 ing 	 	model	--	to	 th 	 is 	 	day	,	used	to	reject	the	 cite 	 s 	 	 treat 	 y 	 	--	that	model	is	n't	the	right	model	.
 th 	 is 	 	model	,	a	model	of	 over 	 lap 	 	,	is	the	way	to	move	forward	.
so	we	can	then	predict	where	management	 place 	 s 	 	should	be	.
 place 	 s 	 	like	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	of	mexico	and	the	mediterranean	are	 place 	 s 	 	where	the	single	species	,	the	single	population	,	can	be	 capture 	 d 	 	.
these	 be 	 come 	 	 forth 	 right 	 	in	 place 	 s 	 	we	need	to	protect	.
the	center	of	the	atlantic	where	the	 mix 	 ing 	 	is	,	i	could	imagine	a	policy	that	lets	canada	and	america	fish	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	manage	 the 	 ir 	 	 fish 	 eries 	 	well	,	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	a	good	job	.
but	in	the	 inter 	 national 	 	realm	,	where	 fish 	 ing 	 	and	 over 	 fish 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	gone	wild	,	these	are	the	 place 	 s 	 	that	we	have	to	make	hope	 spot 	 s 	 	in	.	that	's	the	 s 	 ize 	 	they	have	to	be	to	protect	the	 blue 	 fin 	 	tuna	.
now	in	a	second	project	 call 	 ed 	 	 tag 	 ging 	 	of	 pac 	 ific 	 	pelagics	,	we	took	on	the	planet	 a 	 s 	 	a	team	,	 t 	 hose 	 	of	us	in	the	census	of	marine	life	.
and	,	funded	 prim 	 arily 	 	through	sloan	 found 	 ation 	 	and	 other 	 s 	 	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	go	in	,	in	our	project	--	we	're	one	of	17	field	 program 	 s 	 	and	begin	to	take	on	 tag 	 ging 	 	large	 number 	 s 	 	of	 predator 	 s 	 	,	not	just	 tuna 	 s 	 	.
so	what	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	gone	up	to	tag	 s 	 al 	 mon 	 	 s 	 hark 	 	in	alaska	,	met	 s 	 al 	 mon 	 	 s 	 hark 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	home	 territ 	 ory 	 	,	 follow 	 ed 	 	them	 catch 	 ing 	 	 s 	 al 	 mon 	 	and	then	went	in	and	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	that	,	if	we	take	a	 s 	 al 	 mon 	 	and	put	it	on	a	line	,	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	take	up	a	 s 	 al 	 mon 	 	 s 	 hark 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	cousin	of	the	white	 s 	 hark 	 	--	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 care 	 fully 	 	--	note	,	i	say	``	 ver 	 y 	 	 care 	 fully 	 	,	``	--	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	keep	it	calm	,	put	a	hose	in	 it 	 s 	 	mouth	,	keep	it	off	the	deck	and	then	tag	it	with	a	satellite	tag	.
that	satellite	tag	will	now	have	your	 s 	 hark 	 	phone	home	and	 s 	 end 	 	in	a	 mess 	 age 	 	.
and	that	 s 	 hark 	 	 leap 	 ing 	 	there	,	if	you	look	 care 	 fully 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	an	antenna	.
it	's	a	free	 swimm 	 ing 	 	 s 	 hark 	 	with	a	satellite	tag	 jump 	 ing 	 	after	 s 	 al 	 mon 	 	,	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	home	 it 	 s 	 	data	.
 s 	 al 	 mon 	 	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	are	n't	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	we	tag	.
but	there	 go 	 es 	 	 s 	 al 	 mon 	 	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	meter	-	level	 re 	 solution 	 	on	an	ocean	of	temperature	--	warm	 color 	 s 	 	are	 warm 	 er 	 	.
 s 	 al 	 mon 	 	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	go	down	to	the	 tropic 	 s 	 	to	pup	and	come	 in 	 to 	 	monterey	.
now	right	next	door	in	monterey	and	up	at	the	farallones	are	a	white	 s 	 hark 	 	team	led	by	scott	anderson	--	there	--	and	sal	jorgensen	.
they	can	throw	out	a	target	--	it	's	a	carpet	shaped	like	a	seal	--	and	in	will	come	a	white	 s 	 hark 	 	,	a	 cur 	 ious 	 	critter	that	will	come	right	up	to	our	16	-	ft.	boat	.
it	's	a	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	thousand	-	pound	animal	.
and	we	'll	wind	in	the	target	.
and	we	'll	place	an	acoustic	tag	that	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	omshark	10165	,	``	or	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	,	 acoustic 	 ally 	 	with	a	ping	.
and	then	we	'll	put	on	a	satellite	tag	that	will	give	us	the	long	-	distance	 journey 	 s 	 	with	the	light	-	based	 geo 	 location 	 	 algorithm 	 s 	 	 solve 	 d 	 	on	the	computer	that	's	on	the	fish	.
so	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	sal	's	looking	at	two	 tag 	 s 	 	there	,
and	there	they	are	:	the	white	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	of	california	going	off	to	the	white	 s 	 hark 	 	cafe	and	coming	back	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	tag	 mako 	 s 	 	with	our	noaa	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	,	blue	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	.
and	now	,	together	,	what	we	can	see	on	 th 	 is 	 	ocean	of	color	that	's	temperature	,	we	can	see	ten	-	day	 worm 	 s 	 	of	 mako 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 al 	 mon 	 	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	.
we	have	white	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	and	blue	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	.
for	the	first	time	,	an	 eco 	 s 	 cape 	 	 a 	 s 	 	large	 a 	 s 	 	ocean	-	scale	,	 show 	 ing 	 	where	the	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	go	.
the	tuna	team	from	topp	 ha 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	the	 un 	 think 	 able 	 	:	three	 team 	 s 	 	 tag 	 ged 	 	1,700	 tuna 	 s 	 	,	 blue 	 fin 	 	,	 yellow 	 fin 	 	and	 al 	 ba 	 core 	 	all	at	the	same	time	--	 care 	 fully 	 	 rehears 	 ed 	 	 tag 	 ging 	 	 program 	 s 	 	in	which	we	go	out	,	pick	up	juvenile	 tuna 	 s 	 	,	put	in	the	 tag 	 s 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	the	 sensor 	 s 	 	,	stick	out	the	tuna	and	then	let	them	go	.
they	get	 return 	 ed 	 	,	and	when	they	get	 return 	 ed 	 	,	here	on	a	nasa	 numeric 	 al 	 	ocean	you	can	see	 blue 	 fin 	 	in	blue	go	 a 	 cross 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	corridor	,	 return 	 ing 	 	to	the	western	 pac 	 ific 	 	.
our	team	from	ucsc	 ha 	 s 	 	 tag 	 ged 	 	elephant	 seal 	 s 	 	with	 tag 	 s 	 	that	are	 glu 	 ed 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 head 	 s 	 	,	that	come	off	when	they	 s 	 l 	 ough 	 	.
these	elephant	 seal 	 s 	 	cover	half	an	ocean	,	take	data	down	to	1,800	feet	--	 amaz 	 ing 	 	data	.
and	then	there	's	scott	shaffer	and	our	 s 	 hear 	 water 	 s 	 	 wear 	 ing 	 	tuna	 tag 	 s 	 	,	light	-	based	 tag 	 s 	 	,	that	now	are	going	to	take	you	from	new	zealand	to	monterey	and	back	,	 journey 	 s 	 	of	35,000	 naut 	 ical 	 	 mile 	 s 	 	we	had	never	 s 	 een 	 	before	.
but	now	with	light	-	based	 geo 	 location 	 	 tag 	 s 	 	that	are	 ver 	 y 	 	small	,	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	these	 journey 	 s 	 	.
same	thing	with	laysan	 al 	 batross 	 	who	travel	an	entire	ocean	on	a	trip	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	up	to	the	same	zone	the	 tuna 	 s 	 	use	.
you	can	see	why	they	might	be	caught	.
then	there	's	george	schillinger	and	our	 leather 	 back 	 	team	out	of	playa	grande	 tag 	 ging 	 	 leather 	 back 	 s 	 	that	go	right	past	where	we	are	.
and	scott	benson	's	team	that	 show 	 ed 	 	that	 leather 	 back 	 s 	 	go	from	indonesia	all	the	way	to	monterey	.
so	what	we	can	see	on	 th 	 is 	 	moving	ocean	is	we	can	 final 	 ly 	 	see	where	the	 predator 	 s 	 	are	.
we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	how	they	're	using	 eco 	 space 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	large	 a 	 s 	 	an	ocean	.
and	from	 th 	 is 	 	information	,	we	can	begin	to	map	the	hope	 spot 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	three	 year 	 s 	 	of	data	right	here	--
and	there	's	a	decade	of	 th 	 is 	 	data	.
we	see	the	 puls 	 e 	 	and	the	 season 	 al 	 	 activ 	 ities 	 	that	these	 animal 	 s 	 	are	going	on	.
so	what	we	're	able	to	do	with	 th 	 is 	 	information	is	boil	it	down	to	hot	 spot 	 s 	 	,	4,000	 deploy 	 ments 	 	,	a	huge	 her 	 cule 	 an 	 	task	,	2,000	 tag 	 s 	 	in	an	area	,	 show 	 n 	 	here	for	the	first	time	,	off	the	california	coast	,
that	 appear 	 s 	 	to	be	a	 gather 	 ing 	 	place	.
and	then	for	sort	of	an	 en 	 core 	 	from	these	 animal 	 s 	 	,	they	're	 help 	 ing 	 	us	.
they	're	 carry 	 ing 	 	 instrument 	 s 	 	that	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	taking	data	down	to	2,000	 meter 	 s 	 	.
they	're	taking	information	from	our	planet	at	 ver 	 y 	 	critical	 place 	 s 	 	like	antarctica	and	the	 pole 	 s 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	are	 seal 	 s 	 	from	 man 	 y 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	released	who	are	 s 	 ampl 	 ing 	 	 under 	 neath 	 	the	ice	 sheet 	 s 	 	and	giving	us	temperature	data	of	 ocean 	 o 	 graphic 	 	quality	on	both	 pole 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	data	,	when	 visual 	 ized 	 	,	is	 captiv 	 ating 	 	to	watch	.
we	still	have	n't	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	best	how	to	 visual 	 ize 	 	the	data	.
and	then	,	 a 	 s 	 	these	 animal 	 s 	 	swim	and	give	us	the	information	that	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	climate	 issue 	 s 	 	,	we	 al 	 so 	 	think	it	's	critical	to	get	 th 	 is 	 	information	to	the	public	,
to	engage	the	public	with	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	data	.
we	did	 th 	 is 	 	with	the	great	turtle	race	--	 tag 	 ged 	 	 turtle 	 s 	 	,	 br 	 ought 	 	in	four	million	 hit 	 s 	 	.
and	now	with	google	's	 ocean 	 s 	 	,
we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	put	a	white	 s 	 hark 	 	in	that	ocean	.
and	when	we	do	and	it	 swim 	 s 	 	,	we	see	 th 	 is 	 	 magnific 	 ent 	 	 bath 	 y 	 metry 	 	that	the	 s 	 hark 	 	 know 	 s 	 	is	there	on	 it 	 s 	 	path	 a 	 s 	 	it	 go 	 es 	 	from	california	to	hawaii	.
but	 may 	 be 	 	mission	blue	can	fill	in	that	ocean	that	we	ca	n't	see	.
we	've	got	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	,	nasa	 ha 	 s 	 	the	ocean	.
we	just	need	to	put	it	together	.
so	in	 con 	 clusion 	 	,	we	know	where	yellowstone	is	for	north	america	;	it	's	off	our	coast	.
we	have	the	technology	that	's	 show 	 n 	 	us	where	it	is	.
what	we	need	to	think	about	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	for	mission	blue	is	increasing	the	 bio 	 logging 	 	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	.
how	is	it	that	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	take	 th 	 is 	 	type	of	activity	 else 	 where 	 	?
and	then	 final 	 ly 	 	--	to	 bas 	 ically 	 	get	the	 mess 	 age 	 	home	--	 may 	 be 	 	use	live	 link 	 s 	 	from	 animal 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	blue	 whale 	 s 	 	and	white	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	.
make	killer	 app 	 s 	 	,	if	you	will	.
a	lot	of	people	are	 excit 	 ed 	 	when	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	went	under	the	 gold 	 en 	 	gate	bridge	.
let	's	connect	the	public	to	 th 	 is 	 	activity	right	on	 the 	 ir 	 	iphone	.
that	way	we	do	away	with	a	few	 inter 	 net 	 	 myth 	 s 	 	.
so	we	can	 s 	 ave 	 	the	 blue 	 fin 	 	tuna	.
we	can	 s 	 ave 	 	the	white	 s 	 hark 	 	.
we	have	the	science	and	technology	.
hope	is	here	.	 y 	 es 	 	we	can	.
we	need	just	to	 app 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	further	in	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	.
thank	you	.
