my	journey	to	coming	here	 to 	 day 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	in	1974	.
that	's	me	with	the	funny	 glove 	 s 	 	.
i	was	17	and	going	on	a	peace	walk	.
what	i	did	n't	know	 th 	 ough 	 	,	was	most	of	 t 	 hose 	 	people	,	 stand 	 ing 	 	there	with	me	,	 we 	 re 	 	moonies	.
and	 with 	 in 	 	a	week	i	had	come	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	the	second	coming	of	christ	had	 occur 	 red 	 	,	that	it	was	 s 	 un 	 	myung	moon	,	and	that	i	had	 be 	 en 	 	 special 	 ly 	 	 chose 	 n 	 	and	prepared	by	god	to	be	his	 discip 	 le 	 	.
now	 a 	 s 	 	cool	 a 	 s 	 	that	 sound 	 s 	 	,	my	family	was	not	that	 thrill 	 ed 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	they	 tri 	 ed 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	they	could	to	get	me	out	of	there	.
there	was	an	 under 	 ground 	 	 rail 	 road 	 	of	 sort 	 s 	 	that	was	going	on	 dur 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 year 	 s 	 	.	 may 	 be 	 	some	of	you	remember	it	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 de 	 programm 	 ers 	 	.
and	after	about	five	long	 year 	 s 	 	my	family	had	me	 de 	 programm 	 ed 	 	.
and	i	then	 be 	 came 	 	a	 de 	 programm 	 er 	 	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	going	out	on	 case 	 s 	 	.
and	after	about	five	 year 	 s 	 	of	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	was	 arrest 	 ed 	 	for	 kidnap 	 ping 	 	.
most	of	the	 case 	 s 	 	i	went	out	on	 we 	 re 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 in 	 voluntary 	 	.
what	 happen 	 ed 	 	was	that	the	family	had	to	get	 the 	 ir 	 	 love 	 d 	 	 one 	 s 	 	some	safe	place	 some 	 how 	 	.
and	so	they	took	them	to	some	safe	place	.
and	we	would	come	in	and	talk	to	them	,	 usual 	 ly 	 	for	about	a	week	.
and	so	after	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	i	 decide 	 d 	 	it	was	a	good	time	to	turn	my	back	on	 th 	 is 	 	work	.
and	about	20	 year 	 s 	 	went	by	.
there	was	a	 burn 	 ing 	 	question	 th 	 ough 	 	that	would	not	 leav 	 e 	 	me	.	and	that	was	,	``	how	did	 th 	 is 	 	happen	to	me	?	``
and	in	fact	,	what	did	happen	to	my	brain	?
 be 	 cause 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	did	.
and	so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	write	a	book	,	a	memoir	,	about	 th 	 is 	 	decade	of	my	life	.
and	 to 	 ward 	 	the	end	of	writing	that	book	there	was	a	 document 	 ary 	 	that	came	out	.	it	was	on	jonestown	.
and	it	had	a	 chill 	 ing 	 	effect	on	me	.
these	are	the	dead	in	jonestown	.
about	900	people	 di 	 ed 	 	that	day	,
most	of	them	taking	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 live 	 s 	 	.
women	 g 	 ave 	 	poison	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 bab 	 ies 	 	,	and	 watch 	 ed 	 	foam	come	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 mouth 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	 di 	 ed 	 	.
the	top	picture	is	a	group	of	moonies	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	 bless 	 ed 	 	by	 the 	 ir 	 	 mess 	 iah 	 	.
 the 	 ir 	 	 mate 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 chose 	 n 	 	for	them	.
the	bottom	picture	is	hitler	youth	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	leg	of	a	 su 	 icide 	 	 bomb 	 er 	 	.
the	thing	i	had	to	admit	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	with	great	 re 	 pulsion 	 	,
was	that	i	get	it	.
i	understand	how	 th 	 is 	 	could	happen	.
i	understand	how	 some 	 one 	 	's	brain	,	how	 some 	 one 	 	's	mind	can	come	to	the	place	where	it	 make 	 s 	 	sense	--
in	fact	it	would	be	wrong	,	when	your	brain	is	 work 	 ing 	 	like	that	--	not	to	try	to	 s 	 ave 	 	the	world	through	genocide	.
and	so	what	is	 th 	 is 	 	?	how	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	work	?
and	how	i	've	come	to	view	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	me	is	a	viral	,	 meme 	 tic 	 	 infect 	 ion 	 	.
for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	are	n't	familiar	with	 meme 	 tics 	 	,	a	meme	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	defined	 a 	 s 	 	an	idea	that	 replicate 	 s 	 	in	the	human	brain	and	 move 	 s 	 	from	brain	to	brain	like	a	virus	,
much	like	a	virus	.	the	way	a	virus	 work 	 s 	 	is	--	it	can	infect	and	do	the	most	damage	to	 some 	 one 	 	who	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 com 	 promise 	 d 	 	 immun 	 e 	 	system	.
in	1974	,	i	was	young	,	i	was	naive	,	and	i	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	lost	in	my	world	.
i	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 ideal 	 istic 	 	.
these	easy	 idea 	 s 	 	to	complex	 question 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 appeal 	 ing 	 	when	you	are	 emotion 	 ally 	 	 vulner 	 able 	 	.
what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	that	 circul 	 ar 	 	logic	 take 	 s 	 	over	.	``	moon	is	one	with	god	.	god	is	going	to	fix	all	the	 problem 	 s 	 	in	the	world	.	all	i	have	to	do	is	 hum 	 bly 	 	follow	.	 be 	 cause 	 	god	is	going	to	stop	war	and	 hung 	 er 	 	--	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	--
all	i	have	to	do	is	 hum 	 bly 	 	follow	.
 be 	 cause 	 	after	all	,	god	is	[	 work 	 ing 	 	through	]	the	 mess 	 iah 	 	.	he	's	going	to	fix	all	 th 	 is 	 	.	``
it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 impenetr 	 able 	 	.	and	the	most	 danger 	 ous 	 	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	is	 create 	 s 	 	``	us	``	and	``	them	,	``	``	right	``	and	``	wrong	,	``	``	good	``	and	``	 e 	 vil 	 	.	``	and	it	 make 	 s 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	possible	,	 make 	 s 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	 rational 	 izable 	 	.
and	the	thing	is	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	if	you	 look 	 ed 	 	at	my	brain	 dur 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 year 	 s 	 	in	the	moonies	--	 neuro 	 science 	 	is	 expand 	 ing 	 	 exponential 	 ly 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	ray	kurzweil	 s 	 aid 	 	 yester 	 day 	 	.	science	is	 expand 	 ing 	 	.
we	're	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	look	 in 	 side 	 	the	brain	.
and	so	if	you	 look 	 ed 	 	at	my	brain	,	or	any	brain	that	's	 infect 	 ed 	 	with	a	viral	 meme 	 tic 	 	 infect 	 ion 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	 compar 	 ed 	 	it	to	 any 	 one 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	or	 any 	 one 	 	who	uses	critical	 think 	 ing 	 	on	a	regular	 bas 	 is 	 	,	i	am	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	it	would	look	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	different	.
and	that	,	strange	 a 	 s 	 	it	may	sound	,	 give 	 s 	 	me	hope	.
and	the	reason	that	 give 	 s 	 	me	hope	is	that	the	first	thing	is	to	admit	that	we	have	a	problem	.
but	it	's	a	human	problem	.	it	's	a	scientific	problem	,	if	you	will	.
it	 happen 	 s 	 	in	the	human	brain	.	there	is	no	 e 	 vil 	 	force	out	there	to	get	us	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	,	through	research	and	education	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	we	can	solve	.
and	so	the	first	step	is	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	we	can	do	 th 	 is 	 	together	,
and	that	there	is	no	``	us	``	and	``	them	.	``
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
