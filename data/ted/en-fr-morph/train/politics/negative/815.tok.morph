now	,	i	want	to	start	with	a	question	:	when	was	the	last	time	you	 we 	 re 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 child 	 ish 	 	?
for	 kid 	 s 	 	like	me	,	 be 	 ing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 child 	 ish 	 	can	be	a	frequent	 occur 	 rence 	 	.
every	time	we	make	irrational	 demand 	 s 	 	,	exhibit	 ir 	 respons 	 ible 	 	behavior	or	 dis 	 play 	 	any	other	 sign 	 s 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	normal	american	 citizen 	 s 	 	,	we	are	 call 	 ed 	 	 child 	 ish 	 	.	which	 re 	 ally 	 	 both 	 ers 	 	me	.
after	all	,	take	a	look	at	these	 event 	 s 	 	:	 imperial 	 ism 	 	and	 colon 	 ization 	 	,	world	 war 	 s 	 	,	george	w.	bush	.
ask	 your 	 self 	 	,	who	's	 respons 	 ible 	 	?	 adult 	 s 	 	.
now	,	what	have	 kid 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	?
well	,	anne	frank	 touch 	 ed 	 	 million 	 s 	 	with	her	 power 	 ful 	 	account	of	the	 holo 	 caus 	 t 	 	,	ruby	 bridge 	 s 	 	 help 	 ed 	 	to	end	 s 	 egreg 	 ation 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	and	,	most	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	charlie	simpson	 help 	 ed 	 	to	raise	120,000	 pound 	 s 	 	for	 ha 	 iti 	 	on	his	little	bike	.
so	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	 evidence 	 d 	 	by	 s 	 uch 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	,	age	 ha 	 s 	 	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	it	.
the	 trait 	 s 	 	the	word	 child 	 ish 	 	 address 	 es 	 	are	 s 	 een 	 	so	often	in	 adult 	 s 	 	that	we	should	abolish	 th 	 is 	 	age	-	discriminatory	word	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	 critic 	 izing 	 	behavior	 associate 	 d 	 	with	 ir 	 respons 	 ibility 	 	and	irrational	 think 	 ing 	 	.
thank	you	.
then	 aga 	 in 	 	,	who	's	to	say	that	certain	 type 	 s 	 	of	irrational	 think 	 ing 	 	are	n't	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	the	world	 need 	 s 	 	?
 may 	 be 	 	you	've	had	grand	 plan 	 s 	 	before	but	 stop 	 ped 	 	 your 	 self 	 	,	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	that	's	 im 	 possible 	 	,	``	or	,	``	that	 cost 	 s 	 	too	much	,	``	or	,	``	that	wo	n't	benefit	me	.	``
for	better	or	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	we	 kid 	 s 	 	are	n't	 ham 	 per 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 reason 	 s 	 	why	not	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 kid 	 s 	 	can	be	full	of	inspiring	 aspir 	 ations 	 	and	 hope 	 ful 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	.	like	my	wish	that	no	one	went	 hung 	 ry 	 	or	that	 every 	 thing 	 	 we 	 re 	 	a	free	kind	of	utopia	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	still	dream	like	that	and	 believ 	 e 	 	in	the	 possibil 	 ities 	 	?
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	a	knowledge	of	 histo 	 ry 	 	and	the	past	 failure 	 s 	 	of	 utopia 	 n 	 	 ideal 	 s 	 	can	be	a	burden	 be 	 cause 	 	you	know	that	if	 every 	 thing 	 	 we 	 re 	 	free	,	then	the	food	 stock 	 s 	 	would	 be 	 come 	 	 deplete 	 d 	 	and	scarce	and	lead	to	 cha 	 os 	 	.
on	the	other	hand	,	we	 kid 	 s 	 	still	dream	about	 perfect 	 ion 	 	.
and	that	's	a	good	thing	 be 	 cause 	 	in	order	to	make	 any 	 thing 	 	a	 re 	 ality 	 	,	you	have	to	dream	about	it	first	.
in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	,	our	 au 	 da 	 city 	 	to	imagine	 help 	 s 	 	push	the	 bound 	 aries 	 	of	 possibil 	 ity 	 	.
for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	the	museum	of	glass	in	tacoma	,	washington	,	my	home	state	--	yoohoo	washington	!	--	 ha 	 s 	 	a	program	 call 	 ed 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	design	glass	,	and	 kid 	 s 	 	draw	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 idea 	 s 	 	for	glass	art	.
now	,	the	resident	artist	 s 	 aid 	 	they	got	some	of	 the 	 ir 	 	best	 idea 	 s 	 	through	the	program	 be 	 cause 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	do	n't	think	about	the	 limit 	 ations 	 	of	how	hard	it	can	be	to	blow	glass	 in 	 to 	 	certain	 shape 	 s 	 	;
they	just	think	of	good	 idea 	 s 	 	.
now	,	when	you	think	of	glass	,	you	might	think	of	 color 	 ful 	 	chihuly	 design 	 s 	 	or	 may 	 be 	 	italian	 vase 	 s 	 	,	but	 kid 	 s 	 	 challeng 	 e 	 	glass	 artist 	 s 	 	to	go	beyond	that	 in 	 to 	 	the	realm	of	broken	-	hearted	 snake 	 s 	 	and	 ba 	 con 	 	 boy 	 s 	 	,	who	you	can	see	 ha 	 s 	 	meat	vision	.
now	,	our	inherent	 wis 	 dom 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	to	be	 insid 	 er 	 	's	knowledge	.
 kid 	 s 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	do	a	lot	of	 learn 	 ing 	 	from	 adult 	 s 	 	,	and	we	have	a	lot	to	share	.
i	think	that	 adult 	 s 	 	should	start	 learn 	 ing 	 	from	 kid 	 s 	 	.
now	,	i	do	most	of	my	 s 	 peaking 	 	in	front	of	an	education	crowd	,	 teacher 	 s 	 	and	 student 	 s 	 	,	and	i	like	 th 	 is 	 	 analog 	 y 	 	:
it	should	n't	just	be	a	teacher	at	the	head	of	the	 class 	 room 	 	 tell 	 ing 	 	 student 	 s 	 	,	``	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	do	that	.	``
the	 student 	 s 	 	should	teach	 the 	 ir 	 	 teacher 	 s 	 	.
 learn 	 ing 	 	between	grown	 up 	 s 	 	and	 kid 	 s 	 	should	be	 reciproc 	 al 	 	.
the	 re 	 ality 	 	,	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	is	a	little	different	,	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	lot	to	do	with	trust	,	or	a	lack	of	it	.
now	,	if	you	do	n't	trust	 some 	 one 	 	,	you	place	 restrict 	 ions 	 	on	them	,	right	?
if	i	doubt	my	 old 	 er 	 	sister	's	ability	to	pay	back	the	10	percent	interest	i	 establish 	 ed 	 	on	her	last	loan	,	i	'm	going	to	 with 	 hold 	 	her	ability	to	get	more	money	from	me	 un 	 til 	 	she	 pay 	 s 	 	it	back	.
true	story	,	by	the	way	.
now	,	 adult 	 s 	 	seem	to	have	a	 pre 	 valent 	 ly 	 	 restrict 	 ive 	 	attitude	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	from	every	``	do	n't	do	that	,	do	n't	do	 th 	 is 	 	``	in	the	school	 hand 	 book 	 	to	 restrict 	 ions 	 	on	school	 inter 	 net 	 	use	.
 a 	 s 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	 point 	 s 	 	out	,	 regime 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 oppress 	 ive 	 	when	they	're	 fear 	 ful 	 	about	 keep 	 ing 	 	control	.
and	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	 adult 	 s 	 	may	not	be	 quit 	 e 	 	at	the	level	of	 total 	 itarian 	 	 regime 	 s 	 	,	 kid 	 s 	 	have	no	,	or	 ver 	 y 	 	little	say	in	making	the	 rule 	 s 	 	,	when	 re 	 ally 	 	the	attitude	should	be	 reciproc 	 al 	 	,	meaning	that	the	adult	population	should	learn	and	take	 in 	 to 	 	account	the	 wish 	 es 	 	of	the	 young 	 er 	 	population	.
now	,	what	's	even	 wo 	 rse 	 	than	 restrict 	 ion 	 	is	that	 adult 	 s 	 	often	 under 	 estimate 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	abilities	.
we	love	 challeng 	 es 	 	,	but	when	 expect 	 ations 	 	are	low	,	trust	me	,	we	will	sink	to	them	.
my	own	 parent 	 s 	 	had	 any 	 thing 	 	but	low	 expect 	 ations 	 	for	me	and	my	sister	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	they	did	n't	tell	us	to	 be 	 come 	 	 doctor 	 s 	 	or	 lawyer 	 s 	 	or	 any 	 thing 	 	like	that	,	but	my	dad	did	read	to	us	about	aristotle	and	pioneer	germ	 fight 	 ers 	 	when	 lot 	 s 	 	of	other	 kid 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 hear 	 ing 	 	``	the	 wheel 	 s 	 	on	the	bus	go	round	and	round	.	``
well	,	we	heard	that	one	too	,	but	``	pioneer	germ	 fight 	 ers 	 	``	 total 	 ly 	 	 rule 	 s 	 	.
i	 love 	 d 	 	to	write	from	the	age	of	four	,	and	when	i	was	six	my	mom	 b 	 ought 	 	me	my	own	 lap 	 top 	 	 equi 	 pped 	 	with	 micro 	 soft 	 	word	.
thank	you	bill	 gate 	 s 	 	and	thank	you	ma	.
i	wrote	over	300	short	 st 	 ories 	 	on	that	little	 lap 	 top 	 	,	and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	get	 publish 	 ed 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	just	 s 	 coffin 	 g 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	 here 	 s 	 y 	 	that	a	kid	 want 	 ed 	 	to	get	 publish 	 ed 	 	or	 say 	 ing 	 	wait	 un 	 til 	 	you	're	 old 	 er 	 	,	my	 parent 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 support 	 ive 	 	.	 man 	 y 	 	 publish 	 ers 	 	 we 	 re 	 	not	 quit 	 e 	 	so	 encourag 	 ing 	 	,
one	large	children	's	 publish 	 er 	 	 iron 	 ically 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	that	they	did	n't	work	with	children	--
children	's	 publish 	 er 	 	not	 work 	 ing 	 	with	children	?
i	do	n't	know	,	you	're	kind	of	 alien 	 ating 	 	a	large	client	there	.
now	,	one	 publish 	 er 	 	,	action	 publish 	 ing 	 	,	was	 will 	 ing 	 	to	take	that	leap	and	trust	me	and	to	listen	to	what	i	had	to	say	.
they	 publish 	 ed 	 	my	first	book	,	``	 fly 	 ing 	 	 finger 	 s 	 	,	``	--	you	see	it	here	--	and	from	there	on	,	it	's	gone	to	 s 	 peaking 	 	at	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 school 	 s 	 	,	 key 	 not 	 ing 	 	to	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 educ 	 ators 	 	and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	 to 	 day 	 	,	 s 	 peaking 	 	to	you	.
i	appreciate	your	attention	 to 	 day 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	to	show	that	you	 tru 	 ly 	 	care	,	you	listen	.
but	there	's	a	problem	with	 th 	 is 	 	 ros 	 y 	 	picture	of	 kid 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	so	much	better	than	 adult 	 s 	 	.
 kid 	 s 	 	grow	up	and	 be 	 come 	 	 adult 	 s 	 	just	like	you	.
or	just	like	you	?	 re 	 ally 	 	?
the	goal	is	not	to	turn	 kid 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	your	kind	of	adult	,	but	 ra 	 ther 	 	better	 adult 	 s 	 	than	you	have	 be 	 en 	 	,	which	may	be	a	little	 challeng 	 ing 	 	 consider 	 ing 	 	your	 guy 	 s 	 	'	credentials	.	but	the	way	progress	 happen 	 s 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	new	 generation 	 s 	 	and	new	 era 	 s 	 	grow	and	develop	and	 be 	 come 	 	better	than	the	previous	 one 	 s 	 	.
it	's	the	reason	we	're	not	in	the	dark	 age 	 s 	 	 any 	 more 	 	.
no	matter	your	position	or	place	in	life	,	it	is	 imper 	 ative 	 	to	create	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	for	children	so	that	we	can	grow	up	to	blow	you	away	.
 adult 	 s 	 	and	fellow	tedsters	,	you	need	to	listen	and	learn	from	 kid 	 s 	 	and	trust	us	and	expect	more	from	us	.
you	must	lend	an	ear	 to 	 day 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	are	the	 lead 	 ers 	 	of	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	we	're	going	to	be	taking	care	of	you	when	you	're	old	and	 s 	 en 	 ile 	 	.	no	,	just	 kid 	 d 	 ing 	 	.
no	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	we	are	going	to	be	the	next	generation	,	the	 one 	 s 	 	who	will	 br 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	world	forward	.
and	in	case	you	do	n't	think	that	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	meaning	for	you	,	remember	that	 clon 	 ing 	 	is	possible	,	and	that	 involve 	 s 	 	going	through	 child 	 hood 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	,	in	which	case	you	'll	want	to	be	heard	just	like	my	generation	.
now	,	the	world	 need 	 s 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	for	new	 lead 	 ers 	 	and	new	 idea 	 s 	 	.
 kid 	 s 	 	need	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	to	lead	and	succeed	.
are	you	ready	to	make	the	match	?
 be 	 cause 	 	the	world	's	 problem 	 s 	 	should	n't	be	the	human	family	's	 heir 	 loom 	 	.
thank	you	.
thank	you	.	thank	you	.
