i	'm	a	 neuro 	 scientist 	 	.
and	in	 neuro 	 science 	 	,	we	have	to	deal	with	 man 	 y 	 	difficult	 question 	 s 	 	about	the	brain	.
but	i	want	to	start	with	the	 eas 	 iest 	 	question	and	the	question	you	 re 	 ally 	 	should	have	all	 ask 	 ed 	 	 your 	 s 	 elves 	 	at	some	point	in	your	life	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	a	fundamental	question	if	we	want	to	understand	brain	function	.
and	that	is	,	why	do	we	and	other	 animal 	 s 	 	have	 brain 	 s 	 	?
not	all	species	on	our	planet	have	 brain 	 s 	 	,	so	if	we	want	to	know	what	the	brain	is	for	,	let	's	think	about	why	we	 evolv 	 ed 	 	one	.
now	you	may	reason	that	we	have	one	to	perceive	the	world	or	to	think	,	and	that	's	 complete 	 ly 	 	wrong	.
if	you	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	question	for	any	length	of	time	,	it	's	 blind 	 ing 	 ly 	 	obvious	why	we	have	a	brain	.
we	have	a	brain	for	one	reason	and	one	reason	 on 	 ly 	 	,	and	that	's	to	produce	 adapt 	 able 	 	and	complex	 move 	 ments 	 	.
there	is	no	other	reason	to	have	a	brain	.
think	about	it	.
 move 	 ment 	 	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	you	have	of	 affect 	 ing 	 	the	world	around	you	.
now	that	's	not	 quit 	 e 	 	true	.	there	's	one	other	way	,	and	that	's	through	 sweat 	 ing 	 	.
but	 a 	 part 	 	from	that	,	 every 	 thing 	 	else	 go 	 es 	 	through	 contract 	 ions 	 	of	 muscle 	 s 	 	.
so	think	about	communication	--	speech	,	 gest 	 ures 	 	,	writing	,	sign	language	--	they	're	all	 mediate 	 d 	 	through	 contract 	 ions 	 	of	your	 muscle 	 s 	 	.
so	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	remember	that	 sensor 	 y 	 	,	 memor 	 y 	 	and	cognitive	 process 	 es 	 	are	all	 import 	 ant 	 	,	but	they	're	 on 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	either	drive	or	suppress	future	 move 	 ments 	 	.
there	can	be	no	 evolution 	 ary 	 	advantage	to	 lay 	 ing 	 	down	 memor 	 ies 	 	of	 child 	 hood 	 	or	 per 	 ceiv 	 ing 	 	the	color	of	a	rose	if	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	affect	the	way	you	're	going	to	move	 lat 	 er 	 	in	life	.
now	for	 t 	 hose 	 	who	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	argument	,	we	have	 tree 	 s 	 	and	grass	on	our	planet	 with 	 out 	 	the	brain	,	but	the	 cl 	 inch 	 ing 	 	evidence	is	 th 	 is 	 	animal	here	--	the	humble	sea	squirt	.
 rud 	 imentary 	 	animal	,	 ha 	 s 	 	a	nervous	system	,	 swim 	 s 	 	around	in	the	ocean	in	 it 	 s 	 	juvenile	life	.
and	at	some	point	of	 it 	 s 	 	life	,	it	 implant 	 s 	 	on	a	rock	.
and	the	first	thing	it	 do 	 es 	 	in	 implant 	 ing 	 	on	that	rock	,	which	it	never	 leav 	 es 	 	,	is	to	digest	 it 	 s 	 	own	brain	and	nervous	system	for	food	.
so	once	you	do	n't	need	to	move	,	you	do	n't	need	the	 luxur 	 y 	 	of	that	brain	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	animal	is	often	taken	 a 	 s 	 	an	 analog 	 y 	 	to	what	 happen 	 s 	 	at	 un 	 ive 	 rs 	 ities 	 	when	 professor 	 s 	 	get	 ten 	 ure 	 	,	but	that	's	a	different	subject	.
so	i	am	a	 move 	 ment 	 	chauvinist	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	is	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	function	of	the	brain	--	do	n't	let	 any 	 one 	 	tell	you	that	it	's	not	true	.
now	if	 move 	 ment 	 	is	so	 import 	 ant 	 	,	how	well	are	we	 do 	 ing 	 	 understand 	 ing 	 	how	the	brain	 control 	 s 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	?
and	the	answer	is	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 poor 	 ly 	 	;	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	problem	.
but	we	can	look	at	how	well	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	by	 think 	 ing 	 	about	how	well	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	building	 machine 	 s 	 	which	can	do	what	 human 	 s 	 	can	do	.
think	about	the	game	of	 ches 	 s 	 	.
how	well	are	we	 do 	 ing 	 	 determi 	 ning 	 	what	piece	to	move	where	?
if	you	pit	gary	kasparov	here	,	when	he	's	not	in	jail	,	against	ibm	's	deep	blue	,	well	the	answer	is	ibm	's	deep	blue	will	 occasion 	 ally 	 	win	.
and	i	think	if	ibm	's	deep	blue	 play 	 ed 	 	 any 	 one 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	it	would	win	every	time	.
that	problem	is	 solve 	 d 	 	.
what	about	the	problem	of	 pick 	 ing 	 	up	a	 ches 	 s 	 	piece	,	 dexter 	 ously 	 	 manipul 	 ating 	 	it	and	 put 	 ting 	 	it	back	down	on	the	board	?
if	you	put	a	five	year	-	old	child	's	 dexter 	 ity 	 	against	the	best	 robot 	 s 	 	of	 to 	 day 	 	,	the	answer	is	simple	:	the	child	 win 	 s 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	.
there	's	no	 com 	 petition 	 	at	all	.
now	why	is	that	top	problem	so	easy	and	the	bottom	problem	so	hard	?
one	reason	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	smart	five	year	-	old	could	tell	you	the	algorithm	for	that	top	problem	--	look	at	all	possible	 move 	 s 	 	to	the	end	of	the	game	and	 choos 	 e 	 	the	one	that	 make 	 s 	 	you	win	.
so	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	algorithm	.
now	of	course	there	are	other	 move 	 s 	 	,	but	with	vast	 computer 	 s 	 	we	approximate	and	come	close	to	the	optimal	solution	.
when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	 be 	 ing 	 	 dexter 	 ous 	 	,	it	's	not	even	clear	what	the	algorithm	is	you	have	to	solve	to	be	 dexter 	 ous 	 	.
and	we	'll	see	you	have	to	both	perceive	and	act	on	the	world	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	 problem 	 s 	 	.
but	let	me	show	you	cutting	-	edge	 robotic 	 s 	 	.
now	a	lot	of	 robotic 	 s 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 impress 	 ive 	 	,	but	 manipul 	 ation 	 	 robotic 	 s 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	just	in	the	dark	 age 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	end	of	a	ph.d.	project	from	one	of	the	best	 robotic 	 s 	 	 institute 	 s 	 	.
and	the	student	 ha 	 s 	 	trained	 th 	 is 	 	robot	to	pour	 th 	 is 	 	water	 in 	 to 	 	a	glass	.
it	's	a	hard	problem	 be 	 cause 	 	the	water	 s 	 lo 	 she 	 s 	 	about	,	but	it	can	do	it	.
but	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	do	it	with	 any 	 thing 	 	like	the	 ag 	 ility 	 	of	a	human	.
now	if	you	want	 th 	 is 	 	robot	to	do	a	different	task	,	that	's	 an 	 other 	 	three	-	year	ph.d.	program	.
there	is	no	 general 	 ization 	 	at	all	from	one	task	to	 an 	 other 	 	in	 robotic 	 s 	 	.
now	we	can	 compar 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	to	cutting	-	edge	human	performance	.
so	what	i	'm	going	to	show	you	is	emily	fox	winning	the	world	record	for	cup	 stack 	 ing 	 	.
now	the	americans	in	the	audience	will	know	all	about	cup	 stack 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	a	high	school	 s 	 port 	 	where	you	have	12	 cup 	 s 	 	you	have	to	stack	and	 un 	 stack 	 	against	the	clock	in	a	 pre 	 scribed 	 	order	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	her	 get 	 ting 	 	the	world	record	in	real	time	.
and	she	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	happy	.
we	have	no	idea	what	is	going	on	 in 	 side 	 	her	brain	when	she	 do 	 es 	 	that	,	and	that	's	what	we	'd	like	to	know	.
so	in	my	group	,	what	we	try	to	do	is	reverse	engineer	how	 human 	 s 	 	control	 move 	 ment 	 	.
and	it	 sound 	 s 	 	like	an	easy	problem	.
you	 s 	 end 	 	a	command	down	,	it	 cause 	 s 	 	 muscle 	 s 	 	to	contract	.
your	arm	or	body	 move 	 s 	 	,	and	you	get	 sensor 	 y 	 	 feed 	 back 	 	from	vision	,	from	skin	,	from	 muscle 	 s 	 	and	so	on	.
the	trouble	is	these	 signal 	 s 	 	are	not	the	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 signal 	 s 	 	you	want	them	to	be	.
so	one	thing	that	 make 	 s 	 	 controll 	 ing 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	difficult	is	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 sensor 	 y 	 	 feed 	 back 	 	is	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	noisy	.
now	by	noise	,	i	do	not	mean	sound	.
we	use	it	in	the	 engineer 	 ing 	 	and	 neuro 	 science 	 	sense	meaning	a	random	noise	 corrupt 	 ing 	 	a	signal	.
so	the	old	 day 	 s 	 	before	digital	radio	when	you	 we 	 re 	 	 t 	 un 	 ing 	 	in	your	radio	and	you	heard	``	crrcckkk	``	on	the	station	you	 want 	 ed 	 	to	hear	,	that	was	the	noise	.
but	more	 general 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	noise	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 corrupt 	 s 	 	the	signal	.
so	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	if	you	put	your	hand	under	a	table	and	try	to	 local 	 ize 	 	it	with	your	other	hand	,	you	can	be	off	by	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 centimeter 	 s 	 	due	to	the	noise	in	 sensor 	 y 	 	 feed 	 back 	 	.
 similar 	 ly 	 	,	when	you	put	motor	 out 	 put 	 	on	 move 	 ment 	 	 out 	 put 	 	,	it	's	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	noisy	.
forget	about	 try 	 ing 	 	to	hit	the	bull	's	eye	in	 d 	 art 	 s 	 	,	just	aim	for	the	same	spot	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	.
you	have	a	huge	spread	due	to	 move 	 ment 	 	 vari 	 ability 	 	.
and	more	than	that	,	the	 out 	 side 	 	world	,	or	task	,	is	both	 ambigu 	 ous 	 	and	 vari 	 able 	 	.
the	teapot	could	be	full	,	it	could	be	empty	.
it	 change 	 s 	 	over	time	.
so	we	work	in	a	whole	 sensor 	 y 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	task	soup	of	noise	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	noise	is	so	great	that	 socie 	 ty 	 	 place 	 s 	 	a	huge	 pre 	 mium 	 	on	 t 	 hose 	 	of	us	who	can	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	of	noise	.
so	if	you	're	 luck 	 y 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	to	be	able	to	knock	a	small	white	ball	 in 	 to 	 	a	hole	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	hundred	 yard 	 s 	 	away	using	a	long	metal	stick	,	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	will	be	 will 	 ing 	 	to	reward	you	with	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
now	what	i	want	to	 con 	 vince 	 	you	of	is	the	brain	 al 	 so 	 	 go 	 es 	 	through	a	lot	of	effort	to	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	negative	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	noise	and	 vari 	 ability 	 	.
and	to	do	that	,	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	about	a	 frame 	 work 	 	which	is	 ver 	 y 	 	popular	in	 statistic 	 s 	 	and	machine	 learn 	 ing 	 	of	the	last	50	 year 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	bayesian	decision	 theor 	 y 	 	.
and	it	's	more	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	a	 un 	 ifying 	 	way	to	think	about	how	the	brain	 deal 	 s 	 	with	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	.
and	the	fundamental	idea	is	you	want	to	make	 in 	 ference 	 s 	 	and	then	take	 action 	 s 	 	.
so	let	's	think	about	the	 in 	 ference 	 	.
you	want	to	generate	 belief 	 s 	 	about	the	world	.
so	what	are	 belief 	 s 	 	?
 belief 	 s 	 	could	be	:	where	are	my	 arm 	 s 	 	in	space	?
am	i	looking	at	a	cat	or	a	fox	?
but	we	're	going	to	represent	 belief 	 s 	 	with	 prob 	 abilities 	 	.
so	we	're	going	to	represent	a	belief	with	a	number	between	zero	and	one	--	zero	meaning	i	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	it	at	all	,	one	 mean 	 s 	 	i	'm	 absolute 	 ly 	 	certain	.
and	 number 	 s 	 	in	between	give	you	the	gray	 level 	 s 	 	of	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	.
and	the	key	idea	to	bayesian	 in 	 ference 	 	is	you	have	two	 source 	 s 	 	of	information	from	which	to	make	your	 in 	 ference 	 	.
you	have	data	,	and	data	in	 neuro 	 science 	 	is	 sensor 	 y 	 	 in 	 put 	 	.
so	i	have	 sensor 	 y 	 	 in 	 put 	 	,	which	i	can	take	in	to	make	 belief 	 s 	 	.
but	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	source	of	information	,	and	that	's	 effective 	 ly 	 	prior	knowledge	.
you	 accumul 	 ate 	 	knowledge	 through 	 out 	 	your	life	in	 memor 	 ies 	 	.
and	the	point	about	bayesian	decision	 theor 	 y 	 	is	it	 give 	 s 	 	you	the	 mathematic 	 s 	 	of	the	optimal	way	to	combine	your	prior	knowledge	with	your	 sensor 	 y 	 	evidence	to	generate	new	 belief 	 s 	 	.
and	i	've	put	the	formula	up	there	.
i	'm	not	going	to	explain	what	that	formula	is	,	but	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	real	 beaut 	 y 	 	and	real	 explan 	 atory 	 	power	.
and	what	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	and	what	you	want	to	estimate	,	is	the	 prob 	 ability 	 	of	different	 belief 	 s 	 	 give 	 n 	 	your	 sensor 	 y 	 	 in 	 put 	 	.
so	let	me	give	you	an	intuitive	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
imagine	you	're	 learn 	 ing 	 	to	play	tennis	and	you	want	to	decide	where	the	ball	is	going	to	 bounc 	 e 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	 come 	 s 	 	over	the	net	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	you	.
there	are	two	 source 	 s 	 	of	information	bayes	'	rule	 tell 	 s 	 	you	.
there	's	 sensor 	 y 	 	evidence	--	you	can	use	visual	information	 audit 	 ory 	 	information	,	and	that	might	tell	you	it	's	going	to	land	in	that	red	spot	.
but	you	know	that	your	 sense 	 s 	 	are	not	perfect	,	and	 there 	 fore 	 	there	's	some	 vari 	 ability 	 	of	where	it	's	going	to	land	 show 	 n 	 	by	that	cloud	of	red	,	 represent 	 ing 	 	 number 	 s 	 	between	0.5	and	 may 	 be 	 	0.1	.
that	information	is	 avail 	 able 	 	in	the	current	shot	,	but	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	source	of	information	not	 avail 	 able 	 	on	the	current	shot	,	but	 on 	 ly 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	by	 repeat 	 ed 	 	experience	in	the	game	of	tennis	,	and	that	's	that	the	ball	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 bounc 	 e 	 	with	equal	 prob 	 ability 	 	over	the	court	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	match	.
if	you	're	 play 	 ing 	 	against	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	opponent	,	they	may	 distribut 	 e 	 	it	in	that	green	area	,	which	is	the	prior	 distribut 	 ion 	 	,	making	it	hard	for	you	to	return	.
now	both	these	 source 	 s 	 	of	information	carry	 import 	 ant 	 	information	.
and	what	bayes	'	rule	 say 	 s 	 	is	that	i	should	 multi 	 ply 	 	the	 number 	 s 	 	on	the	red	by	the	 number 	 s 	 	on	the	green	to	get	the	 number 	 s 	 	of	the	yellow	,	which	have	the	 ellipse 	 s 	 	,	and	that	's	my	belief	.
so	it	's	the	optimal	way	of	 comb 	 in 	 ing 	 	information	.
now	i	would	n't	tell	you	all	 th 	 is 	 	if	it	was	n't	that	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	we	 show 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	people	do	when	they	learn	new	 move 	 ment 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	.
and	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	is	we	 re 	 ally 	 	are	bayesian	 in 	 ference 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	we	go	around	,	we	learn	about	 statistic 	 s 	 	of	the	world	and	lay	that	down	,	but	we	 al 	 so 	 	learn	about	how	noisy	our	own	 sensor 	 y 	 	apparatus	is	,	and	then	combine	 t 	 hose 	 	in	a	real	bayesian	way	.
now	a	key	part	to	the	bayesian	is	 th 	 is 	 	part	of	the	formula	.
and	what	 th 	 is 	 	part	 re 	 ally 	 	 say 	 s 	 	is	i	have	to	predict	the	 prob 	 ability 	 	of	different	 sensor 	 y 	 	 feed 	 back 	 s 	 	 give 	 n 	 	my	 belief 	 s 	 	.
so	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	i	have	to	make	 predict 	 ions 	 	of	the	future	.
and	i	want	to	 con 	 vince 	 	you	the	brain	 do 	 es 	 	make	 predict 	 ions 	 	of	the	 sensor 	 y 	 	 feed 	 back 	 	it	's	going	to	get	.
and	 more 	 over 	 	,	it	 pro 	 found 	 ly 	 	 change 	 s 	 	your	 per 	 ception 	 s 	 	by	what	you	do	.
and	to	do	that	,	i	'll	tell	you	about	how	the	brain	 deal 	 s 	 	with	 sensor 	 y 	 	 in 	 put 	 	.
so	you	 s 	 end 	 	a	command	out	,	you	get	 sensor 	 y 	 	 feed 	 back 	 	back	,	and	that	 transform 	 ation 	 	is	 govern 	 ed 	 	by	the	physics	of	your	body	and	your	 sensor 	 y 	 	apparatus	.
but	you	can	imagine	looking	 in 	 side 	 	the	brain	.
and	here	's	 in 	 side 	 	the	brain	.
you	might	have	a	little	 predict 	 or 	 	,	a	neural	 simul 	 ator 	 	,	of	the	physics	of	your	body	and	your	 sense 	 s 	 	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	you	 s 	 end 	 	a	 move 	 ment 	 	command	down	,	you	tap	a	copy	of	that	off	and	run	it	 in 	 to 	 	your	neural	 simul 	 ator 	 	to	 anticip 	 ate 	 	the	 sensor 	 y 	 	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	of	your	 action 	 s 	 	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	i	shake	 th 	 is 	 	 k 	 etch 	 up 	 	bottle	,	i	get	some	true	 sensor 	 y 	 	 feed 	 back 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	function	of	time	in	the	bottom	row	.
and	if	i	've	got	a	good	 predict 	 or 	 	,	it	 predict 	 s 	 	the	same	thing	.
well	why	would	i	 both 	 er 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	that	?
i	'm	going	to	get	the	same	 feed 	 back 	 	 any 	 way 	 	.
well	there	's	good	 reason 	 s 	 	.
imagine	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	shake	the	 k 	 etch 	 up 	 	bottle	,	 some 	 one 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 kind 	 ly 	 	 come 	 s 	 	up	to	me	and	 tap 	 s 	 	it	on	the	back	for	me	.
now	i	get	an	extra	source	of	 sensor 	 y 	 	information	due	to	that	external	act	.	so	i	get	two	 source 	 s 	 	.
i	get	you	 tap 	 ping 	 	on	it	,	and	i	get	me	 sha 	 king 	 	it	,	but	from	my	 sense 	 s 	 	'	point	of	view	,	that	is	 combine 	 d 	 	together	 in 	 to 	 	one	source	of	information	.
now	there	's	good	reason	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	you	would	want	to	be	able	to	distinguish	external	 event 	 s 	 	from	internal	 event 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	external	 event 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	much	more	 behavior 	 ally 	 	relevant	than	 feel 	 ing 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	that	's	going	on	 in 	 side 	 	my	body	.
so	one	way	to	 re 	 construct 	 	that	is	to	 compar 	 e 	 	the	 predict 	 ion 	 	--	which	is	 on 	 ly 	 	based	on	your	 move 	 ment 	 	 command 	 s 	 	--	with	the	 re 	 ality 	 	.
any	 discrep 	 ancy 	 	should	 hope 	 fully 	 	be	external	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	i	go	around	the	world	,	i	'm	making	 predict 	 ions 	 	of	what	i	should	get	,	 subtract 	 ing 	 	them	off	.
 every 	 thing 	 	left	over	is	external	to	me	.
what	evidence	is	there	for	 th 	 is 	 	?
well	there	's	one	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	 ex 	 ample 	 	where	a	 sens 	 ation 	 	generated	by	 my 	 self 	 	 feel 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	different	then	if	generated	by	 an 	 other 	 	person	.
and	so	we	 decide 	 d 	 	the	most	obvious	place	to	start	was	with	 tick 	 ling 	 	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	known	for	a	long	time	,	you	ca	n't	tickle	 your 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	other	people	can	.
but	it	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 show 	 n 	 	,	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	you	have	a	neural	 simul 	 ator 	 	,	 simul 	 ating 	 	your	own	body	and	 subtract 	 ing 	 	off	that	sense	.
so	we	can	 br 	 ing 	 	the	 experiment 	 s 	 	of	the	21st	century	by	 app 	 ly 	 ing 	 	robotic	 techno 	 logies 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	problem	.
and	in	effect	,	what	we	have	is	some	sort	of	stick	in	one	hand	 attach 	 ed 	 	to	a	robot	,	and	they	're	going	to	move	that	back	and	forward	.
and	then	we	're	going	to	track	that	with	a	computer	and	use	it	to	control	 an 	 other 	 	robot	,	which	is	going	to	tickle	 the 	 ir 	 	palm	with	 an 	 other 	 	stick	.
and	then	we	're	going	to	ask	them	to	rate	a	bunch	of	 thing 	 s 	 	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 ticklish 	 ness 	 	.
i	'll	show	you	just	one	part	of	our	 stud 	 y 	 	.
and	here	i	've	taken	away	the	 robot 	 s 	 	,	but	 bas 	 ically 	 	people	move	with	 the 	 ir 	 	right	arm	 sinusoidal 	 ly 	 	back	and	forward	.
and	we	 re 	 play 	 	that	to	the	other	hand	with	a	time	delay	.
either	no	time	delay	,	in	which	case	light	would	just	tickle	your	palm	,	or	with	a	time	delay	of	two	-	 tenth 	 s 	 	of	three	-	 tenth 	 s 	 	of	a	second	.
so	the	 import 	 ant 	 	point	here	is	the	right	hand	 al 	 ways 	 	 do 	 es 	 	the	same	 thing 	 s 	 	--	sinusoidal	 move 	 ment 	 	.
the	left	hand	 al 	 ways 	 	is	the	same	and	 put 	 s 	 	sinusoidal	tickle	.
all	we	're	 play 	 ing 	 	with	is	a	tempo	 caus 	 ality 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	we	go	from	naught	to	0.1	second	,	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	more	ticklish	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	go	from	0.1	to	0.2	,	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	more	ticklish	at	the	end	.
and	by	0.2	of	a	second	,	it	's	 equi 	 valent 	 ly 	 	ticklish	to	the	robot	that	just	 tickle 	 d 	 	you	 with 	 out 	 	you	 do 	 ing 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	.
so	 what 	 ever 	 	is	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	 can 	 cell 	 ation 	 	is	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 tight 	 ly 	 	 couple 	 d 	 	with	tempo	 caus 	 ality 	 	.
and	based	on	 th 	 is 	 	 illustr 	 ation 	 	,	we	 re 	 ally 	 	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	the	field	that	the	brain	's	making	precise	 predict 	 ions 	 	and	 subtract 	 ing 	 	them	off	from	the	 sens 	 ations 	 	.
now	i	have	to	admit	,	these	are	the	worst	 stud 	 ies 	 	my	lab	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	run	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	tickle	 sens 	 ation 	 	on	the	palm	 come 	 s 	 	and	 go 	 es 	 	,	you	need	large	 number 	 s 	 	of	 subject 	 s 	 	with	these	 star 	 s 	 	making	them	significant	.
so	we	 we 	 re 	 	looking	for	a	much	more	 object 	 ive 	 	way	to	assess	 th 	 is 	 	 phenomen 	 a 	 	.
and	in	the	 inter 	 ve 	 ning 	 	 year 	 s 	 	i	had	two	 daughter 	 s 	 	.
and	one	thing	you	notice	about	children	in	 back 	 seat 	 s 	 	of	 car 	 s 	 	on	long	 journey 	 s 	 	,	they	get	 in 	 to 	 	 fight 	 s 	 	--	which	 start 	 ed 	 	with	one	of	them	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	to	the	other	,	the	other	 retali 	 ating 	 	.
it	 quick 	 ly 	 	 escal 	 ates 	 	.
and	children	tend	to	get	 in 	 to 	 	 fight 	 s 	 	which	 escal 	 ate 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	force	.
now	when	i	 s 	 cream 	 ed 	 	at	my	children	to	stop	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	they	would	both	say	to	me	the	other	person	hit	them	 hard 	 er 	 	.
now	i	happen	to	know	my	children	do	n't	lie	,	so	i	thought	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 neuro 	 scientist 	 	,	it	was	 import 	 ant 	 	how	i	could	explain	how	they	 we 	 re 	 	 tell 	 ing 	 	 in 	 consist 	 ent 	 	 truth 	 s 	 	.
and	we	hypothesize	based	on	the	 tick 	 ling 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	that	when	one	child	 hit 	 s 	 	 an 	 other 	 	,	they	generate	the	 move 	 ment 	 	command	.
they	predict	the	 sensor 	 y 	 	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	and	subtract	it	off	.
so	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	think	they	've	hit	the	person	less	hard	than	they	have	--	 ra 	 ther 	 	like	the	 tick 	 ling 	 	.
 where 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 pass 	 ive 	 	recipient	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	the	 predict 	 ion 	 	,	 feel 	 s 	 	the	full	blow	.
so	if	they	 retali 	 ate 	 	with	the	same	force	,	the	first	person	will	think	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 escal 	 ated 	 	.
so	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	test	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	lab	.
now	we	do	n't	work	with	children	,	we	do	n't	work	with	hitting	,	but	the	 con 	 cept 	 	is	 ident 	 ical 	 	.
we	 br 	 ing 	 	in	two	 adult 	 s 	 	.	we	tell	them	they	're	going	to	play	a	game	.
and	so	here	's	player	one	and	player	two	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	 oppos 	 ite 	 	to	each	other	.
and	the	game	is	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	.
we	 start 	 ed 	 	with	a	motor	with	a	little	lever	,	a	little	force	 trans 	 fuse 	 r 	 	.
and	we	use	 th 	 is 	 	motor	to	 app 	 ly 	 	force	down	to	player	one	's	 finger 	 s 	 	for	three	 second 	 s 	 	and	then	it	 stop 	 s 	 	.
and	that	player	's	 be 	 en 	 	told	,	remember	the	experience	of	that	force	and	use	your	other	finger	to	 app 	 ly 	 	the	same	force	down	to	the	other	subject	's	finger	through	a	force	 trans 	 fuse 	 r 	 	--	and	they	do	that	.
and	player	two	's	 be 	 en 	 	told	,	remember	the	experience	of	that	force	.	use	your	other	hand	to	 app 	 ly 	 	the	force	back	down	.
and	so	they	take	it	in	 turn 	 s 	 	to	 app 	 ly 	 	the	force	they	've	just	 experience 	 d 	 	back	and	forward	.
but	 critical 	 ly 	 	,	they	're	 brief 	 ed 	 	about	the	 rule 	 s 	 	of	the	game	in	 separat 	 e 	 	rooms	.
so	they	do	n't	know	the	 rule 	 s 	 	the	other	person	's	 play 	 ing 	 	by	.
and	what	we	've	 measur 	 ed 	 	is	the	force	 a 	 s 	 	a	function	of	 term 	 s 	 	.
and	if	we	look	at	what	we	start	with	,	a	quarter	of	a	newton	there	,	a	number	of	 turn 	 s 	 	,	perfect	would	be	that	red	line	.
and	what	we	see	in	all	 pair 	 s 	 	of	 subject 	 s 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	--	a	70	percent	 escal 	 ation 	 	in	force	on	each	go	.
so	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 suggest 	 s 	 	,	when	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	--	based	on	 th 	 is 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	and	 other 	 s 	 	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	--	that	the	brain	is	 cancel 	 ing 	 	the	 sensor 	 y 	 	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	and	 under 	 estimating 	 	the	force	it	's	producing	.
so	it	re	-	 show 	 s 	 	the	brain	 make 	 s 	 	 predict 	 ions 	 	and	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	 change 	 s 	 	the	 pre 	 cept 	 s 	 	.
so	we	've	made	 in 	 ference 	 s 	 	,	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	 predict 	 ions 	 	,	now	we	have	to	generate	 action 	 s 	 	.
and	what	bayes	'	rule	 say 	 s 	 	is	,	 give 	 n 	 	my	 belief 	 s 	 	,	the	action	should	in	some	sense	be	optimal	.
but	we	've	got	a	problem	.
 task 	 s 	 	are	 symbol 	 ic 	 	--	i	want	to	drink	,	i	want	to	dance	--	but	the	 move 	 ment 	 	system	 ha 	 s 	 	to	contract	600	 muscle 	 s 	 	in	a	 part 	 icular 	 	sequence	.
and	there	's	a	big	gap	between	the	task	and	the	 move 	 ment 	 	system	.
so	it	could	be	 bridge 	 d 	 	in	 infinite 	 ly 	 	 man 	 y 	 	different	ways	.
so	think	about	just	a	point	to	point	 move 	 ment 	 	.
i	could	 choos 	 e 	 	these	two	 path 	 s 	 	out	of	an	infinite	number	of	 path 	 s 	 	.
 hav 	 ing 	 	 chose 	 n 	 	a	 part 	 icular 	 	path	,	i	can	hold	my	hand	on	that	path	 a 	 s 	 	 infinite 	 ly 	 	 man 	 y 	 	different	joint	 configu 	 ration 	 s 	 	.
and	i	can	hold	my	arm	in	a	 part 	 icular 	 	joint	 configu 	 ration 	 	either	 ver 	 y 	 	stiff	or	 ver 	 y 	 	 relax 	 ed 	 	.
so	i	have	a	huge	amount	of	choice	to	make	.
now	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	we	are	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 stereo 	 typical 	 	.
we	all	move	the	same	way	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	.
and	so	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	we	're	so	 stereo 	 typical 	 	,	our	 brain 	 s 	 	have	got	 dedicate 	 d 	 	neural	 circuit 	 ry 	 	to	decode	 th 	 is 	 	 stereo 	 ty 	 ping 	 	.
so	if	i	take	some	 dot 	 s 	 	and	set	them	in	motion	with	 bio 	 logical 	 	motion	,	your	brain	's	 circuit 	 ry 	 	would	understand	 instant 	 ly 	 	what	's	going	on	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	bunch	of	 dot 	 s 	 	moving	.
you	will	know	what	 th 	 is 	 	person	is	 do 	 ing 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	happy	,	 s 	 ad 	 	,	old	,	young	--	a	huge	amount	of	information	.
if	these	 dot 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 car 	 s 	 	going	on	a	 rac 	 ing 	 	circuit	,	you	would	have	 absolute 	 ly 	 	no	idea	what	's	going	on	.
so	why	is	it	that	we	move	the	 part 	 icular 	 	ways	we	do	?
well	let	's	think	about	what	 re 	 ally 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	we	do	n't	all	 quit 	 e 	 	move	the	same	way	.
 may 	 be 	 	there	's	 vari 	 ation 	 	in	the	population	.
and	 may 	 be 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	who	move	better	than	 other 	 s 	 	have	got	more	chance	of	 get 	 ting 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	children	 in 	 to 	 	the	next	generation	.
so	in	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 scale 	 s 	 	,	 move 	 ments 	 	get	better	.
and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	in	life	,	 move 	 ments 	 	get	better	through	 learn 	 ing 	 	.
so	what	is	it	about	a	 move 	 ment 	 	which	is	good	or	bad	?
imagine	i	want	to	 inter 	 cept 	 	 th 	 is 	 	ball	.
here	are	two	possible	 path 	 s 	 	to	that	ball	.
well	if	i	 choos 	 e 	 	the	left	-	hand	path	,	i	can	work	out	the	 force 	 s 	 	 requir 	 ed 	 	in	one	of	my	 muscle 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	function	of	time	.
but	there	's	noise	 add 	 ed 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	what	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	,	based	on	 th 	 is 	 	 love 	 ly 	 	,	smooth	,	 desir 	 ed 	 	force	,	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	noisy	version	.
so	if	i	pick	the	same	command	through	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	,	i	will	get	a	different	noisy	version	each	time	,	 be 	 cause 	 	noise	 change 	 s 	 	each	time	.
so	what	i	can	show	you	here	is	how	the	 vari 	 ability 	 	of	the	 move 	 ment 	 	will	evolve	if	i	 choos 	 e 	 	that	way	.
if	i	 choos 	 e 	 	a	different	way	of	moving	--	on	the	right	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	--	then	i	'll	have	a	different	command	,	different	noise	,	 play 	 ing 	 	through	a	noisy	system	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	.
all	we	can	be	 s 	 ure 	 	of	is	the	 vari 	 ability 	 	will	be	different	.
if	i	move	in	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	way	,	i	end	up	with	a	 small 	 er 	 	 vari 	 ability 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 move 	 ments 	 	.
so	if	i	have	to	 choos 	 e 	 	between	 t 	 hose 	 	two	,	i	would	 choos 	 e 	 	the	right	one	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	less	 vari 	 able 	 	.
and	the	fundamental	idea	is	you	want	to	plan	your	 move 	 ments 	 	so	 a 	 s 	 	to	 minim 	 ize 	 	the	negative	 con 	 sequence 	 	of	the	noise	.
and	one	 intuit 	 ion 	 	to	get	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	amount	of	noise	or	 vari 	 ability 	 	i	show	here	 get 	 s 	 	 big 	 ger 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	force	 get 	 s 	 	 big 	 ger 	 	.
so	you	want	to	avoid	big	 force 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	one	principle	.
so	we	've	 show 	 n 	 	that	using	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	can	explain	a	huge	amount	of	data	--	that	 exact 	 ly 	 	people	are	going	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	 plan 	 ning 	 	 move 	 ments 	 	so	 a 	 s 	 	to	 minim 	 ize 	 	negative	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	of	noise	.
so	i	hope	i	've	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	you	the	brain	is	there	and	 evolv 	 ed 	 	to	control	 move 	 ment 	 	.
and	it	's	an	intellectual	 challeng 	 e 	 	to	understand	how	we	do	that	.
but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	relevant	for	disease	and	 rehabilit 	 ation 	 	.
there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	which	effect	 move 	 ment 	 	.
and	 hope 	 fully 	 	if	we	understand	how	we	control	 move 	 ment 	 	,	we	can	 app 	 ly 	 	that	to	robotic	technology	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	i	want	to	 re 	 mind 	 	you	,	when	you	see	 animal 	 s 	 	do	what	look	like	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 task 	 s 	 	,	the	actual	 complex 	 ity 	 	of	what	is	going	on	 in 	 side 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	brain	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 dramat 	 ic 	 	.

chris	anderson	:	quick	question	for	you	,	dan	.
so	you	're	a	 move 	 ment 	 	--	--	chauvinist	.
 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	that	you	think	that	the	other	 thing 	 s 	 	we	think	our	 brain 	 s 	 	are	about	--	the	 dream 	 ing 	 	,	the	 year 	 ning 	 	,	the	 fall 	 ing 	 	in	love	and	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	--	are	a	kind	of	side	show	,	an	accident	?
dw	:	no	,	no	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	i	think	they	're	all	 import 	 ant 	 	to	drive	the	right	 move 	 ment 	 	behavior	to	get	 re 	 production 	 	in	the	end	.

the	fact	that	we	forget	most	of	our	 child 	 hood 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	fine	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	effect	our	 move 	 ments 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	in	life	.
you	 on 	 ly 	 	need	to	store	 thing 	 s 	 	which	are	 re 	 ally 	 	going	to	effect	 move 	 ment 	 	.
