in	1962	,	charles	van	doren	,	who	was	 lat 	 er 	 	a	senior	editor	of	britannica	,	 s 	 aid 	 	the	ideal	encyclopedia	should	be	radical	--	it	should	stop	 be 	 ing 	 	safe	.
but	if	you	know	 any 	 thing 	 	about	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	britannica	since	1962	,	it	was	 any 	 thing 	 	but	radical	:	still	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	safe	,	stodgy	type	of	encyclopedia	.
 wiki 	 pedia 	 	,	on	the	other	hand	,	 begin 	 s 	 	with	a	 ver 	 y 	 	radical	idea	,	and	that	's	for	all	of	us	to	imagine	a	world	in	which	every	single	person	on	the	planet	is	 give 	 n 	 	free	access	to	the	sum	of	all	human	knowledge	.
and	that	's	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	.	so	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	--	you	just	saw	the	little	 demonst 	 ration 	 	of	it	--	it	's	a	 free 	 ly 	 	 licens 	 ed 	 	encyclopedia	.	it	's	written	by	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 volunteer 	 s 	 	all	over	the	world	in	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 language 	 s 	 	.
it	's	written	using	wiki	 soft 	 ware 	 	--	which	is	the	type	of	 soft 	 ware 	 	he	just	 demonst 	 rated 	 	--	so	 any 	 one 	 	can	 quick 	 ly 	 	edit	and	 s 	 ave 	 	,	and	it	 go 	 es 	 	live	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	.
and	 every 	 thing 	 	about	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	is	 manage 	 d 	 	by	 virtual 	 ly 	 	an	all	-	volunteer	staff	.
so	when	yochai	is	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	new	 method 	 s 	 	of	 organ 	 ization 	 	,	he	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	 de 	 s 	 crib 	 ing 	 	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	.	and	what	i	'm	going	to	do	 to 	 day 	 	is	tell	you	a	little	bit	more	about	how	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 work 	 s 	 	on	the	 in 	 side 	 	.
so	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	's	owned	by	the	wikimedia	 found 	 ation 	 	,	which	i	 found 	 ed 	 	,	a	 non 	 profit 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	.	and	our	goal	,	the	core	aim	of	the	wikimedia	 found 	 ation 	 	,	is	to	get	a	free	encyclopedia	to	every	single	person	on	the	planet	.
and	so	if	you	think	about	what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	,	it	 mean 	 s 	 	a	lot	more	than	just	building	a	cool	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	all	the	 issue 	 s 	 	of	the	digital	divide	,	poverty	 world 	 wide 	 	,	 empower 	 ing 	 	people	 every 	 where 	 	to	have	the	information	that	they	need	to	make	good	 decision 	 s 	 	.
and	so	we	're	going	to	have	to	do	a	lot	of	work	that	 go 	 es 	 	beyond	just	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
and	so	that	's	a	big	part	of	why	we	've	 chose 	 n 	 	the	free	 licens 	 ing 	 	model	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	 empower 	 s 	 	local	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	--	or	 any 	 one 	 	who	 want 	 s 	 	to	,	can	take	our	content	and	do	 any 	 thing 	 	they	like	with	it	--	you	can	copy	it	,	 re 	 distribut 	 e 	 	it	and	you	can	do	it	 commercial 	 ly 	 	or	non	-	 commercial 	 ly 	 	.
so	there	's	a	lot	of	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	that	are	going	to	arise	around	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	all	over	the	world	.
we	're	funded	by	 don 	 ations 	 	from	the	public	,	and	one	of	the	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	about	that	is	how	little	money	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 take 	 s 	 	to	run	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	.
so	yochai	 show 	 ed 	 	you	the	graph	of	what	the	cost	of	a	 print 	 ing 	 	press	was	.
and	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	what	the	cost	of	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	is	,	but	first	i	'll	show	you	how	big	it	is	.
so	we	've	got	over	600,000	 article 	 s 	 	in	english	.
we	've	got	two	million	total	 article 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	different	 language 	 s 	 	.
the	 big 	 gest 	 	 language 	 s 	 	are	german	,	japanese	,	french	--
all	the	western	european	 language 	 s 	 	are	 quit 	 e 	 	big	.
but	 on 	 ly 	 	around	one	-	third	of	all	of	our	traffic	to	our	web	 cluster 	 s 	 	to	the	english	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	,	which	is	surprising	to	a	lot	of	people	.
a	lot	of	people	think	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	english	-	centric	way	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	but	for	us	,	we	're	 tru 	 ly 	 	global	.	we	're	in	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 language 	 s 	 	.
how	popular	we	've	gotten	to	be	--	we	're	a	top	50	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	and	we	're	more	popular	than	the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	we	get	to	yochai	's	 discuss 	 ion 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 show 	 s 	 	the	growth	of	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	--	we	're	the	blue	line	there	--	and	then	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	over	there	.
and	what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	is	a	huge	,	enormous	corporate	operation	with	--	i	have	no	idea	how	 man 	 y 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 employ 	 ees 	 	.
we	have	 exact 	 ly 	 	one	 employ 	 ee 	 	,	and	that	 employ 	 ee 	 	is	our	lead	 soft 	 ware 	 	 develop 	 er 	 	.
and	he	's	 on 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	our	 employ 	 ee 	 	since	january	2005	,	all	the	other	growth	before	that	.
so	the	 serv 	 ers 	 	are	 manage 	 d 	 	by	a	rag	-	tag	band	of	 volunteer 	 s 	 	;	all	the	 edit 	 ing 	 	is	 d 	 one 	 	by	 volunteer 	 s 	 	.
and	the	way	that	we	're	 organize 	 d 	 	is	not	like	any	 tradition 	 al 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	you	can	imagine	.
people	are	 al 	 ways 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	,	``	well	,	who	's	in	charge	of	 th 	 is 	 	?	``
or	``	who	 do 	 es 	 	that	?	``	and	the	answer	is	:	 any 	 body 	 	who	 want 	 s 	 	to	pitch	in	.
it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 usual 	 	and	chaotic	thing	.
we	've	got	over	90	 serv 	 ers 	 	now	in	three	 location 	 s 	 	.
these	are	 manage 	 d 	 	by	volunteer	system	 administr 	 ators 	 	who	are	 on 	 line 	 	.
i	can	go	 on 	 line 	 	any	time	of	the	day	or	night	and	see	eight	to	10	people	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	me	to	ask	a	question	or	 some 	 thing 	 	,	 any 	 thing 	 	about	the	 serv 	 ers 	 	.
you	could	never	afford	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	in	a	company	.
you	could	never	afford	to	have	a	 stand 	 by 	 	crew	of	people	24	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	and	do	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	at	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	.
so	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	around	1.4	billion	page	 view 	 s 	 	 month 	 ly 	 	,	so	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	gotten	to	be	a	huge	thing	.
and	 every 	 thing 	 	is	 manage 	 d 	 	by	the	 volunteer 	 s 	 	.
and	the	total	 month 	 ly 	 	cost	for	our	 band 	 width 	 	is	about	5,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	 essential 	 ly 	 	our	main	cost	.
we	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	 with 	 out 	 	the	 employ 	 ee 	 	.	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	we	 hire 	 d 	 	brian	 be 	 cause 	 	he	was	 work 	 ing 	 	part	-	time	for	two	 year 	 s 	 	and	full	-	time	at	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	,	so	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 hire 	 d 	 	him	so	he	could	get	a	life	and	go	to	the	 movie 	 s 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	.
so	the	big	question	when	you	've	got	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	chaotic	 organ 	 ization 	 	is	,	why	is	n't	it	all	 rub 	 b 	 ish 	 	?	why	is	the	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	 a 	 s 	 	good	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	?
first	of	all	,	how	good	is	it	?	well	,	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	.	it	is	n't	perfect	,	but	it	's	much	,	much	better	than	you	would	expect	,	 give 	 n 	 	our	 complete 	 ly 	 	chaotic	model	.
so	when	you	saw	him	make	a	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	edit	to	the	page	about	me	,	you	think	,	oh	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 obvious 	 ly 	 	just	going	to	 de 	 generate 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 rub 	 b 	 ish 	 	.	but	when	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	quality	 test 	 s 	 	--	and	there	have	n't	 be 	 en 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	of	these	yet	and	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 encourag 	 ing 	 	people	to	do	more	,	 compar 	 ing 	 	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	to	 tradition 	 al 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	--	we	win	 hand 	 s 	 	down	.
so	a	german	magazine	 compar 	 ed 	 	german	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	,	which	is	 re 	 ally 	 	much	,	much	 small 	 er 	 	than	english	,	to	 micro 	 soft 	 	encarta	and	to	brockhaus	 multi 	 media 	 	,	and	we	won	 a 	 cross 	 	the	board	.
they	 hire 	 d 	 	 expert 	 s 	 	to	come	and	look	at	 article 	 s 	 	and	 compar 	 e 	 	the	quality	,	and	we	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 pleas 	 ed 	 	with	that	result	.
so	a	lot	of	people	have	heard	about	the	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	bush	-	kerry	 contr 	 over 	 s 	 y 	 	.
the	media	 ha 	 s 	 	 cover 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 some 	 what 	 	 extens 	 ively 	 	.
it	 start 	 ed 	 	out	with	an	article	in	red	 her 	 ring 	 	.
the	 report 	 ers 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	me	up	and	they	--	i	mean	,	i	have	to	say	they	 spell 	 ed 	 	my	name	right	,	but	they	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	say	,	the	bush	-	kerry	election	is	so	 content 	 ious 	 	,	it	's	 tear 	 ing 	 	 a 	 part 	 	the	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	community	.	and	so	they	quote	me	 a 	 s 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	they	're	the	most	 content 	 ious 	 	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	.	``
what	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	is	,	they	're	not	 content 	 ious 	 	at	all	.
so	it	's	a	 s 	 light 	 	 mis 	 quote 	 	.	the	 article 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 edit 	 ed 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 heav 	 ily 	 	.
and	it	is	true	that	we	did	have	to	lock	the	 article 	 s 	 	on	a	couple	of	 occasion 	 s 	 	.
time	magazine	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 report 	 ed 	 	that	``	 extrem 	 e 	 	action	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	taken	,	and	wales	 lock 	 ed 	 	the	 ent 	 ries 	 	on	kerry	and	bush	for	most	of	2004	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	came	after	i	told	the	 report 	 er 	 	that	we	had	to	lock	it	for	--	 occasion 	 ally 	 	a	little	bit	here	and	there	.
so	the	truth	in	general	is	that	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 contr 	 over 	 s 	 ies 	 	that	you	would	 prob 	 ably 	 	think	we	have	 with 	 in 	 	the	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	community	are	not	 re 	 ally 	 	 contr 	 over 	 s 	 ies 	 	at	all	.
 article 	 s 	 	on	controversial	 top 	 ic 	 s 	 	are	 edit 	 ed 	 	a	lot	,	but	they	do	n't	cause	much	 contr 	 over 	 s 	 y 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	community	.
and	the	reason	for	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	most	people	understand	the	need	for	 neutral 	 ity 	 	.
the	real	struggle	is	not	between	the	right	and	the	left	--	that	's	where	most	people	 assum 	 e 	 	--	but	it	's	between	the	party	of	the	 thought 	 ful 	 	and	the	party	of	the	 jerk 	 s 	 	.
and	no	side	of	the	 politic 	 al 	 	spectrum	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 monopol 	 y 	 	on	either	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 qual 	 ities 	 	.
the	actual	truth	about	the	specific	bush	-	kerry	incident	is	that	the	bush	-	kerry	 article 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 lock 	 ed 	 	less	than	one	percent	of	the	time	in	2004	,	and	it	was	n't	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 content 	 ious 	 	;	it	was	just	 be 	 cause 	 	there	was	routine	 van 	 d 	 al 	 ism 	 	--	which	 happen 	 s 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	even	on	stage	,	people	--	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	even	 report 	 ers 	 	have	 report 	 ed 	 	to	me	that	they	vandalize	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	and	 we 	 re 	 	 amaz 	 ed 	 	that	it	was	 fix 	 ed 	 	so	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	--	you	know	,	i	 al 	 ways 	 	say	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	do	n't	do	that	;	that	's	not	a	good	thing	.
so	how	do	we	do	 th 	 is 	 	?
how	do	we	manage	the	quality	control	?
how	 do 	 es 	 	it	work	?
so	there	's	a	few	 element 	 s 	 	,	 most 	 ly 	 	social	 poli 	 cies 	 	and	some	 element 	 s 	 	of	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	.
so	the	 big 	 gest 	 	and	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	is	our	neutral	point	-	of	-	view	policy	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	set	down	from	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	core	principle	of	the	community	that	's	 complete 	 ly 	 	not	 de 	 bat 	 able 	 	.
it	's	a	social	 con 	 cept 	 	of	 co 	 operation 	 	,	so	we	do	n't	talk	a	lot	about	truth	and	 object 	 ivity 	 	.
the	reason	for	 th 	 is 	 	is	if	we	say	we	're	 on 	 ly 	 	going	to	write	the	``	truth	``	about	some	 top 	 ic 	 	,	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	do	us	a	damn	bit	of	good	of	 figur 	 ing 	 	out	what	to	write	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	do	n't	agree	with	you	about	what	's	the	truth	.
but	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	 jar 	 gon 	 	term	of	 neutral 	 ity 	 	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	own	long	 histo 	 ry 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	community	,	which	 bas 	 ically 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	any	time	there	's	a	controversial	issue	,	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	 it 	 self 	 	should	not	take	a	stand	on	the	issue	.	we	should	 mere 	 ly 	 	report	on	what	 re 	 put 	 able 	 	 part 	 ies 	 	have	 s 	 aid 	 	about	it	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 neutral 	 ity 	 	policy	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	for	us	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 empower 	 s 	 	a	community	that	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 divers 	 e 	 	to	come	together	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	some	work	 d 	 one 	 	.
so	we	have	 ver 	 y 	 	 divers 	 e 	 	 contributor 	 s 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 politic 	 al 	 	,	religious	,	cultural	 back 	 ground 	 s 	 	.
by	 hav 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	firm	 neutral 	 ity 	 	policy	,	which	is	non	-	 negoti 	 able 	 	from	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	we	ensure	that	people	can	work	together	and	that	the	 ent 	 ries 	 	do	n't	 be 	 come 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	a	war	back	and	forth	between	the	left	and	the	right	.
if	you	engage	in	that	type	of	behavior	,	you	'll	be	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	 leav 	 e 	 	the	community	.
so	real	-	time	peer	review	.	every	single	change	on	the	 s 	 ite 	 	 go 	 es 	 	to	the	 re 	 cent 	 	 change 	 s 	 	page	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	he	made	his	change	,	it	went	to	the	 re 	 cent 	 	 change 	 s 	 	page	.
that	 re 	 cent 	 	 change 	 s 	 	page	was	 al 	 so 	 	fed	 in 	 to 	 	irc	channel	,	which	is	an	 inter 	 net 	 	chat	channel	that	people	are	 monitor 	 ing 	 	with	 vari 	 ous 	 	 soft 	 ware 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	.
and	people	can	get	rss	 feed 	 s 	 	--	they	can	get	 e 	 - 	 mail 	 	 not 	 ification 	 s 	 	of	 change 	 s 	 	.
and	then	 user 	 s 	 	can	set	up	 the 	 ir 	 	own	personal	watch	list	.
so	my	page	is	on	 quit 	 e 	 	a	few	 volunteer 	 s 	 	'	watch	 list 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 vandalize 	 d 	 	.
and	 there 	 fore 	 	,	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	 some 	 one 	 	will	notice	the	change	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	and	then	they	'll	just	 simpl 	 y 	 	 re 	 vert 	 	the	change	.
there	's	a	new	 page 	 s 	 	feed	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	so	you	can	go	to	a	certain	page	of	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	and	see	every	new	page	 a 	 s 	 	it	's	 create 	 d 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	a	lot	of	new	 page 	 s 	 	that	get	 create 	 d 	 	are	just	garbage	that	have	to	be	 delet 	 ed 	 	,	you	know	,	asdfasdf	.
but	 al 	 so 	 	that	's	some	of	the	most	 interest 	 ing 	 	and	 f 	 un 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	at	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	,	some	of	the	new	 article 	 s 	 	.
people	will	start	an	article	on	some	 interest 	 ing 	 	 top 	 ic 	 	,	other	people	will	find	that	 intrigu 	 ing 	 	and	jump	in	and	help	and	make	it	much	better	.
so	we	do	have	 edit 	 s 	 	by	 anonym 	 ous 	 	 user 	 s 	 	,	which	is	one	of	the	most	controversial	and	 intrigu 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	about	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	.
so	chris	was	able	to	do	his	change	--	he	did	n't	have	to	log	in	or	 any 	 thing 	 	;	he	just	went	on	the	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	and	made	a	change	.
but	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	 on 	 ly 	 	about	18	percent	of	all	the	 edit 	 s 	 	to	the	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	are	 d 	 one 	 	by	 anonym 	 ous 	 	 user 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	to	understand	,	is	that	the	vast	 major 	 ity 	 	of	the	 edit 	 s 	 	that	go	on	on	the	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	are	from	a	 ver 	 y 	 	close	-	knit	community	of	 may 	 be 	 	600	to	1,000	people	who	are	in	constant	communication	.
and	we	have	over	40	irc	 channel 	 s 	 	,	40	 mail 	 ing 	 	 list 	 s 	 	.
all	these	people	know	each	other	.	they	communicate	;	we	have	 off 	 line 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
these	are	the	people	who	are	 do 	 ing 	 	the	bulk	of	the	 s 	 ite 	 	,	and	they	are	,	in	a	sense	,	semi	-	 professional 	 s 	 	at	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	,	that	the	 standard 	 s 	 	we	set	for	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	are	equal	to	or	 high 	 er 	 	than	professional	 standard 	 s 	 	of	quality	.
we	do	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	meet	 t 	 hose 	 	 standard 	 s 	 	,	but	that	's	what	we	're	 striv 	 ing 	 	for	.
and	so	that	tight	community	is	who	 re 	 ally 	 	 care 	 s 	 	for	the	 s 	 ite 	 	,	and	these	are	some	of	the	 smart 	 est 	 	people	i	've	ever	met	.	of	course	,	it	's	my	job	to	say	that	,	but	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	true	.
the	type	of	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	drawn	to	writing	an	encyclopedia	for	 f 	 un 	 	tend	to	be	 pre 	 tty 	 	smart	people	.
the	 tool 	 s 	 	and	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	:	there	's	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 tool 	 s 	 	that	allow	us	--	allow	us	,	meaning	the	community	--	to	self	-	monitor	and	to	monitor	all	the	work	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	a	page	 histo 	 ry 	 	on	``	flat	earth	,	``	and	you	can	see	some	 change 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	made	.
what	's	nice	about	 th 	 is 	 	page	is	you	can	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	take	a	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	and	see	,	oh	ok	,	i	understand	now	.
when	 some 	 body 	 	 go 	 es 	 	and	 look 	 s 	 	at	--	they	see	that	 some 	 one 	 	,	an	 anonym 	 ous 	 	ip	number	,	made	an	edit	to	my	page	--	that	 sound 	 s 	 	suspicious	--	who	is	 th 	 is 	 	person	?	 some 	 body 	 	 look 	 s 	 	at	it	--	they	can	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	see	 high 	 light 	 ed 	 	in	red	all	of	the	 change 	 s 	 	that	took	place	,	to	see	,	ok	,	well	,	these	 word 	 s 	 	have	 change 	 d 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	that	's	one	tool	that	we	can	use	to	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	monitor	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	a	page	.
 an 	 other 	 	thing	that	we	do	 with 	 in 	 	the	community	is	we	 leav 	 e 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	open	-	 end 	 ed 	 	.
most	of	the	social	 rule 	 s 	 	and	the	 method 	 s 	 	of	work	are	left	 complete 	 ly 	 	open	-	 end 	 ed 	 	in	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	.
all	of	that	stuff	is	just	on	wiki	 page 	 s 	 	.
and	so	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	in	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	that	 enforce 	 s 	 	the	 rule 	 s 	 	.
the	 ex 	 ample 	 	i	've	got	up	here	is	a	 vote 	 s 	 	for	 delet 	 ion 	 	page	.
so	,	i	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	,	people	type	asdfasdf	--	it	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 delet 	 ed 	 	.	 case 	 s 	 	like	that	,	the	 administr 	 ators 	 	just	delete	it	.
there	's	no	reason	to	have	a	big	argument	about	it	.
but	you	can	imagine	there	's	a	lot	of	other	 area 	 s 	 	where	the	question	is	,	is	 th 	 is 	 	 not 	 able 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	to	go	in	an	encyclopedia	?
is	the	information	 ver 	 ifiable 	 	?	is	it	a	hoax	?	is	it	true	?	is	it	what	?
so	we	 need 	 ed 	 	a	social	method	for	 figur 	 ing 	 	out	the	answer	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	so	the	method	that	 a 	 rose 	 	 organ 	 ically 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	community	is	the	 vote 	 s 	 	for	 delet 	 ion 	 	page	.
and	in	the	 part 	 icular 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	we	have	here	,	it	's	a	film	,	``	 twist 	 ed 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	,	``	and	the	first	person	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	now	 th 	 is 	 	is	 suppose 	 d 	 ly 	 	a	film	.	it	 fail 	 s 	 	the	google	test	 mis 	 er 	 ably 	 	.	``
the	google	test	is	,	you	look	in	google	and	see	if	it	's	there	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	 some 	 thing 	 	's	not	even	in	google	,	it	 prob 	 ably 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	exist	at	all	.
it	's	not	a	perfect	rule	,	but	it	's	a	nice	 start 	 ing 	 	point	for	quick	research	.
so	 some 	 body 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	delete	it	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	.	delete	it	--	it	's	not	 not 	 able 	 	.	``
and	then	 some 	 body 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	wait	,	wait	,	wait	,	wait	,	i	found	it	.
i	found	it	in	a	book	,	'	film	threat	video	guide	:	the	20	 under 	 ground 	 	 film 	 s 	 	you	must	see	.	'	``
oh	,	ok	.	so	the	next	 person 	 s 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	clean	it	up	.	``	 some 	 body 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	've	found	it	on	imdb	.	keep	,	keep	,	keep	.	``
and	what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	is	--	these	 vote 	 s 	 	are	just	--	they	're	just	text	 type 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	page	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 re 	 ally 	 	a	vote	so	much	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	a	 dial 	 ogue 	 	.
now	it	is	true	that	at	the	end	of	the	day	an	 administr 	 ator 	 	can	go	through	here	and	take	a	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	and	say	,	ok	,	18	 delete 	 s 	 	,	two	 keep 	 s 	 	:	we	'll	delete	it	.
but	in	other	 case 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	could	be	18	 delete 	 s 	 	and	two	 keep 	 s 	 	,	and	we	would	keep	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	 t 	 hose 	 	last	two	 keep 	 s 	 	say	,	``	wait	a	minute	,	wait	a	minute	.
 no 	 body 	 	else	saw	 th 	 is 	 	but	i	found	it	in	a	book	,	and	i	found	a	link	to	a	page	that	 de 	 scribe 	 s 	 	it	,	and	i	'm	going	to	clean	it	up	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	,	so	 pleas 	 e 	 	do	n't	delete	it	,	``	then	it	would	 surviv 	 e 	 	.
and	it	 al 	 so 	 	 matter 	 s 	 	who	the	people	are	who	are	 vot 	 ing 	 	.
like	i	say	,	it	's	a	tight	knit	community	.
down	here	at	the	bottom	,	``	keep	,	real	movie	,	``	rick	kay	.
rick	kay	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	famous	wikipedian	who	 do 	 es 	 	an	enormous	amount	of	work	with	 van 	 d 	 al 	 ism 	 	,	 hoax 	 es 	 	and	 vote 	 s 	 	for	 delet 	 ion 	 	.
his	voice	 car 	 ries 	 	a	lot	of	weight	 with 	 in 	 	the	community	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 know 	 s 	 	what	he	's	 do 	 ing 	 	.
so	how	's	all	 th 	 is 	 	 govern 	 ed 	 	?
people	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	know	about	,	ok	,	 administr 	 ators 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	.
so	the	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	 govern 	 ance 	 	model	,	the	 govern 	 ance 	 	of	the	community	,	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 con 	 fusing 	 	,	but	a	 work 	 able 	 	mix	of	 con 	 sens 	 us 	 	--
meaning	we	try	not	to	vote	on	the	content	of	 article 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 major 	 ity 	 	view	is	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	neutral	.
some	amount	of	 demo 	 cracy 	 	,	all	of	the	 administr 	 ators 	 	--	these	are	the	people	who	have	the	ability	to	delete	 page 	 s 	 	,	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	that	they	have	the	right	to	delete	 page 	 s 	 	;	they	still	have	to	follow	all	the	 rule 	 s 	 	--	but	they	're	 elect 	 ed 	 	;	they	're	 elect 	 ed 	 	by	the	community	.	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	people	--	random	 troll 	 s 	 	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	--	like	to	 accus 	 e 	 	me	of	 hand 	 pick 	 ing 	 	the	 administr 	 ators 	 	to	bias	the	content	of	the	encyclopedia	.
i	 al 	 ways 	 	laugh	at	 th 	 is 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	have	no	idea	how	they	're	 elect 	 ed 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
there	's	a	certain	amount	of	 aristoc 	 racy 	 	.
and	so	you	've	got	a	hint	of	that	when	i	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	,	like	,	rick	kay	's	voice	would	carry	a	lot	more	weight	than	 some 	 one 	 	we	do	n't	know	.
i	give	 th 	 is 	 	talk	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	with	angela	,	who	was	just	re	-	 elect 	 ed 	 	to	the	board	from	the	community	--	to	the	board	of	the	 found 	 ation 	 	,	with	more	than	twice	the	 vote 	 s 	 	of	the	person	who	did	n't	make	it	.
and	i	 al 	 ways 	 	embarrass	her	 be 	 cause 	 	i	say	,	well	,	angela	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	could	get	away	with	 do 	 ing 	 	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	 with 	 in 	 	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	she	's	so	 admire 	 d 	 	and	so	 power 	 ful 	 	.
but	the	 iron 	 y 	 	is	,	of	course	,	that	angela	can	do	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	she	's	the	one	person	who	you	know	would	never	,	ever	,	ever	break	any	 rule 	 s 	 	of	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	.
and	i	 al 	 so 	 	like	to	say	she	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	person	who	 actual 	 ly 	 	 know 	 s 	 	all	the	 rule 	 s 	 	of	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	,	so	...
and	then	there	's	 mon 	 arch 	 y 	 	and	that	's	my	role	on	the	community	,	so	...
i	was	 de 	 s 	 crib 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	berlin	once	and	the	next	day	in	the	 news 	 paper 	 	the	 head 	 line 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	am	the	 que 	 en 	 	of	england	.	``
and	that	's	not	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	but	--	the	point	is	my	role	in	the	community	--	 with 	 in 	 	the	free	 soft 	 ware 	 	world	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	 long 	 stand 	 ing 	 	tradition	of	the	``	 benevol 	 ent 	 	dictator	``	model	.
so	if	you	look	at	most	of	the	major	free	 soft 	 ware 	 	 project 	 s 	 	,	they	have	one	single	person	in	charge	who	 every 	 one 	 	 agree 	 s 	 	is	the	 benevol 	 ent 	 	dictator	.
well	,	i	do	n't	like	the	term	``	 benevol 	 ent 	 	dictator	,	``	and	i	do	n't	think	that	it	's	my	job	or	my	role	in	the	world	of	 idea 	 s 	 	to	be	the	dictator	of	the	future	of	all	human	knowledge	 compil 	 ed 	 	by	the	world	.
it	just	is	n't	appropriate	.
but	there	is	a	need	still	for	a	certain	amount	of	 mon 	 arch 	 y 	 	,	a	certain	amount	of	--	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	we	have	to	make	a	decision	,	and	we	do	n't	want	to	get	 bog 	 ged 	 	down	too	 heav 	 ily 	 	in	 form 	 al 	 	decision	-	making	 process 	 es 	 	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	why	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	--	or	how	 th 	 is 	 	can	be	 import 	 ant 	 	:	we	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	had	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	where	a	neo	-	nazi	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	,	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	oh	,	well	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 horr 	 ible 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	jewish	 conspi 	 racy 	 	of	a	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	and	we	're	going	to	get	certain	 article 	 s 	 	 delet 	 ed 	 	that	we	do	n't	like	.
and	we	see	they	have	a	 vot 	 ing 	 	process	,	so	we	're	going	to	 s 	 end 	 	--	we	have	40,000	 member 	 s 	 	and	we	're	going	to	 s 	 end 	 	them	over	and	they	're	all	going	to	vote	and	get	these	 page 	 s 	 	 delet 	 ed 	 	.	``
well	,	they	 manage 	 d 	 	to	get	18	people	to	show	up	.	that	's	neo	-	nazi	math	for	you	.
they	 al 	 ways 	 	think	they	've	got	40,000	 member 	 s 	 	when	they	've	got	18	.
but	they	 manage 	 d 	 	to	get	18	people	to	come	and	vote	in	a	 fair 	 ly 	 	absurd	way	to	delete	a	 perfect 	 ly 	 	valid	article	.
of	course	,	the	vote	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 be 	 ing 	 	about	85	to	18	,	so	there	was	no	real	danger	to	our	 democrat 	 ic 	 	 process 	 es 	 	.
on	the	other	hand	,	people	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	but	what	are	we	going	to	do	?
i	mean	,	 th 	 is 	 	could	happen	and	what	if	some	group	 get 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 serious 	 ly 	 	 organize 	 d 	 	and	 come 	 s 	 	in	and	 want 	 s 	 	to	vote	?	``
then	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	fuck	it	,	we	'll	just	change	the	 rule 	 s 	 	.	``
that	's	my	job	in	the	community	:	to	say	we	wo	n't	allow	our	 open 	 ness 	 	and	 free 	 dom 	 	to	 under 	 mine 	 	the	quality	of	the	content	.
and	so	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	people	trust	me	in	my	role	,	then	that	's	a	valid	place	for	me	.
of	course	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	free	 licens 	 ing 	 	,	if	i	do	a	bad	job	,	the	 volunteer 	 s 	 	are	more	than	happy	to	take	and	 leav 	 e 	 	--
i	ca	n't	tell	 any 	 one 	 	what	to	do	.
so	the	final	point	here	is	that	to	understand	how	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	 work 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	understand	that	our	wiki	model	is	the	way	we	work	,	but	we	are	not	 fanatic 	 al 	 	web	 anarch 	 ists 	 	.	in	fact	,	we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 flex 	 ible 	 	about	the	social	 method 	 ology 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	the	 pass 	 ion 	 	of	the	community	is	for	the	quality	of	the	work	,
not	 necess 	 arily 	 	for	the	process	that	we	use	to	generate	it	.
thank	you	.
ben	saunders	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	hi	,	ben	saunders	.
jimmy	,	you	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	 im 	 partial 	 ity 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	a	key	to	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	's	success	.
it	 strike 	 s 	 	me	that	much	of	the	 text 	 book 	 s 	 	that	are	used	to	 educ 	 ate 	 	our	children	are	 inherent 	 ly 	 	 bias 	 ed 	 	.
have	you	found	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	used	by	 teacher 	 s 	 	,	and	how	do	you	see	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	changing	education	?
jimmy	wales	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	so	,	a	lot	of	 teacher 	 s 	 	are	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	use	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	.	there	's	a	media	 story 	 line 	 	about	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	,	which	i	think	is	false	.
it	 build 	 s 	 	on	the	 story 	 line 	 	of	 blogger 	 s 	 	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	 news 	 paper 	 s 	 	.
and	the	 story 	 line 	 	is	,	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	crazy	thing	,	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	,	but	 academic 	 s 	 	hate	it	and	 teacher 	 s 	 	hate	it	.	and	that	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	not	be	true	.
the	last	time	i	got	an	 e 	 - 	 mail 	 	from	a	journalist	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	why	do	 academic 	 s 	 	hate	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	?	``
i	 s 	 ent 	 	it	from	my	harvard	email	address	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 ap 	 point 	 ed 	 	a	fellow	there	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	they	do	n't	all	hate	it	.	``
but	i	think	there	's	going	to	be	huge	 impact 	 s 	 	.
and	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	a	project	that	i	'm	 personal 	 ly 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	,	which	is	the	wiki	 book 	 s 	 	project	,	which	is	an	effort	to	create	 text 	 book 	 s 	 	in	all	the	 language 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	a	much	 big 	 ger 	 	project	;	it	's	going	to	take	20	 year 	 s 	 	or	so	to	come	to	 fruit 	 ion 	 	.
but	part	of	that	is	to	fulfill	our	mission	of	giving	an	encyclopedia	to	every	single	person	on	the	planet	.
we	do	n't	mean	we	're	going	to	spam	them	with	aol	-	style	cds	.
we	mean	we	're	going	to	give	them	a	tool	that	they	can	use	.
and	for	a	lot	of	people	in	the	world	,	if	i	give	you	an	encyclopedia	that	's	written	at	a	university	level	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	do	you	any	good	 with 	 out 	 	a	whole	host	of	 liter 	 acy 	 	 material 	 s 	 	to	build	you	up	to	the	point	where	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	use	it	.
and	so	the	wiki	 book 	 s 	 	project	is	an	effort	to	do	that	.
and	i	think	that	we	're	going	to	 re 	 ally 	 	see	a	huge	--	it	may	not	even	come	from	us	;	there	's	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	going	on	.
but	 free 	 ly 	 	 licens 	 ed 	 	 text 	 book 	 s 	 	are	the	next	big	thing	in	education	.
