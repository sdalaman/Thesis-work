 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 represent 	 ation 	 	of	your	brain	,
and	your	brain	can	be	broken	 in 	 to 	 	two	 part 	 s 	 	.
there	's	the	left	half	,	which	is	the	logical	side	,	and	then	the	right	half	,	which	is	the	intuitive	.
and	so	if	we	had	a	scale	to	measure	the	 apt 	 itude 	 	of	each	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	,	then	we	can	plot	our	brain	.
and	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	would	be	 some 	 body 	 	who	's	 complete 	 ly 	 	logical	.
 th 	 is 	 	would	be	 some 	 one 	 	who	's	 entire 	 ly 	 	intuitive	.
so	where	would	you	put	your	brain	on	 th 	 is 	 	scale	?
some	of	us	may	have	 opt 	 ed 	 	for	one	of	these	 extrem 	 es 	 	,	but	i	think	for	most	people	in	the	audience	,	your	brain	is	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	--	with	a	high	 apt 	 itude 	 	in	both	 hemi 	 sphere 	 s 	 	at	the	same	time	.
it	's	not	like	they	're	 mutual 	 ly 	 	exclusive	or	 any 	 thing 	 	.
you	can	be	logical	and	intuitive	.
and	so	i	consider	 my 	 self 	 	one	of	these	people	,	 a 	 long 	 	with	most	of	the	other	 experiment 	 al 	 	 quant 	 um 	 	 physicist 	 s 	 	,	who	need	a	good	deal	of	logic	to	string	together	these	complex	 idea 	 s 	 	.
but	at	the	same	time	,	we	need	a	good	deal	of	 intuit 	 ion 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	make	the	 experiment 	 s 	 	work	.
how	do	we	develop	 th 	 is 	 	 intuit 	 ion 	 	?	well	we	like	to	play	with	stuff	.
so	we	go	out	and	play	with	it	,	and	then	we	see	how	it	 act 	 s 	 	,
and	then	we	develop	our	 intuit 	 ion 	 	from	there	.
and	 re 	 ally 	 	you	do	the	same	thing	.
so	some	 intuit 	 ion 	 	that	you	may	have	 develop 	 ed 	 	over	the	 year 	 s 	 	is	that	one	thing	is	 on 	 ly 	 	in	one	place	at	a	time	.
i	mean	,	it	can	sound	weird	to	think	about	one	thing	 be 	 ing 	 	in	two	different	 place 	 s 	 	at	the	same	time	,	but	you	 we 	 re 	 	n't	born	with	 th 	 is 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	,	you	 develop 	 ed 	 	it	.
and	i	remember	 watch 	 ing 	 	a	kid	 play 	 ing 	 	on	a	car	stop	.
he	was	just	a	toddler	and	he	was	n't	 ver 	 y 	 	good	at	it	,	and	he	 ke 	 pt 	 	 fall 	 ing 	 	over	.
but	i	bet	 play 	 ing 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	car	stop	taught	him	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 valu 	 able 	 	 less 	 on 	 	,	and	that	's	that	large	 thing 	 s 	 	do	n't	let	you	get	right	past	them	,	and	that	they	stay	in	one	place	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	great	conceptual	model	to	have	of	the	world	,	 un 	 less 	 	you	're	a	particle	physicist	.
it	'd	be	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	model	for	a	particle	physicist	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	do	n't	play	with	car	 stop 	 s 	 	,	they	play	with	these	little	weird	 particle 	 s 	 	.
and	when	they	play	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 particle 	 s 	 	,	they	find	they	do	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 re 	 ally 	 	weird	 thing 	 s 	 	--	like	they	can	fly	right	through	 wall 	 s 	 	,	or	they	can	be	in	two	different	 place 	 s 	 	at	the	same	time	.
and	so	they	wrote	down	all	these	 observ 	 ations 	 	,	and	they	 call 	 ed 	 	it	the	 theor 	 y 	 	of	 quant 	 um 	 	 mechanic 	 s 	 	.
and	so	that	's	where	physics	was	at	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	;	you	 need 	 ed 	 	 quant 	 um 	 	 mechanic 	 s 	 	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	little	,	 tin 	 y 	 	 particle 	 s 	 	.
but	you	did	n't	need	it	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	the	large	,	 every 	 day 	 	 object 	 s 	 	around	us	.
 th 	 is 	 	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 it 	 	well	with	my	 intuit 	 ion 	 	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	it	's	just	 be 	 cause 	 	i	do	n't	play	with	 particle 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	often	.
well	,	i	play	with	them	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	but	not	 ver 	 y 	 	often	.
and	i	've	never	 s 	 een 	 	them	.
i	mean	,	 no 	 body 	 	's	ever	 s 	 een 	 	a	particle	.
but	it	did	n't	 s 	 it 	 	well	with	my	logical	side	either	.
 be 	 cause 	 	if	 every 	 thing 	 	is	made	up	of	little	 particle 	 s 	 	and	all	the	little	 particle 	 s 	 	follow	 quant 	 um 	 	 mechanic 	 s 	 	,	then	should	n't	 every 	 thing 	 	just	follow	 quant 	 um 	 	 mechanic 	 s 	 	?
i	do	n't	see	any	reason	why	it	should	n't	.
and	so	i	'd	feel	a	lot	better	about	the	whole	thing	if	we	could	 some 	 how 	 	show	that	an	 every 	 day 	 	object	 al 	 so 	 	 follow 	 s 	 	 quant 	 um 	 	 mechanic 	 s 	 	.
so	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	set	off	to	do	just	that	.
so	i	made	one	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	object	that	you	can	see	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	in	a	 mechanic 	 al 	 	 quant 	 um 	 	 super 	 position 	 	.
so	what	we	're	looking	at	here	is	a	 tin 	 y 	 	computer	chip	.
and	you	can	sort	of	see	 th 	 is 	 	green	dot	right	in	the	middle	.
and	that	's	 th 	 is 	 	piece	of	metal	i	'm	going	to	be	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	in	a	minute	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	photograph	of	the	object	.
and	here	i	'll	zoom	in	a	little	bit	.	we	're	looking	right	there	in	the	center	.	and	then	here	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	big	close	-	up	of	the	little	piece	of	metal	.
so	what	we	're	looking	at	is	a	little	chunk	of	metal	,	and	it	's	shaped	like	a	 div 	 ing 	 	board	,	and	it	's	 stick 	 ing 	 	out	over	a	ledge	.
and	so	i	made	 th 	 is 	 	thing	in	 near 	 ly 	 	the	same	way	 a 	 s 	 	you	make	a	computer	chip	.
i	went	 in 	 to 	 	a	clean	room	with	a	fresh	silicon	wafer	,	and	then	i	just	 crank 	 ed 	 	away	at	all	the	big	 machine 	 s 	 	for	about	100	 hour 	 s 	 	.
for	the	last	stuff	,	i	had	to	build	my	own	machine	--	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	 swimm 	 ing 	 	pool	-	shaped	hole	 under 	 neath 	 	the	 de 	 vice 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	the	ability	to	be	in	a	 quant 	 um 	 	 super 	 position 	 	,	but	it	 need 	 s 	 	a	little	help	to	do	it	.
here	,	let	me	give	you	an	 analog 	 y 	 	.
you	know	how	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	it	is	to	be	in	a	 crowd 	 ed 	 	 elev 	 ator 	 	?
i	mean	,	when	i	'm	in	an	 elev 	 ator 	 	all	 al 	 one 	 	,	i	do	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	weird	 thing 	 s 	 	,	but	then	other	people	get	on	board	and	i	stop	 do 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	do	n't	want	to	 both 	 er 	 	them	,	or	,	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	 s 	 care 	 	them	.
so	 quant 	 um 	 	 mechanic 	 s 	 	 say 	 s 	 	that	 in 	 animate 	 	 object 	 s 	 	feel	the	same	way	.
the	fellow	 passenger 	 s 	 	for	 in 	 animate 	 	 object 	 s 	 	are	not	just	people	,	but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	the	light	 shin 	 ing 	 	on	it	and	the	wind	 blow 	 ing 	 	past	it	and	the	heat	of	the	room	.
and	so	we	 k 	 new 	 	,	if	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	see	 th 	 is 	 	piece	of	metal	 behav 	 e 	 	 quant 	 um 	 	 mechanic 	 ally 	 	,	we	're	going	to	have	to	kick	out	all	the	other	 passenger 	 s 	 	.
and	so	that	's	what	we	did	.
we	 turn 	 ed 	 	off	the	 light 	 s 	 	,	and	then	we	put	it	in	a	vacuum	and	 suck 	 ed 	 	out	all	the	air	,	and	then	we	 cool 	 ed 	 	it	down	to	just	a	fraction	of	a	degree	above	absolute	zero	.
now	,	all	 al 	 one 	 	in	the	 elev 	 ator 	 	,	the	little	chunk	of	metal	is	free	to	act	 how 	 ever 	 	it	 want 	 ed 	 	.
and	so	we	 measur 	 ed 	 	 it 	 s 	 	motion	.
we	found	it	was	moving	in	 re 	 ally 	 	weird	ways	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	just	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	 perfect 	 ly 	 	still	,	it	was	 vib 	 rating 	 	,
and	the	way	it	was	 vib 	 rating 	 	was	 breath 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	--	like	 expand 	 ing 	 	and	 contract 	 ing 	 	 bel 	 low 	 s 	 	.
and	by	giving	it	a	gentle	nudge	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	make	it	both	 vib 	 rate 	 	and	not	 vib 	 rate 	 	at	the	same	time	--	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	 on 	 ly 	 	 allow 	 ed 	 	with	 quant 	 um 	 	 mechanic 	 s 	 	.
so	what	i	'm	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	here	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 tru 	 ly 	 	fantastic	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	it	mean	for	one	thing	to	be	both	 vib 	 rating 	 	and	not	 vib 	 rating 	 	at	the	same	time	?
so	let	's	think	about	the	 atom 	 s 	 	.
so	in	one	case	:	all	the	 trillion 	 s 	 	of	 atom 	 s 	 	that	make	up	that	chunk	of	metal	are	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	still	and	at	the	same	time	 t 	 hose 	 	same	 atom 	 s 	 	are	moving	up	and	down	.
now	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	at	precise	 time 	 s 	 	when	they	align	.
the	rest	of	the	time	they	're	delocalized	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	every	atom	is	in	two	different	 place 	 s 	 	at	the	same	time	,	which	in	turn	 mean 	 s 	 	the	entire	chunk	of	metal	is	in	two	different	 place 	 s 	 	.
i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	.
 re 	 ally 	 	.
it	was	worth	 lock 	 ing 	 	 my 	 self 	 	in	a	clean	room	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	for	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 year 	 s 	 
 be 	 cause 	 	,	check	 th 	 is 	 	out	,	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	scale	between	a	single	atom	and	that	chunk	of	metal	is	about	the	same	 a 	 s 	 	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	that	chunk	of	metal	and	you	.
so	if	a	single	atom	can	be	in	two	different	 place 	 s 	 	at	the	same	time	,	that	chunk	of	metal	can	be	in	two	different	 place 	 s 	 	,	then	why	not	you	?
i	mean	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	my	logical	side	 talk 	 ing 	 	.
so	imagine	if	you	're	in	 multi 	 ple 	 	 place 	 s 	 	at	the	same	time	,	what	would	that	be	like	?
how	would	your	 conscious 	 ness 	 	handle	your	body	 be 	 ing 	 	delocalized	in	space	?
there	's	one	more	part	to	the	story	.
it	's	when	we	 warm 	 ed 	 	it	up	,	and	we	 turn 	 ed 	 	on	the	 light 	 s 	 	and	 look 	 ed 	 	 in 	 side 	 	the	box	,	we	saw	that	the	piece	metal	was	still	there	in	one	piece	.
and	so	i	had	to	develop	 th 	 is 	 	new	 intuit 	 ion 	 	,	that	it	 seem 	 s 	 	like	all	the	 object 	 s 	 	in	the	 elev 	 ator 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	just	 quant 	 um 	 	 object 	 s 	 	just	 cram 	 med 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 tin 	 y 	 	space	.
you	hear	a	lot	of	talk	about	how	 quant 	 um 	 	 mechanic 	 s 	 	 say 	 s 	 	that	 every 	 thing 	 	is	all	 interconnect 	 ed 	 	.
well	,	that	's	not	 quit 	 e 	 	right	.	it	's	more	than	that	;	it	's	 deep 	 er 	 	.
it	's	that	 t 	 hose 	 	 connect 	 ions 	 	,	your	 connect 	 ions 	 	to	all	the	 thing 	 s 	 	around	you	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	define	who	you	are	,
and	that	's	the	 pro 	 found 	 	 weird 	 ness 	 	of	 quant 	 um 	 	 mechanic 	 s 	 	.
thank	you	.
