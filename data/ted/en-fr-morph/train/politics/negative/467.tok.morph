fifty	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	when	i	 beg 	 an 	 	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	the	ocean	,	no	one	--	not	jacques	perrin	,	not	jacques	cousteau	or	rachel	carson	--	 imagin 	 ed 	 	that	we	could	do	 any 	 thing 	 	to	harm	the	ocean	by	what	we	put	 in 	 to 	 	it	or	by	what	we	took	out	of	it	.
it	 seem 	 ed 	 	,	at	that	time	,	to	be	a	sea	of	eden	,	but	now	we	know	,	and	now	we	are	facing	 para 	 dis 	 e 	 	lost	.
i	want	to	share	with	you	my	personal	view	of	 change 	 s 	 	in	the	sea	that	affect	all	of	us	,	and	to	consider	why	it	 matter 	 s 	 	that	in	50	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	've	lost	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	we	've	taken	,	we	've	eaten	--	more	than	90	percent	of	the	big	fish	in	the	sea	;	why	you	should	care	that	 near 	 ly 	 	half	of	the	coral	 reef 	 s 	 	have	 disappear 	 ed 	 	;	why	a	 myster 	 ious 	 	 deple 	 tion 	 	of	oxygen	in	large	 area 	 s 	 	of	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	should	concern	not	 on 	 ly 	 	the	 creature 	 s 	 	that	are	 dy 	 ing 	 	,	but	it	 re 	 ally 	 	should	concern	you	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	concern	you	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
i	'm	 haunt 	 ed 	 	by	the	thought	of	what	ray	anderson	 call 	 s 	 	``	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	's	child	,	``	 ask 	 ing 	 	why	we	did	n't	do	 some 	 thing 	 	on	our	watch	to	 s 	 ave 	 	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	and	 blue 	 fin 	 	tuna	and	 s 	 quid 	 s 	 	and	coral	 reef 	 s 	 	and	the	living	ocean	while	there	still	was	time	.

did	i	say	that	?	i	guess	i	did	.
for	me	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	scientist	,	it	all	 beg 	 an 	 	in	1953	when	i	first	 tri 	 ed 	 	scuba	.
it	's	when	i	first	got	to	know	fish	 swimm 	 ing 	 	in	 some 	 thing 	 	other	than	lemon	 slice 	 s 	 	and	butter	.
i	 actual 	 ly 	 	love	 div 	 ing 	 	at	night	;
you	see	a	lot	of	fish	then	that	you	do	n't	see	in	the	 day 	 time 	 	.
 div 	 ing 	 	day	and	night	was	 re 	 ally 	 	easy	for	me	in	1970	,	when	i	led	a	team	of	 aqua 	 nauts 	 	living	 under 	 water 	 	for	 week 	 s 	 	at	a	time	--	at	the	same	time	that	 astro 	 nauts 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 put 	 ting 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 foot 	 print 	 s 	 	on	the	moon	.
in	1979	i	had	a	chance	to	put	my	 foot 	 print 	 s 	 	on	the	ocean	floor	while	using	 th 	 is 	 	personal	submersible	 call 	 ed 	 	jim	.
it	was	six	 mile 	 s 	 	 off 	 shore 	 	and	1,250	feet	down	.
it	's	one	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 bath 	 ing 	 	 suit 	 s 	 	.
since	then	,	i	've	used	about	30	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 sub 	 marine 	 s 	 	and	i	've	 start 	 ed 	 	three	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	and	a	 non 	 profit 	 	 found 	 ation 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	deep	search	to	design	and	build	 system 	 s 	 	to	access	the	deep	sea	.

they	're	so	simple	to	drive	that	even	a	scientist	can	do	it	.
and	i	'm	living	proof	.

i	heard	 astro 	 naut 	 	joe	allen	explain	how	he	had	to	learn	 every 	 thing 	 	he	could	about	his	life	support	system	and	then	do	 every 	 thing 	 	he	could	to	take	care	of	his	life	support	system	;

97	percent	of	the	land	in	the	galapagos	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	is	 protect 	 ed 	 	,	but	the	 ad 	 ja 	 cent 	 	sea	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 ravage 	 d 	 	by	 fish 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	true	too	in	argentina	on	the	patagonian	shelf	,	which	is	now	in	serious	trouble	.
the	high	 sea 	 s 	 	,	where	 whale 	 s 	 	,	tuna	and	 dolphin 	 s 	 	travel	--	the	largest	,	 l 	 east 	 	 protect 	 ed 	 	,	 eco 	 system 	 	on	earth	,	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	 lumin 	 ous 	 	 creature 	 s 	 	,	living	in	dark	 water 	 s 	 	that	average	two	 mile 	 s 	 	deep	.
they	flash	,	and	 spark 	 le 	 	,	and	glow	with	 the 	 ir 	 	own	living	light	.
there	are	still	 place 	 s 	 	in	the	sea	 a 	 s 	 	 pr 	 ist 	 ine 	 	 a 	 s 	 	i	 k 	 new 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	child	.
the	next	10	 year 	 s 	 	may	be	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	,	and	the	next	10,000	 year 	 s 	 	the	best	chance	our	species	will	have	to	protect	what	 remain 	 s 	 	of	the	natural	 system 	 s 	 	that	give	us	life	.
to	cope	with	climate	change	,	we	need	new	ways	to	generate	power	.
we	need	new	ways	,	better	ways	,	to	cope	with	poverty	,	 war 	 s 	 	and	disease	.
we	need	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	to	keep	and	maintain	the	world	 a 	 s 	 	a	better	place	.
but	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	else	will	matter	if	we	fail	to	protect	the	ocean	.
our	fate	and	the	ocean	's	are	one	.
we	need	to	do	for	the	ocean	what	al	gore	did	for	the	 ski 	 es 	 	above	.
a	global	plan	of	action	with	a	world	 conserv 	 ation 	 	 un 	 ion 	 	,	the	iucn	,	is	 under 	 way 	 	to	protect	 bio 	 divers 	 ity 	 	,	to	 mitig 	 ate 	 	and	 re 	 cover 	 	from	the	 impact 	 s 	 	of	climate	change	,
on	the	high	 sea 	 s 	 	and	in	 coast 	 al 	 	 area 	 s 	 	,	 where 	 ver 	 	we	can	identify	critical	 place 	 s 	 	.	new	 techno 	 logies 	 	are	 need 	 ed 	 	to	map	,	photograph	and	explore	the	95	percent	of	the	ocean	that	we	have	yet	to	see	.
the	goal	is	to	protect	 bio 	 divers 	 ity 	 	,	to	provide	 st 	 ability 	 	and	 resili 	 ence 	 	.
we	need	deep	-	 div 	 ing 	 	 sub 	 s 	 	,	new	 techno 	 logies 	 	to	explore	the	ocean	.
we	need	,	 may 	 be 	 	,	an	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 	--	a	ted	at	sea	--	that	could	help	figure	out	the	next	 step 	 s 	 	.
and	so	,	i	suppose	you	want	to	know	what	my	wish	is	.
i	wish	you	would	use	all	 mean 	 s 	 	at	your	 dispos 	 al 	 	--	 film 	 s 	 	,	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 s 	 	,	the	web	,	new	 sub 	 marine 	 s 	 	--	and	campaign	to	ignite	public	support	for	a	global	network	of	marine	 protect 	 ed 	 	 area 	 s 	 	--	hope	 spot 	 s 	 	large	 en 	 ough 	 	to	 s 	 ave 	 	and	 re 	 store 	 	the	ocean	,	the	blue	heart	of	the	planet	.
how	much	?
some	say	10	percent	,	some	say	30	percent	.
you	decide	:	how	much	of	your	heart	do	you	want	to	protect	?
 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	,	a	fraction	of	one	percent	is	not	 en 	 ough 	 	.
my	wish	is	a	big	wish	,	but	if	we	can	make	it	happen	,	it	can	 tru 	 ly 	 	change	the	world	,	and	help	ensure	the	 surviv 	 al 	 	of	what	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	--	is	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	species	;	that	would	be	us	.
for	the	children	of	 to 	 day 	 	,	for	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	's	child	:	 a 	 s 	 	never	 aga 	 in 	 	,	now	is	the	time	.
thank	you	.
