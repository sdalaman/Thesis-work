 th 	 is 	 	is	your	 con 	 ference 	 	,	and	i	think	you	have	a	right	to	know	a	little	bit	right	now	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	 transit 	 ion 	 	period	,	about	 th 	 is 	 	guy	who	's	going	to	be	looking	after	it	for	you	for	a	bit	.
so	,	i	'm	just	going	to	grab	a	chair	here	.
two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	at	ted	,	i	think	--	i	've	come	to	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 clusion 	 	--	i	think	i	may	have	 be 	 en 	 	 suffer 	 ing 	 	from	a	strange	delusion	.
i	think	that	i	may	have	 believ 	 ed 	 	 un 	 conscious 	 ly 	 	,	then	,	that	i	was	kind	of	a	business	hero	.
i	had	 th 	 is 	 	company	that	i	'd	 s 	 pent 	 	15	 year 	 s 	 	building	.	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	future	;
it	was	a	magazine	 publish 	 ing 	 	company	.
it	had	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	gone	public	and	the	market	 s 	 aid 	 	that	it	was	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	worth	two	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	a	number	i	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	understand	.
a	magazine	i	'd	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 launch 	 ed 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	business	2.0	was	 fat 	 ter 	 	than	a	 tele 	 phone 	 	 director 	 y 	 	,	 bus 	 y 	 	 pump 	 ing 	 	hot	air	 in 	 to 	 	the	bubble	.	and	i	was	the	40	percent	owner	of	a	 dot 	 com 	 	that	was	about	to	go	public	and	no	doubt	be	worth	 billion 	 s 	 	more	.
and	all	 th 	 is 	 	had	come	from	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
fifteen	 year 	 s 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	,	i	was	a	science	journalist	who	people	just	 laugh 	 ed 	 	at	when	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	 re 	 ally 	 	would	like	to	start	my	own	computer	magazine	.	``
and	15	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	there	are	100	of	them
and	2,000	people	on	staff	and	it	was	just	 s 	 uch 	 	 head 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	.
the	date	was	february	2000	.
i	thought	the	little	graph	of	my	business	life	that	kind	of	 look 	 ed 	 	a	bit	like	moore	's	law	--	i	mean	,	it	had	to	.	right	?	i	was	in	for	 quit 	 e 	 	a	surprise	.
the	 dot 	 com 	 	,	 iron 	 ically 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 snow 	 ball 	 	,	was	the	 ver 	 y 	 	last	consumer	web	company	to	go	public	the	next	month	before	nasdaq	 explode 	 d 	 	,	and	i	 enter 	 ed 	 	18	 month 	 s 	 	of	business	hell	.
i	 watch 	 ed 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	that	i	'd	built	 crumb 	 ling 	 	,
and	it	 look 	 ed 	 	like	all	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	was	going	to	die	and	15	 year 	 s 	 	work	would	have	come	for	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
and	it	was	gut	 wrench 	 ing 	 	.
it	took	eight	 year 	 s 	 	of	blood	,	sweat	and	 tear 	 s 	 	to	reach	350	 employ 	 ees 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	which	i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	proud	of	in	the	business	.
february	2001	--	in	one	day	we	laid	off	350	people	,	and	before	the	 blood 	 shed 	 	was	 finish 	 ed 	 	,	1,000	people	had	lost	 the 	 ir 	 	 job 	 s 	 	from	my	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.	i	felt	sick	.
i	 watch 	 ed 	 	my	own	net	worth	 fall 	 ing 	 	by	about	a	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	day	,	every	day	,	for	18	 month 	 s 	 	.
and	 wo 	 rse 	 	than	that	,	far	 wo 	 rse 	 	than	that	,	my	sense	of	self	-	worth	was	kind	of	 evapo 	 rating 	 	.
i	was	going	around	with	 th 	 is 	 	big	sign	on	my	 fore 	 head 	 	:	``	 lose 	 r 	 	.	``
and	i	think	what	 disgust 	 s 	 	me	more	than	 any 	 thing 	 	,	looking	back	,	is	how	the	hell	did	i	let	my	personal	happiness	get	so	 ti 	 ed 	 	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	business	thing	?
well	,	in	the	end	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	 s 	 ave 	 	future	and	 snow 	 ball 	 	,	but	i	was	,	at	that	point	,	ready	to	move	on	.	and	to	cut	a	long	story	short	,	here	's	where	i	came	to	.
and	the	reason	i	'm	 tell 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	story	is	that	i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	from	 man 	 y 	 	 conversation 	 s 	 	,	that	a	lot	of	people	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	have	 be 	 en 	 	through	a	similar	kind	of	 roller 	 coast 	 er 	 	--	 emotion 	 al 	 	 roller 	 coast 	 er 	 	--	in	the	last	couple	 year 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	big	,	big	 transit 	 ion 	 	time	,	and	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	can	play	a	big	part	for	all	of	us	in	taking	us	forward	to	the	next	stage	to	 what 	 ever 	 	's	next	.
the	theme	next	year	is	re	-	birth	.
it	was	at	the	same	ted	two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	when	richard	and	i	 reach 	 ed 	 	an	 agree 	 ment 	 	on	the	future	of	ted	.
and	at	about	the	same	time	,	and	i	think	 part 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	that	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	'd	 for 	 gotten 	 	about	in	my	business	focus	:
i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	read	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	while	i	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 bus 	 y 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	business	 game 	 s 	 	,	there	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	revolution	in	so	 man 	 y 	 	 area 	 s 	 	of	interest	:	 cosmo 	 logy 	 	to	 psycho 	 logy 	 	to	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 psycho 	 logy 	 	to	 anthropo 	 logy 	 	to	...	all	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	had	 change 	 d 	 	.
and	the	way	in	which	you	could	think	about	us	 a 	 s 	 	a	species	and	us	 a 	 s 	 	a	planet	had	just	 change 	 d 	 	so	much	,	and	it	was	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	.
and	what	was	 re 	 ally 	 	most	 excit 	 ing 	 	--	and	i	think	richard	wurman	 discover 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	at	 l 	 east 	 	20	 year 	 s 	 	before	i	did	--	was	that	all	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	is	 connect 	 ed 	 	.
it	's	 connect 	 ed 	 	;	it	all	 hook 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	each	other	.
we	talk	about	 th 	 is 	 	a	lot	,	and	i	thought	about	 try 	 ing 	 	to	give	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	.	so	,	just	one	 ex 	 ample 	 	:
madame	de	gaulle	,	the	wife	of	the	french	 p 	 resident 	 	,	was	 famous 	 ly 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	once	,	``	what	do	you	most	 desir 	 e 	 	?	``
and	she	 answer 	 ed 	 	,	``	a	penis	.	``
and	when	you	think	about	it	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	true	:
what	we	all	most	 desir 	 e 	 	is	a	penis	--
or	``	happiness	``	 a 	 s 	 	we	say	in	english	.
and	 some 	 thing 	 	...	good	luck	with	that	one	in	the	japanese	 transl 	 ation 	 	room	.
but	 some 	 thing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 bas 	 ic 	 	 a 	 s 	 	happiness	,	which	20	 year 	 s 	 	ago	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	just	 some 	 thing 	 	for	 discuss 	 ion 	 	in	the	church	or	mosque	or	 s 	 y 	 nag 	 ogue 	 	,	 to 	 day 	 	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	there	's	 dozen 	 s 	 	of	ted	-	like	 question 	 s 	 	that	you	can	ask	about	it	,	which	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
you	can	ask	about	what	 cause 	 s 	 	it	 bio 	 chemical 	 ly 	 	:	 neuro 	 science 	 	,	serotonin	,	all	that	stuff	.
you	can	ask	what	are	the	 psycho 	 logical 	 	 cause 	 s 	 	of	it	:
nature	?	nurture	?	current	 circum 	 stance 	 	?
 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	the	research	 d 	 one 	 	on	that	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	mind	-	 blow 	 ing 	 	.
you	can	view	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	computing	problem	,	an	artificial	 intellig 	 ence 	 	problem	:
do	you	need	to	 in 	 corporate 	 	some	sort	of	analog	of	happiness	 in 	 to 	 	a	computer	brain	to	make	it	work	 proper 	 ly 	 	?
you	can	view	it	in	sort	of	 geo 	 politic 	 al 	 	 term 	 s 	 	and	say	,	why	is	it	that	a	billion	people	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	are	so	 desperate 	 ly 	 	 need 	 y 	 	that	they	have	no	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	happiness	,	and	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	 al 	 most 	 	all	the	rest	of	them	,	 regard 	 less 	 	of	how	much	money	they	have	--	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	two	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	day	or	 what 	 ever 	 	--	are	 al 	 most 	 	 equal 	 ly 	 	happy	on	average	?
or	you	can	view	it	 a 	 s 	 	an	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 psycho 	 logy 	 	kind	of	thing	:
did	our	 gene 	 s 	 	invent	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	trick	to	get	us	to	 behav 	 e 	 	in	certain	ways	?	the	ant	's	brain	,	 parasit 	 ized 	 	,	to	make	us	 behav 	 e 	 	in	certain	ways	so	that	our	 gene 	 s 	 	would	 propag 	 ate 	 	?
are	we	the	 victim 	 s 	 	of	a	mass	delusion	?
and	so	on	,	and	so	on	.
to	understand	even	 some 	 thing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	us	 a 	 s 	 	happiness	,	you	kind	of	have	to	branch	off	in	all	these	different	 direction 	 s 	 	,	and	there	's	 no 	 where 	 	that	i	've	 discover 	 ed 	 	--	other	than	ted	--	where	you	can	ask	that	 man 	 y 	 	 question 	 s 	 	in	that	 man 	 y 	 	different	 direction 	 s 	 	.
and	so	,	it	's	the	 pro 	 found 	 	thing	that	richard	 talk 	 s 	 	about	:	to	understand	 any 	 thing 	 	,	you	just	need	to	understand	the	little	bits	;
a	little	bit	about	 every 	 thing 	 	that	 surround 	 s 	 	it	.
and	so	,	 gradu 	 ally 	 	over	these	three	 day 	 s 	 	,	you	start	off	kind	of	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	,	``	why	am	i	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	all	 th 	 is 	 	 ir 	 relevant 	 	stuff	?	``
and	at	the	end	of	the	four	 day 	 s 	 	,	your	brain	is	humming	and	you	feel	 energ 	 ized 	 	,	 al 	 ive 	 	and	 excit 	 ed 	 	,	and	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	all	these	different	bits	have	 be 	 en 	 	put	together	.
it	's	the	total	brain	experience	,	we	're	going	to	...	it	's	the	mental	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	the	full	body	 mass 	 age 	 	.
every	mental	organ	 address 	 ed 	 	.	it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	.
 en 	 ough 	 	of	the	 theor 	 y 	 	,	chris	.	tell	us	what	you	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	to	do	,	all	right	?
so	,	i	will	.	here	's	the	vision	for	ted	.
number	one	:	do	 noth 	 ing 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	thing	ai	n't	broke	,	so	i	ai	n't	gon	na	fix	it	.
jeff	bezos	 kind 	 ly 	 	 remark 	 ed 	 	to	me	,	``	chris	,	ted	is	a	 re 	 ally 	 	great	 con 	 ference 	 	.
you	're	going	to	have	to	fuck	up	 re 	 ally 	 	 bad 	 ly 	 	to	make	it	bad	.	``
so	,	i	 g 	 ave 	 	 my 	 self 	 	the	job	title	of	ted	custodian	for	a	reason	,	and	i	will	promise	you	right	here	and	now	that	the	core	 value 	 s 	 	that	make	ted	special	are	not	going	to	be	 interfere 	 d 	 	with	.
truth	,	curiosity	,	 divers 	 ity 	 	,	no	selling	,	no	corporate	 bull 	 shit 	 	,	no	 band 	 wagon 	 ing 	 	,	no	 platform 	 s 	 	.
just	the	 pur 	 suit 	 	of	interest	,	 where 	 ver 	 	it	lies	,	 a 	 cross 	 	all	the	 discipline 	 s 	 	that	are	 represent 	 ed 	 	here	.
that	's	not	going	to	be	 change 	 d 	 	at	all	.
number	two	:	i	am	going	to	put	together	an	 in 	 credible 	 	line	up	of	 speaker 	 s 	 	for	next	year	.
the	time	scale	on	which	ted	 oper 	 ates 	 	is	just	fantastic	after	coming	out	of	a	magazine	business	with	 month 	 ly 	 	 dead 	 lines 	 	.
there	's	a	year	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	 al 	 ready 	 	--	i	hope	to	show	you	a	bit	 lat 	 er 	 	--	there	's	25	or	so	 terr 	 ific 	 	 speaker 	 s 	 	 sign 	 ed 	 	up	for	next	year	.
and	i	'm	 get 	 ting 	 	fantastic	help	from	the	community	;	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	 s 	 uch 	 	a	great	community	.	and	 combine 	 d 	 	,	our	 contact 	 s 	 	reach	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 every 	 one 	 	who	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	in	the	country	,	if	not	the	planet	.
it	's	true	.
number	three	:	i	do	want	to	,	if	i	can	,	find	a	way	of	 extend 	 ing 	 	the	ted	experience	 through 	 out 	 	the	year	a	little	bit	.
and	one	key	way	that	we	're	going	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	is	to	 introduc 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	book	club	.
 book 	 s 	 	kind	of	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	me	in	the	last	couple	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	that	's	a	gift	that	i	would	like	to	pass	on	.	so	,	when	you	sign	up	for	ted	2003	,	every	six	 week 	 s 	 	you	'll	get	a	care	package	with	a	book	or	two	and	a	reason	why	they	're	linked	to	ted	.
they	may	well	be	by	a	ted	speaker	,	and	so	we	can	get	the	conversation	going	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	year	and	come	back	next	year	 hav 	 ing 	 	had	the	same	intellectual	,	 emotion 	 al 	 	journey	.
i	think	it	will	be	great	.
and	then	,	 fourth 	 ly 	 	:	i	want	to	 ment 	 ion 	 	the	sapling	 found 	 ation 	 	,	which	is	the	new	owner	of	ted	.
what	sapling	's	 owner 	 ship 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	is	that	all	of	the	 proceed 	 s 	 	of	ted	will	go	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	 cause 	 s 	 	that	sapling	 stand 	 s 	 	for	.
and	more	 import 	 ant 	 	,	i	think	,	the	 idea 	 s 	 	that	are	 exhibit 	 ed 	 	and	 real 	 ized 	 	here	are	 idea 	 s 	 	that	the	 found 	 ation 	 	can	use	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	fantastic	 syn 	 er 	 gy 	 	.
 al 	 ready 	 	,	just	in	the	last	few	 day 	 s 	 	,	we	've	had	so	 man 	 y 	 	people	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	stuff	that	they	care	about	,	that	they	're	passionate	about	,	that	can	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	the	world	,	and	the	idea	of	 get 	 ting 	 	 th 	 is 	 	group	of	people	together	--	some	of	the	 cause 	 s 	 	that	we	 believ 	 e 	 	in	,	the	money	that	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	can	raise	and	the	 idea 	 s 	 	--	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	that	combination	will	,	over	time	,	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
i	'm	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	that	.
in	fact	,	i	do	n't	think	,	 over 	 all 	 	,	that	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	by	 any 	 thing 	 	ever	in	my	life	.
i	'm	in	 th 	 is 	 	for	the	long	run	,	and	i	would	be	 great 	 ly 	 	 honor 	 ed 	 	and	 excit 	 ed 	 	if	you	'll	come	on	 th 	 is 	 	journey	with	me	.
