i	'm	here	to	talk	to	you	about	the	economic	 in 	 vis 	 ibility 	 	of	nature	.
the	bad	news	is	that	mother	nature	's	back	 off 	 ice 	 	is	n't	 work 	 ing 	 	yet	,	so	 t 	 hose 	 	 in 	 voice 	 s 	 	do	n't	get	 issue 	 d 	 	.
but	we	need	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	problem	.
i	 beg 	 an 	 	my	life	 a 	 s 	 	a	 market 	 s 	 	professional	and	 continu 	 ed 	 	to	take	an	interest	,	but	most	of	my	 re 	 cent 	 	effort	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	looking	at	the	value	of	what	 come 	 s 	 	to	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	from	nature	,	and	which	 do 	 es 	 	n't	get	priced	by	the	 market 	 s 	 	.
a	project	 call 	 ed 	 	teeb	was	 start 	 ed 	 	in	2007	,	and	it	was	 launch 	 ed 	 	by	a	group	of	environment	 mini 	 sters 	 	of	the	g	8	+	5	.
and	 the 	 ir 	 	 bas 	 ic 	 	inspiration	was	a	 ster 	 n 	 	review	of	lord	 ster 	 n 	 	.
they	 ask 	 ed 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	a	question	:	if	 economic 	 s 	 	could	make	 s 	 uch 	 	a	convincing	case	for	early	action	on	climate	change	,	well	why	ca	n't	the	same	be	 d 	 one 	 	for	 conserv 	 ation 	 	?
why	ca	n't	an	 equi 	 valent 	 	case	be	made	for	nature	?
and	the	answer	is	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	it	can	.
but	it	's	not	that	 straight 	 forward 	 	.
 bio 	 divers 	 ity 	 	,	the	living	fabric	of	 th 	 is 	 	planet	,	is	not	a	gas	.
it	 exist 	 s 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	 layer 	 s 	 	,	 eco 	 system 	 s 	 	,	species	and	 gene 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 scale 	 s 	 	--	 inter 	 national 	 	,	national	,	local	,	community	--	and	 do 	 ing 	 	for	nature	what	lord	 ster 	 n 	 	and	his	team	did	for	nature	is	not	that	easy	.
and	yet	,	we	 beg 	 an 	 	.
we	 beg 	 an 	 	the	project	with	an	 inter 	 im 	 	report	,	which	 quick 	 ly 	 	 pull 	 ed 	 	together	a	lot	of	information	that	had	 be 	 en 	 	 collect 	 ed 	 	on	the	subject	by	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 research 	 ers 	 	.
and	 among 	 st 	 	our	 compil 	 ed 	 	 result 	 s 	 	was	the	 start 	 ling 	 	 revel 	 ation 	 	that	,	in	fact	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	natural	capital	--	the	 benefit 	 s 	 	that	flow	from	nature	to	us	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	it	at	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	rate	--	in	fact	,	of	the	order	of	two	to	four	trillion	 dollar 	 s 	 	-	worth	of	natural	capital	.
 th 	 is 	 	came	out	in	2008	,	which	was	,	of	course	,	around	the	time	that	the	 bank 	 ing 	 	crisis	had	 show 	 n 	 	that	we	had	lost	financial	capital	of	the	order	of	two	and	a	half	trillion	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	was	 compar 	 able 	 	in	 s 	 ize 	 	to	that	kind	of	loss	.
we	then	have	gone	on	since	to	present	for	[	the	]	 inter 	 national 	 	community	,	for	 government 	 s 	 	,	for	local	 government 	 s 	 	and	for	business	and	for	people	,	for	you	and	me	,	a	whole	slew	of	 report 	 s 	 	,	which	 we 	 re 	 	 present 	 ed 	 	at	the	u.n.	last	year	,	which	address	the	economic	 in 	 vis 	 ibility 	 	of	nature	and	 de 	 scribe 	 	what	can	be	 d 	 one 	 	to	solve	it	.
what	is	 th 	 is 	 	about	?
a	picture	that	you	're	familiar	with	--	the	amazon	 rain 	 forest 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	massive	store	of	carbon	,	it	's	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	store	of	 bio 	 divers 	 ity 	 	,	but	what	people	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	know	is	 th 	 is 	 	 al 	 so 	 	is	a	rain	 factor 	 y 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	 north 	 eastern 	 	trade	 wind 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	they	go	over	the	amazonas	,	 effective 	 ly 	 	gather	the	water	vapor	.
 some 	 thing 	 	like	20	billion	 ton 	 s 	 	per	day	of	water	vapor	is	 suck 	 ed 	 	up	by	the	 north 	 eastern 	 	trade	 wind 	 s 	 	,	and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 precipit 	 ates 	 	in	the	form	of	rain	 a 	 cross 	 	the	la	plata	basin	.
 th 	 is 	 	 rain 	 fall 	 	cycle	,	 th 	 is 	 	 rain 	 fall 	 	 factor 	 y 	 	,	 effective 	 ly 	 	 feed 	 s 	 	an	 agricultur 	 al 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	of	the	order	of	240	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	-	worth	in	latin	america	.
but	the	question	 arise 	 s 	 	:	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	how	much	do	uruguay	,	paraguay	,	argentina	and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	the	state	of	mato	grosso	in	brazil	pay	for	that	vital	 in 	 put 	 	to	that	 eco 	 nomy 	 	to	the	state	of	amazonas	,	which	 produce 	 s 	 	that	 rain 	 fall 	 	?
and	the	answer	is	zilch	,	 exact 	 ly 	 	zero	.
that	's	the	economic	 in 	 vis 	 ibility 	 	of	nature	.
that	ca	n't	keep	going	on	,	 be 	 cause 	 	economic	 incentive 	 s 	 	and	 dis 	 incentive 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	.
 economic 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	the	 curr 	 ency 	 	of	policy	.
and	 un 	 less 	 	we	address	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 vis 	 ibility 	 	,	we	are	going	to	get	the	 result 	 s 	 	that	we	are	 see 	 ing 	 	,	which	is	a	 gradu 	 al 	 	degradation	and	loss	of	 th 	 is 	 	 valu 	 able 	 	natural	asset	.
it	's	not	just	about	the	amazonas	,	or	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	about	 rain 	 forest 	 s 	 	.
no	matter	what	level	you	look	at	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	at	the	 eco 	 system 	 	level	or	at	the	species	level	or	at	the	genetic	level	,	we	see	the	same	problem	 aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	.
so	 rain 	 fall 	 	cycle	and	water	 regulat 	 ion 	 	by	 rain 	 forest 	 s 	 	at	an	 eco 	 system 	 	level	.
at	the	species	level	,	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 estimate 	 d 	 	that	insect	-	based	 pollinat 	 ion 	 	,	bees	 pollinat 	 ing 	 	fruit	and	so	on	,	is	 some 	 thing 	 	like	190	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	-	worth	.
that	's	 some 	 thing 	 	like	eight	percent	of	the	total	 agricultur 	 al 	 	 out 	 put 	 	 global 	 ly 	 	.
it	 complete 	 ly 	 	 pass 	 es 	 	 be 	 low 	 	the	radar	screen	.
but	when	did	a	bee	 actual 	 ly 	 	ever	give	you	an	 in 	 voice 	 	?
or	for	that	matter	,	if	you	look	at	the	genetic	level	,	60	percent	of	 medicine 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 prospect 	 ed 	 	,	 we 	 re 	 	found	first	 a 	 s 	 	 molecule 	 s 	 	in	a	 rain 	 forest 	 	or	a	reef	.
once	 aga 	 in 	 	,	most	of	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	get	paid	.
and	that	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	me	to	 an 	 other 	 	 a 	 spect 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	which	is	,	to	whom	should	 th 	 is 	 	get	paid	?
that	genetic	material	 prob 	 ably 	 	 belong 	 ed 	 	,	if	it	could	belong	to	 any 	 one 	 	,	to	a	local	community	of	poor	people	who	 part 	 ed 	 	with	the	knowledge	that	 help 	 ed 	 	the	 research 	 ers 	 	to	find	the	molecule	,	which	then	 be 	 came 	 	the	medicine	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	did	n't	get	paid	.
and	if	you	look	at	the	species	level	,	you	saw	about	fish	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	the	 deple 	 tion 	 	of	ocean	 fish 	 eries 	 	is	so	significant	that	 effective 	 ly 	 	it	is	 effect 	 ing 	 	the	ability	of	the	poor	,	the	 artisan 	 al 	 	 fish 	 er 	 	folk	and	 t 	 hose 	 	who	fish	for	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 livelihood 	 s 	 	,	to	feed	 the 	 ir 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	.
 some 	 thing 	 	like	a	billion	people	depend	on	fish	,	the	 quant 	 ity 	 	of	fish	in	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	.
a	billion	people	depend	on	fish	for	 the 	 ir 	 	main	source	for	animal	protein	.
and	at	 th 	 is 	 	rate	at	which	we	are	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	fish	,	it	is	a	human	problem	of	enormous	 dimension 	 s 	 	,	a	health	problem	of	a	kind	we	have	n't	 s 	 een 	 	before	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	at	the	 eco 	 system 	 	level	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	flood	 prevent 	 ion 	 	or	drought	control	 provide 	 d 	 	by	the	 forest 	 s 	 	,	or	 whet 	 her 	 	it	is	the	ability	of	poor	 farm 	 ers 	 	to	go	out	and	gather	leaf	litter	for	 the 	 ir 	 	cattle	and	 goat 	 s 	 	,	or	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	the	ability	of	 the 	 ir 	 	wives	to	go	and	collect	fuel	wood	from	the	forest	,	it	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	poor	who	depend	most	on	these	 eco 	 system 	 	 service 	 s 	 	.
we	did	 estimate 	 s 	 	in	our	 stud 	 y 	 	that	for	 count 	 ries 	 	like	brazil	,	india	and	indonesia	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	 eco 	 system 	 	 service 	 s 	 	--	these	 benefit 	 s 	 	that	flow	from	nature	to	 human 	 ity 	 	for	free	--	they	're	not	 ver 	 y 	 	big	in	 percent 	 age 	 	 term 	 s 	 	of	gdp	--	two	,	four	,	eight	,	10	,	15	percent	--	but	in	these	 count 	 ries 	 	,	if	we	measure	how	much	they	're	worth	to	the	poor	,	the	 answer 	 s 	 	are	more	like	45	percent	,	75	percent	,	90	percent	.
that	's	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	these	are	 import 	 ant 	 	 benefit 	 s 	 	for	the	poor	.
and	you	ca	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	have	a	proper	model	for	 develop 	 ment 	 	if	at	the	same	time	you	're	 destroy 	 ing 	 	or	 allow 	 ing 	 	the	degradation	of	the	 ver 	 y 	 	asset	,	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	asset	,	which	is	your	 develop 	 ment 	 	asset	,	that	is	 eco 	 logical 	 	 infra 	 structure 	 	.
how	bad	can	 thing 	 s 	 	get	?
well	here	a	picture	of	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	mean	species	abundance	.
it	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	a	measure	of	how	 man 	 y 	 	 tiger 	 s 	 	,	 to 	 ad 	 s 	 	,	 tick 	 s 	 	or	 what 	 ever 	 	on	average	of	 bio 	 mass 	 	of	 vari 	 ous 	 	species	are	around	.
the	green	 represent 	 s 	 	the	 percent 	 age 	 	.
if	you	start	green	,	it	's	like	80	to	100	percent	.
if	it	's	yellow	,	it	's	40	to	60	percent	.
and	these	are	 percent 	 age 	 s 	 	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	the	original	state	,	so	to	speak	,	the	pre	-	industrial	era	,	1750	.
now	i	'm	going	to	show	you	how	business	 a 	 s 	 	usual	will	affect	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	just	watch	the	change	in	 color 	 s 	 	in	india	,	 chin 	 a 	 	,	europe	,	sub	-	saharan	africa	 a 	 s 	 	we	move	on	and	 consum 	 e 	 	global	 bio 	 mass 	 	at	a	rate	which	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	not	going	to	be	able	to	sustain	us	.
see	that	 aga 	 in 	 	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	 place 	 s 	 	that	remain	green	--	and	that	's	not	good	news	--	is	,	in	fact	,	 place 	 s 	 	like	the	gobi	desert	,	like	the	 t 	 un 	 dra 	 	and	like	the	sahara	.
but	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	help	 be 	 cause 	 	there	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	few	species	and	volume	of	 bio 	 mass 	 	there	in	the	first	place	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	.
the	reason	 th 	 is 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	 boil 	 s 	 	down	,	in	my	mind	,	to	one	 bas 	 ic 	 	problem	,	which	is	our	 in 	 ability 	 	to	perceive	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	public	 benefit 	 s 	 	and	private	 profit 	 s 	 	.
we	tend	to	 constant 	 ly 	 	 ignor 	 e 	 	public	wealth	 simpl 	 y 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	in	the	common	wealth	,	it	's	common	 good 	 s 	 	.
and	here	's	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	from	thailand	where	we	found	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	value	of	a	 man 	 grove 	 	is	not	that	much	--	it	's	about	$	600	over	the	life	of	nine	 year 	 s 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 measur 	 ed 	 	--	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	 it 	 s 	 	value	 a 	 s 	 	a	shrimp	farm	,	which	is	more	like	$	9,600	,	there	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	 gradu 	 al 	 	trend	to	deplete	the	 man 	 grove 	 s 	 	and	convert	them	to	shrimp	 farm 	 s 	 	.
but	of	course	,	if	you	look	at	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	 t 	 hose 	 	 profit 	 s 	 	are	,	 al 	 most 	 	8,000	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 dollar 	 s 	 	are	,	in	fact	,	 sub 	 sid 	 ies 	 	.
so	you	 compar 	 e 	 	the	two	 side 	 s 	 	of	the	 co 	 in 	 	and	you	find	that	it	's	more	like	1,200	to	600	.
that	's	not	that	hard	.
but	on	the	other	hand	,	if	you	start	 measur 	 ing 	 	,	how	much	would	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	cost	to	 re 	 store 	 	the	land	of	the	shrimp	farm	back	to	productive	use	?
once	salt	 de 	 position 	 	and	chemical	 de 	 position 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	had	 it 	 s 	 	 effect 	 s 	 	,	that	answer	is	more	like	$	12,000	of	cost	.
and	if	you	see	the	 benefit 	 s 	 	of	the	 man 	 grove 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	storm	 protect 	 ion 	 	and	 cycl 	 one 	 	 protect 	 ion 	 	that	you	get	and	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	 fish 	 eries 	 	,	the	fish	 nurse 	 ries 	 	,	that	provide	fish	for	the	poor	,	that	answer	is	more	like	$	11,000	.
so	now	look	at	the	different	lens	.
if	you	look	at	the	lens	of	public	wealth	 a 	 s 	 	against	the	lens	of	private	 profit 	 s 	 	,	you	get	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	answer	,	which	is	 clear 	 ly 	 	 conserv 	 ation 	 	 make 	 s 	 	more	sense	,	and	not	 destruct 	 ion 	 	.
so	is	 th 	 is 	 	just	a	story	from	south	thailand	?
sorry	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	global	story	.
and	here	's	what	the	same	 calcul 	 ation 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	,	which	was	 d 	 one 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	--	well	i	say	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	over	the	last	10	 year 	 s 	 	--	by	a	group	 call 	 ed 	 	trucost	.
and	they	 calcul 	 ated 	 	for	the	top	3,000	 corporation 	 s 	 	,	what	are	the	 external 	 ities 	 	?
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	what	are	the	 cost 	 s 	 	of	 do 	 ing 	 	business	 a 	 s 	 	usual	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 il 	 legal 	 	stuff	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	business	 a 	 s 	 	usual	,	which	 cause 	 s 	 	climate	-	changing	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	,	which	have	an	economic	cost	.	it	 cause 	 s 	 	 pollutant 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 issue 	 d 	 	,	which	have	an	economic	cost	,	health	cost	and	so	on	.
use	of	 fresh 	 water 	 	.
if	you	drill	water	to	make	 co 	 ke 	 	near	a	village	farm	,	that	's	not	 il 	 legal 	 	,	but	 y 	 es 	 	,	it	 cost 	 s 	 	the	community	.
can	we	stop	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	how	?
i	think	the	first	point	to	make	is	that	we	need	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	natural	capital	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	the	stuff	of	life	is	natural	capital	,	and	we	need	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	and	build	that	 in 	 to 	 	our	 system 	 s 	 	.
when	we	measure	gdp	 a 	 s 	 	a	measure	of	economic	performance	at	the	national	level	,	we	do	n't	include	our	 big 	 gest 	 	asset	at	the	country	level	.
when	we	measure	corporate	 performance 	 s 	 	,	we	do	n't	include	our	 impact 	 s 	 	on	nature	and	what	our	business	 cost 	 s 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
that	 ha 	 s 	 	to	stop	.
in	fact	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	what	 re 	 ally 	 	inspired	my	interest	in	 th 	 is 	 	phase	.
i	 beg 	 an 	 	a	project	way	back	 call 	 ed 	 	the	green	 account 	 ing 	 	project	.
that	was	in	the	early	2000s	when	india	was	going	gung	-	ho	about	gdp	growth	 a 	 s 	 	the	 mean 	 s 	 	forward	--	looking	at	 chin 	 a 	 	with	 it 	 s 	 	stellar	 growth 	 s 	 	of	eight	,	nine	,	10	percent	and	 wonder 	 ing 	 	,	why	can	we	do	the	same	?
and	a	few	 friend 	 s 	 	of	mine	and	i	 decide 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	sense	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	create	more	cost	to	 socie 	 ty 	 	and	more	 loss 	 es 	 	.
so	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	do	a	massive	set	of	 calcul 	 ations 	 	and	 start 	 ed 	 	producing	green	 account 	 s 	 	for	india	and	 it 	 s 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
that	's	how	my	 interest 	 s 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	and	went	to	the	teeb	project	.
 calcul 	 ating 	 	 th 	 is 	 	at	the	national	level	is	one	thing	,	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 beg 	 un 	 	.
and	the	world	bank	 ha 	 s 	 	 acknowledg 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	and	they	've	 start 	 ed 	 	a	project	 call 	 ed 	 	 wave 	 s 	 	--	wealth	 account 	 ing 	 	and	 valu 	 ation 	 	of	 eco 	 system 	 	 service 	 s 	 	.
but	 calcul 	 ating 	 	 th 	 is 	 	at	the	next	level	,	that	 mean 	 s 	 	at	the	business	sector	level	,	is	 import 	 ant 	 	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	with	the	teeb	project	.
we	've	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	for	a	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	case	,	which	was	for	 de 	 forest 	 ation 	 	in	 chin 	 a 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 import 	 ant 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	in	 chin 	 a 	 	in	1997	,	the	yellow	river	 actual 	 ly 	 	went	dry	for	nine	 month 	 s 	 	 caus 	 ing 	 	severe	loss	of	 agricultur 	 e 	 	 out 	 put 	 	and	pain	and	loss	to	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
just	a	year	 lat 	 er 	 	the	yangtze	 flood 	 ed 	 	,	 caus 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	5,500	 death 	 s 	 	.
so	 clear 	 ly 	 	there	was	a	problem	with	 de 	 forest 	 ation 	 	.
it	was	 associate 	 d 	 	 large 	 ly 	 	with	the	construction	industry	.
and	the	chinese	government	 respond 	 ed 	 	 sens 	 ibly 	 	and	 place 	 d 	 	a	ban	on	 fell 	 ing 	 	.
a	 retrospect 	 ive 	 	on	40	 year 	 s 	 	 show 	 s 	 	that	if	we	had	 account 	 ed 	 	for	these	 cost 	 s 	 	--	the	cost	of	loss	of	 top 	 s 	 oil 	 	,	the	cost	of	loss	of	 water 	 ways 	 	,	the	lost	 product 	 ivity 	 	,	the	loss	to	local	 commun 	 ities 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	all	these	 factor 	 s 	 	,	 desert 	 ification 	 	and	so	on	--	 t 	 hose 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 most 	 	twice	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	the	market	price	of	timber	.
so	in	fact	,	the	price	of	timber	in	the	beijing	 market 	 place 	 	ought	to	have	 be 	 en 	 	three	-	 time 	 s 	 	what	it	was	had	it	 reflect 	 ed 	 	the	true	pain	and	the	 cost 	 s 	 	to	the	 socie 	 ty 	 	 with 	 in 	 	 chin 	 a 	 	.
of	course	,	after	the	event	one	can	be	wise	.
the	way	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	is	to	do	it	on	a	company	 bas 	 is 	 	,	to	take	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	forward	,	and	to	do	it	for	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 sector 	 s 	 	which	have	a	cost	,	and	to	 dis 	 close 	 	these	 answer 	 s 	 	.
 some 	 one 	 	once	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	,	``	who	is	better	or	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	is	it	unilever	or	is	it	p	&	g	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	impact	on	 rain 	 forest 	 s 	 	in	indonesia	?	``	and	i	could	n't	answer	 be 	 cause 	 	 n 	 either 	 	of	these	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	,	good	 th 	 ough 	 	they	are	and	professional	 th 	 ough 	 	they	are	,	do	not	 calcul 	 ate 	 	or	 dis 	 close 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 external 	 ities 	 	.
but	if	we	look	at	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	like	puma	--	jochen	zeitz	,	 the 	 ir 	 	ceo	and	 chair 	 man 	 	,	once	 challeng 	 ed 	 	me	at	a	function	,	 say 	 ing 	 	that	he	's	going	to	implement	my	project	before	i	finish	it	.
well	i	think	we	kind	of	did	it	at	the	same	time	,	but	he	's	 d 	 one 	 	it	.
he	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	the	cost	to	puma	.
puma	 ha 	 s 	 	2.7	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	of	 turn 	 over 	 	,	300	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	of	 profit 	 s 	 	,	200	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	after	tax	,	94	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	of	 external 	 ities 	 	,	cost	to	business	.
now	that	's	not	a	happy	 situ 	 ation 	 	for	them	,	but	they	have	the	confidence	and	the	courage	to	come	forward	and	say	,	``	here	's	what	we	are	 measur 	 ing 	 	.
we	are	 measur 	 ing 	 	it	 be 	 cause 	 	we	know	that	you	can	not	manage	what	you	do	not	measure	.	``	that	's	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	i	think	,	for	us	to	look	at	and	for	us	to	draw	comfort	from	.
if	more	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	did	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	if	more	 sector 	 s 	 	 engag 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 sector 	 s 	 	,	you	could	have	 analyst 	 s 	 	,	business	 analyst 	 s 	 	,	and	you	could	have	people	like	us	and	 consumer 	 s 	 	and	ngos	 actual 	 ly 	 	look	and	 compar 	 e 	 	the	social	performance	of	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	we	ca	n't	yet	do	that	,	but	i	think	the	path	is	laid	out	.
 th 	 is 	 	can	be	 d 	 one 	 	.
and	i	'm	 de 	 light 	 ed 	 	that	the	institute	of	 chart 	 er 	 ed 	 	 account 	 ants 	 	in	the	u.k.	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	set	up	a	 coal 	 ition 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	an	 inter 	 national 	 	 coal 	 ition 	 	.
the	other	 favor 	 ite 	 	,	if	you	like	,	solution	for	me	is	the	creation	of	green	carbon	 market 	 s 	 	.
and	by	the	way	,	these	are	my	 favor 	 ites 	 	--	 external 	 ities 	 	 calcul 	 ation 	 	and	green	carbon	 market 	 s 	 	.
teeb	 ha 	 s 	 	more	than	a	dozen	 separat 	 e 	 	 group 	 s 	 	of	 solution 	 s 	 	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 protect 	 ed 	 	area	 evalu 	 ation 	 	and	 payment 	 s 	 	for	 eco 	 system 	 	 service 	 s 	 	and	eco	-	 cert 	 ification 	 	and	you	name	it	,	but	these	are	the	 favor 	 ites 	 	.
what	's	green	carbon	?
 to 	 day 	 	what	we	have	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	a	 brow 	 n 	 	carbon	 market 	 place 	 	.
it	's	about	energy	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	.
the	european	 un 	 ion 	 	ets	is	the	main	 market 	 place 	 	.
it	's	not	 do 	 ing 	 	too	well	.	we	've	over	-	 issue 	 d 	 	.
a	bit	like	 infla 	 tion 	 	:	you	over	-	issue	 curr 	 ency 	 	,	you	get	what	you	see	,	 dec 	 lining 	 	 price 	 s 	 	.
but	that	's	all	about	energy	and	industry	.
but	what	we	're	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	some	other	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	like	black	carbon	,	that	is	soot	.
what	we	're	 al 	 so 	 	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	is	blue	carbon	,	which	,	by	the	way	,	is	the	largest	store	of	carbon	--	more	than	55	percent	.
 thank 	 fully 	 	,	the	flux	,	in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	the	flow	of	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	from	the	ocean	to	the	atmosphere	and	vice	versa	,	is	more	or	less	 balanc 	 ed 	 	.
in	fact	,	what	's	 be 	 ing 	 	 absorb 	 ed 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	like	25	percent	of	our	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	,	which	then	 lead 	 s 	 	to	 acid 	 ification 	 	or	lower	 al 	 ka 	 lin 	 ity 	 	in	 ocean 	 s 	 	.
more	of	that	in	a	minute	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	there	's	 de 	 forest 	 ation 	 	,	and	there	's	 e 	 mission 	 	of	 m 	 ethane 	 	from	 agricultur 	 e 	 	.
green	carbon	,	which	is	the	 de 	 forest 	 ation 	 	and	 agricultur 	 al 	 	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	,	and	blue	carbon	together	 com 	 prise 	 	25	percent	of	our	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	.
we	have	the	 mean 	 s 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	in	our	 hand 	 s 	 	,	through	a	structure	,	through	a	 mechan 	 ism 	 	,	 call 	 ed 	 	redd	plus	--	a	scheme	for	the	 reduc 	 ed 	 	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	from	 de 	 forest 	 ation 	 	and	forest	degradation	.
and	 al 	 ready 	 	norway	 ha 	 s 	 	 con 	 tribute 	 d 	 	a	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	each	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	indonesia	and	brazil	to	implement	 th 	 is 	 	red	plus	scheme	.
so	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	some	 move 	 ment 	 	forward	.
but	the	thing	is	to	do	a	lot	more	of	that	.
will	 th 	 is 	 	solve	the	problem	?	will	 economic 	 s 	 	solve	 every 	 thing 	 	?
well	i	'm	 af 	 raid 	 	not	.
there	is	an	area	that	is	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	,	coral	 reef 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	they	cut	 a 	 cross 	 	the	entire	 glob 	 e 	 	all	the	way	from	micronesia	 a 	 cross 	 	indonesia	,	malaysia	,	india	,	madagascar	and	to	the	west	of	the	caribbean	.
these	red	 dot 	 s 	 	,	these	red	 area 	 s 	 	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	provide	the	food	and	livelihood	for	more	than	half	a	billion	people	.
so	that	's	 al 	 most 	 	an	eighth	of	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
and	the	 s 	 ad 	 	thing	is	that	,	 a 	 s 	 	these	coral	 reef 	 s 	 	are	lost	--	and	 scientist 	 s 	 	tell	us	that	any	level	of	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	in	the	atmosphere	above	350	 part 	 s 	 	per	million	is	too	 danger 	 ous 	 	for	the	 surviv 	 al 	 	of	these	 reef 	 s 	 	--	we	are	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 risk 	 ing 	 	the	 extinct 	 ion 	 	of	the	entire	coral	species	,	the	warm	water	 coral 	 s 	 	,	we	're	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 risk 	 ing 	 	a	fourth	of	all	fish	species	which	are	in	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	,	but	we	are	 risk 	 ing 	 	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 live 	 s 	 	and	 livelihood 	 s 	 	of	more	than	500	million	people	who	live	in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	in	poor	 count 	 ries 	 	.
so	in	 select 	 ing 	 	 target 	 s 	 	of	450	 part 	 s 	 	per	million	and	 select 	 ing 	 	two	 degree 	 s 	 	at	the	climate	 negoti 	 ations 	 	,	what	we	have	 d 	 one 	 	is	we	've	made	an	 ethic 	 al 	 	choice	.
we	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	kind	of	made	an	 ethic 	 al 	 	choice	in	 socie 	 ty 	 	to	not	have	coral	 reef 	 s 	 	.
well	what	i	will	say	to	you	in	 part 	 ing 	 	is	that	we	may	have	 d 	 one 	 	that	.
let	's	think	about	it	and	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	,	but	 pleas 	 e 	 	,	let	's	not	do	more	of	that	.
 be 	 cause 	 	mother	nature	 on 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	that	much	in	 eco 	 logical 	 	 infra 	 structure 	 	and	that	much	natural	capital	.
i	do	n't	think	we	can	afford	too	much	of	 s 	 uch 	 	 ethic 	 al 	 	 choice 	 s 	 	.
thank	you	.
