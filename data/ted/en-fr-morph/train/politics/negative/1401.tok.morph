the	 electric 	 ity 	 	 power 	 ing 	 	the	 light 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	theater	was	generated	just	 moment 	 s 	 	ago	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	way	 thing 	 s 	 	stand	 to 	 day 	 	,	 electric 	 ity 	 	demand	must	be	in	constant	balance	with	 electric 	 ity 	 	supply	.
if	in	the	time	that	it	took	me	to	walk	out	here	on	 th 	 is 	 	stage	,	some	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 megawatt 	 s 	 	of	wind	power	 stop 	 ped 	 	 pour 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	grid	,	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	would	have	to	be	made	up	from	other	 gene 	 rator 	 s 	 	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	.
but	coal	 plant 	 s 	 	,	nuclear	 plant 	 s 	 	ca	n't	respond	fast	 en 	 ough 	 	.
a	giant	 batt 	 ery 	 	could	.
with	a	giant	 batt 	 ery 	 	,	we	'd	be	able	to	address	the	problem	of	intermittency	that	 prevent 	 s 	 	wind	and	solar	from	 con 	 trib 	 uting 	 	to	the	grid	in	the	same	way	that	coal	,	gas	and	nuclear	do	 to 	 day 	 	.
you	see	,	the	 batt 	 ery 	 	is	the	key	 enabl 	 ing 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	here	.
with	it	,	we	could	draw	 electric 	 ity 	 	from	the	 s 	 un 	 	even	when	the	 s 	 un 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	shine	.
and	that	 change 	 s 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	then	 renew 	 able 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	wind	and	solar	come	out	from	the	 wing 	 s 	 	,	here	to	center	stage	.
 to 	 day 	 	i	want	to	tell	you	about	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 de 	 vice 	 	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	liquid	metal	 batt 	 ery 	 	.
it	's	a	new	form	of	energy	 s 	 to 	 rage 	 	that	i	 invent 	 ed 	 	at	mit	 a 	 long 	 	with	a	team	of	my	 student 	 s 	 	and	post	-	 doc 	 s 	 	.
now	the	theme	of	 th 	 is 	 	year	's	ted	 con 	 ference 	 	is	full	spectrum	.
the	oed	 define 	 s 	 	spectrum	 a 	 s 	 	``	the	entire	range	of	 wave 	 length 	 s 	 	of	 electro 	 magnet 	 ic 	 	 radi 	 ation 	 	,	from	the	 long 	 est 	 	radio	 wave 	 s 	 	to	the	 short 	 est 	 	 gam 	 ma 	 	 ray 	 s 	 	of	which	the	range	of	visible	light	is	 on 	 ly 	 	a	small	part	.	``	so	i	'm	not	here	 to 	 day 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	to	tell	you	how	my	team	at	mit	 ha 	 s 	 	drawn	out	of	nature	a	solution	to	one	of	the	world	's	great	 problem 	 s 	 	.
i	want	to	go	full	spectrum	and	tell	you	how	,	in	the	process	of	 develop 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	new	technology	,	we	've	 un 	 cover 	 ed 	 	some	surprising	heterodoxies	that	can	serve	 a 	 s 	 	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	for	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	 idea 	 s 	 	worth	 spread 	 ing 	 	.
and	you	know	,	if	we	're	going	to	get	 th 	 is 	 	country	out	of	 it 	 s 	 	current	energy	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	we	ca	n't	just	 conserv 	 e 	 	our	way	out	;	we	ca	n't	just	drill	our	way	out	;	we	ca	n't	bomb	our	way	out	.
we	're	going	to	do	it	the	old	-	 fashion 	 ed 	 	american	way	,	we	're	going	to	invent	our	way	out	,	 work 	 ing 	 	together	.
now	let	's	get	 start 	 ed 	 	.
the	 batt 	 ery 	 	was	 invent 	 ed 	 	about	200	 year 	 s 	 	ago	by	a	professor	,	alessandro	volta	,	at	the	university	of	padua	in	italy	.
his	 invent 	 ion 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	birth	to	a	new	field	of	science	,	electrochemistry	,	and	new	 techno 	 logies 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	electroplating	.
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 overlook 	 ed 	 	,	volta	's	 invent 	 ion 	 	of	the	 batt 	 ery 	 	for	the	first	time	 al 	 so 	 	 demonst 	 rated 	 	the	 util 	 ity 	 	of	a	professor	.
 un 	 til 	 	volta	,	 no 	 body 	 	could	imagine	a	professor	could	be	of	any	use	.
here	's	the	first	 batt 	 ery 	 	--	a	stack	of	 co 	 in 	 s 	 	,	 z 	 inc 	 	and	silver	,	 separat 	 ed 	 	by	 card 	 board 	 	 soak 	 ed 	 	in	 br 	 ine 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 start 	 ing 	 	point	for	 design 	 ing 	 	a	 batt 	 ery 	 	--	two	 electro 	 de 	 s 	 	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	 metal 	 s 	 	of	different	 com 	 position 	 	,	and	an	electrolyte	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	salt	 dis 	 solve 	 d 	 	in	water	.
the	science	is	that	simple	.
 admitted 	 ly 	 	,	i	've	left	out	a	few	 detail 	 s 	 	.
now	i	've	taught	you	that	 batt 	 ery 	 	science	is	 straight 	 forward 	 	and	the	need	for	grid	-	level	 s 	 to 	 rage 	 	is	 compel 	 ling 	 	,	but	the	fact	is	that	 to 	 day 	 	there	is	 simpl 	 y 	 	no	 batt 	 ery 	 	technology	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 meet 	 ing 	 	the	 demand 	 ing 	 	performance	 requir 	 ement 	 s 	 	of	the	grid	--	 name 	 ly 	 	uncommonly	high	power	,	long	service	 life 	 time 	 	and	super	-	low	cost	.
we	need	to	think	about	the	problem	 different 	 ly 	 	.
we	need	to	think	big	,	we	need	to	think	cheap	.
so	let	's	abandon	the	paradigm	of	let	's	search	for	the	 cool 	 est 	 	 chemist 	 ry 	 	and	then	 hope 	 fully 	 	we	'll	chase	down	the	cost	 curv 	 e 	 	by	just	making	 lot 	 s 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	product	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	let	's	invent	to	the	price	point	of	the	 electric 	 ity 	 	market	.
so	that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	certain	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	 period 	 ic 	 	table	are	axiomatically	off	-	 limit 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 batt 	 ery 	 	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	made	out	of	earth	-	abundant	 element 	 s 	 	.
i	say	,	if	you	want	to	make	 some 	 thing 	 	dirt	cheap	,	make	it	out	of	dirt	--	 prefer 	 ably 	 	dirt	that	's	 local 	 ly 	 	sourced	.
and	we	need	to	be	able	to	build	 th 	 is 	 	thing	using	simple	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	and	 factor 	 ies 	 	that	do	n't	cost	us	a	fortune	.
so	about	six	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	problem	.
and	in	order	to	adopt	a	fresh	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	i	 s 	 ought 	 	inspiration	from	beyond	the	field	of	 electric 	 ity 	 	 s 	 to 	 rage 	 	.
in	fact	,	i	 look 	 ed 	 	to	a	technology	that	 n 	 either 	 	 store 	 s 	 	nor	 generate 	 s 	 	 electric 	 ity 	 	,	but	 in 	 stead 	 	 consum 	 es 	 	 electric 	 ity 	 	,	huge	 amount 	 s 	 	of	it	.
i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	production	of	 a 	 lumin 	 um 	 	.
the	process	was	 invent 	 ed 	 	in	1886	by	a	couple	of	22	-	year	-	olds	--	hall	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	and	heroult	in	france	.
and	just	a	few	short	 year 	 s 	 	 follow 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 discover 	 y 	 	,	 a 	 lumin 	 um 	 	 change 	 d 	 	from	a	precious	metal	 cost 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	silver	to	a	common	structural	material	.
you	're	looking	at	the	cell	house	of	a	modern	 a 	 lumin 	 um 	 	smelter	.
it	's	about	50	feet	wide	and	 reced 	 es 	 	about	half	a	mile	--	row	after	row	of	 cell 	 s 	 	that	,	 in 	 side 	 	,	resemble	volta	's	 batt 	 ery 	 	,	with	three	 import 	 ant 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	.
volta	's	 batt 	 ery 	 	 work 	 s 	 	at	room	temperature	.
it	's	fitted	with	solid	 electro 	 de 	 s 	 	and	an	electrolyte	that	's	a	solution	of	salt	and	water	.
the	hall	-	heroult	cell	 oper 	 ates 	 	at	high	temperature	,	a	temperature	high	 en 	 ough 	 	that	the	 a 	 lumin 	 um 	 	metal	product	is	liquid	.
the	electrolyte	is	not	a	solution	of	salt	and	water	,	but	 ra 	 ther 	 	salt	that	's	 melt 	 ed 	 	.
it	's	 th 	 is 	 	combination	of	liquid	metal	,	molten	salt	and	high	temperature	that	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	 s 	 end 	 	high	current	through	 th 	 is 	 	thing	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	we	can	produce	virgin	metal	from	ore	at	a	cost	of	less	than	50	 cent 	 s 	 	a	pound	.
that	's	the	economic	miracle	of	modern	electrometallurgy	.
it	is	 th 	 is 	 	that	caught	and	held	my	attention	to	the	point	that	i	 be 	 came 	 	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	 invent 	 ing 	 	a	 batt 	 ery 	 	that	could	capture	 th 	 is 	 	 gig 	 antic 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	of	scale	.
and	i	did	.
i	made	the	 batt 	 ery 	 	all	liquid	--	liquid	 metal 	 s 	 	for	both	 electro 	 de 	 s 	 	and	a	molten	salt	for	the	electrolyte	.
i	'll	show	you	how	.
so	i	put	low	-	density	liquid	metal	at	the	top	,	put	a	high	-	density	liquid	metal	at	the	bottom	,	and	molten	salt	in	between	.
so	now	,	how	to	 choos 	 e 	 	the	 metal 	 s 	 	?
for	me	,	the	design	 exercis 	 e 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 begin 	 s 	 	here	with	the	 period 	 ic 	 	table	,	enunciated	by	 an 	 other 	 	professor	,	dimitri	mendeleyev	.
 every 	 thing 	 	we	know	is	made	of	some	combination	of	what	you	see	 depict 	 ed 	 	here	.
and	that	 include 	 s 	 	our	own	bodies	.
i	recall	the	 ver 	 y 	 	moment	one	day	when	i	was	 search 	 ing 	 	for	a	pair	of	 metal 	 s 	 	that	would	meet	the	 constraint 	 s 	 	of	earth	abundance	,	different	,	 oppos 	 ite 	 	density	and	high	mutual	reactivity	.
i	felt	the	thrill	of	 real 	 ization 	 	when	i	 k 	 new 	 	i	'd	come	 up 	 on 	 	the	answer	.
 magn 	 es 	 ium 	 	for	the	top	layer	.
and	 anti 	 mon 	 y 	 	for	the	bottom	layer	.
you	know	,	i	've	got	to	tell	you	,	one	of	the	 great 	 est 	 	 benefit 	 s 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	a	professor	:	 color 	 ed 	 	chalk	.
so	to	produce	current	,	 magn 	 es 	 ium 	 	 lose 	 s 	 	two	 electron 	 s 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	 magn 	 es 	 ium 	 	ion	,	which	then	migrates	 a 	 cross 	 	the	electrolyte	,	 accept 	 s 	 	two	 electron 	 s 	 	from	the	 anti 	 mon 	 y 	 	,	and	then	 mix 	 es 	 	with	it	to	form	an	alloy	.
the	 electron 	 s 	 	go	to	work	in	the	real	world	out	here	,	 power 	 ing 	 	our	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	.
now	to	charge	the	 batt 	 ery 	 	,	we	connect	a	source	of	 electric 	 ity 	 	.
it	could	be	 some 	 thing 	 	like	a	wind	farm	.
and	then	we	reverse	the	current	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 force 	 s 	 	 magn 	 es 	 ium 	 	to	de	-	alloy	and	return	to	the	upper	 electro 	 de 	 	,	 re 	 storing 	 	the	 initi 	 al 	 	 constit 	 ution 	 	of	the	 batt 	 ery 	 	.
and	the	current	 pass 	 ing 	 	between	the	 electro 	 de 	 s 	 	 generate 	 s 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	heat	to	keep	it	at	temperature	.
it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	cool	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	in	 theor 	 y 	 	.
but	 do 	 es 	 	it	 re 	 ally 	 	work	?
so	what	to	do	next	?
we	go	to	the	 labor 	 atory 	 	.
now	do	i	hire	seasoned	 professional 	 s 	 	?
no	,	i	hire	a	student	and	mentor	him	,	teach	him	how	to	think	about	the	problem	,	to	see	it	from	my	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	and	then	turn	him	loose	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	that	student	,	david	bradwell	,	who	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	image	,	 appear 	 s 	 	to	be	 wonder 	 ing 	 	if	 th 	 is 	 	thing	will	ever	work	.
what	i	did	n't	tell	david	at	the	time	was	i	 my 	 self 	 	was	n't	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	it	would	work	.
but	david	's	young	and	he	's	smart	and	he	 want 	 s 	 	a	ph.d.	,	and	he	 proceed 	 s 	 	to	build	--	he	 proceed 	 s 	 	to	build	the	first	ever	liquid	metal	 batt 	 ery 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 chemist 	 ry 	 	.
and	based	on	david	's	 initi 	 al 	 	promising	 result 	 s 	 	,	which	 we 	 re 	 	paid	with	seed	 fund 	 s 	 	at	mit	,	i	was	able	to	attract	major	research	 fund 	 ing 	 	from	the	private	sector	and	the	federal	government	.
and	that	 allow 	 ed 	 	me	to	expand	my	group	to	20	people	,	a	mix	of	graduate	 student 	 s 	 	,	post	-	 doc 	 s 	 	and	even	some	 under 	 graduate 	 s 	 	.
and	i	was	able	to	attract	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	good	people	,	people	who	share	my	 pass 	 ion 	 	for	science	and	service	to	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	not	science	and	service	for	 care 	 er 	 	building	.
and	if	you	ask	these	people	why	they	work	on	liquid	metal	 batt 	 ery 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	answer	would	hearken	back	to	 p 	 resident 	 	kennedy	's	 remark 	 s 	 	at	rice	university	in	1962	when	he	 s 	 aid 	 	--	and	i	'm	taking	 liber 	 ties 	 	here	--	``	we	 choos 	 e 	 	to	work	on	grid	-	level	 s 	 to 	 rage 	 	,	not	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	easy	,	but	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	hard	.	``	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	evolution	of	the	liquid	metal	 batt 	 ery 	 	.
we	start	here	with	our	workhorse	one	watt	-	hour	cell	.
i	 call 	 ed 	 	it	the	shotglass	.
we	've	 oper 	 ated 	 	over	400	of	these	,	 perfect 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	performance	with	a	 plural 	 ity 	 	of	 chemist 	 ries 	 	--	not	just	 magn 	 es 	 ium 	 	and	 anti 	 mon 	 y 	 	.
 a 	 long 	 	the	way	we	 scale 	 d 	 	up	to	the	20	watt	-	hour	cell	.
i	call	it	the	 hoc 	 key 	 	puck	.
and	we	got	the	same	 remark 	 able 	 	 result 	 s 	 	.
and	then	it	was	onto	the	saucer	.
that	's	200	watt	-	 hour 	 s 	 	.
the	technology	was	 prov 	 ing 	 	 it 	 self 	 	to	be	 ro 	 bust 	 	and	 scal 	 able 	 	.
but	the	pace	was	n't	fast	 en 	 ough 	 	for	us	.
so	a	year	and	a	half	ago	,	david	and	i	,	 a 	 long 	 	with	 an 	 other 	 	research	staff	-	member	,	 form 	 ed 	 	a	company	to	 accele 	 rate 	 	the	rate	of	progress	and	the	race	to	 manufactur 	 e 	 	product	.
so	 to 	 day 	 	at	lmbc	,	we	're	building	 cell 	 s 	 	16	 inch 	 es 	 	in	 dia 	 meter 	 	with	a	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	of	one	kilowatt	-	hour	--	1,000	 time 	 s 	 	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	of	that	 initi 	 al 	 	shotglass	cell	.
we	call	that	the	pizza	.
and	then	we	've	got	a	four	kilowatt	-	hour	cell	on	the	horizon	.
it	's	going	to	be	36	 inch 	 es 	 	in	 dia 	 meter 	 	.
we	call	that	the	bistro	table	,	but	it	's	not	ready	yet	for	prime	-	time	 view 	 ing 	 	.
and	one	 vari 	 ant 	 	of	the	technology	 ha 	 s 	 	us	 stack 	 ing 	 	these	bistro	 table 	 top 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 modul 	 es 	 	,	 aggreg 	 ating 	 	the	 modul 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	giant	 batt 	 ery 	 	that	 fit 	 s 	 	in	a	40	-	foot	 ship 	 ping 	 	 contain 	 er 	 	for	placement	in	the	field	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	nameplate	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	of	two	megawatt	-	 hour 	 s 	 	--	two	million	watt	-	 hour 	 s 	 	.
that	's	 en 	 ough 	 	energy	to	meet	the	 dai 	 ly 	 	 electric 	 al 	 	 need 	 s 	 	of	200	american	 house 	 hold 	 s 	 	.
so	here	you	have	it	,	grid	-	level	 s 	 to 	 rage 	 	:	silent	,	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	-	free	,	no	moving	 part 	 s 	 	,	 remote 	 ly 	 	controlled	,	designed	to	the	market	price	point	 with 	 out 	 	 sub 	 s 	 idy 	 	.
so	what	have	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	all	 th 	 is 	 	?
so	what	have	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	all	 th 	 is 	 	?
let	me	share	with	you	some	of	the	 surprise 	 s 	 	,	the	heterodoxies	.
they	lie	beyond	the	visible	.
temperature	:	 convention 	 al 	 	 wis 	 dom 	 	 say 	 s 	 	set	it	low	,
at	or	near	room	temperature	,	and	then	install	a	control	system	to	keep	it	there	.
avoid	thermal	 run 	 away 	 	.
liquid	metal	 batt 	 ery 	 	is	designed	to	 oper 	 ate 	 	at	 elev 	 ated 	 	temperature	with	 minim 	 um 	 	 regulat 	 ion 	 	.
our	 batt 	 ery 	 	can	handle	the	 ver 	 y 	 	high	temperature	 rise 	 s 	 	that	come	from	current	 s 	 urge 	 s 	 	.
 scal 	 ing 	 	:	 convention 	 al 	 	 wis 	 dom 	 	 say 	 s 	 	 reduc 	 e 	 	cost	by	producing	 man 	 y 	 	.
liquid	metal	 batt 	 ery 	 	is	designed	to	 reduc 	 e 	 	cost	by	producing	 few 	 er 	 	,	but	they	'll	be	 large 	 r 	 	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	human	 resource 	 s 	 	:	 convention 	 al 	 	 wis 	 dom 	 	 say 	 s 	 	hire	 batt 	 ery 	 	 expert 	 s 	 	,	seasoned	 professional 	 s 	 	,	who	can	draw	 up 	 on 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	vast	experience	and	knowledge	.
to	develop	liquid	metal	 batt 	 ery 	 	,	i	 hire 	 d 	 	 student 	 s 	 	and	post	-	 doc 	 s 	 	and	 mentor 	 ed 	 	them	.
in	a	 batt 	 ery 	 	,	i	 striv 	 e 	 	to	 maxim 	 ize 	 	 electric 	 al 	 	potential	;	when	 mentor 	 ing 	 	,	i	 striv 	 e 	 	to	 maxim 	 ize 	 	human	potential	.
so	you	see	,	the	liquid	metal	 batt 	 ery 	 	story	is	more	than	an	account	of	 invent 	 ing 	 	technology	,	it	's	a	 blue 	 print 	 	for	 invent 	 ing 	 	 inventor 	 s 	 	,	full	-	spectrum	.
