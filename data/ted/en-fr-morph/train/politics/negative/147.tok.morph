i	'm	a	medical	 illustr 	 ator 	 	,	and	i	come	from	a	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	different	point	of	view	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	,	since	i	grew	up	,	the	 express 	 ions 	 	of	truth	and	 beaut 	 y 	 	in	the	 art 	 s 	 	and	truth	and	 beaut 	 y 	 	in	the	 science 	 s 	 	.
and	while	these	are	both	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	right	--	they	both	have	 ver 	 y 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	going	for	them	--	truth	and	 beaut 	 y 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 ideal 	 s 	 	that	can	be	 look 	 ed 	 	at	by	the	 science 	 s 	 	and	by	math	are	 al 	 most 	 	like	the	ideal	 con 	 join 	 ed 	 	 t 	 win 	 s 	 	that	a	scientist	would	want	to	date	.
these	are	 express 	 ions 	 	of	truth	 a 	 s 	 	awe	-	full	 thing 	 s 	 	,	by	meaning	they	are	 thing 	 s 	 	you	can	worship	.
they	are	 ideal 	 s 	 	that	are	 power 	 ful 	 	.	they	are	 irreducib 	 le 	 	.	they	are	 un 	 ique 	 	.	they	are	 use 	 ful 	 	--	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	often	a	long	time	after	the	fact	.
and	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	roll	some	of	the	 picture 	 s 	 	now	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	do	n't	want	to	look	at	me	on	the	screen	.
truth	and	 beaut 	 y 	 	are	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	often	 opa 	 que 	 	to	people	who	are	not	in	the	 science 	 s 	 	.
they	are	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 de 	 scribe 	 	 beaut 	 y 	 	in	a	way	that	is	often	 on 	 ly 	 	 access 	 ible 	 	if	you	understand	the	language	and	the	 syn 	 tax 	 	of	the	person	who	 stud 	 ies 	 	the	subject	in	which	truth	and	 beaut 	 y 	 	is	 express 	 ed 	 	.
if	you	look	at	the	math	,	e	=	mc	 square 	 d 	 	,	if	you	look	at	the	 cosmo 	 logical 	 	constant	,	where	there	's	an	 anthro 	 pic 	 	ideal	,	where	you	see	that	life	had	to	evolve	from	the	 number 	 s 	 	that	 de 	 scribe 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	--	these	are	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 re 	 ally 	 	difficult	to	understand	.
and	what	i	've	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	do	since	i	had	my	training	 a 	 s 	 	a	medical	 illustr 	 ator 	 	--	since	i	was	taught	 anim 	 ation 	 	by	my	father	,	who	was	a	 sculpt 	 or 	 	and	my	visual	mentor	--	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	figure	out	a	way	to	help	people	understand	truth	and	 beaut 	 y 	 	in	the	 bio 	 logical 	 	 science 	 s 	 	by	using	 anim 	 ation 	 	,	by	using	 picture 	 s 	 	,	by	 tell 	 ing 	 	 st 	 ories 	 
so	that	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	evident	to	people	can	be	 br 	 ought 	 	forth	,	and	can	be	taught	,	and	can	be	 under 	 stood 	 	.
 student 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	are	often	 immers 	 ed 	 	in	an	environment	where	what	they	learn	is	 subject 	 s 	 	that	have	truth	and	 beaut 	 y 	 	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	in	them	,	but	the	way	they	're	taught	is	 compartment 	 al 	 ized 	 	and	it	's	drawn	down	to	the	point	where	the	truth	and	 beaut 	 y 	 	are	not	 al 	 ways 	 	evident	.
it	's	 al 	 most 	 	like	that	old	recipe	for	chicken	soup	where	you	boil	the	chicken	 un 	 til 	 	the	flavor	is	just	gone	.
we	do	n't	want	to	do	that	to	our	 student 	 s 	 	.
so	we	have	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	 re 	 ally 	 	open	up	education	.
and	i	had	a	 tele 	 phone 	 	call	from	robert	lue	at	harvard	,	in	the	 mole 	 cular 	 	and	cellular	biology	 depart 	 ment 	 	,	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.	he	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	if	my	team	and	i	would	be	 interest 	 ed 	 	and	 will 	 ing 	 	to	 re 	 ally 	 	change	how	medical	and	scientific	education	is	 d 	 one 	 	at	harvard	.
so	we	 embark 	 ed 	 	on	a	project	that	would	explore	the	cell	--	that	would	explore	the	truth	and	 beaut 	 y 	 	inherent	in	 mole 	 cular 	 	and	cellular	biology	so	that	 student 	 s 	 	could	understand	a	 large 	 r 	 	picture	that	they	could	hang	all	of	these	 fact 	 s 	 	on	.
they	could	have	a	mental	image	of	the	cell	 a 	 s 	 	a	large	,	 bust 	 ling 	 	,	 huge 	 ly 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	city	that	's	occupied	by	micro	-	 machine 	 s 	 	.
and	these	micro	-	 machine 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	are	at	the	heart	of	life	.
these	micro	-	 machine 	 s 	 	,	which	are	the	 en 	 vy 	 	of	 nano 	 techno 	 logists 	 	the	world	over	,	are	self	-	 direct 	 ed 	 	,	 power 	 ful 	 	,	precise	,	accurate	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	that	are	made	out	of	 string 	 s 	 	of	 am 	 ino 	 	 acid 	 s 	 	.
and	these	micro	-	 machine 	 s 	 	power	how	a	cell	 move 	 s 	 	.	they	power	how	a	cell	 replicate 	 s 	 	.	they	power	our	 heart 	 s 	 	.	they	power	our	 mind 	 s 	 	.
and	so	what	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	was	to	figure	out	how	we	could	make	 th 	 is 	 	story	 in 	 to 	 	an	 anim 	 ation 	 	that	would	be	the	 center 	 piece 	 	of	biovisions	at	harvard	,	which	is	a	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	that	harvard	 ha 	 s 	 	for	 it 	 s 	 	 mole 	 cular 	 	and	cellular	biology	 student 	 s 	 	that	will	--	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	all	the	textual	information	,	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	all	the	 did 	 act 	 ic 	 	stuff	--	put	 every 	 thing 	 	together	 visual 	 ly 	 	,	so	that	these	 student 	 s 	 	would	have	an	 internal 	 ized 	 	view	of	what	a	cell	 re 	 ally 	 	is	in	all	of	 it 	 s 	 	truth	and	 beaut 	 y 	 	,	and	be	able	to	 stud 	 y 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	view	in	mind	,	so	that	 the 	 ir 	 	 imagin 	 ations 	 	would	be	 spark 	 ed 	 	,	so	that	 the 	 ir 	 	 pass 	 ions 	 	would	be	 spark 	 ed 	 	and	so	that	they	would	be	able	to	go	on	and	use	these	 vision 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	head	to	make	new	 discover 	 ies 	 	and	to	be	able	to	find	out	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	how	life	 work 	 s 	 	.
so	we	set	out	by	looking	at	how	these	 molecule 	 s 	 	are	put	together	.
we	 work 	 ed 	 	with	a	theme	,	which	is	,	you	've	got	 macro 	 phage 	 s 	 	that	are	 stream 	 ing 	 	down	a	 cap 	 ill 	 ary 	 	,	and	they	're	 touch 	 ing 	 	the	surface	of	the	 cap 	 ill 	 ary 	 	wall	,	and	they	're	 pick 	 ing 	 	up	information	from	 cell 	 s 	 	that	are	on	the	 cap 	 ill 	 ary 	 	wall	,	and	they	are	 give 	 n 	 	 th 	 is 	 	information	that	there	's	an	 inflamm 	 ation 	 	 some 	 where 	 	 out 	 side 	 	,	where	they	ca	n't	see	and	sense	.
but	they	get	the	information	that	 cause 	 s 	 	them	to	stop	,	 cause 	 s 	 	them	to	 internal 	 ize 	 	that	they	need	to	make	all	of	the	 vari 	 ous 	 	 part 	 s 	 	that	will	cause	them	to	change	 the 	 ir 	 	shape	,	and	try	to	get	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	 cap 	 ill 	 ary 	 	and	find	out	what	's	going	on	.
so	these	 mole 	 cular 	 	 motor 	 s 	 	--	we	had	to	work	with	the	harvard	 scientist 	 s 	 	and	 data 	 bank 	 	 model 	 s 	 	of	the	 atomic 	 ally 	 	accurate	 molecule 	 s 	 	and	figure	out	how	they	 move 	 d 	 	,	and	figure	out	what	they	did	.
and	figure	out	how	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	in	a	way	that	was	 truth 	 ful 	 	in	that	it	 im 	 part 	 ed 	 	what	was	going	on	,	but	not	so	 truth 	 ful 	 	that	the	compact	 crowd 	 ing 	 	in	a	cell	would	prevent	the	vista	from	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
and	so	what	i	'm	going	to	show	you	is	a	three	-	minute	 read 	 er 	 	's	digest	version	of	the	first	 a 	 spect 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	film	that	we	 produce 	 d 	 	.	it	's	an	 on 	 going 	 	project	that	's	going	to	go	 an 	 other 	 	four	or	five	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	i	want	you	to	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	and	see	the	 path 	 s 	 	that	the	cell	 manufactur 	 es 	 	--	these	little	 walk 	 ing 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	,	they	're	 call 	 ed 	 	 kine 	 s 	 in 	 s 	 	--	that	take	these	huge	 load 	 s 	 	that	would	 challeng 	 e 	 	an	ant	in	 relat 	 ive 	 	 s 	 ize 	 	.
run	the	movie	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	.
but	these	 machine 	 s 	 	that	power	the	 in 	 side 	 	of	the	 cell 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	,	and	they	 re 	 ally 	 	are	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	all	life
 be 	 cause 	 	all	of	these	 machine 	 s 	 	interact	with	each	other	.
they	pass	information	to	each	other	.	they	cause	different	 thing 	 s 	 	to	happen	 in 	 side 	 	the	cell	.
and	the	cell	will	 actual 	 ly 	 	 manufactur 	 e 	 	the	 part 	 s 	 	that	it	 need 	 s 	 	on	the	fly	,	from	information	that	's	 br 	 ought 	 	from	the	nucleus	by	 molecule 	 s 	 	that	read	the	 gene 	 s 	 	.
no	life	,	from	the	 small 	 est 	 	life	to	 every 	 body 	 	here	,	would	be	possible	 with 	 out 	 	these	little	micro	-	 machine 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	it	would	 re 	 ally 	 	,	in	the	 ab 	 s 	 ence 	 	of	these	 machine 	 s 	 	,	have	made	the	 attend 	 ance 	 	here	,	chris	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 s 	 parse 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	fedex	 deliver 	 y 	 	guy	of	the	cell	.	 th 	 is 	 	little	guy	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 kine 	 s 	 in 	 	,	and	he	 pull 	 s 	 	a	 s 	 ack 	 	that	's	full	of	brand	new	 manufactur 	 ed 	 	 protein 	 s 	 	to	 where 	 ver 	 	it	's	 need 	 ed 	 	in	the	cell	--	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	to	a	membrane	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	to	an	 organ 	 elle 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	to	build	 some 	 thing 	 	or	repair	 some 	 thing 	 	.
and	each	of	us	 ha 	 s 	 	about	100,000	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	running	around	,	right	now	,	 in 	 side 	 	each	one	of	your	100	trillion	 cell 	 s 	 	.
so	no	matter	how	 laz 	 y 	 	you	feel	,	you	're	not	 re 	 ally 	 	 intrinsic 	 ally 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
so	what	i	want	you	to	do	when	you	go	home	is	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	think	about	how	 power 	 ful 	 	our	 cell 	 s 	 	are	.	and	think	about	some	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 learn 	 ing 	 	about	cellular	 mechanic 	 s 	 	.
once	we	figure	out	all	that	's	going	on	--	and	 believ 	 e 	 	me	,	we	know	 al 	 most 	 	a	percent	of	what	's	going	on	--	once	we	figure	out	what	's	going	on	,	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	going	to	be	able	to	have	a	lot	of	control	over	what	we	do	with	our	health	,	with	what	we	do	with	future	 generation 	 s 	 	,	and	how	long	we	're	going	to	live	.
and	 hope 	 fully 	 	we	'll	be	able	to	use	 th 	 is 	 	to	discover	more	truth	,	and	more	 beaut 	 y 	 	.
but	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	that	these	 cell 	 s 	 	,	these	micro	-	 machine 	 s 	 	,	are	aware	 en 	 ough 	 	of	what	the	cell	 need 	 s 	 	that	they	do	 the 	 ir 	 	 bid 	 d 	 ing 	 	.
they	work	together	.	they	make	the	cell	do	what	it	 need 	 s 	 	to	do	.
and	 the 	 ir 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	together	 help 	 s 	 	our	bodies	--	huge	 ent 	 ities 	 	that	they	will	never	see	--	function	 proper 	 ly 	 	.
enjoy	the	rest	of	the	show	.	thank	you	.
