i	'm	going	to	talk	about	the	simple	truth	in	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	in	the	21st	century	.
in	the	21st	century	,	we	need	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	look	at	--	and	what	i	'm	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	to	 encourag 	 e 	 	you	to	consider	 to 	 day 	 	--	is	to	go	back	to	our	school	 day 	 s 	 	when	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	how	to	count	.
but	i	think	it	's	time	for	us	to	think	about	what	we	count	.
 be 	 cause 	 	what	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	count	 tru 	 ly 	 	 count 	 s 	 	.
let	me	start	by	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	a	little	story	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	van	quach	.
she	came	to	 th 	 is 	 	country	in	1986	from	vietnam	.
she	 change 	 d 	 	her	name	to	vivian	 be 	 cause 	 	she	 want 	 ed 	 	to	fit	in	here	in	america	.
her	first	job	was	at	an	inner	-	city	 mote 	 l 	 	in	san	francisco	 a 	 s 	 	a	maid	.
i	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	buy	that	 mote 	 l 	 	about	three	 month 	 s 	 	after	vivian	 start 	 ed 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	there	.
so	vivian	and	i	have	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	together	for	23	 year 	 s 	 	.
with	the	 youth 	 ful 	 	 ideal 	 ism 	 	of	a	26	-	year	-	old	,	in	1987	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	my	company	and	i	 call 	 ed 	 	it	 jo 	 ie 	 	de	 viv 	 re 	 	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 im 	 practical 	 	name	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	was	looking	to	create	joy	of	life	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	first	hotel	that	i	 b 	 ought 	 	,	 mote 	 l 	 	,	was	a	pay	-	by	-	the	-	hour	,	no	-	tell	 mote 	 l 	 	in	the	inner	-	city	of	san	francisco	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 pent 	 	time	with	vivian	,	i	saw	that	she	had	sort	of	a	 jo 	 ie 	 	de	 viv 	 re 	 	in	how	she	did	her	work	.
it	made	me	question	and	 cur 	 ious 	 	:	how	could	 some 	 one 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	find	joy	in	 clean 	 ing 	 	 toilet 	 s 	 	for	a	living	?
so	i	 s 	 pent 	 	time	with	vivian	,	and	i	saw	that	she	did	n't	find	joy	in	 clean 	 ing 	 	 toilet 	 s 	 	.
her	job	,	her	goal	and	her	 call 	 ing 	 	was	not	to	 be 	 come 	 	the	world	's	 great 	 est 	 	toilet	 scrub 	 ber 	 	.
what	 count 	 s 	 	for	vivian	was	the	 emotion 	 al 	 	 connect 	 ion 	 	she	 create 	 d 	 	with	her	fellow	 employ 	 ees 	 	and	our	 guest 	 s 	 	.
and	what	 g 	 ave 	 	her	inspiration	and	meaning	was	the	fact	that	she	was	taking	care	of	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	far	away	from	home	.
 be 	 cause 	 	vivian	 k 	 new 	 	what	it	was	like	to	be	far	away	from	home	.
that	 ver 	 y 	 	human	 less 	 on 	 	,	more	than	20	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 serv 	 ed 	 	me	well	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	last	economic	 down 	 turn 	 	we	had	.
in	the	wake	of	the	 dot 	 com 	 	crash	and	9/11	,	san	francisco	 ba 	 y 	 	area	 hotel 	 s 	 	went	through	the	largest	 percent 	 age 	 	revenue	drop	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	american	 hotel 	 s 	 	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	the	largest	 oper 	 ator 	 	of	 hotel 	 s 	 	in	the	 ba 	 y 	 	area	,	so	we	 we 	 re 	 	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 vulner 	 able 	 	.
but	 al 	 so 	 	back	then	,	remember	we	 stop 	 ped 	 	eating	french	 f 	 ries 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	.
well	,	not	 exact 	 ly 	 	,	of	course	not	.
we	 start 	 ed 	 	eating	``	 free 	 dom 	 	 f 	 ries 	 	,	``
and	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 boycott 	 ing 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	that	was	french	.
well	,	my	name	of	my	company	,	 jo 	 ie 	 	de	 viv 	 re 	 	--
so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	these	 letter 	 s 	 	from	 place 	 s 	 	like	alabama	and	 o 	 range 	 	 count 	 y 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	to	me	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	boycott	my	company	 be 	 cause 	 	they	thought	we	 we 	 re 	 	a	french	company	.
and	i	'd	write	them	back	,	and	i	'd	say	,	``	what	a	minute	.	we	're	not	french	.
we	're	an	american	company	.	we	're	based	in	san	francisco	.	``
and	i	'd	get	a	 ter 	 s 	 e 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	:	``	oh	,	that	's	 wo 	 rse 	 	.	``
so	one	 part 	 icular 	 	day	when	i	was	 feel 	 ing 	 	a	little	 depress 	 ed 	 	and	not	a	lot	of	 jo 	 ie 	 	de	 viv 	 re 	 	,	i	 end 	 ed 	 	up	in	the	local	 book 	 store 	 	around	the	corner	from	our	 off 	 ice 	 s 	 	.
and	i	 initi 	 ally 	 	 end 	 ed 	 	up	in	the	business	section	of	the	 book 	 store 	 	looking	for	a	business	solution	.
but	 give 	 n 	 	my	 befuddle 	 d 	 	state	of	mind	,	i	 end 	 ed 	 	up	in	the	self	-	help	section	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
that	's	where	i	got	 re 	 acquaint 	 ed 	 	with	abraham	maslow	's	``	 hierarch 	 y 	 	of	 need 	 s 	 	.	``
i	took	one	 psycho 	 logy 	 	class	in	college	,	and	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	guy	,	abraham	maslow	,	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	of	us	are	familiar	with	his	 hierarch 	 y 	 	of	 need 	 s 	 	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 at 	 	there	for	four	 hour 	 s 	 	,	the	full	afternoon	,	 read 	 ing 	 	maslow	,	i	 recogn 	 ized 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	true	of	most	 lead 	 ers 	 	.
one	of	the	 simpl 	 est 	 	 fact 	 s 	 	in	business	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	often	neglect	,
and	that	is	that	we	're	all	human	.
each	of	us	,	no	matter	what	our	role	is	in	business	,	 ha 	 s 	 	some	 hierarch 	 y 	 	of	 need 	 s 	 	in	the	 work 	 place 	 	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 read 	 ing 	 	more	maslow	,	what	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	 real 	 ize 	 	is	that	maslow	,	 lat 	 er 	 	in	his	life	,	 want 	 ed 	 	to	take	 th 	 is 	 	 hierarch 	 y 	 	for	the	individual	and	 app 	 ly 	 	it	to	the	 collect 	 ive 	 	,	to	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	and	 specific 	 ally 	 	to	business	.
but	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	he	 di 	 ed 	 	 pre 	 mature 	 ly 	 	in	1970	,
and	so	he	was	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	able	to	live	that	dream	 complete 	 ly 	 	.
so	i	 real 	 ized 	 	in	that	 dot 	 com 	 	crash	that	my	role	in	life	was	to	channel	abe	maslow	.
and	that	's	what	i	did	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	when	i	took	that	five	-	level	 hierarch 	 y 	 	of	 need 	 s 	 	pyramid	and	 turn 	 ed 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	what	i	call	the	 transform 	 ation 	 	pyramid	,	which	is	 surviv 	 al 	 	,	success	and	 transform 	 ation 	 	.
it	's	not	just	fundamental	in	business	,	it	's	fundamental	in	life	.
and	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	the	 question 	 s 	 	about	how	we	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 address 	 ing 	 	the	 high 	 er 	 	 need 	 s 	 	,	these	 transform 	 ation 	 al 	 	 need 	 s 	 	for	our	key	 employ 	 ees 	 	in	the	company	.
these	three	 level 	 s 	 	of	the	 hierarch 	 y 	 	 need 	 s 	 	 re 	 late 	 	to	the	five	 level 	 s 	 	of	maslow	's	 hierarch 	 y 	 	of	 need 	 s 	 	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	about	how	we	 we 	 re 	 	 address 	 ing 	 	the	 high 	 er 	 	 need 	 s 	 	of	our	 employ 	 ees 	 	and	our	 custom 	 ers 	 	,	i	 real 	 ized 	 	we	had	no	 metric 	 s 	 	.
we	had	 noth 	 ing 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	could	tell	us	 whet 	 her 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	it	right	.
so	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	:	what	kind	of	less	obvious	 metric 	 s 	 	could	we	use	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	evaluate	our	 employ 	 ees 	 	'	sense	of	meaning	,	or	our	 custom 	 ers 	 	'	sense	of	 emotion 	 al 	 	 connect 	 ion 	 	with	us	?
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	our	 employ 	 ees 	 	,	do	they	understand	the	mission	of	our	company	,	and	do	they	feel	like	they	 believ 	 e 	 	in	it	,	can	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	influence	it	,	and	do	they	feel	that	 the 	 ir 	 	work	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	an	impact	on	it	?
we	 start 	 ed 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	our	 custom 	 ers 	 	,	did	they	feel	an	 emotion 	 al 	 	 connect 	 ion 	 	with	us	,	in	one	of	seven	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	ways	.
 miracul 	 ously 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	these	 question 	 s 	 	and	 start 	 ed 	 	giving	attention	 high 	 er 	 	up	the	pyramid	,	what	we	found	is	we	 create 	 d 	 	more	 loyal 	 ty 	 	.
our	 custom 	 er 	 	 loyal 	 ty 	 	 skyrocket 	 ed 	 	.
our	 employ 	 ee 	 	 turn 	 over 	 	 drop 	 ped 	 	to	one	-	third	of	the	industry	average	,
and	 dur 	 ing 	 	that	five	year	 dot 	 com 	 	bust	,	we	 triple 	 d 	 	in	 s 	 ize 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	went	out	and	 start 	 ed 	 	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	time	with	other	 lead 	 ers 	 	out	there	and	 ask 	 ing 	 	them	how	they	 we 	 re 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	through	that	time	,	what	they	told	me	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	was	that	they	just	manage	what	they	can	measure	.
what	we	can	measure	is	that	tangible	stuff	at	the	bottom	of	the	pyramid	.
they	did	n't	even	see	the	 in 	 tangible 	 	stuff	 high 	 er 	 	up	the	pyramid	.
so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	 my 	 self 	 	the	question	:	how	can	we	get	 lead 	 ers 	 	to	start	 valu 	 ing 	 	the	 in 	 tangible 	 	?
if	we	're	taught	 a 	 s 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	to	just	manage	what	we	can	measure	,	and	all	we	can	measure	is	the	tangible	in	life	,	we	're	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	a	whole	lot	of	 thing 	 s 	 	at	the	top	of	the	pyramid	.
so	i	went	out	and	 stud 	 ied 	 	a	bunch	of	 thing 	 s 	 	,
and	i	found	a	survey	that	 show 	 ed 	 	that	94	percent	of	business	 lead 	 ers 	 	 world 	 wide 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	the	 in 	 tangible 	 s 	 	are	 import 	 ant 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	business	,	 thing 	 s 	 	like	intellectual	 proper 	 ty 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	corporate	culture	,	 the 	 ir 	 	brand	 loyal 	 ty 	 	,
and	yet	,	 on 	 ly 	 	five	percent	of	 t 	 hose 	 	same	 lead 	 ers 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	a	 mean 	 s 	 	of	 measur 	 ing 	 	the	 in 	 tangible 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	business	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	,	we	understand	that	 in 	 tangible 	 s 	 	are	 import 	 ant 	 	,	but	we	do	n't	have	a	clue	how	to	measure	them	.
so	here	's	 an 	 other 	 	einstein	quote	:	``	not	 every 	 thing 	 	that	can	be	 count 	 ed 	 	 count 	 s 	 	,	and	not	 every 	 thing 	 	that	 count 	 s 	 	can	be	 count 	 ed 	 	.	``
i	hate	to	 argu 	 e 	 	with	einstein	,	but	if	that	which	is	most	 valu 	 able 	 	in	our	life	and	our	business	 actual 	 ly 	 	ca	n't	be	 count 	 ed 	 	or	 valu 	 ed 	 	,	are	n't	we	going	to	 s 	 pend 	 	our	 live 	 s 	 	just	 mi 	 red 	 	in	 measur 	 ing 	 	the	mundane	?
it	was	that	sort	of	 head 	 y 	 	question	about	what	 count 	 s 	 	that	led	me	to	take	my	ceo	hat	off	for	a	week	and	fly	off	to	the	himalayan	 peak 	 s 	 	.
i	flew	off	to	a	place	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	 shroud 	 ed 	 	in	 myster 	 y 	 	for	centuries	,	a	place	some	 folk 	 s 	 	call	shangri	-	la	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 move 	 d 	 	from	the	 surviv 	 al 	 	base	of	the	pyramid	to	 be 	 coming 	 	a	 transform 	 ation 	 al 	 	role	model	for	the	world	.
i	went	to	bhutan	.
the	 teen 	 age 	 	king	of	bhutan	was	 al 	 so 	 	a	 cur 	 ious 	 	man	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	was	back	in	1972	,	when	he	 ascend 	 ed 	 	to	the	 thr 	 one 	 	two	 day 	 s 	 	after	his	father	 pass 	 ed 	 	away	.
at	age	17	,	he	 start 	 ed 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 question 	 s 	 	that	you	'd	expect	of	 some 	 one 	 	with	a	 beg 	 inner 	 	's	mind	.
on	a	trip	through	india	,	early	in	his	reign	 a 	 s 	 	king	,	he	was	 ask 	 ed 	 	by	an	indian	journalist	about	the	bhutanese	gdp	,	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	bhutanese	gdp	.
the	king	 respond 	 ed 	 	in	a	fashion	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 transform 	 ed 	 	us	four	 decade 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	:	``	why	are	we	so	 obsess 	 ed 	 	and	focused	with	gross	domestic	product	?
why	do	n't	we	care	more	about	gross	national	happiness	?	``
now	,	in	 es 	 s 	 ence 	 	,	the	king	was	 ask 	 ing 	 	us	to	consider	an	 alter 	 native 	 	definition	of	success	,	what	 ha 	 s 	 	come	to	be	known	 a 	 s 	 	gnh	,	or	gross	national	happiness	.
most	world	 lead 	 ers 	 	did	n't	take	notice	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	that	did	thought	 th 	 is 	 	was	just	``	buddhist	 economic 	 s 	 	.	``
but	the	king	was	serious	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	 not 	 able 	 	moment	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	first	time	a	world	 lead 	 er 	 	in	 al 	 most 	 	200	 year 	 s 	 	had	 suggest 	 ed 	 	that	 in 	 tangible 	 	of	happiness	--	that	 lead 	 er 	 	200	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	thomas	jefferson	with	the	 decla 	 ration 	 	of	 in 	 depend 	 ence 	 	--	200	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	king	was	 suggest 	 ing 	 	that	 in 	 tangible 	 	of	happiness	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	should	measure	,	and	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	we	should	 actual 	 ly 	 	value	 a 	 s 	 	government	 official 	 s 	 	.
for	the	next	three	dozen	 year 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	king	,	 th 	 is 	 	king	 actual 	 ly 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	 measur 	 ing 	 	and	 man 	 aging 	 	around	happiness	in	bhutan	--
 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	,	just	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	taking	his	country	from	 be 	 ing 	 	an	absolute	 mon 	 arch 	 y 	 	to	a	 constit 	 ution 	 al 	 	 mon 	 arch 	 y 	 	with	no	 blood 	 shed 	 	,	no	coup	.
bhutan	,	for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	do	n't	know	it	,	is	the	 new 	 est 	 	 demo 	 cracy 	 	in	the	world	,	just	two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 pent 	 	time	with	 lead 	 ers 	 	in	the	gnh	 move 	 ment 	 	,	i	got	to	 re 	 ally 	 	understand	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	got	to	 s 	 pend 	 	some	time	with	the	prime	 mini 	 ster 	 	.
over	 d 	 inner 	 	,	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	him	an	 imper 	 tin 	 ent 	 	question	.
i	 ask 	 ed 	 	him	,	``	how	can	you	create	and	measure	 some 	 thing 	 	which	 evapo 	 rates 	 	--	in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	happiness	?	``
and	he	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	wise	man	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	listen	,	bhutan	's	goal	is	not	to	create	happiness	.
we	create	the	 condition 	 s 	 	for	happiness	to	occur	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	we	create	a	 habit 	 at 	 	of	happiness	.	``
 w 	 ow 	 	,	that	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	that	they	have	a	science	 be 	 hind 	 	that	art	,
and	they	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	 create 	 d 	 	four	essential	 pillar 	 s 	 	,	nine	key	 indic 	 ators 	 	and	72	different	 metric 	 s 	 	that	help	them	to	measure	 the 	 ir 	 	gnh	.
one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	key	 indic 	 ators 	 	is	:	how	do	the	bhutanese	feel	about	how	they	 s 	 pend 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	time	each	day	?
it	's	a	good	question	.	how	do	you	feel	about	how	you	 s 	 pend 	 	your	time	each	day	?
time	is	one	of	the	 scarce 	 st 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	in	the	modern	world	.
and	yet	,	of	course	,	that	little	 in 	 tangible 	 	piece	of	data	 do 	 es 	 	n't	factor	 in 	 to 	 	our	gdp	 calcul 	 ations 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 pent 	 	my	week	up	in	the	himalayas	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	imagine	what	i	call	an	 emotion 	 al 	 	 equ 	 ation 	 	.
and	it	 focus 	 es 	 	on	 some 	 thing 	 	i	read	long	ago	from	a	guy	named	rabbi	hyman	schachtel	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	know	him	?	 any 	 body 	 	?
1954	,	he	wrote	a	book	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	real	 enjoy 	 ment 	 	of	living	,	``
and	he	 suggest 	 ed 	 	that	happiness	is	not	about	 hav 	 ing 	 	what	you	want	;
 in 	 stead 	 	,	it	's	about	 want 	 ing 	 	what	you	have	.
or	in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	i	think	the	bhutanese	 believ 	 e 	 	happiness	 equal 	 s 	 	 want 	 ing 	 	what	you	have	--	imagine	 grat 	 itude 	 	--	 divid 	 ed 	 	by	 hav 	 ing 	 	what	you	want	--	 grat 	 ification 	 	.
the	bhutanese	are	n't	on	some	 aspir 	 ation 	 al 	 	 tread 	 mill 	 	,	 constant 	 ly 	 	focused	on	what	they	do	n't	have	.
 the 	 ir 	 	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 isol 	 ation 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	deep	respect	for	 the 	 ir 	 	culture	and	now	the	 principle 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	gnh	 move 	 ment 	 	all	have	 foster 	 ed 	 	a	sense	of	 grat 	 itude 	 	about	what	they	do	have	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	of	us	here	,	 a 	 s 	 	tedsters	in	the	audience	,	 s 	 pend 	 	more	of	our	time	in	the	bottom	half	of	 th 	 is 	 	 equ 	 ation 	 	,	in	the	 denomi 	 nator 	 	?
we	are	a	bottom	-	heavy	culture	in	more	ways	than	one	.
the	 re 	 ality 	 	is	,	in	western	 count 	 ries 	 	,	 quit 	 e 	 	often	we	do	focus	on	the	 pur 	 suit 	 	of	happiness	 a 	 s 	 	if	happiness	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	have	to	go	out	--	an	object	that	we	're	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	get	,	or	 may 	 be 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 object 	 s 	 	.

do	we	pursue	happiness	with	 hostil 	 ity 	 	?
good	question	.	but	back	to	bhutan	.
bhutan	's	 border 	 ed 	 	on	 it 	 s 	 	north	and	south	by	38	percent	of	the	world	's	population	.
could	 th 	 is 	 	little	country	,	like	a	 start 	 up 	 	in	a	mature	industry	,	be	the	spark	plug	that	 influence 	 s 	 	a	21st	century	of	middle	-	class	in	 chin 	 a 	 	and	india	?
bhutan	's	 create 	 d 	 	the	ultimate	export	,	a	new	global	 curr 	 ency 	 	of	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	,
and	there	are	40	 count 	 ries 	 	around	the	world	 to 	 day 	 	that	are	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	gnh	.
you	may	have	heard	,	 th 	 is 	 	last	fall	nicolas	sarkozy	in	france	 announc 	 ing 	 	the	 result 	 s 	 	of	an	18	-	month	 stud 	 y 	 	by	two	 no 	 bel 	 	 economist 	 s 	 	,	 focus 	 ing 	 	on	happiness	and	 well 	 ness 	 	in	france	.
sarkozy	 suggest 	 ed 	 	that	world	 lead 	 ers 	 	should	stop	 my 	 op 	 ically 	 	 focus 	 ing 	 	on	gdp	and	consider	a	new	index	,	what	some	french	are	 call 	 ing 	 	a	``	 jo 	 ie 	 	de	 viv 	 re 	 	index	.	``
i	like	it	.
co	-	 brand 	 ing 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	.
just	three	 day 	 s 	 	ago	,	three	 day 	 s 	 	ago	here	at	ted	,	we	had	a	 simul 	 cast 	 	of	david	cameron	,	 potential 	 ly 	 	the	next	prime	 mini 	 ster 	 	of	the	uk	,	 quo 	 ting 	 	one	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 speech 	 es 	 	of	all	-	time	,	robert	kennedy	's	 poet 	 ic 	 	speech	from	1968	when	he	 suggest 	 ed 	 	that	we	're	 my 	 op 	 ically 	 	focused	on	the	wrong	thing	and	that	gdp	is	a	 mis 	 place 	 d 	 	metric	.
so	it	 suggest 	 s 	 	that	the	 moment 	 um 	 	is	shifting	.
i	've	taken	that	robert	kennedy	quote	,	and	i	've	 turn 	 ed 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	new	balance	sheet	for	just	a	moment	here	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 collect 	 ion 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	robert	kennedy	 s 	 aid 	 	in	that	quote	.
gdp	 count 	 s 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	from	air	 poll 	 ution 	 	to	the	 destruct 	 ion 	 	of	our	 red 	 wood 	 s 	 	.
but	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	count	the	health	of	our	children	or	the	 integ 	 r 	 ity 	 	of	our	public	 official 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	look	at	these	two	 column 	 s 	 	here	,	 do 	 es 	 	n't	it	make	you	feel	like	it	's	time	for	us	to	start	 figur 	 ing 	 	out	a	new	way	to	count	,	a	new	way	to	imagine	what	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	us	in	life	?
 certain 	 ly 	 	robert	kennedy	 suggest 	 ed 	 	at	the	end	of	the	speech	 exact 	 ly 	 	that	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	gdp	``	 measure 	 s 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	in	short	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	that	which	 make 	 s 	 	life	 worth 	 while 	 	.	``
 w 	 ow 	 	.
so	how	do	we	do	that	?
let	me	say	one	thing	we	can	just	start	 do 	 ing 	 	ten	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	.
why	in	the	heck	in	america	are	we	 do 	 ing 	 	a	census	in	2010	?
we	're	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	10	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	on	the	census	.
we	're	 ask 	 ing 	 	10	simple	 question 	 s 	 	--	it	is	 simpl 	 icity 	 	.
but	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 question 	 s 	 	are	tangible	.
they	're	about	 demo 	 graphic 	 s 	 	.
they	're	about	where	you	live	,	how	 man 	 y 	 	people	you	live	with	,	and	 whet 	 her 	 	you	own	your	home	or	not	.
that	's	about	it	.
we	're	not	 ask 	 ing 	 	 meaning 	 ful 	 	 metric 	 s 	 	.
we	're	not	 ask 	 ing 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 question 	 s 	 	.
we	're	not	 ask 	 ing 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	that	's	 in 	 tangible 	 	.
abe	maslow	 s 	 aid 	 	long	ago	 some 	 thing 	 	you	've	heard	before	,	but	you	did	n't	 real 	 ize 	 	it	was	him	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	if	the	 on 	 ly 	 	tool	you	have	is	a	hammer	,	 every 	 thing 	 	 start 	 s 	 	to	look	like	a	nail	.	``
we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 fool 	 ed 	 	by	our	tool	.
excuse	that	 express 	 ion 	 	.
we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 fool 	 ed 	 	by	our	tool	.
gdp	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	our	hammer	.
and	our	nail	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	19th	-	and	20th	-	century	industrial	-	era	model	of	success	.
and	yet	,	64	percent	of	the	world	's	gdp	 to 	 day 	 	is	in	that	 in 	 tangible 	 	industry	we	call	service	,	the	service	industry	,	the	industry	i	'm	in	.
and	 on 	 ly 	 	36	percent	is	in	the	tangible	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	of	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	and	 agricultur 	 e 	 	.
so	 may 	 be 	 	it	's	time	that	we	get	a	 big 	 ger 	 	 tool 	 box 	 	,	right	?
 may 	 be 	 	it	's	time	we	get	a	 tool 	 box 	 	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	just	count	what	's	 eas 	 ily 	 	 count 	 ed 	 	,	the	tangible	in	life	,	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	 count 	 s 	 	what	we	most	value	,	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 in 	 tangible 	 	.
i	guess	i	'm	sort	of	a	 cur 	 ious 	 	ceo	.
i	was	 al 	 so 	 	a	 cur 	 ious 	 	 economic 	 s 	 	major	 a 	 s 	 	an	 under 	 grad 	 	.
i	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	 economist 	 s 	 	measure	 every 	 thing 	 	in	tangible	 unit 	 s 	 	of	production	and	consumption	 a 	 s 	 	if	each	of	 t 	 hose 	 	tangible	 unit 	 s 	 	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	.
they	are	n't	the	same	.
in	fact	,	 a 	 s 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	,	what	we	need	to	learn	is	that	we	can	influence	the	quality	of	that	unit	of	production	by	creating	the	 condition 	 s 	 	for	our	 employ 	 ees 	 	to	live	 the 	 ir 	 	 call 	 ing 	 	.
in	vivian	's	case	,	her	unit	of	production	is	n't	the	tangible	 hour 	 s 	 	she	 work 	 s 	 	,
it	's	the	 in 	 tangible 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 	she	 make 	 s 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	that	one	hour	of	work	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	dave	arringdale	who	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	 long 	 time 	 	guest	at	vivian	's	 mote 	 l 	 	.
he	 stay 	 ed 	 	there	a	hundred	 time 	 s 	 	in	the	last	20	 year 	 s 	 	,
and	he	's	loyal	to	the	 proper 	 ty 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	relationship	that	vivian	and	her	fellow	 employ 	 ees 	 	have	 create 	 d 	 	with	him	.
they	've	 create 	 d 	 	a	 habit 	 at 	 	of	happiness	for	dave	.
he	 tell 	 s 	 	me	that	he	can	 al 	 ways 	 	count	on	vivian	and	the	staff	there	to	make	him	feel	at	home	.	why	is	it	that	business	 lead 	 ers 	 	and	 invest 	 ors 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	often	do	n't	see	the	 connect 	 ion 	 	between	creating	the	 in 	 tangible 	 	of	 employ 	 ee 	 	happiness	with	creating	the	tangible	of	financial	 profit 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	business	?
we	do	n't	have	to	 choos 	 e 	 	between	inspired	 employ 	 ees 	 	and	 s 	 izable 	 	 profit 	 s 	 	,
we	can	have	both	.
in	fact	,	inspired	 employ 	 ees 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	often	help	make	 s 	 izable 	 	 profit 	 s 	 	,	right	?
so	what	the	world	 need 	 s 	 	now	,	in	my	opinion	,	is	business	 lead 	 ers 	 	and	 politic 	 al 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	who	know	what	to	count	.
we	count	 number 	 s 	 	.
we	count	on	people	.
what	 re 	 ally 	 	 count 	 s 	 	is	when	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	use	our	 number 	 s 	 	to	 tru 	 ly 	 	take	 in 	 to 	 	account	our	people	.
i	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	from	a	maid	in	a	 mote 	 l 	 	and	a	king	of	a	country	.
what	can	you	start	 count 	 ing 	 	 to 	 day 	 	?
what	one	thing	can	you	start	 count 	 ing 	 	 to 	 day 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	would	be	 meaning 	 ful 	 	in	your	life	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	your	work	life	or	your	business	life	?
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
