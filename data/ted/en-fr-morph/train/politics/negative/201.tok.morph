 seem 	 ed 	 	to	be	the	 pass 	 ion 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	not	about	death	.	it	's	 inevit 	 able 	 	,	 terr 	 ible 	 	,	but	 re 	 ally 	 	what	i	want	to	talk	about	is	,	i	'm	just	 fascinate 	 d 	 	by	the	 leg 	 acy 	 	people	 leav 	 e 	 	when	they	die	.
that	's	what	i	want	to	talk	about	.
so	art	buchwald	left	his	 leg 	 acy 	 	of	humor	with	a	video	that	 appear 	 ed 	 	soon	after	he	 di 	 ed 	 	,	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	hi	!	i	'm	art	buchwald	,	and	i	just	 di 	 ed 	 	.	``
and	 mi 	 ke 	 	,	who	i	met	at	galapagos	,	a	trip	which	i	won	at	ted	,	is	 leav 	 ing 	 	 note 	 s 	 	on	 cyber 	 space 	 	where	he	is	 chronic 	 ling 	 	his	journey	through	cancer	.
and	my	father	left	me	a	 leg 	 acy 	 	of	his	 hand 	 writing 	 	through	 letter 	 s 	 	and	a	 note 	 book 	 	.
in	the	last	two	 year 	 s 	 	of	his	life	,	when	he	was	sick	,	he	 fill 	 ed 	 	a	 note 	 book 	 	with	his	 thought 	 s 	 	about	me	.
he	wrote	about	my	 strength 	 s 	 	,	 weak 	 ness 	 es 	 	,	and	gentle	 suggest 	 ions 	 	for	 improve 	 ment 	 	,	 quo 	 ting 	 	specific	 incident 	 s 	 	,	and	held	a	mirror	to	my	life	.
after	he	 di 	 ed 	 	,	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	no	one	 write 	 s 	 	to	me	 any 	 more 	 	.
 hand 	 writing 	 	is	a	 disappear 	 ing 	 	art	.
i	'm	all	for	email	and	 think 	 ing 	 	while	 ty 	 ping 	 	,	but	why	give	up	old	 habit 	 s 	 	for	new	?
why	ca	n't	we	have	letter	writing	and	email	 ex 	 change 	 	in	our	 live 	 s 	 	?
there	are	 time 	 s 	 	when	i	want	to	trade	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 year 	 s 	 	that	i	was	too	 bus 	 y 	 	to	 s 	 it 	 	with	my	dad	and	chat	with	him	,	and	trade	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 year 	 s 	 	for	one	hug	.
but	too	late	.
but	that	's	when	i	take	out	his	 letter 	 s 	 	and	i	read	them	,	and	the	paper	that	 touch 	 ed 	 	his	hand	is	in	mine	,	and	i	feel	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	him	.	so	 may 	 be 	 	we	all	need	to	 leav 	 e 	 	our	children	with	a	value	 leg 	 acy 	 	,	and	not	a	financial	one	.
a	value	for	 thing 	 s 	 	with	a	personal	touch	--	an	 auto 	 graph 	 	book	,	a	soul	-	 search 	 ing 	 	letter	.
if	a	fraction	of	 th 	 is 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	ted	audience	could	be	inspired	to	buy	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	paper	--	john	,	it	'll	be	a	 recycl 	 ed 	 	one	--	and	write	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	letter	to	 some 	 one 	 	they	love	,	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	may	start	a	revolution	where	our	children	may	go	to	 pen 	 man 	 ship 	 	 class 	 es 	 	.	so	what	do	i	plan	to	 leav 	 e 	 	for	my	son	?
i	collect	 auto 	 graph 	 	 book 	 s 	 	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	 author 	 s 	 	in	the	audience	know	i	hound	you	for	them	--	and	cds	too	,	tracy	.
i	plan	to	publish	my	own	 note 	 book 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	 witness 	 ed 	 	my	father	's	body	 be 	 ing 	 	 swallow 	 ed 	 	by	fire	,	i	 s 	 at 	 	by	his	funeral	 py 	 re 	 	and	wrote	.
i	have	no	idea	how	i	'm	going	to	do	it	,
but	i	am	 commit 	 ted 	 	to	 compil 	 ing 	 	his	 thought 	 s 	 	and	mine	 in 	 to 	 	a	book	,	and	 leav 	 e 	 	that	 publish 	 ed 	 	book	for	my	son	.
i	'd	like	to	end	with	a	few	 verse 	 s 	 	of	what	i	wrote	at	my	father	's	 crem 	 ation 	 	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	 linguist 	 s 	 	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	 par 	 don 	 	the	 gram 	 mar 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	've	not	 look 	 ed 	 	at	it	in	the	last	10	 year 	 s 	 	.
i	took	it	out	for	the	first	time	to	come	here	.
