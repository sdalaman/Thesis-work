on	 simpl 	 icity 	 	.	what	a	great	way	to	start	.
first	of	all	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	trend	where	we	have	these	 book 	 s 	 	like	 s 	 uch 	 	and	 s 	 uch 	 	``	for	 d 	 um 	 mies 	 	.	``
do	you	know	these	 book 	 s 	 	,	these	 s 	 uch 	 	and	 s 	 uch 	 	``	for	 d 	 um 	 mies 	 	?	``
my	 daughter 	 s 	 	 point 	 ed 	 	out	that	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	looking	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	bit	of	a	problem	.
but	i	was	looking	 on 	 line 	 	at	amazon.com	for	other	 book 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
you	know	,	there	's	 al 	 so 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	``	complete	idiot	's	guide	?	``
there	's	a	sort	of	business	model	around	 be 	 ing 	 	stupid	in	some	sense	.
we	like	to	have	technology	make	us	feel	bad	,	for	some	strange	reason	.
but	i	 re 	 ally 	 	like	that	,	so	i	wrote	a	book	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	 law 	 s 	 	of	 simpl 	 icity 	 	.	``
i	was	in	milan	last	week	,	for	the	italian	launch	.
it	's	kind	of	a	book	about	 question 	 s 	 	,	 question 	 s 	 	about	 simpl 	 icity 	 	.
 ver 	 y 	 	few	 answer 	 s 	 	.	i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	 wonder 	 ing 	 	 my 	 self 	 	,	what	is	 simpl 	 icity 	 	?
is	it	good	?	is	it	bad	?	is	 complex 	 ity 	 	better	?	i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	.
after	i	wrote	``	the	 law 	 s 	 	of	 simpl 	 icity 	 	,	``	i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 tire 	 d 	 	of	 simpl 	 icity 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	imagine	.
and	so	in	my	life	,	i	've	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	 vac 	 ation 	 	is	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	skill	for	any	kind	of	over	-	achiever	.
 be 	 cause 	 	your	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	will	 al 	 ways 	 	take	away	your	life	,	but	they	can	never	take	away	your	 vac 	 ation 	 	--	in	 theor 	 y 	 	.
so	,	i	went	to	the	cape	last	summer	to	hide	from	 simpl 	 icity 	 	,	and	i	went	to	the	gap	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 on 	 ly 	 	have	black	pants	.
so	i	went	and	 b 	 ought 	 	 kh 	 aki 	 	 short 	 s 	 	or	 what 	 ever 	 	,	and	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 brand 	 ing 	 	was	all	about	``	keep	it	simple	.	``
i	 open 	 ed 	 	up	a	magazine	,	and	visa	's	 brand 	 ing 	 	was	,	``	business	 take 	 s 	 	 simpl 	 icity 	 	.	``
i	develop	 photograph 	 s 	 	,	and	kodak	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	keep	it	simple	.	``
so	,	i	felt	kind	of	weird	that	 simpl 	 icity 	 	was	sort	of	 follow 	 ing 	 	me	around	.
so	,	i	 turn 	 ed 	 	on	the	tv	,	and	i	do	n't	watch	tv	 ver 	 y 	 	much	,	but	you	know	 th 	 is 	 	person	?	 th 	 is 	 	is	paris	hilton	,	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	.
and	she	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	show	,	``	the	simple	life	.	``
so	i	 watch 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.	it	's	not	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	,	a	little	bit	 con 	 fusing 	 	.
so	,	i	 look 	 ed 	 	for	a	different	show	to	watch	.
so	,	i	 open 	 ed 	 	up	 th 	 is 	 	tv	guide	thing	,
and	on	the	e	!	channel	,	 th 	 is 	 	``	simple	life	``	show	is	 ver 	 y 	 	popular	.
they	'll	play	it	over	,	and	over	,	and	over	.
so	it	was	 trauma 	 tizing 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
so	,	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 es 	 cape 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	,	so	i	went	out	to	my	car	.
and	cape	cod	,	there	are	 idy 	 llic 	 	 road 	 s 	 	,	and	all	of	us	can	drive	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	.
and	when	you	drive	,	these	 sign 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	sign	,	it	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	road	``	and	``	road	 approach 	 ing 	 	.	``
so	i	'm	 most 	 ly 	 	 driv 	 ing 	 	 a 	 long 	 	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	and	then	i	saw	 th 	 is 	 	sign	.
so	,	i	thought	 complex 	 ity 	 	was	 attack 	 ing 	 	me	 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	so	i	thought	,	``	ah	,	 simpl 	 icity 	 	.	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.	``
but	then	i	thought	,	``	oh	,	 simpl 	 icity 	 	.	what	would	that	be	like	on	a	beach	?
what	if	the	sky	was	41	percent	gray	?	would	n't	that	be	the	perfect	sky	?	``
i	mean	that	 simpl 	 icity 	 	sky	.
but	in	 re 	 ality 	 	,	the	sky	 look 	 ed 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.	it	was	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	complex	sky	.
you	know	,	with	the	 pink 	 s 	 	and	 blue 	 s 	 	.	we	ca	n't	help	but	love	 complex 	 ity 	 	.
we	're	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	:	we	love	complex	 thing 	 s 	 	.
we	love	 relationship 	 s 	 	--	 ver 	 y 	 	complex	.	so	we	love	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	stuff	.
i	'm	at	 th 	 is 	 	place	 call 	 ed 	 	the	media	lab	.
 may 	 be 	 	some	of	you	 guy 	 s 	 	have	heard	of	 th 	 is 	 	place	.
it	's	designed	by	i.	m.	pei	,	one	of	the	 pre 	 mi 	 er 	 	 modern 	 ist 	 	 architect 	 s 	 	.
 modern 	 ism 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	white	box	,	and	it	's	a	perfect	white	box	.
and	some	of	you	 guy 	 s 	 	are	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	,	etc	.	,	 what 	 ever 	 	.
last	month	,	i	was	at	google	,	and	,	boy	,	that	cafeteria	,	man	.
you	 guy 	 s 	 	have	 thing 	 s 	 	here	in	silicon	 val 	 ley 	 	like	stock	 option 	 s 	 	.
see	,	in	academia	,	we	get	 title 	 s 	 	,	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 title 	 s 	 	.
last	year	at	ted	,	these	 we 	 re 	 	all	my	 title 	 s 	 	.	i	had	a	lot	of	 title 	 s 	 	.
i	have	a	default	title	 a 	 s 	 	a	father	of	a	bunch	of	 daughter 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	year	at	ted	,	i	'm	happy	to	report	that	i	have	new	 title 	 s 	 	,	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	my	previous	 title 	 s 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	``	associate	director	of	research	.	``
and	 th 	 is 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	so	i	have	five	 daughter 	 s 	 	now	.
that	's	my	baby	reina	.	thank	you	.
and	so	,	my	life	is	much	more	complex	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	baby	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	but	that	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	we	will	still	stay	married	,	i	think	.
but	looking	way	back	,	when	i	was	a	child	--	you	see	,	i	grew	up	in	a	 to 	 fu 	 	 factor 	 y 	 	in	seattle	.
 man 	 y 	 	of	you	may	not	like	 to 	 fu 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	you	have	n't	had	good	 to 	 fu 	 	,	but	 to 	 fu 	 	's	a	good	food	.	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	kind	of	food	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	work	to	make	 to 	 fu 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	child	,	we	used	to	wake	up	at	1	 a.m 	 . 	 	and	work	till	6	 p.m 	 . 	 	,	six	 day 	 s 	 	a	week	.
my	father	was	kind	of	like	andy	grove	,	 para 	 n 	 oid 	 	of	the	 com 	 petition 	 	.
so	often	,	seven	 day 	 s 	 	a	week	.	family	business	 equal 	 s 	 	child	labor	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	a	great	model	.	so	,	i	 love 	 d 	 	going	to	school	.
school	was	great	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	going	to	school	 help 	 ed 	 	me	get	to	 th 	 is 	 	media	lab	place	,	i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	.
thank	you	.
but	the	media	lab	is	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	place	,	and	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	me
 be 	 cause 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	student	,	i	was	a	computer	science	 under 	 grad 	 	,	and	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	design	 lat 	 er 	 	on	in	my	life	.
and	there	was	 th 	 is 	 	person	,	muriel	cooper	.
who	 know 	 s 	 	muriel	cooper	?	muriel	cooper	?
was	n't	she	 amaz 	 ing 	 	?	muriel	cooper	.	she	was	 wack 	 y 	 	.
and	she	was	a	tedster	,	 exact 	 ly 	 	,	and	she	 show 	 ed 	 	us	,	she	 show 	 ed 	 	the	world	how	to	make	the	computer	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	she	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	in	my	life	,
 be 	 cause 	 	she	's	the	one	that	told	me	to	 leav 	 e 	 	mit	and	go	to	art	school	.
it	was	the	best	 ad 	 vice 	 	i	ever	got	.	so	i	went	to	art	school	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	her	.
she	 pass 	 ed 	 	away	in	1994	,	and	i	was	 hire 	 d 	 	back	to	mit	to	try	to	fill	her	 shoe 	 s 	 	,	but	it	's	so	hard	.
 th 	 is 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	person	,	muriel	cooper	.
when	i	was	in	japan	--	i	went	to	an	art	school	in	japan	--	i	had	a	nice	sort	of	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 some 	 how 	 	i	was	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	paul	rand	.
some	of	you	 guy 	 s 	 	know	paul	rand	,	the	 great 	 est 	 	graphic	 design 	 er 	 	--	i	'm	sorry	--	out	there	.
the	great	graphic	 design 	 er 	 	paul	rand	designed	the	ibm	logo	,	the	westinghouse	logo	.	he	 bas 	 ically 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	've	designed	 every 	 thing 	 	.	``
and	 al 	 so 	 	ikko	tanaka	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	mentor	in	my	life	--	the	paul	rand	of	japan	.	he	designed	most	of	the	major	 icon 	 s 	 	of	japan	,	like	issey	miyake	's	brand	and	 al 	 so 	 	muji	.
when	you	have	 mentor 	 s 	 	--	and	 yester 	 day 	 	,	kareem	abdul	-	jabbar	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	 mentor 	 s 	 	,	these	people	in	your	life	--	the	problem	with	 mentor 	 s 	 	is	that	they	all	die	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 s 	 ad 	 	thing	,	but	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	happy	thing	in	a	way	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	can	remember	them	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 pur 	 e 	 	form	.
i	think	that	the	 mentor 	 s 	 	that	we	all	meet	sort	of	 human 	 ize 	 	us	.
when	you	get	 old 	 er 	 	,	and	you	're	all	 freak 	 ed 	 	out	,	 what 	 ever 	 	,	the	 mentor 	 s 	 	calm	us	down	.
and	i	'm	 grat 	 e 	 ful 	 	for	my	 mentor 	 s 	 	,	and	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	all	of	you	are	too	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	human	thing	is	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	when	you	're	at	mit	.
the	t	 do 	 es 	 	n't	stand	for	``	human	,	``	it	 stand 	 s 	 	for	``	technology	.	``
and	 be 	 cause 	 	of	that	,	i	 al 	 ways 	 	 wonder 	 ed 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	human	thing	.
so	,	i	've	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	googling	 th 	 is 	 	word	,	``	human	,	``	to	find	out	how	 man 	 y 	 	 hit 	 s 	 	i	get	.
and	in	2001	,	i	had	26	million	 hit 	 s 	 	,	and	for	``	computer	,	``	 be 	 cause 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	are	against	 human 	 s 	 	a	bit	,	i	have	42	million	 hit 	 s 	 	.	let	me	do	an	al	gore	here	.
so	,	if	you	sort	of	 compar 	 e 	 	that	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	'll	see	that	computer	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	human	--	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 track 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	for	the	last	year	--	computer	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	human	over	the	last	year	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	.
it	used	to	be	kind	of	two	to	one	.	now	,	 human 	 s 	 	are	 catch 	 ing 	 	up	.
 ver 	 y 	 	good	,	us	 human 	 s 	 	!	we	're	 catch 	 ing 	 	up	with	the	 computer 	 s 	 	.
in	the	 simpl 	 icity 	 	realm	,	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.	so	if	you	 compar 	 e 	 	 complex 	 ities 	 	to	 simpl 	 icity 	 	,	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 catch 	 ing 	 	up	in	a	way	,	too	.
so	,	 some 	 how 	 	 human 	 s 	 	and	 simpl 	 icity 	 	are	 intertwine 	 d 	 	,	i	think	.
i	have	a	 confess 	 ion 	 	:	i	'm	not	a	man	of	 simpl 	 icity 	 	.
i	 s 	 pent 	 	my	entire	early	 care 	 er 	 	making	complex	stuff	.
 lot 	 s 	 	of	complex	stuff	.
i	wrote	computer	 program 	 s 	 	to	make	complex	 graphic 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	had	 client 	 s 	 	in	japan	to	make	 re 	 ally 	 	complex	stuff	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	i	've	 al 	 ways 	 	felt	bad	about	it	,	in	a	sense	.
so	,	i	hid	in	a	time	dimension	.	i	built	 thing 	 s 	 	in	a	time	-	 graphic 	 s 	 	dimension	.
i	did	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 calendar 	 s 	 	for	shiseido	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 flor 	 al 	 	theme	calendar	in	1997	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 fire 	 work 	 	calendar	.	so	,	you	launch	the	number	 in 	 to 	 	space	,
 be 	 cause 	 	the	japanese	 believ 	 e 	 	that	when	you	see	 fire 	 work 	 s 	 	,	you	're	 cool 	 er 	 	for	some	reason	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	why	they	have	 fire 	 work 	 s 	 	in	the	summer	.
a	 ver 	 y 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 	culture	.
 last 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	fall	-	based	calendar	,
 be 	 cause 	 	i	have	so	 man 	 y 	 	 leav 	 es 	 	in	my	yard	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 leav 	 es 	 	in	my	yard	,	 essential 	 ly 	 	.
and	so	i	made	a	lot	of	these	 type 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	to	have	 be 	 en 	 	there	before	people	made	these	kind	of	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	so	i	made	all	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	stuff	that	 mess 	 es 	 	with	your	 eye 	 s 	 	.
i	feel	kind	of	bad	about	that	.
 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	,	paola	antonelli	is	 s 	 peaking 	 	.	i	love	paola	.
she	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	show	right	now	at	moma	,	where	some	of	these	early	 work 	 s 	 	are	here	on	 dis 	 play 	 	at	moma	,	on	the	 wall 	 s 	 	.
if	you	're	in	new	york	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	go	and	see	that	.
but	i	've	had	a	problem	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	make	all	 th 	 is 	 	 fly 	 ing 	 	stuff
and	people	say	,	``	oh	,	i	know	your	work	.	you	're	the	guy	that	 make 	 s 	 	eye	 can 	 dy 	 	.	``	and	when	you	're	told	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	feel	kind	of	weird	.
``	eye	 can 	 dy 	 	``	--	sort	of	 pe 	 jo 	 rative 	 	,	do	n't	you	think	?
so	,	i	say	,	``	no	,	i	make	eye	meat	,	``	 in 	 stead 	 	.
and	eye	meat	is	 some 	 thing 	 	different	,	 some 	 thing 	 	more	 fibro 	 us 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	more	 power 	 ful 	 	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	.	but	what	could	that	be	,	eye	meat	?
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	computer	 program 	 s 	 	all	my	life	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
computer	 program 	 s 	 	are	 essential 	 ly 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	,	and	when	you	make	art	with	a	computer	program	,	there	's	kind	of	a	problem	.
 when 	 ever 	 	you	make	art	with	a	computer	program	,	you	're	 al 	 ways 	 	on	the	tree	,	and	the	paradox	is	that	for	 excel 	 lent 	 	art	,	you	want	to	be	off	the	tree	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	sort	of	a	 complic 	 ation 	 	i	've	found	.
so	,	to	get	off	the	tree	,	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	use	my	old	 computer 	 s 	 	.
i	took	these	to	tokyo	in	2001	to	make	computer	 object 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	new	way	to	type	,	on	my	old	,	color	classic	.
you	ca	n't	type	 ver 	 y 	 	much	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	 al 	 so 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	an	ir	mouse	 respond 	 s 	 	to	crt	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	and	 start 	 s 	 	to	move	by	 it 	 self 	 	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	self	-	 draw 	 ing 	 	machine	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	,	one	year	,	the	g	3	bondi	blue	thing	--	that	 c 	 addy 	 	would	come	out	,	like	,	 danger 	 ous 	 	,	like	,	``	whack	,	``	like	that	.
but	i	thought	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.	what	if	i	make	like	a	car	crash	test	?	``
so	i	have	a	crash	test	.
and	sort	of	measure	the	impact	.	stuff	like	 th 	 is 	 	are	 thing 	 s 	 	i	made	,
just	to	sort	of	understand	what	these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	.
 short 	 ly 	 	after	 th 	 is 	 	,	9/11	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	and	i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 depress 	 ed 	 	.
i	was	 concern 	 ed 	 	with	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	art	that	was	all	about	piss	,	and	sort	of	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 ad 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	so	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	think	about	 some 	 thing 	 	happy	.
so	i	focused	on	food	 a 	 s 	 	my	area	--	these	sort	of	 cl 	 ement 	 ine 	 	peel	 thing 	 s 	 	.
in	japan	,	it	's	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	thing	to	 re 	 move 	 	the	 cl 	 ement 	 ine 	 	peel	just	in	one	piece	.	who	's	 d 	 one 	 	that	before	?	one	-	piece	 cl 	 ement 	 ine 	 	?
oh	,	you	 guy 	 s 	 	are	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	out	,	if	you	have	n't	 d 	 one 	 	it	yet	.
it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	good	,	and	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	i	can	make	 sculpt 	 ures 	 	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	in	different	 form 	 s 	 	.
if	you	dry	them	quick	,	you	can	make	,	like	,	 elephant 	 s 	 	and	 steer 	 s 	 	and	stuff	,	and	my	wife	did	n't	like	these	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	mold	,	so	i	had	to	stop	that	.
so	,	i	went	back	to	the	computer	,	and	i	 b 	 ought 	 	five	large	 f 	 ries 	 	,	and	 s 	 can 	 ned 	 	them	all	.	and	i	was	looking	for	some	kind	of	food	theme	,	and	i	wrote	some	 soft 	 ware 	 	to	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	lay	out	french	-	fry	 image 	 s 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	a	child	,	i	'd	hear	that	song	,	you	know	,	``	oh	,	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	for	 sp 	 acious 	 	 ski 	 es 	 	,	for	 am 	 ber 	 	 wave 	 s 	 	of	grain	,	``	so	i	made	 th 	 is 	 	 am 	 ber 	 	 wave 	 s 	 	image	.
it	's	sort	of	a	 mid 	 west 	 	 corn 	 field 	 	out	of	french	 f 	 ries 	 	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	child	,	i	was	the	 fat 	 test 	 	kid	in	class	,	so	i	used	to	love	cheetos	.	oh	,	i	love	cheetos	,	 y 	 um 	 my 	 	.
so	,	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	play	with	cheetos	in	some	way	.
i	was	n't	 s 	 ure 	 	where	to	go	with	 th 	 is 	 	.	i	 invent 	 ed 	 	cheeto	paint	.
cheeto	paint	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	way	to	paint	with	cheetos	.
i	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	cheetos	are	good	,	 express 	 ive 	 	material	.
and	with	these	cheetos	,	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	think	,	``	what	can	i	make	with	these	cheetos	?	``
and	so	,	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	 crinkl 	 e 	 	up	potato	chip	flecks	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	 pretzel 	 s 	 	.
i	was	looking	for	some	kind	of	form	,	and	in	the	end	,	i	made	100	butter	-	 f 	 ries 	 	.	do	you	get	it	?
and	each	butter	-	fry	is	 compose 	 d 	 	of	different	 piece 	 s 	 	.
people	ask	me	how	they	make	the	antenna	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	they	find	a	hair	in	the	food	.	that	's	my	hair	.
my	hair	's	clean	--	it	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
i	'm	a	 ten 	 ur 	 ed 	 	professor	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	i	do	n't	have	to	work	 any 	 more 	 	.
it	's	a	strange	business	model	.	i	can	come	 in 	 to 	 	work	 every 	 day 	 	and	staple	five	 piece 	 s 	 	of	paper	and	just	 star 	 e 	 	at	it	with	my	latte	.
end	of	story	.
but	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	life	could	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 bor 	 ing 	 	,	so	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	life	,	and	i	notice	that	my	camera	--	my	digital	camera	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	my	car	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	strange	thing	.
the	car	is	so	big	,	the	camera	is	so	small	,	yet	the	manual	for	the	camera	is	so	much	 big 	 ger 	 	than	the	car	manual	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	any	sense	.
so	,	i	was	in	the	cape	one	time	,	and	i	 type 	 d 	 	the	word	``	 simpl 	 icity 	 	,	``
and	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	weird	,	m.	night	shyamalan	way	,	that	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	[	the	]	 letter 	 s 	 	,	m	,	i	,	t.	you	know	the	word	?
in	the	 word 	 s 	 	``	 simpl 	 icity 	 	``	and	``	 complex 	 ity 	 	,	``	m	,	i	,	t	occur	in	perfect	sequence	.
it	's	a	bit	 eer 	 ie 	 	,	is	n't	it	?
so	,	i	thought	,	 may 	 be 	 	i	'll	do	 th 	 is 	 	for	the	next	twenty	 year 	 s 	 	or	 some 	 thing 	 	.
and	i	wrote	 th 	 is 	 	book	,	``	the	 law 	 s 	 	of	 simpl 	 icity 	 	.	``	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	short	,	simple	book	.	there	are	ten	 law 	 s 	 	and	three	 key 	 s 	 	.
the	ten	 law 	 s 	 	and	three	 key 	 s 	 	--	i	wo	n't	go	over	them	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	why	i	have	a	book	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	that	's	why	it	's	on	the	web	for	free	.
but	the	 law 	 s 	 	are	kind	of	like	sushi	in	a	way	:	there	are	all	 kind 	 s 	 	.
in	japan	,	they	say	that	sushi	is	 challeng 	 ing 	 	.
you	know	the	uni	is	the	most	 challeng 	 ing 	 	,	so	number	ten	is	 challeng 	 ing 	 	.	people	hate	number	ten	like	they	hate	uni	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
the	three	 key 	 s 	 	are	easy	to	eat	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 ana 	 go 	 	,	 cook 	 ed 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	,	so	easy	to	eat	.
so	enjoy	your	sushi	meal	 lat 	 er 	 	,	with	the	 law 	 s 	 	of	 simpl 	 icity 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	want	to	 simpl 	 ify 	 	them	for	you	.
 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	what	 th 	 is 	 	is	about	.	i	have	to	 simpl 	 ify 	 	 th 	 is 	 	thing	.
so	,	if	i	 simpl 	 ify 	 	the	 law 	 s 	 	of	 simpl 	 icity 	 	,
i	have	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	cookie	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	 laundr 	 y 	 	thing	.
 any 	 one 	 	who	 ha 	 s 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	 know 	 s 	 	that	if	you	 off 	 er 	 	a	kid	a	big	cookie	or	a	small	cookie	,	which	cookie	are	they	going	to	take	?	the	big	cookie	.
you	can	say	the	small	cookie	 ha 	 s 	 	godiva	chocolate	bits	in	it	,	but	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	.	they	want	the	big	cookie	.
but	if	you	 off 	 er 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	two	 pile 	 s 	 	of	 laundr 	 y 	 	to	fold	,	the	small	pile	or	the	big	pile	,	which	will	they	 choos 	 e 	 	?
 strange 	 ly 	 	,	not	the	big	pile	.	so	,	i	think	it	's	 a 	 s 	 	simple	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
you	know	,	when	you	want	more	,	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	you	want	to	enjoy	it	.	when	you	want	less	,	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	about	work	.
and	so	,	to	boil	it	all	down	,	 simpl 	 icity 	 	is	about	living	life	with	more	 enjoy 	 ment 	 	and	less	pain	.
i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	sort	of	simple	more	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	less	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	,	it	 al 	 ways 	 	 depend 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	book	i	wrote	 be 	 cause 	 	i	want	to	figure	out	life	.
i	love	life	.	i	love	 be 	 ing 	 	 al 	 ive 	 	.	i	like	to	see	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	so	life	is	a	big	question	,	i	think	,	in	 simpl 	 icity 	 	,
 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 simpl 	 ify 	 	your	life	.
and	i	just	love	to	see	the	world	.	the	world	is	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	place	.
by	 be 	 ing 	 	at	ted	,	we	see	so	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	at	one	time	.
and	i	ca	n't	help	but	enjoy	looking	at	 every 	 thing 	 	in	the	world	.
like	 every 	 thing 	 	you	see	,	every	time	you	wake	up	.
it	's	 s 	 uch 	 	a	joy	to	sort	of	experience	 every 	 thing 	 	in	the	world	.
from	 every 	 thing 	 	from	a	weird	hotel	lobby	,	to	saran	wrap	 place 	 d 	 	over	your	window	,	to	 th 	 is 	 	moment	where	i	had	my	road	in	front	of	my	house	 pav 	 ed 	 	dark	black	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	white	moth	was	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	 dy 	 ing 	 	in	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
and	so	,	 th 	 is 	 	whole	thing	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 truck 	 	me	 a 	 s 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	to	be	here	,	 be 	 cause 	 	life	is	 fin 	 ite 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	 give 	 n 	 	to	me	by	the	 chair 	 man 	 	of	shiseido	.
he	's	an	expert	in	aging	.	 th 	 is 	 	 horizon 	 tal 	 	axis	is	how	old	you	are	--	twelve	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	twenty	-	four	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	seventy	-	four	,	ninety	-	six	 year 	 s 	 	old	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	some	medical	data	.	so	,	brain	strength	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	up	to	60	,	and	then	after	60	,	it	sort	of	 go 	 es 	 	down	.	kind	of	 depress 	 ing 	 	in	a	way	.
 al 	 so 	 	,	if	you	look	at	your	physical	strength	.
you	know	,	i	have	a	lot	of	 cock 	 y 	 	 fresh 	 men 	 	at	mit	,	so	i	tell	them	,	``	oh	,	your	bodies	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 strong 	 er 	 	and	 strong 	 er 	 	,	but	in	your	late	twenties	and	mid	-	 thirt 	 ies 	 	,	 cell 	 s 	 	,	they	die	.	``
ok	.	it	 get 	 s 	 	them	to	work	 hard 	 er 	 	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	.
and	if	you	have	your	vision	,	vision	is	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	age	from	infant	age	,	your	vision	 get 	 s 	 	better	,
and	 may 	 be 	 	in	your	late	 teen 	 s 	 	,	early	twenties	,	you	're	looking	for	a	mate	,	and	your	vision	 go 	 es 	 	after	that	.
your	social	 respons 	 ibility 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
so	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	get	 old 	 er 	 	,	you	may	,	like	,	have	 kid 	 s 	 	,	 what 	 ever 	 	.
and	then	the	 kid 	 s 	 	graduate	,	and	you	have	no	 respons 	 ibility 	 	any	more	--	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	good	,	too	.
but	if	any	of	you	people	ask	,	``	what	 actual 	 ly 	 	 go 	 es 	 	up	?	 do 	 es 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	go	up	?
what	's	the	positive	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	know	?	``	i	think	 wis 	 dom 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 go 	 es 	 	up	.
i	love	these	 eight 	 y 	 	-	year	-	old	,	ninety	-	year	-	old	 guy 	 s 	 	and	women	.
they	have	so	 man 	 y 	 	 thought 	 s 	 	,	and	they	have	so	much	 wis 	 dom 	 	,	and	i	think	--	you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	ted	thing	,	i	've	come	here	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	fourth	time	,	and	i	come	here	for	 th 	 is 	 	 wis 	 dom 	 	,	i	think	.
 th 	 is 	 	whole	ted	effect	,	it	sort	of	 up 	 s 	 	your	 wis 	 dom 	 	,	 some 	 how 	 	.
and	i	'm	so	glad	to	be	here	,	and	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	 grat 	 e 	 ful 	 	to	be	here	,	chris	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	experience	for	me	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
