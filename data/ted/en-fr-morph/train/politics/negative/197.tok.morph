you	will	understand	 noth 	 ing 	 	with	my	type	of	english	.
it	's	good	for	you	 be 	 cause 	 	you	can	have	a	break	after	all	these	fantastic	people	.
i	must	tell	you	i	am	like	that	,	not	 ver 	 y 	 	 comfort 	 able 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 usual 	 ly 	 	,	in	life	,	i	think	my	job	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 use 	 less 	 	.
i	mean	,	i	feel	 use 	 less 	 	.
now	after	carolyn	,	and	all	the	other	 guy 	 s 	 	,	i	feel	like	shit	.
and	 definitive 	 ly 	 	,	i	do	n't	know	why	i	am	here	,	but	--	you	know	the	nightmare	you	can	have	,	like	you	are	an	 im 	 post 	 or 	 	,	you	 arriv 	 e 	 	at	the	opera	,	and	they	push	you	,	``	you	must	 s 	 ing 	 	!	``
i	do	n't	know	.
so	,	so	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	have	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	show	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	say	,	we	 s 	 hall 	 	try	to	speak	about	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
we	can	start	,	if	you	want	,	by	 understand 	 ing 	 	--	it	's	just	to	start	,	it	's	not	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	but	--	how	i	work	.
when	 some 	 body 	 	 come 	 s 	 	to	me	and	ask	for	what	i	am	known	,	i	mean	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	lemon	 squeez 	 er 	 	,	toilet	brush	,	 tooth 	 pick 	 	,	 beaut 	 iful 	 	toilet	 seat 	 s 	 	,	and	why	not	--	a	 tooth 	 brush 	 	?
i	do	n't	try	to	design	the	 tooth 	 brush 	 	.
i	do	n't	try	to	say	,	``	oh	,	that	will	be	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	object	,	``	or	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	interest	me	.
 be 	 cause 	 	there	is	different	 type 	 s 	 	of	design	.
the	one	,	we	can	call	it	the	 cynic 	 al 	 	design	,	that	 mean 	 s 	 	the	design	 invent 	 ed 	 	by	raymond	loewy	in	the	'50s	,	who	 s 	 aid 	 	,	what	is	 ug 	 ly 	 	is	a	bad	sale	,	la	 laid 	 eur 	 	 s 	 e 	 	vend	mal	,	which	is	 terr 	 ible 	 	.
it	 mean 	 s 	 	the	design	must	be	just	the	weapon	for	 market 	 ing 	 	,	for	 produce 	 r 	 	to	make	product	more	sexy	,	like	that	,	they	sell	more	:	it	's	shit	,	it	's	 obsolet 	 e 	 	,	it	's	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	.
i	call	that	the	 cynic 	 al 	 	design	.
after	,	there	is	the	 narcissist 	 ic 	 	design	:	it	's	a	fantastic	 design 	 er 	 	who	 design 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	for	other	fantastic	 design 	 ers 	 	.
after	,	there	is	people	like	me	,	who	try	to	deserve	to	exist	,	and	who	are	so	 a 	 shame 	 d 	 	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	 use 	 less 	 	job	,	who	try	to	do	it	in	 an 	 other 	 	way	,	and	they	try	,	i	try	,	to	not	make	the	object	for	the	object	but	for	the	result	,	for	the	profit	for	the	human	 be 	 ing 	 	,	the	person	who	will	use	it	.
if	we	take	the	 tooth 	 brush 	 	--	i	do	n't	think	about	the	 tooth 	 brush 	 	.	i	think	,	``	what	will	be	the	effect	of	the	brush	in	the	mouth	?	``
and	to	understand	what	will	be	the	effect	of	the	 tooth 	 brush 	 	in	the	mouth	,	i	must	imagine	:	who	 own 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	mouth	?
what	is	the	life	of	the	owner	of	 th 	 is 	 	mouth	?	in	what	 socie 	 ty 	 	[	 do 	 es 	 	]	 th 	 is 	 	guy	live	?
what	 civil 	 ization 	 	 create 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	?
what	animal	species	 create 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 civil 	 ization 	 	?
when	i	 arriv 	 e 	 	--	and	i	take	one	minute	,	i	am	not	so	intelligent	--	when	i	 arriv 	 e 	 	at	the	level	of	animal	species	,	that	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	real	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
me	,	i	have	 strict 	 ly 	 	no	power	to	change	 any 	 thing 	 	.
but	when	i	come	back	,	i	can	understand	why	i	 s 	 hall 	 	not	do	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 to 	 day 	 	to	not	do	it	,	it	's	more	positive	than	do	it	,	or	how	i	 s 	 hall 	 	do	it	.
but	to	come	back	,	where	i	am	at	the	animal	species	,	there	is	 thing 	 s 	 	to	see	.
there	is	 thing 	 s 	 	to	see	,	there	is	the	big	 challeng 	 e 	 	.
the	big	 challeng 	 e 	 	in	front	of	us	.
 be 	 cause 	 	there	is	not	a	human	production	which	 exist 	 s 	 	 out 	 side 	 	of	what	i	call	``	the	big	image	.	``	the	big	image	is	our	story	,	our	 poet 	 ry 	 	,	our	 romantic 	 ism 	 	.
our	 poet 	 ry 	 	is	our	mutation	,	our	life	.
we	must	remember	,	and	we	can	see	that	in	any	book	of	my	son	of	10	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	that	life	 appear 	 s 	 	four	billion	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	around	--	four	billion	point	two	?
voice	 off 	 stage 	 	:	four	point	five	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	point	five	,	ok	,	ok	,	ok	!	i	'm	a	 design 	 er 	 	,	that	's	all	,	of	christmas	 gift 	 s 	 	.
and	before	,	there	was	 th 	 is 	 	soup	,	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 soup 	 e 	 	 primordial 	 e 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	first	soup	--	bloop	bloop	bloop	--	sort	of	 dirt 	 y 	 	mud	,	no	life	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
so	then	--	pshoo	-	shoo	--	 light 	 ning 	 	--	pshoo	--	 arriv 	 e 	 	--	pshoo	-	shoo	--	 make 	 s 	 	life	--	bloop	bloop	--	and	that	dies	.
some	million	 year 	 s 	 	after	--	pshoo	-	shoo	,	bloop	-	bloop	--	ah	,	wake	up	!
at	the	end	,	 final 	 ly 	 	,	that	 succeed 	 s 	 	,	and	life	 appear 	 s 	 	.
we	was	so	,	so	stupid	.	the	most	stupid	bacteria	.
even	,	i	think	,	we	copy	our	way	to	 re 	 produce 	 	,	you	know	what	i	mean	,	and	 some 	 thing 	 	of	--	oh	no	,	forget	it	.
after	,	we	 be 	 come 	 	a	fish	;	after	,	we	 be 	 come 	 	a	frog	;	after	,	we	 be 	 come 	 	a	monkey	;	after	,	we	 be 	 come 	 	what	we	are	 to 	 day 	 	:	a	super	-	monkey	,	and	the	 f 	 un 	 	is	,	the	super	-	monkey	we	are	 to 	 day 	 	,	is	at	half	of	the	story	.
can	you	imagine	?	from	that	stupid	bacteria	to	us	,	with	a	 micro 	 phone 	 	,	with	a	computer	,	with	an	ipod	:	four	billion	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	we	know	,	and	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	carolyn	 know 	 s 	 	,	that	when	the	 s 	 un 	 	will	 implod 	 e 	 	,	the	earth	will	burn	,	explode	,	i	do	n't	know	what	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 schedule 	 d 	 	for	four	,	four	billion	 year 	 s 	 	?
 y 	 es 	 	,	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	.	ok	,	that	 mean 	 s 	 	we	are	at	half	of	the	story	.
fantastic	!	it	's	a	 beaut 	 y 	 	!
can	you	imagine	?	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 symbol 	 ic 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	bacteria	we	was	had	no	idea	of	what	we	are	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	 to 	 day 	 	,	we	have	no	idea	of	what	we	 s 	 hall 	 	be	in	four	billion	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 territ 	 ory 	 	is	fantastic	.
that	is	our	 poet 	 ry 	 	.	that	is	our	 beaut 	 iful 	 	story	.
it	's	our	 romantic 	 ism 	 	.	mu	-	ta	-	tion	.	we	are	 mut 	 ants 	 	.
and	if	we	do	n't	 deep 	 ly 	 	understand	,	if	we	do	n't	integrate	that	we	are	 mut 	 ants 	 	,	we	 complete 	 ly 	 	 mis 	 s 	 	the	story	.
 be 	 cause 	 	every	generation	 think 	 s 	 	we	are	the	final	one	.
we	have	a	way	to	look	at	earth	like	that	,	you	know	,	``	i	am	the	man	.	the	final	man	.
you	know	,	we	 mut 	 ate 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	four	billion	 year 	 s 	 	before	,	but	now	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	me	,	we	stop	.	fin	.
for	the	end	,	for	the	 et 	 ern 	 ity 	 	,	it	is	one	with	a	red	jacket	.	``
 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	.	i	am	not	 s 	 ure 	 	of	that	.
 be 	 cause 	 	that	is	our	 intellig 	 ence 	 	of	mutation	and	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	.
there	is	so	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	to	do	;	it	's	so	fresh	.
and	here	is	 some 	 thing 	 	:	 no 	 body 	 	is	 oblig 	 ed 	 	to	be	a	 gen 	 ius 	 	,	but	 every 	 body 	 	is	 oblig 	 ed 	 	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	.
and	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	,	for	a	 mut 	 ant 	 	,	there	is	a	 minim 	 um 	 	of	 exercis 	 e 	 	,	a	 minim 	 um 	 	of	 s 	 port 	 	.
we	can	say	that	.
the	first	,	if	you	want	--	there	is	so	 man 	 y 	 	--	but	one	which	is	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	to	do	,	is	the	duty	of	vision	.
i	can	explain	you	.	i	 s 	 hall 	 	try	.
if	you	walk	like	that	,	it	's	ok	,	it	's	ok	,	you	can	walk	,	but	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	walk	with	the	 eye 	 s 	 	like	that	,	you	will	not	see	,	oh	,	there	is	a	hole	.
and	you	will	fall	,	and	you	will	die	.	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
that	's	why	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	you	will	try	to	have	 th 	 is 	 	angle	of	vision	.
ok	,	i	can	see	,	if	i	found	 some 	 thing 	 	,	up	,	up	,	and	they	 continu 	 e 	 	,	up	up	up	.
i	raise	the	angle	of	vision	,	but	it	's	still	 ver 	 y 	 	--	 self 	 ish 	 	,	 self 	 ish 	 	,	egoiste	--	 y 	 es 	 	,	 self 	 ish 	 	.
you	,	you	 surviv 	 e 	 	.	it	's	ok	.
if	you	raise	the	level	of	your	 eye 	 s 	 	a	little	more	you	go	,	``	i	see	you	,	oh	my	god	you	are	here	,	how	are	you	,	i	can	help	you	,
i	can	design	for	you	a	new	 tooth 	 brush 	 	,	new	toilet	brush	,	``	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
i	live	in	 socie 	 ty 	 	;	i	live	in	community	.
it	's	ok	.	you	start	to	be	in	the	 territ 	 ory 	 	of	 intellig 	 ence 	 	,	we	can	say	.
from	 th 	 is 	 	level	,	the	more	you	can	raise	 th 	 is 	 	angle	of	view	,	the	more	you	will	be	 import 	 ant 	 	for	the	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
the	more	you	will	rise	,	the	more	you	will	be	 import 	 ant 	 	for	the	 civil 	 ization 	 	.
the	more	you	will	rise	,	to	see	far	and	high	,	like	that	,	the	more	you	will	be	 import 	 ant 	 	for	the	story	of	our	mutation	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	intelligent	people	are	in	 th 	 is 	 	angle	.	that	is	 intellig 	 ence 	 	.
from	 th 	 is 	 	to	here	,	that	,	it	's	 gen 	 ius 	 	.
ptolemy	,	eratosthenes	,	einstein	,	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	.
 no 	 body 	 	's	 oblig 	 ed 	 	to	be	a	 gen 	 ius 	 	.
it	's	better	,	but	 no 	 body 	 	.
take	care	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	training	,	to	be	a	good	 mut 	 ant 	 	.	there	is	some	danger	,	there	is	some	trap	.	one	trap	:	the	 vert 	 ical 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	at	the	 vert 	 ical 	 	of	us	,	if	you	look	like	that	,	``	ah	!	my	god	,	there	is	god	.	ah	!	god	!	``
god	is	a	trap	.	god	is	the	answer	when	we	do	n't	know	the	answer	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	,	when	your	brain	is	not	 en 	 ough 	 	big	,	when	you	do	n't	understand	,	you	go	,	``	ah	,	it	's	god	,	it	's	god	.	``	that	's	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	.
that	's	why	--	jump	,	like	that	?	no	,	do	n't	jump	.
come	back	.	 be 	 cause 	 	,	after	,	there	is	 an 	 other 	 	trap	.
if	you	look	like	that	,	you	look	to	the	past	,	or	you	look	 in 	 side 	 	if	you	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 flex 	 ible 	 	,	 in 	 side 	 	 your 	 self 	 	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	 schizo 	 phrenia 	 	,	and	you	are	dead	 al 	 so 	 	.
that	's	why	every	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	now	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	are	a	good	 mut 	 ant 	 	,	you	will	raise	your	angle	of	view	.
out	,	more	of	the	 horizon 	 tal 	 	.	you	are	an	 intellig 	 ence 	 	.
never	forget	--	like	that	,	like	that	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
what	,	what	else	we	can	say	about	that	?	why	do	that	?
it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	we	--	if	we	look	from	far	,	we	see	our	line	of	evolution	.
 th 	 is 	 	line	of	evolution	is	 clear 	 ly 	 	positive	.
from	far	,	 th 	 is 	 	line	 look 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	smooth	,	like	that	.
but	if	you	take	a	lens	,	like	that	,	 th 	 is 	 	line	is	ack	,	ack	,	ack	,	ack	,	ack	.	like	that	.
it	's	made	of	light	and	shadow	.
we	can	say	light	is	 civil 	 ization 	 	,	shadow	is	 barb 	 aria 	 	.
and	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	know	where	we	are	.
 be 	 cause 	 	some	cycle	,	there	is	a	spot	in	the	cycle	,	and	you	have	not	the	same	duty	in	the	different	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	cycle	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	,	we	can	imagine	--	i	do	n't	say	it	was	fantastic	,	but	in	the	'80s	,	there	was	not	too	much	war	,	like	that	,	it	was	--	we	can	imagine	that	the	 civil 	 ization 	 	can	 be 	 come 	 	 civil 	 ized 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	people	like	me	are	 accept 	 able 	 	.
we	can	say	,	``	it	's	 luxur 	 ious 	 	time	.	``
we	have	time	to	think	,	we	have	time	to	i	do	n't	know	what	,	speak	about	art	and	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	.
it	's	ok	.	we	are	in	the	light	.
but	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	like	 to 	 day 	 	,	we	fall	,	we	fall	so	fast	,	so	fast	to	shadow	,	we	fall	so	fast	to	 barb 	 aria 	 	.
with	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	face	of	 barb 	 aria 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	not	,	the	 barb 	 aria 	 	we	have	 to 	 day 	 	,	it	's	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	not	the	 barb 	 aria 	 	we	think	.
there	is	different	type	of	 barb 	 aria 	 	.
that	's	why	we	must	adapt	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	,	when	 barb 	 aria 	 	is	back	,	forget	the	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 chair 	 s 	 	,	forget	the	 beaut 	 iful 	 	hotel	,	forget	design	,	even	--	i	'm	sorry	to	say	--	forget	art	.
forget	all	that	.	there	is	 prior 	 ity 	 	;	there	is	 urge 	 ncy 	 	.
you	must	go	back	to	 politic 	 s 	 	,	you	must	go	back	to	 radical 	 ization 	 	,
i	'm	sorry	if	that	's	not	 ver 	 y 	 	english	.
you	must	go	back	to	fight	,	to	battle	.
that	's	why	 to 	 day 	 	i	'm	so	 a 	 shame 	 d 	 	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	job	.
that	's	why	i	am	here	,	to	try	to	do	it	the	best	possible	.
but	i	know	that	even	i	do	it	the	best	possible	--	that	's	why	i	'm	the	best	--	it	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	not	the	right	time	.
that	's	why	i	say	that	.	i	say	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	i	repeat	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	exist	if	it	's	not	in	the	good	reason	,	the	reason	of	our	 beaut 	 iful 	 	dream	,	of	 th 	 is 	 	 civil 	 ization 	 	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	we	must	all	work	to	finish	 th 	 is 	 	story	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	scenario	of	 th 	 is 	 	 civil 	 ization 	 	--	about	love	,	progress	,	and	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	--	it	's	ok	,	but	there	is	so	 man 	 y 	 	different	,	other	 scenario 	 s 	 	of	other	 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	scenario	,	of	 th 	 is 	 	 civil 	 ization 	 	,	was	about	 be 	 coming 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	,	intelligent	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	idea	we	have	 invent 	 ed 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 cept 	 	of	god	.
we	are	god	now	.	we	are	.	it	's	 al 	 most 	 	 d 	 one 	 	.
we	have	just	to	finish	the	story	.
that	is	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
and	when	you	do	n't	understand	 re 	 ally 	 	what	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	you	can	not	go	and	fight	and	work	and	build	and	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	.
you	go	to	the	future	back	,	back	,	back	,	back	,	like	that	.
and	you	can	fall	,	and	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
no	,	you	must	 re 	 ally 	 	understand	that	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	 al 	 most 	 	 finish 	 ed 	 	,	i	'll	repeat	 th 	 is 	 	story	.
and	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	in	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	50	 year 	 s 	 	,	60	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	can	finish	 complete 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 civil 	 ization 	 	,
and	 off 	 er 	 	to	our	children	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	to	invent	a	new	story	,	a	new	 poet 	 ry 	 	,	a	new	 romantic 	 ism 	 	.
with	 billion 	 s 	 	of	people	who	have	 be 	 en 	 	born	,	 work 	 ed 	 	,	lived	and	 di 	 ed 	 	before	us	,	these	people	who	have	 work 	 ed 	 	so	much	,	we	have	now	 br 	 ing 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 gift 	 s 	 	,	we	know	so	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
we	can	say	to	our	children	,	ok	,	 d 	 one 	 	,	that	was	our	story	.	that	 pass 	 ed 	 	.	now	you	have	a	duty	:	invent	a	new	story	.	invent	a	new	 poet 	 ry 	 	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	rule	is	,	we	have	not	to	have	any	idea	about	the	next	story	.
we	give	you	white	 page 	 s 	 	.	invent	.
we	give	you	the	best	 tool 	 s 	 	,	the	best	 tool 	 s 	 	,	and	now	,	do	it	.
that	's	why	i	 continu 	 e 	 	to	work	,	even	if	it	's	for	toilet	brush	.
