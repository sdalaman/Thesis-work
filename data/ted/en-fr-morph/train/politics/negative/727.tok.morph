 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	danish	 t 	 win 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	 establish 	 ed 	 	that	 on 	 ly 	 	about	10	percent	of	how	long	the	average	person	 live 	 s 	 	,	 with 	 in 	 	certain	 bio 	 logical 	 	 limit 	 s 	 	,	is	 dict 	 ated 	 	by	our	 gene 	 s 	 	.
the	other	90	percent	is	 dict 	 ated 	 	by	our	 life 	 style 	 	.
so	the	 pre 	 mise 	 	of	blue	 zone 	 s 	 	:	if	we	can	find	the	optimal	 life 	 style 	 	of	 long 	 ev 	 ity 	 	we	can	come	up	with	a	de	 fact 	 o 	 	formula	for	 long 	 ev 	 ity 	 	.
but	if	you	ask	the	average	american	what	the	optimal	formula	of	 long 	 ev 	 ity 	 	is	,	they	 prob 	 ably 	 	could	n't	tell	you	.
they	've	 prob 	 ably 	 	heard	of	the	south	beach	diet	,	or	the	atkins	diet	.
you	have	the	usda	food	pyramid	.	there	is	what	oprah	 tell 	 s 	 	us	.
there	is	what	doctor	oz	 tell 	 s 	 	us	.
the	fact	of	the	matter	is	there	is	a	lot	of	 con 	 fusion 	 	around	what	 re 	 ally 	 	 help 	 s 	 	us	live	 long 	 er 	 	better	.
should	you	be	running	 marathon 	 s 	 	or	 do 	 ing 	 	 y 	 oga 	 	?
should	you	eat	 organ 	 ic 	 	 meat 	 s 	 	or	should	you	be	eating	 to 	 fu 	 	?
when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	 supplement 	 s 	 	,	should	you	be	taking	them	?
how	about	these	 hormone 	 s 	 	or	resveratrol	?
and	 do 	 es 	 	purpose	play	 in 	 to 	 	it	?
 spiritual 	 ity 	 	?	and	how	about	how	we	 social 	 ize 	 	?
well	,	our	approach	to	 find 	 ing 	 	 long 	 ev 	 ity 	 	was	to	team	up	with	national	 geo 	 graphic 	 	,	and	the	national	institute	on	aging	,	to	find	the	four	 demo 	 graphical 	 ly 	 	 confirm 	 ed 	 	 area 	 s 	 	that	are	 geo 	 graphical 	 ly 	 	defined	.
and	then	 br 	 ing 	 	a	team	of	 expert 	 s 	 	in	there	to	 method 	 ically 	 	go	through	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	these	people	do	,	to	distill	down	the	cross	-	cultural	 distill 	 ation 	 	.
and	at	the	end	of	 th 	 is 	 	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	what	that	 distill 	 ation 	 	is	.
but	first	i	'd	like	to	debunk	some	common	 myth 	 s 	 	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	 long 	 ev 	 ity 	 	.
and	the	first	myth	is	if	you	try	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	you	can	live	to	be	100	.
false	.
the	problem	is	,	 on 	 ly 	 	about	one	out	of	5,000	people	in	america	live	to	be	100	.
your	 chance 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	low	.
even	 th 	 ough 	 	it	's	the	 fast 	 est 	 	growing	 demo 	 graphic 	 	in	america	,	it	's	hard	to	reach	100	.
the	problem	is	that	we	're	not	 programm 	 ed 	 	for	 long 	 ev 	 ity 	 	.
we	are	 programm 	 ed 	 	for	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 pro 	 creative 	 	success	.
i	love	that	word	.
it	 re 	 mind 	 s 	 	me	of	my	college	 day 	 s 	 	.
 biologist 	 s 	 	term	 pro 	 creative 	 	success	to	mean	the	age	where	you	have	children	and	then	 an 	 other 	 	generation	,	the	age	when	your	children	have	children	.
after	that	the	effect	of	evolution	 complete 	 ly 	 	 dissipate 	 s 	 	.
if	you	're	a	mammal	,	if	you	're	a	rat	or	an	elephant	,	or	a	human	,	in	between	,	it	's	the	same	story	.
so	to	make	it	to	age	100	,	you	not	 on 	 ly 	 	have	to	have	had	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 life 	 style 	 	,	you	 al 	 so 	 	have	to	have	won	the	genetic	 lot 	 ter 	 y 	 	.
the	second	myth	is	,	there	are	 treat 	 ments 	 	that	can	help	 s 	 low 	 	,	reverse	,	or	even	stop	aging	.
false	.
when	you	think	of	it	,	there	is	99	 thing 	 s 	 	that	can	age	us	.
 depriv 	 e 	 	your	brain	of	oxygen	for	just	a	few	 minute 	 s 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	brain	 cell 	 s 	 	die	,	they	never	come	back	.
play	tennis	too	hard	,	on	your	 knee 	 s 	 	,	ruin	your	 cart 	 il 	 age 	 	,	the	 cart 	 il 	 age 	 	never	 come 	 s 	 	back	.
our	 arteri 	 es 	 	can	clog	.	our	 brain 	 s 	 	can	 gun 	 k 	 	up	with	 pla 	 que 	 	,	and	we	can	get	alzheimer	's	.
there	is	just	too	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	to	go	wrong	.
our	bodies	have	35	trillion	 cell 	 s 	 	,
trillion	with	a	``	t.	``	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	national	debt	 number 	 s 	 	here	.
 t 	 hose 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	turn	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	over	once	every	eight	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	every	time	they	turn	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	over	there	is	some	damage	.	and	that	damage	 build 	 s 	 	up	.
and	it	 build 	 s 	 	up	 exponential 	 ly 	 	.
it	's	a	little	bit	like	the	 day 	 s 	 	when	we	all	had	beatles	 al 	 bum 	 s 	 	or	 eagle 	 s 	 	 al 	 bum 	 s 	 	and	we	'd	make	a	copy	of	that	on	a	cassette	tape	,	and	let	our	 friend 	 s 	 	copy	that	cassette	tape	,	and	 pre 	 tty 	 	soon	,	with	 success 	 ive 	 	 generation 	 s 	 	that	tape	 sound 	 s 	 	like	garbage	.
well	,	the	same	 thing 	 s 	 	happen	to	our	 cell 	 s 	 	.
that	's	why	a	65	-	year	-	old	person	is	aging	at	a	rate	of	about	125	 time 	 s 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	than	a	12	-	year	-	old	person	.
so	,	if	there	is	 noth 	 ing 	 	you	can	do	to	 s 	 low 	 	your	aging	or	stop	your	aging	,	what	am	i	 do 	 ing 	 	here	?
well	,	the	fact	of	the	matter	is	the	best	science	 tell 	 s 	 	us	that	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	of	the	human	body	,	my	body	,	your	body	,	is	about	90	 year 	 s 	 	,	a	little	bit	more	for	women	.
but	life	 expect 	 ancy 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	is	 on 	 ly 	 	78	.
so	 some 	 where 	 	 a 	 long 	 	the	line	,	we	're	 leav 	 ing 	 	about	12	good	 year 	 s 	 	on	the	table	.
these	are	 year 	 s 	 	that	we	could	get	.
and	research	 show 	 s 	 	that	they	would	be	 year 	 s 	 	 large 	 ly 	 	free	of	chronic	disease	,	heart	disease	,	cancer	and	diabetes	.
we	think	the	best	way	to	get	these	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	 year 	 s 	 	is	to	look	at	the	 culture 	 s 	 	around	the	world	that	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ex 	 peri 	 encing 	 	them	,	 area 	 s 	 	where	people	are	living	to	age	100	at	rates	up	to	10	 time 	 s 	 	 great 	 er 	 	than	we	are	,	 area 	 s 	 	where	the	life	 expect 	 ancy 	 	is	an	extra	dozen	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	rate	of	middle	age	 mortal 	 ity 	 	is	a	fraction	of	what	it	is	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	.
we	found	our	first	blue	zone	about	125	 mile 	 s 	 	off	the	coast	of	italy	,	on	the	 is 	 land 	 	of	sardinia	.
and	not	the	entire	 is 	 land 	 	,	the	 is 	 land 	 	is	about	1.4	million	people	,	but	 on 	 ly 	 	up	in	the	 high 	 land 	 s 	 	,	an	area	 call 	 ed 	 	the	nuoro	 pro 	 vince 	 	.
and	here	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	area	where	men	live	the	 long 	 est 	 	,	about	10	 time 	 s 	 	more	 centenarian 	 s 	 	than	we	have	here	in	america	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	place	where	people	not	 on 	 ly 	 	reach	age	100	,	they	do	so	with	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	vigor	.
 place 	 s 	 	where	102	year	olds	still	ride	 the 	 ir 	 	bike	to	work	,	chop	wood	,	and	can	beat	a	guy	60	 year 	 s 	 	 young 	 er 	 	than	them	.
 the 	 ir 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 go 	 es 	 	back	to	about	the	time	of	christ	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 bron 	 ze 	 	age	culture	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	 isolate 	 d 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	land	is	so	 infer 	 tile 	 	,	they	 large 	 ly 	 	are	 shepherd 	 s 	 	,	which	 occasion 	 s 	 	regular	,	low	-	 intens 	 ity 	 	physical	activity	.
 the 	 ir 	 	diet	is	 most 	 ly 	 	plant	-	based	,	 accent 	 u 	 ated 	 	with	 food 	 s 	 	that	they	can	carry	 in 	 to 	 	the	 field 	 s 	 	.
they	came	up	with	an	 un 	 leaven 	 ed 	 	whole	wheat	bread	 call 	 ed 	 	 cart 	 a 	 	 music 	 a 	 	made	out	of	 dur 	 um 	 	wheat	,	a	type	of	cheese	made	from	grass	-	fed	 animal 	 s 	 	so	the	cheese	is	high	in	 o 	 mega 	 	-	3	fatty	 acid 	 s 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 o 	 mega 	 	-	6	fatty	 acid 	 s 	 	from	corn	-	fed	 animal 	 s 	 	,	and	a	type	of	wine	that	 ha 	 s 	 	three	 time 	 s 	 	the	level	of	 poly 	 pheno 	 l 	 s 	 	than	any	known	wine	in	the	world	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	cannonau	.
but	the	real	secret	i	think	lies	more	in	the	way	that	they	organize	 the 	 ir 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
and	one	of	the	most	 s 	 al 	 ient 	 	 element 	 s 	 	of	the	sardinian	 socie 	 ty 	 	is	how	they	treat	 old 	 er 	 	people	.
you	ever	notice	here	in	america	,	social	 equ 	 ity 	 	 seem 	 s 	 	to	peak	at	about	age	24	?
just	look	at	the	 advertise 	 ments 	 	.
here	in	sardinia	,	the	 old 	 er 	 	you	get	the	more	 equ 	 ity 	 	you	have	,	the	more	 wis 	 dom 	 	you	're	 celebr 	 ated 	 	for	.
you	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	 bar 	 s 	 	in	sardinia	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 see 	 ing 	 	the	 s 	 port 	 s 	 	 illustr 	 ated 	 	 swim 	 suit 	 	calendar	,	you	see	the	centenarian	of	the	month	calendar	.
 th 	 is 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	is	not	 on 	 ly 	 	good	for	your	aging	 parent 	 s 	 	to	keep	them	close	to	the	family	--	it	 im 	 part 	 s 	 	about	four	to	six	 year 	 s 	 	of	extra	life	 expect 	 ancy 	 	--	research	 show 	 s 	 	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	good	for	the	children	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	,	who	have	lower	rates	of	 mortal 	 ity 	 	and	lower	rates	of	disease	.
that	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 grand 	 mother 	 	effect	.
we	found	our	second	blue	zone	on	the	other	side	of	the	planet	,	about	800	 mile 	 s 	 	south	of	tokyo	,	on	the	 arch 	 ipelago 	 	of	okinawa	.
okinawa	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	161	small	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	.
and	in	the	 north 	 ern 	 	part	of	the	main	 is 	 land 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	ground	zero	for	world	 long 	 ev 	 ity 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	place	where	the	 old 	 est 	 	living	female	population	is	found	.
it	's	a	place	where	people	have	the	 long 	 est 	 	 dis 	 ability 	 	-	free	life	 expect 	 ancy 	 	in	the	world	.	they	have	what	we	want	.
they	live	a	long	time	,	and	tend	to	die	in	 the 	 ir 	 	sleep	,
 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	and	often	,	i	can	tell	you	,	after	 s 	 ex 	 	.
they	live	about	seven	good	 year 	 s 	 	 long 	 er 	 	than	the	average	american	.
five	 time 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 centenarian 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	have	in	america	.
one	fifth	the	rate	of	colon	and	breast	cancer	,	big	 killer 	 s 	 	here	in	america	.
and	one	sixth	the	rate	of	 cardio 	 vascular 	 	disease	.
and	the	fact	that	 th 	 is 	 	culture	 ha 	 s 	 	 yield 	 ed 	 	these	 number 	 s 	 	 suggest 	 s 	 	 strong 	 ly 	 	they	have	 some 	 thing 	 	to	teach	us	.
what	do	they	do	?
once	 aga 	 in 	 	,	a	plant	-	based	diet	,	full	of	 veget 	 able 	 s 	 	with	 lot 	 s 	 	of	color	in	them	.
and	they	eat	about	eight	 time 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	 to 	 fu 	 	 a 	 s 	 	americans	do	.
more	significant	than	what	they	eat	is	how	they	eat	it	.
they	have	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	little	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	to	keep	from	 over 	 eating 	 	,	which	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	know	,	is	a	big	problem	here	in	america	.
a	few	of	the	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	we	 observ 	 ed 	 	:	they	eat	off	of	 small 	 er 	 	 plate 	 s 	 	,	so	they	tend	to	eat	 few 	 er 	 	 calorie 	 s 	 	at	every	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	 serv 	 ing 	 	family	style	,	where	you	can	sort	of	 mind 	 lessly 	 	eat	 a 	 s 	 	you	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	,	they	serve	at	the	counter	,	put	the	food	away	,	and	then	 br 	 ing 	 	it	to	the	table	.
they	 al 	 so 	 	have	a	3,000	-	year	-	old	 ad 	 age 	 	,	which	i	think	is	the	 great 	 est 	 	sort	of	diet	 suggest 	 ion 	 	ever	 invent 	 ed 	 	.
it	was	 invent 	 ed 	 	by	confucius	.
and	that	diet	is	known	 a 	 s 	 	the	hara	,	hatchi	,	bu	diet	.
it	's	 simpl 	 y 	 	a	little	 say 	 ing 	 	these	people	say	before	 the 	 ir 	 	meal	to	 re 	 mind 	 	them	to	stop	eating	when	 the 	 ir 	 	stomach	is	[	80	]	percent	full	.
it	 take 	 s 	 	about	a	half	hour	for	that	full	 feel 	 ing 	 	to	travel	from	your	 bel 	 ly 	 	to	your	brain	.
and	by	 remember 	 ing 	 	to	stop	at	80	percent	it	 help 	 s 	 	keep	you	from	 do 	 ing 	 	that	 ver 	 y 	 	thing	.
but	,	like	sardinia	,	okinawa	 ha 	 s 	 	a	few	social	 construct 	 s 	 	that	we	can	associate	with	 long 	 ev 	 ity 	 	.
we	know	that	 isol 	 ation 	 	 kill 	 s 	 	.
fifteen	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	the	average	american	had	three	good	 friend 	 s 	 	.
we	're	down	to	one	and	half	right	now	.
if	you	 we 	 re 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	to	be	born	in	okinawa	,	you	 we 	 re 	 	born	 in 	 to 	 	a	system	where	you	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	have	a	half	a	dozen	 friend 	 s 	 	with	whom	you	travel	through	life	.
they	call	it	a	moai	.	and	if	you	're	in	a	moai	you	're	 expect 	 ed 	 	to	share	the	bounty	if	you	 en 	 counter 	 	luck	,	and	if	 thing 	 s 	 	go	bad	,	child	 get 	 s 	 	sick	,	parent	dies	,	you	 al 	 ways 	 	have	 some 	 body 	 	who	 ha 	 s 	 	your	back	.
 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	moai	,	these	five	 lad 	 ies 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	together	for	97	 year 	 s 	 	.
 the 	 ir 	 	average	age	is	102	.
 typical 	 ly 	 	in	america	we	've	 divid 	 ed 	 	our	adult	life	up	 in 	 to 	 	two	 section 	 s 	 	.

in	the	okinawan	language	there	is	not	even	a	word	for	 retire 	 ment 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	there	is	one	word	that	 imbue 	 s 	 	your	entire	life	,	and	that	word	is	``	ikigai	.	``
and	,	 rough 	 ly 	 	 transl 	 ated 	 	,	it	 mean 	 s 	 	``	the	reason	for	which	you	wake	up	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	.	``

they	 celebr 	 ate 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	sabbath	from	 s 	 un 	 set 	 	on	friday	till	 s 	 un 	 set 	 	on	saturday	.
a	``	24	-	hour	 sanct 	 uary 	 	in	time	,	``	they	call	it	.

but	for	an	adventist	woman	,	 the 	 ir 	 	life	 expect 	 ancy 	 	is	89	.
and	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	is	even	more	 pronounce 	 d 	 	among	men	,	who	are	 expect 	 ed 	 	to	live	about	11	 year 	 s 	 	 long 	 er 	 	than	 the 	 ir 	 	american	 counter 	 part 	 s 	 	.

they	take	 the 	 ir 	 	diet	 direct 	 ly 	 	from	the	 b 	 ible 	 	.
genesis	:	chapter	one	,	verse	[	29	]	,	where	god	 talk 	 s 	 	about	 leg 	 ume 	 s 	 	and	 seed 	 s 	 	,	and	on	one	more	stanza	about	green	 plant 	 s 	 	,	 o 	 sten 	 s 	 ibly 	 	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	is	meat	.
they	take	 th 	 is 	 	 sanct 	 uary 	 	in	time	 ver 	 y 	 	serious	.
for	24	 hour 	 s 	 	every	week	,	no	matter	how	 bus 	 y 	 	they	are	,	how	 stress 	 ed 	 	out	they	are	at	work	,	where	the	 kid 	 s 	 	need	to	be	driven	,	they	stop	 every 	 thing 	 	and	they	focus	on	 the 	 ir 	 	god	,	 the 	 ir 	 	social	network	,	and	then	,	 hard 	 wired 	 	right	in	the	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	are	nature	 walk 	 s 	 	.
and	the	power	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	that	it	's	 d 	 one 	 	 occasion 	 ally 	 	,	the	power	is	it	's	 d 	 one 	 	every	week	for	a	 life 	 time 	 	.
 non 	 e 	 	of	it	's	hard	.	 non 	 e 	 	of	it	 cost 	 s 	 	money	.
adventists	 al 	 so 	 	tend	to	hang	out	with	other	adventists	.
so	,	if	you	go	to	an	adventist	's	party	you	do	n't	see	people	 s 	 will 	 ing 	 	jim	beam	or	 roll 	 ing 	 	a	joint	.
 in 	 stead 	 	they	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 the 	 ir 	 	next	nature	walk	,	 ex 	 changing 	 	 recipe 	 s 	 	,	and	 y 	 es 	 	,	they	pray	.
but	they	influence	each	other	in	 pro 	 found 	 	and	 measur 	 able 	 	ways	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	culture	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 yield 	 ed 	 	ellsworth	whareham	.
ellsworth	whareham	is	97	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
he	's	a	 multi 	 millionaire 	 	,	yet	when	a	 contract 	 or 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	6,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	build	a	 pri 	 vac 	 y 	 	 f 	 ence 	 	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	for	that	kind	of	money	i	'll	do	it	 my 	 self 	 	.	``
so	for	the	next	three	 day 	 s 	 	he	was	out	 shove 	 ling 	 	cement	,	and	 haul 	 ing 	 	 pole 	 s 	 	around	.
and	 predict 	 ably 	 	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	on	the	fourth	day	he	 end 	 ed 	 	up	in	the	 oper 	 ating 	 	room	.
but	not	 a 	 s 	 	the	guy	on	the	table	;	the	guy	 do 	 ing 	 	open	-	heart	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	.

``	a	 strange 	 r 	 	is	a	friend	i	have	n't	met	yet	!	``	she	'd	say	to	me	.
so	,	what	are	the	common	 denomi 	 nator 	 s 	 	in	these	three	 culture 	 s 	 	?
what	are	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	they	all	do	?
and	we	 manage 	 d 	 	to	boil	it	down	to	nine	.
in	fact	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	two	more	blue	zone	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 s 	 	since	 th 	 is 	 	and	these	common	 denomi 	 nator 	 s 	 	hold	true	.
and	the	first	one	,	and	i	'm	about	to	utter	a	 here 	 s 	 y 	 	here	,	 non 	 e 	 	of	them	 exercis 	 e 	 	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	the	way	we	think	of	 exercis 	 e 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	they	set	up	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	so	that	they	are	 constant 	 ly 	 	 nudge 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	physical	activity	.
these	100	-	year	-	old	okinawan	women	are	 get 	 ting 	 	up	and	down	off	the	ground	,	they	 s 	 it 	 	on	the	floor	,	30	or	40	 time 	 s 	 	a	day	.
sardinians	live	in	 vert 	 ical 	 	 house 	 s 	 	,	up	and	down	the	 stair 	 s 	 	.
every	trip	to	the	store	,	or	to	church	or	to	a	friend	's	house	 occasion 	 s 	 	a	walk	.
they	do	n't	have	any	 convenience 	 s 	 	.
there	is	not	a	button	to	push	to	do	yard	work	or	house	work	.
if	they	want	to	mix	up	a	cake	,	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	by	hand	.
that	's	physical	activity	.
that	 burn 	 s 	 	 calorie 	 s 	 	just	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	going	on	the	 tread 	 mill 	 	 do 	 es 	 	.
when	they	do	do	intentional	physical	activity	,	it	's	the	 thing 	 s 	 	they	enjoy	.	they	tend	to	walk	,	the	 on 	 ly 	 	proven	way	to	 stav 	 e 	 	off	cognitive	decline	,	and	they	all	tend	to	have	a	garden	.
they	know	how	to	set	up	 the 	 ir 	 	life	in	the	right	way	so	they	have	the	right	 out 	 look 	 	.
each	of	these	 culture 	 s 	 	take	time	to	 down 	 shift 	 	.
the	sardinians	pray	.	the	 seven 	 th 	 	-	day	adventists	pray	.
the	okinawans	have	 th 	 is 	 	 ance 	 s 	 tor 	 	 vene 	 ration 	 	.
but	when	you	're	in	a	 hur 	 ry 	 	or	 stress 	 ed 	 	out	,	that	 trigger 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 inflamm 	 atory 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	,	which	is	 associate 	 d 	 	with	 every 	 thing 	 	from	alzheimer	's	disease	to	 cardio 	 vascular 	 	disease	.
when	you	 s 	 low 	 	down	for	15	 minute 	 s 	 	a	day	you	turn	that	 inflamm 	 atory 	 	state	 in 	 to 	 	a	more	anti	-	 inflamm 	 atory 	 	state	.
they	have	 vocabul 	 ary 	 	for	sense	of	purpose	,	ikigai	,	like	the	okinawans	.
you	know	the	two	most	 danger 	 ous 	 	 year 	 s 	 	in	your	life	are	the	year	you	're	born	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	infant	 mortal 	 ity 	 	,	and	the	year	you	retire	.
these	people	know	 the 	 ir 	 	sense	of	purpose	,	and	they	activate	in	 the 	 ir 	 	life	,	that	's	worth	about	seven	 year 	 s 	 	of	extra	life	 expect 	 ancy 	 	.
there	's	no	 long 	 ev 	 ity 	 	diet	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	these	people	drink	a	little	bit	every	day	,	not	a	hard	sell	to	the	american	population	.
they	tend	to	eat	a	plant	-	based	diet	.
 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	they	do	n't	eat	meat	,	but	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 bean 	 s 	 	and	nuts	.
and	they	have	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	to	keep	from	 over 	 eating 	 	,	little	 thing 	 s 	 	that	nudge	them	away	from	the	table	at	the	right	time	.
and	then	the	 found 	 ation 	 	of	all	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	they	connect	.
they	put	 the 	 ir 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	first	,	take	care	of	 the 	 ir 	 	children	and	 the 	 ir 	 	aging	 parent 	 s 	 	.
they	all	tend	to	belong	to	a	faith	-	based	community	,	which	is	worth	between	four	and	14	extra	 year 	 s 	 	of	life	 expect 	 ancy 	 	if	you	do	it	four	 time 	 s 	 	a	month	.
and	the	 big 	 gest 	 	thing	here	is	they	 al 	 so 	 	belong	to	the	right	tribe	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	either	born	 in 	 to 	 	or	they	 pro 	 active 	 ly 	 	 surround 	 ed 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	with	the	right	people	.
we	know	from	the	framingham	 stud 	 ies 	 	,	that	if	your	three	best	 friend 	 s 	 	are	 obes 	 e 	 	there	is	a	50	percent	better	chance	that	you	'll	be	 over 	 weight 	 	.
so	,	if	you	hang	out	with	 un 	 health 	 y 	 	people	,	that	's	going	to	have	a	 measur 	 able 	 	impact	over	time	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	if	your	friend	's	idea	of	 re 	 creation 	 	is	physical	activity	,	 bowl 	 ing 	 	,	or	 play 	 ing 	 	 hoc 	 key 	 	,	 bi 	 king 	 	or	 garden 	 ing 	 	,	if	your	 friend 	 s 	 	drink	a	little	,	but	not	too	much	,	and	they	eat	right	,	and	they	're	 engag 	 ed 	 	,	and	they	're	 trust 	 ing 	 	and	 trust 	 worthy 	 	,	that	is	going	to	have	the	 big 	 gest 	 	impact	over	time	.
 diet 	 s 	 	do	n't	work	.	no	diet	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	the	world	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	 work 	 ed 	 	for	more	than	two	percent	of	the	population	.
 exercis 	 e 	 	 program 	 s 	 	 usual 	 ly 	 	start	in	january	;	they	're	 usual 	 ly 	 	 d 	 one 	 	by	october	.
when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	 long 	 ev 	 ity 	 	there	is	no	short	term	fix	in	a	pill	or	 any 	 thing 	 	else	.
but	when	you	think	about	it	,	your	 friend 	 s 	 	are	long	-	term	 adventure 	 s 	 	,	and	 there 	 fore 	 	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	the	most	significant	thing	you	can	do	to	add	more	 year 	 s 	 	to	your	life	,	and	life	to	your	 year 	 s 	 	.	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
