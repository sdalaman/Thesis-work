my	 favor 	 ite 	 	of	these	 photo 	 s 	 	,	which	i	could	n't	find	,	is	there	's	a	picture	of	a	30	year	-	old	woman	or	so	with	a	little	baby	on	her	lap	,	and	the	next	photo	is	a	220	-	lb	man	with	a	 tin 	 y 	 	,	little	old	 lad 	 y 	 	peaking	over	his	shoulder	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	project	 change 	 d 	 	the	way	that	i	thought	about	 connect 	 ing 	 	to	people	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	project	 call 	 ed 	 	ray	.
and	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	was	i	was	 s 	 ent 	 	 th 	 is 	 	piece	of	audio	and	had	no	idea	who	generated	the	audio	.
 some 	 body 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	have	to	listen	to	 th 	 is 	 	.	``
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	came	to	me	.
 record 	 ing 	 	:	hi	,	my	name	is	ray	,	and	on	 yester 	 day 	 	my	daughter	 call 	 ed 	 	me	 be 	 cause 	 	she	was	 stress 	 ed 	 	out	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	going	on	on	her	job	that	she	felt	was	 quit 	 e 	 	 un 	 fair 	 	.
 be 	 ing 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 disturb 	 ed 	 	,	she	 call 	 ed 	 	for	comfort	,	and	i	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	know	what	to	tell	her	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	to	deal	with	so	much	mess	in	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
so	i	was	led	to	write	 th 	 is 	 	song	just	for	her	,	just	to	give	her	some	 encourag 	 ement 	 	while	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	stress	and	 pressure 	 s 	 	on	her	job	.

ze	frank	:	so	--	 yea 	 h 	 	.
no	,	no	,	no	,	 s 	 hush 	 	.	we	've	got	to	go	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
so	i	was	so	 move 	 d 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	--
 th 	 is 	 	is	 in 	 credible 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	was	 connect 	 ing 	 	,	right	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	,	at	a	distance	,	 real 	 izing 	 	that	 some 	 one 	 	was	 feel 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	,	 want 	 ing 	 	to	affect	them	in	a	 part 	 icular 	 	way	,	using	media	to	do	it	,	 put 	 ting 	 	it	 on 	 line 	 	and	 real 	 izing 	 	that	there	was	a	 great 	 er 	 	impact	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	 in 	 credible 	 	;	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	.
so	the	first	thing	i	thought	of	is	we	have	to	thank	him	.
and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	my	audience	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	listen	to	 th 	 is 	 	piece	of	audio	.

and	have	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	with	it	.	``
 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 remix 	 es 	 	came	back	--	 lot 	 s 	 	of	different	 attempt 	 s 	 	.
one	stood	out	in	 part 	 icular 	 	.
it	was	 d 	 one 	 	by	a	guy	named	goose	.
remix	:	♫	i	'm	about	to	whip	 some 	 body 	 	's	ass	♫	♫	oh	,	i	'm	about	to	whip	 some 	 body 	 	's	ass	♫	♫	oh	,	if	you	do	n't	 leav 	 e 	 	me	 al 	 one 	 	,	♫	♫	you	gon	na	have	to	 s 	 end 	 	me	home	♫	♫	 cu 	 z 	 	i	'm	about	to	whip	 some 	 body 	 	's	ass	♫	♫	i	'm	about	to	whip	some	♫	--	zf	:	great	,	so	it	was	 in 	 credible 	 	.
that	song	--	thank	you	.
so	that	song	,	 some 	 body 	 	told	me	that	it	was	at	a	 base 	 ball 	 	game	in	kansas	city	.
in	the	end	,	it	was	one	of	the	top	 download 	 s 	 	on	a	whole	bunch	of	music	 stream 	 ing 	 	 service 	 s 	 	.
and	so	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	let	's	put	 th 	 is 	 	together	in	an	 al 	 bum 	 	.	``
and	the	audience	came	together	,	and	they	designed	an	 al 	 bum 	 	cover	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	if	you	put	it	all	on	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	'm	going	to	deliver	it	to	him	,	if	you	can	figure	out	who	 th 	 is 	 	person	is	,	``	 be 	 cause 	 	all	i	had	was	his	name	--	ray	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	little	piece	of	audio	and	the	fact	that	his	daughter	was	 up 	 set 	 	.
in	two	 week 	 s 	 	,	they	found	him	.
i	 receiv 	 ed 	 	and	email	and	it	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	hi	,	i	'm	ray	.
i	heard	you	 we 	 re 	 	looking	for	me	.	``
and	i	was	like	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	,	ray	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	two	 week 	 s 	 	.	``
and	so	i	flew	to	st.	louis	and	met	ray	,	and	he	's	a	 preach 	 er 	 	--
among	other	 thing 	 s 	 	.
so	but	 any 	 ways 	 	,	here	's	the	thing	--	is	it	 re 	 mind 	 s 	 	me	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	which	is	a	sign	that	you	see	in	amsterdam	on	every	street	corner	.
and	it	's	sort	of	a	metaphor	for	me	for	the	virtual	world	.
i	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	photo	,	and	he	 seem 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	what	's	going	on	with	that	button	,	but	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	seem	like	he	is	 re 	 ally 	 	that	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 cross 	 ing 	 	the	street	.
and	it	 make 	 s 	 	me	think	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
on	street	 corner 	 s 	 	 every 	 where 	 	,	people	are	looking	at	 the 	 ir 	 	cell	 phone 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	easy	to	dismiss	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	some	sort	of	bad	trend	in	human	culture	.
but	the	truth	is	life	is	 be 	 ing 	 	lived	there	.
when	they	 s 	 mile 	 	--	right	,	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	people	stop	--	all	of	a	sudden	,	life	is	 be 	 ing 	 	lived	there	,	 some 	 where 	 	up	in	that	weird	,	dense	network	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	it	,	right	,	to	feel	and	be	felt	.
it	's	the	fundamental	force	that	we	're	all	after	.
we	can	build	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 environment 	 s 	 	to	make	it	a	little	bit	 eas 	 ier 	 	,	but	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	what	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	is	 re 	 ally 	 	connect	with	one	other	person	.
and	that	's	not	 al 	 ways 	 	going	to	happen	in	physical	 space 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	going	to	now	happen	in	virtual	 space 	 s 	 	,	and	we	have	to	get	better	at	 figur 	 ing 	 	that	out	.
i	think	,	of	the	people	that	build	all	 th 	 is 	 	technology	in	the	network	,	a	lot	of	them	are	n't	 ver 	 y 	 	good	at	 connect 	 ing 	 	with	people	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	kind	of	like	 some 	 thing 	 	i	used	to	do	in	third	grade	.
so	here	's	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 project 	 s 	 	over	the	last	few	 year 	 s 	 	where	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	inspired	by	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	how	to	 re 	 ally 	 	facilitate	close	 connect 	 ion 	 	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 thing 	 s 	 	.
a	 child 	 hood 	 	walk	,	which	is	a	project	where	i	ask	people	to	remember	a	walk	that	they	used	to	take	 a 	 s 	 	a	child	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	that	was	sort	of	 meaning 	 less 	 	--	like	on	the	route	to	the	bus	stop	,	to	a	neighbor	's	house	,	and	take	it	 in 	 side 	 	of	google	streetview	.
and	i	promise	you	,	if	you	take	that	walk	 in 	 side 	 	google	streetview	,	you	come	to	a	moment	where	 some 	 thing 	 	 come 	 s 	 	back	and	 hit 	 s 	 	you	in	the	face	.
and	i	 collect 	 ed 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 moment 	 s 	 	--	the	 photo 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	google	streetview	and	the	 memor 	 ies 	 	,	 specific 	 ally 	 	.
``	our	conversation	 start 	 ed 	 	with	me	 say 	 ing 	 	,	'	i	'm	 bor 	 ed 	 	,	'	and	her	 re 	 ply 	 ing 	 	,	'	when	i	'm	 bor 	 ed 	 	i	eat	 pretzel 	 s 	 	.	'	i	remember	 th 	 is 	 	 distinct 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	came	up	a	lot	.	``
``	right	after	he	told	me	and	my	brother	he	was	going	to	be	 separat 	 ing 	 	from	my	mom	,	i	remember	 walk 	 ing 	 	to	a	convenience	store	and	 get 	 ting 	 	a	 cher 	 ry 	 	 col 	 a 	 	.	``
``	they	used	some	of	the	 morbid 	 ly 	 	artist	 foot 	 age 	 	,	a	close	-	up	of	chad	's	 shoe 	 s 	 	in	the	middle	of	the	 high 	 way 	 	.
i	guess	the	 shoe 	 s 	 	came	off	when	he	was	hit	.
he	slept	over	at	my	house	once	,	and	he	left	his	 pil 	 low 	 	.
it	had	'	chad	'	written	in	magic	marker	on	it	.
he	 di 	 ed 	 	long	after	he	left	the	 pil 	 low 	 	at	my	house	,	but	we	never	got	around	to	 return 	 ing 	 	it	.	``
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	they	're	a	little	bit	more	abstract	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	pain	pack	.
right	after	september	11th	,	last	year	,	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	about	pain	and	the	way	that	we	 dispers 	 e 	 	it	,	the	way	that	we	 ex 	 cise 	 	it	from	our	bodies	.
so	what	i	did	is	i	 open 	 ed 	 	up	a	 hot 	 line 	 	--	a	 hot 	 line 	 	where	people	could	 leav 	 e 	 	 voice 	 mail 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	pain	,	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	related	to	that	event	.
and	people	 call 	 ed 	 	in	and	left	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.	 record 	 ing 	 	:	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	here	's	 some 	 thing 	 	.
i	'm	not	 al 	 one 	 	,	and	i	am	 love 	 d 	 	.
i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	fortunate	.
but	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	i	feel	 re 	 ally 	 	 lone 	 ly 	 	.
and	when	i	feel	that	way	even	the	 small 	 est 	 	act	of	 kind 	 ness 	 	can	make	me	cry	.
like	even	people	in	convenience	 store 	 s 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	have	a	nice	day	,	``	when	they	're	 accident 	 ally 	 	looking	me	in	the	eye	.
zf	:	so	what	i	did	was	i	took	 t 	 hose 	 	 voice 	 mail 	 s 	 	,	and	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 per 	 mission 	 	,	 convert 	 ed 	 	them	to	mp	3s	and	 distribut 	 ed 	 	them	to	sound	 editor 	 s 	 	who	 create 	 d 	 	short	 sound 	 s 	 	using	just	 t 	 hose 	 	 voice 	 mail 	 s 	 	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	 we 	 re 	 	then	 distribut 	 ed 	 	to	djs	who	have	made	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 song 	 s 	 	using	that	source	material	.
we	do	n't	have	time	to	play	much	of	it	.
you	can	look	at	it	 on 	 line 	 	.
``	from	52	to	48	with	love	``	was	a	project	around	the	time	of	the	last	election	cycle	,	where	mccain	and	obama	both	,	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 speech 	 es 	 	after	the	election	,	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	 reconcili 	 ation 	 	,	and	i	was	like	,	``	what	the	hell	 do 	 es 	 	that	look	like	?	``
so	i	thought	,	``	well	let	's	just	give	it	a	try	.
let	's	have	people	hold	up	 sign 	 s 	 	about	 reconcili 	 ation 	 	.	``
and	so	some	 re 	 ally 	 	nice	 thing 	 s 	 	came	together	.
``	i	 vot 	 ed 	 	blue	.	i	 vot 	 ed 	 	red	.
together	,	for	our	future	.	``
these	are	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	cute	little	 thing 	 s 	 	right	.
some	came	from	the	winning	party	.
``	dear	48	,	i	promise	to	listen	to	you	,	to	fight	for	you	,	to	respect	you	 al 	 ways 	 	.	``
some	came	from	the	party	who	had	just	lost	.
``	from	a	48	to	a	52	,	may	your	party	's	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	be	 a 	 s 	 	 class 	 y 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	,	but	i	doubt	it	.	``
but	the	truth	was	that	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	start	 be 	 coming 	 	popular	,	a	couple	 right 	 wing 	 	 blog 	 s 	 	and	some	 mess 	 age 	 	 board 	 s 	 	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	found	it	to	be	a	little	 patron 	 izing 	 	,	which	i	could	 al 	 so 	 	see	.
and	so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 amount 	 s 	 	of	hate	mail	,	death	 threat 	 s 	 	even	.
and	one	guy	in	 part 	 icular 	 	 ke 	 pt 	 	on	writing	me	these	 pre 	 tty 	 	awful	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	,	and	he	was	 dress 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	batman	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'm	 dress 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	batman	to	hide	my	 ident 	 ity 	 	.	``
just	in	case	i	thought	the	real	batman	was	coming	after	me	;
which	 actual 	 ly 	 	made	me	feel	a	little	better	--
like	,	``	 p 	 hew 	 	,	it	's	not	him	.	``
so	what	i	did	--	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	i	was	 harbor 	 ing 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	awful	experience	and	 th 	 is 	 	pain	 in 	 side 	 	of	me	,	and	it	 start 	 ed 	 	to	eat	away	at	my	 psych 	 e 	 	.
and	i	was	 protect 	 ing 	 	the	project	from	it	,	i	 real 	 ized 	 	.	i	was	 protect 	 ing 	 	it	--
i	did	n't	want	 th 	 is 	 	special	,	little	group	of	 photograph 	 s 	 	to	get	sullied	in	some	way	.
so	what	i	did	,	i	took	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 email 	 s 	 	,	and	i	put	them	together	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	angrigami	,	which	was	an	origami	template	made	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	 vil 	 e 	 	stuff	.
and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	people	to	 s 	 end 	 	me	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	made	out	of	the	angrigami	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	 emotion 	 al 	 	moment	.
one	of	my	 view 	 er 	 	's	 uncle 	 s 	 	 di 	 ed 	 	on	a	 part 	 icular 	 	day	and	he	chose	to	 commemo 	 rate 	 	it	with	a	piece	of	hate	.
it	's	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
the	last	thing	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	about	is	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 project 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 song 	 s 	 	you	 al 	 ready 	 	know	,	where	the	idea	was	,	i	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	to	address	 part 	 icular 	 	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 emotion 	 s 	 	with	group	 project 	 s 	 	.
so	one	of	them	was	 fair 	 ly 	 	 straight 	 forward 	 	.
a	guy	 s 	 aid 	 	that	his	daughter	got	 scar 	 ed 	 	at	night	and	could	i	write	a	song	for	her	,	his	daughter	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	oh	 yea 	 h 	 	,	i	'll	try	to	write	a	 man 	 tra 	 	that	she	can	 s 	 ing 	 	to	 her 	 self 	 	to	help	 her 	 self 	 	go	to	sleep	.	``
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	``	 scar 	 ed 	 	.	``
♫	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	song	that	i	 s 	 ing 	 	when	i	'm	 scar 	 ed 	 	of	 some 	 thing 	 	♫	♫	i	do	n't	know	why	but	it	 help 	 s 	 	me	get	over	it	♫	♫	the	 word 	 s 	 	of	the	song	just	move	me	 a 	 long 	 	♫	♫	and	 some 	 how 	 	i	get	over	it	♫	♫	at	 l 	 east 	 	i	do	n't	suck	at	life	♫	♫	i	keep	on	 try 	 ing 	 	 de 	 spite 	 	♫	♫	at	 l 	 east 	 	i	do	n't	suck	at	life	♫	♫	i	keep	on	 try 	 ing 	 	 de 	 spite 	 	♫	♫	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	song	that	i	 s 	 ing 	 	when	i	'm	 scar 	 ed 	 	of	 some 	 thing 	 	♫	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	i	wrote	that	song	,	right	.	thank	you	.
so	the	nice	thing	was	is	he	 walk 	 ed 	 	by	his	daughter	's	room	at	some	point	,	and	she	 actual 	 ly 	 	was	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	that	song	to	 her 	 self 	 	.
so	i	was	like	,	``	awesome	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	great	.	``
and	then	i	got	 th 	 is 	 	email	.	and	there	's	a	little	bit	of	a	back	story	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	i	do	n't	have	much	time	.
but	the	idea	was	that	at	one	point	i	did	a	project	 call 	 ed 	 	facebook	me	 equal 	 s 	 	you	,	where	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	experience	what	it	was	like	to	live	 a 	 s 	 	 an 	 other 	 	person	.
so	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	for	people	's	 user 	 name 	 s 	 	and	 pass 	 word 	 s 	 	to	be	 s 	 ent 	 	to	me	.
and	i	got	a	lot	,	like	30	in	a	half	an	hour	.
and	i	shut	that	part	down	.
and	i	chose	two	people	to	be	,	and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	to	 s 	 end 	 	me	 de 	 script 	 ions 	 	of	how	to	act	 a 	 s 	 	them	on	facebook	.
one	person	 s 	 ent 	 	me	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 detail 	 ed 	 	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	;
the	other	person	did	n't	.
and	the	person	who	did	n't	,	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	,	had	just	 move 	 d 	 	to	a	new	city	and	taken	on	a	new	job	.
so	,	you	know	,	people	 we 	 re 	 	writing	me	and	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	how	's	your	new	job	?	``
i	was	like	,	``	i	do	n't	know	.
did	n't	know	i	had	one	.	``
but	 any 	 way 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	same	person	,	laura	,	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 email 	 ing 	 	me	a	little	bit	after	that	project	.
and	i	felt	 bad 	 ly 	 	for	not	 hav 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	a	good	job	.
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 anx 	 ious 	 	,	i	just	 move 	 d 	 	to	a	new	town	,	i	have	 th 	 is 	 	new	job	,	and	i	've	just	had	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	amount	of	 anxie 	 ty 	 	.	``
so	she	had	 s 	 een 	 	the	``	 scar 	 ed 	 	``	song	and	 wonder 	 ed 	 	if	i	could	do	 some 	 thing 	 	.
so	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	her	,	``	what	 do 	 es 	 	it	feel	like	when	you	feel	 th 	 is 	 	way	?	``
and	she	wrote	a	sort	of	 de 	 script 	 ive 	 	set	of	what	it	felt	like	to	have	had	 th 	 is 	 	 anxie 	 ty 	 	.
and	so	what	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	do	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	i	'll	think	about	it	.	``
and	so	 quiet 	 ly 	 	in	the	 back 	 ground 	 	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	people	 th 	 is 	 	.
♫	 he 	 y 	 	♫	♫	you	're	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	♫	♫	you	'll	be	fine	♫	so	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	people	 whet 	 her 	 	they	had	 bas 	 ic 	 	audio	 cap 	 abilities 	 	,	just	so	they	could	 s 	 ing 	 	 a 	 long 	 	to	the	song	with	 head 	 phone 	 s 	 	on	,	so	i	could	just	get	 the 	 ir 	 	 voice 	 s 	 	back	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	kind	of	thing	that	i	got	back	.
 record 	 ing 	 	:	♫	 he 	 y 	 	♫	♫	you	're	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	♫	♫	you	'll	be	fine	♫	zf	:	so	that	's	one	of	the	better	 one 	 s 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	.
