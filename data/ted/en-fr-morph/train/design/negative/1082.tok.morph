i	admit	that	i	'm	a	little	bit	nervous	here	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	going	to	say	some	radical	 thing 	 s 	 	,	about	how	we	should	think	about	cancer	 different 	 ly 	 	,	to	an	audience	that	 contain 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	people	who	know	a	lot	more	about	cancer	than	i	do	.
but	i	will	 al 	 so 	 	contest	that	i	'm	not	 a 	 s 	 	nervous	 a 	 s 	 	i	should	be	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	 pre 	 tty 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	i	'm	right	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	that	 th 	 is 	 	,	in	fact	,	will	be	the	way	that	we	treat	cancer	in	the	future	.
in	order	to	talk	about	cancer	,	i	'm	going	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	to	--	let	me	get	the	big	slide	here	.
first	,	i	'm	going	to	try	to	give	you	a	different	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	of	 genomic 	 s 	 	.
i	want	to	put	it	in	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	of	the	 big 	 ger 	 	picture	of	all	the	other	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	going	on	--	and	then	talk	about	 some 	 thing 	 	you	have	n't	heard	so	much	about	,	which	is	 proteo 	 mic 	 s 	 	.	 hav 	 ing 	 	 explain 	 ed 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	,	that	will	set	up	for	what	i	think	will	be	a	different	idea	about	how	to	go	about	 treat 	 ing 	 	cancer	.
so	let	me	start	with	 genomic 	 s 	 	.
it	is	the	hot	 top 	 ic 	 	.
it	is	the	place	where	we	're	 learn 	 ing 	 	the	most	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	great	 front 	 ier 	 	.
but	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 limit 	 ations 	 	.
and	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	you	've	 prob 	 ably 	 	all	heard	the	 analog 	 y 	 	that	the	genome	is	like	the	 blue 	 print 	 	of	your	body	,
and	if	that	 we 	 re 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	true	,	it	would	be	great	,	but	it	's	not	.
it	's	like	the	 part 	 s 	 	list	of	your	body	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	say	how	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 connect 	 ed 	 	,	what	 cause 	 s 	 	what	and	so	on	.
so	if	i	can	make	an	 analog 	 y 	 	,	let	's	say	that	you	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	tell	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	a	good	restaurant	,	a	 health 	 y 	 	restaurant	and	a	sick	restaurant	,	and	all	you	had	was	the	list	of	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	that	they	had	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 lar 	 der 	 	.
so	it	might	be	that	,	if	you	went	to	a	french	restaurant	and	you	 look 	 ed 	 	through	it	and	you	found	they	 on 	 ly 	 	had	 mar 	 gar 	 ine 	 	and	they	did	n't	have	butter	,	you	could	say	,	``	ah	,	i	see	what	's	wrong	with	them	.	i	can	make	them	 health 	 y 	 	.	``
and	there	 prob 	 ably 	 	are	special	 case 	 s 	 	of	that	.
you	could	 certain 	 ly 	 	tell	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	a	chinese	restaurant	and	a	french	restaurant	by	what	they	had	in	a	 lar 	 der 	 	.
so	the	list	of	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	 do 	 es 	 	tell	you	 some 	 thing 	 	,	and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	it	 tell 	 s 	 	you	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	wrong	.
if	they	have	 ton 	 s 	 	of	salt	,	you	might	guess	they	're	using	too	much	salt	,	or	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
but	it	's	 limit 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	to	know	if	it	's	a	 health 	 y 	 	restaurant	,	you	need	to	taste	the	food	,	you	need	to	know	what	 go 	 es 	 	on	in	the	kitchen	,	you	need	the	product	of	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	.
so	if	i	look	at	a	person	and	i	look	at	a	person	's	genome	,	it	's	the	same	thing	.
the	part	of	the	genome	that	we	can	read	is	the	list	of	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	.
and	so	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	there	are	 time 	 s 	 	when	we	can	find	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	that	[	are	]	bad	.
cystic	 fibro 	 sis 	 	is	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	a	disease	where	you	just	have	a	bad	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 	and	you	have	a	disease	,	and	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	make	a	direct	 correspond 	 ence 	 	between	the	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 	and	the	disease	.
but	most	 thing 	 s 	 	,	you	 re 	 ally 	 	have	to	know	what	's	going	on	in	the	kitchen	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 most 	 ly 	 	,	sick	people	used	to	be	 health 	 y 	 	people	--	they	have	the	same	genome	.
so	the	genome	 re 	 ally 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	you	much	more	about	 pre 	 dis 	 position 	 	.
so	what	you	can	tell	is	you	can	tell	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	an	asian	person	and	a	european	person	by	looking	at	 the 	 ir 	 	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	list	.
but	you	 re 	 ally 	 	for	the	most	part	ca	n't	tell	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	a	 health 	 y 	 	person	and	a	sick	person	--	 ex 	 cept 	 	in	some	of	these	special	 case 	 s 	 	.
so	why	all	the	big	deal	about	 genetic 	 s 	 	?
well	first	of	all	,	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	we	can	read	it	,	which	is	fantastic	.
it	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	in	certain	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	the	great	 theoretic 	 al 	 	triumph	of	biology	.	it	's	the	one	 theor 	 y 	 	that	the	 biologist 	 s 	 	ever	 re 	 ally 	 	got	right	.
it	's	fundamental	to	darwin	and	mendel	and	so	on	.
and	so	it	's	the	one	thing	where	they	 predict 	 ed 	 	a	 theoretic 	 al 	 	construct	.
so	mendel	had	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	a	gene	 a 	 s 	 	an	abstract	thing	,
and	darwin	built	a	whole	 theor 	 y 	 	that	 depend 	 ed 	 	on	them	 exist 	 ing 	 	,
and	then	watson	and	crick	 actual 	 ly 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	and	found	one	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	in	physics	all	the	time	.
you	predict	a	black	hole	,	and	you	look	out	the	 tele 	 scope 	 	and	there	it	is	,	just	like	you	 s 	 aid 	 	.
but	it	 rare 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	in	biology	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	great	triumph	--	it	's	so	good	,	there	's	 al 	 most 	 	a	religious	experience	in	biology	.
and	darwinian	evolution	is	 re 	 ally 	 	the	core	 theor 	 y 	 	.
so	the	other	reason	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	popular	is	 be 	 cause 	 	we	can	measure	it	,	it	's	digital	.
and	in	fact	,	 thank 	 s 	 	to	kary	mullis	,	you	can	 bas 	 ically 	 	measure	your	genome	in	your	kitchen	with	a	few	extra	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	.
so	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	by	 measur 	 ing 	 	the	genome	,	we	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	a	lot	about	how	we	're	related	to	other	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 animal 	 s 	 	by	the	 close 	 ness 	 	of	our	genome	,	or	how	we	're	related	to	each	other	--	the	family	tree	,	or	the	tree	of	life	.
there	's	a	huge	amount	of	information	about	the	 genetic 	 s 	 	just	by	 compar 	 ing 	 	the	genetic	 similar 	 ity 	 	.
now	of	course	,	in	medical	application	,	that	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	the	same	kind	of	information	that	the	doctor	 get 	 s 	 	from	your	family	medical	 histo 	 ry 	 	--	 ex 	 cept 	 	 prob 	 ably 	 	,	your	genome	 know 	 s 	 	much	more	about	your	medical	 histo 	 ry 	 	than	you	do	.
and	so	by	 read 	 ing 	 	the	genome	,	we	can	find	out	much	more	about	your	family	than	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	know	.
and	so	we	can	discover	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 prob 	 ably 	 	you	could	have	found	by	looking	at	 en 	 ough 	 	of	your	 relat 	 ive 	 s 	 	,	but	they	may	be	surprising	.
i	did	the	23andme	thing	and	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 surprise 	 d 	 	to	discover	that	i	am	fat	and	bald	.
but	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	you	can	learn	much	more	 use 	 ful 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	about	that	.
but	 most 	 ly 	 	what	you	need	to	know	,	to	find	out	if	you	're	sick	,	is	not	your	 pre 	 dis 	 position 	 s 	 	,	but	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	what	's	going	on	in	your	body	right	now	.
so	to	do	that	,	what	you	 re 	 ally 	 	need	to	do	,	you	need	to	look	at	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	the	 gene 	 s 	 	are	producing	and	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	after	the	 genetic 	 s 	 	,
and	that	's	what	 proteo 	 mic 	 s 	 	is	about	.
just	like	genome	 mix 	 es 	 	the	 stud 	 y 	 	of	all	the	 gene 	 s 	 	,	 proteo 	 mic 	 s 	 	is	the	 stud 	 y 	 	of	all	the	 protein 	 s 	 	.
and	the	 protein 	 s 	 	are	all	of	the	little	 thing 	 s 	 	in	your	body	that	are	 signal 	 ing 	 	between	the	 cell 	 s 	 	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	the	 machine 	 s 	 	that	are	 oper 	 ating 	 	--
that	's	where	the	action	is	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	,	a	human	body	is	a	conversation	going	on	,	both	 with 	 in 	 	the	 cell 	 s 	 	and	between	the	 cell 	 s 	 	,	and	they	're	 tell 	 ing 	 	each	other	to	grow	and	to	die	,
and	when	you	're	sick	,	 some 	 thing 	 	's	gone	wrong	with	that	conversation	.
and	so	the	trick	is	--	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	we	do	n't	have	an	easy	way	to	measure	these	like	we	can	measure	the	genome	.
so	the	problem	is	that	 measur 	 ing 	 	--	if	you	try	to	measure	all	the	 protein 	 s 	 	,	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	elaborate	process	.
it	 requir 	 es 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 step 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 take 	 s 	 	a	long	,	long	time	.
and	it	 matter 	 s 	 	how	much	of	the	protein	it	is	.
it	could	be	 ver 	 y 	 	significant	that	a	protein	 change 	 d 	 	by	10	percent	,	so	it	's	not	a	nice	digital	thing	like	dna	.
and	 bas 	 ically 	 	our	problem	is	 some 	 body 	 	's	in	the	middle	of	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	long	stage	,	they	pause	for	just	a	moment	,	and	they	 leav 	 e 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	in	an	enzyme	for	a	second	,	and	all	of	a	sudden	all	the	 measure 	 ments 	 	from	then	on	do	n't	work	.
and	so	then	people	get	 ver 	 y 	 	 in 	 consist 	 ent 	 	 result 	 s 	 	when	they	do	it	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
people	have	 tri 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	 tri 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	a	couple	of	 time 	 s 	 	and	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	problem	and	 g 	 ave 	 	up	on	it	.
i	 ke 	 pt 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 th 	 is 	 	call	from	 th 	 is 	 	 onco 	 logist 	 	named	david	agus	.
and	 appli 	 ed 	 	 mind 	 s 	 	 get 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	 call 	 s 	 	from	people	who	want	help	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	,	and	i	did	n't	think	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 like 	 ly 	 	one	to	call	back	,	so	i	 ke 	 pt 	 	on	giving	him	to	the	delay	list	.
and	then	one	day	,	i	get	a	call	from	john	doerr	,	bill	berkman	and	al	gore	on	the	same	day	 say 	 ing 	 	return	david	agus	's	phone	call	.
so	i	was	like	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	guy	's	at	 l 	 east 	 	 resource 	 ful 	 	.	``
so	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	 re 	 ally 	 	need	a	better	way	to	measure	 protein 	 s 	 	.	``
i	'm	like	,	``	 look 	 ed 	 	at	that	.	 be 	 en 	 	there	.
not	going	to	be	easy	.	``
he	's	like	,	``	no	,	no	.	i	 re 	 ally 	 	need	it	.
i	mean	,	i	see	 patient 	 s 	 	 dy 	 ing 	 	every	day	 be 	 cause 	 	we	do	n't	know	what	's	going	on	 in 	 side 	 	of	them	.
we	have	to	have	a	window	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.	``
and	he	took	me	through	specific	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	when	he	 re 	 ally 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	it	.
and	i	 real 	 ized 	 	,	 w 	 ow 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	would	 re 	 ally 	 	make	a	big	 differ 	 ence 	 	,	if	we	could	do	it	,
and	so	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	let	's	look	at	it	.	``
 appli 	 ed 	 	 mind 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	play	money	that	we	can	go	and	just	work	on	 some 	 thing 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 any 	 body 	 	's	 fund 	 ing 	 	or	 per 	 mission 	 	or	 any 	 thing 	 	.
so	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	around	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	we	did	it	,	we	 real 	 ized 	 	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	problem	--	that	taking	the	 s 	 ip 	 	of	coffee	--	that	there	 we 	 re 	 	 human 	 s 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	process	and	that	what	 re 	 ally 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	to	be	 d 	 one 	 	was	to	 autom 	 ate 	 	 th 	 is 	 	process	like	an	 assem 	 bly 	 	line	and	build	 robot 	 s 	 	that	would	measure	 proteo 	 mic 	 s 	 	.
and	so	we	did	that	,
and	 work 	 ing 	 	with	david	,	we	made	a	little	company	 call 	 ed 	 	 appli 	 ed 	 	 proteo 	 mic 	 s 	 	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	which	 make 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	robotic	 assem 	 bly 	 	line	,	which	,	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 consist 	 ent 	 	way	,	 measure 	 s 	 	the	protein	.
and	i	'll	show	you	what	that	protein	 measure 	 ment 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	,	what	we	do	is	we	take	a	drop	of	blood	out	of	a	patient	,	and	we	sort	out	the	 protein 	 s 	 	in	the	drop	of	blood	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	how	much	they	weigh	,	how	 slip 	 per 	 y 	 	they	are	,	and	we	arrange	them	in	an	image	.
and	so	we	can	look	at	 liter 	 ally 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 feature 	 s 	 	at	once	out	of	that	drop	of	blood	.
and	we	can	take	a	different	one	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	,	and	you	will	see	your	 protein 	 s 	 	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	will	be	different	--	they	'll	be	different	after	you	eat	or	after	you	sleep	.
they	 re 	 ally 	 	tell	us	what	's	going	on	there	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	picture	,	which	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	big	 smudg 	 e 	 	to	you	,	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	thing	that	got	me	 re 	 ally 	 	 thrill 	 ed 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	and	made	me	feel	like	we	 we 	 re 	 	on	the	right	track	.
so	if	i	zoom	 in 	 to 	 	that	picture	,	i	can	just	show	you	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	.
we	sort	out	the	 protein 	 s 	 	--	from	left	to	right	is	the	weight	of	the	 fragment 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 get 	 ting 	 	,
and	from	top	to	bottom	is	how	 slip 	 per 	 y 	 	they	are	.
so	we	're	 zoom 	 ing 	 	in	here	just	to	show	you	a	little	bit	of	it	.
and	so	each	of	these	lines	 represent 	 s 	 	some	signal	that	we	're	 get 	 ting 	 	out	of	a	piece	of	a	protein	.
and	you	can	see	how	the	lines	occur	in	these	little	 group 	 s 	 	of	bump	,	bump	,	bump	,	bump	,	bump	.
and	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	 measur 	 ing 	 	the	weight	so	 precise 	 ly 	 	that	--	carbon	 come 	 s 	 	in	different	 isotope 	 s 	 	,	so	if	it	 ha 	 s 	 	an	extra	neutron	on	it	,	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	measure	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	different	chemical	.
so	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 measur 	 ing 	 	each	isotope	 a 	 s 	 	a	different	one	.
and	so	that	 give 	 s 	 	you	an	idea	of	how	 exquisite 	 ly 	 	sensitive	 th 	 is 	 	is	.
so	 see 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	picture	is	sort	of	like	 get 	 ting 	 	to	be	galileo	and	looking	at	the	 star 	 s 	 	and	looking	through	the	 tele 	 scope 	 	for	the	first	time	,	and	 sudden 	 ly 	 	you	say	,	``	 w 	 ow 	 	,	it	's	way	more	 complic 	 ated 	 	than	we	thought	it	was	.	``
but	we	can	see	that	stuff	out	there	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	 feature 	 s 	 	of	it	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	signature	out	of	which	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	 pattern 	 s 	 	.
so	what	we	do	with	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	we	can	look	at	two	 patient 	 s 	 	,	one	that	 respond 	 ed 	 	to	a	drug	and	one	that	did	n't	respond	to	a	drug	,
and	ask	,	``	what	's	going	on	 different 	 ly 	 	 in 	 side 	 	of	them	?	``
and	so	we	can	make	these	 measure 	 ments 	 	 precise 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	that	we	can	 over 	 lay 	 	two	 patient 	 s 	 	and	look	at	the	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	.
so	here	we	have	alice	in	green	and	bob	in	red	.
we	 over 	 lay 	 	them	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	actual	data	.
and	you	can	see	,	 most 	 ly 	 	it	 over 	 lap 	 s 	 	and	it	's	yellow	,	but	there	's	some	 thing 	 s 	 	that	just	alice	 ha 	 s 	 	and	some	 thing 	 s 	 	that	just	bob	 ha 	 s 	 	.
and	if	we	find	a	pattern	of	 thing 	 s 	 	of	the	 respond 	 ers 	 	to	the	drug	,	we	see	that	in	the	blood	,	they	have	the	condition	that	 allow 	 s 	 	them	to	respond	to	 th 	 is 	 	drug	.
we	might	not	even	know	what	 th 	 is 	 	protein	is	,	but	we	can	see	it	's	a	marker	for	the	 respons 	 e 	 	to	the	disease	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	,	i	think	,	is	 tremendous 	 ly 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	in	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	medicine	.
but	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	just	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	how	we	're	going	to	treat	cancer	.
so	let	me	move	to	cancer	.
the	thing	about	cancer	--	when	i	got	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 k 	 new 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	about	it	,	but	 work 	 ing 	 	with	david	agus	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	how	cancer	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 treat 	 ed 	 	and	went	to	 operation 	 s 	 	where	it	was	 be 	 ing 	 	cut	out	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	it	,	to	me	it	did	n't	make	sense	how	we	 we 	 re 	 	 approach 	 ing 	 	cancer	,
and	in	order	to	make	sense	of	it	,	i	had	to	learn	where	did	 th 	 is 	 	come	from	.
we	're	 treat 	 ing 	 	cancer	 al 	 most 	 	like	it	's	an	 infect 	 ious 	 	disease	.
we	're	 treat 	 ing 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	got	 in 	 side 	 	of	you	that	we	have	to	kill	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	great	paradigm	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	case	where	a	 theoretic 	 al 	 	paradigm	in	biology	 re 	 ally 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	--	was	the	germ	 theor 	 y 	 	of	disease	.
so	what	 doctor 	 s 	 	are	 most 	 ly 	 	trained	to	do	is	 diagnos 	 e 	 	--	that	is	,	put	you	 in 	 to 	 	a	 categor 	 y 	 	and	 app 	 ly 	 	a	 scientific 	 ally 	 	proven	 treat 	 ment 	 	for	that	 diagnos 	 is 	 	--
and	that	 work 	 s 	 	great	for	 infect 	 ious 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	.
so	if	we	put	you	in	the	 categor 	 y 	 	of	you	've	got	syphilis	,	we	can	give	you	 pen 	 icillin 	 	.
we	know	that	that	 work 	 s 	 	.
if	you	've	got	malaria	,	we	give	you	 qui 	 nine 	 	or	some	 deriv 	 ative 	 	of	it	.
and	so	that	's	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	thing	 doctor 	 s 	 	are	trained	to	do	,
and	it	's	 miracul 	 ous 	 	in	the	case	of	 infect 	 ious 	 	disease	--	how	well	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
and	 man 	 y 	 	people	in	 th 	 is 	 	audience	 prob 	 ably 	 	would	n't	be	 al 	 ive 	 	if	 doctor 	 s 	 	did	n't	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	now	let	's	 app 	 ly 	 	that	to	 system 	 s 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	like	cancer	.
the	problem	is	that	,	in	cancer	,	there	is	n't	 some 	 thing 	 	else	that	's	 in 	 side 	 	of	you	.
it	's	you	;	you	're	broken	.
that	conversation	 in 	 side 	 	of	you	got	 mix 	 ed 	 	up	in	some	way	.
so	how	do	we	 diagnos 	 e 	 	that	conversation	?
well	,	right	now	what	we	do	is	we	divide	it	by	part	of	the	body	--	you	know	,	where	did	it	appear	?	--	and	we	put	you	in	different	 categor 	 ies 	 	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	the	part	of	the	body	.
and	then	we	do	a	 clinic 	 al 	 	trial	for	a	drug	for	lung	cancer	and	one	for	 pro 	 state 	 	cancer	and	one	for	breast	cancer	,	and	we	treat	these	 a 	 s 	 	if	they	're	 separat 	 e 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	and	that	 th 	 is 	 	way	of	 divid 	 ing 	 	them	had	 some 	 thing 	 	to	do	with	what	 actual 	 ly 	 	went	wrong	.
and	of	course	,	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	that	much	to	do	with	what	went	wrong
 be 	 cause 	 	cancer	is	a	failure	of	the	system	.
and	in	fact	,	i	think	we	're	even	wrong	when	we	talk	about	cancer	 a 	 s 	 	a	thing	.
i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	big	 mistak 	 e 	 	.
i	think	cancer	should	not	be	a	 no 	 un 	 	.
we	should	talk	about	 cancer 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	we	do	,	not	 some 	 thing 	 	we	have	.
and	so	 t 	 hose 	 	 tumor 	 s 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	are	 symptom 	 s 	 	of	cancer	.
and	so	your	body	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	 cancer 	 ing 	 	all	the	time	,
but	there	are	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 system 	 s 	 	in	your	body	that	keep	it	under	control	.
and	so	to	give	you	an	idea	of	an	 analog 	 y 	 	of	what	i	mean	by	 think 	 ing 	 	of	 cancer 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	verb	,
imagine	we	did	n't	know	 any 	 thing 	 	about	 plumb 	 ing 	 	,	and	the	way	that	we	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	it	,	we	'd	come	home	and	we	'd	find	a	leak	in	our	kitchen	and	we	'd	say	,	``	oh	,	my	house	 ha 	 s 	 	water	.	``
we	might	divide	it	--	the	 plumb 	 er 	 	would	say	,	``	well	,	where	's	the	water	?	``
``	well	,	it	's	in	the	kitchen	.	``	``	oh	,	you	must	have	kitchen	water	.	``
that	's	kind	of	the	level	at	which	it	is	.
``	kitchen	water	,
well	,	first	of	all	,	we	'll	go	in	there	and	we	'll	mop	out	a	lot	of	it	.
and	then	we	know	that	if	we	 sprinkl 	 e 	 	drano	around	the	kitchen	,	that	 help 	 s 	 	.
 where 	 a 	 s 	 	living	room	water	,	it	's	better	to	do	tar	on	the	roof	.	``
and	it	 sound 	 s 	 	 s 	 il 	 ly 	 	,
but	that	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	what	we	do	.
and	i	'm	not	 say 	 ing 	 	you	should	n't	mop	up	your	water	if	you	have	cancer	,
but	i	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	that	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	the	problem	;	that	's	the	symptom	of	the	problem	.
what	we	 re 	 ally 	 	need	to	get	at	is	the	process	that	's	going	on	,	and	that	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	at	the	level	of	the	 proteo 	 nomic 	 	 action 	 s 	 	,	 happen 	 ing 	 	at	the	level	of	why	is	your	body	not	 heal 	 ing 	 	 it 	 self 	 	in	the	way	that	it	 normal 	 ly 	 	 do 	 es 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	 normal 	 ly 	 	,	your	body	is	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	problem	all	the	time	.
so	your	house	is	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	 leak 	 s 	 	all	the	time	,
but	it	's	 fix 	 ing 	 	them	.	it	's	 drain 	 ing 	 	them	out	and	so	on	.
so	what	we	need	is	to	have	a	 caus 	 ative 	 	model	of	what	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	on	,
and	 proteo 	 mic 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 give 	 s 	 	us	the	ability	to	build	a	model	like	that	.
david	got	me	 invit 	 ed 	 	to	give	a	talk	at	national	cancer	institute	and	anna	barker	was	there	.
and	so	i	 g 	 ave 	 	 th 	 is 	 	talk	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	why	do	n't	you	 guy 	 s 	 	do	 th 	 is 	 	?	``
and	anna	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 be 	 cause 	 	 no 	 body 	 	 with 	 in 	 	cancer	would	look	at	it	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
but	what	we	're	going	to	do	,	is	we	're	going	to	create	a	program	for	people	 out 	 side 	 	the	field	of	cancer	to	get	together	with	 doctor 	 s 	 	who	 re 	 ally 	 	know	about	cancer	and	work	out	different	 program 	 s 	 	of	research	.	``
so	david	and	i	 appli 	 ed 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	program	and	 create 	 d 	 	a	 con 	 sort 	 ium 	 	at	usc	where	we	've	got	some	of	the	best	 onco 	 logists 	 	in	the	world	and	some	of	the	best	 biologist 	 s 	 	in	the	world	,	from	cold	spring	harbor	,	stanford	,	austin	--	i	wo	n't	even	go	through	and	name	all	the	 place 	 s 	 	--	to	have	a	research	project	that	will	last	for	five	 year 	 s 	 	where	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	going	to	try	to	build	a	model	of	cancer	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	in	 mic 	 e 	 	first	,
and	we	will	kill	a	lot	of	 mic 	 e 	 	in	the	process	of	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	they	will	die	for	a	good	cause	.
and	we	will	 actual 	 ly 	 	try	to	get	to	the	point	where	we	have	a	 predict 	 ive 	 	model	where	we	can	understand	,	when	cancer	 happen 	 s 	 	,	what	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	there	and	which	 treat 	 ment 	 	will	treat	that	cancer	.
so	let	me	just	end	with	giving	you	a	little	picture	of	what	i	think	cancer	 treat 	 ment 	 	will	be	like	in	the	future	.
so	i	think	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	once	we	have	one	of	these	 model 	 s 	 	for	people	,	which	we	'll	get	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	--	i	mean	,	our	group	wo	n't	get	all	the	way	there	--	but	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	we	'll	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	computer	model	--	sort	of	like	a	global	climate	model	for	weather	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	different	information	about	what	's	the	process	going	on	in	 th 	 is 	 	 proteo 	 mic 	 	conversation	on	 man 	 y 	 	different	 scale 	 s 	 	.
and	so	we	will	 simul 	 ate 	 	in	that	model	for	your	 part 	 icular 	 	cancer	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	 al 	 so 	 	will	be	for	als	,	or	any	kind	of	system	 neuro 	 de 	 generative 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	--	we	will	 simul 	 ate 	 	 specific 	 ally 	 	you	,	not	just	a	generic	person	,	but	what	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	on	 in 	 side 	 	you	.
and	in	that	 simul 	 ation 	 	,	what	we	could	do	is	design	for	you	 specific 	 ally 	 	a	sequence	of	 treat 	 ments 	 	,	and	it	might	be	 ver 	 y 	 	gentle	 treat 	 ments 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	small	 amount 	 s 	 	of	 drug 	 s 	 	.	it	might	be	 thing 	 s 	 	like	,	do	n't	eat	that	day	,	or	give	them	a	little	 chemo 	 therapy 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	a	little	 radi 	 ation 	 	.
of	course	,	we	'll	do	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	and	so	on	.
but	design	a	program	of	 treat 	 ments 	 	 specific 	 ally 	 	for	you	and	help	your	body	guide	back	to	health	--	guide	your	body	back	to	health	.
 be 	 cause 	 	your	body	will	do	most	of	the	work	of	 fix 	 ing 	 	it	if	we	just	sort	of	prop	it	up	in	the	ways	that	are	wrong	.
we	put	it	in	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	 splint 	 s 	 	.
and	so	your	body	 bas 	 ically 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 mechan 	 ism 	 s 	 	for	 fix 	 ing 	 	cancer	,
and	we	just	have	to	prop	 t 	 hose 	 	up	in	the	right	way	and	get	them	to	do	the	job	.
and	so	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	will	be	the	way	that	cancer	will	be	 treat 	 ed 	 	in	the	future	.
it	's	going	to	 requir 	 e 	 	a	lot	of	work	,	a	lot	of	research	.
there	will	be	 man 	 y 	 	 team 	 s 	 	like	our	team	that	work	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	i	think	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	we	will	design	for	 every 	 body 	 	a	custom	 treat 	 ment 	 	for	cancer	.
so	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
