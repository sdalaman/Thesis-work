 th 	 is 	 	session	is	on	natural	 wonder 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 big 	 ger 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	is	on	the	 pur 	 suit 	 	of	happiness	.
i	want	to	try	to	combine	them	all	,	 be 	 cause 	 	to	me	,	 heal 	 ing 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	the	ultimate	natural	wonder	.
your	body	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 remark 	 able 	 	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	begin	 heal 	 ing 	 	 it 	 self 	 	,	and	much	more	 quick 	 ly 	 	than	people	had	once	 real 	 ized 	 	,	if	you	 simpl 	 y 	 	stop	 do 	 ing 	 	what	's	 caus 	 ing 	 	the	problem	.
and	so	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	so	much	of	what	we	do	in	medicine	and	life	in	general	is	focused	on	 mop 	 ping 	 	up	the	floor	 with 	 out 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 turn 	 ing 	 	off	the	faucet	.
i	love	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	work	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 give 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	new	hope	and	new	 choice 	 s 	 	that	they	did	n't	have	before	,	and	it	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	talk	about	 thing 	 s 	 	that	--	not	just	diet	,	but	that	happiness	is	not	--	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	 pur 	 suit 	 	of	happiness	,	but	when	you	 re 	 ally 	 	look	at	all	the	spiritual	 tradition 	 s 	 	,	what	aldous	huxley	 call 	 ed 	 	the	``	 pe 	 rennial 	 	 wis 	 dom 	 	,	``	when	you	get	past	the	named	and	 form 	 s 	 	and	 ritual 	 s 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	divide	people	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	about	--	our	nature	is	to	be	happy	;	our	nature	is	to	be	 peace 	 ful 	 	,	our	nature	is	to	be	 health 	 y 	 	.
and	so	it	's	not	 some 	 thing 	 	--	happiness	is	not	 some 	 thing 	 	you	get	,	health	is	 general 	 ly 	 	not	 some 	 thing 	 	that	you	get	.
but	 ra 	 ther 	 	all	of	these	different	 practice 	 s 	 	--	you	know	,	the	ancient	 swami 	 s 	 	and	 rabbi 	 s 	 	and	 priest 	 s 	 	and	 monk 	 s 	 	and	 n 	 un 	 s 	 	did	n't	develop	these	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	to	just	manage	stress	or	lower	your	blood	pressure	,	 un 	 clog 	 	your	 arteri 	 es 	 	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	it	can	do	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
they	're	 power 	 ful 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	for	 transform 	 ation 	 	,	for	 quiet 	 ing 	 	down	our	mind	and	bodies	to	allow	us	to	experience	what	it	 feel 	 s 	 	like	to	be	happy	,	to	be	 peace 	 ful 	 	,	to	be	 joy 	 ful 	 	and	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	it	's	not	 some 	 thing 	 	that	you	pursue	and	get	,	but	 ra 	 ther 	 	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	you	have	 al 	 ready 	 	 un 	 til 	 	you	disturb	it	.
i	 stud 	 ied 	 	 y 	 oga 	 	for	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	with	a	teacher	named	swami	 satchid 	 ananda 	 	and	people	would	say	,	``	what	are	you	,	a	hindu	?	``	he	'd	say	,	``	no	,	i	'm	an	 un 	 do 	 	.	``
and	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	about	 identify 	 ing 	 	what	's	 caus 	 ing 	 	us	to	disturb	our	innate	health	and	happiness	,	and	then	to	allow	that	natural	 heal 	 ing 	 	to	occur	.
to	me	,	that	's	the	real	natural	wonder	.
so	,	 with 	 in 	 	that	 large 	 r 	 	 con 	 text 	 	,	we	can	talk	about	diet	,	stress	management	--	which	are	 re 	 ally 	 	these	spiritual	 practice 	 s 	 	--	moderate	 exercis 	 e 	 	,	 smok 	 ing 	 	 cess 	 ation 	 	,	support	 group 	 s 	 	and	community	--	which	i	'll	talk	more	about	--	and	some	 vita 	 min 	 s 	 	and	 supplement 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	not	a	diet	.
you	know	,	when	most	people	think	about	the	diet	i	recommend	,	they	think	it	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	strict	diet	.
for	 revers 	 ing 	 	disease	,	that	's	what	it	 take 	 s 	 	,	but	if	you	're	just	 try 	 ing 	 	to	be	 health 	 y 	 	,	you	have	a	spectrum	of	 choice 	 s 	 	.
and	to	the	degree	that	you	can	move	in	a	 health 	 y 	 	direction	,	you	're	going	to	live	 long 	 er 	 	,	you	're	going	to	feel	better	,	you	're	going	to	lose	weight	,	and	so	on	.
and	in	our	 stud 	 ies 	 	,	what	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	do	is	to	use	 ver 	 y 	 	expensive	,	high	-	tech	,	state	-	of	-	the	-	art	 measure 	 s 	 	to	prove	how	 power 	 ful 	 	these	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	and	low	-	tech	and	low	-	cost	--	and	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	,	ancient	--	 intervention 	 s 	 	,	can	be	.
we	first	 beg 	 an 	 	by	looking	at	heart	disease	,	and	when	i	 beg 	 an 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	work	26	or	27	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	it	was	thought	that	once	you	have	heart	disease	it	can	 on 	 ly 	 	get	 wo 	 rse 	 	.
and	what	we	found	was	that	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 get 	 ting 	 	 wo 	 rse 	 	and	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	in	 man 	 y 	 	 case 	 s 	 	it	could	get	better	and	better	,	and	much	more	 quick 	 ly 	 	than	people	had	once	 real 	 ized 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 represent 	 ative 	 	patient	who	at	the	time	was	73	--	 total 	 ly 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	to	have	a	bypass	,	 decide 	 d 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	.	we	used	 quant 	 itative 	 	 arteri 	 ography 	 	,	 show 	 ing 	 	the	 narrow 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	 arteri 	 es 	 	that	feed	the	heart	,	one	of	the	main	 arteri 	 es 	 	,	and	you	can	see	the	 narrow 	 ing 	 	here	.
a	year	 lat 	 er 	 	,	it	's	not	 a 	 s 	 	 clog 	 ged 	 	;	 normal 	 ly 	 	,	it	 go 	 es 	 	the	other	direction	.
these	minor	 change 	 s 	 	in	 block 	 age 	 s 	 	 caus 	 ed 	 	a	300	percent	 improve 	 ment 	 	in	blood	flow	,	and	using	cardiac	 posit 	 ron 	 	 e 	 mission 	 	 tomo 	 graphy 	 	,	or	``	pet	,	``	 s 	 can 	 s 	 	,	blue	and	black	is	no	blood	flow	,	 o 	 range 	 	and	white	is	 maxim 	 al 	 	.
huge	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	can	occur	 with 	 out 	 	 drug 	 s 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	.
 clinic 	 ally 	 	,	he	 liter 	 ally 	 	could	n't	walk	 a 	 cross 	 	the	street	 with 	 out 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	severe	chest	pain	;	 with 	 in 	 	a	month	,	like	most	people	,	was	pain	-	free	,	and	 with 	 in 	 	a	year	,	 climb 	 ing 	 	more	than	100	 floor 	 s 	 	a	day	on	a	stairmaster	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 un 	 usual 	 	,	and	it	's	part	of	what	 en 	 able 	 s 	 	people	to	maintain	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 change 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 make 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	a	big	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	quality	of	life	.
 over 	 all 	 	,	if	you	 look 	 ed 	 	at	all	the	 arteri 	 es 	 	in	all	the	 patient 	 s 	 	,	they	got	 wo 	 rse 	 	and	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	from	one	year	to	five	 year 	 s 	 	,	in	the	 compar 	 ison 	 	group	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	natural	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	heart	disease	,
but	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	not	natural	 be 	 cause 	 	we	found	it	could	get	better	and	better	,	and	much	more	 quick 	 ly 	 	than	people	had	once	thought	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	found	that	the	more	people	change	,	the	better	they	got	.
it	was	n't	a	function	of	how	old	or	how	sick	they	 we 	 re 	 	--	it	was	 main 	 ly 	 	how	much	they	 change 	 d 	 	,	and	the	 old 	 est 	 	 patient 	 s 	 	 improv 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	the	young	 one 	 s 	 	.
i	got	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	christmas	card	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	from	two	of	the	 patient 	 s 	 	in	one	of	our	 program 	 s 	 	.
the	 young 	 er 	 	brother	is	86	,	the	 old 	 er 	 	one	's	95	;	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	show	me	how	much	more	 flex 	 ible 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	.
and	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	year	they	 s 	 ent 	 	me	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	which	i	thought	was	kind	of	funny	.
you	just	never	know	.
and	what	we	found	was	that	99	percent	of	the	 patient 	 s 	 	start	to	reverse	the	 progress 	 ion 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	heart	disease	.
now	i	thought	,	you	know	,	if	we	just	did	good	science	,	that	would	change	medical	practice	.	but	,	that	was	a	little	naive	.
it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	,	but	not	 en 	 ough 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	 doctor 	 s 	 	do	what	we	get	paid	to	do	,	and	we	get	trained	to	do	what	we	get	paid	to	do	,	so	if	we	change	 insur 	 ance 	 	,	then	we	change	medical	practice	and	medical	education	.
 insur 	 ance 	 	will	cover	the	bypass	,	it	'll	cover	the	 angio 	 plast 	 y 	 	;
it	wo	n't	,	 un 	 til 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	cover	diet	and	 life 	 style 	 	.
so	,	we	 beg 	 an 	 	through	our	 non 	 profit 	 	institute	's	training	 hospital 	 s 	 	around	the	country	,	and	we	found	that	most	people	could	avoid	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	,	and	not	 on 	 ly 	 	was	it	 medical 	 ly 	 	effective	,	it	was	 al 	 so 	 	cost	effective	.
and	the	 insur 	 ance 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	found	that	they	 beg 	 an 	 	to	 s 	 ave 	 	 al 	 most 	 	30,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	per	patient	,	and	medicare	is	now	in	the	middle	of	 do 	 ing 	 	a	 demonst 	 ration 	 	project	where	they	're	 pay 	 ing 	 	for	1,800	people	to	go	through	the	program	on	the	 s 	 ites 	 	that	we	train	.
the	 fortune 	 teller 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	give	 smok 	 ers 	 	a	 dis 	 count 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	not	 a 	 s 	 	much	to	tell	.	``	i	like	 th 	 is 	 	slide	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	a	chance	to	talk	about	what	 re 	 ally 	 	 motiv 	 ates 	 	people	to	change	,	and	what	 do 	 es 	 	n't	.
and	what	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	is	fear	of	 dy 	 ing 	 	,	and	that	's	what	's	 normal 	 ly 	 	used	.
 every 	 body 	 	who	 smoke 	 s 	 	 know 	 s 	 	it	's	not	good	for	you	,	and	still	30	percent	of	americans	smoke	--	80	percent	in	some	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	world	.	why	do	people	do	it	?
well	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 help 	 s 	 	them	get	through	the	day	.
and	i	'll	talk	more	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	the	real	 epi 	 demic 	 	is	n't	just	heart	disease	or	 obes 	 ity 	 	or	 smok 	 ing 	 	--	it	's	 lone 	 lines 	 s 	 	and	 depress 	 ion 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	one	woman	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	've	got	20	 friend 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	package	of	 cigar 	 ette 	 s 	 	,	and	they	're	 al 	 ways 	 	there	for	me	and	 no 	 body 	 	else	is	.
you	're	going	to	take	away	my	20	 friend 	 s 	 	?	what	are	you	going	to	give	me	?	``
or	they	eat	when	they	get	 depress 	 ed 	 	,	or	they	use	alcohol	to	numb	the	pain	,	or	they	work	too	hard	,	or	watch	too	much	tv	.
there	are	 lot 	 s 	 	of	ways	we	have	of	 avoid 	 ing 	 	and	 numb 	 ing 	 	and	 bypass 	 ing 	 	pain	,	but	the	point	of	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	to	deal	with	the	cause	of	the	problem	.	and	the	pain	is	not	the	problem	:	it	's	the	symptom	.
and	 tell 	 ing 	 	people	they	're	going	to	die	is	too	 scar 	 y 	 	to	think	about	,	or	,	they	're	going	to	get	emphysema	or	heart	attack	is	too	 scar 	 y 	 	,	and	so	they	do	n't	want	to	think	about	it	,	so	they	do	n't	.
the	most	effective	anti	-	 smok 	 ing 	 	ad	was	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
you	'll	notice	the	 l 	 imp 	 	 cigar 	 ette 	 	 hang 	 ing 	 	out	of	his	mouth	,	and	``	 im 	 pot 	 ence 	 	``	--	the	 head 	 line 	 	is	,	``	 im 	 potent 	 	``	--	it	's	not	emphysema	.
what	was	the	 big 	 gest 	 	selling	drug	of	all	time	when	it	was	 introduc 	 ed 	 	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	?
viagra	,	right	?	why	?	 be 	 cause 	 	a	lot	of	 guy 	 s 	 	need	it	.
it	's	not	like	you	say	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	joe	,	i	'm	 hav 	 ing 	 	 erect 	 ile 	 	 dy 	 s 	 function 	 	,	how	about	you	?	``
and	yet	,	look	at	the	number	of	 prescription 	 s 	 	that	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 old 	 	.
it	's	not	so	much	 psycho 	 logical 	 	,	it	's	vascular	,	and	 nic 	 ot 	 ine 	 	 make 	 s 	 	your	 arteri 	 es 	 	 con 	 strict 	 	.
so	 do 	 es 	 	 coca 	 ine 	 	,	so	 do 	 es 	 	a	high	fat	diet	,	so	 do 	 es 	 	 emotion 	 al 	 	stress	.
so	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 behavior 	 s 	 	that	we	think	of	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	so	sexy	in	our	culture	are	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 one 	 s 	 	that	 leav 	 e 	 	so	 man 	 y 	 	people	 feel 	 ing 	 	 tire 	 d 	 	,	 let 	 ha 	 rgic 	 	,	 depress 	 ed 	 	and	 im 	 potent 	 	,	and	that	's	not	much	 f 	 un 	 	.
but	when	you	change	 t 	 hose 	 	 behavior 	 s 	 	,	your	brain	 get 	 s 	 	more	blood	,	you	think	more	 clear 	 ly 	 	,	you	have	more	energy	,	your	heart	 get 	 s 	 	more	blood	in	ways	i	've	 show 	 n 	 	you	.
your	sexual	function	 improve 	 s 	 	.
and	these	 thing 	 s 	 	occur	 with 	 in 	 	 hour 	 s 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 stud 	 y 	 	:	a	high	fat	meal	,	and	 with 	 in 	 	one	or	two	 hour 	 s 	 	blood	-	flow	is	 measur 	 ably 	 	less	--	and	you	've	all	 experience 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	at	 thank 	 s 	 giving 	 	.
when	you	eat	a	big	fatty	meal	,	how	do	you	feel	?
you	feel	kind	of	 sleep 	 y 	 	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	.
on	a	low	-	fat	meal	,	the	blood	flow	 do 	 es 	 	n't	go	down	--	it	even	 go 	 es 	 	up	.
 man 	 y 	 	of	you	have	 kid 	 s 	 	,	and	you	know	that	's	a	big	change	in	your	 life 	 style 	 	,	and	so	people	are	not	 af 	 raid 	 	to	make	big	 change 	 s 	 	in	 life 	 style 	 	if	they	're	worth	it	.
and	the	paradox	is	that	when	you	make	big	 change 	 s 	 	,	you	get	big	 benefit 	 s 	 	,	and	you	feel	so	much	better	so	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
for	 man 	 y 	 	people	,	 t 	 hose 	 	are	 choice 	 s 	 	worth	making	--	not	to	live	 long 	 er 	 	,	but	to	live	better	.
i	want	to	talk	a	little	bit	about	the	 obes 	 ity 	 	 epi 	 demic 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	a	problem	.
two	-	 third 	 s 	 	of	 adult 	 s 	 	are	 over 	 weight 	 	or	 obes 	 e 	 	,	and	diabetes	in	 kid 	 s 	 	and	30	-	year	-	olds	 ha 	 s 	 	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	70	percent	in	the	last	10	 year 	 s 	 	.	it	's	no	joke	:	it	's	real	.
and	just	to	show	you	 th 	 is 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	from	the	cdc	.	these	are	not	election	 return 	 s 	 	;	these	are	the	 percent 	 age 	 	of	people	who	are	 over 	 weight 	 	.
and	if	you	see	from	'85	to	'86	to	'87	,	'88	,	'89	,	'90	,	'91	--	you	get	a	new	 categor 	 y 	 	,	15	to	20	percent	;	'92	,	'93	,	'94	,	'95	,	'96	,	'97	--	you	get	a	new	 categor 	 y 	 	;	'98	,	'99	,	2000	,	and	2001	.	mississippi	,	more	than	25	percent	of	people	are	 over 	 weight 	 	.
why	is	 th 	 is 	 	?	well	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	way	to	lose	weight	that	 work 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	well	...
but	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	last	,	which	is	the	problem	.
now	,	there	's	no	 myster 	 y 	 	in	how	you	lose	weight	;	you	either	burn	more	 calorie 	 s 	 	by	 exercis 	 e 	 	or	you	eat	 few 	 er 	 	 calorie 	 s 	 	.
now	,	one	way	to	eat	 few 	 er 	 	 calorie 	 s 	 	is	to	eat	less	food	,	which	is	why	you	can	lose	weight	on	any	diet	if	you	eat	less	food	,	or	if	you	restrict	entire	 categor 	 ies 	 	of	 food 	 s 	 	.
but	the	problem	is	,	you	get	 hung 	 ry 	 	,	so	it	's	hard	to	keep	it	off	.
the	other	way	is	to	change	the	type	of	food	.
and	fat	 ha 	 s 	 	nine	 calorie 	 s 	 	per	gram	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	protein	and	 carb 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	have	four	.
so	,	when	you	eat	less	fat	,	you	eat	 few 	 er 	 	 calorie 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	eat	less	food	.
so	you	can	eat	the	same	amount	of	food	,	but	you	'll	be	 get 	 ting 	 	 few 	 er 	 	 calorie 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	food	is	less	dense	in	 calorie 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	the	volume	of	food	that	 affect 	 s 	 	 sati 	 ety 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	the	type	of	food	.
you	know	,	i	do	n't	like	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	atkins	diet	,	but	i	get	 ask 	 ed 	 	about	it	every	day	,	and	so	i	just	thought	i	'd	 s 	 pend 	 	a	few	 minute 	 s 	 	on	that	.
the	myth	that	you	hear	about	is	,	americans	have	 be 	 en 	 	told	to	eat	less	fat	,	the	percent	of	 calorie 	 s 	 	from	fat	is	down	,	americans	are	 fat 	 ter 	 	than	ever	,	 there 	 fore 	 	fat	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	you	fat	.
it	's	a	half	-	truth	.	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	americans	are	eating	more	fat	than	ever	,	and	even	more	 carb 	 s 	 	.	and	so	the	 percent 	 age 	 	is	lower	,	the	actual	amount	is	 high 	 er 	 	,	and	so	the	goal	is	to	 reduc 	 e 	 	both	.
dr.	atkins	and	i	 debate 	 d 	 	each	other	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	before	he	 di 	 ed 	 	,	and	we	 agree 	 d 	 	that	americans	eat	too	 man 	 y 	 	simple	 carb 	 s 	 	,	the	``	bad	 carb 	 s 	 	,	``	and	these	are	 thing 	 s 	 	like	--	--	sugar	,	white	flour	,	white	rice	,	alcohol	.	and	you	get	a	double	 wham 	 my 	 	:	you	get	all	these	 calorie 	 s 	 	that	do	n't	fill	you	up	 be 	 cause 	 	you	've	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	the	fiber	,	and	they	get	 absorb 	 ed 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	so	your	blood	sugar	 zoom 	 s 	 	up	.
your	 pan 	 cre 	 a 	 s 	 	 make 	 s 	 	insulin	to	 br 	 ing 	 	it	back	down	,	which	is	good	.
but	insulin	 accele 	 rates 	 	the	 con 	 version 	 	of	 calorie 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	fat	.
so	,	the	goal	is	not	to	go	to	pork	 rin 	 d 	 s 	 	and	 ba 	 con 	 	and	 sausage 	 s 	 	--	these	are	not	health	 food 	 s 	 	--	but	to	go	from	``	bad	 carb 	 s 	 	``	to	what	are	 call 	 ed 	 	``	good	 carb 	 s 	 	.	``
and	these	are	 thing 	 s 	 	like	whole	 food 	 s 	 	,	or	 un 	 refine 	 d 	 	 carb 	 s 	 	:	 fruit 	 s 	 	,	 veget 	 able 	 s 	 	,	whole	wheat	flour	,	 brow 	 n 	 	rice	,	in	 the 	 ir 	 	natural	 form 	 s 	 	,	are	rich	in	fiber	.
and	the	fiber	 fill 	 s 	 	you	up	before	you	get	too	 man 	 y 	 	 calorie 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 s 	 low 	 s 	 	the	absorption	so	you	do	n't	get	that	rapid	rise	in	blood	sugar	.
so	,	and	you	get	all	the	disease	-	 protect 	 ive 	 	 sub 	 stance 	 s 	 	.
it	's	not	just	what	you	exclude	from	your	diet	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	what	you	include	that	's	 protect 	 ive 	 	.
just	 a 	 s 	 	all	 carb 	 s 	 	are	not	bad	for	you	,	all	 fat 	 s 	 	are	not	bad	for	you	.	there	are	good	 fat 	 s 	 	.
and	these	are	 pre 	 domin 	 ant 	 ly 	 	what	are	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 o 	 mega 	 	-	3	fatty	 acid 	 s 	 	.
you	find	these	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	in	fish	oil	.
and	the	bad	 fat 	 s 	 	are	 thing 	 s 	 	like	trans	-	fatty	 acid 	 s 	 	and	 process 	 ed 	 	food	and	 saturate 	 d 	 	 fat 	 s 	 	,	which	we	find	in	meat	.
if	you	do	n't	remember	 any 	 thing 	 	else	from	 th 	 is 	 	talk	,	three	 gram 	 s 	 	a	day	of	fish	oil	can	 reduc 	 e 	 	your	risk	of	a	heart	attack	and	sudden	death	by	50	to	80	percent	.
three	 gram 	 s 	 	a	day	.	they	come	in	one	-	gram	 cap 	 sule 	 s 	 	;	more	than	that	just	 give 	 s 	 	you	extra	fat	you	do	n't	need	.
it	 al 	 so 	 	 help 	 s 	 	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	risk	of	the	most	common	 cancer 	 s 	 	like	breast	,	 pro 	 state 	 	and	colon	cancer	.
now	,	the	problem	with	the	atkins	diet	,	 every 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	people	who	have	lost	weight	on	it	,	but	you	can	lose	weight	on	 amphet 	 amines 	 	,	you	know	,	and	fen	-	phen	.
i	mean	,	there	are	 lot 	 s 	 	of	ways	of	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	weight	that	are	n't	good	for	you	.
you	want	to	lose	weight	in	a	way	that	 enhance 	 s 	 	your	health	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	the	one	that	 harm 	 s 	 	it	.
and	the	problem	is	that	it	's	based	on	 th 	 is 	 	half	-	truth	,	which	is	that	americans	eat	too	 man 	 y 	 	simple	 carb 	 s 	 	,	so	if	you	eat	 few 	 er 	 	simple	 carb 	 s 	 	you	're	going	to	lose	weight	.
you	'll	lose	even	more	weight	if	you	go	to	whole	 food 	 s 	 	and	less	fat	,	and	you	'll	enhance	your	health	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 harm 	 ing 	 	it	.
he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	've	got	some	good	news	.
while	your	cholesterol	level	 ha 	 s 	 	 remain 	 ed 	 	the	same	,	the	research	 find 	 ing 	 s 	 	have	 change 	 d 	 	.	``
now	,	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	your	heart	when	you	go	on	an	atkins	diet	?
the	red	is	good	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	and	a	year	 lat 	 er 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	from	a	 stud 	 y 	 	 d 	 one 	 	in	a	peer	-	 review 	 ed 	 	journal	 call 	 ed 	 	angiology	--	there	's	more	red	after	a	year	on	a	diet	like	i	would	recommend	,	there	's	less	red	,	less	blood	flow	after	a	year	on	an	atkins	-	type	diet	.
so	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	you	can	lose	weight	,	but	your	heart	is	n't	happy	.
now	,	one	of	the	 stud 	 ies 	 	funded	by	the	atkins	center	found	that	70	percent	of	the	people	 we 	 re 	 	 con 	 s 	 tip 	 ated 	 	,	65	percent	had	bad	breath	,	54	percent	had	 head 	 ache 	 s 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	 health 	 y 	 	way	to	eat	.
and	so	,	you	might	start	to	lose	weight	and	start	to	attract	people	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	you	,	but	when	they	get	too	close	it	's	going	to	be	a	problem	.
and	more	 serious 	 ly 	 	,	there	are	case	 report 	 s 	 	now	of	16	-	year	-	old	 girl 	 s 	 	who	 di 	 ed 	 	after	a	few	 week 	 s 	 	on	the	atkins	diet	--	of	bone	disease	,	 kid 	 ney 	 	disease	,	and	so	on	.
and	that	's	how	your	body	 excrete 	 s 	 	waste	,	is	through	your	breath	,	your	 bowel 	 s 	 	and	your	 perspi 	 ration 	 	.
so	when	you	go	on	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	diet	,	they	begin	to	smell	bad	.
so	,	an	optimal	diet	is	low	in	fat	,	low	in	the	bad	 carb 	 s 	 	,	high	in	the	good	 carb 	 s 	 	and	 en 	 ough 	 	of	the	good	 fat 	 s 	 	.
and	then	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	it	's	a	spectrum	:	when	you	move	in	 th 	 is 	 	direction	,	you	're	going	to	lose	weight	,	you	're	going	to	feel	better	and	you	're	going	to	gain	health	.
now	,	there	are	 eco 	 logical 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	for	eating	lower	on	the	food	chain	too	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	the	 de 	 forest 	 ation 	 	of	the	amazon	,	or	making	more	protein	 avail 	 able 	 	,	to	the	four	billion	people	who	live	on	a	dollar	a	day	--	not	to	 ment 	 ion 	 	 what 	 ever 	 	 ethic 	 al 	 	 concern 	 s 	 	people	have	.
so	,	there	are	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 reason 	 s 	 	for	eating	 th 	 is 	 	way	that	go	beyond	just	your	health	.
now	,	we	're	about	to	publish	the	first	 stud 	 y 	 	looking	at	the	 effect 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	program	on	 pro 	 state 	 	cancer	,	and	,	in	 collabor 	 ation 	 	with	sloane	-	kettering	and	with	ucsf	.	we	took	90	men	who	had	biopsy	-	proven	 pro 	 state 	 	cancer	and	who	had	 elect 	 ed 	 	,	for	 reason 	 s 	 	 un 	 related 	 	to	the	 stud 	 y 	 	,	not	to	have	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	.
we	could	 random 	 ly 	 	divide	them	 in 	 to 	 	two	 group 	 s 	 	,	and	then	we	could	have	one	group	that	is	a	non	-	intervention	control	group	to	 compar 	 e 	 	to	,	which	we	ca	n't	do	with	,	say	,	breast	cancer	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 every 	 one 	 	 get 	 s 	 	 treat 	 ed 	 	.
what	we	found	was	that	,	after	a	year	,	 non 	 e 	 	of	the	 experiment 	 al 	 	group	 patient 	 s 	 	who	made	these	 life 	 style 	 	 change 	 s 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	 treat 	 ment 	 	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	six	of	the	control	-	group	 patient 	 s 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	or	 radi 	 ation 	 	.
when	we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 the 	 ir 	 	psa	 level 	 s 	 	--	which	is	a	marker	for	 pro 	 state 	 	cancer	--	they	got	 wo 	 rse 	 	in	the	control	group	,	but	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	got	better	in	the	 experiment 	 al 	 	group	,	and	these	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 high 	 ly 	 	significant	.
and	then	i	 wonder 	 ed 	 	:	was	there	any	relationship	between	how	much	people	 change 	 d 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	diet	and	 life 	 style 	 	--	 which 	 ever 	 	group	they	 we 	 re 	 	in	--	and	the	 change 	 s 	 	in	psa	?
and	 s 	 ure 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	we	found	a	dose	-	 respons 	 e 	 	relationship	,	just	like	we	found	in	the	 arteri 	 al 	 	 block 	 age 	 s 	 	in	our	cardiac	 stud 	 ies 	 	.
and	in	order	for	the	psa	to	go	down	,	they	had	to	make	 pre 	 tty 	 	big	 change 	 s 	 	.
i	then	 wonder 	 ed 	 	,	well	,	 may 	 be 	 	they	're	just	changing	 the 	 ir 	 	psa	,	but	it	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	 affect 	 ing 	 	the	tumor	growth	.
so	we	took	some	of	 the 	 ir 	 	blood	 s 	 er 	 um 	 	and	 s 	 ent 	 	it	down	to	ucla	;	they	 add 	 ed 	 	it	to	a	standard	line	of	 pro 	 state 	 	tumor	 cell 	 s 	 	growing	in	tissue	culture	,	and	it	 inhibit 	 ed 	 	the	growth	seven	 time 	 s 	 	more	in	the	 experiment 	 al 	 	group	than	in	the	control	group	--	70	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	9	percent	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	i	wonder	if	there	's	any	relationship	between	how	much	people	change	and	how	it	 inhibit 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	tumor	growth	,	 which 	 ever 	 	group	they	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	be	in	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	got	me	 excit 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	,	we	found	the	same	pattern	:	the	more	people	change	,	the	more	it	 affect 	 ed 	 	the	growth	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 tumor 	 s 	 	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	we	did	mri	and	mr	 spect 	 roscopy 	 	 s 	 can 	 s 	 	on	some	of	these	 patient 	 s 	 	,	and	the	tumor	activity	is	 show 	 n 	 	in	red	in	 th 	 is 	 	patient	,	and	you	can	see	 clear 	 ly 	 	it	's	better	a	year	 lat 	 er 	 	,	 a 	 long 	 	with	the	psa	going	down	.
so	,	if	it	's	true	for	 pro 	 state 	 	cancer	,	it	'll	 al 	 most 	 	 certain 	 ly 	 	be	true	for	breast	cancer	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
and	 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	you	have	 convention 	 al 	 	 treat 	 ment 	 	,	in	 add 	 ition 	 	,	if	you	make	these	 change 	 s 	 	,	it	may	help	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	risk	of	 recur 	 rence 	 	.
the	last	thing	i	want	to	talk	about	,	apropos	of	the	issue	of	the	 pur 	 suit 	 	of	happiness	,	is	that	 stud 	 y 	 	after	 stud 	 y 	 	have	 show 	 n 	 	that	people	who	are	 lone 	 ly 	 	and	 depress 	 ed 	 	--	and	 depress 	 ion 	 	is	the	other	real	 epi 	 demic 	 	in	our	culture	--	are	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	get	sick	and	die	 pre 	 mature 	 ly 	 	,	in	part	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	,	they	're	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	smoke	and	 over 	 eat 	 	and	drink	too	much	and	work	too	hard	and	so	on	.
but	 al 	 so 	 	,	through	 mechan 	 ism 	 s 	 	that	we	do	n't	fully	understand	,	people	who	are	 lone 	 ly 	 	and	 depress 	 ed 	 	are	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	--	three	to	five	to	ten	 time 	 s 	 	,	in	some	 stud 	 ies 	 	--	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	get	sick	and	die	 pre 	 mature 	 ly 	 	.
and	 depress 	 ion 	 	is	 treat 	 able 	 	.	we	need	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	that	.
now	,	on	the	other	hand	,	 any 	 thing 	 	that	 promote 	 s 	 	 in 	 timacy 	 	is	 heal 	 ing 	 	.
it	can	be	sexual	 in 	 timacy 	 	--	i	happen	to	think	that	 heal 	 ing 	 	energy	and	 er 	 otic 	 	energy	are	just	different	 form 	 s 	 	of	the	same	thing	.
 friend 	 ship 	 	,	 al 	 truism 	 	,	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	service	--	all	the	 pe 	 rennial 	 	 truth 	 s 	 	that	we	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	that	are	part	of	all	 relig 	 ion 	 	and	all	 culture 	 s 	 	--	once	you	stop	 try 	 ing 	 	to	see	the	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	,	these	are	the	 thing 	 s 	 	in	our	own	self	-	interest	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	free	us	from	our	 suffer 	 ing 	 	and	from	disease	.
and	it	's	in	a	sense	the	most	 self 	 ish 	 	thing	that	we	can	do	.
just	take	a	look	at	one	 stud 	 y 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	was	 d 	 one 	 	by	david	spiegel	at	stanford	.
he	took	women	with	 metasta 	 tic 	 	breast	cancer	,	 random 	 ly 	 	 divid 	 ed 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	two	 group 	 s 	 	.
one	group	of	people	just	met	for	an	hour	-	and	-	a	-	half	once	a	week	in	a	support	group	.
it	was	a	 nurtur 	 ing 	 	,	loving	environment	,	where	they	 we 	 re 	 	 encourag 	 ed 	 	to	let	down	 the 	 ir 	 	 emotion 	 al 	 	 defense 	 s 	 	and	talk	about	how	awful	it	is	to	have	breast	cancer	with	people	who	 under 	 stood 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	going	through	it	too	.
they	just	met	once	a	week	for	a	year	.
five	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	women	lived	twice	 a 	 s 	 	long	,	and	you	can	see	that	the	people	--	and	that	was	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	the	 group 	 s 	 	.
it	was	a	 random 	 ized 	 	control	 stud 	 y 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	in	the	 lance 	 t 	 	.
other	 stud 	 ies 	 	have	 show 	 n 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
so	,	these	simple	 thing 	 s 	 	that	create	 in 	 timacy 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 heal 	 ing 	 	,	and	even	the	word	 heal 	 ing 	 	,	it	 come 	 s 	 	from	the	root	``	to	make	whole	.	``	the	word	 y 	 oga 	 	 come 	 s 	 	from	the	sanskrit	,	meaning	``	 un 	 ion 	 	,	to	 y 	 oke 	 	,	to	 br 	 ing 	 	together	.	``
and	the	last	slide	i	want	to	show	you	is	from	--	i	was	--	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	swami	that	i	 stud 	 ied 	 	with	for	so	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	i	did	a	 combine 	 d 	 	 onco 	 logy 	 	and	 cardio 	 logy 	 	grand	 round 	 s 	 	at	the	university	of	virginia	medical	school	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	at	the	end	of	it	,	 some 	 body 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	swami	,	what	's	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	 well 	 ness 	 	and	 ill 	 ness 	 	?	``
and	so	he	went	up	on	the	board	and	he	wrote	the	word	``	 ill 	 ness 	 	,	``	and	 circle 	 d 	 	the	first	letter	,	and	then	wrote	the	word	``	 well 	 ness 	 	,	``	and	 circle 	 d 	 	the	first	two	 letter 	 s 	 	...	to	me	,	it	's	just	 short 	 hand 	 	for	what	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	:	that	 any 	 thing 	 	that	 create 	 s 	 	a	sense	of	 connect 	 ion 	 	and	community	and	love	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 heal 	 ing 	 	.
and	then	we	can	enjoy	our	 live 	 s 	 	more	fully	 with 	 out 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	sick	in	the	process	.
