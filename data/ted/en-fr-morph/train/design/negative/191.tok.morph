so	,	i	guess	it	is	a	result	of	 global 	 ization 	 	that	you	can	find	coca	-	 col 	 a 	 	 tin 	 s 	 	on	top	of	everest	and	a	buddhist	monk	in	monterey	.
and	so	i	just	came	,	two	 day 	 s 	 	ago	,	from	the	himalayas	to	your	kind	 invit 	 ation 	 	.
so	i	would	like	to	 invit 	 e 	 	you	,	 al 	 so 	 	,	for	a	while	,	to	the	himalayas	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
and	to	show	the	place	where	 medit 	 ators 	 	,	like	me	,	who	 beg 	 an 	 	with	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 mole 	 cular 	 	biologist	in	pasteur	institute	,	and	found	 the 	 ir 	 	way	to	the	 mountain 	 s 	 	.
so	these	are	a	few	 image 	 s 	 	i	was	 luck 	 y 	 	to	take	and	be	there	.
there	's	the	mount	kailash	in	eastern	tibet	--	 wonder 	 ful 	 	setting	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	from	marlboro	country	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	turquoise	lake	.
a	 medit 	 ator 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 hot 	 test 	 	day	of	the	year	 some 	 where 	 	in	eastern	tibet	,	on	august	1	.
and	the	night	before	,	we	 camp 	 ed 	 	,	and	my	tibetan	 friend 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	are	going	to	sleep	 out 	 side 	 	.	``	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	why	?	we	have	 en 	 ough 	 	space	in	the	tent	.	``
they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	but	it	's	 summer 	 time 	 	.	``
so	now	,	we	are	going	to	speak	of	happiness	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	frenchman	,	i	must	say	that	there	are	a	lot	of	french	 intellectual 	 s 	 	that	think	happiness	is	not	at	all	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
i	just	wrote	an	essay	on	happiness	,	and	there	was	a	 contr 	 over 	 s 	 y 	 	.
and	 some 	 one 	 	wrote	an	article	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	do	n't	impose	on	us	the	 dirt 	 y 	 	work	of	happiness	.	``
``	we	do	n't	care	about	 be 	 ing 	 	happy	.	we	need	to	live	with	 pass 	 ion 	 	.
we	like	the	 up 	 s 	 	and	 down 	 s 	 	of	life	.
we	like	our	 suffer 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	so	good	when	it	 cease 	 s 	 	for	a	while	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	see	from	the	 balc 	 ony 	 	of	my	 hermit 	 age 	 	in	the	himalayas	.
it	's	about	two	 meter 	 s 	 	by	three	,	and	you	are	all	welcome	any	time	.
now	,	let	's	come	to	happiness	or	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	.
and	first	of	all	,	you	know	,	 de 	 spite 	 	what	the	french	 intellectual 	 s 	 	say	,	it	 seem 	 s 	 	that	no	one	 wake 	 s 	 	up	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	may	i	suffer	the	whole	day	?	``
which	 mean 	 s 	 	that	 some 	 how 	 	--	 conscious 	 ly 	 	or	not	,	 direct 	 ly 	 	or	 in 	 direct 	 ly 	 	,	in	the	short	or	the	long	term	,	 what 	 ever 	 	we	do	,	 what 	 ever 	 	we	hope	,	 what 	 ever 	 	we	dream	--	 some 	 how 	 	,	is	related	to	a	deep	,	 pro 	 found 	 	 desir 	 e 	 	for	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	or	happiness	.
 a 	 s 	 	pascal	 s 	 aid 	 	,	even	the	one	who	 hang 	 s 	 	 him 	 self 	 	,	 some 	 how 	 	,	is	looking	for	 cess 	 ation 	 	of	 suffer 	 ing 	 	--	he	 find 	 s 	 	no	other	way	.
but	then	,	if	you	look	in	the	 liter 	 ature 	 	,	east	and	west	,	you	can	find	 in 	 credible 	 	 divers 	 ity 	 	of	definition	of	happiness	.
some	people	say	,	i	 on 	 ly 	 	 believ 	 ed 	 	in	 remember 	 ing 	 	the	past	,	 imagin 	 ing 	 	the	future	,	never	the	present	.
some	people	say	happiness	is	right	now	;	it	's	the	quality	of	the	 fresh 	 ness 	 	of	the	present	moment	.
and	that	led	to	henri	bergson	,	the	french	 philosoph 	 er 	 	,	to	say	,	``	all	the	great	 think 	 ers 	 	of	 human 	 ity 	 	have	left	happiness	in	the	vague	so	that	they	could	define	--	each	of	them	could	define	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 term 	 s 	 	.	``
well	,	that	would	be	fine	if	it	was	just	a	 second 	 ary 	 	 pre 	 occupation 	 	in	life	.
but	now	,	if	it	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	going	to	determine	the	quality	of	every	instant	of	our	life	,	then	we	better	know	what	it	is	,	have	some	 clear 	 er 	 	idea	.
and	 prob 	 ably 	 	,	the	fact	that	we	do	n't	know	that	is	why	,	so	often	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	we	seek	happiness	,	it	 seem 	 s 	 	we	turn	our	back	to	it	.
 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	we	want	to	avoid	 suffer 	 ing 	 	,	it	 seem 	 s 	 	we	are	running	 some 	 what 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	it	.
and	that	can	 al 	 so 	 	come	from	some	kind	of	 con 	 fusion 	 s 	 	.
one	of	the	most	common	 one 	 s 	 	is	happiness	and	pleasure	.
but	,	if	you	look	at	the	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	two	,	pleasure	is	 con 	 ting 	 ent 	 	 up 	 on 	 	time	,	 up 	 on 	 	 it 	 s 	 	object	,	 up 	 on 	 	the	place	.
it	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	--	 change 	 s 	 	of	nature	.
 beaut 	 iful 	 	chocolate	cake	:	first	 serv 	 ing 	 	is	 delic 	 ious 	 	,	second	one	not	so	much	,	then	we	feel	disgust	.
that	's	the	nature	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.	we	get	 tire 	 d 	 	.
i	used	to	be	a	fan	of	bach	.	i	used	to	play	it	on	the	guitar	,	you	know	.
i	can	hear	it	two	,	three	,	five	 time 	 s 	 	.
if	i	had	to	hear	it	24	 hour 	 s 	 	,	non	-	stop	,	it	might	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 ti 	 ring 	 	.
if	you	are	 feel 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	cold	,	you	come	near	a	fire	,	it	's	so	 wonder 	 ful 	 	.
then	,	after	some	 moment 	 s 	 	,	you	just	go	a	little	back	,	and	then	it	 start 	 s 	 	 burn 	 ing 	 	.
it	sort	of	uses	 it 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	experience	it	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	it	can	--	 al 	 so 	 	,	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	you	--	it	is	not	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	 radi 	 ating 	 	 out 	 side 	 	.
like	,	you	can	feel	 intens 	 e 	 	pleasure	and	some	 other 	 s 	 	around	you	can	be	 suffer 	 ing 	 	a	lot	.
now	,	what	,	then	,	will	be	happiness	?
and	happiness	,	of	course	,	is	 s 	 uch 	 	a	vague	word	,	so	let	's	say	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	.
and	so	,	i	think	the	best	definition	,	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	the	buddhist	view	,	is	that	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	is	not	just	a	mere	 pleas 	 ur 	 able 	 	 sens 	 ation 	 	.
it	is	a	deep	sense	of	 s 	 er 	 en 	 ity 	 	and	 fulfill 	 ment 	 	,	a	state	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 pervad 	 es 	 	and	 under 	 lies 	 	all	 emotion 	 al 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	and	all	the	 joy 	 s 	 	and	 sorrow 	 s 	 	that	can	come	one	's	way	.
for	you	,	that	might	be	surprising	.
can	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	while	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 ad 	 	?	in	a	way	,	why	not	?
 be 	 cause 	 	we	are	 s 	 peaking 	 	of	a	different	level	.
look	at	the	 wave 	 s 	 	coming	here	to	shore	.
when	you	are	at	the	bottom	of	the	wave	,	you	hit	the	bottom	.
you	hit	the	solid	rock	.
when	you	are	surfing	on	the	top	,	you	are	all	 el 	 ated 	 	.
so	you	go	from	 el 	 ation 	 	to	 depress 	 ion 	 	--	there	's	no	depth	.
now	,	if	you	look	at	the	high	sea	,	there	might	be	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	calm	ocean	,	like	a	mirror	.
there	might	be	 storm 	 s 	 	,	but	the	depth	of	the	ocean	is	still	there	,	 un 	 change 	 d 	 	.
so	now	,	how	is	that	?
it	can	 on 	 ly 	 	be	a	state	of	 be 	 ing 	 	,	not	just	a	 fleet 	 ing 	 	emotion	,	 sens 	 ation 	 	.
even	joy	--	that	can	be	the	spring	of	happiness	.
but	there	's	 al 	 so 	 	 wick 	 ed 	 	joy	,	you	can	 re 	 jo 	 ice 	 	in	 some 	 one 	 	's	 suffer 	 ing 	 	.
so	how	do	we	proceed	in	our	quest	for	happiness	?	 ver 	 y 	 	often	,	we	look	 out 	 side 	 	.
we	think	that	if	we	could	gather	 th 	 is 	 	and	that	,	all	the	 condition 	 s 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	say	,	``	 every 	 thing 	 	to	be	happy	--
to	have	 every 	 thing 	 	to	be	happy	.	``
that	 ver 	 y 	 	sentence	 al 	 ready 	 	 reveal 	 s 	 	the	doom	of	 destruct 	 ion 	 	of	happiness	.
to	have	 every 	 thing 	 	.	if	we	 mis 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	,	it	 collapse 	 s 	 	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	,	when	 thing 	 s 	 	go	wrong	,	we	try	to	fix	the	 out 	 side 	 	so	much	,	but	our	control	of	the	 out 	 er 	 	world	is	 limit 	 ed 	 	,	 tempor 	 ary 	 	,	and	often	,	 ill 	 us 	 ory 	 	.
so	now	,	look	at	inner	 condition 	 s 	 	.	are	n't	they	 strong 	 er 	 	?
is	n't	it	the	mind	that	 transl 	 ates 	 	the	 out 	 er 	 	condition	 in 	 to 	 	happiness	and	 suffer 	 ing 	 	?
and	is	n't	that	 strong 	 er 	 	?
we	know	,	by	experience	,	that	we	can	be	what	we	call	``	a	little	 para 	 dis 	 e 	 	,	``	and	yet	,	be	 complete 	 ly 	 	 un 	 happy 	 	 with 	 in 	 	.
the	dalai	lama	was	once	in	portugal	,	and	there	was	a	lot	of	construction	going	on	 every 	 where 	 	.
so	one	 even 	 ing 	 	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	look	,	you	are	 do 	 ing 	 	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	but	is	n't	it	nice	,	 al 	 so 	 	,	to	build	 some 	 thing 	 	 with 	 in 	 	?	``	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 un 	 less 	 	that	--	even	you	get	high	-	tech	flat	on	the	100th	floor	of	a	super	-	modern	and	 comfort 	 able 	 	building	,	if	you	are	 deep 	 ly 	 	 un 	 happy 	 	 with 	 in 	 	,	all	you	are	going	to	look	for	is	a	window	from	which	to	jump	.	``
so	now	,	at	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	,	we	know	a	lot	of	people	who	,	in	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	,	manage	to	keep	 s 	 er 	 en 	 ity 	 	,	inner	strength	,	inner	 free 	 dom 	 	,	confidence	.
so	now	,	if	the	inner	 condition 	 s 	 	are	 strong 	 er 	 	--	of	course	,	the	 out 	 er 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	do	influence	,	and	it	's	 wonder 	 ful 	 	to	live	 long 	 er 	 	,	 health 	 ier 	 	,	to	have	access	to	information	,	education	,	to	be	able	to	travel	,	to	have	 free 	 dom 	 	.	it	's	 high 	 ly 	 	 desir 	 able 	 	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 en 	 ough 	 	.	 t 	 hose 	 	are	just	 auxili 	 ary 	 	,	help	 condition 	 s 	 	.
the	experience	that	 transl 	 ates 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	is	 with 	 in 	 	the	mind	.
so	then	,	when	we	ask	 one 	 self 	 	how	to	nurture	the	condition	for	happiness	,	the	inner	 condition 	 s 	 	,	and	which	are	 t 	 hose 	 	which	will	 under 	 mine 	 	happiness	.
so	then	,	 th 	 is 	 	just	 need 	 s 	 	to	have	some	experience	.
we	have	to	know	from	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	there	are	certain	 state 	 s 	 	of	mind	that	are	 con 	 duc 	 ive 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	 flourish 	 ing 	 	,	to	 th 	 is 	 	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	,	what	the	greeks	 call 	 ed 	 	eudaimonia	,	 flourish 	 ing 	 	.
there	are	some	which	are	 advers 	 e 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	.
and	so	,	if	we	look	from	our	own	experience	,	anger	,	hatred	,	 jealous 	 y 	 	,	 arrog 	 ance 	 	,	 obsess 	 ive 	 	 desir 	 e 	 	,	strong	 grasp 	 ing 	 	,	they	do	n't	 leav 	 e 	 	us	in	 s 	 uch 	 	a	good	state	after	we	have	 experience 	 d 	 	it	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	,	they	are	 detri 	 mental 	 	to	 other 	 s 	 	'	happiness	.
so	we	may	consider	that	the	more	 t 	 hose 	 	are	 invad 	 ing 	 	our	mind	,	and	,	like	a	chain	 re 	 action 	 	,	the	more	we	feel	 mis 	 er 	 able 	 	,	we	feel	 tor 	 ment 	 ed 	 	.
at	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	,	 every 	 one 	 	 know 	 s 	 	deep	 with 	 in 	 	that	an	act	of	 self 	 less 	 	 gene 	 ros 	 ity 	 	,	if	from	the	distance	,	 with 	 out 	 	 any 	 one 	 	 know 	 ing 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	about	it	,	we	could	 s 	 ave 	 	a	child	's	life	,	make	 some 	 one 	 	happy	.
we	do	n't	need	the	 re 	 cognition 	 	.	we	do	n't	need	any	 grat 	 itude 	 	.
just	the	mere	fact	of	 do 	 ing 	 	that	 fill 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	a	sense	of	 ad 	 equ 	 ation 	 	with	our	deep	nature	.
and	we	would	like	to	be	like	that	all	the	time	.
so	is	that	possible	,	to	change	our	way	of	 be 	 ing 	 	,	to	transform	one	's	mind	?
are	n't	 t 	 hose 	 	negative	 emotion 	 s 	 	,	or	 destruct 	 ive 	 	 emotion 	 s 	 	,	inherent	to	the	nature	of	mind	?
is	change	possible	in	our	 emotion 	 s 	 	,	in	our	 trait 	 s 	 	,	in	our	 mood 	 s 	 	?
for	that	we	have	to	ask	,	what	is	nature	of	mind	?
and	if	we	look	from	the	 ex 	 peri 	 ential 	 	point	of	view	,	there	is	a	 prim 	 ary 	 	quality	of	 conscious 	 ness 	 	that	's	just	the	mere	fact	to	be	cognitive	,	to	be	aware	.
 conscious 	 ness 	 	is	like	a	mirror	that	 allow 	 s 	 	all	 image 	 s 	 	to	rise	on	it	.
you	can	have	 ug 	 ly 	 	 face 	 s 	 	,	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 face 	 s 	 	in	the	mirror	.
the	mirror	 allow 	 s 	 	that	,	but	the	mirror	is	not	 tain 	 ted 	 	,	is	not	 modifi 	 ed 	 	,	is	not	 alter 	 ed 	 	by	 t 	 hose 	 	 image 	 s 	 	.
 like 	 wise 	 	,	 be 	 hind 	 	every	single	thought	there	is	the	bare	 conscious 	 ness 	 	,	 pur 	 e 	 	 aware 	 ness 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	nature	.	it	can	not	be	 tain 	 ted 	 	 intrinsic 	 ally 	 	with	hatred	or	 jealous 	 y 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	,	then	,	if	it	was	 al 	 ways 	 	there	--	like	a	dye	that	would	permeate	the	whole	cloth	--	then	it	would	be	found	all	the	time	,	 some 	 where 	 	.
we	know	we	're	not	 al 	 ways 	 	 ang 	 ry 	 	,	 al 	 ways 	 	jealous	,	 al 	 ways 	 	 gen 	 er 	 ous 	 	.
so	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	fabric	of	 conscious 	 ness 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	 pur 	 e 	 	cognitive	quality	that	 different 	 iate 	 s 	 	it	from	a	stone	,	there	is	a	 possibil 	 ity 	 	for	change	 be 	 cause 	 	all	 emotion 	 s 	 	are	 fleet 	 ing 	 	.
that	is	the	ground	for	mind	training	.
mind	training	is	based	on	the	idea	that	two	 oppos 	 ite 	 	mental	 factor 	 s 	 	can	not	happen	at	the	same	time	.
you	could	go	from	love	to	hate	.
but	you	can	not	,	at	the	same	time	,	 to 	 ward 	 	the	same	object	,	the	same	person	,	want	to	harm	and	want	to	do	good	.
you	can	not	,	in	the	same	 gest 	 ure 	 	,	shake	hand	and	give	a	blow	.
so	,	there	are	natural	 antidote 	 s 	 	to	 emotion 	 s 	 	that	are	 destruct 	 ive 	 	to	our	inner	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	.
so	that	's	the	way	to	proceed	.	 re 	 jo 	 ic 	 ing 	 	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	 jealous 	 y 	 	.
a	kind	of	sense	of	inner	 free 	 dom 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ite 	 	to	 intens 	 e 	 	 grasp 	 ing 	 	and	obsession	.
 benevol 	 ence 	 	,	loving	 kind 	 ness 	 	against	hatred	.
but	,	of	course	,	each	emotion	then	would	need	a	 part 	 icular 	 	antidote	.
 an 	 other 	 	way	is	to	try	to	find	a	general	antidote	to	all	 emotion 	 s 	 	,	and	that	's	by	looking	at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	nature	.
 usual 	 ly 	 	,	when	we	feel	 annoy 	 ed 	 	,	hatred	or	 up 	 set 	 	with	 some 	 one 	 	,	or	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	 some 	 thing 	 	,	the	mind	 go 	 es 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	to	that	object	.
each	time	it	 go 	 es 	 	to	the	object	,	it	 reinforce 	 s 	 	that	obsession	or	that	 annoy 	 ance 	 	.
so	then	,	it	's	a	self	-	 perpetu 	 ating 	 	process	.
so	what	we	need	to	look	now	is	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	looking	 out 	 ward 	 	,	we	look	 in 	 ward 	 	.
look	at	anger	 it 	 self 	 	.	it	 look 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 menac 	 ing 	 	,	like	a	 bill 	 ow 	 ing 	 	monsoon	cloud	or	 thunder 	 storm 	 	.
but	we	think	we	could	 s 	 it 	 	on	the	cloud	--	but	if	you	go	there	,	it	's	just	 mis 	 t 	 	.
 like 	 wise 	 	,	if	you	look	at	the	thought	of	anger	,	it	will	vanish	like	frost	under	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	 s 	 un 	 	.
if	you	do	 th 	 is 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	 prop 	 en 	 s 	 ity 	 	,	the	 tend 	 encies 	 	for	anger	to	arise	 aga 	 in 	 	will	be	less	and	less	each	time	you	 dis 	 solve 	 	it	.
and	,	at	the	end	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	it	may	rise	,	it	will	just	cross	the	mind	,	like	a	bird	 cross 	 ing 	 	the	sky	 with 	 out 	 	 leav 	 ing 	 	any	track	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	principal	of	mind	training	.
now	,	it	 take 	 s 	 	time	 be 	 cause 	 	we	--	it	took	time	for	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 fault 	 s 	 	in	our	mind	,	the	 tend 	 encies 	 	,	to	build	up	,	so	it	will	take	time	to	 un 	 fold 	 	them	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
but	that	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	to	go	.
mind	 transform 	 ation 	 	--	that	is	the	 ver 	 y 	 	meaning	of	 medit 	 ation 	 	.
it	 mean 	 s 	 	 familiar 	 ization 	 	with	a	new	way	of	 be 	 ing 	 	,	new	way	of	 per 	 ceiv 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	which	is	more	in	 ad 	 equ 	 ation 	 	with	 re 	 ality 	 	,	with	 inter 	 depend 	 ence 	 	,	with	the	stream	and	 continu 	 ous 	 	 transform 	 ation 	 	,	which	our	 be 	 ing 	 	and	our	 conscious 	 ness 	 	is	.
so	,	the	 inter 	 face 	 	with	cognitive	science	,
since	we	need	to	come	to	that	,	and	it	was	,	i	suppose	,	the	subject	of	--	we	have	to	deal	in	 s 	 uch 	 	a	short	time
with	brain	 plastic 	 ity 	 	.	the	brain	was	thought	to	be	more	or	less	 fix 	 ed 	 	.
all	the	 nomi 	 nal 	 	 connect 	 ions 	 	,	in	 number 	 s 	 	and	 quant 	 ities 	 	,	 we 	 re 	 	thought	--	 un 	 til 	 	the	last	20	 year 	 s 	 	--	thought	to	be	more	or	less	 fix 	 ed 	 	when	we	 reach 	 ed 	 	adult	age	.
now	,	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	found	that	it	can	change	a	lot	.
a	 viol 	 in 	 ist 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	heard	,	who	 ha 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	10,000	 hour 	 s 	 	of	 viol 	 in 	 	practice	,	some	area	that	 control 	 s 	 	the	 move 	 ments 	 	of	 finger 	 s 	 	in	the	brain	change	a	lot	,	increasing	 reinforce 	 ment 	 	of	the	 syn 	 apt 	 ic 	 	 connect 	 ions 	 	.
so	can	we	do	that	with	human	 qual 	 ities 	 	?
with	loving	 kind 	 ness 	 	,	with	patience	,	with	 open 	 ness 	 	?
so	that	's	what	 t 	 hose 	 	great	 medit 	 ators 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	.
some	of	them	who	came	to	the	 lab 	 s 	 	,	like	in	madison	,	wisconsin	,	or	in	berkeley	,	did	20	to	40,000	 hour 	 s 	 	of	 medit 	 ation 	 	.
they	do	,	like	,	three	 year 	 s 	 	'	 re 	 treat 	 	,	where	they	do	meditate	12	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	.
and	then	,	the	rest	of	 the 	 ir 	 	life	,	they	will	do	that	three	or	four	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	.
they	are	real	olympic	 champion 	 s 	 	of	mind	training	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	place	where	the	 medit 	 ators 	 	--	you	can	see	it	's	kind	of	inspiring	.
now	,	here	with	256	 electro 	 de 	 s 	 	.
so	what	did	they	find	?	of	course	,	same	thing	.
the	scientific	 em 	 bar 	 go 	 	--	if	ever	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	to	 submit 	 ted 	 	to	``	nature	,	``	 hope 	 fully 	 	,	it	will	be	 accept 	 ed 	 	.
it	 deal 	 s 	 	with	the	state	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	 un 	 condition 	 al 	 	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
we	 ask 	 ed 	 	 medit 	 ators 	 	,	who	have	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	that	for	 year 	 s 	 	and	 year 	 s 	 	and	 year 	 s 	 	,	to	put	 the 	 ir 	 	mind	in	a	state	where	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	but	loving	 kind 	 ness 	 	,	total	 avail 	 ability 	 	to	 senti 	 ent 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	.
of	course	,	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	training	,	we	do	that	with	 object 	 s 	 	.
we	think	of	people	 suffer 	 ing 	 	,	we	think	of	people	we	love	,	but	at	some	point	,	it	can	be	a	state	which	is	all	 pervad 	 ing 	 	.
here	is	the	 pre 	 liminary 	 	result	,	which	i	can	show	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 al 	 ready 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 show 	 n 	 	.
the	bell	 curv 	 e 	 	 show 	 s 	 	150	 control 	 s 	 	,	and	what	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	at	is	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	the	right	and	the	left	frontal	lobe	.
in	 ver 	 y 	 	short	,	people	who	have	more	activity	in	the	right	side	of	the	 pre 	 frontal 	 	cortex	are	more	 depress 	 ed 	 	,	 withdraw 	 n 	 	.	they	do	n't	 de 	 scribe 	 	a	lot	of	positive	affect	.
it	's	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	on	the	left	side	:	more	 tend 	 ency 	 	to	 al 	 truism 	 	,	to	happiness	,	to	express	,	and	curiosity	and	so	forth	.
so	there	's	a	 bas 	 ic 	 	line	for	people	.	and	 al 	 so 	 	,	it	can	be	 change 	 d 	 	.
if	you	see	a	 com 	 ic 	 	movie	,	you	go	off	to	the	left	side	.
if	you	are	happy	about	 some 	 thing 	 	,	you	'll	go	more	to	the	left	side	.
if	you	have	a	bout	of	 depress 	 ion 	 	,	you	'll	go	to	the	right	side	.
here	,	the	-0.5	is	the	full	standard	 dev 	 iation 	 	of	a	 medit 	 ator 	 	who	 meditate 	 d 	 	on	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	 total 	 ly 	 	out	of	the	bell	 curv 	 e 	 	.
so	,	i	've	no	time	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	all	the	different	scientific	 result 	 s 	 	.
 hope 	 fully 	 	,	they	will	come	.
but	they	found	that	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	after	three	and	a	half	 hour 	 s 	 	in	an	fmri	,	it	's	like	coming	out	of	a	space	ship	.
 al 	 so 	 	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 show 	 n 	 	in	other	 lab 	 s 	 	--	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	paul	ekman	's	 lab 	 s 	 	in	berkeley	--	that	some	 medit 	 ators 	 	are	able	,	 al 	 so 	 	,	to	control	 the 	 ir 	 	 emotion 	 al 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	more	than	it	could	be	thought	.
like	the	 start 	 le 	 	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
if	you	 s 	 it 	 	a	guy	on	a	chair	with	all	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	apparatus	 measur 	 ing 	 	your	physiology	,	and	there	's	kind	of	a	bomb	that	 go 	 es 	 	off	,	it	's	so	 instinct 	 ive 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	that	,	in	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	they	never	saw	 any 	 one 	 	who	will	not	jump	.
some	 medit 	 ators 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	stop	it	,	but	 simpl 	 y 	 	by	 be 	 ing 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	open	,	 think 	 ing 	 	that	that	bang	is	just	going	to	be	just	a	small	event	like	a	 shoot 	 ing 	 	star	,	they	are	able	not	to	move	at	all	.
so	the	whole	point	of	that	is	not	,	sort	of	,	to	make	,	like	,	a	circus	thing	of	 show 	 ing 	 	 exception 	 al 	 	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	who	can	jump	,	or	 what 	 ever 	 	.
it	's	more	to	say	that	mind	training	 matter 	 s 	 	.	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	just	a	 luxur 	 y 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	 supplement 	 ary 	 	 vita 	 min 	 	for	the	soul	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	going	to	determine	the	quality	of	every	instant	of	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
we	are	ready	to	 s 	 pend 	 	15	 year 	 s 	 	 achiev 	 ing 	 	education	.
we	love	to	do	 jog 	 ging 	 	,	 fit 	 ness 	 	.
we	do	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	to	remain	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
yet	,	we	 s 	 pend 	 	 surprising 	 ly 	 	little	time	taking	care	of	what	 matter 	 s 	 	most	--	the	way	our	mind	 function 	 s 	 	--
which	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	is	the	ultimate	thing	that	 determine 	 s 	 	the	quality	of	our	experience	.
now	,	our	 compass 	 ion 	 	is	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	put	in	action	.
that	's	what	we	try	to	do	in	different	 place 	 s 	 	.
just	 th 	 is 	 	one	 ex 	 ample 	 	is	worth	a	lot	of	work	.
 th 	 is 	 	 lad 	 y 	 	with	bone	tb	,	left	 al 	 one 	 	in	a	tent	,	is	going	to	die	with	her	 on 	 ly 	 	daughter	.
one	year	 lat 	 er 	 	,	how	she	is	.
different	 school 	 s 	 	and	 clinic 	 s 	 	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	in	tibet	.
and	just	,	i	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 look 	 s 	 	that	 tell 	 s 	 	more	about	happiness	than	i	could	ever	say	.
and	 jump 	 ing 	 	 monk 	 s 	 	of	tibet	.

thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
