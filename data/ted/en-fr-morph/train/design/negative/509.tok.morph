bacteria	are	the	 old 	 est 	 	living	 organism 	 s 	 	on	the	earth	.
they	've	 be 	 en 	 	here	for	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	what	they	are	are	single	-	celled	 micro 	 scopic 	 	 organism 	 s 	 	.
so	they	are	one	cell	and	they	have	 th 	 is 	 	special	 proper 	 ty 	 	that	they	 on 	 ly 	 	have	one	piece	of	dna	.
they	have	 ver 	 y 	 	few	 gene 	 s 	 	,	and	genetic	information	to	encode	all	of	the	 trait 	 s 	 	that	they	carry	out	.
and	the	way	bacteria	make	a	living	is	that	they	 consum 	 e 	 	 nutrient 	 s 	 	from	the	environment	,	they	grow	to	twice	 the 	 ir 	 	 s 	 ize 	 	,	they	cut	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	down	in	the	middle	,	and	one	cell	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	two	,	and	so	on	and	so	on	.
they	just	grow	and	divide	,	and	grow	and	divide	--	so	a	kind	of	 bor 	 ing 	 	life	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	that	what	i	would	 argu 	 e 	 	is	that	you	have	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 interact 	 ion 	 	with	these	 critter 	 s 	 	.
i	know	you	 guy 	 s 	 	think	of	 your 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 human 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	sort	of	how	i	think	of	you	.
 th 	 is 	 	man	is	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	represent	a	generic	human	 be 	 ing 	 	,
and	all	of	the	 circle 	 s 	 	in	that	man	are	all	of	the	 cell 	 s 	 	that	make	up	your	body	.
there	is	about	a	trillion	human	 cell 	 s 	 	that	make	each	one	of	us	who	we	are	and	able	to	do	all	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	do	,	but	you	have	10	trillion	bacterial	 cell 	 s 	 	in	you	or	on	you	at	any	moment	in	your	life	.
so	,	10	 time 	 s 	 	more	bacterial	 cell 	 s 	 
than	human	 cell 	 s 	 	on	a	human	 be 	 ing 	 	.
and	of	course	it	's	the	dna	that	 count 	 s 	 	,	so	here	's	all	the	a	,	t	,	gs	and	cs	that	make	up	your	genetic	code	,	and	give	you	all	your	 charm 	 ing 	 	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	.
you	have	about	30,000	 gene 	 s 	 	.
well	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	you	have	100	 time 	 s 	 	more	bacterial	 gene 	 s 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	a	role	in	you	or	on	you	all	of	your	life	.
at	the	best	,	you	're	10	percent	human	,	but	more	 like 	 ly 	 	about	one	percent	human	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	which	of	these	 metric 	 s 	 	you	like	.
i	know	you	think	of	 your 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	but	i	think	of	you	 a 	 s 	 	90	or	99	percent	bacterial	.
these	bacteria	are	not	 pass 	 ive 	 	 rider 	 s 	 	,	these	are	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	they	keep	us	 al 	 ive 	 	.
they	cover	us	in	an	 in 	 visible 	 	body	 arm 	 or 	 	that	 keep 	 s 	 	 environment 	 al 	 	 insult 	 s 	 	out	so	that	we	stay	 health 	 y 	 	.
they	digest	our	food	,	they	make	our	 vita 	 min 	 s 	 	,	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	 educ 	 ate 	 	your	 immun 	 e 	 	system	to	keep	bad	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	out	.
so	they	do	all	these	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	help	us	and	are	vital	for	 keep 	 ing 	 	us	 al 	 ive 	 	,	and	they	never	get	any	press	for	that	.
but	they	get	a	lot	of	press	 be 	 cause 	 	they	do	a	lot	of	 terr 	 ible 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
so	,	there	's	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	bacteria	on	the	earth	that	have	no	business	 be 	 ing 	 	in	you	or	on	you	at	any	time	,	and	if	they	are	,	they	make	you	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	sick	.
and	so	,	the	question	for	my	lab	is	 whet 	 her 	 	you	want	to	think	about	all	the	good	 thing 	 s 	 	that	bacteria	do	,	or	all	the	bad	 thing 	 s 	 	that	bacteria	do	.
the	question	we	had	is	how	could	they	do	 any 	 thing 	 	at	all	?
i	mean	they	're	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	small	,	you	have	to	have	a	 micro 	 scope 	 	to	see	one	.
they	live	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	 bor 	 ing 	 	life	where	they	grow	and	divide	,	and	they	've	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 consider 	 ed 	 	to	be	these	 a 	 social 	 	 reclus 	 ive 	 	 organism 	 s 	 	.
and	so	it	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	us	that	they	are	just	too	small	to	have	an	impact	on	the	environment	if	they	 simpl 	 y 	 	act	 a 	 s 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	.
and	so	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	think	if	there	could	n't	be	a	different	way	that	bacteria	live	.
the	clue	to	 th 	 is 	 	came	from	 an 	 other 	 	marine	 bacter 	 ium 	 	,	and	it	's	a	 bacter 	 ium 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	vibrio	 fisc 	 heri 	 	.
what	you	're	looking	at	on	 th 	 is 	 	slide	is	just	a	person	from	my	lab	 hold 	 ing 	 	a	flask	of	a	liquid	culture	of	a	 bacter 	 ium 	 	,	a	 harm 	 less 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 bacter 	 ium 	 	that	 come 	 s 	 	from	the	ocean	,	named	vibrio	 fisc 	 heri 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 bacter 	 ium 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	the	special	 proper 	 ty 	 	that	it	 make 	 s 	 	light	,	so	it	 make 	 s 	 	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nce 	 	,	like	 fire 	 flies 	 	make	light	.
we	're	not	 do 	 ing 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	to	the	 cell 	 s 	 	here	.
we	just	took	the	picture	by	 turn 	 ing 	 	the	 light 	 s 	 	off	in	the	room	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	see	.
what	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	us	was	not	that	the	bacteria	made	light	,	but	when	the	bacteria	made	light	.
what	we	 notice 	 d 	 	is	when	the	bacteria	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 one 	 	,	so	when	they	 we 	 re 	 	in	 di 	 lute 	 	 s 	 us 	 pension 	 	,	they	made	no	light	.
but	when	they	grew	to	a	certain	cell	number	all	the	bacteria	 turn 	 ed 	 	on	light	 simultaneous 	 ly 	 	.
the	question	that	we	had	is	how	can	bacteria	,	these	primitive	 organism 	 s 	 	,	tell	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	from	 time 	 s 	 	when	they	're	 al 	 one 	 	,	and	 time 	 s 	 	when	they	're	in	a	community	,	and	then	all	do	 some 	 thing 	 	together	.
what	we	've	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	is	that	the	way	that	they	do	that	is	that	they	talk	to	each	other	,	and	they	talk	with	a	chemical	language	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	now	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	my	bacterial	cell	.
when	it	's	 al 	 one 	 	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	any	light	.
but	what	it	 do 	 es 	 	do	is	to	make	and	 secret 	 e 	 	small	 molecule 	 s 	 	that	you	can	think	of	like	 hormone 	 s 	 	,	and	these	are	the	red	 triangle 	 s 	 	,	and	when	the	bacteria	is	 al 	 one 	 	the	 molecule 	 s 	 	just	float	away	and	so	no	light	.
but	when	the	bacteria	grow	and	double	and	they	're	all	 particip 	 ating 	 	in	making	these	 molecule 	 s 	 	,	the	molecule	--	the	 extra 	 cellular 	 	amount	of	that	molecule	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	in	proportion	to	cell	number	.
and	when	the	molecule	 hit 	 s 	 	a	certain	amount	that	 tell 	 s 	 	the	bacteria	how	 man 	 y 	 	 neighbor 	 s 	 	there	are	,	they	 recogn 	 ize 	 	that	molecule	and	all	of	the	bacteria	turn	on	light	in	 synchron 	 y 	 	.
that	's	how	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nce 	 	 work 	 s 	 	--	they	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	with	these	chemical	 word 	 s 	 	.
the	reason	that	vibrio	 fisc 	 heri 	 	is	 do 	 ing 	 	that	 come 	 s 	 	from	the	biology	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	 an 	 other 	 	plug	for	the	 animal 	 s 	 	in	the	ocean	,	vibrio	 fisc 	 heri 	 	 live 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 quid 	 	.
what	you	are	looking	at	is	the	hawaiian	bobtail	 s 	 quid 	 	,	and	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	on	 it 	 s 	 	back	,	and	what	i	hope	you	can	see	are	these	two	 glow 	 ing 	 	 lobe 	 s 	 	and	these	house	the	vibrio	 fisc 	 heri 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	,	they	live	in	there	,	at	high	cell	number	that	molecule	is	there	,	and	they	're	making	light	.
the	reason	the	 s 	 quid 	 	is	 will 	 ing 	 	to	put	up	with	these	shenanigans	is	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 want 	 s 	 	that	light	.
the	way	that	 th 	 is 	 	 sym 	 bio 	 sis 	 	 work 	 s 	 	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	little	 s 	 quid 	 	 live 	 s 	 	just	off	the	coast	of	hawaii	,	just	in	sort	of	 sh 	 allow 	 	knee	-	deep	water	.
the	 s 	 quid 	 	is	nocturnal	,	so	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	day	it	 bur 	 ies 	 	 it 	 self 	 	in	the	sand	and	 sleep 	 s 	 	,	but	then	at	night	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	come	out	to	hunt	.
on	bright	 night 	 s 	 	when	there	is	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 star 	 light 	 	or	 moon 	 light 	 	that	light	can	penetrate	the	depth	of	the	water	the	 s 	 quid 	 	 live 	 s 	 	in	,	since	it	's	just	in	 t 	 hose 	 	couple	feet	of	water	.
what	the	 s 	 quid 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	is	a	 shut 	 ter 	 	that	can	open	and	close	over	 th 	 is 	 	 special 	 ized 	 	light	organ	housing	the	bacteria	.
then	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 detect 	 ors 	 	on	 it 	 s 	 	back	so	it	can	sense	how	much	 star 	 light 	 	or	 moon 	 light 	 	is	hitting	 it 	 s 	 	back	.
and	it	 open 	 s 	 	and	 close 	 s 	 	the	 shut 	 ter 	 	so	the	amount	of	light	coming	out	of	the	bottom	--	which	is	made	by	the	 bacter 	 ium 	 	--	 exact 	 ly 	 	 match 	 es 	 	how	much	light	 hit 	 s 	 	the	 s 	 quid 	 	's	back	,	so	the	 s 	 quid 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	a	shadow	.
it	 actual 	 ly 	 	uses	the	light	from	the	bacteria	to	counter	-	illuminate	 it 	 self 	 	in	an	anti	-	 pre 	 d 	 ation 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	so	 predator 	 s 	 	ca	n't	see	 it 	 s 	 	shadow	,	 calcul 	 ate 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 tra 	 ject 	 ory 	 	,	and	eat	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	like	the	 steal 	 th 	 	 bomb 	 er 	 	of	the	ocean	.
but	then	if	you	think	about	it	,	the	 s 	 quid 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 terr 	 ible 	 	problem	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	got	 th 	 is 	 	 dy 	 ing 	 	,	thick	culture	of	bacteria	and	it	ca	n't	sustain	that	.
and	so	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	every	 morn 	 ing 	 	when	the	 s 	 un 	 	 come 	 s 	 	up	the	 s 	 quid 	 	 go 	 es 	 	back	to	sleep	,	it	 bur 	 ies 	 	 it 	 self 	 	in	the	sand	,	and	it	's	got	a	pump	that	's	 attach 	 ed 	 	to	 it 	 s 	 	 circa 	 d 	 ian 	 	rhythm	,	and	when	the	 s 	 un 	 	 come 	 s 	 	up	it	 pump 	 s 	 	out	like	95	percent	of	the	bacteria	.
now	the	bacteria	are	 di 	 lute 	 	,	that	little	hormone	molecule	is	gone	,	so	they	're	not	making	light	--	but	of	course	the	 s 	 quid 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	care	.	it	's	 a 	 sleep 	 	in	the	sand	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	the	day	 go 	 es 	 	by	the	bacteria	double	,	they	 re 	 lease 	 	the	molecule	,	and	then	light	 come 	 s 	 	on	at	night	,	 exact 	 ly 	 	when	the	 s 	 quid 	 	 want 	 s 	 	it	.
first	we	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	how	 th 	 is 	 	 bacter 	 ium 	 	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	then	we	 br 	 ought 	 	the	 tool 	 s 	 	of	 mole 	 cular 	 	biology	to	 th 	 is 	 	to	figure	out	 re 	 ally 	 	what	's	the	 mechan 	 ism 	 	.
and	what	we	found	--	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	now	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	my	bacterial	cell	--	is	that	vibrio	 fisc 	 heri 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	protein	--	that	's	the	red	box	--	it	's	an	enzyme	that	 make 	 s 	 	that	little	hormone	molecule	,	the	red	triangle	.
and	then	 a 	 s 	 	the	 cell 	 s 	 	grow	,	they	're	all	 re 	 leas 	 ing 	 	that	molecule	 in 	 to 	 	the	environment	,	so	there	's	 lot 	 s 	 	of	molecule	there	.
and	the	bacteria	 al 	 so 	 	have	a	receptor	on	 the 	 ir 	 	cell	surface	that	 fit 	 s 	 	like	a	lock	and	key	with	that	molecule	.
these	are	just	like	the	 receptor 	 s 	 	on	the	 surface 	 s 	 	of	your	 cell 	 s 	 	.
when	the	molecule	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	to	a	certain	amount	--	which	 say 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	about	the	number	of	 cell 	 s 	 	--	it	 lock 	 s 	 	down	 in 	 to 	 	that	receptor	and	information	 come 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 cell 	 s 	 	that	 tell 	 s 	 	the	 cell 	 s 	 	to	turn	on	 th 	 is 	 	 collect 	 ive 	 	behavior	of	making	light	.
why	 th 	 is 	 	is	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	in	the	past	decade	we	have	found	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	just	some	 anomal 	 y 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	,	glow	-	in	-	the	-	dark	 bacter 	 ium 	 	that	 live 	 s 	 	in	the	ocean	--	all	bacteria	have	 system 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	now	what	we	understand	is	that	all	bacteria	can	talk	to	each	other	.
they	make	chemical	 word 	 s 	 	,	they	 recogn 	 ize 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 word 	 s 	 	,	and	they	turn	on	group	 behavior 	 s 	 	that	are	 on 	 ly 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	when	all	of	the	 cell 	 s 	 	 particip 	 ate 	 	in	 un 	 ison 	 	.
we	have	a	 f 	 ancy 	 	name	for	 th 	 is 	 	:	we	call	it	quorum	 sens 	 ing 	 	.
they	vote	with	these	chemical	 vote 	 s 	 	,	the	vote	 get 	 s 	 	 count 	 ed 	 	,	and	then	 every 	 body 	 	 respond 	 s 	 	to	the	vote	.
what	's	 import 	 ant 	 	for	 to 	 day 	 	's	talk	is	that	we	know	that	there	are	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 behavior 	 s 	 	that	bacteria	carry	out	in	these	 collect 	 ive 	 	 fashion 	 s 	 	.
but	the	one	that	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	to	you	is	 virul 	 ence 	 	.
it	's	not	like	a	couple	bacteria	get	in	you	and	they	start	 secret 	 ing 	 	some	 toxin 	 s 	 	--	you	're	enormous	,	that	would	have	no	effect	on	you	.	you	're	huge	.
what	they	do	,	we	now	understand	,	is	they	get	in	you	,	they	wait	,	they	start	growing	,	they	count	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	with	these	little	 molecule 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 recogn 	 ize 	 	when	they	have	the	right	cell	number	that	if	all	of	the	bacteria	launch	 the 	 ir 	 	 virul 	 ence 	 	attack	together	,	they	are	going	to	be	 success 	 ful 	 	at	 over 	 coming 	 	an	enormous	host	.
bacteria	 al 	 ways 	 	control	 pathogen 	 icity 	 	with	quorum	 sens 	 ing 	 	.
that	's	how	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	then	went	to	look	at	what	are	these	 molecule 	 s 	 	--	these	 we 	 re 	 	the	red	 triangle 	 s 	 	on	my	 slide 	 s 	 	before	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	vibrio	 fisc 	 heri 	 	molecule	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	word	that	it	 talk 	 s 	 	with	.
so	then	we	 start 	 ed 	 	to	look	at	other	bacteria	,	and	these	are	just	a	 s 	 matter 	 ing 	 	of	the	 molecule 	 s 	 	that	we	've	 discover 	 ed 	 	.
what	i	hope	you	can	see	is	that	the	 molecule 	 s 	 	are	related	.
the	left	-	hand	part	of	the	molecule	is	 ident 	 ical 	 	in	every	single	species	of	bacteria	.
but	the	right	-	hand	part	of	the	molecule	is	a	little	bit	different	in	every	single	species	.
what	that	 do 	 es 	 	is	to	confer	exquisite	species	 specific 	 ities 	 	to	these	 language 	 s 	 	.
each	molecule	 fit 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 it 	 s 	 	partner	receptor	and	no	other	.
so	these	are	private	,	secret	 conversation 	 s 	 	.
these	 conversation 	 s 	 	are	for	 intra 	 species 	 	communication	.
each	bacteria	uses	a	 part 	 icular 	 	molecule	that	's	 it 	 s 	 	language	that	 allow 	 s 	 	it	to	count	 it 	 s 	 	own	 s 	 i 	 bling 	 s 	 	.
once	we	got	that	far	we	thought	we	 we 	 re 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	to	understand	that	bacteria	have	these	social	 behavior 	 s 	 	.
but	what	we	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	is	that	most	of	the	time	bacteria	do	n't	live	by	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	they	live	in	 in 	 credible 	 	 mix 	 ture 	 s 	 	,	with	 hundred 	 s 	 	or	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	other	species	of	bacteria	.
and	that	's	 depict 	 ed 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	slide	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	your	skin	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	a	picture	--	a	 micro 	 graph 	 	of	your	skin	.
 any 	 where 	 	on	your	body	,	it	 look 	 s 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	like	 th 	 is 	 	,
and	what	i	hope	you	can	see	is	that	there	's	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	bacteria	there	.
and	so	we	 start 	 ed 	 	to	think	if	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	is	about	communication	in	bacteria	,	and	it	's	about	 count 	 ing 	 	your	 neighbor 	 s 	 	,	it	's	not	 en 	 ough 	 	to	be	able	to	 on 	 ly 	 	talk	 with 	 in 	 	your	species	.
there	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	a	way	to	take	a	census	of	the	rest	of	the	bacteria	in	the	population	.
so	we	went	back	to	 mole 	 cular 	 	biology	and	 start 	 ed 	 	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	different	bacteria	,	and	what	we	've	found	now	is	that	in	fact	,	bacteria	are	 multi 	 lingual 	 	.
they	all	have	a	species	-	specific	system	--	they	have	a	molecule	that	 say 	 s 	 	``	me	.	``
but	then	,	running	in	parallel	to	that	is	a	second	system	that	we	've	 discover 	 ed 	 	,	that	's	generic	.
so	,	they	have	a	second	enzyme	that	 make 	 s 	 	a	second	signal	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	own	receptor	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	molecule	is	the	trade	language	of	bacteria	.
it	's	used	by	all	different	bacteria	and	it	's	the	language	of	 inter 	 species 	 	communication	.
what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	that	bacteria	are	able	to	count	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	me	and	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	.
they	take	that	information	 in 	 side 	 	,	and	they	decide	what	 task 	 s 	 	to	carry	out	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	who	's	in	the	 minor 	 ity 	 	and	who	's	in	the	 major 	 ity 	 	of	any	 give 	 n 	 	population	.
then	 aga 	 in 	 	we	turn	to	 chemist 	 ry 	 	,	and	we	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	what	 th 	 is 	 	generic	molecule	is	--	that	was	the	pink	 ov 	 al 	 s 	 	on	my	last	slide	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	it	.
it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	,	five	-	carbon	molecule	.
what	the	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	is	that	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	is	that	every	 bacter 	 ium 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	enzyme	and	 make 	 s 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	molecule	.
so	they	're	all	using	 th 	 is 	 	molecule	for	 inter 	 species 	 	communication	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	bacterial	esperanto	.
once	we	got	that	far	,	we	 start 	 ed 	 	to	learn	that	bacteria	can	talk	to	each	other	with	 th 	 is 	 	chemical	language	.
but	what	we	 start 	 ed 	 	to	think	is	that	 may 	 be 	 	there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	practical	that	we	can	do	here	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
i	've	told	you	that	bacteria	do	have	all	these	social	 behavior 	 s 	 	,	they	communicate	with	these	 molecule 	 s 	 	.
of	course	,	i	've	 al 	 so 	 	told	you	that	one	of	the	 import 	 ant 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	they	do	is	to	 initi 	 ate 	 	 pathogen 	 icity 	 	using	quorum	 sens 	 ing 	 	.
we	thought	,	what	if	we	made	these	bacteria	so	they	ca	n't	talk	or	they	ca	n't	hear	?
could	n't	these	be	new	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 anti 	 biotic 	 s 	 	?
of	course	,	you	've	just	heard	and	you	 al 	 ready 	 	know	that	we	're	running	out	of	 anti 	 biotic 	 s 	 	.
bacteria	are	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	multi	-	drug	-	resistant	right	now	,	and	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	all	of	the	 anti 	 biotic 	 s 	 	that	we	use	kill	bacteria	.
they	either	pop	the	bacterial	membrane	,	they	make	the	 bacter 	 ium 	 	so	it	ca	n't	replicate	 it 	 s 	 	dna	.
we	kill	bacteria	with	 tradition 	 al 	 	 anti 	 biotic 	 s 	 	and	that	 select 	 s 	 	for	resistant	 mut 	 ants 	 	.
and	so	now	of	course	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	global	problem	in	 infect 	 ious 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	.
we	thought	,	well	what	if	we	could	sort	of	do	behavior	 mod 	 ification 	 s 	 	,	just	make	these	bacteria	so	they	ca	n't	talk	,	they	ca	n't	count	,	and	they	do	n't	know	to	launch	 virul 	 ence 	 	.
and	so	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	,	and	we	've	sort	of	taken	two	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	.
the	first	one	is	we	've	 target 	 ed 	 	the	 intra 	 species 	 	communication	system	.
so	we	made	 molecule 	 s 	 	that	look	kind	of	like	the	real	 molecule 	 s 	 	--	which	you	saw	--	but	they	're	a	little	bit	different	.
and	so	they	lock	 in 	 to 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 receptor 	 s 	 	,	and	they	jam	 re 	 cognition 	 	of	the	real	thing	.
by	 target 	 ing 	 	the	red	system	,	what	we	are	able	to	do	is	to	make	species	-	specific	,	or	disease	-	specific	,	anti	-	quorum	 sens 	 ing 	 	 molecule 	 s 	 	.
we	've	 al 	 so 	 	 d 	 one 	 	the	same	thing	with	the	pink	system	.
we	've	taken	that	universal	molecule	and	 turn 	 ed 	 	it	around	a	little	bit	so	that	we	've	made	 ant 	 agon 	 ists 	 	of	the	 inter 	 species 	 	communication	system	.
the	hope	is	that	these	will	be	used	 a 	 s 	 	broad	-	spectrum	 anti 	 biotic 	 s 	 
that	work	against	all	bacteria	.
to	finish	i	'll	just	show	you	the	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	one	i	'm	just	using	the	 inter 	 species 	 	molecule	,
but	the	logic	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	.
what	you	know	is	that	when	that	 bacter 	 ium 	 	 get 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	animal	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	a	mouse	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 initi 	 ate 	 	 virul 	 ence 	 	right	away	.
it	 get 	 s 	 	in	,	it	 start 	 s 	 	growing	,	it	 start 	 s 	 	 secret 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	quorum	 sens 	 ing 	 	 molecule 	 s 	 	.
it	 recogn 	 ize 	 s 	 	when	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	bacteria	that	now	they	're	going	to	launch	 the 	 ir 	 	attack	,	and	the	animal	dies	.
what	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	do	is	to	give	these	 virul 	 ent 	 	 infect 	 ions 	 	,	but	we	give	them	in	 con 	 junction 	 	with	our	anti	-	quorum	 sens 	 ing 	 	 molecule 	 s 	 	--	so	these	are	 molecule 	 s 	 	that	look	kind	of	like	the	real	thing	,	but	they	're	a	little	bit	different	which	i	've	 depict 	 ed 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	slide	.
what	we	now	know	is	that	if	we	treat	the	animal	with	a	 pathogen 	 ic 	 	 bacter 	 ium 	 	--	a	multi	-	drug	-	resistant	 pathogen 	 ic 	 	 bacter 	 ium 	 	--	in	the	same	time	we	give	our	anti	-	quorum	 sens 	 ing 	 	molecule	,	in	fact	,	the	animal	 live 	 s 	 	.
we	think	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	next	generation	of	 anti 	 biotic 	 s 	 	and	it	's	going	to	get	us	around	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	 initi 	 ally 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	big	problem	of	 resist 	 ance 	 	.
what	i	hope	you	think	,	is	that	bacteria	can	talk	to	each	other	,	they	use	 chemical 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 word 	 s 	 	,	they	have	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	chemical	 lexic 	 on 	 	that	we	're	just	now	 start 	 ing 	 	to	learn	about	.
of	course	what	that	 allow 	 s 	 	bacteria	to	do	is	to	be	 multi 	 cellular 	 	.
so	in	the	spirit	of	ted	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	together	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 make 	 s 	 	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	that	bacteria	have	these	 collect 	 ive 	 	 behavior 	 s 	 	,	and	they	can	carry	out	 task 	 s 	 	that	they	could	never	accomplish	if	they	 simpl 	 y 	 	 act 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	.
what	i	would	hope	that	i	could	further	 argu 	 e 	 	to	you	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 invent 	 ion 	 	of	 multi 	 cellular 	 ity 	 	.
bacteria	have	 be 	 en 	 	on	the	earth	for	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	;
 human 	 s 	 	,	couple	hundred	thousand	.
we	think	bacteria	made	the	 rule 	 s 	 	for	how	 multi 	 cellular 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	 work 	 s 	 	.
we	think	,	by	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	bacteria	,	we	're	going	to	be	able	to	have	 in 	 sight 	 	about	 multi 	 cellular 	 ity 	 	in	the	human	body	.
we	know	that	the	 principle 	 s 	 	and	the	 rule 	 s 	 	,	if	we	can	figure	them	out	in	these	sort	of	primitive	 organism 	 s 	 	,	the	hope	is	that	they	will	be	 appli 	 ed 	 	to	other	human	 disease 	 s 	 	and	human	 behavior 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
i	hope	that	what	you	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	is	that	bacteria	can	distinguish	self	from	other	.
by	using	these	two	 molecule 	 s 	 	they	can	say	``	me	``	and	they	can	say	``	you	.	``
 aga 	 in 	 	of	course	that	's	what	we	do	,	both	in	a	 mole 	 cular 	 	way	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	in	an	 out 	 ward 	 	way	,	but	i	think	about	the	 mole 	 cular 	 	stuff	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	 happen 	 s 	 	in	your	body	.
it	's	not	like	your	heart	 cell 	 s 	 	and	your	 kid 	 ney 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	get	all	 mix 	 ed 	 	up	every	day	,	and	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	 chemist 	 ry 	 	going	on	,	these	 molecule 	 s 	 	that	say	who	each	of	these	 group 	 s 	 	of	 cell 	 s 	 	is	,	and	what	 the 	 ir 	 	 task 	 s 	 	should	be	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	we	think	that	bacteria	 invent 	 ed 	 	that	,	and	you	've	just	 evolv 	 ed 	 	a	few	more	 bell 	 s 	 	and	 whistl 	 es 	 	,	but	all	of	the	 idea 	 s 	 	are	in	these	simple	 system 	 s 	 	that	we	can	 stud 	 y 	 	.
the	final	thing	is	,	 aga 	 in 	 	just	to	reiterate	that	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	practical	part	,	and	so	we	've	made	these	anti	-	quorum	 sens 	 ing 	 	 molecule 	 s 	 	that	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	new	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 therapeutic 	 s 	 	.
but	then	,	to	finish	with	a	plug	for	all	the	good	and	 miracul 	 ous 	 	bacteria	that	live	on	the	earth	,	we	've	 al 	 so 	 	made	pro	-	quorum	 sens 	 ing 	 	 molecule 	 s 	 	.
so	,	we	've	 target 	 ed 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 system 	 s 	 	to	make	the	 molecule 	 s 	 	work	better	.
remember	you	have	these	10	 time 	 s 	 	or	more	bacterial	 cell 	 s 	 	in	you	or	on	you	,	 keep 	 ing 	 	you	 health 	 y 	 	.
what	we	're	 al 	 so 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	is	to	beef	up	the	conversation	of	the	bacteria	that	live	 a 	 s 	 	 mutual 	 ists 	 	with	you	,	in	the	 hope 	 s 	 	of	making	you	more	 health 	 y 	 	,	making	 t 	 hose 	 	 conversation 	 s 	 	better	,	so	bacteria	can	do	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	want	them	to	do	better	than	they	would	be	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	.
 final 	 ly 	 	,	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	show	you	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	gang	at	princeton	,	new	jersey	.
 every 	 thing 	 	i	told	you	about	was	 discover 	 ed 	 	by	 some 	 one 	 	in	that	picture	.
i	hope	when	you	learn	 thing 	 s 	 	,	like	about	how	the	natural	world	 work 	 s 	 	--	i	just	want	to	say	that	 when 	 ever 	 	you	read	 some 	 thing 	 	in	the	 news 	 paper 	 	or	you	get	to	hear	some	talk	about	 some 	 thing 	 	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	in	the	natural	world	it	was	 d 	 one 	 	by	a	child	.
science	is	 d 	 one 	 	by	that	 demo 	 graphic 	 	.
all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	people	are	between	20	and	30	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	and	they	are	the	engine	that	 drive 	 s 	 	scientific	 discover 	 y 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	.
it	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	 demo 	 graphic 	 	to	work	with	.
i	keep	 get 	 ting 	 	 old 	 er 	 	and	 old 	 er 	 	and	they	're	 al 	 ways 	 	the	same	age	,	and	it	's	just	a	crazy	 de 	 light 	 ful 	 	job	.
i	want	to	thank	you	for	 invit 	 ing 	 	me	here	.
it	's	a	big	treat	for	me	to	get	to	come	to	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	.
 thank 	 s 	 	.
