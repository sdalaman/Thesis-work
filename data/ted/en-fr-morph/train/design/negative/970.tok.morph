welcome	to	thailand	.
now	,	when	i	was	a	young	man	--	40	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	the	country	was	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	poor	with	 lot 	 s 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	people	living	in	poverty	.
we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	it	,	but	we	did	n't	begin	with	a	 wel 	 fare 	 	program	or	a	poverty	 r 	 eduction 	 	program	.
but	we	 beg 	 an 	 	with	a	family	-	 plan 	 ning 	 	program	,	 follow 	 ing 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	 ma 	 ternal 	 	child	health	activity	,	 set 	 s 	 	of	 activ 	 ities 	 	.
so	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	no	one	would	accept	family	 plan 	 ning 	 	if	 the 	 ir 	 	children	did	n't	 surviv 	 e 	 	.
so	the	first	step	:	get	to	the	children	,	get	to	the	 mother 	 s 	 	,	and	then	follow	up	with	family	 plan 	 ning 	 	.
not	just	child	 mortal 	 ity 	 	 al 	 one 	 	,	you	need	 al 	 so 	 	family	 plan 	 ning 	 	.
now	let	me	take	you	back	 a 	 s 	 	to	why	we	 need 	 ed 	 	to	do	it	.
in	my	country	,	that	was	the	case	in	1974	.
seven	children	per	family	--
tremendous	growth	at	3.3	percent	.
there	was	just	no	future	.
we	 need 	 ed 	 	to	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	population	growth	rate	.
so	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	let	's	do	it	.	``
the	women	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	agree	.	we	'll	use	 pill 	 s 	 	,	but	we	need	a	doctor	to	 pre 	 scribe 	 	the	 pill 	 s 	 	,	``
and	we	had	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	few	 doctor 	 s 	 	.
we	did	n't	take	no	 a 	 s 	 	an	answer	;	we	took	no	 a 	 s 	 	a	question	.
we	went	to	the	 nurse 	 s 	 	and	the	 mid 	 wives 	 	,	who	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 so 	 	women	,	and	did	a	fantastic	job	at	 explain 	 ing 	 	how	to	use	the	pill	.
that	was	 wonder 	 ful 	 	,	but	it	 cover 	 ed 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	20	percent	of	the	country	.
what	do	we	do	for	the	other	80	percent	--	 leav 	 e 	 	them	 al 	 one 	 	and	say	,	``	well	,	they	're	not	medical	 person 	 nel 	 	.	``
no	,	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	do	a	bit	more	.
so	we	went	to	the	 ordin 	 ary 	 	people	that	you	saw	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 be 	 low 	 	that	yellow	sign	--	i	wish	they	had	n't	 wipe 	 d 	 	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	was	``	coca	-	 col 	 a 	 	``	there	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	so	much	 big 	 ger 	 	than	coca	-	 col 	 a 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 day 	 s 	 	.
and	no	 differ 	 ence 	 	,	the	people	they	chose	 we 	 re 	 	the	people	we	chose	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	well	-	known	in	the	community	,	they	 k 	 new 	 	that	 custom 	 ers 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	right	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 terr 	 ific 	 	,	and	they	 practice 	 d 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	family	 plan 	 ning 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
so	they	could	supply	 pill 	 s 	 	and	 condom 	 s 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	country	,	in	every	village	of	the	country	.
so	there	we	are	.	we	went	to	the	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 een 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	cause	of	the	problem	to	be	the	solution	.
 where 	 ver 	 	there	 we 	 re 	 	people	--	and	you	can	see	 boat 	 s 	 	with	the	women	,	selling	 thing 	 s 	 	--	here	's	the	 float 	 ing 	 	market	selling	 banana 	 s 	 	and	 crab 	 s 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	 con 	 traceptives 	 	--	 where 	 ver 	 	you	find	people	,	you	'll	find	 con 	 traceptives 	 	in	thailand	.
and	then	we	 decide 	 d 	 	,	why	not	get	to	 relig 	 ion 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	in	the	philippines	,	the	catholic	church	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	strong	,	and	thai	people	 we 	 re 	 	buddhist	.
we	went	to	them	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	look	,	could	you	help	us	?	``
i	'm	there	--	the	one	in	blue	,	not	the	yellow	--	 hold 	 ing 	 	a	bowl	of	holy	water	for	the	monk	to	 sprinkl 	 e 	 	holy	water	on	 pill 	 s 	 	and	 condom 	 s 	 	for	the	 sanct 	 ity 	 	of	the	family	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	picture	was	 s 	 ent 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	country	.
so	some	of	the	 monk 	 s 	 	in	the	 village 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	the	same	thing	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
and	the	women	 we 	 re 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	no	wonder	we	have	no	side	-	 effect 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 bless 	 ed 	 	.	``
that	was	 the 	 ir 	 	 per 	 ception 	 	.
and	then	we	went	to	 teacher 	 s 	 	.
you	need	 every 	 body 	 	to	be	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 try 	 ing 	 	to	provide	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	that	make	 human 	 ity 	 	a	better	place	.
so	we	went	to	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	.
over	a	quarter	of	a	million	 we 	 re 	 	taught	about	family	 plan 	 ning 	 	with	a	new	 alpha 	 bet 	 	--	a	,	b	for	birth	,	c	for	condom	,	i	for	iud	,	v	for	 va 	 s 	 ectomy 	 	.
and	then	we	had	a	 snake 	 s 	 	and	 lad 	 d 	 ers 	 	game	,	where	you	throw	 d 	 ice 	 	.
if	you	land	on	 any 	 thing 	 	pro	-	family	 plan 	 ning 	 	,	you	move	 a 	 head 	 	.
like	,	``	mother	 take 	 s 	 	the	pill	every	night	.
 ver 	 y 	 	good	,	mother	.	move	 a 	 head 	 	.
uncle	 buy 	 s 	 	a	condom	.	 ver 	 y 	 	good	,	uncle	.	move	 a 	 head 	 	.
uncle	 get 	 s 	 	drunk	,	 do 	 es 	 	n't	use	condom	.	come	back	,	start	 aga 	 in 	 	.	``
 aga 	 in 	 	,	education	,	class	 entertain 	 ment 	 	.
and	the	 kid 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	it	in	school	too	.
we	had	 re 	 lay 	 	 race 	 s 	 	with	 condom 	 s 	 	,
we	had	children	's	condom	-	 blow 	 ing 	 	 champion 	 ship 	 	.
and	before	long	,	the	condom	was	know	 a 	 s 	 	the	girl	's	best	friend	.
in	thailand	,	for	poor	people	,	 diamond 	 s 	 	do	n't	make	it	--
so	the	condom	is	the	girl	's	best	friend	.
we	 introduc 	 ed 	 	our	first	 micro 	 credit 	 	program	in	1975	,	and	the	women	who	 organize 	 d 	 	it	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	 on 	 ly 	 	want	to	lend	to	women	who	practice	family	 plan 	 ning 	 	.
if	you	're	 pregn 	 ant 	 	,	take	care	of	your	 pregn 	 ancy 	 	.
if	you	're	not	 pregn 	 ant 	 	,	you	can	take	a	loan	out	from	us	.	``	and	that	was	run	by	them	.
and	after	35/36	 year 	 s 	 	,	it	's	still	going	on	.
it	's	a	part	of	the	village	 develop 	 ment 	 	bank	;
it	's	not	a	real	bank	,	but	it	's	a	fund	--	 micro 	 credit 	 	.
and	we	did	n't	need	a	big	 organ 	 ization 	 	to	run	it	--
it	was	run	by	the	 village 	 rs 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
and	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	 hard 	 ly 	 	see	a	thai	man	there	,
it	's	 al 	 ways 	 	women	,	women	,	women	,	women	.
and	then	we	thought	we	'd	help	america	,	 be 	 cause 	 	america	's	 be 	 en 	 	 help 	 ing 	 	 every 	 one 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	they	want	help	or	not	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	on	the	fourth	of	july	.
we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	provide	 va 	 s 	 ectomy 	 	to	all	men	,	but	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	american	men	to	the	front	of	the	queue	,	right	up	to	the	ambassador	's	residence	 dur 	 ing 	 	his	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	.
and	the	hotel	 g 	 ave 	 	us	the	 ball 	 room 	 	for	it	--
 ver 	 y 	 	appropriate	room	.
and	since	it	was	near	lunch	time	,	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	all	right	,	we	'll	give	you	some	lunch	.
of	course	,	it	must	be	american	 col 	 a 	 	.
you	get	two	 brand 	 s 	 	,	 co 	 ke 	 	and	pepsi	.
and	then	the	food	is	either	 ham 	 burger 	 	or	 hot 	 dog 	 	.	``	and	i	thought	a	 hot 	 dog 	 	will	be	more	 symbol 	 ic 	 	.
and	here	is	 th 	 is 	 	,	then	,	young	man	 call 	 ed 	 	 will 	 y 	 	bohm	who	 work 	 ed 	 	for	the	usaid	.
 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	he	's	had	his	 va 	 s 	 ectomy 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	his	 hot 	 dog 	 	is	half	eaten	,	and	he	was	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	.
it	made	a	lot	of	news	in	america	,	and	it	 anger 	 ed 	 	some	people	 al 	 so 	 	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	do	n't	worry	.	come	over	and	i	'll	do	the	whole	lot	of	you	.	``
and	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	?
in	all	 th 	 is 	 	thing	,	from	seven	children	to	1.5	children	,
population	growth	rate	of	3.3	to	0.5	.
you	could	call	it	the	coca	-	 col 	 a 	 	approach	if	you	like	--
it	was	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	thing	.
i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	coca	-	 col 	 a 	 	 follow 	 ed 	 	us	,	or	we	 follow 	 ed 	 	coca	-	 col 	 a 	 	,	but	we	're	good	 friend 	 s 	 	.
and	so	that	's	the	case	of	 every 	 one 	 	 join 	 ing 	 	in	.
we	did	n't	have	a	strong	government	.	we	did	n't	have	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 doctor 	 s 	 	.
but	it	's	 every 	 body 	 	's	job	who	can	change	attitude	and	behavior	.
then	 aid 	 s 	 	came	 a 	 long 	 	and	hit	thailand	,	and	we	had	to	stop	 do 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	good	 thing 	 s 	 	to	fight	 aid 	 s 	 	.
but	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	the	government	was	in	 deni 	 al 	 	,	 deni 	 al 	 	,	 deni 	 al 	 	.
so	our	work	was	n't	 affect 	 ed 	 	.
so	i	thought	,	``	well	,	if	you	ca	n't	go	to	the	government	,	go	to	the	 militar 	 y 	 	.	``
so	i	went	to	the	 militar 	 y 	 	and	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	borrow	300	radio	 station 	 s 	 	.
they	have	more	than	the	government	,	and	they	've	got	more	 gun 	 s 	 	than	the	government	.
so	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	,	could	they	help	us	in	our	fight	against	hiv	.
and	after	i	 g 	 ave 	 	them	 statistic 	 s 	 	,
they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	you	can	use	all	the	radio	 station 	 s 	 	,	 tele 	 vision 	 	 station 	 s 	 	.	``
and	that	's	when	we	went	onto	the	 air 	 wave 	 s 	 	.
and	then	we	got	a	new	prime	 mini 	 ster 	 	soon	after	that	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	mechai	,	could	you	come	and	join	?	``
he	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	in	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 like 	 d 	 	my	wife	a	lot	.
so	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	``
he	 be 	 came 	 	the	 chair 	 man 	 	of	the	national	 aid 	 s 	 	 commit 	 tee 	 	and	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	the	budget	fifty	-	fold	.
every	 mini 	 stry 	 	,	even	 judg 	 es 	 	,	had	to	be	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 aid 	 s 	 	education	--
 every 	 one 	 	--	and	we	 s 	 aid 	 	the	public	,	 institution 	 s 	 	,	religious	 institution 	 s 	 	,	 school 	 s 	 	--	 every 	 one 	 	was	 involve 	 d 	 	.
and	here	,	every	media	person	had	to	be	trained	for	hiv	.
and	we	 g 	 ave 	 	every	station	half	a	minute	extra	for	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	to	earn	more	money	.
so	they	 we 	 re 	 	happy	with	that	.
and	then	 aid 	 s 	 	education	in	all	 school 	 s 	 	,	 start 	 ing 	 	from	university	.
and	these	are	high	school	 kid 	 s 	 	 teach 	 ing 	 	high	school	 kid 	 s 	 	.
and	the	best	 teacher 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	the	 girl 	 s 	 	,	not	the	 boy 	 s 	 	,
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 terr 	 ific 	 	.
and	these	 girl 	 s 	 	who	go	around	 teach 	 ing 	 	about	safe	 s 	 ex 	 	and	hiv	 we 	 re 	 	known	 a 	 s 	 	mother	theresa	.
and	then	we	went	down	one	more	step	.
these	are	 prim 	 ary 	 	school	 kid 	 s 	 	--	third	,	fourth	grade	--	going	to	every	 house 	 hold 	 	in	the	village	,	every	 house 	 hold 	 	in	the	whole	of	thailand	,	giving	 aid 	 s 	 	information	and	a	condom	to	every	 house 	 hold 	 	,	 give 	 n 	 	by	these	young	 kid 	 s 	 	.
and	no	 parent 	 s 	 	 object 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 s 	 ave 	 	 live 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	 life 	 saver 	 	.
and	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 every 	 one 	 	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 involve 	 d 	 	.	``
so	you	have	the	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 real 	 izing 	 	that	sick	staff	do	n't	work	,	and	dead	 custom 	 ers 	 	do	n't	buy	.
so	they	all	trained	.
and	then	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	 cap 	 tain 	 	condom	,	with	his	harvard	mba	,	going	to	 school 	 s 	 	and	night	 spot 	 s 	 	.	and	they	 love 	 d 	 	him	.	you	need	a	symbol	of	 some 	 thing 	 	.
in	every	country	,	every	program	,	you	need	a	symbol	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	best	thing	he	's	ever	 d 	 one 	 	with	his	mba	.
and	then	we	 g 	 ave 	 	 condom 	 s 	 	out	 every 	 where 	 	on	the	 street 	 s 	 	--	 every 	 where 	 	,	 every 	 where 	 	.
in	 taxi 	 s 	 	,	you	get	 condom 	 s 	 	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	,	in	traffic	,	the	 police 	 men 	 	give	you	 condom 	 s 	 	--	our	``	 cop 	 s 	 	and	 rubber 	 s 	 	``	 program 	 s 	 	.
so	,	can	you	imagine	new	york	 police 	 men 	 	giving	out	 condom 	 s 	 	?
of	course	i	can	.	and	they	'd	enjoy	it	 immense 	 ly 	 	;
i	see	them	 stand 	 ing 	 	around	right	now	,	 every 	 where 	 	.
imagine	if	they	had	 condom 	 s 	 	,	giving	out	to	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	people	.
and	then	,	new	change	,	we	had	hair	 band 	 s 	 	,	 cloth 	 ing 	 	and	the	condom	for	your	mobile	phone	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	 rain 	 y 	 	season	.
and	these	 we 	 re 	 	the	 condom 	 s 	 	that	we	 introduc 	 ed 	 	.
one	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	weapon	of	mass	 protect 	 ion 	 	.	``
we	found	--
you	know	--	 some 	 body 	 	here	was	 search 	 ing 	 	for	the	weapon	of	mass	 destruct 	 ion 	 	,	but	we	have	found	the	weapon	of	mass	 protect 	 ion 	 	:	the	condom	.
and	then	it	 say 	 s 	 	here	,	with	the	american	flag	,	``	do	n't	 leav 	 e 	 	home	 with 	 out 	 	it	.	``
but	i	have	some	to	give	out	 after 	 ward 	 	.
but	let	me	 war 	 n 	 	you	,	these	are	thai	-	sized	,	so	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 care 	 ful 	 	.
and	so	you	can	see	that	 condom 	 s 	 	can	do	so	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
look	at	 th 	 is 	 	--
i	 g 	 ave 	 	 th 	 is 	 	to	al	gore	and	to	bill	senior	 al 	 so 	 	.
stop	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	;	use	 condom 	 s 	 	.
and	then	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	picture	i	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	to	you	--	the	weapon	of	mass	 protect 	 ion 	 	.
and	let	the	next	olympics	 s 	 ave 	 	some	 live 	 s 	 	.
why	just	run	around	?
and	then	 final 	 ly 	 	,	in	thailand	we	're	buddhist	,	we	do	n't	have	a	god	,
so	 in 	 stead 	 	,	we	say	,	``	in	rubber	we	trust	.	``	so	you	can	see	that	we	 add 	 ed 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	to	our	endeavor	to	make	life	better	for	the	people	.
we	had	 condom 	 s 	 	in	all	the	 refrige 	 rator 	 s 	 	in	the	 hotel 	 s 	 	and	the	 school 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	alcohol	 impair 	 s 	 	judgment	.
and	then	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	?
after	all	 th 	 is 	 	time	,	 every 	 body 	 	 join 	 ed 	 	in	.
 accord 	 ing 	 	to	the	u.n.	,	new	 case 	 s 	 	of	hiv	 decline 	 d 	 	by	90	percent	,
and	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	the	world	bank	,	7.7	million	 live 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	.
 other 	 wise 	 	there	would	n't	be	 man 	 y 	 	thais	 walk 	 ing 	 	around	 to 	 day 	 	.
so	it	just	 show 	 ed 	 	you	,	you	could	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	it	.
90	percent	of	the	 fund 	 ing 	 	came	from	thailand	.
there	was	 politic 	 al 	 	 commit 	 ment 	 	,	some	financial	 commit 	 ment 	 	,	and	 every 	 body 	 	 join 	 ed 	 	in	the	fight	.
so	just	do	n't	 leav 	 e 	 	it	to	the	 special 	 ists 	 	and	 doctor 	 s 	 	and	 nurse 	 s 	 	.
we	all	need	to	help	.
and	then	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	help	people	out	of	poverty	,	now	that	we	got	 aid 	 s 	 	 some 	 what 	 	out	of	the	way	--	 th 	 is 	 	time	,	not	with	government	 al 	 one 	 	,	but	in	 co 	 operation 	 	with	the	business	community	.
 be 	 cause 	 	poor	people	are	business	people	who	lack	business	 skill 	 s 	 	and	access	to	credit	.
 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	 thing 	 s 	 	to	be	 provide 	 d 	 	by	the	business	community	.
we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	turn	them	 in 	 to 	 	 bare 	 foot 	 	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	,	little	business	people	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	out	of	poverty	is	through	business	enterprise	.
so	,	that	was	 d 	 one 	 	.
the	money	 go 	 es 	 	from	the	company	 in 	 to 	 	the	village	via	tree	-	 plant 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	not	a	free	gift	.
they	plant	the	 tree 	 s 	 	,	and	the	money	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 micro 	 credit 	 	fund	,	which	we	call	the	village	 develop 	 ment 	 	bank	.
 every 	 body 	 	 join 	 s 	 	in	,	and	they	feel	they	own	the	bank	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	have	 br 	 ought 	 	the	money	in	.
and	before	you	can	borrow	the	money	,	you	need	to	be	trained	.
and	we	 believ 	 e 	 	if	you	want	to	help	the	poor	,	 t 	 hose 	 	who	are	living	in	poverty	,	access	to	credit	must	be	a	human	right	.
access	to	credit	must	be	a	human	right	.
 other 	 wise 	 	they	'll	never	get	out	of	poverty	.
and	then	before	 get 	 ting 	 	a	loan	,	you	must	be	trained	.
