suppose	that	two	american	 friend 	 s 	 	are	 travel 	 ing 	 	together	in	italy	.	they	go	to	see	michelangelo	's	``	david	,	``	and	when	they	 final 	 ly 	 	come	face	to	face	with	the	statue	,	they	both	freeze	dead	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 track 	 s 	 	.
the	first	guy	--	we	'll	call	him	adam	--	is	 trans 	 fix 	 ed 	 	by	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	of	the	perfect	human	form	.
the	second	guy	--	we	'll	call	him	bill	--	is	 trans 	 fix 	 ed 	 	by	 embarrass 	 ment 	 	,	at	 star 	 ing 	 	at	the	thing	there	in	the	center	.
so	here	's	my	question	for	you	:	which	one	of	these	two	 guy 	 s 	 	was	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	have	 vot 	 ed 	 	for	george	bush	,	which	for	al	gore	?
i	do	n't	need	a	show	of	 hand 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	all	have	the	same	 politic 	 al 	 	 stereo 	 type 	 s 	 	.
we	all	know	that	it	's	bill	.
and	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	the	 stereo 	 type 	 	 correspond 	 s 	 	to	 re 	 ality 	 	.
it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	a	fact	that	 liberal 	 s 	 	are	much	 high 	 er 	 	than	 conserv 	 ative 	 s 	 	on	a	major	 personal 	 ity 	 	trait	 call 	 ed 	 	 open 	 ness 	 	to	experience	.
people	who	are	high	in	 open 	 ness 	 	to	experience	just	 crav 	 e 	 	 novel 	 ty 	 	,	 varie 	 ty 	 	,	 divers 	 ity 	 	,	new	 idea 	 s 	 	,	travel	.
people	low	on	it	like	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	familiar	,	that	are	safe	and	 depend 	 able 	 	.
if	you	know	about	 th 	 is 	 	trait	,	you	can	understand	a	lot	of	 puzzl 	 es 	 	about	human	behavior	.
you	can	understand	why	 artist 	 s 	 	are	so	different	from	 account 	 ants 	 	.
you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	predict	what	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 book 	 s 	 	they	like	to	read	,	what	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 place 	 s 	 	they	like	to	travel	to	,	and	what	 kind 	 s 	 	of	food	they	like	to	eat	.
once	you	understand	 th 	 is 	 	trait	,	you	can	understand	why	 any 	 body 	 	would	eat	at	applebee	's	,	but	not	 any 	 body 	 	that	you	know	.
 th 	 is 	 	trait	 al 	 so 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	us	a	lot	about	 politic 	 s 	 	.
the	main	 research 	 er 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	trait	,	robert	mccrae	 say 	 s 	 	that	,	``	open	 individual 	 s 	 	have	an	 affin 	 ity 	 	for	liberal	,	 progress 	 ive 	 	,	left	-	wing	 politic 	 al 	 	 view 	 s 	 	``	--	they	like	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	which	is	open	and	changing	--	``	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	closed	 individual 	 s 	 	prefer	 conserv 	 ative 	 	,	 tradition 	 al 	 	,	right	-	wing	 view 	 s 	 	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	trait	 al 	 so 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	us	a	lot	about	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 group 	 s 	 	people	join	.
so	here	's	the	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	of	a	group	i	found	on	the	web	.
what	 kind 	 s 	 	of	people	would	join	a	global	community	 wel 	 coming 	 	people	from	every	discipline	and	culture	,	who	seek	a	 deep 	 er 	 	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	the	world	,	and	who	hope	to	turn	that	 understand 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	better	future	for	us	all	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	from	some	guy	named	ted	.
well	,	let	's	see	now	,	if	 open 	 ness 	 	 predict 	 s 	 	who	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	liberal	,	and	 open 	 ness 	 	 predict 	 s 	 	who	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	tedster	,	then	might	we	predict	that	most	tedsters	are	liberal	?
i	'm	going	to	ask	you	to	raise	your	hand	,	 whet 	 her 	 	you	are	liberal	,	left	of	center	--	on	social	 issue 	 s 	 	,	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	,	 prim 	 arily 	 	--	or	 conserv 	 ative 	 	,	and	i	'll	give	a	third	option	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	know	there	are	a	number	of	 libertarian 	 s 	 	in	the	audience	.
so	,	right	now	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	raise	your	hand	--	down	in	the	 simul 	 cast 	 	rooms	,	too	,	let	's	let	 every 	 body 	 	see	who	's	here	--
 pleas 	 e 	 	raise	your	hand	if	you	would	say	that	you	are	liberal	or	left	of	center	.
 pleas 	 e 	 	raise	your	hand	high	right	now	.	ok	.
 pleas 	 e 	 	raise	your	hand	if	you	'd	say	you	're	libertarian	.
ok	,	about	a	--	two	dozen	.
and	 pleas 	 e 	 	raise	your	hand	if	you	'd	say	you	are	right	of	center	or	 conserv 	 ative 	 	.
one	,	two	,	three	,	four	,	five	--	about	eight	or	10	.
ok	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	bit	of	a	problem	.
 be 	 cause 	 	if	our	goal	is	to	understand	the	world	,	to	seek	a	 deep 	 er 	 	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	the	world	,	our	general	lack	of	moral	 divers 	 ity 	 	here	is	going	to	make	it	 hard 	 er 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	when	people	all	share	 value 	 s 	 	,	when	people	all	share	 moral 	 s 	 	,	they	 be 	 come 	 	a	team	,	and	once	you	engage	the	 psycho 	 logy 	 	of	 team 	 s 	 	,	it	 shut 	 s 	 	down	open	-	minded	 think 	 ing 	 	.
when	the	liberal	team	 lose 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	did	in	2004	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	it	 al 	 most 	 	did	in	2000	,	we	comfort	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
we	try	to	explain	why	half	of	america	 vot 	 ed 	 	for	the	other	team	.
we	think	they	must	be	 blind 	 ed 	 	by	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	or	by	simple	 stupid 	 ity 	 	.
so	,	if	you	think	that	half	of	america	 vote 	 s 	 	republican	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	 blind 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	,	then	my	 mess 	 age 	 	to	you	is	that	you	're	trapped	in	a	moral	 m 	 atrix 	 	,	in	a	 part 	 icular 	 	moral	 m 	 atrix 	 	.
and	by	the	 m 	 atrix 	 	,	i	mean	 liter 	 ally 	 	the	 m 	 atrix 	 	,	like	the	movie	``	the	 m 	 atrix 	 	.	``
but	i	'm	here	 to 	 day 	 	to	give	you	a	choice	.
you	can	either	take	the	blue	pill	and	stick	to	your	 comfort 	 ing 	 	 delusion 	 s 	 	,	or	you	can	take	the	red	pill	,	learn	some	moral	 psycho 	 logy 	 	and	step	 out 	 side 	 	the	moral	 m 	 atrix 	 	.
now	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	know	--	--	ok	,	i	 assum 	 e 	 	that	 answer 	 s 	 	my	question	.
i	was	going	to	ask	you	which	one	you	 pick 	 ed 	 	,	but	no	need	.
you	're	all	high	in	 open 	 ness 	 	to	experience	,	and	 be 	 side 	 s 	 	,	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	it	might	even	taste	good	,	and	you	're	all	 epic 	 ures 	 	.
so	 any 	 way 	 	,	let	's	go	with	the	red	pill	.
let	's	 stud 	 y 	 	some	moral	 psycho 	 logy 	 	and	see	where	it	 take 	 s 	 	us	.
let	's	start	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
what	is	 moral 	 ity 	 	and	where	 do 	 es 	 	it	come	from	?
the	worst	idea	in	all	of	 psycho 	 logy 	 	is	the	idea	that	the	mind	is	a	blank	 s 	 late 	 	at	birth	.
 develop 	 mental 	 	 psycho 	 logy 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 show 	 n 	 	that	 kid 	 s 	 	come	 in 	 to 	 	the	world	 al 	 ready 	 	 know 	 ing 	 	so	much	about	the	physical	and	social	 world 	 s 	 	,	and	 programm 	 ed 	 	to	make	it	 re 	 ally 	 	easy	for	them	to	learn	certain	 thing 	 s 	 	and	hard	to	learn	 other 	 s 	 	.
the	best	definition	of	 innate 	 ness 	 	i	've	ever	 s 	 een 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	just	 clar 	 ifies 	 	so	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	for	me	--	is	from	the	brain	scientist	gary	marcus	.
he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	the	 initi 	 al 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	of	the	brain	 do 	 es 	 	not	depend	that	much	on	experience	.
nature	 provide 	 s 	 	a	first	draft	,	which	experience	then	 revise 	 s 	 	.
built	-	in	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	 un 	 malle 	 able 	 	;	it	 mean 	 s 	 	 organize 	 d 	 	in	advance	of	experience	.	``
ok	,	so	what	's	on	the	first	draft	of	the	moral	mind	?
to	find	out	,	my	 col 	 league 	 	,	craig	joseph	,	and	i	read	through	the	 liter 	 ature 	 	on	 anthropo 	 logy 	 	,	on	culture	 vari 	 ation 	 	in	 moral 	 ity 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	on	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 psycho 	 logy 	 	,	looking	for	 match 	 es 	 	.
what	are	the	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	people	talk	about	 a 	 cross 	 	 discipline 	 s 	 	?	that	you	find	 a 	 cross 	 	 culture 	 s 	 	and	even	 a 	 cross 	 	species	?
we	found	five	--	five	best	 match 	 es 	 	,	which	we	call	the	five	 found 	 ations 	 	of	 moral 	 ity 	 	.
the	first	one	is	harm	/	care	.
we	're	all	 mammal 	 s 	 	here	,	we	all	have	a	lot	of	neural	and	hormonal	 programm 	 ing 	 	that	 make 	 s 	 	us	 re 	 ally 	 	bond	with	 other 	 s 	 	,	care	for	 other 	 s 	 	,	feel	 compass 	 ion 	 	for	 other 	 s 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	the	weak	and	 vulner 	 able 	 	.
it	 give 	 s 	 	us	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	about	 t 	 hose 	 	who	cause	harm	.
 th 	 is 	 	moral	 found 	 ation 	 	 under 	 lies 	 	about	70	percent	of	the	moral	 state 	 ments 	 	i	've	heard	here	at	ted	.
the	second	 found 	 ation 	 	is	 fair 	 ness 	 	/	 reciproc 	 ity 	 	.
there	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ambigu 	 ous 	 	evidence	 a 	 s 	 	to	 whet 	 her 	 	you	find	 reciproc 	 ity 	 	in	other	 animal 	 s 	 	,	but	the	evidence	for	people	could	not	be	 clear 	 er 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	norman	rockwell	 paint 	 ing 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	 gold 	 en 	 	rule	,	``	and	we	heard	about	 th 	 is 	 	from	karen	armstrong	,	of	course	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	 found 	 ation 	 	of	so	 man 	 y 	 	 relig 	 ions 	 	.
that	second	 found 	 ation 	 	 under 	 lies 	 	the	other	30	percent	of	the	moral	 state 	 ments 	 	i	've	heard	here	at	ted	.
the	third	 found 	 ation 	 	is	in	-	group	/	 loyal 	 ty 	 	.
you	do	find	 group 	 s 	 	in	the	animal	 king 	 dom 	 	--	you	do	find	 co 	 operative 	 	 group 	 s 	 	--	but	these	 group 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 ways 	 	either	 ver 	 y 	 	small	or	they	're	all	 s 	 i 	 bling 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	among	 human 	 s 	 	that	you	find	 ver 	 y 	 	large	 group 	 s 	 	of	people	who	are	able	to	cooperate	,	join	together	 in 	 to 	 	 group 	 s 	 	,	but	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	 group 	 s 	 	that	are	 unit 	 ed 	 	to	fight	other	 group 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 prob 	 ably 	 	 come 	 s 	 	from	our	long	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 trib 	 al 	 	living	,	of	 trib 	 al 	 	 psycho 	 logy 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 trib 	 al 	 	 psycho 	 logy 	 	is	so	 deep 	 ly 	 	 pleas 	 ur 	 able 	 	that	even	when	we	do	n't	have	 tribe 	 s 	 	,	we	go	 a 	 head 	 	and	make	them	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 f 	 un 	 	.
 s 	 port 	 s 	 	is	to	war	 a 	 s 	 	 porn 	 ography 	 	is	to	 s 	 ex 	 	.
we	get	to	 exercis 	 e 	 	some	ancient	,	ancient	 drive 	 s 	 	.
the	fourth	 found 	 ation 	 	is	 author 	 ity 	 	/	respect	.
here	you	see	 sub 	 mis 	 s 	 ive 	 	 gest 	 ures 	 	from	two	 member 	 s 	 	of	 ver 	 y 	 	 close 	 ly 	 	related	species	.	but	 author 	 ity 	 	in	 human 	 s 	 	is	not	so	 close 	 ly 	 	based	on	power	and	 brutal 	 ity 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	in	other	 prim 	 ates 	 	.
it	's	based	on	more	voluntary	 de 	 ference 	 	,	and	even	 element 	 s 	 	of	love	,	at	 time 	 s 	 	.
the	fifth	 found 	 ation 	 	is	 pur 	 ity 	 	/	 sanct 	 ity 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	 alle 	 gory 	 	of	chastity	,	``	but	 pur 	 ity 	 	's	not	just	about	 suppress 	 ing 	 	female	 sexual 	 ity 	 	.
it	's	about	any	kind	of	 ideo 	 logy 	 	,	any	kind	of	idea	that	 tell 	 s 	 	you	that	you	can	attain	virtue	by	 controll 	 ing 	 	what	you	do	with	your	body	,	by	 controll 	 ing 	 	what	you	put	 in 	 to 	 	your	body	.
and	while	the	 politic 	 al 	 	right	may	moralize	 s 	 ex 	 	much	more	,	the	 politic 	 al 	 	left	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	it	with	food	.
food	is	 be 	 coming 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 moralize 	 d 	 	 now 	 a 	 day 	 s 	 	,	and	a	lot	of	it	is	 idea 	 s 	 	about	 pur 	 ity 	 	,	about	what	you	're	 will 	 ing 	 	to	touch	,	or	put	 in 	 to 	 	your	body	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	these	are	the	five	best	 candid 	 ates 	 	for	what	's	written	on	the	first	draft	of	the	moral	mind	.
i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	come	with	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	a	 prepared 	 ness 	 	to	learn	all	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	my	son	,	max	,	 grow 	 s 	 	up	in	a	liberal	college	town	,	how	is	 th 	 is 	 	first	draft	going	to	get	 revise 	 d 	 	?
and	how	will	it	end	up	 be 	 ing 	 	different	from	a	kid	born	60	 mile 	 s 	 	south	of	us	in	lynchburg	,	virginia	?
to	think	about	culture	 vari 	 ation 	 	,	let	's	try	a	different	metaphor	.
if	there	 re 	 ally 	 	are	five	 system 	 s 	 	at	work	in	the	mind	--	five	 source 	 s 	 	of	 intuit 	 ions 	 	and	 emotion 	 s 	 	--	then	we	can	think	of	the	moral	mind	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	like	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	audio	 equal 	 izer 	 s 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	five	 channel 	 s 	 	,	where	you	can	set	it	to	a	different	setting	on	every	channel	.
and	my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	,	brian	nosek	and	jesse	graham	,	and	i	,	made	a	 question 	 naire 	 	,	which	we	put	up	on	the	web	at	www.yourmorals.org	.
and	so	far	,	30,000	people	have	taken	 th 	 is 	 	 question 	 naire 	 	,	and	you	can	too	.
here	are	the	 result 	 s 	 	.
here	are	the	 result 	 s 	 	from	about	23,000	american	 citizen 	 s 	 	.
on	the	left	,	i	've	 plot 	 ted 	 	the	 score 	 s 	 	for	 liberal 	 s 	 	;	on	the	right	,	 t 	 hose 	 	for	 conserv 	 ative 	 s 	 	;	in	the	middle	,	the	 moderate 	 s 	 	.
the	blue	line	 show 	 s 	 	you	people	's	 respons 	 es 	 	on	the	average	of	all	the	harm	 question 	 s 	 	.
so	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	see	,	people	care	about	harm	and	care	 issue 	 s 	 	.
they	give	high	 endorse 	 ment 	 	of	these	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 state 	 ments 	 	all	 a 	 cross 	 	the	board	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	you	 al 	 so 	 	see	,	 liberal 	 s 	 	care	about	it	a	little	more	than	 conserv 	 ative 	 s 	 	--	the	line	 slop 	 es 	 	down	.
same	story	for	 fair 	 ness 	 	.
but	look	at	the	other	three	lines	.	for	 liberal 	 s 	 	,	the	 score 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	low	.
 liberal 	 s 	 	are	 bas 	 ically 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	no	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 moral 	 ity 	 	.
in	-	group	,	 author 	 ity 	 	,	 pur 	 ity 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	 ha 	 s 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	 moral 	 ity 	 	.	i	reject	it	.	``
but	 a 	 s 	 	people	get	more	 conserv 	 ative 	 	,	the	 value 	 s 	 	rise	.
we	can	say	that	 liberal 	 s 	 	have	a	kind	of	a	two	-	channel	,	or	two	-	 found 	 ation 	 	 moral 	 ity 	 	.
 conserv 	 ative 	 s 	 	have	more	of	a	five	-	 found 	 ation 	 	,	or	five	-	channel	 moral 	 ity 	 	.
we	find	 th 	 is 	 	in	every	country	we	look	at	.
here	's	the	data	for	1,100	canadians	.
i	'll	just	flip	through	a	few	other	 slide 	 s 	 	.
the	u.k.	,	australia	,	new	zealand	,	western	europe	,	eastern	europe	,	latin	america	,	the	middle	east	,	east	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	and	south	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	.
notice	 al 	 so 	 	that	on	all	of	these	 graph 	 s 	 	,	the	 slop 	 e 	 	is	 steep 	 er 	 	on	in	-	group	,	 author 	 ity 	 	,	 pur 	 ity 	 	.
which	 show 	 s 	 	that	 with 	 in 	 	any	country	,	the	 disagree 	 ment 	 	is	n't	over	harm	and	 fair 	 ness 	 	.	 every 	 body 	 	--	i	mean	,	we	debate	over	what	's	fair	--	but	 every 	 body 	 	 agree 	 s 	 	that	harm	and	 fair 	 ness 	 	matter	.
moral	 argument 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	 culture 	 s 	 	are	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	about	 issue 	 s 	 	of	in	-	group	,	 author 	 ity 	 	,	 pur 	 ity 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	effect	is	so	 ro 	 bust 	 	that	we	find	it	no	matter	how	we	ask	the	question	.
in	one	 re 	 cent 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	,	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	people	to	suppose	you	're	about	to	get	a	dog	.
you	 pick 	 ed 	 	a	 part 	 icular 	 	breed	,	you	 learn 	 ed 	 	some	new	information	about	the	breed	.
suppose	you	learn	that	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	breed	is	 in 	 dependent 	 	-	minded	,	and	 relat 	 es 	 	to	 it 	 s 	 	owner	 a 	 s 	 	a	friend	and	an	equal	?
well	,	if	you	are	a	liberal	,	you	say	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	that	's	great	!	``
 be 	 cause 	 	 liberal 	 s 	 	like	to	say	,	``	fetch	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	.	``
but	if	you	're	 conserv 	 ative 	 	,	that	's	not	so	 attract 	 ive 	 	.
if	you	're	 conserv 	 ative 	 	,	and	you	learn	that	a	dog	's	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	loyal	to	 it 	 s 	 	home	and	family	,	and	 do 	 es 	 	n't	warm	up	 quick 	 ly 	 	to	 strange 	 rs 	 	,	for	 conserv 	 ative 	 s 	 	,	well	,	 loyal 	 ty 	 	is	good	--	 dog 	 s 	 	ought	to	be	loyal	.
but	to	a	liberal	,	it	 sound 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	dog	is	running	for	the	republican	 nomi 	 nation 	 	.
so	,	you	might	say	,	ok	,	there	are	these	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	between	 liberal 	 s 	 	and	 conserv 	 ative 	 s 	 	,	but	what	 make 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	three	other	 found 	 ations 	 	moral	?
are	n't	 t 	 hose 	 	just	the	 found 	 ations 	 	of	 xeno 	 phobia 	 	and	 author 	 itarianism 	 	and	puritanism	?
what	 make 	 s 	 	them	moral	?
the	answer	,	i	think	,	is	 contain 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	 trip 	 ty 	 ch 	 	from	hieronymus	bosch	,	``	the	garden	of	 earth 	 ly 	 	delights	.	``
in	the	first	 pan 	 el 	 	,	we	see	the	moment	of	creation	.
all	is	 order 	 ed 	 	,	all	is	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	all	the	people	and	 animal 	 s 	 	are	 do 	 ing 	 	what	they	're	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	 do 	 ing 	 	,	where	they	're	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	.
but	then	,	 give 	 n 	 	the	way	of	the	world	,	 thing 	 s 	 	change	.
we	get	every	person	 do 	 ing 	 	 what 	 ever 	 	he	 want 	 s 	 	,	with	every	aperture	of	every	other	person	and	every	other	animal	.
some	of	you	might	 recogn 	 ize 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	'60s	.
but	the	'60s	 inevit 	 ably 	 	 give 	 s 	 	way	to	the	'70s	,	where	the	 cutting 	 s 	 	of	the	 aperture 	 s 	 	hurt	a	little	bit	more	.
of	course	,	bosch	 call 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	hell	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 trip 	 ty 	 ch 	 	,	these	three	 pan 	 el 	 s 	 	 port 	 ray 	 	the	 time 	 less 	 	truth	that	order	 tend 	 s 	 	to	decay	.
the	truth	of	social	 ent 	 ropy 	 	.
but	 l 	 est 	 	you	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	some	part	of	the	christian	 imagin 	 ation 	 	where	christians	have	 th 	 is 	 	weird	problem	with	pleasure	,	here	's	the	same	story	,	the	same	 progress 	 ion 	 	,	told	in	a	paper	that	was	 publish 	 ed 	 	in	nature	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	in	which	ernst	fehr	and	simon	gachter	had	people	play	a	 common 	 s 	 	dilemma	.
a	game	in	which	you	give	people	money	,	and	then	,	on	each	round	of	the	game	,	they	can	put	money	 in 	 to 	 	a	common	pot	,	and	then	the	 experiment 	 er 	 	 double 	 s 	 	what	's	in	there	,	and	then	it	's	all	 divid 	 ed 	 	among	the	 player 	 s 	 	.
so	it	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	nice	analog	for	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 environment 	 al 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	,	where	we	're	 ask 	 ing 	 	people	to	make	a	sacrifice	and	they	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	benefit	from	 the 	 ir 	 	own	sacrifice	.
but	you	 re 	 ally 	 	want	 every 	 body 	 	else	to	sacrifice	,	but	 every 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 tempt 	 ation 	 	to	a	free	ride	.
and	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	that	,	at	first	,	people	start	off	 reason 	 ably 	 	 co 	 operative 	 	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	 play 	 ed 	 	 anonym 	 ously 	 	.	on	the	first	round	,	people	give	about	half	of	the	money	that	they	can	.
but	they	 quick 	 ly 	 	see	,	``	you	know	what	,	other	people	are	n't	 do 	 ing 	 	so	much	 th 	 ough 	 	.
i	do	n't	want	to	be	a	 suck 	 er 	 	.	i	'm	not	going	to	cooperate	.	``
and	so	 co 	 operation 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	 decay 	 s 	 	from	 reason 	 ably 	 	good	,	down	to	close	to	zero	.
but	then	--	and	here	's	the	trick	--	fehr	and	gachter	 s 	 aid 	 	,	on	the	 seven 	 th 	 	round	,	they	told	people	,	``	you	know	what	?	new	rule	.
if	you	want	to	give	some	of	your	own	money	to	punish	people	who	are	n't	 con 	 trib 	 uting 	 	,	you	can	do	that	.	``
and	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	people	heard	about	the	 punish 	 ment 	 	issue	going	on	,	 co 	 operation 	 	 shoot 	 s 	 	up	.
it	 shoot 	 s 	 	up	and	it	 keep 	 s 	 	going	up	.
there	's	a	lot	of	research	 show 	 ing 	 	that	to	solve	 co 	 operative 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	,	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 help 	 s 	 	.
it	's	not	 en 	 ough 	 	to	just	appeal	to	people	's	good	 motive 	 s 	 	.	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 help 	 s 	 	to	have	some	sort	of	 punish 	 ment 	 	.
even	if	it	's	just	shame	or	 embarrass 	 ment 	 	or	gossip	,	you	need	some	sort	of	 punish 	 ment 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	people	,	when	they	're	in	large	 group 	 s 	 	,	to	cooperate	.
there	's	even	some	 re 	 cent 	 	research	 suggest 	 ing 	 	that	 relig 	 ion 	 	--	 prim 	 ing 	 	god	,	making	people	think	about	god	--	often	,	in	some	 situ 	 ations 	 	,	 lead 	 s 	 	to	more	 co 	 operative 	 	,	more	pro	-	social	behavior	.
some	people	think	that	 relig 	 ion 	 	is	an	 adapt 	 ation 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	both	by	cultural	and	 bio 	 logical 	 	evolution	to	make	 group 	 s 	 	to	cohere	,	in	part	for	the	purpose	of	 trust 	 ing 	 	each	other	,	and	then	 be 	 ing 	 	more	effective	at	 com 	 pet 	 ing 	 	with	other	 group 	 s 	 	.
i	think	that	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	right	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	controversial	issue	.
but	i	'm	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	and	the	origin	of	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	and	in	what	it	 do 	 es 	 	to	us	and	for	us	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	think	that	the	 great 	 est 	 	wonder	in	the	world	is	not	the	grand	canyon	.
the	grand	canyon	is	 re 	 ally 	 	simple	.
it	's	just	a	lot	of	rock	,	and	then	a	lot	of	water	and	wind	,	and	a	lot	of	time	,	and	you	get	the	grand	canyon	.
it	's	not	that	 complic 	 ated 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	,	that	there	 we 	 re 	 	people	living	in	 place 	 s 	 	like	the	grand	canyon	,	 co 	 oper 	 ating 	 	with	each	other	,	or	on	the	 savanna 	 h 	 s 	 	of	africa	,	or	on	the	 froze 	 n 	 	 shore 	 s 	 	of	alaska	,	and	then	some	of	these	 village 	 s 	 	grew	 in 	 to 	 	the	 might 	 y 	 	cities	of	babylon	,	and	rome	,	and	tenochtitlan	.
how	did	 th 	 is 	 	happen	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	absolute	miracle	,	much	 hard 	 er 	 	to	explain	than	the	grand	canyon	.
the	answer	,	i	think	,	is	that	they	used	every	tool	in	the	 tool 	 box 	 	.
it	took	all	of	our	moral	 psycho 	 logy 	 	to	create	these	 co 	 operative 	 	 group 	 s 	 	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	you	do	need	to	be	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	harm	,	you	do	need	a	 psycho 	 logy 	 	of	justice	.
but	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 help 	 s 	 	to	organize	a	group	if	you	can	have	sub	-	 group 	 s 	 	,	and	if	 t 	 hose 	 	sub	-	 group 	 s 	 	have	some	internal	structure	,	and	if	you	have	some	 ideo 	 logy 	 	that	 tell 	 s 	 	people	to	suppress	 the 	 ir 	 	 car 	 n 	 ality 	 	,	to	pursue	 high 	 er 	 	,	 noble 	 r 	 	 end 	 s 	 	.
and	now	we	get	to	the	crux	of	the	 disagree 	 ment 	 	between	 liberal 	 s 	 	and	 conserv 	 ative 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 liberal 	 s 	 	reject	three	of	these	 found 	 ations 	 	.
they	say	``	no	,	let	's	 celebr 	 ate 	 	 divers 	 ity 	 	,	not	common	in	-	group	 member 	 ship 	 	.	``
they	say	,	``	let	's	question	 author 	 ity 	 	.	``
and	they	say	,	``	keep	your	 law 	 s 	 	off	my	body	.	``
 liberal 	 s 	 	have	 ver 	 y 	 	noble	 motive 	 s 	 	for	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
 tradition 	 al 	 	 author 	 ity 	 	,	 tradition 	 al 	 	 moral 	 ity 	 	can	be	 quit 	 e 	 	 repress 	 ive 	 	,	and	 restrict 	 ive 	 	to	 t 	 hose 	 	at	the	bottom	,	to	women	,	to	people	that	do	n't	fit	in	.
so	 liberal 	 s 	 	speak	for	the	weak	and	 oppress 	 ed 	 	.
they	want	change	and	justice	,	even	at	the	risk	of	 cha 	 os 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	guy	's	shirt	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	stop	 bitch 	 ing 	 	,	start	a	revolution	.	``
if	you	're	high	in	 open 	 ness 	 	to	experience	,	revolution	is	good	,	it	's	change	,	it	's	 f 	 un 	 	.
 conserv 	 ative 	 s 	 	,	on	the	other	hand	,	speak	for	 institution 	 s 	 	and	 tradition 	 s 	 	.
they	want	order	,	even	at	some	cost	to	 t 	 hose 	 	at	the	bottom	.
the	great	 conserv 	 ative 	 	 in 	 sight 	 	is	that	order	is	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	precious	,	and	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	easy	to	lose	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	edmund	burke	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	the	 restraint 	 s 	 	on	men	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 liber 	 ties 	 	,	are	to	be	 reckon 	 ed 	 	among	 the 	 ir 	 	 right 	 s 	 	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	was	after	the	 cha 	 os 	 	of	the	french	revolution	.
so	once	you	see	 th 	 is 	 	--	once	you	see	that	 liberal 	 s 	 	and	 conserv 	 ative 	 s 	 	both	have	 some 	 thing 	 	to	 con 	 tribute 	 	,	that	they	form	a	balance	on	change	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	 st 	 ability 	 	--	then	i	think	the	way	is	open	to	step	 out 	 side 	 	the	moral	 m 	 atrix 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	great	 in 	 sight 	 	that	all	the	asian	 relig 	 ions 	 	have	 attain 	 ed 	 	.
think	about	 y 	 in 	 	and	 y 	 ang 	 	.
 y 	 in 	 	and	 y 	 ang 	 	are	n't	 ene 	 mies 	 	.	 y 	 in 	 	and	 y 	 ang 	 	do	n't	hate	each	other	.
 y 	 in 	 	and	 y 	 ang 	 	are	both	 necess 	 ary 	 	,	like	night	and	day	,	for	the	 function 	 ing 	 	of	the	world	.
you	find	the	same	thing	in	hinduism	.
there	are	 man 	 y 	 	high	 god 	 s 	 	in	hinduism	.
two	of	them	are	vishnu	,	the	 preserve 	 r 	 	,	and	shiva	,	the	 destroy 	 er 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	image	 actual 	 ly 	 	is	both	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 god 	 s 	 	sharing	the	same	body	.
you	have	the	 mark 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	vishnu	on	the	left	,	so	we	could	think	of	vishnu	 a 	 s 	 	the	 conserv 	 ative 	 	god	.
you	have	the	 mark 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	shiva	on	the	right	,	shiva	's	the	liberal	god	.	and	they	work	together	.
you	find	the	same	thing	in	buddhism	.
these	two	 stanza 	 s 	 	contain	,	i	think	,	the	 deep 	 est 	 	 in 	 sight 	 s 	 	that	have	ever	 be 	 en 	 	 attain 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	moral	 psycho 	 logy 	 	.
from	the	zen	master	seng	-	ts'an	:	``	if	you	want	the	truth	to	stand	clear	before	you	,	never	be	for	or	against	.	the	struggle	between	for	and	against	is	the	mind	's	worst	disease	.	``
now	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	a	disease	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	caught	by	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	world	's	 lead 	 ers 	 	.
but	before	you	feel	 super 	 ior 	 	to	george	bush	,	before	you	throw	a	stone	,	ask	 your 	 self 	 	,	do	you	accept	 th 	 is 	 	?
do	you	accept	 step 	 ping 	 	out	of	the	battle	of	good	and	 e 	 vil 	 	?
can	you	be	not	for	or	against	 any 	 thing 	 	?
so	,	what	's	the	point	?	what	should	you	do	?
well	,	if	you	take	the	 great 	 est 	 	 in 	 sight 	 s 	 	from	ancient	asian	 philosoph 	 ies 	 	and	 relig 	 ions 	 	,	and	you	combine	them	with	the	 lat 	 est 	 	research	on	moral	 psycho 	 logy 	 	,	i	think	you	come	to	these	 con 	 clusion 	 s 	 	:	that	our	righteous	 mind 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	designed	by	evolution	to	 un 	 ite 	 	us	 in 	 to 	 	 team 	 s 	 	,	to	divide	us	against	other	 team 	 s 	 	and	then	to	blind	us	to	the	truth	.
so	what	should	you	do	?	am	i	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	to	not	 striv 	 e 	 	?
am	i	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	to	embrace	seng	-	ts'an	and	stop	,	stop	with	 th 	 is 	 	struggle	of	for	and	against	?
no	,	 absolute 	 ly 	 	not	.	i	'm	not	 say 	 ing 	 	that	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	group	of	people	who	are	 do 	 ing 	 	so	much	,	using	so	much	of	 the 	 ir 	 	talent	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 brilli 	 ance 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	energy	,	 the 	 ir 	 	money	,	to	make	the	world	a	better	place	,	to	fight	--	to	fight	 wrong 	 s 	 	,	to	solve	 problem 	 s 	 	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	samantha	power	,	in	her	story	about	sergio	vieira	de	mello	,	you	ca	n't	just	go	charging	in	,	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	you	're	wrong	,	and	i	'm	right	.	``
 be 	 cause 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	just	heard	,	 every 	 body 	 	 think 	 s 	 	they	are	right	.
a	lot	of	the	 problem 	 s 	 	we	have	to	solve	are	 problem 	 s 	 	that	 requir 	 e 	 	us	to	change	other	people	.
and	if	you	want	to	change	other	people	,	a	much	better	way	to	do	it	is	to	first	understand	who	we	are	--	understand	our	moral	 psycho 	 logy 	 	,	understand	that	we	all	think	we	're	right	--	and	then	step	out	,	even	if	it	's	just	for	a	moment	,	step	out	--	check	in	with	seng	-	ts'an	.
step	out	of	the	moral	 m 	 atrix 	 	,	just	try	to	see	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	struggle	 play 	 ing 	 	out	,	in	which	 every 	 body 	 	 do 	 es 	 	think	they	're	right	,	and	 every 	 body 	 	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	some	 reason 	 s 	 	--	even	if	you	disagree	with	them	--	 every 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	some	 reason 	 s 	 	for	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	.
step	out	.
and	if	you	do	that	,	that	's	the	essential	move	to	 cultiv 	 ate 	 	moral	 humil 	 ity 	 	,	to	get	 your 	 self 	 	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	self	-	 righteous 	 ness 	 	,	which	is	the	normal	human	condition	.
think	about	the	dalai	lama	.
think	about	the	enormous	moral	 author 	 ity 	 	of	the	dalai	lama	--	and	it	 come 	 s 	 	from	his	moral	 humil 	 ity 	 	.
so	i	think	the	point	--	the	point	of	my	talk	,	and	i	think	the	point	of	ted	--	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	group	that	is	 passionate 	 ly 	 	 engag 	 ed 	 	in	the	 pur 	 suit 	 	of	changing	the	world	for	the	better	.
people	here	are	 passionate 	 ly 	 	 engag 	 ed 	 	in	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	the	world	a	better	place	.
but	there	is	 al 	 so 	 	a	passionate	 commit 	 ment 	 	to	the	truth	.
and	so	i	think	that	the	answer	is	to	use	that	passionate	 commit 	 ment 	 	to	the	truth	to	try	to	turn	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	better	future	for	us	all	.
thank	you	.
