do	you	know	how	 man 	 y 	 	 choice 	 s 	 	you	make	in	typical	week	?
i	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	did	a	survey	with	over	2,000	americans	,	and	the	average	number	of	 choice 	 s 	 	that	the	typical	american	 report 	 s 	 	making	is	about	70	in	a	typical	day	.
there	was	 al 	 so 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	a	 stud 	 y 	 	 d 	 one 	 	with	ceos	in	which	they	 follow 	 ed 	 	ceos	around	for	a	whole	week	.
and	these	 scientist 	 s 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	 document 	 ed 	 	all	the	 vari 	 ous 	 	 task 	 s 	 	that	these	ceos	 engag 	 ed 	 	in	and	how	much	time	they	 s 	 pent 	 	 engag 	 ing 	 	in	making	 decision 	 s 	 	related	to	these	 task 	 s 	 	.
and	they	found	that	the	average	ceo	 engag 	 ed 	 	in	about	139	 task 	 s 	 	in	a	week	.
each	task	was	made	up	of	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	sub	-	 choice 	 s 	 	of	course	.
50	percent	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 decision 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	made	in	nine	 minute 	 s 	 	or	less	.
 on 	 ly 	 	about	12	percent	of	the	 decision 	 s 	 	did	they	make	an	hour	or	more	of	 the 	 ir 	 	time	.
think	about	your	own	 choice 	 s 	 	.
do	you	know	how	 man 	 y 	 	 choice 	 s 	 	make	it	 in 	 to 	 	your	nine	minute	 categor 	 y 	 	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	your	one	hour	 categor 	 y 	 	?
how	well	do	you	think	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	at	 man 	 aging 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 choice 	 s 	 	?
 to 	 day 	 	i	want	to	talk	about	one	of	the	 big 	 gest 	 	modern	day	 choos 	 ing 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	that	we	have	,	which	is	the	choice	 over 	 load 	 	problem	.
i	want	to	talk	about	the	problem	and	some	potential	 solution 	 s 	 	.
now	 a 	 s 	 	i	talk	about	 th 	 is 	 	problem	,	i	'm	going	to	have	some	 question 	 s 	 	for	you	and	i	'm	going	to	want	to	know	your	 answer 	 s 	 	.
so	when	i	ask	you	a	question	,	since	i	'm	blind	,	 on 	 ly 	 	raise	your	hand	if	you	want	to	burn	off	some	 calorie 	 s 	 	.
 other 	 wise 	 	,	when	i	ask	you	a	question	,	and	if	your	answer	is	 y 	 es 	 	,	i	'd	like	you	to	clap	your	 hand 	 s 	 	.
so	for	my	first	question	for	you	 to 	 day 	 	:	are	you	 guy 	 s 	 	ready	to	hear	about	the	choice	 over 	 load 	 	problem	?
thank	you	.
so	when	i	was	a	graduate	student	at	stanford	university	,	i	used	to	go	to	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 up 	 scale 	 	 grocer 	 y 	 	store	;	at	 l 	 east 	 	at	that	time	it	was	 tru 	 ly 	 	 up 	 scale 	 	.
it	was	a	store	 call 	 ed 	 	_UNK_	's	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	store	,	it	was	 al 	 most 	 	like	going	to	an	 amuse 	 ment 	 	park	.
they	had	250	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 must 	 ard 	 s 	 	and	vinegars	and	over	500	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 fruit 	 s 	 	and	 veget 	 able 	 s 	 	and	more	than	two	dozen	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 bottle 	 d 	 	water	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	was	 dur 	 ing 	 	a	time	when	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	used	to	drink	tap	water	.
i	used	to	love	going	to	 th 	 is 	 	store	,	but	on	one	occasion	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	 my 	 self 	 	,	well	how	come	you	never	buy	 any 	 thing 	 	?
here	's	 the 	 ir 	 	 o 	 live 	 	oil	aisle	.
they	had	over	75	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 o 	 live 	 	oil	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	in	a	 lock 	 ed 	 	case	that	came	from	thousand	-	year	-	old	 o 	 live 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	.
so	i	one	day	 decide 	 d 	 	to	pay	a	visit	to	the	 manage 	 r 	 	,	and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	 manage 	 r 	 	,	``	is	 th 	 is 	 	model	of	 off 	 er 	 ing 	 	people	all	 th 	 is 	 	choice	 re 	 ally 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	?	``
and	he	 point 	 ed 	 	to	the	_UNK_	of	 tourist 	 s 	 	that	would	show	up	 every 	 day 	 	,	with	 camera 	 s 	 	ready	 usual 	 ly 	 	.
we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	do	a	little	experiment	,	and	we	 pick 	 ed 	 	jam	for	our	experiment	.
here	's	 the 	 ir 	 	jam	aisle	.
they	had	348	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	jam	.
we	set	up	a	little	tasting	booth	right	near	the	 en 	 trance 	 	of	the	store	.
we	there	put	out	six	different	 flavor 	 s 	 	of	jam	or	24	different	 flavor 	 s 	 	of	jam	,	and	we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	two	 thing 	 s 	 	:	first	,	in	which	case	 we 	 re 	 	people	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	stop	,	 s 	 ample 	 	some	jam	?
more	people	 stop 	 ped 	 	when	there	 we 	 re 	 	24	,	about	60	percent	,	than	when	there	 we 	 re 	 	six	,	about	40	percent	.
the	next	thing	we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	is	in	which	case	 we 	 re 	 	people	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	buy	a	jar	of	jam	.
now	we	see	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	effect	.
of	the	people	who	 stop 	 ped 	 	when	there	 we 	 re 	 	24	,	 on 	 ly 	 	three	percent	of	them	 actual 	 ly 	 	 b 	 ought 	 	a	jar	of	jam	.
of	the	people	who	 stop 	 ped 	 	when	there	 we 	 re 	 	six	,	well	now	we	saw	that	30	percent	of	them	 actual 	 ly 	 	 b 	 ought 	 	a	jar	of	jam	.
now	if	you	do	the	math	,	people	 we 	 re 	 	at	 l 	 east 	 	six	 time 	 s 	 	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	buy	a	jar	of	jam	if	they	 en 	 counter 	 ed 	 	six	than	if	they	 en 	 counter 	 ed 	 	24	.
now	 choos 	 ing 	 	not	to	buy	a	jar	of	jam	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	good	for	us	--	at	 l 	 east 	 	it	's	good	for	our	 waist 	 lines 	 	--	but	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	 th 	 is 	 	choice	 over 	 load 	 	problem	 affect 	 s 	 	us	even	in	 ver 	 y 	 	 con 	 sequent 	 ial 	 	 decision 	 s 	 	.
we	 choos 	 e 	 	not	to	 choos 	 e 	 	,	even	when	it	 go 	 es 	 	against	our	best	self	-	 interest 	 s 	 	.
so	now	for	the	 top 	 ic 	 	of	 to 	 day 	 	:	financial	 saving 	 s 	 	.
now	i	'm	going	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	to	you	a	 stud 	 y 	 	i	did	with	_UNK_	_UNK_	,	_UNK_	_UNK_	,	wei	_UNK_	where	we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	 retire 	 ment 	 	 saving 	 s 	 	 decision 	 s 	 	of	 near 	 ly 	 	a	million	americans	from	about	650	 plan 	 s 	 	all	in	the	u.s	.
and	what	we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	was	 whet 	 her 	 	the	number	of	fund	 off 	 er 	 ing 	 s 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	in	a	 retire 	 ment 	 	 saving 	 s 	 	plan	,	the	401	plan	,	 do 	 es 	 	that	affect	people	's	 like 	 li 	 hood 	 	to	 s 	 ave 	 	more	for	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	.
and	what	we	found	was	that	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	there	was	a	correlation	.
so	in	these	 plan 	 s 	 	,	we	had	about	657	 plan 	 s 	 	that	 rang 	 ed 	 	from	 off 	 er 	 ing 	 	people	 any 	 where 	 	from	two	to	59	different	fund	 off 	 er 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
and	what	we	found	was	that	,	the	more	 fund 	 s 	 	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	,	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	there	was	less	 particip 	 ation 	 	rate	.
so	if	you	look	at	the	 extrem 	 es 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 plan 	 s 	 	that	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	you	two	 fund 	 s 	 	,	 particip 	 ation 	 	rates	 we 	 re 	 	around	in	the	mid	-	70s	--	still	not	 a 	 s 	 	high	 a 	 s 	 	we	want	it	to	be	.
in	 t 	 hose 	 	 plan 	 s 	 	that	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	 near 	 ly 	 	60	 fund 	 s 	 	,	 particip 	 ation 	 	rates	have	now	 drop 	 ped 	 	to	about	the	60th	 percent 	 ile 	 	.
now	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	even	if	you	do	 choos 	 e 	 	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	when	there	are	more	 choice 	 s 	 	present	,	even	then	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	negative	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	.
so	for	 t 	 hose 	 	people	who	did	 choos 	 e 	 	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	,	the	more	 choice 	 s 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	,	the	more	 like 	 ly 	 	people	 we 	 re 	 	to	 complete 	 ly 	 	avoid	 stock 	 s 	 	or	 equ 	 ity 	 	 fund 	 s 	 	.
the	more	 choice 	 s 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	,	the	more	 like 	 ly 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	to	put	all	 the 	 ir 	 	money	in	 pur 	 e 	 	money	market	 account 	 s 	 	.
now	 n 	 either 	 	of	these	 extrem 	 e 	 	 decision 	 s 	 	are	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 decision 	 s 	 	that	any	of	us	would	recommend	for	people	when	you	're	 consider 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	future	financial	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	.
well	,	over	the	past	decade	,	we	have	 observ 	 ed 	 	three	main	negative	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	to	 off 	 er 	 ing 	 	people	more	and	more	 choice 	 s 	 	.
they	're	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	delay	 choos 	 ing 	 	--	_UNK_	even	when	it	 go 	 es 	 	against	 the 	 ir 	 	best	self	-	interest	.
they	're	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	make	 wo 	 rse 	 	 choice 	 s 	 	--	 wo 	 rse 	 	financial	 choice 	 s 	 	,	medical	 choice 	 s 	 	.
they	're	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	 choos 	 e 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	make	them	less	satisfied	,	even	when	they	do	 object 	 ively 	 	better	.
the	main	reason	for	 th 	 is 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	,	we	might	enjoy	 gaz 	 ing 	 	at	 t 	 hose 	 	giant	 wall 	 s 	 	of	_UNK_	,	 must 	 ard 	 s 	 	,	vinegars	,	 jam 	 s 	 	,	but	we	ca	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	the	math	of	 compar 	 ing 	 	and	_UNK_	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	 pick 	 ing 	 	from	that	 stunn 	 ing 	 	 dis 	 play 	 	.
so	what	i	want	to	 pro 	 pose 	 	to	you	 to 	 day 	 	are	four	simple	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	--	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	that	we	have	tested	in	one	way	or	 an 	 other 	 	in	different	research	 venue 	 s 	 	--	that	you	can	 eas 	 ily 	 	 app 	 ly 	 	in	your	 business 	 es 	 	.
the	first	:	cut	.
you	've	heard	it	 s 	 aid 	 	before	,	but	it	's	never	 be 	 en 	 	more	true	than	 to 	 day 	 	,	that	less	is	more	.
people	are	 al 	 ways 	 	 up 	 set 	 	when	i	say	,	``	cut	.	``
they	're	 al 	 ways 	 	 worri 	 ed 	 	they	're	going	to	lose	shelf	space	.
but	in	fact	,	what	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	more	and	more	is	that	if	you	are	 will 	 ing 	 	to	cut	,	get	rid	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 extra 	 ne 	 ous 	 	 red 	 un 	 d 	 ant 	 	 option 	 s 	 	,	well	there	's	an	 in 	 crease 	 	in	 sale 	 s 	 	,	there	's	a	 lower 	 ing 	 	of	 cost 	 s 	 	,	there	is	an	 improve 	 ment 	 	of	the	 choos 	 ing 	 	experience	.
when	proctor	&	gamble	went	from	26	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	head	&	 shoulder 	 s 	 	to	15	,	they	saw	an	 in 	 crease 	 	in	 sale 	 s 	 	by	10	percent	.
when	the	 gold 	 en 	 	cat	corporation	got	rid	of	 the 	 ir 	 	10	worst	-	selling	cat	litter	 product 	 s 	 	,	they	saw	an	 in 	 crease 	 	in	 profit 	 s 	 	by	87	percent	--	a	function	of	both	 in 	 crease 	 	in	 sale 	 s 	 	and	 lower 	 ing 	 	of	 cost 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	the	average	 grocer 	 y 	 	store	 to 	 day 	 	 off 	 ers 	 	you	45,000	 product 	 s 	 	.
the	typical	walmart	 to 	 day 	 	 off 	 ers 	 	you	100,000	 product 	 s 	 	.
but	the	 n 	 in 	 th 	 	largest	 re 	 tail 	 er 	 	,	the	 n 	 in 	 th 	 	 big 	 gest 	 	 re 	 tail 	 er 	 	in	the	world	 to 	 day 	 	is	_UNK_	,	and	it	 off 	 ers 	 	you	 on 	 ly 	 	1,400	 product 	 s 	 	--	one	kind	of	 can 	 ned 	 	tomato	sauce	.
now	in	the	financial	 saving 	 s 	 	world	,	i	think	one	of	the	best	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	come	out	on	how	to	best	manage	the	choice	 off 	 er 	 ing 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	david	_UNK_	was	 heav 	 ily 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 design 	 ing 	 	,	which	was	the	program	that	they	have	at	harvard	.
every	single	harvard	 employ 	 ee 	 	is	now	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	 enroll 	 ed 	 	in	a	 life 	 cycle 	 	fund	.
for	 t 	 hose 	 	people	who	 actual 	 ly 	 	want	to	 choos 	 e 	 	,	they	're	 give 	 n 	 	20	 fund 	 s 	 	,	not	300	or	more	 fund 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	often	,	people	say	,	``	i	do	n't	know	how	to	cut	.
they	're	all	 import 	 ant 	 	 choice 	 s 	 	.	``
and	the	first	thing	i	do	is	i	ask	the	 employ 	 ees 	 	,	``	tell	me	how	these	 choice 	 s 	 	are	different	from	one	 an 	 other 	 	.
and	if	your	 employ 	 ees 	 	ca	n't	tell	them	 a 	 part 	 	,	 n 	 either 	 	can	your	 consumer 	 s 	 	.	``
now	before	we	 start 	 ed 	 	our	session	 th 	 is 	 	afternoon	,	i	had	a	chat	with	gary	.
and	gary	 s 	 aid 	 	that	he	would	be	 will 	 ing 	 	to	 off 	 er 	 	people	in	 th 	 is 	 	audience	an	all	-	 expense 	 s 	 	-	paid	free	 vac 	 ation 	 	to	the	most	 beaut 	 iful 	 	road	in	the	world	.
here	's	a	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	of	the	road	.
and	i	'd	like	you	to	read	it	.
and	now	i	'll	give	you	a	few	 second 	 s 	 	to	read	it
and	then	i	want	you	to	clap	your	 hand 	 s 	 	if	you	're	ready	to	take	gary	up	on	his	 off 	 er 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	 any 	 body 	 	who	's	ready	to	take	him	up	on	his	 off 	 er 	 	.
is	that	all	?
all	right	,	let	me	show	you	some	more	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
you	 guy 	 s 	 	 k 	 new 	 	there	was	a	trick	,	did	n't	you	.
now	who	's	ready	to	go	on	 th 	 is 	 	trip	.
i	think	i	might	have	 actual 	 ly 	 	heard	more	 hand 	 s 	 	.
all	right	.
now	in	fact	,	you	had	 object 	 ively 	 	more	information	the	first	time	around	than	the	second	time	around	,	but	i	would	venture	to	guess	that	you	felt	that	it	was	more	real	the	second	time	around	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	 picture 	 s 	 	made	it	feel	more	real	to	you	.
which	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	me	to	the	second	 techni 	 que 	 	for	 hand 	 ling 	 	the	choice	 over 	 load 	 	problem	,	which	is	_UNK_	.
that	in	order	for	people	to	understand	the	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	between	the	 choice 	 s 	 	,	they	have	to	be	able	to	understand	the	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	 associate 	 d 	 	with	each	choice	,	and	that	the	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	need	to	be	felt	in	a	 vivi 	 d 	 	sort	of	way	,	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	way	.
why	do	people	 s 	 pend 	 	an	average	of	15	to	30	percent	more	when	they	use	an	atm	card	or	a	credit	card	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	cash	?
 be 	 cause 	 	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	feel	like	real	money	.
and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	making	it	feel	more	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	a	 ver 	 y 	 	positive	tool	to	use	in	 get 	 ting 	 	people	to	 s 	 ave 	 	more	.
so	a	 stud 	 y 	 	that	i	did	with	shlomo	benartzi	and	alessandro	_UNK_	,	we	did	a	 stud 	 y 	 	with	people	at	ing	--	 employ 	 ees 	 	that	are	all	 work 	 ing 	 	at	ing	--	and	now	these	people	 we 	 re 	 	all	in	a	session	where	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	 enroll 	 ment 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	401	plan	.
and	 dur 	 ing 	 	that	session	,	we	 ke 	 pt 	 	the	session	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	way	it	used	to	be	,	but	we	 add 	 ed 	 	one	little	thing	.
the	one	little	thing	we	 add 	 ed 	 	was	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	people	to	just	think	about	all	the	positive	 thing 	 s 	 	that	would	happen	in	your	life	if	you	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	more	.
by	 do 	 ing 	 	that	simple	thing	,	there	was	an	 in 	 crease 	 	in	 enroll 	 ment 	 	by	20	percent	and	there	was	an	 in 	 crease 	 	in	the	amount	of	people	 will 	 ing 	 	to	 s 	 ave 	 	or	the	amount	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	 will 	 ing 	 	to	put	down	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 saving 	 s 	 	account	by	four	percent	.
the	third	 techni 	 que 	 	:	 categor 	 ization 	 	.
we	can	handle	more	 categor 	 ies 	 	than	we	can	handle	 choice 	 s 	 	.
so	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	here	's	a	 stud 	 y 	 	we	did	in	a	magazine	aisle	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	in	_UNK_	 grocer 	 y 	 	 store 	 s 	 	up	and	down	the	 north 	 east 	 	corridor	,	the	magazine	 aisle 	 s 	 	range	 any 	 where 	 	from	331	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 magazine 	 s 	 	all	the	way	up	to	664	.
but	you	know	what	?
if	i	show	you	600	 magazine 	 s 	 	and	i	divide	them	up	 in 	 to 	 	10	 categor 	 ies 	 	,	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	i	show	you	400	 magazine 	 s 	 	and	divide	them	up	 in 	 to 	 	20	 categor 	 ies 	 	,	you	 believ 	 e 	 	that	i	have	 give 	 n 	 	you	more	choice	and	a	better	 choos 	 ing 	 	experience	if	i	 g 	 ave 	 	you	the	400	than	if	i	 g 	 ave 	 	you	the	600	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	 categor 	 ies 	 	tell	me	how	to	tell	them	 a 	 part 	 	.
here	are	two	different	 jewel 	 ry 	 	 dis 	 play 	 s 	 	.
one	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	jazz	``	and	the	other	one	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 s 	 wing 	 	.	``
if	you	think	the	 dis 	 play 	 	on	the	left	is	 s 	 wing 	 	and	the	 dis 	 play 	 	on	the	right	is	jazz	,	clap	your	 hand 	 s 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	there	's	some	.
if	you	think	the	one	on	the	left	is	jazz	and	the	one	on	the	right	is	 s 	 wing 	 	,	clap	your	 hand 	 s 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	a	bit	more	.
now	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	you	're	right	.
the	one	on	the	left	is	jazz	and	the	one	on	the	right	is	 s 	 wing 	 	,	but	you	know	what	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 high 	 ly 	 	 use 	 less 	 	 categor 	 ization 	 	scheme	.
the	 categor 	 ies 	 	need	to	say	 some 	 thing 	 	to	the	_UNK_	,	not	the	choice	-	maker	.
and	you	often	see	that	problem	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	down	to	 t 	 hose 	 	long	 list 	 s 	 	of	all	these	 fund 	 s 	 	.
who	are	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	 inform 	 ing 	 	?
my	fourth	 techni 	 que 	 	:	condition	for	 complex 	 ity 	 	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	handle	a	lot	more	information	than	we	think	we	can	,	we	've	just	got	to	take	it	a	little	 eas 	 ier 	 	.
we	have	to	 gradu 	 ally 	 	 in 	 crease 	 	the	 complex 	 ity 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	show	you	one	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	what	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	.
let	's	take	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	decision	:	 buy 	 ing 	 	a	car	.
here	's	a	german	car	 manufactur 	 er 	 	that	 give 	 s 	 	you	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	 complete 	 ly 	 	custom	make	your	car	.
you	've	got	to	make	60	different	 decision 	 s 	 	,	 complete 	 ly 	 	make	up	your	car	.
now	these	 decision 	 s 	 	vary	in	the	number	of	 choice 	 s 	 	that	they	 off 	 er 	 	per	decision	.
car	 color 	 s 	 	,	 ex 	 terior 	 	car	 color 	 s 	 	--	i	've	got	56	 choice 	 s 	 	.
 engine 	 s 	 	,	gearshift	--	four	 choice 	 s 	 	.
so	now	what	i	'm	going	to	do	is	i	'm	going	to	vary	the	order	in	which	these	 decision 	 s 	 	appear	.
so	half	of	the	 custom 	 ers 	 	are	going	to	go	from	high	choice	,	56	car	 color 	 s 	 	,	to	low	choice	,	four	gearshifts	.
the	other	half	of	the	 custom 	 ers 	 	are	going	to	go	from	low	choice	,	four	gearshifts	,	to	56	car	 color 	 s 	 	,	high	choice	.
what	am	i	going	to	look	at	?
how	 engag 	 ed 	 	you	are	.
if	you	keep	hitting	the	default	button	per	decision	,	that	 mean 	 s 	 	you	're	 get 	 ting 	 	 overwhelm 	 ed 	 	,	that	 mean 	 s 	 	i	'm	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	you	.
what	you	find	is	the	people	who	go	from	high	choice	to	low	choice	,	they	're	hitting	that	default	button	over	and	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	.
we	're	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	them	.
they	go	from	low	choice	to	high	choice	,	they	're	 hang 	 ing 	 	in	there	.
it	's	the	same	information	.	it	's	the	same	number	of	 choice 	 s 	 	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	that	i	have	 d 	 one 	 	is	i	have	 vari 	 ed 	 	the	order	in	which	that	information	is	 present 	 ed 	 	.
if	i	start	you	off	easy	,	i	learn	how	to	 choos 	 e 	 	.
even	 th 	 ough 	 	 choos 	 ing 	 	gearshift	 do 	 es 	 	n't	tell	me	 any 	 thing 	 	about	my	 pre 	 ference 	 s 	 	for	 in 	 terior 	 	decor	,	it	still	_UNK_	me	for	how	to	 choos 	 e 	 	.
it	 al 	 so 	 	 get 	 s 	 	me	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	big	product	that	i	'm	 put 	 ting 	 	together	,	so	i	'm	more	 will 	 ing 	 	to	be	 motiv 	 ated 	 	to	be	 engag 	 ed 	 	.
so	let	me	 re 	 cap 	 	.
i	have	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	four	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	for	 mitig 	 ating 	 	the	problem	of	choice	 over 	 load 	 	--	cut	--	get	rid	of	the	 extra 	 ne 	 ous 	 	 alter 	 native 	 s 	 	;	_UNK_	--	make	it	real	;	 categor 	 ize 	 	--	we	can	handle	more	 categor 	 ies 	 	,	less	 choice 	 s 	 	;	condition	for	 complex 	 ity 	 	.
all	of	these	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	that	i	'm	 de 	 s 	 crib 	 ing 	 	to	you	 to 	 day 	 	are	designed	to	help	you	manage	your	 choice 	 s 	 	--	better	for	you	,	you	can	use	them	on	 your 	 self 	 	,	better	for	the	people	that	you	are	 serv 	 ing 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	the	key	to	 get 	 ting 	 	the	most	from	choice	is	to	be	choosy	about	 choos 	 ing 	 	.
and	the	more	we	're	able	to	be	choosy	about	 choos 	 ing 	 	the	better	we	will	be	able	to	practice	the	art	of	 choos 	 ing 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
