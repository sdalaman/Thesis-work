back	in	new	york	,	i	am	the	head	of	 develop 	 ment 	 	for	a	non	-	profit	 call 	 ed 	 	 rob 	 in 	 	hood	.
when	i	'm	not	 fight 	 ing 	 	poverty	,	i	'm	 fight 	 ing 	 	 fire 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 assist 	 ant 	 	 cap 	 tain 	 	of	a	volunteer	fire	company	.
now	in	our	town	,	where	the	 volunteer 	 s 	 	supplement	a	 high 	 ly 	 	 skill 	 ed 	 	 care 	 er 	 	staff	,	you	have	to	get	to	the	fire	scene	 pre 	 tty 	 	early	to	get	in	on	any	action	.
i	remember	my	first	fire	.
i	was	the	second	volunteer	on	the	scene	,	so	there	was	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	chance	i	was	going	to	get	in	.
but	still	it	was	a	real	_UNK_	against	the	other	 volunteer 	 s 	 	to	get	to	the	 cap 	 tain 	 	in	charge	to	find	out	what	our	 assign 	 ments 	 	would	be	.
when	i	found	the	 cap 	 tain 	 	,	he	was	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 engag 	 ing 	 	conversation	with	the	homeowner	,	who	was	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	one	of	the	worst	 day 	 s 	 	of	her	life	.
here	it	was	,	the	middle	of	the	night	,	she	was	 stand 	 ing 	 	 out 	 side 	 	in	the	 pour 	 ing 	 	rain	,	under	an	 um 	 br 	 ella 	 	,	in	her	 pajama 	 s 	 	,	 bare 	 foot 	 	,	while	her	house	was	in	 flame 	 s 	 	.
the	other	volunteer	who	had	 arriv 	 ed 	 	just	before	me	--	let	's	call	him	lex	luther	--	got	to	the	 cap 	 tain 	 	first	and	was	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	go	 in 	 side 	 	and	 s 	 ave 	 	the	homeowner	's	dog	.
the	dog	!	i	was	 stunn 	 ed 	 	with	 jealous 	 y 	 	.
here	was	some	lawyer	or	money	 manage 	 r 	 	who	,	for	the	rest	of	his	life	,	 get 	 s 	 	to	tell	people	that	he	went	 in 	 to 	 	a	 burn 	 ing 	 	building	to	 s 	 ave 	 	a	living	creature	,	just	 be 	 cause 	 	he	beat	me	by	five	 second 	 s 	 	.
well	,	i	was	next	.
the	 cap 	 tain 	 	 wave 	 d 	 	me	over	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	bezos	,	i	need	you	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	house	.	i	need	you	to	go	 up 	 stair 	 s 	 	,	past	the	fire	,	and	i	need	you	to	get	 th 	 is 	 	woman	a	pair	of	 shoe 	 s 	 	.	``
i	 s 	 wear 	 	.
so	,	not	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	i	was	 hop 	 ing 	 	for	,	but	off	i	went	--	up	the	 stair 	 s 	 	,	down	the	hall	,	past	the	'	real	'	 fire 	 fight 	 ers 	 	,	who	 we 	 re 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 d 	 one 	 	 put 	 ting 	 	out	the	fire	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	 in 	 to 	 	the	master	 bed 	 room 	 	to	get	a	pair	of	 shoe 	 s 	 	.
now	i	know	what	you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	,	but	i	'm	no	hero	.
i	carried	my	 pay 	 load 	 	back	 down 	 stair 	 s 	 	where	i	met	my	nemesis	and	the	precious	dog	by	the	front	door	.
we	took	our	 treasu 	 re 	 s 	 	 out 	 side 	 	to	the	homeowner	,	where	,	not	 surprising 	 ly 	 	,	his	 receiv 	 ed 	 	much	more	attention	than	did	mine	.
a	few	 week 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	the	 depart 	 ment 	 	 receiv 	 ed 	 	a	letter	from	the	homeowner	 thank 	 ing 	 	us	for	the	_UNK_	effort	 dis 	 play 	 ed 	 	in	saving	her	home	.
the	act	of	 kind 	 ness 	 	she	 not 	 ed 	 	above	all	 other 	 s 	 	:	 some 	 one 	 	had	even	gotten	her	a	pair	of	 shoe 	 s 	 	.	in	both	my	 voc 	 ation 	 	at	 rob 	 in 	 	hood	and	my	_UNK_	 a 	 s 	 	a	volunteer	 fire 	 fight 	 er 	 	,	i	am	witness	to	 act 	 s 	 	of	 gene 	 ros 	 ity 	 	and	 kind 	 ness 	 	on	a	 monument 	 al 	 	scale	,	but	i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	witness	to	 act 	 s 	 	of	grace	and	courage	on	an	individual	 bas 	 is 	 	.
and	you	know	what	i	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	?
they	all	matter	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	i	look	around	 th 	 is 	 	room	at	people	who	either	have	 achiev 	 ed 	 	,	or	are	on	 the 	 ir 	 	way	to	 achiev 	 ing 	 	,	 remark 	 able 	 	 level 	 s 	 	of	success	,	i	would	 off 	 er 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 mind 	 er 	 	:	do	n't	wait	.
do	n't	wait	 un 	 til 	 	you	make	your	first	million	to	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	 some 	 body 	 	's	life	.
if	you	have	 some 	 thing 	 	to	give	,	give	it	now	.
serve	food	at	a	soup	kitchen	.	clean	up	a	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	park	.	be	a	mentor	.
not	every	day	is	going	to	 off 	 er 	 	us	a	chance	to	 s 	 ave 	 	 some 	 body 	 	's	life	,	but	every	day	 off 	 ers 	 	us	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	affect	one	.
so	get	in	the	game	.	 s 	 ave 	 	the	 shoe 	 s 	 	.
thank	you	.
