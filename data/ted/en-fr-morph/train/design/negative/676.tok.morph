i	'm	 s 	 peaking 	 	about	 compass 	 ion 	 	from	an	islamic	point	of	view	,	and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	my	faith	is	not	 ver 	 y 	 	well	thought	of	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	one	that	is	 ground 	 ed 	 	in	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
the	truth	of	the	matter	is	 other 	 wise 	 	.
our	holy	book	,	the	koran	,	 consist 	 s 	 	of	114	 chapter 	 s 	 	,	and	each	chapter	 begin 	 s 	 	with	what	we	call	the	basmala	,	the	 say 	 ing 	 	of	``	in	the	name	of	god	,	the	all	 com 	 passionate 	 	,	the	all	 merci 	 ful 	 	,	``	or	,	 a 	 s 	 	 s 	 ir 	 	richard	burton	--	not	the	richard	burton	who	was	married	to	elizabeth	taylor	,	but	the	 s 	 ir 	 	richard	burton	who	lived	a	century	before	that	and	who	was	a	 world 	 wide 	 	 travel 	 er 	 	and	 transl 	 ator 	 	of	 man 	 y 	 	 work 	 s 	 	of	 liter 	 ature 	 	--	 transl 	 ates 	 	it	.	``	in	the	name	of	god	,	the	 compass 	 ion 	 ating 	 	,	the	 com 	 passionate 	 	.	``
and	in	a	 say 	 ing 	 	of	the	koran	,	which	to	muslims	is	god	 s 	 peaking 	 	to	 human 	 ity 	 	,	god	 say 	 s 	 	to	his	prophet	muhammad	--	whom	we	 believ 	 e 	 	to	be	the	last	of	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 prophet 	 s 	 	,	 begin 	 ning 	 	with	adam	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	noah	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	moses	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	abraham	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	jesus	christ	,	and	 end 	 ing 	 	with	muhammad	--	that	,	``	we	have	not	 s 	 ent 	 	you	,	o	muhammad	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	'	rahmah	,	'	 ex 	 cept 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	source	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	to	 human 	 ity 	 	.	``
for	us	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	and	 certain 	 ly 	 	for	us	 a 	 s 	 	muslims	,	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	mission	,	and	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	purpose	in	 follow 	 ing 	 	the	path	of	the	prophet	is	to	make	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	like	the	prophet	.	and	the	prophet	,	in	one	of	his	 say 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	adorn	 your 	 s 	 elves 	 	with	the	 attribut 	 es 	 	of	god	.	``
and	 be 	 cause 	 	god	 him 	 self 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	that	the	 prim 	 ary 	 	 attribut 	 e 	 	of	his	is	 compass 	 ion 	 	--	in	fact	,	the	koran	 say 	 s 	 	that	``	god	 dec 	 re 	 ed 	 	 up 	 on 	 	 him 	 self 	 	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	``	or	,	``	 reign 	 ed 	 	 him 	 self 	 	in	by	 compass 	 ion 	 	``	--
 there 	 fore 	 	,	our	 object 	 ive 	 	and	our	mission	must	be	to	be	 source 	 s 	 	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	 activ 	 ators 	 	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	 act 	 ors 	 	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	and	 speaker 	 s 	 	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	and	 do 	 ers 	 	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
that	is	all	well	and	good	,	but	where	do	we	go	wrong	,	and	what	is	the	source	of	the	lack	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	in	the	world	?
for	the	answer	to	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	turn	to	our	spiritual	path	.
in	every	religious	tradition	,	there	is	the	 out 	 er 	 	path	and	the	inner	path	,	or	the	 exo 	 ter 	 ic 	 	path	and	the	esoteric	path	.
the	esoteric	path	of	islam	is	more	 popular 	 ly 	 	known	 a 	 s 	 	sufism	,	or	``	tasawwuf	``	in	arabic	.
and	these	 doctor 	 s 	 	or	these	 master 	 s 	 	,	these	spiritual	 master 	 s 	 	of	the	sufi	tradition	,	refer	to	 teach 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	our	prophet	that	teach	us	where	the	source	of	our	 problem 	 s 	 	lies	.	in	one	of	the	 battle 	 s 	 	that	the	prophet	 wage 	 d 	 	,	he	told	his	 follow 	 ers 	 	,	``	we	are	 return 	 ing 	 	from	the	 less 	 er 	 	war	to	the	 great 	 er 	 	war	,	to	the	 great 	 er 	 	battle	.	``
and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	messenger	of	god	,	we	are	battle	-	 wear 	 y 	 	.
how	can	we	go	to	a	 great 	 er 	 	battle	?	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	that	is	the	battle	of	the	self	,	the	battle	of	the	ego	.	``
the	 source 	 s 	 	of	human	 problem 	 s 	 	have	to	do	with	 egot 	 ism 	 	,	``	i.	``
the	famous	sufi	master	rumi	,	who	is	 ver 	 y 	 	well	known	to	most	of	you	,	 ha 	 s 	 	a	story	in	which	he	 talk 	 s 	 	of	a	man	who	 go 	 es 	 	to	the	house	of	a	friend	,	and	he	 knock 	 s 	 	on	the	door	,	and	a	voice	 answer 	 s 	 	,	``	who	's	there	?	``
``	it	's	me	,	``	or	,	more	 grammatical 	 ly 	 	 correct 	 ly 	 	,	``	it	is	i	,	``	 a 	 s 	 	we	might	say	in	english	.
the	voice	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	go	away	.	``
after	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	of	training	,	of	 discip 	 lining 	 	,	of	search	and	struggle	,	he	 come 	 s 	 	back	.	with	much	 great 	 er 	 	 humil 	 ity 	 	,	he	 knock 	 s 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	on	the	door	.
the	voice	 ask 	 s 	 	,	``	who	is	there	?	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	it	is	you	,	o	 heart 	 breaker 	 	.	``
the	door	 s 	 wing 	 s 	 	open	,	and	the	voice	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	come	in	,	for	there	is	no	room	in	 th 	 is 	 	house	for	two	i	's	,	``	--	two	capital	i	's	,	not	these	 eye 	 s 	 	--	``	for	two	 ego 	 s 	 	.	``
and	rumi	's	 st 	 ories 	 	are	 metaphor 	 s 	 	for	the	spiritual	path	.	in	the	presence	of	god	,	there	is	no	room	for	more	than	one	``	i	,	``	and	that	is	the	``	i	``	of	 div 	 in 	 ity 	 	.
in	a	 teach 	 ing 	 	--	 call 	 ed 	 	a	``	 ha 	 di 	 th 	 	 qu 	 d 	 s 	 i 	 	``	in	our	tradition	--	god	 say 	 s 	 	that	,	``	my	 serv 	 ant 	 	,	``	or	``	my	creature	,	my	human	creature	,	 do 	 es 	 	not	approach	me	by	 any 	 thing 	 	that	is	 dear 	 er 	 	to	me	than	what	i	have	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	to	do	.	``
and	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	are	 employ 	 ers 	 	know	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	i	mean	.
you	want	your	 employ 	 ees 	 	to	do	what	you	ask	them	to	do	,	and	if	they	've	 d 	 one 	 	that	,	then	they	can	do	extra	.	but	do	n't	 ignor 	 e 	 	what	you	've	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	to	do	.
``	and	,	``	god	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	my	 serv 	 ant 	 	 continu 	 es 	 	to	get	 near 	 er 	 	to	me	,	by	 do 	 ing 	 	more	of	what	i	've	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	to	do	``	--	extra	credit	,	we	might	call	it	--	``	 un 	 til 	 	i	love	him	or	love	her	.
and	when	i	love	my	 serv 	 ant 	 	,	``	god	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	 be 	 come 	 	the	 eye 	 s 	 	by	which	he	or	she	 s 	 ees 	 	,	the	 ear 	 s 	 	by	which	he	or	she	 listen 	 s 	 	,	the	hand	by	which	he	or	she	 grasp 	 s 	 	,	and	the	foot	by	which	he	or	she	 walk 	 s 	 	,	and	the	heart	by	which	he	or	she	 understand 	 s 	 	.	``
it	is	 th 	 is 	 	 mer 	 ging 	 	of	our	self	with	 div 	 in 	 ity 	 	that	is	the	 less 	 on 	 	and	purpose	of	our	spiritual	path	and	all	of	our	faith	 tradition 	 s 	 	.
muslims	regard	jesus	 a 	 s 	 	the	master	of	sufism	,	the	 great 	 est 	 	prophet	and	messenger	who	came	to	 emphas 	 ize 	 	the	spiritual	path	.
when	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	am	the	spirit	,	and	i	am	the	way	,	``	and	when	the	prophet	muhammad	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 who 	 ever 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 een 	 	me	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 een 	 	god	,	``
it	is	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 be 	 came 	 	so	much	an	instrument	of	god	,	they	 be 	 came 	 	part	of	god	's	team	--	so	that	god	's	will	was	manifest	through	them	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	not	 act 	 ing 	 	from	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 s 	 elves 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 ego 	 s 	 	.
 compass 	 ion 	 	on	earth	is	 give 	 n 	 	,	it	is	in	us	.
all	we	have	to	do	is	to	get	our	 ego 	 s 	 	out	of	the	way	,	get	our	 egot 	 ism 	 	out	of	the	way	.	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	all	of	you	here	,	or	 certain 	 ly 	 	the	 ver 	 y 	 	vast	 major 	 ity 	 	of	you	,	have	had	what	you	might	call	a	spiritual	experience	,	a	moment	in	your	 live 	 s 	 	when	,	for	a	few	 second 	 s 	 	,	a	minute	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	the	 bound 	 aries 	 	of	your	ego	 dis 	 solve 	 d 	 	.
and	at	that	minute	,	you	felt	at	one	with	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	--	one	with	that	jug	of	water	,	one	with	every	human	 be 	 ing 	 	,	one	with	the	creator	--	and	you	felt	you	 we 	 re 	 	in	the	presence	of	power	,	of	awe	,	of	the	 deep 	 est 	 	love	,	the	 deep 	 est 	 	sense	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	and	 merc 	 y 	 	that	you	have	ever	 experience 	 d 	 	in	your	 live 	 s 	 	.
that	is	a	moment	which	is	a	gift	of	god	to	us	--	a	gift	when	,	for	a	moment	,	he	 lift 	 s 	 	that	 bound 	 ary 	 	which	 make 	 s 	 	us	insist	on	``	i	,	i	,	i	,	me	,	me	,	me	,	``	and	 in 	 stead 	 	,	like	the	person	in	rumi	's	story	,	we	say	,	``	oh	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	you	.

for	the	koran	 al 	 ways 	 	 urge 	 s 	 	us	to	remember	,	to	 re 	 mind 	 	each	other	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	knowledge	of	truth	is	 with 	 in 	 	every	human	 be 	 ing 	 	.
we	know	it	all	.
we	have	access	to	it	all	.
jung	may	have	 call 	 ed 	 	it	``	the	 sub 	 conscious 	 	.	``
through	our	 sub 	 conscious 	 	,	in	your	 dream 	 s 	 	--	the	koran	 call 	 s 	 	our	state	of	sleep	``	the	 less 	 er 	 	death	,	``	``	the	 tempor 	 ary 	 	death	``	--
in	our	state	of	sleep	we	have	 dream 	 s 	 	,	we	have	 vision 	 s 	 	,	we	travel	even	 out 	 side 	 	of	our	bodies	,	for	 man 	 y 	 	of	us	,	and	we	see	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
we	travel	beyond	the	 limit 	 ations 	 	of	space	 a 	 s 	 	we	know	it	,	and	beyond	the	 limit 	 ations 	 	of	time	 a 	 s 	 	we	know	it	.
but	all	 th 	 is 	 	is	for	us	to	 glor 	 ify 	 	the	name	of	the	creator	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 prim 	 ary 	 	name	is	the	 compass 	 ion 	 ating 	 	,	the	 com 	 passionate 	 	.
god	,	bokh	,	 what 	 ever 	 	name	you	want	to	call	him	with	,	allah	,	ram	,	om	,	 what 	 ever 	 	the	name	might	be	through	which	you	name	or	access	the	presence	of	 div 	 in 	 ity 	 	,	it	is	the	 locu 	 s 	 	of	absolute	 be 	 ing 	 	,	absolute	love	and	 merc 	 y 	 	and	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	and	absolute	knowledge	and	 wis 	 dom 	 	,	what	hindus	call	``	 satchid 	 ananda 	 	.	``
the	language	 differ 	 s 	 	,	but	the	 object 	 ive 	 	is	the	same	.
rumi	 ha 	 s 	 	 an 	 other 	 	story	about	three	men	,	a	turk	,	an	arab	and	--	and	i	forget	the	third	person	,	but	for	my	sake	,	it	could	be	a	malay	.
one	is	 ask 	 ing 	 	for	 angu 	 r 	 	--	one	is	,	say	,	an	englishman	--	one	is	 ask 	 ing 	 	for	eneb	,	and	one	is	 ask 	 ing 	 	for	 grape 	 s 	 	.
and	they	have	a	fight	and	an	argument	 be 	 cause 	 	--	``	i	want	 grape 	 s 	 	.	``	``	i	want	eneb	.	``	i	want	 angu 	 r 	 	.	``	--	not	 know 	 ing 	 	that	the	word	that	they	're	using	 refer 	 s 	 	to	the	same	 re 	 ality 	 	in	different	 language 	 s 	 	.
there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	one	absolute	 re 	 ality 	 	by	definition	,	one	absolute	 be 	 ing 	 	by	definition	,	 be 	 cause 	 	absolute	is	,	by	definition	,	single	,	and	absolute	and	 s 	 ing 	 ular 	 	.
there	's	 th 	 is 	 	absolute	 concent 	 ration 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	,	the	absolute	 concent 	 ration 	 	of	 conscious 	 ness 	 	,	 aware 	 ness 	 	,	an	absolute	 locu 	 s 	 	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	and	love	that	 define 	 s 	 	the	 prim 	 ary 	 	 attribut 	 es 	 	of	 div 	 in 	 ity 	 	.
and	these	should	 al 	 so 	 	be	the	 prim 	 ary 	 	 attribut 	 es 	 	of	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	to	be	human	.
for	what	 define 	 s 	 	 human 	 ity 	 	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 bio 	 logically 	 	,	is	our	physiology	,	but	god	 define 	 s 	 	 human 	 ity 	 	by	our	 spiritual 	 ity 	 	,	by	our	nature	.
and	the	koran	 say 	 s 	 	,	he	 speak 	 s 	 	to	the	 angel 	 s 	 	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	when	i	have	 finish 	 ed 	 	the	 form 	 ation 	 	of	adam	from	clay	,	and	 breath 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	him	of	my	spirit	,	then	,	fall	in	 prost 	 ration 	 	to	him	.	``
the	 angel 	 s 	 	 prost 	 rate 	 	,	not	before	the	human	body	,	but	before	the	human	soul	.
why	?	 be 	 cause 	 	the	soul	,	the	human	soul	,	 embodi 	 es 	 	a	piece	of	the	divine	breath	,	a	piece	of	the	divine	soul	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	 express 	 ed 	 	in	biblical	 vocabul 	 ary 	 	when	we	are	taught	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 create 	 d 	 	in	the	divine	image	.
what	is	the	 image 	 ry 	 	of	god	?
the	 image 	 ry 	 	of	god	is	absolute	 be 	 ing 	 	,	absolute	 aware 	 ness 	 	and	knowledge	and	 wis 	 dom 	 	and	absolute	 compass 	 ion 	 	and	love	.

 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	understand	from	my	faith	tradition	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	understand	from	my	 stud 	 ies 	 	of	other	faith	 tradition 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	common	platform	on	which	we	must	all	stand	,	and	when	we	stand	on	 th 	 is 	 	platform	 a 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	,	i	am	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	that	we	can	make	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	world	.
