power	.
that	is	the	word	that	 come 	 s 	 	to	mind	.
we	're	the	new	 techno 	 logists 	 	.
we	have	a	lot	of	data	,	so	we	have	a	lot	of	power	.
how	much	power	do	we	have	?
scene	from	a	movie	:	``	 apocalyp 	 s 	 e 	 	now	``	--	great	movie	.
we	've	got	to	get	our	hero	,	 cap 	 tain 	 	willard	,	to	the	mouth	of	the	nung	river	so	he	can	go	pursue	colonel	kurtz	.
the	way	we	're	going	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	is	fly	him	in	and	drop	him	off	.
so	the	scene	:	the	sky	is	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	fleet	of	 helicopter 	 s 	 	 carry 	 ing 	 	him	in	.
and	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	loud	,	 thrill 	 ing 	 	music	in	the	 back 	 ground 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	wild	music	.
♫	 d 	 um 	 	da	ta	da	 d 	 um 	 	♫	♫	 d 	 um 	 	da	ta	da	 d 	 um 	 	♫	♫	da	ta	da	da	♫	that	's	a	lot	of	power	.
that	's	the	kind	of	power	i	feel	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	.
that	's	the	kind	of	power	we	have	 be 	 cause 	 	of	all	of	the	data	that	we	have	.
let	's	take	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
what	can	we	do	with	just	one	person	's	data	?
what	can	we	do	with	that	guy	's	data	?
i	can	look	at	your	financial	 record 	 s 	 	.
i	can	tell	if	you	pay	your	 bill 	 s 	 	on	time	.
i	know	if	you	're	good	to	give	a	loan	to	.
i	can	look	at	your	medical	 record 	 s 	 	;	i	can	see	if	your	pump	is	still	 pump 	 ing 	 	--	see	if	you	're	good	to	 off 	 er 	 	 insur 	 ance 	 	to	.
i	can	look	at	your	 click 	 ing 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	.
when	you	come	to	my	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	know	what	you	're	going	to	do	 al 	 ready 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	've	 s 	 een 	 	you	visit	 million 	 s 	 	of	 web 	 s 	 ites 	 	before	.
and	i	'm	sorry	to	tell	you	,	you	're	like	a	 poke 	 r 	 	player	,	you	have	a	tell	.
i	can	tell	with	data	analysis	what	you	're	going	to	do	before	you	even	do	it	.
i	know	what	you	like	.	i	know	who	you	are	,
and	that	's	even	before	i	look	at	your	mail	or	your	phone	.
 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	we	can	do	with	the	data	that	we	have	.
but	i	'm	not	 actual 	 ly 	 	here	to	talk	about	what	we	can	do	.
i	'm	here	to	talk	about	what	we	should	do	.
what	's	the	right	thing	to	do	?
now	i	see	some	 puzzl 	 ed 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	,	``	why	are	you	 ask 	 ing 	 	us	what	's	the	right	thing	to	do	?
we	're	just	building	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	.	 some 	 body 	 	else	is	using	it	.	``	fair	 en 	 ough 	 	.
but	it	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	me	back	.
i	think	about	world	war	ii	--	some	of	our	great	 techno 	 logists 	 	then	,	some	of	our	great	 physicist 	 s 	 	,	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	nuclear	 fi 	 s 	 s 	 ion 	 	and	fusion	--	just	nuclear	stuff	.
we	gather	together	these	 physicist 	 s 	 	in	los	alamos	to	see	what	they	'll	build	.
we	want	the	people	building	the	technology	 think 	 ing 	 	about	what	we	should	be	 do 	 ing 	 	with	the	technology	.
so	what	should	we	be	 do 	 ing 	 	with	that	guy	's	data	?
should	we	be	 collect 	 ing 	 	it	,	 gather 	 ing 	 	it	,	so	we	can	make	his	 on 	 line 	 	experience	better	?
so	we	can	make	money	?
so	we	can	protect	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	if	he	was	up	to	no	good	?
or	should	we	respect	his	 pri 	 vac 	 y 	 	,	protect	his	dignity	and	 leav 	 e 	 	him	 al 	 one 	 	?
which	one	is	it	?
how	should	we	figure	it	out	?
i	know	:	 crowd 	 source 	 	.	let	's	 crowd 	 source 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	to	get	people	 warm 	 ed 	 	up	,	let	's	start	with	an	easy	question	--	 some 	 thing 	 	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	 every 	 body 	 	here	 ha 	 s 	 	an	opinion	about	:	iphone	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	android	.
let	's	do	a	show	of	 hand 	 s 	 	--	iphone	.
uh	huh	.
android	.
you	'd	think	with	a	bunch	of	smart	people	we	would	n't	be	 s 	 uch 	 	 suck 	 ers 	 	just	for	the	 pre 	 tty 	 	 phone 	 s 	 	.
next	question	,
a	little	bit	 hard 	 er 	 	.
should	we	be	 collect 	 ing 	 	all	of	that	guy	's	data	to	make	his	 experience 	 s 	 	better	and	to	protect	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	case	he	's	up	to	no	good	?
or	should	we	 leav 	 e 	 	him	 al 	 one 	 	?
collect	his	data	.
 leav 	 e 	 	him	 al 	 one 	 	.
you	're	safe	.	it	's	fine	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	last	question	--	 hard 	 er 	 	question	--	when	 try 	 ing 	 	to	evaluate	what	we	should	do	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	should	we	use	a	kantian	 de 	 onto 	 logical 	 	moral	 frame 	 work 	 	,	or	should	we	use	a	millian	 con 	 sequent 	 ial 	 ist 	 	one	?
kant	.
mill	.
not	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 vote 	 s 	 	.
 yea 	 h 	 	,	that	's	a	 terrify 	 ing 	 	result	.
 terrify 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	 strong 	 er 	 	 opinion 	 s 	 	about	our	hand	-	held	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	than	about	the	moral	 frame 	 work 	 	we	should	use	to	guide	our	 decision 	 s 	 	.
how	do	we	know	what	to	do	with	all	the	power	we	have	if	we	do	n't	have	a	moral	 frame 	 work 	 	?
we	know	more	about	mobile	 oper 	 ating 	 	 system 	 s 	 	,	but	what	we	 re 	 ally 	 	need	is	a	moral	 oper 	 ating 	 	system	.
what	's	a	moral	 oper 	 ating 	 	system	?
we	all	know	right	and	wrong	,	right	?
you	feel	good	when	you	do	 some 	 thing 	 	right	,	you	feel	bad	when	you	do	 some 	 thing 	 	wrong	.
our	 parent 	 s 	 	teach	us	that	:	praise	with	the	good	,	 s 	 cold 	 	with	the	bad	.
but	how	do	we	figure	out	what	's	right	and	wrong	?
and	from	day	to	day	,	we	have	the	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	that	we	use	.
 may 	 be 	 	we	just	follow	our	gut	.
 may 	 be 	 	we	take	a	vote	--	we	 crowd 	 source 	 	.
or	 may 	 be 	 	we	 pun 	 t 	 	--	ask	the	legal	 depart 	 ment 	 	,	see	what	they	say	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	it	's	kind	of	random	,	kind	of	ad	hoc	,	how	we	figure	out	what	we	should	do	.
and	 may 	 be 	 	,	if	we	want	to	be	on	 sur 	 er 	 	 foot 	 ing 	 	,	what	we	 re 	 ally 	 	want	is	a	moral	 frame 	 work 	 	that	will	help	guide	us	there	,	that	will	tell	us	what	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	are	right	and	wrong	in	the	first	place	,	and	how	would	we	know	in	a	 give 	 n 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	what	to	do	.
so	let	's	get	a	moral	 frame 	 work 	 	.
we	're	 number 	 s 	 	people	,	living	by	 number 	 s 	 	.
how	can	we	use	 number 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 bas 	 is 	 	for	a	moral	 frame 	 work 	 	?
i	know	a	guy	who	did	 exact 	 ly 	 	that	.	a	 brilli 	 ant 	 	guy	--	he	's	 be 	 en 	 	dead	2,500	 year 	 s 	 	.
plato	,	that	's	right	.
remember	him	--	old	 philosoph 	 er 	 	?
you	 we 	 re 	 	 sleep 	 ing 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	that	class	.
and	plato	,	he	had	a	lot	of	the	same	 concern 	 s 	 	that	we	did	.
he	was	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	right	and	wrong	.
he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	know	what	is	just	.
but	he	was	 worri 	 ed 	 	that	all	we	seem	to	be	 do 	 ing 	 	is	 tra 	 d 	 ing 	 	 opinion 	 s 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
he	 say 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	's	just	.	she	 say 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	else	is	just	.
it	's	kind	of	convincing	when	he	 talk 	 s 	 	and	when	she	 talk 	 s 	 	too	.
i	'm	just	going	back	and	forth	;	i	'm	not	 get 	 ting 	 	 any 	 where 	 	.
i	do	n't	want	 opinion 	 s 	 	;	i	want	knowledge	.
i	want	to	know	the	truth	about	justice	--	like	we	have	 truth 	 s 	 	in	math	.
in	math	,	we	know	the	 object 	 ive 	 	 fact 	 s 	 	.
take	a	number	,	any	number	--	two	.
 favor 	 ite 	 	number	.	i	love	that	number	.
there	are	 truth 	 s 	 	about	two	.
if	you	've	got	two	of	 some 	 thing 	 	,	you	add	two	more	,	you	get	four	.
that	's	true	no	matter	what	thing	you	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	.
it	's	an	 object 	 ive 	 	truth	about	the	form	of	two	,	the	abstract	form	.
when	you	have	two	of	 any 	 thing 	 	--	two	 eye 	 s 	 	,	two	 ear 	 s 	 	,	two	 nose 	 s 	 	,	just	two	 protr 	 usion 	 s 	 	--	 t 	 hose 	 	all	 par 	 take 	 	of	the	form	of	two	.
they	all	 particip 	 ate 	 	in	the	 truth 	 s 	 	that	two	 ha 	 s 	 	.
they	all	have	two	-	ness	in	them	.
and	 there 	 fore 	 	,	it	's	not	a	matter	of	opinion	.
what	if	,	plato	thought	,	 ethic 	 s 	 	was	like	math	?
what	if	there	 we 	 re 	 	a	 pur 	 e 	 	form	of	justice	?
what	if	there	are	 truth 	 s 	 	about	justice	,	and	you	could	just	look	around	in	 th 	 is 	 	world	and	see	which	 thing 	 s 	 	 particip 	 ated 	 	,	 par 	 took 	 	of	that	form	of	justice	?
then	you	would	know	what	was	 re 	 ally 	 	just	and	what	was	n't	.
it	would	n't	be	a	matter	of	just	opinion	or	just	 appear 	 ance 	 s 	 	.
that	's	a	 stunn 	 ing 	 	vision	.
i	mean	,	think	about	that	.	how	grand	.	how	 ambit 	 ious 	 	.
that	's	 a 	 s 	 	 ambit 	 ious 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	are	.
he	 want 	 s 	 	to	solve	 ethic 	 s 	 	.
he	 want 	 s 	 	 object 	 ive 	 	 truth 	 s 	 	.
if	you	think	that	way	,	you	have	a	platonist	moral	 frame 	 work 	 	.
if	you	do	n't	think	that	way	,	well	,	you	have	a	lot	of	company	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	western	 philosoph 	 y 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	tidy	idea	,	you	know	,	people	 critic 	 ized 	 	it	.
aristotle	,	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	he	was	not	 amuse 	 d 	 	.
he	thought	it	was	 im 	 practical 	 	.
aristotle	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	should	seek	 on 	 ly 	 	so	much	 pre 	 cis 	 ion 	 	in	each	subject	 a 	 s 	 	that	subject	 allow 	 s 	 	.	``	aristotle	thought	 ethic 	 s 	 	was	n't	a	lot	like	math	.
he	thought	 ethic 	 s 	 	was	a	matter	of	making	 decision 	 s 	 	in	the	here	-	and	-	now	using	our	best	judgment	to	find	the	right	path	.
if	you	think	that	,	plato	's	not	your	guy	.
but	do	n't	give	up	.
 may 	 be 	 	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	way	that	we	can	use	 number 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	our	moral	 frame 	 work 	 	.
how	about	 th 	 is 	 	:	what	if	in	any	 situ 	 ation 	 	you	could	just	 calcul 	 ate 	 	,	look	at	the	 choice 	 s 	 	,	measure	out	which	one	's	better	and	know	what	to	do	?
that	sound	familiar	?
that	's	a	 util 	 itarian 	 	moral	 frame 	 work 	 	.
john	stuart	mill	was	a	great	 advoc 	 ate 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	--	nice	guy	 be 	 side 	 s 	 	--	and	 on 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	dead	200	 year 	 s 	 	.
so	 bas 	 is 	 	of	 util 	 itarianism 	 	--	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	you	're	familiar	at	 l 	 east 	 	.
the	three	people	who	 vot 	 ed 	 	for	mill	before	are	familiar	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	here	's	the	way	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
what	if	 moral 	 s 	 	,	what	if	what	 make 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	moral	is	just	a	matter	of	if	it	 maxim 	 ize 	 s 	 	pleasure	and	 minim 	 ize 	 s 	 	pain	?
it	 do 	 es 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	intrinsic	to	the	act	.
it	's	not	like	 it 	 s 	 	relation	to	some	abstract	form	.
it	's	just	a	matter	of	the	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	.
you	just	look	at	the	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	and	see	if	,	 over 	 all 	 	,	it	's	for	the	good	or	for	the	 wo 	 rse 	 	.
that	would	be	simple	.	then	we	know	what	to	do	.
let	's	take	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
suppose	i	go	up	and	i	say	,	``	i	'm	going	to	take	your	phone	.	``	not	just	 be 	 cause 	 	it	rang	 ear 	 lier 	 	,	but	i	'm	going	to	take	it	 be 	 cause 	 	i	made	a	little	 calcul 	 ation 	 	.
i	thought	,	that	guy	 look 	 s 	 	suspicious	.
and	what	if	he	's	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	little	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	to	bin	laden	's	 hide 	 out 	 	--	or	 who 	 ever 	 	took	over	after	bin	laden	--	and	he	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	like	a	terrorist	,	a	 sleep 	 er 	 	cell	.
i	'm	going	to	find	that	out	,	and	when	i	find	that	out	,	i	'm	going	to	prevent	a	huge	amount	of	damage	that	he	could	cause	.
that	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	high	 util 	 ity 	 	to	prevent	that	damage	.	and	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	the	little	pain	that	it	's	going	to	cause	--	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	going	to	be	 embarrass 	 ing 	 	when	i	'm	looking	on	his	phone	and	 see 	 ing 	 	that	he	 ha 	 s 	 	a	farmville	problem	and	that	whole	bit	--	that	's	 overwhelm 	 ed 	 	by	the	value	of	looking	at	the	phone	.
if	you	feel	that	way	,	that	's	a	 util 	 itarian 	 	choice	.
but	 may 	 be 	 	you	do	n't	feel	that	way	either	.
 may 	 be 	 	you	think	,	it	's	his	phone	.
it	's	wrong	to	take	his	phone	 be 	 cause 	 	he	's	a	person	and	he	 ha 	 s 	 	 right 	 s 	 	and	he	 ha 	 s 	 	dignity	,	and	we	ca	n't	just	interfere	with	that	.
he	 ha 	 s 	 	 auto 	 nomy 	 	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	what	the	 calcul 	 ations 	 	are	.
there	are	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 intrinsic 	 ally 	 	wrong	--	like	 ly 	 ing 	 	is	wrong	,	like	 tor 	 tur 	 ing 	 	 innoc 	 ent 	 	children	is	wrong	.
kant	was	 ver 	 y 	 	good	on	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	it	a	little	better	than	i	'll	say	it	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	we	should	use	our	reason	to	figure	out	the	 rule 	 s 	 	by	which	we	should	guide	our	conduct	,
and	then	it	is	our	duty	to	follow	 t 	 hose 	 	 rule 	 s 	 	.
it	's	not	a	matter	of	 calcul 	 ation 	 	.
so	let	's	stop	.
we	're	right	in	the	thick	of	it	,	 th 	 is 	 	 philosoph 	 ical 	 	 thick 	 et 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 go 	 es 	 	on	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	these	are	hard	 question 	 s 	 	,	and	i	've	 on 	 ly 	 	got	15	 minute 	 s 	 	.
so	let	's	cut	to	the	chase	.
how	should	we	be	making	our	 decision 	 s 	 	?
is	it	plato	,	is	it	aristotle	,	is	it	kant	,	is	it	mill	?
what	should	we	be	 do 	 ing 	 	?	what	's	the	answer	?
what	's	the	formula	that	we	can	use	in	any	 situ 	 ation 	 	to	determine	what	we	should	do	,
 whet 	 her 	 	we	should	use	that	guy	's	data	or	not	?
what	's	the	formula	?
there	's	not	a	formula	.
there	's	not	a	simple	answer	.
 ethic 	 s 	 	is	hard	.
 ethic 	 s 	 	 requir 	 es 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	.
and	that	's	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	.
i	know	;	i	 s 	 pent 	 	a	lot	of	my	 care 	 er 	 	in	artificial	 intellig 	 ence 	 	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	build	 machine 	 s 	 	that	could	do	some	of	 th 	 is 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	for	us	,	that	could	give	us	 answer 	 s 	 	.
but	they	ca	n't	.
you	ca	n't	just	take	human	 think 	 ing 	 	and	put	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	machine	.
we	're	the	 one 	 s 	 	who	have	to	do	it	.
 hap 	 pi 	 ly 	 	,	we	're	not	 machine 	 s 	 	,	and	we	can	do	it	.
not	 on 	 ly 	 	can	we	think	,	we	must	.
hannah	arendt	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	the	 s 	 ad 	 	truth	is	that	most	 e 	 vil 	 	 d 	 one 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	world	is	not	 d 	 one 	 	by	people	who	 choos 	 e 	 	to	be	 e 	 vil 	 	.
it	 arise 	 s 	 	from	not	 think 	 ing 	 	.	``	that	's	what	she	 call 	 ed 	 	the	``	 ban 	 ality 	 	of	 e 	 vil 	 	.	``	and	the	 respons 	 e 	 	to	that	is	that	we	demand	the	 exercis 	 e 	 	of	 think 	 ing 	 	from	every	 s 	 ane 	 	person	.
so	let	's	do	that	.	let	's	think	.
in	fact	,	let	's	start	right	now	.
every	person	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	do	 th 	 is 	 	:	think	of	the	last	time	you	had	a	decision	to	make	where	you	 we 	 re 	 	 worri 	 ed 	 	to	do	the	right	thing	,	where	you	 wonder 	 ed 	 	,	``	what	should	i	be	 do 	 ing 	 	?	``	 br 	 ing 	 	that	to	mind	,
and	now	reflect	on	that	and	say	,	``	how	did	i	come	up	that	decision	?
what	did	i	do	?	did	i	follow	my	gut	?
did	i	have	 some 	 body 	 	vote	on	it	?	or	did	i	 pun 	 t 	 	to	legal	?	``	or	now	we	have	a	few	more	 choice 	 s 	 	.
``	did	i	evaluate	what	would	be	the	highest	pleasure	like	mill	would	?
or	like	kant	,	did	i	use	reason	to	figure	out	what	was	 intrinsic 	 ally 	 	right	?	``
think	about	it	.	 re 	 ally 	 	 br 	 ing 	 	it	to	mind	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 import 	 ant 	 	.
it	is	so	 import 	 ant 	 	we	are	going	to	 s 	 pend 	 	30	 second 	 s 	 	of	 valu 	 able 	 	tedtalk	time	 do 	 ing 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	but	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
are	you	ready	?	go	.
stop	.	good	work	.
what	you	just	did	,	that	's	the	first	step	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	taking	 respons 	 ibility 	 	for	what	we	should	do	with	all	of	our	power	.
now	the	next	step	--	try	 th 	 is 	 	.
go	find	a	friend	and	explain	to	them	how	you	made	that	decision	.
not	right	now	.	wait	till	i	finish	 talk 	 ing 	 	.
do	it	over	lunch	.
and	do	n't	just	find	 an 	 other 	 	 techno 	 logist 	 	friend	;	find	 some 	 body 	 	different	than	you	.
find	an	artist	or	a	writer	--	or	,	heaven	forbid	,	find	a	 philosoph 	 er 	 	and	talk	to	them	.
in	fact	,	find	 some 	 body 	 	from	the	 human 	 ities 	 	.
why	?	 be 	 cause 	 	they	think	about	 problem 	 s 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	than	we	do	 a 	 s 	 	 techno 	 logists 	 	.
just	a	few	 day 	 s 	 	ago	,	right	 a 	 cross 	 	the	street	from	here	,	there	was	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	people	 gather 	 ed 	 	together	.
it	was	 techno 	 logists 	 	and	 human 	 ists 	 	at	that	big	bibliotech	 con 	 ference 	 	.
and	they	 gather 	 ed 	 	together	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 techno 	 logists 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	learn	what	it	would	be	like	to	think	from	a	 human 	 ities 	 	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	.
you	have	 some 	 one 	 	from	google	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	 some 	 one 	 	who	 do 	 es 	 	 compar 	 ative 	 	 liter 	 ature 	 	.
you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	relevance	of	17th	century	french	theater	--	how	 do 	 es 	 	that	bear	 up 	 on 	 	venture	capital	?
well	that	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	.	that	's	a	different	way	of	 think 	 ing 	 	.
and	when	you	think	in	that	way	,	you	 be 	 come 	 	more	sensitive	to	the	human	 consider 	 ations 	 	,	which	are	 cruci 	 al 	 	to	making	 ethic 	 al 	 	 decision 	 s 	 	.
so	imagine	that	right	now	you	went	and	you	found	your	 music 	 ian 	 	friend	.
and	you	're	 tell 	 ing 	 	him	what	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	,	about	our	whole	data	revolution	and	all	 th 	 is 	 	--	 may 	 be 	 	even	hum	a	few	 bar 	 s 	 	of	our	theme	music	.
♫	 d 	 um 	 	ta	da	da	 d 	 um 	 	 d 	 um 	 	ta	da	da	 d 	 um 	 	♫	well	,	your	 music 	 ian 	 	friend	will	stop	you	and	say	,	``	you	know	,	the	theme	music	for	your	data	revolution	,	that	's	an	opera	,	that	's	wagner	.
it	's	based	on	norse	legend	.
it	's	 god 	 s 	 	and	 myth 	 ical 	 	 creature 	 s 	 	 fight 	 ing 	 	over	 magic 	 al 	 	 jewel 	 ry 	 	.	``	that	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
now	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	opera	,
and	we	're	 move 	 d 	 	by	that	opera	.
we	're	 move 	 d 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	about	the	battle	between	good	and	 e 	 vil 	 	,	about	right	and	wrong	.
and	we	care	about	right	and	wrong	.
we	care	what	 happen 	 s 	 	in	that	opera	.
we	care	what	 happen 	 s 	 	in	``	 apocalyp 	 s 	 e 	 	now	.	``
and	we	 certain 	 ly 	 	care	what	 happen 	 s 	 	with	our	 techno 	 logies 	 	.
we	have	so	much	power	 to 	 day 	 	,	it	is	up	to	us	to	figure	out	what	to	do	,
and	that	's	the	good	news	.
we	're	the	 one 	 s 	 	writing	 th 	 is 	 	opera	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	our	movie	.
we	figure	out	what	will	happen	with	 th 	 is 	 	technology	.
we	determine	how	 th 	 is 	 	will	all	end	.
thank	you	.
