 th 	 is 	 	is	the	ocean	 a 	 s 	 	i	used	to	know	it	.
and	i	find	that	since	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	in	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	a	couple	of	 time 	 s 	 	,	i	 re 	 ally 	 	kind	of	am	 trauma 	 t 	 ized 	 
 be 	 cause 	 	 when 	 ever 	 	i	look	at	the	ocean	now	,	no	matter	where	i	am	,	even	where	i	know	 non 	 e 	 	of	the	oil	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	,	i	sort	of	see	 s 	 lick 	 s 	 	,
and	i	'm	 find 	 ing 	 	that	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	much	 haunt 	 ed 	 	by	it	.
but	what	i	want	to	talk	to	you	about	 to 	 day 	 	is	a	lot	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	try	to	put	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	in	 con 	 text 	 	,	not	just	about	the	oil	 erupt 	 ion 	 	,	but	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	and	why	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
first	,	just	a	little	bit	about	me	.
i	'm	 bas 	 ically 	 	just	a	guy	that	 like 	 s 	 	to	go	 fish 	 ing 	 
ever	since	i	was	a	little	kid	,
and	 be 	 cause 	 	i	did	,	i	wound	up	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	sea	 bird 	 s 	 	to	try	to	stay	in	the	 coast 	 al 	 	 habit 	 at 	 s 	 	that	i	so	 love 	 d 	 	.
and	now	i	 main 	 ly 	 	write	 book 	 s 	 	about	how	the	ocean	is	changing	,
and	the	ocean	is	 certain 	 ly 	 	changing	 ver 	 y 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	.
now	we	saw	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	graphic	 ear 	 lier 	 	on	,	that	we	 re 	 ally 	 	live	on	a	hard	 mar 	 ble 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	just	a	 s 	 light 	 	bit	of	 wet 	 ness 	 	to	it	.
it	's	like	you	dipped	a	 mar 	 ble 	 	in	water	.
and	the	same	thing	with	the	atmosphere	:	if	you	took	all	the	atmosphere	and	 roll 	 ed 	 	it	up	in	a	ball	,	you	would	get	that	little	sphere	of	gas	on	the	right	.
so	we	live	on	the	most	fragile	,	little	soap	bubble	you	can	imagine	,
a	 ver 	 y 	 	sacred	soap	bubble	,	but	one	that	is	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	to	affect	.
and	all	the	 burn 	 ing 	 	of	oil	and	coal	and	gas	,	all	the	fossil	 fuel 	 s 	 	,	have	 change 	 d 	 	the	atmosphere	 great 	 ly 	 	.
carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	level	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	up	and	up	and	up	.
we	're	 warm 	 ing 	 	the	climate	.
so	the	 blow 	 out 	 	in	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	is	just	a	little	piece	of	a	much	 large 	 r 	 	problem	that	we	have	with	the	energy	that	we	use	to	run	 civil 	 ization 	 	.
beyond	 warm 	 ing 	 	,	we	have	the	problem	of	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	more	 acid 	 ified 	 	--	and	 al 	 ready 	 	 measur 	 ably 	 	so	,	and	 al 	 ready 	 	 affect 	 ing 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	.
now	in	the	 labor 	 atory 	 	,	if	you	take	a	clam	and	you	put	it	in	the	ph	that	is	--	not	8.1	,	which	is	the	normal	ph	of	 sea 	 water 	 	--	but	7.5	,	it	 dis 	 solve 	 s 	 	in	about	three	 day 	 s 	 	.
if	you	take	a	sea	urchin	larva	from	8.1	,	put	it	in	a	ph	of	7.7	--	not	a	huge	change	--	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 de 	 form 	 ed 	 	and	dies	.
and	 al 	 ready 	 	,	commercial	oyster	 larva 	 e 	 	are	 dy 	 ing 	 	at	large	 scale 	 s 	 	in	some	 place 	 s 	 	.
coral	 reef 	 s 	 	are	growing	 s 	 lower 	 	in	some	 place 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	problem	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 matter 	 s 	 	.
now	,	let	's	take	a	little	tour	around	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	a	little	bit	.
one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 impress 	 es 	 	me	about	the	people	in	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	:	they	are	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 aqua 	 tic 	 	people	.
and	they	can	handle	water	.
they	can	handle	a	hurricane	that	 come 	 s 	 	and	 go 	 es 	 	.	when	the	water	 go 	 es 	 	down	,	they	know	what	to	do	.
but	when	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	other	than	water	,	and	 the 	 ir 	 	water	 habit 	 at 	 	 change 	 s 	 	,	they	do	n't	have	 man 	 y 	 	 option 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	 t 	 hose 	 	entire	 commun 	 ities 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	do	n't	have	 man 	 y 	 	 option 	 s 	 	.
they	do	n't	have	 an 	 other 	 	thing	they	can	do	.
they	ca	n't	go	and	work	in	the	local	hotel	business	 be 	 cause 	 	there	is	n't	one	in	 the 	 ir 	 	community	.
if	you	go	to	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	and	you	look	around	,	you	do	see	a	lot	of	oil	.
you	see	a	lot	of	oil	on	the	ocean	.
you	see	a	lot	of	oil	on	the	 shore 	 line 	 	.
if	you	go	to	the	 s 	 ite 	 	of	the	 blow 	 out 	 	,	it	 look 	 s 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	.
it	 look 	 s 	 	like	you	just	 empti 	 ed 	 	the	oil	pan	in	your	car	,	and	you	just	 dump 	 ed 	 	it	in	the	ocean	.
and	one	of	the	 re 	 ally 	 	most	 in 	 credible 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	i	think	,	is	that	there	's	 no 	 body 	 	out	there	 try 	 ing 	 	to	collect	it	at	the	 s 	 ite 	 	where	it	is	 dense 	 st 	 	.
 part 	 s 	 	of	the	ocean	there	look	just	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 apocalyp 	 tic 	 	.
you	go	in	 a 	 long 	 	the	shore	,	you	can	find	it	 every 	 where 	 	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 mess 	 y 	 	.
if	you	go	to	the	 place 	 s 	 	where	it	's	just	 arriv 	 ing 	 	,	like	the	eastern	part	of	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	,	in	alabama	,	there	's	still	people	using	the	beach	while	there	are	people	 clean 	 ing 	 	up	the	beach	.
and	they	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	strange	way	of	 clean 	 ing 	 	up	the	beach	.	they	're	not	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	put	more	than	10	 pound 	 s 	 	of	sand	in	a	50	-	gallon	plastic	bag	.
they	have	 thousand 	 s 	 	and	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	plastic	 bag 	 s 	 	.
i	do	n't	know	what	they	're	going	to	do	with	all	that	stuff	.
 mean 	 while 	 	,	there	are	still	people	 try 	 ing 	 	to	use	the	beach	.
they	do	n't	see	the	little	,	 tin 	 y 	 	sign	that	 say 	 s 	 	:	``	stay	out	of	the	water	.	``
 the 	 ir 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	are	in	the	water	;	they	're	 get 	 ting 	 	tar	all	over	 the 	 ir 	 	 clothe 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 sand 	 al 	 s 	 	.	it	's	a	mess	.
if	you	go	to	the	place	where	the	oil	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	while	,	it	's	an	even	 big 	 ger 	 	mess	.
and	there	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	 no 	 body 	 	there	 any 	 more 	 	,	a	few	people	 try 	 ing 	 	to	keep	using	it	.
you	see	people	who	are	 re 	 ally 	 	shell	-	 shock 	 ed 	 	.
they	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 hard 	 work 	 ing 	 	people	.
all	they	know	about	life	is	they	get	up	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	and	if	 the 	 ir 	 	engine	 start 	 s 	 	,	they	go	to	work	.
they	 al 	 ways 	 	felt	that	they	could	 re 	 ly 	 	on	the	 assurance 	 s 	 	that	nature	 br 	 ought 	 	them	through	the	 eco 	 system 	 	of	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	.
they	're	 find 	 ing 	 	that	 the 	 ir 	 	world	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 col 	 lap 	 s 	 ing 	 	.
and	so	you	can	see	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	 sign 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	shock	,	 sign 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 out 	 rage 	 	,	 sign 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	anger	,	and	 sign 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	grief	.
these	are	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	can	see	.
there	's	a	lot	you	ca	n't	see	,	 al 	 so 	 	,	 under 	 water 	 	.
what	's	going	on	 under 	 water 	 	?
well	,	some	people	say	there	are	oil	 plume 	 s 	 	.
some	people	say	there	are	not	oil	 plume 	 s 	 	.
and	 congress 	 man 	 	markey	 ask 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	``	is	it	going	to	take	a	 sub 	 marine 	 	ride	to	see	if	there	are	 re 	 ally 	 	oil	 plume 	 s 	 	?	``
but	i	could	n't	take	a	 sub 	 marine 	 	ride	--	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	between	the	time	i	 k 	 new 	 	i	was	coming	here	and	 to 	 day 	 	--	so	i	had	to	do	a	little	experiment	 my 	 self 	 	to	see	if	there	was	oil	in	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	of	mexico	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	of	mexico	,	 spark 	 ling 	 	place	full	of	fish	.
i	 create 	 d 	 	a	little	oil	 s 	 pill 	 	in	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	of	mexico	.	and	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	--	in	fact	,	i	 confirm 	 ed 	 	--	the	 hypo 	 thesis 	 	that	oil	and	water	do	n't	mix	 un 	 til 	 	you	add	a	 dispers 	 ant 	 	,
and	then	they	start	 mix 	 ing 	 	.
and	you	add	a	little	energy	from	the	wind	and	the	 wave 	 s 	 	,	and	you	get	a	big	mess	,
a	big	mess	that	you	ca	n't	possibly	clean	,	you	ca	n't	touch	,	you	ca	n't	 ex 	 tract 	 	and	,	i	think	most	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	think	--	you	ca	n't	see	it	.
i	think	it	's	 be 	 ing 	 	 hid 	 den 	 	on	purpose	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 catastroph 	 e 	 	and	 s 	 uch 	 	a	mess	,	that	 lot 	 s 	 	of	stuff	is	 leak 	 ing 	 	out	on	the	 edge 	 s 	 	of	the	information	stream	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	have	 s 	 aid 	 	,	there	's	a	large	attempt	to	suppress	what	's	going	on	.
 personal 	 ly 	 	,	i	think	that	the	 dispers 	 ants 	 	are	a	major	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	to	hide	the	body	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	put	the	 murder 	 er 	 	in	charge	of	the	crime	scene	.
but	you	can	see	it	.
you	can	see	where	the	oil	is	 concent 	 rated 	 	at	the	surface	,
and	then	it	is	 attack 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	do	n't	want	the	evidence	,	in	my	opinion	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
we	heard	that	bacteria	eat	oil	?
so	do	sea	 turtle 	 s 	 	.
when	it	 break 	 s 	 	up	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	long	way	to	go	before	it	 get 	 s 	 	down	to	bacteria	.
 turtle 	 s 	 	eat	it	.	it	 get 	 s 	 	in	the	 gill 	 s 	 	of	fish	.	these	 guy 	 s 	 	have	to	swim	around	through	it	.
i	heard	the	most	 in 	 credible 	 	story	 to 	 day 	 	when	i	was	on	the	train	coming	here	.
a	writer	named	ted	williams	 call 	 ed 	 	me	,	and	he	was	 ask 	 ing 	 	me	a	couple	of	 question 	 s 	 	about	what	i	saw	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	's	writing	an	article	for	audubon	magazine	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	that	he	had	 be 	 en 	 	in	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	a	little	while	ago	--	like	about	a	week	ago	--	and	a	guy	who	had	 be 	 en 	 	a	 re 	 creation 	 al 	 	 fish 	 ing 	 	guide	took	him	out	to	show	him	what	's	going	on	.
that	guide	's	entire	calendar	year	is	 cancel 	 ed 	 	 book 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
he	 ha 	 s 	 	no	 book 	 ing 	 s 	 	left	.
 every 	 body 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	deposit	back	.	 every 	 body 	 	is	 flee 	 ing 	 	.
that	's	the	story	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	.
but	he	told	ted	that	on	the	last	day	he	went	out	,	a	 bottle 	 nose 	 	dolphin	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 appear 	 ed 	 	next	to	the	boat	,
and	it	was	 s 	 plat 	 tering 	 	oil	out	 it 	 s 	 	 blow 	 hole 	 	.
and	he	 move 	 d 	 	away	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	his	last	 fish 	 ing 	 	trip	,	and	he	 k 	 new 	 	that	the	 dolphin 	 s 	 	 s 	 care 	 	fish	.
so	he	 move 	 d 	 	away	from	it	,	 turn 	 ed 	 	around	a	few	 minute 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	it	was	right	next	to	the	side	of	the	boat	 aga 	 in 	 	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	that	in	30	 year 	 s 	 	of	 fish 	 ing 	 	he	had	never	 s 	 een 	 	a	dolphin	do	that	.
and	he	felt	that	--
he	felt	that	it	was	coming	to	ask	for	help	.	sorry	.
now	,	in	the	exxon	valdez	 s 	 pill 	 	,	about	30	percent	of	the	killer	 whale 	 s 	 	 di 	 ed 	 	in	the	first	few	 month 	 s 	 	.
 the 	 ir 	 	 number 	 s 	 	have	never	 re 	 cover 	 ed 	 	.
so	the	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	rate	of	all	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	is	going	to	be	 vari 	 able 	 	.
it	's	going	to	take	 long 	 er 	 	for	some	 thing 	 s 	 	.	and	some	 thing 	 s 	 	,	i	think	,	will	 prob 	 ably 	 	come	back	a	little	 fast 	 er 	 	.
the	other	thing	about	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	that	is	 import 	 ant 	 	is	that	there	are	a	lot	of	 animal 	 s 	 	that	 concent 	 rate 	 	in	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	at	certain	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	year	.
so	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	is	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	piece	of	water	--	more	 import 	 ant 	 	than	a	similar	volume	of	water	in	the	open	atlantic	ocean	.
these	tuna	swim	the	entire	ocean	.
they	get	in	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	stream	.	they	go	all	the	way	to	europe	.
when	it	 come 	 s 	 	time	to	spawn	,	they	come	 in 	 side 	 	,
and	these	two	tuna	that	 we 	 re 	 	 tag 	 ged 	 	,
you	can	see	them	on	the	 spawn 	 ing 	 	 ground 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	right	in	the	area	of	the	 s 	 lick 	 	.
they	're	 prob 	 ably 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	,	at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 l 	 east 	 	,	a	 catastroph 	 ic 	 	 spawn 	 ing 	 	season	 th 	 is 	 	year	.
i	'm	 hop 	 ing 	 	that	 may 	 be 	 	the	 adult 	 s 	 	are	 avoid 	 ing 	 	that	 dirt 	 y 	 	water	.
they	do	n't	 usual 	 ly 	 	like	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	water	that	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 cloud 	 y 	 	 any 	 way 	 	.
but	these	are	 re 	 ally 	 	high	-	performance	athletic	 animal 	 s 	 	.
i	do	n't	know	what	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	stuff	will	do	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 gill 	 s 	 	.
i	do	n't	know	if	it	'll	affect	the	 adult 	 s 	 	.
if	it	's	not	,	it	's	 certain 	 ly 	 	 affect 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 egg 	 s 	 	and	 larva 	 e 	 	,	i	would	 certain 	 ly 	 	think	.
but	if	you	look	at	that	graph	that	 go 	 es 	 	down	and	down	and	down	,
that	's	what	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	species	through	 over 	 fish 	 ing 	 	over	 man 	 y 	 	 decade 	 s 	 	.
so	while	the	oil	 s 	 pill 	 	,	the	leak	,	the	 erupt 	 ion 	 	,	is	a	 catastroph 	 e 	 	,	i	think	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	keep	in	mind	that	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	a	lot	to	affect	what	's	in	the	ocean	for	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	long	time	.
it	's	not	like	we	're	 start 	 ing 	 	with	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
we	're	 start 	 ing 	 	with	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	had	a	lot	of	 stress 	 es 	 	and	a	lot	of	 problem 	 s 	 	to	begin	with	.
if	you	look	around	at	the	 bird 	 s 	 	,
there	are	a	lot	of	 bird 	 s 	 	in	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	that	 concent 	 rate 	 	in	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	at	certain	 time 	 s 	 	of	the	year	,	but	then	 leav 	 e 	 	.
and	they	populate	much	 large 	 r 	 	 area 	 s 	 	.
so	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	most	of	the	 bird 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	picture	are	 migr 	 atory 	 	 bird 	 s 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	all	on	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	in	may	,	while	oil	was	 start 	 ing 	 	to	come	 a 	 shore 	 	in	certain	 place 	 s 	 	.
down	on	the	lower	left	there	are	ruddy	turnstones	and	sanderlings	.
they	breed	in	the	high	 arc 	 tic 	 	,	and	they	winter	down	in	southern	south	america	.
but	they	 concent 	 rate 	 	in	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	and	then	fan	out	all	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 arc 	 tic 	 	.
i	saw	 bird 	 s 	 	that	breed	in	greenland	in	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	,
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 hemi 	 spheric 	 	issue	.
the	economic	 effect 	 s 	 	go	at	 l 	 east 	 	 national 	 ly 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	.	the	 bio 	 logical 	 	 effect 	 s 	 	are	 certain 	 ly 	 	 hemi 	 spheric 	 	.
i	think	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	most	 absolute 	 ly 	 	mind	-	boggling	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	total	 un 	 prepared 	 ness 	 	that	i	can	even	think	of	.
even	when	the	japanese	 bomb 	 ed 	 	pearl	harbor	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	they	shot	back	.
and	we	just	seem	to	be	 un 	 able 	 	to	figure	out	what	to	do	.
there	was	 noth 	 ing 	 	ready	,
and	,	you	know	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	can	see	by	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	.	 main 	 ly 	 	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	is	 boom 	 s 	 	and	 dispers 	 ants 	 	.
the	 boom 	 s 	 	are	 absolute 	 ly 	 	not	made	for	open	water	.
they	do	n't	even	attempt	to	corral	the	oil	where	it	is	most	 concent 	 rated 	 	.
they	get	near	shore	.	look	at	these	two	 boat 	 s 	 	.
that	one	on	the	right	is	 call 	 ed 	 	 fish 	 ing 	 	fool	.
and	i	think	,	you	know	,	that	's	a	great	name	for	 boat 	 s 	 	that	think	that	they	're	going	to	do	 any 	 thing 	 	to	make	a	dent	in	 th 	 is 	 	by	 drag 	 ging 	 	a	boom	between	them	when	there	are	 liter 	 ally 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	square	 mile 	 s 	 	in	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	right	now	with	oil	at	the	surface	.
the	 dispers 	 ants 	 	make	the	oil	go	right	under	the	 boom 	 s 	 	.
the	 boom 	 s 	 	are	 on 	 ly 	 	about	13	 inch 	 es 	 	in	 dia 	 meter 	 	.
so	it	's	just	 absolute 	 ly 	 	crazy	.
here	are	shrimp	 boat 	 s 	 	 employ 	 ed 	 	.
there	are	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	shrimp	 boat 	 s 	 	 employ 	 ed 	 	to	drag	 boom 	 s 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 net 	 s 	 	.
here	they	are	 work 	 ing 	 	.
you	can	see	 eas 	 ily 	 	that	all	the	 oil 	 y 	 	water	just	 go 	 es 	 	over	the	back	of	the	boom	.
all	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	is	 stir 	 ring 	 	it	.
it	's	just	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	.
 al 	 so 	 	,	for	all	the	 shore 	 line 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 boom 	 s 	 	--	 hundred 	 s 	 	and	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 mile 	 s 	 	of	 shore 	 line 	 	--	all	of	the	 shore 	 line 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 boom 	 s 	 	,	there	's	 ad 	 ja 	 cent 	 	 shore 	 line 	 	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	any	 boom 	 s 	 	.
there	is	ample	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	for	oil	and	 dirt 	 y 	 	water	to	get	in	 be 	 hind 	 	them	.
and	that	lower	photo	,	that	's	a	bird	 colon 	 y 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 boom 	 ed 	 	.
 every 	 body 	 	's	 try 	 ing 	 	to	protect	the	bird	 colon 	 ies 	 	there	.
well	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	 ornitho 	 logist 	 	,	i	can	tell	you	that	 bird 	 s 	 	fly	,	and	that	--	and	that	 boom 	 ing 	 	a	bird	 colon 	 y 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	do	it	;	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	do	it	.
these	 bird 	 s 	 	make	a	living	by	 div 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	water	.
in	fact	,	 re 	 ally 	 	what	i	think	they	should	do	,	if	 any 	 thing 	 	--	they	're	 try 	 ing 	 	so	hard	to	protect	 t 	 hose 	 	 nest 	 s 	 	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	if	they	 destroy 	 ed 	 	every	single	nest	some	of	the	 bird 	 s 	 	would	 leav 	 e 	 	,	and	that	would	be	better	for	them	 th 	 is 	 	year	.
 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	 clean 	 ing 	 	them	,	i	do	n't	mean	to	cast	any	 aspers 	 ion 	 	on	people	 clean 	 ing 	 	 bird 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	that	we	express	our	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
i	think	that	's	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	that	people	have	,	is	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	get	 t 	 hose 	 	 image 	 s 	 	and	to	show	it	.
but	 re 	 ally 	 	,	where	are	 t 	 hose 	 	 bird 	 s 	 	going	to	get	released	to	?
it	's	like	taking	 some 	 body 	 	out	of	a	 burn 	 ing 	 	building	,	 treat 	 ing 	 	them	for	smoke	 inhal 	 ation 	 	and	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	them	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	building	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	oil	is	still	 gush 	 ing 	 	.
i	 re 	 fuse 	 	to	 acknowledg 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	like	an	accident	.
i	think	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	result	of	gross	 neglig 	 ence 	 	.
not	just	b.p	.
b.p	.	 oper 	 ated 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 slop 	 pi 	 ly 	 	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 reckless 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	could	.
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	do	so	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	absolute	failure	of	 over 	 sight 	 	of	the	government	that	's	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	our	government	,	 protect 	 ing 	 	us	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	--	you	see	 th 	 is 	 	sign	on	 al 	 most 	 	every	commercial	vessel	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	--	you	know	,	if	you	 s 	 pill 	 ed 	 	a	couple	of	 gallon 	 s 	 	of	oil	,	you	would	be	in	big	trouble	.
and	you	have	to	 re 	 ally 	 	wonder	who	are	the	 law 	 s 	 	made	for	,	and	who	 ha 	 s 	 	gotten	above	the	 law 	 s 	 	.
now	there	are	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	can	do	in	the	future	.
we	could	have	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	that	we	would	 re 	 ally 	 	need	.
it	would	not	take	an	awful	lot	to	 anticip 	 ate 	 	that	after	making	30,000	 hole 	 s 	 	in	the	sea	floor	of	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	of	mexico	looking	for	oil	,	oil	might	start	coming	out	of	one	of	them	.
and	you	'd	have	some	idea	of	what	to	do	.
that	's	 certain 	 ly 	 	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	need	to	do	.
but	i	think	we	have	to	understand	where	 th 	 is 	 	leak	 re 	 ally 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	from	.
it	 re 	 ally 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	from	the	 destruct 	 ion 	 	of	the	idea	that	the	government	is	there	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	our	government	,	 me 	 ant 	 	to	protect	the	 large 	 r 	 	public	interest	.
so	i	think	that	the	oil	 blow 	 out 	 	,	the	bank	 bail 	 out 	 	,	the	mortgage	crisis	and	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 symptom 	 s 	 	of	the	same	cause	.
we	still	seem	to	understand	that	at	 l 	 east 	 	we	need	the	police	to	protect	us	from	a	few	bad	people	.
and	even	 th 	 ough 	 	the	police	can	be	a	little	 annoy 	 ing 	 	at	 time 	 s 	 	--	giving	us	 ticket 	 s 	 	and	stuff	like	that	--	 no 	 body 	 	 say 	 s 	 	that	we	should	just	get	rid	of	them	.
but	in	the	entire	rest	of	government	right	now	and	for	the	last	at	 l 	 east 	 	30	 year 	 s 	 	,	there	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	culture	of	 de 	 regulat 	 ion 	 	that	is	 caus 	 ed 	 	 direct 	 ly 	 	by	the	people	who	we	need	to	be	 protect 	 ed 	 	from	,	 buy 	 ing 	 	the	government	out	from	under	us	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	problem	for	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	long	time	.
you	can	see	that	 corporation 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 il 	 legal 	 	at	the	 found 	 ing 	 	of	america	,
and	even	thomas	jefferson	 complain 	 ed 	 	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	 bid 	 d 	 ing 	 	 defi 	 ance 	 	to	the	 law 	 s 	 	of	our	country	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	people	who	say	they	're	 conserv 	 ative 	 	,	if	they	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	 re 	 ally 	 	 conserv 	 ative 	 	and	 re 	 ally 	 	 patriot 	 ic 	 	,	they	would	tell	these	 corporation 	 s 	 	to	go	to	hell	.
that	's	what	it	would	 re 	 ally 	 	mean	to	be	 conserv 	 ative 	 	.
so	what	we	 re 	 ally 	 	need	to	do	is	regain	the	idea	that	it	's	our	government	 safe 	 guard 	 ing 	 	our	 interest 	 s 	 
and	regain	a	sense	of	 un 	 ity 	 	and	common	cause	in	our	country	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	lost	.
i	think	there	are	 sign 	 s 	 	of	hope	.
we	seem	to	be	 wa 	 king 	 	up	a	little	bit	.
the	glass	-	steagall	act	--	which	was	 re 	 ally 	 	to	protect	us	from	the	kind	of	thing	that	 caus 	 ed 	 	the	 recess 	 ion 	 	to	happen	,	and	the	bank	 melt 	 down 	 	and	all	that	stuff	that	 requir 	 ed 	 	the	 bail 	 out 	 s 	 	--	that	was	put	in	effect	in	1933	,	was	 system 	 at 	 ically 	 	 destroy 	 ed 	 	.
back	in	place	,
but	the	 lobby 	 ists 	 	are	 al 	 ready 	 	there	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 weak 	 en 	 	the	 regulat 	 ions 	 	after	the	 legisl 	 ation 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	just	 pass 	 ed 	 	.
so	it	's	a	 continu 	 ed 	 	fight	.
it	's	a	historic	moment	right	now	.
we	're	either	going	to	have	an	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 un 	 mitig 	 ated 	 	 catastroph 	 e 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	oil	leak	in	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	,	or	we	will	make	the	moment	we	need	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	have	 not 	 ed 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
there	's	 certain 	 ly 	 	a	common	theme	about	 need 	 ing 	 	to	make	the	moment	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
we	've	 be 	 en 	 	through	 th 	 is 	 	before	with	other	ways	of	 off 	 shore 	 	 drill 	 ing 	 	.
the	first	 off 	 shore 	 	 well 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 whale 	 s 	 	.
the	first	 off 	 shore 	 	 drill 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 har 	 poons 	 	.
we	 empti 	 ed 	 	the	ocean	of	the	 whale 	 s 	 	at	that	time	.
now	are	we	 s 	 tuck 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	?
ever	since	we	lived	in	 cave 	 s 	 	,	every	time	we	 want 	 ed 	 	any	energy	,	we	lit	 some 	 thing 	 	on	fire	,	and	that	is	still	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	.	we	're	still	 light 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	on	fire	every	time	we	want	energy	.
and	people	say	we	ca	n't	have	clean	energy	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	too	expensive	.
who	 say 	 s 	 	it	's	too	expensive	?
people	who	sell	us	fossil	 fuel 	 s 	 	.
we	've	 be 	 en 	 	here	before	with	energy	,	and	people	 say 	 ing 	 	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	can	not	 with 	 stand 	 	a	 s 	 witch 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 cheap 	 est 	 	energy	was	 slave 	 ry 	 	.
energy	is	 al 	 ways 	 	a	moral	issue	.
it	's	an	issue	that	is	moral	right	now	.
it	's	a	matter	of	right	and	wrong	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
