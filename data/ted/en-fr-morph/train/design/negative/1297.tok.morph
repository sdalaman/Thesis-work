over	the	last	13	 year 	 s 	 	--	one	,	three	,	13	 year 	 s 	 	--	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	part	of	an	 exception 	 al 	 	team	at	insightec	in	israel	and	 partner 	 s 	 	around	the	world	for	taking	 th 	 is 	 	idea	,	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 cept 	 	,	noninvasive	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	,	from	the	research	lab	to	routine	 clinic 	 al 	 	use	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	'll	tell	you	about	.
13	 year 	 s 	 	--	for	some	of	you	,	you	can	 empath 	 ize 	 	with	that	number	.
for	me	,	 to 	 day 	 	,	on	 th 	 is 	 	date	,	it	's	like	a	second	bar	mitzvah	experience	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	dream	is	 re 	 ally 	 	enabled	by	the	 converg 	 ence 	 	of	two	known	 techno 	 logies 	 	.
one	is	the	focused	 ultra 	 sound 	 	,	and	the	other	one	is	the	vision	-	enabled	 magnet 	 ic 	 	 reson 	 ance 	 	 im 	 aging 	 	.
so	let	's	first	talk	about	focused	 ultra 	 sound 	 	.
and	i	hold	in	my	hand	a	tissue	-	 mimic 	 king 	 	phantom	.
it	is	made	out	of	silicon	.
it	is	 trans 	 parent 	 	,	made	just	for	you	.
so	you	see	,	it	's	all	 in 	 tact 	 	,	 complete 	 ly 	 	 trans 	 parent 	 	.
i	'll	take	you	now	to	the	acoustic	lab	.
you	see	the	phantom	 with 	 in 	 	the	 aqua 	 rium 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 set 	 up 	 	i	put	in	a	physics	lab	.
on	the	right	-	hand	side	,	you	see	an	ultrasonic	transducer	.
so	the	ultrasonic	transducer	 emit 	 s 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	an	ultrasonic	beam	that	 focus 	 es 	 	 in 	 side 	 	the	phantom	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	when	you	hear	the	click	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	when	the	energy	 start 	 s 	 	to	emit	and	you	see	a	little	 les 	 ion 	 	form	 in 	 side 	 	the	phantom	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	 every 	 thing 	 	around	it	is	whole	and	 in 	 tact 	 	.
it	's	just	a	 les 	 ion 	 	 form 	 ed 	 	 in 	 side 	 	.
so	think	about	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	in	your	brain	.
we	need	to	reach	a	target	 in 	 side 	 	the	brain	.
we	can	do	it	 with 	 out 	 	 harm 	 ing 	 	any	tissue	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	i	think	,	the	first	kosher	hippocratic	 sur 	 gical 	 	system	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	let	's	talk	a	little	bit	about	 ultra 	 sound 	 	,	the	force	of	 ultra 	 sound 	 	.
you	know	all	about	 im 	 aging 	 	,	right	,	 ultra 	 sound 	 	 im 	 aging 	 	.
and	you	know	 al 	 so 	 	about	lithotripsy	--	 break 	 ing 	 	 kid 	 ney 	 	 stone 	 s 	 	.
but	 ultra 	 sound 	 	can	be	shaped	to	be	 any 	 thing 	 	in	between	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	a	 mechanic 	 al 	 	force	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	,	it	's	a	force	 act 	 ing 	 	on	a	tissue	that	it	transverses	.
so	you	can	change	the	 intens 	 ity 	 	,	the	frequency	,	the	 dur 	 ation 	 	,	the	 puls 	 e 	 	shape	of	the	 ultra 	 sound 	 	to	create	 any 	 thing 	 	from	an	 air 	 brush 	 	to	a	hammer	.
and	i	am	going	to	show	you	 multi 	 ple 	 	 application 	 s 	 	in	the	medical	field	that	can	be	enabled	just	by	 focus 	 ing 	 	,	 physical 	 ly 	 	 focus 	 ing 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	 harness 	 ing 	 	focused	 ultra 	 sound 	 	to	treat	 les 	 ions 	 	in	the	brain	is	not	new	at	all	.
when	i	was	born	,	 th 	 is 	 	idea	was	 al 	 ready 	 	 conceiv 	 ed 	 	by	 pioneer 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	fry	 brother 	 s 	 	and	lars	leksell	,	who	is	know	 actual 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	inventor	of	the	gammaknife	.
but	you	may	not	know	that	he	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	perform	lobotomies	in	the	brain	,	noninvasively	,	with	focused	 ultra 	 sound 	 	in	the	'50s	.
he	 fail 	 ed 	 	,	so	he	then	 invent 	 ed 	 	the	gammaknife	.
and	it	 make 	 s 	 	you	ponder	why	 t 	 hose 	 	 pioneer 	 s 	 	 fail 	 ed 	 	.
and	there	was	 some 	 thing 	 	fundamental	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	the	vision	.
it	was	n't	 un 	 til 	 	the	 invent 	 ion 	 	of	the	mr	and	 re 	 ally 	 	the	 integ 	 ration 	 	of	mr	with	focused	 ultra 	 sound 	 	that	we	could	get	the	 feed 	 back 	 	--	both	the	 an 	 atomic 	 al 	 	and	the	 physiologic 	 al 	 	in	order	to	have	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	noninvasive	,	closed	-	loop	 sur 	 gical 	 	procedure	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	it	 look 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	the	 oper 	 ating 	 	room	of	the	future	 to 	 day 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	mr	 suit 	 e 	 	with	a	focused	 ultra 	 sound 	 	system	.
and	i	will	give	you	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
so	the	first	one	is	in	the	brain	.
one	of	the	 neuro 	 logical 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	that	can	be	 treat 	 ed 	 	with	focused	 ultra 	 sound 	 	are	 move 	 ment 	 	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	,	like	parkinson	's	or	essential	 trem 	 or 	 	.
what	is	typical	to	 t 	 hose 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	,	to	essential	 trem 	 or 	 	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	is	 in 	 ability 	 	to	drink	or	eat	 ce 	 real 	 	or	soup	 with 	 out 	 	 s 	 pill 	 ing 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	all	over	you	,	or	write	 leg 	 ibly 	 	so	people	can	understand	it	,	and	be	 re 	 ally 	 	 in 	 dependent 	 	in	your	life	 with 	 out 	 	the	help	of	 other 	 s 	 	.
so	i	'd	like	you	to	meet	john	.
john	is	a	 retire 	 d 	 	professor	of	 histo 	 ry 	 	from	virginia	.
so	he	 suffer 	 ed 	 	from	essential	 trem 	 or 	 	for	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	 medic 	 ation 	 	did	n't	help	him	 any 	 more 	 	.
and	 man 	 y 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 patient 	 s 	 	 re 	 fused 	 	to	 under 	 go 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	to	have	people	cut	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	brain	.
and	about	four	or	five	 month 	 s 	 	ago	,	he	 under 	 went 	 	an	 experiment 	 al 	 	procedure	.
it	is	approved	under	an	fdaide	at	the	university	of	virginia	in	charlottesville
using	focused	 ultra 	 sound 	 	to	ablate	a	point	in	his	thalamus	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	his	 hand 	 writing 	 	.
``	on	june	20th	,	``	if	you	can	read	it	,	``	2011	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	his	 hand 	 writing 	 	on	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	of	the	 treat 	 ment 	 	before	going	 in 	 to 	 	the	mr
so	now	i	'll	take	you	through	[	what	]	a	typical	procedure	like	that	 look 	 s 	 	like	,	[	what	]	noninvasive	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
so	we	put	the	patient	on	the	mr	table	.
we	attach	a	transducer	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	to	the	brain	,	but	if	it	will	be	a	different	organ	,	it	will	be	a	different	transducer	 attach 	 ed 	 	to	the	patient	.
and	the	physician	will	then	take	a	regular	mr	 s 	 can 	 	.
and	the	 object 	 ive 	 	of	that	?
i	do	n't	have	a	 point 	 er 	 	here	,	but	you	see	the	green	,	sort	of	 rect 	 angle 	 	or	trapezoid	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	sort	of	general	area	of	the	 treat 	 ment 	 	.
it	's	a	 safe 	 ty 	 	 bound 	 ary 	 	around	the	target	.
it	's	a	target	in	the	thalamus	.
so	once	 t 	 hose 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	are	 acquir 	 ed 	 	and	the	physician	 ha 	 s 	 	drawn	all	the	 necess 	 ary 	 	 safe 	 ty 	 	 limit 	 s 	 	and	so	on	,	he	 select 	 s 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	a	point	--	you	see	the	round	point	in	the	middle	where	the	cursor	is	--	and	he	 press 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	blue	button	 call 	 ed 	 	``	sonicate	.	``
we	call	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 stance 	 	of	 inject 	 ing 	 	the	energy	,	the	 on 	 ly 	 	handwork	the	physician	 do 	 es 	 	here	is	moving	a	mouse	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	he	 need 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 treat 	 ment 	 	.
so	he	 press 	 es 	 	``	sonicate	,	``	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 happen 	 s 	 	.
you	see	the	transducer	,	the	light	blue	.
there	's	water	in	between	the	skull	and	the	transducer	.
and	it	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	burst	of	energy	.
it	 elev 	 ates 	 	the	temperature	.
we	first	need	to	 ver 	 ify 	 	that	we	are	on	target	.
so	the	first	sonication	is	at	lower	energy	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	do	any	damage	,	but	it	 elev 	 ates 	 	the	temperature	by	a	few	 degree 	 s 	 	.
and	one	of	the	 un 	 ique 	 	 cap 	 abilities 	 	that	we	leverage	with	the	mr	is	the	ability	to	measure	temperature	noninvasively	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	a	 un 	 ique 	 	 cap 	 ability 	 	of	the	mr	.
it	is	not	 be 	 ing 	 	used	in	regular	 diagnos 	 tic 	 	 im 	 aging 	 	.
but	here	we	can	get	both	the	 an 	 atomic 	 al 	 	 im 	 aging 	 	and	the	temperature	 map 	 s 	 	in	real	time	.
and	you	can	see	the	 point 	 s 	 	there	on	the	graph	.
the	temperature	was	raised	to	43	 degree 	 s 	 	c	 tempor 	 arily 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	cause	any	damage	.
but	the	point	is	we	are	right	on	target	.
so	once	the	physician	verifies	that	the	focus	spot	is	on	the	target	he	 ha 	 s 	 	 chose 	 n 	 	,	then	we	move	to	perform	a	full	-	energy	ablation	like	you	see	here	.
and	you	see	the	temperature	 rise 	 s 	 	to	like	55	to	60	 degree 	 s 	 	c	.
if	you	do	it	for	more	than	a	second	,	it	's	 en 	 ough 	 	to	 bas 	 ically 	 	destroy	the	 protein 	 s 	 	of	the	 cell 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 out 	 come 	 	from	a	patient	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	--	same	day	after	the	 treat 	 ment 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 im 	 mediate 	 	relief	.
thank	you	.
john	is	one	of	[	about	]	a	dozen	 ver 	 y 	 	 hero 	 ic 	 	,	 courage 	 ous 	 	people	who	 volunteer 	 ed 	 	for	the	 stud 	 y 	 	.
and	you	have	to	understand	what	is	in	people	's	mind	when	they	are	 will 	 ing 	 	to	take	the	risk	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	quote	from	john	after	he	wrote	it	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 miracul 	 ous 	 	.	``
and	his	wife	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 hap 	 pies 	 t 	 	moment	of	my	life	.	``
and	you	wonder	why	.
i	mean	,	one	of	the	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	i	like	to	carry	over	is	,	what	about	 defend 	 ing 	 	quality	of	life	?
i	mean	,	 t 	 hose 	 	people	lose	 the 	 ir 	 	 in 	 depend 	 ence 	 	.
they	are	dependent	on	 other 	 s 	 	.
and	john	 to 	 day 	 	is	fully	 in 	 dependent 	 	.
he	 return 	 ed 	 	to	a	normal	life	routine	.
and	he	 al 	 so 	 	 play 	 s 	 	golf	,	like	you	do	in	virginia	when	you	are	 retire 	 d 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	you	can	see	here	the	spot	.
it	's	like	three	 millimeter 	 s 	 	in	the	middle	of	the	brain	.
there	's	no	damage	 out 	 side 	 	.
he	 suffer 	 s 	 	from	no	neurodeficit	.
there	's	no	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	,	no	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
he	's	back	to	his	normal	life	.
let	's	move	now	to	a	more	 pain 	 ful 	 	subject	.
pain	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	can	make	your	life	 mis 	 er 	 able 	 	.
and	people	are	 suffer 	 ing 	 	from	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	pain	like	neuropathic	pain	,	lower	-	back	pain	and	cancer	pain	from	bone	 metasta 	 s 	 es 	 	,	when	the	 metasta 	 s 	 es 	 	get	to	your	 bone 	 s 	 	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	they	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 pain 	 ful 	 	.
all	 t 	 hose 	 	i	've	 indic 	 ated 	 	have	 al 	 ready 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 show 	 n 	 	to	be	 success 	 fully 	 	 treat 	 ed 	 	by	focused	 ultra 	 sound 	 	 reliev 	 ing 	 	the	pain	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	fast	.
and	i	would	like	to	tell	you	about	pj	.
he	's	a	78	year	-	old	 farm 	 er 	 	who	 suffer 	 ed 	 	from	--	how	should	i	say	it	?	--	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	pain	in	the	butt	.
he	had	 metasta 	 s 	 es 	 	in	his	right	buttock	,	and	he	could	n't	 s 	 it 	 	even	with	 medic 	 ation 	 	.
he	had	to	 for 	 go 	 	all	the	farm	 activ 	 ities 	 	.
he	was	 treat 	 ed 	 	with	 radi 	 ation 	 	therapy	,	state	-	of	-	the	-	art	 radi 	 ation 	 	therapy	,	but	it	did	n't	help	.
 man 	 y 	 	 patient 	 s 	 	like	that	favor	 radi 	 ation 	 	therapy	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	he	 volunteer 	 ed 	 	to	a	 pivot 	 al 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	that	we	ran	 world 	 wide 	 	,	 al 	 so 	 	in	the	u.s.	and	his	wife	 actual 	 ly 	 	took	him	.
they	drove	like	three	 hour 	 s 	 	from	 the 	 ir 	 	farm	to	the	hospital	.
he	had	to	 s 	 it 	 	on	a	cushion	,	stand	still	,	not	move	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 pain 	 ful 	 	.
he	took	the	 treat 	 ment 	 	,	and	on	the	way	back	,	he	drove	the	truck	by	 him 	 self 	 	.
so	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 im 	 mediate 	 	relief	.
and	you	have	to	understand	what	 t 	 hose 	 	people	feel	and	what	 the 	 ir 	 	family	 experience 	 s 	 	when	it	 happen 	 s 	 	.
he	 return 	 ed 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	to	his	 dai 	 ly 	 	routine	on	the	farm	.
he	 ride 	 s 	 	his	 tract 	 or 	 	.
he	 ride 	 s 	 	his	horse	to	 the 	 ir 	 	mountain	 cab 	 in 	 	 regular 	 ly 	 	.
and	he	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	.
but	now	,	you	ask	me	,	but	what	about	war	,	the	war	on	cancer	?
show	us	some	 prim 	 ary 	 	cancer	.
what	can	be	 d 	 one 	 	there	?
so	i	have	good	news	and	bad	news	.
the	good	news	:	there	's	a	lot	that	can	be	 d 	 one 	 	.
and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 show 	 n 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 out 	 side 	 	of	the	u.s	.
and	 do 	 ing 	 	that	in	the	u.s.	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 pain 	 ful 	 	.
i	do	n't	see	,	 with 	 out 	 	 th 	 is 	 	nation	taking	it	 a 	 s 	 	some	 collect 	 ive 	 	will	or	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	a	national	goal	to	make	that	happen	,	it	will	not	happen	.
and	it	's	not	just	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 regulat 	 ion 	 	;	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	amount	of	money	 need 	 ed 	 	under	the	current	evidence	-	based	medicine	and	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	 trial 	 s 	 	and	so	on
to	make	it	happen	.
so	the	first	two	 application 	 s 	 	are	breast	cancer	and	 pro 	 state 	 	cancer	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	the	first	to	be	 treat 	 ed 	 	by	focused	 ultra 	 sound 	 	.
and	we	have	better	-	than	-	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	 result 	 s 	 	in	 breast 	 s 	 	.
but	i	have	a	 mess 	 age 	 	for	the	men	here	.
we	heard	here	 yester 	 day 	 	quyen	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	 advers 	 e 	 	event	trait	in	 pro 	 state 	 	cancer	.
there	is	a	 un 	 ique 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	now	with	focused	 ultra 	 sound 	 	 guide 	 d 	 	by	mr	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	think	about	 pro 	 state 	 	 lump 	 ectomy 	 	--	 treat 	 ing 	 	just	the	 f 	 oc 	 al 	 	 les 	 ion 	 	and	not	 re 	 moving 	 	the	whole	 g 	 land 	 	,	and	by	that	,	 avoid 	 ing 	 	all	the	 issue 	 s 	 	with	 pot 	 ency 	 	and	incontinence	.
well	,	there	are	other	cancer	 tumor 	 s 	 	in	the	abdomen	--	 quit 	 e 	 	lethal	,	 ver 	 y 	 	lethal	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	 pan 	 cre 	 a 	 s 	 	,	liver	,	 kid 	 ney 	 	.
the	 challeng 	 e 	 	there	with	a	 breath 	 ing 	 	and	awake	patient	--	and	in	all	our	 treat 	 ments 	 	,	the	patient	is	awake	and	conscious	and	 speak 	 s 	 	with	the	physician	--	is	you	have	to	teach	the	mr	some	 trick 	 s 	 	how	to	do	it	in	real	time	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	will	take	time	.
 th 	 is 	 	will	take	two	 year 	 s 	 	.
but	i	have	now	a	 mess 	 age 	 	to	the	 lad 	 ies 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	in	2004	,	the	fda	 ha 	 s 	 	approved	mr	-	 guide 	 d 	 	focused	 ultra 	 sound 	 s 	 	for	the	 treat 	 ment 	 	of	 symptom 	 atic 	 	uterine	fibroids	.
women	suffer	from	that	disease	.
all	 t 	 hose 	 	 tumor 	 s 	 	have	heavy	 ble 	 ed 	 ing 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	 period 	 s 	 	,	abdominal	pressure	,	back	pain	,	frequent	urination	.
and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	they	can	not	even	 conceiv 	 e 	 	and	 be 	 come 	 	 pregn 	 ant 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	fibroid	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	frances	.
she	was	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	with	a	 grape 	 fruit 	 	-	sized	fibroid	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	big	fibroid	.
she	was	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	a	 hyster 	 ectomy 	 	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 in 	 conceiv 	 able 	 	 pro 	 position 	 	for	 some 	 one 	 	who	 want 	 s 	 	to	keep	her	 pregn 	 ancy 	 	option	.
so	she	 elect 	 ed 	 	to	 under 	 go 	 	a	focused	 ultra 	 sound 	 	procedure	in	2008	.
and	in	2010	,	she	 be 	 came 	 	a	first	-	time	mother	to	a	 health 	 y 	 	baby	.
so	new	life	was	born	.
so	in	 con 	 clusion 	 	,	i	'd	like	to	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	 actual 	 ly 	 	four	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	.
one	is	,	think	about	the	amount	of	 suffer 	 ing 	 	that	is	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	from	 patient 	 s 	 	 under 	 going 	 	noninvasive	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	the	 economic 	 al 	 	and	 emotion 	 al 	 	burden	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	and	 commun 	 ities 	 	and	the	 socie 	 ty 	 	at	large	--	and	i	think	 al 	 so 	 	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 physician 	 s 	 	,	by	the	way	.
and	the	other	thing	i	would	like	you	to	think	about	is	the	new	type	of	relationship	between	physician	and	 patient 	 s 	 
when	you	have	a	patient	on	the	table	[	who	]	is	awake	and	can	even	monitor	the	 treat 	 ment 	 	.
in	all	our	 treat 	 ments 	 	,	the	patient	 hold 	 s 	 	a	stop	sonication	button	.
he	can	stop	the	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	at	any	moment	.
and	with	that	note	,	i	would	like	to	thank	you	for	 listen 	 ing 	 	.
