philip	zimbardo	:	let	's	tune	 in 	 to 	 	the	conversation	of	the	 principal 	 s 	 	in	adam	's	 tempt 	 ation 	 	.
``	come	on	adam	,	do	n't	be	so	wishy	-	washy	.	take	a	bite	.	``	``	i	did	.	``
``	one	bite	,	adam	.	do	n't	abandon	eve	.	``
``	i	do	n't	know	,	 guy 	 s 	 	.
i	do	n't	want	to	get	in	trouble	.	``
``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	one	bite	.	what	the	hell	?	``
life	is	 tempt 	 ation 	 	.	it	's	all	about	 yield 	 ing 	 	,	 resist 	 ing 	 	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	no	,	now	,	 lat 	 er 	 	,	 im 	 puls 	 ive 	 	,	 reflect 	 ive 	 	,	present	focus	and	future	focus	.
 promise 	 d 	 	 virtue 	 s 	 	fall	 pre 	 y 	 	to	the	 pass 	 ions 	 	of	the	moment	.
of	 teen 	 age 	 	 girl 	 s 	 	who	 pledg 	 ed 	 	sexual	 ab 	 s 	 tin 	 ence 	 	and	 virgin 	 ity 	 	 un 	 til 	 	marriage	--	thank	you	george	bush	--	the	 major 	 ity 	 	,	60	percent	,	 yield 	 ed 	 	to	sexual	 tempt 	 ations 	 	 with 	 in 	 	one	year	.
and	most	of	them	did	so	 with 	 out 	 	using	birth	control	.
so	much	for	 promise 	 s 	 	.
now	lets	tempt	four	-	year	-	olds	,	giving	them	a	treat	.
they	can	have	one	 marsh 	 mal 	 low 	 	now	.	but	if	they	wait	 un 	 til 	 	the	 experiment 	 er 	 	 come 	 s 	 	back	,	they	can	have	two	.
of	course	it	 pay 	 s 	 	,	if	you	like	 marsh 	 mal 	 low 	 s 	 	,	to	wait	.
what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	two	-	 third 	 s 	 	of	the	 kid 	 s 	 	give	in	to	 tempt 	 ation 	 	.
they	can	not	wait	.	the	 other 	 s 	 	,	of	course	,	wait	.
they	resist	the	 tempt 	 ation 	 	.	they	delay	the	now	for	 lat 	 er 	 	.
walter	mischel	,	my	 col 	 league 	 	at	stanford	,	went	back	14	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	to	try	to	discover	what	was	different	about	 t 	 hose 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	enormous	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	between	 kid 	 s 	 	who	 resist 	 ed 	 	and	 kid 	 s 	 	who	 yield 	 ed 	 	,	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	.
the	 kid 	 s 	 	who	 resist 	 ed 	 	 score 	 d 	 	250	 point 	 s 	 	 high 	 er 	 	on	the	 s 	 at 	 	.
that	's	enormous	.	that	's	like	a	whole	set	of	different	iq	 point 	 s 	 	.
they	did	n't	get	in	 a 	 s 	 	much	trouble	.	they	 we 	 re 	 	better	 student 	 s 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	self	-	confident	and	 determine 	 d 	 	.	and	the	key	for	me	 to 	 day 	 	,	the	key	for	you	,	is	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	future	-	focused	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	present	-	focused	.
so	what	is	time	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	?	that	's	what	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	 to 	 day 	 	.
time	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	is	the	 stud 	 y 	 	of	how	 individual 	 s 	 	,	all	of	us	,	divide	the	flow	of	your	human	experience	 in 	 to 	 	time	 zone 	 s 	 	or	time	 categor 	 ies 	 	.
and	you	do	it	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	and	non	-	 conscious 	 ly 	 	.
they	vary	between	 culture 	 s 	 	,	between	 nation 	 s 	 	,	between	 individual 	 s 	 	,	between	social	 class 	 es 	 	,	between	education	 level 	 s 	 	.
and	the	problem	is	that	they	can	 be 	 come 	 	 bias 	 ed 	 	,
 be 	 cause 	 	you	learn	to	over	-	use	some	of	them	and	under	-	use	the	 other 	 s 	 	.
what	 determine 	 s 	 	any	decision	you	make	?
you	make	a	decision	on	which	you	're	going	to	base	an	action	.
for	some	people	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	about	what	is	in	the	 im 	 mediate 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	what	other	people	are	 do 	 ing 	 	and	what	you	're	 feel 	 ing 	 	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	people	,	when	they	make	 the 	 ir 	 	 decision 	 s 	 	in	that	format	--	we	're	going	to	call	them	``	present	-	oriented	,	``
 be 	 cause 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	focus	is	what	is	now	.
for	 other 	 s 	 	,	the	present	is	 ir 	 relevant 	 	.
it	's	 al 	 ways 	 	about	``	what	is	 th 	 is 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	like	that	i	've	 experience 	 d 	 	in	the	past	?	``
so	that	 the 	 ir 	 	 decision 	 s 	 	are	based	on	past	 memor 	 ies 	 	.
and	we	're	going	to	call	 t 	 hose 	 	people	``	past	-	oriented	,	``	 be 	 cause 	 	they	focus	on	what	was	.
for	 other 	 s 	 	it	's	not	the	past	,	it	's	not	the	present	,	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	about	the	future	.
 the 	 ir 	 	focus	is	 al 	 ways 	 	about	 anticip 	 ated 	 	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	.
cost	-	benefit	analysis	.
we	're	going	to	call	them	``	future	-	oriented	.	``	 the 	 ir 	 	focus	is	on	what	will	be	.
so	,	time	paradox	,	i	want	to	 argu 	 e 	 	,	the	paradox	of	time	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 influence 	 s 	 	every	decision	you	make	,	you	're	 total 	 ly 	 	 un 	 aware 	 	of	.
 name 	 ly 	 	,	the	 ex 	 tent 	 	to	which	you	have	one	of	these	 bias 	 ed 	 	time	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 s 	 	.
well	there	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	six	of	them	.	there	are	two	ways	to	be	present	-	oriented	.
there	is	two	ways	to	be	past	-	oriented	,	two	ways	to	be	future	.
you	can	focus	on	past	-	positive	,	or	past	-	negative	.
you	can	be	present	-	 hedon 	 istic 	 	,	 name 	 ly 	 	you	focus	on	the	 joy 	 s 	 	of	life	,	or	present	-	fatalist	--
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	,	your	life	is	controlled	.
you	can	be	future	-	oriented	,	setting	 goal 	 s 	 	.
or	you	can	be	 transcend 	 ent 	 al 	 	future	:	 name 	 ly 	 	,	life	 begin 	 s 	 	after	death	.
 develop 	 ing 	 	the	mental	 flex 	 ibility 	 	to	shift	time	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 s 	 	 fluid 	 ly 	 	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	the	 demand 	 s 	 	of	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	that	's	what	you	've	got	to	learn	to	do	.
so	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	what	is	the	optimal	time	profile	?
high	on	past	-	positive	.	 moderate 	 ly 	 	high	on	future	.
and	moderate	on	present	-	 hedon 	 ism 	 	.
and	 al 	 ways 	 	low	on	past	-	negative	and	present	-	 fatal 	 ism 	 	.
so	the	optimal	temporal	mix	is	what	you	get	from	the	past	--	past	-	positive	 give 	 s 	 	you	 root 	 s 	 	.	you	connect	your	family	,	 ident 	 ity 	 	and	your	self	.
what	you	get	from	the	future	is	 wing 	 s 	 	to	soar	to	new	 destination 	 s 	 	,	new	 challeng 	 es 	 	.
what	you	get	from	the	present	 hedon 	 ism 	 	is	the	energy	,	the	energy	to	explore	 your 	 self 	 	,	 place 	 s 	 	,	people	,	 sensual 	 ity 	 	.
any	time	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	in	excess	 ha 	 s 	 	more	 negative 	 s 	 	than	 positive 	 s 	 	.
what	do	 future 	 s 	 	sacrifice	for	success	?
they	sacrifice	family	time	.	they	sacrifice	friend	time	.
they	sacrifice	 f 	 un 	 	time	.	they	sacrifice	personal	 indulge 	 nce 	 	.
they	sacrifice	 hob 	 bie 	 s 	 	.	and	they	sacrifice	sleep	.	so	it	 affect 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	health	.
and	they	live	for	work	,	 achiev 	 ement 	 	and	control	.
i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	that	 reson 	 ates 	 	with	some	of	the	tedsters	.
and	it	 reson 	 ated 	 	for	me	.	i	grew	up	 a 	 s 	 	a	poor	kid	in	the	south	bronx	ghetto	,	a	sicilian	family	--	 every 	 one 	 	lived	in	the	past	and	present	.
i	'm	here	 a 	 s 	 	a	future	-	oriented	person	who	went	over	the	top	,	who	did	all	these	 sacrifice 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 teacher 	 s 	 	 inter 	 vene 	 d 	 	,	and	made	me	future	oriented	.
told	me	do	n't	eat	that	 marsh 	 mal 	 low 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	wait	you	're	going	to	get	two	of	them	,	 un 	 til 	 	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	to	balance	out	.
i	've	 add 	 ed 	 	present	-	 hedon 	 ism 	 	,	i	've	 add 	 ed 	 	a	focus	on	the	past	-	positive	,
so	,	at	76	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	i	am	more	 energ 	 etic 	 	than	ever	,	more	productive	,	and	i	'm	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	than	i	have	ever	 be 	 en 	 	.
i	just	want	to	say	that	we	are	 app 	 ly 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	to	 man 	 y 	 	world	 problem 	 s 	 	:	changing	the	drop	-	out	rates	of	school	 kid 	 s 	 	,	 combat 	 ing 	 	 addict 	 ions 	 	,	enhancing	teen	health	,	 cur 	 ing 	 	 vet 	 s 	 	'	ptsd	with	time	 metaphor 	 s 	 	--	 get 	 ting 	 	miracle	 cure 	 s 	 	--	promoting	 sustain 	 ability 	 	and	 conserv 	 ation 	 	,	 reduc 	 ing 	 	physical	 rehabilit 	 ation 	 	where	there	is	a	50	-	percent	drop	out	rate	,	 alter 	 ing 	 	 appeal 	 s 	 	to	 sui 	 cidal 	 	 terrorist 	 s 	 	,	and	 modify 	 ing 	 	family	 conflict 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	time	-	zone	 cl 	 ashes 	 	.
so	i	want	to	end	by	 say 	 ing 	 	:	 man 	 y 	 	of	life	's	 puzzl 	 es 	 	can	be	 solve 	 d 	 	by	 understand 	 ing 	 	your	time	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	and	that	of	 other 	 s 	 	.
and	the	idea	is	so	simple	,	so	obvious	,	but	i	think	the	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 pro 	 found 	 	.
thank	you	so	much	.
