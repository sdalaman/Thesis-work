when	i	was	nine	 year 	 s 	 	old	i	went	off	to	summer	camp	for	the	first	time	.
and	my	mother	 pack 	 ed 	 	me	a	 suit 	 case 	 	full	of	 book 	 s 	 	,	which	to	me	 seem 	 ed 	 	like	a	 perfect 	 ly 	 	natural	thing	to	do	.
 be 	 cause 	 	in	my	family	,	 read 	 ing 	 	was	the	 prim 	 ary 	 	group	activity	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	might	sound	 anti 	 social 	 	to	you	,	but	for	us	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	just	a	different	way	of	 be 	 ing 	 	social	.
you	have	the	animal	 warm 	 th 	 	of	your	family	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	right	next	to	you	,	but	you	are	 al 	 so 	 	free	to	go	 roam 	 ing 	 	around	the	 adventure 	 land 	 	 in 	 side 	 	your	own	mind	.
and	i	had	 th 	 is 	 	idea	that	camp	was	going	to	be	just	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	better	.
i	had	a	vision	of	10	 girl 	 s 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	a	 cab 	 in 	 	 co 	 zi 	 ly 	 	 read 	 ing 	 	 book 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 match 	 ing 	 	 night 	 gown 	 s 	 	.
camp	was	more	like	a	 ke 	 g 	 	party	 with 	 out 	 	any	alcohol	.
and	on	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	day	our	 counsel 	 or 	 	 gather 	 ed 	 	us	all	together	and	she	taught	us	a	cheer	that	she	 s 	 aid 	 	we	would	be	 do 	 ing 	 	every	day	for	the	rest	of	the	summer	to	instill	camp	spirit	.
and	it	went	like	 th 	 is 	 	:	``	r	-	o	-	w	-	d	-	i	-	e	,	that	's	the	way	we	spell	 row 	 die 	 	.	 row 	 die 	 	,	 row 	 die 	 	,	let	's	get	 row 	 die 	 	.	``	 yea 	 h 	 	.
so	i	could	n't	figure	out	for	the	life	of	me	why	we	 we 	 re 	 	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	so	 row 	 dy 	 	,	or	why	we	had	to	spell	 th 	 is 	 	word	 in 	 correct 	 ly 	 	.
but	i	 re 	 cit 	 ed 	 	a	cheer	.	i	 re 	 cit 	 ed 	 	a	cheer	 a 	 long 	 	with	 every 	 body 	 	else	.
i	did	my	best	.
and	i	just	 wait 	 ed 	 	for	the	time	that	i	could	go	off	and	read	my	 book 	 s 	 	.
but	the	first	time	that	i	took	my	book	out	of	my	 suit 	 case 	 	,	the	 cool 	 est 	 	girl	in	the	bunk	came	up	to	me	and	she	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	,	``	why	are	you	 be 	 ing 	 	so	 mel 	 low 	 	?	``	--
 mel 	 low 	 	,	of	course	,	 be 	 ing 	 	the	exact	 oppos 	 ite 	 	of	r	-	o	-	w	-	d	-	i	-	e	.
and	then	the	second	time	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	it	,	the	 counsel 	 or 	 	came	up	to	me	with	a	 concern 	 ed 	 	 express 	 ion 	 	on	her	face	and	she	 repeat 	 ed 	 	the	point	about	camp	spirit	and	 s 	 aid 	 	we	should	all	work	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	be	 out 	 going 	 	.
and	so	i	put	my	 book 	 s 	 	away	,	back	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 suit 	 case 	 	,	and	i	put	them	under	my	bed	,	and	there	they	 stay 	 ed 	 	for	the	rest	of	the	summer	.
and	i	felt	kind	of	 guilt 	 y 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	felt	 a 	 s 	 	if	the	 book 	 s 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	me	 some 	 how 	 	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 call 	 ing 	 	out	to	me	and	i	was	 for 	 s 	 a 	 king 	 	them	.
but	i	did	 for 	 sake 	 	them	and	i	did	n't	open	that	 suit 	 case 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	 un 	 til 	 	i	was	back	home	with	my	family	at	the	end	of	the	summer	.
now	,	i	tell	you	 th 	 is 	 	story	about	summer	camp	.
i	could	have	told	you	50	 other 	 s 	 	just	like	it	--	all	the	 time 	 s 	 	that	i	got	the	 mess 	 age 	 	that	 some 	 how 	 	my	quiet	and	 introvert 	 ed 	 	style	of	 be 	 ing 	 	was	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	the	right	way	to	go	,	that	i	should	be	 try 	 ing 	 	to	pass	 a 	 s 	 	more	of	an	extrovert	.
and	i	 al 	 ways 	 	 sens 	 ed 	 	deep	down	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	wrong	and	that	 introvert 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	 excel 	 lent 	 	just	 a 	 s 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	.
but	for	 year 	 s 	 	i	 deni 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 intuit 	 ion 	 	,	and	so	i	 be 	 came 	 	a	wall	street	lawyer	,	of	all	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	the	writer	that	i	had	 al 	 ways 	 	 long 	 ed 	 	to	be	--	 part 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 need 	 ed 	 	to	prove	to	 my 	 self 	 	that	i	could	be	bold	and	 assert 	 ive 	 	too	.
and	i	was	 al 	 ways 	 	going	off	to	 crowd 	 ed 	 	 bar 	 s 	 	when	i	 re 	 ally 	 	would	have	 prefer 	 red 	 	to	just	have	a	nice	 d 	 inner 	 	with	 friend 	 s 	 	.
and	i	made	these	self	-	 neg 	 ating 	 	 choice 	 s 	 	so	 re 	 flex 	 ively 	 	,	that	i	was	n't	even	aware	that	i	was	making	them	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 man 	 y 	 	 introvert 	 s 	 	do	,	and	it	's	our	loss	for	 s 	 ure 	 	,	but	it	is	 al 	 so 	 	our	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	'	loss	and	our	 commun 	 ities 	 	'	loss	.
and	at	the	risk	of	 sound 	 ing 	 	 grand 	 iose 	 	,	it	is	the	world	's	loss	.
 be 	 cause 	 	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	and	to	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	,	we	need	 introvert 	 s 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	what	they	do	best	.
a	third	to	a	half	of	the	population	are	 introvert 	 s 	 	--	a	third	to	a	half	.
so	that	's	one	out	of	every	two	or	three	people	you	know	.
so	even	if	you	're	an	extrovert	 your 	 self 	 	,	i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	your	 co 	 work 	 ers 	 	and	your	 spouse 	 s 	 	and	your	children	and	the	person	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	next	to	you	right	now	--	all	of	them	subject	to	 th 	 is 	 	bias	that	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	deep	and	real	in	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
we	all	 internal 	 ize 	 	it	from	a	 ver 	 y 	 	early	age	 with 	 out 	 	even	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	language	for	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	.
now	to	see	the	bias	 clear 	 ly 	 	you	need	to	understand	what	 intro 	 version 	 	is	.
it	's	different	from	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 hy 	 	.
 s 	 hy 	 ness 	 	is	about	fear	of	social	judgment	.
 intro 	 version 	 	is	more	about	,	how	do	you	respond	to	 stimul 	 ation 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	social	 stimul 	 ation 	 	.
so	 extrovert 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 crav 	 e 	 	large	 amount 	 s 	 	of	 stimul 	 ation 	 	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	 introvert 	 s 	 	feel	at	 the 	 ir 	 	most	 al 	 ive 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	most	 s 	 witch 	 ed 	 	-	on	and	 the 	 ir 	 	most	 cap 	 able 	 	when	they	're	in	 quiet 	 er 	 	,	more	low	-	key	 environment 	 s 	 	.
not	all	the	time	--	these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	n't	absolute	--	but	a	lot	of	the	time	.
so	the	key	then	to	 maxim 	 izing 	 	our	 talent 	 s 	 	is	for	us	all	to	put	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	the	zone	of	 stimul 	 ation 	 	that	is	right	for	us	.
but	now	here	's	where	the	bias	 come 	 s 	 	in	.
our	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 institution 	 s 	 	,	our	 school 	 s 	 	and	our	 work 	 place 	 s 	 	,	they	are	designed	 most 	 ly 	 	for	 extrovert 	 s 	 	and	for	 extrovert 	 s 	 	'	need	for	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 stimul 	 ation 	 	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	belief	system	right	now	that	i	call	the	new	 group 	 think 	 	,	which	 hold 	 s 	 	that	all	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	and	all	 product 	 ivity 	 	 come 	 s 	 	from	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 odd 	 ly 	 	gregarious	place	.
so	if	you	picture	the	typical	 class 	 room 	 	 now 	 a 	 day 	 s 	 	:	when	i	was	going	to	school	,	we	 s 	 at 	 	in	 row 	 s 	 	.
we	 s 	 at 	 	in	 row 	 s 	 	of	 desk 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	we	did	most	of	our	work	 pre 	 tty 	 	 autonomous 	 ly 	 	.
but	 now 	 a 	 day 	 s 	 	,	your	typical	 class 	 room 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	pods	of	 desk 	 s 	 	--	four	or	five	or	six	or	seven	 kid 	 s 	 	all	facing	each	other	.
and	 kid 	 s 	 	are	 work 	 ing 	 	in	 count 	 less 	 	group	 assign 	 ments 	 	.
even	in	 subject 	 s 	 	like	math	and	creative	writing	,	which	you	think	would	depend	on	 s 	 olo 	 	 flight 	 s 	 	of	thought	,	 kid 	 s 	 	are	now	 expect 	 ed 	 	to	act	 a 	 s 	 	 commit 	 tee 	 	 member 	 s 	 	.
and	for	the	 kid 	 s 	 	who	prefer	to	go	off	by	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	or	just	to	work	 al 	 one 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	are	 s 	 een 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 out 	 lier 	 s 	 	often	or	,	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	problem	 case 	 s 	 	.
and	the	vast	 major 	 ity 	 	of	 teacher 	 s 	 	 report 	 s 	 	 believ 	 ing 	 	that	the	ideal	student	is	an	extrovert	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	an	introvert	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	 introvert 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	better	 grade 	 s 	 	and	are	more	 knowledge 	 able 	 	,	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	research	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	same	thing	is	true	in	our	 work 	 place 	 s 	 	.
now	,	most	of	us	work	in	open	plan	 off 	 ice 	 s 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	 wall 	 s 	 	,	where	we	are	subject	to	the	constant	noise	and	 gaz 	 e 	 	of	our	 co 	 work 	 ers 	 	.
and	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	,	 introvert 	 s 	 	are	 routine 	 ly 	 	 pass 	 ed 	 	over	for	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	 position 	 s 	 	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	 introvert 	 s 	 	tend	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 care 	 ful 	 	,	much	less	 like 	 ly 	 	to	take	 out 	 s 	 ize 	 	 risk 	 s 	 	--	which	is	 some 	 thing 	 	we	might	all	favor	 now 	 a 	 day 	 s 	 	.
and	 interest 	 ing 	 	research	by	adam	grant	at	the	wharton	school	 ha 	 s 	 	found	that	 introvert 	 ed 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	often	deliver	better	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	than	 extrovert 	 s 	 	do	,	 be 	 cause 	 	when	they	are	 man 	 aging 	 	 pro 	 active 	 	 employ 	 ees 	 	,	they	're	much	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	let	 t 	 hose 	 	 employ 	 ees 	 	run	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	an	extrovert	can	,	 quit 	 e 	 	 unwitt 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	get	so	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	 thing 	 s 	 	that	they	're	 put 	 ting 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	stamp	on	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	other	people	's	 idea 	 s 	 	might	not	 a 	 s 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	then	bubble	up	to	the	surface	.
now	in	fact	,	some	of	our	 transform 	 ative 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 introvert 	 s 	 	.
i	'll	give	you	some	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
eleanor	roosevelt	,	rosa	 park 	 s 	 	,	gandhi	--	all	these	 people 	 d 	 	 de 	 scribed 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 a 	 s 	 	quiet	and	soft	-	spoken	and	even	 s 	 hy 	 	.
and	they	all	took	the	 spot 	 light 	 	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	every	bone	in	 the 	 ir 	 	bodies	was	 tell 	 ing 	 	them	not	to	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	have	a	special	power	all	 it 	 s 	 	own	,	 be 	 cause 	 	people	could	feel	that	these	 lead 	 ers 	 	 we 	 re 	 	at	the	helm	,	not	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 enjoy 	 ed 	 	 direct 	 ing 	 	 other 	 s 	 	and	not	out	of	the	pleasure	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	at	;	they	 we 	 re 	 	there	 be 	 cause 	 	they	had	no	choice	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	driven	to	do	what	they	thought	was	right	.
now	i	think	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	for	me	to	say	that	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	love	 extrovert 	 s 	 	.
i	 al 	 ways 	 	like	to	say	some	of	my	best	 friend 	 s 	 	are	 extrovert 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	my	 be 	 love 	 d 	 	husband	.
and	we	all	fall	at	different	 point 	 s 	 	,	of	course	,	 a 	 long 	 	the	introvert	/	extrovert	spectrum	.
even	carl	jung	,	the	 psycho 	 logist 	 	who	first	 popular 	 ized 	 	these	 term 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 aid 	 	that	there	's	no	 s 	 uch 	 	thing	 a 	 s 	 	a	 pur 	 e 	 	introvert	or	a	 pur 	 e 	 	extrovert	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	that	 s 	 uch 	 	a	man	would	be	in	a	 lun 	 atic 	 	asylum	,	if	he	 exist 	 ed 	 	at	all	.
and	some	people	fall	 s 	 mack 	 	in	the	middle	of	the	introvert	/	extrovert	spectrum	,	and	we	call	these	people	 ambi 	 vert 	 s 	 	.
and	i	often	think	that	they	have	the	best	of	all	 world 	 s 	 	.
but	 man 	 y 	 	of	us	do	 recogn 	 ize 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 a 	 s 	 	one	type	or	the	other	.
and	what	i	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	is	that	 cultural 	 ly 	 	we	need	a	much	better	balance	.
we	need	more	of	a	 y 	 in 	 	and	 y 	 ang 	 	between	these	two	 type 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	and	to	 product 	 ivity 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	when	 psycho 	 logists 	 	look	at	the	 live 	 s 	 	of	the	most	creative	people	,	what	they	find	are	people	who	are	 ver 	 y 	 	good	at	 ex 	 changing 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	and	 advanc 	 ing 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	,	but	who	 al 	 so 	 	have	a	serious	streak	of	 intro 	 version 	 	in	them	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	 s 	 ol 	 itude 	 	is	a	 cruci 	 al 	 	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 	often	to	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	.

so	no	 wild 	 er 	 ness 	 	,	no	 revel 	 ations 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	no	surprise	 th 	 ough 	 	if	you	look	at	the	 in 	 sight 	 s 	 	of	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	 psycho 	 logy 	 	.

so	...
you	might	be	 follow 	 ing 	 	the	person	with	the	best	 idea 	 s 	 	,	but	you	might	not	.
and	do	you	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	 leav 	 e 	 	it	up	to	chance	?
much	better	for	 every 	 body 	 	to	go	off	by	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	generate	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 idea 	 s 	 	 free 	 d 	 	from	the	 distort 	 ions 	 	of	group	 dynamic 	 s 	 	,	and	then	come	together	 a 	 s 	 	a	team	to	talk	them	through	in	a	well	-	 manage 	 d 	 	environment	and	take	it	from	there	.
now	if	all	 th 	 is 	 	is	true	,	then	why	are	we	 get 	 ting 	 	it	so	wrong	?
why	are	we	setting	up	our	 school 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	way	and	our	 work 	 place 	 s 	 	?

one	answer	lies	deep	in	our	cultural	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
western	 socie 	 ties 	 	,	and	in	 part 	 icular 	 	the	u.s.	,	have	 al 	 ways 	 	 favor 	 ed 	 	the	man	of	action	over	the	man	of	 contempl 	 ation 	 	and	``	man	``	of	 contempl 	 ation 	 	.
but	in	america	's	early	 day 	 s 	 	,	we	lived	in	what	 historian 	 s 	 	call	a	culture	of	character	,	where	we	still	,	at	that	point	,	 valu 	 ed 	 	people	for	 the 	 ir 	 	inner	 s 	 elves 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	moral	 rect 	 itude 	 	.
and	if	you	look	at	the	self	-	help	 book 	 s 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	era	,	they	all	had	 title 	 s 	 	with	 thing 	 s 	 	like	``	character	,	the	 grand 	 est 	 	thing	in	the	world	.	``
and	they	 feature 	 d 	 	role	 model 	 s 	 	like	abraham	lincoln	who	was	 praise 	 d 	 	for	 be 	 ing 	 	modest	and	 un 	 assum 	 ing 	 	.
ralph	waldo	emerson	 call 	 ed 	 	him	``	a	man	who	 do 	 es 	 	not	offend	by	 super 	 ior 	 ity 	 	.	``
but	then	we	hit	the	20th	century	and	we	 enter 	 ed 	 	a	new	culture	that	 historian 	 s 	 	call	the	culture	of	 personal 	 ity 	 	.
what	 happen 	 ed 	 	is	we	had	 evolv 	 ed 	 	an	 agricultur 	 al 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	to	a	world	of	big	business	.
and	so	 sudden 	 ly 	 	people	are	moving	from	small	 town 	 s 	 	to	the	cities	.
and	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 work 	 ing 	 	 a 	 long 	 side 	 	people	they	've	known	all	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	,	now	they	are	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	prove	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	a	crowd	of	 strange 	 rs 	 	.
so	,	 quit 	 e 	 	 understand 	 ably 	 	,	 qual 	 ities 	 	like	 magnet 	 ism 	 	and	charisma	 sudden 	 ly 	 	come	to	seem	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
and	 s 	 ure 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	the	self	-	help	 book 	 s 	 	change	to	meet	these	new	 need 	 s 	 	and	they	start	to	have	 name 	 s 	 	like	``	how	to	win	 friend 	 s 	 	and	influence	people	.	``
and	they	feature	 a 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	role	 model 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	great	 sale 	 s 	 men 	 	.
so	that	's	the	world	we	're	living	in	 to 	 day 	 	.
that	's	our	cultural	 inherit 	 ance 	 	.
now	 non 	 e 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	to	say	that	social	 skill 	 s 	 	are	 un 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	and	i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	not	 call 	 ing 	 	for	the	 abolish 	 ing 	 	of	 team 	 work 	 	at	all	.
the	same	 relig 	 ions 	 	who	 s 	 end 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 s 	 age 	 s 	 	off	to	 lone 	 ly 	 	mountain	 top 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	teach	us	love	and	trust	.
and	the	 problem 	 s 	 	that	we	are	facing	 to 	 day 	 	in	 field 	 s 	 	like	science	and	in	 economic 	 s 	 	are	so	vast	and	so	complex	that	we	are	going	to	need	 arm 	 ies 	 	of	people	coming	together	to	solve	them	 work 	 ing 	 	together	.
but	i	am	 say 	 ing 	 	that	the	more	 free 	 dom 	 	that	we	give	 introvert 	 s 	 	to	be	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	the	more	 like 	 ly 	 	that	they	are	to	come	up	with	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 un 	 ique 	 	 solution 	 s 	 	to	these	 problem 	 s 	 	.
so	now	i	'd	like	to	share	with	you	what	's	in	my	 suit 	 case 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
guess	what	?
 book 	 s 	 	.
i	have	a	 suit 	 case 	 	full	of	 book 	 s 	 	.
here	's	margaret	atwood	,	``	cat	's	eye	.	``
here	's	a	novel	by	milan	kundera	.
and	here	's	``	the	guide	for	the	 per 	 plex 	 ed 	 	``	by	maimonides	.
but	these	are	not	 exact 	 ly 	 	my	 book 	 s 	 	.
i	 br 	 ought 	 	these	 book 	 s 	 	with	me	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	written	by	my	 grand 	 father 	 	's	 favor 	 ite 	 	 author 	 s 	 	.
my	 grand 	 father 	 	was	a	rabbi	and	he	was	a	 widow 	 er 	 	who	lived	 al 	 one 	 	in	a	small	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	in	brooklyn	that	was	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	place	in	the	world	when	i	was	growing	up	,	 part 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	his	 ver 	 y 	 	gentle	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 court 	 ly 	 	presence	and	 part 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	 book 	 s 	 	.
i	mean	 liter 	 ally 	 	every	table	,	every	chair	in	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	had	 yield 	 ed 	 	 it 	 s 	 	original	function	to	now	serve	 a 	 s 	 	a	surface	for	 s 	 way 	 ing 	 	 stack 	 s 	 	of	 book 	 s 	 	.
just	like	the	rest	of	my	family	,	my	 grand 	 father 	 	's	 favor 	 ite 	 	thing	to	do	in	the	whole	world	was	to	read	.
but	he	 al 	 so 	 	 love 	 d 	 	his	 congreg 	 ation 	 	,	and	you	could	feel	 th 	 is 	 	love	in	the	 sermon 	 s 	 	that	he	 g 	 ave 	 	every	week	for	the	62	 year 	 s 	 	that	he	was	a	rabbi	.
he	would	 take 	 s 	 	the	 fruit 	 s 	 	of	each	week	's	 read 	 ing 	 	and	he	would	weave	these	 intric 	 ate 	 	 tape 	 s 	 tries 	 	of	ancient	and	 human 	 ist 	 	thought	.
and	people	would	come	from	all	over	to	hear	him	speak	.
but	here	's	the	thing	about	my	 grand 	 father 	 	.
 under 	 neath 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 ceremoni 	 al 	 	role	,	he	was	 re 	 ally 	 	modest	and	 re 	 ally 	 	 introvert 	 ed 	 	--	so	much	so	that	when	he	 deliver 	 ed 	 	these	 sermon 	 s 	 	,	he	had	trouble	making	eye	contact	with	the	 ver 	 y 	 	same	 congreg 	 ation 	 	that	he	had	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 peaking 	 	to	for	62	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	even	away	from	the	 pod 	 ium 	 	,	when	you	 call 	 ed 	 	him	to	say	 hell 	 o 	 	,	he	would	often	end	the	conversation	 pre 	 mature 	 ly 	 	for	fear	that	he	was	taking	up	too	much	of	your	time	.
but	when	he	 di 	 ed 	 	at	the	age	of	94	,	the	police	had	to	close	down	the	 street 	 s 	 	of	his	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	to	 accommo 	 date 	 	the	crowd	of	people	who	came	out	to	mourn	him	.
and	so	these	 day 	 s 	 	i	try	to	learn	from	my	 grand 	 father 	 	's	 ex 	 ample 	 	in	my	own	way	.
so	i	just	 publish 	 ed 	 	a	book	about	 intro 	 version 	 	,	and	it	took	me	about	seven	 year 	 s 	 	to	write	.
and	for	me	,	that	seven	 year 	 s 	 	was	like	total	 bli 	 s 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	 read 	 ing 	 	,	i	was	writing	,	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	,	i	was	 research 	 ing 	 	.
it	was	my	version	of	my	 grand 	 father 	 	's	 hour 	 s 	 	of	the	day	 al 	 one 	 	in	his	library	.
but	now	all	of	a	sudden	my	job	is	 ver 	 y 	 	different	,	and	my	job	is	to	be	out	here	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	it	,	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 intro 	 version 	 	.
and	that	's	a	lot	 hard 	 er 	 	for	me	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 honor 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	i	am	to	be	here	with	all	of	you	right	now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	my	natural	milieu	.
so	i	prepared	for	 moment 	 s 	 	like	these	 a 	 s 	 	best	i	could	.
i	 s 	 pent 	 	the	last	year	 p 	 rac 	 tic 	 ing 	 	public	 s 	 peaking 	 	every	chance	i	could	get	.
and	i	call	 th 	 is 	 	my	``	year	of	 s 	 peaking 	 	 danger 	 ously 	 	.	``
and	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 help 	 ed 	 	a	lot	.
but	i	'll	tell	you	,	what	 help 	 s 	 	even	more	is	my	sense	,	my	belief	,	my	hope	that	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	our	 attitude 	 s 	 	to	 intro 	 version 	 	and	to	quiet	and	to	 s 	 ol 	 itude 	 	,	we	 tru 	 ly 	 	are	 poise 	 d 	 	on	the	 br 	 ink 	 	on	 dramat 	 ic 	 	change	.
i	mean	,	we	are	.
and	so	i	am	going	to	 leav 	 e 	 	you	now	with	three	 call 	 s 	 	for	action	for	 t 	 hose 	 	who	share	 th 	 is 	 	vision	.
number	one	:	stop	the	 mad 	 ness 	 	for	constant	group	work	.
just	stop	it	.
thank	you	.
and	i	want	to	be	clear	about	what	i	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 deep 	 ly 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	our	 off 	 ice 	 s 	 	should	be	 encourag 	 ing 	 	casual	,	 chat 	 ty 	 	cafe	-	style	 type 	 s 	 	of	 interact 	 ions 	 	--	you	know	,	the	kind	where	people	come	together	and	 serendipitous 	 ly 	 	have	an	 ex 	 change 	 	of	 idea 	 s 	 	.
that	is	great	.
it	's	great	for	 introvert 	 s 	 	and	it	's	great	for	 extrovert 	 s 	 	.
but	we	need	much	more	 pri 	 vac 	 y 	 	and	much	more	 free 	 dom 	 	and	much	more	 auto 	 nomy 	 	at	work	.
school	,	same	thing	.
we	need	to	be	 teach 	 ing 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	to	work	together	,	for	 s 	 ure 	 	,	but	we	 al 	 so 	 	need	to	be	 teach 	 ing 	 	them	how	to	work	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	for	 extrovert 	 ed 	 	children	too	.
they	need	to	work	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 be 	 cause 	 	that	is	where	deep	thought	 come 	 s 	 	from	in	part	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	number	two	:	go	to	the	 wild 	 er 	 ness 	 	.
be	like	buddha	,	have	your	own	 revel 	 ations 	 	.
i	'm	not	 say 	 ing 	 	that	we	all	have	to	now	go	off	and	build	our	own	 cab 	 in 	 s 	 	in	the	 wood 	 s 	 	and	never	talk	to	each	other	 aga 	 in 	 	,	but	i	am	 say 	 ing 	 	that	we	could	all	stand	to	 un 	 plug 	 	and	get	 in 	 side 	 	our	own	 head 	 s 	 	a	little	more	often	.
number	three	:	take	a	good	look	at	what	's	 in 	 side 	 	your	own	 suit 	 case 	 	and	why	you	put	it	there	.
so	 extrovert 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	your	 suit 	 case 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 so 	 	full	of	 book 	 s 	 	.
or	 may 	 be 	 	they	're	full	of	 champ 	 agne 	 	 glass 	 es 	 	or	 sky 	 div 	 ing 	 	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	.
 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	,	i	hope	you	take	these	 thing 	 s 	 	out	every	chance	you	get	and	grace	us	with	your	energy	and	your	joy	.
but	 introvert 	 s 	 	,	you	 be 	 ing 	 	you	,	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	have	the	impulse	to	guard	 ver 	 y 	 	 care 	 fully 	 	what	's	 in 	 side 	 	your	own	 suit 	 case 	 	.
and	that	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
but	 occasion 	 ally 	 	,	just	 occasion 	 ally 	 	,	i	hope	you	will	open	up	your	 suit 	 case 	 s 	 	for	other	people	to	see	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	world	 need 	 s 	 	you	and	it	 need 	 s 	 	the	 thing 	 s 	 	you	carry	.
so	i	wish	you	the	best	of	all	possible	 journey 	 s 	 	and	the	courage	to	speak	 soft 	 ly 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
thank	you	.	thank	you	.
