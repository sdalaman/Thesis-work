you	know	,	i	am	so	bad	at	tech	that	my	daughter	--	who	is	now	41	--	when	she	was	five	,	was	 over 	 heard 	 	by	me	to	say	to	a	friend	of	 her 	 s 	 	,	if	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 ble 	 ed 	 	when	you	cut	it	,	my	 d 	 addy 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	understand	it	.
so	,	the	 assign 	 ment 	 	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 give 	 n 	 	may	be	an	 in 	 super 	 able 	 	obstacle	for	me	,	but	i	'm	 certain 	 ly 	 	going	to	try	.
what	have	i	heard	 dur 	 ing 	 	these	last	four	 day 	 s 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	my	third	visit	to	ted	.
one	was	to	tedmed	,	and	one	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	've	heard	,	was	a	regular	ted	two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
i	've	heard	what	i	consider	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	thing	that	i	've	 on 	 ly 	 	heard	a	little	bit	in	the	two	previous	teds	,	and	what	that	is	is	an	 inter 	 weaving 	 	and	an	 inter 	 lar 	 d 	 ing 	 	,	an	 inter 	 mix 	 ing 	 	,	of	a	sense	of	social	 respons 	 ibility 	 	in	so	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 talk 	 s 	 	--	global	 respons 	 ibility 	 	,	in	fact	,	 appeal 	 ing 	 	to	 enlighten 	 ed 	 	self	-	interest	,	but	it	 go 	 es 	 	far	beyond	 enlighten 	 ed 	 	self	-	interest	.
one	of	the	most	 impress 	 ive 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	about	what	some	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	10	,	of	the	 speaker 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	is	the	 real 	 ization 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	listen	to	them	 care 	 fully 	 	,	that	they	're	not	 say 	 ing 	 	:	well	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	should	do	;	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	would	like	you	to	do	.
it	's	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	have	 d 	 one 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	'm	 excit 	 ed 	 	by	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	thing	,	and	it	's	 d 	 one 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	for	me	and	,	of	course	,	it	's	 accomplish 	 ed 	 	a	great	deal	.
it	's	the	old	 con 	 cept 	 	,	the	real	greek	 con 	 cept 	 	,	of	 philanthro 	 py 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	original	sense	:	phil	-	anthropy	,	the	love	of	 human 	 kind 	 	.
and	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 explan 	 ation 	 	i	can	have	for	some	of	what	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	 hear 	 ing 	 	in	the	last	four	 day 	 s 	 	is	that	it	 arise 	 s 	 	,	in	fact	,	out	of	a	form	of	love	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 give 	 s 	 	me	enormous	hope	.
and	hope	,	of	course	,	is	the	 top 	 ic 	 	that	i	'm	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	 s 	 peaking 	 	about	,	which	i	'd	 complete 	 ly 	 	 for 	 gotten 	 	about	 un 	 til 	 	i	 arriv 	 ed 	 	.
and	when	i	did	,	i	thought	,	well	,	i	'd	better	look	 th 	 is 	 	word	up	in	the	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	.
so	,	sarah	and	i	--	my	wife	--	 walk 	 ed 	 	over	to	the	public	library	,	which	is	four	 block 	 s 	 	away	,	on	 pac 	 ific 	 	street	,	and	we	got	the	oed	,	and	we	 look 	 ed 	 	in	there	,	and	there	are	14	 definition 	 s 	 	of	hope	,	 non 	 e 	 	of	which	 re 	 ally 	 	 hit 	 s 	 	you	between	the	 eye 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	the	appropriate	one	.
and	,	of	course	,	that	 make 	 s 	 	sense	,	 be 	 cause 	 	hope	is	an	abstract	 phenomen 	 on 	 	;	it	's	an	abstract	idea	,	it	's	not	a	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	word	.
well	,	it	 re 	 mind 	 s 	 	me	a	little	bit	of	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	.
if	there	's	one	operation	for	a	disease	,	you	know	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
if	there	are	15	 operation 	 s 	 	,	you	know	that	 non 	 e 	 	of	them	work	.
and	that	's	the	way	it	is	with	 definition 	 s 	 	of	 word 	 s 	 	.
if	you	have	 append 	 ic 	 itis 	 	,	they	take	your	 append 	 ix 	 	out	,	and	you	're	 cur 	 ed 	 	.
if	you	've	got	 re 	 flux 	 	 oesophag 	 itis 	 	,	there	are	15	 procedure 	 s 	 	,	and	joe	schmo	 do 	 es 	 	it	one	way	and	will	blow	 do 	 es 	 	it	 an 	 other 	 	way	,	and	 non 	 e 	 	of	them	work	,	and	that	's	the	way	it	is	with	 th 	 is 	 	word	,	hope	.
they	all	come	down	to	the	idea	of	an	 expect 	 ation 	 	of	 some 	 thing 	 	good	that	is	due	to	happen	.
and	you	know	what	i	found	out	?
the	indo	-	european	root	of	the	word	hope	is	a	stem	,	k	-	e	-	u	--	we	would	spell	it	k	-	e	-	u	;	it	's	 pronounce 	 d 	 	 ko 	 y 	 	--	and	it	is	the	same	root	from	which	the	word	 curv 	 e 	 	 come 	 s 	 	from	.
but	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	in	the	original	indo	-	european	is	a	change	in	direction	,	going	in	a	different	way	.
and	i	find	that	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 pro 	 voc 	 ative 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	what	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	 hear 	 ing 	 	in	the	last	couple	of	 day 	 s 	 	is	the	sense	of	going	in	different	 direction 	 s 	 	:	 direction 	 s 	 	that	are	specific	and	 un 	 ique 	 	to	 problem 	 s 	 	.
there	are	different	 paradigm 	 s 	 	.
you	've	heard	that	word	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 time 	 s 	 	in	the	last	four	 day 	 s 	 	,	and	 every 	 one 	 	's	familiar	with	kuhnian	 paradigm 	 s 	 	.
so	,	when	we	think	of	hope	now	,	we	have	to	think	of	looking	in	other	 direction 	 s 	 	than	we	have	 be 	 en 	 	looking	.
there	's	 an 	 other 	 	--	not	definition	,	but	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	,	of	hope	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 appeal 	 ed 	 	to	me	,	and	it	was	one	by	v√°clav	havel	in	his	 perfect 	 ly 	 	spectacular	book	``	 break 	 ing 	 	the	peace	,	``	in	which	he	 say 	 s 	 	that	hope	 do 	 es 	 	not	consist	of	the	 expect 	 ation 	 	that	 thing 	 s 	 	will	come	out	 exact 	 ly 	 	right	,	but	the	 expect 	 ation 	 	that	they	will	make	sense	 regard 	 less 	 	of	how	they	come	out	.
i	ca	n't	tell	you	how	 re 	 assur 	 ed 	 	i	was	by	the	 ver 	 y 	 	last	sentence	in	that	 glor 	 ious 	 	 present 	 ation 	 	by	dean	kamen	a	few	 day 	 s 	 	ago	.
i	was	n't	 s 	 ure 	 	i	heard	it	right	,	so	i	found	him	in	one	of	the	inter	-	 session 	 s 	 	.
he	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	a	 ver 	 y 	 	large	man	,	but	i	did	n't	care	.	i	 interrupt 	 ed 	 	,	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	did	you	say	 th 	 is 	 	?	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	think	so	.	``
so	,	here	's	what	it	is	:	i	'll	repeat	it	.
``	the	world	will	not	be	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	by	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.	``	it	's	 wonder 	 ful 	 	.	do	you	know	what	the	world	will	be	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	by	?
i	'll	tell	you	.	it	'll	be	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	by	the	human	spirit	.
and	by	the	human	spirit	,	i	do	n't	mean	 any 	 thing 	 	divine	,	i	do	n't	mean	 any 	 thing 	 	 super 	 natural 	 	--	 certain 	 ly 	 	not	coming	from	 th 	 is 	 	skeptic	.
what	i	mean	is	 th 	 is 	 	ability	that	each	of	us	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 some 	 thing 	 	 great 	 er 	 	than	 her 	 self 	 	or	 him 	 self 	 	;	to	arise	out	of	our	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	 achiev 	 e 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	we	thought	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	not	 cap 	 able 	 	of	.
on	an	 element 	 al 	 	level	,	we	have	all	felt	that	 spiritual 	 ity 	 	at	the	time	of	 child 	 birth 	 	.
some	of	you	have	felt	it	in	 labor 	 ator 	 ies 	 	;	some	of	you	have	felt	it	at	the	 work 	 bench 	 	.
we	feel	it	at	 concert 	 s 	 	.
i	've	felt	it	in	the	 oper 	 ating 	 	room	,	at	the	 bed 	 side 	 	.
it	is	an	 elev 	 ation 	 	of	us	beyond	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
and	i	think	that	it	's	going	to	be	,	in	time	,	the	 element 	 s 	 	of	the	human	spirit	that	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 hear 	 ing 	 	about	bit	by	bit	by	bit	from	so	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 speaker 	 s 	 	in	the	last	few	 day 	 s 	 	.
and	if	there	's	 any 	 thing 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 permeate 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	it	is	 precise 	 ly 	 	that	.
i	'm	 intrigu 	 ed 	 	by	a	 con 	 cept 	 	that	was	 br 	 ought 	 	to	life	in	the	early	part	of	the	19th	century	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	in	the	second	decade	of	the	19th	century	--	by	a	27	-	year	-	old	poet	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	name	was	percy	shelley	.
now	,	we	all	think	that	shelley	 obvious 	 ly 	 	is	the	great	romantic	poet	that	he	was	;	 man 	 y 	 	of	us	tend	to	forget	that	he	wrote	some	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 essay 	 s 	 	,	too	,	and	the	most	well	-	 remember 	 ed 	 	essay	is	one	 call 	 ed 	 	``	a	defence	of	 poet 	 ry 	 	.	``
now	,	it	's	about	five	,	six	,	seven	,	eight	 page 	 s 	 	long	,	and	it	 get 	 s 	 	kind	of	deep	and	difficult	after	about	the	third	page	,	but	 some 	 where 	 	on	the	second	page	he	 begin 	 s 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	 not 	 ion 	 	that	he	 call 	 s 	 	``	moral	 imagin 	 ation 	 	.	``
and	here	's	what	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	 rough 	 ly 	 	 transl 	 ated 	 	:	a	man	--	generic	man	--	a	man	,	to	be	 great 	 ly 	 	good	,	must	imagine	 clear 	 ly 	 	.
he	must	see	 him 	 self 	 	and	the	world	through	the	 eye 	 s 	 	of	 an 	 other 	 	,	and	of	 man 	 y 	 	 other 	 s 	 	.
see	 him 	 self 	 	and	the	world	--	not	just	the	world	,	but	see	 him 	 self 	 	.
what	is	it	that	is	 expect 	 ed 	 	of	us	by	the	 billion 	 s 	 	of	people	who	live	in	what	laurie	garrett	the	other	day	so	 appropriate 	 ly 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	despair	and	 dis 	 par 	 ity 	 	?
what	is	it	that	they	have	every	right	to	ask	of	us	?
what	is	it	that	we	have	every	right	to	ask	of	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	out	of	our	 share 	 d 	 	 human 	 ity 	 	and	out	of	the	human	spirit	?
well	,	you	know	 precise 	 ly 	 	what	it	is	.
there	's	a	great	deal	of	argument	about	 whet 	 her 	 	we	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	great	nation	that	we	are	,	should	be	the	 police 	 man 	 	of	the	world	,	the	world	's	 con 	 s 	 tabula 	 ry 	 	,	but	there	should	be	 virtual 	 ly 	 	no	argument	about	 whet 	 her 	 	we	should	be	the	world	's	 heal 	 er 	 	.
there	 ha 	 s 	 	 certain 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	no	argument	about	that	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	in	the	past	four	 day 	 s 	 	.
so	,	if	we	are	to	be	the	world	's	 heal 	 er 	 	,	every	 dis 	 advantage 	 d 	 	person	in	 th 	 is 	 	world	--	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	--	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	our	patient	.
every	 dis 	 advantage 	 d 	 	nation	,	and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	our	own	nation	,	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	our	patient	.
so	,	it	's	 f 	 un 	 	to	think	about	the	 etymo 	 logy 	 	of	the	word	``	patient	.	``
it	 come 	 s 	 	 initi 	 ally 	 	from	the	latin	 pat 	 ior 	 	,	to	 endur 	 e 	 	,	or	to	suffer	.
so	,	you	go	back	to	the	old	indo	-	european	root	 aga 	 in 	 	,	and	what	do	you	find	?	the	indo	-	european	stem	is	 pronounce 	 d 	 	 pay 	 en 	 	--	we	would	spell	it	p	-	a	-	e	-	n	--	and	,	lo	and	 be 	 hold 	 	,	mirabile	 dict 	 u 	 	,	it	is	the	same	root	 a 	 s 	 	the	word	 compass 	 ion 	 	 come 	 s 	 	from	,	p	-	a	-	e	-	n	.
so	,	the	 less 	 on 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	.	the	 less 	 on 	 	is	that	our	patient	--	the	world	,	and	the	 dis 	 advantage 	 d 	 	of	the	world	--	that	patient	 deserve 	 s 	 	our	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
but	beyond	our	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	and	far	 great 	 er 	 	than	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	is	our	moral	 imagin 	 ation 	 	and	our	 ident 	 ification 	 	with	each	individual	who	 live 	 s 	 	in	that	world	,	not	to	think	of	them	 a 	 s 	 	a	huge	forest	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	individual	 tree 	 s 	 	.
of	course	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	day	and	age	,	the	trick	is	not	to	let	each	tree	be	 obscur 	 ed 	 	by	that	bush	in	washington	that	can	get	--	can	get	in	the	way	.
so	,	here	we	are	.
we	are	,	should	be	,	 moral 	 ly 	 	 commit 	 ted 	 	to	 be 	 ing 	 	the	 heal 	 er 	 	of	the	world	.
and	we	have	had	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	over	and	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	--	you	've	just	heard	one	in	the	last	15	 minute 	 s 	 	--	of	people	who	have	not	 on 	 ly 	 	had	that	 commit 	 ment 	 	,	but	had	the	charisma	,	the	 brilli 	 ance 	 	--	and	i	think	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	it	's	easy	to	use	the	word	 brilli 	 ant 	 	,	my	god	--	the	 brilli 	 ance 	 	to	succeed	at	 l 	 east 	 	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	quest	,	and	who	no	doubt	will	 continu 	 e 	 	to	succeed	,	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	more	and	more	of	us	enlist	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	cause	.
now	,	if	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	medicine	,	and	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 heal 	 ing 	 	,	i	'd	like	to	quote	 some 	 one 	 	who	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 be 	 en 	 	 quote 	 d 	 	.
it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	 every 	 body 	 	in	the	world	's	 be 	 en 	 	 quote 	 d 	 	here	:	 po 	 go 	 	's	 be 	 en 	 	 quote 	 d 	 	;	shakespeare	's	 be 	 en 	 	 quote 	 d 	 	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	 forward 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 side 	 	out	.
i	would	like	to	quote	one	of	my	own	 house 	 hold 	 	 god 	 s 	 	.
i	suspect	he	never	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	do	n't	know	what	hippocrates	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	but	we	do	know	for	 s 	 ure 	 	that	one	of	the	great	greek	 physician 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	,	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 record 	 ed 	 	in	one	of	the	 book 	 s 	 	 attribut 	 ed 	 	to	hippocrates	,	and	the	book	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 pre 	 cept 	 s 	 	.	``
and	i	'll	read	you	what	it	is	.
remember	,	i	have	 be 	 en 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	,	 essential 	 ly 	 	 philanthro 	 py 	 	:	the	love	of	 human 	 kind 	 	,	the	individual	 human 	 kind 	 	and	the	individual	 human 	 kind 	 	that	can	 br 	 ing 	 	that	kind	of	love	 transl 	 ated 	 	 in 	 to 	 	action	,	 transl 	 ated 	 	,	in	some	 case 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 to 	 	 enlighten 	 ed 	 	self	-	interest	.
and	here	he	is	,	2,400	 year 	 s 	 	ago	:	``	where	there	is	love	of	 human 	 kind 	 	,	there	is	love	of	 heal 	 ing 	 	.	``
we	have	 s 	 een 	 	that	here	 to 	 day 	 	with	the	sense	,	with	the	 sensitiv 	 ity 	 	--	and	in	the	last	three	 day 	 s 	 	,	and	with	the	power	of	the	 in 	 dom 	 it 	 able 	 	human	spirit	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
