i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	about	my	place	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	and	about	my	first	thought	about	what	 in 	 fin 	 ity 	 	might	mean	,	when	i	was	a	child	.
and	i	thought	that	if	time	could	reach	 forward 	 s 	 	and	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	 infinite 	 ly 	 	,	 do 	 es 	 	n't	that	mean	that	every	point	in	time	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 infinite 	 ly 	 	small	,	and	 there 	 fore 	 	 some 	 what 	 	 meaning 	 less 	 	.
so	we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	have	a	place	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	on	a	time	line	.
but	 noth 	 ing 	 	else	 do 	 es 	 	either	.
 there 	 fore 	 	every	moment	 re 	 ally 	 	is	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	moment	that	's	ever	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	moment	right	now	.
and	so	 there 	 fore 	 	 th 	 is 	 	music	you	're	about	to	hear	is	 may 	 be 	 	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	music	you	'll	ever	hear	in	your	life	.
thank	you	.
for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	i	'll	be	fortunate	 en 	 ough 	 	to	meet	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	you	could	 pleas 	 e 	 	 refr 	 ain 	 	from	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	oh	my	god	,	you	're	so	much	 short 	 er 	 	in	real	life	.	``
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	like	the	stage	is	an	optical	illusion	,
for	some	reason	.
 some 	 what 	 	like	the	 curv 	 ing 	 	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
i	do	n't	know	what	it	is	.	i	get	 ask 	 ed 	 	in	 interview 	 s 	 	a	lot	,	``	my	god	,	you	're	 guitar 	 s 	 	are	so	 gig 	 antic 	 	!	``
``	you	must	get	them	custom	made	--	special	,	 hum 	 ong 	 ous 	 	 guitar 	 s 	 	.	``
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
