for	a	long	time	,	there	was	me	,	and	my	body	.
me	was	 compose 	 d 	 	of	 st 	 ories 	 	,	of	 crav 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	of	 striv 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	of	 desir 	 es 	 	of	the	future	.	me	was	 try 	 ing 	 	not	to	be	an	 out 	 come 	 	of	my	violent	past	,	but	the	 separat 	 ion 	 	that	had	 al 	 ready 	 	 occur 	 red 	 	between	me	and	my	body	was	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	significant	 out 	 come 	 	.
me	was	 al 	 ways 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	,	 some 	 body 	 	.
me	 on 	 ly 	 	 exist 	 ed 	 	in	the	 try 	 ing 	 	.
my	body	was	often	in	the	way	.
me	was	a	 float 	 ing 	 	head	.	for	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 wo 	 re 	 	 hat 	 s 	 	.
it	was	a	way	of	 keep 	 ing 	 	my	head	 attach 	 ed 	 	.
it	was	a	way	of	 loc 	 ating 	 	 my 	 self 	 	.
i	 worri 	 ed 	 	that	[	if	]	i	took	my	hat	off	i	would	n't	be	here	 any 	 more 	 	.
i	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	a	therapist	who	once	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	``	eve	,	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	coming	here	for	two	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	,	to	be	honest	,	it	never	 occur 	 red 	 	to	me	that	you	had	a	body	.	``	all	 th 	 is 	 	time	i	lived	in	the	city	 be 	 cause 	 	,	to	be	honest	,	i	was	 af 	 raid 	 	of	 tree 	 s 	 	.
i	never	had	 bab 	 ies 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 head 	 s 	 	can	not	give	birth	.
 bab 	 ies 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	n't	come	out	of	your	mouth	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	had	no	 re 	 ference 	 	point	for	my	body	,	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	ask	other	women	about	 the 	 ir 	 	bodies	--	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 vagina 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	thought	 vagina 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	kind	of	 import 	 ant 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	led	to	me	writing	``	the	vagina	 monologue 	 s 	 	,	``	which	led	to	me	 obsess 	 ively 	 	and	 incessant 	 ly 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 vagina 	 s 	 	 every 	 where 	 	i	could	.
i	did	 th 	 is 	 	in	front	of	 man 	 y 	 	 strange 	 rs 	 	.
one	night	on	stage	,	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	 enter 	 ed 	 	my	vagina	.
it	was	an	 ec 	 static 	 	experience	.
it	 scar 	 ed 	 	me	,	it	 energ 	 ized 	 	me	,	and	then	i	 be 	 came 	 	a	driven	person	,	a	driven	vagina	.
i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	see	my	body	like	a	thing	,	a	thing	that	could	move	fast	,	like	a	thing	that	could	accomplish	other	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	all	at	once	.
i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	see	my	body	like	an	ipad	or	a	car	.
i	would	drive	it	and	demand	 thing 	 s 	 	from	it	.
it	had	no	 limit 	 s 	 	.	it	was	 invinc 	 ible 	 	.
it	was	to	be	 conquer 	 ed 	 	and	 master 	 ed 	 	like	the	earth	 her 	 self 	 	.
i	did	n't	 he 	 ed 	 	it	;	no	,	i	 organize 	 d 	 	it	and	i	 direct 	 ed 	 	it	.
i	did	n't	have	patience	for	my	body	;	i	 snap 	 ped 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	shape	.
i	was	 greed 	 y 	 	.
i	took	more	than	my	body	had	to	 off 	 er 	 	.
if	i	was	 tire 	 d 	 	,	i	 d 	 rank 	 	more	 espresso 	 s 	 	.
if	i	was	 af 	 raid 	 	,	i	went	to	more	 danger 	 ous 	 	 place 	 s 	 	.
oh	 s 	 ure 	 	,	 s 	 ure 	 	,	i	had	 moment 	 s 	 	of	 appreci 	 ation 	 	of	my	body	,	the	way	an	 a 	 bus 	 ive 	 	parent	can	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	have	a	moment	of	 kind 	 ness 	 	.
my	father	was	 re 	 ally 	 	kind	to	me	on	my	16th	 birth 	 day 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
i	heard	people	murmur	from	time	to	time	that	i	should	love	my	body	,	so	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	how	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	was	a	 veget 	 arian 	 	,	i	was	sober	,	i	did	n't	smoke	.
but	all	that	was	just	a	more	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	way	to	 manipul 	 ate 	 	my	body	--	a	further	 dis 	 associ 	 ation 	 	,	like	 plant 	 ing 	 	a	 veget 	 able 	 	field	on	a	 free 	 way 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	me	 talk 	 ing 	 	so	much	about	my	vagina	,	 man 	 y 	 	women	 start 	 ed 	 	to	tell	me	about	 the 	 ir 	 s 	 	--	 the 	 ir 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	about	 the 	 ir 	 	bodies	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	these	 st 	 ories 	 	 compel 	 led 	 	me	around	the	world	,	and	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	to	over	60	 count 	 ries 	 	.
i	heard	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 st 	 ories 	 	,
and	i	have	to	tell	you	,	there	was	 al 	 ways 	 	 th 	 is 	 	moment	where	the	women	 share 	 d 	 	with	me	that	 part 	 icular 	 	moment	when	she	 separat 	 ed 	 	from	her	body	--	when	she	left	home	.
i	heard	about	women	 be 	 ing 	 	 mole 	 s 	 ted 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 bed 	 s 	 	,	 f 	 log 	 ged 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 burqa 	 s 	 	,	left	for	dead	in	 park 	 ing 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	,	acid	 burn 	 ed 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 kitchen 	 s 	 	.
some	women	 be 	 came 	 	quiet	and	 disappear 	 ed 	 	.
other	women	 be 	 came 	 	mad	,	driven	 machine 	 s 	 	like	me	.
in	the	middle	of	my	 travel 	 ing 	 	,	i	 turn 	 ed 	 	40	and	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	hate	my	body	,	which	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	progress	,	 be 	 cause 	 	at	 l 	 east 	 	my	body	 exist 	 ed 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	to	hate	it	.
well	my	stomach	--	it	was	my	stomach	i	 hat 	 ed 	 	.
it	was	proof	that	i	had	not	 measur 	 ed 	 	up	,	that	i	was	old	and	not	fabulous	and	not	perfect	or	able	to	fit	 in 	 to 	 	the	 pre 	 determine 	 d 	 	corporate	image	in	shape	.
my	stomach	was	proof	that	i	had	 fail 	 ed 	 	,	that	it	had	 fail 	 ed 	 	me	,	that	it	was	broken	.
my	life	 be 	 came 	 	about	 get 	 ting 	 	rid	of	it	and	 obsess 	 ing 	 	about	 get 	 ting 	 	rid	of	it	.
in	fact	,	it	 be 	 came 	 	so	 extrem 	 e 	 	i	wrote	a	play	about	it	.
but	the	more	i	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	it	,	the	more	 object 	 ified 	 	and	 fragment 	 ed 	 	my	body	 be 	 came 	 	.
it	 be 	 came 	 	 entertain 	 ment 	 	;	it	 be 	 came 	 	a	new	kind	of	 commodit 	 y 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	i	was	selling	.
then	i	went	 some 	 where 	 	else	.
i	went	 out 	 side 	 	what	i	thought	i	 k 	 new 	 	.
i	went	to	the	 democrat 	 ic 	 	 re 	 public 	 	of	congo	.
and	i	heard	 st 	 ories 	 	that	 shatter 	 ed 	 	all	the	other	 st 	 ories 	 	.
i	heard	 st 	 ories 	 	that	got	 in 	 side 	 	my	body	.
i	heard	about	a	little	girl	who	could	n't	stop	 pe 	 e 	 ing 	 	on	 her 	 self 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	so	 man 	 y 	 	grown	 soldier 	 s 	 	had	 shove 	 d 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 in 	 side 	 	her	.
i	heard	an	80	-	year	-	old	woman	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 leg 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	broken	and	 pull 	 ed 	 	out	of	her	 socket 	 s 	 	and	 twist 	 ed 	 	up	on	her	head	 a 	 s 	 	the	 soldier 	 s 	 	 rap 	 ed 	 	her	like	that	.
there	are	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	these	 st 	 ories 	 	,
and	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	women	had	 hole 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	bodies	--	 hole 	 s 	 	,	 fist 	 ula 	 	--	that	 we 	 re 	 	the	 viol 	 ation 	 	of	war	--	 hole 	 s 	 	in	the	fabric	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 soul 	 s 	 	.
these	 st 	 ories 	 	 saturate 	 d 	 	my	 cell 	 s 	 	and	 nerve 	 s 	 	,
and	to	be	honest	,	i	 stop 	 ped 	 	 sleep 	 ing 	 	for	three	 year 	 s 	 	.
all	the	 st 	 ories 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	to	 ble 	 ed 	 	together	.
the	 rap 	 ing 	 	of	the	earth	,	the	 pill 	 aging 	 	of	 mineral 	 s 	 	,	the	 destruct 	 ion 	 	of	 vagina 	 s 	 	--	 non 	 e 	 	of	these	 we 	 re 	 	 separat 	 e 	 	 any 	 more 	 	from	each	other	or	me	.
militias	 we 	 re 	 	 rap 	 ing 	 	six	-	month	-	old	 bab 	 ies 	 	so	that	 count 	 ries 	 	far	away	could	get	access	to	gold	and	 col 	 tan 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	iphones	and	 computer 	 s 	 	.
my	body	had	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 be 	 come 	 	a	driven	machine	,	but	it	was	 respons 	 ible 	 	now	for	 destroy 	 ing 	 	other	women	's	bodies	in	 it 	 s 	 	mad	quest	to	make	more	 machine 	 s 	 	to	support	the	speed	and	efficiency	of	my	machine	.
then	i	got	cancer	--	or	i	found	out	i	had	cancer	.
it	 arriv 	 ed 	 	like	a	 speed 	 ing 	 	bird	 s 	 mash 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 window 	 pane 	 	.

 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	my	cancer	was	a	cancer	that	was	 every 	 where 	 	,	the	cancer	of	 cruel 	 ty 	 	,	the	cancer	of	greed	,	the	cancer	that	 get 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	people	who	live	down	the	 street 	 s 	 	from	chemical	 plant 	 s 	 	--	and	they	're	 usual 	 ly 	 	poor	--	the	cancer	 in 	 side 	 	the	coal	 min 	 er 	 	's	 lung 	 s 	 	,	the	cancer	of	stress	for	not	 achiev 	 ing 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	the	cancer	of	buried	trauma	,	the	cancer	in	 cage 	 d 	 	 chicken 	 s 	 	and	 pollute 	 d 	 	fish	,	the	cancer	in	women	's	 uterus 	 es 	 	from	 be 	 ing 	 	 rap 	 ed 	 	,	the	cancer	that	is	 every 	 where 	 	from	our	 care 	 lessness 	 	.
in	his	new	and	 vision 	 ary 	 	book	,	``	new	self	,	new	world	,	``	the	writer	philip	shepherd	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	if	you	are	 divid 	 ed 	 	from	your	body	,	you	are	 al 	 so 	 	 divid 	 ed 	 	from	the	body	of	the	world	,	which	then	 appear 	 s 	 	to	be	other	than	you	or	 separat 	 e 	 	from	you	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	the	living	 continu 	 um 	 	to	which	you	belong	.	``	before	cancer	,	the	world	was	 some 	 thing 	 	other	.

and	when	it	 rain 	 s 	 	hard	rain	,	i	 s 	 cream 	 	and	i	run	in	 circle 	 s 	 	.
i	know	that	 every 	 thing 	 	is	 connect 	 ed 	 	,	and	the	scar	that	 run 	 s 	 	the	length	of	my	 tors 	 o 	 	is	the	 mark 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	the	 earth 	 quake 	 	.
and	i	am	there	with	the	three	million	in	the	 street 	 s 	 	of	port	-	au	-	prince	.
and	the	fire	that	 burn 	 ed 	 	in	me	on	day	three	through	six	of	chemo	is	the	fire	that	is	 burn 	 ing 	 	in	the	 forest 	 s 	 	of	the	world	.
