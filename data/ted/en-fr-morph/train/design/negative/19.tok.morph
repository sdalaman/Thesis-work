i	do	n't	know	about	you	,	but	i	have	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	technology	 mean 	 s 	 	in	my	life	.
i	've	 s 	 pent 	 	the	past	year	 think 	 ing 	 	about	what	it	 re 	 ally 	 	should	be	about	.
should	i	be	pro	-	technology	?	should	i	embrace	it	full	 arm 	 s 	 	?
should	i	be	 war 	 y 	 	?	like	you	,	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	 tempt 	 ed 	 	by	the	 lat 	 est 	 	thing	.
but	at	the	other	hand	,	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	i	 g 	 ave 	 	up	all	of	my	 possess 	 ions 	 	,	 s 	 old 	 	all	my	technology	--	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	a	 bi 	 cycle 	 	--	and	 rod 	 e 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	3,000	 mile 	 s 	 	on	the	u.s.	back	 road 	 s 	 	under	the	power	of	my	one	body	,	 fuel 	 led 	 	 most 	 ly 	 	by	twinkies	and	junk	food	.
and	i	've	since	then	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	keep	technology	at	arm	's	length	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	,	so	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	master	my	life	.
at	the	same	time	,	i	run	a	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	on	cool	 tool 	 s 	 	,	where	i	issue	a	 dai 	 ly 	 	obsession	of	the	 lat 	 est 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	in	technology	.	so	i	'm	still	 per 	 plex 	 ed 	 	about	what	the	true	meaning	of	technology	is	 a 	 s 	 	it	 relat 	 es 	 	to	 human 	 ity 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 relat 	 es 	 	to	nature	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 relat 	 es 	 	to	the	spiritual	.
and	i	'm	not	even	 s 	 ure 	 	we	know	what	technology	is	.
and	one	definition	of	technology	is	that	which	is	first	 record 	 ed 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	the	modern	use	of	technology	that	i	can	find	.
it	was	the	 suggest 	 ed 	 	syllabus	for	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	the	 appli 	 ed 	 	 art 	 s 	 	and	science	at	cambridge	university	in	1829	.
before	that	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	technology	did	n't	exist	.	but	 obvious 	 ly 	 	it	did	.
i	like	one	of	the	 definition 	 s 	 	that	alan	kay	 ha 	 s 	 	for	technology	.
he	 say 	 s 	 	technology	is	 any 	 thing 	 	that	was	 invent 	 ed 	 	after	you	 we 	 re 	 	born	.
so	it	 sum 	 s 	 	up	a	lot	of	what	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	.
danny	hillis	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	an	update	on	that	--
he	 say 	 s 	 	technology	is	 any 	 thing 	 	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	work	yet	.
which	 al 	 so 	 	,	i	think	,	 get 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	little	bit	of	our	current	idea	.
but	i	was	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 an 	 other 	 	definition	of	technology	.
 some 	 thing 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	that	went	back	to	 some 	 thing 	 	more	fundamental	.
 some 	 thing 	 	that	was	 deep 	 er 	 	.	and	 a 	 s 	 	i	 struggle 	 d 	 	to	understand	that	,	i	came	up	with	a	way	of	framing	the	question	that	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	work	for	me	in	my	 investigation 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'm	,	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	going	to	talk	about	 th 	 is 	 	for	the	first	time	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	rough	attempt	to	think	out	loud	.
the	question	that	i	came	up	with	was	 th 	 is 	 	question	:	what	 do 	 es 	 	technology	want	?	and	by	that	,	i	do	n't	mean	,	 do 	 es 	 	it	want	chocolate	or	 van 	 illa 	 	?	by	what	it	 want 	 s 	 	,	i	mean	,	what	are	 it 	 s 	 	inherent	 trend 	 s 	 	and	 bias 	 es 	 	?
what	are	 it 	 s 	 	 tend 	 encies 	 	over	time	?	one	way	to	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 bio 	 logical 	 	 organism 	 s 	 	,	which	we	've	heard	a	lot	about	.
and	the	trick	that	richard	dawkins	 do 	 es 	 	,	which	is	to	say	,	to	look	at	them	 a 	 s 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 gene 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 vehicle 	 s 	 	for	 gene 	 s 	 	.
so	he	's	 say 	 ing 	 	,	what	do	 gene 	 s 	 	want	?	the	 self 	 ish 	 	gene	.
and	i	'm	 app 	 ly 	 ing 	 	a	similar	trick	to	say	,	what	if	we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	in	our	culture	through	the	 eye 	 s 	 	of	technology	?	what	 do 	 es 	 	technology	want	?
 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	in	an	 in 	 complete 	 	question	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	looking	at	an	organism	 a 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	a	gene	is	an	 in 	 complete 	 	way	of	looking	at	it	.
but	it	's	still	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	productive	.	so	i	'm	 attempt 	 ing 	 	to	say	,	if	we	take	technology	's	view	of	the	world	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	it	want	?
and	i	think	once	we	ask	that	question	we	have	to	go	back	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	to	life	.	 be 	 cause 	 	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	if	we	keep	 extend 	 ing 	 	the	 origin 	 s 	 	of	technology	far	back	,	i	think	we	come	back	to	life	at	some	point	.
so	that	's	where	i	want	to	begin	my	little	exploration	,	is	in	life	.
and	like	you	heard	from	the	previous	 speaker 	 s 	 	,	we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	know	what	life	there	is	on	earth	right	now	.
we	have	 re 	 ally 	 	no	idea	.
craig	venter	's	tremendous	and	 brilli 	 ant 	 	attempt	to	dna	sequence	 thing 	 s 	 	in	the	ocean	is	great	.
brian	farrell	's	work	is	all	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	agenda	to	try	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	discover	all	the	species	on	earth	.
and	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	should	do	is	just	make	a	grid	of	the	 glob 	 e 	 	and	 random 	 ly 	 	go	and	inspect	all	the	 place 	 s 	 	that	the	grid	intersects	,	just	to	see	what	's	on	life	.	and	if	we	did	that	with	our	little	martian	 prob 	 e 	 	,	which	we	have	not	 d 	 one 	 	on	earth	,	we	would	begin	to	see	some	 in 	 credible 	 	species	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	on	 an 	 other 	 	planet	.	these	are	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 hid 	 den 	 	away	on	our	planet	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	ant	that	 store 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	'	honey	in	 it 	 s 	 	abdomen	.
each	one	of	these	 organism 	 s 	 	that	we	've	 de 	 scribed 	 	--	that	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	from	jamie	and	 other 	 s 	 	,	these	 magnific 	 ent 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	--	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	,	each	one	of	them	,	is	they	're	 hack 	 ing 	 	the	 rule 	 s 	 	of	life	.
i	ca	n't	think	of	a	single	general	principle	of	biology	that	 do 	 es 	 	not	have	an	exception	 some 	 where 	 	by	some	organism	.
every	single	thing	that	we	can	think	of	--	and	if	you	heard	olivia	's	talk	about	the	sexual	 habit 	 s 	 	,	you	'll	 real 	 ize 	 	that	there	is	n't	 any 	 thing 	 	we	can	say	that	's	true	for	all	life	,
 be 	 cause 	 	every	single	one	of	them	is	 hack 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	about	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	solar	-	powered	sea	slug	.	it	's	a	nudibranch	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 incorpo 	 rated 	 	chloroplast	 in 	 side 	 	it	to	drive	 it 	 s 	 	energy	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	version	of	that	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	sea	dragon	,	and	the	one	on	the	bottom	,	the	blue	one	,	is	a	juvenile	that	 ha 	 s 	 	not	yet	 swallow 	 ed 	 	the	acid	,	 ha 	 s 	 	not	yet	taken	in	the	 brow 	 n 	 	-	green	 al 	 ga 	 e 	 	pond	 s 	 cum 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 it 	 s 	 	body	to	give	it	energy	.
these	are	 hack 	 s 	 	,	and	if	we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	general	shape	of	the	 approach 	 es 	 	to	 hack 	 ing 	 	life	there	are	,	current	 con 	 sens 	 us 	 	,	six	 king 	 dom 	 s 	 	.	six	different	broad	 approach 	 es 	 	:	the	 plant 	 s 	 	,	the	 animal 	 s 	 	,	the	fungi	,	the	 protest 	 s 	 	--	the	little	 thing 	 s 	 	--	the	bacteria	and	the	 arch 	 aea 	 	bacteria	.	the	archaeas	.
 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	general	 approach 	 es 	 	to	life	.	that	's	one	way	to	look	at	life	on	earth	 to 	 day 	 	.
but	a	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	way	,	the	current	way	to	take	the	long	view	,	is	to	look	at	it	in	an	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	.
and	here	we	have	a	view	of	evolution	where	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 hav 	 ing 	 	evolution	go	over	the	linear	time	,	we	have	it	coming	out	from	the	center	.
so	in	the	center	is	the	most	primitive	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 genea 	 logical 	 	chart	of	all	life	on	earth	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	the	same	six	 king 	 dom 	 s 	 	.
you	see	4,000	 represent 	 ative 	 	species	,	and	you	can	see	where	we	are	.
but	what	i	like	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	it	 show 	 s 	 	that	every	living	organism	on	earth	 to 	 day 	 	is	 equal 	 ly 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	fungi	and	bacteria	are	 a 	 s 	 	 high 	 ly 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 human 	 s 	 	.
they	've	 be 	 en 	 	around	just	 a 	 s 	 	long	and	gone	through	just	the	same	kind	of	trial	and	error	to	get	here	.
but	we	see	that	each	one	of	these	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 hack 	 ing 	 	,	and	 ha 	 s 	 	a	different	way	of	 find 	 ing 	 	out	how	to	do	life	.
and	if	we	take	the	long	-	term	 trend 	 s 	 	of	life	,	if	we	begin	to	say	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	evolution	want	?	there	's	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	see	.
one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	about	evolution	is	that	 no 	 where 	 	on	earth	have	we	ever	 be 	 en 	 	where	we	do	n't	find	life	.
we	find	life	at	the	bottom	of	every	long	-	term	,	long	-	distance	 drill 	 ing 	 	core	 in 	 to 	 	the	center	of	rock	that	we	 br 	 ing 	 	up	--	and	there	's	bacteria	in	the	 pore 	 s 	 	of	that	rock	.
and	 where 	 ver 	 	life	is	,	it	never	 re 	 treat 	 s 	 	.	it	's	 ubiqu 	 it 	 ous 	 	and	it	 want 	 s 	 	to	be	more	.
more	and	more	of	the	 in 	 ert 	 	matter	of	the	 glob 	 e 	 	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 touch 	 ed 	 	and	 animate 	 d 	 	by	life	.
the	second	thing	is	is	we	see	 divers 	 ity 	 	.	we	 al 	 so 	 	see	 special 	 ization 	 	.
we	see	the	 move 	 ment 	 	from	a	general	-	purpose	cell	to	the	more	specific	and	 special 	 ized 	 	.
and	we	see	a	drift	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 complex 	 ity 	 	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	intuitive	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	we	have	current	data	that	 do 	 es 	 	show	that	there	is	an	actual	drift	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 complex 	 ity 	 	over	time	.
and	the	last	thing	,	i	 br 	 ing 	 	back	 th 	 is 	 	nudibranch	.
one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	see	about	life	is	that	it	 move 	 s 	 	from	the	inner	to	increasing	sociability	.	and	by	that	it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	there	is	more	and	more	of	life	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	entire	environment	is	other	life	.
like	 t 	 hose 	 	chloroplast	 cell 	 s 	 	--	they	're	 complete 	 ly 	 	 surround 	 ed 	 	by	other	life	.
they	never	touch	the	inner	matter	.	there	is	more	and	more	co	-	evolution	.
and	so	the	general	,	long	-	term	 trend 	 s 	 	of	evolution	are	 rough 	 ly 	 	these	five	:	 ubiqu 	 ity 	 	,	 divers 	 ity 	 	,	 special 	 ization 	 	,	 complex 	 ity 	 	and	 social 	 ization 	 	.	now	,	i	took	that	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	ok	,	what	are	the	long	-	term	 trend 	 s 	 	in	technology	?	and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	my	question	is	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	technology	want	?	and	so	,	 remark 	 ably 	 	,	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	there	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	drift	 to 	 ward 	 	 special 	 ization 	 	.
that	we	see	there	's	a	general	hammer	,	and	 hammer 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	more	and	more	specific	over	time	.
there	's	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 divers 	 ity 	 	.	huge	 number 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	all	the	 content 	 s 	 	of	a	japanese	home	.
i	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	my	daughter	--	 g 	 ave 	 	her	a	 t 	 ally 	 	counter	,	and	i	 g 	 ave 	 	her	an	 assign 	 ment 	 	last	summer	to	go	around	and	count	the	number	of	species	of	technology	in	our	 house 	 hold 	 	.
and	it	came	up	with	6,000	different	species	of	 product 	 s 	 	.
i	did	some	research	and	found	out	that	the	king	of	england	,	henry	viii	,	had	 on 	 ly 	 	about	7,000	 item 	 s 	 	in	his	 house 	 hold 	 	.
and	he	was	the	king	of	england	,	and	that	was	the	entire	wealth	of	england	at	the	time	.
so	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	huge	 number 	 s 	 	of	 divers 	 ity 	 	in	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	scene	from	star	 war 	 s 	 	where	the	3po	 come 	 s 	 	out	and	he	 s 	 ees 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	making	 machine 	 s 	 	.	how	depraved	!
well	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	what	we	're	headed	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	:	world	 machine 	 s 	 	.
and	the	technology	is	 on 	 ly 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 throw 	 n 	 	out	by	other	 techno 	 logies 	 	.
most	 machine 	 s 	 	will	 on 	 ly 	 	ever	be	in	contact	with	other	technology	and	not	non	-	technology	,	or	even	life	.
and	 third 	 ly 	 	,	the	idea	that	 machine 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 coming 	 	 bio 	 logical 	 	and	complex	is	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	a	cliche	.	and	i	'm	happy	to	say	,	i	was	 part 	 ly 	 	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	that	cliche	that	 machine 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 coming 	 	 bio 	 logical 	 	,	but	that	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	evident	.
so	the	major	 trend 	 s 	 	in	technology	evolution	 actual 	 ly 	 	are	the	same	 a 	 s 	 	in	 bio 	 logical 	 	evolution	.	the	same	 drive 	 s 	 	that	we	see	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 ubiqu 	 ity 	 	,	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 divers 	 ity 	 	,	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 social 	 ization 	 	,	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 complex 	 ity 	 	.	that	is	 may 	 be 	 	not	a	big	surprise	 be 	 cause 	 	if	we	map	out	,	say	,	the	evolution	of	 arm 	 or 	 	,	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	follow	a	sort	of	an	 evolution 	 ary 	 	-	type	cladistic	tree	.
i	suggest	that	,	in	fact	,	technology	is	the	 seven 	 th 	 	 king 	 dom 	 	of	life	.
that	 it 	 s 	 	 operation 	 s 	 	and	how	it	 work 	 s 	 	is	so	similar	that	we	can	think	of	it	 a 	 s 	 	the	 seven 	 th 	 	 king 	 dom 	 	.
and	so	it	would	be	sort	of	 approximate 	 ly 	 	up	there	,	coming	out	of	the	animal	 king 	 dom 	 	.	and	if	we	 we 	 re 	 	to	do	that	,	we	would	find	out	--	we	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	approach	technology	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	niles	eldredge	.	he	was	the	co	-	 develop 	 er 	 	with	stephen	jay	gould	of	the	 theor 	 y 	 	of	 punctu 	 ated 	 	equilibrium	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	a	 side 	 line 	 	,	he	 happen 	 s 	 	to	collect	cornets	.
he	 ha 	 s 	 	one	of	the	world	's	largest	 collect 	 ions 	 	--	about	500	of	them	.
and	he	 ha 	 s 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	to	treat	them	 a 	 s 	 	if	they	 we 	 re 	 	 tri 	 lob 	 ites 	 	,	or	 s 	 nail 	 s 	 	,	and	to	do	a	 morpho 	 logical 	 	analysis	,	and	try	to	 der 	 ive 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 genea 	 logical 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	over	time	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	his	chart	,	which	is	not	 quit 	 e 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	yet	.
but	the	most	 interest 	 ing 	 	 a 	 spect 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	if	you	look	at	 t 	 hose 	 	red	lines	at	the	bottom	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 indic 	 ate 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	a	 parent 	 age 	 	of	a	type	of	cornet	that	was	no	 long 	 er 	 	made	.	that	 do 	 es 	 	not	happen	in	biology	.
when	 some 	 thing 	 	is	extinct	,	you	ca	n't	have	it	 a 	 s 	 	your	parent	.
but	that	 do 	 es 	 	happen	in	technology	.	and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	that	's	so	 distinct 	 ive 	 	that	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	tree	,	and	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	use	it	to	determine	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 techno 	 logical 	 	system	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	a	 bio 	 logical 	 	system	.
in	fact	,	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	resurrecting	the	whole	idea	is	so	 import 	 ant 	 	that	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	think	about	what	 happen 	 s 	 	with	old	technology	.
and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	,	in	fact	,	 techno 	 logies 	 	do	n't	die	.
so	i	 suggest 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	to	an	historian	of	science	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	what	about	,	you	know	,	come	on	,	what	about	 s 	 team 	 	 car 	 s 	 	?
they	're	not	around	 any 	 more 	 	.	``	well	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	they	are	.
in	fact	,	they	're	so	around	that	you	can	buy	new	 part 	 s 	 	for	a	stanley	 s 	 team 	 	 auto 	 mobile 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	of	a	guy	who	's	selling	brand	new	 part 	 s 	 	for	the	stanley	 auto 	 mobile 	 	.	and	the	thing	that	i	 like 	 d 	 	is	sort	of	 th 	 is 	 	one	-	click	,	add	-	to	-	your	-	cart	button	--	--	for	 buy 	 ing 	 	 s 	 team 	 	 val 	 ves 	 	.	i	mean	,	it	was	just	--	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	there	.
and	so	,	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	think	about	,	well	,	 may 	 be 	 	that	's	just	a	random	 s 	 ample 	 	.
 may 	 be 	 	i	should	do	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	in	a	more	 conserv 	 ative 	 	way	.
so	i	took	the	great	big	1895	montgomery	ward	's	catalog	and	i	 random 	 ly 	 	went	through	it	.	and	i	took	a	page	--	not	 quit 	 e 	 	a	random	page	--	i	took	a	page	that	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	more	difficult	than	 other 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	the	 page 	 s 	 	are	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	still	 be 	 ing 	 	made	.	but	i	took	 th 	 is 	 	page	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	still	 be 	 ing 	 	made	?	and	not	 anti 	 que 	 s 	 	.	i	want	to	know	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	still	in	production	.
and	the	answer	is	:	all	of	them	.
all	of	them	are	still	 be 	 ing 	 	 produce 	 d 	 	.	so	you	've	got	corn	shellers	.
i	do	n't	know	who	 need 	 s 	 	a	corn	sheller	.
be	it	corn	shellers	--	you	've	got	ploughs	;	you	've	got	fan	 mill 	 s 	 	;	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	--	and	these	are	not	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 anti 	 que 	 s 	 	.	these	are	--	you	can	order	these	.	you	can	go	to	the	web	and	you	can	buy	them	now	,	brand	-	new	made	.	so	in	a	certain	sense	,	 techno 	 logies 	 	do	n't	die	.
in	fact	,	you	can	buy	,	for	50	 buck 	 s 	 	,	a	stone	-	age	knife	made	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	way	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	made	10,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
it	's	short	,	bone	handle	,	50	 buck 	 s 	 	.	and	in	fact	,	what	's	 import 	 ant 	 	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	information	 actual 	 ly 	 	never	 di 	 ed 	 	out	.
it	's	not	just	that	it	was	 resurrect 	 ed 	 	.	it	's	 continu 	 ed 	 	all	 a 	 long 	 	.
and	in	papua	new	guinea	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	making	stone	 axe 	 s 	 	 un 	 til 	 	two	 decade 	 s 	 	ago	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	a	course	of	practical	 matter 	 s 	 	.
even	when	we	try	to	get	rid	of	a	technology	,	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	.
so	we	've	all	heard	about	the	amish	giving	up	 car 	 s 	 	.
we	've	heard	about	the	japanese	giving	up	 gun 	 s 	 	.
we	've	heard	about	 th 	 is 	 	and	that	.	but	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	went	back	and	took	what	i	could	find	,	the	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	where	there	have	 be 	 en 	 	 prohibit 	 ions 	 	against	technology	,	and	then	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	find	out	when	they	came	back	in	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 al 	 ways 	 	came	back	in	.	and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	the	time	,	the	 dur 	 ation 	 	of	when	they	 we 	 re 	 	 out 	 law 	 ed 	 	and	 prohibit 	 ed 	 	,	is	 decr 	 eas 	 ing 	 	over	time	.	and	that	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	you	can	delay	technology	,	but	you	ca	n't	kill	it	.	so	 th 	 is 	 	 make 	 s 	 	sense	,	 be 	 cause 	 	in	a	certain	sense	what	culture	is	,	is	the	 accumul 	 ation 	 	of	 idea 	 s 	 	.
that	's	what	it	's	for	.	it	's	so	that	 idea 	 s 	 	do	n't	die	out	.
and	when	we	take	that	,	we	take	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	what	culture	is	 do 	 ing 	 	and	add	it	to	what	the	long	-	term	 tra 	 ject 	 ory 	 	--	 aga 	 in 	 	,	in	life	's	evolution	--	we	find	that	each	case	--	each	of	the	major	 transit 	 ions 	 	in	life	--	what	they	're	 re 	 ally 	 	about	is	 accele 	 rating 	 	and	changing	the	way	in	which	evolution	 happen 	 s 	 	.
they	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	changing	the	way	in	which	 idea 	 s 	 	are	generated	.
so	all	these	 step 	 s 	 	in	evolution	are	increasing	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	the	evolution	of	 evolv 	 ability 	 	.
so	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	over	time	in	life	is	that	the	ways	in	which	you	generate	these	new	 idea 	 s 	 	,	these	new	 hack 	 s 	 	,	are	increasing	.	and	the	real	 trick 	 s 	 	are	ways	in	which	you	kind	of	explore	the	way	of	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	.
and	then	what	we	see	in	the	 s 	 ing 	 ular 	 ity 	 	,	that	prophesized	by	kurzweil	and	 other 	 s 	 	--	his	idea	that	technology	is	 accele 	 rating 	 	evolution	.
it	's	 accele 	 rating 	 	the	way	in	which	we	search	for	 idea 	 s 	 	.
so	if	you	have	life	 hack 	 ing 	 	--	life	 mean 	 s 	 	 hack 	 ing 	 	,	the	game	of	 surviv 	 al 	 	--	then	evolution	is	a	way	to	extend	the	game	by	changing	the	 rule 	 s 	 	of	the	game	.
and	what	technology	is	 re 	 ally 	 	about	is	better	ways	to	evolve	.
that	is	what	we	call	an	``	infinite	game	.	``
that	's	the	definition	of	``	infinite	game	.	``	a	 fin 	 ite 	 	game	is	play	to	win	,	and	an	infinite	game	is	 play 	 ed 	 	to	keep	 play 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	technology	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 cosm 	 ic 	 	force	.
the	 origin 	 s 	 	of	technology	was	not	in	1829	,	but	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	big	bang	,	and	at	that	moment	the	entire	huge	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 star 	 s 	 	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 compress 	 ed 	 	.	the	entire	 uni 	 verse 	 	was	 compress 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	little	 quant 	 um 	 	dot	,	and	it	was	so	tight	in	there	,	there	was	no	room	for	any	 differ 	 ence 	 	at	all	.
that	's	the	definition	.	there	was	no	temperature	.
there	was	no	 differ 	 ence 	 	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	.	and	at	the	big	bang	,	what	it	 expand 	 ed 	 	was	the	potential	for	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	it	 expand 	 s 	 	and	 a 	 s 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	expand	what	we	have	is	the	potential	for	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	,	 divers 	 ity 	 	,	 option 	 s 	 	,	 choice 	 s 	 	,	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	,	 possibil 	 ities 	 	and	 free 	 dom 	 s 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	are	all	 bas 	 ically 	 	the	same	thing	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	technology	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	us	.
that	's	what	technology	is	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	us	:	 choice 	 s 	 	,	 possibil 	 ities 	 	,	 free 	 dom 	 s 	 	.
that	's	what	it	's	about	.	it	's	 th 	 is 	 	expansion	of	room	to	make	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	.
and	so	a	hammer	,	when	we	grab	a	hammer	,	that	's	what	we	're	 grab 	 bing 	 	.
and	that	's	why	we	 continu 	 e 	 	to	grab	technology	--	 be 	 cause 	 	we	want	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	are	good	.
 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	,	 free 	 dom 	 	,	 choice 	 s 	 	,	 possibil 	 ities 	 	.
and	each	time	we	make	a	new	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	place	,	we	're	 allow 	 ing 	 	a	platform	to	make	new	 one 	 s 	 	.
and	i	think	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.	 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	can	imagine	mozart	before	the	technology	of	the	piano	was	 invent 	 ed 	 	--	what	a	loss	to	 socie 	 ty 	 	there	would	be	.
imagine	van	gogh	 be 	 ing 	 	born	before	the	 techno 	 logies 	 	of	cheap	oil	 paint 	 s 	 	.
imagine	hitchcock	before	the	 techno 	 logies 	 	of	film	.
 some 	 where 	 	,	 to 	 day 	 	,	there	are	 million 	 s 	 	of	young	children	 be 	 ing 	 	born	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	technology	of	self	-	 express 	 ion 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	not	yet	 be 	 en 	 	 invent 	 ed 	 	.
we	have	a	moral	 oblig 	 ation 	 	to	invent	technology	so	that	every	person	on	the	 glob 	 e 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	the	potential	to	 real 	 ize 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	true	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
we	want	a	trillion	zillion	species	of	one	 individual 	 s 	 	.
that	's	what	technology	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	skip	through	some	of	the	 object 	 ions 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	do	n't	have	 answer 	 s 	 	to	why	there	's	 de 	 forest 	 ation 	 	.	i	do	n't	have	an	answer	to	the	fact	that	there	seem	to	be	bad	 techno 	 logies 	 	.	i	do	n't	have	an	answer	to	how	 th 	 is 	 	 impact 	 s 	 	on	our	dignity	,	other	than	to	suggest	that	 may 	 be 	 	the	 seven 	 th 	 	 king 	 dom 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	so	close	to	what	life	is	about	,	 may 	 be 	 	we	can	 br 	 ing 	 	it	back	and	have	it	help	us	monitor	life	.
 may 	 be 	 	in	some	ways	the	fact	that	what	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	technology	is	find	a	good	home	for	it	.
it	's	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	thing	to	spray	ddt	on	cotton	 field 	 s 	 	,	but	it	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	good	thing	to	use	to	eliminate	 million 	 s 	 	of	 case 	 s 	 	of	death	due	to	malaria	in	a	small	village	.
our	 human 	 ity 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	defined	by	technology	.
all	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	think	that	we	 re 	 ally 	 	like	about	 human 	 ity 	 	is	 be 	 ing 	 	driven	by	technology	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	infinite	game	.
that	's	what	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	.
you	see	,	technology	is	a	way	to	evolve	the	evolution	.
it	's	a	way	to	explore	 possibil 	 ities 	 	and	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	and	create	more	.
and	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	way	of	 play 	 ing 	 	the	game	,	of	 play 	 ing 	 	all	the	 game 	 s 	 	.
that	's	what	technology	 want 	 s 	 	.
and	so	when	i	think	about	what	technology	 want 	 s 	 	,	i	think	that	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	with	the	fact	that	every	person	here	--	and	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	--	every	person	here	 ha 	 s 	 	an	 assign 	 ment 	 	.	and	your	 assign 	 ment 	 	is	to	 s 	 pend 	 	your	life	 discover 	 ing 	 	what	your	 assign 	 ment 	 	is	.
that	 recur 	 s 	 ive 	 	nature	is	the	infinite	game	.
and	if	you	play	that	well	,	you	'll	have	other	people	 involve 	 d 	 	,	so	even	that	game	 extend 	 s 	 	and	 continu 	 es 	 	even	when	you	're	gone	.
that	is	the	infinite	game	.	and	what	technology	is	is	the	medium	in	which	we	play	that	infinite	game	.
and	so	i	think	that	we	should	embrace	technology	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	an	essential	part	of	our	journey	in	 find 	 ing 	 	out	who	we	are	.
thank	you	.
