what	i	want	to	talk	about	is	,	 a 	 s 	 	 back 	 ground 	 	,	is	the	idea	that	 car 	 s 	 	are	art	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 meaning 	 ful 	 	to	me	,	 be 	 cause 	 	car	 design 	 ers 	 	tend	to	be	a	little	bit	low	on	the	totem	pole	--	we	do	n't	do	coffee	table	 book 	 s 	 	with	just	one	lamp	 in 	 side 	 	of	it	--	and	 car 	 s 	 	are	thought	so	much	 a 	 s 	 	a	product	that	it	's	a	little	bit	difficult	to	get	 in 	 to 	 	the	aesthetic	side	under	the	same	sort	of	 term 	 in 	 ology 	 	that	one	would	discuss	art	.
and	so	 car 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	art	,	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	an	 emotion 	 al 	 	plane	--	if	you	accept	that	--	that	you	have	to	deal	with	on	the	same	level	you	would	with	art	with	a	capital	a	.
now	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	you	're	going	to	see	a	picture	of	michelangelo	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	than	 auto 	 mobile 	 s 	 	.
 auto 	 mobile 	 s 	 	are	self	-	moving	 thing 	 s 	 	,	right	?	 elev 	 ators 	 	are	 auto 	 mobile 	 s 	 	.
and	they	're	not	 ver 	 y 	 	 emotion 	 al 	 	;	they	solve	a	purpose	;	and	 certain 	 ly 	 	 auto 	 mobile 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	around	for	100	 year 	 s 	 	and	have	made	our	 live 	 s 	 	 functional 	 ly 	 	a	lot	better	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	;	they	've	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	real	pain	in	the	ass	,
 be 	 cause 	 	 auto 	 mobile 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	the	thing	we	have	to	solve	.
we	have	to	solve	the	 poll 	 ution 	 	,	we	have	to	solve	the	 con 	 gest 	 ion 	 	--	but	that	's	not	what	 interest 	 s 	 	me	in	 th 	 is 	 	speech	.
what	 interest 	 s 	 	me	in	 th 	 is 	 	speech	is	 car 	 s 	 	.	 auto 	 mobile 	 s 	 	may	be	what	you	use	,	but	 car 	 s 	 	are	what	we	are	,	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	we	can	solve	the	 problem 	 s 	 	of	 auto 	 mobile 	 s 	 	,	and	i	 believ 	 e 	 	we	can	,	with	fuel	 cell 	 s 	 	or	hydrogen	,	like	bmw	is	 re 	 ally 	 	hip	on	,	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	other	 thing 	 s 	 	,	then	i	think	we	can	look	past	that	and	try	and	understand	why	 th 	 is 	 	hook	is	in	 man 	 y 	 	of	us	--	of	 th 	 is 	 	car	-	y	-	ness	--	and	what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	,	what	we	can	learn	from	it	.
that	's	what	i	want	to	get	to	.	 car 	 s 	 	are	not	a	suit	of	 clothe 	 s 	 	;	 car 	 s 	 	are	an	avatar	.	 car 	 s 	 	are	an	expansion	of	 your 	 self 	 	:	they	take	your	 thought 	 s 	 	,	your	 idea 	 s 	 	,	your	 emotion 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 multi 	 ply 	 	it	--	your	anger	,	 what 	 ever 	 	.	it	's	an	avatar	.
it	's	a	super	-	waldo	that	you	happen	to	be	 in 	 side 	 	of	,	and	if	you	feel	sexy	,	the	car	is	sexy	.	and	if	you	're	full	of	road	rage	,	you	've	got	a	``	chevy	:	like	a	rock	,	``	right	?
 car 	 s 	 	are	a	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	--	did	you	know	 th 	 is 	 	?
that	every	car	you	see	out	there	is	 sculpt 	 ed 	 	by	hand	.
 man 	 y 	 	people	think	,	``	well	,	it	's	 computer 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	 d 	 one 	 	by	 machine 	 s 	 	and	stuff	like	that	.	``
well	,	they	 re 	 produce 	 	it	,	but	the	 original 	 s 	 	are	all	 d 	 one 	 	by	hand	.
it	's	 d 	 one 	 	by	men	and	women	who	 believ 	 e 	 	a	lot	in	 the 	 ir 	 	craft	.
and	they	put	that	same	kind	of	tension	 in 	 to 	 	the	 sculpt 	 ing 	 	of	a	car	that	you	do	in	a	great	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	that	you	would	go	and	look	at	in	a	museum	.
that	tension	between	the	need	to	express	,	the	need	to	discover	,	then	you	put	 some 	 thing 	 	new	 in 	 to 	 	it	,	and	at	the	same	time	you	have	 bound 	 s 	 	of	 craft 	 s 	 man 	 ship 	 	.
 rule 	 s 	 	that	say	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	you	handle	 surface 	 s 	 	;	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	control	is	all	about	;	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	you	show	you	're	a	master	of	your	craft	.
and	that	tension	,	that	 discover 	 y 	 	,	that	push	for	 some 	 thing 	 	new	--	and	at	the	same	time	,	that	sense	of	 oblig 	 ation 	 	to	the	 regard 	 s 	 	of	 craft 	 s 	 man 	 ship 	 	--	that	's	 a 	 s 	 	strong	in	 car 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	in	 any 	 thing 	 	.
we	work	in	clay	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 change 	 d 	 	much	since	michelangelo	 start 	 ed 	 	 screw 	 ing 	 	around	with	it	,	and	there	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 analog 	 y 	 	to	that	too	.
real	 quick 	 ly 	 	--	michelangelo	once	 s 	 aid 	 	he	's	there	to	``	discover	the	figure	 with 	 in 	 	,	``	ok	?
there	we	go	,	the	 auto 	 mobile 	 	.
that	was	100	 year 	 s 	 	right	there	--	did	you	catch	that	?
between	that	one	there	,	and	that	one	there	,	it	 change 	 d 	 	a	lot	did	n't	it	?
ok	,	it	's	not	 market 	 ing 	 	;	there	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	car	 con 	 cept 	 	here	,	but	the	 market 	 ing 	 	part	is	not	what	i	want	to	talk	about	here	.
i	want	to	talk	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
why	it	 mean 	 s 	 	you	have	to	wash	a	car	,	what	is	it	,	that	 sensual 	 ity 	 	you	have	to	touch	about	it	?	that	's	the	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	that	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	it	.	that	 sensual 	 ity 	 	.
and	it	's	 d 	 one 	 	by	men	and	women	 work 	 ing 	 	just	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	making	 car 	 s 	 	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	little	quote	about	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	from	henry	moore	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	that	that	``	pressure	 with 	 in 	 	``	that	moore	's	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	--	at	 l 	 east 	 	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	 car 	 s 	 	--	 come 	 s 	 	right	back	to	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	the	mean	.
it	's	that	will	to	live	,	that	need	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	,	to	express	 it 	 self 	 	,	that	 come 	 s 	 	in	a	car	,	and	 take 	 s 	 	over	people	like	me	.
and	we	tell	other	people	,	``	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	``	 un 	 til 	 	 th 	 is 	 	thing	 come 	 s 	 	 al 	 ive 	 	.
we	are	 complete 	 ly 	 	 infect 	 ed 	 	.	and	 beaut 	 y 	 	can	be	the	result	of	 th 	 is 	 	 infect 	 ious 	 ness 	 	;	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	is	,	of	course	,	at	the	heart	of	all	of	it	,	and	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	what	 put 	 s 	 	the	 craft 	 s 	 man 	 ship 	 	 in 	 to 	 	our	 car 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	not	a	whole	lot	different	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	when	they	're	 work 	 ing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	or	when	 some 	 body 	 	 work 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	's	that	same	kind	of	 commit 	 ment 	 	,	that	same	kind	of	 beaut 	 y 	 	.
now	,	now	i	get	to	the	point	.	i	want	to	talk	about	 car 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	art	.
art	,	in	the	 plat 	 on 	 ic 	 	sense	,	is	truth	;	it	's	 beaut 	 y 	 	,	and	love	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	where	 design 	 ers 	 	in	car	business	diverge	from	the	 engineer 	 s 	 	.
we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	have	a	problem	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	love	.
we	do	n't	have	a	problem	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	truth	or	 beaut 	 y 	 	in	that	sense	.
that	's	what	we	're	 search 	 ing 	 	for	--	when	we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	our	craft	,	we	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	find	that	truth	out	there	.
we	're	not	 try 	 ing 	 	to	find	 van 	 ity 	 	and	 beaut 	 y 	 	.
we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	find	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	in	the	truth	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	 engineer 	 s 	 	tend	to	look	at	 thing 	 s 	 	a	little	bit	more	newtonian	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 quant 	 um 	 	approach	.
we	're	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	 irrational 	 ism 	 s 	 	,	and	we	're	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	 paradox 	 es 	 	that	we	admit	exist	,	and	the	 engineer 	 s 	 	tend	to	look	 thing 	 s 	 	a	little	bit	more	like	two	and	two	is	four	,	and	if	you	get	4.0	it	's	better	,	and	4.000	is	even	better	.
and	that	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 lead 	 s 	 	to	bit	of	a	 diverge 	 nce 	 	in	why	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	.
we	've	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 accept 	 ed 	 	the	fact	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	that	we	are	the	women	in	the	 organ 	 ization 	 	at	bmw	--	bmw	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 man 	 ly 	 	type	business	,	--	men	,	men	,	men	;	it	's	 engineer 	 s 	 	.
and	we	're	kind	of	the	female	side	to	that	.	that	's	ok	,	that	's	cool	.	you	go	off	and	be	 man 	 ly 	 	.	we	're	going	to	be	a	little	bit	more	female	.
 be 	 cause 	 	what	we	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	is	 find 	 ing 	 	form	that	's	more	than	just	a	function	.
we	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 find 	 ing 	 	 beaut 	 y 	 	that	's	more	than	just	an	aesthetic	;	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	a	truth	.
and	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	soul	,	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	at	the	heart	of	great	 car 	 s 	 	,	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 appli 	 cable 	 	.	you	all	know	it	.	you	know	a	car	when	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	it	,	with	soul	.	you	know	how	strong	 th 	 is 	 	is	.
well	,	 th 	 is 	 	experience	of	love	,	and	the	experience	of	design	,	to	me	,	are	 inter 	 change 	 able 	 	.	and	now	i	'm	coming	to	my	story	.
i	 discover 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	about	love	and	design	through	a	project	 call 	 ed 	 	deep	blue	.
and	first	of	all	,	you	have	to	go	with	me	for	a	second	,	and	say	,	you	know	,	you	could	take	the	word	``	love	``	out	of	a	lot	of	 thing 	 s 	 	in	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	put	the	word	``	design	``	in	,	and	it	still	 work 	 s 	 	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	quote	here	,	you	know	.	it	kind	of	 work 	 s 	 	,	you	know	?
you	can	understand	that	.	it	 work 	 s 	 	in	 truism 	 s 	 	.
``	all	is	fair	in	design	and	war	.	``
 certain 	 ly 	 	we	live	in	a	competitive	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
i	think	 th 	 is 	 	one	here	,	there	's	a	pop	song	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 de 	 scribe 	 s 	 	philippe	starck	for	me	,	you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	like	you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	like	puppy	love	,	you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	cool	right	?
 tooth 	 brush 	 	,	cool	.
it	 re 	 ally 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 get 	 s 	 	serious	when	you	look	at	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.	ok	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	 substitut 	 ion 	 	that	i	 believ 	 e 	 	all	of	us	,	in	design	management	,	are	 guilt 	 y 	 	of	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	idea	that	there	is	more	to	love	,	more	to	design	,	when	it	 get 	 s 	 	down	to	your	neighbor	,	your	other	,	it	can	be	physical	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	in	the	future	it	will	be	.
but	right	now	it	's	in	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	our	own	people	,	our	own	 team 	 s 	 	who	are	 do 	 ing 	 	the	creating	.	so	,	to	my	story	.
the	idea	of	people	-	work	is	what	we	work	with	here	,	and	i	have	to	make	a	bond	with	my	 design 	 ers 	 	when	we	're	creating	bmws	.
we	have	to	have	a	 share 	 d 	 	 in 	 timacy 	 	,	a	 share 	 d 	 	vision	--	that	 mean 	 s 	 	we	have	to	work	 a 	 s 	 	one	family	;	we	have	to	understand	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	that	way	.
there	's	good	 time 	 s 	 	;	there	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	 time 	 s 	 	;	and	there	's	some	stress	 time 	 s 	 	too	.
you	want	to	do	 car 	 s 	 	,	you	've	got	to	go	 out 	 side 	 	.
you	've	got	to	do	 car 	 s 	 	in	the	rain	;	you	've	got	to	do	 car 	 s 	 	in	the	snow	.
that	's	,	by	the	way	,	is	a	 present 	 ation 	 	we	made	to	our	board	of	 director 	 s 	 	.
we	haul	 the 	 ir 	 	 butt 	 s 	 	out	in	the	snow	,	too	.	you	want	to	know	 car 	 s 	 	 out 	 side 	 	?
well	,	you	've	got	to	stand	 out 	 side 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	these	are	 artist 	 s 	 	,	they	have	 ver 	 y 	 	 art 	 istic 	 	 temperament 	 s 	 	.
all	right	?	now	one	thing	about	art	is	,	art	is	 discover 	 y 	 	,	and	art	is	 discover 	 ing 	 	 your 	 self 	 	through	your	art	.	right	?
and	one	thing	about	 car 	 s 	 	is	we	're	all	a	little	bit	like	pygmalion	,	we	are	 complete 	 ly 	 	in	love	with	our	own	 creation 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 de 	 scribe 	 s 	 	our	relationship	with	 car 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	sick	beyond	belief	.
but	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	the	 in 	 timacy 	 	with	which	we	work	together	 a 	 s 	 	a	team	 take 	 s 	 	on	a	new	dimension	,	a	new	meaning	.
we	have	a	 share 	 d 	 	center	;	we	have	a	 share 	 d 	 	focus	--	that	car	 stay 	 s 	 	at	the	middle	of	all	our	 relationship 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	my	job	,	in	the	competitive	process	,	to	narrow	 th 	 is 	 	down	.
i	heard	 to 	 day 	 	about	joseph	's	death	 gene 	 s 	 	that	have	to	go	in	and	kill	cell	 re 	 production 	 	.
you	know	,	that	's	what	i	have	to	do	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	.
we	start	out	with	10	 car 	 s 	 	;	we	narrow	it	down	to	five	 car 	 s 	 	,	down	to	three	 car 	 s 	 	,	down	to	two	 car 	 s 	 	,	down	to	one	car	,	and	i	'm	in	the	middle	of	that	 kill 	 ing 	 	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	.
 some 	 one 	 	's	love	,	 some 	 one 	 	's	baby	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	,	and	you	have	to	have	a	bond	with	your	team	that	 permit 	 s 	 	you	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	life	is	 wrap 	 ped 	 	up	in	that	too	.
they	've	got	that	gene	 infect 	 ed 	 	in	them	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	and	they	want	that	to	live	,	more	than	 any 	 thing 	 	else	.
well	,	 th 	 is 	 	project	,	deep	blue	,	put	me	in	contact	with	my	team	in	a	way	that	i	never	 expect 	 ed 	 	,	and	i	want	to	pass	it	on	to	you	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	want	you	to	reflect	on	 th 	 is 	 	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	in	your	own	 relationship 	 s 	 	.
we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	a	do	a	car	which	was	a	complete	leap	of	faith	for	bmw	.
we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	a	team	which	was	so	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	from	the	way	we	'd	 d 	 one 	 	it	,	that	i	 on 	 ly 	 	had	a	phone	number	that	 connect 	 ed 	 	me	to	them	.
so	,	what	we	did	was	:	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	staff	of	 artist 	 s 	 	that	are	just	your	wrist	,	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	free	up	a	team	of	creative	 design 	 ers 	 	and	 engineer 	 s 	 	to	find	out	what	's	the	 success 	 or 	 	to	the	suv	 phenomen 	 on 	 	in	america	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	1996	we	did	 th 	 is 	 	project	.	and	so	we	 s 	 ent 	 	them	off	with	 th 	 is 	 	team	name	,	deep	blue	.	now	 man 	 y 	 	people	know	deep	blue	from	ibm	--	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	stole	it	from	them	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 figur 	 ed 	 	if	 any 	 body 	 	read	our	 fax 	 es 	 	they	'd	think	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 computer 	 s 	 	.
it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	it	was	 quit 	 e 	 	clever	 be 	 cause 	 	deep	blue	,	in	a	company	like	bmw	,	 ha 	 s 	 	a	hook	--	``	deep	blue	,	``	 w 	 ow 	 	,	cool	name	.
so	people	get	 wrap 	 ped 	 	up	in	it	.	and	we	took	a	team	of	 design 	 ers 	 	,	and	we	 s 	 ent 	 	them	off	to	america	.	and	we	 g 	 ave 	 	them	a	budget	,	what	we	thought	was	a	set	of	 deliver 	 able 	 s 	 	,	a	 time 	 table 	 	,	and	 noth 	 ing 	 	else	.
like	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	i	just	had	a	phone	number	that	 connect 	 ed 	 	me	to	them	.
and	a	group	of	 engineer 	 s 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	in	germany	,	and	the	idea	was	they	would	work	 separat 	 e 	 ly 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	problem	of	what	's	the	 success 	 or 	 	to	the	suv	.	they	would	come	together	,	 compar 	 e 	 	 note 	 s 	 	.	then	they	would	work	 a 	 part 	 	,	come	together	,	and	they	would	produce	together	a	 monument 	 al 	 	set	of	 divers 	 e 	 	 opinion 	 s 	 	that	did	n't	pollute	each	other	's	 idea 	 s 	 	--	but	at	the	same	time	came	together	and	resolved	the	 problem 	 s 	 	.
 hope 	 fully 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	understand	the	 custom 	 er 	 	at	 it 	 s 	 	heart	,	where	the	 custom 	 er 	 	is	,	live	with	them	in	america	.	so	--	 s 	 ent 	 	the	team	off	,	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	different	 happen 	 ed 	 	.	they	went	other	 place 	 s 	 	.
they	 disappear 	 ed 	 	,	 quit 	 e 	 	 honest 	 ly 	 	,	and	all	i	got	was	 post 	 card 	 s 	 	.
now	,	i	got	some	 post 	 card 	 s 	 	of	these	 guy 	 s 	 	in	las	vegas	,	and	i	got	some	 post 	 card 	 s 	 	of	these	 guy 	 s 	 	in	the	grand	canyon	,	and	i	got	these	 post 	 card 	 s 	 	of	niagara	 fall 	 s 	 	,	and	 pre 	 tty 	 	soon	they	're	in	new	york	,	and	i	do	n't	know	where	else	.
and	i	'm	 tell 	 ing 	 	 my 	 self 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	be	a	great	car	,	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	research	that	i	've	never	even	thought	about	before	.	``	right	?	and	they	 decide 	 d 	 	that	 in 	 stead 	 	of	,	like	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	studio	,	and	six	or	seven	 a 	 part 	 ments 	 	,	it	was	 cheap 	 er 	 	to	rent	elizabeth	taylor	's	ex	-	house	in	malibu	.
and	--	at	 l 	 east 	 	they	told	me	it	was	her	house	,	i	guess	it	was	at	one	time	,	she	had	a	party	there	or	 some 	 thing 	 	.
but	 any 	 way 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	house	,	and	they	all	lived	there	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	24/7	living	,	half	-	a	-	dozen	people	who	'd	left	 the 	 ir 	 	--	some	had	left	 the 	 ir 	 	wives	 be 	 hind 	 	and	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	,	and	they	 liter 	 ally 	 	lived	in	 th 	 is 	 	house	for	the	entire	six	 month 	 s 	 	the	project	was	in	america	,	but	the	first	three	 month 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	the	most	intensive	.
and	one	of	the	young	women	in	the	project	,	she	was	a	fantastic	 lad 	 y 	 	,	she	 actual 	 ly 	 	built	her	room	in	the	 bath 	 room 	 	.
the	 bath 	 room 	 	was	so	big	,	she	built	the	bed	over	the	 bath 	 tub 	 	--	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	 fasci 	 nating 	 	.
on	the	other	hand	,	i	did	n't	know	 any 	 thing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.	ok	?
 noth 	 ing 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	going	on	,	and	all	i	'm	 get 	 ting 	 	is	 post 	 card 	 s 	 	of	these	 guy 	 s 	 	in	las	vegas	,	or	 what 	 ever 	 	,	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	do	n't	worry	chris	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	going	to	be	good	.	``	ok	?
so	my	 con 	 cept 	 	of	what	a	design	studio	was	 prob 	 ably 	 	--	i	was	n't	up	to	speed	on	where	these	 guy 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	the	 engineer 	 s 	 	back	in	munich	had	taken	on	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	newtonian	solution	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	find	how	 man 	 y 	 	cup	 holder 	 s 	 	can	dance	on	the	head	of	a	pin	,	and	,	you	know	,	these	 re 	 ally 	 	serious	 question 	 s 	 	that	are	 confront 	 ing 	 	the	modern	consumer	.
and	one	was	 hop 	 ing 	 	that	these	two	 team 	 s 	 	would	get	together	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 coll 	 usion 	 	of	 in 	 credible 	 	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	,	under	these	 in 	 credible 	 	 surround 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	and	these	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 stress 	 ed 	 	-	out	 engineer 	 s 	 	,	would	create	some	 in 	 credible 	 	 solution 	 s 	 	.
well	,	what	i	did	n't	know	was	,	and	what	we	found	out	was	--	these	 guy 	 s 	 	,	they	ca	n't	even	like	talk	to	each	other	under	 t 	 hose 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	.
you	get	a	 diverge 	 nce 	 	of	newtonian	and	 quant 	 um 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	at	that	point	,	you	have	a	split	in	your	 dia 	 log 	 	that	is	so	deep	,	and	so	far	,	that	they	can	not	 br 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	together	at	all	.
and	so	we	had	our	first	 meet 	 ing 	 	,	after	three	 month 	 s 	 	,	in	tiburon	,	which	is	just	up	the	road	from	here	--	you	know	tiburon	?
and	the	idea	was	after	the	first	three	 month 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 dependent 	 	research	they	would	present	it	all	to	dr.	goschel	--	who	is	now	my	 bo 	 s 	 s 	 	,	and	at	that	time	he	was	co	-	mentor	on	the	project	--	and	they	would	present	 the 	 ir 	 	 result 	 s 	 	.
we	would	see	where	we	 we 	 re 	 	going	,	we	would	see	the	first	 indic 	 ation 	 	of	what	could	be	the	 success 	 ive 	 	 phenomen 	 on 	 	to	the	suv	in	america	.
and	so	i	had	these	 idea 	 s 	 	in	my	head	,	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	be	great	.
i	mean	,	i	'm	going	to	see	so	much	work	,	it	's	so	 intens 	 e 	 	--	i	know	 prob 	 ably 	 	las	vegas	 me 	 ant 	 	a	lot	about	it	,	and	i	'm	not	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	where	the	grand	canyon	came	in	either	--	but	 some 	 how 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	come	together	,	and	i	'm	going	to	see	some	 re 	 ally 	 	great	product	.
so	we	went	to	tiburon	,	after	three	 month 	 s 	 	,	and	the	team	had	gotten	together	the	week	before	,	 man 	 y 	 	 day 	 s 	 	 a 	 head 	 	of	time	.
the	 engineer 	 s 	 	flew	over	,	and	 design 	 ers 	 	got	together	with	them	,	and	they	put	 the 	 ir 	 	 present 	 ation 	 	together	.
well	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	the	 engineer 	 s 	 	had	n't	 d 	 one 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	.
and	they	had	n't	 d 	 one 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	--	kind	of	,	like	in	car	business	,	 engineer 	 s 	 	are	there	to	solve	 problem 	 s 	 	,	and	we	 we 	 re 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	them	to	create	a	problem	.
and	the	 engineer 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	the	 design 	 ers 	 	to	say	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	problem	that	we	've	 create 	 d 	 	,	now	help	us	solve	it	.	``
and	they	could	n't	talk	about	it	.	so	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	was	,	the	 engineer 	 s 	 	 show 	 ed 	 	up	with	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
and	the	 engineer 	 s 	 	told	the	 design 	 ers 	 	,	``	if	you	go	in	with	all	your	stuff	,	we	'll	walk	out	,	we	'll	walk	right	out	of	the	project	.	``	so	i	did	n't	know	any	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	we	got	a	 present 	 ation 	 	that	had	an	agenda	,	 look 	 ed 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
there	was	a	whole	lot	of	 dia 	 log 	 	.
we	 s 	 pent 	 	four	 hour 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	told	all	about	 vocabul 	 ary 	 	that	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	built	between	 engineer 	 s 	 	and	 design 	 ers 	 	.
and	here	i	'm	 expect 	 ing 	 	at	any	moment	,	``	ok	,	they	're	going	to	turn	the	page	,	and	i	'm	going	to	see	the	 car 	 s 	 	,	i	'm	going	to	see	the	 sketch 	 es 	 	,	i	'm	going	to	see	 may 	 be 	 	some	idea	of	where	it	's	going	.	``
 dia 	 log 	 	 ke 	 pt 	 	on	going	,	with	mental	 map 	 s 	 	of	 word 	 s 	 	,	and	 pre 	 tty 	 	soon	it	was	 be 	 coming 	 	obvious	that	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 dazzl 	 ed 	 	with	 brilli 	 ance 	 	,	i	was	 serious 	 ly 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 baffl 	 ed 	 	with	 bull 	 shit 	 	.
and	if	you	can	imagine	what	 th 	 is 	 	is	like	,	to	have	these	 month 	 s 	 	of	 post 	 card 	 	 indic 	 ation 	 	of	how	great	 th 	 is 	 	team	is	 work 	 ing 	 	,	and	they	're	out	there	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	money	,	and	they	're	 learn 	 ing 	 	,	and	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	.
i	went	 fuck 	 ing 	 	 ball 	 istic 	 	,	right	?	i	went	nuts	.
you	can	 prob 	 ably 	 	remember	tiburon	,	it	used	to	look	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
after	four	 hour 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	stood	up	,	and	i	took	 th 	 is 	 	team	 a 	 part 	 	.
i	 s 	 cream 	 ed 	 	at	them	,	i	 yell 	 ed 	 	at	them	,	``	what	the	hell	are	you	 do 	 ing 	 	?
you	're	 lett 	 ing 	 	me	down	,	you	're	my	 design 	 ers 	 	,	you	're	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	the	creative	 one 	 s 	 	,	what	the	hell	is	going	on	around	here	?	``	it	was	 prob 	 ably 	 	one	of	my	better	 tirade 	 s 	 	,	i	have	some	good	 one 	 s 	 	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	was	 prob 	 ably 	 	one	of	my	better	 one 	 s 	 	.	and	i	went	 in 	 to 	 	these	people	;	how	could	they	take	bmw	's	money	,	how	could	they	have	a	 holi 	 day 	 	for	three	 month 	 s 	 	and	produce	 noth 	 ing 	 	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	of	course	they	did	n't	tell	us	that	they	had	three	station	 wagon 	 s 	 	full	of	 draw 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	model	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	,	 picture 	 s 	 	--	 every 	 thing 	 	i	 want 	 ed 	 	,	they	'd	 lock 	 ed 	 	up	in	the	 car 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	had	 show 	 n 	 	 solid 	 arity 	 	with	the	 engineer 	 s 	 	--	and	they	'd	 decide 	 d 	 	not	to	show	me	 any 	 thing 	 	,	in	order	to	give	the	chance	for	problem	solving	a	chance	to	start	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	had	n't	 real 	 ized 	 	,	of	course	,	that	they	could	n't	do	problem	creating	.
so	we	went	to	lunch	--	and	i	've	got	to	tell	you	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	one	 serious 	 ly 	 	quiet	lunch	.
the	 engineer 	 s 	 	all	 s 	 at 	 	at	one	end	of	the	table	,	the	 design 	 ers 	 	and	i	 s 	 at 	 	at	the	other	end	of	the	table	,	 re 	 ally 	 	quiet	.
and	i	was	just	 fuck 	 ing 	 	 fur 	 ious 	 	,	 fur 	 ious 	 	.	ok	?
 prob 	 ably 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	had	all	the	 f 	 un 	 	and	i	did	n't	,	you	know	.
that	's	what	you	get	 fur 	 ious 	 	about	right	?
and	 some 	 body 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	about	catherine	,	my	wife	,	you	know	,	did	she	fly	out	with	me	or	 some 	 thing 	 	?
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	``	and	it	 trigger 	 ed 	 	a	set	of	 thought 	 s 	 	about	my	wife	.
and	i	 recall 	 ed 	 	that	when	catherine	and	i	 we 	 re 	 	married	,	the	priest	 g 	 ave 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	nice	sermon	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	love	is	not	 self 	 ish 	 	,	``	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	love	 do 	 es 	 	not	mean	 count 	 ing 	 	how	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	i	say	,	'	i	love	you	.	'
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	you	had	 s 	 ex 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	month	,	and	it	's	two	 time 	 s 	 	less	than	last	month	,	so	that	 mean 	 s 	 	you	do	n't	love	me	 a 	 s 	 	much	.
love	is	not	 self 	 ish 	 	.	``	and	i	thought	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	i	thought	,	``	you	know	,	i	'm	not	 show 	 ing 	 	love	here	.	i	'm	 serious 	 ly 	 	not	 show 	 ing 	 	love	.
i	'm	in	the	air	,	i	'm	in	the	air	 with 	 out 	 	trust	.
 th 	 is 	 	can	not	be	.	 th 	 is 	 	can	not	be	that	i	'm	 expect 	 ing 	 	a	certain	number	of	 sketch 	 es 	 	,	and	to	me	that	's	my	 quant 	 ification 	 	method	for	 qual 	 ifying 	 	a	team	.
 th 	 is 	 	can	not	be	.	``	so	i	told	them	 th 	 is 	 	story	.	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 guy 	 s 	 	,	i	'm	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 some 	 thing 	 	here	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	right	.	i	ca	n't	have	a	relationship	with	you	 guy 	 s 	 	based	on	a	 pre 	 mise 	 	that	is	a	 quant 	 ifiable 	 	one	.
based	on	a	 dict 	 ate 	 	 pre 	 mise 	 	that	 say 	 s 	 	,	'	i	'm	a	 bo 	 s 	 s 	 	,	you	do	what	i	say	,	 with 	 out 	 	trust	.	'	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	``	 th 	 is 	 	ca	n't	be	.	``
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	we	all	broke	down	 in 	 to 	 	 tear 	 s 	 	,	to	be	 quit 	 e 	 	honest	about	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	still	could	not	tell	me	how	much	 frust 	 ration 	 	they	had	built	up	 in 	 side 	 	of	them	,	not	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	show	me	what	i	 want 	 ed 	 	,	and	 mere 	 ly 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	ask	me	to	trust	them	that	it	would	come	.
and	i	think	we	felt	much	 close 	 r 	 	that	day	,	we	cut	a	lot	of	 string 	 s 	 	that	did	n't	need	to	be	there	,	and	we	 for 	 ged 	 	the	 con 	 cept 	 	for	what	real	team	and	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	is	all	about	.
we	put	the	car	back	at	the	center	of	our	 thought 	 s 	 	,	and	we	put	love	,	i	think	,	 tru 	 ly 	 	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	center	of	the	process	.
by	the	way	,	that	team	went	on	to	create	six	different	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	for	the	next	model	of	what	would	be	the	proposal	for	the	next	generation	after	suvs	in	america	.
one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	was	the	idea	of	a	 cross 	 over 	 	 coup 	 es 	 	--	you	see	it	 down 	 stair 	 s 	 	,	the	x	coupe	--	they	had	a	lot	of	 f 	 un 	 	with	that	.
it	was	the	 rend 	 ition 	 	of	our	 motor 	 cycle 	 	,	the	gs	,	 a 	 s 	 	carl	magnusson	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	brute	-	iful	,	``	 a 	 s 	 	the	idea	of	what	could	be	a	 motor 	 cycle 	 	,	if	you	add	two	more	 wheel 	 s 	 	.
and	so	,	in	 con 	 clusion 	 	,	my	 less 	 on 	 	that	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	pass	on	to	you	,	was	 th 	 is 	 	one	here	.	i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	going	to	steal	a	little	quote	out	of	``	little	prince	.	``
there	's	a	lot	to	be	 s 	 aid 	 	about	trust	and	love	,	if	you	know	that	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 word 	 s 	 	are	synonymous	for	design	.
i	had	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 meaning 	 ful 	 	relationship	with	my	team	that	day	,	and	it	's	 stay 	 ed 	 	that	way	ever	since	.
and	i	hope	that	you	too	find	that	there	's	more	to	design	,	and	more	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	art	of	the	design	,	than	 do 	 ing 	 	it	 your 	 self 	 	.
it	's	true	that	the	trust	and	the	love	,	that	 make 	 s 	 	it	 worth 	 while 	 	.
 thank 	 s 	 	so	much	.
