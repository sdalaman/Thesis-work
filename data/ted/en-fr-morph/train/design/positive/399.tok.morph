i	thought	i	'd	start	with	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	or	 show 	 ing 	 	you	the	people	who	 start 	 ed 	 	[	jet	 pro 	 pulsion 	 	lab	]	.
when	they	 we 	 re 	 	a	bunch	of	 kid 	 s 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	kind	of	 ver 	 y 	 	 imagin 	 ative 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 ad 	 vent 	 ur 	 ous 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	at	caltech	to	mix	 chemical 	 s 	 	and	see	which	one	 blow 	 s 	 	up	more	.
well	,	i	do	n't	recommend	that	you	try	to	do	that	now	.
 natural 	 ly 	 	,	they	 ble 	 w 	 	up	a	 s 	 hack 	 	,	and	caltech	,	well	,	then	,	 he 	 y 	 	,	you	go	to	the	arroyo	and	 re 	 ally 	 	do	all	your	 test 	 s 	 	in	there	.
so	,	that	's	what	we	call	our	first	five	 employ 	 ees 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	tea	break	,	you	know	,	in	here	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 ad 	 vent 	 ur 	 ous 	 	people	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	matter	of	fact	,	one	of	them	,	who	was	,	kind	of	,	part	of	a	cult	which	was	not	too	far	from	here	on	 o 	 range 	 	grove	,	and	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	he	 ble 	 w 	 	up	 him 	 self 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 ke 	 pt 	 	 mix 	 ing 	 	 chemical 	 s 	 	and	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	which	 one 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	the	best	 chemical 	 s 	 	.
so	,	that	 give 	 s 	 	you	a	kind	of	flavor	of	the	kind	of	people	we	have	there	.
we	try	to	avoid	 blow 	 ing 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	up	.
 th 	 is 	 	one	i	thought	i	'd	show	you	.
guess	which	one	is	a	jpl	 employ 	 ee 	 	in	the	heart	of	 th 	 is 	 	crowd	.
i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	come	like	him	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	i	 walk 	 ed 	 	out	,	then	it	was	too	cold	,	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	i	'd	better	put	my	shirt	back	on	.
but	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	the	reason	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	show	 th 	 is 	 	picture	:	look	where	the	other	people	are	looking	,	and	look	where	he	is	looking	.
 where 	 ver 	 	 any 	 body 	 	else	 look 	 s 	 	,	look	 some 	 where 	 	else	,	and	go	do	 some 	 thing 	 	different	,	you	know	,	and	 do 	 ing 	 	that	.
and	that	's	kind	of	what	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	the	spirit	of	what	we	are	 do 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	want	to	tell	you	a	quote	from	ralph	emerson	that	one	of	my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	put	on	my	wall	in	my	 off 	 ice 	 	,	and	it	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	do	not	go	where	the	path	may	lead	.
go	 in 	 stead 	 	where	there	is	no	path	,	and	 leav 	 e 	 	a	trail	.	``
and	that	's	my	 recommend 	 ation 	 	to	all	of	you	:	look	what	 every 	 body 	 	is	 do 	 ing 	 	,	what	they	are	 do 	 ing 	 	;	go	do	 some 	 thing 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	.
do	n't	try	to	improve	a	little	bit	on	what	 some 	 body 	 	else	is	 do 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	get	you	 ver 	 y 	 	far	.
in	our	early	 day 	 s 	 	we	used	to	work	a	lot	on	 rocket 	 s 	 	,	but	we	 al 	 so 	 	used	to	have	a	lot	of	 part 	 ies 	 	,	you	know	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	one	of	our	 part 	 ies 	 	,	you	know	,	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
but	then	a	big	 differ 	 ence 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	about	50	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	after	sputnik	was	 launch 	 ed 	 	.	we	 launch 	 ed 	 	the	first	american	satellite	,	and	that	's	the	one	you	see	on	the	left	in	there	.
and	here	we	made	180	 degree 	 s 	 	change	:	we	 change 	 d 	 	from	a	rocket	house	to	be	an	exploration	house	.
and	that	was	 d 	 one 	 	over	a	period	of	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	now	we	are	the	 lead 	 ing 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	,	you	know	,	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	space	on	all	of	your	 be 	 half 	 	.
but	even	when	we	did	that	,	we	had	to	 re 	 mind 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	there	are	 set 	 back 	 s 	 	.
so	you	see	,	on	the	bottom	,	that	rocket	was	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	go	 up 	 ward 	 	;	 some 	 how 	 	it	 end 	 ed 	 	going	 side 	 ways 	 	.
so	that	's	what	we	call	the	 mis 	 guide 	 d 	 	 mis 	 s 	 ile 	 	.
but	then	 al 	 so 	 	,	just	to	 celebr 	 ate 	 	that	,	we	 start 	 ed 	 	an	event	at	jpl	for	``	 mis 	 s 	 	 guide 	 d 	 	 mis 	 s 	 ile 	 	.	``
so	,	we	used	to	have	a	 celebr 	 ation 	 	every	year	and	select	--
there	used	to	be	 com 	 petition 	 	and	 para 	 de 	 s 	 	and	so	on	.
it	's	not	 ver 	 y 	 	appropriate	to	do	it	now	.	some	people	tell	me	to	do	it	;	i	think	,	well	,	that	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	proper	,	you	know	,	these	 day 	 s 	 	.
so	,	we	do	 some 	 thing 	 	a	little	bit	more	serious	.
and	that	's	what	you	see	in	the	last	rose	bowl	,	you	know	,	when	we	 enter 	 ed 	 	one	of	the	 float 	 s 	 	.
that	's	more	on	the	play	side	.	and	on	the	right	side	,	that	's	the	 r 	 over 	 	just	before	we	 finish 	 ed 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 test 	 ing 	 	to	take	it	to	the	cape	to	launch	it	.
these	are	the	 r 	 over 	 s 	 	up	here	that	you	have	on	mars	now	.
so	that	kind	of	 tell 	 s 	 	you	about	,	kind	of	,	the	 f 	 un 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	and	the	serious	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	try	to	do	.
but	i	 s 	 aid 	 	i	'm	going	to	show	you	a	short	clip	of	one	of	our	 employ 	 ees 	 	to	kind	of	give	you	an	idea	about	some	of	the	talent	that	we	have	.

charles	elachi	:	now	,	moving	from	the	play	stuff	to	the	serious	stuff	,	 al 	 ways 	 	people	ask	,	why	do	we	explore	?
why	are	we	 do 	 ing 	 	all	of	these	 mission 	 s 	 	and	why	are	we	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	them	?
well	,	the	way	i	think	about	it	is	 fair 	 ly 	 	simple	.
 some 	 how 	 	,	13	billion	 year 	 s 	 	ago	there	was	a	big	bang	,	and	you	've	heard	a	little	bit	about	,	you	know	,	the	origin	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
but	 some 	 how 	 	what	 strike 	 s 	 	 every 	 body 	 	's	 imagin 	 ation 	 	--	or	 lot 	 s 	 	of	people	's	 imagin 	 ation 	 	--	 some 	 how 	 	from	that	original	big	bang	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	world	that	we	live	in	 to 	 day 	 	.
you	look	 out 	 side 	 	:	you	have	all	that	 beaut 	 y 	 	that	you	see	,	all	that	life	that	you	see	around	you	,	and	here	we	have	intelligent	people	like	you	and	i	who	are	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	conversation	here	.
all	that	 start 	 ed 	 	from	that	big	bang	.	so	,	the	question	is	:	how	did	that	happen	?	how	did	that	evolve	?	how	did	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	form	?
how	did	the	 galax 	 ies 	 	form	?	how	did	the	 planet 	 s 	 	form	?
why	is	there	a	planet	on	which	there	is	life	which	have	 evolv 	 ed 	 	?
is	that	 ver 	 y 	 	common	?
is	there	life	on	every	planet	that	you	can	see	around	the	 star 	 s 	 	?
so	we	 liter 	 ally 	 	are	all	made	out	of	 star 	 dust 	 	.
we	 start 	 ed 	 	from	 t 	 hose 	 	 star 	 s 	 	;	we	are	made	of	 star 	 dust 	 	.
so	,	next	time	you	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 depress 	 ed 	 	,	look	in	the	mirror	and	you	can	look	and	say	,	hi	,	i	'm	looking	at	a	star	here	.
you	can	skip	the	dust	part	.
but	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	we	are	all	made	of	 star 	 dust 	 	.
so	,	what	we	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	in	our	exploration	is	 effective 	 ly 	 	write	the	book	of	how	 thing 	 s 	 	have	came	about	 a 	 s 	 	they	are	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	one	of	the	first	,	or	the	 eas 	 iest 	 	,	 place 	 s 	 	we	can	go	and	explore	that	is	to	go	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	mars	.
and	the	reason	mars	 take 	 s 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	attention	:
it	's	not	 ver 	 y 	 	far	from	us	.
you	know	,	it	'll	take	us	 on 	 ly 	 	six	 month 	 s 	 	to	get	there	.
six	to	nine	 month 	 s 	 	at	the	right	time	of	the	year	.
it	's	a	planet	 some 	 what 	 	similar	to	earth	.	it	's	a	little	bit	 small 	 er 	 	,	but	the	land	mass	on	mars	is	about	the	same	 a 	 s 	 	the	land	mass	on	earth	,	you	know	,	if	you	do	n't	take	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	account	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	polar	 cap 	 s 	 	.	it	 ha 	 s 	 	an	atmosphere	 some 	 what 	 	 th 	 inner 	 	than	 our 	 s 	 	,	so	it	 ha 	 s 	 	weather	.	so	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	to	some	 ex 	 tent 	 	,	and	you	can	see	some	of	the	 feature 	 s 	 	on	it	,	like	the	grand	canyon	on	mars	,	or	what	we	call	the	grand	canyon	on	mars	.
it	is	like	the	grand	canyon	on	earth	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	a	hell	of	a	lot	 large 	 r 	 	.
so	it	's	about	the	 s 	 ize 	 	,	you	know	,	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	 volcan 	 o 	 es 	 	on	it	.	and	that	's	mount	olympus	on	mars	,	which	is	a	kind	of	huge	 volcan 	 ic 	 	shield	on	that	planet	.
and	if	you	look	at	the	height	of	it	and	you	 compar 	 e 	 	it	to	mount	everest	,	you	see	,	it	'll	give	you	an	idea	of	how	large	that	mount	olympus	,	you	know	,	is	,	 relat 	 ive 	 	to	mount	everest	.
so	,	it	 bas 	 ically 	 	 dwarf 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	mount	everest	here	on	earth	.
so	,	that	 give 	 s 	 	you	an	idea	of	the	tectonic	 event 	 s 	 	or	 volcan 	 ic 	 	 event 	 s 	 	which	have	 happen 	 ed 	 	on	that	planet	.
 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	from	one	of	our	 satellite 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 show 	 s 	 	that	it	's	earth	-	like	--	we	caught	a	 land 	 slide 	 	 occur 	 ring 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
so	it	is	a	dynamic	planet	,	and	activity	is	going	on	 a 	 s 	 	we	speak	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	these	 r 	 over 	 s 	 	,	people	wonder	now	,	what	are	they	 do 	 ing 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	so	i	thought	i	would	show	you	a	little	bit	what	they	are	 do 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	 ver 	 y 	 	large	 crat 	 er 	 	.	 geo 	 logists 	 	love	 crat 	 ers 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 crat 	 ers 	 	are	like	 dig 	 ging 	 	a	big	hole	in	the	ground	 with 	 out 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	at	it	,	and	you	can	see	what	's	 be 	 low 	 	the	surface	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	victoria	 crat 	 er 	 	,	which	is	about	a	few	 foot 	 ball 	 	 field 	 s 	 	in	 s 	 ize 	 	.
and	if	you	look	at	the	top	left	,	you	see	a	little	 teen 	 y 	 	dark	dot	.
 th 	 is 	 	picture	was	taken	from	an	 orbit 	 ing 	 	satellite	.
if	i	zoom	on	it	,	you	can	see	:	that	's	the	 r 	 over 	 	on	the	surface	.
so	,	that	was	taken	from	orbit	;	we	had	the	camera	zoom	on	the	surface	,	and	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	saw	the	 r 	 over 	 	on	the	surface	.
and	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	used	the	combination	of	the	satellite	 image 	 s 	 	and	the	 r 	 over 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	conduct	science	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	can	 observ 	 e 	 	large	 area 	 s 	 	and	then	you	can	get	 t 	 hose 	 	 r 	 over 	 s 	 	to	move	around	and	 bas 	 ically 	 	go	to	a	certain	location	.
so	,	 specific 	 ally 	 	what	we	are	 do 	 ing 	 	now	is	that	 r 	 over 	 	is	going	down	in	that	 crat 	 er 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	told	you	,	 geo 	 logists 	 	love	 crat 	 ers 	 	.
and	the	reason	is	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	went	to	the	grand	canyon	,	and	you	see	in	the	wall	of	the	grand	canyon	,	you	see	these	 layer 	 s 	 	.
and	what	these	 layer 	 s 	 	--	that	's	what	the	surface	used	to	be	a	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	10	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	100	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	you	get	 deposit 	 s 	 	on	top	of	them	.
so	if	you	can	read	the	 layer 	 s 	 	it	's	like	 read 	 ing 	 	your	book	,	and	you	can	learn	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	past	in	that	location	.
so	what	you	are	 see 	 ing 	 	here	are	the	 layer 	 s 	 	on	the	wall	of	that	 crat 	 er 	 	,	and	the	 r 	 over 	 	is	going	down	now	,	 measur 	 ing 	 	,	you	know	,	the	 proper 	 ties 	 	and	 analyz 	 ing 	 	the	 rock 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	's	going	down	,	you	know	,	that	canyon	.
now	,	it	's	kind	of	a	little	bit	of	a	 challeng 	 e 	 	 driv 	 ing 	 	down	a	 slop 	 e 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
if	you	 we 	 re 	 	there	you	would	n't	do	it	 your 	 self 	 	.
but	we	 re 	 ally 	 	made	 s 	 ure 	 	we	tested	 t 	 hose 	 	 r 	 over 	 s 	 	before	we	got	them	down	--	or	that	 r 	 over 	 	--	and	made	 s 	 ure 	 	that	it	's	all	 work 	 ing 	 	well	.
now	,	when	i	came	last	time	,	 short 	 ly 	 	after	the	 land 	 ing 	 	--	i	think	it	was	,	like	,	a	hundred	 day 	 s 	 	after	the	 land 	 ing 	 	--	i	told	you	i	was	 surprise 	 d 	 	that	 t 	 hose 	 	 r 	 over 	 s 	 	are	 last 	 ing 	 	even	a	hundred	 day 	 s 	 	.
well	,	here	we	are	four	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	and	they	're	still	 work 	 ing 	 	.
now	you	say	,	charles	,	you	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 ly 	 ing 	 	to	us	,	and	so	on	,	but	that	's	not	true	.	we	 re 	 ally 	 	 believ 	 ed 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	last	90	 day 	 s 	 	or	100	 day 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	solar	powered	,	and	mars	is	a	 dust 	 y 	 	planet	,	so	we	 expect 	 ed 	 	the	dust	would	start	 accumul 	 ating 	 	on	the	surface	,	and	after	a	while	we	would	n't	have	 en 	 ough 	 	power	,	you	know	,	to	keep	them	warm	.
well	,	i	 al 	 ways 	 	say	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	that	you	are	smart	,	but	every	once	in	a	while	it	's	good	to	be	 luck 	 y 	 	.
and	that	's	what	we	found	out	.	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	that	every	once	in	a	while	there	are	dust	 devil 	 s 	 	which	come	by	on	mars	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	are	 see 	 ing 	 	here	,	and	when	the	dust	devil	 come 	 s 	 	over	the	 r 	 over 	 	,	it	just	 clean 	 s 	 	it	up	.
it	is	like	a	brand	new	car	that	you	have	,	and	that	's	 liter 	 ally 	 	why	they	have	 last 	 ed 	 	so	long	.
and	now	we	designed	them	 reason 	 ably 	 	well	,	but	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	why	they	are	 last 	 ing 	 	that	long	and	still	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	all	the	science	data	.
now	,	the	two	 r 	 over 	 s 	 	,	each	one	of	them	is	,	kind	of	,	 get 	 ting 	 	old	.
you	know	,	one	of	them	,	one	of	the	 wheel 	 s 	 	is	 s 	 tuck 	 	,	is	not	 work 	 ing 	 	,
one	of	the	front	 wheel 	 s 	 	,	so	what	we	are	 do 	 ing 	 	,	we	are	 driv 	 ing 	 	it	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	.
and	the	other	one	 ha 	 s 	 	 art 	 hritis 	 	of	the	shoulder	joint	,	you	know	,	it	's	not	 work 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	well	,	so	it	's	 walk 	 ing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	we	can	move	the	arm	,	you	know	,	that	way	.
but	still	they	are	producing	a	lot	of	scientific	data	.
now	,	 dur 	 ing 	 	that	whole	period	,	a	number	of	people	got	 excit 	 ed 	 	,	you	know	,	 out 	 side 	 	the	science	community	about	these	 r 	 over 	 s 	 	,	so	i	thought	i	'd	show	you	a	video	just	to	give	you	a	 reflect 	 ion 	 	about	how	these	 r 	 over 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 view 	 ed 	 	by	people	other	than	the	science	community	.
so	let	me	go	on	the	next	short	video	.
by	the	way	,	 th 	 is 	 	video	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	accurate	of	how	the	 land 	 ing 	 	took	place	,	you	know	,	about	four	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.

so	 any 	 way 	 	,	let	me	 continu 	 e 	 	on	 show 	 ing 	 	you	a	little	bit	about	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	of	that	planet	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	,	it	 look 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	like	earth	,	so	you	see	sand	 dune 	 s 	 	.
it	 look 	 s 	 	like	i	could	have	told	you	these	are	 picture 	 s 	 	taken	from	the	sahara	desert	or	 some 	 where 	 	,	and	you	'd	have	 believ 	 ed 	 	me	,	but	these	are	 picture 	 s 	 	taken	from	mars	.
but	one	area	which	is	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 intrigu 	 ing 	 	for	us	is	the	 north 	 ern 	 	region	,	you	know	,	of	mars	,	close	to	the	north	pole	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	see	ice	 cap 	 s 	 	,	and	we	see	the	ice	 cap 	 s 	 	 shrink 	 ing 	 	and	 expand 	 ing 	 	,	so	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	much	like	you	have	in	 north 	 ern 	 	canada	.
and	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	find	out	--	and	we	see	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 glaci 	 al 	 	 feature 	 s 	 	on	it	.
so	,	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	find	out	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	what	is	that	ice	made	of	,	and	could	that	have	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	in	it	some	 organ 	 ic 	 	,	you	know	,	material	.
so	we	have	a	 space 	 craft 	 	which	is	 head 	 ing 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	mars	,	 call 	 ed 	 	phoenix	,	and	that	 space 	 craft 	 	will	land	17	 day 	 s 	 	,	seven	 hour 	 s 	 	and	20	 second 	 s 	 	from	now	,	so	you	can	adjust	your	watch	.
so	it	's	on	may	25	around	just	before	five	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	our	time	here	on	the	west	coast	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	we	will	be	 land 	 ing 	 	on	 an 	 other 	 	planet	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	of	the	 space 	 craft 	 	put	on	mars	,	but	i	thought	that	just	in	case	you	're	going	to	 mis 	 s 	 	that	show	,	you	know	,	in	17	 day 	 s 	 	,	i	'll	show	you	,	kind	of	,	a	little	bit	of	what	's	going	to	happen	.
video	:	that	's	what	we	call	the	seven	 minute 	 s 	 	of	terror	.
so	the	plan	is	to	dig	in	the	 s 	 oil 	 	and	take	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	that	we	put	them	in	an	oven	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	heat	them	and	look	what	 gas 	 es 	 	will	come	from	it	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	was	 launch 	 ed 	 	about	nine	 month 	 s 	 	ago	.
we	'll	be	coming	in	at	12,000	 mile 	 s 	 	per	hour	,	and	in	seven	 minute 	 s 	 	we	have	to	stop	and	touch	the	surface	 ver 	 y 	 	 soft 	 ly 	 	so	we	do	n't	break	that	 land 	 er 	 	.
ben	cichy	:	phoenix	is	the	first	mars	scout	mission	.
it	's	the	first	mission	that	's	going	to	try	to	land	near	the	north	pole	of	mars	,	and	it	's	the	first	mission	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	to	try	and	reach	out	and	touch	water	on	the	surface	of	 an 	 other 	 	planet	.
lynn	craig	:	where	there	 tend 	 s 	 	to	be	water	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	on	earth	,	there	 tend 	 s 	 	to	be	life	,	and	so	it	's	 potential 	 ly 	 	a	place	where	life	could	have	 exist 	 ed 	 	on	the	planet	in	the	past	.
erik	bailey	:	the	main	purpose	of	edl	is	to	take	a	 space 	 craft 	 	that	is	 travel 	 ing 	 	at	12,500	 mile 	 s 	 	an	hour	and	 br 	 ing 	 	it	to	a	 screech 	 ing 	 	halt	in	a	soft	way	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	short	amount	of	time	.
bc	:	we	enter	the	martian	atmosphere	.
we	're	70	 mile 	 s 	 	above	the	surface	of	mars	.
and	our	 land 	 er 	 	is	 safe 	 ly 	 	 tuck 	 ed 	 	 in 	 side 	 	what	we	call	an	aero	-	shuttle	.
eb	:	 look 	 s 	 	kind	of	like	an	ice	cream	 con 	 e 	 	,	more	or	less	.
bc	:	and	on	the	front	of	it	is	 th 	 is 	 	heat	shield	,	 th 	 is 	 	saucer	-	looking	thing	that	 ha 	 s 	 	about	a	half	-	inch	of	 essential 	 ly 	 	what	's	cork	on	the	front	of	it	,	which	is	our	heat	shield	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	special	cork	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	cork	is	what	's	going	to	protect	us	from	the	violent	 at 	 mo 	 spheric 	 	entry	that	we	're	about	to	experience	.
rob	grover	:	friction	 re 	 ally 	 	 start 	 s 	 	to	build	up	on	the	 space 	 craft 	 	,	and	we	use	the	friction	when	it	's	 fly 	 ing 	 	through	the	atmosphere	to	our	advantage	to	 s 	 low 	 	us	down	.
bc	:	from	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	we	're	going	to	 decele 	 rate 	 	from	12,500	 mile 	 s 	 	an	hour	down	to	900	 mile 	 s 	 	an	hour	.
eb	:	the	 out 	 side 	 	can	get	 al 	 most 	 	 a 	 s 	 	hot	 a 	 s 	 	the	surface	of	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
rg	:	the	temperature	of	the	heat	shield	can	reach	2,600	 degree 	 s 	 	fahrenheit	.
eb	:	the	 in 	 side 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	get	 ver 	 y 	 	hot	.
it	 prob 	 ably 	 	 get 	 s 	 	about	room	temperature	.
richard	kornfeld	:	there	is	 th 	 is 	 	window	of	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	 with 	 in 	 	which	we	can	deploy	the	 parachut 	 e 	 	.
eb	:	if	you	fire	the	'	chute	too	early	,	the	 parachut 	 e 	 	 it 	 self 	 	could	fail	.
the	fabric	and	the	 stitch 	 ing 	 	could	just	pull	 a 	 part 	 	.
and	that	would	be	bad	.
bc	:	in	the	first	15	 second 	 s 	 	after	we	deploy	the	 parachut 	 e 	 	,	we	'll	 decele 	 rate 	 	from	900	 mile 	 s 	 	an	hour	to	a	 relat 	 ively 	 	 s 	 low 	 	250	 mile 	 s 	 	an	hour	.
we	no	 long 	 er 	 	need	the	heat	shield	to	protect	us	from	the	force	of	 at 	 mo 	 spheric 	 	entry	,	so	we	jettison	the	heat	shield	,	 ex 	 posing 	 	for	the	first	time	our	 land 	 er 	 	to	the	atmosphere	of	mars	.
lc	:	after	the	heat	shield	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 jettison 	 ed 	 	and	the	 leg 	 s 	 	are	 deploy 	 ed 	 	,	the	next	step	is	to	have	the	radar	system	begin	to	detect	how	far	phoenix	 re 	 ally 	 	is	from	the	ground	.
bc	:	we	've	lost	99	percent	of	our	entry	 velo 	 city 	 	.
so	,	we	're	99	percent	of	the	way	to	where	we	want	to	be	.
but	that	last	one	percent	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 al 	 ways 	 	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	,	is	the	 trick 	 y 	 	part	.
eb	:	now	the	 space 	 craft 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	decide	when	it	's	going	to	get	rid	of	 it 	 s 	 	 parachut 	 e 	 	.
bc	:	we	 separat 	 e 	 	from	the	 land 	 er 	 	going	125	 mile 	 s 	 	an	hour	at	 rough 	 ly 	 	a	kilometer	above	the	surface	of	mars	:	3,200	feet	.
that	's	like	taking	two	empire	state	 building 	 s 	 	and	 stack 	 ing 	 	them	on	top	of	one	 an 	 other 	 	.
eb	:	that	's	when	we	 separat 	 e 	 	from	the	back	shell	,	and	we	're	now	in	free	-	fall	.
it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 scar 	 y 	 	moment	;	a	lot	 ha 	 s 	 	to	happen	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	short	amount	of	time	.
lc	:	so	it	's	in	a	free	-	fall	,	but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	use	all	of	 it 	 s 	 	 actu 	 ators 	 	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	it	's	in	the	right	position	to	land	.
eb	:	and	then	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	light	up	 it 	 s 	 	 engine 	 s 	 	,	right	 it 	 self 	 	,	and	then	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	 s 	 low 	 	 it 	 self 	 	down	and	touch	down	on	the	ground	 safe 	 ly 	 	.
bc	:	earth	and	mars	are	so	far	 a 	 part 	 	that	it	 take 	 s 	 	over	ten	 minute 	 s 	 	for	a	signal	from	mars	to	get	to	earth	.
and	edl	 it 	 self 	 	is	all	over	in	a	matter	of	seven	 minute 	 s 	 	.
so	by	the	time	you	even	hear	from	the	 land 	 er 	 	that	edl	 ha 	 s 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	it	'll	 al 	 ready 	 	be	over	.
eb	:	we	have	to	build	large	 amount 	 s 	 	of	 auto 	 nomy 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 space 	 craft 	 	so	that	it	can	land	 it 	 self 	 	 safe 	 ly 	 	.
bc	:	edl	is	 th 	 is 	 	immense	,	 technical 	 ly 	 	 challeng 	 ing 	 	problem	.
it	's	about	 get 	 ting 	 	a	 space 	 craft 	 	that	's	 hurt 	 ling 	 	through	deep	space	and	using	all	 th 	 is 	 	bag	of	 trick 	 s 	 	to	 some 	 how 	 	figure	out	how	to	get	it	down	to	the	surface	of	mars	at	zero	 mile 	 s 	 	an	hour	.
it	's	 th 	 is 	 	 immense 	 ly 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	and	 challeng 	 ing 	 	problem	.
ce	:	 hope 	 fully 	 	it	all	will	happen	the	way	you	saw	it	in	here	.
so	it	will	be	a	 ver 	 y 	 	tense	moment	,	you	know	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	are	 watch 	 ing 	 	that	 space 	 craft 	 	 land 	 ing 	 	on	 an 	 other 	 	planet	.
so	now	let	me	talk	about	the	next	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	are	 do 	 ing 	 	.
so	we	are	in	the	process	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	speak	,	of	 actual 	 ly 	 	 design 	 ing 	 	the	next	 r 	 over 	 	that	we	are	going	to	be	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	to	mars	.
so	i	thought	i	would	go	a	little	bit	and	tell	you	,	kind	of	,	the	 step 	 s 	 	we	go	through	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	to	what	you	do	when	you	design	your	product	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	saw	a	little	bit	 ear 	 lier 	 	,	when	we	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	the	phoenix	one	,	we	have	to	take	 in 	 to 	 	account	the	heat	that	we	are	going	to	be	facing	.
so	we	have	to	 stud 	 y 	 	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	different	 material 	 s 	 	,	the	shape	that	we	want	to	do	.
in	general	we	do	n't	try	to	 pleas 	 e 	 	the	 custom 	 er 	 	here	.
what	we	want	to	do	is	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	we	have	an	effective	,	you	know	,	an	efficient	kind	of	machine	.
first	we	start	by	we	want	to	have	our	 employ 	 ees 	 	to	be	 a 	 s 	 	 imagin 	 ative 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	can	.
and	we	 re 	 ally 	 	love	 be 	 ing 	 	close	to	the	art	center	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	matter	of	fact	,	one	of	the	 al 	 um 	 ni 	 	from	the	art	center	,	eric	nyquist	,	had	put	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 dis 	 play 	 s 	 	,	far	-	out	 dis 	 play 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	in	our	what	we	call	mission	design	or	 space 	 craft 	 	design	room	,	just	to	get	people	to	think	 wild 	 ly 	 	about	 thing 	 s 	 	.
we	have	a	bunch	of	legos	.	so	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 play 	 ground 	 	for	 adult 	 s 	 	,	where	they	 s 	 it 	 	down	and	try	to	play	with	different	 shape 	 s 	 	and	different	 design 	 s 	 	.
then	we	get	a	little	bit	more	serious	,	so	we	have	what	we	call	our	cad	/	 cam 	 s 	 	and	all	the	 engineer 	 s 	 	who	are	 involve 	 d 	 	,	or	 scientist 	 s 	 	who	are	 involve 	 d 	 	,	who	know	about	thermal	 proper 	 ties 	 	,	know	about	design	,	know	about	 at 	 mo 	 spheric 	 	 interact 	 ion 	 	,	 parachut 	 es 	 	,	all	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	which	they	work	in	a	team	effort	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	design	a	 space 	 craft 	 	in	a	computer	to	some	 ex 	 tent 	 	,	so	to	see	,	 do 	 es 	 	that	meet	the	 requir 	 ement 	 	that	we	need	.
on	the	right	,	 al 	 so 	 	,	we	have	to	take	 in 	 to 	 	account	the	environment	of	the	planet	where	we	are	going	.
if	you	are	going	to	jupiter	,	you	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	high	-	 radi 	 ation 	 	,	you	know	,	environment	.	it	's	about	the	same	 radi 	 ation 	 	environment	close	by	jupiter	 a 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	a	nuclear	reactor	.
so	just	imagine	:	you	take	your	p.c	.	and	throw	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	nuclear	reactor	and	it	still	 ha 	 s 	 	to	work	.
so	these	are	kind	of	some	of	the	little	 challeng 	 es 	 	,	you	know	,	that	we	have	to	face	.
if	we	are	 do 	 ing 	 	entry	,	we	have	to	do	 test 	 s 	 	of	 parachut 	 es 	 	.
you	saw	in	the	video	a	 parachut 	 e 	 	 break 	 ing 	 	.	that	would	be	a	bad	day	,	you	know	,	if	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	so	we	have	to	test	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	are	 deploy 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 parachut 	 e 	 	at	 super 	 sonic 	 	 speed 	 s 	 	.
we	are	coming	at	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	high	 speed 	 s 	 	,	and	we	are	 deploy 	 ing 	 	them	to	 s 	 low 	 	us	down	.	so	we	have	to	do	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 test 	 s 	 	.
to	give	you	an	idea	of	the	 s 	 ize 	 	,	you	know	,	of	that	 parachut 	 e 	 	 relat 	 ive 	 	to	the	people	 stand 	 ing 	 	there	.
next	step	,	we	go	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	build	some	kind	of	test	 model 	 s 	 	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	test	them	,	you	know	,	in	the	lab	at	jpl	,	in	what	we	call	our	mars	yard	.
we	kick	them	,	we	hit	them	,	we	drop	them	,	just	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	we	understand	how	,	where	would	they	break	.
and	then	we	back	off	,	you	know	,	from	that	point	.
and	then	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	the	actual	building	and	the	flight	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	next	 r 	 over 	 	that	we	're	 fly 	 ing 	 	is	about	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	car	.
that	big	shield	that	you	see	 out 	 side 	 	,	that	's	a	heat	shield	which	is	going	to	protect	it	.
and	that	will	be	 bas 	 ically 	 	built	over	the	next	year	,	and	it	will	be	 launch 	 ed 	 	june	a	year	from	now	.
now	,	in	that	case	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	big	 r 	 over 	 	,	we	could	n't	use	 airbag 	 s 	 	.
and	i	know	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	,	kind	of	,	last	time	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	well	,	that	was	a	cool	thing	to	have	--	 t 	 hose 	 	 airbag 	 s 	 	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 r 	 over 	 	is	,	like	,	ten	 time 	 s 	 	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	,	you	know	,	mass	-	wise	,	of	the	other	 r 	 over 	 	,	or	three	 time 	 s 	 	the	mass	.
so	we	ca	n't	use	 airbag 	 s 	 	.	so	we	have	to	come	up	with	 an 	 other 	 	 ing 	 en 	 ious 	 	idea	of	how	do	we	land	it	.
and	we	did	n't	want	to	take	it	 pro 	 puls 	 ively 	 	all	the	way	to	the	surface	 be 	 cause 	 	we	did	n't	want	to	 contami 	 n 	 ate 	 	the	surface	;	we	 want 	 ed 	 	the	 r 	 over 	 	to	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	land	on	 it 	 s 	 	 leg 	 s 	 	.
so	we	came	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	 ing 	 en 	 ious 	 	idea	,	which	is	used	here	on	earth	for	 helicopter 	 s 	 	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	the	 land 	 er 	 	will	come	down	to	about	100	feet	and	hover	above	that	surface	for	100	feet	,	and	then	we	have	a	sky	 cr 	 ane 	 	which	will	take	that	 r 	 over 	 	and	land	it	down	on	the	surface	.
 hope 	 fully 	 	it	all	will	work	,	you	know	,	it	will	work	that	way	.
and	that	 r 	 over 	 	will	be	more	kind	of	like	a	chemist	.
what	we	are	going	to	be	 do 	 ing 	 	with	that	 r 	 over 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	 drive 	 s 	 	around	,	it	's	going	to	go	and	 analyz 	 e 	 	the	chemical	 com 	 position 	 	of	 rock 	 s 	 	.	so	it	will	have	an	arm	which	will	take	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	,	put	them	in	an	oven	,	crush	and	 analyz 	 e 	 	them	.
but	 al 	 so 	 	,	if	there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	can	not	reach	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	too	high	on	a	cliff	,	we	have	a	little	laser	system	which	will	 actual 	 ly 	 	zap	the	rock	,	 evapo 	 rate 	 	some	of	it	,	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	 analyz 	 e 	 	what	's	coming	from	that	rock	.
so	it	's	a	little	bit	like	``	star	 war 	 s 	 	,	``	you	know	,	but	it	's	real	.
it	's	real	stuff	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	to	help	you	,	to	help	the	community	so	you	can	do	 ad 	 s 	 	on	that	 r 	 over 	 	,	we	are	going	to	train	that	 r 	 over 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	serve	 cock 	 tail 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	 al 	 so 	 	on	mars	.
so	that	's	kind	of	giving	you	an	idea	of	the	kind	of	,	you	know	,	 f 	 un 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	we	are	 do 	 ing 	 	on	mars	.
i	thought	i	'd	go	to	``	the	lord	of	the	 ring 	 s 	 	``	now	and	show	you	some	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	have	there	.
now	,	``	the	lord	of	the	 ring 	 s 	 	``	 ha 	 s 	 	two	 thing 	 s 	 	 play 	 ed 	 	through	it	.
one	,	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 attract 	 ive 	 	planet	--	it	just	 ha 	 s 	 	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	of	the	 ring 	 s 	 	and	so	on	.
but	for	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	 al 	 so 	 	the	 ring 	 s 	 	have	a	special	meaning	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 believ 	 e 	 	they	represent	,	on	a	small	scale	,	how	the	solar	system	 actual 	 ly 	 	 form 	 ed 	 	.
some	of	the	 scientist 	 s 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	the	way	the	solar	system	 form 	 ed 	 	,	that	the	 s 	 un 	 	when	it	 collapse 	 d 	 	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	 create 	 d 	 	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	a	lot	of	the	dust	around	it	 create 	 d 	 	 ring 	 s 	 	and	then	the	 particle 	 s 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 ring 	 s 	 	 accumul 	 ated 	 	together	,	and	they	 form 	 ed 	 	 big 	 ger 	 	 rock 	 s 	 	,	and	then	that	's	how	the	 planet 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	 we 	 re 	 	 form 	 ed 	 	.
so	,	the	idea	is	,	by	 watch 	 ing 	 	saturn	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	our	solar	system	in	real	time	 be 	 ing 	 	 form 	 ed 	 	on	a	 small 	 er 	 	scale	,	so	it	's	like	a	test	bed	for	it	.
so	,	let	me	show	you	a	little	bit	on	what	that	saturnian	system	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
first	,	i	'm	going	to	fly	you	over	the	 ring 	 s 	 	.
by	the	way	,	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	real	stuff	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 anim 	 ation 	 	or	 any 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	taken	from	the	satellite	that	we	have	in	orbit	around	saturn	,	the	cassini	.
and	you	see	the	amount	of	detail	that	is	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 ring 	 s 	 	,	which	are	the	 particle 	 s 	 	.
some	of	them	are	 agglome 	 rating 	 	together	to	form	 large 	 r 	 	 particle 	 s 	 	.
so	that	's	why	you	have	these	 gap 	 s 	 	,	is	 be 	 cause 	 	a	small	satellite	,	you	know	,	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 form 	 ed 	 	in	that	location	.
now	,	you	think	that	 t 	 hose 	 	 ring 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	large	 object 	 s 	 	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	they	are	 ver 	 y 	 	large	in	one	dimension	;	in	the	other	dimension	they	are	paper	thin	.	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	thin	.
what	you	are	 see 	 ing 	 	here	is	the	shadow	of	the	ring	on	saturn	 it 	 self 	 	.
and	that	's	one	of	the	 satellite 	 s 	 	which	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 form 	 ed 	 	on	that	one	.
so	,	think	about	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	paper	-	thin	,	huge	area	of	 man 	 y 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 mile 	 s 	 	,	which	is	 rot 	 ating 	 	.
and	we	have	a	wide	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	kind	of	 satellite 	 s 	 	which	will	form	,	each	one	looking	 ver 	 y 	 	different	and	 ver 	 y 	 	odd	,	and	that	 keep 	 s 	 	 scientist 	 s 	 	 bus 	 y 	 	for	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	explain	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	 tell 	 ing 	 	nasa	we	need	more	money	so	we	can	explain	what	these	 thing 	 s 	 	look	like	,	or	why	they	 form 	 ed 	 	that	way	.
well	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	two	 satellite 	 s 	 	which	 we 	 re 	 	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
one	of	them	is	 call 	 ed 	 	enceladus	.
it	's	a	satellite	which	was	all	made	of	ice	,	and	we	 measur 	 ed 	 	it	from	orbit	.	made	of	ice	.
but	there	was	 some 	 thing 	 	bizarre	about	it	.
if	you	look	at	these	 strip 	 es 	 	in	here	,	what	we	call	tiger	 strip 	 es 	 	,	when	we	flew	over	them	,	all	of	a	sudden	we	saw	an	 in 	 crease 	 	in	the	temperature	,	which	 s 	 aid 	 	that	 t 	 hose 	 	 strip 	 es 	 	are	 warm 	 er 	 	than	the	rest	of	the	planet	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	we	flew	by	away	from	it	,	we	 look 	 ed 	 	back	.	and	guess	what	?
we	saw	 geyser 	 s 	 	coming	out	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	yellowstone	,	you	know	,	of	saturn	.
we	are	 see 	 ing 	 	 geyser 	 s 	 	of	ice	which	are	coming	out	of	that	planet	,	which	 indic 	 ate 	 	that	most	 like 	 ly 	 	there	is	an	ocean	,	you	know	,	 be 	 low 	 	the	surface	.
and	 some 	 how 	 	,	through	some	dynamic	effect	,	we	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	these	 geyser 	 s 	 	which	are	 be 	 ing 	 	,	you	know	,	 emit 	 ted 	 	from	it	.
and	the	reason	i	 show 	 ed 	 	the	little	arrow	there	,	i	think	that	should	say	30	 mile 	 s 	 	,	we	 decide 	 d 	 	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	ago	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	fly	the	 space 	 craft 	 	through	the	plume	of	that	geyser	so	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	measure	the	material	that	it	is	made	of	.
that	was	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	 al 	 so 	 	--	you	know	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	the	risk	of	it	,	but	it	 work 	 ed 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	well	.
we	flew	at	the	top	of	it	,	and	we	found	that	there	is	a	fair	amount	of	 organ 	 ic 	 	material	which	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 emit 	 ted 	 	in	combination	with	the	ice	.
and	over	the	next	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	keep	 orbit 	 ing 	 	,	you	know	,	saturn	,	we	are	 plan 	 ning 	 	to	get	 close 	 r 	 	and	 close 	 r 	 	down	to	the	surface	and	make	more	accurate	 measure 	 ments 	 	.
now	,	 an 	 other 	 	satellite	 al 	 so 	 	 attract 	 ed 	 	a	lot	of	attention	,	and	that	's	titan	.	and	the	reason	titan	is	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	it	's	a	satellite	 big 	 ger 	 	than	our	moon	,	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	an	atmosphere	.
and	that	atmosphere	is	 ver 	 y 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	dense	 a 	 s 	 	our	own	atmosphere	.
so	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	on	titan	,	you	would	feel	the	same	pressure	that	you	feel	in	here	.	 ex 	 cept 	 	it	's	a	lot	 cold 	 er 	 	,	and	that	atmosphere	is	 heav 	 ily 	 	made	of	 m 	 ethane 	 	.
now	,	 m 	 ethane 	 	 get 	 s 	 	people	all	 excit 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 organ 	 ic 	 	material	,	so	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	people	start	 think 	 ing 	 	,	could	life	have	 evolv 	 ed 	 	in	that	location	,	when	you	have	a	lot	of	 organ 	 ic 	 	material	.
so	people	 believ 	 e 	 	now	that	titan	is	most	 like 	 ly 	 	what	we	call	a	pre	-	biotic	planet	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	so	cold	 organ 	 ic 	 	material	did	not	get	to	the	stage	of	 be 	 coming 	 	 bio 	 logical 	 	material	,	and	 there 	 fore 	 	life	could	have	 evolv 	 ed 	 	on	it	.
so	it	could	be	earth	,	 froze 	 n 	 	three	billion	 year 	 s 	 	ago	before	life	 actual 	 ly 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	on	it	.
so	that	's	 get 	 ting 	 	a	lot	of	interest	,	and	to	show	you	some	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	what	we	did	in	there	,	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 drop 	 ped 	 	a	 prob 	 e 	 	,	which	was	 develop 	 ed 	 	by	our	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	in	europe	,	we	 drop 	 ped 	 	a	 prob 	 e 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	 orbit 	 ing 	 	saturn	.
we	 drop 	 ped 	 	a	 prob 	 e 	 	in	the	atmosphere	of	titan	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	of	an	area	 a 	 s 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	coming	down	.
just	 look 	 ed 	 	like	the	coast	of	california	for	me	.
you	see	the	 river 	 s 	 	which	are	coming	 a 	 long 	 	the	coast	,	and	you	see	that	white	area	which	 look 	 s 	 	like	catalina	 is 	 land 	 	,	and	that	 look 	 s 	 	like	an	ocean	.
and	then	with	an	instrument	we	have	on	board	,	a	radar	instrument	,	we	found	there	are	 lake 	 s 	 	like	the	great	 lake 	 s 	 	in	here	,	so	it	 look 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	like	earth	.
it	 look 	 s 	 	like	there	are	 river 	 s 	 	on	it	,	there	are	 ocean 	 s 	 	or	 lake 	 s 	 	,
we	know	there	are	 cloud 	 s 	 	.	we	think	it	's	 rain 	 ing 	 	 al 	 so 	 	on	it	.
so	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	much	like	the	cycle	on	earth	 ex 	 cept 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	so	cold	,	it	could	not	be	water	,	you	know	,	 be 	 cause 	 	water	would	have	 froze 	 n 	 	.
what	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	,	that	all	that	we	are	 see 	 ing 	 	,	all	 th 	 is 	 	liquid	,	[	is	made	of	]	 hydro 	 carbon 	 	and	ethane	and	 m 	 ethane 	 	,	similar	to	what	you	put	in	your	car	.
so	here	we	have	a	cycle	of	a	planet	which	is	like	our	earth	,	but	is	all	made	of	ethane	and	 m 	 ethane 	 	and	 organ 	 ic 	 	material	.
so	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	on	mars	--	sorry	,	on	titan	,	you	do	n't	have	to	worry	about	four	-	dollar	 gas 	 o 	 line 	 	.
you	just	drive	to	the	 near 	 est 	 	lake	,	stick	your	hose	in	it	,	and	you	've	got	your	car	 fill 	 ed 	 	up	.
on	the	other	hand	,	if	you	light	a	match	the	whole	planet	will	blow	up	.
so	in	 clo 	 s 	 ing 	 	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	i	want	to	close	by	a	couple	of	 picture 	 s 	 	.
and	just	to	kind	of	put	us	in	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	of	saturn	taken	with	a	 space 	 craft 	 	from	 be 	 hind 	 	saturn	,	looking	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
the	 s 	 un 	 	is	 be 	 hind 	 	saturn	,	so	we	see	what	we	call	``	forward	 scatter 	 ing 	 	,	``	so	it	 high 	 light 	 s 	 	all	the	 ring 	 s 	 	.	and	i	'm	going	to	zoom	.
there	is	a	--	i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	you	can	see	it	 ver 	 y 	 	well	,	but	on	the	top	left	,	around	10	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	,	there	is	a	little	 teen 	 y 	 	dot	,	and	that	's	earth	.
you	 bare 	 ly 	 	can	see	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.	so	what	i	did	,	i	thought	i	'd	zoom	on	it	.
so	 a 	 s 	 	you	zoom	in	,	you	know	,	you	can	see	earth	,	you	know	,	just	in	the	middle	here	.	so	we	 zoom 	 ed 	 	all	the	way	on	the	art	center	.
so	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
