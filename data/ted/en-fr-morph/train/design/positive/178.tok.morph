in	the	next	18	 minute 	 s 	 	,	i	'm	going	to	take	you	on	a	journey	.
and	it	's	a	journey	that	you	and	i	have	 be 	 en 	 	on	for	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	now	,	and	it	 beg 	 an 	 	some	50	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	when	 human 	 s 	 	first	 steppe 	 d 	 	off	our	planet	.
and	in	 t 	 hose 	 	50	 year 	 s 	 	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	did	we	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	 physical 	 ly 	 	set	foot	on	the	moon	,	but	we	have	 dis 	 patch 	 ed 	 	robotic	 space 	 craft 	 	to	all	the	 planet 	 s 	 	--	all	eight	of	them	--	and	we	have	 land 	 ed 	 	on	 a 	 steroid 	 s 	 	,	we	have	 rend 	 ez 	 vo 	 used 	 	with	 come 	 ts 	 	,	and	,	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	in	time	,	we	have	a	 space 	 craft 	 	on	 it 	 s 	 	way	to	pluto	,	the	body	 form 	 er 	 ly 	 	known	 a 	 s 	 	a	planet	.
and	all	of	these	robotic	 mission 	 s 	 	are	part	of	a	 big 	 ger 	 	human	journey	:	a	voyage	to	understand	 some 	 thing 	 	,	to	get	a	sense	of	our	 cosm 	 ic 	 	place	,	to	understand	 some 	 thing 	 	of	our	 origin 	 s 	 	,	and	how	earth	,	our	planet	,	and	we	,	living	on	it	,	came	to	be	.
and	of	all	the	 place 	 s 	 	in	the	solar	system	that	we	might	go	to	and	search	for	 answer 	 s 	 	to	 question 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	there	's	saturn	.	and	we	have	 be 	 en 	 	to	saturn	before	--	we	 visit 	 ed 	 	saturn	in	the	early	1980s	--	but	our	 investigation 	 s 	 	of	saturn	have	 be 	 come 	 	far	more	in	-	depth	in	detail	since	the	cassini	 space 	 craft 	 	,	 travel 	 ing 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	 inter 	 planetary 	 	space	for	seven	 year 	 s 	 	,	 glide 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	orbit	around	saturn	in	the	summer	of	2004	,	and	 be 	 came 	 	at	that	point	the	 far 	 th 	 est 	 	robotic	 out 	 post 	 	that	 human 	 ity 	 	had	ever	 establish 	 ed 	 	around	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
now	,	the	saturn	system	is	a	rich	planetary	system	.
it	 off 	 ers 	 	 myster 	 y 	 	,	scientific	 in 	 sight 	 	and	 obvious 	 ly 	 	splendor	beyond	 compar 	 e 	 	,	and	the	investigation	of	 th 	 is 	 	system	 ha 	 s 	 	enormous	 cosm 	 ic 	 	reach	.
in	fact	,	just	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	the	 ring 	 s 	 	 al 	 one 	 	,	we	stand	to	learn	a	lot	about	the	 dis 	 c 	 s 	 	of	 star 	 s 	 	and	gas	that	we	call	the	spiral	 galax 	 ies 	 	.
and	here	's	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	picture	of	the	andromeda	 nebul 	 a 	 	,	which	is	our	 close 	 st 	 	,	largest	spiral	 galax 	 y 	 	to	the	 milk 	 y 	 	way	.
and	then	,	here	's	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	composite	of	the	 whirl 	 pool 	 	 galax 	 y 	 	,	taken	by	the	hubble	space	 tele 	 scope 	 	.
so	the	journey	back	to	saturn	is	 re 	 ally 	 	part	of	and	is	 al 	 so 	 	a	metaphor	for	a	much	 large 	 r 	 	human	voyage	to	understand	the	 interconnect 	 ed 	 ness 	 	of	 every 	 thing 	 	around	us	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	how	 human 	 s 	 	fit	 in 	 to 	 	that	picture	.
and	it	 pain 	 s 	 	me	that	i	ca	n't	tell	you	all	that	we	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	with	cassini	.	i	ca	n't	show	you	all	the	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	that	we	've	taken	in	the	last	two	and	a	half	 year 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 simpl 	 y 	 	do	n't	have	the	time	.
so	i	'm	going	to	 concent 	 rate 	 	on	two	of	the	most	 excit 	 ing 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	that	have	 emerge 	 d 	 	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	major	 expl 	 or 	 atory 	 	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 	that	we	are	 conduct 	 ing 	 	around	saturn	,	and	have	 be 	 en 	 	for	the	past	two	and	a	half	 year 	 s 	 	.
saturn	is	 accompani 	 ed 	 	by	a	 ver 	 y 	 	large	and	 divers 	 e 	 	 collect 	 ion 	 	of	 moon 	 s 	 	.
they	range	in	 s 	 ize 	 	from	a	few	 kilometer 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	to	 a 	 s 	 	big	 a 	 cross 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	u.s	.
most	of	the	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	we	've	taken	of	saturn	,	in	fact	,	show	saturn	in	 accompani 	 ment 	 	with	some	of	 it 	 s 	 	 moon 	 s 	 	.	here	's	saturn	with	dione	,	and	then	,	here	's	saturn	 show 	 ing 	 	the	 ring 	 s 	 	edge	-	on	,	 show 	 ing 	 	you	just	how	 vert 	 ically 	 	thin	they	are	,	with	the	moon	enceladus	.
now	,	two	of	the	47	 moon 	 s 	 	that	saturn	 ha 	 s 	 	are	 stand 	 out 	 s 	 	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	are	titan	and	enceladus	.	titan	is	saturn	's	largest	moon	,	and	,	 un 	 til 	 	cassini	had	 arriv 	 ed 	 	there	,	was	the	largest	single	expanse	of	 un 	 explore 	 d 	 	 terra 	 in 	 	that	we	had	 remain 	 ing 	 	in	our	solar	system	.
and	it	is	a	body	that	 ha 	 s 	 	long	 intrigu 	 ed 	 	people	who	've	 watch 	 ed 	 	the	 planet 	 s 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	large	,	thick	atmosphere	,	and	in	fact	,	 it 	 s 	 	surface	environment	was	 believ 	 ed 	 	to	be	more	like	the	environment	we	have	here	on	the	earth	,	or	at	 l 	 east 	 	had	in	the	past	,	than	any	other	body	in	the	solar	system	.
 it 	 s 	 	atmosphere	is	 large 	 ly 	 	 mole 	 cular 	 	nitrogen	,	like	you	are	 breath 	 ing 	 	here	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	that	 it 	 s 	 	atmosphere	is	 suff 	 used 	 	with	simple	 organ 	 ic 	 	 material 	 s 	 	like	 m 	 ethane 	 	and	 pro 	 pane 	 	and	ethane	.
and	these	 molecule 	 s 	 	high	up	in	the	atmosphere	of	titan	get	broken	down	,	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 product 	 s 	 	join	together	to	make	 ha 	 ze 	 	 particle 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 ze 	 	is	 ubiqu 	 it 	 ous 	 	.	it	's	 complete 	 ly 	 	global	and	 envelop 	 ing 	 	titan	.
and	that	's	why	you	can	not	see	down	to	the	surface	with	our	 eye 	 s 	 	in	the	visible	region	of	the	spectrum	.
but	these	 ha 	 ze 	 	 particle 	 s 	 	,	it	was	 sur 	 mis 	 ed 	 	,	before	we	got	there	with	cassini	,	over	 billion 	 s 	 	and	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	 gent 	 ly 	 	 drift 	 ed 	 	down	to	the	surface	and	 co 	 ated 	 	the	surface	in	a	thick	 organ 	 ic 	 	sludge	.
so	like	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	,	the	titan	 equi 	 valent 	 	,	of	tar	,	or	oil	,	or	what	--	we	did	n't	know	what	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	 suspect 	 ed 	 	.	and	these	 molecule 	 s 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 m 	 ethane 	 	and	ethane	,	can	be	 liquid 	 s 	 	at	the	surface	 temperature 	 s 	 	of	titan	.	and	so	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	 m 	 ethane 	 	is	to	titan	what	water	is	to	the	earth	.
it	's	a	 condens 	 able 	 	in	the	atmosphere	,	and	so	 recogn 	 izing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 circum 	 stance 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	to	the	fore	a	whole	world	of	bizarre	 possibil 	 ities 	 	.	you	can	have	 m 	 ethane 	 	 cloud 	 s 	 	,	ok	,	and	above	 t 	 hose 	 	 cloud 	 s 	 	,	you	have	 th 	 is 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 kilometer 	 s 	 	of	 ha 	 ze 	 	,	which	prevent	any	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	from	 get 	 ting 	 	to	the	surface	.
the	temperature	at	the	surface	is	some	350	 degree 	 s 	 	 be 	 low 	 	zero	fahrenheit	.
but	 de 	 spite 	 	that	cold	,	you	could	have	rain	 fall 	 ing 	 	down	on	the	surface	of	titan	.
and	 do 	 ing 	 	on	titan	what	rain	 do 	 es 	 	on	the	earth	:	it	 carve 	 s 	 	 gull 	 ies 	 	;	it	 form 	 s 	 	 river 	 s 	 	and	 cataract 	 s 	 	;	it	can	create	 canyon 	 s 	 	;	it	can	pool	in	large	 basin 	 s 	 	and	 crat 	 ers 	 	.
it	can	wash	the	sludge	off	high	mountain	 peak 	 s 	 	and	 hill 	 s 	 	,	down	 in 	 to 	 	the	 low 	 land 	 s 	 	.	so	stop	and	think	for	a	minute	.
try	to	imagine	what	the	surface	of	titan	might	look	like	.
it	's	dark	.	high	noon	on	titan	is	 a 	 s 	 	dark	 a 	 s 	 	deep	earth	 t 	 wi 	 light 	 	on	the	earth	.	it	's	cold	,	it	's	 eer 	 ie 	 	,	it	's	 mis 	 ty 	 	,	it	might	be	 rain 	 ing 	 	,	and	you	might	be	 stand 	 ing 	 	on	the	 shore 	 s 	 	of	lake	michigan	 brim 	 ming 	 	with	paint	 th 	 inner 	 	.
that	is	the	view	that	we	had	of	the	surface	of	titan	before	we	got	there	with	cassini	,	and	i	can	tell	you	that	what	we	have	found	on	titan	,	 th 	 ough 	 	it	is	not	the	same	in	detail	,	is	every	bit	 a 	 s 	 	 fasci 	 nating 	 	 a 	 s 	 	that	story	is	.
and	for	us	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	like	--	the	cassini	people	--	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	like	a	jules	verne	adventure	come	true	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	thick	,	 extens 	 ive 	 	atmosphere	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	of	titan	,	 back 	 lit 	 	by	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	with	the	 ring 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 back 	 drop 	 	.
and	yet	 an 	 other 	 	moon	there	--
i	do	n't	even	know	which	one	it	is	.	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 extens 	 ive 	 	atmosphere	.
we	have	 instrument 	 s 	 	on	cassini	which	can	see	down	to	the	surface	through	 th 	 is 	 	atmosphere	,	and	my	camera	system	is	one	of	them	.
and	we	have	taken	 picture 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	what	you	see	is	bright	and	dark	 region 	 s 	 	,	and	that	's	about	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	it	got	for	us	.
it	was	so	 mystify 	 ing 	 	:	we	could	n't	make	out	what	we	 we 	 re 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	on	titan	.
when	you	look	 close 	 r 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	region	,	you	start	to	see	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 s 	 in 	 uous 	 	 channel 	 s 	 	--	we	did	n't	know	.	you	see	a	few	round	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	,	we	 lat 	 er 	 	found	out	,	is	,	in	fact	,	a	 crat 	 er 	 	,	but	there	are	 ver 	 y 	 	few	 crat 	 ers 	 	on	the	surface	of	titan	,	meaning	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	young	surface	.
and	there	are	 feature 	 s 	 	that	look	tectonic	.
they	look	like	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	 pull 	 ed 	 	 a 	 part 	 	.
 when 	 ever 	 	you	see	 any 	 thing 	 	linear	on	a	planet	,	it	 mean 	 s 	 	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	fracture	,	like	a	fault	.
and	so	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 tectonic 	 ally 	 	 alter 	 ed 	 	.
but	we	could	n't	make	sense	of	our	 image 	 s 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	,	six	 month 	 s 	 	after	we	got	 in 	 to 	 	orbit	,	an	event	 occur 	 red 	 	that	 man 	 y 	 	have	 regard 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 high 	 light 	 	of	cassini	's	investigation	of	titan	.
and	that	was	the	 deploy 	 ment 	 	of	the	huygens	 prob 	 e 	 	,	the	european	-	built	huygens	 prob 	 e 	 	that	cassini	had	carried	for	seven	 year 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	solar	system	.	we	 deploy 	 ed 	 	it	to	the	atmosphere	of	titan	,	it	took	two	and	a	half	 hour 	 s 	 	to	descend	,	and	it	 land 	 ed 	 	on	the	surface	.
and	i	just	want	to	 emphas 	 ize 	 	how	significant	an	event	 th 	 is 	 	is	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 de 	 vice 	 	of	human	making	,	and	it	 land 	 ed 	 	in	the	 out 	 er 	 	solar	system	for	the	first	time	in	human	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
it	is	so	significant	that	,	in	my	mind	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	an	event	that	should	have	 be 	 en 	 	 celebr 	 ated 	 	with	 tick 	 er 	 	tape	 para 	 de 	 s 	 	in	every	city	 a 	 cross 	 	the	u.s.	and	europe	,	and	 s 	 ad 	 ly 	 	,	that	was	n't	the	case	.
.	it	was	significant	for	 an 	 other 	 	reason	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 inter 	 national 	 	mission	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	event	was	 celebr 	 ated 	 	in	europe	,	in	germany	,	and	the	 celebr 	 atory 	 	 present 	 ations 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 give 	 n 	 	in	english	 accent 	 s 	 	,	and	american	 accent 	 s 	 	,	and	german	 accent 	 s 	 	,	and	french	and	italian	and	dutch	 accent 	 s 	 	.
it	was	a	moving	 demonst 	 ration 	 	of	what	the	 word 	 s 	 	``	 unit 	 ed 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	``	are	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	mean	:	a	true	 un 	 ion 	 	of	 nation 	 s 	 	 join 	 ed 	 	together	in	a	colossal	effort	for	good	.
and	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	it	was	a	massive	 under 	 taking 	 	to	explore	a	planet	,	and	to	come	to	understand	a	planetary	system	that	,	for	all	of	human	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	had	 be 	 en 	 	 un 	 reach 	 able 	 	,	and	now	 human 	 s 	 	had	 actual 	 ly 	 	 touch 	 ed 	 	it	.
so	it	was	--	i	mean	,	i	'm	 get 	 ting 	 	goose	 bump 	 s 	 	just	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	it	.	it	was	a	 tremendous 	 ly 	 	 emotion 	 al 	 	event	,	and	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	will	 personal 	 ly 	 	never	forget	,	and	you	should	n't	either	.
.	but	 any 	 way 	 	,	the	 prob 	 e 	 	took	 measure 	 ments 	 	of	the	atmosphere	on	the	way	down	,	and	it	 al 	 so 	 	took	 pan 	 ora 	 mic 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	.
and	i	ca	n't	tell	you	what	it	was	like	to	see	the	first	 picture 	 s 	 	of	titan	's	surface	from	the	 prob 	 e 	 	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	saw	.
and	it	was	a	 shock 	 er 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	 every 	 thing 	 	we	 want 	 ed 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	other	 picture 	 s 	 	taken	from	orbit	to	be	.
it	was	an	 un 	 ambigu 	 ous 	 	pattern	,	a	 geo 	 logical 	 	pattern	.
it	's	a	 den 	 dritic 	 	 drain 	 age 	 	pattern	that	can	be	 form 	 ed 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	by	the	flow	of	 liquid 	 s 	 	.
and	you	can	follow	these	 channel 	 s 	 	and	you	can	see	how	they	all	 converg 	 e 	 	.
and	they	 converg 	 e 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	channel	here	,	which	 drain 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	region	.
you	are	looking	at	a	 shore 	 line 	 	.
was	 th 	 is 	 	a	 shore 	 line 	 	of	 fluid 	 s 	 	?	we	did	n't	know	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 what 	 	of	a	 shore 	 line 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	picture	is	taken	at	16	 kilometer 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	picture	taken	at	eight	 kilometer 	 s 	 	,	ok	?	 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	 shore 	 line 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	now	,	16	 kilometer 	 s 	 	,	eight	 kilometer 	 s 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	 rough 	 ly 	 	an	 air 	 line 	 	altitude	.
if	you	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	take	an	 air 	 plane 	 	trip	 a 	 cross 	 	the	u.s.	,	you	would	be	 fly 	 ing 	 	at	these	 altitude 	 s 	 	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	picture	you	would	have	at	the	window	of	titanian	 air 	 lines 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	fly	 a 	 cross 	 	the	surface	of	titan	.
and	then	 final 	 ly 	 	,	the	 prob 	 e 	 	came	to	rest	on	the	surface	,	and	i	'm	going	to	show	you	,	 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	the	first	picture	ever	taken	from	the	surface	of	a	moon	in	the	 out 	 er 	 	solar	system	.
and	here	is	the	horizon	,	ok	?
these	are	 prob 	 ably 	 	water	ice	 pe 	 bble 	 s 	 	,	 y 	 es 	 	?
.	and	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	it	 land 	 ed 	 	in	one	of	these	flat	,	dark	 region 	 s 	 
and	it	did	n't	sink	out	of	sight	.	so	it	was	n't	fluid	that	we	 land 	 ed 	 	in	.
what	the	 prob 	 e 	 	came	down	in	was	 bas 	 ically 	 	the	titan	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	a	mud	flat	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 un 	 con 	 solid 	 ated 	 	ground	that	is	 suff 	 used 	 	with	liquid	 m 	 ethane 	 	.
and	it	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	case	that	 th 	 is 	 	material	 ha 	 s 	 	 wash 	 ed 	 	off	the	 high 	 land 	 s 	 	of	titan	through	these	 channel 	 s 	 	that	we	saw	,	and	 ha 	 s 	 	 drain 	 ed 	 	over	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	to	fill	in	low	-	 ly 	 ing 	 	 basin 	 s 	 	.
and	that	is	what	the	huygens	 prob 	 e 	 	 land 	 ed 	 	in	.
but	still	,	there	was	no	sign	in	our	 image 	 s 	 	,	or	even	in	the	huygens	'	 image 	 s 	 	,	of	any	large	,	open	bodies	of	 fluid 	 s 	 	.
where	 we 	 re 	 	they	?	it	got	even	more	 puzzl 	 ing 	 	when	we	found	 dune 	 s 	 	.
ok	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	our	movie	of	the	 equ 	 ator 	 ial 	 	region	of	titan	,	 show 	 ing 	 	these	 dune 	 s 	 	.	these	are	 dune 	 s 	 	that	are	100	 meter 	 s 	 	tall	,	 separat 	 ed 	 	by	a	few	 kilometer 	 s 	 	,	and	they	go	on	for	 mile 	 s 	 	and	 mile 	 s 	 	and	 mile 	 s 	 	.
there	's	 hundred 	 s 	 	,	up	to	a	1,000	or	1,200	 mile 	 s 	 	of	 dune 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	saharan	desert	of	titan	.
it	's	 obvious 	 ly 	 	a	place	which	is	 ver 	 y 	 	dry	,	or	you	would	n't	get	 dune 	 s 	 	.
so	 aga 	 in 	 	,	it	got	 puzzl 	 ing 	 	that	there	 we 	 re 	 	no	bodies	of	fluid	,	 un 	 til 	 	 final 	 ly 	 	,	we	saw	 lake 	 s 	 	in	the	polar	 region 	 s 	 	.
and	there	is	a	lake	scene	in	the	south	polar	region	of	titan	.
it	's	about	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	lake	ontario	.
and	then	,	 on 	 ly 	 	a	week	and	a	half	ago	,	we	flew	over	the	north	pole	of	titan	and	found	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	we	found	a	feature	here	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	caspian	sea	.
so	it	 seem 	 s 	 	that	the	 liquid 	 s 	 	,	for	some	reason	we	do	n't	understand	,	or	 dur 	 ing 	 	at	 l 	 east 	 	 th 	 is 	 	season	,	are	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	at	the	 pole 	 s 	 	of	titan	.
and	i	think	you	would	agree	that	we	have	found	titan	is	a	 remark 	 able 	 	,	 mystic 	 al 	 	place	.	it	's	 ex 	 otic 	 	,	it	's	alien	,	but	yet	 strange 	 ly 	 	earth	-	like	,	and	 hav 	 ing 	 	earth	-	like	 geo 	 logical 	 	 form 	 ations 	 	and	a	tremendous	 geo 	 graphical 	 	 divers 	 ity 	 	,	and	is	a	 fasci 	 nating 	 	world	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	rival	in	the	solar	system	for	 complex 	 ity 	 	and	 rich 	 ness 	 	is	the	earth	 it 	 self 	 	.
and	so	now	we	go	onto	enceladus	.	enceladus	is	a	small	moon	,	it	's	about	a	tenth	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	titan	.	and	you	can	see	it	here	next	to	england	,
just	to	show	you	the	 s 	 ize 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 me 	 ant 	 	to	be	a	threat	.
.	and	enceladus	is	 ver 	 y 	 	white	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	bright	,	and	 it 	 s 	 	surface	is	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 wreck 	 ed 	 	with	 fracture 	 s 	 	.	it	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 geo 	 logically 	 	active	body	.
but	the	mother	 lo 	 de 	 	of	 discover 	 ies 	 	on	enceladus	was	found	at	the	south	pole	--	and	we	're	looking	at	the	south	pole	here	--	where	we	found	 th 	 is 	 	system	of	 fracture 	 s 	 	.
and	they	're	a	different	color	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	a	different	 com 	 position 	 	.
they	are	 co 	 ated 	 	.	these	 fracture 	 s 	 	are	 co 	 ated 	 	with	 organ 	 ic 	 	 material 	 s 	 	.
 more 	 over 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	whole	,	entire	region	,	the	south	polar	region	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 elev 	 ated 	 	 temperature 	 s 	 	.	it	's	the	 hot 	 test 	 	place	on	the	planet	,	on	the	body	.
that	's	 a 	 s 	 	bizarre	 a 	 s 	 	 find 	 ing 	 	that	the	antarctic	on	the	earth	is	 hot 	 ter 	 	than	the	 tropic 	 s 	 	.
and	then	,	when	we	took	 add 	 ition 	 al 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	,	we	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	from	these	 fracture 	 s 	 	are	 is 	 suing 	 	 jet 	 s 	 	of	fine	,	 ic 	 y 	 	 particle 	 s 	 	 extend 	 ing 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 mile 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	space	.
and	when	we	color	-	code	 th 	 is 	 	image	,	to	 br 	 ing 	 	out	the	faint	light	 level 	 s 	 	,	we	see	that	these	 jet 	 s 	 	feed	a	plume	that	,	in	fact	,	we	see	,	in	other	 image 	 s 	 	,	 go 	 es 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 mile 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	space	above	enceladus	.
my	team	and	i	have	 examine 	 d 	 	 image 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	like	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	and	have	thought	about	the	other	 result 	 s 	 	from	cassini	.
and	we	have	 arriv 	 ed 	 	at	the	 con 	 clusion 	 	that	these	 jet 	 s 	 	may	be	 erupt 	 ing 	 	from	 pocket 	 s 	 	of	liquid	water	under	the	surface	of	enceladus	.
so	we	have	,	possibly	,	liquid	water	,	 organ 	 ic 	 	 material 	 s 	 	and	excess	heat	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	we	have	possibly	 s 	 tumble 	 d 	 	 up 	 on 	 	the	holy	 g 	 rail 	 	of	modern	day	planetary	exploration	,
or	in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	an	environment	that	is	 potential 	 ly 	 	 suit 	 able 	 	for	living	 organism 	 s 	 	.
and	i	do	n't	think	i	need	to	tell	you	that	the	 discover 	 y 	 	of	life	 else 	 where 	 	in	our	solar	system	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	be	on	enceladus	or	 else 	 where 	 	,	would	have	enormous	cultural	and	scientific	 implic 	 ations 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	if	we	could	 demonst 	 rate 	 	that	genesis	had	 occur 	 red 	 	not	once	,	but	twice	,	 in 	 dependent 	 ly 	 	,	in	our	solar	system	,	then	that	 mean 	 s 	 	,	by	 in 	 ference 	 	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 occur 	 red 	 	a	 stagger 	 ing 	 	number	of	 time 	 s 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	and	 it 	 s 	 	13.7	billion	year	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
right	now	,	earth	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	planet	still	that	we	know	is	 tee 	 ming 	 	with	life	.
it	is	precious	,	it	is	 un 	 ique 	 	,	it	is	still	,	so	far	,	the	 on 	 ly 	 	home	we	've	ever	known	.
and	if	any	of	you	 we 	 re 	 	alert	and	 cohere 	 nt 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	1960s	--	and	we	'd	forgive	you	,	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	n't	,	ok	--	you	would	remember	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	famous	picture	taken	by	the	apollo	8	 astro 	 nauts 	 	in	1968	.
it	was	the	first	time	that	earth	was	 image 	 d 	 	from	space	,	and	it	had	an	enormous	impact	on	our	sense	of	place	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	and	our	sense	of	 respons 	 ibility 	 	for	the	 protect 	 ion 	 	of	our	own	planet	.
well	,	we	on	cassini	have	taken	an	 equi 	 valent 	 	first	,	a	picture	that	no	human	eye	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	 s 	 een 	 	before	.
it	is	a	total	eclipse	of	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	 s 	 een 	 	from	the	other	side	of	saturn	.
and	in	 th 	 is 	 	 im 	 possibly 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	picture	,	you	see	the	main	 ring 	 s 	 	 back 	 lit 	 	by	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	you	see	the	 re 	 fract 	 ed 	 	image	of	the	 s 	 un 	 	and	you	see	 th 	 is 	 	ring	 create 	 d 	 	,	in	fact	,	by	the	 exhal 	 ations 	 	of	enceladus	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	if	that	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 brilli 	 ant 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	we	can	spot	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	image	,	sight	of	our	own	planet	,	 cradle 	 d 	 	in	the	 arm 	 s 	 	of	saturn	's	 ring 	 s 	 	.
now	,	there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 deep 	 ly 	 	moving	about	 see 	 ing 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	from	 a 	 far 	 	,	and	 cap 	 tur 	 ing 	 	the	sight	of	our	little	,	blue	-	ocean	planet	in	the	 ski 	 es 	 	of	other	 world 	 s 	 	.
and	that	,	and	the	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	of	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	that	we	gain	from	that	,	may	be	,	in	the	end	,	the	 fin 	 est 	 	reward	that	we	earn	from	 th 	 is 	 	journey	of	 discover 	 y 	 	that	 start 	 ed 	 	half	a	century	ago	.
and	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
