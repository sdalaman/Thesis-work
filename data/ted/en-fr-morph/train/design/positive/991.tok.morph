the	big	residual	is	 al 	 ways 	 	value	for	money	.
all	the	time	we	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	value	for	money	.
what	we	do	n't	look	for	is	value	for	 man 	 y 	 	,	while	we	are	generating	value	for	money	.
do	we	care	about	 t 	 hose 	 	four	billion	people	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	income	 level 	 s 	 	are	less	than	two	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	day	,	the	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	bottom	of	the	pyramid	?
what	are	the	 challeng 	 es 	 	in	 get 	 ting 	 	value	for	money	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	value	for	 man 	 y 	 	?
we	have	 de 	 scribed 	 	here	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	performance	and	the	price	.
if	you	have	money	,	of	course	,	you	can	get	the	value	.
you	can	get	a	mercedes	for	a	 ver 	 y 	 	high	price	,	 ver 	 y 	 	high	performance	.
but	if	you	do	n't	have	money	,	what	 happen 	 s 	 	?
well	,	you	are	to	ride	a	 bi 	 cycle 	 	,	 carry 	 ing 	 	your	own	weight	and	 al 	 so 	 	some	other	weight	,	so	that	you	can	earn	the	bread	for	the	day	.
well	,	poor	do	not	remain	poor	;	they	 be 	 come 	 	lower	-	middle	-	class	.
and	if	they	do	so	,	then	,	of	course	,	the	 condition 	 s 	 	improve	,	and	they	start	 rid 	 ing 	 	on	 s 	 cooter 	 s 	 	.
but	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	is	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	they	do	n't	get	much	value	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	ca	n't	afford	 any 	 thing 	 	more	than	the	 s 	 cooter 	 	.
the	issue	is	,	at	that	price	,	can	you	give	them	some	extra	value	?
a	super	value	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	ability	to	ride	in	a	car	,	to	get	that	dignity	,	to	get	that	 safe 	 ty 	 	,	 look 	 s 	 	 practical 	 ly 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	,	is	n't	it	.

let	me	confirm	what	she	 s 	 aid 	 	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	i	went	 bare 	 foot 	 	 un 	 til 	 	i	was	12	.
i	 struggle 	 d 	 	to	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	day	was	a	huge	issue	.

but	i	was	about	to	 leav 	 e 	 	the	school	,	 be 	 cause 	 	my	poor	mother	could	n't	afford	 school 	 ing 	 	.
and	it	was	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	tata	trust	,	which	 g 	 ave 	 	me	six	 rupee 	 s 	 	per	month	,	 al 	 most 	 	a	dollar	per	month	for	six	 year 	 s 	 	.
that	's	how	i	'm	 stand 	 ing 	 	before	you	.
so	that	is	the	house	of	tata	.

they	combine	all	that	.
and	it	was	that	 compass 	 ion 	 	which	 both 	 er 	 ed 	 	them	,	 be 	 cause 	 	when	he	saw	--	in	fact	,	he	told	me	about	eight	or	nine	 year 	 s 	 	ago	how	he	was	 driv 	 ing 	 	his	own	car	--	he	 drive 	 s 	 	his	own	car	by	the	way	--	and	he	saw	in	the	rain	,	a	family	like	the	one	that	i	 show 	 ed 	 	to	you	 get 	 ting 	 	 drench 	 ed 	 	with	an	infant	.
and	then	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	i	must	give	them	a	car	that	they	can	afford	,	one	 la 	 kh 	 	car	,	$	2,000	car	.	``	of	course	,	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	you	say	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	people	say	it	is	 im 	 possible 	 	,	and	that	's	what	was	 s 	 aid 	 	by	suzuki	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	oh	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	he	is	going	to	build	a	three	-	wheeler	with	 step 	 ney 	 	.
and	you	can	see	the	cartoon	here	.
well	they	did	n't	build	that	.	they	built	a	proper	car	.	nano	.
and	mind	you	,	i	'm	six	feet	half	an	inch	,	ratan	is	 tall 	 er 	 	than	me	,	and	we	have	ample	space	in	the	front	and	ample	space	in	the	back	in	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	car	.

it	is	one	 la 	 kh 	 	,	100,000	 rupee 	 s 	 	,	and	you	are	to	make	it	 with 	 in 	 	that	.	``
and	he	told	them	,	``	question	the	 un 	 question 	 able 	 	.

can	you	 believ 	 e 	 	it	?
i	still	am	told	about	 th 	 is 	 	story	of	that	single	 wipe 	 r 	 	design	in	which	he	 particip 	 ated 	 	.

and	 there 	 fore 	 	,	each	component	had	to	have	a	dual	 functional 	 ity 	 	.

but	the	current	entry	-	level	 car 	 s 	 	in	 compar 	 ison 	 	to	that	is	eight	percent	less	,	but	21	percent	more	 in 	 side 	 	space	.
and	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	was	that	--	more	from	less	--	you	can	see	how	much	more	for	how	much	less	.
when	the	model	t	was	 launch 	 ed 	 	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	by	the	way	,	all	the	 figure 	 s 	 	that	are	 adjust 	 ed 	 	to	2007	dollar	 price 	 s 	 	--	model	t	was	19,700	by	ford	.
volkswagon	was	11,333	.
and	british	motor	was	around	11,000	.
and	nano	was	,	bang	,	2,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	why	you	 start 	 ed 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	new	paradigm	shift	,	where	the	same	people	who	could	not	dream	of	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	a	car	,	who	 we 	 re 	 	 carry 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	entire	family	in	a	 s 	 cooter 	 	,	 start 	 ed 	 	 dream 	 ing 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	in	a	car	.

 th 	 is 	 	is	a	photograph	of	a	house	and	a	driver	and	a	car	near	my	own	home	.
the	driver	's	name	is	naran	.
he	 ha 	 s 	 	 b 	 ought 	 	his	own	nano	.

and	that	's	why	i	call	it	a	 transform 	 ation 	 al 	 	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
it	is	not	just	 techno 	 logical 	 	,	it	is	social	 innov 	 ation 	 	that	we	talk	about	.
and	that	is	where	,	 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	famous	theme	of	 get 	 ting 	 	more	from	less	for	more	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
i	remember	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	for	the	first	time	in	australia	,	about	one	and	a	half	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	when	 the 	 ir 	 	academy	 honor 	 ed 	 	me	with	a	 fellow 	 ship 	 	.

and	gandhian	 engineer 	 ing 	 	,	in	my	judgment	,	is	the	one	which	is	going	to	take	the	world	forward	,	is	going	to	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	,	not	just	for	a	few	,	but	for	 every 	 one 	 	.

the	indian	 clever 	 ness 	 	was	using	 it 	 s 	 	 tradition 	 al 	 	knowledge	,	 how 	 ever 	 	,	 scientific 	 ally 	 	 valid 	 ating 	 	it	and	making	that	journey	from	men	to	 mic 	 e 	 	to	men	,	not	molecule	to	 mic 	 e 	 	to	men	,	you	know	.
and	that	is	how	 th 	 is 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	come	.
and	you	can	see	 th 	 is 	 	 blend 	 ing 	 	of	 tradition 	 al 	 	medicine	,	modern	medicine	,	modern	science	.
i	 launch 	 ed 	 	a	big	program	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	csir	about	nine	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
he	is	giving	us	not	just	for	psoriasis	,	for	cancer	and	a	whole	range	of	 thing 	 s 	 	,	changing	the	whole	paradigm	.
and	you	can	see	 th 	 is 	 	indian	psoriasis	 break 	 through 	 	 obtain 	 ed 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	reverse	form	of	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	by	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	.
you	can	see	before	 treat 	 ment 	 	and	after	 treat 	 ment 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	more	from	less	for	more	and	more	people	,	 be 	 cause 	 	these	are	all	 afford 	 able 	 	 treat 	 ments 	 	now	.
let	me	just	 re 	 mind 	 	you	of	what	mahatma	gandhi	had	 s 	 aid 	 	.
he	had	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	earth	 provide 	 s 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	to	satisfy	every	man	's	need	,	but	not	every	man	's	greed	.	``	so	the	 mess 	 age 	 	he	was	giving	us	was	you	must	get	more	from	less	and	less	and	less	so	that	you	can	share	it	for	more	and	more	people	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	the	current	generation	,	but	the	future	 generation 	 s 	 	.
and	he	 al 	 so 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	would	prize	every	 invent 	 ion 	 	of	science	made	for	the	benefit	for	all	.	``	so	he	was	giving	you	the	 mess 	 age 	 	that	you	must	have	it	for	more	and	more	people	,	not	just	a	few	people	.
and	 there 	 fore 	 	,	 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	theme	,	 get 	 ting 	 	more	from	less	for	more	.
and	mind	you	,	it	is	not	 get 	 ting 	 	just	a	little	more	for	just	a	little	less	.
it	's	not	about	low	cost	.
it	's	about	ultra	-	low	cost	.
you	can	not	say	it	's	a	mere	 treat 	 ment 	 	10,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	but	 be 	 cause 	 	you	are	poor	i	'll	give	it	for	9,000	.
sorry	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	.	you	have	to	give	it	for	100	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	200	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
is	it	possible	?	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	made	possible	,	by	the	way	,	for	certain	other	different	 reason 	 s 	 	.
so	you	are	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	low	cost	,	you	are	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	ultra	-	low	cost	.
you	are	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 afford 	 ability 	 	,	you	are	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 extrem 	 e 	 	 afford 	 ability 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	four	billion	people	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	income	is	under	two	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	day	.
you	're	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	exclusive	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
you	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	inclusive	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
and	 there 	 fore 	 	,	you	're	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 increment 	 al 	 	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	you	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 disrupt 	 ive 	 	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
the	 idea 	 s 	 	have	to	be	 s 	 uch 	 	that	you	think	in	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	 term 	 s 	 	.
and	i	would	 al 	 so 	 	add	,	it	is	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	more	from	less	for	more	by	more	and	more	people	,	the	whole	world	 work 	 ing 	 	for	it	.
i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 touch 	 ed 	 	when	i	saw	a	 break 	 through 	 	the	other	day	.
you	know	,	 incub 	 ators 	 	for	 infant 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
they	're	not	 avail 	 able 	 	in	africa	.
they	're	not	 avail 	 able 	 	in	indian	 village 	 s 	 	.
and	 infant 	 s 	 	die	.
and	 incub 	 ator 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	2,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
and	there	's	a	25	-	dollar	 incub 	 ator 	 	giving	that	performance	that	had	 be 	 en 	 	 create 	 d 	 	.
and	by	whom	?
by	young	 student 	 s 	 	from	standford	university	on	an	 extrem 	 e 	 	 afford 	 ability 	 	project	that	they	had	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	.
 the 	 ir 	 	heart	is	in	the	right	place	,	like	ratan	tata	.
it	's	not	just	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	 compass 	 ion 	 	and	 pass 	 ion 	 	--	 compass 	 ion 	 	in	the	heart	and	 pass 	 ion 	 	in	the	 bel 	 ly 	 	.
that	's	the	new	world	that	we	want	to	create	.
and	that	is	why	the	 mess 	 age 	 	is	that	of	gandhian	 engineer 	 ing 	 	.
 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	i	'd	like	to	end	before	time	.
i	was	 al 	 so 	 	 af 	 raid 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	18	 minute 	 s 	 	.
i	've	still	one	and	a	half	to	go	.
the	 mess 	 age 	 	,	the	final	 mess 	 age 	 	,	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	india	 g 	 ave 	 	a	great	gift	to	the	world	.
what	was	that	?
[	in	the	]	20th	century	,	we	 g 	 ave 	 	gandhi	to	the	world	.
the	21st	century	gift	,	which	is	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	for	the	whole	world	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	is	global	economic	 melt 	 down 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	is	climate	change	--	any	problem	that	you	talk	about	is	 gain 	 ing 	 	more	from	less	for	more	and	more	--	not	 on 	 ly 	 	the	current	 generation 	 s 	 	,	for	the	future	 generation 	 s 	 	.
and	that	can	come	 on 	 ly 	 	from	gandhian	 engineer 	 ing 	 	.
so	 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	to	announce	,	 th 	 is 	 	gift	of	the	21st	century	to	the	world	from	india	,	gandhian	 engineer 	 ing 	 	.
lakshmi	pratury	:	thank	you	,	dr.	mashelkar	.
lp	:	a	quick	question	for	you	.
now	,	when	you	 we 	 re 	 	a	young	boy	in	 th 	 is 	 	school	,	what	 we 	 re 	 	your	 thought 	 s 	 	,	like	what	did	you	think	you	could	 be 	 come 	 	?
what	do	you	think	that	drove	you	?
was	there	a	vision	you	had	?	what	is	it	that	drove	you	?
ram	:	i	'll	tell	you	a	story	that	drove	me	,	that	 transform 	 ed 	 	my	life	.
i	remember	,	i	went	to	a	poor	school	,	 be 	 cause 	 	my	mother	could	not	gather	the	21	 rupee 	 s 	 	,	that	half	a	dollar	that	was	 requir 	 ed 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	 stipulate 	 d 	 	time	.
it	was	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	high	school	.
but	it	was	a	poor	school	with	rich	 teacher 	 s 	 	,	 honest 	 ly 	 	.
and	one	of	them	was	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	who	taught	us	physics	.
one	day	he	took	us	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	 s 	 un 	 	and	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	show	us	how	to	find	the	 f 	 oc 	 al 	 	length	of	a	 con 	 v 	 ex 	 	lens	.
the	lens	was	here	.	the	piece	of	paper	was	there	.	he	 move 	 d 	 	it	up	and	down	.
and	there	was	a	bright	spot	up	there	.
and	then	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 f 	 oc 	 al 	 	length	.	``
but	then	he	held	it	for	a	little	while	,	lakshmi	.
and	then	the	paper	 burn 	 ed 	 	.
when	the	paper	 burn 	 ed 	 	,	for	some	reason	he	 turn 	 ed 	 	to	me	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	mashelkar	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	if	you	do	not	diffuse	your	 energ 	 ies 	 	,	if	you	focus	your	 energ 	 ies 	 	,	you	can	 achiev 	 e 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	in	the	world	.	``	that	 g 	 ave 	 	me	a	great	 mess 	 age 	 	:	focus	and	you	can	 achiev 	 e 	 	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 who 	 a 	 	,	science	is	so	 wonder 	 ful 	 	,	i	have	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	scientist	.	``	but	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	focus	and	you	can	 achiev 	 e 	 	.
and	that	 mess 	 age 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	is	 valu 	 able 	 	for	 socie 	 ty 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	that	 f 	 oc 	 al 	 	length	do	?
it	 ha 	 s 	 	parallel	lines	,	which	are	 s 	 un 	 	 ray 	 s 	 	.
and	the	 proper 	 ty 	 	of	parallel	lines	is	that	they	never	meet	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	that	 con 	 v 	 ex 	 	lens	do	?
it	 make 	 s 	 	them	meet	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 con 	 v 	 ex 	 	lens	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	.
you	know	what	 to 	 day 	 	's	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	is	 do 	 ing 	 	?	concave	length	.
they	divide	them	 far 	 ther 	 	.
so	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	the	 less 	 on 	 	of	 con 	 v 	 ex 	 	lens	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	from	that	.
and	when	i	was	at	national	chemical	 labor 	 atory 	 	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	.
when	i	was	at	council	of	scientific	industry	research	--	40	 labor 	 ator 	 ies 	 	--	when	two	 labor 	 ator 	 ies 	 	 we 	 re 	 	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	each	other	,	i	would	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	.
and	 current 	 ly 	 	i	'm	 p 	 resident 	 	of	global	research	alliance	,	60,000	 scientist 	 s 	 	in	nine	 count 	 ies 	 	,	right	from	india	to	the	u.s.	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	build	a	global	team	,	which	will	look	at	the	global	grand	 challeng 	 es 	 	that	the	world	is	facing	.
that	was	the	 less 	 on 	 	.	that	was	the	 inspiration 	 al 	 	moment	.
lp	:	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
