in	1962	,	with	rachel	carson	's	``	silent	spring	,	``	i	think	for	people	like	me	in	the	world	of	the	making	of	 thing 	 s 	 	,	the	 can 	 ary 	 	in	the	mine	was	n't	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	.
and	so	the	question	that	we	might	not	have	 bird 	 s 	 	 be 	 came 	 	kind	of	fundamental	to	 t 	 hose 	 	of	us	 wander 	 ing 	 	around	looking	for	the	 meadow 	 lar 	 k 	 s 	 	that	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	have	all	 disappear 	 ed 	 	.
and	the	question	was	,	 we 	 re 	 	the	 bird 	 s 	 	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	?
now	,	i	'm	not	a	scientist	,	that	'll	be	 re 	 ally 	 	clear	.
but	,	you	know	,	we	've	just	come	from	 th 	 is 	 	 discuss 	 ion 	 	of	what	a	bird	might	be	.
what	is	a	bird	?
well	,	in	my	world	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	rubber	duck	.
it	 come 	 s 	 	in	california	with	a	 war 	 ning 	 	--	``	 th 	 is 	 	product	 contain 	 s 	 	 chemical 	 s 	 	known	by	the	state	of	california	to	cause	cancer	and	birth	 defect 	 s 	 	or	other	 re 	 productive 	 	harm	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	bird	.
what	kind	of	culture	would	produce	a	product	of	 th 	 is 	 	kind	and	then	label	it	and	sell	it	to	children	?
i	think	we	have	a	design	problem	.
 some 	 one 	 	heard	the	six	 hour 	 s 	 	of	talk	that	i	 g 	 ave 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	monticello	 dia 	 logues 	 	``	on	npr	,	and	 s 	 ent 	 	me	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	thank	you	note	--	``	we	 real 	 ize 	 	that	design	is	a	signal	of	 intent 	 ion 	 	,	but	it	 al 	 so 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	occur	 with 	 in 	 	a	world	,	and	we	have	to	understand	that	world	in	order	to	imbue	our	 design 	 s 	 	with	inherent	 intellig 	 ence 	 	,	and	so	 a 	 s 	 	we	look	back	at	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	state	of	 af 	 fair 	 s 	 	in	which	we	design	,	we	,	in	a	way	,	need	to	go	to	the	primordial	condition	to	understand	the	 oper 	 ating 	 	system	and	the	frame	 condition 	 s 	 	of	a	planet	,	and	i	think	the	 excit 	 ing 	 	part	of	that	is	the	good	news	that	's	there	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	news	is	the	news	of	abundance	,	and	not	the	news	of	 limit 	 s 	 	,	and	i	think	 a 	 s 	 	our	culture	 torture 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	now	with	tyrannies	and	 concern 	 s 	 	over	 limit 	 s 	 	and	fear	,	we	can	add	 th 	 is 	 	other	dimension	of	abundance	that	is	 cohere 	 nt 	 	,	driven	by	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	and	start	to	imagine	what	that	would	be	like	to	share	.	``
that	was	a	nice	thing	to	get	.
that	was	one	sentence	.
henry	james	would	be	proud	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	--	i	put	it	down	at	the	bottom	,	but	that	was	 ex 	 tempor 	 ane 	 ous 	 	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	.
the	fundamental	issue	is	that	,	for	me	,	design	is	the	first	signal	of	human	 intent 	 ions 	 	.
so	what	are	our	 intent 	 ions 	 	,	and	what	would	our	 intent 	 ions 	 	be	--	if	we	wake	up	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	we	have	 design 	 s 	 	on	the	world	--	well	,	what	would	our	 intent 	 ion 	 	be	 a 	 s 	 	a	species	now	that	we	're	the	 domin 	 ant 	 	species	?
and	it	's	not	just	 steward 	 ship 	 	and	 domin 	 ion 	 	debate	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 domin 	 ion 	 	is	 im 	 plicit 	 	in	 steward 	 ship 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	how	could	you	dominate	 some 	 thing 	 	you	had	 kill 	 ed 	 	?
and	 steward 	 ship 	 	's	 im 	 plicit 	 	in	 domin 	 ion 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	ca	n't	be	steward	of	 some 	 thing 	 	if	you	ca	n't	dominate	it	.
so	the	question	is	,	what	is	the	first	question	for	 design 	 ers 	 	?
now	,	 a 	 s 	 	 guard 	 ians 	 	--	let	's	say	the	state	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	which	 re 	 serve 	 s 	 	the	right	to	kill	,	the	right	to	be	 duplic 	 it 	 ous 	 	and	so	on	--	the	question	we	're	 ask 	 ing 	 	the	 guard 	 ian 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	is	are	we	 me 	 ant 	 	,	how	are	we	 me 	 ant 	 	,	to	secure	local	 socie 	 ties 	 	,	create	world	peace	and	 s 	 ave 	 	the	environment	?
but	i	do	n't	know	that	that	's	the	common	debate	.
commerce	,	on	the	other	hand	,	is	 relat 	 ively 	 	quick	,	 essential 	 ly 	 	creative	,	 high 	 ly 	 	effective	and	efficient	,	and	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	honest	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	ca	n't	 ex 	 change 	 	value	for	 ver 	 y 	 	long	if	we	do	n't	trust	each	other	.
so	we	use	the	 tool 	 s 	 	of	commerce	 prim 	 arily 	 	for	our	work	,	but	the	question	we	 br 	 ing 	 	to	it	is	,	how	do	we	love	all	the	children	of	all	species	for	all	time	?
and	so	we	start	our	 design 	 s 	 	with	that	question	.
 be 	 cause 	 	what	we	 real 	 ize 	 	 to 	 day 	 	is	that	modern	culture	 appear 	 s 	 	to	have	 adopt 	 ed 	 	a	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	of	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	.
if	we	come	here	and	say	,	``	well	,	i	did	n't	intend	to	cause	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	on	the	way	here	,	``	and	we	say	,	``	that	's	not	part	of	my	plan	,	``	then	we	 real 	 ize 	 	it	's	part	of	our	de	 fact 	 o 	 	plan	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	the	thing	that	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	no	other	plan	.
and	i	was	at	the	white	house	for	 p 	 resident 	 	bush	,	 meet 	 ing 	 	with	every	federal	 depart 	 ment 	 	and	 age 	 ncy 	 	,	and	i	 point 	 ed 	 	out	that	they	appear	to	have	no	plan	.
if	the	end	game	is	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	,	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	great	.	if	the	end	game	is	 merc 	 ury 	 	 tox 	 ification 	 	of	our	children	 down 	 wind 	 	of	coal	fire	 plant 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	 scuttle 	 d 	 	the	clean	air	act	,	then	i	see	that	our	education	 program 	 s 	 	should	be	 ex 	 plicit 	 ly 	 	defined	 a 	 s 	 	,	``	brain	death	for	all	children	.	no	child	left	 be 	 hind 	 	.	``	so	,	the	question	is	,	how	 man 	 y 	 	federal	 official 	 s 	 	are	ready	to	move	to	ohio	and	pennsylvania	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	?
so	if	you	do	n't	have	an	 end 	 game 	 	of	 some 	 thing 	 	 de 	 light 	 ful 	 	,	then	you	're	just	moving	 ches 	 s 	 	 piece 	 s 	 	around	,	if	you	do	n't	know	you	're	taking	the	king	.
so	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	we	could	develop	a	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	of	change	,	which	 requir 	 es 	 	 humil 	 ity 	 	.	and	in	my	business	 a 	 s 	 	an	architect	,	it	's	 un 	 fortunate 	 	the	word	``	 humil 	 ity 	 	``	and	the	word	``	architect	``	have	not	 appear 	 ed 	 	in	the	same	 para 	 graph 	 	since	``	the	fountainhead	.	``
so	if	 any 	 body 	 	here	 ha 	 s 	 	trouble	with	the	 con 	 cept 	 	of	design	 humil 	 ity 	 	,	reflect	on	 th 	 is 	 	--	it	took	us	5,000	 year 	 s 	 	to	put	 wheel 	 s 	 	on	our	 lugg 	 age 	 	.
so	,	 a 	 s 	 	kevin	kelly	 point 	 ed 	 	out	,	there	is	no	 end 	 game 	 	.
there	is	an	infinite	game	,	and	we	're	 play 	 ing 	 	in	that	infinite	game	.
and	so	we	call	it	``	cradle	to	cradle	,	``	and	our	goal	is	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	i	 present 	 ed 	 	to	the	white	house	.
our	goal	is	a	 de 	 light 	 fully 	 	 divers 	 e 	 	,	safe	,	 health 	 y 	 	and	just	world	,	with	clean	air	,	clean	water	,	 s 	 oil 	 	and	power	--	 economic 	 ally 	 	,	 e 	 quit 	 ably 	 	,	 eco 	 logically 	 	and	 elegant 	 ly 	 	 enjoy 	 ed 	 	,	period	.
what	do	n't	you	like	about	 th 	 is 	 	?
which	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	do	n't	you	like	?
so	we	 real 	 ized 	 	we	want	full	 divers 	 ity 	 	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	it	can	be	difficult	to	remember	what	de	gaulle	 s 	 aid 	 	when	 ask 	 ed 	 	what	it	was	like	to	be	 p 	 resident 	 	of	france	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	do	you	think	it	's	like	 try 	 ing 	 	to	run	a	country	with	400	 kind 	 s 	 	of	cheese	?	``
but	at	the	same	time	,	we	 real 	 ize 	 	that	our	 product 	 s 	 	are	not	safe	and	 health 	 y 	 	.
so	we	've	designed	 product 	 s 	 	and	we	 analyz 	 ed 	 	 chemical 	 s 	 	down	to	the	 part 	 s 	 	per	million	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	baby	 blank 	 et 	 	by	pendleton	that	will	give	your	child	nutrition	 in 	 stead 	 	of	alzheimer	's	 lat 	 er 	 	in	life	.
we	can	ask	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	what	is	justice	,	and	is	justice	blind	,	or	is	justice	 blind 	 ness 	 	?
and	at	what	point	did	that	uniform	turn	from	white	to	black	?

is	there	 any 	 body 	 	here	who	 do 	 es 	 	n't	breathe	?
clean	 s 	 oil 	 	is	a	critical	problem	--	the	 nitr 	 ification 	 	,	the	dead	 zone 	 s 	 	in	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	of	mexico	.
a	fundamental	issue	that	's	not	 be 	 ing 	 	 address 	 ed 	 	.

and	if	we	remember	sheikh	yamani	when	he	 form 	 ed 	 	opec	,	they	 ask 	 ed 	 	him	,	``	when	will	we	see	the	end	of	the	age	of	oil	?	``
i	do	n't	know	if	you	remember	his	answer	,	but	it	was	,	``	the	stone	age	did	n't	end	 be 	 cause 	 	we	ran	out	of	 stone 	 s 	 	.	``
we	see	that	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	 act 	 ing 	 	 ethic 	 ally 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	world	are	 out 	 perform 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	that	do	n't	.

if	we	look	at	the	world	of	 architect 	 ure 	 	,	we	see	with	mies	'	1928	tower	for	berlin	,	the	question	might	be	,	``	well	,	where	's	the	 s 	 un 	 	?	``
and	 th 	 is 	 	might	have	 work 	 ed 	 	in	berlin	,	but	we	built	it	in	houston	,	and	the	 window 	 s 	 	are	all	closed	.	and	with	most	 product 	 s 	 	 appear 	 ing 	 	not	to	have	 be 	 en 	 	designed	for	 in 	 door 	 	use	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 vert 	 ical 	 	gas	chamber	.
when	i	went	to	yale	,	we	had	the	first	energy	crisis	,	and	i	was	 design 	 ing 	 	the	first	solar	-	heated	house	in	ireland	 a 	 s 	 	a	student	,	which	i	then	built	--	which	would	give	you	a	sense	of	my	 ambit 	 ion 	 	.

 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	that	's	away	.

the	book	 it 	 self 	 	is	a	polymer	.	it	is	not	a	tree	.
that	's	the	name	of	the	first	chapter	--	``	 th 	 is 	 	book	is	not	a	tree	.	``
 be 	 cause 	 	in	 poet 	 ic 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	margaret	atwood	 point 	 ed 	 	out	,	``	we	write	our	 histo 	 ry 	 	on	the	skin	of	fish	with	the	blood	of	 bear 	 s 	 	.	``
and	with	so	much	polymer	,	what	we	 re 	 ally 	 	need	is	technical	nutrition	,	and	to	use	 some 	 thing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	elegant	 a 	 s 	 	a	tree	--	imagine	 th 	 is 	 	design	 assign 	 ment 	 	:	design	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 make 	 s 	 	oxygen	,	 sequest 	 ers 	 	carbon	,	 fix 	 es 	 	nitrogen	,	 distill 	 s 	 	water	,	 accrue 	 s 	 	solar	energy	 a 	 s 	 	fuel	,	 make 	 s 	 	complex	 sugar 	 s 	 	and	food	,	 create 	 s 	 	 micro 	 climate 	 s 	 	,	 change 	 s 	 	 color 	 s 	 	with	the	 season 	 s 	 	and	self	-	 replicate 	 s 	 	.
well	,	why	do	n't	we	knock	that	down	and	write	on	it	?
so	,	we	're	looking	at	the	same	 cri 	 ter 	 ia 	 	 a 	 s 	 	most	people	--	you	know	,	can	i	afford	it	?
 do 	 es 	 	it	work	?	do	i	like	it	?

we	're	 add 	 ing 	 	life	,	 liber 	 ty 	 	and	the	 pur 	 suit 	 	of	happiness	.
now	if	we	look	at	the	word	``	 com 	 petition 	 	,	``	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	most	of	you	've	used	it	.

the	williams	 sister 	 s 	 	compete	--	one	 win 	 s 	 	wimbledon	.

we	're	 al 	 so 	 	looking	at	 surviv 	 al 	 	of	the	 fit 	 test 	 	,	not	in	just	 com 	 petition 	 	 term 	 s 	 	in	our	modern	 con 	 text 	 	of	destroy	the	other	or	beat	them	to	the	ground	,	but	 re 	 ally 	 	to	fit	together	and	build	 niche 	 s 	 	and	have	growth	that	is	good	.
now	most	 environment 	 alist 	 s 	 	do	n't	say	growth	is	good	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	in	our	 lexic 	 on 	 	,	asphalt	is	two	 word 	 s 	 	:	 assign 	 ing 	 	blame	.
but	if	we	look	at	asphalt	 a 	 s 	 	our	growth	,	then	we	 real 	 ize 	 	that	all	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	is	 destroy 	 ing 	 	the	planetary	's	fundamental	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	 oper 	 ating 	 	system	.
so	when	we	see	e	 equal 	 s 	 	mc	 square 	 d 	 	come	 a 	 long 	 	,	from	a	poet	's	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	we	see	energy	 a 	 s 	 	physics	,	 chemist 	 ry 	 	 a 	 s 	 	mass	,	and	all	of	a	sudden	,	you	get	 th 	 is 	 	biology	.
and	we	have	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	energy	,	so	we	'll	solve	that	problem	,	but	the	biology	problem	's	 trick 	 y 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	put	through	all	these	toxic	 material 	 s 	 	that	we	 dis 	 gorge 	 	,	we	will	never	be	able	to	 re 	 cover 	 	that	.	and	 a 	 s 	 	francis	crick	 point 	 ed 	 	out	,	nine	 year 	 s 	 	after	 discover 	 ing 	 	dna	with	mr.	watson	,	that	life	 it 	 self 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	have	growth	 a 	 s 	 	a	 pre 	 condition 	 	--	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	have	free	energy	,	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	and	it	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	an	open	system	of	 chemical 	 s 	 	.
so	we	're	 ask 	 ing 	 	for	human	artifice	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	living	thing	,	and	we	want	growth	,	we	want	free	energy	from	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	and	we	want	an	open	 metabol 	 ism 	 	for	 chemical 	 s 	 	.
then	,	the	question	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	not	growth	or	no	growth	,	but	what	do	you	want	to	grow	?
so	 in 	 stead 	 	of	just	growing	 destruct 	 ion 	 	,	we	want	to	grow	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	might	enjoy	,	and	 some 	 day 	 	the	fda	will	allow	us	to	make	french	cheese	.
so	 there 	 fore 	 	,	we	have	these	two	 metabol 	 ism 	 s 	 	,	and	i	 work 	 ed 	 	with	a	german	chemist	,	michael	braungart	,	and	we	've	identified	the	two	fundamental	 metabol 	 ism 	 s 	 	.
the	 bio 	 logical 	 	one	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	you	understand	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	the	technical	one	,	where	we	take	 material 	 s 	 	and	put	them	 in 	 to 	 	closed	 cycle 	 s 	 	.
we	call	them	 bio 	 logical 	 	nutrition	and	technical	nutrition	.
technical	nutrition	will	be	in	an	order	of	 magn 	 itude 	 	of	 bio 	 logical 	 	nutrition	.
 bio 	 logical 	 	nutrition	can	supply	about	500	million	 human 	 s 	 	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	that	if	we	all	 wo 	 re 	 	birkenstocks	and	cotton	,	the	world	would	run	out	of	cork	and	dry	up	.
so	we	need	 material 	 s 	 	in	closed	 cycle 	 s 	 	,	but	we	need	to	 analyz 	 e 	 	them	down	to	the	 part 	 s 	 	per	million	for	cancer	,	birth	 defect 	 s 	 	,	 mut 	 a 	 genic 	 	 effect 	 s 	 	,	 disrupt 	 ion 	 	of	our	 immun 	 e 	 	 system 	 s 	 	,	 bio 	 degradation 	 	,	 persist 	 ence 	 	,	heavy	metal	content	,	knowledge	of	how	we	're	making	them	and	 the 	 ir 	 	production	and	so	on	.
our	first	product	was	a	 text 	 ile 	 	where	we	 analyz 	 ed 	 	8,000	 chemical 	 s 	 	in	the	 text 	 ile 	 	industry	.
using	 t 	 hose 	 	intellectual	 filter 	 s 	 	,	we	 eliminate 	 d 	 	[	7,962	.	]
we	 we 	 re 	 	left	with	38	 chemical 	 s 	 	.
we	have	since	 data 	 based 	 	the	4000	most	 common 	 ly 	 	used	 chemical 	 s 	 	in	human	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	,	and	we	're	 re 	 leas 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 data 	 base 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	public	in	six	 week 	 s 	 	.	so	 design 	 ers 	 	all	over	the	world	can	 analyz 	 e 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 product 	 s 	 	down	to	the	 part 	 s 	 	per	million	for	human	and	 eco 	 logical 	 	health	.
we	've	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	 proto 	 col 	 	so	that	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	can	 s 	 end 	 	these	same	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	all	the	way	through	 the 	 ir 	 	supply	 chain 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	when	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	most	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	we	work	with	--	about	a	trillion	 dollar 	 s 	 	--	and	say	,	``	where	 do 	 es 	 	your	stuff	come	from	?	``	they	say	,	``	 suppli 	 ers 	 	.	``
``	and	where	 do 	 es 	 	it	go	?	``
``	 custom 	 ers 	 	.	``
so	we	need	some	help	there	.
so	the	 bio 	 logical 	 	 nutrient 	 s 	 	,	the	first	 fabric 	 s 	 	--	the	water	coming	out	was	clean	 en 	 ough 	 	to	drink	.
technical	 nutrient 	 s 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	for	shaw	carpet	,	 infinite 	 ly 	 	 re 	 us 	 able 	 	carpet	.	here	's	nylon	going	back	to	 cap 	 rolactam 	 	back	to	carpet	.
biotechnical	 nutrient 	 s 	 	--	the	model	u	for	ford	motor	,	a	cradle	to	cradle	car	--	 con 	 cept 	 	car	.
 shoe 	 s 	 	for	nike	,	where	the	 upper 	 s 	 	are	 poly 	 est 	 ers 	 	,	 infinite 	 ly 	 	 recycl 	 able 	 	,	the	 bottom 	 s 	 	are	 bio 	 degradable 	 	 sole 	 s 	 	.
wear	your	old	 shoe 	 s 	 	in	,	your	new	 shoe 	 s 	 	out	.
there	is	no	finish	line	.
the	idea	here	of	the	car	is	that	some	of	the	 material 	 s 	 	go	back	to	the	industry	 fore 	 ver 	 	,	some	of	the	 material 	 s 	 	go	back	to	 s 	 oil 	 	--	it	's	all	solar	-	powered	.
here	's	a	building	at	oberlin	college	we	designed	that	 make 	 s 	 	more	energy	than	it	 need 	 s 	 	to	 oper 	 ate 	 	and	 pur 	 ifies 	 	 it 	 s 	 	own	water	.
here	's	a	building	for	the	gap	,	where	the	ancient	 grass 	 es 	 	of	san	bruno	,	california	,	are	on	the	roof	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	our	project	for	ford	motor	company	.	it	's	the	 re 	 vital 	 ization 	 	of	the	river	rouge	in	dearborn	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 obvious 	 ly 	 	a	color	photograph	.
these	are	our	 tool 	 s 	 	.	these	are	how	we	 s 	 old 	 	it	to	ford	.
we	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	ford	35	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	it	 th 	 is 	 	way	,	day	one	,	which	is	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	the	ford	taurus	here	it	is	.	it	's	the	world	's	largest	green	roof	,	10	and	a	half	 acre 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	roof	,	saving	money	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	species	to	 arriv 	 e 	 	here	.	these	are	 kill 	 de 	 er 	 	.
they	 show 	 ed 	 	up	in	five	 day 	 s 	 	.
and	we	now	have	350	-	pound	auto	 work 	 ers 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	bird	 song 	 s 	 	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
we	're	 develop 	 ing 	 	now	 proto 	 col 	 s 	 	for	cities	--	that	's	the	home	of	technical	 nutrient 	 s 	 	.
the	country	--	the	home	of	 bio 	 logical 	 	.	and	 put 	 ting 	 	them	together	.
and	so	i	will	finish	by	 show 	 ing 	 	you	a	new	city	we	're	 design 	 ing 	 	for	the	chinese	government	.
we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	12	cities	for	 chin 	 a 	 	right	now	,	based	on	cradle	to	cradle	 a 	 s 	 	 template 	 s 	 	.
our	 assign 	 ment 	 	is	to	develop	 proto 	 col 	 s 	 	for	the	housing	for	400	million	people	in	12	 year 	 s 	 	.
we	did	a	mass	energy	balance	--	if	they	use	brick	,	they	will	lose	all	 the 	 ir 	 	 s 	 oil 	 	and	burn	all	 the 	 ir 	 	coal	.
they	'll	have	cities	with	no	energy	and	no	food	.
we	 sign 	 ed 	 	a	 memor 	 and 	 um 	 	of	 understand 	 ing 	 	--	here	's	madam	deng	nan	,	deng	xiaoping	's	daughter	--	for	 chin 	 a 	 	to	adopt	cradle	to	cradle	.
 be 	 cause 	 	if	they	 tox 	 ify 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	 be 	 ing 	 	the	 low 	 est 	 	-	cost	 produce 	 r 	 	,	 s 	 end 	 	it	to	the	 low 	 est 	 	-	cost	 distribut 	 ion 	 	--	wal	-	mart	--	and	then	we	 s 	 end 	 	them	all	our	money	,	what	we	'll	discover	is	that	we	have	what	,	 effective 	 ly 	 	,	when	i	was	a	student	,	was	 call 	 ed 	 	 mutual 	 ly 	 	 assur 	 ed 	 	 destruct 	 ion 	 	.
now	we	do	it	by	molecule	.	these	are	our	cities	.
we	're	building	a	new	city	next	to	 th 	 is 	 	city	;	look	at	that	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 s 	 ite 	 	.
we	do	n't	 normal 	 ly 	 	do	green	 field 	 s 	 	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	one	is	about	to	be	built	,	so	they	 br 	 ought 	 	us	in	to	 inter 	 cede 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 the 	 ir 	 	plan	.
it	's	a	rubber	stamp	grid	that	they	laid	right	on	that	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	.
and	they	 br 	 ought 	 	us	in	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	would	you	do	?	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	they	would	end	up	with	,	which	is	 an 	 other 	 	color	photograph	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 exist 	 ing 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	now	,	and	here	's	our	proposal	.
so	the	way	we	 approach 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	we	 stud 	 ied 	 	the	 hydro 	 logy 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 care 	 fully 	 	.
we	 stud 	 ied 	 	the	 bio 	 ta 	 	,	the	ancient	 bio 	 ta 	 	,	the	current	 farm 	 ing 	 	and	the	 proto 	 col 	 s 	 	.
we	 stud 	 ied 	 	the	 wind 	 s 	 	and	the	 s 	 un 	 	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	 every 	 body 	 	in	the	city	will	have	fresh	air	,	fresh	water	and	direct	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	in	every	single	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	at	some	point	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	day	.
we	then	take	the	 park 	 s 	 	and	lay	them	out	 a 	 s 	 	 eco 	 logical 	 	 infra 	 structure 	 	.
we	lay	out	the	building	 area 	 s 	 	.
we	start	to	integrate	commercial	and	 mix 	 ed 	 	use	so	the	people	all	have	 center 	 s 	 	and	 place 	 s 	 	to	be	.
the	 transport 	 ation 	 	is	all	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	,	 every 	 body 	 	's	 with 	 in 	 	a	five	-	minute	walk	of	 mobil 	 ity 	 	.
we	have	a	24	-	hour	street	,	so	that	there	's	 al 	 ways 	 	a	place	that	's	 al 	 ive 	 	.
the	waste	 system 	 s 	 	all	connect	.
if	you	flush	a	toilet	,	your	 fec 	 es 	 	will	go	to	the	 sew 	 age 	 	 treat 	 ment 	 	 plant 	 s 	 	,	which	are	 s 	 old 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 asset 	 s 	 	,	not	 li 	 abilities 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	who	 want 	 s 	 	the	 fertil 	 izer 	 	 factor 	 y 	 	that	 make 	 s 	 	natural	gas	?
the	 water 	 s 	 	are	all	taken	in	to	construct	the	 wet 	 land 	 s 	 	for	 habit 	 at 	 	 resto 	 ration 	 s 	 	.
and	then	it	 make 	 s 	 	natural	gas	,	which	then	 go 	 es 	 	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	city	to	power	the	fuel	for	the	 cook 	 ing 	 	for	the	city	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	--	these	are	 fertil 	 izer 	 	gas	 plant 	 s 	 	.
and	then	the	 com 	 post 	 	is	all	taken	back	to	the	 roof 	 s 	 	of	the	city	,	where	we	've	got	 farm 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	what	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	is	 lift 	 ed 	 	up	the	city	,	the	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	,	 in 	 to 	 	the	air	to	--	to	 re 	 store 	 	the	native	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	on	the	 roof 	 s 	 	of	the	 building 	 s 	 	.
the	solar	power	of	all	the	 factor 	 y 	 	 center 	 s 	 	and	all	the	industrial	 zone 	 s 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	light	 roof 	 s 	 	 power 	 s 	 	the	city	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 con 	 cept 	 	for	the	top	of	the	city	.
we	've	 lift 	 ed 	 	the	earth	up	onto	the	 roof 	 s 	 	.
the	 farm 	 ers 	 	have	little	 bridge 	 s 	 	to	get	from	one	roof	to	the	next	.
we	inhabit	the	city	with	work	/	live	space	on	all	the	ground	 floor 	 s 	 	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 exist 	 ing 	 	city	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	new	city	.
