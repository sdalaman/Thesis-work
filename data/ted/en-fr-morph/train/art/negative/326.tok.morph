 a 	 s 	 	a	particle	physicist	,	i	 stud 	 y 	 	the	 element 	 ary 	 	 particle 	 s 	 	and	how	they	interact	on	the	most	fundamental	level	.
for	most	of	my	research	 care 	 er 	 	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	using	 accele 	 rator 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	electron	 accele 	 rator 	 	at	stanford	university	,	just	up	the	road	,	to	 stud 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	on	the	 small 	 est 	 	scale	.
but	more	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 turn 	 ing 	 	my	attention	to	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	on	the	largest	scale	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	'll	explain	to	you	,	the	 question 	 s 	 	on	the	 small 	 est 	 	and	the	largest	scale	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	.
so	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	about	our	twenty	-	first	-	century	view	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	what	it	's	made	of	and	what	the	big	 question 	 s 	 	in	the	physical	 science 	 s 	 	are	--	at	 l 	 east 	 	some	of	the	big	 question 	 s 	 	.
so	,	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	we	have	 real 	 ized 	 	that	the	 ordin 	 ary 	 	matter	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	--	and	by	 ordin 	 ary 	 	matter	,	i	mean	you	,	me	,	the	 planet 	 s 	 	,	the	 star 	 s 	 	,	the	 galax 	 ies 	 	--	the	 ordin 	 ary 	 	matter	 make 	 s 	 	up	 on 	 ly 	 	a	few	percent	of	the	content	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
 al 	 most 	 	a	quarter	,	or	 approximate 	 ly 	 	a	quarter	of	the	matter	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	is	stuff	that	's	 in 	 visible 	 	.
by	 in 	 visible 	 	,	i	mean	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	absorb	in	the	 electro 	 magnet 	 ic 	 	spectrum	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	emit	in	the	 electro 	 magnet 	 ic 	 	spectrum	.	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	reflect	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	interact	with	the	 electro 	 magnet 	 ic 	 	spectrum	,	which	is	what	we	use	to	detect	 thing 	 s 	 	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	interact	at	all	.	so	how	do	we	know	it	's	there	?
we	know	it	's	there	by	 it 	 s 	 	 gravit 	 ation 	 al 	 	 effect 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	 th 	 is 	 	dark	matter	 dominate 	 s 	 	the	 gravit 	 ation 	 al 	 	 effect 	 s 	 	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	on	a	large	scale	,	and	i	'll	be	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	about	the	evidence	for	that	.
what	about	the	rest	of	the	pie	?
the	rest	of	the	pie	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 myster 	 ious 	 	 sub 	 stance 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	dark	energy	.
more	about	that	 lat 	 er 	 	,	ok	.
so	for	now	,	let	's	turn	to	the	evidence	for	dark	matter	.
in	these	 galax 	 ies 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	in	a	spiral	 galax 	 y 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	most	of	the	mass	of	the	 star 	 s 	 	is	 concent 	 rated 	 	in	the	middle	of	the	 galax 	 y 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	huge	mass	of	all	these	 star 	 s 	 	 keep 	 s 	 	 star 	 s 	 	in	 circul 	 ar 	 	 orbit 	 s 	 	in	the	 galax 	 y 	 	.
so	we	have	these	 star 	 s 	 	going	around	in	 circle 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	can	imagine	,	even	if	you	know	physics	,	 th 	 is 	 	should	be	intuitive	,	ok	--	that	 star 	 s 	 	that	are	 close 	 r 	 	to	the	mass	in	the	middle	will	be	 rot 	 ating 	 	at	a	 high 	 er 	 	speed	than	 t 	 hose 	 	that	are	further	out	here	,	ok	.
so	what	you	would	expect	is	that	if	you	 measur 	 ed 	 	the	orbital	speed	of	the	 star 	 s 	 	,	that	they	should	be	 s 	 lower 	 	on	the	 edge 	 s 	 	than	on	the	 in 	 side 	 	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	if	we	 measur 	 ed 	 	speed	 a 	 s 	 	a	function	of	distance	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	time	i	'm	going	to	show	a	graph	,	ok	--	we	would	expect	that	it	 go 	 es 	 	down	 a 	 s 	 	the	distance	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	from	the	center	of	the	 galax 	 y 	 	.
when	 t 	 hose 	 	 measure 	 ments 	 	are	made	,	 in 	 stead 	 	what	we	find	is	that	the	speed	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	constant	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	function	of	distance	.
if	it	's	constant	,	that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	the	 star 	 s 	 	out	here	are	 feel 	 ing 	 	the	 gravit 	 ation 	 al 	 	 effect 	 s 	 	of	matter	that	we	do	not	see	.
in	fact	,	 th 	 is 	 	 galax 	 y 	 	and	every	other	 galax 	 y 	 	 appear 	 s 	 	to	be	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	in	a	cloud	of	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 visible 	 	dark	matter	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	cloud	of	matter	is	much	more	 spheric 	 al 	 	than	the	 galax 	 y 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	and	it	 extend 	 s 	 	over	a	much	 wide 	 r 	 	range	than	the	 galax 	 y 	 	.
so	we	see	the	 galax 	 y 	 	and	 fix 	 ate 	 	on	that	,	but	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	cloud	of	dark	matter	that	's	 domin 	 ating 	 	the	structure	and	the	 dynamic 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 galax 	 y 	 	.
 galax 	 ies 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	are	not	strewn	 random 	 ly 	 	in	space	;	they	tend	to	cluster	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	famous	cluster	,	the	 com 	 a 	 	cluster	.
and	there	are	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 galax 	 ies 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	cluster	.
they	're	the	white	,	 fuzz 	 y 	 	,	 elli 	 pt 	 ical 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	here	.
so	these	 galax 	 y 	 	 cluster 	 s 	 	--	we	take	a	 snap 	 shot 	 	now	,	we	take	a	 snap 	 shot 	 	in	a	decade	,	it	'll	look	 ident 	 ical 	 	.
but	these	 galax 	 ies 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	moving	at	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	high	 speed 	 s 	 	.
they	're	moving	around	in	 th 	 is 	 	 gravit 	 ation 	 al 	 	potential	well	of	 th 	 is 	 	cluster	,	ok	.
so	all	of	these	 galax 	 ies 	 	are	moving	.
we	can	measure	the	 speed 	 s 	 	of	these	 galax 	 ies 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	orbital	 velo 	 cities 	 	,	and	figure	out	how	much	mass	is	in	 th 	 is 	 	cluster	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	what	we	find	is	that	there	is	much	more	mass	there	than	can	be	 account 	 ed 	 	for	by	the	 galax 	 ies 	 	that	we	see	.
or	if	we	look	in	other	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	 electro 	 magnet 	 ic 	 	spectrum	,	we	see	that	there	's	a	lot	of	gas	in	 th 	 is 	 	cluster	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
but	that	can	not	account	for	the	mass	either	.
in	fact	,	there	 appear 	 s 	 	to	be	about	ten	 time 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	mass	here	in	the	form	of	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 visible 	 	or	dark	matter	 a 	 s 	 	there	is	in	the	 ordin 	 ary 	 	matter	,	ok	.
it	would	be	nice	if	we	could	see	 th 	 is 	 	dark	matter	a	little	bit	more	 direct 	 ly 	 	.
i	'm	just	 put 	 ting 	 	 th 	 is 	 	big	,	blue	blob	on	there	,	ok	,	to	try	to	 re 	 mind 	 	you	that	it	's	there	.
can	we	see	it	more	 visual 	 ly 	 	?	 y 	 es 	 	,	we	can	.
and	so	let	me	lead	you	through	how	we	can	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	here	's	an	 observ 	 er 	 	:	it	could	be	an	eye	;	it	could	be	a	 tele 	 scope 	 	.
and	suppose	there	's	a	 galax 	 y 	 	out	here	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
how	do	we	see	that	 galax 	 y 	 	?
a	ray	of	light	 leav 	 es 	 	the	 galax 	 y 	 	and	 travel 	 s 	 	through	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	for	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	before	it	 enter 	 s 	 	the	 tele 	 scope 	 	or	your	eye	.
now	,	how	do	we	deduce	where	the	 galax 	 y 	 	is	?
well	,	we	deduce	it	by	the	direction	that	the	ray	is	 travel 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	 enter 	 s 	 	our	eye	,	right	?
we	say	,	the	ray	of	light	came	 th 	 is 	 	way	;	the	 galax 	 y 	 	must	be	there	,	ok	.
now	,	suppose	i	put	in	the	middle	a	cluster	of	 galax 	 ies 	 	--	and	do	n't	forget	the	dark	matter	,	ok	.
now	,	if	we	consider	a	different	ray	of	light	,	one	going	off	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	now	need	to	take	 in 	 to 	 	account	what	einstein	 predict 	 ed 	 	when	he	 develop 	 ed 	 	general	 relat 	 ivity 	 	.
and	that	was	that	the	 gravit 	 ation 	 al 	 	field	,	due	to	mass	,	will	deflect	not	 on 	 ly 	 	the	 tra 	 ject 	 ory 	 	of	 particle 	 s 	 	,	but	will	deflect	light	 it 	 self 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	light	ray	will	not	 continu 	 e 	 	in	a	straight	line	,	but	would	 ra 	 ther 	 	bend	and	could	end	up	going	 in 	 to 	 	our	eye	.
where	will	 th 	 is 	 	 observ 	 er 	 	see	the	 galax 	 y 	 	?
you	can	respond	.	up	,	right	?
we	 extrapol 	 ate 	 	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	and	say	the	 galax 	 y 	 	is	up	here	.
is	there	any	other	ray	of	light	that	could	make	 in 	 to 	 	the	 observ 	 er 	 	's	eye	from	that	 galax 	 y 	 	?
 y 	 es 	 	,	great	.	i	see	people	going	down	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	a	ray	of	light	could	go	down	,	be	bent	up	 in 	 to 	 	the	 observ 	 er 	 	's	eye	,	and	the	 observ 	 er 	 	 s 	 ees 	 	a	ray	of	light	here	.
now	,	take	 in 	 to 	 	account	the	fact	that	we	live	in	a	three	-	dimensional	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	ok	,	a	three	-	dimensional	space	.
are	there	any	other	 ray 	 s 	 	of	light	that	could	make	it	 in 	 to 	 	the	eye	?
 y 	 es 	 	!	the	 ray 	 s 	 	would	lie	on	a	--	i	'd	like	to	see	--	 yea 	 h 	 	,	on	a	 con 	 e 	 	.
so	there	's	a	whole	ray	of	light	--	 ray 	 s 	 	of	light	on	a	 con 	 e 	 	--	that	will	all	be	bent	by	that	cluster	and	make	it	 in 	 to 	 	the	 observ 	 er 	 	's	eye	.
if	there	is	a	 con 	 e 	 	of	light	coming	 in 	 to 	 	my	eye	,	what	do	i	see	?
a	circle	,	a	ring	.	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	an	einstein	ring	.	einstein	 predict 	 ed 	 	that	,	ok	.
now	,	it	will	 on 	 ly 	 	be	a	perfect	ring	if	the	source	,	the	 deflect 	 or 	 	and	the	 eye 	 ball 	 	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	are	all	in	a	 perfect 	 ly 	 	straight	line	.
if	they	're	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 s 	 kew 	 ed 	 	,	we	'll	see	a	different	image	.
now	,	you	can	do	an	experiment	 to 	 night 	 	over	the	 re 	 ception 	 	,	ok	,	to	figure	out	what	that	image	will	look	like	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	there	is	a	kind	of	lens	that	we	can	 dev 	 ise 	 	,	that	 ha 	 s 	 	the	right	shape	to	produce	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	effect	.
we	call	 th 	 is 	 	 gravit 	 ation 	 al 	 	 lens 	 ing 	 	.
and	so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	your	instrument	,	ok	.
.
but	 ignor 	 e 	 	the	top	part	.
it	's	the	base	that	i	want	you	to	 concent 	 rate 	 	,	ok	.
so	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	at	home	,	 when 	 ever 	 	we	break	a	 wine 	 glass 	 	,	i	 s 	 ave 	 	the	bottom	,	take	it	over	to	the	machine	shop	.
we	 s 	 have 	 	it	off	,	and	i	have	a	little	 gravit 	 ation 	 al 	 	lens	,	ok	.
so	it	's	got	the	right	shape	to	produce	the	 lens 	 ing 	 	.
and	so	the	next	thing	you	need	to	do	in	your	experiment	is	grab	a	napkin	.	i	 grab 	 bed 	 	a	piece	of	graph	paper	--	i	'm	a	physicist	.
so	,	a	napkin	.	draw	a	little	model	 galax 	 y 	 	in	the	middle	.
and	now	put	the	lens	over	the	 galax 	 y 	 	,	and	what	you	'll	find	is	that	you	'll	see	a	ring	,	an	einstein	ring	.
now	,	move	the	base	off	to	the	side	,	and	the	ring	will	split	up	 in 	 to 	 	 arc 	 s 	 	,	ok	.
and	you	can	put	it	on	top	of	any	image	.
on	the	graph	paper	,	you	can	see	how	all	the	lines	on	the	graph	paper	have	 be 	 en 	 	 distort 	 ed 	 	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	kind	of	an	accurate	model	of	what	 happen 	 s 	 	with	the	 gravit 	 ation 	 al 	 	 lens 	 ing 	 	.
ok	,	so	the	question	is	:	do	we	see	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	sky	?
do	we	see	 arc 	 s 	 	in	the	sky	when	we	look	at	,	say	,	a	cluster	of	 galax 	 ies 	 	?
and	the	answer	is	 y 	 es 	 	.
and	so	,	here	's	an	image	from	the	hubble	space	 tele 	 scope 	 	.
 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 image 	 s 	 	you	are	 see 	 ing 	 	are	 ear 	 lier 	 	from	the	hubble	space	 tele 	 scope 	 	.
well	,	first	of	all	,	for	the	 gold 	 en 	 	shape	 galax 	 ies 	 	--	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	 galax 	 ies 	 	in	the	cluster	.
they	're	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	are	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	in	that	sea	of	dark	matter	that	are	 caus 	 ing 	 	the	 bend 	 ing 	 	of	the	light	to	cause	these	optical	 illusion 	 s 	 	,	or	 mi 	 rage 	 s 	 	,	 practical 	 ly 	 	,	of	the	 back 	 ground 	 	 galax 	 ies 	 	.
so	the	 streak 	 s 	 	that	you	see	,	all	these	 streak 	 s 	 	,	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 distort 	 ed 	 	 image 	 s 	 	of	 galax 	 ies 	 	that	are	much	further	away	.
so	what	we	can	do	,	then	,	is	based	on	how	much	 distort 	 ion 	 	we	see	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 image 	 s 	 	,	we	can	 calcul 	 ate 	 	how	much	mass	there	must	be	in	 th 	 is 	 	cluster	.
and	it	's	an	enormous	amount	of	mass	.
and	 al 	 so 	 	,	you	can	tell	by	eye	,	by	looking	at	 th 	 is 	 	,	that	these	 arc 	 s 	 	are	not	 center 	 ed 	 	on	individual	 galax 	 ies 	 	.	they	are	 center 	 ed 	 	on	some	more	spread	out	structure	,
and	that	is	the	dark	matter	in	which	the	cluster	is	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	,	ok	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 close 	 st 	 	you	can	get	to	kind	of	 see 	 ing 	 	at	 l 	 east 	 	the	 effect 	 s 	 	of	the	dark	matter	with	your	naked	eye	.
ok	,	so	,	a	quick	review	then	,	to	see	that	you	're	 follow 	 ing 	 	.
so	the	evidence	that	we	have	that	a	quarter	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	dark	matter	--	 th 	 is 	 	 gravit 	 ation 	 ally 	 	 attract 	 ing 	 	stuff	--	is	that	 galax 	 ies 	 	,	the	speed	with	which	 star 	 s 	 	 orbit 	 ing 	 	 galax 	 ies 	 	is	much	too	large	;	it	must	be	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	in	dark	matter	.
the	speed	with	which	 galax 	 ies 	 	 with 	 in 	 	 cluster 	 s 	 	are	 orbit 	 ing 	 	is	much	too	large	;	it	must	be	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	in	dark	matter	.
and	we	see	these	 gravit 	 ation 	 al 	 	 lens 	 ing 	 	 effect 	 s 	 	,	these	 distort 	 ions 	 	that	say	that	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 cluster 	 s 	 	are	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	in	dark	matter	.
ok	.	so	now	,	let	's	turn	to	dark	energy	.
so	to	understand	the	evidence	for	dark	energy	,	we	need	to	discuss	 some 	 thing 	 	that	stephen	 hawk 	 ing 	 	 refer 	 red 	 	to	in	the	previous	session	.
and	that	is	the	fact	that	space	 it 	 self 	 	is	 expand 	 ing 	 	.
so	if	we	imagine	a	section	of	our	infinite	 uni 	 verse 	 	--	and	so	i	've	put	down	four	spiral	 galax 	 ies 	 	,	ok	--
and	imagine	that	you	put	down	a	set	of	tape	 measure 	 s 	 	,	so	every	line	on	here	 correspond 	 s 	 	to	a	tape	measure	,	 horizon 	 tal 	 	or	 vert 	 ical 	 	,	for	 measur 	 ing 	 	where	 thing 	 s 	 	are	.
if	you	could	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	what	you	would	find	that	with	each	 pass 	 ing 	 	day	,	each	 pass 	 ing 	 	year	,	each	 pass 	 ing 	 	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	ok	,	the	distance	between	 galax 	 ies 	 	is	 get 	 ting 	 	 great 	 er 	 	.
and	it	's	not	 be 	 cause 	 	 galax 	 ies 	 	are	moving	away	from	each	other	through	space	.	they	're	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	moving	through	space	.
they	're	moving	away	from	each	other	 be 	 cause 	 	space	 it 	 self 	 	is	 get 	 ting 	 	 big 	 ger 	 	,	ok	.
that	's	what	the	expansion	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	or	space	 mean 	 s 	 	.
so	they	're	moving	further	 a 	 part 	 	.
now	,	what	stephen	 hawk 	 ing 	 	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	is	that	after	the	big	bang	,	space	 expand 	 ed 	 	at	a	 ver 	 y 	 	rapid	rate	.
but	 be 	 cause 	 	 gravit 	 ation 	 ally 	 	 attract 	 ing 	 	matter	is	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	space	,	it	 tend 	 s 	 	to	 s 	 low 	 	down	the	expansion	of	the	space	,	ok	.
so	the	expansion	 s 	 low 	 s 	 	down	with	time	.
so	,	in	the	last	century	,	ok	,	people	 debate 	 d 	 	about	 whet 	 her 	 	 th 	 is 	 	expansion	of	space	would	 continu 	 e 	 	 fore 	 ver 	 	;	 whet 	 her 	 	it	would	 s 	 low 	 	down	,	you	know	,	will	be	 s 	 low 	 ing 	 	down	,	but	 continu 	 e 	 	 fore 	 ver 	 	;
 s 	 low 	 	down	and	stop	,	 asymptot 	 ically 	 	stop	;	or	 s 	 low 	 	down	,	stop	,	and	then	reverse	,	so	it	 start 	 s 	 	to	contract	 aga 	 in 	 	.
so	a	little	over	a	decade	ago	,	two	 group 	 s 	 	of	 physicist 	 s 	 	and	 astronomer 	 s 	 	set	out	to	measure	the	rate	at	which	the	expansion	of	space	was	 s 	 low 	 ing 	 	down	,	ok	.
by	how	much	less	is	it	 expand 	 ing 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	,	say	,	a	couple	of	billion	 year 	 s 	 	ago	?
the	 start 	 ling 	 	answer	to	 th 	 is 	 	question	,	ok	,	from	these	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	was	that	space	is	 expand 	 ing 	 	at	a	 fast 	 er 	 	rate	 to 	 day 	 	than	it	was	a	few	billion	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	ok	.
so	the	expansion	of	space	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 speed 	 ing 	 	up	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	surprising	result	.
there	is	no	 persuas 	 ive 	 	 theoretic 	 al 	 	argument	for	why	 th 	 is 	 	should	happen	,	ok	.
no	one	was	 predict 	 ing 	 	 a 	 head 	 	of	time	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	's	going	to	be	found	.
it	was	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	of	what	was	 expect 	 ed 	 	.
so	we	need	 some 	 thing 	 	to	be	able	to	explain	that	.
now	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	in	the	 mathematic 	 s 	 	,	you	can	put	it	in	 a 	 s 	 	a	term	that	's	an	energy	,
but	it	's	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	type	of	energy	from	 any 	 thing 	 	we	've	ever	 s 	 een 	 	before	.
we	call	it	dark	energy	,	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	effect	of	 caus 	 ing 	 	space	to	expand	.
but	we	do	n't	have	a	good	 motiv 	 ation 	 	for	 put 	 ting 	 	it	in	there	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	ok	.
so	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 un 	 explain 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	to	why	we	need	to	put	it	in	.
now	,	so	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	then	,	what	i	want	to	 re 	 ally 	 	 emphas 	 ize 	 	to	you	,	is	that	,	first	of	all	,	dark	matter	and	dark	energy	are	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	 thing 	 s 	 	,	ok	.
there	are	 re 	 ally 	 	two	 myster 	 ies 	 	out	there	 a 	 s 	 	to	what	 make 	 s 	 	up	most	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	and	they	have	 ver 	 y 	 	different	 effect 	 s 	 	.
dark	matter	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 gravit 	 ation 	 ally 	 	 attract 	 s 	 	,	it	 tend 	 s 	 	to	 encourag 	 e 	 	the	growth	of	structure	,	ok	.
so	 cluster 	 s 	 	of	 galax 	 ies 	 	will	tend	to	form	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	all	 th 	 is 	 	 gravit 	 ation 	 al 	 	 attract 	 ion 	 	.
dark	energy	,	on	the	other	hand	,	is	 put 	 ting 	 	more	and	more	space	between	the	 galax 	 ies 	 	,
 make 	 s 	 	it	,	the	 gravit 	 ation 	 al 	 	 attract 	 ion 	 	between	them	 de 	 crease 	 	,	and	so	it	 impede 	 s 	 	the	growth	of	structure	.
so	by	looking	at	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 cluster 	 s 	 	of	 galax 	 ies 	 	,	and	how	they	--	 the 	 ir 	 	number	density	,	how	 man 	 y 	 	there	are	 a 	 s 	 	a	function	of	time	--	we	can	learn	about	how	dark	matter	and	dark	energy	compete	against	each	other	in	structure	 form 	 ing 	 	.
in	 term 	 s 	 	of	dark	matter	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	that	we	do	n't	have	any	,	you	know	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 persuas 	 ive 	 	argument	for	dark	energy	.
do	we	have	 any 	 thing 	 	for	dark	matter	?	and	the	answer	is	 y 	 es 	 	.
we	have	well	-	 motiv 	 ated 	 	 candid 	 ates 	 	for	the	dark	matter	.
now	,	what	do	i	mean	by	well	 motiv 	 ated 	 	?
i	mean	that	we	have	 mathematic 	 ally 	 	 consist 	 ent 	 	 the 	 ories 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 introduc 	 ed 	 	to	explain	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	 phenomen 	 on 	 	,	ok	,	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	have	n't	even	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	,	that	each	predict	the	 exist 	 ence 	 	of	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 weak 	 ly 	 	 interact 	 ing 	 	,	new	particle	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	you	want	in	physics	:	where	a	 predict 	 ion 	 	 come 	 s 	 	out	of	a	 mathematic 	 ally 	 	 consist 	 ent 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	that	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	for	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
but	we	do	n't	know	if	either	of	 t 	 hose 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	dark	matter	 candid 	 ate 	 	,	ok	.
one	or	both	,	who	 know 	 s 	 	?	or	it	could	be	 some 	 thing 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	.
now	,	we	look	for	these	dark	matter	 particle 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	,	after	all	,	they	are	here	in	the	room	,	ok	,	and	they	did	n't	come	in	the	door	.
they	just	pass	through	 any 	 thing 	 	.
they	can	come	through	the	building	,	through	the	earth	--	they	're	so	non	-	 interact 	 ing 	 	.
so	one	way	to	look	for	them	is	to	build	 detect 	 ors 	 	that	are	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	sensitive	to	a	dark	matter	particle	coming	through	and	 bump 	 ing 	 	it	.
so	a	crystal	that	will	ring	if	that	 happen 	 s 	 	.
so	one	of	my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	up	the	road	and	his	 collabor 	 ators 	 	have	built	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 detect 	 or 	 	.
and	they	've	put	it	deep	down	in	an	iron	mine	in	minnesota	,	ok	,	deep	under	the	ground	,	and	in	fact	,	in	the	last	couple	of	 day 	 s 	 	 announce 	 d 	 	the	most	sensitive	 result 	 s 	 	so	far	.
they	have	n't	 s 	 een 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	,	ok	,	but	it	 put 	 s 	 	 limit 	 s 	 	on	what	the	mass	and	the	 interact 	 ion 	 	strength	of	these	dark	matter	 particle 	 s 	 	are	.
there	's	going	to	be	a	satellite	 tele 	 scope 	 	 launch 	 ed 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year
and	it	will	look	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	middle	of	the	 galax 	 y 	 	,	to	see	if	we	can	see	dark	matter	 particle 	 s 	 	 annihil 	 ating 	 	and	producing	 gam 	 ma 	 	 ray 	 s 	 	that	could	be	 detect 	 ed 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
the	large	hadron	collider	,	a	particle	physics	 accele 	 rator 	 	,	that	we	'll	be	 turn 	 ing 	 	on	 lat 	 er 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	.
it	is	possible	that	dark	matter	 particle 	 s 	 	might	be	 produce 	 d 	 	at	the	large	hadron	collider	.
now	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	so	non	-	 inter 	 active 	 	,	they	will	 actual 	 ly 	 	 es 	 cape 	 	the	 detect 	 or 	 	,	so	 the 	 ir 	 	signature	will	be	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	energy	,	ok	.
now	,	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	there	is	a	lot	of	new	physics	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	signature	could	be	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	energy	,	so	it	will	be	hard	to	tell	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	for	future	 endeavor 	 s 	 	,	there	are	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	designed	 specific 	 ally 	 	to	address	the	 question 	 s 	 	of	dark	matter	and	dark	energy	--	ground	-	based	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	,	and	there	are	three	space	-	based	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	that	are	in	 com 	 petition 	 	right	now	to	be	 launch 	 ed 	 	to	investigate	dark	matter	and	dark	energy	.
so	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	big	 question 	 s 	 	:	what	is	dark	matter	?	what	is	dark	energy	?
the	big	 question 	 s 	 	facing	physics	.
and	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	you	have	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 question 	 s 	 	,
which	i	 ver 	 y 	 	much	look	forward	to	 address 	 ing 	 	over	the	next	72	 hour 	 s 	 	,	while	i	'm	here	.	thank	you	.
