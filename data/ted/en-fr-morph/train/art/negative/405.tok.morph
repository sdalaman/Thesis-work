what	technology	can	we	 re 	 ally 	 	 app 	 ly 	 	to	 reduc 	 ing 	 	global	poverty	?
and	what	i	found	was	 quit 	 e 	 	surprising	.
we	 start 	 ed 	 	looking	at	 thing 	 s 	 	like	death	rates	in	the	20th	century	,	and	how	they	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 improv 	 ed 	 	,	and	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 thing 	 s 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	.
you	'd	think	 may 	 be 	 	 anti 	 biotic 	 s 	 	made	more	 differ 	 ence 	 	than	clean	water	,	but	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	.
and	so	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 thing 	 s 	 	--	off	-	the	-	shelf	 techno 	 logies 	 	that	we	could	 eas 	 ily 	 	find	on	the	then	-	early	web	--	would	 clear 	 ly 	 	make	a	huge	 differ 	 ence 	 	to	that	problem	.
but	i	 al 	 so 	 	,	in	looking	at	more	 power 	 ful 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	and	 nano 	 technology 	 	and	genetic	 engineer 	 ing 	 	and	other	new	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	kind	of	digital	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	 be 	 came 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	the	potential	for	abuse	.
if	you	think	about	it	,	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	a	long	,	long	time	ago	we	 deal 	 t 	 	with	the	problem	of	an	individual	 ab 	 using 	 	 an 	 other 	 	individual	.
we	came	up	with	 some 	 thing 	 	--	the	ten	 command 	 ments 	 	:	 th 	 ou 	 	 s 	 halt 	 	not	kill	.
that	's	a	,	kind	of	a	one	-	on	-	one	thing	.
we	 organize 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	cities	.	we	had	 man 	 y 	 	people	.
and	to	keep	the	 man 	 y 	 	from	 tyrann 	 izing 	 	the	one	,	we	came	up	with	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	like	individual	 liber 	 ty 	 	.
and	then	,	to	have	to	deal	with	large	 group 	 s 	 	,	say	,	at	the	nation	-	state	level	,	and	we	had	to	have	mutual	non	-	 aggress 	 ion 	 	,	or	through	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 conflict 	 s 	 	,	we	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	came	to	a	rough	 inter 	 national 	 	 bar 	 gain 	 	to	 large 	 ly 	 	keep	the	peace	.
but	now	we	have	a	new	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	what	people	call	an	 a 	 symmetric 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	where	technology	is	so	 power 	 ful 	 	that	it	 extend 	 s 	 	beyond	a	nation	-	state	.
it	's	not	the	nation	-	 state 	 s 	 	that	have	potential	access	to	mass	 destruct 	 ion 	 	,	but	 individual 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 con 	 sequence 	 	of	the	fact	that	these	new	 techno 	 logies 	 	tend	to	be	digital	.
we	saw	genome	 sequence 	 s 	 	.
you	can	download	the	gene	 sequence 	 s 	 	of	 pathogen 	 s 	 	off	the	 inter 	 net 	 	if	you	want	to	,	and	 clear 	 ly 	 	 some 	 one 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	--	i	saw	in	a	science	magazine	--	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	well	,	the	1918	flu	is	too	 danger 	 ous 	 	to	fedex	around	.
if	people	want	to	use	it	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 lab 	 s 	 	for	 work 	 ing 	 	on	research	,	just	 re 	 construct 	 	it	 your 	 self 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	you	know	,	it	might	break	in	fedex	.
so	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	possible	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 deni 	 able 	 	.
so	 individual 	 s 	 	in	small	 group 	 s 	 	super	-	 empower 	 ed 	 	by	access	to	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	self	-	 replica 	 ting 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	be	 bio 	 logical 	 	or	other	,	are	 clear 	 ly 	 	a	danger	in	our	world	.
and	the	danger	is	that	they	can	cause	 rough 	 ly 	 	what	's	a	 pan 	 demic 	 	.
and	we	 re 	 ally 	 	do	n't	have	experience	with	 pan 	 demic 	 s 	 	,
and	we	're	 al 	 so 	 	not	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 a 	 s 	 	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	at	 act 	 ing 	 	to	 thing 	 s 	 	we	do	n't	have	direct	and	sort	of	gut	-	level	experience	with	.
so	it	's	not	in	our	nature	to	pre	-	act	.
and	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	 pil 	 ing 	 	on	more	technology	 do 	 es 	 	n't	solve	the	problem	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 on 	 ly 	 	super	-	 empower 	 s 	 	people	more	.
so	the	solution	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	,	 a 	 s 	 	people	like	russell	and	einstein	and	 other 	 s 	 	imagine	in	a	conversation	that	 exist 	 ed 	 	in	a	much	 strong 	 er 	 	form	,	i	think	,	early	in	the	20th	century	,	that	the	solution	had	to	be	not	just	the	head	but	the	heart	.
you	know	,	public	policy	and	moral	progress	.
the	 bar 	 gain 	 	that	 give 	 s 	 	us	 civil 	 ization 	 	is	a	 bar 	 gain 	 	to	not	use	power	.
we	get	our	individual	 right 	 s 	 	by	 socie 	 ty 	 	 protect 	 ing 	 	us	from	 other 	 s 	 	not	 do 	 ing 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	they	can	do	but	 large 	 ly 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	what	is	legal	.
and	so	to	limit	the	danger	of	these	new	 thing 	 s 	 	,	we	have	to	limit	,	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	the	ability	of	 individual 	 s 	 	to	have	access	,	 essential 	 ly 	 	,	to	 pan 	 demic 	 	power	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	have	to	have	 sens 	 ible 	 	defense	,	 be 	 cause 	 	no	 limit 	 ation 	 	is	going	to	prevent	a	crazy	person	from	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	.
and	you	know	,	and	the	 trou 	 bling 	 	thing	is	that	it	's	much	 eas 	 ier 	 	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	bad	than	to	defend	against	all	possible	bad	 thing 	 s 	 	,	so	the	offensive	uses	 re 	 ally 	 	have	an	 a 	 symmetric 	 	advantage	.
so	these	are	the	kind	of	 thought 	 s 	 	i	was	 think 	 ing 	 	in	1999	and	2000	,	and	my	 friend 	 s 	 	told	me	i	was	 get 	 ting 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 depress 	 ed 	 	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	me	.
and	then	i	 sign 	 ed 	 	a	book	contract	to	write	more	 gloom 	 y 	 	 thought 	 s 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	and	 move 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	hotel	room	in	new	york	with	one	room	full	of	 book 	 s 	 	on	the	plague	,	and	you	know	,	nuclear	 bomb 	 s 	 	 expl 	 o 	 d 	 ing 	 	in	new	york	where	i	would	be	 with 	 in 	 	the	circle	,	and	so	on	.
and	then	i	was	there	on	september	11th	,	and	i	stood	in	the	 street 	 s 	 	with	 every 	 one 	 	.
and	it	was	 quit 	 e 	 	an	experience	to	be	there	.
i	got	up	the	next	 morn 	 ing 	 	and	 walk 	 ed 	 	out	of	the	city	,	and	all	the	 sanit 	 ation 	 	 truck 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 park 	 ed 	 	on	houston	street	and	ready	to	go	down	and	start	taking	the	 rub 	 ble 	 	away	.
and	i	 walk 	 ed 	 	down	the	middle	,	up	to	the	train	station	,	and	 every 	 thing 	 	 be 	 low 	 	14th	street	was	closed	.
it	was	 quit 	 e 	 	a	 compel 	 ling 	 	experience	,	but	not	 re 	 ally 	 	,	i	suppose	,	a	surprise	to	 some 	 one 	 	who	'd	had	his	room	full	of	the	 book 	 s 	 	.
it	was	 al 	 ways 	 	a	surprise	that	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	then	and	there	,	but	it	was	n't	a	surprise	that	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	at	all	.
and	 every 	 one 	 	then	 start 	 ed 	 	writing	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	 start 	 ed 	 	writing	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	i	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 abandon 	 ed 	 	the	book	,	and	then	chris	 call 	 ed 	 	me	to	talk	at	the	 con 	 ference 	 	.	i	 re 	 ally 	 	do	n't	talk	about	 th 	 is 	 	 any 	 more 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	,	you	know	,	there	's	 en 	 ough 	 	 frust 	 rating 	 	and	 depress 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	going	on	.
but	i	 agree 	 d 	 	to	come	and	say	a	few	 thing 	 s 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	i	would	say	that	we	ca	n't	give	up	the	rule	of	law	to	fight	an	 a 	 symmetric 	 	threat	,	which	is	what	we	seem	to	be	 do 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	present	,	the	people	that	are	in	power	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	to	give	up	the	thing	that	 make 	 s 	 	 civil 	 ization 	 	.
and	we	ca	n't	fight	the	threat	in	the	kind	of	stupid	way	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	a	million	-	dollar	act	 cause 	 s 	 	a	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	of	damage	,	 cause 	 s 	 	a	trillion	dollar	 respons 	 e 	 	which	is	 large 	 ly 	 	 in 	 effective 	 	and	 argu 	 ably 	 	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	 al 	 most 	 	 certain 	 ly 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	made	the	problem	 wo 	 rse 	 	.
so	we	ca	n't	fight	the	thing	with	a	million	-	to	-	one	cost	,	one	-	to	-	a	-	million	cost	-	benefit	ratio	.
so	after	giving	up	on	the	book	--	and	i	had	the	great	honor	to	be	able	to	join	kleiner	perkins	about	a	year	ago	,
and	to	work	through	venture	capital	on	the	 innov 	 ative 	 	side	,	and	to	try	to	find	some	 innov 	 ations 	 	that	could	address	what	i	saw	 a 	 s 	 	some	of	these	big	 problem 	 s 	 	.
 thing 	 s 	 	where	,	you	know	,	a	factor	of	10	 differ 	 ence 	 	can	make	a	factor	of	1,000	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	the	 out 	 come 	 	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 amaz 	 ed 	 	in	the	last	year	at	the	 in 	 credible 	 	quality	and	 excit 	 ement 	 	of	the	 innov 	 ations 	 	that	have	come	 a 	 cross 	 	my	desk	.
it	's	 overwhelm 	 ing 	 	at	 time 	 s 	 	.	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	 thank 	 ful 	 	for	google	and	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	so	i	can	understand	at	 l 	 east 	 	a	little	of	what	people	are	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	who	come	through	the	 door 	 s 	 	.
but	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	share	with	you	three	 area 	 s 	 	that	i	'm	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	and	that	 re 	 late 	 	to	the	 problem 	 s 	 	that	i	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	in	the	wired	article	.
the	first	is	 th 	 is 	 	whole	area	of	education	,	and	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 relat 	 es 	 	to	what	nicholas	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	with	a	$	100	computer	.
and	that	is	to	say	that	there	's	a	lot	of	 leg 	 s 	 	left	in	moore	's	law	.
the	most	 advance 	 d 	 	 transistor 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	are	at	65	 nano 	 meter 	 s 	 	,	and	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	,	and	i	've	had	the	pleasure	to	invest	in	,	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	that	give	me	great	confidence	that	we	'll	extend	moore	's	law	all	the	way	down	to	 rough 	 ly 	 	the	10	 nano 	 meter 	 	scale	.
 an 	 other 	 	factor	of	,	say	,	six	in	dimensional	 r 	 eduction 	 	,	which	should	give	us	about	 an 	 other 	 	factor	of	100	in	raw	 improve 	 ment 	 	in	what	the	 chip 	 s 	 	can	do	.	and	so	,	to	put	that	in	practical	 term 	 s 	 	,	if	 some 	 thing 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	about	1,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	say	,	the	best	personal	computer	you	can	buy	,	that	might	be	 it 	 s 	 	cost	,	i	think	we	can	have	that	in	2020	for	10	 dollar 	 s 	 	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
now	,	just	imagine	what	that	$	100	computer	will	be	in	2020	 a 	 s 	 	a	tool	for	education	.
i	think	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	for	us	is	--	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	certain	that	that	will	happen	,	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	is	,	will	we	develop	the	kind	of	 education 	 al 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	and	 thing 	 s 	 	with	the	net	to	let	us	take	advantage	of	that	 de 	 vice 	 	?
i	'd	 argu 	 e 	 	 to 	 day 	 	that	we	have	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	,	but	we	do	n't	have	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 soft 	 ware 	 	for	them	.
and	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	in	retrospect	,	after	the	better	 soft 	 ware 	 	 come 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	,	and	you	take	it	and	you	run	it	on	a	ten	-	year	-	old	machine	,	you	say	,	god	,	the	machine	was	that	fast	?
i	remember	when	they	took	the	apple	mac	 inter 	 face 	 	and	they	put	it	back	on	the	apple	ii	.
the	apple	ii	was	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 cap 	 able 	 	of	running	that	kind	of	 inter 	 face 	 	,	we	just	did	n't	know	how	to	do	it	at	the	time	.
so	 give 	 n 	 	that	we	know	and	should	 believ 	 e 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	moore	's	law	's	 be 	 en 	 	,	like	,	a	constant	,	i	mean	,	it	's	just	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 predict 	 able 	 	progress	over	the	last	40	 year 	 s 	 	or	 what 	 ever 	 	.
we	can	know	what	the	 computer 	 s 	 	are	going	to	be	like	in	2020	.
it	's	great	that	we	have	 initi 	 ative 	 s 	 	to	say	,	let	's	go	create	the	education	and	 educ 	 ate 	 	people	in	the	world	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	a	great	force	for	peace	.
and	we	can	give	 every 	 one 	 	in	the	world	a	$	100	computer	or	a	$	10	computer	in	the	next	15	 year 	 s 	 	.
the	second	area	that	i	'm	 focus 	 ing 	 	on	is	the	 environment 	 al 	 	problem	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	 clear 	 ly 	 	going	to	put	a	lot	of	pressure	on	 th 	 is 	 	world	.
we	'll	hear	a	lot	more	about	that	from	al	gore	 ver 	 y 	 	 short 	 ly 	 	.
the	thing	that	we	see	 a 	 s 	 	the	kind	of	moore	's	law	trend	that	's	 driv 	 ing 	 	 improve 	 ment 	 	in	our	ability	to	address	the	 environment 	 al 	 	problem	is	new	 material 	 s 	 	.
we	have	a	 challeng 	 e 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	urban	population	is	growing	in	 th 	 is 	 	century	from	two	billion	to	six	billion	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	short	amount	of	time	.	people	are	moving	to	the	cities	.
they	all	need	clean	water	,	they	need	energy	,	they	need	 transport 	 ation 	 	,	and	we	want	them	to	develop	in	a	green	way	.
we	're	 reason 	 ably 	 	efficient	in	the	industrial	 sector 	 s 	 	.
we	've	made	 improve 	 ments 	 	in	energy	and	resource	efficiency	,	but	the	consumer	sector	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	in	america	,	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 in 	 efficient 	 	.
but	these	new	 material 	 s 	 	 br 	 ing 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	 innov 	 ations 	 	that	there	's	a	strong	 bas 	 is 	 	for	hope	that	these	 thing 	 s 	 	will	be	so	 profit 	 able 	 	that	they	can	be	 br 	 ought 	 	to	the	market	.
and	i	want	to	give	you	a	specific	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	a	new	material	that	was	 discover 	 ed 	 	15	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
if	we	take	carbon	 nano 	 tube 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	iijima	 discover 	 ed 	 	them	in	1991	,	they	just	have	 in 	 credible 	 	 proper 	 ties 	 	.
and	these	are	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	we	're	going	to	discover	 a 	 s 	 	we	start	to	engineer	at	the	nano	scale	.
 the 	 ir 	 	strength	:	they	're	 al 	 most 	 	the	 strong 	 est 	 	material	,	 ten 	 s 	 ile 	 	strength	material	known	.
they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	stiff	.	they	stretch	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	little	.
in	two	 dimension 	 s 	 	,	if	you	make	,	like	,	a	fabric	out	of	them	,	they	're	30	 time 	 s 	 	 strong 	 er 	 	than	kevlar	.
and	if	you	make	a	three	-	dimensional	structure	,	like	a	buckyball	,	they	have	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 in 	 credible 	 	 proper 	 ties 	 	.
if	you	shoot	a	particle	at	them	and	knock	a	hole	in	them	,	they	repair	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	;	they	go	zip	and	they	repair	the	hole	in	 femto 	 second 	 s 	 	,	which	is	not	--	is	 re 	 ally 	 	quick	.
if	you	shine	a	light	on	them	,	they	produce	 electric 	 ity 	 	.
in	fact	,	if	you	flash	them	with	a	camera	they	catch	on	fire	.
if	you	put	 electric 	 ity 	 	on	them	,	they	emit	light	.
if	you	run	current	through	them	,	you	can	run	1,000	 time 	 s 	 	more	current	through	one	of	these	than	through	a	piece	of	metal	.
you	can	make	both	p	-	and	n	-	type	 semi 	 conductor 	 s 	 	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	you	can	make	 transistor 	 s 	 	out	of	them	.
they	conduct	heat	 a 	 long 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	length	but	not	 a 	 cross 	 	--	well	,	there	is	no	width	,	but	not	in	the	other	direction	if	you	stack	them	up	;	that	's	a	 proper 	 ty 	 	of	carbon	fiber	 al 	 so 	 	.
if	you	put	 particle 	 s 	 	in	them	,	and	they	go	 shoot 	 ing 	 	out	the	tip	--	they	're	like	 miniatur 	 e 	 	linear	 accele 	 rator 	 s 	 	or	electron	 gun 	 s 	 	.
the	 in 	 side 	 	of	the	 nano 	 tube 	 s 	 	is	so	small	--	the	 small 	 est 	 	 one 	 s 	 	are	0.7	 nano 	 meter 	 s 	 	--	that	it	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	a	 quant 	 um 	 	world	.
it	's	a	strange	place	 in 	 side 	 	a	 nano 	 tube 	 	.
and	so	we	begin	to	see	,	and	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	business	 plan 	 s 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	,	where	the	kind	of	 thing 	 s 	 	lisa	randall	's	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	are	in	there	.
i	had	one	business	plan	where	i	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	learn	more	about	witten	's	 cosm 	 ic 	 	dimension	 string 	 s 	 	to	try	to	understand	what	the	 phenomen 	 on 	 	was	going	on	in	 th 	 is 	 	 pro 	 posed 	 	 nano 	 material 	 	.
so	 in 	 side 	 	of	a	 nano 	 tube 	 	,	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	at	the	limit	here	.
so	what	we	see	is	with	these	and	other	new	 material 	 s 	 	that	we	can	do	 thing 	 s 	 	with	different	 proper 	 ties 	 	--	 light 	 er 	 	,	 strong 	 er 	 	--	and	 app 	 ly 	 	these	new	 material 	 s 	 	to	the	 environment 	 al 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	.
new	 material 	 s 	 	that	can	make	water	,	new	 material 	 s 	 	that	can	make	fuel	 cell 	 s 	 	work	better	,	new	 material 	 s 	 	that	catalyze	chemical	 react 	 ions 	 	,	that	cut	 poll 	 ution 	 	and	so	on	.
ethanol	--	new	ways	of	making	ethanol	.
new	ways	of	making	electric	 transport 	 ation 	 	.
the	whole	green	dream	--	 be 	 cause 	 	it	can	be	 profit 	 able 	 	.
and	we	've	 dedicate 	 d 	 	--	we	've	just	raised	a	new	fund	,	we	 dedicate 	 d 	 	100	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 invest 	 ments 	 	.
we	 believ 	 e 	 	that	genentech	,	the	compaq	,	the	 lot 	 us 	 	,	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	the	netscape	,	the	amazon	,	the	google	in	these	 field 	 s 	 	are	yet	to	be	found	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 material 	 s 	 	revolution	will	drive	these	 thing 	 s 	 	forward	.
the	third	area	that	we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	on	,	and	we	just	 announce 	 d 	 	last	week	--	we	 we 	 re 	 	all	in	new	york	.
we	raised	200	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	a	 special 	 ty 	 	fund	to	work	on	a	 pan 	 demic 	 	in	 bio 	 defense 	 	.
and	to	give	you	an	idea	of	the	last	fund	that	kleiner	raised	was	a	$	400	million	fund	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	for	us	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 sub 	 stantial 	 	fund	.
and	what	we	did	,	over	the	last	few	 month 	 s 	 	--	well	,	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	ago	,	ray	kurzweil	and	i	wrote	an	op	-	ed	in	the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	about	how	 publish 	 ing 	 	the	1918	genome	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
and	john	doerr	and	brook	and	 other 	 s 	 	got	 concern 	 ed 	 	,	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	,	and	we	 start 	 ed 	 	looking	around	at	what	the	world	was	 do 	 ing 	 	about	 be 	 ing 	 	prepared	for	a	 pan 	 demic 	 	.	and	we	saw	a	lot	of	 gap 	 s 	 	.
and	so	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	you	know	,	can	we	find	 innov 	 ative 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	will	go	fill	these	 gap 	 s 	 	?	and	brooks	told	me	in	a	break	here	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	he	's	found	so	much	stuff	he	ca	n't	sleep	,
 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	so	 man 	 y 	 	great	 techno 	 logies 	 	out	there	,	we	're	 essential 	 ly 	 	buried	.	and	we	need	them	,	you	know	.
we	have	one	 anti 	 viral 	 	that	people	are	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 stock 	 pil 	 ing 	 	that	still	 work 	 s 	 	,	 rough 	 ly 	 	.	that	's	tamiflu	.
but	tamiflu	--	the	virus	is	resistant	.	it	is	resistant	to	tamiflu	.
we	've	 discover 	 ed 	 	with	 aid 	 s 	 	we	need	 cock 	 tail 	 s 	 	to	work	well	so	that	the	viral	 resist 	 ance 	 	--	we	need	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	anti	-	virals	.
we	need	better	 sur 	 veil 	 lance 	 	.
we	need	 network 	 s 	 	that	can	find	out	what	's	going	on	.
we	need	rapid	 diagnos 	 tics 	 	so	that	we	can	tell	if	 some 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 s 	 train 	 	of	flu	which	we	have	 on 	 ly 	 	identified	 ver 	 y 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	.
we	've	got	to	be	able	to	make	the	rapid	 diagnos 	 tics 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
we	need	new	anti	-	virals	and	 cock 	 tail 	 s 	 	.	we	need	new	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 vaccin 	 es 	 	.
 vaccin 	 es 	 	that	are	broad	spectrum	.
 vaccin 	 es 	 	that	we	can	 manufactur 	 e 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
 cock 	 tail 	 s 	 	,	more	 poly 	 valent 	 	 vaccin 	 es 	 	.
you	 normal 	 ly 	 	get	a	 tri 	 valent 	 	 vaccin 	 e 	 	against	three	possible	 s 	 train 	 s 	 	.
we	need	--	we	do	n't	know	where	 th 	 is 	 	thing	is	going	.
we	 believ 	 e 	 	that	if	we	could	fill	these	10	 gap 	 s 	 	,	we	have	a	chance	to	help	 re 	 ally 	 	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	risk	of	a	 pan 	 demic 	 	.
and	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	a	normal	flu	season	and	a	 pan 	 demic 	 	is	about	a	factor	of	1,000	in	 death 	 s 	 	and	 certain 	 ly 	 	enormous	economic	impact	.
so	we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	think	we	can	fund	10	,	or	speed	up	10	 project 	 s 	 	and	see	them	come	to	market	in	the	next	couple	 year 	 s 	 	that	will	address	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	if	we	can	address	,	use	technology	,	help	address	education	,	help	address	the	environment	,	help	address	the	 pan 	 demic 	 	,	 do 	 es 	 	that	solve	the	 large 	 r 	 	problem	that	i	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	in	the	wired	article	?	and	i	'm	 af 	 raid 	 	the	answer	is	 re 	 ally 	 	no	,
 be 	 cause 	 	you	ca	n't	solve	a	problem	with	the	management	of	technology	with	more	technology	.
if	we	let	an	 un 	 limit 	 ed 	 	amount	of	power	loose	,	then	we	will	--	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	number	of	people	will	be	able	to	abuse	it	.
we	ca	n't	fight	at	a	million	-	to	-	one	 dis 	 advantage 	 	.
so	what	we	need	to	do	is	,	we	need	better	policy	.
and	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	some	 thing 	 s 	 	we	could	do	that	would	be	policy	 solution 	 s 	 	which	are	not	 re 	 ally 	 	in	the	 politic 	 al 	 	air	right	now	but	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	with	the	change	of	 administr 	 ation 	 	would	be	--	use	 market 	 s 	 	.
 market 	 s 	 	are	a	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	force	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 regulat 	 e 	 	away	 problem 	 s 	 	,	which	 prob 	 ably 	 	wo	n't	work	,	if	we	could	price	 in 	 to 	 	the	cost	of	 do 	 ing 	 	business	,	the	cost	of	 catastroph 	 e 	 	,	so	that	people	who	are	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	had	a	 high 	 er 	 	cost	of	 catastroph 	 e 	 	would	have	to	take	 insur 	 ance 	 	against	that	risk	.
so	if	you	 want 	 ed 	 	to	put	a	drug	on	the	market	you	could	put	it	on	.
but	it	would	n't	have	to	be	approved	by	 regulat 	 ors 	 	;	you	'd	have	to	 con 	 vince 	 	an	 actu 	 ary 	 	that	it	would	be	safe	.
and	if	you	 app 	 ly 	 	the	 not 	 ion 	 	of	 insur 	 ance 	 	more	 broad 	 ly 	 	,	you	can	use	a	more	 power 	 ful 	 	force	,	a	market	force	,	to	provide	 feed 	 back 	 	.
how	could	you	keep	the	law	?
i	think	the	law	would	be	a	 re 	 ally 	 	good	thing	to	keep	.
well	,	you	have	to	hold	people	 account 	 able 	 	.
the	law	 requir 	 es 	 	 account 	 ability 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	 techno 	 logists 	 	,	 business 	 men 	 	,	 engineer 	 s 	 	do	n't	have	any	personal	 respons 	 ibility 	 	for	the	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 action 	 s 	 	.
so	if	you	tie	that	--	you	have	to	tie	that	back	with	the	law	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	i	think	we	have	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	--	it	's	 al 	 most 	 	 un 	 accept 	 able 	 	to	say	 th 	 is 	 	--	which	,	we	have	to	begin	to	design	the	future	.
we	ca	n't	pick	the	future	,	but	we	can	steer	the	future	.
our	 invest 	 ment 	 	in	 try 	 ing 	 	to	prevent	 pan 	 demic 	 	flu	is	 affect 	 ing 	 	the	 distribut 	 ion 	 	of	possible	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	.
we	may	not	be	able	to	stop	it	,	but	the	 like 	 li 	 hood 	 	that	it	will	get	past	us	is	lower	if	we	focus	on	that	problem	.
so	we	can	design	the	future	if	we	 choos 	 e 	 	what	kind	of	 thing 	 s 	 	we	want	to	have	happen	and	not	have	happen	,	and	steer	us	to	a	lower	-	risk	place	.
vice	 p 	 resident 	 	gore	will	talk	about	how	we	could	steer	the	climate	 tra 	 ject 	 ory 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	lower	 prob 	 ability 	 	of	 catastroph 	 ic 	 	risk	.
but	above	all	,	what	we	have	to	do	is	we	have	to	help	the	good	 guy 	 s 	 	,	the	people	on	the	defensive	side	,	have	an	advantage	over	the	people	who	want	to	abuse	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	what	we	have	to	do	to	do	that	is	we	have	to	limit	access	to	certain	information	.
and	growing	up	 a 	 s 	 	we	have	,	and	 hold 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	high	the	value	of	free	speech	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	hard	thing	for	us	to	accept	--	for	all	of	us	to	accept	.
it	's	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	hard	for	the	 scientist 	 s 	 	to	accept	who	still	remember	,	you	know	,	galileo	 essential 	 ly 	 	 lock 	 ed 	 	up	,	and	who	are	still	 fight 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	battle	against	the	church	.
but	that	's	the	price	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	 civil 	 ization 	 	.
the	price	of	 retain 	 ing 	 	the	rule	of	law	is	to	limit	the	access	to	the	great	and	kind	of	 un 	 brid 	 led 	 	power	.
thank	you	.
