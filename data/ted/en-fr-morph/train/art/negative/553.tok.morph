i	'm	here	 be 	 cause 	 	i	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 mess 	 age 	 	:
i	think	we	have	found
the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	factor	for	success	.
and	it	was	found	close	to	here	,	stanford	.
 psycho 	 logy 	 	professor	took	 kid 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	four	 year 	 s 	 	old
and	put	them	in	a	room	all	by	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
and	he	would	tell	the	child	,	a	four	-	year	-	old	kid	,
``	johnny	,	i	am	going	to	 leav 	 e 	 	you	here	with	a	 marsh 	 mal 	 low 	 
for	15	 minute 	 s 	 	.
if	,	after	i	come	back	,	 th 	 is 	 	 marsh 	 mal 	 low 	 	is	here	,	you	will	get	 an 	 other 	 	one	.	so	you	will	have	two	.	``	to	tell	a	four	-	year	-	old	kid	to	wait	15	 minute 	 s 	 	for	 some 	 thing 	 	that	they	like	,	is	 equi 	 valent 	 	to	 tell 	 ing 	 	us	,	``	we	'll	 br 	 ing 	 	you	coffee	in	two	 hour 	 s 	 	.	``	exact	 equi 	 valent 	 	.
so	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	when	the	professor	left	the	room	?
 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	the	door	closed	...
two	out	of	three	ate	the	 marsh 	 mal 	 low 	 	.
five	 second 	 s 	 	,	10	 second 	 s 	 	,	40	 second 	 s 	 	,	50	 second 	 s 	 	,	two	 minute 	 s 	 	,	four	 minute 	 s 	 	,	eight	 minute 	 s 	 	.
some	 last 	 ed 	 	14	-	and	-	a	-	half	 minute 	 s 	 	.
could	n't	do	it	.	could	not	wait	.
what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	that	one	out	of	three	would	look	at	the	 marsh 	 mal 	 low 	 	and	go	like	 th 	 is 	 	...
would	look	at	it	.
put	it	back	.
they	would	walk	around	.	they	would	play	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 skirt 	 s 	 	and	pants	.
that	child	 al 	 ready 	 	,	at	four	,	 under 	 stood 	 	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	principle	for	success	,
which	is	the	ability	to	delay	 grat 	 ification 	 	.
self	-	discipline	:	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	factor	for	success	.
15	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	14	or	15	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,
follow	-	up	 stud 	 y 	 	.
what	did	they	find	?
they	went	to	look	for	these	 kid 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	now	18	and	19	.
and	they	found	that	100	percent	of	the	children	that	had	not	eaten	the	 marsh 	 mal 	 low 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	.
they	had	good	 grade 	 s 	 	.	they	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	happy	.	they	had	 the 	 ir 	 	 plan 	 s 	 	.
they	had	good	 relationship 	 s 	 	with	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	,	 student 	 s 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	fine	.
a	great	 percent 	 age 	 	of	the	 kid 	 s 	 	that	ate	the	 marsh 	 mal 	 low 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	in	trouble	.
they	did	not	make	it	to	university	.
they	had	bad	 grade 	 s 	 	.	some	of	them	 drop 	 ped 	 	out	.
a	few	 we 	 re 	 	still	there	with	bad	 grade 	 s 	 	.
a	few	had	good	 grade 	 s 	 	.
i	had	a	question	in	my	mind	:	would	hispanic	 kid 	 s 	 
react	the	same	way	 a 	 s 	 	the	american	 kid 	 s 	 	?
so	i	went	to	colombia	.	and	i	 re 	 produce 	 d 	 	the	experiment	.
and	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	funny	.	i	used	four	,	five	and	six	 year 	 s 	 	old	 kid 	 s 	 	.
and	let	me	show	you	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
so	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	colombia	?
hispanic	 kid 	 s 	 	,	two	out	of	three	ate	the	 marsh 	 mal 	 low 	 	;
one	out	of	three	did	not	.
 th 	 is 	 	little	girl	was	 interest 	 ing 	 	;
she	ate	the	 in 	 side 	 	of	the	 marsh 	 mal 	 low 	 	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	she	 want 	 ed 	 	us	to	think	that	she	had	not	eaten	it	,	so	she	would	get	two	.
but	she	ate	it	.
so	we	know	she	'll	be	 success 	 ful 	 	.	but	we	have	to	watch	her	.
she	should	not	go	 in 	 to 	 	 bank 	 ing 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,
or	work	at	a	cash	register	.
but	she	will	be	 success 	 ful 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 appli 	 es 	 	for	 every 	 thing 	 	.	even	in	 sale 	 s 	 	.
the	 sale 	 s 	 	person	that	--
the	 custom 	 er 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	want	that	.	``	and	the	person	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	here	you	are	.	``
that	person	ate	the	 marsh 	 mal 	 low 	 	.
if	the	 sale 	 s 	 	person	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	wait	a	second	.	let	me	ask	you	a	few	 question 	 s 	 	to	see	if	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	good	choice	.	``	then	you	sell	a	lot	more	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 application 	 s 	 	in	all	 walk 	 s 	 	of	life	.
i	end	with	--	the	koreans	did	 th 	 is 	 	.	you	know	what	?	 th 	 is 	 	is	so	good	that	we	want	a	 marsh 	 mal 	 low 	 	book	for	children	.
we	did	one	for	children	.	and	now	it	is	all	over	korea	.
they	are	 teach 	 ing 	 	these	 kid 	 s 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	principle	.
and	we	need	to	learn	that	principle	here	in	the	 state 	 s 	 	,
 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	a	big	debt	.
we	are	eating	more	 marsh 	 mal 	 low 	 s 	 	than	we	are	producing	.
thank	you	so	much	.
