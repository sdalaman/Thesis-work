the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	big	.
we	live	in	a	 galax 	 y 	 	,	the	 milk 	 y 	 	way	 galax 	 y 	 	.
there	are	about	a	hundred	billion	 star 	 s 	 	in	the	 milk 	 y 	 	way	 galax 	 y 	 	.
and	if	you	take	a	camera	and	you	point	it	at	a	random	part	of	the	sky	,	and	you	just	keep	the	 shut 	 ter 	 	open	,	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	your	camera	is	 attach 	 ed 	 	to	the	hubble	space	 tele 	 scope 	 	,	it	will	see	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
every	one	of	these	little	 blob 	 s 	 	is	a	 galax 	 y 	 	 rough 	 ly 	 	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	our	 milk 	 y 	 	way	--	a	hundred	billion	 star 	 s 	 	in	each	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 blob 	 s 	 	.
there	are	 approximate 	 ly 	 	a	hundred	billion	 galax 	 ies 	 	in	the	 observ 	 able 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
100	billion	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	number	you	need	to	know	.
the	age	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	between	now	and	the	big	bang	,	is	a	hundred	billion	in	dog	 year 	 s 	 	.
which	 tell 	 s 	 	you	 some 	 thing 	 	about	our	place	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
one	thing	you	can	do	with	a	picture	like	 th 	 is 	 	is	 simpl 	 y 	 	admire	it	.
it	's	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
i	've	often	 wonder 	 ed 	 	,	what	is	the	 evolution 	 ary 	 	pressure	that	made	our	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	in	the	veldt	adapt	and	evolve	to	 re 	 ally 	 	enjoy	 picture 	 s 	 	of	 galax 	 ies 	 	when	they	did	n't	have	any	.
but	we	would	 al 	 so 	 	like	to	understand	it	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	 cosmo 	 logist 	 	,	i	want	to	ask	,	why	is	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	?
one	big	clue	we	have	is	that	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	changing	with	time	.
if	you	 look 	 ed 	 	at	one	of	these	 galax 	 ies 	 	and	 measur 	 ed 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 velo 	 city 	 	,	it	would	be	moving	away	from	you	.
and	if	you	look	at	a	 galax 	 y 	 	even	 far 	 ther 	 	away	,	it	would	be	moving	away	 fast 	 er 	 	.
so	we	say	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	 expand 	 ing 	 	.
what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	,	of	course	,	is	that	,	in	the	past	,	 thing 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 close 	 r 	 	together	.
in	the	past	,	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	was	more	dense	,	and	it	was	 al 	 so 	 	 hot 	 ter 	 	.
if	you	 squeez 	 e 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	together	,	the	temperature	 go 	 es 	 	up	.
that	kind	of	 make 	 s 	 	sense	to	us	.
the	thing	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	sense	to	us	 a 	 s 	 	much	is	that	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	at	early	 time 	 s 	 	,	near	the	big	bang	,	was	 al 	 so 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	smooth	.
you	might	think	that	that	's	not	a	surprise	.
the	air	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	is	 ver 	 y 	 	smooth	.
you	might	say	,	``	well	,	 may 	 be 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	just	 smooth 	 ed 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	out	.	``
but	the	 condition 	 s 	 	near	the	big	bang	are	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	different	than	the	 condition 	 s 	 	of	the	air	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	.
in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	a	lot	 den 	 s 	 er 	 	.
the	 gravit 	 ation 	 al 	 	pull	of	 thing 	 s 	 	was	a	lot	 strong 	 er 	 	near	the	big	bang	.
what	you	have	to	think	about	is	we	have	a	 uni 	 verse 	 	with	a	hundred	billion	 galax 	 ies 	 	,	a	hundred	billion	 star 	 s 	 	each	.
at	early	 time 	 s 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	hundred	billion	 galax 	 ies 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 squeez 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	region	about	 th 	 is 	 	big	--	 liter 	 ally 	 	--	at	early	 time 	 s 	 	.
and	you	have	to	imagine	 do 	 ing 	 	that	 squeez 	 ing 	 	 with 	 out 	 	any	 im 	 perfect 	 ions 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	any	little	 spot 	 s 	 	where	there	 we 	 re 	 	a	few	more	 atom 	 s 	 	than	 some 	 where 	 	else	.
 be 	 cause 	 	if	there	had	 be 	 en 	 	,	they	would	have	 collapse 	 d 	 	under	the	 gravit 	 ation 	 al 	 	pull	 in 	 to 	 	a	huge	black	hole	.
 keep 	 ing 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	smooth	at	early	 time 	 s 	 	is	not	easy	;	it	's	a	 delic 	 ate 	 	 arrange 	 ment 	 	.
it	's	a	clue	that	the	early	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	not	 chose 	 n 	 	 random 	 ly 	 	.
there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	made	it	that	way	.
we	would	like	to	know	what	.
so	part	of	our	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	was	 give 	 n 	 	to	us	by	ludwig	boltzmann	,	an	austrian	physicist	in	the	19th	century	.
and	boltzmann	's	 con 	 trib 	 ution 	 	was	that	he	 help 	 ed 	 	us	understand	 ent 	 ropy 	 	.
you	've	heard	of	 ent 	 ropy 	 	.
it	's	the	 random 	 ness 	 	,	the	 dis 	 order 	 	,	the	 chaotic 	 ness 	 	of	some	 system 	 s 	 	.
boltzmann	 g 	 ave 	 	us	a	formula	--	 engrav 	 ed 	 	on	his	 tomb 	 stone 	 	now	--	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 quant 	 ifies 	 	what	 ent 	 ropy 	 	is	.
and	it	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	just	 say 	 ing 	 	that	 ent 	 ropy 	 	is	the	number	of	ways	we	can	 re 	 arrange 	 	the	 constit 	 uent 	 s 	 	of	a	system	so	that	you	do	n't	notice	,	so	that	 macro 	 scopic 	 ally 	 	it	 look 	 s 	 	the	same	.
if	you	have	the	air	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	you	do	n't	notice	each	individual	atom	.
a	low	 ent 	 ropy 	 	 configu 	 ration 	 	is	one	in	which	there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	a	few	 arrange 	 ments 	 	that	look	that	way	.
a	high	 ent 	 ropy 	 	 arrange 	 ment 	 	is	one	that	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 arrange 	 ments 	 	that	look	that	way	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 cruci 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 in 	 sight 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 help 	 s 	 	us	explain	the	second	law	of	 thermo 	 dynamic 	 s 	 	--	the	law	that	 say 	 s 	 	that	 ent 	 ropy 	 	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	or	in	some	 isolate 	 d 	 	bit	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
the	reason	why	 ent 	 ropy 	 	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	is	 simpl 	 y 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	more	ways	to	be	high	 ent 	 ropy 	 	than	to	be	low	 ent 	 ropy 	 	.
that	's	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 in 	 sight 	 	,	but	it	 leav 	 es 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	out	.
 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 sight 	 	that	 ent 	 ropy 	 	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	,	by	the	way	,	is	what	's	 be 	 hind 	 	what	we	call	the	arrow	of	time	,	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	the	past	and	the	future	.
every	 differ 	 ence 	 	that	there	is	between	the	past	and	the	future	is	 be 	 cause 	 	 ent 	 ropy 	 	is	increasing	--	the	fact	that	you	can	remember	the	past	,	but	not	the	future	.
the	fact	that	you	are	born	,	and	then	you	live	,	and	then	you	die	,	 al 	 ways 	 	in	that	order	,	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	 ent 	 ropy 	 	is	increasing	.
boltzmann	 explain 	 ed 	 	that	if	you	start	with	low	 ent 	 ropy 	 	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	natural	for	it	to	 in 	 crease 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	more	ways	to	be	high	 ent 	 ropy 	 	.
what	he	did	n't	explain	was	why	the	 ent 	 ropy 	 	was	ever	low	in	the	first	place	.
the	fact	that	the	 ent 	 ropy 	 	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	was	low	was	a	 reflect 	 ion 	 	of	the	fact	that	the	early	 uni 	 verse 	 	was	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	smooth	.
we	'd	like	to	understand	that	.
that	's	our	job	 a 	 s 	 	 cosmo 	 logists 	 	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	not	a	problem	that	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	giving	 en 	 ough 	 	attention	to	.
it	's	not	one	of	the	first	 thing 	 s 	 	people	would	say	,	if	you	 ask 	 ed 	 	a	modern	 cosmo 	 logist 	 	,	``	what	are	the	 problem 	 s 	 	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	address	?	``
one	of	the	people	who	did	understand	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	problem	was	richard	feynman	.
50	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	he	 g 	 ave 	 	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	a	bunch	of	different	 lectur 	 es 	 	.
he	 g 	 ave 	 	the	popular	 lectur 	 es 	 	that	 be 	 came 	 	``	the	character	of	physical	law	.	``	he	 g 	 ave 	 	 lectur 	 es 	 	to	caltech	 under 	 grad 	 s 	 	that	 be 	 came 	 	``	the	feynman	 lectur 	 es 	 	on	physics	.	``	he	 g 	 ave 	 	 lectur 	 es 	 	to	caltech	graduate	 student 	 s 	 	that	 be 	 came 	 	``	the	feynman	 lectur 	 es 	 	on	 gravit 	 ation 	 	.	``	in	every	one	of	these	 book 	 s 	 	,	every	one	of	these	 set 	 s 	 	of	 lectur 	 es 	 	,	he	 emphas 	 ized 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 puzzl 	 e 	 	:	why	did	the	early	 uni 	 verse 	 	have	 s 	 uch 	 	a	small	 ent 	 ropy 	 	?
so	he	 say 	 s 	 	--	i	'm	not	going	to	do	the	accent	--	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	for	some	reason	,	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	at	one	time	,	had	a	 ver 	 y 	 	low	 ent 	 ropy 	 	for	 it 	 s 	 	energy	content	,	and	since	then	the	 ent 	 ropy 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	.
the	arrow	of	time	can	not	be	 complete 	 ly 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	 un 	 til 	 	the	 myster 	 y 	 	of	the	 begin 	 ning 	 s 	 	of	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	are	 reduc 	 ed 	 	still	further	from	 specul 	 ation 	 	to	 understand 	 ing 	 	.	``
so	that	's	our	job	.
we	want	to	know	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	50	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	``	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	,	``	you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	we	've	 figur 	 ed 	 	it	out	by	now	.	``
it	's	not	true	that	we	've	 figur 	 ed 	 	it	out	by	now	.
the	reason	the	problem	 ha 	 s 	 	gotten	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	better	,	is	 be 	 cause 	 	in	1998	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 cruci 	 al 	 	about	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	that	we	did	n't	know	before	.
we	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	it	's	 accele 	 rating 	 	.
the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 expand 	 ing 	 	.
if	you	look	at	the	 galax 	 y 	 	,	it	's	moving	away	.
if	you	come	back	a	billion	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	and	look	at	it	 aga 	 in 	 	,	it	will	be	moving	away	 fast 	 er 	 	.
individual	 galax 	 ies 	 	are	 speed 	 ing 	 	away	from	us	 fast 	 er 	 	and	 fast 	 er 	 
so	we	say	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	 accele 	 rating 	 	.
 un 	 like 	 	the	low	 ent 	 ropy 	 	of	the	early	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	we	do	n't	know	the	answer	for	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	at	 l 	 east 	 	have	a	good	 theor 	 y 	 	that	can	explain	it	,	if	that	 theor 	 y 	 	is	right	,	and	that	's	the	 theor 	 y 	 	of	dark	energy	.
it	's	just	the	idea	that	empty	space	 it 	 self 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	energy	.
in	every	little	cubic	centimeter	of	space	,	 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	there	's	stuff	,	 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	there	's	 particle 	 s 	 	,	matter	,	 radi 	 ation 	 	or	 what 	 ever 	 	,	there	's	still	energy	,	even	in	the	space	 it 	 self 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	energy	,	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	einstein	,	 exert 	 s 	 	a	push	on	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
it	is	a	 perpetu 	 al 	 	impulse	that	 push 	 es 	 	 galax 	 ies 	 	 a 	 part 	 	from	each	other	.
 be 	 cause 	 	dark	energy	,	 un 	 like 	 	matter	or	 radi 	 ation 	 	,	 do 	 es 	 	not	 di 	 lute 	 	away	 a 	 s 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 expand 	 s 	 	.
the	amount	of	energy	in	each	cubic	centimeter	 remain 	 s 	 	the	same	,	even	 a 	 s 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 get 	 s 	 	 big 	 ger 	 	and	 big 	 ger 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 cruci 	 al 	 	 implic 	 ations 	 	for	what	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	going	to	do	in	the	future	.
for	one	thing	,	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	will	expand	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
back	when	i	was	your	age	,	we	did	n't	know	what	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	was	going	to	do	.
some	people	thought	that	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	would	 re 	 collapse 	 	in	the	future	.
einstein	was	fond	of	 th 	 is 	 	idea	.
but	if	there	's	dark	energy	,	and	the	dark	energy	 do 	 es 	 	not	go	away	,	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	just	going	to	keep	 expand 	 ing 	 	 fore 	 ver 	 	and	ever	and	ever	.
14	billion	 year 	 s 	 	in	the	past	,	100	billion	dog	 year 	 s 	 	,	but	an	infinite	number	of	 year 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	future	.
 mean 	 while 	 	,	for	all	 intent 	 s 	 	and	 purpose 	 s 	 	,	space	 look 	 s 	 	 fin 	 ite 	 	to	us	.
space	may	be	 fin 	 ite 	 	or	infinite	,	but	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	 accele 	 rating 	 	,	there	are	 part 	 s 	 	of	it	we	can	not	see	and	never	will	see	.
there	's	a	 fin 	 ite 	 	region	of	space	that	we	have	access	to	,	 surround 	 ed 	 	by	a	horizon	.
so	even	 th 	 ough 	 	time	 go 	 es 	 	on	 fore 	 ver 	 	,	space	is	 limit 	 ed 	 	to	us	.
 final 	 ly 	 	,	empty	space	 ha 	 s 	 	a	temperature	.
in	the	1970s	,	stephen	 hawk 	 ing 	 	told	us	that	a	black	hole	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	you	think	it	's	black	,	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 emit 	 s 	 	 radi 	 ation 	 	when	you	take	 in 	 to 	 	account	 quant 	 um 	 	 mechanic 	 s 	 	.
the	 curv 	 ature 	 	of	space	-	time	around	the	black	hole	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	to	life	the	 quant 	 um 	 	 mechanic 	 al 	 	 fluctu 	 ation 	 	,	and	the	black	hole	 radiate 	 s 	 	.
a	 precise 	 ly 	 	similar	 calcul 	 ation 	 	by	 hawk 	 ing 	 	and	gary	 gib 	 bon 	 s 	 	 show 	 ed 	 	that	if	you	have	dark	energy	in	empty	space	,	then	the	whole	 uni 	 verse 	 	 radiate 	 s 	 	.
the	energy	of	empty	space	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	to	life	 quant 	 um 	 	 fluctu 	 ations 	 	.
and	so	even	 th 	 ough 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	will	last	 fore 	 ver 	 	,	and	 ordin 	 ary 	 	matter	and	 radi 	 ation 	 	will	 di 	 lute 	 	away	,	there	will	 al 	 ways 	 	be	some	 radi 	 ation 	 	,	some	thermal	 fluctu 	 ations 	 	,	even	in	empty	space	.
so	what	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	is	that	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	like	a	box	of	gas	that	 last 	 s 	 	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
well	what	is	the	 implic 	 ation 	 	of	that	?
that	 implic 	 ation 	 	was	 stud 	 ied 	 	by	boltzmann	back	in	the	19th	century	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	well	,	 ent 	 ropy 	 	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	more	ways	for	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	to	be	high	 ent 	 ropy 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	low	 ent 	 ropy 	 	.
but	that	's	a	 pro 	 bab 	 il 	 istic 	 	 state 	 ment 	 	.
it	will	 prob 	 ably 	 	 in 	 crease 	 	,	and	the	 prob 	 ability 	 	is	 enormous 	 ly 	 	huge	.
it	's	not	 some 	 thing 	 	you	have	to	worry	about	--	the	air	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	all	 gather 	 ing 	 	over	one	part	of	the	room	and	 suffoc 	 ating 	 	us	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 like 	 ly 	 	.
 ex 	 cept 	 	if	they	 lock 	 ed 	 	the	 door 	 s 	 	and	 ke 	 pt 	 	us	here	 liter 	 ally 	 	 fore 	 ver 	 	,	that	would	happen	.
 every 	 thing 	 	that	is	 allow 	 ed 	 	,	every	 configu 	 ration 	 	that	is	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	be	 obtain 	 ed 	 	by	the	 molecule 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	would	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	be	 obtain 	 ed 	 	.
so	boltzmann	 say 	 s 	 	,	look	,	you	could	start	with	a	 uni 	 verse 	 	that	was	in	thermal	equilibrium	.
he	did	n't	know	about	the	big	bang	.	he	did	n't	know	about	the	expansion	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
he	thought	that	space	and	time	 we 	 re 	 	 explain 	 ed 	 	by	isaac	newton	--	they	 we 	 re 	 	absolute	;	they	just	 s 	 tuck 	 	there	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
so	his	idea	of	a	natural	 uni 	 verse 	 	was	one	in	which	the	air	 molecule 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	just	spread	out	 even 	 ly 	 	 every 	 where 	 	--	the	 every 	 thing 	 	 molecule 	 s 	 	.
but	if	you	're	boltzmann	,	you	know	that	if	you	wait	long	 en 	 ough 	 	,	the	random	 fluctu 	 ations 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 molecule 	 s 	 	will	 occasion 	 ally 	 	 br 	 ing 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	lower	 ent 	 ropy 	 	 configu 	 ration 	 s 	 	.
and	then	,	of	course	,	in	the	natural	course	of	 thing 	 s 	 	,	they	will	expand	back	.
so	it	's	not	that	 ent 	 ropy 	 	must	 al 	 ways 	 	 in 	 crease 	 	--	you	can	get	 fluctu 	 ations 	 	 in 	 to 	 	lower	 ent 	 ropy 	 	,	more	 organize 	 d 	 	 situ 	 ations 	 	.
well	if	that	's	true	,	boltzmann	then	 go 	 es 	 	onto	invent	two	 ver 	 y 	 	modern	-	 sound 	 ing 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	--	the	 multi 	 verse 	 	and	the	 anthro 	 pic 	 	principle	.
he	 say 	 s 	 	,	the	problem	with	thermal	equilibrium	is	that	we	ca	n't	live	there	.
remember	,	life	 it 	 self 	 	 depend 	 s 	 	on	the	arrow	of	time	.
we	would	not	be	able	to	process	information	,	 metabol 	 ize 	 	,	walk	and	talk	,	if	we	lived	in	thermal	equilibrium	.
so	if	you	imagine	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	big	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	an	 infinite 	 ly 	 	big	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	with	 random 	 ly 	 	 bump 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	each	other	 particle 	 s 	 	,	there	will	 occasion 	 ally 	 	be	small	 fluctu 	 ations 	 	in	the	lower	 ent 	 ropy 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	and	then	they	relax	back	.
but	there	will	 al 	 so 	 	be	large	 fluctu 	 ations 	 	.
 occasion 	 ally 	 	,	you	will	make	a	planet	or	a	star	or	a	 galax 	 y 	 	or	a	hundred	billion	 galax 	 ies 	 	.
so	boltzmann	 say 	 s 	 	,	we	will	 on 	 ly 	 	live	in	the	part	of	the	 multi 	 verse 	 	,	in	the	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	 infinite 	 ly 	 	big	set	of	 fluctu 	 ating 	 	 particle 	 s 	 	,	where	life	is	possible	.
that	's	the	region	where	 ent 	 ropy 	 	is	low	.
 may 	 be 	 	our	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	just	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 happen 	 s 	 	from	time	to	time	.
now	your	 home 	 work 	 	 assign 	 ment 	 	is	to	 re 	 ally 	 	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	to	 contempl 	 ate 	 	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	.
carl	sagan	once	 famous 	 ly 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	that	``	in	order	to	make	an	apple	pie	,	you	must	first	invent	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.	``	but	he	was	not	right	.
in	boltzmann	's	scenario	,	if	you	want	to	make	an	apple	pie	,	you	just	wait	for	the	random	motion	of	 atom 	 s 	 	to	make	you	an	apple	pie	.
that	will	happen	much	more	 frequent 	 ly 	 	than	the	random	 motion 	 s 	 	of	 atom 	 s 	 	making	you	an	apple	 orc 	 hard 	 	and	some	sugar	and	an	oven	,	and	then	making	you	an	apple	pie	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	scenario	 make 	 s 	 	 predict 	 ions 	 	.
and	the	 predict 	 ions 	 	are	that	the	 fluctu 	 ations 	 	that	make	us	are	minimal	.
even	if	you	imagine	that	 th 	 is 	 	room	we	are	in	now	 exist 	 s 	 	and	is	real	and	here	we	are	,	and	we	have	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	our	 memor 	 ies 	 	,	but	our	impression	that	 out 	 side 	 	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	caltech	and	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	and	the	 milk 	 y 	 	way	 galax 	 y 	 	,	it	's	much	 eas 	 ier 	 	for	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 impression 	 s 	 	to	 random 	 ly 	 	 fluctu 	 ate 	 	 in 	 to 	 	your	brain	than	for	them	 actual 	 ly 	 	to	 random 	 ly 	 	 fluctu 	 ate 	 	 in 	 to 	 	caltech	,	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	and	the	 galax 	 y 	 	.
the	good	news	is	that	,	 there 	 fore 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	scenario	 do 	 es 	 	not	work	;	it	is	not	right	.
 th 	 is 	 	scenario	 predict 	 s 	 	that	we	should	be	a	minimal	 fluctu 	 ation 	 	.
even	if	you	left	our	 galax 	 y 	 	out	,	you	would	not	get	a	hundred	billion	other	 galax 	 ies 	 	.
and	feynman	 al 	 so 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
feynman	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	from	the	 hypo 	 thesis 	 	that	the	world	is	a	 fluctu 	 ation 	 	,	all	the	 predict 	 ions 	 	are	that	if	we	look	at	a	part	of	the	world	we	've	never	 s 	 een 	 	before	,	we	will	find	it	 mix 	 ed 	 	up	,	and	not	like	the	piece	we	've	just	 look 	 ed 	 	at	--	high	 ent 	 ropy 	 	.
if	our	order	 we 	 re 	 	due	to	a	 fluctu 	 ation 	 	,	we	would	not	expect	order	 any 	 where 	 	but	where	we	have	just	 notice 	 d 	 	it	.
we	 there 	 fore 	 	conclude	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	not	a	 fluctu 	 ation 	 	.	``
so	that	's	good	.	the	question	is	then	what	is	the	right	answer	?
if	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	not	a	 fluctu 	 ation 	 	,	why	did	the	early	 uni 	 verse 	 	have	a	low	 ent 	 ropy 	 	?
and	i	would	love	to	tell	you	the	answer	,	but	i	'm	running	out	of	time	.
here	is	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	that	we	tell	you	about	,	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 exist 	 s 	 	.
i	just	 show 	 ed 	 	you	 th 	 is 	 	picture	.
the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	 expand 	 ing 	 	for	the	last	10	billion	 year 	 s 	 	or	so	.
it	's	 cool 	 ing 	 	off	.
but	we	now	know	 en 	 ough 	 	about	the	future	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	to	say	a	lot	more	.
if	the	dark	energy	 remain 	 s 	 	around	,	the	 star 	 s 	 	around	us	will	use	up	 the 	 ir 	 	nuclear	fuel	,	they	will	stop	 burn 	 ing 	 	.
they	will	fall	 in 	 to 	 	black	 hole 	 s 	 	.
we	will	live	in	a	 uni 	 verse 	 	with	 noth 	 ing 	 	in	it	but	black	 hole 	 s 	 	.
that	 uni 	 verse 	 	will	last	10	to	the	100	 year 	 s 	 	--	a	lot	 long 	 er 	 	than	our	little	 uni 	 verse 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	lived	.
the	future	is	much	 long 	 er 	 	than	the	past	.
but	even	black	 hole 	 s 	 	do	n't	last	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
they	will	 evapo 	 rate 	 	,	and	we	will	be	left	with	 noth 	 ing 	 	but	empty	space	.
that	empty	space	 last 	 s 	 	 essential 	 ly 	 	 fore 	 ver 	 	.	 how 	 ever 	 	,	you	notice	,	since	empty	space	 give 	 s 	 	off	 radi 	 ation 	 	,	there	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	thermal	 fluctu 	 ations 	 	,	and	it	 cycle 	 s 	 	around	all	the	different	possible	 combination 	 s 	 	of	the	 degree 	 s 	 	of	 free 	 dom 	 	that	exist	in	empty	space	.
so	even	 th 	 ough 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 last 	 s 	 	 fore 	 ver 	 	,	there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	a	 fin 	 ite 	 	number	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	can	possibly	happen	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
they	all	happen	over	a	period	of	time	equal	to	10	to	the	10	to	the	120	 year 	 s 	 	.	so	here	's	two	 question 	 s 	 	for	you	.
number	one	:	if	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 last 	 s 	 	for	10	to	the	10	to	the	120	 year 	 s 	 	,
why	are	we	born	in	the	first	14	billion	 year 	 s 	 	of	it	,	in	the	warm	,	 comfort 	 able 	 	 after 	 glow 	 	of	the	big	bang	?
why	are	n't	we	in	empty	space	?
you	might	say	,	``	well	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	there	to	be	living	,	``
but	that	's	not	right	.
you	could	be	a	random	 fluctu 	 ation 	 	out	of	the	 noth 	 ing 	 ness 	 	.
why	are	n't	you	?
more	 home 	 work 	 	 assign 	 ment 	 	for	you	.
so	like	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	i	do	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	know	the	answer	.
i	'm	going	to	give	you	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	scenario	.
either	it	's	just	like	that	.	there	is	no	 explan 	 ation 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	brute	fact	about	the	 uni 	 verse 	 
that	you	should	learn	to	accept	and	stop	 ask 	 ing 	 	 question 	 s 	 	.
or	 may 	 be 	 	the	big	bang	is	not	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
an	egg	,	an	 un 	 broken 	 	egg	,	is	a	low	 ent 	 ropy 	 	 configu 	 ration 	 	,	and	yet	,	when	we	open	our	 refrige 	 rator 	 	,	we	do	not	go	,	``	hah	,	how	surprising	to	find	 th 	 is 	 	low	 ent 	 ropy 	 	 configu 	 ration 	 	in	our	 refrige 	 rator 	 	.	``
that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	an	egg	is	not	a	closed	system	;	it	 come 	 s 	 	out	of	a	chicken	.
 may 	 be 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 come 	 s 	 	out	of	a	universal	chicken	.
 may 	 be 	 	there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 natural 	 ly 	 	,	through	the	growth	of	the	 law 	 s 	 	of	physics	,	 give 	 s 	 	rise	to	 uni 	 verse 	 	like	 our 	 s 	 	in	low	 ent 	 ropy 	 	 configu 	 ration 	 s 	 	.
if	that	's	true	,	it	would	happen	more	than	once	;	we	would	be	part	of	a	much	 big 	 ger 	 	 multi 	 verse 	 	.
that	's	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	scenario	.
so	the	 organize 	 rs 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	to	end	with	a	bold	 specul 	 ation 	 	.
my	bold	 specul 	 ation 	 	is	that	i	will	be	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 vindic 	 ated 	 	by	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
and	50	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	,	all	of	my	current	wild	 idea 	 s 	 	will	be	 accept 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 truth 	 s 	 	by	the	scientific	and	external	 commun 	 ities 	 	.
we	will	all	 believ 	 e 	 	that	our	little	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	just	a	small	part	of	a	much	 large 	 r 	 	 multi 	 verse 	 	.
and	even	better	,	we	will	understand	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	at	the	big	bang	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	a	 theor 	 y 	 	that	we	will	be	able	to	 compar 	 e 	 	to	 observ 	 ations 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 predict 	 ion 	 	.	i	might	be	wrong	.
but	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	human	race	about	what	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	was	like	,	why	it	came	to	be	in	the	way	it	did	for	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 excit 	 ing 	 	to	think	we	may	 final 	 ly 	 	know	the	answer	 some 	 day 	 	.
