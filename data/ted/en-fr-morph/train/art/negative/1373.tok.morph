i	'm	going	to	speak	about	a	 tin 	 y 	 	,	little	idea	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	about	shifting	 base 	 line 	 	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	the	idea	can	be	 explain 	 ed 	 	in	one	minute	,	i	will	tell	you	three	 st 	 ories 	 	before	to	fill	in	the	time	.
and	the	first	story	is	about	charles	darwin	,	one	of	my	heroes	.
and	he	was	here	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	well	know	,	in	'35	.
and	you	'd	think	he	was	chasing	 fin 	 ches 	 	,	but	he	was	n't	.
he	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 collect 	 ing 	 	fish	.
and	he	 de 	 scribed 	 	one	of	them	 a 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	``	common	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	was	the	_UNK_	 group 	 er 	 	.	a	big	 fish 	 ery 	 	was	run	on	it	 un 	 til 	 	the	'80s	.
now	the	fish	is	on	the	iucn	red	list	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	story	,	we	have	heard	it	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 time 	 s 	 	on	galapagos	and	other	 place 	 s 	 	,	so	there	is	 noth 	 ing 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	about	it	.
but	the	point	is	,	we	still	come	to	galapagos	.
we	still	think	it	is	 pr 	 ist 	 ine 	 	.
the	 brochure 	 s 	 	still	say	it	is	 un 	 touch 	 ed 	 	.
so	what	 happen 	 s 	 	here	?
the	second	story	,	 al 	 so 	 	to	 illustr 	 ate 	 	 an 	 other 	 	 con 	 cept 	 	,	is	 call 	 ed 	 	shifting	 waist 	 line 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	there	in	'71	,	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	a	 lag 	 oon 	 	in	west	africa	.
i	was	there	 be 	 cause 	 	i	grew	up	in	europe	and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	to	work	in	africa	.
and	i	thought	i	could	blend	in	.
and	i	got	a	big	sunburn	,	and	i	was	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	that	i	was	 re 	 ally 	 	not	from	there	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	my	first	sunburn	.
and	the	 lag 	 oon 	 	was	 surround 	 ed 	 	by	palm	 tree 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	and	a	few	 man 	 grove 	 	.
and	it	had	tilapia	about	20	 centimeter 	 s 	 	,	a	species	of	tilapia	 call 	 ed 	 	_UNK_	tilapia	.
and	the	 fish 	 eries 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	tilapia	 sustain 	 ed 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	fish	and	they	had	a	good	time	and	they	 earn 	 ed 	 	more	than	average	in	ghana	.
when	i	went	there	27	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	the	fish	had	shrunk	to	half	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 s 	 ize 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 matur 	 ing 	 	at	five	 centimeter 	 s 	 	.
they	had	 be 	 en 	 	 push 	 ed 	 	 genetic 	 ally 	 	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	still	 fish 	 es 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	still	kind	of	happy	.
and	the	fish	 al 	 so 	 	 we 	 re 	 	happy	to	be	there	.
so	 noth 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	,	but	 every 	 thing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	.
my	third	little	story	is	that	i	was	an	_UNK_	in	the	 introduc 	 tion 	 	of	 trawl 	 ing 	 	in	 south 	 east 	 	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	.	in	the	'70s	--	well	,	 begin 	 ning 	 	in	the	'60s	--	europe	did	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 develop 	 ment 	 	 project 	 s 	 	.
fish	 develop 	 ment 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	 im 	 posing 	 	on	 count 	 ries 	 	that	had	 al 	 ready 	 	100,000	 fish 	 ers 	 	to	impose	on	them	industrial	 fish 	 ing 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	boat	,	 quit 	 e 	 	 ug 	 ly 	 	,	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	_UNK_	4	.
and	i	went	 s 	 ailing 	 	on	it	,	and	we	did	 survey 	 s 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	southern	south	 chin 	 a 	 	sea	and	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	the	java	sea	.
and	what	we	caught	,	we	did	n't	have	 word 	 s 	 	for	it	.
what	we	caught	,	i	know	now	,	is	the	bottom	of	the	sea	.
and	90	percent	of	our	catch	 we 	 re 	 	 sponge 	 s 	 	,	other	 animal 	 s 	 	that	are	 fix 	 ed 	 	on	the	bottom	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	most	of	the	fish	,	they	are	a	little	spot	on	the	 deb 	 ris 	 	,	the	 pile 	 s 	 	of	 deb 	 ris 	 	,	 we 	 re 	 	coral	reef	fish	.
 essential 	 ly 	 	the	bottom	of	the	sea	came	onto	the	deck	and	then	was	 throw 	 n 	 	down	.
and	these	 picture 	 s 	 	are	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 transit 	 ion 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	rapid	.
 with 	 in 	 	a	year	,	you	do	a	survey	and	then	commercial	 fish 	 ing 	 	 begin 	 s 	 	.
the	bottom	is	 transform 	 ed 	 	from	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	a	hard	bottom	or	soft	coral	 in 	 to 	 	a	 mud 	 dy 	 	mess	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	dead	turtle	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	not	eaten	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 throw 	 n 	 	away	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	dead	.
and	one	time	we	caught	a	live	one	.
it	was	not	 drown 	 ed 	 	yet	.
and	then	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	kill	it	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	good	to	eat	.
 th 	 is 	 	mountain	of	 deb 	 ris 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 collect 	 ed 	 	by	 fish 	 ers 	 	every	time	they	go	 in 	 to 	 	an	area	that	's	never	 be 	 en 	 	 fish 	 ed 	 	.
but	it	's	not	 document 	 ed 	 	.
we	transform	the	world	,	but	we	do	n't	remember	it	.
we	adjust	our	 base 	 line 	 	to	the	new	level	,	and	we	do	n't	recall	what	was	there	.
if	you	 general 	 ize 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	.
you	have	on	the	y	axis	some	good	thing	:	 bio 	 divers 	 ity 	 	,	 number 	 s 	 	of	orca	,	the	_UNK_	of	your	country	,	the	water	supply	.
and	over	time	it	 change 	 s 	 	--
it	 change 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	people	do	 thing 	 s 	 	,	or	 natural 	 ly 	 	.
every	generation	will	use	the	 image 	 s 	 	that	they	got	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	conscious	 live 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	standard	and	will	 extrapol 	 ate 	 	forward	.
and	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	then	,	they	perceive	 a 	 s 	 	a	loss	.
but	they	do	n't	perceive	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	before	 a 	 s 	 	a	loss	.
you	can	have	a	 success 	 ion 	 	of	 change 	 s 	 	.
at	the	end	you	want	to	sustain	 mis 	 er 	 able 	 	 left 	 over 	 s 	 	.
and	that	,	to	a	large	 ex 	 tent 	 	,	is	what	we	want	to	do	now	.
we	want	to	sustain	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	gone	or	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	not	the	way	they	 we 	 re 	 	.
now	one	should	think	 th 	 is 	 	problem	 affect 	 ed 	 	people	 certain 	 ly 	 	when	in	 predator 	 y 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	,	they	 kill 	 ed 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	and	they	did	n't	know	they	had	 d 	 one 	 	so	after	a	few	 generation 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	an	animal	that	is	 ver 	 y 	 	abundant	,	before	it	 get 	 s 	 	extinct	,	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	rare	.
so	you	do	n't	lose	abundant	 animal 	 s 	 	.
you	 al 	 ways 	 	lose	rare	 animal 	 s 	 	.
and	 there 	 fore 	 	they	're	not	 perceive 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	big	loss	.
over	time	,	we	 concent 	 rate 	 	on	large	 animal 	 s 	 	,	and	in	a	sea	that	 mean 	 s 	 	the	big	fish	.
they	 be 	 come 	 	 rare 	 r 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	fish	them	.
over	time	we	have	a	few	fish	left	and	we	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 base 	 line 	 	.
and	the	question	is	,	why	do	people	accept	 th 	 is 	 	?
well	 be 	 cause 	 	they	do	n't	know	that	it	was	different	.
and	in	fact	,	 lot 	 s 	 	of	people	,	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	will	contest	that	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	different	.
and	they	will	contest	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	evidence	 present 	 ed 	 	in	an	 ear 	 lier 	 	mode	is	not	in	the	way	they	would	like	the	evidence	 present 	 ed 	 	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	the	anecdote	that	some	present	,	 a 	 s 	 	 cap 	 tain 	 	so	-	and	-	so	 observ 	 ed 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	fish	in	 th 	 is 	 	area	can	not	be	used	or	is	 usual 	 ly 	 	not	 util 	 ized 	 	by	 fish 	 ery 	 	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	not	``	scientific	.	``
so	you	have	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	where	people	do	n't	know	the	past	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	we	live	in	 liter 	 ate 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	do	n't	trust	the	 source 	 s 	 	of	the	past	.
and	 h 	 ence 	 	,	the	enormous	role	that	a	marine	 protect 	 ed 	 	area	can	play	.
 be 	 cause 	 	with	marine	 protect 	 ed 	 	 area 	 s 	 	,	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 re 	 create 	 	the	past	.
we	 re 	 create 	 	the	past	that	people	can	not	 conceiv 	 e 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 base 	 line 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 shift 	 ed 	 	and	is	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	low	.
that	is	for	people	who	can	see	a	marine	 protect 	 ed 	 	area	and	who	can	benefit	from	the	 in 	 sight 	 	that	it	 provide 	 s 	 	,	which	 en 	 able 	 s 	 	them	to	 re 	 set 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 base 	 line 	 	.
how	about	the	people	who	ca	n't	do	that	 be 	 cause 	 	they	have	no	access	--	the	people	in	the	 mid 	 west 	 	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	?
there	i	think	that	the	 art 	 s 	 	and	film	can	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	fill	the	gap	,	and	 simul 	 ation 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 simul 	 ation 	 	of	chesapeake	 ba 	 y 	 	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	gray	 whale 	 s 	 	in	chesapeake	 ba 	 y 	 	a	long	time	ago	--	500	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	you	will	have	 notice 	 d 	 	that	the	 hu 	 es 	 	and	 tone 	 s 	 	are	like	``	avatar	.	``
and	if	you	think	about	``	avatar	,	``	if	you	think	of	why	people	 we 	 re 	 	so	 touch 	 ed 	 	by	it	--	never	mind	the	_UNK_	story	--	why	so	 touch 	 ed 	 	by	the	 image 	 ry 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	it	 evoke 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	in	a	sense	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	lost	.
and	so	my	 recommend 	 ation 	 	,	it	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	one	i	will	provide	,	is	for	cameron	to	do	``	avatar	ii	``	 under 	 water 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
