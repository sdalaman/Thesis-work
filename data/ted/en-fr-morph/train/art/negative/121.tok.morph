the	 immers 	 ive 	 	 ugli 	 ness 	 	of	our	 every 	 day 	 	 environment 	 s 	 	in	america	is	 ent 	 ropy 	 	made	visible	.
we	ca	n't	 over 	 estimate 	 	the	amount	of	despair	that	we	are	generating	with	 place 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	 most 	 ly 	 	,	i	want	to	 persuad 	 e 	 	you	that	we	have	to	do	better	if	we	're	going	to	 continu 	 e 	 	the	project	of	 civil 	 ization 	 	in	america	.
by	the	way	,	 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	help	.
 no 	 body 	 	's	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	better	day	down	here	 be 	 cause 	 	of	that	.	there	are	a	lot	of	ways	you	can	 de 	 scribe 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.	you	know	,	i	like	to	call	it	``	the	national	 auto 	 mobile 	 	 s 	 lum 	 	.	``	you	can	call	it	 sub 	 urban 	 	sprawl	.
i	think	it	's	appropriate	to	call	it	the	 great 	 est 	 	misallocation	of	 resource 	 s 	 	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	the	world	.
you	can	call	it	a	technosis	 external 	 ity 	 	clusterfuck	.
and	it	's	a	tremendous	problem	for	us	.
the	 out 	 stand 	 ing 	 	--	the	 s 	 al 	 ient 	 	problem	about	 th 	 is 	 	for	us	is	that	these	are	 place 	 s 	 	that	are	not	worth	 car 	 ing 	 	about	.
we	're	going	to	talk	about	that	some	more	.
a	sense	of	place	:
your	ability	to	create	 place 	 s 	 	that	are	 meaning 	 ful 	 	and	 place 	 s 	 	of	quality	and	character	 depend 	 s 	 	 entire 	 ly 	 	on	your	ability	to	define	space	with	 building 	 s 	 	,	and	to	employ	the	 vocabul 	 aries 	 	,	grammars	,	syntaxes	,	 rhythm 	 s 	 	and	 pattern 	 s 	 	of	 architect 	 ure 	 	in	order	to	inform	us	who	we	are	.
the	public	realm	in	america	 ha 	 s 	 	two	 role 	 s 	 	:	it	is	the	dwelling	place	of	our	 civil 	 ization 	 	and	our	civic	life	,	and	it	is	the	physical	 manifest 	 ation 	 	of	the	common	good	.
and	when	you	 de 	 grade 	 	the	public	realm	,	you	will	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	 de 	 grade 	 	the	quality	of	your	civic	life	and	the	character	of	all	the	enactments	of	your	public	life	and	 commun 	 al 	 	life	that	take	place	there	.	the	public	realm	 come 	 s 	 	 most 	 ly 	 	in	the	form	of	the	street	in	america	 be 	 cause 	 	we	do	n't	have	the	1,000	-	year	-	old	 cat 	 hedral 	 	 plaza 	 s 	 	and	market	 square 	 s 	 	of	 old 	 er 	 	 culture 	 s 	 	.
and	your	ability	to	define	space	and	to	create	 place 	 s 	 	that	are	worth	 car 	 ing 	 	about	all	 come 	 s 	 	from	a	body	of	culture	that	we	call	the	culture	of	civic	design	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	body	of	knowledge	,	method	,	skill	and	principle	that	we	threw	in	the	garbage	after	world	war	ii	and	 decide 	 d 	 	we	do	n't	need	that	 any 	 more 	 	;	we	're	not	going	to	use	it	.	and	 con 	 sequent 	 ly 	 	,	we	can	see	the	result	all	around	us	.	the	public	realm	 ha 	 s 	 	to	inform	us	not	 on 	 ly 	 	where	we	are	 geo 	 graphical 	 ly 	 	,	but	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	inform	us	where	we	are	in	our	culture	.	where	we	've	come	from	,	what	kind	of	people	we	are	,	and	it	 need 	 s 	 	to	,	by	 do 	 ing 	 	that	,	it	 need 	 s 	 	to	afford	us	a	 glimps 	 e 	 	to	where	we	're	going	in	order	to	allow	us	to	 d 	 well 	 	in	a	 hope 	 ful 	 	present	.	if	there	is	one	great	 catastroph 	 e 	 	about	the	 place 	 s 	 	that	we	've	built	,	the	human	 environment 	 s 	 	we	've	made	for	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	the	last	50	 year 	 s 	 	,	it	is	that	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 depriv 	 ed 	 	us	of	the	ability	to	live	in	a	 hope 	 ful 	 	present	.	the	 environment 	 s 	 	we	are	living	in	,	more	 typical 	 ly 	 	,	are	like	these	.	you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	to	be	the	 a 	 steroid 	 	belt	of	 architect 	 ural 	 	garbage	two	 mile 	 s 	 	north	of	my	town	.
and	remember	,	to	create	a	place	of	character	and	quality	,	you	have	to	be	able	to	define	space	.
so	how	is	that	 be 	 ing 	 	 accomplish 	 ed 	 	here	?
if	you	stand	on	the	apron	of	the	wal	-	mart	over	here	and	try	to	look	at	the	target	store	over	here	,	you	ca	n't	see	it	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 curv 	 ature 	 	of	the	earth	.	that	's	nature	's	way	of	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	that	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	a	poor	job	of	 defi 	 ning 	 	space	.
 con 	 sequent 	 ly 	 	,	these	will	be	 place 	 s 	 	that	 no 	 body 	 	 want 	 s 	 	to	be	in	.	these	will	be	 place 	 s 	 	that	are	not	worth	 car 	 ing 	 	about	.	we	have	about	,	you	know	,	38,000	 place 	 s 	 	that	are	not	worth	 car 	 ing 	 	about	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
when	we	have	 en 	 ough 	 	of	them	,	we	're	going	to	have	a	nation	that	's	not	worth	 defend 	 ing 	 	.	and	i	want	you	to	think	about	that	when	you	think	about	 t 	 hose 	 	young	men	and	women	who	are	over	in	 place 	 s 	 	like	 ir 	 aq 	 	,	 s 	 pill 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	blood	in	the	sand	,
and	ask	 your 	 self 	 	,	``	what	is	 the 	 ir 	 	last	thought	of	home	?	``
i	hope	it	's	not	the	 cur 	 b 	 	cut	between	the	chuck	e.	cheese	and	the	target	store
 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	not	good	 en 	 ough 	 	for	americans	to	be	 s 	 pill 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	blood	for	.
we	need	better	 place 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	.
public	space	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	good	public	space	.
it	's	a	place	worth	 car 	 ing 	 	about	.	it	's	well	defined	.
it	is	 emphatic 	 ally 	 	an	 out 	 door 	 	public	room	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	 terr 	 ibly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	--	it	 ha 	 s 	 	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	an	active	and	 perm 	 e 	 able 	 	membrane	around	the	edge	.
that	's	a	 f 	 ancy 	 	way	of	 say 	 ing 	 	it	's	got	 shop 	 s 	 	,	 bar 	 s 	 	,	bistros	,	 destination 	 s 	 	--	 thing 	 s 	 	go	in	and	out	of	it	.	it	's	 perm 	 e 	 able 	 	.
the	beer	 go 	 es 	 	in	and	out	,	the	 wait 	 re 	 s 	 s 	 es 	 	go	in	and	out	,	and	that	 activate 	 s 	 	the	center	of	 th 	 is 	 	place	and	 make 	 s 	 	it	a	place	that	people	want	to	hang	out	in	.
you	know	,	in	these	 place 	 s 	 	in	other	 culture 	 s 	 	,	people	just	go	there	 volu 	 nt 	 arily 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	like	them	.	we	do	n't	have	to	have	a	craft	fair	here	to	get	people	to	come	here	.	you	know	,	you	do	n't	have	to	have	a	kwanzaa	 fest 	 ival 	 	.	people	just	go	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 pleas 	 ur 	 able 	 	to	be	there	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	we	do	it	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	most	significant	public	space	failure	in	america	,	designed	by	the	 lead 	 ing 	 	 architect 	 s 	 	of	the	day	,	harry	cobb	and	i.m	.	pei	:	boston	city	hall	plaza	.
a	public	place	so	 dis 	 mal 	 	that	the	winos	do	n't	even	want	to	go	there	.	and	we	ca	n't	fix	it	 be 	 cause 	 	i.m	.	pei	's	still	 al 	 ive 	 	,	and	every	year	harvard	and	m.i.t	.	have	a	joint	 commit 	 tee 	 	to	repair	it	.
and	every	year	they	fail	to	 be 	 cause 	 	they	do	n't	want	to	hurt	i.m	.	pei	's	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	other	side	of	the	building	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	the	winner	of	an	 inter 	 national 	 	design	 a 	 ward 	 	in	,	i	think	,	1966	,	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
it	was	n't	pei	and	cobb	,	 an 	 other 	 	firm	designed	 th 	 is 	 	,
but	there	's	not	 en 	 ough 	 	prozac	in	the	world	to	make	people	feel	ok	about	going	down	 th 	 is 	 	block	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	back	of	boston	city	hall	,	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	,	you	know	,	significant	civic	building	in	albany	--	excuse	me	--	in	boston	.	and	what	is	the	 mess 	 age 	 	that	is	coming	,	what	are	the	 vocabul 	 aries 	 	and	grammars	that	are	coming	,	from	 th 	 is 	 	building	and	how	is	it	 inform 	 ing 	 	us	about	who	we	are	?
 th 	 is 	 	,	in	fact	,	would	be	a	better	building	if	we	put	mosaic	 portrait 	 s 	 	of	josef	stalin	,	pol	pot	,	saddam	hussein	,	and	all	the	other	great	despots	of	the	20th	century	on	the	side	of	the	building	,	 be 	 cause 	 	then	we	'd	 honest 	 ly 	 	be	 say 	 ing 	 	what	the	building	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 commun 	 ic 	 ating 	 	to	us	.	you	know	,	that	it	's	a	 de 	 spot 	 ic 	 	building	;	it	 want 	 s 	 	us	to	feel	like	 term 	 ites 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	it	on	a	 small 	 er 	 	scale	:
the	back	of	the	civic	center	in	my	town	,	saratoga	 spring 	 s 	 	,	new	york	.
by	the	way	,	when	i	 show 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	slide	to	a	group	of	kiwanians	in	my	town	,	they	all	rose	in	indignation	from	 the 	 ir 	 	creamed	chicken	,
and	they	 shout 	 ed 	 	at	me	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	it	was	 rain 	 ing 	 	that	day	when	you	took	that	picture	!	``
 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	was	 perceive 	 d 	 	to	be	a	weather	problem	.
you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	building	designed	like	a	dvd	player	.
audio	jack	,	power	supply	--	and	look	,	you	know	these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 import 	 ant 	 	 architect 	 ural 	 	 job 	 s 	 	for	 firm 	 s 	 	,	right	?
you	know	,	we	hire	 firm 	 s 	 	to	design	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
you	can	see	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	went	on	,	three	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	at	the	design	 meet 	 ing 	 	.
you	know	,	eight	 hour 	 s 	 	before	 dead 	 line 	 	,	four	 architect 	 s 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	 th 	 is 	 	building	in	on	time	,	right	?
and	they	're	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	at	the	long	 board 	 room 	 	table	with	all	the	 draw 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 render 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	and	all	the	chinese	food	caskets	are	 ly 	 ing 	 	on	the	table	,	and	--	i	mean	,	what	was	the	conversation	that	was	going	on	there	?
 be 	 cause 	 	you	know	what	the	last	word	was	,	what	the	last	sentence	was	of	that	 meet 	 ing 	 	.
it	was	:	``	fuck	it	.	``	that	--	that	is	the	 mess 	 age 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	form	of	 architect 	 ure 	 	.
the	 mess 	 age 	 	is	:	we	do	n't	give	a	fuck	!	we	do	n't	give	a	fuck	.
so	i	went	back	on	the	 nic 	 est 	 	day	of	the	year	,	just	to	--	you	know	--	do	some	 re 	 ality 	 	 test 	 ing 	 	,
and	in	fact	,	he	will	not	even	go	down	there	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	not	 interest 	 ing 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	for	his	 client 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	the	 burglar 	 s 	 	,	the	muggers	.
it	's	not	civically	rich	 en 	 ough 	 	for	them	to	go	down	there	.
ok	.
the	pattern	of	main	street	usa	--	in	fact	,	 th 	 is 	 	pattern	of	building	 down 	 town 	 	 block 	 s 	 	,	all	over	the	world	,	is	 fair 	 ly 	 	universal	.
it	's	not	that	 complic 	 ated 	 	:	 building 	 s 	 	more	than	one	story	high	,	built	out	to	the	 side 	 walk 	 	edge	,	so	that	people	who	are	,	you	know	,	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	people	can	get	 in 	 to 	 	the	building	.
other	 activ 	 ities 	 	are	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	occur	 up 	 stair 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	 a 	 part 	 ments 	 	,	 off 	 ice 	 s 	 	,	and	so	on	.
you	make	 pro 	 vision 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	activity	 call 	 ed 	 	 shop 	 ping 	 	on	the	ground	floor	.
they	have	n't	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	in	monterey	.
if	you	go	out	to	the	corner	right	at	the	main	 intersect 	 ion 	 	right	in	front	of	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	center	,	you	'll	see	an	 intersect 	 ion 	 	with	four	blank	 wall 	 s 	 	on	every	corner	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	you	compose	and	assemble	a	 down 	 town 	 	business	building	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	when	in	glens	 fall 	 s 	 	,	new	york	,	when	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	do	it	 aga 	 in 	 	,	where	it	was	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	,	right	?
so	the	first	thing	they	do	is	they	pop	up	the	 re 	 tail 	 	a	half	a	story	above	grade	to	make	it	sporty	.
ok	.	that	 complete 	 ly 	 	 destroy 	 s 	 	the	relationship	between	the	business	and	the	 side 	 walk 	 	,
where	the	 theoretic 	 al 	 	 pedestrian 	 s 	 	are	.
of	course	,	they	'll	never	be	there	,	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	in	that	condition	.
then	 be 	 cause 	 	the	relationship	between	the	 re 	 tail 	 	is	 destroy 	 ed 	 	,	we	pop	a	 handicap 	 ped 	 	ramp	on	that	,	and	then	to	make	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	feel	better	,	we	put	a	nature	band	-	aid	in	front	of	it	.
and	that	's	how	we	do	it	.
i	call	them	``	nature	band	-	 aid 	 s 	 	``	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	a	general	idea	in	america	that	the	 re 	 med 	 y 	 	for	 mutilate 	 d 	 	 urban 	 ism 	 	is	nature	.
and	in	fact	,	the	 re 	 med 	 y 	 	for	 wound 	 ed 	 	and	 mutilate 	 d 	 	 urban 	 ism 	 	is	good	 urban 	 ism 	 	,	good	 building 	 s 	 	.
not	just	flower	 bed 	 s 	 	,	not	just	 cartoon 	 s 	 	of	the	sierra	nevada	 mountain 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	that	's	not	good	 en 	 ough 	 	.
we	have	to	do	good	 building 	 s 	 	.
the	street	 tree 	 s 	 	have	 re 	 ally 	 	four	 job 	 s 	 	to	do	and	that	's	it	:
to	spatially	 de 	 note 	 	the	pedestrian	realm	,	to	protect	the	 pedestrian 	 s 	 	from	the	 vehicle 	 s 	 	in	the	carriageway	,	to	filter	the	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	onto	the	 side 	 walk 	 	,	and	to	 s 	 often 	 	the	hardscape	of	the	 building 	 s 	 	and	to	create	a	 ceil 	 ing 	 	--	a	vaulted	 ceil 	 ing 	 	--	over	the	street	,	at	 it 	 s 	 	best	.	and	that	's	it	.	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	four	 job 	 s 	 	of	the	street	 tree 	 s 	 	.
they	're	not	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	a	cartoon	of	the	north	 wood 	 s 	 	;
they	're	not	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	a	set	for	``	the	last	of	the	mohicans	.	``
you	know	,	one	of	the	 problem 	 s 	 	with	the	fiasco	of	suburbia	is	that	it	 destroy 	 ed 	 	our	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	the	 distinct 	 ion 	 	between	the	country	and	the	town	,	between	the	urban	and	the	 r 	 ural 	 	.
they	're	not	the	same	thing	.
and	we	're	not	going	to	cure	the	 problem 	 s 	 	of	the	urban	by	 drag 	 ging 	 	the	country	 in 	 to 	 	the	city	,	which	is	what	a	lot	of	us	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	all	the	time	.
here	you	see	it	on	a	small	scale	--	the	mothership	 ha 	 s 	 	 land 	 ed 	 	,	r	2	-	d	2	and	c	-	3po	have	 steppe 	 d 	 	out	to	test	the	bark	mulch	to	see	if	they	can	inhabit	 th 	 is 	 	planet	.	a	lot	of	 th 	 is 	 	 come 	 s 	 	from	the	fact	that	the	industrial	city	in	america	was	 s 	 uch 	 	a	trauma	that	we	 develop 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	tremendous	 a 	 version 	 	for	the	whole	idea	of	the	city	,	city	life	,	and	 every 	 thing 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	with	it	.
and	so	what	you	see	 fair 	 ly 	 	early	,	in	the	mid	-	19th	century	,	is	 th 	 is 	 	idea	that	we	now	have	to	have	an	antidote	to	the	industrial	city	,	which	is	going	to	be	life	in	the	country	for	 every 	 body 	 	.
and	that	 start 	 s 	 	to	be	 deliver 	 ed 	 	in	the	form	of	the	 rail 	 road 	 	suburb	:	the	country	villa	 a 	 long 	 	the	 rail 	 road 	 	line	,	which	 allow 	 s 	 	people	to	enjoy	the	amenity	of	the	city	,	but	to	return	to	the	 country 	 side 	 	every	night	.
and	 believ 	 e 	 	me	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	no	wal	-	marts	or	convenience	 store 	 s 	 	out	there	then	,
so	it	 re 	 ally 	 	was	a	form	of	country	living	.
but	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	,	of	course	,	it	 mut 	 ates 	 	over	the	next	80	 year 	 s 	 	and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	 insid 	 ious 	 	.	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	cartoon	of	a	country	house	,	in	a	cartoon	of	the	country	.
and	that	's	the	great	non	-	 articulate 	 d 	 	 agon 	 y 	 	of	suburbia	and	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	that	it	 lend 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	to	 ridicul 	 e 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 deliver 	 ed 	 	what	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	promising	for	half	a	century	now	.
and	these	are	 typical 	 ly 	 	the	kind	of	 dwelling 	 s 	 	we	find	there	,	you	know	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	,	a	house	with	 noth 	 ing 	 	on	the	side	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	house	 want 	 s 	 	to	state	,	 emphatic 	 ally 	 	,	``	i	'm	a	little	 cab 	 in 	 	in	the	 wood 	 s 	 	.	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	on	either	side	of	me	.
i	do	n't	have	any	 eye 	 s 	 	on	the	side	of	my	head	.	i	ca	n't	see	.	``
so	you	have	 th 	 is 	 	one	last	facade	of	the	house	,	the	front	,	which	is	 re 	 ally 	 	a	cartoon	of	a	facade	of	a	house	.
 be 	 cause 	 	--	notice	the	porch	here	.
 un 	 less 	 	the	people	that	live	here	are	munchkins	,	 no 	 body 	 	's	going	to	be	using	that	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	,	in	fact	,	a	 tele 	 vision 	 	 broad 	 cast 	 ing 	 	a	show	24/7	 call 	 ed 	 	``	we	're	normal	.	``
we	're	normal	,	we	're	normal	,	we	're	normal	,	we	're	normal	,	we	're	normal	.
 pleas 	 e 	 	respect	us	,	we	're	normal	,	we	're	normal	,	we	're	normal	.
but	we	know	what	's	going	on	in	these	 house 	 s 	 	,	you	know	.
we	know	that	little	skippy	is	 load 	 ing 	 	his	uzi	down	here	,	 get 	 ting 	 	ready	for	 home 	 room 	 	.
we	know	that	heather	,	his	sister	heather	,	14	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	is	 turn 	 ing 	 	 trick 	 s 	 	up	here	to	support	her	drug	habit	.
 be 	 cause 	 	these	 place 	 s 	 	,	these	 habit 	 at 	 s 	 	,	are	 in 	 duc 	 ing 	 	immense	 amount 	 s 	 	of	 anxie 	 ty 	 	and	 depress 	 ion 	 	in	children	,	and	they	do	n't	have	a	lot	of	experience	with	 medic 	 ation 	 	.	so	they	take	the	first	one	that	 come 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	,	often	.
these	are	not	good	 en 	 ough 	 	for	americans	.
these	are	the	 school 	 s 	 	we	are	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	them	to	:	the	hannibal	lecter	central	school	,	las	vegas	,	nevada	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	real	school	!
you	know	,	but	there	's	 obvious 	 ly 	 	a	 not 	 ion 	 	that	if	you	let	the	 in 	 mate 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	thing	out	,	that	they	would	snatch	a	motorist	off	the	street	and	eat	his	liver	.
so	every	effort	is	made	to	keep	them	 with 	 in 	 	the	building	.
notice	that	nature	is	present	.
we	're	going	to	have	to	change	 th 	 is 	 	behavior	 whet 	 her 	 	we	like	it	or	not	.
we	are	 enter 	 ing 	 	an	epochal	period	of	change	in	the	world	,	and	--	 certain 	 ly 	 	in	america
--	the	period	that	will	be	 character 	 ized 	 	by	the	end	of	the	cheap	oil	era	.
it	is	going	to	change	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	.
chris	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	not	to	go	on	too	long	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	i	wo	n't	,
 ex 	 cept 	 	to	say	there	's	not	going	to	be	a	hydrogen	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
forget	it	.	it	's	not	going	to	happen	.
we	're	going	to	have	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	else	 in 	 stead 	 	.
we	're	going	to	have	to	down	-	scale	,	re	-	scale	,	and	re	-	 s 	 ize 	 	 virtual 	 ly 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	we	do	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	and	we	ca	n't	start	soon	 en 	 ough 	 	to	do	it	.
we	're	going	to	have	--	--	we	're	going	to	have	to	live	 close 	 r 	 	to	where	we	work	.
we	're	going	to	have	to	live	 close 	 r 	 	to	each	other	.
we	're	going	have	to	grow	more	food	 close 	 r 	 	to	where	we	live	.
the	age	of	the	3,000	mile	caesar	 s 	 al 	 ad 	 	is	coming	to	an	end	.
we	're	going	to	have	to	--	we	have	a	 rail 	 road 	 	system	that	the	bulgarians	would	be	 a 	 shame 	 d 	 	of	!
we	got	ta	do	better	than	that	!
and	we	should	have	 start 	 ed 	 	two	 day 	 s 	 	before	 yester 	 day 	 	.
we	are	fortunate	that	the	new	urbanists	 we 	 re 	 	there	,	for	the	last	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	 excav 	 ating 	 	all	that	information	that	was	 throw 	 n 	 	in	the	garbage	by	our	 parent 	 s 	 	'	generation	after	world	war	ii	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	going	to	need	it	if	we	're	going	to	learn	how	to	 re 	 construct 	 	 town 	 s 	 	.
we	're	going	to	need	to	get	back	 th 	 is 	 	body	of	 method 	 ology 	 	and	principle	and	skill	in	order	to	re	-	learn	how	to	compose	 meaning 	 ful 	 	 place 	 s 	 	,	 place 	 s 	 	that	are	 integ 	 ral 	 	,
that	allow	--	that	are	living	 organism 	 s 	 	in	the	sense	that	they	contain	all	the	 organ 	 s 	 	of	our	civic	life	and	our	 commun 	 al 	 	life	,	 deploy 	 ed 	 	in	an	 integ 	 ral 	 	fashion	.
so	that	,	you	know	,	the	 residence 	 s 	 	make	sense	 deploy 	 ed 	 	in	relation	to	the	 place 	 s 	 	of	business	,	of	culture	and	of	 govern 	 ance 	 	.
we	're	going	to	have	to	re	-	learn	what	the	building	 block 	 s 	 	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	:
the	street	,	the	block	,	how	to	compose	public	space	that	's	both	large	and	small	,
the	 court 	 yard 	 	,	the	civic	square
and	how	to	 re 	 ally 	 	make	use	of	 th 	 is 	 	 proper 	 ty 	 	.
we	can	see	some	of	the	first	 idea 	 s 	 
for	retro	-	fitting	some	of	the	 catastroph 	 ic 	 	 proper 	 ty 	 	that	we	have	in	america	.
the	dead	 mall 	 s 	 	:	what	are	we	going	to	do	with	them	?
well	,	in	point	of	fact	,	most	of	them	are	not	going	to	make	it	.
they	're	not	going	to	be	retro	-	fitted	;
they	're	going	to	be	the	salvage	 yard 	 s 	 	of	the	future	.
some	of	them	we	're	going	to	fix	,	 th 	 ough 	 	.
and	we	're	going	to	fix	them	by	 im 	 posing 	 	back	on	them	street	and	block	 system 	 s 	 	and	 return 	 ing 	 	to	the	building	lot	 a 	 s 	 	the	normal	increment	of	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
and	if	we	're	 luck 	 y 	 	,	the	result	will	be	revivified	town	 center 	 s 	 	and	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	 center 	 s 	 	in	our	 exist 	 ing 	 	 town 	 s 	 	and	cities	.
and	by	the	way	,	our	 town 	 s 	 	and	cities	are	where	they	are	,	and	grew	where	they	 we 	 re 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	occupy	all	the	 import 	 ant 	 	 s 	 ites 	 	.
and	most	of	them	are	still	going	to	be	there	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	the	scale	of	them	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	going	to	be	 diminish 	 ed 	 	.
we	've	got	a	lot	of	work	to	do	.
we	're	not	going	to	be	 rescu 	 ed 	 	by	the	hyper	-	car	;	we	're	not	going	to	be	 rescu 	 ed 	 	by	 alter 	 native 	 	 fuel 	 s 	 	.
no	amount	or	combination	of	 alter 	 native 	 	 fuel 	 s 	 	is	going	to	allow	us	to	 continu 	 e 	 	running	what	we	're	running	,	the	way	we	're	running	it	.
we	're	going	to	have	to	do	 every 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	.
and	america	's	not	prepared	.
we	are	 sleep 	 walk 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	future	.
we	're	not	ready	for	what	's	coming	at	us	.
so	i	urge	you	all	to	do	what	you	can	.
life	in	the	mid	-	21st	century	is	going	to	be	about	living	 local 	 ly 	 	.
be	prepared	to	be	good	 neighbor 	 s 	 	.
be	prepared	to	find	vocations	that	make	you	 use 	 ful 	 	to	your	 neighbor 	 s 	 	and	to	your	fellow	 citizen 	 s 	 	.
one	final	thing	--	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 disturb 	 ed 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	for	 year 	 s 	 	,	but	i	think	it	's	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	audience	.
 pleas 	 e 	 	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	,	stop	 refer 	 ring 	 	to	 your 	 s 	 elves 	 	 a 	 s 	 	``	 consumer 	 s 	 	.	``	ok	?
 consumer 	 s 	 	are	different	than	 citizen 	 s 	 	.
 consumer 	 s 	 	do	not	have	 oblig 	 ations 	 	,	 respons 	 ibilities 	 	and	 du 	 ties 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	fellow	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	you	're	using	that	word	consumer	in	the	public	 discuss 	 ion 	 	,	you	will	be	 de 	 grad 	 ing 	 	the	quality	of	the	 discuss 	 ion 	 	we	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	.
and	we	're	going	to	 continu 	 e 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 clue 	 less 	 	going	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	future	that	we	face	.
so	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.	 pleas 	 e 	 	go	out	and	do	what	you	can	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	a	land	full	of	 place 	 s 	 	that	are	worth	 car 	 ing 	 	about	and	a	nation	that	will	be	worth	 defend 	 ing 	 	.
