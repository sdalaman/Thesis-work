it	's	a	great	pleasure	to	be	here	.
it	's	a	great	pleasure	to	speak	after	brian	cox	from	cern	.
i	think	cern	is	the	home	of	the	large	hadron	collider	.
what	ever	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	the	small	hadron	collider	?
where	is	the	small	hadron	collider	?
 be 	 cause 	 	the	small	hadron	collider	once	was	the	big	thing	.
now	,	the	small	hadron	collider	is	in	a	 cup 	 board 	 	,	 overlook 	 ed 	 	and	 neglect 	 ed 	 	.
you	know	when	the	large	hadron	collider	 start 	 ed 	 	,	and	it	did	n't	work	,	and	people	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	work	out	why	,	it	was	the	small	hadron	collider	team	who	 sabotage 	 d 	 	it	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	so	jealous	.
the	whole	hadron	collider	family	 need 	 s 	 	 un 	 lock 	 ing 	 	.
the	 less 	 on 	 	of	brian	's	 present 	 ation 	 	,	in	a	way	--	all	 t 	 hose 	 	fantastic	 picture 	 s 	 	--	is	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	:	that	 van 	 t 	 age 	 	point	 determine 	 s 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	that	you	see	.
what	brian	was	 say 	 ing 	 	was	science	 ha 	 s 	 	 open 	 ed 	 	up	 success 	 ively 	 	different	 van 	 t 	 age 	 	 point 	 s 	 	from	which	we	can	see	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,
and	that	's	why	it	's	so	 valu 	 able 	 	.
so	the	 van 	 t 	 age 	 	point	you	take	 determine 	 s 	 	 virtual 	 ly 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	that	you	will	see	.
the	question	that	you	will	ask	will	determine	much	of	the	answer	that	you	get	.
and	so	if	you	ask	 th 	 is 	 	question	:	where	would	you	look	to	see	the	future	of	education	?
the	answer	that	we	've	 tradition 	 ally 	 	 give 	 n 	 	to	that	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 straight 	 forward 	 	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	in	the	last	20	 year 	 s 	 	:
you	go	to	finland	.
finland	is	the	best	place	in	the	world	to	see	school	 system 	 s 	 	.
the	finns	may	be	a	bit	 bor 	 ing 	 	and	 depress 	 ive 	 	and	there	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	high	 su 	 icide 	 	rate	,	but	by	 go 	 lly 	 	,	they	are	 qual 	 ified 	 	.
and	they	have	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	education	 system 	 s 	 	.
so	we	all	troop	off	to	finland	,	and	we	wonder	at	the	social	 democrat 	 ic 	 	miracle	of	finland	and	 it 	 s 	 	cultural	 homogen 	 e 	 ity 	 	and	all	the	rest	of	it	,	and	then	we	struggle	to	imagine	how	we	might	 br 	 ing 	 	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	back	.
well	,	so	,	for	 th 	 is 	 	last	year	,	with	the	help	of	cisco	who	 sponsor 	 ed 	 	me	,	for	some	 balm 	 y 	 	reason	,	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	looking	 some 	 where 	 	else	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	radical	 innov 	 ation 	 	 do 	 es 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	come	from	the	 ver 	 y 	 	best	,	but	it	often	 come 	 s 	 	from	 place 	 s 	 	where	you	have	huge	need	--	 un 	 met 	 	,	 lat 	 ent 	 	demand	--	and	not	 en 	 ough 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	for	 tradition 	 al 	 	 solution 	 s 	 	to	work	--	 tradition 	 al 	 	,	high	-	cost	 solution 	 s 	 	,	which	depend	on	 professional 	 s 	 	,	which	is	what	 school 	 s 	 	and	 hospital 	 s 	 	are	.
so	i	 end 	 ed 	 	up	in	 place 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	place	 call 	 ed 	 	monkey	hill	.
it	's	one	of	the	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 favela 	 s 	 	in	rio	.
most	of	the	population	growth	of	the	next	50	 year 	 s 	 	will	be	in	cities	.
we	'll	grow	by	six	cities	of	12	million	people	a	year	for	the	next	30	 year 	 s 	 	.
 al 	 most 	 	all	of	that	growth	will	be	in	the	 develop 	 ed 	 	world	.
 al 	 most 	 	all	of	that	growth	will	be	in	 place 	 s 	 	like	monkey	hill	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	where	you	'll	find	the	 fast 	 est 	 	growing	young	 population 	 s 	 	of	the	world	.
so	if	you	want	 recipe 	 s 	 	to	work	--	for	 virtual 	 ly 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	--	health	,	education	,	government	 politic 	 s 	 	and	education	--	you	have	to	go	to	these	 place 	 s 	 	.
and	if	you	go	to	these	 place 	 s 	 	,	you	meet	people	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	guy	 call 	 ed 	 	juanderson	.
at	the	age	of	14	,	in	common	with	 man 	 y 	 	14	-	year	-	olds	in	the	brazilian	education	system	,	he	 drop 	 ped 	 	out	of	school	.
it	was	 bor 	 ing 	 	.
and	juanderson	,	 in 	 stead 	 	,	went	 in 	 to 	 	what	 provide 	 d 	 	kind	of	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	and	hope	in	the	place	that	he	lived	,	which	was	the	 drug 	 s 	 	trade	.
and	by	the	age	of	16	,	with	rapid	 pro 	 motion 	 	,	he	was	running	the	 drug 	 s 	 	trade	in	10	 favela 	 s 	 	.
he	was	 turn 	 ing 	 	over	200,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	week	.
he	 employ 	 ed 	 	200	people	.
he	was	going	to	be	dead	by	the	age	of	25	.
and	 luck 	 ily 	 	,	he	met	 th 	 is 	 	guy	,	who	is	rodrigo	baggio	,	the	owner	of	the	first	 lap 	 top 	 	to	ever	appear	in	brazil	.
1994	,	rodrigo	 start 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	cdi	,	which	took	 computer 	 s 	 	 don 	 ated 	 	by	 corporation 	 s 	 	,	put	them	 in 	 to 	 	community	 center 	 s 	 	in	 favela 	 s 	 	and	 create 	 d 	 	 place 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
what	 turn 	 ed 	 	juanderson	around	was	technology	for	 learn 	 ing 	 	that	made	 learn 	 ing 	 	 f 	 un 	 	and	 access 	 ible 	 	.
or	you	can	go	to	 place 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	kibera	,	which	is	the	largest	 s 	 lum 	 	in	east	africa	.
 million 	 s 	 	of	people	living	here	,	 stretch 	 ed 	 	over	 man 	 y 	 	 kilometer 	 s 	 	.
and	there	i	met	these	two	,	azra	on	the	left	,	maureen	on	the	right	.
they	just	 finish 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	kenyan	certificate	of	 second 	 ary 	 	education	.
that	name	should	tell	you	that	the	kenyan	education	system	 borrow 	 s 	 	 al 	 most 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	from	britain	,	circa	1950	,	but	 ha 	 s 	 	 manage 	 d 	 	to	make	it	even	 wo 	 rse 	 	.
so	there	are	 school 	 s 	 	in	 s 	 lum 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
they	're	 place 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
that	's	where	maureen	went	to	school	.
they	're	private	 school 	 s 	 	.	there	are	no	state	 school 	 s 	 	in	 s 	 lum 	 s 	 	.
and	the	education	they	got	was	 pit 	 iful 	 	.
it	was	in	 place 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	a	school	set	up	by	some	 n 	 un 	 s 	 	in	 an 	 other 	 	 s 	 lum 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	nakuru	.
half	the	children	in	 th 	 is 	 	 class 	 room 	 	have	no	 parent 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	've	 di 	 ed 	 	through	 aid 	 s 	 	.
the	other	half	have	one	parent	 be 	 cause 	 	the	other	parent	 ha 	 s 	 	 di 	 ed 	 	through	 aid 	 s 	 	.
so	the	 challeng 	 es 	 	of	education	in	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	place	are	not	to	learn	the	 king 	 s 	 	and	 que 	 en 	 s 	 	of	kenya	or	britain	.
they	are	to	stay	 al 	 ive 	 	,	to	earn	a	living	,	to	not	 be 	 come 	 	hiv	positive	.
the	one	technology	that	 span 	 s 	 	rich	and	poor	in	 place 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 any 	 thing 	 	to	do	with	industrial	technology	.
it	's	not	to	do	with	 electric 	 ity 	 	or	water	.
it	's	the	mobile	phone	.
if	you	want	to	design	from	scratch	 virtual 	 ly 	 	any	service	in	africa	,	you	would	start	now	with	the	mobile	phone	.
or	you	could	go	to	 place 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	place	 call 	 ed 	 	the	madangiri	 settle 	 ment 	 	 colon 	 y 	 	,	which	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	 s 	 lum 	 	about	25	 minute 	 s 	 	 out 	 side 	 	new	delhi	,	where	i	met	these	 character 	 s 	 	who	 show 	 ed 	 	me	around	for	the	day	.
the	 remark 	 able 	 	thing	about	these	 girl 	 s 	 	,	and	the	sign	of	the	kind	of	social	revolution	 s 	 weep 	 ing 	 	through	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	is	that	these	 girl 	 s 	 	are	not	married	.
ten	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	they	 certain 	 ly 	 	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	married	.
now	they	're	not	married	,	and	they	want	to	go	on	to	 stud 	 y 	 	further	,	to	have	a	 care 	 er 	 	.
they	've	 be 	 en 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	up	by	 mother 	 s 	 	who	are	illiterate	,	who	have	never	ever	 d 	 one 	 	 home 	 work 	 	.
all	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	there	are	 million 	 s 	 	of	 parent 	 s 	 	--	 ten 	 s 	 	,	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	--	who	for	the	first	time	are	with	children	 do 	 ing 	 	 home 	 work 	 	and	 ex 	 am 	 s 	 	.
and	the	reason	they	carry	on	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	is	not	 be 	 cause 	 	they	went	to	a	school	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	private	school	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	fee	-	pay	school	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	good	school	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	best	you	can	get	in	hyderabad	in	indian	education	.
the	reason	they	went	on	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	was	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	computer	 install 	 ed 	 	in	the	 en 	 trance 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 s 	 lum 	 	by	a	 revolution 	 ary 	 	social	entrepreneur	 call 	 ed 	 	sugata	mitra	who	 ha 	 s 	 	 conduct 	 ed 	 	the	most	radical	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	 show 	 ing 	 	that	children	,	in	the	right	 condition 	 s 	 	,	can	learn	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	with	the	help	of	 computer 	 s 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	 girl 	 s 	 	have	never	 touch 	 ed 	 	google	.
they	know	 noth 	 ing 	 	about	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	.
imagine	what	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	would	be	like	if	you	could	get	that	to	them	.
so	if	you	look	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	did	,	through	 th 	 is 	 	tour	,	and	by	looking	at	about	a	hundred	case	 stud 	 ies 	 	of	different	social	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	in	these	 ver 	 y 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	,	look	at	the	 recipe 	 s 	 	that	they	come	up	with	for	 learn 	 ing 	 	,	they	look	 noth 	 ing 	 	like	school	.
what	do	they	look	like	?
well	,	education	is	a	global	 relig 	 ion 	 	.
and	education	,	plus	technology	,	is	a	great	source	of	hope	.
you	can	go	to	 place 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	school	three	 hour 	 s 	 	 out 	 side 	 	of	sao	paulo	.
most	of	the	children	there	have	 parent 	 s 	 	who	are	illiterate	.
 man 	 y 	 	of	them	do	n't	have	 electric 	 ity 	 	at	home	.
but	they	find	it	 complete 	 ly 	 	obvious	to	use	 computer 	 s 	 	,	 web 	 s 	 ites 	 	,	make	 video 	 s 	 	,	so	on	and	so	forth	.
when	you	go	to	 place 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	what	you	see	is	that	education	in	these	 setting 	 s 	 	 work 	 s 	 	by	pull	,	not	push	.
most	of	our	education	system	is	push	.
i	was	 liter 	 ally 	 	 push 	 ed 	 	to	school	.
when	you	get	to	school	,	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 push 	 ed 	 	at	you	:	knowledge	,	 ex 	 am 	 s 	 	,	 system 	 s 	 	,	 time 	 table 	 s 	 	.
if	you	want	to	attract	people	like	juanderson	who	could	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	buy	 gun 	 s 	 	,	wear	 jewel 	 ry 	 	,	ride	 motor 	 bike 	 s 	 	and	get	 girl 	 s 	 	through	the	 drug 	 s 	 	trade	,	and	you	want	to	attract	him	 in 	 to 	 	education	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	 com 	 puls 	 ory 	 	curriculum	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	make	sense	.
that	is	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	going	to	attract	him	.
you	need	to	pull	him	.
and	so	education	 need 	 s 	 	to	work	by	pull	,	not	push	.
and	so	the	idea	of	a	curriculum	is	 complete 	 ly 	 	 ir 	 relevant 	 	in	a	setting	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
you	need	to	start	education	from	 thing 	 s 	 	that	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	to	them	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 setting 	 s 	 	.
what	 do 	 es 	 	that	?
well	,	the	key	is	 motiv 	 ation 	 	,	and	there	are	two	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	to	it	.
one	is	to	deliver	 extr 	 in 	 s 	 ic 	 	 motiv 	 ation 	 	,
that	education	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 pay 	 off 	 	.
our	education	 system 	 s 	 	all	work	on	the	principle	that	there	is	a	 pay 	 off 	 	,	but	you	have	to	wait	 quit 	 e 	 	a	long	time	.
that	's	too	long	if	you	're	poor	.
 wait 	 ing 	 	10	 year 	 s 	 	for	the	 pay 	 off 	 	from	education	is	too	long	when	you	need	to	meet	 dai 	 ly 	 	 need 	 s 	 	,	when	you	've	got	 s 	 i 	 bling 	 s 	 	to	look	after	or	a	business	to	help	with	.
so	you	need	education	to	be	relevant	and	help	people	to	make	a	living	there	and	then	,	often	.
and	you	 al 	 so 	 	need	to	make	it	 intrinsic 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
so	time	and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	i	found	people	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	guy	,	sebastiao	rocha	,	in	belo	horizonte	,	in	the	third	largest	city	in	brazil	.
he	's	 invent 	 ed 	 	more	than	200	 game 	 s 	 	to	teach	 virtual 	 ly 	 	any	subject	under	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
in	the	 school 	 s 	 	and	 commun 	 ities 	 	that	taio	 work 	 s 	 	in	,	the	day	 al 	 ways 	 	 start 	 s 	 	in	a	circle	and	 al 	 ways 	 	 start 	 s 	 	from	a	question	.
imagine	an	education	system	that	 start 	 ed 	 	from	 question 	 s 	 	,	not	from	knowledge	to	be	 im 	 part 	 ed 	 	,	or	 start 	 ed 	 	from	a	game	,	not	from	a	 less 	 on 	 	,	or	 start 	 ed 	 	from	the	 pre 	 mise 	 	that	you	have	to	engage	people	first	before	you	can	possibly	teach	them	.
our	education	 system 	 s 	 	,	you	do	all	that	stuff	 after 	 ward 	 	,	if	you	're	 luck 	 y 	 	,	 s 	 port 	 	,	drama	,	music	.
these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	they	teach	through	.
they	attract	people	to	 learn 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	a	dance	project	or	a	circus	project	or	,	the	best	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	all	--	el	sistema	in	venezuela	--	it	's	a	music	project	.
and	so	you	attract	people	through	that	 in 	 to 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	,	not	 add 	 ing 	 	that	on	after	all	the	 learn 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	and	you	've	eaten	your	cognitive	 green 	 s 	 	.
so	el	sistema	in	venezuela	uses	a	 viol 	 in 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	technology	of	 learn 	 ing 	 	.
taio	rocha	uses	making	soap	 a 	 s 	 	a	technology	of	 learn 	 ing 	 	.
and	what	you	find	when	you	go	to	these	 scheme 	 s 	 	is	that	they	use	people	and	 place 	 s 	 	in	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	creative	ways	.
 masse 	 s 	 	of	peer	 learn 	 ing 	 	.
how	do	you	get	 learn 	 ing 	 	to	people	when	there	are	no	 teacher 	 s 	 	,	when	 teacher 	 s 	 	wo	n't	come	,	when	you	ca	n't	afford	them	,	and	even	if	you	do	get	 teacher 	 s 	 	,	what	they	teach	is	n't	relevant	to	the	 commun 	 ities 	 	that	they	serve	?
well	,	you	create	your	own	 teacher 	 s 	 	.
you	create	peer	-	to	-	peer	 learn 	 ing 	 	,	or	you	create	para	-	 teacher 	 s 	 	,	or	you	 br 	 ing 	 	in	 special 	 ist 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	.
but	you	find	ways	to	get	 learn 	 ing 	 	that	's	relevant	to	people	through	technology	,	people	and	 place 	 s 	 	that	are	different	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	school	in	a	bus	on	a	building	 s 	 ite 	 	in	pune	,	the	 fast 	 est 	 	growing	city	in	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	.
pune	 ha 	 s 	 	5,000	building	 s 	 ites 	 	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	30,000	children	on	 t 	 hose 	 	building	 s 	 ites 	 	.
that	's	one	city	.
imagine	that	urban	explosion	that	's	going	to	take	place	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	and	how	 man 	 y 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	children	will	 s 	 pend 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	school	 year 	 s 	 	on	building	 s 	 ites 	 	.
well	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	scheme	to	get	the	 learn 	 ing 	 	to	them	through	a	bus	.
and	they	all	treat	 learn 	 ing 	 	,	not	 a 	 s 	 	some	sort	of	academic	,	 analytic 	 al 	 	activity	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	that	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	productive	,	 some 	 thing 	 	you	make	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	you	can	do	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	earn	a	living	from	.
so	i	met	 th 	 is 	 	character	,	steven	.
he	'd	 s 	 pent 	 	three	 year 	 s 	 	in	nairobi	living	on	the	 street 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	his	 parent 	 s 	 	had	 di 	 ed 	 	of	 aid 	 s 	 	.
and	he	was	 final 	 ly 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	back	 in 	 to 	 	school	,	not	by	the	 off 	 er 	 	of	gcses	,	but	by	the	 off 	 er 	 	of	 learn 	 ing 	 	how	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	 carp 	 enter 	 	,	a	practical	making	skill	.
so	the	 trend 	 iest 	 	 school 	 s 	 	in	the	world	,	high	tech	high	and	 other 	 s 	 	,	they	 e 	 spouse 	 	a	 philosoph 	 y 	 	of	 learn 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	productive	activity	.
here	,	there	is	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	an	option	.
 learn 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	productive	in	order	for	it	to	make	sense	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	they	have	a	different	model	of	scale	,
and	it	's	a	chinese	restaurant	model	of	how	to	scale	.
and	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	it	from	 th 	 is 	 	guy	,	who	is	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	character	.
he	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	most	 remark 	 able 	 	social	entrepreneur	in	education	in	the	world	.
his	name	is	madhav	chavan	,	and	he	 create 	 d 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	pratham	.
and	pratham	 run 	 s 	 	 pre 	 school 	 	play	 group 	 s 	 	for	,	now	,	21	million	children	in	india	.
it	's	the	largest	ngo	in	education	in	the	world	.
and	it	 al 	 so 	 	 support 	 s 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	-	class	 kid 	 s 	 	going	 in 	 to 	 	indian	 school 	 s 	 	.
he	's	a	complete	 revolution 	 ary 	 	.
he	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	trade	 un 	 ion 	 	 organize 	 r 	 	by	 back 	 ground 	 	,
and	that	's	how	he	 learn 	 ed 	 	the	 skill 	 s 	 	to	build	his	 organ 	 ization 	 	.
when	they	got	to	a	certain	stage	,	pratham	got	big	 en 	 ough 	 	to	attract	some	pro	bono	support	from	mckinsey	.
mckinsey	came	 a 	 long 	 	and	 look 	 ed 	 	at	his	model	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	know	what	you	should	do	with	 th 	 is 	 	,	madhav	?
you	should	turn	it	 in 	 to 	 	mcdonald	's	.
and	what	you	do	when	you	go	to	any	new	 s 	 ite 	 	is	you	kind	of	roll	out	a	franchise	.
and	it	's	the	same	 where 	 ver 	 	you	go	.
it	's	 reli 	 able 	 	and	people	know	 exact 	 ly 	 	where	they	are	.
and	there	will	be	no	 mistak 	 es 	 	.	``
and	madhav	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	why	do	we	have	to	do	it	that	way	?
why	ca	n't	we	do	it	more	like	the	chinese	 restaurant 	 s 	 	?	``	there	are	chinese	 restaurant 	 s 	 	 every 	 where 	 	,	but	there	is	no	chinese	restaurant	chain	.
yet	,	 every 	 one 	 	 know 	 s 	 	what	is	a	chinese	restaurant	.
they	know	what	to	expect	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	it	'll	be	 sub 	 t 	 ly 	 	different	and	the	 color 	 s 	 	will	be	different	and	the	name	will	be	different	.
you	know	a	chinese	restaurant	when	you	see	it	.
these	people	work	with	the	chinese	restaurant	model	--
same	 principle 	 s 	 	,	different	 application 	 s 	 	and	different	 setting 	 s 	 	--
not	the	mcdonald	's	model	.
the	mcdonald	's	model	 scale 	 s 	 	.
the	chinese	restaurant	model	 spread 	 s 	 	.
so	mass	education	 start 	 ed 	 	with	social	 entrepreneur 	 ship 	 	in	the	19th	century	.
and	that	's	 desperate 	 ly 	 	what	we	need	 aga 	 in 	 	on	a	global	scale	.
and	what	can	we	learn	from	all	of	that	?
well	,	we	can	learn	a	lot	 be 	 cause 	 	our	education	 system 	 s 	 	are	 fail 	 ing 	 	 desperate 	 ly 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	.
they	fail	to	reach	the	people	they	most	need	to	serve	.
they	often	hit	 the 	 ir 	 	target	but	 mis 	 s 	 	the	point	.
 improve 	 ment 	 	is	 increasing 	 ly 	 	difficult	to	organize	;
our	faith	in	these	 system 	 s 	 	,	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 frau 	 ght 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	way	of	 understand 	 ing 	 	what	kind	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	what	kind	of	different	design	we	need	.
there	are	two	 bas 	 ic 	 	 type 	 s 	 	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
there	's	 sustain 	 ing 	 	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	which	will	sustain	an	 exist 	 ing 	 	institution	or	an	 organ 	 ization 	 	,	and	 disrupt 	 ive 	 	 innov 	 ation 	 	that	will	break	it	 a 	 part 	 	,	create	some	different	way	of	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
there	are	 form 	 al 	 	 setting 	 s 	 	--	 school 	 s 	 	,	 college 	 s 	 	,	 hospital 	 s 	 	--	in	which	 innov 	 ation 	 	can	take	place	,	and	 inform 	 al 	 	 setting 	 s 	 	--	 commun 	 ities 	 	,	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	,	social	 network 	 s 	 	.
 al 	 most 	 	all	our	effort	 go 	 es 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	box	,	 sustain 	 ing 	 	 innov 	 ation 	 	in	 form 	 al 	 	 setting 	 s 	 	,	 get 	 ting 	 	a	better	version	of	the	 essential 	 ly 	 	bismarckian	school	system	that	 develop 	 ed 	 	in	the	19th	century	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	the	trouble	with	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	,	in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	there	just	are	n't	 teacher 	 s 	 	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	model	work	.
you	'd	need	 million 	 s 	 	and	 million 	 s 	 	of	 teacher 	 s 	 	in	 chin 	 a 	 	,	india	,	nigeria	and	the	rest	of	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	to	meet	need	.
and	in	our	system	,	we	know	that	 simpl 	 y 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	more	of	 th 	 is 	 	wo	n't	eat	 in 	 to 	 	deep	 education 	 al 	 	 in 	 equal 	 ities 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	in	inner	cities	and	 form 	 er 	 	industrial	 area 	 s 	 	.
so	that	's	why	we	need	three	more	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
we	need	more	 re 	 invent 	 ion 	 	.
and	all	around	the	world	now	you	see	more	and	more	 school 	 s 	 	 re 	 invent 	 ing 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
they	're	 re 	 cogniz 	 ably 	 	 school 	 s 	 	,	but	they	look	different	.
there	are	big	picture	 school 	 s 	 	in	the	u.s.	and	australia	.
there	are	kunskapsskolan	 school 	 s 	 	in	sweden	.
of	14	of	them	,	 on 	 ly 	 	two	of	them	are	in	 school 	 s 	 	.
most	of	them	are	in	other	 building 	 s 	 	not	designed	 a 	 s 	 	 school 	 s 	 	.
there	is	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	school	in	northen	queensland	 call 	 ed 	 	jaringan	.
and	they	all	have	the	same	kind	of	 feature 	 s 	 	:	 high 	 ly 	 	 collabor 	 ative 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 personal 	 ized 	 	,	often	pervasive	technology	,
 learn 	 ing 	 	that	 start 	 s 	 	from	 question 	 s 	 	and	 problem 	 s 	 	and	 project 	 s 	 	,	not	from	knowledge	and	curriculum	.
so	we	 certain 	 ly 	 	need	more	of	that	.
but	 be 	 cause 	 	so	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 issue 	 s 	 	in	education	are	n't	just	in	school	,	they	're	in	family	and	community	,	what	you	 al 	 so 	 	need	,	 definite 	 ly 	 	,	is	more	on	the	right	hand	side	.
you	need	 effort 	 s 	 	to	supplement	 school 	 s 	 	.
the	most	famous	of	these	is	reggio	emilia	in	italy	,	the	family	-	based	 learn 	 ing 	 	system	to	support	and	 encourag 	 e 	 	people	in	 school 	 s 	 	.
the	most	 excit 	 ing 	 	is	the	harlem	children	's	zone	,	which	over	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	led	by	geoffrey	canada	,	 ha 	 s 	 	,	through	a	 mix 	 ture 	 	of	 school 	 ing 	 	and	family	and	community	 project 	 s 	 	,	 attempt 	 ed 	 	to	transform	not	just	education	in	 school 	 s 	 	,	but	the	entire	culture	and	 aspir 	 ation 	 	of	about	10,000	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	in	harlem	.
we	need	more	of	that	 complete 	 ly 	 	new	and	radical	 think 	 ing 	 	.
you	can	go	to	 place 	 s 	 	an	hour	away	,	less	,	from	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	just	down	the	road	,	which	need	that	,	which	need	 radical 	 ism 	 	of	a	kind	that	we	have	n't	 imagin 	 ed 	 	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	you	need	 transform 	 ation 	 al 	 	 innov 	 ation 	 	that	could	imagine	 get 	 ting 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	to	people	in	 complete 	 ly 	 	new	and	different	ways	.
so	we	are	on	the	 ver 	 ge 	 	,	2015	,	of	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 achiev 	 ement 	 	,	the	 school 	 ification 	 	of	the	world	.
every	child	up	to	the	age	of	15	who	 want 	 s 	 	a	place	in	school	will	be	able	to	have	one	in	2015	.
it	's	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	thing	.
but	it	is	,	 un 	 like 	 	 car 	 s 	 	,	which	have	 develop 	 ed 	 	so	 rapid 	 ly 	 	and	 order 	 ly 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	school	system	is	 re 	 cogniz 	 ably 	 	an	 inherit 	 ance 	 	from	the	19th	century	,	from	a	bismarkian	model	of	german	 school 	 ing 	 	that	got	taken	up	by	english	 reform 	 ers 	 	,	and	often	by	religious	 mission 	 aries 	 	,	taken	up	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	force	of	social	 cohes 	 ion 	 	,	and	then	in	japan	and	south	korea	 a 	 s 	 	they	 develop 	 ed 	 	.
it	's	 re 	 cogniz 	 ably 	 	19th	century	in	 it 	 s 	 	 root 	 s 	 	.
and	of	course	it	's	a	huge	 achiev 	 ement 	 	.
and	of	course	it	will	 br 	 ing 	 	great	 thing 	 s 	 	.
it	will	 br 	 ing 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	and	 learn 	 ing 	 	and	 read 	 ing 	 	.
but	it	will	 al 	 so 	 	lay	waste	to	 imagin 	 ation 	 	.
it	will	lay	waste	to	 appetit 	 e 	 	.	it	will	lay	waste	to	social	confidence	.
it	will	 strat 	 ify 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	it	 liberate 	 s 	 	it	.
and	we	are	 bequea 	 thing 	 	to	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	school	 system 	 s 	 	that	they	will	now	 s 	 pend 	 	a	century	 try 	 ing 	 	to	reform	.
that	is	why	we	need	 re 	 ally 	 	radical	 think 	 ing 	 	,	and	why	radical	 think 	 ing 	 	is	now	more	possible	and	more	 need 	 ed 	 	than	ever	in	how	we	learn	.
thank	you	.
