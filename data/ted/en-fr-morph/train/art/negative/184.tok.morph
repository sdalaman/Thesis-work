well	,	 a 	 s 	 	chris	 point 	 ed 	 	out	,	i	 stud 	 y 	 	the	human	brain	,	the	 function 	 s 	 	and	structure	of	the	human	brain	.
and	i	just	want	you	to	think	for	a	minute	about	what	 th 	 is 	 	 en 	 tail 	 s 	 	.
here	is	 th 	 is 	 	mass	of	jelly	,	three	-	pound	mass	of	jelly	you	can	hold	in	the	palm	of	your	hand	,	and	it	can	 contempl 	 ate 	 	the	 vast 	 ness 	 	of	 inter 	 stellar 	 	space	.
it	can	 contempl 	 ate 	 	the	meaning	of	 in 	 fin 	 ity 	 	and	it	can	 contempl 	 ate 	 	 it 	 self 	 	 contempl 	 ating 	 	on	the	meaning	of	 in 	 fin 	 ity 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	peculiar	 recur 	 s 	 ive 	 	quality	that	we	call	self	-	 aware 	 ness 	 	,	which	i	think	is	the	holy	 g 	 rail 	 	of	 neuro 	 science 	 	,	of	 neuro 	 logy 	 	,	and	 hope 	 fully 	 	,	 some 	 day 	 	,	we	'll	understand	how	that	 happen 	 s 	 	.
ok	,	so	how	do	you	 stud 	 y 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 myster 	 ious 	 	organ	?
i	mean	,	you	have	100	billion	nerve	 cell 	 s 	 	,	little	 wis 	 ps 	 	of	 proto 	 pla 	 sm 	 	,	 interact 	 ing 	 	with	each	other	,	and	from	 th 	 is 	 	activity	 emerge 	 s 	 	the	whole	spectrum	of	abilities	that	we	call	human	nature	and	human	 conscious 	 ness 	 	.
how	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	happen	?
well	,	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	ways	of	 approach 	 ing 	 	the	 function 	 s 	 	of	the	human	brain	.
one	approach	,	the	one	we	use	 main 	 ly 	 	,	is	to	look	at	 patient 	 s 	 	with	 sustain 	 ed 	 	damage	to	a	small	region	of	the	brain	,	where	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	genetic	change	in	a	small	region	of	the	brain	.
what	then	 happen 	 s 	 	is	not	an	 a 	 cross 	 	-	the	-	board	 r 	 eduction 	 	in	all	your	mental	 cap 	 a 	 cities 	 	,	a	sort	of	 blunt 	 ing 	 	of	your	cognitive	ability	.
what	you	get	is	a	 high 	 ly 	 	 select 	 ive 	 	loss	of	one	function	,	with	other	 function 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 preserve 	 d 	 	 in 	 tact 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 give 	 s 	 	you	some	confidence	in	 assert 	 ing 	 	that	that	part	of	the	brain	is	 some 	 how 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 media 	 ting 	 	that	function	.
so	you	can	then	map	function	onto	structure	,	and	then	find	out	what	the	 circuit 	 ry 	 	's	 do 	 ing 	 	to	generate	that	 part 	 icular 	 	function	.
so	that	's	what	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	.
so	let	me	give	you	a	few	 s 	 tri 	 king 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
in	fact	,	i	'm	giving	you	three	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	,	six	 minute 	 s 	 	each	,	 dur 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	talk	.
the	first	 ex 	 ample 	 	is	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	syndrome	 call 	 ed 	 	capgras	syndrome	.
if	you	look	at	the	first	slide	there	,	that	's	the	temporal	 lobe 	 s 	 	,	frontal	 lobe 	 s 	 	,	 par 	 ietal 	 	 lobe 	 s 	 	,	ok	--	the	 lobe 	 s 	 	that	constitute	the	brain	.
and	if	you	look	,	 tuck 	 ed 	 	away	 in 	 side 	 	the	inner	surface	of	the	temporal	 lobe 	 s 	 	--	you	ca	n't	see	it	there	--	is	a	little	structure	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 f 	 usi 	 form 	 	 gy 	 rus 	 	.
and	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	face	area	in	the	brain	,	 be 	 cause 	 	when	it	's	 damage 	 d 	 	,	you	can	no	 long 	 er 	 	 recogn 	 ize 	 	people	's	 face 	 s 	 	.
you	can	still	 recogn 	 ize 	 	them	from	 the 	 ir 	 	voice	and	say	,	``	oh	 yea 	 h 	 	,	that	's	joe	,	``	but	you	ca	n't	look	at	 the 	 ir 	 	face	and	know	who	it	is	,	right	?
you	ca	n't	even	 recogn 	 ize 	 	 your 	 self 	 	in	the	mirror	.
i	mean	,	you	know	it	's	you	 be 	 cause 	 	you	wink	and	it	 wink 	 s 	 	,	and	you	know	it	's	a	mirror	,	but	you	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 recogn 	 ize 	 	 your 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 your 	 self 	 	.
ok	.	now	that	syndrome	is	well	known	 a 	 s 	 	 caus 	 ed 	 	by	damage	to	the	 f 	 usi 	 form 	 	 gy 	 rus 	 	.
but	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	rare	syndrome	,	so	rare	,	in	fact	,	that	 ver 	 y 	 	few	 physician 	 s 	 	have	heard	about	it	,	not	even	 neuro 	 logists 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	capgras	delusion	,
and	that	is	a	patient	,	who	's	 other 	 wise 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	normal	,	 ha 	 s 	 	had	a	head	 in 	 jury 	 	,	 come 	 s 	 	out	of	 com 	 a 	 	,
 other 	 wise 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	normal	,	he	 look 	 s 	 	at	his	mother	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	 look 	 s 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	like	my	mother	,	 th 	 is 	 	woman	,	but	she	's	an	 im 	 post 	 or 	 	.	she	's	some	other	woman	 pretend 	 ing 	 	to	be	my	mother	.	``	now	,	why	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	happen	?
why	would	 some 	 body 	 	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	person	is	 perfect 	 ly 	 	lucid	and	intelligent	in	all	other	 respect 	 s 	 	,	but	when	he	 s 	 ees 	 	his	mother	,	his	delusion	 kick 	 s 	 	in	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	it	's	not	mother	.
now	,	the	most	common	 interpret 	 ation 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	which	you	find	in	all	the	 psych 	 iatry 	 	 text 	 book 	 s 	 	,	is	a	freudian	view	,	and	that	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	chap	--	and	the	same	argument	 appli 	 es 	 	to	women	,	by	the	way	,	but	i	'll	just	talk	about	 guy 	 s 	 	.	when	you	're	a	little	baby	,	a	young	baby	,	you	had	a	strong	sexual	 attract 	 ion 	 	to	your	mother	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	oedipus	complex	of	freud	.
i	'm	not	 say 	 ing 	 	i	 believ 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	standard	freudian	view	.
and	then	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	grow	up	,	the	cortex	 develop 	 s 	 	,	and	 inhibit 	 s 	 	these	 lat 	 ent 	 	sexual	 urge 	 s 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	your	mother	.
thank	god	,	or	you	would	all	be	 sexual 	 ly 	 	 arouse 	 d 	 	when	you	saw	your	mother	.
and	then	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	,	there	's	a	blow	to	your	head	,	 dam 	 aging 	 	the	cortex	,	 allow 	 ing 	 	these	 lat 	 ent 	 	sexual	 urge 	 s 	 	to	emerge	,	flaming	to	the	surface	,	and	 sudden 	 ly 	 	and	 in 	 ex 	 plic 	 ably 	 	you	find	 your 	 self 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 sexual 	 ly 	 	 arouse 	 d 	 	by	your	mother	.
and	you	say	,	``	my	god	,	if	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	mom	,	how	come	i	'm	 be 	 ing 	 	 sexual 	 ly 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	on	?
she	's	some	other	woman	.	she	's	an	 im 	 post 	 or 	 	.	``	it	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 interpret 	 ation 	 	that	 make 	 s 	 	sense	to	your	 damage 	 d 	 	brain	.
 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	never	made	much	sense	to	me	,	 th 	 is 	 	argument	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 ing 	 en 	 ious 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	all	freudian	 argument 	 s 	 	are	--
--	but	did	n't	make	much	sense	 be 	 cause 	 	i	have	 s 	 een 	 	the	same	delusion	,	a	patient	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	same	delusion	,	about	his	pet	 poo 	 d 	 le 	 	.
he	'll	say	,	``	doctor	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	fifi	.	it	 look 	 s 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	like	fifi	,	but	it	's	some	other	dog	.	``	right	?
now	,	you	try	using	the	freudian	 explan 	 ation 	 	there	.
you	'll	start	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	 lat 	 ent 	 	 best 	 ial 	 ity 	 	in	all	 human 	 s 	 	,	or	some	 s 	 uch 	 	thing	,	which	is	 quit 	 e 	 	absurd	,	of	course	.
now	,	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	going	on	?
so	,	to	explain	 th 	 is 	 	 cur 	 ious 	 	 dis 	 order 	 	,	we	look	at	the	structure	and	 function 	 s 	 	of	the	normal	visual	 path 	 ways 	 	in	the	brain	.
 normal 	 ly 	 	,	visual	 signal 	 s 	 	come	in	,	 in 	 to 	 	the	 eye 	 ball 	 s 	 	,	go	to	the	visual	 area 	 s 	 	in	the	brain	.
there	are	,	in	fact	,	30	 area 	 s 	 	in	the	back	of	your	brain	 concern 	 ed 	 	with	just	vision	,	and	after	 process 	 ing 	 	all	that	,	the	 mess 	 age 	 	 go 	 es 	 	to	a	small	structure	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 f 	 usi 	 form 	 	 gy 	 rus 	 	,	where	you	perceive	 face 	 s 	 	.
there	are	 neuro 	 ns 	 	there	that	are	sensitive	to	 face 	 s 	 	.
you	can	call	it	the	face	area	of	the	brain	,	right	?
i	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	that	 ear 	 lier 	 	.
now	,	when	that	area	's	 damage 	 d 	 	,	you	lose	the	ability	to	see	 face 	 s 	 	,	right	?
but	from	that	area	,	the	 mess 	 age 	 	 cascad 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	structure	 call 	 ed 	 	the	amygdala	in	the	 limb 	 ic 	 	system	,	the	 emotion 	 al 	 	core	of	the	brain	,	and	that	structure	,	 call 	 ed 	 	the	amygdala	,	 gauge 	 s 	 	the	 emotion 	 al 	 	 sign 	 ific 	 ance 	 	of	what	you	're	looking	at	.
is	it	 pre 	 y 	 	?	is	it	predator	?	is	it	mate	?
or	is	it	 some 	 thing 	 	 absolute 	 ly 	 	trivial	,	like	a	piece	of	lint	,	or	a	piece	of	chalk	,	or	a	--	i	do	n't	want	to	point	to	that	,	but	--
or	a	shoe	,	or	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	?	ok	?
which	you	can	 complete 	 ly 	 	 ignor 	 e 	 	.
so	if	the	amygdala	is	 excit 	 ed 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	the	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	then	 cascad 	 e 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 auto 	 nomic 	 	nervous	system	.
your	heart	 start 	 s 	 	 beat 	 ing 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	.	you	start	 sweat 	 ing 	 	to	dissipate	the	heat	that	you	're	going	to	create	from	 mus 	 cular 	 	 exert 	 ion 	 	.
and	that	's	fortunate	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	can	put	two	 electro 	 de 	 s 	 	on	your	palm	and	measure	the	change	in	skin	 resist 	 ance 	 	 produce 	 d 	 	by	 sweat 	 ing 	 	.
so	i	can	determine	,	when	you	're	looking	at	 some 	 thing 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	you	're	 excit 	 ed 	 	or	 whet 	 her 	 	you	're	 arouse 	 d 	 	,	or	not	,	ok	?
and	i	'll	get	to	that	in	a	minute	.
so	my	idea	was	,	when	 th 	 is 	 	chap	 look 	 s 	 	at	an	object	,	when	he	 look 	 s 	 	at	his	--	any	object	for	that	matter	,	it	 go 	 es 	 	to	the	visual	 area 	 s 	 	and	,	 how 	 ever 	 	,	and	it	's	 process 	 ed 	 	in	the	 f 	 usi 	 form 	 	 gy 	 rus 	 	,	and	you	 recogn 	 ize 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	pea	plant	,	or	a	table	,	or	your	mother	,	for	that	matter	,	ok	?
and	then	the	 mess 	 age 	 	 cascad 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	amygdala	,	and	then	 go 	 es 	 	down	the	 auto 	 nomic 	 	nervous	system	.
but	 may 	 be 	 	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	chap	,	that	wire	that	 go 	 es 	 	from	the	amygdala	to	the	 limb 	 ic 	 	system	,	the	 emotion 	 al 	 	core	of	the	brain	,	is	cut	by	the	accident	.
so	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 f 	 usi 	 form 	 	is	 in 	 tact 	 	,	the	chap	can	still	 recogn 	 ize 	 	his	mother	,	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	oh	 yea 	 h 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	my	mother	.	``	but	 be 	 cause 	 	the	wire	is	cut	to	the	 emotion 	 al 	 	 center 	 s 	 	,	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	but	how	come	,	if	it	's	my	mother	,	i	do	n't	experience	a	 warm 	 th 	 	?	``	or	terror	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	case	may	be	?	right	?
and	 there 	 fore 	 	,	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	how	do	i	account	for	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 explicable 	 	lack	of	 emotion 	 s 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	ca	n't	be	my	mother	.
it	's	some	strange	woman	 pretend 	 ing 	 	to	be	my	mother	.	``	how	do	you	test	 th 	 is 	 	?
well	,	what	you	do	is	,	if	you	take	any	one	of	you	here	,	and	put	you	in	front	of	a	screen	,	and	measure	your	 galvan 	 ic 	 	skin	 respons 	 e 	 	,	and	show	 picture 	 s 	 	on	the	screen	,	i	can	measure	how	you	sweat	when	you	see	an	object	,	like	a	table	or	an	 um 	 br 	 ella 	 	.	of	course	,	you	do	n't	sweat	.
if	i	show	you	a	picture	of	a	lion	,	or	a	tiger	,	or	a	 pin 	 up 	 	,	you	start	 sweat 	 ing 	 	,	right	?
and	,	 believ 	 e 	 	it	or	not	,	if	i	show	you	a	picture	of	your	mother	--
i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	normal	people	--	you	start	 sweat 	 ing 	 	.
you	do	n't	even	have	to	be	jewish	.
now	,	what	 happen 	 s 	 	if	you	show	 th 	 is 	 	patient	?
you	take	the	patient	and	show	him	 picture 	 s 	 	on	the	screen	and	measure	his	 galvan 	 ic 	 	skin	 respons 	 e 	 	.
 table 	 s 	 	and	 chair 	 s 	 	and	lint	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	in	normal	people	,	but	when	you	show	him	a	picture	of	his	mother	,	the	 galvan 	 ic 	 	skin	 respons 	 e 	 	is	flat	.
there	's	no	 emotion 	 al 	 	 re 	 action 	 	to	his	mother	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	wire	going	from	the	visual	 area 	 s 	 	to	the	 emotion 	 al 	 	 center 	 s 	 	is	cut	.
so	his	vision	is	normal	 be 	 cause 	 	the	visual	 area 	 s 	 	are	normal	,	his	 emotion 	 s 	 	are	normal	--	he	'll	laugh	,	he	'll	cry	,	so	on	and	so	forth	--	but	the	wire	from	vision	to	 emotion 	 s 	 	is	cut	and	 there 	 fore 	 	he	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	delusion	that	his	mother	is	an	 im 	 post 	 or 	 	.
it	's	a	 love 	 ly 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	the	sort	of	thing	we	do	:	take	a	bizarre	,	 seem 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 in 	 comprehens 	 ible 	 	,	neural	 psych 	 iatric 	 	syndrome	and	say	that	the	standard	freudian	view	is	wrong	,	that	,	in	fact	,	you	can	come	up	with	a	precise	 explan 	 ation 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	known	neural	anatomy	of	the	brain	.
by	the	way	,	if	 th 	 is 	 	patient	then	 go 	 es 	 	,	and	mother	 phone 	 s 	 	from	an	 ad 	 ja 	 cent 	 	room	--	 phone 	 s 	 	him	--	and	he	 pick 	 s 	 	up	the	phone	,	and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 w 	 ow 	 	,	mom	,	how	are	you	?	where	are	you	?	``	there	's	no	delusion	through	the	phone	.
then	,	she	 approach 	 es 	 	him	after	an	hour	,	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	who	are	you	?
you	look	just	like	my	mother	.	``	ok	?
the	reason	is	there	's	a	 separat 	 e 	 	 path 	 way 	 	going	from	the	 hear 	 ing 	 	 center 	 s 	 	in	the	brain	to	the	 emotion 	 al 	 	 center 	 s 	 	,	and	that	's	not	 be 	 en 	 	cut	by	the	accident	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 explain 	 s 	 	why	through	the	phone	he	 recogn 	 ize 	 s 	 	his	mother	,	no	problem	.
when	he	 s 	 ees 	 	her	in	person	,	he	 say 	 s 	 	it	's	an	 im 	 post 	 or 	 	.
ok	,	how	is	all	 th 	 is 	 	complex	 circuit 	 ry 	 	set	up	in	the	brain	?
is	it	nature	,	 gene 	 s 	 	,	or	is	it	nurture	?
and	we	approach	 th 	 is 	 	problem	by	 consider 	 ing 	 	 an 	 other 	 	 cur 	 ious 	 	syndrome	 call 	 ed 	 	phantom	limb	.
and	you	all	know	what	a	phantom	limb	is	.
when	an	arm	is	 amput 	 ated 	 	,	or	a	leg	is	 amput 	 ated 	 	,	for	 gang 	 rene 	 	,	or	you	lose	it	in	war	--	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	in	the	 ir 	 aq 	 	war	,	it	's	now	a	serious	problem	--	you	 continu 	 e 	 	to	 vivi 	 d 	 ly 	 	feel	the	presence	of	that	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	arm	,	and	that	's	 call 	 ed 	 	a	phantom	arm	or	a	phantom	leg	.
in	fact	,	you	can	get	a	phantom	with	 al 	 most 	 	any	part	of	the	body	.
 believ 	 e 	 	it	or	not	,	even	with	internal	 visc 	 era 	 	.
i	've	had	 patient 	 s 	 	with	the	uterus	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	--	 hyster 	 ectomy 	 	--	who	have	a	phantom	uterus	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	phantom	 menstru 	 al 	 	 cramp 	 s 	 	at	the	appropriate	time	of	the	month	.
and	in	fact	,	one	student	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	the	other	day	,	``	do	they	get	phantom	pms	?	``	a	subject	 rip 	 e 	 	for	scientific	enquiry	,	but	we	have	n't	 pursue 	 d 	 	that	.
ok	,	now	the	next	question	is	,	what	can	you	learn	about	phantom	 limb 	 s 	 	by	 do 	 ing 	 	 experiment 	 s 	 	?
one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	've	found	was	,	about	half	the	 patient 	 s 	 	with	phantom	 limb 	 s 	 	claim	that	they	can	move	the	phantom	.
it	'll	pat	his	brother	on	the	shoulder	,	it	'll	answer	the	phone	when	it	 ring 	 s 	 	,	it	'll	wave	 good 	 bye 	 	.
these	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 compel 	 ling 	 	,	 vivi 	 d 	 	 sens 	 ations 	 	.
the	patient	's	not	 delusion 	 al 	 	.
he	 know 	 s 	 	that	the	arm	is	not	there	,	but	,	 never 	 the 	 less 	 	,	it	's	a	 compel 	 ling 	 	 sensor 	 y 	 	experience	for	the	patient	.
but	 how 	 ever 	 	,	about	half	the	 patient 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	happen	.
the	phantom	limb	--	they	'll	say	,	``	but	doctor	,	the	phantom	limb	is	 paralyze 	 d 	 	.
it	's	 fix 	 ed 	 	in	a	 clench 	 ed 	 	 s 	 pa 	 sm 	 	and	it	's	 excruciat 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 pain 	 ful 	 	.
if	 on 	 ly 	 	i	could	move	it	,	 may 	 be 	 	the	pain	will	be	 reliev 	 ed 	 	.	``	now	,	why	would	a	phantom	limb	be	 paralyze 	 d 	 	?
it	 sound 	 s 	 	like	an	 oxy 	 moron 	 	.
but	when	we	 we 	 re 	 	looking	at	the	case	 sheet 	 s 	 	,	what	we	found	was	,	these	people	with	the	 paralyze 	 d 	 	phantom	 limb 	 s 	 	,	the	original	arm	was	 paralyze 	 d 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 per 	 iph 	 er 	 al 	 	nerve	 in 	 jury 	 	.
the	actual	nerve	 supply 	 ing 	 	the	arm	was	 s 	 ever 	 ed 	 	,	was	cut	,	by	say	,	a	 motor 	 cycle 	 	accident	.
so	the	patient	had	an	actual	arm	,	which	is	 pain 	 ful 	 	,	in	a	 s 	 ling 	 	for	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	or	a	year	,	and	then	,	in	a	 mis 	 guide 	 d 	 	attempt	to	get	rid	of	the	pain	in	the	arm	,	the	surgeon	 amput 	 ates 	 	the	arm	,	and	then	you	get	a	phantom	arm	with	the	same	 pain 	 s 	 	,	right	?
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	serious	 clinic 	 al 	 	problem	.
 patient 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 depress 	 ed 	 	.
some	of	them	are	driven	to	 su 	 icide 	 	,	ok	?
so	,	how	do	you	treat	 th 	 is 	 	syndrome	?
now	,	why	do	you	get	a	 paralyze 	 d 	 	phantom	limb	?
when	i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	case	sheet	,	i	found	that	they	had	an	actual	arm	,	and	the	 nerve 	 s 	 	 supply 	 ing 	 	the	arm	had	 be 	 en 	 	cut	,	and	the	actual	arm	had	 be 	 en 	 	 paralyze 	 d 	 	,	and	 ly 	 ing 	 	in	a	 s 	 ling 	 	for	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 month 	 s 	 	before	the	 amput 	 ation 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	pain	then	 get 	 s 	 	carried	over	 in 	 to 	 	the	phantom	 it 	 self 	 	.
why	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	happen	?
when	the	arm	was	 in 	 tact 	 	,	but	 paralyze 	 d 	 	,	the	brain	 s 	 end 	 s 	 	 command 	 s 	 	to	the	arm	,	the	front	of	the	brain	,	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	move	,	``	but	it	's	 get 	 ting 	 	visual	 feed 	 back 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	no.	``	move	.	no	.	move	.	no	.	move	.	no	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 get 	 s 	 	wired	 in 	 to 	 	the	 circuit 	 ry 	 	of	the	brain	,
and	we	call	 th 	 is 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	 para 	 lysis 	 	,	ok	?
the	brain	 learn 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	hebbian	,	 associ 	 ative 	 	link	,	that	the	mere	command	to	move	the	arm	 create 	 s 	 	a	 sens 	 ation 	 	of	a	 paralyze 	 d 	 	arm	.	and	then	,	when	you	've	 amput 	 ated 	 	the	arm	,	 th 	 is 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	 para 	 lysis 	 	 car 	 ries 	 	over	 in 	 to 	 	your	body	image	and	 in 	 to 	 	your	phantom	,	ok	?
now	,	how	do	you	help	these	 patient 	 s 	 	?
how	do	you	 un 	 learn 	 	the	 learn 	 ed 	 	 para 	 lysis 	 	,	so	you	can	 reliev 	 e 	 	him	of	 th 	 is 	 	 excruciat 	 ing 	 	,	 clench 	 ing 	 	 s 	 pa 	 sm 	 	of	the	phantom	arm	?
well	,	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	what	if	you	now	 s 	 end 	 	the	command	to	the	phantom	,	but	give	him	visual	 feed 	 back 	 	that	it	's	 obey 	 ing 	 	his	command	,	right	?
 may 	 be 	 	you	can	 reliev 	 e 	 	the	phantom	pain	,	the	phantom	cramp	.
how	do	you	do	that	?	well	,	virtual	 re 	 ality 	 	.
but	that	 cost 	 s 	 	 million 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
so	,	i	hit	on	a	way	of	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	for	three	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	but	do	n't	tell	my	 fund 	 ing 	 	 age 	 ncies 	 	.
ok	?	what	you	do	is	you	create	what	i	call	a	mirror	box	.
you	have	a	 card 	 board 	 	box	with	a	mirror	in	the	middle	,	and	then	you	put	the	phantom	--	so	my	first	patient	,	derek	,	came	in	.
he	had	his	arm	 amput 	 ated 	 	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
he	had	a	brachial	 avuls 	 ion 	 	,	so	the	 nerve 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	cut	and	the	arm	was	 paralyze 	 d 	 	,	 ly 	 ing 	 	in	a	 s 	 ling 	 	for	a	year	,	and	then	the	arm	was	 amput 	 ated 	 	.
he	had	a	phantom	arm	,	 excruciat 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 pain 	 ful 	 	,	and	he	could	n't	move	it	.
it	was	a	 paralyze 	 d 	 	phantom	arm	.
so	he	came	there	,	and	i	 g 	 ave 	 	him	a	mirror	like	that	,	in	a	box	,	which	i	call	a	mirror	box	,	right	?
and	the	patient	 put 	 s 	 	his	phantom	left	arm	,	which	is	 clench 	 ed 	 	and	in	 s 	 pa 	 sm 	 	,	on	the	left	side	of	the	mirror	,	and	the	normal	hand	on	the	right	side	of	the	mirror	,	and	 make 	 s 	 	the	same	 post 	 ure 	 	,	the	 clench 	 ed 	 	 post 	 ure 	 	,	and	 look 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	the	mirror	.	and	what	 do 	 es 	 	he	experience	?
he	 look 	 s 	 	at	the	phantom	 be 	 ing 	 	 resurrect 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	's	looking	at	the	 reflect 	 ion 	 	of	the	normal	arm	in	the	mirror	,	and	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	phantom	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 resurrect 	 ed 	 	.
``	now	,	``	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	now	,	look	,	 wig 	 gle 	 	your	phantom	--	your	real	 finger 	 s 	 	,	or	move	your	real	 finger 	 s 	 	while	looking	in	the	mirror	.	``	he	's	going	to	get	the	visual	impression	that	the	phantom	is	moving	,	right	?
that	's	obvious	,	but	the	 astonish 	 ing 	 	thing	is	,	the	patient	then	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	oh	my	god	,	my	phantom	is	moving	 aga 	 in 	 	,	and	the	pain	,	the	 clench 	 ing 	 	 s 	 pa 	 sm 	 	,	is	 reliev 	 ed 	 	.	``	and	remember	,	my	first	patient	who	came	in	--	--	thank	you	.
my	first	patient	came	in	,	and	he	 look 	 ed 	 	in	the	mirror	,	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	look	at	your	 reflect 	 ion 	 	of	your	phantom	.	``	and	he	 start 	 ed 	 	 gig 	 gling 	 	,	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	can	see	my	phantom	.	``	but	he	's	not	stupid	.	he	 know 	 s 	 	it	's	not	real	.
he	 know 	 s 	 	it	's	a	mirror	 reflect 	 ion 	 	,	but	it	's	a	 vivi 	 d 	 	 sensor 	 y 	 	experience	.
now	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	move	your	normal	hand	and	phantom	.	``	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	oh	,	i	ca	n't	move	my	phantom	.	you	know	that	.	it	's	 pain 	 ful 	 	.	``	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	move	your	normal	hand	.	``	and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	oh	my	god	,	my	phantom	is	moving	 aga 	 in 	 	.	i	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	!
and	my	pain	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 reliev 	 ed 	 	.	``	ok	?
and	then	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	close	your	 eye 	 s 	 	.	``	he	 close 	 s 	 	his	 eye 	 s 	 	.
``	and	move	your	normal	hand	.	``	``	oh	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	.	it	's	 clench 	 ed 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.	``	``	ok	,	open	your	 eye 	 s 	 	.	``	``	oh	my	god	,	oh	my	god	,	it	's	moving	 aga 	 in 	 	!	``	so	,	he	was	like	a	kid	in	a	 can 	 dy 	 	store	.
so	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	ok	,	 th 	 is 	 	 prove 	 s 	 	my	 theor 	 y 	 	about	 learn 	 ed 	 	 para 	 lysis 	 
and	the	critical	role	of	visual	 in 	 put 	 	,
but	i	'm	not	going	to	get	a	 no 	 bel 	 	prize	for	 get 	 ting 	 	 some 	 body 	 	to	move	his	phantom	limb	.
it	's	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	 use 	 less 	 	ability	,	if	you	think	about	it	.
but	then	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 real 	 izing 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	other	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 para 	 lysis 	 	that	you	see	in	 neuro 	 logy 	 	,	like	stroke	,	 f 	 oc 	 al 	 	 dystonia 	 s 	 	--	there	may	be	a	 learn 	 ed 	 	component	to	 th 	 is 	 	,	which	you	can	 over 	 come 	 	with	the	simple	 de 	 vice 	 	of	using	a	mirror	.
so	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	look	,	derek	``	--	well	,	first	of	all	,	the	guy	ca	n't	just	go	around	 carry 	 ing 	 	a	mirror	to	 allevi 	 ate 	 	his	pain	--	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	look	,	derek	,	take	it	home	and	practice	with	it	for	a	week	or	two	.
 may 	 be 	 	,	after	a	period	of	practice	,	you	can	 dispens 	 e 	 	with	the	mirror	,	 un 	 learn 	 	the	 para 	 lysis 	 	,	and	start	moving	your	 paralyze 	 d 	 	arm	,	and	then	,	 reliev 	 e 	 	 your 	 self 	 	of	pain	.	``	so	he	 s 	 aid 	 	ok	,	and	he	took	it	home	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	look	,	it	's	,	after	all	,	two	 dollar 	 s 	 	.	take	it	home	.	``	so	,	he	took	it	home	,	and	after	two	 week 	 s 	 	,	he	 phone 	 s 	 	me	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	doctor	,	you	're	not	going	to	 believ 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.	``	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	?	``	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	it	's	gone	.	``	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	's	gone	?	``	i	thought	 may 	 be 	 	the	mirror	box	was	gone	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	no	,	no	,	you	know	 th 	 is 	 	phantom	i	've	had	for	the	last	10	 year 	 s 	 	?
it	's	 disappear 	 ed 	 	.	``	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	--	i	got	 worri 	 ed 	 	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	my	god	,	i	mean	i	've	 change 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	guy	's	body	image	,	what	about	human	 subject 	 s 	 	,	 ethic 	 s 	 	and	all	of	that	?
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	derek	,	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 both 	 er 	 	you	?	``	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	last	three	 day 	 s 	 	,	i	've	not	had	a	phantom	arm	and	 there 	 fore 	 	no	phantom	elbow	pain	,	no	 clench 	 ing 	 	,	no	phantom	 fore 	 arm 	 	pain	,	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 pain 	 s 	 	are	gone	away	.
but	the	problem	is	i	still	have	my	phantom	 finger 	 s 	 	 dan 	 gling 	 	from	the	shoulder	,	and	your	box	 do 	 es 	 	n't	reach	.	``	``	so	,	can	you	change	the	design	and	put	it	on	my	 fore 	 head 	 	,	so	i	can	,	you	know	,	do	 th 	 is 	 	and	eliminate	my	phantom	 finger 	 s 	 	?	``	he	thought	i	was	some	kind	of	 magic 	 ian 	 	.
now	,	why	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	happen	?
it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	the	brain	is	 face 	 d 	 	with	tremendous	 sensor 	 y 	 	conflict	.
it	's	 get 	 ting 	 	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	from	vision	 say 	 ing 	 	the	phantom	is	back	.
on	the	other	hand	,	there	's	no	appropriate	 re 	 ception 	 	,	muscle	 signal 	 s 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	that	there	is	no	arm	,	right	?
and	your	motor	command	 say 	 ing 	 	there	is	an	arm	,	and	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	conflict	,	the	brain	 say 	 s 	 	,	to	hell	with	it	,	there	is	no	phantom	,	there	is	no	arm	,	right	?
it	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	sort	of	 deni 	 al 	 	--	 neg 	 ates 	 	the	 signal 	 s 	 	.
and	when	the	arm	 disappear 	 s 	 	,	the	 bon 	 us 	 	is	,	the	pain	 disappear 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	you	ca	n't	have	 dis 	 embodi 	 ed 	 	pain	 float 	 ing 	 	out	there	,	in	space	.
so	,	that	's	the	 bon 	 us 	 	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	 techni 	 que 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 tri 	 ed 	 	on	 dozen 	 s 	 	of	 patient 	 s 	 	by	other	 group 	 s 	 	in	helsinki	,	so	it	may	prove	to	be	 valu 	 able 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 treat 	 ment 	 	for	phantom	pain	,	and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	people	have	 tri 	 ed 	 	it	for	stroke	 rehabilit 	 ation 	 	.
stroke	you	 normal 	 ly 	 	think	of	 a 	 s 	 	damage	to	the	 fiber 	 s 	 	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	you	can	do	about	it	.
but	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	some	component	of	stroke	 para 	 lysis 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	 para 	 lysis 	 	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	that	component	can	be	 over 	 come 	 	using	 mirror 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	gone	through	 clinic 	 al 	 	 trial 	 s 	 	,	 help 	 ing 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 patient 	 s 	 	.
ok	,	let	me	 s 	 witch 	 	 gear 	 s 	 	now	to	the	third	part	of	my	talk	,	which	is	about	 an 	 other 	 	 cur 	 ious 	 	 phenomen 	 on 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 synest 	 hesia 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	 discover 	 ed 	 	by	francis	galton	in	the	 nine 	 teen 	 th 	 	century	.
he	was	a	cousin	of	charles	darwin	.
he	 point 	 ed 	 	out	that	certain	people	in	the	population	,	who	are	 other 	 wise 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	normal	,	had	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	 peculiar 	 ity 	 	:	every	time	they	see	a	number	,	it	's	 color 	 ed 	 	.
five	is	blue	,	seven	is	yellow	,	eight	is	 chart 	 re 	 use 	 	,	nine	is	 indi 	 go 	 	,	ok	?
bear	in	mind	,	these	people	are	 complete 	 ly 	 	normal	in	other	 respect 	 s 	 	.
or	c	sharp	--	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	 tone 	 s 	 	evoke	color	.
c	sharp	is	blue	,	f	sharp	is	green	,	 an 	 other 	 	tone	might	be	yellow	,	right	?
why	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	happen	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	 synest 	 hesia 	 	.	galton	 call 	 ed 	 	it	 synest 	 hesia 	 	,	a	 ming 	 ling 	 	of	the	 sense 	 s 	 	.
in	us	,	all	the	 sense 	 s 	 	are	distinct	.
these	people	muddle	up	 the 	 ir 	 	 sense 	 s 	 	.
why	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	happen	?
one	of	the	two	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	problem	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 intrigu 	 ing 	 	.
 synest 	 hesia 	 	 run 	 s 	 	in	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	,	so	galton	 s 	 aid 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 her 	 edit 	 ary 	 	 bas 	 is 	 	,	a	genetic	 bas 	 is 	 	.
 second 	 ly 	 	,	 synest 	 hesia 	 	is	about	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 get 	 s 	 	me	to	my	point	about	the	main	theme	of	 th 	 is 	 	 lectur 	 e 	 	,	which	is	about	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	--	 synest 	 hesia 	 	is	eight	 time 	 s 	 	more	common	among	 artist 	 s 	 	,	 poet 	 s 	 	,	 novel 	 ists 	 	and	other	creative	people	than	in	the	general	population	.
why	would	that	be	?
i	'm	going	to	answer	that	question	.
it	's	never	 be 	 en 	 	 answer 	 ed 	 	before	.
ok	,	what	is	 synest 	 hesia 	 	?	what	 cause 	 s 	 	it	?
well	,	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 the 	 ories 	 	.
one	 theor 	 y 	 	is	they	're	just	crazy	.
now	,	that	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	a	scientific	 theor 	 y 	 	,	so	we	can	forget	about	it	.
 an 	 other 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	is	they	are	acid	 junk 	 ies 	 	and	 pot 	 head 	 s 	 	,	right	?
now	,	there	may	be	some	truth	to	 th 	 is 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	much	more	common	here	in	the	 ba 	 y 	 	area	than	in	san	diego	.
ok	.	now	,	the	third	 theor 	 y 	 	is	that	--	well	,	let	's	ask	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	going	on	in	 synest 	 hesia 	 	.	all	right	?
so	,	we	found	that	the	color	area	and	the	number	area	are	right	next	to	each	other	in	the	brain	,	in	the	 f 	 usi 	 form 	 	 gy 	 rus 	 	.
so	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	there	's	some	 accident 	 al 	 	cross	wiring	between	color	and	 number 	 s 	 	in	the	brain	.
so	,	every	time	you	see	a	number	,	you	see	a	 correspond 	 ing 	 	color	,	and	that	's	why	you	get	 synest 	 hesia 	 	.
now	remember	--	why	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	happen	?
why	would	there	be	 cross 	 ed 	 	 wire 	 s 	 	in	some	people	?
remember	i	 s 	 aid 	 	it	 run 	 s 	 	in	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	?
that	 give 	 s 	 	you	the	clue	.	and	that	is	,	there	is	an	 ab 	 normal 	 	gene	,	a	mutation	in	the	gene	that	 cause 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 ab 	 normal 	 	cross	wiring	.
in	all	of	us	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	we	are	born	with	 every 	 thing 	 	wired	to	 every 	 thing 	 	else	.
so	,	every	brain	region	is	wired	to	every	other	region	,	and	these	are	 trim 	 med 	 	down	to	create	the	 character 	 istic 	 	modular	 architect 	 ure 	 	of	the	adult	brain	.
so	,	if	there	's	a	gene	 caus 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 trim 	 ming 	 	and	if	that	gene	 mut 	 ates 	 	,	then	you	get	 defici 	 ent 	 	 trim 	 ming 	 	between	 ad 	 ja 	 cent 	 	brain	 area 	 s 	 	.	and	if	it	's	between	number	and	color	,	you	get	number	-	color	 synest 	 hesia 	 	.
if	it	's	between	tone	and	color	,	you	get	tone	-	color	 synest 	 hesia 	 	.
so	far	,	so	good	.
now	,	what	if	 th 	 is 	 	gene	is	 express 	 ed 	 	 every 	 where 	 	in	the	brain	,	so	 every 	 thing 	 	is	cross	-	 connect 	 ed 	 	?
well	,	think	about	what	 artist 	 s 	 	,	 novel 	 ists 	 	and	 poet 	 s 	 	have	in	common	,	the	ability	to	engage	in	 metaphor 	 ical 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	,	 link 	 ing 	 	 seem 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 un 	 related 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	,	``	it	is	the	east	,	and	juliet	is	the	sun.	``	well	,	you	do	n't	say	,	juliet	is	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	she	's	a	 glow 	 ing 	 	ball	of	fire	?
i	mean	,	 schizophrenic 	 s 	 	do	that	,	but	it	's	a	different	story	,	right	?
normal	people	say	,	she	's	warm	like	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	she	's	 radi 	 ant 	 	like	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	she	's	 nurtur 	 ing 	 	like	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
 instant 	 ly 	 	,	you	've	found	the	 link 	 s 	 	.
now	,	if	you	 assum 	 e 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	 great 	 er 	 	cross	wiring	and	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 so 	 	in	different	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	brain	,	then	it	's	going	to	create	a	 great 	 er 	 	 prop 	 en 	 s 	 ity 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 metaphor 	 ical 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	and	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	in	people	with	 synest 	 hesia 	 	.
and	,	 h 	 ence 	 	,	the	eight	 time 	 s 	 	more	common	incidence	of	 synest 	 hesia 	 	among	 poet 	 s 	 	,	 artist 	 s 	 	and	 novel 	 ists 	 	.
ok	,	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 phreno 	 logical 	 	view	of	 synest 	 hesia 	 	.
the	last	 demonst 	 ration 	 	--	can	i	take	one	minute	?
ok	.	i	'm	going	to	show	you	that	you	're	all	 synest 	 het 	 es 	 	,	but	you	're	in	 deni 	 al 	 	about	it	.
here	's	what	i	call	martian	 alpha 	 bet 	 	.	just	like	your	 alpha 	 bet 	 	,	a	is	a	,	b	is	b	,	c	is	c.	different	 shape 	 s 	 	for	different	 phone 	 me 	 s 	 	,	right	?
here	,	you	've	got	martian	 alpha 	 bet 	 	.
one	of	them	is	kiki	,	one	of	them	is	buba	.
which	one	is	kiki	and	which	one	is	buba	?
how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	think	that	's	kiki	and	that	's	buba	?	raise	your	 hand 	 s 	 	.
well	,	it	's	one	or	two	 mut 	 ants 	 	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	think	that	's	buba	,	that	's	kiki	?	raise	your	 hand 	 s 	 	.
ninety	-	nine	percent	of	you	.
now	,	 non 	 e 	 	of	you	is	a	martian	.	how	did	you	do	that	?
it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	all	 do 	 ing 	 	a	cross	-	model	 synest 	 hetic 	 	 abstract 	 ion 	 	,	meaning	you	're	 say 	 ing 	 	that	that	sharp	 inf 	 le 	 ction 	 	--	ki	-	ki	,	in	your	 audit 	 ory 	 	cortex	,	the	hair	 cell 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	--	kiki	,	 mimic 	 s 	 	the	visual	 inf 	 le 	 ction 	 	,	sudden	 inf 	 le 	 ction 	 	of	that	 jagg 	 ed 	 	shape	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	what	it	's	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	is	your	brain	is	 engag 	 ing 	 	in	a	primitive	--	it	's	just	--	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	 s 	 il 	 ly 	 	illusion	,	but	these	 photo 	 ns 	 	in	your	eye	are	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	shape	,	and	hair	 cell 	 s 	 	in	your	ear	are	 excit 	 ing 	 	the	 audit 	 ory 	 	pattern	,	but	the	brain	is	able	to	 ex 	 tract 	 	the	common	 denomi 	 nator 	 	.
it	's	a	primitive	form	of	 abstract 	 ion 	 	,	and	we	now	know	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	in	the	 f 	 usi 	 form 	 	 gy 	 rus 	 	of	the	brain	,	 be 	 cause 	 	when	that	's	 damage 	 d 	 	,	these	people	lose	the	ability	to	engage	in	buba	kiki	,	but	they	 al 	 so 	 	lose	the	ability	to	engage	in	metaphor	.
if	you	ask	 th 	 is 	 	guy	,	what	--	``	all	that	 g 	 litter 	 s 	 	is	not	gold	,	``	what	 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	?	``	the	patient	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	well	,	if	it	's	 metal 	 lic 	 	and	 shin 	 y 	 	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	it	's	gold	.	you	have	to	measure	 it 	 s 	 	specific	 gravit 	 y 	 	,	ok	?	``
so	,	they	 complete 	 ly 	 	 mis 	 s 	 	the	 metaphor 	 ical 	 	meaning	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	area	is	about	eight	 time 	 s 	 	the	 s 	 ize 	 	in	 high 	 er 	 	--	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	in	 human 	 s 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	in	lower	 prim 	 ates 	 	.
 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	going	on	here	in	the	angular	 gy 	 rus 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	the	 cross 	 road 	 s 	 	between	 hear 	 ing 	 	,	vision	and	touch	,	and	it	 be 	 came 	 	enormous	in	 human 	 s 	 	.	and	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	going	on	.
and	i	think	it	's	a	 bas 	 is 	 	of	 man 	 y 	 	 un 	 ique 	 ly 	 	human	abilities	like	 abstract 	 ion 	 	,	metaphor	and	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	.
all	of	these	 question 	 s 	 	that	 philosoph 	 ers 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	for	millennia	,	we	 scientist 	 s 	 	can	begin	to	explore	by	 do 	 ing 	 	brain	 im 	 aging 	 	,	and	by	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	 patient 	 s 	 	and	 ask 	 ing 	 	the	right	 question 	 s 	 	.
thank	you	.
