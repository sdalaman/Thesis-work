early	 vision 	 s 	 	of	 wire 	 less 	 	power	 actual 	 ly 	 	 we 	 re 	 	thought	of	by	nikola	tesla	 bas 	 ically 	 	about	100	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
the	thought	that	you	would	n't	want	to	transfer	electric	power	 wire 	 lessly 	 	,	no	one	ever	thought	of	that	.
they	thought	,	``	who	would	use	it	if	you	did	n't	?	``
and	so	,	in	fact	,	he	 actual 	 ly 	 	set	about	 do 	 ing 	 	a	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
built	the	tesla	coil	.	 th 	 is 	 	tower	was	built	on	long	 is 	 land 	 	back	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	1900s	.
and	the	idea	was	,	it	was	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	able	to	transfer	power	 any 	 where 	 	on	earth	.
we	'll	never	know	if	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	 work 	 ed 	 	.	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	think	the	federal	bureau	of	investigation	took	it	down	for	security	 purpose 	 s 	 	,	 some 	 time 	 	in	the	early	1900s	.
but	the	one	thing	that	did	come	out	of	 electric 	 ity 	 	is	that	we	love	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	so	much	.
if	you	just	walk	 out 	 side 	 	,	there	are	 trillion 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	 invest 	 ed 	 	in	 infra 	 structure 	 	around	the	world	,	 put 	 ting 	 	up	 wire 	 s 	 	to	get	power	from	where	it	's	 create 	 d 	 	to	where	it	's	used	.
the	other	thing	is	,	we	love	 batt 	 eries 	 	.
and	for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	us	that	have	an	 environment 	 al 	 	element	to	us	,	there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	like	40	billion	 dispos 	 able 	 	 batt 	 eries 	 	built	every	year
for	power	that	,	 general 	 ly 	 	 s 	 peaking 	 	,	is	used	 with 	 in 	 	a	few	 inch 	 es 	 	or	a	few	feet	of	where	there	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 in 	 expensive 	 	power	.
so	,	before	i	got	here	,	i	thought	,	``	you	know	,	i	am	from	north	america	.
we	do	have	a	little	bit	of	a	reputation	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.	``
so	i	thought	i	'd	better	look	it	up	first	.
so	definition	number	six	is	the	north	american	definition	of	the	word	``	suck	.	``
 wire 	 s 	 	suck	,	they	 re 	 ally 	 	do	.
think	about	it	.	 whet 	 her 	 	that	's	you	in	that	picture	or	 some 	 thing 	 	under	your	desk	.
the	other	thing	is	,	 batt 	 eries 	 	suck	too	.
and	they	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	do	.
do	you	ever	wonder	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	?
40	billion	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	built	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 happen 	 s 	 	.
they	fall	 a 	 part 	 	,	they	 dis 	 integrate 	 	,	and	they	end	up	here	.
so	when	you	talk	about	expensive	power	,	the	cost	per	kilowatt	-	hour	to	supply	 batt 	 ery 	 	power	to	 some 	 thing 	 	is	on	the	order	of	two	to	three	hundred	 pound 	 s 	 	.
think	about	that	.
the	most	expensive	grid	power	in	the	world	is	 thousand 	 th 	 s 	 	of	that	.
so	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	one	of	the	other	 definition 	 s 	 	of	``	suck	``	that	was	in	there	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	create	a	vacuum	.
and	nature	 re 	 ally 	 	 do 	 es 	 	abhor	a	vacuum	.
what	 happen 	 ed 	 	back	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	was	a	group	of	 theoretic 	 al 	 	 physicist 	 s 	 	at	mit	 actual 	 ly 	 	came	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 cept 	 	of	 transfer 	 ring 	 	power	over	distance	.
 bas 	 ically 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	light	a	60	watt	light	bulb	at	a	distance	of	about	two	 meter 	 s 	 	.
it	got	about	50	percent	of	the	efficiency	--
by	the	way	,	that	's	still	a	couple	thousand	 time 	 s 	 	more	efficient	than	a	 batt 	 ery 	 	would	be	,	to	do	the	same	thing	.
but	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	light	that	,	and	do	it	 ver 	 y 	 	 success 	 fully 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	experiment	.	so	you	can	see	the	 coil 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 some 	 what 	 	 large 	 r 	 	.
the	light	bulb	was	a	 fair 	 ly 	 	simple	task	,	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 stand 	 point 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	all	came	from	a	professor	 wa 	 king 	 	up	at	night	to	the	third	night	in	a	row	that	his	wife	's	 cell 	 phone 	 	was	 beep 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	running	out	of	 batt 	 ery 	 	power	.
and	he	was	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	with	all	the	 electric 	 ity 	 	that	's	out	there	in	the	 wall 	 s 	 	,	why	could	n't	some	of	that	just	come	 in 	 to 	 	the	phone	so	i	could	get	some	sleep	?	``
and	he	 actual 	 ly 	 	came	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 cept 	 	of	 reson 	 ant 	 	energy	transfer	.
but	 in 	 side 	 	a	standard	 transform 	 er 	 	are	two	 coil 	 s 	 	of	wire	.	and	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 coil 	 s 	 	of	wire	are	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	close	to	each	other	,	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	transfer	power	 magnet 	 ically 	 	and	 wire 	 lessly 	 	,	 on 	 ly 	 	over	a	 ver 	 y 	 	short	distance	.
what	dr.	soljacic	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	how	to	do	was	 separat 	 e 	 	the	 coil 	 s 	 	in	a	 transform 	 er 	 	to	a	 great 	 er 	 	distance	than	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 transform 	 ers 	 	using	 th 	 is 	 	technology	,	which	is	not	 dis 	 similar 	 	from	the	way	an	opera	 s 	 ing 	 er 	 	 shatter 	 s 	 	a	glass	on	the	other	side	of	the	room	.
it	's	a	 reson 	 ant 	 	 phenomen 	 on 	 	for	which	he	 actual 	 ly 	 	 receiv 	 ed 	 	a	macarthur	 fellow 	 ship 	 	 a 	 ward 	 	,	which	is	 nick 	 named 	 	the	 gen 	 ius 	 	 a 	 ward 	 	,	last	september	,	for	his	 discover 	 y 	 	.
so	how	 do 	 es 	 	it	work	?
imagine	a	coil	.	for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	that	are	 engineer 	 s 	 	,	there	's	a	 cap 	 acitor 	 	 attach 	 ed 	 	to	it	too	.
and	if	you	can	cause	that	coil	to	 reson 	 ate 	 	,	what	will	happen	is	it	will	 puls 	 e 	 	at	 alter 	 nating 	 	current	 fr 	 equ 	 encies 	 	--	at	a	 fair 	 ly 	 	high	frequency	,	by	the	way	.
and	if	you	can	 br 	 ing 	 	 an 	 other 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	close	 en 	 ough 	 	to	the	source	,	that	will	 on 	 ly 	 	work	at	 exact 	 ly 	 	that	frequency	,	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	them	to	do	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	 strong 	 ly 	 	couple	,	and	transfer	 magnet 	 ic 	 	energy	between	them	.
and	then	what	you	do	is	,	you	start	out	with	 electric 	 ity 	 	,	turn	it	 in 	 to 	 	 magnet 	 ic 	 	field	,	take	that	 magnet 	 ic 	 	field	,	turn	it	back	 in 	 to 	 	 electric 	 ity 	 	,	and	then	you	can	use	it	.
number	one	question	i	get	 ask 	 ed 	 	.	i	mean	,	people	are	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	 cell 	 phone 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	safe	.
you	know	.	what	about	 safe 	 ty 	 	?
the	first	thing	is	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	``	 radi 	 ative 	 	``	technology	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	radiate	.
there	are	n't	electric	 field 	 s 	 	here	.	it	's	a	 magnet 	 ic 	 	field	.
it	 stay 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	either	what	we	call	the	source	,	or	 with 	 in 	 	the	 de 	 vice 	 	.
and	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	the	 magnet 	 ic 	 	 field 	 s 	 	we	're	using	are	 bas 	 ically 	 	about	the	same	 a 	 s 	 	the	earth	's	 magnet 	 ic 	 	field	.
we	live	in	a	 magnet 	 ic 	 	field	.
and	the	other	thing	that	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	cool	about	the	technology	is	that	it	 on 	 ly 	 	 transfer 	 s 	 	energy	to	 thing 	 s 	 	that	work	at	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	frequency	.
and	it	's	 virtual 	 ly 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	in	nature	to	make	that	happen	.
then	 final 	 ly 	 	we	have	 government 	 al 	 	bodies	 every 	 where 	 	that	will	 regulat 	 e 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	we	do	.
they	've	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	set	field	 expo 	 s 	 ure 	 	 limit 	 s 	 	,	which	all	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	in	the	stuff	i	'll	show	you	 to 	 day 	 	mobile	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	.
home	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	 cord 	 s 	 	under	your	desk	,	i	bet	 every 	 body 	 	here	 ha 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 look 	 s 	 	like	that	or	 t 	 hose 	 	 batt 	 eries 	 	.
there	are	industrial	 application 	 s 	 	.
and	then	 final 	 ly 	 	,	electric	 vehicle 	 s 	 	.
these	electric	 car 	 s 	 	are	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
but	who	is	going	to	want	to	plug	them	in	?
imagine	 driv 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	your	 gar 	 age 	 	--	we	've	built	a	system	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	--	you	drive	 in 	 to 	 	your	 gar 	 age 	 	,	and	the	car	 charge 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	,
 be 	 cause 	 	there	is	a	mat	on	the	floor	that	's	 plug 	 ged 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	wall	.
and	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 cause 	 s 	 	your	car	to	charge	 safe 	 ly 	 	and	 efficient 	 ly 	 	.
then	there	's	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	other	 application 	 s 	 	.	 implant 	 ed 	 	medical	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	,
where	people	do	n't	have	to	die	of	 infect 	 ions 	 	 any 	 more 	 	if	you	can	seal	the	thing	up	.
credit	 card 	 s 	 	,	robot	vacuum	 clean 	 ers 	 	.
so	what	i	'd	like	to	do	is	take	a	couple	 minute 	 s 	 	and	show	you	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	how	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
and	what	i	'm	going	to	do	is	to	show	you	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	what	's	here	.
you	've	got	a	coil	.	that	coil	is	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	an	r.f	.	 ampl 	 ifier 	 	that	 create 	 s 	 	a	high	-	frequency	 oscill 	 ating 	 	 magnet 	 ic 	 	field	.
we	put	one	on	the	back	of	the	 tele 	 vision 	 	set	.
by	the	way	,	i	do	make	it	look	a	little	bit	 eas 	 ier 	 	than	it	is	.
there	's	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	and	secret	sauce	and	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	intellectual	 proper 	 ty 	 	that	go	 in 	 to 	 	it	.
but	then	what	's	going	to	happen	is	,	it	will	create	a	field	.	it	will	cause	one	to	get	 create 	 d 	 	on	the	other	side	.
and	if	the	demo	 god 	 s 	 	are	 will 	 ing 	 	,	in	about	10	 second 	 s 	 	or	so	we	should	see	it	.
the	10	 second 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	are	 be 	 cause 	 	we	--
i	do	n't	know	if	any	of	you	have	ever	thought	about	 plug 	 ging 	 	a	t.v	.	in	when	you	use	just	a	cord	.
 general 	 ly 	 	,	you	have	to	go	over	and	hit	the	button	.	so	i	thought	we	put	a	little	computer	in	it	that	 ha 	 s 	 	to	wake	up	to	tell	it	to	do	that	.
so	,	i	'll	plug	that	in	.
it	 create 	 s 	 	a	 magnet 	 ic 	 	field	here	.
it	 cause 	 s 	 	one	to	be	 create 	 d 	 	out	here	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	in	sort	of	about	10	 second 	 s 	 	we	should	start	to	see	...
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 commercial 	 ly 	 	--	 avail 	 able 	 	color	 tele 	 vision 	 	set	.
imagine	,	you	get	one	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.	you	want	to	hang	them	on	the	wall	.
how	 man 	 y 	 	people	want	to	hang	them	on	the	wall	?
think	about	it	.	you	do	n't	want	 t 	 hose 	 	 ug 	 ly 	 	 cord 	 s 	 	coming	down	.
imagine	if	you	can	get	rid	of	it	.
the	other	thing	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	talk	about	was	 safe 	 ty 	 	.
so	,	there	is	 noth 	 ing 	 	going	on	.	i	'm	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
and	i	'll	do	it	 aga 	 in 	 	,	just	for	 safe 	 ty 	 	's	sake	.
 al 	 most 	 	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	people	ask	,	``	how	small	can	you	make	 th 	 is 	 	?	can	you	make	 th 	 is 	 	small	 en 	 ough 	 	?	``
 be 	 cause 	 	remember	dr.	soljacic	's	original	idea	was	his	wife	's	 cell 	 phone 	 	 beep 	 ing 	 	.
so	,	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	show	you	 some 	 thing 	 	.
we	're	an	equal	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	 design 	 er 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	thing	.
 th 	 is 	 	a	google	g	1	.
you	know	,	it	's	the	 lat 	 est 	 	thing	that	's	come	out	.
it	 run 	 s 	 	the	android	 oper 	 ating 	 	system	.
i	think	i	heard	 some 	 body 	 	talk	about	that	before	.
it	's	odd	.	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 batt 	 ery 	 	.
it	 al 	 so 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 coil 	 ed 	 	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	that	witricity	 ha 	 s 	 	put	 in 	 to 	 	the	back	of	it	.
and	if	i	can	get	the	camera	--	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	great	--	you	'll	see	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	get	sort	of	close	...	you	're	looking	at	a	 cell 	 phone 	 	powered	 complete 	 ly 	 	 wire 	 lessly 	 	.
and	i	know	some	of	you	are	apple	 aficionado 	 s 	 	.
so	,	you	know	they	do	n't	make	it	easy	at	apple	to	get	 in 	 side 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 phone 	 s 	 	.
so	we	put	a	little	sleeve	on	the	back	,
but	we	should	be	able	to	get	 th 	 is 	 	guy	to	wake	up	too	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	that	have	an	iphone	 recogn 	 ize 	 	the	green	center	.
and	nokia	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
you	'll	see	that	what	we	did	there	is	put	a	little	thing	in	the	back	,	to	do	that	,	and	it	 prob 	 ably 	 	 beep 	 s 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 go 	 es 	 	on	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
but	they	 typical 	 ly 	 	use	it	to	light	up	the	screen	.
so	,	imagine	these	 thing 	 s 	 	could	go	...	they	could	go	in	your	 ceil 	 ing 	 	.
they	could	go	in	the	floor	.	they	could	go	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 under 	 neath 	 	your	 desk 	 top 	 	.
so	that	when	you	walk	in	or	you	come	in	from	home	,	if	you	carry	a	 pur 	 s 	 e 	 	,	it	 work 	 s 	 	in	your	 pur 	 s 	 e 	 	.
you	never	have	to	worry	about	 plug 	 ging 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	in	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	think	of	what	that	would	do	for	you	.
so	i	think	in	 clo 	 s 	 ing 	 	,	sort	of	in	the	 im 	 mortal 	 	 vision 	 s 	 	of	the	new	yorker	magazine	,	i	thought	i	'd	put	up	one	more	slide	.
and	for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	ca	n't	read	it	,	it	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	it	 do 	 es 	 	appear	to	be	some	kind	of	 wire 	 less 	 	technology	.	``
so	,	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
