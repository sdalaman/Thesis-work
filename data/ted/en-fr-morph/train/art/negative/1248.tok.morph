i	'd	like	to	take	you	to	 an 	 other 	 	world	.
and	i	'd	like	to	share	a	45	year	-	old	love	story	with	the	poor	,	living	on	less	than	one	dollar	a	day	.
i	went	to	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 e 	 lit 	 ist 	 	,	 snob 	 b 	 ish 	 	,	expensive	education	in	india	,	and	that	 al 	 most 	 	 destroy 	 ed 	 	me	.
i	was	all	set	to	be	a	diplomat	,	teacher	,	doctor	--	all	laid	out	.
then	,	i	do	n't	look	it	,	but	i	was	the	indian	national	squash	champion	for	three	 year 	 s 	 	.
the	whole	world	was	laid	out	for	me	.
 every 	 thing 	 	was	at	my	feet	.
i	could	do	 noth 	 ing 	 	wrong	.
and	then	i	thought	out	of	curiosity	i	'd	like	to	go	and	live	and	work	and	just	see	what	a	village	is	like	.
so	in	1965	,	i	went	to	what	was	 call 	 ed 	 	the	worst	bihar	famine	in	india	,	and	i	saw	 starv 	 ation 	 	,	death	,	people	 dy 	 ing 	 	of	 hung 	 er 	 	,	for	the	first	time	.
it	 change 	 d 	 	my	life	.
i	came	back	home	,	told	my	mother	,	``	i	'd	like	to	live	and	work	in	a	village	.	``
mother	went	 in 	 to 	 	a	 com 	 a 	 	.
``	what	is	 th 	 is 	 	?
the	whole	world	is	laid	out	for	you	,	the	best	 job 	 s 	 	are	laid	out	for	you	,	and	you	want	to	go	and	work	in	a	village	?
i	mean	,	is	there	 some 	 thing 	 	wrong	with	you	?	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	i	've	got	the	best	eduction	.
it	made	me	think	.
and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	give	 some 	 thing 	 	back	in	my	own	way	.	``
``	what	do	you	want	to	do	in	a	village	?
no	job	,	no	money	,	no	security	,	no	prospect	.	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	want	to	live	and	dig	 well 	 s 	 	for	five	 year 	 s 	 	.	``
``	dig	 well 	 s 	 	for	five	 year 	 s 	 	?
you	went	to	the	most	expensive	school	and	college	in	india	,	and	you	want	to	dig	 well 	 s 	 	for	five	 year 	 s 	 	?	``
she	did	n't	speak	to	me	for	a	 ver 	 y 	 	long	time	,	 be 	 cause 	 	she	thought	i	'd	let	my	family	down	.
but	then	,	i	was	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	to	the	most	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	knowledge	and	 skill 	 s 	 	that	 ver 	 y 	 	poor	people	have	,	which	are	never	 br 	 ought 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 main 	 stream 	 	--	which	is	never	identified	,	 respect 	 ed 	 	,	 appli 	 ed 	 	on	a	large	scale	.
and	i	thought	i	'd	start	a	 bare 	 foot 	 	college	--	college	 on 	 ly 	 	for	the	poor	.
what	the	poor	thought	was	 import 	 ant 	 	would	be	 reflect 	 ed 	 	in	the	college	.
i	went	to	 th 	 is 	 	village	for	the	first	time	.
 elder 	 s 	 	came	to	me	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	are	you	running	from	the	police	?	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no.	``
``	you	 fail 	 ed 	 	in	your	 ex 	 am 	 	?	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no.	``
``	you	did	n't	get	a	government	job	?	``	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no.	``
``	what	are	you	 do 	 ing 	 	here	?
why	are	you	here	?
the	education	system	in	india	 make 	 s 	 	you	look	at	paris	and	new	delhi	and	zurich	;	what	are	you	 do 	 ing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	village	?
is	there	 some 	 thing 	 	wrong	with	you	you	're	not	 tell 	 ing 	 	us	?	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	i	want	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	start	a	college	 on 	 ly 	 	for	the	poor	.
what	the	poor	thought	was	 import 	 ant 	 	would	be	 reflect 	 ed 	 	in	the	college	.	``
so	the	 elder 	 s 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	me	some	 ver 	 y 	 	sound	and	 pro 	 found 	 	 ad 	 vice 	 	.
they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 pleas 	 e 	 	,	do	n't	 br 	 ing 	 	 any 	 one 	 	with	a	degree	and	 qual 	 ification 	 	 in 	 to 	 	your	college	.	``
so	it	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	college	in	india	where	,	if	you	should	have	a	ph.d.	or	a	master	's	,	you	are	 dis 	 qual 	 ified 	 	to	come	.
you	have	to	be	a	cop	-	out	or	a	wash	-	out	or	a	 drop 	 out 	 	to	come	to	our	college	.
you	have	to	work	with	your	 hand 	 s 	 	.
you	have	to	have	a	dignity	of	labor	.
you	have	to	show	that	you	have	a	skill	that	you	can	 off 	 er 	 	to	the	community	and	provide	a	service	to	the	community	.
so	we	 start 	 ed 	 	the	 bare 	 foot 	 	college	,	and	we	 re 	 defined 	 	 professional 	 ism 	 	.
who	is	a	professional	?
a	professional	is	 some 	 one 	 	who	 ha 	 s 	 	a	combination	of	 compete 	 nce 	 	,	confidence	and	belief	.
a	water	 divine 	 r 	 	is	a	professional	.
a	 tradition 	 al 	 	 mid 	 wife 	 	is	a	professional	.
a	 tradition 	 al 	 	bone	setter	is	a	professional	.
these	are	 professional 	 s 	 	all	over	the	world	.
you	find	them	in	any	 in 	 access 	 ible 	 	village	around	the	world	.
and	we	thought	that	these	people	should	come	 in 	 to 	 	the	 main 	 stream 	 	and	show	that	the	knowledge	and	 skill 	 s 	 	that	they	have	is	universal	.
it	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	used	,	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 appli 	 ed 	 	,	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 show 	 n 	 	to	the	world	 out 	 side 	 	--	that	these	knowledge	and	 skill 	 s 	 	are	relevant	even	 to 	 day 	 	.
so	the	college	 work 	 s 	 	 follow 	 ing 	 	the	 life 	 style 	 	and	 work 	 style 	 	of	mahatma	gandhi	.
you	eat	on	the	floor	,	you	sleep	on	the	floor	,	you	work	on	the	floor	.
there	are	no	 contract 	 s 	 	,	no	written	 contract 	 s 	 	.
you	can	stay	with	me	for	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	go	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	.
and	no	one	can	get	more	than	$	100	a	month	.
you	come	for	the	money	,	you	do	n't	come	to	 bare 	 foot 	 	college	.
you	come	for	the	work	and	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	,	you	'll	come	to	the	 bare 	 foot 	 	college	.
that	is	where	we	want	you	to	try	crazy	 idea 	 s 	 	.
 what 	 ever 	 	idea	you	have	,	come	and	try	it	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	if	you	fail	.
 batt 	 er 	 ed 	 	,	 bruis 	 ed 	 	,	you	start	 aga 	 in 	 	.
it	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	college	where	the	teacher	is	the	 learn 	 er 	 	and	the	 learn 	 er 	 	is	the	teacher	.
and	it	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	college	where	we	do	n't	give	a	certificate	.
you	are	 cert 	 ified 	 	by	the	community	you	serve	.
you	do	n't	need	a	paper	to	hang	on	the	wall	to	show	that	you	are	an	engineer	.
so	when	i	 s 	 aid 	 	that	,	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	show	us	what	is	possible	.	what	are	you	 do 	 ing 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	all	mumbo	-	jumbo	if	you	ca	n't	show	it	on	the	ground	.	``
so	we	built	the	first	 bare 	 foot 	 	college	in	1986	.
it	was	built	by	12	 bare 	 foot 	 	 architect 	 s 	 	who	ca	n't	read	and	write	,	built	on	$	1.50	a	sq	.	ft.	150	people	lived	there	,	 work 	 ed 	 	there	.
they	got	the	aga	khan	 a 	 ward 	 	for	 architect 	 ure 	 	in	2002	.
but	then	they	 suspect 	 ed 	 	,	they	thought	there	was	an	architect	 be 	 hind 	 	it	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	they	made	the	 blue 	 print 	 s 	 	,	but	the	 bare 	 foot 	 	 architect 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 construct 	 ed 	 	the	college	.	``
we	are	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 one 	 s 	 	who	 actual 	 ly 	 	 return 	 ed 	 	the	 a 	 ward 	 	for	$	50,000	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	did	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	us	,	and	we	thought	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 cast 	 ing 	 	 aspers 	 ions 	 	on	the	 bare 	 foot 	 	 architect 	 s 	 	of	tilonia	.
i	 ask 	 ed 	 	a	 forest 	 er 	 	--	high	-	powered	,	paper	-	 qual 	 ified 	 	expert	--	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	can	you	build	in	 th 	 is 	 	place	?	``
he	had	one	look	at	the	 s 	 oil 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	forget	it	.	no	way	.
not	even	worth	it	.
no	water	,	 rock 	 y 	 	 s 	 oil 	 	.	``
i	was	in	a	bit	of	a	spot	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	i	'll	go	to	the	old	man	in	village	and	say	,	'	what	should	i	grow	in	 th 	 is 	 	spot	?	'	``
he	 look 	 ed 	 	 quiet 	 ly 	 	at	me	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	build	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	build	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	put	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	it	'll	work	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	 to 	 day 	 	.
went	to	the	roof	,	and	all	the	women	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	clear	out	.
the	men	should	clear	out	 be 	 cause 	 	we	do	n't	want	to	share	 th 	 is 	 	technology	with	the	men	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 water 	 proof 	 ing 	 	the	roof	.	``
it	is	a	bit	of	 jagg 	 ery 	 	,	a	bit	of	 ure 	 ns 	 	and	a	bit	of	other	 thing 	 s 	 	i	do	n't	know	.
but	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	leak	.
since	1986	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 leak 	 ed 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	technology	,	the	women	will	not	share	with	the	men	.
it	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	college	which	is	fully	solar	-	 electr 	 ified 	 	.
all	the	power	 come 	 s 	 	from	the	 s 	 un 	 	.
45	 kilowatt 	 s 	 	of	 pan 	 el 	 s 	 	on	the	roof	.
and	 every 	 thing 	 	 work 	 s 	 	off	the	 s 	 un 	 	for	the	next	25	 year 	 s 	 	.
so	long	 a 	 s 	 	the	 s 	 un 	 	 shine 	 s 	 	,	we	'll	have	no	problem	with	power	.
but	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	is	that	is	was	 install 	 ed 	 	by	a	priest	,	a	hindu	priest	,	who	's	 on 	 ly 	 	 d 	 one 	 	eight	 year 	 s 	 	of	 prim 	 ary 	 	 school 	 ing 	 	--	never	 be 	 en 	 	to	school	,	never	 be 	 en 	 	to	college	.
he	 know 	 s 	 	more	about	solar	than	 any 	 one 	 	i	know	 any 	 where 	 	in	the	world	 guarantee 	 d 	 	.
food	,	if	you	come	to	the	 bare 	 foot 	 	college	,	is	solar	 cook 	 ed 	 	.
but	the	people	who	 fabric 	 ated 	 	that	solar	 cook 	 er 	 	are	women	,	illiterate	women	,	who	 actual 	 ly 	 	 fabric 	 ate 	 	the	most	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	solar	 cook 	 er 	 	.
it	's	a	 para 	 bolic 	 	scheffler	solar	 cook 	 er 	 	.
 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	they	're	 al 	 most 	 	half	german	,	they	're	so	precise	.
you	'll	never	find	indian	women	so	precise	.
 absolute 	 ly 	 	to	the	last	inch	,	they	can	make	that	 cook 	 er 	 	.
and	we	have	60	 meal 	 s 	 	twice	a	day	of	solar	 cook 	 ing 	 	.
we	have	a	 dent 	 ist 	 	--	she	's	a	 grand 	 mother 	 	,	illiterate	,	who	's	a	 dent 	 ist 	 	.
she	 actual 	 ly 	 	 look 	 s 	 	after	the	 tee 	 th 	 	of	7,000	children	.
 bare 	 foot 	 	technology	:	 th 	 is 	 	was	1986	--	no	engineer	,	no	architect	thought	of	it	--	but	we	are	 collect 	 ing 	 	 rain 	 water 	 	from	the	 roof 	 s 	 	.
 ver 	 y 	 	little	water	is	 waste 	 d 	 	.
all	the	 roof 	 s 	 	are	 connect 	 ed 	 	 under 	 ground 	 	to	a	400,000	liter	tank	,	and	no	water	is	 waste 	 d 	 	.
if	we	have	four	 year 	 s 	 	of	drought	,	we	still	have	water	on	the	campus	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	collect	 rain 	 water 	 	.
60	percent	of	children	do	n't	go	to	school	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	have	to	look	after	 animal 	 s 	 	--	sheep	,	 goat 	 s 	 	--	domestic	 chore 	 s 	 	.
so	we	thought	of	 start 	 ing 	 	a	school	at	night	for	the	children	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	night	 school 	 s 	 	of	tilonia	,	over	75,000	children	have	gone	through	these	night	 school 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	for	the	convenience	of	the	child	;	it	's	not	for	the	convenience	of	the	teacher	.
and	what	do	we	teach	in	these	 school 	 s 	 	?
 demo 	 cracy 	 	,	 citizen 	 ship 	 	,	how	you	should	measure	your	land	,	what	you	should	do	if	you	're	 arrest 	 ed 	 	,	what	you	should	do	if	your	animal	is	sick	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	teach	in	the	night	 school 	 s 	 	.
but	all	the	 school 	 s 	 	are	solar	-	lit	.
every	five	 year 	 s 	 	we	have	an	election	.
between	six	to	14	year	-	old	children	 particip 	 ate 	 	in	a	 democrat 	 ic 	 	process	,	and	they	elect	a	prime	 mini 	 ster 	 	.
the	prime	 mini 	 ster 	 	is	12	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
she	 look 	 s 	 	after	20	 goat 	 s 	 	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	but	she	's	prime	 mini 	 ster 	 	in	the	 even 	 ing 	 	.
she	 ha 	 s 	 	a	cabinet	,	a	 mini 	 ster 	 	of	education	,	a	 mini 	 ster 	 	for	energy	,	a	 mini 	 ster 	 	for	health	.
and	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	monitor	and	supervise	150	 school 	 s 	 	for	7,000	children	.
she	got	the	world	's	children	's	prize	five	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	she	went	to	sweden	.

never	 s 	 een 	 	sweden	.
was	n't	 dazzl 	 ed 	 	at	all	by	what	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
and	the	 que 	 en 	 	of	sweden	,	who	's	there	,	 turn 	 ed 	 	to	me	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	can	you	ask	 th 	 is 	 	child	where	she	got	her	confidence	from	?
she	's	 on 	 ly 	 	12	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	and	she	's	not	 dazzl 	 ed 	 	by	 any 	 thing 	 	.	``
and	the	girl	,	who	's	on	her	left	,	 turn 	 ed 	 	to	me	and	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	 que 	 en 	 	straight	in	the	eye	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 pleas 	 e 	 	tell	her	i	'm	the	prime	 mini 	 ster 	 	.	``
where	the	 percent 	 age 	 	of	 il 	 liter 	 acy 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	high	,	we	use	 puppet 	 ry 	 	.
 puppet 	 s 	 	is	the	way	we	communicate	.
you	have	jokhim	chacha	who	is	300	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
he	is	my	 psycho 	 analyst 	 	.	he	is	my	teacher	.
he	's	my	doctor	.	he	's	my	lawyer	.

if	there	's	tension	in	the	village	,	if	 attend 	 ance 	 	at	the	 school 	 s 	 	 go 	 es 	 	down	and	there	's	a	friction	between	the	teacher	and	the	parent	,	the	puppet	 call 	 s 	 	the	teacher	and	the	parent	in	front	of	the	whole	village	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	shake	 hand 	 s 	 	.
the	 attend 	 ance 	 	must	not	drop	.	``
these	 puppet 	 s 	 	are	made	out	of	 recycl 	 ed 	 	world	bank	 report 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 central 	 ized 	 	,	 de 	 myst 	 ified 	 	approach	of	solar	-	electrifying	 village 	 s 	 	,	we	've	 cover 	 ed 	 	all	over	india	from	ladakh	up	to	bhutan	--	all	solar	-	 electr 	 ified 	 	 village 	 s 	 	by	people	who	have	 be 	 en 	 	trained	.
and	we	went	to	ladakh	,	and	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	woman	--	 th 	 is 	 	,	at	minus	40	,	you	have	to	come	out	of	the	roof	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	no	place	,	it	was	all	 snow 	 ed 	 	up	on	both	 side 	 s 	 	--	and	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	woman	,	``	what	was	the	benefit	you	had	from	solar	 electric 	 ity 	 	?	``
and	she	thought	for	a	minute	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	it	's	the	first	time	i	can	see	my	husband	's	face	in	winter	.	``
went	to	afghanistan	.
one	 less 	 on 	 	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	in	india	was	men	are	 un 	 train 	 able 	 	.
men	are	 rest 	 less 	 	,	men	are	 ambit 	 ious 	 	,	men	are	 compulsive 	 ly 	 	mobile	,	and	they	all	want	a	certificate	.
all	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 glob 	 e 	 	,	you	have	 th 	 is 	 	 tend 	 ency 	 	of	men	 want 	 ing 	 	a	certificate	.
why	?	 be 	 cause 	 	they	want	to	 leav 	 e 	 	the	village	and	go	to	a	city	,	looking	for	a	job	.
so	we	came	up	with	a	great	solution	:	train	 grand 	 mother 	 s 	 	.
what	's	the	best	way	of	 commun 	 ic 	 ating 	 	in	the	world	 to 	 day 	 	?
 tele 	 vision 	 	?	no	.
 tele 	 graph 	 	?	no	.
 tele 	 phone 	 	?	no	.
tell	a	woman	.
so	we	went	to	afghanistan	for	the	first	time	,	and	we	 pick 	 ed 	 	three	women	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	want	to	take	them	to	india	.	``
they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 im 	 possible 	 	.	they	do	n't	even	go	out	of	 the 	 ir 	 	rooms	,	and	you	want	to	take	them	to	india	.	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	'll	make	a	concession	.	i	'll	take	the	 husband 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.	``
so	i	took	the	 husband 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	.
of	course	,	the	women	 we 	 re 	 	much	more	intelligent	than	the	men	.
in	six	 month 	 s 	 	,	how	do	we	train	these	women	?
sign	language	.
you	do	n't	 choos 	 e 	 	the	written	word	.
you	do	n't	 choos 	 e 	 	the	spoken	word	.
you	use	sign	language	.
and	in	six	 month 	 s 	 	they	can	 be 	 come 	 	solar	 engineer 	 s 	 	.
they	go	back	and	solar	-	 electr 	 ify 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	village	.
 th 	 is 	 	woman	went	back	and	solar	-	 electr 	 ified 	 	the	first	village	,	set	up	a	 work 	 shop 	 	--	the	first	village	ever	to	be	solar	-	 electr 	 ified 	 	in	afghanistan	[	was	]	by	the	three	women	.
 th 	 is 	 	woman	is	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 grand 	 mother 	 	.
55	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	and	she	's	solar	-	 electr 	 ified 	 	200	 house 	 s 	 	for	me	in	afghanistan	.
