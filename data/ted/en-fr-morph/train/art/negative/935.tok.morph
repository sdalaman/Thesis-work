i	was	one	of	the	 found 	 ing 	 	 member 	 s 	 	of	the	axis	of	 e 	 vil 	 	 come 	 dy 	 	tour	.
the	other	 found 	 ing 	 	 member 	 s 	 	 include 	 d 	 	ahmed	ahmed	,	who	is	an	egyptian	-	american	,	who	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	the	idea	to	go	to	the	middle	east	and	try	it	out	.
before	we	went	out	 a 	 s 	 	a	tour	,	he	went	out	 s 	 olo 	 	and	did	it	first	.
then	there	was	aron	kader	,	who	was	the	palestinian	-	american	.
and	then	there	was	me	,	the	iranian	-	american	of	the	group	.
now	,	 be 	 ing 	 	iranian	-	american	 present 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	own	set	of	 problem 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	know	.
 t 	 hose 	 	two	 count 	 ries 	 	are	n't	 get 	 ting 	 	 a 	 long 	 	these	 day 	 s 	 	.
so	it	 cause 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	inner	conflict	,	you	know	,	like	part	of	me	 like 	 s 	 	me	,	part	of	me	 hate 	 s 	 	me	.
part	of	me	 think 	 s 	 	i	should	have	a	nuclear	program	,	the	other	part	 think 	 s 	 	i	ca	n't	be	 trust 	 ed 	 	with	one	.
these	are	 dilemma 	 s 	 	i	have	every	day	.
but	i	was	born	in	iran	;	i	'm	now	an	american	citizen	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	i	have	the	american	 pass 	 port 	 	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	i	can	travel	.
 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	 on 	 ly 	 	have	the	iranian	 pass 	 port 	 	,	you	're	kind	of	 limit 	 ed 	 	to	the	 count 	 ries 	 	you	can	go	to	with	open	 arm 	 s 	 	,	you	know	--	syria	,	venezuela	,	north	korea	.
so	 any 	 one 	 	who	's	gotten	 the 	 ir 	 	 pass 	 port 	 	in	america	will	tell	you	,	when	you	get	your	 pass 	 port 	 	,	it	still	 say 	 s 	 	what	country	you	 we 	 re 	 	born	in	.
so	i	remember	 get 	 ting 	 	my	american	 pass 	 port 	 	.
i	was	like	,	``	woohoo	!	i	'm	going	to	travel	.	``
and	i	 open 	 ed 	 	it	up	,	it	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	born	in	iran	.	``	i	'm	like	,	``	oh	,	come	on	,	man	.	``
``	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	go	 place 	 s 	 	.	``
but	what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	,	i	've	never	had	trouble	 travel 	 ing 	 	in	any	other	western	 count 	 ries 	 	with	my	american	 pass 	 port 	 	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	it	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	born	in	iran	.	``	no	 problem 	 s 	 	.
where	i	've	had	some	 problem 	 s 	 	is	some	of	the	arab	 count 	 ries 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	guess	some	of	the	arab	 count 	 ries 	 	are	n't	 get 	 ting 	 	 a 	 long 	 	with	iran	either	.
and	so	i	was	in	kuwait	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	 do 	 ing 	 	a	 come 	 dy 	 	show	with	some	other	american	 comedian 	 s 	 	.
they	all	went	through	,	and	then	the	border	patrol	saw	my	american	 pass 	 port 	 	.
``	ah	ha	!	american	,	great	.	``
then	he	 open 	 ed 	 	it	up	.	``	born	in	iran	?	wait	.	``
and	he	 start 	 ed 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	me	 question 	 s 	 	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	is	your	father	's	name	?	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	he	's	 pass 	 ed 	 	away	,	but	his	name	was	khosro	.	``
he	 go 	 es 	 	,	``	what	is	your	 grand 	 father 	 	's	name	?	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	he	 pass 	 ed 	 	away	a	long	time	ago	.
his	name	was	jabbar	.	``
he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	you	wait	.	i	'll	be	back	,	``	and	he	 walk 	 ed 	 	away	.
and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 freak 	 ing 	 	out	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	do	n't	know	what	kind	of	crap	my	 grand 	 father 	 	was	 in 	 to 	 	.
thought	the	guy	was	going	to	come	back	and	be	like	,	``	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	looking	for	you	for	200	 year 	 s 	 	.	``
``	your	 grand 	 father 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 park 	 ing 	 	 viol 	 ation 	 	.	it	's	way	 over 	 due 	 	.
you	owe	us	two	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	.	``
but	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	when	i	talk	,	i	speak	with	an	american	accent	,	which	you	would	think	 a 	 s 	 	an	iranian	-	american	 a 	 ctor 	 	,	i	should	be	able	to	play	any	part	,	good	,	bad	,	what	have	you	.
but	a	lot	of	 time 	 s 	 	in	hollywood	,	when	 cast 	 ing 	 	 director 	 s 	 	find	out	you	're	of	middle	eastern	 d 	 escent 	 	,	they	go	,	``	oh	,	you	're	iranian	.	great	.
can	you	say	'	i	will	kill	you	in	the	name	of	allah	?	'	``	``	i	could	say	that	,	but	what	if	i	 we 	 re 	 	to	say	,	'	 hell 	 o 	 	.	i	'm	your	doctor	?	'	``
they	go	,	``	great	.	and	then	you	hijack	the	hospital	.	``
like	i	think	you	're	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	the	point	here	.
do	n't	get	me	wrong	,	i	do	n't	mind	 play 	 ing 	 	bad	 guy 	 s 	 	.
i	want	to	play	a	bad	guy	.	i	want	to	rob	a	bank	.
i	want	to	rob	a	bank	in	a	film	.	i	want	to	rob	a	bank	in	a	film	,	but	do	it	with	a	gun	,	with	a	gun	,	not	with	a	bomb	 s 	 trapped 	 	around	me	,	right	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	imagine	the	director	:	``	maz	,	i	think	your	character	would	rob	the	bank	with	a	bomb	around	him	.	``
``	why	would	i	do	that	?
if	i	want	the	money	,	why	would	i	kill	 my 	 self 	 	?	``
right	.
``	gim	me	all	your	money	,	or	i	'll	blow	 my 	 self 	 	up	.	``
``	well	,	then	blow	 your 	 self 	 	up	.
just	do	it	 out 	 side 	 	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	.	``
but	the	fact	is	,	there	's	good	people	 every 	 where 	 	.
that	's	what	i	try	and	show	in	my	stand	-	up	.	there	's	good	people	 every 	 where 	 	.
all	it	 take 	 s 	 	in	one	person	to	mess	it	up	.	like	a	couple	 month 	 s 	 	ago	in	 time 	 s 	 	square	in	new	york	,	there	was	 th 	 is 	 	pakistani	muslim	guy	who	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	blow	up	a	car	bomb	.
now	,	i	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	be	in	 time 	 s 	 	square	that	night	 do 	 ing 	 	a	 come 	 dy 	 	show	.
and	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	before	that	,	there	was	a	white	american	guy	in	austin	,	texas	who	flew	his	 air 	 plane 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	irs	building	,	and	i	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	be	in	austin	that	day	 do 	 ing 	 	a	stand	-	up	 come 	 dy 	 	show	.
now	i	'll	tell	you	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	middle	eastern	male	,	when	you	show	up	around	a	lot	of	these	 activ 	 ities 	 	,	you	start	 feel 	 ing 	 	 guilt 	 y 	 	at	one	point	.
i	was	 watch 	 ing 	 	the	news	.	i	'm	like	,	``	am	i	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	crap	?	``
``	i	did	n't	get	the	memo	.	what	's	going	on	?	``
but	what	was	 interest 	 ing 	 	was	,	the	pakistani	muslim	guy	--	see	he	 give 	 s 	 	a	bad	name	to	muslims	and	middle	easterners	and	pakistanis	from	all	over	the	world	.
and	one	thing	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	there	was	 al 	 so 	 	the	pakistani	taliban	took	credit	for	that	 fail 	 ed 	 	car	 bomb 	 ing 	 	.
my	question	is	:	why	would	you	take	credit	for	a	 fail 	 ed 	 	car	 bomb 	 ing 	 	?
``	we	just	 want 	 ed 	 	to	say	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	.	``
``	and	 further 	 more 	 	,	it	is	the	thought	that	 count 	 s 	 	.	``
``	and	in	 con 	 clusion 	 	,	win	some	,	lose	some	.	``
but	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	was	,	when	the	white	guy	flew	his	plane	 in 	 to 	 	the	building	,	i	know	all	my	middle	eastern	and	muslim	 friend 	 s 	 	in	the	 state 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	tv	,	going	,	``	 pleas 	 e 	 	,	do	n't	be	middle	eastern	.
do	n't	be	hassan	.	do	n't	be	hussein	.	``
and	the	name	came	out	jack	.	i	'm	like	,	``	woooo	!
that	's	not	one	of	us	.	``
but	i	 ke 	 pt 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	the	news	in	case	they	came	back	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	like	,	``	before	he	did	it	,	he	 convert 	 ed 	 	to	islam	.	``
``	damn	it	!	why	jack	?	why	?	``
but	the	fact	is	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	to	get	a	chance	to	perform	all	over	the	world	,	and	i	did	a	lot	of	 show 	 s 	 	in	the	middle	east	.
i	just	did	a	seven	-	country	 s 	 olo 	 	tour	.
i	was	in	oman	,	and	i	was	in	saudi	arabia	.
i	was	in	dubai	.
and	it	's	great	,	there	's	good	people	 every 	 where 	 	.
and	you	learn	great	 thing 	 s 	 	about	these	 place 	 s 	 	.
i	 encourag 	 e 	 	people	 al 	 ways 	 	to	go	visit	these	 place 	 s 	 	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	dubai	--	cool	place	.
they	're	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	 big 	 gest 	 	,	 tall 	 est 	 	,	 long 	 est 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	all	know	.
they	have	a	mall	there	,	the	dubai	mall	.
it	is	so	big	,	they	have	 taxi 	 s 	 	in	the	mall	.
i	was	 walk 	 ing 	 	.	i	heard	``	beep	,	beep	.	``
i	'm	like	,	``	what	are	you	 do 	 ing 	 	here	?	``
he	 go 	 es 	 	,	``	i	'm	going	to	the	zara	store	.	it	's	three	 mile 	 s 	 	away	.
and	what	's	crazy	--	there	's	a	 recess 	 ion 	 	going	on	,	even	in	dubai	,	but	you	would	n't	know	by	the	 price 	 s 	 	.
like	in	the	dubai	mall	,	they	sell	 froze 	 n 	 	yogurt	by	the	gram	.
it	's	like	a	drug	deal	.

he	's	like	,	``	good	stuff	,	man	.	columbian	.	top	of	the	line	.	top	of	the	line	.	``	the	other	thing	you	learn	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	when	you	travel	to	these	 count 	 ries 	 	in	the	middle	east	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	in	latin	american	 count 	 ries 	 	,	south	american	 count 	 ries 	 	--	a	lot	of	 time 	 s 	 	when	they	build	stuff	,	there	's	no	 rule 	 s 	 	and	 regulat 	 ions 	 	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	i	took	my	two	year	-	old	son	to	the	 play 	 ground 	 	at	the	dubai	mall	.
and	i	've	taken	my	two	year	-	old	son	to	 play 	 ground 	 s 	 	all	over	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
and	when	you	put	your	two	year	-	old	on	a	slide	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	they	put	 some 	 thing 	 	on	the	slide	to	 s 	 low 	 	the	kid	down	 a 	 s 	 	he	 come 	 s 	 	down	the	slide	.
not	in	the	middle	east	.
i	put	my	two	year	-	old	on	the	slide	;	he	went	frrmrmm	!	he	took	off	.	i	went	down	.	i	go	,	``	where	's	my	son	?	``

``	try	the	yogurt	.	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	good	.	little	expensive	.	``
but	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	i	try	to	do	with	my	stand	-	up	is	to	break	 stereo 	 type 	 s 	 	.
and	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 guilt 	 y 	 	of	 stereo 	 ty 	 ping 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
i	was	in	dubai	.	and	there	's	a	lot	of	 in 	 d 	 ians 	 	who	work	in	dubai	.
and	they	do	n't	get	paid	that	well	.
and	i	got	it	in	my	head	that	all	the	 in 	 d 	 ians 	 	there	must	be	 work 	 ers 	 	.
and	i	 for 	 got 	 	there	's	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	 in 	 d 	 ians 	 	in	dubai	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
