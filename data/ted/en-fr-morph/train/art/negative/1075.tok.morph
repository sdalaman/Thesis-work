i	want	you	to	take	a	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	baby	.
what	you	're	drawn	to	are	her	 eye 	 s 	 	and	the	skin	you	love	to	touch	.
but	 to 	 day 	 	i	'm	going	to	talk	to	you	about	 some 	 thing 	 	you	ca	n't	see	--	what	's	going	on	up	in	that	little	brain	of	 her 	 s 	 	.
the	modern	 tool 	 s 	 	of	 neuro 	 science 	 	are	 demonst 	 rating 	 	to	us	that	what	's	going	on	up	there	is	 noth 	 ing 	 	short	of	rocket	science	.
and	what	we	're	 learn 	 ing 	 	is	going	to	shed	some	light	on	what	the	romantic	 writer 	 s 	 	and	 poet 	 s 	 	 de 	 scribed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	``	 ce 	 les 	 tial 	 	 open 	 ness 	 	``	of	the	child	's	mind	.
what	we	see	here	is	a	mother	in	india	,
and	she	's	 s 	 peaking 	 	koro	,	which	is	a	 new 	 ly 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	language	.
and	she	's	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	her	baby	.
what	 th 	 is 	 	mother	--	and	the	800	people	who	speak	koro	in	the	world	--	 understand 	 s 	 	[	is	]	that	,	to	preserve	 th 	 is 	 	language	,	they	need	to	speak	it	to	the	 bab 	 ies 	 	.
and	 there 	 in 	 	lies	a	critical	 puzzl 	 e 	 	.
why	is	it	that	you	ca	n't	preserve	a	language	by	 s 	 peaking 	 	to	you	and	i	,	to	the	 adult 	 s 	 	?
well	,	it	's	got	to	do	with	your	brain	.
what	we	see	here	is	that	language	 ha 	 s 	 	a	critical	period	for	 learn 	 ing 	 	.
the	way	to	read	 th 	 is 	 	slide	is	to	look	at	your	age	on	the	 horizon 	 tal 	 	axis	.
and	you	'll	see	on	the	 vert 	 ical 	 	your	skill	at	 acquir 	 ing 	 	a	second	language	.
 bab 	 ies 	 	and	children	are	 gen 	 ius 	 es 	 	 un 	 til 	 	they	turn	seven	,	and	then	there	's	a	 system 	 atic 	 	decline	.
after	puberty	,	we	fall	off	the	map	.
no	 scientist 	 s 	 	 disput 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 curv 	 e 	 	,	but	 labor 	 ator 	 ies 	 	all	over	the	world	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	why	it	 work 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
work	in	my	lab	is	focused	on	the	first	critical	period	in	 develop 	 ment 	 	--	and	that	is	the	period	in	which	 bab 	 ies 	 	try	to	master	which	 sound 	 s 	 	are	used	in	 the 	 ir 	 	language	.
we	think	,	by	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	how	the	 sound 	 s 	 	are	 learn 	 ed 	 	,	we	'll	have	a	model	for	the	rest	of	language	,	and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	for	critical	 period 	 s 	 	that	may	exist	in	 child 	 hood 	 	for	social	,	 emotion 	 al 	 	and	cognitive	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
so	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	the	 bab 	 ies 	 	using	a	 techni 	 que 	 	that	we	're	using	all	over	the	world	and	the	 sound 	 s 	 	of	all	 language 	 s 	 	.
the	baby	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	on	a	parent	's	lap	,	and	we	train	them	to	turn	 the 	 ir 	 	 head 	 s 	 	when	a	sound	 change 	 s 	 	--	like	from	``	ah	``	to	``	ee	.	``	if	they	do	so	at	the	appropriate	time	,	the	black	box	 light 	 s 	 	up	and	a	 pan 	 da 	 	bear	 pound 	 s 	 	a	drum	.
a	six	-	monther	 ador 	 es 	 	the	task	.
what	have	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	?
well	,	 bab 	 ies 	 	all	over	the	world	are	what	i	like	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	 a 	 s 	 	``	 citizen 	 s 	 	of	the	world	.	``	they	can	discriminate	all	the	 sound 	 s 	 	of	all	 language 	 s 	 	,	no	matter	what	country	we	're	 test 	 ing 	 	and	what	language	we	're	using	,
and	that	's	 remark 	 able 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	you	and	i	ca	n't	do	that	.
we	're	culture	-	bound	 listen 	 ers 	 	.
we	can	discriminate	the	 sound 	 s 	 	of	our	own	language	,	but	not	 t 	 hose 	 	of	foreign	 language 	 s 	 	.
so	the	question	 arise 	 s 	 	:	when	do	 t 	 hose 	 	 citizen 	 s 	 	of	the	world	turn	 in 	 to 	 	the	language	-	bound	 listen 	 ers 	 	that	we	are	?
and	the	answer	:	before	 the 	 ir 	 	first	 birth 	 day 	 s 	 	.
what	you	see	here	is	performance	on	that	head	-	turn	task	for	 bab 	 ies 	 	tested	in	tokyo	and	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	here	in	seattle	,	 a 	 s 	 	they	 listen 	 ed 	 	to	``	ra	``	and	``	la	``	--	 sound 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	english	,	but	not	to	japanese	.
so	at	six	to	eight	 month 	 s 	 	the	 bab 	 ies 	 	are	 total 	 ly 	 	 equi 	 valent 	 	.
two	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	 occur 	 s 	 	.
the	 bab 	 ies 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	are	 get 	 ting 	 	a	lot	better	,	 bab 	 ies 	 	in	japan	are	 get 	 ting 	 	a	lot	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	but	both	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 group 	 s 	 	of	 bab 	 ies 	 	are	 pre 	 par 	 ing 	 	for	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	language	that	they	are	going	to	learn	.
so	the	question	is	:	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	critical	two	-	month	period	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	critical	period	for	sound	 develop 	 ment 	 	,	but	what	's	going	on	up	there	?
so	there	are	two	 thing 	 s 	 	going	on	.
the	first	is	that	the	 bab 	 ies 	 	are	 listen 	 ing 	 	 intent 	 ly 	 	to	us	,	and	they	're	taking	 statistic 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	listen	to	us	talk	--	they	're	taking	 statistic 	 s 	 	.
so	listen	to	two	 mother 	 s 	 	 s 	 peaking 	 	 mother 	 ese 	 	--	the	universal	language	we	use	when	we	talk	to	 kid 	 s 	 	--	first	in	english	and	then	in	japanese	.	english	mother	:	ah	,	i	love	your	big	blue	 eye 	 s 	 	--	so	 pre 	 tty 	 	and	nice	.
japanese	mother	:	[	japanese	]	patricia	kuhl	:	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	production	of	speech	,	when	 bab 	 ies 	 	listen	,	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	is	taking	 statistic 	 s 	 	on	the	language	that	they	hear	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	 distribut 	 ions 	 	grow	.
and	what	we	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	is	that	 bab 	 ies 	 	are	sensitive	to	the	 statistic 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 statistic 	 s 	 	of	japanese	and	english	are	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	different	.	english	 ha 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	rs	and	ls	.	the	 distribut 	 ion 	 	 show 	 s 	 	.
and	the	 distribut 	 ion 	 	of	japanese	is	 total 	 ly 	 	different	,	where	we	see	a	group	of	 inter 	 mediate 	 	 sound 	 s 	 	,	which	is	known	 a 	 s 	 	the	japanese	``	r.	``
so	 bab 	 ies 	 	absorb	the	 statistic 	 s 	 	of	the	language	and	it	 change 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 brain 	 s 	 	;	it	 change 	 s 	 	them	from	the	 citizen 	 s 	 	of	the	world	to	the	culture	-	bound	 listen 	 ers 	 	that	we	are	.
but	we	 a 	 s 	 	 adult 	 s 	 	are	no	 long 	 er 	 	 absorb 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 statistic 	 s 	 	.
we	're	 govern 	 ed 	 	by	the	 represent 	 ations 	 	in	 memor 	 y 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 form 	 ed 	 	early	in	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
so	what	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	here	is	changing	our	 model 	 s 	 	of	what	the	critical	period	is	about	.
we	're	 argu 	 ing 	 	from	a	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 stand 	 point 	 	that	the	 learn 	 ing 	 	of	language	material	may	 s 	 low 	 	down	when	our	 distribut 	 ions 	 	 stabil 	 ize 	 	.
it	's	raising	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 question 	 s 	 	about	 bi 	 lingual 	 	people	.
 bi 	 lingual 	 s 	 	must	keep	two	 set 	 s 	 	of	 statistic 	 s 	 	in	mind	at	once	and	flip	between	them	,	one	after	the	other	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	who	they	're	 s 	 peaking 	 	to	.
so	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	can	the	 bab 	 ies 	 	take	 statistic 	 s 	 	on	a	brand	new	language	?
and	we	tested	 th 	 is 	 	by	 ex 	 posing 	 	american	 bab 	 ies 	 	who	'd	never	heard	a	second	language	to	mandarin	for	the	first	time	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	critical	period	.
we	 k 	 new 	 	that	,	when	 mono 	 lingual 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	tested	in	taipei	and	seattle	on	the	mandarin	 sound 	 s 	 	,	they	 show 	 ed 	 	the	same	pattern	.
six	to	eight	 month 	 s 	 	,	they	're	 total 	 ly 	 	 equi 	 valent 	 	.
two	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	.
but	the	taiwanese	 bab 	 ies 	 	are	 get 	 ting 	 	better	,	not	the	american	 bab 	 ies 	 	.
what	we	did	was	 ex 	 pose 	 	american	 bab 	 ies 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	period	to	mandarin	.
it	was	like	 hav 	 ing 	 	mandarin	 relat 	 ive 	 s 	 	come	and	visit	for	a	month	and	move	 in 	 to 	 	your	house	and	talk	to	the	 bab 	 ies 	 	for	12	 session 	 s 	 	.
here	's	what	it	 look 	 ed 	 	like	in	the	 labor 	 atory 	 	.
mandarin	speaker	:	[	mandarin	]	pk	:	so	what	have	we	 d 	 one 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	little	 brain 	 s 	 	?
we	had	to	run	a	control	group	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	just	coming	 in 	 to 	 	the	 labor 	 atory 	 	did	n't	improve	your	mandarin	 skill 	 s 	 	.
so	a	group	of	 bab 	 ies 	 	came	in	and	 listen 	 ed 	 	to	english	.
and	we	can	see	from	the	graph	that	 expo 	 s 	 ure 	 	to	english	did	n't	improve	 the 	 ir 	 	mandarin	.
but	look	at	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	the	 bab 	 ies 	 	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	to	mandarin	for	12	 session 	 s 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 a 	 s 	 	good	 a 	 s 	 	the	 bab 	 ies 	 	in	taiwan	who	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 listen 	 ing 	 	for	10	-	and	-	a	-	half	 month 	 s 	 	.
what	it	 demonst 	 rated 	 	is	that	 bab 	 ies 	 	take	 statistic 	 s 	 	on	a	new	language	.
 what 	 ever 	 	you	put	in	front	of	them	,	they	'll	take	 statistic 	 s 	 	on	.
but	we	 wonder 	 ed 	 	what	role	the	human	 be 	 ing 	 	 play 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	 exercis 	 e 	 	.
so	we	ran	 an 	 other 	 	group	of	 bab 	 ies 	 	in	which	the	 kid 	 s 	 	got	the	same	 do 	 s 	 age 	 	,	the	same	12	 session 	 s 	 	,	but	over	a	 tele 	 vision 	 	set	and	 an 	 other 	 	group	of	 bab 	 ies 	 	who	had	just	audio	 expo 	 s 	 ure 	 	and	 look 	 ed 	 	at	a	 ted 	 dy 	 	bear	on	the	screen	.	what	did	we	do	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 brain 	 s 	 	?
what	you	see	here	is	the	audio	result	--	no	 learn 	 ing 	 	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	--	and	the	video	result	--	no	 learn 	 ing 	 	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	.
it	 take 	 s 	 	a	human	 be 	 ing 	 	for	 bab 	 ies 	 	to	take	 the 	 ir 	 	 statistic 	 s 	 	.
the	social	brain	is	 controll 	 ing 	 	when	the	 bab 	 ies 	 	are	taking	 the 	 ir 	 	 statistic 	 s 	 	.
we	want	to	get	 in 	 side 	 	the	brain	and	see	 th 	 is 	 	thing	 happen 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 bab 	 ies 	 	are	in	front	of	 tele 	 vision 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	in	front	of	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
 thank 	 fully 	 	,	we	have	a	new	machine	,	 magnet 	 o 	 encephalo 	 graphy 	 	,	that	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	hair	 dry 	 er 	 	from	mars	.	but	it	's	 complete 	 ly 	 	safe	,	 complete 	 ly 	 	non	-	invasive	and	silent	.
we	're	looking	at	millimeter	 accu 	 racy 	 	with	regard	to	spatial	and	 milli 	 second 	 	 accu 	 racy 	 	using	306	 s 	 quid 	 s 	 	--	these	are	 super 	 conduct 	 ing 	 	 quant 	 um 	 	 inter 	 ference 	 	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	--	to	pick	up	the	 magnet 	 ic 	 	 field 	 s 	 	that	change	 a 	 s 	 	we	do	our	 think 	 ing 	 	.
we	're	the	first	in	the	world	to	record	 bab 	 ies 	 	in	an	meg	machine	while	they	are	 learn 	 ing 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	little	emma	.
she	's	a	six	-	monther	.
and	she	's	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	 vari 	 ous 	 	 language 	 s 	 	in	the	 ear 	 phone 	 s 	 	that	are	in	her	 ear 	 s 	 	.
you	can	see	,	she	can	move	around	.
we	're	 track 	 ing 	 	her	head	with	little	 pel 	 lets 	 	in	a	cap	,
so	she	's	free	to	move	 complete 	 ly 	 	 un 	 con 	 s 	 trained 	 	.
it	's	a	technical	tour	de	force	.
what	are	we	 see 	 ing 	 	?
we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	the	baby	brain	.
 a 	 s 	 	the	baby	 hear 	 s 	 	a	word	in	her	language
the	 audit 	 ory 	 	 area 	 s 	 	light	up	,	and	then	 sub 	 sequent 	 ly 	 	 area 	 s 	 	 surround 	 ing 	 	it	that	we	think	are	related	to	 cohere 	 nce 	 	,	 get 	 ting 	 	the	brain	 coordinate 	 d 	 	with	 it 	 s 	 	different	 area 	 s 	 	,	and	 caus 	 ality 	 	,	one	brain	area	 caus 	 ing 	 	 an 	 other 	 	to	activate	.
we	are	 embark 	 ing 	 	on	a	grand	and	 gold 	 en 	 	age	of	knowledge	about	child	's	brain	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
we	're	going	to	be	able	to	see	a	child	's	brain	 a 	 s 	 	they	experience	an	emotion	,	 a 	 s 	 	they	learn	to	speak	and	read	,	 a 	 s 	 	they	solve	a	math	problem	,	 a 	 s 	 	they	have	an	idea	.
and	we	're	going	to	be	able	to	invent	brain	-	based	 intervention 	 s 	 	for	children	who	have	 difficult 	 y 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	.
just	 a 	 s 	 	the	 poet 	 s 	 	and	 writer 	 s 	 	 de 	 scribed 	 	,	we	're	going	to	be	able	to	see	,	i	think	,	that	 won 	 dr 	 ous 	 	 open 	 ness 	 	,	utter	and	complete	 open 	 ness 	 	,	of	the	mind	of	a	child	.
in	 invest 	 ig 	 ating 	 	the	child	's	brain	,	we	're	going	to	 un 	 cover 	 	deep	 truth 	 s 	 	about	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	to	be	human	,	and	in	the	process	,	we	may	be	able	to	help	keep	our	own	 mind 	 s 	 	open	to	 learn 	 ing 	 	for	our	entire	 live 	 s 	 	.
thank	you	.
