i	want	to	talk	about	what	we	learn	from	 conserv 	 ative 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'm	at	a	stage	in	life	where	i	'm	 year 	 ning 	 	for	my	old	 day 	 s 	 	,	so	i	want	to	confess	to	you	that	when	i	was	a	kid	,	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	i	was	a	 conserv 	 ative 	 	.
i	was	a	young	republican	,	a	 teen 	 age 	 	republican	,	a	 lead 	 er 	 	in	the	 teen 	 age 	 	republicans	.
 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	i	was	the	 young 	 est 	 	member	of	any	 deleg 	 ation 	 	in	the	1980	convention	that	 elect 	 ed 	 	ronald	reagan	to	be	the	republican	nominee	for	 p 	 resident 	 	.
now	,	i	know	what	you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	.
you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	that	's	not	what	the	internets	say	.	``
you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	say	 th 	 is 	 	fact	.	``
and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	one	of	the	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	the	junk	that	 flow 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 tube 	 s 	 	in	these	internets	here	.
 wiki 	 pedia 	 	 report 	 s 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	guy	,	 th 	 is 	 	 form 	 er 	 	 congress 	 man 	 	from	erie	,	pennsylvania	was	,	at	the	age	of	20	,	one	of	the	 young 	 est 	 	people	at	the	republican	national	convention	,	but	it	's	just	not	true	.
 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	it	 drive 	 s 	 	me	so	nuts	,	let	me	just	change	 th 	 is 	 	little	fact	here	.
all	right	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	...	perfect	.
perfect	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	speaker	lawrence	lessig	,	right	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
 final 	 ly 	 	,	truth	will	be	 br 	 ought 	 	here	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	see	?	it	's	 d 	 one 	 	.	it	's	 al 	 most 	 	 d 	 one 	 	.	here	we	go	.
``	...	 young 	 est 	 	republican	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	we	're	 finish 	 ed 	 	.
that	's	it	.	 pleas 	 e 	 	 s 	 ave 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
great	,	here	we	go	.
and	...	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	is	 fix 	 ed 	 	,	 final 	 ly 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	but	no	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 be 	 side 	 s 	 	the	point	.
but	the	thing	i	want	you	to	think	about	when	we	think	about	 conserv 	 ative 	 s 	 	--	not	so	much	 th 	 is 	 	issue	of	the	1980	convention	--	the	thing	to	think	about	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	they	go	to	church	.
now	,	you	know	,	i	mean	,	a	lot	of	people	go	to	church	.
i	'm	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	that	 on 	 ly 	 	 conserv 	 ative 	 s 	 	go	to	church	.
and	i	'm	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	god	thing	.
i	do	n't	want	to	get	 in 	 to 	 	that	,	you	know	;	that	's	not	my	point	.
they	go	to	church	,	by	which	i	mean	,	they	do	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	for	free	for	each	other	.
they	hold	 pot 	 luck 	 	 d 	 inner 	 s 	 	.
 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	they	sell	 book 	 s 	 	about	 pot 	 luck 	 	 d 	 inner 	 s 	 	.
they	serve	food	to	poor	people	.
they	share	,	they	give	,	they	give	away	for	free	.
and	it	's	the	 ver 	 y 	 	same	people	 lead 	 ing 	 	wall	street	 firm 	 s 	 	who	,	on	sundays	,	show	up	and	share	.
and	not	 on 	 ly 	 	food	,	right	.
these	 ver 	 y 	 	same	people	are	strong	 believ 	 ers 	 	,	in	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 con 	 text 	 s 	 	,	in	the	 limit 	 s 	 	on	the	 market 	 s 	 	.
they	are	in	 man 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 place 	 s 	 	against	 market 	 s 	 	.
 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	they	,	like	all	of	us	,	 celebr 	 ate 	 	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	relationship	.
but	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	keen	that	we	do	n't	let	money	drop	 in 	 to 	 	that	relationship	,	else	it	 turn 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
they	want	to	 regulat 	 e 	 	us	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 conserv 	 ative 	 s 	 	,	to	stop	us	from	 allow 	 ing 	 	the	market	to	spread	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 place 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	they	understand	:	there	are	 place 	 s 	 	for	the	market	and	 place 	 s 	 	where	the	market	should	not	exist	,	where	we	should	be	free	to	enjoy	the	 fellow 	 ship 	 	of	 other 	 s 	 	.
they	 recogn 	 ize 	 	:	both	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	have	to	live	together	.
and	the	second	great	thing	about	 conserv 	 ative 	 s 	 	:	they	get	 eco 	 logy 	 	.
right	,	it	was	the	first	great	republican	 p 	 resident 	 	of	the	20th	century	who	taught	us	about	 environment 	 al 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	--	 ted 	 dy 	 	roosevelt	.
they	first	taught	us	about	 eco 	 logy 	 	in	the	 con 	 text 	 	of	natural	 resource 	 s 	 	.
and	then	they	 beg 	 an 	 	to	teach	us	in	the	 con 	 text 	 	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	 economic 	 s 	 	.
they	understand	,	in	that	 con 	 text 	 	,	``	free	.	``	they	understand	``	free	``	is	an	 import 	 ant 	 	essential	part	of	the	cultural	 eco 	 logy 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
that	's	the	thing	i	want	you	to	think	about	them	.
now	,	i	know	you	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	me	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	here	.
so	here	's	exhibit	number	one	.
i	want	to	share	with	you	my	 lat 	 est 	 	hero	,	julian	sanchez	,	a	libertarian	who	 work 	 s 	 	at	the	,	for	 man 	 y 	 	people	,	``	 e 	 vil 	 	``	cato	institute	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	julian	made	 th 	 is 	 	video	.
he	's	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	 produce 	 r 	 	of	 video 	 s 	 	,	but	it	's	great	content	,	so	i	'm	going	to	give	you	a	little	bit	of	it	.
so	here	he	is	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
julian	sanchez	:	i	'm	going	to	make	an	 observ 	 ation 	 	about	the	way	remix	culture	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	 evolv 	 ing 	 	...
larry	lessig	:	so	what	he	 do 	 es 	 	is	he	 begin 	 s 	 	to	tell	us	about	these	three	 video 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	fantastic	 bra 	 t 	 	pack	remix	set	to	lisztomania	.
which	,	of	course	,	spread	 viral 	 ly 	 	.
 huge 	 ly 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	.
and	then	some	people	from	brooklyn	saw	it	.	they	 decide 	 d 	 	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	the	same	.
and	then	,	of	course	,	people	from	san	fransisco	saw	it	.
and	san	franciscans	thought	they	had	to	do	the	same	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
and	so	they	're	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	libertarian	 ha 	 s 	 	some	 import 	 ant 	 	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	he	 want 	 s 	 	us	to	learn	from	 th 	 is 	 	.
here	's	 less 	 on 	 	number	one	.
js	:	there	's	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 deep 	 ly 	 	great	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
they	are	 act 	 ing 	 	in	the	sense	that	they	're	 emul 	 ating 	 	the	original	 mash 	 up 	 	.
and	the	guy	who	shot	it	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	strong	eye	and	some	experience	with	video	 edit 	 ing 	 	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	just	a	group	of	 friend 	 s 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	an	authentic	social	moment	and	 screw 	 ing 	 	around	together	.
it	should	feel	familiar	and	kind	of	 reson 	 ate 	 	for	 any 	 one 	 	who	's	had	a	 s 	 ing 	 	-	a	-	long	or	a	dance	party	with	a	group	of	good	 friend 	 s 	 	.
ll	:	or	...
js	:	so	that	's	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	different	from	the	 ear 	 lier 	 	 video 	 s 	 	we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 be 	 cause 	 	here	,	remix	is	n't	just	about	an	individual	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 al 	 one 	 	in	his	 base 	 ment 	 	;	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	an	act	of	social	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	.
and	it	's	not	just	that	it	 yield 	 s 	 	a	different	kind	of	product	at	the	end	,	it	's	that	 potential 	 ly 	 	it	 change 	 s 	 	the	way	that	we	 re 	 late 	 	to	each	other	.
all	of	our	normal	social	 interact 	 ions 	 	 be 	 come 	 	a	kind	of	 invit 	 ation 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	 collect 	 ive 	 	 express 	 ion 	 	.
it	's	our	real	social	 live 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	that	are	 trans 	 mut 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	art	.
ll	:	and	so	then	,	what	 th 	 is 	 	libertarian	 draw 	 s 	 	from	these	two	 point 	 s 	 	...
js	:	one	remix	is	about	 individual 	 s 	 	using	our	 share 	 d 	 	culture	 a 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	language	to	communicate	 some 	 thing 	 	to	an	audience	.
stage	two	,	social	remix	,	is	 re 	 ally 	 	about	using	it	to	mediate	people	's	 relationship 	 s 	 	to	each	other	.
first	,	 with 	 in 	 	each	video	,	the	 bra 	 t 	 	pack	 character 	 s 	 	are	used	 a 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	template	for	 perform 	 ing 	 	the	social	 re 	 ality 	 	of	each	group	.
but	there	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	 dial 	 ogue 	 	between	the	 video 	 s 	 	,	where	,	once	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	structure	is	 establish 	 ed 	 	,	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	platform	for	 articul 	 ating 	 	the	 similar 	 ities 	 	and	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	between	the	 group 	 s 	 	'	social	and	physical	 world 	 s 	 	.
ll	:	and	then	,	here	's	for	me	,	the	critical	key	to	what	julian	 ha 	 s 	 	to	say	...
js	:	 copy 	 right 	 	policy	is	n't	just	about	how	to	incentivize	the	production	of	a	certain	kind	of	 art 	 istic 	 	 commodit 	 y 	 	;	it	's	about	what	level	of	control	we	're	going	to	permit	to	be	 exercis 	 ed 	 	over	our	social	 real 	 ities 	 	--	social	 real 	 ities 	 	that	are	now	 inevit 	 ably 	 	 permeate 	 d 	 	by	pop	culture	.
i	think	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	that	we	keep	these	two	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	public	 good 	 s 	 	in	mind	.
if	we	're	 on 	 ly 	 	focused	on	how	to	 maxim 	 ize 	 	the	supply	of	one	,	i	think	we	risk	 suppress 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	different	and	 rich 	 er 	 	and	,	in	some	ways	,	 may 	 be 	 	even	more	 import 	 ant 	 	one	.
ll	:	right	.	 bing 	 o 	 	.	point	.
 free 	 dom 	 	 need 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	both	have	the	commercial	success	of	the	great	commercial	 work 	 s 	 	and	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	build	 th 	 is 	 	different	kind	of	culture	.
and	for	that	to	happen	,	you	need	 idea 	 s 	 	like	fair	use	to	be	central	and	 protect 	 ed 	 	,	to	 en 	 able 	 	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	libertarian	 tell 	 s 	 	us	,	between	these	two	creative	 culture 	 s 	 	,	a	commercial	and	a	sharing	culture	.
the	point	is	they	,	he	,	here	,	 get 	 s 	 	that	culture	.
now	,	my	concern	is	,	we	dems	,	too	often	,	not	so	much	.
all	right	,	take	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	 th 	 is 	 	great	company	.
in	the	good	old	 day 	 s 	 	when	 th 	 is 	 	republican	ran	that	company	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 great 	 est 	 	work	was	work	that	built	on	the	past	,	right	.
all	of	the	great	disney	 work 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 work 	 s 	 	that	took	 work 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	in	the	public	domain	and	 remix 	 ed 	 	them	,	or	 wait 	 ed 	 	 un 	 til 	 	they	 enter 	 ed 	 	the	public	domain	to	remix	them	,	to	 celebr 	 ate 	 	 th 	 is 	 	add	-	on	remix	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	.
 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	mickey	mouse	 him 	 self 	 	,	of	course	,	 a 	 s 	 	``	steamboat	willie	,	``	is	a	remix	of	the	then	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 domin 	 ant 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	popular	``	steamboat	bill	``	by	buster	keaton	.
 th 	 is 	 	man	was	a	 remix 	 er 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 aire 	 	.
he	is	the	 celebr 	 ation 	 	and	ideal	of	 exact 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	.
but	then	the	company	 pass 	 es 	 	through	 th 	 is 	 	dark	stage	to	 th 	 is 	 	democrat	.
 wild 	 ly 	 	different	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 master 	 mind 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	the	 event 	 ual 	 	 pass 	 age 	 	of	what	we	call	the	sonny	bono	 copy 	 right 	 	term	 extens 	 ion 	 	act	,	 extend 	 ing 	 	the	term	of	 exist 	 ing 	 	 copy 	 right 	 s 	 	by	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	so	that	no	one	could	do	to	disney	what	disney	did	to	the	 brother 	 s 	 	grimm	.
now	,	when	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	 challeng 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	going	to	the	 suprem 	 e 	 	court	,	 get 	 ting 	 	the	 suprem 	 e 	 	court	,	the	bunch	of	 conserv 	 ative 	 s 	 	there	--	if	we	could	get	them	to	wake	up	to	 th 	 is 	 	--	to	strike	it	down	,
we	had	the	 assist 	 ance 	 	of	 no 	 bel 	 	prize	 winner 	 s 	 	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	right	-	wing	 no 	 bel 	 	prize	winner	,	milton	friedman	,	who	 s 	 aid 	 	he	would	join	our	brief	 on 	 ly 	 	if	the	word	``	no	 brain 	 er 	 	``	was	in	the	brief	 some 	 where 	 	.
but	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	,	no	 brain 	 s 	 	 exist 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	place	when	 democrat 	 s 	 	 pass 	 ed 	 	and	 sign 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	bill	 in 	 to 	 	law	.
now	,	 tin 	 y 	 	little	 qui 	 bble 	 	of	a	 foot 	 note 	 	:	sonny	bono	,	you	might	say	,	was	a	republican	,	but	i	do	n't	buy	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	guy	is	no	republican	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	for	a	second	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	cultural	hero	,	icon	on	the	left	,	creator	of	 th 	 is 	 	character	.
look	at	the	 s 	 ite 	 	that	he	built	:	``	star	 war 	 s 	 	``	 mash 	 up 	 s 	 	,	 invit 	 ing 	 	people	to	come	and	use	 the 	 ir 	 	creative	energy	to	produce	a	new	generation	of	attention	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 extra 	 ordinari 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	cultural	icon	.
read	the	 licens 	 e 	 	.
the	 licens 	 e 	 	for	these	 remix 	 ers 	 	 assign 	 s 	 	all	of	the	 right 	 s 	 	to	the	remix	back	to	lucas	.
the	 mash 	 up 	 	is	owned	by	lucas	.
 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	 any 	 thing 	 	you	add	to	the	 mash 	 up 	 	,	music	you	might	add	,	lucas	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 world 	 wide 	 	 perpetu 	 al 	 	right	to	exploit	that	for	free	.
there	is	no	creator	here	to	be	 recogn 	 ized 	 	.
the	creator	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	any	 right 	 s 	 	.
the	creator	is	a	sharecropper	in	 th 	 is 	 	story	.
and	we	should	remember	who	 employ 	 ed 	 	the	 sharecropper 	 s 	 	:	the	 democrat 	 s 	 	,	right	?
so	the	point	is	the	republicans	here	 recogn 	 ize 	 	that	there	's	a	certain	need	of	 owner 	 ship 	 	,	a	respect	for	 owner 	 ship 	 	,	the	respect	we	should	give	the	creator	,	the	 remix 	 er 	 	,	the	owner	,	the	 proper 	 ty 	 	owner	,	the	 copy 	 right 	 	owner	of	 th 	 is 	 	 extra 	 ordinari 	 ly 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	stuff	,	and	not	a	generation	of	 sharecropper 	 s 	 	.
now	,	i	think	there	are	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	we	should	learn	here	,	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	about	 open 	 ness 	 	.
our	 live 	 s 	 	are	sharing	 activ 	 ities 	 	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	in	part	.
even	for	the	head	of	goldman	sachs	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	in	part	.
and	for	that	sharing	activity	to	happen	,	we	have	to	have	well	-	 protect 	 ed 	 	 space 	 s 	 	of	fair	use	.
that	's	number	one	.	number	two	:	 th 	 is 	 	 eco 	 logy 	 	of	sharing	 need 	 s 	 	 free 	 dom 	 	 with 	 in 	 	which	to	create	.
 free 	 dom 	 	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 per 	 mission 	 	from	 any 	 one 	 	,	the	ability	to	create	.
and	number	three	:	we	need	to	respect	the	creator	,	the	creator	of	these	 remix 	 es 	 	through	 right 	 s 	 	that	are	 direct 	 ly 	 	 ti 	 ed 	 	to	them	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	 explain 	 s 	 	the	right	-	wing	 non 	 profit 	 	creative	 common 	 s 	 	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	not	a	right	-	wing	 non 	 profit 	 	,	but	of	course	--	let	me	just	tie	it	here	--	the	creative	 common 	 s 	 	,	which	is	 off 	 er 	 ing 	 	 author 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	simple	way	to	mark	 the 	 ir 	 	content	with	the	 free 	 dom 	 s 	 	they	 intend 	 ed 	 	to	carry	.
so	that	we	go	from	a	``	all	 right 	 s 	 	 re 	 serv 	 ed 	 	``	world	to	a	``	some	 right 	 s 	 	 re 	 serv 	 ed 	 	``	world	so	that	people	can	know	the	 free 	 dom 	 s 	 	they	have	 attach 	 ed 	 	to	the	content	,	building	and	creating	on	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	creative	 copy 	 right 	 ed 	 	work	.
these	 tool 	 s 	 	that	we	built	 en 	 able 	 	 th 	 is 	 	sharing	in	 part 	 s 	 	through	 licens 	 es 	 	that	make	it	clear	and	a	 free 	 dom 	 	to	create	 with 	 out 	 	 requir 	 ing 	 	 per 	 mission 	 	first	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 per 	 mission 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 grant 	 ed 	 	and	a	respect	for	the	creator	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 build 	 s 	 	 up 	 on 	 	a	 copy 	 right 	 	the	creator	 ha 	 s 	 	 licens 	 ed 	 	 free 	 ly 	 	.
and	it	 explain 	 s 	 	the	vast	right	-	wing	 conspi 	 racy 	 	that	's	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	around	these	 licens 	 es 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	now	more	than	350	million	digital	 object 	 s 	 	are	out	there	,	 licens 	 ed 	 	 free 	 ly 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
now	that	picture	of	an	 eco 	 logy 	 	of	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	,	the	picture	of	an	 eco 	 logy 	 	of	 balanc 	 ed 	 	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	,	is	that	the	 eco 	 logy 	 	of	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	we	have	right	now	?
well	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	all	know	,	not	 man 	 y 	 	of	us	 believ 	 e 	 	we	do	.
i	 trip 	 ped 	 	on	the	 re 	 ality 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 eco 	 logy 	 	of	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	just	last	week	.
i	 create 	 d 	 	a	video	which	was	based	on	a	wireside	chat	that	i	'd	 give 	 n 	 	,	and	i	 upload 	 ed 	 	it	to	youtube	.
i	then	got	 th 	 is 	 	email	from	youtube	 weird 	 ly 	 	 not 	 ifying 	 	me	that	there	was	content	in	that	owned	by	the	 myster 	 ious 	 	wmg	that	 match 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	content	id	.
so	i	did	n't	think	much	about	it	.
and	then	on	twitter	,	 some 	 body 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	``	your	talk	on	youtube	was	dmca	'd	.	was	that	your	purpose	?	``
 imagin 	 ing 	 	that	i	had	 th 	 is 	 	deep	 conspi 	 racy 	 	to	reveal	the	obvious	 flaw 	 s 	 	in	the	dmca	.
i	 answer 	 ed 	 	,	``	no.	``	i	did	n't	even	think	about	it	.
but	then	i	went	to	the	 s 	 ite 	 	and	all	of	the	audio	in	my	 s 	 ite 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	 silence 	 d 	 	.
my	whole	45	-	minute	video	had	 be 	 en 	 	 silence 	 d 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	there	 we 	 re 	 	 snip 	 pet 	 s 	 	in	that	video	,	a	video	about	fair	use	,	that	 include 	 d 	 	warner	music	group	music	.
now	,	 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	they	still	 s 	 old 	 	 ad 	 s 	 	for	that	music	,	if	you	 play 	 ed 	 	the	silent	video	.
you	could	still	buy	the	music	,	but	you	could	n't	hear	 any 	 thing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	had	 be 	 en 	 	 silence 	 d 	 	.
so	i	did	what	the	current	regime	 say 	 s 	 	i	must	do	to	be	free	to	use	youtube	to	talk	about	fair	use	.
i	went	to	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	and	i	had	to	answer	these	 question 	 s 	 	.
and	then	in	an	 extra 	 ordinari 	 ly 	 	bart	simpson	-	like	,	juvenile	way	you	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	got	to	type	out	these	 word 	 s 	 	and	get	them	right	to	 re 	 assert 	 	your	 free 	 dom 	 	to	speak	.
and	i	felt	like	i	was	in	third	grade	 aga 	 in 	 	.
``	i	will	not	put	 tack 	 s 	 	on	the	teacher	's	chair	.
i	will	not	put	 tack 	 s 	 	on	the	teacher	's	chair	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	absurd	.
it	is	 out 	 rage 	 ous 	 	.
it	is	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 per 	 version 	 	of	the	system	of	 free 	 dom 	 	we	should	be	 encourag 	 ing 	 	.
and	the	question	i	ask	you	is	:	who	's	 fight 	 ing 	 	it	?
well	,	 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	in	the	last	 p 	 resident 	 ial 	 	election	,	who	was	the	number	one	,	active	opponent	of	 th 	 is 	 	system	of	 regulat 	 ion 	 	in	 on 	 line 	 	speech	?
john	mccain	.
letter	after	letter	 attack 	 ing 	 	youtube	's	 re 	 f 	 usal 	 	to	be	more	 respect 	 ful 	 	of	fair	use	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	notice	and	take	down	system	,	that	led	his	campaign	so	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	to	be	 throw 	 n 	 	off	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
now	,	that	was	the	story	of	me	then	,	my	good	old	 day 	 s 	 	of	right	-	wing	 lun 	 acy 	 	.
let	me	come	back	to	now	,	now	when	i	'm	a	little	 left 	 ist 	 	--	i	'm	 certain 	 ly 	 	left	-	 hand 	 ed 	 	,	so	at	 l 	 east 	 	a	 left 	 y 	 	--	and	i	wonder	,	can	we	on	the	left	expect	to	build	 th 	 is 	 	 eco 	 logy 	 	of	 free 	 dom 	 	,	now	,	in	a	world	where	we	know	the	 extra 	 ordinari 	 ly 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	 influence 	 s 	 	against	it	,	where	even	 icon 	 s 	 	of	the	left	like	 th 	 is 	 	entertain	and	push	 bill 	 s 	 	that	would	 effective 	 ly 	 	ban	the	 requir 	 ement 	 	of	open	access	for	government	-	funded	research	?
the	 p 	 resident 	 	,	who	 ha 	 s 	 	 support 	 ed 	 	a	process	that	 secret 	 ly 	 	 negoti 	 ates 	 	 agree 	 ments 	 	,	which	 effective 	 ly 	 	lock	us	 in 	 to 	 	the	 insan 	 e 	 	system	of	dmca	that	we	have	 adopt 	 ed 	 	and	 like 	 ly 	 	lock	us	down	a	path	of	three	 strike 	 s 	 	,	you	're	out	that	,	of	course	,	the	rest	of	the	world	are	 increasing 	 ly 	 	 adopt 	 ing 	 	.
not	a	single	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	reform	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 produce 	 d 	 	yet	.
and	we	're	not	going	to	see	 th 	 is 	 	change	in	 th 	 is 	 	system	 any 	 time 	 	soon	.
so	here	's	the	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	of	 open 	 ness 	 	that	i	think	we	need	to	learn	.
 open 	 ness 	 	is	a	 commit 	 ment 	 	to	a	certain	set	of	 value 	 s 	 	.
we	need	to	speak	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 value 	 s 	 	.
the	value	of	 free 	 dom 	 	.	it	's	a	value	of	community	.
it	's	a	value	of	the	 limit 	 s 	 	in	 regulat 	 ion 	 	.
it	's	a	value	 respect 	 ing 	 	the	creator	.
now	,	if	we	can	learn	 t 	 hose 	 	 value 	 s 	 	from	at	 l 	 east 	 	some	 influence 	 s 	 	on	the	right	,	if	we	can	take	them	and	 in 	 corporate 	 	them	,	 may 	 be 	 	we	could	do	a	little	trade	.
we	learn	 t 	 hose 	 	 value 	 s 	 	on	the	left	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	they	'll	do	health	care	or	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	 legisl 	 ation 	 	or	 some 	 thing 	 	in	the	right	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	join	me	in	 teach 	 ing 	 	these	 value 	 s 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
