now	,	if	 p 	 resident 	 	obama	 invit 	 ed 	 	me	to	be	the	next	czar	of	 mathematic 	 s 	 	,	then	i	would	have	a	 suggest 	 ion 	 	for	him	that	i	think	would	 vast 	 ly 	 	improve	the	 mathematic 	 s 	 	education	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	.
and	it	would	be	easy	to	implement	and	 in 	 expensive 	 	.
the	 mathematic 	 s 	 	curriculum	that	we	have	is	based	on	a	 found 	 ation 	 	of	arithmetic	and	algebra	.
and	 every 	 thing 	 	we	learn	after	that	is	building	up	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	one	subject	.
and	at	top	of	that	pyramid	,	it	's	 calcul 	 us 	 	.
and	i	'm	here	to	say	that	i	think	that	that	is	the	wrong	 summ 	 it 	 	of	the	pyramid	...
that	the	correct	 summ 	 it 	 	--	that	all	of	our	 student 	 s 	 	,	every	high	school	graduate	should	know	--	should	be	 statistic 	 s 	 	:	 prob 	 ability 	 	and	 statistic 	 s 	 	.
i	mean	,	do	n't	get	me	wrong	.	 calcul 	 us 	 	is	an	 import 	 ant 	 	subject	.
it	's	one	of	the	great	 product 	 s 	 	of	the	human	mind	.
the	 law 	 s 	 	of	nature	are	written	in	the	language	of	 calcul 	 us 	 	.
and	every	student	who	 stud 	 ies 	 	math	,	science	,	 engineer 	 ing 	 	,	 economic 	 s 	 	,	they	should	 definite 	 ly 	 	learn	 calcul 	 us 	 	by	the	end	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 fresh 	 man 	 	year	of	college	.
but	i	'm	here	to	say	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	professor	of	 mathematic 	 s 	 	,	that	 ver 	 y 	 	few	people	 actual 	 ly 	 	use	 calcul 	 us 	 	in	a	conscious	,	 meaning 	 ful 	 	way	,	in	 the 	 ir 	 	day	-	to	-	day	 live 	 s 	 	.
on	the	other	hand	,	 statistic 	 s 	 	--	that	's	a	subject	that	you	could	,	and	should	,	use	on	 dai 	 ly 	 	 bas 	 is 	 	.	right	?
it	's	risk	.	it	's	reward	.	it	's	 random 	 ness 	 	.
it	's	 understand 	 ing 	 	data	.
i	think	if	our	 student 	 s 	 	,	if	our	high	school	 student 	 s 	 	--	if	all	of	the	american	 citizen 	 s 	 	--	 k 	 new 	 	about	 prob 	 ability 	 	and	 statistic 	 s 	 	,	we	would	n't	be	in	the	economic	mess	that	we	're	in	 to 	 day 	 	.
not	 on 	 ly 	 	--	thank	you	--	not	 on 	 ly 	 	that	...
but	if	it	's	taught	 proper 	 ly 	 	,	it	can	be	a	lot	of	 f 	 un 	 	.
i	mean	,	 prob 	 ability 	 	and	 statistic 	 s 	 	,	it	's	the	 mathematic 	 s 	 	of	 game 	 s 	 	and	 gam 	 bling 	 	.
it	's	 analyz 	 ing 	 	 trend 	 s 	 	.	it	's	 predict 	 ing 	 	the	future	.
look	,	the	world	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	from	analog	to	digital	.
and	it	's	time	for	our	 mathematic 	 s 	 	curriculum	to	change	from	analog	to	digital	,
from	the	more	 classic 	 al 	 	,	 continu 	 ous 	 	 mathematic 	 s 	 	,	to	the	more	modern	,	discrete	 mathematic 	 s 	 	--
the	 mathematic 	 s 	 	of	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	,	of	 random 	 ness 	 	,	of	data	--	that	 be 	 ing 	 	 prob 	 ability 	 	and	 statistic 	 s 	 	.
in	 summ 	 ary 	 	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	our	 student 	 s 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	about	the	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	of	 calcul 	 us 	 	,	i	think	it	would	be	far	more	significant	if	all	of	them	 k 	 new 	 	what	two	standard	 dev 	 iation 	 s 	 	from	the	mean	 mean 	 s 	 	.	and	i	mean	it	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
