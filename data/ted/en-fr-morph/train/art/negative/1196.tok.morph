the	question	 to 	 day 	 	is	not	:	why	did	we	 invad 	 e 	 	afghanistan	?
the	question	is	:	why	are	we	still	in	afghanistan	one	decade	 lat 	 er 	 	?
why	are	we	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	$	135	billion	?
why	have	we	got	130,000	 troop 	 s 	 	on	the	ground	?
why	 we 	 re 	 	more	people	 kill 	 ed 	 	last	month	than	in	any	 p 	 reced 	 ing 	 	month	of	 th 	 is 	 	conflict	?
how	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	?
the	last	20	 year 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	the	age	of	intervention	,	and	afghanistan	is	 simpl 	 y 	 	one	act	in	a	five	-	act	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	.
we	came	out	of	the	end	of	the	cold	war	in	despair	.
we	 face 	 d 	 	rwanda	;	we	 face 	 d 	 	bosnia	,	and	then	we	 re 	 discover 	 ed 	 	our	confidence	.
in	the	third	act	,	we	went	 in 	 to 	 	bosnia	and	kosovo	and	we	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	succeed	.
in	the	fourth	act	,	with	our	 hub 	 ris 	 	,	our	 over 	 confidence 	 	 develop 	 ing 	 	,	we	 invad 	 ed 	 	 ir 	 aq 	 	and	afghanistan	,
and	in	the	fifth	act	,	we	 plunge 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 humil 	 i 	 ating 	 	mess	.
so	the	question	is	:	what	are	we	 do 	 ing 	 	?
why	are	we	still	 s 	 tuck 	 	in	afghanistan	?
and	the	answer	,	of	course	,	that	we	keep	 be 	 ing 	 	 give 	 n 	 	is	 a 	 s 	 	 follow 	 s 	 	:	we	're	told	that	we	went	 in 	 to 	 	afghanistan	 be 	 cause 	 	of	9/11	,	and	that	we	remain	there	 be 	 cause 	 	the	taliban	 pose 	 s 	 	an	existential	threat	to	global	security	.
in	the	 word 	 s 	 	of	 p 	 resident 	 	obama	,	``	if	the	taliban	take	over	 aga 	 in 	 	,	they	will	 invit 	 e 	 	back	al-qaeda	,	who	will	try	to	kill	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	of	our	people	 a 	 s 	 	they	possibly	can	.	``	the	story	that	we	're	told	is	that	there	was	a	``	light	 foot 	 print 	 	``	 initi 	 ally 	 	--	in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	that	we	 end 	 ed 	 	up	in	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	where	we	did	n't	have	 en 	 ough 	 	 troop 	 s 	 	,	we	did	n't	have	 en 	 ough 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	,	that	afghans	 we 	 re 	 	 frust 	 rated 	 	--
they	felt	there	was	n't	 en 	 ough 	 	progress	and	economic	 develop 	 ment 	 	and	security	,	and	 there 	 fore 	 	the	taliban	came	back	--
that	we	 respond 	 ed 	 	in	2005	and	2006	with	troop	 deploy 	 ments 	 	,	but	we	still	did	n't	put	 en 	 ough 	 	 troop 	 s 	 	on	the	ground	.
and	that	it	was	n't	 un 	 til 	 	2009	,	when	 p 	 resident 	 	obama	 sign 	 ed 	 	off	on	a	 s 	 urge 	 	,	that	we	 final 	 ly 	 	had	,	in	the	 word 	 s 	 	of	 secret 	 ary 	 	clinton	,	``	the	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	,	the	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	and	the	 resource 	 s 	 	.	``
so	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	 p 	 resident 	 	now	 re 	 assure 	 s 	 	us	,	we	are	on	track	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	our	 goal 	 s 	 	.
all	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	wrong	.
every	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 state 	 ments 	 	is	wrong	.
afghanistan	 do 	 es 	 	not	pose	an	existential	threat	to	global	security	.
it	is	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 un 	 like 	 ly 	 	the	taliban	would	ever	be	able	to	take	over	the	country	--	they	 simpl 	 y 	 	do	n't	have	a	 convention 	 al 	 	 militar 	 y 	 	option	.
and	even	if	they	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	do	so	,	even	if	i	'm	wrong	,	it	's	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 un 	 like 	 ly 	 	the	taliban	would	 invit 	 e 	 	back	al	-	qaeda	.
from	the	taliban	's	point	of	view	,	that	was	 the 	 ir 	 	number	one	 mistak 	 e 	 	last	time	.
if	they	had	n't	 invit 	 ed 	 	back	al-qaeda	,	they	would	still	be	in	power	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	even	if	i	'm	wrong	about	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 thing 	 s 	 	,	even	if	they	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	take	back	the	country	,	even	if	they	 we 	 re 	 	to	 invit 	 e 	 	back	al-qaeda	,	it	's	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 un 	 like 	 ly 	 	that	al-qaeda	would	 significant 	 ly 	 	enhance	 it 	 s 	 	ability	to	harm	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	or	harm	europe	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	the	1990s	 any 	 more 	 	.
if	the	al-qaeda	base	was	to	be	 establish 	 ed 	 	near	ghazni	,	we	would	hit	them	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	,	and	it	would	be	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	for	the	taliban	to	protect	them	.
 further 	 more 	 	,	it	's	 simpl 	 y 	 	not	true	that	what	went	wrong	in	afghanistan	is	the	light	 foot 	 print 	 	.
in	my	experience	,	in	fact	,	the	light	 foot 	 print 	 	was	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 help 	 ful 	 	.
and	these	 troop 	 s 	 	that	we	 br 	 ought 	 	in	--	it	's	a	great	picture	of	david	beckham	there	on	the	sub	-	machine	gun	--	made	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	not	better	.
when	i	 walk 	 ed 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	afghanistan	in	the	winter	of	2001-2002	,	what	i	saw	was	 scene 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
a	girl	,	if	you	're	 luck 	 y 	 	,	in	the	corner	of	a	dark	room	--	 luck 	 y 	 	to	be	able	to	look	at	the	koran	.
but	in	 t 	 hose 	 	early	 day 	 s 	 	when	we	're	told	we	did	n't	have	 en 	 ough 	 	 troop 	 s 	 	and	 en 	 ough 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	,	we	made	a	lot	of	progress	in	afghanistan	.
 with 	 in 	 	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	two	and	a	half	million	more	 girl 	 s 	 	in	school	.
in	sangin	where	i	was	sick	in	2002	,	the	 near 	 est 	 	health	clinic	was	 with 	 in 	 	three	 day 	 s 	 	walk	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	there	are	14	health	 clinic 	 s 	 	in	that	area	 al 	 one 	 	.
there	was	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 improve 	 ments 	 	.
we	went	from	 al 	 most 	 	no	afghans	 hav 	 ing 	 	mobile	 tele 	 phone 	 s 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	taliban	to	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	where	,	 al 	 most 	 	 over 	 night 	 	,	three	million	afghans	had	mobile	 tele 	 phone 	 s 	 	.
and	we	had	progress	in	the	free	media	.	we	had	progress	in	 election 	 s 	 	--	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	with	the	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	light	 foot 	 print 	 	.
but	when	we	 beg 	 an 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	more	money	,	when	we	 beg 	 an 	 	to	invest	more	 resource 	 s 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	got	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	not	better	.	how	?
well	first	see	,	if	you	put	125	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	 in 	 to 	 	a	country	like	afghanistan	where	the	entire	revenue	of	the	afghan	state	is	one	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	,	you	drown	 every 	 thing 	 	.
it	's	not	 simpl 	 y 	 	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	and	waste	that	you	create	;	you	 essential 	 ly 	 	replace	the	 prior 	 ities 	 	of	the	afghan	government	,	the	 elect 	 ed 	 	afghan	government	,	with	the	 micro 	 man 	 aging 	 	 tend 	 encies 	 	of	 foreign 	 ers 	 	on	short	 tour 	 s 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 prior 	 ities 	 	.
and	the	same	is	true	for	the	 troop 	 s 	 	.
when	i	 walk 	 ed 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	afghanistan	,	i	 stay 	 ed 	 	with	people	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	commandant	haji	malem	mohsin	khan	of	kamenj	.
commandant	haji	malem	mohsin	khan	of	kamenj	was	a	great	host	.
he	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 gen 	 er 	 ous 	 	,	like	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	afghans	i	 stay 	 ed 	 	with	.
but	he	was	 al 	 so 	 	 consider 	 ably 	 	more	 conserv 	 ative 	 	,	 consider 	 ably 	 	more	anti	-	foreign	,	 consider 	 ably 	 	more	islamist	than	we	'd	like	to	 acknowledg 	 e 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	man	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	mullah	mustafa	,	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	shoot	me	.
and	the	reason	i	'm	looking	a	little	bit	 per 	 plex 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	photograph	is	i	was	 some 	 what 	 	 frighten 	 ed 	 	,	and	i	was	too	 af 	 raid 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	occasion	to	ask	him	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	run	for	an	hour	through	the	desert	and	taken	refuge	in	 th 	 is 	 	house	,	why	he	had	 turn 	 ed 	 	up	and	 want 	 ed 	 	to	have	his	photograph	taken	with	me	.
but	18	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	him	why	he	had	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	shoot	me	.
and	mullah	mustafa	--	he	's	the	man	with	the	pen	and	paper	--	 explain 	 ed 	 	that	the	man	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	to	the	left	 a 	 s 	 	you	look	at	the	photograph	,	nadir	shah	had	bet	him	that	he	could	n't	hit	me	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	to	say	afghanistan	is	a	place	full	of	people	like	mullah	mustafa	.
it	's	not	;	it	's	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	place	full	of	 in 	 credible 	 	energy	and	 intellig 	 ence 	 	.
but	it	is	a	place	where	the	 put 	 ting 	 	-	in	of	the	 troop 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	the	violence	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 de 	 crease 	 d 	 	it	.
2005	,	anthony	fitzherbert	,	an	 agricultur 	 al 	 	engineer	,	could	travel	through	helmand	,	could	stay	in	nad	ali	,	sangin	and	ghoresh	,	which	are	now	the	 name 	 s 	 	of	 village 	 s 	 	where	 fight 	 ing 	 	is	taking	place	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	he	could	never	do	that	.
so	the	idea	that	we	 deploy 	 ed 	 	the	 troop 	 s 	 	to	respond	to	the	taliban	insurgency	is	 mistak 	 en 	 	.
 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 p 	 reced 	 ing 	 	the	insurgency	,	the	taliban	 follow 	 ed 	 	the	troop	 deploy 	 ment 	 	,
and	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	i	'm	 concern 	 ed 	 	,	the	troop	 deploy 	 ment 	 	 caus 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	return	.
now	is	 th 	 is 	 	a	new	idea	?
no	,	there	have	 be 	 en 	 	any	number	of	people	 say 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	over	the	last	seven	 year 	 s 	 	.
i	ran	a	center	at	harvard	from	2008	to	2010	,
and	there	 we 	 re 	 	people	like	michael	semple	there	who	speak	afghan	 language 	 s 	 	 fluent 	 ly 	 	,	who	've	 travel 	 ed 	 	to	 al 	 most 	 	every	 di 	 strict 	 	in	the	country	.
andrew	 wild 	 er 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	born	on	the	pakistan	-	iranian	border	,	 serv 	 ed 	 	his	whole	life	in	pakistan	and	afghanistan	.
paul	fishstein	who	 beg 	 an 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	there	in	1978	--	 work 	 ed 	 	for	 s 	 ave 	 	the	children	,	ran	the	afghan	research	and	 evalu 	 ation 	 	unit	.
these	are	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	say	 consist 	 ent 	 ly 	 	that	the	 in 	 crease 	 	in	 develop 	 ment 	 	aid	was	making	afghanistan	less	secure	,	not	more	secure	--	that	the	counter	-	insurgency	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	was	not	 work 	 ing 	 	and	would	not	work	.
and	yet	,	 no 	 body 	 	 listen 	 ed 	 	to	them	.
 in 	 stead 	 	,	there	was	a	 lit 	 any 	 	of	 astonish 	 ing 	 	 optim 	 ism 	 	.
 begin 	 ning 	 	in	2004	,	every	general	came	in	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	i	've	 inherit 	 ed 	 	a	 dis 	 mal 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	but	 final 	 ly 	 	i	have	the	right	 resource 	 s 	 	and	the	correct	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	,	which	will	deliver	,	``	in	general	barno	's	word	in	2004	,	the	``	 decis 	 ive 	 	year	.	``
well	guess	what	?	it	did	n't	.
but	it	was	n't	sufficient	to	prevent	general	abuzaid	 say 	 ing 	 	that	he	had	the	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	and	the	 resource 	 s 	 	to	deliver	,	in	2005	,	the	``	 decis 	 ive 	 	year	.	``
or	general	david	richards	to	come	in	2006	and	say	he	had	the	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	and	the	 resource 	 s 	 	to	deliver	the	``	crunch	year	.	``
or	in	2007	,	the	norwegian	 de 	 put 	 y 	 	foreign	 mini 	 ster 	 	,	espen	eide	,	to	say	that	that	would	deliver	the	``	 decis 	 ive 	 	year	.	``
or	in	2008	,	major	general	champoux	to	come	in	and	say	he	would	deliver	the	``	 decis 	 ive 	 	year	.	``
or	in	2009	,	my	great	friend	,	general	stanley	mcchrystal	,	who	 s 	 aid 	 	that	he	was	``	knee	-	deep	in	the	 decis 	 ive 	 	year	.	``
or	in	2010	,	the	u.k.	foreign	 secret 	 ary 	 	,	david	miliband	,	who	 s 	 aid 	 	that	at	last	we	would	deliver	the	``	 decis 	 ive 	 	year	.	``
and	you	'll	be	 de 	 light 	 ed 	 	to	hear	in	2011	,	 to 	 day 	 	,	that	guido	westerwelle	,	the	german	foreign	 mini 	 ster 	 	,	 assure 	 s 	 	us	that	we	are	in	the	``	 decis 	 ive 	 	year	.	``
how	do	we	allow	any	of	 th 	 is 	 	to	happen	?
well	the	answer	,	of	course	,	is	,	if	you	 s 	 pend 	 	125	billion	or	130	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	in	a	country	,	you	co	-	opt	 al 	 most 	 	 every 	 body 	 	.	even	the	aid	 age 	 ncies 	 	,	who	begin	to	 receiv 	 e 	 	an	enormous	amount	of	money	from	the	u.s.	and	the	european	 government 	 s 	 	to	build	 school 	 s 	 	and	 clinic 	 s 	 	,	are	 some 	 what 	 	 dis 	 inc 	 lined 	 	to	 challeng 	 e 	 	the	idea	that	afghanistan	is	an	existential	threat	to	global	security	.
they	're	 worri 	 ed 	 	,	in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	that	if	 any 	 body 	 	 believ 	 es 	 	that	it	was	n't	 s 	 uch 	 	a	threat	--	oxfam	,	 s 	 ave 	 	the	children	would	n't	get	the	money	to	build	 the 	 ir 	 	 hospital 	 s 	 	and	 school 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	to	confront	a	general	with	 med 	 al 	 s 	 	on	his	chest	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	for	a	 politic 	 ian 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	 af 	 raid 	 	that	 man 	 y 	 	 live 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	lost	in	 va 	 in 	 	.
you	feel	deep	,	deep	guilt	.
you	 exagge 	 rate 	 	your	 fear 	 s 	 	,
and	you	're	 terr 	 ified 	 	about	the	 humil 	 iation 	 	of	defeat	.
what	is	the	solution	to	 th 	 is 	 	?
well	the	solution	to	 th 	 is 	 	is	we	need	to	find	a	way	that	people	like	michael	semple	,	or	 t 	 hose 	 	other	people	,	who	are	 tell 	 ing 	 	the	truth	,	who	know	the	country	,	who	've	 s 	 pent 	 	30	 year 	 s 	 	on	the	ground	--	and	most	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	of	all	,	the	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	component	of	 th 	 is 	 	--	afghans	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	who	understand	what	is	going	on	.
we	need	to	 some 	 how 	 	get	 the 	 ir 	 	 mess 	 age 	 	to	the	 policy 	 makers 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	to	do	 be 	 cause 	 	of	our	 structure 	 s 	 	.
the	first	thing	we	need	to	change	is	the	 structure 	 s 	 	of	our	government	.
 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 ad 	 ly 	 	,	our	foreign	 service 	 s 	 	,	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	,	the	 militar 	 y 	 	in	these	 count 	 ries 	 	have	 ver 	 y 	 	little	idea	of	what	's	going	on	.
the	average	british	soldier	is	on	a	tour	of	 on 	 ly 	 	six	 month 	 s 	 	;	italian	 soldier 	 s 	 	,	on	 tour 	 s 	 	of	four	 month 	 s 	 	;	the	american	 militar 	 y 	 	,	on	 tour 	 s 	 	of	12	 month 	 s 	 	.
 diplomat 	 s 	 	are	 lock 	 ed 	 	in	 emb 	 ass 	 y 	 	 com 	 pound 	 s 	 	.
when	they	go	out	,	they	travel	in	these	 cur 	 ious 	 	 arm 	 or 	 ed 	 	 vehicle 	 s 	 
with	these	 some 	 what 	 	 threaten 	 ing 	 	security	 team 	 s 	 	who	ready	24	 hour 	 s 	 	in	advance	who	say	you	can	 on 	 ly 	 	stay	on	the	ground	for	an	hour	.
in	the	british	 emb 	 ass 	 y 	 	in	afghanistan	in	2008	,	an	 emb 	 ass 	 y 	 	of	350	people	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	three	people	who	could	speak	dari	,	the	main	language	of	afghanistan	,	at	a	 de 	 cent 	 	level	.
and	there	was	not	a	single	pashto	speaker	.
in	the	afghan	section	in	london	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	 govern 	 ing 	 	afghan	policy	on	the	ground	,	i	was	told	last	year	that	there	was	not	a	single	staff	member	of	the	foreign	 off 	 ice 	 	in	that	section	who	had	ever	 serv 	 ed 	 	on	a	 post 	 ing 	 	in	afghanistan	.
so	we	need	to	change	that	 institution 	 al 	 	culture	.
and	i	could	make	the	same	 point 	 s 	 	about	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	and	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	.
 second 	 ly 	 	,	we	need	to	aim	off	of	the	 optim 	 ism 	 	of	the	 general 	 s 	 	.	we	need	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	we	're	a	little	bit	suspicious	,	that	we	understand	that	 optim 	 ism 	 	is	in	the	dna	of	the	 militar 	 y 	 	,
that	we	do	n't	respond	to	it	with	 quit 	 e 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	 ala 	 cr 	 ity 	 	.
and	 third 	 ly 	 	,	we	need	to	have	some	 humil 	 ity 	 	.
we	need	to	begin	from	the	position	that	our	knowledge	,	our	power	,	our	 leg 	 i 	 timacy 	 	is	 limit 	 ed 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	that	intervention	around	the	world	is	a	disaster	.
it	is	n't	.
bosnia	and	kosovo	 we 	 re 	 	signal	 success 	 es 	 	,	great	 success 	 es 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	when	you	go	to	bosnia	it	is	 al 	 most 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	what	we	saw	in	the	early	1990s	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
it	's	 al 	 most 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	to	 believ 	 e 	 	the	progress	we	've	made	since	1994	.
 refuge 	 e 	 	return	,	which	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	high	commission	for	 refuge 	 es 	 	thought	would	be	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 un 	 like 	 ly 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 large 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.

but	you	need	to	look	at	 con 	 text 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	've	lost	in	afghanistan	and	 ir 	 aq 	 	.
you	need	to	understand	that	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 place 	 s 	 	what	 re 	 ally 	 	 matter 	 ed 	 	was	,	 first 	 ly 	 	,	the	role	of	tudman	and	milosevic	in	coming	to	the	 agree 	 ment 	 	,	and	then	the	fact	 t 	 hose 	 	men	went	,	that	the	 region 	 al 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	 improv 	 ed 	 	,	that	the	european	 un 	 ion 	 	could	 off 	 er 	 	bosnia	 some 	 thing 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	:	the	chance	to	be	part	of	a	new	thing	,	a	new	club	,	a	chance	to	join	 some 	 thing 	 	 big 	 ger 	 	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	we	need	to	understand	that	in	bosnia	and	kosovo	,	a	lot	of	the	secret	of	what	we	did	,	a	lot	of	the	secret	of	our	success	,	was	our	 humil 	 ity 	 	--	was	the	 tent 	 ative 	 	nature	of	our	 engage 	 ment 	 	.
we	 critic 	 ized 	 	people	a	lot	in	bosnia	for	 be 	 ing 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 s 	 low 	 	to	take	on	war	 criminal 	 s 	 	.
we	 critic 	 ized 	 	them	for	 be 	 ing 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 s 	 low 	 	to	return	 refuge 	 es 	 	.
but	that	 s 	 low 	 ness 	 	,	that	caution	,	the	fact	that	 p 	 resident 	 	clinton	 initi 	 ally 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	that	american	 troop 	 s 	 	would	 on 	 ly 	 	be	 deploy 	 ed 	 	for	a	year	,	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	a	strength	,	and	it	 help 	 ed 	 	us	to	put	our	 prior 	 ities 	 	right	.
one	of	the	 s 	 add 	 est 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	about	our	 involve 	 ment 	 	in	afghanistan	is	that	we	've	got	our	 prior 	 ities 	 	out	of	sync	.
we	're	not	 match 	 ing 	 	our	 resource 	 s 	 	to	our	 prior 	 ities 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	if	what	we	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	is	 terror 	 ism 	 	,	pakistan	is	far	more	 import 	 ant 	 	than	afghanistan	.
if	what	we	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	is	 region 	 al 	 	 st 	 ability 	 	,	egypt	is	far	more	 import 	 ant 	 	.
if	what	we	're	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	is	poverty	and	 develop 	 ment 	 	,	sub	-	saharan	africa	is	far	more	 import 	 ant 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	that	afghanistan	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	,	but	that	it	's	one	of	40	 count 	 ries 	 	in	the	world	with	which	we	need	to	engage	.
so	if	i	can	finish	with	a	metaphor	for	intervention	,	what	we	need	to	think	of	is	 some 	 thing 	 	like	mountain	 rescu 	 e 	 	.
why	mountain	 rescu 	 e 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	when	people	talk	about	intervention	,	they	imagine	that	some	scientific	 theor 	 y 	 	--	the	rand	corporation	 go 	 es 	 	around	 count 	 ing 	 	43	previous	insurgencies	producing	 mathematic 	 al 	 	formula	 say 	 ing 	 	you	need	one	trained	counter	-	insurgent	for	every	20	 member 	 s 	 	of	the	population	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	wrong	way	of	looking	at	it	.
you	need	to	look	at	it	in	the	way	that	you	look	at	mountain	 rescu 	 e 	 	.
when	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	mountain	 rescu 	 e 	 	,	you	do	n't	take	a	 doctor 	 ate 	 	in	mountain	 rescu 	 e 	 	,	you	look	for	 some 	 body 	 	who	 know 	 s 	 	the	 terra 	 in 	 	.
it	's	about	 con 	 text 	 	.
you	understand	that	you	can	 prep 	 are 	 	,	but	the	amount	of	 pre 	 par 	 ation 	 	you	can	do	is	 limit 	 ed 	 	--
you	can	take	some	water	,	you	can	have	a	map	,	you	can	have	a	pack	.
but	what	 re 	 ally 	 	 matter 	 s 	 	is	two	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 problem 	 s 	 	--	 problem 	 s 	 	that	occur	on	the	mountain	which	you	could	n't	 anticip 	 ate 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	ice	on	a	 slop 	 e 	 	,	but	which	you	can	get	around	,	and	 problem 	 s 	 	which	you	could	n't	 anticip 	 ate 	 	and	which	you	ca	n't	get	around	,	like	a	sudden	 blizz 	 ard 	 	or	an	 avalanch 	 e 	 	or	a	change	in	the	weather	.
and	the	key	to	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	guide	who	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	on	that	mountain	,	in	every	temperature	,	at	every	period	--
a	guide	who	,	above	all	,	 know 	 s 	 	when	to	turn	back	,	who	 do 	 es 	 	n't	press	on	 relent 	 lessly 	 	when	 condition 	 s 	 	turn	against	them	.
what	we	look	for	in	 fire 	 men 	 	,	in	 climb 	 ers 	 	,	in	 police 	 men 	 	,	and	what	we	should	look	for	in	intervention	,	is	intelligent	risk	 taker 	 s 	 	--	not	people	who	plunge	blind	off	a	cliff	,	not	people	who	jump	 in 	 to 	 	a	 burn 	 ing 	 	room	,	but	who	weigh	 the 	 ir 	 	 risk 	 s 	 	,	weigh	 the 	 ir 	 	 respons 	 ibilities 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	worst	thing	we	have	 d 	 one 	 	in	afghanistan	is	 th 	 is 	 	idea	that	failure	is	not	an	option	.
it	 make 	 s 	 	failure	 in 	 visible 	 	,	 in 	 conceiv 	 able 	 	and	 inevit 	 able 	 	.
and	if	we	can	resist	 th 	 is 	 	crazy	slogan	,	we	 s 	 hall 	 	discover	--	in	egypt	,	in	syria	,	in	libya	,	and	 any 	 where 	 	else	we	go	in	the	world	--	that	if	we	can	often	do	much	less	than	we	pretend	,	we	can	do	much	more	than	we	fear	.

bruno	giussani	:	rory	,	you	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	libya	at	the	end	.
just	 brief 	 ly 	 	,	what	's	your	take	on	the	current	 event 	 s 	 	there	and	the	intervention	?
rory	stewart	:	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	i	think	libya	 pose 	 s 	 	the	classic	problem	.
the	problem	in	libya	is	that	we	are	 al 	 ways 	 	 push 	 ing 	 	for	the	black	or	white	.
we	imagine	there	are	 on 	 ly 	 	two	 choice 	 s 	 	:	either	full	 engage 	 ment 	 	and	troop	 deploy 	 ment 	 	or	total	 isol 	 ation 	 	.
and	we	are	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 tempt 	 ed 	 	up	to	our	neck	.
we	put	our	 to 	 es 	 	in	and	we	go	up	to	our	neck	.
what	we	should	have	 d 	 one 	 	in	libya	is	we	should	have	 s 	 tuck 	 	to	the	u.n.	 re 	 solution 	 	.
we	should	have	 limit 	 ed 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 strict 	 ly 	 	to	the	 protect 	 ion 	 	of	the	 civil 	 ian 	 	population	in	benghazi	.
we	could	have	 d 	 one 	 	that	.
we	set	up	a	no	-	fly	zone	 with 	 in 	 	48	 hour 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	gaddafi	had	no	 plane 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	48	 hour 	 s 	 	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	which	,	we	've	 allow 	 ed 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	be	 tempt 	 ed 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	regime	change	.
in	 do 	 ing 	 	so	,	we	've	 destroy 	 ed 	 	our	 cr 	 ed 	 ibility 	 	with	the	security	council	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	to	get	a	 re 	 solution 	 	on	syria	,	and	we	're	setting	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	up	 aga 	 in 	 	for	failure	.
once	more	,	 humil 	 ity 	 	,	 limit 	 s 	 	,	 honest 	 y 	 	,	realistic	 expect 	 ations 	 	and	we	could	have	 achiev 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	to	be	proud	of	.
