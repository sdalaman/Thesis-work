thank	you	for	 be 	 ing 	 	here	.
and	i	say	``	thank	you	for	 be 	 ing 	 	here	``	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	silent	for	17	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	the	first	 word 	 s 	 	that	i	spoke	 we 	 re 	 	in	washington	,	d.c.	,	on	the	20th	 annivers 	 ary 	 	of	earth	day	.
and	my	family	and	 friend 	 s 	 	had	 gather 	 ed 	 	there	to	hear	me	speak	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	thank	you	for	 be 	 ing 	 	here	.	``
my	mother	,	out	in	the	audience	,	she	 jump 	 ed 	 	up	,	``	hallelujah	,	johnny	's	 talk 	 ing 	 	!	``
imagine	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	quiet	for	17	 year 	 s 	 	and	your	mother	was	out	in	the	audience	,	say	.
my	dad	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	``	that	's	one	``	--	i	'll	explain	that	.
but	i	 turn 	 ed 	 	around	 be 	 cause 	 	i	did	n't	 recogn 	 ize 	 	where	my	voice	was	coming	from	.
i	had	n't	heard	my	voice	in	17	 year 	 s 	 	,	so	i	 turn 	 ed 	 	around	and	i	 look 	 ed 	 	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	god	,	who	's	 say 	 ing 	 	what	i	'm	 think 	 ing 	 	?	``
and	then	i	 real 	 ized 	 	it	was	me	,	you	know	,	and	i	kind	of	 laugh 	 ed 	 	.
and	i	could	see	my	father	:	``	 yea 	 h 	 	,	he	 re 	 ally 	 	is	crazy	.	``
well	,	i	want	to	take	you	on	 th 	 is 	 	journey	.
and	the	journey	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	is	a	metaphor	for	all	of	our	 journey 	 s 	 	.
even	 th 	 ough 	 	 th 	 is 	 	one	is	kind	of	 un 	 usual 	 	,	i	want	you	to	think	about	your	own	journey	.
my	journey	 beg 	 an 	 	in	1971	when	i	 witness 	 ed 	 	two	oil	 tank 	 ers 	 	collide	 be 	 neath 	 	the	 gold 	 en 	 	gate	,	and	a	half	a	million	 gallon 	 s 	 	of	oil	 s 	 pill 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 ba 	 y 	 	.
it	 disturb 	 ed 	 	me	so	much	that	i	 decide 	 d 	 	that	i	was	going	to	give	up	 rid 	 ing 	 	and	 driv 	 ing 	 	in	 motor 	 ized 	 	 vehicle 	 s 	 	.
that	's	a	big	thing	in	california	.
and	it	was	a	big	thing	in	my	little	community	of	point	reyes	station	in	inverness	,	california	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	 we 	 re 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	about	350	people	there	in	the	winter	--	 th 	 is 	 	was	back	in	'71	now	.
and	so	when	i	came	in	and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 walk 	 ing 	 	around	,	people	--	they	just	 k 	 new 	 	what	was	going	on	.
and	people	would	drive	up	next	to	me	and	say	,	``	john	,	what	are	you	 do 	 ing 	 	?	``
and	i	'd	say	,	``	well	,	i	'm	 walk 	 ing 	 	for	the	environment	.	``
and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	you	're	 walk 	 ing 	 	to	make	us	look	bad	,	right	?
you	're	 walk 	 ing 	 	to	make	us	feel	bad	.	``
and	 may 	 be 	 	there	was	some	truth	to	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	thought	that	if	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 walk 	 ing 	 	,	 every 	 one 	 	would	follow	.
 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	oil	,	 every 	 body 	 	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	the	 poll 	 l 	 ution 	 	.
and	so	i	 argu 	 ed 	 	with	people	about	that	,	i	 argu 	 ed 	 	and	i	 argu 	 ed 	 	.
i	 call 	 ed 	 	my	 parent 	 s 	 	up	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	've	 give 	 n 	 	up	 rid 	 ing 	 	and	 driv 	 ing 	 	in	 car 	 s 	 	.	``
my	dad	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	why	did	n't	you	do	that	when	you	 we 	 re 	 	16	?	``
i	did	n't	know	about	the	environment	then	.
they	're	back	in	philadelphia	.
and	so	i	told	my	mother	,	``	i	'm	happy	 th 	 ough 	 	,	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	happy	.	``
she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	happy	,	son	,	you	would	n't	have	to	say	it	.	``
 mother 	 s 	 	are	like	that	.
and	so	,	on	my	27th	 birth 	 day 	 	i	 decide 	 d 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 argu 	 ed 	 	so	much	and	i	talk	so	much	,	that	i	was	going	to	stop	 s 	 peaking 	 	for	just	one	day	--	one	day	--	to	give	it	a	rest	.
and	so	i	did	.
i	got	up	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	and	i	did	n't	say	a	word	.
and	i	have	to	tell	you	,	it	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	moving	experience	,	 be 	 cause 	 	for	the	first	time	,	i	 beg 	 an 	 	 listen 	 ing 	 	--	in	a	long	time	.
and	what	i	heard	,	it	kind	of	 disturb 	 ed 	 	me	.
 be 	 cause 	 	what	i	used	to	do	,	when	i	thought	i	was	 listen 	 ing 	 	,	was	i	would	listen	just	 en 	 ough 	 	to	hear	what	people	had	to	say	and	think	that	i	could	--	i	 k 	 new 	 	what	they	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	say	,	and	so	i	 stop 	 ped 	 	 listen 	 ing 	 	.
and	in	my	mind	,	i	just	kind	of	 rac 	 ed 	 	 a 	 head 	 	and	thought	of	what	i	was	going	to	say	back	,	while	they	 we 	 re 	 	still	 finish 	 ing 	 	up	.
and	then	i	would	launch	in	.
well	,	that	just	 end 	 ed 	 	communication	.
so	on	 th 	 is 	 	first	day	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	 listen 	 ed 	 	.
and	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 ad 	 	for	me	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	for	 t 	 hose 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	i	had	not	 be 	 en 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	.
i	was	27.	i	thought	i	 k 	 new 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	.
i	did	n't	.
and	so	i	 decide 	 d 	 	i	'd	better	do	 th 	 is 	 	for	 an 	 other 	 	day	,	and	 an 	 other 	 	day	,	and	 an 	 other 	 	day	 un 	 til 	 	 final 	 ly 	 	,	i	 promise 	 d 	 	 my 	 self 	 	for	a	year	i	would	keep	quiet	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	more	and	more	and	i	 need 	 ed 	 	to	learn	more	.
so	for	a	year	i	 s 	 aid 	 	i	would	keep	quiet	,	and	then	on	my	 birth 	 day 	 	i	would	 re 	 assess 	 	what	i	had	 learn 	 ed 	 	and	 may 	 be 	 	i	would	talk	 aga 	 in 	 	.
well	,	that	 last 	 ed 	 	17	 year 	 s 	 	.
now	 dur 	 ing 	 	that	time	--	 t 	 hose 	 	17	 year 	 s 	 	--	i	 walk 	 ed 	 	and	i	 play 	 ed 	 	the	banjo	and	i	 paint 	 ed 	 	and	i	wrote	in	my	journal	,	and	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	 stud 	 y 	 	the	environment	by	 read 	 ing 	 	 book 	 s 	 	.
and	i	 decide 	 d 	 	that	i	was	going	to	go	to	school	.	so	i	did	.
i	 walk 	 ed 	 	up	to	ashland	,	oregon	,	where	they	 we 	 re 	 	 off 	 er 	 ing 	 	an	 environment 	 al 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	degree	.
it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	500	 mile 	 s 	 	.
and	i	went	 in 	 to 	 	the	registrar	's	 off 	 ice 	 	and	--
``	what	,	what	,	what	?	``
i	had	a	 news 	 paper 	 	 clip 	 ping 	 	.
``	oh	,	so	you	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	go	to	school	here	?
you	do	n't	.	.	.	?
we	have	a	special	program	for	you	.	``	they	did	.
and	in	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	 graduate 	 d 	 	with	my	first	degree	--	a	bachelor	's	degree	.
and	my	father	came	out	,	he	was	so	proud	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	listen	,	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	proud	of	you	son	,	but	what	are	you	going	to	do	with	a	bachelor	's	degree	?
you	do	n't	ride	in	 car 	 s 	 	,	you	do	n't	talk	--	you	're	going	to	have	to	do	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.	``
i	 hunch 	 ed 	 	my	shoulder	,	i	 pick 	 ed 	 	my	 back 	 pack 	 	up	 aga 	 in 	 	and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 walk 	 ing 	 	.
i	 walk 	 ed 	 	all	the	way	up	to	port	townsend	,	washington	,	where	i	built	a	 wood 	 en 	 	boat	,	 rod 	 e 	 	it	 a 	 cross 	 	puget	sound
and	 walk 	 ed 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	washington	[	to	]	idaho	and	down	to	missoula	,	montana	.
i	had	written	the	university	of	montana	two	 year 	 s 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	i	'd	like	to	go	to	school	there	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	i	'd	be	there	in	about	two	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	i	was	there	.	i	 show 	 ed 	 	up	in	two	 year 	 s 	 	and	they	--	i	tell	 th 	 is 	 	story	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 re 	 ally 	 	 help 	 ed 	 	me	.
there	are	two	 st 	 ories 	 	in	montana	.
the	first	story	is	i	did	n't	have	any	money	--	that	's	a	sign	i	used	a	lot	.
and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	do	n't	worry	about	that	.	``
the	director	of	the	program	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	come	back	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	.	``
he	 g 	 ave 	 	me	150	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	register	for	one	credit	.
you	're	going	to	go	to	south	america	,	are	n't	you	?	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	--	 river 	 s 	 	and	 lake 	 s 	 	,	the	 hydro 	 logical 	 	 system 	 s 	 	,	south	america	.
so	i	did	that	.
he	came	back	;	he	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	``	ok	john	,	now	that	you	've	 register 	 ed 	 	for	that	one	credit	,	you	can	have	a	key	to	an	 off 	 ice 	 	,	you	can	 matric 	 ulate 	 	--	you	're	 matric 	 ul 	 ating 	 	,	so	you	can	use	the	library	.
and	what	we	're	going	to	do	is	,	we	're	going	to	have	all	of	the	 professor 	 s 	 	allow	you	to	go	to	class	.	they	're	going	to	 s 	 ave 	 	your	grade	,	and	when	we	figure	out	how	to	get	you	the	rest	of	the	money	,	then	you	can	register	for	that	class	and	they	'll	give	you	the	grade	.	``
 w 	 ow 	 	,	they	do	n't	do	that	in	graduate	 school 	 s 	 	,	i	do	n't	think	.
but	i	use	that	story	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	help	me	.
they	saw	that	i	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	environment	,	and	they	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	help	me	 a 	 long 	 	the	way	.
and	 dur 	 ing 	 	that	time	,	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	taught	 class 	 es 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 s 	 peaking 	 	.
i	had	13	 student 	 s 	 	when	i	first	 walk 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	class	.	i	 explain 	 ed 	 	,	with	a	friend	who	could	interpret	my	sign	language	,	that	i	was	john	francis	,	i	was	 walk 	 ing 	 	around	the	world	,	i	did	n't	talk	and	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	last	time	 th 	 is 	 	person	's	going	to	be	here	 interpret 	 ing 	 	for	me	.
all	the	 student 	 s 	 	 s 	 at 	 	around	and	they	went	...
i	could	see	they	 we 	 re 	 	looking	for	the	schedule	,	to	see	when	they	could	get	out	.
they	had	to	take	that	class	with	me	.
two	 week 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	 every 	 one 	 	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	 in 	 to 	 	our	class	.
and	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	in	that	class	--	 be 	 cause 	 	i	would	do	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	...
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	all	 gather 	 ed 	 	around	,	going	,	``	what	's	he	 try 	 ing 	 	to	say	?	``
``	i	do	n't	know	,	i	think	he	's	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	clear	cutting	.	``	``	 yea 	 h 	 	,	clear	cutting	.	``
``	no	,	no	,	no	,	that	's	not	clear	cutting	,	that	's	--	he	's	using	a	 hand 	 saw 	 	.	``
``	well	,	you	ca	n't	 clear 	 cut 	 	with	a	.	.	.	``
``	 y 	 es 	 	,	you	can	clear	cut	.	.	.	``
``	no	,	i	think	he	's	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 select 	 ive 	 	 forest 	 ry 	 	.	``
now	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	 discuss 	 ion 	 	class	and	we	 we 	 re 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	 discuss 	 ion 	 	.
i	just	 back 	 ed 	 	out	of	that	,	you	know	,	and	i	just	kind	of	 ke 	 pt 	 	the	 fist 	 s 	 	from	 fly 	 ing 	 	.
but	what	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	was	that	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	i	would	make	a	sign	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	 absolute 	 ly 	 	did	not	mean	,	but	i	should	have	.
and	so	what	came	to	me	is	,	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	a	teacher	and	you	 we 	 re 	 	 teach 	 ing 	 	,	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 learn 	 ing 	 	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 teach 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.
and	so	i	went	on	.
my	dad	came	out	to	see	me	graduate	and	,	you	know	,	i	did	the	deal	,	and	my	father	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	proud	of	you	son	,	but	...	``
you	know	what	went	on	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	've	got	to	start	 rid 	 ing 	 	and	 driv 	 ing 	 	and	start	 talk 	 ing 	 	.
what	are	you	going	to	do	with	a	master	's	degree	?	``
i	 hunch 	 ed 	 	my	shoulder	,	i	got	my	 back 	 pack 	 	and	i	went	on	to	the	university	of	wisconsin	.
i	 s 	 pent 	 	two	 year 	 s 	 	there	writing	on	oil	 s 	 pill 	 s 	 	.
no	one	was	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	oil	 s 	 pill 	 s 	 	.
but	 some 	 thing 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	--	exxon	valdez	.
and	i	was	the	 on 	 ly 	 	one	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	writing	on	oil	 s 	 pill 	 s 	 	.
my	dad	came	out	 aga 	 in 	 	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	do	n't	know	how	you	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	son	--	i	mean	,	you	do	n't	ride	in	 car 	 s 	 	,	you	do	n't	talk	.
my	sister	 s 	 aid 	 	 may 	 be 	 	i	should	 leav 	 e 	 	you	 al 	 one 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	seem	to	be	 do 	 ing 	 	a	lot	better	when	you	're	not	 say 	 ing 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	.	``
well	,	i	put	on	my	 back 	 pack 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
i	put	my	banjo	on	and	i	 walk 	 ed 	 	all	the	way	to	the	east	coast	,	put	my	foot	in	the	atlantic	ocean	--	it	was	seven	 year 	 s 	 	and	one	day	it	took	me	to	walk	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
and	on	earth	day	,	1990	--	the	20th	 annivers 	 ary 	 	of	earth	day	--	that	's	when	i	 beg 	 an 	 	to	speak	.
and	that	's	why	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	thank	you	for	 be 	 ing 	 	here	.	``
 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	sort	of	like	that	tree	in	the	forest	 fall 	 ing 	 	;	and	if	there	's	no	one	there	to	hear	,	 do 	 es 	 	it	 re 	 ally 	 	make	a	sound	?
and	i	'm	 thank 	 ing 	 	you	,	and	i	'm	 thank 	 ing 	 	my	family	 be 	 cause 	 	they	had	come	to	hear	me	speak	.
and	that	's	communication	.
and	they	 al 	 so 	 	taught	me	about	 listen 	 ing 	 	--	that	they	 listen 	 ed 	 	to	me	.
and	it	's	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	came	out	of	the	silence	,	the	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	each	other	.
 re 	 ally 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	--	we	need	to	listen	to	each	other	.
well	,	my	journey	 ke 	 pt 	 	going	on	.
my	dad	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	that	's	one	,	``	and	i	still	did	n't	let	that	go	.
i	 work 	 ed 	 	for	the	coastguard	,	was	made	a	u.n.	 good 	 will 	 	ambassador	.
i	wrote	 regulat 	 ions 	 	for	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	--	i	mean	,	i	wrote	oil	 s 	 pill 	 	 regulat 	 ions 	 	.
20	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	if	 some 	 one 	 	had	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	``	john	,	do	you	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	?	``
``	 yea 	 h 	 	,	i	want	to	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	.	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	you	just	start	 walk 	 ing 	 	east	;	get	out	of	your	car	and	just	start	 walk 	 ing 	 	east	.	``
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	 walk 	 ed 	 	off	a	little	bit	,	they	'd	say	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	,	and	shut	up	,	too	.	``
``	you	're	going	to	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	,	 bud 	 dy 	 	.	``
how	could	that	be	,	how	could	that	be	?
how	could	 do 	 ing 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	a	simple	thing	like	 walk 	 ing 	 	and	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	?
well	,	my	time	at	the	coast	guard	was	a	 re 	 ally 	 	good	time	.
and	after	that	--	i	 on 	 ly 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	one	year	--	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	that	's	 en 	 ough 	 	.	one	year	's	 en 	 ough 	 	for	me	to	do	that	.	``
i	got	on	a	 sail 	 boat 	 	and	i	 s 	 ailed 	 	down	to	the	caribbean	,	and	 walk 	 ed 	 	through	all	of	the	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	,	and	to	venezuela	.
and	you	know	,	i	 for 	 got 	 	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	,	which	is	why	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	,	which	i	have	to	tell	you	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	had	 stud 	 ied 	 	environment	.	i	'd	 stud 	 ied 	 	environment	at	 th 	 is 	 	 form 	 al 	 	level	,	but	there	was	 th 	 is 	 	 inform 	 al 	 	level	.
and	the	 inform 	 al 	 	level	--	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	about	people	,	and	what	we	do	and	how	we	are	.
and	environment	 change 	 d 	 	from	just	 be 	 ing 	 	about	 tree 	 s 	 	and	 bird 	 s 	 	and	 en 	 danger 	 ed 	 	species	to	 be 	 ing 	 	about	how	we	 treat 	 ed 	 	each	other	.
 be 	 cause 	 	if	we	are	the	environment	,	then	all	we	need	to	do	is	look	around	us	and	see	how	we	treat	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	how	we	treat	each	other	.
and	so	that	's	the	 mess 	 age 	 	that	i	had	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	i	'm	going	to	have	to	spread	that	 mess 	 age 	 	.	``
and	i	got	in	my	 sail 	 boat 	 	,	 s 	 ailed 	 	all	the	way	through	the	caribbean	--	it	was	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	my	 sail 	 boat 	 	,	i	kind	of	 work 	 ed 	 	on	that	boat	--	got	to	venezuela	and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 walk 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	last	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	story	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	how	i	got	here	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	still	did	n't	ride	in	 motor 	 ized 	 	 vehicle 	 s 	 	.
i	was	 walk 	 ing 	 	through	el	dorado	--	it	's	a	 pri 	 son 	 	town	,	famous	 pri 	 son 	 	,	or	 in 	 famous 	 	 pri 	 son 	 	--	in	venezuela	,	and	i	do	n't	know	what	 possess 	 ed 	 	me	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	was	not	like	me	.
there	i	am	,	 walk 	 ing 	 	past	the	guard	gate	and	the	guard	 stop 	 s 	 	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	pasaporte	,	pasaporte	,	``	and	with	an	m	16	 point 	 ed 	 	at	me	.
and	i	 look 	 ed 	 	at	him	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 pass 	 port 	 	,	huh	?	i	do	n't	need	to	show	you	my	 pass 	 port 	 	.	it	's	in	the	back	of	my	pack	.
i	'm	dr.	francis	;	i	'm	a	u.n.	ambassador	and	i	'm	 walk 	 ing 	 	around	the	world	.	``
and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 walk 	 ing 	 	off	.
what	 possess 	 ed 	 	me	to	say	 th 	 is 	 	thing	?
the	road	 turn 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	jungle	.
i	did	n't	get	shot	.
and	i	got	to	--	i	start	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	free	at	last	--	thank	god	 al 	 might 	 y 	 	,	i	'm	free	at	last	.	``
``	what	was	that	about	,	``	i	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	.	what	was	that	about	?
it	took	me	100	 mile 	 s 	 	to	figure	out	that	,	in	my	heart	,	in	me	,	i	had	 be 	 come 	 	a	prisoner	.
i	was	a	prisoner	and	i	 need 	 ed 	 	to	 es 	 cape 	 	.
the	 pri 	 son 	 	that	i	was	in	was	the	fact	that	i	did	not	drive	or	use	 motor 	 ized 	 	 vehicle 	 s 	 	.
now	how	could	that	be	?
 be 	 cause 	 	when	i	 start 	 ed 	 	,	it	 seem 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	appropriate	to	me	not	to	use	 motor 	 ized 	 	 vehicle 	 s 	 	.
but	the	thing	that	was	different	was	that	every	 birth 	 day 	 	,	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	 my 	 self 	 	about	silence	,	but	i	never	 ask 	 ed 	 	 my 	 self 	 	about	my	decision	to	just	use	my	feet	.
i	had	no	idea	i	was	going	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	u.n.	ambassador	.
i	had	no	idea	i	would	have	a	ph.d	.
and	so	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	i	had	a	 respons 	 ibility 	 	to	more	than	just	me	,	and	that	i	was	going	to	have	to	change	.
you	know	,	we	can	do	it	.
i	was	going	to	have	to	change	.
and	i	was	 af 	 raid 	 	to	change	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	so	used	to	the	guy	who	 on 	 ly 	 	just	 walk 	 ed 	 	.
i	was	so	used	to	that	person	that	i	did	n't	want	to	stop	.
i	did	n't	know	who	i	would	be	if	i	 change 	 d 	 	.
but	i	know	i	 need 	 ed 	 	to	.
i	know	i	 need 	 ed 	 	to	change	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	would	be	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	that	i	could	be	here	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	i	know	that	a	lot	of	 time 	 s 	 	we	find	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	place	where	we	've	gotten	to	,	but	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	place	for	us	to	go	.
and	we	kind	of	have	to	 leav 	 e 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	the	security	of	who	we	've	 be 	 come 	 	,	and	go	to	the	place	of	who	we	are	 be 	 coming 	 	.
and	so	,	i	want	to	 encourag 	 e 	 	you	to	go	to	that	next	place	,	to	let	 your 	 self 	 	out	of	any	 pri 	 son 	 	that	you	might	find	 your 	 self 	 	in	,	 a 	 s 	 	 comfort 	 able 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	may	be	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	now	.
we	have	to	change	now	.
 a 	 s 	 	our	 form 	 er 	 	vice	 p 	 resident 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	we	have	to	 be 	 come 	 	 activist 	 s 	 	.
so	if	my	voice	can	touch	you	,	if	my	 action 	 s 	 	can	touch	you	,	if	my	 be 	 ing 	 	here	can	touch	you	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	let	it	be	.
and	i	know	that	all	of	you	have	 touch 	 ed 	 	me	while	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	here	.
so	,	let	's	go	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	world	and	take	 th 	 is 	 	 car 	 ing 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	love	,	 th 	 is 	 	respect	that	we	've	 show 	 n 	 	each	other	right	here	at	ted	,	and	take	 th 	 is 	 	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	world	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	are	the	environment	,	and	how	we	treat	each	other	is	 re 	 ally 	 	how	we	're	going	to	treat	the	environment	.
so	i	want	to	thank	you	for	 be 	 ing 	 	here	and	i	want	to	end	 th 	 is 	 	in	five	 second 	 s 	 	of	silence	.
thank	you	.
