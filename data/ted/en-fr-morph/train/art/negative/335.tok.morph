my	mission	in	life	since	i	was	a	kid	was	,	and	is	,	to	take	the	rest	of	you	 in 	 to 	 	space	.
it	's	 dur 	 ing 	 	our	 life 	 time 	 	that	we	're	going	to	take	the	earth	,	take	the	people	of	earth	and	 transit 	 ion 	 	off	,	 permanent 	 ly 	 	.	and	that	's	 excit 	 ing 	 	.
in	fact	,	i	think	it	is	a	moral	 imper 	 ative 	 	that	we	open	the	space	 front 	 ier 	 	.
you	know	,	it	's	the	first	time	that	we	're	going	to	have	a	chance	to	have	planetary	 red 	 un 	 d 	 ancy 	 	,
a	chance	to	,	if	you	would	,	back	up	the	 bio 	 sphere 	 	.
and	if	you	think	about	space	,	 every 	 thing 	 	we	hold	of	value	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	--	 metal 	 s 	 	and	 mineral 	 s 	 	and	real	 e 	 state 	 	and	energy	--	is	in	infinite	 quant 	 ities 	 	in	space	.
in	fact	,	the	earth	is	a	crumb	in	a	 super 	 market 	 	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	 resource 	 s 	 	.
the	 analog 	 y 	 	for	me	is	alaska	.	you	know	,	we	 b 	 ought 	 	alaska	.
we	americans	 b 	 ought 	 	alaska	in	the	1850s	.	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	seward	's	 fol 	 ly 	 	.
we	 valu 	 ed 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	the	number	of	seal	 pel 	 ts 	 	we	could	kill	.
and	then	we	 discover 	 ed 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	--	gold	and	oil	and	 fish 	 ing 	 	and	timber	--	and	it	 be 	 came 	 	,	you	know	,	a	trillion	-	dollar	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	and	now	we	take	our	 honey 	 moon 	 s 	 	there	.	the	same	thing	will	happen	in	space	.
we	are	on	the	 ver 	 ge 	 	of	the	 great 	 est 	 	exploration	that	the	human	race	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	known	.
we	explore	for	three	 reason 	 s 	 	,	the	 weak 	 est 	 	of	which	is	curiosity	.
you	know	,	it	's	funded	nasa	's	budget	up	 un 	 til 	 	now	.
some	 image 	 s 	 	from	mars	,	1997	.
in	fact	,	i	think	in	the	next	decade	,	 with 	 out 	 	any	question	,	we	will	discover	life	on	mars	and	find	that	it	is	 liter 	 ally 	 	 ubiqu 	 it 	 ous 	 	under	the	 s 	 oil 	 s 	 	and	different	 part 	 s 	 	of	that	planet	.
the	 strong 	 er 	 	 motiv 	 ator 	 	,	the	much	 strong 	 er 	 	 motiv 	 ator 	 	,	is	fear	.
it	drove	us	to	the	moon	.	we	--	 liter 	 ally 	 	in	fear	--	with	the	soviet	 un 	 ion 	 	 rac 	 ed 	 	to	the	moon	.	and	we	have	these	huge	 rock 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	killer	-	sized	 rock 	 s 	 	in	the	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	or	 million 	 s 	 	out	there	,	and	while	the	 prob 	 ability 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	small	,	the	impact	,	 figur 	 ed 	 	in	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	of	one	of	these	hitting	the	earth	is	so	huge	that	to	 s 	 pend 	 	a	small	fraction	looking	,	 search 	 ing 	 	,	 pre 	 par 	 ing 	 	to	defend	,	is	not	 un 	 reason 	 able 	 	.
and	of	course	,	the	third	 motiv 	 ator 	 	,	one	near	and	dear	to	my	heart	 a 	 s 	 	an	entrepreneur	,	is	wealth	.
in	fact	,	the	 great 	 est 	 	wealth	.	if	you	think	about	these	other	 a 	 steroid 	 s 	 	,	there	's	a	class	of	the	nickel	iron	,	which	in	platinum	-	group	metal	 market 	 s 	 	 al 	 one 	 	are	worth	 some 	 thing 	 	like	20	trillion	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	if	you	can	go	out	and	grab	one	of	these	 rock 	 s 	 	.
my	plan	is	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	buy	 put 	 s 	 	on	the	precious	metal	market	,	and	then	 actual 	 ly 	 	claim	that	i	'm	going	to	go	out	and	get	one	.
and	that	will	fund	the	actual	mission	to	go	and	get	one	.
but	fear	,	curiosity	and	greed	have	driven	us	.
and	for	me	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	--	i	'm	the	short	kid	on	the	right	.	 th 	 is 	 	was	--	my	 motiv 	 ation 	 	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	apollo	.
and	apollo	was	one	of	the	 great 	 est 	 	 motiv 	 ators 	 	ever	.
if	you	think	about	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	at	the	turn	of	--	early	1960s	,	on	may	25	,	jfk	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	're	going	to	go	to	the	moon	.	``
and	people	left	 the 	 ir 	 	 job 	 s 	 	and	they	went	to	 obscur 	 e 	 	 location 	 s 	 	to	go	and	be	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	mission	.
and	we	 k 	 new 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	about	going	to	space	.
we	went	from	 hav 	 ing 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	put	alan	shepard	in	 sub 	 orbital 	 	flight	to	going	to	the	moon	in	eight	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	the	average	age	of	the	people	that	got	us	there	was	26	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
they	did	n't	know	what	could	n't	be	 d 	 one 	 	.
they	had	to	make	up	 every 	 thing 	 	.	and	that	,	my	friend	,	is	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 motiv 	 ation 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	gene	cernan	,	a	good	friend	of	mine	,	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	if	i	can	go	to	the	moon	``	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	last	human	on	the	moon	so	far	--	``	 noth 	 ing 	 	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	is	 im 	 possible 	 	.	``	but	of	course	,	we	've	thought	about	the	government	 al 	 ways 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	person	taking	us	there	.
but	i	put	forward	here	,	the	government	is	not	going	to	get	us	there	.
the	government	is	 un 	 able 	 	to	take	the	 risk 	 s 	 	 requir 	 ed 	 	to	open	up	 th 	 is 	 	precious	 front 	 ier 	 	.
the	shuttle	is	 cost 	 ing 	 	a	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	launch	.
that	's	a	pathetic	number	.	it	's	 un 	 reason 	 able 	 	.
we	should	n't	be	happy	in	 stand 	 ing 	 	for	that	.
one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	did	with	the	ansari	x	prize	was	take	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	on	that	risk	is	ok	,	you	know	.
 a 	 s 	 	we	are	going	out	there	and	taking	on	a	new	 front 	 ier 	 	,	we	should	be	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	risk	.
in	fact	,	 any 	 one 	 	who	 say 	 s 	 	we	should	n't	,	you	know	,	just	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	put	 a 	 side 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	go	forward	,	in	fact	,	the	 great 	 est 	 	 discover 	 ies 	 	we	will	ever	know	is	 a 	 head 	 	of	us	.
the	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	in	the	space	business	are	the	 fur 	 ry 	 	 mammal 	 s 	 	,	and	 clear 	 ly 	 	the	industrial	-	 militar 	 y 	 	complex	--	with	boeing	and	lockheed	and	nasa	--	are	the	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	.
the	ability	for	us	to	access	these	 resource 	 s 	 	to	gain	planetary	 red 	 un 	 d 	 ancy 	 	--	we	can	now	gather	all	the	information	,	the	genetic	 code 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	 every 	 thing 	 	 store 	 d 	 	on	our	 data 	 base 	 s 	 	,	and	back	them	up	off	the	planet	,	in	case	there	would	be	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 dis 	 astro 	 us 	 	 situ 	 ations 	 	.
the	 difficult 	 y 	 	is	 get 	 ting 	 	there	,	and	 clear 	 ly 	 	,	the	cost	to	orbit	is	key	.
once	you	're	in	orbit	,	you	are	two	 third 	 s 	 	of	the	way	,	 energ 	 et 	 ically 	 	,	to	 any 	 where 	 	--	the	moon	,	to	mars	.	and	 to 	 day 	 	,	there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	three	 vehicle 	 s 	 	--	the	u.s.	shuttle	,	the	russian	soyuz	and	the	chinese	vehicle	--	that	 get 	 s 	 	you	there	.
 argu 	 ably 	 	,	it	's	about	100	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	person	on	the	space	shuttle	.
one	of	the	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	i	 start 	 ed 	 	,	space	 adventure 	 s 	 	,	will	sell	you	a	ticket	.
we	've	 d 	 one 	 	two	so	far	.	we	'll	be	 announc 	 ing 	 	two	more	on	the	soyuz	to	go	up	to	the	space	station	for	20	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
but	that	's	expensive	and	to	understand	what	the	potential	is	--
--	it	is	expensive	.	but	people	are	 will 	 ing 	 	to	pay	that	!
you	know	,	one	--	we	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 ique 	 	period	in	time	 to 	 day 	 	.
for	the	first	time	ever	,	we	have	 en 	 ough 	 	wealth	 concent 	 rated 	 	in	the	 hand 	 s 	 	of	few	 individual 	 s 	 	and	the	technology	 access 	 ible 	 	that	will	allow	us	to	 re 	 ally 	 	drive	space	exploration	.
but	how	cheap	could	it	get	?	i	want	to	give	you	the	end	point	.
we	know	--	20	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	you	can	go	and	buy	a	ticket	,	but	how	cheap	could	it	get	?
let	's	go	back	to	high	school	physics	here	.
if	you	 calcul 	 ate 	 	the	amount	of	potential	energy	,	 m 	 gh 	 	,	to	take	you	and	your	 space 	 suit 	 	up	to	a	couple	hundred	 mile 	 s 	 	,	and	then	you	 accele 	 rate 	 	 your 	 self 	 	to	17,500	 mile 	 s 	 	per	hour	--
remember	,	that	one	half	mv	 square 	 d 	 	--	and	you	figure	it	out	.	it	's	about	5.7	 giga 	 jou 	 les 	 	of	energy	.
if	you	 expend 	 ed 	 	that	over	an	hour	,	it	's	about	1.6	 megawatt 	 s 	 	.
if	you	go	to	one	of	vijay	's	micro	-	power	 source 	 s 	 	,	and	they	sell	it	to	you	for	seven	 cent 	 s 	 	a	kilowatt	hour	--	 any 	 body 	 	here	fast	in	math	?
how	much	will	it	cost	you	and	your	 space 	 suit 	 	to	go	to	orbit	?
100	 buck 	 s 	 	.	that	's	the	price	-	 improve 	 ment 	 	 curv 	 e 	 	that	--	we	need	some	 break 	 through 	 s 	 	in	physics	 a 	 long 	 	the	way	,	i	'll	grant	you	that	.
but	 guy 	 s 	 	,	if	 histo 	 ry 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	taught	us	 any 	 thing 	 	,	it	's	that	if	you	can	imagine	it	,	you	will	get	there	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	.
i	have	no	question	that	the	physics	,	the	 engineer 	 ing 	 	to	get	us	down	to	the	point	where	all	of	us	can	afford	orbital	space	flight	is	around	the	corner	.
the	 difficult 	 y 	 	is	that	there	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	a	real	 market 	 place 	 	to	drive	the	 invest 	 ment 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	the	boeings	and	the	lockheeds	do	n't	 s 	 pend 	 	a	dollar	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	money	in	r	&	d	.
it	's	all	government	research	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	and	 ver 	 y 	 	few	of	 t 	 hose 	 	.
and	in	fact	,	the	large	 corporation 	 s 	 	,	the	 government 	 s 	 	,	ca	n't	take	the	risk	.
so	we	need	what	i	call	an	 exo 	 thermic 	 	economic	 re 	 action 	 	in	space	.
 to 	 day 	 	's	commercial	 market 	 s 	 	 world 	 wide 	 	,	global	commercial	launch	market	?
12	to	15	 launch 	 es 	 	per	year	.
number	of	commercial	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	out	there	?	12	to	15	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.
one	per	company	.	that	's	not	it	.	there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	one	 market 	 place 	 	,	and	i	call	them	self	-	 load 	 ing 	 	carbon	 pay 	 load 	 s 	 	.
they	come	with	 the 	 ir 	 	own	money	.	they	're	easy	to	make	.
it	's	people	.	the	ansari	x	prize	was	my	solution	,	 read 	 ing 	 	about	lindbergh	for	creating	the	 vehicle 	 s 	 	to	get	us	there	.
we	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	10	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	cash	for	the	first	 re 	 us 	 able 	 	ship	,	carry	three	people	up	to	100	 kilometer 	 s 	 	,	come	back	down	,	and	 with 	 in 	 	two	 week 	 s 	 	,	make	the	trip	 aga 	 in 	 	.

peter	diamandis	:	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	most	difficult	thing	that	i	had	to	do	was	raise	the	capital	for	 th 	 is 	 	.	it	was	 liter 	 ally 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	.
we	went	--	i	went	to	100	,	200	ceos	,	cmos	.
no	one	 believ 	 ed 	 	it	was	 d 	 one 	 	.	 every 	 one 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	oh	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	nasa	think	?
well	,	people	are	going	to	die	,	how	can	you	possibly	going	to	put	 th 	 is 	 	forward	?	``
i	found	a	 vision 	 ary 	 	family	,	the	ansari	family	,	and	champ	car	,	and	raised	part	of	the	money	,	but	not	the	full	10	million	.
and	what	i	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 do 	 ing 	 	was	going	out	to	the	 insur 	 ance 	 	industry	and	 buy 	 ing 	 	a	hole	-	in	-	one	 insur 	 ance 	 	policy	.
see	,	the	 insur 	 ance 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	went	to	boeing	and	lockheed	,	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	are	you	going	to	compete	?	``	no	.
``	are	you	going	to	compete	?	``	no.	``	no	one	's	going	to	win	 th 	 is 	 	thing	.	``
so	,	they	took	a	bet	that	no	one	would	win	by	january	of	'05	,	and	i	took	a	bet	that	 some 	 one 	 	would	win	.
so	--	and	the	best	thing	is	they	paid	off	and	the	check	did	n't	 bounc 	 e 	 	.
we	've	had	a	lot	of	 accomplish 	 ments 	 	and	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	tremendous	success	.
one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	i	'm	most	happy	about	is	that	the	spaceshipone	is	going	to	hang	in	air	and	space	museum	,	next	to	the	spirit	of	st.	louis	and	the	wright	 fly 	 er 	 	.
is	n't	that	great	?
so	a	little	bit	about	the	future	,	 step 	 s 	 	to	space	,	what	's	 avail 	 able 	 	for	you	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	you	can	go	and	experience	 weight 	 less 	 	 flight 	 s 	 	.
by	'08	,	 sub 	 orbital 	 	 flight 	 s 	 	,	the	price	tag	for	that	,	you	know	,	on	virgin	,	is	going	to	be	about	200,000	.
there	are	three	or	four	other	serious	 effort 	 s 	 	that	will	 br 	 ing 	 	the	price	down	 ver 	 y 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	,	i	think	,	to	about	25,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	for	a	 sub 	 orbital 	 	flight	.
orbital	 flight 	 s 	 	--	we	can	take	you	to	the	space	station	.
and	then	i	 tru 	 ly 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	,	once	a	group	is	in	orbit	around	the	earth	--	i	know	if	they	do	n't	do	it	,	i	am	--	we	're	going	to	 stock 	 pile 	 	some	fuel	,	make	a	 bee 	 line 	 	for	the	moon	and	grab	some	real	 e 	 state 	 	.

we	're	based	down	in	florida	.
let	me	talk	about	the	other	thing	i	'm	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	.
the	future	of	 prize 	 s 	 	.	you	know	,	 prize 	 s 	 	are	a	 ver 	 y 	 	old	idea	.
i	had	the	pleasure	of	 borrow 	 ing 	 	from	the	 long 	 itude 	 	prize	and	the	orteig	prize	that	put	lindbergh	forward	.
and	we	have	made	a	decision	in	the	x	prize	 found 	 ation 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	carry	that	 con 	 cept 	 	forward	 in 	 to 	 	other	technology	 area 	 s 	 	,	and	we	just	took	on	a	new	mission	 state 	 ment 	 	:	``	to	 br 	 ing 	 	about	radical	 break 	 through 	 s 	 	in	space	and	other	 techno 	 logies 	 	for	the	benefit	of	 human 	 ity 	 	.	``
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	.
i	 show 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	slide	to	larry	page	,	who	just	 join 	 ed 	 	our	board	.
and	you	know	,	when	you	give	to	a	 non 	 profit 	 	,	you	might	have	50	 cent 	 s 	 	on	the	dollar	.
if	you	have	a	 match 	 ing 	 	grant	,	it	's	 typical 	 ly 	 	two	or	three	to	one	.
if	you	put	up	a	prize	,	you	can	get	 liter 	 ally 	 	a	50	to	one	leverage	on	your	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
and	that	's	huge	.	and	then	he	 turn 	 ed 	 	around	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	if	you	back	a	prize	institute	that	 run 	 s 	 	a	10	prize	,	you	get	500	to	one	.	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	that	's	great	.	``
so	,	we	have	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	are	looking	to	turn	the	x	prize	 in 	 to 	 	a	world	-	class	prize	institute	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	you	put	up	a	prize	,	when	you	announce	it	and	 team 	 s 	 	start	to	begin	 do 	 ing 	 	 trial 	 s 	 	.
you	get	 public 	 ity 	 	 in 	 crease 	 	,	and	when	it	's	won	,	 public 	 ity 	 	 shoot 	 s 	 	through	the	roof	--	if	it	's	 proper 	 ly 	 	 manage 	 d 	 	--	and	that	's	part	of	the	 benefit 	 s 	 	to	a	sponsor	.
then	,	when	the	prize	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	won	,	after	it	's	moving	,	you	get	 socie 	 tal 	 	 benefit 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	new	technology	,	new	 cap 	 ability 	 	.
and	the	benefit	to	the	 sponsor 	 s 	 	is	the	sum	of	the	 public 	 ity 	 	and	 socie 	 tal 	 	 benefit 	 s 	 	over	the	long	term	.
that	's	our	value	 pro 	 position 	 	in	a	prize	.
if	you	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	go	and	try	to	create	spaceshipone	,	or	any	kind	of	a	new	technology	,	you	have	to	fund	that	from	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	and	maintain	that	 fund 	 ing 	 	with	an	 un 	 certain 	 	 out 	 come 	 	.
it	may	or	may	not	happen	.	but	if	you	put	up	a	prize	,	the	 beaut 	 iful 	 	thing	is	,	you	know	,	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	maintenance	fee	,	and	you	pay	on	success	.
orteig	did	n't	pay	a	 di 	 me 	 	out	to	the	nine	 team 	 s 	 	that	went	 a 	 cross 	 	--	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	go	 a 	 cross 	 	the	atlantic	,	and	we	did	n't	pay	a	 di 	 me 	 	 un 	 til 	 	 some 	 one 	 	won	the	ansari	x	prize	.
so	,	 prize 	 s 	 	work	great	.
you	know	,	 innov 	 ators 	 	,	the	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	out	there	,	you	know	that	when	you	're	going	for	a	goal	,	the	first	thing	you	have	to	do	is	 believ 	 e 	 	that	you	can	do	it	 your 	 self 	 	.
then	,	you	've	got	to	,	you	know	,	face	potential	public	 ridicul 	 e 	 	of	--	that	's	a	crazy	idea	,	it	'll	never	work	.
and	then	you	have	to	 con 	 vince 	 	 other 	 s 	 	,	so	that	they	can	,	in	fact	,	help	you	raise	the	 fund 	 s 	 	,	and	then	you	've	got	to	deal	with	the	fact	that	you	've	got	government	 bureau 	 cracies 	 	and	 institution 	 s 	 	that	do	n't	want	you	to	move	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	forward	,	and	you	have	to	deal	with	 failure 	 s 	 	.	what	a	prize	 do 	 es 	 	,	what	we	've	 experience 	 d 	 	a	prize	 do 	 ing 	 	,	is	 liter 	 ally 	 	help	to	short	-	circuit	or	support	all	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	a	prize	credentials	the	idea	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	good	idea	.
well	,	it	must	be	a	good	idea	.
 some 	 one 	 	's	 off 	 er 	 ing 	 	10	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	go	and	do	 th 	 is 	 	thing	.
and	each	of	these	 area 	 s 	 	was	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	found	the	ansari	x	prize	 help 	 ed 	 	short	-	circuit	these	for	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
so	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	 organ 	 ization 	 	,	we	put	together	a	prize	 discover 	 y 	 	process	of	how	to	come	up	with	 prize 	 s 	 	and	write	the	 rule 	 s 	 	,	and	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	looking	at	creating	 prize 	 s 	 	in	a	number	of	different	 categor 	 ies 	 	.
we	're	looking	at	 attack 	 ing 	 	energy	,	environment	,	 nano 	 technology 	 	--	and	i	'll	talk	about	 t 	 hose 	 	more	in	a	moment	.
and	the	way	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	that	is	we	're	creating	prize	 team 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	x	prize	.	we	have	a	space	prize	team	.
we	're	going	after	an	orbital	prize	.
we	are	looking	at	a	number	of	energy	 prize 	 s 	 	.
craig	venter	 ha 	 s 	 	just	 join 	 ed 	 	our	board	and	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	a	rapid	genome	 s 	 equ 	 encing 	 	prize	with	him	,
we	'll	be	 announc 	 ing 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	 th 	 is 	 	fall	,	about	--	imagine	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	sequence	 any 	 body 	 	's	dna	for	under	1,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	 revolution 	 ize 	 	medicine	.
and	clean	water	,	education	,	medicine	and	even	looking	at	social	 entrepreneur 	 ship 	 	.
so	my	final	slide	here	is	,	the	most	critical	tool	for	solving	 human 	 ity 	 	's	grand	 challeng 	 es 	 	--	it	is	n't	technology	,
it	is	n't	money	,	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	one	thing	--	it	's	the	 commit 	 ted 	 	,	passionate	human	mind	.
