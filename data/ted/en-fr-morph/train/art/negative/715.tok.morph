 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	come	from	britain	,	but	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	living	in	maldives	for	26	 year 	 s 	 	now	.
so	,	that	's	home	 re 	 ally 	 	.
the	maldives	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	you	're	aware	,	are	a	chain	of	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	off	the	 south 	 west 	 	coast	of	india	here	.
capital	,	malé	,	where	i	live	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	here	 to 	 day 	 	in	mysore	,	we	're	 close 	 r 	 	to	malé	than	we	are	to	delhi	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
if	you	're	in	it	,	india	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	is	the	place	to	be	at	the	moment	.
but	if	you	're	a	marine	biologist	,	maldives	is	not	 s 	 uch 	 	a	bad	place	to	be	.
and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	my	home	these	 year 	 s 	 	.
for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	've	 be 	 en 	 	there	,	fantastic	coral	 reef 	 s 	 	,	fantastic	 div 	 ing 	 	,	fantastic	 snorkel 	 ing 	 	.
i	 s 	 pend 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	of	my	time	 a 	 s 	 	possible	 invest 	 ig 	 ating 	 	the	marine	life	.
i	 stud 	 y 	 	fish	,	 al 	 so 	 	the	 big 	 ger 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 whale 	 s 	 	and	 dolphin 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	blue	whale	.	we	have	blue	 whale 	 s 	 	in	the	 water 	 s 	 	around	here	,	off	maldives	,	around	the	 water 	 s 	 	of	india	.	you	can	see	them	off	kerala	.
and	,	in	fact	,	we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	region	.
one	of	the	best	 place 	 s 	 	in	the	world	to	see	blue	 whale 	 s 	 	is	here	in	 th 	 is 	 	region	.
in	sri	lanka	,	if	you	go	down	to	the	south	coast	of	sri	lanka	,	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	 north 	 east 	 	monsoon	season	,	you	can	see	blue	 whale 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	.
it	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	best	place	in	the	world	to	see	them	.
now	,	when	i	talk	about	the	 north 	 east 	 	monsoon	season	,	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	here	know	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	i	mean	,	but	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	some	of	you	are	not	 quit 	 e 	 	so	 s 	 ure 	 	.
i	need	to	explain	a	little	bit	about	 monsoon 	 s 	 	.
now	,	monsoon	,	the	root	of	the	word	``	monsoon	``	 come 	 s 	 	from	the	word	``	season	.	``
so	,	it	's	just	a	season	.	and	there	are	two	 season 	 s 	 	in	most	of	south	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	.
and	in	the	summer	india	 heat 	 s 	 	up	,	 get 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	hot	.
hot	air	 rise 	 s 	 	,	and	air	is	drawn	in	off	the	sea	to	replace	it	.
and	the	way	it	 work 	 s 	 	is	,	it	 come 	 s 	 	from	the	 south 	 west 	 	.
it	 come 	 s 	 	off	the	ocean	here	and	is	drawn	up	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	india	.
so	it	 come 	 s 	 	from	the	 south 	 west 	 	.	it	's	a	 south 	 west 	 	monsoon	.
 pick 	 s 	 	up	 moist 	 ure 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	 cross 	 es 	 	the	ocean	.
that	's	what	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	the	monsoon	rain	.
and	then	in	the	winter	 thing 	 s 	 	cool	down	.
high	pressure	 build 	 s 	 	over	india	.
and	the	whole	system	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	reverse	.
so	,	the	wind	is	now	coming	from	the	 north 	 east 	 	out	of	india	,	 a 	 cross 	 	the	indian	ocean	,	 th 	 is 	 	way	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	africa	.
keep	that	in	mind	.
now	,	i	'm	a	marine	biologist	,	but	i	'm	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	bit	of	an	old	 fashion 	 ed 	 	 natural 	 ist 	 	,	i	suppose	.
i	'm	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 al 	 most 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	that	 move 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 dragon 	 flies 	 	.	and	i	'm	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	to	talk	,	 th 	 is 	 	afternoon	,	about	 dragon 	 flies 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	species	,	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 orient 	 al 	 	scarlet	.
and	one	thing	you	need	to	know	about	 dragon 	 flies 	 	,	one	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	,	is	that	they	lay	 the 	 ir 	 	 egg 	 s 	 	in	fresh	water	.
they	need	fresh	water	to	breed	.
they	lay	the	 egg 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	fresh	water	.
little	 larva 	 e 	 	hatch	out	in	fresh	water	.
they	feed	on	other	little	 thing 	 s 	 	.	they	feed	on	mosquito	 larva 	 e 	 	.
so	,	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
they	control	mosquito	 larva 	 e 	 	,	among	other	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	they	grow	and	grow	by	 stage 	 s 	 	.	and	they	climb	out	of	the	water	,	burst	out	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	adult	which	we	see	.
and	 typical 	 ly 	 	,	there	is	a	lot	of	 vari 	 ation 	 	,	but	if	you	have	a	 dragon 	 fly 	 	with	,	say	,	a	one	year	life	cycle	,	which	is	 quit 	 e 	 	typical	,	the	larva	,	living	in	the	fresh	water	,	 live 	 s 	 	for	10	or	11	 month 	 s 	 	.
and	then	the	adult	,	which	 come 	 s 	 	after	,	 live 	 s 	 	for	one	or	two	 month 	 s 	 	.
so	it	's	 essential 	 ly 	 	a	 fresh 	 water 	 	animal	.
it	 re 	 ally 	 	 do 	 es 	 	need	fresh	water	.
now	,	the	 part 	 icular 	 	species	of	 dragon 	 fly 	 	i	want	to	talk	about	is	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	 be 	 cause 	 	most	 dragon 	 flies 	 	,	like	the	one	we	've	just	 s 	 een 	 	,	when	the	adult	is	there	for	 it 	 s 	 	brief	one	or	two	 month 	 s 	 	of	life	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	go	 ver 	 y 	 	far	.	it	ca	n't	travel	 ver 	 y 	 	far	.
a	few	 kilometer 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	,	is	 quit 	 e 	 	typical	.
they	are	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 fli 	 ers 	 	,	but	they	do	n't	go	too	far	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	guy	is	an	exception	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 glob 	 e 	 	 skimm 	 er 	 	,	or	 wander 	 ing 	 	glider	.
and	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	name	might	suggest	,	it	is	found	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	around	the	world	.
it	 live 	 s 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	 tropic 	 s 	 	,	the	americas	,	africa	,	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	,	australia	,	 in 	 to 	 	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	.
and	it	 wander 	 s 	 	far	and	wide	.	we	know	that	much	about	it	.
but	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 be 	 en 	 	 stud 	 ied 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
it	's	a	 ra 	 ther 	 	 mediocr 	 e 	 	looking	 dragon 	 fly 	 	.
if	you	're	going	to	 stud 	 y 	 	 dragon 	 flies 	 	,	you	want	to	 stud 	 y 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	bright	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 one 	 s 	 	,	like	that	red	one	.	or	the	 re 	 ally 	 	rare	 one 	 s 	 	,	the	 en 	 demic 	 	 en 	 danger 	 ed 	 	 one 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	,	it	 seem 	 s 	 	a	bit	dull	you	know	.
it	's	sort	of	dull	-	 color 	 ed 	 	.	and	it	's	 fair 	 ly 	 	common	.
and	it	 occur 	 s 	 	 every 	 where 	 	--	you	know	,	why	 both 	 er 	 	?
but	if	you	take	that	attitude	,	you	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	special	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 dragon 	 fly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 ra 	 ther 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	story	to	tell	.
and	i	feel	 ver 	 y 	 	 privilege 	 d 	 	to	have	 s 	 tumble 	 d 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	it	living	in	the	maldives	.
when	i	first	went	to	the	maldives	,	dead	keen	on	 div 	 ing 	 	,	 s 	 pent 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	of	my	time	 a 	 s 	 	i	could	in	and	under	the	water	.
did	n't	notice	any	 dragon 	 flies 	 	;	 may 	 be 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	there	,	 may 	 be 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	.
did	n't	notice	them	.
but	after	some	time	,	after	some	 month 	 s 	 	,	one	day	 a 	 s 	 	i	was	going	out	and	about	,	 sudden 	 ly 	 	i	 notice 	 d 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 dragon 	 flies 	 	,	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 dragon 	 flies 	 	.
 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	these	are	all	 th 	 is 	 	species	 glob 	 e 	 	 skimm 	 er 	 	.
i	did	n't	know	at	the	time	,	but	i	know	now	,
they	're	 glob 	 e 	 	skimmers	,	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	them	.
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	there	for	some	time	.	and	then	they	 we 	 re 	 	gone	.
and	i	did	n't	think	 any 	 thing 	 	more	of	it	 un 	 til 	 	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	year	,	when	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	,	and	then	the	year	after	that	,	and	then	the	year	after	that	.
and	i	was	a	bit	 s 	 low 	 	,	i	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	take	too	much	notice	.
but	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	some	maldivian	 friend 	 s 	 	and	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	,	and	 y 	 es 	 	they	come	every	year	.
and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	people	about	them	and	 y 	 es 	 	,	they	 k 	 new 	 	,	but	they	did	n't	know	 any 	 thing 	 	,	where	they	came	from	,	or	 any 	 thing 	 	.
and	 aga 	 in 	 	i	did	n't	think	too	much	of	it	.
but	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	it	 beg 	 an 	 	to	dawn	on	me	that	 some 	 thing 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	special	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 dragon 	 flies 	 	need	fresh	water	to	breed	.
and	the	maldives	,	and	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	some	of	you	have	 be 	 en 	 	there	--	so	here	is	home	.
so	,	maldives	,	 beaut 	 iful 	 	place	.
it	's	built	 entire 	 ly 	 	of	coral	 reef 	 s 	 	.
and	on	top	of	the	coral	 reef 	 s 	 	are	sand	 bank 	 s 	 	.
average	height	,	about	that	much	above	sea	level	.
so	,	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	,	sea	level	rise	,	it	's	a	real	serious	issue	.
but	i	'm	not	going	to	talk	about	that	.
 an 	 other 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	point	of	these	sand	 bank 	 s 	 	is	that	when	it	 rain 	 s 	 	,	the	 rain 	 water 	 	 soak 	 s 	 	down	 in 	 to 	 	the	 s 	 oil 	 	.	so	,	it	's	gone	.
so	,	it	 stay 	 s 	 	under	the	 s 	 oil 	 	.
the	 tree 	 s 	 	can	put	 the 	 ir 	 	 root 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	it	.
 human 	 s 	 	can	dig	 hole 	 s 	 	and	make	a	well	.
but	 dragon 	 flies 	 	--	a	bit	 trick 	 y 	 	.
there	is	no	surface	fresh	water	.
there	are	no	 pond 	 s 	 	,	 stream 	 s 	 	,	 river 	 s 	 	,	 lake 	 s 	 	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	like	that	.
so	,	why	is	it	that	every	year	 million 	 s 	 	of	 dragon 	 flies 	 	,	 million 	 s 	 	,	 million 	 s 	 	of	 dragon 	 flies 	 	turn	up	?
i	got	a	little	bit	 cur 	 ious 	 	.	in	fact	i	'll	stop	here	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	want	to	ask	,	and	there	is	a	lot	of	people	who	,	from	india	of	course	,	people	who	grew	up	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	your	 child 	 hood 	 	here	.
 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	are	indian	or	 s 	 pent 	 	your	 child 	 hood 	 	here	,	let	me	have	a	show	of	 hand 	 s 	 	,	who	of	you	--	not	yet	,	not	yet	!
you	're	too	keen	.	you	're	too	keen	.	no	.	hang	on	.	hang	on	.
wait	for	the	go	.	i	'll	say	go	.
 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	grew	up	in	india	,	do	you	remember	in	your	 child 	 hood 	 	,	 dragon 	 flies 	 	,	 s 	 warm 	 s 	 	of	 dragon 	 flies 	 	?	 may 	 be 	 	at	school	,	 may 	 be 	 	 ty 	 ing 	 	little	bits	of	string	onto	them	?
 may 	 be 	 	 pull 	 ing 	 	bits	off	?	i	'm	not	 ask 	 ing 	 	about	that	.
you	've	 on 	 ly 	 	got	to	say	,	do	you	remember	 see 	 ing 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 dragon 	 flies 	 	.
any	 hand 	 s 	 	?	any	 hand 	 s 	 	?	 y 	 es 	 	.	thank	you	.	thank	you	.
it	's	a	 wide 	 spread 	 	 phenomen 	 on 	 	 through 	 out 	 	south	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	the	maldives	.
and	i	got	a	bit	 cur 	 ious 	 	about	it	.
in	the	maldives	--	now	,	in	india	there	is	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	water	,	so	,	 dragon 	 flies 	 	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	of	course	.	why	not	?
but	in	maldives	,	no	fresh	water	.	so	,	what	on	earth	is	going	on	?
and	the	first	thing	i	did	was	 start 	 ed 	 	 record 	 ing 	 	when	they	 turn 	 ed 	 	up	in	the	maldives	.
and	there	is	the	answer	,	21st	of	october	.
not	every	year	,	that	's	the	average	date	.
so	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	writing	it	down	for	15	 year 	 s 	 	now	.
you	'd	think	they	're	coming	from	india	.	it	's	the	 close 	 st 	 	place	.
but	in	october	,	remember	,	we	're	still	in	 south 	 west 	 	monsoon	,
maldives	is	still	in	the	 south 	 west 	 	monsoon	.
but	wind	is	,	 in 	 vari 	 ably 	 	,	every	time	,	is	from	the	west	.
it	's	going	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	india	,	not	from	india	.
so	,	are	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	how	are	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	here	?
are	they	coming	from	india	against	the	wind	?
 seem 	 ed 	 	a	bit	 un 	 like 	 ly 	 	.
so	,	next	thing	i	did	is	i	got	on	the	phone	.
maldives	is	a	long	 arch 	 ipelago 	 	.
it	 stretch 	 es 	 	about	500	 mile 	 s 	 	,	of	course	it	's	india	here	.
i	got	on	the	phone	and	 email 	 ed 	 	to	 friend 	 s 	 	and	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	.
when	do	you	see	the	 dragon 	 flies 	 	appear	?
and	 pre 	 tty 	 	soon	,	a	picture	 start 	 ed 	 	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	.
in	bangalore	,	a	 col 	 league 	 	there	 s 	 ent 	 	me	information	for	three	 year 	 s 	 	,	average	,	24th	of	september	,	so	late	september	.
down	in	trivandrum	,	a	bit	 lat 	 er 	 	.
far	north	of	maldives	,	a	bit	 lat 	 er 	 	.
then	malé	,	then	further	south	.
and	then	the	 southern 	 most 	 	maldives	.
it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	obvious	,	they	're	coming	from	india	.
but	they	are	coming	400	 mile 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	ocean	,	against	the	wind	.
how	on	earth	are	they	 do 	 ing 	 	that	?
i	did	n't	know	.
the	next	thing	i	did	was	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 count 	 ing 	 	 dragon 	 flies 	 	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	know	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 season 	 ality 	 	,	what	time	of	year	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	when	they	first	 arriv 	 e 	 	,	but	how	long	are	they	around	for	?	 do 	 es 	 	that	give	any	 clue 	 s 	 	?
so	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 rigor 	 ous 	 	scientific	process	.
i	had	a	 rigor 	 ous 	 	scientific	 trans 	 ect 	 	.
i	got	on	my	 bi 	 cycle 	 	,	and	i	 cycle 	 d 	 	around	the	 is 	 land 	 	of	malé	.
it	's	about	five	 kilometer 	 s 	 	around	,	 count 	 ing 	 	the	 dragon 	 flies 	 	 a 	 s 	 	i	go	,	 try 	 ing 	 	not	to	bump	 in 	 to 	 	people	 a 	 s 	 	i	'm	looking	in	the	 tree 	 s 	 	.
and	they	're	here	for	a	 ver 	 y 	 	short	time	,	october	,	november	,	december	.	that	's	it	.
and	then	they	tail	off	,	there	's	a	few	,	but	that	's	it	.
october	,	november	,	december	.	that	is	not	the	 north 	 east 	 	monsoon	season	.
that	's	not	the	 south 	 west 	 	season	.
that	's	the	inter	-	monsoon	,	the	time	when	the	monsoon	 change 	 s 	 	.
now	,	what	i	 s 	 aid 	 	was	,	you	get	the	 south 	 west 	 	monsoon	going	one	way	,	and	then	it	 change 	 s 	 	and	you	get	the	 north 	 east 	 	monsoon	going	the	other	way	.
and	that	sort	of	 give 	 s 	 	the	impression	you	've	got	one	air	mass	going	up	and	down	,	up	and	down	.	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	like	that	.
what	 happen 	 s 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	is	there	is	two	air	 masse 	 s 	 	.
and	there	is	a	front	between	them	,	and	the	front	 move 	 s 	 	.
so	,	if	you	've	got	india	here	,	when	the	front	is	up	above	india	you	're	 in 	 to 	 	the	 south 	 west 	 	monsoon	.
then	the	front	 move 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 north 	 east 	 	monsoon	.
and	that	front	in	the	middle	is	not	 vert 	 ical 	 	,	it	's	at	an	angle	.
so	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 come 	 s 	 	over	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	malé	i	'm	 stand 	 ing 	 	in	malé	 under 	 neath 	 	the	front	.
i	can	be	in	the	 south 	 west 	 	monsoon	.
but	the	wind	above	is	from	the	 north 	 east 	 	monsoon	.
so	,	the	 dragon 	 flies 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	coming	from	india	on	the	 north 	 east 	 	monsoon	,
but	at	an	altitude	at	1,000	to	2,000	 meter 	 s 	 	up	in	the	air	.	 in 	 credible 	 	.
these	little	 insect 	 s 	 	,	it	's	the	same	 one 	 s 	 	we	see	out	here	[	in	india	]	,	two	 inch 	 es 	 	long	,	five	 centimeter 	 s 	 	long	,	 fly 	 ing 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 million 	 s 	 	,	400	 mile 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	ocean	,	at	2,000	 meter 	 s 	 	up	.	 quit 	 e 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	.
so	,	i	was	 quit 	 e 	 	 pleas 	 ed 	 	with	 my 	 self 	 	.	i	thought	 w 	 ow 	 	,	i	've	 track 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	i	know	how	they	come	here	.	then	i	 scratch 	 ed 	 	my	head	a	bit	,	and	that	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	i	know	how	they	come	here	,	but	why	do	they	come	here	?
what	are	 million 	 s 	 	of	 dragon 	 flies 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	,	 fly 	 ing 	 	out	over	the	ocean	every	year	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 ap 	 parent 	 	doom	?
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	sense	.	there	is	 noth 	 ing 	 	for	them	in	maldives	.
what	on	earth	are	they	 do 	 ing 	 	?
well	,	to	cut	a	long	story	short	,	they	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 fly 	 ing 	 	right	 a 	 cross 	 	the	ocean	.
they	're	making	it	all	the	way	 a 	 cross 	 	to	east	africa	.
i	know	that	 be 	 cause 	 	i	have	 friend 	 s 	 	who	work	on	 fish 	 eries 	 	'	research	 vessel 	 s 	 	who	have	 s 	 ent 	 	to	me	 report 	 s 	 	from	 boat 	 s 	 	out	in	the	ocean	.
i	know	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	 report 	 s 	 	from	seychelles	,	which	fit	in	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	down	here	.
and	i	know	 be 	 cause 	 	when	you	look	at	the	 rain 	 fall 	 	,	these	 part 	 icular 	 	 insect 	 s 	 	,	these	 glob 	 e 	 	skimmers	breed	in	 tempor 	 ary 	 	rain	water	 pool 	 s 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	they	lay	 the 	 ir 	 	 egg 	 s 	 	where	the	 season 	 al 	 	 rain 	 s 	 	are	,	the	monsoon	 rain 	 s 	 	.
the	 larva 	 e 	 	have	to	develop	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
they	 on 	 ly 	 	take	six	 week 	 s 	 	.	 in 	 stead 	 	of	11	 month 	 s 	 	,	they	're	six	 week 	 s 	 	.	they	're	up	,	and	they	're	off	.
now	,	here	we	have	,	in	case	you	ca	n't	read	at	the	back	,	the	top	is	 rain 	 fall 	 	for	india	.
and	we	're	 start 	 ing 	 	in	june	.	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	monsoon	rain	.
by	september	,	october	,	it	's	 dry 	 ing 	 	out	.
 noth 	 ing 	 	for	these	 dragon 	 flies 	 	.	there	is	no	more	 season 	 al 	 	rain	.
they	've	got	to	go	 hunt 	 ing 	 	for	 season 	 al 	 	rain	.
and	they	fly	south	.	 a 	 s 	 	the	monsoon	 withdraw 	 s 	 	to	the	south	they	come	down	through	karnataka	,	 in 	 to 	 	kerala	.
and	then	they	run	out	of	land	.
but	they	are	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	good	 fli 	 ers 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	species	,	it	can	fly	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 kilometer 	 s 	 	.
and	it	just	 keep 	 s 	 	going	.	and	the	wind	,	the	 north 	 east 	 	wind	 s 	 woosh 	 es 	 	it	around	and	 car 	 ries 	 	it	off	 a 	 cross 	 	the	ocean	to	africa	,	where	it	's	 rain 	 ing 	 	.
and	they	are	 breed 	 ing 	 	in	the	 rain 	 s 	 	of	africa	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 south 	 east 	 	africa	.	it	 make 	 s 	 	it	look	like	there	are	sort	of	two	 breed 	 ing 	 	 period 	 s 	 	here	.	it	's	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	more	 complic 	 ated 	 	than	that	.
what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	is	they	are	 breed 	 ing 	 	in	the	monsoon	 rain 	 s 	 	here	.
and	the	 dragon 	 flies 	 	you	can	see	 to 	 day 	 	 out 	 side 	 	here	,	on	the	campus	,	are	the	young	of	 th 	 is 	 	generation	.
they	 hatch 	 ed 	 	out	in	india	.
they	're	looking	for	 some 	 where 	 	to	breed	.	if	it	 rain 	 s 	 	here	they	'll	breed	.
but	most	of	them	are	going	to	carry	on	.	and	next	stop	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	four	or	five	 day 	 s 	 	away	is	going	to	be	east	africa	.
the	wind	will	 s 	 woosh 	 	them	out	 a 	 cross 	 	here	.
if	they	pass	the	maldives	they	might	go	and	have	a	look	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	there	,	they	'll	carry	on	.
here	,	here	,	kenya	,	east	africa	,	they	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	just	come	out	of	a	long	drought	.
just	last	week	the	 rain 	 s 	 	broke	.	the	short	 rain 	 s 	 	broke
and	it	's	 rain 	 ing 	 	there	now	.
and	the	 dragon 	 flies 	 	are	there	.	i	have	 report 	 s 	 	from	my	 vari 	 ous 	 	 contact 	 s 	 	.
the	 dragon 	 flies 	 	are	here	now	.	they	're	 breed 	 ing 	 	there	.
when	 t 	 hose 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	,	they	'll	lay	 the 	 ir 	 	 egg 	 s 	 	now	.
they	'll	hatch	out	in	six	 week 	 s 	 	.	by	that	time	the	 season 	 al 	 	 rain 	 s 	 	have	 move 	 d 	 	on	.	it	's	not	there	,	it	's	down	here	.
they	'll	fly	down	here	.	and	the	clever	thing	is	the	wind	is	 al 	 ways 	 	 converg 	 ing 	 	to	where	the	rain	is	.
the	rain	 occur 	 s 	 	,	these	are	summer	 rain 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	summer	monsoon	.
the	 s 	 un 	 	is	 over 	 head 	 	there	.	summer	 rain 	 s 	 	in	southern	africa	.
the	 s 	 un 	 	is	 over 	 head 	 	,	 maxim 	 um 	 	 heat 	 ing 	 	,	 maxim 	 um 	 	 evapo 	 ration 	 	,	 maxim 	 um 	 	 cloud 	 s 	 	,	 maxim 	 um 	 	 rain 	 fall 	 	,	 maxim 	 um 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	for	 re 	 production 	 	.
not	 on 	 ly 	 	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	have	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 ve 	 ction 	 	,	you	have	 th 	 is 	 	 ris 	 ing 	 	of	the	air	where	it	's	hot	,	air	is	drawn	in	.
there	's	a	 converg 	 ence 	 	.	so	,	 where 	 ver 	 	the	rain	is	 fall 	 ing 	 	,	the	air	is	drawn	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	it	to	replace	the	air	that	's	 ris 	 ing 	 	.
so	,	the	little	fellow	that	 hatch 	 es 	 	out	here	,	he	 get 	 s 	 	up	 in 	 to 	 	the	air	,	he	is	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	carried	to	where	the	rain	is	 fall 	 ing 	 	.
lay	 the 	 ir 	 	 egg 	 s 	 	,	next	generation	,	they	come	up	,	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	carried	to	where	the	rain	is	 fall 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	now	back	there	.	they	come	out	,	it	's	time	to	come	back	.
so	,	in	four	 generation 	 s 	 	,	one	,	two	,	three	,	four	and	then	back	.
a	complete	circuit	of	the	indian	ocean	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	circuit	of	about	16,000	 kilometer 	 s 	 	.
16,000	 kilometer 	 s 	 	,	four	 generation 	 s 	 	,	mind	you	,	for	a	two	inch	long	insect	.	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	from	north	america	will	be	familiar	with	the	 mon 	 arch 	 	 butter 	 fly 	 	.
which	,	up	 un 	 til 	 	now	 ha 	 s 	 	had	the	 long 	 est 	 	known	insect	 migr 	 ation 	 	.
it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	half	the	length	of	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 cross 	 ing 	 	here	,	of	the	ocean	,	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 tru 	 ly 	 	regular	 trans 	 ocean 	 ic 	 	 cross 	 ing 	 	of	any	insect	.
a	 quit 	 e 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	feat	.
and	i	 on 	 ly 	 	 s 	 tumble 	 d 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	was	living	in	malé	,	in	maldives	for	long	 en 	 ough 	 	for	it	to	 per 	 col 	 ate 	 	 in 	 to 	 	my	brain	that	 some 	 thing 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	special	was	going	on	.
but	 dragon 	 flies 	 	are	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 creature 	 s 	 	that	make	the	 cross 	 ing 	 	.
there	is	more	to	the	story	.
i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 bird 	 s 	 	.	and	i	'm	familiar	with	 th 	 is 	 	fellow	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ra 	 ther 	 	special	bird	.
it	's	a	falcon	.	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	eastern	red	-	footed	falcon	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	.
but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	amur	falcon	.
and	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	amur	falcon	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 breed 	 s 	 	in	amurland	.	which	is	an	area	 a 	 long 	 	the	amur	river	,	which	is	up	here	.
it	's	the	border	,	much	of	it	is	the	border	between	 chin 	 a 	 	and	russia	,	up	here	in	the	far	east	.
so	,	siberia	,	manchuria	.
and	that	's	where	it	 breed 	 s 	 	.
and	if	you	're	a	falcon	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	a	nice	place	to	be	in	the	summer	.
but	it	's	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	 mis 	 er 	 able 	 	place	to	be	in	the	winter	.
it	's	,	well	,	you	can	imagine	.
so	,	 a 	 s 	 	any	 sens 	 ible 	 	bird	would	do	,	he	 move 	 s 	 	south	.	they	move	south	.	the	whole	population	 move 	 s 	 	south	.
but	then	the	 be 	 ing 	 	 sens 	 ible 	 	 stop 	 ped 	 	.
so	,	now	they	do	n't	stop	here	,	or	even	down	here	.
no	,	they	turn	 a 	 cross 	 	here	.
they	have	a	little	 re 	 fuel 	 ing 	 	stop	in	 north 	 eastern 	 	india	.
they	come	to	the	latitude	of	about	mumbai	or	goa	.
and	then	they	strike	out	 a 	 cross 	 	the	ocean	,	down	to	kenya	.
and	down	here	,	and	they	winter	down	here	[	in	southern	africa	]	.
 in 	 credible 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	most	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 migr 	 ation 	 	of	any	bird	of	 pre 	 y 	 	.	a	 quit 	 e 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	 migr 	 ation 	 	.
and	they	are	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	one	that	 make 	 s 	 	the	 cross 	 ing 	 	.
they	have	the	most	 in 	 credible 	 	journey	,	but	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	make	the	 cross 	 ing 	 	from	india	to	africa	.	 include 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	the	hobby	.
 th 	 is 	 	fellow	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	nice	bird	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	pied	cuckoo	.
 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	from	 north 	 ern 	 	india	will	be	familiar	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	 come 	 s 	 	with	the	 monsoon 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	time	of	year	they	cross	back	to	africa	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	guy	,	the	roller	,	a	 ra 	 ther 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	bird	.
it	's	known	 a 	 s 	 	the	eurasian	roller	.	in	india	it	 occur 	 s 	 	in	the	 north 	 west 	 	,
so	it	's	known	 a 	 s 	 	the	kashmir	roller	.
and	these	 bird 	 s 	 	,	what	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	is	i	've	 com 	 plied 	 	all	the	 record 	 s 	 	,	all	the	 avail 	 able 	 	 record 	 s 	 	of	these	 bird 	 s 	 	,	put	them	together	,	and	found	out	they	 migr 	 ate 	 	at	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	time	 a 	 s 	 	the	 dragon 	 flies 	 	.
they	make	use	of	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	 wind 	 s 	 	.
they	travel	at	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	time	with	the	same	 wind 	 s 	 	to	make	the	 cross 	 ing 	 	.	i	know	they	travel	at	the	same	altitude	.
it	's	known	about	the	amur	falcon	.	 th 	 is 	 	guy	,	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	one	of	these	met	an	 un 	 fortunate 	 	end	.
he	was	 fly 	 ing 	 	off	the	coast	of	goa	,	21	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	1988	.	october	,	1988	.

so	,	they	are	using	the	same	 wind 	 s 	 	.
