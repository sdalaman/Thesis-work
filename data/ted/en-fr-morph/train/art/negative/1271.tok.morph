there	is	yves	rossy	.
and	i	think	the	wing	is	open	,	the	wing	is	open	.
so	our	first	critical	moment	,	it	's	open	.
he	is	down	.	is	he	 fly 	 ing 	 	?
 comment 	 ator 	 	two	:	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	he	's	 stabil 	 ized 	 	.
he	's	 start 	 ing 	 	to	make	his	climb	.

he	's	out	over	the	channel	.
there	is	yves	rossy	.
there	is	no	 turn 	 ing 	 	back	now	.
he	is	over	the	english	channel	and	 under 	 way 	 	.
 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	an	historic	flight	 ha 	 s 	 	 beg 	 un 	 	.
 comment 	 ator 	 	two	:	and	what	he	's	going	to	do	 a 	 s 	 	he	 approach 	 es 	 	the	ground	is	pull	down	on	 t 	 hose 	 	 toggle 	 s 	 	to	flare	,	 s 	 low 	 	 him 	 self 	 	down	just	a	little	bit	,	and	then	come	in	for	a	nice	 land 	 ing 	 	.
 comment 	 ator 	 	:	there	he	is	.
yves	rossy	 ha 	 s 	 	 land 	 ed 	 	in	england	.
bruno	giussani	:	and	now	he	's	in	edinburgh	.	yves	rossy	.
and	his	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
yves	,	welcome	.	it	is	 quit 	 e 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	 sequence 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	shot	over	the	last	three	 year 	 s 	 	in	 vari 	 ous 	 	 moment 	 s 	 	of	your	 activ 	 ities 	 	.
and	there	 we 	 re 	 	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 other 	 s 	 	.
so	it	's	possible	to	fly	 al 	 most 	 	like	a	bird	.
what	is	it	[	like	]	to	be	up	there	?
yves	rossy	:	it	's	 f 	 un 	 	.	it	's	 f 	 un 	 	.
i	do	n't	have	 feather 	 s 	 	.
but	i	feel	like	a	bird	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	an	 un 	 real 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 normal 	 ly 	 	you	have	a	big	thing	,	a	plane	,	around	you	.
and	when	i	 s 	 trap 	 	just	these	little	 harness 	 es 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	little	wing	,	i	 re 	 ally 	 	have	the	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	a	bird	.
bg	:	how	did	you	start	to	 be 	 come 	 	jetman	?
yr	:	it	was	about	20	 year 	 s 	 	ago	when	i	 discover 	 ed 	 	free	 fall 	 ing 	 	.
when	you	go	out	of	an	 air 	 plane 	 	you	are	 al 	 most 	 	naked	.
you	take	a	position	like	that	.
and	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	when	you	take	a	 track 	 ing 	 	position	,	you	have	the	 feel 	 ing 	 	that	you	are	 fly 	 ing 	 	.
and	that	's	the	 near 	 est 	 	thing	to	the	dream	.
you	have	no	machine	around	you	.
you	are	just	in	the	element	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	short	and	 on 	 ly 	 	in	one	direction	.
so	the	idea	was	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	keep	that	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	 free 	 dom 	 	,	but	change	the	vector	and	 in 	 crease 	 	the	time	.
bg	:	so	i	'm	kind	of	 cur 	 ious 	 	,	what	's	your	top	speed	?
yr	:	it	's	about	300	km	per	hour	before	 loop 	 ing 	 	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	about	190	 mile 	 s 	 	per	hour	.
bg	:	and	what	's	the	weight	of	the	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	you	're	 carry 	 ing 	 	?
yr	:	when	i	exit	full	of	 ker 	 os 	 ene 	 	,	i	'm	about	55	 kilo 	 s 	 	.
i	have	55	 kilo 	 s 	 	on	my	back	.
bg	:	and	you	're	not	 pilot 	 ing 	 	?
there	is	no	handle	,	no	 steer 	 ing 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	?
it	is	 pur 	 e 	 ly 	 	your	body	,	and	the	 wing 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	part	of	the	body	and	vice	versa	?
yr	:	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	the	goal	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	put	[	in	]	 steer 	 ing 	 	,	then	you	 re 	 invent 	 	the	 air 	 plane 	 	.
and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	keep	 th 	 is 	 	 free 	 dom 	 	of	 move 	 ment 	 	.
and	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	like	the	kid	 play 	 ing 	 	the	 air 	 plane 	 	.
i	want	to	go	down	like	that	.
and	up	i	climb	,	i	turn	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 pur 	 e 	 	 fly 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	not	 steer 	 ing 	 	,	it	's	flight	.
bg	:	what	kind	of	training	do	you	do	,	you	 personal 	 ly 	 	,	for	that	?
yr	:	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	try	to	stay	just	fit	.
i	do	n't	do	special	physical	training	.
just	,	i	try	to	keep	my	 mobil 	 ity 	 	through	new	 activ 	 ities 	 	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	last	winter	i	 beg 	 an 	 	with	kite	surfing	--	so	new	 thing 	 s 	 	.
so	you	have	to	adapt	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	--	i	'm	 quit 	 e 	 	an	 experience 	 d 	 	 manage 	 r 	 	of	 system 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	pilot	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	--	you	need	 fluid 	 ity 	 	,	you	need	to	be	 ag 	 ile 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	to	adapt	 re 	 ally 	 	fast	.
bg	:	 some 	 body 	 	in	the	audience	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	,	``	how	 do 	 es 	 	he	breathe	up	there	?	``
 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	going	fast	and	you	're	up	3,000	 meter 	 s 	 	or	so	.
yr	:	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	up	to	3,000	 meter 	 s 	 	,	it	's	not	 s 	 uch 	 	a	big	problem	with	oxygen	.
but	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 bike 	 rs 	 	,	they	have	the	same	speed	.
just	with	the	helmet	,	 integ 	 ral 	 	helmet	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	no	problem	to	breathe	.
bg	:	 de 	 scribe 	 	for	me	the	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	since	you	have	it	here	.
so	breitling	's	four	 engine 	 s 	 	.
yr	:	 yea 	 h 	 	,	two	-	meter	span	.
ultrastable	profile	.
four	little	 engine 	 s 	 	,	22	 kilo 	 s 	 	thrust	each	,	 turbine 	 s 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	with	 ker 	 os 	 ene 	 	.
harness	,	 parachut 	 e 	 	.
my	 on 	 ly 	 	 instrument 	 s 	 	are	[	an	]	 al 	 time 	 ter 	 	and	time	.
i	know	i	have	about	eight	 minute 	 s 	 	fuel	.
so	just	check	before	it	's	 finish 	 ed 	 	.
and	 yea 	 h 	 	,	that	's	all	.
two	 parachut 	 es 	 	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	,	if	i	have	a	problem	with	the	first	one	i	pull	,	i	still	have	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	to	open	the	second	one	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	life	.
that	's	the	real	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	about	 safe 	 ty 	 	.
i	did	use	that	 dur 	 ing 	 	these	last	15	 year 	 s 	 	about	20	 time 	 s 	 	--	never	with	that	type	of	wing	,	but	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
i	can	 re 	 lease 	 	my	wing	when	i	am	in	a	spin	or	 un 	 s 	 table 	 	.
bg	:	we	saw	the	2009	 cross 	 ing 	 	of	the	gibraltar	strait	where	you	lost	control	and	then	you	 div 	 ed 	 	down	 in 	 to 	 	the	 cloud 	 s 	 	and	in	the	ocean	.
so	that	was	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 case 	 s 	 	where	you	let	the	 wing 	 s 	 	go	,	right	?
yr	:	 yea 	 h 	 	.	i	did	try	in	[	the	]	 cloud 	 s 	 	,	but	you	lose	[	 orient 	 ation 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	]	.
so	i	did	try	to	take	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	a	climb	altitude	.
i	thought	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	i	will	go	out	.
but	most	 prob 	 ably 	 	i	did	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
bg	:	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	not	 ver 	 y 	 	safe	in	image	.
yr	:	but	you	feel	great	,	but	you	have	not	the	right	altitude	.
so	the	next	thing	i	saw	was	just	blue	.
it	was	the	sea	.
i	have	 al 	 so 	 	an	audible	 al 	 time 	 ter 	 	.
so	i	was	at	my	 minim 	 um 	 	altitude	in	that	vector	--	fast	--	so	i	 pull 	 ed 	 	that	.
and	then	i	did	open	my	chute	.
bg	:	so	the	 wing 	 s 	 	have	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 parachut 	 e 	 	,	and	you	have	your	two	 parachut 	 es 	 	.
yr	:	 exact 	 ly 	 	.	there	is	a	 rescu 	 e 	 	 parachut 	 e 	 	for	the	wing	for	two	 reason 	 s 	 	:	so	i	can	repair	it	 after 	 ward 	 	and	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	so	 no 	 body 	 	 take 	 s 	 	that	,	just	on	his	head	.
bg	:	i	see	.	 may 	 be 	 	come	back	here	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 risk 	 y 	 	stuff	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	.
people	have	 di 	 ed 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	thing	.
and	you	do	n't	look	like	a	crazy	guy	;	you	're	a	swiss	 air 	 line 	 	pilot	,	so	you	're	 ra 	 ther 	 	a	 check 	 list 	 	kind	of	guy	.
i	 assum 	 e 	 	you	have	 standard 	 s 	 	.
yr	:	 yea 	 h 	 	.	i	have	no	 check 	 list 	 	for	that	.
bg	:	let	's	not	tell	you	 employ 	 er 	 	.
yr	:	no	,	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	two	 world 	 s 	 	.
civil	 av 	 iation 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	know	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.
we	have	a	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	of	experience	.
and	you	can	adapt	 re 	 ally 	 	 precise 	 ly 	 	.
with	that	,	i	have	to	adapt	to	 some 	 thing 	 	new	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	 improv 	 ise 	 	.
so	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	a	play	between	these	two	 approach 	 es 	 	.
 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	know	 ver 	 y 	 	well	--	these	 principle 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	we	have	two	 engine 	 s 	 	on	an	airbus	;	with	 on 	 ly 	 	one	engine	,	you	can	fly	it	.
so	plan	b	,	 al 	 ways 	 	a	plan	b	.
in	a	 fight 	 er 	 	,	you	have	an	 eject 	 ion 	 	seat	.
that	's	my	 eject 	 ion 	 	seat	.
so	i	have	the	approach	of	a	professional	pilot	with	the	respect	of	a	pioneer	in	front	of	mother	nature	.
bg	:	it	's	well	 s 	 aid 	 	.	it	's	well	 s 	 aid 	 	.
what	 happen 	 s 	 	if	one	of	the	 engine 	 s 	 	 stop 	 s 	 	?
yr	:	i	do	a	roll	.
and	then	i	 stabil 	 ize 	 	,	and	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	my	altitude	,	i	 continu 	 e 	 	on	two	or	three	 engine 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	possible	--	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	to	explain	--	but	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	which	regime	i	was	,	i	can	 continu 	 e 	 	on	two	and	try	to	get	a	nice	place	to	land	,	and	then	i	open	my	 parachut 	 e 	 	.
bg	:	so	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	flight	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	you	jump	off	a	plane	or	a	helicopter	,	and	you	go	on	a	 d 	 ive 	 	and	 accele 	 rate 	 	the	 engine 	 s 	 	,	and	then	you	 bas 	 ically 	 	take	off	mid	-	air	 some 	 where 	 	.
and	then	the	 land 	 ing 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	have	 s 	 een 	 	,	 arriv 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	side	of	the	channel	,	is	through	a	 parachut 	 e 	 	.
so	just	 a 	 s 	 	a	curiosity	,	where	did	you	land	when	you	flew	over	the	grand	canyon	?
did	you	land	on	the	rim	,	down	at	the	bottom	?
yr	:	it	was	down	on	the	bottom	.
and	i	came	back	 after 	 ward 	 	on	the	 s 	 led 	 	of	the	helicopter	back	.
but	it	was	too	 stone 	 y 	 	and	full	of	 c 	 actu 	 s 	 	on	top	.
bg	:	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	why	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	question	.
yr	:	and	 al 	 so 	 	the	 current 	 s 	 	are	 quit 	 e 	 	funny	there	.
there	is	big	thermal	activity	,	big	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	altitude	 al 	 so 	 	.
so	it	was	much	 safe 	 r 	 	for	me	to	land	at	the	bottom	.
bg	:	so	i	think	that	right	now	,	 man 	 y 	 	people	in	the	audience	are	 ask 	 ing 	 	,	``	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	when	are	you	 develop 	 ing 	 	a	double	-	seater	so	they	can	fly	with	you	?	``
yr	:	i	have	a	standard	answer	.
have	you	ever	 s 	 een 	 	tandem	 bird 	 s 	 	?
bg	:	perfect	answer	.
yves	,	one	last	question	.
what	's	next	for	you	?	what	's	next	for	jetman	?
yr	:	first	,	to	instruct	a	 young 	 er 	 	guy	.
i	want	to	share	it	,	to	do	 form 	 ation 	 	 flight 	 s 	 	.
and	i	plan	to	start	from	a	cliff	,	like	 catapult 	 ed 	 	from	a	cliff	.
bg	:	so	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 jump 	 ing 	 	off	a	plane	,	 y 	 es 	 	?
yr	:	 y 	 es 	 	,	with	the	final	goal	to	take	off	,	but	with	 initi 	 al 	 	speed	.
 re 	 ally 	 	,	i	go	step	by	step	.
it	 seem 	 s 	 	a	little	bit	crazy	,	but	it	's	not	.
it	's	possible	to	start	 al 	 ready 	 	now	,	it	's	just	too	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
 thank 	 s 	 	to	the	increasing	technology	,	better	technology	,	it	will	be	safe	.
and	i	hope	it	will	be	for	 every 	 body 	 	.
bg	:	yves	,	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.	yves	rossy	.
