all	human	life	,	all	life	,	 depend 	 s 	 	on	 plant 	 s 	 	.
let	me	try	to	 con 	 vince 	 	you	of	that	in	a	few	 second 	 s 	 	.
just	think	for	a	moment	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	 whet 	 her 	 	you	live	in	a	small	african	village	,	or	you	live	in	a	big	city	,	 every 	 thing 	 	 come 	 s 	 	back	to	 plant 	 s 	 	in	the	end	:
 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	for	the	food	,	the	medicine	,	the	fuel	,	the	construction	,	the	 cloth 	 ing 	 	,	all	the	obvious	 thing 	 s 	 	;	or	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	for	the	spiritual	and	 re 	 creation 	 al 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	matter	to	us	so	much	;	or	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	 s 	 oil 	 	 form 	 ation 	 	,	or	the	effect	on	the	atmosphere	,	or	 prim 	 ary 	 	production	.
damn	it	,	even	the	 book 	 s 	 	here	are	made	out	of	 plant 	 s 	 	.
all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	they	come	back	to	 plant 	 s 	 	.
and	 with 	 out 	 	them	we	would	n't	be	here	.
now	 plant 	 s 	 	are	under	threat	.
they	're	under	threat	 be 	 cause 	 	of	changing	climate	.
and	they	are	 al 	 so 	 	under	threat	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	sharing	a	planet	with	people	like	us	.
and	people	like	us	want	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	that	destroy	 plant 	 s 	 	,	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 habit 	 at 	 s 	 	.
and	 whet 	 her 	 	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	of	food	production	,	or	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 introduc 	 tion 	 	of	alien	 plant 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 place 	 s 	 	that	they	 re 	 ally 	 	ought	n't	be	,	or	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 habit 	 at 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	used	for	other	 purpose 	 s 	 	--	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	meaning	that	 plant 	 s 	 	have	to	adapt	,	or	die	,	or	move	.
and	 plant 	 s 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	find	it	 ra 	 ther 	 	difficult	to	move	 be 	 cause 	 	there	might	be	cities	and	other	 thing 	 s 	 	in	the	way	.
so	if	all	human	life	 depend 	 s 	 	on	 plant 	 s 	 	,	 do 	 es 	 	n't	it	make	sense	that	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	we	should	try	to	 s 	 ave 	 	them	?
i	think	it	 do 	 es 	 	.
and	i	want	to	tell	you	about	a	project	to	 s 	 ave 	 	 plant 	 s 	 	.
and	the	way	that	you	 s 	 ave 	 	 plant 	 s 	 	is	by	storing	 seed 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 seed 	 s 	 	,	in	all	 the 	 ir 	 	 divers 	 e 	 	 glor 	 y 	 	,	are	 plant 	 s 	 	'	 future 	 s 	 	.
all	the	genetic	information	for	future	 generation 	 s 	 	of	 plant 	 s 	 	are	held	in	 seed 	 s 	 	.
so	here	is	the	building	;
it	 look 	 s 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	 un 	 assum 	 ing 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	.
but	it	 go 	 es 	 	down	 be 	 low 	 	ground	 man 	 y 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	.
and	it	's	the	largest	seed	bank	in	the	world	.
it	 exist 	 s 	 	not	 on 	 ly 	 	in	southern	england	,	but	 distribut 	 ed 	 	around	the	world	.	i	'll	come	to	that	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	nuclear	-	proof	 facil 	 ity 	 	.
god	forbid	that	it	should	have	to	 with 	 stand 	 	that	.
so	if	you	're	going	to	build	a	seed	bank	,	you	have	to	decide	what	you	're	going	to	store	in	it	.	right	?
and	we	 decide 	 d 	 	that	what	we	want	to	store	first	of	all	,	are	the	species	that	are	most	under	threat	.
and	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	dry	land	species	.
so	first	of	all	we	did	 deal 	 s 	 	with	50	different	 count 	 ries 	 	.
it	 mean 	 s 	 	 negoti 	 ating 	 	with	 head 	 s 	 	of	state	,	and	with	 secret 	 aries 	 	of	state	in	50	 count 	 ries 	 	to	sign	 treat 	 ies 	 	.
we	have	120	partner	 institution 	 s 	 	all	over	the	world	,	in	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	 color 	 ed 	 	 o 	 range 	 	.
people	come	from	all	over	the	world	to	learn	,
and	then	they	go	away	and	plan	 exact 	 ly 	 	how	they	're	going	to	collect	these	 seed 	 s 	 	.
they	have	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	all	over	the	world	 tag 	 ging 	 	 place 	 s 	 	where	 t 	 hose 	 	 plant 	 s 	 	are	 s 	 aid 	 	to	exist	.
they	search	for	them	.	they	find	them	in	flower	.
and	they	go	back	when	 the 	 ir 	 	 seed 	 s 	 	have	 arriv 	 ed 	 	.
and	they	collect	the	 seed 	 s 	 	.	all	over	the	world	.
the	 seed 	 s 	 	--	some	of	if	is	 ver 	 y 	 	untechnical	.
you	kind	of	 shove 	 l 	 	them	all	in	to	 bag 	 s 	 	and	dry	them	off	.
you	label	them	.	you	do	some	high	-	tech	 thing 	 s 	 	here	and	there	,
some	low	-	tech	 thing 	 s 	 	here	and	there	.
and	the	main	thing	is	that	you	have	to	dry	them	 ver 	 y 	 	 care 	 fully 	 	,	at	low	temperature	.
and	then	you	have	to	store	them	at	about	minus	20	 degree 	 s 	 	c	--	that	's	about	minus	four	fahrenheit	,	i	think	--	with	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 critical 	 ly 	 	low	 moist 	 ure 	 	content	.
and	these	 seed 	 s 	 	will	be	able	to	germinate	,	we	 believ 	 e 	 	,	with	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	species	,	in	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	 certain 	 ly 	 	in	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
it	's	no	good	storing	the	 seed 	 s 	 	if	you	do	n't	know	they	're	still	 vi 	 able 	 	.
so	every	10	 year 	 s 	 	we	do	germination	 test 	 s 	 	on	every	 s 	 ample 	 	of	 seed 	 s 	 	that	we	have	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 distribut 	 ed 	 	network	.
so	all	around	the	world	people	are	 do 	 ing 	 	the	same	thing	.
and	that	 en 	 able 	 s 	 	us	to	develop	germination	 proto 	 col 	 s 	 	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	we	know	the	right	combination	of	heat	and	cold	and	the	 cycle 	 s 	 	that	you	have	to	get	to	make	the	seed	germinate	.
and	that	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	information	.
and	then	we	grow	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,
and	we	tell	people	,	back	in	the	 count 	 ries 	 	where	these	 seed 	 s 	 	have	come	from	,	``	look	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	we	're	not	just	storing	 th 	 is 	 	to	get	the	 seed 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	but	we	can	give	you	 th 	 is 	 	information	about	how	to	germinate	these	difficult	 plant 	 s 	 	.	``
and	that	's	 al 	 ready 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
so	where	have	we	got	to	?
i	am	 pleas 	 ed 	 	to	unveil	that	our	three	 billion 	 th 	 	seed	--	that	's	three	thousand	 million 	 th 	 	seed	--	is	now	 store 	 d 	 	.
ten	percent	of	all	plant	species	on	the	planet	,
24,000	species	are	safe	;
30,000	species	,	if	we	get	the	 fund 	 ing 	 	,	by	next	year	.
twenty	-	five	percent	of	all	the	world	's	 plant 	 s 	 	,	by	2020	.
these	are	not	just	crop	 plant 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	might	have	 s 	 een 	 	 store 	 d 	 	in	svalbard	in	norway	--
fantastic	work	there	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	at	 l 	 east 	 	100	 time 	 s 	 	 big 	 ger 	 	.
we	have	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 collect 	 ions 	 	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 ent 	 	out	all	over	the	world	:
drought	-	 toler 	 ant 	 	forest	species	 s 	 ent 	 	to	pakistan	and	egypt	;
 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 photo 	 synthetic 	 	-	efficient	 plant 	 s 	 	come	here	to	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	;
salt	-	 toler 	 ant 	 	 past 	 ure 	 	species	 s 	 ent 	 	to	australia	;
the	list	 go 	 es 	 	on	and	on	.
these	 seed 	 s 	 	are	used	for	 resto 	 ration 	 	.
so	in	 habit 	 at 	 s 	 	that	have	 al 	 ready 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 damage 	 d 	 	,
like	the	tall	grass	prairie	here	in	the	usa	,	or	in	 min 	 ed 	 	land	in	 vari 	 ous 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	 resto 	 ration 	 	is	 al 	 ready 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	these	species	--
and	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 collect 	 ion 	 	.
some	of	these	 plant 	 s 	 	,	like	the	 one 	 s 	 	on	the	bottom	to	the	left	of	your	screen	,	they	are	down	to	the	last	few	 remain 	 ing 	 	 member 	 s 	 	.
the	one	where	the	guy	is	 collect 	 ing 	 	 seed 	 s 	 	there	on	the	truck	,	that	is	down	to	about	30	last	 remain 	 ing 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	.
 fantastic 	 ally 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	plant	,	both	for	protein	and	for	medicine	.
we	have	training	going	on	in	 chin 	 a 	 	,	in	the	usa	,	and	 man 	 y 	 	other	 count 	 ries 	 	.
how	much	 do 	 es 	 	it	cost	?
2,800	 dollar 	 s 	 	per	species	is	the	average	.
i	think	that	's	cheap	,	at	the	price	.
and	that	 get 	 s 	 	you	all	the	scientific	data	that	 go 	 es 	 	with	it	.
the	future	research	is	``	how	can	we	find	the	genetic	and	 mole 	 cular 	 	 marker 	 s 	 	for	the	 vi 	 ability 	 	of	 seed 	 s 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	plant	them	every	10	 year 	 s 	 	?	``
and	we	're	 al 	 most 	 	there	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
