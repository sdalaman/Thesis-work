i	was	 list 	 ed 	 	on	the	 on 	 line 	 	 bio 	 graphy 	 	that	 s 	 aid 	 	i	was	a	design	 mission 	 ary 	 	.
that	's	a	bit	lofty	;	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	more	of	 some 	 thing 	 	like	a	street	 walk 	 er 	 	.
i	 s 	 pend 	 	a	lot	of	time	in	urban	 area 	 s 	 	looking	for	design	,	and	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	design	in	the	public	sector	.
i	take	about	5,000	 photograph 	 s 	 	a	year	,	and	i	thought	that	i	would	edit	from	these	,	and	try	to	come	up	with	some	 image 	 s 	 	that	might	be	appropriate	and	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	you	.
and	i	used	three	 cri 	 ter 	 ia 	 	:	the	first	was	,	i	thought	i	'd	talk	about	real	design	 with 	 in 	 	reach	,	design	that	's	free	,	not	design	not	 quit 	 e 	 	 with 	 in 	 	reach	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	're	 fond 	 ly 	 	known	by	our	 com 	 petition 	 	and	 competitor 	 s 	 	,	but	stuff	that	you	can	find	on	the	 street 	 s 	 	,	stuff	that	was	free	,	stuff	that	was	 avail 	 able 	 	to	all	people	,	and	stuff	that	 prob 	 ably 	 	 contain 	 s 	 	some	other	 import 	 ant 	 	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	.
i	'll	use	these	 side 	 walk 	 s 	 	in	rio	 a 	 s 	 	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
a	 ver 	 y 	 	common	public	design	 d 	 one 	 	in	the	'50s	.
it	's	got	a	nice	kind	of	 flow 	 ing 	 	,	 organ 	 ic 	 	form	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 consist 	 ent 	 	with	the	brazilian	culture	--
i	think	good	design	 add 	 s 	 	to	culture	.
 who 	 lly 	 	 in 	 consist 	 ent 	 	with	san	francisco	or	new	york	.
but	i	think	these	are	my	sort	of	information	 high 	 ways 	 	:	i	live	in	much	more	of	an	analog	world	,	where	pedestrian	traffic	and	 interact 	 ion 	 	and	 divers 	 ity 	 	 ex 	 change 	 	,	and	where	i	think	the	simple	 thing 	 s 	 	under	our	feet	have	a	great	amount	of	meaning	to	us	.
how	did	i	get	 start 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	business	?
i	was	a	ceramic	 design 	 er 	 	for	about	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	just	 love 	 d 	 	 util 	 itarian 	 	form	--
simple	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	use	every	day	,	little	 com 	 position 	 s 	 	of	color	and	surface	on	form	.
 th 	 is 	 	led	me	to	 start 	 ing 	 	a	company	 call 	 ed 	 	design	 with 	 in 	 	reach	,	a	company	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	simple	 form 	 s 	 	,	making	good	 design 	 ers 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	to	us	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	selling	the	 personal 	 ities 	 	and	character	of	the	 design 	 ers 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	and	it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	have	 work 	 ed 	 	.
a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	process	,	i	 s 	 pent 	 	a	lot	of	time	in	europe	 travel 	 ing 	 	around	,	looking	for	design	.
and	i	had	a	bit	of	a	wake	-	up	call	in	amsterdam	:	i	was	there	going	 in 	 to 	 	the	design	 store 	 s 	 	,	and	 mix 	 ing 	 	with	our	crowd	of	 design 	 ers 	 	,	and	i	 recogn 	 ized 	 	that	a	whole	lot	of	stuff	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 look 	 ed 	 	the	same	,	and	the	effect	of	 global 	 ization 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	had	that	in	our	community	 al 	 so 	 	.
we	know	a	lot	about	what	's	going	on	with	design	around	the	world	,	and	it	's	 get 	 ting 	 	 increasing 	 ly 	 	more	difficult	to	find	design	that	 reflect 	 s 	 	a	 un 	 ique 	 	culture	.
i	was	 walk 	 ing 	 	around	on	the	 street 	 s 	 	of	amsterdam	and	i	 recogn 	 ized 	 	,	you	know	,	the	big	story	from	amsterdam	is	n't	what	's	in	the	design	 store 	 s 	 	,	it	's	what	's	out	on	the	 street 	 s 	 	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	it	's	self	-	 explan 	 atory 	 	,	but	a	city	that	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 be 	 en 	 	taken	over	by	 modern 	 ism 	 	,	that	's	 preserve 	 d 	 	 it 	 s 	 	kind	of	 architect 	 ure 	 	and	character	,	and	where	the	 bi 	 cycle 	 	 play 	 s 	 	an	 import 	 ant 	 	part	of	the	way	in	which	people	get	around	and	where	pedestrian	 right 	 s 	 	are	 protect 	 ed 	 	.
and	i	write	a	 news 	 letter 	 	that	 go 	 es 	 	out	every	week	,	and	i	wrote	an	article	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	it	got	 s 	 uch 	 	enormous	 respons 	 e 	 	that	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	design	,	that	common	design	,	that	's	in	the	public	area	 mean 	 s 	 	a	lot	to	people	,	and	 establish 	 es 	 	kind	of	a	 ground 	 work 	 	and	a	 dia 	 log 	 	.
i	then	kind	of	thought	about	the	other	cities	in	europe	where	i	 s 	 pend 	 	a	lot	of	time	looking	for	design	,	like	basel	,	where	vitra	is	 locate 	 d 	 	,	or	in	 north 	 ern 	 	italy	--
all	cities	where	there	are	a	whole	lot	of	 bi 	 cycle 	 s 	 	,	and	where	pedestrian	 area 	 s 	 	--	and	i	came	to	the	 con 	 clusion 	 	that	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	there	was	 some 	 thing 	 	about	these	 import 	 ant 	 	design	 center 	 s 	 	that	 deal 	 t 	 	with	 bi 	 cycle 	 s 	 	and	foot	traffic	,	and	i	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	the	skeptic	eye	would	say	,	no	,	the	correlation	there	is	that	there	are	 un 	 ive 	 rs 	 ities 	 	and	 school 	 s 	 	where	people	ca	n't	afford	 car 	 s 	 	,	but	it	did	seem	that	in	 man 	 y 	 	of	these	 area 	 s 	 	pedestrian	traffic	was	 protect 	 ed 	 	.
you	would	n't	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	and	call	 th 	 is 	 	a	 design 	 er 	 	bike	:	a	 design 	 er 	 	bike	is	made	of	 titan 	 ium 	 	or	molybdenum	.
but	i	 beg 	 an 	 	looking	at	design	in	a	place	like	amsterdam	and	 recogn 	 ized 	 	,	you	know	,	the	first	job	of	design	is	to	serve	a	social	purpose	.
and	so	i	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	bike	 a 	 s 	 	not	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 design 	 er 	 	bike	,	but	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	design	.
and	since	that	time	in	amsterdam	,	i	 s 	 pent 	 	an	increasing	amount	of	time	in	the	cities	,	looking	at	design	for	common	evidence	of	design	that	 re 	 ally 	 	is	n't	under	so	much	of	a	 design 	 er 	 	's	signature	.
i	was	in	buenos	aires	 ver 	 y 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	and	i	went	to	see	 th 	 is 	 	bridge	by	santiago	calatrava	.
he	's	a	spanish	architect	and	 design 	 er 	 	.
and	the	tourist	 brochure 	 s 	 	 point 	 ed 	 	me	in	the	direction	of	 th 	 is 	 	bridge	--
i	love	 bridge 	 s 	 	,	 metaphor 	 ically 	 	and	 symbol 	 ically 	 	and	 structural 	 ly 	 	--
and	it	was	a	bit	of	a	 disappoint 	 ment 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	sludge	from	the	river	was	 en 	 crust 	 ed 	 	on	it	;	it	 re 	 ally 	 	was	n't	in	use	.
and	i	 recogn 	 ized 	 	that	 often 	 time 	 s 	 	design	,	when	you	're	set	up	to	see	design	,	it	can	be	a	bit	of	a	 let 	 down 	 	.
but	there	 we 	 re 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	other	 thing 	 s 	 	going	on	in	 th 	 is 	 	area	:	it	was	a	kind	of	construction	zone	;	a	lot	of	 building 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	going	up	.
and	,	 approach 	 ing 	 	a	building	from	a	distance	,	you	do	n't	see	too	much	;	you	get	a	little	 close 	 r 	 	,	and	you	 arriv 	 e 	 	at	a	nice	little	 com 	 position 	 	that	might	 re 	 mind 	 	you	of	a	mondrian	or	a	diebenkorn	or	 some 	 thing 	 	.
but	to	me	it	was	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	industrial	 material 	 s 	 	with	a	little	bit	of	 color 	 s 	 	and	 anim 	 ation 	 	and	a	nice	little	still	life	--	kind	of	 un 	 intend 	 ed 	 	piece	of	design	.
and	going	a	little	 close 	 r 	 	,	you	get	a	different	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	.
i	find	these	little	 vignette 	 s 	 	,	these	little	 accident 	 al 	 	 piece 	 s 	 	of	design	,	to	be	 re 	 fresh 	 ing 	 	.
they	give	me	,	i	do	n't	know	,	a	sense	of	 correct 	 ness 	 	in	the	world	and	some	visual	 de 	 light 	 	in	the	knowledge	that	the	building	will	 prob 	 ably 	 	never	look	 a 	 s 	 	good	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	simple	industrial	 scaffold 	 ing 	 	that	is	there	to	serve	.
down	the	road	,	there	was	 an 	 other 	 	building	,	a	nice	visual	structure	:	 horizon 	 tal 	 	,	 vert 	 ical 	 	 element 	 s 	 	,	little	 decor 	 ative 	 	lines	going	 a 	 cross 	 	,	these	magenta	 squigg 	 les 	 	,	the	 work 	 men 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 reduc 	 ed 	 	to	 decor 	 ative 	 	 element 	 s 	 	,	just	a	nice	,	kind	of	,	 break 	 up 	 	of	the	urban	place	.
and	,	you	know	,	that	no	 long 	 er 	 	 exist 	 s 	 	.
you	've	 capture 	 d 	 	it	for	a	moment	,	and	 find 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	little	still	life	's	like	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	little	 song 	 s 	 	or	 some 	 thing 	 	:	it	 give 	 s 	 	me	an	enormous	amount	of	pleasure	.

i	've	often	 wonder 	 ed 	 	why	italy	is	 re 	 ally 	 	a	 lead 	 er 	 	in	modern	design	.
in	our	area	,	in	 fur 	 nish 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	they	're	sort	of	way	at	the	top	.

and	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	,	you	know	,	italy	is	a	place	where	they	can	accept	these	different	 ideo 	 logies 	 	and	deal	with	 divers 	 ity 	 	and	not	have	the	problem	,	or	they	can	 choos 	 e 	 	to	 ignor 	 e 	 	them	,	but	these	--	you	do	n't	have	 war 	 ring 	 	 fact 	 ions 	 	,	and	i	think	that	 may 	 be 	 	the	 toler 	 ance 	 	of	the	 absurd 	 ity 	 	which	 ha 	 s 	 	made	italy	so	 innov 	 ative 	 	and	so	 toler 	 ant 	 	.
the	past	and	the	present	work	 quit 	 e 	 	well	together	in	italy	 al 	 so 	 	,	and	i	think	that	it	's	 recogn 	 izable 	 	there	,	and	 ha 	 s 	 	an	 import 	 ant 	 	effect	on	culture	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	public	 space 	 s 	 	are	 protect 	 ed 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 side 	 walk 	 s 	 	are	 protect 	 ed 	 	,	and	you	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	able	to	confront	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 physical 	 ly 	 	,	and	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	 help 	 s 	 	people	get	over	 the 	 ir 	 	fear	of	 modern 	 ism 	 	and	other	 s 	 uch 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
a	change	might	be	a	typical	street	corner	in	san	francisco	.
and	i	use	 th 	 is 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	sort	of	,	what	i	consider	to	be	urban	spam	.
i	notice	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	 be 	 cause 	 	i	walk	a	lot	,	but	here	,	private	industry	is	 re 	 ally 	 	kind	of	making	a	mess	of	the	public	sector	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	look	at	it	,	i	sort	of	say	,	you	know	,	the	 public 	 ations 	 	that	report	on	 problem 	 s 	 	in	the	urban	area	 al 	 so 	 	 con 	 tribute 	 	to	it	,	and	it	's	just	my	call	to	say	to	all	of	us	,	public	policy	wo	n't	change	 th 	 is 	 	at	all	;	private	industry	 ha 	 s 	 	to	work	to	take	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	 serious 	 ly 	 	.
the	 extrem 	 e 	 	might	be	in	italy	where	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	there	's	kind	of	some	type	of	control	over	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	the	environment	is	 ver 	 y 	 	evident	,	even	in	the	way	that	they	sell	and	 distribut 	 e 	 	 period 	 ical 	 s 	 	.
i	walk	to	work	every	day	or	ride	my	 s 	 cooter 	 	,	and	i	come	down	and	park	in	 th 	 is 	 	little	spot	.

now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	going	to	impress	you	 guy 	 s 	 	who	photoshop	,	and	can	do	stuff	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	was	an	actual	moment	when	i	got	off	my	bike	,	and	i	 look 	 ed 	 	and	i	thought	,	it	's	 a 	 s 	 	if	all	of	my	 bike 	 r 	 	brethren	had	kind	of	gotten	together	and	 conspi 	 red 	 	to	make	a	little	 state 	 ment 	 	.
and	it	 re 	 minded 	 	me	that	--
to	keep	in	the	present	,	to	look	out	for	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
it	 g 	 ave 	 	me	 possibil 	 ities 	 	for	wonder	--
if	 may 	 be 	 	it	's	a	yellow	day	in	san	francisco	,	and	we	could	all	agree	,	and	create	some	 install 	 ations 	 	.
but	it	 al 	 so 	 	 re 	 minded 	 	me	of	the	power	of	pattern	and	 re 	 petition 	 	to	make	an	effect	in	our	mind	.
and	i	do	n't	know	if	there	's	a	 strong 	 er 	 	kind	of	effect	than	pattern	and	the	way	it	 un 	 ites 	 	kind	of	disparate	 element 	 s 	 	.
i	was	at	the	art	show	in	miami	in	december	,	and	 s 	 pent 	 	a	couple	of	 hour 	 s 	 	looking	at	fine	art	,	and	 amaz 	 ed 	 	at	the	 price 	 s 	 	of	art	and	how	expensive	it	is	,	but	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	great	time	looking	at	it	.

and	i	thought	that	if	pattern	can	 un 	 ite 	 	these	disparate	 element 	 s 	 	,	it	can	do	just	about	 any 	 thing 	 	.
i	do	n't	have	 ver 	 y 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 shot 	 s 	 	of	people	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	kind	of	get	in	the	way	of	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	 pur 	 e 	 	form	.
i	was	in	a	small	restaurant	in	spain	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	lunch	--
one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	nice	 day 	 s 	 	where	you	had	the	place	kind	of	to	 your 	 self 	 	,	and	you	have	a	glass	of	wine	,	and	 enjoy 	 ing 	 	the	local	area	and	the	culture	and	the	food	and	the	quiet	,	and	 feel 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	,	and	a	bus	load	of	 tourist 	 s 	 	 arriv 	 ed 	 	,	 empti 	 ed 	 	out	,	 fill 	 ed 	 	up	the	restaurant	.
in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	short	period	of	time	,	 complete 	 ly 	 	 change 	 d 	 	the	atmosphere	and	character	with	loud	 voice 	 s 	 	and	large	bodies	and	 s 	 uch 	 	,	and	we	had	to	get	up	and	 leav 	 e 	 	;	it	was	just	that	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	.
and	at	that	moment	,	the	 s 	 un 	 	came	out	,	and	through	 th 	 is 	 	 perfo 	 rated 	 	screen	,	a	pattern	was	cast	over	these	bodies	and	they	kind	of	 fad 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	rear	,	and	we	left	the	restaurant	kind	of	 feel 	 ing 	 	o.k	.	about	stuff	.
and	i	do	think	pattern	 ha 	 s 	 	the	 cap 	 ability 	 	of	 eradic 	 ating 	 	some	of	the	most	 e 	 vil 	 	 force 	 s 	 	of	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	bad	form	in	 restaurant 	 s 	 	,	but	 quit 	 e 	 	 serious 	 ly 	 	,	it	was	a	 state 	 ment 	 	to	me	that	one	thing	that	you	do	,	sort	of	,	see	is	the	 aggress 	 ive 	 	nature	of	the	industrial	world	 ha 	 s 	 	 produce 	 d 	 	--
kind	of	,	large	 masse 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	when	you	--	in	 mono 	 culture 	 	,	and	i	think	the	 p 	 reservation 	 	of	 divers 	 ity 	 	in	culture	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	us	.
the	last	 shot 	 s 	 	that	i	have	deal	with	--
coming	back	to	 th 	 is 	 	theme	of	 side 	 walk 	 s 	 	,	and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	say	 some 	 thing 	 	here	about	--	i	'm	,	kind	of	,	 optimist 	 ic 	 	,	you	know	.
post	-	second	world	war	,	the	influence	of	the	 auto 	 mobile 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 deva 	 stat 	 ing 	 	in	a	lot	of	our	cities	.
a	lot	of	urban	 area 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 convert 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 park 	 ing 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	in	a	sort	of	 in 	 discriminate 	 	use	.
a	lot	of	the	 plan 	 ning 	 	 depart 	 ments 	 	 be 	 came 	 	 subordinate 	 d 	 	to	the	 transport 	 ation 	 	 depart 	 ment 	 	.	it	's	 a 	 s 	 	easy	to	rag	on	 car 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	on	wal	-	mart	;	i	'm	not	going	to	do	that	.
but	they	're	real	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	in	 urban 	 ization 	 	and	the	change	that	's	 occur 	 red 	 	in	the	last	number	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 height 	 ened 	 	 sensitiv 	 ity 	 	to	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	our	urban	 environment 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	cultural	 center 	 s 	 	.
i	think	that	they	are	,	that	the	 state 	 ments 	 	that	we	make	in	 th 	 is 	 	public	sector	are	our	 con 	 trib 	 ution 	 s 	 	to	a	 large 	 r 	 	whole	.
cities	are	the	place	where	we	're	most	 like 	 ly 	 	to	 en 	 counter 	 	 divers 	 ity 	 	and	to	mix	with	other	people	.
we	go	there	for	 stimul 	 ation 	 	in	art	and	all	 t 	 hose 	 	other	 thing 	 s 	 	.
but	i	think	people	have	 recogn 	 ized 	 	the	 sanct 	 ity 	 	of	our	urban	 area 	 s 	 	.
a	place	like	chicago	 ha 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 reach 	 ed 	 	kind	of	a	level	of	 inter 	 national 	 	 st 	 ature 	 	.
the	u.s.	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 coming 	 	a	bit	of	a	 lead 	 er 	 	in	kind	of	 enlighten 	 ed 	 	urban	 plan 	 ning 	 	and	 renew 	 al 	 	,	and	i	want	to	single	out	a	place	like	chicago	,	where	i	look	at	some	guy	like	mayor	daley	 a 	 s 	 	a	bit	of	a	design	hero	for	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	work	through	the	 politic 	 al 	 	 process 	 es 	 	and	all	that	to	improve	an	area	.
you	would	expect	a	city	like	 th 	 is 	 	to	have	 up 	 grad 	 ed 	 	flower	boxes	on	michigan	 a 	 venue 	 	where	 wealth 	 y 	 	people	shop	,	but	if	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	go	 a 	 long 	 	the	street	you	find	the	flower	boxes	change	from	street	to	street	:	there	's	actual	 divers 	 ity 	 	in	the	 plant 	 s 	 	.
and	the	idea	that	a	city	group	can	maintain	different	 type 	 s 	 	of	 folia 	 ge 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 exception 	 al 	 	.
there	are	common	 element 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	that	you	'll	see	 through 	 out 	 	chicago	,	and	then	there	are	your	big	-	d	design	 state 	 ments 	 	:	the	pritzker	pavilion	 d 	 one 	 	by	frank	gehry	.
my	measure	of	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	an	 import 	 ant 	 	bit	of	design	is	not	so	much	the	way	that	it	 look 	 s 	 	,	but	the	fact	that	it	 perform 	 s 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	social	function	.
there	are	a	lot	of	free	 concert 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	that	go	on	in	 th 	 is 	 	area	;	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 phenomen 	 al 	 	acoustic	system	.
but	the	 commit 	 ment 	 	that	the	city	 ha 	 s 	 	made	to	the	public	area	is	significant	,	and	 al 	 most 	 	an	 inter 	 national 	 	model	.
i	work	on	the	mayor	's	council	in	san	francisco	,	on	the	 inter 	 national 	 	design	council	for	 mayor 	 s 	 	,	and	chicago	is	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 a 	 s 	 	the	pinnacle	,	and	i	 re 	 ally 	 	would	like	to	 salut 	 e 	 	mayor	daley	and	the	 folk 	 s 	 	there	.
i	thought	that	i	should	include	at	 l 	 east 	 	one	shot	of	technology	for	you	 guy 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	in	 mill 	 e 	 nnium 	 	park	in	chicago	,	where	the	spanish	artist	-	 design 	 er 	 	plensa	 ha 	 s 	 	 create 	 d 	 	,	kind	of	,	a	digital	 read 	 out 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	park	that	 reflect 	 s 	 	back	the	 character 	 s 	 	and	 personal 	 ities 	 	of	the	people	in	 th 	 is 	 	area	.
and	it	's	a	 wel 	 coming 	 	area	,	i	think	,	inclusive	of	 divers 	 ity 	 	,	 reflect 	 ive 	 	of	 divers 	 ity 	 	,	and	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	marriage	of	both	technology	and	art	in	the	public	sector	is	an	area	where	the	u.s.	can	 re 	 ally 	 	take	a	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	role	,	and	chicago	is	one	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
