so	i	'm	going	to	talk	 to 	 day 	 	about	 collect 	 ing 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	in	some	 un 	 convention 	 al 	 	ways	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	of	me	from	a	 ver 	 y 	 	awkward	stage	in	my	life	.
you	might	enjoy	the	 awkward 	 ly 	 	tight	,	cut	-	off	pajama	 bottom 	 s 	 	with	 balloon 	 s 	 	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	it	was	a	time	when	i	was	 main 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 collect 	 ing 	 	 imagin 	 ary 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	of	me	 hold 	 ing 	 	one	of	the	first	 water 	 color 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	i	ever	made	.
and	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	much	more	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 collect 	 ing 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	from	 re 	 ality 	 	--	so	,	real	 st 	 ories 	 	.
and	 specific 	 ally 	 	,	i	'm	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 collect 	 ing 	 	my	own	 st 	 ories 	 	,	 st 	 ories 	 	from	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	and	then	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	 st 	 ories 	 	from	life	,	which	is	kind	of	a	new	area	of	work	that	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	.
so	i	'll	be	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	each	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
so	,	first	of	all	,	my	own	 st 	 ories 	 	.	these	are	two	of	my	 sketch 	 book 	 s 	 	.
i	have	 man 	 y 	 	of	these	 book 	 s 	 	,	and	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 keep 	 ing 	 	them	for	about	the	last	eight	or	nine	 year 	 s 	 	.
they	 ac 	 company 	 	me	 where 	 ver 	 	i	go	in	my	life	,	and	i	fill	them	with	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 record 	 s 	 	of	my	lived	experience	:
so	 water 	 color 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	 draw 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	what	i	see	,	dead	 flower 	 s 	 	,	dead	 insect 	 s 	 	,	 past 	 ed 	 	ticket	 s 	 tub 	 s 	 	,	 rust 	 ing 	 	 co 	 in 	 s 	 	,	business	 card 	 s 	 	,	 writing 	 s 	 	.
and	in	these	 book 	 s 	 	,	you	can	find	these	short	,	little	 glimps 	 es 	 	of	 moment 	 s 	 	and	 experience 	 s 	 	and	people	that	i	meet	.
and	,	you	know	,	after	 keep 	 ing 	 	these	 book 	 s 	 	for	a	number	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 collect 	 ing 	 	not	 on 	 ly 	 	my	own	personal	 artifact 	 s 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	the	 artifact 	 s 	 	of	other	people	.
so	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 collect 	 ing 	 	found	 object 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	photograph	i	found	 ly 	 ing 	 	in	a	 gutt 	 er 	 	in	new	york	city	about	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
on	the	front	,	you	can	see	the	 tat 	 ter 	 ed 	 	black	-	and	-	white	photo	of	a	woman	's	face	,	and	on	the	back	it	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	to	judy	,	the	girl	with	the	bill	bailey	voice	.	have	 f 	 un 	 	in	 what 	 ever 	 	you	do	.	``
and	i	 re 	 ally 	 	 love 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	the	partial	 glimps 	 e 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 body 	 	's	life	.	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	 know 	 ing 	 	the	whole	story	,	just	 know 	 ing 	 	a	little	bit	of	the	story	,	and	then	 lett 	 ing 	 	your	own	mind	fill	in	the	rest	.
and	that	idea	of	a	partial	 glimps 	 e 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	will	come	back	in	a	lot	of	the	work	i	'll	be	 show 	 ing 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
so	,	around	 th 	 is 	 	time	i	was	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	computer	science	at	princeton	university	,	and	i	 notice 	 d 	 	that	it	was	 sudden 	 ly 	 	possible	to	collect	these	 sort 	 s 	 	of	personal	 artifact 	 s 	 	,	not	just	from	street	 corner 	 s 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	from	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
and	that	 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	people	,	en	masse	,	 we 	 re 	 	 leav 	 ing 	 	 score 	 s 	 	and	 score 	 s 	 	of	digital	 foot 	 print 	 s 	 	 on 	 line 	 	that	told	 st 	 ories 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	private	 live 	 s 	 	.
blog	 post 	 s 	 	,	 photograph 	 s 	 	,	 thought 	 s 	 	,	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	 opinion 	 s 	 	,	all	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 express 	 ed 	 	by	people	 on 	 line 	 	,	and	 leav 	 ing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	 trail 	 s 	 	.
so	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	write	computer	 program 	 s 	 	that	 stud 	 y 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	large	 set 	 s 	 	of	these	 on 	 line 	 	 foot 	 print 	 s 	 	.
one	 s 	 uch 	 	project	is	about	a	year	and	a	half	old	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	we	feel	fine	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	project	that	 s 	 can 	 s 	 	the	world	's	 new 	 ly 	 	 post 	 ed 	 	blog	 ent 	 ries 	 	every	two	or	three	 minute 	 s 	 	,	 search 	 ing 	 	for	 occur 	 rence 	 s 	 	of	the	 phrase 	 s 	 	``	i	feel	``	and	``	i	am	 feel 	 ing 	 	.	``	and	when	it	 find 	 s 	 	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 phrase 	 s 	 	,	it	 grab 	 s 	 	the	full	sentence	up	to	the	period	and	 al 	 so 	 	tries	to	identify	 demo 	 graphic 	 	information	about	the	author	.
so	,	 the 	 ir 	 	gender	,	 the 	 ir 	 	age	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 geo 	 graphic 	 	location	and	what	the	weather	 condition 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	like	when	they	wrote	that	sentence	.
it	 collect 	 s 	 	about	20,000	 s 	 uch 	 	 sentence 	 s 	 	a	day	and	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	running	for	about	a	year	and	a	half	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	 collect 	 ed 	 	over	10	and	a	half	million	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	now	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	,	then	,	how	they	're	 present 	 ed 	 	.
these	 dot 	 s 	 	here	represent	some	of	the	english	-	 s 	 peaking 	 	world	's	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	from	the	last	few	 hour 	 s 	 	,
each	dot	 be 	 ing 	 	a	single	sentence	 state 	 d 	 	by	a	single	blogger	.
and	the	color	of	each	dot	 correspond 	 s 	 	to	the	type	of	 feel 	 ing 	 	 in 	 side 	 	,	so	the	bright	 one 	 s 	 	are	happy	,	and	the	dark	 one 	 s 	 	are	 s 	 ad 	 	.
and	the	 dia 	 meter 	 	of	each	dot	 correspond 	 s 	 	to	the	length	of	the	sentence	 in 	 side 	 	.
so	the	small	 one 	 s 	 	are	short	,	and	the	 big 	 ger 	 	 one 	 s 	 	are	 long 	 er 	 	.
``	i	feel	fine	with	the	body	i	'm	in	,	there	'll	be	no	easy	excuse	for	why	i	still	feel	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	close	to	my	boyfriend	,	``	from	a	twenty	-	two	-	year	-	old	in	japan	.
``	i	got	 th 	 is 	 	on	some	 tra 	 d 	 ing 	 	 local 	 ly 	 	,	but	 re 	 ally 	 	do	n't	feel	like	 screw 	 ing 	 	with	wiring	and	crap	.	``
 al 	 so 	 	,	some	of	the	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	contain	 photograph 	 s 	 	in	the	blog	 post 	 s 	 	.	and	when	that	 happen 	 s 	 	,	these	montage	 com 	 position 	 s 	 	are	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	 create 	 d 	 	,	which	consist	of	the	sentence	and	 image 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 combine 	 d 	 	.
and	any	of	these	can	be	 open 	 ed 	 	up	to	reveal	the	sentence	 in 	 side 	 	.
``	i	feel	good	.	``
``	i	feel	rough	now	,	and	i	 prob 	 ably 	 	 gain 	 ed 	 	100,000	 pound 	 s 	 	,	but	it	was	worth	it	.	``
``	i	love	how	they	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	preserve	most	in	 every 	 thing 	 	that	 make 	 s 	 	you	feel	close	to	nature	--	 butter 	 flies 	 	,	man	-	made	 forest 	 s 	 	,	 lime 	 stone 	 	 cave 	 s 	 	and	 he 	 y 	 	,	even	a	huge	python	.	``
so	the	next	 move 	 ment 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	 mob 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 provide 	 s 	 	a	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	more	 statistic 	 al 	 	look	at	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 show 	 ing 	 	the	world	's	most	common	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	 over 	 all 	 	right	now	,	 dominate 	 d 	 	by	better	,	then	bad	,	then	good	,	then	 guilt 	 y 	 	,	and	so	on	.
weather	 cause 	 s 	 	the	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	to	 assum 	 e 	 	the	physical	 trait 	 s 	 	of	the	weather	they	represent	.	so	the	 s 	 un 	 ny 	 	 one 	 s 	 	swirl	around	,	the	 cloud 	 y 	 	 one 	 s 	 	float	 a 	 long 	 	,	the	 rain 	 y 	 	 one 	 s 	 	fall	down	,	and	the	 snow 	 y 	 	 one 	 s 	 	 flut 	 ter 	 	to	the	ground	.
you	can	 al 	 so 	 	stop	a	 rain 	 drop 	 	and	open	the	 feel 	 ing 	 	 in 	 side 	 	.
 final 	 ly 	 	,	location	 cause 	 s 	 	the	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	to	move	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 spot 	 s 	 	on	a	world	map	,	giving	you	a	sense	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 geo 	 graphic 	 	 distribut 	 ion 	 	.
so	i	'll	show	you	now	some	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 montage 	 s 	 	from	``	we	feel	fine	.	``
these	are	the	 image 	 s 	 	that	are	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	 construct 	 ed 	 	.
``	i	feel	like	i	'm	 diagonal 	 ly 	 	 park 	 ed 	 	in	a	parallel	 uni 	 verse 	 	.	``
``	i	've	 kiss 	 ed 	 	 nume 	 r 	 ous 	 	other	 boy 	 s 	 	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	felt	good	,	the	 kiss 	 es 	 	felt	 mess 	 y 	 	and	wrong	,	but	 kiss 	 ing 	 	lucas	 feel 	 s 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	and	 al 	 most 	 	spiritual	.	``
``	i	can	feel	my	cancer	grow	.	``
``	i	feel	 pre 	 tty 	 	.	``
``	i	feel	 skin 	 ny 	 	,	but	i	'm	not	.	``
``	i	'm	23	,	and	a	 re 	 cover 	 ing 	 	 me 	 th 	 	and	 hero 	 in 	 	addict	,	and	feel	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 bless 	 ed 	 	to	still	be	 al 	 ive 	 	.	``
``	i	ca	n't	wait	to	see	them	 rac 	 ing 	 	for	the	first	time	at	daytona	next	month	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	feel	the	need	for	speed	.	``
``	i	feel	 s 	 ass 	 y 	 	.	``
``	i	feel	so	sexy	in	 th 	 is 	 	new	wig	.	``
 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	``	we	feel	fine	``	 collect 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	small	-	scale	personal	 st 	 ories 	 	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	 st 	 ories 	 	 a 	 s 	 	short	 a 	 s 	 	two	or	three	 word 	 s 	 	.
so	,	 re 	 ally 	 	even	 challeng 	 ing 	 	the	 not 	 ion 	 	of	what	can	be	 consider 	 ed 	 	a	story	.
and	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	i	've	 be 	 come 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 div 	 ing 	 	much	more	 deep 	 ly 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	single	story	.
and	that	's	led	me	to	 do 	 ing 	 	some	work	with	the	physical	world	,	not	with	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	and	 on 	 ly 	 	using	the	 inter 	 net 	 	at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	last	moment	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 present 	 ation 	 	medium	.
so	these	are	some	 new 	 er 	 	 project 	 s 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	are	n't	even	 launch 	 ed 	 	 public 	 ly 	 	yet	.
the	first	 s 	 uch 	 	one	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	whale	hunt	.	``	last	may	,	i	 s 	 pent 	 	nine	 day 	 s 	 	living	up	in	barrow	,	alaska	,	the	 north 	 ern 	 most 	 	 settle 	 ment 	 	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	with	a	family	of	inupiat	eskimos	,	 document 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	annual	spring	whale	hunt	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 whal 	 ing 	 	camp	here	,	we	're	about	six	 mile 	 s 	 	from	shore	,	 camp 	 ing 	 	on	five	and	a	half	feet	of	thick	,	 froze 	 n 	 	pack	ice	.
and	that	water	that	you	see	there	is	the	open	lead	,	and	through	that	lead	,	 bow 	 head 	 	 whale 	 s 	 	 migr 	 ate 	 	north	each	 spring 	 time 	 	.
and	the	eskimo	community	 bas 	 ically 	 	 camp 	 s 	 	out	on	the	edge	of	the	ice	here	,	 wait 	 s 	 	for	a	whale	to	come	close	 en 	 ough 	 	to	attack	.	and	when	it	 do 	 es 	 	,	it	 throw 	 s 	 	a	 harp 	 oon 	 	at	it	,	and	then	 haul 	 s 	 	the	whale	up	under	the	ice	,	and	 cut 	 s 	 	it	up	.
and	that	would	provide	the	community	's	food	supply	for	a	long	time	.
so	i	went	up	there	,	and	i	lived	with	these	 guy 	 s 	 	out	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 whal 	 ing 	 	camp	here	,	and	 photograph 	 ed 	 	the	entire	experience	,	 begin 	 ning 	 	with	the	taxi	ride	to	newark	 air 	 port 	 	in	new	york	,	and	 end 	 ing 	 	with	the	 butcher 	 ing 	 	of	the	second	whale	,	seven	and	a	half	 day 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
i	 photograph 	 ed 	 	that	entire	experience	at	five	-	minute	 inter 	 val 	 s 	 	.
so	every	five	 minute 	 s 	 	,	i	took	a	photograph	.
when	i	was	awake	,	with	the	camera	around	my	neck	.	when	i	was	 sleep 	 ing 	 	,	with	a	 tri 	 pod 	 	and	a	timer	.
and	then	in	 moment 	 s 	 	of	high	 adrenalin 	 e 	 	,	like	when	 some 	 thing 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	,	i	would	up	that	 photograph 	 ic 	 	frequency	to	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 a 	 s 	 	37	 photograph 	 s 	 	in	five	 minute 	 s 	 	.
so	what	 th 	 is 	 	 create 	 d 	 	was	a	 photograph 	 ic 	 	 heart 	 beat 	 	that	 s 	 ped 	 	up	and	 s 	 low 	 ed 	 	down	,	more	or	less	 match 	 ing 	 	the	changing	pace	of	my	own	 heart 	 beat 	 	.
that	was	the	first	 con 	 cept 	 	here	.
the	second	 con 	 cept 	 	was	to	use	 th 	 is 	 	experience	to	think	about	the	fundamental	 component 	 s 	 	of	any	story	.
what	are	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	make	up	a	story	?
so	,	 st 	 ories 	 	have	 character 	 s 	 	.	 st 	 ories 	 	have	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	.
 st 	 ories 	 	take	place	in	a	certain	area	.	they	have	 con 	 text 	 s 	 	.
they	have	 color 	 s 	 	.	what	do	they	look	like	?
they	have	time	.	when	did	it	take	place	?	 date 	 s 	 	--	when	did	it	occur	?
and	in	the	case	of	the	whale	hunt	,	 al 	 so 	 	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	an	 excit 	 ement 	 	level	.
the	thing	about	 st 	 ories 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	in	most	of	the	 exist 	 ing 	 	 medium 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 ac 	 custom 	 ed 	 	to	--	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 novel 	 s 	 	,	radio	,	 photograph 	 s 	 	,	 movie 	 s 	 	,	even	 lectur 	 es 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	one	--	we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 ac 	 custom 	 ed 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	the	 nar 	 rator 	 	or	the	camera	position	,
some	kind	of	 omni 	 scient 	 	,	external	body	through	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	you	see	the	story	.
we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	used	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	if	you	think	about	real	life	,	it	's	not	like	that	at	all	.
i	mean	,	in	real	life	,	 thing 	 s 	 	are	much	more	 nuance 	 d 	 	and	complex	,	and	there	's	all	of	these	 over 	 lap 	 ping 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	 intersect 	 ing 	 	and	 touch 	 ing 	 	each	other	.
and	so	i	thought	it	would	be	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	build	a	 frame 	 work 	 	to	surface	 t 	 hose 	 	 type 	 s 	 	of	 st 	 ories 	 	.	so	,	in	the	case	of	``	the	whale	hunt	,	``	how	could	we	 ex 	 tract 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	the	story	of	simeon	and	crawford	,	 in 	 vol 	 v 	 ing 	 	the	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	of	 wild 	 life 	 	,	 tool 	 s 	 	and	blood	,	taking	place	on	the	 arc 	 tic 	 	ocean	,	 dominate 	 d 	 	by	the	color	red	,	 happen 	 ing 	 	around	10	 a.m 	 . 	 	on	may	3	,	with	an	 excit 	 ement 	 	level	of	high	?
so	,	how	to	 ex 	 tract 	 	 th 	 is 	 	order	of	narrative	from	 th 	 is 	 	 large 	 r 	 	story	?
i	built	a	web	 inter 	 face 	 	for	 view 	 ing 	 	``	the	whale	hunt	``	that	 attempt 	 s 	 	to	do	just	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	these	are	all	3,214	 picture 	 s 	 	taken	up	there	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	my	studio	in	brooklyn	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 arc 	 tic 	 	ocean	,	and	the	 butcher 	 ing 	 	of	the	second	whale	,	seven	 day 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
you	can	start	to	see	some	of	the	story	here	,	told	by	color	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	red	strip	 sign 	 ifies 	 	the	color	of	the	 wall 	 paper 	 	in	the	 base 	 ment 	 	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	where	i	was	 stay 	 ing 	 	.
and	 thing 	 s 	 	go	white	 a 	 s 	 	we	move	out	onto	the	 arc 	 tic 	 	ocean	.
 introduc 	 tion 	 	of	red	down	here	,	when	 whale 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	cut	up	.
you	can	see	a	 time 	 line 	 	,	 show 	 ing 	 	you	the	 excit 	 ing 	 	 moment 	 s 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	story	.
these	are	 organize 	 d 	 	 chrono 	 logically 	 	.
wheel	 provide 	 s 	 	a	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	more	 play 	 ful 	 	version	of	the	same	,	so	these	are	 al 	 so 	 	all	the	 photograph 	 s 	 	 organize 	 d 	 	 chrono 	 logically 	 	.
and	any	of	these	can	be	 click 	 ed 	 	,	and	then	the	narrative	is	 enter 	 ed 	 	at	that	position	.
so	here	i	am	 sleep 	 ing 	 	on	the	 air 	 plane 	 	 head 	 ing 	 	up	to	alaska	.
that	's	``	moby	 d 	 ick 	 	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	food	we	ate	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	in	the	patkotak	's	family	living	room	in	 the 	 ir 	 	house	in	barrow	.	the	 box 	 ed 	 	wine	they	 serv 	 ed 	 	us	.

 th 	 is 	 	is	out	at	whale	camp	,	on	the	 arc 	 tic 	 	ocean	.

 th 	 is 	 	is	the	ice	 start 	 ing 	 	to	freeze	over	.	the	snow	 f 	 ence 	 	they	built	.
and	so	what	i	'll	show	you	now	is	the	ability	to	pull	out	sub	-	 st 	 ories 	 	.
so	,	here	you	see	the	cast	.	these	are	all	of	the	people	in	``	the	whale	hunt	``	and	the	two	 whale 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 kill 	 ed 	 	down	here	.
and	we	could	do	 some 	 thing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 arbitr 	 ary 	 	 a 	 s 	 	,	say	,	 ex 	 tract 	 	the	story	of	rony	,	 in 	 vol 	 v 	 ing 	 	the	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	of	blood	and	 whale 	 s 	 	and	 tool 	 s 	 	,	taking	place	on	the	 arc 	 tic 	 	ocean	,	at	ahkivgaq	camp	,	with	the	 heart 	 beat 	 	level	of	fast	.
and	now	we	've	 whittl 	 ed 	 	down	that	whole	story	to	just	29	 match 	 ing 	 	 photograph 	 s 	 	,	and	then	we	can	enter	the	narrative	at	that	position	.
and	you	can	see	rony	cutting	up	the	whale	here	.
these	 whale 	 s 	 	are	about	40	feet	long	,	and	 weigh 	 ing 	 	over	40	 ton 	 s 	 	.	and	they	provide	the	food	source	for	the	community	for	much	of	the	year	.
 skip 	 ping 	 	 a 	 head 	 	a	bit	more	here	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	rony	on	the	whale	 car 	 cass 	 	.
they	use	no	 chain 	 saw 	 s 	 	or	 any 	 thing 	 	;	it	's	 entire 	 ly 	 	just	 blade 	 s 	 	,	and	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	efficient	process	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 guy 	 s 	 	on	the	rope	,	 pull 	 ing 	 	open	the	 car 	 cass 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	muktuk	,	or	the	 blu 	 b 	 ber 	 	,	all	lined	up	for	community	 distribut 	 ion 	 	.
it	's	 bale 	 en 	 	.	moving	on	.
so	what	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	about	next	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	new	thing	.	it	's	not	even	a	project	yet	.
so	,	just	 yester 	 day 	 	,	i	flew	in	here	from	singapore	,	and	before	that	,	i	was	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	two	 week 	 s 	 	in	bhutan	,	the	small	himalayan	 king 	 dom 	 	 nest 	 led 	 	between	tibet	and	india	.
and	i	was	 do 	 ing 	 	a	project	there	about	happiness	,	 interview 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	local	people	.
so	bhutan	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 wack 	 y 	 	thing	where	they	base	most	of	 the 	 ir 	 	high	-	level	 government 	 al 	 	 decision 	 s 	 	around	the	 con 	 cept 	 	of	gross	national	happiness	 in 	 stead 	 	of	gross	domestic	product	,	and	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	since	the	'70s	.
and	it	 lead 	 s 	 	to	just	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	value	system	.
it	's	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	non	-	 material 	 istic 	 	culture	,	where	people	do	n't	have	a	lot	,	but	they	're	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	happy	.
so	i	went	around	and	i	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	people	about	some	of	these	 idea 	 s 	 	.
so	,	i	did	a	number	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	people	a	number	of	set	 question 	 s 	 	,	and	took	a	number	of	set	 photograph 	 s 	 	,	and	 interview 	 ed 	 	them	with	audio	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	took	 picture 	 s 	 	.
i	would	start	by	 ask 	 ing 	 	people	to	rate	 the 	 ir 	 	happiness	between	one	and	10	,	which	is	kind	of	 inherent 	 ly 	 	absurd	.
and	then	when	they	 answer 	 ed 	 	,	i	would	 infla 	 te 	 	that	number	of	 balloon 	 s 	 	and	give	them	that	number	of	 balloon 	 s 	 	to	hold	.
so	,	you	have	some	 re 	 ally 	 	happy	person	 hold 	 ing 	 	10	 balloon 	 s 	 	,	and	some	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 ad 	 	soul	 hold 	 ing 	 	one	balloon	.
but	you	know	,	even	 hold 	 ing 	 	one	balloon	is	like	,	kind	of	happy	.
and	then	i	would	ask	them	a	number	of	 question 	 s 	 	like	what	was	the	 hap 	 pies 	 t 	 	day	in	 the 	 ir 	 	life	,	what	 make 	 s 	 	them	happy	.
and	then	 final 	 ly 	 	,	i	would	ask	them	to	make	a	wish	.
and	when	they	made	a	wish	,	i	would	write	 the 	 ir 	 	wish	onto	one	of	the	 balloon 	 s 	 	and	take	a	picture	of	them	 hold 	 ing 	 	it	.
so	i	'm	going	to	show	you	now	just	a	few	brief	 snip 	 pet 	 s 	 	of	some	of	the	 interview 	 s 	 	that	i	did	,	some	of	the	people	i	spoke	with	.

and	up	there	,	there	are	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 pray 	 er 	 	 flag 	 s 	 	that	people	have	spread	out	over	the	 year 	 s 	 	.
and	we	re	-	inflated	all	of	the	 balloon 	 s 	 	,	put	them	up	on	a	string	,	and	hung	them	up	there	among	the	 pray 	 er 	 	 flag 	 s 	 	.
and	they	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	still	 fly 	 ing 	 	up	there	 to 	 day 	 	.
