marco	tempest	:	what	i	'd	like	to	show	you	 to 	 day 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	in	the	way	of	an	experiment	.
 to 	 day 	 	's	 it 	 s 	 	debut	.
it	's	a	 demonst 	 ration 	 	of	 augment 	 ed 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	.
and	the	 visual 	 s 	 	you	're	about	to	see	are	not	prerecorded	.
they	are	live	and	 react 	 ing 	 	to	me	in	real	time	.
i	like	to	think	of	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	 techno 	 logical 	 	magic	.
so	 finger 	 s 	 	 cross 	 ed 	 	.	and	keep	your	 eye 	 s 	 	on	the	big	screen	.
 augment 	 ed 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	is	the	 meld 	 ing 	 	of	the	real	world	with	computer	-	generated	 image 	 ry 	 	.
it	 seem 	 s 	 	the	perfect	medium	to	investigate	magic	and	ask	,	why	,	in	a	 techno 	 logical 	 	age	,	we	 continu 	 e 	 	to	have	 th 	 is 	 	 magic 	 al 	 	sense	of	wonder	.
magic	is	 de 	 ception 	 	,	but	it	is	a	 de 	 ception 	 	we	enjoy	.
to	enjoy	 be 	 ing 	 	 deceive 	 d 	 	,	an	audience	must	first	suspend	 it 	 s 	 	 dis 	 belief 	 	.
it	was	the	poet	samuel	taylor	coleridge	who	first	 suggest 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	receptive	state	of	mind	.
samuel	taylor	coleridge	:	i	try	to	convey	a	semblance	of	truth	in	my	writing	to	produce	for	these	 shadow 	 s 	 	of	the	 imagin 	 ation 	 	a	 will 	 ing 	 	 s 	 us 	 pension 	 	of	 dis 	 belief 	 	that	,	for	a	moment	,	 constitute 	 s 	 	 poet 	 ic 	 	faith	.
mt	:	 th 	 is 	 	faith	in	the	 fiction 	 al 	 	is	essential	for	any	kind	of	 the 	 a 	 tric 	 al 	 	experience	.
 with 	 out 	 	it	,	a	script	is	just	 word 	 s 	 	.
 augment 	 ed 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	is	just	the	 lat 	 est 	 	technology	.
and	 s 	 l 	 eight 	 	of	hand	is	just	an	 art 	 ful 	 	 demonst 	 ration 	 	of	 dexter 	 ity 	 	.
we	are	all	 ver 	 y 	 	good	at	 suspend 	 ing 	 	our	 dis 	 belief 	 	.
we	do	it	every	day	,	while	 read 	 ing 	 	 novel 	 s 	 	,	 watch 	 ing 	 	 tele 	 vision 	 	or	going	to	the	 movie 	 s 	 	.
we	 will 	 ing 	 ly 	 	enter	 fiction 	 al 	 	 world 	 s 	 	where	we	cheer	our	heroes	and	cry	for	 friend 	 s 	 	we	never	had	.
 with 	 out 	 	 th 	 is 	 	ability	there	is	no	magic	.
it	was	jean	robert	-	houdin	,	france	's	 great 	 est 	 	 illusion 	 ist 	 	,	who	first	 recogn 	 ized 	 	the	role	of	the	 magic 	 ian 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 story 	 teller 	 	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	've	 post 	 ed 	 	on	the	wall	of	my	studio	.
jean	robert	-	houdin	:	a	 conjure 	 r 	 	is	not	a	juggler	.
he	is	an	 a 	 ctor 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	the	part	of	a	 magic 	 ian 	 	.
mt	:	which	 mean 	 s 	 	magic	is	theater	and	every	trick	is	a	story	.
the	 trick 	 s 	 	of	magic	follow	the	 arche 	 type 	 s 	 	of	narrative	fiction	.
there	are	 tale 	 s 	 	of	creation	and	loss	,	death	and	 resurrect 	 ion 	 	,	and	 obstacle 	 s 	 	that	must	be	 over 	 come 	 	.
now	 man 	 y 	 	of	them	are	 intens 	 e 	 ly 	 	 dramat 	 ic 	 	.
 magic 	 ians 	 	play	with	fire	and	steel	,	defy	the	 fur 	 y 	 	of	the	buzzsaw	,	 da 	 re 	 	to	catch	a	bullet	or	attempt	a	 dead 	 ly 	 	 es 	 cape 	 	.
but	 audience 	 s 	 	do	n't	come	to	see	the	 magic 	 ian 	 	die	,	they	come	to	see	him	live	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	best	 st 	 ories 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	have	a	happy	 end 	 ing 	 	.
the	 trick 	 s 	 	of	magic	have	one	special	element	.
they	are	 st 	 ories 	 	with	a	twist	.
now	edward	de	bono	 argu 	 ed 	 	that	our	 brain 	 s 	 	are	pattern	 match 	 ing 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	that	 magic 	 ians 	 	 de 	 liberate 	 ly 	 	exploit	the	way	 the 	 ir 	 	 audience 	 s 	 	think	.
edward	de	bono	:	stage	magic	 re 	 lies 	 	 al 	 most 	 	 who 	 lly 	 	on	the	 moment 	 um 	 	error	.
the	audience	is	led	to	make	 assumption 	 s 	 	or	elaborations	that	are	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 reason 	 able 	 	,	but	do	not	,	in	fact	,	match	what	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	in	front	of	them	.
mt	:	in	that	respect	,	magic	 trick 	 s 	 	are	like	 joke 	 s 	 	.
 joke 	 s 	 	lead	us	down	a	path	to	an	 expect 	 ed 	 	destination	.
but	when	the	scenario	we	have	 imagin 	 ed 	 	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 flip 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 entire 	 ly 	 	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	,	we	laugh	.
the	same	thing	 happen 	 s 	 	when	people	watch	magic	 trick 	 s 	 	.
the	 final 	 e 	 	 defi 	 es 	 	logic	,	 give 	 s 	 	new	 in 	 sight 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	problem	,	and	 audience 	 s 	 	express	 the 	 ir 	 	 amaze 	 ment 	 	with	laughter	.
it	's	 f 	 un 	 	to	be	 fool 	 ed 	 	.
one	of	the	key	 qual 	 ities 	 	of	all	 st 	 ories 	 	is	that	they	're	made	to	be	 share 	 d 	 	.
we	feel	 compel 	 led 	 	to	tell	them	.
when	i	do	a	trick	at	a	party	--	that	person	will	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	pull	 the 	 ir 	 	friend	over	and	ask	me	to	do	it	 aga 	 in 	 	.
they	want	to	share	the	experience	.
that	 make 	 s 	 	my	job	more	difficult	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	if	i	want	to	surprise	them	,	i	need	to	tell	a	story	that	 start 	 s 	 	the	same	,	but	 end 	 s 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	--	a	trick	with	a	twist	on	a	twist	.
it	 keep 	 s 	 	me	 bus 	 y 	 	.
now	 expert 	 s 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 st 	 ories 	 	go	beyond	our	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	for	 keep 	 ing 	 	us	 entertain 	 ed 	 	.
we	think	in	narrative	 structure 	 s 	 	.
we	connect	 event 	 s 	 	and	 emotion 	 s 	 	and	 instinct 	 ively 	 	transform	them	 in 	 to 	 	a	sequence	that	can	be	 eas 	 ily 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	.
it	's	a	 un 	 ique 	 ly 	 	human	 achiev 	 ement 	 	.
we	all	want	to	share	our	 st 	 ories 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	is	the	trick	we	saw	at	the	party	,	the	bad	day	at	the	 off 	 ice 	 	or	the	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 s 	 un 	 set 	 	we	saw	on	 vac 	 ation 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	 thank 	 s 	 	to	technology	,	we	can	share	 t 	 hose 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	 a 	 s 	 	never	before	,	by	email	,	facebook	,	 blog 	 s 	 	,	 tweet 	 s 	 	,	on	ted.com	.
the	 tool 	 s 	 	of	social	 network 	 ing 	 	,	these	are	the	digital	 camp 	 fire 	 s 	 	around	which	the	audience	 gather 	 s 	 	to	hear	our	story	.
we	turn	 fact 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	similes	and	 metaphor 	 s 	 	,	and	even	 fanta 	 s 	 ies 	 	.
we	polish	the	rough	 edge 	 s 	 	of	our	 live 	 s 	 	so	that	they	feel	whole	.
our	 st 	 ories 	 	make	us	the	people	we	are	and	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	the	people	we	want	to	be	.
they	give	us	our	 ident 	 ity 	 	and	a	sense	of	community	.
and	if	the	story	is	a	good	one	,	it	might	even	make	us	 s 	 mile 	 	.
thank	you	.
thank	you	.
