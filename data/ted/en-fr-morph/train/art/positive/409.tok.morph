the	north	coast	of	california	 ha 	 s 	 	 rain 	 forest 	 s 	 	--	 temper 	 ate 	 	 rain 	 forest 	 s 	 	--	where	it	can	rain	more	than	100	 inch 	 es 	 	a	year	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	realm	of	the	coast	 red 	 wood 	 	tree	.	 it 	 s 	 	species	name	is	sequoia	sempervirens	.
sequoia	sempervirens	is	the	 tall 	 est 	 	living	organism	on	earth	.
the	range	of	the	species	 go 	 es 	 	up	to	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	380	feet	tall	.
that	's	38	 st 	 ories 	 	tall	.
these	are	 tree 	 s 	 	that	would	stand	out	in	 mid 	 town 	 	manhattan	.
 no 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	how	old	the	 old 	 est 	 	living	coast	 red 	 wood 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 cause 	 	 no 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	 drill 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	any	of	them	to	count	 the 	 ir 	 	annual	growth	 ring 	 s 	 	,	and	,	in	any	case	,	the	 center 	 s 	 	of	the	 old 	 est 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	appear	to	be	hollow	.
but	it	's	 believ 	 ed 	 	that	the	 old 	 est 	 	living	 red 	 wood 	 s 	 	are	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	2,500	 year 	 s 	 	old	--	 rough 	 ly 	 	the	age	of	the	parthenon	--	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 suspect 	 ed 	 	that	there	may	be	individual	 tree 	 s 	 	that	are	 old 	 er 	 	than	that	.
you	can	see	the	range	of	the	coast	 red 	 wood 	 s 	 	.	it	's	here	,	in	red	.
the	largest	 individual 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	species	,	the	 dread 	 noughts 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	kind	,	live	just	on	the	north	coast	of	california	,	where	the	rain	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 intens 	 e 	 	.
in	 re 	 cent 	 	historic	 time 	 s 	 	,	about	96	percent	of	the	coast	 red 	 wood 	 	forest	was	cut	down	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	in	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 burst 	 s 	 	of	 intens 	 e 	 	 liquid 	 ation 	 	logging	,	clear	-	cutting	that	took	place	in	the	1970s	through	the	early	1990s	.
even	so	,	about	four	percent	of	the	 prime 	 val 	 	 red 	 wood 	 	 rain 	 forest 	 	 remain 	 s 	 	 in 	 tact 	 	,	wild	and	now	 protect 	 ed 	 	--	 entire 	 ly 	 	 protect 	 ed 	 	--	in	a	chain	of	small	 park 	 s 	 	 st 	 rung 	 	out	like	 pearl 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	the	north	coast	of	california	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 red 	 wood 	 	national	park	.

i	'm	going	to	do	a	little	gedanken	experiment	.

and	 may 	 be 	 	about	here	,	about	30	feet	,	is	the	 dia 	 meter 	 	of	a	big	 red 	 wood 	 	.
now	,	let	your	 imagin 	 ation 	 	go	 up 	 ward 	 	 in 	 to 	 	space	.
think	about	 th 	 is 	 	tree	,	 ris 	 ing 	 	 up 	 ward 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 red 	 wood 	 	space	,	325	feet	,	32	 st 	 ories 	 	,	an	individual	living	organism	 articul 	 ating 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 form 	 s 	 	 up 	 ward 	 	 in 	 to 	 	space	over	long	 period 	 s 	 	of	time	.
the	 red 	 wood 	 	species	 seem 	 s 	 	to	exist	in	 an 	 other 	 	kind	of	time	:	not	human	time	,	but	what	we	might	call	 red 	 wood 	 	time	.
 red 	 wood 	 	time	 move 	 s 	 	at	a	more	 state 	 ly 	 	pace	than	human	time	.
to	us	,	when	we	look	at	a	 red 	 wood 	 	tree	,	it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	 motion 	 less 	 	and	still	,	and	yet	 red 	 wood 	 s 	 	are	 constant 	 ly 	 	in	motion	,	moving	 up 	 ward 	 	 in 	 to 	 	space	,	 articul 	 ating 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	 fill 	 ing 	 	 red 	 wood 	 	space	over	 red 	 wood 	 	time	,	over	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	.

and	yet	,	when	you	look	at	the	base	of	a	 red 	 wood 	 	tree	,	you	're	not	 see 	 ing 	 	the	organism	.
you	're	like	a	mouse	looking	at	the	foot	of	an	elephant	,	and	most	of	the	organism	is	 over 	 head 	 	,	 un 	 s 	 een 	 	.
i	 be 	 came 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	,	and	i	wrote	about	a	couple	.
steve	sillett	and	marie	antoine	are	the	principal	 explore 	 rs 	 	of	the	 red 	 wood 	 	forest	 can 	 opy 	 	.	they	're	world	-	class	 athlete 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 al 	 so 	 	are	world	-	class	forest	 eco 	 logy 	 	 scientist 	 s 	 	.
steve	sillett	,	when	he	was	a	19	-	year	-	old	college	student	at	 re 	 ed 	 	college	,	had	heard	that	the	 red 	 wood 	 	forest	 can 	 opy 	 	is	 consider 	 ed 	 	to	be	a	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	 red 	 wood 	 	desert	.
that	is	to	say	,	at	that	time	it	was	 believ 	 ed 	 	that	there	was	 noth 	 ing 	 	up	there	 ex 	 cept 	 	the	 branch 	 es 	 	of	 red 	 wood 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	.
and	with	a	friend	of	his	,	he	took	it	 up 	 on 	 	 him 	 self 	 	to	free	-	climb	a	 red 	 wood 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 rope 	 s 	 	or	any	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	to	see	what	was	up	there	.
he	 climb 	 ed 	 	up	a	small	tree	next	to	 th 	 is 	 	giant	 red 	 wood 	 	,	and	then	he	 leap 	 ed 	 	through	space	and	 grab 	 bed 	 	a	branch	with	his	 hand 	 s 	 	,	and	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 hang 	 ing 	 	,	like	 catch 	 ing 	 	a	bar	of	a	 trap 	 e 	 ze 	 	.
and	then	,	from	there	,	he	 climb 	 ed 	 	 direct 	 ly 	 	up	the	bark	 un 	 til 	 	he	got	to	the	top	of	the	tree	.
his	friend	,	a	guy	named	marwood	harris	,	was	 follow 	 ing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	.
 n 	 either 	 	one	of	them	had	 notice 	 d 	 	that	there	was	a	yellow	jacket	wasp	's	nest	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	 bowl 	 ing 	 	ball	 hang 	 ing 	 	from	the	branch	that	steve	had	 jump 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	.
and	when	marwood	made	the	jump	,	he	was	 cover 	 ed 	 	with	 wasp 	 s 	 	 s 	 ting 	 ing 	 	him	in	the	face	and	 eye 	 s 	 	.	he	 near 	 ly 	 	let	go	.
he	would	have	 fall 	 en 	 	to	his	death	,	 be 	 ing 	 	75	feet	above	the	ground	.
but	they	made	it	to	the	top	,	and	what	they	found	was	not	a	 red 	 wood 	 	desert	,	but	a	lost	world	--	a	kind	of	three	-	dimensional	labyrinth	in	the	air	,	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	 un 	 known 	 	life	.

that	's	my	son	,	oliver	.

all	other	 prim 	 ates 	 	,	when	they	're	 scar 	 ed 	 	,	they	run	up	a	tree	,	where	they	feel	safe	.
we	 camp 	 ed 	 	 over 	 night 	 	in	the	 tree 	 s 	 	,	in	tree	 boat 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	my	daughter	laura	,	then	15	,	looking	out	of	a	tree	boat	.

it	 be 	 came 	 	a	writing	project	.
when	steve	sillett	 get 	 s 	 	up	 in 	 to 	 	a	big	 red 	 wood 	 	,	he	 fire 	 s 	 	an	arrow	,	which	 trail 	 s 	 	a	 fish 	 ing 	 	line	,	which	 get 	 s 	 	over	a	branch	in	the	tree	,	and	then	you	ascend	up	a	rope	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 drag 	 ged 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	tree	by	the	line	.
you	ascend	30	 st 	 ories 	 	.
there	are	two	people	 climb 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	tree	,	gaya	,	which	is	thought	to	be	one	of	the	 old 	 est 	 	 red 	 wood 	 s 	 	.	there	they	are	.
they	are	 on 	 ly 	 	one	-	 seven 	 th 	 	of	the	way	up	that	tree	.
you	do	feel	a	sense	of	 expo 	 s 	 ure 	 	.
there	is	a	small	person	right	down	there	on	the	ground	.
you	feel	like	you	're	 climb 	 ing 	 	a	wall	of	wood	.
but	then	you	enter	the	 red 	 wood 	 	 can 	 opy 	 	,	and	it	's	like	coming	through	a	layer	of	 cloud 	 s 	 	.
and	all	of	a	sudden	,	you	lose	sight	of	the	ground	,	and	you	 al 	 so 	 	lose	sight	of	the	sky	,	and	you	're	in	a	three	-	dimensional	labyrinth	in	the	air	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	 hang 	 ing 	 	 garden 	 s 	 	of	 fer 	 ns 	 	growing	out	of	 s 	 oil 	 	,	which	is	 populate 	 d 	 	with	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	small	 organism 	 s 	 	.
there	are	 epiphyte 	 s 	 	,	 plant 	 s 	 	that	grow	on	 tree 	 s 	 	.
these	are	 huckle 	 berry 	 	 bush 	 es 	 	.
 man 	 y 	 	species	of	 moss 	 es 	 	,	and	then	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 lic 	 hens 	 	just	 plast 	 er 	 ing 	 	the	tree	.
when	you	get	near	the	top	of	the	tree	,	you	feel	like	you	ca	n't	fall	--	in	fact	,	it	's	difficult	to	move	.
you	're	 worm 	 ing 	 	your	way	through	 branch 	 es 	 	which	are	 crowd 	 ed 	 	with	living	 thing 	 s 	 	that	do	n't	occur	near	the	ground	.
it	's	like	scuba	 div 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	coral	reef	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	you	're	going	 up 	 ward 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 down 	 ward 	 	.
and	then	the	 tree 	 s 	 	tend	to	flare	out	 in 	 to 	 	platform	-	like	 area 	 s 	 	at	the	top	.
maria	's	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	on	one	of	them	.
these	 limb 	 s 	 	could	be	five	to	six	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
 red 	 wood 	 s 	 	grow	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 top 	 s 	 	.
they	 al 	 so 	 	have	a	feature	:	 thick 	 et 	 s 	 	of	 huckle 	 berry 	 	 bush 	 es 	 	that	grow	out	of	the	 top 	 s 	 	of	 red 	 wood 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	that	are	 technical 	 ly 	 	known	 a 	 s 	 	 huckle 	 berry 	 	 afro 	 s 	 	,
and	you	can	 s 	 it 	 	there	and	snack	on	the	berries	while	you	're	 rest 	 ing 	 	.
 red 	 wood 	 s 	 	have	an	enormous	surface	area	that	 extend 	 s 	 	 up 	 ward 	 	 in 	 to 	 	space	 be 	 cause 	 	they	have	a	 prop 	 en 	 s 	 ity 	 	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 re 	 iteration 	 	.
a	 red 	 wood 	 	is	a	 fract 	 al 	 	.	and	 a 	 s 	 	they	put	out	 limb 	 s 	 	,	the	 limb 	 s 	 	burst	 in 	 to 	 	small	 tree 	 s 	 	,	copies	of	the	 red 	 wood 	 	.
now	,	here	we	see	a	 re 	 iteration 	 	in	chronos	,	one	of	the	 old 	 er 	 	 red 	 wood 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 iteration 	 	is	a	huge	 fly 	 ing 	 	buttress	that	 come 	 s 	 	out	the	tree	 it 	 self 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	buttress	is	less	than	 half 	 way 	 	up	the	tree	.
and	then	it	 burst 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	forest	of	 red 	 wood 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	extra	trunk	is	a	meter	 a 	 cross 	 	at	the	base	and	 extend 	 s 	 	 up 	 ward 	 	for	150	feet	.
it	's	 a 	 s 	 	big	 a 	 s 	 	any	of	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	east	of	the	mississippi	river	,	and	yet	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	a	minor	feature	on	chronos	.
 th 	 is 	 	three	-	dimensional	map	of	the	crown	structure	of	a	 red 	 wood 	 	named	iluvatar	,	made	by	steve	sillett	,	marie	antoine	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	,	 give 	 s 	 	you	an	idea	.
what	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	here	is	a	 hierarch 	 ical 	 	schematic	 develop 	 ment 	 	of	the	 trunk 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	tree	 a 	 s 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 elaborate 	 d 	 	 it 	 self 	 	over	time	 in 	 to 	 	six	 layer 	 s 	 	of	 fract 	 al 	 	,	of	 trunk 	 s 	 	 spring 	 ing 	 	from	 trunk 	 s 	 	 spring 	 ing 	 	from	 trunk 	 s 	 	.
i	 ask 	 ed 	 	steve	to	put	a	human	 be 	 ing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	to	give	a	sense	of	scale	.
there	's	the	person	,	right	there	.	the	person	is	 wav 	 ing 	 	to	us	.
i	've	 want 	 ed 	 	to	ask	craig	venter	if	it	would	be	possible	to	insert	a	synthetic	 chromosom 	 e 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	human	so	that	we	could	reiterate	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	if	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	.
and	if	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	reiterate	,	then	the	 finger 	 s 	 	of	our	hand	would	be	people	who	 look 	 ed 	 	like	us	,	and	they	would	have	people	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	and	so	on	.
and	if	we	had	 red 	 wood 	 	-	like	biology	,	we	would	have	six	 layer 	 s 	 	of	people	on	our	 hand 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 we 	 re 	 	.
and	it	would	be	a	 love 	 ly 	 	thing	to	be	able	to	wave	to	 some 	 one 	 	and	have	all	our	 re 	 iteration 	 s 	 	wave	at	the	same	time	.
to	reiterate	the	point	,	let	's	go	 close 	 r 	 	 in 	 to 	 	iluvatar	.
we	're	looking	at	that	yellow	box	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 hallucin 	 atory 	 	 draw 	 ing 	 	 show 	 s 	 	you	--	 every 	 thing 	 	you	see	in	 th 	 is 	 	 draw 	 ing 	 	is	iluvatar	.
these	are	 millennia 	 l 	 	 structure 	 s 	 	--	 port 	 ions 	 	of	the	tree	that	are	 believ 	 ed 	 	to	be	more	than	1,000	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
there	are	four	 human 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	shot	--	one	,	two	,	three	,	four	.
and	there	's	 al 	 so 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	want	to	show	you	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 fly 	 ing 	 	buttress	.
 red 	 wood 	 s 	 	grow	back	 in 	 to 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	expand	 in 	 to 	 	space	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 fly 	 ing 	 	buttress	is	a	limb	shot	out	of	that	small	trunk	,	going	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	main	trunk	and	fusing	with	it	.
 fly 	 ing 	 	 buttress 	 es 	 	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	in	a	 cat 	 hedral 	 	,	help	 strength 	 en 	 	the	crown	of	the	tree	and	help	the	tree	exist	 long 	 er 	 	through	time	.
the	 scientist 	 s 	 	are	 do 	 ing 	 	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 experiment 	 s 	 	in	these	 tree 	 s 	 	.
they	've	wired	them	like	 patient 	 s 	 	in	an	icu	.
they	're	 find 	 ing 	 	out	that	 red 	 wood 	 s 	 	can	move	 moist 	 ure 	 	out	of	the	air	and	down	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 trunk 	 s 	 	,	possibly	all	the	way	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	root	 system 	 s 	 	.

if	we	had	 red 	 wood 	 	-	like	biology	,	if	we	got	a	touch	of	 gang 	 rene 	 	in	our	arm	then	we	could	just	,	you	know	,	 ex 	 tract 	 	the	 nutrient 	 s 	 	 ex 	 tract 	 	the	 nutrient 	 s 	 	and	the	 moist 	 ure 	 	out	of	it	 un 	 til 	 	it	fell	off	.

there	are	some	 interest 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ories 	 	that	,	if	i	had	time	,	i	would	tell	you	about	.
but	 a 	 s 	 	you	go	and	you	look	 close 	 r 	 	at	a	tree	,	what	you	see	is	,	you	see	increasing	 complex 	 ity 	 	.
we	're	looking	at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	top	of	gaya	,	which	is	thought	to	be	the	 old 	 est 	 	 red 	 wood 	 	.
gaya	may	be	3,000	to	5,000	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	no	one	 re 	 ally 	 	 know 	 s 	 	,	but	 it 	 s 	 	top	 ha 	 s 	 	broken	off	and	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 rot 	 ting 	 	back	now	.
 th 	 is 	 	little	japanese	garden	-	like	creation	 prob 	 ably 	 	took	700	 year 	 s 	 	to	form	in	 it 	 s 	 	 complex 	 ity 	 	that	we	see	right	now	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	look	at	a	tree	,	it	 take 	 s 	 	a	 magn 	 ifying 	 	glass	to	see	a	giant	tree	.
i	have	to	show	you	 some 	 thing 	 	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 ad 	 	at	the	 con 	 clusion 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	talk	.
the	eastern	hemlock	tree	 ha 	 s 	 	often	 be 	 en 	 	 de 	 scribed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 red 	 wood 	 	of	the	east	.
and	we	're	moving	in	a	full	circle	now	.
in	the	1950s	,	a	small	organism	 appear 	 ed 	 	in	richmond	,	virginia	,	 call 	 ed 	 	the	hemlock	 wool 	 ly 	 	adelgid	.
it	made	a	trans	-	species	jump	out	of	some	other	organism	in	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	,	where	it	was	living	on	hemlock	 tree 	 s 	 	in	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	.
when	it	 move 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 it 	 s 	 	new	host	,	the	eastern	hemlock	tree	,	it	 es 	 cap 	 ed 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 predator 	 s 	 	,	and	the	new	tree	had	no	 resist 	 ance 	 	to	it	.
the	eastern	hemlock	forest	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 consider 	 ed 	 	in	some	ways	the	last	 fragment 	 s 	 	of	 prime 	 val 	 	 rain 	 forest 	 	east	of	the	mississippi	river	.
i	had	n't	even	known	that	there	 we 	 re 	 	 rain 	 forest 	 s 	 	in	the	east	,	but	in	great	 smok 	 y 	 	 mountain 	 s 	 	national	park	it	can	rain	up	to	100	 inch 	 es 	 	of	rain	a	year	.
and	in	the	last	two	to	three	 summer 	 s 	 	,	these	invasive	 organism 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 eb 	 ola 	 	of	the	 tree 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 we 	 re 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 wept 	 	through	the	 prime 	 val 	 	hemlock	forest	of	the	east	,	and	 ha 	 s 	 	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 wipe 	 d 	 	it	out	.	i	 climb 	 ed 	 	there	 th 	 is 	 	past	summer	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	great	 smok 	 y 	 	 mountain 	 s 	 	national	park	,	and	the	 hem 	 lock 	 s 	 	are	dead	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	the	eye	can	see	.
and	what	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	is	not	just	the	potential	death	of	the	eastern	hemlock	species	--	that	is	to	say	,	 it 	 s 	 	 extinct 	 ion 	 	from	nature	due	to	 th 	 is 	 	 invad 	 ing 	 	 parasit 	 e 	 	--	but	we	're	 al 	 so 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	the	death	of	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	complex	 eco 	 system 	 	for	which	these	 tree 	 s 	 	are	 mere 	 ly 	 	the	substrate	for	the	 a 	 erial 	 	labyrinth	of	the	sky	that	 exist 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 crown 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 heart 	 break 	 ing 	 	to	see	.
one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	is	just	--	i	 al 	 most 	 	ca	n't	 conceiv 	 e 	 	it	--	is	the	idea	that	the	national	news	media	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 pick 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	up	at	all	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 deva 	 station 	 	of	one	of	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 eco 	 system 	 s 	 	in	north	america	.
what	can	the	 red 	 wood 	 s 	 	tell	us	about	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	?
well	,	i	think	they	can	tell	us	 some 	 thing 	 	about	human	time	.
the	 flick 	 er 	 ing 	 	,	 transit 	 ory 	 	quality	of	human	time	and	the	 b 	 rev 	 ity 	 	of	human	life	--	the	 necess 	 ity 	 	to	love	.
but	we	're	different	from	 tree 	 s 	 	,	and	they	can	 al 	 so 	 	teach	us	 some 	 thing 	 	about	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	the	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	that	we	have	.
we	are	human	,	and	we	have	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	love	,	we	have	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	wonder	,	and	we	have	a	sort	of	 bound 	 less 	 	curiosity	,	a	 rest 	 less 	 	 inquisitive 	 ness 	 	that	so	 suit 	 s 	 	us	 a 	 s 	 	 prim 	 ates 	 	,	i	think	.
and	at	 l 	 east 	 	for	me	,	 personal 	 ly 	 	,	the	 tree 	 s 	 	have	taught	me	an	 entire 	 ly 	 	new	way	of	loving	my	children	.
 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	with	them	the	forest	 can 	 opy 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	one	of	the	most	 love 	 ly 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	of	my	 exist 	 ence 	 	on	earth	.
and	i	think	that	one	of	the	 hap 	 pies 	 t 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	is	the	sense	that	with	my	children	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	 introduc 	 e 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	the	 ver 	 y 	 	small	circle	of	 human 	 s 	 	who	are	 luck 	 y 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	or	possibly	stupid	 en 	 ough 	 	,	to	still	climb	 tree 	 s 	 	.
chris	anderson	:	i	think	at	a	previous	ted	,	i	think	it	was	nathan	myhrvold	who	told	me	that	it	was	thought	that	 be 	 cause 	 	these	 tree 	 s 	 	are	like	,	2,000	 year 	 s 	 	and	 old 	 er 	 	,	on	 man 	 y 	 	of	them	there	are	 eco 	 system 	 s 	 	where	there	are	species	that	are	not	found	 any 	 where 	 	on	the	earth	 ex 	 cept 	 	on	that	one	tree	.	is	that	correct	?
richard	preston	:	 y 	 es 	 	,	that	is	correct	.	i	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	hyperion	,	the	world	's	 tall 	 est 	 	tree	.
and	i	was	a	member	of	a	 climb 	 ing 	 	team	that	made	the	first	climb	of	it	,	in	2006	.
and	while	we	 we 	 re 	 	 climb 	 ing 	 	hyperion	,	marie	antoine	 spot 	 ted 	 	an	 un 	 known 	 	species	of	 gold 	 en 	 	-	 brow 	 n 	 	ant	about	 half 	 way 	 	up	the	trunk	.
ants	are	not	known	to	occur	in	 red 	 wood 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	,	 cur 	 iously 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	and	we	 wonder 	 ed 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	 th 	 is 	 	ant	,	 th 	 is 	 	species	of	ant	,	was	 on 	 ly 	 	 en 	 demic 	 	to	that	one	tree	,	or	possibly	to	that	grove	.
and	in	 sub 	 sequent 	 	 climb 	 s 	 	they	could	never	find	that	ant	 aga 	 in 	 	,	and	so	no	 specimen 	 s 	 	have	ever	 be 	 en 	 	 collect 	 ed 	 	.
we	do	n't	know	what	it	is	--	we	just	know	it	's	there	.
ca	:	so	,	you	have	to	wonder	when	,	you	know	,	if	some	other	species	than	us	was	 record 	 ing 	 	the	 st 	 ories 	 	that	 matter 	 ed 	 	on	earth	,	you	know	,	our	 st 	 ories 	 	are	about	 ir 	 aq 	 	and	war	and	 politic 	 s 	 	and	 celebr 	 ity 	 	gossip	.
you	've	just	told	us	a	different	story	of	 th 	 is 	 	tragic	 arm 	 s 	 	race	that	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	whole	 eco 	 system 	 s 	 	gone	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
it	's	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	sense	of	wonder	you	've	 give 	 n 	 	me	,	and	a	sense	of	just	how	fragile	 th 	 is 	 	whole	thing	is	.
rp	:	it	is	fragile	,	and	you	know	,	i	think	about	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	human	 disease 	 s 	 	--	 parasit 	 es 	 	that	move	 in 	 to 	 	the	human	species	.
but	that	's	just	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	facet	of	a	much	 great 	 er 	 	problem	of	 invasion 	 s 	 	of	species	 world 	 wide 	 	,	all	through	the	 eco 	 system 	 s 	 	,	and	you	know	,	the	earth	 it 	 self 	 	--	ca	:	 part 	 ly 	 	 caus 	 ed 	 	by	us	,	 in 	 advert 	 ent 	 ly 	 	.
rp	:	 caus 	 ed 	 	by	 human 	 s 	 	.	 caus 	 ed 	 	by	the	 move 	 ment 	 	of	 human 	 s 	 	.
you	can	think	of	the	earth	's	 bio 	 sphere 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 pa 	 lace 	 	,	and	the	 continent 	 s 	 	are	rooms	in	the	 pa 	 lace 	 	,	and	the	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	are	small	rooms	.
but	 late 	 ly 	 	,	the	 door 	 s 	 	of	the	 pa 	 lace 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 f 	 lung 	 	open	,	and	the	 wall 	 s 	 	are	coming	down	.
ca	:	richard	preston	,	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	,	i	think	.
rp	:	thank	you	.
