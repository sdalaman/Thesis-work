i	'm	going	to	try	to	give	you	a	view	of	the	world	 a 	 s 	 	i	see	it	,	the	 problem 	 s 	 	and	the	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	that	we	face	,	and	then	ask	the	question	if	we	should	be	 optimist 	 ic 	 	or	 pessim 	 istic 	 	.
and	then	i	'll	let	you	in	on	a	secret	,	which	is	why	i	am	an	 incur 	 able 	 	optimist	.
let	me	start	off	 show 	 ing 	 	you	an	al	gore	movie	that	you	may	have	 s 	 een 	 	before	.
now	,	you	've	all	 s 	 een 	 	``	 in 	 convenient 	 	truth	.	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	little	more	 in 	 convenient 	 	.
:	man	:	...	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	 question 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	with	our	present	knowledge	,	we	have	no	idea	what	would	happen	.
even	now	,	man	may	be	 unwitt 	 ing 	 ly 	 	changing	the	world	's	climate	through	the	waste	 product 	 s 	 	of	his	 civil 	 ization 	 	.

well	,	it	 depend 	 s 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	on	what	your	 goal 	 s 	 	are	.
and	i	think	,	 a 	 s 	 	my	 goal 	 s 	 	,	i	 al 	 ways 	 	go	back	to	gandhi	's	 tal 	 ism 	 an 	 	.
when	mahatma	gandhi	was	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	``	how	do	you	know	if	the	next	act	that	you	are	about	to	do	is	the	right	one	or	the	wrong	one	?	``	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	consider	the	face	of	the	 poor 	 est 	 	,	most	 vulner 	 able 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 	that	you	ever	 chance 	 d 	 	 up 	 on 	 	,	and	ask	 your 	 self 	 	if	the	act	that	you	 contempl 	 ate 	 	will	be	of	benefit	to	that	person	.
and	if	it	will	be	,	it	's	the	right	thing	to	do	,	and	if	not	,	 re 	 think 	 	it	.	``
for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	us	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	it	's	not	just	the	 poor 	 est 	 	and	the	most	 vulner 	 able 	 	individual	,	it	's	the	community	,	it	's	the	culture	,	it	's	the	world	 it 	 self 	 	.
and	the	 trend 	 s 	 	for	 t 	 hose 	 	who	are	at	the	 per 	 iph 	 ery 	 	of	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	who	are	the	 poor 	 est 	 	and	the	most	 vulner 	 able 	 	,	the	 trend 	 s 	 	give	rise	to	a	great	case	for	 pessim 	 ism 	 	.
but	there	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	case	for	 optim 	 ism 	 	.
let	's	review	them	both	.	first	of	all	,	the	 mega 	 trend 	 s 	 	.
there	's	two	 degree 	 s 	 	,	or	three	 degree 	 s 	 	of	climate	change	 bake 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	system	.
it	will	cause	 ris 	 ing 	 	 sea 	 s 	 	.	it	will	cause	 s 	 al 	 ine 	 	 deposit 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 well 	 s 	 	and	 in 	 to 	 	 land 	 s 	 	.
it	will	 dis 	 proportion 	 ate 	 ly 	 	harm	the	 poor 	 est 	 	and	the	most	 vulner 	 able 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	will	the	increasing	rise	of	population	.
even	 th 	 ough 	 	we	've	 dodge 	 d 	 	paul	ehrlich	's	population	bomb	,	and	we	will	not	see	20	billion	people	in	 th 	 is 	 	decade	,	 a 	 s 	 	he	had	 fore 	 cast 	 	,	we	eat	 a 	 s 	 	if	we	 we 	 re 	 	20	billion	.
and	we	 consum 	 e 	 	so	much	that	 aga 	 in 	 	,	a	rise	of	6.5	billion	to	9.5	billion	in	our	 grand 	 children 	 	's	 life 	 time 	 	will	 dis 	 proportion 	 ate 	 ly 	 	hurt	the	 poor 	 est 	 	and	the	most	 vulner 	 able 	 	.
that	's	why	they	 migr 	 ate 	 	to	cities	.
that	's	why	in	june	of	 th 	 is 	 	year	,	we	 pass 	 ed 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	species	,	51	percent	of	us	living	in	cities	,	and	 bust 	 ees 	 	,	and	 s 	 lum 	 s 	 	,	and	 shanty 	 town 	 s 	 	.
the	 r 	 ural 	 	 area 	 s 	 	are	no	 long 	 er 	 	producing	 a 	 s 	 	much	food	 a 	 s 	 	they	did	.
the	green	revolution	never	 reach 	 ed 	 	africa	.
and	with	 desert 	 ification 	 	,	 sand 	 storm 	 s 	 	,	the	gobi	desert	,	the	ogaden	,	we	are	 find 	 ing 	 	increasing	 difficult 	 y 	 	of	a	hectare	to	produce	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 calorie 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	did	even	15	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
so	 human 	 s 	 	are	 turn 	 ing 	 	more	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	animal	consumption	.
in	africa	last	year	,	africans	ate	600	million	wild	 animal 	 s 	 	,	and	 consum 	 ed 	 	two	billion	 kilo 	 gram 	 s 	 	of	bush	meat	.
and	every	 kilo 	 gram 	 	of	bush	meat	 contain 	 ed 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	novel	viruses	that	have	never	 be 	 en 	 	 chart 	 ed 	 	,	the	genomic	 sequence 	 s 	 	of	which	we	do	n't	know	.
 the 	 ir 	 	 fit 	 ness 	 	for	creating	 pan 	 demic 	 s 	 	we	are	 un 	 aware 	 	of	,	but	we	are	 rip 	 e 	 	for	zoonotic	-	borne	,	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	 commun 	 ic 	 able 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	.
 increasing 	 ly 	 	,	i	would	say	explosive	growth	of	technology	.
most	of	us	are	the	 benefici 	 aries 	 	of	that	growth	.	but	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	dark	side	--	in	 bio 	 weapon 	 s 	 	,	and	in	technology	that	 put 	 s 	 	us	on	a	collision	course	to	 magn 	 ify 	 	any	anger	,	hatred	or	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	 marginal 	 ization 	 	.
and	in	fact	,	with	increasing	 global 	 ization 	 	--	for	which	there	are	big	 winner 	 s 	 	and	even	 big 	 ger 	 	 lose 	 rs 	 	--	 to 	 day 	 	the	world	is	more	 divers 	 e 	 	and	 un 	 fair 	 	than	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	 be 	 en 	 	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
one	percent	of	us	own	40	percent	of	all	the	 good 	 s 	 	and	 service 	 s 	 	.
what	will	happen	if	the	billion	people	 to 	 day 	 	who	live	on	less	than	one	dollar	a	day	rise	to	three	billion	in	the	next	30	 year 	 s 	 	?
the	one	percent	will	own	even	more	than	40	percent	of	all	the	world	's	 good 	 s 	 	and	 service 	 s 	 	.	not	 be 	 cause 	 	they	've	grown	 rich 	 er 	 	,	but	 be 	 cause 	 	the	rest	of	the	world	 ha 	 s 	 	grown	 increasing 	 ly 	 	 poor 	 er 	 	.

so	there	's	 lot 	 s 	 	of	reason	for	 pessim 	 ism 	 	.
darfur	is	,	at	 it 	 s 	 	origin	,	a	resource	war	.
last	year	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	85,000	 riot 	 s 	 	in	 chin 	 a 	 	,	230	a	day	,	that	 requir 	 ed 	 	police	or	 militar 	 y 	 	intervention	.
most	of	them	 we 	 re 	 	about	 resource 	 s 	 	.
we	are	facing	an	unprecedented	number	,	scale	of	 disaster 	 s 	 	.
some	are	weather	-	related	,	human	-	 right 	 s 	 	related	,	 epi 	 demic 	 s 	 	.
and	the	 new 	 ly 	 	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	may	make	h	5n1	and	bird	flu	a	 qu 	 ain 	 t 	 	 fore 	 runner 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	to	come	.	it	's	a	 de 	 stabil 	 ized 	 	world	.
and	 un 	 like 	 	 de 	 stabil 	 ized 	 	world	in	the	past	,	it	will	be	 broad 	 cast 	 	to	you	on	youtube	,	you	will	see	it	on	digital	 tele 	 vision 	 	and	on	your	cell	 phone 	 s 	 	.
what	will	that	lead	to	?
for	some	,	it	will	lead	to	anger	,	religious	and	 s 	 ect 	 arian 	 	violence	and	 terror 	 ism 	 	.
for	 other 	 s 	 	,	 withdraw 	 al 	 	,	 nihil 	 ism 	 	,	 material 	 ism 	 	.
for	us	,	where	 do 	 es 	 	it	take	us	,	 a 	 s 	 	social	 activist 	 s 	 	and	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	?
 a 	 s 	 	we	look	at	these	 trend 	 s 	 	,	do	we	 be 	 come 	 	 desponde 	 nt 	 	,	or	will	we	 be 	 come 	 	 energ 	 ized 	 	?
let	's	look	at	one	case	,	the	case	of	bangladesh	.
first	,	even	if	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	 stop 	 ped 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	would	 continu 	 e 	 	.
and	even	with	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	--	if	you	can	see	these	blue	lines	,	the	 dot 	 ted 	 	line	 show 	 s 	 	that	even	if	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	of	 green 	 house 	 	 gas 	 s 	 es 	 	 stop 	 ped 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	the	next	 decade 	 s 	 	will	see	 ris 	 ing 	 	sea	 level 	 s 	 	.
a	 minim 	 um 	 	of	20	to	30	 inch 	 es 	 	of	 in 	 crease 	 	in	sea	 level 	 s 	 	is	the	best	case	that	we	can	hope	for	,	and	it	could	be	10	 time 	 s 	 	that	.
what	will	that	do	to	bangladesh	?	let	's	take	a	look	.
so	here	's	bangladesh	.
70	percent	of	bangladesh	is	at	less	than	five	feet	above	sea	level	.
let	's	go	up	and	take	a	look	at	the	himalayas	.
and	we	'll	watch	 a 	 s 	 	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	 make 	 s 	 	them	melt	.	more	water	 come 	 s 	 	down	,	the	 de 	 forest 	 ed 	 	 area 	 s 	 	,	here	in	the	tarai	,	will	be	 un 	 able 	 	to	absorb	the	 ef 	 fluent 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	are	like	 straw 	 s 	 	that	suck	up	the	extra	 season 	 al 	 	water	.
now	we	're	looking	down	south	,	through	the	kali	gandaki	.
 man 	 y 	 	of	you	,	i	think	,	have	 prob 	 ably 	 	 trek 	 ked 	 	here	.
and	we	're	going	to	 cruis 	 e 	 	down	and	take	a	look	at	bangladesh	and	see	what	the	impact	will	be	of	 t 	 win 	 	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	in	water	coming	from	the	north	,	and	in	the	 sea 	 s 	 	 ris 	 ing 	 	from	the	south	.
looking	at	the	five	major	 river 	 s 	 	that	feed	bangladesh	.
and	now	let	's	look	from	the	south	,	looking	up	,	and	let	's	see	 th 	 is 	 	in	relief	.
a	 minim 	 um 	 	of	20	to	40	 inch 	 es 	 	of	 in 	 crease 	 	in	 sea 	 s 	 	,	 couple 	 d 	 	with	increasing	 flow 	 s 	 	from	the	himalayas	.	and	take	a	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	.	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 a 	 s 	 	100	million	 refuge 	 es 	 	from	bangladesh	could	be	 expect 	 ed 	 	to	 migr 	 ate 	 	 in 	 to 	 	india	and	 in 	 to 	 	 chin 	 a 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 difficult 	 y 	 	that	one	country	 face 	 s 	 	.
but	if	you	look	at	the	 glob 	 e 	 	,	all	around	the	earth	,	 where 	 ver 	 	there	is	low	-	 ly 	 ing 	 	area	,	 populate 	 d 	 	 area 	 s 	 	near	the	water	,	you	will	find	 in 	 crease 	 	in	sea	level	that	will	 challeng 	 e 	 	our	way	of	life	.	sub	-	saharan	africa	,	and	even	our	own	san	francisco	 ba 	 y 	 	area	.
we	're	all	in	 th 	 is 	 	together	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 happen 	 s 	 	far	away	to	people	that	we	do	n't	know	.
global	 warm 	 ing 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 happen 	 s 	 	to	all	of	us	,	all	at	once	.
 a 	 s 	 	are	these	 new 	 ly 	 	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	 commun 	 ic 	 able 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	,	 name 	 s 	 	that	you	had	n't	heard	20	 year 	 s 	 	ago	:	 eb 	 ola 	 	,	lhasa	 f 	 ever 	 	,	monkey	pox	.

do	you	remember	,	20	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	no	one	had	ever	heard	of	west	nile	 f 	 ever 	 	?

it	's	just	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	.

we	may	see	the	 eradic 	 ation 	 	of	 poli 	 o 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	.

20	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	three	and	a	half	million	.

 th 	 is 	 	disease	is	 call 	 ed 	 	sudden	wealth	syndrome	.
it	's	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 phenomen 	 on 	 	.
all	 through 	 out 	 	the	technology	world	,	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	young	people	bitten	by	 th 	 is 	 	disease	of	sudden	wealth	syndrome	.
but	they	're	using	 the 	 ir 	 	wealth	in	a	way	that	 the 	 ir 	 	 fore 	 father 	 s 	 	never	did	.
they	're	not	 wait 	 ing 	 	 un 	 til 	 	they	die	to	create	 found 	 ations 	 	.

 certain 	 ly 	 	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	can	give	you	more	 optim 	 ism 	 	than	that	.
more	 reason 	 s 	 	to	be	 optimist 	 ic 	 	:	in	the	'60s	,	and	i	am	a	creature	of	the	'60s	,	there	was	a	 move 	 ment 	 	.
we	all	felt	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	part	of	it	,	that	a	better	world	was	right	around	the	corner	,	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	the	birth	of	a	world	free	of	hatred	and	violence	and	prejudice	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	kind	of	 move 	 ment 	 	.	it	's	a	 move 	 ment 	 	to	 s 	 ave 	 	the	earth	.

and	on	july	7th	,	around	the	world	,	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 yester 	 day 	 	,	there	will	be	global	live	earth	 concert 	 s 	 	.
and	you	can	feel	 th 	 is 	 	 optimist 	 ic 	 	move	to	 s 	 ave 	 	the	earth	in	the	air	.
now	,	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	that	people	understand	that	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	 hurt 	 s 	 	the	 poor 	 est 	 	and	the	 weak 	 est 	 	the	most	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	people	are	 begin 	 ning 	 	the	first	step	,	which	is	 act 	 ing 	 	out	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	self	-	interest	.
but	i	am	 see 	 ing 	 	in	the	major	 fund 	 ers 	 	,	in	care	,	rockefeller	,	rockefeller	 brother 	 s 	 	fund	,	hewlett	,	 merc 	 y 	 	 corp 	 s 	 	,	you	 guy 	 s 	 	,	google	,	so	 man 	 y 	 	other	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	,	a	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	 understand 	 ing 	 	that	we	need	to	work	not	just	on	 prim 	 ary 	 	 prevent 	 ion 	 	of	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	,	but	on	the	 second 	 ary 	 	 prevent 	 ion 	 	of	the	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	of	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	on	the	 poor 	 est 	 	and	the	most	 vulner 	 able 	 	.
but	for	me	,	i	have	 an 	 other 	 	reason	to	be	an	 incur 	 able 	 	optimist	.
and	you	've	heard	so	 man 	 y 	 	inspiring	 st 	 ories 	 	here	,	and	i	heard	so	 man 	 y 	 	last	night	that	i	thought	i	would	share	a	little	bit	of	mine	.
my	 back 	 ground 	 	is	not	 exact 	 ly 	 	 convention 	 al 	 	medical	training	.
and	i	lived	in	a	himalayan	 mon 	 aste 	 ry 	 	,	and	i	 stud 	 ied 	 	with	a	 ver 	 y 	 	wise	teacher	,	who	 kick 	 ed 	 	me	out	of	the	 mon 	 aste 	 ry 	 	one	day	and	told	me	that	it	was	my	 de 	 s 	 tin 	 y 	 	--	it	felt	like	yoda	--	it	is	your	 de 	 s 	 tin 	 y 	 	to	go	to	work	for	who	and	to	help	 eradic 	 ate 	 	 small 	 pox 	 	,	at	a	time	when	there	was	no	 small 	 pox 	 	program	.
it	should	make	you	 optimist 	 ic 	 	that	 small 	 pox 	 	no	 long 	 er 	 	 exist 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	the	worst	disease	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
in	the	last	century	--	that	's	the	one	that	was	seven	 year 	 s 	 	ago	--	half	a	billion	people	 di 	 ed 	 	from	 small 	 pox 	 	:
more	than	all	the	 war 	 s 	 	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	more	than	any	other	 infect 	 ious 	 	disease	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	the	world	.
in	the	summer	of	love	,	in	1967	,	two	million	people	,	children	,	 di 	 ed 	 	of	 small 	 pox 	 	.
it	's	not	ancient	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
when	you	read	the	biblical	plague	of	 boil 	 s 	 	,	that	was	 small 	 pox 	 	.
pharaoh	ramses	the	fifth	,	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	picture	is	here	,	 di 	 ed 	 	of	 small 	 pox 	 	.
to	 eradic 	 ate 	 	 small 	 pox 	 	,	we	had	to	gather	the	largest	 unit 	 ed 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	 arm 	 y 	 	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
we	 visit 	 ed 	 	every	house	in	india	,	 search 	 ing 	 	for	 small 	 pox 	 	--	120	million	 house 	 s 	 	,	once	every	month	,	for	 near 	 ly 	 	two	 year 	 s 	 	.
in	a	cruel	 revers 	 al 	 	,	after	we	had	 al 	 most 	 	 conquer 	 ed 	 	 small 	 pox 	 	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	you	must	learn	 a 	 s 	 	a	social	entrepreneur	,	the	realm	of	the	final	inch	.
when	we	had	 al 	 most 	 	 eradic 	 ated 	 	 small 	 pox 	 	,	it	came	back	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	company	town	of	tatanagar	drew	 labor 	 ers 	 	,	who	could	come	there	and	get	 employ 	 ment 	 	.
and	they	caught	 small 	 pox 	 	in	the	one	 remain 	 ing 	 	place	that	had	 small 	 pox 	 	,	and	they	went	home	to	die	.	and	when	they	did	,	they	took	 small 	 pox 	 	to	10	other	 count 	 ries 	 	and	 re 	 ignit 	 ed 	 	the	 epi 	 demic 	 	.
and	we	had	to	start	all	over	 aga 	 in 	 	.
but	,	in	the	end	,	we	 succeed 	 ed 	 	,	and	the	last	case	of	 small 	 pox 	 	:	 th 	 is 	 	little	girl	,	rahima	banu	--	barisal	,	in	bangladesh	--	when	she	 cough 	 ed 	 	or	 breath 	 ed 	 	,	and	the	last	virus	of	 small 	 pox 	 	left	her	 lung 	 s 	 	and	fell	on	the	dirt	and	the	 s 	 un 	 	 kill 	 ed 	 	that	last	virus	,	thus	 end 	 ed 	 	a	chain	of	 trans 	 mission 	 	of	 histo 	 ry 	 	's	 great 	 est 	 	 horr 	 or 	 	.
how	can	that	not	make	you	 optimist 	 ic 	 	?
