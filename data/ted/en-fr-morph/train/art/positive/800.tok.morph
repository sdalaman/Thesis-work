so	,	i	was	just	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	go	and	shoot	 th 	 is 	 	film	 call 	 ed 	 	``	elizabeth	.	``
and	we	're	all	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	great	english	icon	and	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	she	's	a	fantastic	woman	,	she	 do 	 es 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	.
how	are	we	going	to	 introduc 	 e 	 	her	?	``
so	we	went	around	the	table	with	the	studio	and	the	 produce 	 rs 	 	and	the	writer	,	and	they	came	to	me	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	shekhar	,	what	do	you	think	?	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	think	she	's	 danc 	 ing 	 	.	``
and	i	could	see	 every 	 body 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	at	me	,	 some 	 body 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	bollywood	.	``
the	other	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	how	much	did	we	hire	him	for	?	``
and	the	third	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	let	's	find	 an 	 other 	 	director	.	``
i	thought	i	had	better	change	.
so	we	had	a	lot	of	 discuss 	 ion 	 	on	how	to	 introduc 	 e 	 	elizabeth	,	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	ok	,	 may 	 be 	 	i	am	too	bollywood	.
 may 	 be 	 	elizabeth	,	 th 	 is 	 	great	icon	,	 danc 	 ing 	 	?
what	are	you	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	?	``
so	i	 re 	 thought 	 	the	whole	thing	,	and	then	we	all	came	to	a	 con 	 sens 	 us 	 	.
and	here	was	the	 introduc 	 tion 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	great	british	icon	 call 	 ed 	 	``	elizabeth	.	``
leicester	:	may	i	join	you	,	my	 lad 	 y 	 	?
elizabeth	:	if	it	 pleas 	 e 	 	you	,	 s 	 ir 	 	.
shekhar	kapur	:	so	she	was	 danc 	 ing 	 	.
so	how	 man 	 y 	 	people	who	saw	the	film	did	not	get	that	here	was	a	woman	in	love	,	that	she	was	 complete 	 ly 	 	 innoc 	 ent 	 	and	saw	great	joy	in	her	life	,	and	she	was	 youth 	 ful 	 	?
and	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	did	not	get	that	?
that	's	the	power	of	visual	 story 	 tell 	 ing 	 	,
that	's	the	power	of	dance	,	that	's	the	power	of	music	:
the	power	of	not	 know 	 ing 	 	.
when	i	go	out	to	direct	a	film	,	every	day	we	 prep 	 are 	 	too	much	,	we	think	too	much	.
knowledge	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	weight	 up 	 on 	 	 wis 	 dom 	 	.
you	know	,	simple	 word 	 s 	 	lost	in	the	 quick 	 sand 	 	of	experience	.
so	i	come	up	,	and	i	say	,	``	what	am	i	going	to	do	 to 	 day 	 	?	``	i	'm	not	going	to	do	what	i	 plan 	 ned 	 	to	do	,	and	i	put	 my 	 self 	 	 in 	 to 	 	absolute	panic	.
it	's	my	one	way	of	 get 	 ting 	 	rid	of	my	mind	,	 get 	 ting 	 	rid	of	 th 	 is 	 	mind	that	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	you	know	what	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	.	you	know	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	.
you	're	a	director	,	you	've	 d 	 one 	 	it	for	 year 	 s 	 	.	``
so	i	've	got	to	get	there	and	be	in	complete	panic	.
it	's	a	 symbol 	 ic 	 	 gest 	 ure 	 	.	i	tear	up	the	script	,
i	go	and	i	panic	 my 	 self 	 	,	i	get	 scar 	 ed 	 	.
i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	it	right	now	;	you	can	watch	me	.	i	'm	 get 	 ting 	 	nervous	,
i	do	n't	know	what	to	say	,	i	do	n't	know	what	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	,	i	do	n't	want	to	go	there	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	i	go	there	,	of	course	,	my	a.d.	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	you	know	what	you	're	going	to	do	,	 s 	 ir 	 	.	``	i	say	,	``	of	course	i	do	.	``
and	the	studio	 ex 	 ecutive 	 s 	 	,	they	would	say	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	look	at	shekhar	.	he	's	so	prepared	.	``
and	 in 	 side 	 	i	've	just	 be 	 en 	 	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	nusrat	fateh	ali	khan	 be 	 cause 	 	he	's	chaotic	.
i	'm	 allow 	 ing 	 	 my 	 self 	 	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	 cha 	 os 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	out	of	 cha 	 os 	 	,	i	'm	 hop 	 ing 	 	some	 moment 	 s 	 	of	truth	will	come	.
all	 pre 	 par 	 ation 	 	is	 pre 	 par 	 ation 	 	.
i	do	n't	even	know	if	it	's	honest	.
i	do	n't	even	know	if	it	's	 truth 	 ful 	 	.
the	truth	of	it	all	 come 	 s 	 	on	the	moment	,	 organ 	 ically 	 	,	and	if	you	get	five	great	 moment 	 s 	 	of	great	,	 organ 	 ic 	 	stuff	in	your	 story 	 tell 	 ing 	 	,	in	your	film	,	your	film	,	 audience 	 s 	 	will	get	it	.
so	i	'm	looking	for	 t 	 hose 	 	 moment 	 s 	 	,	and	i	'm	 stand 	 ing 	 	there	and	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	i	do	n't	know	what	to	say	.	``
so	,	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	 every 	 body 	 	's	looking	at	you	,	200	people	at	seven	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	who	got	there	at	quarter	to	seven	,	and	you	 arriv 	 ed 	 	at	seven	,	and	 every 	 body 	 	's	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	.	what	's	the	first	thing	?	what	's	going	to	happen	?	``
and	you	put	 your 	 self 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	state	of	panic	where	you	do	n't	know	,	and	so	you	do	n't	know	.
and	so	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	do	n't	know	,	you	're	 pray 	 ing 	 	to	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	 pray 	 ing 	 	to	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	that	 some 	 thing 	 	--	i	'm	going	to	try	and	access	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	the	way	einstein	--	say	a	 pray 	 er 	 	--	 access 	 ed 	 	his	 equ 	 ations 	 	,	the	same	source	.	i	'm	looking	for	the	same	source	 be 	 cause 	 	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	 come 	 s 	 	from	 absolute 	 ly 	 	the	same	source	that	you	meditate	 some 	 where 	 	 out 	 side 	 	 your 	 self 	 	,	 out 	 side 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
you	're	looking	for	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 come 	 s 	 	and	 hit 	 s 	 	you	.
 un 	 til 	 	that	 hit 	 s 	 	you	,	you	're	not	going	to	do	the	first	shot	.
so	what	do	you	do	?
so	cate	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	shekhar	,	what	do	you	want	me	to	do	?	``
and	i	say	,	``	cate	,	what	do	you	want	to	do	?	``
``	you	're	a	great	 a 	 ctor 	 	,	and	i	like	to	give	to	my	 act 	 ors 	 	--
why	do	n't	you	show	me	what	you	want	to	do	?	``
what	am	i	 do 	 ing 	 	?	i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	buy	time	.
i	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	buy	time	.
so	the	first	thing	about	 story 	 tell 	 ing 	 	that	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	,	and	i	follow	all	the	time	is	:	panic	.
panic	is	the	great	access	of	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	to	get	rid	of	your	mind	.
get	rid	of	your	mind	.
get	out	of	it	,	get	it	out	.
and	let	's	go	to	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	out	there	that	is	more	 truth 	 ful 	 	than	your	mind	,	that	is	more	 truth 	 ful 	 	than	your	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	,	you	 s 	 aid 	 	that	 yester 	 day 	 	.	i	'm	just	 repeat 	 ing 	 	it	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	what	i	follow	 constant 	 ly 	 	to	find	the	shunyata	 some 	 where 	 	,	the	 empti 	 ness 	 	.
out	of	the	 empti 	 ness 	 	 come 	 s 	 	a	moment	of	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	.
so	that	's	what	i	do	.
when	i	was	a	kid	--	i	was	about	eight	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
you	remember	how	india	was	.	there	was	no	 poll 	 ution 	 	.
in	delhi	,	we	used	to	live	--	we	used	to	call	it	a	 ch 	 hat 	 	or	the	 kh 	 ota 	 	.
 kh 	 ota 	 	's	now	 be 	 come 	 	a	bad	word	.	it	 mean 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 ter 	 race 	 	--	and	we	used	to	sleep	out	at	night	.
at	school	i	was	 be 	 ing 	 	just	taught	about	physics	,	and	i	was	told	that	if	there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 exist 	 s 	 	,	then	it	is	 measur 	 able 	 	.
if	it	is	not	 measur 	 able 	 	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	not	exist	.
and	at	night	i	would	lie	out	,	looking	at	the	 un 	 pollute 	 d 	 	sky	,	 a 	 s 	 	delhi	used	to	be	at	that	time	when	i	was	a	kid	,	and	i	used	to	 star 	 e 	 	at	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	and	say	,	``	how	far	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	go	?	``
my	father	was	a	doctor	.
and	i	would	think	,	``	 d 	 addy 	 	,	how	far	 do 	 es 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	go	?	``
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	son	,	it	 go 	 es 	 	on	 fore 	 ver 	 	.	``
so	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 pleas 	 e 	 	measure	 fore 	 ver 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	in	school	they	're	 teach 	 ing 	 	me	that	if	i	can	not	measure	it	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	not	exist	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	come	 in 	 to 	 	my	frame	of	 re 	 ference 	 	.	``
so	,	how	far	 do 	 es 	 	 et 	 ern 	 ity 	 	go	?
what	 do 	 es 	 	 fore 	 ver 	 	mean	?
and	i	would	lie	there	 cry 	 ing 	 	at	night	 be 	 cause 	 	my	 imagin 	 ation 	 	could	not	touch	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	.
so	what	did	i	do	?
at	that	time	,	at	the	tender	age	of	seven	,	i	 create 	 d 	 	a	story	.
what	was	my	story	?
and	i	do	n't	know	why	,	but	i	remember	the	story	.
there	was	a	 wood 	 cutter 	 	who	's	about	to	take	his	ax	and	chop	a	piece	of	wood	,	and	the	whole	 galax 	 y 	 	is	one	atom	of	that	ax	.
and	when	that	ax	 hit 	 s 	 	that	piece	of	wood	,	that	's	when	 every 	 thing 	 	will	destroy	and	the	big	bang	will	happen	 aga 	 in 	 	.
but	all	before	that	there	was	a	 wood 	 cutter 	 	.
and	then	when	i	would	run	out	of	that	story	,	i	would	imagine	that	 wood 	 cutter 	 	's	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	one	atom	in	the	ax	of	 an 	 other 	 	 wood 	 cutter 	 	.
so	every	time	,	i	could	tell	my	story	 aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	and	get	over	 th 	 is 	 	problem	,	and	so	i	got	over	the	problem	.
how	did	i	do	it	?	tell	a	story	.
so	what	is	a	story	?
a	story	is	our	--	all	of	us	--
we	are	the	 st 	 ories 	 	we	tell	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 exist 	 ence 	 	,	where	we	live	with	 th 	 is 	 	 dual 	 ity 	 	of	 whet 	 her 	 	we	exist	or	not	and	who	are	we	,	the	 st 	 ories 	 	we	tell	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	are	the	 st 	 ories 	 	that	define	the	 potential 	 ities 	 	of	our	 exist 	 ence 	 	.
we	are	the	 st 	 ories 	 	we	tell	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
so	that	's	 a 	 s 	 	wide	 a 	 s 	 	we	look	at	 st 	 ories 	 	.
a	story	is	the	relationship	that	you	develop	between	who	you	are	,	or	who	you	 potential 	 ly 	 	are	,	and	the	infinite	world	,	and	that	's	our	 mytho 	 logy 	 	.
we	tell	our	 st 	 ories 	 	,	and	a	person	 with 	 out 	 	a	story	 do 	 es 	 	not	exist	.
so	einstein	told	a	story	and	 follow 	 ed 	 	his	 st 	 ories 	 	and	came	up	with	 the 	 ories 	 	and	came	up	with	 the 	 ories 	 	and	then	came	up	with	his	 equ 	 ations 	 	.
alexander	had	a	story	that	his	mother	used	to	tell	him	,	and	he	went	out	to	conquer	the	world	.
we	all	,	 every 	 body 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	a	story	that	they	follow	.
we	tell	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	.
so	,	i	will	go	further	,	and	i	say	,	``	i	tell	a	story	,	and	 there 	 fore 	 	i	exist	.	``
i	exist	 be 	 cause 	 	there	are	 st 	 ories 	 	,	and	if	there	are	no	 st 	 ories 	 	,	we	do	n't	exist	.
we	create	 st 	 ories 	 	to	define	our	 exist 	 ence 	 	.
if	we	do	not	create	the	 st 	 ories 	 	,	we	 prob 	 ably 	 	go	mad	.
i	do	n't	know	;	i	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	,	but	that	's	what	i	've	 d 	 one 	 	all	the	time	.
now	,	a	film	.
a	film	 tell 	 s 	 	a	story	.
i	often	wonder	when	i	make	a	film	--	i	'm	 think 	 ing 	 	of	making	a	film	of	the	buddha	--	and	i	often	wonder	:	if	buddha	had	all	the	 element 	 s 	 	that	are	 give 	 n 	 	to	a	director	--	if	he	had	music	,	if	he	had	 visual 	 s 	 	,	if	he	had	a	video	camera	--	would	we	get	buddhism	better	?
but	that	 put 	 s 	 	some	kind	of	burden	on	me	.
i	have	to	tell	a	story	in	a	much	more	elaborate	way	,	but	i	have	the	potential	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	 sub 	 text 	 	.
when	i	first	went	to	hollywood	,	they	 s 	 aid 	 	--	i	used	to	talk	about	 sub 	 text 	 	,	and	my	agent	came	to	me	,	``	would	you	 kind 	 ly 	 	not	talk	about	 sub 	 text 	 	?	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	why	?	``	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 be 	 cause 	 	 no 	 body 	 	is	going	to	give	you	a	film	if	you	talk	about	 sub 	 text 	 	.
just	talk	about	plot	and	say	how	 wonder 	 ful 	 	you	'll	shoot	the	film	,	what	the	 visual 	 s 	 	will	be	.	``
so	when	i	look	at	a	film	,	here	's	what	we	look	for	:	we	look	for	a	story	on	the	plot	level	,	on	the	 psycho 	 logical 	 	level	,	then	we	look	for	a	story	on	the	 politic 	 al 	 	level	,	then	we	look	at	a	story	on	a	 mytho 	 logical 	 	level	.
and	i	look	for	 st 	 ories 	 	on	each	level	.
now	,	it	is	not	 necess 	 ary 	 	that	these	 st 	 ories 	 	agree	with	each	other	.
what	is	 wonder 	 ful 	 	is	,	at	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	,	the	 st 	 ories 	 	will	contradict	with	each	other	.
so	when	i	work	with	rahman	who	's	a	great	 music 	 ian 	 	,	i	often	tell	him	,	``	do	n't	follow	what	the	script	 al 	 ready 	 	 say 	 s 	 	.
find	that	which	is	not	.
find	the	truth	for	 your 	 self 	 	,	and	when	you	find	the	truth	for	 your 	 self 	 	,	there	will	be	a	truth	in	it	,	but	it	may	contradict	the	plot	,	but	do	n't	worry	about	it	.	``
so	,	the	 s 	 equ 	 el 	 	to	``	elizabeth	,	``	``	 gold 	 en 	 	age	.	``
when	i	made	the	 s 	 equ 	 el 	 	to	``	elizabeth	,	``	here	was	a	story	that	the	writer	was	 tell 	 ing 	 	:
a	woman	who	was	 threaten 	 ed 	 	by	philip	ii	and	was	going	to	war	,	and	was	going	to	war	,	fell	in	love	with	walter	raleigh	.
 be 	 cause 	 	she	fell	in	love	with	walter	raleigh	,	she	was	giving	up	the	 reason 	 s 	 	she	was	a	 que 	 en 	 	,
and	then	walter	raleigh	fell	in	love	with	her	 lad 	 y 	 	in	 wait 	 ing 	 	,	and	she	had	to	decide	 whet 	 her 	 	she	was	a	 que 	 en 	 	going	to	war	or	she	 want 	 ed 	 	...
here	's	the	story	i	was	 tell 	 ing 	 	:
the	 god 	 s 	 	up	there	,
there	 we 	 re 	 	two	people	.
there	was	philip	ii	,	who	was	divine	 be 	 cause 	 	he	was	 al 	 ways 	 	 pray 	 ing 	 	,	and	there	was	elizabeth	,	who	was	divine	,	but	not	 quit 	 e 	 	divine	 be 	 cause 	 	she	thought	she	was	divine	,	but	the	blood	of	 be 	 ing 	 	mortal	 flow 	 ed 	 	in	her	.
but	the	divine	one	was	 un 	 just 	 	,	so	the	 god 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	ok	,	what	we	need	to	do	is	help	the	just	one	.	``
and	so	they	 help 	 ed 	 	the	just	one	.
and	what	they	did	was	,	they	 s 	 ent 	 	walter	raleigh	down	to	 physical 	 ly 	 	 separat 	 e 	 	her	mortal	self	from	her	spirit	self	.
and	the	mortal	self	was	the	girl	that	walter	raleigh	was	 s 	 ent 	 	,	and	 gradu 	 ally 	 	he	 separat 	 ed 	 	her	so	she	was	free	to	be	divine	.
and	the	two	divine	people	 f 	 ought 	 	,	and	the	 god 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	on	the	side	of	 div 	 in 	 ity 	 	.
of	course	,	all	the	british	press	got	 re 	 ally 	 	 up 	 set 	 	.
they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	won	the	armada	.	``
but	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	but	the	storm	won	the	armada	.
the	 god 	 s 	 	 s 	 ent 	 	the	storm	.	``
so	what	was	i	 do 	 ing 	 	?
i	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	find	a	 myth 	 ic 	 	reason	to	make	the	film	.
of	course	,	when	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	cate	blanchett	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	what	's	the	film	about	?	``
she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	the	film	's	about	a	woman	coming	to	 term 	 s 	 	with	growing	 old 	 er 	 	.	``
 psycho 	 logical 	 	.
the	writer	 s 	 aid 	 	``	it	's	about	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	plot	.	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	``	it	's	about	 mytho 	 logy 	 	,	the	 god 	 s 	 	.	``
so	let	me	show	you	a	film	--	a	piece	from	that	film	--	and	how	a	camera	 al 	 so 	 	--	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	scene	,	where	in	my	mind	,	she	was	at	the	 depth 	 s 	 	of	 mortal 	 ity 	 	.
she	was	 discover 	 ing 	 	what	 mortal 	 ity 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	,	and	if	she	is	at	the	 depth 	 s 	 	of	 mortal 	 ity 	 	,	what	 re 	 ally 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	.
and	she	's	 recogn 	 izing 	 	the	 danger 	 s 	 	of	 mortal 	 ity 	 	and	why	she	should	break	away	from	 mortal 	 ity 	 	.
remember	,	in	the	film	,	to	me	,	both	her	and	her	 lad 	 y 	 	in	 wait 	 ing 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	same	body	,	one	the	mortal	self	and	one	the	spirit	self	.
so	can	we	have	that	second	?

bess	:	 a 	 s 	 	you	wish	,	 majes 	 ty 	 	.
elizabeth	:	get	out	!	get	out	!	get	out	!
get	out	.
shekhar	kapur	:	so	,	what	am	i	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	here	?
elizabeth	 ha 	 s 	 	 real 	 ized 	 	,	and	she	's	coming	face	-	to	-	face	with	her	own	sense	of	 jealous 	 y 	 	,	her	own	sense	of	 mortal 	 ity 	 	.
what	am	i	 do 	 ing 	 	with	the	 architect 	 ure 	 	?
the	 architect 	 ure 	 	is	 tell 	 ing 	 	a	story	.
the	 architect 	 ure 	 	is	 tell 	 ing 	 	a	story	about	how	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	she	's	the	most	 power 	 ful 	 	woman	in	the	world	at	that	time	,	there	is	the	other	,	the	 architect 	 ure 	 	's	 big 	 ger 	 	.
the	stone	is	 big 	 ger 	 	than	her	 be 	 cause 	 	stone	is	an	 organ 	 ic 	 	.
it	'll	 surviv 	 e 	 	her	.
so	it	's	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	,	to	me	,	stone	is	part	of	her	 de 	 s 	 tin 	 y 	 	.
not	 on 	 ly 	 	that	,	why	is	the	camera	looking	down	?
the	camera	's	looking	down	at	her	 be 	 cause 	 	she	's	in	the	well	.
she	's	in	the	absolute	well	of	her	own	sense	of	 be 	 ing 	 	mortal	.
that	's	where	she	 ha 	 s 	 	to	pull	 her 	 self 	 	out	from	the	 depth 	 s 	 	of	 mortal 	 ity 	 	,	come	in	,	 re 	 lease 	 	her	spirit	.
and	that	's	the	moment	where	,	in	my	mind	,	both	elizabeth	and	bess	are	the	same	person	.
but	that	's	the	moment	she	's	 sur 	 gical 	 ly 	 	 re 	 moving 	 	 her 	 self 	 	from	that	.
so	the	film	is	 oper 	 ating 	 	on	 man 	 y 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 level 	 s 	 	in	that	scene	.
and	how	we	tell	 st 	 ories 	 	 visual 	 ly 	 	,	with	music	,	with	 act 	 ors 	 	,	and	at	each	level	it	's	a	different	sense	and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 contradict 	 ory 	 	to	each	other	.
so	how	do	i	start	all	 th 	 is 	 	?
what	's	the	process	of	 tell 	 ing 	 	a	story	?
about	ten	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	heard	 th 	 is 	 	little	thing	from	a	 politic 	 ian 	 	,	not	a	 politic 	 ian 	 	that	was	 ver 	 y 	 	well	 respect 	 ed 	 	in	india	.
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	that	these	people	in	the	cities	,	in	one	flush	,	expend	 a 	 s 	 	much	water	 a 	 s 	 	you	people	in	the	 r 	 ural 	 	 area 	 s 	 	do	n't	get	for	your	family	for	two	 day 	 s 	 	.
that	 s 	 truck 	 	a	 chor 	 d 	 	,	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	that	's	true	.	``
i	went	to	see	a	friend	of	mine	,	and	he	made	me	wait	in	his	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	in	malabar	hill	on	the	 t 	 went 	 ieth 	 	floor	,	which	is	a	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 up 	 market 	 	area	in	mumbai	.
and	he	was	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	shower	for	20	 minute 	 s 	 	.
i	got	 bor 	 ed 	 	and	left	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	i	drove	out	,	i	drove	past	the	 s 	 lum 	 s 	 	of	bombay	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	 al 	 ways 	 	do	,	and	i	saw	lines	and	lines	in	the	hot	 mid 	 day 	 	 s 	 un 	 	of	women	and	children	with	 buck 	 et 	 s 	 	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	a	 tank 	 er 	 	to	come	and	give	them	water	.
and	an	idea	 start 	 ed 	 	to	develop	.
so	how	 do 	 es 	 	that	 be 	 come 	 	a	story	?
i	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 real 	 ized 	 	that	we	are	 head 	 ing 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	disaster	.
so	my	next	film	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	paani	``	which	 mean 	 s 	 	water	.
and	now	,	out	of	the	 mytho 	 logy 	 	of	that	,	i	'm	 start 	 ing 	 	to	create	a	world	.
what	kind	of	world	do	i	create	,	and	where	 do 	 es 	 	the	idea	,	the	design	of	that	come	?
so	,	in	my	mind	,	in	the	future	,	they	 start 	 ed 	 	to	build	 fly 	 over 	 s 	 	.
you	understand	 fly 	 over 	 s 	 	?	 yea 	 h 	 	?
they	 start 	 ed 	 	to	build	 fly 	 over 	 s 	 	to	get	from	a	to	b	 fast 	 er 	 	,	but	they	 effective 	 ly 	 	went	from	one	area	of	 relat 	 ive 	 	wealth	to	 an 	 other 	 	area	of	 relat 	 ive 	 	wealth	.
and	then	what	they	did	was	they	 create 	 d 	 	a	city	above	the	 fly 	 over 	 s 	 	.
and	the	rich	people	 move 	 d 	 	to	the	upper	city	and	left	the	 poor 	 er 	 	people	in	the	lower	cities	,	about	10	to	12	percent	of	the	people	have	 move 	 d 	 	to	the	upper	city	.
now	,	where	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	upper	city	and	lower	city	come	?
there	's	a	 mytho 	 logy 	 	in	india	about	--	where	they	say	,	and	i	'll	say	it	in	hindi	,	[	hindi	]	right	.	what	 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	?
it	 say 	 s 	 	that	the	rich	are	 al 	 ways 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	on	the	 shoulder 	 s 	 	and	 surviv 	 e 	 	on	the	 shoulder 	 s 	 	of	the	poor	.
so	,	from	that	 mytho 	 logy 	 	,	the	upper	city	and	lower	city	come	.
so	the	design	 ha 	 s 	 	a	story	.
and	now	,	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	that	the	people	of	the	upper	city	,	they	suck	up	all	the	water	.
remember	the	word	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	suck	up	.
they	suck	up	all	the	water	,	keep	to	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	and	they	drip	feed	the	lower	city	.
and	if	there	's	any	revolution	,	they	cut	off	the	water	.
and	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 demo 	 cracy 	 	still	 exist 	 s 	 	,	there	's	a	 democrat 	 ic 	 	way	in	which	you	say	``	well	,	if	you	give	us	what	[	we	want	]	,	we	'll	give	you	water	.	``
so	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	my	time	is	up	.
but	i	can	go	on	about	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	how	we	evolve	 st 	 ories 	 	,	and	how	 st 	 ories 	 	 effective 	 ly 	 	are	who	we	are	and	how	these	get	 transl 	 ated 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 part 	 icular 	 	discipline	that	i	am	in	,	which	is	film	.
but	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	what	is	a	story	?	it	's	a	 contradict 	 ion 	 	.
 every 	 thing 	 	's	a	 contradict 	 ion 	 	.
the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	a	 contradict 	 ion 	 	.
and	all	of	us	are	 constant 	 ly 	 	looking	for	 harmon 	 y 	 	.
when	you	get	up	,	the	night	and	day	is	a	 contradict 	 ion 	 	.
but	you	get	up	at	4	a.m	.
that	first	blush	of	blue	is	where	the	night	and	day	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	find	 harmon 	 y 	 	with	each	other	.
 harmon 	 y 	 	is	the	 note 	 s 	 	that	mozart	did	n't	give	you	,	but	 some 	 how 	 	the	 contradict 	 ion 	 	of	his	 note 	 s 	 	suggest	that	.
all	 contradict 	 ions 	 	of	his	 note 	 s 	 	suggest	the	 harmon 	 y 	 	.
it	's	the	effect	of	looking	for	 harmon 	 y 	 	in	the	 contradict 	 ion 	 	that	 exist 	 s 	 	in	a	poet	's	mind	,	a	 contradict 	 ion 	 	that	 exist 	 s 	 	in	a	 story 	 teller 	 	's	mind	.
in	a	 story 	 teller 	 	's	mind	,	it	's	a	 contradict 	 ion 	 	of	 moral 	 ities 	 	.
in	a	poet	's	mind	,	it	's	a	conflict	of	 word 	 s 	 	,
in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	's	mind	,	between	day	and	night	.
in	the	mind	of	a	man	and	a	woman	,	we	're	looking	 constant 	 ly 	 	at	the	 contradict 	 ion 	 	between	male	and	female	,
we	're	looking	for	 harmon 	 y 	 	 with 	 in 	 	each	other	.
the	whole	idea	of	 contradict 	 ion 	 	,	but	the	 accept 	 ance 	 	of	 contradict 	 ion 	 	is	the	 tell 	 ing 	 	of	a	story	,	not	the	 re 	 solution 	 	.
the	problem	with	a	lot	of	the	 story 	 tell 	 ing 	 	in	hollywood	and	 man 	 y 	 	 film 	 s 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	was	 say 	 ing 	 	in	his	,	that	we	try	to	 re 	 solve 	 	the	 contradict 	 ion 	 	.
 harmon 	 y 	 	is	not	 re 	 solution 	 	.
 harmon 	 y 	 	is	the	 suggest 	 ion 	 	of	a	thing	that	is	much	 large 	 r 	 	than	 re 	 solution 	 	.
 harmon 	 y 	 	is	the	 suggest 	 ion 	 	of	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	 em 	 bracing 	 	and	universal	and	of	 et 	 ern 	 ity 	 	and	of	the	moment	.
 re 	 solution 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	far	more	 limit 	 ed 	 	.
it	is	 fin 	 ite 	 	;	 harmon 	 y 	 	is	infinite	.
so	that	 story 	 tell 	 ing 	 	,	like	all	other	 contradict 	 ions 	 	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	is	looking	for	 harmon 	 y 	 	and	 in 	 fin 	 ity 	 	in	moral	 re 	 solution 	 s 	 	,	 re 	 solving 	 	one	,	but	 lett 	 ing 	 	 an 	 other 	 	go	,	 lett 	 ing 	 	 an 	 other 	 	go	and	creating	a	question	that	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
