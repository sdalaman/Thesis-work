when	i	was	14	years	old	,	i	had	low	self	-	esteem	.
i	felt	i	was	not	talented	at	anything	.
one	day	,	i	bought	a	yo	-	yo	.
when	i	tried	my	first	trick	,	it	looked	like	this	.
i	could	n't	even	do	the	simplest	trick	,	but	it	was	very	natural	for	me	,	because	i	was	not	dextrous	,	and	hated	all	sports	.
but	after	one	week	of	practicing	,	my	throws	became	more	like	this	.
a	bit	better	.
i	thought	,	the	yo	-	yo	is	something	for	me	to	be	good	at	,	for	the	first	time	in	my	life	.
i	found	my	passion	.
i	was	spending	all	my	time	practicing	.
it	took	me	hours	and	hours	a	day	to	build	my	skills	up	to	the	next	level	.
and	then	,	four	years	later	,	when	i	was	18	years	old	,	i	was	standing	onstage	at	the	world	yo	-	yo	contest	.
and	i	won	.
i	was	so	excited	.	``	yes	,	i	did	it	!	i	became	a	hero	.
i	may	get	many	sponsors	,	a	lot	of	money	,	tons	of	interviews	,	and	be	on	tv	!	``	i	thought	.
but	after	coming	back	to	japan	,	totally	nothing	changed	in	my	life	.
i	realized	society	did	n't	value	my	passion	.
so	i	went	back	to	my	college	and	became	a	typical	japanese	worker	as	a	systems	engineer	.
i	felt	my	passion	,	heart	and	soul	,	had	left	my	body	.
i	felt	i	was	not	alive	anymore	.
so	i	started	to	consider	what	i	should	do	,	and	i	thought	,	i	wanted	to	make	my	performance	better	,	and	to	show	onstage	how	spectacular	the	yo	-	yo	could	be	to	change	the	public	's	image	of	the	yo	-	yo	.
so	i	quit	my	company	and	started	a	career	as	a	professional	performer	.
i	started	to	learn	classic	ballet	,	jazz	dance	,	acrobatics	and	other	things	to	make	my	performance	better	.
as	a	result	of	these	efforts	,	and	the	help	of	many	others	,	it	happened	.
i	won	the	world	yo	-	yo	contest	again	in	the	artistic	performance	division	.
i	passed	an	audition	for	cirque	du	soleil	.
today	,	i	am	standing	on	the	ted	stage	with	the	yo	-	yo	in	front	of	you	.
what	i	learned	from	the	yo	-	yo	is	,	if	i	make	enough	effort	with	huge	passion	,	there	is	no	impossible	.
could	you	let	me	share	my	passion	with	you	through	my	performance	?
