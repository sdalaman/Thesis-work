that	's	how	we	traveled	in	the	year	1900	.
that	's	an	open	buggy	.	it	does	n't	have	heating	.
it	does	n't	have	air	conditioning	.
that	horse	is	pulling	it	along	at	one	percent	of	the	speed	of	sound	,	and	the	rutted	dirt	road	turns	into	a	quagmire	of	mud	anytime	it	rains	.
that	's	a	boeing	707	.
only	60	years	later	,	it	travels	at	80	percent	of	the	speed	of	sound	,	and	we	do	n't	travel	any	faster	today	because	commercial	supersonic	air	travel	turned	out	to	be	a	bust	.
so	i	started	wondering	and	pondering	,	could	it	be	that	the	best	years	of	american	economic	growth	are	behind	us	?
and	that	leads	to	the	suggestion	,	maybe	economic	growth	is	almost	over	.
some	of	the	reasons	for	this	are	not	really	very	controversial	.
there	are	four	headwinds	that	are	just	hitting	the	american	economy	in	the	face	.
they	're	demographics	,	education	,	debt	and	inequality	.
they	're	powerful	enough	to	cut	growth	in	half	.
so	we	need	a	lot	of	innovation	to	offset	this	decline	.
and	here	's	my	theme	:	because	of	the	headwinds	,	if	innovation	continues	to	be	as	powerful	as	it	has	been	in	the	last	150	years	,	growth	is	cut	in	half	.
if	innovation	is	less	powerful	,	invents	less	great	,	wonderful	things	,	then	growth	is	going	to	be	even	lower	than	half	of	history	.
now	here	's	eight	centuries	of	economic	growth	.
the	vertical	axis	is	just	percent	per	year	of	growth	,	zero	percent	a	year	,	one	percent	a	year	,	two	percent	a	year	.
the	white	line	is	for	the	u.k.	,	and	then	the	u.s	.
takes	over	as	the	leading	nation	in	the	year	1900	,	when	the	line	switches	to	red	.
you	'll	notice	that	,	for	the	first	four	centuries	,	there	's	hardly	any	growth	at	all	,	just	0.2	percent	.
then	growth	gets	better	and	better	.
it	maxes	out	in	the	1930s	,	'40s	and	'50s	,	and	then	it	starts	slowing	down	,	and	here	's	a	cautionary	note	.
that	last	downward	notch	in	the	red	line	is	not	actual	data	.
that	is	a	forecast	that	i	made	six	years	ago	that	growth	would	slow	down	to	1.3	percent	.
but	you	know	what	the	actual	facts	are	?
you	know	what	the	growth	in	per	-	person	income	has	been	in	the	united	states	in	the	last	six	years	?
negative	.
this	led	to	a	fantasy	.
what	if	i	try	to	fit	a	curved	line	to	this	historical	record	?
i	can	make	the	curved	line	end	anywhere	i	wanted	,	but	i	decided	i	would	end	it	at	0.2	,	just	like	the	u.k.	growth	for	the	first	four	centuries	.
now	the	history	that	we	've	achieved	is	that	we	've	grown	at	2.0	percent	per	year	over	the	whole	period	,	1891	to	2007	,	and	remember	it	's	been	a	little	bit	negative	since	2007	.
but	if	growth	slows	down	,	instead	of	doubling	our	standard	of	living	every	generation	,	americans	in	the	future	ca	n't	expect	to	be	twice	as	well	off	as	their	parents	,	or	even	a	quarter	[	more	well	off	than	]	their	parents	.
now	we	're	going	to	change	and	look	at	the	level	of	per	capita	income	.
the	vertical	axis	now	is	thousands	of	dollars	in	today	's	prices	.
you	'll	notice	that	in	1891	,	over	on	the	left	,	we	were	at	about	5,000	dollars	.
today	we	're	at	about	44,000	dollars	of	total	output	per	member	of	the	population	.
now	what	if	we	could	achieve	that	historic	two	-	percent	growth	for	the	next	70	years	?
well	,	it	's	a	matter	of	arithmetic	.
two	-	percent	growth	quadruples	your	standard	of	living	in	70	years	.
that	means	we	'd	go	from	44,000	to	180,000	.
well	,	we	're	not	going	to	do	that	,	and	the	reason	is	the	headwinds	.
the	first	headwind	is	demographics	.
it	's	a	truism	that	your	standard	of	living	rises	faster	than	productivity	,	rises	faster	than	output	per	hour	,	if	hours	per	person	increased	.
and	we	got	that	gift	back	in	the	'70s	and	'80s	when	women	entered	the	labor	force	.
but	now	it	's	turned	around	.
now	hours	per	person	are	shrinking	,	and	second	because	there	's	been	a	very	significant	dropping	out	of	the	labor	force	of	prime	age	adult	males	who	are	in	the	bottom	half	of	the	educational	distribution	.
the	next	headwind	is	education	.
we	've	got	problems	all	over	our	educational	system	in	college	,	we	've	got	cost	inflation	in	higher	education	that	dwarfs	cost	inflation	in	medical	care	.
we	have	in	higher	education	a	trillion	dollars	of	student	debt	,	and	our	college	completion	rate	is	15	points	,	15	percentage	points	below	canada	.
we	have	a	lot	of	debt	.
our	economy	grew	from	2000	to	2007	on	the	back	of	consumers	massively	overborrowing	.
consumers	paying	off	that	debt	is	one	of	the	main	reasons	why	our	economic	recovery	is	so	sluggish	today	.
and	everybody	of	course	knows	that	the	federal	government	debt	is	growing	as	a	share	of	gdp	at	a	very	rapid	rate	,	and	the	only	way	that	's	going	to	stop	is	some	combination	of	faster	growth	in	taxes	or	slower	growth	in	entitlements	,	also	called	transfer	payments	.
and	that	gets	us	down	from	the	1.5	,	where	we	've	reached	for	education	,	down	to	1.3	.
and	then	we	have	inequality	.
over	the	15	years	before	the	financial	crisis	,	the	growth	rate	of	the	bottom	99	percent	of	the	income	distribution	was	half	a	point	slower	than	the	averages	we	've	been	talking	about	before	.
all	the	rest	went	to	the	top	one	percent	.
so	that	brings	us	down	to	0.8	.
and	that	0.8	is	the	big	challenge	.
are	we	going	to	grow	at	0.8	?
if	so	,	that	's	going	to	require	that	our	inventions	are	as	important	as	the	ones	that	happened	over	the	last	150	years	.
so	let	's	see	what	some	of	those	inventions	were	.
if	you	wanted	to	read	in	1875	at	night	,	you	needed	to	have	an	oil	or	a	gas	lamp	.
they	created	pollution	,	they	created	odors	,	they	were	hard	to	control	,	the	light	was	dim	,	and	they	were	a	fire	hazard	.
by	1929	,	electric	light	was	everywhere	.
we	had	the	vertical	city	,	the	invention	of	the	elevator	.
central	manhattan	became	possible	.
and	then	,	in	addition	to	that	,	at	the	same	time	,	hand	tools	were	replaced	by	massive	electric	tools	and	hand	-	powered	electric	tools	,	all	achieved	by	electricity	.
electricity	was	also	very	helpful	in	liberating	women	.
women	,	back	in	the	late	19th	century	,	spent	two	days	a	week	doing	the	laundry	.
they	did	it	on	a	scrub	board	.
then	they	had	to	hang	the	clothes	out	to	dry	.
then	they	had	to	bring	them	in	.
the	whole	thing	took	two	days	out	of	the	seven	-	day	week	.
and	then	we	had	the	electric	washing	machine	.
and	by	1950	,	they	were	everywhere	.
but	the	women	still	had	to	shop	every	day	,	but	no	they	did	n't	,	because	electricity	brought	us	the	electric	refrigerator	.
back	in	the	late	19th	century	,	the	only	source	of	heat	in	most	homes	was	a	big	fireplace	in	the	kitchen	that	was	used	for	cooking	and	heating	.
the	bedrooms	were	cold	.	they	were	unheated	.
but	by	1929	,	certainly	by	1950	,	we	had	central	heating	everywhere	.
what	about	the	internal	combustion	engine	,	which	was	invented	in	1879	?
in	america	,	before	the	motor	vehicle	,	transportation	depended	entirely	on	the	urban	horse	,	which	dropped	,	without	restraint	,	25	to	50	pounds	of	manure	on	the	streets	every	day	together	with	a	gallon	of	urine	.
that	comes	out	at	five	to	10	tons	daily	per	square	mile	in	cities	.
those	horses	also	ate	up	fully	one	quarter	of	american	agricultural	land	.
that	's	the	percentage	of	american	agricultural	land	it	took	to	feed	the	horses	.
of	course	,	when	the	motor	vehicle	was	invented	,	and	it	became	almost	ubiquitous	by	1929	,	that	agricultural	land	could	be	used	for	human	consumption	or	for	export	.
and	here	's	an	interesting	ratio	:	starting	from	zero	in	1900	,	only	30	years	later	,	the	ratio	of	motor	vehicles	to	the	number	of	households	in	the	united	states	reached	90	percent	in	just	30	years	.
back	before	the	turn	of	the	century	,	women	had	another	problem	.
all	the	water	for	cooking	,	cleaning	and	bathing	had	to	be	carried	in	buckets	and	pails	in	from	the	outside	.
it	's	a	historical	fact	that	in	1885	,	the	average	north	carolina	housewife	walked	148	miles	a	year	carrying	35	tons	of	water	.
but	by	1929	,	cities	around	the	country	had	put	in	underground	water	pipes	.
they	had	put	in	underground	sewer	pipes	,	and	as	a	result	,	one	of	the	great	scourges	of	the	late	19th	century	,	waterborne	diseases	like	cholera	,	began	to	disappear	.
and	an	amazing	fact	for	techno	-	optimists	is	that	in	the	first	half	of	the	20th	century	,	the	rate	of	improvement	of	life	expectancy	was	three	times	faster	than	it	was	in	the	second	half	of	the	19th	century	.
so	it	's	a	truism	that	things	ca	n't	be	more	than	100	percent	of	themselves	.
and	i	'll	just	give	you	a	few	examples	.
we	went	from	one	percent	to	90	percent	of	the	speed	of	sound	.
electrification	,	central	heat	,	ownership	of	motor	cars	,	they	all	went	from	zero	to	100	percent	.
urban	environments	make	people	more	productive	than	on	the	farm	.
we	went	from	25	percent	urban	to	75	percent	by	the	early	postwar	years	.
what	about	the	electronic	revolution	?
here	's	an	early	computer	.
it	's	amazing	.	the	mainframe	computer	was	invented	in	1942	.
by	1960	we	had	telephone	bills	,	bank	statements	were	being	produced	by	computers	.
the	earliest	cell	phones	,	the	earliest	personal	computers	were	invented	in	the	1970s	.
the	1980s	brought	us	bill	gates	,	dos	,	atm	machines	to	replace	bank	tellers	,	bar	code	scanning	to	cut	down	on	labor	in	the	retail	sector	.
fast	forward	through	the	'90s	,	we	had	the	dotcom	revolution	and	a	temporary	rise	in	productivity	growth	.
but	i	'm	now	going	to	give	you	an	experiment	.
you	have	to	choose	either	option	a	or	option	b	.
option	a	is	you	get	to	keep	everything	invented	up	till	10	years	ago	.
so	you	get	google	,	you	get	amazon	,	you	get	wikipedia	,	and	you	get	running	water	and	indoor	toilets	.
or	you	get	everything	invented	to	yesterday	,	including	facebook	and	your	iphone	,	but	you	have	to	give	up	,	go	out	to	the	outhouse	,	and	carry	in	the	water	.
hurricane	sandy	caused	a	lot	of	people	to	lose	the	20th	century	,	maybe	for	a	couple	of	days	,	in	some	cases	for	more	than	a	week	,	electricity	,	running	water	,	heating	,	gasoline	for	their	cars	,	and	a	charge	for	their	iphones	.
the	problem	we	face	is	that	all	these	great	inventions	,	we	have	to	match	them	in	the	future	,	and	my	prediction	that	we	're	not	going	to	match	them	brings	us	down	from	the	original	two	-	percent	growth	down	to	0.2	,	the	fanciful	curve	that	i	drew	you	at	the	beginning	.
so	here	we	are	back	to	the	horse	and	buggy	.
i	'd	like	to	award	an	oscar	to	the	inventors	of	the	20th	century	,	the	people	from	alexander	graham	bell	to	thomas	edison	to	the	wright	brothers	,	i	'd	like	to	call	them	all	up	here	,	and	they	're	going	to	call	back	to	you	.
your	challenge	is	,	can	you	match	what	we	achieved	?
thank	you	.
