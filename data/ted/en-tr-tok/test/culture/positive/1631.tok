i	essentially	drag	sledges	for	a	living	,	so	it	does	n't	take	an	awful	lot	to	flummox	me	intellectually	,	but	i	'm	going	to	read	this	question	from	an	interview	earlier	this	year	:	``	philosophically	,	does	the	constant	supply	of	information	steal	our	ability	to	imagine	or	replace	our	dreams	of	achieving	?
after	all	,	if	it	is	being	done	somewhere	by	someone	,	and	we	can	participate	virtually	,	then	why	bother	leaving	the	house	?	``
i	'm	usually	introduced	as	a	polar	explorer	.
i	'm	not	sure	that	's	the	most	progressive	or	21st	-	century	of	job	titles	,	but	i	've	spent	more	than	two	percent	now	of	my	entire	life	living	in	a	tent	inside	the	arctic	circle	,	so	i	get	out	of	the	house	a	fair	bit	.
and	in	my	nature	,	i	guess	,	i	am	a	doer	of	things	more	than	i	am	a	spectator	or	a	contemplator	of	things	,	and	it	's	that	dichotomy	,	the	gulf	between	ideas	and	action	that	i	'm	going	to	try	and	explore	briefly	.
the	pithiest	answer	to	the	question	``	why	?	``
that	's	been	dogging	me	for	the	last	12	years	was	credited	certainly	to	this	chap	,	the	rakish	-	looking	gentleman	standing	at	the	back	,	second	from	the	left	,	george	lee	mallory	.	many	of	you	will	know	his	name	.
in	1924	he	was	last	seen	disappearing	into	the	clouds	near	the	summit	of	mt	.	everest	.
he	may	or	may	not	have	been	the	first	person	to	climb	everest	,	more	than	30	years	before	edmund	hillary	.
no	one	knows	if	he	got	to	the	top	.	it	's	still	a	mystery	.
but	he	was	credited	with	coining	the	phrase	,	``	because	it	's	there	.	``
now	i	'm	not	actually	sure	that	he	did	say	that	.
there	's	very	little	evidence	to	suggest	it	,	but	what	he	did	say	is	actually	far	nicer	,	and	again	,	i	've	printed	this	.	i	'm	going	to	read	it	out	.
``	the	first	question	which	you	will	ask	and	which	i	must	try	to	answer	is	this	:	what	is	the	use	of	climbing	mt	.	everest	?
and	my	answer	must	at	once	be	,	it	is	no	use	.
there	is	not	the	slightest	prospect	of	any	gain	whatsoever	.
oh	,	we	may	learn	a	little	about	the	behavior	of	the	human	body	at	high	altitudes	,	and	possibly	medical	men	may	turn	our	observation	to	some	account	for	the	purposes	of	aviation	,	but	otherwise	nothing	will	come	of	it	.
we	shall	not	bring	back	a	single	bit	of	gold	or	silver	,	and	not	a	gem	,	nor	any	coal	or	iron	.
we	shall	not	find	a	single	foot	of	earth	that	can	be	planted	with	crops	to	raise	food	.	so	it	is	no	use	.
if	you	can	not	understand	that	there	is	something	in	man	which	responds	to	the	challenge	of	this	mountain	and	goes	out	to	meet	it	,	that	the	struggle	is	the	struggle	of	life	itself	upward	and	forever	upward	,	then	you	wo	n't	see	why	we	go	.
what	we	get	from	this	adventure	is	just	sheer	joy	,	and	joy	,	after	all	,	is	the	end	of	life	.
we	do	n't	live	to	eat	and	make	money	.
we	eat	and	make	money	to	be	able	to	enjoy	life	.
that	is	what	life	means	,	and	that	is	what	life	is	for	.	``
mallory	's	argument	that	leaving	the	house	,	embarking	on	these	grand	adventures	is	joyful	and	fun	,	however	,	does	n't	tally	that	neatly	with	my	own	experience	.
the	furthest	i	've	ever	got	away	from	my	front	door	was	in	the	spring	of	2004	.	i	still	do	n't	know	exactly	what	came	over	me	,	but	my	plan	was	to	make	a	solo	and	unsupported	crossing	of	the	arctic	ocean	.
i	planned	essentially	to	walk	from	the	north	coast	of	russia	to	the	north	pole	,	and	then	to	carry	on	to	the	north	coast	of	canada	.
no	one	had	ever	done	this	.	i	was	26	at	the	time	.
a	lot	of	experts	were	saying	it	was	impossible	,	and	my	mum	certainly	was	n't	very	keen	on	the	idea	.
the	journey	from	a	small	weather	station	on	the	north	coast	of	siberia	up	to	my	final	starting	point	,	the	edge	of	the	pack	ice	,	the	coast	of	the	arctic	ocean	,	took	about	five	hours	,	and	if	anyone	watched	fearless	felix	baumgartner	going	up	,	rather	than	just	coming	down	,	you	'll	appreciate	the	sense	of	apprehension	,	as	i	sat	in	a	helicopter	thundering	north	,	and	the	sense	,	i	think	if	anything	,	of	impending	doom	.
i	sat	there	wondering	what	on	earth	i	had	gotten	myself	into	.
there	was	a	bit	of	fun	,	a	bit	of	joy	.
i	was	26.	i	remember	sitting	there	looking	down	at	my	sledge	.	i	had	my	skis	ready	to	go	,	i	had	a	satellite	phone	,	a	pump	-	action	shotgun	in	case	i	was	attacked	by	a	polar	bear	.
i	remember	looking	out	of	the	window	and	seeing	the	second	helicopter	.
we	were	both	thundering	through	this	incredible	siberian	dawn	,	and	part	of	me	felt	a	bit	like	a	cross	between	jason	bourne	and	wilfred	thesiger	.	part	of	me	felt	quite	proud	of	myself	,	but	mostly	i	was	just	utterly	terrified	.
and	that	journey	lasted	10	weeks	,	72	days	.
i	did	n't	see	anyone	else	.	we	took	this	photo	next	to	the	helicopter	.
beyond	that	,	i	did	n't	see	anyone	for	10	weeks	.
the	north	pole	is	slap	bang	in	the	middle	of	the	sea	,	so	i	'm	traveling	over	the	frozen	surface	of	the	arctic	ocean	.
nasa	described	conditions	that	year	as	the	worst	since	records	began	.
i	was	dragging	180	kilos	of	food	and	fuel	and	supplies	,	about	400	pounds	.	the	average	temperature	for	the	10	weeks	was	minus	35.	minus	50	was	the	coldest	.
so	again	,	there	was	n't	an	awful	lot	of	joy	or	fun	to	be	had	.
one	of	the	magical	things	about	this	journey	,	however	,	is	that	because	i	'm	walking	over	the	sea	,	over	this	floating	,	drifting	,	shifting	crust	of	ice	that	's	floating	on	top	of	the	arctic	ocean	is	it	's	an	environment	that	's	in	a	constant	state	of	flux	.
the	ice	is	always	moving	,	breaking	up	,	drifting	around	,	refreezing	,	so	the	scenery	that	i	saw	for	nearly	3	months	was	unique	to	me	.	no	one	else	will	ever	,	could	ever	,	possibly	see	the	views	,	the	vistas	,	that	i	saw	for	10	weeks	.
and	that	,	i	guess	,	is	probably	the	finest	argument	for	leaving	the	house	.
i	can	try	to	tell	you	what	it	was	like	,	but	you	'll	never	know	what	it	was	like	,	and	the	more	i	try	to	explain	that	i	felt	lonely	,	i	was	the	only	human	being	in	5.4	million	square	-	miles	,	it	was	cold	,	nearly	minus	75	with	windchill	on	a	bad	day	,	the	more	words	fall	short	,	and	i	'm	unable	to	do	it	justice	.
and	it	seems	to	me	,	therefore	,	that	the	doing	,	you	know	,	to	try	to	experience	,	to	engage	,	to	endeavor	,	rather	than	to	watch	and	to	wonder	,	that	's	where	the	real	meat	of	life	is	to	be	found	,	the	juice	that	we	can	suck	out	of	our	hours	and	days	.
and	i	would	add	a	cautionary	note	here	,	however	.
in	my	experience	,	there	is	something	addictive	about	tasting	life	at	the	very	edge	of	what	's	humanly	possible	.
now	i	do	n't	just	mean	in	the	field	of	daft	macho	edwardian	style	derring	-	do	,	but	also	in	the	fields	of	pancreatic	cancer	,	there	is	something	addictive	about	this	,	and	in	my	case	,	i	think	polar	expeditions	are	perhaps	not	that	far	removed	from	having	a	crack	habit	.
i	ca	n't	explain	quite	how	good	it	is	until	you	've	tried	it	,	but	it	has	the	capacity	to	burn	up	all	the	money	i	can	get	my	hands	on	,	to	ruin	every	relationship	i	've	ever	had	,	so	be	careful	what	you	wish	for	.
mallory	postulated	that	there	is	something	in	man	that	responds	to	the	challenge	of	the	mountain	,	and	i	wonder	if	that	's	the	case	whether	there	's	something	in	the	challenge	itself	,	in	the	endeavor	,	and	particularly	in	the	big	,	unfinished	,	chunky	challenges	that	face	humanity	that	call	out	to	us	,	and	in	my	experience	that	's	certainly	the	case	.
there	is	one	unfinished	challenge	that	's	been	calling	out	to	me	for	most	of	my	adult	life	.
many	of	you	will	know	the	story	.
this	is	a	photo	of	captain	scott	and	his	team	.
scott	set	out	just	over	a	hundred	years	ago	to	try	to	become	the	first	person	to	reach	the	south	pole	.
no	one	knew	what	was	there	.	it	was	utterly	unmapped	at	the	time	.	we	knew	more	about	the	surface	of	the	moon	than	we	did	about	the	heart	of	antarctica	.
scott	,	as	many	of	you	will	know	,	was	beaten	to	it	by	roald	amundsen	and	his	norwegian	team	,	who	used	dogs	and	dogsleds	.	scott	's	team	were	on	foot	,	all	five	of	them	wearing	harnesses	and	dragging	around	sledges	,	and	they	arrived	at	the	pole	to	find	the	norwegian	flag	already	there	,	i	'd	imagine	pretty	bitter	and	demoralized	.
all	five	of	them	turned	and	started	walking	back	to	the	coast	and	all	five	died	on	that	return	journey	.
there	is	a	sort	of	misconception	nowadays	that	it	's	all	been	done	in	the	fields	of	exploration	and	adventure	.
when	i	talk	about	antarctica	,	people	often	say	,	``	has	n't	,	you	know	,	that	's	interesting	,	has	n't	that	blue	peter	presenter	just	done	it	on	a	bike	?	``
or	,	``	that	's	nice	.	you	know	,	my	grandmother	's	going	on	a	cruise	to	antarctica	next	year	.	you	know	.
is	there	a	chance	you	'll	see	her	there	?	``
but	scott	's	journey	remains	unfinished	.
no	one	has	ever	walked	from	the	very	coast	of	antarctica	to	the	south	pole	and	back	again	.
it	is	,	arguably	,	the	most	audacious	endeavor	of	that	edwardian	golden	age	of	exploration	,	and	it	seemed	to	me	high	time	,	given	everything	we	have	figured	out	in	the	century	since	from	scurvy	to	solar	panels	,	that	it	was	high	time	someone	had	a	go	at	finishing	the	job	.
so	that	's	precisely	what	i	'm	setting	out	to	do	.
this	time	next	year	,	in	october	,	i	'm	leading	a	team	of	three	.
it	will	take	us	about	four	months	to	make	this	return	journey	.
that	's	the	scale	.	the	red	line	is	obviously	halfway	to	the	pole	.
we	have	to	turn	around	and	come	back	again	.
i	'm	well	aware	of	the	irony	of	telling	you	that	we	will	be	blogging	and	tweeting	.	you	'll	be	able	to	live	vicariously	and	virtually	through	this	journey	in	a	way	that	no	one	has	ever	before	.
and	it	'll	also	be	a	four	-	month	chance	for	me	to	finally	come	up	with	a	pithy	answer	to	the	question	,	``	why	?	``
and	our	lives	today	are	safer	and	more	comfortable	than	they	have	ever	been	.	there	certainly	is	n't	much	call	for	explorers	nowadays	.	my	career	advisor	at	school	never	mentioned	it	as	an	option	.
if	i	wanted	to	know	,	for	example	,	how	many	stars	were	in	the	milky	way	,	how	old	those	giant	heads	on	easter	island	were	,	most	of	you	could	find	that	out	right	now	without	even	standing	up	.
and	yet	,	if	i	've	learned	anything	in	nearly	12	years	now	of	dragging	heavy	things	around	cold	places	,	it	is	that	true	,	real	inspiration	and	growth	only	comes	from	adversity	and	from	challenge	,	from	stepping	away	from	what	's	comfortable	and	familiar	and	stepping	out	into	the	unknown	.
in	life	,	we	all	have	tempests	to	ride	and	poles	to	walk	to	,	and	i	think	metaphorically	speaking	,	at	least	,	we	could	all	benefit	from	getting	outside	the	house	a	little	more	often	,	if	only	we	could	sum	up	the	courage	.
i	certainly	would	implore	you	to	open	the	door	just	a	little	bit	and	take	a	look	at	what	's	outside	.
thank	you	very	much	.
