well	,	i	was	born	with	a	rare	visual	condition	called	achromatopsia	,	which	is	total	color	blindness	,	so	i	've	never	seen	color	,	and	i	do	n't	know	what	color	looks	like	,	because	i	come	from	a	grayscale	world	.
to	me	,	the	sky	is	always	gray	,	flowers	are	always	gray	,	and	television	is	still	in	black	and	white	.
but	,	since	the	age	of	21	,	instead	of	seeing	color	,	i	can	hear	color	.
in	2003	,	i	started	a	project	with	computer	scientist	adam	montandon	,	and	the	result	,	with	further	collaborations	with	peter	kese	from	slovenia	and	matias	lizana	from	barcelona	,	is	this	electronic	eye	.
it	's	a	color	sensor	that	detects	the	color	frequency	in	front	of	me	--	--	and	sends	this	frequency	to	a	chip	installed	at	the	back	of	my	head	,	and	i	hear	the	color	in	front	of	me	through	the	bone	,	through	bone	conduction	.
so	,	for	example	,	if	i	have	,	like	--	this	is	the	sound	of	purple	.
for	example	,	this	is	the	sound	of	grass	.
this	is	red	,	like	ted	.
this	is	the	sound	of	a	dirty	sock	.
which	is	like	yellow	,	this	one	.
so	i	've	been	hearing	color	all	the	time	for	eight	years	,	since	2004	,	so	i	find	it	completely	normal	now	to	hear	color	all	the	time	.
at	the	start	,	though	,	i	had	to	memorize	the	names	you	give	for	each	color	,	so	i	had	to	memorize	the	notes	,	but	after	some	time	,	all	this	information	became	a	perception	.
i	did	n't	have	to	think	about	the	notes	.
and	after	some	time	,	this	perception	became	a	feeling	.
i	started	to	have	favorite	colors	,	and	i	started	to	dream	in	colors	.
so	,	when	i	started	to	dream	in	color	is	when	i	felt	that	the	software	and	my	brain	had	united	,	because	in	my	dreams	,	it	was	my	brain	creating	electronic	sounds	.	it	was	n't	the	software	,	so	that	's	when	i	started	to	feel	like	a	cyborg	.
it	's	when	i	started	to	feel	that	the	cybernetic	device	was	no	longer	a	device	.
it	had	become	a	part	of	my	body	,	an	extension	of	my	senses	,	and	after	some	time	,	it	even	became	a	part	of	my	official	image	.
this	is	my	passport	from	2004	.
you	're	not	allowed	to	appear	on	u.k.	passports	with	electronic	equipment	,	but	i	insisted	to	the	passport	office	that	what	they	were	seeing	was	actually	a	new	part	of	my	body	,	an	extension	of	my	brain	,	and	they	finally	accepted	me	to	appear	with	the	passport	photo	.
so	,	life	has	changed	dramatically	since	i	hear	color	,	because	color	is	almost	everywhere	,	so	the	biggest	change	for	example	is	going	to	an	art	gallery	,	i	can	listen	to	a	picasso	,	for	example	.	so	it	's	like	i	'm	going	to	a	concert	hall	,	because	i	can	listen	to	the	paintings	.
and	supermarkets	,	i	find	this	is	very	shocking	,	it	's	very	,	very	attractive	to	walk	along	a	supermarket	.
it	's	like	going	to	a	nightclub	.
it	's	full	of	different	melodies	.	yeah	.
especially	the	aisle	with	cleaning	products	.
it	's	just	fabulous	.
also	,	the	way	i	dress	has	changed	.
before	,	i	used	to	dress	in	a	way	that	it	looked	good	.
now	i	dress	in	a	way	that	it	sounds	good	.
so	today	i	'm	dressed	in	c	major	,	so	it	's	quite	a	happy	chord	.
if	i	had	to	go	to	a	funeral	,	though	,	i	would	dress	in	b	minor	,	which	would	be	turquoise	,	purple	and	orange	.
also	,	food	,	the	way	i	look	at	food	has	changed	,	because	now	i	can	display	the	food	on	a	plate	,	so	i	can	eat	my	favorite	song	.
so	depending	on	how	i	display	it	,	i	can	hear	and	i	can	compose	music	with	food	.
so	imagine	a	restaurant	where	we	can	have	,	like	,	lady	gaga	salads	as	starters	.	i	mean	,	this	would	get	teenagers	to	eat	their	vegetables	,	probably	.
and	also	,	some	rachmaninov	piano	concertos	as	main	dishes	,	and	some	bjork	or	madonna	desserts	,	that	would	be	a	very	exciting	restaurant	where	you	can	actually	eat	songs	.
also	,	the	way	i	perceive	beauty	has	changed	,	because	when	i	look	at	someone	,	i	hear	their	face	,	so	someone	might	look	very	beautiful	but	sound	terrible	.
and	it	might	happen	the	opposite	,	the	other	way	around	.	so	i	really	enjoy	creating	,	like	,	sound	portraits	of	people	.
instead	of	drawing	someone	's	face	,	like	drawing	the	shape	,	i	point	at	them	with	the	eye	and	i	write	down	the	different	notes	i	hear	,	and	then	i	create	sound	portraits	.
here	's	some	faces	.
yeah	,	nicole	kidman	sounds	good	.
some	people	,	i	would	never	relate	,	but	they	sound	similar	.
prince	charles	has	some	similarities	with	nicole	kidman	.
they	have	similar	sound	of	eyes	.
so	you	relate	people	that	you	would	n't	relate	,	and	you	can	actually	also	create	concerts	by	looking	at	the	audience	faces	.
so	i	connect	the	eye	,	and	then	i	play	the	audience	's	faces	.
the	good	thing	about	this	is	,	if	the	concert	does	n't	sound	good	,	it	's	their	fault	.
it	's	not	my	fault	,	because	--	and	so	another	thing	that	happens	is	that	i	started	having	this	secondary	effect	that	normal	sounds	started	to	become	color	.
i	heard	a	telephone	tone	,	and	it	felt	green	because	it	sounded	just	like	the	color	green	.
the	bbc	beeps	,	they	sound	turquoise	,	and	listening	to	mozart	became	a	yellow	experience	,	so	i	started	to	paint	music	and	paint	people	's	voices	,	because	people	's	voices	have	frequencies	that	i	relate	to	color	.
and	here	's	some	music	translated	into	color	.
for	example	,	mozart	,	``	queen	of	the	night	,	``	looks	like	this	.
very	yellow	and	very	colorful	,	because	there	's	many	different	frequencies	.
and	this	is	a	completely	different	song	.
it	's	justin	bieber	's	``	baby	.	``
it	is	very	pink	and	very	yellow	.
so	,	also	voices	,	i	can	transform	speeches	into	color	,	for	example	,	these	are	two	very	well	-	known	speeches	.
one	of	them	is	martin	luther	king	's	``	i	have	a	dream	,	``	and	the	other	one	is	hitler	.
and	i	like	to	exhibit	these	paintings	in	the	exhibition	halls	without	labels	,	and	then	i	ask	people	,	``	which	one	do	you	prefer	?	``
and	most	people	change	their	preference	when	i	tell	them	that	the	one	on	the	left	is	hitler	and	the	one	on	the	right	is	martin	luther	king	.
so	i	got	to	a	point	when	i	was	able	to	perceive	360	colors	,	just	like	human	vision	.
i	was	able	to	differentiate	all	the	degrees	of	the	color	wheel	.
but	then	,	i	just	thought	that	this	human	vision	was	n't	good	enough	.
there	's	many	,	many	more	colors	around	us	that	we	can	not	perceive	,	but	that	electronic	eyes	can	perceive	.
so	i	decided	to	continue	extending	my	color	senses	,	and	i	added	infrared	and	i	added	ultraviolet	to	the	color	-	to	-	sound	scale	,	so	now	i	can	hear	colors	that	the	human	eye	can	not	perceive	.
for	example	,	perceiving	infrared	is	good	because	you	can	actually	detect	if	there	's	movement	detectors	in	a	room	.
i	can	hear	if	someone	points	at	me	with	a	remote	control	.
and	the	good	thing	about	perceiving	ultraviolet	is	that	you	can	hear	if	it	's	a	good	day	or	a	bad	day	to	sunbathe	,	because	ultraviolet	is	a	dangerous	color	,	a	color	that	can	actually	kill	us	,	so	i	think	we	should	all	have	this	wish	to	perceive	things	that	we	can	not	perceive	.
that	's	why	,	two	years	ago	,	i	created	the	cyborg	foundation	,	which	is	a	foundation	that	tries	to	help	people	become	a	cyborg	,	tries	to	encourage	people	to	extend	their	senses	by	using	technology	as	part	of	the	body	.
we	should	all	think	that	knowledge	comes	from	our	senses	,	so	if	we	extend	our	senses	,	we	will	consequently	extend	our	knowledge	.
i	think	life	will	be	much	more	exciting	when	we	stop	creating	applications	for	mobile	phones	and	we	start	creating	applications	for	our	own	body	.
i	think	this	will	be	a	big	,	big	change	that	we	will	see	during	this	century	.
so	i	do	encourage	you	all	to	think	about	which	senses	you	'd	like	to	extend	.
i	would	encourage	you	to	become	a	cyborg	.
you	wo	n't	be	alone	.	thank	you	.
