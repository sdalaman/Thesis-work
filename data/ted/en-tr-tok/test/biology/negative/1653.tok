the	theme	of	my	talk	today	is	,	``	be	an	artist	,	right	now	.	``
most	people	,	when	this	subject	is	brought	up	,	get	tense	and	resist	it	:	``	art	does	n't	feed	me	,	and	right	now	i	'm	busy	.
i	have	to	go	to	school	,	get	a	job	,	send	my	kids	to	lessons	...	``	you	think	,	``	i	'm	too	busy	.	i	do	n't	have	time	for	art	.	``
there	are	hundreds	of	reasons	why	we	ca	n't	be	artists	right	now	.
do	n't	they	just	pop	into	your	head	?
there	are	so	many	reasons	why	we	ca	n't	be	,	indeed	,	we	're	not	sure	why	we	should	be	.
we	do	n't	know	why	we	should	be	artists	,	but	we	have	many	reasons	why	we	ca	n't	be	.
why	do	people	instantly	resist	the	idea	of	associating	themselves	with	art	?
perhaps	you	think	art	is	for	the	greatly	gifted	or	for	the	thoroughly	and	professionally	trained	.
and	some	of	you	may	think	you	've	strayed	too	far	from	art	.
well	you	might	have	,	but	i	do	n't	think	so	.
this	is	the	theme	of	my	talk	today	.
we	are	all	born	artists	.
if	you	have	kids	,	you	know	what	i	mean	.
almost	everything	kids	do	is	art	.
they	draw	with	crayons	on	the	wall	.
they	dance	to	son	dam	bi	's	dance	on	tv	,	but	you	ca	n't	even	call	it	son	dam	bi	's	dance	--	it	becomes	the	kids	'	own	dance	.
so	they	dance	a	strange	dance	and	inflict	their	singing	on	everyone	.
perhaps	their	art	is	something	only	their	parents	can	bear	,	and	because	they	practice	such	art	all	day	long	,	people	honestly	get	a	little	tired	around	kids	.
kids	will	sometimes	perform	monodramas	--	playing	house	is	indeed	a	monodrama	or	a	play	.
and	some	kids	,	when	they	get	a	bit	older	,	start	to	lie	.
usually	parents	remember	the	very	first	time	their	kid	lies	.
they	're	shocked	.
``	now	you	're	showing	your	true	colors	,	``	mom	says	.	she	thinks	,	``	why	does	he	take	after	his	dad	?	``
she	questions	him	,	``	what	kind	of	a	person	are	you	going	to	be	?	``
but	you	should	n't	worry	.
the	moment	kids	start	to	lie	is	the	moment	storytelling	begins	.
they	are	talking	about	things	they	did	n't	see	.
it	's	amazing	.	it	's	a	wonderful	moment	.
parents	should	celebrate	.
``	hurray	!	my	boy	finally	started	to	lie	!	``
all	right	!	it	calls	for	celebration	.
for	example	,	a	kid	says	,	``	mom	,	guess	what	?	i	met	an	alien	on	my	way	home	.	``
then	a	typical	mom	responds	,	``	stop	that	nonsense	.	``
now	,	an	ideal	parent	is	someone	who	responds	like	this	:	``	really	?	an	alien	,	huh	?	what	did	it	look	like	?	did	it	say	anything	?
where	did	you	meet	it	?	``	``	um	,	in	front	of	the	supermarket	.	``
when	you	have	a	conversation	like	this	,	the	kid	has	to	come	up	with	the	next	thing	to	say	to	be	responsible	for	what	he	started	.
soon	,	a	story	develops	.
of	course	this	is	an	infantile	story	,	but	thinking	up	one	sentence	after	the	next	is	the	same	thing	a	professional	writer	like	me	does	.
in	essence	,	they	are	not	different	.
roland	barthes	once	said	of	flaubert	's	novels	,	``	flaubert	did	not	write	a	novel	.
he	merely	connected	one	sentence	after	another	.
the	eros	between	sentences	,	that	is	the	essence	of	flaubert	's	novel	.	``
that	's	right	--	a	novel	,	basically	,	is	writing	one	sentence	,	then	,	without	violating	the	scope	of	the	first	one	,	writing	the	next	sentence	.
and	you	continue	to	make	connections	.
take	a	look	at	this	sentence	:	``	one	morning	,	as	gregor	samsa	was	waking	up	from	anxious	dreams	,	he	discovered	that	in	his	bed	he	had	been	changed	into	a	monstrous	verminous	bug	.	``
yes	,	it	's	the	first	sentence	of	franz	kafka	's	``	the	metamorphosis	.	``
writing	such	an	unjustifiable	sentence	and	continuing	in	order	to	justify	it	,	kafka	's	work	became	the	masterpiece	of	contemporary	literature	.
kafka	did	not	show	his	work	to	his	father	.
he	was	not	on	good	terms	with	his	father	.
on	his	own	,	he	wrote	these	sentences	.
had	he	shown	his	father	,	``	my	boy	has	finally	lost	it	,	``	he	would	've	thought	.
and	that	's	right	.	art	is	about	going	a	little	nuts	and	justifying	the	next	sentence	,	which	is	not	much	different	from	what	a	kid	does	.
a	kid	who	has	just	started	to	lie	is	taking	the	first	step	as	a	storyteller	.
kids	do	art	.
they	do	n't	get	tired	and	they	have	fun	doing	it	.
i	was	in	jeju	island	a	few	days	ago	.
when	kids	are	on	the	beach	,	most	of	them	love	playing	in	the	water	.
but	some	of	them	spend	a	lot	of	time	in	the	sand	,	making	mountains	and	seas	--	well	,	not	seas	,	but	different	things	--	people	and	dogs	,	etc	.
but	parents	tell	them	,	``	it	will	all	be	washed	away	by	the	waves	.	``
in	other	words	,	it	's	useless	.
there	's	no	need	.
but	kids	do	n't	mind	.
they	have	fun	in	the	moment	and	they	keep	playing	in	the	sand	.
kids	do	n't	do	it	because	someone	told	them	to	.
they	are	n't	told	by	their	boss	or	anyone	,	they	just	do	it	.
when	you	were	little	,	i	bet	you	spent	time	enjoying	the	pleasure	of	primitive	art	.
when	i	ask	my	students	to	write	about	their	happiest	moment	,	many	write	about	an	early	artistic	experience	they	had	as	a	kid	.
learning	to	play	piano	for	the	first	time	and	playing	four	hands	with	a	friend	,	or	performing	a	ridiculous	skit	with	friends	looking	like	idiots	--	things	like	that	.
or	the	moment	you	developed	the	first	film	you	shot	with	an	old	camera	.
they	talk	about	these	kinds	of	experiences	.
you	must	have	had	such	a	moment	.
in	that	moment	,	art	makes	you	happy	because	it	's	not	work	.
work	does	n't	make	you	happy	,	does	it	?	mostly	it	's	tough	.
the	french	writer	michel	tournier	has	a	famous	saying	.
it	's	a	bit	mischievous	,	actually	.
``	work	is	against	human	nature	.	the	proof	is	that	it	makes	us	tired	.	``
right	?	why	would	work	tire	us	if	it	's	in	our	nature	?
playing	does	n't	tire	us	.
we	can	play	all	night	long	.
if	we	work	overnight	,	we	should	be	paid	for	overtime	.
why	?	because	it	's	tiring	and	we	feel	fatigue	.
but	kids	,	usually	they	do	art	for	fun	.	it	's	playing	.
they	do	n't	draw	to	sell	the	work	to	a	client	or	play	the	piano	to	earn	money	for	the	family	.
of	course	,	there	were	kids	who	had	to	.
you	know	this	gentleman	,	right	?
he	had	to	tour	around	europe	to	support	his	family	--	wolfgang	amadeus	mozart	--	but	that	was	centuries	ago	,	so	we	can	make	him	an	exception	.
unfortunately	,	at	some	point	our	art	--	such	a	joyful	pastime	--	ends	.
kids	have	to	go	to	lessons	,	to	school	,	do	homework	and	of	course	they	take	piano	or	ballet	lessons	,	but	they	are	n't	fun	anymore	.
you	're	told	to	do	it	and	there	's	competition	.	how	can	it	be	fun	?
if	you	're	in	elementary	school	and	you	still	draw	on	the	wall	,	you	'll	surely	get	in	trouble	with	your	mom	.
besides	,	if	you	continue	to	act	like	an	artist	as	you	get	older	,	you	'll	increasingly	feel	pressure	--	people	will	question	your	actions	and	ask	you	to	act	properly	.
here	's	my	story	:	i	was	an	eighth	grader	and	i	entered	a	drawing	contest	at	school	in	gyeongbokgung	.
i	was	trying	my	best	,	and	my	teacher	came	around	and	asked	me	,	``	what	are	you	doing	?	``
``	i	'm	drawing	diligently	,	``	i	said	.
``	why	are	you	using	only	black	?	``
indeed	,	i	was	eagerly	coloring	the	sketchbook	in	black	.
and	i	explained	,	``	it	's	a	dark	night	and	a	crow	is	perching	on	a	branch	.	``
then	my	teacher	said	,	``	really	?	well	,	young	-	ha	,	you	may	not	be	good	at	drawing	but	you	have	a	talent	for	storytelling	.	``
or	so	i	wished	.
``	now	you	'll	get	it	,	you	rascal	!	``	was	the	response	.
``	you	'll	get	it	!	``	he	said	.
you	were	supposed	to	draw	the	palace	,	the	gyeonghoeru	,	etc	.	,	but	i	was	coloring	everything	in	black	,	so	he	dragged	me	out	of	the	group	.
there	were	a	lot	of	girls	there	as	well	,	so	i	was	utterly	mortified	.
none	of	my	explanations	or	excuses	were	heard	,	and	i	really	got	it	big	time	.
if	he	was	an	ideal	teacher	,	he	would	have	responded	like	i	said	before	,	``	young	-	ha	may	not	have	a	talent	for	drawing	,	but	he	has	a	gift	for	making	up	stories	,	``	and	he	would	have	encouraged	me	.
but	such	a	teacher	is	seldom	found	.
later	,	i	grew	up	and	went	to	europe	's	galleries	--	i	was	a	university	student	--	and	i	thought	this	was	really	unfair	.
look	what	i	found	.
works	like	this	were	hung	in	basel	while	i	was	punished	and	stood	in	front	of	the	palace	with	my	drawing	in	my	mouth	.
look	at	this	.	does	n't	it	look	just	like	wallpaper	?
contemporary	art	,	i	later	discovered	,	is	n't	explained	by	a	lame	story	like	mine	.
no	crows	are	brought	up	.
most	of	the	works	have	no	title	,	untitled	.
anyways	,	contemporary	art	in	the	20th	century	is	about	doing	something	weird	and	filling	the	void	with	explanation	and	interpretation	--	essentially	the	same	as	i	did	.
of	course	,	my	work	was	very	amateur	,	but	let	's	turn	to	more	famous	examples	.
this	is	picasso	's	.
he	stuck	handlebars	into	a	bike	seat	and	called	it	``	bull	's	head	.	``	sounds	convincing	,	right	?
next	,	a	urinal	was	placed	on	its	side	and	called	``	fountain	``	.
that	was	duchamp	.
so	filling	the	gap	between	explanation	and	a	weird	act	with	stories	--	that	's	indeed	what	contemporary	art	is	all	about	.
picasso	even	made	the	statement	,	``	i	draw	not	what	i	see	but	what	i	think	.	``
yes	,	it	means	i	did	n't	have	to	draw	gyeonghoeru	.
i	wish	i	knew	what	picasso	said	back	then	.	i	could	have	argued	better	with	my	teacher	.
unfortunately	,	the	little	artists	within	us	are	choked	to	death	before	we	get	to	fight	against	the	oppressors	of	art	.
they	get	locked	in	.
that	's	our	tragedy	.
so	what	happens	when	little	artists	get	locked	in	,	banished	or	even	killed	?
our	artistic	desire	does	n't	go	away	.
we	want	to	express	,	to	reveal	ourselves	,	but	with	the	artist	dead	,	the	artistic	desire	reveals	itself	in	dark	form	.
in	karaoke	bars	,	there	are	always	people	who	sing	``	she	's	gone	``	or	``	hotel	california	,	``	miming	the	guitar	riffs	.
usually	they	sound	awful	.	awful	indeed	.
some	people	turn	into	rockers	like	this	.
or	some	people	dance	in	clubs	.
people	who	would	have	enjoyed	telling	stories	end	up	trolling	on	the	internet	all	night	long	.
that	's	how	a	writing	talent	reveals	itself	on	the	dark	side	.
sometimes	we	see	dads	get	more	excited	than	their	kids	playing	with	legos	or	putting	together	plastic	robots	.
they	go	,	``	do	n't	touch	it	.	daddy	will	do	it	for	you	.	``
the	kid	has	already	lost	interest	and	is	doing	something	else	,	but	the	dad	alone	builds	castles	.
this	shows	the	artistic	impulses	inside	us	are	suppressed	,	not	gone	.
but	they	can	often	reveal	themselves	negatively	,	in	the	form	of	jealousy	.
you	know	the	song	``	i	would	love	to	be	on	tv	``	?	why	would	we	love	it	?
tv	is	full	of	people	who	do	what	we	wished	to	do	,	but	never	got	to	.
they	dance	,	they	act	--	and	the	more	they	do	,	they	are	praised	.
so	we	start	to	envy	them	.
we	become	dictators	with	a	remote	and	start	to	criticize	the	people	on	tv	.
``	he	just	ca	n't	act	.	``	``	you	call	that	singing	?	she	ca	n't	hit	the	notes	.	``
we	easily	say	these	sorts	of	things	.
we	get	jealous	,	not	because	we	're	evil	,	but	because	we	have	little	artists	pent	up	inside	us	.
that	's	what	i	think	.
what	should	we	do	then	?
yes	,	that	's	right	.
right	now	,	we	need	to	start	our	own	art	.
right	this	minute	,	we	can	turn	off	tv	,	log	off	the	internet	,	get	up	and	start	to	do	something	.
where	i	teach	students	in	drama	school	,	there	's	a	course	called	dramatics	.
in	this	course	,	all	students	must	put	on	a	play	.
however	,	acting	majors	are	not	supposed	to	act	.
they	can	write	the	play	,	for	example	,	and	the	writers	may	work	on	stage	art	.
likewise	,	stage	art	majors	may	become	actors	,	and	in	this	way	you	put	on	a	show	.
students	at	first	wonder	whether	they	can	actually	do	it	,	but	later	they	have	so	much	fun	.	i	rarely	see	anyone	who	is	miserable	doing	a	play	.
in	school	,	the	military	or	even	in	a	mental	institution	,	once	you	make	people	do	it	,	they	enjoy	it	.
i	saw	this	happen	in	the	army	--	many	people	had	fun	doing	plays	.
i	have	another	experience	:	in	my	writing	class	,	i	give	students	a	special	assignment	.
i	have	students	like	you	in	the	class	--	many	who	do	n't	major	in	writing	.
some	major	in	art	or	music	and	think	they	ca	n't	write	.
so	i	give	them	blank	sheets	of	paper	and	a	theme	.
it	can	be	a	simple	theme	:	write	about	the	most	unfortunate	experience	in	your	childhood	.
there	's	one	condition	:	you	must	write	like	crazy	.	like	crazy	!
i	walk	around	and	encourage	them	,	``	come	on	,	come	on	!	``	they	have	to	write	like	crazy	for	an	hour	or	two	.
they	only	get	to	think	for	the	first	five	minutes	.
the	reason	i	make	them	write	like	crazy	is	because	when	you	write	slowly	and	lots	of	thoughts	cross	your	mind	,	the	artistic	devil	creeps	in	.
this	devil	will	tell	you	hundreds	of	reasons	why	you	ca	n't	write	:	``	people	will	laugh	at	you	.	this	is	not	good	writing	!
what	kind	of	sentence	is	this	?	look	at	your	handwriting	!	``
it	will	say	a	lot	of	things	.
you	have	to	run	fast	so	the	devil	ca	n't	catch	up	.
the	really	good	writing	i	've	seen	in	my	class	was	not	from	the	assignments	with	a	long	deadline	,	but	from	the	40-	to	60	-	minute	crazy	writing	students	did	in	front	of	me	with	a	pencil	.
the	students	go	into	a	kind	of	trance	.
after	30	or	40	minutes	,	they	write	without	knowing	what	they	're	writing	.
and	in	this	moment	,	the	nagging	devil	disappears	.
so	i	can	say	this	:	it	's	not	the	hundreds	of	reasons	why	one	ca	n't	be	an	artist	,	but	rather	,	the	one	reason	one	must	be	that	makes	us	artists	.
why	we	can	not	be	something	is	not	important	.
most	artists	became	artists	because	of	the	one	reason	.
when	we	put	the	devil	in	our	heart	to	sleep	and	start	our	own	art	,	enemies	appear	on	the	outside	.
mostly	,	they	have	the	faces	of	our	parents	.
sometimes	they	look	like	our	spouses	,	but	they	are	not	your	parents	or	spouses	.
they	are	devils	.	devils	.
they	came	to	earth	briefly	transformed	to	stop	you	from	being	artistic	,	from	becoming	artists	.
and	they	have	a	magic	question	.
when	we	say	,	``	i	think	i	'll	try	acting	.	there	's	a	drama	school	in	the	community	center	,	``	or	``	i	'd	like	to	learn	italian	songs	,	``	they	ask	,	``	oh	,	yeah	?	a	play	?	what	for	?	``
the	magic	question	is	,	``	what	for	?	``
but	art	is	not	for	anything	.
art	is	the	ultimate	goal	.
it	saves	our	souls	and	makes	us	live	happily	.
it	helps	us	express	ourselves	and	be	happy	without	the	help	of	alcohol	or	drugs	.
so	in	response	to	such	a	pragmatic	question	,	we	need	to	be	bold	.
``	well	,	just	for	the	fun	of	it	.	sorry	for	having	fun	without	you	,	``	is	what	you	should	say	.	``	i	'll	just	go	ahead	and	do	it	anyway	.	``
the	ideal	future	i	imagine	is	where	we	all	have	multiple	identities	,	at	least	one	of	which	is	an	artist	.
once	i	was	in	new	york	and	got	in	a	cab	.	i	took	the	backseat	,	and	in	front	of	me	i	saw	something	related	to	a	play	.
so	i	asked	the	driver	,	``	what	is	this	?	``
he	said	it	was	his	profile	.	``	then	what	are	you	?	``	i	asked	.	``	an	actor	,	``	he	said	.
he	was	a	cabby	and	an	actor	.	i	asked	,	``	what	roles	do	you	usually	play	?	``
he	proudly	said	he	played	king	lear	.
king	lear	.
``	who	is	it	that	can	tell	me	who	i	am	?	``	--	a	great	line	from	king	lear	.
that	's	the	world	i	dream	of	.
someone	is	a	golfer	by	day	and	writer	by	night	.
or	a	cabby	and	an	actor	,	a	banker	and	a	painter	,	secretly	or	publicly	performing	their	own	arts	.
in	1990	,	martha	graham	,	the	legend	of	modern	dance	,	came	to	korea	.
the	great	artist	,	then	in	her	90s	,	arrived	at	gimpo	airport	and	a	reporter	asked	her	a	typical	question	:	``	what	do	you	have	to	do	to	become	a	great	dancer	?
any	advice	for	aspiring	korean	dancers	?	``
now	,	she	was	the	master	.	this	photo	was	taken	in	1948	and	she	was	already	a	celebrated	artist	.
in	1990	,	she	was	asked	this	question	.
and	here	's	what	she	answered	:	``	just	do	it	.	``
wow	.	i	was	touched	.
only	those	three	words	and	she	left	the	airport	.	that	's	it	.
so	what	should	we	do	now	?
let	's	be	artists	,	right	now	.	right	away	.	how	?
just	do	it	!
thank	you	.
