good	morning	.	my	name	is	david	rose	.
i	am	a	serial	entrepreneur	turned	serial	investor	.
and	by	the	use	of	pitching	powerpoints	to	vcs	,	i	have	personally	raised	tens	of	millions	of	dollars	from	vcs	through	powerpoint	pitches	.
and	then	,	turning	round	to	the	other	side	of	the	equation	,	i	have	personally	supervised	the	investment	of	tens	of	millions	of	dollars	into	companies	who	have	been	pitching	me	with	powerpoint	presentations	.
so	i	think	it	's	safe	to	say	i	know	a	little	bit	about	the	process	of	pitching	.
so	,	the	very	first	question	that	you	've	all	got	to	figure	out	is	:	what	is	the	single	most	important	thing	that	a	vc	is	looking	for	when	you	come	to	them	pitching	your	new	business	idea	?
and	there	are	obviously	all	kinds	of	things	.
there	are	business	models	,	and	there	are	financials	,	and	there	are	markets	and	there	is	that	.	overall	,	of	all	the	things	that	you	have	to	do	,	what	is	the	single	most	important	thing	the	vc	is	going	to	be	investing	in	?
somebody	?	what	?
david	s.	rose	:	people	?	you	!	that	's	it	--	you	are	the	person	.
and	so	therefore	,	the	entire	purpose	of	a	vc	pitch	is	to	convince	them	that	you	are	the	entrepreneur	in	whom	they	are	going	to	invest	their	money	and	make	a	lot	of	money	in	return	.
now	,	how	do	you	do	this	?
you	ca	n't	just	walk	up	and	say	,	you	know	,	``	hi	,	i	'm	a	really	good	guy	,	and	a	good	girl	,	and	you	should	really	invest	in	me	.	``	right	?
so	,	in	the	course	of	your	vc	pitch	,	you	have	a	very	few	minutes	,	and	most	vc	pitches	--	most	angel	pitches	are	about	15	minutes	,	most	vc	pitches	should	be	less	than	half	an	hour	.
people	's	attention	span	after	18	minutes	begins	to	drop	off	,	tests	have	shown	.
so	in	that	18	minutes	,	or	10	minutes	,	or	five	minutes	,	you	have	to	convey	a	whole	bunch	of	different	characteristics	.
you	actually	have	to	convey	about	10	different	characteristics	while	you	're	standing	up	there	.
what	's	the	single	most	important	thing	you	've	got	to	convey	?
what	?
dsr	:	boy	,	oh	boy	,	oh	boy	!	and	that	's	a	straight	line	we	got	right	over	there	.	and	i	did	n't	even	prompt	him	.
you	're	right	,	integrity	.	because	that	's	the	key	thing	.
i	would	much	rather	invest	in	somebody	--	you	know	,	take	a	chance	on	somebody	--	who	i	know	is	straight	than	somebody	where	there	's	any	possible	question	of	,	you	know	,	who	are	they	looking	out	for	,	and	what	's	going	on	.
so	the	most	important	thing	is	integrity	.
and	what	's	the	second	most	important	thing	after	integrity	?
let	's	see	if	you	can	get	this	one	.
dsr	:	close	enough	!	passion	.
right	,	so	here	you	want	--	entrepreneurs	by	definition	are	people	who	are	leaving	something	else	,	starting	a	new	world	over	here	,	creating	and	putting	their	lifeblood	into	this	kind	of	thing	.
you	've	got	to	convey	passion	.
if	you	're	not	passionate	about	your	own	company	,	why	on	earth	should	anyone	else	be	passionate	?
why	should	they	put	more	money	into	your	company	,	if	you	're	not	passionate	about	it	?
so	,	integrity	and	passion	:	the	single	most	important	things	out	there	.
then	there	are	a	whole	panoply	of	other	things	that	you	've	got	to	do	,	to	wrap	up	in	this	package	that	you	're	presenting	to	a	vc	.
experience	.
you	've	got	to	be	able	to	say	,	``	hey	,	you	know	,	i	've	done	this	before	.	``
and	``	done	this	before	``	is	starting	an	enterprise	and	creating	value	,	and	taking	something	from	beginning	to	end	.
so	that	's	why	vcs	love	to	fund	serial	entrepreneurs	.
because	even	if	you	did	n't	do	it	right	the	first	time	,	you	've	learned	the	lessons	,	which	are	going	to	stand	you	in	very	good	stead	the	next	time	.
and	now	along	with	that	,	along	with	the	experience	of	starting	an	enterprise	,	or	running	something	--	and	it	does	n't	have	to	be	a	business	.
it	can	be	in	an	organization	at	school	,	it	can	be	a	not	-	for	-	profit	.
but	they	want	experience	in	creating	an	organization	.
next	up	is	knowledge	.
if	you	're	telling	me	you	're	going	to	be	the	great	developer	of	the	map	of	the	human	genome	,	you	'd	better	know	what	a	human	genome	is	.
i	mean	,	i	want	you	to	have	domain	expertise	.
so	i	do	n't	want	somebody	who	's	saying	,	``	hey	,	i	've	got	a	great	idea	in	a	business	i	know	nothing	about	.
i	do	n't	know	who	the	players	are	.
i	do	n't	know	what	the	market	is	like	.	``
so	you	've	got	to	know	your	market	.
you	've	got	to	know	your	area	.
and	then	you	have	to	have	the	skills	that	it	takes	to	get	a	company	going	.
and	those	skills	include	everything	from	technical	skills	,	if	it	's	a	technology	business	,	to	marketing	,	and	sales	,	and	management	,	and	so	on	.
but	,	you	know	,	not	everybody	has	all	these	skills	.
there	are	very	few	people	who	have	the	full	set	of	skills	that	it	takes	to	run	a	company	.
so	what	else	do	you	require	?
well	,	leadership	.
you	've	got	to	be	able	to	convince	us	that	you	either	have	developed	a	team	that	has	all	those	factors	in	it	,	or	else	you	can	.
and	you	have	the	charisma	and	the	management	style	and	the	ability	to	get	people	to	follow	your	lead	,	to	inspire	them	,	to	motivate	them	to	be	part	of	your	team	.
all	right	,	then	,	having	done	all	that	,	what	else	do	i	want	to	know	as	a	vc	?
i	want	to	know	that	you	have	commitment	.
that	you	are	going	to	be	here	to	the	end	.
i	want	you	to	say	,	or	i	want	you	to	convey	,	that	you	are	going	to	die	if	you	have	to	,	with	your	very	last	breath	,	with	your	fingernails	scratching	as	they	drag	you	out	.
you	're	going	to	keep	my	money	alive	and	you	're	going	to	make	more	money	out	of	it	.
so	i	do	n't	want	somebody	who	's	going	to	cut	and	run	at	the	first	opportunity	.
because	bad	things	happen	.
there	's	never	been	an	angel	-	or	a	venture	-	funded	company	where	bad	things	did	n't	happen	.
so	i	want	to	know	that	you	're	committed	to	be	there	to	the	very	end	.
you	've	got	to	have	vision	.
you	've	got	to	be	able	to	see	where	this	is	going	.
i	do	n't	want	another	``	me	too	``	product	.
i	want	somebody	who	knows	,	who	can	change	the	world	out	there	.
but	on	top	of	that	,	i	also	need	realism	.
because	i	need	to	know	that	you	know	that	while	changing	the	world	is	great	,	it	does	n't	always	happen	.
and	before	you	get	to	change	the	world	,	bad	things	are	going	to	take	place	.
and	you	've	got	to	be	able	to	deal	with	that	.
and	you	have	to	have	rational	projections	and	stuff	.
and	then	finally	,	you	're	asking	for	my	money	,	not	just	because	it	's	my	money	,	but	because	it	's	me	.
you	need	to	be	coachable	.
so	i	need	to	know	that	you	have	the	ability	to	listen	.
we	've	had	a	lot	of	experience	.
people	who	are	vcs	or	angels	investing	in	you	have	had	experience	and	they	'd	like	to	know	that	you	want	to	hear	that	experience	.
okay	,	so	how	do	you	convey	all	these	10	things	in	10	minutes	without	saying	any	more	?
you	ca	n't	say	,	``	hey	,	i	've	got	high	integrity	,	invest	in	me	!	``	right	?
you	've	got	to	do	a	whole	pitch	that	conveys	this	without	conveying	it	.
so	think	about	your	pitch	as	a	timeline	.
it	starts	off	,	you	walk	in	the	door	.
they	know	nothing	at	all	,	whatsoever	,	about	you	.
and	you	can	take	them	on	an	emotional	--	all	pitches	,	or	all	sales	presentations	,	are	emotional	at	some	level	.
you	can	go	up	,	you	can	go	down	,	right	?
and	it	goes	from	beginning	to	end	.
you	walk	in	the	door	.	so	the	first	thing	you	've	got	to	do	--	the	overall	,	you	know	,	arc	of	your	presentation	--	it	's	got	to	start	like	a	rocket	.
you	've	got	maybe	10	seconds	--	between	10	and	30	seconds	,	depending	on	how	long	the	pitch	is	--	to	get	their	attention	.
in	my	case	,	``	i	've	invested	.	i	have	got	tens	of	millions	of	dollars	from	powerpoint	pitches	.
i	have	invested	tens	of	millions	of	dollars	.	``
that	's	it	--	that	should	get	you	right	there	.
this	can	be	a	factor	,	and	everybody	can	be	saying	it	's	counterintuitive	.	it	can	be	a	story	,	it	can	be	experience	.
but	you	've	got	to	grab	their	emotional	attention	,	focused	on	you	,	within	that	first	few	seconds	.
and	then	from	there	,	you	've	got	to	take	them	on	a	very	solid	,	steady	,	upward	path	,	right	from	beginning	to	end	.
and	everything	has	got	to	be	reinforcing	this	.
and	you	've	got	to	get	better	,	and	better	,	and	better	,	and	better	.
and	it	's	revving	up	to	the	very	end	,	and	then	at	the	very	end	you	've	got	to	--	boom	!	--	knock	them	out	of	the	park	.
you	want	to	be	able	to	get	them	to	such	an	emotional	high	that	they	are	ready	to	write	you	a	check	,	throw	money	at	you	,	right	there	before	you	leave	.
okay	,	so	how	do	you	do	that	?
well	,	first	of	all	,	logical	progression	.
any	time	you	go	backwards	,	any	time	you	skip	a	step	--	imagine	walking	up	a	staircase	where	some	of	the	treads	are	missing	,	or	the	heights	are	different	heights	.
you	stop	,	you	've	got	to	figure	it	out	.
you	want	a	nice	logical	progression	.
start	with	telling	them	what	the	market	is	.
why	are	you	going	to	do	x	,	y	or	z	.
and	then	you	've	got	to	tell	me	how	you	're	going	to	do	it	,	and	what	it	is	you	're	going	to	do	.	how	you	're	going	to	do	it	.
and	the	whole	--	it	's	got	to	flow	from	beginning	to	end	.
you	've	also	got	to	let	me	know	that	there	are	touchstones	.
you	want	to	tie	in	to	the	rest	of	the	world	out	there	.
so	,	for	example	,	if	you	reference	companies	i	've	heard	of	,	or	basic	items	in	your	business	,	i	want	to	know	about	them	.	things	that	i	can	relate	to	:	validators	,	or	anything	that	tells	me	somebody	else	has	approved	this	,	or	there	's	outside	validation	.
it	can	be	sales	;	it	can	be	you	've	got	an	award	for	something	;	it	can	be	,	people	have	done	it	before	;	it	can	be	your	beta	tests	are	going	great	.
whatever	.	i	want	to	know	validation	,	that	you	're	telling	me	not	just	what	you	're	telling	me	,	but	that	somebody	else	--	or	something	else	out	there	--	says	this	makes	sense	.
and	then	,	because	i	'm	looking	for	the	upside	here	,	i	've	got	to	have	believable	upside	.
and	that	's	two	parts	.
it	's	got	to	be	upside	,	and	it	's	got	to	be	believable	.
the	upside	means	that	if	you	're	telling	me	that	you	're	going	to	be	out	there	,	five	years	out	,	making	a	million	dollars	a	year	--	hmm	.	that	's	not	really	upside	.
telling	me	you	're	going	to	be	out	there	making	a	billion	dollars	a	year	--	that	's	not	believable	.
so	it	's	got	to	be	both	sides	.
on	the	other	hand	,	there	are	a	lot	of	things	that	drive	me	down	,	take	the	emotional	level	down	,	and	you	've	got	to	recover	from	those	.
and	those	,	for	example	,	are	anything	you	tell	me	that	i	know	is	not	true	.
``	we	have	no	competition	.	there	's	nobody	else	who	's	ever	made	a	widget	like	this	.	``
odds	are	i	probably	know	somebody	who	has	made	a	widget	.
and	the	minute	you	tell	me	that	--	boom	!	you	know	,	i	discount	half	of	what	you	're	saying	from	then	on	.
anything	that	makes	me	think	.	anything	that	i	do	n't	understand	,	where	i	have	to	make	the	leap	myself	,	in	my	own	head	,	is	going	to	stop	the	flow	of	the	presentation	.
so	,	you	've	got	to	take	me	through	like	a	sixth	grader	--	dub	,	dub	,	dub	,	dub	,	dub	--	but	without	patronizing	me	.
and	it	's	a	very	tricky	path	to	do	it	.
but	if	you	can	do	it	,	it	works	really	,	really	well	.
anything	that	's	inconsistent	within	the	concept	of	your	thing	.
if	you	tell	me	sales	of	x	,	y	or	z	are	10	million	dollars	,	and	the	next	slide	,	or	five	slides	later	,	they	're	five	million	dollars	.
well	,	one	may	have	been	gross	sales	,	one	may	have	been	net	sales	,	but	i	want	to	know	that	all	the	numbers	make	sense	together	.
and	then	finally	,	anything	that	's	an	error	,	or	a	typo	,	or	a	stupid	mistake	,	or	a	line	that	's	in	the	wrong	place	.
that	shows	me	that	--	if	you	ca	n't	even	do	a	presentation	,	how	the	heck	can	you	run	a	company	?
so	this	all	feeds	in	together	.
all	right	,	so	the	best	way	to	do	this	stuff	is	to	look	at	our	betters	,	look	at	people	who	have	done	this	before	.
so	let	's	look	at	the	most	successful	technology	executive	in	the	business	and	see	how	a	presentation	goes	.
bill	gates	'	powerpoint	presentation	over	here	.
here	's	gates	doing	a	thing	for	windows	.
is	this	the	way	you	should	do	a	powerpoint	presentation	?
what	do	you	think	?
no	.	who	do	you	think	we	should	look	at	as	our	role	model	?
oh	,	is	n't	that	funny	!	there	's	another	great	one	over	here	.
yes	?	ok	,	steve	jobs	.
you	want	absolute	--	this	is	the	zen	of	presentation	,	right	?
here	he	is	.	one	little	guy	,	black	jeans	and	stuff	,	on	a	totally	empty	stage	.
what	are	you	focusing	on	?
you	're	focusing	on	him	!	this	is	steve	jobs	.
so	,	you	know	,	our	great	--	these	wonderful	long	bullet	points	,	a	whole	list	of	things	,	you	know	--	good	!
no	,	they	're	not	.
the	long	bullet	points	are	bad	.
what	's	good	?	short	,	short	bullet	points	.
but	you	know	what	?
even	better	than	short	bullet	points	are	no	bullet	points	.
just	give	me	the	headline	over	here	.
and	you	know	what	?
how	many	bullet	points	or	headlines	does	steve	jobs	use	?
basically	none	.
what	do	you	do	?
best	of	all	,	images	.	just	a	simple	image	.
i	looked	at	the	image	--	a	picture	's	worth	a	thousand	words	.
you	look	at	the	image	and	you	see	that	,	and	you	drop	the	whole	thing	.
and	then	,	you	come	back	to	me	.
and	you	're	focused	on	me	and	why	i	'm	such	a	great	guy	,	and	why	you	want	to	invest	in	me	.
and	why	this	whole	thing	makes	sense	.
so	with	that	said	,	we	only	have	a	very	,	very	short	time	.
so	let	's	run	through	the	things	you	've	got	to	include	in	your	presentation	.
well	,	first	of	all	,	start	out	.	none	of	these	big	,	long	-	titled	slides	with	blah	,	blah	,	blah	,	blah	,	blah	,	blah	and	i	'm	presenting	to	so	-	and	-	so	,	such	-	and	-	such	a	date	.
i	know	the	day	,	i	know	who	i	am	,	i	know	you	're	presenting	.
i	do	n't	need	all	that	.
just	give	me	your	company	logo	.
i	look	at	the	logo	,	and	it	sort	of	ties	it	to	my	brain	.
and	then	i	come	back	to	you	.	i	'm	focused	on	you	,	ok	?
you	do	that	,	you	give	me	your	quick	15	-	second	or	30	-	second	intro	,	grab	my	attention	.
and	then	you	want	to	give	me	a	quick	business	overview	.
this	is	not	a	five	-	minute	pitch	.	this	is	,	you	know	,	two	sentences	.
``	we	build	widgets	for	the	x	,	y	,	z	market	.	``
or	,	``	we	sell	services	to	help	somebody	do	x.	``	you	know	,	whatever	.
and	that	is	like	the	picture	on	the	outside	of	a	jigsaw	puzzle	box	.
that	lets	me	know	the	context	.
it	gives	me	the	armature	for	the	whole	thing	you	're	going	to	be	going	through	.
and	it	lets	me	put	everything	else	in	relation	to	something	you	've	already	told	me	.
so	there	you	go	--	walk	me	through	,	show	me	who	your	management	team	is	.
it	's	helpful	that	you	've	had	experience	and	you	've	done	this	kind	of	thing	before	.
and	i	want	to	know	the	market	--	the	size	of	the	market	.
why	is	this	market	worth	getting	at	over	here	?
i	want	to	know	your	product	,	and	that	's	very	important	.
now	,	this	is	not	a	product	pitch	,	not	a	sales	pitch	.
i	do	n't	want	to	know	all	the	ins	and	outs	,	and	the	gazuntas	and	the	yaddas	and	stuff	.
i	just	want	to	know	--	what	the	heck	is	it	?
if	it	's	a	website	,	show	me	a	screenshot	of	your	website	.
you	know	,	do	n't	do	a	live	demo	.
no	,	never	do	a	live	demo	.
do	a	canned	demo	,	or	do	something	that	lets	me	know	why	people	are	going	to	buy	whatever	it	is	.
then	i	want	to	know	--	now	that	i	know	what	you	're	selling	,	tell	me	how	you	make	money	on	it	.
for	every	x	you	sell	,	you	get	y	,	you	do	your	services	of	z	.
i	want	to	know	what	the	business	model	is	on	a	sort	of	per	-	unit	basis	,	or	for	the	actual	product	that	you	're	selling	.
i	want	to	know	who	you	're	selling	this	thing	to	,	in	terms	of	customers	.
and	i	want	to	know	if	you	have	any	relationships	that	are	going	to	be	special	to	help	you	.
whether	you	have	a	distribution	relationship	with	somebody	,	you	know	,	you	have	a	producing	partner	.	or	,	you	know	,	again	,	validation	.
this	helps	to	say	you	're	bigger	than	just	one	little	thing	over	here	.
but	then	,	everybody	has	competition	.
there	has	never	been	a	company	that	does	n't	have	competition	.
even	if	the	competition	is	the	old	way	of	doing	something	.
i	want	to	know	exactly	what	your	competition	is	,	and	then	that	will	help	me	judge	how	you	fit	into	the	whole	operation	over	here	.
but	then	,	i	want	to	know	how	you	're	special	.
if	i	know	what	your	competition	does	,	how	are	you	going	to	prevent	your	competition	from	eating	your	lunch	over	here	?
and	then	all	this	ties	into	the	financial	overview	.
and	you	have	to	have	--	you	ca	n't	do	a	vc	pitch	without	giving	me	your	financials	.
i	want	to	know	three	and	,	you	know	,	a	year	or	two	back	,	or	as	long	as	you	've	been	in	existence	.
and	i	want	to	know	three	or	four	or	five	years	forward	.
five	is	a	bit	much	.	probably	four	is	rational	.
and	i	want	to	know	how	that	business	model	that	you	showed	me	on	a	product	basis	is	going	to	translate	into	a	company	model	.
and	,	you	know	,	how	many	widgets	are	you	going	to	sell	?
you	're	making	x	amount	per	widget	.
i	want	to	know	what	the	driver	is	.
we	're	going	to	have	1,000	customers	this	year	,	and	10,000	next	year	.
and	our	revenues	are	going	to	go	this	,	that	and	the	other	thing	.
and	so	that	gives	me	the	whole	picture	for	the	next	several	years	into	which	i	'm	investing	.
and	i	want	to	know	how	the	money	you	're	going	to	get	from	me	is	going	to	help	you	get	there	.
you	're	going	to	open	an	offshore	plant	in	china	,	you	're	going	to	spend	it	all	on	sales	and	marketing	,	you	're	going	to	go	to	tahiti	,	or	whatever	out	there	.
but	then	comes	the	ask	.
this	is	where	you	tell	me	how	much	you	actually	want	to	get	.
you	're	looking	for	5	million	--	at	what	kind	of	valuation	?
two	million	at	100,000	.
what	's	the	money	in	so	far	?	who	invested	?
i	hope	you	invested	personally	.
because	i	'm	following	on	.
if	you	ca	n't	invest	in	your	own	thing	,	why	should	i	invest	in	it	?
so	i	like	to	know	if	you	have	friends	and	family	,	or	angel	investors	in	there	,	or	you	've	had	more	vcs	before	.
what	's	the	capital	structure	up	until	this	point	?
and	then	finally	,	having	done	all	that	,	you	've	now	told	me	the	whole	thing	,	so	now	you	've	got	to	bring	it	back	to	that	conclusion	.
this	is	that	rocket	going	up	.
so	hopefully	everything	has	been	positive	,	positive	,	positive	,	more	positive	.
and	everything	,	everything	you	say	clicks	with	me	,	and	it	all	makes	sense	.
and	i	'm	thinking	,	``	this	is	really	,	really	great	.	``
and	then	you	take	me	back	to	your	logo	.
just	your	logo	on	the	screen	.
and	i	look	at	the	logo	--	okay	,	good	.
now	i	come	back	to	you	.	nothing	else	to	look	at	,	right	?
and	now	,	you	've	got	to	wrap	it	up	and	tie	it	up	here	.
you	've	got	to	give	me	the	final	,	you	know	--	boom	!	--	the	final	pitch	that	's	going	to	send	me	into	space	.
now	,	in	the	process	of	doing	this	over	here	,	how	do	you	remember	the	sequences	and	doers	?
you	've	noticed	here	that	i	'm	not	looking	at	the	screen	,	right	?
the	screen	is	,	actually	,	in	this	room	,	is	set	up	so	it	's	in	front	of	me	.
so	,	i	could	n't	even	see	if	i	wanted	to	.
so	now	,	how	do	i	know	what	's	going	on	here	?
well	,	i	've	got	a	laptop	in	front	of	me	,	but	you	're	looking	at	me	.	and	you	're	looking	at	this	.
what	do	you	think	i	'm	looking	at	?
you	think	that	i	'm	looking	at	that	?
no	,	i	'm	looking	actually	at	a	special	version	of	powerpoint	over	here	,	which	shows	me	the	slides	ahead	,	the	slides	behind	,	my	notes	from	here	,	so	i	can	see	what	's	going	on	.
powerpoint	has	this	built	into	every	copy	of	powerpoint	that	's	shipped	.
if	you	use	apple	's	keynote	,	it	's	got	an	even	better	version	in	keynote	.
and	then	there	's	another	program	,	called	ovation	,	you	can	get	from	adobe	,	that	they	just	bought	last	summer	.
which	actually	helps	you	run	the	whole	timers	,	and	it	lets	you	figure	out	what	's	going	on	.
so	,	here	's	my	wrap	up	to	take	you	to	the	moon	,	right	?
david	's	--	i	usually	do	a	top	10	,	we	do	n't	have	time	for	top	10s	.
so	david	's	top	five	presentation	tips	.
number	one	:	always	use	presenter	mode	,	or	ovation	,	or	presenter	tools	,	because	it	lets	you	know	exactly	where	you	're	going	.
it	helps	you	pace	yourself	,	it	gives	you	a	timer	so	we	end	on	time	and	the	whole	bit	.
number	four	:	always	use	remote	control	.
have	you	seen	me	touch	the	computer	?
no	,	you	have	n't	.	why	not	?
because	i	'm	using	remote	control	over	here	.
always	use	remote	control	.
number	three	:	the	handouts	you	give	are	not	your	presentation	.
if	you	follow	my	suggestions	,	you	're	going	to	have	a	very	spare	,	very	zen	-	like	presentation	,	which	is	great	for	conveying	who	you	are	and	getting	people	emotionally	involved	.
but	it	's	not	really	good	as	a	handout	.
you	want	to	have	a	handout	that	gives	a	lot	more	information	,	because	the	handout	has	to	stand	without	you	over	here	.
number	three	:	do	n't	read	your	speech	.
can	you	imagine	?	``	well	,	you	should	invest	in	my	company	because	it	's	really	good	.	``
it	does	n't	work	,	right	?	do	n't	read	your	speech	.
and	the	number	one	presentation	tip	:	never	,	ever	look	at	the	screen	.
you	're	making	a	connection	with	your	audience	over	here	,	and	you	always	want	to	do	a	one	-	on	-	one	connection	.
the	screen	should	come	up	visually	behind	you	,	and	supplement	what	you	're	doing	instead	of	replace	you	.
and	that	is	how	to	pitch	to	a	vc	.
