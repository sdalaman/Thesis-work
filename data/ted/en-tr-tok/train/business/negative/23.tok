i	love	trees	,	and	i	'm	very	lucky	,	because	we	live	near	a	wonderful	arboretum	,	and	sundays	,	usually	,	i	'd	go	there	with	my	wife	and	now	,	with	my	four	-	year	-	old	,	and	we	'd	climb	in	the	trees	,	we	'd	play	hide	and	seek	.
the	second	school	i	was	at	had	big	trees	too	,	had	a	fantastic	tulip	tree	,	i	think	it	was	the	biggest	in	the	country	,	and	it	also	had	a	lot	of	wonderful	bushes	and	vegetation	around	it	,	around	the	playing	fields	.
one	day	i	was	grabbed	by	some	of	my	classmates	,	and	taken	in	the	bushes	--	i	was	stripped	;	i	was	attacked	;	i	was	abused	;	and	this	came	out	of	the	blue	.
now	,	the	reason	i	say	that	,	because	,	afterwards	,	i	was	thinking	--	well	,	i	went	back	into	the	school	--	i	felt	dirty	;	i	felt	betrayed	;	i	felt	ashamed	,	but	mainly	--	mainly	,	i	felt	powerless	.
and	30	years	later	i	was	sitting	in	an	airplane	,	next	to	a	lady	called	veronica	,	who	came	from	chile	,	and	we	were	on	a	human	rights	tour	,	and	she	was	starting	to	tell	me	what	it	was	like	to	be	tortured	,	and	,	from	my	very	privileged	position	,	this	was	the	only	reference	point	that	i	had	.
and	it	was	an	amazing	learning	experience	because	,	for	me	,	human	rights	have	been	something	in	which	i	had	,	you	know	,	a	part	-	time	interest	,	but	,	mainly	,	it	was	something	that	happened	to	other	people	over	there	.
but	i	got	a	phone	call	from	bono	in	1985	and	,	as	you	know	,	he	's	a	great	singer	,	but	he	's	a	magnificent	hustler	,	and	--	--	a	very	hard	guy	to	say	no	to	,	and	he	was	saying	,	you	know	,	just	after	i	'd	done	the	biko	song	,	we	're	going	to	do	a	tour	for	amnesty	,	you	have	to	be	on	it	,	and	really	that	was	the	first	time	that	i	'd	been	out	and	started	meeting	people	who	'd	watched	their	family	being	shot	in	front	of	them	,	who	'd	had	a	partner	thrown	out	of	an	airplane	into	an	ocean	,	and	suddenly	this	world	of	human	rights	arrived	in	my	world	,	and	i	could	n't	really	walk	away	in	quite	the	same	way	as	before	.
so	i	got	involved	with	this	tour	,	which	was	for	amnesty	,	and	then	in	'88	i	took	over	bono	's	job	trying	to	learn	how	to	hustle	.
i	did	n't	do	it	as	well	,	but	we	managed	to	get	youssou	n'dour	,	sting	,	tracy	chapman	,	and	bruce	springsteen	to	go	'	round	the	world	for	amnesty	,	and	it	was	an	amazing	experience	.
and	,	once	again	,	i	got	an	extraordinary	education	,	and	it	was	the	first	time	,	really	,	that	i	'd	met	a	lot	of	these	people	in	the	different	countries	,	and	these	human	rights	stories	became	very	physical	,	and	,	again	,	i	could	n't	really	walk	away	quite	so	comfortably	.
but	the	thing	that	really	amazed	me	,	that	i	had	no	idea	,	was	that	you	could	suffer	in	this	way	and	then	have	your	whole	experience	,	your	story	,	denied	,	buried	and	forgotten	.
and	it	seemed	that	whenever	there	was	a	camera	around	,	or	a	video	or	film	camera	,	it	was	a	great	deal	harder	to	do	--	for	those	in	power	to	bury	the	story	.
and	reebok	set	up	a	foundation	after	these	human	rights	now	tours	and	there	was	a	decision	then	--	well	,	we	made	a	proposal	,	for	a	couple	of	years	,	about	trying	to	set	up	a	division	that	was	going	to	give	cameras	to	human	rights	activists	.
it	did	n't	really	get	anywhere	,	and	then	the	rodney	king	incident	happened	,	and	people	thought	,	ok	,	if	you	have	a	camera	in	the	right	place	at	the	right	time	,	or	,	perhaps	,	the	wrong	time	,	depending	who	you	are	,	then	you	can	actually	start	doing	something	,	and	campaigning	,	and	being	heard	,	and	telling	people	about	what	's	going	on	.
so	,	witness	was	started	in	'92	and	it	's	since	given	cameras	out	in	over	60	countries	.
and	we	campaign	with	activist	groups	and	help	them	tell	their	story	and	,	in	fact	,	i	will	show	you	in	a	moment	one	of	the	most	recent	campaigns	,	and	i	'm	afraid	it	's	a	story	from	uganda	,	and	,	although	we	had	a	wonderful	story	from	uganda	yesterday	,	this	one	is	n't	quite	so	good	.
in	the	north	of	uganda	,	there	are	something	like	1.5	million	internally	displaced	people	,	people	who	are	not	refugees	in	another	country	,	but	because	of	the	civil	war	,	which	has	been	going	on	for	about	20	years	,	they	have	nowhere	to	live	.
and	20,000	kids	have	been	taken	away	to	become	child	soldiers	,	and	the	international	criminal	court	is	going	after	five	of	the	leaders	of	the	--	now	,	what	's	it	called	?
i	forget	the	name	of	the	of	the	army	--	it	's	lord	's	resistance	army	,	i	believe	--	but	the	government	,	also	,	does	n't	have	a	clean	sheet	,	so	if	we	could	run	the	first	video	.
woman	:	life	in	the	camp	is	never	simple	.	even	today	life	is	difficult	.
we	stay	because	of	the	fear	that	what	pushed	us	into	the	camp	...
still	exists	back	home	.
text	:	``	between	two	fires	:	torture	and	displacement	in	northern	uganda	``	man	:	when	we	were	at	home	,	it	was	kony	's	[	rebel	]	soldiers	disturbing	us	.
at	first	,	we	were	safe	in	the	camp	.
but	later	the	government	soldiers	began	mistreating	us	a	lot	.
jennifer	:	a	soldier	walked	onto	the	road	,	asking	where	we	'd	been	.
evelyn	and	i	hid	behind	my	mother	.
evelyn	:	he	ordered	us	to	sit	down	,	so	we	sat	down	.
the	other	soldier	also	came	.
jennifer	:	the	man	came	and	started	undressing	me	.
the	other	one	carried	evelyn	aside	.
the	one	who	was	defiling	me	then	left	me	and	went	to	rape	evelyn	.
and	the	one	who	was	raping	evelyn	came	and	defiled	me	also	.
man	:	the	soldiers	with	clubs	this	long	beat	us	to	get	a	confession	.
they	kept	telling	us	,	``	tell	the	truth	!	``	as	they	beat	us	.
woman	:	they	insisted	that	i	was	lying	.
at	that	moment	,	they	fired	and	shot	off	my	fingers	.
i	fell	.	they	ran	to	join	the	others	...	leaving	me	for	dead	.
text	:	uganda	ratified	the	convention	against	torture	in	1986	.
torture	is	defined	as	any	act	by	which	severe	pain	of	suffering	,	whether	physical	or	mental	,	is	intentionally	inflicted	by	a	person	acting	in	an	official	capacity	to	obtain	information	or	a	confession	,	to	punish	,	coerce	or	intimidate	.
peter	gabriel	:	so	torture	is	not	something	that	always	happens	on	other	soil	.
in	my	country	,	it	was	--	we	had	been	looking	at	pictures	of	british	soldiers	beating	up	young	iraqis	;	we	've	got	abu	ghraib	;	we	've	got	guantanamo	bay	.
i	had	a	driver	on	my	way	to	newark	airport	,	and	he	told	me	a	story	that	,	in	the	middle	of	the	night	,	4	a.m.	,	he	'd	been	taken	out	of	his	home	in	queens	--	taken	to	a	place	in	the	midwest	,	that	he	was	interrogated	and	tortured	and	returned	to	the	street	four	weeks	later	,	because	he	had	the	same	--	he	was	middle	eastern	,	and	he	had	the	same	name	as	one	of	the	9/11	pilots	,	and	that	may	or	may	not	be	true	--	i	did	n't	think	he	was	a	liar	,	though	.
and	,	i	think	,	if	we	look	around	the	world	,	as	well	as	the	polar	ice	caps	melting	,	human	rights	,	which	have	been	fought	for	,	for	many	hundreds	of	years	in	some	cases	,	are	,	also	,	eroding	very	fast	,	and	that	is	something	that	we	need	to	take	a	look	at	and	,	maybe	,	start	campaigning	for	.
i	mean	,	here	,	too	,	one	of	our	partners	was	at	van	jones	and	the	books	not	bars	project	--	they	have	managed	,	with	their	footage	in	california	to	change	the	youth	correction	systems	employed	,	and	it	's	much	--	much	--	i	think	,	more	humane	methods	are	being	looked	at	,	how	you	should	lock	up	young	kids	,	and	that	's	questionable	to	start	off	.
and	as	the	story	of	mr.	morales	,	just	down	the	road	,	excuse	me	,	mr.	gabriel	,	would	you	mind	if	we	delayed	your	execution	a	little	bit	?
no	,	not	at	all	,	no	problem	,	take	your	time	.
but	this	,	surely	,	whoever	that	man	is	,	whatever	he	's	done	,	this	is	cruel	and	unusual	punishment	.
anyway	,	witness	has	been	trying	to	arm	the	brave	people	who	often	put	their	lives	at	risk	around	the	world	,	with	cameras	,	and	i	'd	like	to	show	you	just	a	little	more	of	that	.	thank	you	.
text	:	you	can	say	a	story	is	fabricated	.
text	:	you	can	say	a	jury	is	corrupt	.
you	can	say	a	person	is	lying	.
you	can	say	you	do	n't	trust	newspapers	.
but	you	ca	n't	say	what	you	just	saw	never	happened	.
help	witness	give	cameras	to	the	world	.
shoot	a	video	;	expose	injustice	;	reveal	the	truth	;	show	us	what	's	wrong	with	the	world	;	and	maybe	we	can	help	make	it	right	.
witness	.
all	the	video	you	have	just	seen	was	recorded	by	human	rights	groups	working	with	witness	.
pg	:	witness	was	born	of	technological	innovation	--	in	a	sense	the	small	,	portable	,	dv	cam	was	really	what	allowed	it	to	come	into	being	.
and	we	've	also	been	trying	to	get	computers	out	to	the	world	,	so	that	groups	can	communicate	much	more	effectively	,	campaign	much	more	effectively	,	but	now	we	have	the	wonderful	possibility	,	which	is	given	to	us	from	the	mobile	phone	with	the	camera	in	it	,	because	that	is	cheap	;	it	's	ubiquitous	;	and	it	's	moving	fast	all	around	the	world	--	and	it	's	very	exciting	for	us	.
and	so	,	the	dream	is	that	we	could	have	a	world	in	which	anyone	who	has	anything	bad	happen	to	them	of	this	sort	has	a	chance	of	getting	their	story	uploaded	,	being	seen	,	being	watched	,	that	they	really	know	that	they	can	be	heard	,	that	there	would	be	a	giant	website	,	maybe	,	a	little	like	google	earth	,	and	you	could	fly	over	and	find	out	the	realities	of	what	's	going	,	for	the	world	's	inhabitants	.	in	a	way	what	this	technology	is	allowing	is	,	really	,	that	a	lot	of	the	problems	of	the	world	can	have	a	human	face	,	that	we	can	actually	see	who	's	dying	of	aids	or	who	's	being	beaten	up	,	for	the	first	time	,	and	we	can	hear	their	stories	in	a	way	that	the	blogger	culture	--	if	we	can	move	that	into	these	sort	of	fields	,	i	think	we	can	really	transform	the	world	in	all	sorts	of	ways	.
there	could	be	a	new	movement	growing	up	,	rising	from	the	ground	,	reaching	for	the	light	,	and	growing	strong	,	just	like	a	tree	.	thank	you	.
