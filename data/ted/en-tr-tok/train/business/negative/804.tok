i	want	to	talk	about	4.6	billion	years	of	history	in	18	minutes	.
that	's	300	million	years	per	minute	.
let	's	start	with	the	first	photograph	nasa	obtained	of	planet	mars	.
this	is	fly	-	by	,	mariner	iv	.
it	was	taken	in	1965	.
when	this	picture	appeared	,	that	well	-	known	scientific	journal	,	the	new	york	times	,	wrote	in	its	editorial	,	``	mars	is	uninteresting	.
it	's	a	dead	world	.	nasa	should	not	spend	any	time	or	effort	studying	mars	anymore	.	``
fortunately	,	our	leaders	in	washington	at	nasa	headquarters	knew	better	and	we	began	a	very	extensive	study	of	the	red	planet	.
one	of	the	key	questions	in	all	of	science	,	``	is	there	life	outside	of	earth	?	``
i	believe	that	mars	is	the	most	likely	target	for	life	outside	the	earth	.
i	'm	going	to	show	you	in	a	few	minutes	some	amazing	measurements	that	suggest	there	may	be	life	on	mars	.
but	let	me	start	with	a	viking	photograph	.
this	is	a	composite	taken	by	viking	in	1976	.
viking	was	developed	and	managed	at	the	nasa	langley	research	center	.
we	sent	two	orbiters	and	two	landers	in	the	summer	of	1976	.
we	had	four	spacecraft	,	two	around	mars	,	two	on	the	surface	--	an	amazing	accomplishment	.
this	is	the	first	photograph	taken	from	the	surface	of	any	planet	.
this	is	a	viking	lander	photograph	of	the	surface	of	mars	.
and	yes	,	the	red	planet	is	red	.
mars	is	half	the	size	of	the	earth	,	but	because	two	-	thirds	of	the	earth	is	covered	by	water	,	the	land	area	on	mars	is	comparable	to	the	land	area	on	earth	.
so	,	mars	is	a	pretty	big	place	even	though	it	's	half	the	size	.
we	have	obtained	topographic	measurements	of	the	surface	of	mars	.	we	understand	the	elevation	differences	.
we	know	a	lot	about	mars	.
mars	has	the	largest	volcano	in	the	solar	system	,	olympus	mons	.
mars	has	the	grand	canyon	of	the	solar	system	,	valles	marineris	.
very	,	very	interesting	planet	.
mars	has	the	largest	impact	crater	in	the	solar	system	,	hellas	basin	.
this	is	2,000	miles	across	.
if	you	happened	to	be	on	mars	when	this	impactor	hit	,	it	was	a	really	bad	day	on	mars	.
this	is	olympus	mons	.
this	is	bigger	than	the	state	of	arizona	.
volcanoes	are	important	,	because	volcanoes	produce	atmospheres	and	they	produce	oceans	.
we	're	looking	at	valles	marineris	,	the	largest	canyon	in	the	solar	system	,	superimposed	on	a	map	of	the	united	states	,	3,000	miles	across	.
one	of	the	most	intriguing	features	about	mars	,	the	national	academy	of	science	says	one	of	the	10	major	mysteries	of	the	space	age	,	is	why	certain	areas	of	mars	are	so	highly	magnetized	.
we	call	this	crustal	magnetism	.
there	are	regions	on	mars	,	where	,	for	some	reason	--	we	do	n't	understand	why	at	this	point	--	the	surface	is	very	,	very	highly	magnetized	.
is	there	water	on	mars	?
the	answer	is	no	,	there	is	no	liquid	water	on	the	surface	of	mars	today	.
but	there	is	intriguing	evidence	that	suggests	that	the	early	history	of	mars	there	may	have	been	rivers	and	fast	flowing	water	.
today	mars	is	very	very	dry	.
we	believe	there	's	some	water	in	the	polar	caps	,	there	are	polar	caps	of	north	pole	and	south	pole	.
here	are	some	recent	images	.
this	is	from	spirit	and	opportunity	.
these	images	that	show	at	one	time	,	there	was	very	fast	flowing	water	on	the	surface	of	mars	.
why	is	water	important	?	water	is	important	because	if	you	want	life	you	have	to	have	water	.
water	is	the	key	ingredient	in	the	evolution	,	the	origin	of	life	on	a	planet	.
here	is	some	picture	of	antarctica	and	a	picture	of	olympus	mons	,	very	similar	features	,	glaciers	.
so	,	this	is	frozen	water	.
this	is	ice	water	on	mars	.
this	is	my	favorite	picture	.	this	was	just	taken	a	few	weeks	ago	.
it	has	not	been	seen	publicly	.
this	is	european	space	agency	mars	express	,	image	of	a	crater	on	mars	and	in	the	middle	of	the	crater	we	have	liquid	water	,	we	have	ice	.
very	intriguing	photograph	.
we	now	believe	that	in	the	early	history	of	mars	,	which	is	4.6	billion	years	ago	,	4.6	billion	years	ago	,	mars	was	very	earth	-	like	.
mars	had	rivers	,	mars	had	lakes	,	but	more	important	mars	had	planetary	-	scale	oceans	.
we	believe	that	the	oceans	were	in	the	northern	hemisphere	,	and	this	area	in	blue	,	which	shows	a	depression	of	about	four	miles	,	was	the	ancient	ocean	area	on	the	surface	of	mars	.
where	did	the	ocean	's	worth	of	water	on	mars	go	?
well	,	we	have	an	idea	.
this	is	a	measurement	we	obtained	a	few	years	ago	from	a	mars	-	orbiting	satellite	called	odyssey	.
sub	-	surface	water	on	mars	,	frozen	in	the	form	of	ice	.
and	this	shows	the	percent	.	if	it	's	a	blueish	color	,	it	means	16	percent	by	weight	.
sixteen	percent	,	by	weight	,	of	the	interior	contains	frozen	water	,	or	ice	.
so	,	there	is	a	lot	of	water	below	the	surface	.
the	most	intriguing	and	puzzling	measurement	,	in	my	opinion	,	we	've	obtained	of	mars	,	was	released	earlier	this	year	in	the	magazine	science	.
and	what	we	're	looking	at	is	the	presence	of	the	gas	methane	,	ch	4	,	in	the	atmosphere	of	mars	.
and	you	can	see	there	are	three	distinct	regions	of	methane	.
why	is	methane	important	?
because	on	earth	,	almost	all	--	99.9	percent	--	of	the	methane	is	produced	by	living	systems	,	not	little	green	men	,	but	microscopic	life	below	the	surface	or	at	the	surface	.
we	now	have	evidence	that	methane	is	in	the	atmosphere	of	mars	,	a	gas	that	,	on	earth	,	is	biogenic	in	origin	,	produced	by	living	systems	.
these	are	the	three	plumes	:	a	,	b	1	,	b	2	.
and	this	is	the	terrain	it	appears	over	,	and	we	know	from	geological	studies	that	these	regions	are	the	oldest	regions	on	mars	.
in	fact	,	the	earth	and	mars	are	both	4.6	billion	years	old	.
the	oldest	rock	on	earth	is	only	3.6	billion	.
the	reason	there	is	a	billion	-	year	gap	in	our	geological	understanding	is	because	of	plate	tectonics	,	the	crust	of	the	earth	has	been	recycled	.
we	have	no	geological	record	prior	for	the	first	billion	years	.
that	record	exists	on	mars	.
and	this	terrain	that	we	're	looking	at	dates	back	to	4.6	billion	years	when	earth	and	mars	were	formed	.
it	was	a	tuesday	.
this	is	a	map	that	shows	where	we	've	put	our	spacecraft	on	the	surface	of	mars	.
here	is	viking	i	,	viking	ii	.
this	is	opportunity	.	this	is	spirit	.
this	is	mars	pathfinder	.	this	is	phoenix	,	we	just	put	two	years	ago	.
notice	all	of	our	rovers	and	all	of	our	landers	have	gone	to	the	northern	hemisphere	.
that	's	because	the	northern	hemisphere	is	the	region	of	the	ancient	ocean	basin	.
there	are	n't	many	craters	.
and	that	's	because	the	water	protected	the	basin	from	being	impacted	by	asteroids	and	meteorites	.
but	look	in	the	southern	hemisphere	.
in	the	southern	hemisphere	there	are	impact	craters	,	there	are	volcanic	craters	.
here	's	hellas	basin	,	a	very	very	different	place	,	geologically	.
look	where	the	methane	is	,	the	methane	is	in	a	very	rough	terrain	area	.
what	is	the	best	way	to	unravel	the	mysteries	on	mars	that	exist	?
we	asked	this	question	10	years	ago	.
we	invited	10	of	the	top	mars	scientists	to	the	langley	research	center	for	two	days	.
we	addressed	on	the	board	the	major	questions	that	have	not	been	answered	.
and	we	spent	two	days	deciding	how	to	best	answer	this	question	.
and	the	result	of	our	meeting	was	a	robotic	rocket	-	powered	airplane	we	call	ares	.
it	's	an	aerial	regional	-	scale	environmental	surveyor	.
there	's	a	model	of	ares	here	.
this	is	a	20	-	percent	scale	model	.
this	airplane	was	designed	at	the	langley	research	center	.
if	any	place	in	the	world	can	build	an	airplane	to	fly	on	mars	,	it	's	the	langley	research	center	,	for	almost	100	years	a	leading	center	of	aeronautics	in	the	world	.
we	fly	about	a	mile	above	the	surface	.
we	cover	hundreds	of	miles	,	and	we	fly	about	450	miles	an	hour	.
we	can	do	things	that	rovers	ca	n't	do	and	landers	ca	n't	do	:	we	can	fly	above	mountains	,	volcanoes	,	impact	craters	;	we	fly	over	valleys	;	we	can	fly	over	surface	magnetism	,	the	polar	caps	,	subsurface	water	;	and	we	can	search	for	life	on	mars	.
but	,	of	equal	importance	,	as	we	fly	through	the	atmosphere	of	mars	,	we	transmit	that	journey	,	the	first	flight	of	an	airplane	outside	of	the	earth	,	we	transmit	those	images	back	to	earth	.
and	our	goal	is	to	inspire	the	american	public	who	is	paying	for	this	mission	through	tax	dollars	.
but	more	important	we	will	inspire	the	next	generation	of	scientists	,	technologists	,	engineers	and	mathematicians	.
and	that	's	a	critical	area	of	national	security	and	economic	vitality	,	to	make	sure	we	produce	the	next	generation	of	scientists	,	engineers	,	mathematicians	and	technologists	.
this	is	what	ares	looks	like	as	it	flies	over	mars	.
we	preprogram	it	.
we	will	fly	where	the	methane	is	.
we	will	have	instruments	aboard	the	plane	that	will	sample	,	every	three	minutes	,	the	atmosphere	of	mars	.
we	will	look	for	methane	as	well	as	other	gasses	produced	by	living	systems	.
we	will	pinpoint	where	these	gases	emanate	from	,	because	we	can	measure	the	gradient	where	it	comes	from	,	and	there	,	we	can	direct	the	next	mission	to	land	right	in	that	area	.
how	do	we	transport	an	airplane	to	mars	?
in	two	words	,	very	carefully	.
the	problem	is	we	do	n't	fly	it	to	mars	,	we	put	it	in	a	spacecraft	and	we	send	it	to	mars	.
the	problem	is	the	spacecraft	's	largest	diameter	is	nine	feet	;	ares	is	21	-	foot	wingspan	,	17	feet	long	.
how	do	we	get	it	to	mars	?
we	fold	it	,	and	we	transport	it	in	a	spacecraft	.
and	we	have	it	in	something	called	an	aeroshell	.
this	is	how	we	do	it	.
and	we	have	a	little	video	that	describes	the	sequence	.
video	:	seven	,	six	.	green	board	.	five	,	four	,	three	,	two	,	one	.
main	engine	start	,	and	liftoff	.
joel	levine	:	this	is	a	launch	from	the	kennedy	space	center	in	florida	.
this	is	the	spacecraft	taking	nine	months	to	get	to	mars	.
it	enters	the	atmosphere	of	mars	.
a	lot	of	heating	,	frictional	heating	.	it	's	going	18	thousand	miles	an	hour	.
a	parachute	opens	up	to	slow	it	down	.
the	thermal	tiles	fall	off	.
the	airplane	is	exposed	to	the	atmosphere	for	the	first	time	.
it	unfolds	.
the	rocket	engine	begins	.
we	believe	that	in	a	one	-	hour	flight	we	can	rewrite	the	textbook	on	mars	by	making	high	-	resolution	measurements	of	the	atmosphere	,	looking	for	gases	of	biogenic	origin	,	looking	for	gases	of	volcanic	origin	,	studying	the	surface	,	studying	the	magnetism	on	the	surface	,	which	we	do	n't	understand	,	as	well	as	about	a	dozen	other	areas	.
practice	makes	perfect	.
how	do	we	know	we	can	do	it	?
because	we	have	tested	ares	model	,	several	models	in	a	half	a	dozen	wind	tunnels	at	the	nasa	langley	research	center	for	eight	years	,	under	mars	conditions	.
and	,	of	equal	importance	is	,	we	test	ares	in	the	earth	's	atmosphere	,	at	100,000	feet	,	which	is	comparable	to	the	density	and	pressure	of	the	atmosphere	on	mars	where	we	'll	fly	.
now	,	100,000	feet	,	if	you	fly	cross	-	country	to	los	angeles	,	you	fly	37,000	feet	.
we	do	our	tests	at	100,000	feet	.
and	i	want	to	show	you	one	of	our	tests	.
this	is	a	half	-	scale	model	.
this	is	a	high	-	altitude	helium	balloon	.
this	is	over	tilamook	,	oregon	.
we	put	the	folded	airplane	on	the	balloon	--	it	took	about	three	hours	to	get	up	there	--	and	then	we	released	it	on	command	at	103,000	feet	,	and	we	deploy	the	airplane	and	everything	works	perfectly	.
and	we	've	done	high	-	altitude	and	low	-	altitude	tests	,	just	to	perfect	this	technique	.
we	're	ready	to	go	.
i	have	a	scale	model	here	.
but	we	have	a	full	-	scale	model	in	storage	at	the	nasa	langley	research	center	.
we	're	ready	to	go	.	all	we	need	is	a	check	from	nasa	headquarters	to	cover	the	costs	.
i	'm	prepared	to	donate	my	honorarium	for	today	's	talk	for	this	mission	.
there	's	actually	no	honorarium	for	anyone	for	this	thing	.
this	is	the	ares	team	;	we	have	about	150	scientists	,	engineers	;	where	we	're	working	with	jet	propulsion	laboratory	,	goddard	space	flight	center	,	ames	research	center	and	half	a	dozen	major	universities	and	corporations	in	developing	this	.
it	's	a	large	effort	.	it	's	all	at	nasa	langley	research	center	.
and	let	me	conclude	by	saying	not	too	far	from	here	,	right	down	the	road	in	kittyhawk	,	north	carolina	,	a	little	more	than	100	years	ago	when	we	had	the	first	powered	flight	of	an	airplane	on	earth	.
we	are	on	the	verge	right	now	to	make	the	first	flight	of	an	airplane	outside	the	earth	's	atmosphere	.
we	are	prepared	to	fly	this	on	mars	,	rewrite	the	textbook	about	mars	.
if	you	're	interested	in	more	information	,	we	have	a	website	that	describes	this	exciting	and	intriguing	mission	,	and	why	we	want	to	do	it	.
thank	you	very	much	.
