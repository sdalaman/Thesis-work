my	name	is	emiliano	salinas	and	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	the	role	we	members	of	society	play	in	the	violent	atmosphere	this	country	is	living	in	right	now	.
i	was	born	in	1976	.
i	grew	up	in	a	traditional	mexican	family	.
as	a	child	,	i	had	a	pretty	normal	life	:	i	would	go	to	school	,	play	with	my	friends	and	cousins	.
but	then	my	father	became	president	of	mexico	and	my	life	changed	.
what	i	'm	about	to	say	,	at	least	some	of	what	i	'm	about	to	say	,	will	cause	controversy	.
firstly	,	because	i	'm	the	one	who	's	going	to	say	it	.
and	secondly	,	because	what	i	'm	going	to	say	is	true	,	and	it	will	make	a	lot	of	people	nervous	because	it	's	something	we	do	n't	want	to	hear	.
but	it	's	imperative	that	we	listen	because	it	's	undeniable	and	definitive	.
it	will	also	make	members	of	criminal	organizations	nervous	for	the	same	reasons	.
i	'm	going	to	talk	about	the	role	we	members	of	society	play	in	this	phenomenon	,	and	about	four	different	response	levels	we	citizens	have	against	violence	.
i	know	many	will	find	it	difficult	to	separate	the	fact	that	i	'm	carlos	salinas	de	gortari	's	son	from	the	fact	that	i	'm	a	citizen	concerned	about	the	country	's	current	situation	.
do	n't	worry	.
it	's	not	necessary	for	understanding	the	importance	of	what	i	'm	going	to	say	.
i	think	we	have	a	problem	in	mexico	.
we	have	a	big	problem	.
i	think	there	's	consensus	on	this	.
no	one	argues	--	we	all	agree	there	's	a	problem	.
what	we	do	n't	agree	on	is	what	the	problem	actually	is	.
is	it	the	zetas	?	the	drug	traffickers	?	the	government	?
corruption	?	poverty	?	or	is	it	something	else	?
i	think	none	of	these	is	the	problem	.
i	do	n't	mean	they	do	n't	deserve	attention	.
but	we	wo	n't	be	able	to	take	care	of	any	of	those	things	if	we	do	n't	solve	the	real	problem	we	have	in	mexico	first	.
the	real	problem	we	have	is	most	of	us	mexicans	,	we	believe	we	are	victims	of	our	circumstances	.
we	are	a	country	of	victims	.
historically	,	we	've	always	acted	as	victims	of	something	or	somebody	.
we	were	victims	of	the	spaniards	.
then	we	were	victims	of	the	french	.
then	we	were	victims	of	don	porfirio	.
then	we	were	victims	of	the	pri	.
even	of	salinas	.
and	of	el	peje	.
and	now	of	the	zetas	and	the	traffickers	and	the	criminals	and	the	kidnappers	...
hold	on	!	wait	a	minute	!
what	if	none	of	these	things	is	the	problem	?
the	problem	is	not	the	things	we	feel	victims	of	.
the	problem	is	that	we	play	the	role	of	victims	.
we	need	to	open	our	eyes	and	see	that	we	are	not	victims	.
if	only	we	stopped	feeling	like	victims	,	if	we	stopped	acting	as	victims	,	our	country	would	change	so	much	!
i	'm	going	to	talk	about	how	to	go	from	a	society	that	acts	as	a	victim	of	circumstances	to	a	responsible	,	involved	society	that	takes	the	future	of	its	country	in	its	own	hands	.
i	'm	going	to	talk	about	four	different	levels	of	civil	response	against	violence	,	from	weakest	to	strongest	.
the	first	level	,	the	weakest	level	of	civil	response	against	violence	,	is	denial	and	apathy	.
today	,	much	of	mexican	society	is	in	denial	of	the	situation	we	're	going	through	.
we	want	to	go	on	with	our	daily	life	even	though	we	are	not	living	under	normal	circumstances	.
daily	life	in	our	country	is	,	to	say	the	least	,	under	extraordinary	,	exceptional	circumstances	.
it	's	like	someone	who	has	a	serious	illness	and	pretends	it	's	the	flu	and	it	will	just	go	away	.
we	want	to	pretend	that	mexico	has	the	flu	.
but	it	does	n't	.
mexico	has	cancer	.
and	if	we	do	n't	do	something	about	it	,	the	cancer	will	end	up	killing	it	.
we	need	to	move	mexican	society	from	denial	and	apathy	to	the	next	level	of	citizen	response	,	which	is	,	effectively	,	recognition	.
and	that	recognition	will	sow	fear	--	recognizing	the	seriousness	of	the	situation	.
but	,	fear	is	better	than	apathy	because	fear	makes	us	do	something	.
many	people	in	mexico	are	afraid	today	.
we	're	very	afraid	.
and	we	're	acting	out	of	that	fear	.
and	let	me	tell	you	what	the	problem	is	with	acting	out	of	fear	--	and	this	is	the	second	level	of	civil	response	:	fear	.
let	's	think	about	mexican	streets	:	they	're	unsafe	because	of	violence	,	so	people	stay	at	home	.
does	that	make	streets	more	or	less	safe	?
so	streets	become	more	desolate	and	unsafe	,	so	we	stay	home	more	--	which	makes	streets	even	more	desolate	and	unsafe	,	and	we	stay	home	even	more	.
this	vicious	circle	ends	up	with	the	whole	population	stuck	inside	their	houses	,	scared	to	death	--	even	more	afraid	than	when	we	were	out	on	the	streets	.
we	need	to	confront	this	fear	.
we	need	to	move	mexican	society	,	the	members	of	society	who	are	at	this	level	,	to	the	next	level	,	which	is	action	.
we	need	to	face	our	fears	and	take	back	our	streets	,	our	cities	,	our	neighborhoods	.
for	many	people	,	acting	involves	rage	.
we	go	from	fear	to	rage	.
they	say	,	``	i	ca	n't	take	it	anymore	.
let	's	do	something	about	it	.	``
recently	--	this	is	a	sensitive	figure	--	35	public	lynchings	have	been	recorded	so	far	in	2010	in	mexico	.
usually	it	's	one	or	two	a	year	.
now	we	're	experiencing	one	every	week	.
this	shows	that	society	is	desperate	and	it	's	taking	the	law	into	its	own	hands	.
unfortunately	,	violent	action	--	though	action	is	better	than	no	action	--	but	taking	part	in	it	only	disguises	violence	.
if	i	'm	violent	with	you	and	you	respond	with	violence	,	you	become	part	of	the	violence	and	you	just	disguise	my	violence	.
so	civil	action	is	vital	,	but	it	's	also	vital	to	take	people	who	are	at	the	level	of	rage	and	violent	action	to	the	next	level	,	which	is	non	-	violent	action	.
it	's	pacific	,	coordinated	civil	action	,	which	does	n't	mean	passive	action	.
it	means	it	's	determined	and	effective	,	but	not	violent	.
there	are	examples	of	this	kind	of	action	in	mexico	.
two	years	ago	,	in	galena	city	,	chihuahua	,	a	member	of	the	community	was	kidnapped	,	eric	le	barón	.
his	brothers	,	benjamín	and	julián	,	got	together	with	the	rest	of	the	community	to	think	of	the	best	course	of	action	:	to	pay	the	ransom	,	to	take	up	arms	and	go	after	the	kidnappers	or	to	ask	the	government	for	help	.
in	the	end	,	benjamín	and	julián	decided	the	best	thing	they	could	do	was	to	organize	the	community	and	act	together	.
so	what	did	they	do	?
they	mobilized	the	whole	community	of	le	barón	to	go	to	chihuahua	,	where	they	organized	a	sit	-	in	in	the	central	park	of	the	city	.
they	sent	a	message	to	the	kidnappers	:	``	if	you	want	your	ransom	come	and	get	it	.
we	'll	be	waiting	for	you	right	here	.	``
they	stayed	there	.
seven	days	later	,	eric	was	set	free	and	was	able	to	return	home	.
this	is	an	example	of	what	an	organized	society	can	do	,	a	society	that	acts	.
of	course	,	criminals	can	respond	.
and	in	this	case	,	they	did	.
on	july	7th	,	2009	,	benjamín	le	barón	was	murdered	.
but	julián	le	barón	keeps	working	and	he	has	been	mobilizing	communities	in	chihuahua	for	over	a	year	.
and	for	over	a	year	he	has	known	that	a	price	has	been	put	on	his	head	.
but	he	keeps	fighting	.
he	keeps	organizing	.
he	keeps	mobilizing	.
these	heroic	acts	are	present	all	over	the	country	.
with	a	thousand	juliáns	working	together	,	mexico	would	be	a	very	different	country	.
and	they	're	out	there	!
they	just	have	to	raise	their	hands	.
i	was	born	in	mexico	,	i	grew	up	in	mexico	and	along	the	way	,	i	learned	to	love	mexico	.
i	think	anyone	who	has	stepped	foot	on	this	land	--	not	to	mention	all	mexican	people	--	will	agree	that	it	's	not	difficult	to	love	mexico	.
i	've	traveled	a	lot	and	nowhere	else	have	i	found	the	passion	mexicans	have	.
that	devotion	we	feel	for	the	national	football	team	.
that	devotion	we	show	in	helping	victims	of	disasters	,	such	as	the	earthquake	in	1985	or	this	year	's	floods	.
the	passion	with	which	we	've	been	singing	the	national	anthem	since	we	were	kids	.
when	we	thought	masiosare	was	the	strange	enemy	,	and	we	sang	,	with	a	childlike	heart	,	``	a	soldier	in	each	son	.	``
i	think	the	biggest	insult	,	the	worst	way	you	can	offend	a	mexican	is	to	insult	their	mother	.
a	mother	is	the	most	sacred	thing	in	life	.
mexico	is	our	mother	and	today	she	cries	out	for	her	children	.
we	are	going	through	the	darkest	moment	in	our	recent	history	.
our	mother	,	mexico	,	is	being	violated	before	our	very	eyes	.
what	are	we	going	to	do	?
masiosare	,	the	strange	enemy	,	is	here	.
where	is	the	soldier	in	each	son	?
mahatma	gandhi	,	one	of	the	greatest	civil	fighters	of	all	time	,	said	,	``	be	the	change	you	wish	to	see	in	the	world	.	``
today	in	mexico	we	're	asking	for	gandhis	.
we	need	ghandis	.
we	need	men	and	women	who	love	mexico	and	who	are	willing	to	take	action	.
this	is	a	call	for	every	true	mexican	to	join	this	initiative	.
this	is	a	call	so	that	every	single	thing	we	love	about	mexico	--	the	festivals	,	the	markets	,	the	restaurants	,	the	cantinas	,	the	tequila	,	the	mariachis	,	the	serenades	,	the	posadas	,	el	grito	,	the	day	of	the	dead	,	san	miguel	,	the	joy	,	the	passion	for	life	,	the	fight	and	everything	it	means	to	be	mexican	--	does	n't	disappear	from	this	world	.
we	're	facing	a	very	powerful	opponent	.
but	we	are	many	more	.
they	can	take	a	man	's	life	.
anyone	can	kill	me	,	or	you	,	or	you	.
but	no	one	can	kill	the	spirit	of	true	mexicans	.
the	battle	is	won	,	but	we	still	have	to	fight	it	.
2000	years	ago	,	the	roman	poet	juvenal	said	something	that	today	echoes	in	the	heart	of	every	true	mexican	.
he	said	,	``	count	it	the	greatest	sin	to	prefer	life	to	honor	,	and	for	the	sake	of	living	to	lose	what	makes	life	worth	living	.	``
thank	you	.
