billy	collins	:	i	'm	here	to	give	you	your	recommended	dietary	allowance	and	the	way	i	'm	going	to	do	that	is	present	to	you	five	animations	of	five	of	my	poems	.
and	let	me	just	tell	you	a	little	bit	of	how	that	came	about	.
because	the	mixing	of	those	two	media	is	a	sort	of	unnatural	or	unnecessary	act	.
but	when	i	was	united	states	poet	laureate	--	and	i	love	saying	that	.
it	's	a	great	way	to	start	sentences	.
when	i	was	him	back	then	,	i	was	approached	by	j.	walter	thompson	,	the	ad	company	,	and	they	were	hired	sort	of	by	the	sundance	channel	.
and	the	idea	was	to	have	me	record	some	of	my	poems	and	then	they	would	find	animators	to	animate	them	.
and	i	was	initially	resistant	,	because	i	always	think	poetry	can	stand	alone	by	itself	.
attempts	to	put	my	poems	to	music	have	had	disastrous	results	,	in	all	cases	.
and	the	poem	,	if	it	's	written	with	the	ear	,	already	has	been	set	to	its	own	verbal	music	as	it	was	composed	.
and	surely	,	if	you	're	reading	a	poem	that	mentions	a	cow	,	you	do	n't	need	on	the	facing	page	a	drawing	of	a	cow	.
i	mean	,	let	's	let	the	reader	do	a	little	work	.
but	i	relented	because	it	seemed	like	an	interesting	possibility	,	and	also	i	'm	like	a	total	cartoon	junkie	since	childhood	.
i	think	more	influential	than	emily	dickinson	or	coleridge	or	wordsworth	on	my	imagination	were	warner	brothers	,	merrie	melodies	and	loony	tunes	cartoons	.
bugs	bunny	is	my	muse	.
and	this	way	poetry	could	find	its	way	onto	television	of	all	places	.
and	i	'm	pretty	much	all	for	poetry	in	public	places	--	poetry	on	buses	,	poetry	on	subways	,	on	billboards	,	on	cereal	boxes	.
when	i	was	poet	laureate	,	there	i	go	again	--	i	ca	n't	help	it	,	it	's	true	--	i	created	a	poetry	channel	on	delta	airlines	that	lasted	for	a	couple	of	years	.
so	you	could	tune	into	poetry	as	you	were	flying	.
and	my	sense	is	,	it	's	a	good	thing	to	get	poetry	off	the	shelves	and	more	into	public	life	.
start	a	meeting	with	a	poem	.	that	would	be	an	idea	you	might	take	with	you	.
when	you	get	a	poem	on	a	billboard	or	on	the	radio	or	on	a	cereal	box	or	whatever	,	it	happens	to	you	so	suddenly	that	you	do	n't	have	time	to	deploy	your	anti	-	poetry	deflector	shields	that	were	installed	in	high	school	.
so	let	us	start	with	the	first	one	.
it	's	a	little	poem	called	``	budapest	,	``	and	in	it	i	reveal	,	or	pretend	to	reveal	,	the	secrets	of	the	creative	process	.
narration	:	``	budapest	.	``
my	pen	moves	along	the	page	like	the	snout	of	a	strange	animal	shaped	like	a	human	arm	and	dressed	in	the	sleeve	of	a	loose	green	sweater	.
i	watch	it	sniffing	the	paper	ceaselessly	,	intent	as	any	forager	that	has	nothing	on	its	mind	but	the	grubs	and	insects	that	will	allow	it	to	live	another	day	.
it	wants	only	to	be	here	tomorrow	,	dressed	perhaps	in	the	sleeve	of	a	plaid	shirt	,	nose	pressed	against	the	page	,	writing	a	few	more	dutiful	lines	while	i	gaze	out	the	window	and	imagine	budapest	or	some	other	city	where	i	have	never	been	.
bc	:	so	that	makes	it	seem	a	little	easier	.
writing	is	not	actually	as	easy	as	that	for	me	.
but	i	like	to	pretend	that	it	comes	with	ease	.
one	of	my	students	came	up	after	class	,	an	introductory	class	,	and	she	said	,	``	you	know	,	poetry	is	harder	than	writing	,	``	which	i	found	both	erroneous	and	profound	.
so	i	like	to	at	least	pretend	it	just	flows	out	.
a	friend	of	mine	has	a	slogan	;	he	's	another	poet	.
he	says	that	,	``	if	at	first	you	do	n't	succeed	,	hide	all	evidence	you	ever	tried	.	``
the	next	poem	is	also	rather	short	.
poetry	just	says	a	few	things	in	different	ways	.
and	i	think	you	could	boil	this	poem	down	to	saying	,	``	some	days	you	eat	the	bear	,	other	days	the	bear	eats	you	.	``
and	it	uses	the	imagery	of	dollhouse	furniture	.
narration	:	``	some	days	.	``
some	days	i	put	the	people	in	their	places	at	the	table	,	bend	their	legs	at	the	knees	,	if	they	come	with	that	feature	,	and	fix	them	into	the	tiny	wooden	chairs	.
all	afternoon	they	face	one	another	,	the	man	in	the	brown	suit	,	the	woman	in	the	blue	dress	--	perfectly	motionless	,	perfectly	behaved	.
but	other	days	i	am	the	one	who	is	lifted	up	by	the	ribs	then	lowered	into	the	dining	room	of	a	dollhouse	to	sit	with	the	others	at	the	long	table	.
very	funny	.
but	how	would	you	like	it	if	you	never	knew	from	one	day	to	the	next	if	you	were	going	to	spend	it	striding	around	like	a	vivid	god	,	your	shoulders	in	the	clouds	,	or	sitting	down	there	amidst	the	wallpaper	staring	straight	ahead	with	your	little	plastic	face	?
bc	:	there	's	a	horror	movie	in	there	somewhere	.
the	next	poem	is	called	forgetfulness	,	and	it	's	really	just	a	kind	of	poetic	essay	on	the	subject	of	mental	slippage	.
and	the	poem	begins	with	a	certain	species	of	forgetfulness	that	someone	called	literary	amnesia	,	in	other	words	,	forgetting	the	things	that	you	have	read	.
narration	:	``	forgetfulness	.	``
the	name	of	the	author	is	the	first	to	go	,	by	the	title	,	the	plot	,	the	heartbreaking	conclusion	,	the	entire	novel	,	which	suddenly	becomes	one	you	have	never	read	,	never	even	heard	of	.
it	is	as	if	,	one	by	one	,	the	memories	you	used	to	harbor	decided	to	retire	to	the	southern	hemisphere	of	the	brain	to	a	little	fishing	village	where	there	are	no	phones	.
long	ago	,	you	kissed	the	names	of	the	nine	muses	good	-	bye	and	you	watched	the	quadratic	equation	pack	its	bag	.
and	even	now	,	as	you	memorize	the	order	of	the	planets	,	something	else	is	slipping	away	,	a	state	flower	perhaps	,	the	address	of	an	uncle	,	the	capital	of	paraguay	.
whatever	it	is	you	are	struggling	to	remember	,	it	is	not	poised	on	the	tip	of	your	tongue	,	not	even	lurking	in	some	obscure	corner	of	your	spleen	.
it	has	floated	away	down	a	dark	mythological	river	whose	name	begins	with	an	l	as	far	as	you	can	recall	,	well	on	your	own	way	to	oblivion	where	you	will	join	those	who	have	forgotten	even	how	to	swim	and	how	to	ride	a	bicycle	.
no	wonder	you	rise	in	the	middle	of	the	night	to	look	up	the	date	of	a	famous	battle	in	a	book	on	war	.
no	wonder	the	moon	in	the	window	seems	to	have	drifted	out	of	a	love	poem	that	you	used	to	know	by	heart	.
bc	:	the	next	poem	is	called	``	the	country	``	and	it	's	based	on	,	when	i	was	in	college	i	met	a	classmate	who	remains	to	be	a	friend	of	mine	.
he	lived	,	and	still	does	,	in	rural	vermont	.
i	lived	in	new	york	city	.
and	we	would	visit	each	other	.
and	when	i	would	go	up	to	the	country	,	he	would	teach	me	things	like	deer	hunting	,	which	meant	getting	lost	with	a	gun	basically	--	and	trout	fishing	and	stuff	like	that	.
and	then	he	'd	come	down	to	new	york	city	and	i	'd	teach	him	what	i	knew	,	which	was	largely	smoking	and	drinking	.
and	in	that	way	we	traded	lore	with	each	other	.
the	poem	that	's	coming	up	is	based	on	him	trying	to	tell	me	a	little	something	about	a	domestic	point	of	etiquette	in	country	living	that	i	had	a	very	hard	time	,	at	first	,	processing	.
it	's	called	``	the	country	.	``
narration	:	``	the	country	.	``
i	wondered	about	you	when	you	told	me	never	to	leave	a	box	of	wooden	strike	-	anywhere	matches	just	lying	around	the	house	,	because	the	mice	might	get	into	them	and	start	a	fire	.
but	your	face	was	absolutely	straight	when	you	twisted	the	lid	down	on	the	round	tin	where	the	matches	,	you	said	,	are	always	stowed	.
who	could	sleep	that	night	?
who	could	whisk	away	the	thought	of	the	one	unlikely	mouse	padding	along	a	cold	water	pipe	behind	the	floral	wallpaper	,	gripping	a	single	wooden	match	between	the	needles	of	his	teeth	?
who	could	not	see	him	rounding	a	corner	,	the	blue	tip	scratching	against	rough	-	hewn	beam	,	the	sudden	flare	and	the	creature	,	for	one	bright	,	shining	moment	,	suddenly	thrust	ahead	of	his	time	--	now	a	fire	-	starter	,	now	a	torch	-	bearer	in	a	forgotten	ritual	,	little	brown	druid	illuminating	some	ancient	night	?
and	who	could	fail	to	notice	,	lit	up	in	the	blazing	insulation	,	the	tiny	looks	of	wonderment	on	the	faces	of	his	fellow	mice	--	one	-	time	inhabitants	of	what	once	was	your	house	in	the	country	?
bc	:	thank	you	.
thank	you	.	and	the	last	poem	is	called	``	the	dead	.	``
i	wrote	this	after	a	friend	's	funeral	,	but	not	so	much	about	the	friend	as	something	the	eulogist	kept	saying	,	as	all	eulogists	tend	to	do	,	which	is	how	happy	the	deceased	would	be	to	look	down	and	see	all	of	us	assembled	.
and	that	to	me	was	a	bad	start	to	the	afterlife	,	having	to	witness	your	own	funeral	and	feel	gratified	.
so	the	little	poem	is	called	``	the	dead	.	``
narration	:	``	the	dead	.	``
the	dead	are	always	looking	down	on	us	,	they	say	.
while	we	are	putting	on	our	shoes	or	making	a	sandwich	,	they	are	looking	down	through	the	glass	-	bottom	boats	of	heaven	as	they	row	themselves	slowly	through	eternity	.
they	watch	the	tops	of	our	heads	moving	below	on	earth	.
and	when	we	lie	down	in	a	field	or	on	a	couch	,	drugged	perhaps	by	the	hum	of	a	warm	afternoon	,	they	think	we	are	looking	back	at	them	,	which	makes	them	lift	their	oars	and	fall	silent	and	wait	like	parents	for	us	to	close	our	eyes	.
bc	:	i	'm	not	sure	if	other	poems	will	be	animated	.
it	took	a	long	time	--	i	mean	,	it	's	rather	uncommon	to	have	this	marriage	--	a	long	time	to	put	those	two	together	.
but	then	again	,	it	took	us	a	long	time	to	put	the	wheel	and	the	suitcase	together	.
i	mean	,	we	had	the	wheel	for	some	time	.
and	schlepping	is	an	ancient	and	honorable	art	.
i	just	have	time	to	read	a	more	recent	poem	to	you	.
if	it	has	a	subject	,	the	subject	is	adolescence	.
and	it	's	addressed	to	a	certain	person	.
it	's	called	``	to	my	favorite	17	-	year	-	old	high	school	girl	.	``
``	do	you	realize	that	if	you	had	started	building	the	parthenon	on	the	day	you	were	born	,	you	would	be	all	done	in	only	one	more	year	?
of	course	,	you	could	n't	have	done	that	all	alone	.
so	never	mind	;	you	're	fine	just	being	yourself	.
you	're	loved	for	just	being	you	.
but	did	you	know	that	at	your	age	judy	garland	was	pulling	down	150,000	dollars	a	picture	,	joan	of	arc	was	leading	the	french	army	to	victory	and	blaise	pascal	had	cleaned	up	his	room	--	no	wait	,	i	mean	he	had	invented	the	calculator	?
of	course	,	there	will	be	time	for	all	that	later	in	your	life	,	after	you	come	out	of	your	room	and	begin	to	blossom	,	or	at	least	pick	up	all	your	socks	.
for	some	reason	i	keep	remembering	that	lady	jane	grey	was	queen	of	england	when	she	was	only	15	.
but	then	she	was	beheaded	,	so	never	mind	her	as	a	role	model	.
a	few	centuries	later	,	when	he	was	your	age	,	franz	schubert	was	doing	the	dishes	for	his	family	,	but	that	did	not	keep	him	from	composing	two	symphonies	,	four	operas	and	two	complete	masses	as	a	youngster	.
but	of	course	,	that	was	in	austria	at	the	height	of	romantic	lyricism	,	not	here	in	the	suburbs	of	cleveland	.
frankly	,	who	cares	if	annie	oakley	was	a	crack	shot	at	15	or	if	maria	callas	debuted	as	tosca	at	17	?
we	think	you	're	special	just	being	you	--	playing	with	your	food	and	staring	into	space	.
by	the	way	,	i	lied	about	schubert	doing	the	dishes	,	but	that	does	n't	mean	he	never	helped	out	around	the	house	.	``
thank	you	.	thank	you	.
thanks	.
