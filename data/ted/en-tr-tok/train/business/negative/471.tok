this	is	the	first	of	two	rather	extraordinary	photographs	i	'm	going	to	show	you	today	.
it	was	taken	18	years	ago	.
i	was	19	years	old	at	the	time	.
i	had	just	returned	from	one	of	the	deepest	dives	i	'd	ever	made	at	that	time	,	--	a	little	over	200	feet	--	and	,	i	had	caught	this	little	fish	here	.
it	turns	out	that	that	particular	one	was	the	first	live	one	of	that	ever	taken	alive	.
i	'm	not	just	an	ichthyologist	,	i	'm	a	bona	fide	fish	nerd	.
and	to	a	fish	nerd	,	this	is	some	pretty	exciting	stuff	.
and	more	exciting	was	the	fact	that	the	person	who	took	this	photo	was	a	guy	named	jack	randall	,	the	greatest	living	ichthyologist	on	earth	,	the	grand	poobah	of	fish	nerds	,	if	you	will	.
and	so	,	it	was	really	exciting	to	me	to	have	this	moment	in	time	,	it	really	set	the	course	for	the	rest	of	my	life	.
but	really	the	most	significant	thing	,	the	most	profound	thing	about	this	picture	is	that	it	was	taken	two	days	before	i	was	completely	paralyzed	from	the	neck	down	.
i	made	a	really	stupid	kind	of	mistake	that	most	19	-	year	-	old	males	do	when	they	think	they	're	immortal	,	and	i	got	a	bad	case	of	the	bends	,	and	was	paralyzed	,	and	had	to	be	flown	back	for	treatment	.
i	learned	two	really	important	things	that	day	.
the	first	thing	i	learned	--	well	,	i	'm	mortal	,	that	's	a	really	big	one	.
and	the	second	thing	i	learned	was	that	i	knew	,	with	profound	certainty	,	that	this	is	exactly	what	i	was	going	to	do	for	the	rest	of	my	life	.
i	had	to	focus	all	my	energies	towards	going	to	find	new	species	of	things	down	on	deep	coral	reefs	.
now	,	when	you	think	of	a	coral	reef	,	this	is	what	most	people	think	of	:	all	these	big	,	hard	,	elaborate	corals	and	lots	of	bright	,	colorful	fishes	and	things	.
but	,	this	is	really	just	the	tip	of	the	iceberg	.
if	you	look	at	this	diagram	of	a	coral	reef	,	we	know	a	lot	about	that	part	up	near	the	top	,	and	the	reason	we	know	so	much	about	it	is	scuba	divers	can	very	easily	go	down	there	and	access	it	.
there	is	a	problem	with	scuba	though	,	in	that	it	imposes	some	limitations	on	how	deep	you	can	go	,	and	it	turns	out	that	depth	is	about	200	feet	.
i	'll	get	into	why	that	is	in	just	a	minute	.
but	,	the	point	is	that	scuba	divers	generally	stay	less	than	100	feet	deep	,	and	very	rarely	go	much	below	this	,	at	least	,	not	with	any	kind	of	sanity	.
so	,	to	go	deeper	,	most	biologists	have	turned	to	submersibles	.
now	,	submersibles	are	great	,	wonderful	things	,	but	if	you	're	going	to	spend	30,000	dollars	a	day	to	use	one	of	these	things	,	and	it	's	capable	of	going	2,000	feet	,	you	're	sure	not	going	to	go	farting	around	up	here	in	a	couple	of	hundred	feet	,	you	're	going	to	go	way	,	way	,	way	,	down	deep	.
so	,	the	bottom	line	is	that	almost	all	research	using	submersibles	has	taken	place	well	below	500	feet	.
now	,	it	's	pretty	obvious	at	this	point	that	there	's	this	zone	here	in	the	middle	and	that	's	the	zone	that	really	centers	around	my	own	personal	pursuit	of	happiness	.
i	want	to	find	out	what	's	in	this	zone	.
we	know	almost	nothing	about	it	.
scuba	divers	ca	n't	get	there	,	submarines	go	right	on	past	it	.
it	took	me	a	year	to	learn	how	to	walk	again	after	i	had	my	diving	accident	in	palau	and	during	that	year	i	spent	a	lot	of	time	learning	about	the	physics	and	physiology	of	diving	and	figuring	out	how	to	overcome	these	limitations	.
so	,	i	'm	just	going	to	show	you	a	basic	idea	.
we	're	all	breathing	air	right	now	.	air	is	a	mixture	of	oxygen	and	nitrogen	,	about	20	percent	oxygen	.	about	80	percent	nitrogen	is	in	our	lungs	.
and	there	's	a	phenomenon	called	henry	's	law	that	says	that	gases	will	dissolve	into	a	fluid	in	proportion	to	the	partial	pressures	which	you	're	exposing	them	to	.
so	,	basically	the	gas	dissolves	into	our	body	.
the	oxygen	is	bound	by	metabolism	,	we	use	it	for	energy	.
the	nitrogen	just	sort	of	floats	around	in	our	blood	and	tissues	,	and	that	's	all	fine	,	that	's	how	we	're	designed	.
the	problem	happens	when	you	start	to	go	underwater	.
now	,	the	deeper	you	go	underwater	,	the	higher	the	pressure	is	.
if	you	were	to	go	down	to	a	depth	of	about	130	feet	,	which	is	the	recommended	limit	for	most	scuba	divers	,	you	get	this	pressure	effect	.
and	the	effect	of	that	pressure	is	that	you	have	an	increased	density	of	gas	molecules	in	every	breath	you	take	.
over	time	,	those	gas	molecules	dissolve	into	your	blood	and	tissues	and	start	to	fill	you	up	.
now	,	if	you	were	to	go	down	to	,	say	,	300	feet	,	you	do	n't	have	five	times	as	many	gas	molecules	in	your	lungs	--	you	've	got	10	times	as	many	gas	molecules	in	your	lungs	.
and	,	sure	enough	,	they	dissolve	into	your	blood	,	and	into	your	tissues	as	well	.
and	of	course	,	if	you	were	to	down	to	where	there	's	15	times	as	much	--	the	deeper	you	go	,	the	more	exacerbating	the	problem	becomes	.
and	the	problem	,	the	limitation	of	diving	with	air	is	all	those	dots	in	your	body	--	all	the	nitrogen	and	all	the	oxygen	.
there	're	three	basic	limitations	of	scuba	diving	.
the	first	limitation	is	the	oxygen	--	oxygen	toxicity	.
now	,	we	all	know	the	song	:	``	love	is	like	oxygen	.	/	you	get	too	much	,	you	get	too	high	.	/	not	enough	,	and	you	're	going	to	die	.	``
well	,	in	the	context	of	diving	,	you	get	too	much	,	you	die	also	.
you	die	also	because	oxygen	toxicity	can	cause	a	seizure	--	makes	you	convulse	underwater	,	not	a	good	thing	to	happen	underwater	.
it	happens	because	there	's	too	much	concentration	of	oxygen	in	your	body	.
the	nitrogen	has	two	problems	.
one	of	them	is	what	jacques	cousteau	called	``	rapture	of	the	deep	.	``
it	's	nitrogen	narcosis	.
it	makes	you	loopy	.
the	deeper	you	go	,	the	loopier	you	get	.
you	do	n't	want	to	drive	drunk	,	you	do	n't	want	to	dive	drunk	,	so	that	's	a	real	big	problem	.
and	of	course	,	the	third	problem	is	the	one	i	found	out	the	hard	way	in	palau	,	which	is	the	bends	.
now	the	one	thing	that	i	forgot	to	mention	,	is	that	to	obviate	the	problem	of	the	nitrogen	narcosis	--	all	of	those	blue	dots	in	our	body	--	you	remove	the	nitrogen	and	you	replace	it	with	helium	.
now	helium	's	a	gas	,	there	're	a	lot	of	reasons	why	helium	's	good	,	it	's	a	tiny	molecule	,	it	's	inert	,	it	does	n't	give	you	narcosis	.
so	that	's	the	basic	concept	that	we	use	.
but	,	the	theory	's	relatively	easy	.
the	tricky	part	is	the	implementation	.
so	,	this	is	how	i	began	,	about	15	years	ago	.
i	'll	admit	,	it	was	n't	exactly	the	smartest	of	starts	,	but	,	you	know	,	you	got	to	start	somewhere	.
at	the	time	,	i	was	n't	the	only	one	who	did	n't	know	what	i	was	doing	--	almost	nobody	did	.
and	this	rig	was	actually	used	for	a	dive	of	300	feet	.
over	time	we	got	a	little	bit	better	at	it	,	and	we	came	up	with	this	really	sophisticated	-	looking	rig	with	four	scuba	tanks	and	five	regulators	and	all	the	right	gas	mixtures	and	all	that	good	stuff	.
and	it	was	fine	and	dandy	,	and	it	allowed	us	to	go	down	and	find	new	species	.
this	picture	was	taken	300	feet	deep	,	catching	new	species	of	fish	.
but	,	the	problem	was	that	it	did	n't	allow	us	much	time	.
for	all	its	bulk	and	size	,	it	only	gave	us	about	15	minutes	at	most	down	at	those	sorts	of	depths	.
we	needed	more	time	.
there	had	to	be	a	better	way	.
and	,	indeed	,	there	is	a	better	way	.
in	1994	,	i	was	fortunate	enough	to	get	access	to	these	prototype	closed	-	circuit	rebreathers	.
alright	,	closed	-	circuit	rebreather	--	what	is	it	about	it	that	makes	it	different	from	scuba	,	and	why	is	it	better	?
well	,	there	are	three	main	advantages	to	a	rebreather	.
one	,	they	're	quiet	,	they	do	n't	make	any	noise	.
two	,	they	allow	you	to	stay	underwater	longer	.
three	,	they	allow	you	to	go	deeper	.
how	is	it	that	they	do	that	?
well	,	in	order	to	really	understand	how	they	do	that	you	have	to	take	off	the	hood	,	and	look	underneath	and	see	what	's	going	on	.
there	are	three	basic	systems	to	a	closed	-	circuit	rebreather	.
the	most	fundamental	of	these	is	called	the	breathing	loop	.
it	's	a	breathing	loop	because	you	breathe	off	of	it	,	and	it	's	a	closed	loop	,	and	you	breathe	the	same	gas	around	and	around	and	around	.
so	there	's	a	mouthpiece	that	you	put	in	your	mouth	,	and	there	's	also	a	counterlung	,	or	in	this	case	,	two	counterlungs	.
now	,	the	counterlungs	are	n't	high	-	tech	,	they	're	just	simply	flexible	bags	.
they	allow	you	to	mechanically	breathe	,	or	mechanically	ventilate	.
when	you	exhale	your	breath	,	it	goes	in	the	exhale	counterlung	:	when	you	inhale	a	breath	,	it	comes	from	the	inhale	counterlung	.
it	's	just	pure	mechanics	,	allowing	you	to	cycle	air	through	this	breathing	loop	.
and	,	the	other	component	on	a	breathing	loop	is	the	carbon	dioxide	absorbent	canister	.
now	,	as	we	breathe	,	we	produce	carbon	dioxide	,	and	that	carbon	dioxide	needs	to	be	scrubbed	out	of	the	system	.
there	's	a	chemical	filter	in	there	that	pulls	the	carbon	dioxide	out	of	the	breathing	gas	--	so	that	,	when	it	comes	back	to	us	to	breathe	again	,	it	's	safe	to	breathe	again	.
so	that	's	the	breathing	loop	in	a	nutshell	.
the	second	main	component	of	a	closed	-	circuit	rebreather	is	the	gas	system	.
the	primary	purpose	of	the	gas	system	is	to	provide	oxygen	,	to	replenish	the	oxygen	that	your	body	consumes	.
so	the	main	tank	,	the	main	critical	thing	,	is	this	oxygen	gas	supply	cylinder	we	have	here	.
but	,	if	we	only	had	an	oxygen	gas	supply	cylinder	we	would	n't	be	able	to	go	very	deep	,	because	we	'd	run	into	oxygen	toxicity	very	,	very	quickly	.
so	we	need	another	gas	,	something	to	dilute	the	oxygen	with	.
and	that	,	fittingly	enough	,	is	called	the	diluent	gas	supply	.
in	our	applications	,	we	generally	put	air	inside	this	diluent	gas	supply	,	because	it	's	a	very	cheap	and	easy	source	of	nitrogen	.
so	that	's	where	we	get	our	nitrogen	from	.
but	,	if	we	want	to	go	deeper	,	of	course	,	we	need	another	gas	supply	.
we	need	helium	,	and	the	helium	is	what	we	really	need	to	go	deep	.
and	usually	we	'll	have	a	slightly	larger	cylinder	mounted	exterior	on	the	rebreather	,	like	this	.
and	that	's	what	we	use	to	inject	,	as	we	start	to	do	our	deep	dives	.
we	also	have	a	second	oxygen	cylinder	,	that	's	solely	as	a	back	-	up	in	case	there	's	a	problem	with	our	first	oxygen	supply	we	can	continue	to	breathe	.
and	the	way	you	manage	all	these	different	gases	and	all	these	different	gas	supplies	is	this	really	high	-	tech	,	sophisticated	gas	block	up	on	the	front	here	,	where	it	's	easy	to	reach	.
it	's	got	all	the	valves	and	knobs	and	things	you	need	to	do	to	inject	the	right	gases	at	the	right	time	.
now	,	normally	you	do	n't	have	to	do	that	because	all	of	it	's	done	automatically	for	you	with	the	electronics	,	the	third	system	of	a	rebreather	.
the	most	critical	part	of	a	rebreather	is	the	oxygen	sensors	.
you	need	three	of	them	,	so	that	if	one	of	them	goes	bad	,	you	know	which	one	it	is	.
you	need	voting	logic	.
you	also	have	three	microprocessors	.
any	one	of	those	computers	can	run	the	entire	system	,	so	if	you	have	to	lose	two	of	them	,	there	's	also	back	-	up	power	supplies	.
and	of	course	there	're	multiple	displays	,	to	get	the	information	to	the	diver	.
this	is	the	high	-	tech	gadgetry	that	allows	us	to	do	what	we	do	on	these	kinds	of	deep	dives	.
and	i	can	talk	about	it	all	day	--	just	ask	my	wife	--	but	i	want	to	move	on	to	something	that	's	kind	of	much	more	interesting	.
i	'm	going	to	take	you	on	a	deep	dive	.
i	'm	going	to	show	you	what	it	's	like	to	do	one	of	these	dives	that	we	do	.
we	start	up	here	on	the	boat	,	and	for	all	this	high	-	tech	,	expensive	equipment	,	this	is	still	the	best	way	to	get	in	the	water	--	just	pfft	!	--	flop	over	the	side	of	the	boat	.
now	,	as	i	showed	you	in	the	earlier	diagram	,	these	reefs	that	we	dive	on	start	out	near	the	surface	and	they	go	almost	vertically	,	completely	straight	down	.
so	,	we	drop	in	the	water	,	and	we	just	sort	of	go	over	the	edge	of	this	cliff	,	and	then	we	just	start	dropping	,	dropping	,	dropping	.
people	have	asked	me	,	``	it	must	take	a	long	time	to	get	there	?	``
no	,	it	only	takes	a	couple	of	minutes	to	get	all	the	way	down	to	three	or	four	hundred	feet	,	which	is	where	we	're	aiming	for	.
it	's	kind	of	like	skydiving	in	slow	motion	.
it	's	really	a	very	interesting	--	you	ever	see	``	the	abyss	``	where	ed	harris	,	you	know	,	he	's	sinking	down	along	the	side	of	the	wall	?
that	's	kind	of	what	it	feels	like	.	it	's	pretty	amazing	.
also	,	when	you	get	down	there	,	you	find	that	the	water	is	very	,	very	clear	.
it	's	extremely	clear	water	,	because	there	's	hardly	any	plankton	.
but	,	when	you	turn	on	your	light	,	you	look	around	at	the	caves	,	and	all	of	a	sudden	you	're	confronted	with	a	tremendous	amount	of	diversity	,	much	more	than	anyone	used	to	believe	.
now	not	all	of	it	is	new	species	--	like	that	fish	you	see	with	the	white	stripe	,	that	's	a	known	species	.
but	,	if	you	look	carefully	into	the	cracks	and	crevices	,	you	'll	see	little	things	scurrying	all	over	the	place	.
there	's	a	just	-	unbelievable	diversity	.
it	's	not	just	fish	,	either	.
these	are	crinoids	,	sponges	,	black	corals	.	there	're	some	more	fishes	.
and	those	fishes	that	you	see	right	now	are	new	species	.
they	're	still	new	species	because	i	had	a	video	camera	on	this	dive	instead	of	my	net	,	so	they	're	still	waiting	down	there	for	someone	to	go	find	them	.
but	this	is	what	it	looks	like	,	and	this	kind	of	habitat	just	goes	on	and	on	and	on	for	miles	.
this	is	papua	,	new	guinea	.
now	little	fishes	and	invertebrates	are	n't	the	only	things	we	see	down	there	.
we	also	see	sharks	,	much	more	regularly	than	i	would	have	expected	to	.
and	we	're	not	quite	sure	why	.
but	what	i	want	you	to	do	right	now	is	imagine	yourself	400	feet	underwater	,	with	all	this	high	-	tech	gear	on	your	back	,	you	're	in	a	remote	reef	off	papua	,	new	guinea	,	thousands	of	miles	from	the	nearest	recompression	chamber	,	and	you	're	completely	surrounded	by	sharks	.
video	:	look	at	those	...
uh	-	oh	...	uh	-	oh	!
i	think	we	have	their	attention	.
richard	pyle	:	when	you	start	talking	like	donald	duck	,	there	's	no	situation	in	the	world	that	can	seem	tense	.
so	,	we	're	down	there	,	and	this	is	at	400	feet	--	that	's	looking	straight	up	,	by	the	way	,	so	you	can	get	a	sense	of	how	far	away	the	surface	is	.
and	if	you	're	a	biologist	and	you	know	about	sharks	,	and	you	want	to	assess	,	you	know	,	how	much	jeopardy	am	i	really	in	here	,	there	's	one	question	that	sort	of	jumps	to	the	forefront	of	your	mind	immediately	which	is	--	diver	1	:	what	kind	of	sharks	?
diver	2	:	uh	,	silvertip	sharks	.
diver	1	:	oh	.
rp	:	silvertip	sharks	--	they	're	actually	three	species	of	sharks	here	.
the	silvertips	are	the	one	with	the	white	edges	on	the	fin	,	and	there	're	also	gray	reef	sharks	and	some	hammerheads	off	in	the	distance	.
and	yes	,	it	's	a	little	nerve	-	wracking	.
diver	2	:	hoo	!
that	little	guy	is	frisky	!
now	,	you	've	seen	video	like	this	on	tv	a	lot	,	and	it	's	very	intimidating	,	and	i	think	it	gives	the	wrong	impression	about	sharks	.
sharks	are	actually	not	very	dangerous	animals	and	that	's	why	we	were	n't	worried	much	,	why	we	were	joking	around	down	there	.
more	people	are	killed	by	pigs	,	more	people	are	killed	by	lightning	strikes	,	more	people	are	killed	at	soccer	games	in	england	.
there	's	a	lot	of	other	ways	you	can	die	.
and	i	'm	not	making	that	stuff	up	.
coconuts	!	you	can	get	killed	by	a	coconut	more	likely	than	killed	by	a	shark	.
so	sharks	are	n't	quite	as	dangerous	as	most	people	make	them	out	to	be	.
now	,	i	do	n't	know	if	any	of	you	get	u.s.	news	and	world	report	--	i	got	the	recent	issue	.
there	's	a	cover	story	all	about	the	great	explorers	of	our	time	.
the	last	article	is	an	article	entitled	``	no	new	frontiers	.	``
it	questions	whether	or	not	there	really	are	any	new	frontiers	out	there	,	whether	there	are	any	real	,	true	,	hardcore	discoveries	that	can	still	be	made	.
as	a	fish	nerd	,	i	have	to	laugh	,	because	you	know	they	do	n't	call	us	fish	nerds	for	nothing	--	we	actually	do	get	excited	about	finding	a	new	dorsal	spine	in	a	guppy	.
but	,	it	's	much	more	than	that	.
and	,	i	want	to	show	you	a	few	of	the	guppies	we	've	found	over	the	years	.
this	one	's	--	you	know	,	you	can	see	how	ugly	it	is	.
even	if	you	ignore	the	scientific	value	of	this	thing	,	just	look	at	the	monetary	value	of	this	thing	.
a	couple	of	these	ended	up	getting	sold	through	the	aquarium	trade	to	japan	,	where	they	sold	for	15,000	dollars	apiece	.
that	's	half	-	a	-	million	dollars	per	pound	.
here	's	another	new	angelfish	we	discovered	.
this	one	we	actually	first	discovered	back	in	the	air	days	--	the	bad	old	air	days	,	as	we	used	to	say	--	when	we	were	doing	these	kind	of	dives	with	air	.
we	were	at	360	feet	.
and	i	remember	coming	up	from	one	of	these	deep	dives	,	and	i	had	this	fog	,	and	the	narcosis	takes	a	little	while	to	,	you	know	,	fade	away	.
it	's	sort	of	like	sobering	up	.
and	i	had	this	vague	recollection	of	seeing	these	yellow	fish	with	a	black	spot	,	and	i	thought	,	``	aw	,	damn	.	i	should	have	caught	one	.
i	think	that	's	a	new	species	.	``
and	then	,	eventually	,	i	got	around	to	looking	in	my	bucket	.
sure	enough	,	i	had	caught	one	--	i	just	completely	forgot	that	i	had	caught	one	.
and	so	this	one	we	decided	to	give	the	name	centropyge	narcosis	to	.
so	that	's	it	's	official	scientific	name	,	in	reference	to	its	deep	-	dwelling	habits	.
and	this	is	another	neat	one	.
when	we	first	found	it	,	we	were	n't	even	sure	what	family	this	thing	belonged	to	,	so	we	just	called	it	the	dr.	seuss	fish	,	because	it	looked	like	something	out	of	one	of	those	books	.
now	,	this	one	's	pretty	cool	.
if	you	go	to	papua	,	new	guinea	,	and	go	down	300	feet	,	you	're	going	to	see	these	big	mounds	.
and	this	may	be	kind	of	hard	to	see	,	but	they	're	about	--	oh	,	a	couple	meters	in	diameter	.
if	you	look	closely	,	you	'll	see	there	's	a	little	white	fish	and	gray	fish	that	hangs	out	near	them	.
well	,	it	turns	out	this	little	white	fish	builds	these	giant	mounds	,	one	pebble	at	a	time	.
it	's	really	extraordinary	to	find	something	like	this	.
it	's	not	just	new	species	:	it	's	new	behavior	,	it	's	new	ecology	it	's	all	kind	of	new	things	.
so	,	what	i	'm	going	to	show	you	right	now	,	very	quickly	,	is	just	a	sampling	of	a	few	of	the	new	species	we	've	discovered	.
what	's	extraordinary	about	this	is	not	just	the	sheer	number	of	species	we	're	finding	--	although	as	you	can	see	that	's	pretty	amazing	,	this	is	only	half	of	what	we	've	found	--	what	's	extraordinary	is	how	quickly	we	find	them	.
we	're	up	to	seven	new	species	per	hour	of	time	we	spend	at	that	depth	.
now	,	if	you	go	to	an	amazon	jungle	and	fog	a	tree	,	you	may	get	a	lot	of	bugs	,	but	for	fishes	,	there	's	nowhere	in	the	world	you	can	get	seven	new	species	per	hour	of	time	.
now	,	we	've	done	some	back	of	the	envelope	calculations	,	and	we	're	predicting	that	there	are	probably	on	the	order	of	2,000	to	2,500	new	species	in	the	indo	-	pacific	alone	.
there	are	only	five	to	six	thousand	known	species	.
so	a	very	large	percentage	of	what	is	out	there	is	n't	really	known	.
we	thought	we	had	a	handle	on	all	the	reef	fish	diversity	--	evidently	not	.
and	i	'm	going	to	just	close	on	a	very	somber	note	.
at	the	beginning	i	told	you	that	i	was	going	to	show	you	two	extraordinary	photographs	.
this	is	the	second	extraordinary	photograph	i	'm	going	to	show	you	.
this	one	was	taken	at	the	exact	moment	i	was	down	there	filming	those	sharks	.
this	was	taken	exactly	300	feet	above	my	head	.
and	the	reason	this	photograph	is	extraordinary	is	because	it	captures	a	moment	in	the	very	last	minute	of	a	person	's	life	.
less	than	60	seconds	after	this	picture	was	taken	,	this	guy	was	dead	.
when	we	recovered	his	body	,	we	figured	out	what	had	gone	wrong	.
he	had	made	a	very	simple	mistake	.
he	turned	the	wrong	valve	when	he	filled	his	cylinder	--	he	had	80	percent	oxygen	in	his	tank	when	he	should	have	had	40	.
he	had	an	oxygen	toxicity	seizure	and	he	drowned	.
the	reason	i	show	this	--	not	to	put	a	downer	on	everything	--	but	i	just	want	to	use	it	to	key	off	my	philosophy	of	life	in	general	,	which	is	that	we	all	have	two	goals	.
the	first	goal	we	share	with	every	other	living	thing	on	this	planet	,	which	is	to	survive	.	i	call	it	perpetuation	:	the	survival	of	the	species	and	survival	of	ourselves	,	because	they	're	both	about	perpetuating	the	genome	.
and	the	second	goal	,	for	those	of	us	who	have	mastered	that	first	goal	,	is	to	--	you	know	,	you	call	it	spiritual	fulfillment	,	you	can	call	it	financial	success	,	you	can	call	it	any	number	of	different	things	.
i	call	it	seeking	joy	--	this	pursuit	of	happiness	.
so	,	i	guess	my	theme	on	this	is	this	guy	lived	his	life	to	the	fullest	,	he	absolutely	did	.
you	have	to	balance	those	two	goals	.
if	you	live	your	whole	life	in	fear	--	i	mean	,	life	is	a	sexually	transmitted	disease	with	100	percent	mortality	.
so	,	you	ca	n't	live	your	life	in	fear	.
i	thought	that	was	an	old	one	.
but	,	at	the	same	time	you	do	n't	want	to	get	so	focused	on	rule	number	two	,	or	goal	number	two	,	that	you	neglect	goal	number	one	.
because	once	you	're	dead	,	you	really	ca	n't	enjoy	anything	after	that	.
i	wish	you	all	the	best	of	luck	in	maintaining	that	balance	in	your	future	endeavors	.
thanks	.
