how	do	you	feed	a	city	?
it	's	one	of	the	great	questions	of	our	time	.
yet	it	's	one	that	's	rarely	asked	.
we	take	it	for	granted	that	if	we	go	into	a	shop	or	restaurant	,	or	indeed	into	this	theater	's	foyer	in	about	an	hour	's	time	,	there	is	going	to	be	food	there	waiting	for	us	,	having	magically	come	from	somewhere	.
but	when	you	think	that	every	day	for	a	city	the	size	of	london	,	enough	food	has	to	be	produced	,	transported	,	bought	and	sold	,	cooked	,	eaten	,	disposed	of	,	and	that	something	similar	has	to	happen	every	day	for	every	city	on	earth	,	it	's	remarkable	that	cities	get	fed	at	all	.
we	live	in	places	like	this	as	if	they	're	the	most	natural	things	in	the	world	,	forgetting	that	because	we	're	animals	and	that	we	need	to	eat	,	we	're	actually	as	dependent	on	the	natural	world	as	our	ancient	ancestors	were	.
and	as	more	of	us	move	into	cities	,	more	of	that	natural	world	is	being	transformed	into	extraordinary	landscapes	like	the	one	behind	me	--	it	's	soybean	fields	in	mato	grosso	in	brazil	--	in	order	to	feed	us	.
these	are	extraordinary	landscapes	,	but	few	of	us	ever	get	to	see	them	.
and	increasingly	these	landscapes	are	not	just	feeding	us	either	.
as	more	of	us	move	into	cities	,	more	of	us	are	eating	meat	,	so	that	a	third	of	the	annual	grain	crop	globally	now	gets	fed	to	animals	rather	than	to	us	human	animals	.
and	given	that	it	takes	three	times	as	much	grain	--	actually	ten	times	as	much	grain	--	to	feed	a	human	if	it	's	passed	through	an	animal	first	,	that	's	not	a	very	efficient	way	of	feeding	us	.
and	it	's	an	escalating	problem	too	.
by	2050	,	it	's	estimated	that	twice	the	number	of	us	are	going	to	be	living	in	cities	.
and	it	's	also	estimated	that	there	is	going	to	be	twice	as	much	meat	and	dairy	consumed	.
so	meat	and	urbanism	are	rising	hand	in	hand	.
and	that	's	going	to	pose	an	enormous	problem	.
six	billion	hungry	carnivores	to	feed	,	by	2050	.
that	's	a	big	problem	.	and	actually	if	we	carry	on	as	we	are	,	it	's	a	problem	we	're	very	unlikely	to	be	able	to	solve	.
nineteen	million	hectares	of	rainforest	are	lost	every	year	to	create	new	arable	land	.
although	at	the	same	time	we	're	losing	an	equivalent	amount	of	existing	arables	to	salinization	and	erosion	.
we	're	very	hungry	for	fossil	fuels	too	.
it	takes	about	10	calories	to	produce	every	calorie	of	food	that	we	consume	in	the	west	.
and	even	though	there	is	food	that	we	are	producing	at	great	cost	,	we	do	n't	actually	value	it	.
half	the	food	produced	in	the	usa	is	currently	thrown	away	.
and	to	end	all	of	this	,	at	the	end	of	this	long	process	,	we	're	not	even	managing	to	feed	the	planet	properly	.
a	billion	of	us	are	obese	,	while	a	further	billion	starve	.
none	of	it	makes	very	much	sense	.
and	when	you	think	that	80	percent	of	global	trade	in	food	now	is	controlled	by	just	five	multinational	corporations	,	it	's	a	grim	picture	.
as	we	're	moving	into	cities	,	the	world	is	also	embracing	a	western	diet	.
and	if	we	look	to	the	future	,	it	's	an	unsustainable	diet	.
so	how	did	we	get	here	?
and	more	importantly	,	what	are	we	going	to	do	about	it	?
well	,	to	answer	the	slightly	easier	question	first	,	about	10,000	years	ago	,	i	would	say	,	is	the	beginning	of	this	process	in	the	ancient	near	east	,	known	as	the	fertile	crescent	.
because	,	as	you	can	see	,	it	was	crescent	shaped	.
and	it	was	also	fertile	.
and	it	was	here	,	about	10,000	years	ago	,	that	two	extraordinary	inventions	,	agriculture	and	urbanism	,	happened	roughly	in	the	same	place	and	at	the	same	time	.
this	is	no	accident	,	because	agriculture	and	cities	are	bound	together	.	they	need	each	other	.
because	it	was	discovery	of	grain	by	our	ancient	ancestors	for	the	first	time	that	produced	a	food	source	that	was	large	enough	and	stable	enough	to	support	permanent	settlements	.
and	if	we	look	at	what	those	settlements	were	like	,	we	see	they	were	compact	.
they	were	surrounded	by	productive	farm	land	and	dominated	by	large	temple	complexes	like	this	one	at	ur	,	that	were	,	in	fact	,	effectively	,	spiritualized	,	central	food	distribution	centers	.
because	it	was	the	temples	that	organized	the	harvest	,	gathered	in	the	grain	,	offered	it	to	the	gods	,	and	then	offered	the	grain	that	the	gods	did	n't	eat	back	to	the	people	.
so	,	if	you	like	,	the	whole	spiritual	and	physical	life	of	these	cities	was	dominated	by	the	grain	and	the	harvest	that	sustained	them	.
and	in	fact	,	that	's	true	of	every	ancient	city	.
but	of	course	not	all	of	them	were	that	small	.
famously	,	rome	had	about	a	million	citizens	by	the	first	century	a.d	.
so	how	did	a	city	like	this	feed	itself	?
the	answer	is	what	i	call	``	ancient	food	miles	.	``
basically	,	rome	had	access	to	the	sea	,	which	made	it	possible	for	it	to	import	food	from	a	very	long	way	away	.
this	is	the	only	way	it	was	possible	to	do	this	in	the	ancient	world	,	because	it	was	very	difficult	to	transport	food	over	roads	,	which	were	rough	.
and	the	food	obviously	went	off	very	quickly	.
so	rome	effectively	waged	war	on	places	like	carthage	and	egypt	just	to	get	its	paws	on	their	grain	reserves	.
and	,	in	fact	,	you	could	say	that	the	expansion	of	the	empire	was	really	sort	of	one	long	,	drawn	out	militarized	shopping	spree	,	really	.
in	fact	--	i	love	the	fact	,	i	just	have	to	mention	this	:	rome	in	fact	used	to	import	oysters	from	london	,	at	one	stage	.	i	think	that	's	extraordinary	.
so	rome	shaped	its	hinterland	through	its	appetite	.
but	the	interesting	thing	is	that	the	other	thing	also	happened	in	the	pre	-	industrial	world	.
if	we	look	at	a	map	of	london	in	the	17th	century	,	we	can	see	that	its	grain	,	which	is	coming	in	from	the	thames	,	along	the	bottom	of	this	map	.
so	the	grain	markets	were	to	the	south	of	the	city	.
and	the	roads	leading	up	from	them	to	cheapside	,	which	was	the	main	market	,	were	also	grain	markets	.
and	if	you	look	at	the	name	of	one	of	those	streets	,	bread	street	,	you	can	tell	what	was	going	on	there	300	years	ago	.
and	the	same	of	course	was	true	for	fish	.
fish	was	,	of	course	,	coming	in	by	river	as	well	.	same	thing	.
and	of	course	billingsgate	,	famously	,	was	london	's	fish	market	,	operating	on	-	site	here	until	the	mid	-	1980s	.
which	is	extraordinary	,	really	,	when	you	think	about	it	.
everybody	else	was	wandering	around	with	mobile	phones	that	looked	like	bricks	and	sort	of	smelly	fish	happening	down	on	the	port	.
this	is	another	thing	about	food	in	cities	:	once	its	roots	into	the	city	are	established	,	they	very	rarely	move	.
meat	is	a	very	different	story	because	,	of	course	,	animals	could	walk	into	the	city	.
so	much	of	london	's	meat	was	coming	from	the	northwest	,	from	scotland	and	wales	.
so	it	was	coming	in	,	and	arriving	at	the	city	at	the	northwest	,	london	's	very	famous	meat	market	,	was	located	up	there	.
poultry	was	coming	in	from	east	anglia	and	so	on	,	to	the	northeast	.
i	feel	a	bit	like	a	weather	woman	doing	this	.	anyway	,	and	so	the	birds	were	coming	in	with	their	feet	protected	with	little	canvas	shoes	.
and	then	when	they	hit	the	eastern	end	of	cheapside	,	that	's	where	they	were	sold	,	which	is	why	it	's	called	poultry	.
and	,	in	fact	,	if	you	look	at	the	map	of	any	city	built	before	the	industrial	age	,	you	can	trace	food	coming	in	to	it	.
you	can	actually	see	how	it	was	physically	shaped	by	food	,	both	by	reading	the	names	of	the	streets	,	which	give	you	a	lot	of	clues	.
friday	street	,	in	a	previous	life	,	is	where	you	went	to	buy	your	fish	on	a	friday	.
but	also	you	have	to	imagine	it	full	of	food	.
because	the	streets	and	the	public	spaces	were	the	only	places	where	food	was	bought	and	sold	.
and	if	we	look	at	an	image	of	smithfield	in	1830	you	can	see	that	it	would	have	been	very	difficult	to	live	in	a	city	like	this	and	be	unaware	of	where	your	food	came	from	.
in	fact	,	if	you	were	having	sunday	lunch	,	the	chances	were	it	was	mooing	or	bleating	outside	your	window	about	three	days	earlier	.
so	this	was	obviously	an	organic	city	,	part	of	an	organic	cycle	.
and	then	10	years	later	everything	changed	.
this	is	an	image	of	the	great	western	in	1840	.
and	as	you	can	see	,	some	of	the	earliest	train	passengers	were	pigs	and	sheep	.
so	all	of	a	sudden	,	these	animals	are	no	longer	walking	into	market	.
they	're	being	slaughtered	out	of	sight	and	mind	,	somewhere	in	the	countryside	.
and	they	're	coming	into	the	city	by	rail	.
and	this	changes	everything	.
to	start	off	with	,	it	makes	it	possible	for	the	first	time	to	grow	cities	,	really	any	size	and	shape	,	in	any	place	.
cities	used	to	be	constrained	by	geography	;	they	used	to	have	to	get	their	food	through	very	difficult	physical	means	.
all	of	a	sudden	they	are	effectively	emancipated	from	geography	.
and	as	you	can	see	from	these	maps	of	london	,	in	the	90	years	after	the	trains	came	,	it	goes	from	being	a	little	blob	that	was	quite	easy	to	feed	by	animals	coming	in	on	foot	,	and	so	on	,	to	a	large	splurge	,	that	would	be	very	,	very	difficult	to	feed	with	anybody	on	foot	,	either	animals	or	people	.
and	of	course	that	was	just	the	beginning	.	after	the	trains	came	cars	,	and	really	this	marks	the	end	of	this	process	.
it	's	the	final	emancipation	of	the	city	from	any	apparent	relationship	with	nature	at	all	.
and	this	is	the	kind	of	city	that	's	devoid	of	smell	,	devoid	of	mess	,	certainly	devoid	of	people	,	because	nobody	would	have	dreamed	of	walking	in	such	a	landscape	.
in	fact	,	what	they	did	to	get	food	was	they	got	in	their	cars	,	drove	to	a	box	somewhere	on	the	outskirts	,	came	back	with	a	week	's	worth	of	shopping	,	and	wondered	what	on	earth	to	do	with	it	.
and	this	really	is	the	moment	when	our	relationship	,	both	with	food	and	cities	,	changes	completely	.
here	we	have	food	--	that	used	to	be	the	center	,	the	social	core	of	the	city	--	at	the	periphery	.
it	used	to	be	a	social	event	,	buying	and	selling	food	.
now	it	's	anonymous	.
we	used	to	cook	;	now	we	just	add	water	,	or	a	little	bit	of	an	egg	if	you	're	making	a	cake	or	something	.
we	do	n't	smell	food	to	see	if	it	's	okay	to	eat	.
we	just	read	the	back	of	a	label	on	a	packet	.
and	we	do	n't	value	food	.	we	do	n't	trust	it	.
so	instead	of	trusting	it	,	we	fear	it	.
and	instead	of	valuing	it	,	we	throw	it	away	.
one	of	the	great	ironies	of	modern	food	systems	is	that	they	've	made	the	very	thing	they	promised	to	make	easier	much	harder	.
by	making	it	possible	to	build	cities	anywhere	and	any	place	,	they	've	actually	distanced	us	from	our	most	important	relationship	,	which	is	that	of	us	and	nature	.
and	also	they	've	made	us	dependent	on	systems	that	only	they	can	deliver	,	that	,	as	we	've	seen	,	are	unsustainable	.
so	what	are	we	going	to	do	about	that	?
it	's	not	a	new	question	.
500	years	ago	it	's	what	thomas	more	was	asking	himself	.
this	is	the	frontispiece	of	his	book	``	utopia	.	``
and	it	was	a	series	of	semi	-	independent	city	-	states	,	if	that	sounds	remotely	familiar	,	a	day	's	walk	from	one	another	where	everyone	was	basically	farming	-	mad	,	and	grew	vegetables	in	their	back	gardens	,	and	ate	communal	meals	together	,	and	so	on	.
and	i	think	you	could	argue	that	food	is	a	fundamental	ordering	principle	of	utopia	,	even	though	more	never	framed	it	that	way	.
and	here	is	another	very	famous	``	utopian	``	vision	,	that	of	ebenezer	howard	,	``	the	garden	city	.	``
same	idea	:	series	of	semi	-	independent	city	-	states	,	little	blobs	of	metropolitan	stuff	with	arable	land	around	,	joined	to	one	another	by	railway	.
and	again	,	food	could	be	said	to	be	the	ordering	principle	of	his	vision	.
it	even	got	built	,	but	nothing	to	do	with	this	vision	that	howard	had	.
and	that	is	the	problem	with	these	utopian	ideas	,	that	they	are	utopian	.
utopia	was	actually	a	word	that	thomas	moore	used	deliberately	.
it	was	a	kind	of	joke	,	because	it	's	got	a	double	derivation	from	the	greek	.
it	can	either	mean	a	good	place	,	or	no	place	.
because	it	's	an	ideal	.	it	's	an	imaginary	thing	.	we	ca	n't	have	it	.
and	i	think	,	as	a	conceptual	tool	for	thinking	about	the	very	deep	problem	of	human	dwelling	,	that	makes	it	not	much	use	.
so	i	've	come	up	with	an	alternative	,	which	is	sitopia	,	from	the	ancient	greek	,	``	sitos	``	for	food	,	and	``	topos	``	for	place	.
i	believe	we	already	live	in	sitopia	.
we	live	in	a	world	shaped	by	food	,	and	if	we	realize	that	,	we	can	use	food	as	a	really	powerful	tool	--	a	conceptual	tool	,	design	tool	,	to	shape	the	world	differently	.
so	if	we	were	to	do	that	,	what	might	sitopia	look	like	?
well	i	think	it	looks	a	bit	like	this	.
i	have	to	use	this	slide	.	it	's	just	the	look	on	the	face	of	the	dog	.
but	anyway	,	this	is	--	it	's	food	at	the	center	of	life	,	at	the	center	of	family	life	,	being	celebrated	,	being	enjoyed	,	people	taking	time	for	it	.
this	is	where	food	should	be	in	our	society	.
but	you	ca	n't	have	scenes	like	this	unless	you	have	people	like	this	.
by	the	way	,	these	can	be	men	as	well	.
it	's	people	who	think	about	food	,	who	think	ahead	,	who	plan	,	who	can	stare	at	a	pile	of	raw	vegetables	and	actually	recognize	them	.
we	need	these	people	.	we	're	part	of	a	network	.
because	without	these	kinds	of	people	we	ca	n't	have	places	like	this	.
here	,	i	deliberately	chose	this	because	it	is	a	man	buying	a	vegetable	.
but	networks	,	markets	where	food	is	being	grown	locally	.
it	's	common	.	it	's	fresh	.
it	's	part	of	the	social	life	of	the	city	.
because	without	that	,	you	ca	n't	have	this	kind	of	place	,	food	that	is	grown	locally	and	also	is	part	of	the	landscape	,	and	is	not	just	a	zero	-	sum	commodity	off	in	some	unseen	hell	-	hole	.
cows	with	a	view	.
steaming	piles	of	humus	.
this	is	basically	bringing	the	whole	thing	together	.
and	this	is	a	community	project	i	visited	recently	in	toronto	.
it	's	a	greenhouse	,	where	kids	get	told	all	about	food	and	growing	their	own	food	.
here	is	a	plant	called	kevin	,	or	maybe	it	's	a	plant	belonging	to	a	kid	called	kevin	.	i	do	n't	know	.
but	anyway	,	these	kinds	of	projects	that	are	trying	to	reconnect	us	with	nature	is	extremely	important	.
so	sitopia	,	for	me	,	is	really	a	way	of	seeing	.
it	's	basically	recognizing	that	sitopia	already	exists	in	little	pockets	everywhere	.
the	trick	is	to	join	them	up	,	to	use	food	as	a	way	of	seeing	.
and	if	we	do	that	,	we	're	going	to	stop	seeing	cities	as	big	,	metropolitan	,	unproductive	blobs	,	like	this	.
we	're	going	to	see	them	more	like	this	,	as	part	of	the	productive	,	organic	framework	of	which	they	are	inevitably	a	part	,	but	of	course	,	that	's	not	a	great	image	either	,	because	we	need	not	to	be	producing	food	like	this	anymore	.
we	need	to	be	thinking	more	about	permaculture	,	which	is	why	i	think	this	image	just	sums	up	for	me	the	kind	of	thinking	we	need	to	be	doing	.
it	's	a	re	-	conceptualization	of	the	way	food	shapes	our	lives	.
the	best	image	i	know	of	this	is	from	650	years	ago	.
it	's	ambrogio	lorenzetti	's	``	allegory	of	good	government	.	``
it	's	about	the	relationship	between	the	city	and	the	countryside	.
and	i	think	the	message	of	this	is	very	clear	.
if	the	city	looks	after	the	country	,	the	country	will	look	after	the	city	.
and	i	want	us	to	ask	now	,	what	would	ambrogio	lorenzetti	paint	if	he	painted	this	image	today	?
what	would	an	allegory	of	good	government	look	like	today	?
because	i	think	it	's	an	urgent	question	.
it	's	one	we	have	to	ask	,	and	we	have	to	start	answering	.
we	know	we	are	what	we	eat	.
we	need	to	realize	that	the	world	is	also	what	we	eat	.
but	if	we	take	that	idea	,	we	can	use	food	as	a	really	powerful	tool	to	shape	the	world	better	.
thank	you	very	much	.
