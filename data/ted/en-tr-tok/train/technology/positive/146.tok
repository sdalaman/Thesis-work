i	've	always	wanted	to	be	a	cyborg	.
one	of	my	favorite	shows	as	a	kid	was	``	the	six	million	dollar	man	,	``	and	this	is	a	little	bit	closer	to	the	240	dollar	man	or	so	,	but	--	at	at	any	rate	.	i	would	normally	feel	very	self	-	conscious	and	geeky	wearing	this	around	,	but	a	few	days	ago	i	saw	one	world	-	renowned	statistician	swallowing	swords	on	stage	here	,	so	i	figure	it	's	ok	amongst	this	group	.
but	that	's	not	what	i	want	to	talk	about	today	.
i	want	to	talk	about	toys	,	and	the	power	that	i	see	inherent	in	them	.
when	i	was	a	kid	,	i	attended	montessori	school	up	to	sixth	grade	in	atlanta	,	georgia	.
and	at	the	time	i	did	n't	think	much	about	it	,	but	then	later	,	i	realized	that	that	was	the	high	point	of	my	education	.
from	that	point	on	,	everything	else	was	pretty	much	downhill	.
and	it	was	n't	until	later	,	as	i	started	making	games	,	that	--	i	really	actually	think	of	them	more	as	toys	.
people	call	me	a	game	designer	,	but	i	really	think	of	these	things	more	as	toys	.
but	i	started	getting	very	interested	in	maria	montessori	and	her	methods	,	and	the	way	she	went	about	things	,	and	the	way	she	thought	it	very	valuable	for	kids	to	kind	of	discover	things	on	their	own	rather	than	being	taught	these	things	overtly	.
and	she	would	design	these	toys	,	where	kids	in	playing	with	the	toys	would	actually	come	to	understand	these	deep	principles	of	life	and	nature	through	play	.
and	since	they	discovered	those	things	,	it	really	stuck	with	them	so	much	more	,	and	also	they	would	experience	their	own	failures	;	there	was	a	failure	-	based	aspect	to	learning	there	.	it	was	very	important	.
and	so	,	the	games	that	i	do	,	i	think	of	really	more	as	modern	montessori	toys	.
and	i	really	kind	of	want	them	to	be	presented	in	a	way	to	where	kids	can	kind	of	explore	and	discover	their	own	principles	.
so	a	few	years	ago	,	i	actually	started	getting	very	interested	in	the	seti	program	.	and	that	's	the	way	i	work	.
i	get	interested	in	different	kinds	of	subjects	,	i	dive	in	,	i	research	them	,	and	then	i	try	to	figure	out	how	to	craft	a	toy	around	that	,	so	that	other	people	can	kind	of	experience	the	same	sense	of	discovery	as	i	did	as	i	was	learning	that	subject	.
and	it	kind	of	led	me	to	astrobiology	,	which	is	the	study	of	possible	life	in	the	universe	.
and	then	drake	's	equation	,	which	is	looking	at	the	probability	of	life	arising	on	planets	,	how	long	it	might	last	,	how	many	planets	are	out	there	,	stuff	like	that	.
and	i	started	looking	at	how	interesting	drake	's	equation	was	,	because	it	spanned	all	these	different	subjects	--	physics	,	chemistry	,	sociology	,	economics	,	astronomy	.
and	another	thing	that	really	impressed	me	a	long	time	ago	was	``	powers	of	ten	,	``	charles	and	ray	eames	'	film	.
and	i	started	putting	those	two	together	and	wondering	,	could	i	build	a	toy	where	kids	would	kind	of	trip	across	all	these	interesting	principles	of	life	,	as	it	exists	and	as	it	might	go	in	the	future	.
things	where	you	might	trip	across	things	like	the	copernican	principle	,	the	fermi	paradox	,	the	anthropic	principle	,	the	origin	of	life	.
and	so	i	'm	going	to	show	you	a	toy	today	that	i	've	been	working	on	,	that	i	think	of	more	than	anything	else	as	kind	of	a	philosophy	toy	.
in	playing	this	toy	,	you	kind	of	--	this	will	bring	up	philosophical	questions	in	you	.
this	game	's	called	``	spore	.	``	i	've	been	working	on	it	for	several	years	.
it	's	getting	pretty	close	to	finished	now	.
it	occurs	at	all	these	different	scales	,	first	of	all	,	from	very	,	very	small	to	very	,	very	large	.
i	'm	just	going	to	pop	in	at	the	start	of	the	game	.
and	you	actually	start	this	game	in	a	drop	of	water	,	as	a	very	,	very	small	single	-	cell	creature	,	and	right	off	the	bat	you	basically	just	have	to	live	,	survive	,	reproduce	.
so	here	we	are	,	at	a	very	microscopic	scale	,	swimming	around	.	and	i	actually	realize	that	cells	do	n't	have	eyes	,	but	it	helps	to	make	it	cute	.
the	players	are	going	to	play	through	every	generation	of	this	species	,	and	as	you	play	the	game	the	creature	is	actually	growing	bit	by	bit	.
and	as	we	start	growing	the	camera	will	actually	start	zooming	out	,	and	things	that	you	see	in	the	background	there	will	actually	start	slowly	pulling	into	the	foreground	,	showing	you	a	little	bit	of	what	you	'll	be	interacting	with	as	you	grow	.
so	as	we	eat	,	the	camera	starts	pulling	out	,	and	then	we	start	interacting	with	kind	of	larger	and	larger	organisms	.
now	,	we	actually	play	through	many	generations	here	,	at	the	cellular	scale	.
i	'm	going	to	skip	ahead	here	.	at	some	point	we	get	larger	,	and	we	actually	get	to	a	macro	-	evolution	scale	.
now	at	this	point	we	're	leaving	the	water	,	and	one	thing	that	's	kind	of	important	about	this	game	is	that	,	at	every	level	,	the	player	is	designing	their	creature	,	and	that	's	a	fundamental	aspect	of	this	.
now	,	in	the	evolution	game	here	,	the	creature	scale	,	basically	you	have	to	eat	,	survive	,	and	then	reproduce	.	you	know	,	very	darwinian	.
one	thing	we	noticed	with	``	the	sims	,	``	which	is	a	game	i	did	earlier	,	is	that	players	love	making	stuff	.
when	they	were	able	to	make	stuff	in	the	game	they	had	a	tremendous	amount	of	empathy	in	connection	to	it	.	even	if	it	was	n't	as	pretty	as	what	other	people	would	make	it	--	as	a	professional	artist	would	make	for	games	--	it	really	stuck	with	them	and	they	really	cared	about	what	would	happen	to	it	.
so	at	this	point	,	we	've	left	the	water	,	and	now	with	this	little	creature	--	we	could	bring	up	the	volume	a	little	bit	--	and	now	we	might	try	to	eat	.
we	might	sneak	up	on	this	little	guy	over	here	maybe	,	and	try	and	eat	him	.
ok	,	well	,	we	fight	.
ok	,	we	got	him	.	now	we	get	a	meal	.
so	really	,	at	this	part	of	the	game	,	what	we	're	doing	is	we	're	running	around	and	surviving	,	and	also	getting	to	the	next	generation	,	because	we	're	going	to	play	through	every	generation	of	this	creature	.
we	can	mate	,	so	i	'm	going	to	see	if	one	of	these	creatures	wants	to	mate	with	me	.	yeah	.
we	did	n't	want	to	replay	actual	evolution	with	humans	and	all	that	,	because	it	's	almost	more	interesting	to	look	at	alternate	possibilities	in	evolution	.
evolution	is	usually	presented	as	this	one	path	that	we	took	through	,	but	really	it	represents	this	huge	set	of	possibilities	.
now	once	we	mate	,	we	click	on	the	egg	.
and	this	is	where	the	game	starts	getting	interesting	,	because	one	of	the	things	we	really	focused	on	here	was	giving	the	players	very	high	-	leverage	tools	,	so	that	for	a	very	small	amount	of	effort	the	player	can	make	something	very	cool	.	and	it	involves	a	lot	of	intelligence	on	the	tool	side	.
but	basically	,	this	is	the	editor	where	we	're	going	to	design	the	next	generation	of	our	creature	.	so	it	has	a	little	spine	.
i	can	move	around	here	.	i	can	extend	.
i	can	also	inflate	or	deflate	it	with	the	mouse	wheel	,	so	you	sculpt	it	like	clay	.	we	have	parts	here	that	i	can	put	on	or	pull	off	.
the	idea	is	that	the	player	can	basically	design	anything	they	can	think	of	in	this	editor	,	and	we	'll	basically	bring	it	to	life	.
so	,	for	instance	,	i	might	put	some	limbs	on	the	character	here	.
i	'll	inflate	them	kind	of	large	.
and	in	this	case	i	might	decide	i	'm	going	to	put	--	i	'll	put	mouths	on	the	limbs	.
so	pretty	much	players	are	encouraged	to	be	very	creative	in	the	game	.
here	,	i	'll	give	it	one	eye	in	the	middle	,	maybe	scale	it	up	a	bit	.	point	it	down	.
and	i	'll	also	give	it	a	few	legs	.
so	in	some	sense	we	want	this	to	feel	like	an	amplifier	for	the	player	's	imagination	,	so	that	with	a	very	small	number	of	clicks	a	player	can	create	something	that	they	did	n't	really	think	was	possible	before	.
you	know	,	this	is	almost	like	designing	something	like	maya	that	an	eight	-	year	-	old	can	use	.
but	really	the	goal	here	was	,	within	about	a	minute	,	i	wanted	somebody	to	replicate	what	typically	takes	a	pictorial	artist	several	weeks	to	create	.
ok	,	now	i	'll	put	some	hands	on	it	.
ok	,	so	here	i	've	basically	thrown	together	a	little	creature	.
let	me	give	it	a	little	weapon	on	the	tail	here	,	so	it	can	fight	.
ok	,	so	that	's	the	complete	model	.	now	we	can	actually	go	to	the	painting	phase	.
now	,	at	this	phase	,	the	program	actually	has	some	understanding	of	the	topology	of	this	creature	.	it	kind	of	knows	where	the	backbone	is	,	where	the	spine	,	the	limbs	are	.
it	kind	of	knows	how	stripes	should	run	,	how	it	should	be	shaded	.
and	so	we	're	procedurally	generating	the	texture	map	,	and	this	is	something	a	texture	artist	would	take	many	,	many	days	to	work	on	.
and	then	we	can	test	it	out	,	once	we	've	done	that	,	and	see	how	it	would	move	around	.
and	so	at	this	point	the	computer	is	procedurally	animating	this	creature	.
it	's	looking	at	whatever	i	've	designed	.	it	will	actually	bring	it	to	life	.
and	i	can	see	how	it	might	dance	.
how	it	might	show	emotions	,	how	it	might	fight	.
so	it	's	acting	with	its	two	mouths	there	.
i	can	even	have	it	pose	for	a	photo	.	snap	a	little	photo	of	it	.
so	at	any	rate	,	then	i	bring	this	back	into	the	game	.	it	's	born	,	and	i	play	the	next	generation	of	my	creature	through	evolution	.
now	again	,	the	empathy	that	the	players	have	when	they	create	the	content	is	tremendous	.	now	,	when	players	create	content	in	this	game	,	it	's	automatically	sent	up	to	a	server	and	then	redistributed	to	all	the	other	players	transparently	.
so	in	fact	,	as	i	'm	interacting	in	this	world	with	other	creatures	,	these	creatures	are	transparently	coming	from	other	players	as	they	play	.
so	the	process	of	playing	the	game	is	a	process	of	building	up	this	huge	database	of	content	.	and	pretty	much	everything	you	're	going	to	see	in	this	game	,	there	's	an	editor	for	in	the	game	that	the	player	can	create	,	all	the	way	up	through	civilization	.	this	is	my	baby	.
when	i	eat	,	i	'll	actually	start	growing	.	this	is	the	next	generation	.
but	i	'm	going	to	skip	way	ahead	here	.	now	,	normally	what	would	happen	is	these	creatures	would	work	their	way	up	,	eventually	become	intelligent	.
i	'd	start	dealing	with	tribes	,	cities	and	civilizations	of	them	over	time	.
i	'm	going	to	skip	way	ahead	here	to	the	space	phase	.
eventually	they	would	go	out	into	space	,	and	start	colonizing	and	exploring	the	universe	.
now	really	,	in	some	sense	,	i	want	the	players	to	be	building	this	world	in	their	imagination	,	and	then	extracting	it	from	them	with	the	least	amount	of	pain	.
so	that	's	kind	of	what	these	tools	are	about	,	are	:	how	do	we	make	the	game	play	the	player	's	imagination	-	amplifier	?
and	how	do	we	make	these	tools	,	these	editors	,	something	that	are	just	as	fun	as	the	game	itself	?
so	this	is	the	planet	that	we	've	been	playing	on	up	to	this	point	in	the	game	.
so	far	the	entire	game	has	been	played	on	the	surface	of	this	little	world	here	.
now	,	at	this	point	we	're	actually	dealing	with	a	very	little	toy	planet	.
almost	,	again	,	like	the	montessori	toy	idea	.
you	know	,	what	happens	if	you	give	somebody	a	toy	planet	,	and	let	them	play	with	a	lot	of	dynamics	on	it	,	what	could	they	discover	?	what	might	they	learn	on	this	?
this	world	was	actually	extracted	from	the	player	's	imagination	.
so	,	this	is	the	planet	that	the	player	evolved	on	.
things	like	the	buildings	,	and	the	vehicles	,	the	architecture	,	civilizations	were	all	designed	by	the	player	up	to	this	point	.
so	here	's	a	little	city	with	some	of	our	guys	kind	of	walking	around	in	it	.
and	most	games	kind	of	put	the	player	in	the	role	of	luke	skywalker	,	this	protagonist	playing	through	this	story	.
really	,	this	is	more	about	putting	the	player	in	the	role	of	george	lucas	,	you	know	?
i	want	them	,	after	they	've	played	this	game	,	to	have	extracted	an	entire	world	that	they	're	now	interacting	with	.
now	,	as	we	pull	down	here	,	we	still	have	a	whole	set	of	creatures	living	on	the	surface	of	the	planet	.	there	are	all	these	different	dynamics	going	on	here	.
in	fact	,	i	can	look	over	here	,	and	this	is	kind	of	a	little	simplified	food	web	that	's	going	on	with	the	creatures	.
i	can	open	this	up	and	then	scan	what	exists	on	the	surface	,	and	get	some	sense	of	the	diversity	of	creatures	that	were	brought	in	.
some	of	these	were	created	by	the	player	,	others	by	other	players	and	automatically	sent	over	here	.
but	there	's	a	very	simple	little	kind	of	calculation	of	what	's	required	,	how	much	plants	are	required	for	the	herbivores	to	live	,	how	many	herbivores	for	the	carnivores	to	eat	,	etc	.	,	that	you	actually	have	to	balance	actively	.
now	also	with	this	phase	,	we	're	getting	more	and	more	god	-	like	powers	for	the	player	,	and	you	can	kind	of	experiment	with	this	planet	again	as	a	toy	.
so	i	can	come	in	and	i	can	do	things	,	and	just	treat	this	planet	as	a	lump	of	clay	.
we	have	very	simple	little	weather	systems	you	see	here	,	very	simple	geology	.	for	instance	,	i	could	open	one	of	my	tools	here	and	then	carve	out	rivers	.
so	this	whole	thing	is	kind	of	like	a	big	lump	of	clay	,	a	sculpture	.
i	can	also	play	with	the	dynamics	of	this	world	over	time	.
so	one	of	the	things	i	can	do	is	start	pumping	more	co	2	gases	into	the	atmosphere	,	and	so	that	's	what	i	'm	doing	here	.
there	's	actually	a	little	read	out	down	there	of	our	planetary	atmosphere	,	pressure	and	temperature	.
so	as	i	start	pumping	in	more	atmosphere	,	we	're	going	to	start	pushing	up	the	greenhouse	gases	here	and	if	you	'll	start	noticing	,	we	start	seeing	the	ocean	levels	rise	over	time	.
and	our	cities	are	going	to	be	at	risk	too	,	because	a	lot	of	these	are	coastal	cities	.
you	can	see	the	ocean	levels	are	rising	now	and	as	they	encroach	upon	the	cities	,	i	'll	start	losing	cities	here	.
so	basically	,	i	want	the	players	to	be	able	to	experiment	and	explore	a	huge	amount	of	failure	space	.	so	there	goes	one	city	.
now	over	time	,	this	is	actually	going	to	heat	up	the	planet	.
so	at	first	what	we	're	going	to	see	is	a	global	ocean	rise	here	on	this	little	toy	planet	,	but	then	over	time	--	i	can	speed	it	up	just	a	little	bit	--	we	'll	actually	see	the	heat	impact	of	that	as	well	.
so	not	only	will	it	get	hotter	,	but	at	some	point	it	's	going	to	get	so	hot	the	oceans	will	entirely	evaporate	.
so	at	first	they	'll	go	up	,	and	then	they	'll	evaporate	,	and	that	'll	be	my	planet	.
so	basically	,	what	we	're	getting	here	is	the	sequel	to	``	an	inconvenient	truth	,	``	in	about	two	minutes	,	and	that	actually	brings	up	an	interesting	point	about	games	.
now	here	,	our	entire	oceans	are	evaporating	off	the	surface	,	and	as	it	keeps	getting	hotter	at	some	point	the	entire	planet	's	going	to	melt	down	.
here	it	goes	.
so	we	're	not	only	simulating	biological	dynamics	--	food	webs	and	all	that	--	but	also	geologic	,	you	know	,	on	a	very	simple	core	scale	.
and	what	's	interesting	to	me	about	games	,	in	some	sense	,	is	that	i	think	we	can	take	a	lot	of	long	-	term	dynamics	and	compress	them	into	very	short	-	term	kind	of	experiences	.
because	it	's	so	hard	for	people	to	think	50	or	100	years	out	,	but	when	you	can	give	them	a	toy	,	and	they	can	experience	these	long	-	term	dynamics	in	just	a	few	minutes	,	i	think	it	's	an	entirely	different	kind	of	point	of	view	,	where	we	're	actually	mapping	,	using	the	game	to	re	-	map	our	intuition	.
it	's	almost	in	the	same	way	that	a	telescope	or	microscope	recalibrates	your	eyesight	;	i	think	computer	simulations	can	recalibrate	your	instinct	across	vast	scales	of	both	space	and	time	.
so	here	's	our	little	solar	system	,	as	we	pull	away	from	our	melted	planet	here	.
we	actually	have	a	couple	of	other	planets	in	this	solar	system	.
let	's	fly	to	another	one	.
so	in	fact	,	we	're	going	to	have	this	unlimited	number	of	worlds	you	can	kind	of	explore	here	.	now	,	as	we	move	into	the	future	,	and	we	start	going	out	in	this	space	and	doing	stuff	,	we	're	drawing	a	lot	from	things	like	science	fiction	.
and	all	my	favorite	science	fiction	movies	i	want	to	basically	play	out	here	as	different	dynamics	.
so	this	planet	actually	has	some	life	on	it	.
here	it	is	,	some	indigenous	life	down	here	.
now	one	of	the	tools	i	can	eventually	earn	for	my	ufo	is	a	monolith	that	i	can	drop	down	.
now	as	you	can	see	,	these	guys	are	actually	starting	to	go	up	and	bow	to	it	,	and	over	time	,	once	they	touch	it	,	they	will	become	intelligent	.
so	i	can	actually	pick	a	species	on	a	planet	and	then	make	them	sentient	.
you	see	,	now	they	've	actually	gone	to	tribal	dynamics	.
and	now	,	because	i	'm	actually	the	one	here	,	i	can	,	if	i	want	to	,	get	out	of	the	ufo	and	walk	up	,	and	they	should	be	worshipping	me	at	this	point	as	a	god	.
at	first	they	're	a	little	freaked	out	.
ok	,	well	maybe	they	're	not	worshipping	me	.
i	think	i	'll	leave	before	they	get	hostile	.
but	we	basically	want	a	diversity	of	activities	the	players	can	play	through	this	.
basically	,	i	want	to	be	able	to	play	,	``	the	day	the	earth	stood	still	,	``	``	2001	:	a	space	odyssey	,	``	``	star	trek	,	``	``	war	of	the	worlds	.	``
now	as	we	pull	away	from	this	world	--	we	're	going	to	keep	pulling	away	from	the	star	now	.
one	of	the	things	that	always	frustrated	me	a	little	bit	about	astronomy	when	i	was	a	kid	is	how	it	was	always	presented	so	two	-	dimensionally	and	so	static	.	as	we	pull	away	from	the	star	here	,	we	're	actually	going	now	out	into	interstellar	space	,	and	we	're	getting	a	sense	of	the	space	around	our	home	star	.
now	what	i	really	wanted	to	do	is	to	present	this	,	basically	as	wonderfully	3d	as	it	is	actually	is	.
and	not	only	that	,	but	also	show	the	dynamics	,	and	a	lot	of	the	interesting	objects	that	you	might	find	,	maybe	like	in	the	hubble	,	at	pretty	much	realistic	frequencies	and	scales	.
so	most	people	have	no	idea	of	the	difference	between	like	,	an	emission	nebula	and	a	planetary	nebula	.
but	these	are	the	things	that	we	can	kind	of	put	in	this	little	galaxy	here	.
so	we	're	flying	over	here	to	what	looks	like	a	black	hole	.
i	want	to	basically	have	the	entire	zoo	of	hubble	objects	that	people	can	kind	of	interact	with	and	play	with	,	again	,	as	toys	.
so	here	's	a	little	black	hole	that	we	probably	do	n't	want	to	get	too	close	to	.
but	we	also	have	stars	and	things	as	well	.
if	we	pull	all	the	way	back	,	we	start	seeing	the	entire	galaxy	here	,	kind	of	slowly	in	motion	.	and	this	is	another	thing	where	,	typically	when	people	present	galaxies	,	it	's	always	been	these	very	beautiful	photos	,	but	they	're	always	static	.	and	when	you	actually	bring	it	forward	in	time	and	start	animating	it	,	it	's	actually	kind	of	amazing	,	what	a	galaxy	would	look	like	,	fast	forwarded	.
this	would	be	about	one	million	years	a	second	,	because	you	have	about	roughly	one	supernova	every	century	or	so	.
and	so	you	'd	have	this	wonderful	sparkling	thing	,	with	the	disk	slowly	rotating	,	and	this	is	roughly	what	it	would	look	like	.	and	so	really	,	part	of	this	is	about	bringing	the	beauty	of	this	,	of	the	natural	world	,	to	somebody	in	a	very	imaginative	way	,	so	that	they	can	start	calibrating	their	instinct	across	these	vast	scales	of	space	and	time	.
chris	was	wondering	what	kind	of	gods	that	the	players	would	become	.
because	if	you	think	about	it	,	you	're	going	to	have	15	-	year	-	olds	,	20	-	year	-	olds	,	whatever	,	flying	around	this	universe	.
and	they	might	be	a	nurturing	god	.	they	might	be	boot	-	strapping	life	on	planets	,	trying	to	terra	-	form	and	spread	civilization	.
you	might	be	a	vengeful	god	and	going	out	and	conquesting	,	because	you	actually	can	do	that	,	you	can	go	in	and	attack	other	intelligent	races	.
you	might	be	a	networking	god	,	building	alliances	,	which	you	can	also	do	in	the	game	,	or	just	curious	,	going	around	and	wanting	to	explore	as	much	as	you	possibly	can	.
but	basically	,	the	reason	why	i	make	toys	like	this	is	because	i	think	if	there	's	one	difference	i	could	possibly	make	in	the	world	,	that	i	would	choose	to	make	,	it	's	that	i	would	like	to	somehow	give	people	just	a	little	bit	better	calibration	on	long	-	term	thinking	.
because	i	think	most	of	the	problems	that	our	world	is	facing	right	now	is	the	result	of	short	-	term	thinking	,	and	the	fact	that	it	is	so	hard	for	us	to	think	50	,	100	,	or	1,000	years	out	.
and	i	think	by	giving	kids	toys	like	this	and	letting	them	replay	dynamics	,	very	long	-	term	dynamics	over	the	short	term	,	and	getting	some	sense	of	what	we	're	doing	now	,	what	it	's	going	to	be	like	in	100	years	,	i	think	probably	is	the	most	effective	thing	i	can	be	doing	to	help	the	world	.
and	so	that	's	why	i	think	,	personally	,	that	toys	can	change	the	world	.
thank	you	.
