a	few	years	ago	,	i	felt	like	i	was	stuck	in	a	rut	,	so	i	decided	to	follow	in	the	footsteps	of	the	great	american	philosopher	,	morgan	spurlock	,	and	try	something	new	for	30	days	.
the	idea	is	actually	pretty	simple	.
think	about	something	you	've	always	wanted	to	add	to	your	life	and	try	it	for	the	next	30	days	.
it	turns	out	,	30	days	is	just	about	the	right	amount	of	time	to	add	a	new	habit	or	subtract	a	habit	--	like	watching	the	news	--	from	your	life	.
there	's	a	few	things	i	learned	while	doing	these	30	-	day	challenges	.
the	first	was	,	instead	of	the	months	flying	by	,	forgotten	,	the	time	was	much	more	memorable	.
this	was	part	of	a	challenge	i	did	to	take	a	picture	every	day	for	a	month	.
and	i	remember	exactly	where	i	was	and	what	i	was	doing	that	day	.
i	also	noticed	that	as	i	started	to	do	more	and	harder	30	-	day	challenges	,	my	self	-	confidence	grew	.
i	went	from	desk	-	dwelling	computer	nerd	to	the	kind	of	guy	who	bikes	to	work	--	even	last	year	,	i	ended	up	hiking	up	mt	.	kilimanjaro	,	the	highest	mountain	in	africa	.
i	would	never	have	been	that	adventurous	before	i	started	my	30	-	day	challenges	.
i	also	figured	out	that	if	you	really	want	something	badly	enough	,	you	can	do	anything	for	30	days	.
have	you	ever	wanted	to	write	a	novel	?
every	november	,	tens	of	thousands	of	people	try	to	write	their	own	50,000	-	word	novel	from	scratch	in	30	days	.
it	turns	out	,	all	you	have	to	do	is	write	1,667	words	a	day	for	a	month	.
so	i	did	.
by	the	way	,	the	secret	is	not	to	go	to	sleep	until	you	've	written	your	words	for	the	day	.
you	might	be	sleep	-	deprived	,	but	you	'll	finish	your	novel	.
now	is	my	book	the	next	great	american	novel	?
no	.	i	wrote	it	in	a	month	.
it	's	awful	.
but	for	the	rest	of	my	life	,	if	i	meet	john	hodgman	at	a	ted	party	,	i	do	n't	have	to	say	,	``	i	'm	a	computer	scientist	.	``
no	,	no	,	if	i	want	to	,	i	can	say	,	``	i	'm	a	novelist	.	``
so	here	's	one	last	thing	i	'd	like	to	mention	.
i	learned	that	when	i	made	small	,	sustainable	changes	,	things	i	could	keep	doing	,	they	were	more	likely	to	stick	.
there	's	nothing	wrong	with	big	,	crazy	challenges	.
in	fact	,	they	're	a	ton	of	fun	.
but	they	're	less	likely	to	stick	.
when	i	gave	up	sugar	for	30	days	,	day	31	looked	like	this	.
so	here	's	my	question	to	you	:	what	are	you	waiting	for	?
i	guarantee	you	the	next	30	days	are	going	to	pass	whether	you	like	it	or	not	,	so	why	not	think	about	something	you	have	always	wanted	to	try	and	give	it	a	shot	for	the	next	30	days	.
thanks	.
