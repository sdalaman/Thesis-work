i	have	all	my	life	wondered	what	``	mind	-	boggling	``	meant	.
after	two	days	here	,	i	declare	myself	boggled	,	and	enormously	impressed	,	and	feel	that	you	are	one	of	the	great	hopes	--	not	just	for	american	achievement	in	science	and	technology	,	but	for	the	whole	world	.
i	've	come	,	however	,	on	a	special	mission	on	behalf	of	my	constituency	,	which	are	the	10	-	to	-	the	-	18th	-	power	--	that	's	a	million	trillion	--	insects	and	other	small	creatures	,	and	to	make	a	plea	for	them	.
if	we	were	to	wipe	out	insects	alone	,	just	that	group	alone	,	on	this	planet	--	which	we	are	trying	hard	to	do	--	the	rest	of	life	and	humanity	with	it	would	mostly	disappear	from	the	land	.
and	within	a	few	months	.
now	,	how	did	i	come	to	this	particular	position	of	advocacy	?
as	a	little	boy	,	and	through	my	teenage	years	,	i	became	increasingly	fascinated	by	the	diversity	of	life	.
i	had	a	butterfly	period	,	a	snake	period	,	a	bird	period	,	a	fish	period	,	a	cave	period	and	finally	and	definitively	,	an	ant	period	.
by	my	college	years	,	i	was	a	devoted	myrmecologist	,	a	specialist	on	the	biology	of	ants	,	but	my	attention	and	research	continued	to	make	journeys	across	the	great	variety	of	life	on	earth	in	general	--	including	all	that	it	means	to	us	as	a	species	,	how	little	we	understand	it	and	how	pressing	a	danger	that	our	activities	have	created	for	it	.
out	of	that	broader	study	has	emerged	a	concern	and	an	ambition	,	crystallized	in	the	wish	that	i	'm	about	to	make	to	you	.
my	choice	is	the	culmination	of	a	lifetime	commitment	that	began	with	growing	up	on	the	gulf	coast	of	alabama	,	on	the	florida	peninsula	.
as	far	back	as	i	can	remember	,	i	was	enchanted	by	the	natural	beauty	of	that	region	and	the	almost	tropical	exuberance	of	the	plants	and	animals	that	grow	there	.
one	day	when	i	was	only	seven	years	old	and	fishing	,	i	pulled	a	``	pinfish	,	``	they	're	called	,	with	sharp	dorsal	spines	,	up	too	hard	and	fast	,	and	i	blinded	myself	in	one	eye	.
i	later	discovered	i	was	also	hard	of	hearing	,	possibly	congenitally	,	in	the	upper	registers	.
so	in	planning	to	be	a	professional	naturalist	--	i	never	considered	anything	else	in	my	entire	life	--	i	found	that	i	was	lousy	at	bird	watching	and	could	n't	track	frog	calls	either	.
so	i	turned	to	the	teeming	small	creatures	that	can	be	held	between	the	thumb	and	forefinger	:	the	little	things	that	compose	the	foundation	of	our	ecosystems	,	the	little	things	,	as	i	like	to	say	,	who	run	the	world	.
in	so	doing	,	i	reached	a	frontier	of	biology	so	strange	,	so	rich	,	that	it	seemed	as	though	it	exists	on	another	planet	.
in	fact	,	we	live	on	a	mostly	unexplored	planet	.
the	great	majority	of	organisms	on	earth	remain	unknown	to	science	.
in	the	last	30	years	,	thanks	to	explorations	in	remote	parts	of	the	world	and	advances	in	technology	,	biologists	have	,	for	example	,	added	a	full	one	-	third	of	the	known	frog	and	other	amphibian	species	,	to	bring	the	current	total	to	5,400	,	and	more	continue	to	pour	in	.
two	new	kinds	of	whales	have	been	discovered	,	along	with	two	new	antelopes	,	dozens	of	monkey	species	and	a	new	kind	of	elephant	--	and	even	a	distinct	kind	of	gorilla	.
at	the	extreme	opposite	end	of	the	size	scale	,	the	class	of	marine	bacteria	,	the	prochlorococci	--	that	will	be	on	the	final	exam	--	although	discovered	only	in	1988	,	are	now	recognized	as	likely	the	most	abundant	organisms	on	earth	,	and	moreover	,	responsible	for	a	large	part	of	the	photosynthesis	that	occurs	in	the	ocean	.
these	bacteria	were	not	uncovered	sooner	because	they	are	also	among	the	smallest	of	all	earth	's	organisms	--	so	minute	that	they	can	not	be	seen	with	conventional	optical	microscopy	.
yet	life	in	the	sea	may	depend	on	these	tiny	creatures	.
these	examples	are	just	the	first	glimpse	of	our	ignorance	of	life	on	this	planet	.
consider	the	fungi	--	including	mushrooms	,	rusts	,	molds	and	many	disease	-	causing	organisms	.
60,000	species	are	known	to	science	,	but	more	than	1.5	million	have	been	estimated	to	exist	.
consider	the	nematode	roundworm	,	the	most	abundant	of	all	animals	.
four	out	of	five	animals	on	earth	are	nematode	worms	--	if	all	solid	materials	except	nematode	worms	were	to	be	eliminated	,	you	could	still	see	the	ghostly	outline	of	most	of	it	in	nematode	worms	.
about	16,000	species	of	nematode	worms	have	been	discovered	and	diagnosed	by	scientists	;	there	could	be	hundreds	of	thousands	of	them	,	even	millions	,	still	unknown	.
this	vast	domain	of	hidden	biodiversity	is	increased	still	further	by	the	dark	matter	of	the	biological	world	of	bacteria	,	which	within	just	the	last	several	years	still	were	known	from	only	about	6,000	species	of	bacteria	worldwide	.
but	that	number	of	bacteria	species	can	be	found	in	one	gram	of	soil	,	just	a	little	handful	of	soil	,	in	the	10	billion	bacteria	that	would	be	there	.
it	's	been	estimated	that	a	single	ton	of	soil	--	fertile	soil	--	contains	approximately	four	million	species	of	bacteria	,	all	unknown	.
so	the	question	is	:	what	are	they	all	doing	?
the	fact	is	,	we	do	n't	know	.
we	are	living	on	a	planet	with	a	lot	of	activities	,	with	reference	to	our	living	environment	,	done	by	faith	and	guess	alone	.
our	lives	depend	upon	these	creatures	.
to	take	an	example	close	to	home	:	there	are	over	500	species	of	bacteria	now	known	--	friendly	bacteria	--	living	symbiotically	in	your	mouth	and	throat	probably	necessary	to	your	health	for	holding	off	pathogenic	bacteria	.
at	this	point	i	think	we	have	a	little	impressionistic	film	that	was	made	especially	for	this	occasion	.
and	i	'd	like	to	show	it	.
assisted	in	this	by	billie	holiday	.
and	that	may	be	just	the	beginning	!
the	viruses	,	those	quasi	-	organisms	among	which	are	the	prophages	,	the	gene	weavers	that	promote	the	continued	evolution	in	the	lives	of	the	bacteria	,	are	a	virtually	unknown	frontier	of	modern	biology	,	a	world	unto	themselves	.
what	constitutes	a	viral	species	is	still	unresolved	,	although	they	're	obviously	of	enormous	importance	to	us	.
but	this	much	we	can	say	:	the	variety	of	genes	on	the	planet	in	viruses	exceeds	,	or	is	likely	to	exceed	,	that	in	all	of	the	rest	of	life	combined	.
nowadays	,	in	addressing	microbial	biodiversity	,	scientists	are	like	explorers	in	a	rowboat	launched	onto	the	pacific	ocean	.
but	that	is	changing	rapidly	with	the	aid	of	new	genomic	technology	.
already	it	is	possible	to	sequence	the	entire	genetic	code	of	a	bacterium	in	under	four	hours	.
soon	we	will	be	in	a	position	to	go	forth	in	the	field	with	sequencers	on	our	backs	--	to	hunt	bacteria	in	tiny	crevices	of	the	habitat	's	surface	in	the	way	you	go	watching	for	birds	with	binoculars	.
what	will	we	find	as	we	map	the	living	world	,	as	,	finally	,	we	get	this	underway	seriously	?
as	we	move	past	the	relatively	gigantic	mammals	,	birds	,	frogs	and	plants	to	the	more	elusive	insects	and	other	small	invertebrates	and	then	beyond	to	the	countless	millions	of	organisms	in	the	invisible	living	world	enveloped	and	living	within	humanity	?
already	what	were	thought	to	be	bacteria	for	generations	have	been	found	to	compose	,	instead	,	two	great	domains	of	microorganisms	:	true	bacteria	and	one	-	celled	organisms	the	archaea	,	which	are	closer	than	other	bacteria	to	the	eukaryota	,	the	group	that	we	belong	to	.
some	serious	biologists	,	and	i	count	myself	among	them	,	have	begun	to	wonder	that	among	the	enormous	and	still	unknown	diversity	of	microorganisms	,	one	might	--	just	might	--	find	aliens	among	them	.
true	aliens	,	stocks	that	arrived	from	outer	space	.
they	've	had	billions	of	years	to	do	it	,	but	especially	during	the	earliest	period	of	biological	evolution	on	this	planet	.
we	do	know	that	some	bacterial	species	that	have	earthly	origin	are	capable	of	almost	unimaginable	extremes	of	temperature	and	other	harsh	changes	in	environment	,	including	hard	radiation	strong	enough	and	maintained	long	enough	to	crack	the	pyrex	vessels	around	the	growing	population	of	bacteria	.
there	may	be	a	temptation	to	treat	the	biosphere	holistically	and	the	species	that	compose	it	as	a	great	flux	of	entities	hardly	worth	distinguishing	one	from	the	other	.
but	each	of	these	species	,	even	the	tiniest	prochlorococci	,	are	masterpieces	of	evolution	.
each	has	persisted	for	thousands	to	millions	of	years	.
each	is	exquisitely	adapted	to	the	environment	in	which	it	lives	,	interlocked	with	other	species	to	form	ecosystems	upon	which	our	own	lives	depend	in	ways	we	have	not	begun	even	to	imagine	.
we	will	destroy	these	ecosystems	and	the	species	composing	them	at	the	peril	of	our	own	existence	--	and	unfortunately	we	are	destroying	them	with	ingenuity	and	ceaseless	energy	.
my	own	epiphany	as	a	conservationist	came	in	1953	,	while	a	harvard	graduate	student	,	searching	for	rare	ants	found	in	the	mountain	forests	of	cuba	,	ants	that	shine	in	the	sunlight	--	metallic	green	or	metallic	blue	,	according	to	species	,	and	one	species	,	i	discovered	,	metallic	gold	.
i	found	my	magical	ants	,	but	only	after	a	tough	climb	into	the	mountains	where	the	last	of	the	native	cuban	forests	hung	on	,	and	were	then	--	and	still	are	--	being	cut	back	.
i	realized	then	that	these	species	and	a	large	part	of	the	other	unique	,	marvelous	animals	and	plants	on	that	island	--	and	this	is	true	of	practically	every	part	of	the	world	--	which	took	millions	of	years	to	evolve	,	are	in	the	process	of	disappearing	forever	.
and	so	it	is	everywhere	one	looks	.
the	human	juggernaut	is	permanently	eroding	earth	's	ancient	biosphere	by	a	combination	of	forces	that	can	be	summarized	by	the	acronym	``	hippo	,	``	the	animal	hippo	.
h	is	for	habitat	destruction	,	including	climate	change	forced	by	greenhouse	gases	.
i	is	for	the	invasive	species	like	the	fire	ants	,	the	zebra	mussels	,	broom	grasses	and	pathogenic	bacteria	and	viruses	that	are	flooding	every	country	,	and	at	an	exponential	rate	--	that	's	the	i	.
the	p	,	the	first	one	in	``	hippo	,	``	is	for	pollution	.
the	second	is	for	continued	population	,	human	population	expansion	.
and	the	final	letter	is	o	,	for	over	-	harvesting	--	driving	species	into	extinction	by	excessive	hunting	and	fishing	.
the	hippo	juggernaut	we	have	created	,	if	unabated	,	is	destined	--	according	to	the	best	estimates	of	ongoing	biodiversity	research	--	to	reduce	half	of	earth	's	still	surviving	animal	and	plant	species	to	extinction	or	critical	endangerment	by	the	end	of	the	century	.
human	-	forced	climate	change	alone	--	again	,	if	unabated	--	could	eliminate	a	quarter	of	surviving	species	during	the	next	five	decades	.
what	will	we	and	all	future	generations	lose	if	much	of	the	living	environment	is	thus	degraded	?
huge	potential	sources	of	scientific	information	yet	to	be	gathered	,	much	of	our	environmental	stability	and	new	kinds	of	pharmaceuticals	and	new	products	of	unimaginable	strength	and	value	--	all	thrown	away	.
the	loss	will	inflict	a	heavy	price	in	wealth	,	security	and	yes	,	spirituality	for	all	time	to	come	,	because	previous	cataclysms	of	this	kind	--	the	last	one	,	that	ended	the	age	of	dinosaurs	--	took	,	normally	,	five	to	10	million	years	to	repair	.
sadly	,	our	knowledge	of	biodiversity	is	so	incomplete	that	we	are	at	risk	of	losing	a	great	deal	of	it	before	it	is	even	discovered	.
for	example	,	even	in	the	united	states	,	the	200,000	species	known	currently	actually	has	been	found	to	be	only	partial	in	coverage	;	it	is	mostly	unknown	to	us	in	basic	biology	.
only	about	15	percent	of	the	known	species	have	been	studied	well	enough	to	evaluate	their	status	.
of	the	15	percent	evaluated	,	20	percent	are	classified	as	``	in	peril	,	``	that	is	,	in	danger	of	extinction	.
that	's	in	the	united	states	.
we	are	,	in	short	,	flying	blind	into	our	environmental	future	.
we	urgently	need	to	change	this	.
we	need	to	have	the	biosphere	properly	explored	so	that	we	can	understand	and	competently	manage	it	.
we	need	to	settle	down	before	we	wreck	the	planet	.
and	we	need	that	knowledge	.
this	should	be	a	big	science	project	equivalent	to	the	human	genome	project	.
it	should	be	thought	of	as	a	biological	moonshot	with	a	timetable	.
so	this	brings	me	to	my	wish	for	tedsters	,	and	to	anyone	else	around	the	world	who	hears	this	talk	.
i	wish	we	will	work	together	to	help	create	the	key	tools	that	we	need	to	inspire	preservation	of	earth	's	biodiversity	.
and	let	us	call	it	the	``	encyclopedia	of	life	.	``
what	is	the	``	encyclopedia	of	life	?	``	a	concept	that	has	already	taken	hold	and	is	beginning	to	spread	and	be	looked	at	seriously	?
it	is	an	encyclopedia	that	lives	on	the	internet	and	is	contributed	to	by	thousands	of	scientists	around	the	world	.
amateurs	can	do	it	also	.
it	has	an	indefinitely	expandable	page	for	each	species	.
it	makes	all	key	information	about	life	on	earth	accessible	to	anyone	,	on	demand	,	anywhere	in	the	world	.
i	've	written	about	this	idea	before	,	and	i	know	there	are	people	in	this	room	who	have	expended	significant	effort	on	it	in	the	past	.
but	what	excites	me	is	that	since	i	first	put	forward	this	particular	idea	in	that	form	,	science	has	advanced	.
technology	has	moved	forward	.
today	,	the	practicalities	of	making	such	an	encyclopedia	,	regardless	of	the	magnitude	of	the	information	put	into	it	,	are	within	reach	.
indeed	,	in	the	past	year	,	a	group	of	influential	scientific	institutions	have	begun	mobilizing	to	realize	this	dream	.
i	wish	you	would	help	them	.
working	together	,	we	can	make	this	real	.
the	encyclopedia	will	quickly	pay	for	itself	in	practical	applications	.
it	will	address	transcendent	qualities	in	the	human	consciousness	,	and	sense	of	human	need	.
it	will	transform	the	science	of	biology	in	ways	of	obvious	benefit	to	humanity	.
and	most	of	all	,	it	can	inspire	a	new	generation	of	biologists	to	continue	the	quest	that	started	,	for	me	personally	,	60	years	ago	:	to	search	for	life	,	to	understand	it	and	finally	,	above	all	,	to	preserve	it	.
that	is	my	wish	.	thank	you	.
