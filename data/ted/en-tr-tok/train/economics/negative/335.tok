my	mission	in	life	since	i	was	a	kid	was	,	and	is	,	to	take	the	rest	of	you	into	space	.
it	's	during	our	lifetime	that	we	're	going	to	take	the	earth	,	take	the	people	of	earth	and	transition	off	,	permanently	.	and	that	's	exciting	.
in	fact	,	i	think	it	is	a	moral	imperative	that	we	open	the	space	frontier	.
you	know	,	it	's	the	first	time	that	we	're	going	to	have	a	chance	to	have	planetary	redundancy	,	a	chance	to	,	if	you	would	,	back	up	the	biosphere	.
and	if	you	think	about	space	,	everything	we	hold	of	value	on	this	planet	--	metals	and	minerals	and	real	estate	and	energy	--	is	in	infinite	quantities	in	space	.
in	fact	,	the	earth	is	a	crumb	in	a	supermarket	filled	with	resources	.
the	analogy	for	me	is	alaska	.	you	know	,	we	bought	alaska	.
we	americans	bought	alaska	in	the	1850s	.	it	's	called	seward	's	folly	.
we	valued	it	as	the	number	of	seal	pelts	we	could	kill	.
and	then	we	discovered	these	things	--	gold	and	oil	and	fishing	and	timber	--	and	it	became	,	you	know	,	a	trillion	-	dollar	economy	,	and	now	we	take	our	honeymoons	there	.	the	same	thing	will	happen	in	space	.
we	are	on	the	verge	of	the	greatest	exploration	that	the	human	race	has	ever	known	.
we	explore	for	three	reasons	,	the	weakest	of	which	is	curiosity	.
you	know	,	it	's	funded	nasa	's	budget	up	until	now	.
some	images	from	mars	,	1997	.
in	fact	,	i	think	in	the	next	decade	,	without	any	question	,	we	will	discover	life	on	mars	and	find	that	it	is	literally	ubiquitous	under	the	soils	and	different	parts	of	that	planet	.
the	stronger	motivator	,	the	much	stronger	motivator	,	is	fear	.
it	drove	us	to	the	moon	.	we	--	literally	in	fear	--	with	the	soviet	union	raced	to	the	moon	.	and	we	have	these	huge	rocks	,	you	know	,	killer	-	sized	rocks	in	the	hundreds	of	thousands	or	millions	out	there	,	and	while	the	probability	is	very	small	,	the	impact	,	figured	in	literally	,	of	one	of	these	hitting	the	earth	is	so	huge	that	to	spend	a	small	fraction	looking	,	searching	,	preparing	to	defend	,	is	not	unreasonable	.
and	of	course	,	the	third	motivator	,	one	near	and	dear	to	my	heart	as	an	entrepreneur	,	is	wealth	.
in	fact	,	the	greatest	wealth	.	if	you	think	about	these	other	asteroids	,	there	's	a	class	of	the	nickel	iron	,	which	in	platinum	-	group	metal	markets	alone	are	worth	something	like	20	trillion	dollars	,	if	you	can	go	out	and	grab	one	of	these	rocks	.
my	plan	is	to	actually	buy	puts	on	the	precious	metal	market	,	and	then	actually	claim	that	i	'm	going	to	go	out	and	get	one	.
and	that	will	fund	the	actual	mission	to	go	and	get	one	.
but	fear	,	curiosity	and	greed	have	driven	us	.
and	for	me	,	this	is	--	i	'm	the	short	kid	on	the	right	.
this	was	--	my	motivation	was	actually	during	apollo	.
and	apollo	was	one	of	the	greatest	motivators	ever	.
if	you	think	about	what	happened	at	the	turn	of	--	early	1960s	,	on	may	25	,	jfk	said	,	``	we	're	going	to	go	to	the	moon	.	``
and	people	left	their	jobs	and	they	went	to	obscure	locations	to	go	and	be	part	of	this	amazing	mission	.
and	we	knew	nothing	about	going	to	space	.
we	went	from	having	literally	put	alan	shepard	in	suborbital	flight	to	going	to	the	moon	in	eight	years	,	and	the	average	age	of	the	people	that	got	us	there	was	26	years	old	.
they	did	n't	know	what	could	n't	be	done	.
they	had	to	make	up	everything	.
and	that	,	my	friend	,	is	amazing	motivation	.
this	is	gene	cernan	,	a	good	friend	of	mine	,	saying	,	``	if	i	can	go	to	the	moon	``	--	this	is	the	last	human	on	the	moon	so	far	--	``	nothing	,	nothing	is	impossible	.	``	but	of	course	,	we	've	thought	about	the	government	always	as	the	person	taking	us	there	.
but	i	put	forward	here	,	the	government	is	not	going	to	get	us	there	.
the	government	is	unable	to	take	the	risks	required	to	open	up	this	precious	frontier	.
the	shuttle	is	costing	a	billion	dollars	a	launch	.
that	's	a	pathetic	number	.	it	's	unreasonable	.
we	should	n't	be	happy	in	standing	for	that	.
one	of	the	things	that	we	did	with	the	ansari	x	prize	was	take	the	challenge	on	that	risk	is	ok	,	you	know	.
as	we	are	going	out	there	and	taking	on	a	new	frontier	,	we	should	be	allowed	to	risk	.
in	fact	,	anyone	who	says	we	should	n't	,	you	know	,	just	needs	to	be	put	aside	,	because	,	as	we	go	forward	,	in	fact	,	the	greatest	discoveries	we	will	ever	know	is	ahead	of	us	.
the	entrepreneurs	in	the	space	business	are	the	furry	mammals	,	and	clearly	the	industrial	-	military	complex	--	with	boeing	and	lockheed	and	nasa	--	are	the	dinosaurs	.
the	ability	for	us	to	access	these	resources	to	gain	planetary	redundancy	--	we	can	now	gather	all	the	information	,	the	genetic	codes	,	you	know	,	everything	stored	on	our	databases	,	and	back	them	up	off	the	planet	,	in	case	there	would	be	one	of	those	disastrous	situations	.
the	difficulty	is	getting	there	,	and	clearly	,	the	cost	to	orbit	is	key	.
once	you	're	in	orbit	,	you	are	two	thirds	of	the	way	,	energetically	,	to	anywhere	--	the	moon	,	to	mars	.	and	today	,	there	's	only	three	vehicles	--	the	u.s.	shuttle	,	the	russian	soyuz	and	the	chinese	vehicle	--	that	gets	you	there	.
arguably	,	it	's	about	100	million	dollars	a	person	on	the	space	shuttle	.
one	of	the	companies	i	started	,	space	adventures	,	will	sell	you	a	ticket	.
we	've	done	two	so	far	.	we	'll	be	announcing	two	more	on	the	soyuz	to	go	up	to	the	space	station	for	20	million	dollars	.
but	that	's	expensive	and	to	understand	what	the	potential	is	--	--	it	is	expensive	.	but	people	are	willing	to	pay	that	!
you	know	,	one	--	we	have	a	very	unique	period	in	time	today	.
for	the	first	time	ever	,	we	have	enough	wealth	concentrated	in	the	hands	of	few	individuals	and	the	technology	accessible	that	will	allow	us	to	really	drive	space	exploration	.
but	how	cheap	could	it	get	?	i	want	to	give	you	the	end	point	.
we	know	--	20	million	dollars	today	,	you	can	go	and	buy	a	ticket	,	but	how	cheap	could	it	get	?
let	's	go	back	to	high	school	physics	here	.
if	you	calculate	the	amount	of	potential	energy	,	mgh	,	to	take	you	and	your	spacesuit	up	to	a	couple	hundred	miles	,	and	then	you	accelerate	yourself	to	17,500	miles	per	hour	--	remember	,	that	one	half	mv	squared	--	and	you	figure	it	out	.
it	's	about	5.7	gigajoules	of	energy	.
if	you	expended	that	over	an	hour	,	it	's	about	1.6	megawatts	.
if	you	go	to	one	of	vijay	's	micro	-	power	sources	,	and	they	sell	it	to	you	for	seven	cents	a	kilowatt	hour	--	anybody	here	fast	in	math	?
how	much	will	it	cost	you	and	your	spacesuit	to	go	to	orbit	?
100	bucks	.	that	's	the	price	-	improvement	curve	that	--	we	need	some	breakthroughs	in	physics	along	the	way	,	i	'll	grant	you	that	.
but	guys	,	if	history	has	taught	us	anything	,	it	's	that	if	you	can	imagine	it	,	you	will	get	there	eventually	.
i	have	no	question	that	the	physics	,	the	engineering	to	get	us	down	to	the	point	where	all	of	us	can	afford	orbital	space	flight	is	around	the	corner	.
the	difficulty	is	that	there	needs	to	be	a	real	marketplace	to	drive	the	investment	.
today	,	the	boeings	and	the	lockheeds	do	n't	spend	a	dollar	of	their	own	money	in	r	&	d	.
it	's	all	government	research	dollars	,	and	very	few	of	those	.
and	in	fact	,	the	large	corporations	,	the	governments	,	ca	n't	take	the	risk	.
so	we	need	what	i	call	an	exothermic	economic	reaction	in	space	.
today	's	commercial	markets	worldwide	,	global	commercial	launch	market	?
12	to	15	launches	per	year	.
number	of	commercial	companies	out	there	?	12	to	15	companies	.
one	per	company	.	that	's	not	it	.	there	's	only	one	marketplace	,	and	i	call	them	self	-	loading	carbon	payloads	.
they	come	with	their	own	money	.	they	're	easy	to	make	.
it	's	people	.	the	ansari	x	prize	was	my	solution	,	reading	about	lindbergh	for	creating	the	vehicles	to	get	us	there	.
we	offered	10	million	dollars	in	cash	for	the	first	reusable	ship	,	carry	three	people	up	to	100	kilometers	,	come	back	down	,	and	within	two	weeks	,	make	the	trip	again	.
twenty	-	six	teams	from	seven	countries	entered	the	competition	,	spending	between	one	to	25	million	dollars	each	.
and	of	course	,	we	had	beautiful	spaceshipone	,	which	made	those	two	flights	and	won	the	competition	.
and	i	'd	like	to	take	you	there	,	to	that	morning	,	for	just	a	quick	video	.
pilot	:	release	our	fire	.
richard	searfoss	:	good	luck	.
rs	:	we	've	got	an	altitude	call	of	368,000	feet	.
rs	:	so	in	my	official	capacity	as	the	chief	judge	of	the	ansari	x	prize	competition	,	i	declare	that	mojave	aerospace	ventures	has	indeed	earned	the	ansari	x	prize	.
peter	diamandis	:	probably	the	most	difficult	thing	that	i	had	to	do	was	raise	the	capital	for	this	.	it	was	literally	impossible	.
we	went	--	i	went	to	100	,	200	ceos	,	cmos	.
no	one	believed	it	was	done	.	everyone	said	,	``	oh	,	what	does	nasa	think	?
well	,	people	are	going	to	die	,	how	can	you	possibly	going	to	put	this	forward	?	``
i	found	a	visionary	family	,	the	ansari	family	,	and	champ	car	,	and	raised	part	of	the	money	,	but	not	the	full	10	million	.
and	what	i	ended	up	doing	was	going	out	to	the	insurance	industry	and	buying	a	hole	-	in	-	one	insurance	policy	.
see	,	the	insurance	companies	went	to	boeing	and	lockheed	,	and	said	,	``	are	you	going	to	compete	?	``	no	.
``	are	you	going	to	compete	?	``	no.	``	no	one	's	going	to	win	this	thing	.	``
so	,	they	took	a	bet	that	no	one	would	win	by	january	of	'05	,	and	i	took	a	bet	that	someone	would	win	.
so	--	and	the	best	thing	is	they	paid	off	and	the	check	did	n't	bounce	.
we	've	had	a	lot	of	accomplishments	and	it	's	been	a	tremendous	success	.
one	of	the	things	i	'm	most	happy	about	is	that	the	spaceshipone	is	going	to	hang	in	air	and	space	museum	,	next	to	the	spirit	of	st.	louis	and	the	wright	flyer	.
is	n't	that	great	?
so	a	little	bit	about	the	future	,	steps	to	space	,	what	's	available	for	you	.
today	,	you	can	go	and	experience	weightless	flights	.
by	'08	,	suborbital	flights	,	the	price	tag	for	that	,	you	know	,	on	virgin	,	is	going	to	be	about	200,000	.
there	are	three	or	four	other	serious	efforts	that	will	bring	the	price	down	very	rapidly	,	i	think	,	to	about	25,000	dollars	for	a	suborbital	flight	.
orbital	flights	--	we	can	take	you	to	the	space	station	.
and	then	i	truly	believe	,	once	a	group	is	in	orbit	around	the	earth	--	i	know	if	they	do	n't	do	it	,	i	am	--	we	're	going	to	stockpile	some	fuel	,	make	a	beeline	for	the	moon	and	grab	some	real	estate	.
quick	moment	for	the	designers	in	the	audience	.
we	spent	11	years	getting	faa	approval	to	do	zero	gravity	flights	.
here	are	some	fun	images	.	here	's	burt	rutan	and	my	good	friend	greg	meronek	inside	a	zero	gravity	--	people	think	a	zero	gravity	room	,	there	's	a	switch	on	there	that	turns	it	off	--	but	it	's	actually	parabolic	flight	of	an	airplane	.
and	turns	out	7	-	up	has	just	done	a	little	commercial	that	's	airing	this	month	.
if	we	can	get	the	audio	up	?
narrator	:	for	a	chance	to	win	the	first	free	ticket	to	space	,	look	for	specially	marked	packages	of	diet	7	-	up	.
when	you	want	the	taste	that	wo	n't	weigh	you	down	,	the	only	way	to	go	is	up	.
pd	:	that	was	filmed	inside	our	airplane	,	and	so	,	you	can	now	do	this	.
we	're	based	down	in	florida	.
let	me	talk	about	the	other	thing	i	'm	excited	about	.
the	future	of	prizes	.	you	know	,	prizes	are	a	very	old	idea	.
i	had	the	pleasure	of	borrowing	from	the	longitude	prize	and	the	orteig	prize	that	put	lindbergh	forward	.
and	we	have	made	a	decision	in	the	x	prize	foundation	to	actually	carry	that	concept	forward	into	other	technology	areas	,	and	we	just	took	on	a	new	mission	statement	:	``	to	bring	about	radical	breakthroughs	in	space	and	other	technologies	for	the	benefit	of	humanity	.	``
and	this	is	something	that	we	're	very	excited	about	.
i	showed	this	slide	to	larry	page	,	who	just	joined	our	board	.
and	you	know	,	when	you	give	to	a	nonprofit	,	you	might	have	50	cents	on	the	dollar	.
if	you	have	a	matching	grant	,	it	's	typically	two	or	three	to	one	.
if	you	put	up	a	prize	,	you	can	get	literally	a	50	to	one	leverage	on	your	dollars	.
and	that	's	huge	.	and	then	he	turned	around	and	said	,	``	well	,	if	you	back	a	prize	institute	that	runs	a	10	prize	,	you	get	500	to	one	.	``
i	said	,	``	well	,	that	's	great	.	``
so	,	we	have	actually	--	are	looking	to	turn	the	x	prize	into	a	world	-	class	prize	institute	.
this	is	what	happens	when	you	put	up	a	prize	,	when	you	announce	it	and	teams	start	to	begin	doing	trials	.
you	get	publicity	increase	,	and	when	it	's	won	,	publicity	shoots	through	the	roof	--	if	it	's	properly	managed	--	and	that	's	part	of	the	benefits	to	a	sponsor	.
then	,	when	the	prize	is	actually	won	,	after	it	's	moving	,	you	get	societal	benefits	,	you	know	,	new	technology	,	new	capability	.
and	the	benefit	to	the	sponsors	is	the	sum	of	the	publicity	and	societal	benefits	over	the	long	term	.
that	's	our	value	proposition	in	a	prize	.
if	you	were	going	to	go	and	try	to	create	spaceshipone	,	or	any	kind	of	a	new	technology	,	you	have	to	fund	that	from	the	beginning	and	maintain	that	funding	with	an	uncertain	outcome	.
it	may	or	may	not	happen	.	but	if	you	put	up	a	prize	,	the	beautiful	thing	is	,	you	know	,	it	's	a	very	small	maintenance	fee	,	and	you	pay	on	success	.
orteig	did	n't	pay	a	dime	out	to	the	nine	teams	that	went	across	--	tried	to	go	across	the	atlantic	,	and	we	did	n't	pay	a	dime	until	someone	won	the	ansari	x	prize	.
so	,	prizes	work	great	.
you	know	,	innovators	,	the	entrepreneurs	out	there	,	you	know	that	when	you	're	going	for	a	goal	,	the	first	thing	you	have	to	do	is	believe	that	you	can	do	it	yourself	.
then	,	you	've	got	to	,	you	know	,	face	potential	public	ridicule	of	--	that	's	a	crazy	idea	,	it	'll	never	work	.
and	then	you	have	to	convince	others	,	so	that	they	can	,	in	fact	,	help	you	raise	the	funds	,	and	then	you	've	got	to	deal	with	the	fact	that	you	've	got	government	bureaucracies	and	institutions	that	do	n't	want	you	to	move	those	things	forward	,	and	you	have	to	deal	with	failures	.	what	a	prize	does	,	what	we	've	experienced	a	prize	doing	,	is	literally	help	to	short	-	circuit	or	support	all	of	these	things	,	because	a	prize	credentials	the	idea	that	this	is	a	good	idea	.
well	,	it	must	be	a	good	idea	.
someone	's	offering	10	million	dollars	to	go	and	do	this	thing	.
and	each	of	these	areas	was	something	that	we	found	the	ansari	x	prize	helped	short	-	circuit	these	for	innovation	.
so	,	as	an	organization	,	we	put	together	a	prize	discovery	process	of	how	to	come	up	with	prizes	and	write	the	rules	,	and	we	're	actually	looking	at	creating	prizes	in	a	number	of	different	categories	.
we	're	looking	at	attacking	energy	,	environment	,	nanotechnology	--	and	i	'll	talk	about	those	more	in	a	moment	.
and	the	way	we	're	doing	that	is	we	're	creating	prize	teams	within	the	x	prize	.	we	have	a	space	prize	team	.
we	're	going	after	an	orbital	prize	.
we	are	looking	at	a	number	of	energy	prizes	.
craig	venter	has	just	joined	our	board	and	we	're	doing	a	rapid	genome	sequencing	prize	with	him	,	we	'll	be	announcing	later	this	fall	,	about	--	imagine	being	able	to	sequence	anybody	's	dna	for	under	1,000	dollars	,	revolutionize	medicine	.
and	clean	water	,	education	,	medicine	and	even	looking	at	social	entrepreneurship	.
so	my	final	slide	here	is	,	the	most	critical	tool	for	solving	humanity	's	grand	challenges	--	it	is	n't	technology	,	it	is	n't	money	,	it	's	only	one	thing	--	it	's	the	committed	,	passionate	human	mind	.
