ladies	and	gentlemen	,	i	present	to	you	the	human	genome	.
chromosome	one	,	top	left	.
bottom	right	are	the	sex	chromosomes	.
women	have	two	copies	of	that	big	x	chromosome	;	men	have	the	x	and	,	of	course	,	that	small	copy	of	the	y	.
sorry	boys	,	but	it	's	just	a	tiny	little	thing	that	makes	you	different	.
so	if	you	zoom	in	on	this	genome	,	then	what	you	see	,	of	course	,	is	this	double	helix	structure	--	the	code	of	life	spelled	out	with	these	four	biochemical	letters	,	or	we	call	them	bases	,	right	:	a	,	c	,	g	and	t	.
how	many	are	there	in	the	human	genome	?	three	billion	.
is	that	a	big	number	?
well	,	everybody	can	throw	around	big	numbers	.
but	in	fact	,	if	i	were	to	place	one	base	on	each	pixel	of	this	1280	by	800	resolution	screen	,	we	would	need	3,000	screens	to	take	a	look	at	the	genome	.
so	it	's	really	quite	big	.
and	perhaps	because	of	its	size	,	a	group	of	people	--	all	,	by	the	way	,	with	y	chromosomes	--	decided	they	would	want	to	sequence	it	.
and	so	15	years	,	actually	,	and	about	four	billion	dollars	later	,	the	genome	was	sequenced	and	published	.
in	2003	,	the	final	version	was	published	,	and	they	keep	working	on	it	.
that	was	all	done	on	a	machine	that	looks	like	this	.
it	costs	about	a	dollar	for	each	base	--	a	very	slow	way	of	doing	it	.
well	folks	,	i	'm	here	to	tell	you	that	the	world	has	completely	changed	and	none	of	you	know	about	it	.
so	now	what	we	do	is	we	take	a	genome	,	we	make	maybe	50	copies	of	it	,	we	cut	all	those	copies	up	into	little	50	-	base	reads	,	and	then	we	sequence	them	,	massively	parallel	.
and	then	we	bring	that	into	software	,	and	we	reassemble	it	and	we	tell	you	what	the	story	is	.
and	so	just	to	give	you	a	picture	of	what	this	looks	like	,	the	human	genome	project	:	3	gigabases	,	right	.
one	run	on	one	of	these	machines	:	200	gigabases	in	a	week	.
and	that	200	is	going	to	change	to	600	this	summer	,	and	there	's	no	sign	of	this	pace	slowing	.
so	the	price	of	a	base	,	to	sequence	a	base	,	has	fallen	100	million	times	.
that	's	the	equivalent	of	you	filling	up	your	car	with	gas	in	1998	,	waiting	until	2011	,	and	now	you	can	drive	to	jupiter	and	back	twice	.
pc	placements	,	the	archive	of	all	the	medical	literature	,	moore	's	law	,	the	old	way	of	sequencing	,	and	here	's	all	the	new	stuff	.
guys	,	this	is	a	log	scale	;	you	do	n't	typically	see	lines	that	go	up	like	that	.
so	the	worldwide	capacity	to	sequence	human	genomes	is	something	like	50,000	to	100,000	human	genomes	this	year	.
and	we	know	this	based	on	the	machines	that	are	being	placed	.
this	is	expected	to	double	,	triple	or	maybe	quadruple	year	over	year	for	the	foreseeable	future	.
in	fact	,	there	's	one	lab	in	particular	that	represents	20	percent	of	all	that	capacity	.
it	's	called	the	beijing	genomics	institute	.
the	chinese	are	absolutely	winning	this	race	to	the	new	moon	,	by	the	way	.
what	does	this	mean	for	medicine	?
so	a	woman	is	age	37	.
she	presents	with	stage	2	estrogen	receptor	-	positive	breast	cancer	.
she	is	treated	with	surgery	,	chemotherapy	and	radiation	.
she	goes	home	.
two	years	later	,	she	comes	back	with	stage	three	c	ovarian	cancer	.
unfortunately	,	treated	again	with	surgery	and	chemotherapy	.
she	comes	back	three	years	later	at	age	42	with	more	ovarian	cancer	,	more	chemotherapy	.
six	months	later	,	she	comes	back	with	acute	myeloid	leukemia	.
she	goes	into	respiratory	failure	and	dies	eight	days	later	.
so	first	,	the	way	in	which	this	woman	was	treated	,	in	as	little	as	10	years	,	and	it	's	because	of	people	like	my	colleague	,	rick	wilson	,	at	the	genome	institute	at	washington	university	,	who	decided	to	take	a	look	at	this	woman	postmortem	.
and	he	sequenced	,	he	took	skin	cells	,	healthy	skin	,	and	cancerous	bone	marrow	,	and	he	sequenced	the	whole	genomes	of	both	of	them	in	a	couple	of	weeks	,	no	big	deal	.
and	then	he	compared	those	two	genomes	in	software	,	and	what	he	found	,	among	other	things	,	was	a	deletion	,	a	2,000	-	base	deletion	across	three	billion	bases	in	a	particular	gene	called	tp	53	.
if	you	have	this	deleterious	mutation	in	this	gene	,	you	're	90	percent	likely	to	get	cancer	in	your	life	.
so	unfortunately	,	this	does	n't	help	this	woman	,	but	it	does	have	severe	,	profound	if	you	will	,	implications	to	her	family	.
i	mean	,	if	they	have	the	same	mutation	,	and	they	get	this	genetic	test	,	and	they	understand	it	,	then	they	can	go	and	get	regular	screens	,	and	they	can	catch	cancer	early	and	potentially	live	a	significantly	longer	life	.
let	me	introduce	you	now	to	the	beery	twins	,	diagnosed	with	cerebral	palsy	at	the	age	of	two	.
their	mom	is	a	very	brave	woman	who	did	n't	believe	that	the	symptoms	were	n't	matching	up	,	and	through	some	heroic	efforts	and	a	lot	of	internet	searching	,	she	was	able	to	convince	the	medical	community	that	,	in	fact	,	they	had	something	else	.
what	they	had	was	dopa	-	responsive	dystonia	.
and	so	they	were	given	l	-	dopa	,	and	their	symptoms	did	improve	,	but	they	were	n't	totally	asymptomatic	.
significant	problems	remained	.
turns	out	the	gentleman	in	this	picture	is	a	guy	named	joe	beery	,	who	was	lucky	enough	to	be	the	cio	of	a	company	called	life	technologies	.
they	're	one	of	the	two	companies	that	makes	these	massive	whole	genome	sequencing	tools	.
and	so	what	he	did	was	he	got	his	kids	sequenced	.
and	what	they	found	was	a	series	of	mutations	in	a	gene	called	spr	,	which	is	responsible	for	producing	serotonin	,	among	other	things	.
so	on	top	of	l	-	dopa	,	they	gave	these	kids	a	serotonin	precursor	drug	,	and	they	're	effectively	normal	now	.
guys	,	this	would	never	have	happened	without	whole	genome	sequencing	.
and	at	the	time	--	this	was	a	few	years	ago	--	it	cost	$	100,000	.
today	it	's	$	10,000	.	next	year	it	's	$	1,000	.
the	year	after	it	's	$	100	,	give	or	take	a	year	.
that	's	how	fast	this	is	moving	.
so	here	's	little	nick	--	likes	batman	and	squirt	guns	.
and	it	turns	out	nick	shows	up	at	the	children	's	hospital	with	this	distended	belly	like	a	famine	victim	.
and	it	's	not	that	he	's	not	eating	,	it	's	that	when	he	eats	,	his	intestine	basically	opens	up	and	feces	spill	out	into	his	gut	.
so	a	hundred	surgeries	later	,	he	looks	at	his	mom	and	says	,	``	mom	,	please	pray	for	me	.	i	'm	in	so	much	pain	.	``
his	pediatrician	happens	to	have	a	background	in	clinical	genetics	and	he	has	no	idea	what	's	going	on	,	but	he	says	,	``	let	's	get	this	kid	's	genome	sequenced	.	``
and	what	they	find	is	a	single	-	point	mutation	in	a	gene	responsible	for	controlling	programmed	cell	death	.
so	the	theory	is	that	he	's	having	some	immunological	reaction	to	what	's	going	on	to	the	food	essentially	,	and	that	's	a	natural	reaction	,	which	causes	some	programmed	cell	death	.
but	the	gene	that	regulates	that	down	is	broken	.
and	so	this	informs	,	among	other	things	,	of	course	,	a	treatment	for	bone	marrow	transplant	,	which	he	undertakes	.
and	after	nine	months	of	grueling	recovery	,	he	's	now	eating	steak	with	a	1	sauce	.
the	prospect	of	using	the	genome	as	a	universal	diagnostic	is	upon	us	today	.
today	,	it	's	here	.
and	what	it	means	for	all	of	us	is	that	everybody	in	this	room	could	live	an	extra	five	,	10	,	20	years	just	because	of	this	one	thing	.
which	is	a	fantastic	story	,	unless	you	think	about	humanity	's	footprint	on	the	planet	and	our	ability	to	keep	up	food	production	.
so	it	turns	out	that	the	very	same	technology	is	also	being	used	to	grow	new	lines	of	corn	,	wheat	,	soybean	and	other	crops	that	are	highly	tolerant	of	drought	,	of	flood	,	of	pests	and	pesticides	.
now	look	,	as	long	as	we	continue	to	increase	the	population	,	we	're	going	to	have	to	continue	to	grow	and	eat	genetically	modified	foods	,	and	that	's	the	only	position	that	i	'll	take	today	.
unless	there	's	anybody	in	the	audience	that	would	like	to	volunteer	to	stop	eating	?
none	,	not	one	.
this	is	a	typewriter	,	a	staple	of	every	desktop	for	decades	.
and	in	fact	,	the	typewriter	was	essentially	deleted	by	this	thing	.
and	then	more	general	versions	of	word	processors	came	about	.
but	ultimately	,	it	was	a	disruption	on	top	of	a	disruption	.
it	was	bob	metcalfe	inventing	the	ethernet	and	the	connection	of	all	these	computers	that	fundamentally	changed	everything	.
and	suddenly	we	had	netscape	,	and	we	had	yahoo	and	we	had	,	indeed	,	the	entire	dotcom	bubble	.
not	to	worry	though	,	that	was	quickly	rescued	by	the	ipod	,	facebook	and	,	indeed	,	angry	birds	.
look	,	this	is	where	we	are	today	.
this	is	the	genomic	revolution	today	.	this	is	where	we	are	.
so	what	i	'd	like	you	to	consider	is	:	what	does	it	mean	when	these	dots	do	n't	represent	the	individual	bases	of	your	genome	,	but	they	connect	to	genomes	all	across	the	planet	?
so	i	just	recently	had	to	buy	life	insurance	.
and	i	was	required	to	answer	:	a.	i	have	never	had	a	genetic	test	,	b.	i	've	had	one	,	here	you	go	,	and	c.	i	've	had	one	and	i	'm	not	telling	.
thankfully	,	i	was	able	to	answer	a	,	and	i	say	that	honestly	in	case	my	life	insurance	agent	is	listening	.
but	what	would	have	happened	if	i	had	said	c	?
consumer	applications	for	genomics	,	they	will	flourish	.
do	you	want	to	see	whether	you	're	genetically	compatible	with	your	girlfriend	?	sure	.
dna	sequencing	on	your	iphone	?	there	's	an	app	for	that	.
personalized	genomic	massage	anyone	?
there	's	already	a	lab	today	that	tests	for	allele	334	of	the	avpr	1	gene	,	the	so	-	called	cheating	gene	.
so	anybody	who	's	here	today	with	your	significant	other	,	just	turn	over	to	them	and	swab	their	mouth	,	send	it	to	the	lab	and	you	'll	know	for	sure	.
do	you	really	want	to	elect	a	president	whose	genome	suggests	cardiomyopathy	?
now	think	of	it	,	it	's	2016	and	the	leading	candidate	releases	not	only	her	four	years	of	back	tax	returns	,	but	also	her	personal	genome	.
and	it	looks	really	good	.
and	then	she	challenges	all	of	her	competitors	to	do	the	same	.
do	you	think	that	's	not	going	to	happen	?
do	you	think	it	would	have	helped	john	mccain	?
how	many	people	in	the	audience	have	the	last	name	resnick	like	me	?	raise	your	hand	.
anybody	?	nobody	.
typically	,	there	's	one	or	two	.
so	my	father	's	father	was	one	of	10	resnick	brothers	.
they	all	hated	each	other	.
and	they	all	moved	to	different	parts	of	the	planet	.
so	it	's	likely	that	i	'm	related	to	every	resnick	that	i	ever	meet	,	but	i	do	n't	know	.
but	imagine	if	my	genome	were	deidentified	,	sitting	in	software	,	and	a	third	cousin	's	genome	was	also	sitting	there	,	and	there	was	software	that	could	compare	these	two	and	make	these	associations	.
not	hard	to	imagine	.	my	company	has	software	that	does	this	right	now	.
and	so	imagine	one	more	thing	:	that	that	software	is	able	to	ask	both	parties	for	mutual	consents	,	``	would	you	be	willing	to	meet	your	third	cousin	?	``
and	if	we	both	say	yes	,	voila	!	welcome	to	chromosomally	linkedin	.
now	this	is	probably	a	good	thing	,	right	?
you	have	bigger	clan	gatherings	and	so	on	.
but	maybe	it	's	a	bad	thing	as	well	.
how	many	fathers	in	the	room	?	raise	your	hands	.
okay	,	so	experts	think	that	one	to	three	percent	of	you	are	not	actually	the	father	of	your	child	.
look	--	these	genomes	,	these	23	chromosomes	,	they	do	n't	in	any	way	represent	the	quality	of	our	relationships	or	the	nature	of	our	society	--	at	least	not	yet	.
and	like	any	new	technology	,	it	's	really	in	humanity	's	hands	to	wield	it	for	the	betterment	of	mankind	,	or	not	.
and	so	i	urge	you	all	to	wake	up	and	to	tune	in	and	to	influence	the	genomic	revolution	that	's	happening	all	around	you	.
thank	you	.
