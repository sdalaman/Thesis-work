dan	holzman	:	please	throw	out	the	beanbag	chairs	.	here	we	go	.
barry	friedman	:	there	are	all	kinds	of	high	-	tech	chairs	here	today	,	but	this	is	really	,	i	think	,	when	it	reached	its	peak	as	far	as	ergonomics	,	comfort	,	design	,	flexibility	...
dh	:	now	obviously	,	this	is	not	something	we	do	on	our	regular	show	;	it	's	something	we	just	kind	of	learned	for	this	,	so	we	're	going	to	try	.	but	can	we	have	some	inspirational	music	for	the	beanbag	chairs	?
bf	:	nice	show	,	daniel	,	nice	show	.	you	are	the	man	!
nice	show	.	man	,	that	was	good	!
dh	:	thank	you	.
bf	:	you	know	,	sometimes	when	people	do	those	,	they	go	all	the	way	down	.
you	actually	just	did	that	.
that	's	the	kind	of	extra	effort	that	's	gotten	us	where	we	are	today	...
dh	:	all	right	,	let	's	show	them	something	special	.
bf	:	...	without	a	macarthur	grant	.
yeah	,	look	at	this	.	you	know	,	all	kinds	of	different	...
ted	is	about	invention	,	let	's	be	honest	.	right	?	dh	:	yeah	,	it	is	.
bf	:	last	night	,	michael	moschen	showed	some	juggling	props	he	has	invented	and	working	on	.
right	now	,	dan	's	going	to	show	something	he	actually	invented	.
dh	:	a	type	of	juggling	i	actually	invented	,	right	after	i	saw	another	juggler	do	it	.
bf	:	shut	up	.
dh	:	and	this	is	a	small	excerpt	from	a	longer	piece	.
folks	,	this	is	shaker	cup	juggling	.	it	's	not	a	showstopper	but	it	certainly	slows	it	down	.
bf	:	oh	yeah	,	it	does	.
bf	:	oh	,	daniel	.
dh	:	one	more	?
perfect	.
perfect	.
bf	:	ok	.	dh	:	oh	!	all	right	.
i	'm	now	pushing	my	luck	:	i	'm	skipping	right	to	six	cups	.
in	order	to	do	six	cups	,	i	must	have	perfect	control	over	three	with	my	right	hand	.
bf	:	also	three	with	his	left	.
dh	:	perfect	.
and	now	,	all	six	cups	.	should	i	do	it	on	the	first	try	or	should	i	miss	once	on	purpose	?
bf	:	first	try	?	once	on	purpose	?
dh	:	how	about	if	i	try	first	and	then	decide	?
bf	:	good	idea	.	let	's	leave	that	.	we	'll	leave	that	door	open	.
dh	:	he	's	looking	at	me	.
bf	:	that	's	all	right	,	he	does	that	.	all	right	.
dh	:	oh	!	it	's	time	for	richard	's	help	.
oh	,	good	.	all	right	.
bf	:	you	know	,	over	the	years	,	every	year	at	the	conference	,	it	's	kind	of	become	a	tradition	for	us	to	do	something	dangerous	with	richard	.	and	we	've	always	done	something	with	the	bullwhips	in	our	act	.	it	's	funny	,	for	years	i	did	it	with	daniel	holding	balloons	.
and	then	we	thought	,	``	how	stupid	.	``
dh	:	excuse	me	,	could	we	work	on	the	design	of	the	microphone	?
bf	:	i	think	that	's	the	next	session	.
dh	:	next	session	?
bf	:	yeah	.	and	so	we	've	actually	found	a	way	to	incorporate	richard	in	this	.
he	actually	assumes	more	of	the	danger	in	this	.
dh	:	please	stand	up	,	richard	.
dh	:	now	richard	,	please	...
bf	:	ok	,	sorry	.
dh	:	jesus	christ	.	richard	,	please	stand	in	front	of	me	.
richard	wurman	:	can	i	say	something	?
bf	:	sure	.
rw	:	in	all	past	years	i	've	rehearsed	with	them	,	the	things	that	have	happened	to	me	--	i	have	no	idea	what	's	going	to	happen	and	that	's	the	truth	.
dh	:	all	right	,	please	stand	here	in	front	...
god	,	i	hate	that	.	put	your	hands	out	like	this	,	please	.
bf	:	no	,	come	stay	up	with	him	.
dan	used	to	actually	hold	them	but	now	he	's	got	you	for	protection	.
it	's	kind	of	neat	.	ok	.
dh	:	wow	,	you	've	been	working	out	.
bf	:	no	,	shut	up	!
having	a	little	bit	of	richard	time	.	that	's	nice	,	that	's	good	.
ok	,	here	we	go	.
have	him	hold	your	wrist	so	i	can	...
dh	:	please	hold	my	wrist	,	will	you	.	bf	:	yeah	,	hold	this	a	minute	.
there	you	go	.
ok	.
ok	,	hold	on	.
rw	:	hmmm	.
dh	:	first	one	.
bf	:	all	those	mid	-	year	phone	calls	are	coming	back	to	me	now	,	richard	.
dh	:	so	richard	,	what	were	we	on	the	list	?	like	1,020	?
what	happened	there	?
bf	:	i	think	we	were	just	outside	.
dh	:	sorry	.	bf	:	having	some	bad	flashbacks	.
rw	:	do	you	want	me	to	hold	you	or	not	?	dh	:	do	n't	hold	me	that	hard	.
bf	:	here	we	go	,	i	'm	taking	it	.
dh	:	one	more	,	one	more	.
bf	:	we	've	got	one	more	we	're	going	to	do	.
rw	:	do	i	get	to	hold	them	?
bf	:	you	do	n't	want	to	hold	these	,	trust	me	.
dh	:	could	you	spread	your	legs	a	little	bit	?
bf	:	gloria	,	you	want	to	do	it	?	it	's	very	cool	.
one	more	try	.	man	,	i	do	n't	want	to	get	too	close	.
could	you	just	push	that	?
dh	:	wow	!	boy	!
bf	:	that	's	cool	.	i	always	wanted	to	try	that	.
dh	:	let	's	jump	this	way	,	though	.
now	,	we	risked	richard	's	life	,	it	's	only	fair	we	risk	our	own	lives	.
so	to	do	that	,	i	will	juggle	these	three	razor	-	sharp	sickles	.
and	if	that	was	n't	enough	,	and	judging	by	your	response	,	it	's	not	...
dh	:	wow	!	bf	:	hoping	for	a	little	more	build	.
dh	:	true	.	barry	...
bf	:	i	'm	going	to	run	up	behind	him	.
dh	:	leap	over	my	shoulder	.
bf	:	up	and	over	his	shoulders	.
dh	:	grab	the	blades	in	mid	-	air	,	land	right	there	in	a	pool	of	blood	...
still	juggling	.
impossible	,	you	say	?
bf	:	incredible	,	you	say	?
dh	:	why	bother	,	you	say	?
bf	:	here	we	go	.
dh	:	just	do	it	juggler	boys	,	you	say	?
bf	:	this	guy	,	this	guy	invented	air	.
dh	:	i	think	so	,	that	's	right	.
even	the	pencil	.
bf	:	he	invented	the	pencil	.
dh	:	all	right	,	we	'll	do	this	trick	,	but	please	remember	it	took	us	over	10	years	to	perfect	.
bf	:	ten	years	to	perfect	,	which	you	're	about	to	see	.
dh	:	it	's	not	that	difficult	,	we	just	do	n't	like	to	practice	that	much	.
bf	:	no	,	it	's	a	hassle	.	traveling	too	much	.
actually	,	we	will	take	a	second	to	prove	--	this	could	be	fake	--	that	the	blades	are	indeed	razor	-	sharp	.
dh	:	will	someone	please	throw	a	small	farm	animal	up	onto	the	stage	?
or	a	virgin	for	a	sacrifice	?
bf	:	anything	?
dh	:	where	's	gloria	?
bf	:	no	,	she	's	got	...	farm	animal	.
dh	:	do	you	have	a	small	farm	animal	?
just	trying	to	play	the	odds	.	all	right	,	here	we	go	.
bf	:	over	the	top	,	over	the	top	.
dh	:	how	you	feeling	,	barry	?	you	feeling	all	right	?
bf	:	yeah	,	it	's	all	right	.
dh	:	do	you	feel	everything	's	ok	?	the	atmosphere	,	the	...
bf	:	yeah	,	a	little	sketchy	.
dh	:	everything	up	here	's	ok	?
bf	:	yeah	.
dh	:	then	here	we	go	.
bf	:	this	one	's	a	little	...	who	's	doing	the	lights	?	could	you	point	that	a	little	more	directly	into	my	eyeballs	?	is	that	possible	?	i	can	still	see	a	little	.
dh	:	and	turn	up	the	intensity	;	we	're	still	pink	in	the	middle	.
we	went	too	far	.
bf	:	yeah	,	it	's	too	far	.	it	's	too	much	of	a	visual	.
the	design	of	the	body	is	a	whole	different	thing	.
dh	:	ready	,	barry	?	bf	:	over	the	top	.
dh	:	may	we	have	our	jumping	music	please	?
may	we	have	it	a	bit	louder	?
bf	:	they	're	a	good	crew	!	whoa	!
dh	:	whoa	,	sorry	.	all	right	.
bf	:	we	're	going	on	.
dh	:	all	right	,	we	'll	try	again	.
bf	:	all	right	?	oh	my	gosh	.	oh	.
dh	:	all	right	,	here	we	go	.	sorry	about	that	.
bf	:	i	thought	i	had	the	hard	part	.	ok	.
dh	:	whenever	you	're	ready	.
bf	:	there	we	go	!
all	right	,	get	up	!	come	on	and	dance	!	dh	:	dance	,	come	on	.	bf	:	come	on	and	dance	!
somebody	dance	!	come	on	!
wow	,	wow	,	ok	,	stop	.
weird	,	no	one	dances	.	we	're	two	guys	doing	this	.
i	think	that	's	uncomfortable	for	everyone	.
dh	:	the	french	judge	...
bf	:	one	more	quick	thing	.
dh	:	the	french	judge	gives	it	a	5.2	.
bf	:	well	,	you	know	...
dh	:	there	you	go	...	bf	:	oh	,	yeah	.	another	one	coming	in	.
dh	:	tell	them	about	our	bio	and	stuff	.
bf	:	yeah	.	in	our	bio	,	some	of	you	may	have	read	that	we	've	won	two	world	juggling	championships	.
and	believe	it	or	not	,	you	do	n't	win	juggling	champions	for	doing	things	with	bullwhips	or	shaker	cups	.
we	're	going	to	show	you	right	now	an	excerpt	from	a	routine	that	we	used	to	wipe	out	the	other	juggling	team	competition	.
dh	:	that	's	right	.
bf	:	good	.
dh	:	i	know	what	you	're	thinking	:	other	juggling	teams	must	really	suck	.
bf	:	juggling	's	got	a	bad	rap	.
dh	:	but	wait	,	barry	,	there	's	still	one	more	club	lying	there	by	my	foot	.
and	look	,	it	has	a	twin	!
dh	:	there	's	still	one	more	by	my	foot	.
what	do	you	want	me	to	do	with	it	?
bf	:	richard	you	tell	him	,	it	's	your	last	year	.
dh	:	that	's	a	pretty	good	setup	,	richard	.
bf	:	yeah	,	it	's	a	good	setup	.	that	's	a	big	setup	.
dh	:	you	ca	n't	get	any	better	than	that	.	all	right	.	what	i	will	do	:	i	will	use	my	panther	-	like	reflexes	.
bf	:	nice	.
dh	:	i	got	that	--	to	reach	down	and	grab	that	club	in	my	grip	of	steel	.
bf	:	nice	.
dh	:	i	touched	it	,	barry	.	that	should	be	enough	.
bf	:	it	's	progress	,	that	's	the	thing	.
dh	:	how	about	that	?	i	'll	do	it	again	.
oh	wait	,	it	's	on	your	side	,	barry	.
and	it	's	awfully	windy	over	there	.
bf	:	it	is	,	it	's	weird	.	you	would	n't	think	it	would	affect	half	the	stage	,	but	it	is	.	it	's	weird	.
watch	this	:	what	i	'm	going	to	do	is	slide	the	seventh	one	onto	my	foot	.
dh	:	wow	!	what	a	great	trick	,	barry	!
oh	,	look	how	it	lies	there	.
oh	,	barry	,	is	there	nothing	you	ca	n't	do	?
you	are	my	hero	.	you	're	my	jim	shea	,	jr	.
too	much	olympics	.
bf	:	from	my	foot	,	i	'll	attempt	to	kick	the	seventh	club	.	here	we	go	.
dh	:	where	,	barry	?	where	?	tell	us	,	barry	.
[	unclear	]	eagerly	awaits	your	next	syllable	.	what	will	it	be	?
what	gem	of	knowledge	?
what	pearl	of	wisdom	?
do	you	want	to	buy	a	vowel	,	barry	?
is	that	your	final	answer	?
bf	:	all	right	!	you	have	to	turn	off	the	tv	from	time	to	time	.
dh	:	i	do	,	i	do	.
bf	:	from	my	foot	,	the	kick	up	in	the	seven	.
dh	:	we	will	juggle	seven	.
bf	:	from	six	to	seven	.	dh	:	that	's	a	world	's	record	.	bf	:	really	?	dh	:	for	us	.
bf	:	yes	.
dh	:	whenever	you	're	ready	there	,	big	guy	.
put	your	tongue	away	,	barry	.
bf	:	oh	,	oh	,	whoa	.
dh	:	please	,	please	stay	seated	.	stay	seated	.	thank	you	.
because	now	,	to	make	this	twice	as	difficult	,	we	'll	juggle	the	seven	clubs	back	...
bf	:	seven	-	club	juggling	.
dh	:	...	to	back	.
bf	:	thank	you	,	that	's	it	.
bf	:	thank	you	guys	!
dh	:	thank	you	very	much	!
