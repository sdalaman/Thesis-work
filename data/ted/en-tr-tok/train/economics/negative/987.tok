so	yeah	,	i	'm	a	newspaper	cartoonist	--	political	cartoonist	.
i	do	n't	know	if	you	've	heard	about	it	--	newspapers	?
it	's	a	sort	of	paper	-	based	reader	.
it	's	lighter	than	an	ipad	,	it	's	a	bit	cheaper	.
you	know	what	they	say	?
they	say	the	print	media	is	dying	--	who	says	that	?	well	,	the	media	.
but	this	is	no	news	,	right	?
you	've	read	about	it	already	.
ladies	and	gentlemen	,	the	world	has	gotten	smaller	.
i	know	it	's	a	cliche	,	but	look	,	look	how	small	,	how	tiny	it	has	gotten	.
and	you	know	the	reason	why	,	of	course	.
this	is	because	of	technology	--	yeah	.
any	computer	designers	in	the	room	?
yeah	well	,	you	guys	are	making	my	life	miserable	because	track	pads	used	to	be	round	,	a	nice	round	shape	.
that	makes	a	good	cartoon	.
but	what	are	you	going	to	do	with	a	flat	track	pad	,	those	square	things	?
there	's	nothing	i	can	do	as	a	cartoonist	.
well	,	i	know	the	world	is	flat	now	.
that	's	true	.
and	the	internet	has	reached	every	corner	of	the	world	,	the	poorest	,	the	remotest	places	.
every	village	in	africa	now	has	a	cyber	cafe	.
do	n't	go	asking	for	a	frappuccino	there	.
so	we	are	bridging	the	digital	divide	.
the	third	world	is	connected	,	we	are	connected	.
and	what	happens	next	?
well	,	you	've	got	mail	.
yeah	.
well	,	the	internet	has	empowered	us	.
it	has	empowered	you	,	it	has	empowered	me	and	it	has	empowered	some	other	guys	as	well	.
you	know	,	these	last	two	cartoons	--	i	did	them	live	during	a	conference	in	hanoi	.
and	they	were	not	used	to	that	in	communist	2.0	vietnam	.
so	i	was	cartooning	live	on	a	wide	screen	--	it	was	quite	a	sensation	--	and	then	this	guy	came	to	me	.
he	was	taking	pictures	of	me	and	of	my	sketches	,	and	i	thought	,	``	this	is	great	,	a	vietnamese	fan	.	``
and	as	he	came	the	second	day	,	i	thought	,	``	wow	,	that	's	really	a	cartoon	lover	.	``
and	on	the	third	day	,	i	finally	understood	,	the	guy	was	actually	on	duty	.
so	by	now	,	there	must	be	a	hundred	pictures	of	me	smiling	with	my	sketches	in	the	files	of	the	vietnamese	police	.
no	,	but	it	's	true	:	the	internet	has	changed	the	world	.
it	has	rocked	the	music	industry	;	it	has	changed	the	way	we	consume	music	.
for	those	of	you	old	enough	to	remember	,	we	used	to	have	to	go	to	the	store	to	steal	it	.
and	it	has	changed	the	way	your	future	employer	will	look	at	your	application	.
so	be	careful	with	that	facebook	account	--	your	momma	told	you	,	be	careful	.
and	technology	has	set	us	free	--	this	is	free	wifi	.
but	yeah	,	it	has	liberated	us	from	the	office	desk	.
this	is	your	life	,	enjoy	it	.
in	short	,	technology	,	the	internet	,	they	have	changed	our	lifestyle	.
tech	guru	,	like	this	man	--	that	a	german	magazine	called	the	philosopher	of	the	21st	century	--	they	are	shaping	the	way	we	do	things	.
they	are	shaping	the	way	we	consume	.
they	are	shaping	our	very	desires	.
you	will	not	like	it	.
and	technology	has	even	changed	our	relationship	to	god	.
now	i	should	n't	get	into	this	.
religion	and	political	cartoons	,	as	you	may	have	heard	,	make	a	difficult	couple	,	ever	since	that	day	of	2005	,	when	a	bunch	of	cartoonists	in	denmark	drew	cartoons	that	had	repercussions	all	over	the	world	--	demonstrations	,	fatwa	,	they	provoked	violence	.	people	died	in	the	violence	.
this	was	so	sickening	;	people	died	because	of	cartoons	.
i	mean	--	i	had	the	feeling	at	the	time	that	cartoons	had	been	used	by	both	sides	,	actually	.
they	were	used	first	by	a	danish	newspaper	,	which	wanted	to	make	a	point	on	islam	.
a	danish	cartoonist	told	me	he	was	one	of	the	24	who	received	the	assignment	to	draw	the	prophet	--	12	of	them	refused	.	did	you	know	that	?
he	told	me	,	``	nobody	has	to	tell	me	what	i	should	draw	.
this	is	not	how	it	works	.	``
and	then	,	of	course	,	they	were	used	by	extremists	and	politicians	on	the	other	side	.
they	wanted	to	stir	up	controversy	.
you	know	the	story	.
we	know	that	cartoons	can	be	used	as	weapons	.
history	tells	us	,	they	've	been	used	by	the	nazis	to	attack	the	jews	.
and	here	we	are	now	.
in	the	united	nations	,	half	of	the	world	is	pushing	to	penalize	the	offense	to	religion	--	they	call	it	the	defamation	of	religion	--	while	the	other	half	of	the	world	is	fighting	back	in	defense	of	freedom	of	speech	.
so	the	clash	of	civilizations	is	here	,	and	cartoons	are	at	the	middle	of	it	?
this	got	me	thinking	.
now	you	see	me	thinking	at	my	kitchen	table	,	and	since	you	're	in	my	kitchen	,	please	meet	my	wife	.
in	2006	,	a	few	months	after	,	i	went	ivory	coast	--	western	africa	.
now	,	talk	of	a	divided	place	--	the	country	was	cut	in	two	.
you	had	a	rebellion	in	the	north	,	the	government	in	the	south	--	the	capital	,	abidjan	--	and	in	the	middle	,	the	french	army	.
this	looks	like	a	giant	hamburger	.
you	do	n't	want	to	be	the	ham	in	the	middle	.
i	was	there	to	report	on	that	story	in	cartoons	.
i	've	been	doing	this	for	the	last	15	years	;	it	's	my	side	job	,	if	you	want	.
so	you	see	the	style	is	different	.
this	is	more	serious	than	maybe	editorial	cartooning	.
i	went	to	places	like	gaza	during	the	war	in	2009	.
so	this	is	really	journalism	in	cartoons	.
you	'll	hear	more	and	more	about	it	.
this	is	the	future	of	journalism	,	i	think	.
and	of	course	,	i	went	to	see	the	rebels	in	the	north	.
those	were	poor	guys	fighting	for	their	rights	.
there	was	an	ethnic	side	to	this	conflict	as	very	often	in	africa	.
and	i	went	to	see	the	dozo	.
the	dozo	,	they	are	the	traditional	hunters	of	west	africa	.
people	fear	them	--	they	help	the	rebellion	a	lot	.
they	are	believed	to	have	magical	powers	.
they	can	disappear	and	escape	bullets	.
i	went	to	see	a	dozo	chief	;	he	told	me	about	his	magical	powers	.
he	said	,	``	i	can	chop	your	head	off	right	away	and	bring	you	back	to	life	.	``
i	said	,	``	well	,	maybe	we	do	n't	have	time	for	this	right	now	.	``
``	another	time	.	``
so	back	in	abidjan	,	i	was	given	a	chance	to	lead	a	workshop	with	local	cartoonists	there	and	i	thought	,	yes	,	in	a	context	like	this	,	cartoons	can	really	be	used	as	weapons	against	the	other	side	.
i	mean	,	the	press	in	ivory	coast	was	bitterly	divided	--	it	was	compared	to	the	media	in	rwanda	before	the	genocide	--	so	imagine	.
and	what	can	a	cartoonist	do	?
sometimes	editors	would	tell	their	cartoonists	to	draw	what	they	wanted	to	see	,	and	the	guy	has	to	feed	his	family	,	right	?
so	the	idea	was	pretty	simple	.
we	brought	together	cartoonists	from	all	sides	in	ivory	coast	.
we	took	them	away	from	their	newspaper	for	three	days	.
and	i	asked	them	to	do	a	project	together	,	tackle	the	issues	affecting	their	country	in	cartoons	,	yes	,	in	cartoons	.
show	the	positive	power	of	cartoons	.
it	's	a	great	tool	of	communication	for	bad	or	for	good	.
and	cartoons	can	cross	boundaries	,	as	you	have	seen	.
and	humor	is	a	good	way	,	i	think	,	to	address	serious	issues	.
and	i	'm	very	proud	of	what	they	did	.
i	mean	,	they	did	n't	agree	with	each	other	--	that	was	not	the	point	.
and	i	did	n't	ask	them	to	do	nice	cartoons	.
the	first	day	,	they	were	even	shouting	at	each	other	.
but	they	came	up	with	a	book	,	looking	back	at	13	years	of	political	crisis	in	ivory	coast	.
so	the	idea	was	there	.
and	i	've	been	doing	projects	like	this	,	in	2009	in	lebanon	,	this	year	in	kenya	,	back	in	january	.
in	lebanon	,	it	was	not	a	book	.
the	idea	was	to	have	--	the	same	principal	,	a	divided	country	--	take	cartoonists	from	all	sides	and	let	them	do	something	together	.
so	in	lebanon	,	we	enrolled	the	newspaper	editors	,	and	we	got	them	to	publish	eight	cartoonists	from	all	sides	all	together	on	the	same	page	,	addressing	the	issue	affecting	lebanon	,	like	religion	in	politics	and	everyday	life	.
and	it	worked	.
for	three	days	,	almost	all	the	newspapers	of	beirut	published	all	those	cartoonists	together	--	anti	-	government	,	pro	-	government	,	christian	,	muslim	,	of	course	,	english	-	speaking	,	well	,	you	name	it	.
so	this	was	a	great	project	.
and	then	in	kenya	,	what	we	did	was	addressing	the	issue	of	ethnicity	,	which	is	a	poison	in	a	lot	of	places	in	africa	.
and	we	did	video	clips	--	you	can	see	them	if	you	go	to	youtube	/	kenyatoons	.
so	,	preaching	for	freedom	of	speech	is	easy	here	,	but	as	you	have	seen	in	contexts	of	repression	or	division	,	again	,	what	can	a	cartoonist	do	?
he	has	to	keep	his	job	.
well	i	believe	that	in	any	context	anywhere	,	he	always	has	the	choice	at	least	not	to	do	a	cartoon	that	will	feed	hatred	.
and	that	's	the	message	i	try	to	convey	to	them	.
i	think	we	all	always	have	the	choice	in	the	end	not	to	do	the	bad	thing	.
but	we	need	to	support	these	[	unclear	]	,	critical	and	responsible	voices	in	africa	,	in	lebanon	,	in	your	local	newspaper	,	in	the	apple	store	.
today	,	tech	companies	are	the	world	's	largest	editors	.
they	decide	what	is	too	offensive	or	too	provocative	for	you	to	see	.
so	really	,	it	's	not	about	the	freedom	of	cartoonists	;	it	's	about	your	freedoms	.
and	for	dictators	all	over	the	world	,	the	good	news	is	when	cartoonists	,	journalists	and	activists	shut	up	.
thank	you	.
