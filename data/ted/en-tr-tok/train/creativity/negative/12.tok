thank	you	.	it	's	really	an	honor	and	a	privilege	to	be	here	spending	my	last	day	as	a	teenager	.
today	i	want	to	talk	to	you	about	the	future	,	but	first	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	a	bit	about	the	past	.
my	story	starts	way	before	i	was	born	.
my	grandmother	was	on	a	train	to	auschwitz	,	the	death	camp	.
and	she	was	going	along	the	tracks	,	and	the	tracks	split	.
and	somehow	--	we	do	n't	really	know	exactly	the	whole	story	--	but	the	train	took	the	wrong	track	and	went	to	a	work	camp	rather	than	the	death	camp	.
my	grandmother	survived	and	married	my	grandfather	.
they	were	living	in	hungary	,	and	my	mother	was	born	.
and	when	my	mother	was	two	years	old	,	the	hungarian	revolution	was	raging	,	and	they	decided	to	escape	hungary	.
they	got	on	a	boat	,	and	yet	another	divergence	--	the	boat	was	either	going	to	canada	or	to	australia	.
they	got	on	and	did	n't	know	where	they	were	going	,	and	ended	up	in	canada	.
so	,	to	make	a	long	story	short	,	they	came	to	canada	.
my	grandmother	was	a	chemist	.	she	worked	at	the	banting	institute	in	toronto	,	and	at	44	she	died	of	stomach	cancer	.	i	never	met	my	grandmother	,	but	i	carry	on	her	name	--	her	exact	name	,	eva	vertes	--	and	i	like	to	think	i	carry	on	her	scientific	passion	,	too	.
i	found	this	passion	not	far	from	here	,	actually	,	when	i	was	nine	years	old	.
my	family	was	on	a	road	trip	and	we	were	in	the	grand	canyon	.
and	i	had	never	been	a	reader	when	i	was	young	--	my	dad	had	tried	me	with	the	hardy	boys	;	i	tried	nancy	drew	;	i	tried	all	that	--	and	i	just	did	n't	like	reading	books	.
and	my	mother	bought	this	book	when	we	were	at	the	grand	canyon	called	``	the	hot	zone	.	``	it	was	all	about	the	outbreak	of	the	ebola	virus	.
and	something	about	it	just	kind	of	drew	me	towards	it	.
there	was	this	big	sort	of	bumpy	-	looking	virus	on	the	cover	,	and	i	just	wanted	to	read	it	.	i	picked	up	that	book	,	and	as	we	drove	from	the	edge	of	the	grand	canyon	to	big	sur	,	and	to	,	actually	,	here	where	we	are	today	,	in	monterey	,	i	read	that	book	,	and	from	when	i	was	reading	that	book	,	i	knew	that	i	wanted	to	have	a	life	in	medicine	.
i	wanted	to	be	like	the	explorers	i	'd	read	about	in	the	book	,	who	went	into	the	jungles	of	africa	,	went	into	the	research	labs	and	just	tried	to	figure	out	what	this	deadly	virus	was	.	so	from	that	moment	on	,	i	read	every	medical	book	i	could	get	my	hands	on	,	and	i	just	loved	it	so	much	.
i	was	a	passive	observer	of	the	medical	world	.
it	was	n't	until	i	entered	high	school	that	i	thought	,	``	maybe	now	,	you	know	--	being	a	big	high	school	kid	--	i	can	maybe	become	an	active	part	of	this	big	medical	world	.	``
i	was	14	,	and	i	emailed	professors	at	the	local	university	to	see	if	maybe	i	could	go	work	in	their	lab	.	and	hardly	anyone	responded	.
but	i	mean	,	why	would	they	respond	to	a	14	-	year	-	old	,	anyway	?
and	i	got	to	go	talk	to	one	professor	,	dr.	jacobs	,	who	accepted	me	into	the	lab	.
at	that	time	,	i	was	really	interested	in	neuroscience	and	wanted	to	do	a	research	project	in	neurology	--	specifically	looking	at	the	effects	of	heavy	metals	on	the	developing	nervous	system	.
so	i	started	that	,	and	worked	in	his	lab	for	a	year	,	and	found	the	results	that	i	guess	you	'd	expect	to	find	when	you	feed	fruit	flies	heavy	metals	--	that	it	really	,	really	impaired	the	nervous	system	.
the	spinal	cord	had	breaks	.	the	neurons	were	crossing	in	every	which	way	.
and	from	then	i	wanted	to	look	not	at	impairment	,	but	at	prevention	of	impairment	.
so	that	's	what	led	me	to	alzheimer	's	.	i	started	reading	about	alzheimer	's	and	tried	to	familiarize	myself	with	the	research	,	and	at	the	same	time	when	i	was	in	the	--	i	was	reading	in	the	medical	library	one	day	,	and	i	read	this	article	about	something	called	``	purine	derivatives	.	``
and	they	seemed	to	have	cell	growth	-	promoting	properties	.
and	being	naive	about	the	whole	field	,	i	kind	of	thought	,	``	oh	,	you	have	cell	death	in	alzheimer	's	which	is	causing	the	memory	deficit	,	and	then	you	have	this	compound	--	purine	derivatives	--	that	are	promoting	cell	growth	.	``
and	so	i	thought	,	``	maybe	if	it	can	promote	cell	growth	,	it	can	inhibit	cell	death	,	too	.	``
and	so	that	's	the	project	that	i	pursued	for	that	year	,	and	it	's	continuing	now	as	well	,	and	found	that	a	specific	purine	derivative	called	``	guanidine	``	had	inhibited	the	cell	growth	by	approximately	60	percent	.
so	i	presented	those	results	at	the	international	science	fair	,	which	was	just	one	of	the	most	amazing	experiences	of	my	life	.
and	there	i	was	awarded	``	best	in	the	world	in	medicine	,	``	which	allowed	me	to	get	in	,	or	at	least	get	a	foot	in	the	door	of	the	big	medical	world	.
and	from	then	on	,	since	i	was	now	in	this	huge	exciting	world	,	i	wanted	to	explore	it	all	.	i	wanted	it	all	at	once	,	but	knew	i	could	n't	really	get	that	.
and	i	stumbled	across	something	called	``	cancer	stem	cells	.	``
and	this	is	really	what	i	want	to	talk	to	you	about	today	--	about	cancer	.
at	first	when	i	heard	of	cancer	stem	cells	,	i	did	n't	really	know	how	to	put	the	two	together	.	i	'd	heard	of	stem	cells	,	and	i	'd	heard	of	them	as	the	panacea	of	the	future	--	the	therapy	of	many	diseases	to	come	in	the	future	,	perhaps	.
but	i	'd	heard	of	cancer	as	the	most	feared	disease	of	our	time	,	so	how	did	the	good	and	bad	go	together	?
last	summer	i	worked	at	stanford	university	,	doing	some	research	on	cancer	stem	cells	.
and	while	i	was	doing	this	,	i	was	reading	the	cancer	literature	,	trying	to	--	again	--	familiarize	myself	with	this	new	medical	field	.
and	it	seemed	that	tumors	actually	begin	from	a	stem	cell	.
this	fascinated	me	.	the	more	i	read	,	the	more	i	looked	at	cancer	differently	and	almost	became	less	fearful	of	it	.
it	seems	that	cancer	is	a	direct	result	to	injury	.
if	you	smoke	,	you	damage	your	lung	tissue	,	and	then	lung	cancer	arises	.
if	you	drink	,	you	damage	your	liver	,	and	then	liver	cancer	occurs	.
and	it	was	really	interesting	--	there	were	articles	correlating	if	you	have	a	bone	fracture	,	and	then	bone	cancer	arises	.
because	what	stem	cells	are	--	they	're	these	phenomenal	cells	that	really	have	the	ability	to	differentiate	into	any	type	of	tissue	.
so	,	if	the	body	is	sensing	that	you	have	damage	to	an	organ	and	then	it	's	initiating	cancer	,	it	's	almost	as	if	this	is	a	repair	response	.
and	the	cancer	,	the	body	is	saying	the	lung	tissue	is	damaged	,	we	need	to	repair	the	lung	.	and	cancer	is	originating	in	the	lung	trying	to	repair	--	because	you	have	this	excessive	proliferation	of	these	remarkable	cells	that	really	have	the	potential	to	become	lung	tissue	.
but	it	's	almost	as	if	the	body	has	originated	this	ingenious	response	,	but	ca	n't	quite	control	it	.
it	has	n't	yet	become	fine	-	tuned	enough	to	finish	what	has	been	initiated	.
so	this	really	,	really	fascinated	me	.
and	i	really	think	that	we	ca	n't	think	about	cancer	--	let	alone	any	disease	--	in	such	black	-	and	-	white	terms	.
if	we	eliminate	cancer	the	way	we	're	trying	to	do	now	,	with	chemotherapy	and	radiation	,	we	're	bombarding	the	body	or	the	cancer	with	toxins	,	or	with	radiation	,	trying	to	kill	it	.
it	's	almost	as	if	we	're	getting	back	to	this	starting	point	.
we	're	removing	the	cancer	cells	,	but	we	're	revealing	the	previous	damage	that	the	body	has	tried	to	fix	.
should	n't	we	think	about	manipulation	,	rather	than	elimination	?
if	somehow	we	can	cause	these	cells	to	differentiate	--	to	become	bone	tissue	,	lung	tissue	,	liver	tissue	,	whatever	that	cancer	has	been	put	there	to	do	--	it	would	be	a	repair	process	.	we	'd	end	up	better	than	we	were	before	cancer	.
so	,	this	really	changed	my	view	of	looking	at	cancer	.
and	while	i	was	reading	all	these	articles	about	cancer	,	it	seemed	that	the	articles	--	a	lot	of	them	--	focused	on	,	you	know	,	the	genetics	of	breast	cancer	,	and	the	genesis	and	the	progression	of	breast	cancer	--	tracking	the	cancer	through	the	body	,	tracing	where	it	is	,	where	it	goes	.
but	it	struck	me	that	i	'd	never	heard	of	cancer	of	the	heart	,	or	cancer	of	any	skeletal	muscle	for	that	matter	.
and	skeletal	muscle	constitutes	50	percent	of	our	body	,	or	over	50	percent	of	our	body	.	and	so	at	first	i	kind	of	thought	,	``	well	,	maybe	there	's	some	obvious	explanation	why	skeletal	muscle	does	n't	get	cancer	--	at	least	not	that	i	know	of	.	``
so	,	i	looked	further	into	it	,	found	as	many	articles	as	i	could	,	and	it	was	amazing	--	because	it	turned	out	that	it	was	very	rare	.
some	articles	even	went	as	far	as	to	say	that	skeletal	muscle	tissue	is	resistant	to	cancer	,	and	furthermore	,	not	only	to	cancer	,	but	of	metastases	going	to	skeletal	muscle	.
and	what	metastases	are	is	when	the	tumor	--	when	a	piece	--	breaks	off	and	travels	through	the	blood	stream	and	goes	to	a	different	organ	.	that	's	what	a	metastasis	is	.
it	's	the	part	of	cancer	that	is	the	most	dangerous	.
if	cancer	was	localized	,	we	could	likely	remove	it	,	or	somehow	--	you	know	,	it	's	contained	.	it	's	very	contained	.
but	once	it	starts	moving	throughout	the	body	,	that	's	when	it	becomes	deadly	.
so	the	fact	that	not	only	did	cancer	not	seem	to	originate	in	skeletal	muscles	,	but	cancer	did	n't	seem	to	go	to	skeletal	muscle	--	there	seemed	to	be	something	here	.
so	these	articles	were	saying	,	you	know	,	``	skeletal	--	metastasis	to	skeletal	muscle	--	is	very	rare	.	``
but	it	was	left	at	that	.	no	one	seemed	to	be	asking	why	.
so	i	decided	to	ask	why	.	at	first	--	the	first	thing	i	did	was	i	emailed	some	professors	who	specialized	in	skeletal	muscle	physiology	,	and	pretty	much	said	,	``	hey	,	it	seems	like	cancer	does	n't	really	go	to	skeletal	muscle	.
is	there	a	reason	for	this	?	``	and	a	lot	of	the	replies	i	got	were	that	muscle	is	terminally	differentiated	tissue	.
meaning	that	you	have	muscle	cells	,	but	they	're	not	dividing	,	so	it	does	n't	seem	like	a	good	target	for	cancer	to	hijack	.
but	then	again	,	this	fact	that	the	metastases	did	n't	go	to	skeletal	muscle	made	that	seem	unlikely	.
and	furthermore	,	that	nervous	tissue	--	brain	--	gets	cancer	,	and	brain	cells	are	also	terminally	differentiated	.
so	i	decided	to	ask	why	.	and	here	's	some	of	,	i	guess	,	my	hypotheses	that	i	'll	be	starting	to	investigate	this	may	at	the	sylvester	cancer	institute	in	miami	.
and	i	guess	i	'll	keep	investigating	until	i	get	the	answers	.
but	i	know	that	in	science	,	once	you	get	the	answers	,	inevitably	you	're	going	to	have	more	questions	.
so	i	guess	you	could	say	that	i	'll	probably	be	doing	this	for	the	rest	of	my	life	.
some	of	my	hypotheses	are	that	when	you	first	think	about	skeletal	muscle	,	there	's	a	lot	of	blood	vessels	going	to	skeletal	muscle	.
and	the	first	thing	that	makes	me	think	is	that	blood	vessels	are	like	highways	for	the	tumor	cells	.
tumor	cells	can	travel	through	the	blood	vessels	.
and	you	think	,	the	more	highways	there	are	in	a	tissue	,	the	more	likely	it	is	to	get	cancer	or	to	get	metastases	.
so	first	of	all	i	thought	,	you	know	,	``	would	n't	it	be	favorable	to	cancer	getting	to	skeletal	muscle	?	``	and	as	well	,	cancer	tumors	require	a	process	called	angiogenesis	,	which	is	really	,	the	tumor	recruits	the	blood	vessels	to	itself	to	supply	itself	with	nutrients	so	it	can	grow	.
without	angiogenesis	,	the	tumor	remains	the	size	of	a	pinpoint	and	it	's	not	harmful	.
so	angiogenesis	is	really	a	central	process	to	the	pathogenesis	of	cancer	.
and	one	article	that	really	stood	out	to	me	when	i	was	just	reading	about	this	,	trying	to	figure	out	why	cancer	does	n't	go	to	skeletal	muscle	,	was	that	it	had	reported	16	percent	of	micro	-	metastases	to	skeletal	muscle	upon	autopsy	.
16	percent	!	meaning	that	there	were	these	pinpoint	tumors	in	skeletal	muscle	,	but	only	.16	percent	of	actual	metastases	--	suggesting	that	maybe	skeletal	muscle	is	able	to	control	the	angiogenesis	,	is	able	to	control	the	tumors	recruiting	these	blood	vessels	.
we	use	skeletal	muscles	so	much	.	it	's	the	one	portion	of	our	body	--	our	heart	's	always	beating	.	we	're	always	moving	our	muscles	.
is	it	possible	that	muscle	somehow	intuitively	knows	that	it	needs	this	blood	supply	?	it	needs	to	be	constantly	contracting	,	so	therefore	it	's	almost	selfish	.	it	's	grabbing	its	blood	vessels	for	itself	.
therefore	,	when	a	tumor	comes	into	skeletal	muscle	tissue	,	it	ca	n't	get	a	blood	supply	,	and	ca	n't	grow	.
so	this	suggests	that	maybe	if	there	is	an	anti	-	angiogenic	factor	in	skeletal	muscle	--	or	perhaps	even	more	,	an	angiogenic	routing	factor	,	so	it	can	actually	direct	where	the	blood	vessels	grow	--	this	could	be	a	potential	future	therapy	for	cancer	.
and	another	thing	that	's	really	interesting	is	that	there	's	this	whole	--	the	way	tumors	move	throughout	the	body	,	it	's	a	very	complex	system	--	and	there	's	something	called	the	chemokine	network	.
and	chemokines	are	essentially	chemical	attractants	,	and	they	're	the	stop	and	go	signals	for	cancer	.
so	a	tumor	expresses	chemokine	receptors	,	and	another	organ	--	a	distant	organ	somewhere	in	the	body	--	will	have	the	corresponding	chemokines	,	and	the	tumor	will	see	these	chemokines	and	migrate	towards	it	.
is	it	possible	that	skeletal	muscle	does	n't	express	this	type	of	molecules	?
and	the	other	really	interesting	thing	is	that	when	skeletal	muscle	--	there	's	been	several	reports	that	when	skeletal	muscle	is	injured	,	that	's	what	correlates	with	metastases	going	to	skeletal	muscle	.
and	,	furthermore	,	when	skeletal	muscle	is	injured	,	that	's	what	causes	chemokines	--	these	signals	saying	,	``	cancer	,	you	can	come	to	me	,	``	the	``	go	signs	``	for	the	tumors	--	it	causes	them	to	highly	express	these	chemokines	.
so	,	there	's	so	much	interplay	here	.
i	mean	,	there	are	so	many	possibilities	for	why	tumors	do	n't	go	to	skeletal	muscle	.
but	it	seems	like	by	investigating	,	by	attacking	cancer	,	by	searching	where	cancer	is	not	,	there	has	got	to	be	something	--	there	's	got	to	be	something	--	that	's	making	this	tissue	resistant	to	tumors	.
and	can	we	utilize	--	can	we	take	this	property	,	this	compound	,	this	receptor	,	whatever	it	is	that	's	controlling	these	anti	-	tumor	properties	and	apply	it	to	cancer	therapy	in	general	?
now	,	one	thing	that	kind	of	ties	the	resistance	of	skeletal	muscle	to	cancer	--	to	the	cancer	as	a	repair	response	gone	out	of	control	in	the	body	--	is	that	skeletal	muscle	has	a	factor	in	it	called	``	myod	.	``
and	what	myod	essentially	does	is	,	it	causes	cells	to	differentiate	into	muscle	cells	.	so	this	compound	,	myod	,	has	been	tested	on	a	lot	of	different	cell	types	and	been	shown	to	actually	convert	this	variety	of	cell	types	into	skeletal	muscle	cells	.
so	,	is	it	possible	that	the	tumor	cells	are	going	to	the	skeletal	muscle	tissue	,	but	once	in	contact	inside	the	skeletal	muscle	tissue	,	myod	acts	upon	these	tumor	cells	and	causes	them	to	become	skeletal	muscle	cells	?
maybe	tumor	cells	are	being	disguised	as	skeletal	muscle	cells	,	and	this	is	why	it	seems	as	if	it	is	so	rare	.
it	's	not	harmful	;	it	has	just	repaired	the	muscle	.
muscle	is	constantly	being	used	--	constantly	being	damaged	.
if	every	time	we	tore	a	muscle	or	every	time	we	stretched	a	muscle	or	moved	in	a	wrong	way	,	cancer	occurred	--	i	mean	,	everybody	would	have	cancer	almost	.
and	i	hate	to	say	that	.	but	it	seems	as	though	muscle	cell	,	possibly	because	of	all	its	use	,	has	adapted	faster	than	other	body	tissues	to	respond	to	injury	,	to	fine	-	tune	this	repair	response	and	actually	be	able	to	finish	the	process	which	the	body	wants	to	finish	.	i	really	believe	that	the	human	body	is	very	,	very	smart	,	and	we	ca	n't	counteract	something	the	body	is	saying	to	do	.
it	's	different	when	a	bacteria	comes	into	the	body	--	that	's	a	foreign	object	--	we	want	that	out	.
but	when	the	body	is	actually	initiating	a	process	and	we	're	calling	it	a	disease	,	it	does	n't	seem	as	though	elimination	is	the	right	solution	.	so	even	to	go	from	there	,	it	's	possible	,	although	far	-	fetched	,	that	in	the	future	we	could	almost	think	of	cancer	being	used	as	a	therapy	.
if	those	diseases	where	tissues	are	deteriorating	--	for	example	alzheimer	's	,	where	the	brain	,	the	brain	cells	,	die	and	we	need	to	restore	new	brain	cells	,	new	functional	brain	cells	--	what	if	we	could	,	in	the	future	,	use	cancer	?	a	tumor	--	put	it	in	the	brain	and	cause	it	to	differentiate	into	brain	cells	?
that	's	a	very	far	-	fetched	idea	,	but	i	really	believe	that	it	may	be	possible	.
these	cells	are	so	versatile	,	these	cancer	cells	are	so	versatile	--	we	just	have	to	manipulate	them	in	the	right	way	.
and	again	,	some	of	these	may	be	far	-	fetched	,	but	i	figured	if	there	's	anywhere	to	present	far	-	fetched	ideas	,	it	's	here	at	ted	,	so	thank	you	very	much	.
