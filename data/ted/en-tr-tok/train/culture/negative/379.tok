you	hear	that	this	is	the	era	of	environment	--	or	biology	,	or	information	technology	...
well	,	it	's	the	era	of	a	lot	of	different	things	that	we	're	in	right	now	.	but	one	thing	for	sure	:	it	's	the	era	of	change	.	there	's	more	change	going	on	than	ever	has	occurred	in	the	history	of	human	life	on	earth	.
and	you	all	sort	of	know	it	,	but	it	's	hard	to	get	it	so	that	you	really	understand	it	.
and	i	've	tried	to	put	together	something	that	's	a	good	start	for	this	.
i	've	tried	to	show	in	this	--	though	the	color	does	n't	come	out	--	that	what	i	'm	concerned	with	is	the	little	50	-	year	time	bubble	that	you	are	in	.	you	tend	to	be	interested	in	a	generation	past	,	a	generation	future	--	your	parents	,	your	kids	,	things	you	can	change	over	the	next	few	decades	--	and	this	50	-	year	time	bubble	you	kind	of	move	along	in	.	and	in	that	50	years	,	if	you	look	at	the	population	curve	,	you	find	the	population	of	humans	on	the	earth	more	than	doubles	and	we	're	up	three	-	and	-	a	-	half	times	since	i	was	born	.	when	you	have	a	new	baby	,	by	the	time	that	kid	gets	out	of	high	school	more	people	will	be	added	than	existed	on	earth	when	i	was	born	.
this	is	unprecedented	,	and	it	's	big	.
where	it	goes	in	the	future	is	questioned	.	so	that	's	the	human	part	.
now	,	the	human	part	related	to	animals	:	look	at	the	left	side	of	that	.
what	i	call	the	human	portion	--	humans	and	their	livestock	and	pets	--	versus	the	natural	portion	--	all	the	other	wild	animals	and	just	--	these	are	vertebrates	and	all	the	birds	,	etc	.	,	in	the	land	and	air	,	not	in	the	water	.	how	does	it	balance	?
certainly	,	10,000	years	ago	,	the	civilization	's	beginning	,	the	human	portion	was	less	than	one	tenth	of	one	percent	.	let	's	look	at	it	now	.
you	follow	this	curve	and	you	see	the	whiter	spot	in	the	middle	--	that	's	your	50	-	year	time	bubble	.	humans	,	livestock	and	pets	are	now	97	percent	of	that	integrated	total	mass	on	earth	and	all	wild	nature	is	three	percent	.	we	have	won	.	the	next	generation	does	n't	even	have	to	worry	about	this	game	--	it	is	over	.
and	the	biggest	problem	came	in	the	last	25	years	:	it	went	from	25	percent	up	to	that	97	percent	.
and	this	really	is	a	sobering	picture	upon	realizing	that	we	,	humans	,	are	in	charge	of	life	on	earth	;	we	're	like	the	capricious	gods	of	old	greek	myths	,	kind	of	playing	with	life	--	and	not	a	great	deal	of	wisdom	injected	into	it	.
now	,	the	third	curve	is	information	technology	.
this	is	moore	's	law	plotted	here	,	which	relates	to	density	of	information	,	but	it	has	been	pretty	good	for	showing	a	lot	of	other	things	about	information	technology	--	computers	,	their	use	,	internet	,	etc	.	and	what	's	important	is	it	just	goes	straight	up	through	the	top	of	the	curve	,	and	has	no	real	limits	to	it	.	now	try	and	contrast	these	.
this	is	the	size	of	the	earth	going	through	that	same	--	--	frame	.	and	to	make	it	really	clear	,	i	've	put	all	four	on	one	graph	.
there	's	no	need	to	see	the	little	detailed	words	on	it	.
that	first	one	is	humans	-	versus	-	nature	;	we	've	won	,	there	's	no	more	gain	.	human	population	.
and	so	if	you	're	looking	for	growth	industries	to	get	into	,	that	's	not	a	good	one	--	protecting	natural	creatures	.	human	population	is	going	up	;	it	's	going	to	continue	for	quite	a	while	.
good	business	in	obstetricians	,	morticians	,	and	farming	,	housing	,	etc	.	--	they	all	deal	with	human	bodies	,	which	require	being	fed	,	transported	,	housed	and	so	on	.	and	the	information	technology	,	which	connects	to	our	brains	,	has	no	limit	--	now	,	that	is	a	wonderful	field	to	be	in	.	you	're	looking	for	growth	opportunity	?
it	's	just	going	up	through	the	roof	.
and	then	,	the	size	of	the	earth	.	somehow	making	these	all	compatible	with	the	earth	looks	like	a	pretty	bad	industry	to	be	involved	with	.
so	,	that	's	the	stage	out	of	all	this	.	i	find	,	for	reasons	i	do	n't	understand	,	i	really	do	have	a	goal	.
and	the	goal	is	that	the	world	be	desirable	and	sustainable	when	my	kids	reach	my	age	--	and	i	think	that	's	--	in	other	words	,	the	next	generation	.	i	think	that	's	a	goal	that	we	probably	all	share	.
i	think	it	's	a	hopeless	goal	.	technologically	,	it	's	achievable	;	economically	,	it	's	achievable	;	politically	,	it	means	sort	of	the	habits	,	institutions	of	people	--	it	's	impossible	.
the	institutions	of	the	past	with	all	their	inertia	are	just	irrelevant	for	the	future	,	except	they	're	there	and	we	have	to	deal	with	them	.	i	spend	about	15	percent	of	my	time	trying	to	save	the	world	,	the	other	85	percent	,	the	usual	--	and	whatever	else	we	devote	ourselves	to	.
and	in	that	15	percent	,	the	main	focus	is	on	human	mind	,	thinking	skills	,	somehow	trying	to	unleash	kids	from	the	straightjacket	of	school	,	which	is	putting	information	and	dogma	into	them	,	get	them	so	they	really	think	,	ask	tough	questions	,	argue	about	serious	subjects	,	do	n't	believe	everything	that	's	in	the	book	,	think	broadly	or	creative	.	they	can	be	.
our	school	systems	are	very	flawed	and	do	not	reward	you	for	the	things	that	are	important	in	life	or	for	the	survival	of	civilization	;	they	reward	you	for	a	lot	of	learning	and	sopping	up	stuff	.
we	ca	n't	go	into	that	today	because	there	is	n't	time	--	it	's	a	broad	subject	.	one	thing	for	sure	,	in	the	future	there	is	an	essential	feature	--	necessary	,	but	not	sufficient	--	which	is	doing	more	with	less	.	we	've	got	to	be	doing	things	with	more	efficiency	using	less	energy	,	less	material	.
your	great	-	great	grandparents	got	by	on	muscle	power	,	and	yet	we	all	think	there	's	this	huge	power	that	's	essential	for	our	lifestyle	.	and	with	all	the	wonderful	technology	we	have	we	can	do	things	that	are	much	more	efficient	:	conserve	,	recycle	,	etc	.
let	me	just	rush	very	quickly	through	things	that	we	've	done	.
human	-	powered	airplane	--	gossamer	condor	sort	of	started	me	in	this	direction	in	1976	and	77	,	winning	the	kremer	prize	in	aviation	history	,	followed	by	the	albatross	.	and	we	began	making	various	odd	planes	and	creatures	.
here	's	a	giant	flying	replica	of	a	pterosaur	that	has	no	tail	.
trying	to	have	it	fly	straight	is	like	trying	to	shoot	an	arrow	with	the	feathered	end	forward	.	it	was	a	tough	job	,	and	boy	it	made	me	have	a	lot	of	respect	for	nature	.
this	was	the	full	size	of	the	original	creature	.
we	did	things	on	land	,	in	the	air	,	on	water	--	vehicles	of	all	different	kinds	,	usually	with	some	electronics	or	electric	power	systems	in	them	.	i	find	they	're	all	the	same	,	whether	its	land	,	air	or	water	.
i	'll	be	focusing	on	the	air	here	.	this	is	a	solar	-	powered	airplane	--	165	miles	carrying	a	person	from	france	to	england	as	a	symbol	that	solar	power	is	going	to	be	an	important	part	of	our	future	.	then	we	did	the	solar	car	for	general	motors	--	the	sunracer	--	that	won	the	race	in	australia	.
we	got	a	lot	of	people	thinking	about	electric	cars	,	what	you	could	do	with	them	.	a	few	years	later	,	when	we	suggested	to	gm	that	now	is	the	time	and	we	could	do	a	thing	called	the	impact	,	they	sponsored	it	,	and	here	's	the	impact	that	we	developed	with	them	on	their	programs	.	this	is	the	demonstrator	.	and	they	put	huge	effort	into	turning	it	into	a	commercial	product	.
with	that	preamble	,	let	's	show	the	first	two	-	minute	videotape	,	which	shows	a	little	airplane	for	surveillance	and	moving	to	a	giant	airplane	.
narrator	:	a	tiny	airplane	,	the	av	pointer	serves	for	surveillance	--	in	effect	,	a	pair	of	roving	eyeglasses	.	a	cutting	-	edge	example	of	where	miniaturization	can	lead	if	the	operator	is	remote	from	the	vehicle	.	it	is	convenient	to	carry	,	assemble	and	launch	by	hand	.	battery	-	powered	,	it	is	silent	and	rarely	noticed	.
it	sends	high	-	resolution	video	pictures	back	to	the	operator	.
with	onboard	gps	,	it	can	navigate	autonomously	,	and	it	is	rugged	enough	to	self	-	land	without	damage	.
the	modern	sailplane	is	superbly	efficient	.
some	can	glide	as	flat	as	60	feet	forward	for	every	foot	of	descent	.
they	are	powered	only	by	the	energy	they	can	extract	from	the	atmosphere	--	an	atmosphere	nature	stirs	up	by	solar	energy	.
humans	and	soaring	birds	have	found	nature	to	be	generous	in	providing	replenishable	energy	.	sailplanes	have	flown	over	1,000	miles	,	and	the	altitude	record	is	over	50,000	feet	.
the	solar	challenger	was	made	to	serve	as	a	symbol	that	photovoltaic	cells	can	produce	real	power	and	will	be	part	of	the	world	's	energy	future	.
in	1981	,	it	flew	163	miles	from	paris	to	england	,	solely	on	the	power	of	sunbeams	,	and	established	a	basis	for	the	pathfinder	.
the	message	from	all	these	vehicles	is	that	ideas	and	technology	can	be	harnessed	to	produce	remarkable	gains	in	doing	more	with	less	--	gains	that	can	help	us	attain	a	desirable	balance	between	technology	and	nature	.	the	stakes	are	high	as	we	speed	toward	a	challenging	future	.
buckminster	fuller	said	it	clearly	:	``	there	are	no	passengers	on	spaceship	earth	,	only	crew	.	we	,	the	crew	,	can	and	must	do	more	with	less	--	much	less	.	``
paul	maccready	:	if	we	could	have	the	second	video	,	the	one	-	minute	,	put	in	as	quickly	as	you	can	,	which	--	this	will	show	the	pathfinder	airplane	in	some	flights	this	past	year	in	hawaii	,	and	will	show	a	sequence	of	some	of	the	beauty	behind	it	after	it	had	just	flown	to	71,530	feet	--	higher	than	any	propeller	airplane	has	ever	flown	.
it	's	amazing	:	just	on	the	puny	power	of	the	sun	--	by	having	a	super	lightweight	plane	,	you	're	able	to	get	it	up	there	.
it	's	part	of	a	long	-	term	program	nasa	sponsored	.
and	we	worked	very	closely	with	the	whole	thing	being	a	team	effort	,	and	with	wonderful	results	like	that	flight	.
and	we	're	working	on	a	bigger	plane	--	220	-	foot	span	--	and	an	intermediate	-	size	,	one	with	a	regenerative	fuel	cell	that	can	store	excess	energy	during	the	day	,	feed	it	back	at	night	,	and	stay	up	65,000	feet	for	months	at	a	time	.
ray	morgan	's	voice	will	come	in	here	.
there	he	's	the	project	manager	.	anything	they	do	is	certainly	a	team	effort	.	he	ran	this	program	.	here	's	...
some	things	he	showed	as	a	celebration	at	the	very	end	.
ray	morgan	:	we	'd	just	ended	a	seven	-	month	deployment	of	hawaii	.
for	those	who	live	on	the	mainland	,	it	was	tough	being	away	from	home	.
the	friendly	support	,	the	quiet	confidence	,	congenial	hospitality	shown	by	our	hawaiian	and	military	hosts	--	this	is	starting	--	made	the	experience	enjoyable	and	unforgettable	.
pm	:	we	have	real	-	time	ir	scans	going	out	through	the	internet	while	the	plane	is	flying	.	and	it	's	exploring	without	polluting	the	stratosphere	.	that	's	its	goal	:	the	stratosphere	,	the	blanket	that	really	controls	the	radiation	of	the	earth	and	permits	life	on	earth	to	be	the	success	that	it	is	--	probing	that	is	very	important	.	and	also	we	consider	it	as	a	sort	of	poor	man	's	stationary	satellite	,	because	it	can	stay	right	overhead	for	months	at	a	time	,	2,000	times	closer	than	the	real	gfc	synchronous	satellite	.
we	could	n't	bring	one	here	to	fly	it	and	show	you	.
but	now	let	's	look	at	the	other	end	.
in	the	video	you	saw	that	nine	-	pound	or	eight	-	pound	pointer	airplane	surveillance	drone	that	keenan	has	developed	and	just	done	a	remarkable	job	.	where	some	have	servos	that	have	gotten	down	to	,	oh	,	18	or	25	grams	,	his	weigh	one	-	third	of	a	gram	.	and	what	he	's	going	to	bring	out	here	is	a	surveillance	drone	that	weighs	about	2	ounces	--	that	includes	the	video	camera	,	the	batteries	that	run	it	,	the	telemetry	,	the	receiver	and	so	on	.	and	we	'll	fly	it	,	we	hope	,	with	the	same	success	that	we	had	last	night	when	we	did	the	practice	.
so	matt	keenan	,	just	any	time	you	're	--	all	right	--	ready	to	let	her	go	.	but	first	,	we	're	going	to	make	sure	that	it	's	appearing	on	the	screen	,	so	you	see	what	it	sees	.
you	can	imagine	yourself	being	a	mouse	or	fly	inside	of	it	,	looking	out	of	its	camera	.
matt	keenan	:	it	's	switched	on	.
pm	:	but	now	we	're	trying	to	get	the	video	.	there	we	go	.
mk	:	can	you	bring	up	the	house	lights	?
pm	:	yeah	,	the	house	lights	and	we	'll	see	you	all	better	and	be	able	to	fly	the	plane	better	.
mk	:	all	right	,	we	'll	try	to	do	a	few	laps	around	and	bring	it	back	in	.
here	we	go	.
pm	:	the	video	worked	right	for	the	first	few	and	i	do	n't	know	why	it	--	there	it	goes	.
oh	,	that	was	only	a	minute	,	but	i	think	you	'd	be	safe	to	have	that	near	the	end	of	the	flight	,	perhaps	.
we	get	to	do	the	classic	.
all	right	.
if	this	hits	you	,	it	will	not	hurt	you	.
ok	.
thank	you	very	much	.	thank	you	.
but	now	,	as	they	say	in	infomercials	,	we	have	something	much	better	for	you	,	which	we	're	working	on	:	planes	that	are	only	six	inches	--	15	centimeters	--	in	size	.
and	matt	's	plane	was	on	the	cover	of	popular	science	last	month	,	showing	what	this	can	lead	to	.	and	in	a	while	,	something	this	size	will	have	gps	and	a	video	camera	in	it	.	we	've	had	one	of	these	fly	nine	miles	through	the	air	at	35	miles	an	hour	with	just	a	little	battery	in	it	.
but	there	's	a	lot	of	technology	going	.
there	are	just	milestones	along	the	way	of	some	remarkable	things	.
this	one	does	n't	have	the	video	in	it	,	but	you	get	a	little	feel	from	what	it	can	do	.
ok	,	here	we	go	.
mk	:	sorry	.
ok	.
pm	:	if	you	can	pass	it	down	when	you	're	done	.	yeah	,	i	think	--	i	lost	a	little	orientation	;	i	looked	up	into	this	light	.
it	hit	the	building	.	and	the	building	was	poorly	placed	,	actually	.
but	you	're	beginning	to	see	what	can	be	done	.
we	're	working	on	projects	now	--	even	wing	-	flapping	things	the	size	of	hawk	moths	--	darpa	contracts	,	working	with	caltech	,	ucla	.
where	all	this	leads	,	i	do	n't	know	.	is	it	practical	?	i	do	n't	know	.
but	like	any	basic	research	,	when	you	're	really	forced	to	do	things	that	are	way	beyond	existing	technology	,	you	can	get	there	with	micro	-	technology	,	nanotechnology	.
you	can	do	amazing	things	when	you	realize	what	nature	has	been	doing	all	along	.	as	you	get	to	these	small	scales	,	you	realize	we	have	a	lot	to	learn	from	nature	--	not	with	747s	--	but	when	you	get	down	to	the	nature	's	realm	,	nature	has	200	million	years	of	experience	.
it	never	makes	a	mistake	.	because	if	you	make	a	mistake	,	you	do	n't	leave	any	progeny	.
we	should	have	nothing	but	success	stories	from	nature	,	for	you	or	for	birds	,	and	we	're	learning	a	lot	from	its	fascinating	subjects	.
in	concluding	,	i	want	to	get	back	to	the	big	picture	and	i	have	just	two	final	slides	to	try	and	put	it	in	perspective	.
the	first	i	'll	just	read	.	at	last	,	i	put	in	three	sentences	and	had	it	say	what	i	wanted	.
over	billions	of	years	on	a	unique	sphere	,	chance	has	painted	a	thin	covering	of	life	--	complex	,	improbable	,	wonderful	and	fragile	.	suddenly	,	we	humans	--	a	recently	arrived	species	,	no	longer	subject	to	the	checks	and	balances	inherent	in	nature	--	have	grown	in	population	,	technology	and	intelligence	to	a	position	of	terrible	power	.	we	now	wield	the	paintbrush	.
and	that	's	serious	:	we	're	not	very	bright	.	we	're	short	on	wisdom	;	we	're	high	on	technology	.	where	's	it	going	to	lead	?
well	,	inspired	by	the	sentences	,	i	decided	to	wield	the	paintbrush	.
every	25	years	i	do	a	picture	.	here	's	the	one	--	tries	to	show	that	the	world	is	n't	getting	any	bigger	.
sort	of	a	timeline	,	very	non	-	linear	scale	,	nature	rates	and	trilobites	and	dinosaurs	,	and	eventually	we	saw	some	humans	with	caves	...	birds	were	flying	overhead	,	after	pterosaurs	.
and	then	we	get	to	the	civilization	above	the	little	tv	set	with	a	gun	on	it	.	then	traffic	jams	,	and	power	systems	,	and	some	dots	for	digital	.	where	it	's	going	to	lead	--	i	have	no	idea	.
and	so	i	just	put	robotic	and	natural	cockroaches	out	there	,	but	you	can	fill	in	whatever	you	want	.	this	is	not	a	forecast	.
this	is	a	warning	,	and	we	have	to	think	seriously	about	it	.
and	that	time	when	this	is	happening	is	not	100	years	or	500	years	.
things	are	going	on	this	decade	,	next	decade	;	it	's	a	very	short	time	that	we	have	to	decide	what	we	are	going	to	do	.
and	if	we	can	get	some	agreement	on	where	we	want	the	world	to	be	--	desirable	,	sustainable	when	your	kids	reach	your	age	--	i	think	we	actually	can	reach	it	.	now	,	i	said	this	was	a	warning	,	not	a	forecast	.	that	was	before	--	i	painted	this	before	we	started	in	on	making	robotic	versions	of	hawk	moths	and	cockroaches	,	and	now	i	'm	beginning	to	wonder	seriously	--	was	this	more	of	a	forecast	than	i	wanted	?
i	personally	think	the	surviving	intelligent	life	form	on	earth	is	not	going	to	be	carbon	-	based	;	it	's	going	to	be	silicon	-	based	.
and	so	where	it	all	goes	,	i	do	n't	know	.
the	one	final	bit	of	sparkle	we	'll	put	in	at	the	very	end	here	is	an	utterly	impractical	flight	vehicle	,	which	is	a	little	ornithopter	wing	-	flapping	device	that	--	rubber	-	band	powered	--	that	we	'll	show	you	.
mk	:	32	gram	.	sorry	,	one	gram	.
pm	:	last	night	we	gave	it	a	few	too	many	turns	and	it	tried	to	bash	the	roof	out	also	.	it	's	about	a	gram	.
the	tube	there	's	hollow	,	about	paper	-	thin	.
and	if	this	lands	on	you	,	i	assure	you	it	will	not	hurt	you	.
but	if	you	reach	out	to	grab	it	or	hold	it	,	you	will	destroy	it	.
so	,	be	gentle	,	just	act	like	a	wooden	indian	or	something	.
and	when	it	comes	down	--	and	we	'll	see	how	it	goes	.
we	consider	this	to	be	sort	of	the	spirit	of	ted	.
and	you	wonder	,	is	it	practical	?	and	it	turns	out	if	i	had	not	been	--	unfortunately	,	we	have	some	light	bulb	changes	.
we	can	probably	get	it	down	,	but	it	's	possible	it	's	gone	up	to	a	greater	destiny	up	there	--	--	than	it	ever	had	.	and	i	wanted	to	make	--	just	--	but	i	want	to	make	just	two	points	.	one	is	,	you	think	it	's	frivolous	;	there	's	nothing	to	it	.	and	yet	if	i	had	not	been	making	ornithopters	like	that	,	a	little	bit	cruder	,	in	1939	--	a	long	,	long	time	ago	--	there	would	n't	have	been	a	gossamer	condor	,	there	would	n't	have	been	an	albatross	,	a	solar	challenger	,	there	would	n't	be	an	impact	car	,	there	would	n't	be	a	mandate	on	zero	-	emission	vehicles	in	california	.
a	lot	of	these	things	--	or	similar	--	would	have	happened	some	time	,	probably	a	decade	later	.	i	did	n't	realize	at	the	time	i	was	doing	inquiry	-	based	,	hands	-	on	things	with	teams	,	like	they	're	trying	to	get	in	education	systems	.
so	i	think	that	,	as	a	symbol	,	it	's	important	.
and	i	believe	that	also	is	important	.	you	can	think	of	it	as	a	sort	of	a	symbol	for	learning	and	ted	that	somehow	gets	you	thinking	of	technology	and	nature	,	and	puts	it	all	together	in	things	that	are	--	that	make	this	conference	,	i	think	,	more	important	than	any	that	's	taken	place	in	this	country	in	this	decade	.
thank	you	.
