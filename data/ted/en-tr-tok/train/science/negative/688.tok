one	day	a	one	-	eyed	monkey	came	into	the	forest	.
under	a	tree	she	saw	a	woman	the	one	-	eyed	monkey	recognized	the	woman	,	a	sekhri	.
she	was	the	wife	of	an	even	more	famous	brahmin	.
to	watch	her	better	,	the	one	-	eyed	monkey	climbed	onto	the	tree	.
just	then	,	with	a	loud	bang	,	the	heavens	opened	.
and	the	god	indra	jumped	into	the	clearing	.
indra	saw	the	woman	,	a	sekhri	.
ah	-	hah	.
the	woman	paid	him	no	heed	.
so	,	indra	,	attracted	,	threw	her	onto	the	floor	,	and	proceeded	to	rape	her	.
then	indra	disappeared	.
and	the	woman	's	husband	,	the	brahmin	,	appeared	.
he	realized	at	once	what	had	happened	.
so	,	he	petitioned	the	higher	gods	so	that	he	may	have	justice	.
so	,	the	god	vishnu	arrived	.
``	are	there	any	witnesses	?	``
``	just	a	one	-	eyed	monkey	,	``	said	the	brahmin	.
now	,	the	one	-	eyed	monkey	really	wanted	for	the	woman	,	a	sekhri	,	to	get	justice	,	so	she	retold	events	exactly	as	they	had	happened	.
vishnu	gave	his	judgment	.
``	the	god	indra	has	sinned	,	in	that	he	has	sinned	against	...	a	brahmin	.
may	he	be	called	to	wash	away	his	sins	.	``
so	,	indra	arrived	,	and	performed	the	sacrifice	of	the	horse	.
and	so	it	transpired	that	a	horse	was	killed	,	a	god	was	made	sin	-	free	,	a	brahmin	's	ego	was	appeased	,	a	woman	...	was	ruined	,	and	a	one	-	eyed	monkey	was	left	...
very	confused	at	what	we	humans	call	justice	.
in	india	there	is	a	rape	every	three	minutes	.
in	india	,	only	25	percent	of	rapes	come	to	a	police	station	,	and	of	these	25	percent	that	come	to	a	police	station	,	convictions	are	only	in	four	percent	of	the	cases	.
that	's	a	lot	of	women	who	do	n't	get	justice	.
and	it	's	not	only	about	women	.
look	around	you	,	look	at	your	own	countries	.
there	is	a	certain	pattern	in	who	gets	charged	with	crimes	.
if	you	're	in	australia	,	it	's	mostly	aboriginals	who	are	in	jail	.
if	you	're	in	india	,	it	's	either	muslims	or	adivasis	,	our	tribals	,	the	naxalites	.
if	you	're	in	the	u.s.	,	it	's	mostly	the	blacks	.
there	is	a	trend	here	.
and	the	brahmins	and	the	gods	,	like	in	my	story	,	always	get	to	tell	their	truth	as	the	truth	.
so	,	have	we	all	become	one	-	eyed	--	two	-	eyed	instead	of	one	-	eyed	--	monkeys	?
have	we	stopped	seeing	injustice	?
good	morning	.
you	know	,	i	have	told	this	story	close	to	550	times	,	in	audiences	in	40	countries	,	to	school	students	,	to	black	-	tie	dinners	at	the	smithsonian	,	and	so	on	and	so	forth	,	and	every	time	it	hits	something	.
now	,	if	i	were	to	go	into	the	same	crowd	and	say	,	``	i	want	to	lecture	you	about	justice	and	injustice	,	``	they	would	say	,	``	thank	you	very	much	,	we	have	other	things	to	do	.	``
and	that	is	the	astonishing	power	of	art	.
art	can	go	through	where	other	things	ca	n't	.
you	ca	n't	have	barriers	,	because	it	breaks	through	your	prejudices	,	breaks	through	everything	that	you	have	as	your	mask	,	that	says	,	``	i	am	this	,	i	am	that	,	i	am	that	.	``
no	.	it	breaks	through	those	.
and	it	reaches	somewhere	where	other	things	do	n't	.
and	in	a	world	where	attitudes	are	so	difficult	to	change	,	we	need	a	language	that	reaches	through	.
hitler	knew	it	;	he	used	wagner	to	make	all	the	nazis	feel	wonderful	and	aryan	.
and	mr.	berlusconi	knows	it	,	as	he	sits	atop	this	huge	empire	of	media	and	television	and	so	on	and	so	forth	.
and	all	of	the	wonderful	creative	minds	who	are	in	all	the	advertising	agencies	,	and	who	help	corporate	sell	us	things	we	absolutely	do	n't	require	,	they	also	know	the	power	of	the	arts	.
for	me	it	came	very	early	.
when	i	was	a	young	child	,	my	mother	,	who	was	a	choreographer	,	came	upon	a	phenomenon	that	worried	her	.
it	was	a	phenomenon	where	young	brides	were	committing	suicide	in	rural	gujarat	,	because	they	were	being	forced	to	bring	more	and	more	money	for	their	in	-	laws	'	families	.
and	she	created	a	dance	piece	which	then	prime	minister	nehru	saw	.
he	came	to	talk	to	her	and	said	,	``	what	is	this	about	?	``
she	told	him	and	he	set	out	the	first	inquiry	into	what	today	we	call	dowry	dance	.
imagine	a	dance	piece	for	the	first	inquiry	into	something	that	even	today	kills	thousands	of	women	.
many	years	later	,	when	i	was	working	with	the	director	peter	brook	in	``	the	mahabharata	``	playing	this	feisty	feminine	feminist	called	draupadi	,	i	had	similar	experiences	.
big	fat	black	mamas	in	the	bronx	used	to	come	and	say	,	``	hey	girl	,	that	's	it	!	``
and	then	these	trendy	young	things	in	the	sorbonne	would	say	,	``	madame	draupadi	,	on	n'est	pas	feministe	,	mais	ça	?	ça	!	``
and	then	aboriginal	women	in	africa	would	come	and	say	,	``	this	is	it	!	``
and	i	thought	,	``	this	is	what	we	need	,	as	a	language	.	``
we	had	somebody	from	public	health	.	and	devdutt	also	mentioned	public	health	.
well	,	millions	of	people	around	the	world	die	of	waterborne	disease	every	year	.
and	that	's	because	there	is	no	clean	water	to	drink	,	or	in	countries	like	india	,	people	do	n't	know	that	they	need	to	soap	their	hands	before	defecation	.
so	,	what	do	they	do	?
they	drink	the	water	they	know	is	dirty	,	they	get	cholera	,	they	get	diarrhea	,	they	get	jaundice	and	they	die	.
and	governments	have	not	been	able	to	provide	clean	water	.
they	try	and	build	it	.	they	try	and	build	pipelines	;	it	does	n't	happen	.
and	the	mncs	give	them	machines	that	they	can	not	afford	.
so	what	do	you	do	?	do	you	let	them	die	?
well	,	somebody	had	a	great	idea	.
and	it	was	a	simple	idea	.	it	was	an	idea	that	could	not	profit	anybody	but	would	help	health	in	every	field	.
most	houses	in	asia	and	india	have	a	cotton	garment	.
and	it	was	discovered	,	and	who	endorses	this	,	that	a	clean	cotton	garment	folded	eight	times	over	,	can	reduce	bacteria	up	to	80	percent	from	water	sieved	through	.
so	,	why	are	n't	governments	blaring	this	on	television	?
why	is	n't	it	on	every	poster	across	the	third	world	?
because	there	is	no	profit	in	it	.
because	nobody	can	get	a	kickback	.
but	it	still	needs	to	get	to	people	.
and	here	is	one	of	the	ways	we	get	it	to	people	.
[	video	]	woman	:	then	get	me	one	of	those	fancy	water	purifiers	.
man	:	you	know	how	expensive	those	are	.
i	have	a	solution	that	requires	neither	machine	,	nor	wood	,	nor	cooking	gas	.
woman	:	what	solution	?
man	:	listen	,	go	fetch	that	cotton	sari	you	have	.
boy	:	grand	-	dad	,	tell	me	the	solution	please	.
man	:	i	will	tell	all	of	you	.	just	wait	.
woman	:	here	father	.	woman	:	yes	,	of	course	.
man	:	then	do	as	i	tell	you	.	fold	the	sari	into	eight	folds	.
woman	:	all	right	,	father	.
man	:	and	you	,	you	count	that	she	does	it	right	.
man	:	one	,	two	,	three	,	four	folds	we	make	.
all	the	germs	from	the	water	we	take	.
chorus	:	one	,	two	,	three	,	four	folds	we	make	.
all	the	germs	from	the	water	we	take	.
five	,	six	,	seven	,	eight	folds	we	make	.
our	drinking	water	safe	we	make	.
five	,	six	,	seven	,	eight	folds	we	make	.
our	drinking	water	safe	we	make	.
woman	:	here	,	father	,	your	eight	-	times	folded	cotton	sari	.
man	:	so	this	is	the	cotton	sari	.
and	through	this	we	will	have	clean	water	.
i	think	it	's	safe	to	say	that	all	of	us	here	are	deeply	concerned	about	the	escalating	violence	in	our	daily	lives	.
while	universities	are	trying	to	devise	courses	in	conflict	resolution	,	and	governments	are	trying	to	stop	skirmishes	at	borders	,	we	are	surrounded	by	violence	,	whether	it	's	road	rage	,	or	whether	it	's	domestic	violence	,	whether	it	's	a	teacher	beating	up	a	student	and	killing	her	because	she	has	n't	done	her	homework	,	it	's	everywhere	.
so	,	why	are	we	not	doing	something	to	actually	attend	that	problem	on	a	day	to	day	basis	?
what	are	we	doing	to	try	and	make	children	and	young	people	realize	that	violence	is	something	that	we	indulge	in	,	that	we	can	stop	,	and	that	there	are	other	ways	of	actually	taking	violence	,	taking	anger	,	taking	frustrations	into	different	things	that	do	not	harm	other	people	.
well	,	here	is	one	such	way	.
you	are	peaceful	people	.
your	parents	were	peaceful	people	.
your	grandparents	were	peaceful	people	.
so	much	peace	in	one	place	?
how	could	it	be	otherwise	?
but	,	what	if	...
yes	.	what	if	...
one	little	gene	in	you	has	been	trying	to	get	through	?
from	your	beginnings	in	africa	,	through	each	generation	,	may	be	passed	on	to	you	,	in	your	creation	.	it	's	a	secret	urge	,	hiding	deep	in	you	.
and	if	it	's	in	you	,	then	it	's	in	me	too	.	oh	,	dear	.
it	's	what	made	you	smack	your	baby	brother	,	stamp	on	a	cockroach	,	scratch	your	mother	.
it	's	the	feeling	that	wells	up	from	deep	inside	,	when	your	husband	comes	home	drunk	and	you	wan	na	tan	his	hide	.
want	to	kill	that	cyclist	on	the	way	to	work	,	and	string	up	your	cousin	'	cause	she	's	such	a	jerk	.	oh	,	dear	.
and	as	for	outsiders	,	white	,	black	or	brown	,	tar	and	feather	them	,	and	whip	them	out	of	town	.
it	's	that	little	gene	.	it	's	small	and	it	's	mean	.
too	small	for	detection	,	it	's	your	built	-	in	protection	.
adrenaline	,	kill	.	it	'll	give	you	the	will	.
yes	,	you	'd	better	face	it	'	cause	you	ca	n't	displace	it	.
you	're	v	-	i	-	o	-	l	-	e	-	n	-	t	.
cause	you	're	either	a	victim	,	or	on	top	,	like	me	.
goodbye	,	abraham	lincoln	.
goodbye	,	mahatma	gandhi	.
goodbye	,	martin	luther	king	.
hello	,	gangs	from	this	neighborhood	killing	gangs	from	that	neighborhood	.
hello	governments	of	rich	countries	selling	arms	to	governments	of	poor	countries	who	ca	n't	even	afford	to	give	them	food	.
hello	civilization	.	hello	,	21st	century	.
look	what	we	've	...
look	what	they	've	done	.
mainstream	art	,	cinema	,	has	been	used	across	the	world	to	talk	about	social	issues	.
a	few	years	ago	we	had	a	film	called	rang	de	basanti	,	which	suddenly	spawned	thousands	of	young	people	wanting	to	volunteer	for	social	change	.
in	venezuela	,	one	of	the	most	popular	soap	operas	has	a	heroine	called	crystal	.
and	when	,	onscreen	,	crystal	got	breast	cancer	,	75,000	more	young	women	went	to	have	mammographies	done	.
and	of	course	,	``	the	vagina	monologues	``	we	know	about	.
and	there	are	stand	-	up	comics	who	are	talking	about	racial	issues	,	about	ethnic	issues	.
so	,	why	is	it	,	that	if	we	think	that	we	all	agree	that	we	need	a	better	world	,	we	need	a	more	just	world	,	why	is	it	that	we	are	not	using	the	one	language	that	has	consistently	showed	us	that	we	can	break	down	barriers	,	that	we	can	reach	people	?
what	i	need	to	say	to	the	planners	of	the	world	,	the	governments	,	the	strategists	is	,	``	you	have	treated	the	arts	as	the	cherry	on	the	cake	.
it	needs	to	be	the	yeast	.	``
because	,	any	future	planning	,	if	2048	is	when	we	want	to	get	there	,	unless	the	arts	are	put	with	the	scientists	,	with	the	economists	,	with	all	those	who	prepare	for	the	future	,	badly	,	we	're	not	going	to	get	there	.
and	unless	this	is	actually	internalized	,	it	wo	n't	happen	.
so	,	what	is	it	that	we	require	?	what	is	it	that	we	need	?
we	need	to	break	down	our	vision	of	what	planners	are	,	of	what	the	correct	way	of	a	path	is	.
and	to	say	all	these	years	of	trying	to	make	a	better	world	,	and	we	have	failed	.
there	are	more	people	being	raped	.	there	are	more	wars	.
there	are	more	people	dying	of	simple	things	.
so	,	something	has	got	to	give	.	and	that	is	what	i	want	.
can	i	have	my	last	audio	track	please	?
once	there	was	a	princess	who	whistled	beautifully	.
her	father	the	king	said	,	``	do	n't	whistle	.	``
her	mother	the	queen	said	,	``	hai	,	do	n't	whistle	.	``
but	the	princess	continued	whistling	.
the	years	went	by	and	the	princess	grew	up	into	a	beautiful	young	woman	,	who	whistled	even	more	beautifully	.
her	father	the	king	said	,	``	who	will	marry	a	whistling	princess	?	``
her	mother	the	queen	said	,	``	who	will	marry	a	whistling	princess	?	``
but	the	king	had	an	idea	.
he	announced	a	swayamvara	.
he	invited	all	the	princes	to	come	and	defeat	his	daughter	at	whistling	.
``	whoever	defeats	my	daughter	shall	have	half	my	kingdom	and	her	hand	in	marriage	!	``
soon	the	palace	filled	with	princes	whistling	.
some	whistled	badly	.
some	whistled	well	.
but	nobody	could	defeat	the	princess	.
``	now	what	shall	we	do	?	``	said	the	king	.
``	now	what	shall	we	do	?	``	said	the	queen	.
but	the	princess	said	,	``	father	,	mother	,	do	n't	worry	.
i	have	an	idea	.	i	am	going	to	go	to	each	of	these	young	men	and	i	am	going	to	ask	them	if	they	defeated	correctly	.
and	if	somebody	answers	,	that	shall	be	my	wish	.	``
so	she	went	up	to	each	and	said	,	``	do	you	accept	that	i	have	defeated	you	?	``
and	they	said	,	``	me	?	defeated	by	a	woman	?
no	way	,	that	's	impossible	!	no	no	no	no	no	!	that	's	not	possible	.	``
till	finally	one	prince	said	,	``	princess	,	i	accept	,	you	have	defeated	me	.	``
``	uh	-	huh	.	.	.	``	she	said	.
``	father	,	mother	,	this	man	shall	be	my	wife	.	``
thank	you	.
