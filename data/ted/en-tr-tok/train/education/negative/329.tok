ninety	-	nine	percent	of	us	have	the	dream	of	listeners	.
not	being	the	musicians	--	the	listeners	,	right	?
and	we	crave	one	thing	,	even	though	we	kind	of	do	n't	know	it	all	the	time	.
we	crave	to	be	in	the	room	with	the	musician	the	day	it	was	recorded	,	the	day	it	was	played	.
and	we	go	to	live	concerts	,	and	we	get	that	as	much	as	we	can	.
but	then	we	listen	to	the	other	99	percent	of	our	stuff	recorded	.
and	it	turns	out	the	further	back	you	go	in	history	,	the	little	rougher	it	sounds	.
and	so	we	said	,	there	's	a	solution	to	this	.
let	's	separate	the	performance	,	as	a	thing	,	out	from	the	recording	,	which	was	how	it	was	made	.
you	know	,	the	thing	with	microphones	in	the	room	and	all	that	day	.
but	the	performance	itself	was	how	the	musicians	worked	their	fingers	,	and	what	instruments	they	were	using	.
and	it	's	the	data	hidden	inside	the	recording	.
in	order	to	do	this	,	it	's	a	lot	of	hardware	and	software	that	runs	in	a	very	high	resolution	.
and	yamaha	makes	an	incredible	thing	called	the	disklavier	pro	that	looks	like	a	nice	grand	piano	there	.
and	you	probably	did	n't	realize	it	's	going	to	do	all	these	things	--	but	full	of	solenoids	,	and	fiber	optics	,	and	computers	and	all	this	kind	of	stuff	.	the	highest	resolution	out	of	japan	.
and	this	just	did	n't	work	until	we	could	cross	this	line	that	says	high	-	definition	.
and	we	were	able	to	cross	this	line	,	called	the	uncanny	valley	,	in	terms	of	--	artificial	intelligence	terms	.
we	have	a	process	where	we	,	you	know	,	kind	of	put	it	into	the	computer	and	digitize	it	,	and	then	a	whole	lot	of	analysis	.
and	we	look	at	every	single	note	,	and	all	the	attributes	of	those	notes	:	how	hard	they	were	struck	,	and	how	they	were	held	down	,	and	how	you	move	the	fingers	.
so	we	had	to	develop	a	whole	new	science	of	how	you	move	your	fingers	.
and	,	you	know	,	it	's	a	thing	your	piano	teacher	teaches	you	,	but	we	never	had	a	science	behind	these	kinds	of	things	.
i	'm	going	to	start	with	glenn	gould	.
he	died	25	years	ago	this	year	,	and	was	born	75	years	ago	this	year	.
was	a	beloved	pianist	,	maybe	the	great	cult	pianist	of	the	twentieth	century	.
he	just	got	tired	of	being	in	front	of	an	audience	,	and	felt	like	--	a	performing	monkey	was	,	in	fact	,	his	term	.
so	he	stepped	back	,	and	did	nothing	but	the	crafting	of	his	work	.
and	gould	's	specialty	was	playing	bach	.
his	maybe	most	famous	recording	was	something	called	``	the	goldberg	variations	.	``
bach	only	wrote	themes	and	variations	one	time	.
he	wrote	some	early	pieces	,	but	late	in	his	life	,	in	his	mature	period	,	he	said	,	``	here	's	a	theme	--	30	variations	.	``
in	fact	,	the	theme	is	n't	even	the	melody	,	it	's	the	bass	line	.
and	gould	recorded	it	in	two	major	recordings	that	you	may	know	about	,	one	in	mono	,	and	one	in	stereo	.
and	the	one	in	mono	,	by	the	way	,	he	used	the	pedal	,	and	as	he	got	older	,	he	said	,	``	no	,	no	,	wait	a	minute	.
i	'm	going	to	get	very	scientific	about	this	,	and	not	use	the	pedal	.	``
what	i	'd	like	you	to	hear	live	is	the	1955	version	,	and	we	'll	play	the	first	couple	pieces	of	it	.
glenn	gould	,	1955	.
how	about	that	?
so	let	me	tell	you	a	little	bit	how	this	was	done	.
first	of	all	,	let	me	get	you	to	the	end	step	.
this	is	--	we	have	a	fairly	complex	process	that	,	you	know	,	software	and	musicians	and	so	on	,	but	when	we	're	all	done	,	we	know	that	the	ear	is	the	final	arbiter	.
we	can	play	the	original	in	one	ear	,	and	a	new	recording	in	the	other	.
so	i	'm	going	to	do	this	for	you	right	now	,	what	you	just	heard	.
and	in	the	right	speaker	is	going	to	be	the	original	recording	,	and	the	left	speaker	is	going	to	be	the	new	recording	,	actually	of	an	instrument	just	like	that	one	,	and	i	'm	going	to	play	them	together	at	the	same	time	.
that	's	the	original	.	[	unclear	]	that	's	the	two	together	.
before	``	jurassic	park	,	``	there	was	no	science	for	how	skin	hung	off	of	muscle	,	right	?
so	,	in	the	video	world	,	we	've	been	able	to	invent	,	in	our	lifetimes	,	natural	behavior	.
and	this	is	kind	of	another	example	of	putting	a	science	behind	natural	behavior	.
and	then	you	heard	the	original	.
ultimately	,	i	started	with	the	experience	.
and	the	experience	is	:	i	want	to	be	in	the	room	and	hear	the	musicians	.
lots	of	you	can	afford	to	buy	one	of	these	.
but	,	if	not	,	there	is	now	high	-	definition	surround	sound	.
and	i	got	to	tell	you	,	if	you	have	n't	heard	high	-	definition	surround	,	go	down	to	your	audio	dealer	,	your	audiophile	dealer	.
it	's	so	involving	compared	to	regular	stereo	.
but	if	you	do	n't	have	that	,	maybe	you	can	listen	on	your	headphones	.
and	so	on	the	same	disk	we	have	five	recordings	--	sony	has	five	recordings	.
and	you	could	listen	in	headphones	with	this	thing	called	binaural	recording	.
and	it	's	a	dummy	head	that	sits	in	front	of	the	instrument	,	and	it	's	got	microphones	where	the	ears	are	.
and	when	you	put	on	headphones	,	and	you	listen	to	this	,	you	're	inside	of	glenn	gould	's	body	.
and	it	is	a	chuckle	until	,	you	know	,	the	musicians	,	who	are	musicians	who	play	the	piano	,	listen	to	this	,	say	,	``	i	ca	n't	believe	it	!	it	's	just	what	it	's	like	to	play	the	piano	.	``
except	now	you	're	inside	glenn	gould	's	body	playing	the	piano	,	and	it	feels	like	your	fingers	are	making	the	decisions	and	moving	through	the	whole	process	.
it	's	a	game	changer	.
here	's	now	something	we	know	in	spectacular	quality	.
the	whole	process	is	very	sensitive	to	temperature	and	humidity	.
what	you	heard	today	was	not	perfect	.
it	's	an	amalgam	of	wood	,	and	cast	iron	,	and	felt	,	and	steel	strings	,	and	all	these	,	and	they	're	all	amazingly	sensitive	to	temperature	and	humidity	.
so	when	you	go	into	the	recording	session	,	you	get	to	stop	after	every	piece	and	rebuild	the	piano	if	you	need	to	.
there	's	the	whole	action	there	,	sitting	,	kind	of	,	on	the	side	,	and	the	dummy	head	and	our	recording	engineers	standing	around	while	we	rebuild	the	piano	.
without	putting	dates	next	to	these	things	,	step	-	by	-	step	music	will	be	turned	into	data	,	like	every	field	that	's	occurred	in	the	past	35	or	40	years	.
audio	has	come	very	late	to	this	game	--	i	'm	not	talking	about	digitizing	,	and	bits	,	and	re	-	mastering	.
i	'm	talking	about	turn	it	into	the	data	that	it	was	made	from	,	which	is	how	it	was	performed	.
and	audio	came	very	late	because	our	ears	are	so	hard	to	fool	--	they	're	high	-	resolution	,	and	they	're	wired	straight	to	our	emotions	,	and	you	ca	n't	trick	them	very	easily	.
your	eyes	are	pretty	happy	with	some	color	and	movement	,	you	know	.
all	right	,	there	's	this	episode	of	``	star	trek	.	``
i	get	it	--	it	was	all	just	laid	in	for	me	yesterday	there	.
the	episode	of	``	star	trek	``	for	me	was	james	daly	played	methuselah	--	remember	this	one	?
and	at	some	point	he	's	dancing	with	his	--	and	i	wo	n't	ruin	the	episode	for	you	,	from	1967	.
right	,	do	you	know	where	i	'm	going	?
and	nimoy	,	i	'm	sorry	,	spock	sits	down	at	the	piano	,	and	he	starts	playing	this	brahms	waltz	,	and	they	all	dance	to	it	.
and	then	spock	turns	round	,	he	goes	,	``	james	,	i	know	all	of	the	brahms	waltzes	,	and	i	do	n't	believe	this	is	one	of	them	in	the	category	.	``
that	's	where	i	'm	at	.
i	want	to	hear	the	waltzes	brahms	did	n't	write	.
i	want	to	hear	the	pieces	that	horowitz	did	n't	play	.
but	i	believe	we	're	on	a	path	now	,	when	we	get	to	data	,	that	we	can	distill	styles	,	and	templates	,	and	formulas	,	and	all	these	kinds	of	things	,	again	,	that	you	've	seen	happen	in	the	computer	graphics	world	.
it	's	now	coming	in	this	world	.
the	transition	will	be	this	one	.
it	says	right	now	,	we	think	music	is	notes	and	how	they	're	played	.
and	i	believe	this	is	coming	.
because	what	you	've	just	heard	was	a	computer	playing	data	--	no	glenn	gould	in	the	room	.
but	yet	,	it	was	human	.
and	i	believe	you	'll	get	to	the	next	step	,	the	real	dream	of	listeners	.
every	time	you	listen	to	a	recording	today	,	every	time	you	take	out	your	ipod	and	whatever	,	every	time	you	listen	to	it	,	it	's	the	same	thing	--	it	's	frozen	.
would	n't	it	be	cool	if	every	time	you	listened	,	it	could	be	different	?
this	morning	,	you	're	sadder	,	you	want	to	hear	your	song	,	the	same	song	,	played	sadder	than	you	did	yesterday	.
you	want	to	hear	it	played	by	different	musicians	.
you	want	to	hear	it	in	different	rooms	and	whatever	.
we	've	seen	all	these	``	star	treks	,	``	and	they	're	all	holodeck	episodes	as	well	.
every	time	i	listen	to	that	,	i	get	goose	bumps	.
it	's	so	amazing	,	it	's	so	exciting	.
every	time	i	listen	to	that	recording	it	's	like	,	``	oh	my	god	,	i	ca	n't	believe	i	'm	in	the	same	room	.	i	ca	n't	believe	this	is	happening	.	``
it	's	a	way	better	experience	than	whatever	you	're	used	to	listening	to	,	in	whatever	form	.
and	lastly	,	i	will	wrap	up	with	one	minute	of	art	tatum	.
so	i	've	really	overshot	my	budget	here	.
we	made	a	new	recording	of	him	playing	in	the	shrine	auditorium	in	september	.
it	was	a	concert	he	recorded	in	the	shrine	auditorium	in	1949	.
and	i	've	got	to	tell	you	,	we	have	this	lab	where	we	build	and	measure	everything	,	back	in	raleigh	,	north	carolina	,	and	we	flew	out	to	los	angeles	.
and	as	the	president	of	the	company	,	i	did	n't	feel	real	comfortable	about	where	we	were	.
that	's	a	real	uncomfortable	feeling	,	when	all	the	equipment	's	come	out	and	a	whole	sony	team	,	and	people	are	going	to	be	sitting	there	in	the	audience	.
and	we	put	the	piano	on	the	sweet	spot	of	the	stage	in	the	shrine	,	which	has	not	changed	since	1949	,	still	seats	6,000	people	.
and	on	the	sweet	spot	on	the	stage	,	tatum	starts	playing	...
and	every	note	,	every	beat	,	every	slur	,	every	accent	,	every	pedal	was	perfect	,	because	he	played	it	for	that	room	on	that	day	.
and	we	captured	all	that	data	all	over	again	.
and	i	want	you	to	hear	that	right	now	.
and	fortunately	,	it	's	right	in	here	.
this	is	an	encore	he	used	to	do	.
it	's	one	minute	long	.
it	's	an	irish	jig	,	and	i	want	you	to	hear	his	humor	.
and	that	's	just	what	the	live	audience	did	.
so	thank	you	very	much	,	michael	,	thank	you	for	the	opportunity	.
