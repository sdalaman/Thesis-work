i	would	like	to	tell	you	about	a	project	which	i	started	about	16	years	ago	,	and	it	's	about	making	new	forms	of	life	.
and	these	are	made	of	this	kind	of	tube	--	electricity	tube	,	we	call	it	in	holland	.
and	we	can	start	a	film	about	that	,	and	we	can	see	a	little	bit	backwards	in	time	.
narrator	:	eventually	,	these	beasts	are	going	to	live	in	herds	on	the	beaches	.
theo	jansen	is	working	hard	on	this	evolution	.
theo	jansen	:	i	want	to	put	these	forms	of	life	on	the	beaches	.
and	they	should	survive	over	there	,	on	their	own	,	in	the	future	.
learning	to	live	on	their	own	--	and	it	'll	take	couple	of	more	years	to	let	them	walk	on	their	own	.
narrator	:	the	mechanical	beasts	will	not	get	their	energy	from	food	,	but	from	the	wind	.
the	wind	will	move	feathers	on	their	back	,	which	will	drive	their	feet	.
the	beast	walks	sideways	on	the	wet	sand	of	the	beach	,	with	its	nose	pointed	into	the	wind	.
as	soon	as	it	walks	into	either	the	rolling	surf	or	the	dry	sand	,	it	stops	,	and	walks	in	the	opposite	direction	.
evolution	has	generated	many	species	.
this	is	the	animaris	currens	ventosa	.
tj	:	this	is	a	herd	,	and	it	is	built	according	to	genetical	codes	.
and	it	is	a	sort	of	race	,	and	each	and	every	animal	is	different	,	and	the	winning	codes	will	multiply	.
this	is	the	wave	,	going	from	left	to	right	.	you	can	see	this	one	.
and	now	it	goes	from	--	yes	,	now	it	goes	from	left	to	right	.
this	is	a	new	generation	,	a	new	family	,	which	is	able	to	store	the	winds	.
so	,	the	wings	pump	up	air	in	lemonade	bottles	,	which	are	on	top	of	that	.
and	they	can	use	that	energy	in	case	the	wind	falls	away	,	and	the	tide	is	coming	up	,	and	there	is	still	a	little	bit	of	energy	to	reach	the	dunes	and	save	their	lives	,	because	they	are	drowned	very	easily	.
i	could	show	you	this	animal	.
thank	you	.
so	,	the	proportion	of	the	tubes	in	this	animal	is	very	important	for	the	walking	.
there	are	11	numbers	,	which	i	call	the	11	holy	numbers	.
these	are	the	distances	of	the	tubes	which	make	it	walk	that	way	.
in	fact	,	it	's	a	new	invention	of	the	wheel	.
it	works	the	same	as	a	wheel	.
the	axis	of	a	wheel	is	staying	on	the	same	level	,	and	this	hip	is	staying	on	the	same	level	as	well	.
in	fact	,	this	is	better	than	a	wheel	,	because	when	you	try	to	drive	with	your	bicycle	on	the	beach	,	you	will	notice	it	's	very	hard	to	do	.
and	the	feet	just	step	over	the	sand	,	and	the	wheel	has	to	touch	every	piece	of	the	ground	in	between	.
so	,	5,000	years	after	the	invention	of	the	wheel	,	we	have	a	new	wheel	.	and	i	will	show	you	,	in	the	next	video	--	can	you	start	it	,	please	?	--	that	very	heavy	loads	can	be	moved	.
there	's	a	guy	pushing	there	,	behind	,	but	can	also	walk	on	the	wind	very	well	.
it	's	3.2	tons	.
and	this	is	working	on	the	stored	winds	in	the	bottles	.
it	has	a	feeler	,	where	it	can	feel	obstacles	and	turn	around	.
and	that	stuff	,	you	see	,	is	going	to	it	the	other	way	.
can	i	have	the	feeler	here	?
ok	.	good	.
so	,	they	have	to	survive	all	the	dangers	of	the	beach	,	and	one	of	the	big	dangers	is	the	sea	.	this	is	the	sea	.
and	it	must	feel	the	water	of	the	sea	.
and	this	is	the	water	feeler	.
and	what	's	very	important	is	this	tube	.	it	sucks	in	air	normally	,	but	when	it	swallows	water	,	it	feels	the	resistance	of	it	.
so	imagine	that	the	animal	is	walking	towards	the	sea	.
as	soon	as	it	touches	the	water	,	you	should	hear	a	sort	of	sound	of	running	air	.
yes	!	so	if	it	does	n't	feel	,	it	will	be	drowned	,	ok	?
here	,	we	have	the	brain	of	the	animal	.
in	fact	,	it	is	a	step	counter	,	and	it	counts	the	steps	.
it	's	a	binary	step	counter	.
so	as	soon	it	has	been	to	the	sea	,	it	changes	the	pattern	of	zeroes	and	ones	here	,	and	it	knows	always	where	it	is	on	the	beach	.	so	it	's	very	simple	brain	.
it	says	,	well	,	there	's	the	sea	,	there	are	dunes	,	and	i	'm	here	.
so	it	's	a	sort	of	imagination	of	the	simple	world	of	the	beach	animal	.
thank	you	.
one	of	the	biggest	enemies	are	the	storms	.
this	is	a	part	of	the	nose	of	the	animaris	percipiere	,	and	when	the	nose	is	fixed	--	of	the	animal	--	the	whole	animal	is	fixed	.
so	when	the	storm	is	coming	up	,	it	drives	a	pin	into	the	ground	.
and	the	nose	is	fixed	,	the	whole	animal	is	fixed	.
the	wind	may	turn	,	but	the	animal	will	turn	always	its	nose	into	the	wind	.
now	,	another	couple	of	years	,	and	these	animals	will	survive	on	their	own	.
i	still	have	to	help	them	a	lot	.
thank	you	very	much	,	ladies	and	gentlemen	.
