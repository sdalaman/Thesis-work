what	i	want	to	tell	you	about	today	is	how	i	see	robots	invading	our	lives	at	multiple	levels	,	over	multiple	timescales	.
and	when	i	look	out	in	the	future	,	i	ca	n't	imagine	a	world	,	500	years	from	now	,	where	we	do	n't	have	robots	everywhere	.
assuming	--	despite	all	the	dire	predictions	from	many	people	about	our	future	--	assuming	we	're	still	around	,	i	ca	n't	imagine	the	world	not	being	populated	with	robots	.
and	then	the	question	is	,	well	,	if	they	're	going	to	be	here	in	500	years	,	are	they	going	to	be	everywhere	sooner	than	that	?
are	they	going	to	be	around	in	50	years	?
yeah	,	i	think	that	's	pretty	likely	--	there	's	going	to	be	lots	of	robots	everywhere	.
and	in	fact	i	think	that	's	going	to	be	a	lot	sooner	than	that	.
i	think	we	're	sort	of	on	the	cusp	of	robots	becoming	common	,	and	i	think	we	're	sort	of	around	1978	or	1980	in	personal	computer	years	,	where	the	first	few	robots	are	starting	to	appear	.
computers	sort	of	came	around	through	games	and	toys	.
and	you	know	,	the	first	computer	most	people	had	in	the	house	may	have	been	a	computer	to	play	pong	,	a	little	microprocessor	embedded	,	and	then	other	games	that	came	after	that	.
and	we	're	starting	to	see	that	same	sort	of	thing	with	robots	:	lego	mindstorms	,	furbies	--	who	here	--	did	anyone	here	have	a	furby	?
yeah	,	there	's	38	million	of	them	sold	worldwide	.
they	are	pretty	common	.	and	they	're	a	little	tiny	robot	,	a	simple	robot	with	some	sensors	,	a	little	bit	of	processing	actuation	.
on	the	right	there	is	another	robot	doll	,	who	you	could	get	a	couple	of	years	ago	.
and	just	as	in	the	early	days	,	when	there	was	a	lot	of	sort	of	amateur	interaction	over	computers	,	you	can	now	get	various	hacking	kits	,	how	-	to	-	hack	books	.
and	on	the	left	there	is	a	platform	from	evolution	robotics	,	where	you	put	a	pc	on	,	and	you	program	this	thing	with	a	gui	to	wander	around	your	house	and	do	various	stuff	.
and	then	there	's	a	higher	price	point	sort	of	robot	toys	--	the	sony	aibo	.	and	on	the	right	there	,	is	one	that	the	nec	developed	,	the	papero	,	which	i	do	n't	think	they	're	going	to	release	.
but	nevertheless	,	those	sorts	of	things	are	out	there	.
and	we	've	seen	,	over	the	last	two	or	three	years	,	lawn	-	mowing	robots	,	husqvarna	on	the	bottom	,	friendly	robotics	on	top	there	,	an	israeli	company	.
and	then	in	the	last	12	months	or	so	we	've	started	to	see	a	bunch	of	home	-	cleaning	robots	appear	.
the	top	left	one	is	a	very	nice	home	-	cleaning	robot	from	a	company	called	dyson	,	in	the	u.k.	except	it	was	so	expensive	--	3,500	dollars	--	they	did	n't	release	it	.
but	at	the	bottom	left	,	you	see	electrolux	,	which	is	on	sale	.
another	one	from	karcher	.
at	the	bottom	right	is	one	that	i	built	in	my	lab	about	10	years	ago	,	and	we	finally	turned	that	into	a	product	.
and	let	me	just	show	you	that	.
we	're	going	to	give	this	away	i	think	,	chris	said	,	after	the	talk	.
this	is	a	robot	that	you	can	go	out	and	buy	,	and	that	will	clean	up	your	floor	.
and	it	starts	off	sort	of	just	going	around	in	ever	-	increasing	circles	.
if	it	hits	something	--	you	people	see	that	?
now	it	's	doing	wall	-	following	,	it	's	following	around	my	feet	to	clean	up	around	me	.	let	's	see	,	let	's	--	oh	,	who	stole	my	rice	krispies	?	they	stole	my	rice	krispies	!
do	n't	worry	,	relax	,	no	,	relax	,	it	's	a	robot	,	it	's	smart	!
see	,	the	three	-	year	-	old	kids	,	they	do	n't	worry	about	it	.
it	's	grown	-	ups	that	get	really	upset	.
we	'll	just	put	some	crap	here	.
okay	.
i	do	n't	know	if	you	see	--	so	,	i	put	a	bunch	of	rice	krispies	there	,	i	put	some	pennies	,	let	's	just	shoot	it	at	that	,	see	if	it	cleans	up	.
yeah	,	ok	.	so	--	we	'll	leave	that	for	later	.
part	of	the	trick	was	building	a	better	cleaning	mechanism	,	actually	;	the	intelligence	on	board	was	fairly	simple	.
and	that	's	true	with	a	lot	of	robots	.
we	've	all	,	i	think	,	become	,	sort	of	computational	chauvinists	,	and	think	that	computation	is	everything	,	but	the	mechanics	still	matter	.
here	's	another	robot	,	the	packbot	,	that	we	've	been	building	for	a	bunch	of	years	.
it	's	a	military	surveillance	robot	,	to	go	in	ahead	of	troops	--	looking	at	caves	,	for	instance	.
but	we	had	to	make	it	fairly	robust	,	much	more	robust	than	the	robots	we	build	in	our	labs	.
on	board	that	robot	is	a	pc	running	linux	.
it	can	withstand	a	400g	shock	.	the	robot	has	local	intelligence	:	it	can	flip	itself	over	,	can	get	itself	into	communication	range	,	can	go	upstairs	by	itself	,	et	cetera	.
okay	,	so	it	's	doing	local	navigation	there	.
a	soldier	gives	it	a	command	to	go	upstairs	,	and	it	does	.
that	was	not	a	controlled	descent	.
now	it	's	going	to	head	off	.
and	the	big	breakthrough	for	these	robots	,	really	,	was	september	11th	.
we	had	the	robots	down	at	the	world	trade	center	late	that	evening	.
could	n't	do	a	lot	in	the	main	rubble	pile	,	things	were	just	too	--	there	was	nothing	left	to	do	.
but	we	did	go	into	all	the	surrounding	buildings	that	had	been	evacuated	,	and	searched	for	possible	survivors	in	the	buildings	that	were	too	dangerous	to	go	into	.
let	's	run	this	video	.
reporter	:	...	battlefield	companions	are	helping	to	reduce	the	combat	risks	.
nick	robertson	has	that	story	.
rodney	brooks	:	can	we	have	another	one	of	these	?
okay	,	good	.
so	,	this	is	a	corporal	who	had	seen	a	robot	two	weeks	previously	.
he	's	sending	robots	into	caves	,	looking	at	what	's	going	on	.
the	robot	's	being	totally	autonomous	.
the	worst	thing	that	's	happened	in	the	cave	so	far	was	one	of	the	robots	fell	down	ten	meters	.
so	one	year	ago	,	the	us	military	did	n't	have	these	robots	.
now	they	're	on	active	duty	in	afghanistan	every	day	.
and	that	's	one	of	the	reasons	they	say	a	robot	invasion	is	happening	.
there	's	a	sea	change	happening	in	how	--	where	technology	's	going	.
thanks	.
and	over	the	next	couple	of	months	,	we	're	going	to	be	sending	robots	in	production	down	producing	oil	wells	to	get	that	last	few	years	of	oil	out	of	the	ground	.
very	hostile	environments	,	150Ëš	c	,	10,000	psi	.
autonomous	robots	going	down	,	doing	this	sort	of	work	.
but	robots	like	this	,	they	're	a	little	hard	to	program	.
how	,	in	the	future	,	are	we	going	to	program	our	robots	and	make	them	easier	to	use	?
and	i	want	to	actually	use	a	robot	here	--	a	robot	named	chris	--	stand	up	.	yeah	.	okay	.
come	over	here	.	now	notice	,	he	thinks	robots	have	to	be	a	bit	stiff	.
he	sort	of	does	that	.	but	i	'm	going	to	--	chris	anderson	:	i	'm	just	british	.	rb	:	oh	.
i	'm	going	to	show	this	robot	a	task	.	it	's	a	very	complex	task	.
now	notice	,	he	nodded	there	,	he	was	giving	me	some	indication	he	was	understanding	the	flow	of	communication	.
and	if	i	'd	said	something	completely	bizarre	he	would	have	looked	askance	at	me	,	and	regulated	the	conversation	.
so	now	i	brought	this	up	in	front	of	him	.
i	'd	looked	at	his	eyes	,	and	i	saw	his	eyes	looked	at	this	bottle	top	.
and	i	'm	doing	this	task	here	,	and	he	's	checking	up	.
his	eyes	are	going	back	and	forth	up	to	me	,	to	see	what	i	'm	looking	at	--	so	we	've	got	shared	attention	.
and	so	i	do	this	task	,	and	he	looks	,	and	he	looks	to	me	to	see	what	's	happening	next	.	and	now	i	'll	give	him	the	bottle	,	and	we	'll	see	if	he	can	do	the	task	.	can	you	do	that	?
okay	.	he	's	pretty	good	.	yeah	.	good	,	good	,	good	.
i	did	n't	show	you	how	to	do	that	.
now	see	if	you	can	put	it	back	together	.
and	he	thinks	a	robot	has	to	be	really	slow	.
good	robot	,	that	's	good	.
so	we	saw	a	bunch	of	things	there	.
we	saw	when	we	're	interacting	,	we	're	trying	to	show	someone	how	to	do	something	,	we	direct	their	visual	attention	.
the	other	thing	communicates	their	internal	state	to	us	,	whether	he	's	understanding	or	not	,	regulates	a	social	interaction	.
there	was	shared	attention	looking	at	the	same	sort	of	thing	,	and	recognizing	socially	communicated	reinforcement	at	the	end	.
and	we	've	been	trying	to	put	that	into	our	lab	robots	because	we	think	this	is	how	you	're	going	to	want	to	interact	with	robots	in	the	future	.
i	just	want	to	show	you	one	technical	diagram	here	.
the	most	important	thing	for	building	a	robot	that	you	can	interact	with	socially	is	its	visual	attention	system	.
because	what	it	pays	attention	to	is	what	it	's	seeing	and	interacting	with	,	and	what	you	're	understanding	what	it	's	doing	.
so	in	the	videos	i	'm	about	to	show	you	,	you	're	going	to	see	a	visual	attention	system	on	a	robot	which	has	--	it	looks	for	skin	tone	in	hsv	space	,	so	it	works	across	all	human	colorings	.
it	looks	for	highly	saturated	colors	,	from	toys	.
and	it	looks	for	things	that	move	around	.
and	it	weights	those	together	into	an	attention	window	,	and	it	looks	for	the	highest	-	scoring	place	--	the	stuff	where	the	most	interesting	stuff	is	happening	--	and	that	is	what	its	eyes	then	segue	to	.
and	it	looks	right	at	that	.
at	the	same	time	,	some	top	-	down	sort	of	stuff	:	might	decide	that	it	's	lonely	and	look	for	skin	tone	,	or	might	decide	that	it	's	bored	and	look	for	a	toy	to	play	with	.
and	so	these	weights	change	.
and	over	here	on	the	right	,	this	is	what	we	call	the	steven	spielberg	memorial	module	.
did	people	see	the	movie	``	ai	``	?
rb	:	yeah	,	it	was	really	bad	,	but	--	remember	,	especially	when	haley	joel	osment	,	the	little	robot	,	looked	at	the	blue	fairy	for	2,000	years	without	taking	his	eyes	off	it	?
well	,	this	gets	rid	of	that	,	because	this	is	a	habituation	gaussian	that	gets	negative	,	and	more	and	more	intense	as	it	looks	at	one	thing	.
and	it	gets	bored	,	so	it	will	then	look	away	at	something	else	.
so	,	once	you	've	got	that	--	and	here	's	a	robot	,	here	's	kismet	,	looking	around	for	a	toy	.	you	can	tell	what	it	's	looking	at	.
you	can	estimate	its	gaze	direction	from	those	eyeballs	covering	its	camera	,	and	you	can	tell	when	it	's	actually	seeing	the	toy	.
and	it	's	got	a	little	bit	of	an	emotional	response	here	.
but	it	's	still	going	to	pay	attention	if	something	more	significant	comes	into	its	field	of	view	--	such	as	cynthia	breazeal	,	the	builder	of	this	robot	,	from	the	right	.
it	sees	her	,	pays	attention	to	her	.
kismet	has	an	underlying	,	three	-	dimensional	emotional	space	,	a	vector	space	,	of	where	it	is	emotionally	.
and	at	different	places	in	that	space	,	it	expresses	--	can	we	have	the	volume	on	here	?
can	you	hear	that	now	,	out	there	?
kismet	:	do	you	really	think	so	?	do	you	really	think	so	?
do	you	really	think	so	?
rb	:	so	it	's	expressing	its	emotion	through	its	face	and	the	prosody	in	its	voice	.
and	when	i	was	dealing	with	my	robot	over	here	,	chris	,	the	robot	,	was	measuring	the	prosody	in	my	voice	,	and	so	we	have	the	robot	measure	prosody	for	four	basic	messages	that	mothers	give	their	children	pre	-	linguistically	.
here	we	've	got	naive	subjects	praising	the	robot	:	voice	:	nice	robot	.
you	're	such	a	cute	little	robot	.
rb	:	and	the	robot	's	reacting	appropriately	.
voice	:	...	very	good	,	kismet	.
voice	:	look	at	my	smile	.
rb	:	it	smiles	.	she	imitates	the	smile	.	this	happens	a	lot	.
these	are	naive	subjects	.
here	we	asked	them	to	get	the	robot	's	attention	and	indicate	when	they	have	the	robot	's	attention	.
voice	:	hey	,	kismet	,	ah	,	there	it	is	.
rb	:	so	she	realizes	she	has	the	robot	's	attention	.
voice	:	kismet	,	do	you	like	the	toy	?	oh	.
rb	:	now	,	here	they	're	asked	to	prohibit	the	robot	,	and	this	first	woman	really	pushes	the	robot	into	an	emotional	corner	.
voice	:	no	.	no	.	you	're	not	to	do	that	.	no	.
not	appropriate	.	no	.	no	.
rb	:	i	'm	going	to	leave	it	at	that	.
we	put	that	together	.	then	we	put	in	turn	taking	.
when	we	talk	to	someone	,	we	talk	.
then	we	sort	of	raise	our	eyebrows	,	move	our	eyes	,	give	the	other	person	the	idea	it	's	their	turn	to	talk	.
and	then	they	talk	,	and	then	we	pass	the	baton	back	and	forth	between	each	other	.
so	we	put	this	in	the	robot	.
we	got	a	bunch	of	naive	subjects	in	,	we	did	n't	tell	them	anything	about	the	robot	,	sat	them	down	in	front	of	the	robot	and	said	,	talk	to	the	robot	.
now	what	they	did	n't	know	was	,	the	robot	was	n't	understanding	a	word	they	said	,	and	that	the	robot	was	n't	speaking	english	.
it	was	just	saying	random	english	phonemes	.
and	i	want	you	to	watch	carefully	,	at	the	beginning	of	this	,	where	this	person	,	ritchie	,	who	happened	to	talk	to	the	robot	for	25	minutes	--	--	says	,	``	i	want	to	show	you	something	.
i	want	to	show	you	my	watch	.	``
and	he	brings	the	watch	center	,	into	the	robot	's	field	of	vision	,	points	to	it	,	gives	it	a	motion	cue	,	and	the	robot	looks	at	the	watch	quite	successfully	.
we	do	n't	know	whether	he	understood	or	not	that	the	robot	--	notice	the	turn	-	taking	.
ritchie	:	ok	,	i	want	to	show	you	something	.	ok	,	this	is	a	watch	that	my	girlfriend	gave	me	.
robot	:	oh	,	cool	.
ritchie	:	yeah	,	look	,	it	's	got	a	little	blue	light	in	it	too	.	i	almost	lost	it	this	week	.
rb	:	so	it	's	making	eye	contact	with	him	,	following	his	eyes	.
ritchie	:	can	you	do	the	same	thing	?	robot	:	yeah	,	sure	.
rb	:	and	they	successfully	have	that	sort	of	communication	.
and	here	's	another	aspect	of	the	sorts	of	things	that	chris	and	i	were	doing	.
this	is	another	robot	,	cog	.
they	first	make	eye	contact	,	and	then	,	when	christie	looks	over	at	this	toy	,	the	robot	estimates	her	gaze	direction	and	looks	at	the	same	thing	that	she	's	looking	at	.
so	we	're	going	to	see	more	and	more	of	this	sort	of	robot	over	the	next	few	years	in	labs	.
but	then	the	big	questions	,	two	big	questions	that	people	ask	me	are	:	if	we	make	these	robots	more	and	more	human	-	like	,	will	we	accept	them	,	will	we	--	will	they	need	rights	eventually	?
and	the	other	question	people	ask	me	is	,	will	they	want	to	take	over	?
and	on	the	first	--	you	know	,	this	has	been	a	very	hollywood	theme	with	lots	of	movies	.	you	probably	recognize	these	characters	here	--	where	in	each	of	these	cases	,	the	robots	want	more	respect	.
well	,	do	you	ever	need	to	give	robots	respect	?
they	're	just	machines	,	after	all	.
but	i	think	,	you	know	,	we	have	to	accept	that	we	are	just	machines	.
after	all	,	that	's	certainly	what	modern	molecular	biology	says	about	us	.
you	do	n't	see	a	description	of	how	,	you	know	,	molecule	a	,	you	know	,	comes	up	and	docks	with	this	other	molecule	.
and	it	's	moving	forward	,	you	know	,	propelled	by	various	charges	,	and	then	the	soul	steps	in	and	tweaks	those	molecules	so	that	they	connect	.
it	's	all	mechanistic	.	we	are	mechanism	.
if	we	are	machines	,	then	in	principle	at	least	,	we	should	be	able	to	build	machines	out	of	other	stuff	,	which	are	just	as	alive	as	we	are	.
but	i	think	for	us	to	admit	that	,	we	have	to	give	up	on	our	special	-	ness	,	in	a	certain	way	.
and	we	've	had	the	retreat	from	special	-	ness	under	the	barrage	of	science	and	technology	many	times	over	the	last	few	hundred	years	,	at	least	.
500	years	ago	we	had	to	give	up	the	idea	that	we	are	the	center	of	the	universe	when	the	earth	started	to	go	around	the	sun	;	150	years	ago	,	with	darwin	,	we	had	to	give	up	the	idea	we	were	different	from	animals	.
and	to	imagine	--	you	know	,	it	's	always	hard	for	us	.
recently	we	've	been	battered	with	the	idea	that	maybe	we	did	n't	even	have	our	own	creation	event	,	here	on	earth	,	which	people	did	n't	like	much	.	and	then	the	human	genome	said	,	maybe	we	only	have	35,000	genes	.	and	that	was	really	--	people	did	n't	like	that	,	we	've	got	more	genes	than	that	.
we	do	n't	like	to	give	up	our	special	-	ness	,	so	,	you	know	,	having	the	idea	that	robots	could	really	have	emotions	,	or	that	robots	could	be	living	creatures	--	i	think	is	going	to	be	hard	for	us	to	accept	.
but	we	're	going	to	come	to	accept	it	over	the	next	50	years	or	so	.
and	the	second	question	is	,	will	the	machines	want	to	take	over	?
and	here	the	standard	scenario	is	that	we	create	these	things	,	they	grow	,	we	nurture	them	,	they	learn	a	lot	from	us	,	and	then	they	start	to	decide	that	we	're	pretty	boring	,	slow	.
they	want	to	take	over	from	us	.
and	for	those	of	you	that	have	teenagers	,	you	know	what	that	's	like	.
but	hollywood	extends	it	to	the	robots	.
and	the	question	is	,	you	know	,	will	someone	accidentally	build	a	robot	that	takes	over	from	us	?
and	that	's	sort	of	like	this	lone	guy	in	the	backyard	,	you	know	--	``	i	accidentally	built	a	747.	``
i	do	n't	think	that	's	going	to	happen	.
and	i	do	n't	think	--	--	i	do	n't	think	we	're	going	to	deliberately	build	robots	that	we	're	uncomfortable	with	.
we	'll	--	you	know	,	they	're	not	going	to	have	a	super	bad	robot	.
before	that	has	to	come	to	be	a	mildly	bad	robot	,	and	before	that	a	not	so	bad	robot	.
and	we	're	just	not	going	to	let	it	go	that	way	.
so	,	i	think	i	'm	going	to	leave	it	at	that	:	the	robots	are	coming	,	we	do	n't	have	too	much	to	worry	about	,	it	's	going	to	be	a	lot	of	fun	,	and	i	hope	you	all	enjoy	the	journey	over	the	next	50	years	.
