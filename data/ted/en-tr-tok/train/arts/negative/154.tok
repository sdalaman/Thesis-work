welcome	to	africa	!	or	rather	,	i	should	say	,	welcome	home	.
because	this	is	where	it	all	really	began	,	is	n't	it	?
looking	at	fossils	dating	back	several	millions	of	years	--	it	all	points	to	evidence	that	life	for	the	human	species	as	we	know	it	began	right	here	.
we	are	on	an	amazing	journey	the	next	four	days	.
you	're	going	to	hear	stories	of	``	africa	:	the	next	chapter	.	``
fantastic	tales	,	anecdotes	from	speakers	.
but	i	want	to	turn	that	upside	down	for	a	moment	,	and	get	something	out	on	the	table	and	clear	the	air	so	to	say	.
what	's	the	worst	thing	you	've	ever	heard	about	africa	?
and	this	is	not	a	rhetorical	question	.
i	actually	want	answers	from	you	.
go	for	it	!	the	worst	.
famine	.
corruption	.
more	.
genocide	.
aids	.
slavery	.
that	's	enough	.
we	've	all	heard	these	things	.
but	this	is	about	africa	,	the	story	we	have	not	heard	.
the	stories	that	we	want	to	know	,	and	the	stories	that	do	exist	about	positive	tales	.
a	part	of	my	talk	is	going	to	be	about	investment	opportunities	that	exist	on	this	continent	,	to	separate	the	rhetoric	from	the	reality	,	the	fact	from	the	fiction	.
to	go	to	the	actual	data	and	statistics	that	exist	about	the	actual	things	that	are	happening	on	the	ground	that	make	africa	a	realistic	investment	opportunity	and	option	for	you	.
so	let	's	get	going	because	africa	,	to	some	degree	,	is	on	a	turnaround	.
a	turnaround	in	terms	of	how	it	manages	its	image	,	and	how	it	takes	control	of	its	own	destiny	.
and	turnarounds	are	part	and	parcel	of	what	i	have	focused	on	for	most	of	my	professional	career	.
and	it	all	started	almost	a	decade	ago	,	as	a	young	consultant	at	mckinsey	&	company	at	their	first	african	office	in	johannesburg	.
and	there	we	worked	with	leading	ceos	on	african	issues	,	and	african	companies	on	turnarounds	,	making	the	companies	not	just	the	best	in	africa	but	the	best	globally	.
but	i	really	formalized	this	focus	on	turnarounds	when	i	was	completing	my	mba	in	the	united	states	.
it	all	began	with	a	fantastic	phone	call	.
it	was	from	rosabeth	moss	kanter	,	harvard	business	school	guru	and	a	professor	of	mine	.
and	she	said	,	``	i	want	to	write	a	case	,	euvin	--	a	case	on	a	public	-	sector	leader	that	has	lessons	for	the	corporate	world	.	``
and	the	leader	that	came	to	mind	was	nelson	mandela	.
because	nelson	mandela	,	as	he	took	over	power	as	the	first	democratically	-	elected	president	of	south	africa	,	faced	a	situation	of	a	country	that	could	have	slid	into	the	abyss	of	chaos	.
but	he	started	the	country	on	a	path	of	a	positive	cycle	.
now	the	case	,	``	nelson	mandela	:	change	leader	,	``	became	part	of	the	research	base	for	a	chapter	in	rosabeth	's	new	book	called	``	confidence	.	``
and	``	confidence	``	became	a	new	york	times	bestseller	and	topped	business	week	's	hardcover	bestseller	list	.
and	why	i	tell	you	this	story	is	because	later	,	when	i	was	interviewed	on	sabc	africa	,	on	a	pan	-	african	broadcast	,	they	asked	,	``	what	is	your	key	lesson	,	or	the	key	thing	you	enjoy	the	most	?	``	--	because	it	was	a	huge	privilege	to	be	part	of	such	a	project	.
the	lesson	from	that	was	that	it	was	africa	--	an	african	story	--	that	was	used	to	share	news	with	the	rest	of	the	world	of	what	the	benchmark	can	be	for	corporate	turnarounds	.
africa	was	being	used	as	a	success	story	!
so	i	want	to	share	with	you	a	personal	story	about	a	turnaround	or	a	transformation	.
and	that	has	to	do	with	me	because	in	1994	,	i	packed	a	few	things	into	a	backpack	and	headed	off	for	a	year	of	travel	in	the	middle	of	my	university	career	.
you	should	have	seen	my	parents	'	reaction	!
but	very	soon	,	i	found	myself	from	the	southern	part	of	africa	,	in	south	africa	--	at	the	very	north	,	in	egypt	.
and	i	sought	out	the	most	remote	places	.
i	went	to	the	siwa	oasis	.	that	was	one	of	my	stops	.
and	the	siwa	oasis	is	famous	for	several	things	,	but	the	key	thing	is	that	it	was	the	place	that	alexander	the	great	went	to	when	he	wanted	to	find	out	what	his	destiny	had	in	store	for	him	.
and	legend	has	it	that	alexander	trekked	through	this	desert	.
half	his	battalion	was	wiped	out	in	the	sandstorm	.
and	myth	says	that	he	had	an	audience	with	the	oracle	,	and	it	foretold	his	destiny	of	greatness	.
this	was	300	bc	.
so	africa	had	long	been	seen	as	a	place	to	go	to	for	answers	.
now	,	the	thing	i	remember	about	siwa	was	the	magical	view	of	the	sky	at	night	.
with	no	natural	light	source	,	siva	is	one	of	these	amazing	places	that	when	you	look	up	you	see	a	perfect	tapestry	.
fast	forward	to	2002	.
i	'm	sitting	in	cambridge	,	massachusetts	at	the	healthcare	development	conference	.
and	i	see	the	same	picture	,	but	from	the	opposite	side	.
a	satellite	picture	looking	down	at	the	earth	.
and	it	was	that	picture	that	made	such	a	profound	impact	on	me	because	i	'll	never	forget	it	.	i	remember	the	very	moment	.
and	i	wanted	to	share	that	image	with	you	of	what	i	saw	at	that	point	.
the	first	thing	that	i	saw	was	north	america	at	night	--	glowing	,	in	all	its	glory	.	a	warm	feeling	.	light	.
and	then	i	saw	it	--	africa	.	quite	literally	the	``	dark	continent	.	``
and	while	africa	may	be	dark	,	the	thing	that	brought	the	message	home	to	me	was	that	this	is	the	challenge	we	are	facing	,	but	it	's	also	the	opportunity	.
because	whilst	africa	may	be	dark	--	other	than	the	few	specks	that	exist	north	and	in	the	south	and	other	areas	--	it	's	aglow	with	the	light	in	the	hearts	of	the	millions	of	people	that	are	there	.
entrepreneurs	,	dynamic	people	,	people	with	hope	.
it	was	george	kimble	,	the	geographer	,	who	said	that	,	``	the	only	thing	dark	about	africa	is	our	ignorance	of	it	.	``
so	let	's	start	shedding	light	on	this	amazing	eclectic	continent	that	has	so	much	to	offer	.
let	's	start	unpacking	it	.
africa	is	the	second	-	largest	continent	,	a	landmass	second	from	asia	.
it	also	is	the	second	most	populated	continent	,	with	900	million	people	.
in	fact	--	coming	back	to	the	land	mass	--	africa	is	so	big	that	you	could	fit	in	the	continental	united	states	,	china	,	and	the	entire	europe	into	africa	,	and	still	have	space	.
africa	is	home	to	over	1,000	languages	--	2,000	is	another	estimate	that	's	out	there	--	with	over	2,000	languages	and	dialects	.
but	you	could	say	,	``	invest	in	africa	in	over	1,000	languages	,	and	it	would	n't	make	a	difference	.	``
what	does	the	data	say	?
as	an	investment	banker	,	i	'm	in	the	cross	-	flow	of	information	and	the	changes	that	are	taking	place	in	capital	markets	.
so	i	want	to	share	with	you	some	of	these	bellwether	signals	,	or	signs	,	and	winds	of	change	that	are	sweeping	this	continent	.
so	let	's	start	on	that	.
and	let	's	start	at	the	high	level	,	on	the	macro	-	factors	.
inflation	,	in	general	,	is	coming	down	across	africa	--	that	's	the	first	sign	--	in	many	countries	reaching	double	-	digit	figures	.
so	let	's	start	looking	at	some	of	those	.
i	call	it	my	z.e.n	.	cluster	.
zambia	:	from	2004	to	2006	,	moves	from	the	18	percent	in	inflation	to	the	nine	percent	.
egypt	:	from	the	16	percent	to	about	8.4	percent	.
from	the	16	percent	to	the	eight	percent	.	single	digits	.
more	fascinating	,	you	have	other	countries	--	south	africa	,	mauritius	,	namibia	--	all	in	single	digits	.
but	that	's	just	part	of	the	story	.	you	have	a	similar	trend	with	currencies	--	currencies	going	through	an	extreme	time	of	stability	.
but	that	's	looking	at	the	big	picture	.
and	the	first	myth	to	dispel	is	that	africa	is	not	a	country	.
it	's	made	up	--	it	's	made	up	of	53	different	countries	.
so	the	very	definition	--	to	say	``	invest	in	africa	``	is	a	no	-	go	.
it	's	meaningless	.
each	country	has	a	unique	value	proposition	.
you	can	make	money	,	you	can	lose	money	in	africa	.
but	opportunities	,	boy	oh	boy	,	they	exist	.
and	this	is	what	today	is	about	--	it	's	about	discussing	those	very	opportunities	.
so	let	's	start	getting	into	the	countries	and	into	the	specific	material	and	data	.
i	was	recently	elected	,	as	emeka	mentioned	,	as	the	president	of	the	south	african	chamber	of	commerce	in	america	.
and	i	'm	very	proud	and	happy	to	be	in	that	role	because	it	is	a	fascinating	position	to	be	in	.
to	hear	this	dialogue	that	's	just	increasing	in	tenor	and	velocity	,	of	decisions	about	trade	and	companies	wanting	to	come	.
so	the	first	port	of	call	:	let	's	talk	a	little	bit	about	south	africa	.
but	not	the	south	africa	we	always	talk	about	--	the	gold	,	the	minerals	,	the	first	world	infrastructure	--	a	bit	about	the	other	side	of	it	.
for	example	,	south	africa	was	recently	voted	as	the	top	destination	for	the	top	1,000	uk	companies	for	offshore	call	-	centers	.
same	language	,	timeline	,	et	cetera	.	makes	sense	.
other	headlines	that	have	recently	reached	south	africa	were	bain	capital	and	kkr	,	the	big	boys	of	private	equity	.
headline	in	south	africa	:	``	they	have	landed	.	``	quite	ominous	.
but	what	were	they	there	for	?	to	acquire	assets	.
bing	capital	's	acquisition	of	edcon	,	a	large	retailer	,	is	testimony	to	the	confidence	they	are	starting	to	place	in	the	economy	.
because	it	is	actually	a	long	-	term	play	.
being	a	retailer	,	it	is	a	play	on	the	belief	that	this	middle	-	class	that	's	growing	will	continue	to	grow	,	that	the	boom	and	the	confidence	in	consumer	spending	will	continue	.
but	the	story	of	africa	,	and	my	focus	,	is	beyond	south	africa	because	there	's	so	much	happening	.
undoubtedly	,	nigeria	is	clearly	a	hot	spot	.
challenges	--	and	we	will	hear	a	lot	about	nigeria	in	these	four	days	.
but	looking	at	goldman	sachs	'	work	--	we	had	the	famous	bric	report	.
the	new	report	,	``	the	next	eleven	,	``	highlights	that	by	2020	nigeria	is	going	to	be	amongst	the	top	10	economies	in	the	world	.
it	's	an	investment	opportunity	.	think	about	that	.
is	anyone	--	our	banks	,	our	investors	--	seriously	thinking	about	going	to	nigeria	?
if	you	have	n't	,	why	not	?
what	's	going	on	in	nigeria	?	a	couple	of	things	.
i	want	to	talk	about	it	from	the	perspective	of	capital	markets	.
bellwether	signs	again	.
guarantee	trust	bank	recently	issued	the	first	euro	bond	out	of	africa	,	and	this	excludes	south	africa	.
but	the	first	eurobond	,	the	raising	of	international	capital	offshore	,	off	its	own	balance	sheet	,	without	any	sovereign	backing	--	that	is	an	indication	of	the	confidence	that	is	taking	place	in	that	economy	.
without	any	sovereign	backing	,	a	nigerian	company	raising	capital	offshore	.
it	's	just	a	sign	of	things	to	come	.
looking	at	the	oil	industry	,	africa	provides	18	percent	of	the	u.s.	's	oil	supply	,	with	the	middle	east	just	16	percent	.
it	's	an	important	strategic	partner	.
let	's	put	nigeria	in	perspective	.
2.2	to	2.4	million	barrels	of	oil	a	day	--	the	same	league	as	kuwait	,	the	same	league	as	venezuela	.
but	with	africa	,	let	's	start	being	careful	about	this	.
and	emeka	and	i	have	had	these	discussions	.
we	have	to	move	away	from	what	's	called	``	the	curse	of	the	commodities	.	``
because	it	's	not	about	oil	,	it	's	not	about	commodities	.
for	africa	to	truly	be	sustainable	,	we	have	to	move	beyond	to	other	industries	.
so	let	's	unpack	those	very	quickly	,	and	i	'm	going	to	move	through	these	very	,	very	,	very	fast	because	i	can	see	that	clock	counting	down	.
what	else	is	going	on	there	?	egypt	.
egypt	is	launching	a	first	large	industrial	zone	--	2.8	billion	investment	.
the	announcement	just	came	out	the	last	few	weeks	.
close	to	the	mediterranean	,	near	alexandria	--	textiles	,	petrochemicals	.
it	's	being	managed	by	a	singaporean	-	based	management	company	.
so	they	want	to	emerge	as	an	industrial	powerhouse	across	the	industries	--	away	from	oil	.
let	's	look	at	agriculture	.	let	's	look	at	forestry	.
what	's	going	on	there	?
in	tanzania	last	week	,	we	had	the	launch	of	the	east	african	organic	produce	standard	.
again	,	gathering	together	farmers	,	gathering	together	stakeholders	in	east	africa	to	get	standards	for	organic	produce	.	better	prices	.
it	ties	in	with	small	-	scale	farmers	in	terms	of	no	pesticides	,	no	fertilizers	.
again	,	opportunity	to	tackle	markets	to	get	that	higher	price	.
uganda	:	the	new	forest	company	,	replanting	and	redeveloping	their	forests	.	why	is	that	important	?
as	the	energy	needs	are	met	and	electricity	is	needed	[	we	will	need	]	poles	for	rolling	out	electricity	.
but	here	is	the	sweetener	in	the	deal	.
they	're	going	to	be	tapping	into	carbon	credits	.
let	's	go	back	to	nigeria	.
the	banking	sector	has	undergone	tremendous	transformation	,	from	over	80	banks	to	25	banks	.	strengthening	of	the	system	.
but	what	's	going	on	there	?	only	10	percent	of	the	country	is	banked	.
the	largest	population	in	africa	is	in	nigeria	.
135	million	-	plus	people	.	think	about	that	.
there	are	only	700	atms	in	the	country	.	opportunity	.
the	same	for	telecoms	across	the	country	.
now	let	's	look	at	the	continent	as	a	whole	.
people	look	at	the	roads	,	for	example	,	and	they	'd	say	,	``	angola	:	90	percent	of	roads	are	untarred	.	ah	,	problem	!	``
it	's	more	expensive	to	transport	goods	.	prices	of	goods	go	up	,	inflation	is	affected	.
nigeria	:	70	percent	of	roads	are	untarred	.	zambia	:	80	percent	.
in	general	,	more	than	50	percent	of	roads	are	untarred	.
this	is	an	opportunity	!	energy	needs	--	it	's	an	opportunity	.
so	what	are	the	signs	that	things	are	fundamentally	changing	?
let	's	look	at	the	stock	markets	in	africa	.
if	i	had	to	ask	you	,	``	in	2005	what	was	the	best	performing	stock	market	or	stock	exchange	in	the	world	?	``	would	egypt	come	to	mind	?
in	2005	,	the	egyptian	stock	exchange	returned	over	145	percent	.
what	's	going	on	in	some	of	the	other	countries	?
let	's	look	at	some	2006	numbers	.	kenya	:	over	60	percent	.	nigeria	:	over	40	percent	.
south	africa	:	in	the	20	percents	.	high	ones	.
these	are	the	trends	that	are	taking	place	.
but	in	any	investment	decision	,	the	key	question	is	,	``	what	is	my	alternative	investment	?	``
because	in	africa	today	,	we	are	competing	globally	for	capital	.
and	global	capital	is	agnostic	--	it	has	no	loyalties	.
there	's	an	overhang	of	capital	in	the	u.s.	,	and	the	key	is	yield	pickup	.
what	africa	is	providing	is	a	diversification	play	,	and	also	opportunities	for	yield	pickup	for	the	investor	that	's	aware	of	what	he	or	she	is	doing	.
now	,	when	looking	at	africa	vis	-	a	-	vis	other	things	,	and	countries	in	africa	vis	-	a	-	vis	other	things	,	comparisons	become	important	.
10	years	ago	there	,	were	very	few	countries	that	received	sovereign	ratings	from	the	standard	&	poors	,	moody	's	and	fitch	's	.
today	,	16	african	countries	and	growing	have	sovereign	country	ratings	.	what	does	this	mean	?
take	nigeria	again	:	double	b	-	minus	--	in	the	league	of	ukraine	and	turkey	.	immediately	we	have	a	comparison	.
the	backbone	of	making	investment	decisions	for	global	holders	of	capital	.
some	other	figures	.	south	africa	:	triple	b	-	plus	.	botswana	:	a	-	plus	.
bakino	faso	:	b	-	minus	.	and	so	on	.
in	fact	,	one	of	the	big	agencies	is	setting	up	an	office	in	africa	.
why	are	they	doing	that	?	because	they	expect	investment	to	follow	.
so	one	of	the	big	bellwethers	,	and	one	of	my	final	points	i	want	to	mention	,	is	the	interesting	thing	i	read	is	that	cnbc	has	launched	their	first	african	channel	.	why	is	cnbc	doing	this	?
it	's	the	24	-	hour	rolling	african	news	channel	.
they	're	doing	it	because	they	are	expecting	things	to	happen	.
me	and	you	,	the	investments	we	are	going	to	be	making	,	the	investments	the	world	is	going	to	be	making	--	that	's	the	24	-	hour	news	channel	dedicated	to	africa	.
so	that	's	the	change	that	's	coming	down	the	pipeline	.
so	in	conclusion	,	i	want	to	turn	back	to	that	very	slide	that	made	such	a	deep	impact	on	me	all	those	years	ago	.
this	time	[	i	'll	]	give	you	the	entire	picture	that	i	saw	in	2002	,	and	ask	you	that	when	you	think	about	what	your	role	can	be	in	africa	,	think	about	your	journey	in	terms	of	bringing	light	to	this	continent	.
because	there	are	amazing	opportunities	available	.
and	think	about	the	concept	of	transformation	in	the	back	of	your	mind	because	things	can	be	turned	around	rather	quickly	.
in	1899	,	joseph	conrad	released	``	the	heart	of	darkness	,	``	a	tale	of	grim	horror	along	the	congo	river	.
if	one	looks	carefully	,	on	the	congo	river	is	one	of	those	bright	lights	.	and	that	's	the	very	congo	river	generating	light	--	the	old	heart	of	darkness	now	generating	light	with	hydro	-	electric	power	.
that	is	a	transformation	in	power	of	ideas	.
so	the	next	step	,	over	the	next	four	days	,	is	us	exploring	more	of	these	ideas	.
and	perchance	,	if	you	can	always	keep	this	picture	in	your	mind	,	that	when	we	convene	maybe	in	the	distant	future	,	in	2020	,	that	picture	will	look	very	different	.
thank	you	.
