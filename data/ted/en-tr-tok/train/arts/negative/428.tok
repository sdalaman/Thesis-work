sixty	-	five	million	years	ago	,	a	very	important	and	catastrophic	event	changed	the	course	of	life	on	land	.
and	although	we	know	that	the	land	animals	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	are	just	the	scum	of	the	earth	on	the	land	--	the	little	bits	of	land	floating	around	--	but	they	are	important	to	us	because	they	're	sort	of	in	our	scale	of	experience	from	millimeters	to	meters	.
and	these	animals	disappeared	,	and	a	separate	life	,	mammals	,	radiated	out	to	take	their	place	.	and	so	,	we	know	this	in	extraordinary	detail	.	and	so	this	is	a	core	from	near	bermuda	.	we	know	that	the	tsunamis	,	the	earthquakes	,	and	the	things	that	we	've	experienced	in	the	entire	record	of	humankind	history	ca	n't	really	quite	get	around	the	kind	of	disaster	that	this	represented	for	the	earth	.
so	even	before	that	impact	was	known	,	even	before	scientists	in	general	came	to	an	agreement	over	the	theory	of	evolution	,	scientists	and	natural	historians	of	all	kinds	of	stripes	actually	had	divided	earth	's	life	's	history	into	these	two	episodes	:	mesozoic	,	the	middle	life	,	and	the	cenozoic	,	the	recent	life	.
and	as	it	turns	out	,	it	actually	corresponds	really	nicely	with	geologic	history	.
so	we	have	a	mesozoic	period	,	an	age	of	fragmentation	,	and	a	cenozoic	period	,	an	age	of	reconnection	--	south	america	to	north	america	,	india	to	asia	.
and	so	my	work	,	really	,	is	trying	to	understand	the	character	of	that	mesozoic	radiation	compared	to	the	cenozoic	radiation	to	see	what	mysteries	we	can	understand	from	dinosaurs	and	from	other	animals	about	what	life	on	drifting	continents	really	can	tell	us	about	evolution	.
the	work	immediately	begs	the	question	,	``	why	did	n't	they	go	into	the	waters	?	``
i	mean	,	certainly	mammals	did	.	this	is	one	example	.
you	can	go	outside	--	see	many	other	examples	.
within	five	,	10	million	years	of	the	bolide	impact	we	had	a	whole	variety	of	animals	going	into	the	water	.	why	did	n't	they	do	that	?
why	did	n't	they	hang	around	in	trees	at	good	size	,	and	why	did	n't	they	burrow	?
why	did	n't	they	do	all	these	things	,	and	if	they	did	n't	do	all	these	things	,	what	kinds	of	animals	were	in	those	spaces	?
and	if	there	were	no	animals	in	those	spaces	,	what	does	that	tell	us	about	,	you	know	,	how	evolution	works	on	land	?
really	interesting	questions	.	i	think	a	lot	of	it	has	to	do	with	body	size	.
in	fact	,	i	think	that	most	of	it	has	to	do	with	body	size	--	the	size	you	are	when	you	inherit	a	vacant	ecospace	from	whatever	natural	disaster	.
looking	at	dinosaur	evolution	and	studying	it	,	digging	it	up	for	many	years	,	i	end	up	looking	at	the	mammal	radiation	,	and	it	seems	as	though	everything	is	quick	time	,	just	like	technology	,	advancing	by	an	order	of	magnitude	.
dinosaur	evolution	proceeded	at	a	stately	pace	,	an	order	of	magnitude	slower	on	any	way	you	want	to	measure	it	.
you	want	to	measure	it	by	diversity	?
you	want	to	measure	it	by	the	time	it	took	to	reach	maximum	body	size	?
yes	,	they	do	have	larger	body	size	,	but	many	of	them	are	smaller	,	but	we	're	interested	in	the	time	it	took	them	to	achieve	that	.
fifty	million	years	to	achieve	this	maximum	body	size	.
and	that	is	10	times	longer	than	it	took	the	mammals	to	achieve	maximum	body	size	and	invade	all	those	habitats	.
so	there	's	lessons	to	learn	,	and	there	's	lessons	to	learn	from	the	exception	,	the	exception	that	we	know	very	well	today	from	the	discoveries	we	've	made	,	and	many	other	scholars	have	made	around	the	world	.
this	slide	was	shown	before	.	this	is	the	famous	jurassic	bird	archaeopteryx	.
we	now	know	this	transition	is	the	one	time	that	dinosaurs	actually	went	below	that	body	size	--	we	're	going	to	see	where	they	began	in	a	minute	--	and	it	is	the	one	time	that	they	rapidly	invaded	all	the	habitats	i	just	told	you	that	dinosaurs	were	n't	in	.
they	became	marine	.	we	now	know	them	today	from	the	ice	caps	.
there	's	burrowing	birds	.
they	inhabit	the	trees	at	all	body	sizes	,	and	,	of	course	,	they	inhabit	the	land	.
so	we	were	the	first	to	actually	name	a	bird	from	the	famous	series	that	later	exploded	onto	the	pages	of	science	and	nature	.
we	called	this	bird	sinornis	.	it	's	a	little	bit	more	advanced	than	archaeopteryx	,	and	if	you	go	to	different	layers	,	you	find	things	that	are	less	advanced	than	archaeopteryx	,	and	every	grade	in	between	,	so	that	if	you	find	something	today	,	we	're	usually	splitting	hairs	--	or	,	more	appropriately	,	feathers	--	as	to	decide	whether	it	's	actually	a	non	-	avian	or	an	avian	.
it	is	the	greatest	transition	that	we	have	,	actually	,	on	land	from	one	habitat	to	another	,	bar	none	,	to	understand	how	a	bony	,	fairly	heavy	,	kilogram	or	a	couple	-	of	-	kilogram	animal	could	make	such	a	transition	.
it	is	really	our	greatest	--	one	of	our	greatest	--	evolutionary	sequences	.
now	,	my	work	began	at	the	beginning	.
i	thought	if	i	'm	going	to	understand	dinosaur	evolution	,	i	'd	have	to	go	back	to	those	beds	where	they	had	picked	up	fragments	,	go	back	to	a	time	and	a	place	where	the	earliest	dinosaurs	existed	.
i	'd	like	to	call	for	this	little	video	clip	to	give	you	some	idea	of	,	sort	of	,	what	we	face	.	normally	,	we	get	asked	a	lot	of	questions	:	``	well	,	how	do	you	find	fossils	in	areas	that	look	like	this	?	``
if	we	could	roll	that	first	video	clip	.
this	is	sort	of	a	nice	helicopter	ride	through	those	early	beds	,	and	they	're	located	in	northeastern	argentina	.
and	we	're	coming	over	a	cliff	,	and	at	the	top	of	that	cliff	,	dinosaurs	had	basically	taken	over	.
at	the	bottom	of	the	cliff	,	we	find	that	they	're	rare	as	hens	'	teeth	.
that	's	where	dinosaur	origins	is	to	be	found	:	at	the	bottom	of	the	cliff	.
you	go	into	an	area	like	this	,	you	get	a	geologic	map	,	you	get	a	topographic	map	,	and	the	best	,	most	-	inspired	team	you	can	bring	to	the	area	.
and	the	rest	is	up	to	you	.	you	've	got	to	find	fossils	.
you	've	got	to	dig	a	hole	that	's	usually	quite	a	bit	bigger	than	that	to	get	it	out	;	you	've	got	to	climb	those	cliffs	and	find	,	really	,	everything	that	existed	--	not	just	the	dinosaurs	,	but	the	entire	story	.	if	you	're	lucky	,	and	you	dig	a	place	like	that	,	you	actually	find	the	ash	bed	to	dig	it	,	and	we	did	.
228	million	years	old	,	we	found	what	really	is	the	most	primitive	dinosaur	:	that	's	the	ur	-	dinosaur	.
a	three	-	and	-	a	-	half	foot	thing	,	beautiful	skull	,	predator	,	meat	-	eater	,	a	two	-	legged	animal	.
so	,	all	the	other	dinosaurs	that	you	know	,	or	your	kids	know	,	at	least	,	on	four	legs	.
this	is	sort	of	a	look	at	the	skull	,	and	it	's	an	absolutely	fantastic	thing	about	five	or	six	inches	long	.
it	looks	rather	bird	-	like	because	it	is	.
it	's	bird	-	like	and	hollow	.
a	predator	.	maybe	25	pounds	,	or	10	kilograms	.
that	's	where	dinosaurs	began	.	that	's	where	the	radiation	began	.
that	is	10	times	larger	than	the	mammal	radiation	,	which	was	a	four	-	legged	radiation	.
we	are	extremely	dinosaur	-	like	,	and	unusual	in	our	two	-	legged	approach	to	life	.
now	,	if	you	want	to	understand	what	happened	then	when	the	continents	broke	apart	,	and	dinosaurs	found	--	landlubbers	,	as	they	are	--	found	themselves	adrift	.	there	's	some	missing	puzzle	pieces	.
most	of	those	missing	puzzle	pieces	are	southern	continents	,	because	it	was	those	continents	that	are	least	explored	.
if	you	want	to	add	to	this	picture	and	try	and	sketch	it	globally	,	you	really	have	to	force	yourself	to	go	down	to	the	four	corners	of	the	earth	--	africa	,	india	,	antarctica	,	australia	--	and	start	putting	together	some	of	these	pieces	.
i	've	been	to	some	of	those	continents	,	but	africa	was	,	in	the	words	of	steven	pinker	,	was	a	blank	slate	,	largely	.
but	one	with	an	immense	chalkboard	in	the	middle	,	with	lots	of	little	areas	of	dinosaur	rock	if	you	could	survive	an	expedition	.
there	's	no	roads	into	the	sahara	.	it	's	an	enormous	place	.
to	be	able	to	excavate	the	80	tons	of	dinosaurs	that	we	have	in	the	sahara	and	take	them	out	,	you	really	have	to	put	together	an	expedition	team	that	can	handle	the	conditions	.
some	of	them	are	political	.	many	of	them	are	physical	.
some	of	them	--	the	most	important	--	are	mental	.
and	you	really	have	to	be	able	to	withstand	conditions	--	you	have	to	drive	into	the	desert	,	you	will	see	landscapes	in	many	cases	--	you	can	see	from	what	we	've	discovered	--	that	nobody	else	has	ever	seen	.
and	the	kinds	of	teams	they	bring	in	?
well	,	they	're	people	who	understand	science	as	adventure	with	a	purpose	.
they	're	usually	students	who	've	never	seen	a	desert	.
some	of	them	are	more	experienced	.
your	job	as	a	leader	--	this	is	definitely	a	team	sport	--	your	job	as	a	leader	is	to	try	to	inspire	them	to	do	more	work	than	they	've	ever	done	in	their	life	under	conditions	that	they	ca	n't	imagine	.
so	,	125	degrees	is	normal	.
the	ground	surface	at	150	--	typical	.
so	,	you	ca	n't	leave	your	normal	metal	tools	out	because	you	'll	get	a	first	-	degree	burn	if	you	grab	them	sometimes	.
so	,	you	are	finding	yourself	also	in	an	amazing	cultural	milieu	.
you	're	really	rubbing	shoulders	with	the	world	's	last	great	nomadic	people	.
these	are	the	tuareg	nomads	,	and	they	're	living	their	lives	much	as	they	have	for	centuries	.
your	job	is	to	excavate	things	like	this	in	the	foreground	,	and	make	them	enter	the	pages	of	history	.
to	do	that	,	you	've	got	to	actually	transport	them	thousands	of	miles	out	of	the	desert	.
we	're	talking	about	ethiopia	,	but	let	's	talk	about	niger	--	or	niger	,	in	our	english	language	--	north	of	nigeria	--	that	's	where	this	photograph	was	taken	.
basically	you	're	talking	about	a	country	that	,	when	we	started	working	there	,	did	not	have	container	traffic	.
you	transported	the	bones	out	yourself	to	the	coast	of	africa	,	onto	a	boat	,	if	you	wanted	to	get	them	out	of	the	middle	of	the	sahara	.
that	's	a	2,000	mile	journey	.
so	enormous	excavations	and	a	lot	of	work	,	and	out	of	essentially	a	partial	herd	of	dinosaurs	that	you	saw	buried	there	--	20	tons	of	material	--	we	erect	jobaria	,	a	sauropod	dinosaur	like	we	have	n't	seen	on	some	other	continents	.
it	really	is	a	little	bit	out	of	place	temporally	.
it	looks	nothing	like	what	we	would	find	if	we	dug	in	contemporary	beds	in	north	america	.
here	's	the	animal	that	was	causing	it	trouble	.
and	,	you	know	,	on	and	on	--	a	whole	menagerie	.	when	you	pick	up	something	like	this	--	and	some	of	you	have	had	the	chance	to	touch	it	--	this	is	a	piece	of	history	.	you	're	touching	something	that	's	110	million	years	old	.
this	is	a	thumb	claw	.	there	it	was	,	moments	after	it	was	discovered	.
it	is	an	incredible	view	of	life	,	and	it	really	began	when	we	began	to	understand	the	depth	of	time	.
it	's	only	been	with	us	for	less	than	a	century	,	and	in	that	time	,	that	fourth	dimension	,	when	radioactive	dating	came	about	,	less	than	a	century	ago	,	and	we	could	actually	tell	how	old	some	of	these	things	were	,	is	probably	the	most	profound	transformation	,	because	it	changes	the	way	we	look	at	ourselves	and	the	world	dramatically	.
when	you	pick	up	a	piece	of	history	like	that	,	i	think	it	can	transform	kids	that	are	possibly	interested	in	science	.
that	's	the	animal	that	thumb	claw	came	from	:	suchomimus	.
here	's	some	others	.
this	is	something	we	found	in	morocco	,	an	immense	animal	.
we	prototyped	by	cat	-	scanning	the	brain	out	of	this	animal	.
it	turns	out	to	have	a	forebrain	one	-	fifteenth	the	size	of	a	human	.
this	was	the	cover	of	science	,	because	they	thought	that	humans	were	more	intelligent	than	these	animals	,	but	we	can	see	by	some	in	our	administration	that	despite	the	enormous	advantage	in	brain	volume	some	of	the	attitudes	remain	the	same	.	anyway	,	all	the	stuff	from	jurassic	park	that	you	know	of	--	all	those	small	animals	--	they	all	come	from	northern	continents	.
this	is	the	first	skeleton	from	a	southern	continent	,	and	guess	what	?	you	start	preparing	it	.
it	has	no	big	claw	on	its	hind	foot	.	it	does	n't	look	like	a	velociraptor	.
it	's	really	a	wholly	separate	radiation	.
so	what	we	're	trying	to	piece	together	here	is	a	story	.
it	involves	flying	reptiles	like	this	pterosaur	that	we	reconstructed	from	africa	.
crocodiles	,	of	course	,	and	that	's	a	nasty	one	we	have	n't	named	yet	.
and	huge	things	--	i	mean	,	this	is	a	lower	jaw	just	laying	there	in	the	desert	of	this	enormous	crocodile	.
the	crocodile	is	technically	called	sarcosuchus	.
that	's	an	adult	orinoco	crocodile	in	its	jaws	.
we	had	to	try	and	reconstruct	this	.
we	had	to	actually	look	at	recent	crocodiles	to	understand	how	crocodiles	scale	.
could	i	have	the	second	little	video	clip	?
now	,	this	field	is	just	--	and	,	of	course	,	science	in	general	--	is	just	--	adventure	.
we	had	to	find	and	measure	the	largest	crocodiles	living	today	.
narrator	:	...	as	long	as	their	boat	.
man	:	look	at	that	set	of	choppers	!	yeah	,	he	's	a	big	one	.
narrator	:	if	they	can	just	land	it	,	this	croc	will	provide	useful	data	,	helping	paul	in	his	quest	to	understand	sarcosuchus	.
man	:	ok	,	hand	me	some	more	here	.	man	2	:	ok	.
narrator	:	it	falls	to	paul	to	cover	its	eyes	.
man	:	watch	out	!	watch	out	!	no	,	no	,	no	,	no	.	you	're	going	to	have	to	get	on	the	back	legs	.
man	:	i	got	the	back	legs	.
man	2	:	you	have	the	back	legs	?	no	,	you	have	the	front	legs	,	my	friend	.
i	've	got	it	.	i	've	got	the	back	legs	.
somebody	get	the	front	legs	.
paul	sereno	:	let	's	get	this	tape	measure	on	him	.	put	it	right	there	.
wow	.
sixty	-	five	.	wow	.
that	's	a	big	skull	.
narrator	:	big	,	but	less	than	half	the	size	of	supercroc	's	skull	.
man	:	enormous	.	ps	:	you	've	got	a	...	14	-	foot	croc	.
man	:	i	knew	it	was	big	.
ps	:	do	n't	get	off	.	you	do	n't	get	off	,	but	do	n't	worry	about	me	.
narrator	:	paul	has	his	data	,	so	they	decide	to	release	the	animal	back	into	the	river	.
ps	:	do	n't	get	off	!	do	n't	get	off	!	do	n't	get	off	!
narrator	:	paul	has	never	seen	a	fossil	do	that	.
ps	:	okay	,	when	i	say	three	,	we	move	.
one	,	two	,	three	!
whoa	!
so	--	there	were	--	well	,	you	know	,	the	--	the	fossil	record	is	truly	amazing	because	it	really	forces	you	to	look	at	living	animals	in	a	new	way	.
we	proved	with	those	measurements	that	crocodiles	scaled	isometrically	.
it	depended	on	the	shape	of	their	skull	,	though	,	so	we	had	to	actually	get	those	measurements	to	be	sure	that	we	had	reconstructed	and	could	prove	to	the	scientific	world	that	supercroc	in	fact	is	a	40	-	foot	crocodile	,	probably	a	male	.
anyway	,	you	find	other	things	,	too	.
i	'm	going	to	lead	an	expedition	to	the	sahara	to	dig	up	africa	's	largest	neolithic	site	.
we	found	this	last	year	.
two	hundred	skeletons	,	tools	,	jewelry	.
this	is	a	ceremonial	disk	.
an	amazing	record	of	the	colonization	of	the	sahara	5,000	years	ago	is	been	sitting	out	there	waiting	for	us	to	go	back	.	so	,	really	exciting	.
and	then	work	later	is	going	to	take	us	to	tibet	.
now	,	we	normally	think	of	tibet	as	a	highland	.
it	's	really	an	island	continent	.
it	was	a	precursor	to	india	,	a	messenger	from	gondwana	--	a	lost	paradise	of	dinosaurs	isolated	for	millions	of	years	.
no	one	's	found	them	.	we	know	where	they	are	,	and	we	're	going	to	go	and	get	them	next	year	.
they	're	only	between	13	and	14,000	feet	,	but	if	you	go	in	the	warm	part	of	the	year	,	it	's	o.k	.
now	,	i	tried	to	suture	together	a	dinosaur	evolutionary	history	so	that	we	can	try	to	understand	some	basic	patterns	of	evolution	.
i	've	talked	about	a	few	of	them	.	we	really	need	to	take	that	further	.
we	need	to	delve	into	this	mass	of	anatomy	that	we	've	been	compiling	to	understand	where	the	changes	are	occurring	and	what	this	means	.
we	ca	n't	predict	,	necessarily	,	what	will	happen	in	evolution	,	but	we	can	learn	some	of	the	rules	of	the	game	,	and	that	's	really	what	we	're	trying	to	do	.
with	regard	to	the	biogeographic	question	,	the	earth	is	dividing	.
these	are	all	landlubbing	animals	.	there	's	a	couple	of	choices	.
you	get	divided	,	and	a	continent	's	division	corresponds	to	a	fork	in	the	evolutionary	tree	,	or	you	're	crafty	,	and	you	manage	to	escape	from	one	to	the	other	and	erase	that	division	,	or	you	're	living	peacefully	on	each	side	,	and	on	one	side	you	just	go	extinct	,	and	you	survive	on	the	other	side	and	create	a	difference	.
and	the	fourth	thing	is	that	you	actually	did	one	or	the	other	of	those	three	things	,	but	the	paleontologist	never	found	you	.
and	you	take	those	four	instances	and	you	realize	you	have	a	complex	problem	.
and	so	,	in	addition	to	digging	,	i	think	we	have	some	answers	from	the	dinosaur	record	.	i	think	these	dinosaurs	migrated	--	we	call	it	dispersal	--	around	the	globe	,	with	the	slightest	land	bridge	.
they	did	it	within	two	or	three	degrees	of	the	pole	,	to	maintain	similarity	between	continents	.
but	when	they	were	divided	,	indeed	they	were	divided	,	and	we	do	see	the	continents	carving	differences	among	dinosaurs	.
but	there	's	one	thing	that	's	even	more	important	,	and	i	think	that	's	extinction	.
we	have	downgraded	this	factor	.
it	carves	up	the	history	of	life	,	and	gives	us	the	differences	that	we	see	in	the	dinosaur	world	towards	the	end	,	right	before	the	bolide	impact	.
the	best	way	to	test	this	is	to	actually	create	a	model	.
so	if	we	move	back	,	this	is	a	two	-	dimensional	typical	tree	of	life	.
i	want	to	give	you	three	dimensions	.
so	you	see	the	tree	of	life	,	but	now	i	've	added	the	dimension	of	area	.
so	the	tree	of	life	is	normally	divergence	over	time	.
now	we	have	divergence	over	time	,	but	we	've	created	the	third	dimension	of	area	.
this	is	a	computer	program	which	has	three	knobs	.
we	can	control	those	things	that	we	're	worried	about	:	extinction	,	sampling	,	dispersal	--	going	from	one	area	to	another	.
and	ultimately	we	can	control	the	branching	to	mimic	what	we	think	the	continents	were	like	,	and	run	it	a	thousand	times	,	so	we	can	estimate	the	parameters	,	to	answer	the	question	whether	we	are	on	the	mark	or	not	,	at	least	to	know	the	barriers	of	the	problems	.	so	that	's	a	little	bit	about	the	science	.
today	i	'm	going	to	spend	the	rest	of	my	few	minutes	up	here	talking	about	the	other	stuff	that	i	do	in	chicago	,	which	is	related	to	the	fact	that	i	never	--	and	actually	,	in	talking	to	a	lot	of	tedsters	,	there	's	a	number	of	you	out	there	--	i	do	n't	know	that	i	'd	get	an	answer	honestly	,	if	i	asked	you	to	raise	your	hand	,	but	there	are	a	number	of	you	out	there	that	started	your	scientific	,	technical	,	entertainment	career	as	failures	,	by	society	's	standards	,	as	failures	by	schools	.
i	was	one	of	those	.	i	was	failed	by	my	school	--	my	school	failed	me	.
who	's	pointing	fingers	?
several	teachers	nearly	killed	me	.
i	found	myself	in	art	.
i	was	a	total	failure	in	school	,	not	really	headed	to	graduate	high	school	.
and	i	went	on	--	that	's	my	first	painting	on	canvas	.
i	read	a	dictionary	.	i	got	into	college	.
i	became	an	artist	.	o.k	.	,	and	started	drawing	.
it	became	abstract	.
i	worked	up	a	portfolio	,	and	i	was	headed	to	new	york	.
sometimes	i	would	see	bones	when	there	was	a	body	there	.
something	was	going	on	in	the	background	.	i	headed	to	new	york	to	a	studio	.
i	took	a	side	trip	to	the	american	museum	,	and	i	never	recovered	.
but	really	it	's	the	same	discipline	--	they	're	kindred	disciplines	.
i	mean	,	is	there	anything	that	is	not	visualizing	what	ca	n't	be	seen	,	in	terms	of	discovering	this	dinosaur	bone	from	a	small	piece	of	it	that	's	out	there	,	or	seeing	the	distortion	that	we	try	to	see	as	evolutionary	distortion	in	one	animal	to	another	?
this	is	a	very	extraordinarily	visual	.
i	give	you	a	human	face	because	you	're	experts	at	that	.
it	takes	us	years	to	understand	how	to	do	that	with	dinosaurs	.
they	're	really	kindred	disciplines	.
but	what	we	're	trying	to	create	in	chicago	is	a	way	to	get	,	collect	together	,	those	students	who	are	least	represented	in	our	science	and	technology	spheres	.
we	all	know	,	and	there	's	been	several	allusions	to	it	,	that	we	are	failing	in	our	ability	to	produce	enough	scientists	,	engineers	and	technicians	.
we	've	known	that	for	a	long	time	.	we	've	gone	through	the	sputnik	phase	,	and	now	,	as	you	see	the	increase	in	the	pace	of	what	we	're	doing	,	it	becomes	even	more	prominent	.	where	are	all	these	people	going	to	come	from	?
and	a	more	general	question	for	our	society	is	,	what	's	going	to	happen	to	all	the	rest	that	are	left	behind	?
what	about	all	the	kids	like	me	that	were	in	school	--	kids	like	some	of	you	out	there	--	that	were	in	school	and	did	n't	get	a	chance	and	will	never	get	a	chance	to	participate	in	science	and	technology	?
those	are	the	questions	i	ask	.	and	we	talk	about	ethiopia	,	and	it	's	very	important	.
niger	is	equally	important	,	and	i	'm	trying	desperately	to	do	something	in	niger	.
they	have	an	aids	problem	.	i	asked	--	the	u.s.	state	department	asked	the	government	recently	,	what	do	you	want	to	do	?	and	they	gave	them	two	problems	.
dinosaurs	was	one	of	them	.
give	us	a	museum	of	dinosaurs	,	and	we	will	attract	tourists	,	which	is	our	number	two	industry	.
and	i	hope	to	god	the	united	states	government	,	me	,	or	ted	,	or	somebody	helps	us	do	that	,	because	that	would	be	an	incredible	thing	for	their	country	.
but	when	we	look	back	at	our	own	country	,	we	're	looking	back	at	our	cities	,	the	cities	where	most	of	you	come	from	--	certainly	the	city	i	come	from	--	there	's	legions	of	kids	out	there	like	these	.
and	the	question	is	--	and	we	started	to	address	this	question	for	centuries	--	as	to	how	we	get	these	kids	involved	in	science	.
we	've	started	in	chicago	an	organization	--	a	non	-	profit	organization	--	called	project	exploration	.
these	are	two	kids	from	project	exploration	.
we	met	them	in	their	early	stages	in	high	school	.	they	were	--	failing	to	poor	students	,	and	they	are	now	--	one	at	the	university	of	chicago	,	another	in	illinois	.
we	've	got	students	at	harvard	.	we	're	six	years	old	.
and	we	created	a	track	record	.
because	when	you	go	out	there	as	a	scholar	,	and	you	try	to	find	out	longitudinal	studies	,	track	records	like	that	,	there	essentially	are	very	few	,	if	none	.
so	,	we	've	created	an	incredible	track	record	of	100	percent	graduation	,	90	percent	going	to	college	,	many	first	-	generation	,	90	percent	of	those	choosing	science	as	a	career	.
it	's	an	impressive	track	record	,	and	so	we	look	back	and	we	say	,	well	,	we	did	n't	really	exactly	work	this	out	theoretically	from	the	start	,	but	when	we	look	back	,	there	are	theoretical	movements	in	science	education	.
it	's	gone	through	science	as	an	inquiry	,	which	was	a	big	advance	,	and	dewey	back	at	chicago	--	you	learn	by	doing	.
to	--	you	learn	by	envisioning	yourself	as	a	scientist	,	and	then	you	learn	to	envision	yourself	as	a	scientist	.
the	next	step	is	to	learn	the	capability	to	make	yourself	a	scientist	.
you	have	to	have	those	steps	.	if	you	have	--	it	's	easy	to	get	kids	interested	in	science	.
it	's	hard	to	get	them	to	envision	themselves	as	a	scientist	,	which	involves	standing	up	in	front	of	people	like	we	're	doing	here	at	this	symposium	and	presenting	something	as	a	knowledgeable	person	,	and	then	seeing	yourself	in	the	role	as	a	scientist	and	giving	yourself	the	tools	to	pursue	that	.
and	so	,	that	's	what	we	're	going	to	do	.	we	're	planning	a	permanent	home	in	chicago	.
we	have	lots	of	ideas	,	but	i	guarantee	you	this	one	thing	--	and	i	've	talked	to	some	people	here	at	ted	--	it	's	not	going	to	look	like	anything	you	've	seen	before	.
it	's	going	to	be	part	-	school	,	part	-	museum	hall	,	part	-	conservatory	,	part	-	zoo	,	and	part	of	an	answer	to	the	problem	of	how	you	interest	kids	in	science	.
thank	you	very	much	.
