so	i	'm	going	to	talk	about	work	,	specifically	why	people	ca	n't	seem	to	get	work	done	at	work	,	which	is	a	problem	we	all	kind	of	have	.
but	let	's	,	sort	of	,	start	at	the	beginning	.
so	we	have	companies	and	non	-	profits	and	charities	and	all	these	groups	that	have	employees	or	volunteers	of	some	sort	.
and	they	expect	these	people	who	work	for	them	to	do	great	work	--	i	would	hope	,	at	least	.
at	least	good	work	,	hopefully	,	at	least	it	's	good	work	--	hopefully	great	work	.
and	so	what	they	typically	do	is	they	decide	that	all	these	people	need	to	come	together	in	one	place	to	do	that	work	.
so	a	company	,	or	a	charity	,	or	an	organization	of	any	kind	,	they	typically	--	unless	you	're	working	in	africa	,	if	you	're	really	lucky	to	do	that	--	most	people	have	to	go	to	an	office	every	day	.
and	so	these	companies	,	they	build	offices	.
they	go	out	and	they	buy	a	building	,	or	they	rent	a	building	,	or	they	lease	some	space	,	and	they	fill	the	space	with	stuff	.
they	fill	it	with	tables	,	or	desks	,	chairs	,	computer	equipment	,	software	,	internet	access	,	maybe	a	fridge	,	maybe	a	few	other	things	,	and	they	expect	their	employees	,	or	their	volunteers	,	to	come	to	that	location	every	day	to	do	great	work	.
it	seems	like	it	's	perfectly	reasonable	to	ask	that	.
however	,	if	you	actually	talk	to	people	and	even	question	yourself	,	and	you	ask	yourself	,	where	do	you	really	want	to	go	when	you	really	need	to	get	something	done	?
you	'll	find	out	that	people	do	n't	say	what	businesses	think	they	would	say	.
if	you	ask	people	the	question	:	where	do	you	really	need	to	go	when	you	need	to	get	something	done	?
typically	you	get	three	different	kinds	of	answers	.
one	is	kind	of	a	place	or	a	location	or	a	room	.
another	one	is	a	moving	object	and	a	third	is	a	time	.
so	here	's	some	examples	.
when	i	ask	people	--	and	i	've	been	asking	people	this	question	for	about	10	years	--	i	ask	them	,	``	where	do	you	go	when	you	really	need	to	get	something	done	?	``
i	'll	hear	things	like	,	the	porch	,	the	deck	,	the	kitchen	.
i	'll	hear	things	like	an	extra	room	in	the	house	,	the	basement	,	the	coffee	shop	,	the	library	.
and	then	you	'll	hear	things	like	the	train	,	a	plane	,	a	car	--	so	,	the	commute	.
and	then	you	'll	hear	people	say	,	``	well	,	it	does	n't	really	matter	where	i	am	,	as	long	as	it	's	really	early	in	the	morning	or	really	late	at	night	or	on	the	weekends	.	``
you	almost	never	hear	someone	say	the	office	.
but	businesses	are	spending	all	this	money	on	this	place	called	the	office	,	and	they	're	making	people	go	to	it	all	the	time	,	yet	people	do	n't	do	work	in	the	office	.
what	is	that	about	?
why	is	that	?
why	is	that	happening	?
and	what	you	find	out	is	that	,	if	you	dig	a	little	bit	deeper	,	you	find	out	that	people	--	this	is	what	happens	--	people	go	to	work	,	and	they	're	basically	trading	in	their	workday	for	a	series	of	``	work	moments	.	``
that	's	what	happens	at	the	office	.
you	do	n't	have	a	workday	anymore	.	you	have	work	moments	.
it	's	like	the	front	door	of	the	office	is	like	a	cuisinart	,	and	you	walk	in	and	your	day	is	shredded	to	bits	,	because	you	have	15	minutes	here	and	30	minutes	there	,	and	then	something	else	happens	and	you	're	pulled	off	your	work	,	and	you	've	got	to	do	something	else	,	then	you	have	20	minutes	,	then	it	's	lunch	.
then	you	have	something	else	to	do	.
then	you	've	got	15	minutes	,	and	someone	pulls	you	aside	and	asks	you	this	question	,	and	before	you	know	it	,	it	's	5	p.m.	,	and	you	look	back	on	the	day	,	and	you	realize	that	you	did	n't	get	anything	done	.
i	mean	,	we	've	all	been	through	this	.
we	probably	went	through	it	yesterday	,	or	the	day	before	,	or	the	day	before	that	.
you	look	back	on	your	day	,	and	you	're	like	,	i	got	nothing	done	today	.
i	was	at	work	.
i	sat	at	my	desk	.	i	used	my	expensive	computer	.
i	used	the	software	they	told	me	to	use	.
i	went	to	these	meetings	i	was	asked	to	go	to	.
i	did	these	conference	calls	.	i	did	all	this	stuff	.
but	i	did	n't	actually	do	anything	.
i	just	did	tasks	.
i	did	n't	actually	get	meaningful	work	done	.
and	what	you	find	is	that	,	especially	with	creative	people	--	designers	,	programmers	,	writers	,	engineers	,	thinkers	--	that	people	really	need	long	stretches	of	uninterrupted	time	to	get	something	done	.
you	can	not	ask	somebody	to	be	creative	in	15	minutes	and	really	think	about	a	problem	.
you	might	have	a	quick	idea	,	but	to	be	in	deep	thought	about	a	problem	and	really	consider	a	problem	carefully	,	you	need	long	stretches	of	uninterrupted	time	.
and	even	though	the	workday	is	typically	eight	hours	,	how	many	people	here	have	ever	had	eight	hours	to	themselves	at	the	office	?
how	about	seven	hours	?
six	?	five	?	four	?
when	's	the	last	time	you	had	three	hours	to	yourself	at	the	office	?
two	hours	?	one	,	maybe	?
very	,	very	few	people	actually	have	long	stretches	of	uninterrupted	time	at	an	office	.
and	this	is	why	people	choose	to	do	work	at	home	,	or	they	might	go	to	the	office	,	but	they	might	go	to	the	office	really	early	in	the	day	,	or	late	at	night	when	no	one	's	around	,	or	they	stick	around	after	everyone	's	left	,	or	they	go	in	on	the	weekends	,	or	they	get	work	done	on	the	plane	,	or	they	get	work	done	in	the	car	or	in	the	train	because	there	are	no	distractions	.
now	,	there	are	different	kinds	of	distractions	,	but	there	are	n't	the	really	bad	kinds	of	distractions	that	i	'll	talk	about	in	just	a	minute	.
and	this	sort	of	whole	phenomenon	of	having	short	bursts	of	time	to	get	things	done	reminds	me	of	another	thing	that	does	n't	work	when	you	're	interrupted	,	and	that	is	sleep	.
i	think	that	sleep	and	work	are	very	closely	related	,	and	it	's	not	just	that	you	can	work	while	you	're	sleeping	and	you	can	sleep	while	you	're	working	.
that	's	not	really	what	i	mean	.
i	'm	talking	specifically	about	the	fact	that	sleep	and	work	are	phased	-	based	,	or	stage	-	based	,	events	.
so	sleep	is	about	sleep	phases	,	or	stages	--	some	people	call	them	different	things	.
there	's	five	of	them	,	and	in	order	to	get	to	the	really	deep	ones	,	the	really	meaningful	ones	,	you	have	to	go	through	the	early	ones	.
and	if	you	're	interrupted	while	you	're	going	through	the	early	ones	--	if	someone	bumps	you	in	bed	,	or	if	there	's	a	sound	,	or	whatever	happens	--	you	do	n't	just	pick	up	where	you	left	off	.
if	you	're	interrupted	and	woken	up	,	you	have	to	start	again	.
so	you	have	to	go	back	a	few	phases	and	start	again	.
and	what	ends	up	happening	--	sometimes	you	might	have	days	like	this	where	you	wake	up	at	eight	in	the	morning	,	or	seven	in	the	morning	,	or	whenever	you	get	up	,	and	you	're	like	,	man	,	i	did	n't	really	sleep	very	well	.
i	did	the	sleep	thing	--	i	went	to	bed	,	i	laid	down	--	but	i	did	n't	really	sleep	.
people	say	you	go	to	sleep	,	but	you	really	do	n't	go	to	sleep	,	you	go	towards	sleep	.
it	just	takes	a	while	.	you	've	got	to	go	through	these	phases	and	stuff	,	and	if	you	're	interrupted	,	you	do	n't	sleep	well	.
so	how	do	we	expect	--	does	anyone	here	expect	someone	to	sleep	well	if	they	're	interrupted	all	night	?
i	do	n't	think	anyone	would	say	yes	.
why	do	we	expect	people	to	work	well	if	they	're	being	interrupted	all	day	at	the	office	?
how	can	we	possibly	expect	people	to	do	their	job	if	they	're	going	to	the	office	to	be	interrupted	?
that	does	n't	really	seem	like	it	makes	a	lot	of	sense	to	me	.
so	what	are	these	interruptions	that	happen	at	the	office	that	do	n't	happen	at	other	places	?
because	in	other	places	,	you	can	have	interruptions	,	like	,	you	can	have	the	tv	,	or	you	could	go	for	a	walk	,	or	there	's	a	fridge	downstairs	,	or	you	've	got	your	own	couch	,	or	whatever	you	want	to	do	.
and	if	you	talk	to	certain	managers	,	they	'll	tell	you	that	they	do	n't	want	their	employees	to	work	at	home	because	of	these	distractions	.
they	'll	also	say	--	sometimes	they	'll	also	say	,	``	well	,	if	i	ca	n't	see	the	person	,	how	do	i	know	they	're	working	?	``
which	is	ridiculous	,	of	course	,	but	that	's	one	of	the	excuses	that	managers	give	.
and	i	'm	one	of	these	managers	.
i	understand	.	i	know	how	this	goes	.
we	all	have	to	improve	on	this	sort	of	thing	.
but	oftentimes	they	'll	cite	distractions	.
``	i	ca	n't	let	someone	work	at	home	.
they	'll	watch	tv	.	they	'll	do	this	other	thing	.	``
it	turns	out	that	those	are	n't	the	things	that	are	really	distracting	.
because	those	are	voluntary	distractions	.
you	decide	when	you	want	to	be	distracted	by	the	tv	.
you	decide	when	you	want	to	turn	something	on	.
you	decide	when	you	want	to	go	downstairs	or	go	for	a	walk	.
at	the	office	,	most	of	the	interruptions	and	distractions	that	really	cause	people	not	to	get	work	done	are	involuntary	.
so	let	's	go	through	a	couple	of	those	.
now	,	managers	and	bosses	will	often	have	you	think	that	the	real	distractions	at	work	are	things	like	facebook	and	twitter	and	youtube	and	other	websites	,	and	in	fact	,	they	'll	go	so	far	as	to	actually	ban	these	sites	at	work	.
some	of	you	may	work	at	places	where	you	ca	n't	get	to	these	certain	sites	.
i	mean	,	is	this	china	?	what	the	hell	is	going	on	here	?
you	ca	n't	go	to	a	website	at	work	,	and	that	's	the	problem	,	that	's	why	people	are	n't	getting	work	done	,	because	they	're	going	to	facebook	and	they	're	going	to	twitter	?
that	's	kind	of	ridiculous	.	it	's	a	total	decoy	.
and	today	's	facebook	and	twitter	and	youtube	,	these	things	are	just	modern	-	day	smoke	breaks	.
no	one	cared	about	letting	people	take	a	smoke	break	for	15	minutes	10	years	ago	,	so	why	does	everyone	care	about	someone	going	to	facebook	here	and	there	,	or	twitter	here	and	there	,	or	youtube	here	and	there	?
those	are	n't	the	real	problems	in	the	office	.
the	real	problems	are	what	i	like	to	call	the	m	&	ms	,	the	managers	and	the	meetings	.
those	are	the	real	problems	in	the	modern	office	today	.
and	this	is	why	things	do	n't	get	done	at	work	--	it	's	because	of	the	m	&	ms	.
now	what	's	interesting	is	,	if	you	listen	to	all	the	places	that	people	talk	about	doing	work	--	like	at	home	,	or	in	a	car	,	or	on	a	plane	,	or	late	at	night	,	or	early	in	the	morning	--	you	do	n't	find	managers	and	meetings	.
you	find	a	lot	of	other	distractions	,	but	you	do	n't	find	managers	and	meetings	.
so	these	are	the	things	that	you	do	n't	find	elsewhere	,	but	you	do	find	at	the	office	.
and	managers	are	basically	people	whose	job	it	is	to	interrupt	people	.
that	's	pretty	much	what	managers	are	for	.	they	're	for	interrupting	people	.
they	do	n't	really	do	the	work	,	so	they	have	to	make	sure	everyone	else	is	doing	the	work	,	which	is	an	interruption	.
and	we	have	a	lot	of	managers	in	the	world	now	,	and	there	's	a	lot	of	people	in	the	world	now	,	and	there	's	a	lot	of	interruptions	in	the	world	now	because	of	these	managers	.
they	have	to	check	in	:	``	hey	,	how	's	it	going	?
show	me	what	's	up	,	``	and	this	sort	of	thing	and	they	keep	interrupting	you	at	the	wrong	time	,	while	you	're	actually	trying	to	do	something	they	're	paying	you	to	do	,	they	tend	to	interrupt	you	.
that	's	kind	of	bad	.
but	what	's	even	worse	is	the	thing	that	managers	do	most	of	all	,	which	is	call	meetings	.
and	meetings	are	just	toxic	,	terrible	,	poisonous	things	during	the	day	at	work	.
we	all	know	this	to	be	true	,	and	you	would	never	see	a	spontaneous	meeting	called	by	employees	.
it	does	n't	work	that	way	.
the	manager	calls	the	meeting	so	the	employees	can	all	come	together	,	and	it	's	an	incredibly	disruptive	thing	to	do	to	people	--	is	to	say	,	``	hey	look	,	we	're	going	to	bring	10	people	together	right	now	and	have	a	meeting	.
i	do	n't	care	what	you	're	doing	.
just	,	you	've	got	to	stop	doing	what	you	're	doing	,	so	you	can	have	this	meeting	.	``
i	mean	,	what	are	the	chances	that	all	10	people	are	ready	to	stop	?
what	if	they	're	thinking	about	something	important	?
what	if	they	're	doing	important	work	?
all	of	a	sudden	you	're	telling	them	that	they	have	to	stop	doing	that	to	do	something	else	.
so	they	go	into	a	meeting	room	,	they	get	together	,	and	they	talk	about	stuff	that	does	n't	really	matter	usually	.
because	meetings	are	n't	work	.
meetings	are	places	to	go	to	talk	about	things	you	're	supposed	to	be	doing	later	.
but	meetings	also	procreate	.
so	one	meeting	tends	to	lead	to	another	meeting	and	tends	to	lead	to	another	meeting	.
there	's	often	too	many	people	in	the	meetings	,	and	they	're	very	,	very	expensive	to	the	organization	.
companies	often	think	of	a	one	-	hour	meeting	as	a	one	-	hour	meeting	,	but	that	's	not	true	,	unless	there	's	only	one	person	in	that	meeting	.
if	there	are	10	people	in	the	meeting	,	it	's	a	10	-	hour	meeting	;	it	's	not	a	one	-	hour	meeting	.
it	's	10	hours	of	productivity	taken	from	the	rest	of	the	organization	to	have	this	one	one	-	hour	meeting	,	which	probably	should	have	been	handled	by	two	or	three	people	talking	for	a	few	minutes	.
but	instead	,	there	's	a	long	scheduled	meeting	,	because	meetings	are	scheduled	the	way	software	works	,	which	is	in	increments	of	15	minutes	,	or	30	minutes	,	or	an	hour	.
you	do	n't	schedule	an	eight	-	hour	meeting	with	outlook	.
you	ca	n't	.	i	do	n't	even	know	if	you	can	.
you	can	go	15	minutes	or	30	minutes	or	45	minutes	or	an	hour	.
and	so	we	tend	to	fill	these	times	up	when	things	should	really	go	really	quickly	.
so	meetings	and	managers	are	two	major	problems	in	businesses	today	,	especially	to	offices	.
these	things	do	n't	exist	outside	of	the	office	.
so	i	have	some	suggestions	to	remedy	the	situation	.
what	can	managers	do	--	enlightened	managers	,	hopefully	--	what	can	they	do	to	make	the	office	a	better	place	for	people	to	work	,	so	it	's	not	the	last	resort	,	but	it	's	the	first	resort	?
it	's	that	people	start	to	say	,	``	when	i	really	want	to	get	stuff	done	,	i	go	to	the	office	.	``
because	the	offices	are	well	equipped	,	everything	should	be	there	for	them	to	do	their	work	,	but	they	do	n't	want	to	go	there	right	now	,	so	how	do	we	change	that	?
i	have	three	suggestions	i	'll	share	with	you	guys	.
i	have	about	three	minutes	,	so	that	'll	fit	perfectly	.
we	've	all	heard	of	the	casual	friday	thing	.
i	do	n't	know	if	people	still	do	that	.
but	how	about	``	no	-	talk	thursdays	?	``
how	about	--	pick	one	thursday	once	a	month	and	cut	that	day	in	half	and	just	say	the	afternoon	--	i	'll	make	it	really	easy	for	you	.
so	just	the	afternoon	,	one	thursday	.
the	first	thursday	of	the	month	--	just	the	afternoon	--	nobody	in	the	office	can	talk	to	each	other	.
just	silence	,	that	's	it	.
and	what	you	'll	find	is	that	a	tremendous	amount	of	work	actually	gets	done	when	no	one	talks	to	each	other	.
this	is	when	people	actually	get	stuff	done	,	is	when	no	one	's	bothering	them	,	when	no	one	's	interrupting	them	.
and	you	can	give	someone	--	giving	someone	four	hours	of	uninterrupted	time	is	the	best	gift	you	can	give	anybody	at	work	.
it	's	better	than	a	computer	.
it	's	better	than	a	new	monitor	.	it	's	better	than	new	software	,	or	whatever	people	typically	use	.
giving	them	four	hours	of	quiet	time	at	the	office	is	going	to	be	incredibly	valuable	.
and	if	you	try	that	,	i	think	you	'll	find	that	you	agree	.
and	maybe	,	hopefully	you	can	do	it	more	often	.
so	maybe	it	's	every	other	week	,	or	every	week	,	once	a	week	,	afternoons	no	one	can	talk	to	each	other	.
that	's	something	that	you	'll	find	will	really	,	really	work	.
another	thing	you	can	try	is	switching	from	active	communication	and	collaboration	,	which	is	like	face	-	to	-	face	stuff	,	tapping	people	on	the	shoulder	,	saying	hi	to	them	,	having	meetings	,	and	replace	that	with	more	passive	models	of	communication	,	using	things	like	email	and	instant	messaging	,	or	collaboration	products	--	things	like	that	.
now	some	people	might	say	email	is	really	distracting	and	i.m	.	is	really	distracting	,	and	these	other	things	are	really	distracting	,	but	they	're	distracting	at	a	time	of	your	own	choice	and	your	own	choosing	.
you	can	quit	the	email	app	;	you	ca	n't	quit	your	boss	.
you	can	quit	i.m	.	;	you	ca	n't	hide	your	manager	.
you	can	put	these	things	away	,	and	then	you	can	be	interrupted	on	your	own	schedule	,	at	your	own	time	,	when	you	're	available	,	when	you	're	ready	to	go	again	.
because	work	,	like	sleep	,	happens	in	phases	.
so	you	're	going	to	be	kind	of	going	up	and	doing	some	work	,	and	then	you	're	going	to	come	down	from	that	work	,	and	then	maybe	it	's	time	to	check	that	email	,	or	check	that	i.m	.
and	there	are	very	,	very	few	things	that	are	that	urgent	that	need	to	happen	,	that	need	to	be	answered	right	this	second	.
so	if	you	're	a	manager	,	start	encouraging	people	to	use	more	things	like	i.m	.	and	email	and	other	things	that	someone	else	can	put	away	and	then	get	back	to	you	on	their	own	schedule	.
and	the	last	suggestion	i	have	is	that	,	if	you	do	have	a	meeting	coming	up	,	if	you	have	the	power	,	just	cancel	.	just	cancel	that	next	meeting	.
today	's	friday	--	so	monday	,	usually	people	have	meetings	on	monday	.
just	do	n't	have	it	.
i	do	n't	mean	move	it	;	i	mean	just	erase	it	from	memory	,	it	's	gone	.
and	you	'll	find	out	that	everything	will	be	just	fine	.
all	these	discussions	and	decisions	you	thought	you	had	to	make	at	this	one	time	at	9	a.m.	on	monday	,	just	forget	about	them	,	and	things	will	be	just	fine	.
people	have	a	more	open	morning	,	they	can	actually	think	,	and	you	'll	find	out	that	maybe	all	these	things	you	thought	you	had	to	do	,	you	do	n't	actually	have	to	do	.
so	those	are	just	three	quick	suggestions	i	wanted	to	give	you	guys	to	think	about	this	.
and	i	hope	that	some	of	these	ideas	were	at	least	provocative	enough	for	managers	and	bosses	and	business	owners	and	organizers	and	people	who	are	in	charge	of	other	people	to	think	about	laying	off	a	little	bit	and	giving	people	some	more	time	to	get	some	work	done	.
and	i	think	it	'll	all	pay	off	in	the	end	.
so	thanks	for	listening	.
