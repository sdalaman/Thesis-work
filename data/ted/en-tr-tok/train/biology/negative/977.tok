one	of	my	favorite	parts	of	my	job	at	the	gates	foundation	is	that	i	get	to	travel	to	the	developing	world	,	and	i	do	that	quite	regularly	.
and	when	i	meet	the	mothers	in	so	many	of	these	remote	places	,	i	'm	really	struck	by	the	things	that	we	have	in	common	.
they	want	what	we	want	for	our	children	and	that	is	for	their	children	to	grow	up	successful	,	to	be	healthy	,	and	to	have	a	successful	life	.
but	i	also	see	lots	of	poverty	,	and	it	's	quite	jarring	,	both	in	the	scale	and	the	scope	of	it	.
my	first	trip	in	india	,	i	was	in	a	person	's	home	where	they	had	dirt	floors	,	no	running	water	,	no	electricity	,	and	that	's	really	what	i	see	all	over	the	world	.
so	in	short	,	i	'm	startled	by	all	the	things	that	they	do	n't	have	.
but	i	am	surprised	by	one	thing	that	they	do	have	:	coca	-	cola	.
coke	is	everywhere	.
in	fact	,	when	i	travel	to	the	developing	world	,	coke	feels	ubiquitous	.
and	so	when	i	come	back	from	these	trips	,	and	i	'm	thinking	about	development	,	and	i	'm	flying	home	and	i	'm	thinking	,	``	we	're	trying	to	deliver	condoms	to	people	or	vaccinations	,	``	you	know	,	coke	's	success	kind	of	stops	and	makes	you	wonder	:	how	is	it	that	they	can	get	coke	to	these	far	-	flung	places	?
if	they	can	do	that	,	why	ca	n't	governments	and	ngos	do	the	same	thing	?
and	i	'm	not	the	first	person	to	ask	this	question	.
but	i	think	,	as	a	community	,	we	still	have	a	lot	to	learn	.
it	's	staggering	,	if	you	think	about	coca	-	cola	.
they	sell	1.5	billion	servings	every	single	day	.
that	's	like	every	man	,	woman	and	child	on	the	planet	having	a	serving	of	coke	every	week	.
so	why	does	this	matter	?
well	,	if	we	're	going	to	speed	up	the	progress	and	go	even	faster	on	the	set	of	millennium	development	goals	that	we	're	set	as	a	world	,	we	need	to	learn	from	the	innovators	,	and	those	innovators	come	from	every	single	sector	.
i	feel	that	,	if	we	can	understand	what	makes	something	like	coca	-	cola	ubiquitous	,	we	can	apply	those	lessons	then	for	the	public	good	.
coke	's	success	is	relevant	,	because	if	we	can	analyze	it	,	learn	from	it	,	then	we	can	save	lives	.
so	that	's	why	i	took	a	bit	of	time	to	study	coke	.
and	i	think	there	are	really	three	things	we	can	take	away	from	coca	-	cola	.
they	take	real	-	time	data	and	immediately	feed	it	back	into	the	product	.
they	tap	into	local	entrepreneurial	talent	,	and	they	do	incredible	marketing	.
so	let	's	start	with	the	data	.
now	coke	has	a	very	clear	bottom	line	--	they	report	to	a	set	of	shareholders	,	they	have	to	turn	a	profit	.
so	they	take	the	data	,	and	they	use	it	to	measure	progress	.
they	have	this	very	continuous	feedback	loop	.
they	learn	something	,	they	put	it	back	into	the	product	,	they	put	it	back	into	the	market	.
they	have	a	whole	team	called	``	knowledge	and	insight	.	``
it	's	a	lot	like	other	consumer	companies	.
so	if	you	're	running	namibia	for	coca	-	cola	,	and	you	have	a	107	constituencies	,	you	know	where	every	can	versus	bottle	of	sprite	,	fanta	or	coke	was	sold	,	whether	it	was	a	corner	store	,	a	supermarket	or	a	pushcart	.
so	if	sales	start	to	drop	,	then	the	person	can	identify	the	problem	and	address	the	issue	.
let	's	contrast	that	for	a	minute	to	development	.
in	development	,	the	evaluation	comes	at	the	very	end	of	the	project	.
i	've	sat	in	a	lot	of	those	meetings	,	and	by	then	,	it	is	way	too	late	to	use	the	data	.
i	had	somebody	from	an	ngo	once	describe	it	to	me	as	bowling	in	the	dark	.
they	said	,	``	you	roll	the	ball	,	you	hear	some	pins	go	down	.
it	's	dark	,	you	ca	n't	see	which	one	goes	down	until	the	lights	come	on	,	and	then	you	an	see	your	impact	.	``
real	-	time	data	turns	on	the	lights	.
so	what	's	the	second	thing	that	coke	's	good	at	?
they	're	good	at	tapping	into	that	local	entrepreneurial	talent	.
coke	's	been	in	africa	since	1928	,	but	most	of	the	time	they	could	n't	reach	the	distant	markets	,	because	they	had	a	system	that	was	a	lot	like	in	the	developed	world	,	which	was	a	large	truck	rolling	down	the	street	.
and	in	africa	,	the	remote	places	,	it	's	hard	to	find	a	good	road	.
but	coke	noticed	something	--	they	noticed	that	local	people	were	taking	the	product	,	buying	it	in	bulk	and	then	reselling	it	in	these	hard	-	to	-	reach	places	.
and	so	they	took	a	bit	of	time	to	learn	about	that	.
and	they	decided	in	1990	that	they	wanted	to	start	training	the	local	entrepreneurs	,	giving	them	small	loans	.
they	set	them	up	as	what	they	called	micro	-	distribution	centers	,	and	those	local	entrepreneurs	then	hire	sales	people	,	who	go	out	with	bicycles	and	pushcarts	and	wheelbarrows	to	sell	the	product	.
there	are	now	some	3,000	of	these	centers	employing	about	15,000	people	in	africa	.
in	tanzania	and	uganda	,	they	represent	90	percent	of	coke	's	sales	.
let	's	look	at	the	development	side	.
what	is	it	that	governments	and	ngos	can	learn	from	coke	?
governments	and	ngos	need	to	tap	into	that	local	entrepreneurial	talent	as	well	,	because	the	locals	know	how	to	reach	the	very	hard	-	to	-	serve	places	,	their	neighbors	,	and	they	know	what	motivates	them	to	make	change	.
i	think	a	great	example	of	this	is	ethiopia	's	new	health	extension	program	.
the	government	noticed	in	ethiopia	that	many	of	the	people	were	so	far	away	from	a	health	clinic	,	they	were	over	a	day	's	travel	away	from	a	health	clinic	.
so	if	you	're	in	an	emergency	situation	--	or	if	you	're	a	mom	about	to	deliver	a	baby	--	forget	it	,	to	get	to	the	health	care	center	.
they	decided	that	was	n't	good	enough	,	so	they	went	to	india	and	studied	the	indian	state	of	kerala	that	also	had	a	system	like	this	,	and	they	adapted	it	for	ethiopia	.
and	in	2003	,	the	government	of	ethiopia	started	this	new	system	in	their	own	country	.
they	trained	35,000	health	extension	workers	to	deliver	care	directly	to	the	people	.
in	just	five	years	,	their	ratio	went	from	one	worker	for	every	30,000	people	to	one	worker	for	every	2,500	people	.
now	,	think	about	how	this	can	change	people	's	lives	.
health	extension	workers	can	help	with	so	many	things	,	whether	it	's	family	planning	,	prenatal	care	,	immunizations	for	the	children	,	or	advising	the	woman	to	get	to	the	facility	on	time	for	an	on	-	time	delivery	.
that	is	having	real	impact	in	a	country	like	ethiopia	,	and	it	's	why	you	see	their	child	mortality	numbers	coming	down	25	percent	from	2000	to	2008	.
in	ethiopia	,	there	are	hundreds	of	thousands	of	children	living	because	of	this	health	extension	worker	program	.
so	what	's	the	next	step	for	ethiopia	?
well	,	they	're	already	starting	talk	about	this	.
they	're	starting	to	talk	about	,	``	how	do	you	have	the	health	community	workers	generate	their	own	ideas	?
how	do	you	incent	them	based	on	the	impact	that	they	're	getting	out	in	those	remote	villages	?	``
that	's	how	you	tap	into	local	entrepreneurial	talent	and	you	unlock	people	's	potential	.
the	third	component	of	coke	's	success	is	marketing	.
ultimately	,	coke	's	success	depends	on	one	crucial	fact	and	that	is	that	people	want	a	coca	-	cola	.
now	the	reason	these	micro	-	entrepreneurs	can	sell	or	make	a	profit	is	they	have	to	sell	every	single	bottle	in	their	pushcart	or	their	wheelbarrow	.
so	,	they	rely	on	coca	-	cola	in	terms	of	its	marketing	,	and	what	's	the	secret	to	their	marketing	?
well	,	it	's	aspirational	.
it	is	associated	that	product	with	a	kind	of	life	that	people	want	to	live	.
so	even	though	it	's	a	global	company	,	they	take	a	very	local	approach	.
coke	's	global	campaign	slogan	is	``	open	happiness	.	``
but	they	localize	it	.
and	they	do	n't	just	guess	what	makes	people	happy	;	they	go	to	places	like	latin	america	and	they	realize	that	happiness	there	is	associated	with	family	life	.
and	in	south	africa	,	they	associate	happiness	with	seriti	or	community	respect	.
now	,	that	played	itself	out	in	the	world	cup	campaign	.
let	's	listen	to	this	song	that	coke	created	for	it	,	``	wavin	'	flag	``	by	a	somali	hip	hop	artist	.
k'naan	:	♫	oh	oh	oh	oh	oh	o	-	oh	♫	♫	oh	oh	oh	oh	oh	oh	oh	oh	oh	oh	♫	♫	oh	oh	oh	oh	oh	o	-	oh	♫	♫	oh	oh	oh	oh	oh	oh	oh	oh	o	-	oh	♫	♫give	you	freedom	,	give	you	fire♫	♫	give	you	reason	,	take	you	higher	♫	♫	see	the	champions	take	the	field	now	♫	♫	you	define	us	,	make	us	feel	proud	♫	♫	in	the	streets	our	heads	are	lifted	♫	♫	as	we	lose	our	inhibition	♫	♫	celebration	,	it	's	around	us	♫	♫	every	nation	,	all	around	us	♫	melinda	french	gates	:	it	feels	pretty	good	,	right	?
well	,	they	did	n't	stop	there	--	they	localized	it	into	18	different	languages	.
and	it	went	number	one	on	the	pop	chart	in	17	countries	.
it	reminds	me	of	a	song	that	i	remember	from	my	childhood	,	``	i	'd	like	to	teach	the	world	to	sing	,	``	that	also	went	number	one	on	the	pop	charts	.
both	songs	have	something	in	common	:	that	same	appeal	of	celebration	and	unity	.
so	how	does	health	and	development	market	?
well	,	it	's	based	on	avoidance	,	not	aspirations	.
i	'm	sure	you	've	heard	some	of	these	messages	.
``	use	a	condom	,	do	n't	get	aids	.	``
``	wash	you	hands	,	you	might	not	get	diarrhea	.	``
it	does	n't	sound	anything	like	``	wavin	'	flag	``	to	me	.
and	i	think	we	make	a	fundamental	mistake	--	we	make	an	assumption	,	that	we	think	that	,	if	people	need	something	,	we	do	n't	have	to	make	them	want	that	.
and	i	think	that	's	a	mistake	.
and	there	's	some	indications	around	the	world	that	this	is	starting	to	change	.
one	example	is	sanitation	.
we	know	that	a	million	and	a	half	children	die	a	year	from	diarrhea	and	a	lot	of	it	is	because	of	open	defecation	.
but	there	's	a	solution	:	you	build	a	toilet	.
but	what	we	're	finding	around	the	world	,	over	and	over	again	,	is	,	if	you	build	a	toilet	and	you	leave	it	there	,	it	does	n't	get	used	.
people	reuse	it	for	a	slab	for	their	home	.
they	sometimes	store	grain	in	it	.
i	've	even	seen	it	used	for	a	chicken	coop	.
but	what	does	marketing	really	entail	that	would	make	a	sanitation	solution	get	a	result	in	diarrhea	?
well	,	you	work	with	the	community	.
you	start	to	talk	to	them	about	why	open	defecation	is	something	that	should	n't	be	done	in	the	village	,	and	they	agree	to	that	.
but	then	you	take	the	toilet	and	you	position	it	as	a	modern	,	trendy	convenience	.
one	state	in	northern	india	has	gone	so	far	as	to	link	toilets	to	courtship	.
and	it	works	--	look	at	these	headlines	.
i	'm	not	kidding	.
women	are	refusing	to	marry	men	without	toilets	.
no	loo	,	no	``	i	do	.	``
now	,	it	's	not	just	a	funny	headline	--	it	's	innovative	.	it	's	an	innovative	marketing	campaign	.
but	more	importantly	,	it	saves	lives	.
take	a	look	at	this	--	this	is	a	room	full	of	young	men	and	my	husband	,	bill	.
and	can	you	guess	what	the	young	men	are	waiting	for	?
they	're	waiting	to	be	circumcised	.
can	you	you	believe	that	?
we	know	that	circumcision	reduces	hiv	infection	by	60	percent	in	men	.
and	when	we	first	heard	this	result	inside	the	foundation	,	i	have	to	admit	,	bill	and	i	were	scratching	our	heads	a	little	bit	and	we	were	saying	,	``	but	who	's	going	to	volunteer	for	this	procedure	?	``
but	it	turns	out	the	men	do	,	because	they	're	hearing	from	their	girlfriends	that	they	prefer	it	,	and	the	men	also	believe	it	improves	their	sex	life	.
so	if	we	can	start	to	understand	what	people	really	want	in	health	and	development	,	we	can	change	communities	and	we	can	change	whole	nations	.
well	,	why	is	all	of	this	so	important	?
so	let	's	talk	about	what	happens	when	this	all	comes	together	,	when	you	tie	the	three	things	together	.
and	polio	,	i	think	,	is	one	of	the	most	powerful	examples	.
we	've	seen	a	99	percent	reduction	in	polio	in	20	years	.
so	if	you	look	back	to	1988	,	there	are	about	350,000	cases	of	polio	on	the	planet	that	year	.
in	2009	,	we	're	down	to	1,600	cases	.
well	how	did	that	happen	?
let	's	look	at	a	country	like	india	.
they	have	over	a	billion	people	in	this	country	,	but	they	have	35,000	local	doctors	who	report	paralysis	,	and	clinicians	,	a	huge	reporting	system	in	chemists	.
they	have	two	and	a	half	million	vaccinators	.
but	let	me	make	the	story	a	little	bit	more	concrete	for	you	.
let	me	tell	you	the	story	of	shriram	,	an	18	month	boy	in	bihar	,	a	northern	state	in	india	.
this	year	on	august	8th	,	he	felt	paralysis	and	on	the	13th	,	his	parents	took	him	to	the	doctor	.
on	august	14th	and	15th	,	they	took	a	stool	sample	,	and	by	the	25th	of	august	,	it	was	confirmed	he	had	type	1	polio	.
by	august	30th	,	a	genetic	test	was	done	,	and	we	knew	what	strain	of	polio	shriram	had	.
now	it	could	have	come	from	one	of	two	places	.
it	could	have	come	from	nepal	,	just	to	the	north	,	across	the	border	,	or	from	jharkhand	,	a	state	just	to	the	south	.
luckily	,	the	genetic	testing	proved	that	,	in	fact	,	this	strand	came	north	,	because	,	had	it	come	from	the	south	,	it	would	have	had	a	much	wider	impact	in	terms	of	transmission	.
so	many	more	people	would	have	been	affected	.
so	what	's	the	endgame	?
well	on	september	4th	,	there	was	a	huge	mop	-	up	campaign	,	which	is	what	you	do	in	polio	.
they	went	out	and	where	shriram	lives	,	they	vaccinated	two	million	people	.
so	in	less	than	a	month	,	we	went	from	one	case	of	paralysis	to	a	targeted	vaccination	program	.
and	i	'm	happy	to	say	only	one	other	person	in	that	area	got	polio	.
that	's	how	you	keep	a	huge	outbreak	from	spreading	,	and	it	shows	what	can	happen	when	local	people	have	the	data	in	their	hands	;	they	can	save	lives	.
now	one	of	the	challenges	in	polio	,	still	,	is	marketing	,	but	it	might	not	be	what	you	think	.
it	's	not	the	marketing	on	the	ground	.
it	's	not	telling	the	parents	,	``	if	you	see	paralysis	,	take	your	child	to	the	doctor	or	get	your	child	vaccinated	.	``
we	have	a	problem	with	marketing	in	the	donor	community	.
the	g	8	nations	have	been	incredibly	generous	on	polio	over	the	last	20	years	,	but	we	're	starting	to	have	something	called	polio	fatigue	and	that	is	that	the	donor	nations	are	n't	willing	to	fund	polio	any	longer	.
so	by	next	summer	,	we	're	sighted	to	run	out	of	money	on	polio	.
so	we	are	99	percent	of	the	way	there	on	this	goal	and	we	're	about	to	run	short	of	money	.
and	i	think	that	if	the	marketing	were	more	aspirational	,	if	we	could	focus	as	a	community	on	how	far	we	've	come	and	how	amazing	it	would	be	to	eradicate	this	disease	,	we	could	put	polio	fatigue	and	polio	behind	us	.
and	if	we	could	do	that	,	we	could	stop	vaccinating	everybody	,	worldwide	,	in	all	of	our	countries	for	polio	.
and	it	would	only	be	the	second	disease	ever	wiped	off	the	face	of	the	planet	.
and	we	are	so	close	.
and	this	victory	is	so	possible	.
so	if	coke	's	marketers	came	to	me	and	asked	me	to	define	happiness	,	i	'd	say	my	vision	of	happiness	is	a	mother	holding	healthy	baby	in	her	arms	.
to	me	,	that	is	deep	happiness	.
and	so	if	we	can	learn	lessons	from	the	innovators	in	every	sector	,	then	in	the	future	we	make	together	,	that	happiness	can	be	just	as	ubiquitous	as	coca	-	cola	.
thank	you	.
