it	's	amazing	,	when	you	meet	a	head	of	state	and	you	say	,	``	what	is	your	most	precious	natural	resource	?	``	--	they	will	not	say	children	at	first	.
and	then	when	you	say	children	,	they	will	pretty	quickly	agree	with	you	.
:	we	're	traveling	today	with	the	minister	of	defense	of	colombia	,	head	of	the	army	and	the	head	of	the	police	,	and	we	're	dropping	off	650	laptops	today	to	children	who	have	no	television	,	no	telephone	and	have	been	in	a	community	cut	off	from	the	rest	of	the	world	for	the	past	40	years	.
the	importance	of	delivering	laptops	to	this	region	is	connecting	kids	who	have	otherwise	been	unconnected	because	of	the	farc	,	the	guerrillas	that	started	off	40	years	ago	as	a	political	movement	and	then	became	a	drug	movement	.
there	are	one	billion	children	in	the	world	,	and	50	percent	of	them	do	n't	have	electricity	at	home	or	at	school	.
and	in	some	countries	--	let	me	pick	afghanistan	--	75	percent	of	the	little	girls	do	n't	go	to	school	.
and	i	do	n't	mean	that	they	drop	out	of	school	in	the	third	or	fourth	grade	--	they	do	n't	go	.
so	in	the	three	years	since	i	talked	at	ted	and	showed	a	prototype	,	it	's	gone	from	an	idea	to	a	real	laptop	.
we	have	half	a	million	laptops	today	in	the	hands	of	children	.
we	have	about	a	quarter	of	a	million	in	transit	to	those	and	other	children	,	and	then	there	are	another	quarter	of	a	million	more	that	are	being	ordered	at	this	moment	.
so	,	in	rough	numbers	,	there	are	a	million	laptops	.
that	's	smaller	than	i	predicted	--	i	predicted	three	to	10	million	--	but	is	still	a	very	large	number	.
in	colombia	,	we	have	about	3,000	laptops	.
it	's	the	minister	of	defense	with	whom	we	're	working	,	not	the	minister	of	education	,	because	it	is	seen	as	a	strategic	defense	issue	in	the	sense	of	liberating	these	zones	that	had	been	completely	closed	off	,	in	which	the	people	who	had	been	causing	,	if	you	will	,	40	years	'	worth	of	bombings	and	kidnappings	and	assassinations	lived	.
and	suddenly	,	the	kids	have	connected	laptops	.
they	've	leapfrogged	.
the	change	is	absolutely	monumental	,	because	it	's	not	just	opening	it	up	,	but	it	's	opening	it	up	to	the	rest	of	the	world	.
so	yes	,	they	're	building	roads	,	yes	,	they	're	putting	in	telephone	,	yes	,	there	will	be	television	.
but	the	kids	six	to	12	years	old	are	surfing	the	internet	in	spanish	and	in	local	languages	,	so	the	children	grow	up	with	access	to	information	,	with	a	window	into	the	rest	of	the	world	.
before	,	they	were	closed	off	.
interestingly	enough	,	in	other	countries	,	it	will	be	the	minister	of	finance	who	sees	it	as	an	engine	of	economic	growth	.
and	that	engine	is	going	to	see	the	results	in	20	years	.
it	's	not	going	to	happen	,	you	know	,	in	one	year	,	but	it	's	an	important	,	deeply	economic	and	cultural	change	that	happens	through	children	.
thirty	-	one	countries	in	total	are	involved	,	and	in	the	case	of	uruguay	,	half	the	children	already	have	them	,	and	by	the	middle	of	2009	,	every	single	child	in	uruguay	will	have	a	laptop	--	a	little	green	laptop	.
now	what	are	some	of	the	results	?
some	of	the	results	that	go	across	every	single	country	include	teachers	saying	they	have	never	loved	teaching	so	much	,	and	reading	comprehension	measured	by	third	parties	--	not	by	us	--	skyrockets	.
probably	the	most	important	thing	we	see	is	children	teaching	parents	.
they	own	the	laptops	.	they	take	them	home	.
and	so	when	i	met	with	three	children	from	the	schools	,	who	had	traveled	all	day	to	come	to	bogota	,	one	of	the	three	children	brought	her	mother	.
and	the	reason	she	brought	her	mother	is	that	this	six	-	year	-	old	child	had	been	teaching	her	mother	how	to	read	and	write	.
her	mother	had	not	gone	to	primary	school	.
and	this	is	such	an	inversion	,	and	such	a	wonderful	example	of	children	being	the	agents	of	change	.
so	now	,	in	closing	,	people	say	,	now	why	laptops	?
laptops	are	a	luxury	;	it	's	like	giving	them	ipods	.	no	.
the	reason	you	want	laptops	is	that	the	word	is	education	,	not	laptop	.
this	is	an	education	project	,	not	a	laptop	project	.
they	need	to	learn	learning	.	and	then	,	just	think	--	they	can	have	,	let	's	say	,	100	books	.
in	a	village	,	you	have	100	laptops	,	each	with	a	different	set	of	100	books	,	and	so	that	village	suddenly	has	10,000	books	.
you	and	i	did	n't	have	10,000	books	when	we	went	to	primary	school	.
sometimes	school	is	under	a	tree	,	or	in	many	cases	,	the	teacher	has	only	a	fifth	-	grade	education	,	so	you	need	a	collaborative	model	of	learning	,	not	just	building	more	schools	and	training	more	teachers	,	which	you	have	to	do	anyway	.
so	we	're	once	again	doing	``	give	one	,	get	one	.	``
last	year	,	we	ran	a	``	give	one	,	get	one	``	program	,	and	it	generated	over	100,000	laptops	that	we	were	then	able	to	give	free	.
and	by	being	a	zero	-	dollar	laptop	,	we	can	go	to	countries	that	ca	n't	afford	it	at	all	.
and	that	's	what	we	did	.	we	went	to	haiti	,	we	went	to	rwanda	,	afghanistan	,	places	that	are	not	markets	,	seeding	it	with	the	principles	of	saturation	,	connectivity	,	low	ages	,	etc	.
and	then	we	can	actually	roll	out	large	numbers	.
so	think	of	it	this	way	:	think	of	it	as	inoculating	children	against	ignorance	.
and	think	of	the	laptop	as	a	vaccine	.
you	do	n't	vaccinate	a	few	children	.
you	vaccinate	all	the	children	in	an	area	.
