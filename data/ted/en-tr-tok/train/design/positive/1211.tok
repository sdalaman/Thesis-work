so	the	type	of	magic	i	like	,	and	i	'm	a	magician	,	is	a	magic	that	uses	technology	to	create	illusions	.
so	i	would	like	to	show	you	something	i	've	been	working	on	.
it	's	an	application	that	i	think	will	be	useful	for	artists	--	multimedia	artists	in	particular	.
it	synchronizes	videos	across	multiple	screens	of	mobile	devices	.
and	i	borrowed	these	three	ipods	from	people	here	in	the	audience	to	show	you	what	i	mean	.
and	i	'm	going	to	use	them	to	tell	you	a	little	bit	about	my	favorite	subject	:	deception	.
one	of	my	favorite	magicians	is	karl	germain	.
he	had	this	wonderful	trick	where	a	rosebush	would	bloom	right	in	front	of	your	eyes	.
but	it	was	his	production	of	a	butterfly	that	was	the	most	beautiful	.
announcer	:	ladies	and	gentlemen	,	the	creation	of	life	.
marco	tempest	:	when	asked	about	deception	,	he	said	this	:	announcer	:	magic	is	the	only	honest	profession	.
a	magician	promises	to	deceive	you	--	and	he	does	.
mt	:	i	like	to	think	of	myself	as	an	honest	magician	.
i	use	a	lot	of	tricks	,	which	means	that	sometimes	i	have	to	lie	to	you	.
now	i	feel	bad	about	that	.
but	people	lie	every	day	.
hold	on	.
girl	in	phone	:	hey	,	where	are	you	?
mt	:	stuck	in	traffic	.	i	'll	be	there	soon	.
you	've	all	done	it	.
lady	:	i	'll	be	ready	in	just	a	minute	,	darling	.
man	:	it	's	just	what	i	've	always	wanted	.
woman	:	you	were	great	.
mt	:	deception	,	it	's	a	fundamental	part	of	life	.
now	polls	show	that	men	tell	twice	as	many	lies	as	women	--	assuming	the	women	they	ask	told	the	truth	.
we	deceive	to	gain	advantage	and	to	hide	our	weaknesses	.
the	chinese	general	sun	tzu	said	that	all	war	was	based	on	deception	.
oscar	wilde	said	the	same	thing	of	romance	.
some	people	deceive	for	money	.
let	's	play	a	game	.
three	cards	,	three	chances	.
announcer	:	one	five	will	get	you	10	,	10	will	get	you	20	.
now	where	's	the	lady	?
where	is	the	queen	?
mt	:	this	one	?
sorry	.	you	lose	.
well	,	i	did	n't	deceive	you	.
you	deceived	yourself	.
self	-	deception	.
that	's	when	we	convince	ourselves	that	a	lie	is	the	truth	.
sometimes	it	's	hard	to	tell	the	two	apart	.
compulsive	gamblers	are	experts	at	self	-	deception	.
they	believe	they	can	win	.
they	forget	the	times	they	lose	.
the	brain	is	very	good	at	forgetting	.
bad	experiences	are	quickly	forgotten	.
bad	experiences	quickly	disappear	.
which	is	why	in	this	vast	and	lonely	cosmos	,	we	are	so	wonderfully	optimistic	.
our	self	-	deception	becomes	a	positive	illusion	--	why	movies	are	able	to	take	us	onto	extraordinary	adventures	;	why	we	believe	romeo	when	he	says	he	loves	juliet	;	and	why	single	notes	of	music	,	when	played	together	,	become	a	sonata	and	conjure	up	meaning	.
that	's	``	clair	de	lune	.	``
its	composer	called	debussy	said	that	art	was	the	greatest	deception	of	all	.
art	is	a	deception	that	creates	real	emotions	--	a	lie	that	creates	a	truth	.
and	when	you	give	yourself	over	to	that	deception	,	it	becomes	magic	.
thank	you	.	thank	you	very	much	.
