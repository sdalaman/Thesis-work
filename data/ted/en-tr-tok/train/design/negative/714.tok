so	,	now	,	there	are	a	lot	of	web	2.0	consultants	who	make	a	lot	of	money	.
in	fact	,	they	make	their	livings	on	this	kind	of	stuff	.
i	'm	going	to	try	and	save	you	all	the	time	and	all	the	money	and	go	through	it	in	the	next	three	minutes	,	so	bear	with	me	.
started	a	website	back	in	2005	,	with	a	few	friends	of	mine	,	called	reddit.com	.
that	's	what	you	'd	call	a	social	news	website	.
basically	all	that	means	is	that	the	democratic	front	page	is	the	best	stuff	on	the	web	.	you	find	some	interesting	content	,	say	a	tedtalk	,	submit	it	to	reddit	,	and	the	community	of	your	peers	will	vote	it	up	if	they	like	it	,	vote	it	down	if	they	do	n't	.
and	that	creates	the	front	page	.	it	's	always	rising	,	falling	,	always	changing	.
about	a	half	million	people	visit	every	day	.	but	this	is	n't	about	reddit	.
this	is	actually	about	discovering	new	things	that	pop	up	on	the	web	.
because	in	the	last	four	years	we	've	seen	all	kinds	of	memes	,	all	kinds	of	trends	get	born	right	on	our	front	page	.
but	this	is	n't	even	about	reddit	itself	.
it	's	actually	about	humpback	whales	.
well	,	okay	,	technically	it	's	actually	about	greenpeace	,	which	is	an	environmental	organization	that	wanted	to	stop	the	japanese	government	on	their	whaling	campaign	.
these	humpback	whales	were	getting	killed	.
they	wanted	to	put	an	end	to	it	.	and	one	of	the	ways	they	wanted	to	do	it	was	to	put	a	tracking	chip	inside	one	of	these	humpback	whales	.
but	to	really	kind	of	personify	the	movement	,	they	wanted	to	name	it	.
so	,	in	true	web	fashion	they	put	together	a	poll	where	they	had	a	bunch	of	very	erudite	,	very	thoughtful	,	cultured	names	.
i	believe	this	is	a	farsi	word	for	``	immortal	.	``
i	think	this	means	``	divine	power	of	the	ocean	``	in	a	polynesian	language	.
and	then	there	was	this	:	mister	splashy	pants	.
and	this	,	this	was	special	.	mister	pants	,	or	splashy	,	to	his	friends	,	was	very	popular	on	the	internet	.
in	fact	,	someone	on	reddit	thought	,	``	oh	,	what	a	great	thing	,	we	should	all	vote	this	up	.	``
and	,	you	know	,	redditors	responded	and	all	agreed	.
so	,	the	voting	started	and	we	actually	got	behind	it	ourselves	.
we	changed	our	logo	,	for	the	day	,	from	the	alien	to	a	splashy	,	to	sort	of	help	the	cause	.
and	it	was	n't	long	before	other	sites	like	fark	and	boing	boing	and	the	rest	of	the	internet	started	saying	,	``	yes	!	we	love	splashy	pants	.	``
so	,	it	went	from	about	five	percent	,	which	was	when	this	meme	started	,	to	70	percent	at	the	end	of	voting	.
which	is	pretty	impressive	right	?	we	won	!	mister	splashy	pants	was	chosen	.	hmm	,	just	kidding	.	okay	.
so	,	greenpeace	actually	was	n't	that	crazy	about	it	,	because	they	wanted	one	of	their	more	thoughtful	names	to	win	.
so	they	said	,	``	no	,	no	,	just	kidding	.	we	'll	give	it	another	week	of	voting	.	``
well	,	that	got	us	a	little	angry	.
so	,	we	changed	it	to	fightin	'	splashy	.
and	the	reddit	community	,	really	,	and	the	rest	of	the	internet	,	rather	,	really	got	behind	this	.
facebook	groups	were	getting	created	.	facebook	applications	were	getting	created	.
the	idea	was	,	``	vote	your	conscience	,	``	vote	for	mister	splashy	pants	.
and	people	were	putting	up	signs	in	the	real	world	--	--	about	this	whale	.
and	this	was	the	final	vote	.	when	all	was	cleared	...
78	percent	of	the	votes	,	and	to	give	you	an	idea	of	the	landslide	,	the	next	highest	name	pulled	in	three	.	okay	?
so	,	there	was	a	clear	lesson	here	.
and	that	was	that	the	internet	loves	mister	splashy	pants	.
which	is	obvious	.	it	's	a	great	name	.
everyone	wants	to	hear	their	news	anchor	say	,	``	mister	splashy	pants	.	``
and	i	think	that	's	what	helped	drive	this	.
but	what	was	cool	was	that	the	repercussions	now	for	greenpeace	was	,	they	created	an	entire	marketing	campaign	around	it	.
they	sell	mister	splashy	pants	shirts	and	pins	.
they	even	created	an	e-card	so	you	could	send	your	friend	a	dancing	splashy	.
but	what	was	even	more	important	was	the	fact	that	they	actually	accomplished	their	mission	.	the	japanese	government	called	off	their	whaling	expedition	.	mission	accomplished	.
greenpeace	was	thrilled	.	the	whales	were	happy	.	that	's	a	quote	.
and	actually	,	redditors	in	the	internet	community	were	happy	to	participate	,	but	they	were	n't	whale	lovers	.
a	few	of	them	certainly	were	.	but	we	're	talking	about	a	lot	of	people	who	were	just	really	interested	and	really	caught	up	in	this	great	meme	,	and	in	fact	someone	from	greenpeace	came	back	on	the	site	and	thanked	reddit	for	its	participation	.
but	this	was	n't	really	out	of	altruism	.	this	was	just	out	of	interest	in	doing	something	cool	.
and	this	is	kind	of	how	the	internet	works	.
this	is	that	great	big	secret	.	because	the	internet	provides	this	level	playing	field	.
your	link	is	just	as	good	as	your	link	,	which	is	just	as	good	as	my	link	.	as	long	as	we	have	a	browser	,	anyone	can	get	to	any	website	no	matter	how	big	a	budget	you	have	.
that	is	,	as	long	as	you	can	keep	net	neutrality	in	place	.
the	other	important	thing	is	that	it	costs	nothing	to	get	that	content	online	now	.
there	are	so	many	great	publishing	tools	that	are	available	,	it	only	takes	a	few	minutes	of	your	time	now	to	actually	produce	something	.
and	the	cost	of	iteration	is	so	cheap	that	you	might	as	well	give	it	a	go	.
and	if	you	do	,	be	genuine	about	it	.	be	honest	.	be	up	front	.
and	one	of	the	great	lessons	that	greenpeace	actually	learned	was	that	it	's	okay	to	lose	control	.
it	's	okay	to	take	yourself	a	little	less	seriously	,	given	that	,	even	though	it	's	a	very	serious	cause	,	you	could	ultimately	achieve	your	final	goal	.
and	that	's	the	final	message	that	i	want	to	share	with	all	of	you	--	that	you	can	do	well	online	.
but	no	longer	is	the	message	going	to	be	coming	from	just	the	top	down	.
if	you	want	to	succeed	you	've	got	to	be	okay	to	just	lose	control	.
thank	you	.
