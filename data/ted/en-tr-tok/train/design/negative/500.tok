i	thought	i	would	read	poems	i	have	that	relate	to	the	subject	of	youth	and	age	.
i	was	sort	of	astonished	to	find	out	how	many	i	have	actually	.
the	first	one	is	dedicated	to	spencer	,	and	his	grandmother	,	who	was	shocked	by	his	work	.
my	poem	is	called	``	dirt	.	``
my	grandmother	is	washing	my	mouth	out	with	soap	;	half	a	long	century	gone	and	still	she	comes	at	me	with	that	thick	cruel	yellow	bar	.
all	because	of	a	word	i	said	,	not	even	said	really	,	only	repeated	.
but	``	open	,	``	she	says	,	``	open	up	!	``
her	hand	clawing	at	my	head	.
i	know	now	her	life	was	hard	;	she	lost	three	children	as	babies	,	then	her	husband	died	too	,	leaving	young	sons	,	and	no	money	.
she	'd	stand	me	in	the	sink	to	pee	because	there	was	never	room	in	the	toilet	.
but	oh	,	her	soap	!
might	its	bitter	burning	have	been	what	made	me	a	poet	?
the	street	she	lived	on	was	unpaved	,	her	flat	,	two	cramped	rooms	and	a	fetid	kitchen	where	she	stalked	and	caught	me	.
dare	i	admit	that	after	she	did	it	i	never	really	loved	her	again	?
she	lived	to	a	hundred	,	even	then	.	all	along	it	was	the	sadness	,	the	squalor	,	but	i	never	,	until	now	loved	her	again	.
when	that	was	published	in	a	magazine	i	got	an	irate	letter	from	my	uncle	.
``	you	have	maligned	a	great	woman	.	``
it	took	some	diplomacy	.
this	is	called	``	the	dress	.	``
it	's	a	longer	poem	.
in	those	days	,	those	days	which	exist	for	me	only	as	the	most	elusive	memory	now	,	when	often	the	first	sound	you	'd	hear	in	the	morning	would	be	a	storm	of	birdsong	,	then	the	soft	clop	of	the	hooves	of	the	horse	hauling	a	milk	wagon	down	your	block	,	and	the	last	sound	at	night	as	likely	as	not	would	be	your	father	pulling	up	in	his	car	,	having	worked	late	again	,	always	late	,	and	going	heavily	down	to	the	cellar	,	to	the	furnace	,	to	shake	out	the	ashes	and	damp	the	draft	before	he	came	upstairs	to	fall	into	bed	--	in	those	long	-	ago	days	,	women	,	my	mother	,	my	friends	'	mothers	,	our	neighbors	,	all	the	women	i	knew	--	wore	,	often	much	of	the	day	,	what	were	called	housedresses	,	cheap	,	printed	,	pulpy	,	seemingly	purposefully	shapeless	light	cotton	shifts	that	you	wore	over	your	nightgown	and	,	when	you	had	to	go	look	for	a	child	,	hang	wash	on	the	line	,	or	run	down	to	the	grocery	store	on	the	corner	,	under	a	coat	,	the	twisted	hem	of	the	nightgown	always	lank	and	yellowed	,	dangling	beneath	.
more	than	the	curlers	some	of	the	women	seemed	constantly	to	have	in	their	hair	in	preparation	for	some	great	event	--	a	ball	,	one	would	think	--	that	never	came	to	pass	;	more	than	the	way	most	women	's	faces	not	only	were	never	made	up	during	the	day	,	but	seemed	scraped	,	bleached	,	and	,	with	their	plucked	eyebrows	,	scarily	masklike	;	more	than	all	that	it	was	those	dresses	that	made	women	so	unknowable	and	forbidding	,	adepts	of	enigmas	to	which	men	could	have	no	access	,	and	boys	no	conception	.
only	later	would	i	see	the	dresses	also	as	a	proclamation	:	that	in	your	dim	kitchen	,	your	laundry	,	your	bleak	concrete	yard	,	what	you	revealed	of	yourself	was	a	fabulation	;	your	real	sensual	nature	,	veiled	in	those	sexless	vestments	,	was	utterly	your	dominion	.
in	those	days	,	one	hid	much	else	as	well	:	grown	men	did	n't	embrace	one	another	,	unless	someone	had	died	,	and	not	always	then	;	you	shook	hands	or	,	at	a	ball	game	,	thumped	your	friend	's	back	and	exchanged	blows	meant	to	be	codes	for	affection	;	once	out	of	childhood	you	'd	never	again	know	the	shock	of	your	father	's	whiskers	on	your	cheek	,	not	until	mores	at	last	had	evolved	,	and	you	could	hug	another	man	,	then	hold	on	for	a	moment	,	then	even	kiss	(	your	fathers	bristles	white	and	stiff	now	)	.
what	release	finally	,	the	embrace	:	though	we	were	wary	--	it	seemed	so	audacious	--	how	much	unspoken	joy	there	was	in	that	affirmation	of	equality	and	communion	,	no	matter	how	much	misunderstanding	and	pain	had	passed	between	you	by	then	.
we	knew	so	little	in	those	days	,	as	little	as	now	,	i	suppose	about	healing	those	hurts	:	even	the	women	,	in	their	best	dresses	,	with	beads	and	sequins	sewn	on	the	bodices	,	even	in	lipstick	and	mascara	,	their	hair	aflow	,	could	only	stand	wringing	their	hands	,	begging	for	peace	,	while	father	and	son	,	like	thugs	,	like	thieves	,	like	romans	,	simmered	and	hissed	and	hated	,	inflicting	sorrows	that	endured	,	the	worst	anyway	,	through	the	kiss	and	embrace	,	bleeding	from	brother	to	brother	,	into	the	generations	.
in	those	days	there	was	still	countryside	close	to	the	city	,	farms	,	cornfields	,	cows	;	even	not	far	from	our	building	with	its	blurred	brick	and	long	shadowy	hallway	you	could	find	tracts	with	hills	and	trees	you	could	pretend	were	mountains	and	forests	.
or	you	could	go	out	by	yourself	even	to	a	half	-	block	-	long	empty	lot	,	into	the	bushes	:	like	a	creature	of	leaves	you	'd	lurk	,	crouched	,	crawling	,	simplified	,	savage	,	alone	;	already	there	was	wanting	to	be	simpler	,	wanting	,	when	they	called	you	,	never	to	go	back	.
this	is	another	longish	one	,	about	the	old	and	the	young	.
it	actually	happened	right	at	the	time	we	met	.
part	of	the	poem	takes	place	in	space	we	shared	and	time	we	shared	.
it	's	called	``	the	neighbor	.	``
her	five	horrid	,	deformed	little	dogs	who	incessantly	yap	on	the	roof	under	my	window	.
her	cats	,	god	knows	how	many	,	who	must	piss	on	her	rugs	--	her	landing	's	a	sickening	reek	.
her	shadow	once	,	fumbling	the	chain	on	her	door	,	then	the	door	slamming	fearfully	shut	,	only	the	barking	and	the	music	--	jazz	--	filtering	as	it	does	,	day	and	night	into	the	hall	.
the	time	it	was	chris	connor	singing	``	lush	life	``	--	how	it	brought	back	my	college	sweetheart	,	my	first	real	love	,	who	--	till	i	left	her	--	played	the	same	record	.
and	head	on	my	shoulder	,	hand	on	my	thigh	,	sang	sweetly	along	,	of	regrets	and	depletions	she	was	too	young	for	,	as	i	was	too	young	,	later	,	to	believe	in	her	pain	.
it	startled	,	then	bored	,	then	repelled	me	.
my	starting	to	fancy	she	'd	ended	up	in	this	fire	-	trap	in	the	village	,	that	my	neighbor	was	her	.
my	thinking	we	'd	meet	,	recognize	one	another	,	become	friends	,	that	i	'd	accomplish	a	penance	.
my	seeing	her	,	it	was	n't	her	,	at	the	mailbox	.
gray	-	yellow	hair	,	army	pants	under	a	nightgown	,	her	turning	away	,	hiding	her	ravaged	face	in	her	hands	,	muttering	an	inappropriate	``	hi	.	``
sometimes	there	are	frightening	goings	-	on	in	the	stairwell	.
a	man	shouting	,	``	shut	up	!	``	the	dogs	frantically	snarling	,	claws	scrabbling	,	then	her	--	her	voice	hoarse	,	harsh	,	hollow	,	almost	only	a	tone	,	incoherent	,	a	note	,	a	squawk	,	bone	on	metal	,	metal	gone	molten	,	calling	them	back	,	``	come	back	darlings	,	come	back	dear	ones	.
my	sweet	angels	,	come	back	.	``
medea	she	was	,	next	time	i	saw	her	.
sorceress	,	tranced	,	ecstatic	,	stock	-	still	on	the	sidewalk	ragged	coat	hanging	agape	,	passersby	flowing	around	her	,	her	mouth	torn	suddenly	open	as	though	in	a	scream	,	silently	though	,	as	though	only	in	her	brain	or	breast	had	it	erupted	.
a	cry	so	pure	,	practiced	,	detached	,	it	had	no	need	of	a	voice	,	or	could	no	longer	bear	one	.
these	invisible	links	that	allure	,	these	transfigurations	,	even	of	anguish	,	that	hold	us	.
the	girl	,	my	old	love	,	the	last	lost	time	i	saw	her	when	she	came	to	find	me	at	a	party	,	her	drunkenly	stumbling	,	falling	,	sprawling	,	skirt	hiked	,	eyes	veined	red	,	swollen	with	tears	,	her	shame	,	her	dishonor	.
my	ignorant	,	arrogant	coarseness	,	my	secret	pride	,	my	turning	away	.
still	life	on	a	rooftop	,	dead	trees	in	barrels	,	a	bench	broken	,	dogs	,	excrement	,	sky	.
what	pathways	through	pain	,	what	junctures	of	vulnerability	,	what	crossings	and	counterings	?
too	many	lives	in	our	lives	already	,	too	many	chances	for	sorrow	,	too	many	unaccounted	-	for	pasts	.
``	behold	me	,	``	the	god	of	frenzied	,	inexhaustible	love	says	,	rising	in	bloody	splendor	,	``	behold	me	.	``
her	making	her	way	down	the	littered	vestibule	stairs	,	one	agonized	step	at	a	time	.
my	holding	the	door	.
her	crossing	the	fragmented	tiles	,	faltering	at	the	step	to	the	street	,	droning	,	not	looking	at	me	,	``	can	you	help	me	?	``
taking	my	arm	,	leaning	lightly	against	me	.
her	wavering	step	into	the	world	.
her	whispering	,	``	thanks	love	.	``	lightly	,	lightly	against	me	.
i	think	i	'll	lighten	up	a	little	.
another	,	different	kind	of	poem	of	youth	and	age	.
it	's	called	``	gas	.	``
would	n't	it	be	nice	,	i	think	,	when	the	blue	-	haired	lady	in	the	doctor	's	waiting	room	bends	over	the	magazine	table	and	farts	,	just	a	little	,	and	violently	blushes	.
would	n't	it	be	nice	if	intestinal	gas	came	embodied	in	visible	clouds	,	so	she	could	see	that	her	really	quite	inoffensive	pop	had	only	barely	grazed	my	face	before	it	drifted	away	.
besides	,	for	this	to	have	happened	now	is	a	nice	coincidence	.	because	not	an	hour	ago	,	while	we	were	on	our	walk	,	my	dog	was	startled	by	a	backfire	and	jumped	straight	up	like	a	horse	bucking	.
and	that	brought	back	to	me	the	stable	i	worked	on	weekends	when	i	was	12	,	and	a	splendid	piebald	stallion	,	who	whenever	he	was	mounted	would	buck	just	like	that	,	though	more	hugely	of	course	,	enormous	,	gleaming	,	resplendent	.
and	the	woman	,	her	face	abashedly	buried	in	her	``	elle	``	now	,	reminded	me	--	i	'd	forgotten	that	not	the	least	part	of	my	awe	consisted	of	the	fact	that	with	every	jump	he	took	the	horse	would	powerfully	fart	.
phwap	!	phwap	!	phwap	!
something	never	mentioned	in	the	dozens	of	books	about	horses	and	their	riders	i	devoured	in	those	days	.
all	that	savage	grandeur	,	the	steely	glinting	hooves	,	the	eruptions	driven	from	the	creature	's	mighty	innards	,	breath	stopped	,	heart	stopped	,	nostrils	madly	flared	,	i	did	n't	know	if	i	wanted	to	break	him	,	or	be	him	.
this	is	called	``	thirst	.	``
many	--	most	of	my	poems	actually	are	urban	poems	.	i	happen	to	be	reading	a	bunch	that	are	n't	.
``	thirst	.	``
here	was	my	relation	with	the	woman	who	lived	all	last	autumn	and	winter	,	day	and	night	,	on	a	bench	in	the	103rd	street	subway	station	,	until	finally	one	day	she	vanished	.
we	regarded	each	other	,	scrutinized	one	another	.
me	shyly	,	obliquely	,	trying	not	to	be	furtive	.
she	boldly	,	unblinkingly	,	even	pugnaciously	,	wrathfully	even	,	when	her	bottle	was	empty	.
i	was	frightened	of	her	.	i	felt	like	a	child	.
i	was	afraid	some	repressed	part	of	myself	would	go	out	of	control	,	and	i	'd	be	forever	entrapped	in	the	shocking	seethe	of	her	stench	.
not	excrement	merely	,	not	merely	surface	and	orifice	going	unwashed	,	rediffusion	of	rum	,	there	was	will	in	it	,	and	intention	,	power	and	purpose	--	a	social	,	ethical	rage	and	rebellion	--	despair	too	,	though	,	grief	,	loss	.
sometimes	i	'd	think	i	should	take	her	home	with	me	,	bathe	her	,	comfort	her	,	dress	her	.
she	would	n't	have	wanted	me	to	,	i	would	think	.
instead	,	i	'd	step	into	my	train	.
how	rich	i	would	think	,	is	the	lexicon	of	our	self	-	absolving	.
how	enduring	,	our	bland	fatal	assurance	that	reflection	is	righteousness	being	accomplished	.
the	dance	of	our	glances	,	the	clash	,	pulling	each	other	through	our	perceptual	punctures	,	then	holocaust	,	holocaust	,	host	on	host	of	ill	,	injured	presences	,	squandered	,	consumed	.
her	vigil	somewhere	i	know	continues	.
her	occupancy	,	her	absolute	,	faithful	attendance	.
the	dance	of	our	glances	,	challenge	,	abdication	,	effacement	,	the	perfume	of	our	consternation	.
this	is	a	newer	poem	,	a	brand	new	poem	.
the	title	is	``	this	happened	.	``
a	student	,	a	young	woman	in	a	fourth	-	floor	hallway	of	her	lycee	,	perched	on	the	ledge	of	an	open	window	chatting	with	friends	between	classes	;	a	teacher	passes	and	chides	her	,	``	be	careful	,	you	might	fall	,	``	almost	banteringly	chides	her	,	``	you	might	fall	,	``	and	the	young	woman	,	18	,	a	girl	really	,	though	she	would	n't	think	that	,	as	brilliant	as	she	is	,	first	in	her	class	,	and	``	beautiful	,	too	,	``	she	's	often	told	,	smiles	back	,	and	leans	into	the	open	window	,	which	would	n't	even	be	open	if	it	were	winter	--	if	it	were	winter	someone	would	have	closed	it	--	leans	into	the	window	,	farther	,	still	smiling	,	farther	and	farther	,	though	it	takes	less	time	than	this	,	really	an	instant	,	and	lets	herself	fall	.
herself	fall	.
a	casual	impulse	,	a	fancy	,	never	thought	of	until	now	,	hardly	thought	of	even	now	...
no	,	more	than	impulse	or	fancy	,	the	girl	knows	what	she	's	doing	,	the	girl	means	something	,	the	girl	means	to	mean	,	because	it	occurs	to	her	in	that	instant	,	that	beautiful	or	not	,	bright	yes	or	no	,	she	's	not	who	she	is	,	she	's	not	the	person	she	is	,	and	the	reason	,	she	suddenly	knows	,	is	that	there	's	been	so	much	premeditation	where	she	is	,	so	much	plotting	and	planning	,	there	's	hardly	a	person	where	she	is	,	or	if	there	is	,	it	's	not	her	,	or	not	wholly	her	,	it	's	a	self	inhabited	,	lived	in	by	her	,	and	seemingly	even	as	she	thinks	it	she	knows	what	's	been	missing	:	grace	,	not	premeditation	but	grace	,	a	kind	of	being	in	the	world	spontaneously	,	with	grace	.
weightfully	upon	me	was	the	world	.
weightfully	this	self	which	graced	the	world	yet	never	wholly	itself	.
weightfully	this	self	which	weighed	upon	me	,	the	release	from	which	is	what	i	desire	and	what	i	achieve	.
and	the	girl	remembers	,	in	this	infinite	instant	already	now	so	many	times	divided	,	the	sadness	she	felt	once	,	hardly	knowing	she	felt	it	,	to	merely	inhabit	herself	.
yes	,	the	girl	falls	,	absurd	to	fall	,	even	the	earth	with	its	compulsion	to	take	unto	itself	all	that	falls	must	know	that	falling	is	absurd	,	yet	the	girl	falling	is	n't	myself	,	or	she	is	myself	,	but	a	self	i	took	of	my	own	volition	unto	myself	.
forever	.	with	grace	.
this	happened	.
i	'll	read	just	one	more	.	i	do	n't	usually	say	that	.
i	like	to	just	end	.
but	i	'm	afraid	that	ricky	will	come	out	here	and	shake	his	fist	at	me	.
this	is	called	``	old	man	,	``	appropriately	enough	.
``	special	:	big	tits	,	``	says	the	advertisement	for	a	soft	-	core	magazine	on	our	neighborhood	newsstand	.
but	forget	her	breasts	.
a	lush	,	fresh	-	lipped	blond	,	skin	glowing	gold	,	sprawls	there	,	resplendent	.
60	nearly	,	yet	these	hardly	tangible	,	hardly	better	than	harlots	,	can	still	stir	me	.
maybe	a	coming	of	age	in	the	american	sensual	darkness	,	never	seeing	an	unsmudged	nipple	,	an	uncensored	vagina	,	has	left	me	forever	infected	with	an	unquenchable	lust	of	the	eye	.
always	that	erotic	murmur	,	i	'm	hardly	myself	if	i	'm	not	in	a	state	of	incipient	desire	.
god	knows	though	,	there	are	worse	twists	your	obsessions	can	take	.
last	year	in	israel	,	a	young	ultra	-	orthodox	rabbi	guiding	some	teenage	girls	through	the	shrine	of	the	shoah	forbade	them	to	look	in	one	room	.
because	there	were	images	in	it	he	said	were	licentious	.
the	display	was	a	photo	.	men	and	women	stripped	naked	,	some	trying	to	cover	their	genitals	,	others	too	frightened	to	bother	,	lined	up	in	snow	waiting	to	be	shot	and	thrown	into	a	ditch	.
the	girls	,	to	my	horror	,	averted	their	gaze	.
what	carnal	mistrust	had	their	teacher	taught	them	.
even	that	though	.	another	confession	:	once	in	a	book	on	pre	-	war	poland	,	a	studio	portrait	,	an	absolute	angel	,	an	absolute	angel	with	tormented	,	tormenting	eyes	.
i	kept	finding	myself	at	her	page	.
that	she	died	in	the	camps	made	her	--	i	did	n't	dare	wonder	why	--	more	present	,	more	precious	.
died	in	the	camps	,	that	too	people	--	or	jews	anyway	--	kept	from	their	children	back	then	.
but	it	was	like	sex	,	you	did	n't	have	to	be	told	.
sex	and	death	,	how	close	they	can	seem	.
so	constantly	conscious	now	of	death	moving	towards	me	,	sometimes	i	think	i	confound	them	.
my	wife	's	loveliness	almost	consumes	me	.
my	passion	for	her	goes	beyond	reasonable	bounds	.
when	we	make	love	,	her	holding	me	everywhere	all	around	me	,	i	'm	there	and	not	there	.
my	mind	teems	,	jumbles	of	faces	,	voices	,	impressions	,	i	live	my	life	over	,	as	though	i	were	drowning	.
then	i	am	drowning	,	in	despair	at	having	to	leave	her	,	this	,	everything	,	all	,	unbearable	,	awful	.
still	,	to	be	able	to	die	with	no	special	contrition	,	not	having	been	slaughtered	,	or	enslaved	.
and	not	having	to	know	history	's	next	mad	rage	or	regression	,	it	might	be	a	relief	.
no	.	again	,	no	.
i	do	n't	mean	that	for	a	moment	.
what	i	mean	is	the	world	holds	me	so	tightly	--	the	good	and	the	bad	--	my	own	follies	and	weakness	that	even	this	counterfeit	venus	with	her	sham	heat	,	and	her	bosom	probably	plumped	with	gel	,	so	moves	me	my	breath	catches	.
vamp	.	siren	.	seductress	.
how	much	more	she	reveals	in	her	glare	of	ink	than	she	knows	.
how	she	incarnates	our	desperate	human	need	for	regard	,	our	passion	to	live	in	beauty	,	to	be	beauty	,	to	be	cherished	by	glances	,	if	by	no	more	,	of	something	like	love	,	or	love	.
thank	you	.
