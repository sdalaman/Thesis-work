i	'm	extremely	excited	to	be	given	the	opportunity	to	come	and	speak	to	you	today	about	what	i	consider	to	be	the	biggest	stunt	on	earth	.
or	perhaps	not	quite	on	earth	.
a	parachute	jump	from	the	very	edge	of	space	.
more	about	that	a	bit	later	on	.
what	i	'd	like	to	do	first	is	take	you	through	a	very	brief	helicopter	ride	of	stunts	and	the	stunts	industry	in	the	movies	and	in	television	,	and	show	you	how	technology	has	started	to	interface	with	the	physical	skills	of	the	stunt	performer	in	a	way	that	makes	the	stunts	bigger	and	actually	makes	them	safer	than	they	've	ever	been	before	.
i	've	been	a	professional	stunt	man	for	13	years	.
i	'm	a	stunt	coordinator	.	and	as	well	as	perform	stunts	i	often	design	them	.
during	that	time	,	health	and	safety	has	become	everything	about	my	job	.
it	's	critical	now	that	when	a	car	crash	happens	it	is	n't	just	the	stunt	person	we	make	safe	,	it	's	the	crew	.
we	ca	n't	be	killing	camera	men	.	we	ca	n't	be	killing	stunt	men	.
we	ca	n't	be	killing	anybody	or	hurting	anybody	on	set	,	or	any	passerby	.	so	,	safety	is	everything	.
but	it	was	n't	always	that	way	.
in	the	old	days	of	the	silent	movies	--	harold	lloyd	here	,	hanging	famously	from	the	clock	hands	--	a	lot	of	these	guys	did	their	own	stunts	.	they	were	quite	remarkable	.
they	had	no	safety	,	no	real	technology	.
what	safety	they	had	was	very	scant	.
this	is	the	first	stunt	woman	,	rosie	venger	,	an	amazing	woman	.
you	can	see	from	the	slide	,	very	very	strong	.
she	really	paved	the	way	at	a	time	when	nobody	was	doing	stunts	,	let	alone	women	.
my	favorite	and	a	real	hero	of	mine	is	yakima	canutt	.
yakima	canutt	really	formed	the	stunt	fight	.
he	worked	with	john	wayne	and	most	of	those	old	punch	-	ups	you	see	in	the	westerns	.	yakima	was	either	there	or	he	stunt	coordinated	.
this	is	a	screen	capture	from	``	stagecoach	,	``	where	yakima	canutt	is	doing	one	of	the	most	dangerous	stunts	i	've	ever	seen	.
there	is	no	safety	,	no	back	support	,	no	pads	,	no	crash	mats	,	no	sand	pits	in	the	ground	.
that	's	one	of	the	most	dangerous	horse	stunts	,	certainly	.
talking	of	dangerous	stunts	and	bringing	things	slightly	up	to	date	,	some	of	the	most	dangerous	stunts	we	do	as	stunt	people	are	fire	stunts	.
we	could	n't	do	them	without	technology	.
these	are	particularly	dangerous	because	there	is	no	mask	on	my	face	.
they	were	done	for	a	photo	shoot	.	one	for	the	sun	newspaper	,	one	for	fhm	magazine	.
highly	dangerous	,	but	also	you	'll	notice	it	does	n't	look	as	though	i	'm	wearing	anything	underneath	the	suit	.
the	fire	suits	of	old	,	the	bulky	suits	,	the	thick	woolen	suits	,	have	been	replaced	with	modern	materials	like	nomex	or	,	more	recently	,	carbonex	--	fantastic	materials	that	enable	us	as	stunt	professionals	to	burn	for	longer	,	look	more	spectacular	,	and	in	pure	safety	.
here	's	a	bit	more	.
there	's	a	guy	with	a	flame	thrower	there	,	giving	me	what	for	.
one	of	the	things	that	a	stuntman	often	does	,	and	you	'll	see	it	every	time	in	the	big	movies	,	is	be	blown	through	the	air	.
well	,	we	used	to	use	trampettes	.	in	the	old	days	,	that	's	all	they	had	.
and	that	's	a	ramp	.	spring	off	the	thing	and	fly	through	the	air	,	and	hopefully	you	make	it	look	good	.
now	we	've	got	technology	.	this	thing	is	called	an	air	ram	.
it	's	a	frightening	piece	of	equipment	for	the	novice	stunt	performer	,	because	it	will	break	your	legs	very	,	very	quickly	if	you	land	on	it	wrong	.
having	said	that	,	it	works	with	compressed	nitrogen	.
and	that	's	in	the	up	position	.	when	you	step	on	it	,	either	by	remote	control	or	with	the	pressure	of	your	foot	,	it	will	fire	you	,	depending	on	the	gas	pressure	,	anything	from	five	feet	to	30	feet	.
i	could	,	quite	literally	,	fire	myself	into	the	gallery	.
which	i	'm	sure	you	would	n't	want	.
not	today	.
car	stunts	are	another	area	where	technology	and	engineering	advances	have	made	life	easier	for	us	,	and	safer	.
we	can	do	bigger	car	stunts	than	ever	before	now	.
being	run	over	is	never	easy	.
that	's	an	old	-	fashioned	,	hard	,	gritty	,	physical	stunt	.
but	we	have	padding	,	and	fantastic	shock	-	absorbing	things	like	sorbothane	--	the	materials	that	help	us	,	when	we	're	hit	like	this	,	not	to	hurt	ourselves	too	much	.
the	picture	in	the	bottom	right	-	hand	corner	there	is	of	some	crash	test	dummy	work	that	i	was	doing	.
showing	how	stunts	work	in	different	areas	,	really	.
and	testing	breakaway	signpost	pillars	.
a	company	makes	a	lattix	pillar	,	which	is	a	network	,	a	lattice	-	type	pillar	that	collapses	when	it	's	hit	.
the	car	on	the	left	drove	into	the	steel	pillar	.
and	you	ca	n't	see	it	from	there	,	but	the	engine	was	in	the	driver	's	lap	.
they	did	it	by	remote	control	.
i	drove	the	other	one	at	60	miles	an	hour	,	exactly	the	same	speed	,	and	clearly	walked	away	from	it	.
rolling	a	car	over	is	another	area	where	we	use	technology	.
we	used	to	have	to	drive	up	a	ramp	,	and	we	still	do	sometimes	.
but	now	we	have	a	compressed	nitrogen	cannon	.
you	can	just	see	,	underneath	the	car	,	there	is	a	black	rod	on	the	floor	by	the	wheel	of	the	other	car	.
that	's	the	piston	that	was	fired	out	of	the	floor	.
we	can	flip	lorries	,	coaches	,	buses	,	anything	over	with	a	nitrogen	cannon	with	enough	power	.
it	's	a	great	job	,	really	.
it	's	such	fun	!
you	should	hear	some	of	the	phone	conversations	that	i	have	with	people	on	my	bluetooth	in	the	shop	.
``	well	,	we	can	flip	the	bus	over	,	we	can	have	it	burst	into	flames	,	and	how	about	someone	,	you	know	,	big	explosion	.	``
and	people	are	looking	like	this	...
i	sort	of	forget	how	bizarre	some	of	those	conversations	are	.
the	next	thing	that	i	'd	like	to	show	you	is	something	that	dunlop	asked	me	to	do	earlier	this	year	with	our	channel	five	's	``	fifth	gear	show	.	``
a	loop	-	the	-	loop	,	biggest	in	the	world	.
only	one	person	had	ever	done	it	before	.
now	,	the	stuntman	solution	to	this	in	the	old	days	would	be	,	``	let	's	hit	this	as	fast	as	possible	.	60	miles	an	hour	.
let	's	just	go	for	it	.	foot	flat	to	the	floor	.	``
well	,	you	'd	die	if	you	did	that	.
we	went	to	cambridge	university	,	the	other	university	,	and	spoke	to	a	doctor	of	mechanical	engineering	there	,	a	physicist	who	taught	us	that	it	had	to	be	37	miles	an	hour	.
even	then	,	i	caught	seven	g	and	lost	a	bit	of	consciousness	on	the	way	in	.
that	's	a	long	way	to	fall	,	if	you	get	it	wrong	.	that	was	just	about	right	.
so	again	,	science	helps	us	,	and	with	the	engineering	too	--	the	modifications	to	the	car	and	the	wheel	.
high	falls	,	they	're	old	fashioned	stunts	.
what	's	interesting	about	high	falls	is	that	although	we	use	airbags	,	and	some	airbags	are	quite	advanced	,	they	're	designed	so	you	do	n't	slip	off	the	side	like	you	used	to	,	if	you	land	a	bit	wrong	.	so	,	they	're	a	much	safer	proposition	.
just	basically	though	,	it	is	a	basic	piece	of	equipment	.
it	's	a	bouncy	castle	with	slats	in	the	side	to	allow	the	air	to	escape	.
that	's	all	it	is	,	a	bouncy	castle	.
that	's	the	only	reason	we	do	it	.	see	,	it	's	all	fun	,	this	job	.
what	's	interesting	is	we	still	use	cardboard	boxes	.
they	used	to	use	cardboard	boxes	years	ago	and	we	still	use	them	.
and	that	's	interesting	because	they	are	almost	retrospective	.
they	're	great	for	catching	you	,	up	to	certain	heights	.
and	on	the	other	side	of	the	fence	,	that	physical	art	,	the	physical	performance	of	the	stuntman	,	has	interfaced	with	the	very	highest	technology	in	i.t	.	and	in	software	.
not	the	cardboard	box	,	but	the	green	screen	.
this	is	a	shot	of	``	terminator	,	``	the	movie	.
two	stunt	guys	doing	what	i	consider	to	be	a	rather	benign	stunt	.
it	's	30	feet	.	it	's	water	.	it	's	very	simple	.
with	the	green	screen	we	can	put	any	background	in	the	world	on	it	,	moving	or	still	,	and	i	can	assure	you	,	nowadays	you	ca	n't	see	the	joint	.
this	is	a	parachutist	with	another	parachutist	doing	exactly	the	same	thing	.
completely	in	the	safety	of	a	studio	,	and	yet	with	the	green	screen	we	can	have	some	moving	image	that	a	skydiver	took	,	and	put	in	the	sky	moving	and	the	clouds	whizzing	by	.
decelerator	rigs	and	wires	,	we	use	them	a	lot	.
we	fly	people	on	wires	,	like	this	.
this	guy	is	not	skydiving	.	he	's	being	flown	like	a	kite	,	or	moved	around	like	a	kite	.
and	this	is	a	guinness	world	record	attempt	.
they	asked	me	to	open	their	50th	anniversary	show	in	2004	.
and	again	,	technology	meant	that	i	could	do	the	fastest	abseil	over	100	meters	,	and	stop	within	a	couple	of	feet	of	the	ground	without	melting	the	rope	with	the	friction	,	because	of	the	alloys	i	used	in	the	descender	device	.
and	that	's	centre	point	in	london	.
we	brought	oxford	street	and	tottenham	court	road	to	a	standstill	.
helicopter	stunts	are	always	fun	,	hanging	out	of	them	,	whatever	.
and	aerial	stunts	.	no	aerial	stunt	would	be	the	same	without	skydiving	.
which	brings	us	quite	nicely	to	why	i	'm	really	here	today	:	project	space	jump	.
in	1960	,	joseph	kittenger	of	the	united	states	air	force	did	the	most	spectacular	thing	.
he	did	a	jump	from	100,000	feet	,	102,000	to	be	precise	,	and	he	did	it	to	test	high	altitude	systems	for	military	pilots	in	the	new	range	of	aircraft	that	were	going	up	to	80,000	feet	or	so	.
and	i	'd	just	like	to	show	you	a	little	footage	of	what	he	did	back	then	.
and	just	how	brave	he	was	in	1960	,	bear	in	mind	.
project	excelsior	,	it	was	called	.
there	were	three	jumps	.
they	first	dropped	some	dummies	.
so	that	's	the	balloon	,	big	gas	balloon	.
it	's	that	shape	because	the	helium	has	to	expand	.
my	balloon	will	expand	to	500	times	and	look	like	a	big	pumpkin	when	it	's	at	the	top	.
these	are	the	dummies	being	dropped	from	100,000	feet	,	and	there	is	the	camera	that	's	strapped	to	them	.
you	can	clearly	see	the	curvature	of	the	earth	at	that	kind	of	altitude	.
and	i	'm	planning	to	go	from	120,000	feet	,	which	is	about	22	miles	.
you	're	in	a	near	vacuum	in	that	environment	,	which	is	in	minus	50	degrees	.
so	it	's	an	extremely	hostile	place	to	be	.
this	is	joe	kittenger	himself	.
bear	in	mind	,	ladies	and	gents	,	this	was	1960	.
he	did	n't	know	if	he	would	live	or	die	.	this	is	an	extremely	brave	man	.
i	spoke	with	him	on	the	phone	a	few	months	ago	.
he	's	a	very	humble	and	wonderful	human	being	.
he	sent	me	an	email	,	saying	,	``	if	you	get	this	thing	off	the	ground	i	wish	you	all	the	best	.	``	and	he	signed	it	,	``	happy	landings	,	``	which	i	thought	was	quite	lovely	.
he	's	in	his	80s	and	he	lives	in	florida	.	he	's	a	tremendous	guy	.
this	is	him	in	a	pressure	suit	.
now	one	of	the	challenges	of	going	up	to	altitude	is	when	you	get	to	30,000	feet	--	it	's	great	,	is	n't	it	?	--	when	you	get	to	30,000	feet	you	can	really	only	use	oxygen	.
above	30,000	feet	up	to	nearly	50,000	feet	,	you	need	pressure	breathing	,	which	is	where	you	're	wearing	a	g	suit	.
this	is	him	in	his	old	rock	-	and	-	roll	jeans	there	,	pushing	him	in	,	those	turned	up	jeans	.
you	need	a	pressure	suit	.
you	need	a	pressure	breathing	system	with	a	g	suit	that	squeezes	you	,	that	helps	you	to	breathe	in	and	helps	you	to	exhale	.
above	50,000	feet	you	need	a	space	suit	,	a	pressure	suit	.
certainly	at	100,000	feet	no	aircraft	will	fly	.
not	even	a	jet	engine	.
it	needs	to	be	rocket	-	powered	or	one	of	these	things	,	a	great	big	gas	balloon	.
it	took	me	a	while	;	it	took	me	years	to	find	the	right	balloon	team	to	build	the	balloon	that	would	do	this	job	.
i	've	found	that	team	in	america	now	.
and	it	's	made	of	polyethylene	,	so	it	's	very	thin	.
we	will	have	two	balloons	for	each	of	my	test	jumps	,	and	two	balloons	for	the	main	jump	,	because	they	notoriously	tear	on	takeoff	.
they	're	just	so	,	so	delicate	.
this	is	the	step	off	.	he	's	written	on	that	thing	,	``	the	highest	step	in	the	world	.	``
and	what	must	that	feel	like	?
i	'm	excited	and	i	'm	scared	,	both	at	the	same	time	in	equal	measures	.
and	this	is	the	camera	that	he	had	on	him	as	he	tumbled	before	his	drogue	chute	opened	to	stabilize	him	.
a	drogue	chute	is	just	a	smaller	chute	which	helps	to	keep	your	face	down	.
you	can	just	see	them	there	,	popping	open	.
those	are	the	drogue	chutes	.	he	had	three	of	them	.
i	did	quite	a	lot	of	research	.
and	you	'll	see	in	a	second	there	,	he	comes	back	down	to	the	floor	.
now	just	to	give	you	some	perspective	of	this	balloon	,	the	little	black	dots	are	people	.
it	's	hundreds	of	feet	high	.	it	's	enormous	.
that	's	in	new	mexico	.
that	's	the	u.s.	air	force	museum	.
and	they	've	made	a	dummy	of	him	.	that	's	exactly	what	it	looked	like	.
my	gondola	will	be	more	simple	than	that	.
it	's	a	three	sided	box	,	basically	.
so	i	've	had	to	do	quite	a	lot	of	training	.
this	is	morocco	last	year	in	the	atlas	mountains	,	training	in	preparation	for	some	high	altitude	jumps	.
this	is	what	the	view	is	going	to	be	like	at	90,000	feet	for	me	.
now	you	may	think	this	is	just	a	thrill	-	seeking	trip	,	a	pleasure	ride	,	just	the	world	's	biggest	stunt	.
well	there	's	a	little	bit	more	to	it	than	that	.
trying	to	find	a	space	suit	to	do	this	has	led	me	to	an	area	of	technology	that	i	never	really	expected	when	i	set	about	doing	this	.
i	contacted	a	company	in	the	states	who	make	suits	for	nasa	.
that	's	a	current	suit	.	this	was	me	last	year	with	their	chief	engineer	.
that	suit	would	cost	me	about	a	million	and	a	half	dollars	.
and	it	weighs	300	pounds	and	you	ca	n't	skydive	in	it	.
so	i	've	been	stuck	.	for	the	past	15	years	i	've	been	trying	to	find	a	space	suit	that	would	do	this	job	,	or	someone	that	will	make	one	.
something	revolutionary	happened	a	little	while	ago	,	at	the	same	facility	.
that	's	the	prototype	of	the	parachute	.	i	've	now	had	them	custom	make	one	,	the	only	one	of	its	kind	in	the	world	.	and	that	's	the	only	suit	of	its	kind	in	the	world	.
it	was	made	by	a	russian	that	's	designed	most	of	the	suits	of	the	past	18	years	for	the	soviets	.
he	left	the	company	because	he	saw	,	as	some	other	people	in	the	space	suit	industry	,	an	emerging	market	for	space	suits	for	space	tourists	.
you	know	if	you	are	in	an	aircraft	at	30,000	feet	and	the	cabin	depressurizes	,	you	can	have	oxygen	.
if	you	're	at	100,000	feet	you	die	.
in	six	seconds	you	've	lost	consciousness	.	in	10	seconds	you	're	dead	.
your	blood	tries	to	boil	.	it	's	called	vaporization	.
the	body	swells	up	.	it	's	awful	.
and	so	we	expect	--	it	's	not	much	fun	.
we	expect	,	and	others	expect	,	that	perhaps	the	faa	,	the	caa	might	say	,	``	you	need	to	put	someone	in	a	suit	that	's	not	inflated	,	that	's	connected	to	the	aircraft	.	``
then	they	're	comfortable	,	they	have	good	vision	,	like	this	great	big	visor	.
and	then	if	the	cabin	depressurizes	while	the	aircraft	is	coming	back	down	,	in	whatever	emergency	measures	,	everyone	is	okay	.
i	would	like	to	bring	costa	on	,	if	he	's	here	,	to	show	you	the	only	one	of	its	kind	in	the	world	.
i	was	going	to	wear	it	,	but	i	thought	i	'd	get	costa	to	do	it	,	my	lovely	assistant	.
thank	you	.	he	's	very	hot	.	thank	you	,	costa	.
this	is	the	communication	headset	you	'll	see	on	lots	of	space	suits	.
it	's	a	two	-	layer	suit	.	nasa	suits	have	got	13	layers	.
this	is	a	very	lightweight	suit	.	it	weighs	about	15	pounds	.
it	's	next	to	nothing	.	especially	designed	for	me	.
it	's	a	working	prototype	.	i	will	use	it	for	all	the	jumps	.
would	you	just	give	us	a	little	twirl	,	please	,	costa	?
thank	you	very	much	.
and	it	does	n't	look	far	different	when	it	's	inflated	,	as	you	can	see	from	the	picture	down	there	.
i	've	even	skydived	in	it	in	a	wind	tunnel	,	which	means	that	i	can	practice	everything	i	need	to	practice	,	in	safety	,	before	i	ever	jump	out	of	anything	.	thanks	very	much	,	costa	.
ladies	and	gentlemen	,	that	's	just	about	it	from	me	.
the	status	of	my	mission	at	the	moment	is	it	still	needs	a	major	sponsor	.
i	'm	confident	that	we	'll	find	one	.
i	think	it	's	a	great	challenge	.
and	i	hope	that	you	will	agree	with	me	,	it	is	the	greatest	stunt	on	earth	.
thank	you	very	much	for	your	time	.
