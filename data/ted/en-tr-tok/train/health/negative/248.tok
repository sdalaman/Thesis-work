how	does	the	news	shape	the	way	we	see	the	world	?
here	's	the	world	based	on	the	way	it	looks	--	based	on	landmass	.
and	here	's	how	news	shapes	what	americans	see	.
this	map	--	--	this	map	shows	the	number	of	seconds	that	american	network	and	cable	news	organizations	dedicated	to	news	stories	,	by	country	,	in	february	of	2007	--	just	one	year	ago	.
now	,	this	was	a	month	when	north	korea	agreed	to	dismantle	its	nuclear	facilities	.
there	was	massive	flooding	in	indonesia	.
and	in	paris	,	the	ipcc	released	its	study	confirming	man	's	impact	on	global	warming	.
the	u.s.	accounted	for	79	percent	of	total	news	coverage	.
and	when	we	take	out	the	u.s.	and	look	at	the	remaining	21	percent	,	we	see	a	lot	of	iraq	--	that	's	that	big	green	thing	there	--	and	little	else	.
the	combined	coverage	of	russia	,	china	and	india	,	for	example	,	reached	just	one	percent	.
when	we	analyzed	all	the	news	stories	and	removed	just	one	story	,	here	's	how	the	world	looked	.
what	was	that	story	?	the	death	of	anna	nicole	smith	.
this	story	eclipsed	every	country	except	iraq	,	and	received	10	times	the	coverage	of	the	ipcc	report	.
and	the	cycle	continues	;	as	we	all	know	,	britney	has	loomed	pretty	large	lately	.
so	,	why	do	n't	we	hear	more	about	the	world	?
one	reason	is	that	news	networks	have	reduced	the	number	of	their	foreign	bureaus	by	half	.
aside	from	one	-	person	abc	mini	-	bureaus	in	nairobi	,	new	delhi	and	mumbai	,	there	are	no	network	news	bureaus	in	all	of	africa	,	india	or	south	america	--	places	that	are	home	to	more	than	two	billion	people	.
the	reality	is	that	covering	britney	is	cheaper	.
and	this	lack	of	global	coverage	is	all	the	more	disturbing	when	we	see	where	people	go	for	news	.
local	tv	news	looms	large	,	and	unfortunately	only	dedicates	12	percent	of	its	coverage	to	international	news	.
and	what	about	the	web	?
the	most	popular	news	sites	do	n't	do	much	better	.
last	year	,	pew	and	the	colombia	j	-	school	analyzed	the	14,000	stories	that	appeared	on	google	news	'	front	page	.
and	they	,	in	fact	,	covered	the	same	24	news	events	.
similarly	,	a	study	in	e-content	showed	that	much	of	global	news	from	u.s.	news	creators	is	recycled	stories	from	the	ap	wire	services	and	reuters	,	and	do	n't	put	things	into	a	context	that	people	can	understand	their	connection	to	it	.
so	,	if	you	put	it	all	together	,	this	could	help	explain	why	today	's	college	graduates	,	as	well	as	less	educated	americans	,	know	less	about	the	world	than	their	counterparts	did	20	years	ago	.
and	if	you	think	it	's	simply	because	we	are	not	interested	,	you	would	be	wrong	.
in	recent	years	,	americans	who	say	they	closely	follow	global	news	most	of	the	time	grew	to	over	50	percent	.
the	real	question	:	is	this	distorted	worldview	what	we	want	for	americans	in	our	increasingly	interconnected	world	?
i	know	we	can	do	better	.
and	can	we	afford	not	to	?	thank	you	.
