i	still	remember	the	day	in	school	when	our	teacher	told	us	that	the	world	population	had	become	three	billion	people	,	and	that	was	in	1960	.
i	'm	going	to	talk	now	about	how	world	population	has	changed	from	that	year	and	into	the	future	,	but	i	will	not	use	digital	technology	,	as	i	've	done	during	my	first	five	tedtalks	.
instead	,	i	have	progressed	,	and	i	am	,	today	,	launching	a	brand	new	analog	teaching	technology	that	i	picked	up	from	ikea	:	this	box	.
this	box	contains	one	billion	people	.
and	our	teacher	told	us	that	the	industrialized	world	,	1960	,	had	one	billion	people	.
in	the	developing	world	,	she	said	,	they	had	two	billion	people	.
and	they	lived	away	then	.
there	was	a	big	gap	between	the	one	billion	in	the	industrialized	world	and	the	two	billion	in	the	developing	world	.
in	the	industrialized	world	,	people	were	healthy	,	educated	,	rich	,	and	they	had	small	families	.
and	their	aspiration	was	to	buy	a	car	.
and	in	1960	,	all	swedes	were	saving	to	try	to	buy	a	volvo	like	this	.
this	was	the	economic	level	at	which	sweden	was	.
but	in	contrast	to	this	,	in	the	developing	world	,	far	away	,	the	aspiration	of	the	average	family	there	was	to	have	food	for	the	day	.
they	were	saving	to	be	able	to	buy	a	pair	of	shoes	.
there	was	an	enormous	gap	in	the	world	when	i	grew	up	.
and	this	gap	between	the	west	and	the	rest	has	created	a	mindset	of	the	world	,	which	we	still	use	linguistically	when	we	talk	about	``	the	west	``	and	``	the	developing	world	.	``
but	the	world	has	changed	,	and	it	's	overdue	to	upgrade	that	mindset	and	that	taxonomy	of	the	world	,	and	to	understand	it	.
and	that	's	what	i	'm	going	to	show	you	,	because	since	1960	what	has	happened	in	the	world	up	to	2010	is	that	a	staggering	four	billion	people	have	been	added	to	the	world	population	.
just	look	how	many	.
the	world	population	has	doubled	since	i	went	to	school	.
and	of	course	,	there	's	been	economic	growth	in	the	west	.
a	lot	of	companies	have	happened	to	grow	the	economy	,	so	the	western	population	moved	over	to	here	.
and	now	their	aspiration	is	not	only	to	have	a	car	.
now	they	want	to	have	a	holiday	on	a	very	remote	destination	and	they	want	to	fly	.
so	this	is	where	they	are	today	.
and	the	most	successful	of	the	developing	countries	,	they	have	moved	on	,	you	know	,	and	they	have	become	emerging	economies	,	we	call	them	.
they	are	now	buying	cars	.
and	what	happened	a	month	ago	was	that	the	chinese	company	,	geely	,	they	acquired	the	volvo	company	,	and	then	finally	the	swedes	understood	that	something	big	had	happened	in	the	world	.
so	there	they	are	.
and	the	tragedy	is	that	the	two	billion	over	here	that	is	struggling	for	food	and	shoes	,	they	are	still	almost	as	poor	as	they	were	50	years	ago	.
the	new	thing	is	that	we	have	the	biggest	pile	of	billions	,	the	three	billions	here	,	which	are	also	becoming	emerging	economies	,	because	they	are	quite	healthy	,	relatively	well	-	educated	,	and	they	already	also	have	two	to	three	children	per	woman	,	as	those	[	richer	also	]	have	.
and	their	aspiration	now	is	,	of	course	,	to	buy	a	bicycle	,	and	then	later	on	they	would	like	to	have	a	motorbike	also	.
but	this	is	the	world	we	have	today	,	no	longer	any	gap	.
but	the	distance	from	the	poorest	here	,	the	very	poorest	,	to	the	very	richest	over	here	is	wider	than	ever	.
but	there	is	a	continuous	world	from	walking	,	biking	,	driving	,	flying	--	there	are	people	on	all	levels	,	and	most	people	tend	to	be	somewhere	in	the	middle	.
this	is	the	new	world	we	have	today	in	2010	.
and	what	will	happen	in	the	future	?
well	,	i	'm	going	to	project	into	2050	.
i	was	in	shanghai	recently	,	and	i	listened	to	what	's	happening	in	china	,	and	it	's	pretty	sure	that	they	will	catch	up	,	just	as	japan	did	.
all	the	projections	[	say	that	]	this	one	[	billion	]	will	[	only	]	grow	with	one	to	two	or	three	percent	.
[	but	this	second	]	grows	with	seven	,	eight	percent	,	and	then	they	will	end	up	here	.
they	will	start	flying	.
and	these	lower	or	middle	income	countries	,	the	emerging	income	countries	,	they	will	also	forge	forwards	economically	.
and	if	,	but	only	if	,	we	invest	in	the	right	green	technology	--	so	that	we	can	avoid	severe	climate	change	,	and	energy	can	still	be	relatively	cheap	--	then	they	will	move	all	the	way	up	here	.
and	they	will	start	to	buy	electric	cars	.
this	is	what	we	will	find	there	.
so	what	about	the	poorest	two	billion	?
what	about	the	poorest	two	billion	here	?
will	they	move	on	?
well	,	here	population	[	growth	]	comes	in	because	there	[	among	emerging	economies	]	we	already	have	two	to	three	children	per	woman	,	family	planning	is	widely	used	,	and	population	growth	is	coming	to	an	end	.
here	[	among	the	poorest	]	,	population	is	growing	.
so	these	[	poorest	]	two	billion	will	,	in	the	next	decades	,	increase	to	three	billion	,	and	they	will	thereafter	increase	to	four	billion	.
there	is	nothing	--	but	a	nuclear	war	of	a	kind	we	've	never	seen	--	that	can	stop	this	[	growth	]	from	happening	.
because	we	already	have	this	[	growth	]	in	process	.
but	if	,	and	only	if	,	[	the	poorest	]	get	out	of	poverty	,	they	get	education	,	they	get	improved	child	survival	,	they	can	buy	a	bicycle	and	a	cell	phone	and	come	[	to	live	]	here	,	then	population	growth	will	stop	in	2050	.
we	can	not	have	people	on	this	level	looking	for	food	and	shoes	because	then	we	get	continued	population	growth	.
and	let	me	show	you	why	by	converting	back	to	the	old	-	time	digital	technology	.
here	i	have	on	the	screen	my	country	bubbles	.
every	bubble	is	a	country	.	the	size	is	population	.
the	colors	show	the	continent	.
the	yellow	on	there	is	the	americas	;	dark	blue	is	africa	;	brown	is	europe	;	green	is	the	middle	east	and	this	light	blue	is	south	asia	.
that	's	india	and	this	is	china	.	size	is	population	.
here	i	have	children	per	woman	:	two	children	,	four	children	,	six	children	,	eight	children	--	big	families	,	small	families	.
the	year	is	1960	.
and	down	here	,	child	survival	,	the	percentage	of	children	surviving	childhood	up	to	starting	school	:	60	percent	,	70	percent	,	80	percent	,	90	,	and	almost	100	percent	,	as	we	have	today	in	the	wealthiest	and	healthiest	countries	.
but	look	,	this	is	the	world	my	teacher	talked	about	in	1960	:	one	billion	western	world	here	--	high	child	-	survival	,	small	families	--	and	all	the	rest	,	the	rainbow	of	developing	countries	,	with	very	large	families	and	poor	child	survival	.
what	has	happened	?	i	start	the	world	.	here	we	go	.
can	you	see	,	as	the	years	pass	by	,	child	survival	is	increasing	?
they	get	soap	,	hygiene	,	education	,	vaccination	,	penicillin	and	then	family	planning	.	family	size	is	decreasing	.
[	when	]	they	get	up	to	90	-	percent	child	survival	,	then	families	decrease	,	and	most	of	the	arab	countries	in	the	middle	east	is	falling	down	there	[	to	small	families	]	.
look	,	bangladesh	catching	up	with	india	.
the	whole	emerging	world	joins	the	western	world	with	good	child	survival	and	small	family	size	,	but	we	still	have	the	poorest	billion	.
can	you	see	the	poorest	billion	,	those	[	two	]	boxes	i	had	over	here	?
they	are	still	up	here	.
and	they	still	have	a	child	survival	of	only	70	to	80	percent	,	meaning	that	if	you	have	six	children	born	,	there	will	be	at	least	four	who	survive	to	the	next	generation	.
and	the	population	will	double	in	one	generation	.
so	the	only	way	of	really	getting	world	population	[	growth	]	to	stop	is	to	continue	to	improve	child	survival	to	90	percent	.
that	's	why	investments	by	gates	foundation	,	unicef	and	aid	organizations	,	together	with	national	government	in	the	poorest	countries	,	are	so	good	;	because	they	are	actually	helping	us	to	reach	a	sustainable	population	size	of	the	world	.
we	can	stop	at	nine	billion	if	we	do	the	right	things	.
child	survival	is	the	new	green	.
it	's	only	by	child	survival	that	we	will	stop	population	growth	.
and	will	it	happen	?
well	,	i	'm	not	an	optimist	,	neither	am	i	a	pessimist	.
i	'm	a	very	serious	``	possibilist	.	``
it	's	a	new	category	where	we	take	emotion	apart	,	and	we	just	work	analytically	with	the	world	.
it	can	be	done	.
we	can	have	a	much	more	just	world	.
with	green	technology	and	with	investments	to	alleviate	poverty	,	and	global	governance	,	the	world	can	become	like	this	.
and	look	at	the	position	of	the	old	west	.
remember	when	this	blue	box	was	all	alone	,	leading	the	world	,	living	its	own	life	.
this	will	not	happen	[	again	]	.
the	role	of	the	old	west	in	the	new	world	is	to	become	the	foundation	of	the	modern	world	--	nothing	more	,	nothing	less	.
but	it	's	a	very	important	role	.
do	it	well	and	get	used	to	it	.
thank	you	very	much	.
