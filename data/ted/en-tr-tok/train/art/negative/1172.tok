beatjazz	is	:	1.	live	looping	,	2.	jazz	improvisation	and	3.	``	gestural	``	sound	design	.
accelerometers	on	each	hand	read	hand	position	.
the	color	of	the	lights	indicates	which	sound	i	am	playing	.
red	=	drums	,	blue	=	bass	,	green	=	chords	,	orange	=	leads	,	purple	=	pads	the	mouthpiece	consists	of	...
a	button	,	two	guitar	picks	and	lots	of	hot	glue	.
the	heads	-	up	display	is	a	smartphone	that	displays	system	parameters	.
why	?
to	atomize	music	culture	so	that	all	past	,	present	and	future	genres	can	be	studied	and	abstracted	,	live	.
and	``	beatjazzers	``	become	as	common	as	d.j	.	's	.
but	mostly	...
to	make	the	future	rather	than	wait	for	it	.
