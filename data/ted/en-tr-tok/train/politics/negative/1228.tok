i	am	a	reformed	marketer	,	and	i	now	work	in	international	development	.
in	october	,	i	spent	some	time	in	the	democratic	republic	of	congo	,	which	is	the	[	second	]	largest	country	in	africa	.
in	fact	,	it	's	as	large	as	western	europe	,	but	it	only	has	300	miles	of	paved	roads	.
the	drc	is	a	dangerous	place	.
in	the	past	10	years	,	five	million	people	have	died	due	to	a	war	in	the	east	.
but	war	is	n't	the	only	reason	that	life	is	difficult	in	the	drc	.
there	are	many	health	issues	as	well	.
in	fact	,	the	hiv	prevalence	rate	is	1.3	percent	among	adults	.
this	might	not	sound	like	a	large	number	,	but	in	a	country	with	76	million	people	,	it	means	there	are	930,000	that	are	infected	.
and	due	to	the	poor	infrastructure	,	only	25	percent	of	those	are	receiving	the	life	-	saving	drugs	that	they	need	.
which	is	why	,	in	part	,	donor	agencies	provide	condoms	at	low	or	no	cost	.
and	so	while	i	was	in	the	drc	,	i	spent	a	lot	of	time	talking	to	people	about	condoms	,	including	damien	.
damien	runs	a	hotel	outside	of	kinshasa	.
it	's	a	hotel	that	's	only	open	until	midnight	,	so	it	's	not	a	place	that	you	stay	.
but	it	is	a	place	where	sex	workers	and	their	clients	come	.
now	damien	knows	all	about	condoms	,	but	he	does	n't	sell	them	.
he	said	there	's	just	not	in	demand	.
it	's	not	surprising	,	because	only	three	percent	of	people	in	the	drc	use	condoms	.
joseph	and	christine	,	who	run	a	pharmacy	where	they	sell	a	number	of	these	condoms	,	said	despite	the	fact	that	donor	agencies	provide	them	at	low	or	no	cost	,	and	they	have	marketing	campaigns	that	go	along	with	them	,	their	customers	do	n't	buy	the	branded	versions	.
they	like	the	generics	.
and	as	a	marketer	,	i	found	that	curious	.
and	so	i	started	to	look	at	what	the	marketing	looked	like	.
and	it	turns	out	that	there	are	three	main	messages	used	by	the	donor	agencies	for	these	condoms	:	fear	,	financing	and	fidelity	.
they	name	the	condoms	things	like	vive	,	``	to	live	``	they	package	it	with	the	red	ribbon	that	reminds	us	of	hiv	,	put	it	in	boxes	that	remind	you	who	paid	for	them	,	show	pictures	of	your	wife	or	husband	and	tell	you	to	protect	them	or	to	act	prudently	.
now	these	are	not	the	kinds	of	things	that	someone	is	thinking	about	just	before	they	go	get	a	condom	.
what	is	it	that	you	think	about	just	before	you	get	a	condom	?
sex	!
and	the	private	companies	that	sell	condoms	in	these	places	,	they	understand	this	.
their	marketing	is	slightly	different	.
the	name	might	not	be	much	different	,	but	the	imagery	sure	is	.
some	brands	are	aspirational	,	and	certainly	the	packaging	is	incredibly	provocative	.
and	this	made	me	think	that	perhaps	the	donor	agencies	had	just	missed	out	on	a	key	aspect	of	marketing	:	understanding	who	's	the	audience	.
and	for	donor	agencies	,	unfortunately	,	the	audience	tends	to	be	people	that	are	n't	even	in	the	country	they	're	working	[	in	]	.
it	's	people	back	home	,	people	that	support	their	work	,	people	like	these	.
but	if	what	we	're	really	trying	to	do	is	stop	the	spread	of	hiv	,	we	need	to	think	about	the	customer	,	the	people	whose	behavior	needs	to	change	--	the	couples	,	the	young	women	,	the	young	men	--	whose	lives	depend	on	it	.
and	so	the	lesson	is	this	:	it	does	n't	really	matter	what	you	're	selling	;	you	just	have	to	think	about	who	is	your	customer	,	and	what	are	the	messages	that	are	going	to	get	them	to	change	their	behavior	.
it	might	just	save	their	lives	.
thank	you	.
