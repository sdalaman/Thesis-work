i	want	to	start	with	a	game	.
and	to	win	this	game	,	all	you	have	to	do	is	see	the	reality	that	's	in	front	of	you	as	it	really	is	.	all	right	?
so	,	we	have	two	panels	here	,	of	colored	dots	.
and	one	of	those	dots	is	the	same	in	the	two	panels	.	okay	?
and	you	have	to	tell	me	which	one	.
now	,	narrow	it	down	to	the	gray	one	,	the	green	one	and	,	say	,	the	orange	one	.
so	,	by	a	show	of	hands	--	we	'll	start	with	the	easiest	one	--	show	of	hands	:	how	many	people	think	it	's	the	gray	one	?
really	?	okay	.
how	many	people	think	it	's	the	green	one	?
and	how	many	people	think	it	's	the	orange	one	?
pretty	even	split	.
let	's	find	out	what	the	reality	is	.
here	is	the	orange	one	.
here	is	the	green	one	.
and	here	is	the	gray	one	.
so	,	for	all	of	you	who	saw	that	,	you	're	a	complete	realist	.	all	right	?
so	,	this	is	pretty	amazing	,	actually	,	is	n't	it	?
because	nearly	every	living	system	has	evolved	the	ability	to	detect	light	in	one	way	or	another	.
so	,	for	us	,	seeing	color	is	one	of	the	simplest	things	the	brain	does	.
and	yet	,	even	at	this	most	fundamental	level	,	context	is	everything	.
what	i	want	to	talk	about	is	not	that	context	is	everything	,	but	why	is	context	everything	.
because	it	's	answering	that	question	that	tells	us	not	only	why	we	see	what	we	do	,	but	who	we	are	as	individuals	,	and	who	we	are	as	a	society	.
but	first	,	we	have	to	ask	another	question	,	which	is	,	``	what	is	color	for	?	``
and	instead	of	telling	you	,	i	'll	just	show	you	.
what	you	see	here	is	a	jungle	scene	,	and	you	see	the	surfaces	according	to	the	amount	of	light	that	those	surfaces	reflect	.
now	,	can	any	of	you	see	the	predator	that	's	about	to	jump	out	at	you	?
and	if	you	have	n't	seen	it	yet	,	you	're	dead	.	right	?
can	anyone	see	it	?	anyone	?	no	?
now	,	let	's	see	the	surfaces	according	to	the	quality	of	light	that	they	reflect	.
and	now	you	see	it	.
so	,	color	enables	us	to	see	the	similarities	and	differences	between	surfaces	,	according	to	the	full	spectrum	of	light	that	they	reflect	.
but	what	you	've	just	done	is	,	in	many	respects	,	mathematically	impossible	.
why	?	because	,	as	berkeley	tells	us	,	we	have	no	direct	access	to	our	physical	world	,	other	than	through	our	senses	.
and	the	light	that	falls	onto	our	eyes	is	determined	by	multiple	things	in	the	world	--	not	only	the	color	of	objects	,	but	also	the	color	of	their	illumination	,	and	the	color	of	the	space	between	us	and	those	objects	.
you	vary	any	one	of	those	parameters	,	and	you	'll	change	the	color	of	the	light	that	falls	onto	your	eye	.
this	is	a	huge	problem	because	it	means	that	the	same	image	could	have	an	infinite	number	of	possible	real	-	world	sources	.
so	let	me	show	you	what	i	mean	.	imagine	that	this	is	the	back	of	your	eye	.
and	these	are	two	projections	from	the	world	.
they	are	identical	in	every	single	way	.
identical	in	shape	,	size	,	spectral	content	.
they	are	the	same	,	as	far	as	your	eye	is	concerned	.
and	yet	they	come	from	completely	different	sources	.
the	one	on	the	right	comes	from	a	yellow	surface	,	in	shadow	,	oriented	facing	the	left	,	viewed	through	a	pinkish	medium	.
the	one	on	the	left	comes	from	an	orange	surface	,	under	direct	light	,	facing	to	the	right	,	viewed	through	a	sort	of	a	bluish	medium	.
completely	different	meanings	,	giving	rise	to	the	exact	same	retinal	information	.
and	yet	it	's	only	the	retinal	information	that	we	get	.
so	how	on	earth	do	we	even	see	?
so	,	if	you	remember	anything	in	this	next	18	minutes	,	remember	this	:	that	the	light	that	falls	on	to	your	eye	,	sensory	information	,	is	meaningless	,	because	it	could	mean	literally	anything	.
and	what	's	true	for	sensory	information	is	true	for	information	generally	.
there	is	no	inherent	meaning	in	information	.
it	's	what	we	do	with	that	information	that	matters	.
so	,	how	do	we	see	?	well	,	we	see	by	learning	to	see	.
so	,	the	brain	evolved	the	mechanisms	for	finding	patterns	,	finding	relationships	in	information	and	associating	those	relationships	with	a	behavioral	meaning	,	a	significance	,	by	interacting	with	the	world	.
we	're	very	aware	of	this	in	the	form	of	more	cognitive	attributes	,	like	language	.
so	,	i	'm	going	to	give	you	some	letter	strings	.	and	i	want	you	to	read	them	out	for	me	,	if	you	can	.
audience	:	``	can	you	read	this	?	``
``	you	are	not	reading	this	.	``
``	what	are	you	reading	?	``
beau	lotto	:	``	what	are	you	reading	?	``	half	the	letters	are	missing	.	right	?
there	is	no	a	priori	reason	why	an	``	h	``	has	to	go	between	that	``	w	``	and	``	a.	``
but	you	put	one	there	.	why	?
because	in	the	statistics	of	your	past	experience	it	would	have	been	useful	to	do	so	.	so	you	do	so	again	.
and	yet	you	do	n't	put	a	letter	after	that	first	``	t.	``
why	?	because	it	would	n't	have	been	useful	in	the	past	.
so	you	do	n't	do	it	again	.
so	let	me	show	you	how	quickly	our	brains	can	redefine	normality	,	even	at	the	simplest	thing	the	brain	does	,	which	is	color	.
so	,	if	i	could	have	the	lights	down	up	here	.
i	want	you	to	first	notice	that	those	two	desert	scenes	are	physically	the	same	.
one	is	simply	the	flipping	of	the	other	.	okay	?
now	i	want	you	to	look	at	that	dot	between	the	green	and	the	red	.	okay	?
and	i	want	you	to	stare	at	that	dot	.	do	n't	look	anywhere	else	.
and	we	're	going	to	look	at	that	for	about	30	seconds	,	which	is	a	bit	of	a	killer	in	an	18	-	minute	talk	.
but	i	really	want	you	to	learn	.
and	i	'll	tell	you	--	do	n't	look	anywhere	else	--	and	i	'll	tell	you	what	's	happening	inside	your	head	.
your	brain	is	learning	.	and	it	's	learning	that	the	right	side	of	its	visual	field	is	under	red	illumination	;	the	left	side	of	its	visual	field	is	under	green	illumination	.
that	's	what	it	's	learning	.	okay	?
now	,	when	i	tell	you	,	i	want	you	to	look	at	the	dot	between	the	two	desert	scenes	.
so	why	do	n't	you	do	that	now	?
can	i	have	the	lights	up	again	?
i	take	it	from	your	response	they	do	n't	look	the	same	anymore	.	right	?
why	?	because	your	brain	is	seeing	that	same	information	as	if	the	right	one	is	still	under	red	light	,	and	the	left	one	is	still	under	green	light	.
that	's	your	new	normal	.
so	,	what	does	this	mean	for	context	?
it	means	that	i	can	take	these	two	identical	squares	,	and	i	can	put	them	in	light	and	dark	surrounds	.
and	now	the	one	on	the	dark	surround	looks	lighter	than	the	one	on	the	light	surround	.
what	's	significant	is	not	simply	the	light	and	dark	surrounds	that	matter	.
it	's	what	those	light	and	dark	surrounds	meant	for	your	behavior	in	the	past	.
so	i	'll	show	you	what	i	mean	.	here	we	have	that	exact	same	illusion	.
we	have	two	identical	tiles	,	on	the	left	,	one	in	a	dark	surround	,	one	in	a	light	surround	.
and	the	same	thing	over	on	the	right	.
now	,	what	i	'm	going	to	do	is	i	'm	going	to	review	those	two	scenes	.
but	i	'm	not	going	to	change	anything	within	those	boxes	,	except	their	meaning	.
and	see	what	happens	to	your	perception	.
notice	that	on	the	left	the	two	tiles	look	nearly	completely	opposite	:	one	very	white	and	one	very	dark	.
all	right	?	whereas	on	the	right	,	the	two	tiles	look	nearly	the	same	.
and	yet	there	is	still	one	on	a	dark	surround	and	one	on	a	light	surround	.
why	?	because	if	the	tile	in	that	shadow	were	in	fact	in	shadow	,	and	reflecting	the	same	amount	of	light	to	your	eye	as	the	one	outside	the	shadow	,	it	would	have	to	be	more	reflective	--	just	the	laws	of	physics	.
so	you	see	it	that	way	.
whereas	on	the	right	,	the	information	is	consistent	with	those	two	tiles	being	under	the	same	light	.
if	they	are	under	the	same	light	,	reflecting	the	same	amount	of	light	to	your	eye	,	then	they	must	be	equally	reflective	.
so	you	see	it	that	way	.
which	means	we	can	bring	all	this	information	together	to	create	some	incredibly	strong	illusions	.
this	is	one	i	made	a	few	years	ago	.
and	you	'll	notice	you	see	a	dark	brown	tile	at	the	top	,	and	a	bright	orange	tile	at	the	side	.
that	is	your	perceptual	reality	.	the	physical	reality	is	that	those	two	tiles	are	the	same	.
here	you	see	four	gray	tiles	on	your	left	,	seven	gray	tiles	on	the	right	.
i	'm	not	going	to	change	those	tiles	at	all	,	but	i	'm	going	to	reveal	the	rest	of	the	scene	and	see	what	happens	to	your	perception	.
the	four	blue	tiles	on	the	left	are	gray	.
the	seven	yellow	tiles	on	the	right	are	also	gray	.
they	are	the	same	.	okay	?
do	n't	believe	me	?	let	's	watch	it	again	.
what	's	true	for	color	is	also	true	for	complex	perceptions	of	motion	.
so	here	we	have	--	let	's	turn	this	around	--	a	diamond	.
and	what	i	'm	going	to	do	is	,	i	'm	going	to	hold	it	here	,	and	i	'm	going	to	spin	it	.
and	for	all	of	you	,	you	'll	see	it	probably	spinning	this	direction	.
now	i	want	you	to	keep	looking	at	it	.
move	your	eyes	around	,	blink	,	maybe	close	one	eye	.
and	suddenly	it	will	flip	,	and	start	spinning	the	opposite	direction	.
yes	?	raise	your	hand	if	you	got	that	.	yes	?
keep	blinking	.	every	time	you	blink	it	will	switch	.	alright	?
so	i	can	ask	you	,	which	direction	is	it	rotating	?
how	do	you	know	?
your	brain	does	n't	know	.	because	both	are	equally	likely	.
so	depending	on	where	it	looks	,	it	flips	between	the	two	possibilities	.
are	we	the	only	ones	that	see	illusions	?
the	answer	to	this	question	is	no	.
even	the	beautiful	bumblebee	,	with	its	mere	one	million	brain	cells	,	which	is	250	times	fewer	cells	than	you	have	in	one	retina	,	sees	illusions	,	does	the	most	complicated	things	that	even	our	most	sophisticated	computers	ca	n't	do	.
so	in	my	lab	,	we	of	course	work	on	bumblebees	.
because	we	can	completely	control	their	experience	,	and	see	how	that	alters	the	architecture	of	their	brain	.
and	we	do	this	in	what	we	call	the	bee	matrix	.
and	here	you	have	the	hive	.	you	can	see	the	queen	bee	,	that	large	bee	in	the	middle	there	.	those	are	all	her	daughters	,	the	eggs	.
and	they	go	back	and	forth	between	this	hive	and	the	arena	,	via	this	tube	.
and	you	'll	see	one	of	the	bees	come	out	here	.
you	see	how	she	has	a	little	number	on	her	?
yeah	there	is	another	one	coming	out	.	she	has	another	number	on	her	.
now	,	they	are	not	born	that	way	.	right	?
we	pull	them	out	,	put	them	in	the	fridge	,	and	they	fall	asleep	.
and	then	you	can	superglue	little	numbers	on	them	.
and	now	,	in	this	experiment	they	get	rewarded	if	they	go	to	the	blue	flowers	.
and	they	land	on	the	flower	.	they	stick	their	tongue	in	there	,	called	a	proboscis	,	and	they	drink	sugar	water	.
now	she	is	drinking	a	glass	of	water	that	's	about	that	big	to	you	and	i	,	will	do	that	about	three	times	,	and	then	fly	.
and	sometimes	they	learn	not	to	go	to	the	blue	,	but	to	go	to	where	the	other	bees	go	.
so	they	copy	each	other	.	they	can	count	to	five	.	they	can	recognize	faces	.
and	here	she	comes	down	the	ladder	.
and	she	'll	come	into	the	hive	,	find	an	empty	honey	pot	and	throw	up	,	and	that	's	honey	.
now	remember	--	--	she	's	supposed	to	be	going	to	the	blue	flowers	.
but	what	are	these	bees	doing	in	the	upper	right	corner	?
it	looks	like	they	're	going	to	green	flowers	.
now	,	are	they	getting	it	wrong	?
and	the	answer	to	the	question	is	no	.	those	are	actually	blue	flowers	.
but	those	are	blue	flowers	under	green	light	.
so	they	are	using	the	relationships	between	the	colors	to	solve	the	puzzle	,	which	is	exactly	what	we	do	.
so	,	illusions	are	often	used	,	especially	in	art	,	in	the	words	of	a	more	contemporary	artist	,	``	to	demonstrate	the	fragility	of	our	senses	.	``
okay	,	this	is	complete	rubbish	.
the	senses	are	n't	fragile	.	and	if	they	were	,	we	would	n't	be	here	.
instead	,	color	tells	us	something	completely	different	,	that	the	brain	did	n't	actually	evolve	to	see	the	world	the	way	it	is	.
we	ca	n't	.	instead	,	the	brain	evolved	to	see	the	world	the	way	it	was	useful	to	see	in	the	past	.
and	how	we	see	is	by	continually	redefining	normality	.
so	how	can	we	take	this	incredible	capacity	of	plasticity	of	the	brain	and	get	people	to	experience	their	world	differently	?
well	,	one	of	the	ways	we	do	in	my	lab	and	studio	is	we	translate	the	light	into	sound	and	we	enable	people	to	hear	their	visual	world	.
and	they	can	navigate	the	world	using	their	ears	.
here	is	david	,	in	the	right	.	and	he	is	holding	a	camera	.
on	the	left	is	what	his	camera	sees	.
and	you	'll	see	there	is	a	line	,	a	faint	line	going	across	that	image	.
that	line	is	broken	up	into	32	squares	.
in	each	square	we	calculate	the	average	color	.
and	then	we	just	simply	translate	that	into	sound	.
and	now	he	's	going	to	turn	around	,	close	his	eyes	,	and	find	a	plate	on	the	ground	with	his	eyes	closed	.
he	finds	it	.	amazing	.	right	?
so	not	only	can	we	create	a	prosthetic	for	the	visually	impaired	,	but	we	can	also	investigate	how	people	literally	make	sense	of	the	world	.
but	we	can	also	do	something	else	.	we	can	also	make	music	with	color	.
so	,	working	with	kids	,	they	created	images	,	thinking	about	what	might	the	images	you	see	sound	like	if	we	could	listen	to	them	.
and	then	we	translated	these	images	.
and	this	is	one	of	those	images	.
and	this	is	a	six	-	year	-	old	child	composing	a	piece	of	music	for	a	32	-	piece	orchestra	.
and	this	is	what	it	sounds	like	.
so	,	a	six	-	year	-	old	child	.	okay	?
now	,	what	does	all	this	mean	?
what	this	suggests	is	that	no	one	is	an	outside	observer	of	nature	.	okay	?
we	are	not	defined	by	our	central	properties	,	by	the	bits	that	make	us	up	.
we	're	defined	by	our	environment	and	our	interaction	with	that	environment	--	by	our	ecology	.
and	that	ecology	is	necessarily	relative	,	historical	and	empirical	.
so	what	i	'd	like	to	finish	with	is	this	over	here	.
because	what	i	've	been	trying	to	do	is	really	celebrate	uncertainty	.
because	i	think	only	through	uncertainty	is	there	potential	for	understanding	.
so	,	if	some	of	you	are	still	feeling	a	bit	too	certain	,	i	'd	like	to	do	this	one	.
so	,	if	we	have	the	lights	down	.
and	what	we	have	here	--	can	everyone	see	25	purple	surfaces	on	your	left	,	and	25	,	call	it	yellowish	,	surfaces	on	your	right	?
so	,	now	,	what	i	want	to	do	:	i	'm	going	to	put	the	middle	nine	surfaces	here	under	yellow	illumination	by	simply	putting	a	filter	behind	them	.
all	right	.	now	you	can	see	that	changes	the	light	that	's	coming	through	there	.	right	?
because	now	the	light	is	going	through	a	yellowish	filter	and	then	a	purplish	filter	.
i	'm	going	to	do	this	opposite	on	the	left	here	.
i	'm	going	to	put	the	middle	nine	under	a	purplish	light	.
now	,	some	of	you	will	notice	that	the	consequence	is	that	the	light	coming	through	those	middle	nine	on	the	right	,	or	your	left	,	is	exactly	the	same	as	the	light	coming	through	the	middle	nine	on	your	right	.
agreed	?	yes	?
okay	.	so	they	are	physically	the	same	.
let	's	pull	the	covers	off	.
now	remember	,	you	know	the	middle	nine	are	exactly	the	same	.
do	they	look	the	same	?	no	.
the	question	is	,	``	is	that	an	illusion	?	``
and	i	'll	leave	you	with	that	.
so	,	thank	you	very	much	.
