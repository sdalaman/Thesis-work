i	thought	i	'd	begin	with	a	scene	of	war	.
there	was	little	to	warn	of	the	danger	ahead	.
the	iraqi	insurgent	had	placed	the	ied	,	an	improvised	explosive	device	,	along	the	side	of	the	road	with	great	care	.
by	2006	,	there	were	more	than	2,500	of	these	attacks	every	single	month	,	and	they	were	the	leading	cause	of	casualties	among	american	soldiers	and	iraqi	civilians	.
the	team	that	was	hunting	for	this	ied	is	called	an	eod	team	--	explosives	ordinance	disposal	--	and	they	're	the	pointy	end	of	the	spear	in	the	american	effort	to	suppress	these	roadside	bombs	.
each	eod	team	goes	out	on	about	600	of	these	bomb	calls	every	year	,	_UNK_	about	two	bombs	a	day	.
perhaps	the	best	sign	of	how	valuable	they	are	to	the	war	effort	,	is	that	the	iraqi	insurgents	put	a	$	50,000	bounty	on	the	head	of	a	single	eod	soldier	.
by	the	time	the	soldier	advanced	close	enough	to	see	the	telltale	wires	of	the	bomb	,	it	exploded	in	a	wave	of	flame	.
now	,	depending	how	close	you	are	and	how	much	explosive	has	been	packed	into	that	bomb	,	it	can	cause	death	or	injury	.	you	have	to	be	as	far	as	50	yards	away	to	escape	that	.
the	blast	is	so	strong	it	can	even	break	your	limbs	,	even	if	you	're	not	hit	.
that	soldier	had	been	on	top	of	the	bomb	.
and	so	when	the	rest	of	the	team	advanced	they	found	little	left	.	and	that	night	the	unit	's	commander	did	a	sad	duty	,	and	he	wrote	a	_UNK_	letter	back	to	the	united	states	,	and	he	talked	about	how	hard	the	loss	had	been	on	his	unit	,	about	the	fact	that	they	had	lost	their	bravest	soldier	,	a	soldier	who	had	saved	their	lives	many	a	time	.
and	he	_UNK_	for	not	being	able	to	bring	them	home	.
but	then	he	talked	up	the	silver	lining	that	he	took	away	from	the	loss	.
``	at	least	,	``	as	he	wrote	,	``	when	a	robot	dies	,	you	do	n't	have	to	write	a	letter	to	its	mother	.	``
that	scene	sounds	like	science	fiction	,	but	is	battlefield	reality	already	.
the	soldier	in	that	case	was	a	42	-	pound	robot	called	a	packbot	.
the	chief	's	letter	went	,	not	to	some	_UNK_	in	iowa	like	you	see	in	the	old	war	movies	,	but	went	to	the	irobot	company	,	which	is	named	after	the	_UNK_	novel	and	the	not	-	so	-	great	will	smith	movie	,	and	...	um	...	...
if	you	remember	that	in	that	fictional	world	,	robots	started	out	carrying	out	mundane	chores	,	and	then	they	started	taking	on	life	-	and	-	death	decisions	.
that	's	a	reality	we	face	today	.
what	we	're	going	to	do	is	actually	just	flash	a	series	of	photos	behind	me	that	show	you	the	reality	of	robots	used	in	war	right	now	or	already	at	the	prototype	stage	.
it	's	just	to	give	you	a	taste	.
another	way	of	putting	it	is	you	're	not	going	to	see	anything	that	's	powered	by	vulcan	technology	,	or	teenage	wizard	hormones	or	anything	like	that	.
this	is	all	real	.	so	why	do	n't	we	go	ahead	and	start	those	pictures	.
something	big	is	going	on	in	war	today	,	and	maybe	even	the	history	of	humanity	itself	.	the	u.s.	military	went	into	iraq	with	a	handful	of	drones	in	the	air	.
we	now	have	5,300	.
we	went	in	with	zero	unmanned	ground	systems	.	we	now	have	12,000	.
and	the	tech	term	``	killer	application	``	takes	on	new	meaning	in	this	space	.
and	we	need	to	remember	that	we	're	talking	about	the	model	t	_UNK_	,	the	wright	flyers	,	compared	to	what	's	coming	soon	.
that	's	where	we	're	at	right	now	.
one	of	the	people	that	i	recently	met	with	was	an	air	force	three	-	star	general	,	and	he	said	basically	,	where	we	're	headed	very	soon	is	tens	of	thousands	of	robots	operating	in	our	conflicts	,	and	these	numbers	matter	,	because	we	're	not	just	talking	about	tens	of	thousands	of	today	's	robots	,	but	tens	of	thousands	of	these	prototypes	and	tomorrow	's	robots	,	because	of	course	,	one	of	the	things	that	's	operating	in	technology	is	moore	's	law	,	that	you	can	pack	in	more	and	more	computing	power	into	those	robots	,	and	so	flash	forward	around	25	years	,	if	moore	's	law	holds	true	,	those	robots	will	be	close	to	a	billion	times	more	powerful	in	their	computing	than	today	.
and	so	what	that	means	is	the	kind	of	things	that	we	used	to	only	talk	about	at	science	fiction	conventions	like	comic	-	con	have	to	be	talked	about	in	the	halls	of	power	and	places	like	the	pentagon	.
a	robots	revolution	is	upon	us	.
now	,	i	need	to	be	clear	here	.
i	'm	not	talking	about	a	revolution	where	you	have	to	worry	about	the	governor	of	california	showing	up	at	your	door	,	a	la	the	terminator	.
when	historians	look	at	this	period	,	they	're	going	to	conclude	that	we	're	in	a	different	type	of	revolution	:	a	revolution	in	war	,	like	the	invention	of	the	atomic	bomb	.
but	it	may	be	even	bigger	than	that	,	because	our	unmanned	systems	do	n't	just	affect	the	``	how	``	of	war	-	fighting	,	they	affect	the	``	who	``	of	fighting	at	its	most	fundamental	level	.
that	is	,	every	previous	revolution	in	war	,	be	it	the	machine	gun	,	be	it	the	atomic	bomb	,	was	about	a	system	that	either	shot	faster	,	went	further	,	had	a	bigger	boom	.
that	's	certainly	the	case	with	robotics	,	but	they	also	change	the	experience	of	the	warrior	and	even	the	very	identity	of	the	warrior	.
another	way	of	putting	this	is	that	mankind	's	5,000	-	year	-	old	monopoly	on	the	fighting	of	war	is	breaking	down	in	our	very	lifetime	.	i	've	spent	the	last	several	years	going	around	meeting	with	all	the	players	in	this	field	,	from	the	robot	scientists	to	the	science	fiction	authors	who	inspired	them	to	the	19	-	year	-	old	drone	pilots	who	are	fighting	from	nevada	,	to	the	four	-	star	generals	who	command	them	,	to	even	the	iraqi	insurgents	who	they	are	targeting	and	what	they	think	about	our	systems	,	and	what	i	found	interesting	is	not	just	their	stories	,	but	how	their	experiences	point	to	these	ripple	effects	that	are	going	outwards	in	our	society	,	in	our	law	and	our	ethics	,	etc	.	and	so	what	i	'd	like	to	do	with	my	remaining	time	is	basically	flesh	out	a	couple	of	these	.
so	the	first	is	that	the	future	of	war	,	even	a	robotics	one	,	is	not	going	to	be	purely	an	american	one	.
the	u.s.	is	currently	ahead	in	military	robotics	right	now	,	but	we	know	that	in	technology	there	's	no	such	thing	as	a	permanent	first	move	or	advantage	.
in	a	quick	show	of	hands	,	how	many	people	in	this	room	still	use	wang	computers	?
it	's	the	same	thing	in	war	.	the	british	and	the	french	invented	the	tank	.
the	germans	figured	out	how	to	use	it	right	,	and	so	what	we	have	to	think	about	for	the	u.s.	is	that	we	are	ahead	right	now	,	but	you	have	43	other	countries	out	there	working	on	military	robotics	,	and	they	include	all	the	interesting	countries	like	russia	,	china	,	pakistan	,	iran	.
and	this	raises	a	bigger	worry	for	me	.
how	do	we	move	forward	in	this	revolution	given	the	state	of	our	manufacturing	and	the	state	of	our	science	and	mathematics	training	in	our	schools	?
or	another	way	of	thinking	about	this	is	,	what	does	it	mean	to	go	to	war	increasingly	with	soldiers	whose	hardware	is	made	in	china	and	software	is	written	in	india	?
but	just	as	software	has	gone	open	-	source	,	so	has	warfare	.
unlike	an	aircraft	carrier	or	an	atomic	bomb	,	you	do	n't	need	a	massive	manufacturing	system	to	build	robotics	.	a	lot	of	it	is	off	the	shelf	.	a	lot	of	it	's	even	do	-	it	-	yourself	.
one	of	those	things	you	just	saw	flashed	before	you	was	a	_UNK_	drone	,	the	handheld	tossed	one	.	for	about	a	thousand	dollars	,	you	can	build	one	yourself	,	equivalent	to	what	the	soldiers	use	in	iraq	.
that	raises	another	wrinkle	when	it	comes	to	war	and	conflict	.	good	guys	might	play	around	and	work	on	these	as	hobby	kits	,	but	so	might	bad	guys	.
this	cross	between	robotics	and	things	like	terrorism	is	going	to	be	fascinating	and	we	've	already	seen	it	start	.
during	the	war	between	israel	,	a	state	,	and	_UNK_	,	a	non	-	state	actor	,	the	non	-	state	actor	flew	four	different	drones	against	israel	.
there	's	already	a	_UNK_	website	that	you	can	go	on	and	remotely	detonate	an	ied	in	iraq	while	sitting	at	your	home	computer	.
and	so	i	think	what	we	're	going	to	see	is	two	trends	take	place	with	this	.
first	is	,	you	're	going	to	reinforce	the	power	of	individuals	against	governments	,	but	then	the	second	is	that	we	are	going	to	see	an	expansion	in	the	realm	of	terrorism	.
the	future	of	it	may	be	a	cross	between	al	qaeda	2.0	and	the	next	generation	of	the	unabomber	.
and	another	way	of	thinking	about	this	is	the	fact	that	,	remember	,	you	do	n't	have	to	convince	a	robot	that	they	're	gon	na	receive	72	virgins	after	they	die	to	convince	them	to	blow	themselves	up	.
but	the	ripple	effects	of	this	are	going	to	go	out	into	our	politics	.	one	of	the	people	that	i	met	with	was	a	former	assistant	secretary	of	defense	for	ronald	reagan	,	and	he	put	it	this	way	:	``	i	like	these	systems	because	they	save	american	lives	,	but	i	worry	about	more	_UNK_	of	wars	,	more	shock	-	and	-	awe	talk	,	to	_UNK_	discussion	of	the	costs	.
people	are	more	likely	to	support	the	use	of	force	if	they	view	it	as	_UNK_	.	``
robots	for	me	take	certain	trends	that	are	already	in	play	in	our	body	politic	,	and	maybe	take	them	to	their	logical	ending	point	.
we	do	n't	have	a	draft	.	we	do	n't	have	declarations	of	war	anymore	.
we	do	n't	buy	war	bonds	anymore	.
and	now	we	have	the	fact	that	we	're	converting	more	and	more	of	our	american	soldiers	that	we	would	send	into	harm	's	way	into	machines	,	and	so	we	may	take	those	already	lowering	bars	to	war	and	drop	them	to	the	ground	.
but	the	future	of	war	is	also	going	to	be	that	is	,	our	new	technologies	do	n't	merely	remove	humans	from	risk	.
they	also	record	everything	that	they	see	.
so	they	do	n't	just	_UNK_	the	public	:	they	reshape	its	relationship	with	war	.
there	's	already	several	thousand	video	clips	of	combat	footage	from	iraq	on	youtube	right	now	,	most	of	it	gathered	by	drones	.
now	,	this	could	be	a	good	thing	.
it	could	be	building	connections	between	the	home	front	and	the	war	front	but	remember	,	this	is	taking	place	in	our	strange	,	weird	world	,	and	so	inevitably	the	ability	to	download	these	video	clips	to	,	you	know	,	your	ipod	or	your	_UNK_	gives	you	the	ability	to	turn	it	into	entertainment	.
soldiers	have	a	name	for	these	clips	.
they	call	it	war	porn	.
the	typical	one	that	i	was	sent	was	an	email	that	had	an	attachment	of	video	of	a	predator	strike	taking	out	an	enemy	site	.	missile	hits	,	bodies	burst	into	the	air	with	the	explosion	.
it	was	set	to	music	.
it	was	set	to	the	pop	song	``	i	just	want	to	fly	``	by	sugar	ray	.
this	ability	to	watch	more	but	experience	less	creates	a	wrinkle	in	the	public	's	relationship	with	war	.
i	think	about	this	with	a	sports	parallel	.
it	's	like	the	difference	between	watching	an	nba	game	,	a	professional	basketball	game	on	tv	,	where	the	athletes	are	tiny	figures	on	the	screen	,	and	being	at	that	basketball	game	in	person	and	realizing	what	someone	seven	feet	really	does	look	like	.
but	we	have	to	remember	,	these	are	just	the	clips	.
these	are	just	the	_UNK_	_UNK_	version	of	the	game	.	they	lose	the	context	.
they	lose	the	humanity	.	war	just	becomes	slam	_UNK_	and	smart	bombs	.
now	the	irony	of	all	this	is	that	while	the	future	of	war	may	involve	more	and	more	machines	,	it	's	our	human	psychology	that	's	driving	all	of	this	,	it	's	our	human	_UNK_	that	are	leading	to	these	wars	.
so	one	example	of	this	that	has	big	resonance	in	the	policy	realm	is	how	this	plays	out	on	our	very	real	war	of	ideas	that	we	're	fighting	what	is	the	message	that	we	think	we	are	sending	with	these	machines	versus	what	is	being	received	in	terms	of	the	message	.
so	one	of	the	people	that	i	met	was	a	senior	bush	administration	official	,	who	had	this	to	say	about	our	_UNK_	of	war	.
``	it	plays	to	our	strength	.	the	thing	that	scares	people	is	our	technology	.	``
but	when	you	go	out	and	meet	with	people	,	for	example	in	lebanon	,	it	's	a	very	different	story	.	one	of	the	people	i	met	with	there	was	a	news	editor	,	and	we	're	talking	as	a	drone	is	flying	above	him	,	and	this	is	what	he	had	to	say	.
