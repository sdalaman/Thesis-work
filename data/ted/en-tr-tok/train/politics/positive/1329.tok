i	'm	going	to	start	here	.
this	is	a	hand	-	lettered	sign	that	appeared	in	a	mom	and	pop	bakery	in	my	old	neighborhood	in	brooklyn	a	few	years	ago	.
the	store	owned	one	of	those	machines	that	can	print	on	plates	of	sugar	.
and	kids	could	bring	in	drawings	and	have	the	store	print	a	sugar	plate	for	the	top	of	their	birthday	cake	.
but	unfortunately	,	one	of	the	things	kids	liked	to	draw	was	cartoon	characters	.
they	liked	to	draw	the	little	mermaid	,	they	'd	like	to	draw	a	smurf	,	they	'd	like	to	draw	micky	mouse	.
but	it	turns	out	to	be	illegal	to	print	a	child	's	drawing	of	micky	mouse	onto	a	plate	of	sugar	.
and	it	's	a	copyright	violation	.
and	policing	copyright	violations	for	children	's	birthday	cakes	was	such	a	hassle	that	the	college	bakery	said	,	``	you	know	what	,	we	're	getting	out	of	that	business	.
if	you	're	an	amateur	,	you	do	n't	have	access	to	our	machine	anymore	.
if	you	want	a	printed	sugar	birthday	cake	,	you	have	to	use	one	of	our	prefab	images	--	only	for	professionals	.	``
so	there	's	two	bills	in	congress	right	now	.
one	is	called	sopa	,	the	other	is	called	pipa	.
sopa	stands	for	the	stop	online	piracy	act	.
it	's	from	the	senate	.
pipa	is	short	for	protectip	,	which	is	itself	short	for	preventing	real	online	threats	to	economic	creativity	and	theft	of	intellectual	property	--	because	the	congressional	aides	who	name	these	things	have	a	lot	of	time	on	their	hands	.
and	what	sopa	and	pipa	want	to	do	is	they	want	to	do	this	.
they	want	to	raise	the	cost	of	copyright	compliance	to	the	point	where	people	simply	get	out	of	the	business	of	offering	it	as	a	capability	to	amateurs	.
now	the	way	they	propose	to	do	this	is	to	identify	sites	that	are	substantially	infringing	on	copyright	--	although	how	those	sites	are	identified	is	never	fully	specified	in	the	bills	--	and	then	they	want	to	remove	them	from	the	domain	name	system	.
they	want	to	take	them	out	of	the	domain	name	system	.
now	the	domain	name	system	is	the	thing	that	turns	human	-	readable	names	,	like	google.com	,	into	the	kinds	of	addresses	machines	expect	--	74.125.226.212	.
now	the	problem	with	this	model	of	censorship	,	of	identifying	a	site	and	then	trying	to	remove	it	from	the	domain	name	system	,	is	that	it	wo	n't	work	.
and	you	'd	think	that	would	be	a	pretty	big	problem	for	a	law	,	but	congress	seems	not	to	have	let	that	bother	them	too	much	.
now	the	reason	it	wo	n't	work	is	that	you	can	still	type	74.125.226.212	into	the	browser	or	you	can	make	it	a	clickable	link	and	you	'll	still	go	to	google	.
so	the	policing	layer	around	the	problem	becomes	the	real	threat	of	the	act	.
now	to	understand	how	congress	came	to	write	a	bill	that	wo	n't	accomplish	its	stated	goals	,	but	will	produce	a	lot	of	pernicious	side	effects	,	you	have	to	understand	a	little	bit	about	the	back	story	.
and	the	back	story	is	this	:	sopa	and	pipa	,	as	legislation	,	were	drafted	largely	by	media	companies	that	were	founded	in	the	20th	century	.
the	20th	century	was	a	great	time	to	be	a	media	company	,	because	the	thing	you	really	had	on	your	side	was	scarcity	.
if	you	were	making	a	tv	show	,	it	did	n't	have	to	be	better	than	all	other	tv	shows	ever	made	;	it	only	had	to	be	better	than	the	two	other	shows	that	were	on	at	the	same	time	--	which	is	a	very	low	threshold	of	competitive	difficulty	.
which	meant	that	if	you	fielded	average	content	,	you	got	a	third	of	the	u.s.	public	for	free	--	tens	of	millions	of	users	for	simply	doing	something	that	was	n't	too	terrible	.
this	is	like	having	a	license	to	print	money	and	a	barrel	of	free	ink	.
but	technology	moved	on	,	as	technology	is	wont	to	do	.
and	slowly	,	slowly	,	at	the	end	of	the	20th	century	,	that	scarcity	started	to	get	eroded	--	and	i	do	n't	mean	by	digital	technology	;	i	mean	by	analog	technology	.
cassette	tapes	,	video	cassette	recorders	,	even	the	humble	xerox	machine	created	new	opportunities	for	us	to	behave	in	ways	that	astonished	the	media	business	.
because	it	turned	out	we	're	not	really	couch	potatoes	.
we	do	n't	really	like	to	only	consume	.
we	do	like	to	consume	,	but	every	time	one	of	these	new	tools	came	along	,	it	turned	out	we	also	like	to	produce	and	we	like	to	share	.
and	this	freaked	the	media	businesses	out	--	it	freaked	them	out	every	time	.
jack	valenti	,	who	was	the	head	lobbyist	for	the	motion	picture	association	of	america	,	once	likened	the	ferocious	video	cassette	recorder	to	jack	the	ripper	and	poor	,	helpless	hollywood	to	a	woman	at	home	alone	.
that	was	the	level	of	rhetoric	.
and	so	the	media	industries	begged	,	insisted	,	demanded	that	congress	do	something	.
and	congress	did	something	.
by	the	early	90s	,	congress	passed	the	law	that	changed	everything	.
and	that	law	was	called	the	audio	home	recording	act	of	1992	.
what	the	audio	home	recording	act	of	1992	said	was	,	look	,	if	people	are	taping	stuff	off	the	radio	and	then	making	mixtapes	for	their	friends	,	that	is	not	a	crime	.	that	's	okay	.
taping	and	remixing	and	sharing	with	your	friends	is	okay	.
if	you	make	lots	and	lots	of	high	quality	copies	and	you	sell	them	,	that	's	not	okay	.
but	this	taping	business	,	fine	,	let	it	go	.
and	they	thought	that	they	clarified	the	issue	,	because	they	'd	set	out	a	clear	distinction	between	legal	and	illegal	copying	.
but	that	was	n't	what	the	media	businesses	wanted	.
they	had	wanted	congress	to	outlaw	copying	full	-	stop	.
so	when	the	audio	home	recording	act	of	1992	was	passed	,	the	media	businesses	gave	up	on	the	idea	of	legal	versus	illegal	distinctions	for	copying	because	it	was	clear	that	if	congress	was	acting	in	their	framework	,	they	might	actually	increase	the	rights	of	citizens	to	participate	in	our	own	media	environment	.
so	they	went	for	plan	b	.
it	took	them	a	while	to	formulate	plan	b	.
plan	b	appeared	in	its	first	full	-	blown	form	in	1998	--	something	called	the	digital	millennium	copyright	act	.
it	was	a	complicated	piece	of	legislation	,	a	lot	of	moving	parts	.
but	the	main	thrust	of	the	dmca	was	that	it	was	legal	to	sell	you	uncopyable	digital	material	--	except	that	there	's	no	such	things	as	uncopyable	digital	material	.
it	would	be	,	as	ed	felton	once	famously	said	,	``	like	handing	out	water	that	was	n't	wet	.	``
bits	are	copyable	.	that	's	what	computers	do	.
that	is	a	side	effect	of	their	ordinary	operation	.
so	in	order	to	fake	the	ability	to	sell	uncopyable	bits	,	the	dmca	also	made	it	legal	to	force	you	to	use	systems	that	broke	the	copying	function	of	your	devices	.
every	dvd	player	and	game	player	and	television	and	computer	you	brought	home	--	no	matter	what	you	thought	you	were	getting	when	you	bought	it	--	could	be	broken	by	the	content	industries	,	if	they	wanted	to	set	that	as	a	condition	of	selling	you	the	content	.
and	to	make	sure	you	did	n't	realize	,	or	did	n't	enact	their	capabilities	as	general	purpose	computing	devices	,	they	also	made	it	illegal	for	you	to	try	to	reset	the	copyability	of	that	content	.
the	dmca	marks	the	moment	when	the	media	industries	gave	up	on	the	legal	system	of	distinguishing	between	legal	and	illegal	copying	and	simply	tried	to	prevent	copying	through	technical	means	.
now	the	dmca	had	,	and	is	continuing	to	have	,	a	lot	of	complicated	effects	,	but	in	this	one	domain	,	limiting	sharing	,	it	has	mostly	not	worked	.
and	the	main	reason	it	has	n't	worked	is	the	internet	has	turned	out	to	be	far	more	popular	and	far	more	powerful	than	anyone	imagined	.
the	mixtape	,	the	fanzine	,	that	was	nothing	compared	to	what	we	're	seeing	now	with	the	internet	.
we	are	in	a	world	where	most	american	citizens	over	the	age	of	12	share	things	with	each	other	online	.
we	share	written	things	,	we	share	images	,	we	share	audio	,	we	share	video	.
some	of	the	stuff	we	share	is	stuff	we	've	made	.
some	of	the	stuff	we	share	is	stuff	we	've	found	.
some	of	the	stuff	we	share	is	stuff	we	've	made	out	of	what	we	've	found	,	and	all	of	it	horrifies	those	industries	.
so	pipa	and	sopa	are	round	two	.
but	where	the	dmca	was	surgical	--	we	want	to	go	down	into	your	computer	,	we	want	to	go	down	into	your	television	set	,	down	into	your	game	machine	,	and	prevent	it	from	doing	what	they	said	it	would	do	at	the	store	--	pipa	and	sopa	are	nuclear	and	they	're	saying	,	we	want	to	go	anywhere	in	the	world	and	censor	content	.
now	the	mechanism	,	as	i	said	,	for	doing	this	,	is	you	need	to	take	out	anybody	pointing	to	those	ip	addresses	.
you	need	to	take	them	out	of	search	engines	,	you	need	to	take	them	out	of	online	directories	,	you	need	to	take	them	out	of	user	lists	.
and	because	the	biggest	producers	of	content	on	the	internet	are	not	google	and	yahoo	,	they	're	us	,	we	're	the	people	getting	policed	.
because	in	the	end	,	the	real	threat	to	the	enactment	of	pipa	and	sopa	is	our	ability	to	share	things	with	one	another	.
so	what	pipa	and	sopa	risk	doing	is	taking	a	centuries	-	old	legal	concept	,	innocent	until	proven	guilty	,	and	reversing	it	--	guilty	until	proven	innocent	.
you	ca	n't	share	until	you	show	us	that	you	're	not	sharing	something	we	do	n't	like	.
suddenly	,	the	burden	of	proof	for	legal	versus	illegal	falls	affirmatively	on	us	and	on	the	services	that	might	be	offering	us	any	new	capabilities	.
and	if	it	costs	even	a	dime	to	police	a	user	,	that	will	crush	a	service	with	a	hundred	million	users	.
so	this	is	the	internet	they	have	in	mind	.
imagine	this	sign	everywhere	--	except	imagine	it	does	n't	say	college	bakery	,	imagine	it	says	youtube	and	facebook	and	twitter	.
imagine	it	says	ted	,	because	the	comments	ca	n't	be	policed	at	any	acceptable	cost	.
the	real	effects	of	sopa	and	pipa	are	going	to	be	different	than	the	proposed	effects	.
the	threat	,	in	fact	,	is	this	inversion	of	the	burden	of	proof	,	where	we	suddenly	are	all	treated	like	thieves	at	every	moment	we	're	given	the	freedom	to	create	,	to	produce	or	to	share	.
and	the	people	who	provide	those	capabilities	to	us	--	the	youtubes	,	the	facebooks	,	the	twitters	and	teds	--	are	in	the	business	of	having	to	police	us	,	or	being	on	the	hook	for	contributory	infringement	.
there	's	two	things	you	can	do	to	help	stop	this	--	a	simple	thing	and	a	complicated	thing	,	an	easy	thing	and	a	hard	thing	.
the	simple	thing	,	the	easy	thing	,	is	this	:	if	you	're	an	american	citizen	,	call	your	representative	,	call	your	senator	.
when	you	look	at	the	people	who	co	-	signed	on	the	sopa	bill	,	people	who	've	co	-	signed	on	pipa	,	what	you	see	is	that	they	have	cumulatively	received	millions	and	millions	of	dollars	from	the	traditional	media	industries	.
you	do	n't	have	millions	and	millions	of	dollars	,	but	you	can	call	your	representatives	,	and	you	can	remind	them	that	you	vote	,	and	you	can	ask	not	to	be	treated	like	a	thief	,	and	you	can	suggest	that	you	would	prefer	that	the	internet	not	be	broken	.
and	if	you	're	not	an	american	citizen	,	you	can	contact	american	citizens	that	you	know	and	encourage	them	to	do	the	same	.
because	this	seems	like	a	national	issue	,	but	it	is	not	.
these	industries	will	not	be	content	with	breaking	our	internet	.
if	they	break	it	,	they	will	break	it	for	everybody	.
that	's	the	easy	thing	.
that	's	the	simple	thing	.
the	hard	thing	is	this	:	get	ready	,	because	more	is	coming	.
sopa	is	simply	a	reversion	of	coica	,	which	was	purposed	last	year	,	which	did	not	pass	.
and	all	of	this	goes	back	to	the	failure	of	the	dmca	to	disallow	sharing	as	a	technical	means	.
and	the	dmca	goes	back	to	the	audio	home	recording	act	,	which	horrified	those	industries	.
because	the	whole	business	of	actually	suggesting	that	someone	is	breaking	the	law	and	then	gathering	evidence	and	proving	that	,	that	turns	out	to	be	really	inconvenient	.
``	we	'd	prefer	not	to	do	that	,	``	says	the	content	industries	.
and	what	they	want	is	not	to	have	to	do	that	.
they	do	n't	want	legal	distinctions	between	legal	and	illegal	sharing	.
they	just	want	the	sharing	to	go	away	.
pipa	and	sopa	are	not	oddities	,	they	're	not	anomalies	,	they	're	not	events	.
they	're	the	next	turn	of	this	particular	screw	,	which	has	been	going	on	20	years	now	.
and	if	we	defeat	these	,	as	i	hope	we	do	,	more	is	coming	.
because	until	we	convince	congress	that	the	way	to	deal	with	copyright	violation	is	the	way	copyright	violation	was	dealt	with	with	napster	,	with	youtube	,	which	is	to	have	a	trial	with	all	the	presentation	of	evidence	and	the	hashing	out	of	facts	and	the	assessment	of	remedies	that	goes	on	in	democratic	societies	.
that	's	the	way	to	handle	this	.
in	the	meantime	,	the	hard	thing	to	do	is	to	be	ready	.
because	that	's	the	real	message	of	pipa	and	sopa	.
time	warner	has	called	and	they	want	us	all	back	on	the	couch	,	just	consuming	--	not	producing	,	not	sharing	--	and	we	should	say	,	``	no.	``
thank	you	.
