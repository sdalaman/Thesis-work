in	the	ocean	,	what	is	the	common	point	between	oil	,	plastic	and	 radio 	 activity 	 	?
on	the	top	line	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	bp	oil	 s 	 pill 	 	:	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 barrel 	 s 	 	of	oil	 gush 	 ing 	 	in	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	of	mexico	.
the	middle	line	is	 million 	 s 	 	of	 ton 	 s 	 	of	plastic	 deb 	 ris 	 	 accumul 	 ating 	 	in	our	ocean	,	and	the	third	line	is	 radio 	 active 	 	material	 leak 	 ing 	 	from	fukushima	nuclear	power	plant	in	the	 pac 	 ific 	 	ocean	.
well	,	the	three	big	 problem 	 s 	 	have	in	common	that	they	are	man	-	made	 problem 	 s 	 	but	they	are	controlled	by	natural	 force 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	should	make	us	feel	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 terr 	 ibly 	 	awful	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	it	should	make	us	feel	 hope 	 ful 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	we	have	the	power	to	create	these	 problem 	 s 	 	,	we	may	 a 	 s 	 	well	have	the	power	to	 re 	 mediate 	 	these	 problem 	 s 	 	.
but	what	about	natural	 force 	 s 	 	?
well	,	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	i	want	to	talk	about	 to 	 day 	 	,	is	how	we	can	use	these	natural	 force 	 s 	 	to	 re 	 mediate 	 	these	man	-	made	 problem 	 s 	 	.
when	the	bp	oil	 s 	 pill 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	i	was	 work 	 ing 	 	at	mit	,	and	i	was	in	charge	of	 develop 	 ing 	 	an	oil	 s 	 pill 	 	-	 clean 	 ing 	 	technology	.
and	i	had	a	chance	to	go	in	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	of	mexico	and	meet	some	 fish 	 er 	 men 	 	and	see	the	 terr 	 ible 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	in	which	they	 we 	 re 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	.
more	than	700	of	these	 boat 	 s 	 	,	which	are	 fish 	 er 	 men 	 	 boat 	 s 	 	repurposed	with	oil	 absorb 	 ent 	 	in	white	and	oil	 contain 	 ment 	 	in	 o 	 range 	 	,	 we 	 re 	 	used	,	but	they	 on 	 ly 	 	 collect 	 ed 	 	three	percent	of	the	oil	on	the	surface	,	and	the	health	of	the	 clean 	 ers 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 deep 	 ly 	 	 affect 	 ed 	 	.
i	was	 work 	 ing 	 	on	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	technology	at	mit	,	but	it	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	long	-	term	view	of	how	to	develop	technology	,	and	it	was	going	to	be	a	 ver 	 y 	 	expensive	technology	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	it	would	be	 patent 	 ed 	 	.
so	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	develop	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	could	develop	 ver 	 y 	 	fast	,	that	would	be	cheap	,	and	that	would	be	open	-	source	,	so	,	 be 	 cause 	 	oil	 s 	 pill 	 s 	 	are	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	the	 gu 	 lf 	 	of	mexico	,	and	that	would	be	using	 renew 	 able 	 	energy	.
so	i	quit	my	dream	job	,	and	i	 move 	 d 	 	to	new	orleans	,	and	i	 ke 	 pt 	 	on	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	how	the	oil	 s 	 pill 	 	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
 current 	 ly 	 	,	what	they	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	is	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	using	these	small	 fish 	 ing 	 	 boat 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 clean 	 ing 	 	clean	lines	in	an	ocean	of	dirt	.
if	you	're	using	the	exact	same	amount	of	surface	of	oil	 absorb 	 ent 	 	,	but	you	're	just	 pay 	 ing 	 	attention	to	natural	 pattern 	 s 	 	,	and	if	you	're	going	up	the	 wind 	 s 	 	,	you	can	collect	a	lot	more	material	.
if	you	're	 multi 	 ply 	 ing 	 	the	rig	,	so	you	 multi 	 ply 	 	how	 man 	 y 	 	 layer 	 s 	 	of	 absorb 	 ent 	 	you	're	using	,	you	can	collect	a	lot	more	.
but	it	's	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	difficult	to	move	oil	 absorb 	 ent 	 	against	the	 wind 	 s 	 	,	the	surface	 current 	 s 	 	and	the	 wave 	 s 	 	.
these	are	enormous	 force 	 s 	 	.
so	the	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	idea	was	to	use	the	ancient	 techni 	 que 	 	of	 s 	 ailing 	 	and	 tack 	 ing 	 	of	the	wind	to	capture	or	 inter 	 cept 	 	the	oil	that	is	 drift 	 ing 	 	down	the	wind	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	did	n't	 requir 	 e 	 	any	 invent 	 ion 	 	.
we	just	took	a	simple	 s 	 ailing 	 	boat	and	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	pull	 some 	 thing 	 	long	and	heavy	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	we	 tack 	 ed 	 	back	and	forth	,	what	we	lost	was	two	 thing 	 s 	 	:	we	 we 	 re 	 	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	 pull 	 ing 	 	power	and	direction	.
and	so	,	i	thought	,	what	about	if	we	just	take	the	 rud 	 der 	 	from	the	back	of	the	boat	to	the	front	,	would	we	have	better	control	?
so	i	built	 th 	 is 	 	small	 s 	 ailing 	 	robot	with	the	 rud 	 der 	 	at	the	front	,	and	i	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	pull	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	long	and	heavy	,	so	that	's	a	four	-	meter	-	long	object	just	to	pull	,	and	i	was	 surprise 	 d 	 	with	just	a	14	-	centimeter	 rud 	 der 	 	,	i	could	control	four	 meter 	 s 	 	of	 absorb 	 ent 	 	.
then	i	was	so	happy	that	i	 ke 	 pt 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	with	the	robot	,	and	so	you	see	the	robot	 ha 	 s 	 	a	front	 rud 	 der 	 	here	.
 normal 	 ly 	 	it	's	at	the	back	.
and	,	 play 	 ing 	 	,	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	the	 maneuver 	 ability 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	,	and	i	could	avoid	an	obstacle	at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	last	second	,	more	maneuverable	than	a	normal	boat	.
then	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 publish 	 ing 	 	 on 	 line 	 	,	and	some	 friend 	 s 	 	from	korea	,	they	 start 	 ed 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	we	made	a	boat	which	 ha 	 s 	 	a	front	 rud 	 der 	 	and	a	back	 rud 	 der 	 	,	so	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 interact 	 ing 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	it	was	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	better	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	small	and	a	bit	off	balance	,	but	then	we	thought	,	what	if	we	have	more	than	two	 point 	 s 	 	of	control	?
what	if	the	entire	boat	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	point	of	control	?
what	if	the	entire	boat	 change 	 s 	 	shape	?
so	--	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
and	so	that	's	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	protei	,	and	that	's	the	first	boat	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	that	 complete 	 ly 	 	 change 	 d 	 	the	shape	of	the	hull	in	order	to	control	it	,	and	the	 proper 	 ties 	 	of	 s 	 ailing 	 	that	we	get	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 super 	 ior 	 	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	a	normal	boat	.
when	we	're	 turn 	 ing 	 	,	we	have	the	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	surfing	,	and	the	way	it	's	going	up	-	wind	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	efficient	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	low	speed	,	low	wind	speed	,	and	the	 maneuver 	 ability 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	,	and	here	i	'm	going	to	do	a	small	jibe	,	and	look	at	the	position	of	the	sail	.
what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	is	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	boat	 change 	 s 	 	shape	,	the	position	of	the	front	sail	and	the	main	sail	are	different	to	the	wind	.
we	're	 catch 	 ing 	 	wind	from	both	 side 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	we	're	looking	[	for	]	if	we	want	to	pull	 some 	 thing 	 	long	and	heavy	.
we	do	n't	want	to	lose	 pull 	 ing 	 	power	,	nor	direction	.
so	,	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	know	if	 th 	 is 	 	was	possible	to	put	 th 	 is 	 	at	an	industrial	level	,	so	we	made	a	large	boat	with	a	large	sail	,	and	with	a	 ver 	 y 	 	light	hull	,	 infla 	 table 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	small	 foot 	 print 	 	,	so	we	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	big	 s 	 ize 	 	and	power	ratio	.
after	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	see	if	we	could	implement	 th 	 is 	 	and	 autom 	 ate 	 	the	system	,	so	we	used	the	same	system	but	we	 add 	 ed 	 	a	structure	to	it	so	we	could	activate	the	machine	.
so	,	we	used	the	same	bladder	-	inflated	system	,	and	we	took	it	for	 test 	 ing 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	the	netherlands	.
we	 tri 	 ed 	 	in	the	water	 with 	 out 	 	any	skin	or	 ball 	 ast 	 	just	to	see	how	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
and	then	we	 mount 	 ed 	 	a	camera	for	 controll 	 ing 	 	it	,	but	 quick 	 ly 	 	we	saw	that	we	would	need	a	lot	more	weight	at	the	bottom	,	so	we	had	to	take	it	back	to	the	lab	,	and	then	we	built	a	skin	around	it	,	we	put	 batt 	 eries 	 	,	remote	 controll 	 ers 	 	,	and	then	we	put	it	in	the	water	and	then	we	let	it	go	in	the	water	and	see	how	well	it	would	work	,	so	let	some	rope	out	,	and	hope	it	's	going	to	work	,	and	it	 work 	 ed 	 	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	but	we	still	have	a	long	way	.
our	small	prototype	 ha 	 s 	 	 give 	 n 	 	us	good	 in 	 sight 	 	that	it	's	 work 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	well	,	but	we	still	need	to	work	a	lot	more	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	what	we	are	 do 	 ing 	 	is	an	 accele 	 rated 	 	evolution	of	 s 	 ailing 	 	technology	.
we	went	from	a	back	 rud 	 der 	 	to	a	front	 rud 	 der 	 	to	two	rudders	to	 multi 	 ple 	 	rudders	to	the	whole	boat	changing	shape	,	and	the	more	we	are	moving	forward	,	and	the	more	the	design	 look 	 s 	 	simple	and	cute	.
but	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	show	you	a	fish	 be 	 cause 	 	--	in	fact	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	different	from	a	fish	.
a	fish	will	move	 be 	 cause 	 	--	by	changing	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	our	boat	is	 propel 	 led 	 	by	the	wind	still	,	and	the	hull	 control 	 s 	 	the	 tra 	 ject 	 ory 	 	.
so	i	 br 	 ought 	 	to	you	for	the	first	time	on	the	ted	stage	protei	number	eight	.	it	's	not	the	last	one	,	but	it	's	a	good	one	for	making	 demo 	 s 	 	.
so	the	first	thing	 a 	 s 	 	i	show	you	in	the	video	is	that	we	may	be	able	to	control	the	 tra 	 ject 	 ory 	 	of	a	 s 	 ailing 	 	boat	better	,	or	we	may	be	able	to	never	be	in	 iron 	 s 	 	,	so	never	facing	the	wind	,	we	 al 	 ways 	 	can	catch	the	wind	from	both	 side 	 s 	 	.
but	new	 proper 	 ties 	 	of	a	 s 	 ailing 	 	boat	.
so	if	you	're	looking	at	the	boat	from	 th 	 is 	 	side	,	 th 	 is 	 	might	 re 	 mind 	 	you	of	an	 air 	 plane 	 	profile	.
an	 air 	 plane 	 	,	when	you	're	moving	in	 th 	 is 	 	direction	,	 start 	 s 	 	to	lift	,	and	that	's	how	it	 take 	 s 	 	off	.
now	,	if	you	're	taking	the	same	system	,	and	you	're	 put 	 ting 	 	 vert 	 ical 	 	,	you	're	 bend 	 ing 	 	,	and	if	you	're	moving	 th 	 is 	 	way	forward	,	your	instinct	will	tell	you	that	you	might	go	 th 	 is 	 	way	,	but	if	you	're	moving	fast	 en 	 ough 	 	,	you	might	create	what	we	call	lateral	lift	,	so	we	could	get	further	or	 close 	 r 	 	to	the	wind	.
other	 proper 	 ty 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	a	normal	 s 	 ailing 	 	boat	 ha 	 s 	 	a	centerboard	here	and	a	 rud 	 der 	 	at	the	back	,	and	these	two	 thing 	 s 	 	are	what	 create 	 s 	 	most	 resist 	 ance 	 	and	 turbul 	 ence 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	the	boat	,	but	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	either	a	centerboard	or	a	 rud 	 der 	 	,	we	hope	that	if	we	keep	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	hull	design	we	can	improve	and	have	less	 resist 	 ance 	 	.
the	other	thing	is	,	most	 boat 	 s 	 	,	when	they	reach	a	certain	speed	,	and	they	are	going	on	 wave 	 s 	 	,	they	start	to	hit	and	 s 	 lap 	 	on	the	surface	of	the	water	,	and	a	lot	of	the	energy	moving	forward	is	lost	.
but	if	we	're	going	with	the	flow	,	if	we	pay	attention	to	natural	 pattern 	 s 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 try 	 ing 	 	to	be	strong	,	but	if	you	're	going	with	the	flow	,	we	may	absorb	a	lot	of	 environment 	 al 	 	 noise 	 s 	 	,	so	the	wave	energy	,	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 ave 	 	some	energy	to	move	forward	.
so	we	may	have	 develop 	 ed 	 	the	technology	which	is	 ver 	 y 	 	efficient	for	 pull 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	long	and	heavy	,	but	the	idea	is	,	what	is	the	purpose	of	technology	if	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	reach	the	right	 hand 	 s 	 	?
normal	technology	or	 innov 	 ation 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	:	 some 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	idea	,	some	other	scientist	or	engineer	,	they	take	it	to	the	next	level	,	they	make	a	 theor 	 y 	 	about	it	and	 may 	 be 	 	they	patent	it	,	and	then	some	industry	will	make	a	contract	of	exclusivity	to	 manufactur 	 e 	 	and	sell	it	,	and	then	,	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	a	 buy 	 er 	 	will	buy	it	,	and	we	hope	that	they	are	going	to	use	[	it	]	for	a	good	purpose	.
what	we	 re 	 ally 	 	want	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	 innov 	 ation 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	 continu 	 ously 	 	.	the	inventor	and	 engineer 	 s 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	the	 manufactur 	 ers 	 	and	 every 	 body 	 	 work 	 s 	 	at	the	same	time	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	would	be	 steril 	 e 	 	if	 th 	 is 	 	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	a	parallel	and	uncrossed	process	.
what	you	 re 	 ally 	 	want	is	not	a	 sequent 	 ial 	 	,	not	parallel	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
you	want	to	have	a	network	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
you	want	 every 	 body 	 	,	like	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	now	,	to	work	at	the	same	time	,	and	that	can	 on 	 ly 	 	happen	if	these	people	all	together	decide	to	share	the	information	,	and	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	open	 hard 	 ware 	 	is	about	.
it	's	to	replace	 com 	 petition 	 	by	 collabor 	 ation 	 	.
it	's	to	transform	any	new	product	 in 	 to 	 	a	new	market	.
so	what	is	open	 hard 	 ware 	 	?
 essential 	 ly 	 	,	open	 hard 	 ware 	 	is	a	 licens 	 e 	 	.
it	's	just	an	intellectual	 proper 	 ty 	 	 set 	 up 	 	.
it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	 every 	 body 	 	is	free	to	use	,	modify	and	 distribut 	 e 	 	,	and	in	 ex 	 change 	 	we	 on 	 ly 	 	ask	for	two	 thing 	 s 	 	:	the	name	is	 credit 	 ed 	 	--	the	name	of	the	project	--	and	 al 	 so 	 	the	people	who	make	 improve 	 ment 	 	,	they	share	back	with	the	community	.
so	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	condition	.
and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	project	 al 	 one 	 	in	a	 gar 	 age 	 	in	new	orleans	,	but	 quick 	 ly 	 	after	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	publish	and	share	 th 	 is 	 	information	,	so	i	made	a	kickstarter	,	which	is	a	crowd	-	 fund 	 raising 	 	platform	,	and	in	about	one	month	we	fundraised	30,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
with	 th 	 is 	 	money	,	i	 hire 	 d 	 	a	team	of	young	 engineer 	 s 	 	from	all	over	the	world	,	and	we	 rent 	 ed 	 	a	 factor 	 y 	 	in	rotterdam	in	the	netherlands	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	peer	-	 learn 	 ing 	 	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 engineer 	 ing 	 	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	making	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 proto 	 ty 	 ping 	 	,	but	most	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	our	 prototype 	 s 	 	in	the	water	 a 	 s 	 	often	 a 	 s 	 	possible	,	to	fail	 a 	 s 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	possible	,	to	learn	from	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	proud	member	of	protei	from	korea	,	and	on	the	right	side	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 multi 	 ple 	 	-	 mast 	 s 	 	design	 pro 	 posed 	 	by	a	team	in	mexico	.
 th 	 is 	 	idea	 re 	 ally 	 	 appeal 	 ed 	 	to	gabriella	levine	in	new	york	,	and	so	she	 decide 	 d 	 	to	prototype	 th 	 is 	 	idea	that	she	saw	,	and	she	 document 	 ed 	 	every	step	of	the	process	,	and	she	 publish 	 ed 	 	it	on	instructables	,	which	is	a	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	for	sharing	 invent 	 ions 	 	.
less	than	one	week	after	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	team	in	eindhoven	,	it	's	a	school	of	 engineer 	 ing 	 	.
they	made	it	,	but	they	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	a	 simpl 	 ified 	 	design	.
they	 al 	 so 	 	made	it	 in 	 to 	 	an	instructable	,	and	in	less	than	one	week	,	they	had	 al 	 most 	 	10,000	 view 	 s 	 	,	and	they	got	 man 	 y 	 	new	 friend 	 s 	 	.
we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 al 	 so 	 	 simpl 	 er 	 	technology	,	not	that	complex	,	with	 young 	 er 	 	people	and	 al 	 so 	 	 old 	 er 	 	people	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	dinosaur	is	from	mexico	.
so	protei	is	now	an	 inter 	 national 	 	network	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	for	selling	technology	using	 th 	 is 	 	shape	-	shifting	hull	.
and	what	 put 	 s 	 	us	together	is	that	we	have	a	common	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	,	global	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	what	the	word	``	business	``	is	,	or	what	it	should	be	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	how	most	work	 to 	 day 	 	.
business	 a 	 s 	 	usual	is	 say 	 ing 	 	,	what	's	most	 import 	 ant 	 	is	to	make	 lot 	 s 	 	of	profit	,	and	you	'll	be	using	technology	for	that	,	and	people	will	be	your	work	force	,	instrumentalized	,	and	environment	is	 usual 	 ly 	 	the	last	 prior 	 ity 	 	.
it	will	be	just	a	way	to	,	say	,	greenwash	your	audience	and	,	say	,	 in 	 crease 	 	your	price	tag	.
what	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	,	or	what	we	 believ 	 e 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	we	 believ 	 e 	 	the	world	 re 	 ally 	 	 work 	 s 	 	,	is	that	 with 	 out 	 	the	environment	you	have	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
we	have	the	people	so	we	need	to	protect	each	other	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	and	we	're	a	technology	company	,	and	profit	is	 necess 	 ary 	 	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	happen	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
if	we	have	the	courage	to	understand	or	accept	that	 th 	 is 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	how	the	world	 re 	 ally 	 	 work 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	order	of	 prior 	 ity 	 	that	we	need	to	 choos 	 e 	 	,	then	it	 make 	 s 	 	obvious	why	we	need	to	 choos 	 e 	 	open	 hard 	 ware 	 	for	 develop 	 ing 	 	 environment 	 al 	 	technology	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	need	to	share	information	.
what	's	next	for	us	?
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	small	machine	that	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	,	we	're	 hop 	 ing 	 	to	make	small	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	like	one	-	meter	remote	control	protei	that	you	can	 up 	 grade 	 	--	so	replace	the	remote	control	 part 	 s 	 	by	 and 	 roid 	 s 	 	,	so	the	mobile	phone	,	and	arduino	micro	-	 controll 	 er 	 	,	so	you	could	be	 controll 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	from	your	mobile	phone	,	your	 table 	 t 	 	.
then	what	we	want	to	do	is	create	six	-	meter	 version 	 s 	 	so	we	can	test	the	 maxim 	 um 	 	performance	of	these	 machine 	 s 	 	,	so	we	can	go	at	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	high	speed	.
so	imagine	 your 	 self 	 	.
you	are	 lay 	 ing 	 	down	in	a	 flex 	 ible 	 	torpedo	,	 s 	 ailing 	 	at	high	speed	,	 controll 	 ing 	 	the	shape	of	the	hull	with	your	 leg 	 s 	 	and	 controll 	 ing 	 	the	sail	with	your	 arm 	 s 	 	.
so	that	's	what	we	're	looking	for	 develop 	 ing 	 	.
and	we	replace	the	human	 be 	 ing 	 	--	to	go	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	for	 measur 	 ing 	 	 radio 	 activity 	 	,	you	do	n't	want	a	human	to	be	 s 	 ailing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 robot 	 s 	 	--	with	 batt 	 eries 	 	,	 motor 	 s 	 	,	micro	-	 controll 	 ers 	 	and	 sensor 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	our	 team 	 mate 	 s 	 	,	we	dream	of	at	night	.
we	hope	that	we	can	 some 	 time 	 	clean	up	oil	 s 	 pill 	 s 	 	,	or	we	can	gather	or	collect	plastic	in	the	ocean	,	or	we	can	have	 s 	 warm 	 s 	 	of	our	 machine 	 s 	 	controlled	by	multi	-	player	video	game	 engine 	 s 	 	to	control	 man 	 y 	 	of	these	 machine 	 s 	 	,	to	monitor	coral	 reef 	 s 	 	or	to	monitor	 fish 	 eries 	 	.
our	hope	is	that	we	can	use	open	 hard 	 ware 	 	technology	to	better	understand	and	protect	our	 ocean 	 s 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
