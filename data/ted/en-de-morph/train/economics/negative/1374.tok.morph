let	me	begin	with	four	 word 	 s 	 	that	will	provide	the	 con 	 text 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	week	,	four	 word 	 s 	 	that	will	come	to	define	 th 	 is 	 	century	.
here	they	are	:	the	earth	is	full	.
it	's	full	of	us	,	it	's	full	of	our	stuff	,	full	of	our	waste	,	full	of	our	 demand 	 s 	 	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	we	are	a	 brilli 	 ant 	 	and	creative	species	,	but	we	've	 create 	 d 	 	a	little	too	much	stuff	--	so	much	that	our	 eco 	 nomy 	 	is	now	 big 	 ger 	 	than	 it 	 s 	 	host	,	our	planet	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	 philosoph 	 ical 	 	 state 	 ment 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	science	based	in	physics	,	 chemist 	 ry 	 	and	biology	.
there	are	 man 	 y 	 	science	-	based	analyses	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	they	all	draw	the	same	 con 	 clusion 	 	--	that	we	're	living	beyond	our	 mean 	 s 	 	.
the	eminent	 scientist 	 s 	 	of	the	global	 foot 	 print 	 	network	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 calcul 	 ate 	 	that	we	need	about	1.5	 earth 	 s 	 	to	sustain	 th 	 is 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	to	keep	 oper 	 ating 	 	at	our	current	level	,	we	need	50	percent	more	earth	than	we	've	got	.
in	financial	 term 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	would	be	like	 al 	 ways 	 	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	50	percent	more	than	you	earn	,	going	further	 in 	 to 	 	debt	every	year	.
but	of	course	,	you	ca	n't	borrow	natural	 resource 	 s 	 	,	so	we	're	 burn 	 ing 	 	through	our	capital	,	or	 steal 	 ing 	 	from	the	future	.
so	when	i	say	full	,	i	mean	 re 	 ally 	 	full	--	well	past	any	margin	for	error	,	well	past	any	 disput 	 e 	 	about	 method 	 ology 	 	.
what	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	is	our	 eco 	 nomy 	 	is	 un 	 sustain 	 able 	 	.
i	'm	not	 say 	 ing 	 	it	's	not	nice	or	 pleas 	 ant 	 	or	that	it	's	bad	for	polar	 bear 	 s 	 	or	 forest 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	it	 certain 	 ly 	 	is	.
what	i	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	is	our	approach	is	 simpl 	 y 	 	 un 	 sustain 	 able 	 	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	 thank 	 s 	 	to	 t 	 hose 	 	 pe 	 sky 	 	 law 	 s 	 	of	physics	,	when	 thing 	 s 	 	are	n't	 sustain 	 able 	 	,	they	stop	.
but	that	's	not	possible	,	you	might	think	.
we	ca	n't	stop	economic	growth	.
 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	what	will	stop	:	economic	growth	.
it	will	stop	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	end	of	trade	 resource 	 s 	 	.
it	will	stop	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	growing	demand	of	us	on	all	the	 resource 	 s 	 	,	all	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	,	all	the	 system 	 s 	 	of	the	earth	,	which	is	now	 hav 	 ing 	 	economic	damage	.
when	we	think	about	economic	growth	 stop 	 ping 	 	,	we	go	,	``	that	's	not	possible	,	``	 be 	 cause 	 	economic	growth	is	so	essential	to	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	that	is	is	 rare 	 ly 	 	 question 	 ed 	 	.
 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	growth	 ha 	 s 	 	 certain 	 ly 	 	 deliver 	 ed 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 benefit 	 s 	 	,	it	is	an	idea	so	essential	that	we	tend	not	to	understand	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	it	not	 be 	 ing 	 	around	.
even	 th 	 ough 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 deliver 	 ed 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 benefit 	 s 	 	,	it	is	based	on	a	crazy	idea	--	the	crazy	idea	 be 	 ing 	 	that	we	can	have	infinite	growth	on	a	 fin 	 ite 	 	planet	.
and	i	'm	here	to	tell	you	the	emperor	 ha 	 s 	 	no	 clothe 	 s 	 	.
that	the	crazy	idea	is	just	that	,	it	is	crazy	,	and	with	the	earth	full	,	it	's	game	over	.
come	on	,	you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	.
that	's	not	possible	.
technology	is	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.	people	are	 innov 	 ative 	 	.
there	are	so	 man 	 y 	 	ways	we	can	improve	the	way	we	do	 thing 	 s 	 	.
we	can	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	sort	 th 	 is 	 	out	.
that	's	all	true	.
well	,	it	's	 most 	 ly 	 	true	.
we	are	 certain 	 ly 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	,	and	we	 regular 	 ly 	 	solve	complex	 problem 	 s 	 	with	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	.
so	if	our	problem	was	to	get	the	human	 eco 	 nomy 	 	down	from	150	percent	to	100	percent	of	the	earth	's	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	,	we	could	do	that	.
the	problem	is	we	're	just	 warm 	 ing 	 	up	 th 	 is 	 	growth	engine	.
we	plan	to	take	 th 	 is 	 	 high 	 ly 	 	-	 stress 	 ed 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	and	make	it	twice	 a 	 s 	 	big	and	then	make	it	four	 time 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	big	--	not	in	some	 di 	 stant 	 	future	,	but	in	less	than	40	 year 	 s 	 	,	in	the	life	time	of	most	of	you	.
 chin 	 a 	 	 plan 	 s 	 	to	be	there	in	just	20	 year 	 s 	 	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	problem	with	 th 	 is 	 	plan	is	that	it	's	not	possible	.
in	 respons 	 e 	 	,	some	people	 argu 	 e 	 	,	but	we	need	growth	,	we	need	it	to	solve	poverty	.
we	need	it	to	develop	technology	.
we	need	it	to	keep	social	 st 	 ability 	 	.
i	find	 th 	 is 	 	argument	 fasci 	 nating 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	we	can	kind	of	bend	the	 rule 	 s 	 	of	physics	to	suit	our	 need 	 s 	 	.
it	's	like	the	earth	 do 	 es 	 	n't	care	what	we	need	.
mother	nature	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 negoti 	 ate 	 	;	she	just	 set 	 s 	 	 rule 	 s 	 	and	 de 	 scribe 	 s 	 	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	.
and	these	are	not	esoteric	 limit 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	about	food	and	water	,	 s 	 oil 	 	and	climate	,	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	practical	and	economic	 found 	 ations 	 	of	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
so	the	idea	that	we	can	 smooth 	 ly 	 	 transit 	 ion 	 	to	a	 high 	 ly 	 	-	efficient	,	solar	-	powered	,	knowledge	-	based	 eco 	 nomy 	 	 transform 	 ed 	 	by	science	and	technology	so	that	nine	billion	people	can	live	in	2050	a	life	of	abundance	and	digital	 download 	 s 	 	is	a	delusion	.
it	's	not	that	it	's	not	possible	to	feed	,	clothe	and	house	us	all	and	have	us	live	 de 	 cent 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
it	 certain 	 ly 	 	is	.
but	the	idea	that	we	can	 gent 	 ly 	 	grow	there	with	a	few	minor	 hicc 	 up 	 s 	 	is	just	wrong	,	and	it	's	 danger 	 ously 	 	wrong	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 mean 	 s 	 	we	're	not	 get 	 ting 	 	ready	for	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	going	to	happen	.
see	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	you	 oper 	 ate 	 	a	system	past	 it 	 s 	 	 limit 	 s 	 	and	then	keep	on	going	at	an	ever	-	 accele 	 rating 	 	rate	is	that	the	system	 stop 	 s 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	and	 break 	 s 	 	down	.
and	that	's	what	will	happen	to	us	.
 man 	 y 	 	of	you	will	be	 think 	 ing 	 	,	but	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	we	can	still	stop	 th 	 is 	 	.
if	it	's	that	bad	,	we	'll	react	.
let	's	just	think	through	that	idea	.
now	we	've	had	50	 year 	 s 	 	of	 war 	 ning 	 s 	 	.
we	've	had	science	 prov 	 ing 	 	the	 urge 	 ncy 	 	of	change	.
we	've	had	economic	analysis	 point 	 ing 	 	out	that	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	can	we	afford	it	,	it	's	 cheap 	 er 	 	to	act	early	.
and	yet	,	the	 re 	 ality 	 	is	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	change	course	.
we	're	not	even	 s 	 low 	 ing 	 	down	.
last	year	on	climate	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	we	had	the	highest	global	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	ever	.
the	story	on	food	,	on	water	,	on	 s 	 oil 	 	,	on	climate	is	all	much	the	same	.
i	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	n't	say	 th 	 is 	 	in	despair	.
i	've	 d 	 one 	 	my	 griev 	 ing 	 	about	the	loss	.
i	accept	where	we	are	.
it	is	 s 	 ad 	 	,	but	it	is	what	it	is	.
but	it	is	 al 	 so 	 	time	that	we	 end 	 ed 	 	our	 deni 	 al 	 	that	we	're	not	 act 	 ing 	 	,	we	're	not	close	to	 act 	 ing 	 	and	we	're	not	going	to	act	 un 	 til 	 	 th 	 is 	 	crisis	 hit 	 s 	 	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
and	that	's	why	the	end	of	growth	is	the	central	issue	and	the	event	that	we	need	to	get	ready	for	.
so	when	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 transit 	 ion 	 	begin	?
when	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 break 	 down 	 	begin	?
in	my	view	,	it	is	well	 under 	 way 	 	.
i	know	most	people	do	n't	see	it	that	way	.
we	tend	to	look	at	the	world	,	not	 a 	 s 	 	the	 integrate 	 d 	 	system	that	it	is	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	individual	 issue 	 s 	 	.
we	see	the	occupy	 protest 	 s 	 	,	we	see	 spiral 	 ing 	 	debt	 cri 	 s 	 es 	 	,	we	see	growing	 ine 	 quality 	 	,	we	see	money	's	influence	on	 politic 	 s 	 	,	we	see	resource	constraint	,	food	and	oil	 price 	 s 	 	.
but	we	see	,	 mistak 	 en 	 ly 	 	,	each	of	these	 issue 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	individual	 problem 	 s 	 	to	be	 solve 	 d 	 	.
in	fact	,	it	's	the	system	in	the	 pain 	 ful 	 	process	of	 break 	 ing 	 	down	--	our	system	,	of	debt	-	 fuel 	 ed 	 	economic	growth	,	of	 in 	 effective 	 	 demo 	 cracy 	 	,	of	 over 	 load 	 ing 	 	planet	earth	,	is	eating	 it 	 self 	 	 al 	 ive 	 	.
i	could	give	you	 count 	 less 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	and	evidence	to	prove	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	i	wo	n't	 be 	 cause 	 	,	if	you	want	to	see	it	,	that	evidence	is	all	around	you	.
i	want	to	talk	to	you	about	fear	.
i	want	to	do	so	 be 	 cause 	 	,	in	my	view	,	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	issue	we	face	is	how	we	respond	to	 th 	 is 	 	question	.
the	crisis	is	now	 inevit 	 able 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	issue	is	,	how	will	we	react	?
of	course	,	we	ca	n't	know	what	will	happen	.
the	future	is	 inherent 	 ly 	 	 un 	 certain 	 	.
but	let	's	just	think	through	what	the	science	is	 tell 	 ing 	 	us	is	 like 	 ly 	 	to	happen	.
imagine	our	 eco 	 nomy 	 	when	the	carbon	bubble	 burst 	 s 	 	,	when	the	financial	 market 	 s 	 	 recogn 	 ize 	 	that	,	to	have	any	hope	of	 prevent 	 ing 	 	the	climate	 spiral 	 ing 	 	out	of	control	,	the	oil	and	coal	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	are	 finish 	 ed 	 	.
imagine	 chin 	 a 	 	,	india	and	pakistan	going	to	war	 a 	 s 	 	climate	 impact 	 s 	 	generate	conflict	over	food	and	water	.
imagine	the	middle	east	 with 	 out 	 	oil	income	,	but	with	 col 	 lap 	 s 	 ing 	 	 government 	 s 	 	.
imagine	our	 high 	 ly 	 	-	tuned	,	just	-	in	-	time	food	industry	and	our	 high 	 ly 	 	-	 stress 	 ed 	 	 agricultur 	 al 	 	system	 fail 	 ing 	 	and	 super 	 market 	 	 shelv 	 es 	 	 empty 	 ing 	 	.
imagine	30	percent	 un 	 employ 	 ment 	 	in	america	 a 	 s 	 	the	global	 eco 	 nomy 	 	is	 grip 	 ped 	 	by	fear	and	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	.
now	imagine	what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	for	you	,	your	family	,	your	 friend 	 s 	 	,	your	personal	financial	security	.
imagine	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	for	your	personal	security	 a 	 s 	 	a	 heav 	 ily 	 	 arm 	 ed 	 	 civil 	 ian 	 	population	 get 	 s 	 	 ang 	 rier 	 	and	 ang 	 rier 	 	about	why	 th 	 is 	 	was	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	happen	.
imagine	what	you	'll	tell	your	children	when	they	ask	you	,	``	so	,	in	2012	,	mom	and	dad	,	what	was	it	like	when	you	'd	had	the	 hot 	 test 	 	decade	on	record	for	the	third	decade	in	a	row	,	when	every	scientific	body	in	the	world	was	 say 	 ing 	 	you	've	got	a	major	problem	,	when	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 acid 	 ifying 	 	,	when	oil	and	food	 price 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 spi 	 king 	 	,	when	they	 we 	 re 	 	 riot 	 ing 	 	in	the	 street 	 s 	 	of	london	and	 occupy 	 ing 	 	wall	street	?
when	the	system	was	so	 clear 	 ly 	 	 break 	 ing 	 	down	,	mom	and	dad	,	what	did	you	do	,	what	 we 	 re 	 	you	 think 	 ing 	 	?	``
so	how	do	you	feel	when	the	 light 	 s 	 	go	out	on	the	global	 eco 	 nomy 	 	in	your	mind	,	when	your	 assumption 	 s 	 	about	the	future	 fad 	 e 	 	away	and	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	different	 emerge 	 s 	 	?
just	take	a	moment	and	take	a	breath	and	think	,	what	do	you	feel	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	?
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 deni 	 al 	 	.
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	anger	.
 may 	 be 	 	fear	.
of	course	,	we	ca	n't	know	what	's	going	to	happen	and	we	have	to	live	with	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	.
but	when	we	think	about	the	kind	of	 possibil 	 ities 	 	i	paint	,	we	should	feel	a	bit	of	fear	.
we	are	in	danger	,	all	of	us	,	and	we	've	 evolv 	 ed 	 	to	respond	to	danger	with	fear	to	 motiv 	 ate 	 	a	 power 	 ful 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	,	to	help	us	 brave 	 ly 	 	face	a	threat	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	time	it	's	not	a	tiger	at	the	cave	mouth	.
you	ca	n't	see	the	danger	at	your	door	.
but	if	you	look	,	you	can	see	it	at	the	door	of	your	 civil 	 ization 	 	.
that	's	why	we	need	to	feel	our	 respons 	 e 	 	now	while	the	 light 	 s 	 	are	still	on	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	we	wait	 un 	 til 	 	the	crisis	 take 	 s 	 	hold	,	we	may	panic	and	hide	.
if	we	feel	it	now	and	think	it	through	,	we	will	 real 	 ize 	 	we	have	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	fear	but	fear	 it 	 self 	 	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	will	get	 ug 	 ly 	 	,	and	it	will	happen	soon	--	 certain 	 ly 	 	in	our	 life 	 time 	 	--	but	we	are	more	than	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 get 	 ting 	 	through	 every 	 thing 	 	that	's	coming	.
you	see	,	 t 	 hose 	 	people	that	have	faith	that	 human 	 s 	 	can	solve	any	problem	,	that	technology	is	 limit 	 less 	 	,	that	 market 	 s 	 	can	be	a	force	for	good	,	are	in	fact	right	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	they	're	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	is	that	it	 take 	 s 	 	a	good	crisis	to	get	us	going	.
when	we	feel	fear	and	we	fear	loss	we	are	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 quit 	 e 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
think	about	war	.
after	the	 bomb 	 ing 	 	of	pearl	harbor	,	it	just	took	four	 day 	 s 	 	for	the	government	to	ban	the	production	of	 civil 	 ian 	 	 car 	 s 	 	and	to	 re 	 direct 	 	the	auto	industry	,	and	from	there	to	 ration 	 ing 	 	of	food	and	energy	.
think	about	how	a	company	 respond 	 s 	 	to	a	 bankrupt 	 cy 	 	threat	and	how	a	change	that	 seem 	 ed 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	just	 get 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	.
think	about	how	an	individual	 respond 	 s 	 	to	a	 diagnos 	 is 	 	of	a	life	-	 threaten 	 ing 	 	 ill 	 ness 	 	and	how	 life 	 style 	 	 change 	 s 	 	that	 previous 	 ly 	 	 we 	 re 	 	just	too	difficult	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 relat 	 ively 	 	easy	.
we	are	smart	,	in	fact	,	we	 re 	 ally 	 	are	 quit 	 e 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	,	but	we	do	love	a	good	crisis	.
and	the	good	news	,	 th 	 is 	 	one	's	a	 mon 	 ster 	 	.
 s 	 ure 	 	,	if	we	get	it	wrong	,	we	could	face	the	end	of	 th 	 is 	 	 civil 	 ization 	 	,	but	if	we	get	it	right	,	it	could	be	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	 civil 	 ization 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	.
and	how	cool	would	it	be	to	tell	your	 grand 	 children 	 	that	you	 we 	 re 	 	part	of	that	?
there	's	 certain 	 ly 	 	no	technical	or	economic	 bar 	 rier 	 	in	the	way	.
 scientist 	 s 	 	like	james	hansen	tell	us	we	may	need	to	eliminate	net	co	2	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	from	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	in	just	a	few	 decade 	 s 	 	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	know	what	that	would	take	,	so	i	 work 	 ed 	 	with	professor	jorgen	randers	from	norway	to	find	the	answer	.
we	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	plan	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	one	degree	war	plan	``	--	so	named	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	level	of	 mobil 	 ization 	 	and	focus	 requir 	 ed 	 	.
to	my	surprise	,	 elimi 	 nating 	 	net	co	2	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	from	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	in	just	20	 year 	 s 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	easy	and	 pre 	 tty 	 	cheap	,	not	 ver 	 y 	 	cheap	,	but	 certain 	 ly 	 	less	than	the	cost	of	a	 col 	 lap 	 s 	 ing 	 	 civil 	 ization 	 	.
we	did	n't	 calcul 	 ate 	 	that	 precise 	 ly 	 	,	but	we	understand	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	expensive	.
you	can	read	the	 detail 	 s 	 	,	but	in	 summ 	 ary 	 	,	we	can	transform	our	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
we	can	do	it	with	proven	technology	.
we	can	do	it	at	an	 afford 	 able 	 	cost	.
we	can	do	it	with	 exist 	 ing 	 	 politic 	 al 	 	 structure 	 s 	 	.
the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	we	need	to	change	is	how	we	think	and	how	we	feel	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	you	come	in	.
when	we	think	about	the	future	i	paint	,	of	course	we	should	feel	a	bit	of	fear	.
but	fear	can	be	 para 	 ly 	 z 	 ing 	 	or	 motiv 	 ating 	 	.
we	need	to	accept	the	fear	and	then	we	need	to	act	.
we	need	to	act	like	the	future	 depend 	 s 	 	on	it	.
we	need	to	act	like	we	 on 	 ly 	 	have	one	planet	.
we	can	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	know	the	free	market	 fundamental 	 ists 	 	will	tell	you	that	more	growth	,	more	stuff	and	nine	billion	people	going	 shop 	 ping 	 	is	the	best	we	can	do	.
they	're	wrong	.
we	can	be	more	,	we	can	be	much	more	.
we	have	 achiev 	 ed 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	since	 work 	 ing 	 	out	how	to	grow	food	some	10,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
we	've	built	a	 power 	 ful 	 	 found 	 ation 	 	of	science	,	knowledge	and	technology	--	more	than	 en 	 ough 	 	to	build	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	where	nine	billion	people	can	lead	 de 	 cent 	 	,	 meaning 	 ful 	 	and	 satisfy 	 ing 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
the	earth	can	support	that	if	we	 choos 	 e 	 	the	right	path	.
we	can	 choos 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	moment	of	crisis	to	ask	and	answer	the	big	 question 	 s 	 	of	 socie 	 ty 	 	's	evolution	--	like	,	what	do	we	want	to	be	when	we	grow	up	,	when	we	move	past	 th 	 is 	 	 bum 	 bling 	 	adolescence	where	we	think	there	are	no	 limit 	 s 	 	and	suffer	 delusion 	 s 	 	of	 im 	 mortal 	 ity 	 	?
well	it	's	time	to	grow	up	,	to	be	 wis 	 er 	 	,	to	be	 calm 	 er 	 	,	to	be	more	 consider 	 ed 	 	.
like	 generation 	 s 	 	before	us	,	we	'll	be	growing	up	in	war	--	not	a	war	between	 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	,	but	a	war	for	 civil 	 ization 	 	,	for	the	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	build	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	which	is	 strong 	 er 	 	and	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	and	 plan 	 s 	 	on	 stay 	 ing 	 	around	 in 	 to 	 	middle	age	.
we	can	 choos 	 e 	 	life	over	fear	.
we	can	do	what	we	need	to	do	,	but	it	will	take	every	entrepreneur	,	every	artist	,	every	scientist	,	every	communicator	,	every	mother	,	every	father	,	every	child	,	every	one	of	us	.
 th 	 is 	 	could	be	our	 fin 	 est 	 	hour	.
