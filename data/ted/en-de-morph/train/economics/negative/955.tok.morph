if	 noth 	 ing 	 	else	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	i	've	 discover 	 ed 	 	what	it	is	we	put	our	 speaker 	 s 	 	through	:	 sweat 	 y 	 	 palm 	 s 	 	,	 sleep 	 less 	 	 night 	 s 	 	,	a	 who 	 lly 	 	 un 	 natural 	 	fear	of	 clock 	 s 	 	.
i	mean	,	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	brutal	.
and	i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	a	little	nervous	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
there	are	nine	billion	 human 	 s 	 	coming	our	way	.
now	,	the	most	 optimist 	 ic 	 	 dream 	 s 	 	can	get	 dent 	 ed 	 	by	the	prospect	of	people	 plunder 	 ing 	 	the	planet	.
but	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	i	've	 be 	 come 	 	 intrigu 	 ed 	 	by	a	different	way	of	 think 	 ing 	 	of	large	human	 crowd 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	are	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	where	they	can	do	 some 	 thing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	.
it	's	a	 phenomen 	 on 	 	that	i	think	any	 organ 	 ization 	 	or	individual	can	tap	 in 	 to 	 	.
it	 certain 	 ly 	 	 impact 	 ed 	 	the	way	we	think	about	ted	's	future	,	and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	the	world	's	future	 over 	 all 	 	.
so	,	let	's	explore	.
the	story	 start 	 s 	 	with	just	a	single	person	,	a	child	,	 behav 	 ing 	 	a	little	 strange 	 ly 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	kid	is	known	 on 	 line 	 	 a 	 s 	 	lil	demon	.
he	's	 do 	 ing 	 	 trick 	 s 	 	here	,	dance	 trick 	 s 	 	,	that	 prob 	 ably 	 	no	six	-	year	-	old	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	ever	 manage 	 d 	 	before	.
how	did	he	learn	them	?
and	what	drove	him	to	 s 	 pend 	 	the	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 hour 	 s 	 	of	practice	 th 	 is 	 	must	have	taken	?
here	's	a	clue	.
lil	demon	:	♫	step	your	game	up	.	oh	.	oh	.	♫	♫	step	your	game	up	.	oh	.	oh	.	♫	chris	anderson	:	so	,	that	was	 s 	 ent 	 	to	me	by	 th 	 is 	 	man	,	a	 film 	 maker 	 	,	jonathan	chu	,	who	told	me	that	was	the	moment	he	 real 	 ized 	 	the	 inter 	 net 	 	was	 caus 	 ing 	 	dance	to	evolve	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	he	 s 	 aid 	 	at	ted	in	february	.
in	 es 	 s 	 ence 	 	,	 danc 	 ers 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 challeng 	 ing 	 	each	other	 on 	 line 	 	to	get	better	;	 in 	 credible 	 	new	dance	 skill 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 invent 	 ed 	 	;	even	the	six	-	year	-	olds	 we 	 re 	 	 join 	 ing 	 	in	.
it	felt	like	a	revolution	.
and	so	jon	had	a	 brilli 	 ant 	 	idea	:	he	went	out	to	recruit	the	best	of	the	best	 danc 	 ers 	 	off	of	youtube	to	create	 th 	 is 	 	dance	 trou 	 pe 	 	--	the	league	of	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 danc 	 ers 	 	,	the	lxd	.
i	mean	,	these	 kid 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	web	-	taught	,	but	they	 we 	 re 	 	so	good	that	they	got	to	play	at	the	oscars	 th 	 is 	 	year	.
and	at	ted	here	in	february	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 pass 	 ion 	 	and	 brilli 	 ance 	 	just	took	our	breath	away	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	story	of	the	evolution	of	dance	 seem 	 s 	 	 strange 	 ly 	 	familiar	.
you	know	,	a	while	after	tedtalks	 start 	 ed 	 	taking	off	,	we	 notice 	 d 	 	that	 speaker 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	to	 s 	 pend 	 	a	lot	more	time	in	 pre 	 par 	 ation 	 	.
it	was	 result 	 ing 	 	in	 in 	 credible 	 	new	 talk 	 s 	 	like	these	two	.
...	 month 	 s 	 	of	 pre 	 par 	 ation 	 	 cram 	 med 	 	 in 	 to 	 	18	 minute 	 s 	 	,	raising	the	bar	 cruel 	 ly 	 	for	the	next	generation	of	 speaker 	 s 	 	,	with	the	 effect 	 s 	 	that	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	week	.
it	's	not	 a 	 s 	 	if	j.j.	and	jill	 actual 	 ly 	 	 end 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 talk 	 s 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	step	your	game	up	,	``	but	they	might	 a 	 s 	 	well	have	.
so	,	in	both	of	these	 case 	 s 	 	,	you	've	got	these	 cycle 	 s 	 	of	 improve 	 ment 	 	,	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	driven	by	people	 watch 	 ing 	 	web	video	.
what	is	going	on	here	?
well	,	i	think	it	's	the	 lat 	 est 	 	iteration	of	a	 phenomen 	 on 	 	we	can	call	``	crowd	-	 accele 	 rated 	 	 innov 	 ation 	 	.	``
and	there	are	just	three	 thing 	 s 	 	you	need	for	 th 	 is 	 	thing	to	kick	 in 	 to 	 	gear	.
you	can	think	of	them	 a 	 s 	 	three	 dial 	 s 	 	on	a	giant	wheel	.
you	turn	up	the	 dial 	 s 	 	,	the	wheel	 start 	 s 	 	to	turn	.
and	the	first	thing	you	need	is	...	a	crowd	,	a	group	of	people	who	share	a	common	interest	.
the	 big 	 ger 	 	the	crowd	,	the	more	potential	 innov 	 ators 	 	there	are	.
that	's	 import 	 ant 	 	,	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	most	people	in	the	crowd	occupy	these	other	 role 	 s 	 	.
they	're	creating	the	 eco 	 system 	 	from	which	 innov 	 ation 	 	 emerge 	 s 	 	.
the	second	thing	you	need	is	light	.
you	need	clear	,	open	 vis 	 ibility 	 	of	what	the	best	people	in	that	crowd	are	 cap 	 able 	 	of	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	is	how	you	will	learn	how	you	will	be	 empower 	 ed 	 	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	.
and	third	,	you	need	 desir 	 e 	 	.
you	know	,	 innov 	 ation 	 	's	hard	work	.
it	's	based	on	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 hour 	 s 	 	of	research	,	of	practice	.
absent	 desir 	 e 	 	,	not	going	to	happen	.
now	,	here	's	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	--	pre	-	 inter 	 net 	 	--	of	 th 	 is 	 	machine	in	action	.
 danc 	 ers 	 	at	a	street	corner	--	it	's	a	crowd	,	a	small	one	,	but	they	can	all	 obvious 	 ly 	 	see	what	each	other	can	do	.
and	the	 desir 	 e 	 	part	 come 	 s 	 	,	i	guess	,	from	social	 stat 	 us 	 	,	right	?
best	 danc 	 er 	 	 walk 	 s 	 	tall	,	 get 	 s 	 	the	best	date	.
there	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	going	to	be	some	 innov 	 ation 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	here	.
but	on	the	web	,	all	three	 dial 	 s 	 	are	 ratchet 	 ed 	 	right	up	.
the	dance	community	is	now	global	.
there	's	 million 	 s 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	.
and	 amaz 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	you	can	still	see	what	the	best	can	do	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	crowd	 it 	 self 	 	 shine 	 s 	 	a	light	on	them	,	either	 direct 	 ly 	 	,	through	 comment 	 s 	 	,	 rating 	 s 	 	,	email	,	facebook	,	twitter	,	or	 in 	 direct 	 ly 	 	,	through	 number 	 s 	 	of	 view 	 s 	 	,	through	 link 	 s 	 	that	point	google	there	.
so	,	it	's	easy	to	find	the	good	stuff	,	and	when	you	've	found	it	,	you	can	watch	it	in	close	-	up	 repeat 	 ed 	 ly 	 	and	read	what	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	people	have	written	about	it	.
that	's	a	lot	of	light	.
but	the	 desir 	 e 	 	element	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 dial 	 ed 	 	way	up	.
i	mean	,	you	might	just	be	a	kid	with	a	 web 	 cam 	 	,	but	if	you	can	do	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 go 	 es 	 	viral	,	you	get	to	be	 s 	 een 	 	by	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	 s 	 port 	 s 	 	 stad 	 ium 	 s 	 	 cram 	 med 	 	with	people	.
you	get	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 strange 	 rs 	 	writing	 excit 	 ed 	 ly 	 	about	you	.
and	even	if	it	's	not	that	eloquent	--	and	it	's	not	--	it	can	still	 re 	 ally 	 	make	your	day	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	a	new	type	of	global	 re 	 cognition 	 	,	i	think	,	is	 driv 	 ing 	 	huge	 amount 	 s 	 	of	effort	.
and	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	note	that	it	's	not	just	the	 star 	 s 	 	who	are	 benefit 	 ing 	 	:	 be 	 cause 	 	you	can	see	the	best	,	 every 	 one 	 	can	learn	.
 al 	 so 	 	,	the	system	is	self	-	 fuel 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	the	crowd	that	 shine 	 s 	 	the	light	and	 fuel 	 s 	 	the	 desir 	 e 	 	,	but	the	light	and	 desir 	 e 	 	are	a	lethal	one	-	two	combination	that	attract	new	people	to	the	crowd	.
so	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	model	that	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	any	 organ 	 ization 	 	could	use	to	try	and	nurture	 it 	 s 	 	own	cycle	of	crowd	-	 accele 	 rated 	 	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
 invit 	 e 	 	the	crowd	,	let	in	the	light	,	dial	up	the	 desir 	 e 	 	.
and	the	 hard 	 est 	 	part	about	that	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	light	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 mean 	 s 	 	you	have	to	open	up	,	you	have	to	show	your	stuff	to	the	world	.
it	's	by	giving	away	what	you	think	is	your	 deep 	 est 	 	secret	that	 may 	 be 	 	 million 	 s 	 	of	people	are	 empower 	 ed 	 	to	help	improve	it	.
and	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 hap 	 pi 	 ly 	 	,	there	's	one	class	of	people	who	 re 	 ally 	 	ca	n't	make	use	of	 th 	 is 	 	tool	.
the	dark	side	of	the	web	is	 alle 	 rgic 	 	to	the	light	.
i	do	n't	think	we	're	going	to	see	 terrorist 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 publish 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 plan 	 s 	 	 on 	 line 	 	and	 say 	 ing 	 	to	the	world	,	``	 pleas 	 e 	 	,	could	you	help	us	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	make	them	work	 th 	 is 	 	time	?	``
but	you	can	publish	your	stuff	 on 	 line 	 	.
and	if	you	can	get	that	wheel	to	turn	,	look	out	.
so	,	at	ted	,	we	've	 be 	 come 	 	a	little	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	 open 	 ness 	 	.
in	fact	,	my	 col 	 league 	 	,	june	cohen	,	 ha 	 s 	 	taken	to	 call 	 ing 	 	it	``	radical	 open 	 ness 	 	,	``	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 work 	 s 	 	for	us	each	time	.
we	 open 	 ed 	 	up	our	 talk 	 s 	 	to	the	world	,	and	 sudden 	 ly 	 	there	are	 million 	 s 	 	of	people	out	there	 help 	 ing 	 	spread	our	 speaker 	 s 	 	'	 idea 	 s 	 	,	and	 there 	 by 	 	making	it	 eas 	 ier 	 	for	us	to	recruit	and	 motiv 	 ate 	 	the	next	generation	of	 speaker 	 s 	 	.
by	 open 	 ing 	 	up	our	 transl 	 ation 	 	program	,	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 hero 	 ic 	 	 volunteer 	 s 	 	--	some	of	them	 watch 	 ing 	 	 on 	 line 	 	right	now	,	and	thank	you	!	--	have	 transl 	 ated 	 	our	 talk 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	more	than	70	 language 	 s 	 	,	 there 	 by 	 	 trip 	 ling 	 	our	 view 	 er 	 ship 	 	in	non	-	english	-	 s 	 peaking 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	.
by	giving	away	our	 ted 	 x 	 	brand	,	we	 sudden 	 ly 	 	have	a	thousand	-	plus	live	 experiment 	 s 	 	in	the	art	of	 spread 	 ing 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	.
and	these	 organize 	 rs 	 	,	they	're	 see 	 ing 	 	each	other	,	they	're	 learn 	 ing 	 	from	each	other	.
we	are	 learn 	 ing 	 	from	them	.
we	're	 get 	 ting 	 	great	 talk 	 s 	 	back	from	them	.
the	wheel	is	 turn 	 ing 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	step	back	a	minute	.
i	mean	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	not	news	for	me	to	tell	you	that	 innov 	 ation 	 	 emerge 	 s 	 	out	of	 group 	 s 	 	.
you	know	,	we	've	heard	that	 th 	 is 	 	week	--	 th 	 is 	 	romantic	 not 	 ion 	 	of	the	lone	 gen 	 ius 	 	with	the	``	eureka	!	``	moment	that	 change 	 s 	 	the	world	is	 mis 	 lead 	 ing 	 	.
even	he	 s 	 aid 	 	that	,	and	he	would	know	.
we	're	a	social	species	.
we	spark	off	each	other	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	not	news	to	say	that	the	 inter 	 net 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 accele 	 rated 	 	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
for	the	past	15	 year 	 s 	 	,	 power 	 ful 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 connect 	 ing 	 	 on 	 line 	 	,	 spark 	 ing 	 	off	each	other	.
if	you	take	 programm 	 ers 	 	,	you	know	,	the	whole	open	-	source	 move 	 ment 	 	is	a	fantastic	 in 	 stance 	 	of	crowd	-	 accele 	 rated 	 	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
but	what	's	key	here	is	,	the	reason	these	 group 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	connect	is	 be 	 cause 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	work	 out 	 put 	 	is	of	the	type	that	can	be	 eas 	 ily 	 	 share 	 d 	 	 digital 	 ly 	 	--	a	picture	,	a	music	file	,	 soft 	 ware 	 	.
and	that	's	why	what	i	'm	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	,	and	what	i	think	is	under	-	 report 	 ed 	 	,	is	the	 sign 	 ific 	 ance 	 	of	the	rise	of	 on 	 line 	 	video	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	technology	that	's	going	to	allow	the	rest	of	the	world	's	 talent 	 s 	 	to	be	 share 	 d 	 	 digital 	 ly 	 	,	 there 	 by 	 	 launch 	 ing 	 	a	whole	new	cycle	of	crowd	-	 accele 	 rated 	 	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
the	first	few	 year 	 s 	 	of	the	web	 we 	 re 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	video	-	free	,	for	 th 	 is 	 	reason	:	video	 file 	 s 	 	are	huge	;	the	web	could	n't	handle	them	.
but	in	the	last	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	 band 	 width 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 explode 	 d 	 	a	 hundred 	 fold 	 	.
 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	here	we	are	.
 human 	 ity 	 	 watch 	 es 	 	80	million	 hour 	 s 	 	of	youtube	every	day	.
cisco	 actual 	 ly 	 	 estimate 	 s 	 	that	,	 with 	 in 	 	four	 year 	 s 	 	,	more	than	90	percent	of	the	web	's	data	will	be	video	.
if	it	's	all	 pup 	 pies 	 	,	porn	and	 pi 	 racy 	 	,	we	're	 doom 	 ed 	 	.
i	do	n't	think	it	will	be	.
video	is	high	-	 band 	 width 	 	for	a	reason	.
it	 pack 	 s 	 	a	huge	amount	of	data	,	and	our	 brain 	 s 	 	are	 un 	 ique 	 ly 	 	wired	to	decode	it	.
here	,	let	me	 introduc 	 e 	 	you	to	sam	haber	.
he	's	a	 uni 	 cyclist 	 	.
before	youtube	,	there	was	no	way	for	him	to	discover	his	 s 	 port 	 	's	true	potential	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	ca	n't	communicate	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	in	 word 	 s 	 	,	right	?
but	looking	at	video	 clip 	 s 	 	 post 	 ed 	 	by	 strange 	 rs 	 	,	a	world	of	 possibil 	 ity 	 	 open 	 s 	 	up	for	him	.
 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	he	 start 	 s 	 	to	 emul 	 ate 	 	and	then	to	 innov 	 ate 	 	.
and	a	global	community	of	 uni 	 cyclist 	 s 	 	discover	each	other	 on 	 line 	 	,	inspire	each	other	to	 great 	 ness 	 	.
and	there	are	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	other	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	--	of	video	-	driven	evolution	of	 skill 	 s 	 	,	ranging	from	the	physical	to	the	 art 	 ful 	 	.
and	i	have	to	tell	you	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 form 	 er 	 	 publish 	 er 	 	of	 hobby 	 ist 	 	 magazine 	 s 	 	,	i	find	 th 	 is 	 	 strange 	 ly 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
i	mean	,	there	's	a	lot	of	 pass 	 ion 	 	right	here	on	 th 	 is 	 	screen	.
but	if	rube	goldberg	 machine 	 s 	 	and	video	 poet 	 ry 	 	are	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	your	cup	of	tea	,	how	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
jove	is	a	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	that	was	 found 	 ed 	 	to	 encourag 	 e 	 	 scientist 	 s 	 	to	publish	 the 	 ir 	 	peer	-	 review 	 ed 	 	research	on	video	.
there	's	a	problem	with	a	 tradition 	 al 	 	scientific	paper	.
it	can	take	 month 	 s 	 	for	a	scientist	in	 an 	 other 	 	lab	to	figure	out	how	to	replicate	the	 experiment 	 s 	 	that	are	 de 	 scribed 	 	in	print	.
here	's	one	 s 	 uch 	 	 frust 	 rated 	 	scientist	,	moshe	pritsker	,	the	founder	of	jove	.
he	told	me	that	the	world	is	 was 	 ting 	 	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	video	.
i	mean	,	look	:	if	you	can	show	 in 	 stead 	 	of	just	 de 	 s 	 crib 	 ing 	 	,	that	problem	 go 	 es 	 	away	.
so	it	's	not	far	-	 fetch 	 ed 	 	to	say	that	,	at	some	point	,	 on 	 line 	 	video	is	going	to	 dramat 	 ically 	 	 accele 	 rate 	 	scientific	advance	.
here	's	 an 	 other 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	that	's	close	to	our	 heart 	 s 	 	at	ted	,	where	video	is	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	more	 power 	 ful 	 	than	print	--	the	sharing	of	an	idea	.
why	do	people	like	 watch 	 ing 	 	tedtalks	?
all	 t 	 hose 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 ready 	 	out	there	in	print	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	to	read	than	to	view	.
why	would	 some 	 one 	 	 both 	 er 	 	?
well	,	so	,	there	's	some	 show 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 tell 	 ing 	 	.
but	even	 leav 	 ing 	 	the	screen	out	of	it	,	there	's	still	a	lot	more	 be 	 ing 	 	 transfer 	 red 	 	than	just	 word 	 s 	 	.
and	in	that	non	-	verbal	 port 	 ion 	 	,	there	's	some	serious	magic	.
 some 	 where 	 	 hid 	 den 	 	in	the	physical	 gest 	 ures 	 	,	the	vocal	 cad 	 ence 	 	,	the	 fa 	 cial 	 	 express 	 ions 	 	,	the	eye	contact	,	the	 pass 	 ion 	 	,	the	kind	of	awkward	,	british	body	language	,	the	sense	of	how	the	audience	are	 react 	 ing 	 	,	there	are	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 sub 	 conscious 	 	 clue 	 s 	 	that	go	to	how	well	you	will	understand	,	and	 whet 	 her 	 	you	're	inspired	--	light	,	if	you	like	,	and	 desir 	 e 	 	.
 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	,	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	can	be	 communicate 	 d 	 	on	just	a	few	square	 inch 	 es 	 	of	a	screen	.
 read 	 ing 	 	and	writing	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 relat 	 ively 	 	 re 	 cent 	 	 invent 	 ions 	 	.
face	-	to	-	face	communication	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	fine	-	tuned	by	 million 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	of	evolution	.
that	's	what	's	made	it	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 myster 	 ious 	 	,	 power 	 ful 	 	thing	it	is	.
 some 	 one 	 	 speak 	 s 	 	,	there	's	 reson 	 ance 	 	in	all	these	 receiv 	 ing 	 	 brain 	 s 	 	,	the	whole	group	 act 	 s 	 	together	.
i	mean	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 connect 	 ive 	 	tissue	of	the	human	 super 	 organism 	 	in	action	.
it	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	driven	our	culture	for	millennia	.
500	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	it	ran	 in 	 to 	 	a	competitor	with	a	lethal	advantage	.
it	's	right	here	.
print	 scale 	 d 	 	.
the	world	's	 ambit 	 ious 	 	 innov 	 ators 	 	and	 influence 	 rs 	 	now	could	get	 the 	 ir 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	to	spread	far	and	wide	,	and	so	the	art	of	the	spoken	word	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 with 	 er 	 ed 	 	on	the	vine	.
but	now	,	in	the	blink	of	an	eye	,	the	game	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
it	's	not	too	much	to	say	that	what	gutenberg	did	for	writing	,	 on 	 line 	 	video	can	now	do	for	face	-	to	-	face	communication	.
so	,	that	 prim 	 al 	 	medium	,	which	your	brain	is	 exquisite 	 ly 	 	wired	for	...
that	just	went	global	.
now	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	big	.
we	may	have	to	 re 	 invent 	 	an	ancient	art	form	.
i	mean	,	 to 	 day 	 	,	one	person	 s 	 peaking 	 	can	be	 s 	 een 	 	by	 million 	 s 	 	,	 shed 	 d 	 ing 	 	bright	light	on	potent	 idea 	 s 	 	,	creating	 intens 	 e 	 	 desir 	 e 	 	for	 learn 	 ing 	 	and	to	respond	--	and	in	his	case	,	 intens 	 e 	 	 desir 	 e 	 	to	laugh	.
for	the	first	time	in	human	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	 talent 	 ed 	 	 student 	 s 	 	do	n't	have	to	have	 the 	 ir 	 	potential	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 dream 	 s 	 	written	out	of	 histo 	 ry 	 	by	 lous 	 y 	 	 teacher 	 s 	 	.
they	can	 s 	 it 	 	two	feet	in	front	of	the	world	's	 fin 	 est 	 	.
now	,	ted	is	just	a	small	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	mean	,	the	world	's	 un 	 ive 	 rs 	 ities 	 	are	 open 	 ing 	 	up	 the 	 ir 	 	 curr 	 ic 	 ula 	 	.
 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 individual 	 s 	 	and	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	are	sharing	 the 	 ir 	 	knowledge	and	data	 on 	 line 	 	.
 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	are	 figur 	 ing 	 	out	new	ways	to	learn	and	,	 cruci 	 ally 	 	,	to	respond	,	 comple 	 ting 	 	the	cycle	.
and	so	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	've	thought	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	know	,	it	's	 be 	 come 	 	clear	to	us	what	the	next	stage	of	ted	's	evolution	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	.
tedtalks	ca	n't	be	a	one	-	way	process	,	one	-	to	-	 man 	 y 	 	.
our	future	is	 man 	 y 	 	-	to	-	 man 	 y 	 	.
so	,	we	're	 dream 	 ing 	 	of	ways	to	make	it	 eas 	 ier 	 	for	you	,	the	global	ted	community	,	to	respond	to	 speaker 	 s 	 	,	to	 con 	 tribute 	 	your	own	 idea 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	even	your	own	tedtalks	,	and	to	help	shine	a	light	on	the	 ver 	 y 	 	best	of	what	's	out	there	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	if	we	can	bubble	up	the	 ver 	 y 	 	best	from	a	 vast 	 ly 	 	 large 	 r 	 	pool	,	 th 	 is 	 	wheel	 turn 	 s 	 	.
now	,	is	it	possible	to	imagine	a	similar	process	to	 th 	 is 	 	,	 happen 	 ing 	 	to	global	education	 over 	 all 	 	?
i	mean	,	 do 	 es 	 	it	have	to	be	 th 	 is 	 	 pain 	 ful 	 	,	top	-	down	process	?
why	not	a	self	-	 fuel 	 ing 	 	cycle	in	which	we	all	can	 particip 	 ate 	 	?
it	's	the	 particip 	 ation 	 	age	,	right	?
 school 	 s 	 	ca	n't	be	 s 	 ilo 	 s 	 	.
we	ca	n't	stop	 learn 	 ing 	 	at	age	21	.
what	if	,	in	the	coming	crowd	of	nine	billion	...
what	if	that	crowd	could	learn	 en 	 ough 	 	to	be	net	 contributor 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	net	 plunder 	 ers 	 	?
that	 change 	 s 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	,	right	?
i	mean	,	that	would	take	more	 teacher 	 s 	 	than	we	've	ever	had	.
but	the	good	news	is	they	are	out	there	.
they	're	in	the	crowd	,	and	the	crowd	is	 s 	 witch 	 ing 	 	on	 light 	 s 	 	,	and	we	can	see	them	for	the	first	time	,	not	 a 	 s 	 	an	 un 	 different 	 iated 	 	mass	of	 strange 	 rs 	 	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	we	can	learn	from	.
who	's	the	teacher	?
you	're	the	teacher	.
you	're	part	of	the	crowd	that	may	be	about	to	launch	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	cycle	in	human	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	a	cycle	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 carry 	 ing 	 	all	of	us	to	a	 smart 	 er 	 	,	 wis 	 er 	 	,	more	 beaut 	 iful 	 	place	.
here	's	a	group	of	 kid 	 s 	 	in	a	village	in	pakistan	near	where	i	grew	up	.
 with 	 in 	 	five	 year 	 s 	 	,	each	of	these	 kid 	 s 	 	is	going	to	have	access	to	a	 cell 	 phone 	 	 cap 	 able 	 	of	full	-	on	web	video	and	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 upload 	 ing 	 	video	to	the	web	.
i	mean	,	is	it	crazy	to	think	that	 th 	 is 	 	girl	,	in	the	back	,	at	the	right	,	in	15	 year 	 s 	 	,	might	be	sharing	the	idea	that	 keep 	 s 	 	the	world	 beaut 	 iful 	 	for	your	 grand 	 children 	 	?
it	's	not	crazy	;	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	right	now	.
i	want	to	 introduc 	 e 	 	you	to	a	good	friend	of	ted	who	just	 happen 	 s 	 	to	live	in	africa	's	 big 	 gest 	 	 shanty 	 town 	 	.

change	 happen 	 s 	 	when	we	see	 thing 	 s 	 	in	a	different	way	.
 to 	 day 	 	,	i	see	kibera	in	a	different	way	.
my	 mess 	 age 	 	to	tedglobal	and	the	entire	world	is	:	kibera	is	a	 hot 	 bed 	 	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	and	 idea 	 s 	 	.
