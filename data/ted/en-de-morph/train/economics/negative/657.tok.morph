i	'm	dr.	david	hanson	,	and	i	build	 robot 	 s 	 	with	character	.
and	by	that	,	i	mean	that	i	develop	 robot 	 s 	 	that	are	 character 	 s 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 robot 	 s 	 	that	will	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	come	to	 empath 	 ize 	 	with	you	.
so	we	're	 start 	 ing 	 	with	a	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 techno 	 logies 	 	that	have	 converg 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	these	 conversation 	 al 	 	character	 robot 	 s 	 	that	can	see	 face 	 s 	 	,	make	eye	contact	with	you	,	make	a	full	range	of	 fa 	 cial 	 	 express 	 ions 	 	,	understand	speech	and	begin	to	model	how	you	're	 feel 	 ing 	 	and	who	you	are	,	and	build	a	relationship	with	you	.
i	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 techno 	 logies 	 	that	 allow 	 ed 	 	the	 robot 	 s 	 	to	make	more	realistic	 fa 	 cial 	 	 express 	 ions 	 	than	 previous 	 ly 	 	 achiev 	 ed 	 	,	on	lower	power	,	which	enabled	the	 walk 	 ing 	 	 bi 	 ped 	 	 robot 	 s 	 	,	the	first	 and 	 roid 	 s 	 	.
so	,	it	's	a	full	range	of	 fa 	 cial 	 	 express 	 ions 	 	 simul 	 ating 	 	all	the	major	 muscle 	 s 	 	in	the	human	face	,	running	on	 ver 	 y 	 	small	 batt 	 eries 	 	,	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 light 	 weight 	 	.
the	 material 	 s 	 	that	 allow 	 ed 	 	the	 batt 	 ery 	 	-	 oper 	 ated 	 	 fa 	 cial 	 	 express 	 ions 	 	is	a	material	that	we	call	frubber	,	and	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	three	major	 innov 	 ations 	 	in	the	material	that	allow	 th 	 is 	 	to	happen	.
one	is	 hierarch 	 ical 	 	 pore 	 s 	 	,	and	the	other	is	a	macro	-	 mole 	 cular 	 	 nano 	 scale 	 	porosity	in	the	material	.
there	he	's	 start 	 ing 	 	to	walk	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	at	the	korean	 advance 	 d 	 	institute	of	science	and	technology	.
i	built	the	head	.	they	built	the	body	.
so	the	goal	here	is	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	 senti 	 ence 	 	in	 machine 	 s 	 	,	and	not	just	 senti 	 ence 	 	,	but	 empath 	 y 	 	.
we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	with	the	machine	 per 	 ception 	 	 labor 	 atory 	 	at	the	u.c	.	san	diego	.
they	have	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	 fa 	 cial 	 	 express 	 ion 	 	technology	that	 recogn 	 ize 	 s 	 	 fa 	 cial 	 	 express 	 ions 	 	,	what	 fa 	 cial 	 	 express 	 ions 	 	you	're	making	.
it	 al 	 so 	 	 recogn 	 ize 	 s 	 	where	you	're	looking	,	your	head	 orient 	 ation 	 	.
we	're	 emul 	 ating 	 	all	the	major	 fa 	 cial 	 	 express 	 ions 	 	,	and	then	 controll 	 ing 	 	it	with	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	that	we	call	the	character	engine	.
and	here	is	a	little	bit	of	the	technology	that	's	 involve 	 d 	 	in	that	.
in	fact	,	right	now	--	plug	it	from	here	,	and	then	plug	it	in	here	,	and	now	let	's	see	if	it	 get 	 s 	 	my	 fa 	 cial 	 	 express 	 ions 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	so	i	'm	 smil 	 ing 	 	.
now	i	'm	 frown 	 ing 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 heav 	 ily 	 	 back 	 lit 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	here	we	go	.
oh	,	it	's	so	 s 	 ad 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	you	 s 	 mile 	 	,	 frown 	 ing 	 	.
so	his	 per 	 ception 	 	of	your	 emotion 	 al 	 	 state 	 s 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	for	 machine 	 s 	 	to	 effective 	 ly 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 em 	 pathetic 	 	.
 machine 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 coming 	 	devastatingly	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 kill 	 ing 	 	.	right	?
 t 	 hose 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	have	no	place	for	 empath 	 y 	 	.
and	there	is	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 pent 	 	on	that	.
character	 robotic 	 s 	 	could	plant	the	seed	for	 robot 	 s 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	 empath 	 y 	 	.
so	,	if	they	 achiev 	 e 	 	human	level	 intellig 	 ence 	 	or	,	 quit 	 e 	 	possibly	,	 great 	 er 	 	than	human	 level 	 s 	 	of	 intellig 	 ence 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	could	be	the	 seed 	 s 	 	of	hope	for	our	future	.
so	,	we	've	made	20	 robot 	 s 	 	in	the	last	eight	 year 	 s 	 	,	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	course	of	 get 	 ting 	 	my	ph.d	.
and	then	i	 start 	 ed 	 	hanson	 robotic 	 s 	 	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 develop 	 ing 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	for	mass	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	our	 robot 	 s 	 	that	we	 show 	 ed 	 	at	wired	nextfest	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
and	it	 s 	 ees 	 	 multi 	 ple 	 	people	in	a	scene	,	 remember 	 s 	 	where	individual	people	are	,	and	 look 	 s 	 	from	person	to	person	,	 remember 	 ing 	 	people	.
so	,	we	're	 in 	 vol 	 v 	 ing 	 	two	 thing 	 s 	 	.
one	,	the	 per 	 ception 	 	of	people	,	and	two	,	the	natural	 inter 	 face 	 	,	the	natural	form	of	the	 inter 	 face 	 	,	so	that	it	's	more	intuitive	for	you	to	interact	with	the	robot	.
you	start	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	it	's	 al 	 ive 	 	and	aware	.
so	one	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 project 	 s 	 	was	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	together	in	an	 art 	 istic 	 	 dis 	 play 	 	of	an	android	portrait	of	science	-	fiction	writer	philip	k.	 d 	 ick 	 	,	who	wrote	great	 work 	 s 	 	like	,	``	do	 and 	 roid 	 s 	 	dream	of	electric	sheep	?	``
which	was	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	the	movie	``	bladerunner	.	``
in	these	 st 	 ories 	 	,	 robot 	 s 	 	often	think	that	they	're	human	,	and	they	sort	of	come	to	life	.
so	we	put	his	 writing 	 s 	 	,	 letter 	 s 	 	,	his	 interview 	 s 	 	,	correspondences	,	 in 	 to 	 	a	huge	 data 	 base 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 page 	 s 	 	,	and	then	used	some	natural	language	 process 	 ing 	 	to	allow	you	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	a	conversation	with	him	.
and	it	was	kind	of	 s 	 pooky 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	would	say	these	 thing 	 s 	 	that	just	 sound 	 ed 	 	like	they	 re 	 ally 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	you	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	most	 excit 	 ing 	 	 project 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 develop 	 ing 	 	,	which	is	a	little	character	that	's	a	spokesbot	for	friendly	artificial	 intellig 	 ence 	 	,	friendly	machine	 intellig 	 ence 	 	.
and	we	're	 get 	 ting 	 	 th 	 is 	 	mass	-	 manufactur 	 ed 	 	.
we	specked	it	out	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	 do 	 able 	 	with	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	low	-	cost	bill	of	 material 	 s 	 	,	so	that	it	can	 be 	 come 	 	a	 child 	 hood 	 	companion	for	 kid 	 s 	 	.
interfacing	with	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	it	 get 	 s 	 	 smart 	 er 	 	over	the	 year 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	artificial	 intellig 	 ence 	 	 evolve 	 s 	 	,	so	 do 	 es 	 	his	 intellig 	 ence 	 	.
chris	anderson	:	thank	you	so	much	.	that	's	 in 	 credible 	 	.
