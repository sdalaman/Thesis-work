i	'm	not	married	,	but	one	year	ago	 to 	 day 	 	,	i	 wok 	 e 	 	up	from	a	month	-	long	 com 	 a 	 	,	 follow 	 ing 	 	a	double	lung	transplant	.
crazy	,	i	know	.	 insan 	 e 	 	.
thank	you	.
six	 year 	 s 	 	before	that	,	i	was	 start 	 ing 	 	my	 care 	 er 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	opera	 s 	 ing 	 er 	 	in	europe	,	when	i	was	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	with	 idi 	 opathic 	 	 pul 	 mon 	 ary 	 	 hyper 	 tension 	 	--	 al 	 so 	 	known	 a 	 s 	 	ph	.
it	 happen 	 s 	 	when	there	's	a	 thick 	 en 	 ing 	 	in	the	 pul 	 mon 	 ary 	 	 vein 	 s 	 	,	making	the	right	side	of	the	heart	work	 over 	 time 	 	,	and	 caus 	 ing 	 	what	i	call	the	reverse	-	grinch	effect	.
my	heart	was	three	-	and	-	a	-	half	 s 	 ize 	 s 	 	too	big	.
physical	activity	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	for	people	with	 th 	 is 	 	condition	,	and	 usual 	 ly 	 	after	two	to	five	 year 	 s 	 	,	you	die	.
i	went	to	see	 th 	 is 	 	 special 	 ist 	 	,	and	she	was	top	-	of	-	the	-	field	and	told	me	i	had	to	stop	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	.
she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 t 	 hose 	 	high	 note 	 s 	 	are	going	to	kill	you	.	``
while	she	did	n't	have	any	medical	evidence	to	back	up	her	claim	that	there	was	a	relationship	between	 opera 	 tic 	 	 aria 	 s 	 	and	 pul 	 mon 	 ary 	 	 hyper 	 tension 	 	,	she	was	 absolute 	 ly 	 	emphatic	i	was	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	my	own	 o 	 bit 	 uary 	 	.
i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 limit 	 ed 	 	by	my	condition	,	 physical 	 ly 	 	.
but	i	was	not	 limit 	 ed 	 	when	i	 s 	 ang 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	air	came	up	from	my	 lung 	 s 	 	,	through	my	vocal	 cord 	 s 	 	and	 pass 	 ed 	 	my	lips	 a 	 s 	 	sound	,	it	was	the	 close 	 st 	 	thing	i	had	ever	come	to	 transcend 	 ence 	 	.
and	just	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 some 	 one 	 	's	hunch	,	i	was	n't	going	to	give	it	up	.
 thank 	 fully 	 	,	i	met	reda	girgis	,	who	is	dry	 a 	 s 	 	toast	,	but	he	and	his	team	at	johns	hopkins	did	n't	just	want	me	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	,	they	 want 	 ed 	 	me	to	live	a	 meaning 	 ful 	 	life	.
 th 	 is 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	making	trade	-	offs	.
i	come	from	colorado	.
it	's	a	mile	high	,	and	i	grew	up	there	with	my	10	 brother 	 s 	 	and	 sister 	 s 	 	and	two	 ador 	 ing 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	.
well	,	the	altitude	 exacerbate 	 d 	 	my	 symptom 	 s 	 	.
so	i	 move 	 d 	 	to	baltimore	to	be	near	my	 doctor 	 s 	 	and	 enroll 	 ed 	 	in	a	 conserv 	 atory 	 	 near 	 by 	 	.
i	could	n't	walk	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	i	used	to	,	so	i	 opt 	 ed 	 	for	five	-	inch	 heel 	 s 	 	.
and	i	 g 	 ave 	 	up	salt	,	i	went	 vega 	 n 	 	,	and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	taking	huge	 dose 	 s 	 	of	sildenafil	,	 al 	 so 	 	known	 a 	 s 	 	viagra	.
my	father	and	my	 grand 	 father 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	looking	for	the	 new 	 est 	 	thing	in	 alter 	 native 	 	or	 tradition 	 al 	 	 ther 	 a 	 pies 	 	for	ph	,	but	after	six	 month 	 s 	 	,	i	could	n't	walk	up	a	small	hill	.	i	could	n't	climb	a	flight	of	 stair 	 s 	 	.
i	could	 bare 	 ly 	 	stand	up	 with 	 out 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	like	i	was	going	to	faint	.
i	had	a	heart	 catheter 	 ization 	 	,	where	they	measure	 th 	 is 	 	internal	 arteri 	 al 	 	 pul 	 mon 	 ary 	 	pressure	,	which	is	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	between	15	and	20	.
mine	was	146	.
i	like	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	big	,	and	it	 me 	 ant 	 	one	thing	:	there	is	a	big	gun	 treat 	 ment 	 	for	 pul 	 mon 	 ary 	 	 hyper 	 tension 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	flolan	,	and	it	's	not	just	a	drug	;	it	's	a	way	of	life	.
 doctor 	 s 	 	insert	a	catheter	 in 	 to 	 	your	chest	,	which	is	 attach 	 ed 	 	to	a	pump	that	 weigh 	 s 	 	about	four	-	and	-	a	-	half	 pound 	 s 	 	.
every	day	,	24	 hour 	 s 	 	,	that	pump	is	at	your	side	,	 administer 	 ing 	 	medicine	 direct 	 ly 	 	to	your	heart	,	and	it	's	not	a	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 prefer 	 able 	 	medicine	in	 man 	 y 	 	 sense 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	list	of	the	side	 effect 	 s 	 	:	if	you	eat	too	much	salt	,	like	a	peanut	butter	and	jelly	sandwich	,	you	'll	 prob 	 ably 	 	end	up	in	the	icu	.
if	you	go	through	a	metal	 detect 	 or 	 	,	you	'll	 prob 	 ably 	 	die	.
if	you	get	a	bubble	in	your	medicine	--	 be 	 cause 	 	you	have	to	mix	it	every	 morn 	 ing 	 	--	and	it	 stay 	 s 	 	in	there	,	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	die	.
if	you	run	out	of	medicine	,	you	 definite 	 ly 	 	die	.
no	one	 want 	 s 	 	to	go	on	flolan	.
but	when	i	 need 	 ed 	 	it	,	it	was	a	 god 	 s 	 end 	 	.
 with 	 in 	 	a	few	 day 	 s 	 	,	i	could	walk	 aga 	 in 	 	.
 with 	 in 	 	a	few	 week 	 s 	 	,	i	was	 perform 	 ing 	 	,	and	in	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	,	i	 debut 	 ed 	 	at	the	kennedy	center	.
the	pump	was	a	little	bit	 problem 	 atic 	 	when	 perform 	 ing 	 	,	so	i	'd	attach	it	to	my	inner	 t 	 high 	 	with	the	help	of	the	 gird 	 le 	 	and	an	ace	 band 	 age 	 	.
 liter 	 ally 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 elev 	 ator 	 	 ride 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 pent 	 	with	me	 al 	 one 	 	 stuff 	 ing 	 	the	pump	 in 	 to 	 	my	spanx	,	 hop 	 ing 	 	the	 door 	 s 	 	would	n't	open	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 ly 	 	.
and	the	 tub 	 ing 	 	coming	out	of	my	chest	was	a	nightmare	for	 cost 	 ume 	 	 design 	 ers 	 	.
i	 graduate 	 d 	 	from	graduate	school	in	2006	,	and	i	got	a	 fellow 	 ship 	 	to	go	back	to	europe	.
a	few	 day 	 s 	 	after	 arriv 	 ing 	 	,	i	met	 th 	 is 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	,	old	conductor	who	 start 	 ed 	 	 cast 	 ing 	 	me	in	all	of	these	 role 	 s 	 	.
and	before	long	,	i	was	 com 	 mut 	 ing 	 	between	budapest	,	milan	and	florence	.
 th 	 ough 	 	i	was	 attach 	 ed 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	 ug 	 ly 	 	,	 un 	 want 	 ed 	 	,	high	-	maintenance	,	 mechanic 	 al 	 	pet	,	my	life	was	kind	of	like	the	happy	part	in	an	opera	--	 ver 	 y 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	,	but	in	a	good	way	.
then	in	february	of	2008	,	my	 grand 	 father 	 	 pass 	 ed 	 	away	.
he	was	a	big	figure	in	all	of	our	 live 	 s 	 	,	and	we	 love 	 d 	 	him	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
it	 certain 	 ly 	 	did	n't	 prep 	 are 	 	me	for	what	came	next	.
seven	 week 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	i	got	a	call	from	my	family	.
my	father	had	 be 	 en 	 	in	a	 catastroph 	 ic 	 	car	accident	,	and	he	 di 	 ed 	 	.
at	24	,	my	death	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	 entire 	 ly 	 	 expect 	 ed 	 	.
but	his	--	well	,	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	i	can	articulate	how	it	felt	was	that	it	 precipit 	 ated 	 	my	medical	decline	.
against	my	 doctor 	 s 	 	'	and	family	's	 wish 	 es 	 	,	i	 need 	 ed 	 	to	go	back	for	the	funeral	.
i	had	to	say	 good 	 bye 	 	in	some	way	,	shape	or	form	.
but	soon	i	was	 show 	 ing 	 	 sign 	 s 	 	of	right	-	heart	failure	,	and	i	had	to	return	to	sea	level	,	 do 	 ing 	 	so	 know 	 ing 	 	that	i	 prob 	 ably 	 	would	never	see	my	home	 aga 	 in 	 	.
i	 cancel 	 ed 	 	most	of	my	 engage 	 ments 	 	that	summer	,	but	i	had	one	left	in	tel	aviv	,	so	i	went	.
after	one	performance	,	i	could	 bare 	 ly 	 	drag	 my 	 self 	 	from	the	stage	to	the	 taxi 	 cab 	 	.
i	 s 	 at 	 	down	and	felt	the	blood	rush	down	from	my	face	,	and	in	the	heat	of	the	desert	,	i	was	freezing	cold	.
my	 finger 	 s 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	 turn 	 ing 	 	blue	,	and	i	was	like	,	``	what	is	going	on	here	?	``
i	heard	my	heart	's	 val 	 ves 	 	 snap 	 ping 	 	open	and	closed	.
the	cab	 stop 	 ped 	 	,	and	i	 pull 	 ed 	 	my	body	from	it	 feel 	 ing 	 	each	ounce	of	weight	 a 	 s 	 	i	 walk 	 ed 	 	to	the	 elev 	 ator 	 	.
i	fell	through	my	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	door	and	 crawl 	 ed 	 	to	the	 bath 	 room 	 	where	i	found	my	problem	:	i	had	 for 	 gotten 	 	to	mix	in	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	part	of	my	medicine	.
i	was	 dy 	 ing 	 	,	and	if	i	did	n't	mix	that	stuff	up	fast	,	i	would	never	 leav 	 e 	 	that	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	 al 	 ive 	 	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	 mix 	 ing 	 	,	and	i	felt	like	 every 	 thing 	 	was	going	to	fall	out	through	one	hole	or	 an 	 other 	 	,	but	i	just	 ke 	 pt 	 	on	going	.
 final 	 ly 	 	,	with	the	last	bottle	in	and	the	last	bubble	out	,	i	 attach 	 ed 	 	the	pump	to	the	 tub 	 ing 	 	and	lay	there	 hop 	 ing 	 	it	would	kick	in	soon	 en 	 ough 	 	.
if	it	did	n't	,	i	'd	 prob 	 ably 	 	see	my	father	 soon 	 er 	 	than	i	 anticip 	 ated 	 	.
 thank 	 fully 	 	,	in	a	few	 minute 	 s 	 	,	i	saw	the	signature	hive	-	like	rash	appear	on	my	 leg 	 s 	 	,	which	is	a	side	effect	of	the	 medic 	 ation 	 	,	and	i	 k 	 new 	 	i	'd	be	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
we	're	not	big	on	fear	in	my	family	,	but	i	was	 scar 	 ed 	 	.
i	went	back	to	the	 state 	 s 	 	,	 anticip 	 ating 	 	i	'd	return	to	europe	,	but	the	heart	 catheter 	 ization 	 	 show 	 ed 	 	that	i	was	n't	going	 any 	 where 	 	further	that	a	flight	-	for	-	life	from	johns	hopkins	hospital	.
i	 perform 	 ed 	 	here	and	there	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	my	condition	 deterio 	 rated 	 	,	so	did	my	voice	.
my	doctor	 want 	 ed 	 	me	to	get	on	the	list	for	a	lung	transplant	.
i	did	n't	.
i	had	two	 friend 	 s 	 	who	had	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 di 	 ed 	 	 month 	 s 	 	after	 hav 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 challeng 	 ing 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ries 	 	.
i	 k 	 new 	 	 an 	 other 	 	young	man	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	who	had	ph	who	 di 	 ed 	 	while	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	one	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	live	.
i	thought	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	a	good	option	,	but	they	had	n't	 develop 	 ed 	 	to	a	point	where	i	could	take	advantage	of	them	yet	.
i	 official 	 ly 	 	took	a	break	from	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	,	and	i	went	to	the	cleveland	clinic	to	be	 re 	 evaluate 	 d 	 	for	the	third	time	in	five	 year 	 s 	 	,	for	transplant	.
i	was	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	kind	of	 un 	 enthusiast 	 ically 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	with	the	head	transplant	surgeon	,	and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	him	if	i	 need 	 ed 	 	a	transplant	,	what	i	could	do	to	 prep 	 are 	 	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	be	happy	.
a	happy	patient	is	a	 health 	 y 	 	patient	.	``
it	was	like	in	one	verbal	swoop	he	had	 channel 	 ed 	 	my	 thought 	 s 	 	on	life	and	medicine	and	confucius	.
i	still	did	n't	want	a	transplant	,	but	in	a	month	,	i	was	back	in	the	hospital	with	some	 severe 	 ly 	 	 e 	 demic 	 	 k 	 ankle 	 s 	 	--	 ver 	 y 	 	 attract 	 ive 	 	.
and	it	was	right	-	heart	failure	.
i	 final 	 ly 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	it	was	time	to	take	my	doctor	's	 ad 	 vice 	 	.
it	was	time	for	me	to	go	to	cleveland	and	to	start	the	 agon 	 izing 	 	wait	for	a	match	.
but	the	next	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	while	i	was	still	in	the	hospital	,	i	got	a	 tele 	 phone 	 	call	.
it	was	my	doctor	in	cleveland	,	marie	budev	.
and	they	had	 lung 	 s 	 	.
it	was	a	match	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	from	texas	.
and	 every 	 body 	 	was	 re 	 ally 	 	happy	for	me	,	but	me	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	 de 	 spite 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	,	i	had	 s 	 pent 	 	my	whole	life	training	my	 lung 	 s 	 	,	and	i	was	not	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 enthusiast 	 ic 	 	about	giving	them	up	.
i	flew	to	cleveland	,	and	my	family	 rush 	 ed 	 	there	in	 hope 	 s 	 	that	they	would	meet	me	and	say	what	we	 k 	 new 	 	might	be	our	final	 good 	 bye 	 	.
but	 organ 	 s 	 	do	n't	wait	,	and	i	went	 in 	 to 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	before	i	could	say	 good 	 bye 	 	.
the	last	thing	i	remember	was	 ly 	 ing 	 	on	a	white	 blank 	 et 	 	,	 tell 	 ing 	 	my	surgeon	that	i	 need 	 ed 	 	to	see	my	mother	 aga 	 in 	 	,	and	to	 pleas 	 e 	 	try	and	 s 	 ave 	 	my	voice	.
i	fell	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 apocalyp 	 tic 	 	dream	world	.
 dur 	 ing 	 	the	thirteen	-	and	-	a	-	half	-	hour	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	,	i	 flat 	 lined 	 	twice	,	40	 quar 	 ts 	 	of	blood	 we 	 re 	 	 in 	 fused 	 	 in 	 to 	 	my	body	.
and	in	my	surgeon	's	20	-	year	 care 	 er 	 	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	it	was	among	the	most	difficult	 transplant 	 s 	 	that	he	's	ever	 perform 	 ed 	 	.
they	left	my	chest	open	for	two	 week 	 s 	 	.
you	could	see	my	over	-	sized	heart	 beat 	 ing 	 	 in 	 side 	 	of	it	.
i	was	on	a	dozen	 machine 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 keep 	 ing 	 	me	 al 	 ive 	 	.
an	 infect 	 ion 	 	 ravage 	 d 	 	my	skin	.
i	had	 hop 	 ed 	 	my	voice	would	be	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	,	but	my	 doctor 	 s 	 	 k 	 new 	 	that	the	 breath 	 ing 	 	 tube 	 s 	 	going	down	my	throat	might	have	 al 	 ready 	 	 destroy 	 ed 	 	it	.
if	they	 stay 	 ed 	 	in	,	there	was	no	way	i	would	ever	 s 	 ing 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
so	my	doctor	got	the	ent	,	the	top	guy	at	the	clinic	,	to	come	down	and	give	me	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	to	move	the	 tube 	 s 	 	around	my	voice	box	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	it	would	kill	me	.
so	my	own	surgeon	 perform 	 ed 	 	the	procedure	in	a	last	-	 d 	 itch 	 	attempt	to	 s 	 ave 	 	my	voice	.
 th 	 ough 	 	my	mom	could	n't	say	 good 	 bye 	 	to	me	before	the	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	,	she	did	n't	 leav 	 e 	 	my	side	in	the	 month 	 s 	 	of	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	that	 follow 	 ed 	 	.
and	if	you	want	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 persever 	 ance 	 	,	grit	and	strength	in	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	little	package	,	it	is	her	.
one	year	ago	to	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	day	,	i	 wok 	 e 	 	up	.
i	was	95	 lb 	 s 	 	.
there	 we 	 re 	 	a	dozen	 tube 	 s 	 	coming	in	and	out	of	my	body	.
i	could	n't	walk	,	i	could	n't	talk	,	i	could	n't	eat	,	i	could	n't	move	,	i	 certain 	 ly 	 	could	n't	 s 	 ing 	 	,	i	could	n't	even	breathe	,	but	when	i	 look 	 ed 	 	up	and	i	saw	my	mother	,	i	could	n't	help	but	 s 	 mile 	 	.
 whet 	 her 	 	by	a	mack	truck	or	by	heart	failure	or	 fault 	 y 	 	 lung 	 s 	 	,	death	 happen 	 s 	 	.
but	life	is	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	just	about	 avoid 	 ing 	 	death	,	is	it	?
it	's	about	living	.
medical	 condition 	 s 	 	do	n't	 neg 	 ate 	 	the	human	condition	.
and	when	people	are	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	pursue	 the 	 ir 	 	 pass 	 ions 	 	,	 doctor 	 s 	 	will	find	they	have	better	,	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	and	 health 	 ier 	 	 patient 	 s 	 	.
my	 parent 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 total 	 ly 	 	 stress 	 ed 	 	out	about	me	going	and	 audition 	 ing 	 	and	 travel 	 ing 	 	and	 perform 	 ing 	 	all	over	the	place	,	but	they	 k 	 new 	 	that	it	was	much	better	for	me	to	do	that	than	be	 pre 	 occupied 	 	with	my	own	 mortal 	 ity 	 	all	of	the	time	.
and	i	'm	so	 grat 	 e 	 ful 	 	they	did	.
 th 	 is 	 	past	summer	,	when	i	was	running	and	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	and	 danc 	 ing 	 	and	 play 	 ing 	 	with	my	 niece 	 s 	 	and	my	 nephew 	 s 	 	and	my	 brother 	 s 	 	and	my	 sister 	 s 	 	and	my	mother	and	my	 grand 	 mother 	 	in	the	colorado	rockies	,	i	could	n't	help	but	think	of	that	doctor	who	told	me	that	i	could	n't	 s 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	tell	her	,	and	i	want	to	tell	you	,	we	need	to	stop	 lett 	 ing 	 	disease	divorce	us	from	our	 dream 	 s 	 	.
when	we	do	,	we	will	find	that	 patient 	 s 	 	do	n't	just	 surviv 	 e 	 	;	we	 thriv 	 e 	 	.
and	some	of	us	might	even	 s 	 ing 	 	.
