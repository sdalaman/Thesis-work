let	me	share	with	you	 to 	 day 	 	an	original	 discover 	 y 	 	.
but	i	want	to	tell	it	to	you	the	way	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	--	not	the	way	i	present	it	in	a	scientific	 meet 	 ing 	 	,	or	the	way	you	'd	read	it	in	a	scientific	paper	.
it	's	a	story	about	beyond	 biomimetic 	 s 	 	,	to	 some 	 thing 	 	i	'm	 call 	 ing 	 	 bio 	 mutual 	 ism 	 	.
i	define	that	 a 	 s 	 	an	 associ 	 ation 	 	between	biology	and	 an 	 other 	 	discipline	,	where	each	discipline	 reciproc 	 ally 	 	 advance 	 s 	 	the	other	,	but	where	the	 collect 	 ive 	 	 discover 	 ies 	 	that	emerge	are	beyond	any	single	field	.
now	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 biomimetic 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	human	 techno 	 logies 	 	take	on	more	of	the	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	of	nature	,	nature	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	much	more	 use 	 ful 	 	teacher	.
 engineer 	 ing 	 	can	be	inspired	by	biology	by	using	 it 	 s 	 	 principle 	 s 	 	and	 analog 	 ies 	 	when	they	're	 advantage 	 ous 	 	,	but	then	 integ 	 rating 	 	that	with	the	best	human	 engineer 	 ing 	 	,	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	to	make	 some 	 thing 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	better	than	nature	.
now	,	 be 	 ing 	 	a	biologist	,	i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 cur 	 ious 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
these	are	gecko	 to 	 es 	 	.
and	we	 wonder 	 ed 	 	how	they	use	these	bizarre	 to 	 es 	 	to	climb	up	a	wall	so	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
we	 discover 	 ed 	 	it	.	and	what	we	found	was	that	they	have	leaf	-	like	 structure 	 s 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 to 	 es 	 	,	with	 million 	 s 	 	of	 tin 	 y 	 	 hair 	 s 	 	that	look	like	a	rug	,	and	each	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 hair 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	the	worst	case	of	split	-	 end 	 s 	 	possible	:	about	100	to	1000	split	 end 	 s 	 	that	are	nano	-	 s 	 ize 	 	.
and	the	individual	 ha 	 s 	 	2	billion	of	these	nano	-	 s 	 ize 	 	split	 end 	 s 	 	.
they	do	n't	stick	by	velcro	or	 su 	 ction 	 	or	glue	.
they	 actual 	 ly 	 	stick	by	 inter 	 mole 	 cular 	 	 force 	 s 	 	 al 	 one 	 	,	van	der	waals	 force 	 s 	 	.
and	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 pleas 	 ed 	 	to	report	to	you	 to 	 day 	 	that	the	first	synthetic	self	-	 clean 	 ing 	 	,	dry	 ad 	 he 	 s 	 ive 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	made	.
from	the	 simpl 	 est 	 	version	in	nature	,	one	branch	,	my	 engineer 	 ing 	 	 collabor 	 ator 	 	,	ron	 fear 	 ing 	 	,	at	berkeley	,	had	made	the	first	synthetic	version	.
and	so	 ha 	 s 	 	my	other	 in 	 credible 	 	 collabor 	 ator 	 	,	mark	cutkosky	,	at	stanford	--	he	made	much	 large 	 r 	 	 hair 	 s 	 	than	the	gecko	,	but	used	the	same	general	 principle 	 s 	 	.
and	here	is	 it 	 s 	 	first	test	.
that	's	kellar	 aut 	 umn 	 	,	my	 form 	 er 	 	ph.d.	student	,	professor	now	at	lewis	and	clark	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	giving	his	first	-	born	child	up	for	 th 	 is 	 	test	.
more	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
man	:	 th 	 is 	 	the	first	time	 some 	 one 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 climb 	 ed 	 	with	it	.
 nar 	 rator 	 	:	lynn	verinsky	,	a	professional	 climb 	 er 	 	,	who	 appear 	 ed 	 	to	be	 brim 	 ming 	 	with	confidence	.
lynn	verinsky	:	 honest 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	going	to	be	 perfect 	 ly 	 	safe	.	it	will	be	 perfect 	 ly 	 	safe	.
man	:	how	do	you	know	?
lynn	verinsky	:	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 li 	 ability 	 	 insur 	 ance 	 	.
 nar 	 rator 	 	:	with	a	mattress	 be 	 low 	 	and	 attach 	 ed 	 	to	a	 safe 	 ty 	 	rope	,	lynn	 beg 	 an 	 	her	60	-	foot	 a 	 s 	 cent 	 	.
lynn	made	it	to	the	top	in	a	perfect	 pair 	 ing 	 	of	hollywood	and	science	.
man	:	so	you	're	the	first	human	 be 	 ing 	 	to	 official 	 ly 	 	 emul 	 ate 	 	a	gecko	.
lynn	verinsky	:	ha	!	 w 	 ow 	 	.	and	what	a	privilege	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	.
robert	full	:	that	's	what	she	did	on	rough	 surface 	 s 	 	.
but	she	 actual 	 ly 	 	used	these	on	smooth	 surface 	 s 	 	--	two	of	them	--	to	climb	up	,	and	pull	 her 	 self 	 	up	.
and	you	can	try	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	lobby	,	and	look	at	the	gecko	-	inspired	material	.
now	the	problem	with	the	 robot 	 s 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	they	ca	n't	get	 un 	 s 	 tuck 	 	,	with	the	material	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	gecko	's	solution	.	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	peel	 the 	 ir 	 	 to 	 es 	 	away	from	the	surface	,	at	high	rates	,	 a 	 s 	 	they	run	up	the	wall	.
well	i	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	 to 	 day 	 	to	show	you	the	 new 	 est 	 	version	of	a	robot	,	stickybot	,	using	a	new	 hierarch 	 ical 	 	dry	 ad 	 he 	 s 	 ive 	 	.
here	is	the	actual	robot	.
and	here	is	what	it	 do 	 es 	 	.
and	if	you	look	,	you	can	see	that	it	uses	the	 to 	 e 	 	 peel 	 ing 	 	,	just	like	the	gecko	 do 	 es 	 	.
if	we	can	show	some	of	the	video	,	you	can	see	it	 climb 	 ing 	 	up	the	wall	.
there	it	is	.
and	now	it	can	go	on	other	 surface 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	new	 ad 	 he 	 s 	 ive 	 	that	the	stanford	group	was	able	to	do	in	 design 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	robot	.
oh	.	one	thing	i	want	to	point	out	is	,	look	at	stickybot	.
you	see	 some 	 thing 	 	on	it	.	it	's	not	just	to	look	like	a	gecko	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	tail	.	and	just	when	you	think	you	've	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	nature	,	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	thing	 happen 	 s 	 	.
the	 engineer 	 s 	 	told	us	,	for	the	 climb 	 ing 	 	 robot 	 s 	 	,	that	,	if	they	do	n't	have	a	tail	,	they	fall	off	the	wall	.
so	what	they	did	was	they	 ask 	 ed 	 	us	an	 import 	 ant 	 	question	.
they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	it	kind	of	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	tail	.	``
even	 th 	 ough 	 	we	put	a	 pass 	 ive 	 	bar	there	.
``	do	 animal 	 s 	 	use	 the 	 ir 	 	 tail 	 s 	 	when	they	climb	up	 wall 	 s 	 	?	``
what	they	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	was	 return 	 ing 	 	the	favor	,	by	giving	us	a	 hypo 	 thesis 	 	to	test	,	in	biology	,	that	we	would	n't	have	thought	of	.
so	of	course	,	in	 re 	 ality 	 	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	then	 panic 	 ked 	 	,	 be 	 ing 	 	the	 biologist 	 s 	 	,	and	we	should	know	 th 	 is 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	.
we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	what	do	 tail 	 s 	 	do	?	``
well	we	know	that	 tail 	 s 	 	store	fat	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
we	know	that	you	can	grab	onto	 thing 	 s 	 	with	them	.
and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	it	is	most	well	known	that	they	provide	static	balance	.
it	can	 al 	 so 	 	act	 a 	 s 	 	a	 counter 	 balance 	 	.
so	watch	 th 	 is 	 	kangaroo	.
see	that	tail	?	that	's	 in 	 credible 	 	!
marc	raibert	built	a	uniroo	 hop 	 ping 	 	robot	.
and	it	was	 un 	 s 	 table 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 it 	 s 	 	tail	.
now	 most 	 ly 	 	 tail 	 s 	 	limit	 maneuver 	 ability 	 	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	human	 in 	 side 	 	 th 	 is 	 	dinosaur	suit	.
my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	went	on	to	test	 th 	 is 	 	 limit 	 ation 	 	,	by	increasing	the	moment	of	 in 	 ertia 	 	of	a	student	,	so	they	had	a	tail	,	and	running	them	through	and	obstacle	course	,	and	found	a	 decr 	 ement 	 	in	performance	,	like	you	'd	predict	.
but	of	course	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 pass 	 ive 	 	tail	.
and	you	can	 al 	 so 	 	have	active	 tail 	 s 	 	.
and	when	i	went	back	to	research	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	one	of	the	great	ted	 moment 	 s 	 	in	the	past	,	from	nathan	,	we	've	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	an	active	tail	.
video	:	myhrvold	 think 	 s 	 	tail	-	 crack 	 ing 	 	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	love	,	not	war	.
robert	full	:	he	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	the	tail	 be 	 ing 	 	a	whip	for	communication	.
it	can	 al 	 so 	 	be	used	in	defense	.
 pre 	 tty 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	.
so	we	then	went	back	and	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	animal	.
and	we	ran	it	up	a	surface	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	time	what	we	did	is	we	put	a	 slip 	 per 	 y 	 	patch	that	you	see	in	yellow	there	.
and	watch	on	the	right	what	the	animal	is	 do 	 ing 	 	with	 it 	 s 	 	tail	when	it	 slip 	 s 	 	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 s 	 low 	 ed 	 	down	10	 time 	 s 	 	.
so	here	is	normal	speed	.
and	watch	it	now	slip	,	and	see	what	it	 do 	 es 	 	with	 it 	 s 	 	tail	.
it	 ha 	 s 	 	an	active	tail	that	 function 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	fifth	leg	,	and	it	 con 	 tribute 	 s 	 	to	 st 	 ability 	 	.
if	you	make	it	slip	a	huge	amount	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	 discover 	 ed 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	 in 	 credible 	 	.
the	 engineer 	 s 	 	had	a	 re 	 ally 	 	good	idea	.
and	then	of	course	we	 wonder 	 ed 	 	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	they	have	an	active	tail	,	but	let	's	picture	them	.
they	're	 climb 	 ing 	 	up	a	wall	,	or	a	tree	.
and	they	get	to	the	top	and	let	's	say	there	's	some	 leav 	 es 	 	there	.
and	what	would	happen	if	they	 climb 	 ed 	 	on	the	 under 	 side 	 	of	that	leaf	,	and	there	was	some	wind	,	or	we	 s 	 hook 	 	it	?
and	we	did	that	experiment	,	that	you	see	here	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	 discover 	 ed 	 	.
now	that	's	real	time	.	you	ca	n't	see	 any 	 thing 	 	.
but	there	it	is	 s 	 low 	 ed 	 	down	.
what	we	 discover 	 ed 	 	was	the	world	's	 fast 	 est 	 	air	-	 right 	 ing 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	.
for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	remember	your	physics	,	that	's	a	zero	-	angular	-	 moment 	 um 	 	 right 	 ing 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	.	but	it	's	like	a	cat	.
you	know	,	 cat 	 s 	 	 fall 	 ing 	 	.	 cat 	 s 	 	do	 th 	 is 	 	.	they	twist	 the 	 ir 	 	bodies	.
but	 gecko 	 s 	 	do	it	better	.
and	they	do	it	with	 the 	 ir 	 	tail	.
so	they	do	it	with	 th 	 is 	 	active	tail	 a 	 s 	 	they	 s 	 wing 	 	around	.
and	then	they	 al 	 ways 	 	land	in	the	sort	of	 super 	 man 	 	 sky 	 div 	 ing 	 	 post 	 ure 	 	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	now	we	 wonder 	 ed 	 	,	if	we	 we 	 re 	 	right	,	we	should	be	able	to	test	 th 	 is 	 	in	a	physical	model	,	in	a	robot	.
so	for	ted	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	built	a	robot	,	over	there	,	a	prototype	,	with	the	tail	.
and	we	're	going	to	attempt	the	first	air	-	 right 	 ing 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	in	a	tail	,	with	a	robot	.
if	we	could	have	the	 light 	 s 	 	on	it	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	there	it	 go 	 es 	 	.
and	show	the	video	.
there	it	is	.
and	it	 work 	 s 	 	just	like	it	 do 	 es 	 	in	the	animal	.
so	all	you	need	is	a	 s 	 wing 	 	of	the	tail	to	right	 your 	 self 	 	.
now	,	of	course	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 normal 	 ly 	 	 frighten 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	animal	 ha 	 s 	 	no	gliding	 adapt 	 ations 	 	,	so	we	thought	,	``	oh	that	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	we	'll	put	it	in	a	 vert 	 ical 	 	wind	tunnel	.
we	'll	blow	the	air	up	,	we	'll	give	it	a	 land 	 ing 	 	target	,	a	tree	trunk	,	just	 out 	 side 	 	the	plexi	-	glass	 en 	 closure 	 	,	and	see	what	it	 do 	 es 	 	.
so	we	did	.	and	here	is	what	it	 do 	 es 	 	.
so	the	wind	is	coming	from	the	bottom	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 s 	 low 	 ed 	 	down	10	 time 	 s 	 	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	an	equilibrium	glide	.	 high 	 ly 	 	controlled	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	sort	of	 in 	 credible 	 	.	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	when	you	take	a	picture	of	it	.
and	it	's	better	than	that	,	it	--	just	in	the	slide	--	 maneuver 	 s 	 	in	mid	-	air	.
and	the	way	it	 do 	 es 	 	it	,	is	it	 take 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	tail	and	it	 s 	 wing 	 s 	 	it	one	way	to	yaw	left	,	and	it	 s 	 wing 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	other	way	to	yaw	right	.
so	we	can	maneuver	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
and	then	--	we	had	to	film	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 time 	 s 	 	to	 believ 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	--	it	 al 	 so 	 	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.	watch	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	 oscill 	 ates 	 	 it 	 s 	 	tail	up	and	down	like	a	dolphin	.
it	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	swim	through	the	air	.
but	watch	 it 	 s 	 	front	 leg 	 s 	 	.	can	you	see	what	they	are	 do 	 ing 	 	?
what	 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	for	the	origin	of	flapping	flight	?
 may 	 be 	 	it	's	 evolv 	 ed 	 	from	coming	down	from	 tree 	 s 	 	,	and	 try 	 ing 	 	to	control	a	glide	.
stay	tuned	for	that	.
so	then	we	 wonder 	 ed 	 	,	``	can	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	maneuver	with	 th 	 is 	 	?	``
so	there	is	the	 land 	 ing 	 	target	.	could	they	steer	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	it	with	these	 cap 	 abilities 	 	?	here	it	is	in	the	wind	tunnel	.
and	it	 certain 	 ly 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	it	.
you	can	see	it	even	better	from	down	on	top	.
watch	the	animal	.
 definite 	 ly 	 	moving	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	 land 	 ing 	 	target	.
watch	the	whip	of	 it 	 s 	 	tail	 a 	 s 	 	it	 do 	 es 	 	it	.	look	at	that	.
it	's	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	.
so	now	we	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 con 	 fused 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	are	no	 report 	 s 	 	of	it	gliding	.
so	we	went	,	``	oh	my	god	,	we	have	to	go	to	the	field	,	and	see	if	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.	``
 complete 	 ly 	 	 oppos 	 ite 	 	of	the	way	you	'd	see	it	on	a	nature	film	,	of	course	.
we	 wonder 	 ed 	 	,	``	do	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	glide	in	nature	?	``
well	we	went	to	the	 forest 	 s 	 	of	singapore	and	 south 	 east 	 	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	.
and	the	next	video	you	see	is	the	first	time	we	've	 show 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	actual	video	--	not	 stag 	 ed 	 	,	a	real	research	video	--	of	animal	gliding	down	.	there	is	a	red	 tra 	 ject 	 ory 	 	line	.
look	at	the	end	to	see	the	animal	.
but	then	 a 	 s 	 	it	 get 	 s 	 	 close 	 r 	 	to	the	tree	,	look	at	the	close	-	up	.	and	see	if	you	can	see	it	land	.
so	there	it	 come 	 s 	 	down	.	there	is	a	gecko	at	the	end	of	that	 tra 	 ject 	 ory 	 	line	.
you	see	it	there	?	there	?	watch	it	come	down	.
now	watch	up	there	and	you	can	see	the	 land 	 ing 	 	.	did	you	see	it	hit	?
it	 actual 	 ly 	 	uses	 it 	 s 	 	tail	too	,	just	like	we	saw	in	the	lab	.
so	now	we	can	 continu 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 mutual 	 ism 	 	by	 suggest 	 ing 	 	that	they	can	make	an	active	tail	.
and	here	is	the	first	active	tail	,	in	the	robot	,	made	by	boston	 dynamic 	 s 	 	.
so	to	conclude	,	i	think	we	need	to	build	 bio 	 mutual 	 ism 	 s 	 	,	like	i	 show 	 ed 	 	,	that	will	 in 	 crease 	 	the	pace	of	 bas 	 ic 	 	 discover 	 y 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	application	.
to	do	 th 	 is 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	,	we	need	to	 re 	 design 	 	education	in	a	major	way	,	to	balance	depth	with	 inter 	 disciplinary 	 	communication	,	and	 ex 	 plicit 	 ly 	 	train	people	how	to	 con 	 tribute 	 	to	,	and	benefit	from	other	 discipline 	 s 	 	.
and	of	course	you	need	the	 organism 	 s 	 	and	the	environment	to	do	it	.
that	is	,	 whet 	 her 	 	you	care	about	security	,	search	and	 rescu 	 e 	 	or	health	,	we	must	preserve	nature	's	 design 	 s 	 	,	 other 	 wise 	 	these	 secret 	 s 	 	will	be	lost	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
and	from	what	i	heard	from	our	new	 p 	 resident 	 	,	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	 optimist 	 ic 	 	.	thank	you	.
