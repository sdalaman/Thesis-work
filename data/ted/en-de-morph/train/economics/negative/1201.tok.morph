by	the	end	of	 th 	 is 	 	year	,	there	'll	be	 near 	 ly 	 	a	billion	people	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	that	 active 	 ly 	 	use	social	 network 	 ing 	 	 s 	 ites 	 	.
the	one	thing	that	all	of	them	have	in	common	is	that	they	're	going	to	die	.
while	that	might	be	a	 some 	 what 	 	morbid	thought	,	i	think	it	 ha 	 s 	 	some	 re 	 ally 	 	 pro 	 found 	 	 implic 	 ations 	 	that	are	worth	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	.
what	first	got	me	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	blog	post	 author 	 ed 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	by	derek	k.	miller	,	who	was	a	science	and	technology	journalist	who	 di 	 ed 	 	of	cancer	.
and	what	miller	did	was	have	his	family	and	 friend 	 s 	 	write	a	post	that	went	out	 short 	 ly 	 	after	he	 di 	 ed 	 	.
here	's	what	he	wrote	in	 start 	 ing 	 	that	out	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	here	it	is	.	i	'm	dead	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	last	post	to	my	blog	.
in	advance	,	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	that	once	my	body	 final 	 ly 	 	shut	down	from	the	 punish 	 ments 	 	of	my	cancer	,	then	my	family	and	 friend 	 s 	 	publish	 th 	 is 	 	prepared	 mess 	 age 	 	i	wrote	--	the	first	part	of	the	process	of	 turn 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	from	an	active	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	to	an	 archiv 	 e 	 	.	``
now	,	while	 a 	 s 	 	a	journalist	,	miller	's	 archiv 	 e 	 	may	have	 be 	 en 	 	better	written	and	more	 care 	 fully 	 	 cur 	 ated 	 	than	most	,	the	fact	of	the	matter	is	that	all	of	us	 to 	 day 	 	are	creating	an	 archiv 	 e 	 	that	's	 some 	 thing 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	than	 any 	 thing 	 	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	 create 	 d 	 	by	any	previous	generation	.
consider	a	few	 stat 	 s 	 	for	a	moment	.
right	now	there	are	48	 hour 	 s 	 	of	video	 be 	 ing 	 	 upload 	 ed 	 	to	youtube	every	single	minute	.
there	are	200	million	 tweet 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 post 	 ed 	 	every	day	.
and	the	average	facebook	user	is	creating	90	 piece 	 s 	 	of	content	each	month	.
so	when	you	think	about	your	 parent 	 s 	 	or	your	 grand 	 parent 	 s 	 	,	at	best	they	may	have	 create 	 d 	 	some	 photo 	 s 	 	or	home	 video 	 s 	 	,	or	a	 di 	 ary 	 	that	 live 	 s 	 	in	a	box	 some 	 where 	 	.
but	 to 	 day 	 	we	're	all	creating	 th 	 is 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	rich	digital	 archiv 	 e 	 	that	's	going	to	live	in	the	cloud	 in 	 definite 	 ly 	 	,	 year 	 s 	 	after	we	're	gone	.
and	i	think	that	's	going	to	create	some	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 intrigu 	 ing 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	for	 techno 	 logists 	 	.
now	to	be	clear	,	i	'm	a	journalist	and	not	a	 techno 	 logist 	 	,	so	what	i	'd	like	to	do	 brief 	 ly 	 	is	paint	a	picture	of	what	the	present	and	the	future	are	going	to	look	like	.
now	we	're	 al 	 ready 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	some	 service 	 s 	 	that	are	designed	to	let	us	decide	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	our	 on 	 line 	 	profile	and	our	social	media	 account 	 s 	 	after	we	die	.
one	of	them	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 fitting 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	found	me	when	i	 check 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	deli	at	a	restaurant	in	new	york	on	 four 	 square 	 	.
adam	ostrow	:	 hell 	 o 	 	.
death	:	adam	?
ao	:	 yea 	 h 	 	.
death	:	death	can	catch	you	 any 	 where 	 	,	 any 	 time 	 	,	even	at	the	 organ 	 ic 	 	.
ao	:	who	is	 th 	 is 	 	?
death	:	go	to	ifidie	.	net	before	it	's	too	late	.
adam	ostrow	:	kind	of	 creep 	 y 	 	,	right	?
so	what	that	service	 do 	 es 	 	,	 quit 	 e 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	,	is	let	you	create	a	 mess 	 age 	 	or	a	video	that	can	be	 post 	 ed 	 	to	facebook	after	you	die	.
 an 	 other 	 	service	right	now	is	 call 	 ed 	 	1,000	 memor 	 ies 	 	.
and	what	 th 	 is 	 	lets	you	do	is	create	an	 on 	 line 	 	tribute	to	your	 love 	 d 	 	 one 	 s 	 	,	complete	with	 photo 	 s 	 	and	 video 	 s 	 	and	 st 	 ories 	 	that	they	can	post	after	you	die	.
but	what	i	think	 come 	 s 	 	next	is	far	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
now	a	lot	of	you	are	 prob 	 ably 	 	familiar	with	deb	roy	who	,	back	in	march	,	 demonst 	 rated 	 	how	he	was	able	to	 analyz 	 e 	 	more	than	90,000	 hour 	 s 	 	of	home	video	.
i	think	 a 	 s 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	'	ability	to	understand	human	language	and	process	vast	 amount 	 s 	 	of	data	 continu 	 es 	 	to	improve	,	it	's	going	to	 be 	 come 	 	possible	to	 analyz 	 e 	 	an	entire	life	's	worth	of	content	--	the	 tweet 	 s 	 	,	the	 photo 	 s 	 	,	the	 video 	 s 	 	,	the	blog	 post 	 s 	 	--	that	we	're	producing	in	 s 	 uch 	 	massive	 number 	 s 	 	.
and	i	think	 a 	 s 	 	that	 happen 	 s 	 	,	it	's	going	to	 be 	 come 	 	possible	for	our	digital	 person 	 a 	 s 	 	to	 continu 	 e 	 	to	interact	in	the	real	world	long	after	we	're	gone	 thank 	 s 	 	to	the	 vast 	 ness 	 	of	the	amount	of	content	we	're	creating	and	technology	's	ability	to	make	sense	of	it	all	.
now	we	're	 al 	 ready 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	to	see	some	 experiment 	 s 	 	here	.
one	service	 call 	 ed 	 	my	next	tweet	 analyz 	 es 	 	your	entire	twitter	stream	,	 every 	 thing 	 	you	've	 post 	 ed 	 	onto	twitter	,	to	make	some	 predict 	 ions 	 	 a 	 s 	 	to	what	you	might	say	next	.
well	right	now	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	the	 result 	 s 	 	can	be	 some 	 what 	 	 com 	 ical 	 	.
you	can	imagine	what	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	might	look	like	five	,	10	or	20	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	 a 	 s 	 	our	technical	 cap 	 abilities 	 	improve	.
taking	it	a	step	further	,	mit	's	media	lab	is	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 robot 	 s 	 	that	can	interact	more	like	 human 	 s 	 	.
but	what	if	 t 	 hose 	 	 robot 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	interact	based	on	the	 un 	 ique 	 	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	of	a	specific	person	based	on	the	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 piece 	 s 	 	of	content	that	person	 produce 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 life 	 time 	 	?
 final 	 ly 	 	,	think	back	to	 th 	 is 	 	famous	scene	from	election	night	2008	back	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	where	cnn	 beam 	 ed 	 	a	live	 holo 	 gram 	 	of	hip	hop	artist	will	.	i.	am	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	studio	for	an	interview	with	anderson	cooper	.
what	if	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	use	that	same	type	of	technology	to	beam	a	 represent 	 ation 	 	of	our	 love 	 d 	 	 one 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	our	living	rooms	--	 interact 	 ing 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 life 	 like 	 	way	based	on	all	the	content	they	 create 	 d 	 	while	they	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 ive 	 	?
i	think	that	's	going	to	 be 	 come 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	possible	 a 	 s 	 	the	amount	of	data	we	're	producing	and	technology	's	ability	to	understand	it	both	expand	 exponential 	 ly 	 	.
now	in	 clo 	 s 	 ing 	 	,	i	think	what	we	all	need	to	be	 think 	 ing 	 	about	is	if	we	want	that	to	 be 	 come 	 	our	 re 	 ality 	 	--	and	if	so	,	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	for	a	definition	of	life	and	 every 	 thing 	 	that	 come 	 s 	 	after	it	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
