i	'm	going	to	share	with	you	the	story	 a 	 s 	 	to	how	i	have	 be 	 come 	 	an	hiv	/	 aid 	 s 	 	 campaign 	 er 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	name	of	my	campaign	:	 s 	 ing 	 	campaign	.
in	november	of	2003	,	i	was	 invit 	 ed 	 	to	take	part	in	the	launch	of	nelson	mandela	's	46664	 found 	 ation 	 	--	that	is	his	hiv	/	 aid 	 s 	 	 found 	 ation 	 	.
and	46664	is	the	number	that	mandela	had	when	he	was	 imprison 	 ed 	 	in	robben	 is 	 land 	 	.
and	that	's	me	with	youssou	n'dour	,	 on 	 stage 	 	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	time	of	my	life	.
the	next	day	,	all	the	 artist 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 invit 	 ed 	 	to	join	mandela	in	robben	 is 	 land 	 	,	where	he	was	going	to	give	a	 con 	 ference 	 	to	the	world	's	press	,	 stand 	 ing 	 	in	front	of	his	 form 	 er 	 	 pri 	 son 	 	cell	.
you	can	see	the	 bar 	 s 	 	of	the	window	there	.
it	was	 quit 	 e 	 	a	 moment 	 ous 	 	occasion	for	all	of	us	.
in	that	moment	in	time	,	mandela	told	the	world	's	press	that	there	was	a	virtual	genocide	taking	place	in	his	country	;	that	post	-	apartheid	 rain 	 bow 	 	nation	,	a	thousand	people	 we 	 re 	 	 dy 	 ing 	 	on	a	 dai 	 ly 	 	 bas 	 is 	 	and	that	the	front	line	 victim 	 s 	 	,	the	most	 vulner 	 able 	 	of	all	,	 we 	 re 	 	women	and	children	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	huge	impact	on	my	mind	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	am	a	woman	and	i	am	a	mother	,	and	i	had	n't	 real 	 ized 	 	that	the	hiv	/	 aid 	 s 	 	 pan 	 demic 	 	was	 direct 	 ly 	 	 affect 	 ing 	 	women	in	 s 	 uch 	 	a	way	.
and	so	i	 commit 	 ted 	 	--	when	i	left	south	africa	,	when	i	left	capetown	,	i	told	 my 	 self 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	be	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	have	to	talk	about	.
i	have	to	serve	.	``
and	so	,	 sub 	 sequent 	 ly 	 	i	 particip 	 ated 	 	in	every	single	46664	event	that	i	could	take	part	in	and	 g 	 ave 	 	news	 con 	 ference 	 s 	 	,	 interview 	 s 	 	,	 talk 	 ing 	 	and	using	my	platform	 a 	 s 	 	a	 music 	 ian 	 	,	with	my	 commit 	 ment 	 	to	mandela	--	out	of	respect	for	the	tremendous	,	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	work	that	he	had	 d 	 one 	 	.
 every 	 one 	 	in	the	world	 respect 	 s 	 	nelson	mandela	,	 every 	 one 	 	 revere 	 s 	 	nelson	mandela	.
but	do	they	all	know	about	what	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	taking	place	in	south	africa	,	his	country	,	the	country	that	had	one	of	the	highest	 incident 	 s 	 	of	 trans 	 mission 	 	of	the	virus	?
i	think	that	if	i	went	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	street	now	and	i	told	people	what	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	there	,	they	would	be	 shock 	 ed 	 	.
i	was	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	fortunate	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	to	have	met	zackie	achmat	,	the	founder	of	 treat 	 ment 	 	action	campaign	,	an	 in 	 credible 	 	 campaign 	 er 	 	and	activist	.
i	met	him	at	a	46664	event	.
he	was	 wear 	 ing 	 	a	t	-	shirt	like	the	one	i	wear	now	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	tool	--	 th 	 is 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	you	i	am	in	 solid 	 arity 	 	with	people	who	have	hiv	,	people	who	are	living	with	hiv	.
and	in	a	way	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	stigma	,	by	 wear 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	t	-	shirt	i	say	,	``	 y 	 es 	 	,	we	can	talk	about	 th 	 is 	 	issue	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	to	be	in	the	 close 	 t 	 	.	``
i	 be 	 came 	 	a	member	of	 treat 	 ment 	 	action	campaign	and	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	proud	to	be	a	member	of	that	 in 	 credible 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	.
it	's	a	 grass 	 root 	 s 	 	campaign	with	80	percent	 member 	 ship 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	women	,	most	of	whom	are	hiv	-	positive	.
they	work	in	the	field	.
they	have	tremendous	 out 	 reach 	 	to	the	people	who	are	living	 direct 	 ly 	 	with	the	 effect 	 s 	 	of	the	virus	.
they	have	education	 program 	 s 	 	.
they	 br 	 ing 	 	out	the	 issue 	 s 	 	of	stigma	.
it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	what	they	do	.
and	 y 	 es 	 	,	my	 s 	 ing 	 	campaign	 ha 	 s 	 	 support 	 ed 	 	 treat 	 ment 	 	action	campaign	in	the	way	that	i	have	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	raise	 aware 	 ness 	 	and	to	try	to	 al 	 so 	 	raise	 fund 	 s 	 	.
a	lot	of	the	 fund 	 ing 	 	that	i	have	 manage 	 d 	 	to	raise	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	 direct 	 ly 	 	to	 treat 	 ment 	 	action	campaign	and	the	 in 	 credible 	 	work	that	they	do	,	and	are	still	 continu 	 ing 	 	to	do	in	south	africa	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	 s 	 ing 	 	campaign	.
 s 	 ing 	 	campaign	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	just	me	and	about	three	or	four	 wonder 	 ful 	 	people	who	help	to	support	me	.
i	've	 travel 	 ed 	 	all	over	the	world	in	the	last	two	and	a	half	 year 	 s 	 	--	i	went	to	about	12	different	 count 	 ries 	 	.
here	i	am	in	oslo	in	norway	,	 get 	 ting 	 	a	nice	,	fat	check	;	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	in	hong	kong	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	people	to	raise	money	.
in	johannesburg	,	i	had	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	play	to	a	 main 	 ly 	 	white	,	middle	-	class	south	african	audience	who	 end 	 ed 	 	up	in	 tear 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	use	film	 clip 	 s 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	touch	the	heart	,	the	whole	nature	,	of	 th 	 is 	 	 terr 	 ible 	 	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	that	is	taking	place	,	that	people	are	 tend 	 ing 	 	to	avoid	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	 fatigue 	 d 	 	,	and	they	 re 	 ally 	 	do	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	know	what	the	 solution 	 s 	 	are	.
aaron	motsoaledi	,	the	current	health	 mini 	 ster 	 	,	 attend 	 ed 	 	that	concert	and	i	had	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	meet	with	him	,	and	he	 g 	 ave 	 	his	absolute	 commit 	 ment 	 	to	try	to	making	a	change	,	which	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 necess 	 ary 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	in	the	scottish	parliament	.
i	've	 sub 	 sequent 	 ly 	 	 be 	 come 	 	an	 en 	 voy 	 	for	scotland	and	hiv	.
and	i	was	 show 	 ing 	 	them	my	 experience 	 s 	 	and	 try 	 ing 	 	to	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	raise	 aware 	 ness 	 	.
and	once	 aga 	 in 	 	,	in	edinburgh	with	the	 wonder 	 ful 	 	african	children	's	choir	who	i	 simpl 	 y 	 	 ador 	 e 	 	.
and	it	's	children	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	whom	have	 be 	 en 	 	 orphan 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	family	 be 	 ing 	 	 affect 	 ed 	 	by	the	 aid 	 s 	 	virus	.
i	'm	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	here	in	new	york	with	michel	sidibe	--	he	's	the	director	of	unaids	.
and	i	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	 honor 	 ed 	 	by	the	fact	that	michel	 invit 	 ed 	 	me	,	 on 	 ly 	 	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	ago	,	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	unaids	ambassador	.
and	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	,	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 strength 	 en 	 ing 	 	my	platform	and	 broad 	 en 	 ing 	 	my	 out 	 reach 	 	.
the	 mess 	 age 	 	that	unaids	are	 current 	 ly 	 	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	out	to	the	world	is	that	we	would	like	to	see	the	virtual	 elimi 	 nation 	 	of	the	 trans 	 mission 	 	of	the	virus	from	mother	to	child	by	2015	.
it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 ambit 	 ious 	 	goal	but	we	 believ 	 e 	 	it	can	be	 achiev 	 ed 	 	with	 politic 	 al 	 	will	.
 th 	 is 	 	can	happen	.
and	here	i	am	with	a	 pregn 	 ant 	 	woman	,	who	is	hiv	positive	and	we	're	 smil 	 ing 	 	,	both	of	us	are	 smil 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	confident	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	know	that	that	young	woman	is	 receiv 	 ing 	 	 treat 	 ment 	 	so	her	life	can	be	 extend 	 ed 	 	to	take	care	of	the	baby	she	's	about	to	give	birth	to	.
and	her	baby	will	 receiv 	 e 	 	pmtct	,	which	will	mean	that	that	baby	can	be	born	free	of	the	virus	.
now	that	is	 prevent 	 ion 	 	at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	life	.
it	's	one	way	to	start	looking	at	intervention	with	the	 aid 	 s 	 	 pan 	 demic 	 	.
now	,	i	just	would	like	to	finish	off	to	tell	you	the	little	story	about	avelile	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	avelile	--	she	 go 	 es 	 	with	me	 where 	 ver 	 	i	go	.
i	tell	her	story	to	 every 	 one 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	she	 represent 	 s 	 	one	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	hiv	/	 aid 	 s 	 	 orphan 	 s 	 	.
avelile	's	mother	had	hiv	virus	--	she	 di 	 ed 	 	from	 aid 	 s 	 	-	related	 ill 	 ness 	 	.
avelile	had	the	virus	,	she	was	born	with	the	virus	.
and	here	she	is	at	seven	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	 weigh 	 ing 	 	no	more	than	a	one	year	-	old	baby	.
at	 th 	 is 	 	point	in	her	life	,	she	's	 suffer 	 ing 	 	with	full	-	blown	 aid 	 s 	 	and	had	 pneumo 	 nia 	 	.
we	met	her	in	a	hospital	in	the	eastern	cape	and	 s 	 pent 	 	a	whole	afternoon	with	her	--	an	 ador 	 able 	 	child	.
the	 doctor 	 s 	 	and	 nurse 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 phenomen 	 al 	 	.
they	put	her	on	 ver 	 y 	 	special	 nut 	 rit 	 ious 	 	diet	and	took	great	care	of	her	.
and	we	did	n't	know	when	we	left	the	hospital	--	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 film 	 ed 	 	her	story	--	we	did	n't	know	if	she	was	going	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	.
so	,	it	was	 obvious 	 ly 	 	--	it	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 emotion 	 al 	 	 en 	 counter 	 	and	left	us	 feel 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 reson 	 ant 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	direct	experience	,	 th 	 is 	 	one	child	,	you	know	,	that	story	.
five	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	we	went	back	to	south	africa	to	meet	avelile	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	i	'm	 get 	 ting 	 	--	the	 hair 	 s 	 	on	my	--	i	do	n't	know	if	you	can	see	the	 hair 	 s 	 	on	my	 arm 	 s 	 	.
they	're	 stand 	 ing 	 	up	 be 	 cause 	 	i	know	what	i	'm	going	to	show	you	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 transform 	 ation 	 	that	took	place	.
is	n't	it	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	?
that	round	of	 app 	 laus 	 e 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	for	the	 doctor 	 s 	 	and	 nurse 	 s 	 	of	the	hospital	who	took	care	of	avelile	.
and	i	take	it	that	you	appreciate	that	kind	of	 transform 	 ation 	 	.
so	,	i	would	like	to	say	to	you	,	each	one	in	the	audience	,	if	you	feel	that	every	mother	and	every	child	in	the	world	 ha 	 s 	 	the	right	to	have	access	to	good	nutrition	and	good	medical	care	,	and	you	 believ 	 e 	 	that	the	 mill 	 e 	 nnium 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	 goal 	 s 	 	,	 specific 	 ally 	 	five	and	six	,	should	be	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 commit 	 ted 	 	to	by	all	 government 	 s 	 	around	the	world	--	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	in	sub	-	saharan	africa	--	could	you	 pleas 	 e 	 	stand	up	.
i	think	that	's	fair	to	say	,	it	's	 al 	 most 	 	 every 	 one 	 	in	the	hall	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
