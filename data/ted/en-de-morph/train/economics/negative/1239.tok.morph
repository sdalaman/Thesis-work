i	'm	a	garbage	man	.
and	you	might	find	it	 interest 	 ing 	 	that	i	 be 	 came 	 	a	garbage	man	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	 absolute 	 ly 	 	hate	waste	.
i	hope	,	 with 	 in 	 	the	next	10	 minute 	 s 	 	,	to	change	the	way	you	think	about	a	lot	of	the	stuff	in	your	life	.
and	i	'd	like	to	start	at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
think	back	when	you	 we 	 re 	 	just	a	kid	.
how	did	look	at	the	stuff	in	your	life	?
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	it	was	like	these	toddler	 rule 	 s 	 	:	it	's	my	stuff	if	i	saw	it	first	.
the	entire	pile	is	my	stuff	if	i	'm	building	 some 	 thing 	 	.
the	more	stuff	that	's	mine	,	the	better	.
and	of	course	,	it	's	your	stuff	if	it	's	broken	.
well	after	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	about	20	 year 	 s 	 	in	the	 recycl 	 ing 	 	industry	,	it	's	 be 	 come 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	clear	to	me	that	we	do	n't	 necess 	 arily 	 	 leav 	 e 	 	these	toddler	 rule 	 s 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	develop	 in 	 to 	 	 adult 	 s 	 	.
and	let	me	tell	you	why	i	have	that	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	each	and	every	day	at	our	 recycl 	 ing 	 	 plant 	 s 	 	around	the	world	we	handle	about	one	million	 pound 	 s 	 	of	people	's	 dis 	 card 	 ed 	 	stuff	.
now	a	million	 pound 	 s 	 	a	day	 sound 	 s 	 	like	a	lot	of	stuff	,	but	it	's	a	 tin 	 y 	 	drop	of	the	 dur 	 able 	 	 good 	 s 	 	that	are	 dispos 	 ed 	 	each	and	every	year	around	the	world	--	well	less	than	one	percent	.
in	fact	,	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	 estimate 	 s 	 	that	there	's	about	85	billion	 pound 	 s 	 	a	year	of	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	waste	that	 get 	 s 	 	 dis 	 card 	 ed 	 	around	the	world	each	and	every	year	--	and	that	's	one	of	the	most	 rapid 	 ly 	 	growing	 part 	 s 	 	of	our	waste	stream	.
and	if	you	throw	in	other	 dur 	 able 	 	 good 	 s 	 	like	 auto 	 mobile 	 s 	 	and	so	forth	,	that	number	well	more	than	 double 	 s 	 	.
and	of	course	,	the	more	 develop 	 ed 	 	the	country	,	the	 big 	 ger 	 	these	 mountain 	 s 	 	.
now	when	you	see	these	 mountain 	 s 	 	,	most	people	think	of	garbage	.
we	see	above	-	ground	 mine 	 s 	 	.
and	the	reason	we	see	 mine 	 s 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	a	lot	of	 valu 	 able 	 	raw	 material 	 s 	 	that	went	 in 	 to 	 	making	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	in	the	first	place	.
and	it	's	 be 	 coming 	 	 increasing 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	that	we	figure	out	how	to	 ex 	 tract 	 	these	raw	 material 	 s 	 	from	these	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	waste	 stream 	 s 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	've	heard	all	week	at	ted	,	the	world	's	 get 	 ting 	 	to	be	a	 small 	 er 	 	place	with	more	people	in	it	who	want	more	and	more	stuff	.
and	of	course	,	they	want	the	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	and	the	 tool 	 s 	 	that	 man 	 y 	 	of	us	take	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	.
and	what	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	making	 t 	 hose 	 	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	and	 tool 	 s 	 	that	we	use	every	single	day	?
it	's	 most 	 ly 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 type 	 s 	 	of	 plastic 	 s 	 	and	 man 	 y 	 	 type 	 s 	 	of	 metal 	 s 	 	.
and	the	 metal 	 s 	 	,	we	 typical 	 ly 	 	get	from	ore	that	we	mine	in	ever	 widen 	 ing 	 	 mine 	 s 	 	and	ever	 deepen 	 ing 	 	 mine 	 s 	 	around	the	world	.
and	the	 plastic 	 s 	 	,	we	get	from	oil	,	which	we	go	to	more	remote	 location 	 s 	 	and	drill	ever	 deep 	 er 	 	 well 	 s 	 	to	 ex 	 tract 	 	.
and	these	 practice 	 s 	 	have	significant	economic	and	 environment 	 al 	 	 implic 	 ations 	 	that	we	're	 al 	 ready 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	to	see	 to 	 day 	 	.
the	good	news	is	we	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	 re 	 cover 	 	 material 	 s 	 	from	our	end	-	of	-	life	stuff	and	 start 	 ing 	 	to	 re 	 cycle 	 	our	end	-	of	-	life	stuff	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	in	 region 	 s 	 	of	the	world	like	here	in	europe	that	have	 recycl 	 ing 	 	 poli 	 cies 	 	in	place	that	 requir 	 e 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	be	 recycl 	 ed 	 	in	a	 respons 	 ible 	 	manner	.
most	of	what	's	 extra 	 cted 	 	from	our	end	-	of	-	life	stuff	,	if	it	 make 	 s 	 	it	to	a	 recycl 	 er 	 	,	are	the	 metal 	 s 	 	.
to	put	that	in	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	--	and	i	'm	using	steel	 a 	 s 	 	a	 pr 	 oxy 	 	here	for	 metal 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	the	most	common	metal	--	if	your	stuff	 make 	 s 	 	it	to	a	 recycl 	 er 	 	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	over	90	percent	of	the	 metal 	 s 	 	are	going	to	be	 re 	 cover 	 ed 	 	and	 re 	 used 	 	for	 an 	 other 	 	purpose	.
 plastic 	 s 	 	are	a	whole	other	story	:	well	less	than	10	percent	are	 re 	 cover 	 ed 	 	.
in	fact	,	it	's	more	like	five	percent	.
most	of	it	's	 inciner 	 ated 	 	or	 land 	 fill 	 ed 	 	.
now	most	people	think	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	 plastic 	 s 	 	are	a	throw	-	away	material	,	have	 ver 	 y 	 	little	value	.
but	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 plastic 	 s 	 	are	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 time 	 s 	 	more	 valu 	 able 	 	than	steel	.
and	there	's	more	 plastic 	 s 	 	 produce 	 d 	 	and	 consum 	 ed 	 	around	the	world	on	a	volume	 bas 	 is 	 	every	year	than	steel	.
so	why	is	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 ple 	 nt 	 iful 	 	and	 valu 	 able 	 	material	not	 re 	 cover 	 ed 	 	at	 any 	 where 	 	near	the	rate	of	the	less	 valu 	 able 	 	material	?
well	it	's	 pre 	 domin 	 ant 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 metal 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	to	 re 	 cycle 	 	from	other	 material 	 s 	 	and	from	one	 an 	 other 	 	.
they	have	 ver 	 y 	 	different	 den 	 s 	 ities 	 	.
they	have	different	 electric 	 al 	 	and	 magnet 	 ic 	 	 proper 	 ties 	 	.
and	they	even	have	different	 color 	 s 	 	.
so	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	for	either	 human 	 s 	 	or	 machine 	 s 	 	to	 separat 	 e 	 	these	 metal 	 s 	 	from	one	 an 	 other 	 	and	from	other	 material 	 s 	 	.
 plastic 	 s 	 	have	 over 	 lap 	 ping 	 	 den 	 s 	 ities 	 	over	a	 ver 	 y 	 	narrow	range	.
they	have	either	 ident 	 ical 	 	or	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	 electric 	 al 	 	and	 magnet 	 ic 	 	 proper 	 ties 	 	.
and	any	plastic	can	be	any	color	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	well	know	.
so	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	ways	of	 separat 	 ing 	 	 material 	 s 	 	just	 simpl 	 y 	 	do	n't	work	for	 plastic 	 s 	 	.
 an 	 other 	 	 con 	 sequence 	 	of	 metal 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	so	easy	to	 re 	 cycle 	 	by	 human 	 s 	 	is	that	a	lot	of	our	stuff	from	the	 develop 	 ed 	 	world	--	and	 s 	 ad 	 ly 	 	to	say	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	from	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	,	where	we	do	n't	have	any	 recycl 	 ing 	 	 poli 	 cies 	 	in	place	like	here	in	europe	--	 find 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	way	to	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	for	low	-	cost	 recycl 	 ing 	 	.
people	,	for	 a 	 s 	 	little	 a 	 s 	 	a	dollar	a	day	,	pick	through	our	stuff	.
they	 ex 	 tract 	 	what	they	can	,	which	is	 most 	 ly 	 	the	 metal 	 s 	 	--	circuit	 board 	 s 	 	and	so	forth	--	and	they	 leav 	 e 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	 most 	 ly 	 	what	they	ca	n't	 re 	 cover 	 	,	which	is	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 most 	 ly 	 	the	 plastic 	 s 	 	.
or	they	burn	the	 plastic 	 s 	 	to	get	to	the	 metal 	 s 	 	in	burn	 house 	 s 	 	like	you	see	here	.
and	they	 ex 	 tract 	 	the	 metal 	 s 	 	by	hand	.
now	while	 th 	 is 	 	may	be	the	low	-	economic	-	cost	solution	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 certain 	 ly 	 	not	the	low	-	 environment 	 al 	 	or	human	health	-	and	-	 safe 	 ty 	 	solution	.
i	call	 th 	 is 	 	 environment 	 al 	 	 arbitr 	 age 	 	.
and	it	's	not	fair	,	it	's	not	safe	and	it	's	not	 sustain 	 able 	 	.
now	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 plastic 	 s 	 	are	so	 ple 	 nt 	 iful 	 	--	and	by	the	way	,	 t 	 hose 	 	other	 method 	 s 	 	do	n't	lead	to	the	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	of	 plastic 	 s 	 	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	--	but	people	do	try	to	 re 	 cover 	 	the	 plastic 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	just	one	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	photo	i	took	 stand 	 ing 	 	on	the	 roof 	 top 	 s 	 	of	one	of	the	largest	 s 	 lum 	 s 	 	in	the	world	in	mumbai	,	india	.
they	store	the	 plastic 	 s 	 	on	the	 roof 	 s 	 	.
they	 br 	 ing 	 	them	 be 	 low 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 roof 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	small	 work 	 shop 	 s 	 	like	these	,	and	people	try	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	 separat 	 e 	 	the	 plastic 	 s 	 	,	by	color	,	by	shape	,	by	feel	,	by	any	 techni 	 que 	 	they	can	.
and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	they	'll	resort	to	what	's	known	 a 	 s 	 	the	``	burn	and	sniff	``	 techni 	 que 	 	where	they	'll	burn	the	plastic	and	smell	the	 fum 	 es 	 	to	try	to	determine	the	type	of	plastic	.
 non 	 e 	 	of	these	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	result	in	any	amount	of	 recycl 	 ing 	 	in	any	significant	way	.
and	by	the	way	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	do	n't	try	 th 	 is 	 	 techni 	 que 	 	at	home	.
so	what	are	we	to	do	about	 th 	 is 	 	space	-	age	material	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	what	we	used	to	call	a	space	-	aged	material	,	these	 plastic 	 s 	 	?
well	i	 certain 	 ly 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	it	's	far	too	 valu 	 able 	 	and	far	too	abundant	to	keep	 put 	 ting 	 	back	in	the	ground	or	 certain 	 ly 	 	 s 	 end 	 	up	in	smoke	.
so	about	20	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	 liter 	 ally 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	in	my	 gar 	 age 	 	 tinker 	 ing 	 	around	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	how	to	 separat 	 e 	 	these	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	 material 	 s 	 	from	each	other	,	and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 enlist 	 ed 	 	a	lot	of	my	 friend 	 s 	 	,	in	the	 min 	 ing 	 	world	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	and	in	the	 plastic 	 s 	 	world	,	and	we	 start 	 ed 	 	going	around	to	 min 	 ing 	 	 labor 	 ator 	 ies 	 	around	the	world	.
 be 	 cause 	 	after	all	,	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	above	-	ground	 min 	 ing 	 	.
and	we	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	broke	the	code	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	last	 front 	 ier 	 	of	 recycl 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	the	last	major	material	to	be	 re 	 cover 	 ed 	 	in	any	significant	amount	on	the	earth	.
and	we	 final 	 ly 	 	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	how	to	do	it	.
and	in	the	process	,	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 re 	 creating 	 	how	the	 plastic 	 s 	 	industry	 make 	 s 	 	 plastic 	 s 	 	.
the	 tradition 	 al 	 	way	to	make	 plastic 	 s 	 	is	with	oil	or	 petro 	 chemical 	 s 	 	.
you	 break 	 down 	 	the	 molecule 	 s 	 	,	you	 re 	 combine 	 	them	in	 ver 	 y 	 	specific	ways	,	to	make	all	the	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 plastic 	 s 	 	that	we	enjoy	each	and	every	day	.
we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	there	's	got	to	be	a	more	 sustain 	 able 	 	way	to	make	 plastic 	 s 	 	.
and	not	just	 sustain 	 able 	 	from	an	 environment 	 al 	 	 stand 	 point 	 	,	 sustain 	 able 	 	from	an	economic	 stand 	 point 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
well	a	good	place	to	start	is	with	waste	.
it	 certain 	 ly 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	cost	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	oil	,	and	it	's	 ple 	 nt 	 iful 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	hope	that	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	see	from	the	 photograph 	 s 	 	.
and	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	not	 break 	 ing 	 	down	the	plastic	 in 	 to 	 	 molecule 	 s 	 	and	 recombi 	 ning 	 	them	,	we	're	using	a	 min 	 ing 	 	approach	to	 ex 	 tract 	 	the	 material 	 s 	 	.
we	have	 significant 	 ly 	 	lower	capital	 cost 	 s 	 	in	our	plant	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	.
we	have	enormous	energy	 saving 	 s 	 	.
i	do	n't	know	how	 man 	 y 	 	other	 project 	 s 	 	on	the	planet	right	now	can	 s 	 ave 	 	80	to	90	percent	of	the	energy	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	making	 some 	 thing 	 	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	way	.
and	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 p 	 lop 	 ping 	 	down	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	hundred	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	build	a	chemical	plant	that	will	 on 	 ly 	 	make	one	type	of	plastic	for	 it 	 s 	 	entire	life	,	our	 plant 	 s 	 	can	make	any	type	of	plastic	we	feed	them	.
and	we	make	a	drop	-	in	 re 	 placement 	 	for	that	plastic	that	's	made	from	 petro 	 chemical 	 s 	 	.
our	 custom 	 ers 	 	get	to	enjoy	huge	co	2	 saving 	 s 	 	.
they	get	to	close	the	loop	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 product 	 s 	 	.
and	they	get	to	make	more	 sustain 	 able 	 	 product 	 s 	 	.
in	the	short	time	period	i	have	,	i	want	to	show	you	a	little	bit	of	a	sense	about	how	we	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	 start 	 s 	 	with	metal	 recycl 	 ers 	 	who	shred	our	stuff	 in 	 to 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	small	bits	.
they	 re 	 cover 	 	the	 metal 	 s 	 	and	 leav 	 e 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	 shred 	 der 	 	residue	--	it	's	 the 	 ir 	 	waste	--	a	 ver 	 y 	 	complex	 mix 	 ture 	 	of	 material 	 s 	 	,	but	 pre 	 domin 	 ant 	 ly 	 	 plastic 	 s 	 	.
we	take	out	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	n't	 plastic 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 metal 	 s 	 	they	 mis 	 s 	 ed 	 	,	 carpet 	 ing 	 	,	foam	,	rubber	,	wood	,	glass	,	paper	,	you	name	it	.
even	an	 occasion 	 al 	 	dead	animal	,	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	.
and	it	 go 	 es 	 	in	the	first	part	of	our	process	here	,	which	is	more	like	 tradition 	 al 	 	 recycl 	 ing 	 	.
we	're	 s 	 iev 	 ing 	 	the	material	,	we	're	using	 magnet 	 s 	 	,	we	're	using	air	 class 	 ification 	 	.
it	 look 	 s 	 	like	the	 will 	 y 	 	wonka	 factor 	 y 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	.
at	the	end	of	 th 	 is 	 	process	,	we	have	a	 mix 	 ed 	 	plastic	composite	:	 man 	 y 	 	different	 type 	 s 	 	of	 plastic 	 s 	 	and	 man 	 y 	 	different	 grade 	 s 	 	of	 plastic 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	more	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	part	of	our	process	,	and	the	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	work	,	multi	-	step	 separat 	 ion 	 	process	 begin 	 s 	 	.
we	grind	the	plastic	down	to	about	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	your	small	 finger 	 nail 	 	.
we	use	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 high 	 ly 	 	 autom 	 ated 	 	process	to	sort	 t 	 hose 	 	 plastic 	 s 	 	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	by	type	,	but	by	grade	.
and	out	the	end	of	that	part	of	the	process	come	little	 flake 	 s 	 	of	plastic	:	one	type	,	one	grade	.
we	then	use	optical	 sort 	 ing 	 	to	color	sort	 th 	 is 	 	material	.
we	blend	it	in	50,000	-	lb	.	 blend 	 ing 	 	 s 	 ilo 	 s 	 	.
we	push	that	material	to	 extr 	 ud 	 ers 	 	where	we	melt	it	,	push	it	through	small	die	 hole 	 s 	 	,	make	spaghetti	-	like	plastic	 strand 	 s 	 	.
and	we	chop	 t 	 hose 	 	 strand 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	what	are	 call 	 ed 	 	 pel 	 lets 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	the	 curr 	 ency 	 	of	the	 plastic 	 s 	 	industry	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	same	material	that	you	would	get	from	oil	.
and	 to 	 day 	 	,	we	're	producing	it	from	your	old	stuff	,	and	it	's	going	right	back	 in 	 to 	 	your	new	stuff	.
so	now	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	your	stuff	 end 	 ing 	 	up	on	a	 hill 	 side 	 	in	a	 develop 	 ing 	 	country	or	 liter 	 ally 	 	going	up	in	smoke	,	you	can	find	your	old	stuff	back	on	top	of	your	desk	in	new	 product 	 s 	 	,	in	your	 off 	 ice 	 	,	or	back	at	work	in	your	home	.
and	these	are	just	a	few	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	that	are	 buy 	 ing 	 	our	plastic	,	 re 	 placing 	 	virgin	plastic	,	to	make	 the 	 ir 	 	new	 product 	 s 	 	.
so	i	hope	i	've	 change 	 d 	 	the	way	you	look	at	at	 l 	 east 	 	some	of	the	stuff	in	your	life	.
we	took	our	 clue 	 s 	 	from	mother	nature	.
mother	nature	 waste 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	little	,	 re 	 uses 	 	 practical 	 ly 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	.
and	i	hope	that	you	stop	looking	at	 your 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	consumer	--	that	's	a	label	i	've	 al 	 ways 	 	 hat 	 ed 	 	my	entire	life	--	and	think	of	 your 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	just	using	 resource 	 s 	 	in	one	form	,	 un 	 til 	 	they	can	be	 transform 	 ed 	 	to	 an 	 other 	 	form	for	 an 	 other 	 	use	 lat 	 er 	 	in	time	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	i	hope	you	agree	with	me	to	change	that	last	toddler	rule	just	a	little	bit	to	:	``	if	it	's	broken	,	it	's	my	stuff	.	``
thank	you	for	your	time	.
