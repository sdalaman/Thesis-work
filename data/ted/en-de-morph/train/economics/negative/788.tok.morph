last	year	here	at	ted	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	you	to	give	me	your	data	,	to	put	your	data	on	the	web	,	on	the	 bas 	 is 	 	that	if	people	put	data	onto	the	web	--	government	data	,	scientific	data	,	community	data	,	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	--	it	will	be	used	by	other	people	to	do	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	in	ways	that	they	never	could	have	 imagin 	 ed 	 	.
so	,	 to 	 day 	 	i	'm	back	just	to	show	you	a	few	 thing 	 s 	 	,	to	show	you	,	in	fact	,	there	is	an	open	data	 move 	 ment 	 	 a 	 foot 	 	,	now	,	around	the	world	.
the	cry	of	``	raw	data	now	!	``
which	i	made	people	make	in	the	 audit 	 orium 	 	,	was	heard	around	the	world	.
so	,	let	's	roll	the	video	.
a	classic	story	,	the	first	one	which	 lot 	 s 	 	of	people	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	,	was	when	in	march	--	on	march	10th	in	fact	,	soon	after	ted	--	paul	clarke	,	in	the	u.k.	government	,	 blog 	 ged 	 	,	``	oh	,	i	've	just	got	some	raw	data	.	here	it	is	,	it	's	about	 bi 	 cycle 	 	 accident 	 s 	 	.	``
two	 day 	 s 	 	it	took	the	 time 	 s 	 	 on 	 line 	 	to	make	a	map	,	a	 mash 	 able 	 	map	--	we	call	these	 thing 	 s 	 	mash	-	 up 	 s 	 	--	a	 mash 	 ed 	 	-	up	user	 inter 	 face 	 	that	 allow 	 s 	 	you	to	go	in	there	and	have	a	look	and	find	out	 whet 	 her 	 	your	 bi 	 cycle 	 	route	to	work	was	 affect 	 ed 	 	.
here	's	more	data	,	traffic	survey	data	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	put	out	by	the	u.k.	government	,	and	 be 	 cause 	 	they	put	it	up	using	the	linked	data	 standard 	 s 	 	,	then	a	user	could	just	make	a	map	,	just	by	 click 	 ing 	 	.
 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	data	affect	 thing 	 s 	 	?	well	,	let	's	get	back	to	2008	.
look	at	zanesville	,	ohio	.
here	's	a	map	a	lawyer	made	.	he	put	on	it	the	water	plant	,	and	which	 house 	 s 	 	are	there	,	which	 house 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	the	water	.
and	he	got	,	from	other	data	 source 	 s 	 	,	information	to	show	which	 house 	 s 	 	are	occupied	by	white	people	.
well	,	there	was	too	much	of	a	correlation	,	he	felt	,	between	which	 house 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	occupied	by	white	people	and	which	 house 	 s 	 	had	water	,	and	the	 judg 	 e 	 	was	not	 impress 	 ed 	 	either	.
the	 judg 	 e 	 	was	not	 impress 	 ed 	 	to	the	tune	of	10.9	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
that	's	the	power	of	taking	one	piece	of	data	,	 an 	 other 	 	piece	of	data	,	 put 	 ting 	 	it	together	,	and	 show 	 ing 	 	the	result	.
let	's	look	at	some	data	from	the	u.k.	now	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	u.k.	government	data	,	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	 in 	 dependent 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	where	 do 	 es 	 	my	money	go	.
it	 allow 	 s 	 	 any 	 body 	 	to	go	there	and	burrow	down	.
you	can	burrow	down	by	a	 part 	 icular 	 	type	of	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	,	or	you	can	go	through	all	the	different	 region 	 s 	 	and	 compar 	 e 	 	them	.
so	,	that	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	the	u.k.	with	u.k.	government	data	.
 y 	 es 	 	,	 certain 	 ly 	 	you	can	do	it	over	here	.
here	's	a	 s 	 ite 	 	which	 allow 	 s 	 	you	to	look	at	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	in	california	.
take	an	 arbitr 	 ary 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	long	beach	,	california	,	you	can	go	and	have	a	look	at	what	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	money	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	on	different	 thing 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	energy	.
in	fact	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	graph	of	the	number	of	data	 set 	 s 	 	in	the	 re 	 posit 	 ories 	 	of	 data 	 .gov 	 	,	and	 data 	 .gov 	 .uk 	 	.
and	i	'm	 de 	 light 	 ed 	 	to	see	a	great	 com 	 petition 	 	between	the	u.k.	in	blue	,	and	the	u.s.	in	red	.
how	can	you	use	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	?
well	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	if	you	have	 lot 	 s 	 	of	data	about	 place 	 s 	 	you	can	take	,	from	a	 post 	 code 	 	--	which	is	like	a	zip	plus	four	--	for	a	specific	group	of	 house 	 s 	 	,	you	can	make	paper	,	print	off	a	paper	which	 ha 	 s 	 	got	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	specific	 thing 	 s 	 	about	the	bus	 stop 	 s 	 	,	the	 thing 	 s 	 	 specific 	 ally 	 	near	you	.
on	a	 large 	 r 	 	scale	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	mash	-	up	of	the	data	which	was	released	about	the	afghan	 election 	 s 	 	.
it	 allow 	 s 	 	you	to	set	your	own	 cri 	 ter 	 ia 	 	for	what	sort	of	 thing 	 s 	 	you	want	to	look	at	.
the	red	 circle 	 s 	 	are	 poll 	 ing 	 	 station 	 s 	 	,	 select 	 ed 	 	by	your	 cri 	 ter 	 ia 	 	.
and	then	you	can	select	 al 	 so 	 	other	 thing 	 s 	 	on	the	map	to	see	what	other	 factor 	 s 	 	,	like	the	threat	level	.
so	,	that	was	government	data	.
i	 al 	 so 	 	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	community	-	generated	data	--	in	fact	i	 edit 	 ed 	 	some	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	wiki	map	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	open	street	map	.
``	 ter 	 race 	 	theater	``	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	put	on	the	map	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	n't	on	the	map	before	ted	last	year	.
i	was	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	person	 edit 	 ing 	 	the	open	street	map	.
each	flash	on	 th 	 is 	 	 visual 	 ization 	 	--	put	together	by	ito	world	--	 show 	 s 	 	an	edit	in	2009	made	to	the	open	street	map	.
let	's	now	spin	the	world	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	same	year	.
every	flash	is	an	edit	.	 some 	 body 	 	 some 	 where 	 	looking	at	the	open	street	map	,	and	 real 	 izing 	 	it	could	be	better	.
you	can	see	europe	is	 a 	 blaze 	 	with	 update 	 s 	 	.
some	 place 	 s 	 	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	not	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	they	should	be	.
here	 focus 	 ing 	 	in	on	 ha 	 iti 	 	.
the	map	of	port	au	-	prince	at	the	end	of	2009	was	not	all	it	could	be	,	not	 a 	 s 	 	good	 a 	 s 	 	the	map	of	california	.
 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	just	after	the	 earth 	 quake 	 	,	geoeye	,	a	commercial	company	,	released	satellite	 image 	 ry 	 	with	a	 licens 	 e 	 	,	which	 allow 	 ed 	 	the	open	-	source	community	to	use	it	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	january	,	in	time	lapse	,	of	people	 edit 	 ing 	 	...	that	's	the	 earth 	 quake 	 	.
after	the	 earth 	 quake 	 	,	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	,	people	all	over	the	world	,	 mapper 	 s 	 	who	 want 	 ed 	 	to	help	,	and	could	,	 look 	 ed 	 	at	that	 image 	 ry 	 	,	built	the	map	,	 quick 	 ly 	 	building	it	up	.
we	're	 focus 	 ing 	 	now	on	port	-	au	-	prince	.
the	light	blue	is	 refuge 	 e 	 	 camp 	 s 	 	these	 volunteer 	 s 	 	had	 spot 	 ted 	 	from	the	[	satellite	 image 	 s 	 	]	.
so	,	now	we	have	,	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	,	a	real	-	time	map	 show 	 ing 	 	where	there	are	 refuge 	 e 	 	 camp 	 s 	 	--	 rapid 	 ly 	 	 be 	 came 	 	the	best	map	to	use	if	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	relief	work	in	port	-	au	-	prince	.
witness	the	fact	that	it	's	here	on	 th 	 is 	 	garmin	 de 	 vice 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	used	by	 rescu 	 e 	 	team	in	 ha 	 iti 	 	.
there	's	the	map	 show 	 ing 	 	,	on	the	left	-	hand	side	,	that	hospital	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	that	's	a	hospital	ship	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	real	-	time	map	that	 show 	 s 	 	 block 	 ed 	 	 road 	 s 	 	,	 damage 	 d 	 	 building 	 s 	 	,	 refuge 	 e 	 	 camp 	 s 	 	--	it	 show 	 s 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 need 	 ed 	 	[	for	 rescu 	 e 	 	and	relief	work	]	.
so	,	if	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	that	at	all	,	i	just	 want 	 ed 	 	to	say	:	 what 	 ever 	 	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	you	've	just	 be 	 en 	 	 chant 	 ing 	 	,	``	raw	data	now	!	``
or	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	 put 	 ting 	 	government	or	scientific	data	 on 	 line 	 	,	i	just	 want 	 ed 	 	to	take	 th 	 is 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	say	:	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	,	and	we	have	 on 	 ly 	 	just	 start 	 ed 	 	!
