 s 	 hall 	 	i	ask	for	a	show	of	 hand 	 s 	 	or	a	 clap 	 ping 	 	of	people	in	different	 generation 	 s 	 	?
i	'm	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	how	 man 	 y 	 	are	three	to	12	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
 non 	 e 	 	,	huh	?
all	right	.
i	'm	going	to	talk	about	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	.
do	you	remember	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	when	you	 we 	 re 	 	that	age	?
 dinosaur 	 s 	 	are	kind	of	funny	,	you	know	.
we	're	going	to	kind	of	go	in	a	different	direction	right	now	.
i	hope	you	all	 real 	 ize 	 	that	.
so	i	'll	just	give	you	my	 mess 	 age 	 	up	front	:	try	not	to	go	extinct	.
that	's	it	.
people	ask	me	a	lot	--	in	fact	,	one	of	the	most	 ask 	 ed 	 	 question 	 s 	 	i	get	is	,	why	do	children	like	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	so	much	?
what	's	the	 fasci 	 nation 	 	?
and	i	 usual 	 ly 	 	just	say	,	``	well	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	big	,	different	and	gone	.	``
they	're	all	gone	.
well	that	's	not	true	,	but	we	'll	get	to	the	goose	in	a	minute	.
so	that	's	sort	of	the	theme	:	big	,	different	and	gone	.
the	title	of	my	talk	:	shape	-	shifting	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	:	the	cause	of	a	 pre 	 mature 	 	 extinct 	 ion 	 	.
now	i	 assum 	 e 	 	that	we	remember	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	.
and	there	's	 lot 	 s 	 	of	different	 shape 	 s 	 	.
 lot 	 s 	 	of	different	 kind 	 s 	 	.
a	long	time	ago	,	back	in	the	early	1900s	,	 museum 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	out	looking	for	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	.
they	went	out	and	 gather 	 ed 	 	them	up	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	story	.
every	museum	 want 	 ed 	 	a	little	 big 	 ger 	 	or	better	one	than	 any 	 body 	 	else	had	.
so	if	the	museum	in	toronto	went	out	and	 collect 	 ed 	 	a	tyrannosaur	,	a	big	one	,	then	the	museum	in	ottawa	 want 	 ed 	 	a	 big 	 ger 	 	one	and	a	better	one	.
and	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	for	all	 museum 	 s 	 	.
so	 every 	 one 	 	was	out	looking	for	all	these	 big 	 ger 	 	and	better	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	in	the	early	1900s	.
by	about	1970	,	some	 scientist 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	around	and	they	thought	,	``	what	in	the	world	?
look	at	these	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	.
they	're	all	big	.
where	are	all	the	little	 one 	 s 	 	?	``
and	they	thought	about	it	and	they	even	wrote	 paper 	 s 	 	about	it	:	``	where	are	the	little	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	?	``
well	,	go	to	a	museum	,	you	'll	see	,	see	how	 man 	 y 	 	baby	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	there	are	.
people	 assum 	 ed 	 	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	problem	--	people	 assum 	 ed 	 	that	if	they	had	little	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	,	if	they	had	juvenile	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	,	they	'd	be	easy	to	identify	.
you	'd	have	a	big	dinosaur	and	a	 little 	 r 	 	dinosaur	.
but	all	they	had	 we 	 re 	 	big	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	.
and	it	 come 	 s 	 	down	to	a	couple	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
first	off	,	 scientist 	 s 	 	have	 ego 	 s 	 	,	and	 scientist 	 s 	 	like	to	name	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	.
they	like	to	name	 any 	 thing 	 	.
 every 	 body 	 	 like 	 s 	 	to	have	 the 	 ir 	 	own	animal	that	they	named	.
and	so	every	time	they	found	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 look 	 ed 	 	a	little	different	,	they	named	it	 some 	 thing 	 	different	.
and	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	of	course	,	is	we	 end 	 ed 	 	up	with	a	whole	bunch	of	different	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	.
in	1975	,	a	light	went	on	in	 some 	 body 	 	's	head	.
dr.	peter	dodson	at	the	university	of	pennsylvania	 actual 	 ly 	 	 real 	 ized 	 	that	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	grew	kind	of	like	 bird 	 s 	 	do	,	which	is	different	than	the	way	 reptil 	 es 	 	grow	.
and	in	fact	,	he	used	the	 cass 	 ow 	 ary 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
and	it	's	kind	of	cool	--	if	you	look	at	the	 cass 	 ow 	 ary 	 	,	or	any	of	the	 bird 	 s 	 	that	have	 crest 	 s 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 head 	 s 	 	,	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	grow	to	about	80	percent	adult	 s 	 ize 	 	before	the	crest	 start 	 s 	 	to	grow	.
now	think	about	that	.
they	're	 bas 	 ically 	 	 retain 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	juvenile	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	late	in	what	we	call	 onto 	 geny 	 	.
so	 allo 	 metric 	 	cranial	 onto 	 geny 	 	is	 relat 	 ive 	 	skull	growth	.
so	you	can	see	that	if	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	found	one	that	was	80	percent	grown	and	you	did	n't	know	that	it	was	going	to	grow	up	to	a	 cass 	 ow 	 ary 	 	,	you	would	think	they	 we 	 re 	 	two	different	 animal 	 s 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	problem	,	and	peter	dodson	 point 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	out	using	some	duck	-	 bill 	 ed 	 	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	then	 call 	 ed 	 	hypacrosaurus	.
and	he	 show 	 ed 	 	that	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	to	take	a	baby	and	an	adult	and	make	an	average	of	what	it	should	look	like	,	if	it	grew	in	sort	of	a	linear	fashion	,	it	would	have	a	crest	about	half	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	adult	.
but	the	actual	sub	-	adult	at	65	percent	had	no	crest	at	all	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	was	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	people	went	 ast 	 ray 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
i	mean	,	if	they	'd	have	just	taken	that	,	taken	peter	dodson	's	work	,	and	gone	on	with	that	,	then	we	would	have	a	lot	less	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	than	we	have	.
but	 scientist 	 s 	 	have	 ego 	 s 	 	;	they	like	to	name	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	so	they	went	on	 na 	 ming 	 	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	different	.
now	we	have	a	way	of	 actual 	 ly 	 	 test 	 ing 	 	to	see	 whet 	 her 	 	a	dinosaur	,	or	any	animal	,	is	a	young	one	or	an	 old 	 er 	 	one	.
and	that	's	by	 actual 	 ly 	 	cutting	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 bone 	 s 	 	.
but	cutting	 in 	 to 	 	the	 bone 	 s 	 	of	a	dinosaur	is	hard	to	do	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	imagine	,	 be 	 cause 	 	in	 museum 	 s 	 	 bone 	 s 	 	are	precious	.
you	go	 in 	 to 	 	a	museum	and	they	take	 re 	 ally 	 	good	care	of	them	.
they	put	them	in	foam	,	little	 contain 	 ers 	 	.
they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	well	taken	care	of	.
they	do	n't	like	it	if	you	come	in	and	want	to	saw	them	open	and	look	 in 	 side 	 	.
so	they	do	n't	 normal 	 ly 	 	let	you	do	that	.
but	i	have	a	museum	and	i	collect	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	and	i	can	saw	mine	open	.
so	that	's	what	i	do	.
so	if	you	cut	open	a	little	dinosaur	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	spongy	 in 	 side 	 	like	a	.
and	if	you	cut	 in 	 to 	 	an	 old 	 er 	 	dinosaur	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	massive	.
you	can	tell	it	's	mature	bone	.
so	it	's	real	easy	to	tell	them	 a 	 part 	 	.
so	what	i	want	to	do	is	show	you	these	.
in	north	america	in	the	 north 	 ern 	 	 plain 	 s 	 	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	and	the	southern	 plain 	 s 	 	of	alberta	and	saskatchewan	,	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	unit	of	rock	 call 	 ed 	 	the	hell	creek	 form 	 ation 	 	that	 produce 	 s 	 	the	last	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	that	lived	on	earth	.
and	there	are	12	of	them	that	 every 	 one 	 	 recogn 	 ize 	 s 	 	--	i	mean	the	12	 prim 	 ary 	 	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	that	went	extinct	.
and	so	we	will	evaluate	them	.
and	that	's	sort	of	what	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	.
so	my	 student 	 s 	 	,	my	staff	,	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	cutting	them	open	.
now	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	imagine	,	cutting	open	a	leg	bone	is	one	thing	,	but	when	you	go	to	a	museum	and	say	,	``	you	do	n't	mind	if	i	cut	open	your	dinosaur	's	skull	do	you	?	``
they	say	,	``	go	away	.	``
so	here	are	12	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	.
and	we	want	to	look	at	these	three	first	.
so	these	are	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	that	are	 call 	 ed 	 	pachycephalosaurs	.
and	 every 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	that	these	three	 animal 	 s 	 	are	related	.
and	the	assumption	is	is	that	they	're	related	like	 cousin 	 s 	 	or	 what 	 ever 	 	.
but	no	one	ever	 consider 	 ed 	 	that	they	might	be	more	 close 	 ly 	 	related	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	people	 look 	 ed 	 	at	them	and	they	saw	the	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	.
and	you	all	know	that	if	you	are	going	to	determine	 whet 	 her 	 	you	're	related	to	your	brother	or	your	sister	,	you	ca	n't	do	it	by	looking	at	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	.
you	can	 on 	 ly 	 	determine	 related 	 ness 	 	by	looking	for	 similar 	 ities 	 	.
so	people	 we 	 re 	 	looking	at	these	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	how	different	they	are	.
pachycephalosaurus	 ha 	 s 	 	a	big	,	thick	 dom 	 e 	 	on	 it 	 s 	 	head	,	and	it	's	got	some	little	 bump 	 s 	 	on	the	back	of	 it 	 s 	 	head	,	and	it	's	got	a	bunch	of	 gna 	 r 	 ly 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	on	the	end	of	 it 	 s 	 	nose	.
and	then	stygimoloch	,	 an 	 other 	 	dinosaur	from	the	same	age	,	lived	at	the	same	time	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 spike 	 s 	 	 stick 	 ing 	 	out	the	back	of	 it 	 s 	 	head	.
it	's	got	a	little	,	 tin 	 y 	 	 dom 	 e 	 	,	and	it	's	got	a	bunch	of	 gna 	 r 	 ly 	 	stuff	on	 it 	 s 	 	nose	.
and	then	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	thing	 call 	 ed 	 	dracorex	,	hogwart	's	eye	.
guess	where	that	came	from	?	dragon	.
so	here	's	a	dinosaur	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 spike 	 s 	 	 stick 	 ing 	 	out	of	 it 	 s 	 	head	,	no	 dom 	 e 	 	and	 gna 	 r 	 ly 	 	stuff	on	 it 	 s 	 	nose	.
 no 	 body 	 	 notice 	 d 	 	the	 gna 	 r 	 ly 	 	stuff	sort	of	 look 	 ed 	 	 a 	 like 	 	.
but	they	did	look	at	these	three	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	these	are	three	different	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	,	and	dracorex	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	most	primitive	of	them	.
and	the	other	one	is	more	primitive	than	the	other	.
it	's	 un 	 clear 	 	to	me	how	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	 sort 	 ed 	 	these	three	of	them	out	.
but	if	you	line	them	up	,	if	you	just	take	 t 	 hose 	 	three	 skull 	 s 	 	and	just	line	them	up	,	they	line	up	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
dracorex	is	the	 little 	 st 	 	one	,	stygimoloch	is	the	middle	 s 	 ize 	 	one	,	pachycephalosaurus	is	the	largest	one	.
and	one	would	think	,	that	should	give	me	a	clue	.
but	it	did	n't	give	them	a	clue	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	well	we	know	why	.
 scientist 	 s 	 	like	to	name	 thing 	 s 	 	.
so	if	we	cut	open	dracorex	--	i	cut	open	our	dracorex	--	and	look	,	it	was	spongy	 in 	 side 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	spongy	 in 	 side 	 	.
i	mean	,	it	is	a	juvenile	and	it	's	growing	 re 	 ally 	 	fast	.
so	it	is	going	to	get	 big 	 ger 	 	.
if	you	cut	open	stygimoloch	,	it	is	 do 	 ing 	 	the	same	thing	.
the	 dom 	 e 	 	,	that	little	 dom 	 e 	 	,	is	growing	 re 	 ally 	 	fast	.
it	's	 infla 	 ting 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	fast	.
what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	the	spike	on	the	back	of	the	dracorex	was	growing	 ver 	 y 	 	fast	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
the	 spike 	 s 	 	on	the	back	of	the	stygimoloch	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 resorb 	 ing 	 	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	they	're	 get 	 ting 	 	 small 	 er 	 	 a 	 s 	 	that	 dom 	 e 	 	is	 get 	 ting 	 	 big 	 ger 	 	.
and	if	we	look	at	pachycephalosaurus	,	pachycephalosaurus	 ha 	 s 	 	a	solid	 dom 	 e 	 	and	 it 	 s 	 	little	 bump 	 s 	 	on	the	back	of	 it 	 s 	 	head	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 resorb 	 ing 	 	.
so	just	with	these	three	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	,	you	can	 eas 	 ily 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	a	scientist	--	we	can	 eas 	 ily 	 	hypothesize	that	it	is	just	a	growth	 s 	 eries 	 	of	the	same	animal	.
which	of	course	 mean 	 s 	 	that	stygimoloch	and	dracorex	are	extinct	.
 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
which	of	course	 mean 	 s 	 	we	have	10	 prim 	 ary 	 	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	to	deal	with	.
so	a	 col 	 league 	 	of	mine	at	berkley	,	he	and	i	 we 	 re 	 	looking	at	triceratops	.
and	before	the	year	2000	--	now	remember	,	triceratops	was	first	found	in	the	1800s	--	before	2000	,	no	one	had	ever	 s 	 een 	 	a	juvenile	triceratops	.
there	's	a	triceratops	in	every	museum	in	the	world	,	but	no	one	had	ever	 collect 	 ed 	 	a	juvenile	.
and	we	know	why	,	right	?
 be 	 cause 	 	 every 	 body 	 	 want 	 s 	 	to	have	a	big	one	.
so	 every 	 one 	 	had	a	big	one	.
so	we	went	out	and	 collect 	 ed 	 	a	whole	bunch	of	stuff	and	we	found	a	whole	bunch	of	little	 one 	 s 	 	.
they	're	 every 	 where 	 	.	they	're	all	over	the	place	.
so	we	have	a	whole	bunch	of	them	at	our	museum	.
and	 every 	 body 	 	 say 	 s 	 	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	i	have	a	little	museum	.
when	you	have	a	little	museum	,	you	have	little	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	.
if	you	look	at	the	triceratops	,	you	can	see	it	's	changing	,	it	's	shape	-	shifting	.
 a 	 s 	 	the	 juvenile 	 s 	 	are	growing	up	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 horn 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 curv 	 e 	 	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	.
and	then	 a 	 s 	 	they	grow	 old 	 er 	 	,	the	 horn 	 s 	 	grow	forward	.
and	that	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	cool	.
if	you	look	 a 	 long 	 	the	edge	of	the	frill	,	they	have	these	little	 tri 	 angular 	 	 bone 	 s 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	grow	big	 a 	 s 	 	 triangle 	 s 	 	and	then	they	flatten	against	the	frill	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	like	the	 spike 	 s 	 	do	on	the	pachycephalosaurs	.
and	then	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 juvenile 	 s 	 	are	in	my	 collect 	 ion 	 	,	i	cut	them	open	and	look	 in 	 side 	 	.
and	the	little	one	is	 re 	 ally 	 	spongy	.
and	the	middle	 s 	 ize 	 	one	is	 re 	 ally 	 	spongy	.
but	what	was	 interest 	 ing 	 	was	the	adult	triceratops	was	 al 	 so 	 	spongy	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	skull	that	is	two	 meter 	 s 	 	long	.
it	's	a	big	skull	.
but	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	dinosaur	that	is	found	in	 th 	 is 	 	 form 	 ation 	 	that	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	triceratops	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	it	's	 big 	 ger 	 	,	and	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	torosaurus	.
and	torosaurus	,	when	we	cut	 in 	 to 	 	it	,	 ha 	 s 	 	mature	bone	.
but	it	's	got	these	big	 hole 	 s 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	shield	.
and	 every 	 body 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	a	triceratops	and	a	torosaurus	ca	n't	possibly	be	the	same	animal	 be 	 cause 	 	one	of	them	's	 big 	 ger 	 	than	the	other	one	.	``
``	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 hole 	 s 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	frill	.	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	do	we	have	any	juvenile	torosauruses	?	``
and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	no	,	but	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 hole 	 s 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	frill	.	``
so	one	of	my	graduate	 student 	 s 	 	,	john	scannella	,	 look 	 ed 	 	through	our	whole	 collect 	 ion 	 	and	he	 actual 	 ly 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	the	hole	 start 	 ing 	 	to	form	in	triceratops	and	,	of	course	it	's	open	,	in	torosaurus	--	so	he	found	the	 transit 	 ional 	 	 one 	 s 	 	between	triceratops	and	torosaurus	,	which	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	cool	.
so	now	we	know	that	torosaurus	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 grown 	 up 	 	triceratops	.
now	when	we	name	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	,	when	we	name	 any 	 thing 	 	,	the	original	name	 get 	 s 	 	to	stick	and	the	second	name	is	 throw 	 n 	 	out	.
so	torosaurus	is	extinct	.
triceratops	,	if	you	've	heard	the	news	,	a	lot	of	the	 news 	 cast 	 ers 	 	got	it	all	wrong	.
they	thought	torosaurus	should	be	 ke 	 pt 	 	and	triceratops	 throw 	 n 	 	out	,	but	that	's	not	going	to	happen	.
all	right	,	so	we	can	do	 th 	 is 	 	with	a	bunch	of	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	.
i	mean	,	here	's	edmontosaurus	and	anatotitan	.
anatotitan	:	giant	duck	.
it	's	a	giant	duck	-	bill	dinosaur	.
here	's	 an 	 other 	 	one	.
so	we	look	at	the	bone	 histo 	 logy 	 	.
the	bone	 histo 	 logy 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	us	that	edmontosaurus	is	a	juvenile	,	or	at	 l 	 east 	 	a	sub	-	adult	,	and	the	other	one	is	an	adult	and	we	have	an	 onto 	 geny 	 	.
and	we	get	rid	of	anatotitan	.
so	we	can	just	keep	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	the	last	one	is	t.	 r 	 ex 	 	.
so	there	's	these	two	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	,	t.	 r 	 ex 	 	and	nanotyrannus	.
 aga 	 in 	 	,	 make 	 s 	 	you	wonder	.
but	they	had	a	good	question	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	looking	at	them	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	one	's	got	17	 tee 	 th 	 	,	and	the	 big 	 gest 	 	one	's	got	12	 tee 	 th 	 	.
and	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	any	sense	at	all	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	do	n't	know	of	any	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	that	gain	 tee 	 th 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	get	 old 	 er 	 	.
so	it	must	be	true	--	they	must	be	different	.	``
so	we	cut	 in 	 to 	 	them	.
and	 s 	 ure 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	nanotyrannus	 ha 	 s 	 	juvenile	bone	and	the	 big 	 ger 	 	one	 ha 	 s 	 	more	mature	bone	.
it	 look 	 s 	 	like	it	could	still	get	 big 	 ger 	 	.
and	at	the	museum	of	the	rockies	where	we	work	,	i	have	four	t.	rexes	,	so	i	can	cut	a	whole	bunch	of	them	.
but	i	did	n't	have	to	cut	any	of	them	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	just	lined	up	 the 	 ir 	 	 jaw 	 s 	 	and	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	the	 big 	 gest 	 	one	had	12	 tee 	 th 	 	and	the	next	 small 	 est 	 	one	had	13	and	the	next	 small 	 est 	 	had	14	.
and	of	course	,	nano	 ha 	 s 	 	17	.
and	we	just	went	out	and	 look 	 ed 	 	at	other	people	's	 collect 	 ions 	 	and	we	found	one	that	 ha 	 s 	 	sort	of	15	 tee 	 th 	 	.
so	 aga 	 in 	 	,	real	easy	to	say	that	tyrannosaurus	 onto 	 geny 	 	 include 	 d 	 	nanotyrannus	,	and	 there 	 fore 	 	we	can	take	out	 an 	 other 	 	dinosaur	.
so	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	down	to	our	end	 cre 	 taceous 	 	,	we	have	seven	left	.
and	that	's	a	good	number	.
that	's	a	good	number	to	go	extinct	,	i	think	.
now	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	imagine	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 ver 	 y 	 	popular	with	fourth	-	graders	.
fourth	-	graders	love	 the 	 ir 	 	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	,	they	 memor 	 ize 	 	them	.
and	they	're	not	happy	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
