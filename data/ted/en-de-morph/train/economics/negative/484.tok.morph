it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 al 	 most 	 	20	 year 	 s 	 	ago	when	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 re 	 frame 	 	the	way	we	use	information	,	the	way	we	work	together	:	i	 invent 	 ed 	 	the	world	wide	web	.
now	,	20	 year 	 s 	 	on	,	at	ted	,	i	want	to	ask	your	help	in	a	new	 re 	 framing 	 	.
so	going	back	to	1989	,	i	wrote	a	memo	 suggest 	 ing 	 	the	global	 hyper 	 text 	 	system	.
 no 	 body 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	did	 any 	 thing 	 	with	it	,	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	.
but	18	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	 innov 	 ation 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	--	18	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	my	 bo 	 s 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	i	could	do	it	on	the	side	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	sort	of	a	play	project	,	kick	the	 tire 	 s 	 	of	a	new	computer	we	'd	got	.
and	so	he	 g 	 ave 	 	me	the	time	to	code	it	up	.
so	i	 bas 	 ically 	 	 rough 	 ed 	 	out	what	html	should	look	like	:	 hyper 	 text 	 	 proto 	 col 	 	,	http	;	the	idea	of	urls	,	these	 name 	 s 	 	for	 thing 	 s 	 	which	 start 	 ed 	 	with	http	.
i	wrote	the	code	and	put	it	out	there	.
why	did	i	do	it	?
well	,	it	was	 bas 	 ically 	 	 frust 	 ration 	 	.
i	was	 frust 	 rated 	 	--	i	was	 work 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 soft 	 ware 	 	engineer	in	 th 	 is 	 	huge	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	lab	,	 lot 	 s 	 	of	people	coming	from	all	over	the	world	.
they	 br 	 ought 	 	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	different	 computer 	 s 	 	with	them	.
they	had	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	different	data	 format 	 s 	 	,	all	 sort 	 s 	 	,	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 document 	 ation 	 	 system 	 s 	 	.
so	that	,	in	all	that	 divers 	 ity 	 	,	if	i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	figure	out	how	to	build	 some 	 thing 	 	out	of	a	bit	of	 th 	 is 	 	and	a	bit	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	i	 look 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	,	i	had	to	connect	to	some	new	machine	,	i	had	to	learn	to	run	some	new	program	,	i	would	find	the	information	i	 want 	 ed 	 	in	some	new	data	format	.
and	these	 we 	 re 	 	all	 in 	 compatible 	 	.
it	was	just	 ver 	 y 	 	 frust 	 rating 	 	.
the	 frust 	 ration 	 	was	all	 th 	 is 	 	 un 	 lock 	 ed 	 	potential	.
in	fact	,	on	all	these	 dis 	 c 	 s 	 	there	 we 	 re 	 	 document 	 s 	 	.
so	if	you	just	 imagin 	 ed 	 	them	all	 be 	 ing 	 	part	of	some	big	,	virtual	 document 	 ation 	 	system	in	the	sky	,	say	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	then	life	would	be	so	much	 eas 	 ier 	 	.
well	,	once	you	've	had	an	idea	like	that	it	kind	of	 get 	 s 	 	under	your	skin	and	even	if	people	do	n't	read	your	memo	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	he	did	,	it	was	found	after	he	 di 	 ed 	 	,	his	copy	.
he	had	written	,	``	vague	,	but	 excit 	 ing 	 	,	``	in	pencil	,	in	the	corner	.
but	in	general	it	was	difficult	--	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	difficult	to	explain	what	the	web	was	like	.
it	's	difficult	to	explain	to	people	now	that	it	was	difficult	then	.
but	then	--	ok	,	when	ted	 start 	 ed 	 	,	there	was	no	web	so	 thing 	 s 	 	like	``	click	``	did	n't	have	the	same	meaning	.
i	can	show	 some 	 body 	 	a	piece	of	 hyper 	 text 	 	,	a	page	which	 ha 	 s 	 	got	 link 	 s 	 	,	and	we	click	on	the	link	and	bing	--	there	'll	be	 an 	 other 	 	 hyper 	 text 	 	page	.
not	 impress 	 ive 	 	.
you	know	,	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	that	--	we	've	got	 thing 	 s 	 	on	 hyper 	 text 	 	on	cd	-	roms	.
what	was	difficult	was	to	get	them	to	imagine	:	so	,	imagine	that	that	link	could	have	gone	to	 virtual 	 ly 	 	any	document	you	could	imagine	.
 al 	 right 	 	,	that	is	the	leap	that	was	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	for	people	to	make	.
well	,	some	people	did	.
so	 yea 	 h 	 	,	it	was	difficult	to	explain	,	but	there	was	a	 grass 	 root 	 s 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	.
and	that	is	what	 ha 	 s 	 	made	it	most	 f 	 un 	 	.
that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	the	most	 excit 	 ing 	 	thing	,	not	the	technology	,	not	the	 thing 	 s 	 	people	have	 d 	 one 	 	with	it	,	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	community	,	the	spirit	of	all	these	people	 get 	 ting 	 	together	,	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	the	 email 	 s 	 	.
that	's	what	it	was	like	then	.
do	you	know	what	?	it	's	funny	,	but	right	now	it	's	kind	of	like	that	 aga 	 in 	 	.
i	 ask 	 ed 	 	 every 	 body 	 	,	more	or	less	,	to	put	 the 	 ir 	 	 document 	 s 	 	--	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	could	you	put	your	 document 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	web	thing	?	``
and	you	did	.
 thank 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	blast	,	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	it	?
i	mean	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	've	found	out	that	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	happen	with	the	web	 re 	 ally 	 	sort	of	blow	us	away	.
they	're	much	more	than	we	'd	 original 	 ly 	 	 imagin 	 ed 	 	when	we	put	together	the	little	,	 initi 	 al 	 	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	that	we	 start 	 ed 	 	off	with	.
now	,	i	want	you	to	put	your	data	on	the	web	.
 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	there	is	still	huge	 un 	 lock 	 ed 	 	potential	.
there	is	still	a	huge	 frust 	 ration 	 	that	people	have	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	n't	got	data	on	the	web	 a 	 s 	 	data	.
what	do	you	mean	,	``	data	``	?	what	's	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	--	 document 	 s 	 	,	data	?
well	,	 document 	 s 	 	you	read	,	ok	?
more	or	less	,	you	read	them	,	you	can	follow	 link 	 s 	 	from	them	,	and	that	's	it	.
data	--	you	can	do	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	stuff	with	a	computer	.
who	was	here	or	 ha 	 s 	 	 other 	 wise 	 	 s 	 een 	 	hans	rosling	's	talk	?
one	of	the	great	--	 y 	 es 	 	a	lot	of	people	have	 s 	 een 	 	it	--	one	of	the	great	ted	 talk 	 s 	 	.
hans	put	up	 th 	 is 	 	 present 	 ation 	 	in	which	he	 show 	 ed 	 	,	for	 vari 	 ous 	 	different	 count 	 ries 	 	,	in	 vari 	 ous 	 	different	 color 	 s 	 	--	he	 show 	 ed 	 	income	 level 	 s 	 	on	one	axis	and	he	 show 	 ed 	 	infant	 mortal 	 ity 	 	,	and	he	shot	 th 	 is 	 	thing	 animate 	 d 	 	through	time	.
so	,	he	'd	taken	 th 	 is 	 	data	and	made	a	 present 	 ation 	 	which	just	 shatter 	 ed 	 	a	lot	of	 myth 	 s 	 	that	people	had	about	the	 economic 	 s 	 	in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	.
he	put	up	a	slide	a	little	bit	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
it	had	 under 	 ground 	 	all	the	data	ok	,	data	is	 brow 	 n 	 	and	 box 	 y 	 	and	 bor 	 ing 	 	,	and	that	's	how	we	think	of	it	,	is	n't	it	?
 be 	 cause 	 	data	you	ca	n't	 natural 	 ly 	 	use	by	 it 	 self 	 	but	in	fact	,	data	 drive 	 s 	 	a	huge	amount	of	what	 happen 	 s 	 	in	our	 live 	 s 	 	and	it	 happen 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 some 	 body 	 	 take 	 s 	 	that	data	and	 do 	 es 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	with	it	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	hans	had	put	the	data	together	he	had	found	from	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 unit 	 ed 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	 web 	 s 	 ites 	 	and	 thing 	 s 	 	.
he	had	put	it	together	,	 combine 	 d 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	than	the	original	 piece 	 s 	 	and	then	he	'd	put	it	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 soft 	 ware 	 	,	which	i	think	his	son	 develop 	 ed 	 	,	 original 	 ly 	 	,	and	 produce 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 present 	 ation 	 	.
and	hans	made	a	point	of	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	look	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	have	a	lot	of	data	.	``
and	i	was	happy	to	see	that	at	the	party	last	night	that	he	was	still	 say 	 ing 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 for 	 c 	 ibly 	 	,	``	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	have	a	lot	of	data	.	``
so	i	want	us	now	to	think	about	not	just	two	 piece 	 s 	 	of	data	 be 	 ing 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	,	or	six	like	he	did	,	but	i	want	to	think	about	a	world	where	 every 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	put	data	on	the	web	and	so	 virtual 	 ly 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	you	can	imagine	is	on	the	web	and	then	 call 	 ing 	 	that	linked	data	.
the	technology	is	linked	data	,	and	it	's	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	simple	.
if	you	want	to	put	 some 	 thing 	 	on	the	web	there	are	three	 rule 	 s 	 	:	first	thing	is	that	 t 	 hose 	 	http	 name 	 s 	 	--	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	start	with	``	http	:	``	--	we	're	using	them	not	just	for	 document 	 s 	 	now	,	we	're	using	them	for	 thing 	 s 	 	that	the	 document 	 s 	 	are	about	.
we	're	using	them	for	people	,	we	're	using	them	for	 place 	 s 	 	,	we	're	using	them	for	your	 product 	 s 	 	,	we	're	using	them	for	 event 	 s 	 	.
all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	conceptual	 thing 	 s 	 	,	they	have	 name 	 s 	 	now	that	start	with	http	.
second	rule	,	if	i	take	one	of	these	http	 name 	 s 	 	and	i	look	it	up	and	i	do	the	web	thing	with	it	and	i	fetch	the	data	using	the	http	 proto 	 col 	 	from	the	web	,	i	will	get	back	some	data	in	a	standard	format	which	is	kind	of	 use 	 ful 	 	data	that	 some 	 body 	 	might	like	to	know	about	that	thing	,	about	that	event	.
who	's	at	the	event	?	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	about	that	person	,	where	they	 we 	 re 	 	born	,	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	.
so	the	second	rule	is	i	get	 import 	 ant 	 	information	back	.
third	rule	is	that	when	i	get	back	that	information	it	's	not	just	got	 some 	 body 	 	's	height	and	weight	and	when	they	 we 	 re 	 	born	,	it	's	got	 relationship 	 s 	 	.
data	is	 relationship 	 s 	 	.
 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	data	is	 relationship 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	person	was	born	in	berlin	;	berlin	is	in	germany	.
and	when	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 relationship 	 s 	 	,	 when 	 ever 	 	it	 express 	 es 	 	a	relationship	then	the	other	thing	that	it	's	related	to	is	 give 	 n 	 	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 name 	 s 	 	that	 start 	 s 	 	http	.
so	,	i	can	go	 a 	 head 	 	and	look	that	thing	up	.
so	i	look	up	a	person	--	i	can	look	up	then	the	city	where	they	 we 	 re 	 	born	;	then	i	can	look	up	the	region	it	's	in	,	and	the	town	it	's	in	,	and	the	population	of	it	,	and	so	on	.
so	i	can	 brow 	 s 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	.
so	that	's	it	,	 re 	 ally 	 	.
that	is	linked	data	.
i	wrote	an	article	 en 	 titled 	 	``	linked	data	``	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	and	soon	after	that	,	 thing 	 s 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	to	happen	.
the	idea	of	linked	data	is	that	we	get	 lot 	 s 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	these	boxes	that	hans	had	,	and	we	get	 lot 	 s 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	 sprout 	 ing 	 	.
it	's	not	just	a	whole	lot	of	other	 plant 	 s 	 	.
it	's	not	just	a	root	 supply 	 ing 	 	a	plant	,	but	for	each	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 plant 	 s 	 	,	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	--	a	 present 	 ation 	 	,	an	analysis	,	 some 	 body 	 	's	looking	for	 pattern 	 s 	 	in	the	data	--	they	get	to	look	at	all	the	data	and	they	get	it	 connect 	 ed 	 	together	,	and	the	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	about	data	is	the	more	 thing 	 s 	 	you	have	to	connect	together	,	the	more	 power 	 ful 	 	it	is	.
so	,	linked	data	.
the	meme	went	out	there	.
and	,	 pre 	 tty 	 	soon	chris	bizer	at	the	freie	universitat	in	berlin	who	was	one	of	the	first	people	to	put	 interest 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	up	,	he	 notice 	 d 	 	that	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	--	you	know	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	,	the	 on 	 line 	 	encyclopedia	with	 lot 	 s 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	 document 	 s 	 	in	it	.
well	,	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 document 	 s 	 	,	there	are	little	 square 	 s 	 	,	little	boxes	.
and	in	most	information	boxes	,	there	's	data	.
so	he	wrote	a	program	to	take	the	data	,	 ex 	 tract 	 	it	from	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	,	and	put	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	blob	of	linked	data	on	the	web	,	which	he	 call 	 ed 	 	 d 	 b 	 pedia 	 	.
 d 	 b 	 pedia 	 	is	 represent 	 ed 	 	by	the	blue	blob	in	the	middle	of	 th 	 is 	 	slide	and	if	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	go	and	look	up	berlin	,	you	'll	find	that	there	are	other	 blob 	 s 	 	of	data	which	 al 	 so 	 	have	stuff	about	berlin	,	and	they	're	linked	together	.
so	if	you	pull	the	data	from	 d 	 b 	 pedia 	 	about	berlin	,	you	'll	end	up	 pull 	 ing 	 	up	these	other	 thing 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
and	the	 excit 	 ing 	 	thing	is	it	's	 start 	 ing 	 	to	grow	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	just	the	 grass 	 root 	 s 	 	stuff	 aga 	 in 	 	,	ok	?
let	's	think	about	data	for	a	bit	.
data	 come 	 s 	 	in	fact	in	 lot 	 s 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	different	 form 	 s 	 	think	of	the	 divers 	 ity 	 	of	the	web	.	it	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	that	the	web	 allow 	 s 	 	you	to	put	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	data	up	there	.
so	it	is	with	data	.	i	could	talk	about	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	data	.
we	could	talk	about	government	data	,	enterprise	data	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	there	's	scientific	data	,	there	's	personal	data	,	there	's	weather	data	,	there	's	data	about	 event 	 s 	 	,	there	's	data	about	 talk 	 s 	 	,	and	there	's	news	and	there	's	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	stuff	.
i	'm	just	going	to	 ment 	 ion 	 	a	few	of	them	so	that	you	get	the	idea	of	the	 divers 	 ity 	 	of	it	,	so	that	you	 al 	 so 	 	see	how	much	 un 	 lock 	 ed 	 	potential	.
let	's	start	with	government	data	.
barack	obama	 s 	 aid 	 	in	a	speech	,	that	he	--	american	government	data	would	be	 avail 	 able 	 	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	in	 access 	 ible 	 	 format 	 s 	 	.
and	i	hope	that	they	will	put	it	up	 a 	 s 	 	linked	data	.
that	's	 import 	 ant 	 	.	why	is	it	 import 	 ant 	 	?
not	just	for	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	,	 yea 	 h 	 	 trans 	 par 	 ency 	 	in	government	is	 import 	 ant 	 	,	but	that	data	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	data	from	all	the	government	 depart 	 ments 	 	think	about	how	much	of	that	data	is	about	how	life	is	lived	in	america	.
it	's	actual	 use 	 ful 	 	.	it	's	got	value	.
i	can	use	it	in	my	company	.
i	could	use	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	kid	to	do	my	 home 	 work 	 	.
so	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	making	the	place	,	making	the	world	run	better	by	making	 th 	 is 	 	data	 avail 	 able 	 	.
in	fact	if	you	're	 respons 	 ible 	 	--	if	you	know	about	some	data	in	a	government	 depart 	 ment 	 	,	often	you	find	that	these	people	,	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 tempt 	 ed 	 	to	keep	it	--	hans	 call 	 s 	 	it	 data 	 base 	 	 hugg 	 ing 	 	.
you	hug	your	 data 	 base 	 	,	you	do	n't	want	to	let	it	go	 un 	 til 	 	you	've	made	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	for	it	.
well	,	i	'd	like	to	suggest	that	 ra 	 ther 	 	--	 y 	 es 	 	,	make	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	who	am	i	to	say	do	n't	make	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	?
make	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	but	first	give	us	the	 un 	 adult 	 er 	 ated 	 	data	,	we	want	the	data	.
we	want	 un 	 adult 	 er 	 ated 	 	data	.
ok	,	we	have	to	ask	for	raw	data	now	.
and	i	'm	going	to	ask	you	to	practice	that	,	ok	?
can	you	say	``	raw	``	?
audience	:	raw	.
tim	berners	-	lee	:	can	you	say	``	data	``	?
audience	:	data	.
tbl	:	can	you	say	``	now	``	?
audience	:	now	!
tbl	:	 al 	 right 	 	,	``	raw	data	now	``	!
audience	:	raw	data	now	!
practice	that	.	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	you	have	no	idea	the	number	of	 excuse 	 s 	 	people	come	up	with	to	hang	onto	 the 	 ir 	 	data	and	not	give	it	to	you	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	you	've	paid	for	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	taxpayer	.
and	it	's	not	just	america	.	it	's	all	over	the	world	.
and	it	's	not	just	 government 	 s 	 	,	of	course	--	it	's	 enterprise 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
so	i	'm	just	going	to	 ment 	 ion 	 	a	few	other	 thought 	 s 	 	on	data	.
here	we	are	at	ted	,	and	all	the	time	we	are	 ver 	 y 	 	conscious	of	the	huge	 challeng 	 es 	 	that	human	 socie 	 ty 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	right	now	--	 cur 	 ing 	 	cancer	,	 understand 	 ing 	 	the	brain	for	alzheimer	's	,	 understand 	 ing 	 	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	to	make	it	a	little	bit	more	 s 	 table 	 	,	 understand 	 ing 	 	how	the	world	 work 	 s 	 	.
the	people	who	are	going	to	solve	 t 	 hose 	 	--	the	 scientist 	 s 	 	--	they	have	half	-	 form 	 ed 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	head	,	they	try	to	communicate	 t 	 hose 	 	over	the	web	.
but	a	lot	of	the	state	of	knowledge	of	the	human	race	at	the	moment	is	on	 data 	 base 	 s 	 	,	often	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	,	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 current 	 ly 	 	not	 share 	 d 	 	.
in	fact	,	i	'll	just	go	 in 	 to 	 	one	area	--	if	you	're	looking	at	alzheimer	's	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	drug	 discover 	 y 	 	--	there	is	a	whole	lot	of	linked	data	which	is	just	coming	out	 be 	 cause 	 	 scientist 	 s 	 	in	that	field	 real 	 ize 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	great	way	of	 get 	 ting 	 	out	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 s 	 ilo 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	had	 the 	 ir 	 	 genomic 	 s 	 	data	in	one	 data 	 base 	 	in	one	building	,	and	they	had	 the 	 ir 	 	protein	data	in	 an 	 other 	 	.
now	,	they	are	 stick 	 ing 	 	it	onto	--	linked	data	--	and	now	they	can	ask	the	sort	of	question	,	that	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	would	n't	ask	,	i	would	n't	ask	--	they	would	.
what	 protein 	 s 	 	are	 involve 	 d 	 	in	signal	 trans 	 duct 	 ion 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	related	to	 pyramid 	 al 	 	 neuro 	 ns 	 	?
well	,	you	take	that	 mouth 	 ful 	 	and	you	put	it	 in 	 to 	 	google	.
of	course	,	there	's	no	page	on	the	web	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 answer 	 ed 	 	that	question	 be 	 cause 	 	 no 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	that	question	before	.
you	get	223,000	 hit 	 s 	 	--	no	 result 	 s 	 	you	can	use	.
you	ask	the	linked	data	--	which	they	've	now	put	together	--	32	 hit 	 s 	 	,	each	of	which	is	a	protein	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 proper 	 ties 	 	and	you	can	look	at	.
the	power	of	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	ask	 t 	 hose 	 	 question 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	scientist	--	 question 	 s 	 	which	 actual 	 ly 	 	bridge	 a 	 cross 	 	different	 discipline 	 s 	 	--	is	 re 	 ally 	 	a	complete	sea	change	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
 scientist 	 s 	 	are	 total 	 ly 	 	 s 	 ty 	 mi 	 ed 	 	at	the	moment	--	the	power	of	the	data	that	other	 scientist 	 s 	 	have	 collect 	 ed 	 	is	 lock 	 ed 	 	up	and	we	need	to	get	it	 un 	 lock 	 ed 	 	so	we	can	tackle	 t 	 hose 	 	huge	 problem 	 s 	 	.
now	if	i	go	on	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	'll	think	that	all	the	data	 come 	 s 	 	from	huge	 institution 	 s 	 	and	 ha 	 s 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	you	.
but	,	that	's	not	true	.
in	fact	,	data	is	about	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
you	just	--	you	log	on	to	your	social	 network 	 ing 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	your	 favor 	 ite 	 	one	,	you	say	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	friend	.	``
bing	!	relationship	.	data	.
you	say	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	photograph	,	it	's	about	--	it	 depict 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	person	.	``	bing	!	that	's	data	.	data	,	data	,	data	.
every	time	you	do	 thing 	 s 	 	on	the	social	 network 	 ing 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	the	social	 network 	 ing 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	is	taking	data	and	using	it	--	re	-	purposing	it	--	and	using	it	to	make	other	people	's	 live 	 s 	 	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	on	the	 s 	 ite 	 	.
but	,	when	you	go	to	 an 	 other 	 	linked	data	 s 	 ite 	 	--	and	let	's	say	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	about	travel	,	and	you	say	,	``	i	want	to	 s 	 end 	 	 th 	 is 	 	photo	to	all	the	people	in	that	group	,	``	you	ca	n't	get	over	the	 wall 	 s 	 	.
the	economist	wrote	an	article	about	it	,	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	people	have	 blog 	 ged 	 	about	it	--	tremendous	 frust 	 ration 	 	.
the	way	to	break	down	the	 s 	 ilo 	 s 	 	is	to	get	inter	-	operability	between	social	 network 	 ing 	 	 s 	 ites 	 	.
we	need	to	do	that	with	linked	data	.
one	last	type	of	data	i	'll	talk	about	,	 may 	 be 	 	it	's	the	most	 excit 	 ing 	 	.
before	i	came	down	here	,	i	 look 	 ed 	 	it	up	on	openstreetmap	the	openstreetmap	's	a	map	,	but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	wiki	.
zoom	in	and	that	square	thing	is	a	theater	--	which	we	're	in	right	now	--	the	 ter 	 race 	 	theater	.	it	did	n't	have	a	name	on	it	.
so	i	could	go	 in 	 to 	 	edit	mode	,	i	could	select	the	theater	,	i	could	add	down	at	the	bottom	the	name	,	and	i	could	 s 	 ave 	 	it	back	.
and	now	if	you	go	back	to	the	openstreetmap	.	org	,	and	you	find	 th 	 is 	 	place	,	you	will	find	that	the	 ter 	 race 	 	theater	 ha 	 s 	 	got	a	name	.
i	did	that	.	me	!
i	did	that	to	the	map	.	i	just	did	that	!
i	put	that	up	on	there	.	 he 	 y 	 	,	you	know	what	?
if	i	--	that	street	map	is	all	about	 every 	 body 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	bit	and	it	 create 	 s 	 	an	 in 	 credible 	 	resource	 be 	 cause 	 	 every 	 body 	 	else	 do 	 es 	 	 the 	 ir 	 s 	 	.
and	that	is	what	linked	data	is	all	about	.
it	's	about	people	 do 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	bit	to	produce	a	little	bit	,	and	it	all	 connect 	 ing 	 	.
that	's	how	linked	data	 work 	 s 	 	.
you	do	your	bit	.	 every 	 body 	 	else	 do 	 es 	 	 the 	 ir 	 s 	 	.
you	may	not	have	 lot 	 s 	 	of	data	which	you	have	 your 	 self 	 	to	put	on	there	but	you	know	to	demand	it	.
and	we	've	 practice 	 d 	 	that	.
so	,	linked	data	--	it	's	huge	.
i	've	 on 	 ly 	 	told	you	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	number	of	 thing 	 s 	 	there	are	data	in	every	 a 	 spect 	 	of	our	 live 	 s 	 	,	every	 a 	 spect 	 	of	work	and	pleasure	,	and	it	's	not	just	about	the	number	of	 place 	 s 	 	where	data	 come 	 s 	 	,	it	's	about	 connect 	 ing 	 	it	together	.
and	when	you	connect	data	together	,	you	get	power	in	a	way	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	happen	just	with	the	web	,	with	 document 	 s 	 	.
you	get	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	huge	power	out	of	it	.
so	,	we	're	at	the	stage	now	where	we	have	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	--	the	people	who	think	it	's	a	great	idea	.
and	all	the	people	--	and	i	think	there	's	a	lot	of	people	at	ted	who	do	 thing 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	--	even	 th 	 ough 	 	there	's	not	an	 im 	 mediate 	 	return	on	the	 invest 	 ment 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	will	 on 	 ly 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	pay	off	when	 every 	 body 	 	else	 ha 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	it	--	they	'll	do	it	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	the	sort	of	person	who	just	 do 	 es 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	which	would	be	good	if	 every 	 body 	 	else	did	them	.
ok	,	so	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	linked	data	.
i	want	you	to	make	it	.
i	want	you	to	demand	it	.
and	i	think	it	's	an	idea	worth	 spread 	 ing 	 	.
 thank 	 s 	 	.
