and	it	's	 clear 	 ly 	 	in	the	area	of	finance	.
with	 institution 	 s 	 	 establish 	 ed 	 	to	think	about	the	future	,	the	imf	,	the	bis	,	the	financial	 st 	 ability 	 	forum	,	could	n't	see	what	was	coming	.

 global 	 ization 	 	is	 get 	 ting 	 	more	complex	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	change	is	 get 	 ting 	 	more	rapid	.
the	future	will	be	more	 un 	 predict 	 able 	 	.
 urban 	 ization 	 	,	 integ 	 ration 	 	,	coming	together	,	 lead 	 s 	 	to	a	new	 ren 	 aiss 	 ance 	 	.
it	did	 th 	 is 	 	a	thousand	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
the	last	40	 year 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 time 	 s 	 	.
life	 expect 	 ancy 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	up	by	about	25	 year 	 s 	 	.
it	took	from	the	stone	age	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	that	.
income	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	up	for	a	 major 	 ity 	 	of	the	world	's	population	,	 de 	 spite 	 	the	population	going	up	by	about	two	billion	people	over	 th 	 is 	 	period	.
and	 il 	 liter 	 acy 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	down	,	from	a	half	to	about	a	quarter	of	the	people	on	earth	.
a	huge	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	,	 unleash 	 ing 	 	of	new	potential	for	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	for	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
but	there	is	an	 under 	 bel 	 ly 	 	.
there	are	two	 a 	 chill 	 es 	 	'	 heel 	 s 	 	of	 global 	 ization 	 	.
there	is	the	 a 	 chill 	 es 	 	'	heel	of	growing	 ine 	 quality 	 	--	 t 	 hose 	 	that	are	left	out	,	 t 	 hose 	 	that	feel	 ang 	 ry 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	that	are	not	 particip 	 ating 	 	.	 global 	 ization 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 be 	 en 	 	inclusive	.
the	second	 a 	 chill 	 es 	 	'	heel	is	 complex 	 ity 	 	--	a	growing	 f 	 rag 	 ility 	 	,	a	growing	 brittle 	 ness 	 	.
what	 happen 	 s 	 	in	one	place	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	 affect 	 s 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	else	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 system 	 ic 	 	risk	,	 system 	 ic 	 	shock	.
we	've	 s 	 een 	 	it	in	the	financial	crisis	.	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	it	in	the	 pan 	 demic 	 	flu	.
it	will	 be 	 come 	 	 virul 	 ent 	 	and	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	we	have	to	build	 resili 	 ence 	 	against	.
a	lot	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	driven	by	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	technology	.
there	have	 be 	 en 	 	huge	 leap 	 s 	 	.	there	will	be	a	million	-	fold	 improve 	 ment 	 	in	what	you	can	get	for	the	same	price	in	computing	by	2030	.
that	's	what	the	experience	of	the	last	20	 year 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	.
it	will	 continu 	 e 	 	.
our	 computer 	 s 	 	,	our	 system 	 s 	 	will	be	 a 	 s 	 	primitive	 a 	 s 	 	the	apollo	's	are	for	 to 	 day 	 	.
our	mobile	 phone 	 s 	 	are	more	 power 	 ful 	 	than	the	total	apollo	space	engine	.
our	mobile	 phone 	 s 	 	are	more	 power 	 ful 	 	than	some	of	the	 strong 	 est 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	of	20	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
so	what	will	 th 	 is 	 	do	?
it	will	create	huge	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	in	technology	.
 miniatur 	 ization 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
there	will	be	 in 	 visible 	 	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	.	 in 	 visible 	 	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	in	our	bodies	,	in	our	 brain 	 s 	 	,	and	in	the	air	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	dust	mite	on	a	 nano 	 replica 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	ability	to	do	 every 	 thing 	 	in	new	ways	 unleash 	 es 	 	potential	,	not	 l 	 east 	 	in	the	area	of	medicine	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	stem	cell	that	we	've	 develop 	 ed 	 	here	in	oxford	,	from	an	 embryo 	 nic 	 	stem	cell	.
we	can	develop	any	part	of	the	body	.
 increasing 	 ly 	 	,	over	time	,	 th 	 is 	 	will	be	possible	from	our	own	skin	--	able	to	replicate	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	body	.
fantastic	potential	for	 re 	 generative 	 	medicine	.
i	do	n't	think	there	will	be	a	special	olympics	long	after	2030	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	 re 	 generate 	 	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	body	.
but	the	question	is	,	``	who	will	have	it	?	``
the	other	major	 develop 	 ment 	 	is	going	to	be	in	the	area	of	what	can	happen	in	 genetic 	 s 	 	.
the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	create	,	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	mouse	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 genetic 	 ally 	 	 modifi 	 ed 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	which	 go 	 es 	 	three	 time 	 s 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	,	 last 	 s 	 	for	three	 time 	 s 	 	 long 	 er 	 	,	we	could	produce	,	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	mouse	can	,	to	the	age	of	our	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	80	 year 	 s 	 	,	using	about	the	same	amount	of	food	.
but	will	 th 	 is 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	be	 avail 	 able 	 	for	the	super	rich	,	for	 t 	 hose 	 	that	can	afford	it	?	are	we	headed	for	a	new	eugenics	?
will	 on 	 ly 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	that	are	able	to	afford	it	be	able	to	be	 th 	 is 	 	super	race	of	the	future	?
so	the	big	question	for	us	is	,	``	how	do	we	manage	 th 	 is 	 	 techno 	 logical 	 	change	?	``
how	do	we	ensure	that	it	 create 	 s 	 	a	more	inclusive	technology	,	a	technology	which	 mean 	 s 	 	that	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	grow	 old 	 er 	 	,	that	we	can	 al 	 so 	 	grow	 wis 	 er 	 	,	and	that	we	're	able	to	support	the	 population 	 s 	 	of	the	future	?
one	of	the	most	 dramat 	 ic 	 	 manifest 	 ations 	 	of	these	 improve 	 ments 	 	will	be	moving	from	population	 pyramid 	 s 	 	to	what	we	might	term	population	 coffin 	 s 	 	.
there	is	 un 	 like 	 ly 	 	to	be	a	pension	or	a	 retire 	 ment 	 	age	in	2030	.
these	will	be	 red 	 un 	 d 	 ant 	 	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	.	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	 on 	 ly 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	of	the	west	.
the	most	 dramat 	 ic 	 	 change 	 s 	 	will	be	the	 sky 	 scrap 	 er 	 	type	of	new	 pyramid 	 s 	 	that	will	take	place	in	 chin 	 a 	 	and	in	 man 	 y 	 	other	 count 	 ries 	 	.
so	forget	about	 retire 	 ments 	 	if	you	're	young	.
forget	about	 pension 	 s 	 	.	think	about	life	and	where	it	's	going	to	be	going	.
of	course	,	 migr 	 ation 	 	will	 be 	 come 	 	even	more	 import 	 ant 	 	.
the	war	on	talent	,	the	need	to	attract	people	at	all	skill	 range 	 s 	 	,	to	push	us	around	in	our	 wheelchair 	 s 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	to	drive	our	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	.	our	 innov 	 ation 	 	will	be	vital	.
the	 employ 	 ment 	 	in	the	rich	 count 	 ries 	 	will	go	down	from	about	800	to	about	700	million	of	these	people	.
 th 	 is 	 	would	 imp 	 ly 	 	a	massive	leap	in	 migr 	 ation 	 	.
so	the	 concern 	 s 	 	,	the	 xeno 	 phobic 	 	 concern 	 s 	 	of	 to 	 day 	 	,	of	 migr 	 ation 	 	,	will	be	 turn 	 ed 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	head	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	search	for	people	to	help	us	sort	out	our	 pension 	 s 	 	and	our	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	in	the	future	.
and	then	,	the	 system 	 ic 	 	 risk 	 s 	 	.
we	understand	that	these	will	 be 	 come 	 	much	more	 virul 	 ent 	 	,	that	what	we	see	 to 	 day 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	 inter 	 weaving 	 	of	 socie 	 ties 	 	,	of	 system 	 s 	 	,	 fast 	 ened 	 	by	 techno 	 logies 	 	and	 ha 	 sten 	 ed 	 	by	just	-	in	-	time	management	 system 	 s 	 	.
small	 level 	 s 	 	of	stock	push	 resili 	 ence 	 	 in 	 to 	 	other	people	's	 respons 	 ibility 	 	.
the	collapse	in	 bio 	 divers 	 ity 	 	,	climate	change	,	 pan 	 demic 	 s 	 	,	financial	 cri 	 s 	 es 	 	:	these	will	be	the	 curr 	 ency 	 	that	we	will	think	about	.
and	so	a	new	 aware 	 ness 	 	will	have	to	arise	,	of	how	we	deal	with	these	,	how	we	mobilize	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	in	a	new	way	,	and	come	together	 a 	 s 	 	a	community	to	manage	 system 	 ic 	 	risk	.
it	's	going	to	 requir 	 e 	 	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
it	's	going	to	 requir 	 e 	 	an	 understand 	 ing 	 	that	the	 glor 	 y 	 	of	 global 	 ization 	 	could	 al 	 so 	 	be	 it 	 s 	 	 down 	 fall 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	could	be	our	best	century	ever	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 achiev 	 ement 	 s 	 	,	or	it	could	be	our	worst	.
and	of	course	we	need	to	worry	about	the	 individual 	 s 	 	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	the	 individual 	 s 	 	that	feel	that	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	left	out	in	one	way	or	 an 	 other 	 	.
an	individual	,	for	the	first	time	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 human 	 ity 	 	,	will	have	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	,	by	2030	,	to	destroy	the	planet	,	to	wreck	 every 	 thing 	 	,	through	the	creation	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	of	a	 bio 	 pathogen 	 	.
how	do	we	begin	to	weave	these	 tape 	 s 	 tries 	 	together	?
how	do	we	think	about	complex	 system 	 s 	 	in	new	ways	?
that	will	be	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	of	the	 scholar 	 s 	 	,	and	of	all	of	us	 engag 	 ed 	 	in	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	future	.
the	rest	of	our	 live 	 s 	 	will	be	in	the	future	.	we	need	to	 prep 	 are 	 	for	it	now	.
we	need	to	understand	that	the	 govern 	 ance 	 	structure	in	the	world	is	 fossil 	 ized 	 	.
it	can	not	begin	to	cope	with	the	 challeng 	 es 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	will	 br 	 ing 	 	.
we	have	to	develop	a	new	way	of	 man 	 aging 	 	the	planet	,	 collect 	 ively 	 	,	through	 collect 	 ive 	 	 wis 	 dom 	 	.
we	know	,	and	i	know	from	my	own	experience	,	that	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	can	happen	,	when	 individual 	 s 	 	and	 socie 	 ties 	 	come	together	to	change	 the 	 ir 	 	future	.
i	left	south	africa	,	and	15	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	after	 think 	 ing 	 	i	would	never	go	back	,	i	had	the	privilege	and	the	honor	to	work	in	the	government	of	nelson	mandela	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	a	miracle	.	we	can	create	 miracle 	 s 	 	,	 collect 	 ively 	 	,	in	our	 life 	 time 	 	.
it	is	vital	that	we	do	so	.
it	is	vital	that	the	 idea 	 s 	 	that	are	 nurture 	 d 	 	in	ted	,	that	the	 idea 	 s 	 	that	we	think	about	look	forward	,	and	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	will	be	the	most	 glor 	 ious 	 	century	,	and	not	one	of	eco	-	disaster	and	eco	-	collapse	.
thank	you	.
