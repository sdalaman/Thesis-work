my	name	is	ryan	lobo	,	and	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	the	 document 	 ary 	 	 film 	 making 	 	business	all	over	the	world	for	the	last	10	 year 	 s 	 	.
 dur 	 ing 	 	the	process	of	making	these	 film 	 s 	 	i	found	 my 	 self 	 	taking	 photograph 	 s 	 	,	often	much	to	the	 annoy 	 ance 	 	of	the	video	 camera 	 men 	 	.
i	found	 th 	 is 	 	 photograph 	 y 	 	of	mine	 al 	 most 	 	compulsive	.
and	at	the	end	of	a	shoot	,	i	would	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	feel	that	i	had	 photograph 	 s 	 	that	told	a	better	story	than	a	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	-	sensational	 document 	 ary 	 	.
i	felt	,	when	i	had	my	 photograph 	 s 	 	,	that	i	was	 hold 	 ing 	 	on	to	 some 	 thing 	 	true	,	 regard 	 less 	 	of	 agenda 	 s 	 	or	 politic 	 s 	 	.
in	2007	,	i	 travel 	 ed 	 	to	three	war	 zone 	 s 	 	.
i	 travel 	 ed 	 	to	 ir 	 aq 	 	,	afghanistan	and	liberia	.
and	over	there	i	 experience 	 d 	 	other	people	's	 suffer 	 ing 	 	,	up	close	and	personal	,	 immers 	 ed 	 	 my 	 self 	 	in	some	 ra 	 ther 	 	 intens 	 e 	 	and	 emotion 	 al 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	,	and	at	 time 	 s 	 	i	 experience 	 d 	 	great	fear	for	my	own	life	.
 a 	 s 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	,	i	would	return	to	bangalore	,	and	often	to	 animate 	 d 	 	 discuss 	 ions 	 	at	friend	's	 home 	 s 	 	,	where	we	would	discuss	 vari 	 ous 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	while	they	 complain 	 ed 	 	 bitter 	 ly 	 	about	the	new	pub	 tim 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	where	a	drink	often	cost	more	than	what	they	'd	paid	 the 	 ir 	 	14	-	year	-	old	maid	.
i	would	feel	 ver 	 y 	 	 isolate 	 d 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	these	 discuss 	 ions 	 	.
but	at	the	same	time	,	i	 question 	 ed 	 	 my 	 self 	 	and	my	own	 integ 	 r 	 ity 	 	and	purpose	in	 story 	 tell 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	 decide 	 d 	 	that	i	had	 com 	 promise 	 d 	 	,	just	like	my	 friend 	 s 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 discuss 	 ions 	 	,	where	we	told	 st 	 ories 	 	in	 con 	 text 	 s 	 	we	made	 excuse 	 s 	 	for	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	taking	 respons 	 ibility 	 	for	.
i	wo	n't	go	 in 	 to 	 	 detail 	 s 	 	about	what	led	to	a	decision	i	made	,	but	let	's	just	say	it	 involve 	 d 	 	alcohol	,	 cigar 	 ette 	 s 	 	,	other	 sub 	 stance 	 s 	 	and	a	woman	.
i	 bas 	 ically 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	that	it	was	i	,	not	the	camera	or	the	network	,	or	 any 	 thing 	 	that	lay	 out 	 side 	 	 my 	 self 	 	,	that	was	the	 on 	 ly 	 	instrument	in	 story 	 tell 	 ing 	 	 tru 	 ly 	 	worth	 t 	 un 	 ing 	 	.
in	my	life	,	when	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	success	or	 re 	 cognition 	 	,	they	 elude 	 d 	 	me	.
 paradox 	 ically 	 	,	when	i	let	go	of	these	 object 	 ive 	 s 	 	,	and	 work 	 ed 	 	from	a	place	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	and	purpose	,	looking	for	excellence	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	the	 result 	 s 	 	of	it	,	 every 	 thing 	 	 arriv 	 ed 	 	on	 it 	 s 	 	own	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 fulfill 	 ment 	 	.
 photograph 	 y 	 	 transcend 	 ed 	 	culture	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	my	own	.
and	it	is	,	for	me	,	a	language	which	 express 	 ed 	 	the	 in 	 tangible 	 	,	and	 give 	 s 	 	voice	to	people	and	 st 	 ories 	 	 with 	 out 	 	.
i	 invit 	 e 	 	you	 in 	 to 	 	three	 re 	 cent 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	of	mine	,	which	are	about	 th 	 is 	 	way	of	looking	,	if	you	will	,	which	i	 believ 	 e 	 	 exempl 	 ify 	 	the	 ten 	 et 	 s 	 	of	what	i	like	to	call	 compass 	 ion 	 	in	 story 	 tell 	 ing 	 	.
in	2007	i	went	to	liberia	,	where	a	group	of	my	 friend 	 s 	 	and	i	did	an	 in 	 dependent 	 	,	self	-	funded	film	,	still	in	progress	,	on	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 legend 	 ary 	 	and	brutal	war	-	lord	named	general	butt	naked	.
his	real	name	is	joshua	,	and	he	's	 picture 	 d 	 	here	in	a	cell	where	he	once	used	to	torture	and	murder	people	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	children	.
joshua	 claim 	 s 	 	to	have	 personal 	 ly 	 	 kill 	 ed 	 	more	than	10,000	people	 dur 	 ing 	 	liberia	's	civil	war	.
he	got	his	name	from	 fight 	 ing 	 	 star 	 k 	 	naked	.
and	he	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	most	 pro 	 l 	 ific 	 	mass	 murder 	 er 	 	 al 	 ive 	 	on	earth	 to 	 day 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	woman	 witness 	 ed 	 	the	general	 murder 	 ing 	 	her	brother	.
joshua	 command 	 ed 	 	his	child	-	 soldier 	 s 	 	to	commit	 un 	 speak 	 able 	 	 crime 	 s 	 	,	and	 enforce 	 d 	 	his	command	with	great	 brutal 	 ity 	 	.
 to 	 day 	 	 man 	 y 	 	of	these	children	are	 addict 	 ed 	 	to	 drug 	 s 	 	like	 hero 	 in 	 	,	and	they	are	destitute	,	like	these	young	men	in	the	image	.
how	do	you	live	with	 your 	 self 	 	if	you	know	you	've	 commit 	 ted 	 	 horr 	 ific 	 	 crime 	 s 	 	?
 to 	 day 	 	the	general	is	a	 b 	 apt 	 ized 	 	christian	 evangel 	 ist 	 	.
and	he	's	on	a	mission	.
we	 accompani 	 ed 	 	joshua	,	 a 	 s 	 	he	 walk 	 ed 	 	the	earth	,	 visit 	 ing 	 	 village 	 s 	 	where	he	had	once	 kill 	 ed 	 	and	 rap 	 ed 	 	.
he	 seek 	 ed 	 	 forgive 	 ness 	 	,	and	he	 claim 	 s 	 	to	endeavor	to	improve	the	 live 	 s 	 	of	his	child	-	 soldier 	 s 	 	.
 dur 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 	i	 expect 	 ed 	 	him	to	be	 kill 	 ed 	 	 out 	 right 	 	,	and	us	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
but	what	i	saw	 open 	 ed 	 	my	 eye 	 s 	 	to	an	idea	of	 forgive 	 ness 	 	which	i	never	thought	possible	.
in	the	 mid 	 st 	 	of	 in 	 credible 	 	poverty	and	loss	,	people	who	had	 noth 	 ing 	 	 ab 	 solve 	 d 	 	a	man	who	had	taken	 every 	 thing 	 	from	them	.
he	 beg 	 s 	 	for	 forgive 	 ness 	 	,	and	 receiv 	 es 	 	it	from	the	same	woman	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	brother	he	 murder 	 ed 	 	.
senegalese	,	the	young	man	 seat 	 ed 	 	on	the	wheelchair	here	,	was	once	a	child	soldier	,	under	the	general	's	command	,	 un 	 til 	 	he	 dis 	 obey 	 ed 	 	 order 	 s 	 	,	and	the	general	shot	off	both	his	 leg 	 s 	 	.
he	 forgive 	 s 	 	the	general	in	 th 	 is 	 	image	.
he	 risk 	 ed 	 	his	life	 a 	 s 	 	he	 walk 	 ed 	 	up	to	people	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	he	'd	 murder 	 ed 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	photograph	a	 hostil 	 e 	 	crowd	in	a	 s 	 lum 	 	 surround 	 s 	 	him	.
and	joshua	 remain 	 s 	 	silent	 a 	 s 	 	they	 vent 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	rage	against	him	.
 th 	 is 	 	image	,	to	me	,	is	 al 	 most 	 	like	from	a	shakespearean	play	,	with	a	man	,	 surround 	 ed 	 	by	 vari 	 ous 	 	 influence 	 s 	 	,	desperate	to	hold	on	to	 some 	 thing 	 	true	 with 	 in 	 	 him 	 self 	 	,	in	a	 con 	 text 	 	of	great	 suffer 	 ing 	 	that	he	 ha 	 s 	 	 create 	 d 	 	 him 	 self 	 	.
i	was	 intens 	 e 	 ly 	 	 move 	 d 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	.
but	the	question	is	,	 do 	 es 	 	 forgive 	 ness 	 	and	 re 	 de 	 mption 	 	replace	justice	?
joshua	,	in	his	own	 word 	 s 	 	,	 say 	 s 	 	that	he	 do 	 es 	 	not	mind	 stand 	 ing 	 	trial	for	his	 crime 	 s 	 	,	and	 speak 	 s 	 	about	them	from	 soap 	 boxes 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	monrovia	,	to	an	audience	that	often	 include 	 s 	 	his	 victim 	 s 	 	.
a	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 like 	 ly 	 	 spoke 	 s 	 person 	 	for	the	idea	of	 separat 	 ion 	 	of	church	and	state	.
the	second	story	i	'm	going	to	tell	you	about	is	about	a	group	of	 ver 	 y 	 	special	 fight 	 ing 	 	women	with	 ra 	 ther 	 	 un 	 ique 	 	peace	-	 keep 	 ing 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	.
liberia	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 deva 	 state 	 d 	 	by	one	of	africa	's	 blood 	 iest 	 	civil	 war 	 s 	 	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	left	more	than	200,000	people	dead	,	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	women	 scar 	 red 	 	by	rape	and	crime	on	a	spectacular	scale	.
liberia	is	now	home	to	an	all	-	woman	 unit 	 ed 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	 con 	 ting 	 ent 	 	of	indian	 peace 	 keeper 	 s 	 	.
these	women	,	 man 	 y 	 	from	small	 town 	 s 	 	in	india	,	help	keep	the	peace	,	far	away	from	home	and	family	.
they	use	 negoti 	 ation 	 	and	 toler 	 ance 	 	more	often	than	an	 arm 	 ed 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	.
the	 command 	 er 	 	told	me	that	a	woman	could	gauge	a	 potential 	 ly 	 	violent	 situ 	 ation 	 	much	better	than	men	.
and	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	 definite 	 ly 	 	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 d 	 if 	 fusing 	 	it	non	-	 aggress 	 ively 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	man	was	 ver 	 y 	 	drunk	,	and	he	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	my	camera	,	 un 	 til 	 	he	 notice 	 d 	 	the	women	,	who	 handle 	 d 	 	him	with	 s 	 mile 	 s 	 	,	and	ak	-	47s	at	the	ready	,	of	course	.
 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 ting 	 ent 	 	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	 quit 	 e 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	,	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 sustain 	 ed 	 	any	 casual 	 ties 	 	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	 dozen 	 s 	 	of	 peace 	 keeper 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 kill 	 ed 	 	in	liberia	.
and	 y 	 es 	 	,	all	of	 t 	 hose 	 	people	 kill 	 ed 	 	 we 	 re 	 	male	.
 man 	 y 	 	of	the	women	are	married	with	children	,	and	they	say	the	 hard 	 est 	 	part	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 deploy 	 ment 	 	was	 be 	 ing 	 	 ke 	 pt 	 	away	from	 the 	 ir 	 	children	.
i	 accompani 	 ed 	 	these	women	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 patrol 	 s 	 	,	and	 watch 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	 walk 	 ed 	 	past	men	,	 man 	 y 	 	who	 pass 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	lewd	 comment 	 s 	 	 incessant 	 ly 	 	.
and	when	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	one	of	the	women	about	the	shock	and	awe	 respons 	 e 	 	,	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	do	n't	worry	,	same	thing	back	home	.
we	know	how	to	deal	with	these	 fellow 	 s 	 	,	``	and	 ignor 	 ed 	 	them	.
in	a	country	 ravage 	 d 	 	by	violence	against	women	,	indian	 peace 	 keeper 	 s 	 	have	inspired	 man 	 y 	 	local	women	to	join	the	police	force	.
 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	when	the	war	is	over	and	all	the	film	 crew 	 s 	 	have	left	,	the	most	inspiring	 st 	 ories 	 	are	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	float	just	 be 	 neath 	 	the	radar	.
i	came	back	to	india	and	 no 	 body 	 	was	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 buy 	 ing 	 	the	story	.
and	one	editor	told	me	that	she	was	n't	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 do 	 ing 	 	what	she	 call 	 ed 	 	``	manual	labor	 st 	 ories 	 	.	``
in	2007	and	2009	i	did	 st 	 ories 	 	on	the	delhi	fire	service	,	the	dfs	,	which	,	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	summer	,	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	world	's	most	active	fire	 depart 	 ment 	 	.
they	answer	more	than	5,000	 call 	 s 	 	in	just	two	 month 	 s 	 	.
and	all	 th 	 is 	 	against	 in 	 credible 	 	 logist 	 ical 	 	 odd 	 s 	 	,	like	heat	and	traffic	 jam 	 s 	 	.
 some 	 thing 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	shoot	.
due	to	a	traffic	jam	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	late	in	 get 	 ting 	 	to	a	 s 	 lum 	 	,	a	large	 s 	 lum 	 	,	which	had	caught	fire	.
 a 	 s 	 	we	 near 	 ed 	 	,	 ang 	 ry 	 	 crowd 	 s 	 	 attack 	 ed 	 	our	 truck 	 s 	 	and	 stone 	 d 	 	them	,	by	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	people	all	over	the	place	.
these	men	 we 	 re 	 	 terr 	 ified 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	mob	 attack 	 ed 	 	our	vehicle	.
but	 non 	 e 	 the 	 less 	 	,	 de 	 spite 	 	the	 hostil 	 ity 	 	,	 fire 	 fight 	 ers 	 	left	the	vehicle	and	 success 	 fully 	 	 f 	 ought 	 	the	fire	.

some	of	the	local	people	 for 	 c 	 ibly 	 	took	away	the	 hose 	 s 	 	from	the	 fire 	 men 	 	to	put	out	the	fire	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 home 	 s 	 	.
now	,	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 home 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 destroy 	 ed 	 	.
but	the	question	that	 linger 	 ed 	 	in	my	mind	was	,	what	 cause 	 s 	 	people	to	destroy	fire	 truck 	 s 	 	headed	to	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 home 	 s 	 	?
where	 do 	 es 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	rage	come	from	?
and	how	are	we	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	?
45	percent	of	the	14	million	people	who	live	in	delhi	live	in	 un 	 author 	 ized 	 	 s 	 lum 	 s 	 	,	which	are	 chronic 	 ally 	 	 over 	 crowd 	 ed 	 	.
they	lack	even	the	most	 bas 	 ic 	 	 a 	 men 	 ities 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	common	to	all	our	big	cities	.
back	to	the	dfs	.	a	huge	chemical	 de 	 pot 	 	caught	fire	,	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 drum 	 s 	 	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	 petro 	 chemical 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 blaz 	 ing 	 	away	and	 expl 	 o 	 d 	 ing 	 	all	around	us	.
the	heat	was	so	 intens 	 e 	 	,	that	 hose 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	used	to	cool	down	 fire 	 fight 	 ers 	 	 fight 	 ing 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	close	to	the	fire	,	and	with	no	 protect 	 ive 	 	 cloth 	 ing 	 	.
in	india	we	often	love	to	complain	about	our	government	bodies	.
but	over	here	,	the	 head 	 s 	 	of	the	dfs	,	mr.	r.c	.	sharman	,	mr.	a.k	.	sharman	,	led	the	 fire 	 fight 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	men	.
 some 	 thing 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	in	a	country	where	manual	labor	is	often	 look 	 ed 	 	down	 up 	 on 	 	.
over	the	 year 	 s 	 	,	my	faith	in	the	power	of	 story 	 tell 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	tested	.
and	i	've	had	 ver 	 y 	 	serious	doubt	about	 it 	 s 	 	 e 	 ff 	 ic 	 acy 	 	,	and	my	own	faith	in	 human 	 ity 	 	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	a	film	we	shot	still	 air 	 s 	 	on	the	national	 geo 	 graphic 	 	channel	.
and	when	it	 air 	 s 	 	i	get	 call 	 s 	 	from	all	the	 guy 	 s 	 	i	was	with	and	they	tell	me	that	they	 receiv 	 e 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 call 	 s 	 	 congratula 	 ting 	 	them	.
some	of	the	 fire 	 men 	 	told	me	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 so 	 	inspired	to	do	better	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	so	 pleas 	 ed 	 	to	get	thank	-	yous	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	brick	 bat 	 s 	 	.
it	 seem 	 s 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	story	 help 	 ed 	 	change	 per 	 ception 	 s 	 	about	the	dfs	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	in	the	 mind 	 s 	 	of	an	audience	in	part	on	 tele 	 vision 	 s 	 	,	read	 magazine 	 s 	 	and	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 hut 	 s 	 	are	n't	on	fire	.
