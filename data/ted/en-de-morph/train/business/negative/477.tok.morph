it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	a	couple	dozen	square	 mile 	 s 	 	.	it	's	in	the	rockies	.

my	role	on	the	show	,	for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	have	n't	 s 	 een 	 	it	--	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	simple	.
i	'm	an	apprentice	,	and	i	work	with	the	people	who	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	the	 job 	 s 	 	in	question	.
and	my	 respons 	 ibilities 	 	are	to	 simpl 	 y 	 	try	and	keep	up	and	give	an	honest	account	of	what	it	's	like	to	be	these	people	,	for	one	day	in	 the 	 ir 	 	life	.
the	job	in	question	:	 herd 	 ing 	 	sheep	.	great	.
we	go	to	craig	and	we	check	in	to	a	hotel	and	i	 real 	 ize 	 	the	next	day	that	 cast 	 ration 	 	is	going	to	be	an	absolute	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	work	.
so	,	 normal 	 ly 	 	,	i	never	do	any	research	at	all	.
but	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 touch 	 y 	 	subject	,	and	i	work	for	the	 discover 	 y 	 	channel	,	and	we	want	to	 port 	 ray 	 	 accurate 	 ly 	 	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	we	do	,	and	we	 certain 	 ly 	 	want	to	do	it	with	a	lot	of	respect	for	the	 animal 	 s 	 	.
so	i	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 human 	 e 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	and	i	say	,	``	look	,	i	'm	going	to	be	 cast 	 rating 	 	some	 lamb 	 s 	 	,	can	you	tell	me	the	deal	?	``
and	they	're	like	,	``	 yea 	 h 	 	,	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	 straight 	 forward 	 	.	``
they	use	a	band	--	 bas 	 ically 	 	a	rubber	band	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	 on 	 ly 	 	a	little	 small 	 er 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	one	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	around	the	 play 	 ing 	 	 card 	 s 	 	i	got	 yester 	 day 	 	,	but	it	had	a	certain	 familiar 	 ity 	 	to	it	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	what	 exact 	 ly 	 	is	the	process	?	``
and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	the	band	is	 appli 	 ed 	 	to	the	tail	,	 tight 	 ly 	 	.
and	then	 an 	 other 	 	band	is	 appli 	 ed 	 	to	the	scrotum	,	 tight 	 ly 	 	.

``	great	--	got	it	.	``
ok	,	i	call	the	spca	to	confirm	 th 	 is 	 	--	they	confirm	it	.
i	 al 	 so 	 	call	peta	,	just	for	 f 	 un 	 	,	and	they	do	n't	like	it	--	but	they	confirm	it	.
ok	,	that	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	how	you	do	it	.
so	the	next	day	i	go	out	.
and	i	'm	 give 	 n 	 	a	horse	and	we	go	get	the	 lamb 	 s 	 	and	we	take	them	to	a	pen	that	we	built	,	and	we	go	about	the	business	of	animal	 husband 	 ry 	 	.
melanie	is	the	wife	of	albert	.
albert	is	the	shepherd	in	question	.
melanie	 pick 	 s 	 	up	the	lamb	--	two	 hand 	 s 	 	--	one	hand	on	both	 leg 	 s 	 	on	the	right	,	 like 	 wise 	 	on	the	left	.

i	 al 	 ways 	 	watch	the	process	 d 	 one 	 	the	first	time	before	i	try	it	.
 be 	 ing 	 	an	apprentice	,	you	know	,	you	do	that	.
albert	 reach 	 es 	 	in	his	pocket	to	pull	out	,	you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	black	rubber	band	but	what	 come 	 s 	 	out	 in 	 stead 	 	is	a	knife	.
and	i	'm	like	that	's	not	rubber	at	all	,	you	know	.
and	he	kind	of	 flick 	 ed 	 	it	open	in	a	way	that	caught	the	 s 	 un 	 	that	was	just	coming	over	the	rockies	,	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	--	it	was	,	it	was	 impress 	 ive 	 	.
in	the	space	of	about	two	 second 	 s 	 	,	albert	had	the	knife	between	the	 cart 	 il 	 age 	 	of	the	tail	,	right	next	to	the	butt	of	the	lamb	,	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	the	tail	was	gone	and	in	the	 buck 	 et 	 	that	i	was	 hold 	 ing 	 	.
a	second	 lat 	 er 	 	,	with	a	big	thumb	and	a	well	 call 	 ous 	 ed 	 	 fore 	 finger 	 	,	he	had	the	scrotum	 firm 	 ly 	 	in	his	grasp	.
and	he	 pull 	 ed 	 	it	 to 	 ward 	 	him	,	like	so	,	and	he	took	the	knife	and	he	put	it	on	the	tip	.
now	you	think	you	know	what	's	coming	,	michael	--	you	do	n't	,	ok	?
he	 snip 	 s 	 	it	,	 throw 	 s 	 	the	tip	over	his	shoulder	,	and	then	 grab 	 s 	 	the	scrotum	and	 push 	 es 	 	it	 up 	 ward 	 	,	and	then	his	head	 dip 	 s 	 	down	,	 obscur 	 ing 	 	my	view	,	but	what	i	hear	is	a	 slurp 	 ing 	 	sound	,	and	a	noise	that	 sound 	 s 	 	like	velcro	 be 	 ing 	 	 yank 	 ed 	 	off	a	 stick 	 y 	 	wall	and	i	am	not	even	 kid 	 d 	 ing 	 	.
can	we	roll	the	video	?
no	i	'm	 kid 	 d 	 ing 	 	--	we	do	n't	--	i	thought	it	best	to	talk	in	 picture 	 s 	 	.
so	,	i	do	 some 	 thing 	 	now	i	've	never	ever	 d 	 one 	 	on	a	``	 dirt 	 y 	 	 job 	 s 	 	``	shoot	,	ever	.

you	 guy 	 s 	 	know	the	show	,	we	use	take	one	,	we	do	n't	do	take	two	.
there	's	no	writing	,	there	's	no	 script 	 ing 	 	,	there	's	no	 non 	 sense 	 	.
we	do	n't	fool	around	,	we	do	n't	 rehears 	 e 	 	--	we	shoot	what	we	get	!
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	stop	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	nuts	.	``
i	mean	,	you	know	.
``	 th 	 is 	 	is	crazy	.

and	albert	's	like	,	``	what	?	``
and	i	'm	like	,	``	i	do	n't	know	what	just	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	but	there	are	 test 	 icles 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 buck 	 et 	 	and	that	's	not	how	we	do	it	.	``
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	``	well	,	that	's	how	we	do	it	.	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	why	would	you	do	it	 th 	 is 	 	way	?	``
and	before	i	even	let	him	explain	,	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	want	to	do	it	the	right	way	,	with	the	rubber	 band 	 s 	 	.	``

he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	ok	.	``
he	 go 	 es 	 	to	his	box	and	he	 pull 	 s 	 	out	a	bag	of	these	little	rubber	 band 	 s 	 	.
melanie	 pick 	 s 	 	up	 an 	 other 	 	lamb	,	 put 	 s 	 	it	on	the	post	,	band	 go 	 es 	 	on	the	tail	,	band	 go 	 es 	 	on	the	scrotum	.

i	'm	like	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	good	sign	for	 th 	 is 	 	lamb	,	at	all	.

 mean 	 while 	 	,	the	lamb	that	he	had	just	did	his	little	procedure	on	is	,	you	know	,	he	's	just	 pr 	 anc 	 ing 	 	around	,	 ble 	 ed 	 ing 	 	 stop 	 ped 	 	.
he	's	,	you	know	,	 ni 	 b 	 bling 	 	on	some	grass	,	 fro 	 lick 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	was	just	so	blown	away	at	how	wrong	i	was	,	in	that	second	.

melanie	 pick 	 s 	 	up	the	lamb	,	 put 	 s 	 	it	on	the	post	,	 open 	 s 	 	it	up	.

albert	 instruct 	 s 	 	,	``	push	it	way	up	there	.	``

``	push	it	further	.	``

the	 test 	 icles 	 	emerge	--	they	look	like	 thumb 	 s 	 	,	coming	right	at	you	--	and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	bite	'	em	.
just	bite	'	em	off	.	``
and	i	heard	him	,	i	heard	all	the	 word 	 s 	 	.

how	did	--	you	know	--	i	mean	--	how	did	i	get	here	?
it	's	just	--	it	's	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 moment 	 s 	 	where	the	brain	 go 	 es 	 	off	on	it	's	own	:	and	 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	i	'm	 stand 	 ing 	 	there	,	in	the	rockies	,	and	all	i	can	think	of	is	the	aristotelian	definition	of	a	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	.
you	know	,	aristotle	 say 	 s 	 	a	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	is	that	moment	when	the	hero	 come 	 s 	 	face	to	face	with	his	true	 ident 	 ity 	 	.
and	i	'm	like	,	``	what	is	 th 	 is 	 	jacked	-	up	metaphor	?
i	do	n't	like	what	i	'm	 think 	 ing 	 	right	now	.	``
and	i	ca	n't	get	 th 	 is 	 	thought	out	of	my	head	,	and	i	ca	n't	get	that	vision	out	of	my	sight	,	so	i	did	what	i	had	to	do	.
i	went	in	and	i	took	them	.
i	took	them	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	i	 yank 	 ed 	 	my	face	back	.
and	i	'm	 stand 	 ing 	 	there	with	two	 test 	 icles 	 	on	my	chin	.
and	now	i	ca	n't	get	--	i	ca	n't	shake	the	metaphor	.
ok	,	i	'm	still	in	``	 poet 	 ic 	 s 	 	,	``	in	aristotle	,	and	i	'm	 think 	 ing 	 	--	out	of	 no 	 where 	 	,	two	 term 	 s 	 	come	 crash 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	my	head	that	i	have	n't	heard	since	my	 classic 	 s 	 	professor	in	college	 drill 	 ed 	 	them	there	.
and	they	are	 ana 	 gnorisis 	 	and	 peri 	 peteia 	 	.
 ana 	 gnorisis 	 	and	 peri 	 peteia 	 	.
 ana 	 gnorisis 	 	is	the	greek	word	for	 discover 	 y 	 	.

and	i	'm	up	to	my	neck	in	 anagno 	 rise 	 s 	 	every	single	day	.

the	other	word	,	 peri 	 peteia 	 	,	that	's	the	moment	in	the	great	 tra 	 ged 	 ies 	 	,	you	know	--	euripides	and	sophocles	--	the	moment	where	oedipus	 ha 	 s 	 	his	moment	,	where	he	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 real 	 ize 	 s 	 	that	hot	chick	he	's	 be 	 en 	 	 sleep 	 ing 	 	with	and	 hav 	 ing 	 	 bab 	 ies 	 	with	is	his	mother	.	ok	.
that	's	 peri 	 pet 	 y 	 	or	 peri 	 peteia 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	metaphor	in	my	head	--	i	got	 ana 	 gnorisis 	 	and	 peri 	 pet 	 ia 	 	on	my	chin	.
i	got	to	tell	you	,	it	's	 s 	 uch 	 	a	great	 de 	 vice 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	.

and	he	'd	laugh	at	you	.
the	guy	's	worth	--	he	just	got	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	like	60	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	for	his	farm	and	 turn 	 ed 	 	it	down	,	 out 	 side 	 	of	vegas	.
he	did	n't	follow	his	 pass 	 ion 	 	.
he	 steppe 	 d 	 	back	and	he	 watch 	 ed 	 	where	 every 	 body 	 	was	going	and	he	went	the	other	way	.
and	i	hear	that	story	over	and	over	.
matt	froind	,	a	 dai 	 ry 	 	 farm 	 er 	 	in	new	canaan	,	connecticut	,	who	 wok 	 e 	 	up	one	day	and	 real 	 ized 	 	the	crap	from	his	 cow 	 s 	 	was	worth	more	than	 the 	 ir 	 	milk	,	if	he	could	use	it	to	make	these	 bio 	 degradable 	 	flower	 pot 	 s 	 	.
now	,	he	's	selling	them	to	walmart	.
follow	his	 pass 	 ion 	 	?	the	guy	's	--	come	on	.
so	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	look	at	 pass 	 ion 	 	,	i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	look	at	efficiency	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	 effective 	 ness 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	tim	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	 ear 	 lier 	 	,	that	's	a	huge	 distinct 	 ion 	 	.
i	 start 	 ed 	 	to	look	at	 team 	 work 	 	and	 determi 	 nation 	 	,	and	 bas 	 ically 	 	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 p 	 latitude 	 s 	 	they	call	``	 success 	 ories 	 	``	that	hang	with	that	 schmaltz 	 y 	 	art	in	 board 	 rooms 	 	around	the	world	right	now	.
that	stuff	--	it	's	 sudden 	 ly 	 	all	 be 	 en 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	on	 it 	 s 	 	head	.
 safe 	 ty 	 	--	 safe 	 ty 	 	first	?
going	back	to	,	you	know	,	osha	and	peta	and	the	 human 	 e 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	:	what	if	osha	got	it	wrong	?
i	mean	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	 here 	 s 	 y 	 	,	what	i	'm	about	to	say	--	but	what	if	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 safe 	 ty 	 	third	?
right	?
no	,	i	mean	 re 	 ally 	 	.
what	i	mean	to	say	is	i	value	my	 safe 	 ty 	 	on	these	crazy	 job 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	the	people	that	i	'm	 work 	 ing 	 	with	,	but	the	 one 	 s 	 	who	 re 	 ally 	 	get	it	 d 	 one 	 	,	they	're	not	out	there	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 safe 	 ty 	 	first	.
they	know	that	other	 thing 	 s 	 	come	first	--	the	business	of	 do 	 ing 	 	the	work	 come 	 s 	 	first	,	the	business	of	 get 	 ting 	 	it	 d 	 one 	 	.
and	i	'll	never	forget	,	up	in	the	bering	sea	,	i	was	on	a	crab	boat	with	the	``	 dead 	 liest 	 	catch	``	 guy 	 s 	 	--	which	i	 al 	 so 	 	work	on	--	in	the	first	season	.
we	're	about	100	 mile 	 s 	 	off	the	coast	of	russia	:	50	-	foot	 sea 	 s 	 	,	big	 wave 	 s 	 	,	green	water	coming	over	the	 wheel 	 house 	 	,	right	?
most	 hazard 	 ous 	 	environment	i	'd	ever	 s 	 een 	 	,	and	i	was	back	with	a	guy	,	 lash 	 ing 	 	the	 pot 	 s 	 	down	.
so	,	i	'm	40	feet	off	the	deck	,	which	is	like	looking	down	at	the	top	of	your	shoe	,	you	know	,	and	it	's	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	ocean	.
unspeakably	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
i	 s 	 camp 	 er 	 	down	,	i	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	 wheel 	 house 	 	and	i	say	,	with	some	level	of	 in 	 credulity 	 	,	``	 cap 	 tain 	 	,	osha	.	``
and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	osha	?	ocean	.	``
and	he	 point 	 s 	 	out	there	.
but	in	that	moment	,	what	he	 s 	 aid 	 	next	ca	n't	be	 repeat 	 ed 	 	in	the	lower	48	.
it	ca	n't	be	 repeat 	 ed 	 	on	any	 factor 	 y 	 	floor	or	any	construction	 s 	 ite 	 	.
but	he	 look 	 ed 	 	at	me	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	son	``	--	he	's	my	age	,	by	the	way	,	he	 call 	 s 	 	me	son	,	i	love	that	--	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	son	,	i	'm	a	 cap 	 tain 	 	of	a	crab	boat	.
my	 respons 	 ibility 	 	is	not	to	get	you	home	 al 	 ive 	 	.
my	 respons 	 ibility 	 	is	to	get	you	home	rich	.	``
you	want	to	get	home	 al 	 ive 	 	,	that	's	on	you	.
and	for	the	rest	of	that	day	,	 safe 	 ty 	 	first	.
i	was	like	--	so	,	the	idea	that	we	create	 th 	 is 	 	false	--	 th 	 is 	 	sense	of	 com 	 place 	 ncy 	 	when	all	we	do	is	talk	about	 some 	 body 	 	else	's	 respons 	 ibility 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	it	's	our	own	,	and	vice	versa	.
 any 	 how 	 	,	a	whole	lot	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
i	could	talk	at	length	about	the	 man 	 y 	 	little	 distinct 	 ions 	 	we	made	and	the	 end 	 less 	 	list	of	ways	that	i	got	it	wrong	.
but	,	what	it	all	 come 	 s 	 	down	to	is	 th 	 is 	 	.
i	 form 	 ed 	 	a	 theor 	 y 	 	,	and	i	'm	going	to	share	it	now	in	my	 remain 	 ing 	 	two	 minute 	 s 	 	and	30	 second 	 s 	 	.
it	 go 	 es 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	--	we	've	 declare 	 d 	 	war	on	work	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	all	of	us	.
it	's	a	civil	war	.
it	's	a	cold	war	,	 re 	 ally 	 	.
we	did	n't	set	out	to	do	it	and	we	did	n't	twist	our	 must 	 ache 	 	in	some	machiavellian	way	,	but	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	it	.
and	we	've	 wage 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	war	on	at	 l 	 east 	 	four	 front 	 s 	 	,	 certain 	 ly 	 	in	hollywood	.
the	way	we	 port 	 ray 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	people	on	tv	--	it	's	 laugh 	 able 	 	.
if	there	's	a	 plumb 	 er 	 	,	he	's	300	 pound 	 s 	 	and	he	's	got	a	giant	butt	crack	.	admit	it	.
you	see	him	all	the	time	.
that	's	what	 plumb 	 ers 	 	look	like	,	right	?
we	turn	them	 in 	 to 	 	heroes	,	or	we	turn	them	 in 	 to 	 	punch	lines	.
that	's	what	tv	 do 	 es 	 	.
we	try	hard	on	``	 dirt 	 y 	 	 job 	 s 	 	``	not	to	do	that	,	which	is	why	i	do	the	work	and	i	do	n't	cheat	.
but	,	we	've	 wage 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	war	on	madison	 a 	 venue 	 	.
i	mean	,	so	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 commercial 	 s 	 	that	come	out	there	--	in	the	way	of	a	 mess 	 age 	 	,	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	?
your	life	would	be	better	if	you	could	work	a	little	less	,	if	you	did	n't	have	to	work	so	hard	,	if	you	could	get	home	a	little	 ear 	 lier 	 	,	if	you	could	retire	a	little	 fast 	 er 	 	,	if	you	could	punch	out	a	little	 soon 	 er 	 	--	it	's	all	in	there	,	over	and	over	,	 aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	.
washington	?	i	ca	n't	even	begin	to	talk	about	the	 deal 	 s 	 	and	 poli 	 cies 	 	in	place	that	affect	the	bottom	line	 re 	 ality 	 	of	the	 avail 	 able 	 	 job 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	i	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	know	.
i	just	know	that	that	's	a	front	in	 th 	 is 	 	war	.
and	right	here	 guy 	 s 	 	,	silicon	 val 	 ley 	 	,	i	mean	--	how	 man 	 y 	 	people	have	an	iphone	on	them	right	now	?
how	 man 	 y 	 	people	have	 the 	 ir 	 	blackberries	?
we	're	 plug 	 ged 	 	in	;	we	're	 connect 	 ed 	 	.
i	would	never	suggest	for	a	second	that	 some 	 thing 	 	bad	 ha 	 s 	 	come	out	of	the	tech	revolution	.
good	grief	,	not	to	 th 	 is 	 	crowd	.
but	i	would	suggest	that	 innov 	 ation 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 imit 	 ation 	 	is	a	complete	waste	of	time	.
and	 no 	 body 	 	 celebr 	 ates 	 	 imit 	 ation 	 	the	way	``	 dirt 	 y 	 	 job 	 s 	 	``	 guy 	 s 	 	know	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 d 	 one 	 	.
your	iphone	 with 	 out 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	people	making	the	same	 inter 	 face 	 	,	the	same	 circuit 	 ry 	 	,	the	same	board	,	over	and	over	?
all	of	that	?	that	's	what	 make 	 s 	 	it	 equal 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	possible	 a 	 s 	 	the	 gen 	 ius 	 	that	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 side 	 	of	it	.
so	,	we	've	got	 th 	 is 	 	new	 tool 	 box 	 	,	you	know	.
our	 tool 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	do	n't	look	like	 shove 	 l 	 s 	 	and	 pick 	 s 	 	.
they	look	like	the	stuff	we	walk	around	with	.
and	so	the	 collect 	 ive 	 	effect	of	all	of	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 marginal 	 ization 	 	of	 lot 	 s 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 job 	 s 	 	.
and	i	 real 	 ized 	 	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	too	late	in	 th 	 is 	 	game	--	i	hope	not	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	do	n't	know	if	i	can	do	200	more	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	--	but	we	're	going	to	do	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	can	.
and	to	me	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	to	know	and	to	 re 	 ally 	 	come	face	to	face	with	,	is	that	fact	that	i	got	it	wrong	about	a	lot	of	 thing 	 s 	 	,	not	just	the	 test 	 icles 	 	on	my	chin	.
i	got	a	lot	wrong	.
so	,	we	're	 think 	 ing 	 	--	by	we	,	i	mean	me	--	that	the	thing	to	do	is	to	talk	about	a	pr	campaign	for	work	,	manual	labor	,	 skill 	 ed 	 	labor	.
 some 	 body 	 	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	out	there	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	 for 	 gotten 	 	 benefit 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 grand 	 father 	 	stuff	,	the	stuff	a	lot	us	 prob 	 ably 	 	grew	up	with	but	we	've	kind	of	--	you	know	,	kind	of	lost	a	little	.
barack	 want 	 s 	 	to	create	two	and	a	half	million	 job 	 s 	 	.
the	 infra 	 structure 	 	is	a	huge	deal	.
 th 	 is 	 	war	on	work	,	that	i	suppose	 exist 	 s 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 casual 	 ties 	 	like	any	other	war	.
the	 infra 	 structure 	 	's	the	first	one	;	 dec 	 lining 	 	trade	-	school	 enroll 	 ments 	 	are	the	second	one	.
every	single	year	:	 few 	 er 	 	 electric 	 ians 	 	,	 few 	 er 	 	 carp 	 enter 	 s 	 	,	 few 	 er 	 	 plumb 	 ers 	 	,	 few 	 er 	 	 weld 	 ers 	 	,	 few 	 er 	 	 pipe 	 fit 	 ter 	 s 	 	,	 few 	 er 	 	steamfitters	.
the	 infra 	 structure 	 	 job 	 s 	 	that	 every 	 body 	 	is	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	creating	are	 t 	 hose 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	--	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	in	decline	,	over	and	over	.
 mean 	 while 	 	,	we	've	got	two	trillion	 dollar 	 s 	 	--	at	a	 minim 	 um 	 	,	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	the	american	 socie 	 ty 	 	of	civil	 engineer 	 s 	 	--	that	we	need	to	expend	to	even	make	a	dent	in	the	 infra 	 structure 	 	,	which	is	 current 	 ly 	 	rated	at	a	d	minus	.
so	,	if	i	 we 	 re 	 	running	for	 any 	 thing 	 	,	and	i	'm	not	,	i	would	 simpl 	 y 	 	say	that	the	 job 	 s 	 	we	hope	to	make	and	the	 job 	 s 	 	we	hope	to	create	are	n't	going	to	stick	 un 	 less 	 	they	're	 job 	 s 	 	that	people	want	.
and	i	know	the	point	of	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	is	to	 celebr 	 ate 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	near	and	dear	to	us	,	but	i	 al 	 so 	 	know	that	clean	and	 dirt 	 y 	 	are	n't	 oppos 	 ites 	 	.
they	're	two	 side 	 s 	 	of	the	same	 co 	 in 	 	,	just	like	 innov 	 ation 	 	and	 imit 	 ation 	 	,	like	risk	and	 respons 	 ibility 	 	,	like	 peri 	 pet 	 ia 	 	and	 ana 	 gnorisis 	 	,	like	that	poor	little	lamb	,	who	i	hope	is	n't	 qui 	 ver 	 ing 	 	 any 	 more 	 	,	and	like	my	time	that	's	gone	.
it	's	 be 	 en 	 	great	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	you	and	get	back	to	work	,	will	you	?
