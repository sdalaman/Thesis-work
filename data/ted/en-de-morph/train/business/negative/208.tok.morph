i	even	have	 dream 	 s 	 	that	take	place	in	 land 	 scapes 	 	i	 recogn 	 ize 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 land 	 scapes 	 	of	hungarian	 film 	 s 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	the	early	 movie 	 s 	 	of	miklos	jancso	.
so	,	how	do	i	explain	 th 	 is 	 	 myster 	 ious 	 	 affin 	 ity 	 	?
 may 	 be 	 	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	my	native	state	of	south	carolina	,	which	is	not	much	 small 	 er 	 	than	present	-	day	hungary	,	once	 imagin 	 ed 	 	a	future	for	 it 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	 in 	 dependent 	 	country	.
and	 a 	 s 	 	a	 con 	 sequence 	 	of	that	presumption	,	my	 home 	 town 	 	was	 burn 	 ed 	 	to	the	ground	by	an	 invad 	 ing 	 	 arm 	 y 	 	,	an	experience	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 fall 	 en 	 	 man 	 y 	 	a	hungarian	town	and	village	 through 	 out 	 	 it 	 s 	 	long	and	 trouble 	 d 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
or	 may 	 be 	 	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	when	i	was	a	teenager	back	in	the	'50s	,	my	uncle	henry	--	 hav 	 ing 	 	 den 	 ounce 	 d 	 	the	ku	klux	klan	and	 be 	 en 	 	 bomb 	 ed 	 	for	his	trouble	and	had	 cross 	 es 	 	 burn 	 ed 	 	in	his	yard	,	living	under	death	threat	--	took	his	wife	and	children	to	massachusetts	for	 safe 	 ty 	 	and	went	back	to	south	carolina	to	face	down	the	klan	 al 	 one 	 	.
that	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	hungarian	thing	to	do	,	 a 	 s 	 	 any 	 one 	 	will	 at 	 test 	 	who	 remember 	 s 	 	1956	.
and	of	course	,	from	time	to	time	hungarians	have	 invent 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	the	klan	.
well	,	it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	that	 th 	 is 	 	hungarian	presence	in	my	life	is	difficult	to	account	for	,	but	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	i	 a 	 scribe 	 	it	to	an	 admi 	 ration 	 	for	people	with	a	complex	moral	 aware 	 ness 	 	,	with	a	heritage	of	guilt	and	defeat	 match 	 ed 	 	by	 defi 	 ance 	 	and	bravado	.
it	's	not	a	typical	 mind 	 set 	 	for	most	americans	,	but	it	is	 per 	 force 	 	typical	of	 virtual 	 ly 	 	all	hungarians	.
so	,	``	yo	 na 	 pot 	 	,	 pac 	 ak 	 	!	``
i	went	back	to	south	carolina	after	some	15	 year 	 s 	 	 a 	 mid 	 	the	alien	corn	at	the	tail	end	of	the	1960s	,	with	the	reckless	 con 	 descens 	 ion 	 	of	that	era	 think 	 ing 	 	i	would	 s 	 ave 	 	my	people	.
never	mind	the	fact	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 low 	 	to	 acknowledg 	 e 	 	they	 need 	 ed 	 	saving	.
i	 labor 	 ed 	 	in	that	 vine 	 yard 	 	for	a	quarter	century	before	making	my	way	to	a	little	 king 	 dom 	 	of	the	just	in	 up 	 state 	 	south	carolina	,	a	methodist	-	affiliated	institution	of	 high 	 er 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	wofford	college	.

he	went	to	the	commercial	business	high	school	 a 	 s 	 	a	young	man	in	budapest	,	and	there	he	was	 a 	 s 	 	smart	 a 	 s 	 	he	was	modest	and	he	 enjoy 	 ed 	 	a	 consider 	 able 	 	success	.	and	after	 gradu 	 ation 	 	when	he	went	 in 	 to 	 	 text 	 ile 	 	 engineer 	 ing 	 	,	the	success	 continu 	 ed 	 	.
he	built	one	plant	after	 an 	 other 	 	.
he	married	and	had	two	 son 	 s 	 	.	he	had	 friend 	 s 	 	in	high	 place 	 s 	 	who	 assur 	 ed 	 	him	that	he	was	of	great	value	to	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
once	,	 a 	 s 	 	he	had	left	 instruct 	 ions 	 	to	have	 d 	 one 	 	,	he	was	 summon 	 ed 	 	in	the	middle	of	the	night	by	the	night	 watch 	 man 	 	at	one	of	his	 plant 	 s 	 	.
the	night	 watch 	 man 	 	had	caught	an	 employ 	 ee 	 	who	was	 steal 	 ing 	 	 sock 	 s 	 	--	it	was	a	 ho 	 s 	 ier 	 y 	 	mill	,	and	he	 simpl 	 y 	 	 back 	 ed 	 	a	truck	up	to	the	 load 	 ing 	 	dock	and	was	 shove 	 ling 	 	in	 mountain 	 s 	 	of	 sock 	 s 	 	.
mr.	teszler	went	down	to	the	plant	and	 confront 	 ed 	 	the	 th 	 ie 	 f 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	but	why	do	you	steal	from	me	?	if	you	need	money	you	have	 on 	 ly 	 	to	ask	.	``

but	mr.	teszler	 answer 	 ed 	 	,	``	no	,	that	will	not	be	 necess 	 ary 	 	.
he	will	not	steal	from	us	 aga 	 in 	 	.	``
well	,	 may 	 be 	 	he	was	too	 trust 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 stay 	 ed 	 	where	he	was	long	after	the	nazi	anschluss	in	austria	and	even	after	the	 arrest 	 s 	 	and	 de 	 port 	 ations 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	in	budapest	.
he	took	the	simple	 pre 	 caution 	 	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	 cyan 	 ide 	 	 cap 	 sule 	 s 	 	 place 	 d 	 	in	 lock 	 et 	 s 	 	that	could	be	worn	about	the	 neck 	 s 	 	of	 him 	 self 	 	and	his	family	.
and	then	one	day	,	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	:	he	and	his	family	 we 	 re 	 	 arrest 	 ed 	 	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	taken	to	a	death	house	on	the	danube	.
in	 t 	 hose 	 	early	 day 	 s 	 	of	the	final	solution	,	it	was	 hand 	 craft 	 ed 	 	 brutal 	 ity 	 	;	people	 we 	 re 	 	 beat 	 en 	 	to	death	and	 the 	 ir 	 	bodies	 to 	 s 	 s 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	river	.
but	 non 	 e 	 	who	 enter 	 ed 	 	that	death	house	had	ever	come	out	 al 	 ive 	 	.
and	in	a	twist	you	would	not	 believ 	 e 	 	in	a	steven	spielberg	film	--	the	gauleiter	who	was	 over 	 see 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	brutal	 beat 	 ing 	 	was	the	 ver 	 y 	 	same	 th 	 ie 	 f 	 	who	had	 stole 	 n 	 	 sock 	 s 	 	from	mr.	teszler	's	 ho 	 s 	 ier 	 y 	 	mill	.
it	was	a	brutal	 beat 	 ing 	 	.	and	 mid 	 way 	 	through	that	 brutal 	 ity 	 	,	one	of	mr.	teszler	's	 son 	 s 	 	,	andrew	,	 look 	 ed 	 	up	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	is	it	time	to	take	the	 cap 	 sule 	 	now	,	papa	?	``

 prob 	 ably 	 	,	mr.	teszler	had	gotten	some	money	 in 	 to 	 	swiss	bank	 account 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 manage 	 d 	 	to	take	his	family	first	to	great	britain	,	then	to	long	 is 	 land 	 	and	then	to	the	center	of	the	 text 	 ile 	 	industry	in	the	american	south	.
which	,	 a 	 s 	 	chance	would	have	it	,	was	spartanburg	,	south	carolina	,	the	location	of	wofford	college	.

and	it	was	at	his	house	that	i	heard	for	the	first	time	bartok	's	third	piano	 concert 	 o 	 	and	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	mr.	teszler	that	it	had	 be 	 en 	 	 compose 	 d 	 	in	 near 	 by 	 	asheville	,	north	carolina	in	the	last	year	of	the	 compose 	 r 	 	's	life	.
he	was	 dy 	 ing 	 	of	leukemia	and	he	 k 	 new 	 	it	,	and	he	 dedicate 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 concert 	 o 	 	to	his	wife	,	dita	,	who	was	 her 	 self 	 	a	concert	pianist	.
and	 in 	 to 	 	the	 s 	 low 	 	,	second	 move 	 ment 	 	,	 mark 	 ed 	 	``	adagio	 relig 	 io 	 so 	 	,	``	he	 incorpo 	 rated 	 	the	 sound 	 s 	 	of	 bird 	 song 	 	that	he	heard	 out 	 side 	 	his	window	in	what	he	 k 	 new 	 	would	be	his	last	spring	;	he	was	 imagin 	 ing 	 	a	future	for	her	in	which	he	would	play	no	part	.
and	 clear 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 com 	 position 	 	is	his	final	 state 	 ment 	 	to	her	--	it	was	first	 perform 	 ed 	 	after	his	death	--	and	through	her	to	the	world	.
and	just	 a 	 s 	 	 clear 	 ly 	 	,	it	is	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	it	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	it	was	all	so	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.

it	was	 on 	 ly 	 	after	mr.	teszler	's	death	that	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	the	marker	on	the	grave	of	bela	bartok	in	hartsdale	,	new	york	was	paid	for	by	sandor	teszler	.	``	yo	 na 	 pot 	 	,	bela	!	``
not	long	before	mr.	teszler	's	own	death	at	the	age	of	97	,	he	heard	me	hold	forth	on	human	 ini 	 quit 	 y 	 	.

and	i	made	a	vow	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	then	and	there	,	that	if	 th 	 is 	 	man	who	had	 s 	 uch 	 	cause	to	think	 other 	 wise 	 	had	 reach 	 ed 	 	that	 con 	 clusion 	 	,	i	would	not	 p 	 resume 	 	to	differ	 un 	 til 	 	he	released	me	from	my	vow	.
and	now	he	's	dead	,	so	i	'm	 s 	 tuck 	 	with	my	vow	.
``	yo	 na 	 pot 	 	,	sandor	!	``
i	thought	my	skein	of	hungarian	 mentor 	 s 	 	had	come	to	an	end	,	but	 al 	 most 	 	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	i	met	francis	robicsek	,	a	hungarian	doctor	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	heart	surgeon	in	charlotte	,	north	carolina	,	then	in	his	late	 seven 	 ties 	 	--	who	had	 be 	 en 	 	a	pioneer	in	open	-	heart	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	,	and	,	 tinker 	 ing 	 	away	in	his	 gar 	 age 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	his	house	,	had	 invent 	 ed 	 	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	that	are	standard	 part 	 s 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 procedure 	 s 	 	.

he	's	the	author	of	seven	 book 	 s 	 	,	six	of	them	on	mayan	 ceramic 	 s 	 	.
it	was	he	who	broke	the	mayan	 cod 	 ex 	 	,	 enabl 	 ing 	 	 scholar 	 s 	 	to	 re 	 late 	 	the	 pic 	 to 	 graph 	 s 	 	on	mayan	 ceramic 	 s 	 	to	the	hieroglyphs	of	the	mayan	script	.
on	the	occasion	of	my	first	visit	,	we	 tour 	 ed 	 	his	house	and	we	saw	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 work 	 s 	 	of	museum	quality	,	and	then	we	 pause 	 d 	 	in	front	of	a	closed	door	and	dr.	robicsek	 s 	 aid 	 	,	with	obvious	 pri 	 de 	 	,	``	now	for	the	piece	de	 resist 	 ance 	 	.	``

if	they	did	n't	like	each	other	,	we	could	all	get	 tramp 	 led 	 	to	death	.

they	got	 a 	 long 	 	 famous 	 ly 	 	 un 	 til 	 	the	 ver 	 y 	 	end	of	the	meal	,	and	then	they	got	 in 	 to 	 	a	 fur 	 ious 	 	argument	.
