a	great	way	to	start	,	i	think	,	with	my	view	of	 simpl 	 icity 	 	is	to	take	a	look	at	ted	.	here	you	are	,	 understand 	 ing 	 	why	we	're	here	,	what	's	going	on	with	no	 difficult 	 y 	 	at	all	.
the	best	a.i	.	in	the	planet	would	find	it	complex	and	 con 	 fusing 	 	,	and	my	little	dog	watson	would	find	it	simple	and	 understand 	 able 	 	but	would	 mis 	 s 	 	the	point	.
he	would	have	a	great	time	.
and	of	course	,	if	you	're	a	speaker	here	,	like	hans	rosling	,	a	speaker	 find 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	complex	,	 trick 	 y 	 	.	but	in	hans	rosling	's	case	,	he	had	a	secret	weapon	 yester 	 day 	 	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	in	his	 s 	 word 	 	 swallow 	 ing 	 	act	.
and	i	must	say	,	i	thought	of	 quit 	 e 	 	a	few	 object 	 s 	 	that	i	might	try	to	swallow	 to 	 day 	 	and	 final 	 ly 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	up	on	,	but	he	just	did	it	and	that	was	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	thing	.
so	puck	 me 	 ant 	 	not	 on 	 ly 	 	are	we	 fool 	 s 	 	in	the	 pe 	 jo 	 rative 	 	sense	,	but	that	we	're	 eas 	 ily 	 	 fool 	 ed 	 	.	in	fact	,	what	shakespeare	was	 point 	 ing 	 	out	is	we	go	to	the	theater	in	order	to	be	 fool 	 ed 	 	,	so	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	looking	forward	to	it	.
we	go	to	magic	 show 	 s 	 	in	order	to	be	 fool 	 ed 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	 make 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 f 	 un 	 	,	but	it	 make 	 s 	 	it	difficult	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	any	kind	of	picture	on	the	world	we	live	in	or	on	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
and	our	friend	,	betty	edwards	,	the	``	 draw 	 ing 	 	on	the	right	side	of	the	brain	``	 lad 	 y 	 	,	 show 	 s 	 	these	two	 table 	 s 	 	to	her	 draw 	 ing 	 	class	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	the	problem	you	have	with	 learn 	 ing 	 	to	draw	is	not	that	you	ca	n't	move	your	hand	,	but	that	the	way	your	brain	 perceive 	 s 	 	 image 	 s 	 	is	 fault 	 y 	 	.
it	's	 try 	 ing 	 	to	perceive	 image 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 object 	 s 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 see 	 ing 	 	what	's	there	.	``
and	to	prove	it	,	she	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	the	exact	 s 	 ize 	 	and	shape	of	these	 table 	 top 	 s 	 	is	the	same	,	and	i	'm	going	to	prove	it	to	you	.	``
she	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	with	 card 	 board 	 	,	but	since	i	have	an	expensive	computer	here	i	'll	just	 rot 	 ate 	 	 th 	 is 	 	little	guy	around	and	...
now	 hav 	 ing 	 	 s 	 een 	 	that	--	and	i	've	 s 	 een 	 	it	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 time 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	i	use	 th 	 is 	 	in	every	talk	i	give	--	i	still	ca	n't	see	that	they	're	the	same	 s 	 ize 	 	and	shape	,	and	i	doubt	that	you	can	either	.
so	what	do	 artist 	 s 	 	do	?	well	,	what	 artist 	 s 	 	do	is	to	measure	.
they	measure	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 care 	 fully 	 	.
and	if	you	measure	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 care 	 fully 	 	with	a	stiff	arm	and	a	straight	edge	,	you	'll	see	that	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 shape 	 s 	 	are	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	 s 	 ize 	 	.
and	the	talmud	saw	 th 	 is 	 	a	long	time	ago	,	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	we	see	 thing 	 s 	 	not	 a 	 s 	 	they	are	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	we	are	.	``
i	 certain 	 ly 	 	would	like	to	know	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	the	person	who	had	that	 in 	 sight 	 	back	then	,	if	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	 follow 	 ed 	 	it	to	 it 	 s 	 	ultimate	 con 	 clusion 	 	.
so	if	the	world	is	not	 a 	 s 	 	it	 seem 	 s 	 	and	we	see	 thing 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	are	,	then	what	we	call	 re 	 ality 	 	is	a	kind	of	 hallucin 	 ation 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	 in 	 side 	 	here	.	it	's	a	 wa 	 king 	 	dream	,	and	 understand 	 ing 	 	that	that	is	what	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	exist	in	is	one	of	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 epistemo 	 logical 	 	 bar 	 rier 	 s 	 	in	human	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
and	what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	:	``	simple	and	 understand 	 able 	 	``	might	not	be	 actual 	 ly 	 	simple	or	 understand 	 able 	 	,	and	 thing 	 s 	 	we	think	are	``	complex	``	might	be	made	simple	and	 understand 	 able 	 	.
 some 	 how 	 	we	have	to	understand	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	get	around	our	 flaw 	 s 	 	.
we	can	think	of	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 a 	 s 	 	kind	of	a	noisy	channel	.
the	way	i	think	of	it	is	,	we	ca	n't	learn	to	see	 un 	 til 	 	we	admit	we	're	blind	.
once	you	start	down	at	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	humble	level	,	then	you	can	start	 find 	 ing 	 	ways	to	see	 thing 	 s 	 	.
and	what	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	over	the	last	400	 year 	 s 	 	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	is	that	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	have	 invent 	 ed 	 	``	 brain 	 lets 	 	``	--	little	 add 	 ition 	 al 	 	 part 	 s 	 	for	our	brain	--	made	out	of	 power 	 ful 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	that	help	us	see	the	world	in	different	ways	.
and	these	are	in	the	form	of	 sensor 	 y 	 	apparatus	--	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	,	 micro 	 scope 	 s 	 	--	 reason 	 ing 	 	apparatus	--	 vari 	 ous 	 	ways	of	 think 	 ing 	 	--	and	,	most	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	in	the	ability	to	change	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	on	 thing 	 s 	 	.
i	'll	talk	about	that	a	little	bit	.
it	's	 th 	 is 	 	change	in	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	on	what	it	is	we	think	we	're	 per 	 ceiv 	 ing 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 help 	 ed 	 	us	make	more	progress	in	the	last	400	 year 	 s 	 	than	we	have	in	the	rest	of	human	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
and	yet	,	it	is	not	taught	in	any	k	through	12	curriculum	in	america	that	i	'm	aware	of	.
so	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 go 	 es 	 	from	simple	to	complex	is	when	we	do	more	.	we	like	more	.
if	we	do	more	in	a	kind	of	a	stupid	way	,	the	 simpl 	 icity 	 	 get 	 s 	 	complex	and	,	in	fact	,	we	can	keep	on	 do 	 ing 	 	it	for	a	 ver 	 y 	 	long	time	.
but	murray	gell	-	mann	 yester 	 day 	 	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	 emerge 	 nt 	 	 proper 	 ties 	 	;	 an 	 other 	 	name	for	them	could	be	``	 architect 	 ure 	 	``	 a 	 s 	 	a	metaphor	for	taking	the	same	old	material	and	 think 	 ing 	 	about	non	-	obvious	,	non	-	simple	ways	of	 comb 	 in 	 ing 	 	it	.
and	in	fact	,	what	murray	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 yester 	 day 	 	in	the	 fract 	 al 	 	 beaut 	 y 	 	of	nature	--	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	 de 	 script 	 ions 	 	at	 vari 	 ous 	 	 level 	 s 	 	be	 ra 	 ther 	 	similar	--	all	 go 	 es 	 	down	to	the	idea	that	the	 element 	 ary 	 	 particle 	 s 	 	are	both	 stick 	 y 	 	and	 stand 	 off 	 ish 	 	,	and	they	're	in	violent	motion	.
 t 	 hose 	 	three	 thing 	 s 	 	give	rise	to	all	the	different	 level 	 s 	 	of	what	seem	to	be	 complex 	 ity 	 	in	our	world	.
but	how	simple	?
so	,	when	i	saw	roslings	'	gapminder	stuff	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	just	thought	it	was	the	 great 	 est 	 	thing	i	'd	 s 	 een 	 	in	 convey 	 ing 	 	complex	 idea 	 s 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	.
but	then	i	had	a	thought	of	,	``	boy	,	 may 	 be 	 	it	's	too	simple	.	``
and	i	put	some	effort	in	to	try	and	check	to	see	how	well	these	simple	 port 	 ray 	 al 	 s 	 	of	 trend 	 s 	 	over	time	 actual 	 ly 	 	 match 	 ed 	 	up	with	some	 idea 	 s 	 	and	 investigation 	 s 	 	from	the	side	,	and	i	found	that	they	 match 	 ed 	 	up	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.
so	the	roslings	have	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	do	 simpl 	 icity 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 re 	 moving 	 	what	's	 import 	 ant 	 	about	the	data	.
 where 	 a 	 s 	 	the	film	 yester 	 day 	 	that	we	saw	of	the	 simul 	 ation 	 	of	the	 in 	 side 	 	of	a	cell	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 form 	 er 	 	 mole 	 cular 	 	biologist	,	i	did	n't	like	that	at	all	.
not	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	n't	 beaut 	 iful 	 	or	 any 	 thing 	 	,	but	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 mis 	 s 	 es 	 	the	thing	that	most	 student 	 s 	 	fail	to	understand	about	 mole 	 cular 	 	biology	,	and	that	is	:	why	is	there	any	 prob 	 ability 	 	at	all	of	two	complex	 shape 	 s 	 	 find 	 ing 	 	each	other	just	the	right	way	so	they	combine	together	and	be	 catalyze 	 d 	 	?
and	what	we	saw	 yester 	 day 	 	was	every	 re 	 action 	 	was	fortuitous	;	they	just	 swoop 	 ed 	 	in	the	air	and	bound	,	and	 some 	 thing 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
but	in	fact	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 molecule 	 s 	 	are	 s 	 pinning 	 	at	the	rate	of	about	a	million	 revolution 	 s 	 	per	second	;	they	're	 agit 	 ating 	 	back	and	forth	 the 	 ir 	 	 s 	 ize 	 	every	two	 nano 	 second 	 s 	 	;	they	're	 complete 	 ly 	 	 crowd 	 ed 	 	together	,	they	're	 jamm 	 ed 	 	,	they	're	 bash 	 ing 	 	up	against	each	other	.
and	if	you	do	n't	understand	that	in	your	mental	model	of	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	,	what	 happen 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	of	a	cell	 seem 	 s 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	 myster 	 ious 	 	and	fortuitous	,	and	i	think	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	wrong	image	for	when	you	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	teach	science	.
so	,	 an 	 other 	 	thing	that	we	do	is	to	 con 	 fuse 	 	adult	 sophistic 	 ation 	 	with	the	actual	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	some	principle	.
so	a	kid	who	's	14	in	high	school	 get 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	version	of	the	pythagorean	 theor 	 em 	 	,	which	is	a	 tru 	 ly 	 	subtle	and	 interest 	 ing 	 	proof	,	but	in	fact	it	's	not	a	good	way	to	start	 learn 	 ing 	 	about	 mathematic 	 s 	 	.
so	a	more	direct	one	,	one	that	 give 	 s 	 	you	more	of	the	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	math	,	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 close 	 r 	 	to	pythagoras	'	own	proof	,	which	 go 	 es 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	:	so	here	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	triangle	,	and	if	we	surround	that	c	square	with	three	more	 triangle 	 s 	 	and	we	copy	that	,	notice	that	we	can	move	 t 	 hose 	 	 triangle 	 s 	 	down	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	that	 leav 	 es 	 	two	open	 area 	 s 	 	that	are	kind	of	suspicious	...
and	 bing 	 o 	 	.	that	is	all	you	have	to	do	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	proof	is	the	kind	of	proof	that	you	need	to	learn	when	you	're	 learn 	 ing 	 	 mathematic 	 s 	 	in	order	to	get	an	idea	of	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	before	you	look	 in 	 to 	 	the	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	1,200	or	1,500	 proof 	 s 	 	of	pythagoras	'	 theor 	 em 	 	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	.
now	let	's	go	to	young	children	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 usual 	 	teacher	who	was	a	 kind 	 ergarten 	 	and	first	-	grade	teacher	,	but	was	a	natural	 mathematic 	 ian 	 	.
so	she	was	like	that	jazz	 music 	 ian 	 	friend	you	have	who	never	 stud 	 ied 	 	music	but	is	a	 terr 	 ific 	 	 music 	 ian 	 	;	she	just	had	a	 feel 	 ing 	 	for	math	.
and	here	are	her	six	-	year	-	olds	,	and	she	's	got	them	making	 shape 	 s 	 	out	of	a	shape	.
so	they	pick	a	shape	they	like	--	like	a	diamond	,	or	a	square	,	or	a	triangle	,	or	a	trapezoid	--	and	then	they	try	and	make	the	next	 large 	 r 	 	shape	of	that	same	shape	,	and	the	next	 large 	 r 	 	shape	.
you	can	see	the	 trapezoid 	 s 	 	are	a	little	 challeng 	 ing 	 	there	.
and	what	 th 	 is 	 	teacher	did	on	every	project	was	to	have	the	children	act	like	first	it	was	a	creative	 art 	 s 	 	project	,	and	then	 some 	 thing 	 	like	science	.
so	they	had	 create 	 d 	 	these	 artifact 	 s 	 	.
now	she	had	them	look	at	them	and	do	 th 	 is 	 	...	 labor 	 ious 	 	,	which	i	thought	for	a	long	time	,	 un 	 til 	 	she	 explain 	 ed 	 	to	me	was	to	 s 	 low 	 	them	down	so	they	'll	think	.
so	they	're	cutting	out	the	little	 piece 	 s 	 	of	 card 	 board 	 	here	and	 past 	 ing 	 	them	up	.
but	the	whole	point	of	 th 	 is 	 	thing	is	for	them	to	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	chart	and	fill	it	out	.
``	what	have	you	 notice 	 d 	 	about	what	you	did	?	``
and	so	six	-	year	-	old	lauren	there	 notice 	 d 	 	that	the	first	one	took	one	,	and	the	second	one	took	three	more	and	the	total	was	four	on	that	one	,	the	third	one	took	five	more	and	the	total	was	nine	on	that	one	,	and	then	the	next	one	.
she	saw	right	away	that	the	 add 	 ition 	 al 	 	 tile 	 s 	 	that	you	had	to	add	around	the	 edge 	 s 	 	was	 al 	 ways 	 	going	to	grow	by	two	,	so	she	was	 ver 	 y 	 	confident	about	how	she	made	 t 	 hose 	 	 number 	 s 	 	there	.
and	she	could	see	that	these	 we 	 re 	 	the	square	 number 	 s 	 	up	 un 	 til 	 	about	six	,	where	she	was	n't	 s 	 ure 	 	what	six	 time 	 s 	 	six	was	and	what	seven	 time 	 s 	 	seven	was	,	but	then	she	was	confident	 aga 	 in 	 	.
so	that	's	what	lauren	did	.
and	then	the	teacher	,	gillian	ishijima	,	had	the	 kid 	 s 	 	 br 	 ing 	 	all	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 project 	 s 	 	up	to	the	front	of	the	room	and	put	them	on	the	floor	,	and	 every 	 body 	 	went	 bat 	 shit 	 	:	``	holy	shit	!	they	're	the	same	!	``
no	matter	what	the	 shape 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	,	the	growth	law	is	the	same	.
and	the	 mathematic 	 ians 	 	and	 scientist 	 s 	 	in	the	crowd	will	 recogn 	 ize 	 	these	two	 progress 	 ions 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	first	-	order	discrete	 different 	 ial 	 	 equ 	 ation 	 	and	a	second	-	order	discrete	 different 	 ial 	 	 equ 	 ation 	 	,	derived	by	six	-	year	-	olds	.
well	,	that	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
that	is	n't	what	we	 usual 	 ly 	 	try	to	teach	six	-	year	-	olds	.
so	,	let	's	take	a	look	now	at	how	we	might	use	the	computer	for	some	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	so	the	first	idea	here	is	just	to	show	you	the	kind	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	children	do	.
i	'm	using	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	that	we	're	 put 	 ting 	 	on	the	$	100	 lap 	 top 	 	.
so	i	'd	like	to	draw	a	little	car	here	--	i	'll	just	do	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	--	and	put	a	big	tire	on	him	.
and	i	get	a	little	object	here	and	i	can	look	 in 	 side 	 	 th 	 is 	 	object	,	i	'll	call	it	a	car	.	and	here	's	a	little	behavior	:	car	forward	.
each	time	i	click	it	,	car	turn	.
if	i	want	to	make	a	little	script	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	,	i	just	drag	these	 guy 	 s 	 	out	and	set	them	going	.
and	i	can	try	 steer 	 ing 	 	the	car	here	by	...
see	the	car	turn	by	five	here	?
so	what	if	i	click	 th 	 is 	 	down	to	zero	?
it	 go 	 es 	 	straight	.	that	's	a	big	 revel 	 ation 	 	for	nine	-	year	-	olds	.
make	it	go	in	the	other	direction	.
but	of	course	,	that	's	a	little	bit	like	 kiss 	 ing 	 	your	sister	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	 driv 	 ing 	 	a	car	,	so	the	 kid 	 s 	 	want	to	do	a	 steer 	 ing 	 	wheel	;	so	they	draw	a	 steer 	 ing 	 	wheel	.
and	we	'll	call	 th 	 is 	 	a	wheel	.
see	 th 	 is 	 	wheel	's	 head 	 ing 	 	here	?
if	i	turn	 th 	 is 	 	wheel	,	you	can	see	that	number	over	there	going	minus	and	positive	.
that	's	kind	of	an	 invit 	 ation 	 	to	pick	up	 th 	 is 	 	name	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 number 	 s 	 	coming	out	there	and	to	just	drop	it	 in 	 to 	 	the	script	here	,	and	now	i	can	steer	the	car	with	the	 steer 	 ing 	 	wheel	.
and	it	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
you	know	how	much	trouble	the	children	have	with	 vari 	 able 	 s 	 	,	but	by	 learn 	 ing 	 	it	 th 	 is 	 	way	,	in	a	 situ 	 ated 	 	fashion	,	they	never	forget	from	 th 	 is 	 	single	trial	what	a	 vari 	 able 	 	is	and	how	to	use	it	.
and	we	can	reflect	here	the	way	gillian	ishijima	did	.
so	if	you	look	at	the	little	script	here	,	the	speed	is	 al 	 ways 	 	going	to	be	30	.
we	're	going	to	move	the	car	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	that	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	.
and	i	'm	dropping	a	little	dot	for	each	one	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	;	they	're	 even 	 ly 	 	 space 	 d 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	30	 a 	 part 	 	.
and	what	if	i	do	 th 	 is 	 	 progress 	 ion 	 	that	the	six	-	year	-	olds	did	of	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	ok	,	i	'm	going	to	 in 	 crease 	 	the	speed	by	two	each	time	,	and	then	i	'm	going	to	 in 	 crease 	 	the	distance	by	the	speed	each	time	?
what	do	i	get	there	?	``
we	get	a	visual	pattern	of	what	these	nine	-	year	-	olds	 call 	 ed 	 	 accele 	 ration 	 	.
so	how	do	the	children	do	science	?
teacher	:	[	 choos 	 e 	 	]	 object 	 s 	 	that	you	think	will	fall	to	the	earth	at	the	same	time	.
student	1	:	ooh	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	nice	.
teacher	:	do	not	pay	any	attention	to	what	 any 	 body 	 	else	is	 do 	 ing 	 	.
who	's	got	the	apple	?
alan	kay	:	they	've	got	little	 stop 	 watch 	 es 	 	.
student	2	:	what	did	you	get	?	what	did	you	get	?
ak	:	 stop 	 watch 	 es 	 	are	n't	accurate	 en 	 ough 	 	.
student	3	:	0.99	 second 	 s 	 	.
teacher	:	so	put	``	sponge	ball	``	...
student	4l	:	[	i	 decide 	 d 	 	to	]	do	the	shot	put	and	the	sponge	ball	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	two	 total 	 ly 	 	different	 weight 	 s 	 	,	and	if	you	drop	them	at	the	same	time	,	 may 	 be 	 	they	'll	drop	at	the	same	speed	.
teacher	:	drop	.	class	:	 who 	 a 	 	!
ak	:	so	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	aristotle	never	 ask 	 ed 	 	a	child	about	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	point	 be 	 cause 	 	,	of	course	,	he	did	n't	 both 	 er 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	the	experiment	,	and	 n 	 either 	 	did	st.	thomas	aquinas	.
and	it	was	not	 un 	 til 	 	galileo	 actual 	 ly 	 	did	it	that	an	adult	thought	like	a	child	,	 on 	 ly 	 	400	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
we	get	one	child	like	that	about	every	 class 	 room 	 	of	30	 kid 	 s 	 	who	will	 actual 	 ly 	 	cut	straight	to	the	chase	.
now	,	what	if	we	want	to	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	more	 close 	 ly 	 	?
we	can	take	a	movie	of	what	's	going	on	,	but	even	if	we	single	 steppe 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	movie	,	it	's	 trick 	 y 	 	to	see	what	's	going	on	.
and	so	what	we	can	do	is	we	can	lay	out	the	 frame 	 s 	 	side	by	side	or	stack	them	up	.
so	when	the	children	see	 th 	 is 	 	,	they	say	,	``	ah	!	 accele 	 ration 	 	,	``	 remember 	 ing 	 	back	four	 month 	 s 	 	when	they	did	 the 	 ir 	 	 car 	 s 	 	 side 	 ways 	 	,	and	they	start	 measur 	 ing 	 	to	find	out	what	kind	of	 accele 	 ration 	 	it	is	.
so	what	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	is	 measur 	 ing 	 	from	the	bottom	of	one	image	to	the	bottom	of	the	next	image	,	about	a	fifth	of	a	second	 lat 	 er 	 	,	like	that	.	and	they	're	 get 	 ting 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	and	 fast 	 er 	 	each	time	,	and	if	i	stack	these	 guy 	 s 	 	up	,	then	we	see	the	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	;	the	 in 	 crease 	 	in	the	speed	is	constant	.
and	they	say	,	``	oh	,	 yea 	 h 	 	.	constant	 accele 	 ration 	 	.
we	've	 d 	 one 	 	that	 al 	 ready 	 	.	``
and	how	 s 	 hall 	 	we	look	and	 ver 	 ify 	 	that	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	it	?
so	you	ca	n't	tell	much	from	just	making	the	ball	drop	there	,	but	if	we	drop	the	ball	and	run	the	movie	at	the	same	time	,	we	can	see	that	we	have	come	up	with	an	accurate	physical	model	.
galileo	,	by	the	way	,	did	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 clever 	 ly 	 	by	running	a	ball	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	down	the	 string 	 s 	 	of	his	lute	.
i	 pull 	 ed 	 	out	 t 	 hose 	 	 apple 	 s 	 	to	 re 	 mind 	 	 my 	 self 	 	to	tell	you	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 prob 	 ably 	 	a	newton	and	the	apple	type	story	,	but	it	's	a	great	story	.
and	i	thought	i	would	do	just	one	thing	on	the	$	100	 lap 	 top 	 	here	just	to	prove	that	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	 work 	 s 	 	here	.
so	once	you	have	 gravit 	 y 	 	,	here	's	 th 	 is 	 	--	 in 	 crease 	 	the	speed	by	 some 	 thing 	 	,	 in 	 crease 	 	the	ship	's	speed	.
if	i	start	the	little	game	here	that	the	 kid 	 s 	 	have	 d 	 one 	 	,	it	'll	crash	the	space	ship	.
but	if	i	 oppos 	 e 	 	 gravit 	 y 	 	,	here	we	go	...	 oop 	 s 	 	!
one	more	.
 yea 	 h 	 	,	there	we	go	.	 yea 	 h 	 	,	ok	?
i	guess	the	best	way	to	end	 th 	 is 	 	is	with	two	 quote 	 s 	 	:	marshall	mcluhan	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	children	are	the	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	that	we	 s 	 end 	 	to	the	future	,	``	but	in	fact	,	if	you	think	of	it	,	children	are	the	future	we	 s 	 end 	 	to	the	future	.
forget	about	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	;	children	are	the	future	,	and	children	in	the	first	and	second	world	and	,	most	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	,	in	the	third	world	need	 mentor 	 s 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	summer	,	we	're	going	to	build	five	million	of	these	$	100	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	50	million	next	year	.
but	we	could	n't	create	1,000	new	 teacher 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	summer	to	 s 	 ave 	 	our	life	.
that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	we	,	once	 aga 	 in 	 	,	have	a	thing	where	we	can	put	technology	out	,	but	the	 mentor 	 ing 	 	that	is	 requir 	 ed 	 	to	go	from	a	simple	new	ichat	instant	 mess 	 aging 	 	system	to	 some 	 thing 	 	with	depth	is	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	.
i	 believ 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 d 	 one 	 	with	a	new	kind	of	user	 inter 	 face 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	new	kind	of	user	 inter 	 face 	 	could	be	 d 	 one 	 	with	an	 expend 	 iture 	 	of	about	100	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
it	 sound 	 s 	 	like	a	lot	,	but	it	is	 liter 	 ally 	 	18	 minute 	 s 	 	of	what	we	're	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	in	 ir 	 aq 	 	--	we	're	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	8	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	month	;	18	 minute 	 s 	 	is	100	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	--	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	cheap	.
and	einstein	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 thing 	 s 	 	should	be	 a 	 s 	 	simple	 a 	 s 	 	possible	,	but	not	 simpl 	 er 	 	.	``
thank	you	.
