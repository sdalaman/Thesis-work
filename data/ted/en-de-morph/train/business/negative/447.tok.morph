i	've	 record 	 ed 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	cds	.
i	was	 nominate 	 d 	 	for	a	grammy	and	i	've	won	some	 a 	 ward 	 s 	 	and	stuff	like	that	,	so	that	's	awesome	,	but	the	best	part	was	 meet 	 ing 	 	my	husband	,	and	i	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	known	donnell	for	 prob 	 ably 	 	12	 year 	 s 	 	now	,	and	i	'm	going	to	get	 in 	 to 	 	a	little	bit	of	,	i	guess	,	how	music	 br 	 ought 	 	us	together	,	but	i	'm	going	to	 introduc 	 e 	 	you	right	now	to	my	new	husband	 a 	 s 	 	of	october	5	,	donnell	leahy	.

so	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	natalie	,	what	do	i	do	?
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	just	talk	about	 your 	 self 	 	.
it	's	kind	of	 bor 	 ing 	 	,	but	i	'll	just	tell	you	a	little	bit	about	my	family	.	i	'm	one	of	11	 brother 	 s 	 	and	 sister 	 s 	 	from	lakefield	,	ontario	,	an	hour	and	a	half	 north 	 east 	 	of	toronto	,	and	we	grew	up	on	a	farm	.
mom	and	dad	raised	beef	cattle	,	and	i	'm	the	 old 	 est 	 	boy	.
there	are	four	 girl 	 s 	 	a	little	bit	 old 	 er 	 	than	me	.
we	grew	up	 with 	 out 	 	a	 tele 	 vision 	 	.
people	find	that	strange	,	but	i	think	it	was	a	great	 bless 	 ing 	 	for	us	.
we	had	a	 tele 	 vision 	 	for	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	but	of	course	we	 waste 	 d 	 	so	much	time	and	the	work	was	n't	 get 	 ting 	 	 d 	 one 	 	,	so	out	went	the	 tele 	 vision 	 	.
we	grew	up	 play 	 ing 	 	--	mom	's	from	cape	breton	,	 co 	 incident 	 ally 	 	.
mom	and	natalie	's	mother	 k 	 new 	 	each	other	.	we	grew	up	 play 	 ing 	 	,	and	used	to	dance	together	,	right	,	 yea 	 h 	 	.
we	grew	up	 play 	 ing 	 	a	bunch	of	,	we	 play 	 ed 	 	by	ear	and	i	think	that	's	 import 	 ant 	 	for	us	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	not	 re 	 ally 	 	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	to	a	lot	of	different	 style 	 s 	 	of	music	.
we	 learn 	 ed 	 	to	play	the	 instrument 	 s 	 	,	but	we	kind	of	had	to	come	from	 with 	 in 	 	or	go	from	 with 	 in 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	did	n't	watch	 tele 	 vision 	 	,	we	did	n't	listen	to	a	lot	of	radio	.	we	went	to	church	and	to	school	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	and	 farm 	 ed 	 	and	 play 	 ed 	 	music	,	so	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	,	i	think	,	at	a	 ver 	 y 	 	critical	age	to	develop	our	own	style	,	our	own	self	,	and	my	mother	 play 	 s 	 	,	my	father	 play 	 s 	 	,	and	the	style	that	came	from	the	ottawa	 val 	 ley 	 	in	ontario	,	we	call	it	french	-	canadian	style	but	it	 origin 	 ated 	 	in	logging	 camp 	 s 	 	.
 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	men	would	go	up	for	the	winter	to	the	 camp 	 s 	 	in	 north 	 ern 	 	ontario	and	in	quebec	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	all	different	 culture 	 s 	 	,	and	the	irish	,	the	french	,	scottish	,	german	,	they	'd	all	meet	,	and	of	course	at	night	,	they	'd	play	 card 	 s 	 	and	step	dance	and	play	 fiddl 	 es 	 	,	and	over	the	course	of	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	ottawa	 val 	 ley 	 	 fiddl 	 ing 	 	kind	of	 evolv 	 ed 	 	and	the	ottawa	 val 	 ley 	 	step	 danc 	 ing 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	,	so	that	's	,	i	kind	of	 start 	 ed 	 	out	with	that	style	and	i	 quick 	 ly 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	my	own	thing	,	and	then	i	met	natalie	,	and	i	was	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	to	the	great	cape	breton	 fiddl 	 ing 	 	.
that	's	how	we	met	.
you	tell	them	.
nm	:	you	want	to	or	no	?
well	i	guess	i	have	to	now	.
well	,	it	's	just	so	 interest 	 ing 	 	that	donnell	's	 up 	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	was	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	to	mine	,	and	i	 actual 	 ly 	 	saw	donnell	play	when	i	was	about	12	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	and	he	and	his	family	came	to	inverness	,	which	is	about	45	 minute 	 s 	 	from	where	i	lived	,	and	i	was	just	blown	away	,	like	,	it	was	just	 amaz 	 ing 	 	,	and	you	'll	find	out	why	 pre 	 tty 	 	soon	here	,	but	i	could	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	the	 fiddl 	 ing 	 	and	mom	was	there	with	me	,	and	she	was	 say 	 ing 	 	--	donnell	's	mother	came	up	on	stage	and	 danc 	 ed 	 	with	her	children	,	and	mom	was	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	that	's	julie	macdonnell	,	i	used	to	dance	with	her	when	we	 we 	 re 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	.	little	did	i	think	our	children	would	be	 play 	 ing 	 	 instrument 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	 play 	 ing 	 	music	,	 yea 	 h 	 	.	``
twelve	 year 	 s 	 	,	er	,	20	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	little	did	she	think	her	 kid 	 s 	 	would	be	 get 	 ting 	 	married	,	but	 any 	 way 	 	,	so	,	then	i	got	a	phone	call	about	,	i	dunno	,	seven	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.	i	was	19	,	first	or	second	year	of	college	,	and	it	was	donnell	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	``	hi	,	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	do	n't	know	me	but	my	name	is	donnell	leahy	.	``
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	know	you	.
i	have	a	tape	of	 your 	 s 	 	at	home	.	``
and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	well	,	i	'm	in	truro	,	``	which	is	where	i	was	,	and	he	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	out	for	 s 	 upper 	 	.
that	's	it	.
then	--	will	i	keep	going	?
then	we	 d 	 ated 	 	for	two	 year 	 s 	 	,	broke	up	for	10	,	got	back	together	and	got	married	.
dl	:	so	 any 	 way 	 	,	we	're	running	out	of	time	,	so	i	'll	just	get	to	it	.
i	'm	going	to	play	a	piece	of	music	for	you	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	scottish	piece	i	've	 chose 	 n 	 	.
i	 start 	 s 	 	out	with	a	 s 	 low 	 	air	.
 air 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 play 	 ed 	 	in	europe	at	 burial 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	body	was	carried	out	from	the	wake	 s 	 ite 	 	to	the	burial	 s 	 ite 	 	,	the	 process 	 ion 	 	was	led	by	a	 pipe 	 r 	 	or	a	 fiddl 	 e 	 	player	.
i	'll	 quick 	 ly 	 	play	a	short	part	of	the	air	,	and	then	i	'm	going	to	get	 in 	 to 	 	kind	of	a	crazy	tune	that	is	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	to	play	when	you	're	not	 warm 	 ed 	 	up	,	so	,	if	i	mess	it	up	,	pretend	you	like	it	 any 	 way 	 	.	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 bank 	 s 	 	.
nm	:	well	,	we	're	gon	na	play	one	together	now	.
we	're	 laugh 	 ing 	 	,	like	,	 be 	 cause 	 	our	 style 	 s 	 	are	 total 	 ly 	 	different	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	hear	.
and	so	,	you	know	,	donnell	and	i	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	in	the	process	of	writing	new	 piece 	 s 	 	of	music	together	that	we	can	play	,	but	we	do	n't	have	any	of	 t 	 hose 	 	ready	.

the	cape	breton	piano	 play 	 ing 	 	is	just	awesome	.	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 rhythm 	 ic 	 	and	,	you	'll	see	it	.
my	mom	 play 	 s 	 	piano	,	and	she	 learn 	 ed 	 	to	play	before	they	had	a	piano	at	home	in	cape	breton	.	before	mom	's	family	had	a	piano	in	cape	breton	,	she	 learn 	 ed 	 	to	play	the	 rhythm 	 s 	 	on	a	piece	of	board	,	and	the	fiddlers	would	all	 congreg 	 ate 	 	to	play	on	the	cold	winter	's	 even 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	mom	would	be	 bang 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	board	,	so	when	they	 b 	 ought 	 	a	piano	,	they	 b 	 ought 	 	it	in	toronto	and	had	it	taken	by	train	and	 br 	 ought 	 	in	on	a	horse	,	a	horse	and	sleigh	to	the	house	.

it	had	gone	through	,	like	,	five	or	six	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	,	and	it	was	just	a	big	thing	for	us	,	and	we	found	 actual 	 ly 	 	an	old	picture	of	 some 	 body 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	family	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
 any 	 way 	 	,	i	'm	blabbering	on	here	.
