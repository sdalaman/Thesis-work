 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	 hook 	 ed 	 	on	a	 feel 	 ing 	 	:	the	 pur 	 suit 	 	of	happiness	and	human	design	.
i	put	up	a	 some 	 what 	 	 d 	 our 	 	darwin	,	but	a	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	chimp	up	there	.
my	first	point	is	that	the	 pur 	 suit 	 	of	happiness	is	 oblig 	 atory 	 	.
man	 wish 	 es 	 	to	be	happy	,	 on 	 ly 	 	 wish 	 es 	 	to	be	happy	,	and	can	not	wish	not	to	be	so	.
we	are	wired	to	pursue	happiness	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	to	enjoy	it	,	but	to	want	more	and	more	of	it	.
so	 give 	 n 	 	that	that	's	true	,	how	good	are	we	at	increasing	our	happiness	?
well	,	we	 certain 	 ly 	 	try	.
if	you	look	on	the	amazon	 s 	 ite 	 	,	there	are	over	2,000	 title 	 s 	 	with	 ad 	 vice 	 	on	the	seven	 habit 	 s 	 	,	the	nine	 choice 	 s 	 	,	the	10	 secret 	 s 	 	,	the	14,000	 thought 	 s 	 	that	are	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	happiness	.
now	 an 	 other 	 	way	we	try	to	 in 	 crease 	 	our	happiness	is	we	 medic 	 ate 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
and	so	there	's	over	120	million	 prescription 	 s 	 	out	there	for	 anti 	 depress 	 ants 	 	.
prozac	was	 re 	 ally 	 	the	first	absolute	 block 	 buster 	 	drug	.
it	was	clean	,	efficient	,	there	was	no	high	,	there	was	 re 	 ally 	 	no	danger	,	it	had	no	street	value	.
in	1995	,	 il 	 legal 	 	 drug 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	a	$	400	billion	business	,	 represent 	 ing 	 	eight	percent	of	world	trade	,	 rough 	 ly 	 	the	same	 a 	 s 	 	gas	and	oil	.
these	 route 	 s 	 	to	happiness	have	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	happiness	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
one	problem	that	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	now	is	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	the	rates	of	happiness	are	about	 a 	 s 	 	flat	 a 	 s 	 	the	surface	of	the	moon	,	 depress 	 ion 	 	and	 anxie 	 ty 	 	are	 ris 	 ing 	 	.
some	people	say	 th 	 is 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	better	 diagnos 	 is 	 	,	and	more	people	are	 be 	 ing 	 	found	out	.
it	is	n't	just	that	.	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	it	all	over	the	world	.
in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	right	now	there	are	more	 sui 	 cides 	 	than	 hom 	 icide 	 s 	 	.
there	is	a	rash	of	 su 	 icide 	 	in	 chin 	 a 	 	.
and	the	world	health	 organ 	 ization 	 	 predict 	 s 	 	by	the	year	2020	that	 depress 	 ion 	 	will	be	the	second	largest	cause	of	 dis 	 ability 	 	.
now	the	good	news	here	is	that	if	you	take	 survey 	 s 	 	from	around	the	world	,	we	see	that	about	three	 quarter 	 s 	 	of	people	will	say	they	are	at	 l 	 east 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	happy	.
but	 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	not	follow	any	of	the	usual	 trend 	 s 	 	.
for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	these	two	show	great	growth	in	income	,	 absolute 	 ly 	 	flat	happiness	 curv 	 es 	 	.
my	field	,	the	field	of	 psycho 	 logy 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 d 	 one 	 	a	whole	lot	to	help	us	move	forward	in	 understand 	 ing 	 	human	happiness	.
in	part	,	we	have	the	 leg 	 acy 	 	of	freud	,	who	was	a	 pessim 	 ist 	 	,	who	 s 	 aid 	 	that	 pur 	 suit 	 	of	happiness	is	a	 doom 	 ed 	 	quest	,	is	 propel 	 led 	 	by	 infant 	 ile 	 	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	of	the	individual	that	can	never	be	met	in	 re 	 ality 	 	.
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	one	 feel 	 s 	 	 inc 	 lined 	 	to	say	that	the	 intent 	 ion 	 	that	man	should	be	happy	is	not	 include 	 d 	 	in	the	plan	of	creation	.	``
so	the	ultimate	goal	of	 psycho 	 analytic 	 	 psycho 	 therapy 	 	was	 re 	 ally 	 	what	freud	 call 	 ed 	 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 mis 	 ery 	 	.
and	freud	in	part	 reflect 	 s 	 	the	anatomy	of	the	human	emotion	system	--	which	is	that	we	have	both	a	positive	and	a	negative	system	,	and	our	negative	system	is	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	sensitive	.
so	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	we	're	born	loving	the	taste	of	 some 	 thing 	 	sweet	and	 react 	 ing 	 	 aversive 	 ly 	 	to	the	taste	of	 some 	 thing 	 	bitter	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	find	that	people	are	more	 a 	 verse 	 	to	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	than	they	are	happy	to	gain	.
the	formula	for	a	happy	marriage	is	five	positive	 remark 	 s 	 	,	or	 interact 	 ions 	 	,	for	every	one	negative	.
and	that	's	how	 power 	 ful 	 	the	one	negative	is	.
 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 express 	 ions 	 	of	 con 	 tempt 	 	or	disgust	,	well	you	 re 	 ally 	 	need	a	lot	of	 positive 	 s 	 	to	 up 	 set 	 	that	.
i	 al 	 so 	 	put	in	here	the	stress	 respons 	 e 	 	.
we	're	wired	for	 danger 	 s 	 	that	are	 im 	 mediate 	 	,	that	are	physical	,	that	are	 im 	 min 	 ent 	 	,	and	so	our	body	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	an	 in 	 credible 	 	 re 	 action 	 	where	 endo 	 genous 	 	opioids	come	in	.
we	have	a	system	that	is	 re 	 ally 	 	ancient	,	and	 re 	 ally 	 	there	for	physical	danger	.
and	so	over	time	,	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	stress	 respons 	 e 	 	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	enormous	 effect 	 s 	 	on	the	body	.
 cort 	 isol 	 	 flood 	 s 	 	the	brain	;	it	 destroy 	 s 	 	 hippo 	 camp 	 al 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	and	 memor 	 y 	 	,	and	can	lead	to	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	health	 problem 	 s 	 	.
but	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	we	need	 th 	 is 	 	system	in	part	.
if	we	 we 	 re 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 govern 	 ed 	 	by	pleasure	we	would	not	 surviv 	 e 	 	.
we	 re 	 ally 	 	have	two	command	 post 	 s 	 	.
 emotion 	 s 	 	are	short	-	lived	 intens 	 e 	 	 respons 	 es 	 	to	 challeng 	 e 	 	and	to	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
and	each	one	of	them	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	click	 in 	 to 	 	alternate	 s 	 elves 	 	that	tune	in	,	turn	on	,	drop	out	 thought 	 s 	 	,	 per 	 ception 	 s 	 	,	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	 memor 	 ies 	 	.
we	tend	to	think	of	 emotion 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	just	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
but	in	fact	,	 emotion 	 s 	 	are	an	all	-	 system 	 s 	 	alert	that	change	what	we	remember	,	what	kind	of	 decision 	 s 	 	we	make	,	and	how	we	perceive	 thing 	 s 	 	.
so	let	me	go	forward	to	the	new	science	of	happiness	.
we	've	come	away	from	the	freudian	gloom	,	and	people	are	now	 active 	 ly 	 	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
and	one	of	the	key	 point 	 s 	 	in	the	science	of	happiness	is	that	happiness	and	 un 	 happiness 	 	are	not	 end 	 point 	 s 	 	of	a	single	 continu 	 um 	 	.
the	freudian	model	is	 re 	 ally 	 	one	 continu 	 um 	 	that	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	get	less	 mis 	 er 	 able 	 	,	you	get	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	.
and	that	is	n't	true	--	when	you	get	less	 mis 	 er 	 able 	 	,	you	get	less	 mis 	 er 	 able 	 	.
and	that	happiness	is	a	whole	other	end	of	the	 equ 	 ation 	 	.
and	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	.	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	from	 psycho 	 therapy 	 	.
so	when	people	's	 symptom 	 s 	 	go	away	,	they	tend	to	recur	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	is	n't	a	sense	of	the	other	half	--	of	what	pleasure	,	happiness	,	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	 grat 	 itude 	 	,	what	are	the	positive	 emotion 	 s 	 	.
and	of	course	we	know	 th 	 is 	 	 intuitive 	 ly 	 	,	that	happiness	is	not	just	the	 ab 	 s 	 ence 	 	of	 mis 	 ery 	 	.
but	 some 	 how 	 	it	was	not	put	forward	 un 	 til 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	 see 	 ing 	 	these	 a 	 s 	 	two	parallel	 system 	 s 	 	.
so	that	the	body	can	both	look	for	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	protect	 it 	 self 	 	from	danger	,	at	the	same	time	.
and	they	're	sort	of	two	 reciproc 	 al 	 	and	 dynamic 	 ally 	 	 interact 	 ing 	 	 system 	 s 	 	.
people	have	 al 	 so 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 de 	 construct 	 	.
we	use	 th 	 is 	 	word	``	happy	,	``	and	it	's	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	large	 um 	 br 	 ella 	 	of	a	term	.
and	then	three	 emotion 	 s 	 	for	which	there	are	no	english	 word 	 s 	 	:	 fi 	 ero 	 	,	which	is	the	 pri 	 de 	 	in	 accomplish 	 ment 	 	of	a	 challeng 	 e 	 	;	 sch 	 adenfreude 	 	,	which	is	happiness	in	 an 	 other 	 	's	 mis 	 fortune 	 	,	a	 m 	 alicious 	 	pleasure	;	and	 na 	 ches 	 	,	which	is	a	 pri 	 de 	 	and	joy	in	one	's	children	.
absent	from	 th 	 is 	 	list	,	and	absent	from	any	 discuss 	 ions 	 	of	happiness	,	are	happiness	in	 an 	 other 	 	's	happiness	.
we	do	n't	seem	to	have	a	word	for	that	.
we	are	 ver 	 y 	 	sensitive	to	the	negative	,	but	it	is	in	part	 off 	 set 	 	by	the	fact	that	we	have	a	 posit 	 ivity 	 	.
we	're	 al 	 so 	 	born	pleasure	-	 seek 	 ers 	 	.
 bab 	 ies 	 	love	the	taste	of	sweet	and	hate	the	taste	of	bitter	.
they	love	to	touch	smooth	 surface 	 s 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	rough	 one 	 s 	 	.
they	like	to	look	at	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 face 	 s 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	plain	 face 	 s 	 	.
they	like	to	listen	to	 con 	 son 	 ant 	 	 melo 	 dies 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 dis 	 son 	 ant 	 	 melo 	 dies 	 	.
 bab 	 ies 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	are	born	with	a	lot	of	innate	 pleasure 	 s 	 	.
there	was	once	a	 state 	 ment 	 	made	by	a	 psycho 	 logist 	 	that	 s 	 aid 	 	that	80	percent	of	the	 pur 	 suit 	 	of	happiness	is	 re 	 ally 	 	just	about	the	 gene 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	 a 	 s 	 	difficult	to	 be 	 come 	 	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	to	 be 	 come 	 	 tall 	 er 	 	.
that	's	 non 	 sense 	 	.
there	is	a	 de 	 cent 	 	 con 	 trib 	 ution 	 	to	happiness	from	the	 gene 	 s 	 	--	about	50	percent	--	but	there	is	still	that	50	percent	that	is	 un 	 account 	 ed 	 	for	.
let	's	just	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	brain	for	a	moment	,	and	see	where	 do 	 es 	 	happiness	arise	from	in	evolution	.
we	have	 bas 	 ically 	 	at	 l 	 east 	 	two	 system 	 s 	 	here	,	and	they	both	are	 ver 	 y 	 	ancient	.
one	is	the	reward	system	,	and	that	's	fed	by	the	chemical	dopamine	.
and	it	 start 	 s 	 	in	the	 vent 	 ral 	 	 teg 	 mental 	 	area	.
it	 go 	 es 	 	to	the	nucleus	 accu 	 mb 	 en 	 s 	 	,	all	the	way	up	to	the	 pre 	 frontal 	 	cortex	,	orbital	frontal	cortex	,	where	 decision 	 s 	 	are	made	,	high	level	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	 original 	 ly 	 	 s 	 een 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	system	that	was	the	pleasure	system	of	the	brain	.
in	the	1950s	,	olds	and	milner	put	 electro 	 de 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	brain	of	a	rat	.
and	the	rat	would	just	keep	 press 	 ing 	 	that	bar	 thousand 	 s 	 	and	 thousand 	 s 	 	and	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 time 	 s 	 	.
it	would	n't	eat	.	it	would	n't	sleep	.	it	would	n't	have	 s 	 ex 	 	.
it	would	n't	do	 any 	 thing 	 	but	press	 th 	 is 	 	bar	.
so	they	 assum 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	must	be	,	you	know	,	the	brain	's	 orgasm 	 atro 	 n 	 	.
it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	that	it	was	n't	,	that	it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	a	system	of	 motiv 	 ation 	 	,	a	system	of	 want 	 ing 	 	.
it	 give 	 s 	 	 object 	 s 	 	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	incentive	 s 	 ali 	 ence 	 	.
it	 make 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	look	so	 attract 	 ive 	 	that	you	just	have	to	go	after	it	.
that	's	 some 	 thing 	 	different	from	the	system	that	is	the	pleasure	system	,	which	 simpl 	 y 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	i	like	 th 	 is 	 	.	``
the	pleasure	system	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	see	,	which	is	the	internal	 opi 	 ates 	 	,	there	is	a	hormone	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	,	is	 wide 	 ly 	 	spread	 through 	 out 	 	the	brain	.
dopamine	system	,	the	 want 	 ing 	 	system	,	is	much	more	 central 	 ized 	 	.
the	other	thing	about	positive	 emotion 	 s 	 	is	that	they	have	a	universal	signal	.
and	we	see	here	the	 s 	 mile 	 	.
and	the	universal	signal	is	not	just	raising	the	corner	of	the	lips	to	the	 zygom 	 atic 	 	major	.
it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 crinkl 	 ing 	 	the	 out 	 er 	 	corner	of	the	eye	,	the	orbicularis	 oc 	 uli 	 	.
so	you	see	,	even	10	-	month	-	old	 bab 	 ies 	 	,	when	they	see	 the 	 ir 	 	mother	,	will	show	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	kind	of	 s 	 mile 	 	.
 extrovert 	 s 	 	use	it	more	than	 introvert 	 s 	 	.
people	who	are	 reliev 	 ed 	 	of	 depress 	 ion 	 	show	it	more	after	than	before	.
so	if	you	want	to	 un 	 mask 	 	a	true	look	of	happiness	,	you	will	look	for	 th 	 is 	 	 express 	 ion 	 	.
our	 pleasure 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	ancient	.
and	we	learn	,	of	course	,	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 pleasure 	 s 	 	,	but	 man 	 y 	 	of	them	are	base	.	and	one	of	them	,	of	course	,	is	 bio 	 philia 	 	--	that	we	have	a	 respons 	 e 	 	to	the	natural	world	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 pro 	 found 	 	.
 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	 d 	 one 	 	on	people	 re 	 cover 	 ing 	 	from	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	,	who	found	that	people	who	 face 	 d 	 	a	brick	wall	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	people	who	 look 	 ed 	 	out	on	 tree 	 s 	 	and	nature	,	the	people	who	 look 	 ed 	 	out	on	the	brick	wall	 we 	 re 	 	in	the	hospital	 long 	 er 	 	,	 need 	 ed 	 	more	 medic 	 ation 	 	,	and	had	more	medical	 complic 	 ations 	 	.
there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 resto 	 rative 	 	about	nature	,	and	it	's	part	of	how	we	are	tuned	.
 human 	 s 	 	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	so	,	we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 imit 	 ative 	 	 creature 	 s 	 	.
and	we	 imit 	 ate 	 	from	 al 	 most 	 	the	second	we	are	born	.
here	is	a	three	-	week	-	old	baby	.
and	if	you	stick	your	tongue	out	at	 th 	 is 	 	baby	,	the	baby	will	do	the	same	.
we	are	social	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	from	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
and	even	 stud 	 ies 	 	of	 co 	 operation 	 	show	that	 co 	 operation 	 	between	 individual 	 s 	 	 light 	 s 	 	up	reward	 center 	 s 	 	of	the	brain	.
one	problem	that	 psycho 	 logy 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	had	is	 in 	 stead 	 	of	looking	at	 th 	 is 	 	 inter 	 subject 	 ivity 	 	--	or	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	the	social	brain	to	 human 	 s 	 	who	come	 in 	 to 	 	the	world	 help 	 less 	 	and	need	each	other	 tremendous 	 ly 	 	--	is	that	they	focus	 in 	 stead 	 	on	the	self	and	self	-	esteem	,	and	not	self	-	other	.
it	's	sort	of	``	me	,	``	not	``	we	.	``
and	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	tremendous	problem	that	 go 	 es 	 	against	our	biology	and	nature	,	and	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	made	us	any	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	at	all	.
 be 	 cause 	 	when	you	think	about	it	,	people	are	 hap 	 pies 	 t 	 	when	in	flow	,	when	they	're	 absorb 	 ed 	 	in	 some 	 thing 	 	out	in	the	world	,	when	they	're	with	other	people	,	when	they	're	active	,	 engag 	 ed 	 	in	 s 	 port 	 s 	 	,	 focus 	 ing 	 	on	a	 love 	 d 	 	one	,	 learn 	 ing 	 	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	 s 	 ex 	 	,	 what 	 ever 	 	.
they	're	not	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	front	of	the	mirror	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	out	,	or	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
these	are	not	the	 period 	 s 	 	when	you	feel	 hap 	 pies 	 t 	 	.
the	other	thing	is	,	that	a	piece	of	evidence	is	,	is	if	you	look	at	 computer 	 ized 	 	text	analysis	of	people	who	commit	 su 	 icide 	 	,	what	you	find	there	,	and	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	is	use	of	the	first	person	 s 	 ing 	 ular 	 	--	``	i	,	``	``	me	,	``	``	my	,	``	not	``	we	``	and	``	us	``	--	and	the	 letter 	 s 	 	are	less	 hope 	 less 	 	than	they	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 al 	 one 	 	.
and	 be 	 ing 	 	 al 	 one 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 natural 	 	to	the	human	.
there	is	a	 pro 	 found 	 	need	to	belong	.
but	there	are	ways	in	which	our	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	can	 re 	 ally 	 	trip	us	up	.
 be 	 cause 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	the	 gene 	 s 	 	do	n't	care	 whet 	 her 	 	we	're	happy	,	they	care	that	we	replicate	,	that	we	pass	our	 gene 	 s 	 	on	.
so	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	we	have	three	 system 	 s 	 	that	 under 	 lie 	 	 re 	 production 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	so	 import 	 ant 	 	.
there	's	lust	,	which	is	just	 want 	 ing 	 	to	have	 s 	 ex 	 	.
and	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 mediate 	 d 	 	by	the	 s 	 ex 	 	 hormone 	 s 	 	.
romantic	 attract 	 ion 	 	,	that	 get 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 desir 	 e 	 	system	.
and	that	's	dopamine	-	fed	.	and	that	's	,	``	i	must	have	 th 	 is 	 	one	person	.	``
there	's	 attach 	 ment 	 	,	which	is	 oxy 	 tocin 	 	,	and	the	 opi 	 ates 	 	,	which	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	long	-	term	bond	.	``
see	the	problem	is	that	,	 a 	 s 	 	 human 	 s 	 	,	these	three	can	 separat 	 e 	 	.
so	a	person	can	be	in	a	long	term	 attach 	 ment 	 	,	 be 	 come 	 	 romantic 	 ally 	 	 infatu 	 ated 	 	with	 some 	 one 	 	else	,	and	want	to	have	 s 	 ex 	 	with	a	third	person	.
the	other	way	in	which	our	 gene 	 s 	 	can	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	lead	us	 ast 	 ray 	 	is	in	social	 stat 	 us 	 	.
we	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 a 	 cute 	 ly 	 	aware	of	our	social	 stat 	 us 	 	and	 al 	 ways 	 	seek	to	further	and	 in 	 crease 	 	it	.
now	in	the	animal	world	,	there	is	 on 	 ly 	 	one	way	to	 in 	 crease 	 	 stat 	 us 	 	,	and	that	's	 domin 	 ance 	 	.
i	 s 	 e 	 ize 	 	command	by	physical	 pro 	 we 	 s 	 s 	 	,	and	i	keep	it	by	 beat 	 ing 	 	my	chest	,	and	you	make	 sub 	 mis 	 s 	 ive 	 	 gest 	 ures 	 	.
now	,	the	human	 ha 	 s 	 	a	whole	other	way	to	rise	to	the	top	,	and	that	is	a	 pre 	 stig 	 e 	 	route	,	which	is	 free 	 ly 	 	 confer 	 red 	 	.
 some 	 one 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 expert 	 ise 	 	and	knowledge	,	and	 know 	 s 	 	how	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	we	give	that	person	 stat 	 us 	 	.
and	that	's	 clear 	 ly 	 	the	way	for	us	to	create	 man 	 y 	 	more	 niche 	 s 	 	of	 stat 	 us 	 	so	that	people	do	n't	have	to	be	lower	on	the	 stat 	 us 	 	 hierarch 	 y 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	are	in	the	animal	world	.
the	data	is	n't	 terr 	 ibly 	 	 support 	 ive 	 	of	money	 buy 	 ing 	 	happiness	.
but	it	's	not	 ir 	 relevant 	 	.
so	if	you	look	at	 question 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	life	satisfaction	,	you	see	life	satisfaction	going	up	with	each	rung	of	income	.
you	see	mental	 di 	 stress 	 	going	up	with	lower	income	.
so	 clear 	 ly 	 	there	is	some	effect	.
but	the	effect	is	 relat 	 ively 	 	small	.
and	one	of	the	 problem 	 s 	 	with	money	is	 material 	 ism 	 	.
what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	people	pursue	money	too	 avid 	 ly 	 	,	is	they	forget	about	the	real	 bas 	 ic 	 	 pleasure 	 s 	 	of	life	.
so	we	have	here	,	 th 	 is 	 	couple	.
``	do	you	think	the	less	-	fortunate	are	 hav 	 ing 	 	better	 s 	 ex 	 	?	``
and	then	 th 	 is 	 	kid	over	here	is	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	 leav 	 e 	 	me	 al 	 one 	 	with	my	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	.	``
so	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	is	that	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 take 	 s 	 	over	.
that	whole	dopamine	-	 want 	 ing 	 	system	 take 	 s 	 	over	and	 de 	 rail 	 s 	 	from	any	of	the	pleasure	system	.
maslow	had	 th 	 is 	 	idea	back	in	the	1950s	that	 a 	 s 	 	people	rise	above	 the 	 ir 	 	 bio 	 logical 	 	 need 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	world	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 safe 	 r 	 	and	we	do	n't	have	to	worry	about	 bas 	 ic 	 	 need 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	met	--	our	 bio 	 logical 	 	system	,	 what 	 ever 	 	 motiv 	 ates 	 	us	,	is	 be 	 ing 	 	satisfied	--	we	can	rise	above	them	,	to	think	beyond	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	self	-	actualization	or	 transcend 	 ence 	 	,	and	rise	above	the	 material 	 ist 	 	.
so	to	just	 quick 	 ly 	 	conclude	with	some	brief	data	that	 suggest 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	might	be	so	.
one	is	people	who	 under 	 went 	 	what	is	 call 	 ed 	 	a	 quant 	 um 	 	change	:	they	felt	 the 	 ir 	 	life	and	 the 	 ir 	 	whole	 value 	 s 	 	had	 change 	 d 	 	.
and	 s 	 ure 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	if	you	look	at	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 value 	 s 	 	that	come	in	,	you	see	wealth	,	adventure	,	 achiev 	 ement 	 	,	pleasure	,	 f 	 un 	 	,	be	 respect 	 ed 	 	,	before	the	change	,	and	much	more	post	-	 material 	 ist 	 	 value 	 s 	 	after	.
women	had	a	whole	different	set	of	value	 shift 	 s 	 	.
but	 ver 	 y 	 	 similar 	 ly 	 	,	the	 on 	 ly 	 	one	that	 surviv 	 ed 	 	there	was	happiness	.
they	went	from	 attract 	 ive 	 ness 	 	and	happiness	and	wealth	and	self	-	control	to	 gene 	 ros 	 ity 	 	and	 forgive 	 ness 	 	.
i	end	with	a	few	 quote 	 s 	 	.
``	there	is	 on 	 ly 	 	one	question	:	how	to	love	 th 	 is 	 	world	?	``
and	rilke	,	``	if	your	 dai 	 ly 	 	life	 seem 	 s 	 	poor	,	do	not	blame	it	;	blame	 your 	 self 	 	.
tell	 your 	 self 	 	that	you	are	not	poet	 en 	 ough 	 	to	call	forth	 it 	 s 	 	 rich 	 es 	 	.	``
``	first	,	say	to	 your 	 self 	 	what	you	would	be	.
then	do	what	you	have	to	do	.	``
thank	you	.
