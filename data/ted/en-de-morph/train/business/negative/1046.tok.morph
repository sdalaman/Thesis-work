so	i	am	a	surgeon	who	 stud 	 ies 	 	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	,	and	i	have	never	had	a	patient	tell	me	that	``	i	 re 	 ally 	 	want	you	to	be	creative	 dur 	 ing 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	,	``	and	so	i	guess	there	's	a	little	bit	of	 iron 	 y 	 	to	it	.
i	will	say	 th 	 ough 	 	that	,	after	 hav 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	a	lot	,	it	's	 some 	 what 	 	similar	to	 play 	 ing 	 	a	musical	instrument	.
and	for	me	,	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	deep	and	 endur 	 ing 	 	 fasci 	 nation 	 	with	sound	is	what	led	me	to	both	be	a	surgeon	and	 al 	 so 	 	to	 stud 	 y 	 	the	science	of	sound	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	music	.
and	so	i	'm	going	to	try	to	talk	to	you	over	the	next	few	 minute 	 s 	 	about	my	 care 	 er 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	how	i	'm	able	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	try	to	 stud 	 y 	 	music	and	 re 	 ally 	 	try	to	 grappl 	 e 	 	with	all	these	 question 	 s 	 	of	how	the	brain	is	able	to	be	creative	.
i	've	 d 	 one 	 	most	of	 th 	 is 	 	work	at	johns	hopkins	university	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	at	the	national	institute	of	health	where	i	was	 previous 	 ly 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	go	over	some	science	 experiment 	 s 	 	and	try	to	cover	three	musical	 experiment 	 s 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	start	off	by	 play 	 ing 	 	a	video	for	you	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	video	is	a	video	of	keith	jarrett	,	who	's	a	well	-	known	jazz	 improv 	 is 	 er 	 	and	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	most	well	-	known	,	 icon 	 ic 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 some 	 one 	 	who	 take 	 s 	 	improvisation	to	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 high 	 er 	 	level	.
and	he	'll	 improv 	 ise 	 	entire	 concert 	 s 	 	off	the	top	of	his	head	,	and	he	'll	never	play	it	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	way	 aga 	 in 	 	,	and	so	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	form	of	 intens 	 e 	 	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	,	i	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	great	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
and	so	why	do	n't	we	go	and	click	the	video	.
it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	a	 remark 	 able 	 	,	awesome	thing	that	 happen 	 s 	 	there	.
i	've	 al 	 ways 	 	--	just	 a 	 s 	 	a	 listen 	 er 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	just	a	fan	--	i	listen	to	that	,	and	i	'm	just	 astound 	 ed 	 	.
i	think	--	how	can	 th 	 is 	 	possibly	be	?
how	can	the	brain	generate	that	much	information	,	that	much	music	,	 spontane 	 ously 	 	?
and	so	i	set	out	with	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 cept 	 	,	 scientific 	 ally 	 	,	that	 art 	 istic 	 	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	,	it	's	 magic 	 al 	 	,	but	it	's	not	magic	,	meaning	that	it	's	a	product	of	the	brain	.
there	's	not	too	 man 	 y 	 	brain	-	dead	people	creating	art	.
and	so	with	 th 	 is 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	that	 art 	 istic 	 	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	is	in	fact	a	 neuro 	 logic 	 	product	,	i	took	 th 	 is 	 	thesis	that	we	could	 stud 	 y 	 	it	just	like	we	 stud 	 y 	 	any	other	complex	 neuro 	 logic 	 	process	.
and	i	think	there	's	some	sub	-	 question 	 s 	 	there	that	i	put	there	.
is	it	 tru 	 ly 	 	possible	to	 stud 	 y 	 	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	 scientific 	 ally 	 	?
and	i	think	that	's	a	good	question	.
and	i	'll	tell	you	that	most	scientific	 stud 	 ies 	 	of	music	,	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	dense	,	and	when	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	go	through	them	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	the	music	in	it	.
in	fact	,	they	seem	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 musical 	 	 entire 	 ly 	 	and	to	 mis 	 s 	 	the	whole	point	of	the	music	.
and	so	it	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	the	second	question	:	why	should	 scientist 	 s 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	?
 may 	 be 	 	we	're	not	the	right	people	to	do	it	.
well	it	may	be	,	but	i	will	say	that	,	from	a	scientific	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	--	we	 talk 	 ed 	 	a	lot	about	 innov 	 ation 	 	 to 	 day 	 	--	the	science	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	how	much	we	understand	about	how	the	brain	is	able	to	 innov 	 ate 	 	is	in	 it 	 s 	 	 inf 	 ancy 	 	,	and	 tru 	 ly 	 	,	we	know	 ver 	 y 	 	little	about	how	we	are	able	to	be	creative	.
and	so	i	think	that	we	're	going	to	see	over	the	next	10	,	20	,	30	 year 	 s 	 	a	real	science	of	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	that	's	 burg 	 eon 	 ing 	 	and	is	going	to	flourish	.
 be 	 cause 	 	we	now	have	new	 method 	 s 	 	that	can	 en 	 able 	 	us	to	take	 th 	 is 	 	process	of	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	complex	jazz	improvisation	,	and	 stud 	 y 	 	it	 rigor 	 ously 	 	.
and	so	it	 get 	 s 	 	down	to	the	brain	.
and	so	all	of	us	have	 th 	 is 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	brain	,	which	is	 poor 	 ly 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	to	say	the	 l 	 east 	 	.
i	think	that	 neuro 	 scientist 	 s 	 	have	 man 	 y 	 	more	 question 	 s 	 	than	 answer 	 s 	 	,	and	i	 my 	 self 	 	,	i	'm	not	going	to	give	you	 man 	 y 	 	 answer 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	just	ask	a	lot	of	 question 	 s 	 	.
and	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	that	's	what	i	do	in	my	lab	.
i	ask	 question 	 s 	 	about	what	is	 th 	 is 	 	brain	 do 	 ing 	 	to	 en 	 able 	 	us	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	main	method	that	i	use	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	functional	mri	.
if	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	in	an	mri	scanner	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	much	the	same	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	one	is	 out 	 fitted 	 	in	a	special	way	to	not	just	take	 picture 	 s 	 	of	your	brain	,	but	to	 al 	 so 	 	take	 picture 	 s 	 	of	active	 area 	 s 	 	of	the	brain	.
now	the	way	that	's	 d 	 one 	 	is	by	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	.
there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	bold	 im 	 aging 	 	,	which	is	blood	oxygen	level	dependent	 im 	 aging 	 	.
now	when	you	're	in	an	fmri	scanner	,	you	're	in	a	big	magnet	that	's	 align 	 ing 	 	your	 molecule 	 s 	 	in	certain	 area 	 s 	 	.
when	an	area	of	the	brain	is	active	,	meaning	a	neural	area	is	active	,	it	 get 	 s 	 	blood	flow	 s 	 hunt 	 ed 	 	to	that	area	.
that	blood	flow	 cause 	 s 	 	an	 in 	 crease 	 	in	local	blood	to	that	area	with	a	 de 	 oxy 	 hemoglobin 	 	change	in	 concent 	 ration 	 	.
 de 	 oxy 	 hemoglobin 	 	can	be	 detect 	 ed 	 	by	mri	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	 oxy 	 hemoglobin 	 	ca	n't	.
so	through	 th 	 is 	 	method	of	 in 	 ference 	 	--	and	we	're	 measur 	 ing 	 	blood	flow	,	not	neural	activity	--	we	say	that	an	area	of	the	brain	that	's	 get 	 ting 	 	more	blood	was	active	 dur 	 ing 	 	a	 part 	 icular 	 	task	,	and	that	's	the	crux	of	how	fmri	 work 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	used	since	the	'90s	to	 stud 	 y 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	complex	 process 	 es 	 	.
now	i	'm	going	to	review	a	 stud 	 y 	 	that	i	did	,	which	was	jazz	in	an	fmri	scanner	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	was	 d 	 one 	 	with	a	 col 	 league 	 	of	mine	,	alan	braun	,	at	the	nih	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	short	video	of	how	we	did	 th 	 is 	 	project	.
charles	limb	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	plastic	midi	piano	 key 	 board 	 	that	we	use	for	the	jazz	 experiment 	 s 	 	.
and	it	's	a	35	-	key	 key 	 board 	 	that	is	designed	to	fit	both	 in 	 side 	 	the	scanner	,	be	 magnet 	 ically 	 	safe	,	have	minimal	 inter 	 ference 	 	that	would	 con 	 tribute 	 	to	any	artifact	and	have	 th 	 is 	 	cushion	so	that	it	can	rest	on	the	 player 	 s 	 	'	 leg 	 s 	 	while	they	're	 ly 	 ing 	 	down	in	the	scanner	,	 play 	 ing 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	back	.
and	it	 work 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	produce	any	sound	.
it	 s 	 end 	 s 	 	out	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	a	midi	signal	--	or	a	musical	instrument	digital	 inter 	 face 	 	--	through	these	 wire 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	box	and	then	the	computer	,	which	then	trigger	high	-	quality	piano	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
cl	:	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	so	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
and	so	through	 th 	 is 	 	piano	 key 	 board 	 	,	we	now	have	the	 mean 	 s 	 	to	take	a	musical	process	and	 stud 	 y 	 	it	.
so	what	do	you	do	now	that	you	have	 th 	 is 	 	cool	piano	 key 	 board 	 	?
you	ca	n't	just	sort	of	--	``	it	's	great	we	've	got	 th 	 is 	 	 key 	 board 	 	.	``
we	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	to	come	up	with	a	scientific	experiment	.
and	so	the	experiment	 re 	 ally 	 	 rest 	 s 	 	on	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	:	what	 happen 	 s 	 	in	the	brain	 dur 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	 memor 	 ized 	 	and	over	-	 learn 	 ed 	 	,	and	what	 happen 	 s 	 	in	the	brain	 dur 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	 spontane 	 ously 	 	generated	,	or	 improv 	 is 	 ed 	 	,	in	a	way	that	's	 match 	 ed 	 	 motor 	 ically 	 	and	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	lower	-	level	 sensor 	 y 	 	motor	 feature 	 s 	 	?
and	so	,	i	have	here	what	we	call	the	``	 paradigm 	 s 	 	.	``
there	's	a	scale	paradigm	,	which	is	just	 play 	 ing 	 	a	scale	up	and	down	,	 memor 	 ized 	 	.
and	then	there	's	 improv 	 is 	 ing 	 	on	a	scale	--	quarter	 note 	 s 	 	,	metronome	,	right	hand	--	 scientific 	 ally 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	safe	,	but	 musical 	 ly 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 bor 	 ing 	 	.
and	then	there	's	the	bottom	one	,	which	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	jazz	paradigm	.
and	so	what	we	did	was	we	 br 	 ought 	 	professional	jazz	 player 	 s 	 	to	the	nih	,	and	we	had	them	 memor 	 ize 	 	 th 	 is 	 	piece	of	music	on	the	left	,	the	lower	-	left	--	which	is	what	you	heard	me	 play 	 ing 	 	--	and	then	we	had	them	 improv 	 ise 	 	to	the	same	exact	 chor 	 d 	 	 change 	 s 	 	.
and	if	you	can	hit	that	lower	-	right	sound	icon	,	that	's	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	what	was	 record 	 ed 	 	in	the	scanner	.
so	in	the	end	,	it	's	not	the	most	natural	environment	,	but	they	're	able	to	play	real	music	.
and	i	've	 listen 	 ed 	 	to	that	 s 	 olo 	 	200	 time 	 s 	 	,	and	i	still	like	it	.
and	the	 music 	 ians 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 comfort 	 able 	 	in	the	end	.
and	so	we	first	 measur 	 ed 	 	the	number	of	 note 	 s 	 	.
 we 	 re 	 	they	in	fact	just	 play 	 ing 	 	a	lot	more	 note 	 s 	 	when	they	 we 	 re 	 	 improv 	 is 	 ing 	 	?
that	was	not	what	was	going	on	.
and	then	we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	brain	activity	.
i	'm	going	to	try	to	 condens 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	for	you	.
these	are	contrast	 map 	 s 	 	that	are	 show 	 ing 	 	 subtract 	 ions 	 	between	what	 change 	 s 	 	when	you	're	 improv 	 is 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	when	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 memor 	 ized 	 	.
in	red	is	an	area	that	active	in	the	 pre 	 frontal 	 	cortex	,	the	frontal	lobe	of	the	brain	,	and	in	blue	is	 th 	 is 	 	area	that	was	 de 	 activate 	 d 	 	.
and	so	we	had	 th 	 is 	 	 f 	 oc 	 al 	 	area	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 media 	 l 	 	 pre 	 frontal 	 	cortex	that	went	way	up	in	activity	.
we	had	 th 	 is 	 	broad	patch	of	area	 call 	 ed 	 	the	lateral	 pre 	 frontal 	 	cortex	that	went	way	down	in	activity	,	and	i	'll	summarize	that	for	you	here	.
now	these	are	 multi 	 functional 	 	 area 	 s 	 	of	the	brain	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	like	to	say	,	these	are	not	the	``	jazz	 area 	 s 	 	``	of	the	brain	.
they	do	a	whole	host	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	have	to	do	with	self	-	 reflect 	 ion 	 	,	 intro 	 spect 	 ion 	 	,	 work 	 ing 	 	 memor 	 y 	 	and	so	forth	.
 re 	 ally 	 	,	 conscious 	 ness 	 	is	 seat 	 ed 	 	in	the	frontal	lobe	.
but	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	combination	of	an	area	that	's	thought	to	be	 involve 	 d 	 	in	self	-	 monitor 	 ing 	 	,	 turn 	 ing 	 	off	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	area	that	's	thought	to	be	 auto 	 bio 	 graphical 	 	,	or	self	-	 express 	 ive 	 	,	 turn 	 ing 	 	on	.
and	we	think	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 pre 	 liminary 	 	--	it	's	one	 stud 	 y 	 	;	it	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	wrong	,	but	it	's	one	 stud 	 y 	 	--	we	think	that	at	 l 	 east 	 	a	 reason 	 able 	 	 hypo 	 thesis 	 	is	that	,	to	be	creative	,	you	have	to	have	 th 	 is 	 	weird	 dis 	 soci 	 ation 	 	in	your	frontal	lobe	.
one	area	 turn 	 s 	 	on	,	and	a	big	area	 shut 	 s 	 	off	,	so	that	you	're	not	 inhibit 	 ed 	 	,	so	that	you	're	 will 	 ing 	 	to	make	 mistak 	 es 	 	,	so	that	you	're	not	 constant 	 ly 	 	 shut 	 ting 	 	down	all	of	these	new	generative	 impulse 	 s 	 	.
now	a	lot	of	people	know	that	music	is	not	 al 	 ways 	 	a	 s 	 olo 	 	activity	--	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	it	's	 d 	 one 	 	 communicative 	 ly 	 	.
and	so	the	next	question	was	:	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	 music 	 ians 	 	are	 tra 	 d 	 ing 	 	back	and	forth	,	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 tra 	 d 	 ing 	 	 four 	 s 	 	,	``	which	is	 some 	 thing 	 	they	do	 normal 	 ly 	 	in	a	jazz	experiment	?
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	twelve	-	bar	 blue 	 s 	 	.
and	i	've	broken	it	down	 in 	 to 	 	four	-	bar	 group 	 s 	 	here	,	so	you	would	know	how	you	would	trade	.
now	what	we	did	was	we	 br 	 ought 	 	a	 music 	 ian 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	scanner	--	same	way	--	had	them	 memor 	 ize 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 melo 	 dy 	 	and	then	had	 an 	 other 	 	 music 	 ian 	 	out	in	the	control	room	 tra 	 d 	 ing 	 	back	and	forth	 interact 	 ively 	 	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 music 	 ian 	 	,	 mi 	 ke 	 	 pop 	 e 	 	,	one	of	the	world	's	best	 bas 	 s 	 ists 	 	and	a	fantastic	piano	player	.
so	he	's	now	 play 	 ing 	 	the	piece	that	we	just	saw	just	a	little	better	than	i	wrote	it	.
cl	:	 mi 	 ke 	 	,	come	on	in	.	 mi 	 ke 	 	 pop 	 e 	 	:	may	the	force	be	with	you	.
nurse	:	 noth 	 ing 	 	's	in	your	 pocket 	 s 	 	,	right	 mi 	 ke 	 	?
mp	:	nope	.	 noth 	 ing 	 	's	in	my	 pocket 	 s 	 	.	nurse	:	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
cl	:	you	have	to	have	the	right	attitude	to	agree	to	it	.
it	's	kind	of	 f 	 un 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
and	so	now	we	're	 play 	 ing 	 	back	and	forth	.
he	's	in	there	.	you	can	see	his	 leg 	 s 	 	up	there	.
and	then	i	'm	in	the	control	room	here	,	 play 	 ing 	 	back	and	forth	.
 mi 	 ke 	 	 pop 	 e 	 	:	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	 represent 	 ation 	 	of	what	it	's	like	.
and	it	's	good	that	it	's	not	too	quick	.
the	fact	that	we	do	it	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	lets	you	 acclim 	 ate 	 	to	your	 surround 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
so	the	 hard 	 est 	 	thing	for	me	was	the	kinesthetic	thing	,	of	looking	at	my	 hand 	 s 	 	through	two	 mirror 	 s 	 	,	 lay 	 ing 	 	on	my	back	and	not	able	to	move	at	all	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	my	hand	.
that	was	 challeng 	 ing 	 	.
but	 aga 	 in 	 	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	 moment 	 s 	 	,	for	 s 	 ure 	 	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	 moment 	 s 	 	of	real	,	honest	-	to	-	god	musical	 inter 	 play 	 	,	for	 s 	 ure 	 	.
cl	:	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	i	'll	take	a	few	 moment 	 s 	 	.
and	so	what	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	here	--	and	i	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	a	 card 	 in 	 al 	 	 s 	 in 	 	in	science	,	which	is	to	show	you	 pre 	 liminary 	 	data	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	subject	's	data	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	,	in	fact	,	 mi 	 ke 	 	 pop 	 e 	 	's	data	.
so	what	am	i	 show 	 ing 	 	you	here	?
when	he	was	 tra 	 d 	 ing 	 	 four 	 s 	 	with	me	,	 improv 	 is 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	 memor 	 ized 	 	,	his	language	 area 	 s 	 	lit	up	,	his	broca	's	area	,	which	is	 infer 	 ior 	 	frontal	 gy 	 rus 	 	on	the	left	.
he	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	it	 al 	 so 	 	 homo 	 log 	 ous 	 	on	the	right	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	an	area	thought	to	be	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 express 	 ive 	 	communication	.
 th 	 is 	 	whole	 not 	 ion 	 	that	music	is	a	language	--	well	 may 	 be 	 	there	's	a	 neuro 	 logic 	 	 bas 	 is 	 	to	it	in	fact	after	all	,	and	we	can	see	it	when	two	 music 	 ians 	 	are	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	musical	conversation	.
and	so	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	on	eight	 subject 	 s 	 	now	,	and	we	're	just	 get 	 ting 	 	all	the	data	together	,	so	 hope 	 fully 	 	we	'll	have	 some 	 thing 	 	to	say	about	it	 meaning 	 fully 	 	.
now	when	i	think	about	improvisation	and	the	language	,	well	what	's	next	?
rap	,	of	course	,	rap	--	free	-	style	.
and	so	i	've	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 fascinate 	 d 	 	by	free	-	style	.
and	let	's	go	 a 	 head 	 	and	play	 th 	 is 	 	video	here	.
mos	def	:	♫	...	 brow 	 n 	 	skin	i	be	,	 stand 	 ing 	 	five	-	ten	i	be	♫	♫	 rock 	 in 	 	'	it	when	i	be	,	in	your	 vic 	 in 	 ity 	 	♫	♫	whole	-	style	 syn 	 er 	 gy 	 	,	 recogn 	 ize 	 	symmetry	♫	♫	go	and	try	to	 inju 	 re 	 	me	,	broke	'	em	down	 chemical 	 ly 	 	♫	♫	ai	n't	the	number	10	mc	,	talk	about	how	 be 	 en 	 	i	be	♫	♫	 styl 	 ed 	 	it	like	kennedy	,	late	like	a	10	to	three	♫	♫	when	i	say	when	i	be	,	 girl 	 s 	 	say	bend	that	key	cut	♫	cl	:	and	so	there	's	a	lot	of	 analog 	 y 	 	between	what	 take 	 s 	 	place	in	free	-	style	rap	and	jazz	.
there	are	,	in	fact	,	a	lot	of	 correlation 	 s 	 	between	the	two	 form 	 s 	 	of	music	i	think	in	different	time	 period 	 s 	 	.
in	a	lot	a	ways	,	rap	 serve 	 s 	 	the	same	social	function	that	jazz	used	to	serve	.
so	how	do	you	 stud 	 y 	 	rap	 scientific 	 ally 	 	?
and	my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	kind	of	think	i	'm	crazy	,	but	i	think	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 vi 	 able 	 	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	you	do	:	you	have	a	free	-	style	artist	come	in	and	 memor 	 ize 	 	a	rap	that	you	write	for	them	,	that	they	've	never	heard	before	,	and	then	you	have	them	free	-	style	.
so	i	told	my	lab	 member 	 s 	 	that	i	would	rap	for	ted	,	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	no	,	you	wo	n't	.	``
and	then	i	thought	--	but	here	's	the	thing	.
with	 th 	 is 	 	big	screen	,	you	can	all	rap	with	me	.	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
so	what	we	had	them	do	was	 memor 	 ize 	 	 th 	 is 	 	lower	-	left	sound	icon	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	control	condition	.	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	they	 memor 	 ized 	 	.
computer	:	♫	 memor 	 y 	 	,	thump	.	♫	cl	:	♫	thump	of	the	beat	in	a	known	repeat	♫	♫	rhythm	and	 rhym 	 e 	 	,	they	make	me	complete	♫	♫	the	climb	is	 sub 	 lime 	 	when	i	'm	on	the	mic	♫	♫	spittin	'	 rhym 	 es 	 	that	hit	you	like	a	 light 	 ning 	 	strike	♫	♫	i	search	for	the	truth	in	 th 	 is 	 	 e 	 ternal 	 	quest	♫	♫	my	 pass 	 ion 	 	's	not	fashion	,	you	can	see	how	i	'm	 dress 	 ed 	 	♫	♫	 psychopath 	 ic 	 	 word 	 s 	 	in	my	head	appear	♫	♫	whisper	these	 lyric 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	i	can	hear	♫	♫	the	art	of	 discover 	 ing 	 	and	that	which	is	 hover 	 ing 	 	♫	♫	 in 	 side 	 	the	mind	of	 t 	 hose 	 	unconfined	♫	♫	all	of	these	 word 	 s 	 	keep	 pour 	 ing 	 	out	like	rain	♫	♫	i	need	a	mad	scientist	to	check	my	brain	♫	i	guarantee	you	that	will	never	happen	 aga 	 in 	 	.
so	now	,	what	's	great	about	these	free	-	stylers	,	they	will	get	 cu 	 ed 	 	different	 word 	 s 	 	.
they	do	n't	know	what	's	coming	,	but	they	'll	hear	 some 	 thing 	 	off	the	cuff	.
go	 a 	 head 	 	and	hit	that	right	sound	icon	.
they	are	going	to	be	 cu 	 ed 	 	these	three	square	 word 	 s 	 	:	``	like	,	``	``	not	``	and	``	head	.	``
he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	know	what	's	coming	.

it	's	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	,	 neuro 	 logically 	 	,	is	 remark 	 able 	 	.
 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	you	like	the	music	is	 ir 	 relevant 	 	.
 creative 	 ly 	 	 s 	 peaking 	 	,	it	's	just	a	 phenomen 	 al 	 	thing	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	a	short	video	of	how	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	 th 	 is 	 	in	a	scanner	.
cl	:	we	're	here	with	emmanuel	.
cl	:	that	was	 record 	 ed 	 	in	the	scanner	,	by	the	way	.
cl	:	that	's	emmanuel	in	the	scanner	.
he	's	just	 memor 	 ized 	 	a	 rhym 	 e 	 	for	us	.
emmanuel	:	♫	top	of	the	beat	with	no	repeat	♫	♫	rhythm	and	 rhym 	 e 	 	make	me	complete	♫	♫	climb	is	 sub 	 lime 	 	when	i	'm	on	the	mic	♫	♫	spittin	'	 rhym 	 es 	 	that	'll	hit	you	like	a	 light 	 ning 	 	strike	♫	♫	i	search	for	the	truth	in	 th 	 is 	 	 e 	 ternal 	 	quest	♫	♫	i	'm	 pass 	 ing 	 	on	fashion	;	you	can	see	how	i	'm	 dress 	 ed 	 	♫	cl	:	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.	so	i	'm	going	to	stop	that	there	.	so	what	do	we	see	in	his	brain	?
well	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	four	 ra 	 ppers 	 	'	 brain 	 s 	 	.
and	what	we	see	,	we	do	see	language	 area 	 s 	 	 light 	 ing 	 	up	,	but	then	--	 eye 	 s 	 	closed	--	when	you	are	free	-	 styl 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	 memor 	 izing 	 	,	you	've	got	major	visual	 area 	 s 	 	 light 	 ing 	 	up	.
you	've	got	major	 ce 	 rebel 	 lar 	 	activity	,	which	is	 involve 	 d 	 	in	motor	 coordi 	 nation 	 	.
you	have	 height 	 ened 	 	brain	activity	when	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	a	 compar 	 able 	 	task	,	when	that	one	task	is	creative	and	the	other	task	is	 memor 	 ized 	 	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 pre 	 liminary 	 	,	but	i	think	it	's	kind	of	cool	.
so	just	to	conclude	,	we	've	got	a	lot	of	 question 	 s 	 	to	ask	,	and	like	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	we	'll	ask	 question 	 s 	 	here	,	not	answer	them	.
but	we	want	to	get	at	the	root	of	what	is	creative	 gen 	 ius 	 	,	 neuro 	 logically 	 	,	and	i	think	,	with	these	 method 	 s 	 	,	we	're	 get 	 ting 	 	close	to	 be 	 ing 	 	there	.
and	i	think	 hope 	 fully 	 	in	the	next	10	,	20	 year 	 s 	 	you	'll	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	real	,	 meaning 	 ful 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	that	say	science	 ha 	 s 	 	to	catch	up	to	art	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	we	're	 start 	 ing 	 	now	to	get	there	.
and	so	i	want	to	thank	you	for	your	time	.	i	appreciate	it	.
