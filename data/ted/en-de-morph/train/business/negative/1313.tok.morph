there	have	 be 	 en 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 revolution 	 s 	 	over	the	last	century	,	but	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 non 	 e 	 	 a 	 s 	 	significant	 a 	 s 	 	the	 long 	 ev 	 ity 	 	revolution	.
we	are	living	on	average	 to 	 day 	 	34	 year 	 s 	 	 long 	 er 	 	than	our	great	-	 grand 	 parent 	 s 	 	did	.
think	about	that	.
that	's	an	entire	second	adult	 life 	 time 	 	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	 add 	 ed 	 	to	our	 life 	 span 	 	.
and	yet	,	for	the	most	part	,	our	culture	 ha 	 s 	 	not	come	to	 term 	 s 	 	with	what	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	.
we	're	still	living	with	the	old	paradigm	of	age	 a 	 s 	 	an	arch	.
that	's	the	metaphor	,	the	old	metaphor	.
you	're	born	,	you	peak	at	 mid 	 life 	 	and	decline	 in 	 to 	 	 decr 	 ep 	 itude 	 	.
age	 a 	 s 	 	 path 	 ology 	 	.
but	 man 	 y 	 	people	 to 	 day 	 	--	 philosoph 	 ers 	 	,	 artist 	 s 	 	,	 doctor 	 s 	 	,	 scientist 	 s 	 	--	are	taking	a	new	look	at	what	i	call	the	third	act	,	the	last	three	 decade 	 s 	 	of	life	.
they	 real 	 ize 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 develop 	 mental 	 	stage	of	life	with	 it 	 s 	 	own	 sign 	 ific 	 ance 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	different	from	 mid 	 life 	 	 a 	 s 	 	adolescence	is	from	 child 	 hood 	 	.
and	they	are	 ask 	 ing 	 	--	we	should	all	be	 ask 	 ing 	 	--	how	do	we	use	 th 	 is 	 	time	?
how	do	we	live	it	 success 	 fully 	 	?
what	is	the	appropriate	new	metaphor	for	aging	?
i	've	 s 	 pent 	 	the	last	year	 research 	 ing 	 	and	writing	about	 th 	 is 	 	subject	.
and	i	have	come	to	find	that	a	more	appropriate	metaphor	for	aging	is	a	 stair 	 case 	 	--	the	 up 	 ward 	 	 a 	 scen 	 s 	 ion 	 	of	the	human	spirit	,	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	us	 in 	 to 	 	 wis 	 dom 	 	,	 whole 	 ness 	 	and	 authentic 	 ity 	 	.
age	not	at	all	 a 	 s 	 	 path 	 ology 	 	;	age	 a 	 s 	 	potential	.
and	guess	what	?
 th 	 is 	 	potential	is	not	for	the	 luck 	 y 	 	few	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	,	most	people	over	50	feel	better	,	are	less	 stress 	 ed 	 	,	are	less	 hostil 	 e 	 	,	less	 anx 	 ious 	 	.
we	tend	to	see	 common 	 al 	 ities 	 	more	than	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	.
some	of	the	 stud 	 ies 	 	even	say	we	're	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	what	i	 expect 	 ed 	 	,	trust	me	.
i	come	from	a	long	line	of	 depress 	 ive 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	was	 approach 	 ing 	 	my	late	40s	,	when	i	would	wake	up	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	my	first	six	 thought 	 s 	 	would	all	be	negative	.
and	i	got	 scar 	 ed 	 	.
i	thought	,	oh	my	 go 	 sh 	 	.
i	'm	going	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	 crotch 	 ety 	 	old	 lad 	 y 	 	.
but	now	that	i	am	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 mack 	 	-	dab	in	the	middle	of	my	own	third	act	,	i	 real 	 ize 	 	i	've	never	 be 	 en 	 	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	.
i	have	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 power 	 ful 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	.
and	i	've	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	when	you	're	 in 	 side 	 	 old 	 ness 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	looking	at	it	from	the	 out 	 side 	 	,	fear	 sub 	 side 	 s 	 	.
you	 real 	 ize 	 	,	you	're	still	 your 	 self 	 	--	 may 	 be 	 	even	more	so	.
picasso	once	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	it	 take 	 s 	 	a	long	time	to	 be 	 come 	 	young	.	``
i	do	n't	want	to	 romantic 	 ize 	 	aging	.
 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	there	's	no	guarantee	that	it	can	be	a	time	of	 fruit 	 ion 	 	and	growth	.
some	of	it	is	a	matter	of	luck	.
some	of	it	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	is	genetic	.
one	third	of	it	,	in	fact	,	is	genetic	.
and	there	is	n't	much	we	can	do	about	that	.
but	that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	two	-	 third 	 s 	 	of	how	well	we	do	in	the	third	act	,	we	can	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	.
we	're	going	to	discuss	what	we	can	do	to	make	these	 add 	 ed 	 	 year 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	and	use	them	to	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
now	let	me	say	 some 	 thing 	 	about	the	 stair 	 case 	 	,	which	may	seem	like	an	odd	metaphor	for	 senior 	 s 	 	 give 	 n 	 	the	fact	that	 man 	 y 	 	 senior 	 s 	 	are	 challeng 	 ed 	 	by	 stair 	 s 	 	.
 my 	 self 	 	 include 	 d 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	may	know	,	the	entire	world	 oper 	 ates 	 	on	a	universal	law	:	 ent 	 ropy 	 	,	the	second	law	of	 thermo 	 dynamic 	 s 	 	.
 ent 	 ropy 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	 every 	 thing 	 	in	the	world	,	 every 	 thing 	 	,	is	in	a	state	of	decline	and	decay	,	the	arch	.
there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	one	exception	to	 th 	 is 	 	universal	law	,	and	that	is	the	human	spirit	,	which	can	 continu 	 e 	 	to	evolve	 up 	 ward 	 s 	 	--	the	 stair 	 case 	 	--	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	us	 in 	 to 	 	 whole 	 ness 	 	,	 authentic 	 ity 	 	and	 wis 	 dom 	 	.
and	here	's	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	what	i	mean	.
 th 	 is 	 	 up 	 ward 	 	 a 	 scen 	 s 	 ion 	 	can	happen	even	in	the	face	of	 extrem 	 e 	 	physical	 challeng 	 es 	 	.
about	three	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	i	read	an	article	in	the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	.
it	was	about	a	man	named	neil	selinger	--	57	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	a	 retire 	 d 	 	lawyer	--	who	had	 join 	 ed 	 	the	 writer 	 s 	 	group	at	sarah	lawrence	where	he	found	his	writer	's	voice	.
two	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	he	was	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	with	als	,	 common 	 ly 	 	known	 a 	 s 	 	lou	gehrig	's	disease	.
it	's	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	disease	.	it	's	fatal	.
it	 waste 	 s 	 	the	body	,	but	the	mind	 remain 	 s 	 	 in 	 tact 	 	.
in	 th 	 is 	 	article	,	mr.	selinger	wrote	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	what	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	to	him	.
and	i	quote	,	``	 a 	 s 	 	my	 muscle 	 s 	 	 weak 	 ened 	 	,	my	writing	 be 	 came 	 	 strong 	 er 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	lost	my	speech	,	i	 gain 	 ed 	 	my	voice	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	 diminish 	 ed 	 	,	i	grew	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	lost	so	much	,	i	 final 	 ly 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	to	find	 my 	 self 	 	.	``
neil	selinger	,	to	me	,	is	the	 embodi 	 ment 	 	of	 mount 	 ing 	 	the	 stair 	 case 	 	in	his	third	act	.
now	we	're	all	born	with	spirit	,	all	of	us	,	but	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	it	 get 	 s 	 	tamped	down	 be 	 neath 	 	the	 challeng 	 es 	 	of	life	,	violence	,	abuse	,	neglect	.
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	our	 parent 	 s 	 	 suffer 	 ed 	 	from	 depress 	 ion 	 	.
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	able	to	love	us	beyond	how	we	 perform 	 ed 	 	in	the	world	.
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	we	still	suffer	from	a	 psych 	 ic 	 	pain	,	a	wound	.
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	we	feel	that	 man 	 y 	 	of	our	 relationship 	 s 	 	have	not	had	closure	.
and	so	we	can	feel	 un 	 finish 	 ed 	 	.
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	the	task	of	the	third	act	is	to	finish	up	the	task	of	 finish 	 ing 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
for	me	,	it	 beg 	 an 	 	 a 	 s 	 	i	was	 approach 	 ing 	 	my	third	act	,	my	60th	 birth 	 day 	 	.
how	was	i	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	live	it	?
what	was	i	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	accomplish	in	 th 	 is 	 	final	act	?
and	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	,	in	order	to	know	where	i	was	going	,	i	had	to	know	where	i	'd	 be 	 en 	 	.
and	so	i	went	back	and	i	 stud 	 ied 	 	my	first	two	 act 	 s 	 	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	see	who	i	was	then	,	who	i	 re 	 ally 	 	was	--	not	who	my	 parent 	 s 	 	or	other	people	told	me	i	was	,	or	 treat 	 ed 	 	me	like	i	was	.
but	who	was	i	?	who	 we 	 re 	 	my	 parent 	 s 	 	--	not	 a 	 s 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	people	?
who	 we 	 re 	 	my	 grand 	 parent 	 s 	 	?
how	did	they	treat	my	 parent 	 s 	 	?
these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
i	 discover 	 ed 	 	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	process	that	i	had	gone	through	is	 call 	 ed 	 	by	 psycho 	 logists 	 	``	 do 	 ing 	 	a	life	review	.	``
and	they	say	it	can	give	new	 sign 	 ific 	 ance 	 	and	 clar 	 ity 	 	and	meaning	to	a	person	's	life	.
you	may	discover	,	 a 	 s 	 	i	did	,	that	a	lot	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	used	to	think	 we 	 re 	 	your	fault	,	a	lot	of	 thing 	 s 	 	you	used	to	think	about	 your 	 self 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	had	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	you	.
it	was	n't	your	fault	;	you	're	just	fine	.
and	you	're	able	to	go	back	and	forgive	them	and	forgive	 your 	 self 	 	.
you	're	able	to	free	 your 	 self 	 	from	your	past	.
you	can	work	to	change	your	relationship	to	your	past	.
now	while	i	was	writing	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	i	came	 up 	 on 	 	a	book	 call 	 ed 	 	``	man	's	search	for	meaning	``	by	viktor	frankl	.
viktor	frankl	was	a	german	psychiatrist	who	'd	 s 	 pent 	 	five	 year 	 s 	 	in	a	nazi	 concent 	 ration 	 	camp	.
and	he	wrote	that	,	while	he	was	in	the	camp	,	he	could	tell	,	should	they	ever	be	released	,	which	of	the	people	would	be	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	and	which	would	not	.
and	he	wrote	 th 	 is 	 	:	``	 every 	 thing 	 	you	have	in	life	can	be	taken	from	you	 ex 	 cept 	 	one	thing	,	your	 free 	 dom 	 	to	 choos 	 e 	 	how	you	will	respond	to	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	what	 determine 	 s 	 	the	quality	of	the	life	we	've	lived	--	not	 whet 	 her 	 	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	rich	or	poor	,	famous	or	 un 	 known 	 	,	 health 	 y 	 	or	 suffer 	 ing 	 	.
what	 determine 	 s 	 	our	quality	of	life	is	how	we	 re 	 late 	 	to	these	 real 	 ities 	 	,	what	kind	of	meaning	we	assign	them	,	what	kind	of	attitude	we	 cl 	 ing 	 	to	about	them	,	what	state	of	mind	we	allow	them	to	trigger	.	``
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	the	central	purpose	of	the	third	act	is	to	go	back	and	to	try	,	if	appropriate	,	to	change	our	relationship	to	the	past	.
it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	cognitive	research	 show 	 s 	 	when	we	are	able	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	it	 manifest 	 s 	 	 neuro 	 logically 	 	--	neural	 path 	 ways 	 	are	 create 	 d 	 	in	the	brain	.
you	see	,	if	you	have	,	over	time	,	 react 	 ed 	 	 negative 	 ly 	 	to	past	 event 	 s 	 	and	people	,	neural	 path 	 ways 	 	are	laid	down	by	chemical	and	 electric 	 al 	 	 signal 	 s 	 	that	are	 s 	 ent 	 	through	the	brain	.
and	over	time	,	these	neural	 path 	 ways 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 hard 	 wired 	 	,	they	 be 	 come 	 	the	norm	--	even	if	it	's	bad	for	us	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 cause 	 s 	 	us	stress	and	 anxie 	 ty 	 	.
we	can	go	back	and	alter	our	relationship	,	re	-	vision	our	relationship	to	past	people	and	 event 	 s 	 	,	neural	 path 	 ways 	 	can	change	.
and	if	we	can	maintain	the	more	positive	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	about	the	past	,	that	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	the	new	norm	.
it	's	like	 re 	 setting 	 	a	 thermo 	 stat 	 	.
it	's	not	 hav 	 ing 	 	 experience 	 s 	 	that	make	us	wise	,	it	's	 reflect 	 ing 	 	on	the	 experience 	 s 	 	that	we	've	had	that	 make 	 s 	 	us	wise	--	and	that	 help 	 s 	 	us	 be 	 come 	 	whole	,	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	 wis 	 dom 	 	and	 authentic 	 ity 	 	.
it	 help 	 s 	 	us	 be 	 come 	 	what	we	might	have	 be 	 en 	 	.
women	start	off	whole	,	do	n't	we	?
i	mean	,	 a 	 s 	 	 girl 	 s 	 	,	we	start	off	feisty	--	``	 yea 	 h 	 	,	who	 say 	 s 	 	?	``
we	have	 age 	 ncy 	 	.
we	are	the	 subject 	 s 	 	of	our	own	 live 	 s 	 	.
but	 ver 	 y 	 	often	,	 man 	 y 	 	,	if	not	most	of	us	,	when	we	hit	puberty	,	we	start	 worry 	 ing 	 	about	fitting	in	and	 be 	 ing 	 	popular	.
and	we	 be 	 come 	 	the	 subject 	 s 	 	and	 object 	 s 	 	of	other	people	's	 live 	 s 	 	.
but	now	,	in	our	third	 act 	 s 	 	,	it	may	be	possible	for	us	to	circle	back	to	where	we	 start 	 ed 	 	and	know	it	for	the	first	time	.
and	if	we	can	do	that	,	it	will	not	just	be	for	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
 old 	 er 	 	women	are	the	largest	 demo 	 graphic 	 	in	the	world	.
if	we	can	go	back	and	 re 	 define 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	 be 	 come 	 	whole	,	 th 	 is 	 	will	create	a	cultural	shift	in	the	world	,	and	it	will	give	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	to	 young 	 er 	 	 generation 	 s 	 	so	that	they	can	 re 	 conceiv 	 e 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 life 	 span 	 	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
