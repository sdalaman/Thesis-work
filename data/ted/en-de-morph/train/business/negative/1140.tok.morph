it	's	great	 be 	 ing 	 	here	at	ted	.
you	know	,	i	think	there	might	be	some	 present 	 ations 	 	that	will	go	over	my	head	,	but	the	most	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	are	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	go	right	under	my	feet	.
the	little	 thing 	 s 	 	in	life	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	that	we	forget	about	,	like	 pollinat 	 ion 	 	,	that	we	take	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	.
and	you	ca	n't	tell	the	story	about	 pollinat 	 ors 	 	--	bees	,	 bat 	 s 	 	,	 humming 	 bird 	 s 	 	,	 butter 	 flies 	 	--	 with 	 out 	 	 tell 	 ing 	 	the	story	about	the	 invent 	 ion 	 	of	 flower 	 s 	 	and	how	they	co	-	 evolv 	 ed 	 	over	50	million	 year 	 s 	 	.
i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 film 	 ing 	 	time	-	lapse	 flower 	 s 	 	24	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	,	seven	 day 	 s 	 	a	week	,	for	over	35	 year 	 s 	 	.
to	watch	them	move	is	a	dance	i	'm	never	going	to	get	 tire 	 d 	 	of	.
it	 fill 	 s 	 	me	with	wonder	,	and	it	 open 	 s 	 	my	heart	.
 beaut 	 y 	 	and	 s 	 eduction 	 	,	i	 believ 	 e 	 	,	is	nature	's	tool	for	 surviv 	 al 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	will	protect	what	we	fall	in	love	with	.
 the 	 ir 	 	relationship	is	a	love	story	that	 feed 	 s 	 	the	earth	.
it	 re 	 mind 	 s 	 	us	that	we	are	a	part	of	nature	,	and	we	're	not	 separat 	 e 	 	from	it	.
when	i	heard	about	the	 vanish 	 ing 	 	bees	,	 colon 	 y 	 	collapse	 dis 	 order 	 	,	it	 motiv 	 ated 	 	me	to	take	action	.
we	depend	on	 pollinat 	 ors 	 	for	over	a	third	of	the	 fruit 	 s 	 	and	 veget 	 able 	 s 	 	we	eat	.
and	 man 	 y 	 	 scientist 	 s 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	it	's	the	most	serious	issue	facing	 man 	 kind 	 	.
it	's	like	the	 can 	 ary 	 	in	the	 coal 	 mine 	 	.
if	they	disappear	,	so	do	we	.
it	 re 	 mind 	 s 	 	us	that	we	are	a	part	of	nature	and	we	need	to	take	care	of	it	.
what	 motiv 	 ated 	 	me	to	film	 the 	 ir 	 	behavior	was	 some 	 thing 	 	that	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	my	scientific	 advise 	 rs 	 	:	``	what	 motiv 	 ates 	 	the	 pollinat 	 ors 	 	?	``
well	,	 the 	 ir 	 	answer	was	,	``	it	's	all	about	risk	and	reward	.	``
like	a	wide	-	eyed	kid	,	i	'd	say	,	``	why	is	that	?	``
and	they	'd	say	,	``	well	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	want	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	.	``
i	go	,	``	why	?	``
``	well	,	in	order	to	 re 	 produce 	 	.	``
``	well	,	why	?	``
and	i	thought	that	they	'd	 prob 	 ably 	 	say	,	``	well	,	it	's	all	about	 s 	 ex 	 	.	``
and	chip	taylor	,	our	 mon 	 arch 	 	 butter 	 fly 	 	expert	,	he	 re 	 plied 	 	,	``	 noth 	 ing 	 	 last 	 s 	 	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
 every 	 thing 	 	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 wear 	 s 	 	out	.	``
and	that	 ble 	 w 	 	my	mind	.
 be 	 cause 	 	i	 real 	 ized 	 	that	nature	had	 invent 	 ed 	 	 re 	 production 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 mechan 	 ism 	 	for	life	to	move	forward	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	life	force	that	 pass 	 es 	 	right	through	us	and	 make 	 s 	 	us	a	link	in	the	evolution	of	life	.
 rare 	 ly 	 	 s 	 een 	 	by	the	naked	eye	,	 th 	 is 	 	 intersect 	 ion 	 	between	the	animal	world	and	the	plant	world	is	 tru 	 ly 	 	a	magic	moment	.
it	's	the	 mystic 	 al 	 	moment	where	life	 re 	 generate 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	,	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	.
so	here	is	some	nectar	from	my	film	.
i	hope	you	'll	drink	,	tweet	and	plant	some	 seed 	 s 	 	to	 pollinat 	 e 	 	a	friendly	garden	.
and	 al 	 ways 	 	take	time	to	smell	the	 flower 	 s 	 	,	and	let	it	fill	you	with	 beaut 	 y 	 	,	and	 re 	 discover 	 	that	sense	of	wonder	.
here	are	some	 image 	 s 	 	from	the	film	.
thank	you	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
thank	you	.
