 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	charles	darwin	was	born	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 light 	 ly 	 	 pigment 	 ed 	 	man	,	in	a	 moderate 	 ly 	 	-	to	-	 dark 	 ly 	 	 pigment 	 ed 	 	world	.
over	the	course	of	his	life	,	darwin	had	great	privilege	.
he	lived	in	a	 fair 	 ly 	 	 wealth 	 y 	 	home	.
he	was	raised	by	 ver 	 y 	 	 support 	 ive 	 	and	 interest 	 ed 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	.
and	when	he	was	in	his	20s	he	 embark 	 ed 	 	 up 	 on 	 	a	 remark 	 able 	 	voyage	on	the	ship	the	beagle	.
and	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	course	of	that	voyage	,	he	saw	 remark 	 able 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	:	tremendous	 divers 	 ity 	 	of	 plant 	 s 	 	and	 animal 	 s 	 	,	and	 human 	 s 	 	.
and	the	 observ 	 ations 	 	that	he	made	on	that	epic	journey	 we 	 re 	 	to	be	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 distill 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	his	 wonder 	 ful 	 	book	,	``	on	the	origin	of	species	,	``	 publish 	 ed 	 	150	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
now	what	is	so	 interest 	 ing 	 	and	to	some	,	the	 ex 	 tent 	 	,	what	's	a	bit	 in 	 famous 	 	about	``	the	origin	of	species	,	``	is	that	there	is	 on 	 ly 	 	one	line	in	it	about	human	evolution	.
``	light	will	be	 throw 	 n 	 	on	the	origin	of	man	and	his	 histo 	 ry 	 	.	``
it	was	n't	 un 	 til 	 	much	 long 	 er 	 	,	much	 lat 	 er 	 	,	that	darwin	 actual 	 ly 	 	spoke	and	wrote	about	 human 	 s 	 	.
now	in	his	 year 	 s 	 	of	 travel 	 ing 	 	on	the	beagle	,	and	from	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	the	 account 	 s 	 	or	 explore 	 rs 	 	and	 natural 	 ists 	 	,	he	 k 	 new 	 	that	skin	color	was	one	of	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	ways	in	which	people	 vari 	 ed 	 	.
and	he	was	 some 	 what 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	pattern	of	skin	color	.
he	 k 	 new 	 	that	 dark 	 ly 	 	 pigment 	 ed 	 	 people 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	found	close	to	the	 equ 	 ator 	 	;	 light 	 ly 	 	 pigment 	 ed 	 	 people 	 s 	 	,	like	 him 	 self 	 	,	 we 	 re 	 	found	 close 	 r 	 	to	the	 pole 	 s 	 	.
so	what	did	he	make	of	all	 th 	 is 	 	?
well	he	did	n't	write	 any 	 thing 	 	about	it	in	the	origin	of	species	.
but	much	 lat 	 er 	 	,	in	1871	,	he	did	have	 some 	 thing 	 	to	say	about	it	.
and	it	was	 quit 	 e 	 	 cur 	 ious 	 	.	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	of	all	the	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	between	the	 race 	 s 	 	of	men	,	the	color	of	the	skin	is	the	most	conspicuous	and	one	of	the	best	 mark 	 ed 	 	.	``
and	he	went	on	to	say	,	``	these	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	do	not	coincide	with	 correspond 	 ing 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	in	climate	.	``
so	he	had	 travel 	 ed 	 	all	around	.
he	had	 s 	 een 	 	people	of	different	 color 	 s 	 	living	in	different	 place 	 s 	 	.
and	yet	he	 reject 	 ed 	 	the	idea	that	human	skin	 pigment 	 ation 	 	was	related	to	the	climate	.
if	 on 	 ly 	 	darwin	lived	 to 	 day 	 	.
if	 on 	 ly 	 	darwin	had	nasa	.
now	,	one	of	the	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	nasa	 do 	 es 	 	is	it	 put 	 s 	 	up	a	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 satellite 	 s 	 	that	detect	all	sort	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	about	our	environment	.
and	for	 man 	 y 	 	 decade 	 s 	 	now	there	have	 be 	 en 	 	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	toms	 satellite 	 s 	 	that	have	 collect 	 ed 	 	data	about	the	 radi 	 ation 	 	of	the	earth	's	surface	.
the	toms	7	satellite	data	,	 show 	 n 	 	here	,	show	the	annual	average	 ultra 	 viol 	 et 	 	 radi 	 ation 	 	at	the	earth	's	surface	.
now	the	 re 	 ally 	 	hot	pink	and	red	 area 	 s 	 	are	 t 	 hose 	 	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	world	that	 receiv 	 e 	 	the	highest	 amount 	 s 	 	of	uv	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	year	.
the	 increment 	 ally 	 	 cool 	 er 	 	 color 	 s 	 	--	 blue 	 s 	 	,	 green 	 s 	 	,	 yellow 	 s 	 	,	and	 final 	 ly 	 	 gray 	 s 	 	--	 indic 	 ate 	 	 area 	 s 	 	of	much	lower	 ultra 	 viol 	 et 	 	 radi 	 ation 	 	.
what	's	significant	to	the	story	of	human	skin	 pigment 	 ation 	 	is	just	how	much	of	the	 north 	 ern 	 	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	is	in	these	cool	gray	 zone 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	tremendous	 implic 	 ations 	 	for	our	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	the	evolution	of	human	skin	 pigment 	 ation 	 	.
and	what	darwin	could	not	appreciate	,	or	did	n't	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	want	to	appreciate	at	the	time	,	is	that	there	was	a	fundamental	relationship	between	the	 intens 	 ity 	 	of	 ultra 	 viol 	 et 	 	 radi 	 ation 	 	and	skin	 pigment 	 ation 	 	.
and	that	skin	 pigment 	 ation 	 	 it 	 self 	 	was	a	product	of	evolution	.
and	so	when	we	look	at	a	map	of	skin	color	,	and	 predict 	 ed 	 	skin	color	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	know	it	 to 	 day 	 	,	what	we	see	is	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 grad 	 ient 	 	from	the	 dark 	 est 	 	skin	 pigment 	 ations 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	the	 equ 	 ator 	 	,	and	the	 light 	 est 	 	 one 	 s 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	the	 pole 	 s 	 	.
what	's	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	here	is	that	the	 ear 	 liest 	 	 human 	 s 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	in	high	-	uv	 environment 	 s 	 	,	in	 equ 	 ator 	 ial 	 	africa	.
the	 ear 	 liest 	 	 member 	 s 	 	of	our	 line 	 age 	 	,	the	 gen 	 us 	 	homo	,	 we 	 re 	 	 dark 	 ly 	 	 pigment 	 ed 	 	.
and	we	all	share	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	heritage	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	 original 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 dark 	 ly 	 	 pigment 	 ed 	 	,	two	million	to	one	and	half	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
now	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	our	 histo 	 ry 	 	?
let	's	first	look	at	the	relationship	of	 ultra 	 viol 	 et 	 	 radi 	 ation 	 	to	the	earth	's	surface	.
in	 t 	 hose 	 	early	 day 	 s 	 	of	our	evolution	,	looking	at	the	 equ 	 ator 	 	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 bombard 	 ed 	 	by	high	 level 	 s 	 	of	 ultra 	 viol 	 et 	 	 radi 	 ation 	 	.
the	uvc	,	the	most	 energ 	 etic 	 	type	,	was	 oc 	 clud 	 ed 	 	by	the	earth	's	atmosphere	.
but	uvb	and	uva	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	,	came	in	 un 	 impede 	 d 	 	.
uvb	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	be	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 destruct 	 ive 	 	,	but	it	 al 	 so 	 	 catalyze 	 s 	 	the	production	of	 vita 	 min 	 	d	in	the	skin	,	 vita 	 min 	 	d	 be 	 ing 	 	a	molecule	that	we	 ver 	 y 	 	much	need	for	our	strong	 bone 	 s 	 	,	the	health	of	our	 immun 	 e 	 	system	,	and	myriad	other	 import 	 ant 	 	 function 	 s 	 	in	our	bodies	.
so	,	living	at	the	 equ 	 ator 	 	,	we	got	 lot 	 s 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 ultra 	 viol 	 et 	 	 radi 	 ation 	 	and	the	 mel 	 an 	 in 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	,	complex	,	ancient	polymer	 com 	 pound 	 	in	our	skin	--	 serv 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 super 	 b 	 	natural	 s 	 un 	 screen 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	polymer	is	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	present	in	so	 man 	 y 	 	different	 organism 	 s 	 	.
 mel 	 an 	 in 	 	,	in	 vari 	 ous 	 	 form 	 s 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 prob 	 ably 	 	 be 	 en 	 	on	the	earth	a	billion	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 recruit 	 ed 	 	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	by	evolution	,	 a 	 s 	 	often	 happen 	 s 	 	.
why	change	it	if	it	 work 	 s 	 	?
so	 mel 	 an 	 in 	 	was	 recruit 	 ed 	 	,	in	our	 line 	 age 	 	,	and	 specific 	 ally 	 	in	our	 ear 	 liest 	 	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	 evolv 	 ing 	 	in	africa	,	to	be	a	natural	 s 	 un 	 screen 	 	.
where	it	 protect 	 ed 	 	the	body	against	the	 degradation 	 s 	 	of	 ultra 	 viol 	 et 	 	 radi 	 ation 	 	,	the	 destruct 	 ion 	 	,	or	damage	to	dna	,	and	the	 break 	 down 	 	of	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	molecule	 call 	 ed 	 	 fol 	 ate 	 	,	which	 help 	 s 	 	to	fuel	cell	production	,	and	 re 	 production 	 	in	the	body	.
so	,	it	's	 wonder 	 ful 	 	.	we	 evolv 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 protect 	 ive 	 	,	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 cover 	 ing 	 	of	 mel 	 an 	 in 	 	.
but	then	we	 move 	 d 	 	.
and	 human 	 s 	 	 dispers 	 ed 	 	--	not	once	,	but	twice	.
major	 move 	 s 	 	,	 out 	 side 	 	of	our	 equ 	 ator 	 ial 	 	 home 	 land 	 	,	from	africa	 in 	 to 	 	other	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	old	world	,	and	most	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	 in 	 to 	 	the	new	world	.
when	 human 	 s 	 	 dispers 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	these	 latitude 	 s 	 	,	what	did	they	face	?
 condition 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 significant 	 ly 	 	 cold 	 er 	 	,	but	they	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 so 	 	less	 intens 	 e 	 	with	respect	to	the	 ultra 	 viol 	 et 	 	regime	.
so	if	we	're	 some 	 where 	 	in	the	 north 	 ern 	 	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	,	look	at	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	to	the	 ultra 	 viol 	 et 	 	 radi 	 ation 	 	.
we	're	still	 get 	 ting 	 	a	dose	of	uva	.
but	all	of	the	uvb	,	or	 near 	 ly 	 	all	of	it	,	is	 dissipate 	 d 	 	through	the	 thick 	 ness 	 	of	the	atmosphere	.
in	the	winter	,	when	you	are	 ski 	 ing 	 	in	the	alps	,	you	may	experience	 ultra 	 viol 	 et 	 	 radi 	 ation 	 	.
but	it	's	all	uva	,	and	,	 significant 	 ly 	 	,	that	uva	 ha 	 s 	 	no	ability	to	make	 vita 	 min 	 	d	in	your	skin	.
so	people	 inhabit 	 ing 	 	 north 	 ern 	 	 hemi 	 spheric 	 	 environment 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 be 	 re 	 ft 	 	of	the	potential	to	make	 vita 	 min 	 	d	in	 the 	 ir 	 	skin	for	most	of	the	year	.
 th 	 is 	 	had	tremendous	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	for	the	evolution	of	human	skin	 pigment 	 ation 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	in	order	to	ensure	health	and	well	-	 be 	 ing 	 	,	these	 line 	 age 	 s 	 	of	people	 dispers 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 north 	 ern 	 	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	lost	 the 	 ir 	 	 pigment 	 ation 	 	.
there	was	natural	 s 	 election 	 	for	the	evolution	of	 light 	 ly 	 	 pigment 	 ed 	 	skin	.
here	we	begin	to	see	the	evolution	of	the	 beaut 	 iful 	 	sepia	 rain 	 bow 	 	that	now	 character 	 ize 	 s 	 	all	of	 human 	 ity 	 	.
 light 	 ly 	 	 pigment 	 ed 	 	skin	 evolv 	 ed 	 	not	just	once	,	not	just	twice	,	but	 prob 	 ably 	 	three	 time 	 s 	 	.
not	just	in	modern	 human 	 s 	 	,	but	in	one	of	our	 di 	 stant 	 	 un 	 related 	 	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	,	the	 neanderthal 	 s 	 	.
a	 remark 	 able 	 	,	 remark 	 able 	 	 test 	 a 	 ment 	 	to	the	power	of	evolution	.
 human 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	on	the	move	for	a	long	time	.
and	just	in	the	last	5,000	 year 	 s 	 	,	in	increasing	rates	,	over	increasing	 distance 	 s 	 	.
here	are	just	some	of	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 move 	 ments 	 	of	people	,	voluntary	 move 	 ments 	 	,	in	the	last	5,000	 year 	 s 	 	.
look	at	some	of	the	major	 lat 	 itudinal 	 	 transgress 	 ions 	 	:	people	from	high	uv	 area 	 s 	 	going	to	low	uv	and	vice	versa	.
and	not	all	these	 move 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	voluntary	.
between	1520	and	1867	,	12	million	,	500	people	 we 	 re 	 	 move 	 d 	 	from	high	uv	to	low	uv	 area 	 s 	 	in	the	transatlantic	slave	trade	.
now	 th 	 is 	 	had	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 in 	 vid 	 ious 	 	social	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	.
but	it	 al 	 so 	 	had	 delet 	 er 	 ious 	 	health	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	to	people	.
so	what	?	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	on	the	move	.
we	're	so	clever	we	can	 over 	 come 	 	all	of	these	 seem 	 ing 	 	 bio 	 logical 	 	 impediment 	 s 	 	.
well	,	often	we	're	 un 	 aware 	 	of	the	fact	that	we	're	living	in	 environment 	 s 	 	in	which	our	skin	is	 inherent 	 ly 	 	 poor 	 ly 	 	 adapt 	 ed 	 	.
some	of	us	with	 light 	 ly 	 	 pigment 	 ed 	 	skin	live	in	high	-	uv	 area 	 s 	 	.
some	of	us	with	 dark 	 ly 	 	 pigment 	 ed 	 	skin	live	in	low	-	uv	 area 	 s 	 	.
these	have	tremendous	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	for	our	health	.
we	have	to	,	if	we	're	 light 	 ly 	 	 pigment 	 ed 	 	,	be	 care 	 ful 	 	about	the	 problem 	 s 	 	of	skin	cancer	,	and	 destruct 	 ion 	 	of	 fol 	 ate 	 	in	our	bodies	,	by	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 s 	 un 	 	.
 epidemio 	 logists 	 	and	 doctor 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	good	about	 tell 	 ing 	 	us	about	 protect 	 ing 	 	our	skin	.
what	they	have	n't	 be 	 en 	 	so	good	about	 instruct 	 ing 	 	people	is	the	problem	of	 dark 	 ly 	 	 pigment 	 ed 	 	people	living	in	high	latitude	 area 	 s 	 	,	or	 work 	 ing 	 	 in 	 side 	 	all	the	time	.
 be 	 cause 	 	the	problem	there	is	just	 a 	 s 	 	severe	,	but	it	is	more	 s 	 ini 	 ster 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 vita 	 min 	 	d	 defici 	 ency 	 	,	from	a	lack	of	 ultra 	 viol 	 et 	 	b	 radi 	 ation 	 	,	is	a	major	problem	.
 vita 	 min 	 	d	 defici 	 ency 	 	 creep 	 s 	 	up	on	people	,	and	 cause 	 s 	 	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	health	 problem 	 s 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 bone 	 s 	 	,	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 gradu 	 al 	 	decay	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 immun 	 e 	 	 system 	 s 	 	,	or	loss	of	 immun 	 e 	 	function	,	and	 prob 	 ably 	 	some	 problem 	 s 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	mood	and	health	,	 the 	 ir 	 	mental	health	.
so	we	have	,	in	skin	 pigment 	 ation 	 	,	one	of	these	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 product 	 s 	 	of	evolution	that	still	 ha 	 s 	 	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	for	us	 to 	 day 	 	.
and	the	social	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	know	,	are	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 pro 	 found 	 	.
we	live	in	a	world	where	we	have	 light 	 ly 	 	and	 dark 	 ly 	 	 pigment 	 ed 	 	people	living	next	to	one	 an 	 other 	 	,	but	often	 br 	 ought 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 proxim 	 ity 	 	 initi 	 ally 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	 ver 	 y 	 	 in 	 vid 	 ious 	 	social	 interact 	 ions 	 	.
so	how	can	we	 over 	 come 	 	 th 	 is 	 	?
how	can	we	begin	to	understand	it	?
evolution	 help 	 s 	 	us	.
200	 year 	 s 	 	after	darwin	's	 birth 	 day 	 	,	we	have	the	first	 moderate 	 ly 	 	 pigment 	 ed 	 	 p 	 resident 	 	of	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
how	 wonder 	 ful 	 	is	that	?
 th 	 is 	 	man	is	significant	for	a	whole	host	of	 reason 	 s 	 	.
but	we	need	to	think	about	how	he	 compar 	 es 	 	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	his	 pigment 	 ation 	 	,	to	other	people	on	earth	.
he	,	 a 	 s 	 	one	of	 man 	 y 	 	urban	 ad 	 mix 	 ed 	 	 population 	 s 	 	,	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 emblem 	 atic 	 	of	a	 mix 	 ed 	 	 parent 	 age 	 	,	of	a	 mix 	 ed 	 	 pigment 	 ation 	 	.
and	he	 resemble 	 s 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 close 	 ly 	 	,	people	with	moderate	 level 	 s 	 	of	 pigment 	 ation 	 	who	live	in	southern	africa	,	or	 south 	 east 	 	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	.
these	people	have	a	tremendous	potential	to	tan	,	to	develop	more	pigment	in	 the 	 ir 	 	skin	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	 expo 	 s 	 ure 	 	to	 s 	 un 	 	.
they	 al 	 so 	 	run	the	risk	of	 vita 	 min 	 	d	 defici 	 ency 	 	,	if	they	have	desk	 job 	 s 	 	,	like	that	guy	.
so	lets	all	wish	for	his	great	health	,	and	his	 aware 	 ness 	 	of	his	own	skin	 pigment 	 ation 	 	.
now	what	is	 wonder 	 ful 	 	about	the	evolution	of	human	skin	 pigment 	 ation 	 	,	and	the	 phenomen 	 on 	 	of	 pigment 	 ation 	 	,	is	that	it	is	the	 demonst 	 ration 	 	,	the	evidence	,	of	evolution	by	natural	 s 	 election 	 	,	right	on	your	body	.
when	people	ask	you	,	``	what	is	the	evidence	for	evolution	?	``
you	do	n't	have	to	think	about	some	 ex 	 otic 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	,	or	 fossil 	 s 	 	.
you	just	have	to	look	at	your	skin	.
darwin	,	i	think	,	would	have	 appreciate 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	he	 es 	 chew 	 ed 	 	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	climate	on	the	evolution	of	 pigment 	 ation 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	his	own	life	.
i	think	,	 we 	 re 	 	he	able	to	look	at	the	evidence	we	have	 to 	 day 	 	,	he	would	understand	it	.
he	would	appreciate	it	.
and	most	of	all	,	he	would	teach	it	.
you	,	you	can	teach	it	.
you	can	touch	it	.
you	can	understand	it	.
take	it	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	room	.
take	your	skin	color	,	and	 celebr 	 ate 	 	it	.
spread	the	word	.
you	have	the	evolution	of	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	our	species	,	part	of	it	,	written	in	your	skin	.
understand	it	.	appreciate	it	.	 celebr 	 ate 	 	it	.
go	out	.	is	n't	it	 beaut 	 iful 	 	?	is	n't	it	 wonder 	 ful 	 	?
you	are	the	 product 	 s 	 	of	evolution	.
thank	you	.
