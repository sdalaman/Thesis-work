in	october	2010	,	the	justice	league	of	america	will	be	 team 	 ing 	 	up	with	the	99	.
 icon 	 s 	 	like	batman	,	 super 	 man 	 	,	wonder	woman	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	will	be	 team 	 ing 	 	up	with	 icon 	 s 	 	jabbar	,	noora	,	jami	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	.
it	's	a	story	of	 inter 	 cultural 	 	 intersect 	 ions 	 	,	and	what	better	group	to	have	 th 	 is 	 	conversation	than	 t 	 hose 	 	that	grew	out	of	 fight 	 ing 	 	 fasci 	 sm 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 respect 	 ive 	 	 histo 	 ries 	 	and	 ge 	 ographies 	 	?
 a 	 s 	 	 fasci 	 sm 	 	took	over	europe	in	the	1930s	,	an	 un 	 like 	 ly 	 	 re 	 action 	 	came	out	of	north	america	.
 a 	 s 	 	christian	 icon 	 ography 	 	got	 change 	 d 	 	,	and	swastikas	 we 	 re 	 	 create 	 d 	 	out	of	 crucifix 	 es 	 	,	batman	and	 super 	 man 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 create 	 d 	 	by	jewish	young	men	in	the	 unit 	 ed 	 	 state 	 s 	 	and	canada	,	 al 	 so 	 	going	back	to	the	 b 	 ible 	 	.
consider	 th 	 is 	 	:	like	the	 prophet 	 s 	 	,	all	the	 super 	 heroes 	 	are	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	.
 super 	 man 	 	's	 parent 	 s 	 	die	on	krypton	before	the	age	of	one	.
bruce	wayne	,	who	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	batman	,	 lose 	 s 	 	his	 parent 	 s 	 	at	the	age	of	six	in	gotham	city	.
spiderman	is	raised	by	his	aunt	and	uncle	.
and	all	of	them	,	just	like	the	 prophet 	 s 	 	who	get	 the 	 ir 	 	 mess 	 age 	 	from	god	through	gabriel	,	get	 the 	 ir 	 	 mess 	 age 	 	from	above	.
peter	parker	is	in	a	library	in	manhattan	when	the	spider	 descend 	 s 	 	from	above	and	 give 	 s 	 	him	his	 mess 	 age 	 	through	a	bite	.
bruce	wayne	is	in	his	 bed 	 room 	 	when	a	big	bat	flies	over	his	head	,	and	he	 s 	 ees 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	an	 o 	 men 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	batman	.
 super 	 man 	 	is	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 s 	 ent 	 	to	earth	from	the	 heaven 	 s 	 	,	or	krypton	,	but	he	's	 s 	 ent 	 	in	a	pod	,	much	like	moses	was	on	the	nile	.
and	you	hear	the	voice	of	his	father	,	jor	-	el	,	 say 	 ing 	 	to	earth	,	``	i	have	 s 	 ent 	 	to	you	my	 on 	 ly 	 	son	.	``
these	are	 clear 	 ly 	 	biblical	 arche 	 type 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 think 	 ing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	that	was	to	create	positive	,	 global 	 ly 	 	-	 reson 	 ating 	 	 story 	 lines 	 	that	could	be	 ti 	 ed 	 	to	the	same	 thing 	 s 	 	that	other	people	 we 	 re 	 	 pull 	 ing 	 	mean	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	out	of	 be 	 cause 	 	then	the	person	that	's	using	 relig 	 ion 	 	for	the	wrong	purpose	just	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	bad	man	with	a	bad	 mess 	 age 	 	.
and	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	by	 link 	 ing 	 	positive	 thing 	 s 	 	that	the	negative	can	be	 de 	 linked 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	kind	of	 think 	 ing 	 	that	went	 in 	 to 	 	creating	the	99	.
the	99	 re 	 ference 	 s 	 	the	99	 attribut 	 es 	 	of	allah	in	the	koran	,	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 gene 	 ros 	 ity 	 	and	 merc 	 y 	 	and	 fore 	 sight 	 	and	 wis 	 dom 	 	and	 dozen 	 s 	 	of	 other 	 s 	 	that	no	two	people	in	the	world	would	disagree	about	.
it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	what	your	 relig 	 ion 	 	is	;	even	if	you	're	an	atheist	,	you	do	n't	raise	your	kid	 tell 	 ing 	 	him	,	you	know	,	``	make	 s 	 ure 	 	you	lie	three	 time 	 s 	 	a	day	.	``
 t 	 hose 	 	are	 bas 	 ic 	 	human	 value 	 s 	 	.
and	so	the	 back 	 story 	 	of	the	99	 take 	 s 	 	place	in	1258	,	which	 histo 	 ry 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	us	the	mongols	 invad 	 ed 	 	baghdad	and	 destroy 	 ed 	 	it	.
all	the	 book 	 s 	 	from	bait	al-hikma	library	,	the	most	famous	library	in	 it 	 s 	 	day	,	 we 	 re 	 	 throw 	 n 	 	in	the	tigris	river	,	and	the	tigris	 change 	 s 	 	color	with	ink	.
it	's	a	story	 pass 	 ed 	 	on	generation	after	generation	.
i	 re 	 wrote 	 	that	story	,	and	in	my	version	,	the	 librarian 	 s 	 	find	out	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	happen	--	and	here	's	a	side	note	:	if	you	want	a	 com 	 ic 	 	book	to	do	well	,	make	the	 librarian 	 s 	 	the	hero	.	it	 al 	 ways 	 	 work 	 s 	 	well	.
so	the	 librarian 	 s 	 	find	out	and	they	get	together	a	special	solution	,	a	chemical	solution	 call 	 ed 	 	king	's	water	,	that	when	 mix 	 ed 	 	with	99	 stone 	 s 	 	would	be	able	to	 s 	 ave 	 	all	that	culture	and	 histo 	 ry 	 	in	the	 book 	 s 	 	.
but	the	mongols	get	there	first	.
the	 book 	 s 	 	and	the	solution	get	 throw 	 n 	 	in	the	tigris	river	.
some	 librarian 	 s 	 	 es 	 cape 	 	,	and	over	the	course	of	 day 	 s 	 	and	 week 	 s 	 	,	they	dip	the	 stone 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	tigris	and	suck	up	that	 collect 	 ive 	 	 wis 	 dom 	 	that	we	all	think	is	lost	to	 civil 	 ization 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	 stone 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 smuggle 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	three	 pray 	 er 	 	 be 	 ad 	 s 	 	of	33	 stone 	 s 	 	each	through	arabia	 in 	 to 	 	andalusia	in	spain	,	where	they	're	safe	for	200	 year 	 s 	 	.
but	in	1492	,	two	 import 	 ant 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	happen	.
the	first	is	the	fall	of	granada	,	the	last	muslim	enclave	in	europe	.
the	second	is	columbus	 final 	 ly 	 	 get 	 s 	 	funded	to	go	to	india	,	but	he	 get 	 s 	 	lost	.
so	33	of	the	 stone 	 s 	 	are	 smuggle 	 d 	 	onto	the	nina	,	the	pinta	and	the	santa	maria	and	are	spread	in	the	new	world	.
thirty	-	three	go	on	the	silk	road	to	 chin 	 a 	 	,	south	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	and	 south 	 east 	 	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	.
and	33	are	spread	between	europe	,	the	middle	east	and	africa	.
and	now	it	's	2010	,	and	there	are	99	heroes	from	99	different	 count 	 ries 	 	.
now	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	to	 assum 	 e 	 	that	 t 	 hose 	 	 book 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	from	a	library	 call 	 ed 	 	bait	al-hikma	,	 we 	 re 	 	muslim	 book 	 s 	 	,	but	that	's	not	the	case	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 calip 	 h 	 	that	built	that	library	,	his	name	was	al-ma'mun	--	he	was	harun	al-rashid	's	son	.
he	had	told	his	 advise 	 rs 	 	,	``	get	me	all	the	 scholar 	 s 	 	to	 transl 	 ate 	 	any	book	they	can	get	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	onto	 in 	 to 	 	arabic	,	and	i	will	pay	them	 it 	 s 	 	weight	in	gold	.	``
after	a	while	,	his	 advise 	 rs 	 	 complain 	 ed 	 	.
they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	your	highness	,	the	 scholar 	 s 	 	are	 cheat 	 ing 	 	.
they	're	writing	in	big	 hand 	 writing 	 	to	take	more	gold	.	``
to	which	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	let	them	be	,	 be 	 cause 	 	what	they	're	giving	us	is	worth	a	lot	more	than	what	we	're	 pay 	 ing 	 	them	.	``
so	the	idea	of	an	open	 architect 	 ure 	 	,	an	open	knowledge	,	is	not	new	to	my	neck	of	the	desert	.
the	 con 	 cept 	 	 center 	 s 	 	on	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 no 	 or 	 	 stone 	 s 	 	.
 no 	 or 	 	is	arabic	for	light	.
so	these	99	 stone 	 s 	 	,	a	few	kind	of	 rule 	 s 	 	in	the	game	:	number	one	,	you	do	n't	 choos 	 e 	 	the	stone	;	the	stone	 choos 	 es 	 	you	.
there	's	a	king	arthur	element	to	the	 story 	 line 	 	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
number	two	,	all	of	the	99	,	when	they	first	get	 the 	 ir 	 	stone	,	or	 the 	 ir 	 	power	,	abuse	it	;	they	use	it	for	self	-	interest	.
and	there	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	 mess 	 age 	 	in	there	that	when	you	start	 ab 	 using 	 	your	stone	,	you	get	taken	advantage	of	by	people	who	will	exploit	your	 power 	 s 	 	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
number	three	,	the	99	 stone 	 s 	 	all	have	 with 	 in 	 	them	a	 mechan 	 ism 	 	that	self	-	 update 	 s 	 	.
now	there	are	two	 group 	 s 	 	that	exist	 with 	 in 	 	the	muslim	world	.
 every 	 body 	 	 believ 	 es 	 	the	koran	is	for	all	time	and	all	place	.
some	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	the	original	 interpret 	 ation 	 	from	a	couple	thousand	 year 	 s 	 	ago	is	what	's	relevant	 to 	 day 	 	.
i	do	n't	belong	there	.
then	there	's	a	group	that	 believ 	 es 	 	the	koran	is	a	living	,	 breath 	 ing 	 	document	,	and	i	 capture 	 d 	 	that	idea	 with 	 in 	 	these	 stone 	 s 	 	that	self	-	update	.
now	the	main	bad	guy	,	rughal	,	 do 	 es 	 	not	want	these	 stone 	 s 	 	to	update	,	so	he	's	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	them	to	stop	 up 	 d 	 ating 	 	.
he	ca	n't	use	the	 stone 	 s 	 	,	but	he	can	stop	them	.
and	by	 stop 	 ping 	 	them	,	he	 ha 	 s 	 	more	of	a	 fasci 	 st 	 	agenda	,	where	he	 get 	 s 	 	some	of	the	99	to	work	for	him	--	they	're	all	 wear 	 ing 	 	cookie	-	cutter	,	same	color	 uniform 	 s 	 	they	're	not	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	 individual 	 ly 	 	express	who	they	are	and	what	they	are	.
and	he	 control 	 s 	 	them	from	the	top	down	--	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	when	they	work	for	the	other	side	,	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	when	they	find	out	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	wrong	person	,	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	 manipul 	 ated 	 	,	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	each	one	 ha 	 s 	 	a	different	,	 color 	 ful 	 	kind	of	dress	.
and	the	last	point	about	the	99	 no 	 or 	 	 stone 	 s 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	.
so	the	99	work	in	 team 	 s 	 	of	three	.
why	three	?	a	couple	of	 reason 	 s 	 	.
number	one	,	we	have	a	thing	 with 	 in 	 	islam	that	you	do	n't	 leav 	 e 	 	a	boy	and	a	girl	 al 	 one 	 	together	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	third	person	is	 tempt 	 ation 	 	or	the	devil	,	right	?
i	think	that	's	there	in	all	 culture 	 s 	 	,	right	?
but	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	about	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	it	's	not	about	 pro 	 s 	 e 	 ly 	 tizing 	 	.
there	's	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	social	 mess 	 age 	 	that	 need 	 s 	 	to	get	to	kind	of	the	 deep 	 est 	 	 cre 	 vice 	 s 	 	of	 in 	 toler 	 ance 	 	,	and	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	to	get	there	is	to	kind	of	play	the	game	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	way	i	 deal 	 t 	 	with	it	.
they	work	in	 team 	 s 	 	of	three	:	two	 boy 	 s 	 	and	a	girl	,	two	 girl 	 s 	 	and	a	boy	,	three	 boy 	 s 	 	,	three	 girl 	 s 	 	,	no	problem	.
and	the	swiss	 psycho 	 analyst 	 	,	carl	jung	,	 al 	 so 	 	spoke	about	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	the	number	three	in	all	 culture 	 s 	 	,	so	i	figure	i	'm	 cover 	 ed 	 	.
well	...
i	got	 accus 	 ed 	 	in	a	few	 blog 	 s 	 	that	i	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 ent 	 	by	the	 pop 	 e 	 	to	preach	the	trinity	and	catholicism	in	the	middle	east	,	so	you	--	you	 believ 	 e 	 	who	you	want	.	i	 g 	 ave 	 	you	my	version	of	the	story	.
so	here	's	some	of	the	 character 	 s 	 	that	we	have	.
mujiba	,	from	malaysia	:	her	main	power	is	she	's	able	to	answer	any	question	.
she	's	the	trivial	 pur 	 suit 	 	 que 	 en 	 	,	if	you	want	,	but	when	she	first	 get 	 s 	 	her	power	,	she	 start 	 s 	 	going	on	game	 show 	 s 	 	and	making	money	.
we	have	jabbar	from	saudi	who	 start 	 s 	 	 break 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	when	he	 ha 	 s 	 	the	power	.
now	,	mumita	was	a	 f 	 un 	 	one	to	name	.	mumita	is	the	 destroy 	 er 	 	.
so	the	99	 attribut 	 es 	 	of	allah	have	the	 y 	 in 	 	and	the	 y 	 ang 	 	;	there	's	the	 power 	 ful 	 	,	the	 hegemon 	 ous 	 	,	the	strong	,	and	there	's	 al 	 so 	 	the	kind	,	the	 gen 	 er 	 ous 	 	.
i	'm	like	,	are	all	the	 girl 	 s 	 	going	to	be	kind	and	 merci 	 ful 	 	and	the	 guy 	 s 	 	all	strong	?
i	'm	like	,	you	know	what	,	i	've	met	a	few	 girl 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	 destroy 	 ers 	 	in	my	 life 	 time 	 	,	so	...
we	have	jami	from	hungary	,	who	first	 start 	 s 	 	making	 weapon 	 s 	 	:	he	's	the	technology	wiz	.
musawwira	from	ghana	,	hadya	from	pakistan	,	jaleel	from	iran	who	uses	fire	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	my	 favor 	 ites 	 	,	al-batina	from	yemen	.
al-batina	is	the	 hid 	 den 	 	.
so	al-batina	is	 hid 	 den 	 	,	but	she	's	a	 super 	 hero 	 	.
i	came	home	to	my	wife	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	i	 create 	 d 	 	a	character	after	you	.	``
my	wife	is	a	saudi	from	yemeni	 root 	 s 	 	.
and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	show	me	.	``	so	i	 show 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	that	's	not	me	.	``
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	look	at	the	 eye 	 s 	 	.	they	're	your	 eye 	 s 	 	.	``
so	i	 promise 	 d 	 	my	 invest 	 ors 	 	 th 	 is 	 	would	not	be	 an 	 other 	 	made	-	in	-	fifth	-	world	-	country	production	.
 th 	 is 	 	was	going	to	be	 super 	 man 	 	,	or	it	was	n't	worth	my	time	or	 the 	 ir 	 	money	.
so	from	day	one	,	the	people	 involve 	 d 	 	in	the	project	,	bottom	left	is	fabian	nicieza	,	writer	for	x	-	men	and	power	 rang 	 ers 	 	.
next	to	him	is	dan	panosian	,	one	of	the	character	 creator 	 s 	 	for	the	modern	-	day	x	-	men	.
top	right	is	stuart	moore	,	a	writer	for	iron	man	.
next	to	him	is	john	mccrea	,	who	was	an	 in 	 ker 	 	for	spiderman	.
and	we	 enter 	 ed 	 	western	 conscious 	 ness 	 	with	a	 tag 	 line 	 	:	``	next	ramadan	,	the	world	will	have	new	heroes	,	``	back	in	2005	.
now	i	went	to	dubai	,	to	an	arab	thought	 found 	 ation 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	,	and	i	was	 wait 	 ing 	 	by	the	coffee	for	the	right	journalist	.
did	n't	have	a	product	,	but	had	energy	.
and	i	found	 some 	 body 	 	from	the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	,	and	i	 corner 	 ed 	 	him	,	and	i	 pitch 	 ed 	 	him	.
and	i	think	i	 scar 	 ed 	 	him	--	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 bas 	 ically 	 	 promise 	 d 	 	me	--	we	had	no	product	--	but	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	we	'll	give	you	a	 para 	 graph 	 	in	the	 art 	 s 	 	section	if	you	'll	just	go	away	.	``
so	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	great	.	``	so	i	 call 	 ed 	 	him	up	a	few	 week 	 s 	 	 after 	 ward 	 	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	hi	,	hesa	.	``	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	hi	.	``	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	happy	new	year	.	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	thank	you	.	we	had	a	baby	.	``	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 congratula 	 tions 	 	.	``
like	i	care	,	right	?
``	so	when	's	the	article	coming	out	?	``
he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	naif	,	islam	and	cartoon	?
that	's	not	 time 	 ly 	 	.
you	know	,	 may 	 be 	 	next	week	,	next	month	,	next	year	,	but	,	you	know	,	it	'll	come	out	.	``
so	a	few	 day 	 s 	 	after	that	,	what	 happen 	 s 	 	?
what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	the	world	 erupt 	 s 	 	in	the	danish	cartoon	 contr 	 over 	 s 	 y 	 	.
i	 be 	 came 	 	 time 	 ly 	 	.
so	 flu 	 rry 	 	of	phone	 call 	 s 	 	and	 email 	 s 	 	from	the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	.
next	thing	you	 k 	 new 	 	,	there	's	a	full	page	 cover 	 ing 	 	us	 positive 	 ly 	 	,	january	22nd	,	2006	,	which	 change 	 d 	 	our	 live 	 s 	 	 fore 	 ver 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 any 	 body 	 	googling	islam	and	cartoon	or	islam	and	 com 	 ic 	 	,	guess	what	they	got	;	they	got	me	.
and	the	99	 we 	 re 	 	like	 super 	 heroes 	 	kind	of	 fly 	 ing 	 	out	of	what	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	around	the	world	.
and	that	led	to	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	,	from	 be 	 ing 	 	in	 curr 	 ic 	 ula 	 	in	 un 	 ive 	 rs 	 ities 	 	and	 school 	 s 	 	to	--	one	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	i	have	from	south	 a 	 s 	 ia 	 	,	it	was	a	couple	of	men	with	long	 beard 	 s 	 	and	a	lot	of	 girl 	 s 	 	 wear 	 ing 	 	the	hijab	--	it	 look 	 ed 	 	like	a	school	.
the	good	news	is	they	're	all	 hold 	 ing 	 	copies	of	the	99	,	 smil 	 ing 	 	,	and	they	found	me	to	sign	the	picture	.
the	bad	news	is	they	 we 	 re 	 	all	 photo 	 copies 	 	,	so	we	did	n't	make	a	 di 	 me 	 	in	revenue	.

but	the	 big 	 gest 	 	thing	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	to	date	,	which	is	just	 amaz 	 ing 	 	,	is	that	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	a	26	-	episode	 animate 	 d 	 	 s 	 eries 	 	,	which	is	 d 	 one 	 	for	global	 audience 	 s 	 	:	in	fact	,	we	're	 al 	 ready 	 	going	to	be	in	the	u.s.	and	 tur 	 key 	 	,	we	know	.
it	's	3d	cgi	,	which	is	going	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	high	-	quality	,	written	in	hollywood	by	the	 writer 	 s 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	ben	10	and	spiderman	and	star	 war 	 s 	 	:	clone	 war 	 s 	 	.

two	of	the	 character 	 s 	 	,	jabbar	,	the	one	with	the	 muscle 	 s 	 	,	and	noora	,	the	one	that	can	use	light	,	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 wear 	 ing 	 	the	cookie	-	cutter	 fasci 	 st 	 	gray	uniform	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 be 	 ing 	 	 manipul 	 ated 	 	.
they	do	n't	know	,	ok	,	and	they	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	 an 	 other 	 	member	of	the	99	to	join	them	.
so	there	's	a	struggle	 with 	 in 	 	the	team	.
so	if	we	can	get	the	 light 	 s 	 	...
[	``	the	99	``	]	jabbar	:	dana	,	i	ca	n't	see	where	to	grab	hold	.

[	``	the	99	``	]	thank	you	.
so	``	the	99	``	is	technology	;	it	's	 entertain 	 ment 	 	;	it	's	design	.
but	that	's	 on 	 ly 	 	half	the	story	.
 a 	 s 	 	the	father	of	five	 son 	 s 	 	,	i	worry	about	who	they	're	going	to	be	using	 a 	 s 	 	role	 model 	 s 	 	.
i	worry	 be 	 cause 	 	all	around	me	,	even	 with 	 in 	 	my	 extend 	 ed 	 	family	,	i	see	 relig 	 ion 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 manipul 	 ated 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	 psycho 	 logist 	 	,	i	worry	for	the	world	in	general	,	but	worry	about	the	 per 	 ception 	 	of	how	people	see	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	my	part	of	the	world	.
now	,	i	'm	a	 clinic 	 al 	 	 psycho 	 logist 	 	.	i	'm	 licens 	 ed 	 	in	new	york	state	.
i	trained	at	bellevue	hospital	 surviv 	 ors 	 	of	 politic 	 al 	 	torture	program	,	and	i	heard	one	too	 man 	 y 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	of	people	growing	up	to	 idol 	 ize 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	,	 on 	 ly 	 	to	end	up	 be 	 ing 	 	 torture 	 d 	 	by	 the 	 ir 	 	heroes	.
and	torture	's	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	thing	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	,	but	when	it	's	 d 	 one 	 	by	your	hero	,	that	just	 break 	 s 	 	you	in	so	 man 	 y 	 	ways	.
i	left	bellevue	,	went	to	business	school	and	 start 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
now	,	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	i	refer	to	when	i	--	about	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 mess 	 age 	 	--	is	that	i	 g 	 ave 	 	a	 lectur 	 e 	 	at	the	medical	school	at	kuwait	university	,	where	i	 lectur 	 e 	 	on	the	 bio 	 logical 	 	 bas 	 is 	 	of	behavior	,	and	i	 g 	 ave 	 	the	 student 	 s 	 	two	 article 	 s 	 	,	one	from	the	new	york	 time 	 s 	 	and	one	from	new	york	magazine	.
and	i	took	away	the	name	of	the	writer	,	the	name	of	the	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	--	 every 	 thing 	 	was	gone	 ex 	 cept 	 	the	 fact 	 s 	 	.
and	the	first	one	was	about	a	group	 call 	 ed 	 	the	party	of	god	,	who	 want 	 ed 	 	to	ban	 valent 	 ine 	 	's	day	.	red	was	made	 il 	 legal 	 	.
any	 boy 	 s 	 	and	 girl 	 s 	 	caught	 flirt 	 ing 	 	would	get	married	off	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
the	second	one	was	about	a	woman	 complain 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	three	 mini 	 van 	 s 	 	with	six	 beard 	 ed 	 	men	 pull 	 ed 	 	up	and	 start 	 ed 	 	 interrog 	 ating 	 	her	on	the	spot	for	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	a	man	who	was	n't	related	to	her	.
and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	 student 	 s 	 	in	kuwait	where	they	thought	these	 incident 	 s 	 	took	place	.
the	first	one	,	they	 s 	 aid 	 	saudi	arabia	.	there	was	no	debate	.
the	second	one	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	split	between	saudi	and	afghanistan	.
what	 ble 	 w 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	mind	was	the	first	one	took	place	in	india	,	it	was	the	party	of	a	hindu	god	.
the	second	one	took	place	in	 up 	 state 	 	new	york	.
it	was	an	orthodox	jewish	community	.
but	what	 break 	 s 	 	my	heart	and	what	's	 alarm 	 ing 	 	is	that	in	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 interview 	 s 	 	,	the	people	around	,	who	 we 	 re 	 	 interview 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	refer	to	that	behavior	 a 	 s 	 	talibanization	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	good	hindus	and	good	jews	do	n't	act	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	islam	's	influence	on	hinduism	and	judaism	.
but	what	do	the	 student 	 s 	 	in	kuwait	say	?	they	 s 	 aid 	 	it	's	us	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
it	's	 danger 	 ous 	 	when	a	group	self	-	 ident 	 ifies 	 	 it 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	my	 son 	 s 	 	,	rayan	,	who	's	a	scooby	doo	addict	.
you	can	tell	by	the	 glass 	 es 	 	there	.
he	 actual 	 ly 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	me	a	 meddl 	 ing 	 	kid	the	other	day	.
but	i	borrow	a	 less 	 on 	 	that	i	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	him	.
last	summer	when	we	 we 	 re 	 	in	our	home	in	new	york	,	he	was	out	in	the	yard	 play 	 ing 	 	in	his	 play 	 house 	 	.	and	i	was	in	my	 off 	 ice 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	,	and	he	came	in	,	``	baba	,	i	want	you	to	come	with	me	.	i	want	my	 to 	 y 	 	.	``
``	 y 	 es 	 	,	rayan	,	just	go	away	.	``	he	left	his	scooby	doo	in	his	house	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	go	away	.	i	'm	 work 	 ing 	 	.	i	'm	 bus 	 y 	 	.	``
and	what	rayan	did	then	is	he	 s 	 at 	 	there	,	he	 ta 	 pped 	 	his	foot	on	the	floor	,	at	three	and	a	half	,	and	he	 look 	 ed 	 	at	me	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	baba	,	i	want	you	to	come	with	me	to	my	 off 	 ice 	 	in	my	house	.
i	have	work	to	do	.	``
rayan	 re 	 frame 	 d 	 	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	and	 br 	 ought 	 	 him 	 self 	 	down	to	my	level	.
and	with	the	99	,	that	is	what	we	aim	to	do	.
you	know	,	i	think	that	there	's	a	big	parallel	between	 bend 	 ing 	 	the	crucifix	out	of	shape	and	creating	swastikas	.
and	when	i	see	 picture 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	of	 parent 	 s 	 	or	 uncle 	 s 	 	who	think	it	's	cute	to	have	a	little	child	 hold 	 ing 	 	a	koran	and	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	 su 	 icide 	 	 bomb 	 er 	 	belt	around	them	to	protest	 some 	 thing 	 	,	the	hope	is	by	 link 	 ing 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	positive	 thing 	 s 	 	to	the	koran	,	that	one	day	we	can	move	 th 	 is 	 	child	from	 be 	 ing 	 	proud	in	the	way	they	're	proud	there	,	to	that	.
and	i	think	--	i	think	the	99	can	and	will	 achiev 	 e 	 	 it 	 s 	 	mission	.
 a 	 s 	 	an	 under 	 grad 	 	at	tufts	university	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	giving	away	free	falafel	one	day	and	,	you	know	,	it	was	middle	east	day	or	 some 	 thing 	 	.
and	people	came	up	and	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	the	 cultural 	 ly 	 	 reson 	 ant 	 	image	of	the	falafel	,	ate	it	and	,	you	know	,	 talk 	 ed 	 	and	left	.
and	no	two	people	could	disagree	about	what	the	word	free	was	and	what	the	word	falafel	was	,	 be 	 hind 	 	us	,	``	free	falafel	.	``	you	know	.
or	so	we	thought	,	 un 	 til 	 	a	woman	came	 rush 	 ing 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	campus	and	 drop 	 ped 	 	her	bag	on	the	floor	,	 point 	 ed 	 	up	to	the	sign	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	who	's	falafel	?	``
true	story	.
she	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	coming	out	of	an	amnesty	 inter 	 national 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 	.
just	 to 	 day 	 	,	d.c.	 com 	 ic 	 s 	 	 announce 	 d 	 	the	cover	of	our	 up 	 coming 	 	 cross 	 over 	 	.
on	that	cover	you	see	batman	,	 super 	 man 	 	and	a	fully	-	clothed	wonder	woman	with	our	saudi	member	of	the	99	,	our	emirati	member	and	our	libyan	member	.
on	april	26	,	2010	,	 p 	 resident 	 	barack	obama	 s 	 aid 	 	that	of	all	the	 initi 	 ative 	 s 	 	since	his	now	famous	cairo	speech	--	in	which	he	 reach 	 ed 	 	out	to	the	muslim	world	--	the	most	 innov 	 ative 	 	was	that	the	99	reach	back	out	to	the	justice	league	of	america	.
we	live	in	a	world	in	which	the	most	 cultural 	 ly 	 	 innoc 	 uous 	 	 symbol 	 s 	 	,	like	the	falafel	,	can	be	 mis 	 under 	 stood 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 bag 	 g 	 age 	 	,	and	where	 relig 	 ion 	 	can	be	 twist 	 ed 	 	and	 purpose 	 fully 	 	made	where	it	's	not	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	by	 other 	 s 	 	.
in	a	world	like	that	,	they	'll	 al 	 ways 	 	be	a	job	for	 super 	 man 	 	and	the	99	.
thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
