it	is	a	thrill	to	be	here	at	a	 con 	 ference 	 	that	's	 devote 	 d 	 	to	``	inspired	by	nature	``	--	you	can	imagine	.
and	i	'm	 al 	 so 	 	 thrill 	 ed 	 	to	be	in	the	 fore 	 play 	 	section	.
did	you	notice	 th 	 is 	 	section	is	 fore 	 play 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	i	get	to	talk	about	one	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 critter 	 s 	 	,	which	is	the	western	grebe	.	you	have	n't	lived	 un 	 til 	 	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	these	 guy 	 s 	 	do	 the 	 ir 	 	 court 	 ship 	 	dance	.
i	was	on	bowman	lake	in	 glaci 	 er 	 	national	park	,	which	is	a	long	,	 skin 	 ny 	 	lake	with	sort	of	 mountain 	 s 	 	 up 	 side 	 	down	in	it	,	and	my	partner	and	i	have	a	 row 	 ing 	 	shell	.
and	so	we	 we 	 re 	 	 row 	 ing 	 	,	and	one	of	these	western	grebes	came	 a 	 long 	 	.
and	what	they	do	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 court 	 ship 	 	dance	is	,	they	go	together	,	the	two	of	them	,	the	two	 mate 	 s 	 	,	and	they	begin	to	run	 under 	 water 	 	.
they	 padd 	 le 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	,	and	 fast 	 er 	 	,	and	 fast 	 er 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	they	're	going	so	fast	that	they	 liter 	 ally 	 	lift	up	out	of	the	water	,	and	they	're	 stand 	 ing 	 	 up 	 right 	 	,	sort	of	 padd 	 ling 	 	the	top	of	the	water	.
and	one	of	these	grebes	came	 a 	 long 	 	while	we	 we 	 re 	 	 row 	 ing 	 	.
and	so	we	're	in	a	skull	,	and	we	're	moving	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
and	 th 	 is 	 	grebe	,	i	think	,	sort	of	,	 mistak 	 ed 	 	us	for	a	prospect	,	and	 start 	 ed 	 	to	run	 a 	 long 	 	the	water	next	to	us	,	in	a	 court 	 ship 	 	dance	--	for	 mile 	 s 	 	.
it	would	stop	,	and	then	start	,	and	then	stop	,	and	then	start	.
now	that	is	 fore 	 play 	 	.
i	came	 th 	 is 	 	close	to	changing	species	at	that	moment	.
 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	life	can	teach	us	 some 	 thing 	 	in	the	 entertain 	 ment 	 	section	.	life	 ha 	 s 	 	a	lot	to	teach	us	.
but	what	i	'd	like	to	talk	about	 to 	 day 	 	is	what	life	might	teach	us	in	technology	and	in	design	.
what	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	since	the	book	came	out	--	the	book	was	 main 	 ly 	 	about	research	in	 bio 	 mimicry 	 	--	and	what	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	since	then	is	 architect 	 s 	 	,	 design 	 ers 	 	,	 engineer 	 s 	 	--	people	who	make	our	world	--	have	 start 	 ed 	 	to	call	and	say	,	we	want	a	biologist	to	 s 	 it 	 	at	the	design	table	to	help	us	,	in	real	time	,	 be 	 come 	 	inspired	.
or	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 f 	 un 	 	part	for	me	--	we	want	you	to	take	us	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	natural	world	.	we	'll	come	with	a	design	 challeng 	 e 	 	and	we	find	the	champion	 adapt 	 ers 	 	in	the	natural	world	,	who	might	inspire	us	.
so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	from	a	galapagos	trip	that	we	took	with	some	 waste 	 water 	 	 treat 	 ment 	 	 engineer 	 s 	 	;	they	 pur 	 ify 	 	 waste 	 water 	 	.
and	some	of	them	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	resistant	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	to	 be 	 ing 	 	there	.
what	they	 s 	 aid 	 	to	us	at	first	was	,	you	know	,	we	 al 	 ready 	 	do	 bio 	 mimicry 	 	.
we	use	bacteria	to	clean	our	water	.	and	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	well	,	that	's	not	 exact 	 ly 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	inspired	by	nature	.
that	's	 bio 	 process 	 ing 	 	,	you	know	;	that	's	bio	-	 assist 	 ed 	 	technology	:	using	an	organism	to	do	your	 waste 	 water 	 	 treat 	 ment 	 	is	an	old	,	old	technology	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 domestic 	 ation 	 	.	``
 th 	 is 	 	is	 learn 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	,	 learn 	 ing 	 	an	idea	,	from	an	organism	and	then	 app 	 ly 	 ing 	 	it	.
and	so	they	still	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 get 	 ting 	 	it	.
so	we	went	for	a	walk	on	the	beach	and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	well	,	give	me	one	of	your	big	 problem 	 s 	 	.	give	me	a	design	 challeng 	 e 	 	,	 sustain 	 ability 	 	speed	bump	,	that	's	 keep 	 ing 	 	you	from	 be 	 ing 	 	 sustain 	 able 	 	.
and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	 scal 	 ing 	 	,	which	is	the	build	-	up	of	 mineral 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	of	 pipe 	 s 	 	.
and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	you	know	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	,	mineral	--	just	like	at	your	house	--	mineral	 build 	 s 	 	up	.
and	then	the	aperture	 close 	 s 	 	,	and	we	have	to	flush	the	 pipe 	 s 	 	with	 toxin 	 s 	 	,	or	we	have	to	dig	them	up	.
so	if	we	had	some	way	to	stop	 th 	 is 	 	 scal 	 ing 	 	--	and	so	i	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	some	 shell 	 s 	 	on	the	beach	.	and	i	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	,	what	is	 scal 	 ing 	 	?	what	's	 in 	 side 	 	your	 pipe 	 s 	 	?
and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 calc 	 ium 	 	 carbon 	 ate 	 	.
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	that	's	what	 th 	 is 	 	is	;	 th 	 is 	 	is	 calc 	 ium 	 	 carbon 	 ate 	 	.
and	they	did	n't	know	that	.
they	did	n't	know	that	what	a	 sea 	 shell 	 	is	,	it	's	 template 	 d 	 	by	 protein 	 s 	 	,	and	then	ions	from	the	 sea 	 water 	 	 crystall 	 ize 	 	in	place	to	create	a	shell	.
so	the	same	sort	of	a	process	,	 with 	 out 	 	the	 protein 	 s 	 	,	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	on	the	 in 	 side 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 pipe 	 s 	 	.	they	did	n't	know	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	for	lack	of	information	;	it	's	a	lack	of	 integ 	 ration 	 	.
you	know	,	it	's	a	 s 	 ilo 	 	,	people	in	 s 	 ilo 	 s 	 	.	they	did	n't	know	that	the	same	thing	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	.	so	one	of	them	thought	about	it	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	ok	,	well	,	if	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	 crystall 	 ization 	 	that	 happen 	 s 	 	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	out	of	 sea 	 water 	 	--	self	-	 assem 	 bly 	 	--	then	why	are	n't	 shell 	 s 	 	infinite	in	 s 	 ize 	 	?	what	 stop 	 s 	 	the	 scal 	 ing 	 	?
why	do	n't	they	just	keep	on	going	?
and	i	 s 	 aid 	 	,	well	,	in	the	same	way	that	they	exude	a	protein	and	it	 start 	 s 	 	the	 crystall 	 ization 	 	--	and	then	they	all	sort	of	 lean 	 ed 	 	in	--	they	let	go	of	a	protein	that	 stop 	 s 	 	the	 crystall 	 ization 	 	.
it	 liter 	 ally 	 	 adhere 	 s 	 	to	the	growing	face	of	the	crystal	.
and	,	in	fact	,	there	is	a	product	 call 	 ed 	 	tpa	that	's	 mimic 	 ked 	 	that	protein	--	that	stop	-	protein	--	and	it	's	an	 environment 	 ally 	 	friendly	way	to	stop	 scal 	 ing 	 	in	 pipe 	 s 	 	.
that	 change 	 d 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	.	from	then	on	,	you	could	not	get	these	 engineer 	 s 	 	back	in	the	boat	.
the	first	day	they	would	take	a	 hik 	 e 	 	,	and	it	was	,	click	,	click	,	click	,	click	.	five	 minute 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	back	in	the	boat	.
we	're	 d 	 one 	 	.	you	know	,	i	've	 s 	 een 	 	that	 is 	 land 	 	.
after	 th 	 is 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 crawl 	 ing 	 	all	over	.	they	would	snorkel	for	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	we	would	let	them	snorkel	.
what	had	 happen 	 ed 	 	was	that	they	 real 	 ized 	 	that	there	 we 	 re 	 	 organism 	 s 	 	out	there	that	had	 al 	 ready 	 	 solve 	 d 	 	the	 problem 	 s 	 	that	they	had	 s 	 pent 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 care 	 ers 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	solve	.
 learn 	 ing 	 	about	the	natural	world	is	one	thing	;	 learn 	 ing 	 	from	the	natural	world	--	that	's	the	 s 	 witch 	 	.
that	's	the	 pro 	 found 	 	 s 	 witch 	 	.
what	they	 real 	 ized 	 	was	that	the	 answer 	 s 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 question 	 s 	 	are	 every 	 where 	 	;	they	just	 need 	 ed 	 	to	change	the	 lens 	 es 	 	with	which	they	saw	the	world	.
3.8	billion	 year 	 s 	 	of	field	-	 test 	 ing 	 	.
10	to	30	--	craig	venter	will	 prob 	 ably 	 	tell	you	;	i	think	there	's	a	lot	more	than	30	million	--	well	-	 adapt 	 ed 	 	 solution 	 s 	 	.
the	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	for	me	is	that	these	are	 solution 	 s 	 	 solve 	 d 	 	in	 con 	 text 	 	.
and	the	 con 	 text 	 	is	the	earth	--	the	same	 con 	 text 	 	that	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	solve	our	 problem 	 s 	 	in	.
so	it	's	the	conscious	 emul 	 ation 	 	of	life	's	 gen 	 ius 	 	.
it	's	not	 s 	 lavish 	 ly 	 	 mimic 	 king 	 	--	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	al	is	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	the	 hair 	 do 	 	going	--	it	's	not	a	 s 	 lavish 	 	mimicry	;	it	's	taking	the	design	 principle 	 s 	 	,	the	 gen 	 ius 	 	of	the	natural	world	,	and	 learn 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	from	it	.
now	,	in	a	group	with	so	 man 	 y 	 	it	people	,	i	do	have	to	 ment 	 ion 	 	what	i	'm	not	going	to	talk	about	,	and	that	is	that	your	field	is	one	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	an	enormous	amount	from	living	 thing 	 s 	 	,	on	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	side	.	so	there	's	 computer 	 s 	 	that	protect	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	like	an	 immun 	 e 	 	system	,	and	we	're	 learn 	 ing 	 	from	gene	 regulat 	 ion 	 	and	 bio 	 logical 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	.	and	we	're	 learn 	 ing 	 	from	neural	 net 	 s 	 	,	genetic	 algorithm 	 s 	 	,	 evolution 	 ary 	 	computing	.
that	's	on	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	side	.	but	what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	me	is	that	we	have	n't	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	much	.	i	mean	,	these	 machine 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	not	 ver 	 y 	 	high	tech	in	my	estimation	in	the	sense	that	there	's	 dozen 	 s 	 	and	 dozen 	 s 	 	of	 carcinogen 	 s 	 	in	the	water	in	silicon	 val 	 ley 	 	.
so	the	 hard 	 ware 	 	is	not	at	all	up	to	snuff	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	what	life	would	call	a	success	.
so	what	can	we	learn	about	making	--	not	just	 computer 	 s 	 	,	but	 every 	 thing 	 	?
the	plane	you	came	in	,	 car 	 s 	 	,	the	 seat 	 s 	 	that	you	're	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	on	.
how	do	we	 re 	 design 	 	the	world	that	we	make	,	the	human	-	made	world	?
more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	what	should	we	ask	in	the	next	10	 year 	 s 	 	?
and	there	's	a	lot	of	cool	 techno 	 logies 	 	out	there	that	life	 ha 	 s 	 	.
what	's	the	syllabus	?
three	 question 	 s 	 	,	for	me	,	are	key	.
how	 do 	 es 	 	life	make	 thing 	 s 	 	?
 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	;	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	we	make	 thing 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	heat	,	beat	and	treat	--	that	's	what	material	 scientist 	 s 	 	call	it	.
and	it	's	 carv 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	down	from	the	top	,	with	96	percent	waste	left	over	and	 on 	 ly 	 	4	percent	product	.	you	heat	it	up	;	you	beat	it	with	high	 pressure 	 s 	 	;	you	use	 chemical 	 s 	 	.	ok	.	heat	,	beat	and	treat	.
life	ca	n't	afford	to	do	that	.	how	 do 	 es 	 	life	make	 thing 	 s 	 	?
how	 do 	 es 	 	life	make	the	most	of	 thing 	 s 	 	?
that	's	a	 ger 	 an 	 ium 	 	 poll 	 en 	 	.
and	 it 	 s 	 	shape	is	what	 give 	 s 	 	it	the	function	of	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	tumble	through	air	so	 eas 	 ily 	 	.	look	at	that	shape	.
life	 add 	 s 	 	information	to	matter	.
in	other	 word 	 s 	 	:	structure	.
it	 give 	 s 	 	it	information	.	by	 add 	 ing 	 	information	to	matter	,	it	 give 	 s 	 	it	a	function	that	's	different	than	 with 	 out 	 	that	structure	.
and	 third 	 ly 	 	,	how	 do 	 es 	 	life	make	 thing 	 s 	 	disappear	 in 	 to 	 	 system 	 s 	 	?
 be 	 cause 	 	life	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	deal	in	 thing 	 s 	 	;	there	are	no	 thing 	 s 	 	in	the	natural	world	 divorce 	 d 	 	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 system 	 s 	 	.
 re 	 ally 	 	quick	syllabus	.
 a 	 s 	 	i	'm	 read 	 ing 	 	more	and	more	now	,	and	 follow 	 ing 	 	the	story	,	there	are	some	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	coming	up	in	the	 bio 	 logical 	 	 science 	 s 	 	.
and	at	the	same	time	,	i	'm	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	a	lot	of	 business 	 es 	 	and	 find 	 ing 	 	what	 the 	 ir 	 	sort	of	grand	 challeng 	 es 	 	are	.
the	two	 group 	 s 	 	are	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	each	other	.
at	all	.
what	in	the	world	of	biology	might	be	 help 	 ful 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	juncture	,	to	get	us	through	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 knot 	 hole 	 	that	we	're	in	?
i	'm	going	to	try	to	go	through	12	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
one	that	's	 excit 	 ing 	 	to	me	is	self	-	 assem 	 bly 	 	.
now	,	you	've	heard	about	 th 	 is 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 nano 	 technology 	 	.
back	to	that	shell	:	the	shell	is	a	self	-	 assem 	 bling 	 	material	.
on	the	lower	left	there	is	a	picture	of	mother	of	pearl	 form 	 ing 	 	out	of	 sea 	 water 	 	.	it	's	a	 layer 	 ed 	 	structure	that	's	mineral	and	then	polymer	,	and	it	 make 	 s 	 	it	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	tough	.
it	's	twice	 a 	 s 	 	tough	 a 	 s 	 	our	high	-	tech	 ceramic 	 s 	 	.
but	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	:	 un 	 like 	 	our	 ceramic 	 s 	 	that	are	in	 kiln 	 s 	 	,	it	 happen 	 s 	 	in	 sea 	 water 	 	.	it	 happen 	 s 	 	near	,	in	and	near	,	the	organism	's	body	.

what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	is	that	it	self	-	assembles	.
a	woman	named	joanna	aizenberg	,	at	lucent	,	is	now	 learn 	 ing 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	in	a	low	-	temperature	process	to	create	these	sort	of	 lens 	 es 	 	.	she	's	 al 	 so 	 	looking	at	fiber	 optic 	 s 	 	.
