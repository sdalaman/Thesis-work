 th 	 is 	 	is	revolution	2.0	.
no	one	was	a	hero	.	no	one	was	a	hero	.
 be 	 cause 	 	 every 	 one 	 	was	a	hero	.
 every 	 one 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	.
we	all	use	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	.
if	you	think	of	the	 con 	 cept 	 	of	 wiki 	 pedia 	 	where	 every 	 one 	 	is	 collabor 	 ating 	 	on	content	,	and	at	the	end	of	the	day	you	've	built	the	largest	encyclopedia	in	the	world	.
from	just	an	idea	that	 sound 	 ed 	 	crazy	,	you	have	the	largest	encyclopedia	in	the	world	.
and	in	the	egyptian	revolution	,	the	revolution	2.0	,	 every 	 one 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 con 	 tribute 	 d 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	,	small	or	big	.	they	 con 	 tribute 	 d 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	--	to	 br 	 ing 	 	us	one	of	the	most	inspiring	 st 	 ories 	 	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 man 	 kind 	 	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	 revolution 	 s 	 	.
it	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	inspiring	to	see	all	these	egyptians	 complete 	 ly 	 	changing	.
if	you	look	at	the	scene	,	egypt	,	for	30	 year 	 s 	 	,	had	 be 	 en 	 	in	a	 down 	 hill 	 	--	going	 in 	 to 	 	a	 down 	 hill 	 	.
 every 	 thing 	 	was	going	bad	.
 every 	 thing 	 	was	going	wrong	.
we	 on 	 ly 	 	 rank 	 ed 	 	high	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	poverty	,	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	,	lack	of	 free 	 dom 	 	of	speech	,	lack	of	 politic 	 al 	 	 activ 	 ism 	 	.
 t 	 hose 	 	 we 	 re 	 	the	 achiev 	 ement 	 s 	 	of	our	great	regime	.
yet	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
and	it	's	not	 be 	 cause 	 	people	 we 	 re 	 	happy	or	people	 we 	 re 	 	not	 frust 	 rated 	 	.
in	fact	,	people	 we 	 re 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 frust 	 rated 	 	.
but	the	reason	why	 every 	 one 	 	was	silent	is	what	i	call	the	 psycho 	 logical 	 	 bar 	 rier 	 	of	fear	.
 every 	 one 	 	was	 scar 	 ed 	 	.
not	 every 	 one 	 	.	there	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	few	brave	egyptians	that	i	have	to	thank	for	 be 	 ing 	 	so	brave	--	going	 in 	 to 	 	 protest 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	couple	of	hundred	,	 get 	 ting 	 	 beat 	 en 	 	up	and	 arrest 	 ed 	 	.
but	in	fact	,	the	 major 	 ity 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 scar 	 ed 	 	.
 every 	 one 	 	did	not	want	 re 	 ally 	 	to	get	in	trouble	.
a	dictator	can	not	live	 with 	 out 	 	the	force	.
they	want	to	make	people	live	in	fear	.
and	that	 psycho 	 logical 	 	 bar 	 rier 	 	of	fear	had	 work 	 ed 	 	for	so	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	here	 come 	 s 	 	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	technology	,	 black 	 berry 	 	,	sms	.
it	's	 help 	 ing 	 	all	of	us	to	connect	.
 platform 	 s 	 	like	youtube	,	twitter	,	facebook	 we 	 re 	 	 help 	 ing 	 	us	a	lot	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 bas 	 ically 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	us	the	impression	that	,	``	 w 	 ow 	 	,	i	'm	not	 al 	 one 	 	.
there	are	a	lot	of	people	who	are	 frust 	 rated 	 	.	``
there	are	 lot 	 s 	 	of	people	who	are	 frust 	 rated 	 	.
there	are	 lot 	 s 	 	of	people	who	 actual 	 ly 	 	share	the	same	dream	.
there	are	 lot 	 s 	 	of	people	who	care	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 free 	 dom 	 	.
they	 prob 	 ably 	 	have	the	best	life	in	the	world	.
they	are	living	in	happiness	.	they	are	living	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 villa 	 s 	 	.
they	are	happy	.	they	do	n't	have	 problem 	 s 	 	.
but	they	are	still	 feel 	 ing 	 	the	pain	of	the	egyptian	.
a	lot	of	us	,	we	're	not	 re 	 ally 	 	happy	when	we	see	a	video	of	an	egyptian	man	who	's	eating	the	trash	while	 other 	 s 	 	are	 steal 	 ing 	 	 billion 	 s 	 	of	egyptian	 pound 	 s 	 	from	the	wealth	of	the	country	.
the	 inter 	 net 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 play 	 ed 	 	a	great	role	,	 help 	 ing 	 	these	people	to	speak	up	 the 	 ir 	 	 mind 	 s 	 	,	to	 collabor 	 ate 	 	together	,	to	start	 think 	 ing 	 	together	.
it	was	an	 education 	 al 	 	campaign	.
khaled	saeed	was	 kill 	 ed 	 	in	june	2010	.
i	still	remember	the	photo	.
i	still	remember	every	single	detail	of	that	photo	.
the	photo	was	 horr 	 ible 	 	.
he	was	 torture 	 d 	 	,	 brutal 	 ly 	 	 torture 	 d 	 	to	death	.
but	then	what	was	the	answer	of	the	regime	?
``	he	 choke 	 d 	 	on	a	pile	of	hash	``	--	that	was	 the 	 ir 	 	answer	:	``	he	's	a	criminal	.
he	's	 some 	 one 	 	who	 es 	 cap 	 ed 	 	from	all	these	bad	 thing 	 s 	 	.	``
but	people	did	not	 re 	 late 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
people	did	not	 believ 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	the	truth	 prevail 	 ed 	 	and	 every 	 one 	 	 k 	 new 	 	the	truth	.
and	 every 	 one 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	to	think	that	``	 th 	 is 	 	guy	could	be	my	brother	.	``
he	was	a	middle	-	class	guy	.
his	photo	was	 remember 	 ed 	 	by	all	of	us	.
a	page	was	 create 	 d 	 	.
an	 anonym 	 ous 	 	 administr 	 ator 	 	was	 bas 	 ically 	 	 invit 	 ing 	 	people	to	join	the	page	,	and	there	was	no	plan	.
``	what	are	we	going	to	do	?	``	``	i	do	n't	know	.	``
in	a	few	 day 	 s 	 	,	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	there	--	 ang 	 ry 	 	egyptians	who	 we 	 re 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	the	 mini 	 stry 	 	of	 in 	 terior 	 	 af 	 fair 	 s 	 	,	``	 en 	 ough 	 	.
get	 t 	 hose 	 	who	 kill 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	guy	.
to	just	 br 	 ing 	 	them	to	justice	.	``
but	of	course	,	they	do	n't	listen	.
it	was	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	story	--	how	 every 	 one 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	the	 owner 	 ship 	 	.
 every 	 one 	 	was	an	owner	in	 th 	 is 	 	page	.
people	 start 	 ed 	 	 con 	 trib 	 uting 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	.
in	fact	,	one	of	the	most	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	was	,	``	 he 	 y 	 	,	let	's	have	a	silent	stand	.
let	's	get	people	to	go	in	the	street	,	face	the	sea	,	 the 	 ir 	 	back	to	the	street	,	 dress 	 ed 	 	in	black	,	 stand 	 ing 	 	up	 silent 	 ly 	 	for	one	hour	,	 do 	 ing 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	and	then	just	 leav 	 ing 	 	,	going	back	home	.	``
for	some	people	,	that	was	like	,	``	 w 	 ow 	 	,	silent	stand	.
and	next	time	it	's	going	to	be	vibration	.	``
people	 we 	 re 	 	making	 f 	 un 	 	of	the	idea	.
but	 actual 	 ly 	 	when	people	went	to	the	street	--	the	first	time	it	was	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	in	alexandria	--	it	felt	like	--	it	was	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.	it	was	great	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 connect 	 ed 	 	people	from	the	virtual	world	,	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	them	to	the	real	world	,	sharing	the	same	dream	,	the	same	 frust 	 ration 	 	,	the	same	anger	,	the	same	 desir 	 e 	 	for	 free 	 dom 	 	.
and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	thing	.
but	did	the	regime	learn	 any 	 thing 	 	?	not	 re 	 ally 	 	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 attack 	 ing 	 	them	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ab 	 using 	 	them	,	 de 	 spite 	 	the	fact	of	how	 peace 	 ful 	 	these	 guy 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	--	they	 we 	 re 	 	not	even	 protest 	 ing 	 	.
and	 thing 	 s 	 	had	 develop 	 ed 	 	 un 	 til 	 	the	tunisian	revolution	.
 th 	 is 	 	whole	page	was	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 manage 	 d 	 	by	the	people	.
in	fact	,	the	 anonym 	 ous 	 	 ad 	 min 	 	job	was	to	collect	 idea 	 s 	 	,	help	people	to	vote	on	them	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	tell	them	what	they	are	 do 	 ing 	 	.
people	 we 	 re 	 	taking	 shot 	 s 	 	and	 photo 	 s 	 	;	people	 we 	 re 	 	 report 	 ing 	 	 viol 	 ations 	 	of	human	 right 	 s 	 	in	egypt	;	people	 we 	 re 	 	 suggest 	 ing 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 vot 	 ing 	 	on	 idea 	 s 	 	,	and	then	they	 we 	 re 	 	 exec 	 uting 	 	the	 idea 	 s 	 	;	people	 we 	 re 	 	creating	 video 	 s 	 	.
 every 	 thing 	 	was	 d 	 one 	 	by	the	people	to	the	people	,	and	that	's	the	power	of	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
there	was	no	 lead 	 er 	 	.
the	 lead 	 er 	 	was	 every 	 one 	 	on	that	page	.
the	tunisian	experiment	,	 a 	 s 	 	amir	was	 say 	 ing 	 	,	inspired	all	of	us	,	 show 	 ed 	 	us	that	there	is	a	way	.
 y 	 es 	 	we	can	.	we	can	do	it	.
we	have	the	same	 problem 	 s 	 	;	we	can	just	go	in	the	 street 	 s 	 	.
and	when	i	saw	the	street	on	the	25th	,	i	went	back	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	egypt	before	the	25th	is	never	going	to	be	egypt	after	the	25th	.
the	revolution	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	not	the	end	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	end	.	``
i	was	 de 	 tain 	 ed 	 	on	the	27th	night	.
thank	god	i	 announce 	 d 	 	the	 location 	 s 	 	and	 every 	 thing 	 	.
but	they	 de 	 tain 	 ed 	 	me	.
and	i	'm	not	going	to	talk	about	my	experience	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	about	me	.
i	was	 de 	 tain 	 ed 	 	for	12	 day 	 s 	 	,	 blind 	 fold 	 ed 	 	,	 hand 	 cuff 	 ed 	 	.
and	i	did	not	 re 	 ally 	 	hear	 any 	 thing 	 	.	i	did	not	know	 any 	 thing 	 	.
i	was	not	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	speak	with	 any 	 one 	 	.
and	i	went	out	.
the	next	day	i	was	in	tahrir	.
 serious 	 ly 	 	,	with	the	amount	of	change	i	had	 notice 	 d 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	square	,	i	thought	it	was	12	 year 	 s 	 	.
i	never	had	in	my	mind	to	see	 th 	 is 	 	egyptian	,	the	 amaz 	 ing 	 	egyptian	.
the	fear	is	no	 long 	 er 	 	fear	.
it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	strength	--	it	's	power	.
people	 we 	 re 	 	so	 empower 	 ed 	 	.
it	was	 amaz 	 ing 	 	how	 every 	 one 	 	was	so	 empower 	 ed 	 	and	now	 ask 	 ing 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 right 	 s 	 	.
 complete 	 ly 	 	 oppos 	 ite 	 	.
 extrem 	 ism 	 	 be 	 came 	 	 toler 	 ance 	 	.
who	would	[	have	]	 imagin 	 ed 	 	before	the	25th	,	if	i	tell	you	that	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	christians	are	going	to	pray	and	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	muslims	are	going	to	protect	them	,	and	then	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	muslims	are	going	to	pray	and	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	christians	are	going	to	protect	them	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
all	the	 stereo 	 type 	 s 	 	that	the	regime	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	put	on	us	through	 the 	 ir 	 	so	-	 call 	 ed 	 	 propag 	 and 	 a 	 	,	or	 main 	 stream 	 	media	,	are	proven	wrong	.
 th 	 is 	 	whole	revolution	 show 	 ed 	 	us	how	 ug 	 ly 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	a	regime	was	and	how	great	and	 amaz 	 ing 	 	the	egyptian	man	,	the	egyptian	woman	,	how	simple	and	 amaz 	 ing 	 	these	people	are	 when 	 ever 	 	they	have	a	dream	.
when	i	saw	that	,	i	went	back	and	i	wrote	on	facebook	.
and	that	was	a	personal	belief	,	 regard 	 less 	 	of	what	's	going	on	,	 regard 	 less 	 	of	the	 detail 	 s 	 	.
i	 s 	 aid 	 	that	,	``	we	are	going	to	win	.
we	are	going	to	win	 be 	 cause 	 	we	do	n't	understand	 politic 	 s 	 	.
we	're	going	to	win	 be 	 cause 	 	we	do	n't	play	 the 	 ir 	 	 dirt 	 y 	 	 game 	 s 	 	.
we	're	going	to	win	 be 	 cause 	 	we	do	n't	have	an	agenda	.

we	're	going	to	win	 be 	 cause 	 	we	are	 will 	 ing 	 	to	stand	up	for	our	 dream 	 s 	 	.	``
and	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	.	we	won	.
and	that	's	not	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 any 	 thing 	 	,	but	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 believ 	 ed 	 	in	our	dream	.
the	winning	here	is	not	the	whole	 detail 	 s 	 	of	what	's	going	to	happen	in	the	 politic 	 al 	 	scene	.
the	winning	is	the	winning	of	the	dignity	of	every	single	egyptian	.
 actual 	 ly 	 	,	i	had	 th 	 is 	 	taxi	driver	 tell 	 ing 	 	me	,	``	listen	,	i	am	 breath 	 ing 	 	 free 	 dom 	 	.
i	feel	that	i	have	dignity	that	i	have	lost	for	so	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	.	``
for	me	that	's	winning	,	 regard 	 less 	 	of	all	the	 detail 	 s 	 	.
my	last	word	to	you	is	a	 state 	 ment 	 	i	 believ 	 e 	 	in	,	which	egyptians	have	proven	to	be	true	,	that	the	power	of	the	people	is	much	 strong 	 er 	 	than	the	people	in	power	.
