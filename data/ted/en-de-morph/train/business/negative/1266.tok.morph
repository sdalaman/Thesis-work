i	'd	like	to	start	with	a	short	story	.
it	's	about	a	little	boy	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	father	was	a	 histo 	 ry 	 	buff	and	who	used	to	take	him	by	the	hand	to	visit	the	 ruin 	 s 	 	of	an	ancient	 metro 	 poli 	 s 	 	on	the	 out 	 skirt 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	camp	.
they	would	 al 	 ways 	 	stop	by	to	visit	these	huge	 wing 	 ed 	 	 bull 	 s 	 	that	used	to	guard	the	 gate 	 s 	 	of	that	ancient	 metro 	 poli 	 s 	 	,	and	the	boy	used	to	be	 scar 	 ed 	 	of	these	 wing 	 ed 	 	 bull 	 s 	 	,	but	at	the	same	time	they	 excit 	 ed 	 	him	.
and	the	dad	used	to	use	 t 	 hose 	 	 bull 	 s 	 	to	tell	the	boy	 st 	 ories 	 	about	that	 civil 	 ization 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	work	.
let	's	fast	-	forward	to	the	san	francisco	 ba 	 y 	 	area	 man 	 y 	 	 decade 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	where	i	 start 	 ed 	 	a	technology	company	that	 br 	 ought 	 	the	world	 it 	 s 	 	first	3d	laser	 s 	 canning 	 	system	.
let	me	show	you	how	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
female	voice	:	long	range	laser	 s 	 canning 	 	by	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	out	a	 puls 	 e 	 	that	's	a	laser	beam	of	light	.
the	system	 measure 	 s 	 	the	beam	's	time	of	flight	,	 record 	 ing 	 	the	time	it	 take 	 s 	 	for	the	light	to	hit	a	surface	and	make	 it 	 s 	 	return	.
with	two	 mirror 	 s 	 	,	the	scanner	 calcul 	 ates 	 	the	beam	's	 horizon 	 tal 	 	and	 vert 	 ical 	 	 angle 	 s 	 	,	giving	accurate	x	,	y	,	and	z	 coordinate 	 s 	 	.
the	point	is	then	 record 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	3d	 visual 	 ization 	 	program	.
all	of	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	in	 second 	 s 	 	.
ben	kacyra	:	you	can	see	here	,	these	 system 	 s 	 	are	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	fast	.
they	collect	 million 	 s 	 	of	 point 	 s 	 	at	a	time	with	 ver 	 y 	 	high	 accu 	 racy 	 	and	 ver 	 y 	 	high	 re 	 solution 	 	.
a	 survey 	 or 	 	with	 tradition 	 al 	 	survey	 tool 	 s 	 	would	be	hard	-	 press 	 ed 	 	to	produce	 may 	 be 	 	500	 point 	 s 	 	in	a	whole	day	.
these	 bab 	 ies 	 	would	be	producing	 some 	 thing 	 	like	ten	thousand	 point 	 s 	 	a	second	.
so	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	imagine	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	paradigm	shift	in	the	survey	and	construction	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	in	 re 	 ality 	 	capture	industry	.
 approximate 	 ly 	 	ten	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	my	wife	and	i	 start 	 ed 	 	a	 found 	 ation 	 	to	do	good	,	and	right	about	that	time	,	the	 magnific 	 ent 	 	bamiyan	buddhas	,	hundred	and	 eight 	 y 	 	foot	tall	in	afghanistan	,	 we 	 re 	 	blown	up	by	the	taliban	.
they	 we 	 re 	 	gone	in	an	instant	.
and	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	there	was	no	 detail 	 ed 	 	 document 	 ation 	 	of	these	buddhas	.
 th 	 is 	 	 clear 	 ly 	 	 deva 	 state 	 d 	 	me	,	and	i	could	n't	help	but	wonder	about	the	fate	of	my	old	 friend 	 s 	 	,	the	 wing 	 ed 	 	 bull 	 s 	 	,	and	the	fate	of	the	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	heritage	 s 	 ites 	 	all	over	the	world	.
both	my	wife	and	i	 we 	 re 	 	so	 touch 	 ed 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	that	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	expand	the	mission	of	our	 found 	 ation 	 	to	include	digital	heritage	 p 	 reservation 	 	of	world	 s 	 ites 	 	.
we	 call 	 ed 	 	the	project	cyark	,	which	 stand 	 s 	 	for	cyber	 archiv 	 e 	 	.
to	date	,	with	the	help	of	a	global	network	of	 partner 	 s 	 	,	we	've	 complete 	 d 	 	close	to	fifty	 project 	 s 	 	.
let	me	show	you	some	of	them	:	chichen	itza	,	rapa	nui	--	and	what	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	here	are	the	cloud	of	 point 	 s 	 	--	babylon	,	rosslyn	 cha 	 pel 	 	,	pompeii	,	and	our	 lat 	 est 	 	project	,	mt	.	rushmore	,	which	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	be	one	of	our	most	 challeng 	 ing 	 	 project 	 s 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	you	see	here	,	we	had	to	develop	a	special	rig	to	 br 	 ing 	 	the	scanner	up	close	and	personal	.
the	 result 	 s 	 	of	our	work	in	the	field	are	used	to	produce	media	and	 deliver 	 able 	 s 	 	to	be	used	by	 conserv 	 ators 	 	and	 research 	 ers 	 	.
we	 al 	 so 	 	produce	media	for	 dis 	 semi 	 nation 	 	to	the	public	--	free	through	the	cyark	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
these	would	be	used	for	education	,	cultural	 tour 	 ism 	 	,	etc	.
what	you	're	looking	at	in	here	is	a	3d	 view 	 er 	 	that	we	 develop 	 ed 	 	that	would	allow	the	 dis 	 play 	 	and	 manipul 	 ation 	 	of	[	the	]	cloud	of	 point 	 s 	 	in	real	time	,	cutting	 section 	 s 	 	through	them	and	 ex 	 tract 	 ing 	 	 dimension 	 s 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	to	be	the	cloud	of	 point 	 s 	 	for	tikal	.
in	here	you	see	a	 tradition 	 al 	 	2d	 architect 	 ural 	 	 engineer 	 ing 	 	 draw 	 ing 	 	that	's	used	for	 p 	 reservation 	 	,	and	of	course	we	tell	the	 st 	 ories 	 	through	fly	-	throughs	.
and	here	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	fly	-	through	the	cloud	of	 point 	 s 	 	of	tikal	,	and	here	you	see	it	 render 	 ed 	 	and	photo	-	textured	with	the	 photograph 	 y 	 	that	we	take	of	the	 s 	 ite 	 	.
and	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	video	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	actual	3d	 point 	 s 	 	with	two	to	three	millimeter	 accu 	 racy 	 	.
and	of	course	the	data	can	be	used	to	develop	3d	 model 	 s 	 	that	are	 ver 	 y 	 	accurate	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 detail 	 ed 	 	.
and	here	you	're	looking	at	a	model	that	's	 extra 	 cted 	 	from	the	cloud	of	 point 	 s 	 	for	stirling	castle	.
it	's	used	for	 stud 	 ies 	 	,	for	 visual 	 ization 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	for	education	.
and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	we	produce	mobile	 app 	 s 	 	that	include	 narrate 	 d 	 	virtual	 tool 	 s 	 	.
the	more	i	got	 involve 	 d 	 	in	the	heritage	field	,	the	more	it	 be 	 came 	 	clear	to	me	that	we	are	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	the	 s 	 ites 	 	and	the	 st 	 ories 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	than	we	can	 physical 	 ly 	 	preserve	them	.
of	course	,	 earth 	 quake 	 s 	 	and	all	the	natural	 phenomen 	 a 	 	--	 flood 	 s 	 	,	 tornado 	 es 	 	,	etc	.	--	take	 the 	 ir 	 	toll	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	what	 occur 	 red 	 	to	me	was	human	-	 caus 	 ed 	 	 destruct 	 ion 	 	,	which	was	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 caus 	 ing 	 	a	significant	 port 	 ion 	 	of	the	 destruct 	 ion 	 	,	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	it	was	 accele 	 rating 	 	.
 th 	 is 	 	 include 	 s 	 	 ar 	 son 	 	,	urban	sprawl	,	acid	rain	,	not	to	 ment 	 ion 	 	 terror 	 ism 	 	and	 war 	 s 	 	.
it	was	 get 	 ting 	 	more	and	more	 ap 	 parent 	 	that	we	're	 fight 	 ing 	 	a	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	battle	.
we	're	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	our	 s 	 ites 	 	and	the	 st 	 ories 	 	,	and	 bas 	 ically 	 	we	're	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	a	piece	--	and	a	significant	piece	--	of	our	 collect 	 ive 	 	 memor 	 y 	 	.
imagine	us	 a 	 s 	 	a	human	race	not	 know 	 ing 	 	where	we	came	from	.
 luck 	 ily 	 	,	in	the	last	two	or	three	 decade 	 s 	 	,	digital	 techno 	 logies 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 develop 	 ing 	 	that	have	 help 	 ed 	 	us	to	develop	 tool 	 s 	 	that	we	've	 br 	 ought 	 	to	bear	in	the	digital	 p 	 reservation 	 	,	in	our	digital	 p 	 reservation 	 	war	.
 th 	 is 	 	 include 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	the	3d	laser	 s 	 canning 	 	 system 	 s 	 	,	ever	more	 power 	 ful 	 	personal	 computer 	 s 	 	,	3d	 graphic 	 s 	 	,	high	-	definition	digital	 photograph 	 y 	 	,	not	to	 ment 	 ion 	 	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
 be 	 cause 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 accele 	 rated 	 	pace	of	 destruct 	 ion 	 	,	it	 be 	 came 	 	clear	to	us	that	we	 need 	 ed 	 	to	 challeng 	 e 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	our	 partner 	 s 	 	to	 accele 	 rate 	 	our	work	.
and	we	 create 	 d 	 	a	project	we	call	the	cyark	500	 challeng 	 e 	 	--	and	that	is	to	 digital 	 ly 	 	preserve	500	world	heritage	 s 	 ites 	 	in	five	 year 	 s 	 	.
we	do	have	the	technology	that	's	 scale 	 able 	 	,	and	our	network	of	global	 partner 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 expand 	 ing 	 	and	can	be	 expand 	 ed 	 	at	a	rapid	rate	,	so	we	're	 comfort 	 able 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	task	can	be	 accomplish 	 ed 	 	.
 how 	 ever 	 	,	to	me	,	the	500	is	 re 	 ally 	 	just	the	first	500	.
in	order	to	sustain	our	work	 in 	 to 	 	the	future	,	we	use	technology	 center 	 s 	 	where	we	partner	with	local	 un 	 ive 	 rs 	 ities 	 	and	 college 	 s 	 	to	take	the	technology	to	them	,	 where 	 by 	 	they	then	can	help	us	with	digital	 p 	 reservation 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	heritage	 s 	 ites 	 	,	and	at	the	same	time	,	it	 give 	 s 	 	them	the	technology	to	benefit	from	in	the	future	.
let	me	close	with	 an 	 other 	 	short	story	.
two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 approach 	 ed 	 	by	a	partner	of	 our 	 s 	 	to	 digital 	 ly 	 	preserve	an	 import 	 ant 	 	heritage	 s 	 ite 	 	,	a	unesco	heritage	 s 	 ite 	 	in	uganda	,	the	royal	kasubi	 tomb 	 s 	 	.
the	work	was	 d 	 one 	 	 success 	 fully 	 	in	the	field	,	and	the	data	was	 archiv 	 ed 	 	and	 public 	 ly 	 	 disseminate 	 d 	 	through	the	cyark	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
last	march	,	we	 receiv 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 ad 	 	news	.
the	royal	 tomb 	 s 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	 destroy 	 ed 	 	by	 suspect 	 ed 	 	 ar 	 son 	 	.
a	few	 day 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	we	 receiv 	 ed 	 	a	call	:	``	is	the	data	 avail 	 able 	 	and	can	it	be	used	for	 re 	 construction 	 	?	``
our	answer	,	of	course	,	was	 y 	 es 	 	.
let	me	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	a	final	thought	.
our	heritage	is	much	more	than	our	 collect 	 ive 	 	 memor 	 y 	 	--	it	's	our	 collect 	 ive 	 	 treasu 	 re 	 	.
we	owe	it	to	our	children	,	our	 grand 	 children 	 	and	the	 generation 	 s 	 	we	will	never	meet	to	keep	it	safe	and	to	pass	it	 a 	 long 	 	.
thank	you	.
thank	you	.
thank	you	.
thank	you	.
well	,	i	'm	 stay 	 ing 	 	here	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 demonst 	 rate 	 	to	you	the	power	of	 th 	 is 	 	technology	and	so	,	while	i	've	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 peaking 	 	,	you	have	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 can 	 ned 	 	.
the	two	 wizard 	 s 	 	that	i	have	that	are	 be 	 hind 	 	the	 cur 	 tain 	 	will	help	me	 br 	 ing 	 	the	 result 	 s 	 	on	the	screen	.
 th 	 is 	 	is	all	in	3d	and	of	course	you	can	fly	through	the	cloud	of	 point 	 s 	 	.
you	can	look	at	it	from	on	top	,	from	the	 ceil 	 ing 	 	.
you	can	look	from	different	 van 	 t 	 age 	 	 point 	 s 	 	,	but	i	'm	going	to	ask	doug	to	zoom	in	on	an	individual	in	the	crowd	,	just	to	show	the	amount	of	detail	that	we	can	create	.
so	you	have	 be 	 en 	 	 digital 	 ly 	 	 preserve 	 d 	 	in	about	four	 minute 	 s 	 	.
i	'd	like	to	thank	the	 wizard 	 s 	 	here	.
we	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	to	have	two	of	our	 partner 	 s 	 	 particip 	 ate 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	:	the	historic	scotland	,	and	the	glasgow	school	of	art	.
i	'd	like	to	 al 	 so 	 	thank	 personal 	 ly 	 	the	 effort 	 s 	 	of	david	mitchell	,	who	is	the	director	of	 conserv 	 ation 	 	at	historic	scotland	.
david	.
and	doug	pritchard	,	who	's	the	head	of	 visual 	 ization 	 	at	the	glasgow	school	of	art	.
let	's	give	them	a	hand	.
