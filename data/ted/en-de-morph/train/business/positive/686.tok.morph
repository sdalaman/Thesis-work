alexander	,	a	young	macedonian	,	met	there	what	he	 call 	 ed 	 	a	``	 gym 	 n 	 osoph 	 ist 	 	,	``	which	 mean 	 s 	 	``	the	naked	,	wise	man	.	``
we	do	n't	know	who	he	was	.
 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	he	was	a	jain	monk	,	like	bahubali	over	here	,	the	gomateshwara	bahubali	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	image	is	not	far	from	mysore	.

what	a	waste	of	a	life	.	``
to	understand	 th 	 is 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	 view 	 point 	 s 	 	,	we	have	to	understand	the	 subject 	 ive 	 	truth	of	alexander	--	his	myth	,	and	the	 mytho 	 logy 	 	that	 construct 	 ed 	 	it	.
alexander	's	mother	,	his	 parent 	 s 	 	,	his	teacher	aristotle	told	him	the	story	of	homer	's	``	iliad	.	``
they	told	him	of	a	great	hero	 call 	 ed 	 	 a 	 chill 	 es 	 	,	who	,	when	he	 particip 	 ated 	 	in	battle	,	 vict 	 ory 	 	was	 assur 	 ed 	 	,	but	when	he	 with 	 drew 	 	from	the	battle	,	defeat	was	 inevit 	 able 	 	.

that	's	what	he	heard	.
``	what	should	you	not	be	?

but	these	are	not	the	 st 	 ories 	 	that	the	 gym 	 n 	 osoph 	 ist 	 	heard	.

bharat	 al 	 so 	 	 conquer 	 ed 	 	the	world	.

but	they	 we 	 re 	 	not	two	 character 	 s 	 	on	two	different	 adventure 	 s 	 	.

when	ram	dies	,	krishna	is	born	.
when	krishna	dies	,	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	he	will	be	back	 a 	 s 	 	ram	.

two	different	 mytho 	 logies 	 	.

two	different	 mytho 	 logies 	 	,	two	different	ways	of	looking	at	the	world	.

the	other	 believ 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	 man 	 y 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
and	so	,	the	 denomi 	 nator 	 	of	alexander	's	life	was	one	.
so	,	the	value	of	his	life	was	the	sum	total	of	his	 achiev 	 ement 	 s 	 	.
the	 denomi 	 nator 	 	of	the	 gym 	 n 	 osoph 	 ist 	 	's	life	was	 in 	 fin 	 ity 	 	.
so	,	no	matter	what	he	did	,	it	was	 al 	 ways 	 	zero	.
and	i	 believ 	 e 	 	it	is	 th 	 is 	 	 mytho 	 logical 	 	paradigm	that	inspired	indian	 mathematic 	 ians 	 	to	discover	the	number	zero	.
who	 know 	 s 	 	?
and	that	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	us	to	the	 mytho 	 logy 	 	of	business	.
if	alexander	's	belief	 influence 	 d 	 	his	behavior	,	if	the	 gym 	 n 	 osoph 	 ist 	 	's	belief	 influence 	 s 	 	his	behavior	,	then	it	was	bound	to	influence	the	business	they	 we 	 re 	 	in	.
you	see	,	what	is	business	but	the	result	of	how	the	market	 behav 	 es 	 	and	how	the	 organ 	 ization 	 	 behav 	 es 	 	?
and	if	you	look	at	 culture 	 s 	 	around	the	world	,	all	you	have	to	do	is	understand	the	 mytho 	 logy 	 	and	you	will	see	how	they	 behav 	 e 	 	and	how	they	do	business	.
take	a	look	.
if	you	live	 on 	 ly 	 	once	,	in	one	-	life	 culture 	 s 	 	around	the	world	,	you	will	see	an	obsession	with	 bin 	 ary 	 	logic	,	absolute	truth	,	 standard 	 ization 	 	,	 absolute 	 ness 	 	,	linear	 pattern 	 s 	 	in	design	.
but	if	you	look	at	 culture 	 s 	 	which	have	 cycl 	 ical 	 	and	based	on	infinite	 live 	 s 	 	,	you	will	see	a	comfort	with	 fuzz 	 y 	 	logic	,	with	opinion	,	with	contextual	 think 	 ing 	 	,	with	 every 	 thing 	 	is	 relat 	 ive 	 	,	sort	of	--	 most 	 ly 	 	.
you	look	at	art	.	look	at	the	 ball 	 er 	 ina 	 	,	how	linear	she	is	in	her	performance	.
and	then	look	at	the	indian	 classic 	 al 	 	 danc 	 er 	 	,	the	kuchipudi	 danc 	 er 	 	,	the	bharatanatyam	 danc 	 er 	 	,	 curv 	 ace 	 ous 	 	.
and	then	look	at	business	.
standard	business	model	:	vision	,	mission	,	 value 	 s 	 	,	 process 	 es 	 	.
 sound 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	like	the	journey	through	the	 wild 	 er 	 ness 	 	to	the	 promise 	 d 	 	land	,	with	the	 command 	 ments 	 	held	by	the	 lead 	 er 	 	.
and	if	you	 com 	 ply 	 	,	you	will	go	to	heaven	.
but	in	india	there	is	no	``	the	``	 promise 	 d 	 	land	.
there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 promise 	 d 	 	 land 	 s 	 	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	your	station	in	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	your	stage	of	life	.
you	see	,	 business 	 es 	 	are	not	run	 a 	 s 	 	 institution 	 s 	 	,	by	the	 idio 	 sync 	 ra 	 s 	 ies 	 	of	 individual 	 s 	 	.
it	's	 al 	 ways 	 	about	taste	.

there	is	no	orchestra	conductor	.
there	is	one	 perform 	 er 	 	 stand 	 ing 	 	there	,	and	 every 	 body 	 	 follow 	 s 	 	.
and	you	can	never	replicate	that	performance	twice	.
it	is	not	about	 document 	 ation 	 	and	contract	.
it	's	about	conversation	and	faith	.
it	's	not	about	compliance	.	it	's	about	setting	,	 get 	 ting 	 	the	job	 d 	 one 	 	,	by	 bend 	 ing 	 	or	 break 	 ing 	 	the	 rule 	 s 	 	--	just	look	at	your	indian	people	around	here	,	you	'll	see	them	 s 	 mile 	 	;	they	know	what	it	is	.
and	then	look	at	people	who	have	 d 	 one 	 	business	in	india	,	you	'll	see	the	 exa 	 s 	 per 	 ation 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 face 	 s 	 	.
you	see	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	india	is	 to 	 day 	 	.	the	ground	 re 	 ality 	 	is	based	on	a	 cycl 	 ical 	 	world	view	.

and	people	are	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	with	it	.
and	then	 global 	 ization 	 	is	taking	place	.
the	 demand 	 s 	 	of	modern	 institution 	 al 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	is	coming	in	.
which	is	 root 	 ed 	 	in	one	-	life	culture	.
and	a	 c 	 lash 	 	is	going	to	take	place	,	like	on	the	 bank 	 s 	 	of	the	indus	.
it	is	bound	to	happen	.
i	have	 personal 	 ly 	 	 experience 	 d 	 	it	.	i	'm	trained	 a 	 s 	 	a	medical	doctor	.
i	did	not	want	to	 stud 	 y 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	.	do	n't	ask	me	why	.
i	love	 mytho 	 logy 	 	too	much	.
i	 want 	 ed 	 	to	learn	 mytho 	 logy 	 	.	but	there	is	 no 	 where 	 	you	can	 stud 	 y 	 	.
so	,	i	had	to	teach	it	to	 my 	 self 	 	.
and	 mytho 	 logy 	 	 do 	 es 	 	not	pay	,	well	,	 un 	 til 	 	now	.
so	,	i	had	to	take	up	a	job	.	and	i	 work 	 ed 	 	in	the	pharma	industry	.
and	i	 work 	 ed 	 	in	the	 health 	 care 	 	industry	.
and	i	 work 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 market 	 ing 	 	guy	,	and	a	 sale 	 s 	 	guy	,	and	a	knowledge	guy	,	and	a	content	guy	,	and	a	training	guy	.
i	even	was	a	business	 consult 	 ant 	 	,	 do 	 ing 	 	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	and	 tactic 	 s 	 	.
and	i	would	see	the	 exa 	 s 	 per 	 ation 	 	between	my	american	and	european	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	,	when	they	 we 	 re 	 	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	india	.
 ex 	 ample 	 	:	 pleas 	 e 	 	tell	us	the	process	to	 in 	 voice 	 	 hospital 	 s 	 	.
step	a.	step	b.	step	c.	 most 	 ly 	 	.
how	do	you	 parameter 	 ize 	 	``	 most 	 ly 	 	``	?
how	do	you	put	it	in	a	nice	little	 soft 	 ware 	 	?	you	ca	n't	.
i	would	give	my	 view 	 point 	 s 	 	to	people	.
but	 no 	 body 	 	was	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	it	,	you	see	,	 un 	 til 	 	i	met	kishore	biyani	of	the	future	group	.
you	see	,	he	 ha 	 s 	 	 establish 	 ed 	 	the	largest	 re 	 tail 	 	chain	,	 call 	 ed 	 	big	bazaar	.
and	there	are	more	than	200	 format 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 cross 	 	50	cities	and	 town 	 s 	 	of	india	.
and	he	was	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	 divers 	 e 	 	and	dynamic	 market 	 s 	 	.
and	he	 k 	 new 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 intuitive 	 ly 	 	,	that	best	 practice 	 s 	 	,	 develop 	 ed 	 	in	japan	and	 chin 	 a 	 	and	europe	and	america	will	not	work	in	india	.
he	 k 	 new 	 	that	 institution 	 al 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	in	india	.	individual	 think 	 ing 	 	 do 	 es 	 	.
he	had	an	intuitive	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	the	 myth 	 ic 	 	structure	of	india	.
so	,	he	had	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	to	be	the	chief	belief	officer	,	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	all	i	want	to	do	is	align	belief	.	``
 sound 	 s 	 	so	simple	.
but	belief	is	not	 measur 	 able 	 	.
you	ca	n't	measure	it	.	you	ca	n't	manage	it	.
so	,	how	do	you	construct	belief	?
how	do	you	enhance	the	 sensitiv 	 ity 	 	of	people	to	indian	-	ness	.
even	if	you	are	indian	,	it	is	not	 ver 	 y 	 	 ex 	 plicit 	 	,	it	is	not	 ver 	 y 	 	obvious	.
so	,	i	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	work	on	the	standard	model	of	culture	,	which	is	,	develop	 st 	 ories 	 	,	 symbol 	 s 	 	and	 ritual 	 s 	 	.
and	i	will	share	one	of	the	 ritual 	 s 	 	with	you	.
you	see	it	is	based	on	the	hindu	ritual	of	darshan	.
hindus	do	n't	have	the	 con 	 cept 	 	of	 command 	 ments 	 	.
so	,	there	is	 noth 	 ing 	 	right	or	wrong	in	what	you	do	in	life	.
so	,	you	're	not	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	how	you	stand	in	front	of	god	.
so	,	when	you	go	to	the	temple	,	all	you	seek	is	an	audience	with	god	.
you	want	to	see	god	.
and	you	want	god	to	see	you	,	and	 h 	 ence 	 	the	 god 	 s 	 	have	 ver 	 y 	 	large	 eye 	 s 	 	,	large	 un 	 blink 	 ing 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	made	of	silver	,	so	they	look	at	you	.
 be 	 cause 	 	you	do	n't	know	 whet 	 her 	 	you	're	right	or	wrong	,	and	so	all	you	seek	is	divine	 empath 	 y 	 	.
``	just	know	where	i	came	from	,	why	i	did	the	 jug 	 a 	 ad 	 	.	``
``	why	did	i	do	the	setting	,	why	i	do	n't	care	for	the	 process 	 es 	 	.	just	understand	me	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	.	``
and	based	on	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	 create 	 d 	 	a	ritual	for	 lead 	 ers 	 	.
after	a	 lead 	 er 	 	 complete 	 s 	 	his	training	and	is	about	to	take	over	the	store	,	we	 blind 	 fold 	 	him	,	we	surround	him	with	the	 s 	 take 	 holder 	 s 	 	,	the	 custom 	 er 	 	,	his	family	,	his	team	,	his	 bo 	 s 	 s 	 	.
you	read	out	his	kra	,	his	kpi	,	you	give	him	the	 key 	 s 	 	,	and	then	you	 re 	 move 	 	the	 blind 	 fold 	 	.
and	 in 	 vari 	 ably 	 	,	you	see	a	tear	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 pen 	 ny 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 drop 	 ped 	 	.
he	 real 	 ize 	 s 	 	that	to	succeed	,	he	 do 	 es 	 	not	have	to	be	a	``	professional	,	``	he	 do 	 es 	 	not	have	to	cut	out	his	 emotion 	 s 	 	,	he	 ha 	 s 	 	to	include	all	these	people	in	his	world	to	succeed	,	to	make	them	happy	,	to	make	the	 bo 	 s 	 s 	 	happy	,	to	make	 every 	 one 	 	happy	.
the	 custom 	 er 	 	is	happy	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 custom 	 er 	 	is	god	.
that	 sensitiv 	 ity 	 	is	what	we	need	.	once	 th 	 is 	 	belief	 enter 	 s 	 	,	behavior	will	happen	,	business	will	happen	.
and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	.
so	,	then	we	come	back	to	alexander	and	to	the	 gym 	 n 	 osoph 	 ist 	 	.
and	 every 	 body 	 	 ask 	 s 	 	me	,	``	which	is	the	better	way	,	 th 	 is 	 	way	or	that	way	?	``
and	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	question	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 lead 	 s 	 	you	to	the	path	of	 fundamental 	 ism 	 	and	violence	.
so	,	i	will	not	answer	the	question	.
what	i	will	give	you	is	an	indian	answer	,	the	indian	head	-	shake	.
 depend 	 ing 	 	on	the	 con 	 text 	 	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	the	 out 	 come 	 	,	 choos 	 e 	 	your	paradigm	.
you	see	,	 be 	 cause 	 	both	the	 paradigm 	 s 	 	are	human	 construction 	 s 	 	.
they	are	cultural	 creation 	 s 	 	,	not	natural	 phenomen 	 a 	 	.
and	so	the	next	time	you	meet	 some 	 one 	 	,	a	 strange 	 r 	 	,	one	request	:	understand	that	you	live	in	the	 subject 	 ive 	 	truth	,	and	so	 do 	 es 	 	he	.
understand	it	.
and	when	you	understand	it	you	will	discover	 some 	 thing 	 	spectacular	.
you	will	discover	that	 with 	 in 	 	infinite	 myth 	 s 	 	lies	the	 e 	 ternal 	 	truth	.
who	 s 	 ees 	 	it	all	?
varuna	 ha 	 s 	 	but	a	thousand	 eye 	 s 	 	.
indra	,	a	hundred	.
you	and	i	,	 on 	 ly 	 	two	.
thank	you	.	namaste	.
